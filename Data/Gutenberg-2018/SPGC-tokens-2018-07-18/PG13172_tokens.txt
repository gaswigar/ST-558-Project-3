county
preface
the
narratives
composing
this
book
are
literally
true
stories
of
crime
in
a
majority
of
the
cases
the
author
conducted
the
prosecutions
himself
and
therefore
may
claim
to
have
a
personal
knowledge
of
that
whereof
he
speaks
while
no
confidence
has
been
abused
no
essential
facts
have
been
omitted
distorted
or
colored
and
the
accounts
themselves
being
all
matters
of
public
record
may
be
easily
verified
the
scenes
recorded
here
are
not
literature
but
history
and
the
characters
who
figure
in
them
are
not
puppets
of
the
imagination
but
men
and
women
who
lived
and
schemed
laughed
sinned
and
suffered
and
paid
the
price
when
the
time
came
most
of
them
without
flinching
a
few
of
those
who
read
these
pages
may
profit
perhaps
by
their
example
others
may
gain
somewhat
in
their
knowledge
of
life
and
human
nature
but
all
will
agree
that
there
are
books
in
the
running
brooks
even
if
the
streams
be
turbid
and
sermons
in
stones
though
these
be
the
hearts
of
men
if
in
some
instances
the
narratives
savor
in
treatment
more
of
fiction
than
of
fact
the
writer
must
plead
guilty
to
having
fallen
under
the
spell
of
the
romance
of
his
subject
and
he
proffers
the
excuse
that
whereas
such
tales
have
lost
nothing
in
accuracy
they
may
have
gained
in
the
truth
of
their

young
man
entered
the

asked
to
be
allowed
to
look
at

having
selected

to

and
arranged
for

he
produced

a
check
for
drawn
to
the
order
of
george

and
signed

and
remarked
to
the
attentive
salesman
i
have
got
quite
enough
cash
with
me
to
pay
for
these
but
i
have
been
intending
to
cash
this
check
all
the
afternoon
of
course
you
do
know
me
or
even
that
my
name
is

if
you
will
forward
the
check
to
the
bank
they
will
certify
it
and
i
will
send
for
the
suit
and
the
balance
of
the
money
certainly
lang
replied
the
salesman
i
will
hold
the
suit
and
the
money
to
await
your
orders
the
customer
thanked
him
and
took
his
departure
the
check
was
sent
to
the
bank
the
bank
certified
it
then
cancelled
its
certification
and
returned
the
check

the
boy
was
immediately
placed
under
arrest
and
after
proclaiming
his
own
innocence
and
vociferating
that
he
was
only
doing
an
errand
for
a
gent
who
was
waiting
close
by
was
directed
to
return
with
his
bundle
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
this
he
did
and
george
lang
was
soon
in
the
clutches
of
the
law
interrogated
by
his
captors
the
supposed
lang
admitted
that
his
real
name
was
james
parker
that
he
lived
at
west
street
and
only
requested
that
his
wife
be
immediately
notified
of
what
had
happened
at
headquarters
the
prisoner
was
identified
as
a
gentleman
who
had
been
very
actively
engaged
during
the
preceding
months
in
passing
bad
checks
throughout
the
city
his
more
recent
operations
having
consisted
in
cashing
a
check
on
the
lincoln
national
bank
for
on
july
one
for
on
the
same
bank
on
july
still
another
for
on
august
and
one
for
on
the
national
shoe
and
leather
bank
to
bearer
on
august
this
last
in
some
inexplicable
way
had
been
cashed
at
the
very
bank
itself
believing
that
the
forger
had
at
last
been
caught
the
precinct
detectives
later
on
during
the
evening
of
parker
arrest
visited
no
west
street
and
on
inquiring
for
parker
were
introduced
to
a
young
girl
of
attractive
appearance
to
whom
they
delivered
their
unwelcome
message
parker
seemed
overwhelmed
at
the
news
and
strongly
asserted
her
confidence
in
her
husband
innocence
of
any
having
performed
their
errand
the
officers
departed
a
certain
ineradicable
jealousy
has
always
existed
between
the
men
of
the
various
precincts
and
the
sleuths
attached
to
the
central
office
and
in
this
instance
the
precinct
men
having
gained
the
credit
for
the
arrest
it
did
not
occur
to
them
as
necessary
to
communicate
the
knowledge
of
their
acquaintance
with
parker
to
detective
sergeants
peabody
and
clark
originally
assigned
at
headquarters
to
investigate
the
case
it
seemed
however
to
peabody
very
unlikely
that
parker
had
conducted
his
operations
alone
and
he
therefore
at
once
inquired
at
the
tombs
what
character
of
visitors
came
to
see
the
prisoner
the
gateman
replied
that
as
yet
none
had
arrived
at
that
very
instant
a
young
girl
stepped
to
the
wicket
and
asked
if
she
could
be
allowed
to
see
james
parker
it
took
the
detective
but
a
moment
to
run
across
to
the
criminal
courts
building
and
to
telephone
the
warden
to
detain
her
temporarily
and
then
to
refuse
her
request
five
minutes
later
the
girl
emerged
disconsolately
from
the
tombs
and
boarded
a
car
going
uptown
peabody
followed
her
to
west
street
not
for
an
instant
supposing
that
the
girl
herself
could
be
the
forger
but
believing
that
possibly
through
her
he
might
learn
of
other
members
of
the
gang
and
secure
additional
evidence
against
parker
himself
of
course
no
intelligent
person
supposes
that
outside
of
sir
conan
doyle
interesting
novels
detectives
seek
the
baffling
criminal
by
means
of
analyzing
cigar
butts
magnifying
thumb
marks
or
specializing
in
the
various
perfumes
in
favor
among
the
fair
sex
or
by
any
of
those
complicated
brain
fatiguing
processes
of
ratiocination
indulged
in
by
our
old
friend
sherlock
holmes
there
are
still
however
genuine
detectives
and
some
of
them
are
to
be
found
upon
the
new
york
police
force
the
magnifying
glass
is
not
one
of
the
ordinary
tools
of
the
professional
sleuth
and
if
he
carries
a
pistol
at
all
it
is
because
the
police
rules
require
it
while
those
cases
may
be
numbered
upon
the
fingers
of
two
hands
where
his
own
hair
and
whiskers
are
not
entirely
sufficient
for
his
purposes
in
the
course
of
his
professional
career
the
next
morning
peabody
donned
the
most
disreputable
suit
in
his
wardrobe
neglected
his
ordinary
visit
to
the
barber
and
called
at
west
street
being
of
course
at
this
time
entirely
unaware
of
the
fact
that
the
girl
was
parker
wife
he
found
her
sitting
in
a
rocking
chair
in
a
comfortable
room
and
reading
a
magazine
assuming
an
expression
of
sheepish
inanity
he
informed
her
that
he
was
an
old
pal
of
jim
who
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
locked
up
in
the
same
cell
with
him
at
headquarters
and
that
the
latter
was
in
desperate
need
of
morphine
that
parker
was
an
habitual
user
of
the
drug
could
be
easily
seen
from
the
most
casual
inspection
but
that
it
would
prove
an
open
sesame
to
the
girl
confidence
was
as
the
detective
afterward
testified
a
shot
poor
jim
exclaimed
the
girl
could
you
smuggle
some
into
the
tombs
for
him
peabody
took
the
hint
of
course
he
could
it
would
be
a
hard
job
those
turnkeys
were
so
suspicious
but
could
do
it
for
her
if
anybody
could
he
rambled
on
telling
his
experiences
with
parker
in
the
past
how
he
had
been
in
elmira
reformatory
and
elsewhere
with
him
and
gaining
each
moment
valuable
information
from
the
girl
exclamations
questions
and
expression
he
soon
learned
that
she
was
parker
wife
that
they
were
living
in
comparative
comfort
and
that
she
was
an
exceedingly
clever
and
woman
but
she
said
nothing
during
the
conversation
which
would
indicate
that
she
knew
anything
of
her
husband
offenses
or
of
any
persons
connected
with
them
after
a
few
moments
the
girl
slipped
on
her
coat
and
hat
and
the
two
started
down
to
the
tombs
where
by
prearrangement
with
the
officials
the
detective
succeeded
in
convincing
her
that
he
had
been
able
to
send
in
to
her
husband
a
small
hypodermic
syringe
commonly
called
the
needles
which
she
had
purchased
at
a
neighboring
drug
store
the
apparent
success
of
this
undertaking
put
parker
in
excellent
humor
and
she
invited
the
supposed
crook
to
breakfast
with
her
at
the
broadway
central
hotel
so
far
it
will
be
observed
peabody
had
accomplished
practically
nothing
at
breakfast
the
girl
inquired
of
her
companion
what
his
particular
graft
was
to
which
he
replied
that
he
was
an
expert
second
story
man
and
then
proceeded
to
indulge
his
imagination
in
accounts
of
bold
robberies
in
the
brown
stone
districts
and
clever
tricks
in
other
cities
which
left
parker
in
no
doubt
but
that
her
companion
was
an
expert
gun
of
long
experience
then
he
took
as
he
expressed
it
another
chance
jim
wanted
me
to
tell
you
to
put
the
gang
said
he
the
girl
looked
at
him
sharply
and
contracted
her
brows
gang
she
exclaimed
what
gang
oh
perhaps
he
meant
and
peabody
bit
his
lip
he
had
had
a
close
call
do
know
he
replied
he
did
say
who
they
were
just
to
put
them
a
second
time
the
detective
had
made
a
lucky
hit
for
parker
suddenly
laid
aside
all
pretense
and
asked
do
you
want
to
make
a
lot
of
money
peabody
allowed
that
he
did
do
you
know
what
they
have
got
jim
for
asked
the
girl
paper
was
it
yes
said
parker
but
jim
did
write
those
checks
i
wrote
them
myself
if
you
want
to
go
in
with
me
we
can
earn
enough
money
to
get
jim
out
and
you
can
do
a
good
turn
for
yourself
besides
the
detective
blood
leaped
in
his
veins
but
he
held
himself
under
control
as
well
as
he
could
and
answered
indifferently
i
guess
not
i
never
met
a
woman
that
was
very
good
at
that
sort
of
game
oh
you
do
know
she
persisted
why
i
can
copy
anything
in
a
few
moments
really
i
can
too
dangerous
remarked
peabody
i
might
get
settled
for
ten
years
no
you
would
she
continued
it
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
pick
the
mail
out
of
some
box
on
a
corner
i
can
show
you
how
with
a
copper
wire
and
a
little
piece
of
wax
and
you
are
sure
to
find
among
the
letters
somebody
check
in
payment
of
a
bill
there
at
once
you
have
the
bank
and
the
signature
then
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
write
a
letter
to
the
bank
asking
for
a
new
check
book
saying
yours
is
used
up
and
sign
the
name
that
appears
on
the
check
if
you
can
fool
the
cashier
into
giving
your
messenger
a
check
book
you
can
gamble
pretty
safely
on
his
paying
a
check
signed
with
the
same
name
in
that
way
you
see
you
can
get
all
the
blank
checks
you
need
and
test
the
cashier
watchfulness
at
the
same
time
it
too
easy
the
only
thing
you
have
to
look
out
for
is
not
to
overdraw
the
account
still
you
find
so
many
checks
in
the
mail
that
you
can
usually
choose
somebody
account
that
will
stand
the
strain
do
you
know
i
have
made
of
checks
and
the
banks
have
certified
every
single
one
peabody
laughed
good
naturedly
things
were
looking
up
a
bit
what
do
you
think
i
am
anyhow
he
asked
i
must
look
like
a
i
giving
it
to
you
straight
she
said
simply
after
you
have
made
out
a
good
fat
check
then
you
go
to
a
store
buy
something
tell
them
to
forward
the
check
to
the
bank
for
certification
and
that
you
send
for
the
goods
and
the
change
the
next
day
the
bank
always
certifies
the
check
and
you
get
the
money
not
always
said
peabody
with
a
grin
no
not
always
acquiesced
parker
but
jim
and
i
have
been
averaging
over
a
hundred
dollars
a
day
for
months
good
graft
all
right
assented
the
detective
but
how
does
the
one
who
lays
down
the
check
identify
himself
for
instance
suppose
i
go
into
tiffany
and
pick
out
a
diamond
and
say
i
john
smith
of
west
one
hundredth
street
and
the
floorwalker
says
smith
but
we
do
know
you
what
then
just
flash
a
few
letters
on
him
said
the
girl
letters
and
envelopes
where
do
you
get
asked
peabody
just
write
them
silly
and
send
them
to
yourself
through
the
mail
that
all
right
retorted
the
second
story
man
but
how
can
i
mail
myself
a
letter
to
west
one
hundredth
street
i
do
live
parker
smiled
in
a
superior
manner
i
glad
i
can
put
you
wise
to
a
new
game
i
invented
it
myself
you
want
letters
of
identification
in
different
names
and
addresses
on
different
days
very
good
buy
a
bundle
of
stamped
envelopes
and
write
your
own
name
and
address
on
them
when
they
arrive
rub
off
the
pencil
address
then
if
you
want
to
be
john
smith
of
west
one
hundredth
street
or
anybody
else
just
address
the
cancelled
envelope
mabel
said
peabody
with
admiration
you
got
the
matter
all
right
you
can
have
if
you
can
deliver
the
rest
of
the
goods
illustration
a
frill
of
mabel
parker
there
still
another
little
frill
she
continued
pleased
at
his
compliment
if
you
want
to
do
the
thing
in
style
maybe
you
will
find
a
letter
or
bill
head
in
the
mail
at
the
same

you
get
your

you
do

can
have
it
copied
and
write
your
request
for
the

book
and
your

for
the

on
paper
printed
exactly
like
it
that
gives
a
sort
of
final
touch
you
know
i
remember
we
did
that
with
a
dentist
named
budd
at
west
street
fig
you
got
all
the
rest
whipped
to
a
standstill
cried
peabody
well
just
come
over
to
the
room
and
i
show
you
something
worth
while
exclaimed
the
girl
getting
up
and
paying
their
bill
now
said
she
when
they
were
safely
at
no
west
street
and
she
had
closed
the
door
of
the
room
and
drawn
peabody
to
a
desk
in
the
bay
window
here
my
regular
handwriting
she
pulled
towards
her
a
pad
which
lay
open
upon
the
desk
and
wrote
in
a
fair
round
hand
james
d
singley
fig
this
she
continued
changing
her
slant
and
dashing
off
a
queer
feminine
scrawl
is
the
signature
we
fooled
the
lincoln
national
bank
with
miss
kauser
you
know
and
this
she
added
a
moment
later
adopting
a
stiff
shaky
orthography
is
the
signature
that
got
poor
jim
into
all
this
trouble
and
she
inscribed
twice
upon
the
paper
the
name
e
bierstadt
poor
jim
she
added
to
herself
by
george
mabel
remarked
the
detective
you
a
wonder
see
if
you
can
copy
name
and
peabody
wrote
the
assumed
name
of
william
hickey
first
with
a
stub
and
then
with
a
fine
point
both
of
which
signatures
she
copied
like
a
flash
in
each
case
however
being
guilty
of
the
lapse
of
spelling
the
word
the
pad
now
contained
more
than
enough
evidence
to
convict
twenty
women
and
peabody
with
the
remark
you
do
want
to
leave
this
kind
of
thing
lying
around
mabel
pretended
to
tear
the
page
up
but
substituted
a
blank
sheet
in
its
place
and
smuggled
the
precious
bit
of
paper
into
his
pocket
yes
i
go
into
business
with
you
sure
i
will
said
peabody
and
we
get
enough
money
to
set
jim
free
exclaimed
the
girl
they
were
now
fast
friends
and
it
was
agreed
that
hickey
should
go
and
make
himself
presentable
after
which
they
would
dine
at
some
restaurant
and
then
sample
a
convenient
mail
box
meantime
peabody
telephoned
to
headquarters
and
when
the
two
set
out
for
dinner
at
six
the
supposed
hickey
was
stopped
on
broadway
by
detective
sergeant
clark
what
are
you
doing
here
in
new
york
demanded
clark
did
i
give
you
six
hours
to
fly
the
coop
and
who
this
woman
illustration
fig
the
upper
signature
is
an
example
of
mabel
parker
regular
penmanship
the
next
two
are
forgeries
from
memory
and
the
last
is
a
dashing
imitation
of
her
companion
handwriting
i
was
going
clark
honest
i
was
whined
hickey
and
this
all
right
she
has
done
a
thing
well
i
guess
i
have
to
lock
you
up
at
headquarters
for
the
night
said
clark
roughly
the
girl
can
go
oh
clark
do
come
and
have
dinner
with
us
first
exclaimed
parker
hickey
has
been
very
good
to
me
and
he
has
had
anything
to
eat
for
ever
so
long
do
care
if
i
do
said
clark
i
guess
i
can
put
up
with
the
company
if
the
board
is
good
the
three
entered
the
raleigh
hotel
and
ordered
a
substantial
meal
with
the
arrival
of
dessert
however
the
girl
became
uneasy
and
apparently
fearing
arrest
herself
slipped
a
roll
of
bills
under
the
table
to
hickey
and
whispered
to
him
to
keep
it
for
her
the
detective
thinking
that
the
farce
had
gone
far
enough
threw
the
money
on
the
table
and
asked
clark
to
count
it
at
the
same
tune
telling
parker
that
she
was
in
custody
the
girl
turned
white
uttered
a
little
scream
and
then
regaining
her
remarked
as
nonchalently
as
you
please
well
clever
as
you
think
you
are
you
have
destroyed
the
only
evidence
against
me
my
handwriting
not
much
remarked
peabody
producing
the
sheet
of
paper
the
girl
saw
that
the
game
was
up
and
made
a
mock
bow
to
the
two
detectives
i
take
off
my
hat
to
the
new
york
police
said
she
at
this
time
apparently
no
thought
of
denying
her
guilt
had
entered
her
mind
and
at
the
station
house
she
talked
freely
to
the
sergeant
the
matron
and
the
various
newspaper
men
who
were
present
even
drawing
pictures
of
herself
upon
loose
sheets
of
paper
and
signing
her
name
apparently
rather
enjoying
the
notoriety
which
her
arrest
had
occasioned
a
thorough
search
of
her
apartment
was
now
made
with
the
result
that
several
sheets
of
paper
were
found
there
bearing
what
were
evidently
practice
signatures
of
the
name
of
alice
kauser
fig
evidence
was
also
obtained
showing
that
on
the
day
following
her
husband
arrest
she
had
destroyed
large
quantities
of
blank
check
books
and
blank
checks
upon
the
trial
of
parker
the
experts
testified
that
the
bierstadt
and
kauser
signatures
were
so
perfect
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
state
that
they
were
not
originals
the
parker
woman
was
what
is
sometimes
known
as
a
free
hand
forger
she
never
traced
anything
and
as
her
forgeries
were
written
by
a
muscular
imitation
of
the
pen
movement
of
the
writer
of
the
genuine
signature
they
were
almost
impossible
of
detection
when
albert
patrick
forged
the
signature
of
old
rice
to
the
spurious
will
of
and
to
the
checks
for
and
upon
swenson
bank
and
the
fifth
avenue
trust
the
forgeries
were
easily
detected
from
the
fact
that
as
patrick
had
them
they
were
almost
exactly
alike
and
practically
could
be
superimposed
one
upon
another

mabel
parker
early
history
is
shrouded
in
a
certain
amount
of
obscurity
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
she
was
the
offspring
of
respectable
laboring
people
who
turned
her
over
while
she
was
still
an
infant
to
a
and
prentice
instructors
in
physical
culture
in
the
public
schools
first
of
louis
and
later
of
paul
minnesota
as
a
child
and
afterwards
as
a
young
girl
she
exhibited
great
precocity
and
a
considerable
amount
of
real
ability
in
drawing
and
in
english
composition
but
her
very
cleverness
and
versatility
were
the
means
of
her
becoming
much
more
sophisticated
than
most
young
women
of
her
age
with
the
result
that
while
still
in
her
teens
she
gave
her
adopted
parents
ground
for
considerable
uneasiness
accordingly
they
decided
to
place
her
for
the
next
few
years
in
a
convent
near
new
york
by
this
time
she
had
attained
a
high
degree
of
proficiency
in
writing
short
stories
and
miscellaneous
articles
which
she
illustrated
herself
for
the
papers
and
inferior
magazines
convent
life
proved
very
dull
for
this
young
lady
and
accordingly
one
dark
evening
she
made
her
exit
from
the
cloister
by
means
of
a
conveniently
located
window
waiting
for
her
in
the
grounds
below
was
james
parker
years
old
already
of
a
large
criminal
experience
although
never
yet
convicted
of
crime
the
two
made
their
way
to
new
york
were
married
and
the
girl
entered
upon
her
career
her
husband
whose
real
name
was
james
singley
was
a
professional
tenderloin
crook
ready
to
turn
his
hand
to
any
sort
of
cheap
crime
to
satisfy
his
appetites
and
support
life
the
money
easily
secured
was
easily
spent
and
singley
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
was
addicted
to
most
of
the
vices
common
to
the
habitués
of
the
under
world
his
worst
enemy
was
the
morphine
habit
and
from
her
husband
singley
speedily
learned
the
use
of
the
drug
at
this
time
mabel
was
about
five
feet
two
inches
in
height
weighing
not
more
than
or
pounds
slender
to
girlishness
and
showing
no
maturity
save
in
her
face
which
with
its
high
color
brilliant
blue
eyes
and
her
yellow
hair
often
led
those
who
glanced
at
her
casually
to
think
her
good
looking
further
inspection
however
revealed
a
expression
an
irregularity
in
the
position
of
the
eyes
a
hardness
in
the
lines
of
the
mouth
and
a
flatness
of
the
nose
which
belied
the
first
impression
this
was
particularly
true
when
after
being
deprived
of
morphine
in
the
tombs
her
ordinary
high
color
gave
way
at
her
second
trial
to
a
waxy
paleness
of
complexion
but
the
story
of
her
career
in
the
tenderloin
would
prove
neither
profitable
nor
attractive
illustration
fig
the
check
on
which
the
indictment
for
forgery
was
brought
the
subsequent
history
of
the
parker
case
is
a
startling
example
of
the
credulity
of
the
ordinary
jury
the
evidence
secured
was
absolutely
conclusive
but
unfortunately
juries
are
generally
unwilling
to
take
the
uncorroborated
word
of
a
policeman
against
that
of
a
defendant
particularly
if
the
defendant
be
a
young
and
pretty
woman
here
at
the
very
outset
was
a
complete
confession
on
the
part
of
parker
supplemented
by
illustrations
from
her
own
pen
of
what
she
could
do
comparison
showed
that
the
signatures
she
had
written
without
a
model
upon
the
peabody
sheet
were
identical
with
those
upon
the
forged
checks
fig
and
with
bierstadt
and
miss
kauser
handwriting
when
parker
case
therefore
came
on
for
pleading
her
counsel
probably
because
they
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
do
entered
a
plea
of
it
was
also
intimated
that
the
young
woman
would
probably
plead
guilty
and
the
case
was
therefore
placed
upon
the
calendar
and
moved
for
trial
without
much
preparation
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
instead
of
this
young
person
confessing
her
guilt
however
she
amused
herself
by
ogling
the
jury
and
drawing
pictures
of
the
court
the
district
attorney
and
the
various
witnesses
probably
no
more
extraordinary
scene
was
ever
beheld
in
a
court
of
law
than
that
exhibited
by
part
ii
of
the
general
sessions
upon
mabel
parker
first
trial
for
forgery
attired
in
a
sky
blue
dress
and
picture
hat
with
new
white
gloves
she
sat
jauntily
by
the
side
of
her
counsel
throughout
the
proceedings
toying
with
her
pen
and
pencil
and
in
the
very
presence
of
the
jury
copying
handwriting
which
was
given
her
for
that
purpose
by
various
members
of
the
yellow
press
who
crowded
close
behind
the
rail
from
time
to
time
she
would
dash
off
an
aphorism
or
a
paragraph
in
regard
to
the
trial
which
she
handed
to
a
reporter
if
satisfactory
this
was
elaborated
and
sometimes
even
illustrated
by
her
for
the
evening
edition
of
his
paper
the
assistant
district
attorney
complained
that
this
was
clearly
a
contempt
of
court
particularly
as
the
defendant
had
drawn
a
picture
not
only
of
himself
but
of
the
presiding
justice
and
a
witness
which
had
appeared
in
one
of
the
evening
papers
the
court
however
did
not
see
that
anything
could
be
done
about
it
and
the
girl
openly
continued
her
literary
and
artistic
recreation
the
court
itself
was
not
a
little
amused
at
the
actions
of
the
defendant
and
when
detective
peabody
was
called
to
the
stand
the
general
hilarity
had
reached
such
a
pitch
that
he
was
unable
to
give
his
testimony
without
smiling
the
natural
result
therefore
at
the
first
trial
was
that
the
detective
succeeded
in
giving
the
unqualified
impression
that
he
was
drawing
the
long
bow
in
a
most
preposterous
fashion
at
the
conclusion
of
the
people
case
the
evidence
that
parker
had
forged
the
checks
amounted
simply
to
this
that
an
officer
who
was
greatly
interested
in
her
conviction
had
sworn
to
a
most
astonishing
series
of
facts
from
which
the
jury
must
infer
that
this
exceedingly
astute
young
person
had
not
only
been
entirely
and
completely
deceived
by
a
detective
but
also
that
at
almost
their
first
meeting
she
had
confessed
to
him
in
detail
the
history
of
her
crimes
practically
the
only
other
evidence
tending
to
corroborate
his
story
were
a
few
admissions
of
a
similar
character
made
by
her
to
newspaper
men
matrons
and
officers
at
the
police
station
unless
the
jury
were
to
believe
that
parker
had
actually
written
the
signatures
on
the
peabody
sheet
there
was
no
evidence
that
she
was
the
actual
forger
hence
upon
peabody
word
alone
depended
the
verdict
of
the
jury
the
trouble
with
the
case
was
that
it
was
strong
good
to
be
entirely
credible
and
had
there
been
no
defense
it
is
exceedingly
probable
that
the
trial
would
have
resulted
in
an
acquittal
since
the
prosecution
had
elected
to
go
to
the
jury
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
had
actually
signed
the
checks
herself
parker
however
had
withdrawn
her
plea
of
insanity
and
determined
to
put
in
a
defense
which
proved
in
its
turn
to
be
even
more
extraordinary
than
the
case
against
her
this
in
brief
was
to
the
effect
that
she
had
known
peabody
to
be
a
police
officer
all
along
but
that
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
if
she
could
deceive
him
into
believing
that
it
was
she
who
had
committed
the
forgeries
her
husband
might
get
off
and
that
later
she
might
in
turn
establish
her
own
innocence
she
had
therefore
hastily
scratched
her
name
on
the
top
of
a
sheet
already
containing
her
husband
handwriting
and
had
told
peabody
that
the
signatures
had
been
written
by
herself
that
the
sheet
had
been
written
in
the
officer
presence
she
declared
to
be
a
pure
invention
on
his
part
to
secure
her
conviction
she
told
her
extremely
illogical
story
with
a
certain
winsome
naïveté
which
carried
an
air
of
with
it
from
her
deportment
on
the
stand
one
would
have
taken
her
for
a
boarding
school
miss
who
in
some
inconsequent
fashion
had
got
mixed
up
in
a
frolic
for
which
no
really
logical
explanation
could
be
given
then
the
door
in
the
back
of
the
court
room
opened
and
james
parker
was
led
to
the
bar
where
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
forgery
of
the
very
signature
for
which
his
wife
was
standing
trial
kauser
check
fig
he
was
then
sworn
as
a
witness
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
had
written
all
the
forged
signatures
to
the
checks
including
the
signatures
upon
the
peabody
sheet
the
district
attorney
found
himself
in
an
embarrassing
position
if
parker
was
the
forger
why
not
challenge
him
to
write
the
forged
signatures
upon
the
witness
stand
and
thus
to
prove
his
alleged
capacity
for
so
doing
the
obvious
objection
to
this
was
that
parker
in
anticipation
of
this
test
had
probably
been
practicing
the
signature
in
the
tombs
for
months
on
the
other
hand
if
the
district
attorney
did
not
challenge
him
to
write
the
signatures
the
defense
would
argue
that
he
was
afraid
to
do
so
and
that
as
parker
had
sworn
himself
to
be
the
forger
it
was
not
incumbent
upon
the
defense
to
prove
it
further
that
that
was
a
matter
for
cross
examination
with
considerable
hesitation
the
prosecuting
attorney
asked
parker
to
write
the
kauser
signature
which
was
the
one
set
forth
in
the
indictment
charging
the
forgery
and
after
much
backing
and
filling
on
the
part
of
the
witness
who
ingeniously
complained
that
he
was
in
a
bad
nervous
condition
owing
to
lack
of
morphine
in
consequence
of
which
his
hand
trembled
and
he
was
in
no
condition
to
write
forgeries
the
latter
took
his
pen
and
managed
to
make
a
very
fair
copy
of
the
kauser
signature
from
memory
good
enough
in
fact
to
warrant
a
jury
in
forming
the
conclusion
that
he
was
in
fact
the
forger
fig
this
closed
the
case
the
defense
claimed
that
it
was
clear
that
james
parker
was
the
forger
since
he
had
admitted
it
in
open
court
pleaded
guilty
to
the
indictment
and
proved
that
he
had
the
capacity
the
prosecution
upon
the
other
hand
argued
that
the
evidence
was
conclusive
that
the
defendant
herself
was
the
writer
of
the
check
the
whole
thing
boiled
down
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
was
going
to
believe
that
parker
had
written
the
peabody
sheet
in
the
presence
of
the
detective
when
her
husband
claimed
that
with
the
exception

room
illustration
fig
parker
copy
of
the
signature
of
alice
kauser
made
in
court
in
an
attempt
to
shield
his
wife
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
at
his
wits
end
for
an
argument
to
meet
the
fact
that
parker
had
written
a
sample
forgery
of
the
kauser
signature
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
jury
he
found
it
at
last
in
an
offer
on
his
own
part
in
open
court
during
his
summing
up
to
write
for
the
jury
from
memory
a
better
forgery
of
the
kauser
signature
than
that
written
by
parker
himself
and
thus
to
show
how
simple
a
matter
it
was
to
learn
to
do
so
he
had
taken
up
his
pen
and
was
about
to
give
a
sample
of
his
handiwork
in
this
respect
when
the
defendant
grasped
her
counsel
arm
and
whispered
for
god
sake
do
let
him
do
it
whereupon
the
lawyer
arose
and
objected
saying
that
such
evidence
was
improper
as
the
case
was
closed
as
might
have
been
expected
under
the
circumstances
considering
the
blunders
of
the
prosecution
and
the
ingenuous
appearance
of
the
defendant
the
trial
ended
in
a
disagreement
the
jury
standing
eight
to
four
for
acquittal
the
district
attorney
office
now
took
up
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
case
with
the
result
that
on
a
second
prosecution
parker
was
confronted
with
a
mass
of
evidence
which
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
refute
a
boy
named
wallace
sweeney
sentenced
to
the
elmira
reformatory
was
found
to
have
been
an
active
accomplice
of
the
parkers
for
several
years
and
he
was
accordingly
brought
down
to
new
york
where
he
gave
a
complete
history
of
his
relations
with
them
his
story
proved
beyond
any
doubt
that
parker
was
the
forger
of
the
checks
in
the
possession
of
the
district
attorney
and
of
many
others
beside
some
of
them
for
very
large
amounts
the
evidence
of
sweeney
was
of
itself
quite
sufficient
to
warrant
a
conviction
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
however
the
district
attorney
upon
the
second
trial
moved
a
new
indictment
setting
forth
as
the
forgery
a
check
signed
bierstadt
so
that
when
parker
took
the
stand
as
he
had
done
in
the
former
trial
and
testified
that
he
was
the
forger
he
found
himself
unable
to
write
this
new
signature
and
hence
his
testimony
went
for
nothing
but
even
the
testimony
of
sweeney
was
that
of
an
accomplice
requiring
corroboration
while
that
of
peabody
remained
the
evidence
of
a
mere
policeman
eager
to
convict
the
defendant
and
add
another
scalp
to
his
official
belt
with
an
extraordinary
accumulation
of
evidence
the
case
hinged
on
the
veracity
of
these
two
men
to
which
was
opposed
the
denial
of
the
defendant
and
her
husband
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
in
the
final
analysis
of
the
case
the
jury
were
compelled
to
determine
the
issue
by
evidence
entirely
documentary
in
character
it
is
also
an
illustration
of
what
tiny
facts
stamp
whole
masses
of
testimony
as
true
or
false
on
her
examination
parker
had
sworn
among
other
things
that
she
had
no
knowledge
of
the
envelope
the
back
of
which
had
been
used
by
parker
for
the
purpose
of
directing
rogers
peet
to
deliver
the
clothes
and
money
to
his
messenger
and
of
course
that
the
words
geo
lang
were
not
in
her
handwriting
this
was
one
of
the
envelopes
claimed
by
the
prosecution
to
have
been
originally
addressed
in
pencil
and
sent
to
themselves
by
the
parkers
through
the
mail
for
this
precise
purpose
that
she
had
never
seen
the
kauser
practice
sheets
and
that
the
words
alice
kauser
repeated
hundreds
of
times
thereon
were
not
in
her
handwriting
for
some
reason
unknown
to
the
district
attorney
however
she
admitted
having
written
the
words
i
am
upstairs
in
the
upon
a
similar
sheet
but
claimed
that
at
the
time
this
was
done
the
reverse
of
the
paper
was
entirely
blank
microscopic
examination
showed
that
among
the
words
alice
and
kauser
on
the
practice
sheets
some
one
had
written
a
capital
one
of
the
legs
of
the
m
crossed
and
was
superimposed
upon
a
letter
in
the
word
alice
hence
whoever
wrote
the
m
knew
what
was
on
the
practice
sheet
an
enlargement
of
this
m
and
a
comparison
of
it
with
the
m
in
the
defendant
signature
to
her
formal
examination
in
the
police
court
with
the
m
in
in
the
address
on
the
envelope
and
with
that
in
the
on
the
peabody
sheet
rendered
it
obvious
that
they
were
all
written
by
one
and
the
same
hand
therefore
it
was
clear
that
the
defendant
was
familiar
with
the
contents
of
the
practice
sheets
fig
even
if
she
had
not
written
them
herself
and
had
not
told
the
truth
in
this
regard
moreover
it
was
fairly
easy
to
see
that
the
same
hand
that
had
written
the
words
i
am
upstairs
in
the
upon
the
second
practice
sheet
had
at
the
same
time
and
with
the
same
pen
written
the
rest
of
the
sheet
this
was
clearly
perceptible
on
examining
the
e
and
a
a
comparison
of
the
address
geo
lang
on
fig
with
the
name
james
singley
on
fig
also
shows
clearly
that
one
and
the
same
person
wrote
them
both
and
to
the
accuracy
of
all
these
propositions
a
leading
handwriting
expert
in
new
york
added
his
unqualified
opinion
thus
but
for
a
little
carelessness
in
failing
to
destroy
odd
scraps
of
paper
and
to
disguise
her
penmanship
which
it
seemed
to
her
quite
unnecessary
to
do
as
in
the
address
of
the
lang
envelope
parker
might
well
have
gone
free
after
all
it
is
impossible
to
describe
all
the
varied
dramatic
features
of
this
interesting
case
no
one
who
was
present
is
likely
to
forget
the
impression
made
by
the
defendant
at
her
second
trial
when
in
defiance
of
overwhelming
proof
she
still
struggled
to
vindicate
herself
her
counsel
contended
throughout
the
trial
that
she
was
a
hitherto
innocent
young
woman
led
astray
and
started
upon
a
criminal
career
by
a
rascally
husband
whom
she
still
loved
devotedly
and
for
whose
sake
she
had
prepared
to
confess
herself
a
criminal
that
james
parker
introduced
his
wife
to
a
life
of
crime
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
she
had
a
natural
predilection
for
it
must
be
equally
obvious
it
is
probably
true
that
mabel
parker
affection
for
her
convict
husband
was
unfeigned
and
deep
the
natural
repugnance
of
the
american
jury
for
convicting
a
woman
was
shown
when
in
spite
of
the
overwhelming
proof
upon
the
parker
woman
second
trial
the
jury
remained
out
eight
hours
and
then
found
her
guilty
of
uttering
only
with
a
strong
recommendation
for
mercy
she
was
sentenced
to
the
bedford
reformatory
illustration
fig
one
of
the
loose
sheets
upon
which
mabel
parker
illustrated
her
methods
and
her
skill
as
a
penman
to
the
supposed
hickey
ii
five
hundred
million
dollars
this
story
which
ends
in
new
york
begins
in
the
department
of
the
gironde
at
the
town
of
monségur
kilometers
from
bordeaux
in
the
little
vineyard
of
monsieur
emile
lapierre
landowner
in
lapierre
was
a
happy
and
contented
man
making
a
good
living
out
of
his
modest
farm
he
is
well
if
you
understand
the
language
of
the
gironde
he
will
tell
you
with
a
shrug
of
his
broad
shoulders
that
he
might
have
been
a
monte
cristo
had
not
bon
willed
it
otherwise
for
did
he
not
almost
have
five
hundred
million
dollars
two
and
a
half
of
francs
in
his
very
hands
but
he
did
does
have
doubts
nevertheless
it
is
all
true
trop
is
tired
and
would
he
care
to
hear
the
story
there
is
a
comfortable
chair
le
grand
in
front
of
the
veranda
and
madame
will
give
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
presses
across
the
road
yes
it
good
wine
but
there
is
little
profit
in
it
when
one
thinks
in
the
landowner
lights
his
pipe
and
seats
himself
against
the
trunk
of
the
big
chestnut
back
of
the
house
the
vineyard
slopes
away
toward
the
distant
woods
in
straight
green
trellised
alleys
a
dim
haze
hangs
over
the
landscape
sleeping
so
quietly
in
the
midsummer
afternoon
down
the
road
comes
heavily
creaking
and
swaying
a
wain
loaded
with
a
huge
tower
of
empty
casks
and
drawn
by
two
oxen
their
heads
swinging
to
the
dust
yes
it
is
hard
to
hundred
million
francs
it
was
this
way
madame
lapierre
was
a
tessier
of
bordeaux
an
ancient
family
and
very
proud
indeed
of
being
you
can
see
her
passing
and
repassing
the
window
if
you
watch
carefully
the
kitchen
where
she
is
superintending
dinner
the
tessiers
have
always
lived
in
bordeaux
and
they
are
connected
by
marriage
with
everybody
from
the
blacksmith
up
to
the
mayor
notary
once
a
tessier
was
mayor
himself
years
and
years
ago
madame
jean
had
emigrated
to
america
and
from
time
to
time
vague
rumors
of
the
wealth
he
had
achieved
in
the
new
country
reached
the
ears
of
his
relatives
but
no
direct
word
ever
came
then
one
hot
day
like
this
appeared
le
général
he
came
walking
down
the
road
in
the
dust
from
the
in
his
tall
silk
hat
and
frock
coat
and
cane
and
stopped
before
the
house
to
ask
if
one
of
the
descendants
of
a
certain
jean
tessier
did
not
live
hereabouts
he
was
fat
and
and
he
perspired
but
he
was
and
he
had
an
order
in
his
buttonhole
madame
lapierre
who
came
out
to
answer
his
question
knew
at
once
that
he
was
an
aristocrat
ah
was
she
herself
the
grandniece
of
jean
tessier
then
heaven
be
thanked
the
general
toilsome
journey
was
ended
he
had
much
to
tell
them
when
he
should
be
rested
he
removed
the
silk
hat
and
mopped
his
shining
forehead
he
must
introduce
himself
that
he
might
have
credit
with
madame
else
she
might
hardly
listen
to
his
story
for
there
had
never
been
a
tale
like
it
before
since
the
world
was
let
him
present
himself
le
général
pedro
suarez
de
moreno
count
de
tinoco
and
marquis
de
la
although
one
was
fatigued
it
refreshed
one
to
be
the
bearer
of
good
news
and
such
was
his
mission
let
madame
prepare
herself
to
hear
yes
it
would
be
proper
for
her
to
call
her
husband
that
he
might
participate
over
a
draft
of
this
same
vintage
le
général
imparted
to
them
the
secret
lapierre
laughs
and
shrugs
his
shoulders
as
he
recalls
the
scene
the
apoplectic
general
with
the
glass
of
wine
in
one
hand
waving
the
other
grandiloquently
as
he
described
the
wealth
about
to
descend
upon
them
yes
the
general
must
begin
at
the
beginning
for
it
was
a
long
story
first
as
to
himself
and
how
he
came
to
know
of
the
affair
it
had
been
on
his
return
from
the
philippines
after
the
surrender
of
manila
where
he
had
been
in
command
of
the
armies
of
spain
that
he
had
paused
for
repose
in
new
york
and
had
first
learned
of
the
tessier
inheritance
the
precise
manner
of
his
discovery
was
left
somewhat
indefinite
but
the
lapierres
were
not
particular
so
many
distinguished
persons
had
played
a
part
in
the
drama
that
the
recital
left
but
a
vague
impression
as
to
individuals
a
certain
madame
luchia
widow
of
one
roquefailaire
whom
he
had
accidentally
met
had
apparently
been
the
instrument
of
providence
in
disclosing
the
history
of
jean
tessier
to
the
general
she
herself
had
been
wronged
by
the
villains
and
knew
all
the
secrets
of
the
conspirators
but
she
had
waited
for
a
suitable
opportunity
to
speak
jean
tessier
had
died
possessed
of
properties
which
seventy
years
after
were
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
five
hundred
million
dollars
the
general
paused
for
the
effect
solemnly
nodding
his
head
at
his
astounded
auditors
in
affirmance
yes
it
was
even
so
five
hundred
million
dollars
no
more
and
no
less
then
he
once
more
took
up
the
thread
of
his
narrative
tessier
lands
originally
farms
were
occupied
by
huge
government
buildings
palaces
and
hotels
he
had
been
a
frugal
hardworking
man
of
affairs
whose
money
had
doubled
itself
year
by
year
then
had
appeared
one
emmeric
lespinasse
a
frenchman
also
from
bordeaux
who
had
plotted
to
rob
him
of
his
estate
and
the
better
to
accomplish
his
purpose
had
entered
the
employ
when
tessier
died
in
lespinasse
had
seized
his
papers
and
the
property
destroyed
his
will
dispersed
the
clerks
secretaries
notaries
and
accountants
of
the
deceased
and
quietly
got
rid
of
such
persons
as
stood
actively
in
his
way
the
great
wealth
thus
acquired
had
enabled
him
to
defy
those
who
knew
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
the
fortune
and
that
the
real
heirs
were
in
france
he
had
prospered
like
the
bay
tree
his
daughter
marie
louise
had
married
a
distinguished
english
nobleman
and
his
sons
were
now
the
richest
men
in
america
yet
they
lived
with
the
sword
of
damocles
over
their
heads
suspended
by
a
single
thread
and
the
general
had
the
knife
wherewith
to
cut
it
lespinasse
among
other
things
had
caused
the
murder
of
the
husband
of
madame
luchia
and
she
was
in
possession
of
conclusive
proofs
which
at
the
proper
moment
could
be
produced
to
convict
him
of
his
many
crimes
or
at
least
to
oust
his
sons
and
daughter
from
the
stolen
inheritance
it
was
a
weird
bizarre
nightmare
no
more
astonishing
than
the
novels
the
lapierres
had
read
america
they
understood
was
a
land
where
the
rivers
were
full
of
gold
a
country
of
bronzed
and
handsome
savages
of
birds
of
paradise
and
ruined
aztec
temples
of
vast
tobacco
fields
and
plantations
of
thousands
of
acres
of
cotton
cultivated
by
naked
slaves
while
one
lay
in
a
hammock
fanned
by
a
and
languidly
sipped
the
general
had
made
it
all
seem
very
very
real
at
the
weak
spots
he
had
gesticulated
convincingly
and
digressed
upon
his
health
then
while
the
narrative
was
fresh
and
he
might
have
had
to
answer
questions
about
it
had
he
given
his
listeners
opportunity
to
ask
them
he
had
hastily
told
of
a
visit
to
tunis
there
he
had
by
chance
encountered
marie
louise
the
daughter
of
lespinasse
living
with
her
noble
husband
in
a
handsome
oriental
palace
had
been
invited
to
dine
with
them
and
had
afterward
seized
the
occasion
while
walking
in
the
garden
with
the
lady
to
disclose
the
fact
that
he
knew
all
and
had
it
in
his
power
to
ruin
them
as
impostors
marie
louise
had
been
frightfully
angry
but
afterward
her
better
nature
had
suggested
the
return
of
the
inheritance
or
at
least
a
hundred
millions
or
so
to
the
rightful
heirs
the
general
had
left
the
palace
believing
all
would
be
well
and
had
retired
to
paris
to
await
letters
and
further
developments
but
these
had
never
come
and
he
had
discovered
that
he
had
been
deceived
it
had
been
merely
a
ruse
on
the
part
of
the
woman
and
her
husband
to
gain
time
and
now
every
step
that
he
took
was
dogged
by
spies
in
the
pay
of
the
lespinasses
who
followed
him
everywhere
but
the
right
would
triumph
he
had
sworn
to
run
the
conspiracy
to
earth
many
hours
were
consumed
in
the
telling
of
the
story
the
lapierres
were
enchanted
more
than
that
they
were
convinced
persuaded
that
they
were
heirs
to
the
richest
inheritance
in
the
world
which
comprised
most
of
the
great
american
city
of
new
york
persons
who
were
going
to
participate
in
hundred
millions
of
francs
could
afford
to
be
hospitable
le
général
stayed
to
dinner
a
list
of
the
heirs
living
in
or
near
bordeaux
was
made
out
with
the
share
of
each
in
the
inheritance
carefully
computed
madame
lapierre
was
only
fifty
million
dollars
but
still
that
was
almost
enough
to
buy
up
bordeaux
and
they
could
purchase
monségur
as
a
country
place
the
general
spoke
of
a
stable
of
automobiles
by
means
of
which
the
journey
from
bordeaux
to
the
farm
could
be
accomplished
in
the
space
of
an
hour
that
night
the
good
man
and
his
wife
scarcely
closed
their
eyes
and
the
next
day
accompanied
by
the
general
they
visited
bordeaux
and
the
neighboring
towns
and
broke
the
news
gently
to
the
other
heirs
there
was
pettit
the
veterinary
at
mormand
tessier
the
blacksmith
in
bordeaux
pelegue
and
his
wife
rozier
cazenava
and
his
son
and
others
one
branch
of
the
family
lived
in
brazil
the
joubin
frères
and
one
tessier
of
saint
bezeille
these
last
had
to
be
reached
by
post
a
most
annoyingly
slow
means
of
communication
que
those
were
busy
days
in
and
around
bordeaux
and
the
general
was
the
centre
of
attraction
what
a
splendid
figure
he
cut
in
his
tall
silk
hat
and
cane
but
they
were
all
very
careful
to
let
no
inkling
of
their
good
fortune
leak
out
for
it
might
spoil
everything
give
some
opportunity
to
the
spies
of
the
impostor
lespinasse
to
fabricate
new
chains
of
title
or
to
prepare
for
a
defense
of
the
fortune
the
little
blacksmith
being
addicted
to
white
wine
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
keep
his
head
but
even
he
managed
to
hold
his
mouth
sufficiently
shut
a
family
council
was
held
le
général
was
given
full
power
of
attorney
to
act
for
all
the
heirs
and
each
having
contributed
an
insignificant
sum
toward
his
necessary
expenses
they
waved
him
a
tremulous
as
he
stood
on
the
upper
deck
of
the
steamer
his
silk
hat
in
one
hand
and
his
cane
in
the
other
he
will
get
it
if
any
one
can
cried
the
blacksmith
enthusiastically
it
is
as
good
as
ours
already
echoed
rozier
my
friends
madame
lapierre
assured
them
a
general
of
the
armies
of
spain
and
a
chevalier
of
the
order
of
jiminez
would
die
rather
than
fail
in
his
mission
besides
she
added
her
french
blood
asserting
itself
he
is
to
get
nineteen
per
cent
of
the
inheritance
as
long
as
the
steamer
remained
in
sight
the
general
waved
encouragingly
his
hat
raised
toward
heaven
says
lapierre
with
another
shrug
as
he
lights
his
pipe
even
you
would
have
believed
him
he
would
have
deceived
the
devil
himself
up
the
road
the
wain
comes
creaking
back
again
a
crow
flaps
across
the
vineyard
laughing
scornfully
at
good
lapierre
and
you
yourself
wonder
if
such
a
thing
could
have
been
possible
on
a
rainy
afternoon
in
march
there
entered
the
writer
office
in
the
criminal
courts
building
new
york
city
a
ruddy
man
dressed
in
homespun
garments
accompanied
by
an
attractive
and
vivacious
little
woman
who
while
unable
to
speak
a
single
word
of
english
had
no
difficulty
in
making
it
obvious
that
she
had
a
story
to
tell
of
the
most
vital
importance
an
interpreter
was
soon
found
and
the
names
of
the
visitors
disclosed
the
lady
who
did
the
talking
for
both
of
them
introduced
herself
as
madame
valoie
reddon
of
bordeaux
and
her
companion
as
emile
lapierre
landowner
of
monségur
they
had
come
she
explained
from
france
to
take
possession
of
the
inheritance
tessier
she
was
a
personal
friend
of
madame
lapierre
and
as
the
tessiers
had
exhausted
all
their
money
in
paying
the
expenses
connected
with
securing
the
fortune
she
being
a
gentlewoman
had
come
to
their
assistance
and
for
the
last
few
months
had
been
financing
the
enterprise
on
a
fifteen
per
cent
basis
if
madame
lapierre
was
to
receive
ten
million
dollars
then
to
be
sure
madame
reddon
would
have
one
million
five
hundred
thouand
dollars
but
of
course
it
was
not
for
the
money
but
on
account
of
friendship
that
she
was
aiding
them
i
would
understand
that
three
years
had
elapsed
since
a
certain
distinguished
general
pedro
suarez
de
moreno
had
disclosed
to
the
lapierres
the
fact
that
madame
was
the
heiress
to
the
greatest
estate
in
america
lapierre
solemnly
nodded
confirmation
as
the
lady
proceeded
it
was
the
one
subject
talked
about
in
the
gironde
and
bordeaux
that
is
among
those
who
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
learn
anything
about
it
and
for
three
years
the
tessiers
their
wives
their
sons
wives
and
their
connections
had
been
waiting
to
receive
the
glad
tidings
that
the
conspirators
had
been
put
to
rout
and
the
rightful
heirs
reinstated
it
was
some
time
before
the
good
lady
succeeded
in
convincing
her
auditor
that
such
a
ridiculous
fraud
as
she
described
had
actually
been
perpetrated
but
there
was
lapierre
and
there
was
madame
valerie
reddon
sitting
in
the
office
as
living
witnesses
to
the
fact
what
wonderful
person
could
this
general
moreno
be
who
could
hypnotize
a
thrifty
farmer
from
the
gironde
and
a
clever
little
french
woman
from
bordeaux
into
believing
that
five
hundred
million
dollars
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
i
expressed
my
surprise
madame
reddon
shrugged
her
sloping
shoulders
well
perhaps
it
was
hard
for
to
believe
but
then
there
were
the
proofs
the
documents
the
and
most
of
all
there
was
the
general
himself
oh
if
could
see
the
general
in
his
tall
silk
hat
and
cane
i
asked
for
the
documents
madame
reddon
opened
her
bag
and
produced
a
package
of
nearly
one
hundred
letters
written
in
a
fine
spanish
hand
oh
he
had
been
a
wonderful
writer
this
gorgeous
count
de
tinoco
and
marquis
de
la
she
had
met
him
herself
when
he
had
been
in
bordeaux
madame
lapierre
had
introduced
him
to
her
and
she
had
heard
him
talk
how
beautifully
he
talked
the
stories
of
his
experiences
as
general
of
the
armies
of
spain
under
don
carlos
and
as
in
the
philippines
were
as
fascinating
as
a
romance
but
it
was
his
letters
which
had
really
led
her
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
the
undertaking
with
a
sigh
madame
valoie
untied
the
little
blue
ribbon
which
bound
up
the
pitiful
little
history
if
would
be
good
enough
to
grant
the
time
she
would
begin
at
the
beginning
here
was
his
first
letter
written
after
the
general
return
to
america
my
dear
lapierre
we
have
had
a
terrible
voyage
a
horrible
storm
broke
loose
in
endangering
all
our
lives
the
waves
like
mountains
threatened
every
instant
to
swallow
us
all
the
spectacle
was
terrifying
i
fell
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
down
into
the
hole
hurting
my
right
leg
in
the
centre
of
the
tibia
bone
the
ship
doctor
who
is
nothing
but
a
stupid
fool
left
me
helpless
almost
the
entire
day
if
ever
i
should
have
dreamt
what
would
occur
to
me
in
this
trip
not
for
all
the
gold
in
the
world
would
i
have
embarked
but
now
that
i
am
here
i
shall
not
retreat
before
any
obstacle
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
fulfillment
of
my
enterprise
and
no
matter
at
what
cost
even
at
that
of
my
life
it
is
necessary
that
i
succeed
my
pride
demands
it
those
who
are
in
the
right
shall
triumph
that
is
sure
in
the
mean
time
will
you
kindly
give
my
regards
to
madame
and
your
son
and
all
of
your
relatives
not
forgetting
your
good
old
servant
squeezing
your
hand
cordially
i
bid
you
adieu
your
devoted
pedro
de
moreno
can
you
not
see
the
waves
and
observe
him
falling
down
the
hole
asks
madame
reddon
mais
voici
une
autre
jean
lapierre
dear
as
soon
as
i
could
walk
a
little
i
began
my
research
for
the
impostors
of
the
inheritance
tessier
without
a
doubt
some
person
who
is
interested
in
the
case
has
already
advised
them
of
my
arrival
in
new
york
and
to
take
the
necessary
precautions
to
lead
me
astray
in
my
researches
already
i
have
discovered
almost
everything
i
know
even
the
house
in
which
resided
the
deceased
before
his
death
it
is
a
house
of
stories
high
which
resembles
the
church
of
saint
magdalene
in
paris
it
is
the
biggest
bank
in
new
york
i
have
visited
it
from
top
to
bottom
ascending
and
descending
in
steel
elevators
this
is
a
marvelous
palace
it
is
worth
more
than
five
million
dollars
the
house
itself
has
the
numbers
and
in
other
words
it
covers
the
ground
of
ten
other
houses
made
into
one
i
have
also
visited
six
houses
belonging
to
him
which
are
worth
millions
and
are
located
around
central
park
as
soon
as
the
brothers
lespinasse
knew
that
i
had
arrived
in
new
york
they
immediately
took
their
departure
one
for
paris
to
find
his
father
emmeric
lespinasse
the
other
to
the
city
of
tuxpan
in
mexico
to
visit
the
properties
stolen
from
the
heirs
i
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
reverend
father
van
rensselaer
father
superior
of
the
jesuits
and
have
offered
him
two
millions
for
his
poor
in
recompense
for
his
aid
to
recover
and
to
enter
into
possession
of
the
inheritance
he
takes
great
pains
and
is
my
veritable
guide
and
confidant
i
have
visited
central
park
also
a
property
of
the
deceased
this
property
alone
is
worth
more
than
twenty
million
dollars
i
have
great
confidence
in
my
success
and
i
am
almost
sure
to
reach
the
goal
if
you
are
the
heirs
for
here
there
is
a
by
all
the
devils
the
wound
of
my
leg
has
much
improved
the
consequences
which
i
feared
have
disappeared
and
i
expect
soon
my
complete
convalescence
but
the
devil
has
bestowed
upon
me
a
toothache
which
makes
me
almost
crazy
with
pain
i
shall
leave
nevertheless
to
begin
my
campaign
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
give
my
regards
to
your
wife
and
son
and
to
our
old
friend
etc
pedro
de
moreno
may
the
devil
bestow
upon
him
five
hundred
million
toothaches
exclaims
lapierre
for
the
first
time
showing
any
sign
of
animation
the
other
letters
were
read
in
their
order
interspersed
with
madame
reddon
explanations
of
their
effect
upon
the
heirs
in
france
his
description
of
the
elevators
of
steel
and
of
the
house
that
covered
an
entire
block
had
caused
a
veritable
sensation
alas
those
wonders
are
still
wonders
to
them
and
they
still
i
fancy
more
than
half
believe
in
them
the
letters
are
lying
before
me
now
astonishing
emanations
totally
ridiculous
to
a
prosaic
american
but
calculated
to
convince
and
stimulate
the
imagination
of
a
the
general
in
glowing
terms
paints
his
efforts
to
run
down
the
lespinasse
conspirators
although
suffering
horribly
from
his
fractured
tibia
when
he
fell
into
the
hole
and
from
other
dire
ills
he
has
not
taken
the
slightest
rest
he
has
been
everywhere
new
orleans
florida
to
the
city
of
coney
island
to
corner
the
villains
who
flee
in
all
directions
the
daughter
marie
louise
through
whom
the
general
expects
to
secure
a
compromise
has
left
for
new
orleans
wonderful
coincidence
he
writes
they
were
all
living
quietly
and
i
believe
had
no
intention
whatever
to
travel
and
two
days
after
my
arrival
in
new
york
they
all
disappeared
the
most
suspicious
of
it
all
is
that
the
banker
his
wife
and
children
had
left
for
coney
island
for
the
summer
and
to
spend
their
holidays
and
certainly
they
disappeared
without
saying
to
their
intimate
friends
i
have
the
whole
history
of
tessier
life
and
how
he
made
his
fortune
there
is
a
family
for
the
use
of
whom
we
must
give
at
least
a
million
for
the
fortune
of
tessier
was
not
his
alone
he
had
a
companion
who
shared
his
troubles
and
his
work
according
to
the
will
they
were
to
inherit
one
from
the
other
the
companion
died
and
tessier
inherited
everything
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
of
your
trip
to
new
york
that
might
make
noise
and
perhaps
delay
my
negotiations
then
follows
the
list
of
properties
embraced
in
the

do
you
blame
us
asks
madame
valoie
as
i
listen
as
politely
as
possible
to
this
arabian
nights
dream
of
riches
the
letters
continue
the
general
is
surrounded
by
enemies
of
which
the
worst
are
french
and
he
is
forced
continually
to
change
his
residence
in
order
to
escape
their
machinations
but
all
this
takes
money
how
can
he
go
to
tuxpan
or
to
the
city
of
coney
island
you
can
not
know
nor
imagine
the
expense
which
i
have
had
to
discover
that
which
i
have
discovered
i
can
not
live
here
like
a
miser
for
the
part
i
represent
demands
much
of
me
every
moment
i
change
my
residence
and
that
costs
money
he
adds
a
little
touch
of
detail
i
must
always
be
dressed
properly
and
laundry
is
very
dear
here
a
shirt
costs
cents
to
wash
and
there
are
other
necessary
expenses
you
have
forgotten
to
tell
me
if
you
have
received
the
album
of
views
of
new
york
in
which
i
have
indicated
the
properties
of
the
deceased
i
squeeze
your
hand
yes
and
our
purses
too
adds
madame
valoie
would
care
to
see
the
album
of
the
tessier
properties
yes
lapierre
kindly
show
the
gentleman
lapierre
unbuttons
his
homespun
coat
and
produces
a
cheap
blank
book
in
which
are
pasted
small
photographs
and
woodcuts
of
various
new
york
buildings
it
is
hard
not
to
smile
will
see
continues
madame
valoie
that
the
dream
had
something
substantial
about
it
when
we
saw
these
pictures
in
bordeaux
we
were
on
the
point
of
giving
up
in
despair
but
the
pictures
convinced
us
that
it
was
all
true
moreover
just
at
that
time
the
general
intimated
that
unless
he
had
more
money
he
might
yield
to
the
efforts
of
the
lespinasse
family
to
buy
him
off
madame
valoie
points
vindictively
to
a
certain
paragraph
in
one
of
the
letters
of
course
they
are
convinced
that
i
am
not
for
sale
not
for
anything
to
my
regret
my
very
great
regret
i
shall
be
forced
to
capitulate
if
you
do
not
come
to
my
aid
and
that
quickly
for
i
repeat
to
you
that
my
funds
are
all
gone
and
here
is
his
bill
continues
madame
valoie
producing
a
folded
document
composed
of
countless
sheets
of
very
thin
paper
bound
together
at
the
edges
by
strips
of
heavier
material
this
when
unfolded
stretches
entirely
across
the
room
and
is
seen
to
be
composed
of
hundreds
of
typewritten
items
of
which
the
following
may
serve

to

that
he
might
well
say
interpolates
lapierre
he
succeed
i
rapidly
glanced
over
the
remaining
letters
the
general
seems
always
to
be
upon
the
verge
of
compelling
a
compromise
i
have
already
prepared
my
net
and
the
meshes
are
tightly
drawn
so
that
the
fish
will
not
be
able
to
escape
for
an
office
like
this
one
needs
money
money
to
go
quickly
from
one
place
to
another
prosecute
the
usurpers
not
allow
them
an
instant
rest
if
they
go
to
some
city
run
after
them
at
once
tire
them
with
my
presence
and
constantly
harass
them
and
by
this
means
compel
them
to
hasten
a
compromise
the
general
is
meeting
with
superhuman
obstacles
in
addition
to
his
enemies
he
suffers
all
sorts
of
terrible
bodily
afflictions
whenever
the
remittances
from
the
lapierres
do
not
arrive
the
difficulties
and
diseases
increase
at
last
however
after
an
interval
of
two
years
things
took
a
turn
for
the
better
a
confidential
representative
of
the
conspirators
one
arrived
to
make
a
bona
fide
offer
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
million
dollars
in
settlement
of
the
case
the
general
writes
at
great
length
as
to
exactly
in
what
proportion
the
money
should
be
divided
among
the
heirs
the
thing
is
so
near
a
culmination
that
he
is
greatly
exercised
over
his
shabby
appearance
i
am
without
a
son
and
too
badly
dressed
to
go
before
the
banker
in
the
very
likely
case
of
his
arrival
here
send
me
my
baggage
at
once
with
the
first
steamer
and
mark
each
piece
fragile
this
is
all
my
regards
to
madame
lapierre
and
your
son
i
am
cordially
yours
squeezing
your
hand
pedro
de
moreno
but
the
lapierres
and
tessiers
while
not
for
an
instant
distrusting
the
honesty
of
the
general
had
become
extremely
weary
of
sending
him
money
each
heir
felt
that
he
had
contributed
enough
toward
the
general
expenses
and
invitations
even
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
millions
within
easy
reach
did
not
prompt
immediate
response
about
the
same
time
an
extraordinary
messenger
arrived
at
the
lapierre
farm
purporting
to
come
from
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
and
instructing
lapierre
to
repair
immediately
to
paris
the
messenger
explained
that
the
presence
of
lapierre
was
desired
at
the
ministry
in
connection
with
some
investigation
then
in
progress
into
the
affairs
of
one
jean
tessier
then
the
messenger
departed
as
mysteriously
as
he
had
arrived
good
lapierre
was
highly
excited
here
was
indubitable
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
general
assertions
but
just
as
the
latter
had
intended
perhaps
the
worthy
farmer
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
probably
the
messenger
from
paris
had
been
sent
by
the
conspirators
at
the
last
moment
wrote
lapierre
to
moreno
i
received
from
paris
a
letter
commanding
me
to
go
to
the
ministry
and
at
the
same
time
a
telegram
recommending
that
i
leave
at
once
i
shall
write
you
from
paris
all
that
i
learn
to
your
interest
if
this
letter
should
not
reach
you
sealed
in
red
wax
with
small
indentations
made
with
a
sewing
thimble
and
my
initials
which
i
always
sign
it
is
that
our
correspondence
is
seized
and
read
events
followed
in
rapid
succession
lapierre
the
tessiers
including
the
little
blacksmith
became
almost
hysterical
with
excitement
a
gentleman
by
name
francis
delas
called
upon
lapierre
and
offered
him
million
dollars
spot
cash
for
his
wife
share
in
the
tessier
inheritance
this
person
also
claimed
that
he
had
a
power
of
attorney
from
all
the
other
heirs
with
the
exception
of
pettit
and
rozier
and
asserted
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
embarking
for
new
york
in
their
interest
he
urged
lapierre
to
substitute
him
for
moreno
but
lapierre
now
convinced
that
everything
was
as
the
general
had
claimed
it
to
be
indignantly
rejected
any
such
proposition
aimed
at
his
old
friend
and
sent
francis
delas
packing
about
his
business
this
is
what
my
answer
has
been
to
him
we
have
already
an
agent
with
whom
we
can
only
have
cause
to
be
satisfied
so
that
your
services
are
not
acceptable
or
needed
he
left
me
most
dissatisfied
and
scolding
the
sending
of
this
confederate
on
the
part
of
the
wily
general
had
precisely
the
effect
hoped
for
lapierre
and
his
friends
were
now
convinced
that
the
inheritance
tessier
was
a
reality
and
that
powerful
personages
were
not
only
exerting
their
influence
to
prevent
the
rightful
heirs
from
obtaining
their
property
but
had
also
in
some
way
secured
the
cooperation
of
government
officials
it
was
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
worthy
landowner
accompanied
by
madame
reddon
had
better
proceed
at
once
to
the
scene
of
operations
and
unite
with
the
general
in
their
common
purpose
once
on
the
ground
lapierre
could
assume
direction
of
his
own
campaign
lapierre
and
madame
reddon
accordingly
sailed
for
america
and
arrived
in
new
york
on
the
fourth
of
december
where
they
were
met
on
the
dock
by
the
general
who
freshly
barbered
and
with
a
rose
in
his
buttonhole
invited
them
as
soon
as
they
had
recovered
from
the
fatigue
of
landing
to
make
a
personal
inspection
of
their
properties
these
heirs
to
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
were
conducted
by
the
marquis
de
la
and
count
de
tinoco
to
the
battery
where
he
gallantly
seated
them
in
an
electric
surface
car
and
proceeded
to
show
them
the
inheritance
he
pointed
out
successively
number
broadway
the
flatiron
building
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
and
the
holland
house
the
the
vanderbilt
mansion
at
street
and
fifth
avenue
the
hotel
savoy
and
the
hotel
netherland
incidentally
taking
a
trip
to
the
ferry
station
at
east
street
and
to
bellevue
hospital
a
public
omnibus
conveyed
them
around
central
park
also
their
own
and
in
spite
of
the
cold
weather
the
general
insisted
on
showing
them
the
tessier
mansion
and
estate
at
fort
george
visible
from
the
washington
bridge
a
beautiful
property
in
the
centre
of
a
wood
returning
he
took
them
to
the
museum
of
natural
history
and
to
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art
which
contained
tessier
collections
having
thus
given
them
a
view
of
the
promised
land
the
general
escorted
them
to
his
apartments
and
allowed
them
to
see
the
ark
of
the
covenant
in
the
shape
of
a
somewhat
dilapidated
leather
trunk
which
contained
a
paper
alleged
to
be
the
will
of
jean
tessier
made
in
bellevue
hospital
one
of
his
possessions
and
unlawfully
seized
by
the
lespinasse
family
it
was
only
moreno
alleged
through
the
powerful
influence
of
the
jesuits
that
he
had
been
able
to
secure
and
keep
a
copy
of
this
will
although
the
marquis
de
la
must
have
known
that
his
days
were
numbered
he
was
as
gay
and
as
entertaining
as
ever
then
suddenly
the
scales
began
to
fall
from
madame
reddon
eyes
the
promised
meeting
with
marie
louise
lespinasse
and
her
mysterious
representative
was
constantly
adjourned
the
police
agents
whom
it
had
been
so
necessary
to
entertain
and
invite
to
saloons
and
cafés
were
strangely
absent
and
so
were
the
counsellors
jesuit
fathers
bankers
and
others
who
had
crowded
the
general
antechambers
a
slatternly
hibernian
woman
appeared
claiming
the
hero
as
her
husband
his
landlady
caused
him
to
be
evicted
from
her
premises
and
his
trunk
containing
the
famous
was
thrown
into
the
street
where
it
lay
until
the
general
himself
placing
it
upon
his
princely
shoulders
bore
it
to
a
and
now
said
little
madame
reddon
raising
her
hands
and
clasping
them
entreatingly
before
her
we
have
come
to
seek
vengeance
upon
this
this
he
has
taken
our
money
and
made
fools
of
us
surely
you
will
give
us
justice
yes
echoed
lapierre
stubbornly
and
the
money
was
my
own
money
which
i
had
made
from
the
products
of
my
farming
a
month
later
don
pedro
suarez
de
moreno
count
de
tinoco
marquis
de
la
and
of
the
royal
armies
of
the
philippines
and
of
spain
sat
at
the
bar
of
the
general
sessions
twirling
his
mustache
and
uttering
loud
snorts
of
contempt
while
lapierre
and
madame
reddon
told
their
story
to
an
almost
incredulous
yet
sympathetic
jury
but
the
real
trial
began
only
when
he
arose
to
take
the
witness
chair
in
his
own
behalf
apparently
racked
with
pain
and
laboring
under
the
most
frightful
physical
infirmities
the
general
through
an
interpreter
introduced
himself
to
the
jury
by
all
his
titles
asserting
that
he
had
inherited
his
patents
of
nobility
from
the
prince
of
arras
from
whom
he
was
descended
and
that
he
was
in
very
truth
of
the
armies
of
the
king
of
spain
general
secretary
of
war
and
custodian
of
the
royal
seal
he
admitted
telling
the
lapierres
that
they
were
the
heirs
of
five
hundred
million
dollars
but
he
had
himself
honestly
believed
it
when
he
and
the
rest
of
them
had
discovered
their
common
error
they
had
turned
upon
him
and
were
now
hounding
him
out
of
revenge
the
courtly
general
was
as
as
ever
as
he
addressed
the
jury
of
tradesmen
before
him
as
what
he
must
have
regarded
them
what
a
position
for
the
count
de
tinoco
then
two
officers
entered
the
courtroom
bearing
the
famous
trunk
of
the
general
between
them
the
top
tray
proved
to
contain
thousands
of
railroad
tickets
the
prosecutor
requested
the
defendant
to
explain
their
possession
ah
exclaimed
moreno
twirling
his
mustaches
when
i
was
general
under
my
king
don
carlos
in
the
seven
years
war
of
and
also
in
catalonia
in
i
issued
these
tickets
to
wounded
soldiers
for
their
return
home
at
the
boundaries
the
spanish
tickets
were
exchanged
for
french
tickets
he
looked
as
if
he
really
meant
it
then
the
prosecutor
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
most
of
them
bore
the
date
of
and
were
printed
in
french
not
in
spanish
the
prisoner
seemed
greatly
surprised
and
muttered
under
his
breath
vaguely
about
plots
and
conspiracies
then
he
suddenly
remembered
that
the
tickets
were
a
collection
made
by
his
little
son
beneath
the
tickets
were
found
sheaves
of
blank
orders
of
nobility
and
blank
commissions
in
the
army
of
spain
bearing
what
appeared
to
be
the
royal
seal
these
the
general
asserted
that
he
had
the
right
to
confer
by
proxy
for
his
king
don
carlos
hundreds
of
other
documents
bearing
various
arms
and
crests
lay
interspersed
among
them
the
prisoner
drew
himself
up
magnificently
i
was
the
general
secretary
of
war
of
my
king
said
he
when
i
had
to
give
orders
to
the
generals
under
me
of
whom
i
was
the
chief
i
had
the
right
to
put
thereon
the
royal
imprint
of
don
carlos
i
was
given
all
the
papers
incident
to
the
granting
of
orders
and
grades
in
the
army
and
i
had
the
seal
of
the
king
the
seal
of
the
royal
king
but
unfortunately
for
the
prisoner
the
seals
upon
the
papers
turned
out
to
be
the
legitimate
arms
of
spain
and
not
those
of
don
carlos
and
as
a
finale
he
ingenuously
identified
the
seal
of
the
mayor
of
madrid
as
that
of
his
royal
king
next
came
a
selection
of
letters
of
nobility
sealed
and
signed
in
the
name
of
pope
leo
the
thirteenth
these
he
asserted
must
have
been
placed
there
by
his
enemies
i
am
a
soldier
and
a
general
of
honor
and
i
never
did
any
such
trafficking
he
cried
grandly
when
charged
with
selling
bogus
patents
of
nobility
he
explained
some
of
his
correspondence
with
the
lapierres
and
his
famous
bill
for
twelve
thousand
dollars
by
saying
that
when
he
found
out
that
the
inheritance
tessier
did
not
exist
he
had
conceived
the
idea
of
making
a
novel
of
the
story
a
fantastic
history
to
be
published
in
four
languages
simultaneously
and
asserted
solemnly
that
he
had
intended
printing
the
whole
sixteen
feet
of
bill
as
part
of
the
romance
then
to
the
undisguised
horror
of
the
unfortunate
general
at
a
summons
from
the
prosecutor
an
elderly
french
woman
arose
in
the
audience
and
came
to
the
bar
the
general
turned
first
pale
then
purple
he
hotly
denied
that
he
had
married
this
lady
in
france
years
ago
name
of
a
name
he
had
known
her
yes
certainly
but
she
was
no
wife
of
his
she
had
been
only
his
servant
the
other
lady
the
hibernian
was
his
only
wife
but
the
chickens
had
begun
to
come
home
to
roost
the
pointed
mustaches
drooped
with
an
unmistakable
look
of
dejection
and
as
he
marched
back
to
his
seat
his
shoulders
no
longer
had
the
air
of
military
distinction
that
one
would
expect
in
a
general
of
a
royal
king
his
head
sank
on
his
chest
as
his
deserted
wife
took
the
stand
against
him
the
wife
whom
he
had
imagined
he
would
never
see
again
any
one
could
have
seen
that
elizabeth
de
moreno
was
a
good
woman
her
father
name
she
said
was
nichaud
and
she
had
first
met
the
prisoner
years
ago
in
the
village
of
dalk
in
the
department
of
the
tarne
where
in
he
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced
for
stealing
bed
linen
from
the
hôtel
kassam
she
had
remained
faithful
to
him
in
spite
of
his
disgrace
and
had
visited
him
daily
in
prison
bringing
him
milk
and
tobacco
on
his
liberation
she
had
married
him
and
they
had
gone
to
live
in
bordeaux
for
years
they
had
lived
in
comfort
and
she
had
borne
him
eight
children
he
had
never
been
to
any
war
and
was
neither
a
general
nor
so
far
as
she
had
known
a
friend
of
don
carlos
she
had
supposed
that
her
husband
held
some
position
in
connection
with
the
inspection
of
railroads
but
in
it
had
come
out
that
he
was
in
the
business
of
selling
counterfeit
railroad
tickets
and
had
employed
a
printer
named
paul
casignol
to
print
great
numbers
of
tickets
for
the
purpose
of
selling
them
to
ignorant
soldiers
and
artisans
moreno
had
fled
to
america
she
had
then
discovered
that
he
had
also
made
a
practice
of
checking
worthless
baggage
it
and
then
presenting
claims
therefor
against
the
railroad
companies
she
had
been
left
without
a
sou
and
the
rascal
had
taken
everything
she
had
away
with
him
including
even
the
locket
containing
the
hair
of
her
children
by
the
time
she
had
finished
her
story
moreno
courage
had
deserted
him
the
jury
without
hesitation
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
judge
then
and
there
sentenced
the
prisoner
to
a
term
at
hard
labor
in
state
prison
grunts
lapierre
as
the
crow
with
a
final
caw
of
contempt
alights
in
a

i
do
blame
the
bird
for
laughing
at
me
but
after
all
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of

one
to
be
blamed
that

fooled
we

iii
the
lost
stradivarius
in
the
year
jean
bott
a
native
of
hesse
cassel
germany
emigrated
with
his
wife
matilda
to
this
country
bringing
with
him
a
celebrated
violin
known
as
the
duke
of
cambridge
stradivarius
which
he
had
purchased
in
for
about
three
thousand
thalers
a
sum
representing
practically
the
savings
of
a
lifetime
bott
had
been
leader
of
a
small
orchestra
in
saxe
meiningen
as
early
as
and
was
well
advanced
in
years
before
he
determined
to
seek
his
fortune
in
america
his
wife
was
an
elderly
woman
and
they
had
no
offspring
this
violin
my
husband
and
myself
made
up
the
family
i
loved
it
like
a
child
she
testified
at
the
trial
so
also
did
bott
the
old
musician
love
his
instrument
and
no
hand
but
his
own
was
ever
permitted
to
lift
it
from
its
case
or
dust
its
surface
whatever
may
have
been
its
owner
genius
he
prospered
little
in
the
new
world
and
although
he
labored
conscientiously
at
his
profession
the
year
found
him
still
giving
lessons
upon
the
violin
to
only
half
a
dozen
pupils
and
living
in
two
rooms
at
west
street
but
bott
having
the
soul
of
a
true
musician
cared
but
little
for
money
and
was
happy
enough
so
long
as
he
could
smoke
his
old
meerschaum
pipe
and
draw
the
bow
across
the
cherished
violin
held
lovingly
to
his
cheek
then
hard
times
came
at
the
door
the
meagre
account
in
the
grew
smaller
and
smaller
the
landlord
the
doctor
and
the
grocer
had
to
be
paid
one
night
bott
laid
down
his
pipe
and
taking
his
wife
wrinkled
hand
in
his
said
gently
matilda
there
is
nothing
else
we
must
sell
our
violin
even
so
she
answered
turning
away
her
face
that
her
husband
might
not
see
the
tears
as
god
wills
the
next
day
the
duke
of
cambridge
stradivarius
was
offered
for
sale
by
victor
flechter
a
friend
of
bott
who
was
a
dealer
in
musical
instruments
at
union
square
it
so
happened
that
nicolini
the
husband
of
adelina
patti
was
ambitious
to
own
a
genuine
stradivarius
and
had
been
looking
for
one
for
a
long
time
and
although
he
was
but
an
indifferent
player
he
had
in
default
of
skill
to
perform
the
money
to
buy
the
matter
was
easily
adjusted
by
flechter
and
nicolini
drew
his
check
for
the
sum
specified
which
properly
certified
was
tendered
to
bott
but
bott
had
never
seen
a
certified
check
and
was
unaccustomed
to
the
ways
of
business
if
i
part
with
my
violin
i
must
have
real
money
money
that
i
can
feel
money
that
i
can
count
it
was
that
kind
of
money
that
i
paid
for
my
violin
said
he
doggedly
nicolini
in
a
rage
believing
himself
insulted
tore
the
check
to
bits
and
declared
the
transaction
at
an
end
now
the
price
agreed
upon
for
the
violin
had
been
hundred
dollars
of
which
flechter
was
to
receive
five
hundred
dollars
as
his
commission
and
when
through
old
professor
bott
stubbornness
the
sale
fell
through
the
dealer
was
naturally
very
angry
out
of
this
incident
grew
the
case
against
flechter
the
old
musician
was
accustomed
to
leave
his
treasured
instrument
in
the
lowest
drawer
of
his
bureau
at
the
he
always
removed
it
before
his
pupils
arrived
and
never
put
it
back
until
their
departure
thus
insuring
the
secrecy
of
its
and
only
his
wife
his
mollenhauer
a
friend
and
klopton
a
prospective
purchaser
knew
where
it
lay
on
the
morning
of
march
not
long
after
the
nicolini
incident
bott
gave
a
single
lesson
to
a
pupil
at
the
and
after
his
midday
meal
set
out
with
his
wife
for
hoboken
to
visit
a
friend
the
violin
was
left
in
its
customary
place
it
was
dark
when
they
returned
and
after
throwing
off
his
coat
and
lighting
the
gas
the
old
man
hastened
to
make
sure
that
his
precious
violin
was
safe
when
he
pulled
out
the
drawer
it
was
empty
the
stradivarius
was
gone
with
its
leather
case
its
two
bows
and
its
wooden
box
half
distracted
the
musician
and
his
wife
searched
everywhere
in
the
room
in
closets
under
beds
even
behind
the
curtains
before
they
could
bring
themselves
to
admit
that
the
violin
had
in
fact
disappeared
frantically
bott
called
for
ellen
the
servant
girl
yes
there
had
been
a
caller
a
young
man
with
dark
hair
and
a
small
dark
mustache
at
about
five
he
had
waited
about
half
an
hour
and
then
had
said
that
he
guessed
he
would
go
she
had
not
noticed
that
he
took
anything
away
with
him
in
his
despair
the
old
man
turned
to
his
old
friend
flechter
and
the
next
day
the
dealer
came
to
express
his
sympathy
he
urged
bott
to
notify
the
police
of
the
theft
but
the
old
man
was
prostrated
with
grief
and
it
was
the
wife
who
with
ellen
clancy
finally
accompanied
flechter
to
police
headquarters
the
police
had
no
idea
who
had
taken
the
old
fellow
fiddle
and
did
not
particularly
care
anyway
later
they
cared
a
good
deal
bott
now
began
an
endless
and
almost
hopeless
search
for
his
beloved
instrument
visiting
every
place
where
violins
were
sold
every
pawnshop
and
store
again
and
again
until
the
proprietors
began
to
think
the
old
man
must
be
crazy
sometimes
flechter
went
with
him
once
the
two
travelled
all
the
way
over
to
new
jersey
but
the
scent
proved
to
be
a
false
one
bott
grew
thinner
and
older
week
by
week
almost
day
by
day
when
the
professor
did
not
feel
equal
to
going
outdoors
bott
went
for
him
and
on
these
occasions
often
called
at
store
to
report
progress
ask
his
advice
and
secure
his
encouragement
one
day
during
one
of
these
visits
in
the
july
following
the
loss
of
the
violin
flechter
handed
bott
a
sheet
of
paper
saying
i
have
written
something
down
here
if
you
have
that
printed
and
put
a
reward
to
it
you
will
get
your
violin
back
the
wording
partly
printed
and
partly
written
in
script
ran
as
follows
violin
lost
reward
no
questions
asked
for
return
of
instrument
taken
from
residence
of
jean
bott
march
absolute
safety
and
secrecy
guaranteed
victor
flechter
no
union
square
violin
maker
and
dealer
bott
thanked
him
and
took
the
notice
away
with
her
but
its
publication
had
no
result
the
old
professor
began
to
fail
he
no
longer
had
an
instrument
upon
which
to
teach
his
pupils
and
those
he
could
avail
himself
of
seemed
harsh
and
discordant
he
had
no
appetite
and
even
found
no
solace
in
his
pipe
almost
penniless
they
were
forced
to
give
up
their
lodgings
and
move
to
hoboken
bott
still
kept
up
the
search
but
the
professor
could
no
longer
tramp
the
streets
looking
for
his
violin
he
sat
silent
in
his
room
slowly
surely
dying
of
a
broken
heart
in
course
of
time
some
one
advised
bott
to
lay
her
case
before
the
district
attorney
and
accordingly
during
the
summer
she
visited
the
criminal
courts
building
and
told
her
story
to
colonel
allen
one
of
the
assistants
who
became
greatly
interested
the
overwrought
old
woman
had
begun
to
suspect
everybody
and
even
to
accuse
her
husband
friend
flechter
of
a
lack
of
any
real
interest
she
thought
he
ought
to
be
able
to
find
the
violin
if
he
really
made
the
effort
allen
began
to
take
notice
the
sleuth
in
him
pricked
up
its
ears
why
sure
certainly
flechter
was
the
one
man
who
knew
what
bott
violin
was
really
worth
the
one
man
who
could
sell
it
to
advantage
and
he
had
been
done
out
of
five
hundred
dollars
by
the
old
musician
stupidity
allen
thought
he
take
a
look
into
the
thing
now
there
lived
in
the
same
with
allen
a
friend
of
his
named
harry
durden
and
to
durden
allen
recounted
the
story
of
the
lost
violin
and
voiced
his
suspicions
of
flechter
durden
entered
enthusiastically
into
the
case
volunteering
to
play
the
part
of
an
amateur
detective
accordingly
durden
accompanied
by
a
central
office
man
named
baird
visited
flechter
place
of
business
and
the
two
represented
themselves
as
connoisseurs
in
violins
and
anxious
to
procure
a
genuine
strad
for
a
certain
wright
in
paul
flechter
expressed
entire
confidence
in
his
ability
to
procure
one
and
did
almost
succeed
in
purchasing
for
them
the
jupiter
strad
all
this
took
time
and
at
last
on
april
poor
old
bott
died
in
his
in
hoboken
after
the
funeral
the
widow
settled
up
her
affairs
changing
her
boarding
place
temporarily
and
having
no
ties
in
this
country
determined
to
return
to
end
her
days
in
the
fatherland
on
may
she
wrote
to
flechter
who
had
lost
all
track
of
her
that
her
husband
had
died
that
she
had
moved
to
river
street
hoboken
and
that
she
thought
seriously
of
going
back
to
germany
two
days
later
flechter
wrote
the
following
letter
to
the
central
office
man
who
had
given
his
name
as
southan
an
employe
of
the
alleged
wright
southan
care
of
durden
write
to
inform
you
that
i
have
a
genuine
strad
to
offer
you
and
would
like
to
see
you
at
your
earliest
convenience
very
respectfully
yours
victor
flechter
when
allen
saw
this
letter
it
seemed
to
him
absolutely
to
confirm
his
suspicions
now
that
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
had
been
authoritatively
able
to
identify
the
duke
of
cambridge
stradivarius
was
dead
flechter
was
offering
one
for
sale
then
occurred
the
strangest
thing
of
all
on
may
five
days
after
flechter
letter
to
southan
bott
received
the
following
extraordinary
epistle
like
the
notice
given
her
by
flechter
in
his
office
it
was
partly
written
in
printed
capitals
and
partly
in
script
to
bott
river
street
hoboken
j
i
wish
to
inform
you
that
the
violin
taken
from
your
house
some
time
ago
will
be
returned
if
you
are
willing
to
abide
by
agreements
that
will
be
made
between
you
and
i
later
on
it
was
my
intention
first
to
dispose
of
it
but
on
account
of
its
great
value
and
the
danger
it
would
place
me
in
by
offering
for
sale
being
a
violin
maker
and
dealer
and
not
being
able
to
sell
with
safety
for
such
a
large
sum
of
money
i
concluded
to
wait
i
have
now
thought
the
matter
over
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
little
money
is
better
than
none
and
if
you
are
anxious
for
the
return
of
the
violin
and
willing
to
pay
a
sum
of
money
small
compared
with
the
value
of
the
violin
i
think
we
can
make
a
deal
you
can
put
a
personal
in
the
new
york
sun
saying
i
am
willing
to
give
a
sum
of
money
for
the
return
of
the
violin
no
questions
asked
bott
when
i
see
your
personal
in
the
sun
i
will
let
you
know
how
the
exchange
can
be
made
cave
dweller
this
letter
appeared
to
be
written
in
a
somewhat
similar
hand
to
that
which
penned
the
offer
of
the
reward
which
according
to
bott
was
flechter
by
this
time
the
widow
and
allen
were
in
close
communication
the
cave
dweller
letter
could
it
be
shown
to
be
in
flechter
penmanship
seemed
to
fix
the
crime
on
the
violin
dealer
flechter
store
is
two
flights
up

looks
out
into
union
square
before
the
window
hangs
a
large
gilded
fiddle
and
the
walls
are
decorated
with
pictures
of
famous
musicians
in
the
rear
is
a
safe
where
the
more
valuable
instruments
are
kept
in
the
front
sits
flechter
himself
a
stoutish
man
of
middle
height
with
white
hair
and
mustache
but
on
june
flechter
was
out
when
durden
and
baird
called
and
only
his
clerk
and
were
on
hand
durden
wished
he
said
to
see
the
genuine
strad
about
which
flechter
had
written
him
the
boy
went
to
the
safe
and
brought
back
a
violin
in
a
red
silk
bag
inside
was
inscribed
antonius
stradivarius
cremonis
fecit
anno
domini
the
figures
were
printed
and
the
written
in
ink
durden
examined
it
for
some
fifteen
minutes
and
noted
certain
markings
upon
it
on
june
they
called
again
found
flechter
in
and
asked
to
see
the
violin
this
time
the
dealer
look
it
himself
from
the
safe
and
at
their
request
carried
it
to
gramercy
park
where
durden
said
he
desired
some
experts
to
pass
upon
its
genuineness
on
the
way
over
flechter
guaranteed
it
to
be
a
genuine
and
said
it
belonged
to
a
retired
merchant
named
rossman
who
would
expect
to
get
four
thousand
dollars
for
it
he
himself
would
want
five
hundred
dollars
and
durden
should
have
five
hundred
dollars
so
that
they
must
not
take
less
than
five
thousand
dollars
once
at
allen
flechter
played
upon
the
violin
for
durden
and
the
supposed
southan
and
then
the
former
asked
to
be
allowed
to
take
the
instrument
to
a
rear
room
and
show
it
to
a
friend
here
bott
positively
identified
the
violin
as
that
of
her
husband
clasping
it
to
her
bosom
like
a
child
this
was
enough
for
durden
who
gave
the
instrument
back
to
flechter
and
caused
his
arrest
as
he
was
passing
out
of
the
front
gate
the
insulted
dealer
stormed
and
raged
but
the
car
of
juggernaut
had
started
upon
its
course
and
that
night
flechter
was
lodged
in
the
city
prison
next
morning
he
was
brought
before
magistrate
flammer
in
the
jefferson
market
police
court
and
the
violin
was
taken
out
of
its
case
which
the
police
had
sealed
at
this
the
first
hearing
in
this
extraordinary
case
bott
of
course
identified
the
violin
positively
as
the
duke
of
cambridge
and
several
other
persons
testified
that
in
substance
it
was
celebrated
violin
but
for
the
defendant
a
number
of
violin
makers
swore
that
it
was
not
the
bott
violin
at
all
and
more
that
it
was
not
even
a
stradivarius
one
of
them
john
eller
to
whom
it
will
be
necessary
to
revert
later
made
oath
that
the
violin
was
stolen
from
him
and
brought
to
flechter
by
the
thief
on
this
testimony
the
magistrate
naturally
decided
that
the
identity
of
the
instrument
had
not
been
established
and
ordered
that
flechter
be
discharged
and
the
violin
returned
to
him
ordinarily
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
case
but
allen
had
his
own
private
views
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
dealer
and
on
august
the
grand
jury
filed
an
indictment
against
flechter
accusing
him
of
feloniously
receiving
stolen
property
the
violin
knowing
it
to
have
been
stolen
great
was
flechter
anger
and
chagrin
but
he
promptly
gave
bail
and
employed
the
ablest
counsel
he
could
afford
now
began
the
second
act
of
this
tragedy
of
errors
the
case
was
called
for
trial
with
the
people
interests
in
the
hands
of
james
osborne
just
advancing
into
the
limelight
as
a
resourceful
and
relentless
prosecutor
i
say
the
case
but
perhaps
case
would
be
a
more
fitting
title
for
the
defense
arthur
palmer
held
the
fort
directing
his
fire
upon
osborne
and
losing
no
advantage
inadvertently
given
him
the
noise
of
the
conflict
filled
the
court
house
and
drowned
the
uproar
on
broadway
nightly
and
each
morning
the
daily
press
gave
columns
to
the
proceedings
every
time
the
judge
coughed
the
important
fact
was
given
due
prominence
and
every
gibe
of
counsel
carried
behind
it
its
insignia
of
recognition
it
was
one
of
those
first
great
battles
in
which
the
professional
value
of
compressed
air
as
an
explosive
force
and
small
pica
type
as
projectiles
was
demonstrated
it
was
a
combat
of
wind
and
lead
an
endurance
contest
during
which
the
jury
slept
fitfully
for
three
long
weeks
two
things
the
prosecution
claimed
proved
flechter
guilt
first
the
fact
that
the
violin
found
in
his
possession
was
the
duke
of
cambridge
second
that
the
letter
was
in
the
same
handwriting
as
flechter
notice
of
reward
of
course
the
latter
proposition
carried
with
it
the
necessity
of
proving
in
the
first
place
that
the
notice
itself
was
in
penmanship
flechter
through
his
counsel
said
it
was
and
that
he
had
never
told
mrs
bott
that
it
was
he
claimed
that
his
john
abraham
had
written
it
bott
he
alleged
was
an
old
lady
and
was
mistaken
in
her
testimony
when
she
swore
that
he
had
said
i
have
written
down
something
he
had
not
said
so
abraham
corroborated
him
he
had
written
it
himself
sitting
in
an
armchair
all
but
the
words
west
street
which
had
been
put
in
by
a
certain
jopling
who
had
been
present
jopling
swore
that
that
was
so
too
but
on
it
developed
that
abraham
had
been
practicing
making
copies
of
the
notice
at
the
suggestion
of
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
and
when
jopling
took
the
stand
he
was
called
upon
to
explain
an
affidavit
made
by
him
for
assistant
district
attorney
allen
in
which
he
affirmed
that
he
did
not
know
wrote
the
words
west
street
his
explanation
did
not
explain
and
anyhow
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
particular
reason
why
abraham
and
jopling
should
have
written
flechter
notice
for
him
besides
even
if
flechter
did
write
it
and
abraham
it
would
still
remain
almost
as
bad
for
flechter
if
it
was
shown
that
cave
dweller
was
his
own
but
bott
was
a
woman
who
appealed
strongly
to
a
jury
sympathies
and
she
was
clear
that
flechter
had
said
that
he
had
written
the
notice
moreover
she
recalled
that
the
date
had
first
been
written
and
that
flechter
had
erased
it
and
inserted
in
its
place
a
microscopic
examination
revealed
the
fact
that
such
an
erasure
had
been
made
when
the
smoke
cleared
the
credibility
of
the
defense
appeared
badly
damaged
but
the
precise
point
was
of
little
importance
after
all
the
great
question
was
the
identity
of
dweller
on
this
point
a
number
of
witnesses
testified
from
a
general
knowledge
of
flechter
handwriting
that
the
cave
dweller
letter
was
his
and
three
handwriting
experts
persifor
frazer
daniel
ames
and
david
carvalho
swore
that
in
their
opinion
the
same
hand
had
written
it
that
had
penned
the
notice
it
is
not
unlikely
that
flechter
fear
of
a
conviction
led
him
to
invite
testimony
in
his
behalf
which
would
not
bear
the
test
of
careful
scrutiny
many
an
innocent
man
has
paid
the
penalty
for
uncommitted
crime
because
he
has
sought
to
bolster
up
his
defense
with
doubtful
evidence
without
the
incubus
of
which
he
would
have
been
acquitted
naturally
the
chief
point
against
flechter
if
it
could
be
established
was
his
actual
possession
of
the
bott
stradivarius
when
he
was
arrested
upon
this
proposition
bott
was
absolutely
positive
beyond
the
possibility
of
error
so
were
eight
other
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
then
the
defense
produced
a
violin
alleged
to
be
the
same
one
exhibited
in
the
police
court
and
brought
by
flechter
to
durden
house
and
asked
bott
and
her
witnesses
what
they
thought
of
it
bott
could
not
identify
it
but
she
swore
no
less
positively
that
it
was
an
entirely
violin
from
the
one
which
she
had
seen
before
the
magistrate
then
osborne
hurled
his
bomb
over
his
enemy
parapet
and
cried
loudly
that
a
monstrous
wicked
fraud
had
been
perpetrated
to
thwart
justice
that
the
defense
had
faked
another
violin
and
were
now
trying
to
foist
the
bogus
thing
in
evidence
to
deceive
the
court
for
the
prosecution
now
swore
that
the
violin
so
produced
was
the
one
which
flechter
had
tried
to
sell
durden
of
course
it
would
have
been
comparatively
easy
to
fake
a
violin
just
as
osborne
claimed
and
the
case
sheds
some
light
upon
the
possibilities
of
the
old
violin
industry
the
star
witness
for
the
prosecution
to
prove
that
the
instrument
produced
in
the
police
court
the
bott
violin
was
august
gemunder
and
his
testimony
upon
the
trial
before
recorder
goff
is
worthy
of
careful
examination
since
the
jury
considered
it
of
great
importance
in
reaching
a
verdict
even
requesting
that
it
should
be
to
them
some
hours
after
retiring
to
deliberate
gemunder
testified
in
substance
that
he
belonged
to
a
family
which
had
been
making
violins
for
three
generations
and
had
himself
been
making
them
for
twenty
years
that
he
was
familiar
with
bott
stradivarius
having
seen
it
three
times
and
that
he
firmly
believed
a
large
part
of
the
violin
produced
before
the
magistrate
the
missing
bott
certainly
the
back
and
scroll
moreover
he
was
able
to
describe
the
markings
of
the
bott
violin
even
to
the
label
inside
it
it
should
be
mentioned
however
that
in
the
magistrate
court
he
had
been
called
only
to
the
bott
violin
and
not
to
the
one
produced
as
the
bott
itself
he
further
swore
that
the
violin
now
offered
by
the
defense
on
the
trial
was
the
one
in
evidence
before
the
magistrate
but
was
one
which
he
had
sold
some
years
before
to
one
charles
palm
the
defense
on
the
other
hand
called
among
its
witnesses
john
frederick
a
violin
maker
who
testified
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
bott
strad
and
had
seen
it
in
at
bott
house
grenecher
castle
in
germany
that
he
had
repaired
it
in
this
country
in
that
the
instrument
in
court
was
not
a
strad
nor
even
a
good
imitation
of
one
and
of
course
was
not
the
duke
of
cambridge
but
that
it
the
identical
instrument
produced
before
the
magistrate
and
one
which
he
recognized
as
having
been
sent
him
for
repair
by
charles
palm
in
thus
both
sides
agreed
that
the
fiddle
now
offered
in
evidence
was
a
bogus
strad
once
belonging
to
a
man
named
palm
the
only
element
of
conflict
being
as
to
whether
or
not
the
violin
which
flechter
had
offered
for
sale
was
the
palm
instrument
or
in
fact
bott
famous
duke
of
cambridge
all
this
technical
testimony
about
violins
and
violin
structure
naturally
bored
the
jury
almost
to
extinction
and
even
the
bitter
personal
encounters
of
counsel
did
not
serve
to
relieve
the
dreariness
of
the
trial
one
oasis
of
humor
in
this
desert
of
dry
evidence
gave
them
passing
refreshment
when
a
picturesque
witness
for
the
defense
an
instrument
maker
named
franz
bruckner
from
south
germany
having
been
asked
if
the
violin
shown
him
was
a
replied
with
a
grunt
of
disgust
ach
himmel
nein
being
then
invited
to
describe
all
the
characteristics
of
genuine
stradivarius
workmanship
he
tore
his
hair
and
with
an
expression
of
utter
hopelessness
upon
his
wrinkled
face
exclaimed
despairingly
to
the
interpreter
doctor
if
i
gave
you
lessons
in
this
every
day
for
three
weeks
you
would
know
no
more
than
you
do
now
an
answer
which
was
probably
true
and
equally
so
of
the
jury
who
were
shouldered
with
the
almost
impossible
task
of
determining
from
this
mass
of
conflicting
opinion
just
where
the
truth
really
lay
the
chief
witness
for
the
defense
was
john
eller
who
testified
that
he
had
been
a
musician
for
thirty
years
and
a
collector
of
violins
that
the
violin
in
court
was
the
same
one
produced
before
the
magistrate
and
was
not
bott
but
that
he
had
first
seen
it
in
the
possession
of
charles
palm
in
in
his
house
in
eighth
street
and
mark
place
new
york
city
had
borrowed
it
from
palm
and
played
on
it
for
two
months
in
seabright
and
had
finally
purchased
it
from
palm
in
and
continued
to
play
in
concerts
upon
it
until
having
been
loaned
by
him
to
a
music
teacher
named
perotti
in
street
it
was
stolen
by
the
latter
and
sold
to
flechter
it
appeared
that
eller
had
at
once
brought
suit
against
flechter
for
the
possession
of
the
instrument
which
suit
he
asserted
he
was
still
pressing
in
the
courts
and
he
now
declared
that
the
violin
was
in
exactly
the
same
condition
in
every
respect
as
when
produced
in
the
police
court
although
it
had
been
changed
in
some
respects
since
it
had
been
stolen
it
had
originally
been
made
of
baked
wood
by
one
dedier
nicholas
an
instrument
maker
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
stamped
with
the
maker
name
but
this
inscription
was
now
covered
by
a
stradivarius
label
eller
scornfully
pointed
out
that
no
strad
had
ever
been
made
of
baked
wood
and
showed
the
jury
certain
pegs
used
by
no
other
maker
than
nicholas
and
certain
marks
worn
upon
the
instrument
by
his
the
witness
own
playing
he
also
exhibited
the
check
with
which
he
had
paid
for
it
in
support
of
this
evidence
charles
palm
himself
was
called
by
the
defense
and
identified
the
violin
as
one
which
he
had
bought
some
twelve
years
before
for
fifteen
or
twenty
dollars
and
later
sold
to
eller
upon
the
question
of
the
identity
of
the
instrument
then
lying
before
the
jury
this
evidence
was
conclusive
but
of
course
it
did
not
satisfy
the
jury
as
to
whether
flechter
had
tried
to
sell
the
palm
violin
or
bott
violin
to
durden
unfortunately
eller
evidence
threw
a
side
light
on
the
defence
without
which
the
trial
might
well
have
resulted
in
an
acquittal
eller
had
sworn
that
he
was
still
vigorously
endeavoring
to
get
the
palm
violin
back
from
flechter
as
contradicting
him
in
this
respect
and
as
tending
to
show
that
the
suit
had
not
only
been
compromised
but
that
he
and
flechter
were
engaged
in
trying
to
put
off
the
palm
violin
as
a
genuine
stradivarius
and
share
the
profit
of
the
fraud
the
prosecution
introduced
the
following
letter
from
the
witness
to
his
lawyer
clifton
house
chicago
illinois
received
your
letter
just
now
i
have
been
expecting
flechter
lawyer
would
settle
with
you
he
got
nine
hundred
dollars
for
the
violin
and
meyer
arranged
with
myself
for
the
half
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
which
he
proposed
himself
and
have
been
expecting
a
settlement
on
their
part
long
ago
i
have
assisted
palmer
his
able
lawyer
with
the
best
of
my
ability
have
covered
flechter
shortcomings
of
faking
the
violin
to
a
yours
most
sincerely
john
eller
metropolitan
opera
chicago
from
this
letter
it
was
fairly
inferable
that
although
the
defendant
might
be
innocent
of
the
precise
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
he
was
nevertheless
upon
his
own
evidence
guilty
of
having
faked
a
cheap
nicholas
violin
into
a
and
of
having
offered
it
for
sale
for
the
exorbitant
price
of
five
thousand
dollars
this
luckless
piece
of
evidence
undoubtedly
influenced
the
jury
to
convict
him
it
will
be
recalled
that
ten
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
had
sworn
that
the
violin
offered
in
evidence
at
the
trial
was
the
one
produced
in
the
police
court
as
against
the
defendant
five
who
asserted
that
it
the
testimony
was
all
highly
technical
and
confusing
and
the
jury
probably
relied
more
upon
their
general
impressions
of
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
than
upon
anything
else
it
is
likely
that
most
of
the
testimony
on
both
sides
in
regard
to
the
identity
of
the
violin
was
honestly
given
for
the
question
was
one
upon
which
a
genuine
divergence
of
opinion
was
easily
possible
eller
letter
from
chicago
so
affected
the
jury
that
they
disregarded
his
testimony
and
reverted
to
that
of
august
gemunder
to
whose
evidence
attention
has
already
been
called
and
who
swore
that
it
was
the
duke
of
cambridge
which
flechter
had
tried
to
sell
to
durden
alas
for
the
fallibility
of
even
the
most
honest
of
witnesses
the
case
was
ably
argued
by
both
sides
and
every
phase
of
this
curious
tangle
of
evidence
given
its
due
consideration
the
defense
very
properly
laid
stress
upon
the
fact
that
it
would
have
been
a
ridiculous
performance
for
flechter
to
write
the
cave
dweller
letter
and
state
therein
that
he
was
a
violin
dealer
or
maker
thus
pointing
unmistakably
to
himself
and
to
further
state
that
for
one
in
his
position
to
dispose
of
it
would
be
difficult
and
dangerous
the
only
explanation
for
the
cave
dweller
letter
which
they
could
offer
however
was
that
some
one
interested
in
procuring
flechter
downfall
had
caused
it
to
be
sent
for
that
purpose
this
might
either
be
a
business
rival
or
some
one
connected
with
the
prosecution
while
palmer
was
summing
up
for
the
defense
he
noticed
assistant
district
attorney
allen
smiling
and
dramatically
turning
upon
him
he
shouted
this
is
no
laughing
matter
colonel
allen
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
whether
this
man
is
to
be
allowed
to
go
home
and
kiss
his
little
ones
or
whether
he
is
to
be
cast
into
jail
because
you
used
your
brains
to
concoct
a
theory
against
him
another
consideration
which
seemed
deserving
of
weight
was
that
if
flechter
did
steal
the
duke
of
cambridge
it
would
have
been
a
piece
of
incredible
folly
and
carelessness
upon
his
part
to
leave
it
in
such
an
exposed
place
as
the
safe
of
his
store
where
it
could
be
found
by
the
police
or
shown
by
the
to
any
one
who
called
yet
the
positive
identification
of
august
gemunder
and
the
fatal
disclosures
of
eller
coupled
with
the
vehement
insistence
of
the
prosecution
led
the
jury
to
resolve
what
doubt
they
had
in
the
case
against
the
prisoner
and
after
deliberating
eight
or
ten
hours
and
being
out
all
night
they
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
flechter
broke
down
and
declared
bitterly
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
upon
the
part
of
his
enemies
assisted
by
a
too
credulous
prosecuting
attorney
everybody
admitted
that
it
was
an
extraordinary
case
but
the
press
was
consistent
in
its
clamor
against
flechter
and
opinion
generally
was
that
he
had
been
rightly
convicted
on
may
he
was
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
for
twelve
months
but
after
being
incarcerated
in
the
tombs
for
three
weeks
he
secured
a
certificate
of
reasonable
doubt
and
a
stay
until
his
conviction
could
be
reviewed
on
appeal
then
he
gave
bail
and
was
released
but
he
had
been
in
jail
flechter
will
never
forget
that
and
for
the
time
being
at
least
his
reputation
was
gone
his
family
disgraced
and
his
business
ruined
a
calm
reading
of
the
record
of
the
trial
suggests
that
the
case
abounded
in
doubts
more
or
less
reasonable
and
that
the
court
might
well
have
taken
it
from
the
jury
on
that
account
but
a
printed
page
of
questions
and
answers
carries
with
it
no
more
than
a
suggestion
of
the
value
of
testimony
the
real
significance
of
which
lies
in
the
manner
in
which
it
is
given
the
tone
of
the
voice
and
the
flash
of
the
eye
once
again
flechter
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
window
behind
the
great
gilded
fiddle
to
him
as
to
its
owner
the
great
stradivarius
had
brought
only
sorrow
but
for
him
the
world
had
no
pity
surely
the
strains
of
this
wonderful
instrument
must
have
had
a
dying
fall
even
when
played
by
the
loving
hand
of
old
jean
bott
at
last
after
several
years
in
the
case
came
up
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
flechter
had
been
led
to
believe
that
his
conviction
would
undoubtedly
be
reversed
and
a
new
trial
ordered
which
would
be
tantamount
to
an
acquittal
for
it
was
hardly
likely
in
such
an
event
that
a
second
trial
would
be
considered
advisable
upon
the
same
evidence
but
to
his
great
disappointment
his
conviction
was
sustained
by
a
divided
court
in
which
only
two
of
the
five
justices
voted
for
a
new
trial
again
fortune
had
averted
her
face
if
only
one
more
judge
had
thought
the
evidence
insufficient
the
great
gilded
fiddle
seemed
to
flechter
an
omen
of
misfortune
once
more
he
gave
bail
this
time
in
five
thousand
dollars
and
was
set
at
liberty
pending
his
appeal
to
the
highest
court
in
the
state
once
more
he
took
his
seat
in
his
office
and
tried
to
carry
on
his
business
but
time
had
dragged
on
people
had
forgotten
all
about
flechter
and
the
lost
stradivarius
and
when
his
conviction
was
affirmed
little
notice
was
taken
of
the
fact
it
was
generally
assumed
that
having
been
sentenced
he
was
in
jail
then
something
happened
which
once
more
dragged
flechter
into
the
limelight
editors
rushed
to
their
files
and
dusted
the
cobwebs
off
the
issues
containing
the
accounts
of
the
trial
the
sign
of
the
gilded
fiddle
became
the
daily
centre
of
a
throng
of
excited
musicians
lawyers
and
reporters
the
lost
stradivarius
the
great
duke
of
cambridge
the
nemesis
of
bott
and
of
flechter
was
found
by
flechter
himself
as
he
claimed
on
august
according
to
the
dealer
and
his
witnesses
the
amazing
discovery
occurred
in
this
wise
a
violin
maker
named
joseph
farr
who
at
one
time
had
worked
for
flechter
and
had
testified
in
his
behalf
at
the
trial
to
the
effect
that
the
instrument
produced
in
the
police
court
was
bott
stradivarius
saw
by
chance
a
very
fine
violin
in
the
possession
of
a
family
named
springer
in
brooklyn
and
notified
flechter
of
the
fact
the
latter
who
was
always
ready
to
purchase
choice
violins
after
vainly
trying
for
a
long
time
to
induce
the
springers
to
bring
it
to
new
york
called
with
farr
upon
springer
and
asked
to
examine
it
to
his
utter
astonishment
she
produced
for
his
inspection
bott
stradivarius
hardly
able
to
control
his
excitement
flechter
immediately
returned
to
new
york
and
reported
the
discovery
to
the
police
who
instantly
began
a
thorough
examination
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
its
discovery
the
district
attorney
office
and
the
detective
bureau
were
at
first
highly
suspicious
of
this
opportune
discovery
on
the
part
of
a
convicted
felon
of
the
precise
evidence
necessary
to
clear
him
but
it
was
soon
demonstrated
to
their
pretty
general
satisfaction
that
the
famous
stradivarius
had
in
fact
been
pawned
in
the
shop
of
one
benjamin
fox
on
the
very
day
and
within
an
hour
of
the
theft
together
with
its
case
and
two
bows
for
the
insignificant
sum
of
four
dollars
after
the
legal
period
of
redemption
had
expired
it
had
been
put
up
at
auction
and
bid
in
by
the
pawnbroker
for
a
small
advance
over
the
sum
for
which
it
had
been
pawned
it
lay
exposed
for
purchase
on
fox
shelf
for
some
months
until
in
december
a
tailor
named
james
dooly
visited
the
shop
to
redeem
a
silver
watch
being
at
the
same
time
in
funds
and
able
to
satisfy
his
taste
as
a
virtuoso
he
felt
the
need
of
and
bought
a
violin
for
ten
dollars
but
fox
urging
upon
him
the
desirability
of
getting
a
good
one
while
he
was
about
it
was
finally
persuaded
to
purchase
the
bott
violin
for
twenty
dollars
in
its
stead
dooly
took
it
home
played
upon
it
as
the
spirit
moved
and
whenever
in
need
of
ready
money
brought
it
back
to
fox
as
security
always
redeeming
it
in
time
to
prevent
its
sale
one
day
being
at
springer
where
he
was
accustomed
to
purchase
tailor
trimmings
he
offered
it
to
her
for
sale
and
as
her
son
was
taking
violin
lessons
induced
her
to
buy
it
for
thirty
dollars
and
in
the
house
of
the
springers
it
had
quietly
remained
ever
since
while
lawyers
and
prosecutors
wrangled
and
thundered
and
witnesses
swore
positively
to
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
to
prove
that
flechter
stole
the
violin
and
tried
to
sell
it
to
durden
on
these
facts
which
did
not
seem
to
admit
of
contradiction
recorder
goff
ordered
an
oral
examination
of
all
the
witnesses
the
hearing
of
which
sandwiched
in
between
the
current
trials
in
his
court
dragged
along
for
months
but
which
finally
resulted
in
establishing
to
the
court
satisfaction
that
the
violin
discovered
in
the
possession
of
the
springers
was
the
genuine
duke
of
cambridge
and
that
it
could
not
have
been
in
flechter
possession
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
on
july
eight
years
after
bott
death
and
the
arrest
and
indictment
of
flechter
for
the
theft
of
the
violin
a
picturesque
group
assembled
in
the
general
sessions
there
was
flechter
and
his
lawyer
springer
and
her
son
the
attorneys
for
the
prosecution
and
lastly
old
bott
the
seals
of
the
case
were
broken
and
the
violin
identified
by
the
widow
as
that
of
her
husband
the
springers
waived
all
claim
to
the
violin
and
the
court
dismissed
the
indictment
against
the
defendant
and
ordered
the
stradivarius
to
be
delivered
to
bott
with
these
words
bott
it
affords
very
great
pleasure
to
the
court
to
give
the
violin
to
you
you
have
suffered
many
years
of
sorrow
and
trouble
in
regard
to
it
eight
years
sighed
the
old
lady
clasping
the
violin
in
her
arms
i
wish
you
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
its
possession
continued
the
recorder
thus
ended
as
a
matter
of
record
the
case
of
the
people
against
flechter
for
eight
years
the
violin
dealer
and
his
family
had
endured
the
agony
of
disgrace
he
had
spent
a
fortune
in
his
defense
and
had
nevertheless
been
convicted
of
a
crime
of
which
he
was
at
last
proved
innocent
yet
there
are
those
who
when
the
case
is
mentioned
shake
their
heads
wisely
as
if
to
say
that
the
whole
story
of
the
lost
stradivarius
has
never
been
told
iv
the
last
of
the
sir
replied
the
knave
unabashed
i
am
one
of
those
who
do
make
a
living
by
their
wits
john
felix
a
dealer
in
automatic
musical
instruments
in
new
york
city
was
swindled
out
of
on
february
by
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
game
during
the
previous
august
a
man
calling
himself
by
the
name
of
nelson
had
hired
room
in
a
building
at
east
street
as
a
school
for
wireless
telegraphy
later
on
he
had
installed
over
a
dozen
deal
tables
each
fitted
with
a
complete
set
of
ordinary
telegraph
instruments
and
connected
with
wires
which
while
apparently
passing
out
of
the
windows
in
reality
plunged
behind
a
desk
into
a
small
dry
battery
each
table
was
fitted
with
a
shaded
electric
and
the
room
was
furnished
with
the
ordinary
paraphernalia
of
a
telegraph
office
the
janitor
never
observed
any
activity
in
the
school
there
seemed
to
be
no
pupils
and
no
one
haunted
the
place
except
a
short
person
who
appeared
monthly
and
paid
the
rent
on
the
afternoon
of
february
felix
was
called
to
the
telephone
of
his
store
and
asked
to
make
an
appointment
later
in
the
afternoon
with
a
gentleman
named
nelson
who
desired
to
submit
to
him
a
business
proposition
fifteen
minutes
afterward
nelson
arrived
in
person
and
introduced
himself
as
having
met
felix
at
lou
gambling
house
he
then
produced
a
copy
of
the
which
contained
an
article
to
the
effect
that
the
western
union
telegraph
company
was
about
to
resume
its
service
that
is
to
say
to
supply
the
pool
rooms
with
the
telegraphic
returns
of
the
various
being
run
in
different
parts
of
the
united
states
the
paper
also
contained
in
connection
with
this
item
of
news
a
photograph
which
might
by
a
stretch
of
the
imagination
have
been
taken
to
resemble
nelson
himself
felix
who
was
a
german
gentleman
of
french
sympathies
married
to
an
american
lady
had
recently
returned
to
america
after
a
ten
sojourn
in
europe
he
had
had
an
extensive
commercial
career
was
possessed
of
a
considerable
fortune
and
had
at
length
determined
to
settle
in
new
york
where
he
could
invest
his
money
to
advantage
and
at
the
same
time
conduct
a
conservative
and
harmonious
business
in
musical
instruments
like
the
teutons
of
old
dwelling
among
the
forests
of
the
elbe
felix
knew
the
fascination
of
games
of
chance
and
he
had
heard
the
merry
song
of
the
wheel
at
both
hambourg
and
monte
carlo
in
europe
the
pleasures
of
the
gaming
table
had
been
comparatively
inexpensive
but
in
new
york
for
some
unknown
reason
the
fickle
goddess
had
not
favored
him
and
he
had
lost
upward
of
zu
viel
as
he
himself
expressed
it
being
of
a
philosophic
disposition
however
he
had
pocketed
his
losses
and
contented
himself
with
the
consoling
thought
that
whereas
he
might
have
lost
all
he
had
in
fact
lost
only
a
part
it
might
well
have
been
that
had
not
the
tempter
appeared
in
the
person
of
his
afternoon
visitor
he
would
have
remained
status
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
in
the
sunny
window
of
his
musical
store
surrounded
by
zitherns
dulcimers
psalteries
sackbuts
and
other
instrument
of
melody
the
advent
of
nelson
produced
the
effect
of
a
sudden
and
unexpected
discord
felix
distrusted
him
from
the
very
first
the
proposition
was
simplicity
itself
it
appeared
that
nelson
was
in
the
employ
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
which
had
just
opened
a
branch
office
for
racing
news
at
east
street
this
branch
was
under
the
superintendence
of
an
old
associate
and
intimate
friend
of
nelson
by
the
name
of
mcpherson
assuming
that
they
could
find
some
one
with
the
requisite
amount
of
cash
they
could
all
make
their
everlasting
fortunes
by
simply
having
mcpherson
withhold
the
news
of
some
race
from
the
pool
rooms
long
enough
to
allow
one
of
the
others
to
place
a
large
bet
upon
some
horse
which
had
in
fact
already
won
and
was
resting
comfortably
in
the
stable
felix
grasped
the
idea
instantly
at
the
same
time
he
had
his
suspicions
of
his
visitor
it
seemed
peculiar
that
he
an
inconspicuous
citizen
who
had
already
lost
in
gambling
houses
should
be
selected
as
the
recipient
of
such
a
momentous
opportunity
moreover
he
knew
very
well
that
gentlemen
in
gambling
houses
were
never
introduced
at
all
he
thought
he
detected
the
odor
of
a
rodent
he
naïvely
inquired
why
if
all
these
things
were
so
nelson
and
his
friend
were
not
already
yet
millionaires
two
or
three
times
the
answer
was
at
once
forthcoming
that
they
been
but
also
had
been
robbed
unmercifully
robbed
by
one
in
whom
they
had
had
confidence
and
to
whom
they
had
entrusted
their
money
and
now
we
are
poor
penniless
clerks
sighed
nelson
and
if
we
should
offer
to
make
a
big
bet
ourselves
the
gamblers
would
be
suspicious
and
probably
refuse
to
place
it
i
think
this
looks
like
a
schvindling
game
said
felix
shrewdly
so
it
did
so
it
was
by
and
by
felix
put
on
his
hat
and
escorted
by
nelson
paid
a
visit
to
the
branch
office
at
east
street
where
once
solitude
had
reigned
supreme
and
the
spider
had
spun
his
web
amid
the
dust
all
was
now
tumultuous
activity
fifteen
busy
operators
in
eye
shades
and
shirt
sleeves
took
the
news
hot
from
the
humming
wires
and
clicked
it
off
to
the
waiting
pool
rooms
scarecrow
wins
by
a
neck
cried
one
blackbird
second
make
the
odds
to
shouted
a
short
man
who
sat
at
a
desk
puffing
a
large
black
cigar
the
place
buzzed
like
a
beehive
and
ticked
like
a
clockmaker
it
had
an
atmosphere
of
breathless
excitement
all
its
own
felix
watched
and
marvelled
wondering
if
dreams
came
true
the
short
man
strolled
over
and
condescended
to
make
felix
acquaintance
an
hour
later
the
three
of
them
were
closeted
among
the
zitherns
at
the
same
moment
the
fifteen
operators
were
ranged
in
a
line
in
front
of
a
neighboring
bar
their
elbows
simultaneously
elevated
at
an
angle
of
degrees
felix
still
had
lingering
doubts
had
mcpherson
some
little
paper
a
letter
a
bill
a
receipt
or
a
check
to
show
that
he
was
really
in
the
employ
of
the
western
union
no
said
mac
but
he
had
something
better
the
badge
which
he
had
received
as
the
fastest
operator
among
the
company
employees
felix
wanted
to
see
it
but
mac
explained
that
it
was
locked
up
in
the
vault
at
the
farmers
loan
and
trust
to
felix
this
had
a
safe
sound
farmers
trust
then
matters
began
to
move
rapidly
it
was
arranged
that
felix
should
go
down
in
the
morning
and
get
from
his
bankers
seligman
and
meyer
after
that
he
was
to
meet
nelson
at
the
store
and
go
with
him
to
the
pool
room
where
the
big
financiers
played
their
money
mcpherson
was
to
remain
at
the
office
and
telephone
them
the
results
of
the
races
in
advance
by
nightfall
they
would
be
worth
half
a
million
i
hope
you
have
a
good
large
safe
remarked
nelson
tentatively
the
three
conspirators
parted
with
mutual
expressions
of
confidence
and
esteem
next
morning
felix
went
to
his
bankers
and
procured
in
five
bills
the
day
passed
very
slowly
there
was
not
even
a
flurry
in
zitherns
he
waited
impatiently
for
nelson
who
was
to
come
at
five
at
last
nelson
arrived
and
they
hurried
to
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
where
the
was
to
take
place
and
now
another
marvel
wassermann
brothers
office
which
closes
at
three
hummed
just
as
the
office
had
done
the
evening
before
and
with
the
very
same
bees
although
felix
did
not
recognize
them
it
was
crowded
with
men
who
struggled
violently
with
one
another
in
their
eagerness
to
force
their
bets
into
the
hands
of
a
person
who
felix
was
informed
was
the
trusted
cashier
of
the
establishment
and
the
sums
were
so
large
that
even
felix
gasped

another

all
made

from

to

a
man
standing
beside
a

shouted
the

and
read
off
the

a
deafening
uproar
hats
were
tossed
ceilingward
and
great
wads
of
money
were
passed
out
by
the
trusted
cashier
to
indifferent
millionaires
felix
wanted
to
rush
in
and
bet
at
once
on
something
if
he
waited
it
might
be
too
late
was
it
necessary
to
be
introduced
to
the
cashier
no
would
he
take
the
bet
all
right
but
at
that
moment
a
page
elbowed
his
way
among
the
money
calling
plaintively
for
felix
mr
felix
shrinking
at
the
thought
of
such
publicity
in
such
distinguished

felix
caught
the

and
learned
that

was

in

calling
out
that

were
off

that

unhesitatingly
admitted
that

it
was
still
in

possession
and
still
intact
in
its
original
form
he
denied
however
any
knowledge
of
wyatt
whereabouts
the
reason
for
this
indifference
became
apparent
when
the
two
prisoners
were
arraigned
in
the

court

their
counsel
demanded
their
instant
discharge
on
the
ground
that

crime

they
could
be
prosecuted
he
cited
an
old
new

case
mccord
the

which
seemed
in
a
general
way
to
sustain
his
contention
and
which
had
been
followed
by
another
and
much
more
recent
decision
the
people
livingston
the
first
of
these
cases
had
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
general
doctrine
had
been
annunciated
that
where
a
person
parts
with
his
money
for
an
unlawful
or
dishonest
purpose
even
though
he
is
tricked
into
so
doing
by
false
pretences
a
prosecution
for
the
crime
of
larceny
can
not
be
maintained

in
the
mccord
case
the
defendant
had
falsely
pretended
to
the
complainant
a
man
named
miller
that
he
was
a
police
officer
and
held
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
by
these
means
he
had
induced
miller
to
give
him
a
gold
watch
and
a
diamond
ring
as
the
price
of
his
liberty
the
conviction
in
this
case
was
reversed
on
the
ground
that
miller
parted
with
his
property
for
an
unlawful
purpose
but
there
was
a
very
strong
dissenting
opinion
from
justice
peckham
now
a
member
of
the
bench
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
second
case
that
of
livingston
the
complainant
had
been
defrauded
out
of
by
means
of
the
green
goods
game
but
this
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
appellate
division
of
the
second
department
on
the
authority
of
the
mccord
case
the
opinion
in
this
case
was
written
by
justice
cullen
now
chief
judge
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
who
says
in
conclusion
we
very
much
regret
being
compelled
to
reverse
this
conviction
even
if
the
prosecutor
intended
to
deal
in
counterfeit
money
that
is
no
reason
why
the
appellant
should
go
unwhipped
of
justice
we
venture
to
suggest
that
it
might
be
well
for
the
legislature
to
alter
the
rule
laid
down
in
mccord
people
well
might
the
judges
regret
being
compelled
to
set
a
rogue
at
liberty
simply
because
he
had
been
ingenious
enough
to
invent
a
fraud
very
likely
with
the
assistance
of
a
shyster
lawyer
which
involved
the
additional
turpitude
of
seducing
another
into
a
criminal
conspiracy
livingston
was
turned
loose
upon
the
community
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
swindled
a
man
out
of
because
he
had
incidentally
led
the
latter
to
believe
that
in
return
he
was
to
receive
counterfeit
money
or
green
goods
which
might
be
put
into
circulation
yet
because
some
years
before
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
the
mccord
matter
adopted
the
rule
followed
in
civil
cases
to
wit
that
as
the
complaining
witness
was
himself
in
fault
and
did
not
come
into
court
with
clean
hands
he
could
have
no
standing
before
them
the
appellate
division
in
the
next
case
felt
obliged
to
follow
them
and
to
rule
tantamount
to
saying
that
two
wrongs
could
make
a
right
and
two
knaves
one
honest
man
it
may
seem
a
trifle
unfair
to
put
it
in
just
this
way
but
when
one
realizes
the
iniquity
of
such
a
doctrine
as
applied
to
criminal
cases
it
is
hard
to
speak
softly
thus
the
broad
and
general
doctrine
seemed
to
be
established
that
so
long
as
a
thief
could
induce
his
victim
to
believe
that
it
was
to
his
advantage
to
enter
into
a
dishonest
transaction
he
might
defraud
him
to
any
extent
in
his
power
immediately
there
sprang
into
being
hordes
of
swindlers
who
aided
by
adroit
shyster
lawyers
invented
all
sorts
of
schemes
which
involved
some
sort
of
dishonesty
upon
the
part
of
the
person
to
be
defrauded
the
of
whom
larry
summerfield
was
the
napoleon
the
and
men
and
the
sick
engineers
flocked
to
new
york
which
under
the
unwitting
protection
of
the
court
of
appeals
became
a
veritable
mecca
for
persons
of
their
ilk
to
readers
unfamiliar
with
the
cast
of
mind
of
professional
criminals
it
will
be
almost
impossible
to
appreciate
with
what
bold
insouciance
these
vultures
now
hovered
over
the
metropolitan
barnyard
had
not
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized
their
profession
they
had
nothing
to
fear
the
law
was
on
their
side
they
walked
the
streets
flaunting
their
immunity
in
the
very
face
of
the
police
became
an
industry
a
legalized
industry
with
which
the
authorities
might
interfere
at
their
peril
indeed
there
is
one
instance
in
which
a
successfully
prosecuted
his
victim
after
he
had
trimmed
him
upon
a
charge
of
grand
larceny
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction
one
crook
bred
another
every
time
he
made
a
victim
and
the
disease
of
crime
the
most
infectious
of
all
distempers
ate
its
way
unchecked
into
the
body
politic
broadway
was
thronged
by
a
prosperous
gentry
the
aristocracy
and
elite
of
knavery
who
dressed
resplendently
flourished
like
the
green
and
spent
their
or
rather
their
victims
money
with
the
lavish
hand
of
one
of
dumas
gentlemen
but
the
evil
did
not
stop
there
seeing
that
their
brothers
prospered
in
new
york
and
neither
being
learned
in
the
law
nor
gifted
with
the
power
of
nice
discrimination
between
rogueries
all
the
other
knaves
in
the
country
took
it
for
granted
that
they
had
at
last
found
the
elysian
fields
and
came
trooping
here
by
hundreds
to
ply
their
various
trades
the
mccord
case
stood
out
like
a
cabalistic
sign
upon
a
telling
all
the
rascals
who
passed
that
way
that
the
city
was
full
of
honest
folk
waiting
to
be
turned
into
rogues
and
trimmed
and
presently
we
did
pass
a
narrow
lane
and
at
the
mouth
espied
a
written
stone
telling
beggars
by
a
word
like
a
wee
pitchfork
to
go
that
way
the
tip
went
abroad
that
the
city
was
good
graft
for
everybody
and
in
the
train
of
the
thronged
the
flimflammer
confidence
man
booster
capper
and
every
sort
of
affiliated
crook
recalling
charles
reade
account
in
the
cloister
and
the
hearth
of
gerard
in
lorraine
among
their
kin
of
another
period
with
them
and
all
they
had
was
lightly
come
and
lightly
go
and
when
we
left
them
my
master
said
to
me
this
is
thy
first
lesson
but
we
shall
be
at
hansburgh
come
with
me
to
the
there
and
i
show
thee
all
our
folk
and
their
lays
and
especially
lossners
dutzers
schleppers

whom
in

all
these
caitiffs
and
their
accursed
names
for
knowledge
is
knowledge
but
go
among
them
alive
or
dead
that
will
i
not
with
my
good
will
and
a
large
part
of
it
was
due
simply
to
the
fact
that
seven
learned
men
upon
seven
comfortable
chairs
in
the
city
of
albany
had
said
many
years
ago
that
neither
the
law
or
public
policy
designs
the
protection
of
rogues
in
their
dealings
with
each
other
or
to
insure
fair
dealing
and
truthfulness
as
between
each
other
in
their
dishonest
practices
the
reason
that
the
game
was
supposed
to
come
within
the
scope
of
the
mccord
case
was
this
it
deluded
the
victim
into
the
belief
that
he
was
going
to
cheat
the
pool
room
by
placing
a
bet
upon
a
sure
thing
secondarily
it
involved
as
the
dupe
supposed
the
theft
or
disclosure
of
messages
which
were
being
transmitted
over
the
lines
of
a
telegraph
company
a
misdemeanor
hence
it
was
argued
the
victim
was
as
much
a
thief
as
the
proposer
of
the
scheme
had
parted
with
his
money
for
a
dishonest
purpose
did
not
come
into
court
with
clean
hands
and
no
prosecution
could
be
sustained
no
matter
whether
he
had
been
led
to
give
up
his
money
by
means
of
false
pretences
or
not
while
differed
technically
from
the
precise
frauds
committed
by
mccord
and
livingston
it
nevertheless
closely
resembled
those
swindlers
in
general
character
and
came
clearly
within
the
doctrine
that
the
law
was
not
designed
to
protect
rogues
in
their
dealings
with
each
other
no
genuine
attempt
had
ever
been
made
to
prosecute
one
of
these
gentry
until
the
catastrophe
which
deprived
felix
of
his
the
rolled
in
money
indeed
the
fraternity
were
so
liberal
with
their
rolls
that
they
became
friendly
with
certain
police
officials
and
intimately
affiliated
with
various
politicians
of
influence
a
friend
of
one
of
whom
went
on
summerfield
bond
when
the
latter
was
being
prosecuted
for
the
frauds
to
the
extent
of
they
regularly
went
to
europe
in
the
summer
season
and
could
be
seen
at
all
the
and
gambling
resorts
of
the
continent
it
is
amusing
to
chronicle
in
this
connection
that
just
prior
to
mcpherson
arrest
that
is
to
say
during
the
summer
vacation
of
he
crossed
the
atlantic
on
the
same
steamer
with
an
assistant
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
who
failed
to
recognize
his
ship
companion
and
found
him
an
entertaining
and
agreeable
comrade
the
trial
came
on
before
judge
warren
foster
in
part
of
the
general
sessions
on
february
a
special
panel
quickly
supplied
a
jury
which
after
hearing
the
evidence
returned
in
short
order
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
judge
foster
believed
the
mccord
case
to
be
still
the
law
of
the
state
he
of
his
own
motion
and
with
commendable
independence
immediately
arrested
judgment
the
people
thereupon
appealed
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
judge
foster
and
the
defendant
was
discharged
it
is
however
satisfactory
to
record
that
the
legislature
at
its
next
session
amended
the
penal
code
in
such
a
way
as
to
entirely
deprive
the
and
their
kind
of
the
erstwhile
protection
which
they
had
enjoyed
under
the
law
v
the
franklin
syndicate
when
robert
ammon
a
member
of
the
new
york
bar
was
convicted
after
a
long
trial
on
the
of
june
of
receiving
stolen
goods
he
had
in
the
parlance
of
his
class
been
due
for
a
long
time
the
stolen
property
in
question
was
the
sum
of
thirty
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
in
greenbacks
part
of
the
loot
of
the
notorious
franklin
syndicate
devised
and
engineered
by
william
miller
who
later
became
the
catspaw
of
his
legal
adviser
the
subject
of
this
history
ammon
stood
at
the
bar
and
listened
complacently
to
his
sentence
of
not
less
than
four
years
at
hard
labor
in
sing
sing
a
sneer
curved
his
lips
as
after
nodding
curtly
to
his
lawyer
he
turned
to
be
led
away
by
the
court
attendant
the
fortune
snatched
from
his
client
had
procured
for
him
the
most
adroit
of
counsel
the
most
exhaustive
of
trials
he
knew
that
nothing
had
been
left
undone
to
enable
him
to
evade
the
consequences
of
his
crime
and
he
was
cynically
content
for
years
bob
ammon
had
been
a
familiar
figure
in
the
wall
street
district
of
new
york
although
the
legal
adviser
of
swindlers
and
confidence
men
he
was
a
type
of
american
whose
energies
if
turned
in
a
less
dubious
direction
might
well
have
brought
him
honorable
distinction
tall
strong
as
a
bull
bluff
reckless
and
of

nerve
he
would
have
given
good
account

himself
as
an
indian
fighter
or
frontiersman
his
fine
presence
his
great
vitality
his
coarse
humor
his
confidence
and
bravado
had
won
for
him
many
friends
of
a
certain
kind
and
engendered
a
feeling
among
the
public
that
somehow
although
the
associate
and
adviser
of
criminals
he
was
outside
the
law
to
the
circumventing
of
which
his
energies
were
directed
unfortunately
his
experiences
with
the
law
had
bred
in
him
a
contempt
for
it
which
ultimately
caused
his
downfall
the
reporters
arc
bothering
you
are

had
said
to
miller
in
his
office
hang
them
send

to

i
talk
to
them
and
talk
to
them
he
did
he
could
talk
a
police
inspector
or
a
city
magistrate
into
a
state
of
vacuous
credulity
and
needless
to
say
he
was
to
his
clients
as
a
god
knowing
both
good
and
evil
as
well
as
how
to
eschew
the
one
and
avoid

miller
hated
loathed
and
feared
him
yet
freely
entrusted
his
liberty
and
all
he
had
risked
his
liberty
to
gain
to
this
strange
and
powerful
personality
which
held
him
enthralled
by
the
mere
exercise
of
a
physical
superiority
the

had
collapsed
amid
the
astonished
outcries
of
its
thousands

victims
on
november
when
under
the
advice
and
with
the
assistance
of
ammon
its
organizer
per
cent
miller
had
fled
to
canada
it
was
nearly
four
years
later
in
june
that
ammon
arraigned
at
the
bar
of
justice
as
a
criminal
heard
assistant
district
attorney
nott
call
william
miller
convict
to
the
stand
to
testify
against
him
a
curious
contrast
they
presented
as
they
faced
one
another
the
emaciated
youth
of
the
hand
of
death
already
tightly
fastened
upon
his
meagre
frame
coughing
insignificant
almost
repulsive
who
dragged
himself
to
the
witness
chair
and
the
swaggering
athlete
who
glared
at
him
from
the
bar
surrounded
by
his
cordon
of
able
counsel
as
ammon
fixed
his
penetrating
gaze
upon
his
former
client
miller
turned
pale
and
dropped
his
eyes
then
the
prosecutor
realizing
the
danger
of
letting
the
old
hypnotic
power
return
even
for
an
instant
quickly
stepped
between
them
miller
raised
his
eyes
and
smiled
and
those
who
heard
knew
that
this
miserable
creature
had
been
through
the
fire
and
come
forth
to
speak
true
things
the
trial
of
ammon
involved
practically
the
reproving
of
the
case
against
miller
for
which
the
latter
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced
to
ten
years
in
state
prison
whence
he
now
issued
like
one
from
the
tomb
to
point
the
skeleton
incriminating
finger
at
his
betrayer
but
the
case
began
by
the
testifying
that
the
whole
business
was
a
miserable
fraud
from
start
to
finish
carried
on
and
guided
by
the
advice
of
the
defendant
he
told
how
he
a
mere
boy
of
burdened
with
a
sick
wife
and
baby
unfitted
by
training
or
ability
for
any
sort
of
lucrative
employment
a
of
bucket
shops
and
in
his
palmiest
days
a
speculator
in
tiny
lots
of
feebly
margined
stocks
finding
himself
without
means
of
support
conceived
the
alluring
idea
of
soliciting
funds
for
investment
promising
enormous
interest
and
paying
this
interest
out
of
the
principal
intrusted
to
him
for
a
time
he
preyed
only
upon
his
friends
claiming
inside
information
of
large
deals
and
paying
ten
per
cent
per
week
on
the
money
received
out
of
his
latest
deposits
surely
the
history
of
civilization
is
a
history
of
credulity
miller
prospered
his
earlier
who
had
hesitatingly
taken
his
receipt
for
ten
dollars
and
thereafter
had
received
one
dollar
every
monday
morning
repeated
the
operation
and
returned
in
numbers
from
having
his
office
in
his
hat
he
took
an
upper
room
in
a
small
house
at
floyd
street
brooklyn
an
humble
tenement
destined
to
be
the
scene
of
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
exhibitions
of
man
cupidity
and
foolishness
in
modern
times
at
first
he
had
tramped
round
like
a
pedler
delivering
the
dividends
himself
and
soliciting
more
but
soon
he
hired
a
boy
this
was
in
february
business
increased
the
golden
flood
began
to
appear
in
an
attenuated
but
constant
rivulet
he
hired
four
more
employees
and
the
whole
top
floor
of
the
house
the
golden
rivulet
became
a
steady
stream
from
a
panhandler
he
rolled
in
ready
thousands
the
future
opened
into
magnificent
auriferous
distances
he
began
to
call
himself
the
franklin
syndicate
and
to
advertise
that
the
way
to
wealth
is
as
plain
as
the
road
to
the
market
he
copied
the
real
brokers
and
scattered
circulars
and
weekly
letters
over
the
country
exciting
the
rural
mind
in
distant
manitoba
and
louisiana
there
was
an
instantaneous
response
his
mail
required
the
exclusive
attention
of
several
clerks
the
stream
of
gold
became
a
rushing
torrent
every
monday
morning
the
floyd
street
house
was
crowded
with
depositors
who
drew
their
interest
added
to
it
deposited
it
again
and
went
upon
their
way
rejoicing
nobody
was
going
to
have
to
work
any
more
the
customers
received
checks
for
their
interest
drawn
upon
the
franklin
syndicate
together
with
printed
receipts
for
their
deposits
all
signed
william
miller
by
means
of
a
rubber
stamp
no
human
hand
could
have
signed
them
all
without
writer
cramp
the
rubber
stamp
was
miller
official
signature
then
with
a
mighty
roar
the
torrent
burst
into
a
deluge
the
floyd
street
quarters
were
besieged
by
a
clamoring
multitude
fighting
to
see
which
of
them
could
give
up
his
money
first
and
there
had
to
be
a
special
delivery
for
miller
mail
he
rented
the
whole
house
and
hired
fifty
clerks
you
could
deposit
your
money
almost
anywhere
from
the
parlor
to
the
pantry
the
clothes
closet
or
the
fridays
the
public
stormed
the
house
since
the
money
must
be
deposited
that
to
draw
interest
for
the
following
week
the
crush
was
so
enormous
that
the
stoop
broke
down
imagine
it
in
quiet
brooklyn
people
struggling
to
get
up
the
steps
to
cram
their
money
into
miller
pockets
there
he
sat
behind
a
desk
at
the
top
of
the
stoop
solemnly
taking
the
money
thrown
down
before
him
and
handing
out
little
pink
and
green
stamped
receipts
in
exchange
there
was
no
place
to
put
the
money
so
it
was
shoved
on
to
the
floor
behind
him
friday
afternoons
miller
and
his
clerks
waded
through
it
knee
high
there
was
no
pretense
of
bookkeeping
simply
in
miller
issued
in
october
a
pronunciamento
that
he
could
not
in
justice
to
his
business
consent
to
receive
less
than
fifty
dollars
at
one
time
theoretically
there
was
no
reason
why
the
thing
should
not
have
gone
on
practically
forever
miller
and
everybody
else
becoming
richer
and
richer
so
long
as
the
golden
stream
swelled
five
times
each
year
everybody
would
be
happy
how
could
anybody
fail
to
be
happy
who
saw
so
much
money
lying
around
loose
everywhere
illustration
one
of
miller
franklin
syndicate
receipts
but
the
business
had
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
miller
began
to
distrust
his
own
capacity
to
handle
it
he
therefore
secured
a
partner
in
the
person
of
one
edward
schlessinger
and
with
him
went
to
charlestown
for
the
purpose
of
opening
another
office
in
charge
of
which
they
placed
a
man
named
louis
powers
history
repeated
itself
powers
shipped
the
deposits
to
miller
every
day
or
two
by
express
was
there
ever
such
a
plethora
of
easy
money
but
schlessinger
was
no
miller
he
decided
that
he
must
have
a
third
of
the
profits
heaven
knows
how
they
computed
them
and
have
them
moreover
each
day
hence
there
was
a
daily
accounting
part
of
the
receipts
being
laid
aside
to
pay
off
interest
checks
and
interest
and
the
balance
divided
schlessinger
carried
his
off
in
a
bag
miller
took
the
rest
cash
money
orders
and
checks
and
deposited
it
in
a
real
bank
how
the
money
poured
in
may
be
realized
from
the
fact
that
the
excess
of
receipts
over
disbursements
for
the
month
ending
november
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
dollars
hitherto
miller
had
been
the
central
figure
robert
ammon
now
became
the
ex
miller
advertising
had
become
so
extensive
that
he
had
been
forced
to
retain
a
professional
agent
one
rudolph
guenther
to
supervise
it
and
when
the
newspapers
began
to
make
unpleasant
comments
guenther
took
miller
to
ammon
office
in
the
bennett
building
in
nassau
street
ammon
accepted
a
hundred
dollars
from
miller
listened
to
his
account
of
the
business
and
examined
copies
of
the
circulars
when
he
was
handed
one
of
the
printed
receipts
he
said
they
were
incriminating
miller
must
try
to
get
them
back
he
advised
as
many
another
learned
counsellor
has
done
incorporating
the
business
since
by
this
means
stock
could
be
sold
and
exchanged
for
the
incriminating
receipts
he
explained
the
mistakes
of
the
crowd
but
showed
how
he
had
been
able
to
safeguard
them
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
foolishly
insisted
on
holding
the
stock
in
their
company
themselves
instead
of
making
their
customers
the
stockholders
nevertheless
you
do
not
see
any
of
the
dean
people
in
jail
boasted
ammon
from
now
on
miller
and
he
were
in
frequent
consultation
and
ammon
took
steps
to
incorporate
procuring
for
that
purpose
from
wells
fargo
a
certificate
of
deposit
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
occasionally
he
would
visit
floyd
street
to
see
how
things
were
going
miller
became
a
mere
puppet
ammon
twitched
the
wire
it
was
now
well
on
in
november
and
the
press
of
both
boston
and
new
york
was
filled
with
scathing
attacks
upon
the
syndicate
the
reporters
became
so
inquisitive
as
to
be
annoying
to
the
peaceful
miller
send
the
reporters
over
to
me
directed
ammon
the
of
boston
said
the
whole
thing
was
a
miserable
swindle
ammon
accompanied
by
miller
carrying
a
satchel
which
contained
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
greenbacks
went
to
boston
visited
the
offices
of
the
and
pitched
into
the
editor
the
business
is
all
right
you
must
give
us
a
fair
deal
the
pair
also
visited
watts
the
chief
of
police
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
said
ammon
to
miller
i
do
all
the
talking
he
showed
watts
the
bag
of
money
and
demanded
what
he
had
meant
by
calling
the
enterprise
a
green
goods
business
if
the
thing
was
all
right
did
watts
suppose
that
he
robert
ammon
would
be
connected
with
it
the
chief
backed
down
and
explained
that
he
had
jokingly
referred
to
the
color
of
one
of
the
receipts
which
happened
to
be
green
in
spite
of
ammon
confidence
however
there
was
an
uneasy
feeling
in
the
air
and
it
was
decided
to
put
an
advertisement
in
the
offering
to
allow
any
customer
who
so
desired
to
withdraw
his
deposit
upon
the
following
saturday
this
announcement
did
not
have
precisely
the
anticipated
effect
and
saturday
saw
a
large
crowd
of
victims
eager
to
withdraw
their
money
from
the
boston
office
of
the
franklin
syndicate
powers
paid
the
of
boston
out
of
the
bag
brought
on
by
miller
containing
the
deposits
of
the
of
brooklyn
meantime
ammon
addressed
the
throng
incidentally
blackguarding
a
reporter
before
the
crowd
telling
them
that
his
paper
was
a
yellow
paper
had
never
amounted
to
anything
and
never
would
some
timid
souls
took
courage
and
redeposited
their
money
the
run
continued
one
day
and
cost
ammon
and
miller
about
thousand
dollars
ammon
took
five
thousand
dollars
cash
as
a
fee
out
of
the
bag
and
the
pair
returned
to
new
york
but
confidence
had
been
temporarily
restored
the
beginning
of
the
end
however
was
now
in
sight
at
least
for
the
keen
vision
of
bob
ammon
he
advised
stimulating
deposits
and
laying
hands
on
all
the
money
possible
before
the
crash
came
accordingly
miller
sent
a
telegram
collect
to
all
depositors
we
have
inside
information
of
a
big
transaction
to
begin
saturday
or
monday
morning
big
profits
remit
at
once
so
as
to
receive
the
profits
william
miller
franklin
syndicate
a
thousand
or
so
were
returned
the
depositors
having
refused
to
pay
the
charges
the
rest
of
the
customers
in
large
measure
responded
but
the
game
was
nearly
up
there
were
in
the
papers
miller
saw
detectives
on
every
corner
and
like
a
rat
leaving
a
sinking
ship
schlessinger
scuttled
away
for
the
last
time
with
a
bag
of
money
on
the
evening
of
tuesday
november
the
rest
of
the
deposits
were
crammed
into
miller
desk
and
left
there
over
night
the
next
morning
miller
returned
to
floyd
street
and
spent
that
day
in
the
usual
routine
and
also
on
thursday
remained
until
about
twelve
noon
when
he
placed
thirty
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
in
bills
in
a
satchel
and
started
for
ammon
office
where
he
found
schlessinger
likewise
with
a
satchel
the
jig
up
announced
schlessinger
billy
i
think
you
have
to
make
a
run
for
it
said
ammon
the
best
thing
for
you
is
to
go
to
canada
it
still
remained
to
secure
the
money
which
miller
had
deposited
in
the
banks
in
such
a
way
that
the
customers
could
not
get
hold
of
it
ammon
explained
how
that
could
easily
be
done
the
money
should
be
all
turned
over
to
him
and
none
of
the
creditors
would
ever
see
it
again
he
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
suggest
that
neither
would
miller
accordingly
the
two
the
lawyer
and
the
client
went
to
the
office
of
wells
fargo
ammon
obligingly
carrying
the
satchel
containing
the
thirty
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
here
ammon
deposited
the
contents
to
his
own
account
as
well
as
the
certificate
of
deposit
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
previously
mentioned
and
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
representing
the
balance
of
miller
loot
in
addition
to
this
he
received
an
order
for
forty
thousand
dollars
united
states
government
bonds
which
were
on
deposit
with
wells
fargo
and
later
through
miller
father
thousand
dollars
in
bonds
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
and
the
united
states
government
thus
ammon
secured
from
his
dupe
the
sum
of
two
hundred
and
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
the
actual
market
value
of
the
securities
bringing
the
amount
up
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
besides
whatever
sums
he
had
been
paid
by
miller
for
legal
services
which
could
not
have
been
less
than
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
dollars
the
character
of
the
gentleman
is
well
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
later
when
paying
miller
her
miserable
pittance
of
five
dollars
per
week
he
explained
to
her
that
he
was
giving
her
that
out
of
his
own
money
and
that
her
husband
illustration
ammon
deposit
slips
and
a
receipt
signed
by
mrs
ammon
there
still
remained
however
the
chance
of
getting
a
few
dollars
more
and
ammon
advised
miller
to
try
to
get
friday
receipts
which
were
the
heaviest
day
business
acting
on
this
suggestion
miller
returned
to
floyd
street
the
next
morning
at
about
half
past
nine
finding
a
great
crowd
of
people
waiting
outside
about
one
he
started
to
go
home
but
discovering
that
he
was
being
followed
by
a
man
whom
he
took
to
be
a
detective
he
boarded
a
street
car
dodged
through
a
drug
store
and
a
chinese
laundry
finally
made
the
elevated
railroad
with
his
pursuer
at
his
heels
and
eventually
reached
the
office
about
two
in
the
afternoon
word
was
received
almost
immediately
over
the
telephone
that
miller
had
been
indicted
in
kings
county
for
conspiracy
to
defraud
and
ammon
stated
that
the
one
thing
for
miller
to
do
was
to
go
away
miller
replied
that
he
did
not
want
to
go
unless
he
could
take
his
wife
and
baby
with
him
but
ammon
assured
him
that
he
would
send
them
to
canada
later
in
charge
of
his
own
wife
under
this
promise
miller
agreed
to
go
and
ammon
procured
a
man
named
enright
to
take
miller
to
canada
saying
that
he
was
an
and
could
get
him
out
of
the
way
ammon
further
promised
to
forward
to
miller
whatever
money
he
might
need
to
retain
lawyers
for
him
in
montreal
thereupon
miller
exchanged
hats
with
some
one
in
office
and
started
for
canada
in
the
custody
of
the
representative
how
the
wily
colonel
must
have
chuckled
as
poor
miller
trotted
down
the
stairs
like
a
sheep
leaving
his
fleece
behind
him
a
golden
fleece
indeed
did
ever
a
lawyer
have
such
a
piece
of
luck
here
was
a
little
fellow
who
had
invented
a
brilliant
scheme
to
get
away
with
other
people
money
and
had
carried
it
through
successfully
more
than
successfully
beyond
the
dreams
of
even
the
most
avaricious
criminal
and
then
richer
than
midas
had
handed
over
the
whole
jolly
fortune
to
another
for
the
other
asking
without
even
taking
a
scrap
of
paper
to
show
for
it
more
than
that
he
had
then
voluntarily
extinguished
himself
had
ammon
not
chuckled
he
would
not
have
been
bob
ammon
the
money
was
stolen
to
be
sure
but
ammon
skirts
were
clear
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
the
two
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
he
had
received
was
stolen
money
there
was
only
one
man
a
discredited
felon
who
could
hint
that
the
money
was
even
tainted
and
was
safely
over
the
border
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
not
in
the
custody
of
the
police
but
of
ammon
himself
to
be
kept
there
as
robert
taylor
so
aptly
phrased
it
in
arguing
ammon
case
on
appeal
on
waiting
orders
ammon
had
miller
on
a
string
and
as
soon
as
ammon
for
his
own
sake
was
compelled
either
to
produce
miller
or
to
run
the
risk
of
indictment
he
pulled
the
string
and
brought
miller
back
into
the
jurisdiction
needless
to
say
great
was
the
ado
made
over
the
disappearance
of
the
promoter
of
the
franklin
syndicate
and
the
authorities
of
king
county
speedily
let
it
become
known
that
justice
required
that
some
one
should
be
punished
for
the
colossal
fraud
which
had
been
perpetrated
the
grand
jury
of
the
county
started
a
general
investigation
public
indignation
was
stirred
to
the
point
of
ebullition
in
the
midst
of
the
rumpus
there
came
a
knock
on
the
office
door
of
the
hon
john
clark
district
attorney
of
king
county
and
robert
ammon
announced
himself
the
two
men
were
entire
strangers
to
each
other
but
this
did
not
prevent
ammon
with
his
inimitable
assurance
from
addressing
the
district
attorney
by
his
first
name
how
are
you
john
he
inquired
nonchalantly
what
can
i
do
for
you
clark
repressed
his
natural
inclination
to
kick
the
insolent
fellow
forcibly
out
of
his
office
invited
him
to
be
seated
and
rang
for
a
stenographer
ammon
asserted
his
anxiety
to
assist
the
district
attorney
by
every
means
in
his
power
but
denied
knowing
the
whereabouts
of
miller
alleging
that
he
was
simply
acting
as
his
counsel
clark
replied
that
in
miller
absence
the
grand
jury
might
take
the
view
that
ammon
himself
was
the
principal
at
this
ammon
calmly
assured
his
host
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
was
ready
to
go
before
the
grand
jury
at
any
time
that
is
just
what
i
want
returned
clark
the
grand
jury
is
in
session
come
over
ammon
arose
with
a
smile
and
accompanied
the
district
attorney
towards
the
door
of
the
grand
jury
room
just
outside
he
suddenly
placed
his
hand
to
his
head
as
if
recollecting
something
one
moment
he
exclaimed
i
forgot
that
i
have
an
engagement
i
will
come
over
ah
retorted
clark
i
do
not
think
you
will
be
here
two
weeks
later
miller
was
safely
ensconced
without
bail
in
raymond
street
jail
schlessinger
who
got
away
with
one
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
in
cash
fled
to
europe
where
he
lived
high
frequenting
the
race
tracks
and
gaming
tables
until
he
was
called
to
his
final
account
a
year
or
two
ago
the
money
which
he
took
has
never
been
traced
miller
was
tried
convicted
and
sent
to
sing
sing
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
then
reversed
his
conviction
but
later
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
sustained
of
the
enormous
sums
turned
over
to
ammon
miller
received
nothing
save
the
money
necessary
for
his
support
in
montreal
for
the
lawyers
who
defended
him
and
five
dollars
per
week
for
his
wife
and
child
up
to
the
time
he
turned
state
evidence
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
among
the
counsel
representing
miller
upon
his
trial
was
ammon
himself
miller
wife
and
child
were
not
sent
to
montreal
by
ammon
nor
did
the
latter
secure
bail
for
his
client
at
any
time
during
his
different
periods
of
incarceration
the
colonel
knew
very
well
that
it
was
a
choice
between
himself
and
miller
and
took
no
steps
which
might
necessitate
the
election
falling
upon
himself
the
conviction
of
miller
with
his
sentence
to
ten
years
in
prison
did
not
however
prevent
the
indictment
of
ammon
for
receiving
stolen
money
in
new
york
county
although
the
chance
that
he
would
ever
have
to
suffer
for
his
crime
seemed
small
indeed
the
reader
must
bear
in
mind
that
up
to
the
time
of
ammon
trial
miller
had
never
admitted
his
guilt
that
he
was
still
absolutely
and
apparently
irrevocably
under
ammon
sinister
influence
keeping
in
constant
communication
with
him
and
implicitly
obeying
his
instructions
while
in
prison
and
that
miller
wife
and
child
were
dependent
upon
ammon
for
their
daily
bread
no
wonder
ammon
strode
the
streets
confident
that
his
creature
would
never
betray
him
now
billy
you
do
want
to
be
shooting
off
your
mouth
up
here
was
his
parting
injunction
to
his
dupe
on
his
final
visit
to
sing
sing
before
he
became
a
guest
there
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
people
miller
followed
his
orders
to
the
letter
and
the
stipend
was
increased
to
the
munificent
sum
of
forty
dollars
per
month
meantime
the
case
against
ammon
languished
and
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
was
at
his
wits
end
to
devise
a
means
to
procure
the
evidence
to
convict
him
to
do
this
it
would
be
necessary
to
establish
affirmatively
that
the
thirty
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
received
by
ammon
from
miller
and
deposited
with
wells
fargo
was
the
money
stolen
by
miller
from
the
victims
of
the
franklin
syndicate
it
was
easy
enough
to
prove
that
miller
stole
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
that
ammon
received
hundreds
of
thousands
but
you
had
to
prove
that
the
same
money
stolen
by
miller
passed
to
the
hands
of
ammon
only
one
man
in
the
world
as
ammon
had
foreseen
could
supply
this
last
necessary
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
and
he
was
a
convict
and
mute
it
now
became
the
task
of
the
district
attorney
to
induce
miller
to
confess
the
truth
and
take
the
stand
against
ammon
he
had
been
in
prison
a
considerable
time
and
his
health
was
such
as
to
necessitate
his
being
transferred
to
the
hospital
ward
several
of
the
district
attorney
assistants
visited
him
at
various
times
at
sing
sing
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
persuade
him
to
turn
state
evidence
but
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
miller
refused
absolutely
to
say
anything
that
would
tend
to
implicate
ammon
at
last
the
district
attorney
himself
accompanied
by
nott
who
later
prosecuted
ammon
made
a
special
trip
to
sing
sing
to
see
what
could
be
done
they
found
miller
lying
upon
his
prison
pallet
his
harsh
cough
and
blazing
eyes
speaking
only
too
patently
of
his
condition
at
first
nott
tried
to
engage
him
in
conversation
while
the
district
attorney
occupied
himself
with
other
business
in
another
part
of
the
ward
but
it
was
easily
apparent
that
miller
would
say
nothing
the
district
attorney
then
approached
the
bed
where
miller
was
lying
and
inquired
if
it
were
true
that
he
declined
to
say
anything
which
might
tend
to
incriminate
ammon
after
some
hesitation
miller
replied
that
even
if
he
should
testify
against
his
old
accomplice
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
he
would
be
pardoned
and
that
he
would
not
talk
unless
he
had
actually
in
his
hands
some
paper
or
writing
which
would
guarantee
that
if
he
did
so
he
would
be
set
free
the
spectacle
of
a
convicted
felon
haggling
with
an
officer
of
the
law
over
the
terms
upon
which
he
would
consent
to
avail
himself
of
an
opportunity
to
make
the
only
reparation
still
possible
angered
the
district
attorney
and
turning
fiercely
upon
the
prisoner
he
arraigned
him
in
scathing
terms
stating
that
he
was
a
miserable
swindler
and
thief
who
had
robbed
thousands
of
poor
people
of
all
the
money
they
had
in
the
world
that
he
showed
himself
devoid
of
every
spark
of
decency
or
repentance
by
refusing
to
assist
the
law
in
punishing
his
confederate
and
assisting
his
victims
in
getting
back
what
was
left
of
the
money
and
that
he
the
district
attorney
felt
himself
humiliated
in
having
consented
to
come
there
to
visit
and
talk
with
such
a
heartless
and
depraved
specimen
of
humanity
the
district
attorney
then
turned
his
back
upon
miller
whose
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
who
made
no
response
a
few
moments
later
the
convict
asked
permission
to
speak
to
the
district
attorney
alone
with
some
reluctance
the
latter
granted
the
request
and
the
others
drew
away
district
attorney
said
the
wretched
man
in
a
trembling
voice
with
the
tears
still
suffusing
his
eyes
i
a
thief
i
did
rob
all
those
poor
people
and
i
am
heartily
sorry
for
it
i
would
gladly
die
if
by
doing
so
i
could
pay
them
back
but
i
have
a
single
cent
of
all
the
money
that
i
stole
and
the
only
thing
that
stands
between
my
wife
and
baby
and
starvation
is
my
keeping
silence
if
i
did
what
you
ask
the
only
money
they
have
to
live
on
would
be
stopped
i
ca
see
them
starve
glad
as
i
would
be
to
do
what
i
can
now
to
make
up
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
the
district
attorney
own
eyes
were
not
entirely
dry
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
miller
miller
he
replied
i
have
done
you
a
great
injustice
i
honor
you
for
the
position
you
have
taken
were
i
in
your
place
i
should
probably
act
exactly
as
you
are
doing
i
can
not
promise
you
a
pardon
if
you
testify
against
ammon
i
can
not
even
promise
that
your
wife
will
receive
forty
dollars
a
month
for
the
money
in
my
charge
can
not
be
used
for
such
a
purpose
all
i
can
assure
you
of
is
that
should
you
decide
to
help
me
a
full
and
fair
statement
of
all
you
may
have
done
will
be
sent
to
the
governor
with
a
request
that
he
act
favorably
upon
any
application
for
a
pardon
which
you
may
make
the
choice
must
be
your
own
whatever
you
decide
to
do
you
have
my
respect
and
sympathy
think
well
over
the
matter
do
not
decide
at
once
wait
for
a
day
or
two
and
i
will
return
to
new
york
and
you
can
send
me
word
the
next
day
miller
sent
word
that
he
had
determined
to
tell
the
truth
and
take
the
stand
whatever
the
consequences
to
himself
and
his
family
might
be
he
was
immediately
transferred
to
the
tombs
prison
in
new
york
city
where
he
made
a
complete
and
full
confession
not
only
assisting
in
every
way
in
securing
evidence
for
the
prosecution
of
ammon
but
aiding
his
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
determine
the
whereabouts
of
some
sixty
thousand
dollars
of
the
stolen
money
which
but
for
him
would
never
have
been
recovered
at
the
same
time
ammon
was
upon
a
bench
warrant
and
his
bail
sufficiently
increased
to
render
his
appearance
for
trial
probable
as
miller
had
foreseen
the
monthly
payment
to
his
wife
instantly
stopped
the
usual
effect
produced
upon
a
jury
by
the
testimony
of
a
convict
accomplice
is
one
of
distrust
or
open
incredulity
every
word
of
miller
story
however
carried
with
it
the
impression
of
absolute
truth
as
he
proceeded
in
spite
of
the
sneers
of
the
defence
an
extraordinary
wave
of
sympathy
for
the
man
swept
over
the
and
the
jury
listened
with
close
attention
to
his
graphic
account
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
outrageous
conspiracy
which
had
attempted
to
shield
its
alluring
offer
of
instant
wealth
behind
the
name
of
america
most
practical
philosopher
whose
only
receipt
for
the
same
end
had
been
frugality
and
industry
supported
as
miller
was
by
the
corroborative
testimony
of
other
witnesses
and
by
the
certificates
of
deposit
which
ammon
had
with
his
customary
bravado
made
out
in
his
own
handwriting
no
room
was
left
for
even
the
slightest
doubt
not
only
that
the
money
had
been
stolen
but
that
ammon
had
received
it
indeed
so
plain
was
the
proposition
that
the
defence
never
for
an
instant
contemplated
the
possibility
of
putting
ammon
upon
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf
it
was
in
truth
an
extraordinary
case
for
the
principal
element
in
the
proof
was
made
out
by
the
evidence
of
the
thief
himself
that
he
was
a
thief
miller
had
been
tried
and
convicted
of
the
very
larceny
to
which
he
now
testified
and
although
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
no
principle
of
could
apply
in
ammon
case
it
was
a
logical
conclusion
that
if
the
evidence
upon
the
first
trial
was
repeated
the
necessary
element
of
larceny
would
be
effectually
established
hence
in
point
of
fact
miller
testimony
upon
the
question
of
whether
the
money
had
been
was
entirely
unnecessary
and
the
efforts
of
the
defence
were
directed
simply
to
making
out
miller
such
a
miscreant
upon
his
own
testimony
that
perforce
the
jury
could
not
accept
his
evidence
when
it
reached
the
point
of
implicating
ammon
all
their
attempts
in
this
direction
however
only
roused
increased
sympathy
for
the
witness
and
hostility
toward
their
own
client
and
made
the
jury
the
more
ready
to
believe
that
ammon
had
been
the
only
one
in
the
end
to
profit
by
the
transaction
briefly
the
two
points
urged
by
the
defence
were
that
ammon
was
acting
only
as
miller
counsel
and
hence
was
immune
and
that
there
was
no
adequate
legal
evidence
that
the
thirty
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
which
ammon
had
deposited
as
shown
by
the
deposit
slip
was
the
identical
money
stolen
from
the
victims
of
the
franklin
syndicate
as
bearing
upon
this
they
urged
that
the
stolen
money
had
in
fact
been
deposited
by
miller
himself
and
so
had
lost
the
character
of
stolen
money
before
it
was
turned
over
to
the
defendant
and
that
miller
story
being
that
of
an
accomplice
required
absolute
corroboration
in
every
detail
the
point
that
ammon
was
acting
only
as
a
lawyer
was
quickly
disposed
of
by
judge
newburger
something
has
been
said
by
counsel
he
remarked
in
his
charge
to
the
jury
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
as
a
lawyer
had
a
perfect
right
to
advise
miller
but
i
know
of
no
rule
of
law
that
will
permit
counsel
to
advise
how
a
crime
can
be
committed
as
to
the
identity
of
the
money
the
court
charged
that
it
made
no
difference
which
person
performed
the
physical
act
of
placing
the
cash
in
the
hands
of
the
receiving
teller
of
the
bank
so
long
as
it
was
deposited
to
ammon
credit
on
the
question
of
what
corroboration
of
miller
story
was
necessary
judge
ingraham
in
the
appellate
division
expressed
great
doubt
as
to
whether
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
miller
the
thief
could
be
regarded
as
an
accomplice
of
ammon
in
receiving
the
stolen
money
at
all
and
stated
that
even
if
he
could
be
so
regarded
there
was
more
than
abundant
corroboration
of
his
testimony
ammon
conviction
was
affirmed
throughout
the
courts
including
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
defendant
himself
is
now
engaged
in
serving
out
his
necessarily
inadequate
sentence
necessarily
inadequate
since
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
the
receiver
of
stolen
goods
however
great
his
moral
obliquity
may
be
and
however
great
the
amount
stolen
can
only
receive
half
the
punishment
which
may
be
meted
out
to
the
thief
himself
receiving
being
punishable
by
only
five
years
or
less
in
state
prison
while
grand
larceny
is
punishable
by
ten
years
yet
who
was
the
greater
criminal
the
weak
ignorant
clerk
or
the
shrewd
experienced
lawyer
who
preyed
upon
his
client
and
through
him
upon
the
community
at
large
the
confession
of
miller
in
the
face
of
what
the
consequences
of
his
course
might
mean
to
his
wife
and
child
was
an
act
of
moral
courage
the
price
he
had
to
pay
is
known
to
himself
alone
but
the
horrors
of
life
in
prison
for
the
squealer
were
thoroughly
familiar
to
him
when
he
elected
to
do
what
he
could
to
atone
for
his
crime
in
fact
ammon
had
not
neglected
to
picture
them
vividly
to
him
and
to
stigmatize
an
erstwhile
client
of
his
everything
looks
good
he
wrote
to
miller
in
sing
sing
in
reporting
the
affirmance
of
goslin
conviction
especially
since
the
is
getting
his
just
with
no
certain
knowledge
of
a
future
pardon
miller
went
back
to
prison
cheerfully
to
face
all
the
nameless
tortures
inflicted
upon
those
who
help
the
state
the
absolute
black
silence
of
convict
excommunication
the
blows
and
kicks
inflicted
without
opportunity
for
retaliation
or
complaint
the
hostility
of
guards
and
keepers
the
suffering
of
abject
poverty
keener
in
a
prison
house
than
on
any
other
foot
of
earth
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
miller
original
purpose
had
been
to
secure
money
to
speculate
with
for
he
had
been
bitten
deep

to

margin
he
set
out

when

it
was

asking

dropped

he
is

allowed
his
little
boy
to
have
the

then
discovered
that

bore

of
petty
larceny

may
have

million
worth
of
negotiable
securities
and
even
encourage
the
latter
by
occasional
sure
tips
to
take

flyer
in

market
it
is
a
deplorable
fact
that
the
officers
of
certain
companies
occasionally
unload
undesirable
securities
upon
their
employees
and
in

to
boom
or
create
a
movement
in
a
certain
stock
will
induce
the
persons
under
their
control
to
purchase
it
it
would
be
a
rare
case
in
which
a
clerk
who
valued
his
situation
would
refuse
to
take
a
few
shares
in
an
enterprise
which
the
head
of
the
firm
was
fathering
of
course
such
occurrences
are
the
exceptions
but
there
are
plenty
of
houses
not
far
from
wall
street
where
the
partners
know
that
their
clerks
and
messengers
are
playing
the
market
and
exert
not
the
slightest
influence
to
stop
them
when
these
men
find
that
they
and
their
customers
and
not
the
clerks
and
messengers
are
paying
the
loss
accounts
of
the
latter
they
are
very
much
distressed
and
tell
the
district
attorney
with
regret
that
only
by
sending
such
wicked
and
treacherous
persons
to
state
prison
can
similar
dishonesty
be
prevented
not
long
ago
the
writer
became
acquainted
with
a
young
man
who
as
loan
clerk
in
a
trust
company
had
misappropriated
a
large
amount
of
securities
and
had
pleaded
guilty
to
the
crime
of
grand
larceny
in
the
first
degree
he
was
awaiting
sentence
and
in
connection
therewith
it
became
necessary
to
examine
into
the
conditions
prevailing
generally
in
the
financial
district
his
story
is
already
public
property
for
the
case
attracted
wide
attention
in
the
daily
press
but
inasmuch
as
the
writer
object
is
to
point
a
moral
rather
than
adorn
a
tale
the
culprit
name
and
the
name
of
the
company
with
which
he
was
connected
need
not
be
given
he
is
now
serving
a
term
in
state
prison
and
is
the
writer
believes
sincerely
repentant
and
determined
to
make
a
man
of
himself
upon
his
release
for
present
purposes
let
him
be
called
john
smith
he
was
born
in
new
york
city
in
surroundings
rather
better
than
the
average
his
family
were
persons
of
good
education
and
his
home
was
a
comfortable
and
happy
one
from
childhood
he
received
thorough
religious
instruction
and
was
always
a
straightforward
honest
and
obedient
boy
his
father
having
concluded
from
observation
that
the
shortest
route
to
success
lay
in
financial
enterprise
secured
a
place
in
a
broker
office
for
his
son
after
the
latter
graduation
from
the
high
school
john
began
at
the
bottom
and
gradually
worked
up
to
the
position
of
assistant
loan
clerk
in
a
big
trust
company
this
took
fifteen
years
of
hard
work
from
the
day
that
he
started
in
filling
inkwells
and
cleaning
out
ticker
baskets
he
saw
fortunes
made
and
lost
in
a
twinkling
he
learned
that
the
chief
business
of
a
broker
is
acting
as
for
persons
who
are
trying
to
sell
what
they
do
not
own
to
others
who
have
not
the
money
to
pay
for
what
they
buy
and
he
saw
hundreds
of
such
persons
grow
rich
on
these
fictitious
transactions
he
also
saw
others
wiped
out
but
they
cheerfully
went
through
bankruptcy
and
began
again
many
of
them
achieving
wealth
on
their
second
or
third
attempt
he
was
earning
five
dollars
a
week
and
getting
his
lunch
at
a
vegetarian
health
restaurant
for
fifteen
cents
the
broker
for
whom
he
ran
errands
gave
away
cigars
to
his
customers
and
had
an
elaborate
luncheon
served
in
the
office
daily
to
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
elect
john
knew
one
boy
of
about
his
own
age
who
having
made
a
successful
turn
began
as
a
trader
and
cleaned
up
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
a
rising
market
the
first
year
that
was
better
than
the
cleaning
up
john
was
used
to
but
he
was
a
sensible
boy
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
succeed
in
a
legitimate
fashion
gradually
he
saved
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
acting
on
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
in
his
business
bought
two
or
three
shares
in
a
security
which
quickly
advanced
in
value
and
almost
doubled
his
money
the
next
time
as
well
fortune
favored
him
and
he
soon
had
a
comfortable
enough
to
warrant
his
feeling
reasonably
secure
in
the
event
of
accident
or
sickness
he
had
worked
faithfully
had
given
great
satisfaction
to
his
employers
and
presently
had
a
clerical
position
in
a
prominent
trust
company
offered
to
him
it
seemed
an
advance
the
salary
was
larger
even
if
absurdly
small
and
he
gladly
accepted
the
place
shortly
after
this
he
had
his
first
experience
in
real
finance
the
president
of
the
company
sent
for
him
the
reader
will
remember
that
this
is
a
true
story
and
the
boy
entered
his
private
office
and
came
into
the
august
presence
of
the
magnate
this
man
is
what
is
commonly
known
as
a
power
in
wall
street
my
boy
said
the
president
you
have
been
doing
very
well
i
have
noticed
the
excellence
of
your
work
i
want
to
commend
you
thank
you
sir
said
john
modestly
expecting
to
hear
that
his
salary
was
to
be
raised
yes
continued
the
great
man
and
i
want
you
to
have
an
interest
in
the
business
the
blood
rushed
to
john
head
and
face
thank
you
very
much
he
gasped
i
have
allotted
you
five
shares
in
the
trust
company
said
the
president
if
you
take
them
up
and
carry
them
you
will
feel
that
you
have
a
real
connection
with
the
house
and
it
will
net
you
a
handsome
return
have
you
any
money
it
so
happened
that
at
this
time
john
savings
were
invested
in
a
few
bonds
of
an
old
and
conservatively
managed
railroad
his
heart
fell
he
did
want
to
buy
any
bank
stock
no
he
answered
my
salary
is
small
enough
and
i
need
it
all
i
save
any
money
oh
well
said
the
magnate
i
will
try
and
fix
it
up
for
you
i
will
arrange
for
a
loan
with
the
bank
on
the
stock
remember
i
doing
this
to
help
you
that
is
all
you
may
go
back
to
your
books
next
day
john
was
informed
that
he
had
bought
five
shares
of
trust
company
stock
in
the
neighborhood
of
three
hundred
and
he
signed
a
note
for
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
dollars
and
indorsed
the
stock
over
to
the
bank
from
which
the
money
had
been
borrowed
for
him
the
stock
almost
immediately
dropped
over
fifty
points
john
paid
the
interest
on
the
note
out
of
his
salary
and
the
dividends
as
fast
as
they
were
declared
went
to
extinguish
the
body
of
the
loan
some
time
afterward
he
learned
that
he
had
bought
the
stock
from
the
magnate
himself
he
never
received
any
benefit
from
it
for
the
stock
was
sold
to
cover
the
note
and
john
was
obliged
to
make
up
the
difference
he
also
discovered
that
ten
or
fifteen
other
employees
had
been
given
a
similar
opportunity
by
their
generous
employer
at
about
the
same
time
john
in
prison
says
it
was
a
scheme
to
keep
fifty
or
a
hundred
shares
where
it
could
easily
be
controlled
by
the
president
without
risk
to
himself
in
case
of
need
of
course
he
may
be
wrong
at
any
rate
he
feels
bitterly
now
toward
the
big
men
who
are
at
large
while
he
is
in
jail
john
continued
to
keep
up
with
the
acquaintances
formed
during
his
years
in
the
broker
office
many
of
whom
had
started
little
businesses
of
their
own
and
had
done
well
part
of
their
was
to
appear
prosperous
and
they
took
john
out
to
lunch
and
told
him
what
a
fine
fellow
he
was
and
gave
him
sure
tips
but
john
had
grown
wise
he
had
had
all
the
chances
of
that
sort
he
wanted
and
from
a
bigger
man
than
any
of
them
he
ate
their
lunches
and
invited
them
in
return
then
he
economized
for
a
day
or
two
to
even
up
he
was
not
prosperous
himself
but
he
did
not
accept
favors
without
repaying
them
one
thing
he
observed
and
noted
carefully
every
man
he
knew
who
had
begun
a
brokerage
business
and
kept
sober
who
attended
to
business
and
did
not
speculate
made
money
and
plenty
of
it
he
knew
one
young
firm
which
cleared
up
fifteen
thousand
in
commissions
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
that
looked
good
to
him
and
he
knew
besides
that
was
sober
and
attended
to
business
he
made
inquiries
and
learned
that
one
could
start
in
if
one
were
modest
in
one
pretensions
for
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
that
would
pay
office
rent
and
keep
things
going
until
the
commissions
began
to
come
in
he
started
to
look
around
for
some
other
young
man
who
could
put
up
the
money
in
consideration
of
john
contributing
the
experience
but
all
the
men
he
knew
had
experience
without
money
then
by
chance
he
met
a
young
fellow
of
bright
and
agreeable
personality
whom
we
shall
call
prescott
the
latter
was
five
or
six
years
older
than
john
had
had
a
large
experience
in
brokerage
houses
in
another
city
and
had
come
to
new
york
to
promote
the
interests
of
a
certain
copper
company
john
had
progressed
and
was
now
assistant
loan
clerk
of
one
of
the
biggest
trust
companies
in
the
city
which
also
happened
to
be
transfer
agent
for
the
copper
company
thus
john
had
constantly
to
handle
its
certificates
prescott
said
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
that
some
of
the
keenest
men
in
the
street
were
in
it
and
although
it
was
a
curb
stock
strongly
advised
his
new
friend
to
buy
all
he
could
of
it
he
assured
john
that
although
he
was
admittedly
interested
in
booming
the
stock
he
was
confident
that
before
long
it
would
sell
at
four
times
its
present
quotation
meantime
the
stock
which
had
been
listed
at
began
to
go
rapidly
up
word
went
around
the
trust
company
that
it
was
a
great
purchase
anywhere
below
and
john
as
well
as
the
other
boys
employed
in
the
company
got
together
what
money
he
could
and
began
to
buy
it
it
continued
to
go
up
they
had
unconsciously
assisted
it
in
its
ascent
and
they
bought
more
john
purchased
shares
all
the
way
up
to
and
one
of
his
friends
took
eight
hundred
then
it
dropped
out
of
sight
they
had
time
to
get
out
and
john
in
prison
has
his
yet
but
he
still
had
faith
in
prescott
for
he
liked
him
and
believed
in
his
business
capacity
the
stock
operation
over
prescott
began
to
prospect
for
something
new
and
suggested
to
john
that
they
form
a
brokerage
house
under
the
latter
name
john
was
to
be
president
at
a
fixed
salary
it
sounded
very
grand
his
duties
at
the
trust
company
began
to
seem
picayune
moreover
his
loss
in
copper
had
depressed
him
and
he
wanted
to
recoup
if
he
could
but
how
to
get
the
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
necessary
to
start
in
business
prescott
pleaded
poverty
yet
talked
constantly
of
the
ease
with
which
a
fortune
might
be
made
if
they
could
only
once
get
in
right
it
was
a
period
of
increased
dividends
of
operations
of
enormous
magnitude
of
movements
when
the
lucky
purchaser
of
only
a
hundred
shares
of
some
inconspicuous
railroad
sometimes
found
that
he
could
sell
out
next
week
with
five
thousand
dollars
profit
the
air
seemed
full
of
money
it
appeared
to
rain
banknotes
and
stock
certificates
in
the
loan
cage
at
the
trust
company
john
handled
daily
millions
in
securities
a
great
part
of
which
were
negotiable
when
almost
everybody
was
so
rich
he
wondered
why
any
one
remained
poor
two
or
three
men
of
his
own
age
gave
up
their
jobs
in
other
concerns
and
became
traders
while
another
opened
an
office
of
his
own
john
was
told
that
they
had
acted
on
good
information
had
bought
a
few
hundred
shares
of
union
pacific
and
were
now
comfortably
fixed
he
would
have
been
glad
to
buy
but
copper
had
left
him
without
anything
to
buy
with
one
day
prescott
took
him
out
to
lunch
and
confided
to
him
that
one
of
the
big
speculators
had
tipped
him
off
to
buy
cotton
since
there
was
going
to
be
a
failure
in
the
crop
it
was
practically
a
sure
thing
two
thousand
dollars
margin
would
buy
enough
cotton
to
start
them
in
business
even
if
the
rise
was
only
a
very
small
one
why
do
you
borrow
a
couple
of
bonds
asked
prescott
borrow
from
whom
inquired
john
why
from
some
customer
of
the
trust
company
no
one
would
lend
them
to
me
answered
john
well
borrow
them
anyhow
they
would
never
know
about
it
and
you
could
put
them
back
as
soon
as
we
closed
the
account
suggested
prescott
john
was
shocked
and
said
so
you
are
easy
said
his
comrade
do
you
know
that
the
trust
companies
do
it
themselves
all
the
time
the
presidents
of
the
railroads
use
the
holdings
of
their
companies
as
collateral
even
the
banks
use
their
deposits
for
trading
did
old
dump
a
lot
of
rotten
stuff
on
you
why
do
you
get
even
let
me
tell
you
something
fully
of
the
men
who
are
now
successful
financiers
got
their
start
by
putting
up
as
margin
securities
deposited
with
them
no
one
ever
knew
the
difference
and
now
they
are
on
their
feet
if
you
took
two
bonds
overnight
you
might
put
them
back
in
the
morning
every
one
does
it
it
part
of
the
game
but
suppose
we
lost
asked
john
you
ca
said
prescott
cotton
is
sure
to
go
up
it
throwing
away
the
chance
of
your
life
john
said
he
could
do
such
a
thing
but
when
he
returned
to
the
office
the
cashier
told
him
that
a
merger
had
been
planned
between
their
company
and
another
a
larger
one
john
knew
what
that
meant
well
enough
half
the
clerks
would
lose
their
positions
he
was
getting
dollars
a
week
had
married
a
young
wife
and
as
he
had
told
the
magnate
he
needed
it
all
that
night
as
he
put
the
securities
from
the
loan
cage
back
in
the
vault
the
bonds
burned
his
fingers
they
were
lying
around
loose
no
good
to
anybody
and
only
two
of
them
overnight
maybe
would
make
him
independent
of
salaries
and
mergers
a
free
man
and
his
own
master
the
vault
was
in
the
basement
just
below
the
loan
cage
it
was
some
twenty
feet
long
and
ten
wide
there
were
three
tiers
of
boxes
with
double
combination
doors
in
the
extreme
corner
was
the
loan
box
near
it
were
two
other
boxes
in
which
the
securities
of
certain
customers
on
deposit
were
kept
john
had
individual
access
to
the
loan
box
and
the
two
others
one
of
which
contained
the
collateral
which
secured
loans
that
were
practically
permanent
he
thus
had
within
his
control
negotiable
bonds
of
over
a
million
dollars
in
value
the
securities
were
in
piles
strapped
with
rubber
bands
and
bore
slips
on
which
were
written
the
names
of
the
owners
every
morning
john
carried
up
all
these
piles
to
the
loan
cage
except
the
securities
on
deposit
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
carried
all
back
himself
and
tossed
them
into
the
boxes
when
the
interest
coupons
on
the
deposited
bonds
had
to
be
cut
he
carried
these
also
upstairs
at
night
the
vault
was
secured
by
two
doors
one
with
a
combination
lock
and
the
other
with
a
time
lock
it
was
as
safe
as
human
ingenuity
could
make
it
by
day
it
had
only
a
gate
which
could
be
opened
with
a
key
no
attendant
was
stationed
at
the
door
if
john
wanted
to
get
in
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
ask
the
person
who
had
the
key
to
open
it
the
reason
john
had
the
combination
to
these
different
boxes
was
in
order
to
save
the
loan
clerk
the
trouble
of
going
downstairs
to
get
the
collateral
himself
next
day
when
john
went
out
to
lunch
he
put
two
bonds
belonging
to
a
customer
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
intend
to
steal
them
or
even
to
borrow
them
it
was
done
almost
automatically
his
will
seemed
subjugated
to
the
idea
that
they
were
to
all
intents
and
purposes
bonds
to
do
as
he
liked
with
he
wanted
the
feeling
of
as
he
walked
along
the
street
to
the
restaurant
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
they
should
be
there
they
were
nearly
as
safe
with
him
as
lying
around
loose
in
the
cage
or
chucked
into
a
box
in
the
vault
prescott
joined
him
full
of
his
new
idea
that
cotton
was
going
to
jump
overnight
if
you
only
had
a
couple
of
bonds
he
sighed
then
somehow
john
legs
and
arms
grew
weak
he
seemed
to
disintegrate
internally
he
tried
to
pull
himself
together
but
he
had
lost
control
of
his
muscles
he
became
a
dual
personality
his
own
john
heard
prescott
john
say
quite
naturally
i
can
let
you
have
two
bonds
but
mind
we
get
them
back
or
anyhow
the
day
after
john
john
felt
the
other
john
slip
the
two
american
navigation
under
the
table
and
prescott
fingers
close
upon
them
then
came
a
period
of
hypnotic
paralysis
the
flywheel
of
his
hung
on
a
dead
centre
almost
instantly
he
became
himself
again
give
back
he
whispered
hoarsely
i
did
mean
you
should
keep
them
and
he
reached
anxiously
across
the
table
but
prescott
was
on
his
feet
toward
the
door
do
be
a
fool
smith
he
laughed
what
the
matter
with
you
a
cinch
go
back
and
forget
it
he
shot
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
street
john
followed
dazed
and
trembling
with
horror
at
what
he
had
done
he
went
back
to
the
cage
and
remained
the
rest
of
the
day
in
terror
lest
the
broker
who
owned
the
two
bonds
should
pay
off
his
loan
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
quickly
made
up
his
mind
what
he
should
do
in
that
event
there
was
more
than
one
loan
secured
by
american
navigation
he
loosened
a
couple
in
one
of
the
other
piles
if
the
first
broker
came
in
he
would
take
two
bonds
from
one
of
these
but
the
broker
did
not
come
in
that
night
john
wandered
the
streets
till
nearly
daylight
he
saw
himself
arrested
ruined
in
prison
utterly
fagged
next
morning
he
called
up
prescott
on
the
telephone
and
begged
him
to
return
the
bonds
prescott
laughed
at
his
fears
and
assured
him
that
everything
was
all
right
cotton
was
sure
to
go
up
an
hour
later
the
broker
who
owned
the
bonds
came
in
and
took
up
his
loan
and
john
removed
two
american
navigation
from
another
bundle
and
handed
them
to
the
loan
clerk
of
course
the
numbers
on
the
bonds
were
not
the
same
but
few
persons
would
notice
a
little
thing
like
that
even
if
they
kept
a
record
of
it
they
had
the
bonds
that
was
the
main
thing
once
more
john
rushed
to
the
told
prescott
what
had
occurred
and
besought
him
for
the
bonds
it
too
late
now
growled
prescott
cotton
has
gone
down
i
could
only
get
one
back
at
the
most
we
had
better
stand
pat
and
get
out
on
the
next
bulge
john
was
by
this
time
almost
hysterical
the
perspiration
broke
out
on
his
forehead
every
now
and
then
and
he
shuddered
as
he
counted
his
securities
and
entered
up
his
figures
if
cotton
should
go
down
some
more
that
was
the
hideous
possibility
they
would
have
to
put
up
more
margin
and
then
down
in
the
vault
where
the
depositors
bonds
were
kept
were
two
piles
of
overland
one
contained
about
two
hundred
and
the
other
nearly
six
hundred
bonds
the
par
value
of
these
negotiable
securities
alone
was
nearly
eight
hundred
thousand
dollars
twice
a
year
john
cut
the
coupons
off
of
them
each
pile
was
marked
with
the
owner
name
they
were
never
called
for
and
it
appeared
that
these
customers
intended
to
keep
them
there
permanently
john
realizing
that
the
chances
of
detection
were
smaller
removed
two
bonds
from
the
pile
of
two
hundred
overlands
and
substituted
them
with
prescott
for
the
two
navigation
then
cotton
went
down
with
a
slump
prescott
did
not
wait
even
to
telephone
he
came
himself
to
the
trust
company
and
told
john
that
they
needed
two
more
bonds
for
additional
margin
to
protect
their
loan
but
he
said
it
was
merely
temporary
and
that
they
had
better
even
up
by
buying
some
more
cotton
john
went
down
into
the
vault
and
came
back
with
four
more
overland
bonds
under
his
coat
he
was
in
for
it
now
and
might
as
well
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
for
a
lamb
he
was
beginning
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
being
a
thief
he
was
to
be
sure
wretchedly
unhappy
but
he
was
experiencing
the
excitement
of
trying
to
dodge
fate
until
fortune
looked
his
way
cotton
still
went
down
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
prescott
perhaps
had
not
bought
all
the
cotton
now
that
he
is
in
prison
he
thinks
maybe
prescott
did
but
he
kept
going
down
into
the
vault
and
bringing
up
more
bonds
and
getting
reckless
bought
more
cotton
quantities
of
it
in
a
month
sixty
bonds
were
gone
from
the
pile
of
two
hundred
john
a
nervous
wreck
almost
laughed
grimly
at
the
joke
of
being
short
sixty
bonds
at
home
they
thought
he
was
getting
run
down
his
wife
he
was
so
kind
and
thoughtful
that
she
had
never
been
so
happy
it
made
her
fearful
that
he
had
some
fatal
disease
and
knew
he
was
going
to
die
up
at
the
bank
john
made
a
separate
bundle
of
sixty
bonds
out
of
the
pile
of
six
hundred
so
that
he
could
substitute
them
for
those
first
taken
if
the
owner
called
for
them
it
was
not
likely
that
both
owners
would
call
for
their
bonds
on
the
same
day
so
that
he
was
practically
safe
until
one
or
the
other
had
withdrawn
his
deposit
about
this
time
the
special
accountants
came
around
to
make
their
annual
investigation
it
was
apparently
done
in
the
regular
and
usual
way
one
examiner
stood
inside
the
vault
and
another
outside
surrounded
by
four
or
five
assistants
they
investigated
the
loans
john
brought
them
out
in
armfuls
and
the
accountants
checked
them
off
and
sent
them
back
when
john
brought
out
the
one
hundred
and
forty
bonds
left
in
the
bundle
of
two
hundred
overland
he
placed
on
top
of
them
the
pile
of
sixty
bonds
taken
from
the
other
bundle
of
six
hundred
then
he
took
them
back
shifted
over
the
sixty
and
brought
out
the
bundle
of
six
hundred
overland
made
up
in
part
of
the
same
bonds
it
was
the
easiest
thing
going
the
experts
simply
counted
the
sixty
bonds
twice
and
john
had
the
sixty
bonds
or
prescott
had
them
down
the
street
later
the
same
firm
of
experts
certified
to
the
presence
of
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
missing
bonds
counting
the
bundle
not
only
twice
but
five
and
six
times
you
see
prescott
john
had
grown
wise
in
his
generation
after
that
he
felt
reasonably
secure
it
did
seem
almost
unbelievable
that
such
a
situation
could
exist
but
it
was
nevertheless
a
fact
that
it
did
he
expected
momentarily
that
his
theft
would
be
detected
and
that
he
would
be
thrown
into
prison
and
the
fear
of
the
actual
arrest
the
moment
of
public
ignominy
the
shock
and
agony
of
his
wife
and
family
were
what
drove
him
sleepless
into
the
streets
and
every
evening
to
the
theatres
to
try
to
forget
what
must
inevitably
come
but
the
fact
that
he
had
gone
wrong
that
he
was
a
thief
that
he
had
betrayed
his
trust
had
lost
its
edge
he
now
thought
no
more
of
shoving
a
package
of
bonds
into
his
overcoat
pocket
than
he
did
of
taking
that
garment
down
from
its
peg
behind
the
door
he
knew
from
inquiry
that
men
who
stole
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
were
caught
usually
got
as
long
a
term
as
those
who
stole
thousands
if
he
stole
one
bond
he
was
just
as
likely
to
get
ten
years
in
state
prison
as
if
he
stole
fifty
so
he
stole
fifty
and
when
they
were
wiped
out
he
stole
fifty
more
and
well
if
the
reader
is
interested
he
will
learn
before
the
end
of
the
story
just
what
john
steal
somehow
prescott
speculations
never
succeeded
occasionally
they
would
make
a
good
turn
and
get
a
few
bonds
back
but
the
next
week
there
would
be
a
new
fiasco
and
john
would
have
to
visit
the
overland
again
that
performance
of
the
accountants
had
given
him
a
huge
contempt
for
bankers
and
banking
he
knew
that
if
he
wanted
to
he
could
grab
up
a
million
any
day
and
walk
off
with
it
but
he
did
want
to
all
he
desired
now
was
to
get
back
to
where
he
was
before
all
the
speculation
was
in
the
hands
of
prescott
and
prescott
never
seemed
worried
in
the
least
he
called
on
john
almost
daily
for
what
extra
bonds
were
needed
as
additional
collateral
and
john
took
his
word
absolutely
as
to
the
result
of
the
transactions
he
could
not
do
otherwise
for
one
word
from
prescott
would
have
ruined
him
before
long
the
pile
of
two
hundred
overland
was
gone
so
was
a
large
quantity
of
other
securities
for
john
and
prescott
had
dropped
cotton
and
gone
plunging
into
the
stock
market
here
however
they
had
no
better
success
than
before
of
course
a
difficulty
arose
when
the
interest
on
the
overland
came
due
the
coupons
had
to
be
cut
by
some
one
in
the
bank
and
although
john
usually
cut
them
he
did
not
always
do
so
sometimes
the
loan
clerk
himself
would
take
a
hand
and
call
for
a
particular
lot
of
bonds
john
however
was
now
fertile
in
devices
the
owner
of
the
larger
pile
of
six
hundred
bonds
usually
wrote
to
have
his
coupons
cut
about
the
of
april
john
would
make
up
a
collection
of
six
hundred
bonds
of
the
same
sort
carry
them
up
and
cut
the
coupons
in
the
loan
cage
the
other
man
generally
sent
in
a
draft
for
his
interest
on
the
second
or
third
of
may
but
now
the
bonds
were
away
scattered
all
over
the
street
so
john
started
a
new
operation
to
get
the
bonds
back
and
straighten
out
the
coupon
tangle
he
substituted
with
the
brokers
an
equal
number
of
bonds
of
other
companies
the
interest
upon
which
was
not
yet
due
there
was
a
large
block
of
electric
and
cumberland
which
served
his
purpose
admirably
and
thus
he
kept
up
with
the
game
when
the
coupons
became
due
on
the
latter
he
carried
back
the
first
it
kept
him
and
prescott
busy
most
of
the
time
juggling
securities
at
least
john
knew
was
kept
busy
and
prescott
claimed
to
be
equally
so
there
were
many
loans
of
brokers
and
others
all
secured
by
the
same
sort
of
collateral
most
of
these
john
appropriated
when
it
was
necessary
to
check
off
the
loans
john
having
retained
enough
of
the
same
kind
of
bonds
to
cover
the
largest
loan
would
bring
up
the
same
bundle
time
after
time
with
a
different
name
upon
it
if
one
of
the
customers
wanted
to
pay
off
a
loan
and
his
bonds
were
gone
he
would
be
given
some
one
else
collateral
apparently
the
only
thing
that
was
necessary
was
to
have
enough
of
each
kind
of
security
on
hand
to
cover
the
largest
loan
on
the
books
at
any
given
time
once
when
the
examiners
were
at
work
on
the
vault
john
had
to
make
up
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
overland
or
from
the
different
small
loans
in
the
loan
vault
and
put
them
in
a
package
in
the
deposit
vault
in
order
to
make
it
appear
that
certain
depositors
bonds
were
all
there
the
most
extraordinary
performance
of
all
was
when
upon
one
of
the
annual
examinations
john
covered
the
absence
of
over
fifty
bonds
in
the
collateral
covering
a
certain
loan
by
merely
shoving
the
balance
of
the
securities
into
the
back
of
the
vault
so
that
it
was
not
examined
at
all
he
had
taken
these
bonds
to
substitute
for
others
in
different
brokers
offices
and
it
so
happened
that
there
were
no
similar
securities
in
the
building
thus
the
deficiency
could
not
be
covered
up
even
by
john
expert
sleight
of
hand
of
course
if
there
had
been
other
bonds
of
the
same
kind
in
another
vault
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
to
substitute
them
but
there
were
not
so
john
pushed
the
remaining
one
hundred
and
fifty
bonds
into
a
dark
corner
of
the
vault
and
awaited
the
discovery
with
throbbing
pulses
yet
strange
to
relate
these
watchdogs
of
finance
did
not
see
the
bonds
which
john
had
hidden
and
did
not
discover
that
anything
was
wrong
since
for
purposes
of
its
own
the
bank
had
neglected
to
make
any
record
of
the
loan
in
question
it
would
really
have
been
safer
for
john
if
he
had
taken
the
whole
pile
but
then
he
did
not
know
that
the
accountants
were
going
to
do
their
business
in
any
such
crazy
fashion
the
whole
thing
came
to
seem
a
sort
of
joke
to
john
he
never
took
any
bonds
for
his
own
personal
use
he
gave
everything
to
prescott
and
he
rarely
if
ever
saw
prescott
except
to
hand
him
securities
one
day
prescott
walked
right
into
the
bank
itself
and
john
gave
him
one
hundred
and
bonds
which
he
stuffed
under
his
overcoat
and
carried
away
remember
that
this
is
a
the
thing
which
began
in
august
dragged
over
through
the
following
year
and
on
into
john
weathered
two
examinations
by
the
accountants
the
last
being
in
october
when
they
certified
that
the
company
was
absolutely
and
everything
intact
on
that
particular
day
john
had
over
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
overland
and
scattered
over
the
street
in
the
first
six
months
they
lost
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
cotton
then
they
played
both
sides
of
the
market
in
stocks
and
got
badly
bitten
as
bears
in
the
temporary
bull
market
in
the
autumn
of
selling
union
pacific
at
which
afterward
went
to
northern
pacific
at
which
went
to
etc
then
they
shifted
their
position
became
bulls
and
went
long
of
stock
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
slump
they
bought
reading
at
american
smelters
at
pennsylvania
at
union
at
and
northern
pacific
at
at
one
time
john
had
five
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
bonds
out
of
the
vaults
the
thing
might
have
been
going
on
still
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
anticipated
merger
between
john
company
and
another
was
put
through
and
a
new
vault
in
a
new
building
prepared
to
receive
the
securities
of
course
on
such
an
occasion
a
complete
examination
would
be
made
of
all
the
securities
and
there
would
be
practically
no
chance
to
deceive
the
accountants
moreover
a
part
of
the
securities
had
actually
been
moved
when
the
worst
slump
came
and
they
needed
more
it
was
obvious
that
the
jig
was
up
a
few
more
days
and
john
knew
that
the
gyves
would
be
upon
his
wrists
prescott
and
he
took
an
account
of
the
stock
they
had
lost
and
went
into
committee
on
ways
and
means
neither
had
any
desire
to
run
away
wall
street
was
the
breath
of
life
to
them
prescott
said
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
take
enough
more
to
stand
off
the
company
he
cited
a
case
in
boston
where
a
clerk
who
was
badly
in
was
advised
by
his
lawyer
to
take
a
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
more
then
the
lawyer
dickered
with
the
bank
and
brought
it
to
terms
the
lawyer
got
thousand
dollars
the
bank
got
the
rest
and
the
thief
was
let
go
prescott
said
they
ought
to
get
away
with
enough
more
to
make
the
bank
loss
a
million
he
thought
would
make
them
see
what
was
the
wise
thing
to
do
prescott
also
said
he
would
try
to
get
a
lawyer
who
could
bring
some
pressure
to
bear
on
the
officials
of
the
company
it
would
be
a
rather
unpleasant
situation
to
have
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
state
superintendent
of
banking
john
agreed
to
get
the
additional
securities
and
turn
them
over
to
prescott
unfortunately
almost
everything
had
by
this
time
been
moved
into
the
new
vault
and
all
john
could
get
was
a
stock
certificate
for
fifteen
hundred
railroad
shares
standing
in
his
own
name
and
thousand
dollars
in
notes
these
he
gave
to
prescott
thus
increasing
the
amount
stolen
from
the
bank
without
discovery
to
between
six
and
seven
hundred
thousand
dollars
this
was
on
the
day
before
the
actuaries
were
to
make
their
investigation
knowing
that
his
arrest
was
now
only
a
question
of
time
john
about
eleven
on
the
following
morning
left
the
trust
company
for
the
last
time
he
was
in
telephonic
communication
with
prescott
who
in
turn
was
in
touch
with
their
lawyer
unfortunately
the
president
of
the
company
had
gone
out
of
town
over
sunday
so
that
again
their
plans
went
awry
for
nearly
two
years
john
had
not
known
an
hour
devoid
of
haunting
fear
from
a
cheerful
and
contented
youth
he
had
become
despondent
taciturn
and
nervous
he
was
the
same
affectionate
husband
and
attentive
son
as
before
and
his
general
characteristics
remained
precisely
the
same
he
was
scrupulous
to
a
penny
in
every
other
department
of
his
life
and
undoubtedly
would
have
felt
the
same
pricks
of
conscience
had
he
been
guilty
of
any
other
act
of
dishonesty
the
affair
at
the
bank
was
a
thing
apart
the
embezzler
of
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
was
not
john
at
all
but
a
separate
personality
wearing
john
clothes
and
bearing
his
name
he
perceived
clearly
the
enormity
of
his
offense
but
because
he
was
the
same
john
in
every
other
respect
he
had
a
feeling
that
somehow
the
fact
that
had
done
the
thing
was
purely
fortuitous
in
other
words
that
the
bonds
had
to
be
taken
were
going
to
be
taken
anyway
and
that
fate
had
simply
elected
him
to
take
them
surely
he
had
not
wanted
the
bonds
had
had
no
intention
of
stealing
half
a
million
dollars
and
in
short
was
not
the
kind
of
a
man
who
would
steal
half
a
million
dollars
each
night
he
tossed
sleepless
till
the
light
stole
in
through
the
shutters
at
every
corner
on
his
way
uptown
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
behind
him
the
front
doorbell
never
rang
that
his
muscles
did
not
become
rigid
and
his
heart
almost
stop
beating
if
he
went
to
a
theatre
or
upon
an
excursion
he
passed
the
time
wondering
if
the
next
day
he
would
still
be
a
free
man
in
short
he
paid
in
full
in
physical
misery
and
mental
anxiety
and
wretchedness
for
the
real
moral
obliquity
of
his
crime
the
knowledge
of
this
maddened
him
for
what
was
coming
yet
he
realized
that
he
had
stolen
half
a
million
dollars
and
that
justice
demanded
that
he
should
be
punished
for
it
after
leaving
the
bank
john
called
up
prescott
and
learned
that
the
plan
to
adjust
matters
with
the
president
had
miscarried
by
reason
of
the
latter
absence
the
two
then
met
in
a
saloon
and
here
it
was
arranged
that
john
should
call
up
the
loan
clerk
and
tell
him
that
something
would
be
found
to
be
wrong
at
the
bank
but
that
nothing
had
better
be
said
about
it
until
the
following
monday
morning
when
the
president
would
return
the
loan
clerk
however
refused
to
talk
with
him
and
hung
up
the
receiver
john
had
nowhere
to
go
for
he
dared
not
return
home
and
spent
the
afternoon
until
six
riding
in
street
cars
and
sitting
in
saloons
at
that
hour
he
again
communicated
with
prescott
who
said
that
he
had
secured
rooms
for
him
and
his
wife
at
a
certain
hotel
where
they
might
stay
until
matters
could
be
fixed
up
john
arranged
to
meet
his
wife
at
street
with
prescott
and
conduct
her
to
the
hotel
as
fate
decreed
the
loan
clerk
came
out
of
the
subway
at
precisely
the
same
time
saw
them
together
and
followed
them
meantime
a
hurry
call
had
been
sent
for
the
president
who
had
returned
to
the
city
john
fully
aware
that
the
end
had
come
went
to
bed
at
the
hotel
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
day
he
had
taken
the
bonds
two
years
before
slept
soundly
at
three
the
next
morning
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
his
wife
awakened
him
and
john
opened
it
as
he
did
so
a
policeman
forced
his
way
in
and
the
loan
clerk
who
stood
in
the
corridor
just
behind
him
exclaimed
theatrically
officer
there
is
your
man
john
is
now
in
prison
serving
out
the
sentence
which
the
court
believed
it
necessary
to
inflict
upon
him
as
a
warning
to
others
prescott
is
also
serving
a
term
at
hard
labor
a
sentence
somewhat
longer
than
john
the
trust
company
took
up
their
accounts
paid
the
losses
of
the
luckless
pair
and
owing
to
a
rise
in
prices
which
came
too
late
to
benefit
the
latter
escaped
with
the
comparatively
trifling
loss
of
a
little
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
at
once
every
banking
house
and
trust
company
upon
the
street
looked
to
its
system
of
checks
upon
the
honesty
of
its
employees
and
took
precautions
which
should
have
been
taken
long
before
the
story
was
a
nine
days
wonder
then
union
pacific
dropped
twenty
points
more
the
tide
of
finance
closed
over
the
heads
of
john
and
prescott
and
they
were
forgotten
had
the
company
instead
of
putting
itself
at
the
mercy
of
a
clerk
placed
double
combinations
on
the
loan
and
deposit
vaults
and
employed
two
men
one
to
act
as
a
check
upon
the
other
to
handle
its
securities
or
had
it
merely
adopted
the
even
simpler
expedient
of
requiring
an
officer
of
the
company
to
be
present
when
any
securities
were
to
be
removed
from
the
vaults
john
would
probably
not
now
be
in
jail
it
would
seem
that
it
would
not
be
a
difficult
or
complicated
matter
to
employ
a
doorkeeper
who
did
not
have
access
himself
to
stand
at
the
door
of
the
vault
and
check
off
all
securities
removed
therefrom
or
returned
thereto
an
officer
of
the
bank
should
personally
see
that
the
loans
earned
up
to
the
cage
in
the
morning
were
properly
returned
to
the
vaults
at
night
and
secured
with
a
time
lock
such
a
precaution
would
not
cost
the
stockholders
a
tenth
of
one
per
cent
in
dividends
it
is
a
trite
saying
that
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
a
pound
of
cure
but
this
is
as
true
in
the
case
of
financial
institutions
at
least
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
employe
as
of
the
company
it
is
an
ingenious
expedient
to
insure
one
self
with
a
fidelity
corporation
against
the
possible
defalcations
of
one
servants
and
doubtless
certain
risks
can
only
be
covered
in
some
such
fashion
these
methods
are
eminently
proper
so
far
as
they
go
but
they
unfortunately
do
not
serve
the
public
purpose
of
protecting
the
weak
from
undue
and
unnecessary
temptation
banks
and
trust
companies
are
prone
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
most
peculations
are
easily
detected
and
severely
punished
but
the
public
interest
demands
that
all
business
state
municipal
and
private
should
be
so
conducted
that
dishonesty
may
not
only
be
punished
but
prevented
a
builder
who
took
a
chance
on
the
strength
of
a
girder
would
have
small
credit
in
his
profession
a
good
bridge
is
one
which
will
bear
the
strain
not
only
of
the
pedestrian
but
of
the
elephant
a
deluge
or
an
earthquake
may
occur
and
the
bridge
may
tumble
but
next
time
it
is
built
stronger
and
better
thus
science
progresses
and
the
public
interest
is
subserved
a
driver
who
overloads
his
beast
is
regarded
as
a
fool
or
a
brute
perhaps
such
names
are
too
harsh
for
those
who
overload
the
moral
backbone
of
an
inexperienced
subordinate
surely
the
fault
is
not
all
on
one
side
while
there
are
no
formulas
to
calculate
the
resiliency
of
human
character
we
may
demand
the
same
prudence
on
the
part
of
the
officers
of
financial
institutions
as
we
do
from
nursemaids
lumbermen
and
manufacturers
of
explosives
though
we
may
have
confidence
in
the
rectitude
of
our
fellows
we
have
no
right
to
ignore
the
limitations
and
weaknesses
of
mankind
it
would
not
outrage
the
principles
of
justice
if
one
who
placed
needless
and
disproportionate
strain
upon
the
morals
of
another
were
himself
regarded
as
an
accessory
to
the
crime
vii
the
duc
de
nevers
and
god
gives
to
every
man
the
virtue
temper
understanding
taste
that
lifts
him
into
life
and
lets
him
fall
just
in
the
niche
he
was
ordained
to
fill
the
task
cowper
one
morning
there
lay
on
my
desk
a
note
finely
written
in
pencil
and
dated
tombs
prison
monsieur
will
you
be
so
gracious
as
to
extend
to
the
undersigned
the
courtesy
of
a
private
interview
in
your
office
i
have
a
communication
of
the
highest
importance
to
make
to
you
respectfully
charles
julius
francis
de
nevers
across
the
street
in
the
courtyard
the
prisoners
were
taking
their
daily
exercise
two
by
two
they
marched
slowly
around
the
enclosure
in
the
centre
of
which
a
small
bed
of
geraniums
struggled
bravely
in
mortal
combat
with
the
dust
and
grime
of
centre
street
some
of
the
prisoners
walked
with
heads
erect
and
shoulders
thrown
back
others
slouched
along
with
their
arms
dangling
and
their
chins
resting
upon
their
chests
when
one
of
them
failed
to
keep
up
with
the
rest
a
keeper
who
stood
in
the
shade
by
a
bit
of
ivy
in
a
corner
of
the
wall
got
after
him
somehow
the
note
on
the
desk
did
not
seem
to
fit
any
one
of
the
gentry
whom
i
could
see
so
distinctly
from
my
window
the
name
too
did
not
have
the
customary
tombs
sound
de
nevers
i
repeated
it
slowly
to
myself
with
varying
accent
it
seemed
as
though
i
had
known
the
name
before
it
carried
with
it
a
suggestion
of
the
novels
of
stanley
weyman
of
books
on
old
towns
and
the
châteaux
and
cathedrals
of
france
i
wondered
who
the
devil
charles
julius
francis
de
nevers
could
be
of
course
if
one
answered
all
the
letters
one
gets
from
the
tombs
it
would
keep
a
secretary
busy
most
of
the
working
hours
of
the
day
and
if
one
acceded
to
all
the
various
requests
the
prisoners
make
to
interview
them
personally
or
to
see
their
fathers
mothers
sisters
brothers
sweethearts
and
wives
a
prosecutor
might
as
well
run
an
intelligence
office
and
be
done
with
it
but
as
i
the
note
i
began
to
have
a
sneaking
feeling
of
curiosity
to
see
what
charles
julius
francis
de
nevers
looked
like
so
i
departed
from
the
usual
rule
of
my
office
rang
for
a
messenger
and
directed
him
to
ascertain
the
full
name
of
the
prisoner
from
whom
the
note
had
come
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
and
the
date
of
his
incarceration
also
to
supply
me
at
once
with
copies
of
the
indictment
and
the
complaint
then
i
instructed
him
to
have
de
nevers
brought
over
as
soon
as
he
could
be
got
into
shape
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
i
was
expecting
a
visitor
when
a
couple
of
hours
later
an
undersized
entered
my
office
and
reported
that
he
had
a
prisoner
in
his
custody
for
whom
i
had
sent
to
the
tombs
glancing
up
from
my
desk
i
saw
standing
behind
his
keeper
a
tall
and
man
in
fashionably
cut
garments
whose
well
shaped
head
and
narrow
face
thin
aquiline
nose
and
carefully
trimmed
pointed
beard
seemed
to
bespeak
somewhat
different
antecedents
from
those
of
the
ordinary
occupant
of
a
cell
in
the
city
prison
i
should
have
instinctively
risen
from
my
chair
and
offered
my
aristocratic
looking
visitor
a
chair
had
not
the
keeper
unconsciously
brought
me
to
a
realization
of
my
true
position
by
remarking
say
counsellor
i
guess
while
you
talking
to
his
nibs
i
step
out
into
the
hall
and
take
a
smoke
certainly
said
i
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
i
will
be
responsible
for
the
er
prisoner
then
as
the
keeper
hesitated
in
putting
his
suggestion
into
execution
i
reached
into
the
upper
drawer
of
my
desk
produced
two
of
what
are
commonly
known
in
the
parlance
of
the
criminal
courts
building
as
cigars
and
handed
them
to
him
well
said
i
after
the
keeper
had
departed
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
leaving
the
visitor
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
office
i
have
sent
for
you
as
you
requested
and
shall
be
glad
to
hear
anything
you
have
to
say
of
course
any
communication
which
you
may
see
fit
to
make
to
me
is
voluntary
and
in
the
event
for
your
trial
for
er
any
crime
with
which
you
may
be
charged
may
be
used
against
you
i
had
a
certain
feeling
of
embarrassment
in
making
this
customary
declaration
since
the
whole
idea
of
this
person
being
a
criminal
was
so
incongruous
as
to
put
a
heavy
strain
on
one
credulity
however
i
recalled
that
a
certain
distinguished
englishman
of
letters
has
declared
that
there
is
no
essential
incongruity
between
crime
and
culture
he
acknowledged
my
remark
with
a
slight
smile
of
deprecation
and
with
a
courteous
bow
took
the
seat
to
which
i
motioned
him
i
wish
to
thank
you
he
said
in
excellent
english
marked
by
the
slightest
possible
suggestion
of
a
foreign
accent
for
your
exceeding
courtesy
in
responding
so
quickly
to
my
request
i
am
aware
he
added
that
it
is
unusual
for
prisoners
to
seek
interviews
with
the
what
shall
i
say
as
we
call
him
but
he
added
with
a
smile
i
think
you
will
find
that
mine
is
an
unusual
affair
i
had
already
begun
to
think
so
and
reaching
to
the
upper
drawer
on
the
side
of
my
desk
i
produced
from
the
box
reserved
for
judges
prominent
members
of
the
bar
borough
presidents
commissioners
of
departments
and
distinguished
foreigners
a
havana
of
the
variety
known
in
our
purlieus
as
a
cigar
and
tendered
the
same
to
him
ah
he
said
many
thanks
i
do
not
smoke
the
cigar
perhaps
has
a
cigarette
will
pardon
me
if
i
say
that
this
is
the
first
act
of
kindness
which
has
been
accorded
to
me
since
my
incarceration
three
weeks
ago
somewhere
i
found
a
box
of
cigarettes
one
of
which
he
removed
gracefully
holding
it
between
fingers
which
i
noticed
were
singularly
white
and
delicate
and
lighting
it
with
the
air
of
a
diplomat
at
an
international
conference
you
can
hardly
appreciate
he
ventured
the
humiliation
to
which
i
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
of
france
have
been
subjected
i
lighted
the
cigar
which
he
had
declined
and
with
mingled
feelings
of
embarrassment
distrust
and
curiosity
inquired
if
his
name
was
charles
julius
francis
de
nevers
i
wish
it
were
possible
to
describe
the
precise
look
which
flashed
across
his
face
as
he
answered
my
question
that
is
my
name
he
said
or
at
least
rather
i
am
charles
julius
francis
and
i
am
of
nevers
may
i
speak
confidentially
were
my
family
to
be
aware
of
my
present
situation
they
would
never
recover
from
the
humiliation
and
disgrace
connected
with
it
certainly
said
i
anything
which
you
may
tell
me
which
you
wish
to
be
kept
confidential
i
will
treat
as
such
provided
of
course
that
what
you
tell
me
is
the
truth
you
shall
hear
nothing
else
he
replied
then
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
said
simply
and
with
great
dignity
i
am
by
direct
inheritance
today
the
duc
de
nevers
my
father
the
last
duke
having
died
in
the
month
of
february
any
such
announcement
would
ordinarily
have
filled
me
with
amusement
but
that
the
gentleman
sitting
before
me
should
declare
himself
to
be
a
duke
or
even
a
prince
seemed
entirely
natural
indeed
said
i
unable
to
think
of
any
more
appropriate
remark
yes
said
de
nevers
and
is
naturally
surprised
that
one
of
my
distinguished
position
should
be
now
a
tenant
of
an
american
jail
but
if
will
do
me
the
honor
of
listening
for
a
few
moments
i
will
explain
my
present
extraordinary
predicament
i
am
charles
julius
françois
eldest
son
of
the
late

i
make
this
statement
by
way
of
introduction
in
order
that
you
may
understand
fully
my
situation
during
my
childhood
i
had
an
english
tutor
in
paris
and
when
i
reached
the
age
of
ten
years
i
was
sent
by
my
father
to
the
college
louis
le
grand
where
i
took
the
course
of
science
and
letters
and
graduated
from
the
lycée
with
the
degree
of
bachelor
on
the
of
august
having
passed
my
examination
for
the
polytechnic
i
remained
there
two
years
and
on
my
graduation
received
a
commission
as
of
engineers
and
immediately
entered
the
application
school
at
fontainebleau
where
i
was
graduated
in
as
lieutenant
of
engineers
and
assigned
to
the
first
regiment
of
engineers
at
versailles
de
nevers
paused
and
exhaled
the
cigarette
smoke
will
pardon
me
if
i
go
into
detail
for
only
in
that
way
will
he
be
convinced
of
the
accuracy
of
what
i
am
telling
him
pray
go
on
said
i
if
what
you
tell
me
is
true
your
case
is
extraordinary
indeed
my
first
act
of
service
continued
de
nevers
was
on
the
of
august
when
i
was
sent
to
tonkin
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
the
details
of
my
voyage
on
the
transport
to
china
but
will
simply
state
that
i
was
wounded
in
the
engagement
at
yung
chuang
on
the
of
november
of
the
same
year
and
had
the
distinction
of
receiving
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
therefor
i
was
immediately
furloughed
back
to
france
where
i
entered
the
superior
school
of
war
and
took
my
staff
major
brevet
at
the
same
time
i
seized
the
opportunity
to
follow
the
course
of
the
sorbonne
and
secured
the
additional
degree
of
doctor
of
science
i
had
received
an
excellent
education
in
my
youth
and
always
had
a
taste
for
study
which
i
have
taken
pains
to
pursue
in
whatever
part
of
the
world
i
happened
to
be
stationed
as
a
result
i
am
able
to
converse
with
considerable
fluency
in
english
as
perhaps
you
have
already
observed
as
well
as
in
spanish
italian
german
russian
arabic
and
to
a
considerable
extent
in
japanese
in
i
was
sent
to
berlin
as
military
attaché
but
was
subsequently
recalled
because
i
had
violated
the
rules
of
international
etiquette
by
fighting
three
duels
with
german
officers
the
ambassador
at
this
time
was
charles
de
courcel
you
will
understand
that
there
was
no
disgrace
connected
with
my
recall
but
the
necessity
of
defending
my
honor
was
incompatible
with
the
rules
of
the
service
and
after
fifteen
months
in
berlin
i
was
remanded
to
versailles
with
the
rank
of
first
lieutenant
under
colonel
quinivet
here
i
pursued
my
studies
and
was
then
ordered
to
the
soudan
whence
after
being
wounded
i
was
sent
to
senegal
here
i
acted
as
governor
of
the
city
of
louis
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
the
climate
of
senegal
is
exceedingly
unhealthy
i
fell
ill
with
a
fever
and
was
obliged
to
return
to
france
where
i
was
assigned
to
the
office
of
the
general
staff
major
in
paris
at
the
opening
of
the
war
with
dahomey
in
i
was
sent
in
command
of
the
engineers
of
the
corps
expeditional
and
on
the
of
november
of
that
year
was
severely
wounded
at
dakar
in
dahomey
having
received
a
spear
cut
through
the
lungs
on
this
occasion
i
had
the
distinction
of
being
promoted
as
major
of
engineers
and
was
created
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
on
the
battle
field
the
wound
in
my
lungs
was
of
such
a
serious
character
that
colonel
dodds
sent
me
back
once
more
to
france
on
furlough
and
president
carnot
was
kind
enough
to
give
me
his
personal
commendation
for
my
services
i
was
now
years
old
and
had
already
attained
high
rank
in
my
profession
i
had
had
opportunity
to
pursue
studies
in
chemistry
medicine
and
science
and
my
only
interest
was
in
the
service
of
my
country
and
in
qualifying
myself
for
my
future
duties
my
life
up
to
that
time
had
been
uniformly
happy
i
was
the
eldest
son
and
beloved
both
of
my
father
and
mother
my
social
position
gave
me
the
entrée
to
the
best
of
society
wherever
i
happened
to
be
as
yet
however
i
had
never
been
in
love
at
this
time
occurred
the
affair
which
in
a
measure
changed
my
career
the
wound
in
my
lungs
was
slow
in
healing
and
at
the
earnest
invitation
of
my
sister
lady
londonderry
i
went
to
london
at
that
time
she
was
living
in
belgravia
square
it
was
here
i
met
my
first
wife
de
nevers
paused
the
cigarette
had
gone
out
for
the
first
time
he
seemed
to
lose
perfect
control
of
himself
i
busied
myself
with
some
papers
until
he
should
have
regained
his
self
possession
you
will
understand
he
said
in
a
few
moments
these
things
are
not
governed
by
law
and
statute
the
woman
with
whom
i
fell
in
love
and
who
was
in
every
respect
the
equal
in
intellectual
attainments
beauty
and
charm
of
manner
of
my
own
people
was
the
nursery
governess
in
my
sister
household
she
returned
my
affection
and
agreed
to
marry
me
the
proposed
marriage
excited
the
utmost
antipathy
on
the
part
of
my
family
my
fiancée
was
dismissed
from
my
sister
household
and
i
returned
to
paris
with
the
intention
of
endeavoring
by
every
means
in
my
power
to
induce
my
father
to
permit
me
to
wed
the
woman
i
loved
it
is
doubtless
difficult
for
to
appreciate
the
position
of
a
french
officer
in
america
ah
america
is
free
one
can
marry
the
woman
one
loves
but
in
france
no
officer
can
marry
without
the
consent
of
the
minister
of
war
and
of
the
president
of
the
republic
and
more
than
that
he
can
not
marry
unless
his
intended
wife
possesses
a
dowry
of
at
least
fifty
thousand
francs
which
must
be
deposited
with
the
minister
of
war
for
investment
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
enjoyed
the
confidence
and
friendship
of
president
carnot
the
latter
at
my
father
request
refused
me
permission
to
marry
there
was
no
choice
left
for
me
but
to
resign
my
commission
and
this
i
did
i
returned
to
england
and
was
married
at
thomas
church
london
on
the
of
june
my
education
as
an
engineer
had
been
of
the
most
highly
technical
and
thorough
character
and
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
in
america
i
could
earn
a
comfortable
living
my
wife
and
i
therefore
sailed
for
america
immediately
after
our
marriage
i
first
secured
a
position
in
some
iron
works
in
south
boston
and
for
a
time
lived
happily
a
boy
oscar
named
after
my
father
was
born
to
us
while
we
were
living
in
the
town
of
winchester
near
boston
another
son
was
born
a
year
later
in
the
same
place
and
still
a
third
in
pittsburgh
where
i
had
gone
to
assume
the
position
of
general
foreman
of
the
homestead
steel
works
and
assistant
master
mechanic
of
the
carnegie
steel
company
i
rapidly
secured
the
confidence
of
my
employers
and
was
sent
upon
several
occasions
to
study
new
processes
in
different
parts
of
the
country
during
one
of
my
vacations
we
returned
to
england
and
visited
my
people
who
lived
in
manchester
here
she
died
on
the
of
june
de
nevers
paused
again
and
it
was
some
moments
before
he
continued
after
the
death
of
my
wife
my
father
expressed
himself
as
ready
for
a
reconciliation
but
although
this
took
place
i
had
not
the
heart
to
remain
in
france
i
liked
america
and
had
attained
distinction
in
my
profession
i
therefore
expressed
my
intention
of
returning
to
continue
my
career
as
an
engineer
but
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
my
father
left
my
three
children
with
my
parents
they
are
now
living
at
the
château
of
my
mother
at
nievre
i
was
sent
to
chicago
to
study
a
new
blast
furnace
and
two
years
later
when
schwab
organized
the
company
at
mariopool
south
siberia
he
offered
me
the
position
of
general
manager
which
i
accepted
here
i
remained
until
november
when
all
the
american
engineers
were
arrested
and
imprisoned
on
the
order
of
general
kozoubsky
of
the
russian
engineers
who
at
the
same
time
shot
and
murdered
my
assistant
thomas
mcdonald
for
refusing
to
allow
him
to
remove
pig
iron
from
the
storehouse
without
giving
a
receipt
for
it
ambassador
mccormick
secured
our
immediate
release
and
we
returned
to
the
states
has
no
idea
of
the
power
of
these
russian
officers
the
murder
of
my
assistant
was
of
the
most
brutal
character
kozoubsky
came
to
my
office
and
demanded
the
iron
but
having
secured
it
refused
to
sign
the
receipt
which
mcdonald
presented
to
him
mcdonald
said
shall
not
remove
the
iron
if
you
do
not
sign
the
receipt
as
he
spoke
the
words
the
general
drew
his
revolver
and
shot
him
down
like
a
dog
i
returned
to
america
in
january
and
have
since
then
been
doing
work
as
a
consulting
engineer
last
january
i
visited
my
parents
in
paris
at
their
home
at
champs
elysée
you
have
doubtless
seen
the
mansion
with
its
two
gates
and
black
railing
of
decorative
iron
i
had
no
sooner
returned
to
america
than
i
received
a
cable
announcing
the
death
of
my
father

from
his

february
a
the
announcement
was
carefully
engraved
and
was
of
an
expensive
character
and
i
read
it
with
considerable
interest
does
care
to
see
the
photographs
of
my
family
here
producing
a
photograph
of
a
gentleman
and
lady

a

lady
londonderry
and
the
earl
and
countess
of
dudley
my
interest
in
my
visitor
story
had
for
the
moment
completely
driven
from
my
mind
the
real
object
of
the
interview
which
ostensibly
was
to
explain
the
reason
for
his
incarceration
his
straightforward
narrative
carried
absolute
conviction
with
it
that
he
was
the
legitimate
duc
de
nevers
i
accepted
without
hesitation
that
he
was
a
man
of
education
culture
and
many
accomplishments
was
self
evident
you
have
had
an
extraordinary
career
i
ventured
yes
he
replied
it
has
been
a
life
of
action
and
i
may
say
of
suffering
permit
me
to

trustworthy

knowing
him
for
the
last
years
geo
andré
of
seal
the
document
seemed
in
substance
merely
a
repetition
of
what
de
nevers
had
already
told
me
and
i
handed
it
back
to
him
satisfied
of
its
correctness
but
public
business
is
public
business
and
if
the
duc
de
nevers
had
anything
to
communicate
to
me
in
my
official
character
it
was
time
for
him
to
do
so
well
duke
said
i
not
knowing
very
well
how
otherwise
to
address
him
do
you
desire
to
communicate
anything
to
me
in
connection
with
your
present
detention
in
the
tombs
ah
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
deprecation
i
can
hardly
understand
that
myself
perhaps
has
the
papers
ah
yes
i
see
they
are
on
his
desk
will
observe
that
i
am
accused
of
the
crime
of
what
is
it
called
in
english
ah
yes
perjury
but
i
assure
that
it
is
entirely
a
mistake
i
picked
up
the
indictment
and
found
that
the
grand
jury
of
the
county
of
new
york
accused
one
charles
de
nevers
of
the
crime
of
perjury
committed
as
follows
that
one
william
douglas
having
been
arrested
by
william
crawford
a
member
of
the
police
force
of
the
city
of
new
york
upon
the
charge
of
having
violated
the
motor
vehicle
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
ordinance
against
speeding
he
the
said
charles
de
nevers
had
then
and
there
offered
himself
to
go
bail
for
the
said
douglas
and
did
sign
a
certain
written
undertaking
called
a
bond
for
the
appearance
of
the
said
douglas
before
the
magistrate
wherein
he
swore
that
he
owned
a
certain
house
and
lot
situate
at
west
street
in
the
county
of
new
york
which
was
free
and
clear
of
all
incumbrances
and
of
the
value
of
not
less
than
twenty
thousand
dollars
whereas
in
truth
and
in
fact
he
the
said
charles
de
nevers
did
not
own
the
said
house
and
lot
which
did
not
then
and
there
stand
in
the
name
of
him
the
said
charles
de
nevers
but
was
the
property
of
one
helen
bent
and
so
recorded
in
the
registry
of
deeds
which
said
the
grand
jury
charles
de
nevers
then
and
there
well
knew
and
so
they
accused
him
of
feloniously
knowingly
wilfully
corruptly
and
falsely
committing
the
crime
of
perjury
against
the
form
of
the
statute
in
such
cases
made
and
provided
and
against
the
peace
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
their
dignity
and
this
they
did
over
the
signature
of
william
travers
jerome
district
attorney
how
did
this
happen
i
inquired
hardly
believing
my
senses
was
it
a
fact
that
you
made
this
false
statement
to
the
police
for
the
purpose
of
securing
bail
for
mr
douglas
de
nevers
leaned
forward
and
was
about
to
answer
when
a
messenger
entered
the
room
and
stated
that
i
was
wanted
in
the
court
another
time
if
will
permit
me
said
he
i
have
much
to
thank
you
for
if
will
give
me
another
hearing
it
shall
be
my
pleasure
to
explain
fully
i
rose
and
summoned
the
keeper
de
nevers
bowed
and
offered
his
hand
which
i
took
i
have
much
to
thank
you
for
he
repeated
as
i
hurried
out
of
the
room
i
encountered
the
keeper
outside
the
door
say
counsellor
what
sort
of
a
was
he
throwin
into
you
he
inquired
with
a
wink
de
nevers
was
well
inside
my
office
looking
drearily
out
of
my
window
towards
the
courtyard
in
the
tombs
where
his
fellows
were
still
pursuing
their
weary
march
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
why
who
did
his
nibs
tell
you
he
was
the
duc
de
nevers
i
replied
say
said
you
do
mean
you
swallowed
that
do
you
do
you
know
what
the
feller
did
why
one
afternoon
when
a
swell
guy
and
his
girl
were
out
in
their
gas
wagon
a
mounted
cop
in
the
park
pulls
them
in
and
takes
them
over
to
the
street
court
well
just
as
me
friend
is
taking
them
into
the
house
along
walks
this
charley
nevers
wid
his
tall
silk
hat
and
pearl
handle
cane
wid
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
and
his
black
coat
tails
dangling
around
his
heels
just
like
boni
de
castellane
and
says
he
says
he
i
inquire
what
for
you
apprehending
this
gentleman
and
lady
says
he
with
that
me
friend
hands
him
out
some
strong
language
for
buttin
in
and
charley
is
so
much
shocked
at
the
insult
to
himself
and
the
lady
that
he
steps
in
before
the
sergeant
and
offers
to
go
bond
for
douglas
just
to
go
the
cop
one
better
givin
the
sergeant
the
same
line
of
drip
that
he
has
been
handin
out
to
us
in
the
tombs
about
his
bein
the
son
of
oscar
the
duc
de
nevers
and
related
to
all
the
crowned
heads
in
europe
then
he
ups
and
signs
the
bail
bond
for
a
house
and
lot
that
he
has
never
seen
in
his
life
and
here
he
is
up
agin
it
an
it
a
good
stiff
one
his
honor
will
be
handin
out
to
him
to
my
way
of
thinkin
for
these
high
fallutin
foreigners
has
got
to
be
put
a
stop
to
and
charley
nevers
is
a
good
one
to
begin
on
i
think
you
wrong
said
i
but
we
can
tell
better
later
on
all
that
day
my
thoughts
kept
reverting
to
the
duc
de
nevers
one
thing
was
more
than
certain
and
that
was
that
of
all
the
various
personages
whom
i
had
met
during
my
journey
through
the
world
none
was
more
fitted
to
be
a
duke
than
he
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
during
my
interview
i
had
felt
myself
to
be
in
the
company
of
a
superior
being
one
of
different
clay
from
that
of
which
i
was
composed
a
man
of
better
brain
and
better
education
vastly
more
rounded
and
experienced
a
cultivated
citizen
of
the
world
who
would
be
at
home
in
any
company
no
matter
how
distinguished
and
who
would
rise
to
any
emergency
as
i
ate
my
dinner
at
the
club
the
name
de
nevers
played
mistily
in
the
recesses
of
my
memory
surely
there
was
something
historic
about
it
some
flavor
of
the
days
of
kings
and
courtiers
smoking
my
cigar
in
the
library
i
fell
into
a
reverie
in
which
the
tombs
with
its
towers
and
grated
windows
figured
as
a
gray
château
of
old
tourraine
and
charles
julius
francis
in
hunting
costume
as
a
mediaeval
monseigneur
with
a
hooded
falcon
on
his
wrist
i
awoke
to
find
directly
in
my
line
of
vision
upon
the
shelf
of
the
alcove
in
front
of
me
the
solid
phalanx
of
the
ten
volumes
of
larousse
grand
dictionaire
universe
du
xix
siècle
and
i
reached
forward
and
pulled
down
the
letter
nevers
there
it
was
capitol
of
the
department
of
nievre
ducal
palace
built
in
charles
iii
de
gonzagne
de
charles
ii
had
sold
the
duchy
of
nevers
and
his
other
domains
in
france
to
cardinal
mazarin
par
acte
du
jul
so
far
so
good
the
cardinal
had
left
the
duchy
by
will
to
philippe
jules
françois
mancini
his
nephew
who
had
died
may
ah
it
was
like
meeting
an
old
friend
philippe
jules
françois
mancini
mazarin
had
obtained
letters
confirming
him
in
the
possession
of
the
duchy
of
nivernais
and
donzois
in
then
he
had
died
in
leaving
the
duchy
to
louis
jules
barbon
this
son
who
was
the
last
duc
of
nivernais
had
died
in
he
was
the
last
of
the
name
said
larousse
i
rubbed
my
eyes
it
was
there
fast
enough
last
of
the
name
something
was
wrong
without
getting
up
i
rang
for
a
copy
of
burke
peerage
londonderry
marquess
of
married
lady
theresa
susey
helen
lady
of
grace
of
john
of
jerusalem
eldest
daughter
of
the
earl
of
shrewsbury
dear
me
dudley
earl
of
married
september
rachael
lady
of
grace
of
the
order
of
john
of
jerusalem
youngest
daughter
of
charles
henry
gurney
i
closed
the
book
and
began
to
think
and
the
more
i
thought
the
more
i
wondered
there
really
did
seem
particular
need
of
going
further
if
the
fellow
was
a
fraud
he
was
a
fraud
that
was
all
but
how
in
heaven
name
could
a
man
make
up
a
story
like
that
that
night
i
dreamed
once
more
of
the
ducal
palace
of
nivernais
only
its
courtyard
resembled
that
of
the
tombs
and
many
couples
walked
in
a
straggling
line
beneath
its
walls
a
day
or
two
passed
and
i
had
heard
no
more
of
the
duc
charles
julius
when
one
afternoon
a
lady
called
at
my
office
and
sent
in
her
name
as
de
nevers
she
proved
to
be
an
attractive
young
woman
a
little
over
twenty
dressed
in
black
whose
face
showed
that
she
had
suffered
more
than
a
little
she
explained
that
her
husband
was
confined
in
the
tombs
on
a
charge
of
perjury
but
that
was
not
all
he
was
worse
than
a
perjurer
he
was
an
impostor
he
had
another
wife
living
somewhere
in
england
in
manchester
she
thought
oh
it
was
too
terrible
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
the
count
charles
de
nevers
eldest
son
of
the
duc
de
nevers
in
france
you
know
and
she
had
believed
him
he
had
had
letters
to
everybody
in
montreal
her
home
and
plenty
of
money
and
beautiful
clothes
he
had
dazzled
her
completely
the
wedding
had
been
quite
an
affair
and
presents
had
come
from
the
duke
and
duchess
of
nevers
from
the
marchioness
of
londonderry
and
from
the
countess
of
dudley
there
were
also
letters
from
the
prince
and
princess
of
aremberg
in
belgium
and
the
counts
andré
and
fernand
of
nevers
it
had
all
been
so
wonderful
and
romantic
then
they
had
gone
on
their
wedding
journey
and
had
been
ecstatically
happy
in
chicago
they
had
been
received
with
open
arms
that
was
before
the
death
of
the
duke
yes
her
mourning
was
for
the
duke
she
smiled
sadly
i
think
she
still
more
than
half
believed
that
she
was
a
duchess
and
she
deserved
to
be
if
ever
any
girl
did
then
all
of
a
sudden
their
money
had
given
out
and
the
duke
had
been
arrested
for
not
paying
their
hotel
bill
perhaps
i
would
like
to
see
a
newspaper
clipping
it
was
dreadful
she
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
anywhere
after
that
she
had
even
been
obliged
to
pawn
his
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
leopold
cross
of
belgium
and
another
beautiful
decoration
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
wear
when
they
went
out
to
dinner
this
was
the
clipping
chicago
society
the
dupe
of
bogus
count
hotel
and
several
whilom
friends
filled
with
regret
the
count
arrested
chicago
jan
count
charles
julius
françois
de
nevers
was
in
the
police
court
for
defrauding
the
auditorium
annex
of
a
board
bill
the
count
came
to
the
french
consul
henri
meron
amply
supplied
with
credentials
he
posed
as
consulting
engineer
of
the
united
states
steel
corporation
he
was
introduced
into
all
the
clubs
including
the
alliance
française
where
he
was
entertained
and
spoke
on
literature
he
was
accompanied
by
a
charming
young
countess
and
the
honors
showered
upon
them
and
the
adulation
paid
by
society
was
something
they
will
never
forget
they
returned
the
entertainments
the
count
borrowed
several
thousand
dollars
president
furber
of
the
olympic
games
said
of
the
count
this
man
confided
to
me
that
he
had
invented
a
machine
for
perpetual
motion
the
chief
difficulty
of
which
was
that
it
accumulated
energy
so
fast
that
it
could
not
be
controlled
he
asked
me
to
invest
in
some
of
his
schemes
which
i
refused
to
do
the
fate
of
the
count
is
still
pending
and
he
was
led
back
to
a
cell
he
has
been
a
week
behind
the
bars
the
countess
is
in
tears
the
countess
is
me
she
explained
was
he
sent
to
prison
i
asked
oh
no
she
answered
you
see
they
really
could
tell
whether
he
was
a
count
or
not
so
they
had
to
let
him
go
he
ought
to
be
hung
i
cried
i
really
think
he
ought
she
answered
you
see
it
is
quite
embarrassing
because
legally
i
have
never
been
married
at
all
have
i
i
do
know
i
answered
lying
like
a
gentleman
time
enough
to
look
that
up
later
i
found
out
afterwards
she
said
apparently
somewhat
encouraged
that
his
first
wife
was
a
nurse
maid
in
london
yes
said
i
he
told
me
so
himself
just
then
there
came
a
knock
at
my
door
and
appeared
how

said
with
a

how
did
he
come
to
do
such
a

thing
as
to
offer
to
go

a

what

it
do

he
was

to

i

he
was
always
doing
things
like
that
he
wanted
to
seem
fine
and
grand
i
guess
we
always
travelled
in
style
why
the
afternoon
he
signed
the
bond
he
came
home
and
told
me
how
the
police
had
been
troubling
a
gentleman
who
had
a
lady
with
him
in
an
automobile
and
how
he
was
able
to
settle
the
whole
affair
without
the
slightest
difficulty
and
send
them
on
their
way
he
was
quite
pleased
about
it
but
why
do
you
suppose
be
did
it
he
just
thought
he
do
a
favor
suggested
and
in
that
way
get
in

an
take
their
money
later
mebbe
who
is
he
do
you

asked
the

charles

at

bar
of
justice
convicted
of

his
degradation
had
wrought
no
change
in
the
dignity
of
his
bearing
or
the
impassiveness
of
his
general
appearance
and
he
received
the
sentence
of
the
court
without
a
tremor
and
with
shoulders
thrown
back
and
head
erect
as
befitted
a
scion
of
a
noble
house
there
just
one
thing
for
me
to
do
with
you
charles

said
the
judge
rudely
and
that
is
to
send
you
to

for
a
term
of

francis
made
no
sign
there
is
one
other
thing
i
should
like
to
know
however

that
is

a
finder
of
missing
heirs
the
professional
prosecutor
is
continually
surprised
at
the
insignificant
amount
of
crime
existing
in
comparison
with
the
extraordinary
scope
of
criminal
opportunity
to
be
sure
the
number
of
crimes
actually
detected
is
infinitesimal
as
contrasted
with
those
committed
but
even
so
the
conviction
constantly
grows
that
the
world
is
astonishingly
honest
when
one
considers
the
unlikelihood
that
any
specific
prospective
offence
will
be
discovered
how
few
dishonest
servants
there
are
for
example
out
of
the
million
or
so
composing
that
class
of
persons
who
have
an
unlimited
opportunity
to
snap
up
not
only
unconsidered
trifles
but
personal
property
of
great
value
the
actual
honesty
of
the
servants
is
probably
greater
than
that
of
the
masters
in
the
final
analysis
men
are
not
only
presumed
to
be
innocent
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
but
are
found
to
be
so
as
a
matter
of
daily
experience
so
far
as
honesty
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
is
concerned
and
the
fact
that
we
rely
so
implicitly
upon
the
truthfulness
and
integrity
of
our
fellows
is
the
principal
reason
why
violations
of
this
imperative
social
law
should
be
severely
dealt
with
if
it
were
possible
adequately
to
determine
or
deal
with
any
such
issue
mere
lying
should
be
made
a
crime
it
is
matter
of
constant
wonder
that
shrewd
business
men
will
put
through
all
sorts
of
deals
when
thousands
of
dollars
are
at
stake
relying
entirely
upon
the
word
of
some
single
person
whom
they
do
not
in
fact
know
john
smith
is
looking
for
a
house
he
finds
one
he
likes
with
an
old
lady
who
says
her
name
is
sarah
jones
living
in
it
and
offers
her
forty
thousand
dollars
for
her
real
estate
she
accepts
his
lawyer
searches
the
title
and
finds
that
sarah
jones
is
the
owner
of
record
the
old
lady
is
invited
to
the
lawyer
office
executes
a
warranty
deed
and
goes
off
with
the
forty
thousand
dollars
now
in
a
great
number
of
instances
no
one
really
knows
whether
the
aged
dame
is
sarah
jones
or
not
and
she
perhaps
may
be
and
sometimes
is
only
the
caretaker
second
cousin
who
is
looking
after
the
house
in
the
latter
absence
there
are
thousands
of
acres
of
land
and
hundreds
of
millions
of
money
waiting
at
compound
interest
to
be
claimed
by
unknown
heirs
or
next
of
kin
even
if
the
real
ones
can
not
be
found
one
would
think
that
this
defect
could
be
easily
supplied
by
some
properly
ingenious
person
my
uncle
bill
went
to
sea
in
and
was
never
heard
from
again
will
you
find
out
if
he
left
any
money
wrote
a
client
to
the
author
careful
search
failed
to
reveal
any
money
but
if
the
money
had
been
found
how
easy
it
would
have
been
to
turn
up
a
nephew
yet
the
industry
of
producing
properly
authenticated
nephews
heirs
legatees
next
of
kin
and
claimants
of
all
sorts
has
never
been
adequately
developed
there
are
plenty
of
agents
who
for
a
moderate
fee
will
inform
you
whether
or
not
there
is
a
fortune
waiting
for
you
but
there
is
no
agency
within
the
writer
knowledge
which
will
supply
an
heir
for
every
fortune
from
a
business
point
of
view
the
idea
seems
to
have
possibilities
some
few
years
after
the
civil
war
a
swede
named
ebbe
petersen
emigrated
to
this
country
to
better
his
condition
fortune
smiled
upon
him
and
he
amassed
a
modest
bank
account
which
with
considerable
foresight
he
invested
in
a
large
tract
of
unimproved
land
in
the
region
known
as
the
bronx
new
york
city
in
the
summer
of
petersen
determined
to
take
a
vacation
and
revisit
sweden
and
accordingly
deeded
all
his
real
estate
to
his
wife
just
before
starting
he
decided
to
take
his
wife
and
only
child
a
little
girl
of
ten
or
twelve
with
him
accordingly
they
set
sail
from
hoboken
saturday
august
upon
the
steamer
of
the
thingvalla
line
bound
for
copenhagen
at
four
tuesday
morning
at
a
point
thirty
miles
south
of
sable
island
and
two
hundred
miles
out
of
halifax
the
in
the
midst
of
a
thick
fog
crashed
suddenly
into
a
sister
ship
the
of
the
same
line
and
sank
the
was
herself
badly
crippled
but
after
picking
up
survivors
managed
to
limp
into
halifax
from
which
port
the
rescued
were
brought
to
new
york
only
fourteen
of
the
passengers
had
been
saved
and
the
petersens
were
not
among
them
they
were
never
heard
of
again
and
no
relatives
came
forward
to
claim
their
property
which
happening
to
be
in
the
direct
line
of
the
city
development
was
in
course
of
time
mapped
out
into
streets
and
house
lots
and
became
exceedingly
valuable
gradually
houses
were
built
upon
it
various
people
bought
it
for
investment
and
it
took
on
the
look
of
other
suburban
property
in
the
month
of
december
over
seventeen
years
after
the
sinking
of
the
a
lawyer
named
huffman
browne
offered
to
sell
at
a
bargain
to
a
young
architect
named
benjamin
levitan
two
house
lots
adjacent
to
the
southwest
corner
of
one
hundred
and
street
and
monroe
avenue
new
york
city
it
so
happened
that
browne
had
not
long
before
induced
levitan
to
go
into
another
deal
in
which
the
architect
suspicions
had
been
aroused
by
finding
that
the
property
alleged
by
the
lawyer
to
be
improved
was
in
fact
unbuilt
upon
he
had
lost
no
money
in
the
original
transaction
but
he
determined
that
no
such
mistake
should
occur
a
second
time
and
he
accordingly
visited
the
property
and
also
had
a
search
made
of
the
title
which
revealed
the
fact
that
browne
was
not
the
record
owner
as
he
had
stated
but
that
on
the
contrary
the
land
stood
in
the
name
of
william
r
hubert
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
both
the
parties
to
this
proposed
transaction
were
men
well
known
in
their
own
professions
browne
particularly
was
a
lawyer
of
some
distinction
and
an
editor
of
what
were
known
as
the
old
new
york
civil
procedure
reports
he
was
a
man
careful
in
his
dress
particular
in
his
speech
modest
and
quiet
in
his
demeanor
by
reputation
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
and
had
practised
at
the
new
york
bar
some
years
but
levitan
who
had
seen
many
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
and
had
something
of
the
sherlock
holmes
in
his
composition
determined
to
seek
the
advice
of
the
district
attorney
and
having
done
so
received
instructions
to
go
ahead
and
consummate
the
purchase
of
the
property
he
therefore
informed
browne
that
he
had
learned
that
the
latter
was
not
the
owner
of
record
to
which
browne
replied
that
that
was
true
but
that
the
property
really
did
belong
to
him
in
fact
being
recorded
in
hubert
name
merely
as
a
matter
of
convenience
because
hubert
was
unmarried
and
that
moreover
he
browne
had
an
unrecorded
deed
from
hubert
to
himself
which
he
would
produce
or
would
introduce
hubert
to
levitan
and
let
him
execute
a
deed
direct
levitan
assented
to
the
latter
proposition
and
the
fourteenth
of
december
was
fixed
as
the
date
for
the
delivery
of
the
deeds
and
the
payment
for
the
property
at
two
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
browne
appeared
at
office
where
a
detective
was
already
in
attendance
and
stated
that
he
had
been
unable
to
procure
hubert
personal
presence
but
had
received
from
him
deeds
duly
executed
to
the
property
these
he
offered
to
levitan
at
this
moment
the
detective
stepped
forward
took
possession
of
the
papers
and
invited
the
lawyer
to
accompany
him
to
the
district
attorney
office
to
this
browne
offered
no
opposition
and
the
party
adjourned
to
the
criminal
courts
building
where
john
hart
an
assistant
district
attorney
accused
him
of
having
obtained
money
from
levitan
by
means
of
false
pretences
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
property
and
requested
from
him
an
explanation
browne
replied
without
hesitation
that
he
could
not
understand
why
this
charge
should
be
made
against
him
that
he
had
in
fact
received
the
deeds
from
hubert
only
a
short
time
before
he
had
delivered
them
to
levitan
that
hubert
was
in
new
york
that
he
was
the
owner
of
the
property
and
that
no
fraud
of
any
sort
had
been
attempted
or
intended
hart
now
examined
the
supposed
deeds
and
found
that
the
signatures
to
them
as
well
as
the
signatures
to
a
certain
affidavit
of
title
which
set
forth
that
william
hubert
was
a
person
of
substance
had
all
been
executed
before
a
notary
ella
braman
on
that
very
day
he
therefore
sent
at
once
for
braman
who
upon
her
arrival
immediately
and
without
hesitation
positively
identified
the
defendant
huffman
browne
as
the
person
who
had
executed
the
papers
before
her
an
hour
or
so
before
the
case
on
its
face
seemed
clear
enough
browne
had
apparently
deliberately
forged
william
hubert
name
and
it
did
not
even
seem
necessary
that
hubert
should
be
summoned
as
a
witness
since
the
property
was
recorded
in
his
name
and
browne
himself
had
stated
that
hubert
was
then
actually
in
new
york
but
browne
indignantly
protested
his
innocence
it
was
clear
he
insisted
that
braman
was
mistaken
for
why
in
the
name
of
should
he
a
lawyer
of
standing
desire
to
forge
name
particularly
when
he
himself
held
an
unrecorded
deed
of
the
same
property
and
could
have
executed
a
good
conveyance
to
levitan
had
the
latter
so
desired
such
a
performance
would
have
been
utterly
without
an
object
but
the
lawyer
was
nervous
and
his
description
of
hubert
as
a
wealthy
mine
owner
from
the
west
who
owned
a
great
deal
of
property
in
new
york
and
had
an
office
in
the
flatiron
building
did
not
ring
convincingly
in
hart
ears
the
assistant
district
attorney
called
up
the
janitor
of
the
building
in
question
on
the
telephone
but
no
such
person
had
an
office
there
browne
much
flustered
said
the
janitor
was
either
a
fool
or
a
liar
he
had
been
at
hubert
office
that
very
morning
he
offered
to
go
and
find
him
in
twenty
minutes
but
hart
thought
that
the
lawyer
had
better
make
his
explanation
before
a
magistrate
and
caused
his
arrest
and
commitment
on
a
charge
of
forgery
little
did
he
suspect
what
an
ingenious
fraud
was
about
to
be
unearthed
the
days
went
by
and
browne
stayed
in
the
tombs
unable
to
raise
the
heavy
bail
demanded
but
no
hubert
appeared
meantime
the
writer
to
whom
the
case
had
been
sent
for
trial
ordered
a
complete
search
of
the
title
to
the
property
and
in
a
week
or
so
became
possessed
to
his
amazement
of
a
most
extraordinary
and
complicated
collection
of
facts
he
discovered
that
the
lot
of
land
offered
by
browne
to
levitan
and
standing
in
hubert
name
was
originally
part
of
the
property
owned
by
ebbe
petersen
the
unfortunate
swede
who
with
his
family
had
perished
in
the
off
cape
sable
in
the
title
search
showed
that
practically
all
of
the
petersen
property
had
been
conveyed
by
mary
petersen
to
a
person
named
ignatius
by
a
deed
which
purported
to
have
been
executed
on
june
about
two
weeks
before
the
petersens
sailed
for
copenhagen
and
which
was
signed
with
petersen
mark
but
that
this
deed
had
not
been
recorded
until
july
after
the
loss
of
the
the
writer
busied
himself
with
finding
some
one
who
had
known
petersen
and
by
an
odd
coincidence
discovered
a
woman
living
in
the
bronx
who
had
been
an
intimate
friend
and
playmate
of
the
little
petersen
girl
this
witness
who
was
but
a
child
when
the
incident
had
occurred
clearly
recalled
the
fact
that
ebbe
petersen
had
not
decided
to
take
his
wife
and
daughter
with
him
on
the
voyage
until
a
few
days
before
they
sailed
they
had
then
invited
her
the
witness
now
a
cantwell
to
go
with
them
but
her
mother
had
declined
to
allow
her
to
do
so
petersen
moreover
according
to
cantwell
was
a
woman
of
education
who
wrote
a
particularly
fine
hand
other
papers
were
discovered
executed
at
about
the
same
time
signed
by
petersen
with
her
full
name
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
she
should
have
signed
any
deed
much
less
one
of
so
much
importance
with
her
and
moreover
that
she
should
have
executed
any
such
deed
at
all
when
her
husband
was
on
the
spot
to
convey
his
own
property
but
the
strangest
fact
of
all
was
that
the
attesting
witness
to
this
extraordinary
instrument
was
huffman
browne
it
also
appeared
to
have
been
recorded
his
eleven
years
after
its
execution
in
the
meantime
however
that
is
to
say
between
the
sinking
of
the
in
and
the
recording
of
mary
petersen
supposed
deed
in
another
deed
to
the
same
property
had
been
filed
this
document

had
apparently

both
these
deeds

through
two

browne
was
the
witness
to
both
these
parallel
transactions
of
course
it
was
simple
enough
to
see
what
had
occurred
in
a
mysterious
man
named
clark
without
vestige
of
right
or
title
so
far
as
the
records
showed
had
conveyed
ebbe
petersen
property
to
a
man
named
keilly
equally
unsubstantial
who
had
passed
it
over
to
one
then
browne
had
suddenly
recorded
petersen
deed
giving
the
very
same
property
thus
this
whoever
he
may
have
been
held
all
the
petersen
property
by
two
chains
of
title
one
through
clark
and
keilly
and
the
other
through
petersen
then
he
had
gone
ahead
and
deeded
it
all
away
to
various
persons
through
one
of
whom
william
hubert
had
secured
his
title
but
every
deed
on
record
which
purported
to
pass
any
fraction
of
the
petersen
property
was
witnessed
by
huffman
browne
and
browne
was
the
attesting
witness
to
the
deed
under
which
hubert
purported
to
hold
thus
the
chain
of
title
at
the
end
of
which
levitan
found
himself
ran

the

rubbed
his

and
wondered
who
in
thunder
all
these
people
were
who
for
example
to
begin
at
the
beginning
was
charles
clark
and
why
should
he
be
deeding
away
ebbe
petersen
property
and
who
were
keilly
and
and
all
the
rest
colliton
garretson
bolte
and
freeman
and
who
for
that
matter
was
hubert
a
score
of
detectives
were
sent
out
to
hunt
up
these
elusive
persons
but
although
the
directories
of
twenty
years
were
searched
no
charles
clark
john
keilly
or
could
be
discovered
nor
could
any
one
named
colliton
freeman
or
hubert
be
found
the
only
persons
who
did
appear
to
exist
were
garretson
and
bolte
quite
by
chance
the
assistant
district
attorney
located
the
former
of
these
who
proved
to
be
one
of
browne
clients
and
who
stated
that
he
had
taken
title
to
the
property
at
the
lawyer
request
and
as
a
favor
to
him
did
not
remember
from
whom
he
had
received
it
had
paid
nothing
for
it
received
nothing
for
it
and
had
finally
deeded
it
to
herman
bolte
at
the
direction
of
browne
herman
bolte
an
of
the
municipal
court
who
had
been
removed
for
misconduct
in
office
admitted
grumblingly
that
while
at
one
time
he
had
considered
purchasing
the
property
in
question
he
had
never
actually
done
so
that
the
deed
from
garretson
to
himself
had
been
recorded
without
his
knowledge
or
his
authority
that
he
had
paid
nothing
for
the
property
and
had
received
nothing
for
it
and
had
at
the
instruction
of
browne
conveyed
it
to
benjamin
freeman
garretson
apparently
had
never
seen
bolte
and
bolte
had
never
seen
freeman
while
william
hubert
the
person
to
whom
the
record
showed
freeman
had
transferred
the
property
remained
an
invisible
figure
impossible
to
reduce
to
tangibility
just
what
browne
had
attempted
to
do
had
done
was
obvious
in
some
way
being
a
lawyer
he
had
stumbled
upon
the
fact
that
this
valuable
tract
of
land
lay
unclaimed
accordingly
he
had
set
about
the
easiest
way
to
reduce
it
to
possession
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
he
had
forged
two
chains
of
title
one
through
an
assumed
heir
and
the
other
through
the
owner
herself
then
he
had
juggled
the
title
through
a
dozen
or
so
grantees
and
stood
ready
to
dispose
of
the
property
to
the
highest
bidder
there
he
stayed
in
the
tombs
demanding
a
trial
and
protesting
his
innocence
and
asserting
that
if
the
district
attorney
would
only
look
long
enough
he
would
find
william
hubert
but
an
interesting
question
of
law
had
cropped
up
to
delay
matters
of
course
if
there
was
anybody
by
the
name
of
hubert
who
actually
owned
the
property
and
browne
had
signed
his
name
conveying
the
same
to
a
deed
to
levitan
browne
was
guilty
of
forgery
in
the
first
degree
but
the
evidence
in
the
case
pointed
toward
the
conclusion
that
browne
himself
hubert
if
this
was
so
how
could
browne
be
said
to
have
forged
the
name
of
hubert
when
he
had
a
perfect
legal
right
to
take
the
property
under
any
name
he
chose
to
assume
this
was
incontestable
if
your
name
be
richard
roe
you
may
purchase
land
and
receive
title
thereto
under
the
name
of
john
doe
and
convey
it
under
that
name
without
violating
the
law
this
as
a
general
proposition
is
true
so
long
as
the
taking
of
a
fictitious
name
is
for
an
honest
purpose
and
not
tainted
with
fraud
the
assistant
district
attorney
felt
that
the
very
strength
of
his
case
created
as
it
were
a
sort
of
legal
weakness
for
the
more
evidence
he
should
put
in
against
browne
the
clearer
it
would
become
that
hubert
was
merely
browne
himself
and
this
would
necessitate
additional
proof
that
browne
had
taken
the
property
in
the
name
of
hubert
for
purposes
of
fraud
which
could
only
be
established
by
going
into
the
whole
history
of
the
property
of
course
if
browne
were
so
foolish
as
to
put
in
the
defence
that
hubert
really
existed
the
case
would
be
plain
sailing
if
however
browne
was
as
astute
as
the
district
attorney
believed
him
to
be
he
might
boldly
admit
that
there
was
no
hubert
except
himself
and
that
in
taking
title
to
the
property
and
disposing
thereof
under
that
name
he
was
committing
no
violation
of
law
for
which
he
could
be
prosecuted
the
case
was
moved
for
trial
on
the
twelfth
of
march
before
judge
warren
foster
in
part
three
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
in
new
york
the
defendant
was
arraigned
at
the
bar
without
counsel
owing
to
the
absence
of
his
lawyer
through
sickness
and
lewis
stuyvesant
chanler
the
later
of
the
state
was
assigned
to
defend
him
at
this
juncture
browne
arose
and
addressed
the
court
in
the
most
deferential
and
conciliatory
manner
he
urged
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
adjournment
until
such
time
as
he
could
produce
william
hubert
as
a
witness
stating
that
although
the
latter
had
been
in
town
on
december
and
had
personally
given
him
the
deeds
in
question
which
he
had
handed
to
levitan
hubert
interests
in
the
west
had
immediately
called
him
from
the
city
and
that
he
was
then
in
goldfields
nevada
that
since
he
had
been
in
the
tombs
he
browne
had
been
in
correspondence
with
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
alfred
skeels
of
the
teller
house
central
city
colorado
from
whom
he
had
received
a
letter
within
the
week
to
the
effect
that
hubert
had
arranged
to
start
immediately
for
new
york
for
the
purpose
of
testifying
as
a
witness
for
the
defence
the
prosecutor
thereupon
demanded
the
production
of
this
letter
from
the
alleged
skeels
and
browne
was
compelled
to
state
that
he
had
immediately
destroyed
it
on
its
receipt
the
prosecutor
then
argued
that
under
those
circumstances
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
people
evidence
showed
conclusively
that
no
such
person
as
hubert
existed
there
was
no
reason
why
the
trial
should
not
proceed
then
and
there
the
court
thereupon
ruled
that
the
case
should
go
on
a
jury
was
procured
after
some
difficulty
and
the
evidence
of
levitan
received
showing
that
browne
had
represented
hubert
to
be
a
man
of
substance
and
had
produced
an
affidavit
purported
to
be
sworn
to
by
hubert
to
the
same
effect
with
deeds
alleged
to
have
been
signed
by
him
braman
then
swore
that
upon
the
same
day
browne
had
himself
acknowledged
these
very
deeds
and
had
sworn
to
the
affidavit
before
her
as
a
notary
under
the
name
of
william
hubert
taken
with
the
fact
that
browne
had
in
open
court
stated
that
hubert
was
a
living
man
this
made
out
a
case
but
of
course
the
district
attorney
was
unable
to
determine
whether
or
not
browne
would
take
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf
or
what
his
defence
would
be
and
in
order
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
offered
in
evidence
all
the
deeds
to
the
property
in
question
thereby
establishing
the
fact
that
it
was
originally
part
of
the
petersen
estate
and
disclosing
the
means
whereby
it
had
eventually
been
recorded
in
the
name
of
hubert
the
prosecution
then
rested
its
case
and
the
burden
shifted
to
the
defence
to
explain
how
all
these
deeds
attested
by
browne
came
to
be
executed
and
recorded
it
was
indeed
a
difficult
if
not
impossible
task
which
the
accused
lawyer
undertook
when
he
went
upon
the
stand
he
again
positively
and
vehemently
denied
that
he
had
signed
the
name
of
hubert
to
the
deed
which
he
had
offered
to
levitan
and
persisted
in
the
contention
that
hubert
was
a
real
man
who
sooner
or
later
would
turn
up
he
admitted
knowing
the
petersen
family
in
a
casual
way
and
said
he
had
done
some
business
for
them
but
stated
that
he
had
not
heard
of
their
tragic
death
until
some
years
after
the
sinking
of
the
he
had
then
ascertained
that
no
one
had
appeared
to
lay
claim
to
petersen
estate
and
he
had
accordingly
taken
it
upon
himself
to
adveritse
for
heirs
in
due
course
charles
clark
had
appeared
and
had
deeded
the
property
to
keilly
who
in
turn
had
conveyed
it
to
just
who
this
mysterious
was
he
could
not
explain
nor
could
he
account
in
any
satisfactory
manner
for
the
recording
in
of
the
deed
signed
with
mary
petersen
mark
he
said
that
it
had
turned
up
in
hands
after
had
become
possessed
of
the
property
through
the
action
of
the
heirs
and
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
ever
having
seen
it
before
or
having
witnessed
it
in
the
latter
transactions
by
which
the
property
had
been
split
up
he
claimed
to
have
acted
only
as
attorney
for
the
different
grantors
he
was
unable
to
give
the
address
or
business
of
clark
keilly
or
freeman
and
admitted
that
he
had
never
seen
any
of
them
save
at
his
own
office
he
was
equally
vague
as
to
hubert
whose
new
york
residence
he
gave
as
fifth
avenue
no
such
person
however
had
ever
been
known
at
that
address
illustration
with
the
exception
of
the
upper
left
hand
signature
and
the
four
immediately
below
it
of
huffman
browne
these
are
all
the
signatures
of
imaginary
persons
invented
by
browne
to
further
his
schemes
the
upper
slip
shows
the
signatures
to
the
wilson
bond
among
which
appears
that
of
hubert
browne
gave
his
testimony
in
the
same
dry
polite
and
careful
manner
in
which
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
discuss
his
cases
and
deliver
his
arguments
it
seemed
wholly
impossible
to
believe
that
this
person
could
be
a
dangerous
character
yet
the
nature
of
his
offence
and
the
consequences
of
it
were
apparent
when
the
state
called
to
the
stand
an
old
who
had
bought
from
browne
one
of
the
lots
belonging
to
the
petersen
estate
holding
up
three
stumps
where
fingers
should
have
been
he
cried
out
choking
with
tears
my
vriends
for
vifteen
years
i
vorked
at
making
brooms
me
und
my
vife
from

in

until

at

und
i

trying
to
save
enough
money
to
puy
a

that
we
could
call

when
we
saved
eight
hundred
dollars
this
man
come
to
us
und
sold

a

we
were
very
happy
yesterday
anoder
man
served
me
mit
a
paper
that
we
must
leave
our
house
because
we
did
not
own
the
land
we
must
go

where
we
haf
no

is
being
taken
from
us
und
that
man
pointing
his
stumps
at
browne
that
man
has
stolen
it
from
us
he
stopped
unable
to
speak
the
defendant
lawyer
properly
objected
but
with
this
piece
of
testimony
ringing
in
their
ears
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
the
jury
took
but
five
minutes
to
convict
browne
of
forgery
in
the
first
degree
a
few
days
later
the
judge
sentenced
him
to
twenty
years
in
prison
then
other
people
began
to
wake
up
the
guessed
that
the
petersen
property
had
all
escheated
to
the
state
the
swedish
government
sent
a
deputy
to
make
inquiries
the
norwegian
government
was
sure
that
he
was
a
norwegian
and
the
danish
that
he
was
a
dane
no
one
knows
yet
who
is
the
real
owner
and
there
are
half
a
dozen
heirs
squatting
on
every
corner
of
it
things
are
much
worse
than
before
browne
tried
to
sell
the
lot
to
levitan
but
a
great
many
people
who
were
careless
before
are
careful
now
it
soon
developed
however
that
lawyer
browne
industry
and
ingenuity
had
not
been
confined
to
the
exploitation
of
the
estate
of
ebbe
petersen
before
the
trial
was
well
under
way
the
city
chamberlain
of
new
york
notified
the
district
attorney
that
a
peculiar
incident
had
occurred
at
his
office
in
which
not
only
the
defendant
figured
but
william
hubert
his
familiar
as
well
in
the
year
a
judgment
had
been
entered
in
the
supreme
court
which
adjudged
that
a
certain
george
wilson
was
entitled
to
a
interest
in
the
estate
of
jane
elizabeth
barker
recently
deceased
george
wilson
had
last
been
heard
of
twenty
years
before
as
a
farmhand
in
illinois
and
his
whereabouts
were
at
this
time
unknown
suddenly
however
he
had
appeared
that
is
to
say
huffman
browne
had
appeared
as
his
attorney
and
demanded
his
share
of
the
property
which
had
been
deposited
to
his
credit
with
the
city
chamberlain
and
amounted
to
hundred
dollars
the
lawyer
had
presented
a
petition
signed
apparently
by
wilson
and
a
bond
also
subscribed
by
him
to
which
had
been
appended
the
names
of
certain
sureties
one
of
these
was
a
william
hubert
the
same
william
hubert
who
had
mysteriously
disappeared
when
his
presence
was
so
vital
to
the
happiness
and
liberty
of
his
creator
but
the
city
chamberlain
had
not
been
on
his
guard
and
had
paid
over
the
hundred
dollars
to
browne
without
ever
having
seen
the
claimant
or
suspecting
for
an
instant
that
all
was
not
right
it
was
further
discovered
at
the
same
time
that
browne
had
made
several
other
attempts
to
secure
legacies
remaining
uncalled
for
in
the
treasury
in
how
many
cases
he
had
been
successful
will
probably
never
be
known
but
it
is
unlikely
that
his
criminal
career
dated
only
from
the
filing
of
the
forged
petersen
deed
in
browne
made
an
heroic
and
picturesque
fight
to
secure
a
reversal
of
his
conviction
through
all
the
state
courts
and
his
briefs
and
arguments
are
monuments
to
his
ingenuity
and
knowledge
of
the
law
he
alleged
that
his
conviction
was
entirely
due
to
a
misguided
enthusiasm
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
the
present
writer
whom
he
characterized
as
a
novelist
and
dreamer
the
whole
case
he
alleged
was
constructed
out
of
the
latter
fanciful
imagination
a
cobweb
of
suspicion
accusation
and
falsehood
some
day
his
friend
hubert
would
come
out
of
the
west
into
which
he
had
so
unfortunately
disappeared
and
release
an
innocent
man
sentenced
practically
to
death
because
the
case
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
one
whose
sense
of
the
dramatic
was
greater
than
his
logic
perchance
he
will
mayhap
when
huffman
browne
is
the
oldest
inmate
of
sing
sing
or
even
sooner
some
figure
will
appear
at
the
state
capitol
and
knock
tremblingly
at
the
door
of
the
executive
asking
for
a
pardon
or
a
rehearing
of
the
case
and
claiming
to
be
the
only
original
genuine
william
hubert
such
a
dénouement
would
not
be
beyond
the
realms
of
possibility
but
more
likely
the
request
will
come
in
the
form
of
a
petition
duly
attested
and
authenticated
before
some
notary
in
the
west
protesting
against
browne
conviction
and
incarceration
and
bearing
the
flowing
signature
of
william
hubert
the
same
signature
that
appears
on
browne
deeds
to
levitan
the
same
that
is
affixed
to
the

of

ix
a
murder
conspiracy
william
rice
years
of
age
died
at
the
berkshire
apartments
at
madison
avenue
new
york
city
at
about
half
after
seven
on
the
evening
of
sunday
september
he
had
been
ill
for
some
time
but
it
was
expected
that
he
would
recover
on
or
about
the
moment
of
his
death
two
elderly
ladies
friends
of
the
old
gentleman
had
called
at
the
house
with
cakes
and
wine
to
see
him
the
elevator
man
rang
the
bell
of
rice
apartment
again
and
again
but
could
elicit
no
response
and
the
ladies
much
disappointed
went
away
while
the
bell
was
ringing
charles
jones
the
confidential
valet
of
the
aged
man
was
waiting
he
says
in
an
adjoining
room
until
a
cone
saturated
with
chloroform
which
he
had
placed
over
the
face
of
his
sleeping
master
should
effect
his
death
jones
murder
rice
if
so
was
it
as
he
claims
at
the
instigation
of
albert
patrick
these
two
questions
now
settled
in
the
affirmative
forever
so
far
as
criminal
and
civil
litigation
are
concerned
have
been
the
subject
of
private
study
and
public
argument
for
more
than
seven
years
rice
was
a
childless
widower
living
the
life
of
a
recluse
attended
only
by
jones
who
was
at
once
his
secretary
valet
and
general
servant
no
other
person
lived
in
the
apartment
and
few
visitors
ever
called
there
patrick
was
a
new
york
lawyer
with
little
practice
who
had
never
met
rice
was
employed
as
counsel
in
litigation
hostile
to
him
yet
in
whose
favor
a
will
purporting
to
be
signed
by
rice
june
turned
up
after
the
latter
death
by
the
terms
of
which
patrick
came
into
the
property
amounting
to
over
seven
million
dollars
in
place
of
a
charitable
institution
named
in
an
earlier
will
of
it
is
now
universally
admitted
that
the
alleged
will
of
was
a
forgery
as
well
as
four
checks
drawn
to
patrick
order
two
for
each
one
for
and
one
for
which
represented
practically
all
of
rice
bank
accounts
an
order
giving
him
control
of
the
contents
of
rice
safe
deposit
vaults
in
which
were
more
than
in
securities
and
also
a
general
assignment
by
which
he
became
the
owner
of
rice
entire
estate
thus
upon
rice
death
patrick
had
every
possible
variety
of
document
necessary
to
possess
himself
of
the
property
jones
took
nothing
under
any
of
these
fraudulent
instruments
hence
patrick
motive
in
desiring
the
death
of
rice
is
the
foundation
stone
of
the
case
against
him
but
that
patrick
desired
and
would
profit
by
rice
death
in
no
way
tends
to
establish
that
rice
did
not
die
a
natural
death
patrick
would
profit
equally
whether
rice
died
by
foul
means
or
natural
and
the
question
as
to
whether
murder
was
done
must
be
determined
from
other
evidence
this
is
only
to
be
found
in
the
confession
of
the
valet
jones
and
in
the
testimony
of
the
medical
experts
who
performed
the
autopsy
jones
a
murderer
swears
that
upon
the
advice
and
under
the
direction
of
patrick
though
in
the
latter
absence
he
killed
his
master
by
administering
chloroform
there
is
no
direct
corroborative
evidence
save
that
of
the
experts
upon
jones
testimony
depended
the
question
of
conviction
or
acquittal
and
of
itself
this
was
not
sufficient
for
being
that
of
an
accomplice
it
must
under
the
new
york
law
be
corroborated
in
the
confession
of
jones
the
state
had
sufficient
evidence
of
the
crime
and
of
patrick
connection
with
it
providing
there
was
evidence
tending
to
connect
patrick
with
its
this
corroborative
evidence
is
largely
supplied
by
the
facts
which
show
that
for
a
long
time
patrick
conspired
with
jones
to
steal
the
bulk
of
rice
estate
at
his
death
this
evidence
not
only
shows
possible
motive
for
planning
rice
but
also
tends
to
corroborate
jones
whole
story
of
the
conspiracy
rice
did
not
know
patrick
even
by
sight
he
had
heard
of
him
only
as
a
person
retained
by
another
lawyer
holt
to
do
the
dirty
work
in
an
action
brought
by
rice
against
holt
as
executor
to
set
aside
rice
will
in
which
she
assumed
under
the
community
law
of
texas
where
rice
had
formerly
resided
to
dispose
of
some
of
property
if
rice
was
a
of
she
had
the
legal
right
to
do
this
otherwise
not
holt
employed
patrick
to
get
evidence
that
rice
still
was
such
a
resident
rice
knew
of
this
and
hated
patrick
patrick
connection
with
the
rice
litigation
had
begun
four
years
before
the
murder
which
was
not
planned
until
august
his
first
visit
to
rice
apartment
was
made
under
the
assumed
name
of
smith
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
whether
the
valet
could
be
corrupted
into
furnishing
fictitious
proof
of
rice
intent
to
reside
in
texas
he
flattered
jones
told
him
he
was
underpaid
and
not
appreciated
and
after
a
second
visit
at
which
he
disclosed
his
right
name
persuaded
him
to
typewrite
a
letter
on
rice
stationery
addressed
to
baker
botts
baker
lovett
rice
attorneys
in
which
he
should
be
made
to
say
that
he
had
lost
hope
of
winning
the
suit
against
holt
was
really
a
citizen
of
texas
and
wanted
to
settle
the
litigation
patrick
said
that
he
could
arrange
for
the
signing
of
such
a
letter
and
was
willing
to
pay
jones
for
his
help
jones
agreed
patrick
now
learned
that
rice
was
living
with
no
companion
except
jones
that
he
held
little
communication
with
the
outside
world
that
the
valet
was
in
his
confidence
and
thoroughly
familiar
with
his
papers
and
that
the
will
made
in
disinherited
natural
heirs
in
favor
of
an
educational
institution
which
he
had
founded
in
texas
he
also
learned
that
while
rice
was
years
of
age
he
was
in
possession
of
all
his
faculties
conducted
his
own
business
and
might
live
for
years
possessed
of
these
facts
patrick
evil
mind
soon
developed
a
conspiracy
with
jones
to
secure
the
whole
estate
rice
pet
charity
was
the
william
rice
institute
for
the
advance
of
science
art
and
literature
of
texas
which
he
had
founded
in
he
had
donated
to
it
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
by
the
will
of
only
small
legacies
were
bequeathed
to
relatives
while
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
was
left
to
the
institute
about
a
month
after
patrick
first
visit
to
the
berkshire
apartments
that
is
in
december
while
he
and
jones
were
examining
private
papers
they
stumbled
upon
the
will
patrick
saw
his
opportunity
by
the
forgery
of
a
new
will
which
would
increase
the
legacies
of
those
mentioned
in
the
will
of
and
leave
legacies
to
every
person
who
might
have
any
claim
upon
the
estate
it
would
be
for
the
interest
of
those
persons
to
sustain
and
carry
into
effect
the
forgery
the
whole
scheme
was
based
upon
the
belief
that
every
man
has
his
price
he
told
jones
that
he
thought
the
will
unjust
that
he
did
not
think
it
right
to
leave
so
little
to
relatives
and
later
he
brought
to
jones
a
rough
draft
of
a
will
which
could
be
substituted
for
the
genuine
one
patrick
was
to
get
half
the
estate
the
relatives
were
to
receive
double
or
three
times
the
amount
provided
in
the
will
and
what
was
left
was
to
be
given
to
the
rice
institute
he
proposed
that
jones
should
typewrite
this
will
and
guaranteed
to
arrange
for
the
witnessing
and
signing
of
it
and
promised
that
jones
should
get
whatever
he
wanted
jones
at
first
objected
but
was
finally
won
over
rewritten
many
times
to
include
new
ideas
of
the
conspirators
the
document
finally
reached
the
form
of
the
will
of
june
in
which
patrick
substituted
himself
for
the
rice
institute
and
made
himself
one
of
the
executors
an
ingenious
part
of
the
conspiracy
was
the
decision
to
leave
the
will
in
existence
if
patrick
had
destroyed
it
and
the
relatives
had
succeeded
in
overthrowing
the
will
of
the
estate
would
have
been
left
without
testamentary
disposition
and
the
relatives
would
have
got
more
than
was
provided
by
either
will
with
the
will
of
in
existence
however
the
relatives
would
get
less
if
they
overthrew
the
forgery
by
retaining
it
therefore
patrick
figured
that
the
relatives
would
have
selfish
reasons
for
accepting
the
forgery
as
genuine
the
preparation
of
this
bogus
will
occupied
about
a
month
and
the
next
question
was
the
procurement
of
witnesses
it
was
desirable
to
get
the
same
persons
who
witnessed
the
former
will
these
were
walter
wetherbee
and
harmon
clerks
for
many
years
at
swenson
banking
house
on
the
assumption
that
wetherbee
had
been
injured
by
rice
and
was
therefore
hostile
to
him
jones
practically
unfolded
the
scheme
he
told
wetherbee
that
one
of
rice
bonds
had
disappeared
and
that
rice
had
accused
wetherbee
of
stealing
it
he
wound
up
with
the
suggestion
i
will
get
one
witness
and
you
can
get
another
and
the
thing
is
done
but
wetherbee
indignantly
declined
to
join
in
the
conspiracy
morris
meyers
who
had
been
employed
in
patrick
office
and
david
short
a
friend
of
both
were
the
false
witnesses
finally
selected
they
were
clothed
with
the
appearance
of
honesty
and
were
brought
into
contact
with
rice
by
jones
at
various
times
meyers
as
a
notary
public
and
short
as
commissioner
of
deeds
for
the
state
of
texas
an
appointment
procured
for
him
by
patrick
probably
for
this
specific
purpose
the
date
of
the
forged
will
june
was
selected
to
correspond
with
the
date
of
three
genuine
papers
which
rice
acknowledged
before
short
on
that
date
illustration
last
page
of
the
forged
will
of
showing
the
forgery
of
rice
signature
and
the
false
attestation
of
short
and
meyers
the
next
step
was
to
obviate
the
absurdity
of
patrick
being
selected
as
the
residuary
legatee
at
a
time
when
he
was
engaged
in
bitter
litigation
against
rice
the
best
way
out
was
for
patrick
to
pose
as
a
lawyer
who
had
brought
about
a
settlement
of
this
expensive
litigation
and
thus
won
rice
regard
patrick
first
tried
to
accomplish
this
by
getting
friends
to
visit
rice
and
urge
a
settlement
but
rice
rebuffed
them
all
accordingly
patrick
again
resorted
to
forgery
and
in
august
manufactured
an
instrument
of
settlement
dated
march
but
such
an
agreement
would
not
explain
the
paradox
of
a
man
whom
rice
hated
and
despised
and
did
not
know
by
sight
turning
up
as
the
principal
beneficiary
under
his
will
it
was
necessary
to
manufacture
evidence
to
be
used
after
rice
death
in
support
of
his
claim
of
close
relations
the
idea
of
a
personal
meeting
with
rice
had
been
abandoned
on
advice
and
patrick
therefore
caused
the
valet
to
prepare
or
thirty
forged
letters
addressed
to
him
and
purporting
to
come
from
rice
these
referred
to
current
business
matters
and
conveyed
the
impression
that
it
was
rice
custom
to
seek
the
lawyer
advice
one
instructed
patrick
as
to
the
terms
of
the
will
of
carbon
copies
were
made
for
filing
in
rice
letter
book
after
his
death
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
and
to
secure
immediate
possession
of
rice
securities
a
general
assignment
to
patrick
of
all
rice
estate
was
forged
and
an
order
giving
him
access
to
and
possession
of
the
securities
on
deposit
in
rice
safety
vault
but
patrick
did
not
stop
here
he
procured
from
jones
three
checks
signed
by
rice
in
the
regular
course
of
business
one
payable
to
jones
for
his
july
salary
and
the
other
two
for
the
july
and
august
salary
of
an
employee
of
rice
in
texas
named
cohn
these
three
checks
patrick
kept
as
models
forwarding
to
cohn
two
forged
checks
filled
out
by
jones
upon
which
rice
signature
had
been
traced
and
returning
to
jones
a
substitute
check
with
rice
signature
traced
upon
it
all
three
checks
passed
through
the
banks
unsuspected
traced
signatures
were
also
substituted
for
genuine
ones
upon
letters
dictated
by
rice
to
his
texas
correspondents
thus
patrick
secured
the
circulation
of
five
copies
of
rice
signature
which
if
occasion
demanded
he
could
produce
as
standards
of
comparison
to
correspond
with
his
other
forgeries
the
principal
preparations
were
complete
but
title
under
the
will
might
long
be
delayed
and
perhaps
even
eventually
fail
patrick
was
poor
and
in
no
condition
to
conduct
adequately
a
serious
litigation
the
moment
rice
died
a
large
amount
of
cash
would
be
necessary
for
the
procurement
of
this
patrick
and
jones
looked
to
the
current
balance
of
rice
bank
account
which
amounted
to
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
on
deposit
at
swenson
private
bank
and
at
the
fifth
avenue
trust
company
with
this
they
felt
reasonably
secure
of
success
for
even
if
the
will
should
be
set
aside
as
fraudulent
they
had
a
second
line
of
defense
in
the
general
assignment
of
the
estate
and
the
orders
to
rice
two
million
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
securities
while
the
evidence
affords
a
motive
for
patrick
to
desire
the
death
of
rice
it
does
not
of
itself
up
to
this
point
indicate
the
slightest
intention
on
the
part
of
patrick
to
do
away
with
the
old
gentleman
it
was
therefore
conceded
by
the
prosecution
that
upon
jones
own
testimony
the
conspiracy
to
murder
was
not
formed
until
about
seven
weeks
before
the
event
the
first
evidence
which
points
to
an
intent
to
murder
is
the
famous
cremation
letter
dated
august
the
cremation
letter
from
rice
authorizing
patrick
to
cremate
his
body
shows
that
patrick
intended
to
do
away
with
rice
in
such
a
way
that
an
autopsy
must
if
possible
be
prevented
and
the
evidence
of
murder
destroyed
that
patrick
forged
such
a
letter
was
evidence
that
his
connection
with
the
murder
was
premeditated
and
deliberate
to
cremate
the
body
before
an
autopsy
it
was
necessary
to
procure
a
physician
certificate
that
rice
had
died
from
natural
causes
he
therefore
made
preparation
to
secure
such
a
certificate
and
then
upon
the
strength
of
the
cremation
letter
to
give
directions
for
the
immediate
destruction
of
the
body
patrick
with
the
view
of
having
at
hand
a
physician
who
would
be
unsuspicious
and
who
would
issue
a
certificate
of
death
from
natural
causes
induced
jones
to
send
for
curry
his
own
friend
and
physician
on
an
occasion
when
the
valet
was
ill
this
was
in
march
curry
came
and
jones
acting
under
patrick
advice
cautioned
him
not
to
mention
the
lawyer
name
to
rice
in
course
of
time
he
saw
rice
gained
his
good
opinion
and
became
his
attending
physician
but
rice
did
not
die
and
curiously
enough
it
was
he
himself
who
suggested
to
jones
the
instrumentality
of
death
which
was
finally
employed
for
he
read
an
article
dealing
with
the
dangers
of
chloroform
as
an
anaesthetic
and
discussed
it
with
the
valet
this
suggestion
was
conveyed
to
patrick
who
asked
curry
whether
chloroform
left
any
traces
discoverable
upon
an
autopsy
curry
rather
carelessly
replied
that
it
left
but
slight
traces
if
administered
only
in
the
quantities
which
would
be
fatal
to
a
man
with
a
weak
heart
patrick
told
jones
so
jones
alleges
to
procure
some
chloroform
and
this
he
did
sending
to
texas
for
two
bottles
of
two
ounces
each
from
curry
remarks
it
was
manifest
that
a
weakened
condition
of
the
patient
was
an
important
element
and
as
jones
was
taking
some
mercury
pills
prescribed
for
him
by
curry
the
valet
induced
his
master
to
take
some
of
them
the
old
gentleman
was
benefited
however
rather
than
weakened
this
was
the
forgery
of
the
cremation
letter
it
was
clear
that
larger
doses
of
mercury
would
be
necessary
and
accordingly
patrick
furnished
jones
with
pellets
containing
the
drug
in
such
quantities
that
jones
experimenting
with
one
of
them
became
ill
they
had
now
the
means
to
effect
gradual
death
but
as
mercury
leaves
traces
discernible
at
an
autopsy
it
was
decided
that
the
body
must
be
cremated
promptly
hence
the
cremation
letter
it
was
hoped
that
rice
might
drop
off
at
any
moment
owing
to
his
weakened
condition
and
in
anticipation
of
death
patrick
discontinued
his
visits
to
the
apartment
in
order
to
establish
a
satisfactory
alibi
jones
also
frequently
absented
himself
from
the
apartment
in
the
evenings
after
the
old
man
had
fallen
asleep
illustration
the
famous
letter
forged
by
patrick
which
requests
the
cremation
of
the
remains
of
the
supposed
writer
old
mr
rice
on
september
rice
had
an
attack
of
acute
indigestion
which
might
have
resulted
seriously
had
it
not
been
for
the
mercurial
pills
which
promptly
relieved
him
the
reader
should
observe
that
practically
all
of
this
testimony
comes
from
jones
there
is
no
extraneous
evidence
that
patrick
induced
the
giving
of
the
mercury
patrick
however
spread
false
rumors
as
to
rice
general
health
and
also
as
to
his
financial
condition
and
intentions
namely
that
rice
was
only
worth
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
that
those
who
expected
he
was
going
to
leave
his
money
to
the
institute
were
doomed
to
disappointment
but
neither
his
statements
about
rice
condition
nor
his
remarks
as
to
the
disposition
and
extent
of
his
property
are
inconsistent
with
a
mere
that
he
would
die
and
thus
leave
patrick
free
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
forgeries
there
now
occurred
however
an
event
which
may
well
have
played
a
part
in
inducing
patrick
to
supplement
forgery
by
murder
on
sunday
september
the
plant
of
the
merchants
and
planters
oil
company
of
houston
texas
of
which
rice
owned
per
cent
of
the
capital
stock
was
destroyed
by
fire
the
company
being
without
funds
to
rebuild
its
directors
telegraphed
to
rice
requesting
him
to
advance
the
money
the
amount
needed
was
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
if
rice
consented
all
the
available
funds
on
deposit
in
the
new
york
banks
upon
which
the
conspirators
relied
to
accomplish
their
object
would
be
exhausted
jones
endeavored
to
dissuade
the
old
man
from
advancing
the
money
but
without
effect
and
rice
sent
a
letter
to
houston
agreeing
to
supply
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
more
in
instalments
of
thousand
dollars
each
this
was
on
september
after
he
had
wired
to
the
same
effect
on
september
patrick
and
jones
suppressed
a
telegram
that
rice
would
advance
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
on
september
the
old
man
received
word
that
the
first
draft
in
conformity
with
his
telegram
of
september
had
been
drawn
and
would
arrive
in
new
york
on
the
jones
says
that
on
showing
this
to
patrick
the
latter
announced
that
rice
must
be
put
out
of
the
way
as
soon
as
possible
accordingly
on
september
and
jones
administered
larger
doses
of
mercury
than
usual
which
while
weakening
and
depressing
him
failed
to
cause
his
end
saturday
september
the
draft
was
presented
at
apartment
the
old
man
was
not
confined
to
his
bed
but
jones
told
the
bank
messenger
after
pretending
to
consult
him
that
rice
was
too
ill
to
attend
to
business
that
day
and
to
return
on
monday
that
night
jones
and
patrick
met
and
it
was
agreed
according
to
jones
that
rice
must
not
be
allowed
to
survive
until
monday
they
still
hoped
that
he
might
die
without
any
further
act
upon
their
part
but
jones
was
informed
by
curry
that
although
the
old
man
seemed
weak
and
under
a
great
mental
strain
he
nevertheless
thought
that
he
would
recover
this
curry
also
told
to
patrick
the
latter
calling
at
the
doctor
house
about
five
in
the
afternoon
you
think
rice
will
be
able
to
go
down
monday
morning
patrick
asked
you
had
better
wait
until
monday
morning
comes
replied
curry
do
you
think
he
will
be
able
to
go
down
town
next
week
persisted
the
lawyer
the
doctor
answered
in
the
affirmative
that
night
rice
slept
quietly
until
eight
sunday
morning
curry
called
and
found
him
in
excellent
condition
having
eaten
a
hearty
breakfast
his
heart
was
a
trifle
weak
but
it
was
sound
his
organs
were
all
working
normally
he
felt
no
pain
the
doctor
left
without
prescribing
any
medicine
stating
that
he
would
not
return
unless
called
and
expressing
his
opinion
that
the
patient
would
recover
this
was
about
eleven
and
jones
immediately
hastened
to
patrick
house
and
reported
the
conversation
it
was
clear
that
rice
death
would
not
occur
before
monday
morning
he
might
live
to
pay
over
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
long
enough
to
give
further
testimony
in
the
holt
litigation
and
thus
expose
the
whole
fraudulent
scheme
of
pretended
settlement
and
of
friendly
relations
with
the
lawyer
and
finally
perhaps
even
to
make
a
new
will
the
success
of
the
conspiracy
demanded
that
rice
should
die
that
night
did
he
die
naturally
was
his
death
caused
by
any
further
act
of
the
conspirators
did
jones
kill
him
by
means
of
chloroform
jones
story
is
that
patrick
supplied
him
with
some
oxalic
acid
which
was
to
be
mixed
with
powdered
ammonia
and
diluted
in
water
on
the
theory
that
it
was
preferable
to
chloroform
since
it
would
not
require
jones
presence
in
the
room
at
the
moment
of
death
jones
said
that
he
endeavored
to
administer
the
mixture
to
the
old
man
but
that
he
refused
to
take
it
jones
had
already
procured
the
chloroform
from
texas
as
has
been
stated
and
had
turned
it
over
to
patrick
he
says
that
that
afternoon
he
procured
this
from
patrick
who
told
him
how
to
administer
it
this
was
a
few
moments
after
six
rice
was
sleeping
soundly
the
colored
woman
who
did
the
housework
was
absent
for
the
day
and
the
rooms
were
deserted
he
saturated
a
sponge
with
chloroform
constructed
a
cone
out
of
a
towel
placed
the
sponge
in
the
cone
put
the
cone
over
the
sleeping
man
face
and
ran
out
of
the
room
and
waited
thirty
minutes
for
the
chloroform
to
complete
the
work
waiting
in
the
next
room
he
heard
the
door
bell
ring
and
ring
again
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
summons
in
point
of
fact
he
was
never
quite
sure
himself
whether
the
bell
was
not
the
creation
of
his
own
overwrought
brain
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
returned
to
the
bedroom
removed
the
cone
from
rice
face
and
saw
that
he
was
dead
then
after
burning
the
sponge
and
the
towel
in
the
kitchen
range
he
opened
the
windows
straightened
the
rooms
out
called
the
elevator
man
asked
him
to
send
for
curry
and
telephoned
to
patrick
that
rice
was
dead
jones
had
no
sooner
telephoned
patrick
that
rice
was
dead
than
the
lawyer
hastened
to
curry
and
within
forty
minutes
appeared
with
him
in
rice
apartments
assuming
complete
charge
summoning
an
undertaker
and
having
the
cremation
letter
at
hand
he
gave
orders
for
speedy
cremation
but
he
now
discovered
the
principal
mistake
in
his
calculations
he
had
omitted
to
investigate
the
length
of
time
required
to
heat
the
crematory
this
he
now
discovered
to
his
horror
to
be
hours
but
the
body
must
be
destroyed
the
undertaker
suggested
that
the
body
might
be
embalmed
while
the
crematory
was
being
heated
and
patrick
at
once
seized
upon
the
suggestion
and
gave
orders
to
that
effect
although
the
cremation
letter
sets
forth
specifically
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
rice
desired
cremation
was
his
horror
of
being
embalmed
the
body
was
embalmed
at
the
apartments
that
night
curry
innocently
supplying
the
certificate
of
death
from
old
age
and
weak
heart
and
as
immediate
cause
indigestion
followed
by
collocratal
diarrhoea
with
mental
worry
having
arranged
for
the
cremation
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
jones
and
patrick
rifled
the
trunk
in
which
rice
kept
his
papers
and
stuffed
them
in
a
satchel
which
patrick
bore
away
with
him
the
funeral
was
to
be
held
early
tuesday
morning
and
the
ashes
conveyed
by
jones
to
milwaukee
to
be
interred
near
the
body
of
rice
wife
while
the
relatives
should
not
be
notified
until
it
should
be
too
late
for
them
to
reach
new
york
the
next
step
was
to
secure
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
which
rice
had
on
deposit
patrick
had
already
forged
rice
name
to
blank
checks
on
swenson
and
the
fifth
avenue
trust
company
early
monday
morning
jones
with
patrick
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
directing
him
filled
out
the
body
of
the
checks
which
covered
all
but
ten
thousand
dollars
of
rice
deposits
these
consisted
of
one
for
thousand
dollars
and
one
for
thousand
dollars
on
swenson
one
for
thousand
dollars
and
another
for
one
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
on
the
trust
company
they
were
all
made
payable
to
the
order
of
patrick
and
dated
september
the
day
before
rice
death
one
of
the
drafts
on
the
fifth
avenue
trust
company
was
cashed
for
him
by
a
friend
named
potts
early
monday
morning
and
was
paid
without
suspicion
but
now
came
the
second
error
which
resulted
in
the
exposure
of
the
conspiracy
and
conviction
for
murder
jones
in
filling
out
the
thousand
dollar
check
on
swenson
had
in
his
nervousness
omitted
the
l
from
patrick
christian
name
so
that
the
check
read
abert
patrick
and
patrick
in
his
excitement
had
failed
to
notice
the
omission
or
attempt
to
obviate
it
by
extra
indorsement
this
thousand
dollar
swenson
check
was
intrusted
to
david
short
for
presentation
to
swenson
sons
for
certification
when
he
presented
it
wallace
the
clerk
recognized
jones
handwriting
in
the
body
of
it
and
thought
the
signature
looked
unnatural
he
took
it
to
a
rear
office
where
he
showed
it
to
wetherbee
who
was
the
person
whom
jones
had
approached
nine
months
before
with
a
request
that
he
join
the
conspiracy
to
manufacture
a
bogus
will
wetherbee
compared
the
signature
on
the
check
with
genuine
signatures
in
the
bank
and
returned
it
to
short
without
any
intimation
that
he
regarded
it
as
irregular
but
assigning
as
the
reason
the
defect
in
the
indorsement
short
thereupon
returned
the
check
to
patrick
who
supplied
the
necessary
supplementary
indorsement
and
telephoned
to
jones
what
had
occurred
instructing
him
to
say
that
the
check
was
all
right
in
case
the
swensons
should
inquire
half
an
hour
later
short
returned
to
swenson
where
the
check
was
examined
by
one
of
the
firm
rice
apartments
were
then
called
up
and
jones
said
that
the
checks
were
all
right
but
this
did
not
satisfy
swenson
so
he
instructed
wallace
to
call
up
the
apartment
again
and
insist
on
talking
to
rice
jones
delayed
replying
to
wallace
and
in
the
afternoon
called
up
patrick
on
the
telephone
inquiring
what
he
should
say
patrick
replied
that
he
would
have
to
say
that
rice
was
dead
and
in
accordance
with
this
jones
informed
swenson
that
rice
had
died
at
eight
the
previous
evening
it
was
thus
clear
to
swenson
that
although
the
maker
of
the
check
was
dead
patrick
a
lawyer
cognizant
of
that
fact
was
seeking
to
secure
payment
upon
it
for
jones
had
told
swenson
that
he
had
reported
rice
death
to
the
doctor
and
to
rice
lawyer
patrick
patrick
accompanied
by
potts
went
immediately
to
the
bank
where
swenson
informed
him
that
the
check
could
be
paid
only
to
the
administrator
patrick
replied
that
there
would
be
no
administrator
that
rice
had
left
no
property
in
this
state
and
informed
swenson
that
he
had
an
assignment
by
rice
to
himself
of
all
rice
securities
with
swenson
he
also
invited
swenson
to
the
funeral
later
in
the
day
patrick
attempted
to
obtain
possession
of
securities
in
the
safety
deposit
company
and
in
the
fifth
avenue
trust
company
by
presenting
forged
instruments
of
transfer
and
the
orders
heretofore
referred
to
but
after
some
delay
the
trust
companies
declined
him
access
the
conspiracy
had
begun
to
go
to
pieces
the
two
mistakes
and
the
failure
to
secure
funds
placed
patrick
in
a
dangerous
position
two
on
monday
afternoon
eighteen
hours
after
the
death
jones
at
patrick
direction
began
to
notify
the
relatives
that
rice
had
died
the
evening
before
and
that
the
funeral
would
take
place
the
following
morning
the
telegrams
to
baker
and
to
rice
in
texas
were
in
the
following
extraordinary
form
rice
died
eight
last
night
under
care
of
physicians
death
certificate
old
age
weak
heart
delirium
left
instructions
to
be
interred
in
milwaukee
with
wife
funeral
at
madison
avenue
it
is
significant
that
care
was
used
to
convey
the
information
that
the
death
was
a
natural
one
with
a
physician
in
attendance
that
the
body
was
to
be
interred
in
milwaukee
without
reference
to
the
cremation
this
may
well
have
been
so
that
if
any
suspicions
of
foul
play
should
arise
the
recipients
realizing
that
they
could
not
reach
new
york
in
time
to
arrest
matters
there
might
hasten
to
milwaukee
to
intercept
the
body
where
they
could
be
met
by
jones
with
the
cremation
letter
in
his
pocket
and
his
urn
of
ashes
under
his
arm
but
the
telegram
did
arouse
suspicion
and
baker
and
rice
immedately
wired
jones
as
follows
please
make
no
disposition
of
rice
remains
until
we
arrive
we
leave
arrive
new
york
thursday
morning
baker
also
instructed
meldrum
a
texan
then
in
new
york
to
with
jones
in
preserving
everything
intact
in
the
meantime
however
swenson
had
notified
his
attorneys
who
in
turn
had
informed
the
police
and
the
district
attorney
office
and
that
evening
at
about
eleven
james
gerard
accompanied
by
a
detective
who
posed
as
the
lawyer
clerk
interviewed
patrick
at
his
home
patrick
informed
gerard
that
he
had
an
assignment
of
all
property
and
also
a
will
of
rice
of
which
he
was
executor
this
was
the
first
reference
to
the
will
of
he
also
informed
gerard
that
he
would
not
receive
a
cent
under
its
provision
to
have
explained
the
real
terms
of
the
will
would
under
the
circumstances
have
excited
too
much
suspicion
yet
he
was
eager
to
let
the
swensons
know
that
as
executor
he
was
in
a
position
to
control
the
profitable
banking
business
that
would
arise
from
the
settlement
of
the
estate
in
the
meantime
four
headquarters
detectives
representing
themselves
as
lawyers
visited
the
apartments
patrick
hurried
to
madison
avenue
where
he
learned
of
presence
in
town
things
were
turning
out
far
from
the
way
in
which
he
had
expected
he
then
hastened
to
his
office
which
he
reached
about
one
in
the
morning
and
alone
destroyed
great
quantities
of
paper
attempting
to
dispose
of
them
through
the
toilet
bowl
which
was
so
clogged
that
the
water
flowed
out
upon
the
floor
necessitating
an
apology
to
the
janitor
in
the
silence
of
the
night
misgivings
came
upon
him
he
lost
his
nerve
and
at
two
in
the
morning
called
up
the
undertaker
and
revoked
the
signed
order
for
cremation
which
he
had
given
leaving
the
office
at
about
five
in
the
morning
he
first
visited
meyers
thence
proceeded
to
his
own
and
from
there
went
to
the
apartments
which
he
reached
at
eight
here
he
found
the
detectives
who
had
been
on
guard
since
early
morning
to
forestall
any
attempt
to
remove
the
body
at
the
funeral
itself
he
attempted
to
conciliate
adverse
interests
and
to
win
witnesses
for
his
purpose
he
had
begun
to
do
this
the
very
night
that
rice
had
died
when
he
told
the
elevator
man
that
he
was
remembered
in
rice
will
he

the
detectives
now
informed
patrick
that
he
was
wanted
at
headquarters
and
patrick
invited
potts
to
accompany
him
informing
the
latter
that
the
police
suspected
that
there
was
something
unnatural
in
the
cause
of
death
but
that
he
could
explain
satisfactorily
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
such
intimation
had
been
made
to
him
by
the
police
or
anyone
else
at
police
headquarters
after
an
interview
with
inspector
mcclusky
he
was
permitted
to
go
his
way
patrick
returned
to
rice
apartments
sent
for
short
and
meyers
and
conferred
with
them
there
he
took
this
occasion
to
tell
maria
scott
the
colored
woman
who
worked
in
the
apartment
that
she
was
suspected
of
having
poisoned
rice
and
that
she
had
better
say
nothing
about
his
death
jones
told
her
that
she
was
remembered
in
the
will
and
that
it
would
be
worth
her
while
to
stand
by
himself
and
patrick
who
would
see
that
she
was
taken
care
of
meanwhile
the
coroner
had
sent
the
body
to
the
morgue
for
autopsy
the
autopsy
was
performed
on
tuesday
hours
after
death
occurred
by
donlin
a
coroner
physician
in
the
presence
of
williams
also
a
coroner
physician
and
of
professor
witthaus
an
expert
chemist
the
two
physicians
testified
at
the
trial
that
the
organs
of
the
body
except
the
lungs
were
normal
in
condition
save
as
affected
by
the
embalming
fluid
they
and
professor
witthaus
agreed
in
their
testimony
that
the
lungs
were
congested
donlin
spoke
of
their
being
congested
all
over
while
williams
characterized
it
as
an
intense
congestion
of
the
lungs
coextensive
with
them
outside
of
the
lungs
they
found
no
evidence
of
disease
to
account
for
death
and
beyond
the
congestion
these
showed
nothing
except
a
small
patch
of
consolidated
tissue
about
the
size
of
a
cent
piece
they
testified
in
effect
that
nothing
save
the
inhalation
of
some
gaseous
irritant
could
have
produced
such
a
general
congestion
and
that
the
patch
of
tissue
referred
to
was
insufficient
to
account
for
the
amount
of
congestion
present
donlin
could
not
testify
what
the
proximate
cause
of
death
was
but
was
firm
in
his
opinion
that
no
cause
for
it
was
observable
in
the
other
vital
organs
in
this
williams
concurred
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
chloroform
would
act
as
an
irritant
upon
the
lungs
and
cause
precisely
that
general
congestion
observable
in
the
case
of
the
deceased
professor
witthaus
testified
that
his
analysis
revealed
the
presence
of
mercury
obtained
as
calomel
and
while
the
amount
was
not
sufficient
to
cause
death
its
presence
indicated
that
a
larger
quantity
had
existed
in
life
the
embalming
fluid
had
contained
no
mercury
and
he
and
donlin
agreed
that
the
embalming
fluid
would
have
no
effect
upon
the
lungs
beyond
a
tendency
to
bleach
them
in
other
words
the
people
evidence
was
to
the
effect
that
no
cause
of
death
was
observable
from
a
medical
examination
of
the
body
save
the
congestion
stated
to
exist
in
the
lungs
and
that
this
might
have
been
caused
by
chloroform
thursday
morning
baker
and
a
rice
the
brother
of
the
deceased
arrived
in
new
york
patrick
showed
them
the
cremation
letter
and
inasmuch
as
they
took
a
neutral
position
in
the
matter
ordered
the
cremation
to
proceed
and
accordingly
it
took
place
that
very
day
he
also
endeavored
to
win
the
confidence
of
baker
but
succeeded
in
accomplishing
little
he
finally
gave
the
latter
a
copy
of
the
will
and
the
original
will
of
he
also
informed
baker
that
he
had
taken
a
large
number
of
papers
from
rice
apartments
and
turned
over
to
him
a
considerable
number
of
them
he
also
surrendered
on
friday
the
two
swenson
checks
after
considerable
discussion
baker
told
patrick
flatly
that
he
would
never
consent
to
the
probate
of
the
will
that
he
was
satisfied
that
the
will
was
the
last
will
of
rice
and
that
he
would
insist
upon
its
being
probated
to
which
patrick
replied
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
did
not
know
but
that
the
probate
of
the
will
would
suit
him
just
as
well
as
the
probate
of
the
will
that
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
and
that
so
far
as
the
rice
institute
was
concerned
he
was
prepared
to
give
baker
from
three
to
five
million
dollars
for
it
or
any
other
sum
baker
might
name
these
negotiations
and
conferences
continued
until
the
fourth
of
october
patrick
yielding
step
by
step
until
he
had
divested
himself
of
all
control
of
the
documents
and
securities
meantime
sufficient
evidence
having
been
secured
patrick
and
jones
were
arrested
on
a
charge
of
forgery
and
held
for
the
grand
jury
bail
was
fixed
at
ten
thousand
dollars
each
but
was
not
forthcoming
on
october
house
patrick
lawyer
visited
patrick
and
jones
in
the
tombs
jones
says
that
after
patrick
had
talked
to
house
the
former
called
jones
to
one
corner
of
the
room
and
told
him
that
house
insisted
on
knowing
definitely
whether
a
crime
had
been
committed
and
directed
jones
to
tell
house
that
a
murder
had
been
committed
but
that
he
patrick
was
not
concerned
in
it
this
jones
declined
to
do
without
implicating
patrick
the
two
prisoners
then
returned
to
house
and
jones
says
that
he
informed
house
that
he
had
killed
rice
by
chloroform
and
gave
him
the
same
story
which
he
told
on
the
witness
stand
after
this
jones
apparently
lost
his
nerve
and
told
patrick
that
he
intended
to
commit
suicide
this
idea
patrick
encouraged
agreeing
that
they
should
both
do
it
at
about
the
same
time
on
the
of
october
jones
made
a
statement
to
assistant
district
attorney
osborne
which
was
in
large
part
false
and
in
which
he
endeavored
to
exonerate
himself
entirely
from
complicity
in
any
of
the
crimes
and
in
which
he
charged
the
actual
administration
of
the
chloroform
to
patrick
four
days
later
osborne
sent
for
him
and
told
him
he
had
lied
upon
which
jones
became
confused
continued
to
persist
in
some
of
his
statements
qualified
others
and
withdrew
still
others
he
was
completely
unnerved
and
that
night
attempted
by
means
of
a
knife
which
patrick
had
supplied
him
to
cut
his
throat
the
attempt
was
a
failure
and
he
was
removed
to
bellevue
hospital
where
he
remained
until
november
he
then
finally
gave
the
statement
which
corresponded
with
his
testimony
upon
the
trial
and
which
jibed
with
all
the
circumstances
and
evidence
known
to
the
district
attorney
did
patrick
conspire
with
jones
to
murder
rice
what
corroboration
is
there
of
jones
story
that
he
killed
rice
under
patrick
direction
first
what
proof
is
there
that
murder
was
committed
roughly
that
jones
so
swore
that
rice
died
at
the
time
alleged
that
he
did
not
die
from
disease
but
that
he
died
from
a
congestion
of
the
lungs
which
could
have
occurred
only
in
the
case
of
a
living
organism
by
the
administration
of
some
such
irritant
as
chloroform
that
some
one
therefore
must
have
killed
him
and
that
jones
alone
had
the
opportunity
second
what
proof
is
there
that
patrick
directed
the
murder
evidence
of
an
elaborate
conspiracy
as
briefly
heretofore
set
forth
which
contemplated
the
of
rice
of
course
patrick
wanted
rice
to
die
if
patrick
was
not
implicated
in
the
killing
what
motive
had
jones
to
commit
the
deed
why
did
rice
die
at
the
precise
psychological
moment
which
would
enable
patrick
to
prevent
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
on
deposit
being
diverted
to
texas
and
finally
why
did
patrick
prepare
a
forged
cremation
letter
for
the
destruction
of
the
body
if
the
conspiracy
contemplated
a
death
nothing
could
be
of
greater
value
to
the
two
parties
concerned
than
the
means
of
proving
that
the
death
was
unnatural
this
in
the
most
abbreviated
form
is
the
case
against
patrick
space
forbids
any
reference
to
his
elaborate
and
ingenious
defense
which
was
based
entirely
on
an
alleged
complete
failure
of
corroboration
of
jones
testimony
starting
with
the
premise
that
the
word
of
a
murderer
and
scoundrel
was
valueless
as
proof
he
contended
that
there
was
no
adequate
evidence
that
death
was
felonious
and
that
the
congestion
of
the
lungs
could
have
been
and
was
caused
by
the
embalming
fluid
and
was
only
attributed
to
the
chloroform
after
jones
had
given
his
final
version
of
how
the
murder
was
accomplished
technically
the
case
against
patrick
was
not
a
strong
one
dramatically
it
was
overwhelming
his
own
failure
to
testify
and
his
refusal
to
allow
his
lawyer
house
to
relate
what
passed
between
them
in
the
tombs
remain
significant
although
not
evidence
proper
for
a
jury
to
consider
wherever
lawyers
shall
get
together
there
the
patrick
case
will
be
discussed
with
its
strong
points
and
its
weak
ones
its
technicalities
and
its
tactics
and
the
ethics
of
the
liberation
of
jones
the
actual
murderer
now
long
since
vanished
into
the
obscurity
from
which
he
came
on
the
one
hand
stands
a
public
convinced
of
patrick
guilt
and
on
the
other
the
convicted
lifer
pointing
a
lean
finger
at
the
valet
jones
and
stubbornly
repeating
i
am
innocent
footnote
in
the
governor
of
new
york
commuted
the
death
sentence
of
albert
patrick
to
life
imprisonment
and
the
most
extraordinary
struggle
in
the
legal
history
of
the
state
on
the
part
of
a
convicted
murderer
for
his
own
life
came
to
an
end
the
defendant
in
the
death
house
at
sing
sing
had
invoked
every
expedient
to
escape
punishment
and
by
the
use
of
his
knowledge
had
even
saved
a
fellow
prisoner
mike
brush
from
the
electric
chair
x
a
flight
into
texas
the
flight
and
extradition
of
charles
dodge
unquestionably
involved
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
battles
with
justice
in
the
history
of
the
criminal
law
the
funds
at
the
disposal
of
those
who
were
interested
in
procuring
the
prisoner
escape
were
unlimited
in
extent
and
the
arch
conspirator
for
whose
safety
dodge
was
spirited
away
was
so
influential
in
political
and
criminal
circles
that
he
was
all
but
successful
in
defying
the
prosecutor
of
new
york
county
even
supported
as
the
latter
was
by
the
military
and
judicial
arm
of
the
united
states
government
for
at
the
time
that
dodge
made
his
escape
a
whisper
from
hummel
was
enough
to
make
the
dry
bones
of
many
a
powerful
and
ostensibly
respectable
official
rattle
and
the
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
in
terror
who
could
accomplish
that
in
which
the
law
was
powerless
hummel
who
could
drive
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
persons
against
whom
not
a
shadow
of
suspicion
had
previously
rested
hummel
who
dictated
to
the
chiefs
of
police
of
foreign
cities
what
they
should
or
should
not
do
in
certain
cases
and
who
could
at
the
beckoning
of
his
little
finger
summon
to
his
offices
in
the
new
york
life
building
whither
his
firm
had
removed
from
centre
street
the
most
prominent
of
lawyers
the
most
eminent
of
citizens
surely
none
but
hummel
and
now
hummel
was
fighting
for
his
own
life
the
only
man
that
stood
between
him
and
the
iron
bars
of
blackwell
island
was
charles
dodge
the
man
whom
he
had
patted
on
the
knee
in
his
office
and
called
a
mascot
when
quite
in
the
nature
of
business
he
needed
a
little
perjury
to
assist
a
wealthy
client
hummel
in
terror
called
into
play
every
resource
upon
which
during
forty
years
of
practice
his
tiny
tentacles
had
fastened
who
shall
say
that
while
he
made
a
show
of
enjoying
himself
nightly
with
his
accustomed
in
the
tenderloin
he
did
not
feel
confident
that
in
the
end
this
peril
would
disappear
like
the
others
which
had
from
time
to
time
threatened
him
during
his
criminal
career
but
hummel
was
fully
aware
of
the
tenacity
of
the
man
who
had
resolved
to
rid
new
york
of
his
malign
influence
his
nemesis
was
following
him
in
his
dreams
if
he
ever
dreamed
it
probably
took
the
shape
of
the
square
shouldered
district
attorney
in
the
shadow
of
whose
office
building
the
little
shyster
practised
his
profession
had
he
been
told
that
this
nemesis
was
in
reality
a
jovial
little
man
with
a
round
ruddy
face
and
twinkling
blue
eyes
he
would
have
laughed
as
heartily
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
laugh
yet
such
was
the
fact
a
little
man
who
looked
less
like
a
detective
than
a
commercial
traveller
selling
oil
or
some
other
cheerful
concoction
with
manners
as
gentle
and
a
voice
as
soft
as
a
spring
zephyr
who
always
took
off
his
hat
when
he
came
into
a
business
office
seemingly
bashful
to
the
point
of
was
the
one
who
snatched
charles
dodge
from
the
borders
of
mexico
and
held
him
in
an
iron
grip
when
every
influence
upon
which
hummel
could
call
for
aid
from
crooked
police
officials
corrupt
judges
and
a
gang
of
cutthroats
under
the
guise
of
a
sheriff
posse
were
fighting
for
his
release
jesse
blocher
is
not
employed
in
new
york
county
and
for
business
reasons
he
does
not
wish
his
present
address
known
when
he
comes
to
new
york
he
occasionally
drops
into
the
writer
office
for
a
cigar
and
a
friendly
chat
about
old
times
and
as
he
sits
there
and
talks
so
modestly
and
with
such
quiet
humor
about
his
adventures
with
the
texas
rangers
among
the
plains
of
the
lone
star
state
it
is
hard
even
for
one
who
knows
the
truth
to
realize
that
this
man
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
detectives
or
rather
one
of
the
most
capable
resourceful
adroit
and
knights
of
adventure
who
ever
set
forth
upon
a
seemingly
impossible
errand
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
just
how
the
district
attorney
discovered
the
existence
of
jesse
as
we
knew
him
it
is
enough
to
say
that
on
saturday
morning
july
he
was
furnished
with
the
proper
credentials
and
given
instructions
to
proceed
at
once
to
new
orleans
louisiana
and
locate
if
it
were
humanly
possible
to
do
so
charles
dodge
under
indictment
for
perjury
and
potentially
the
chief
witness
against
abraham
hummel
on
a
charge
of
conspiracy
he
was
told
briefly
and
to
the
point
that
in
spite
of
the
official
reports
from
the
police
of
both
new
york
city
and
new
orleans
to
the
contrary
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
dodge
was
living
although
not
registered
as
a
guest
at
the
charles
hotel
in
the
latter
city
a
partial
and
inaccurate
description
of
dodge
was
given
him
and
he
was
warned
to
use
extreme
caution
to
prevent
any
knowledge
of
his
mission
from
being
made
known
once
dodge
had
been
discovered
he
was
to
keep
him
under
surveillance
and
wire
new
york
immediately
accordingly
jesse
left
the
city
upon
the
same
day
at
and
arrived
two
days
later
at
on
monday
morning
at
new
orleans
where
he
went
directly
to
the
charles
hotel
registered
and
was
assigned
to
room
number
on
the
fifth
floor
somewhere
in
the
hotel
dodge
was
secreted
the
question
was
how
to
find
him
for
an
hour
jesse
sat
in
the
hotel
foyer
and
meditatively
watched
the
visitors
come
and
go
but
saw
no
sign
of
his
quarry
then
he
arose
put
on
his
hat
and
hunted
out
a
stationery
store
where
for
two
cents
he
bought
a
envelope
he
then
visited
a
office
secured
the
owner
business
card
and
wrote
a
note
on
its
back
to
dodge
offering
him
cheap
transportation
to
any
point
that
he
might
desire
armed
with
this
he
returned
to
the
hotel
walked
to
the
desk
glanced
casually
over
a
number
of
telegrams
exposed
in
a
rack
and
when
the
clerk
turned
his
back
placed
the
note
addressed
to
charles
dodge
unobserved
upon
the
counter
the
office
was
a
busy
one
guests
were
constantly
depositing
their
keys
and
receiving
their
mail
and
even
as
jesse
stood
there
watching
developments
the
clerk
turned
round
found
the
note
and
promptly
placed
it
in
box
number
the
very
simple
scheme
had
worked
and
quite
unconsciously
the
clerk
had
indicated
the
number
of
the
room
occupied
by
dodge
jesse
lost
no
time
in
ascending
to
the
fourth
floor
viewed
room
number
returned
to
the
desk
told
the
clerk
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
room
assigned
him
and
requested
that
he
be
given
either
room
number
or
one
of
which
he
stated
that
he
had
occupied
on
a
previous
visit
after
some
discussion
the
clerk
allotted
him
room
number
which
was
almost
directly
opposite
that
occupied
by
dodge
and
the
detective
at
once
took
up
his
task
of
watching
for
the
fugitive
to
appear
within
the
hour
the
door
opened
and
dodge
and
a
companion
who
subsequently
proved
to
be
bracken
alias
bradley
an
agent
employed
by
howe
and
hummel
left
the
room
went
to
the
elevator
and
descended
to
the
upon
the
second
floor
jesse
watched
until
they
were
safely
ensconced
at
breakfast
and
then
returned
to
the
fourth
floor
where
he
tipped
the
chambermaid
told
her
that
he
had
left
his
key
at
the
office
and
induced
her
to
unlock
the
door
of
room
number
which
she
did
under
the
supposition
that
jesse
was
the
person
who
had
left
the
chamber
in
dodge
company
the
contents
of
the
room
convinced
jesse
that
he
had
found
dodge
for
he
discovered
there
two
grips
bearing
dodge
name
as
well
as
several
letters
on
the
table
addressed
to
him
the
detective
returned
to
the
hall
and
had
a
little
talk
with
the
maid
the
old
gentleman
with
you
has
been
quite
sick
she
said
how
is
he
he
is
some
better
answered
jesse
yes
he
does
look
better
she
added
but
he
was
powerful
sick
yesterday
why
he
has
been
out
of
his
room
befo
five
or
six
days
this
statement
was
corroborated
by
dodge
physical
appearance
for
he
looked
haggard
and
worn
jesse
was
now
confident
that
he
had
found
dodge
in
spite
of
the
reports
of
the
new
orleans
police
to
the
contrary
and
he
was
also
reasonably
sure
that
the
fugitive
was
too
sick
to
leave
the
hotel
immediately
he
therefore
telegraphed
his
superiors
that
he
had
discovered
dodge
and
that
the
latter
was
ill
at
the
charles
hotel
at
three
in
the
afternoon
jesse
received
a
wire
from
new

claims
party
not

weeks

and
wire
at
once
jesse
at
once
replied
no
question
as
to
identity
and
presence
here
at
this
time
he
now
took
up
the
task
of
keeping
his
quarry
under
absolute
surveillance
day
and
night
which
duty
from
that
moment
he
continued
for
a
period
of
nearly
ten
months
during
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
and
throughout
the
night
dodge
and
bracken
remained
in
room
number
and
during
the
evening
were
visited
by
several
strangers
including
a
officer
from
the
new
orleans
police
little
hummel
dining
in
long
acre
square
in
the
glare
of
broadway
was
pressing
some
invisible
button
that
transmitted
the
power
of
his
influence
even
to
the
police
government
of
a
city
two
thousand
miles
away
the
following
day
january
at
about
in
the
morning
dodge
and
bracken
descended
to
the
lobby
bracken
departed
from
the
hotel
leaving
dodge
to
pay
the
bill
at
the
cashier
window
and
jesse
heard
him
order
a
cab
for
the
sunset
limited
on
the
southern
pacific
railroad
and
direct
that
his
baggage
be
removed
from
his
room
jesse
did
the
same
in
the
meantime
bracken
returned
and
promptly
at
left
for
the
railroad
station
in
a
cab
with
dodge
jesse
followed
in
another
as
the
two
passed
through
the
gates
the
detective
caught
a
glimpse
of
ticket
and
saw
that
it
had
been
issued
by
the
mexican
national
railway
retiring
to
the
telegraph
office
in
the
station
he
wired
new
york
as
follows
bird
sunset
limited
destination
not
known
i
am
with
him
he
then
hastily
purchased
a
ticket
to
houston
texas
and
boarded
the
train
dodge
companion
had
bidden
him
as
the
engine
started
and
jesse
task
now
became
that
of
ferreting
out
dodge
destination
after
some
difficulty
he
managed
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
whole
of
the
fugitive
ticket
and
thus
discovered
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
city
of
mexico
via
eagle
pass
texas
while
from
the
pullman
conductor
he
learned
that
dodge
had
secured
accommodation
as
far
as
san
antonio
texas
only
so
far
all
was
well
he
knew
dodge
but
dodge
did
not
know
him
and
later
on
in
the
afternoon
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
a
long
talk
with
his
quarry
in
the
observation
car
where
they
amiably
discussed
together
current
events
and
argued
politics
with
the
same
vehemence
as
if
they
had
been
commercial
travellers
thrown
fortuitously
into
each
company
dodge
however
cleverly
evaded
any
reference
to
his
destination
when
the
train
reached
morgan
city
louisiana
at
which
was
the
first
stop
jesse
wired
new
york
as
follows
on
sunset
limited
with
friend
he
has
transportation
to
the
city
of
mexico
via
eagle
pass
where
i

now
journeying

answer
to
beaumont
texas
later
in
the
afternoon
he
sent
an
additional
message
from
lafayette
louisiana
have
seen
transportation
of
friend
and
am
positive
of
destination
dodge
was
occupying
section
of
the
sleeping
car
capitola
and
as
became
an
invalid
retired
early
at
beaumont
jesse
failed
to
receive
any
reply
to
his
various
messages
and
when
the
train
arrived
at
houston
no
word
came
from
new
york
until
it
was
almost
the
time
of
departure
waiting
until
practically
the
last
moment
jesse
hurried
through
the
gates
of
the
union
station
at
houston
and
bought
a
ticket
to
san
antonio
as
he
was
leaving
the
ticket
window
night
chief
of
police
john
howard
and
two
officers
came
hurrying
up
inquiring
anxiously
for
mr
jesse
the
reinforcements
had
arrived
outside
on
the
track
the
sunset
limited
was
just
getting
under
way
the
first
frantic
puffs
were
being
vomited
from
the
funnel
inside
dodge
was
sleeping
peacefully
in
his
berth
jesse
accompanied
by
chief
howard
hurried
up
to
the
conductor
who
was
about
to
swing
on
to
the
steps
of
the
sleeper
and
ordered
him
to
hold
the
train
till
the
fugitive
could
be
removed
after
some
argument
the
conductor
grumblingly
complied
and
dodge
was
aroused
from
pleasant
dreams
of
the
creole
quarter
to
the
cold
reality
of
being
dragged
out
of
bed
by
a
policeman
he
was
unceremoniously
hustled
out
of
the
sleeping
car
into
a
carriage
and
taken
to
where
he
admitted
his
identity
and
remarked
i
know
what
i
am
wanted
for
but
i
will
never
return
to
new
york
in
his
grip
was
found
the
sum
of
as
well
as
numerous
letters
from
the
law
firm
of
howe
and
hummel
and
a
quantity
of
newspaper
clippings
relative
to
his
case
dodge
pleaded
with
chief
howard
not
to
lock
him
up
urging
that
he
was
a
sick
man
and
offering
a
goodly
sum
if
he
might
be
taken
to
a
hotel
and
guarded
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
but
what
went
in
new
orleans
did
not
go
in
houston
and
the
best
that
dodge
could
get
for
himself
was
a
cot
in
the
ladies
detention
room
on
the
second
floor
of
the
jail
early
the
following
morning
jesse
visited
police
and
for
the
first
time
met
george
ellis
chief
of
police
of
houston
for
whom
he
will
always
have
a
feeling
of
deep
gratitude
for
his
enthusiastic
cooperation
and
loyalty
in
the
many
stirring
events
that
followed
dodge
now
received
a
telegram
from
new
york
which
was
submitted
to
jesse
before
reaching
the
prisoner
to
the
effect
that
howe
and
hummel
were
sending
on
an
attorney
to
aid
the
fugitive
in
resisting
extradition
and
informing
him
that
they
had
employed
hunt
and
meyers
as
attorneys
to
look
out
for
his
welfare
these
last
immediately
jumped
medias
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
secured
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
norman
kitrell
district
judge
of
harris
county
texas
returnable
the
following
morning
the
next
day
january
kitrell
released
dodge
from
custody
jesse
had
anticipated
this
and
immediately
swore
out
another
warrant
with
the
result
that
the
prisoner
was
rearrested
before
he
left
the
court
room
meantime
the
dodge
interests
retained
another
firm
of
lawyers
andrews
and
ball
who
on
the
following
day
secured
a
second
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
judge
ashe
the
result
of
the
first
engagement
thus
being
a
draw
counsel
on
both
sides
agreed
that
this
writ
should
not
be
returnable
for
six
days
during
this
period
district
attorney
jerome
employed
baker
botts
parker
and
garwood
to
represent
him
and
secured
from
governor
odell
at
albany
a
requisition
on
governor
lanham
of
texas
for
the
extradition
of
the
prisoner
which
he
entrusted
to
detective
sergeant
herlihy
of
the
new
york
police
herlihy
reached
houston
with
the
papers
on
the
evening
of
january
and
on
the
same
train
with
him
came
abraham
kaffenburgh
a
member
of
the
law
firm
of
howe
and
hummel
and
a
nephew
of
the
latter
likewise
also
came
bracken
still
styling
himself
bradley
and
from
now
on
bracken
was
the
inseparable
companion
guide
philosopher
and
friend
of
the
unfortunate
dodge
whose
continued
existence
upon
this
earth
had
become
such
a
menace
to
the
little
lawyer
in
new
york
herlihy
accompanied
by
judge
garwood
proceeded
direct
to
austin
where
they
found
dodge
already
represented
by
andrews
and
ball
who
at
the
hearing
before
governor
lanham
made
a
strong
effort
to
induce
that
executive
to
refuse
to
honor
the
requisition
of
the
governor
of
new
york
this
effort
failed
and
governor
lanham
issued
his
warrant
but
herlihy
had
no
sooner
returned
to
houston
for
the
purpose
of
taking
possession
of
the
prisoner
than
he
was
served
with
an
injunction
enjoining
him
together
with
chief
of
police
ellis
from
taking
dodge
into
custody
pending
a
hearing
upon
a
new
habeas
corpus
which
had
been
issued
by
judge
waller
burns
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas
this
new
writ
was
returnable
february
after
exhaustive
but
futile
argument
by
the
counsel
for
dodge
judge
burns
remanded
the
prisoner
to
herlihy
custody
to
be
returned
to
the
state
of
new
york
but
this
decision
had
no
sooner
been
rendered
than
an
appeal
was
taken
therefrom
by
dodge
lawyers
and
the
prisoner
released
upon
bail
fixed
at
twenty
thousand
dollars
during
this
period
dodge
was
quartered
under
guard
at
the
rice
hotel
in
houston
and
the
day
following
the
argument
the
bail
was
put
up
in
cash
and
dodge
released
from
custody
in
the
meantime
however
jesse
knowing
that
no
sum
however
large
would
deter
hummel
from
spiriting
dodge
out
of
the
country
had
made
his
arrangements
to
secure
a
new
extradition
warrant
from
the
governor
of
texas
so
that
if
the
prisoner
did
succeed
in
getting
beyond
the
southern
district
of
the
federal
court
of
texas
he
could
be
seized
and
conveyed
to
new
york
of
course
some
one
had
to
keep
watch
over
dodge
while
jesse
hurried
to
austin
to
see
the
governor
and
it
was
decided
to
leave
sergeant
herlihy
reinforced
by
a
number
of
local
detectives
for
that
purpose
but
while
the
watchful
jesse
was
away
bracken
proceeded
to
get
busy
in
the
good
old
howe
and
hummel
fashion
lots
of
people
that
herlihy
had
never
seen
before
turned
up
and
protested
that
he
was
the
finest
fellow
they
had
ever
met
and
as
herlihy
was
in
fact
a
good
fellow
he
made
them
welcome
and
dined
and
wined
at
their
expense
until
he
woke
up
in
the
menger
hotel
in
san
antonio
and
inquired
where
he
was
jesse
meantime
had
returned
from
austin
to
discover
that
dodge
with
his
companions
kaffenburgh
and
bracken
had
slipped
out
of
houston
early
in
the
morning
of
february
after
disposing
of
herlihy
and
eluding
the
watchfulness
of
herlihy
assistants
hummel
was
leading
and
by
ten
the
next
morning
dodge
and
his
comrades
were
on
board
an
english
merchantman
lying
in
the
harbor
of
galveston
later
in
the
same
day
the
hummel
interests
chartered
from
the
southern
pacific
railroad
for
the
sum
of
three
thousand
dollars
the
tug
to
which
dodge
was
now
transferred
for
the
purpose
of
being
conveyed
to
the
port
of
tampico
in
the
republic
of
mexico
but
here
hummel
wires
became
crossed
with
jerome
and
unfortunately
for
the
little
lawyer
the
persons
from
whom
the
tug
had
been
leased
turned
out
to
be
closely
allied
with
the
prosecution
interests
with
the
result
that
the
captain
of
the
tug
was
instructed
by
his
superiors
under
no
consideration
to
put
into
any
mexican
port
but
on
the
contrary
to
delay
his
departure
from
the
harbor
of
galveston
for
a
period
of
two
days
and
then
to
proceed
only
as
far
as
brownsville
texas
where
he
should
compel
the
debarkation
of
the
fugitive
the
captain
who
was
a
good
sport
as
well
as
a
good
officer
promptly
threw
himself
into
the
part
and
told
bracken
and
kaffenburgh
that
it
was
evident
from
the
barometer
that
a
severe
storm
was
approaching
which
must
have
had
a
sinister
implication
to
these
two
unfortunate
gentlemen
and
that
he
could
not
think
of
putting
to
sea
once
the
storm
had
blown
over
the
tug
started
out
across
the
blue
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
but
now
bracken
and
kaffenburgh
were
informed
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
impossible
to
consider
putting
into
any
port
of
the
republic
of
mexico
since
to
do
so
would
cause
international
complications
and
compel
the
revocation
of
the
captain
license
in
desperation
the
hummel
interests
offered
the
captain
five
thousand
dollars
in
cash
to
disregard
his
instructions
and
put
into
tampico
but
the
worthy
was
adamant
it
was
probably
worth
five
thousand
dollars
to
him
to
see
three
gentry
of
this
pattern
so
much
put
about
while
dodge
and
his
accomplices
were
dallying
in
the
harbor
of
galveston
jesse
was
taking
advantage
of
his
opportunity
to
proceed
at
once
by
railroad
to
alice
texas
which
at
that
time
was
the
furthermost
southern
point
reached
by
any
railway
in
the
direction
of
brownsville
on
his
arrival
he
at
once
applied
to
captain
john
hughes
commanding
company
d
of
the
texas
rangers
who
received
him
with
great
joy
and
ordered
a
detachment
of
the
rangers
to
meet
the
tug
at
point
isabella
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
river
on
the
border
of
mexico
in
the
meantime
jesse
started
on
a
toilsome
stage
journey
to
brownsville
across
one
hundred
and
seventy
miles
of
desert
which
occupied
two
days
and
nights
and
necessitated
his
going
without
sleep
for
that
period
during
the
trip
jesse
heard
no
word
of
english
and
had
as
his
associates
only
mexican
cattlemen
every
fifteen
miles
a
fresh
relay
of
broncos
was
hitched
to
the
stage
and
after
a
few
moments
rest
the
misery
began
again
jesse
had
been
hurrying
toward
brownsville
by
stage
while
dodge
kaffenburgh
and
bracken
were
landing
at
point
isabella
where
they
were
kept
under
close
surveillance
by
sergeant
tom
ross
of
the
rangers
thence
they
took
the
train
to
brownsville
registering
at
the
miller
house
under
the
assumed
names
of
dougherty
koontzman
and
barker
all
of
oklahoma
but
although
they
knew
it
not
sergeant
tom
was
at
their
elbow
and
had
dodge
attempted
to
cross
the
border
into
mexico
he
would
instantly
have
been
placed
under
arrest
as
brownsville
was
within
the
southern
district
of
the
federal
court
of
texas
jesse
decided
not
to
arrest
dodge
until
he
should
actually
attempt
flight
and
when
dodge
and
his
companions
on
the
following
morning
february
entered
the
stage
the
same
upon
which
jesse
had
arrived
and
started
for
alice
jesse
and
tom
ross
procured
the
best
horses
they
could
find
and
started
after
them
keeping
just
in
sight
of
the
stage
dodge
intention
in
making
this
move
was
to
take
the
mexican
international
railway
at
alice
and
cross
over
to
mexico
via
laredo
jesse
and
ross
covered
the
miles
from
brownsville
to
santa
la
cruz
ranch
by
four
in
the
afternoon
which
was
fairly
strenuous
work
for
a
new
york
detective
and
here
found
themselves
so
sore
and
exhausted
from
their
ride
that
they
were
glad
to
hire
a
pair
of
horses
and
buggy
with
which
to
complete
the
journey
to
alice
luckily
they
were
able
to
get
into
telephonic
communication
with
various
ranch
owners
along
the
road
and
arrange
to
have
fresh
relays
of
horses
supplied
to
them
every
twenty
miles
and
here
also
jesse
called
up
captain
hughes
at
alice
and
suggested
that
he
substitute
for
the
regular
night
clerk
at
the
city
hotel
one
of
the
privates
of
the
rangers
by
the
name
of
harrod
dodge
and
his
companions
arrived
in
alice
on
february
and
as
jesse
had
anticipated
repaired
at
once
to
the
city
hotel
where
inasmuch
as
they
were
dry
from
the
dust
of
their
trip
and
depressed
by
lack
of
society
they
entered
at
once
into
an
enthusiastic
and
confidential
friendship
with
the
man
behind
the
counter
in
the
hotel
office
sublimely
ignorant
that
they
were
unfolding
to
a
member
of
the
texas
rangers
all
their
most
secret
intentions
harrod
was
just
as
glad
to
see
dodge
as
dodge
apparently
was
to
see
harrod
and
kindly
offered
to
assist
the
fugitive
to
get
into
mexico
in
any
way
that
the
latter
desired
dodge
for
his
part
took
advantage
of
his
usefulness
to
the
extent
of
requesting
him
to
purchase
them
railroad
tickets
the
plan
being
to
leave
alice
the
following
morning
for
monterey
mexico
three
hours
after
the
stage
bearing
dodge
and
his
party
pulled
up
at
the
city
hotel
tom
ross
and
jesse
drove
in
behind
a
pair
of
broncos
at
two
in
the
morning
jesse
had
had
no
sleep
of
any
sort
and
no
proper
nourishment
for
five
days
and
had
just
strength
enough
left
to
drag
himself
up
one
flight
of
stairs
and
tumble
into
bed
from
which
he
did
not
emerge
for
many
hours
in
the
meantime
day
broke
and
dodge
kaffenburgh
and
bracken
having
breakfasted
drove
comfortably
down
to
the
international
railway
station
and
settled
themselves
in
the
smoker
but
they
had
no
sooner
given
this
direct
evidence
of
their
intention
before
captain
hughes
entered
and
placed
dodge
under
arrest
the
latter
surprise
may
be
appreciated
when
it
is
stated
that
from
the
time
the
three
had
left
houston
they
had
no
idea
that
they
were
being
followed
and
believed
that
they
had
completely
foiled
jesse
and
his
assistants
while
jesse
had
been
chasing
dodge
across
the
desert
his
lawyers
had
not
been
idle
and
had
secured
at
austin
another
extradition
warrant
from
governor
lanham
who
on
receiving
news
of
the
arrest
promptly
instructed
captain
hughes
by
wire
to
assume
charge
of
the
prisoner
and
to
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
the
new
york
officer
to
be
conveyed
to
new
york
there
now
began
such
a
legal
battle
as
the
state
of
texas
had
never
known
hummel
had
been
forced
into
his
last
ditch
and
was
fighting
desperately
for
life
through
kaffenburgh
he
at
once
applied
for
a
new
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
nueces
county
and
engaged
counsel
at
corpus
christie
to
assist
in
fighting
for
the
release
of
the
prisoner
precisely
as
hummel
had
intended
chief
wright
of
nueces
rode
into
alice
and
demanded
the
prisoner
from
captain
hughes
as
hummel
had
intended
captain
hughes
refused
to
surrender
the
prisoner
and
told
chief
wright
to
go
to
well
he
told
him
that
he
intended
to
obey
his
the
governor
of
texas
on
february
hummel
through
kaffenburgh
attempted
to
get
another
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
bee
county
and
promptly
the
bee
chief
came
buzzing
over
and
demanded
dodge
but
to
him
hughes
replied
even
as
he
had
spoken
to
wright
excitement
in
alice
had
now
reached
such
a
pitch
that
judge
burns
of
the
federal
court
in
houston
ordered
united
states
marshal
john
vann
of
alice
to
assume
charge
of
the
prisoner
the
indomitable
hughes
however
paid
no
more
attention
to
the
united
states
marshal
than
he
had
to
the
local
chiefs
but
the
situation
was
so
delicate
and
the
clash
of
authority
might
so
easily
have
resulted
in
bloodshed
that
it
was
finally
agreed
by
all
parties
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
have
the
prisoner
returned
to
houston
in
the
custody
of
captain
hughes
of
the
rangers
and
the
united
states
marshal
jesse
through
his
counsel
in
proper
course
made
application
to
forfeit
dodge
bond
and
remand
him
to
jail
but
the
hummel
attorneys
finally
induced
the
court
on
the
plea
that
to
confine
dodge
in
jail
would
be
detrimental
to
his
already
badly
impaired
health
to
permit
the
prisoner
to
go
free
on
a
greatly
increased
bond
nevertheless
restricting
his
movements
to
harris
county
texas
while
jesse
had
fought
a
winning
battle
up
to
this
point
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
resources
so
far
as
the
extradition
of
the
prisoner
was
concerned
for
dodge
was
now
at
liberty
pending
the
decisions
upon
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
of
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
fort
worth
and
the
united
states
supreme
court
at
washington
but
his
orders
were
to
dodge
back
new
york
hence
with
the
aid
of
some
new
men
sent
him
from
the
north
he
commenced
an
even
closer
surveillance
of
the
prisoner
than
ever
before
by
both
day
and
night
meantime
kaffenburgh
departed
for
new
york
fleeing
from
the
wrath
of
judge
burns
who
had
issued
a
summons
for
him
for
contempt
of
the
federal
court
on
the
ground
that
he
had
induced
dodge
to
attempt
to
jump
his
bond
in
place
of
the
blustering
kaffenburgh
was
sent
another
member
of
the
famous
law
firm
of
howe
and
hummel
david
may
an
entirely
different
type
of
man
may
was
as
mild
as
a
day
in
june
as
urbane
as
kaffenburgh
had
been
insolent
he
fluttered
into
houston
like
a
white
dove
of
peace
with
the
proverbial
olive
branch
in
his
mouth
from
now
on
the
tactics
employed
by
the
representatives
of
hummel
were
conciliatory
in
the
extreme
may
however
did
not
long
remain
in
houston
as
it
was
apparent
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
by
either
side
pending
the
action
of
the
courts
and
in
any
event
dodge
was
abundantly
supplied
with
local
counsel
the
time
had
now
come
when
hummel
must
have
begun
to
feel
that
the
fates
were
against
him
and
that
a
term
in
state
prison
was
a
concrete
possibility
even
for
him
in
the
meantime
dodge
and
bracken
had
taken
up
their
headquarters
at
the
rice
hotel
in
the
most
expensive
suite
of
rooms
in
the
house
a
new
scheme
for
getting
the
prisoner
beyond
the
reach
of
the
new
york
courts
apparently
having
been
concocted
dodge
was
now
indulged
in
every
conceivable
luxury
and
vice
he
was
plunged
into
every
sort
of
excess
there
was
no
debauchery
which
bracken
could
supply
that
was
not
his
and
their
rapid
method
of
existence
was
soon
the
talk
of
the
county
and
continued
to
be
so
for
ten
long
months
there
is
more
than
one
way
to
kill
a
cat
and
more
than
one
method
of
wiping
out
the
only
existing
witness
against
a
desperate
man
striving
to
escape
the
consequences
of
crime
dodge
daily
routine
was
somewhat
as
follows
he
never
slept
at
his
own
hotel
but
arose
in
the
morning
between
ten
and
eleven
when
he
was
at
once
visited
by
bracken
and
supplied
with
numerous
drinks
in
lieu
of
the
breakfast
for
which
he
never
had
any
desire
at
noon
the
two
would
have
luncheon
with
more
drinks
in
the
afternoon
they
would
retire
to
the
pool
rooms
and
play
the
races
and
when
the
races
were
over
they
would
then
visit
the
faro
banks
and
gamble
until
midnight
or
later
later
on
they
would
proceed
to
another
resort
on
louisiana
street
where
dodge
really
lived
here
his
day
may
be
said
to
have
begun
and
here
he
spent
most
of
his
money
frequently
paying
out
as
much
as
fifty
dollars
a
night
for
wine
and
invariably
ending
in
a
beastly
state
of
intoxication
it
is
quite
probable
that
never
in
the
history
of
debauchery
has
any
one
man
ever
been
so
indulged
in
excesses
of
every
sort
for
the
same
period
of
time
as
dodge
was
during
the
summer
and
fall
of
the
fugitive
never
placed
his
foot
on
mother
earth
if
they
were
going
only
a
block
bracken
called
for
a
cab
and
the
two
seemed
to
take
a
special
delight
in
making
jesse
as
jerome
representative
spend
as
much
money
in
cab
hire
as
possible
the
houston
jehus
never
again
experienced
so
profitable
a
time
as
they
did
during
dodge
wet
season
and
the
life
of
dissipation
was
continued
until
from
time
to
time
the
prisoner
became
so
weak
from
its
effects
that
he
was
forced
to
go
under
the
care
of
a
physician
a
few
days
of
abstinence
always
restored
his
vitality
and
he
would
then
start
out
upon
another
round
of
pleasure
during
this
period
jesse
maintained
a
close
and
vigilant
personal
espionage
over
the
prisoner
for
over
ten
months
he
slept
less
than
four
hours
each
day
his
fatigue
being
increased
by
the
constant
apprehension
of
treachery
among
his
own
men
and
the
necessity
of
being
ever
on
the
alert
to
prevent
some
move
on
the
part
of
the
defense
to
spirit
the
prisoner
away
during
the
summer
attempts
were
repeatedly
made
to
evade
the
vigilance
of
jesse
and
his
men
and
several
desperate
dashes
were
frustrated
by
them
including
one
occasion
when
bracken
succeeded
in
rushing
dodge
as
far
as
galveston
where
they
were
forced
to
abandon
their
design
from
time
to
time
bracken
would
disappear
from
houston
for
a
week
or
ten
days
stating
on
his
return
that
he
had
been
to
new
york
after
which
there
was
invariably
some
new
move
to
get
the
prisoner
away
time
and
space
prevent
giving
a
detailed
account
of
all
the
marches
and
that
took
place
in
this
battle
of
wit
against
wit
in
august
bracken
made
one
of
his
periodical
visits
to
new
york
and
when
he
returned
sought
out
jesse
and
said
blocher
you
might
as
well
be
a
good
fellow
and
get
yours
while
you
can
i
mean
that
dodge
is
not
going
back
to
new
york
even
if
it
cost
a
million
dollars
to
prevent
it
a
few
days
later
bracken
sent
a
gambler
named
warner
to
jesse
who
offered
the
latter
hundred
dollars
to
get
lost
long
enough
for
the
prisoner
to
slip
over
to
mexico
acting
upon
the
advice
of
his
attorney
jesse
encouraged
this
attempt
under
the
belief
that
if
he
could
get
the
hummel
forces
in
the
position
of
having
attempted
to
bribe
him
the
prisoner
bail
could
then
be
forfeited
and
dodge
himself
taken
into
custody
hummel
became
wary
however
and
apparently
abandoned
for
the
time
the
idea
of
bribery
later
on
bracken
again
disappeared
on
his
return
a
marked
change
was
noticeable
in
his
demeanor
and
jesse
observed
that
he
was
in
constant
consultation
with
dodge
from
which
the
detective
drew
the
inference
that
some
last
desperate
move
was
to
be
made
towards
the
escape
of
the
prisoner
on
one
occasion
jesse
saw
bracken
showing
dodge
a
map
and
some
drawings
on
paper
which
so
excited
his
suspicions
that
he
followed
the
two
with
unremitting
assiduity
and
within
a
day
or
two
was
rewarded
through
bracken
carelessness
with
an
opportunity
for
going
through
the
latter
coat
pockets
in
the
billiard
room
here
he
found
a
complete
set
of
plans
worked
out
in
every
detail
for
spiriting
the
prisoner
from
san
antonio
into
mexico
during
the
state
fair
these
plans
were
very
elaborate
every
item
having
been
planned
out
from
the
purchase
of
tickets
and
passing
of
baggage
through
the
customs
to
hotel
accommodation
in
the
city
of
mexico
and
tampico
and
steamship
tickets
from
tampico
to
europe
the
plan
had
been
to
secure
permission
from
the
court
for
dodge
to
leave
houston
long
enough
ostensibly
to
attend
the
fair
at
san
antonio
and
to
lose
him
during
the
excitement
and
crowded
condition
of
the
city
at
that
time
it
is
of
course
needless
to
say
that
these
plans
were
abandoned
when
bracken
discovered
that
jesse
had
been
forewarned
almost
immediately
thereafter
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
fort
worth
texas
decided
one
of
the
habeas
corpus
cases
adversely
to
dodge
but
it
still
permitted
him
to
retain
his
liberty
pending
the
final
determination
of
the
questions
involved
by
the
supreme
court
at
washington
the
hummel
forces
were
apparently
losing
hope
however
for
early
in
october
another
attempt
was
made
to
bribe
jesse
bracken
entered
his
room
one
evening
and
informed
him
that
he
could
get
his
own
price
if
he
would
only
be
a
good
fellow
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
exhibit
a
quantity
of
money
which
he
stated
was
thousand
dollars
the
only
result
of
this
offer
was
to
lead
jesse
to
redouble
his
precautions
for
he
argued
that
the
situation
must
indeed
be
acute
when
such
an
offer
could
be
deemed
worth
while
thereafter
it
was
obvious
that
the
revelry
of
dodge
and
his
companions
was
on
the
increase
accordingly
jesse
added
to
his
force
of
assistants
on
december
nathaniel
cohen
another
member
of
the
firm
of
howe
and
hummel
arrived
at
houston
and
the
next
day
the
supreme
court
at
washington
decided
the
appeal
in
the
habeas
corpus
against
the
prisoner
who
was
at
once
ordered
by
judge
burns
into
the
custody
of
united
states
marshal
william
hanson
things
looked
black
indeed
for
dodge
and
blacker
still
for
hummel
how
the
little
attorney
eating
his
midday
lunch
four
thousand
miles
away
at
pontin
restaurant
on
franklin
street
must
have
trembled
in
his
patent
leather
boots
his
last
emissary
cohen
at
once
procured
an
assistant
by
the
name
of
brookman
and
with
him
proceeded
to
wharton
county
texas
where
they
secured
a
new
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
induced
the
local
sheriff
one
rich
to
swear
in
a
of
one
hundred
men
for
the
purpose
of
coming
to
houston
to
take
the
prisoner
by
force
of
arms
out
of
the
hands
of
the
united
states
marshal
this
was
one
of
the
most
daring
and
desperate
attempts
made
in
recent
years
to
frustrate
the
law
jesse
believes
that
the
real
object
of
this
was
to
precipitate
a
fight
between
themselves
and
the
federal
authorities
it
is
not
inconceivable
that
in
such
an
event
dodge
might
either
have
escaped
or
been
killed
the
men
composing
the
were
of
the
most
desperate
character
and
consisted
largely
of
the
feud
factions
of
wharton
county
known
as
the
wood
peckers
and
the
jay
birds
jesse
has
been
informed
on
what
he
regards
as
reliable
authority
that
this
move
cost
the
hummel
forces
fifteen
thousand
dollars
and
that
each
member
of
the
received
one
hundred
dollars
for
his
contemplated
services
in
the
rescue
of
the
prisoner
but
civil
war
even
on
a
small
scale
can
not
be
indulged
in
without
some
inkling
of
the
facts
becoming
known
to
the
authorities
and
prior
to
the
receipt
of
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court
judge
burns
ordered
the
prisoner
removed
to
galveston
for
safe
keeping
thus
the
long
expensive
and
arduous
struggle
came
finally
to
an
end
for
judge
burns
in
due
course
ordered
that
charles
dodge
should
be
conveyed
to
new
york
in
the
personal
custody
of
the
united
states
marshal
and
delivered
by
him
to
the
new
york
authorities
within
the
borders
of
that
state
such
an
order
was
of
course
exceedingly
unusual
if
not
almost
unheard
of
but
it
was
rendered
absolutely
necessary
by
the
powerful
influence
and
resources
as
well
as
the
unscrupulous
character
of
those
interested
in
securing
disappearance
in
order
to
thwart
any
plans
for
releasing
the
prisoner
by
violence
or
otherwise
and
to
prevent
delay
through
the
invoking
of
legal
technicalities
hansen
and
jesse
decided
to
convey
dodge
to
new
york
by
water
and
on
the
of
december
the
marshal
and
his
five
deputies
boarded
a
mallory
line
steamer
at
galveston
and
arrived
in
new
york
with
their
prisoner
on
the
evening
of
december
dodge
reached
new
york
a
physical
wreck
how
he
was
induced
to
tell
the
whole
truth
after
he
had
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
against
him
is
a
story
in
itself
a
complete
reaction
from
his
dissipation
now
occurred
and
for
days
his
life
was
despaired
of
jesse
too
was
as
the
expression
is
all
in
and
the
only
persons
who
were
still
able
to
appreciate
the
delights
of
new
york
were
the
stalwart
marshal
and
his
boys
who
for
some
time
were
objects
of
interest
as
they
strolled
along
broadway
and
drank
deep
and
hearty
in
the
cafés
to
the
assistants
in
the
district
attorney
office
they
were
heroes
and
were
treated
as
such
how
dodge
finally
testified
against
hummel
on
the
witness
stand
has
already
been
told
as
they
say
if
jerome
had
never
done
anything
else
he
would
have
made
good
by
locking
up
abe
hummel
no
one
ever
believed
he
would
do
it
but
jerome
never
would
have
locked
up
hummel
without
jesse
and
as
jesse
says
with
a
laugh
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
taking
a
long
pull
on
his
cigar
i
guess
i
would
not
do
it
again
no
i
not
do
it
again
for
all
the
money
you
could
give
me
the
wonder
is
that
i
came
out
of
it
alive
when
the
reader
comes
to
think
about
it
he
will
probably
agree
with
him
xi
a
case
of
circumstantial
evidence
in
the
town
of
culiano
in
the
province
of
salano
in
italy
there
dwelt
a
widow
by
the
name
of
torsielli
with
her
two
sons
vito
and
antonio
the
boys
loved
their
mother
devotedly
and
were
no
less
fond
of
each
other
the
height
of
their
ambition
being
to
earn
enough
money
to
support
her
in
comfort
without
need
of
working
in
her
old
age
as
it
was
she
arose
before
light
made
the
fire
cooked
their
breakfast
and
labored
in
and
about
the
house
all
day
until
they
returned
from
the
fields
but
she
was
getting
old
and
at
last
became
bedridden
and
infirm
she
could
no
longer
cook
the
meals
and
the
boys
had
to
shift
for
themselves
moreover
instead
of
finding
her
standing
at
the
door
with
a
smile
on
her
wrinkled
face
welcoming
them
to
supper
on
their
return
the
fire
was
always
out
and
their
mother
lay
on
her
couch
no
less
glad
to
see
them
to
be
sure
but
no
longer
able
to
amuse
them
or
minister
to
their
comfort
then
the
taxes
were
increased
and
hard
times
came
by
twos
and
threes
the
men
of
the
village
packed
their
bundles
bade
to
their
friends
and
families
and
left
the
town
some
to
seek
work
in
other
parts
of
italy
but
most
of
them
to
take
the
big
iron
steamships
for
america
where
work
was
easy
and
money
plentiful
sadly
the
boys
watched
their
comrades
depart
they
would
have
liked
to
go
too
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
this
new
land
of
promise
but
they
could
not
leave
their
mother
the
following
year
some
of
the
men
who
had
gone
away
to
america
returned
in
fine
clothes
and
with
full
purses
to
tell
of
the
wonderful
country
beyond
the
seas
where
one
could
always
earn
his
ten
every
day
and
do
as
he
liked
viva
la
liberta
they
cried
pounding
the
tables
in
the
café
come
comrades
we
have
plenty
of
money
drink
to
the
great
country
of
america
vito
and
antonio
listened
with
envy
one
evening
the
elder
brother
asked
antonio
to
come
to
walk
with
him
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
he
said
suddenly
toni
i
think
i
shall
go
to
this
america
we
need
more
money
to
make
our
mother
comfortable
if
we
wait
until
she
is
dead
the
money
will
be
of
no
use
you
can
stay
here
and
when
i
have
made
a
place
for
you
and
her
you
shall
bring
her
on
the
ship
to
the
new
country
vito
was
five
years
older
than
antonio
and
his
word
had
always
been
law
to
the
younger
brother
so
although
he
was
sick
at
heart
at
the
thought
of
being
left
behind
he
said
nothing
against
the
project
but
tried
to
make
it
easy
for
vito
with
their
mother
the
old
woman
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
her
firstborn
leaving
her
and
declared
with
the
tears
running
down
her
face
that
she
should
never
see
him
again
but
at
last
she
yielded
to
their
persuasions
and
gave
vito
her
blessing
it
would
be
only
a
little
while
before
she
and
toni
would
join
him
and
they
would
be
happy
ever
after
then
toni
was
left
alone
with
his
mother
every
day
he
arose
at
the
first
streak
of
dawn
prepared
breakfast
cleaned
the
house
saw
that
his
mother
was
comfortable
and
then
started
off
for
the
fields
a
month
went
by
two
months
three
a
year
but
no
word
came
from
vito
toni
assured
the
poor
old
woman
that
they
would
certainly
hear
from
him
the
next
week
or
the
next
but
cruel
fear
had
taken
possession
of
him
something
had
happened
to
his
brother
the
years
swept
on
their
mother
became
more
and
more
helpless
antonio
was
obliged
to
hire
a
woman
to
care
for
her
as
nurse
for
a
small
sum
but
it
was
just
enough
to
leave
only
a
pittance
for
them
to
live
on
toni
grew
thin
and
haggard
where
could
vito
be
was
he
alive
or
dead
next
to
his
love
for
nicoletta
lupero
it
became
the
great
passion
of
his
life
to
learn
what
had
become
of
vito
he
had
known
nicoletta
from
a
child
and
their
love
had
followed
as
naturally
as
summer
follows
spring
it
had
always
been
toni
and
nicoletta
ever
since
he
could
remember
but
she
was
growing
up
and
from
a
boy
he
had
become
a
man
yet
how
could
he
marry
when
he
could
hardly
earn
enough
to
support
his
mother
and
himself
they
talked
it
over
time
and
time
again
if
vito
would
only
return
or
good
times
come
it
might
be
possible
but
meantime
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
nicoletta
blossomed
into
womanhood
had
she
not
been
betrothed
she
would
have
been
called
an
old
maid
neither
she
nor
toni
took
any
part
in
the
village
merrymakings
why
should
they
he
was
thirty
and
she
they
might
have
married
ten
years
ago
had
not
the
elder
brother
gone
away
toni
secretly
feared
that
the
time
would
never
come
when
they
would
be
man
and
wife
but
he
patiently
labored
on
earning
his
two
or
at
most
two
and
a
half
a
day
then
a
man
returned
from
america
just
for
the
harvest
to
see
his
family
he
said
that
vito
was
alive
he
had
not
seen
him
himself
but
others
had
seen
him
and
he
was
rich
he
told
of
the
plentifulness
of
gold
in
america
where
every
one
was
comfortable
and
could
lay
up
a
fortune
he
himself
had
saved
over
five
thousand
in
four
years
and
owned
a
interest
in
a
fruit
store
he
was
going
to
take
his
family
back
with
him
all
of
them
they
would
be
rich
too
in
a
little
while
a
man
was
a
fool
to
stay
in
italy
why
did
not
toni
come
back
with
him
he
would
get
him
a
place
on
the
railroad
where
one
of
his
friends
was
padrone
toni
discussed
it
all
with
nicoletta
and
she
talked
with
the
man
herself
toni
she
said
at
length
why
do
you
not
go
here
you
are
earning
nothing
there
you
could
save
in
a
month
enough
to
keep
your
mother
in
comfort
for
a
year
you
have
to
pay
the
nurse
and
that
takes
a
great
deal
while
you
are
here
it
would
cause
talk
if
i
came
to
live
in
your
home
to
care
for
your
mother
but
if
you
go
away
i
can
do
so
without
comment
and
it
will
cost
nothing
perhaps
you
will
find
vito
if
not
you
will
soon
make
enough
to
send
for
both
your
mother
and
me
you
are
a
good
girl
he
answered
kissing
her
but
i
could
not
shift
the
responsibility
of
my
mother
to
your
shoulders
still
i
will
talk
to
father
giuseppi
about
it
the
priest
thought
well
of
the
plan
he
was
a
little
excited
over
america
himself
and
agreed
to
break
the
matter
to
the
mother
she
begged
toni
piteously
not
to
go
he
was
her
only
surviving
son
vito
was
dead
let
him
but
wait
a
little
while
and
she
would
not
be
there
to
stand
in
his
way
then
the
priest
added
his
personal
assurance
that
it
would
be
for
the
best
and
the
mother
finally
gave
way
toni
was
obliged
to
tear
himself
away
by
force
from
the
arms
of
the
old
woman
lying
upon
the
bed
and
her
feeble
sobs
echoed
in
his
ears
as
he
trudged
down
the
road
with
the
scarf
nicoletta
had
worked
about
his
neck
and
a
small
bundle
of
his
tools
and
most
precious
possessions
on
his
shoulder
a
couple
of
miles
farther
on
came
another
harrowing
parting
with
his
betrothed
and
from
the
top
of
the
next
rise
beyond
he
could
see
nicoletta
still
standing
at
the
crossroads
gazing
pitifully
after
him
thus
many
an
italian
for
good
or
ill
has
left
the
place
of
his
birth
for
the
mysterious
land
of
the
golden
west
the
voyage
was
for
antonio
an
unalloyed
agony
of
seasickness
and
homesickness
and
when
at
last
the
great
vessel
steamed
slowly
up
the
north
river
her
band
playing
and
the
emigrants
crowding
eagerly
to
her
sides
he
had
hardly
spirit
enough
left
to
raise
his
eyes
to
the
mountains
of
huge
buildings
from
whose
craters
the
white
smoke
rose
slowly
and
blew
away
in
great
clouds
yet
he
felt
some
of
the
awakening
enthusiasm
of
his
comrades
and
when
once
his
feet
touched
earth
again
it
was
not
long
before
he
almost
forgot
his
sufferings
upon
the
ocean
in
his
feverish
anxiety
to
lose
no
time
in
beginning
to
save
the
money
which
should
reunite
him
to
nicoletta
and
his
mother
as
soon
as
the
vessel
had
docked
a
blustering
italian
came
among
the
emigrants
and
tagged
a
few
dozen
of
them
including
antonio
with
large
blue
labels
and
then
led
them
in
a
long
straggling
line
across
the
gangplank
and
marched
them
through
the
muddy
streets
to
the
railroad
train
here
they
huddled
in
a
dirty
car
filled
with
smoke
and
were
whirled
with
frightful
speed
for
hours
through
a
flat
and
smiling
country
the
noise
the
smoke
and
the
unaccustomed
motion
made
antonio
ill
again
and
when
the
train
stopped
at
lambertville
new
jersey
the
padrone
had
difficulty
in
rousing
him
from
the
stupor
into
which
he
had
fallen
the
italians
crowded
together
upon
the
platform
gazing
helplessly
at
one
another
and
at
the
padrone
who
was
cursing
them
for
a
lot
of
stupid
fools
and
bidding
them
get
upon
a
flat
car
that
stood
upon
a
siding
antonio
had
to
be
pushed
upon
it
by
main
force
but
the
journey
this
time
was
short
and
in
half
an
hour
he
found
himself
upon
an
embankment
where
hundreds
of
italians
were
laboring
with
pick
and
shovel
in
the
broiling
sun
here
he
also
was
given
a
pick
and
told
to
go
to
work
toni
soon
became
accustomed
to
his
new
surroundings
every
night
he
and
the
rest
were
carried
to
lambertville
on
flat
cars
and
in
the
mornings
were
brought
back
to
the
embankment
the
work
was
no
harder
than
that
to
which
he
had
been
used
and
he
soon
became
himself
again
moreover
he
found
many
of
his
old
friends
from
culiano
working
there
in
the
evenings
they
walked
through
the
streets
of
the
town
or
sat
under
the
trees
playing
and
his
letters
home
were
quite
enthusiastic
regarding
the
pleasant
character
of
the
life
to
be
sure
he
could
not
write
himself
but
his
old
friend
antonio
strollo
who
had
lived
at
valva
only
a
mile
from
culiano
acted
as
his
amanuensis
he
was
very
fond
of
strollo
who
was
a
dashing
fellow
very
merry
and
quite
the
beau
of
the
colony
in
his
wonderful
red
socks
and
neckties
of
many
colors
strollo
could
read
and
write
and
besides
he
knew
mother
and
nicoletta
and
when
toni
found
himself
unable
to
express
his
thoughts
strollo
helped
him
out
when
the
answers
came
he
read
them
to
toni
and
joined
in
the
latter
pleasure
toni
himself
soon
became
a
favorite
in
lambertville
for
he
was
simple
and
gentle
and
full
of
for
everybody
he
was
very
too
with
his
handsome
roman
profile
snapping
black
eyes
and
black
curly
locks
yet
he
was
sad
always
especially
so
as
since
his
arrival
in
america
he
had
made
no
progress
toward
finding
vito
from
time
to
time
he
met
other
italians
who
had
been
working
elsewhere
who
thought
they
had
seen
him
or
some
one
that
looked
like
him
but
inquiry
always
elicited
the
fact
that
their
desire
to
give
him
encouragement
was
greater
than
the
accuracy
of
their
memories
of
course
antonio
strollo
who
had
become
toni
inseparable
friend
shared
all
his
eagerness
to
find
vito
in
fact
toni
had
no
thought
that
he
did
not
confide
to
his
friend
and
it
was
really
the
latter
who
composed
the
love
letters
to
nicoletta
and
the
affectionate
epistles
to
the
mother
every
month
toni
divided
what
he
earned
into
three
parts
one
of
them
he
deposited
in
the
another
he
invested
in
a
money
order
which
was
sent
by
strollo
to
nicoletta
for
the
mother
and
the
last
he
kept
for
himself
it
was
astounding
how
fast
one
really
could
make
money
if
one
was
industrious
forty
dollars
a
month
sometimes
that
made
nearly
seventy
to
send
to
nicoletta
his
bank
account
grew
steadily
and
he
often
saved
something
out
of
the
money
he
allowed
himself
to
live
upon
antonio
strollo
on
the
other
hand
was
lazy
and
spent
all
his
wages
on
neckties
waistcoats
and
gambling
sometimes
he
would
do
nothing
for
a
whole
month
but
loiter
around
the
streets
smoking
cigars
and
ogling
the
village
girls
these
last
were
afraid
of
him
and
called
him
the
dare
devil
toni
worked
on
the
embankment
for
three
years
sending
his
money
with
a
letter
to
nicoletta
every
month
the
mother
still
lived
and
nicoletta
was
giving
up
her
own
life
to
take
care
of
her
but
the
old
woman
was
very
feeble
and
no
longer
had
any
hope
of
seeing
either
of
her
sons
again
moreover
she
was
now
so
bedridden
that
it
was
useless
to
think
of
trying
to
move
her
even
if
toni
had
plenty
of
money
no
as
soon
as
he
was
satisfied
that
vito
could
not
be
found
and
had
saved
enough
money
he
must
return
how
she
begged
him
to
return
as
strollo
read
him
the
girl
letters
toni
wept
bitter
tears
and
strollo
wept
likewise
in
sympathy
but
no
word
came
of
vito
toni
anxious
about
his
mother
despairing
of
ever
finding
his
brother
pining
for
nicoletta
and
with
three
hundred
dollars
lying
in
the
decided
to
return
to
italy
but
if
only
he
could
find
vito
first
then
antonio
strollo
had
an
idea
why
not
advertise
he
suggested
he
wondered
that
they
had
never
thought
of
it
before
they
would
put
a
notice
in
the
italian
paper
in
new
york
and
see
what
would
come
of
it
toni
agreed
that
the
idea
was
good
so
strollo
wrote
the
notice
offering
a
reward
for
news
of
vito
two
months
passed
once
more
toni
gave
up
hope
and
then
day
a
letter
came
from
the
from
vito
toni
threw
his
arms
about
strollo
and
kissed
him
for
joy
vito
was
found
at
last
the
letter
dated
yonkers
new
york
told
how
vito
had
by
chance
heard
of
toni
notice
and
learned
that
he
was
in
america
he
himself
he
said
had
prospered
and
was
a
padrone
employing
many
workmen
on
the
he
begged
toni
for
news
of
their
mother
he
confessed
himself
an
ungrateful
son
never
to
have
written
but
he
had
married
and
had
had
children
and
he
had
assumed
that
she
was
being
cared
for
by
his
brother
toni
must
forgive
him
and
come
to
him
at
once
o
dio
cried
toni
the
tears
in
his
eyes
forgive
him
of
course
i
will
forgive
him
come
antonio
let
us
write
my
dear
brother
a
letter
without
delay
and
tell
him
that
our
mother
is
still
alive
how
should
i
like
to
see
his
wife
and
babies
so
they
prepared
a
long
letter
which
strollo
took
to
the
himself
and
mailed
toni
went
back
to
work
with
joy
in
his
heart
and
whistled
and
sang
all
day
long
and
of
course
he
wrote
all
about
it
to
nicoletta
he
was
only
waiting
for
his
month
to
be
up
before
starting
then
he
would
go
to
yonkers
make
vito
a
little
visit
and
return
home
to
italy
it
would
be
easy
enough
after
that
for
vito
would
send
them
money
if
necessary
to
live
upon
several
letters
passed
between
the
brothers
and
at
the
end
of
the
month
toni
drew
out
his
money
from
the
bank
received
his
wages
in
full
and
prepared
to
leave
lambertville
meantime
a
letter
had
come
from
nicoletta
telling
of
his
mother
joy
at
learning
that
vito
was
still
alive
as
toni
had
doubts
as
to
his
ability
to
find
his
way
to
yonkers
strollo
kindly
offered
to
accompany
him
toni
had
made
many
friends
during
his
stay
in
lambertville
and
he
promised
to
write
to
them
and
tell
them
about
vito
and
his
family
so
it
was
agreed
that
the
letter
should
be
sent
to
sabbatto
gizzi
in
whose
house
he
had
lived
and
that
gizzi
should
read
it
to
the
others
the
address
was
written
carefully
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
given
to
toni
so
early
in
the
morning
of
august
toni
and
strollo
took
the
train
for
new
york
it
was
a
hot
day
and
once
again
the
motion
and
speed
made
toni
feel
ill
but
the
thought
of
seeing
vito
buoyed
him
up
and
by
the
time
they
had
crossed
the
ferry
and
had
actually
reached
new
york
he
was
very
hungry
in
his
excitement
he
had
forgotten
to
eat
any
breakfast
and
was
now
beginning
to
feel
faint
but
strollo
said
it
was
a
long
way
to
yonkers
and
that
they
must
not
stop
for
many
hours
they
trudged
the
streets
without
getting
anywhere
and
then
strollo
said
it
was
time
to
take
the
cars
toni
was
very
tired
and
he
had
to
climb
many
flights
of
stairs
to
the
train
it
carried
them
a
long
distance
past
miles
of
tenement
houses
and
vacant
lots
and
at
last
into
a
sort
of
country
strollo
said
they
should
get
out
it
was
very
hot
and
toni
was
weak
from
weariness
and
lack
of
food
but
his
heart
was
light
and
he
followed
strollo
steadily
down
the
wilting
road
after
going
about
a
mile
they
crossed
some
fields
near
where
people
were
playing
a
game
at
hitting
little
balls
with
sticks
it
was
astonishing
how
far
they
could
strike
the
balls
entirely
out
of
sight
is
this
yonkers
asked
toni
it
is
near
here
answered
strollo
we
are
going
by
a
short
way
they
entered
some
thick
woods
and
came
out
upon
another
field
toni
was
now
so
faint
that
he
begged
his
friend
to
stop
can
we
not
get
some
food
he
inquired
i
can
hardly
walk
there
is
a
man
in
that
field
said
strollo
go
and
ask
him
so
toni
plodded
over
to
the
man
who
was
digging
mushrooms
and
asked
him
in
broken
english
where
they
could
get
something
to
eat
the
man
told
him
that
it
was
a
long
way
they
would
have
to
take
the
trolley
to
yonkers
there
was
a
restaurant
there
called
the
promised
land
where
one
could
get
italian
dishes
he
seemed
to
take
a
kindly
interest
in
toni
and
in
strollo
who
had
remained
some
distance
behind
and
toni
gave
him
a
cigar
a
cremo
the
last
one
he
had
then
strollo
led
the
way
back
into
the
woods
it
was
almost
sunset
and
the
long
low
beams
slanting
through
the
tree
trunks
made
it
hard
to
see
they
went
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
woods
presently
strollo
who
was
leading
the
way
stopped
and
said
we
are
going
in
the
wrong
direction
we
must
turn
around
and
go
back
toni
turned
as
he
did
so
strollo
drew
a
long
knife
and
plunged
it
again
and
again
through
toni
body
strollo
spent
that
night
under
an
assumed
name
at
the
mills
hotel
in
bleecker
street
he
had
stabbed
himself
accidentally
in
the
knee
and
also
in
the
left
hand
in
the
fury
of
his
attack
and
when
he
arose
in
the
morning
the
sheets
were
covered
with
blood
there
was
also
blood
on
his
shoes
which
had
been
new
but
he
took
his
knife
and
scraped
it
off
he
had
experienced
a
strange
sort
of
terrified
exaltation
the
night
before
and
in
the
early
light
as
he
crept
downstairs
and
out
of
the
hotel
he
could
not
have
told
whether
he
were
more
glad
or
afraid
for
he
had
three
hundred
dollars
in
his
pocket
more
than
he
had
ever
seen
at
any
one
time
before
as
much
as
a
man
could
save
in
two
whole
years
he
would
be
a
king
now
for
a
long
time
he
need
not
work
he
could
eat
drink
and
play
cards
and
read
some
books
he
had
heard
about
as
for
finding
him
out
never
the
police
would
not
even
know
who
torsielli
was
to
say
nothing
of
who
had
killed
him
for
he
had
removed
as
he
thought
everything
in
toni
pockets
there
would
be
a
dead
man
in
the
morgue
that
was
all
he
could
go
back
to
lambertville
and
say
that
he
had
left
toni
with
his
brother
at
yonkers
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
first
though
he
would
buy
some
new
clothes
it
was
very
early
and
the
shops
were
hardly
open
but
he
found
one
place
where
he
could
buy
a
suit
another
some
underclothes
and
a
third
a
pair
of
shoes
the
shoemaker
who
was
a
thrifty
man
asked
strollo
what
was
the
matter
with
the
shoes
he
had
on
so
strollo
craftily
said
they
hurt
his
feet
then
he
ate
a
hearty
breakfast
and
bought
a
better
cigar
than
he
had
ever
smoked
before
there
was
a
bookstore
near
by
and
he
purchased
some
books
alto
amore
and
sua
maestá
e
sua
moneta
the
height
of
love
and
his
majesty
and
his
money
he
would
read
them
on
the
train
he
felt
warm
and
comfortable
now
and
not
afraid
at
all
by
and
by
he
went
back
on
the
train
to
lambertville
and
smoked
and
read
all
the
way
contented
as
the
tiger
is
contented
which
has
tracked
down
and
slain
a
the
same
afternoon
about
sunset
in
a
lonely
part
of
van
cortlandt
park
the
mushroom
digger
stumbled
over
torsielli
body
lying
face
downward
among
the
leaves
he
recognized
it
as
that
of
the
man
who
had
asked
the
way
to
something
to
eat
and
given
him
a
cigar
he
ran
from
the
sight
and
pallid
with
fear
notified
the
nearest
police
officer
then
things
took
the
usual
course
the
body
was
removed
to
the
morgue
an
autopsy
was
performed
and
headquarters
took
charge
of
the
case
as
the
deceased
was
an
italian
detective
sergeant
petrosini
was
called
in
torsielli
pockets
were
empty
save
for
the
band
of
a
cremo
cigar
in
one
waistcoat
pocket
and
a
tiny
slip
of
paper
in
another
on
which
was
penciled
sabbatto
gizzi
box
lambertville
new
jersey
whether
this
last
was
the
name
of
the
deceased
the
murderer
or
some
one
else
no
one
knew
headquarters
said
it
was
a
blind
case
but
petrosini
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
bought
a
ticket
to
lambertville
here
he
found
sabbatto
gizzi
who
expressed
genuine
horror
at
learning
of
toni
death
and
readily
accompanied
petrosini
to
new
york
where
he
identified
the
body
as
indeed
that
of
torsielli
he
told
petrosini
that
toni
had
left
lambertville
in
the
company
of
strollo
on
thursday
august
this
was
saturday
august
and
less
than
hours
after
the
murder
strollo
reading
alto
amore
and
drinking
in
the
saloon
suspected
nothing
new
york
was
seventy
miles
away
too
far
for
any
harm
to
come
but
monday
morning
walking
lazily
down
the
street
near
the
railroad
station
strollo
found
himself
suddenly
confronted
by
a
man
with
a
round
face
thickly
covered
with
pockmarks
strollo
did
not
like
the
way
the
latter
eyes
looked
him
over
there
was
no
time
to
turn
and
fly
and
besides
strollo
had
no
fear
they
might
come
and
ask
him
questions
and
he
might
even
admit
almost
all
all
and
they
could
do
nothing
for
no
one
had
seen
what
he
had
done
to
toni
in
the
wood
so
strollo
returned
petrosini
gaze
unflinchingly
are
you
antonio
strollo
asked
the
detective
coming
close
to
the
murderer
yes
certainly
i
am
antonio
strollo
replied
the
latter
do
you
know
antonio
torsielli
continued
petrosini
to
be
sure
answered
strollo
i
knew
him
well
he
added
almost
insolently
why
did
you
accompany
him
to
new
york
inquired
petrosini
sharply
strollo
paled
he
had
not
known
that
the
police
were
aware
of
the
fact
i
had
errands
in
the
city
i
needed
clothes
said
strollo
he
has
been
murdered
said
petrosini
quietly
will
you
come
to
new
york
to
identify
the
body
strollo
hesitated
why
yes
certainly
i
will
go
to
new
york
then
he
added
thinking
that
his
words
seemed
insufficient
i
am
sorry
if
torsielli
has
been
murdered
for
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
there
was
a
wait
of
several
hours
before
the
train
started
for
new
york
and
strollo
utilized
it
by
giving
petrosini
a
detailed
account
of
his
trip
with
torsielli
he
took
his
time
about
it
and
thought
each
statement
over
very
carefully
before
he
made
it
for
he
was
a
clever
fellow
this
strollo
he
even
went
into
the
family
history
of
torsielli
and
explained
about
the
correspondence
with
the
brother
in
which
he
acted
as
amanuensis
for
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
the
long
run
honesty
up
to
a
certain
point
would
prove
the
best
policy
thus
he
told
the
detective
many
things
which
the
latter
did
not
know
or
even
suspect
strollo
account
of
what
had
happened
was
briefly
as
follows
he
and
toni
had
reached
new
york
about
twelve
and
had
spent
an
hour
or
so
in
the
neighborhood
of
mott
street
looking
at
the
parade
of
san
rocco
then
they
had
started
for
yonkers
and
gone
as
far
as
the
terminal
of
the
second
avenue
el
it
was
about
five
in
the
afternoon
they
had
got
out
and
started
to
walk
as
they
proceeded
they
suddenly
had
seen
a
man
standing
under
a
tree
and
torsielli
had
said
to
strollo
that
man
standing
under
that
tree
looks
like
my
brother
strollo
had
replied
you
know
i
am
not
acquainted
with
your
brother
as
they
reached
the
tree
the
stranger
had
stepped
forward
and
said
to
torsielli
who
are
you
who
me
my
name
is
antonio
torsielli
had
been
the
reply
who
are
you
i
am
vito
torsielli
had
answered
the
stranger
then
the
two
had
rushed
into
each
other
arms
and
what
did
do
inquired
petrosini
as
strollo
naïvely
concluded
this
extraordinary
story
me
answered
strollo
innocently
why
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
so
i
went
back
to
new
york
petrosini
said
nothing
but
bided
his
time
he
had
now
several
important
bits
of
evidence
by
strollo
own
account
he
had
been
with
the
deceased
in
the
general
locality
of
the
murder
shortly
before
it
occurred
he
had
given
no
adequate
explanation
of
why
he
was
in
new
york
at
all
and
he
was
now
fabricating
a
preposterous
falsehood
to
show
that
he
had
left
his
victim
before
the
homicide
was
committed
on
the
train
petrosini
began
to
tie
up
some
of
the
loose
ends
he
noticed
the
wound
on
strollo
hand
and
asked
where
it
had
been
obtained
the
suspect
replied
that
he
had
received
it
at
the
hands
of
a
drunken
man
in
mott
street
he
even
admitted
having
stayed
at
the
mills
hotel
the
same
evening
under
an
assumed
name
and
gave
as
an
excuse
that
his
own
name
was
difficult
for
an
american
to
pronounce
and
write
later
this
information
led
to
the
finding
of
the
bloody
bedclothes
he
denied
however
having
changed
his
clothes
or
purchased
new
ones
and
this
the
detective
was
obliged
to
ferret
out
for
himself
which
he
did
by
visiting
or
causing
to
be
visited
almost
every
italian
shop
upon
the
east
side
thus
the
incident
of
the
shoes
was
brought
to
light
strollo
was
at
once
taken
to
the
morgue
on
reaching
the
city
and
here
for
the
first
time
his
nerve
failed
him
for
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
inspect
the
ghastly
body
of
his
victim
look
cried
petrosini
is
that
the
man
yes
yes
answered
the
murderer
trembling
like
a
leaf
that
is
he
you
are
not
looking
at
him
said
the
detective
why
do
you
look
at
him
look
at
the
body
i
looking
at
him
replied
strollo
averting
his
eyes
that
is
he
my
friend
antonio
torsielli
the
prisoner
was
now
taken
to
police
headquarters
and
searched
here
a
letter
was
found
in
his
hip
pocket
in
his
own
handwriting
purporting
to
be
from
antonio
torsielli
to
his
brother
vito
at
yonkers
but
enclosed
an
envelope
addressed
to
antonio
at
this
envelope
bore
a
red
stamp
and
was
inscribed
antonio
torsielli
box
lambertville
new
jersey
the
letter
as
later
translated
in
court
by
the
interpreter
read
as
follows
lambertville
dear
upon
receipt
of
your
news
i
feel
very
happy
to
feel
you
are
well
and
the
same
i
can
assure
you
from
me
dear
brother
you
can
not
believe
the
joy
i
feel
after
such
a
long
time
to
know
where
you
are
i
have
been
looking
for
you
for
two
years
and
never
had
any
news
from
you
i
could
not
as
you
wrote
to
me
to
come
to
you
because
i
had
no
money
and
then
i
did
know
where
to
go
because
i
have
been
always
in
the
country
know
that
what
little
money
i
have
i
sent
it
to
mother
because
if
i
do
help
her
nobody
will
as
you
never
write
to
her
i
believe
not
to
abandon
her
because
she
is
our
mother
and
we
do
want
her
cursed
so
then
if
you
like
to
see
me
you
come
and
take
me
you
spoke
to
me
about
work
thither
but
i
do
understand
about
that
work
which
you
say
and
then
what
will
i
do
because
here
i
have
work
therefore
if
you
think
i
can
come
and
work
with
you
let
me
know
because
i
have
the
address
but
if
you
want
to
do
better
you
come
and
take
me
i
remind
you
about
our
mother
because
i
do
earn
enough
money
which
she
is
your
mother
also
dear
brother
i
hope
you
did
not
forget
our
mother
dear
brother
let
me
know
the
names
of
your
children
and
i
kiss
them
many
regards
to
your
wife
and
aunt
i
beg
you
to
write
to
me
dear
regards
your
brother
antonio
torsielli
when
you
answer
send
the
answer
to
the
address
below
antonio
strollo
strollo
made
no
attempt
to
explain
the
possession
of
this
letter
which
if
sent
at
all
would
naturally
have
come
into
the
possession
of
the
addressee
and
what
was
vito
address
at
yonkers
inquired
petrosini
yonkers
answered
strollo
is
that
the
street
number
of
a
house
or
a
number
asked
the
detective
neither
said
strollo
just
yonkers
thus
the
infamy
of
this
villain
was
made
manifest
he
had
invented
out
of
his
own
brain
the
existence
of
vito
torsielli
in
yonkers
and
had
himself
written
the
letters
to
antonio
which
purported
to
come
from
him
he
had
used
the
simple
fellow
love
for
his
brother
as
the
means
to
lure
him
to
his
destruction
and
brutally
murdered
him
for
the
sake
of
the
few
dollars
which
his
innocent
victim
had
worked
so
hard
to
earn
to
reunite
him
to
his
mother
and
his
betrothed
the
wounds
in
strollo
hand
and
knee
were
found
to
correspond
in
shape
and
character
with
the
wounds
in
torsielli
body
and
the
mushroom
digger
unhesitatingly
identified
him
as
the
man
in
the
company
of
the
deceased
upon
the
afternoon
of
the
murder
it
almost
seemed
like
the
finger
of
providence
indicating
the
assassin
when
the
last
necessary
piece
of
evidence
in
this
extraordinary
case
was
discovered
petrosini
had
hurried
to
lambertville
immediately
upon
the
discovery
of
the
letter
and
visited
the
a
young
lady
named
miss
olive
phillips
had
been
employed
there
as
a
clerk
for
twelve
years
and
had
lately
had
charge
of
what
are
known
as
the
call
boxes
that
is
to
say
of
boxes
to
which
no
keys
are
issued
but
for
the
contents
of
which
the
lessees
have
to
ask
at
the
delivery
window
these
are
very
inexpensive
and
in
use
generally
by
the
italian
population
of
lambertville
who
are
accustomed
to
rent
them
in
common
one
box
to
three
or
four
families
she
had
noticed
strollo
when
he
had
come
for
his
mail
on
account
of
his
flashy
dress
and
debonair
demeanor
strollo
box
she
said
was
no
petrosini
showed
her
the
envelope
of
the
letter
found
in
strollo
pocket
the
stamp
indicated
that
it
had
been
cancelled
at
on
july
when
she
saw
the
envelope
she
called
petrosini
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
stamp
was
a
red
stamp
and
said
to
his
surprise
that
she
was
able
to
identify
the
letter
on
that
account
as
one
by
on
july
as
there
is
no
local
delivery
in
the
town
she
explained
drop
letters
or
letters
mailed
by
residents
to
other
residents
may
be
franked
for
one
cent
now
in
the
first
place
no
italian
in
lambertville
except
strollo
so
far
as
miss
phillips
could
remember
had
ever
mailed
a
letter
to
another
italian
in
the
same
town
a
frugal
italian
moreover
if
he
had
done
so
would
have
put
on
only
the
required
amount
of
postage
on
the
of
july
strollo
had
come
to
the
and
pushed
this
identical
letter
through
the
window
at
the
same
time
handing
her
two
cents
and
asking
her
to
put
on
a
red
stamp
for
him
she
had
been
surprised
at
this
and
had
at
first
thought
of
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
only
a
stamp
was
necessary
but
she
had
refrained
and
put
on
the
stamp
at
the
same
time
she
had
noticed
that
it
was
addressed
to
antonio
torsielli
lambertville
new
jersey
strollo
had
then
taken
the
letter
and
slipped
it
into
the
drop
and
she
had
cancelled
the
stamp
taking
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
letter
a
second
time
a
stranger
coincidence
could
hardly
be
imagined
and
this
observing
young
lady
from
the
country
was
thus
able
to
supply
the
most
important
link
in
the
chain
against
the
murderer
and
to
demonstrate
conclusively
that
the
wretch
had
himself
been
mailing
in
lambertville
the
letters
purporting
to
come
from
the
fictitious
brother
in
yonkers
strollo
was
now
placed
in
the
house
of
detention
as
a
witness
a
course
frequently
pursued
when
it
is
desirable
to
prevent
a
suspect
from
knowing
that
he
is
accused
the
case
against
him
was
practically
complete
for
it
did
not
seem
humanly
possible
that
any
jury
would
hesitate
to
convict
him
upon
the
evidence
but
juries
are
loath
to
find
any
one
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
upon
purely
circumstantial
evidence
and
this
was
the
first
purely
circumstantial
case
in
a
long
time
inspector
price
therefore
conceived
the
idea
of
trapping
strollo
into
a
confession
by
placing
a
detective
in
confinement
with
him
under
the
guise
of
being
a
it
was
of
course
patent
that
strollo
was
but
a
child
mentally
but
he
was
shrewd
and
sly
and
if
he
denied
his
guilt
there
was
still
a
chance
of
his
escape
accordingly
a
detective
named
repetto
was
assigned
to
the
disagreeable
task
of
taking
the
part
of
an
accused
criminal
he
was
detailed
to
the
house
of
detention
and
remained
there
for
five
days
from
september
to
september
here
repetto
became
acquainted
with
strollo
and
the
other
prisoners
giving
his
name
as
silvio
del
sordo
and
his
address
as
bowery
he
played
cards
with
them
read
the
papers
aloud
and
made
himself
generally
agreeable
during
this
period
he
frequently
saw
the
defendant
write
and
familiarized
himself
with
his
chirography
the
scheme
worked
and
repetto
afterward
received
five
letters
from
strollo
sent
after
the
latter
had
been
removed
from
the
house
of
detention
to
the
tombs
and
indicted
for
the
murder
of
torsielli
the
first
dated
september
was
merely
to
inform
his
supposed
friend
silvio
of
the
change
in
his
residence
and
to
inquire
the
whereabouts
of
another
prisoner
named
philip
the
second
would
be
pathetic
were
it
not
written
by
the
defendant
in
the
case
it
carries
with
it
the
flavor
of
the
calabrian
hills
new
york
sir
silvio
i
write
and
believe
not
to
sicken
you
with
my
words
but
it
is
enough
that
you
are
well
in
health
i
take
the
liberty
again
not
having
any
one
else
but
you
and
i
believe
to
find
a
brother
in
you
not
a
friend
i
ask
you
nothing
only
if
you
have
time
to
come
and
see
me
as
soon
as
possible
i
ask
you
this
as
a
favor
because
i
know
and
believe
to
find
a
true
friend
as
i
want
to
ask
you
a
certain
thing
at
the
cost
of
my
life
i
will
not
say
any
more
bring
me
five
cents
of
paper
and
envelopes
to
write
letters
and
when
you
come
i
will
give
you
the
money
nothing
else
i
am
yours
ever
servant
and
perfect
friend
a
strollo
the
third
letter
from
the
perfect
friend
to
his
equally
perfect
friend
is
an
extraordinary
combination
of
ingenuity
and
ignorance
it
contains
the
only
suggestion
of
a
defence
that
of
an
alibi
new
york
esteemed
friend
with
retard
i
answer
in
receiving
yours
i
was
very
very
glad
i
believe
all
you
told
me
and
i
am
grateful
and
hope
you
will
not
betray
me
because
you
know
it
will
cost
the
life
of
a
poor
unfortunate
so
do
as
you
told
me
keep
things
to
ourselves
if
you
wish
to
help
me
you
will
do
me
a
great
service
and
if
god
helps
me
you
can
dispose
of
my
life
so
i
will
have
you
called
unexpected
saying
that
i
did
not
know
if
you
remembered
so
if
you
are
called
the
first
thing
you
must
do
is
to
make
believe
to
look
at
me
and
then
you
say
you
remember
of
having
seen
me
looking
at
the
pictures
in
front
of
place
where
you
work
and
you
asked
me
if
i
wanted
my
pictures
taken
and
i
said
no
if
they
ask
at
what
time
say
or
and
that
you
spoke
with
me
for
quite
awhile
if
they
ask
how
was
he
dressed
the
coat
was
black
the
shoes
russet
the
trousers
with
white
stripes
which
is
the
one
i
am
now
wearing
what
tie
i
do
remember
i
only
know
he
was
well
dressed
the
hat
was
brown
if
they
ask
did
he
have
a
mark
on
his
hand
say
no
he
had
a
ring
with
a
black
stone
how
many
times
did
you
see
him
say
that
after
your
work
you
were
going
around
mott
street
and
you
saw
me
again
and
how
it
was
eight
or
past
eight
and
you
saw
me
with
a
handkerchief
around
my
hand
and
you
said
to
me
why
i
had
my
hand
so
and
he
answered
that
some
one
struck
him
i
asked
if
it
hurt
much
he
said
he
did
not
feel
it
did
both
of
you
go
to
drink
no
where
else
did
strollo
go
strollo
said
he
was
going
at
the
bleecker
street
hotel
to
sleep
did
you
see
him
again
no
nothing
else
if
you
want
to
help
me
reflect
well
but
you
do
need
any
more
words
from
me
say
just
what
i
have
said
and
i
hope
with
faith
of
a
brother
not
a
friend
i
am
ever
your
friend
strollo
it
may
and
probably
will
appear
to
the
reader
that
a
clearer
case
of
guilt
could
hardly
be
established
but
the
action
of
juries
is
always
problematical
and
this
was
a
case
composed
entirely
of
circumstantial
evidence
the
jury
would
be
obliged
to
find
that
no
reasonable
hypothesis
consistent
with
the
innocence
of
the
accused
could
be
formulated
upon
the
evidence
thus
even
in
the
face
of
the
facts
proven
against
him
some
freak
juryman
might
still
have
said
but
after
all
how
do
you
that
strollo
killed
him
some
fellow
might
have
done
it
even
the
faking
of
a
defence
does
not
prove
the
defendant
guilty
but
merely
that
he
fears
conviction
and
is
ready
to
resort
to
feigned
testimony
to
secure
his
freedom
many
innocent
men
convict
themselves
in
precisely
this
way
accordingly
it
was
by
no
means
with
confidence
that
the
people
went
to
trial
but
throughout
this
remarkable
case
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
have
been
preordained
that
strollo
should
not
escape
punishment
for
his
treacherous
crime
no
defence
was
possible
not
even
the
partially
prepared
alibi
was
attempted
and
the
only
thing
that
savored
of
a
defence
was
the
introduction
of
a
letter
alleged
to
have
been
received
by
the
defendant
while
in
the
house
of
detention
and
which
if
genuine
would
have
apparently
established
that
the
crime
had
been
perpetrated
by
the
black
hand
the
offering
of
this
letter
was
a
curious
and
fatal
blunder
for
it
was
later
proven
by
the
people
to
be
in
strollo
own
handwriting
it
was
his
last
despairing
effort
to
escape
the
consequences
of
his
crime
headed
with
a
cross
drawn
in
blood
it
ran
as
follows
i
swear
upon
this
cross
which
is
the
blood
of
my
veins
strollo
is
innocent
i
swear
upon
the
cross
the
revengeful
black
hand
could
save
me
new

sir
strollo
knowing
you
only
by
name
eight
days
after
that
i
leave
this
letter
will
be
sent
to
you
i
leave
at
seven
with
the

therefore
i
leave
betraying
my
oath
that
i
have
held
for
the
last
three
years
belonging
to
the
black
hand
i
will
leave
three
letters
one
to
you
one
to
the
police
officer
capri
and
the
other
to
the
law
mulberry

all
what
i
am
saying
i
have
sworn
to
before
god
therefore
your
innocence
will
be
given
you
first
by
god
and
then
by
the
law
capturing
the
true
murders
i
am
sure
that
they
already
captured
the
murderer
of
torsielli
who
lured
you
to
come
to
new
york
was
giuseppi
rosa
who
knew
you
for
nearly
two
years
and
who
comes
from
lambertville
came
among
us
and
played
you
a
trick
he
is
a
calabrise
and
has
a
mighty
grudge
he
and
four
others
are
averse
to
them
announce
the
name
of
the
man
who
stabbed
you
with
the
knife
was
antonio
villa
he
had
to
kill
but
was
fortunate
he
is
in
jail
for
the
present
time
and
i
know
for
how
long
but
i
know
that
he
was
arrested
nothing
else
to
say
i
have
done
my
duty
in
giving
you
all
the
information

first

of
the

letter
written
by
strollo
and
put
in
evidence
at
his
trial
placing
the
murder
of
torsielli
upon
members
of
that
imaginary
secret
organization
this
letter
convicted
him
it
is
clear
from
the
letter
that
strollo
had
formed
a
vague
plan
for
his
defence
which
should
in
part
consist
of
the
claim
that
he
as
well
as
torsielli
had
been
marked
for
death
by
the
black
hand
and
that
while
both
had
been
induced
to
come
to
new
york
the
plans
of
the
assassins
had
in
his
case
miscarried
the
reader
has
already
observed
that
purely
for
the
purpose
of
securing
his
continued
interest
in
the
present
narrative
the
writer
has
as
it
were
told
his
story
backward
reserving
as
long
as
possible
the
fact
that
the
finding
of
the
beloved
vito
was
a
pure
fiction
invented
by
the
murderer
at
the
trial
however
the
jury
listened
breathlessly
while
bit
by
bit
the
whole
pathetic
story
was
painted
before
them
like
a
mosaic
picture
they
heard
first
the
story
of
the
mushroom
digger
there
of
the
expedition
of
petrosini
to
lambertville
of
the
identification
of
torsielli
body
of
the
elaborate
fabrications
of
strollo
and
in
due
course
of
the
letter
in
the
murderer
pocket
gradually
the
true
character
of
the
defendant
crime
came
over
them
and
they
turned
from
him
in
aversion
the
natural
climax
in
the
evidence
was
miss
phillip
extraordinary
identification
of
the
defendant
sitting
at
the
bar
as
the
man
who
had
mailed
upon
the
of
july
at
the
lambertville
the
envelope
purporting
to
come
from
yonkers
and
containing
the
forged
letter
from
the
imaginary
vito
strollo
remained
almost
to
the
last
confident
that
he
could
never
be
convicted
but
when
his
own
letters
in
prison
were
introduced
in
evidence
he
turned
ashen
pale
and
stared
fixedly
at
the
judge
the
jury
deliberated
but
fifteen
minutes
their
functions
consisting
of
but
a
single
ballot
followed
by
a
prayer
for
the
wretched
murderer
soul
then
they
filed
slowly
back
and
in
the
waning
light
of
the
summer
afternoon
just
one
year
after
the
murder
and
at
the
precise
hour
at
which
strollo
had
killed
his
victim
pronounced
him
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
in
due
course
his
conviction
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
on

he
paid
the
penalty
for
his
crime
in
the
