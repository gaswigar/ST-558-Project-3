i
seen
that
face
before
said
a
voice
tony
graham
looked
up
from
his
bag
allen
he
said
the
dickens
are
you
up
here
for
was
rather
thinking
of
doing
a
little
boxing
if
you
no
objection
of
course
you
ought
to
be
on
a
bed
of
sickness
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
heard
you
crocked
yourself
i
did
nothing
much
though
trod
on
myself
during
a
game
of
fives
and
twisted
my
ankle
a
bit
for
the
middles
of
course
am
i
so
i
saw
in
the
sportsman
it
says
you
weigh
more
really
i
believe
sha
be
able
to
have
any
lunch
or
i
shall
have
to
go
in
for
the
heavies
what
are
you
eleven
well
let
hope
we
meet
in
the
final
said
tony
it
was
at
aldershot
to
be
more
exact
in
the
of
the
queen
avenue
gymnasium
at
aldershot
that
the
conversation
took
place
from
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
from
dan
even
unto
beersheba
the
representatives
of
the
public
schools
had
assembled
to
box
fence
and
perform
gymnastic
prodigies
for
fame
and
silver
medals
the
room
was
full
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
of
them
looking
ponderous
and
muscular
diminutive
but
wiry
fencers
and
gymnasts
in
scores
some
wearing
the
unmistakable
air
of
the
veteran
for
whom
aldershot
has
no
mysteries
others
nervous
and
wishing
themselves
back
again
at
school
tony
graham
had
chosen
a
corner
near
the
door
this
was
his
first
appearance
at
aldershot
st
austin
was
his
school
and
he
was
by
far
the
best
there
but
his
doubts
as
to
his
ability
to
hold
his
own
against
were
extreme
nor
were
they
lessened
by
the
knowledge
that
his
cousin
allen
thomson
was
to
be
one
of
his
opponents
indeed
if
he
had
not
been
a
man
of
mettle
he
might
well
have
thought
that
with
allen
advent
his
chances
were
at
an
end
allen
was
at
rugby
he
was
the
son
of
a
baronet
who
owned
many
acres
in
wiltshire
and
held
fixed
opinions
on
the
subject
of
the
whole
duty
of
man
who
he
held
should
be
before
anything
else
a
sportsman
both
the
thomsons
allen
brother
jim
was
at
st
austin
in
the
same
house
as
tony
were
good
at
most
forms
of
sport
jim
however
had
never
taken
to
the
art
of
boxing
very
kindly
but
by
way
of
compensation
allen
had
skill
enough
for
two
he
was
a
splendid
boxer
quick
neat
scientific
he
had
been
up
to
aldershot
three
times
once
as
a
and
twice
as
a
and
each
time
he
had
returned
with
the
silver
medal
as
for
tony
he
was
more
a
fighter
than
a
sparrer
when
he
paid
a
visit
to
his
uncle
house
he
boxed
with
allen
daily
and
invariably
got
the
worst
of
it
allen
was
too
quick
for
him
but
he
was
clever
with
his
hands
his
supply
of
pluck
was
inexhaustible
and
physically
he
was
as
hard
as
nails
your
ankle
all
right
again
now
he
asked
well
it
was
much
of
a
sprain
interfered
with
my
training
a
good
bit
though
i
ought
by
rights
to
be
well
under
eleven
stone
you
all
right
i
suppose
bad
boxing
takes
it
out
of
you
more
than
footer
or
a
race
i
was
in
good
footer
training
long
before
i
started
to
get
fit
for
aldershot
but
i
think
i
ought
to
get
along
fairly
well
any
idea
who
in
against
us
felsted
wellington
that
all
i
think
paul
well
i
hope
your
first
man
mops
you
up
i
a
conscientious
objection
to
scrapping
with
you
allen
laughed
be
all
right
he
said
you
were
so
beastly
slow
with
your
guard
why
do
you
wake
up
you
hit
like
blazes
think
i
shall
start
guarding
two
seconds
before
you
lead
by
the
way
do
have
any
false
delicacy
about
spoiling
my
aristocratic
features
on
the
ground
of
relationship
you
know
not
let
auld
acquaintance
be
forgot
i
not
thomson
for
the
present
i
rugby
so
and
i
st
austin
personally
i
going
for
the
you
wo
feel
hurt
this
was
in
the
days
before
the
headmasters
conference
had
abolished
the
blow
and
a
boxer
might
still
pay
attentions
to
the
point
of
his
opponent
jaw
with
an
easy
conscience
probably
shall
if
it
comes
off
said
allen
say
it
occurs
to
me
that
we
shall
be
in
a
couple
of
minutes
and
i
started
to
change
yet
good
i
not
brought
evening
dress
or
somebody
else
footer
clothes
as
usually
happens
on
these
festive
occasions
he
was
just
pulling
on
his
last
boot
when
a
gymnasium
official
appeared
in
the
doorway
all
those
who
are
entering
for
the
boxing
get
ready
for
the
please
he
said
and
a
general
exodus
ensued
the
at
the
public
schools
boxing
competition
is
something
in
the
nature
of
a
religious
ceremony
but
even
religious
ceremonies
come
to
an
end
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
tony
was
weighed
in
the
balance
and
found
correct
he
strolled
off
on
a
tour
of
inspection
after
a
time
he
lighted
upon
the
st
austin
gym
instructor
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
they
had
parted
that
morning
the
one
on
his
way
to
the
the
other
to
the
for
a
modest
quencher
mr
graham
dawkins
what
time
does
this
show
start
do
you
know
when
the
come
on
you
ca
say
for
certain
they
may
keep
back
a
bit
or
they
may
make
a
start
with
first
thing
no
the
are
going
to
start
what
number
did
you
draw
sir
you
be
in
the
first
pair
that
be
after
these
two
gentlemen
two
gentlemen
the
first
of
the
were
by
this
time
in
the
middle
of
a
warmish
opening
round
tony
watched
them
with
interest
and
envy
beastly
nippy
they
are
he
said
i
could
duck
like
that
he
added
the
thing
there
is
you
to
watch
the
other
man
eyes
but
is
always
quicker
at
the
duck
than
what
heavier
men
are
you
get
the
best
boxing
in
the
though
the
feathers
spar
quicker
soon
afterwards
the
contest
finished
amidst
volleys
of
applause
it
had
been
a
spirited
battle
and
an
exceedingly
close
thing
the
umpires
disagreed
after
a
short
consultation
the
referee
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
on
the
whole
cloverdale
of
bedford
had
had
a
shade
the
worse
of
the
exchanges
and
that
in
consequence
robinson
of
st
paul
was
the
victor
this
was
what
he
meant
what
he
said
was
wins
in
a
sharp
voice
as
if
somebody
were
arguing
about
it
the
pair
then
shook
hands
and
retired
bout
shrilled
the
ross
wellington
and
graham
st
austin
tony
and
his
opponent
retired
for
a
moment
to
the
and
then
made
their
way
amidst
applause
on
to
the
raised
stage
on
which
the
ring
was
pitched
mr
ross
proceeded
to
the
farther
corner
of
the
ring
where
he
sat
down
and
was
vigorously
massaged
by
his
two
seconds
tony
took
the
opposite
corner
and
submitted
himself
to
the
same
process
it
is
a
very
cheering
thing
at
any
time
to
have
one
arms
and
legs
kneaded
like
bread
and
it
is
especially
pleasant
if
one
is
at
all
nervous
it
sends
a
glow
through
the
entire
frame
like
something
it
is
both
grateful
and
comforting
tony
seconds
were
curious
specimens
of
humanity
one
was
a
gigantic
soldier
very
gruff
and
taciturn
and
with
decided
leanings
towards
pessimism
the
other
was
also
a
soldier
he
was
in
every
way
his
colleague
opposite
he
was
half
his
size
had
red
hair
and
was
bubbling
over
with
conversation
the
other
could
not
interfere
with
his
hair
or
his
size
but
he
could
with
his
conversation
and
whenever
he
attempted
a
remark
he
was
promptly
silenced
much
to
his
disgust
o
moosle
fred
he
began
as
he
rubbed
tony
left
arm
ai
everything
said
the
other
gloomily
and
there
was
silence
again
you
ready
seconds
away
said
the
referee
the
two
stood
up
to
one
another
the
wellington
representative
was
a
plucky
boxer
but
he
was
not
in
the
same
class
as
tony
after
a
few
exchanges
the
latter
got
to
work
and
after
that
there
was
only
one
man
in
the
ring
in
the
middle
of
the
second
round
the
referee
stopped
the
fight
and
gave
it
to
tony
who
came
away
as
fresh
as
he
had
started
and
a
great
deal
happier
and
more
confident
us
proud
fred
began
the
garrulous
man
but
that
ai
nothing
you
wait
till
he
meets
young
thomson
i
seen
box
three
years
and
never
bin
beat
yet
three
bloomin
years
yus
this
might
have
depressed
anybody
else
but
as
tony
already
knew
all
there
was
to
be
known
about
allen
skill
with
the
gloves
it
had
no
effect
upon
him
a
sanguinary
encounter
was
followed
by
the
first
bout
of
the
feathers
and
the
second
of
the
and
then
it
was
allen
turn
to
fight
the
harrow
representative
it
was
not
a
very
exciting
bout
allen
took
things
very
easily
he
knew
his
training
was
by
no
means
all
it
should
have
been
and
it
was
not
his
game
to
take
it
out
of
himself
with
any
firework
business
in
the
trial
heats
he
would
reserve
that
for
the
final
so
he
sparred
three
gentle
rounds
with
the
harrow
sportsman
just
doing
sufficient
to
keep
the
lead
and
obtain
the
verdict
after
the
last
round
he
finished
without
having
turned
a
hair
he
had
only
received
one
really
hard
blow
and
that
had
done
no
damage
after
this
came
a
long
series
of
fights
the
shed
their
blood
in
gallons
for
name
and
fame
the
gave
excellent
exhibitions
of
science
and
the
pairs
were
fought
off
until
there
remained
only
the
final
to
be
decided
robinson
of
st
paul
against
a
charterhouse
boxer
in
the
there
were
three
competitors
still
in
the
running
allen
tony
and
a
felsted
man
they
drew
lots
and
the
bye
fell
to
tony
who
put
up
an
uninteresting
three
rounds
with
one
of
the
soldiers
neither
fatiguing
himself
very
much
henderson
of
felsted
proved
a
much
tougher
nut
to
crack
than
allen
first
opponent
he
was
a
rushing
boxer
and
in
the
first
round
had
if
anything
the
best
of
it
in
the
last
two
however
allen
gradually
forged
ahead
gaining
many
points
by
his
perfect
style
alone
he
was
declared
the
winner
but
he
felt
much
more
tired
than
he
had
done
after
his
first
fight
by
the
time
he
was
required
again
however
he
had
had
plenty
of
breathing
space
the
final
of
the
had
been
decided
and
robinson
of
st
paul
after
the
custom
of
paulines
had
set
the
crown
upon
his
afternoon
work
by
fighting
the
carthusian
to
a
standstill
in
the
first
round
there
only
remained
now
the
finals
of
the
heavies
and
middles
it
was
decided
to
take
the
latter
first
tony
had
his
former
seconds
and
dawkins
had
come
to
his
corner
to
see
him
through
the
ordeal
thing
he
kept
repeating
to
keep
goin
all
the
time
and
wear
out
he
too
quick
for
you
to
try
any
with
said
tony
thing
continued
the
expert
to
feint
with
your
left
and
with
your
right
this
was
excellent
in
theory
no
doubt
but
tony
felt
that
when
he
came
to
put
it
into
practice
allen
might
have
other
schemes
on
hand
and
bring
them
off
first
you
ready
seconds
out
of
the
ring
time
in
sir
whispered
the
man
as
tony
rose
from
his
place
allen
came
up
looking
pleased
with
matters
in
general
he
gave
tony
a
cousinly
grin
as
they
shook
hands
tony
did
not
respond
he
was
feeling
serious
and
wondering
if
he
could
bring
off
his
before
the
three
rounds
were
over
he
had
his
doubts
the
fight
opened
slowly
both
were
cautious
for
each
knew
the
powers
suddenly
just
as
tony
was
thinking
of
leading
allen
came
in
like
a
flash
a
straight
left
between
the
eyes
a
right
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
a
second
left
on
the
exact
tip
of
the
nose
and
he
was
out
again
leaving
tony
with
a
helpless
feeling
of
impotence
and
disgust
then
followed
more
sparring
tony
could
never
get
in
exactly
the
right
position
for
a
rush
allen
circled
round
him
with
an
occasional
feint
then
he
hit
out
with
the
left
tony
ducked
again
he
hit
and
again
tony
ducked
but
this
time
the
left
stopped
halfway
and
his
right
caught
tony
on
the
cheek
just
as
he
swayed
to
one
side
it
staggered
him
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
in
darted
allen
again
with
another
trio
of
blows
ducked
a
belated
left
counter
got
in
two
stinging
hits
on
the
ribs
and
finished
with
a
left
drive
which
took
tony
clean
off
his
feet
and
deposited
him
on
the
floor
beside
the
ropes
said
the
referee
as
a
burst
of
applause
greeted
this
feat
tony
was
up
again
in
a
moment
he
began
to
feel
savage
he
had
expected
something
like
this
but
that
gave
him
no
consolation
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
really
would
rush
this
time
but
just
as
he
was
coming
in
allen
came
in
instead
it
seemed
to
tony
for
the
next
that
his
cousin
fists
were
never
out
of
his
face
he
looked
on
the
world
through
a
brown
haze
of
occasionally
his
hand
met
something
solid
which
he
took
to
be
allen
but
this
was
seldom
and
whenever
it
happened
it
only
seemed
to
bring
him
back
again
like
a
boomerang
just
at
the
most
exciting
point
was
called
the
pessimist
shook
his
head
gloomily
as
he
sponged
tony
face
must
lead
if
you
want
to
said
the
garrulous
man
too
slow
go
in
at
sir
wiv
both
an
you
be
all
right
wo
fred
said
it
be
was
the
only
reply
fred
would
vouchsafe
tony
was
half
afraid
the
referee
would
give
the
fight
against
him
without
another
round
but
to
his
joy
was
duly
called
he
came
up
to
the
scratch
as
game
as
ever
though
his
head
was
singing
he
meant
to
go
in
for
all
he
was
worth
this
round
and
go
in
he
did
allen
had
managed
in
performing
a
complicated
manoeuvre
to
place
himself
in
a
corner
and
tony
rushed
he
was
sent
out
again
with
a
flush
hit
on
the
face
he
rushed
again
and
again
met
allen
left
then
he
got
past
and
in
the
confined
space
had
it
all
his
own
way
science
did
not
tell
here
strength
was
the
thing
that
scored
hard
smashes
left
and
right
at
face
and
body
and
the
guard
could
look
after
itself
allen
him
twice
but
after
that
he
was
nowhere
tony
went
in
with
both
hands
there
was
a
prolonged
rally
and
it
was
not
until
had
been
called
that
allen
was
able
to
extricate
himself
blows
had
been
mostly
body
blows
and
very
warm
ones
at
that
right
sir
was
the
comment
of
the
second
both
goin
hard
and
you
win
yet
you
proper
then
fred
and
even
the
pessimist
was
obliged
to
admit
that
tony
could
fight
even
if
he
was
not
quick
with
his
guard
allen
took
the
ring
slowly
his
want
of
training
had
begun
to
tell
on
him
and
some
of
tony
blows
had
landed
in
very
tender
spots
he
knew
that
he
could
win
if
his
wind
held
out
but
he
had
misgivings
the
gloves
seemed
to
weigh
down
his
hands
tony
opened
the
ball
with
a
tremendous
rush
allen
stopped
him
neatly
there
was
an
interval
while
the
two
sparred
for
an
opening
then
allen
feinted
and
dashed
in
tony
did
not
hit
him
once
it
was
the
first
round
over
again
left
right
left
right
and
finally
as
had
happened
before
a
tremendously
hot
shot
which
sent
him
under
the
ropes
he
got
up
and
again
allen
darted
in
tony
met
him
with
a
straight
left
a
rapid
exchange
of
blows
and
the
end
came
allen
lashed
out
with
his
left
tony
ducked
sharply
and
brought
his
right
across
with
every
ounce
of
his
weight
behind
it
fairly
on
to
the
point
of
the
jaw
the
right
is
distinctly
one
of
those
things
which
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
allen
collapsed
nine
ten
the
closed
his
watch
wins
said
the
referee
after
that
man
there
thieves
break
in
and
steal
it
was
always
the
custom
for
such
austinians
as
went
up
to
represent
the
school
at
the
annual
competition
to
stop
the
night
in
the
town
it
was
not
therefore
till
just
before
breakfast
on
the
following
day
that
tony
arrived
back
at
his
house
the
boarding
houses
at
st
formed
a
fringe
to
the
school
grounds
the
two
largest
were
the
school
house
and
merevale
tony
was
at
merevale
he
was
walking
up
from
the
station
with
welch
another
member
of
merevale
who
had
been
up
to
aldershot
as
a
fencer
when
at
the
entrance
to
the
school
grounds
he
fell
in
with
robinson
his
fag
robinson
was
supposed
by
many
including
himself
to
be
a
very
warm
man
for
the
junior
quarter
which
was
a
handicap
race
especially
as
an
injudicious
sports
committee
had
given
him
ten
yards
start
on
simpson
whom
he
would
have
backed
himself
to
beat
even
if
the
positions
had
been
reversed
being
a
wise
youth
however
and
knowing
that
the
best
of
runners
may
fail
through
he
had
for
the
last
week
or
so
been
going
in
for
a
steady
course
of
getting
up
in
the
small
hours
and
going
for
spins
round
the
track
on
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
piece
of
bread
master
robinson
was
nothing
if
not
thorough
in
matters
of
this
kind
but
today
things
of
greater
moment
than
the
sports
occupied
his
mind
he
had
news
he
had
great
news
he
was
bursting
with
news
and
he
hailed
the
approach
of
tony
and
welch
with
pleasure
with
any
other
leading
light
of
the
school
he
might
have
felt
less
at
ease
but
with
tony
it
was
different
when
you
have
underdone
a
fellow
eggs
and
overdone
his
toast
and
eaten
the
remainder
for
a
term
or
two
you
begin
to
feel
that
mere
social
distinctions
and
differences
of
age
no
longer
form
a
barrier
besides
he
had
news
which
was
absolutely
fresh
news
to
which
no
one
could
say
pityingly
have
you
only
just
heard
graham
he
said
you
come
back
tony
admitted
that
he
had
good
for
getting
the
middles
a
telegram
had
of
course
preceded
tony
say
graham
do
you
know
what
happened
be
an
awful
row
about
it
someone
been
and
broken
into
the
pav
how
do
you
know
a
pane
taken
clean
out
i
booked
it
in
a
second
as
i
was
going
past
to
the
track
room
fifteen
the
window
facing
away
from
the
houses
rum
said
welch
what
a
burglar
wanted
in
the
first
room
is
even
a
there
generally
robinson
eyes
dilated
with
honest
pride
this
was
good
this
was
better
than
he
had
looked
for
not
only
were
they
unaware
of
the
burglary
but
they
had
not
even
an
idea
as
to
the
recent
event
which
had
made
the
first
room
so
fit
a
for
the
burgling
industry
there
are
few
pleasures
keener
than
the
pleasure
of
telling
somebody
something
he
did
know
before
scott
he
remarked
you
heard
no
of
course
you
went
up
to
aldershot
before
they
did
it
by
jove
what
they
shunted
all
the
sports
prizes
from
the
board
room
to
the
pav
and
shot
into
the
first
room
i
do
suppose
there
one
left
now
i
should
like
to
see
the
old
man
face
when
he
hears
about
it
good
mind
to
go
and
tell
him
now
only
he
have
a
fit
jolly
exciting
though
is
it
said
tony
all
the
absolutely
idiotic
things
to
do
fancy
putting
there
must
have
been
at
least
fifty
pounds
worth
of
silver
and
things
fancy
going
and
leaving
all
that
overnight
in
the
pav
agreed
welch
whose
idea
it
was
here
robinson
said
tony
better
buck
up
and
change
or
you
be
late
for
brekker
come
on
welch
we
go
and
inspect
the
scene
of
battle
robinson
trotted
off
and
welch
and
tony
made
their
way
to
the
pavilion
there
sure
enough
was
the
window
or
rather
the
absence
of
window
a
pane
had
been
neatly
removed
evidently
in
the
orthodox
way
by
means
of
a
diamond
as
well
climb
up
and
see
if
there
anything
to
be
seen
said
welch
right
said
tony
us
a
leg
up
by
jove
stiff
anything
there
a
cloth
sort
of
thing
covering
what
i
suppose
are
the
prizes
i
see
how
the
chap
whoever
he
was
got
in
you
only
got
to
break
the
window
draw
a
couple
of
bolts
and
there
you
are
shall
i
go
in
and
investigate
not
it
rather
the
thing
i
fancy
in
these
sorts
of
cases
to
leave
everything
just
as
it
is
business
said
tony
as
he
rejoined
welch
on
terra
firma
if
they
catch
the
chap
we
better
be
getting
back
to
the
house
now
it
struck
the
quarter
years
ago
when
tony
some
twenty
minutes
later
shook
off
the
admiring
crowd
who
wanted
a
full
description
of
yesterday
proceedings
and
reached
his
study
he
found
there
james
thomson
brother
to
allen
thomson
as
the
playbills
say
jim
was
looking
worried
tony
had
noticed
it
during
breakfast
and
had
wondered
at
the
cause
he
was
soon
enlightened
jim
said
he
up
with
you
this
morning
feeling
chippy
no
i
all
right
i
in
a
beastly
hole
though
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
it
in
then
we
got
plenty
of
time
before
school
about
this
aldershot
business
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
to
lick
allen
like
that
i
thought
he
was
a
cert
so
did
i
the
thing
there
as
dawkins
say
was
i
knocked
him
out
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
always
happening
i
was
in
it
at
all
except
during
the
second
round
when
i
gave
him
beans
rather
in
one
of
the
corners
my
aunt
it
was
warm
while
it
lasted
first
round
i
did
hit
him
once
he
was
better
than
i
thought
he
be
and
i
knew
from
experience
he
was
pretty
good
you
look
a
bit
bashed
feel
it
too
but
what
the
row
with
you
this
i
had
a
couple
of
quid
on
allen
and
the
rotter
goes
and
gets
licked
lord
whom
did
you
bet
with
allen
himself
to
say
allen
was
crock
enough
to
bet
against
himself
he
must
have
known
he
was
miles
better
than
anyone
else
in
he
got
three
medals
there
already
you
see
his
bet
with
me
was
only
a
hedge
he
got
five
to
four
or
something
in
quids
on
with
a
chap
in
his
house
at
rugby
on
himself
he
wanted
a
hedge
because
he
was
sure
about
his
ankle
being
all
right
you
know
he
hurt
it
so
i
gave
him
four
to
one
in
i
thought
he
was
a
cert
with
apologies
to
you
mention
it
so
he
was
a
cert
it
was
only
the
merest
fluke
i
managed
to
out
him
when
i
did
if
he
hung
on
to
the
end
he
have
won
easy
he
been
scoring
points
all
through
know
so
says
just
like
my
luck
ca
see
what
you
want
to
bet
at
all
for
you
bound
to
come
a
mucker
sooner
or
later
ca
you
raise
the
two
quid
broke
except
for
half
a
crown
lend
it
to
you
like
a
shot
if
i
had
it
of
course
but
you
find
me
with
two
quid
to
my
name
at
the
end
of
term
wo
allen
wait
would
if
it
was
only
him
but
this
other
chap
wants
his
oof
badly
for
something
and
he
leaving
and
going
abroad
or
something
at
the
end
of
term
anyhow
i
know
he
keen
on
getting
it
allen
told
me
tony
pondered
for
a
moment
here
he
said
at
last
you
ask
your
pater
he
usually
heaves
his
money
about
pretty
readily
does
he
you
see
he
would
send
me
two
quid
off
the
reel
without
wanting
to
know
all
about
it
and
why
i
could
get
on
to
the
holidays
with
five
bob
and
i
either
have
to
fake
up
a
lot
of
lies
which
not
going
to
do
course
not
else
i
must
tell
him
i
been
betting
he
bets
himself
does
he
just
where
the
whole
business
slips
up
replied
jim
prodding
the
table
with
a
pen
in
a
misanthropic
manner
the
one
thing
he
absolutely
down
on
he
got
done
rather
badly
once
a
few
years
ago
believe
he
betted
on
orme
that
year
he
got
poisoned
anyhow
he
always
sworn
to
lynch
us
if
we
made
fools
of
ourselves
that
way
so
if
i
asked
him
i
not
only
get
beans
myself
besides
not
getting
any
money
out
of
him
but
allen
would
get
scalped
too
which
he
would
see
at
all
it
no
good
doing
that
have
you
any
other
source
of
revenue
there
just
one
chance
if
that
does
come
off
i
done
my
pater
said
he
give
me
a
quid
for
every
race
i
won
at
the
sports
i
got
the
half
yesterday
all
right
when
you
were
up
at
aldershot
man
i
did
hear
about
that
what
time
anything
good
special
and
awfully
good
you
ought
to
pull
off
the
mile
too
i
should
think
with
luck
drake
the
man
i
afraid
of
he
done
it
in
twice
during
training
he
was
second
in
the
half
yesterday
by
about
three
yards
but
you
ca
tell
anything
from
that
he
sprinted
too
late
your
best
for
the
mile
have
done
but
only
once
my
average
so
there
nothing
to
choose
between
us
on
paper
you
got
more
to
make
you
buck
up
than
he
has
there
must
be
something
in
that
by
jove
i
win
if
i
expire
on
the
tape
i
sha
spare
myself
with
that
quid
on
the
horizon
hullo
there
the
bell
we
must
buck
up
going
to
gorge
tonight
but
i
sha
eat
anything
no
risks
for
me
are
more
in
your
line
now
come
on
and
in
the
excitement
of
these
more
personal
matters
tony
entirely
forgot
to
impart
the
news
of
the
pavilion
burglary
to
him
an
unimportant
the
news
however
was
not
long
in
spreading
robinson
took
care
of
that
on
the
way
to
school
he
overtook
his
friend
morrison
a
young
gentleman
who
had
the
unique
distinction
of
being
the
rowdiest
fag
in
ward
house
which
as
any
austinian
could
have
told
you
was
the
rowdiest
house
in
the
school
say
morrison
heard
the
latest
what
broke
into
the
pav
last
night
you
you
ass
a
regular
burglar
after
the
sports
prizes
here
robinson
try
that
on
the
kids
what
i
am
doing
said
robinson
this
delicate
reference
to
morrison
tender
years
had
the
effect
of
creating
a
disturbance
two
school
house
juniors
who
happened
to
be
passing
naturally
forsook
all
their
other
aims
and
objects
and
joined
the
battle
up
asked
one
of
them
dusting
himself
hastily
as
they
stopped
to
take
breath
it
was
always
his
habit
to
take
up
any
business
that
might
attract
his
attention
and
ask
for
explanations
afterwards
kid
began
morrison
yourself
morrison
lunatic
then
robinson
allowed
the
emendation
to
pass
lunatic
got
some
yarn
on
about
the
pav
being
burgled
it
is
tell
you
i
saw
it
myself
it
yourself
probably
do
you
know
anyway
you
seem
so
jolly
certain
about
it
there
a
pane
of
glass
cut
out
of
the
window
in
the
first
room
wonder
you
know
said
dimsdale
one
of
the
two
school
house
fags
judicially
the
kid
was
telling
the
truth
for
once
in
his
life
those
pots
must
be
worth
something
do
you
think
so
scott
scott
admitted
that
there
might
be
something
in
the
idea
and
that
however
foreign
to
his
usual
habits
robinson
might
on
this
occasion
be
confining
himself
more
or
less
to
strict
fact
you
are
then
said
robinson
vengefully
what
a
fat
lot
you
know
what
you
talking
about
morrison
a
fool
said
scott
since
he
got
off
the
bottom
bench
in
form
there
been
no
holding
him
the
same
said
morrison
feeling
that
matters
were
going
against
him
sha
believe
it
till
i
see
it
you
bet
said
robinson
never
bet
replied
morrison
with
scorn
dare
you
know
you
lose
right
then
i
bet
a
penny
i
right
he
drew
a
deep
breath
as
who
should
say
a
lot
of
money
but
it
worth
risking
it
lose
that
penny
old
chap
said
robinson
to
say
he
added
thoughtfully
you
ever
pay
up
got
us
as
witnesses
said
dimsdale
see
that
he
shells
out
scott
remember
you
a
witness
said
scott
at
this
moment
the
clock
struck
nine
and
as
each
of
the
principals
in
this
financial
transaction
and
both
the
witnesses
were
expected
to
be
in
their
places
to
answer
their
names
at
they
were
late
and
as
they
had
all
been
late
the
day
before
and
the
day
before
that
they
were
presented
with
two
hundred
lines
apiece
which
shows
more
than
ever
how
wrong
it
is
to
bet
the
news
continuing
to
circulate
by
the
end
of
morning
school
it
was
generally
known
that
a
gang
of
desperadoes
numbering
at
least
a
hundred
had
taken
the
pavilion
down
brick
by
brick
till
only
the
foundations
were
left
standing
and
had
gone
off
with
every
jot
and
tittle
of
the
unfortunately
placed
sports
prizes
at
the
interval
the
school
had
gone
to
see
what
it
could
see
and
had
stared
at
the
window
with
much
the
same
interest
as
they
were
wont
to
use
in
inspecting
the
first
eleven
pitch
on
the
morning
of
a
match
a
curious
custom
by
the
way
but
one
very
generally
observed
then
the
official
news
of
the
extent
of
the
robbery
was
spread
abroad
it
appeared
that
the
burglar
had
by
no
means
done
the
profession
credit
for
out
of
a
vast
collection
of
prizes
ranging
from
the
vast
and
silver
mile
challenge
cup
to
the
pair
of
with
which
the
twelve
disciple
of
deerfoot
was
to
be
rewarded
he
had
selected
only
three
two
of
these
were
worth
having
being
the
challenge
cup
for
the
quarter
and
the
cup
for
the
hundred
yards
both
silver
but
the
third
was
a
valueless
flask
and
the
general
voice
of
the
school
was
loud
in
condemning
the
business
abilities
of
one
who
could
select
his
swag
in
so
haphazard
a
manner
it
was
felt
to
detract
from
the
merit
of
the
performance
the
knowing
ones
however
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
the
man
must
have
been
frightened
by
something
and
so
was
unable
to
give
the
matter
his
best
attention
and
do
himself
justice
as
a
connoisseur
had
a
burglary
at
my
place
once
began
reade
of
philpott
house
man
rotter
reade
said
barrett
also
of
philpott
been
telling
us
that
burglary
chestnut
of
his
all
the
morning
i
wish
you
chaps
would
encourage
him
what
was
it
first
i
heard
of
it
at
any
rate
dallas
and
vaughan
of
ward
added
themselves
to
the
group
with
it
reade
said
vaughan
only
a
beastly
reminiscence
of
reade
childhood
said
barrett
burglar
got
into
the
and
collared
all
the
coals
did
he
was
in
the
hall
and
my
pater
got
his
revolver
you
hid
under
the
bed
and
potted
at
him
over
the
banisters
last
time
but
three
you
told
the
story
your
pater
fired
through
the
keyhole
of
the
idiot
that
was
afterwards
well
what
does
it
matter
tell
us
something
fresh
my
opinion
said
dallas
ward
did
it
a
man
of
the
vilest
antecedents
he
capable
of
anything
from
burglary
attempted
poisoning
you
should
see
what
we
get
to
eat
in
house
said
vaughan
the
worst
type
of
beak
he
simply
lives
for
the
sake
of
booking
chaps
if
he
books
a
chap
out
of
bounds
it
keeps
him
happy
for
a
week
man
like
that
bound
to
be
a
criminal
of
sorts
in
his
spare
time
it
action
and
reaction
said
vaughan
mr
ward
happening
to
pass
at
this
moment
the
speaker
went
on
to
ask
dallas
audibly
if
life
was
worth
living
and
dallas
replied
that
under
certain
conditions
and
in
some
houses
it
was
not
dallas
and
vaughan
did
not
like
mr
ward
mr
ward
was
not
the
sort
of
man
who
inspires
affection
he
had
an
unpleasant
habit
of
as
it
was
called
that
is
to
say
his
conversation
was
shaped
to
one
single
end
that
of
trying
to
make
the
person
to
whom
he
talked
feel
uncomfortable
many
of
his
jars
had
become
part
of
the
school
history
there
was
a
legend
that
on
one
occasion
he
had
invited
his
prefects
to
supper
and
regaled
them
with
sausages
there
was
still
one
prefect
unhelped
to
him
he
addressed
himself
sausage
jones
you
please
sir
you
wo
then
because
i
going
to
have
half
myself
this
story
may
or
may
not
be
true
suffice
it
to
say
that
mr
ward
was
not
popular
the
discussion
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
ringing
for
second
lesson
the
problem
was
left
unsolved
it
was
evident
that
the
burglar
had
been
interrupted
but
how
or
why
nobody
knew
the
suggestion
that
he
had
heard
master
robinson
training
for
his
and
had
thought
it
was
an
earthquake
found
much
favour
with
the
junior
portion
of
the
assembly
simpson
on
whom
robinson
had
been
given
start
in
the
race
expressed
an
opinion
that
he
robinson
ran
like
a
cow
at
which
robinson
smiled
darkly
and
advised
the
other
to
wait
till
sports
day
and
then
he
see
remarking
that
meanwhile
if
he
gave
him
any
of
his
cheek
he
might
not
be
well
enough
to
run
at
all
sort
of
thing
said
barrett
to
reade
as
they
walked
to
their
makes
me
feel
beastly
once
start
a
row
like
this
and
all
the
beaks
turn
into
regular
detectives
and
go
ferreting
about
all
over
the
place
and
it
ten
to
one
they
knock
up
against
something
one
does
want
them
to
know
about
reade
was
feeling
hurt
he
had
objected
to
the
way
in
which
barrett
had
spoiled
a
story
that
might
easily
have
been
true
and
really
was
true
in
parts
his
dignity
was
offended
he
said
to
observation
in
a
tone
of
reserved
barrett
did
not
notice
an
awful
nuisance
for
one
thing
it
makes
them
so
jolly
strict
about
bounds
wanted
to
go
for
a
bike
ride
this
afternoon
there
nothing
on
at
the
school
do
you
the
good
if
you
ca
break
bounds
a
ride
of
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
no
good
there
a
ripping
place
about
ten
miles
down
the
stapleton
road
big
wood
with
a
ripping
little
hollow
in
the
middle
all
ferns
and
moss
i
was
thinking
of
taking
a
book
out
there
for
the
afternoon
only
there
he
paused
ordinarily
this
would
have
been
the
cue
for
reade
to
say
i
answer
your
name
at
but
reade
said
nothing
barrett
looked
surprised
and
disappointed
say
reade
he
said
you
like
to
answer
my
name
at
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
had
occasion
to
make
the
request
said
reade
barrett
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
did
he
sleep
did
he
dream
or
were
visions
about
he
said
no
answer
you
mean
to
say
you
wo
course
i
wo
why
the
deuce
should
i
do
your
beastly
dirty
work
for
you
barrett
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
curiosity
urged
him
to
ask
for
explanations
dignity
threw
cold
water
on
such
a
scheme
in
the
end
dignity
had
the
best
of
it
very
well
he
said
and
they
went
on
in
silence
in
all
the
three
years
of
their
acquaintance
they
had
never
before
happened
upon
such
a
crisis
the
silence
lasted
until
they
reached
the
then
barrett
determined
in
the
interests
of
the
common
good
he
and
reade
shared
a
study
and
icy
coolness
in
a
small
study
is
unpleasant
to
chain
up
dignity
for
the
moment
and
give
curiosity
a
trial
up
with
you
today
he
asked
he
could
hardly
have
chosen
a
worse
formula
the
question
has
on
most
people
precisely
the
same
effect
as
that
which
the
query
you
know
where
you
lost
it
has
on
one
who
is
engaged
in
looking
for
mislaid
property
said
reade
probably
at
the
same
moment
hundreds
of
other
people
were
making
the
same
reply
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
to
the
same
question
said
barrett
there
was
another
silence
might
as
well
answer
my
name
this
afternoon
said
barrett
tentatively
reade
walked
off
without
replying
and
barrett
went
to
his
place
feeling
that
curiosity
was
a
fraud
and
resolving
to
confine
his
attentions
for
the
future
to
dignity
this
was
number
one
of
the
pavilion
burglary
certain
revelations
during
the
last
hour
of
morning
school
tony
got
a
note
from
jim
said
mr
thompson
the
master
of
the
sixth
sadly
just
as
tony
was
about
to
open
it
sir
tear
that
note
up
graham
sir
tear
that
note
up
graham
come
you
are
keeping
us
waiting
as
the
hero
of
the
novel
says
further
concealment
was
useless
tony
tore
the
note
up
unread
it
did
want
an
answer
he
said
to
jim
after
school
practice
has
made
thompson
a
sort
of
amateur
lynx
it
was
only
to
ask
you
to
be
in
the
study
directly
after
lunch
there
a
most
unholy
row
going
to
occur
shortly
as
far
as
i
can
see
about
this
burglary
business
have
time
to
tell
you
now
see
you
after
lunch
after
lunch
having
closed
the
study
door
jim
embarked
on
the
following
statement
it
appeared
that
on
the
previous
night
he
had
left
a
book
of
notes
which
were
of
absolutely
vital
importance
for
the
examination
which
the
sixth
had
been
doing
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
morning
in
the
identical
room
in
which
the
prizes
had
been
placed
or
rather
he
had
left
it
there
several
days
before
and
had
not
needed
it
till
that
night
at
six
the
pavilion
had
been
locked
up
and
biffen
the
had
taken
the
key
away
with
him
and
it
was
only
after
tea
had
been
consumed
and
the
evening
paper
read
that
jim
thinking
it
about
time
to
begin
work
had
discovered
his
loss
this
was
about
seven
being
a
jim
did
not
attend
preparation
in
the
great
hall
with
the
common
herd
of
the
houses
but
was
with
tony
of
a
study
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
soon
presented
themselves
to
him
it
was
only
possible
to
obtain
the
notes
in
three
ways
firstly
by
going
to
the
rooms
of
the
sixth
form
master
who
lived
out
of
college
secondly
by
borrowing
from
one
of
the
other
sixth
form
members
of
the
house
and
thirdly
by
the
desperate
expedient
of
burgling
the
pavilion
the
objections
to
the
first
course
were
two
in
the
first
place
merevale
was
taking
prep
over
in
the
hall
and
it
was
strictly
forbidden
for
anyone
to
quit
the
house
after
without
leave
and
besides
it
was
long
odds
that
thompson
the
sixth
form
master
would
not
have
the
notes
as
he
had
dictated
them
partly
out
of
his
head
and
partly
from
the
works
of
various
eminent
scholars
the
second
course
was
out
of
the
question
the
only
other
sixth
form
boy
in
the
house
tony
and
welch
being
away
at
aldershot
was
charteris
and
charteris
who
never
worked
much
except
the
night
before
an
exam
but
worked
then
under
forced
draught
was
appalled
at
the
mere
suggestion
of
letting
his
out
of
his
hands
jim
had
sounded
him
on
the
subject
and
had
met
with
the
reply
my
father
and
burn
my
ancestral
home
and
i
will
look
on
and
smile
but
touch
these
notes
and
you
rouse
the
british
lion
after
which
he
had
given
up
the
borrowing
idea
there
remained
the
third
course
and
there
was
an
excitement
and
sporting
interest
about
it
that
took
him
immensely
but
how
was
he
to
get
out
to
start
with
he
opened
his
and
calculated
the
risks
of
a
drop
to
the
ground
no
it
was
too
far
not
worth
risking
a
sprained
ankle
on
the
eve
of
the
mile
then
he
thought
of
the
this
was
on
the
and
if
its
owner
happened
to
be
out
exit
would
be
easy
as
luck
would
have
it
she
was
out
and
in
another
minute
jim
had
crossed
the
rubicon
and
was
standing
on
the
gravel
drive
which
led
to
the
front
gate
a
sharp
sprint
took
him
to
the
pavilion
now
the
difficulty
was
not
how
to
get
out
but
how
to
get
in
theoretically
it
should
have
been
the
easiest
of
tasks
but
in
practice
there
were
plenty
of
obstacles
to
success
he
tried
the
lower
windows
but
they
were
firmly
fixed
there
had
been
a
time
when
one
of
them
would
yield
to
a
hard
kick
and
fly
bodily
out
of
its
frame
but
somebody
had
been
caught
playing
that
game
not
long
before
and
jim
remembered
with
a
pang
that
not
only
had
the
window
been
securely
fastened
up
but
the
culprit
had
had
a
spell
of
extra
tuition
and
other
punishments
which
had
turned
him
for
the
time
into
a
hater
of
his
species
his
own
fate
he
knew
would
be
even
worse
for
a
prefect
is
supposed
to
have
something
better
to
do
in
his
spare
time
than
breaking
into
pavilions
it
would
mean
expulsion
perhaps
or
at
the
least
the
loss
of
his
prefect
cap
and
jim
did
not
want
to
lose
that
still
the
thing
had
to
be
done
if
he
meant
to
score
any
marks
at
all
in
the
forthcoming
exam
he
wavered
a
while
between
a
choice
of
methods
and
finally
fixed
on
the
crudest
of
all
no
one
was
likely
to
be
within
earshot
thought
he
so
he
picked
up
the
largest
stone
he
could
find
took
as
careful
aim
as
the
dim
light
would
allow
and
hove
it
there
was
a
sickening
crash
loud
enough
he
thought
to
bring
the
whole
school
down
on
him
followed
by
a
prolonged
rattle
as
the
broken
pieces
of
glass
fell
to
the
ground
he
held
his
breath
and
listened
for
a
moment
all
was
still
uncannily
still
he
could
hear
the
tops
of
the
trees
groaning
in
the
slight
breeze
that
had
sprung
up
and
far
away
the
distant
roar
of
a
train
then
a
queer
thing
happened
he
heard
a
quiet
thud
as
if
somebody
had
jumped
from
a
height
on
to
grass
and
then
quick
footsteps
he
waited
breathless
and
rigid
expecting
every
moment
to
see
a
form
loom
up
beside
him
in
the
darkness
it
was
useless
to
run
his
only
chance
was
to
stay
perfectly
quiet
then
it
dawned
upon
him
that
the
man
was
running
away
from
him
not
towards
him
his
first
impulse
was
to
give
chase
but
prudence
restrained
him
catching
burglars
is
an
exhilarating
sport
but
it
is
best
to
indulge
in
it
when
one
is
not
on
a
burgling
expedition
oneself
besides
he
had
come
out
to
get
his
book
and
business
is
business
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
now
for
someone
might
have
heard
one
or
both
of
the
noises
and
given
the
alarm
once
the
window
was
broken
the
rest
was
fairly
easy
the
only
danger
being
the
pieces
of
glass
he
took
off
his
coat
and
flung
it
on
to
the
sill
of
the
upper
window
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
up
himself
without
injury
he
found
it
a
trifle
hard
to
keep
his
balance
as
there
was
nothing
to
hold
on
to
but
he
managed
it
long
enough
to
enable
him
to
thrust
an
arm
through
the
gap
and
turn
the
handle
after
this
there
was
a
bolt
to
draw
which
he
managed
without
difficulty
the
window
swung
open
jim
jumped
in
and
groped
his
way
round
the
room
till
he
found
his
book
the
other
window
of
the
room
was
wide
open
he
shut
it
for
no
definite
reason
and
noticed
that
a
pane
had
been
cut
out
entire
the
professional
cracksman
had
done
his
work
more
neatly
than
the
amateur
chap
thought
jim
with
a
chuckle
as
he
effected
a
retreat
must
have
given
him
a
bit
of
a
start
with
my
after
bolting
the
window
behind
him
he
climbed
down
as
he
reached
earth
again
the
clock
struck
a
quarter
to
nine
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
prep
would
be
over
and
the
house
door
unlocked
and
he
would
be
able
to
get
in
again
nor
would
the
fact
of
his
being
out
excite
remark
for
it
was
the
custom
of
the
to
take
the
air
for
the
few
minutes
which
elapsed
between
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
final
for
the
night
the
rest
of
his
adventures
ran
too
smoothly
to
require
a
detailed
description
everything
succeeded
excellently
the
only
reminiscences
of
his
escapade
were
a
few
cuts
in
his
coat
which
went
unnoticed
and
the
precious
book
of
notes
to
which
he
applied
himself
with
such
vigour
in
the
watches
of
the
night
with
a
surreptitious
candle
and
a
hamper
of
apples
as
aids
to
study
that
though
tired
next
day
he
managed
to
do
quite
well
enough
in
the
exam
to
pass
muster
and
as
he
had
never
had
the
least
prospect
of
coming
out
top
or
even
in
the
first
five
this
satisfied
him
completely
tony
listened
with
breathless
interest
to
jim
recital
of
his
adventures
and
at
the
conclusion
laughed
a
mad
thing
to
go
and
do
he
said
sporting
though
jim
did
not
join
in
his
laughter
but
do
you
see
he
said
ruefully
a
mess
i
in
if
they
find
out
that
i
was
in
the
pav
at
the
time
when
the
cups
were
bagged
how
on
earth
am
i
to
prove
i
did
take
them
myself
jove
i
never
thought
of
that
but
hang
it
all
they
never
dream
of
accusing
a
coll
chap
of
stealing
sports
prizes
this
is
a
reformatory
for
juvenile
hooligans
perhaps
not
course
not
even
if
they
did
the
old
man
would
be
frightfully
sick
if
he
got
to
know
about
it
i
lose
my
prefect
cap
for
a
cert
might
certainly
should
there
would
be
any
question
about
it
why
do
you
remember
that
business
last
summer
about
cairns
he
used
to
stay
out
after
that
was
absolutely
all
he
did
well
the
old
dropped
on
him
like
a
hundredweight
of
bricks
multiply
that
by
about
ten
and
you
get
what
he
do
to
me
if
he
books
me
over
this
job
tony
looked
thoughtful
the
case
of
cairns
the
powers
that
were
was
too
recent
to
have
escaped
his
memory
even
now
cairns
was
to
be
seen
on
the
grounds
with
a
common
school
house
cap
at
the
back
of
his
head
in
place
of
the
prefect
cap
which
had
once
adorned
it
he
said
lose
your
cap
all
right
i
afraid
and
the
sickening
part
of
the
business
is
that
this
real
burglary
make
them
hunt
about
all
over
the
shop
for
clues
and
things
and
the
odds
are
they
find
me
out
even
if
they
do
book
the
real
man
should
wonder
if
they
had
a
detective
down
for
a
big
thing
of
this
sort
are
having
one
i
heard
you
are
then
said
jim
dejectedly
done
you
see
do
know
i
do
believe
detectives
are
much
class
he
probably
have
gumption
enough
to
spot
me
jim
respect
for
the
abilities
of
our
national
was
greater
than
tony
and
a
good
deal
greater
than
that
of
most
people
concerning
the
mutual
friend
wonder
where
the
dear
mutual
gets
to
these
afternoons
said
dallas
who
asked
macarthur
macarthur
commonly
known
as
the
babe
was
a
day
boy
dallas
and
vaughan
had
invited
him
to
tea
in
their
study
you
know
the
mutual
friend
vaughan
and
mine
shares
this
study
with
us
i
call
him
dear
partly
because
he
head
of
the
house
and
therefore
of
course
we
respect
and
admire
him
partly
put
in
vaughan
beaming
at
the
babe
over
a
full
of
sausages
because
we
love
him
so
oh
he
a
beauty
but
rotting
apart
said
the
babe
sort
of
a
chap
is
he
i
hardly
know
him
by
sight
even
describe
him
roughly
said
dallas
a
hopeless
forsaken
unspeakable
worm
it
considerably
remarked
vaughan
manners
are
patronizing
and
his
customs
beastly
wears
spectacles
and
reads
herodotus
in
the
original
greek
for
pleasure
sneers
at
footer
and
jeers
at
cricket
croquet
is
his
form
i
should
say
should
doubt
though
if
he
even
plays
that
why
on
earth
said
the
babe
you
have
him
in
your
study
vaughan
looked
wildly
and
speechlessly
at
dallas
who
looked
helplessly
back
at
vaughan
babe
please
said
dallas
no
idea
how
a
remark
of
that
sort
infuriates
us
you
surely
do
suppose
we
have
the
man
in
the
study
if
we
could
help
it
another
instance
of
ward
at
his
worst
said
vaughan
you
never
heard
the
story
of
the
mutual
friend
arrival
was
like
this
at
the
beginning
of
this
term
i
came
back
expecting
to
be
head
of
this
show
you
see
richards
left
at
christmas
and
i
was
next
man
in
dallas
and
i
had
made
all
sorts
of
arrangements
for
having
a
good
time
well
i
got
back
on
the
last
evening
of
the
holidays
when
i
got
into
this
study
there
was
the
man
plunkett
sitting
in
the
best
chair
reading
reading
herodotus
in
the
original
greek
snorted
dallas
did
take
the
slightest
notice
of
me
i
stood
in
the
doorway
like
patience
on
a
monument
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
i
coughed
he
took
absolutely
no
notice
i
coughed
again
loud
enough
to
crack
the
windows
then
i
got
tired
of
it
and
said
hullo
he
did
look
up
at
that
hullo
he
said
you
got
rather
a
nasty
cough
i
said
yes
and
waited
for
him
to
throw
himself
on
my
bosom
and
explain
everything
you
know
he
asked
the
babe
deeply
interested
a
bit
said
dallas
sorry
vaughan
fire
ahead
went
on
reading
after
a
bit
i
said
i
hoped
he
was
fairly
comfortable
he
said
he
was
conversation
languished
again
i
made
another
shot
looking
for
anybody
i
said
no
he
said
are
you
no
then
why
the
dickens
should
i
be
he
said
i
did
quite
follow
his
argument
in
fact
i
do
even
now
look
here
i
said
tell
me
one
thing
have
you
or
have
you
not
bought
this
place
if
you
have
all
right
if
you
have
i
going
to
sling
you
out
and
jolly
soon
too
he
looked
at
me
in
his
superior
sort
of
way
and
observed
without
blenching
that
he
was
head
of
the
house
another
of
ward
jars
said
dallas
that
vaughan
was
keen
on
being
head
of
the
house
he
actually
went
to
the
old
man
and
persuaded
him
that
it
would
be
better
to
bring
in
some
day
boy
who
was
a
than
let
vaughan
boss
the
show
what
do
you
think
of
that
low
said
the
babe
i
was
thoughtless
and
headstrong
cut
in
vaughan
spearing
a
sausage
as
if
it
were
mr
ward
body
up
dallas
old
man
when
the
sausages
are
done
to
a
turn
thoughtless
and
headstrong
those
were
his
very
words
you
imagine
the
old
beast
said
dallas
pathetically
you
see
him
getting
round
the
old
man
a
capital
lad
at
heart
i
am
sure
distinctly
a
capital
lad
but
thoughtless
and
headstrong
far
too
thoughtless
for
a
position
so
important
as
that
of
head
of
my
house
the
abandoned
old
wreck
tea
put
an
end
for
the
moment
to
conversation
but
when
the
last
sausage
had
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
vaughan
returned
to
the
sore
subject
like
a
moth
to
a
candle
is
only
the
not
being
head
of
the
house
that
i
bar
it
the
man
himself
you
say
you
have
studied
plunkett
much
when
you
get
to
know
him
better
you
appreciate
his
finer
qualities
more
there
are
so
few
of
them
only
fine
quality
i
ever
seen
in
him
said
dallas
his
habit
of
slinking
off
in
the
afternoons
when
he
ought
to
be
playing
games
and
not
coming
back
till
brings
us
back
to
where
we
started
put
in
the
babe
were
wondering
what
he
did
with
himself
it
ca
be
anything
good
so
we
put
beetles
and
butterflies
out
of
the
question
right
away
he
might
go
and
poach
there
heaps
of
opportunity
round
here
for
a
chap
who
wants
to
try
his
hand
at
that
i
remember
when
i
was
a
kid
morton
smith
who
used
to
be
in
this
house
remember
him
took
me
to
old
place
that
frantic
blood
who
owns
all
that
land
along
the
badgwick
road
the
man
sir
alfred
venner
of
badgwick
hall
the
man
generally
very
much
of
badgwick
hall
came
down
last
summer
on
prize
day
one
would
have
thought
from
the
side
on
him
that
he
was
all
sorts
of
dooks
anyhow
took
me
rabbiting
there
i
did
know
it
was
against
the
rules
or
anything
had
a
grand
time
a
few
days
afterwards
milord
sir
venner
copped
him
on
the
hop
and
he
got
sacked
there
was
an
awful
row
i
thought
my
hair
would
have
turned
white
should
think
the
mutual
poaches
said
vaughan
has
got
the
enterprise
to
poach
an
egg
even
no
it
ca
be
that
he
bikes
said
the
babe
he
not
got
a
bike
he
the
sort
of
chap
though
to
borrow
somebody
else
without
asking
possibly
he
does
bike
he
does
said
dallas
only
so
as
to
get
well
away
from
the
before
starting
on
his
career
of
crime
i
swear
he
does
break
rules
like
an
ordinary
human
being
when
he
thinks
it
safe
those
aggressively
pious
fellows
generally
do
did
know
he
was
that
sort
said
the
babe
you
find
it
rather
a
jar
a
bit
he
jaws
us
sometimes
till
we
turn
and
rend
him
he
an
awful
man
said
vaughan
stop
said
the
babe
encouragingly
after
the
silence
had
lasted
some
time
a
treat
picking
a
fellow
to
pieces
like
this
do
know
if
that
your
beastly
sarcasm
babe
said
vaughan
speaking
for
self
and
partner
i
do
know
how
we
should
get
on
if
we
did
blow
off
steam
occasionally
in
this
style
should
probably
last
out
for
a
week
and
then
there
would
be
a
sharp
shriek
a
hollow
groan
and
all
that
would
be
left
of
the
mutual
friend
would
be
a
slight
discolouration
on
the
study
carpet
with
an
aroma
of
fresh
gore
that
why
he
goes
off
in
the
afternoons
suggested
the
babe
want
to
run
any
risks
wonder
such
a
rotten
head
of
the
house
too
said
vaughan
may
gas
about
my
being
headstrong
and
thoughtless
but
i
dashed
if
i
would
make
a
bally
exhibition
of
myself
like
the
mutual
he
do
enquired
the
babe
not
so
much
what
he
does
it
what
he
does
do
that
sickens
me
said
dallas
may
be
a
bit
of
a
crock
in
some
ways
for
further
details
apply
to
ward
but
i
can
stop
a
couple
of
fags
ragging
if
i
try
plunkett
for
nuts
he
simply
helpless
when
there
anything
going
on
that
he
ought
to
stop
why
the
other
day
there
was
a
row
in
the
fags
room
that
you
could
almost
have
heard
at
your
place
babe
we
were
up
here
working
the
mutual
was
jawing
as
usual
on
the
subject
of
cramming
tips
for
the
aeschylus
exam
said
it
was
scholarship
or
some
rot
what
business
is
it
of
his
how
a
chap
works
i
should
like
to
know
just
as
he
had
got
under
way
the
fags
began
kicking
up
more
row
than
ever
said
cut
in
vaughan
instead
of
minding
other
business
he
better
mind
his
own
for
a
change
and
go
down
and
stop
the
row
looked
a
bit
green
at
that
said
dallas
the
row
interfere
with
him
does
with
us
i
said
it
all
very
well
for
you
you
are
doing
a
stroke
of
work
no
amount
of
row
matters
to
a
chap
who
only
delivering
a
rotten
sermon
on
scholarship
vaughan
and
i
happen
to
be
trying
to
do
some
work
all
right
he
said
if
you
want
the
row
stopped
why
do
you
go
and
stop
it
what
it
got
to
do
with
me
interpolated
the
babe
he
well
of
course
we
could
stand
that
crushed
him
said
vaughan
said
in
my
young
days
the
head
of
the
house
used
to
keep
order
for
himself
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
he
was
here
for
because
he
ornamental
so
he
went
down
after
that
said
the
babe
being
a
miserable
day
boy
he
had
had
no
experience
of
the
inner
life
of
a
boarding
house
which
is
the
real
life
of
a
public
school
his
experience
of
life
at
st
austin
was
limited
to
doing
his
work
and
playing
for
the
fifteen
which
it
may
be
remarked
in
passing
he
did
extremely
well
dallas
took
up
the
narrative
after
he
been
gone
about
five
minutes
and
the
row
seemed
to
be
getting
worse
than
ever
we
thought
we
better
go
down
and
investigate
so
we
did
when
we
got
to
the
fags
room
said
vaughan
pointing
the
at
the
babe
by
way
of
emphasis
was
the
mutual
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
gassing
away
with
an
expression
on
his
face
a
cross
between
a
village
idiot
and
an
unintelligent
fried
egg
and
all
round
him
was
a
seething
mass
of
fags
half
of
them
playing
soccer
with
a
and
the
other
half
cheering
wildly
whenever
the
mutual
opened
his
mouth
did
you
do
made
an
aggressive
movement
in
force
collared
the
hat
brained
every
fag
within
reach
and
swore
we
report
them
to
the
beak
and
so
on
they
quieted
down
in
about
three
and
a
quarter
seconds
by
stopwatch
and
we
retired
taking
the
hat
as
a
prize
of
war
and
followed
by
the
mutual
friend
looked
worried
rather
said
vaughan
thank
goodness
he
let
us
alone
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
only
a
sample
though
explained
dallas
sort
of
thing
has
been
going
on
the
whole
term
if
the
head
of
a
house
is
an
abject
lunatic
there
bound
to
be
ructions
fags
simply
live
for
the
sake
of
kicking
up
rows
it
meat
and
drink
to
them
wish
the
mutual
would
leave
said
vaughan
that
sort
of
chap
always
lingers
on
until
he
dies
or
gets
sacked
not
the
sort
of
fellow
to
get
sacked
i
should
say
said
the
babe
not
i
wish
i
could
shunt
into
some
other
house
between
ward
and
the
mutual
life
here
is
worth
living
merevale
now
said
vaughan
wish
i
was
in
there
in
the
first
place
you
got
merevale
he
gets
as
near
perfection
as
a
beak
ever
does
coaches
the
house
footer
and
cricket
and
takes
an
intelligent
interest
in
things
generally
then
there
are
some
decent
fellows
in
merevale
charteris
welch
graham
thomson
heaps
of
them
you
came
to
ward
said
the
babe
did
you
pater
knew
ward
a
bit
if
he
known
him
well
he
have
sent
me
somewhere
else
pater
knew
vaughan
pater
well
who
knew
ward
slightly
and
there
you
are
comme
des
accidents
ward
wanted
to
lug
in
a
day
boy
to
be
head
of
the
house
said
vaughan
harping
once
more
on
the
old
string
might
at
least
have
got
somebody
decent
the
great
babe
himself
babe
why
do
you
come
in
next
term
much
said
the
babe
with
a
shudder
even
barring
present
company
there
are
lots
of
chaps
who
would
have
jumped
at
the
chance
of
being
head
of
a
house
but
nothing
would
satisfy
ward
but
lugging
the
mutual
from
the
bosom
of
his
beastly
family
have
decided
that
point
about
where
he
goes
to
said
the
babe
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
study
opened
and
the
gentleman
in
question
appeared
in
person
he
stood
in
the
doorway
for
a
few
seconds
gasping
and
throwing
his
arms
about
as
if
he
found
a
difficulty
in
making
his
way
in
wish
you
two
would
make
such
an
awful
froust
in
the
study
afternoon
he
observed
pleasantly
you
been
having
a
little
how
nice
been
brewing
if
that
what
you
mean
said
vaughan
shortly
said
plunkett
hope
you
enjoyed
yourselves
it
nearly
macarthur
plunkett
delicate
way
of
telling
you
you
not
wanted
babe
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
going
said
the
babe
long
and
he
went
feeling
grateful
to
providence
for
not
having
made
his
father
like
the
fathers
of
vaughan
and
dallas
a
casual
acquaintance
of
mr
ward
the
mutual
friend
really
was
a
trial
to
vaughan
and
dallas
only
those
whose
fate
it
is
or
has
been
to
share
a
study
with
an
uncongenial
companion
can
appreciate
their
feelings
to
the
full
three
in
a
study
is
always
something
of
a
tight
fit
and
when
the
three
are
in
a
state
of
perpetual
warfare
or
at
the
best
of
armed
truce
things
become
very
bad
indeed
you
find
it
necessary
to
have
every
evening
enquired
plunkett
after
he
had
collected
his
books
for
the
night
work
smell
of
burnt
meat
sausages
said
vaughan
healthy
smell
do
you
good
quite
disgusting
really
the
air
in
here
is
hardly
fit
to
breathe
find
an
excellent
brand
of
air
down
in
the
senior
study
said
dallas
pointedly
stay
and
poison
yourself
here
on
account
he
added
of
your
family
shall
work
where
i
choose
said
the
mutual
friend
with
dignity
course
so
long
as
you
do
work
you
must
talk
vaughan
and
i
have
got
some
livy
to
do
plunkett
snorted
and
the
passage
of
arms
ended
as
it
usually
did
in
his
retiring
with
his
books
to
the
senior
study
leaving
dallas
and
vaughan
to
discuss
his
character
once
more
in
case
there
might
be
any
points
of
it
left
upon
which
they
had
not
touched
in
previous
conversations
robbery
of
the
pots
is
a
rum
thing
said
vaughan
thoughtfully
when
the
last
shreds
of
plunkett
character
had
been
put
through
the
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
it
the
sort
of
thing
one
does
think
possible
till
it
actually
happens
the
dickens
made
them
put
the
things
in
the
pav
at
all
they
must
have
known
it
would
be
safe
you
see
they
usually
cart
them
into
the
board
room
i
believe
only
this
time
the
governors
were
going
to
have
a
meeting
there
they
could
very
well
meet
in
a
room
with
the
table
all
covered
with
silver
pots
see
why
i
suppose
they
could
really
but
some
of
the
governors
are
fairly
nuts
on
strict
form
there
that
crock
who
makes
the
vote
of
thanks
speeches
on
prize
day
you
can
see
him
rising
to
a
point
of
order
and
fixing
the
old
with
a
fishy
eye
anyhow
i
do
see
that
they
can
blame
a
burglar
for
taking
the
pots
if
they
simply
chuck
them
in
his
way
like
that
i
say
we
better
weigh
in
with
the
livy
the
man
ward
be
round
directly
where
the
dic
our
invaluable
friend
mr
bohn
right
now
you
reel
it
off
and
i
keep
an
eye
on
the
notes
and
they
settled
down
to
the
business
of
the
day
after
a
while
vaughan
looked
up
going
to
win
the
mile
he
asked
the
matter
with
thomson
about
drake
then
won
the
half
knew
you
say
that
the
half
is
a
test
of
a
chap
mile
form
besides
did
you
happen
to
see
drake
sprint
good
one
know
but
look
how
late
he
started
for
it
thomson
crammed
on
the
pace
directly
he
got
into
the
straight
drake
only
began
to
put
it
on
when
he
got
to
the
pav
even
then
he
was
far
behind
at
the
tape
well
i
not
plunging
either
way
ought
to
be
a
good
race
i
say
i
wonder
welch
does
try
his
hand
at
the
mile
i
believe
he
would
do
some
rattling
times
if
he
only
try
welch
is
a
sprinter
know
but
i
believe
for
all
that
that
the
mile
his
distance
always
well
up
in
the
runs
he
not
in
for
it
this
year
thomson
my
man
it
be
a
near
thing
though
near
thing
with
drake
in
front
right
we
see
wonder
why
the
beak
does
come
up
i
ca
sit
here
doing
livy
all
the
evening
and
yet
if
we
stop
he
bound
to
look
in
lord
is
that
what
you
been
worrying
about
i
thought
developed
the
work
habit
or
something
ward
all
right
he
out
on
the
tiles
tonight
gone
to
a
dinner
at
philpott
man
how
do
you
know
are
you
certain
him
telling
prater
this
morning
half
the
staff
have
gone
good
opportunity
for
a
chap
to
go
for
a
stroll
if
he
wanted
to
shall
we
by
the
way
for
me
thanks
i
in
the
middle
of
a
rather
special
book
ever
read
dickens
you
know
know
have
read
it
though
always
rather
funk
starting
on
a
classic
somehow
good
dear
chap
good
not
the
word
after
you
exit
livy
then
and
a
good
job
too
you
might
pass
us
the
great
sherlock
thanks
he
plunged
with
the
great
detective
into
the
mystery
of
the
speckled
band
while
vaughan
opened
at
the
place
where
he
had
left
off
the
night
before
and
a
silence
fell
upon
the
study
curiously
enough
dallas
was
not
the
only
member
of
ward
house
to
whom
it
occurred
that
evening
that
the
absence
of
the
supplied
a
good
opportunity
for
a
stroll
the
idea
had
also
struck
plunkett
favourably
he
was
not
feeling
very
comfortable
on
entering
the
senior
study
he
found
galloway
an
upper
fourth
member
of
the
house
already
in
possession
galloway
had
managed
that
evening
to
insinuate
himself
with
such
success
into
the
good
graces
of
the
matron
that
he
had
been
allowed
to
stay
in
the
house
instead
of
proceeding
with
the
rest
of
the
study
to
the
great
hall
for
preparation
the
palpable
failure
of
his
attempt
to
hide
the
book
he
was
reading
under
the
table
when
he
was
disturbed
led
him
to
cast
at
the
mutual
friend
the
cause
of
his
panic
so
severe
and
forbidding
a
look
that
that
gentleman
retired
and
made
for
the
junior
study
the
atmosphere
in
the
junior
study
was
close
and
heavy
with
a
blend
of
several
strange
odours
plunkett
went
to
the
window
then
he
noticed
what
he
had
never
noticed
before
that
there
were
no
bars
to
the
window
only
the
glass
stood
between
him
and
the
outer
world
he
threw
up
the
sash
as
far
as
it
would
go
there
was
plenty
of
room
to
get
out
so
he
got
out
he
stood
for
a
moment
inhaling
the
fresh
air
then
taking
something
from
his
he
dived
into
the
shadows
an
hour
passed
in
the
study
above
dallas
surfeited
with
mysteries
and
villainy
put
down
his
book
and
stretched
himself
say
vaughan
he
said
you
settled
the
house
gym
team
yet
it
about
time
the
list
went
up
what
said
vaughan
coming
slowly
out
of
his
book
dallas
repeated
his
question
said
vaughan
it
somewhere
on
me
haynes
jarvis
and
myself
are
going
in
only
the
mutual
has
to
stick
up
the
list
it
was
the
unwritten
rule
in
ward
as
in
most
of
the
other
houses
at
the
school
that
none
but
the
head
of
the
house
had
the
right
of
placing
notices
on
the
house
board
know
said
dallas
go
and
buck
him
up
now
trouble
after
prayers
do
all
right
no
trouble
whom
did
you
say
yourself
haynes
jarvis
not
that
he
any
good
but
the
third
string
never
matters
much
and
it
do
him
good
to
represent
the
house
i
go
and
unearth
the
mutual
the
result
was
that
galloway
received
another
shock
to
his
system
glare
galloway
it
rude
said
dallas
plunkett
got
to
he
added
study
said
galloway
dallas
went
to
the
junior
study
there
were
plunkett
books
on
the
table
but
of
their
owner
no
signs
were
to
be
seen
the
mutual
friend
had
had
the
good
sense
to
close
the
window
after
he
had
climbed
through
it
and
dallas
did
not
suspect
what
had
actually
happened
he
returned
to
vaughan
mutual
is
in
either
of
the
studies
he
said
did
want
to
spend
the
evening
playing
with
him
so
i
come
back
does
matter
thanks
all
the
same
later
on
do
just
as
well
you
object
to
the
window
going
up
asked
dallas
a
bit
of
a
froust
on
in
here
not
heave
it
up
dallas
hove
it
he
stood
leaning
out
looking
towards
the
college
buildings
which
stood
out
black
and
clear
against
the
april
sky
from
out
of
the
darkness
in
the
direction
of
stapleton
sounded
the
monotonous
note
of
a
he
said
a
grand
night
if
i
was
at
home
now
i
be
cooped
up
indoors
like
this
in
another
week
said
vaughan
joining
him
is
ripping
is
it
there
something
not
half
bad
in
the
coll
buildings
on
a
night
like
this
i
shall
be
jolly
sorry
to
leave
in
spite
of
ward
and
the
mutual
here
by
jove
we
each
got
a
couple
more
years
though
if
it
comes
to
that
hullo
prep
over
the
sound
of
footsteps
began
to
be
heard
from
the
direction
of
the
college
nine
had
struck
from
the
school
clock
and
the
great
hall
was
emptying
turn
to
read
at
prayers
vaughan
hullo
there
the
mutual
did
hear
him
unlock
the
door
glad
he
has
though
saves
us
trouble
must
be
going
down
to
look
up
a
bit
to
read
do
you
remember
when
harper
read
the
same
bit
six
days
running
i
shall
never
forget
pained
expression
harper
explained
that
he
thought
the
passage
so
beautiful
that
he
could
leave
it
do
you
try
that
tip
my
reputation
has
quite
the
stamina
for
the
test
vaughan
left
the
room
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
was
met
by
the
matron
you
unlock
the
door
please
vaughan
she
said
handing
him
a
bunch
of
keys
boys
will
be
coming
in
in
a
minute
the
door
repeated
vaughan
thought
it
was
unlocked
all
right
jove
he
thought
plot
thickens
what
is
our
only
plunkett
doing
out
of
the
house
when
the
door
is
locked
i
wonder
plunkett
strolled
in
with
the
last
batch
of
the
returning
crowd
wearing
on
his
face
the
virtuous
look
of
one
who
has
been
snatching
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
after
a
hard
evening
preparation
i
say
plunkett
said
vaughan
when
they
met
in
the
study
after
prayers
wanted
to
see
you
where
have
you
been
have
been
in
the
junior
study
where
did
you
think
i
had
been
you
doubt
my
word
the
most
exaggerated
respect
for
your
word
but
you
were
in
the
junior
study
at
five
to
nine
i
went
up
to
my
dormitory
about
that
time
you
seem
remarkably
interested
in
my
movements
wanted
to
see
you
about
the
house
gym
team
you
might
shove
up
the
list
tonight
haynes
jarvis
and
myself
well
did
say
anything
to
him
said
vaughan
to
dallas
as
they
were
going
to
their
dormitories
you
know
there
something
jolly
fishy
about
the
mutual
that
door
was
unlocked
when
we
saw
him
outside
i
unlocked
it
myself
seems
to
me
the
mutual
been
having
a
little
private
bust
of
his
own
on
the
quiet
rum
he
might
have
been
out
by
the
front
way
to
see
one
of
the
beaks
though
even
then
he
would
be
breaking
rules
you
are
allowed
to
go
out
after
without
house
beak
leave
no
i
find
him
guilty
only
he
go
and
get
booked
said
vaughan
he
might
have
to
leave
but
he
wo
no
such
luck
said
dallas
certainly
there
was
something
mysterious
about
the
matter
a
literary
banquet
charteris
and
welch
were
conversing
in
the
study
of
which
they
were
the
joint
proprietors
that
is
to
say
charteris
was
talking
and
playing
the
banjo
alternately
while
welch
was
deep
in
a
book
and
refused
to
be
drawn
out
of
it
under
any
pretext
charteris
banjo
was
the
joy
of
his
fellows
and
the
bane
of
his
being
of
a
musical
turn
and
owning
a
good
deal
of
he
had
at
the
end
of
the
summer
holidays
introduced
the
delights
of
a
phonograph
into
the
house
this
being
vetoed
by
the
he
had
returned
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
term
with
a
penny
whistle
which
had
suffered
a
similar
fate
upon
this
he
had
invested
in
a
banjo
and
the
dazed
merevale
feeling
that
matters
were
getting
beyond
his
grip
had
effected
a
compromise
with
him
having
ascertained
that
there
was
no
specific
rule
at
st
austin
against
the
use
of
musical
instruments
he
had
informed
charteris
that
if
he
saw
fit
to
play
the
banjo
before
prep
only
and
regarded
the
hours
between
seven
and
eleven
as
a
close
time
all
should
be
forgiven
and
he
might
play
if
so
disposed
till
the
crack
of
doom
to
this
reasonable
request
charteris
had
promptly
acceded
and
peace
had
been
restored
charteris
and
welch
were
a
curious
pair
welch
spoke
very
little
charteris
was
seldom
silent
they
were
both
in
the
sixth
welch
high
up
charteris
rather
low
down
in
games
welch
was
one
of
those
fortunate
individuals
who
are
good
at
everything
he
was
captain
of
cricket
and
not
only
captain
but
also
the
best
man
in
the
team
which
is
often
a
very
different
matter
he
was
the
best
wing
the
school
possessed
played
fives
and
racquets
like
a
professor
and
only
the
day
before
had
shared
tony
glory
by
winning
the
silver
medal
for
fencing
in
the
aldershot
competition
the
abilities
of
charteris
were
more
ordinary
he
was
a
sound
bat
and
went
in
first
for
the
eleven
and
played
half
for
the
fifteen
as
regards
work
he
might
have
been
brilliant
if
he
had
chosen
but
his
energies
were
mainly
devoted
to
the
compilation
of
a
monthly
magazine
strictly
unofficial
entitled
glow
this
he
edited
and
for
the
most
part
wrote
himself
it
was
a
clever
periodical
and
rarely
failed
to
bring
him
in
at
least
ten
shillings
per
number
after
deducting
the
expenses
which
the
college
bookseller
who
acted
as
sole
agent
did
his
best
to
make
as
big
as
possible
only
a
very
few
of
the
elect
knew
the
identity
of
the
editor
and
they
were
bound
to
strict
secrecy
on
the
day
before
the
publication
of
each
number
a
notice
was
placed
in
the
desk
of
the
captain
of
each
form
notifying
him
of
what
the
morrow
would
bring
forth
and
asking
him
to
pass
it
round
the
form
that
was
all
the
school
did
the
rest
glow
always
sold
well
principally
because
of
the
personal
nature
of
its
contents
if
the
average
mortal
is
told
that
there
is
something
about
him
in
a
paper
he
will
buy
that
paper
at
your
own
price
today
he
was
giving
his
monthly
tea
in
honour
of
the
new
number
only
contributors
were
invited
and
the
menu
was
always
of
the
best
it
was
a
dinner
only
more
so
for
these
teas
were
celebrated
with
musical
honours
and
charteris
on
the
banjo
was
worth
hearing
his
rendering
of
extracts
from
the
works
of
messrs
gilbert
and
sullivan
was
an
intellectual
treat
i
take
the
chair
at
our
harmonic
club
he
chanted
fixing
the
unconscious
welch
with
a
fiery
glance
this
is
your
idea
of
a
harmonic
club
it
is
mine
put
down
that
book
and
try
and
be
sociable
second
said
welch
burrowing
still
deeper
what
you
always
say
said
charteris
here
come
in
there
had
been
a
knock
at
the
door
as
he
was
speaking
tony
entered
accompanied
by
jim
they
were
regular
attendants
at
these
banquets
for
between
them
they
wrote
most
of
what
was
left
of
the
magazine
when
charteris
had
done
with
it
there
was
only
one
other
contributor
jackson
of
dawson
house
and
he
came
in
a
few
minutes
later
welch
was
the
athletics
expert
of
the
paper
and
did
most
of
the
match
reports
we
complete
said
charteris
as
jackson
presented
himself
your
seats
there
are
only
four
chairs
and
we
as
wordsworth
might
have
said
but
did
are
five
all
right
i
sit
on
the
table
welch
you
worm
away
with
melancholy
take
away
his
book
somebody
that
right
who
says
what
tea
already
made
coffee
published
shortly
if
anybody
wants
cocoa
i
got
some
only
have
to
boil
more
water
i
regret
the
absence
of
but
as
the
entire
feast
is
visible
to
the
naked
eye
our
loss
is
immaterial
the
offertory
will
be
for
the
church
expenses
fund
biscuits
please
wish
you
given
this
tea
after
next
saturday
alderman
said
jim
charteris
was
called
the
alderman
on
account
of
his
figure
which
was
inclined
to
stoutness
and
his
general
capacity
for
consuming
food
put
off
till
tomorrow
why
simply
must
keep
fit
for
the
mile
how
welch
to
run
too
if
he
eats
this
sort
of
thing
he
pointed
to
the
board
there
something
in
that
said
tony
goodness
my
little
entertainment
over
i
think
i
try
one
of
those
chocolate
things
thanks
is
all
right
said
jackson
could
win
the
hundred
and
the
quarter
on
but
think
of
the
times
there
observed
charteris
my
young
friend
you
have
touched
upon
a
sore
subject
before
you
came
in
i
was
administering
a
few
wholesome
words
of
censure
to
that
miserable
object
on
your
right
what
is
a
fifth
of
a
second
more
or
less
that
it
should
make
a
man
insult
his
digestion
as
welch
does
you
hardly
credit
it
but
for
the
last
three
weeks
or
more
i
have
been
forced
to
look
on
a
refusing
pastry
and
drinking
beastly
extracts
of
meat
all
for
the
sake
of
winning
a
couple
of
races
it
quite
put
me
off
my
feed
cake
please
good
robust
slice
thanks
rather
funny
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
said
tony
lives
on
bovril
for
a
month
and
then
just
as
he
thinks
he
going
to
score
a
burglar
with
a
sense
of
humour
strolls
into
the
carefully
selects
the
only
two
cups
he
had
a
chance
of
winning
and
so
to
bed
master
welch
an
awful
example
of
what
comes
of
training
said
jim
you
a
rotter
is
my
fault
observed
welch
plaintively
chaps
seem
to
think
i
committed
some
sort
of
crime
just
because
a
man
i
know
from
adam
has
bagged
a
cup
or
two
looks
to
me
said
charteris
if
welch
thinking
his
chances
of
the
quarter
rather
rocky
hired
one
of
his
low
acquaintances
to
steal
the
cup
for
him
wonder
welch
knows
some
jolly
low
characters
in
stapleton
is
a
jolly
low
character
himself
said
tony
judicially
wonder
you
associate
with
him
alderman
loco
aunt
of
his
asked
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
dear
george
is
so
wild
she
said
before
welch
could
find
words
to
refute
this
hideous
slander
tony
cut
in
once
more
only
reason
he
does
drink
gin
and
play
billiards
at
the
blue
lion
is
that
gin
makes
him
ill
and
his
best
break
at
pills
is
six
including
two
flukes
a
matter
of
fact
said
welch
changing
the
conversation
with
a
jerk
do
much
care
if
the
cups
are
stolen
one

groaned
well
said
he
you
going
to
take
the
high
moral
standpoint
and
descend
to
brazen
platitudes
like
that
i
give
you
up
a
rum
thing
about
those
pots
said
welch
meditatively
to
me
jim
rejoined
rum
thing
is
that
a
man
who
considers
the
pav
a
safe
place
to
keep
a
lot
of
valuable
prizes
in
should
be
allowed
at
large
why
could
they
keep
them
in
the
board
room
as
they
used
to
it
save
trouble
i
suppose
save
them
carting
the
things
over
to
the
pav
on
sports
day
hazarded
tony
the
burglar
a
lot
of
trouble
i
should
say
observed
jackson
could
break
into
the
pav
myself
in
five
minutes
old
jackson
said
charteris
a
shot
tonight
i
hold
the
watch
i
doing
a
leader
on
the
melancholy
incident
for
next
it
appears
that
master
reginald
robinson
a
member
of
mr
merevale
celebrated
was
passing
by
the
pavilion
at
an
early
hour
on
the
morning
of
the
second
of
april
today
when
his
eye
was
attracted
by
an
excavation
or
incision
in
one
of
the
windows
of
that
imposing
edifice
his
narrative
appears
on
another
page
interviewed
by
a
representative
master
robinson
who
is
a
fine
healthy
bronzed
young
englishman
of
some
thirteen
summers
with
a
delightful
boyish
flow
of
speech
not
wholly
free
from
a
suspicion
of
cheek
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
outrage
was
the
work
of
a
burglar
a
remarkable
display
of
sagacity
in
one
so
young
a
portrait
of
master
robinson
appears
on
another
page
seems
to
appear
on
another
page
said
jim
i
to
do
the
portrait
think
it
would
be
best
you
can
never
trust
a
photo
to
caricature
a
person
enough
your
facial
the
thing
you
heard
whether
anything
else
was
bagged
besides
the
cups
asked
welch
that
i
know
of
said
jim
there
was
said
jackson
further
appears
that
that
lunatic
adamson
had
left
some
money
in
the
pocket
of
his
blazer
which
he
had
left
in
the
pav
overnight
on
enquiry
it
was
found
that
the
money
had
also
left
adamson
was
in
the
same
house
as
jackson
and
had
talked
of
nothing
else
throughout
the
whole
of
lunch
he
was
an
abnormally
wealthy
individual
however
and
it
was
generally
felt
though
he
himself
thought
otherwise
that
he
could
afford
to
lose
some
of
the
surplus
much
asked
jim
pounds
at
this
jim
gave
vent
to
the
exclamation
which
mr
barry
pain
calls
the
englishman
shortest
prayer
dear
sir
said
charteris
very
dear
sir
we
blush
for
you
might
i
ask
you
take
the
matter
to
heart
so
jim
hesitated
have
it
out
jim
said
tony
chaps
keep
it
dark
all
right
and
jim
entered
once
again
upon
the
recital
of
his
doings
on
the
previous
night
you
see
he
concluded
two
pound
business
makes
it
all
the
worse
do
see
why
said
welch
you
see
money
a
thing
everybody
wants
whereas
cups
be
any
good
to
a
fellow
at
school
so
that
i
should
find
it
much
harder
to
prove
that
i
did
take
the
two
pounds
than
i
should
have
done
to
prove
that
i
did
take
the
cups
there
no
earthly
need
for
you
to
prove
anything
said
tony
not
the
slightest
chance
of
your
being
found
out
observed
charteris
will
certainly
respect
your
incog
if
you
wish
it
wild
horses
shall
draw
no
evidence
from
us
it
is
of
course
very
distressing
but
what
is
man
after
all
are
we
not
as
the
beasts
that
perish
and
is
not
our
little
life
rounded
by
a
sleep
indeed
yes
and
now
with
full
chorus
please
take
him
from
the
city
or
the
plough
dress
him
up
in
uniform
so
and
at
the
third
line
some
plaster
came
down
from
the
ceiling
and
merevale
came
up
and
the
meeting
dispersed
without
the
customary
cheers
barrett
explores
barrett
stood
at
the
window
of
his
study
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
football
field
now
and
then
he
whistled
that
was
to
show
that
he
was
very
much
at
his
ease
he
whistled
a
popular
melody
of
the
day
three
times
as
slowly
as
its
talented
composer
had
originally
intended
it
to
be
whistled
and
in
a
strange
minor
key
some
people
when
offended
invariably
whistle
in
this
manner
and
these
are
just
the
people
with
whom
if
you
happen
to
share
a
study
with
them
it
is
rash
to
have
differences
of
opinion
reade
who
was
deep
in
a
book
though
not
so
deep
as
he
would
have
liked
the
casual
observer
to
fancy
him
to
be
would
have
given
much
to
stop
barrett
musical
experiments
to
ask
him
to
stop
in
so
many
words
was
of
course
impossible
offended
dignity
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
that
is
one
of
the
curious
results
of
a
polite
education
when
two
gentlemen
of
hoxton
or
the
borough
have
a
misunderstanding
they
address
one
another
with
even
more
freedom
than
is
their
usual
custom
when
one
member
of
a
public
school
falls
out
with
another
member
his
politeness
in
dealing
with
him
becomes
so
chesterfieldian
that
one
can
not
help
being
afraid
that
he
will
sustain
a
strain
from
which
he
will
never
recover
after
a
time
the
tension
became
too
much
for
barrett
he
picked
up
his
cap
and
left
the
room
reade
continued
to
be
absorbed
in
his
book
it
was
a
splendid
day
outside
warm
for
april
and
with
just
that
freshness
in
the
air
which
gets
into
the
blood
and
makes
spring
the
best
time
of
the
whole
year
barrett
had
not
the
aesthetic
soul
to
any
appreciable
extent
but
he
did
know
a
fine
day
when
he
saw
one
and
even
he
realized
that
a
day
like
this
was
not
to
be
wasted
in
pottering
about
the
school
grounds
watching
the
thirteen
hundred
yards
trial
heats
and
the
fourteen
broad
jump
or
doing
occasional
exercises
in
the
gymnasium
it
was
a
day
for
going
far
afield
and
not
returning
till
he
had
an
object
too
everything
seemed
to
shout
at
him
to
remind
him
that
he
was
an
enthusiast
on
the
subject
and
had
a
collection
to
which
he
ought
to
seize
this
excellent
opportunity
of
adding
the
only
question
was
where
to
go
the
surrounding
country
was
a
paradise
for
the
naturalist
who
had
no
absurd
scruples
on
the
subject
of
trespassing
to
the
west
in
the
direction
of
stapleton
the
woods
and
hedges
were
thick
with
nests
but
then
so
they
were
to
the
east
along
the
badgwick
road
he
wavered
but
a
recollection
that
there
was
water
in
the
badgwick
direction
and
that
he
might
with
luck
beard
a
in
its
lair
decided
him
what
is
life
without
a
egg
a
mere
mockery
he
turned
east
barrett
where
are
you
off
to
grey
of
prater
house
intercepted
him
as
he
was
passing
to
see
if
i
can
get
some
eggs
are
you
coming
grey
hesitated
he
was
a
keen
naturalist
too
i
do
think
i
will
thanks
got
an
uncle
coming
down
to
see
me
cut
off
before
he
comes
he
be
too
sick
besides
he
added
ingenuously
a
possible
tip
do
want
to
miss
that
i
simply
stony
always
am
at
end
of
term
said
barrett
realizing
that
further
argument
would
be
thrown
away
so
long
then
long
hope
you
have
luck
i
say
you
know
if
you
do
see
me
anywhere
about
you
might
answer
my
name
right
and
if
you
find
anything
decent
you
might
remember
me
you
know
pretty
well
what
i
got
already
i
will
what
i
want
particularly
where
are
you
going
by
the
way
of
having
a
shot
at
old
venner
woods
i
after
a
myself
ought
to
be
one
or
two
in
the
dingle
probably
but
i
should
advise
you
to
look
out
you
know
venner
awfully
down
on
trespassing
the
bounder
but
i
do
think
he
get
me
one
gets
the
knack
of
keeping
fairly
quiet
with
practice
got
thousands
of
keepers
too
his
beastly
dogs
i
like
dogs
why
are
you
such
a
croaker
today
grey
you
know
he
had
two
chaps
sacked
for
going
in
his
woods
to
my
certain
knowledge
and
ainsworth
that
only
since
been
at
the
too
probably
lots
more
before
that
was
booked
smoking
there
that
why
he
was
sacked
and
venner
caught
himself
simply
staggering
under
dead
rabbits
they
sack
any
chap
for
poaching
i
do
see
how
you
going
to
show
you
not
been
poaching
besides
it
miles
out
of
bounds
said
barrett
severely
surprised
at
you
go
away
and
meet
your
beastly
uncle
fancy
talking
about
bounds
at
your
time
of
life
do
forget
me
when
you
hauling
in
the
eggs
you
are
so
long
barrett
proceeded
on
his
way
his
last
difficulty
safely
removed
he
could
rely
on
grey
not
to
bungle
that
matter
of
grey
had
been
there
before
a
long
white
ribbon
of
dusty
road
separated
st
austin
from
the
lodge
gates
of
badgwick
hall
the
country
seat
of
sir
alfred
venner
also
of
lancaster
gate
london
barrett
walked
rapidly
for
over
before
he
came
in
sight
of
the
great
iron
gates
flanked
on
the
one
side
by
a
trim
little
lodge
and
green
meadows
and
on
the
other
by
woods
of
a
darker
green
having
got
so
far
he
went
on
up
the
hill
till
at
last
he
arrived
at
his
destination
a
small
hedge
a
sloping
strip
of
green
and
then
the
famous
dingle
i
am
loath
to
inflict
any
scenic
rhapsodies
on
the
reader
but
really
the
dingle
deserves
a
line
or
two
it
was
the
most
beautiful
spot
in
a
country
noted
for
its
fine
scenery
dense
woods
were
its
chief
feature
and
by
dense
i
mean
not
only
with
trees
excellent
things
in
themselves
but
for
the
most
part
useless
to
the
nest
hunter
but
also
with
a
fascinating
tangle
of
undergrowth
where
every
bush
seemed
to
harbour
eggs
all
carefully
preserved
too
that
was
the
chief
charm
of
the
place
since
the
sad
episodes
of
and
ainsworth
the
school
for
the
most
part
had
looked
askance
at
the
dingle
once
a
select
party
from
dacre
house
headed
by
babington
who
always
got
himself
into
hot
water
when
possible
had
ventured
into
the
forbidden
land
and
had
returned
hurriedly
later
in
the
afternoon
with
every
sign
of
exhaustion
hinting
breathlessly
at
keepers
dogs
and
a
pursuit
that
had
lasted
fifty
minutes
without
a
check
since
then
no
one
had
been
daring
enough
to
brave
the
terrors
so
carefully
prepared
for
them
by
milord
sir
venner
and
his
minions
and
the
proud
owner
of
the
dingle
walked
his
woods
in
solitary
state
occasionally
he
would
personally
conduct
some
favoured
guest
thither
and
show
him
the
wonders
of
the
place
but
this
was
not
a
frequent
occurrence
on
frequent
occasions
there
were
large
shooting
parties
in
the
dingle
but
as
a
rule
the
word
was
only
no
others
need
apply
a
futile
iron
railing
some
three
feet
in
height
shut
in
the
dingle
barrett
jumped
this
lightly
and
entered
forthwith
into
paradise
the
place
was
full
of
nests
as
barrett
took
a
step
forward
there
was
a
sudden
whirring
of
wings
and
a
bird
rose
from
a
bush
close
beside
him
he
went
to
inspect
and
found
a
nest
with
seven
eggs
in
it
only
a
thrush
of
course
as
no
one
ever
wants
thrushes
eggs
the
world
is
with
them
still
it
gave
promise
of
good
things
to
come
barrett
pushed
on
through
the
bushes
and
the
promise
was
fulfilled
he
came
upon
another
nest
five
eggs
this
time
of
a
variety
he
was
unable
with
his
moderate
knowledge
to
classify
at
any
rate
he
had
not
got
them
in
his
collection
nor
to
the
best
of
his
belief
had
grey
he
took
one
for
each
of
them
now
this
was
all
very
well
thought
barrett
but
what
he
had
come
for
was
the
ovular
deposit
of
the
through
the
trees
he
could
see
the
silver
gleam
of
the
brook
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
woods
sloped
down
to
the
very
edge
then
came
the
brook
widening
out
here
into
the
size
of
a
small
river
then
woods
again
all
up
the
side
of
the
opposite
hill
barrett
hurried
down
the
slope
he
had
put
on
flannels
for
this
emergency
he
was
prepared
to
wade
to
swim
if
necessary
he
hoped
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
in
april
water
is
generally
inclined
to
be
chilly
of
keepers
he
had
up
till
now
seen
no
sign
once
he
had
heard
the
distant
bark
of
a
dog
it
seemed
to
come
from
far
across
the
stream
and
he
had
not
troubled
about
it
in
the
midst
of
the
bushes
on
the
bank
stood
a
tree
it
was
not
tall
compared
to
the
other
trees
of
the
dingle
but
standing
alone
as
it
did
amongst
the
undergrowth
it
attracted
the
eye
at
once
barrett
looking
at
it
saw
something
which
made
him
forget
for
the
moment
in
a
fork
in
one
of
the
upper
branches
was
a
nest
an
enormous
nest
roughly
constructed
of
sticks
it
was
a
very
residence
evidently
run
up
for
the
season
by
some
prudent
bird
who
knew
by
experience
that
no
nest
could
last
through
the
winter
and
so
had
declined
to
waste
his
time
in
useless
decorative
work
but
what
bird
was
it
no
doubt
there
are
experts
to
whom
a
nest
is
something
apart
and
distinct
from
the
nest
of
the
magpie
but
to
your
unsophisticated
amateur
a
nest
that
is
large
may
be
anything
rook
magpie
pigeon
or
great
auk
to
such
an
one
the
only
true
test
lies
in
the
eggs
barrett
laid
the
containing
the
precious
specimens
he
had
found
in
the
nest
at
the
top
of
the
hill
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
began
to
climb
it
was
to
be
a
day
of
surprises
for
him
when
he
had
got
half
way
up
he
found
himself
on
a
kind
of
ledge
which
appeared
to
be
a
kind
of
junction
at
which
the
tree
branched
off
into
two
parts
to
the
left
was
the
nest
high
up
in
its
fork
to
the
right
was
another
shoot
he
realized
at
once
with
keen
disappointment
that
it
would
be
useless
to
go
further
the
branches
were
obviously
not
strong
enough
to
bear
his
weight
he
looked
down
preparatory
to
commencing
the
descent
and
to
his
astonishment
found
himself
looking
into
a
black
cavern
in
his
eagerness
to
reach
the
nest
he
had
not
noticed
before
that
the
tree
was
hollow
this
made
up
for
a
great
many
things
his
disappointment
became
less
keen
few
things
are
more
interesting
than
a
hollow
tree
how
deep
it
goes
down
he
said
to
himself
he
broke
off
a
piece
of
wood
and
dropped
it
down
the
hollow
it
seemed
to
reach
the
ground
uncommonly
soon
he
tried
another
piece
the
sound
of
its
fall
came
up
to
him
almost
simultaneously
evidently
the
hole
was
not
deep
he
placed
his
hands
on
the
edge
and
let
himself
gently
down
into
the
darkness
his
feet
touched
something
solid
almost
immediately
as
far
as
he
could
judge
the
depth
of
the
cavity
was
not
more
than
five
feet
standing
up
at
his
full
height
he
could
just
rest
his
chin
on
the
edge
he
seemed
to
be
standing
on
some
sort
of
a
floor
roughly
made
but
too
regular
to
be
the
work
of
nature
evidently
someone
had
been
here
before
he
bent
down
to
make
certain
there
was
more
room
to
move
about
in
than
he
suspected
a
man
sitting
down
would
find
it
not
uncomfortable
he
brushed
his
hand
along
the
floor
certainly
it
seemed
to
be
constructed
of
boards
then
his
hand
hit
something
small
and
hard
he
groped
about
until
his
fingers
closed
on
it
it
was
what
was
it
he
could
hardly
make
out
for
the
moment
suddenly
as
he
moved
it
something
inside
it
rattled
now
he
knew
what
it
was
it
was
the
very
thing
he
most
needed
a
box
of
matches
the
first
match
he
struck
promptly
and
naturally
went
out
no
first
match
ever
stays
alight
for
more
than
of
a
second
the
second
was
more
successful
the
sudden
light
dazzled
him
for
a
moment
when
his
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
the
match
went
out
he
lit
a
third
and
this
time
he
saw
all
round
the
little
chamber
scott
he
said
place
is
a
regular
poultry
shop
all
round
the
sides
were
hung
pheasants
and
partridges
in
various
stages
of
maturity
here
and
there
the
fur
of
a
rabbit
or
a
hare
showed
up
amongst
the
feathers
barrett
hit
on
the
solution
of
the
problem
directly
he
had
been
shown
a
similar
collection
once
in
a
tree
on
his
father
land
the
place
was
the
headquarters
of
some
poacher
barrett
was
full
of
admiration
for
the
ingenuity
of
the
man
in
finding
so
safe
a
he
continued
his
search
in
one
angle
of
the
tree
was
a
piece
of
sacking
barrett
lifted
it
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
bright
but
before
he
could
confirm
the
vague
suspicion
that
flashed
upon
him
his
match
burnt
down
and
lay
smouldering
on
the
floor
his
hand
trembled
with
excitement
as
he
started
to
light
another
it
broke
off
in
his
hand
at
last
he
succeeded
the
light
flashed
up
and
there
beside
the
piece
of
sacking
which
had
covered
them
were
two
cups
he
recognized
them
instantly
he
gasped
sports
pots
now
how
on
earth
at
this
moment
something
happened
which
took
his
attention
away
from
his
discovery
with
painful
suddenness
from
beneath
him
came
the
muffled
whine
of
a
dog
he
listened
holding
his
breath
no
he
was
not
mistaken
the
dog
whined
again
and
broke
into
an
excited
bark
somebody
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
began
to
speak
barrett
ceases
to
explore
said
the
voice
all
in
one
word
cheery
remark
to
make
thought
barrett
have
to
do
a
good
bit
of
digging
before
he
fetches
out
i
a
fixture
for
the
present
there
was
a
sound
of
scratching
as
if
the
dog
in
his
eagerness
to
oblige
were
trying
to
uproot
the
tree
barrett
realizing
that
unless
the
keeper
took
it
into
his
head
to
climb
which
was
unlikely
he
was
as
safe
as
if
he
had
been
in
his
study
at
philpott
chuckled
within
himself
and
listened
intently
is
it
then
said
the
keeper
dog
at
fetch
him
out
jack
jack
barked
excitedly
and
redoubled
his
efforts
the
sound
of
scratching
proceeded
said
the
mendacious
keeper
jack
had
evidently
paused
for
breath
barrett
began
quite
to
sympathize
with
him
the
thought
that
the
animal
was
getting
farther
away
from
the
object
of
his
search
with
every
ounce
of
earth
he
removed
tickled
him
hugely
he
would
have
liked
to
have
been
able
to
see
the
operations
though
at
present
it
was
like
listening
to
a
conversation
through
a
telephone
he
could
only
guess
at
what
was
going
on
then
he
heard
somebody
whistling
lincolnshire
poacher
a
strangely
inappropriate
air
in
the
mouth
of
a
keeper
the
sound
was
too
far
away
to
be
the
work
of
jack
owner
unless
he
had
gone
for
a
stroll
since
his
last
remark
no
it
was
another
keeper
a
new
voice
came
up
to
him
ned
what
the
dog
after
smelt
a
rabbit
seems
to
me
a
rabbit
hole
there
is
anyhow
look
at
the
pore
beast
they
both
laughed
jack
meanwhile
unaware
that
he
was
turning
himself
into
an
exhibition
to
make
a
keeper
holiday
dug
assiduously
away
jack
said
the
first
keeper
at
length
nothin
there
ought
to
know
that
clever
dog
like
you
there
was
a
sound
as
if
he
had
pulled
jack
bodily
from
his
hole
ned
what
that
on
the
ground
there
barrett
gasped
his
had
been
discovered
surely
they
would
put
two
and
two
together
now
and
climb
the
tree
after
him
two
of
did
they
get
then
one
of
them
young
devils
from
the
school
master
says
to
me
this
morning
look
out
says
saunders
for
them
boys
as
come
in
after
eggs
and
frighten
all
the
birds
out
of
the
dratted
place
you
keep
your
eyes
open
saunders
says
if
still
in
the
woods
we
safe
he
still
in
the
woods
thought
barrett
with
a
shiver
after
this
there
was
silence
barrett
waited
for
what
he
thought
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
really
five
minutes
or
less
then
he
peeped
cautiously
over
the
edge
of
his
yes
they
had
certainly
gone
unless
horrible
thought
they
were
waiting
so
close
to
the
trunk
of
the
tree
as
to
be
invisible
from
where
he
stood
he
decided
that
the
possibility
must
be
risked
he
was
down
on
the
ground
in
record
time
nothing
happened
no
hand
shot
out
from
its
ambush
to
clutch
him
he
breathed
more
freely
and
began
to
debate
within
himself
which
way
to
go
up
the
hill
it
must
be
of
course
but
should
he
go
straight
up
or
to
the
left
or
to
the
right
he
would
have
given
much
to
know
which
way
the
keepers
had
gone
particularly
he
of
the
dog
they
had
separated
he
knew
he
began
to
reason
the
thing
out
in
the
first
place
if
they
had
separated
they
must
have
gone
different
ways
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion
the
odds
therefore
were
that
one
had
gone
to
the
right
the
other
to
the
left
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
told
him
that
nobody
would
willingly
walk
if
it
was
possible
for
him
to
walk
on
the
flat
therefore
assuming
the
two
keepers
to
be
human
they
had
gone
along
the
valley
therefore
his
best
plan
would
be
to
make
straight
for
the
top
of
the
hill
as
straight
as
he
could
steer
and
risk
it
just
as
he
was
about
to
start
his
eye
caught
the
two
lying
on
the
turf
a
few
yards
from
where
he
had
placed
them
as
well
take
what
i
can
get
he
thought
he
placed
them
carefully
in
his
pocket
as
he
did
so
a
faint
bark
came
to
him
on
the
breeze
from
that
must
be
friend
jack
he
waited
no
longer
but
dived
into
the
bushes
in
the
direction
of
the
summit
he
was
congratulating
himself
on
being
out
of
danger
already
he
was
more
than
half
way
up
the
hill
when
suddenly
he
received
a
terrible
shock
from
the
bushes
to
his
left
not
ten
yards
from
where
he
stood
came
the
clear
sharp
sound
of
a
whistle
the
sound
was
repeated
and
this
time
an
answer
came
from
far
out
to
his
right
before
he
could
move
another
whistle
joined
in
again
from
the
left
but
farther
off
and
higher
up
the
hill
than
the
first
he
had
heard
he
recalled
what
grey
had
said
about
of
keepers
the
expression
he
thought
had
understated
the
true
facts
if
anything
he
remembered
the
case
of
babington
it
was
a
moment
for
action
no
guile
could
save
him
now
it
must
be
a
stern
chase
for
the
rest
of
the
distance
he
drew
a
breath
and
was
off
like
an
arrow
the
noise
he
made
was
appalling
no
one
in
the
wood
could
help
hearing
it
there
shouted
someone
the
voice
came
from
behind
a
fact
which
he
noted
almost
automatically
and
rejoiced
at
he
had
a
start
at
any
rate
shouted
the
voice
once
again
the
whistle
blew
like
a
steam
siren
and
once
more
the
other
two
answered
it
they
were
all
behind
him
now
surely
a
man
of
the
public
schools
in
flannels
and
gymnasium
shoes
and
trained
to
the
last
ounce
for
just
such
a
sprint
as
this
could
beat
a
handful
of
keepers
in
their
leggings
and
heavy
boots
barrett
raced
on
close
behind
him
a
crashing
in
the
undergrowth
and
the
sound
of
heavy
breathing
told
him
that
keeper
number
one
was
doing
his
best
to
left
and
right
similar
sounds
were
to
be
heard
but
barrett
had
placed
these
competitors
out
of
the
running
at
once
the
race
was
between
him
and
the
man
behind
fifty
yards
of
difficult
country
bushes
which
caught
his
clothes
as
if
they
were
trying
to
stop
him
in
the
interests
of
law
and
order
branches
which
lashed
him
across
the
face
and
half
hidden
in
the
bracken
and
still
he
kept
his
lead
he
was
increasing
it
he
must
win
now
the
man
behind
was
panting
in
deep
gasps
for
the
pace
had
been
warm
and
he
was
not
in
training
barrett
cast
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
and
as
he
looked
the
keeper
foot
caught
in
a
hole
and
he
fell
heavily
barrett
uttered
a
shout
of
triumph
victory
was
his
in
front
of
him
was
a
small
hollow
fringed
with
bushes
collecting
his
strength
he
cleared
these
with
a
bound
then
another
of
the
events
of
this
eventful
afternoon
happened
instead
of
the
hard
turf
his
foot
struck
something
soft
something
which
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
yell
barrett
rolled
down
the
slope
and
halfway
up
the
other
side
like
a
shot
rabbit
dimly
he
recognized
that
he
had
jumped
on
to
a
human
being
the
figure
did
not
wear
the
official
velveteens
therefore
he
had
no
business
in
the
dingle
and
close
behind
thundered
the
keeper
now
on
his
feet
once
more
dust
on
his
clothes
and
wrath
in
his
heart
in
equal
proportions
out
man
shouted
barrett
as
the
injured
person
rose
to
his
feet
cut
quick
keeper
there
was
no
time
to
say
more
he
ran
another
second
and
he
was
at
the
top
over
the
railing
and
in
the
good
honest
public
again
safe
a
hoarse
shout
of
yer
from
below
told
a
harrowing
tale
of
capture
the
stranger
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
very
cautiously
barrett
left
the
road
and
crept
to
the
railing
again
it
was
a
rash
thing
to
do
but
curiosity
overcame
him
he
had
to
see
or
if
that
was
impossible
to
hear
what
had
happened
for
a
moment
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
the
gasping
of
the
keeper
after
a
few
seconds
a
rapidly
nearing
series
of
crashes
announced
the
arrival
of
the
man
from
the
right
flank
of
the
pursuing
forces
while
almost
simultaneously
his
colleague
on
the
left
came
up
barrett
could
see
nothing
but
it
was
easy
to
understand
what
was
going
on
keeper
number
one
was
exhibiting
his
prisoner
his
narrative
punctuated
with
gasps
was
told
mostly
in
hoarse
whispers
and
barrett
missed
most
of
it
gasp
more
gasps
agen
minute
indistinct
mutterings
and
triumphantly
cotched
im
exclamations
of
approval
from
the
other
two
assure
you
said
another
voice
the
prisoner
was
having
his
say
assure
you
that
i
was
doing
no
harm
whatever
in
this
wood
i
tell
that
tale
to
sir
alfred
cut
in
one
of
his
captors
learn
yer
said
the
keeper
previously
referred
to
as
number
one
vindictively
he
was
feeling
shaken
up
with
his
run
and
his
heavy
fall
and
his
temper
was
proportionately
short
swear
i
heard
that
voice
before
somewhere
thought
barrett
if
it
a
coll
chap
keeper
number
one
added
something
here
which
was
inaudible
to
barrett
tell
you
i
not
a
poacher
said
the
prisoner
indignantly
i
object
to
your
language
i
tell
you
i
was
lying
here
doing
nothing
and
some
fool
or
other
came
and
jumped
on
me
i
the
rest
was
inaudible
but
barrett
had
heard
enough
knew
i
heard
that
voice
before
plunkett
by
jove
golly
what
is
the
world
coming
to
when
heads
of
houses
and
go
on
the
poach
fancy
plunkett
of
all
people
too
this
is
a
hanged
if
it
is
from
below
came
the
sound
of
movement
the
keepers
were
going
down
the
hill
again
to
barrett
guilty
conscience
it
seemed
that
they
were
coming
up
he
turned
and
fled
the
hedge
separating
sir
alfred
venner
land
from
the
road
was
not
a
high
one
though
the
drop
the
other
side
was
considerable
barrett
had
not
reckoned
on
this
he
leapt
the
hedge
and
staggered
across
the
road
at
the
same
moment
a
cyclist
who
was
pedalling
in
a
leisurely
manner
in
the
direction
of
the
school
arrived
at
the
spot
a
collision
seemed
imminent
but
the
stranger
in
a
perfectly
composed
manner
as
if
he
had
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
to
take
a
sharp
turning
rode
his
machine
up
the
bank
whence
he
fell
with
easy
grace
to
the
road
just
in
time
to
act
as
a
cushion
for
barrett
the
two
lay
there
in
a
tangled
heap
barrett
was
the
first
to
rise
enter
the
awfully
sorry
he
said
disentangling
himself
carefully
from
the
heap
hope
you
not
hurt
the
man
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
he
appeared
to
be
laying
the
question
before
himself
as
an
impartial
judge
as
who
should
say
tell
me
candidly
you
hurt
speak
freely
and
without
bias
he
said
at
last
feeling
his
left
leg
as
if
he
were
not
absolutely
easy
in
his
mind
about
that
not
hurt
thank
you
not
much
that
is
he
added
with
the
air
of
one
who
thinks
it
best
to
qualify
too
positive
a
statement
leg
shin
slight
bruise
nothing
to
signify
was
a
rotten
thing
to
do
jumping
over
into
the
road
like
that
said
barrett
remember
there
be
such
a
big
drop
fault
in
a
way
said
the
man
wrong
side
of
road
out
for
a
run
or
less
thing
it
occurred
to
barrett
that
it
was
only
due
to
the
man
on
whom
he
had
been
rolling
to
tell
him
the
true
facts
of
the
case
besides
it
might
do
something
towards
removing
the
impression
which
must
he
felt
be
forming
in
the
stranger
mind
that
he
was
mad
see
he
said
in
a
burst
of
confidence
was
rather
a
close
thing
there
were
some
keepers
after
me
said
the
man
so
trespassing
keepers
do
like
trespassers
curious
thing
do
know
if
it
ever
occurred
to
you
if
there
were
no
trespassers
there
would
be
no
need
for
keepers
to
their
interest
then
to
encourage
trespassers
but
do
they
barrett
admitted
that
they
did
not
very
conspicuously
same
with
all
professions
not
poaching
i
suppose
not
i
was
after
eggs
by
jove
that
reminds
me
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
could
they
have
survived
the
stormy
times
through
which
they
had
been
passing
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
saw
that
the
eggs
were
uninjured
he
was
so
intent
on
examining
them
that
he
missed
the
stranger
next
remark
what
i
did
hear
if
i
was
going
right
for
st
austin
school
said
barrett
with
a
convulsive
shudder
the
most
deadly
error
mortal
man
can
make
with
the
exception
of
calling
a
school
a
college
is
to
call
a
college
a
school
said
the
man
this
the
road
you
ca
miss
it
i
going
there
myself
it
only
about
a
mile
said
the
man
with
a
touch
of
satisfaction
in
his
voice
there
yourself
are
you
perhaps
you
one
of
the
scholars
much
said
barrett
our
if
i
a
scholar
oh
i
see
yes
i
there
all
right
barrett
was
a
little
puzzled
as
to
how
to
class
his
companion
no
old
public
school
man
would
talk
of
scholars
and
yet
he
was
emphatically
not
a
bargee
barrett
set
him
down
as
a
sort
of
superior
tourist
a
henry
as
opposed
to
an
bit
of
a
disturbance
there
has
there
cricket
pavilion
cups
but
how
on
earth
on
earth
did
i
get
to
hear
of
it
you
were
going
to
say
well
no
need
to
conceal
anything
fact
is
down
here
to
look
into
the
matter
detective
name
roberts
scotland
yard
now
we
know
each
other
and
if
you
can
tell
me
one
or
two
things
about
this
burglary
it
would
be
a
great
help
to
me
and
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
barrett
had
heard
that
a
detective
was
coming
down
to
look
into
the
affair
of
the
cups
his
position
was
rather
a
difficult
one
in
a
sense
it
was
simple
enough
he
had
found
the
cups
he
could
keepers
permitting
go
and
fetch
them
now
and
there
would
no
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
matter
it
would
be
very
pleasant
exceedingly
pleasant
to
go
to
the
headmaster
and
the
detective
and
present
the
cups
to
them
with
a
you
my
children
air
the
headmaster
would
say
you
a
marvel
how
can
i
thank
you
sufficiently
while
the
detective
would
observe
that
he
had
been
in
the
profession
over
twenty
years
but
never
had
he
seen
so
remarkable
an
exhibition
of
sagacity
and
acumen
as
this
that
at
least
was
what
ought
to
take
place
but
barrett
experience
of
life
short
as
it
was
had
taught
him
the
difference
between
the
ideal
and
the
real
the
real
he
suspected
would
in
this
case
be
painful
certain
facts
would
come
to
light
when
had
he
found
the
cups
about
four
in
the
afternoon
oh
took
place
at
four
in
the
afternoon
how
came
it
that
he
was
not
at
furthermore
how
came
it
that
he
was
marked
on
the
list
as
having
answered
his
name
at
that
ceremony
where
had
he
found
the
cups
in
a
hollow
tree
just
so
where
was
the
hollow
tree
in
sir
alfred
venner
woods
did
he
know
that
sir
alfred
venner
woods
were
out
of
bounds
did
he
know
that
in
consequence
of
complaints
from
sir
alfred
venner
sir
alfred
venner
woods
were
more
out
of
bounds
than
any
other
out
of
bounds
woods
in
the
entire
county
that
did
belong
to
sir
alfred
venner
he
did
ah
no
the
word
for
his
guidance
in
this
emergency
he
felt
instinctively
was
time
might
provide
him
with
a
solution
he
might
for
instance
abstract
the
cups
secretly
from
their
place
them
in
the
middle
of
the
football
field
and
find
them
there
dramatically
after
morning
school
or
he
might
reveal
his
secret
from
the
carriage
window
as
his
train
moved
out
of
the
station
on
the
first
day
of
the
holidays
there
was
certain
to
be
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
but
for
the
present
silence
he
answered
his
companion
questions
freely
however
of
the
actual
burglary
he
knew
no
more
than
any
other
member
of
the
school
considerably
less
indeed
than
jim
thomson
of
merevale
at
present
staggering
under
the
weight
of
a
secret
even
more
gigantic
than
barrett
own
in
return
for
his
information
he
extracted
sundry
reminiscences
the
scar
on
the
detective
cheekbone
barely
visible
now
was
the
mark
of
a
bullet
which
a
certain
burglar
named
singularly
enough
roberts
had
fired
at
him
from
a
distance
of
five
yards
the
gentleman
in
question
who
the
detective
hastened
to
inform
barrett
was
no
relation
of
his
though
owning
the
same
name
happened
to
be
a
poor
marksman
and
only
scored
a
bad
outer
assuming
the
detective
face
to
have
been
the
bull
he
also
turned
up
his
cuff
to
show
a
larger
scar
this
was
another
testimonial
from
the
burglar
world
a
kensington
practitioner
had
had
the
bad
taste
to
bite
off
a
piece
of
that
part
of
the
detective
in
short
barrett
enlarged
his
knowledge
of
the
seamy
side
of
things
considerably
in
the
mile
of
road
which
had
to
be
traversed
before
st
austin
appeared
in
sight
the
two
parted
at
the
big
gates
barrett
going
in
the
direction
of
philpott
the
detective
wheeling
his
machine
towards
the
porter
lodge
barrett
condition
when
he
turned
in
at
philpott
door
was
critical
he
was
so
inflated
with
news
that
any
attempt
to
keep
it
in
might
have
serious
results
certainly
he
could
not
sleep
that
night
in
such
a
state
it
was
thus
that
he
broke
in
upon
reade
reade
had
passed
an
absurdly
useless
afternoon
he
had
not
stirred
from
the
study
for
all
that
it
would
have
mattered
to
him
it
might
have
been
raining
hard
the
whole
afternoon
instead
of
being
as
it
had
been
the
finest
afternoon
of
the
whole
term
in
a
word
and
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
the
matter
he
had
been
frousting
and
consequently
was
feeling
dull
and
sleepy
and
generally
and
futile
barrett
entered
the
study
with
a
rush
and
was
carried
away
by
excitement
to
such
an
extent
that
he
addressed
reade
as
if
the
deadly
feud
between
them
not
only
did
not
exist
but
never
had
existed
say
reade
heave
that
beastly
book
away
my
aunt
i
have
had
an
afternoon
of
it
said
reade
politely
did
you
go
eggs
in
the
dingle
reade
was
fairly
startled
out
of
his
dignified
reserve
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
had
their
little
difference
he
addressed
barrett
in
a
sensible
manner
idiot
he
said
see
it
the
dingle
just
the
place
to
spend
a
happy
day
like
rosherville
jove
it
worth
going
there
you
should
see
the
birds
place
is
black
with
about
keepers
see
any
i
not
three
of
them
chased
me
like
good
all
over
the
place
got
away
all
right
though
just
i
say
do
you
know
what
happened
you
know
that
rotter
plunkett
used
to
be
a
day
boy
head
of
ward
now
wears
specs
just
as
i
was
almost
out
of
the
wood
i
jumped
a
bush
and
landed
right
on
top
of
him
the
man
was
asleep
or
something
fancy
choosing
the
dingle
of
all
places
to
sleep
in
where
you
ca
go
a
couple
of
yards
without
running
into
a
keeper
he
had
even
the
sense
to
run
i
yelled
to
him
to
look
out
and
then
i
hooked
it
myself
and
then
the
nearest
keeper
who
just
come
down
a
buster
over
a
sailed
in
and
had
him
i
could
do
anything
of
course
there
be
a
row
about
this
the
old
man
on
to
trespassing
like
tar
i
say
think
plunkett
say
anything
about
you
being
there
too
think
so
for
one
thing
i
do
think
he
recognized
me
probably
does
know
me
by
sight
and
he
was
fast
asleep
too
no
i
fancy
i
all
right
it
was
a
jolly
narrow
shave
anything
else
happen
else
just
a
bit
that
to
say
no
nothing
much
else
no
then
said
reade
briskly
of
your
beastly
mysteries
out
with
it
here
swear
you
keep
it
dark
course
i
will
your
word
of
honour
you
think
began
reade
in
an
offended
voice
it
all
right
do
get
shirty
the
thing
is
though
it
so
frightfully
important
to
keep
it
dark
buck
up
you
need
believe
me
of
course
but
i
found
the
pots
reade
gasped
he
cried
pot
for
the
quarter
the
one
for
the
hundred
yards
both
of
them
it
a
fact
where
how
what
have
you
done
with
them
barrett
unfolded
his
tale
concisely
see
he
concluded
a
hole
i
in
i
ca
tell
the
old
man
anything
about
it
or
i
get
booked
for
cutting
and
going
out
of
bounds
and
then
while
i
waiting
and
wondering
what
to
do
and
all
that
the
thief
whoever
he
is
will
most
likely
go
off
with
the
pots
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
reade
perpended
he
said
you
can
do
is
to
lie
low
and
trust
to
luck
as
far
as
i
can
see
besides
there
one
consolation
this
plunkett
business
make
every
keeper
in
the
dingle
twice
as
keen
after
trespassers
so
the
pot
man
wo
get
a
chance
of
getting
the
things
away
there
something
in
that
admitted
barrett
all
you
can
do
said
reade
unless
i
wrote
an
anonymous
letter
to
the
old
man
explaining
things
how
would
that
do
for
you
probably
anonymous
letters
always
get
traced
to
the
person
who
wrote
them
or
pretty
nearly
always
no
you
simply
lie
low
said
barrett
will
the
process
of
concealing
one
superior
knowledge
is
very
irritating
so
irritating
indeed
that
very
few
people
do
it
barrett
however
was
obliged
to
by
necessity
he
had
a
good
chance
of
displaying
his
abilities
in
that
direction
when
he
met
grey
the
next
morning
said
grey
a
good
time
yesterday
bad
i
got
an
egg
for
you
man
what
sort
if
i
know
i
know
you
have
got
it
though
awfully
see
anything
of
the
million
keepers
them
oftener
than
i
saw
them
did
book
you
fancy
one
of
them
saw
me
but
i
got
away
all
right
the
place
pretty
lively
fair
there
long
very
thought
you
would
what
do
you
say
to
a
small
ice
there
time
before
school
are
you
flush
is
the
word
for
it
i
a
plutocrat
came
out
fairly
strong
then
to
the
tune
of
one
sovereign
cash
he
a
jolly
good
sort
my
uncle
it
seems
said
barrett
the
meeting
then
adjourned
to
the
school
shop
barrett
enjoying
his
ice
all
the
more
for
the
thought
that
his
secret
still
was
a
secret
a
thing
which
it
would
in
all
probability
have
ceased
to
be
had
he
been
rash
enough
to
confide
it
to
st
grey
who
whatever
his
other
merits
was
very
far
from
being
the
safest
sort
of
confidant
his
usual
practice
was
to
speak
first
and
to
think
if
at
all
afterwards
mr
thompson
investigates
the
pavilion
burglary
was
discussed
in
other
places
besides
study
in
the
masters
common
room
the
matter
came
in
for
its
full
share
of
comment
the
masters
were
as
at
most
schools
divided
into
the
athletic
and
and
it
was
for
the
former
class
that
the
matter
possessed
most
interest
if
it
had
been
that
apple
of
the
college
library
eye
the
original
of
st
austin
private
diary
or
even
that
lesser
treasure
the
eucalyptides
that
had
disappeared
the
elder
portion
of
the
staff
would
have
had
a
great
deal
to
say
upon
the
subject
but
apart
from
the
excitement
caused
by
the
strangeness
of
such
an
occurrence
the
theft
of
a
couple
of
sports
prizes
had
little
interest
for
them
on
the
between
these
two
castes
came
mr
thompson
the
master
of
the
sixth
form
spelt
with
a
and
no
relation
to
the
genial
james
or
the
amiable
allen
with
the
former
of
whom
indeed
he
was
on
very
indifferent
terms
of
friendship
mr
thompson
though
an
excellent
classic
had
no
knowledge
of
the
inwardness
of
the
human
boy
he
expected
every
member
of
his
form
not
only
to
be
earnest
which
very
few
members
of
a
sixth
form
are
but
also
to
communicate
his
innermost
thoughts
to
him
his
aim
was
to
be
their
confidant
the
wise
friend
to
whom
they
were
to
bring
their
troubles
and
come
for
advice
he
was
in
fact
poor
man
the
good
young
master
now
it
is
generally
the
case
at
school
that
troubles
are
things
to
be
worried
through
alone
and
any
attempt
at
interference
is
usually
resented
mr
thompson
had
asked
jim
to
tea
and
while
in
the
very
act
of
passing
him
the
muffins
had
embarked
on
a
sort
of
unofficial
sermon
winding
up
by
inviting
confidences
jim
had
naturally
been
first
flippant
and
then
rude
and
relations
had
been
strained
ever
since
must
have
been
a
professional
alleged
perkins
the
master
of
the
upper
fourth
it
had
been
for
the
fact
of
the
money
having
been
stolen
as
well
as
the
cups
i
should
have
put
it
down
to
one
of
our
fellows
dear
perkins
expostulated
merevale
dear
merevale
my
entire
form
is
capable
of
any
crime
except
the
theft
of
money
a
boy
might
have
taken
the
cups
for
a
joke
or
just
for
the
excitement
of
the
thing
meaning
to
return
them
in
time
for
the
sports
but
the
two
pounds
knocks
that
on
the
head
it
must
have
been
a
professional
always
said
that
the
pavilion
was
a
very
unsafe
place
in
which
to
keep
anything
of
value
said
mr
thompson
were
profoundly
right
thompson
replied
perkins
deserve
a
diploma
business
is
rather
in
your
line
thompson
said
merevale
must
bring
your
powers
to
bear
on
the
subject
and
scent
out
the
criminal
mr
thompson
took
a
keen
pride
in
his
powers
of
observation
he
would
frequently
observe
like
the
lamented
sherlock
holmes
the
vital
necessity
of
taking
notice
of
trifles
the
daily
life
of
a
sixth
form
master
at
a
big
public
school
does
not
afford
much
scope
for
the
practice
of
the
detective
art
but
mr
thompson
had
once
detected
a
piece
of
cribbing
when
correcting
some
latin
proses
for
the
master
of
the
lower
third
solely
by
the
exercise
of
his
powers
of
observation
and
he
had
never
forgotten
it
he
burned
to
add
another
scalp
to
his
collection
and
this
pavilion
burglary
seemed
peculiarly
suited
to
his
talents
he
had
given
the
matter
his
attention
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
everything
pointed
to
the
fact
that
skilled
hands
had
been
at
work
from
eleven
until
twelve
that
day
the
sixth
were
doing
an
unseen
examination
under
the
eye
of
the
headmaster
and
mr
thompson
was
consequently
off
duty
he
took
advantage
of
this
to
stroll
down
to
the
pavilion
and
make
a
personal
inspection
of
the
first
room
from
which
what
were
left
of
the
prizes
had
long
been
removed
to
a
place
of
safety
he
was
making
his
way
to
the
place
where
the
was
usually
to
be
found
with
a
view
to
obtaining
the
keys
when
he
noticed
that
the
door
was
already
open
and
on
going
thither
he
came
upon
biffen
the
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
stranger
sir
said
the
he
was
on
speaking
terms
with
most
of
the
masters
and
all
the
boys
then
to
his
companion
is
mr
thompson
one
of
our
masters
sir
said
the
latter
keeps
up
i
am
inspector
roberts
scotland
yard
but
i
think
we
in
for
rain
soon
yes
so
been
asked
to
look
into
this
business
mr
thompson
queer
business
might
i
ask
i
am
very
interested
in
this
kind
of
thing
whether
you
have
arrived
at
any
conclusions
yet
the
detective
eyed
him
thoughtfully
as
if
he
were
hunting
for
the
answer
to
a
riddle
not
yet
nothing
definite
presume
you
take
it
for
granted
it
was
the
work
of
a
professional
burglar
no
take
nothing
for
granted
great
mistake
prejudices
one
way
or
other
great
mistake
but
i
think
yes
i
think
it
was
probably
almost
certainly
done
by
a
professional
mr
thompson
looked
rather
blank
at
this
it
shook
his
confidence
in
his
powers
of
deduction
he
expostulated
no
one
but
a
practised
burglar
would
have
taken
a
pane
of
glass
out
so
ah
neatly
inspector
roberts
rubbed
a
finger
thoughtfully
round
the
place
where
the
glass
had
been
then
he
withdrew
it
and
showed
a
small
cut
from
which
the
blood
was
beginning
to
drip
you
notice
anything
peculiar
about
that
cut
he
enquired
mr
thompson
did
not
nor
did
the
carefully
now
do
you
see
no
well
it
not
a
clean
cut
ragged
very
ragged
now
if
a
professional
had
cut
that
pane
out
he
would
have
left
it
jagged
like
that
no
he
would
have
used
a
diamond
done
the
job
neatly
this
destroyed
another
of
mr
thompson
premises
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
a
diamond
had
been
used
he
said
that
pane
not
cut
by
a
diamond
what
did
the
burglar
use
then
no
diamond
diamond
would
have
left
smooth
surface
smooth
as
a
razor
edge
this
is
like
a
saw
amateurish
work
ca
say
for
certain
but
probably
done
with
a
chisel
a
chisel
surely
not
probably
with
a
chisel
probably
the
man
knocked
the
pane
out
with
one
blow
then
removed
all
the
glass
so
as
to
make
it
look
like
the
work
of
an
old
hand
very
good
idea
but
amateurish
i
am
told
that
three
cups
have
been
taken
could
you
tell
me
how
long
they
had
been
in
the
pavilion
mr
thompson
considered
he
said
course
it
difficult
to
remember
exactly
but
i
think
they
were
placed
there
soon
after
one
the
day
before
yesterday
and
the
robbery
took
place
yesterday
in
the
early
morning
or
the
night
before
the
pavilion
the
usual
place
to
keep
the
prizes
for
the
sports
it
is
not
they
were
only
put
there
temporarily
the
board
room
where
they
are
usually
kept
and
which
is
in
the
main
buildings
of
the
school
happened
to
be
needed
until
the
next
day
most
of
us
were
very
much
against
leaving
them
in
the
pavilion
but
it
was
thought
that
no
harm
could
come
to
them
if
they
were
removed
next
day
they
were
removed
that
night
which
made
a
great
difference
said
mr
roberts
chuckling
at
his
mild
joke
see
then
i
suppose
none
outside
the
school
knew
that
they
were
not
in
their
proper
place
imagine
not
so
knocks
the
idea
of
professional
work
on
the
head
none
of
the
regular
trade
can
have
known
this
room
held
so
much
silver
for
one
night
no
regular
would
look
twice
at
a
cricket
pavilion
under
ordinary
circumstances
therefore
it
must
have
been
somebody
who
had
something
to
do
with
the
school
one
of
the
boys
perhaps
i
do
not
think
that
probable
ca
tell
never
does
to
form
hasty
conclusions
boy
might
have
done
it
for
many
reasons
some
boys
would
have
done
it
for
the
sake
of
the
excitement
that
perhaps
is
the
least
possible
explanation
but
you
get
boy
kleptomaniacs
just
as
much
in
proportion
as
kleptomaniacs
i
knew
a
man
had
a
son
could
keep
him
away
from
anything
valuable
had
to
take
him
away
in
a
hurry
from
three
schools
good
schools
too
what
became
of
him
he
did
not
come
to
us
i
suppose
somebody
advised
the
father
to
send
him
to
one
of
those
schools
where
they
flog
great
success
stole
some
money
got
flogged
instead
of
expelled
did
it
again
with
same
result
gradually
got
tired
of
it
reformed
character
now
i
do
say
it
is
a
boy
mind
you
most
probably
not
only
say
it
may
be
all
the
while
he
was
talking
his
eyes
were
moving
restlessly
round
the
room
he
came
to
the
window
through
which
jim
had
effected
his
entrance
and
paused
before
the
broken
pane
suppose
he
tried
that
window
first
before
going
round
to
the
other
hazarded
mr
thompson
most
probably
broke
it
and
then
remembered
that
anyone
at
the
windows
of
the
boarding
houses
might
see
him
so
left
his
job
half
done
and
shifted
his
point
of
action
i
think
so
yes
he
moved
on
again
till
he
came
to
the
other
window
then
he
gave
vent
to
an
excited
exclamation
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
caked
mud
from
the
sill
as
carefully
as
if
it
were
some
fragile
treasure
see
this
he
said
was
wet
when
the
robbery
was
done
the
man
brought
it
in
with
him
on
his
boot
left
it
on
the
sill
as
he
climbed
in
got
out
in
a
hurry
startled
by
something
you
can
see
he
was
startled
and
left
in
a
hurry
from
the
different
values
of
the
cups
he
took
and
as
he
was
going
put
his
hand
on
this
left
a
clear
impression
good
as
plaster
of
paris
very
nearly
mr
thompson
looked
at
the
piece
of
mud
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
distinct
imprint
of
the
palm
of
a
hand
he
could
see
the
larger
of
the
lines
quite
clearly
and
under
a
there
was
no
doubt
that
more
could
be
revealed
he
drew
in
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
and
excitement
said
the
detective
piece
of
mud
could
prove
anything
by
itself
but
bring
it
up
at
the
end
of
a
long
string
of
evidence
and
if
it
fits
your
man
it
convicts
him
as
much
as
a
photograph
would
morning
sir
i
must
be
going
and
he
retired
carrying
the
piece
of
mud
in
his
hand
leaving
mr
thompson
in
the
full
grip
of
the
hunting
with
might
and
main
for
more
clues
after
some
time
however
he
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
give
up
the
search
for
the
bell
rang
for
dinner
and
he
always
lunched
as
did
many
of
the
masters
in
the
great
hall
during
the
course
of
the
meal
he
exercised
his
brains
without
pause
in
the
effort
to
discover
a
fitting
suspect
did
he
know
of
any
victim
of
kleptomania
in
the
school
no
he
was
sorry
to
say
he
did
not
was
anybody
in
urgent
need
of
money
he
could
not
say
very
probably
yes
but
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
after
lunch
he
went
back
to
the
common
room
there
was
a
letter
lying
on
the
table
he
picked
it
up
it
was
addressed
to
thomson
st
austin
now
mr
thompson
christian
name
was
john
he
did
not
notice
the
omission
of
the
until
he
had
opened
the
envelope
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
contents
the
letter
was
so
short
that
only
a
glimpse
was
needed
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
read
the
whole
that
he
realized
that
it
was
somebody
else
letter
that
he
had
opened
this
was
the
letter
jim
frantic
haste
can
you
let
me
have
that
two
pounds
directly
you
come
back
beg
borrow
or
steal
it
i
simply
must
have
yours
ever
allen
the
sports
sports
weather
at
st
austin
was
as
a
rule
a
quaint
but
unpleasant
solution
of
mud
hail
and
iced
rain
these
were
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
school
counted
it
as
something
gained
when
they
were
spared
the
usual
cutting
east
wind
this
year
however
occurred
that
invaluable
exception
which
is
so
useful
in
proving
rules
there
was
no
gale
only
a
gentle
breeze
the
sun
was
positively
shining
and
there
was
a
general
freshness
in
the
air
which
would
have
made
a
cripple
cast
away
his
crutches
and
after
backing
himself
heavily
both
ways
enter
for
the
strangers
hundred
yards
jim
had
wandered
off
alone
he
was
feeling
too
nervous
at
the
thought
of
the
coming
mile
and
all
it
meant
to
him
to
move
in
society
for
the
present
charteris
welch
and
tony
going
out
shortly
before
lunch
to
inspect
the
track
found
him
already
on
the
spot
and
in
a
very
low
state
of
mind
you
chaps
he
said
dejectedly
as
they
came
up
james
is
preoccupied
said
charteris
this
jaundiced
air
jim
look
at
our
other
thompson
over
there
other
thompson
was
at
that
moment
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
headmaster
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
field
at
him
said
charteris
away
as
merrily
as
a
little
to
the
old
man
you
should
take
a
lesson
from
him
here
i
say
said
jim
after
a
pause
believe
something
jolly
queer
up
between
thompson
and
the
old
man
and
i
believe
it
about
me
on
earth
makes
you
think
that
asked
welch
his
evil
conscience
said
charteris
one
who
committed
the
awful
crime
that
jim
has
could
pay
the
least
attention
to
anything
thompson
said
what
does
our
friend
thucydides
remark
on
the
subject
mens
recti
nec
si
sinit
esse
dolorem
sed
revocare
very
well
then
why
should
you
think
anything
up
asked
tony
nothing
is
but
it
jolly
fishy
you
see
thompson
and
the
old
pacing
along
there
well
they
been
going
like
that
for
about
twenty
minutes
i
been
watching
them
you
ca
tell
they
talking
about
you
you
rotter
said
tony
all
you
know
they
may
be
discussing
the
exams
why
the
sea
is
boiling
hot
and
whether
pigs
have
wings
put
in
charteris
anything
added
welch
profoundly
all
i
know
is
that
thompson
been
doing
all
the
talking
and
the
old
man
been
getting
more
and
more
riled
thompson
been
demanding
a
rise
of
screw
or
asking
for
a
small
loan
or
something
said
charteris
long
have
you
been
watching
them
twenty
minutes
here
did
you
go
and
join
them
there
nothing
like
tact
if
you
were
to
go
and
ask
the
old
man
why
the
whale
wailed
or
something
after
that
style
it
buck
him
up
like
a
tonic
i
wish
you
would
and
then
you
could
tell
him
to
tell
you
all
about
it
and
see
if
you
could
do
something
to
smooth
the
wrinkles
from
his
careworn
brow
and
let
the
sunshine
of
happiness
into
his
heart
he
like
it
awfully
he
said
jim
grimly
i
got
the
chance
just
now
thompson
said
something
to
him
and
he
spun
round
saw
me
and
shouted
thomson
i
went
up
and
capped
him
and
he
was
starting
to
say
something
when
he
seemed
to
change
his
mind
and
instead
of
confessing
everything
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
said
no
no
thomson
go
away
it
nothing
i
will
send
for
you
later
did
you
knock
him
down
asked
charteris
happened
said
welch
gave
me
a
shove
as
if
he
were
putting
the
weight
and
said
again
it
no
matter
go
away
thomson
now
so
i
went
you
kept
an
eye
on
him
ever
since
said
charteris
he
seem
at
all
restive
do
think
he
noticed
me
thompson
had
the
floor
and
he
was
pretty
well
full
up
listening
to
him
suppose
you
do
know
what
it
all
about
asked
tony
be
this
pavilion
business
my
dear
sweet
cherub
said
charteris
you
go
and
make
an
utter
idiot
of
yourself
and
think
you
found
out
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
even
if
they
suspect
you
they
got
to
prove
it
there
no
sense
in
your
giving
them
a
helping
hand
in
the
business
what
got
to
do
is
to
look
normal
do
overdo
it
or
you
look
like
a
swashbuckler
and
that
be
worse
than
underdoing
it
ca
you
make
yourself
look
less
like
a
convicted
forger
for
my
sake
really
do
look
a
bit
off
it
said
welch
critically
if
you
were
sickening
for
the
or
something
does
he
tony
said
that
expert
in
symptoms
simply
must
buck
up
jim
or
drake
walk
away
from
you
disappointing
said
charteris
find
a
chap
who
can
crack
a
crib
as
neatly
as
you
can
doubling
up
like
this
think
how
charles
peace
would
have
behaved
under
the
circs
do
disgrace
him
poor
man
said
jim
with
an
attempt
at
optimism
is
as
if
actually
done
anything
is
it
so
said
charteris
what
i
been
trying
to
get
you
to
see
all
along
keep
that
fact
steadily
before
you
and
you
be
all
right
goes
the
said
tony
can
always
tell
bell
in
a
crowd
william
rings
it
as
if
he
was
doing
it
for
his
health
william
also
known
in
criminal
circles
as
the
moke
was
the
gentleman
who
served
the
house
in
a
perpetual
grin
and
a
suit
of
livery
four
sizes
too
large
for
him
as
a
sort
of
butler
an
artist
agreed
charteris
as
he
listened
to
the
performance
it
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
does
he
well
if
we
do
want
to
spoil
merevale
appetite
by
coming
in
at
we
might
be
moving
they
moved
accordingly
the
sports
were
to
begin
at
two
with
a
series
of
races
which
commenced
with
the
twelve
cameron
of
prater
a
warm
man
for
this
said
those
who
had
means
of
knowing
and
culminated
at
about
a
quarter
past
with
the
open
event
for
which
welch
was
a
certainty
by
a
quarter
to
the
hour
the
places
round
the
ropes
were
filled
and
more
visitors
were
constantly
streaming
in
at
the
two
entrances
to
the
school
grounds
while
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
the
band
of
the
local
police
force
the
military
being
unavailable
owing
to
exigencies
of
distance
were
seating
themselves
with
the
grim
determination
of
those
who
know
that
they
are
going
to
play
the
soldiers
chorus
out
of
the
band
at
the
sports
had
played
the
soldiers
chorus
out
of
every
year
for
decades
past
and
will
in
all
probability
play
it
for
decades
to
come
the
sports
at
st
austin
were
always
looked
forward
to
by
everyone
with
the
keenest
interest
and
when
the
day
arrived
were
as
regularly
voted
slow
in
all
school
sports
there
are
too
many
foregone
conclusions
in
the
present
instance
everybody
knew
and
none
better
than
the
competitors
themselves
that
welch
would
win
the
quarter
and
hundred
the
high
jump
was
an
equal
certainty
for
a
boy
named
reece
in
halliday
house
jackson
unless
he
were
quite
out
of
form
would
win
the
long
jump
and
the
majority
of
the
other
events
had
already
been
decided
the
gem
of
the
afternoon
would
be
the
mile
for
not
even
the
shrewdest
judge
of
form
could
say
whether
jim
would
beat
drake
or
drake
jim
both
had
done
equally
good
times
in
practice
and
both
were
known
to
be
in
the
best
of
training
the
adherents
of
jim
pointed
to
the
fact
that
he
had
won
the
half
off
drake
by
a
narrow
margin
true
but
still
he
had
won
it
the
other
side
argued
that
a
is
no
criterion
for
a
mile
and
that
if
drake
had
timed
his
sprint
better
he
would
probably
have
won
for
he
had
finished
up
far
more
strongly
than
his
opponent
and
so
on
the
subject
of
the
mile
public
opinion
was
for
once
divided
the
field
was
nearly
full
by
this
time
the
only
clear
space
outside
the
ropes
was
where
the
headmaster
stood
to
greet
and
talk
about
the
weather
to
such
parents
and
guardians
and
other
celebrities
as
might
pass
this
habit
of
his
did
not
greatly
affect
the
unattached
members
of
the
school
those
whose
parents
lived
in
distant
parts
of
the
world
and
were
not
present
on
sports
day
but
to
st
jones
brown
for
instance
of
the
lower
third
towing
mr
brown
senior
round
the
ring
it
was
a
nervous
ordeal
to
have
to
stand
by
while
his
father
and
the
head
exchanged
polite
commonplaces
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
there
was
a
horrible
thought
that
the
head
searching
for
something
to
say
might
seize
upon
that
little
matter
of
broken
bounds
or
shaky
examination
papers
as
a
subject
for
discussion
he
was
generally
obliged
when
the
interview
was
over
to
conduct
his
parent
to
the
shop
by
way
of
pulling
his
system
together
again
the
latter
of
course
paying
at
intervals
round
the
ropes
old
austinian
number
one
was
meeting
old
austinian
number
two
whom
he
emphatically
detested
and
had
hoped
to
avoid
and
was
conversing
with
him
in
a
nervous
manner
the
clearness
of
his
replies
being
greatly
handicapped
by
a
feeling
which
grew
with
the
minutes
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
get
rid
of
him
and
go
in
search
of
old
austinian
number
three
his
bosom
friend
at
other
intervals
present
austinians
of
tender
years
were
manoeuvring
of
sisters
aunts
and
mothers
and
trying
without
much
success
to
pretend
that
they
did
not
belong
to
them
a
pretence
which
came
down
heavily
when
one
of
the
aunts
addressed
them
as
or
and
wanted
to
know
audibly
if
boy
who
had
just
one
person
in
the
school
whom
they
happened
to
hate
and
despise
was
their
best
friend
it
was
a
little
trying
too
to
have
to
explain
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
that
the
reason
why
you
were
not
running
in
race
the
thirteen
hundred
by
jove
which
ought
to
have
been
a
gift
to
you
only
etc
was
because
you
had
been
ignominiously
knocked
out
in
the
trial
heats
in
short
the
afternoon
wore
on
welch
won
the
hundred
by
two
yards
and
the
quarter
by
twenty
and
the
other
events
fell
in
nearly
every
case
to
the
favourite
the
hurdles
created
something
of
a
surprise
jackson
who
ought
to
have
won
coming
down
over
the
last
hurdle
but
two
thereby
enabling
dallas
to
pull
off
an
unexpected
victory
by
a
couple
of
yards
vaughan
enthusiastic
watch
made
the
time
a
little
under
sixteen
seconds
but
the
official
timekeeper
had
other
views
there
were
no
instances
of
the
timid
new
boy
at
whom
previously
the
world
had
scoffed
walking
away
with
the
most
important
race
of
the
day
and
then
the
spectators
were
roused
from
a
state
of
coma
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
ringing
for
the
mile
old
austinian
number
one
gratefully
seized
the
opportunity
to
escape
from
old
austinian
number
two
and
lose
himself
in
the
crowd
young
with
equal
gratitude
left
his
father
talking
to
the
head
and
shot
off
without
ceremony
to
get
a
good
place
at
the
ropes
in
fact
there
was
a
general
stir
of
anticipation
and
all
round
the
ring
paterfamilias
was
asking
his
son
and
heir
which
was
drake
and
which
thomson
and
settling
his
glasses
more
firmly
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
the
staff
of
glow
conducted
jim
to
the
and
did
their
best
to
relieve
his
obvious
nervousness
with
light
conversation
old
chap
said
jim
he
had
been
saying
to
everything
throughout
the
afternoon
said
is
my
hat
on
straight
and
does
it
suit
the
colour
of
my
eyes
said
charteris
yes
yes
rather
ripping
in
a
voice
have
you
a
theory
of
the
universe
old
chap
said
did
you
want
your
legs
rubbed
before
you
start
i
believe
it
an
excellent
specific
for
the
gout
what
no
i
do
think
so
thanks
you
write
to
us
sometimes
jim
and
give
my
love
to
little
henry
and
wear
flannel
next
your
skin
my
dear
boy
said
charteris
this
seemed
to
strike
even
jim
as
irrelevant
shut
up
for
goodness
sake
alderman
he
said
irritably
ca
you
go
and
rag
somebody
else
place
is
by
your
side
go
my
son
or
else
they
be
starting
without
you
give
us
your
blazer
and
take
my
tip
the
tip
of
an
old
runner
and
do
pocket
your
opponent
ball
in
your
own
and
come
back
victorious
or
on
the
shields
of
your
soldiers
all
right
sir
to
the
starter
he
just
making
his
will
jim
buck
up
or
i
lynch
you
after
the
race
jim
answered
by
muffling
him
in
his
blazer
and
walking
to
the
line
there
were
six
competitors
in
all
each
of
whom
owned
a
name
ranking
alphabetically
higher
than
thomson
jim
therefore
had
the
outside
berth
drake
had
the
one
next
to
the
inside
which
fell
to
adamson
the
victim
of
the
lost
two
pounds
episode
both
drake
and
jim
got
off
well
at
the
sound
of
the
pistol
and
the
pace
was
warm
from
the
start
jim
evidently
had
his
eye
on
the
inside
berth
and
after
half
a
lap
had
been
completed
he
got
it
drake
falling
back
jim
continued
to
make
the
running
and
led
at
the
end
of
the
first
lap
by
about
five
yards
then
came
adamson
followed
by
a
batch
of
three
and
finally
drake
taking
things
exceedingly
coolly
a
couple
of
yards
behind
them
the
distance
separating
him
from
jim
was
little
over
a
dozen
yards
a
roar
of
applause
greeted
the
runners
as
they
started
on
the
second
lap
and
it
was
significant
that
while
supporters
shouted
run
those
of
drake
were
fain
to
substitute
advice
for
approval
and
cry
it
drake
however
had
not
the
least
intention
of
it
in
the
generally
accepted
meaning
of
the
phrase
a
yard
or
two
to
the
rear
meant
nothing
in
the
first
lap
and
he
was
running
quite
well
enough
to
satisfy
himself
with
a
nice
springy
stride
which
he
hoped
would
begin
to
tell
soon
with
the
end
of
the
second
lap
the
real
business
of
the
race
began
for
the
survival
of
the
fittest
had
resulted
in
eliminations
and
changes
of
order
jim
still
led
but
now
by
only
eight
or
nine
yards
drake
had
come
up
to
second
and
adamson
had
dropped
to
a
bad
third
two
of
the
runners
had
given
the
race
up
and
retired
and
the
last
man
was
a
long
way
behind
and
to
all
practical
purposes
out
of
the
running
there
were
only
three
laps
and
as
the
last
lap
began
the
pace
quickened
fast
as
it
had
been
before
jim
was
exerting
every
particle
of
his
strength
he
was
not
a
runner
who
depended
overmuch
on
his
final
dash
he
hoped
to
gain
so
much
ground
before
drake
made
his
sprint
as
to
neutralize
it
when
it
came
adamson
he
did
not
fear
and
now
they
were
in
the
last
two
hundred
yards
jim
by
this
time
some
thirty
yards
ahead
but
in
great
straits
drake
had
quickened
his
pace
and
gained
slowly
on
him
as
they
rounded
the
corner
and
came
into
the
straight
the
cheers
were
redoubled
it
was
a
great
race
then
fifty
yards
from
the
tape
drake
began
his
final
sprint
if
he
had
saved
himself
before
he
made
up
for
it
now
the
gap
dwindled
and
dwindled
neither
could
improve
his
pace
it
was
a
question
whether
there
was
enough
of
the
race
left
for
drake
to
catch
his
man
or
whether
he
had
once
more
left
his
sprint
till
too
late
jim
could
hear
the
roars
of
the
spectators
and
the
frenzied
appeals
of
merevale
house
to
him
to
sprint
but
he
was
already
doing
his
utmost
everything
seemed
black
to
him
a
black
surging
mist
and
in
its
centre
a
thin
white
line
the
tape
could
he
reach
it
before
drake
or
would
he
collapse
before
he
reached
it
there
were
only
five
more
yards
to
go
now
and
still
he
led
four
three
two
then
something
white
swept
past
him
on
the
right
the
white
line
quivered
snapped
and
vanished
and
he
pitched
blindly
forward
on
to
the
turf
at
the
drake
had
won
by
a
foot
an
interesting
interview
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
jim
had
a
wretched
time
to
be
beaten
after
such
a
race
by
a
foot
and
to
be
beaten
by
a
foot
when
victory
would
have
cut
the
gordian
knot
of
his
difficulties
once
and
for
all
was
enough
to
embitter
anybody
existence
he
found
it
hard
to
accept
the
condolences
of
casual
acquaintances
and
still
harder
to
do
the
right
thing
and
congratulate
drake
on
his
victory
a
refinement
of
which
is
by
custom
expected
of
the
vanquished
in
every
branch
of
work
or
sport
but
he
managed
it
somehow
and
he
also
managed
to
appear
reasonably
gratified
when
he
went
up
to
take
his
prize
for
the
tony
and
the
others
who
knew
what
his
defeat
meant
to
him
kept
out
of
his
way
for
which
he
was
grateful
after
however
it
was
a
different
matter
but
by
that
time
he
was
more
ready
for
society
even
now
there
might
be
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
he
asked
tony
advice
on
the
subject
tony
was
perplexed
the
situation
was
beyond
his
grip
do
see
what
you
can
do
jim
he
said
the
rugby
be
satisfied
with
a
pound
on
account
it
a
beastly
business
do
you
think
your
pater
will
give
you
your
money
all
the
same
as
it
was
such
a
close
finish
jim
thought
not
in
fact
he
was
certain
that
he
would
not
and
tony
relapsed
into
silence
as
he
tried
to
bring
another
idea
to
the
surface
he
had
not
succeeded
when
charteris
came
in
he
said
have
my
sympathy
it
was
an
awfully
near
thing
but
i
got
something
more
solid
than
sympathy
i
will
take
a
seat
rag
charteris
said
tony
much
too
serious
ragging
you
rotter
i
say
i
have
something
more
solid
than
sympathy
and
instead
of
giving
me
an
opening
as
a
decent
individual
would
by
saying
what
you
accuse
me
of
ragging
james
my
son
if
you
will
postpone
your
suicide
for
two
minutes
i
will
a
tale
unfold
i
have
an
idea
more
like
it
now
you
talking
we
will
start
at
the
beginning
first
you
want
a
pound
so
do
secondly
you
want
it
before
next
tuesday
thirdly
you
have
it
on
you
how
therefore
are
you
to
get
it
as
the
song
hath
it
you
do
know
they
know
but
now
we
come
to
the
point
i
know
said
jim
and
tony
together
is
a
luminous
idea
why
should
we
publish
a
special
number
of
glow
before
the
end
of
term
jim
was
silent
at
the
brilliance
of
the
scheme
then
doubts
began
to
harass
him
there
time
yards
of
it
this
is
saturday
we
start
tonight
and
keep
at
it
all
night
if
necessary
we
ought
to
manage
it
easily
before
tomorrow
morning
on
sunday
we
jellygraph
it
it
have
to
be
a
jellygraphed
number
this
time
on
monday
and
tuesday
we
sell
it
and
there
you
are
are
you
going
to
sell
it
in
the
ordinary
way
at
the
shop
i
arranged
all
that
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
write
the
thing
as
the
penalty
for
your
sins
you
shall
take
on
most
of
it
do
the
editorial
welch
is
pegging
away
at
the
sports
account
now
and
i
waylaid
jackson
just
before
and
induced
him
by
awful
threats
to
knock
off
some
verses
so
we
practically
published
already
grand
said
jim
it
awfully
decent
of
you
chaps
to
fag
yourselves
like
this
for
me
i
start
on
something
now
can
you
raise
a
sovereign
on
one
number
asked
tony
that
or
i
arranged
with
the
shop
to
give
us
a
quid
down
and
take
all
profits
on
this
and
the
next
number
they
as
keen
as
anything
on
the
idea
but
i
kept
that
back
to
be
used
only
in
case
of
necessity
but
the
point
is
that
jim
gets
his
sovereign
in
any
case
i
must
be
off
to
my
editorial
so
long
and
he
went
man
charteris
said
tony
as
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
in
search
of
a
subject
better
weigh
in
with
an
account
of
the
burglary
it
a
pity
you
ca
give
the
realistic
description
you
gave
us
it
would
sell
like
anything
do
to
risk
it
at
that
moment
the
door
swung
violently
open
with
merevale
holding
on
to
the
handle
and
following
it
in
its
course
merevale
very
rarely
knocked
at
a
study
door
a
peculiarity
of
his
which
went
far
towards
shattering
the
nervous
systems
of
the
various
inmates
who
never
knew
when
it
was
safe
to
stop
work
and
read
fiction
thomson
he
said
was
looking
for
you
the
headmaster
wants
to
see
you
over
at
his
house
if
you
are
feeling
well
enough
after
your
exertions
close
thing
that
mile
i
do
know
when
i
have
seen
a
race
on
the
college
grounds
i
suppose
you
are
feeling
pretty
tired
eh
am
rather
sir
but
i
had
better
see
the
head
will
he
be
in
his
study
sir
i
think
so
jim
took
his
cap
and
went
off
while
merevale
settled
down
to
spend
the
evening
in
tony
study
as
he
often
did
when
the
term
work
was
over
and
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
keep
up
the
pretence
of
preparation
parker
the
head
butler
conducted
jim
into
the
presence
down
thomson
said
the
head
jim
took
a
seat
and
he
had
just
time
to
notice
that
his
namesake
mr
thompson
was
also
present
and
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
tie
had
crept
up
to
the
top
of
his
collar
he
was
looking
quite
unnecessarily
satisfied
with
himself
when
he
became
aware
that
the
head
was
speaking
to
him
hope
you
are
not
feeling
any
bad
effects
from
your
race
thomson
jim
was
half
inclined
to
say
that
his
effects
were
but
he
felt
that
the
quip
was
too
subtle
and
would
be
lost
on
his
present
audience
so
he
merely
said
that
he
was
not
there
was
a
rather
awkward
silence
for
a
minute
then
the
head
coughed
and
said
sir
think
it
would
be
fairest
to
you
to
come
to
the
point
at
once
and
to
tell
you
the
reason
why
i
wished
to
see
you
jim
ran
over
the
sins
which
shot
up
in
his
mind
like
rockets
as
he
heard
these
ominous
words
and
he
knew
that
this
must
be
the
matter
of
the
pavilion
he
was
therefore
in
a
measure
prepared
for
the
next
words
very
serious
charge
has
been
brought
against
you
you
are
accused
of
nothing
less
than
this
unfortunate
burglary
of
the
prizes
for
the
sports
sir
is
my
accuser
mr
thompson
the
headmaster
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
mr
thompson
spoke
is
so
he
said
said
the
head
accusation
is
brought
by
mr
thompson
sir
said
jim
again
and
this
time
the
observation
was
intended
to
convey
the
meaning
dear
good
sir
when
you
known
him
as
long
as
i
have
you
wo
mind
what
mr
thompson
says
or
does
it
a
kind
of
way
he
got
and
if
he
not
under
treatment
for
it
he
ought
to
be
should
like
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
that
the
charge
is
groundless
to
oblige
thought
jim
then
aloud
sir
say
it
is
groundless
this
from
mr
thompson
sir
must
warn
you
thomson
that
the
evidence
against
you
is
very
strong
indeed
said
the
head
suggesting
that
you
are
guilty
of
this
thing
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
if
you
have
any
confession
to
make
it
will
be
greatly
very
greatly
to
your
own
advantage
to
make
it
at
once
give
myself
away
free
gratis
and
for
nothing
thought
jim
for
me
thank
you
i
hear
mr
thompson
evidence
sir
he
asked
thomson
he
effected
a
movement
in
mr
direction
midway
between
a
bow
and
a
nod
mr
thompson
coughed
jim
coughed
too
in
the
same
key
this
put
mr
thompson
out
and
he
had
to
cough
again
the
first
place
he
began
has
been
conclusively
proved
that
the
burglary
was
the
work
of
an
unskilful
hand
certainly
seems
to
point
to
me
as
the
author
said
jim
flippantly
thomson
said
the
head
and
counsel
for
the
prosecution
resumed
the
second
place
it
has
been
proved
that
you
were
at
the
time
of
the
burglary
in
great
need
of
money
this
woke
jim
up
it
destroyed
that
feeling
of
coolness
with
which
he
had
started
the
interview
awful
thoughts
flashed
across
his
mind
had
he
been
seen
at
the
time
of
his
burglarious
entry
at
any
rate
how
did
mr
thompson
come
to
know
of
his
pecuniary
troubles
you
say
it
had
been
proved
sir
sir
he
felt
the
question
was
a
mistake
as
he
was
uttering
it
your
really
injured
innocent
would
have
called
all
the
elements
to
witness
that
he
was
a
millionaire
but
it
was
too
late
to
try
that
now
and
besides
he
really
did
want
to
know
how
mr
thompson
had
got
to
hear
of
this
skeleton
in
his
cupboard
the
headmaster
interrupted
hurriedly
is
a
very
unfortunate
affair
altogether
and
this
is
quite
the
most
unfortunate
part
a
letter
came
to
the
college
addressed
to
thomson
and
mr
thompson
opened
and
read
it
inadvertently
quite
inadvertently
sir
said
jim
in
a
tone
which
implied
am
no
george
washington
myself
but
when
you
say
he
read
it
inadvertently
well
letter
was
signed
allen
brother
sir
and
it
asked
for
two
pounds
evidently
in
payment
of
a
debt
and
the
tone
of
the
letter
certainly
seemed
to
show
that
you
were
not
then
in
possession
of
the
money
i
have
the
letter
sir
then
with
respectful
venom
to
mr
thompson
you
have
finished
with
it
the
letter
was
handed
over
and
pocketed
and
jim
braced
his
moral
pecker
up
for
the
next
round
of
the
contest
take
it
then
thomson
resumed
the
head
you
owe
your
brother
this
money
sir
pounds
is
a
great
deal
of
money
for
one
boy
to
lend
another
was
not
lent
sir
it
was
a
bet
bet
in
a
nasty
tone
from
the
head
bet
in
a
sepulchral
echo
from
mr
thompson
there
was
a
long
pause
any
other
time
said
the
head
should
feel
it
my
duty
to
take
serious
notice
of
this
but
beside
this
other
matter
with
which
you
are
charged
it
becomes
trivial
i
can
only
repeat
that
the
circumstances
are
exceedingly
suspicious
and
i
think
it
would
be
in
your
interests
to
tell
us
all
you
know
without
further
delay
take
it
for
granted
i
am
guilty
sir
began
jim
hotly
say
that
the
circumstances
seems
to
point
to
it
in
the
first
place
you
were
in
need
of
money
you
admit
that
sir
the
second
place
said
the
head
slowly
the
second
place
i
am
told
that
you
were
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
house
at
eight
on
the
night
of
the
burglary
when
you
ought
certainly
to
have
been
in
your
study
at
your
work
bombshell
number
two
and
a
worse
one
than
the
first
for
the
moment
jim
head
swam
if
he
had
been
asked
just
then
in
so
many
words
where
he
had
been
at
that
time
it
is
likely
that
he
would
have
admitted
everything
by
some
miracle
the
head
did
not
press
his
point
may
go
now
thomson
he
said
should
like
to
see
you
after
morning
school
on
monday
sir
said
jim
and
went
without
another
word
coming
so
soon
after
the
exertion
and
strain
of
the
mile
this
shock
made
him
feel
sick
and
dizzy
when
he
had
gone
the
head
turned
to
mr
thompson
with
a
worried
look
on
his
face
feel
as
certain
as
i
do
of
anything
he
said
thoughtfully
that
boy
is
telling
the
truth
if
he
had
been
guilty
he
would
not
have
behaved
like
that
i
feel
sure
of
it
mr
thompson
looked
equally
thoughtful
circumstances
are
certainly
very
suspicious
he
said
echoing
the
head
own
words
wish
i
could
think
he
was
innocent
but
i
am
bound
to
say
i
do
not
i
regard
the
evidence
as
conclusive
evidence
is
proverbially
uncertain
mr
thompson
that
is
principally
the
reason
why
i
was
so
bent
on
making
him
confess
if
he
had
anything
to
confess
i
ca
expel
a
boy
and
ruin
his
whole
career
on
mere
suspicion
the
matter
must
be
proved
doubly
proved
and
even
then
i
should
feel
uneasy
until
he
owned
himself
guilty
it
is
a
most
unpleasant
affair
a
terrible
affair
agreed
mr
thompson
and
exactly
the
same
thing
was
occurring
at
that
moment
to
jim
as
he
sat
on
his
bed
in
his
dormitory
and
pondered
hopelessly
on
this
new
complication
that
had
presented
itself
so
unexpectedly
he
was
getting
very
near
to
the
end
of
his
tether
was
thomson
of
merevale
it
seemed
to
him
indeed
that
he
had
reached
it
already
possibly
if
he
had
had
a
clearer
conscience
and
a
larger
experience
he
might
have
recognized
that
the
evidence
which
mr
thompson
had
described
as
conclusive
was
in
reality
not
strong
enough
to
hang
a
cat
on
unfortunately
he
did
not
enjoy
those
advantages
sir
alfred
scores
soon
after
jim
had
taken
his
departure
mr
thompson
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
in
case
the
headmaster
had
anything
more
to
say
drifted
silently
out
of
the
room
the
head
like
the
gentleman
in
the
ballad
continued
to
wear
a
worried
look
the
more
he
examined
the
matter
the
less
did
he
know
what
to
make
of
it
he
believed
as
he
had
said
to
mr
thompson
that
jim
was
entirely
innocent
it
was
an
incredible
thing
he
thought
that
a
public
school
boy
a
too
into
the
bargain
should
break
out
of
his
house
and
into
a
cricket
pavilion
however
great
a
crisis
his
finances
might
be
undergoing
and
then
to
steal
two
of
the
prizes
for
the
sports
impossible
against
this
however
must
be
placed
the
theft
of
the
two
pounds
it
might
occur
to
a
boy
as
indeed
mr
thompson
had
suggested
to
steal
the
cups
in
order
to
give
the
impression
that
a
practised
burglar
had
been
at
work
there
was
certainly
something
to
be
said
in
favour
of
this
view
but
he
would
never
believe
such
a
thing
he
was
a
good
judge
of
character
a
headmaster
generally
is
and
he
thought
he
could
tell
when
a
boy
was
speaking
the
truth
and
when
he
was
not
his
reflections
were
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
the
butler
entered
with
a
card
on
a
tray
alfred
venner
badgwick
hall
said
almost
shouted
the
card
he
read
the
words
without
any
apparent
pleasure
sir
alfred
here
himself
parker
he
said
is
sir
the
headmaster
sighed
inaudibly
but
very
wearily
he
was
feeling
worried
already
and
he
knew
from
experience
that
a
with
sir
alfred
venner
of
badgwick
hall
would
worry
him
still
more
the
head
was
a
man
who
tried
his
very
hardest
to
like
each
and
all
of
his
but
he
felt
bound
to
admit
that
he
liked
most
people
a
great
a
very
great
deal
better
than
he
liked
the
gentleman
who
had
just
sent
in
his
card
sir
alfred
manner
always
jarred
upon
him
it
was
so
exactly
the
antithesis
of
his
own
he
was
quiet
and
dignified
and
addressed
everybody
alike
courteously
sir
alfred
was
restless
and
fussy
his
manner
was
always
dictatorial
and
generally
rude
when
he
had
risen
in
the
house
to
make
his
maiden
speech
calling
the
attention
of
the
speaker
to
what
he
described
as
thorough
draught
he
had
addressed
himself
with
such
severity
to
that
official
that
a
party
of
siamese
noblemen
who
though
not
knowing
a
word
of
english
had
come
to
listen
to
the
debate
had
gone
away
with
the
impression
that
he
was
the
prime
minister
no
wonder
the
headmaster
sighed
him
in
parker
said
he
resignedly
parker
retired
leaving
the
head
to
wonder
what
his
visitor
grievance
might
be
this
time
sir
alfred
rarely
called
without
a
grievance
generally
connected
with
the
trespassing
of
the
school
on
his
land
evening
sir
alfred
he
said
as
his
visitor
whirled
into
the
room
this
sort
of
thing
wo
do
you
know
mr
perceval
said
sir
alfred
fussily
adjusting
a
pair
of
gold
on
his
nose
the
head
name
which
has
not
before
been
mentioned
was
the
reverend
herbert
perceval
he
had
shivered
at
the
sound
of
the
which
had
preceded
sir
alfred
remark
he
knew
as
did
other
unfortunate
people
that
the
great
man
was
at
his
worst
when
he
said
in
moments
of
comparative
calm
he
said
ca
put
up
with
it
you
know
mr
perceval
it
too
much
a
great
deal
too
much
refer
to
suggested
the
head
with
a
patience
that
did
him
credit
eternal
trespassing
and
tramping
in
and
out
of
my
grounds
all
day
have
been
misinformed
i
fear
sir
alfred
i
have
not
trespassed
in
your
grounds
for
ah
a
considerable
time
the
head
could
not
resist
this
thrust
in
his
unregenerate
days
he
had
been
a
power
at
the
union
where
many
a
foeman
had
exposed
himself
to
a
verbal
counter
from
him
with
disastrous
results
now
the
fencing
must
be
done
with
buttons
on
the
foils
what
i
do
follow
you
mr
perceval
understand
you
to
reproach
me
for
trespassing
and
ah
tramping
in
and
out
of
your
grounds
all
day
was
that
not
your
meaning
sir
alfred
almost
danced
with
impatience
no
no
you
misunderstand
me
you
do
follow
my
drift
that
case
i
beg
your
pardon
i
gathered
from
the
extreme
severity
of
your
attitude
towards
me
that
i
was
the
person
to
whom
you
referred
no
no
i
come
here
to
complain
of
your
boys
it
occurred
to
the
head
to
ask
if
the
complaint
embraced
the
entire
six
hundred
of
them
or
merely
referred
to
one
of
them
but
he
reflected
that
the
longer
he
fenced
the
longer
his
visitor
would
stay
and
he
decided
in
spite
of
the
illicit
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
the
exercise
that
it
was
not
worth
while
he
said
continued
sir
alfred
keepers
tell
me
the
woods
were
full
of
them
sir
the
head
suggested
that
possibly
the
keepers
had
exaggerated
possibly
they
may
have
exaggerated
but
that
is
not
the
point
the
nuisance
is
becoming
intolerable
mr
perceval
perfectly
intolerable
it
is
time
to
take
steps
have
already
done
all
that
can
be
done
i
have
placed
your
land
out
of
bounds
considerably
out
of
bounds
indeed
and
i
inflict
the
severest
penalties
when
a
breach
of
the
rule
is
reported
to
me
not
enough
it
not
nearly
enough
can
scarcely
do
more
i
fear
sir
alfred
there
are
more
than
six
hundred
boys
at
st
austin
and
it
is
not
within
my
power
to
place
them
all
under
my
personal
supervision
here
the
head
who
had
an
eye
to
the
humorous
conjured
up
a
picture
of
six
hundred
austinians
going
for
walks
two
and
two
the
staff
posted
at
intervals
down
the
procession
and
himself
bringing
up
the
rear
he
made
a
mental
mem
to
laugh
when
his
visitor
had
retired
said
the
baffled
thoughtfully
adjusting
his
once
more
no
no
perhaps
not
but
here
he
brightened
up
can
punish
them
when
they
do
trespass
is
so
sir
alfred
i
can
and
invariably
do
punish
that
plinkett
plunkett
i
got
the
name
down
somewhere
yes
plunkett
i
thought
so
punish
plunkett
said
the
head
taken
completely
by
surprise
he
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
had
imagined
plunkett
to
be
a
perfect
pattern
of
what
should
be
a
headmaster
like
other
judges
of
character
has
his
failures
yes
that
is
the
name
boy
with
spectacles
good
gracious
mr
perceval
do
tell
me
the
boy
gave
me
a
false
name
his
name
is
plunkett
am
i
to
understand
that
he
was
trespassing
on
your
land
surely
there
is
some
mistake
the
boy
a
here
it
suddenly
flashed
upon
his
mind
that
he
had
used
that
expression
before
in
the
course
of
the
day
on
the
occasion
when
mr
thompson
first
told
him
of
his
suspicions
in
connection
with
jim
mr
thompson
the
boy
a
had
been
his
exact
words
had
been
in
his
eyes
above
suspicion
it
is
a
bad
day
for
a
school
when
they
are
not
so
had
that
day
arrived
for
st
austin
he
asked
himself
may
be
a
mr
perceval
but
the
fact
remains
that
he
is
a
trespasser
and
ought
from
your
point
of
view
to
be
punished
for
breaking
bounds
the
head
suddenly
looked
almost
cheerful
again
course
he
said
course
i
thought
that
there
must
be
an
explanation
the
rules
respecting
bounds
sir
alfred
do
not
apply
to
only
to
the
rest
of
the
school
said
sir
alfred
his
tone
should
have
warned
the
head
that
something
more
was
coming
but
it
did
not
he
continued
course
it
was
very
wrong
of
him
to
trespass
on
your
land
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
did
it
quite
unintentionally
i
will
speak
to
him
and
i
think
i
can
guarantee
that
he
will
not
do
it
again
said
his
visitor
is
very
gratifying
i
am
sure
might
i
ask
mr
perceval
if
at
st
austin
have
any
other
privileges
the
head
began
to
look
puzzled
there
was
something
in
his
manner
which
suggested
unpleasant
possibilities
few
he
replied
have
a
few
technical
privileges
which
it
would
be
a
matter
of
some
little
time
to
explain
must
be
very
pleasant
to
be
a
prefect
at
st
austin
said
sir
alfred
nastily
pleasant
indeed
might
i
ask
mr
perceval
if
the
technical
privileges
to
which
you
refer
include
smoking
the
head
started
as
if
supposing
such
a
thing
possible
someone
had
pinched
him
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
question
from
the
expression
on
his
face
his
visitor
did
not
appear
to
be
perpetrating
a
joke
he
said
sharply
do
not
include
smoking
merely
asked
because
this
was
found
by
my
keeper
on
the
boy
when
he
caught
him
he
produced
a
small
silver
the
head
breathed
again
the
reputation
of
the
though
shaky
was
still
able
to
come
up
to
the
scratch
is
scarcely
a
proof
that
a
boy
has
been
smoking
i
think
said
he
boys
carry
matches
for
various
purposes
i
believe
i
myself
though
a
frequently
place
a
box
in
my
pocket
for
answer
sir
alfred
laid
a
bloated
and
exceedingly
plush
on
the
table
beside
the
also
he
observed
found
in
his
pocket
by
my
keeper
he
dived
his
hand
once
more
into
his
coat
also
this
he
said
and
with
the
air
of
a
who
trumps
his
opponent
ace
he
placed
on
the
pouch
a
pipe
and
to
make
the
matter
if
possible
worse
the
pipe
was
not
a
new
pipe
it
was
caked
within
and
coloured
without
a
pipe
that
had
seen
long
service
the
only
mitigating
circumstance
that
could
possibly
have
been
urged
in
favour
of
the
accused
namely
that
of
offence
had
vanished
is
pleasant
said
sir
alfred
with
laborious
sarcasm
find
a
trespasser
doing
a
thing
which
has
caused
the
dismissal
of
several
keepers
smoking
in
my
woods
i
will
not
permit
i
will
not
have
my
property
burnt
down
while
i
can
prevent
it
good
evening
mr
perceval
with
these
words
he
made
a
dramatic
exit
for
some
minutes
after
he
had
gone
the
head
remained
where
he
stood
thinking
then
he
went
across
the
room
and
touched
the
bell
he
said
when
that
invaluable
officer
appeared
across
to
mr
ward
house
and
tell
him
i
wish
to
see
plunkett
say
i
wish
to
see
him
at
once
after
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
plunkett
entered
the
room
looking
nervous
down
plunkett
plunkett
collapsed
into
a
seat
his
eye
had
caught
sight
of
the
smoking
apparatus
on
the
table
the
head
paced
the
room
something
after
the
fashion
of
the
tiger
at
the
zoo
whose
clock
strikes
lunch
he
said
suddenly
are
a
sir
murmured
plunkett
the
fact
was
undeniable
know
the
duties
of
a
sir
yet
you
deliberately
break
one
of
the
most
important
rules
of
the
school
how
long
have
you
been
in
the
habit
of
smoking
plunkett
evaded
the
question
father
lets
me
smoke
sir
when
i
at
home
a
hasty
word
in
the
reader
ear
if
ever
you
are
accused
of
smoking
please
for
my
sake
if
not
for
your
own
try
to
refrain
from
saying
that
your
father
lets
you
do
it
at
home
it
is
a
fatal
mistake
at
this
to
employ
a
metaphor
the
champagne
of
the
head
wrath
which
had
been
fermenting
steadily
during
his
late
interview
got
the
better
of
the
cork
of
and
he
exploded
if
the
mutual
friend
ever
has
grandchildren
he
will
probably
tell
them
with
bated
breath
the
story
of
how
the
head
paced
the
room
and
the
legend
of
the
things
he
said
but
it
will
be
some
time
before
he
will
be
able
to
speak
about
it
with
any
freedom
at
last
there
was
a
lull
in
the
storm
am
not
going
to
expel
you
plunkett
but
you
can
not
come
back
after
the
holidays
i
will
write
to
your
father
to
withdraw
you
he
pointed
to
the
door
plunkett
departed
in
level
time
did
the
old
want
you
for
asked
dallas
curiously
when
he
returned
to
the
study
plunkett
had
recovered
himself
by
this
time
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
tell
a
lie
wanted
to
tell
me
he
heard
from
my
father
about
my
leaving
your
leaving
dallas
tried
to
keep
his
voice
as
free
as
possible
from
triumphant
ecstasy
you
leaving
when
term
said
dallas
it
was
an
uncomfortable
moment
he
felt
that
at
least
some
conventional
expression
of
regret
ought
to
proceed
from
him
trouble
to
lie
about
being
sorry
said
plunkett
with
a
sneer
said
dallas
gratefully
you
mention
it
i
rather
think
i
wo
the
long
run
vaughan
came
up
soon
afterwards
and
dallas
told
him
the
great
news
they
were
neither
of
them
naturally
vindictive
but
the
mutual
friend
had
been
a
heavy
burden
to
them
during
his
stay
in
the
house
and
they
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
from
themselves
their
unfeigned
pleasure
at
the
news
of
his
impending
departure
never
say
another
word
against
mr
plunkett
senior
in
my
life
said
vaughan
a
philanthropist
i
wonder
what
the
mutual
going
to
do
gentleman
of
leisure
possibly
unless
he
going
to
the
thing
rather
i
do
know
a
bit
what
he
going
to
do
and
i
ca
say
i
care
much
he
going
that
the
main
point
say
said
vaughan
believe
the
old
man
was
holding
a
sort
of
reception
tonight
i
know
he
had
thomson
over
to
his
house
do
you
think
there
a
row
on
i
do
know
probably
only
wanted
to
see
if
he
was
all
right
after
the
mile
by
jove
it
was
a
bit
of
a
race
was
it
and
the
conversation
drifted
off
into
matters
athletic
there
were
two
persons
that
night
who
slept
badly
jim
lay
awake
until
the
college
clock
had
struck
three
going
over
in
his
mind
the
various
points
of
his
difficulties
on
the
chance
of
finding
a
solution
of
them
he
fell
asleep
at
a
quarter
past
without
having
made
any
progress
the
head
also
passed
a
bad
night
he
was
annoyed
for
many
reasons
principally
perhaps
because
he
had
allowed
sir
alfred
venner
to
score
so
signal
a
victory
over
him
besides
that
he
was
not
easy
in
his
mind
about
jim
he
could
not
come
to
a
decision
the
evidence
was
all
against
him
but
evidence
is
noted
for
its
untrustworthiness
the
head
would
have
preferred
to
judge
the
matter
from
his
knowledge
of
jim
character
but
after
the
plunkett
episode
he
mistrusted
his
powers
in
that
direction
he
thought
the
matter
over
for
a
time
and
then
finding
himself
unable
to
sleep
got
up
and
wrote
an
article
for
a
leading
review
on
the
subject
of
the
doxology
the
article
was
subsequently
rejected
which
proves
that
providence
is
not
altogether
incapable
of
a
kindly
action
but
it
served
its
purpose
by
sending
its
author
to
sleep
barrett
too
though
he
did
not
allow
it
to
interfere
with
his
slumbers
was
considerably
puzzled
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
about
the
cups
which
he
had
stumbled
upon
in
the
wood
he
scarcely
felt
equal
to
going
to
the
dingle
again
to
fetch
them
and
yet
every
minute
he
delayed
made
the
chances
of
their
remaining
there
more
remote
he
rather
hoped
that
reade
would
think
of
some
way
out
of
it
he
had
a
great
respect
for
reade
intellect
though
he
did
not
always
show
it
the
next
day
was
the
day
of
the
race
it
was
always
fixed
for
the
afternoon
after
sports
day
a
most
inconvenient
time
for
it
as
everybody
who
had
exerted
or
himself
the
afternoon
before
was
unable
to
do
himself
justice
today
contrary
to
general
expectation
both
drake
and
thomson
had
turned
out
the
knowing
ones
however
were
prepared
to
bet
anything
you
liked
except
cash
that
both
would
drop
out
before
the
first
mile
was
over
pinned
their
hopes
on
welch
at
that
time
welch
had
not
done
much
running
he
confined
himself
to
the
hundred
yards
and
the
quarter
but
he
had
it
in
him
to
do
great
things
as
he
proved
in
the
following
year
when
he
won
the
half
and
would
have
beaten
the
great
record
for
the
mile
but
for
an
accident
or
rather
an
event
which
prevented
his
running
the
tale
of
which
is
told
elsewhere
the
course
for
the
race
was
a
difficult
one
there
were
hedges
and
brooks
to
be
negotiated
and
worst
of
all
ploughed
fields
the
first
ploughed
field
usually
thinned
the
ranks
of
the
competitors
considerably
the
distance
was
about
ten
miles
the
race
started
at
three
jim
and
welch
merevale
first
string
set
the
pace
from
the
beginning
and
gradually
drew
away
from
the
rest
drake
came
third
and
following
him
the
rest
of
the
houses
in
a
crowd
welch
ran
easily
and
springily
jim
with
more
effort
he
felt
from
the
start
that
he
could
not
last
he
resolved
to
do
his
best
for
the
honour
of
the
house
but
just
as
the
second
mile
was
beginning
the
first
of
the
ploughed
fields
appeared
in
view
stretching
so
it
appeared
to
jim
right
up
to
the
horizon
he
groaned
on
welch
he
gasped
done
welch
stopped
short
in
his
stride
and
eyed
him
critically
he
said
get
back
to
the
house
you
overdid
it
yesterday
lie
down
somewhere
and
he
got
into
his
stride
again
jim
watched
his
figure
diminish
until
at
last
it
was
a
shapeless
dot
of
white
against
the
brown
surface
then
he
lay
down
on
his
back
and
panted
it
was
in
this
attitude
that
drake
found
him
for
a
moment
an
almost
irresistible
wish
seized
him
to
act
in
the
same
way
there
was
an
unstudied
comfort
about
jim
pose
which
appealed
to
him
strongly
his
wind
still
held
out
but
his
legs
were
beginning
to
feel
as
if
they
did
not
belong
to
him
at
all
he
pulled
up
for
an
instant
he
said
up
for
reply
jim
merely
grunted
said
drake
welch
ahead
lord
groaned
drake
and
pulling
himself
together
set
out
painfully
once
more
across
the
heavy
surface
of
the
field
jim
lay
where
he
was
a
little
longer
the
recollection
of
the
other
runners
who
might
be
expected
to
arrive
shortly
stirred
him
to
action
he
did
not
wish
to
interview
everyone
on
the
subject
of
his
dropping
out
he
struck
off
at
right
angles
towards
the
hedge
on
the
left
as
he
did
so
the
first
of
the
crowd
entered
the
field
simpson
wearing
the
colours
of
perkins
house
on
his
manly
bosom
was
leading
behind
him
came
a
group
of
four
two
school
house
dallas
of
ward
and
a
representative
of
prater
a
minute
later
they
were
followed
by
a
larger
group
consisting
this
time
of
twenty
or
more
runners
all
that
was
left
of
the
fifty
who
had
started
the
rest
had
dropped
out
at
the
sight
of
the
ploughed
field
jim
watched
the
procession
vanish
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
as
it
passed
out
of
sight
began
to
walk
slowly
back
to
the
school
again
he
reached
it
at
last
only
to
find
it
almost
entirely
deserted
in
merevale
house
there
was
nobody
he
had
hoped
that
charteris
and
tony
might
have
been
somewhere
about
when
he
had
changed
into
his
ordinary
clothes
he
made
a
tour
of
the
school
grounds
the
only
sign
of
life
as
far
as
he
could
see
was
biffen
who
was
superintending
the
cutting
of
the
grass
on
the
during
the
winter
biffen
always
disappeared
nobody
knew
where
returning
at
the
beginning
of
sports
week
to
begin
preparations
for
the
following
cricket
season
it
had
been
stated
that
during
the
winter
he
shut
himself
up
and
lived
on
himself
after
the
fashion
of
a
bear
others
believed
that
he
went
and
worked
in
some
welsh
mine
until
he
was
needed
again
at
the
school
biffen
himself
was
not
communicative
on
the
subject
a
fact
which
led
a
third
party
to
put
forward
the
awful
theory
that
he
was
a
professional
association
player
and
feared
to
mention
his
crime
in
a
school
which
worshipped
rugby
mr
thomson
he
said
as
jim
came
up
thought
you
was
running
whoa
the
last
remark
was
addressed
to
a
horse
attached
to
the
from
the
expression
on
its
face
the
animal
evidently
voted
the
whole
process
pure
foolishness
he
pulled
up
without
hesitation
and
biffen
turned
to
jim
again
they
ai
come
back
yet
he
said
have
said
jim
did
myself
up
rather
in
the
mile
yesterday
and
could
keep
up
the
pace
i
dropped
out
at
that
awfully
long
ploughed
field
by
parker
spinney
biffen
nodded
was
winning
sir
welch
was
leading
the
last
i
saw
of
it
should
wonder
if
he
won
either
he
was
going
all
right
i
say
the
place
seems
absolutely
deserted
is
anybody
about
what
mr
macarthur
was
saying
to
me
just
this
minute
sir
went
into
the
pavilion
i
go
and
hunt
for
him
biffen
the
horse
into
movement
again
jim
went
to
the
pavilion
and
met
the
babe
coming
down
the
steps
babe
i
was
looking
for
you
why
are
you
running
out
come
and
have
tea
in
my
study
i
tell
you
what
you
come
back
with
me
i
got
rather
a
decent
dog
i
want
to
show
you
only
got
him
yesterday
jim
revelled
in
dogs
so
he
agreed
instantly
the
babe
lived
with
his
parents
in
a
big
house
about
a
mile
from
the
college
and
in
so
doing
was
the
object
of
much
envy
amongst
those
who
had
to
put
up
with
life
at
the
houses
jim
had
been
to
his
home
once
or
twice
before
and
had
always
had
a
very
good
time
indeed
there
the
two
strolled
off
in
another
hour
the
place
began
to
show
signs
of
life
again
the
school
began
to
return
by
ones
and
twos
most
of
them
taking
up
a
position
near
the
big
gates
this
was
where
the
race
was
to
finish
there
was
a
straight
piece
of
road
about
two
hundred
yards
in
length
before
the
high
road
was
reached
it
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
when
the
runners
paced
by
their
respective
houses
on
each
side
of
the
road
swept
round
the
corner
and
did
their
best
to
sprint
with
all
that
was
left
in
them
after
ten
miles
of
difficult
country
suddenly
a
distant
shouting
began
to
be
heard
the
leaders
had
been
sighted
the
noise
increased
growing
nearer
and
nearer
until
at
last
it
swelled
into
a
roar
and
a
black
mass
of
runners
turned
the
corner
in
the
midst
of
the
black
was
one
white
figure
welch
as
calm
and
unruffled
as
if
he
had
been
returning
from
a
short
trot
to
improve
his
wind
merevale
surged
round
him
in
a
cheering
mob
welch
simply
disregarded
them
he
knew
where
he
wished
to
begin
his
sprint
and
he
would
begin
it
at
that
spot
and
no
other
the
spot
he
had
chosen
was
well
within
a
hundred
yards
from
the
gates
when
he
reached
it
he
let
himself
go
and
from
the
uproar
the
crowd
appeared
to
be
satisfied
a
long
pause
and
still
none
of
the
other
runners
appeared
five
minutes
went
by
before
they
began
to
appear
first
jones
of
the
school
house
and
simpson
who
raced
every
yard
of
the
way
and
finished
in
the
order
named
and
then
three
of
house
in
a
body
the
rest
dropped
in
at
intervals
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
the
headmaster
always
made
a
point
of
watching
the
finish
of
the
run
indeed
he
was
generally
one
of
the
last
to
leave
with
the
majority
of
the
spectators
it
was
enough
to
see
the
first
five
safely
in
the
last
man
and
arrived
almost
simultaneously
and
the
head
went
off
to
a
dinner
he
had
just
finished
this
meal
and
was
congratulating
himself
on
not
being
obliged
to
spend
the
evening
in
a
series
of
painful
interviews
as
had
happened
the
night
before
when
parker
the
butler
entered
the
room
parker
what
is
it
asked
he
roberts
sir
wishes
to
see
you
for
a
moment
the
head
was
at
a
loss
he
could
not
recall
any
friend
or
acquaintance
of
that
name
then
he
remembered
that
roberts
was
the
name
of
the
detective
who
had
come
down
from
london
to
look
into
the
matter
of
the
prizes
well
he
said
resignedly
him
into
the
study
parker
bowed
and
retired
the
head
after
an
interval
followed
him
and
made
his
way
to
the
study
mr
roberts
explains
inspector
roberts
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
door
examining
a
photograph
of
the
college
when
the
head
entered
he
spun
round
briskly
evening
mr
roberts
pray
be
seated
you
wish
to
see
me
the
detective
took
a
seat
business
of
the
cups
sir
said
the
head
you
made
any
progress
yes
very
considerable
progress
i
found
out
who
stole
them
have
cried
the
head
i
suppose
it
thomson
then
i
was
afraid
so
sir
that
was
certainly
not
the
name
he
gave
me
stokes
he
called
himself
stokes
this
is
curious
perhaps
if
you
were
to
describe
his
appearance
was
he
a
tall
boy
of
a
rather
slight
build
the
detective
interrupted
me
sir
but
i
rather
fancy
we
have
different
persons
in
our
mind
stokes
is
not
a
boy
not
at
all
well
over
thirty
red
moustache
height
five
foot
seven
i
should
say
not
more
works
as
a
farmhand
when
required
and
does
odd
jobs
at
times
that
the
man
the
head
face
expressed
relief
as
he
heard
this
description
thomson
did
not
do
it
after
all
he
said
queried
mr
roberts
explained
the
head
the
name
of
one
of
the
boys
at
the
school
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
strongly
suspected
him
of
this
robbery
boy
at
the
school
curious
unusual
i
should
have
thought
for
a
boy
to
be
mixed
up
in
an
affair
like
this
though
i
have
known
cases
was
very
unwilling
i
can
assure
you
to
suspect
him
of
such
a
thing
but
really
the
evidence
all
seemed
to
point
to
it
i
am
afraid
mr
roberts
that
i
have
been
poaching
on
your
preserves
without
much
success
thing
evidence
murmured
mr
roberts
fixing
with
his
eye
a
bust
of
socrates
on
the
as
if
he
wished
it
to
pay
particular
attention
to
his
words
curious
very
seldom
able
to
trust
it
case
the
other
day
man
charged
with
robbery
from
the
person
they
gave
the
case
to
me
worked
up
beautiful
case
against
the
man
not
a
hitch
anywhere
whole
thing
practically
proved
man
brings
forward
proves
it
turned
out
that
at
time
of
robbery
he
had
been
serving
seven
days
without
the
option
for
knocking
down
two
porters
and
a
guard
on
the
district
railway
yet
the
evidence
seemed
conclusive
yes
curious
thing
evidence
he
nodded
solemnly
at
socrates
and
resumed
an
interested
study
of
the
carpet
the
head
who
had
made
several
spirited
attempts
at
speaking
during
this
recital
at
last
succeeded
in
getting
in
a
word
have
the
cups
no
cups
still
missing
only
flaw
in
the
affair
perhaps
i
had
better
begin
from
the
beginning
pray
let
me
hear
the
whole
story
i
am
more
glad
than
i
can
say
that
thomson
is
innocent
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
i
hope
the
least
sir
not
the
very
least
stokes
is
the
man
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
the
inspector
paused
for
a
moment
coughed
and
drifted
into
his
narrative
saw
at
once
it
was
not
the
work
of
a
practised
burglar
first
place
how
could
regular
professional
know
that
the
cups
were
in
the
pavilion
at
all
quite
so
second
place
work
very
clumsily
done
no
neatness
not
the
professional
touch
at
all
tell
it
in
a
minute
no
mistaking
it
very
good
must
therefore
have
been
amateur
this
night
only
and
connected
with
school
next
question
who
helped
a
little
there
by
luck
capital
thing
luck
when
it
not
bad
luck
was
passing
by
the
village
inn
you
know
the
village
inn
i
dare
say
sir
the
head
slightly
scandalized
explained
that
he
was
seldom
in
the
village
the
detective
bowed
and
resumed
his
tale
i
passed
the
door
i
ran
into
a
man
coming
out
in
a
very
elevated
not
to
say
intoxicated
state
as
a
matter
of
fact
barely
able
to
stand
reeled
against
wall
and
dropped
handful
of
money
i
lent
helping
hand
and
picked
up
his
money
for
him
not
my
place
to
arrest
drunken
men
constable
no
constable
there
of
course
noticed
as
i
picked
the
money
up
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
it
for
ordinary
rustic
a
good
deal
sovereign
and
plenty
of
silver
he
paused
mused
for
a
while
and
went
on
again
sovereign
and
quite
ten
shillings
worth
of
silver
now
the
nature
of
my
profession
makes
me
a
suspicious
man
it
struck
me
as
curious
not
to
say
remarkable
that
such
a
man
should
have
thirty
shillings
or
more
about
him
so
late
in
the
week
and
then
there
was
another
thing
i
thought
i
seen
this
particular
man
somewhere
on
the
school
grounds
could
recall
his
face
exactly
but
just
had
a
sort
of
general
recollection
of
having
seen
him
before
i
happened
to
have
a
camera
with
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
been
taking
a
few
photographs
of
the
place
pretty
place
sir
agreed
the
head
photograph
yourself
perhaps
i
ah
do
not
pity
excellent
hobby
however
i
took
a
of
this
man
to
show
to
somebody
who
might
know
him
better
than
i
did
this
is
the
photograph
drunk
as
a
lord
is
he
not
he
exhibited
a
small
piece
of
paper
the
head
examined
it
gravely
and
admitted
that
the
subject
of
the
picture
did
not
appear
to
be
ostentatiously
sober
the
sunlight
beat
full
on
his
face
which
wore
the
intensely
solemn
expression
of
the
man
who
knowing
his
own
condition
hopes
by
means
of
exemplary
conduct
to
conceal
it
from
the
world
the
head
handed
the
photograph
back
without
further
comment
gave
the
man
back
his
money
went
on
mr
roberts
saw
him
safely
started
again
and
then
i
set
to
work
to
shadow
him
not
a
difficult
job
he
walked
very
slowly
and
for
all
he
seemed
to
care
the
whole
of
scotland
yard
might
have
been
shadowing
him
went
up
the
street
and
after
a
time
turned
in
at
one
of
the
cottages
i
marked
the
place
and
went
home
to
develop
the
photograph
took
it
to
show
the
man
who
looks
after
the
so
biffen
very
intelligent
man
given
me
a
good
deal
of
help
in
one
way
and
another
all
along
well
i
showed
it
to
him
and
he
said
he
thought
he
knew
the
face
was
almost
certain
it
was
one
of
the
men
at
work
on
the
grounds
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
showed
it
to
friend
of
his
the
other
he
thought
same
that
made
it
as
certain
as
i
had
any
need
for
went
off
at
once
to
the
man
cottage
found
him
sober
and
got
the
whole
thing
out
of
him
but
not
the
cups
he
had
been
meaning
to
sell
them
but
had
not
known
where
to
go
wanted
combination
of
good
price
and
complete
safety
very
hard
to
find
so
had
kept
cups
hidden
till
further
notice
here
the
head
interrupted
the
cups
where
are
they
said
the
detective
slowly
is
this
way
we
have
only
got
his
word
to
go
on
as
regards
the
cups
this
man
stokes
it
seems
is
a
notorious
poacher
the
night
after
the
robbery
he
took
the
cups
out
with
him
on
an
expedition
in
some
woods
that
lie
in
the
direction
of
badgwick
i
think
badgwick
is
the
name
not
sir
alfred
venner
woods
alfred
venner
it
was
sir
that
was
the
name
he
mentioned
stokes
appears
to
have
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
that
gentleman
property
pretty
frequently
he
had
a
regular
hiding
place
a
sort
of
store
where
he
used
to
keep
all
the
game
he
killed
he
described
the
place
to
me
it
is
a
big
tree
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
nearest
the
high
road
the
tree
is
hollow
one
has
to
climb
to
find
the
opening
to
it
inside
are
the
cups
and
i
should
say
a
good
deal
of
mixed
poultry
that
is
what
he
told
me
sir
i
should
advise
you
if
i
may
say
so
to
write
a
note
to
sir
alfred
venner
explaining
the
case
and
ask
him
to
search
the
tree
and
send
the
cups
on
here
this
idea
did
not
appeal
to
the
head
at
all
why
he
thought
bitterly
was
this
wretched
always
mixed
up
with
his
affairs
left
to
himself
he
could
have
existed
in
perfect
comfort
without
either
seeing
writing
to
or
hearing
from
the
great
man
again
for
the
rest
of
his
life
will
think
it
over
he
said
it
seems
the
only
thing
to
be
done
as
for
stokes
i
suppose
i
must
prosecute
the
detective
raised
a
hand
in
protest
my
interruption
sir
but
i
really
should
advise
you
not
to
prosecute
why
is
this
way
if
you
prosecute
you
get
the
man
his
term
of
imprisonment
a
year
probably
well
and
good
but
then
what
happens
after
his
sentence
has
run
out
he
comes
out
of
prison
an
tries
to
get
work
no
good
nobody
will
look
at
him
asks
for
a
job
people
lock
up
their
spoons
and
shout
for
the
police
what
happens
then
not
being
able
to
get
work
tries
another
burglary
being
a
clumsy
hand
at
the
game
gets
caught
again
and
sent
back
to
prison
and
so
is
ruined
and
becomes
a
danger
to
society
now
if
he
is
let
off
this
time
he
will
go
straight
for
the
rest
of
his
life
run
a
mile
to
avoid
a
silver
cup
he
badly
scared
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
scaring
him
more
told
him
nothing
would
happen
this
time
if
the
cups
came
back
safely
but
that
he
be
watched
ever
afterwards
to
see
he
did
not
get
into
mischief
of
course
he
wo
really
be
watched
you
understand
but
he
thinks
he
will
which
is
better
for
it
saves
trouble
besides
we
know
where
the
cups
are
i
feel
sure
he
was
speaking
the
truth
about
them
he
was
too
frightened
to
invent
a
story
and
here
is
most
of
the
money
so
it
all
ends
well
if
i
may
put
it
so
my
advice
sir
and
i
think
you
will
find
it
good
advice
is
not
to
prosecute
well
said
the
head
will
not
good
sir
good
morning
sir
and
he
left
the
room
the
head
rang
the
bell
said
he
across
to
mr
merevale
and
ask
him
to
send
thomson
to
me
it
was
with
mixed
feelings
that
he
awaited
jim
arrival
the
detective
story
had
shown
how
unjust
had
been
his
former
suspicions
and
he
felt
distinctly
uncomfortable
at
the
prospect
of
the
apology
which
he
felt
bound
to
make
to
him
on
the
other
hand
this
feeling
was
more
than
equalled
by
his
relief
at
finding
that
his
faith
in
the
virtue
of
the
though
at
fault
in
the
matter
of
plunkett
was
not
altogether
misplaced
it
made
up
for
a
good
deal
then
his
thoughts
drifted
to
sir
alfred
venner
struggle
with
his
feelings
as
he
might
the
head
could
endure
that
local
potentate
the
recent
interview
between
them
had
had
no
parallel
in
their
previous
acquaintance
but
the
head
had
always
felt
vaguely
irritated
by
his
manner
and
speech
and
he
had
always
feared
that
matters
would
come
to
a
head
sooner
or
later
the
prospect
of
opening
communication
with
him
once
more
was
not
alluring
in
the
meantime
there
was
his
more
immediate
duty
to
be
performed
the
apology
to
thomson
but
that
reminded
him
the
apology
must
only
be
of
a
certain
kind
it
must
not
be
grovelling
and
this
for
a
very
excellent
reason
after
the
apology
must
come
an
official
lecture
on
the
subject
of
betting
he
had
rather
lost
sight
of
that
offence
in
the
excitement
of
the
greater
crime
of
which
thomson
had
been
accused
and
very
nearly
convicted
now
the
full
heinousness
of
it
came
back
to
him
betting
scandalous
in
he
cried
as
a
knock
at
the
door
roused
him
from
his
thoughts
he
turned
but
instead
of
thomson
there
appeared
parker
parker
carried
a
note
it
was
from
mr
merevale
the
head
opened
it
he
cried
as
he
read
it
parker
made
no
comment
he
stood
in
the
doorway
trying
to
look
as
like
a
piece
of
furniture
as
possible
which
is
the
duty
of
a
good
butler
said
the
head
again
what
mr
merevale
had
said
in
his
note
was
this
that
thomson
was
not
in
the
house
and
had
not
been
in
the
house
since
lunchtime
he
ought
to
have
returned
at
six
it
was
now
eight
and
still
there
were
no
signs
of
him
mr
merevale
expressed
a
written
opinion
that
this
was
a
remarkable
thing
and
the
head
agreed
with
him
unreservedly
the
disappearance
of
thomson
certainly
the
head
was
surprised
he
read
the
note
again
no
there
was
no
mistake
is
not
in
the
house
there
could
be
no
two
meanings
about
that
across
to
mr
merevale
he
said
at
last
ask
him
if
he
would
mind
seeing
me
here
for
a
moment
the
butler
bowed
his
head
gently
but
with
more
than
a
touch
of
pained
astonishment
he
thought
the
headmaster
might
show
more
respect
for
persons
a
butler
is
not
an
he
said
giving
the
head
a
last
chance
as
it
were
of
realizing
the
situation
mr
merevale
to
step
over
here
for
a
moment
the
poor
man
bowed
once
more
the
phantom
of
a
cigar
floated
reproachfully
before
his
eyes
he
had
lit
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
in
fond
anticipation
of
a
quiet
evening
unless
a
miracle
had
occurred
it
must
be
out
by
this
time
and
he
knew
as
well
as
anybody
else
that
a
relighted
cigar
is
never
at
its
best
but
he
went
and
in
a
few
minutes
mr
merevale
entered
the
room
down
mr
merevale
said
the
head
i
to
understand
from
your
note
that
thomson
is
actually
not
in
the
house
mr
merevale
thought
that
if
he
had
managed
to
understand
anything
else
from
the
note
he
must
possess
a
mind
of
no
common
order
but
he
did
not
say
so
he
said
has
not
been
in
the
house
since
lunchtime
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
a
curious
thing
is
exceedingly
serious
exceedingly
so
for
many
reasons
have
you
any
idea
where
he
was
seen
last
in
my
house
says
he
saw
him
at
about
three
to
harrison
he
was
walking
in
the
direction
of
stapleton
well
it
is
satisfactory
to
know
even
as
little
as
that
so
but
mace
he
is
in
my
house
too
declares
that
he
saw
thomson
at
about
the
same
time
cycling
in
the
direction
of
badgwick
both
accounts
can
scarcely
be
correct
dear
me
are
you
certain
mr
merevale
merevale
nodded
to
imply
that
he
was
the
head
drummed
irritably
with
his
fingers
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
this
mystery
coming
as
it
did
after
the
series
of
worries
through
which
he
had
been
passing
for
the
last
few
days
annoyed
him
as
much
as
it
is
to
be
supposed
the
last
straw
annoyed
the
proverbial
camel
a
matter
of
fact
said
merevale
know
that
thomson
started
to
run
in
the
long
race
this
afternoon
i
met
him
going
to
the
and
advised
him
to
go
and
change
again
he
was
not
looking
at
all
fit
for
such
a
long
run
it
seems
to
me
that
welch
might
know
where
he
is
thomson
and
he
got
well
ahead
of
the
others
after
the
start
so
that
if
as
i
expect
thomson
dropped
out
early
in
the
race
welch
could
probably
tell
us
where
it
happened
that
would
give
us
some
clue
to
his
whereabouts
at
any
rate
you
questioned
welch
yet
welch
came
back
very
tired
quite
tired
out
in
fact
and
went
straight
to
bed
i
hardly
liked
to
wake
him
except
as
a
last
resource
perhaps
i
had
better
do
so
now
think
you
should
most
certainly
something
serious
must
have
happened
to
thomson
to
keep
him
out
of
his
house
as
late
as
this
unless
he
stopped
merevale
looked
up
enquiringly
the
head
after
a
deliberation
proceeded
to
explain
have
made
a
very
unfortunate
mistake
with
regard
to
thomson
mr
merevale
a
variety
of
reasons
led
me
to
think
that
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
this
theft
of
the
sports
prizes
broke
in
merevale
incredulously
was
a
considerable
weight
of
evidence
against
him
which
i
have
since
found
to
be
perfectly
untrustworthy
but
which
at
the
time
seemed
to
me
almost
conclusive
surely
put
in
merevale
again
thomson
would
be
the
last
boy
to
do
such
a
thing
why
should
he
what
would
he
gain
by
it
i
can
understand
that
perfectly
in
the
light
of
certain
information
which
i
have
just
received
from
the
inspector
but
at
the
time
as
i
say
i
believed
him
guilty
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
send
for
him
and
question
him
upon
the
subject
now
it
has
occurred
to
me
mr
merevale
you
understand
that
i
put
it
forward
merely
as
a
conjecture
it
occurs
to
me
thomson
has
run
away
said
merevale
bluntly
the
head
slightly
discomposed
by
this
reading
of
his
thoughts
pulled
himself
together
and
said
just
so
i
think
it
very
possible
do
not
agree
with
you
said
merevale
know
thomson
well
and
i
think
he
is
the
last
boy
to
do
such
a
thing
he
is
neither
a
fool
nor
a
coward
to
put
it
shortly
and
he
would
need
to
have
a
great
deal
of
both
in
him
to
run
away
the
head
looked
slightly
relieved
at
this
ah
think
so
he
said
certainly
do
in
the
first
place
where
unless
he
went
home
would
he
run
to
and
as
he
would
be
going
home
in
a
couple
of
days
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
he
would
hardly
be
foolish
enough
to
risk
expulsion
in
such
a
way
mr
merevale
always
rather
enjoyed
his
straight
talks
with
the
headmaster
unlike
most
of
his
colleagues
he
stood
in
no
awe
of
him
whatever
he
always
found
him
ready
to
listen
to
sound
argument
and
what
was
better
willing
to
be
convinced
it
was
so
in
this
case
i
think
we
may
dismiss
that
idea
said
the
head
with
visible
relief
the
idea
of
such
a
scandal
occurring
at
st
austin
had
filled
him
with
unfeigned
horror
now
i
think
it
would
be
as
well
to
go
across
to
your
house
and
hear
what
welch
has
to
say
about
the
matter
unless
thomson
returns
soon
and
it
is
already
past
nine
we
shall
have
to
send
out
five
minutes
later
welch
enjoying
a
sound
began
to
be
possessed
of
a
vague
idea
that
somebody
was
trying
to
murder
him
his
subsequent
struggles
for
life
partially
woke
him
and
enabled
him
to
see
dimly
that
two
figures
were
standing
by
his
bed
he
murmured
sleepily
turning
over
on
to
his
side
again
and
preparing
to
doze
off
the
shaking
continued
this
was
too
much
here
said
he
fiercely
sitting
up
then
he
recognized
his
visitors
as
his
eye
fell
on
merevale
he
wondered
whether
anything
had
occurred
to
bring
down
his
wrath
upon
him
perhaps
he
had
gone
to
bed
without
leave
and
was
being
routed
out
to
read
at
prayers
or
do
some
work
no
he
remembered
distinctly
getting
permission
to
turn
in
what
then
could
be
the
matter
at
this
point
he
recognized
the
headmaster
and
the
last
mists
of
sleep
left
him
sir
he
said
now
merevale
put
the
case
briefly
and
clearly
to
him
to
disturb
you
welch
i
know
you
are
tired
at
all
sir
said
welch
politely
there
is
something
we
must
ask
you
you
probably
do
not
know
that
thomson
has
not
returned
returned
nobody
knows
where
he
is
you
were
probably
the
last
to
see
him
what
happened
when
you
and
he
started
for
the
long
run
this
afternoon
you
lost
sight
of
the
rest
did
you
not
sir
thomson
dropped
out
this
from
the
headmaster
sir
he
said
he
could
go
any
farther
he
told
me
to
go
on
and
of
course
i
did
as
it
was
a
race
i
advised
him
to
go
back
to
the
house
and
change
he
looked
regularly
done
up
i
think
he
ran
too
hard
in
the
mile
yesterday
the
head
spoke
thought
that
some
such
thing
must
have
happened
where
was
it
that
he
dropped
out
welch
was
just
as
we
came
to
a
long
ploughed
field
sir
by
the
side
of
a
big
wood
spinney
i
expect
put
in
merevale
sir
about
a
mile
from
the
college
you
saw
nothing
more
of
him
after
that
enquired
the
headmaster
sir
he
was
lying
on
his
back
when
i
left
him
i
should
think
some
of
the
others
must
have
seen
him
after
i
did
he
did
look
as
if
he
was
likely
to
get
up
for
some
time
said
the
head
as
he
and
merevale
went
out
of
the
room
leaving
welch
to
his
slumbers
have
gained
little
by
seeing
welch
i
had
hoped
for
something
more
i
must
send
the
prefects
out
to
look
for
thomson
at
once
will
be
a
difficult
business
said
merevale
refraining
to
his
credit
be
it
said
from
a
mention
of
needles
and
haystacks
have
nothing
to
go
upon
he
may
be
anywhere
for
all
we
know
i
suppose
it
is
hardly
likely
that
he
is
still
where
welch
left
him
the
head
seemed
to
think
this
improbable
would
scarcely
be
the
case
unless
he
were
very
much
exhausted
it
is
more
than
five
hours
since
welch
saw
him
i
can
hardly
believe
that
the
worst
exhaustion
would
last
so
long
however
if
you
would
kindly
tell
your
of
this
send
them
out
to
search
we
must
do
all
we
can
tell
them
to
begin
searching
where
thomson
was
last
seen
i
will
go
round
to
the
other
houses
dear
me
this
is
exceedingly
annoying
exceedingly
so
merevale
admitted
that
it
was
and
having
seen
his
visitor
out
of
the
house
went
to
the
studies
to
speak
to
his
prefects
he
found
charteris
and
tony
together
in
the
former
sanctum
anything
been
heard
about
thomson
sir
said
tony
as
he
entered
is
just
what
i
want
to
see
you
about
graham
will
you
go
and
bring
the
rest
of
the
prefects
here
he
said
as
tony
returned
with
swift
and
daintree
the
two
remaining
all
know
of
course
that
thomson
is
not
in
the
house
the
headmaster
wants
you
to
go
and
look
for
him
welch
seems
to
have
been
the
last
to
see
him
and
he
left
him
lying
in
a
ploughed
field
near
parker
spinney
you
all
know
parker
spinney
i
suppose
sir
you
had
better
begin
searching
from
there
go
in
twos
if
you
like
or
singly
do
all
go
together
i
want
you
all
to
be
back
by
eleven
all
got
watches
sir
you
better
take
lanterns
of
some
sort
i
think
i
can
raise
a
bicycle
lamp
each
and
there
is
a
good
moon
look
everywhere
and
shout
as
much
as
you
like
i
think
he
must
have
sprained
an
ankle
or
something
he
is
probably
lying
somewhere
unable
to
move
and
too
far
away
from
the
road
to
make
his
voice
heard
to
anyone
if
you
start
now
you
will
have
just
an
hour
and
a
half
you
should
have
found
him
by
then
the
prefects
from
the
other
houses
will
help
you
daintree
put
in
a
pertinent
question
about
trespassing
sir
go
where
you
like
in
reason
you
know
do
go
getting
the
school
mixed
up
in
any
unpleasantness
of
course
but
remember
that
your
main
object
is
to
find
thomson
you
all
understand
sir
good
then
start
at
once
jove
said
swift
when
he
had
gone
an
unholy
rag
this
suits
yours
truly
poor
old
jim
though
i
wonder
what
the
deuce
has
happened
to
him
at
that
very
moment
the
headmaster
leaving
philpott
house
to
go
to
prater
was
wondering
the
same
thing
in
spite
of
mr
argument
he
found
himself
drifting
back
to
his
former
belief
that
jim
had
run
away
what
else
could
keep
him
out
of
his
house
more
than
three
hours
after
and
he
had
had
some
reason
for
running
away
for
the
mens
recti
though
an
excellent
institution
in
theory
is
not
nearly
so
useful
an
ally
as
it
should
be
in
practice
the
head
knocked
at
prater
door
pondering
darkly
within
himself
proceed
to
search
for
thomson
if
he
be
above
the
sweet
the
moonlight
sleeps
on
yonder
haystack
observed
charteris
poetically
as
he
and
tony
accompanied
by
swift
and
daintree
made
their
way
across
the
fields
to
parker
spinney
each
carried
a
bicycle
lamp
and
at
irregular
intervals
each
broke
into
piercing
yells
to
the
marked
discomfort
of
certain
birds
roosting
in
the
neighbourhood
who
burst
noisily
from
the
trees
and
made
their
way
with
visible
disgust
to
quieter
spots
one
thing
said
swift
ought
to
hear
him
if
he
yells
on
a
night
like
this
a
yell
ought
to
travel
about
a
mile
we
try
one
now
said
charteris
a
concerted
piece
in
time
ready
the
next
moment
the
stillness
of
the
lovely
spring
night
was
shattered
by
a
hideous
uproar
said
charteris
to
space
in
general
as
the
echoes
died
away
but
there
was
no
answer
though
they
waited
several
minutes
on
the
chance
of
hearing
some
sound
that
would
indicate
jim
whereabouts
he
did
hear
that
observed
tony
ca
be
within
three
miles
that
a
cert
we
better
separate
i
think
they
were
at
the
ploughed
field
by
parker
spinney
now
got
a
coin
asked
daintree
toss
for
directions
charteris
produced
a
shilling
ewe
lamb
he
said
tails
it
was
charteris
expressed
his
intention
of
striking
westward
and
drawing
the
spinney
he
and
tony
made
their
way
thither
swift
and
daintree
moving
off
together
in
the
opposite
direction
is
jolly
rum
said
tony
as
they
entered
the
spinney
wonder
where
the
deuce
the
man
has
got
to
it
beastly
serious
really
but
i
hanged
if
i
can
help
feeling
as
if
i
were
out
on
a
picnic
i
suppose
it
the
night
air
wonder
if
we
shall
find
him
the
slightest
chance
in
my
opinion
there
not
the
least
good
in
looking
through
this
forsaken
spinney
still
we
better
do
it
do
make
a
row
we
trespassing
they
moved
on
in
silence
through
the
wood
charteris
caught
his
foot
in
a
hole
and
fell
said
tony
in
spirit
thanks
the
absolute
dashed
foolishness
of
this
is
being
rapidly
borne
in
upon
me
tony
what
the
good
of
it
we
sha
find
him
here
tony
put
his
foot
down
upon
these
opinions
with
exemplary
promptitude
must
go
on
trying
hang
it
all
if
it
comes
to
the
worst
better
than
frousting
indoors
you
a
philosopher
lead
on
macduff
tony
was
about
to
do
so
when
a
form
appeared
in
front
of
him
blocking
the
way
he
flashed
his
lamp
at
the
form
and
the
form
prefacing
its
remarks
with
a
good
honest
swearword
of
a
variety
peculiar
to
that
part
of
the
country
requested
him
without
any
affectation
of
ceremonious
courtesy
to
take
his
lamp
out
of
his
the
form
face
and
state
his
business
briefly
i
know
that
voice
said
charteris
my
brother
the
keeper
failed
to
understand
him
and
said
so
tersely
you
tell
went
on
charteris
you
have
seen
such
a
thing
as
a
boy
in
this
spinney
lately
we
happen
to
have
lost
one
an
ordinary
boy
no
special
markings
his
name
is
thomson
on
the
grampian
hills
at
this
point
the
keeper
felt
that
he
had
had
enough
he
made
a
dive
for
the
speaker
charteris
dodged
behind
tony
and
his
assailant
not
observing
this
proceeded
to
lay
violent
hands
upon
the
latter
who
had
been
standing
waiting
during
the
conversation
go
you
fool
cried
he
the
keeper
hand
had
come
smartly
into
contact
with
his
left
eye
and
from
there
had
taken
up
a
position
on
his
shoulder
in
reply
the
keeper
merely
tightened
his
grip
count
three
said
tony
the
keeper
hand
shifted
to
his
collar
right
then
said
tony
between
his
teeth
he
hit
up
with
his
left
at
the
keeper
wrist
the
hand
on
his
collar
loosed
its
grip
its
owner
rushed
and
as
he
came
tony
hit
him
in
the
parts
about
the
third
with
his
right
he
staggered
and
fell
tony
hit
very
hard
when
the
spirit
moved
him
on
man
said
charteris
quickly
he
gets
his
wind
again
we
must
be
booked
trespassing
tony
recognized
the
soundness
of
the
advice
they
were
out
of
the
spinney
in
two
minutes
said
charteris
do
a
steady
double
to
the
road
this
is
no
place
for
us
come
on
you
man
of
blood
when
they
reached
the
road
they
slowed
down
to
a
walk
again
charteris
laughed
feel
just
as
if
we
done
a
murder
somehow
what
an
ass
that
fellow
was
to
employ
violence
he
went
down
all
right
did
he
there
be
a
row
should
think
not
he
did
see
us
properly
anyhow
he
was
interfering
with
an
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
so
were
we
i
suppose
well
let
hope
for
the
best
hullo
up
right
it
only
somebody
coming
down
the
road
thought
it
might
be
the
keeper
at
first
why
it
biffen
it
was
biffen
he
looked
at
them
casually
as
he
came
up
but
stopped
short
in
surprise
when
he
saw
who
they
were
charteris
same
said
charteris
a
moonlight
stroll
biffen
what
are
you
doing
out
of
the
at
this
time
of
night
mr
charteris
this
way
said
tony
the
have
been
sent
out
to
look
for
thomson
he
not
come
back
come
back
sir
bit
queer
is
it
the
last
anybody
saw
of
him
was
when
he
dropped
out
of
the
long
race
near
parker
spinney
seen
him
later
than
that
mr
graham
he
come
on
to
the
grounds
while
i
was
mowing
the
cricket
field
really
when
was
that
past
four
nearly
became
of
him
went
off
with
mr
macarthur
mr
macarthur
took
off
with
i
think
sir
jove
said
charteris
with
enthusiasm
we
on
the
track
thanks
awfully
biffen
i
remember
you
in
my
will
come
on
tony
are
you
going
now
place
of
course
the
babe
holds
the
clue
to
this
business
we
must
get
it
out
of
him
biffen
sir
arrived
at
the
babe
residence
they
rang
the
bell
and
in
the
interval
of
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
opened
listened
with
envy
to
certain
sounds
of
revelry
which
filtered
through
the
windows
of
a
room
to
the
right
of
the
porch
babe
seems
to
be
making
a
night
of
it
said
charteris
as
the
servant
opened
the
door
we
see
mr
macarthur
please
the
servant
looked
doubtful
on
the
point
company
tonight
sir
knew
he
was
making
a
night
of
it
said
charteris
to
tony
not
mr
macarthur
we
want
to
see
it
dash
it
what
the
babe
name
i
believe
would
swear
to
it
robert
is
he
in
it
seemed
to
charteris
that
the
form
of
this
question
smacked
of
ollendorf
he
half
expected
the
servant
to
say
but
he
has
the
mackintosh
of
his
brother
cousin
it
produced
the
desired
effect
however
for
after
inviting
them
to
step
in
the
servant
disappeared
and
the
babe
came
on
the
scene
wearing
a
singularly
prosperous
expression
as
if
he
had
dined
well
you
chaps
he
said
to
you
said
charteris
here
babe
we
want
to
know
what
you
have
done
with
jim
he
was
seen
by
competent
witnesses
to
go
off
with
you
and
he
not
come
back
if
you
murdered
him
you
might
let
us
have
the
body
come
back
rot
are
you
certain
dear
chap
every
on
the
list
has
been
sent
out
to
look
for
him
when
did
he
leave
here
the
babe
reflected
i
should
think
little
after
perhaps
why
oh
lord
he
broke
off
suddenly
up
asked
tony
i
sent
him
by
a
short
cut
through
some
woods
close
by
here
and
i
only
just
remembered
there
a
sort
of
quarry
in
the
middle
of
them
i
bet
he
in
there
scott
man
what
sort
of
a
quarry
i
like
the
calm
way
the
babe
talks
of
sending
unsuspecting
friends
into
quarries
deep
very
thank
goodness
still
if
he
fell
down
he
might
not
be
able
to
get
up
again
especially
if
he
hurt
himself
at
all
half
a
second
let
me
get
on
some
boots
and
i
come
out
and
look
sha
be
long
when
he
came
back
the
three
of
them
set
out
for
the
quarry
you
are
cried
the
babe
with
an
entirely
improper
pride
in
his
voice
considering
the
circumstances
did
i
tell
you
out
of
the
darkness
in
front
of
them
came
a
shout
they
recognized
the
voice
at
once
as
jim
tony
uttered
a
yell
of
encouragement
and
was
darting
forward
to
the
spot
from
which
the
cry
had
come
when
the
babe
stopped
him
do
that
man
he
said
be
over
yourself
if
you
do
look
out
it
quite
close
here
he
flashed
one
of
the
lamps
in
front
of
him
the
light
fell
on
a
black
opening
in
the
ground
and
jim
voice
sounded
once
more
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
this
time
quite
close
to
where
they
stood
shouted
charteris
are
you
said
the
voice
that
you
might
lug
me
out
of
here
you
hurt
my
ankle
far
down
are
you
far
ten
feet
about
ca
you
get
me
out
a
second
said
the
babe
go
and
get
help
you
chaps
had
better
stay
here
and
talk
to
him
he
ran
off
many
of
you
are
there
up
there
asked
jim
tony
and
myself
said
charteris
i
heard
somebody
else
that
was
the
babe
he
gone
off
to
get
help
when
he
comes
back
wring
his
neck
and
heave
him
down
here
said
jim
want
a
word
with
him
on
the
subject
of
short
cuts
i
say
is
there
much
excitement
about
this
all
the
are
out
after
you
we
been
looking
in
parker
spinney
and
tony
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
knock
out
a
keeper
who
tried
to
stop
us
you
should
have
been
there
it
was
a
rag
i
had
been
hullo
is
that
the
babe
come
back
it
was
the
babe
with
his
father
and
a
party
of
friends
arrayed
in
evening
dress
they
carried
a
ladder
amongst
them
the
pungent
remarks
jim
had
intended
to
address
to
the
babe
had
no
opportunity
of
active
service
it
was
not
the
babe
who
carried
him
up
the
ladder
but
two
of
the
nor
did
the
babe
have
a
hand
in
the
carrying
of
the
stretcher
that
was
done
by
as
many
of
the
brigade
as
could
get
near
enough
they
seemed
to
enjoy
it
one
of
them
remarked
that
it
reminded
him
of
south
africa
to
which
another
replied
that
it
was
far
more
like
a
party
of
policemen
gathering
in
an
drunk
in
the
marylebone
road
the
procession
moved
on
its
stately
way
to
the
babe
father
house
and
the
last
tony
and
charteris
saw
of
jim
he
was
the
centre
of
attraction
and
appeared
to
be
enjoying
himself
very
much
charteris
envied
him
and
did
not
mind
saying
so
ca
smash
my
ankle
he
demanded
indignantly
of
tony
he
was
nearing
section
five
three
of
his
discourse
when
they
reached
merevale
gates
it
was
after
eleven
but
they
felt
that
the
news
they
were
bringing
entitled
them
to
be
a
little
late
charteris
brought
his
arguments
to
a
premature
end
and
tony
rang
the
bell
merevale
himself
opened
the
door
to
them
in
which
the
affairs
of
various
persons
are
wound
up
he
said
rather
late
any
luck
found
him
sir
said
tony
that
a
good
thing
where
was
he
fallen
down
a
sort
of
quarry
place
near
where
macarthur
lives
macarthur
took
him
home
with
him
to
tea
and
sent
him
back
by
a
short
cut
forgetting
all
about
the
quarry
and
thomson
fell
in
and
get
out
again
he
hurt
twisted
his
ankle
sir
where
is
he
now
carried
him
back
to
the
house
house
sir
well
i
suppose
he
will
be
all
right
then
graham
just
go
across
and
report
to
the
headmaster
will
you
you
find
him
in
his
study
the
head
was
immensely
relieved
to
hear
tony
narrative
after
much
internal
debate
he
had
at
last
come
to
the
conclusion
that
jim
must
have
run
away
and
he
had
been
wondering
how
he
should
inform
his
father
of
the
fact
are
certain
that
he
is
not
badly
hurt
graham
he
said
when
tony
had
finished
his
story
sir
it
only
his
ankle
good
graham
the
head
retired
to
bed
that
night
filled
with
a
virtuous
resolve
to
seek
jim
out
on
the
following
day
and
speak
a
word
in
season
to
him
on
the
subject
of
crime
in
general
and
betting
in
particular
this
plan
he
proceeded
to
carry
out
as
soon
as
afternoon
school
was
over
when
however
he
had
arrived
at
the
babe
house
he
found
that
there
was
one
small
thing
which
he
had
left
out
of
his
calculations
he
had
counted
on
seeing
the
invalid
alone
on
entering
the
he
found
there
mrs
macarthur
looking
as
if
she
intended
to
remain
where
she
sat
for
several
hours
which
indeed
actually
was
her
intention
and
miss
macarthur
whose
face
and
attitude
expressed
the
same
only
if
anything
more
so
the
fact
was
that
the
babe
a
very
monument
of
resource
on
occasions
had
as
he
told
jim
them
the
tip
not
to
let
the
old
man
get
at
him
unless
he
absolutely
chucked
them
out
you
know
when
he
had
seen
the
headmaster
approaching
he
had
gone
hurriedly
to
jim
room
to
mention
the
fact
with
excellent
results
the
head
took
a
seat
by
the
bed
and
asked
with
a
touch
of
nervousness
after
the
injured
ankle
this
induced
mrs
macarthur
to
embark
on
a
disquisition
concerning
the
ease
with
which
ankles
are
twisted
from
which
she
drifted
easily
into
a
discussion
of
rugby
football
its
merits
and
demerits
the
head
after
several
vain
attempts
to
jerk
the
conversation
into
other
grooves
gave
it
up
and
listened
for
some
ten
minutes
to
a
series
of
anecdotes
about
various
friends
and
acquaintances
of
mrs
macarthur
who
had
either
twisted
their
own
ankles
or
known
people
who
had
twisted
theirs
the
head
began
to
forget
what
exactly
he
had
come
to
say
that
afternoon
jim
lay
and
grinned
covertly
through
it
all
when
the
head
did
speak
his
first
words
roused
him
effectually
suppose
mrs
macarthur
your
son
has
told
you
that
we
have
had
a
burglary
at
the
school
it
thought
jim
is
playing
the
game
at
all
why
talk
shop
especially
that
particular
brand
of
shop
here
he
wondered
if
the
head
intended
to
describe
the
burglary
and
then
spring
to
his
feet
with
a
dramatic
wave
of
the
hand
towards
him
and
say
mrs
macarthur
is
the
criminal
there
lies
the
viper
on
whom
you
have
lavished
your
hospitality
the
snaky
and
systematic
serpent
you
have
been
induced
by
underhand
means
to
pity
look
upon
him
and
loathe
him
stole
the
cups
indeed
replied
mrs
macarthur
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
it
i
suppose
you
have
never
found
out
who
it
was
that
did
it
jim
lay
back
resignedly
after
all
he
had
not
done
it
and
if
the
head
liked
to
say
he
had
well
let
him
did
care
mrs
macarthur
we
have
managed
to
discover
him
who
was
it
asked
mrs
macarthur
much
interested
for
it
said
jim
to
himself
found
that
it
was
a
man
living
in
the
village
who
had
been
doing
some
work
on
the
school
grounds
he
had
evidently
noticed
the
value
of
the
cups
and
determined
to
try
his
hand
at
appropriating
them
he
is
well
known
as
a
poacher
in
the
village
it
seems
i
think
that
for
the
future
he
will
confine
himself
to
that
ah
industry
for
he
is
hardly
likely
ever
to
ah
shine
as
a
professional
no
well
that
must
be
a
relief
to
you
i
am
sure
mr
perceval
these
poachers
are
a
terrible
nuisance
they
do
frighten
the
birds
so
she
spoke
as
if
it
were
an
unamiable
eccentricity
on
the
part
of
the
poachers
which
they
might
be
argued
out
of
if
the
matter
were
put
before
them
in
a
reasonable
manner
the
head
agreed
with
her
and
rose
to
go
jim
watched
him
out
of
the
room
and
then
breathed
a
deep
satisfying
breath
of
relief
his
troubles
were
at
an
end
in
the
meantime
barrett
who
having
no
inkling
as
to
the
rate
at
which
affairs
had
been
progressing
since
his
visit
to
the
dingle
still
imagined
that
the
secret
of
the
hollow
tree
belonged
exclusively
to
reade
himself
and
one
other
was
much
exercised
in
his
mind
about
it
reade
candidly
confessed
himself
baffled
by
the
problem
give
him
something
moderately
straightforward
and
he
was
all
right
this
secret
society
and
dark
lantern
style
of
affair
was
he
acknowledged
beyond
him
and
so
it
came
about
that
barrett
resolved
to
do
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
and
go
to
the
head
about
it
but
before
he
had
come
to
this
decision
the
head
had
received
another
visit
from
mr
roberts
as
a
result
of
which
the
table
where
sir
alfred
venner
had
placed
plunkett
pipe
and
other
accessories
so
dramatically
during
a
previous
interview
now
bore
another
burden
the
missing
cups
mr
roberts
had
gone
to
the
dingle
in
person
and
by
adroit
use
of
the
divinity
which
hedges
a
detective
had
persuaded
a
keeper
to
lead
him
to
the
tree
where
as
mr
stokes
had
said
the
cups
had
been
deposited
the
head
first
act
on
getting
the
cups
was
to
send
for
welch
to
whom
by
right
of
conquest
they
belonged
welch
arrived
shortly
before
barrett
the
head
was
just
handing
him
his
prizes
when
the
latter
came
into
the
room
it
speaks
well
for
barrett
presence
of
mind
that
he
had
grasped
the
situation
and
decided
on
his
line
of
action
before
welch
went
and
the
head
turned
his
attention
to
him
barrett
said
the
head
you
please
sir
said
barrett
blandly
i
have
leave
to
go
to
stapleton
barrett
why
do
you
wish
to
go
this
was
something
of
a
poser
but
barrett
brain
worked
quickly
wanted
to
send
a
telegram
sir
well
but
with
suspicion
did
you
not
ask
mr
philpott
your
can
give
you
leave
to
go
to
stapleton
could
find
him
sir
this
was
true
for
he
had
not
looked
very
well
you
sir
and
barrett
went
off
to
tell
reade
that
in
some
mysterious
manner
the
cups
had
come
back
on
their
own
account
when
jim
had
congratulated
himself
that
everything
had
ended
happily
at
any
rate
as
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
he
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
at
present
he
had
only
one
pound
to
his
credit
instead
of
the
two
which
he
needed
charteris
however
had
not
the
special
number
of
glow
was
due
on
the
following
day
and
accident
left
a
considerable
amount
of
to
be
accounted
for
he
questioned
tony
on
the
subject
here
tony
have
you
time
to
do
any
more
stuff
for
glow
worm
dear
chap
said
tony
not
half
done
my
own
bits
ask
welch
asked
him
just
now
he
ca
besides
he
only
writes
at
about
the
rate
of
one
word
a
minute
and
we
must
get
it
all
in
by
tonight
at
i
going
to
sit
up
as
it
is
to
jellygraph
it
what
up
tony
face
had
assumed
an
expression
of
dismay
he
said
scott
i
never
thought
of
it
before
if
we
jellygraph
it
our
handwriting
be
recognized
and
that
will
give
the
whole
show
away
charteris
took
a
seat
and
faced
this
difficulty
in
all
its
aspects
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
and
yet
it
should
have
been
obvious
have
to
copy
the
whole
thing
out
in
he
said
desperately
at
last
aunt
what
a
job
help
said
tony
will
too
i
should
think
if
you
ask
him
how
many
jelly
machine
things
can
you
raise
got
three
one
for
each
of
us
wait
a
bit
i
go
and
ask
welch
welch
having
first
ascertained
that
the
matter
really
was
a
pressing
one
agreed
without
hesitation
he
had
objections
to
spoiling
his
sleep
without
reason
but
in
moments
of
emergency
he
put
comfort
behind
him
said
charteris
when
this
had
been
settled
here
as
soon
as
you
can
after
eleven
i
tell
you
what
we
do
the
thing
in
style
and
brew
it
ought
to
take
more
than
an
hour
or
so
it
be
rather
a
rag
than
otherwise
how
about
jim
stuff
asked
welch
shall
have
to
do
that
as
you
ca
i
done
my
own
bits
i
think
i
better
start
now
he
did
and
with
success
when
he
went
to
bed
at
ten
glow
was
ready
in
manuscript
only
the
copying
and
printing
remained
to
be
done
charteris
was
out
of
bed
and
in
the
study
just
as
eleven
struck
tony
and
welch
arriving
later
found
him
hard
at
work
copying
out
an
article
of
topical
interest
in
a
fair
round
hand
quite
unrecognizable
as
his
own
it
was
an
impressive
scene
the
gas
had
been
cut
off
as
it
always
was
when
the
house
went
to
bed
and
they
worked
by
the
light
of
candles
occasionally
welch
breathing
heavily
in
his
efforts
to
make
his
handwriting
look
like
that
of
a
member
of
a
second
standard
blew
one
or
more
of
the
candles
out
and
the
others
grunted
fiercely
that
was
all
they
could
do
for
for
evident
reasons
a
vow
of
silence
had
been
imposed
charteris
was
the
first
to
finish
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
the
chair
which
at
a
reasonable
hour
of
the
day
would
have
endured
any
treatment
collapsed
now
with
a
noise
like
a
you
done
it
said
tony
breaking
all
rules
by
speaking
considerably
above
a
whisper
welch
went
to
the
door
and
listened
the
house
was
still
they
settled
down
once
more
to
work
charteris
lit
the
and
began
to
prepare
the
meal
the
others
toiled
painfully
on
at
their
they
finished
almost
simultaneously
another
stroke
do
i
do
said
tony
i
had
something
to
drink
is
that
water
boiling
yet
it
was
at
exactly
a
quarter
past
two
that
the
work
was
finished
again
said
charteris
looking
with
pride
at
the
piles
of
stacked
on
the
table
jelly
business
makes
one
beastly
sticky
i
think
we
keep
to
print
in
future
and
they
did
out
of
the
twenty
or
more
numbers
of
glow
published
during
charteris
stay
at
school
that
was
the
only
one
that
did
not
come
from
the
press
readers
who
have
themselves
tried
jellygraphing
will
sympathize
it
is
a
curious
operation
but
most
people
will
find
one
trial
quite
sufficient
that
special
number
however
reached
a
record
circulation
the
school
had
got
its
by
the
time
it
appeared
and
wanted
something
to
read
in
the
train
jim
pound
was
raised
with
ease
charteris
took
it
round
to
him
at
the
babe
house
together
with
a
copy
of
the
special
number
jove
said
jim
awfully
do
you
know
i
absolutely
forgotten
all
about
glow
i
was
to
have
written
something
for
this
number
was
i
and
considering
the
circumstances
that
remark
as
charteris
was
at
some
pains
to
explain
to
him
at
the
time
contained
when
you
came
to
analyse
it
more
cynical
immorality
to
the
cubic
foot
than
any
other
remarks
he
charteris
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
passes
out
of
the
realm
of
the
merely
impudent
he
said
with
a
happy
recollection
of
a
certain
favourite
author
of
his
soars
into
the
boundless
empyrean
of
pure
cheek
