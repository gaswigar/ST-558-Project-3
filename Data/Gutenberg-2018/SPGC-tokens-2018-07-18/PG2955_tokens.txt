slight
misfortunes
compel
me
to
leave
venice
my
adventures
in
milan
and
mantua
on
low
sunday
charles
paid
us
a
visit
with
his
lovely
wife
who
seemed
totally
indifferent
to
what
christine
used
to
be
her
hair
dressed
with
powder
did
not
please
me
as
well
as
the
raven
black
of
her
beautiful
locks
and
her
fashionable
town
attire
did
not
in
my
eyes
suit
her
as
well
as
her
rich
country
dress
but
the
countenances
of
husband
and
wife
bore
the
stamp
of
happiness
charles
reproached
me
in
a
friendly
manner
because
i
had
not
called
once
upon
them
and
in
order
to
atone
for
my
apparent
negligence
i
went
to
see
them
the
next
day
with
dandolo
charles
told
me
that
his
wife
was
idolized
by
his
aunt
and
his
sister
who
had
become
her
bosom
friend
that
she
was
kind
affectionate
unassuming
and
of
a
disposition
which
enforced
affection
i
was
no
less
pleased
with
this
favourable
state
of
things
than
with
the
facility
with
which
christine
was
learning
the
venetian
dialect
when
dandolo
and
i
called
at
their
house
charles
was
not
at
home
christine
was
alone
with
his
two
relatives
the
most
friendly
welcome
was
proffered
to
us
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
the
aunt
praised
the
progress
made
by
christine
in
her
writing
very
highly
and
asked
her
to
let
me
see
her
i
followed
her
to
the
next
room
where
she
told
me
that
she
was
very
happy
that
every
day
she
discovered
new
virtues
in
her
husband
he
had
told
her
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
suspicion
of
displeasure
that
he
knew
that
we
had
spent
two
days
together
in
treviso
and
that
he
had
laughed
at
the
fool
who
had
given
him
that
piece
of
information
in
the
hope
of
raising
a
cloud
in
the
heaven
of
their
felicity
charles
was
truly
endowed
with
all
the
virtues
with
all
the
noble
qualities
of
an
honest
and
distinguished
man
years
afterwards
i
happened
to
require
the
assistance
of
his
purse
and
found
him
my
true
friend
i
never
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
his
house
and
he
appreciated
my
delicacy
he
died
a
few
months
before
my
last
departure
from
venice
leaving
his
widow
in
easy
circumstances
and
three
sons
all
with
good
positions
who
may
for
what
i
know
be
still
living
with
their
mother
in
june
i
went
to
the
fair
at
padua
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
man
of
my
own
age
who
was
then
studying
mathematics
under
the
celebrated
professor
succi
his
name
was
tognolo
but
thinking
it
did
not
sound
well
he
changed
it
for
that
of
fabris
he
became
in
after
years
comte
de
fabris
under
joseph
and
died
governor
of
transylvania
this
man
who
owed
his
high
fortune
to
his
talents
would
perhaps
have
lived
and
died
unknown
if
he
had
kept
his
name
of
tognolo
a
truly
vulgar
one
he
was
from
uderzo
a
large
village
of
the
venetian
friuli
he
had
a
brother
in
the
church
a
man
of
parts
and
a
great
gamester
who
having
a
deep
knowledge
of
the
world
had
taken
the
name
of
fabris
and
the
younger
brother
had
to
assume
it
likewise
soon
afterwards
he
bought
an
estate
with
the
title
of
count
became
a
venetian
nobleman
and
his
origin
as
a
country
bumpkin
was
forgotten
if
he
had
kept
his
name
of
tognolo
it
would
have
injured
him
for
he
could
not
have
pronounced
it
without
reminding
his
hearers
of
what
is
called
by
the
most
contemptible
of
prejudices
low
extraction
and
the
privileged
class
through
an
absurd
error
does
not
admit
the
possibility
of
a
peasant
having
talent
or
genius
no
doubt
a
time
will
come
when
society
more
enlightened
and
therefore
more
reasonable
will
acknowledge
that
noble
feelings
honour
and
heroism
can
be
found
in
every
condition
of
life
as
easily
as
in
a
class
the
blood
of
which
is
not
always
exempt
from
the
taint
of
a
misalliance
the
new
count
while
he
allowed
others
to
forget
his
origin
was
too
wise
to
forget
it
himself
and
in
legal
documents
he
always
signed
his
family
name
as
well
as
the
one
he
had
adopted
his
brother
had
offered
him
two
ways
to
win
fortune
in
the
world
leaving
him
perfectly
free
in
his
choice
both
required
an
expenditure
of
one
thousand
sequins
but
the
abbe
had
put
the
amount
aside
for
that
purpose
my
friend
had
to
choose
between
the
sword
of
mars
and
the
bird
of
minerva
the
abbe
knew
that
he
could
purchase
for
his
brother
a
company
in
the
army
of
his
imperial
and
apostolic
majesty
or
obtain
for
him
a
professorship
at
the
university
of
padua
for
money
can
do
everything
but
my
friend
who
was
gifted
with
noble
feelings
and
good
sense
knew
that
in
either
profession
talents
and
knowledge
were
essentials
and
before
making
a
choice
he
was
applying
himself
with
great
success
to
the
study
of
mathematics
he
ultimately
decided
upon
the
military
profession
thus
imitating
achilles
who
preferred
the
sword
to
the
distaff
and
he
paid
for
it
with
his
life
like
the
son
of
peleus
though
not
so
young
and
not
through
a
wound
inflicted
by
an
arrow
but
from
the
plague
which
he
caught
in
the
unhappy
country
in
which
the
indolence
of
europe
allows
the
turks
to
perpetuate
that
fearful
disease
the
distinguished
appearance
the
noble
sentiments
the
great
knowledge
and
the
talents
of
fabris
would
have
been
turned
into
ridicule
in
a
man
called
tognolo
for
such
is
the
force
of
prejudices
particularly
of
those
which
have
no
ground
to
rest
upon
that
an
name
is
degrading
in
this
our
stupid
society
my
opinion
is
that
men
who
have
an
name
or
one
which
presents
an
indecent
or
ridiculous
idea
are
right
in
changing
it
if
they
intend
to
win
honour
fame
and
fortune
either
in
arts
or
sciences
no
one
can
reasonably
deny
them
that
right
provided
the
name
they
assume
belongs
to
nobody
the
alphabet
is
general
property
and
everyone
has
the
right
to
use
it
for
the
creation
of
a
word
forming
an
appellative
sound
but
he
must
truly
create
it
voltaire
in
spite
of
his
genius
would
not
perhaps
have
reached
posterity
under
his
name
of
arouet
especially
amongst
the
french
who
always
give
way
so
easily
to
their
keen
sense
of
ridicule
and
equivocation
how
could
they
have
imagined
that
a
writer
rouet
could
be
a
man
of
genius
and
would
he
have
attained
his
high
fame
his
universal
reputation
if
he
had
been
satisfied
with
his
name
of
le
rond
or
allround
what
would
have
become
of
metastasio
under
his
true
name
of
trapasso
what
impression
would
melanchthon
have
made
with
his
name
of
schwarzerd
would
he
then
have
dared
to
raise
the
voice
of
a
moralist
philosopher
of
a
reformer
of
the
eucharist
and
so
many
other
holy
things
would
not
de
beauharnais
have
caused
some
persons
to
laugh
and
others
to
blush
if
he
had
kept
his
name
of
beauvit
even
if
the
first
founder
of
his
family
had
been
indebted
for
his
fortune
to
the
fine
quality
expressed
by
that
name
would
the
bourbeux
have
made
as
good
a
figure
on
the
throne
as
the
bourbons
i
think
that
king
poniatowski
ought
to
have
abdicated
the
name
of
augustus
which
he
had
taken
at
the
time
of
his
accession
to
the
throne
when
he
abdicated
royalty
the
coleoni
of
bergamo
however
would
find
it
rather
difficult
to
change
their
name
because
they
would
be
compelled
at
the
same
time
to
change
their
coat
of
arms
the
two
generative
glands
and
thus
to
annihilate
the
glory
of
their
ancestor
the
hero
bartholomeo
towards
the
end
of
autumn
my
friend
fabris
introduced
me
to
a
family
in
the
midst
of
which
the
mind
and
the
heart
could
find
delicious
food
that
family
resided
in
the
country
on
the
road
to
zero
lovemaking
and
practical
jokes
were
the
order
of
the
day
some
of
those
jokes
were
rather
severe
ones
but
the
order
of
the
day
was
never
to
get
angry
and
to
laugh
at
everything
for
one
was
to
take
every
jest
pleasantly
or
be
thought
a
bore
bedsteads
would
at
night
tumble
down
under
their
occupants
ghosts
were
personated
diuretic
pills
or
were
given
to
young
ladies
as
well
as
comfits
who
produced
certain
winds
rising
from
the
netherlands
and
impossible
to
keep
under
control
these
jokes
would
sometimes
go
rather
too
far
but
such
was
the
spirit
animating
all
the
members
of
that
circle
they
would
laugh
i
was
not
less
inured
than
the
others
to
the
war
of
offence
and
defence
but
at
last
there
was
such
a
bitter
joke
played
upon
me
that
it
suggested
to
me
another
the
fatal
consequences
of
which
put
a
stop
to
the
mania
by
which
we
were
all
possessed
we
were
in
the
habit
of
walking
to
a
farm
which
was
about
half
a
league
distant
by
the
road
but
the
distance
could
be
reduced
by
half
by
going
over
a
deep
and
miry
ditch
across
which
a
narrow
plank
was
thrown
and
i
always
insisted
upon
going
that
way
in
spite
of
the
fright
of
the
ladies
who
always
trembled
on
the
narrow
bridge
although
i
never
failed
to
cross
the
first
and
to
offer
my
hand
to
help
them
over
one
fine
day
i
crossed
first
so
as
to
give
them
courage
but
suddenly
when
i
reached
the
middle
of
the
plank
it
gave
way
under
me
and
there
i
was
in
the
ditch
up
to
the
chin
in
stinking
mud
and
in
spite
of
my
inward
rage
obliged
according
to
the
general
understanding
to
join
in
the
merry
laughter
of
all
my
companions
but
the
merriment
did
not
last
long
for
the
joke
was
too
bad
and
everyone
declared
it
to
be
so
some
peasants
were
called
to
the
rescue
and
with
much
difficulty
they
dragged
me
out
in
the
most
awful
state
an
entirely
new
dress
embroidered
with
spangles
my
silk
stockings
my
lace
everything
was
of
course
spoiled
but
not
minding
it
i
laughed
more
heartily
that
anybody
else
although
i
had
already
made
an
inward
vow
to
have
the
most
cruel
revenge
in
order
to
know
the
author
of
that
bitter
joke
i
had
only
to
appear
calm
and
indifferent
about
it
it
was
evident
that
the
plank
had
been
purposely
sawn
i
was
taken
back
to
the
house
a
shirt
a
coat
a
complete
costume
were
lent
me
for
i
had
come
that
time
only
for
hours
and
had
not
brought
anything
with
me
i
went
to
the
city
the
next
morning
and
towards
the
evening
i
returned
to
the
gay
company
fabris
who
had
been
as
angry
as
myself
observed
to
me
that
the
perpetrator
of
the
joke
evidently
felt
his
guilt
because
he
took
good
care
not
to
discover
himself
but
i
unveiled
the
mystery
by
promising
one
sequin
to
a
peasant
woman
if
she
could
find
out
who
had
sawn
the
plank
she
contrived
to
discover
the
young
man
who
had
done
the
work
i
called
on
him
and
the
offer
of
a
sequin
together
with
my
threats
compelled
him
to
confess
that
he
had
been
paid
for
his
work
by
signor
demetrio
a
greek
dealer
in
spices
a
good
and
amiable
man
of
between
and
fifty
years
on
whom
i
never
played
any
trick
except
in
the
case
of
a
pretty
young
servant
girl
whom
he
was
courting
and
whom
i
had
juggled
from
him
satisfied
with
my
discovery
i
was
racking
my
brain
to
invent
a
good
practical
joke
but
to
obtain
complete
revenge
it
was
necessary
that
my
trick
should
prove
worse
than
the
one
he
had
played
upon
me
unfortunately
my
imagination
was
at
bay
i
could
not
find
anything
a
funeral
put
an
end
to
my
difficulties
armed
with
my
i
went
alone
to
the
cemetery
a
little
after
midnight
and
opening
the
grave
of
the
dead
man
who
had
been
buried
that
very
day
i
cut
off
one
of
the
arms
near
the
shoulder
not
without
some
trouble
and
after
i
had
the
corpse
i
returned
to
my
room
with
the
arm
of
the
defunct
the
next
day
when
supper
was
over
i
left
the
table
and
retired
to
my
chamber
as
if
i
intended
to
go
to
bed
but
taking
the
arm
with
me
i
hid
myself
under
demetrio
bed
a
short
time
after
the
greek
comes
in
undresses
himself
put
his
light
out
and
lies
down
i
give
him
time
to
fall
nearly
asleep
then
placing
myself
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
pull
away
the
clothes
little
by
little
until
he
is
half
naked
he
laughs
and
calls
out
whoever
you
may
be
go
away
and
let
me
sleep
quietly
for
i
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
he
covers
himself
again
and
composes
himself
to
sleep
i
wait
five
or
six
minutes
and
pull
again
at
the
bedclothes
but
when
he
tries
to
draw
up
the
sheet
saying
that
he
does
not
care
for
ghosts
i
oppose
some
resistance
he
sits
up
so
as
to
catch
the
hand
which
is
pulling
at
the
clothes
and
i
take
care
that
he
should
get
hold
of
the
dead
hand
confident
that
he
has
caught
the
man
or
the
woman
who
was
playing
the
trick
he
pulls
it
towards
him
laughing
all
the
time
i
keep
tight
hold
of
the
arm
for
a
few
instants
and
then
let
it
go
suddenly
the
greek
falls
back
on
his
pillow
without
uttering
a
single
word
the
trick
was
played
i
leave
the
room
without
any
noise
and
reaching
my
chamber
go
to
bed
i
was
fast
asleep
when
towards
morning
i
was
awoke
by
persons
going
about
and
not
understanding
why
they
should
be
up
so
early
i
got
up
the
first
person
i
met
the
mistress
of
the
house
told
me
that
i
had
played
an
abominable
joke
i
what
have
i
done
demetrio
is
dying
have
i
killed
him
she
went
away
without
answering
me
i
dressed
myself
rather
frightened
i
confess
but
determined
upon
pleading
complete
ignorance
of
everything
and
i
proceeded
to
demetrio
room
and
i
was
confronted
with
countenances
and
bitter
reproaches
i
found
all
the
guests
around
him
i
protested
my
innocence
but
everyone
smiled
the
archpriest
and
the
beadle
who
had
just
arrived
would
not
bury
the
arm
which
was
lying
there
and
they
told
me
that
i
had
been
guilty
of
a
great
crime
i
am
astonished
reverend
sir
i
said
to
the
priest
at
the
hasty
judgment
which
is
thus
passed
upon
me
when
there
is
no
proof
to
condemn
me
you
have
done
it
exclaimed
all
the
guests
you
alone
are
capable
of
such
an
abomination
it
is
just
like
you
no
one
but
you
would
have
dared
to
do
such
a
thing
i
am
compelled
said
the
archpriest
to
draw
up
an
official
report
as
you
please
i
have
not
the
slightest
objection
i
answered
i
have
nothing
to
fear
and
i
left
the
room
i
continued
to
take
it
coolly
and
at
the
i
was
informed
that
demetrio
had
been
bled
that
he
had
recovered
the
use
of
his
eyes
but
not
of
his
tongue
or
of
his
limbs
the
next
day
he
could
speak
and
i
heard
after
i
had
taken
leave
of
the
family
that
he
was
stupid
and
spasmodic
the
poor
man
remained
in
that
painful
state
for
the
rest
of
his
life
i
felt
deeply
grieved
but
i
had
not
intended
to
injure
him
so
badly
i
thought
that
the
trick
he
had
played
upon
me
might
have
cost
my
life
and
i
could
not
help
deriving
consolation
from
that
idea
on
the
same
day
the
archpriest
made
up
his
mind
to
have
the
arm
buried
and
to
send
a
formal
denunciation
against
me
to
the
episcopal
chancellorship
of
treviso
annoyed
at
the
reproaches
which
i
received
on
all
sides
i
returned
to
venice
a
fortnight
afterwards
i
was
summoned
to
appear
before
the
alla
blasfemia
i
begged
barbaro
to
enquire
the
cause
of
the
aforesaid
summons
for
it
was
a
formidable
court
i
was
surprised
at
the
proceedings
being
taken
against
me
as
if
there
had
been
a
certainty
of
my
having
desecrated
a
grave
whilst
there
could
be
nothing
but
suspicion
but
i
was
mistaken
the
summons
was
not
relating
to
that
affair
barbaro
informed
me
in
the
evening
that
a
woman
had
brought
a
complaint
against
me
for
having
violated
her
daughter
she
stated
in
her
complaint
that
having
decoyed
her
child
to
the
zuecca
i
had
abused
her
by
violence
and
she
adduced
as
a
proof
that
her
daughter
was
confined
to
her
bed
owing
to
the
bad
treatment
she
had
received
from
me
in
my
endeavours
to
ravish
her
it
was
one
of
those
complaints
which
are
often
made
in
order
to
give
trouble
and
to
cause
expense
even
against
innocent
persons
i
was
innocent
of
violation
but
it
was
quite
true
that
i
had
given
the
girl
a
sound
thrashing
i
prepared
my
defence
and
begged
barbaro
to
deliver
it
to
the
magistrate
secretary
declaration
i
hereby
declare
that
on
such
a
day
having
met
the
woman
with
her
daughter
i
accosted
them
and
offered
to
give
them
some
refreshments
at
a
near
by
that
the
daughter
refused
to
accept
my
caresses
and
that
the
mother
said
to
me
my
daughter
is
yet
a
virgin
and
she
is
quite
right
not
to
lose
her
maidenhood
without
making
a
good
profit
by
it
if
so
i
answered
i
will
give
you
ten
sequins
for
her
virginity
you
may
judge
for
yourself
said
the
mother
having
assured
myself
of
the
fact
by
the
assistance
of
the
sense
of
feeling
and
having
ascertained
that
it
might
be
true
i
told
the
mother
to
bring
the
girl
in
the
afternoon
to
the
zuecca
and
that
i
would
give
her
the
ten
sequins
my
offer
was
joyfully
accepted
the
mother
brought
her
daughter
to
me
she
received
the
money
and
leaving
us
together
in
the
garden
of
the
cross
she
went
away
when
i
tried
to
avail
myself
of
the
right
for
which
i
had
paid
the
girl
most
likely
trained
to
the
business
by
her
mother
contrived
to
prevent
me
at
first
the
game
amused
me
but
at
last
being
tired
of
it
i
told
her
to
have
done
she
answered
quietly
that
it
was
not
her
fault
if
i
was
not
able
to
do
what
i
wanted
vexed
and
annoyed
i
placed
her
in
such
a
position
that
she
found
herself
at
bay
but
making
a
violent
effort
she
managed
to
change
her
position
and
debarred
me
from
making
any
further
attempts
why
i
said
to
her
did
you
move
because
i
would
not
have
it
in
that
position
you
would
not
no
without
more
ado
i
got
hold
of
a
broomstick
and
gave
her
a
good
lesson
in
order
to
get
something
for
the
ten
sequins
which
i
had
been
foolish
enough
to
pay
in
advance
but
i
have
broken
none
of
her
limbs
and
i
took
care
to
apply
my
blows
only
on
her
posteriors
on
which
spot
i
have
no
doubt
that
all
the
marks
may
be
seen
in
the
evening
i
made
her
dress
herself
again
and
sent
her
back
in
a
boat
which
chanced
to
pass
and
she
was
landed
in
safety
the
mother
received
ten
sequins
the
daughter
has
kept
her
hateful
maidenhood
and
if
i
am
guilty
of
anything
it
is
only
of
having
given
a
thrashing
to
an
infamous
girl
the
pupil
of
a
still
more
infamous
mother
my
declaration
had
no
effect
the
magistrate
was
acquainted
with
the
girl
and
the
mother
laughed
at
having
duped
me
so
easily
i
was
summoned
but
did
not
appear
before
the
court
and
a
writ
was
on
the
point
of
being
issued
against
my
body
when
the
complaint
of
the
profanation
of
a
grave
was
filed
against
me
before
the
same
magistrate
it
would
have
been
less
serious
for
me
if
the
second
affair
had
been
carried
before
the
council
of
ten
because
one
court
might
have
saved
me
from
the
other
the
second
crime
which
after
all
was
only
a
joke
was
high
felony
in
the
eyes
of
the
clergy
and
a
great
deal
was
made
of
it
i
was
summoned
to
appear
within
hours
and
it
was
evident
that
i
would
be
arrested
immediately
afterwards
de
bragadin
who
always
gave
good
advice
told
me
that
the
best
way
to
avoid
the
threatening
storm
was
to
run
away
the
advice
was
certainly
wise
and
i
lost
no
time
in
getting
ready
i
have
never
left
venice
with
so
much
regret
as
i
did
then
for
i
had
some
pleasant
intrigues
on
hand
and
i
was
very
lucky
at
cards
my
three
friends
assured
me
that
within
one
year
at
the
furthest
the
cases
against
me
would
be
forgotten
and
in
venice
when
public
opinion
has
forgotten
anything
it
can
be
easily
arranged
i
left
venice
in
the
evening
and
the
next
day
i
slept
at
verona
two
days
afterwards
i
reached
mantua
i
was
alone
with
plenty
of
clothes
and
jewels
without
letters
of
introduction
but
with
a
purse
enjoying
excellent
health
and
my
years
in
mantua
i
ordered
an
excellent
dinner
the
very
first
thing
one
ought
to
do
at
a
large
hotel
and
after
dinner
i
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
evening
after
i
had
seen
the
and
the
places
of
resort
i
went
to
the
theatre
and
i
was
delighted
to
see
marina
appear
on
the
stage
as
a
comic
dancer
amid
the
greatest
applause
which
she
deserved
for
she
danced
beautifully
she
was
tall
handsome
very
well
made
and
very
graceful
i
immediately
resolved
on
renewing
my
acquaintance
with
her
if
she
happened
to
be
free
and
after
the
opera
i
engaged
a
boy
to
take
me
to
her
house
she
had
just
sat
down
to
supper
with
someone
but
the
moment
she
saw
me
she
threw
her
napkin
down
and
flew
to
my
arms
i
returned
her
kisses
judging
by
her
warmth
that
her
guest
was
a
man
of
no
consequence
the
servant
without
waiting
for
orders
had
already
laid
a
plate
for
me
and
marina
invited
me
to
sit
down
near
her
i
felt
vexed
because
the
aforesaid
individual
had
not
risen
to
salute
me
and
before
i
accepted
marina
invitation
i
asked
her
who
the
gentleman
was
begging
her
to
introduce
me
this
gentleman
she
said
is
count
celi
of
rome
he
is
my
lover
i
congratulate
you
i
said
to
her
and
turning
towards
the
count
sir
i
added
do
not
be
angry
at
our
mutual
affection
marina
is
my
daughter
she
is
a
prostitute
true
said
marina
and
you
can
believe
the
count
for
he
is
my
procurer
at
those
words
the
brute
threw
his
knife
at
her
face
but
she
avoided
it
by
running
away
the
scoundrel
followed
her
but
i
drew
my
sword
and
said
stop
or
you
are
a
dead
man
i
immediately
asked
marina
to
order
her
servant
to
light
me
out
but
she
hastily
put
a
cloak
on
and
taking
my
arm
she
entreated
me
to
take
her
with
me
with
pleasure
i
said
the
count
then
invited
me
to
meet
him
alone
on
the
following
day
at
the
casino
of
pomi
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
very
well
sir
at
four
in
the
afternoon
i
answered
i
took
marina
to
my
inn
where
i
lodged
her
in
the
room
adjoining
mine
and
we
sat
down
to
supper
marina
seeing
that
i
was
thoughtful
said
are
you
sorry
to
have
saved
me
from
the
rage
of
that
brute
no
i
am
glad
to
have
done
so
but
tell
me
truly
who
and
what
he
is
he
is
a
gambler
by
profession
and
gives
himself
out
as
count
celi
i
made
his
acquaintance
here
he
courted
me
invited
me
to
supper
played
after
supper
and
having
won
a
large
sum
from
an
englishman
whom
he
had
decoyed
to
his
supper
by
telling
him
that
i
would
be
present
he
gave
me
fifty
guineas
saying
that
he
had
given
me
an
interest
in
his
bank
as
soon
as
i
had
become
his
mistress
he
insisted
upon
my
being
compliant
with
all
the
men
he
wanted
to
make
his
dupes
and
at
last
he
took
up
his
quarters
at
my
lodgings
the
welcome
i
gave
you
very
likely
vexed
him
and
you
know
the
rest
here
i
am
and
here
i
will
remain
until
my
departure
for
mantua
where
i
have
an
engagement
as
first
dancer
my
servant
will
bring
me
all
i
need
for
and
i
will
give
him
orders
to
move
all
my
luggage
i
will
not
see
that
scoundrel
any
more
i
will
be
only
yours
if
you
are
free
as
in
corfu
and
if
you
love
me
still
yes
my
dear
marina
i
do
love
you
but
if
you
wish
to
be
my
mistress
you
must
be
only
mine
oh
of
course
i
have
three
hundred
sequins
and
i
will
give
them
to
you
if
you
will
take
me
as
your
mistress
i
do
not
want
any
money
all
i
want
is
yourself
well
it
is
all
arranged
evening
we
shall
feel
more
comfortable
perhaps
you
are
thinking
of
a
duel
for
but
do
not
imagine
such
a
thing
dearest
i
know
that
man
he
is
an
arrant
coward
i
must
keep
my
engagement
with
him
i
know
that
but
he
will
not
keep
his
and
i
am
very
glad
of
it
changing
the
conversation
and
speaking
of
our
old
acquaintances
she
informed
me
that
she
had
quarreled
with
her
brother
petronio
that
her
sister
was
primadonna
in
genoa
and
that
bellino
therese
was
still
in
naples
where
she
continued
to
ruin
dukes
she
concluded
by
saying
i
am
the
most
unhappy
of
the
family
how
so
you
are
beautiful
and
you
have
become
an
excellent
dancer
do
not
be
so
prodigal
of
your
favours
and
you
can
not
fail
to
meet
with
a
man
who
will
take
care
of
your
fortune
to
be
sparing
of
my
favours
is
very
difficult
when
i
love
i
am
no
longer
mine
but
when
i
do
not
love
i
can
not
be
amiable
well
dearest
i
could
be
very
happy
with
you
dear
marina
i
am
not
wealthy
and
my
honour
would
not
allow
me
hold
your
tongue
i
understand
you
why
have
you
not
a
lady
maid
with
you
instead
of
a
male
servant
you
are
right
a
maid
would
look
more
respectable
but
my
servant
is
so
clever
and
so
faithful
i
can
guess
all
his
qualities
but
he
is
not
a
fit
servant
for
you
the
next
day
after
dinner
i
left
marina
getting
ready
for
the
theatre
and
having
put
everything
of
value
i
possessed
in
my
pocket
i
took
a
carriage
and
proceeded
to
the
casino
of
pomi
i
felt
confident
of
disabling
the
false
count
and
sent
the
carriage
away
i
was
conscious
of
being
guilty
of
great
folly
in
exposing
my
life
with
such
an
adversary
i
might
have
broken
my
engagement
with
him
without
implicating
my
honour
but
the
fact
is
that
i
felt
well
disposed
for
a
fight
and
as
i
was
certainly
in
the
right
i
thought
the
prospect
of
a
duel
very
delightful
a
visit
to
a
dancer
a
brute
professing
to
be
a
nobleman
who
insults
her
in
my
presence
who
wants
to
kill
her
who
allows
her
to
be
carried
off
in
his
very
teeth
and
whose
only
opposition
is
to
give
me
an
appointment
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
had
failed
to
come
i
should
have
given
him
the
right
to
call
me
a
coward
the
count
had
not
yet
arrived
i
entered
the
to
wait
for
him
i
met
a
frenchman
there
and
i
addressed
him
being
pleased
with
his
conversation
i
told
him
that
i
expected
the
arrival
of
a
man
and
that
as
my
honour
required
that
he
should
find
me
alone
i
would
feel
grateful
if
he
would
go
away
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
man
approaching
a
short
time
afterwards
i
saw
my
adversary
coming
along
but
with
a
second
i
then
told
the
frenchman
that
he
would
oblige
me
by
remaining
and
he
accepted
as
readily
as
if
i
had
invited
him
to
a
party
of
pleasure
the
count
came
in
with
his
follower
who
was
sporting
a
sword
at
least
forty
inches
long
and
had
all
the
look
of
a
i
advanced
towards
the
count
and
said
to
him
dryly
you
told
me
that
you
would
come
alone
my
friend
will
not
be
in
the
way
as
i
only
want
to
speak
to
you
if
i
had
known
that
i
would
not
have
gone
out
of
my
way
but
do
not
let
us
be
noisy
and
let
us
go
to
some
place
where
we
can
exchange
a
few
words
without
being
seen
follow
me
i
left
the
with
the
young
frenchman
who
being
well
acquainted
with
the
place
took
me
to
the
most
favourable
spot
and
we
waited
there
for
the
two
other
champions
who
were
walking
slowly
and
talking
together
when
they
were
within
ten
paces
i
drew
my
sword
and
called
upon
my
adversary
to
get
ready
my
frenchman
had
already
taken
out
his
sword
but
he
kept
it
under
his
arm
two
to
one
exclaimed
celi
send
your
friend
away
and
this
gentleman
will
go
likewise
at
all
events
your
friend
wears
a
sword
therefore
we
are
two
against
two
yes
said
the
frenchman
let
us
have
a
game
i
do
not
cross
swords
with
a
dancer
said
the
cutthroat
he
had
scarcely
uttered
those
words
when
my
friend
going
up
to
him
told
him
that
a
dancer
was
certainly
as
good
as
a
blackleg
and
gave
him
a
violent
bow
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
on
the
face
i
followed
his
example
with
celi
who
began
to
beat
a
retreat
and
said
that
he
only
wanted
to
tell
me
something
and
that
he
would
fight
afterwards
well
speak
you
know
me
and
i
do
not
know
you
tell
me
who
you
are
my
only
answer
was
to
resume
laying
my
sword
upon
the
scoundrel
while
the
frenchman
was
shewing
the
same
dexterity
upon
the
back
of
his
companion
but
the
two
cowards
took
to
their
heels
and
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
to
sheathe
our
weapons
thus
did
the
duel
end
in
a
manner
even
more
amusing
than
marina
herself
had
anticipated
my
brave
frenchman
was
expecting
someone
at
the
casino
i
left
him
after
inviting
him
to
supper
for
that
evening
after
the
opera
i
gave
him
the
name
which
i
had
assumed
for
my
journey
and
the
address
of
my
hotel
i
gave
marina
a
full
description
of
the
adventure
i
will
she
said
amuse
everybody
at
the
theatre
this
evening
with
the
story
of
your
meeting
but
that
which
pleases
me
most
is
that
if
your
second
is
really
a
dancer
he
can
be
no
other
than
baletti
who
is
engaged
with
me
for
the
mantua
theatre
i
stored
all
my
valuables
in
my
trunk
again
and
went
to
the
opera
where
i
saw
baletti
who
recognized
me
and
pointed
me
out
to
all
his
friends
to
whom
he
was
relating
the
adventure
he
joined
me
after
the
performance
and
accompanied
me
to
the
inn
marina
who
had
already
returned
came
to
my
room
as
soon
as
she
heard
my
voice
and
i
was
amused
at
the
surprise
of
the
amiable
frenchman
when
he
saw
the
young
artist
with
whom
he
had
engaged
to
dance
the
comic
parts
marina
although
an
excellent
dancer
did
not
like
the
serious
style
those
two
handsome
adepts
of
terpsichore
had
never
met
before
and
they
began
an
amorous
warfare
which
made
me
enjoy
my
supper
immensely
because
as
he
was
a
fellow
artist
marina
assumed
towards
baletti
a
tone
well
adapted
to
the
circumstances
and
very
different
to
her
usual
manner
with
other
men
she
shone
with
wit
and
beauty
that
evening
and
was
in
an
excellent
temper
for
she
had
been
much
applauded
by
the
public
the
true
version
of
the
celi
business
being
already
well
known
the
theatre
was
to
be
open
only
for
ten
more
nights
and
as
marina
wished
to
leave
milan
immediately
after
the
last
performance
we
decided
on
travelling
together
in
the
mean
time
i
invited
baletti
it
was
an
italian
name
which
he
had
adopted
for
the
stage
to
be
our
guest
during
the
remainder
of
our
stay
in
milan
the
friendship
between
us
had
a
great
influence
upon
all
the
subsequent
events
of
my
life
as
the
reader
will
see
in
these
memoirs
he
had
great
talent
as
a
dancer
but
that
was
the
least
of
his
excellent
qualities
he
was
honest
his
feelings
were
noble
he
had
studied
much
and
he
had
received
the
best
education
that
could
be
given
in
those
days
in
france
to
a
nobleman
on
the
third
day
i
saw
plainly
that
marina
wished
to
make
a
conquest
of
her
colleague
and
feeling
what
great
advantage
might
accrue
to
her
from
it
i
resolved
on
helping
her
she
had
a
for
two
persons
and
i
easily
persuaded
her
to
take
baletti
with
her
saying
that
i
wished
to
arrive
alone
in
mantua
for
several
reasons
which
i
could
not
confide
to
her
the
fact
was
that
if
i
had
arrived
with
her
people
would
have
naturally
supposed
that
i
was
her
lover
and
i
wished
to
avoid
that
baletti
was
delighted
with
the
proposal
he
insisted
upon
paying
his
share
of
the
expenses
but
marina
would
not
hear
of
it
the
reasons
alleged
by
the
young
man
for
paying
his
own
expenses
were
excellent
ones
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
prevailed
upon
him
to
accept
marina
offer
but
i
ultimately
succeeded
i
promised
to
wait
for
them
on
the
road
so
as
to
take
dinner
and
supper
together
and
on
the
day
appointed
for
our
departure
i
left
milan
one
hour
before
them
reaching
the
city
of
cremona
very
early
where
we
intended
to
sleep
i
took
a
walk
about
the
streets
and
finding
a
i
went
in
i
made
there
the
acquaintance
of
a
french
officer
and
we
left
the
together
to
take
a
short
ramble
a
very
pretty
woman
happened
to
pass
in
a
carriage
and
my
companion
stopped
her
to
say
a
few
words
their
conversation
was
soon
over
and
the
officer
joined
me
again
who
is
that
lovely
lady
i
enquired
she
is
a
truly
charming
woman
and
i
can
tell
you
an
anecdote
about
her
worthy
of
being
transmitted
to
posterity
you
need
not
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
exaggerate
for
the
adventure
is
known
to
everybody
in
cremona
the
charming
woman
whom
you
have
just
seen
is
gifted
with
wit
greater
even
than
her
beauty
and
here
is
a
specimen
of
it
a
young
officer
one
amongst
many
military
men
who
were
courting
her
when
marshal
de
richelieu
was
commanding
in
genoa
boasted
of
being
treated
by
her
with
more
favour
than
all
the
others
and
one
day
in
the
very
where
we
met
he
advised
a
brother
officer
not
to
lose
his
time
in
courting
her
because
he
had
no
chance
whatever
of
obtaining
any
favour
dear
fellow
said
the
other
officer
have
a
much
better
right
to
give
you
that
piece
of
advice
for
i
have
already
obtained
from
her
everything
which
can
be
granted
to
a
lover
am
certain
that
you
are
telling
a
lie
exclaimed
the
young
man
i
request
you
to
follow
me
out
willingly
said
the
indiscreet
swain
what
is
the
good
of
ascertaining
the
truth
through
a
duel
and
of
cutting
our
throats
when
i
can
make
the
lady
herself
certify
the
fact
in
your
presence
bet
louis
that
it
is
all
untrue
said
the
incredulous
officer
accept
your
bet
let
us
go
the
two
contending
parties
proceeded
together
towards
the
dwelling
of
the
lady
whom
you
saw
just
now
who
was
to
name
the
winner
of
the
louis
they
found
her
in
her
gentlemen
she
said
lucky
wind
has
brought
you
here
together
at
this
hour
is
a
bet
madam
answered
the
unbelieving
officer
you
alone
can
be
the
umpire
in
our
quarrel
this
gentleman
has
been
boasting
of
having
obtained
from
you
everything
a
woman
can
grant
to
the
most
favoured
lover
i
have
given
him
the
lie
in
the
most
impressive
manner
and
a
duel
was
to
ensue
when
he
offered
to
have
the
truth
of
his
boast
certified
by
you
i
have
bet
louis
that
you
would
not
admit
it
and
he
has
taken
my
bet
now
madam
you
can
say
which
of
us
two
is
right
you
have
lost
sir
she
said
to
him
now
i
beg
both
of
you
to
quit
my
house
and
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
if
you
ever
dare
to
shew
your
faces
here
again
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
the
two
heedless
fellows
went
away
dreadfully
mortified
the
unbeliever
paid
the
bet
but
he
was
deeply
vexed
called
the
other
a
coxcomb
and
a
week
afterwards
killed
him
in
a
duel
since
that
time
the
lady
goes
to
the
casino
and
continues
to
mix
in
society
but
does
not
see
company
at
her
own
house
and
lives
in
perfect
accord
with
her
husband
how
did
the
husband
take
it
all
quite
well
and
like
an
intelligent
sensible
man
he
said
that
if
his
wife
had
acted
differently
he
would
have
applied
for
a
divorce
because
in
that
case
no
one
would
have
entertained
a
doubt
of
her
being
guilty
that
husband
is
indeed
a
sensible
fellow
it
is
certain
that
if
his
wife
had
given
the
lie
to
the
indiscreet
officer
he
would
have
paid
the
bet
but
he
would
have
stood
by
what
he
had
said
and
everybody
would
have
believed
him
by
declaring
him
the
winner
of
the
bet
she
has
cut
the
matter
short
and
she
has
avoided
a
judgment
by
which
she
would
have
been
dishonoured
the
inconsiderate
boaster
was
guilty
of
a
double
mistake
for
which
he
paid
the
penalty
of
his
life
but
his
adversary
was
as
much
wanting
in
delicacy
for
in
such
matters
men
do
not
venture
upon
betting
if
the
one
who
says
yes
is
imprudent
the
one
who
says
no
is
a
dupe
i
like
the
lady
presence
of
mind
but
what
sentence
would
you
pass
on
her
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
and
it
has
been
the
verdict
of
the
public
likewise
for
she
has
since
been
treated
even
better
than
before
the
affair
you
will
see
if
you
go
to
the
casino
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
introduce
you
to
her
i
invited
the
officer
to
sup
with
us
and
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
after
he
had
gone
i
remarked
with
pleasure
that
marina
was
capable
of
observing
the
rules
of
propriety
she
had
taken
a
bedroom
to
herself
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
her
respectable
when
i
arrived
in
mantua
i
put
up
at
mark
hotel
marina
to
whom
i
had
given
a
notice
that
my
intention
was
to
call
on
her
but
seldom
took
up
her
abode
in
the
house
assigned
to
her
by
the
theatrical
manager
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
as
i
was
walking
about
i
went
into
a
bookseller
shop
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
any
new
work
out
i
remained
there
without
perceiving
that
the
night
had
come
and
on
being
told
that
the
shop
was
going
to
be
closed
i
went
out
i
had
only
gone
a
few
yards
when
i
was
arrested
by
a
patrol
the
officer
of
which
told
me
that
as
i
had
no
lantern
and
as
eight
had
struck
his
duty
was
to
take
me
to
the
guardhouse
it
was
in
vain
that
i
observed
that
having
arrived
only
in
the
afternoon
i
could
not
know
that
order
of
the
police
i
was
compelled
to
follow
him
when
we
reached
the
guardhouse
the
officer
of
the
patrol
introduced
me
to
his
captain
a
tall
young
man
who
received
me
in
the
most
cheerful
manner
i
begged
him
to
let
me
return
to
my
hotel
as
i
needed
rest
after
my
journey
he
laughed
and
answered
no
indeed
i
want
you
to
spend
a
joyous
night
with
me
and
in
good
company
he
told
the
officer
to
give
me
back
my
sword
and
addressing
me
again
he
said
i
only
consider
you
my
dear
sir
as
my
friend
and
guest
i
could
not
help
being
amused
at
such
a
novel
mode
of
invitation
and
i
accepted
it
he
gave
some
orders
to
a
german
soldier
and
soon
afterwards
the
table
was
laid
out
for
four
persons
the
two
other
officers
joined
us
and
we
had
a
very
gay
supper
when
the
desert
had
been
served
the
company
was
increased
by
the
arrival
of
two
disgusting
dissolute
females
a
green
cloth
was
spread
over
the
table
and
one
of
the
officers
began
a
faro
bank
i
punted
so
as
not
to
appear
unwilling
to
join
the
game
and
after
losing
a
few
sequins
i
went
out
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
for
we
had
drunk
freely
one
of
the
two
females
followed
me
teased
me
and
finally
contrived
in
spite
of
myself
to
make
me
a
present
which
condemned
me
to
a
regimen
of
six
weeks
after
that
fine
exploit
i
went
in
again
a
young
and
pleasant
officer
who
had
lost
some
fifteen
or
twenty
sequins
was
swearing
like
a
trooper
because
the
banker
had
pocketed
his
money
and
was
going
the
young
officer
had
a
great
deal
of
gold
before
him
on
the
table
and
he
contended
that
the
banker
ought
to
have
warned
him
that
it
would
be
the
last
game
sir
i
said
to
him
politely
you
are
in
the
wrong
for
faro
is
the
freest
of
games
why
do
you
not
take
the
bank
yourself
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
and
these
gentlemen
do
not
punt
high
enough
for
me
but
if
that
sort
of
thing
amuses
you
take
the
bank
and
i
will
punt
captain
i
said
will
you
take
a
fourth
share
in
my
bank
willingly
gentlemen
i
beg
you
to
give
notice
that
i
will
lay
the
cards
down
after
six
games
i
asked
for
new
packs
of
cards
and
put
three
hundred
sequins
on
the
table
the
captain
wrote
on
the
back
of
a
card
good
for
a
hundred
sequins
and
placing
it
with
my
gold
i
began
my
bank
the
young
officer
was
delighted
and
said
to
me
your
bank
might
be
defunct
before
the
end
of
the
sixth
game
i
did
not
answer
and
the
play
went
on
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
game
my
bank
was
in
the
pangs
of
death
the
young
officer
was
in
high
glee
i
rather
astonished
him
by
telling
him
that
i
was
glad
to
lose
for
i
thought
him
a
much
more
agreeable
companion
when
he
was
winning
there
are
some
civilities
which
very
likely
prove
unlucky
for
those
to
whom
they
are
addressed
and
it
turned
out
so
in
this
case
for
my
compliment
turned
his
brain
during
the
fifth
game
a
run
of
adverse
cards
made
him
lose
all
he
had
won
and
as
he
tried
to
do
violence
to
dame
fortune
in
the
sixth
round
he
lost
every
sequin
he
had
sir
he
said
to
me
you
have
been
very
lucky
but
i
hope
you
will
give
me
my
revenge
it
would
be
with
the
greatest
pleasure
sir
but
i
never
play
except
when
i
am
under
arrest
i
counted
my
money
and
found
that
i
had
wan
two
hundred
and
fifty
sequins
besides
a
debt
of
fifty
sequins
due
by
an
officer
who
played
on
trust
which
captain
took
on
his
own
account
i
completed
his
share
and
at
he
allowed
me
to
go
away
as
soon
as
i
got
to
my
hotel
i
went
to
bed
and
when
i
awoke
i
had
a
visit
from
captain
laurent
the
officer
who
had
played
on
trust
thinking
that
his
object
was
to
pay
me
what
he
had
lost
i
told
him
that
had
taken
his
debt
on
himself
but
he
answered
than
he
had
only
called
for
the
purpose
of
begging
of
me
a
loan
of
six
sequins
on
his
note
of
hand
by
which
he
would
pledge
his
honour
to
repay
me
within
one
week
i
gave
him
the
money
and
he
begged
that
the
matter
might
remain
between
us
i
promise
it
i
said
to
him
but
do
not
break
your
word
the
next
day
i
was
ill
and
the
reader
is
aware
of
the
nature
of
my
illness
i
immediately
placed
myself
under
a
proper
course
of
diet
however
unpleasant
it
was
at
my
age
but
i
kept
to
my
system
and
it
cured
me
rapidly
three
or
four
days
afterwards
captain
called
on
me
and
when
i
told
him
the
nature
of
my
sickness
he
laughed
much
to
my
surprise
then
you
were
all
right
before
that
night
he
enquired
yes
my
health
was
excellent
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
lost
your
health
in
such
an
ugly
place
i
would
have
warned
you
if
i
had
thought
you
had
any
intentions
in
that
quarter
did
you
know
of
the
woman
having
zounds
did
i
not
it
is
only
a
week
since
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
very
same
place
myself
and
i
believe
the
creature
was
all
right
before
my
visit
then
i
have
to
thank
you
for
the
present
she
has
bestowed
upon
me
most
likely
but
it
is
only
a
trifle
and
you
can
easily
get
cured
if
you
care
to
take
the
trouble
what
do
you
not
try
to
cure
yourself
faith
no
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
to
follow
a
regular
diet
and
what
is
the
use
of
curing
such
a
trifling
inconvenience
when
i
am
certain
of
getting
it
again
in
a
fortnight
ten
times
in
my
life
i
have
had
that
patience
but
i
got
tired
of
it
and
for
the
last
two
years
i
have
resigned
myself
and
now
i
put
up
with
it
i
pity
you
for
a
man
like
you
would
have
great
success
in
love
i
do
not
care
a
fig
for
love
it
requires
cares
which
would
bother
me
much
more
than
the
slight
inconvenience
to
which
we
were
alluding
and
to
which
i
am
used
now
i
am
not
of
your
opinion
for
the
amorous
pleasure
is
insipid
when
love
does
not
throw
a
little
spice
in
it
do
you
think
for
instance
that
the
ugly
wretch
i
met
at
the
is
worth
what
i
now
suffer
on
her
account
of
course
not
and
that
is
why
i
am
sorry
for
you
if
i
had
known
i
could
have
introduced
you
to
something
better
the
very
best
in
that
line
is
not
worth
my
health
and
health
ought
to
be
sacrificed
only
for
love
oh
you
want
women
worthy
of
love
there
are
a
few
here
stop
with
us
for
some
time
and
when
you
are
cured
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
you
from
making
conquests
was
only
years
old
his
father
who
was
dead
had
been
a
general
and
the
beautiful
countess
borsati
was
his
sister
he
presented
me
to
the
countess
zanardi
nerli
still
more
lovely
than
his
sister
but
i
was
prudent
enough
not
to
burn
my
incense
before
either
of
them
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
everybody
could
guess
the
state
of
my
health
i
have
never
met
a
young
man
more
addicted
to
debauchery
than
i
have
often
spent
the
night
rambling
about
with
him
and
i
was
amazed
at
his
cynical
boldness
and
impudence
yet
he
was
noble
generous
brave
and
honourable
if
in
those
days
young
officers
were
often
guilty
of
so
much
immorality
of
so
many
vile
actions
it
was
not
so
much
their
fault
as
the
fault
of
the
privileges
which
they
enjoyed
through
custom
indulgence
or
party
spirit
here
is
an
example
one
day
having
drunk
rather
freely
rides
through
the
city
at
full
speed
a
poor
old
woman
who
was
crossing
the
street
has
no
time
to
avoid
him
she
falls
and
her
head
is
cut
open
by
the
horse
feet
places
himself
under
arrest
but
the
next
day
he
is
set
at
liberty
he
had
only
to
plead
that
it
was
an
accident
the
officer
laurent
not
having
called
upon
me
to
redeem
his
promisory
note
of
six
sequins
during
the
week
i
told
him
in
the
street
that
i
would
no
longer
consider
myself
bound
to
keep
the
affair
secret
instead
of
excusing
himself
he
said
i
do
not
care
the
answer
was
insulting
and
i
intended
to
compel
him
to
give
me
reparation
but
the
next
day
told
me
that
captain
laurent
had
gone
mad
and
had
been
locked
up
in
a
he
subsequently
recovered
his
reason
but
his
conduct
was
so
infamous
that
he
was
cashiered
who
was
as
brave
as
bayard
was
killed
a
few
years
afterwards
at
the
battle
of
prague
a
man
of
his
complexion
was
certain
to
fall
the
victim
of
mars
or
of
venus
he
might
be
alive
now
if
he
had
been
endowed
only
with
the
courage
of
the
fox
but
he
had
the
courage
of
the
lion
it
is
a
virtue
in
a
soldier
but
almost
a
fault
in
an
officer
those
who
brave
danger
with
a
full
knowledge
of
it
are
worthy
of
praise
but
those
who
do
not
realize
it
escape
only
by
a
miracle
and
without
any
merit
attaching
itself
to
them
yet
we
must
respect
those
great
warriors
for
their
unconquerable
courage
is
the
offspring
of
a
strong
soul
of
a
virtue
which
places
them
above
ordinary
mortals
whenever
i
think
of
prince
charles
de
ligne
i
can
not
restrain
my
tears
he
was
as
brave
as
achilles
but
achilles
was
invulnerable
he
would
be
alive
now
if
he
had
remembered
during
the
fight
that
he
was
mortal
who
are
they
that
having
known
him
have
not
shed
tears
in
his
memory
he
was
handsome
kind
polished
learned
a
lover
of
the
arts
cheerful
witty
in
his
conversation
a
pleasant
companion
and
a
man
of
perfect
equability
fatal
terrible
revolution
a
cannon
ball
took
him
from
his
friends
from
his
family
from
the
happiness
which
surrounded
him
the
prince
de
waldeck
has
also
paid
the
penalty
of
his
intrepidity
with
the
loss
of
one
arm
it
is
said
that
he
consoles
himself
for
that
loss
with
the
consciousness
that
with
the
remaining
one
he
can
yet
command
an
army
o
you
who
despise
life
tell
me
whether
that
contempt
of
life
renders
you
worthy
of
it
the
opera
opened
immediately
after
easter
and
i
was
present
at
every
performance
i
was
then
entirely
cured
and
had
resumed
my
usual
life
i
was
pleased
to
see
that
baletti
shewed
off
marina
to
the
best
advantage
i
never
visited
her
but
baletti
was
in
the
habit
of
breakfasting
with
me
almost
every
morning
he
had
often
mentioned
an
old
actress
who
had
left
the
stage
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
pretended
to
have
been
my
father
friend
one
day
i
took
a
fancy
to
call
upon
her
and
he
accompanied
me
to
her
house
i
saw
an
old
crone
whose
toilet
astonished
me
as
much
as
her
person
in
spite
of
her
wrinkles
her
face
was
plastered
with
red
and
white
and
her
eyebrows
were
indebted
to
india
ink
for
their
black
appearance
she
exposed
of
her
flabby
disgusting
bosom
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
her
false
set
of
teeth
she
wore
a
wig
which
fitted
very
badly
and
allowed
the
intrusion
of
a
few
gray
hairs
which
had
survived
the
havoc
of
time
her
shaking
hands
made
mine
quiver
when
she
pressed
them
she
diffused
a
perfume
of
amber
at
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
and
her
affected
mincing
manner
amused
and
sickened
me
at
the
same
time
her
dress
might
possibly
have
been
the
fashion
twenty
years
before
i
was
looking
with
dread
at
the
fearful
havoc
of
old
age
upon
a
face
which
before
merciless
time
had
blighted
it
had
evidently
been
handsome
but
what
amazed
me
was
the
childish
effrontery
with
which
this
specimen
of
womankind
was
still
waging
war
with
the
help
of
her
blasted
charms
baletti
who
feared
lest
my
too
visible
astonishment
should
vex
her
told
her
that
i
was
amazed
at
the
fact
that
the
beautiful
strawberry
which
bloomed
upon
her
chest
had
not
been
withered
by
the
hand
of
time
it
was
a
which
was
really
very
much
like
a
strawberry
it
is
that
mark
said
the
old
woman
simpering
which
gave
me
the
name
of
fragoletta
those
words
made
me
shudder
i
had
before
my
eyes
the
fatal
phantom
which
was
the
cause
of
my
existence
i
saw
the
woman
who
had
thirty
years
before
seduced
my
father
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
he
would
never
have
thought
of
leaving
his
father
house
and
would
never
have
engendered
me
in
the
womb
of
a
venetian
woman
i
have
never
been
of
the
opinion
of
the
old
author
who
says
vitam
vellet
si
daretur
scientibus
seeing
how
thoughtful
i
was
she
politely
enquired
my
name
from
baletti
for
he
had
presented
me
only
as
a
friend
and
without
having
given
her
notice
of
my
visit
when
he
told
her
that
my
name
was
casanova
she
was
extremely
surprised
yes
madam
i
said
i
am
the
son
of
gaetan
casanova
of
parma
heavens
and
earth
what
is
this
ah
my
friend
i
adored
your
father
he
was
jealous
without
cause
and
abandoned
me
had
he
not
done
so
you
would
have
been
my
son
allow
me
to
embrace
you
with
the
feelings
of
a
loving
mother
i
expected
as
much
and
for
fear
she
should
fall
i
went
to
her
received
her
kiss
and
abandoned
myself
to
her
tender
recollections
still
an
actress
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
pretending
to
weep
and
assuring
me
that
i
was
not
to
doubt
the
truth
of
what
she
said
although
she
added
i
do
not
look
an
old
woman
yet
the
only
fault
of
your
dear
father
she
continued
was
a
want
of
gratitude
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
passed
the
same
sentence
upon
the
son
for
in
spite
of
her
kind
invitation
i
never
paid
her
another
visit
my
purse
was
well
filled
and
as
i
did
not
care
for
mantua
i
resolved
on
going
to
naples
to
see
again
my
dear
therese
donna
lucrezia
palo
father
and
son
don
antonio
casanova
and
all
my
former
acquaintances
however
my
good
genius
did
not
approve
of
that
decision
for
i
was
not
allowed
to
carry
it
into
execution
i
should
have
left
mantua
three
days
later
had
i
not
gone
to
the
opera
that
night
i
lived
like
an
anchorite
during
my
two
months
stay
in
mantua
owing
to
the
folly
i
committed
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
i
played
only
that
time
and
then
i
had
been
lucky
my
slight
erotic
inconvenience
by
compelling
me
to
follow
the
diet
necessary
to
my
cure
most
likely
saved
me
from
greater
misfortunes
which
perhaps
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
avoid
chapter
xxi
my
journey
to
cesena
in
search
of
treasure
i
take
up
my
quarters
in
franzia
house
his
daughter
javotte
the
opera
was
nearly
over
when
i
was
accosted
by
a
young
man
who
abruptly
and
without
any
introduction
told
me
that
as
a
stranger
i
had
been
very
wrong
in
spending
two
months
in
mantua
without
paying
a
visit
to
the
natural
history
collection
belonging
to
his
father
don
antonio
capitani
commissary
and
prebendal
president
sir
i
answered
i
have
been
guilty
only
through
ignorance
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
call
for
me
at
my
hotel
morning
before
the
evening
i
shall
have
atoned
for
my
error
and
you
will
no
longer
have
the
right
to
address
me
the
same
reproach
the
son
of
the
prebendal
commissary
called
for
me
and
i
found
in
his
father
a
most
eccentric
whimsical
sort
of
man
the
curiosities
of
his
collection
consisted
of
his
family
tree
of
books
of
magic
relics
coins
which
he
believed
to
be
antediluvian
a
model
of
the
ark
taken
from
nature
at
the
time
when
noah
arrived
in
that
extraordinary
harbour
mount
ararat
in
armenia
he
load
several
medals
one
of
sesostris
another
of
semiramis
and
an
old
knife
of
a
queer
shape
covered
with
rust
besides
all
those
wonderful
treasures
he
possessed
but
under
lock
and
key
all
the
paraphernalia
of
freemasonry
pray
tell
me
i
said
to
him
what
relation
there
is
between
this
collection
and
natural
history
i
see
nothing
here
representing
the
three
kingdoms
what
you
do
not
see
the
antediluvian
kingdom
that
of
sesostris
and
that
of
semiramis
are
not
those
the
three
kingdoms
when
i
heard
that
answer
i
embraced
him
with
an
exclamation
of
delight
which
was
sarcastic
in
its
intent
but
which
he
took
for
admiration
and
he
at
once
unfolded
all
the
treasures
of
his
whimsical
knowledge
respecting
his
possessions
ending
with
the
rusty
blade
which
he
said
was
the
very
knife
with
which
saint
peter
cut
off
the
ear
of
malek
what
i
exclaimed
you
are
the
possessor
of
this
knife
and
you
are
not
as
rich
as
croesus
how
could
i
be
so
through
the
possession
of
the
knife
in
two
ways
in
the
first
place
you
could
obtain
possession
of
all
the
treasures
hidden
under
ground
in
the
states
of
the
church
yes
that
is
a
natural
consequence
because
peter
has
the
keys
in
the
second
place
you
might
sell
the
knife
to
the
pope
if
you
happen
to
possess
proof
of
its
authenticity
you
mean
the
parchment
of
course
i
have
it
do
you
think
i
would
have
bought
one
without
the
other
all
right
then
in
order
to
get
possession
of
that
knife
the
pope
would
i
have
no
doubt
make
a
cardinal
of
your
son
but
you
must
have
the
sheath
too
i
have
not
got
it
but
it
is
unnecessary
at
all
events
i
can
have
one
made
that
would
not
do
you
must
have
the
very
one
in
which
saint
peter
himself
sheathed
the
knife
when
god
said
gladium
tuum
in
vaginam
that
very
sheath
does
exist
and
it
is
now
in
the
hands
of
a
person
who
might
sell
it
to
you
at
a
reasonable
price
or
you
might
sell
him
your
knife
for
the
sheath
without
the
knife
is
of
no
use
to
him
just
as
the
knife
is
useless
to
you
without
the
sheath
how
much
would
it
cost
me
one
thousand
sequins
and
how
much
would
that
person
give
me
for
the
knife
one
thousand
sequins
for
one
has
as
much
value
as
the
other
the
commissary
greatly
astonished
looked
at
his
son
and
said
with
the
voice
of
a
judge
on
the
bench
well
son
would
you
ever
have
thought
that
i
would
be
offered
one
thousand
sequins
for
this
knife
he
then
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
of
it
an
old
piece
of
paper
which
he
placed
before
me
it
was
written
in
hebrew
and
a
facsimile
of
the
knife
was
drawn
on
it
i
pretended
to
be
lost
in
admiration
and
advised
him
very
strongly
to
purchase
the
sheath
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
buy
it
or
for
your
friend
to
purchase
the
knife
we
can
find
out
and
dig
up
the
treasures
together
not
at
all
the
rubric
says
in
the
most
forcible
manner
that
the
owner
of
the
blade
vaginam
shall
be
one
if
the
pope
were
in
possession
of
it
he
would
be
able
through
a
magical
operation
known
to
me
to
cut
off
one
of
the
ears
of
every
christian
king
who
might
be
thinking
of
encroaching
upon
the
rights
of
the
church
wonderful
indeed
but
it
is
very
true
for
it
is
said
in
the
gospel
that
saint
peter
did
cut
off
the
ear
of
somebody
yes
of
a
king
oh
no
not
of
a
king
of
a
king
i
tell
you
enquire
whether
malek
or
melek
does
not
mean
king
well
in
case
i
should
make
up
my
mind
to
sell
the
knife
who
would
give
me
the
thousand
sequins
i
would
one
half
cash
down
the
balance
of
five
hundred
in
a
letter
of
exchange
payable
one
month
after
date
ah
that
is
like
business
be
good
enough
to
accept
a
dish
of
macaroni
with
us
and
under
a
solemn
pledge
of
secrecy
we
will
discuss
this
important
affair
i
accepted
and
took
my
leave
firmly
resolved
on
keeping
up
the
joke
i
came
back
on
the
following
day
and
the
very
first
thing
he
told
me
was
that
to
his
certain
knowledge
there
was
an
immense
treasure
hidden
somewhere
in
the
papal
states
and
that
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
purchase
the
sheath
this
satisfied
me
that
there
was
no
fear
of
his
taking
me
at
my
word
so
i
produced
a
purse
full
of
gold
saying
i
was
quite
ready
to
complete
our
bargain
for
the
purchase
of
the
knife
the
treasure
he
said
is
worth
millions
but
let
us
have
dinner
you
are
not
going
to
be
served
in
silver
plates
and
dishes
but
in
real
raphael
mosaic
my
dear
commissary
your
magnificence
astonishes
me
mosaic
is
indeed
by
far
superior
to
silver
plate
although
an
ignorant
fool
would
only
consider
it
ugly
earthen
ware
the
compliment
delighted
him
after
dinner
he
spoke
as
follows
a
man
in
very
good
circumstances
residing
in
the
papal
states
and
owner
of
the
country
house
in
which
he
lives
with
all
his
family
is
certain
that
there
is
a
treasure
in
his
cellar
he
has
written
to
my
son
declaring
himself
ready
to
undertake
all
expenses
necessary
to
possess
himself
of
that
treasure
if
we
could
procure
a
magician
powerful
enough
to
unearth
it
the
son
then
took
a
letter
out
of
his
pocket
read
me
some
passages
and
begged
me
to
excuse
him
if
in
consequence
of
his
having
pledged
himself
to
keep
the
secret
he
could
not
communicate
all
the
contents
of
the
letter
but
i
had
unperceived
by
him
read
the
word
cesena
the
name
of
the
village
and
that
was
enough
for
me
therefore
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
give
me
the
possibility
of
purchasing
the
sheath
on
credit
for
i
have
no
ready
cash
at
present
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
endorsing
my
letters
of
exchange
and
if
you
should
know
the
magician
you
might
go
halves
with
him
the
magician
is
ready
it
is
i
but
unless
you
give
me
five
hundred
sequins
cash
down
we
can
not
agree
i
have
no
money
then
sell
me
the
knife
no
you
are
wrong
for
now
that
i
have
seen
it
i
can
easily
take
it
from
you
but
i
am
honest
enough
not
to
wish
to
play
such
a
trick
upon
you
you
could
take
my
knife
from
me
i
should
like
to
be
convinced
of
that
but
i
do
not
believe
it
you
do
not
very
well
the
knife
will
be
in
my
possession
but
when
it
is
once
in
my
hands
you
need
not
hope
to
see
it
again
a
spirit
which
is
under
my
orders
will
bring
it
to
me
at
midnight
and
the
same
spirit
will
tell
me
where
the
treasure
is
buried
let
the
spirit
tell
you
that
and
i
shall
be
convinced
give
me
a
pen
ink
and
paper
i
asked
a
question
from
my
oracle
and
the
answer
i
had
was
that
the
treasure
was
to
be
found
not
far
from
the
rubicon
that
is
i
said
a
torrent
which
was
once
a
river
they
consulted
a
dictionary
and
found
that
the
rubicon
flowed
through
cesena
they
were
amazed
and
as
i
wished
them
to
have
full
scope
for
wrong
reasoning
i
left
them
i
had
taken
a
fancy
not
to
purloin
five
hundred
sequins
from
those
poor
fools
but
to
go
and
unearth
the
amount
at
their
expense
in
the
house
of
another
fool
and
to
laugh
at
them
all
into
the
bargain
i
longed
to
play
the
part
of
a
magician
with
that
idea
when
i
left
the
house
of
the
ridiculous
antiquarian
i
proceeded
to
the
public
library
where
with
the
assistance
of
a
dictionary
i
wrote
the
following
specimen
of
facetious
erudition
the
treasure
is
buried
in
the
earth
at
a
depth
of
seventeen
and
a
half
fathoms
and
has
been
there
for
six
centuries
its
value
amounts
to
two
millions
of
sequins
enclosed
in
a
casket
the
same
which
was
taken
by
godfrey
de
bouillon
from
mathilda
countess
of
tuscany
in
the
year
when
he
endeavoured
to
assist
henry
iv
against
that
princess
he
buried
the
box
himself
in
the
very
spot
where
it
now
is
before
he
went
to
lay
siege
to
jerusalem
gregory
vii
who
was
a
great
magician
having
been
informed
of
the
place
where
it
had
been
hidden
had
resolved
on
getting
possession
of
it
himself
but
death
prevented
him
from
carrying
out
his
intentions
after
the
death
of
the
countess
mathilda
in
the
year
the
genius
presiding
over
all
hidden
treasures
appointed
seven
spirits
to
guard
the
box
during
a
night
with
a
full
moon
a
learned
magician
can
raise
the
treasure
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
by
placing
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
magical
ring
called
maximus
i
expected
to
see
the
father
and
son
and
they
came
early
in
the
morning
after
some
rambling
conversation
i
gave
them
what
i
had
composed
at
the
library
namely
the
history
of
the
treasure
taken
from
the
countess
mathilda
i
told
them
that
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
recover
the
treasure
and
i
promised
them
the
fourth
part
of
it
provided
they
would
purchase
the
sheath
i
concluded
by
threatening
again
to
possess
myself
of
their
knife
i
can
not
decide
said
the
commissary
before
i
have
seen
the
sheath
i
pledge
my
word
to
shew
it
to
you
i
answered
we
parted
company
highly
pleased
with
each
other
in
order
to
manufacture
a
sheath
such
as
the
wonderful
knife
required
it
was
necessary
to
combine
the
most
whimsical
idea
with
the
oddest
shape
i
recollected
very
well
the
form
of
the
blade
and
as
i
was
revolving
in
my
mind
the
best
way
to
produce
something
very
extravagant
but
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
i
had
in
view
i
spied
in
the
yard
of
the
hotel
an
old
piece
of
leather
the
remnant
of
what
had
been
a
fine
gentleman
boot
it
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
i
took
that
old
sole
boiled
it
and
made
in
it
a
slit
in
which
i
was
certain
that
the
knife
would
go
easily
then
i
pared
it
carefully
on
all
sides
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
its
former
use
being
found
out
i
rubbed
it
with
pumice
stone
sand
and
ochre
and
finally
i
succeeded
in
imparting
to
my
production
such
a
queer
shape
that
i
could
not
help
laughing
in
looking
at
my
work
when
i
presented
it
to
the
commissary
and
he
had
found
it
an
exact
fit
for
the
knife
the
good
man
remained
astounded
we
dined
together
and
after
dinner
it
was
decided
that
his
son
should
accompany
me
and
introduce
me
to
the
master
of
the
house
in
which
the
treasure
was
buried
that
i
was
to
receive
a
letter
of
exchange
for
one
thousand
roman
crowns
drawn
by
the
son
on
bologna
which
would
be
made
payable
to
my
name
only
after
i
should
have
found
the
treasure
and
that
the
knife
with
the
sheath
would
be
delivered
into
my
hands
only
when
i
should
require
it
for
the
great
operation
until
then
the
son
was
to
retain
possession
of
it
those
conditions
having
been
agreed
upon
we
made
an
agreement
in
writing
binding
upon
all
parties
and
our
departure
was
fixed
for
the
day
after
the
morrow
as
we
left
mantua
the
father
pronounced
a
fervent
blessing
over
his
son
head
and
told
me
that
he
was
count
palatine
shewing
me
the
diploma
which
he
had
received
from
the
pope
i
embraced
him
giving
him
his
title
of
count
and
pocketed
his
letter
of
exchange
after
bidding
adieu
to
marina
who
was
then
the
acknowledged
mistress
of
count
arcorati
and
to
baletti
whom
i
was
sure
of
meeting
again
in
venice
before
the
end
of
the
year
i
went
to
sup
with
my
friend
we
started
early
in
the
morning
travelled
through
ferrara
and
bologna
and
reached
cesena
where
we
put
up
at
the
we
got
up
early
the
next
day
and
walked
quietly
to
the
house
of
george
franzia
a
wealthy
peasant
who
was
owner
of
the
treasure
it
was
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
city
and
the
good
man
was
agreeably
surprised
by
our
arrival
he
embraced
capitani
whom
he
knew
already
and
leaving
me
with
his
family
he
went
out
with
my
companion
to
talk
business
observant
as
usual
i
passed
the
family
in
review
and
fixed
my
choice
upon
the
eldest
daughter
the
youngest
girl
was
ugly
and
the
son
looked
a
regular
fool
the
mother
seemed
to
be
the
real
master
of
the
household
and
there
were
three
or
four
servants
going
about
the
premises
the
eldest
daughter
was
called
genevieve
or
javotte
a
very
common
name
among
the
girls
of
cesena
i
told
her
that
i
thought
her
eighteen
but
she
answered
in
a
tone
half
serious
half
vexed
that
i
was
very
much
mistaken
for
she
had
only
just
completed
her
fourteenth
year
i
am
very
glad
it
is
so
my
pretty
child
these
words
brought
back
her
smile
the
house
was
well
situated
and
there
was
not
another
dwelling
around
it
for
at
least
four
hundred
yards
i
was
glad
to
see
that
i
should
have
comfortable
quarters
but
i
was
annoyed
by
a
very
unpleasant
stink
which
tainted
the
air
and
which
could
certainly
not
be
agreeable
to
the
spirits
i
had
to
evoke
madame
franzia
said
i
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
what
is
the
cause
of
that
bad
smell
sir
it
arises
from
the
hemp
which
we
are
macerating
i
concluded
that
if
the
cause
were
removed
i
should
get
rid
of
the
effect
what
is
that
hemp
worth
madam
i
enquired
about
forty
crowns
here
they
are
the
hemp
belongs
to
me
now
and
i
must
beg
your
husband
to
have
it
removed
immediately
capitani
called
me
and
i
joined
him
franzia
shewed
me
all
the
respect
due
to
a
great
magician
although
i
had
not
much
the
appearance
of
one
we
agreed
that
he
should
receive
of
the
treasure
capitani
another
fourth
and
that
the
remainder
should
belong
to
me
we
certainly
did
not
shew
much
respect
for
the
rights
of
saint
peter
i
told
franzia
that
i
should
require
a
room
with
two
beds
for
myself
alone
and
an
with
bathing
apparatus
capitani
room
was
to
be
in
a
different
part
of
the
house
and
my
room
was
to
be
provided
with
three
tables
two
of
them
small
and
one
large
i
added
that
he
must
at
once
procure
me
a
between
the
ages
of
fourteen
and
eighteen
she
was
to
be
a
virgin
and
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
as
well
as
every
person
in
the
house
keep
the
secret
faithfully
in
order
that
no
suspicion
of
our
proceedings
should
reach
the
inquisition
or
all
would
be
lost
i
intend
to
take
up
my
quarters
here
i
added
i
require
two
meals
every
day
and
the
only
wine
i
can
drink
is
jevese
for
my
breakfast
i
drink
a
peculiar
kind
of
chocolate
which
i
make
myself
and
which
i
have
brought
with
me
i
promise
to
pay
my
own
expenses
in
case
we
do
not
succeed
please
remove
the
hemp
to
a
place
sufficiently
distant
from
the
house
so
that
its
bad
smell
may
not
annoy
the
spirits
to
be
evoked
by
me
and
let
the
air
be
purified
by
the
discharge
of
gunpowder
besides
you
must
send
a
trusty
servant
to
convey
our
luggage
from
the
hotel
here
and
keep
constantly
in
the
house
and
at
my
disposal
one
hundred
new
wax
candles
and
three
torches
after
i
had
given
those
instructions
to
franzia
i
left
him
and
went
towards
cesena
with
capitani
but
we
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
we
heard
the
good
man
running
after
us
sir
he
said
to
me
be
kind
enough
to
take
back
the
forty
crowns
which
you
paid
to
my
wife
for
the
hemp
no
i
will
not
do
anything
of
the
sort
for
i
do
not
want
you
to
sustain
any
loss
take
them
back
i
beg
i
can
sell
the
hemp
in
the
course
of
the
day
for
forty
crowns
without
difficulty
in
that
case
i
will
for
i
have
confidence
in
what
you
say
such
proceedings
on
my
part
impressed
the
excellent
man
very
favourably
and
he
entertained
the
deepest
veneration
for
me
which
was
increased
when
against
capitani
advice
i
resolutely
refused
one
hundred
sequins
which
he
wanted
to
force
upon
me
for
my
travelling
expenses
i
threw
him
into
raptures
by
telling
him
that
on
the
eve
of
possessing
an
immense
treasure
it
was
unnecessary
to
think
of
such
trifles
the
next
morning
our
luggage
was
sent
for
and
we
found
ourselves
comfortably
located
in
the
house
of
the
wealthy
and
simple
franzia
he
gave
us
a
good
dinner
but
with
too
many
dishes
and
i
told
him
to
be
more
economical
and
to
give
only
some
good
fish
for
our
supper
which
he
did
after
supper
he
told
me
that
as
far
as
the
young
maiden
was
concerned
he
thought
he
could
recommend
his
daughter
javotte
as
he
had
consulted
his
wife
and
had
found
i
could
rely
upon
the
girl
being
a
virgin
very
good
i
said
now
tell
me
what
grounds
you
have
for
supposing
that
there
is
a
treasure
in
your
house
in
the
first
place
the
oral
tradition
transmitted
from
father
to
son
for
the
last
eight
generations
in
the
second
the
heavy
sounds
which
are
heard
under
ground
during
the
night
besides
the
door
of
the
cellar
opens
and
shuts
of
itself
every
three
or
four
minutes
which
must
certainly
be
the
work
of
the
devils
seen
every
night
wandering
through
the
country
in
the
shape
of
pyramidal
flames
if
it
is
as
you
say
it
is
evident
that
you
have
a
treasure
hidden
somewhere
in
your
house
it
is
as
certain
as
the
fact
that
two
and
two
are
four
be
very
careful
not
to
put
a
lock
to
the
door
of
the
cellar
to
prevent
its
opening
and
shutting
of
itself
otherwise
you
would
have
an
earthquake
which
would
destroy
everything
here
spirits
will
enjoy
perfect
freedom
and
they
break
through
every
obstacle
raised
against
them
god
be
praised
for
having
sent
here
forty
years
ago
a
learned
man
who
told
my
father
exactly
the
same
thing
that
great
magician
required
only
three
days
more
to
unearth
the
treasure
when
my
father
heard
that
the
inquisition
had
given
orders
to
arrest
him
and
he
lost
no
time
in
insuring
his
escape
can
you
tell
me
how
it
is
that
magicians
are
not
more
powerful
than
the
inquisitors
because
the
monks
have
a
greater
number
of
devils
under
their
command
than
we
have
but
i
feel
certain
that
your
father
had
already
expended
a
great
deal
of
money
with
that
learned
man
about
two
thousand
crowns
oh
more
more
i
told
franzia
to
follow
me
and
in
order
to
accomplish
something
in
the
magic
line
i
dipped
a
towel
in
some
water
and
uttering
fearful
words
which
belonged
to
no
human
language
i
washed
the
eyes
the
temples
and
the
chest
of
every
person
in
the
family
including
javotte
who
might
have
objected
to
it
if
i
had
not
begun
with
her
father
mother
and
brother
i
made
them
swear
upon
my
that
they
were
not
labouring
under
any
impure
disease
and
i
concluded
the
ceremony
by
compelling
javotte
to
swear
likewise
that
she
had
her
maidenhood
as
i
saw
that
she
was
blushing
to
the
very
roots
of
her
hair
in
taking
the
oath
i
was
cruel
enough
to
explain
to
her
what
it
meant
i
then
asked
her
to
swear
again
but
she
answered
that
there
was
no
need
of
it
now
that
she
knew
what
it
was
i
ordered
all
the
family
to
kiss
me
and
finding
that
javotte
had
eaten
garlic
i
forbade
the
use
of
it
entirely
which
order
franzia
promised
should
be
complied
with
genevieve
was
not
a
beauty
as
far
as
her
features
were
concerned
her
complexion
was
too
much
sunburnt
and
her
mouth
was
too
large
but
her
teeth
were
splendid
and
her
under
lip
projected
slightly
as
if
it
had
been
formed
to
receive
kisses
her
bosom
was
well
made
and
as
firm
as
a
rock
but
her
hair
was
too
light
and
her
hands
too
fleshy
the
defects
however
had
to
be
overlooked
and
altogether
she
was
not
an
unpleasant
morsel
i
did
not
purpose
to
make
her
fall
in
love
with
me
with
a
peasant
girl
that
task
might
have
been
a
long
one
all
i
wanted
was
to
train
her
to
perfect
obedience
which
in
default
of
love
has
always
appeared
to
me
the
essential
point
true
that
in
such
a
case
one
does
not
enjoy
the
ecstatic
raptures
of
love
but
one
finds
a
compensation
in
the
complete
control
obtained
over
the
woman
i
gave
notice
to
the
father
to
capitani
and
to
javotte
that
each
would
in
turn
and
in
the
order
of
their
age
take
supper
with
me
and
that
javotte
would
sleep
every
night
in
my
where
was
to
be
placed
a
bath
in
which
i
would
bathe
my
guest
one
half
hour
before
sitting
down
to
supper
and
the
guest
was
not
to
have
broken
his
fast
throughout
the
day
i
prepared
a
list
of
all
the
articles
of
which
i
pretended
to
be
in
need
and
giving
it
to
franzia
i
told
him
to
go
to
cesena
himself
the
next
day
and
to
purchase
everything
without
bargaining
to
obtain
a
lower
price
among
other
things
i
ordered
a
piece
from
twenty
to
thirty
yards
long
of
white
linen
thread
scissors
needles
storax
myrrh
sulphur
olive
oil
camphor
one
ream
of
paper
pens
and
ink
twelve
sheets
of
parchment
brushes
and
a
branch
of
olive
tree
to
make
a
stick
of
eighteen
inches
in
length
after
i
had
given
all
my
orders
very
seriously
and
without
any
wish
to
laugh
i
went
to
bed
highly
pleased
with
my
personification
of
a
magician
in
which
i
was
astonished
to
find
myself
so
completely
successful
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
sent
for
capitani
and
commanded
him
to
proceed
every
day
to
cesena
to
go
to
the
best
to
learn
carefully
every
piece
of
news
and
every
rumour
and
to
report
them
to
me
franzia
who
had
faithfully
obeyed
my
orders
returned
before
noon
from
the
city
with
all
the
articles
i
had
asked
for
i
have
not
bargained
for
anything
he
said
to
me
and
the
merchants
must
i
have
no
doubt
have
taken
me
for
a
fool
for
i
have
certainly
paid
more
than
the
things
are
worth
so
much
the
worse
for
them
if
they
have
deceived
you
but
you
would
have
spoilt
everything
if
you
had
beaten
them
down
in
their
price
now
send
me
your
daughter
and
let
me
be
alone
with
her
as
soon
as
javotte
was
in
my
room
i
made
her
cut
the
linen
in
seven
pieces
four
of
five
feet
long
two
of
two
feet
and
one
of
two
feet
and
a
half
the
last
one
was
intended
to
form
the
hood
of
the
robe
i
was
to
wear
for
the
great
operation
then
i
said
to
javotte
sit
down
near
my
bed
and
begin
sewing
you
will
dine
here
and
remain
at
work
until
the
evening
when
your
father
comes
you
must
let
us
be
alone
but
as
soon
as
he
leaves
me
come
back
and
go
to
bed
she
dined
in
my
room
where
her
mother
waited
on
her
without
speaking
and
gave
her
nothing
to
drink
except
jevese
wine
towards
evening
her
father
came
and
she
left
us
i
had
the
patience
to
wash
the
good
man
while
he
was
in
the
bath
after
which
he
had
supper
with
me
he
ate
voraciously
telling
me
that
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
remained
hours
without
breaking
his
fast
intoxicated
with
the
jevese
wine
he
had
drunk
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
until
morning
when
his
wife
brought
me
my
chocolate
javotte
was
kept
sewing
as
on
the
day
before
she
left
the
room
in
the
evening
when
capitani
came
in
and
i
treated
him
in
the
same
manner
as
franzia
on
the
third
day
it
was
javotte
turn
and
that
had
been
the
object
i
had
kept
in
view
all
the
time
when
the
hour
came
i
said
to
her
go
javotte
get
into
the
bath
and
call
me
when
you
are
ready
for
i
must
purify
you
as
i
have
purified
your
father
and
capitani
she
obeyed
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
called
me
i
performed
a
great
many
ablutions
on
every
part
of
her
body
making
her
assume
all
sorts
of
positions
for
she
was
perfectly
docile
but
as
i
was
afraid
of
betraying
myself
i
felt
more
suffering
than
enjoyment
and
my
indiscreet
hands
running
over
every
part
of
her
person
and
remaining
longer
and
more
willingly
on
a
certain
spot
the
sensitiveness
of
which
is
extreme
the
poor
girl
was
excited
by
an
ardent
fire
which
was
at
last
quenched
by
the
natural
result
of
that
excitement
i
made
her
get
out
of
the
bath
soon
after
that
and
as
i
was
drying
her
i
was
very
near
forgetting
magic
to
follow
the
impulse
of
nature
but
quicker
than
i
nature
relieved
itself
and
i
was
thus
enabled
to
reach
the
end
of
the
scene
without
anticipating
the
denouement
i
told
javotte
to
dress
herself
and
to
come
back
to
me
as
soon
as
she
was
ready
she
had
been
fasting
all
day
and
her
toilet
did
not
take
a
long
time
she
ate
with
a
ferocious
appetite
and
the
jevese
wine
which
she
drank
like
water
imparted
so
much
animation
to
her
complexion
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
see
how
sunburnt
she
was
being
alone
with
her
after
supper
i
said
to
her
my
dear
javotte
have
you
been
displeased
at
all
i
have
compelled
you
to
submit
to
this
evening
not
at
all
i
liked
it
very
much
then
i
hope
that
you
will
have
no
objection
to
get
in
the
bath
with
me
and
to
wash
me
as
i
have
washed
you
most
willingly
but
shall
i
know
how
to
do
it
well
i
will
teach
you
and
for
the
future
i
wish
you
to
sleep
every
night
in
my
room
because
i
must
have
a
complete
certainty
that
on
the
night
of
the
great
operation
i
shall
find
you
such
as
you
ought
to
be
from
that
time
javotte
was
at
her
ease
with
me
all
her
restraint
disappeared
she
would
look
at
me
and
smile
with
entire
confidence
nature
had
operated
and
the
mind
of
a
young
girl
soon
enlarges
its
sphere
when
pleasure
is
her
teacher
she
went
to
bed
and
as
she
knew
that
she
had
no
longer
anything
to
conceal
from
me
her
modesty
was
not
alarmed
when
she
undressed
herself
in
my
presence
it
was
very
warm
any
kind
of
covering
is
unpleasant
in
the
hot
weather
so
she
stripped
to
the
skin
and
soon
fell
asleep
i
did
the
same
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
some
regret
at
having
engaged
myself
not
to
take
advantage
of
the
position
before
the
night
of
the
great
incantation
i
knew
that
the
operation
to
unearth
the
treasure
would
be
a
complete
failure
but
i
knew
likewise
that
it
would
not
fail
because
javotte
virginity
was
gone
at
the
girl
rose
and
began
sewing
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
the
robe
i
told
her
to
make
a
crown
of
parchment
with
seven
long
points
on
which
i
painted
some
fearful
figures
and
hieroglyphs
in
the
evening
one
hour
before
supper
i
got
into
the
bath
and
javotte
joined
me
as
soon
as
i
called
her
she
performed
upon
me
with
great
zeal
the
same
ceremonies
that
i
had
done
for
her
the
day
before
and
she
was
as
gentle
and
docile
as
possible
i
spent
a
delicious
hour
in
that
bath
enjoying
everything
but
respecting
the
essential
point
my
kisses
making
her
happy
and
seeing
that
i
had
no
objection
to
her
caresses
she
loaded
me
with
them
i
was
so
pleased
at
all
the
amorous
enjoyment
her
senses
were
evidently
experiencing
that
i
made
her
easy
by
telling
her
that
the
success
of
the
great
magic
operation
depended
upon
the
amount
of
pleasure
she
enjoyed
she
then
made
extraordinary
efforts
to
persuade
me
that
she
was
happy
and
without
overstepping
the
limits
where
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
stop
we
got
out
of
the
bath
highly
pleased
with
each
other
as
we
were
on
the
point
of
going
to
bed
she
said
to
me
would
it
injure
the
success
of
your
operation
if
we
were
to
sleep
together
no
my
dear
girl
provided
you
are
a
virgin
on
the
day
of
the
great
incantation
it
is
all
i
require
she
threw
herself
in
my
arms
and
we
spent
a
delightful
night
during
which
i
had
full
opportunity
of
admiring
the
strength
of
her
constitution
as
well
as
my
own
restraint
for
i
had
sufficient
control
over
myself
not
to
break
through
the
last
obstacle
i
passed
a
great
part
of
the
following
night
with
franzia
and
capitani
in
order
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
the
wonderful
things
which
the
worthy
peasant
had
mentioned
to
me
standing
in
the
yard
i
heard
distinctly
heavy
blows
struck
under
the
ground
at
intervals
of
three
or
four
minutes
it
was
like
the
noise
which
would
be
made
by
a
heavy
pestle
falling
in
a
large
copper
mortar
i
took
my
pistols
and
placed
myself
near
the
door
of
the
cellar
holding
a
dark
lantern
in
my
hand
i
saw
the
door
open
slowly
and
in
about
thirty
seconds
closing
with
violence
i
opened
and
closed
it
myself
several
times
and
unable
to
discover
any
hidden
physical
cause
for
the
phenomenon
i
felt
satisfied
that
there
was
some
unknown
roguery
at
work
but
i
did
not
care
much
to
find
it
out
we
went
upstairs
again
and
placing
myself
on
the
balcony
i
saw
in
the
yard
several
shadows
moving
about
they
were
evidently
caused
by
the
heavy
and
damp
atmosphere
and
as
to
the
pyramidal
flames
which
i
could
see
hovering
over
the
fields
it
was
a
phenomenon
well
known
to
me
but
i
allowed
my
two
companions
to
remain
persuaded
that
they
were
the
spirits
keeping
watch
over
the
treasure
that
phenomenon
is
very
common
throughout
southern
italy
where
the
country
is
often
at
night
illuminated
by
those
meteors
which
the
people
believe
to
be
devils
and
ignorance
has
called
night
spirits
or
dear
reader
the
next
chapter
will
tell
you
how
my
magic
undertaking
ended
and
perhaps
you
will
enjoy
a
good
laugh
at
my
expense
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
hurting
my
feelings
chapter
xxii
the
incantation
a
terrible
storm
my
fright
javotte
virginity
is
saved
i
give
up
the
undertaking
and
sell
the
sheath
to
capitani
i
meet
juliette
and
count
alfani
alias
count
celi
i
make
up
my
mind
to
go
to
naples
why
i
take
a
different
road
my
great
operation
had
to
be
performed
on
the
following
day
otherwise
according
to
all
established
rules
i
would
have
had
to
wait
until
the
next
full
moon
i
had
to
make
the
gnomes
raise
the
treasure
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
at
the
very
spot
on
which
my
incantations
would
be
performed
of
course
i
knew
well
enough
that
i
should
not
succeed
but
i
knew
likewise
that
i
could
easily
reconcile
franzia
and
capitani
to
a
failure
by
inventing
some
excellent
reasons
for
our
want
of
success
in
the
mean
time
i
had
to
play
my
part
of
a
magician
in
which
i
took
a
real
delight
i
kept
javotte
at
work
all
day
sewing
together
in
the
shape
of
a
ring
some
thirty
sheets
of
paper
on
which
i
painted
the
most
wonderful
designs
that
ring
which
i
called
maximus
had
a
diameter
of
three
geometric
paces
i
had
manufactured
a
sort
of
sceptre
or
magic
wand
with
the
branch
of
olive
brought
by
franzia
from
cesena
thus
prepared
i
told
javotte
that
at
twelve
at
night
when
i
came
out
of
the
magic
ring
she
was
to
be
ready
for
everything
the
order
did
not
seem
repugnant
to
her
she
longed
to
give
me
that
proof
of
her
obedience
and
on
my
side
considering
myself
as
her
debtor
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
pay
my
debt
and
to
give
her
every
satisfaction
the
hour
having
struck
i
ordered
franzia
and
capitani
to
stand
on
the
balcony
so
as
to
be
ready
to
come
to
me
if
i
called
for
them
and
also
to
prevent
anyone
in
the
house
seeing
my
proceedings
i
then
threw
off
all
profane
garments
i
clothe
myself
in
the
long
white
robe
the
work
of
a
virgin
innocent
hands
i
allow
my
long
hair
to
fall
loosely
i
place
the
extraordinary
crown
on
my
head
the
circle
maximus
on
my
shoulders
and
seizing
the
sceptre
with
one
hand
the
wonderful
knife
with
the
other
i
go
down
into
the
yard
there
i
spread
my
circle
on
the
ground
uttering
the
most
barbarous
words
and
after
going
round
it
three
times
i
jump
into
the
middle
squatting
down
there
i
remain
a
few
minutes
motionless
then
i
rise
and
i
fix
my
eyes
upon
a
heavy
dark
cloud
coming
from
the
west
whilst
from
the
same
quarter
the
thunder
is
rumbling
loudly
what
a
sublime
genius
i
should
have
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
my
two
fools
if
having
a
short
time
before
taken
notice
of
the
sky
in
that
part
of
the
horizon
i
had
announced
to
them
that
my
operation
would
be
attended
by
that
phenomenon
the
cloud
spreads
with
fearful
rapidity
and
soon
the
sky
seems
covered
with
a
funeral
pall
on
which
the
most
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
keep
blazing
every
moment
such
a
storm
was
a
very
natural
occurrence
and
i
had
no
reason
to
be
astonished
at
it
but
somehow
fear
was
beginning
to
creep
into
me
and
i
wished
myself
in
my
room
my
fright
soon
increased
at
the
sight
of
the
lightning
and
on
hearing
the
claps
of
thunder
which
succeeded
each
other
with
fearful
rapidity
and
seemed
to
roar
over
my
very
head
i
then
realized
what
extraordinary
effect
fear
can
have
on
the
mind
for
i
fancied
that
if
i
was
not
annihilated
by
the
fires
of
heaven
which
were
flashing
all
around
me
it
was
only
because
they
could
not
enter
my
magic
ring
thus
was
i
admiring
my
own
deceitful
work
that
foolish
reason
prevented
me
from
leaving
the
circle
in
spite
of
the
fear
which
caused
me
to
shudder
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
belief
the
result
of
a
cowardly
fright
i
would
not
have
remained
one
minute
where
i
was
and
my
hurried
flight
would
no
doubt
have
opened
the
eyes
of
my
two
dupes
who
could
not
have
failed
to
see
that
far
from
being
a
magician
i
was
only
a
poltroon
the
violence
of
the
wind
the
claps
of
thunder
the
piercing
cold
and
above
all
fear
made
me
tremble
all
over
like
an
aspen
leaf
my
system
which
i
thought
proof
against
every
accident
had
vanished
i
acknowledged
an
avenging
god
who
had
waited
for
this
opportunity
of
punishing
me
at
one
blow
for
all
my
sins
and
of
annihilating
me
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
my
want
of
faith
the
complete
immobility
which
paralyzed
all
my
limbs
seemed
to
me
a
proof
of
the
uselessness
of
my
repentance
and
that
conviction
only
increased
my
consternation
but
the
roaring
of
the
thunder
dies
away
the
rain
begins
to
fall
heavily
danger
vanishes
and
i
feel
my
courage
reviving
such
is
man
or
at
all
events
such
was
i
at
that
moment
it
was
raining
so
fast
that
if
it
had
continued
pouring
with
the
same
violence
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
country
would
have
been
inundated
as
soon
as
the
rain
had
ceased
the
wind
abated
the
clouds
were
dispersed
and
the
moon
shone
in
all
its
splendour
like
silver
in
the
pure
blue
sky
i
take
up
my
magic
ring
and
telling
the
two
friends
to
retire
to
their
beds
without
speaking
to
me
i
hurry
to
my
room
i
still
felt
rather
shaken
and
casting
my
eyes
on
javotte
i
thought
her
so
pretty
that
i
felt
positively
frightened
i
allowed
her
to
dry
me
and
after
that
necessary
operation
i
told
her
piteously
to
go
to
bed
the
next
morning
she
told
me
that
when
she
saw
me
come
in
shaking
all
over
in
spite
of
the
heat
she
had
herself
shuddered
with
fear
after
eight
hours
of
sound
sleep
i
felt
all
right
but
i
had
had
enough
of
the
comedy
and
to
my
great
surprise
the
sight
of
genevieve
did
not
move
me
in
any
way
the
obedient
javotte
had
certainly
not
changed
but
i
was
not
the
same
i
was
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
reduced
to
a
state
of
apathy
and
in
consequence
of
the
superstitious
ideas
which
had
crowded
in
my
mind
the
previous
night
i
imagined
that
the
innocence
of
that
young
girl
was
under
the
special
protection
of
heaven
and
that
if
i
had
dared
to
rob
her
of
her
virginity
the
most
rapid
and
terrible
death
would
have
been
my
punishment
at
all
events
thanks
to
my
youth
and
my
exalted
ideas
i
fancied
that
through
my
resolutions
the
father
would
not
be
so
great
a
dupe
and
the
daughter
not
so
unhappy
unless
the
result
should
prove
as
unfortunate
for
her
as
it
had
been
for
poor
lucy
of
pasean
the
moment
that
javotte
became
in
my
eyes
an
object
of
holy
horror
my
departure
was
decided
the
resolution
was
all
the
more
irrevocable
because
i
fancied
some
old
peasant
might
have
witnessed
all
my
tricks
in
the
middle
of
the
magic
ring
in
which
case
the
most
holy
or
if
you
like
the
most
infernal
inquisition
receiving
information
from
him
might
very
well
have
caught
me
and
enhanced
my
fame
by
some
splendid
in
which
i
had
not
the
slightest
wish
to
be
the
principal
actor
it
struck
me
as
so
entirely
within
the
limits
of
probability
that
i
sent
at
once
for
franzia
and
capitani
and
in
the
presence
of
the
unpolluted
virgin
i
told
them
that
i
had
obtained
from
the
seven
spirits
watching
over
the
treasure
all
the
necessary
particulars
but
that
i
had
been
compelled
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
them
to
delay
the
extraction
of
the
treasure
placed
under
their
guardianship
i
told
franzia
that
i
would
hand
to
him
in
writing
all
the
information
which
i
had
compelled
the
spirits
to
give
me
i
produced
in
reality
a
few
minutes
afterwards
a
document
similar
to
the
one
i
had
concocted
at
the
public
library
in
mantua
adding
that
the
treasure
consisted
of
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
and
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
of
gold
dust
i
made
him
take
an
oath
on
my
to
wait
for
me
and
not
to
have
faith
in
any
magician
unless
he
gave
him
an
account
of
the
treasure
in
every
way
similar
to
the
one
which
as
a
great
favor
i
was
leaving
in
his
hands
i
ordered
him
to
burn
the
crown
and
the
ring
but
to
keep
the
other
things
carefully
until
my
return
as
for
you
capitani
i
said
to
my
companion
proceed
at
once
to
cesena
and
remain
at
the
inn
until
our
luggage
has
been
brought
by
the
man
whom
franzia
is
going
to
send
with
it
seeing
that
poor
javotte
looked
miserable
i
went
up
to
her
and
speaking
to
her
very
tenderly
i
promised
to
see
her
again
before
long
i
told
her
at
the
same
time
that
the
great
operation
having
been
performed
successfully
her
virginity
was
no
longer
necessary
and
that
she
was
at
liberty
to
marry
as
soon
as
she
pleased
or
whenever
a
good
opportunity
offered
itself
i
at
once
returned
to
the
city
where
i
found
capitani
making
his
preparations
to
go
to
the
fair
of
lugo
and
then
to
mantua
he
told
me
crying
like
a
child
that
his
father
would
be
in
despair
when
he
saw
him
come
back
without
the
knife
of
saint
peter
you
may
have
it
i
said
with
the
sheath
if
you
will
let
me
have
the
one
thousand
roman
crowns
the
amount
of
the
letter
of
exchange
he
thought
it
an
excellent
bargain
and
accepted
it
joyfully
i
gave
him
back
the
letter
of
exchange
and
made
him
sign
a
paper
by
which
he
undertook
to
return
the
sheath
whenever
i
brought
the
same
amount
but
he
is
still
waiting
for
it
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
wonderful
sheath
and
i
was
not
in
want
of
money
but
i
should
have
considered
myself
dishonoured
if
i
had
given
it
to
him
for
nothing
besides
i
thought
it
a
good
joke
to
levy
a
contribution
upon
the
ignorant
credulity
of
a
count
palatine
created
by
the
grace
of
the
pope
in
after
days
however
i
would
willingly
have
refunded
his
money
but
as
fate
would
have
it
we
did
not
see
each
other
for
a
long
time
and
when
i
met
him
again
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
return
the
amount
it
is
therefore
only
to
chance
that
i
was
indebted
for
the
sum
and
certainly
capitani
never
dreamed
of
complaining
for
being
the
possessor
of
cum
vagina
he
truly
believed
himself
the
master
of
every
treasure
concealed
in
the
papal
states
capitani
took
leave
of
me
on
the
following
day
and
i
intended
to
proceed
at
once
to
naples
but
i
was
again
prevented
this
is
how
it
happened
as
i
returned
to
the
inn
after
a
short
walk
mine
host
handed
me
the
bill
of
the
play
announcing
four
performances
of
the
didone
of
metastasio
at
the
spada
seeing
no
acquaintance
of
mine
among
the
actors
or
actresses
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
the
play
in
the
evening
and
to
start
early
the
next
day
with
a
remnant
of
my
fear
of
the
inquisition
urged
me
on
and
i
could
not
help
fancying
that
spies
were
at
my
heels
before
entering
the
house
i
went
into
the
actresses
and
the
leading
lady
struck
me
as
rather
her
name
was
narici
and
she
was
from
bologna
i
bowed
to
her
and
after
the
conversation
usual
in
such
cases
i
asked
her
whether
she
was
free
i
am
only
engaged
with
the
manager
she
answered
have
you
any
lover
no
i
offer
myself
for
the
post
if
you
have
no
objection
she
smiled
jeeringly
and
said
will
you
take
four
tickets
for
the
four
performances
i
took
two
sequins
out
of
my
purse
taking
care
to
let
her
see
that
it
was
well
filled
and
when
she
gave
me
the
four
tickets
presented
them
to
the
maid
who
was
dressing
her
and
was
prettier
than
the
mistress
and
so
left
the
room
without
uttering
a
single
word
she
called
me
back
i
pretended
not
to
hear
her
and
took
a
ticket
for
the
pit
after
the
first
ballet
finding
the
whole
performance
very
poor
i
was
thinking
of
going
away
when
happening
to
look
towards
the
chief
box
i
saw
to
my
astonishment
that
it
was
tenanted
by
the
venetian
manzoni
and
the
celebrated
juliette
the
reader
will
doubtless
remember
the
ball
she
gave
at
my
house
in
venice
and
the
smack
with
which
she
saluted
my
cheek
on
that
occasion
they
had
not
yet
noticed
me
and
i
enquired
from
the
person
seated
next
to
me
who
was
that
beautiful
lady
wearing
so
many
diamonds
he
told
me
that
she
was
madame
querini
from
venice
whom
count
spada
the
owner
of
the
theatre
who
was
sitting
near
her
had
brought
with
him
from
faenza
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
querini
had
married
her
at
last
but
i
did
not
think
of
renewing
the
acquaintance
for
reasons
which
my
reader
can
not
have
forgotten
if
he
recollects
our
quarrel
when
i
had
to
dress
her
as
an
abbe
i
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
when
she
happened
to
see
me
and
called
me
i
went
up
to
her
and
not
wishing
to
be
known
by
anyone
i
whispered
to
her
that
my
name
was
farusi
manzoni
informed
me
that
i
was
speaking
to
her
excellency
madame
querini
i
know
it
i
said
through
a
letter
which
i
have
received
from
venice
and
i
beg
to
offer
my
most
sincere
congratulations
to
madame
she
heard
me
and
introduced
me
to
count
spada
creating
me
a
baron
on
the
spot
he
invited
me
most
kindly
to
come
to
his
box
asked
me
where
i
came
from
where
i
was
going
to
and
begged
the
pleasure
of
my
company
at
supper
for
the
same
evening
ten
years
before
he
had
been
juliette
friend
in
vienna
when
maria
theresa
having
been
informed
of
the
pernicious
influence
of
her
beauty
gave
her
notice
to
quit
the
city
she
had
renewed
her
acquaintance
with
him
in
venice
and
had
contrived
to
make
him
take
her
to
bologna
on
a
pleasure
trip
manzoni
her
old
follower
who
gave
me
all
this
information
accompanied
her
in
order
to
bear
witness
of
her
good
conduct
before
querini
i
must
say
that
manzoni
was
not
a
chaperon
in
venice
she
wanted
everybody
to
believe
that
querini
had
married
her
secretly
but
at
a
distance
of
fifty
leagues
she
did
not
think
such
a
formality
necessary
and
she
had
already
been
presented
by
the
general
to
all
the
nobility
of
cesena
as
madame
querini
papozzes
querini
would
have
been
wrong
in
being
jealous
of
the
count
for
he
was
an
old
acquaintance
who
would
do
no
harm
besides
it
is
admitted
amongst
certain
women
that
the
reigning
lover
who
is
jealous
of
an
old
acquaintance
is
nothing
but
a
fool
and
ought
to
be
treated
as
such
juliette
most
likely
afraid
of
my
being
indiscreet
had
lost
no
time
in
making
the
first
advances
but
seeing
that
i
had
likewise
some
reason
to
fear
her
want
of
discretion
she
felt
reassured
from
the
first
moment
i
treated
her
politely
and
with
every
consideration
due
to
her
position
i
found
numerous
company
at
the
general
and
some
pretty
women
not
seeing
juliette
i
enquired
for
her
from
manzoni
who
told
me
that
she
was
at
the
faro
table
losing
her
money
i
saw
her
seated
next
to
the
banker
who
turned
pale
at
the
sight
of
my
face
he
was
no
other
than
the
count
celi
he
offered
me
a
card
which
i
refused
politely
but
i
accepted
juliette
offer
to
be
her
partner
she
had
about
fifty
sequins
i
handed
her
the
same
sum
and
took
a
seat
near
her
after
the
first
round
she
asked
me
if
i
knew
the
banker
celi
had
heard
the
question
i
answered
negatively
a
lady
on
my
left
told
me
that
the
banker
was
count
alfani
half
an
hour
later
madame
querini
went
seven
and
lost
she
increased
her
stake
of
ten
sequins
it
was
the
last
deal
of
the
game
and
therefore
the
decisive
one
i
rose
from
my
chair
and
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
banker
hands
but
in
spite
of
that
he
cheated
before
me
and
madame
lost
just
at
that
moment
the
general
offered
her
his
arm
to
go
to
supper
she
left
the
remainder
of
her
gold
on
the
table
and
after
supper
having
played
again
she
lost
every
sequin
i
enlivened
the
supper
by
my
stories
and
witty
jests
i
captivated
everybody
friendship
and
particularly
the
general
who
having
heard
me
say
that
i
was
going
to
naples
only
to
gratify
an
amorous
fancy
entreated
me
to
spend
a
month
with
him
and
to
sacrifice
my
whim
but
it
was
all
in
vain
my
heart
was
unoccupied
i
longed
to
see
lucrezia
and
therese
whose
charms
after
five
years
i
could
scarcely
recollect
i
only
consented
to
remain
in
cesena
the
four
days
during
which
the
general
intended
to
stay
the
next
morning
as
i
was
dressing
i
had
a
call
from
the
cowardly
i
received
him
with
a
jeering
smile
saying
that
i
had
expected
him
the
being
in
the
room
celi
did
not
answer
but
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
he
said
how
could
you
possibly
expect
my
visit
i
will
tell
you
my
reason
as
soon
as
you
have
handed
me
one
hundred
sequins
and
you
are
going
to
do
so
at
once
here
are
fifty
which
i
brought
for
you
you
can
not
demand
more
from
me
thank
you
i
take
them
on
account
but
as
i
am
i
advise
you
not
to
shew
yourself
this
evening
in
count
spada
for
you
would
not
be
admitted
and
it
would
be
owing
to
me
i
hope
that
you
will
think
twice
before
you
are
guilty
of
such
an
ungenerous
act
i
have
made
up
my
mind
but
now
leave
me
there
was
a
knock
at
my
door
and
the
count
alfani
went
away
without
giving
me
the
trouble
of
repeating
my
order
my
new
visitor
proved
to
be
the
first
castrato
of
the
theatre
who
brought
an
invitation
to
dinner
from
narici
the
invitation
was
curious
and
i
accepted
it
with
a
smile
the
castrato
was
named
nicolas
peritti
he
pretended
to
be
the
grandson
of
a
natural
child
of
sixtus
it
might
have
been
so
i
shall
have
to
mention
him
again
in
fifteen
years
when
i
made
my
appearance
at
narici
house
i
saw
count
alfani
who
certainly
did
not
expect
me
and
must
have
taken
me
for
his
evil
genius
he
bowed
to
me
with
great
politeness
and
begged
that
i
would
listen
to
a
few
words
in
private
here
are
fifty
sequins
more
he
said
but
as
an
honest
man
you
can
take
them
only
to
give
them
to
madame
querini
but
how
can
you
hand
the
amount
to
her
without
letting
her
know
that
you
have
forced
me
to
refund
it
you
understand
what
consequences
such
a
confession
might
have
for
me
i
shall
give
her
the
money
only
when
you
have
left
this
place
in
the
mean
time
i
promise
to
be
discreet
but
be
careful
not
to
assist
fortune
in
my
presence
or
i
must
act
in
a
manner
that
will
not
be
agreeable
to
you
double
the
capital
of
my
bank
and
we
can
be
partners
your
proposal
is
an
insult
he
gave
me
fifty
sequins
and
i
promised
to
keep
his
secret
there
was
a
numerous
attendance
in
narici
rooms
especially
of
young
men
who
after
dinner
lost
all
their
money
i
did
not
play
and
it
was
a
disappointment
for
my
pretty
hostess
who
had
invited
me
only
because
she
had
judged
me
as
simple
as
the
others
i
remained
an
indifferent
witness
of
the
play
and
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
realizing
how
wise
mahomet
had
been
in
forbidding
all
games
of
chance
in
the
evening
after
the
opera
count
celi
had
the
faro
bank
and
i
lose
two
hundred
sequins
but
i
could
only
accuse
ill
luck
madame
querini
won
the
next
day
before
supper
i
broke
the
bank
and
after
supper
feeling
tired
and
well
pleased
with
what
i
had
won
i
returned
to
the
inn
the
following
morning
which
was
the
third
day
and
therefore
the
last
but
one
of
my
stay
in
cesena
i
called
at
the
general
i
heard
that
his
adjutant
had
thrown
the
cards
in
alfani
face
and
that
a
meeting
had
been
arranged
between
them
for
twelve
i
went
to
the
room
and
offered
to
be
his
second
assuring
him
that
there
would
be
no
blood
spilt
he
declined
my
offer
with
many
thanks
and
at
he
told
me
that
i
had
guessed
rightly
for
count
alfani
had
left
for
rome
in
that
case
i
said
to
the
guests
i
will
take
the
bank
tonight
after
dinner
being
alone
with
madame
querini
i
told
her
all
about
alfani
alias
celi
and
handed
her
the
fifty
sequins
of
which
i
was
the
depositary
i
suppose
she
said
that
by
means
of
this
fable
you
hope
to
make
me
accept
fifty
sequins
but
i
thank
you
i
am
not
in
want
of
money
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
have
compelled
the
thief
to
refund
this
money
together
with
the
fifty
sequins
of
which
he
had
likewise
cheated
me
that
may
be
but
i
do
not
wish
to
believe
you
i
beg
to
inform
you
that
i
am
not
simple
enough
to
allow
myself
to
be
duped
and
what
is
worse
cheated
in
such
a
manner
philosophy
forbids
a
man
to
feel
repentance
for
a
good
deed
but
he
must
certainly
have
a
right
to
regret
such
a
deed
when
it
is
malevolently
misconstrued
and
turned
against
him
as
a
reproach
in
the
evening
after
the
performance
which
was
to
be
the
last
i
took
the
bank
according
to
my
promise
i
lost
a
few
sequins
but
was
caressed
by
everybody
and
that
is
much
more
pleasant
than
winning
when
we
are
not
labouring
under
the
hard
necessity
of
making
money
count
spada
who
had
got
quite
fond
of
me
wanted
me
to
accompany
him
to
brisighetta
but
i
resisted
his
entreaties
because
i
had
firmly
resolved
on
going
to
naples
the
next
morning
i
was
awoke
by
a
terrible
noise
in
the
passage
almost
at
the
door
of
my
room
getting
out
of
my
bed
i
open
my
door
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
uproar
i
see
a
troop
of
at
the
door
of
a
chamber
and
in
that
chamber
sitting
up
in
bed
a
man
who
was
making
himself
hoarse
by
screaming
in
latin
against
that
rabble
the
plague
of
italy
and
against
the
who
had
been
rascally
enough
to
open
the
door
i
enquire
of
the
what
it
all
means
this
gentleman
answers
the
scoundrel
who
it
appears
can
only
speak
latin
is
in
bed
with
a
girl
and
the
of
the
bishop
have
been
sent
to
know
whether
she
is
truly
his
wife
all
perfectly
regular
if
she
is
his
wife
he
has
only
to
convince
them
by
shewing
a
certificate
of
marriage
but
if
she
is
not
of
course
he
must
go
to
prison
with
her
yet
it
need
not
happen
for
i
undertake
to
arrange
everything
in
a
friendly
manner
for
a
few
sequins
i
have
only
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
the
chief
of
the
and
they
will
all
go
away
if
you
can
speak
latin
you
had
better
go
in
and
make
him
listen
to
reason
who
has
broken
open
the
door
of
his
room
nobody
i
have
opened
it
myself
with
the
key
as
is
my
duty
yes
the
duty
of
a
highway
robber
but
not
of
an
honest
such
infamous
dealing
aroused
my
indignation
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
interfere
i
enter
the
room
although
i
had
still
my
nightcap
on
and
inform
the
gentleman
of
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
he
answers
with
a
laugh
that
in
the
first
place
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
the
person
who
was
in
bed
with
him
was
a
woman
for
that
person
had
only
been
seen
in
the
costume
of
a
military
officer
and
that
in
the
second
place
he
did
not
think
that
any
human
being
had
a
right
to
compel
him
to
say
whether
his
was
his
wife
or
his
mistress
even
supposing
that
his
companion
was
truly
a
woman
at
all
events
he
added
i
am
determined
not
to
give
one
crown
to
arrange
the
affair
and
to
remain
in
bed
until
my
door
is
shut
the
moment
i
am
dressed
i
will
treat
you
to
an
amusing
denouement
of
the
comedy
i
will
drive
away
all
those
scoundrels
at
the
point
of
my
sword
i
then
see
in
a
corner
a
broad
sword
and
a
hungarian
costume
looking
like
a
military
uniform
i
ask
whether
he
is
an
officer
i
have
written
my
name
and
profession
he
answers
in
the
hotel
book
astonished
at
the
absurdity
of
the
i
ask
him
whether
it
is
so
he
confesses
it
but
adds
that
the
clergy
have
the
right
to
prevent
scandal
the
insult
you
have
offered
to
that
officer
landlord
will
cost
you
very
dear
his
only
answer
is
to
laugh
in
my
face
highly
enraged
at
seeing
such
a
scoundrel
laugh
at
me
i
take
up
the
officer
quarrel
warmly
and
asked
him
to
entrust
his
passport
to
me
for
a
few
minutes
i
have
two
he
says
therefore
i
can
let
you
have
one
and
taking
the
document
out
of
his
he
hands
it
to
me
the
passport
was
signed
by
cardinal
albani
the
officer
was
a
captain
in
a
hungarian
regiment
belonging
to
the
empress
and
queen
he
was
from
rome
on
his
way
to
parma
with
dispatches
from
cardinal
albani
alexander
to
dutillot
prime
minister
of
the
infante
of
parma
at
the
same
moment
a
man
burst
into
the
room
speaking
very
loudly
and
asked
me
to
tell
the
officer
that
the
affair
must
be
settled
at
once
because
he
wanted
to
leave
cesena
immediately
who
are
you
i
asked
the
man
he
answered
that
he
was
the
whom
the
captain
had
engaged
i
saw
that
it
was
a
regular
thing
and
begged
the
captain
to
let
me
attend
to
the
business
assuring
him
that
i
would
settle
it
to
his
honour
and
advantage
do
exactly
as
you
please
he
said
then
turning
towards
the
i
ordered
him
to
bring
up
the
captain
luggage
saying
that
he
would
be
paid
at
once
when
he
had
done
so
i
handed
him
eight
sequins
out
of
my
own
purse
and
made
him
give
me
a
receipt
in
the
name
of
the
captain
who
could
only
speak
german
hungarian
and
latin
the
vetturino
went
away
and
the
followed
him
in
the
greatest
consternation
except
two
who
remained
captain
i
said
to
the
hungarian
keep
your
bed
until
i
return
i
am
going
now
to
the
bishop
to
give
him
an
account
of
these
proceedings
and
make
him
understand
that
he
owes
you
some
reparation
besides
general
spada
is
here
and
i
know
him
interrupted
the
captain
and
if
i
had
been
aware
of
his
being
in
cesena
i
would
have
shot
the
landlord
when
he
opened
my
door
to
those
scoundrels
i
hurried
over
my
toilet
and
without
waiting
for
my
hair
to
be
dressed
i
proceeded
to
the
bishop
palace
and
making
a
great
deal
of
noise
i
almost
compelled
the
servants
to
take
me
to
his
room
a
lackey
who
was
at
the
door
informed
me
that
his
lordship
was
still
in
bed
never
mind
i
can
not
wait
i
pushed
him
aside
and
entered
the
room
i
related
the
whole
affair
to
the
bishop
exaggerating
the
uproar
making
much
of
the
injustice
of
such
proceedings
and
railing
at
a
vexatious
police
daring
to
molest
travellers
and
to
insult
the
sacred
rights
of
individuals
and
nations
the
bishop
without
answering
me
referred
me
to
his
chancellor
to
whom
i
repeated
all
i
had
said
to
the
bishop
but
with
words
calculated
to
irritate
rather
than
to
soften
and
certainly
not
likely
to
obtain
the
release
of
the
captain
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
threaten
and
i
said
that
if
i
were
in
the
place
of
the
officer
i
would
demand
a
public
reparation
the
priest
laughed
at
my
threats
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
and
after
asking
me
whether
i
had
taken
leave
of
my
senses
the
chancellor
told
me
to
apply
to
the
captain
of
the
i
shall
go
to
somebody
else
i
said
reverend
sir
besides
the
captain
of
the
delighted
at
having
made
matters
worse
i
left
him
and
proceeded
straight
to
the
house
of
general
spada
but
being
told
that
he
could
not
be
seen
before
eight
i
returned
to
the
inn
the
state
of
excitement
in
which
i
was
the
ardour
with
which
i
had
made
the
affair
mine
might
have
led
anyone
to
suppose
that
my
indignation
had
been
roused
only
by
disgust
at
seeing
an
odious
persecution
perpetrated
upon
a
stranger
by
an
unrestrained
immoral
and
vexatious
police
but
why
should
i
deceive
the
kind
reader
to
whom
i
have
promised
to
tell
the
truth
i
must
therefore
say
that
my
indignation
was
real
but
my
ardour
was
excited
by
another
feeling
of
a
more
personal
nature
i
fancied
that
the
woman
concealed
under
the
was
a
beauty
i
longed
to
see
her
face
which
shame
most
likely
had
prevented
her
from
shewing
she
had
heard
me
speak
and
the
good
opinion
that
i
had
of
myself
did
not
leave
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
in
my
mind
that
she
would
prefer
me
to
her
captain
the
door
of
the
room
being
still
open
i
went
in
and
related
to
the
captain
all
i
had
done
assuring
him
that
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
would
be
at
liberty
to
continue
his
journey
at
the
bishop
expense
for
the
general
would
not
fail
to
obtain
complete
satisfaction
for
him
he
thanked
me
warmly
gave
back
the
eight
ducats
i
had
paid
for
him
and
said
that
he
would
not
leave
the
city
till
the
next
day
from
what
country
i
asked
him
is
your
travelling
companion
from
france
and
he
only
speaks
his
native
language
then
you
speak
french
not
one
word
that
is
amusing
then
you
converse
in
pantomime
exactly
i
pity
you
for
it
is
a
difficult
language
yes
to
express
the
various
shades
of
thought
but
in
the
material
part
of
our
intercourse
we
understand
each
other
quite
well
may
i
invite
myself
to
breakfast
with
you
ask
my
friend
whether
he
has
any
objection
amiable
companion
of
the
captain
i
said
in
french
will
you
kindly
accept
me
as
a
third
guest
at
the
at
these
words
i
saw
coming
out
of
the
a
lovely
head
with
dishevelled
hair
and
a
blooming
laughing
face
which
although
it
was
crowned
with
a
man
cap
left
no
doubt
that
the
captain
friend
belonged
to
that
sex
without
which
man
would
be
the
most
miserable
animal
on
earth
delighted
with
the
graceful
creature
i
told
her
that
i
had
been
happy
enough
to
feel
interested
in
her
even
before
i
had
seen
her
and
that
now
that
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
i
could
but
renew
with
greater
zeal
all
my
efforts
to
serve
her
she
answered
me
with
the
grace
and
the
animation
which
are
the
exclusive
privilege
of
her
native
country
and
retorted
my
argument
in
the
most
witty
manner
i
was
already
under
the
charm
my
request
was
granted
i
went
out
to
order
breakfast
and
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
making
themselves
comfortable
in
bed
for
they
were
determined
not
to
get
up
until
the
door
of
their
room
was
closed
again
the
waiter
came
and
i
went
in
with
him
i
found
my
lovely
frenchwoman
wearing
a
blue
with
her
hair
badly
arranged
like
a
man
but
very
charming
even
in
that
strange
costume
i
longed
to
see
her
up
she
ate
her
breakfast
without
once
interrupting
the
officer
speaking
to
me
but
to
whom
i
was
not
listening
or
listening
with
very
little
attention
for
i
was
in
a
sort
of
ecstatic
trance
immediately
after
breakfast
i
called
on
the
general
and
related
the
affair
to
him
enlarging
upon
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
pique
his
martial
pride
i
told
him
that
unless
he
settled
the
matter
himself
the
hungarian
captain
was
determined
to
send
an
express
to
the
cardinal
immediately
but
my
eloquence
was
unnecessary
for
the
general
liked
to
see
priests
attend
to
the
business
of
heaven
but
he
could
not
bear
them
to
meddle
in
temporal
affairs
i
shall
he
said
immediately
put
a
stop
to
this
ridiculous
comedy
and
treat
it
in
a
very
serious
manner
go
at
once
to
the
inn
he
said
to
his
invite
that
officer
and
his
companion
to
dine
with
me
and
repair
afterwards
to
the
bishop
palace
give
him
notice
that
the
officer
who
has
been
so
grossly
insulted
by
his
shall
not
leave
the
city
before
he
has
received
a
complete
apology
and
whatever
sum
of
money
he
may
claim
as
damages
tell
him
that
the
notice
comes
from
me
and
that
all
the
expenses
incurred
by
the
officer
shall
be
paid
by
him
what
pleasure
it
was
for
me
to
listen
to
these
words
in
my
vanity
i
fancied
i
had
almost
prompted
them
to
the
general
i
accompanied
the
and
introduced
him
to
the
captain
who
received
him
with
the
joy
of
a
soldier
meeting
a
comrade
the
adjutant
gave
him
the
invitation
for
him
and
his
companion
and
asked
him
to
write
down
what
satisfaction
he
wanted
as
well
as
the
amount
of
damages
he
claimed
at
the
sight
of
the
general
adjutant
the
had
quickly
vanished
i
handed
to
the
captain
pen
paper
and
ink
and
he
wrote
his
claim
in
pretty
good
latin
for
a
native
of
hungary
the
excellent
fellow
absolutely
refused
to
ask
for
more
than
thirty
sequins
in
spite
of
all
i
said
to
make
him
claim
one
hundred
he
was
likewise
a
great
deal
too
easy
as
to
the
satisfaction
he
demanded
for
all
he
asked
was
to
see
the
landlord
and
the
beg
his
pardon
on
their
knees
in
the
presence
of
the
general
adjutant
he
threatened
the
bishop
to
send
an
express
to
rome
to
cardinal
alexander
unless
his
demands
were
complied
with
within
two
hours
and
to
remain
in
cesena
at
the
rate
of
ten
sequins
a
day
at
the
bishop
expense
the
officer
left
us
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
landlord
came
in
respectfully
to
inform
the
captain
that
he
was
free
but
the
captain
having
begged
me
to
tell
the
scoundrel
that
he
owed
him
a
sound
thrashing
he
lost
no
time
in
gaining
the
door
i
left
my
friends
alone
to
get
dressed
and
to
attend
to
my
own
toilet
as
i
dined
with
them
at
the
general
an
hour
afterwards
i
found
them
ready
in
their
military
costumes
the
uniform
of
the
frenchwoman
was
of
course
a
fancy
one
but
very
elegant
the
moment
i
saw
her
i
gave
up
all
idea
of
naples
and
decided
upon
accompanying
the
two
friends
to
parma
the
beauty
of
the
lovely
frenchwoman
had
already
captivated
me
the
captain
was
certainly
on
the
threshold
of
sixty
and
as
a
matter
of
course
i
thought
such
a
union
very
badly
assorted
i
imagined
that
the
affair
which
i
was
already
concocting
in
my
brain
could
be
arranged
amicably
the
adjutant
came
back
with
a
priest
sent
by
the
bishop
who
told
the
captain
that
he
should
have
the
satisfaction
as
well
as
the
damages
he
had
claimed
but
that
he
must
be
content
with
fifteen
sequins
thirty
or
nothing
dryly
answered
the
hungarian
they
were
at
last
given
to
him
and
thus
the
matter
ended
the
victory
was
due
to
my
exertions
and
i
had
won
the
friendship
of
the
captain
and
his
lovely
companion
in
order
to
guess
even
at
first
sight
that
the
friend
of
the
worthy
captain
was
not
a
man
it
was
enough
to
look
at
the
hips
she
was
too
well
made
as
a
woman
ever
to
pass
for
a
man
and
the
women
who
disguise
themselves
in
male
attire
and
boast
of
being
like
men
are
very
wrong
for
by
such
a
boast
they
confess
themselves
deficient
in
one
of
the
greatest
perfections
appertaining
to
woman
a
little
before
we
repaired
to
general
spada
mansion
and
the
general
presented
the
two
officers
to
all
the
ladies
not
one
of
them
was
deceived
in
the
young
officer
but
being
already
acquainted
with
the
adventure
they
were
all
delighted
to
dine
with
the
hero
of
the
comedy
and
treated
the
handsome
officer
exactly
as
if
he
had
truly
been
a
man
but
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
the
male
guests
offered
the
frenchwoman
homages
more
worthy
of
her
sex
madame
querini
alone
did
not
seem
pleased
because
the
lovely
stranger
monopolized
the
general
attention
and
it
was
a
blow
to
her
vanity
to
see
herself
neglected
she
never
spoke
to
her
except
to
shew
off
her
french
which
she
could
speak
well
the
poor
captain
scarcely
opened
his
lips
for
no
one
cared
to
speak
latin
and
the
general
had
not
much
to
say
in
german
an
elderly
priest
who
was
one
of
the
guests
tried
to
justify
the
conduct
of
the
bishop
by
assuring
us
that
the
and
the
had
acted
only
under
the
orders
of
the
holy
office
that
is
the
reason
he
said
for
which
no
bolts
are
allowed
in
the
rooms
of
the
hotels
so
that
strangers
may
not
shut
themselves
up
in
their
chambers
the
holy
inquisition
does
not
allow
a
man
to
sleep
with
any
woman
but
his
wife
twenty
years
later
i
found
all
the
doors
in
spain
with
a
bolt
outside
so
that
travellers
were
as
if
they
had
been
in
prison
exposed
to
the
outrageous
molestation
of
nocturnal
visits
from
the
police
that
disease
is
so
chronic
in
spain
that
it
threatens
to
overthrow
the
monarchy
some
day
and
i
should
not
be
astonished
if
one
fine
morning
the
grand
inquisitor
was
to
have
the
king
shaved
and
to
take
his
place
chapter
xxiii
i
purchase
a
handsome
carriage
and
proceed
to
parma
with
the
old
captain
and
the
young
frenchwoman
i
pay
a
visit
to
javotte
and
present
her
with
a
beautiful
pair
of
gold
bracelets
my
perplexities
respecting
my
lovely
travelling
companion
a
monologue
conversation
with
the
captain
with
henriette
the
conversation
was
animated
and
the
young
female
officer
was
entertaining
everybody
even
madame
querini
although
she
hardly
took
the
trouble
of
concealing
her
spleen
it
seems
strange
she
remarked
that
you
and
the
captain
should
live
together
without
ever
speaking
to
each
other
why
madam
we
understand
one
another
perfectly
for
speech
is
of
very
little
consequence
in
the
kind
of
business
we
do
together
that
answer
given
with
graceful
liveliness
made
everybody
laugh
except
madame
who
foolishly
assuming
the
air
of
a
prude
thought
that
its
meaning
was
too
clearly
expressed
i
do
not
know
any
kind
of
business
she
said
that
can
be
transacted
without
the
assistance
of
the
voice
or
the
pen
excuse
me
madam
there
are
some
playing
at
cards
for
instance
is
a
business
of
that
sort
are
you
always
playing
we
do
nothing
else
we
play
the
game
of
the
pharaoh
faro
and
i
hold
the
bank
everybody
understanding
the
shrewdness
of
this
evasive
answer
laughed
again
and
juliette
herself
could
not
help
joining
in
the
general
merriment
but
tell
me
said
count
spada
does
the
bank
receive
much
as
for
the
deposits
they
are
of
so
little
importance
that
they
are
hardly
worth
mentioning
no
one
ventured
upon
translating
that
sentence
for
the
benefit
of
the
worthy
captain
the
conversation
continued
in
the
same
amusing
style
and
all
the
guests
were
delighted
with
the
graceful
wit
of
the
charming
officer
late
in
the
evening
i
took
leave
of
the
general
and
wished
him
a
pleasant
journey
adieu
he
said
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
to
naples
and
hope
you
will
enjoy
yourself
there
well
general
i
am
not
going
to
naples
immediately
i
have
changed
my
mind
and
intend
to
proceed
to
parma
where
i
wish
to
see
the
infante
i
also
wish
to
constitute
myself
the
interpreter
of
these
two
officers
who
know
nothing
of
italian
ah
young
man
opportunity
makes
a
thief
does
it
not
well
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
do
the
same
i
also
bade
farewell
to
madame
querini
who
asked
me
to
write
to
her
from
bologna
i
gave
her
a
promise
to
do
so
but
without
meaning
to
fulfil
it
i
had
felt
interested
in
the
young
frenchwoman
when
she
was
hiding
under
the
she
had
taken
my
fancy
the
moment
she
had
shewn
her
features
and
still
more
when
i
had
seen
her
dressed
she
completed
her
conquest
at
the
by
the
display
of
a
wit
which
i
greatly
admired
it
is
rare
in
italy
and
seems
to
belong
generally
to
the
daughters
of
france
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
win
her
love
and
i
resolved
on
trying
putting
my
on
one
side
i
fancied
i
would
suit
her
much
better
than
the
old
hungarian
a
very
pleasant
man
for
his
age
but
who
after
all
carried
his
sixty
years
on
his
face
while
my
were
blooming
on
my
countenance
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
captain
himself
would
not
raise
any
great
objection
for
he
seemed
one
of
those
men
who
treating
love
as
a
matter
of
pure
fancy
accept
all
circumstances
easily
and
give
way
to
all
the
freaks
of
fortune
by
becoming
the
travelling
companion
of
this
couple
i
should
probably
succeed
in
my
aims
i
never
dreamed
of
experiencing
a
refusal
at
their
hands
my
company
would
certainly
be
agreeable
to
them
as
they
could
not
exchange
a
single
word
by
themselves
with
this
idea
i
asked
the
captain
as
we
reached
our
inn
whether
he
intended
to
proceed
to
parma
by
the
public
coach
or
otherwise
as
i
have
no
carriage
of
my
own
he
answered
we
shall
have
to
take
the
coach
i
have
a
very
comfortable
carriage
and
i
offer
you
the
two
back
seats
if
you
have
no
objection
to
my
society
that
is
a
piece
of
good
fortune
be
kind
enough
to
propose
it
to
henriette
will
you
madam
grant
me
the
favour
of
accompanying
you
to
parma
i
should
be
delighted
for
we
could
have
some
conversation
but
take
care
sir
your
task
will
not
be
an
easy
one
you
will
often
find
yourself
obliged
to
translate
for
both
of
us
i
shall
do
so
with
great
pleasure
i
am
only
sorry
that
the
journey
is
not
longer
we
can
arrange
everything
at
allow
me
to
leave
you
now
as
i
have
some
business
to
settle
my
business
was
in
reference
to
a
carriage
for
the
one
i
had
boasted
of
existed
only
in
my
imagination
i
went
to
the
most
fashionable
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
heard
that
there
was
a
travelling
carriage
for
sale
which
no
one
would
buy
because
it
was
too
expensive
two
hundred
sequins
were
asked
for
it
although
it
had
but
two
seats
and
a
for
a
third
person
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
i
called
at
the
place
where
it
would
be
seen
i
found
a
very
fine
english
carriage
which
could
not
have
cost
less
than
two
hundred
guineas
its
noble
proprietor
was
then
at
supper
so
i
sent
him
my
name
requesting
him
not
to
dispose
of
his
carriage
until
the
next
morning
and
i
went
back
to
the
hotel
well
pleased
with
my
discovery
at
supper
i
arranged
with
the
captain
that
we
would
not
leave
cesena
till
after
dinner
on
the
following
day
and
the
conversation
was
almost
entirely
a
dialogue
between
henriette
and
myself
it
was
my
first
talk
with
a
french
woman
i
thought
this
young
creature
more
and
more
charming
yet
i
could
not
suppose
her
to
be
anything
else
but
an
adventurers
and
i
was
astonished
at
discovering
in
her
those
noble
and
delicate
feelings
which
denote
a
good
education
however
as
such
an
idea
would
not
have
suited
the
views
i
had
about
her
i
rejected
it
whenever
it
presented
itself
to
my
mind
whenever
i
tried
to
make
her
talk
about
the
captain
she
would
change
the
subject
of
conversation
or
evade
my
insinuations
with
a
tact
and
a
shrewdness
which
astonished
and
delighted
me
at
the
same
time
for
everything
she
said
bore
the
impress
of
grace
and
wit
yet
she
did
not
elude
this
question
at
least
tell
me
madam
whether
the
captain
is
your
husband
or
your
father
neither
one
nor
the
other
she
answered
with
a
smile
that
was
enough
for
me
and
in
reality
what
more
did
i
want
to
know
the
worthy
captain
had
fallen
asleep
when
he
awoke
i
wished
them
both
good
night
and
retired
to
my
room
with
a
heart
full
of
love
and
a
mind
full
of
projects
i
saw
that
everything
had
taken
a
good
turn
and
i
felt
certain
of
success
for
i
was
young
i
enjoyed
excellent
health
i
had
money
and
plenty
of
daring
i
liked
the
affair
all
the
better
because
it
must
come
to
a
conclusion
in
a
few
days
early
the
next
morning
i
called
upon
count
dandini
the
owner
of
the
carriage
and
as
i
passed
a
jeweller
shop
i
bought
a
pair
of
gold
bracelets
in
venetian
filigree
each
five
yards
long
and
of
rare
fineness
i
intended
them
as
a
present
for
javotte
the
moment
count
dandini
saw
me
he
recognized
me
he
had
seen
me
in
padua
at
the
house
of
his
father
who
was
professor
of
civil
law
at
the
time
i
was
a
student
there
i
bought
his
carriage
on
condition
that
he
would
send
it
to
me
in
good
repair
at
one
in
the
afternoon
having
completed
the
purchase
i
went
to
my
friend
franzia
and
my
present
of
the
bracelets
made
javotte
perfectly
happy
there
was
not
one
girl
in
cesena
who
could
boast
of
possessing
a
finer
pair
and
with
that
present
my
conscience
felt
at
ease
for
it
paid
the
expense
i
had
occasioned
during
my
stay
of
ten
or
twelve
days
at
her
father
house
four
times
over
but
this
was
not
the
most
important
present
i
offered
the
family
i
made
the
father
take
an
oath
to
wait
for
me
and
never
to
trust
in
any
pretended
magician
for
the
necessary
operation
to
obtain
the
treasure
even
if
i
did
not
return
or
give
any
news
of
myself
for
ten
years
because
i
said
to
him
in
consequence
of
the
agreement
in
which
i
have
entered
with
the
spirits
watching
the
treasure
at
the
first
attempt
made
by
any
other
person
the
casket
containing
the
treasure
will
sink
to
twice
its
present
depth
that
is
to
say
as
deep
as
fathoms
and
then
i
shall
have
myself
ten
times
more
difficulty
in
raising
it
to
the
surface
i
can
not
state
precisely
the
time
of
my
return
for
it
depends
upon
certain
combinations
which
are
not
under
my
control
but
recollect
that
the
treasure
can
not
be
obtained
by
anyone
but
i
i
accompanied
my
advice
with
threats
of
utter
ruin
to
his
family
if
he
should
ever
break
his
oath
and
in
this
manner
i
atoned
for
all
i
had
done
for
far
from
deceiving
the
worthy
man
i
became
his
benefactor
by
guarding
against
the
deceit
of
some
cheat
who
would
have
cared
for
his
money
more
than
for
his
daughter
i
never
saw
him
again
and
most
likely
he
is
dead
but
knowing
the
deep
impression
i
left
on
his
mind
i
am
certain
that
his
descendants
are
even
now
waiting
for
me
for
the
name
of
farusi
must
have
remained
immortal
in
that
family
javotte
accompanied
me
as
far
as
the
gate
of
the
city
where
i
kissed
her
affectionately
which
made
me
feel
that
the
thunder
and
lightning
had
had
but
a
momentary
effect
upon
me
yet
i
kept
control
over
my
senses
and
i
congratulate
myself
on
doing
so
to
this
day
i
told
her
before
bidding
her
adieu
that
her
virginity
being
no
longer
necessary
for
my
magic
operations
i
advised
her
to
get
married
as
soon
as
possible
if
i
did
not
return
within
three
months
she
shed
a
few
tears
but
promised
to
follow
my
advice
i
trust
that
my
readers
will
approve
of
the
noble
manner
in
which
i
concluded
my
magic
business
i
hardly
dare
to
boast
of
it
but
i
think
i
deserve
some
praise
for
my
behaviour
perhaps
i
might
have
ruined
poor
franzia
with
a
light
heart
had
i
not
possessed
a
purse
i
do
not
wish
to
enquire
whether
any
young
man
having
intelligence
loving
pleasure
and
placed
in
the
same
position
would
not
have
done
the
same
but
i
beg
my
readers
to
address
that
question
to
themselves
as
for
capitani
to
whom
i
sold
the
sheath
of
peter
knife
for
rather
more
than
it
was
worth
i
confess
that
i
have
not
yet
repented
on
his
account
for
capitani
thought
he
had
duped
me
in
accepting
it
as
security
for
the
amount
he
gave
me
and
the
count
his
father
valued
it
until
his
death
as
more
precious
than
the
finest
diamond
in
the
world
dying
with
such
a
firm
belief
he
died
rich
and
i
shall
die
a
poor
man
let
the
reader
judge
which
of
the
two
made
the
best
bargain
but
i
must
return
now
to
my
future
travelling
companions
as
soon
as
i
had
reached
the
inn
i
prepared
everything
for
our
departure
for
which
i
was
now
longing
henriette
could
not
open
her
lips
without
my
discovering
some
fresh
perfection
for
her
wit
delighted
me
even
more
than
her
beauty
it
struck
me
that
the
old
captain
was
pleased
with
all
the
attention
i
shewed
her
and
it
seemed
evident
to
me
that
she
would
not
be
sorry
to
exchange
her
elderly
lover
for
me
i
had
all
the
better
right
to
think
so
inasmuch
as
i
was
perfection
from
a
physical
point
of
view
and
i
appeared
to
be
wealthy
although
i
had
no
servant
i
told
henriette
that
for
the
sake
of
having
none
i
spent
twice
as
much
as
a
servant
would
have
cost
me
that
by
my
being
my
own
servant
i
was
certain
of
being
served
according
to
my
taste
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
no
spy
at
my
heels
and
no
privileged
thief
to
fear
she
agreed
with
everything
i
said
and
it
increased
my
love
the
honest
hungarian
insisted
upon
giving
me
in
advance
the
amount
to
be
paid
for
the
at
the
different
stages
as
far
as
parma
we
left
cesena
after
dinner
but
not
without
a
contest
of
politeness
respecting
the
seats
the
captain
wanted
me
to
occupy
the
back
henriette
but
the
reader
will
understand
how
much
better
the
seat
opposite
to
her
suited
me
therefore
i
insisted
upon
taking
the
and
had
the
double
advantage
of
shewing
my
politeness
and
of
having
constantly
and
without
difficulty
before
my
eyes
the
lovely
woman
whom
i
adored
my
happiness
would
have
been
too
great
if
there
had
been
no
drawback
to
it
but
where
can
we
find
roses
without
thorns
when
the
charming
frenchwoman
uttered
some
of
those
witty
sayings
which
proceed
so
naturally
from
the
lips
of
her
countrywomen
i
could
not
help
pitying
the
sorry
face
of
the
poor
hungarian
and
wishing
to
make
him
share
my
mirth
i
would
undertake
to
translate
in
latin
henriette
sallies
but
far
from
making
him
merry
i
often
saw
his
face
bear
a
look
of
astonishment
as
if
what
i
had
said
seemed
to
him
rather
flat
i
had
to
acknowledge
to
myself
that
i
could
not
speak
latin
as
well
as
she
spoke
french
and
this
was
indeed
the
case
the
last
thing
which
we
learn
in
all
languages
is
wit
and
wit
never
shines
so
well
as
in
jests
i
was
thirty
years
of
age
before
i
began
to
laugh
in
reading
terence
plautus
and
martial
something
being
the
matter
with
the
carriage
we
stopped
at
forli
to
have
it
repaired
after
a
very
cheerful
supper
i
retired
to
my
room
to
go
to
bed
thinking
of
nothing
else
but
the
charming
woman
by
whom
i
was
so
completely
captivated
along
the
road
henriette
had
struck
me
as
so
strange
that
i
would
not
sleep
in
the
second
bed
in
their
room
i
was
afraid
lest
she
should
leave
her
old
comrade
to
come
to
my
bed
and
sleep
with
me
and
i
did
not
know
how
far
the
worthy
captain
would
have
put
up
with
such
a
joke
i
wished
of
course
to
possess
that
lovely
creature
but
i
wanted
everything
to
be
settled
amicably
for
i
felt
some
respect
for
the
brave
officer
henriette
had
nothing
but
the
military
costume
in
which
she
stood
not
any
woman
linen
not
even
one
chemise
for
a
change
she
took
the
captain
shirt
such
a
state
of
things
was
so
new
to
me
that
the
situation
seemed
to
me
a
complete
enigma
in
bologna
excited
by
an
excellent
supper
and
by
the
amorous
passion
which
was
every
hour
burning
more
fiercely
in
me
i
asked
her
by
what
singular
adventure
she
had
become
the
friend
of
the
honest
fellow
who
looked
her
father
rather
than
her
lover
if
you
wish
to
know
she
answered
with
a
smile
ask
him
to
relate
the
whole
story
himself
only
you
must
request
him
not
to
omit
any
of
the
particulars
of
course
i
applied
at
once
to
the
captain
and
having
first
ascertained
by
signs
that
the
charming
frenchwoman
had
no
objection
the
good
man
spoke
to
me
thus
a
friend
of
mine
an
officer
in
the
army
having
occasion
to
go
to
rome
i
solicited
a
furlough
of
six
months
and
accompanied
him
i
seized
with
great
delight
the
opportunity
of
visiting
a
city
the
name
of
which
has
a
powerful
influence
on
the
imagination
owing
to
the
memories
of
the
past
attached
to
it
i
did
not
entertain
any
doubt
that
the
latin
language
was
spoken
there
in
good
society
at
least
as
generally
as
in
hungary
but
i
was
indeed
greatly
mistaken
for
nobody
can
speak
it
not
even
the
priests
who
only
pretend
to
write
it
and
it
is
true
that
some
of
them
do
so
with
great
purity
i
was
therefore
rather
uncomfortable
during
my
stay
in
rome
and
with
the
exception
of
my
eyes
my
senses
remained
perfectly
inactive
i
had
spent
a
very
tedious
month
in
that
city
the
ancient
queen
of
the
world
when
cardinal
albani
gave
my
friend
dispatches
for
naples
before
leaving
rome
he
introduced
me
to
his
eminence
and
his
recommendation
had
so
much
influence
that
the
cardinal
promised
to
send
me
very
soon
with
dispatches
for
the
duke
of
parma
piacenza
and
guastalla
assuring
me
that
all
my
travelling
expenses
would
be
defrayed
as
i
wished
to
see
the
harbour
called
in
former
times
centum
cellae
and
now
i
gave
up
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
that
visit
and
i
proceeded
there
with
a
cicerone
who
spoke
latin
i
was
loitering
about
the
harbour
when
i
saw
coming
out
of
a
tartan
an
elderly
officer
and
this
young
woman
dressed
as
she
is
now
her
beauty
struck
me
but
i
should
not
have
thought
any
more
about
it
if
the
officer
had
not
put
up
at
my
inn
and
in
an
apartment
over
which
i
had
a
complete
view
whenever
i
opened
my
window
in
the
evening
i
saw
the
couple
taking
supper
at
the
same
table
but
i
remarked
that
the
elderly
officer
never
addressed
a
word
to
the
young
one
when
the
supper
was
over
the
disguised
girl
left
the
room
and
her
companion
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
a
letter
which
he
was
reading
as
it
seemed
to
me
with
the
deepest
attention
soon
afterwards
the
officer
closed
the
windows
the
light
was
put
out
and
i
suppose
my
neighbors
went
to
bed
the
next
morning
being
up
early
as
is
my
habit
i
saw
the
officer
go
out
and
the
girl
remained
alone
in
the
room
i
sent
my
cicerone
who
was
also
my
servant
to
tell
the
girl
in
the
garb
of
an
officer
that
i
would
give
her
ten
sequins
for
an
conversation
he
fulfilled
my
instructions
and
on
his
return
he
informed
me
that
her
answer
given
in
french
had
been
to
the
effect
that
she
would
leave
for
rome
immediately
after
breakfast
and
that
once
in
that
city
i
should
easily
find
some
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
can
find
out
from
the
vetturino
said
my
cicerone
they
put
up
in
rome
and
i
promise
you
to
enquire
of
him
she
left
with
the
elderly
officer
and
i
returned
home
on
the
following
day
two
days
afterwards
the
cardinal
gave
me
the
dispatches
which
were
addressed
to
dutillot
the
french
minister
with
a
passport
and
the
money
necessary
for
the
journey
he
told
me
with
great
kindness
that
i
need
not
hurry
on
the
road
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
handsome
adventuress
when
two
days
before
my
departure
my
cicerone
gave
me
the
information
that
he
had
found
out
where
she
lived
and
that
she
was
with
the
same
officer
i
told
him
to
try
to
see
her
and
to
let
her
know
that
my
departure
was
fixed
for
the
day
after
the
morrow
she
sent
me
word
by
him
that
if
i
would
inform
her
of
the
hour
of
my
departure
she
would
meet
me
outside
of
the
gate
and
get
into
the
coach
with
me
to
accompany
me
on
my
way
i
thought
the
arrangement
very
ingenious
and
during
the
day
i
sent
the
cicerone
to
tell
her
the
hour
at
which
i
intended
to
leave
and
where
i
would
wait
for
her
outside
of
the
porto
del
popolo
she
came
at
the
appointed
time
and
we
have
remained
together
ever
since
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
near
me
she
made
me
understand
by
signs
that
she
wanted
to
dine
with
me
you
may
imagine
what
difficulty
we
had
in
understanding
one
another
but
we
guessed
somehow
the
meaning
expressed
by
our
pantomime
and
i
accepted
the
adventure
with
delight
we
dined
gaily
together
speaking
without
understanding
but
after
the
dessert
we
comprehended
each
other
very
well
i
fancied
that
i
had
seen
the
end
of
it
and
you
may
imagine
how
surprised
i
was
when
upon
my
offering
her
the
ten
sequins
she
refused
most
positively
to
take
any
money
making
me
understand
that
she
would
rather
go
with
me
to
parma
because
she
had
some
business
in
that
city
and
did
not
want
to
return
to
rome
the
proposal
was
after
all
rather
agreeable
to
me
i
consented
to
her
wishes
i
only
regretted
my
inability
to
make
her
understand
that
if
she
was
followed
by
anyone
from
rome
and
if
that
person
wanted
to
take
her
back
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
defend
her
against
violence
i
was
also
sorry
that
with
our
mutual
ignorance
of
the
language
spoken
by
each
of
us
we
had
no
opportunity
of
conversation
for
i
should
have
been
greatly
pleased
to
hear
her
adventures
which
i
think
must
be
interesting
you
can
of
course
guess
that
i
have
no
idea
of
who
she
can
be
i
only
know
that
she
calls
herself
henriette
that
she
must
be
a
frenchwoman
that
she
is
as
gentle
as
a
turtledove
that
she
has
evidently
received
a
good
education
and
that
she
enjoys
good
health
she
is
witty
and
courageous
as
we
have
both
seen
i
in
rome
and
you
in
cesena
at
general
table
if
she
would
tell
you
her
history
and
allow
you
to
translate
it
for
me
in
latin
she
would
indeed
please
me
much
for
i
am
sincerely
her
friend
and
i
can
assure
you
that
it
will
grieve
me
to
part
from
her
in
parma
please
to
tell
her
that
i
intend
to
give
her
the
thirty
sequins
i
received
from
the
bishop
of
cesena
and
that
if
i
were
rich
i
would
give
her
more
substantial
proofs
of
my
tender
affection
now
sir
i
shall
feel
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
explain
it
all
to
her
in
french
i
asked
her
whether
she
would
feel
offended
if
i
gave
her
an
exact
translation
she
assured
me
that
on
the
contrary
she
wished
me
to
speak
openly
and
i
told
her
literally
what
the
captain
had
related
to
me
with
a
noble
frankness
which
a
slight
shade
rendered
more
interesting
henriette
confirmed
the
truth
of
her
friend
narrative
but
she
begged
me
to
tell
him
that
she
could
not
grant
his
wish
respecting
the
adventures
of
her
life
be
good
enough
to
inform
him
she
added
that
the
same
principle
which
forbids
me
to
utter
a
falsehood
does
not
allow
me
to
tell
the
truth
as
for
the
thirty
sequins
which
he
intends
to
give
me
i
will
not
accept
even
one
of
them
and
he
would
deeply
grieve
me
by
pressing
them
upon
me
the
moment
we
reach
parma
i
wish
him
to
allow
me
to
lodge
wherever
i
may
please
to
make
no
enquiries
whatever
about
me
and
in
case
he
should
happen
to
meet
me
to
crown
his
great
kindness
to
me
by
not
appearing
to
have
ever
known
me
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
of
this
short
speech
which
she
had
delivered
very
seriously
and
with
a
mixture
of
modesty
and
resolution
she
kissed
her
elderly
friend
in
a
manner
which
indicated
esteem
and
gratitude
rather
than
love
the
captain
who
did
not
know
why
she
was
kissing
him
was
deeply
grieved
when
i
translated
what
henriette
had
said
he
begged
me
to
tell
her
that
if
he
was
to
obey
her
with
an
easy
conscience
he
must
know
whether
she
would
have
everything
she
required
in
parma
you
can
assure
him
she
answered
that
he
need
not
entertain
any
anxiety
about
me
this
conversation
had
made
us
all
very
sad
we
remained
for
a
long
time
thoughtful
and
silent
until
feeling
the
situation
to
be
painful
i
rose
wishing
them
good
night
and
i
saw
that
henriette
face
wore
a
look
of
great
excitement
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
alone
in
my
room
deeply
moved
by
conflicting
feelings
of
love
surprise
and
uncertainty
i
began
to
give
vent
to
my
feelings
in
a
kind
of
soliloquy
as
i
always
do
when
i
am
strongly
excited
by
anything
thinking
is
not
in
those
cases
enough
for
me
i
must
speak
aloud
and
i
throw
so
much
action
so
much
animation
into
these
monologues
that
i
forget
i
am
alone
what
i
knew
now
of
henriette
had
upset
me
altogether
who
can
she
be
i
said
speaking
to
the
walls
this
girl
who
seems
to
have
the
most
elevated
feelings
under
the
veil
of
the
most
cynical
libertinism
she
says
that
in
parma
she
wishes
to
remain
perfectly
unknown
her
own
mistress
and
i
can
not
of
course
flatter
myself
that
she
will
not
place
me
under
the
same
restrictions
as
the
captain
to
whom
she
has
already
abandoned
herself
goodbye
to
my
expectations
to
my
money
and
my
illusions
but
who
is
she
what
is
she
she
must
have
either
a
lover
or
a
husband
in
parma
or
she
must
belong
to
a
respectable
family
or
perhaps
thanks
to
a
boundless
love
for
debauchery
and
to
her
confidence
in
her
own
charms
she
intends
to
set
fortune
misery
and
degradation
at
defiance
and
to
try
to
enslave
some
wealthy
nobleman
but
that
would
be
the
plan
of
a
mad
woman
or
of
a
person
reduced
to
utter
despair
and
it
does
not
seem
to
be
the
case
with
henriette
yet
she
possesses
nothing
true
but
she
refused
as
if
she
had
been
provided
with
all
she
needed
the
kind
assistance
of
a
man
who
has
the
right
to
offer
it
and
from
whom
in
sooth
she
can
accept
without
blushing
since
she
has
not
been
ashamed
to
grant
him
favours
with
which
love
had
nothing
to
do
does
she
think
that
it
is
less
shameful
for
a
woman
to
abandon
herself
to
the
desires
of
a
man
unknown
and
unloved
than
to
receive
a
present
from
an
esteemed
friend
and
particularly
at
the
eve
of
finding
herself
in
the
street
entirely
destitute
in
the
middle
of
a
foreign
city
amongst
people
whose
language
she
can
not
even
speak
perhaps
she
thinks
that
such
conduct
will
justify
the
pas
of
which
she
has
been
guilty
with
the
captain
and
give
him
to
understand
that
she
had
abandoned
herself
to
him
only
for
the
sake
of
escaping
from
the
officer
with
whom
she
was
in
rome
but
she
ought
to
be
quite
certain
that
the
captain
does
not
entertain
any
other
idea
he
shews
himself
so
reasonable
that
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
he
ever
admitted
the
possibility
of
having
inspired
her
with
a
violent
passion
because
she
had
seen
him
once
through
a
window
in
she
might
possibly
be
right
and
feel
herself
justified
in
her
conduct
towards
the
captain
but
it
is
not
the
same
with
me
for
with
her
intelligence
she
must
be
aware
that
i
would
not
have
travelled
with
them
if
she
had
been
indifferent
to
me
and
she
must
know
that
there
is
but
one
way
in
which
she
can
obtain
my
pardon
she
may
be
endowed
with
many
virtues
but
she
has
not
the
only
one
which
could
prevent
me
from
wishing
the
reward
which
every
man
expects
to
receive
at
the
hands
of
the
woman
he
loves
if
she
wants
to
assume
prudish
manners
towards
me
and
to
make
a
dupe
of
me
i
am
bound
in
honour
to
shew
her
how
much
she
is
mistaken
after
this
monologue
which
had
made
me
still
more
angry
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
an
explanation
in
the
morning
before
our
departure
i
shall
ask
her
said
i
to
myself
to
grant
me
the
same
favours
which
she
has
so
easily
granted
to
her
old
captain
and
if
i
meet
with
a
refusal
the
best
revenge
will
be
to
shew
her
a
cold
and
profound
contempt
until
our
arrival
in
parma
i
felt
sure
that
she
could
not
refuse
me
some
marks
of
real
or
of
pretended
affection
unless
she
wished
to
make
a
show
of
a
modesty
which
certainly
did
not
belong
to
her
and
knowing
that
her
modesty
would
only
be
all
pretence
i
was
determined
not
to
be
a
mere
toy
in
her
hands
as
for
the
captain
i
felt
certain
from
what
he
had
told
me
that
he
would
not
be
angry
with
me
if
i
risked
a
declaration
for
as
a
sensible
man
he
could
only
assume
a
neutral
position
satisfied
with
my
wise
reasoning
and
with
my
mind
fully
made
up
i
fell
asleep
my
thoughts
were
too
completely
absorbed
by
henriette
for
her
not
to
haunt
my
dreams
but
the
dream
which
i
had
throughout
the
night
was
so
much
like
reality
that
on
awaking
i
looked
for
her
in
my
bed
and
my
imagination
was
so
deeply
struck
with
the
delights
of
that
night
that
if
my
door
had
not
been
fastened
with
a
bolt
i
should
have
believed
that
she
had
left
me
during
my
sleep
to
resume
her
place
near
the
worthy
hungarian
when
i
was
awake
i
found
that
the
happy
dream
of
the
night
had
turned
my
love
for
the
lovely
creature
into
a
perfect
amorous
frenzy
and
it
could
not
be
other
wise
let
the
reader
imagine
a
poor
devil
going
to
bed
broken
down
with
fatigue
and
starvation
he
succumbs
to
sleep
that
most
imperative
of
all
human
wants
but
in
his
dream
he
finds
himself
before
a
table
covered
with
every
delicacy
what
will
then
happen
why
a
very
natural
result
his
appetite
much
more
lively
than
on
the
previous
day
does
not
give
him
a
minute
rest
he
must
satisfy
it
or
die
of
sheer
hunger
i
dressed
myself
resolved
on
making
sure
of
the
possession
of
the
woman
who
had
inflamed
all
my
senses
even
before
resuming
our
journey
if
i
do
not
succeed
i
said
to
myself
i
will
not
go
one
step
further
but
in
order
not
to
offend
against
propriety
and
not
to
deserve
the
reproaches
of
an
honest
man
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
have
an
explanation
with
the
captain
in
the
first
place
i
fancy
that
i
hear
one
of
those
sensible
calm
passionless
readers
who
have
had
the
advantage
of
what
is
called
a
youth
without
storms
or
one
of
those
whom
old
age
has
forced
to
become
virtuous
exclaim
can
anyone
attach
so
much
importance
to
such
nonsense
age
has
calmed
my
passions
down
by
rendering
them
powerless
but
my
heart
has
not
grown
old
and
my
memory
has
kept
all
the
freshness
of
youth
and
far
from
considering
that
sort
of
thing
a
mere
trifle
my
only
sorrow
dear
reader
arises
from
the
fact
that
i
have
not
the
power
to
practise
to
the
day
of
my
death
that
which
has
been
the
principal
affair
of
my
life
when
i
was
ready
i
repaired
to
the
chamber
occupied
by
my
two
travelling
companions
and
after
paying
each
of
them
the
usual
morning
compliments
i
told
the
officer
that
i
was
deeply
in
love
with
henriette
and
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
object
to
my
trying
to
obtain
her
as
my
mistress
the
reason
for
which
she
begs
you
i
added
to
leave
her
in
parma
and
not
to
take
any
further
notice
of
her
must
be
that
she
hopes
to
meet
some
lover
of
hers
there
let
me
have
half
an
hour
conversation
with
her
and
i
flatter
myself
i
can
persuade
her
to
sacrifice
that
lover
for
me
if
she
refuses
me
i
remain
here
you
will
go
with
her
to
parma
where
you
will
leave
my
carriage
at
the
post
only
sending
me
a
receipt
so
that
i
can
claim
it
whenever
i
please
as
soon
as
breakfast
is
over
said
the
excellent
man
i
shall
go
and
visit
the
institute
and
leave
you
alone
with
henriette
i
hope
you
may
succeed
for
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
her
under
your
protection
when
i
part
with
her
should
she
persist
in
her
first
resolution
i
could
easily
find
a
here
and
you
could
keep
your
carriage
i
thank
you
for
your
proposal
and
it
will
grieve
me
to
leave
you
highly
pleased
at
having
accomplished
half
of
my
task
and
at
seeing
myself
near
the
denouement
i
asked
the
lovely
frenchwoman
whether
she
would
like
to
see
the
sights
of
bologna
i
should
like
it
very
much
she
said
if
i
had
some
other
clothes
but
with
such
a
costume
as
this
i
do
not
care
to
shew
myself
about
the
city
then
you
do
not
want
to
go
out
no
can
i
keep
you
company
that
would
be
delightful
the
captain
went
out
immediately
after
breakfast
the
moment
he
had
gone
i
told
henriette
that
her
friend
had
left
us
alone
purposely
so
as
to
give
me
the
opportunity
of
a
private
interview
with
her
tell
me
now
whether
you
intended
the
order
which
you
gave
him
yesterday
to
forget
you
never
to
enquire
after
you
and
even
not
to
know
you
if
he
happened
to
meet
you
from
the
time
of
our
arrival
in
parma
for
me
as
well
as
for
him
it
is
not
an
order
that
i
gave
him
i
have
no
right
to
do
so
and
i
could
not
so
far
forget
myself
it
is
only
a
prayer
i
addressed
to
him
a
service
which
circumstances
have
compelled
me
to
claim
at
his
hands
and
as
he
has
no
right
to
refuse
me
i
never
entertained
any
doubt
of
his
granting
my
command
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
it
is
certain
that
i
should
have
addressed
the
same
prayer
to
you
if
i
had
thought
that
you
had
any
views
about
me
you
have
given
me
some
marks
of
your
friendship
but
you
must
understand
that
if
under
the
circumstances
i
am
likely
to
be
injured
by
the
kind
attentions
of
the
captain
yours
would
injure
me
much
more
if
you
have
any
friendship
for
me
you
would
have
felt
all
that
as
you
know
that
i
entertain
great
friendship
for
you
you
can
not
possibly
suppose
that
i
would
leave
you
alone
without
money
without
resources
in
the
middle
of
a
city
where
you
can
not
even
make
yourself
understood
do
you
think
that
a
man
who
feels
for
you
the
most
tender
affection
can
abandon
you
when
he
has
been
fortunate
enough
to
make
your
acquaintance
when
he
is
aware
of
the
sad
position
in
which
you
are
placed
if
you
think
such
a
thing
possible
you
must
have
a
very
false
idea
of
friendship
and
should
such
a
man
grant
your
request
he
would
only
prove
that
he
is
not
your
friend
i
am
certain
that
the
captain
is
my
friend
yet
you
have
heard
him
he
will
obey
me
and
forget
me
i
do
not
know
what
sort
of
affection
that
honest
man
feels
for
you
or
how
far
he
can
rely
upon
the
control
he
may
have
over
himself
but
i
know
that
if
he
can
grant
you
what
you
have
asked
from
him
his
friendship
must
be
of
a
nature
very
different
from
mine
for
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
it
is
not
only
impossible
for
me
to
afford
you
willingly
the
strange
gratification
of
abandoning
you
in
your
position
but
even
that
if
i
go
to
parma
you
could
not
possibly
carry
out
your
wishes
because
i
love
you
so
passionately
that
you
must
promise
to
be
mine
or
i
must
remain
here
in
that
case
you
must
go
to
parma
alone
with
the
captain
for
i
feel
that
if
i
accompanied
you
any
further
i
should
soon
be
the
most
wretched
of
men
i
could
not
bear
to
see
you
with
another
lover
with
a
husband
not
even
in
the
midst
of
your
family
in
fact
i
would
fain
see
you
and
live
with
you
forever
let
me
tell
you
lovely
henriette
that
if
it
is
possible
for
a
frenchman
to
forget
an
italian
can
not
do
it
at
least
if
i
judge
from
my
own
feelings
i
have
made
up
my
mind
you
must
be
good
enough
to
decide
now
and
to
tell
me
whether
i
am
to
accompany
you
or
to
remain
here
answer
yes
or
no
if
i
remain
here
it
is
all
over
i
shall
leave
for
naples
and
i
know
i
shall
be
cured
in
time
of
the
mad
passion
i
feel
for
you
but
if
you
tell
me
that
i
can
accompany
you
to
parma
you
must
promise
me
that
your
heart
will
forever
belong
to
me
alone
i
must
be
the
only
one
to
possess
you
but
i
am
ready
to
accept
as
a
condition
if
you
like
that
you
shall
not
crown
my
happiness
until
you
have
judged
me
worthy
of
it
by
my
attentions
and
by
my
loving
care
now
be
kind
enough
to
decide
before
the
return
of
the
too
happy
captain
he
knows
all
for
i
have
told
him
what
i
feel
and
what
did
he
answer
that
he
would
be
happy
to
see
you
under
my
protection
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
smile
playing
on
your
lips
pray
allow
me
to
laugh
for
i
have
never
in
my
life
realized
the
idea
of
a
furious
declaration
of
love
do
you
understand
what
it
is
to
say
to
a
woman
in
a
declaration
which
ought
to
be
passionate
but
at
the
same
time
tender
and
gentle
the
following
terrible
words
make
your
choice
either
one
or
the
other
and
decide
instanter
ha
ha
ha
yes
i
understand
perfectly
it
is
neither
gentle
nor
gallant
nor
pathetic
but
it
is
passionate
remember
that
this
is
a
serious
matter
and
that
i
have
never
yet
found
myself
so
much
pressed
by
time
can
you
on
your
side
realize
the
painful
position
of
a
man
who
being
deeply
in
love
finds
himself
compelled
to
take
a
decision
which
may
perhaps
decide
issues
of
life
and
death
be
good
enough
to
remark
that
in
spite
of
the
passion
raging
in
me
i
do
not
fail
in
the
respect
i
owe
you
that
the
resolution
i
intend
to
take
if
you
should
persist
in
your
original
decision
is
not
a
threat
but
an
effort
worthy
of
a
hero
which
ought
to
call
for
your
esteem
i
beg
of
you
to
consider
that
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
time
the
word
choose
must
not
sound
harshly
in
your
ears
since
it
leaves
my
fate
as
well
as
yours
entirely
in
your
hands
to
feel
certain
of
my
love
do
you
want
to
see
me
kneeling
before
you
like
a
simpleton
crying
and
entreating
you
to
take
pity
on
me
no
madam
that
would
certainly
displease
you
and
it
would
not
help
me
i
am
conscious
of
being
worthy
of
your
love
i
therefore
ask
for
that
feeling
and
not
for
pity
leave
me
if
i
displease
you
but
let
me
go
away
for
if
you
are
humane
enough
to
wish
that
i
should
forget
you
allow
me
to
go
far
away
from
you
so
as
to
make
my
sorrow
less
immense
should
i
follow
you
to
parma
i
would
not
answer
for
myself
for
i
might
give
way
to
my
despair
consider
everything
well
i
beseech
you
you
would
indeed
be
guilty
of
great
cruelty
were
you
to
answer
now
to
parma
although
i
must
beg
of
you
not
to
see
me
in
that
city
confess
that
you
can
not
in
all
fairness
give
me
such
an
answer
am
i
not
right
certainly
if
you
truly
love
me
good
god
if
i
love
you
oh
yes
believe
me
my
love
is
immense
sincere
now
decide
my
fate
what
always
the
same
song
yes
but
are
you
aware
that
you
look
very
angry
no
for
it
is
not
so
i
am
only
in
a
state
of
uncontrollable
excitement
in
one
of
the
decisive
hours
of
my
life
a
prey
to
the
most
fearful
anxiety
i
ought
to
curse
my
whimsical
destiny
and
the
of
cesena
may
god
curse
them
too
for
without
them
i
should
never
have
known
you
are
you
then
so
very
sorry
to
have
made
my
acquaintance
have
i
not
some
reason
to
be
so
no
for
i
have
not
given
you
my
decision
yet
now
i
breathe
more
freely
for
i
am
sure
you
will
tell
me
to
accompany
you
to
parma
yes
come
to
parma
