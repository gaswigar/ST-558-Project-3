henri
explained
the
method
that
i
should
have
hurt
you
so
he
said
softly
that

might

again
i
the
stage
on
which
we
play
our
little
dramas
of
life
and
love
has
for
most
of
us
but
one
setting
it
is
furnished
out
with
approximately
the
same
things
characters
come
move
about
and
make
their
final
exits
through
doors
and
the
back
drop
remains
approximately
the
same
from
beginning
to
end
palace
or
hovel
forest
or
sea
it
is
the
background
for
the
moving
figures
of
the
play
so
sara
lee
kennedy
had
a
back
drop
that
had
every
appearance
of
permanency
the
great
scene
painter
apparently
intended
that
there
should
be
no
change
of
set
for
her
sara
lee
herself
certainly
expected
none
but
now
and
then
amazing
things
are
done
on
this
great
stage
of
ours
lights
go
down
the
back
drop
which
had
given
the
illusion
of
solidity
reveals
itself
transparent
a
sort
of
fairyland
transformation
takes
place
beyond
the
once
solid
wall
strange
figures
move
on
a
new
en
with
the
old
blotted
out
in
darkness
the
lady
whom
we
left
knitting
by
the
fire
becomes
a
fairy
sara
lee
became
a
fairy
of
a
sort
and
meets
the
prince
adventure
too
and
love
of
course
and
then
the
lights
go
out
and
it
is
the
same
old
back
drop
again
and
the
lady
is
back
by
the
fire
but
with
a
memory
this
is
the
story
of
sara
lee
kennedy
memory
and
of
something
more
the
early
days
of
the
great
war
saw
sara
lee
playing
her
part
in
the
setting
of
a
city
in
pennsylvania
an
ugly
city
but
a
wealthy
one
it
is
only
fair
to
sara
lee
to
say
that
she
shared
in
neither
quality
she
was
far
from
ugly
and
very
very
far
from
rich
she
had
started
her
part
with
a
full
stage
to
carry
on
the
figure
but
one
by
one
they
had
gone
away
into
the
wings
and
had
not
come
back
at
nineteen
she
was
alone
knitting
by
the
fire
with
no
idea
whatever
that
the
back
drop
was
of
painted
net
and
that
beyond
it
waiting
for
its
moment
was
the
forest
of
adventure
a
strange
forest
too
one
that
sara
lee
would
not
have
recognised
as
a
forest
and
a
prince
of
course
but
a
prince
as
strange
and
mysterious
as
the
forest
the
end
of
december
found
sara
lee
quite
contented
if
it
was
resignation
rather
than
content
no
one
but
sara
lee
knew
the
difference
knitting
too
but
not
for
soldiers
she
was
to
be
candid
knitting
an
afghan
against
an
interesting
event
which
involved
a
friend
of
hers
sara
lee
rather
deplored
the
event
in
her
own
mind
of
course
for
in
her
small
circle
young
unmarried
women
accepted
the
major
events
of
life
without
question
and
certainly
without
conversation
she
never
for
instance
allowed
her
uncle
james
with
whom
she
lived
to
see
her
working
at
the
afghan
and
even
her
aunt
harriet
had
supposed
it
to
be
a
sweater
until
it
assumed
uncompromising
proportions
sara
lee
days
up
to
the
twentieth
of
december
had
been
much
alike
in
the
mornings
she
straightened
up
her
room
which
she
had
copied
from
one
in
a
woman
magazine
with
the
result
that
it
gave
somehow
the
impression
of
a
baby
bassinet
being
largely
dotted
swiss
and
ribbon
yet
in
a
way
it
was
a
perfect
setting
for
sara
lee
herself
it
was
fresh
and
virginal
and
very
very
neat
and
white
a
resigned
little
room
like
sara
lee
resigned
to
being
tucked
away
in
a
corner
and
to
having
no
particular
outlook
peaceful
too
sometimes
in
the
morning
between
straightening
her
room
and
going
to
the
market
for
aunt
harriet
sara
lee
looked
at
a
newspaper
so
she
knew
there
was
a
war
she
read
the
headings
and
when
the
matter
came
up
for
mention
at
the
little
afternoon
bridge
club
as
it
did
now
and
then
after
the
prizes
were
distributed
she
always
said
is
it
horrible
and
changed
the
subject
on
the
night
of
the
nineteenth
of
december
sara
lee
had
read
her
chapter
in
the
bible
she
read
it
through
once
each
year
and
had
braided
down
her
hair
which
was
as
smooth
and
shining
and
lovely
as
sara
lee
herself
and
had
raised
her
window
for
the
night
when
aunt
harriet
came
in
sara
lee
did
not
know
at
first
that
she
had
a
visitor
she
stood
looking
out
toward
the
east
until
aunt
harriet
touched
her
on
the
arm
what
in
the
world
said
aunt
harriet
a
body
would
suppose
it
was
august
i
was
just
thinking
said
sara
lee
you
better
do
your
thinking
in
bed
jump
in
and
i
put
out
your
light
so
sara
lee
got
into
her
white
bed
with
the
dotted
swiss
valance
and
drew
the
covers
to
her
chin
and
looked
a
scant
sixteen
aunt
harriet
who
was
an
unsentimental
woman
childless
and
diffident
found
her
suddenly
very
appealing
there
in
her
smooth
bed
and
did
an
unexpected
thing
she
kissed
her
then
feeling
extremely
uncomfortable
she
put
out
the
light
and
went
to
the
door
there
she
paused
thinking
she
said
what
about
sara
lee
perhaps
it
was
because
the
light
was
out
that
sara
lee
became
articulate
perhaps
it
was
because
things
that
had
been
forming
in
her
young
mind
for
weeks
had
at
last
crystallized
into
words
perhaps
it
was
because
of
a
picture
she
had
happened
on
that
day
of
a
boy
lying
wounded
somewhere
on
a
battlefield
and
calling
mother
about
over
there
she
said
rather
hesitatingly
and
about
anna
over
there
the
war
said
sara
lee
i
was
just
thinking
about
all
those
women
over
there
like
anna
you
know
they
they
had
babies
and
got
everything
ready
for
them
and
then
the
babies
grew
up
and
they
all
getting
killed
it
horrible
said
aunt
harriet
do
you
want
another
blanket
cold
sara
lee
did
not
wish
another
blanket
i
a
little
worried
about
your
uncle
james
said
aunt
harriet
at
the
door
he
got
indigestion
i
think
i
make
him
a
mustard
plaster
she
prepared
to
go
out
then
but
sara
lee
spoke
from
her
white
bed
aunt
harriet
she
said
i
do
think
i
ever
get
married
i
said
that
too
once
said
aunt
harriet
complacently
what
got
into
your
head
now
i
do
know
sara
lee
replied
vaguely
i
just
what
the
use
aunt
harriet
was
conscious
of
a
hazy
impression
of
indelicacy
coming
from
sara
lee
it
was
startling
and
revolutionary
in
aunt
world
young
women
did
not
question
their
duty
which
was
to
marry
preferably
some
one
in
the
neighborhood
and
bear
children
who
would
be
wheeled
about
that
same
neighborhood
in
perambulators
and
who
would
ultimately
grow
up
and
look
after
themselves
the
use
she
asked
tartly
of
having
babies
and
getting
to
care
about
them
and
then
there
will
always
be
wars
wo
there
you
turn
over
and
go
to
sleep
counseled
aunt
harriet
and
stop
looking
twenty
years
or
more
ahead
she
hesitated
you
quarreled
with
harvey
have
you
sara
lee
turned
over
obediently
no
it
not
that
she
said
and
the
door
closed
perhaps
had
she
ever
had
time
during
the
crowded
months
that
followed
sara
lee
would
have
dated
certain
things
from
that
cold
frosty
night
in
december
when
she
began
to
question
things
for
after
all
that
was
what
it
came
to
she
did
not
revolt
she
questioned
she
lay
in
her
white
bed
and
looked
at
things
for
the
first
time
the
sky
had
seemed
low
that
night
things
were
nearer
the
horizon
was
close
and
beyond
that
peaceful
horizon
to
the
east
something
was
going
on
that
could
not
be
ignored
men
were
dying
killing
and
dying
men
who
had
been
waited
for
as
anna
watched
for
her
child
downstairs
she
could
hear
aunt
harriet
moving
about
the
street
was
quiet
until
a
crowd
of
young
people
she
knew
them
by
their
voices
went
by
laughing
it
horrible
said
sara
lee
to
herself
there
was
a
change
in
her
but
she
was
still
inarticulate
somewhere
in
her
mind
but
not
formulated
was
the
feeling
that
she
was
too
comfortable
her
peace
was
a
cheap
peace
bought
at
no
price
her
last
waking
determination
was
to
finish
the
afghan
quickly
and
to
knit
for
the
men
at
the
war
uncle
james
was
ill
the
next
morning
sara
lee
went
for
the
doctor
but
anna
hour
had
come
and
he
was
with
her
late
in
the
afternoon
he
came
however
looking
a
bit
gray
round
the
mouth
with
fatigue
but
triumphant
he
had
on
these
occasions
always
a
sense
of
victory
even
in
a
way
a
feeling
of
being
part
of
a
great
purpose
he
talked
at
such
times
of
the
race
as
one
may
who
is
doing
his
best
by
it
well
he
said
when
sara
lee
opened
the
door
it
a
boy
eight
pounds
going
to
be
too
he
chuckled
a
boy
said
sara
lee
i
do
you
bring
any
girl
babies
any
more
the
doctor
put
down
his
hat
and
glanced
at
her
wanted
a
girl
to
be
named
for
you
no
it
not
that
it
only
she
checked
herself
he
understand
the
race
required
girl
babies
i
put
a
blue
bow
on
my
afghan
pink
is
for
boys
she
said
and
led
the
way
upstairs
very
simple
and
orderly
was
the
small
house
as
simple
and
orderly
as
sara
lee
days
in
it
time
was
to
come
when
sara
lee
having
left
it
ached
for
it
with
every
fiber
of
her
body
and
her
soul
for
its
bright
curtains
and
fresh
paint
its
regularity
its
shining
brasses
and
growing
plants
its
very
kitchen
pans
and
oilcloth
she
was
to
ache
too
for
her
friends
their
small
engrossing
cares
their
kindly
interest
their
familiar
faces
time
was
to
come
too
when
she
came
back
not
to
the
little
house
it
is
true
but
to
her
friends
to
anna
and
the
others
but
they
had
not
grown
and
sara
lee
had
and
that
is
the
story
uncle
james
died
the
next
day
one
moment
he
was
there
an
uneasy
figure
under
the
tulip
quilt
and
the
next
he
had
gone
away
entirely
leaving
a
terrible
quiet
behind
him
he
had
been
the
center
of
the
little
house
a
big
and
cheery
and
not
center
followed
his
going
not
only
quiet
but
a
wretched
tidiness
there
was
nothing
for
sara
lee
to
do
but
to
think
and
in
the
way
of
mourning
women
things
that
uncle
james
had
said
which
had
passed
unheeded
came
back
to
her
one
of
them
was
when
he
had
proposed
to
adopt
a
belgian
child
and
aunt
harriet
had
offered
horrified
protest
all
right
he
had
said
of
course
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
but
i
feel
kind
of
mean
sometimes
sitting
here
doing
nothing
when
there
such
a
lot
to
be
done
then
he
had
gone
for
a
walk
and
had
come
back
cheerful
enough
but
rather
quiet
there
was
that
other
time
too
when
the
german
army
was
hurling
itself
wave
after
wave
across
the
yser
only
of
course
sara
lee
knew
nothing
of
the
yser
then
and
when
it
seemed
as
though
the
attenuated
allied
line
must
surely
crack
and
give
he
had
said
then
that
if
he
were
only
twenty
years
younger
he
would
go
across
and
help
and
what
about
me
aunt
harriet
had
asked
but
i
suppose
i
matter
you
could
go
to
jennie
could
you
there
had
followed
one
of
those
absurd
wrangles
as
to
whether
or
not
aunt
harriet
would
go
to
jennie
in
the
rather
remote
contingency
of
uncle
james
becoming
twenty
years
younger
and
going
away
and
now
uncle
james
had
taken
on
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
was
indeed
gone
away
and
again
it
became
a
question
of
jennie
aunt
harriet
rather
dazed
at
first
took
to
arguing
it
pro
and
con
of
course
she
has
room
for
me
she
would
say
in
her
thin
voice
there
that
little
room
that
was
edgar
there
nobody
in
it
now
but
there
only
room
for
a
single
bed
sara
lee
sara
lee
was
knitting
socks
now
all
a
trifle
tight
as
to
heel
i
know
she
would
say
i
get
along
do
you
worry
about
me
always
these
talks
ended
on
a
note
of
exasperation
for
aunt
harriet
for
sara
lee
statement
that
she
could
manage
would
draw
forth
a
plaintive
burst
from
the
older
woman
if
only
you
marry
harvey
she
would
say
i
do
know
what
come
over
you
you
used
to
like
him
well
enough
i
still
like
him
i
seen
you
jump
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
your
uncle
james
often
spoke
about
it
he
noticed
more
than
most
people
thought
she
followed
sara
lee
eyes
down
the
street
to
where
anna
was
wheeling
her
baby
slowly
up
and
down
even
from
that
distance
sara
lee
could
see
the
bit
of
pink
which
was
the
bow
on
her
afghan
i
believe
you
afraid
afraid
of
having
children
accused
aunt
harriet
fretfully
sara
lee
colored
perhaps
i
am
she
said
but
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
think
i
just
do
see
the
use
of
it
that
all
aunt
harriet
how
long
does
it
take
to
become
a
hospital
nurse
mabel
andrews
was
three
years
it
spoiled
her
looks
too
she
used
to
be
a
right
pretty
girl
three
years
sara
lee
reflected
by
that
time
the
house
was
very
quiet
and
still
those
days
there
was
an
interlude
of
emptiness
and
order
of
long
days
during
which
aunt
harriet
alternately
grieved
and
planned
and
sara
lee
thought
of
many
things
at
the
red
cross
meetings
all
sorts
of
stories
were
circulated
the
belgian
atrocity
tales
had
just
reached
the
country
and
were
spreading
like
wildfire
there
were
arguments
and
disagreements
a
girl
named
schmidt
was
militant
against
them
and
soon
found
herself
a
small
island
of
defiance
entirely
surrounded
by
disapproval
mabel
andrews
came
once
to
a
meeting
and
in
businesslike
fashion
explained
the
red
cross
dressings
and
gave
a
lesson
in
bandaging
forerunner
of
the
many
classes
to
come
was
that
hour
of
mabel
and
made
memorable
by
one
thing
she
said
you
might
as
well
all
get
busy
and
learn
to
do
such
things
she
stated
in
her
brisk
voice
one
of
our
is
over
there
and
he
says
we
be
in
it
before
spring
after
the
meeting
sara
lee
went
up
to
mabel
and
put
a
hand
on
her
arm
are
you
going
she
asked
leaving
day
after
why
i
could
i
be
useful
over
there
mabel
smiled
rather
grimly
what
can
you
do
i
can
cook
only
men
cooks
my
dear
what
else
i
could
clean
up
could
i
there
must
be
something
i
do
anything
i
could
do
they
have
people
to
wash
dishes
and
all
that
mabel
was
on
doubtful
ground
there
she
knew
of
a
woman
who
had
been
permitted
to
take
over
her
own
automobile
paying
all
her
expenses
and
buying
her
own
tires
and
gasoline
she
carries
supplies
to
small
hospitals
in
places
she
said
but
i
do
suppose
you
can
do
that
sara
lee
can
you
however
she
gave
sara
lee
a
new
york
address
and
sara
lee
wrote
and
offered
herself
she
said
nothing
to
aunt
harriet
who
had
by
that
time
elected
to
take
edgar
room
at
cousin
jennie
and
was
putting
uncle
james
clothes
in
tearful
order
to
send
to
belgium
after
a
time
she
received
a
reply
we
have
put
your
name
on
our
list
of
volunteers
said
the
letter
but
of
course
you
understand
that
only
trained
workers
are
needed
now
france
and
england
are
full
of
untrained
women
who
are
eager
to
help
it
was
that
night
that
sara
lee
became
engaged
to
harvey
sara
lee
attitude
toward
harvey
was
one
that
she
never
tried
to
analyze
when
he
was
not
with
her
she
thought
of
him
tenderly
romantically
this
was
perhaps
due
to
the
photograph
of
him
on
her
mantel
there
was
a
dash
about
the
picture
rather
lacking
in
the
original
for
it
was
a
profile
and
in
it
the
young
man
longish
hair
worn
pompadour
the
slight
thrust
forward
of
the
head
the
arch
of
the
nostrils
gave
him
a
sort
of
tense
eagerness
a
look
of
running
against
the
wind
from
the
photograph
harvey
might
have
been
a
gladiator
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
a
bond
salesman
so
during
the
daytime
sara
lee
looked
at
intervals
at
the
photograph
and
got
that
feel
of
drive
and
force
and
in
the
evenings
harvey
came
and
she
lost
it
for
outside
of
a
frame
he
became
a
rather
sturdy
figure
of
no
romance
but
of
a
comforting
solidity
a
kindly
young
man
with
a
rather
wide
face
and
hands
disfigured
as
to
fingers
by
much
early
baseball
he
had
heavy
shoulders
the
sort
a
girl
might
rely
on
to
carry
many
burdens
a
younger
and
tidier
uncle
james
indeed
the
same
cheery
manner
the
same
robust
integrity
and
the
same
small
ambition
to
earn
enough
to
keep
those
dependent
on
him
and
to
do
it
fairly
to
tell
the
truth
and
wear
clean
linen
and
not
run
into
debt
and
to
marry
sara
lee
and
love
and
cherish
her
all
his
life
this
was
harvey
a
plain
and
likable
man
a
lover
and
husband
to
be
sure
of
but
he
came
that
night
to
see
sara
lee
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
that
he
came
every
night
but
he
came
that
night
full
of
determination
that
was
not
unusual
either
but
it
had
not
carried
him
far
he
had
no
idea
that
his
picture
was
romantic
he
would
have
demanded
it
back
had
he
so
much
as
suspected
it
he
wore
his
hair
in
a
pompadour
because
of
the
prosaic
fact
that
he
had
a
he
was
very
humble
about
himself
and
sara
lee
was
to
him
as
wonderful
as
his
picture
was
to
her
sara
lee
was
in
the
parlor
waiting
for
him
the
one
electric
lamp
was
lighted
so
that
the
phonograph
in
one
corner
became
only
a
bit
of
reflected
light
there
was
a
gas
fire
going
and
in
front
of
it
was
a
white
fur
rug
in
aunt
harriet
circle
there
were
few
orientals
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
not
yet
entirely
paid
for
stood
against
the
wall
and
a
leather
chair
hollowed
by
uncle
james
solid
body
was
by
the
fire
it
was
just
such
a
tidy
rather
vulgar
and
homelike
room
as
no
doubt
harvey
would
picture
for
his
own
home
he
had
of
course
never
seen
the
white
simplicity
of
sara
lee
bedroom
sara
lee
in
a
black
dress
admitted
him
when
he
had
taken
off
his
ulster
and
his
overshoes
he
had
been
raised
by
women
and
came
in
she
was
standing
by
the
fire
raining
he
said
it
getting
colder
may
be
snow
before
morning
then
he
stopped
sometimes
the
wonder
of
sara
lee
got
him
in
the
throat
she
had
so
much
the
look
of
being
poised
for
flight
even
in
her
quietest
moments
there
was
that
about
her
a
sort
of
repressed
eagerness
a
look
of
seeing
things
far
away
aunt
harriet
said
that
there
were
times
when
she
had
a
flighty
look
and
that
night
it
was
that
impression
of
elusiveness
that
stopped
harvey
amiable
prattle
about
the
weather
and
took
him
to
her
with
his
arms
out
sara
lee
he
said
do
look
like
that
like
what
said
sara
lee
prosaically
i
do
know
he
muttered
you
sometimes
you
look
as
though
then
he
put
his
arms
round
her
i
love
you
he
said
i
be
good
to
you
sara
lee
if
you
have
me
he
bent
down
and
put
his
cheek
against
hers
if
you
only
marry
me
dear
a
woman
has
a
way
of
thinking
most
clearly
and
lucidly
when
the
man
has
stopped
thinking
with
his
arms
about
her
harvey
could
only
feel
he
was
trembling
as
for
sara
lee
instantly
two
pictures
flashed
through
her
mind
each
distinct
each
clear
almost
photographic
one
was
of
anna
in
her
tiny
house
down
the
street
dragged
with
a
nursing
baby
the
other
was
that
one
from
a
magazine
of
a
boy
dying
on
a
battlefield
and
crying
mother
two
sorts
of
maternity
one
quiet
peaceful
not
always
beautiful
but
the
thing
by
which
and
to
which
she
had
been
reared
the
other
vicarious
of
all
the
world
do
you
love
me
that
way
he
said
his
cheek
still
against
hers
i
do
know
you
do
know
it
was
then
that
he
straightened
away
from
her
and
looked
without
seeing
at
the
blur
of
light
which
was
the
phonograph
sara
lee
glancing
up
saw
him
then
as
he
was
in
the
photograph
face
set
and
head
thrust
forward
and
that
drive
of
jaw
and
backward
flow
of
heavy
hair
that
marked
him
all
man
and
virile
man
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
i
do
love
you
harvey
she
said
and
went
into
his
arms
with
the
complete
surrender
of
a
child
he
was
outrageously
happy
he
sat
on
the
arm
of
uncle
james
chair
where
she
was
almost
swallowed
up
and
with
his
face
against
hers
he
made
his
simple
plans
now
and
then
he
kissed
the
little
hollow
under
her
ear
and
because
he
knew
nothing
of
the
abandon
of
a
woman
in
a
great
passion
he
missed
nothing
in
her
attitude
into
her
silence
and
passivity
he
read
the
reflection
of
his
own
adoring
love
and
thought
it
hers
to
be
fair
to
sara
lee
she
imagined
that
her
content
in
devotion
was
something
more
as
much
more
as
was
necessary
for
in
sara
lee
experience
marriage
was
a
thing
compounded
of
affection
habit
small
differences
and
a
home
of
passion
that
passion
which
later
she
was
to
meet
and
suffer
from
the
terrible
love
that
hurts
and
agonizes
she
had
never
even
dreamed
great
days
were
before
sara
lee
she
sat
by
the
fire
and
knitted
and
behind
the
back
drop
on
the
great
stage
of
the
world
was
preparing
unsuspected
the
en
ii
about
the
middle
of
january
mabel
andrews
wrote
to
sara
lee
from
france
where
she
was
already
installed
in
a
hospital
at
calais
the
evening
before
the
letter
came
harvey
had
brought
round
the
engagement
ring
he
had
made
a
little
money
in
war
stocks
and
into
the
ring
he
had
put
every
dollar
of
his
profits
and
a
great
love
and
gentleness
and
hopes
which
he
did
not
formulate
even
to
himself
it
was
a
solitaire
diamond
conventionally
set
and
larger
far
larger
than
the
modest
little
stone
on
which
harvey
had
been
casting
anxious
glances
for
months
do
you
like
it
honey
he
asked
anxiously
sara
lee
looked
at
it
on
her
finger
it
is
lovely
it
it
terrible
said
poor
sara
lee
and
cried
on
his
shoulder
harvey
was
not
subtle
he
had
never
even
heard
of
mabel
andrews
and
he
had
a
tendency
to
restrict
his
war
reading
to
the
quarter
column
in
the
morning
paper
entitled
salient
points
of
the
day
war
news
what
could
he
know
for
instance
of
wounded
men
who
were
hungry
which
is
what
mabel
wrote
about
you
said
you
could
cook
she
had
written
well
we
need
cooks
and
something
to
cook
sometime
they
have
it
all
fixed
no
doubt
but
just
now
it
awful
sara
lee
the
british
have
money
and
food
plenty
of
it
but
here
yesterday
i
cut
the
clothes
off
a
wounded
belgian
boy
he
had
been
hours
on
a
railway
siding
without
even
soup
or
coffee
it
was
early
in
the
war
then
and
between
ypres
and
the
sea
stretched
a
long
thin
line
of
belgian
trenches
a
frantic
belgian
government
thrust
out
of
its
own
land
was
facing
the
problem
with
scant
funds
and
with
no
of
any
sort
for
feeding
that
desolate
little
army
france
had
her
own
problems
her
army
industrially
and
the
great
and
constantly
growing
british
forces
quartered
there
paying
for
what
they
got
but
requiring
much
the
world
knows
now
of
the
starvation
of
belgium
what
it
does
not
know
and
may
never
know
is
of
the
struggle
during
those
early
days
to
feed
the
heroic
belgian
army
in
their
wet
and
almost
untenable
trenches
hospital
trains
they
could
improvise
out
of
what
rolling
stock
remained
to
them
money
could
be
borrowed
and
was
but
food
clothing
ammunition
in
his
little
villa
on
the
seacoast
the
belgian
king
knew
that
his
soldiers
were
hungry
and
paced
the
floor
of
his
tiny
and
over
in
an
american
city
whose
skyline
was
as
pointed
with
furnace
turrets
as
constantinople
is
with
mosques
over
there
sara
lee
heard
that
call
of
hunger
and
put
on
her
engagement
ring
later
on
that
evening
with
harvey
wide
cheerful
face
turned
adoringly
to
her
sara
lee
formulated
a
question
do
you
sometimes
feel
as
though
you
like
to
go
to
france
and
fight
what
for
well
they
need
men
do
they
i
guess
they
do
need
me
honey
i
be
the
dickens
of
a
lot
of
use
never
fired
a
gun
in
my
life
you
could
learn
it
is
hard
harvey
sat
upright
and
stared
at
her
oh
if
you
want
me
to
go
he
said
and
waited
sara
lee
twisted
her
ring
on
her
finger
nobody
wants
anybody
to
go
she
said
not
very
elegantly
just
i
rather
like
to
think
you
wanted
to
go
that
was
almost
too
subtle
for
harvey
something
about
him
was
rather
reminiscent
of
uncle
james
on
mornings
when
he
was
determined
not
to
go
to
church
it
not
our
fight
he
said
and
as
far
as
that
goes
i
not
so
sure
there
is
right
on
both
sides
or
wrong
most
likely
wrong
i
look
fine
going
over
there
to
help
the
allies
and
then
making
up
my
mind
it
was
the
british
who
spilled
the
beans
now
let
talk
about
something
interesting
for
instance
how
much
we
love
each
other
it
was
always
we
with
harvey
in
his
simple
creed
if
a
girl
accepted
a
man
and
let
him
kiss
her
and
wore
his
ring
it
was
a
reciprocal
love
affair
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
sometimes
as
the
evening
dragged
toward
a
close
sara
lee
was
just
a
bit
weary
of
his
arms
and
that
she
sought
after
he
had
gone
the
haven
of
her
little
white
room
and
closed
the
door
and
had
to
look
rather
a
long
time
at
his
photograph
before
she
was
in
a
properly
loving
mood
again
but
that
night
after
his
prolonged
sara
lee
went
upstairs
to
her
room
and
faced
the
situation
she
was
going
to
marry
harvey
she
was
committed
to
that
and
she
loved
him
not
as
he
cared
perhaps
but
he
was
a
very
definite
part
of
her
life
once
or
twice
when
he
had
been
detained
by
business
she
had
missed
him
had
put
in
a
lonely
and
most
unhappy
evening
sara
lee
had
known
comparatively
few
men
in
that
small
and
simple
circle
of
hers
with
its
tennis
court
in
a
vacant
lot
its
one
or
two
inexpensive
cars
its
picnics
and
porch
parties
there
was
none
of
the
usual
give
and
take
of
more
sophisticated
circles
boys
and
girls
paired
off
rather
early
and
remained
paired
by
tacit
agreement
there
was
comparatively
little
shifting
there
were
few
free
lances
among
the
men
and
none
among
the
girls
when
she
was
seventeen
harvey
had
made
it
known
unmistakably
that
sara
lee
was
his
and
no
trespassing
and
for
two
years
he
had
without
intentional
selfishness
kept
sara
lee
for
himself
that
was
how
matters
stood
that
january
night
when
sara
lee
went
upstairs
after
harvey
had
gone
and
read
mabel
letter
with
photograph
turned
to
the
wall
under
her
calm
exterior
a
little
flame
of
rebellion
was
burning
in
her
harvey
perpetual
we
his
attitude
toward
the
war
and
mabel
letter
with
what
it
opened
before
her
had
set
the
match
to
something
in
sara
lee
she
did
not
recognize
a
strain
of
the
adventurer
a
to
some
wandering
ancestor
perhaps
but
more
than
anything
it
had
set
fire
to
the
something
maternal
that
is
in
all
good
women
yet
had
aunt
harriet
not
come
in
just
then
the
flame
might
have
died
and
had
it
died
a
certain
small
page
of
the
history
of
this
war
would
never
have
been
written
aunt
harriet
came
in
hesitatingly
she
wore
a
black
wrapper
and
her
face
with
her
hair
drawn
back
for
the
night
looked
tight
and
old
harvey
gone
she
asked
yes
i
thought
i
better
come
in
there
something
i
can
tell
you
in
the
morning
if
you
tired
i
not
tired
said
sara
lee
aunt
harriet
sat
down
miserably
on
a
chair
i
had
a
letter
from
jennie
she
stated
the
girl
gone
and
the
children
have
whooping
cough
she
like
me
to
come
right
away
to
do
the
maid
work
said
sara
lee
indignantly
you
must
do
it
that
all
she
can
get
somebody
but
aunt
harriet
was
firm
she
was
not
a
friend
and
since
jennie
was
good
enough
to
offer
her
a
home
she
felt
she
ought
to
go
at
once
you
have
to
get
married
right
away
she
finished
goodness
knows
it
time
enough
for
two
years
harvey
has
been
barking
like
a
watchdog
in
front
of
the
house
and
keeping
every
other
young
man
away
sara
lee
smiled
he
only
been
lying
on
the
doormat
aunt
harriet
she
observed
i
do
believe
he
knows
how
to
bark
oh
he
mild
enough
he
may
change
after
marriage
some
do
but
she
added
hastily
he
be
a
good
husband
he
that
sort
suddenly
something
that
had
been
taking
shape
in
sara
lee
small
head
quite
unknown
to
her
developed
identity
and
speech
but
i
not
going
to
marry
him
just
yet
she
said
aunt
harriet
eyes
fell
on
the
photograph
with
its
face
to
the
wall
and
she
started
you
have
quarreled
with
him
have
you
no
of
course
not
i
have
something
else
i
want
to
do
first
all
aunt
harriet
i
want
to
go
to
france
aunt
harriet
began
to
tremble
and
sara
lee
went
over
and
put
her
young
arms
about
her
do
look
like
that
she
said
it
only
for
a
little
while
got
to
go
i
just
have
to
that
all
go
how
demanded
aunt
harriet
i
do
know
i
find
some
way
i
had
a
letter
from
mabel
things
are
awful
over
there
and
how
will
you
help
them
her
face
worked
nervously
is
it
going
to
help
for
you
to
be
shot
or
carried
off
by
the
germans
the
atrocity
stories
were
all
that
aunt
harriet
knew
of
the
war
and
all
she
could
think
of
now
you
come
back
with
your
hands
cut
off
sara
lee
straightened
and
looked
out
where
between
the
white
curtains
the
spire
of
the
methodist
church
marked
the
east
i
going
she
said
and
she
stood
there
already
poised
for
flight
there
was
no
sleep
in
the
little
house
that
night
sara
lee
could
hear
the
older
woman
moving
about
in
her
lonely
bed
where
the
spring
still
sagged
from
uncle
james
heavy
form
and
at
last
she
went
in
and
crept
in
beside
her
toward
morning
aunt
harriet
slept
with
the
girl
arm
across
her
and
then
sara
lee
went
back
to
her
room
and
tried
to
plan
she
had
a
little
money
and
she
had
heard
that
living
was
cheap
abroad
she
could
get
across
then
and
perhaps
keep
herself
but
she
must
do
more
than
that
to
justify
her
going
she
must
get
money
and
then
decide
how
the
money
was
to
be
spent
if
she
could
only
talk
it
over
with
uncle
james
or
with
harvey
harvey
knew
about
business
and
money
but
she
dared
not
go
to
harvey
she
was
terribly
frightened
when
she
even
thought
of
him
there
was
no
hope
of
making
him
understand
and
no
chance
of
reasoning
with
him
because
to
be
frank
she
had
no
reasons
she
had
only
instinct
instinct
and
a
great
tenderness
toward
suffering
no
obviously
harvey
must
not
know
until
everything
was
arranged
that
morning
the
methodist
church
packed
a
barrel
for
the
belgians
there
was
a
real
rite
of
placing
in
it
augustus
gregory
old
sealskin
coat
now
a
light
brown
and
badly
worn
but
for
years
the
only
one
in
the
neighborhood
various
familiar
articles
appeared
to
be
thrust
into
darkness
only
to
emerge
in
surroundings
never
dreamed
of
in
their
better
days
the
little
howard
boy
first
trouser
suit
the
clothing
of
a
baby
that
had
never
lived
big
joe
hemmingway
dress
suit
the
one
he
was
married
in
and
now
too
small
for
him
and
here
and
there
things
that
could
ill
be
spared
brought
in
and
offered
with
resolute
cheerfulness
sara
lee
brought
some
of
uncle
james
things
and
was
at
once
set
to
work
the
women
there
called
sara
lee
capable
but
it
was
to
take
other
surroundings
to
bring
out
her
real
efficiency
and
it
was
when
bending
over
a
barrel
while
round
her
went
on
that
pitying
talk
of
women
about
a
great
calamity
that
sara
lee
got
her
great
idea
and
later
on
she
made
the
only
speech
of
her
life
that
evening
harvey
went
home
in
a
quiet
glow
of
happiness
he
had
had
a
good
day
and
he
had
heard
of
a
little
house
that
would
exactly
suit
sara
lee
and
him
he
did
not
notice
his
sister
silence
when
he
spoke
about
it
he
was
absorbed
manlike
in
his
plans
the
leete
house
he
said
in
answer
to
her
perfunctory
question
will
leete
has
lost
his
mind
and
volunteered
for
the
ambulance
service
in
france
leete
is
going
to
her
mother
maybe
he
feels
it
his
duty
he
can
drive
a
car
and
they
have
no
children
duty
nothing
he
seemed
almost
unduly
irritated
he
tired
of
the
commission
business
that
all
to
have
heard
the
fellows
in
the
office
anyhow
they
want
to
the
house
and
i
going
to
take
sara
lee
there
his
sister
looked
at
him
and
there
was
in
her
face
something
of
the
expression
of
the
women
that
day
as
they
packed
the
barrel
but
she
said
nothing
until
he
was
leaving
the
house
that
night
then
she
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
she
was
a
weary
little
woman
older
than
harvey
and
tired
with
many
children
she
had
been
gathering
up
small
overshoes
in
the
hall
and
he
had
stopped
to
help
her
you
know
harvey
sara
lee
not
i
always
think
she
different
somehow
well
i
guess
yes
there
nobody
like
her
you
ca
bully
her
you
know
harvey
stared
at
her
with
honestly
perplexed
eyes
bully
he
said
what
on
earth
makes
you
say
that
then
he
laughed
do
you
worry
belle
he
said
i
know
i
a
fierce
and
domineering
person
but
if
there
any
bullying
i
know
who
do
it
she
not
like
the
other
girls
you
know
she
reiterated
rather
helplessly
sure
she
not
but
she
enough
like
them
to
need
a
house
to
live
in
and
if
she
is
crazy
about
the
leete
place
i
eat
it
he
banged
out
cheerfully
whistling
as
he
went
down
the
street
he
stopped
whistling
however
at
sara
lee
door
the
neighborhood
preserved
certain
traditions
as
to
a
house
of
mourning
it
lowered
its
voice
in
passing
and
made
its
calls
of
condolence
in
dark
clothes
and
a
general
air
of
gloom
pianos
near
by
were
played
only
with
the
windows
closed
and
even
the
milkman
leaving
his
bottles
walked
on
tiptoe
and
presented
his
monthly
bill
solemnly
so
harvey
stopped
whistling
rang
the
bell
apologetically
and
faced
a
new
and
vivid
sara
lee
flushed
and
with
shining
eyes
but
woefully
frightened
she
told
him
almost
at
once
he
had
only
reached
the
dining
room
of
the
leete
house
which
he
was
explaining
had
a
white
wainscoting
when
she
interrupted
him
the
ladies
of
the
methodist
church
were
going
to
collect
a
certain
amount
each
month
to
support
a
soup
kitchen
as
near
the
front
as
possible
good
work
said
harvey
heartily
i
suppose
they
do
get
hungry
poor
devils
now
about
the
dining
room
harvey
dear
sara
lee
broke
in
i
not
finished
i
i
going
over
to
run
it
you
are
not
but
i
am
it
all
arranged
it
my
plan
they
all
wanted
to
do
something
besides
giving
clothes
they
send
barrels
and
they
never
hear
from
them
again
and
it
hard
to
keep
interested
but
with
me
there
writing
home
and
telling
them
we
served
soup
to
this
man
and
that
man
perhaps
wounded
and
and
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
see
how
interested
every
one
will
be
gregory
has
promised
dollars
a
month
and
you
not
going
said
harvey
in
a
flat
tone
that
all
talk
to
me
about
it
sara
lee
flushed
deeper
and
started
again
but
rather
hopelessly
there
was
no
converting
a
man
who
would
not
argue
or
reason
who
based
everything
on
flat
refusal
but
somebody
must
go
she
said
with
a
tightening
of
her
voice
here
mabel
andrews
letter
read
it
and
you
will
understand
i
do
want
to
read
it
nevertheless
he
took
it
and
read
it
he
read
slowly
he
did
nothing
quickly
except
assert
his
masculine
domination
he
had
all
the
faults
of
his
virtues
he
was
as
slow
as
he
was
sure
as
unimaginative
as
he
was
faithful
he
read
it
and
gave
it
back
to
her
i
do
think
you
mean
it
he
said
i
give
you
credit
for
too
much
sense
maybe
some
one
is
needed
over
there
i
guess
things
are
pretty
bad
but
why
should
you
make
it
your
affair
there
are
about
a
million
women
in
this
country
that
have
got
anything
else
to
do
let
them
go
some
of
them
will
but
they
afraid
mostly
afraid
my
god
i
should
think
they
would
be
afraid
and
you
asking
me
to
let
you
go
into
danger
to
put
off
our
wedding
while
you
wander
about
over
there
with
a
million
men
and
no
women
and
you
wrong
harvey
dear
said
sara
lee
in
a
low
voice
i
am
not
asking
you
at
all
i
am
telling
you
that
i
am
going
sara
lee
leaving
made
an
enormous
stir
in
her
small
community
opinion
was
divided
she
was
right
according
to
some
she
was
mad
according
to
others
the
women
of
the
methodist
church
finding
a
real
field
of
activity
stood
behind
her
solidly
guaranties
of
funds
came
in
in
a
steady
flow
though
the
amounts
were
small
and
on
the
word
going
about
that
she
was
to
start
a
soup
kitchen
for
the
wounded
housewives
sent
in
directions
for
making
their
most
cherished
soups
sara
lee
going
to
a
land
where
the
meat
was
mostly
horse
and
where
vegetables
were
scarce
and
limited
to
potatoes
brussels
sprouts
and
cabbage
found
herself
the
possessor
of
recipes
for
making
such
dainties
as
mushroom
soup
cream
of
asparagus
clam
broth
with
whipped
cream
and
from
gregory
the
wealthy
woman
of
the
church
green
turtle
and
consomme
she
was
very
busy
and
rather
sad
she
was
helping
aunt
harriet
to
close
the
house
and
getting
her
small
wardrobe
in
order
and
once
a
day
she
went
to
a
school
of
languages
and
painfully
learned
from
a
fierce
and
kindly
old
frenchman
a
list
of
french
nouns
and
prefixes
like
this
livre
le
crayon
la
plume
la
and
so
on
by
the
end
of
ten
days
she
could
say
rose
bon
considering
that
harvey
came
every
night
and
ran
the
gamut
of
the
emotions
from
pleading
and
expostulation
at
eight
to
black
fury
at
ten
when
he
banged
out
of
the
house
sara
lee
was
amazingly
calm
if
she
had
moments
of
weakness
when
the
call
from
overseas
was
less
insistent
than
the
call
for
peace
and
protection
if
the
nightly
drawn
picture
of
the
leete
house
with
tile
mantels
and
a
white
bathroom
sometimes
obtruded
itself
as
against
her
approaching
homelessness
sara
lee
made
no
sign
she
had
her
photograph
taken
for
her
passport
and
when
harvey
refused
one
she
sent
it
to
him
by
mail
with
the
word
please
in
the
corner
harvey
groaned
over
it
and
got
it
out
at
night
and
scolded
it
wildly
and
then
slept
with
it
under
his
pillows
when
he
slept
at
all
not
sara
lee
and
certainly
not
harvey
knew
what
was
calling
her
and
even
later
when
waves
of
homesickness
racked
her
with
wild
remorse
she
knew
that
she
had
had
to
go
and
that
she
could
not
return
until
she
had
done
the
thing
for
which
she
had
been
sent
whatever
that
might
be
iii
the
first
thing
that
struck
sara
lee
was
the
way
she
was
saying
her
nightly
prayers
in
all
sorts
of
odd
places
in
trains
and
in
hotels
and
after
sufficient
interval
in
the
steamer
she
prayed
under
these
novel
circumstances
to
be
made
a
better
girl
and
to
do
a
lot
of
good
over
there
and
to
be
forgiven
for
hurting
harvey
she
did
this
every
night
and
then
got
into
her
narrow
bed
and
studied
french
nouns
because
she
had
decided
that
there
was
no
time
for
verbs
and
numbers
which
put
her
to
sleep
un
deux
trois
quatre
cinq
sara
lee
would
begin
and
go
on
rocking
gently
in
her
berth
as
the
steamer
rolled
vingt
trente
her
voice
would
die
away
the
book
on
the
floor
and
harvey
picture
on
the
tiny
table
sara
lee
would
sleep
and
as
the
ship
trembled
the
light
over
her
head
would
shine
on
harvey
ring
and
it
glistened
like
a
tear
one
thing
surprised
her
as
she
gradually
met
some
of
her
fellow
passengers
she
was
not
alone
on
her
errand
others
there
were
on
board
young
and
old
women
and
men
too
who
had
felt
the
call
of
mercy
and
were
going
as
ignorant
as
she
to
help
as
ignorant
but
not
so
friendless
most
of
them
were
accredited
somewhere
they
had
definite
objectives
but
what
was
more
alarming
they
talked
in
big
figures
great
organizations
were
behind
them
she
heard
of
the
rehabilitation
of
belgium
and
portable
hospitals
and
millions
of
dollars
and
red
cross
trains
not
once
did
sara
lee
hear
of
anything
so
humble
as
a
soup
kitchen
the
war
was
a
vast
thing
they
would
observe
it
could
only
be
touched
by
great
organizations
individual
effort
was
negligible
once
she
took
her
courage
in
her
hands
but
i
should
think
she
said
that
even
great
organizations
depend
on
the
on
individual
efforts
the
portable
hospital
woman
turned
to
her
patronizingly
certainly
my
dear
she
said
but
coördinated
coördinated
it
is
hard
to
say
just
when
the
lights
went
down
on
sara
lee
quiet
stage
and
the
interlude
began
not
on
the
steamer
for
after
three
days
of
discouragement
and
good
weather
they
struck
a
storm
and
sara
fine
frenzy
died
for
a
time
of
nausea
she
did
not
appear
again
until
the
boat
entered
the
mersey
a
pale
and
shaken
angel
of
mercy
not
at
all
sure
of
her
wings
and
most
terribly
homesick
that
night
sara
lee
made
a
friend
one
that
harvey
would
have
approved
of
an
elderly
englishman
named
travers
he
was
standing
by
the
rail
in
the
rain
looking
out
at
the
blinking
signal
lights
on
both
sides
of
the
river
the
ship
for
the
first
time
had
abandoned
its
policy
of
darkness
and
the
decks
were
bathed
in
light
overhead
the
yardarm
blinkers
were
signaling
and
directly
over
sara
lee
head
a
great
white
searchlight
swept
the
water
ahead
the
wind
was
blowing
a
gale
and
the
red
and
green
lights
of
the
pilot
boat
swung
in
great
arcs
that
seemed
to
touch
the
waves
on
either
side
sara
lee
stood
beside
travers
for
companionship
only
he
had
preserved
a
typically
british
aloofness
during
the
voyage
and
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
but
there
was
something
forlorn
in
sara
lee
that
night
as
she
clutched
her
hat
with
both
hands
and
stared
out
at
the
shore
lights
and
if
he
had
been
silent
during
the
voyage
he
had
not
been
deaf
so
he
knew
why
almost
every
woman
on
the
ship
was
making
the
voyage
but
he
knew
nothing
about
sara
lee
bad
night
said
travers
i
was
wondering
what
they
are
trying
to
do
with
that
little
boat
travers
concealed
the
surprise
of
a
man
who
was
making
his
voyage
that
the
pilot
boat
he
explained
we
are
picking
up
a
pilot
but
marveled
sara
lee
rather
breathlessly
have
we
come
all
the
way
without
any
pilot
he
explained
that
to
her
and
showed
her
a
few
moments
later
how
the
pilot
came
with
incredible
rapidity
up
the
swaying
rope
ladder
and
over
the
side
to
be
honest
he
had
been
watching
for
the
pilot
boat
not
to
see
what
to
sara
lee
was
the
thrilling
progress
of
the
pilot
up
the
ladder
but
to
get
the
newspapers
he
would
bring
on
with
him
it
is
perhaps
explanatory
of
the
way
things
went
for
sara
lee
from
that
time
on
that
he
quite
forgot
his
newspapers
the
chairs
were
gone
from
the
decks
preparatory
to
the
morning
landing
so
they
walked
about
and
sara
lee
at
last
told
him
her
story
the
ladies
of
the
methodist
church
and
the
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
she
was
to
have
outside
of
her
traveling
expenses
to
found
and
keep
going
a
soup
kitchen
behind
the
lines
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
he
said
that
twenty
pounds
humph
good
god
but
this
last
was
under
his
breath
then
she
told
him
of
mabel
andrews
letter
and
at
last
read
it
to
him
he
listened
attentively
of
course
she
said
when
she
had
put
the
letter
back
into
her
bag
i
ca
feed
a
lot
even
with
soup
but
if
i
only
help
a
few
it
worth
doing
is
it
very
much
worth
doing
he
said
gravely
i
suppose
you
are
not
by
any
chance
going
to
write
a
weekly
article
for
one
of
your
newspapers
about
what
you
are
doing
i
had
thought
of
it
do
you
think
i
should
quite
unexpectedly
travers
patted
her
shoulder
my
dear
child
he
said
now
and
then
i
find
somebody
who
helps
to
revive
my
faith
in
human
nature
thank
you
sara
lee
did
not
understand
the
touch
on
the
shoulder
had
made
her
think
suddenly
of
uncle
james
and
her
chin
quivered
i
just
a
little
frightened
she
said
in
a
small
voice
twenty
pounds
repeated
travers
to
himself
twenty
pounds
and
aloud
of
course
you
speak
french
very
little
i
had
six
lessons
and
i
can
count
some
the
sense
of
unreality
which
the
twenty
pounds
had
roused
in
cautious
british
mind
grew
no
money
no
french
no
objective
just
a
great
human
desire
to
be
useful
in
her
own
small
way
this
was
a
new
type
to
him
what
a
sporting
chance
this
frail
bit
of
a
girl
was
taking
and
he
noticed
now
something
that
had
escaped
him
before
a
dauntlessness
a
courage
of
the
spirit
rather
than
of
the
body
that
was
in
the
very
poise
of
her
head
i
not
afraid
about
the
language
she
was
saying
i
have
a
phrase
book
and
a
hungry
man
maybe
sick
or
wounded
can
understand
a
bowl
of
soup
in
any
language
i
should
think
and
i
can
cook
it
was
a
perplexed
and
thoughtful
travers
who
sipped
his
in
the
smoking
room
before
retiring
he
took
the
problem
to
bed
with
him
and
woke
up
in
the
night
saying
twenty
pounds
good
god
in
the
morning
they
left
the
ship
he
found
sara
lee
among
the
k
waiting
to
have
her
passport
examined
and
asked
her
where
she
was
stopping
in
london
she
had
read
somewhere
of
claridge
in
a
novel
probably
i
should
advise
claridge
he
said
reflecting
rather
grimly
on
the
charges
of
that
very
exclusive
hotel
suppose
you
let
me
make
a
suggestion
so
he
wrote
out
the
name
of
a
fine
old
english
house
on
trafalgar
square
where
she
could
stay
until
she
went
to
france
there
would
be
the
matter
of
a
passport
to
cross
the
channel
it
might
take
a
day
or
two
perhaps
he
could
help
her
he
would
give
himself
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
her
very
soon
sara
lee
got
on
the
train
and
rode
up
to
london
she
said
to
herself
over
and
over
this
is
england
i
am
really
in
england
but
it
did
not
remove
the
sense
of
unreality
even
the
english
grass
bright
green
in
midwinter
only
added
to
the
sense
of
unreality
she
tried
sitting
in
the
strange
train
with
its
small
compartments
to
think
of
harvey
she
looked
at
her
ring
and
tried
to
recall
some
of
the
tender
things
he
had
said
to
her
but
harvey
eluded
her
she
could
not
hear
his
voice
and
when
she
tried
to
see
him
it
was
harvey
of
the
wide
face
and
the
angry
eyes
of
the
last
days
that
she
saw
morley
comforted
her
the
man
at
the
door
had
been
there
for
forty
years
and
was
beyond
surprise
he
had
her
story
in
hours
and
in
he
was
her
slave
the
elderly
chambermaid
mothered
her
and
failed
to
report
that
sara
lee
was
doing
a
small
washing
in
her
room
and
had
pasted
handkerchiefs
over
the
ancient
walnut
of
her
wardrobe
going
over
are
you
she
said
dear
me
what
courage
you
got
miss
they
tell
me
things
is
horrible
over
there
that
why
i
going
replied
sara
lee
and
insisted
on
helping
to
make
up
the
bed
it
easier
when
two
do
it
she
said
casually
travers
put
in
a
fretful
hours
before
he
came
to
see
her
he
lunched
at
brooks
and
astounded
an
elderly
member
of
the
house
by
putting
her
problem
to
him
a
young
girl
exclaimed
the
why
deuce
take
it
it
no
place
for
a
young
girl
an
american
explained
travers
uncomfortably
she
perfectly
able
to
look
after
herself
probably
a
correspondent
in
disguise
they
go
to
any
lengths
she
not
a
correspondent
let
her
stay
in
boulogne
there
work
there
in
the
hospitals
she
not
a
nurse
she
a
well
she
a
cook
or
so
she
says
the
stared
at
travers
and
travers
stared
back
defiantly
what
in
the
name
of
god
is
she
going
to
cook
soup
said
travers
in
a
voice
of
suppressed
irritation
got
a
little
money
and
she
wants
to
establish
a
soup
kitchen
behind
the
belgian
trenches
on
a
line
of
communication
i
suppose
he
continued
angrily
even
you
will
admit
that
the
belgian
army
needs
all
the
soup
it
can
get
i
do
approve
of
women
near
the
lines
neither
do
i
but
i
exceedingly
glad
that
a
few
of
them
have
the
courage
to
go
there
what
she
going
to
make
soup
out
of
i
not
a
cooking
expert
but
i
know
her
and
i
fancy
she
manage
it
ended
by
the
agreeing
to
use
his
influence
with
the
war
office
to
get
sara
lee
to
france
he
was
very
unwilling
the
spy
question
was
looming
large
those
days
even
the
red
cross
had
unwittingly
spread
its
protection
over
more
than
one
german
agent
the
lines
were
being
drawn
in
i
may
possibly
get
her
to
france
i
do
know
of
course
he
said
in
that
ungracious
tone
in
which
an
englishman
often
grants
a
favor
which
he
will
go
to
any
amount
of
trouble
to
do
after
that
it
up
to
her
travers
reflected
rather
grimly
that
after
that
it
was
apparently
up
to
him
sara
lee
sat
in
her
room
at
morley
hotel
and
looked
out
at
the
life
of
london
policemen
with
chin
straps
schoolboys
in
high
silk
hats
and
eton
suits
the
hats
generally
in
disreputable
condition
clerks
dressed
as
men
at
home
dressed
for
easter
sunday
church
and
men
in
uniforms
only
a
fair
sprinkling
of
these
last
in
those
early
days
on
the
first
afternoon
there
was
a
military
funeral
a
regiment
of
scots
in
kilts
came
swinging
down
from
the
church
of
martin
in
the
fields
tall
and
wonderful
men
grave
and
very
sad
behind
them
on
a
gun
carriage
was
the
body
of
their
officer
with
the
british
flag
over
the
casket
and
his
sword
and
cap
on
the
top
sara
lee
cried
bitterly
it
was
not
until
they
had
gone
that
she
remembered
that
harvey
had
always
called
the
scots
men
in
petticoats
she
felt
a
thrill
of
shame
for
him
and
no
amount
of
looking
at
his
picture
seemed
to
help
travers
called
the
second
afternoon
and
was
received
by
august
at
the
door
as
an
old
friend
she
waiting
in
there
he
said
very
nice
young
lady
sir
very
kind
to
everybody
travers
found
her
by
a
window
looking
out
there
was
a
recruiting
meeting
going
on
in
trafalgar
square
the
speakers
standing
on
the
monument
now
and
then
there
was
a
cheer
and
some
young
fellow
sheepishly
offered
himself
sara
lee
was
having
a
mad
desire
to
go
over
and
offer
herself
too
because
she
reflected
she
had
been
in
london
almost
two
days
and
she
was
as
far
from
france
as
ever
not
knowing
of
course
that
three
months
was
a
fair
time
for
the
slow
methods
then
in
vogue
there
was
a
young
man
in
the
room
but
sara
lee
had
not
noticed
him
he
was
a
tall
very
blond
young
man
in
a
belgian
uniform
with
a
quaint
cap
which
allowed
a
gilt
tassel
to
drop
over
his
forehead
he
sat
on
a
sofa
curling
up
the
ends
of
a
very
small
mustache
his
legs
in
cavalry
boots
crossed
and
extending
a
surprising
distance
beyond
the
sofa
the
lights
were
up
now
beyond
the
back
drop
the
stage
darkened
a
new
scene
with
a
vengeance
a
scene
laid
in
strange
surroundings
with
men
whole
men
and
wounded
men
and
spying
men
and
sara
lee
and
this
young
belgian
whose
name
was
henri
and
whose
other
name
because
of
what
he
suffered
and
what
he
did
we
may
not
know
iv
henri
sat
on
his
sofa
and
watched
sara
lee
also
he
shamelessly
listened
to
the
conversation
not
because
he
meant
to
be
an
eavesdropper
but
because
he
liked
sara
lee
voice
he
had
expected
a
highly
inflected
british
voice
and
instead
here
was
something
entirely
different
that
is
sara
lee
endeavor
to
reconcile
the
english
a
with
her
normal
western
pennsylvania
pronunciation
she
did
it
quite
unintentionally
but
she
had
a
good
ear
and
it
was
difficult
for
instance
to
say
rather
when
travers
said
rawther
henri
had
a
good
ear
too
and
the
man
he
was
waiting
for
did
not
come
also
he
had
been
to
school
in
england
and
spoke
english
rather
better
than
most
british
so
he
heard
a
conversation
like
this
the
gaps
being
what
he
lost
travers
to
france
anyhow
after
that
sara
lee
awfully
sorry
to
be
but
what
shall
i
do
if
i
do
get
over
the
chambermaid
very
difficult
travers
the
proper
and
sensible
thing
is
home
sara
lee
to
america
but
i
have
done
anything
yet
henri
knew
that
she
was
an
american
he
also
realized
that
she
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
he
glared
at
poor
travers
who
was
doing
his
best
and
lighted
a
french
cigarette
there
must
be
some
way
said
sara
lee
if
they
need
help
and
i
have
read
you
mabel
andrews
letter
then
i
should
think
they
be
glad
to
send
me
they
would
be
of
course
he
said
but
the
fact
is
there
been
some
trouble
about
spies
and
henri
eyes
narrowed
spies
and
they
think
i
a
spy
my
dear
child
remonstrated
travers
slightly
exasperated
they
not
thinking
about
you
at
all
the
war
office
has
never
heard
of
you
it
a
general
rule
sara
lee
was
not
placated
let
them
cable
home
and
find
out
about
me
i
can
give
them
references
why
all
sorts
of
prominent
people
are
sending
me
money
they
must
trust
me
or
they
would
there
were
no
gaps
for
henri
now
sara
lee
did
not
care
who
heard
her
and
even
travers
had
slightly
raised
his
voice
henri
was
divided
between
a
conviction
that
he
ought
to
go
away
and
a
mad
desire
to
join
in
the
conversation
greatly
augmented
when
sara
lee
went
to
the
window
and
wiped
her
eyes
if
you
only
spoke
french
began
travers
sara
lee
looked
over
her
shoulder
but
of
course
i
do
she
said
and
german
and
and
yiddish
and
all
sorts
of
languages
every
spy
does
henri
smiled
appreciatively
it
might
all
have
ended
there
very
easily
sara
lee
might
have
fought
the
war
office
and
won
out
but
it
is
extremely
unlikely
the
chances
at
that
moment
were
that
she
would
spend
endless
days
and
hours
in
anterooms
and
tell
her
story
and
make
her
plea
a
hundred
times
and
then
go
back
home
to
harvey
and
the
leete
house
and
after
a
time
like
gregory
speak
rather
too
often
of
the
time
i
went
abroad
but
sara
lee
was
to
go
to
france
and
even
further
to
the
fragment
of
unconquered
belgium
that
remained
and
never
so
long
as
she
lived
would
she
be
able
to
forget
those
days
or
to
speak
of
them
easily
so
she
stood
by
the
window
trying
not
to
cry
and
a
little
donkey
drawing
a
coster
cart
moved
out
in
front
of
the
traffic
and
was
caught
by
a
motor
bus
there
was
only
time
for
the
picture
the
tiny
beast
lying
there
and
her
owner
wringing
his
hands
such
of
the
traffic
as
could
get
by
swerved
and
went
on
london
must
move
though
a
thousand
willing
little
beasts
lay
dying
and
sara
moved
too
one
moment
she
was
there
by
the
window
and
the
next
she
had
given
a
stifled
cry
and
ran
out
bless
my
soul
said
travers
and
got
up
slowly
henri
was
already
up
and
at
the
window
what
he
saw
was
sara
lee
making
her
way
through
the
stream
of
vehicles
taking
a
dozen
chances
for
her
life
henri
waited
until
he
saw
her
crouched
by
the
donkey
its
head
on
her
knee
then
he
too
ran
out
that
is
how
henri
of
no
other
name
that
may
be
given
met
sara
lee
kennedy
of
pennsylvania
under
a
london
motor
bus
and
that
i
think
will
be
the
picture
he
carries
of
her
until
he
dies
her
soft
eyes
full
of
pity
utterly
regardless
of
the
dirt
and
the
crowd
and
an
expostulating
bobby
with
that
grotesque
and
agonized
head
on
her
knees
henri
crawled
under
the
bus
though
the
policeman
was
extremely
anxious
to
keep
him
out
and
he
ran
a
practiced
eye
over
the
injured
donkey
it
dying
said
sara
lee
with
white
lips
it
will
die
replied
henri
but
how
soon
they
are
very
strong
these
little
beasts
the
conductor
of
the
bus
made
a
suggestion
then
one
that
froze
the
blood
round
sara
lee
heart
if
you
move
away
and
let
us
run
over
it
proper
it
be
out
of
its
trouble
miss
sara
lee
raised
haggard
eyes
to
henri
did
you
hear
that
she
said
they
do
it
too
the
total
result
of
a
conference
between
four
policemen
the
costermonger
and
by
that
time
travers
was
to
draw
the
animal
off
the
street
and
into
the
square
sara
lee
stuck
close
by
so
naturally
did
henri
and
when
the
hopeless
condition
of
nellie
as
they
learned
she
was
named
became
increasingly
evident
henri
behaved
like
a
man
and
a
soldier
he
got
out
his
revolver
and
shot
her
in
the
brain
a
kindness
he
explained
as
sara
lee
would
have
caught
his
hand
the
only
way
mademoiselle
travers
had
the
usual
british
hatred
of
a
crowd
and
publicity
coupled
with
a
deadly
fear
of
getting
into
the
papers
except
through
an
occasional
letter
to
the
he
vanished
just
before
the
shot
and
might
have
been
seen
moving
rapidly
through
the
square
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
treat
young
american
girls
like
rational
human
beings
but
henri
understood
he
had
had
a
french
mother
and
there
is
a
leaven
of
french
blood
in
the
american
temperament
old
huguenot
some
of
it
so
americans
love
beauty
and
obey
their
impulses
and
find
life
good
to
do
things
rather
than
to
be
something
or
other
more
or
less
important
and
so
henri
could
quite
understand
how
sara
lee
had
forgotten
herself
when
travers
could
not
and
he
understood
also
when
sara
lee
having
composed
the
little
donkey
quiet
figure
straightened
up
with
tears
in
her
eyes
it
was
very
dear
of
you
to
come
out
she
said
and
of
course
it
was
the
best
thing
she
held
out
her
hand
the
crowd
had
gone
traffic
was
moving
again
racing
to
make
up
for
five
lost
precious
moments
the
square
was
dark
that
first
darkness
of
london
when
air
raids
were
threatened
but
had
not
yet
taken
place
from
the
top
of
the
admiralty
near
by
a
flashlight
shot
up
into
the
air
and
began
its
nightly
process
of
brushing
the
sky
henri
took
her
hand
and
bent
over
it
you
are
very
brave
mademoiselle
he
said
and
touched
her
hand
with
his
lips
the
amazing
interlude
had
commenced
v
yet
for
a
day
or
two
nothing
much
was
changed
travers
sent
sara
lee
a
note
that
he
was
taking
up
her
problem
with
the
foreign
office
and
he
did
indeed
make
an
attempt
he
also
requested
his
wife
to
ask
sara
lee
to
tea
sara
lee
was
extremely
nervous
on
the
day
she
went
she
wore
a
black
jacket
suit
with
a
white
collar
and
she
carried
aunt
harriet
mink
furs
aunt
harriet
mourning
thoroughly
and
completely
in
black
astrachan
she
had
the
faculty
of
the
young
american
girl
of
looking
smart
without
much
expense
and
she
appeared
absurdly
young
she
followed
the
neat
maid
up
a
wide
staircase
to
a
door
with
a
screen
just
inside
and
heard
her
name
announced
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
sara
lee
took
a
long
breath
and
went
inside
to
a
most
discouraging
half
hour
travers
was
on
the
hearth
rug
travers
was
in
a
chair
a
portly
woman
with
a
not
unkindly
face
but
the
brusque
manner
many
englishwomen
acquire
after
forty
she
held
sara
lee
hand
and
gave
her
a
complete
if
smiling
inspection
and
it
is
you
who
are
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
get
to
the
front
you
child
sara
lee
heart
fell
but
she
smiled
also
but
i
am
older
than
i
look
she
said
and
i
am
very
strong
travers
looked
helplessly
at
her
husband
while
she
rang
the
bell
for
tea
that
was
another
thing
sara
lee
had
read
about
but
never
seen
that
ringing
for
tea
at
home
no
one
served
afternoon
tea
but
at
a
party
when
refreshments
were
coming
the
hostess
slipped
out
to
the
kitchen
and
gave
a
whispered
order
or
two
i
shall
be
frank
with
you
said
travers
i
think
it
quite
impossible
it
is
not
getting
you
over
that
might
be
done
and
of
course
there
are
women
over
there
young
ones
too
but
the
army
objects
very
seriously
to
their
being
in
danger
and
of
course
one
never
knows
her
voice
trailed
off
vaguely
she
implied
however
that
what
one
never
knows
was
best
unknown
i
have
a
niece
over
there
she
said
as
the
tea
tray
came
in
her
mother
was
fool
enough
to
let
her
go
now
they
ca
get
her
back
oh
dear
said
sara
lee
ca
they
find
her
she
wo
come
little
idiot
she
in
paris
however
i
daresay
she
is
safe
enough
travers
made
the
tea
thoughtfully
so
far
travers
had
hardly
spoken
but
he
cheered
in
true
british
fashion
at
the
sight
of
the
tea
sara
lee
exceedingly
curious
as
to
the
purpose
of
a
very
small
stand
somewhat
resembling
a
piano
stool
which
the
maid
had
placed
at
her
knee
learned
that
it
was
to
hold
her
muffin
plate
and
now
said
travers
suppose
we
come
to
the
point
there
does
seem
to
be
a
chance
to
get
you
over
my
child
same
answer
everywhere
place
is
full
of
untrained
women
spies
have
been
using
red
cross
passes
result
is
that
all
the
lines
are
drawn
as
tight
as
possible
sara
lee
stared
at
him
with
wide
eyes
but
i
ca
go
back
she
said
i
well
i
just
ca
raising
the
money
for
me
and
all
sorts
of
people
are
giving
things
a
a
friend
of
mine
is
baking
cakes
and
sending
on
the
money
she
has
three
children
and
she
gulped
i
thought
everybody
wanted
to
get
help
to
the
belgians
she
said
a
slightly
grim
smile
showed
itself
on
travers
face
i
afraid
you
do
understand
it
is
you
we
want
to
help
neither
travers
nor
i
feel
that
a
girl
so
young
as
you
and
alone
has
any
place
near
the
firing
line
and
that
i
fancy
is
where
you
wish
to
go
as
to
helping
the
belgians
we
have
four
in
the
house
now
they
do
not
belong
to
the
same
social
circles
so
they
prefer
tea
in
their
own
rooms
you
are
quite
right
about
their
needing
help
too
they
can
not
even
make
up
their
own
beds
they
are
not
all
like
that
broke
in
travers
hastily
of
course
not
but
i
merely
think
that
miss
er
kennedy
should
know
both
sides
of
the
picture
somewhat
later
sara
lee
was
ushered
downstairs
by
the
neat
maid
who
stood
on
the
steps
and
blew
a
whistle
for
a
taxi
sara
lee
had
come
in
a
bus
she
carried
in
her
hand
the
address
of
a
belgian
commission
of
relief
at
the
savoy
hotel
and
in
her
heart
for
the
first
time
a
doubt
of
her
errand
she
gave
the
savoy
address
mechanically
and
huddled
in
a
corner
gave
way
to
wild
and
fearful
misgivings
coming
up
she
had
sat
on
top
of
the
bus
and
watched
with
wide
curious
eyes
the
strange
traffic
of
london
the
park
had
fascinated
her
the
little
groups
of
drilling
men
in
khaki
the
mellow
tones
of
a
bugle
and
here
and
there
on
the
bridle
paths
men
and
women
on
horseback
as
as
the
horses
they
rode
and
on
the
surface
as
careless
of
what
was
happening
across
the
channel
but
she
saw
nothing
now
she
sat
back
and
twisted
harvey
ring
on
her
finger
and
saw
herself
going
back
her
work
undone
her
faith
in
herself
shattered
and
harvey
arms
and
the
leete
house
ready
to
receive
her
however
a
ray
of
hope
opened
for
her
at
the
savoy
not
much
a
prospect
the
savoy
was
crowded
men
in
uniform
a
sprinkling
of
wives
and
daughters
and
more
than
a
sprinkling
of
gaily
dressed
and
painted
women
filled
the
lobby
or
made
their
way
slowly
up
and
down
the
staircase
it
was
all
so
utterly
different
from
what
she
had
expected
so
bright
so
full
of
life
these
people
they
seemed
happy
enough
were
they
all
wrong
back
home
was
the
war
the
ghastly
thing
they
thought
it
long
months
afterward
sara
lee
was
to
learn
that
the
savoy
was
not
london
she
was
to
learn
other
things
that
america
knew
more
through
a
free
press
of
war
conditions
than
did
england
and
she
was
to
learn
what
never
ceased
to
surprise
her
the
sporting
instinct
of
the
british
which
made
their
early
slogan
business
as
usual
business
and
pleasure
but
only
on
the
surface
underneath
was
a
dogged
and
obstinate
determination
to
make
up
as
soon
as
possible
for
the
humiliation
of
the
early
days
of
the
war
those
were
the
transition
days
in
england
the
people
were
slowly
awaking
to
the
magnitude
of
the
thing
that
was
happening
to
them
certain
elements
of
the
press
long
under
political
dominion
were
preparing
to
come
out
for
a
coalition
ministry
the
question
of
shells
as
against
shrapnel
was
bitterly
fought
some
of
the
men
at
home
standing
fast
for
shrapnel
as
valuable
against
german
artillery
as
a
garden
hose
men
coming
back
from
the
front
were
pleading
for
real
help
not
men
only
not
red
cross
not
food
and
supplies
but
for
something
more
competent
than
mere
man
power
to
hold
back
the
deluge
but
over
it
all
was
that
surface
cheerfulness
that
attitude
of
london
and
sara
lee
saw
only
that
and
lost
faith
she
had
come
far
to
help
but
here
was
food
in
plenty
and
bands
playing
and
smiling
men
in
uniform
drinking
tea
and
playing
for
a
little
that
too
sara
lee
was
to
understand
later
but
just
then
she
did
not
at
home
there
was
more
surface
depression
the
atrocities
the
plight
of
the
belgians
the
honor
list
in
the
london
that
was
the
war
to
sara
lee
and
here
but
later
on
down
in
a
crowded
dark
little
room
things
were
different
she
was
one
of
a
long
line
mostly
women
they
were
unhappy
and
desolate
enough
god
knows
they
sat
or
stood
with
a
sort
of
weary
resignation
now
and
then
a
short
heavy
man
with
an
upcurled
mustache
came
out
and
took
in
one
or
two
the
door
closed
and
overhead
the
band
played
monotonously
it
was
after
seven
when
sara
lee
turn
came
the
man
spoke
to
her
in
french
but
he
failed
to
use
a
single
one
of
the
words
she
had
memorized
do
you
speak
any
english
she
asked
helplessly
i
do
but
not
much
he
replied
though
his
french
had
been
rapid
he
spoke
english
slowly
how
can
we
serve
you
mademoiselle
i
do
want
any
assistance
i
i
want
to
help
if
i
can
here
in
france
or
belgium
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
have
many
offers
of
help
what
we
need
mademoiselle
is
not
workers
we
have
at
our
base
hospital
already
many
english
nurses
i
am
not
a
nurse
i
am
sorry
the
whole
world
is
sorry
for
belgium
and
many
would
work
what
we
need
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
is
food
clothing
supplies
for
our
brave
little
soldiers
sara
lee
looked
extremely
small
and
young
the
belgian
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
surveyed
her
carefully
you
english
are
doing
a
a
fine
work
for
us
he
observed
we
are
grateful
but
of
course
the
he
hesitated
the
pulling
up
of
an
entire
people
it
is
colossal
but
i
am
not
english
said
sara
lee
and
i
have
a
little
money
i
want
to
make
soup
for
your
wounded
men
at
a
railway
station
or
any
place
i
can
make
good
soup
and
i
shall
have
money
each
month
to
buy
what
i
need
only
then
was
sara
lee
admitted
to
the
crowded
little
room
long
afterward
when
the
lights
behind
the
back
drop
had
gone
down
and
sara
lee
was
back
again
in
her
familiar
setting
one
of
the
clearest
pictures
she
retained
of
that
amazing
interlude
was
of
that
crowded
little
room
in
the
savoy
its
single
littered
desk
its
two
typewriters
creating
an
incredible
din
a
large
gentleman
in
a
military
cape
seeming
to
fill
the
room
and
in
corners
and
off
stage
so
to
speak
perhaps
a
half
dozen
men
watching
her
curiously
the
conversation
was
in
french
and
sara
lee
acquaintance
of
the
passage
acted
as
interpreter
it
was
only
when
sara
lee
found
that
a
considerable
discussion
was
going
on
in
which
she
had
no
part
that
she
looked
round
and
saw
her
friend
of
two
nights
before
and
of
the
little
donkey
he
was
watching
her
intently
and
when
he
caught
her
eye
he
bowed
now
men
in
sara
lee
mind
had
until
now
been
divided
into
the
ones
at
home
one
own
kind
the
sort
who
married
one
friends
or
oneself
the
kind
who
called
their
wives
mother
after
the
first
baby
came
and
were
easily
understood
plain
men
decent
and
and
and
the
men
of
that
world
outside
america
who
were
foreigners
one
might
like
foreigners
but
they
were
outsiders
so
there
was
no
in
sara
lee
bow
and
smile
later
on
henri
was
to
find
that
lack
of
self
and
sex
consciousness
one
of
the
maddening
mysteries
about
sara
lee
perhaps
he
never
quite
understood
it
but
always
he
respected
it
more
conversation
in
an
increasing
staccato
short
contributions
from
the
men
crowded
into
corners
frenzied
beating
of
the
typewriting
machines
and
overhead
and
far
away
the
band
there
was
no
air
in
the
room
sara
lee
was
to
find
out
a
great
deal
later
on
about
the
contempt
of
the
belgians
for
air
she
loosened
aunt
harriet
neckpiece
so
far
henri
had
not
joined
in
the
discussion
but
now
he
came
forward
and
spoke
also
having
finished
he
interpreted
to
sara
lee
they
are
most
grateful
he
explained
it
is
a
a
practical
idea
mademoiselle
if
you
were
in
belgium
he
smiled
rather
mirthlessly
if
you
were
already
in
the
very
small
part
of
belgium
remaining
to
us
we
could
place
you
very
usefully
but
the
british
war
office
is
most
careful
just
now
you
understand
there
are
reasons
sara
lee
flushed
indignantly
they
can
watch
me
if
they
want
to
she
said
what
trouble
can
i
make
i
only
just
landed
you
you
have
to
go
a
good
ways
to
find
any
one
who
knows
less
than
i
do
about
the
war
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
he
said
unconscious
of
offense
but
the
war
office
he
held
out
his
hands
sara
lee
who
had
already
caught
the
british
a
and
was
rather
overdoing
it
had
a
wild
impulse
to
make
the
same
gesture
it
meant
so
much
more
conversation
evidently
more
difficulties
but
with
henri
now
holding
the
center
of
the
stage
and
speaking
rapidly
the
man
retired
and
read
letters
under
an
electric
lamp
the
band
upstairs
was
having
dinner
and
henri
argued
and
wrangled
he
was
quite
passionate
the
man
in
the
military
cape
listened
and
smiled
and
at
last
he
nodded
henri
turned
to
sara
lee
you
americans
are
all
brave
he
said
you
like
what
is
it
you
say
taking
a
chance
i
think
would
you
care
to
take
such
a
chance
what
sort
of
a
chance
may
i
visit
you
this
evening
at
your
hotel
just
for
an
instant
sara
lee
hesitated
there
was
harvey
at
home
he
would
not
like
her
receiving
a
call
from
any
man
and
harvey
did
not
like
foreigners
he
always
said
they
had
no
respect
for
women
it
struck
her
suddenly
what
harvey
would
call
henri
bowing
and
his
kissing
her
hand
and
his
passionate
gesticulations
when
he
was
excited
he
would
call
it
all
tomfool
nonsense
and
she
recalled
his
final
words
his
arms
so
close
about
her
that
she
could
hardly
breathe
his
voice
husky
with
emotion
just
let
me
hear
of
any
of
those
foreigners
bothering
you
he
said
and
i
go
over
and
wipe
out
the
whole
damned
nation
it
had
not
sounded
funny
then
it
was
not
funny
now
please
come
said
sara
lee
in
a
small
voice
the
other
gentlemen
bowed
profoundly
sara
lee
rather
at
a
loss
gave
them
a
friendly
smile
that
included
them
all
and
then
she
and
henri
were
walking
up
the
stairs
and
to
the
entrance
henri
tall
figure
the
target
for
many
women
eyes
he
however
saw
no
one
but
sara
lee
henri
too
called
a
taxicab
every
one
in
london
seemed
to
ride
in
taxis
and
he
bent
over
her
hand
once
she
was
in
the
car
but
he
did
not
kiss
it
it
is
very
kind
of
you
what
you
are
doing
he
said
but
then
you
americans
are
all
kind
and
wonderful
back
at
morley
hotel
sara
lee
had
a
short
conversation
with
picture
you
are
entirely
wrong
dear
she
said
she
was
brushing
her
hair
at
the
time
and
it
is
rather
a
pity
that
it
was
a
profile
picture
and
that
harvey
pictured
eyes
were
looking
off
into
space
that
is
a
piece
of
white
canvas
on
a
frame
used
by
photographers
to
reflect
the
light
into
the
eyes
for
sara
lee
with
her
hair
down
was
even
lovelier
than
with
it
up
you
were
wrong
they
are
different
but
they
are
kind
and
polite
and
very
very
respectful
and
he
is
coming
on
business
she
intended
at
first
to
make
no
change
in
her
frock
after
all
it
was
not
a
social
call
and
if
she
did
not
dress
it
would
put
things
on
the
right
footing
but
slipping
along
the
corridor
after
her
bath
clad
in
a
kimono
and
slippers
and
extremely
nervous
she
encountered
a
young
woman
on
her
way
to
dinner
and
she
was
dressed
in
that
combination
of
street
skirt
and
evening
blouse
that
some
englishwomen
from
the
outlying
districts
still
affect
and
sara
lee
thereupon
decided
to
dress
she
called
in
the
elderly
maid
who
was
already
her
slave
and
together
they
went
over
her
clothes
it
was
the
maid
perhaps
then
who
brought
into
sara
lee
life
the
strange
and
mad
infatuation
for
her
that
was
gradually
to
become
a
dominant
issue
in
the
next
few
months
for
the
maid
chose
a
white
dress
a
soft
and
young
affair
in
which
sara
lee
looked
like
the
heart
of
a
rose
i
always
like
to
see
a
young
lady
in
white
miss
said
the
maid
especially
when
there
a
healthy
skin
so
sara
lee
ate
her
dinner
alone
such
a
dinner
as
a
healthy
skin
and
body
demanded
and
she
watched
tall
young
englishwomen
with
fine
shoulders
go
out
with
english
officers
in
khaki
and
listened
to
a
babel
of
high
english
voices
and
felt
extremely
alone
and
very
subdued
henri
came
rather
late
it
was
one
of
the
things
she
was
to
learn
about
him
later
that
he
was
frequently
late
it
was
only
long
afterward
that
she
realized
that
such
time
as
he
spent
with
her
was
gained
only
at
the
cost
of
almost
superhuman
effort
but
that
was
when
she
knew
story
and
his
work
she
waited
for
him
in
the
reception
room
where
a
man
and
a
woman
were
having
coffee
and
talking
in
a
strange
tongue
henri
found
her
there
at
something
before
nine
rather
downcast
and
worried
and
debating
about
going
up
to
bed
she
looked
up
to
find
him
bowing
before
her
i
thought
you
were
not
coming
she
said
i
not
come
but
i
had
said
that
i
would
come
mademoiselle
i
may
sit
down
sara
lee
moved
over
on
the
velvet
sofa
and
henri
lowered
his
long
body
onto
it
lowered
his
voice
too
for
the
man
and
woman
were
staring
at
him
i
afraid
i
did
quite
understand
about
this
afternoon
began
sara
lee
you
spoke
about
taking
a
chance
i
am
not
afraid
of
danger
if
that
is
what
you
mean
that
and
a
little
more
mademoiselle
said
henri
but
now
that
i
am
here
i
do
not
know
his
eyes
were
keen
sara
lee
had
suddenly
a
strange
feeling
that
he
was
watching
the
couple
who
talked
over
their
coffee
and
that
oddly
enough
the
couple
were
watching
him
yet
he
was
apparently
giving
his
undivided
attention
to
her
have
you
walked
any
he
asked
her
unexpectedly
sara
lee
remembered
the
bus
and
with
some
bitterness
the
two
taxis
i
have
had
a
chance
to
walk
she
said
but
you
should
walk
he
said
i
will
you
walk
with
me
just
about
the
square
for
air
and
in
a
lower
tone
it
is
not
necessary
that
those
two
should
know
the
plan
mademoiselle
i
get
my
coat
and
hat
sara
lee
said
and
proceeded
to
do
so
in
a
brisk
and
businesslike
fashion
when
she
came
down
henri
was
emerging
from
the
telephone
booth
his
face
was
impassive
and
again
when
in
time
sara
lee
was
to
know
henri
face
better
than
she
had
ever
known
harvey
she
was
to
learn
that
the
masklike
look
he
sometimes
wore
meant
danger
for
somebody
they
went
out
without
further
speech
into
the
clear
cold
night
henri
as
if
from
custom
threw
his
head
back
and
scanned
the
sky
then
they
went
on
and
crossed
into
the
square
the
plan
henri
began
abruptly
is
this
you
will
be
provided
with
a
passport
to
boulogne
you
will
if
you
agree
take
the
midnight
train
for
folkestone
at
the
railway
station
here
you
will
be
searched
at
folkestone
a
board
sitting
in
an
office
on
the
quay
will
examine
your
passport
does
any
one
in
boulogne
speak
english
sara
lee
inquired
nervously
somehow
that
babel
of
french
at
the
savoy
had
frightened
her
her
little
phrase
book
seemed
pitifully
inadequate
for
the
great
things
in
her
mind
that
hardly
matters
said
henri
smiling
faintly
because
i
think
you
shall
not
go
to
boulogne
not
go
she
stopped
dead
under
the
monument
and
looked
up
at
him
the
place
for
you
to
go
to
start
from
is
calais
henri
explained
he
paused
to
let
pass
two
lovers
a
man
in
khaki
and
a
girl
but
calais
is
difficult
it
is
under
martial
law
a
closed
city
from
boulogne
to
calais
would
be
perhaps
impossible
sara
lee
was
american
and
her
methods
were
direct
how
can
i
get
to
calais
will
you
take
the
chance
i
spoke
of
for
goodness
sake
said
sara
lee
in
an
exasperated
tone
how
can
i
tell
you
until
i
know
what
it
is
henri
told
her
he
even
standing
under
a
street
lamp
drew
a
small
sketch
for
her
to
make
it
clear
sara
lee
stood
close
watching
him
and
some
of
the
lines
were
not
as
steady
as
they
might
have
been
and
in
the
midst
of
it
he
suddenly
stopped
do
you
know
what
it
means
he
demanded
yes
of
course
and
you
know
what
date
this
is
the
eighteenth
of
february
but
he
saw
after
all
that
she
did
not
entirely
understand
this
eighteenth
of
february
the
germans
commence
a
blockade
of
this
coast
no
vessels
if
they
can
prevent
them
will
leave
the
harbors
or
if
they
do
none
shall
reach
the
other
side
oh
said
sara
lee
blankly
we
are
eager
to
do
as
you
wish
mademoiselle
but
he
commenced
slowly
to
tear
up
the
sketch
it
is
too
dangerous
you
are
too
young
if
anything
should
go
wrong
and
i
had
no
we
will
find
another
way
he
put
the
fragments
of
the
sketch
in
his
pocket
how
long
is
this
blockade
to
last
sara
lee
asked
out
of
bitter
disappointment
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
who
can
say
a
week
a
year
not
at
all
then
said
sara
lee
with
calm
deliberation
you
might
as
well
get
out
your
pencil
and
draw
another
picture
because
i
going
far
enough
away
now
the
little
house
at
home
and
the
peace
that
dwelt
therein
and
harvey
and
the
small
white
bedroom
and
the
daily
round
of
quiet
duties
sara
lee
had
set
her
face
toward
the
east
and
the
land
of
dying
men
and
as
henri
looked
down
at
her
she
had
again
that
poised
and
eager
look
almost
of
flight
that
had
brought
into
harvey
love
for
her
just
a
touch
of
fear
vi
sara
lee
kennedy
was
up
at
dawn
the
next
morning
there
was
a
very
serious
matter
to
decide
for
henri
plan
had
included
only
such
hand
luggage
as
she
herself
could
carry
sara
lee
carefully
laid
out
on
the
bed
such
articles
as
she
could
not
possibly
do
without
and
was
able
to
pack
into
her
suitcase
less
than
a
fourth
of
them
she
had
fortunately
brought
a
soft
wool
sweater
which
required
little
room
undergarments
several
blouses
the
sweater
and
a
pair
of
heavy
shoes
that
was
her
equipment
plus
such
small
toilet
outfit
as
is
necessary
when
a
young
woman
uses
no
and
regards
cold
cream
only
as
a
remedy
for
chapped
hands
the
maid
found
her
in
rather
a
dismal
mood
going
across
miss
she
said
fancy
that
it
a
secret
cautioned
sara
lee
i
am
really
not
sure
i
am
going
i
am
only
trying
to
go
the
maid
who
found
sara
lee
and
the
picture
of
harvey
on
her
dressing
table
both
romantic
and
appealing
offered
to
pack
from
the
first
moment
it
was
evident
that
she
meant
to
include
the
white
dress
indeed
she
packed
it
first
you
never
know
what
going
to
happen
over
there
she
asserted
they
do
say
that
royalties
are
everywhere
going
about
like
common
people
you
better
have
a
good
frock
with
you
she
had
an
air
of
subdued
excitement
and
after
she
had
established
the
fact
that
not
only
the
white
frock
but
slippers
and
hose
also
would
go
in
she
went
to
the
door
and
glanced
up
and
down
the
passage
then
she
closed
the
door
there
was
queer
here
last
night
miss
she
said
cautiously
spies
oh
no
cried
sara
lee
spies
she
repeated
a
man
and
a
woman
pretending
to
be
belgian
refugees
they
took
them
away
at
daylight
i
expect
by
now
been
shot
sara
lee
ate
very
little
breakfast
that
morning
all
through
england
it
was
confidently
believed
that
spies
were
shot
on
discovery
a
theory
that
has
been
persistent
and
false
save
at
the
battle
line
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
henri
plan
assumed
new
proportions
suppose
she
made
her
attempt
and
failed
suppose
they
took
her
for
a
spy
and
that
tomorrow
sun
found
her
facing
a
firing
squad
not
indeed
that
she
had
ever
heard
of
a
firing
squad
as
such
but
she
had
seen
spies
shot
in
the
movies
they
invariably
stood
in
front
of
a
brick
wall
with
the
hero
in
the
center
so
she
ate
her
kippered
herring
which
had
been
strongly
recommended
by
the
waiter
and
tried
to
think
of
what
a
spy
would
do
so
she
might
avoid
any
suspicious
movements
it
struck
her
too
that
war
seemed
to
have
made
the
people
on
that
side
of
the
ocean
extremely
ready
with
weapons
they
would
be
quite
likely
to
shoot
first
and
ask
questions
afterwards
which
would
be
too
late
to
be
helpful
she
remembered
henri
for
instance
and
the
way
without
a
word
he
had
shot
the
donkey
that
day
she
wrote
harvey
a
letter
it
began
i
think
i
am
to
leave
for
france
things
seem
to
be
moving
nicely
and
i
am
being
helped
by
the
belgian
relief
commission
it
is
composed
of
belgians
and
is
at
the
savoy
hotel
here
she
stopped
and
cried
a
little
what
if
she
should
never
see
harvey
again
never
have
his
sturdy
arms
about
her
harvey
gained
by
distance
she
remembered
only
his
unfailing
kindness
and
strength
and
his
love
for
her
he
seemed
here
at
the
edge
of
the
whirlpool
a
sort
of
eddy
of
peace
and
quiet
even
then
she
had
no
thought
of
going
back
until
her
work
was
done
but
she
did
an
unusual
thing
for
her
unused
to
demonstration
of
any
sort
she
kissed
his
ring
followed
directions
about
sending
the
money
from
the
church
society
a
description
of
morley
and
trafalgar
square
an
account
of
tea
at
the
travers
and
of
the
little
donkey
without
mention
however
of
henri
she
felt
that
harvey
would
not
understand
henri
but
at
the
end
came
the
passage
which
poor
harvey
read
and
when
the
letter
came
and
alternately
ground
his
teeth
over
and
kissed
i
do
love
you
harvey
dear
and
i
am
coming
back
to
you
i
have
felt
that
i
had
to
do
what
i
am
doing
but
i
am
coming
back
that
a
promise
unless
of
course
i
should
take
sick
or
something
like
that
which
is
likely
there
was
a
long
pause
in
the
writing
here
but
harvey
could
not
know
that
i
shall
wear
your
ring
always
and
always
harvey
it
will
mean
to
me
that
i
belong
to
you
with
dearest
love
sara
lee
then
she
added
a
postscript
of
course
the
war
office
is
not
letting
people
cross
to
calais
just
now
but
i
am
going
to
do
it
anyhow
it
is
perfectly
simple
and
when
i
get
over
i
shall
write
and
tell
you
how
it
was
the
next
day
that
an
indignant
official
in
the
censor
office
read
that
postscript
and
rose
in
his
wrath
and
sent
a
third
to
look
up
sara
lee
at
morley
but
by
this
time
she
was
embarked
on
the
big
adventure
and
by
the
time
a
cable
reached
calais
there
was
no
trace
of
sara
lee
during
the
afternoon
she
called
up
travers
at
his
office
and
rather
gathered
that
he
did
not
care
to
use
the
telephone
during
business
hours
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
you
need
not
bother
about
me
any
more
she
said
i
am
being
sent
over
and
i
think
everything
is
all
right
he
was
greatly
relieved
travers
had
not
fully
indorsed
his
encomiums
of
the
girl
she
had
felt
that
no
really
nice
girl
would
travel
so
far
on
so
precarious
an
errand
particularly
when
she
was
alone
and
how
could
one
tell
coming
from
america
how
her
sympathies
really
lay
she
might
be
of
german
parentage
the
very
worst
sort
because
they
spoke
american
it
was
easy
enough
to
change
a
name
nevertheless
travers
felt
a
trifle
low
in
his
mind
when
he
hung
up
the
receiver
he
said
twice
to
himself
twenty
pounds
and
at
last
he
put
four
sovereigns
in
an
envelope
and
sent
them
to
her
anonymously
by
messenger
sara
lee
guessed
whence
they
came
but
she
respected
the
manner
of
the
gift
and
did
not
thank
him
it
was
almost
the
first
gold
money
she
had
ever
seen
she
was
very
carefully
searched
at
the
railway
station
that
night
and
found
that
her
american
red
cross
button
which
had
come
with
her
dollar
subscription
to
the
association
made
the
matron
inspector
rather
kindly
inclined
nevertheless
she
took
off
sara
lee
shoes
and
ran
over
the
lining
of
her
coat
and
quite
ruined
the
maid
packing
of
the
suitcase
you
are
going
to
boulogne
asked
the
matron
inspector
sara
lee
did
not
like
to
lie
wherever
the
boat
takes
me
she
said
with
smile
the
matron
smiled
too
i
should
be
nervous
miss
she
said
it
a
chance
of
course
but
they
have
not
done
much
damage
yet
it
was
after
midnight
then
and
a
cold
fog
made
the
station
a
gloomy
thing
of
blurred
yellow
lights
and
raw
chill
a
few
people
moved
about
mostly
officers
in
uniform
half
a
dozen
men
in
civilian
clothes
eyed
her
as
she
passed
through
the
gates
scotland
yard
but
she
did
not
know
and
once
she
thought
she
saw
henri
but
he
walked
away
into
the
shadows
and
disappeared
the
train
looking
as
absurdly
small
and
light
as
all
english
trains
do
was
waiting
out
in
the
shed
there
were
no
porters
and
sara
lee
carried
her
own
bag
she
felt
quite
sure
she
had
been
mistaken
about
henri
for
of
course
he
would
have
come
and
carried
it
for
her
the
train
was
cold
and
quiet
when
it
finally
moved
out
it
was
under
way
before
she
knew
that
it
was
going
and
then
suddenly
sara
heart
began
to
pound
hard
it
was
a
very
cold
and
shivering
sara
lee
who
curled
up
alone
in
her
compartment
and
stared
hard
at
harvey
ring
to
keep
her
courage
up
but
a
curious
thing
had
happened
harvey
gave
her
no
moral
support
he
brought
her
only
disapproval
she
found
herself
remembering
none
of
the
loving
things
he
had
said
to
her
but
only
the
bitter
ones
perhaps
it
was
the
best
thing
for
her
after
all
for
a
sort
of
dogged
determination
to
go
through
with
it
all
at
any
cost
braced
her
to
her
final
effort
so
far
it
had
all
been
busy
enough
but
not
comfortable
she
was
cold
and
she
had
eaten
almost
nothing
all
day
as
the
hours
went
on
and
the
train
slid
through
the
darkness
she
realized
that
she
was
rather
faint
the
steam
pipes
only
warm
at
the
start
were
entirely
cold
by
one
and
by
two
sara
lee
was
sitting
on
her
feet
with
a
heavy
coat
wrapped
about
her
knees
the
train
moved
quietly
as
do
all
english
trains
with
no
jars
and
little
sound
there
were
few
lights
outside
for
the
towns
of
eastern
england
were
darkened
like
london
against
air
attacks
so
when
she
looked
at
the
window
she
saw
only
her
own
reflection
white
and
above
aunt
harriet
fur
neckpiece
in
the
next
compartment
an
officer
was
snoring
but
she
did
not
close
her
eyes
perhaps
for
that
last
hour
some
of
the
glow
that
had
brought
her
so
far
failed
her
she
was
not
able
to
think
beyond
folkestone
save
occasionally
and
that
with
a
feeling
that
it
should
not
be
made
so
difficult
to
do
a
kind
and
helpful
thing
at
a
quarter
before
three
the
train
eased
down
in
the
same
proportion
sara
lee
pulse
went
up
a
long
period
of
crawling
along
a
stop
or
two
but
no
resultant
opening
of
the
doors
and
at
last
in
a
cold
rain
and
a
howling
wind
from
the
channel
the
little
seaport
city
more
officers
than
she
had
suspected
a
few
women
got
out
the
latter
sara
lee
experience
on
the
steamer
enabled
her
to
place
buyers
mostly
and
americans
on
their
way
to
paris
blockade
or
no
blockade
because
the
american
woman
must
be
well
and
smartly
gowned
and
hatted
a
man
with
a
mourning
band
on
his
sleeve
carried
a
wailing
child
the
officers
lighted
cigarettes
the
civilians
formed
a
line
on
the
jetty
under
the
roof
of
the
shed
and
waited
passports
in
hand
before
a
door
that
gleamed
with
yellow
light
faces
looked
pale
and
anxious
the
blockade
was
on
and
germany
had
said
that
no
ships
would
cross
that
night
as
if
defiantly
the
boulogne
boat
near
at
hand
was
ablaze
on
the
shore
side
at
least
with
lights
stewards
came
and
went
beyond
it
lay
the
harbor
dark
and
mysterious
save
where
from
somewhere
across
a
flashlight
made
a
brave
effort
to
pierce
the
fog
one
of
the
buyers
ahead
of
sara
lee
seemed
exhilarated
by
the
danger
ahead
they
never
get
us
she
said
look
at
that
fog
it
lifting
dearie
answered
a
weary
voice
behind
her
the
wind
is
carrying
it
away
when
sara
lee
turn
came
she
was
ready
a
group
of
men
in
civilian
clothes
seated
about
a
long
table
looked
her
over
carefully
her
passports
moved
deliberately
from
hand
to
hand
a
long
business
and
the
baby
wailing
harder
than
ever
but
the
office
was
at
least
warm
some
of
her
failing
courage
came
back
as
she
moved
following
her
papers
round
the
table
they
were
given
back
to
her
at
last
and
she
went
out
she
had
passed
the
first
ordeal
suitcase
in
hand
she
wandered
down
the
stone
jetty
the
boulogne
boat
she
passed
and
kept
on
at
the
very
end
dark
and
sinister
lay
another
boat
it
had
no
lights
the
tide
was
in
and
its
deck
lay
almost
flush
with
the
pier
sara
lee
walked
on
toward
it
until
a
voice
spoke
to
her
out
of
the
darkness
and
near
at
hand
your
boat
is
back
there
madam
i
know
thank
you
i
am
just
walking
about
the
petty
officer
he
was
a
petty
officer
though
sara
lee
had
never
heard
the
term
was
inclined
to
be
suspicious
under
excuse
of
lighting
his
pipe
he
struck
a
match
and
sara
lee
young
figure
stood
out
in
full
relief
his
suspicions
died
away
with
the
flare
bad
night
miss
he
offered
very
said
sara
lee
and
turned
back
again
this
time
bewildered
and
uneasy
she
certainly
saw
henri
but
he
ignored
her
he
was
alone
and
smoking
one
of
his
interminable
cigarettes
he
had
not
said
he
was
crossing
and
why
had
he
not
spoken
to
her
he
wandered
past
down
the
pier
and
she
lost
him
in
the
shadows
when
he
came
back
he
paused
near
her
and
at
last
saluted
and
spoke
he
said
if
you
will
stand
back
here
you
will
find
less
wind
thank
you
he
carried
her
suitcase
back
and
stooping
over
to
place
it
at
her
feet
he
said
i
shall
send
him
on
board
with
a
message
to
the
captain
when
i
come
back
try
again
he
left
her
at
once
the
passengers
for
boulogne
were
embarking
now
a
silent
lot
they
disappeared
into
the
warmth
and
brightness
of
the
little
boat
and
were
lost
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
sara
lee
standing
in
the
shadows
soon
henri
came
back
he
walked
briskly
and
touched
his
cap
as
he
passed
he
went
aboard
the
boulogne
steamer
and
without
a
backward
glance
disappeared
sara
lee
watched
him
out
of
sight
in
a
very
real
panic
he
had
been
something
real
and
tangible
in
that
shadowy
place
something
familiar
in
an
unfamiliar
world
but
he
was
gone
she
threw
up
her
head
so
once
more
sara
lee
picked
up
her
suitcase
and
went
down
the
pier
now
she
was
unchallenged
what
lurking
figure
might
be
on
the
dark
deck
of
the
calais
boat
she
could
not
tell
that
was
the
chance
she
was
to
take
the
gangway
was
still
out
and
as
quietly
as
possible
she
went
aboard
the
boulogne
boat
had
suddenly
gone
dark
and
she
heard
the
churning
of
the
screw
with
the
extinction
of
the
lights
on
the
other
boat
came
at
last
deeper
night
to
her
aid
a
few
steps
a
stumble
a
gasp
and
she
was
on
board
the
forbidden
ship
she
turned
forward
according
to
her
instructions
where
the
overhead
deck
made
below
an
even
deeper
shadow
henri
had
said
that
there
were
cabins
there
and
that
the
chance
was
of
finding
an
unlocked
one
if
they
were
all
locked
she
would
be
discovered
at
dawn
and
arrested
and
sara
lee
was
not
a
war
correspondent
she
was
not
accustomed
to
arrest
indeed
she
had
a
deep
conviction
that
arrest
in
her
case
would
mean
death
false
of
course
but
surely
it
shows
her
courage
as
she
stood
there
breathless
and
listening
the
boulogne
boat
moved
out
she
heard
the
wash
against
the
jetty
felt
the
rolling
of
its
waves
but
being
on
the
landward
side
she
could
not
see
the
faint
gleam
of
a
cigarette
that
marked
henri
anxious
figure
at
the
rail
so
long
as
the
black
hulk
of
the
calais
boat
was
visible
and
long
after
indeed
henri
stood
there
outwardly
calm
but
actually
shaken
by
many
fears
she
had
looked
so
small
and
young
and
who
could
know
what
deviltry
lurked
abroad
that
night
he
had
not
gone
with
her
because
it
was
necessary
that
he
be
in
boulogne
the
next
morning
and
also
the
very
chance
of
getting
her
across
lay
in
her
being
alone
and
unobserved
so
he
stood
by
the
rail
and
looked
back
and
said
a
wordless
little
prayer
that
if
there
was
trouble
it
come
to
his
boat
and
not
to
the
other
which
might
very
considerably
have
disturbed
the
buyers
had
they
known
of
it
and
believed
in
prayer
sara
lee
stood
in
the
shadows
and
listened
there
were
voices
overhead
from
the
bridge
a
door
opened
onto
the
deck
and
threw
out
a
ray
of
light
some
one
came
out
and
went
on
shore
walking
with
brisk
ringing
steps
and
then
at
last
she
put
down
her
bag
and
tried
door
after
door
without
result
the
man
who
had
gone
ashore
called
another
the
gangway
was
drawn
in
the
engines
began
to
vibrate
under
foot
sara
lee
breathless
and
terrified
stood
close
to
a
cabin
door
and
remained
immovable
at
one
moment
it
seemed
as
if
a
seaman
was
coming
forward
to
where
she
stood
but
he
did
not
come
the
calais
boat
was
waiting
until
the
other
steamer
had
got
well
out
of
the
harbor
the
fog
had
lifted
and
the
searchlight
was
moving
over
the
surface
it
played
round
the
channel
steamer
without
touching
it
but
none
of
this
was
visible
to
sara
lee
at
last
the
lights
of
the
quay
began
to
recede
the
little
boat
rocked
slightly
in
its
own
waves
as
it
edged
away
it
moved
slowly
through
the
shipping
and
out
until
catching
the
swell
of
the
channel
it
shot
ahead
at
top
speed
for
an
hour
sara
lee
stood
there
the
channel
wind
caught
her
and
tore
at
her
skirts
until
she
was
almost
frozen
and
finally
in
sheer
desperation
she
worked
her
way
round
to
the
other
side
she
saw
no
one
save
for
the
beating
heart
of
the
engine
below
it
might
have
been
a
dead
ship
on
the
other
side
she
found
an
open
door
and
stumbled
into
the
tiny
dark
deck
cabin
as
chilled
and
frightened
a
philanthropist
as
had
ever
crossed
that
old
and
tricky
and
soured
bit
of
seaway
and
there
to
be
frank
she
forgot
her
fright
in
as
bitter
a
tribute
of
seasickness
as
even
the
channel
has
ever
exacted
she
had
locked
herself
in
and
she
fell
at
last
into
an
exhausted
sleep
when
she
wakened
and
peered
out
through
the
tiny
window
it
was
gray
winter
dawn
the
boat
was
quiet
and
before
her
lay
the
quay
of
calais
and
the
gare
maritime
a
gangway
was
out
and
a
hurried
survey
showed
no
one
in
sight
sara
lee
picked
up
her
suitcase
and
opened
the
door
the
fresh
morning
air
revived
her
but
nevertheless
it
was
an
extremely
pale
young
woman
who
obeying
henri
instructions
went
ashore
that
morning
in
the
gray
dawn
unseen
undisturbed
and
unquestioned
but
from
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
gangway
until
the
double
glass
doors
of
the
gare
maritime
closed
behind
her
this
apparently
calm
young
woman
did
not
breathe
at
all
she
arrived
indeed
with
lungs
fairly
collapsed
and
her
heart
entirely
unreliable
a
woman
clerk
was
asleep
at
a
desk
sara
lee
roused
her
to
half
wakefulness
no
interest
and
extremely
poor
english
a
drowsy
porter
led
her
up
a
staircase
and
down
an
endless
corridor
then
at
last
he
was
gone
and
sara
lee
turned
the
key
in
her
door
and
burst
into
tears
vii
now
up
to
this
point
sara
lee
mind
had
come
to
rest
at
calais
she
must
get
there
after
that
the
other
things
would
need
to
be
worried
over
henri
had
already
in
their
short
acquaintance
installed
himself
as
the
central
figure
of
this
strange
and
amazing
interlude
not
as
a
young
soldier
surprisingly
fertile
in
expedients
but
as
a
sort
of
agent
of
providence
by
whom
and
through
whom
things
were
done
and
henri
had
said
she
was
to
go
to
the
gare
maritime
at
calais
and
make
herself
comfortable
if
she
got
there
after
that
things
would
be
arranged
sara
lee
therefore
took
a
hot
bath
though
hardly
a
satisfactory
one
for
there
was
no
soap
and
she
had
brought
none
she
learned
later
on
to
carry
soap
with
her
everywhere
so
she
soaked
the
chill
out
of
her
slim
body
and
then
dressed
the
room
was
cold
but
a
great
exultation
kept
her
warm
she
had
run
the
blockade
she
had
escaped
the
war
office
which
by
the
way
was
looking
her
up
almost
violently
by
that
time
via
the
censor
it
had
found
the
trunk
she
left
at
morley
and
the
maid
into
hysteria
and
here
she
was
safe
in
france
the
harbor
of
calais
before
her
and
here
and
there
war
craft
taking
on
coal
destroyers
she
learned
later
her
ignorance
was
rather
appalling
at
first
it
was
all
unreal
the
room
with
its
cold
steam
pipes
the
heavy
window
hangings
the
very
words
on
the
hot
and
cold
taps
in
the
bathroom
a
great
vessel
moved
into
the
harbor
as
it
turned
she
saw
its
name
printed
on
its
side
in
huge
letters
and
the
flag
also
painted
of
a
neutral
country
a
protection
against
german
submarines
it
brought
home
to
her
rather
the
thing
she
had
escaped
after
a
time
she
thought
of
food
but
rather
hopelessly
her
attempts
to
get
from
a
stupid
boy
had
produced
nothing
more
useful
than
a
flow
of
unintelligible
french
and
no
soap
whatever
she
tried
a
pantomime
of
washing
her
hands
but
to
the
boy
she
had
appeared
to
be
merely
wringing
them
and
as
a
great
many
females
were
wringing
their
hands
in
france
those
days
he
had
gone
away
rather
sorry
for
her
when
hunger
drove
her
to
the
bell
again
he
came
back
and
found
her
with
her
little
phrase
book
in
her
hands
feverishly
turning
the
pages
she
could
find
plenty
of
sentences
such
as
vous
avez
renversé
du
vin
sur
ma
but
not
an
egg
lifted
its
shining
pate
above
the
pages
not
cereal
not
fruit
not
even
the
word
breakfast
long
long
afterward
sara
lee
found
a
quite
delightful
breakfast
hidden
between
two
pages
that
were
stuck
together
but
it
was
then
far
too
late
began
sara
lee
and
turned
the
pages
rapidly
this
do
you
see
she
had
found
roast
beef
the
boy
observed
stolidly
in
french
that
it
was
not
ready
until
noon
she
was
able
to
make
out
from
his
failing
to
depart
that
there
was
no
roast
beef
good
gracious
she
said
ravenous
and
exasperated
go
and
get
me
some
bread
and
coffee
anyhow
she
repeated
it
slightly
louder
that
was
the
tableau
that
henri
found
when
after
a
custom
that
may
be
war
or
may
be
continental
he
had
inquired
the
number
of
her
room
and
made
his
way
there
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
blue
eyes
as
he
bowed
before
her
and
a
vast
relief
too
so
you
are
here
he
said
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
he
had
put
in
an
extremely
bad
night
even
for
him
by
whom
nights
were
seldom
wasted
in
a
bed
while
he
was
with
her
something
of
her
poise
had
communicated
itself
to
him
he
had
felt
the
confidence
in
men
and
affairs
that
american
girls
are
given
as
a
birthright
and
her
desire
for
service
he
had
understood
as
a
year
or
two
ago
he
could
not
have
understood
but
he
had
stood
by
the
rail
staring
north
and
cursing
himself
for
having
placed
her
in
danger
during
the
entire
crossing
there
was
nothing
about
him
that
morning
however
to
show
his
bad
hours
he
was
debonnaire
and
smiling
i
am
famishing
said
sara
lee
and
there
are
no
eggs
in
this
book
none
whatever
eggs
you
wish
eggs
i
just
want
food
almost
anything
will
do
i
asked
for
eggs
because
they
can
come
quickly
henri
turned
to
the
boy
and
sent
him
off
with
a
rapid
order
then
may
i
come
in
he
said
sara
lee
cast
an
uneasy
glance
over
the
room
it
was
extremely
tidy
and
unmistakably
it
was
a
bedroom
but
though
her
color
rose
she
asked
him
in
after
all
what
did
it
matter
to
have
refused
would
have
looked
priggish
she
said
to
herself
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
early
lessons
she
learned
in
france
was
learned
that
morning
that
though
convention
had
had
to
go
like
many
other
things
in
the
war
men
who
were
gentlemen
ignored
its
passing
henri
came
in
and
stood
by
the
center
table
now
please
tell
me
he
said
i
have
been
most
uneasy
on
the
quay
last
night
you
looked
frightened
i
was
awfully
frightened
nothing
happened
i
even
slept
you
were
very
brave
i
was
very
seasick
i
am
sorry
henri
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
but
said
sara
lee
slowly
i
i
ca
be
on
your
hands
you
know
you
must
have
many
things
to
do
if
you
are
going
to
have
to
order
my
meals
and
all
that
i
going
to
be
a
dreadful
burden
but
you
will
learn
very
quickly
i
stupid
about
languages
henri
dismissed
that
with
a
gesture
she
could
not
he
felt
be
stupid
about
anything
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
destroyers
were
still
coaling
and
a
small
cargo
was
being
taken
off
the
boat
at
the
quay
the
rain
was
over
and
in
the
early
sunlight
an
officer
in
blue
tunic
red
breeches
and
black
cavalry
boots
was
taking
the
air
his
head
bent
over
his
chest
not
a
detail
of
the
scene
escaped
him
i
have
agreed
to
find
the
right
place
for
you
he
said
thoughtfully
there
is
one
but
i
think
he
hesitated
i
do
not
wish
to
place
you
again
in
danger
you
mean
that
it
is
near
the
front
very
near
mademoiselle
but
i
should
be
rather
near
to
be
useful
perhaps
for
your
work
but
what
of
you
these
brutes
they
shell
far
and
wide
one
can
never
be
sure
he
paused
and
surveyed
her
whimsically
who
allowed
you
to
come
alone
like
this
he
demanded
is
there
no
one
who
objected
sara
lee
glanced
down
at
her
ring
the
man
i
am
going
to
marry
he
is
very
angry
henri
looked
at
her
and
followed
her
eyes
to
harvey
ring
he
said
nothing
however
but
he
went
over
and
gave
the
bell
cord
a
violent
jerk
you
must
have
food
quickly
he
said
in
a
rather
flat
voice
you
are
looking
tired
and
pale
a
sense
of
unreality
was
growing
on
sara
lee
that
she
should
be
alone
in
france
with
a
man
she
had
never
seen
three
days
before
that
she
knew
nothing
whatever
about
that
man
that
for
the
present
at
least
she
was
utterly
and
absolutely
dependent
on
him
even
for
the
food
she
ate
it
was
all
of
a
piece
with
the
night
voyage
and
the
little
room
at
the
savoy
and
it
was
none
of
it
real
when
the
breakfast
tray
came
henri
was
again
at
the
window
and
silent
and
sara
lee
saw
that
it
was
laid
for
two
she
was
a
little
startled
but
the
businesslike
way
in
which
the
young
officer
drew
up
two
chairs
and
held
one
out
for
her
made
protest
seem
absurd
and
the
boy
who
waited
looked
unshocked
and
uninterested
it
was
not
until
she
had
had
some
coffee
that
henri
followed
up
his
line
of
thought
so
the
fiance
did
not
approve
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
there
is
always
danger
for
there
are
german
aëroplanes
even
in
remote
places
and
you
are
very
young
you
still
wish
to
establish
yourself
mademoiselle
of
course
would
it
be
a
comfort
to
cable
your
safe
arrival
in
france
to
the
fiancé
when
he
saw
her
face
he
smiled
and
if
it
was
a
rather
heroic
smile
it
was
none
the
less
friendly
i
see
what
shall
i
say
or
will
you
write
it
so
sara
lee
vastly
cheered
by
two
cups
of
coffee
an
egg
and
a
very
considerable
portion
of
bread
and
butter
wrote
her
cable
it
was
to
be
brief
for
cables
cost
money
it
said
safe
well
love
and
henri
who
seemed
to
have
strange
and
ominous
powers
sent
it
almost
immediately
total
cost
as
reported
to
sara
lee
two
francs
he
took
the
money
she
offered
him
gravely
we
shall
cable
quite
often
he
said
he
will
be
anxious
and
i
think
he
has
a
right
to
know
the
we
was
entirely
unconscious
and
now
he
said
when
he
had
gravely
allowed
sara
lee
to
pay
her
half
of
the
breakfast
we
must
arrange
to
get
you
out
of
calais
and
that
mademoiselle
may
take
time
it
took
time
sara
lee
growing
accustomed
now
to
little
rooms
entirely
filled
with
men
and
typewriters
went
from
one
office
to
another
walking
along
the
narrow
pavements
with
henri
through
streets
filled
with
soldiers
once
they
drew
aside
to
let
pass
a
procession
of
belgian
refugees
those
who
had
held
to
their
village
homes
until
bombardment
had
destroyed
them
stout
peasant
women
in
short
skirts
and
with
huge
bundles
old
men
a
few
young
ones
many
children
the
terror
of
the
early
flight
was
not
theirs
but
there
was
in
all
of
them
a
sort
of
sodden
hopelessness
that
cut
sara
lee
to
the
heart
in
an
irregular
column
they
walked
along
staring
ahead
but
seeing
nothing
even
the
children
looked
old
and
tired
sara
lee
eyes
filled
with
tears
my
people
said
henri
simple
country
folk
and
going
to
england
where
they
will
grieve
for
the
things
that
are
gone
their
fields
and
their
sons
the
old
ones
will
die
quickly
of
homesickness
it
is
difficult
to
transplant
an
old
tree
the
final
formalities
seemed
to
offer
certain
difficulties
henri
who
liked
to
do
things
quickly
and
like
a
prince
flushed
with
irritation
he
drew
himself
up
rather
haughtily
in
reply
to
one
question
and
glanced
uneasily
at
the
girl
but
it
was
all
as
intelligible
as
sanskrit
to
her
it
was
only
after
a
whispered
sentence
to
the
man
at
the
head
of
the
table
that
the
paper
was
finally
signed
as
they
went
down
to
the
street
together
sara
lee
made
a
little
protest
but
i
simply
must
not
take
all
your
time
she
said
looking
up
anxiously
i
begin
to
realize
how
foolhardy
the
whole
thing
is
i
meant
well
but
it
is
you
who
are
doing
everything
not
i
i
shall
not
make
the
soup
mademoiselle
he
replied
gravely
viii
here
were
more
things
to
do
sara
lee
money
must
be
exchanged
at
a
bank
for
french
gold
she
had
three
hundred
dollars
and
it
had
been
given
her
in
a
tiny
brown
canvas
bag
and
then
there
was
the
matter
of
going
from
calais
toward
the
front
she
had
expected
to
find
a
train
but
there
were
no
trains
all
cars
were
being
used
for
troops
she
stared
at
henri
in
blank
dismay
no
trains
she
said
blankly
would
an
automobile
be
very
expensive
they
are
all
under
government
control
mademoiselle
even
the
petrol
she
stopped
in
the
street
then
i
shall
have
to
go
back
henri
laughed
boyishly
mademoiselle
he
said
i
have
been
requested
to
take
you
to
a
place
where
you
may
render
us
the
service
we
so
badly
need
for
the
present
that
is
my
duty
and
nothing
else
so
if
you
will
accept
the
offer
of
my
car
which
is
a
shameful
one
but
travels
well
we
can
continue
our
journey
long
long
afterward
sara
lee
found
a
snapshot
of
henri
car
taken
by
a
british
officer
found
it
and
sat
for
a
long
time
with
it
in
her
hand
thinking
and
remembering
that
first
day
she
saw
it
in
the
sun
at
calais
a
long
low
car
it
was
once
green
but
now
roughly
painted
gray
but
it
was
not
the
crude
painting
significant
as
it
was
that
brought
so
close
the
thing
she
was
going
to
it
was
that
the
car
was
but
a
shell
of
a
car
the
mud
guards
were
crumpled
up
against
the
side
body
and
hood
were
pitted
with
shrapnel
a
door
had
been
shot
away
and
the
wind
shield
was
but
a
frame
set
round
with
broken
glass
even
the
wore
a
patch
over
one
eye
and
his
uniform
was
ragged
not
a
beautiful
car
mademoiselle
as
i
warned
you
but
a
fast
one
henri
was
having
a
double
enjoyment
he
was
watching
sara
lee
face
and
his
chauffeur
remaining
eye
but
fast
eh
jean
he
said
to
the
chauffeur
the
man
nodded
and
said
something
in
french
it
was
probably
the
thing
henri
had
hoped
for
and
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
jean
is
reminding
me
he
said
gayly
that
it
is
forbidden
to
officers
to
take
a
lady
along
the
road
that
we
shall
travel
but
when
he
saw
how
sara
lee
flushed
he
turned
to
the
man
mademoiselle
has
come
from
america
to
help
us
jean
he
said
quietly
and
now
for
dunkirk
the
road
from
dunkirk
to
calais
was
well
guarded
in
those
days
from
nieuport
for
some
miles
inland
only
the
shattered
remnant
of
the
belgian
army
held
the
line
for
the
cry
on
to
paris
the
germans
had
substituted
on
to
calais
so
on
french
soil
at
least
the
road
was
well
guarded
a
few
miles
in
the
battered
car
then
a
slowing
up
a
showing
of
passports
the
clatter
of
a
great
chain
as
it
dropped
to
the
road
a
lowering
of
leveled
rifles
and
a
salute
from
the
officer
that
was
the
method
by
which
they
advanced
henri
sat
with
the
driver
and
talked
in
a
low
tone
sometimes
he
sat
quiet
looking
ahead
he
seemed
somehow
older
more
careworn
his
boyishness
had
gone
now
and
then
he
turned
to
ask
if
she
was
comfortable
but
in
the
intervals
she
felt
that
he
had
entirely
forgotten
her
once
at
something
jean
said
he
got
out
a
pocket
map
and
went
over
it
carefully
it
was
a
long
time
after
that
before
he
turned
to
see
if
she
was
all
right
sara
lee
sat
forward
and
watched
everything
she
saw
little
evidence
of
war
beyond
the
occasional
sentries
and
chains
women
were
walking
along
the
roads
children
stopped
and
pointed
smiling
at
the
battered
car
one
very
small
boy
saluted
and
henri
as
gravely
returned
the
salute
some
time
after
that
he
turned
to
her
i
find
that
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
in
dunkirk
he
said
a
matter
of
a
day
only
probably
but
i
will
see
before
i
go
that
you
are
comfortable
i
shall
be
quite
all
right
of
course
but
something
had
gone
out
of
the
day
for
her
sara
lee
learned
one
thing
that
day
learned
it
as
some
women
do
learn
by
the
glance
of
an
eye
the
tone
of
a
voice
the
chauffeur
adored
henri
his
one
unbandaged
eye
stole
moments
from
the
road
to
glance
at
him
when
he
spoke
while
henri
read
his
map
his
very
voice
betrayed
him
and
while
she
pondered
the
thing
they
drew
into
the
square
of
dunkirk
where
the
statue
of
jean
bart
pirate
and
privateer
stared
down
at
this
new
procession
of
war
which
passed
daily
and
nightly
under
his
cold
eyes
jean
and
a
porter
carried
in
her
luggage
henri
and
a
voluble
and
smiling
frenchwoman
showed
her
to
her
room
she
felt
like
an
island
of
silence
in
a
sea
of
french
the
frenchwoman
threw
open
the
door
a
great
room
with
high
curtained
windows
a
huge
bed
with
a
faded
gilt
canopy
and
heavy
draperies
a
wardrobe
as
vast
as
the
bed
and
for
a
toilet
table
an
enormous
mirror
reaching
to
the
ceiling
and
with
a
marble
shelf
below
that
was
her
room
i
think
you
will
be
comfortable
here
mademoiselle
sara
lee
who
still
clutched
her
small
bag
of
gold
shook
her
head
comfortable
yes
she
said
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
very
expensive
henri
named
an
extremely
low
figure
an
exact
fourth
to
be
accurate
of
its
real
cost
a
surprising
person
henri
with
his
worn
uniform
and
his
capacity
for
kindly
mendacity
and
seeing
something
in
the
frenchwoman
face
that
perhaps
he
had
expected
he
turned
to
her
almost
fiercely
you
are
to
understand
madame
that
this
lady
has
been
placed
in
my
care
by
authority
that
will
not
be
questioned
she
is
to
have
every
deference
that
was
all
but
was
enough
and
from
that
time
on
sara
lee
kennedy
of
ohio
was
called
in
the
tiny
box
downstairs
which
constituted
the
office
mademoiselle
la
princesse
henri
did
a
characteristic
and
kindly
thing
for
sara
lee
before
he
left
that
evening
on
one
of
the
many
mysterious
journeys
that
he
was
to
make
during
the
time
sara
lee
knew
him
he
came
to
her
door
menus
in
hand
and
painstakingly
ordered
for
her
a
dinner
for
that
night
and
the
three
meals
for
the
day
following
he
made
no
suggestion
of
dining
with
her
that
evening
indeed
watching
him
from
her
small
table
sara
lee
decided
that
he
had
put
her
entirely
out
of
his
mind
he
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
her
save
the
cashier
at
her
desk
and
money
drawer
she
was
the
only
woman
in
that
room
full
of
officers
quite
certainly
henri
was
the
only
man
who
did
not
find
some
excuse
for
glancing
in
her
direction
but
finishing
early
he
paused
by
the
cashier
desk
to
pay
for
his
meal
and
then
he
gave
sara
lee
the
stiffest
and
most
ceremonious
of
bows
she
felt
hurt
alone
in
her
great
room
the
curtains
drawn
by
order
of
the
police
lest
a
ray
of
light
betray
the
town
to
eyes
in
the
air
she
went
carefully
over
the
hours
she
had
spent
with
henri
that
day
looking
for
a
cause
of
offense
she
must
have
hurt
him
or
he
would
surely
have
stopped
to
speak
to
her
perhaps
already
he
was
finding
her
a
burden
she
flushed
with
shame
when
she
remembered
about
the
meals
he
had
had
to
order
for
her
and
she
sat
up
in
her
great
bed
until
late
studying
by
candlelight
such
phrases
as
y
a
une
erreur
dans
la
and
quels
fruits
she
tried
to
write
to
harvey
that
night
but
she
gave
it
up
at
last
there
was
too
much
he
would
not
understand
she
could
not
write
frankly
without
telling
of
henri
and
to
this
point
everything
had
centered
about
henri
it
all
rather
worried
her
because
there
was
nothing
she
was
ashamed
of
nothing
she
should
have
had
to
conceal
she
had
yet
to
learn
had
sara
lee
that
many
of
the
concealments
of
life
are
based
not
on
wrongdoing
but
on
fear
of
misunderstanding
so
she
got
as
far
as
i
am
here
in
a
hotel
at
dunkirk
and
then
stopped
fairly
engulfed
in
a
wave
of
homesickness
not
so
much
for
harvey
as
for
familiar
things
uncle
james
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
with
the
phonograph
playing
my
little
gray
home
in
the
west
her
own
white
bedroom
the
sun
on
the
red
geraniums
in
the
window
the
voices
of
happy
children
wandering
home
from
school
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
first
blowing
out
the
candle
outside
the
town
lay
asleep
and
from
a
gate
in
the
old
wall
a
sentry
with
a
bugle
blew
a
quiet
all
well
from
somewhere
near
on
top
of
the
perhaps
where
eyes
all
night
searched
the
sky
for
danger
came
the
same
trumpet
call
of
safety
for
the
time
of
a
little
longer
for
quiet
sleep
for
two
days
the
girl
was
alone
there
was
no
sign
of
henri
she
had
nothing
to
read
and
her
eyes
watching
hour
after
hour
the
panorama
that
passed
through
the
square
under
her
window
searched
vainly
for
his
battered
gray
car
in
daytime
the
panorama
was
chiefly
of
motor
lorries
she
called
them
trucks
piled
high
with
supplies
often
fodder
for
the
horses
in
that
vague
district
beyond
ammunition
and
food
now
and
then
a
battery
rumbled
through
its
gunners
on
the
limbers
detached
with
folded
arms
and
always
there
were
soldiers
sometimes
from
her
window
she
saw
the
market
people
below
in
their
striped
booths
staring
up
at
the
sky
she
would
look
up
too
and
there
would
be
an
aëroplane
sliding
along
sometimes
so
low
that
one
could
hear
the
faint
report
of
the
exhaust
but
it
was
the
ambulances
that
sara
lee
looked
for
mostly
they
came
at
night
a
steady
stream
of
them
sometimes
they
moved
rapidly
again
one
would
be
going
very
slowly
and
other
machines
would
circle
impatiently
round
it
and
go
on
a
silent
grim
procession
in
the
moonlight
it
was
and
it
helped
the
girl
to
bear
the
solitude
of
those
two
interminable
days
inside
those
long
gray
cars
with
the
red
crosses
painted
on
the
tops
a
symbol
of
mercy
that
had
ceased
to
protect
inside
those
cars
were
wounded
men
men
who
had
perhaps
lain
for
hours
without
food
or
care
surely
surely
it
was
right
that
she
had
come
the
little
she
could
do
must
count
in
the
great
total
she
twisted
harvey
ring
on
her
finger
and
sent
a
little
message
to
him
you
will
forgive
me
when
you
know
dear
was
the
message
it
is
so
terrible
so
pitiful
yet
during
the
day
the
square
was
gay
enough
officers
in
spurs
clanked
across
wide
capes
blowing
in
the
wind
common
soldiers
bought
fruit
and
paper
bags
of
fried
potatoes
from
the
booths
countless
dogs
fought
under
the
feet
of
and
over
all
leered
the
sardonic
face
of
jean
bart
pirate
and
privateer
sara
lee
went
out
daily
but
never
far
and
she
practiced
french
with
the
maid
after
this
fashion
de
said
the
smiling
maid
putting
the
linen
sheets
on
the
bed
sara
lee
would
repeat
it
some
six
times
when
the
pillows
came
so
sara
lee
called
pillows
by
the
name
of
their
slips
from
that
time
forward
came
a
bright
hour
when
she
rang
the
bell
for
the
boy
and
asked
for
matches
which
she
certainly
did
not
need
with
entire
success
on
the
second
night
sara
lee
slept
badly
at
two
she
heard
a
sound
in
the
hall
and
putting
on
her
kimono
opened
the
door
on
a
stiff
chair
outside
snoring
profoundly
sat
jean
fully
dressed
the
light
from
her
candle
roused
him
and
he
was
wide
awake
in
an
instant
why
jean
she
said
is
there
any
place
for
you
to
sleep
i
am
to
remain
here
mademoiselle
he
replied
in
english
but
surely
not
because
of
me
it
is
the
captain
order
he
said
briefly
i
do
understand
why
all
sorts
of
people
come
to
this
place
mademoiselle
but
few
ladies
it
is
best
that
i
remain
here
she
could
not
move
him
he
had
remained
standing
while
she
spoke
to
him
and
now
he
yawned
striving
to
conceal
it
sara
lee
felt
very
uncomfortable
but
jean
attitude
and
voice
alike
were
firm
she
thanked
him
and
said
good
night
but
she
slept
little
after
that
lying
there
in
the
darkness
a
warm
glow
of
gratitude
to
henri
and
a
feeling
of
her
safety
in
his
care
wrapped
her
like
a
mantle
she
wondered
drowsily
if
harvey
would
ever
have
thought
of
all
the
small
things
that
seemed
second
nature
to
this
young
belgian
officer
she
rather
thought
not
ix
while
she
was
breakfasting
the
next
morning
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
thinking
it
the
maid
she
called
to
her
to
come
in
but
it
was
jean
an
anxious
jean
twisting
his
cap
in
his
hands
you
have
had
a
message
from
the
captain
mademoiselle
no
jean
he
was
to
have
returned
during
the
night
he
has
not
come
mademoiselle
sara
lee
forgot
her
morning
negligée
in
jean
harassed
face
but
where
did
he
go
jean
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
did
not
reply
are
you
worried
about
him
i
am
anxious
mademoiselle
but
i
am
often
anxious
and
he
always
returns
he
smiled
almost
sheepishly
sara
lee
who
had
no
subtlety
but
a
great
deal
of
intuition
felt
that
there
was
a
certain
relief
in
the
smile
as
though
jean
having
had
no
message
from
his
master
was
pleased
that
she
had
none
which
was
true
enough
at
that
also
she
felt
that
one
eye
was
inspecting
her
closely
which
was
also
true
a
new
factor
had
come
into
henri
life
by
jean
reasoning
a
new
and
dangerous
one
and
there
were
dangers
enough
already
highly
dangerous
jean
reflected
in
the
back
of
his
head
as
he
backed
out
with
a
bow
a
young
girl
unafraid
of
the
morning
sun
and
sitting
at
a
little
breakfast
table
as
fresh
as
herself
that
was
a
picture
for
a
man
jean
forgot
for
a
moment
his
anxiety
for
henri
safety
in
his
fear
for
his
peace
of
mind
for
a
doubt
had
been
removed
the
girl
was
straight
jean
one
sophisticated
eye
had
grasped
that
at
once
a
good
girl
alone
and
far
from
home
and
henri
like
all
soldiers
for
good
women
for
unpainted
skins
and
clear
eyes
and
the
freshness
and
bloom
of
youth
all
there
behind
that
little
breakfast
table
which
might
so
pleasantly
have
been
laid
for
two
jean
took
a
walk
that
morning
and
stood
staring
for
twenty
minutes
into
a
clock
maker
window
full
of
clocks
after
which
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
the
time
at
two
in
the
afternoon
sara
lee
saw
henri
car
come
into
the
square
it
was
if
possible
more
dilapidated
than
before
and
he
came
like
a
gray
whirlwind
scattering
people
and
dogs
out
of
his
way
almost
before
he
had
had
time
to
enter
the
hotel
sara
lee
heard
him
in
the
hall
and
the
next
moment
he
was
bowing
before
her
i
have
been
longer
than
i
expected
he
explained
have
you
been
quite
comfortable
sara
lee
however
was
gazing
at
him
with
startled
eyes
he
was
dirty
unshaven
and
his
eyes
looked
hollow
and
bloodshot
from
his
neck
to
his
heels
he
was
smeared
with
mud
and
his
tidy
tunic
was
torn
into
ragged
holes
but
you
you
have
been
fighting
she
gasped
i
no
mademoiselle
there
has
been
no
battle
his
eyes
left
her
and
traveled
over
the
room
they
are
doing
everything
for
you
they
are
attentive
everything
is
splendid
said
sara
lee
if
you
wo
tell
me
how
you
got
into
that
condition
at
least
you
can
send
your
coat
down
to
me
to
mend
my
tunic
he
looked
at
it
smilingly
you
would
do
that
i
am
nearly
frantic
for
something
to
do
he
smiled
and
suddenly
bending
down
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
you
are
not
only
very
beautiful
mademoiselle
but
you
are
very
good
he
went
away
then
and
sara
lee
got
out
her
sewing
things
the
tunic
came
soon
carefully
brushed
and
very
ragged
but
it
was
not
jean
who
brought
it
it
was
the
flemish
boy
and
upstairs
in
a
small
room
with
two
beds
sara
lee
might
have
been
surprised
to
find
jean
the
chauffeur
lying
on
one
while
henri
shaved
himself
beside
the
other
for
jean
of
the
ragged
uniform
and
the
patch
over
one
eye
was
a
count
of
belgium
and
served
henri
because
he
loved
him
and
because
too
he
was
no
longer
useful
in
that
little
army
where
lay
his
heart
sometime
a
book
will
be
written
about
the
jeans
of
this
war
the
great
friendships
it
has
brought
forth
between
men
and
not
the
least
of
its
stories
will
be
that
of
this
jean
of
the
one
eye
but
its
place
is
not
here
and
perhaps
there
will
be
a
book
about
the
henris
also
but
not
for
a
long
time
and
even
then
with
care
for
the
heroes
of
one
department
of
an
army
in
the
field
live
and
die
unsung
their
bravest
exploits
are
buried
in
secrecy
and
that
is
as
it
must
be
but
it
is
a
fine
tale
to
go
untold
after
he
had
bathed
and
shaved
henri
sat
down
at
a
tiny
table
and
wrote
he
drew
a
plan
also
from
a
rough
one
before
him
then
he
took
a
match
and
burned
the
original
drawing
until
it
was
but
charred
black
ashes
when
he
had
finished
jean
got
up
from
the
bed
and
put
on
his
overcoat
to
the
king
he
said
to
the
king
old
friend
jean
took
the
letter
and
went
out
down
below
sara
lee
sat
with
henri
ragged
tunic
on
her
lap
and
stitched
carefully
sometime
she
reflected
she
would
be
mending
worn
garments
for
another
man
now
far
away
a
little
flood
of
tenderness
came
over
her
so
helpless
these
men
there
was
so
much
to
do
for
them
and
soon
please
god
she
would
be
helping
other
tired
and
weary
men
with
food
and
perhaps
a
word
when
she
had
acquired
some
french
and
perhaps
a
thread
and
needle
she
dined
alone
that
night
as
usual
henri
did
not
appear
though
she
had
sent
what
she
suspected
was
his
only
tunic
back
to
him
neatly
mended
at
five
as
a
matter
of
fact
henri
was
sound
asleep
he
had
meant
to
rest
only
for
an
hour
a
body
that
was
crying
aloud
with
fatigue
but
jean
coming
in
quietly
had
found
him
sleeping
like
a
child
and
had
put
his
own
blanket
over
him
and
left
him
henri
slept
until
morning
when
jean
coming
up
from
his
vigil
outside
the
american
girl
door
found
him
waking
and
rested
and
rang
for
coffee
jean
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
put
on
his
shoes
and
puttees
he
was
a
taciturn
man
but
now
he
had
something
to
say
that
he
did
not
like
to
say
and
henri
knew
it
what
is
it
he
asked
his
arms
under
his
head
come
let
us
have
it
it
is
of
course
about
the
american
lady
it
is
jean
said
bluntly
you
can
not
mix
women
and
war
and
you
think
i
am
doing
that
i
am
not
an
idiot
jean
growled
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
doing
i
do
she
is
young
and
lonely
you
are
young
and
not
unattractive
to
women
already
she
turns
pale
when
i
so
much
as
ask
if
she
has
heard
from
you
you
asked
her
that
you
were
gone
much
longer
than
and
you
thought
i
might
send
her
word
and
not
you
henri
voice
was
offended
he
lay
back
while
the
boy
brought
in
the
morning
coffee
and
rolls
let
me
tell
you
something
he
said
when
the
boy
had
gone
she
is
betrothed
to
an
american
she
wears
a
betrothal
ring
i
am
to
her
the
french
language
but
though
henri
laughed
jean
remained
grave
and
brooding
for
henri
had
not
said
what
sara
lee
already
was
to
him
it
was
later
in
the
morning
that
henri
broached
the
subject
again
they
were
in
the
courtyard
of
an
old
house
working
over
the
engine
of
the
car
i
think
i
have
found
a
location
for
the
young
american
lady
he
said
jean
hammered
for
a
considerable
time
at
a
refractory
rim
and
where
he
asked
at
last
henri
named
the
little
town
like
henri
family
name
it
must
not
be
told
too
many
things
happened
there
and
perhaps
it
is
even
now
headquarters
for
that
portion
of
the
line
has
changed
very
little
jean
fell
to
renewed
hammering
if
you
will
be
silent
i
shall
explain
a
plan
henri
said
in
a
cautious
tone
she
will
make
soup
with
help
which
we
shall
find
and
if
coming
in
for
refreshments
a
soldier
shall
leave
a
letter
for
me
it
is
natural
is
it
not
she
will
suspect
of
course
i
think
not
and
she
reads
no
french
none
whatever
yet
jean
suspicions
were
not
entirely
allayed
the
plan
had
its
advantages
it
was
important
that
henri
receive
certain
reports
and
already
the
hotel
whispered
that
henri
was
of
the
secret
service
it
brought
him
added
deference
of
course
but
additional
danger
so
jean
accepted
the
plan
but
with
reservation
and
it
was
not
long
afterward
that
he
said
to
sara
lee
in
french
there
is
a
spider
on
your
neck
mademoiselle
but
sara
lee
only
said
i
sorry
jean
you
have
to
speak
english
to
me
for
a
while
i
afraid
and
though
he
watched
her
for
five
minutes
she
did
not
put
her
hand
to
her
neck
however
that
was
later
on
that
afternoon
henri
spent
an
hour
with
the
minister
of
war
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
said
thank
you
baron
i
think
you
will
not
regret
it
america
must
learn
the
truth
and
how
better
than
through
those
friendly
people
who
come
to
us
to
help
it
is
as
well
to
state
however
that
he
left
the
minister
of
war
with
the
undoubted
impression
that
miss
sara
lee
kennedy
was
a
spinster
of
uncertain
years
sara
lee
packed
her
own
suitcase
that
afternoon
doing
it
rather
nervously
because
henri
was
standing
in
the
room
by
the
window
waiting
for
it
he
had
come
in
as
as
harvey
had
entered
the
parlor
at
aunt
harriet
except
that
he
carried
in
his
arms
some
six
towels
a
cake
of
soap
and
what
looked
suspiciously
like
two
sheets
the
house
i
have
under
consideration
he
said
has
little
to
recommend
it
but
the
building
and
even
that
the
occupants
have
gone
away
and
you
are
not
a
soldier
sara
lee
eyed
the
bundle
i
do
need
sheets
she
expostulated
there
are
but
two
and
jean
has
placed
blankets
in
the
car
you
must
have
a
pillow
also
he
calmly
took
one
of
the
hotel
pillows
from
the
bed
what
else
he
asked
calmly
cigarettes
but
no
you
do
not
smoke
sara
lee
eyed
him
with
something
very
like
despair
are
you
ever
going
to
let
me
think
for
myself
would
you
have
thought
of
these
he
demanded
triumphantly
you
you
think
only
of
soup
and
tired
soldiers
some
one
must
think
of
you
and
there
was
a
touch
of
tenderness
in
his
voice
sara
lee
felt
it
and
trembled
slightly
he
was
so
fine
and
he
must
not
think
of
her
that
way
it
was
not
real
it
could
be
men
were
lonely
here
where
everything
was
hard
and
cruel
they
wanted
some
of
the
softness
of
life
and
all
of
kindness
and
sweetness
that
she
could
give
should
be
henri
but
she
must
make
it
clear
that
there
could
never
be
anything
more
there
was
a
tightness
about
her
mouth
as
she
folded
the
white
frock
i
know
that
garment
he
said
boyishly
do
you
remember
the
night
you
wore
it
and
how
we
wandered
in
the
square
and
made
the
plan
that
has
brought
us
together
again
sara
lee
reached
down
into
her
suitcase
and
brought
up
harvey
picture
i
would
like
you
to
see
this
she
said
a
little
breathlessly
it
is
the
man
i
am
to
marry
for
a
moment
she
thought
henri
was
not
going
to
take
it
but
he
came
rather
slowly
and
held
out
his
hand
for
it
he
went
with
it
to
the
window
and
stood
there
for
some
time
looking
down
at
it
when
are
you
going
to
marry
him
mademoiselle
as
soon
as
i
go
back
sara
lee
had
expected
some
other
comment
but
he
made
none
he
put
the
photograph
very
quietly
on
the
bed
before
her
and
gathered
up
the
linen
and
the
pillow
in
his
arms
i
shall
send
for
your
luggage
mademoiselle
and
you
will
find
me
at
the
car
outside
waiting
and
so
it
was
that
a
very
silent
henri
sat
with
jean
going
out
to
that
strange
land
which
was
to
be
sara
lee
home
for
many
months
and
a
very
silent
sara
lee
flanked
with
pillow
and
blankets
who
sat
back
alone
and
tried
to
recall
the
tones
of
harvey
voice
and
failed
x
from
dunkirk
to
the
front
the
road
after
the
belgian
line
was
passed
was
lightly
guarded
henri
came
out
of
a
reverie
to
explain
to
sara
lee
we
have
not
many
men
he
said
and
those
that
remain
are
holding
the
line
it
is
very
weary
our
army
now
at
home
uncle
james
had
thought
very
highly
of
the
belgian
army
he
had
watched
the
fight
they
made
and
he
had
tried
to
interest
sara
lee
in
it
but
without
much
result
she
had
generally
said
is
it
wonderful
or
horrible
as
the
case
might
be
and
put
out
of
her
mind
as
soon
as
possible
the
ringing
words
he
had
been
reading
but
she
had
not
forgotten
she
found
they
came
back
to
her
as
she
rode
through
that
deserted
countryside
henri
glancing
back
somewhat
later
found
her
in
tears
he
climbed
back
at
once
into
the
rear
of
the
car
and
sat
down
beside
her
you
are
homesick
i
think
yes
but
not
for
myself
i
am
just
homesick
for
all
the
people
who
have
lost
their
homes
you
and
jean
and
all
the
rest
some
day
i
shall
tell
you
about
my
home
and
what
has
happened
to
it
he
said
gravely
not
now
it
is
not
pleasant
but
you
must
remember
this
we
are
going
back
home
we
belgians
and
after
a
little
pause
just
as
you
are
he
lapsed
into
silence
after
that
and
sara
lee
stealing
a
glance
at
him
saw
his
face
set
and
hard
she
had
a
purely
maternal
impulse
to
reach
over
and
pat
his
hand
jean
did
not
like
henri
shift
to
the
rear
of
the
car
he
drove
with
a
sort
of
irritable
feverishness
until
henri
leaned
over
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
we
have
mademoiselle
with
us
jean
he
said
in
french
it
is
not
difficult
to
believe
growled
jean
but
he
slackened
his
pace
somewhat
so
far
the
road
had
been
deserted
now
they
had
come
up
to
a
stream
of
traffic
flowing
slowly
toward
the
front
armored
cars
looking
tall
and
rumbled
and
jolted
along
many
lorries
one
limousine
containing
a
general
a
few
paris
buses
all
smeared
a
dingy
gray
and
filled
with
french
soldiers
numberless
and
nondescript
open
machines
here
and
there
a
vehicle
these
filled
the
road
in
and
out
among
them
jean
threaded
his
way
while
sara
lee
grew
crimson
with
the
effort
to
see
it
all
and
henri
sat
very
stiff
and
silent
at
a
crossroads
they
were
halted
by
troops
who
had
fallen
out
for
a
rest
the
men
stood
at
ease
and
stared
their
fill
at
sara
lee
save
for
a
few
weary
peasants
most
of
them
had
seen
no
women
for
months
but
they
were
respectful
if
openly
admiring
and
their
admiration
of
her
was
nothing
to
sara
lee
feeling
toward
them
she
loved
them
all
boys
with
their
first
straggly
beards
on
their
chins
older
men
looking
worn
and
tired
french
and
belgian
smiling
and
sad
but
most
of
all
for
uncle
james
sake
she
loved
the
belgians
i
can
not
tell
you
she
said
breathlessly
to
henri
it
is
like
a
dream
come
true
and
i
shall
help
you
look
doubtful
sometimes
but
i
am
sure
you
are
heaven
sent
henri
replied
gravely
they
turned
into
a
crossroad
after
a
time
and
there
in
a
little
village
sara
lee
found
her
new
home
a
strange
village
indeed
unoccupied
and
largely
destroyed
piles
of
bricks
and
plaster
lined
the
streets
broken
glass
was
everywhere
jean
blew
out
a
tire
finally
because
of
the
glass
and
they
were
obliged
to
walk
the
remainder
of
the
way
a
poor
place
mademoiselle
henri
said
as
they
went
along
a
peaceful
little
town
and
quite
beautiful
once
and
it
harbored
no
troops
but
everything
is
meat
for
the
mouths
of
their
guns
sara
lee
stopped
and
looked
about
her
her
heart
was
beating
fast
but
her
lips
were
steady
enough
and
it
is
here
that
i
a
little
distance
down
the
street
you
must
see
before
you
decide
steady
passionless
firing
was
going
on
not
near
but
far
away
like
low
thunder
before
a
summer
storm
she
was
for
months
to
live
to
eat
and
sleep
and
dream
to
that
rumbling
from
the
ypres
salient
to
waken
when
it
ceased
or
to
look
up
from
her
work
at
the
strange
silence
but
it
was
new
to
her
then
and
terrible
do
they
still
shell
this
this
town
she
asked
rather
breathlessly
not
now
they
have
done
their
work
of
course
he
did
not
finish
sara
lee
heart
slowed
down
somewhat
after
all
she
had
asked
to
be
near
the
front
and
that
meant
guns
and
such
destruction
as
was
all
about
her
only
one
thing
troubled
her
it
is
rather
far
from
the
trenches
is
it
he
smiled
slightly
far
it
is
not
very
far
not
so
far
as
i
would
wish
mademoiselle
but
to
do
what
you
desire
it
is
the
best
i
have
to
offer
how
far
away
are
the
trenches
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
those
poplar
trees
he
indicated
on
a
slight
rise
a
row
of
great
trees
broken
somewhat
but
not
yet
reduced
to
the
twisted
skeletons
they
were
to
become
later
on
in
a
long
line
they
faced
the
enemy
like
sentinels
but
dauntless
and
behind
them
lay
the
wreck
of
the
little
village
quiet
and
empty
will
the
men
know
i
am
here
sara
lee
asked
anxiously
but
yes
mademoiselle
at
night
they
come
up
from
the
trenches
and
fresh
troops
take
their
places
they
come
up
this
street
and
go
on
to
wherever
they
are
to
rest
and
when
they
find
that
a
house
of
mercy
is
here
and
soup
they
will
come
more
than
you
wish
belgian
soldiers
only
belgian
soldiers
that
is
as
you
want
it
to
be
i
think
if
only
i
spoke
french
you
will
learn
and
in
the
meantime
mademoiselle
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
finding
you
a
servant
a
young
peasant
woman
and
you
will
also
have
a
soldier
always
on
guard
something
that
had
been
in
the
back
of
sara
lee
mind
for
some
time
suddenly
went
away
she
had
been
thinking
of
aunt
harriet
and
the
aid
society
of
the
methodist
church
she
had
in
fact
been
wondering
how
they
would
feel
when
they
learned
that
she
was
living
alone
the
only
woman
among
thousands
of
men
it
had
oddly
enough
never
occurred
to
her
before
you
have
thought
of
everything
she
said
gratefully
but
henri
said
nothing
he
had
indeed
thought
of
everything
with
a
vengeance
with
the
net
result
that
he
was
not
looking
at
sara
lee
more
than
he
could
help
these
americans
were
strange
an
american
girl
would
cross
the
seas
and
come
here
alone
with
him
a
man
and
human
and
she
would
take
for
granted
that
he
would
do
what
he
was
doing
for
love
of
his
kind
which
was
partly
true
and
she
would
be
beautiful
and
sweet
and
amiable
and
quite
and
then
she
would
go
back
home
warm
of
heart
with
gratitude
and
marry
the
man
of
the
picture
the
village
had
but
one
street
and
that
deserted
and
in
ruins
behind
its
double
row
of
houses
away
from
the
enemy
lay
the
fields
a
muddy
canal
and
more
poplar
trees
and
from
far
away
toward
ypres
there
came
constantly
that
somewhat
casual
booming
of
artillery
which
marked
the
first
winter
of
the
war
the
sound
of
the
guns
had
first
alarmed
then
interested
sara
lee
it
was
detached
then
far
away
it
meant
little
to
her
it
was
only
later
when
she
saw
some
of
the
results
of
the
sounds
she
heard
that
they
became
significant
but
this
is
not
a
tale
of
the
wounding
of
men
there
are
many
such
this
is
the
story
of
a
little
house
of
mercy
and
of
a
girl
with
a
dauntless
spirit
and
of
two
men
who
loved
her
only
that
the
maid
henri
had
found
was
already
in
the
house
sweeping
henri
presented
her
to
sara
lee
and
he
also
brought
a
smiling
little
belgian
boy
in
uniform
and
with
a
rifle
your
staff
mademoiselle
he
said
and
your
residence
sara
lee
looked
about
her
with
the
trifling
exception
that
there
was
no
roof
it
was
whole
and
the
roof
was
not
necessary
for
the
floors
of
the
upper
story
served
instead
there
was
a
narrow
passage
with
a
room
on
either
side
and
a
tiny
kitchen
behind
henri
threw
open
a
door
on
the
right
your
bedroom
he
said
well
furnished
as
you
will
see
it
should
be
since
there
has
been
brought
here
all
the
furniture
not
destroyed
in
the
village
his
blacker
mood
had
fallen
away
before
her
naive
delight
he
went
about
smiling
boyishly
showing
her
the
kettles
in
the
kitchen
the
supply
already
so
rare
of
firewood
the
little
stove
but
he
stiffened
somewhat
when
she
placed
her
hand
rather
timidly
on
his
arm
how
am
i
ever
to
thank
you
she
asked
by
doing
much
good
and
by
never
going
beyond
the
poplar
trees
she
promised
both
very
earnestly
but
she
was
a
little
sad
as
she
followed
henri
about
he
volubly
expatiating
on
such
advantages
as
plenty
of
air
owing
to
the
absence
of
a
roof
and
the
attraction
of
the
stove
which
he
showed
much
like
a
salesman
anxious
to
make
a
sale
such
a
stove
he
finished
contentedly
it
will
make
soup
even
in
your
absence
mademoiselle
our
peasants
eat
much
soup
therefore
it
is
what
you
would
call
a
trained
stove
before
sara
lee
eyes
came
a
picture
of
harvey
and
the
leete
house
its
white
dining
room
its
bay
window
for
plants
its
comfortable
charm
and
prettiness
and
harvey
face
as
he
planned
it
for
her
anxious
pleading
loving
she
drew
a
long
breath
if
henri
noticed
her
abstraction
he
ignored
it
he
was
all
over
the
little
house
one
moment
he
was
instructing
marie
volubly
to
her
evident
confusion
on
rené
the
guard
he
descended
like
a
young
cyclone
with
warnings
for
mademoiselle
safety
and
comfort
he
was
everywhere
sitting
on
the
bed
to
see
if
it
was
soft
tramping
hard
on
the
upper
floor
to
discover
if
any
plaster
might
loosen
below
and
pausing
in
that
process
to
look
keenly
at
a
windmill
in
the
field
behind
when
he
came
down
it
was
to
say
you
are
not
entirely
alone
in
the
village
after
all
mademoiselle
the
miller
has
come
back
i
shall
visit
him
now
and
explain
he
found
sara
lee
however
still
depressed
she
was
sitting
in
a
low
chair
in
the
kitchen
gazing
thoughtfully
at
the
stove
i
am
here
she
said
and
here
is
the
house
and
a
stove
and
everything
but
there
are
no
shops
and
what
shall
i
make
my
soup
out
of
henri
stared
at
her
rather
blankly
true
he
said
very
true
and
i
never
thought
of
it
then
suddenly
they
both
laughed
the
joyous
ringing
laugh
of
ridiculous
youth
which
can
see
its
own
absurdities
and
laugh
at
them
henri
counted
off
on
his
fingers
i
thought
of
water
he
said
and
a
house
and
firewood
and
kettles
and
furniture
and
there
i
ceased
thinking
it
was
dusk
now
marie
lifted
the
lid
from
the
stove
and
a
warm
red
glow
of
reflected
light
filled
the
little
kitchen
it
was
warm
and
cozy
the
kettle
sang
like
the
purring
of
a
cat
and
something
else
that
had
troubled
sara
lee
came
out
i
wonder
she
said
if
you
are
doing
all
this
only
because
i
well
because
i
persuaded
you
which
she
had
not
do
the
men
really
need
me
here
need
you
mademoiselle
do
they
need
what
little
i
can
give
they
were
smiling
all
the
ones
i
saw
a
belgian
soldier
always
smiles
even
when
he
is
fighting
his
voice
had
lost
its
gayety
and
had
taken
on
a
deeper
note
mademoiselle
i
have
brought
you
here
where
i
can
think
of
no
other
woman
who
would
have
the
courage
to
come
because
you
are
needed
i
can
not
promise
you
entire
safety
his
mouth
tightened
but
i
can
promise
you
work
and
gratitude
such
gratitude
mademoiselle
as
you
may
never
know
again
that
reassured
her
but
in
her
practical
mind
the
matter
of
supplies
loomed
large
she
brought
the
matter
up
again
directly
it
is
to
be
hot
chocolate
and
soup
he
asked
both
if
i
find
i
have
enough
money
soup
only
perhaps
and
soup
takes
meat
of
course
it
should
to
be
strengthening
henri
looked
up
to
see
jean
in
the
doorway
smiling
grimly
it
is
very
simple
jean
said
to
him
in
french
you
have
no
other
duties
of
course
so
each
day
you
shall
buy
in
the
market
place
at
dunkirk
with
american
money
and
i
shall
become
a
delivery
boy
and
bring
out
food
for
mademoiselle
and
whatever
is
needed
henri
smiled
back
at
him
cheerfully
an
excellent
plan
jean
he
said
not
every
day
but
frequently
jean
growled
and
disappeared
however
there
was
the
immediate
present
to
think
of
and
while
jean
thawed
his
hands
at
the
fire
and
sara
lee
was
taking
housewifely
stock
of
her
new
home
henri
disappeared
he
came
back
in
a
half
hour
carrying
in
a
small
basket
butter
eggs
bread
and
potatoes
the
miller
he
explained
cheerfully
to
sara
lee
he
has
still
a
few
hens
and
hidden
somewhere
a
cow
we
can
have
milk
is
there
a
pail
for
marie
to
take
to
the
mill
and
bread
and
an
omelet
that
is
a
meal
there
was
but
one
lamp
which
hung
over
the
kitchen
stove
the
room
across
from
sara
lee
bedroom
contained
a
small
round
dining
table
and
chairs
sara
lee
enveloped
in
a
large
pinafore
apron
made
the
omelet
in
the
kitchen
marie
brought
a
pail
of
fresh
milk
henri
with
a
towel
over
his
left
arm
and
in
absurd
mimicry
of
a
parisian
waiter
laid
the
table
and
jean
dour
jean
caught
a
bit
of
the
infection
and
finding
four
bottles
set
to
work
with
his
pocketknife
to
fit
candles
into
their
necks
standing
in
corners
smiling
useless
against
the
cheerful
english
that
flowed
from
the
kitchen
stove
to
the
dining
room
and
back
again
were
rené
and
marie
it
was
of
no
use
to
attempt
to
help
did
the
fire
burn
low
it
was
the
young
officer
who
went
out
for
fresh
wood
but
rené
could
not
permit
that
twice
he
brought
in
great
armfuls
of
firewood
and
piled
them
neatly
by
the
stove
henri
was
absurdly
happy
again
he
would
come
to
the
door
gravely
with
sara
lee
little
phrase
book
in
hand
and
read
from
it
in
a
solemn
tone
we
have
duck
or
chicken
can
we
get
a
good
dinner
at
a
moderate
price
you
have
spilled
wine
on
my
dress
you
have
a
cigar
thank
you
i
prefer
a
pipe
and
sara
lee
beat
up
the
eggs
and
found
after
a
bad
moment
some
salt
in
a
box
and
then
poured
her
omelet
into
the
pan
she
was
very
anxious
that
it
be
a
good
omelet
she
must
make
good
her
claim
as
a
cook
or
henri
sublime
faith
in
her
would
die
it
was
a
divine
omelet
even
jean
said
so
they
sat
the
three
of
them
in
the
cold
little
dining
room
and
never
knew
that
it
was
cold
and
they
ate
prodigious
quantities
of
omelet
and
bread
and
butter
and
bully
beef
out
of
a
tin
and
drank
a
great
deal
of
milk
even
jean
thawed
at
last
under
the
influence
of
food
and
sara
lee
before
the
meal
was
over
he
was
planning
how
to
get
her
supplies
to
her
and
making
notes
on
a
piece
of
paper
as
to
what
she
would
need
at
once
they
adjourned
to
sara
lee
bedroom
where
marie
had
kindled
a
fire
in
the
little
iron
stove
and
sat
there
in
the
warmth
with
two
candles
still
planning
by
that
time
sara
lee
had
quite
forgotten
that
at
home
one
did
not
have
visitors
in
one
bedroom
suddenly
henri
held
up
his
hand
listen
he
said
that
was
the
first
time
sara
lee
had
ever
heard
the
quiet
shuffling
step
of
tired
men
leaving
their
trenches
under
cover
of
darkness
henri
threw
his
military
cape
over
her
shoulders
and
she
stood
in
the
dark
doorway
watching
the
empty
street
was
no
longer
empty
from
gutter
to
gutter
flowed
a
stream
of
men
like
a
sluggish
river
which
narrowed
where
a
fallen
house
partly
filled
the
way
not
talking
not
singing
just
moving
bent
under
their
heavy
and
equipment
here
and
there
the
clack
of
wooden
sabots
on
the
cobbles
told
of
one
poor
fellow
not
outfitted
with
leather
shoes
the
light
of
a
match
here
and
there
showed
some
few
lucky
enough
to
have
still
remaining
cigarettes
and
revealed
also
in
the
immediate
vicinity
a
white
bandage
or
two
some
few
recognizing
henri
officer
cap
saluted
most
of
them
stumbled
on
too
weary
to
so
much
as
glance
aside
nothing
that
sara
lee
had
dreamed
of
war
was
like
this
this
was
dreary
and
sodden
and
hopeless
those
fresh
troops
at
the
crossroads
that
day
had
been
blithe
and
smiling
there
had
been
none
of
the
glitter
and
panoply
of
war
but
there
had
been
movement
the
beating
of
a
drum
the
sharp
cries
of
officers
as
the
lines
here
there
were
no
lines
just
such
a
stream
of
men
as
at
home
might
issue
at
night
from
a
coal
mine
too
weary
for
speech
only
here
they
were
packed
together
closely
and
they
did
not
speak
and
some
of
them
were
wounded
there
are
so
many
she
whispered
to
henri
a
hundred
such
efforts
as
mine
would
not
be
enough
i
would
to
god
there
were
more
henri
replied
through
shut
teeth
listen
mademoiselle
he
said
later
you
can
not
do
all
the
kind
work
of
the
world
but
you
can
do
your
part
and
you
will
start
by
caring
for
only
such
as
are
wounded
or
ill
the
others
can
go
on
but
every
night
some
twenty
or
thirty
or
even
more
will
come
to
your
door
men
slightly
wounded
or
too
weary
to
go
on
without
a
rest
and
for
those
there
will
be
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
something
hot
or
perhaps
a
clean
bandage
it
sounds
small
but
in
a
month
think
you
will
have
given
comfort
to
perhaps
a
thousand
men
you
alone
i
alone
she
said
in
a
queer
choking
voice
and
what
about
you
it
is
you
who
have
made
it
possible
but
henri
was
looking
down
the
street
to
where
the
row
of
poplars
hid
what
lay
beyond
far
beyond
a
star
shell
had
risen
above
the
flat
fields
and
floated
there
a
pure
and
lovely
thing
shedding
its
white
light
over
the
terrain
below
it
gleamed
for
some
thirty
seconds
and
went
out
like
that
henri
said
to
her
but
in
french
like
that
you
are
to
me
bright
and
shining
and
so
soon
gone
sara
lee
thought
he
had
asked
her
if
she
was
cold
xi
the
girl
was
singularly
adaptable
in
a
few
days
it
was
as
though
she
had
been
for
years
in
her
little
ruined
house
she
was
very
happy
though
there
was
scarcely
a
day
when
her
heart
was
not
wrung
such
faces
such
weary
men
and
such
tales
of
wretchedness
she
got
the
tales
by
intuition
rather
than
by
words
though
she
was
picking
up
some
french
at
that
marie
would
weep
openly
at
times
the
most
frequent
story
was
of
no
news
from
the
country
held
by
the
germans
of
families
left
with
nothing
and
probably
starving
the
first
inquiry
was
always
for
news
had
the
american
lady
any
way
to
make
inquiry
in
time
sara
lee
began
to
take
notes
of
names
and
addresses
and
through
travers
in
london
and
the
relief
commission
in
belgium
bits
of
information
came
back
a
certain
family
was
in
england
at
a
village
in
surrey
of
another
a
child
had
died
here
was
one
that
could
not
be
located
and
another
reported
massacred
during
the
invasion
later
on
sara
lee
was
to
find
her
little
house
growing
famous
besieged
by
anxious
soldiers
who
besought
her
efforts
so
that
she
used
enormous
numbers
of
stamps
and
a
great
deal
of
effort
but
that
was
later
on
and
when
that
time
came
she
turned
to
the
work
as
a
refuge
from
her
thoughts
for
days
were
coming
when
sara
lee
did
not
want
to
think
but
like
all
big
things
the
little
house
made
a
humble
beginning
a
mere
handful
of
men
daring
the
gibes
of
their
comrades
stopped
in
that
first
night
the
door
stood
open
with
its
invitation
of
firelight
and
candles
but
these
few
went
away
with
a
strange
story
of
a
beautiful
american
and
hot
soup
and
even
a
cigarette
apiece
that
had
been
contribution
the
cigarettes
and
soon
the
fame
of
the
little
house
went
up
and
down
the
trenches
and
it
was
like
to
die
of
overpopularity
it
was
at
night
that
the
little
house
of
mercy
bloomed
like
a
flower
during
the
daytime
it
was
quiet
and
it
was
then
as
time
went
on
that
sara
lee
wrote
her
letters
home
and
to
england
and
sent
her
lists
of
names
to
be
investigated
but
from
the
beginning
there
was
much
to
do
vegetables
were
to
be
prepared
for
the
soup
marie
must
find
and
bring
in
milk
for
the
chocolate
rené
must
lay
aside
his
rifle
and
chop
firewood
one
worry
however
disappeared
with
the
days
henri
was
proving
a
clever
buyer
the
money
she
sent
in
secured
marvels
only
jean
knew
or
ever
knew
just
how
much
of
henri
steadily
decreasing
funds
went
to
that
buying
certainly
not
sara
lee
and
jean
expostulated
only
once
to
be
met
by
such
blazing
fury
as
set
him
sullen
for
two
days
i
am
doing
this
henri
finished
a
trifle
ashamed
of
himself
not
for
mademoiselle
but
for
our
army
and
since
when
have
you
felt
that
the
best
we
can
give
is
too
much
for
such
a
purpose
which
was
however
lofty
only
a
part
of
the
truth
so
supplies
came
in
plentifully
and
sara
lee
pared
vegetables
and
sang
a
bit
under
her
breath
and
glowed
with
good
will
when
at
night
the
weary
vanguard
of
a
weary
little
army
stopped
at
her
door
and
scraped
the
mud
off
its
boots
and
edged
in
shyly
she
was
very
happy
and
her
soup
was
growing
famous
it
is
true
that
the
beef
she
used
was
not
often
beef
but
she
did
not
know
that
and
merely
complained
that
the
meat
was
stringy
now
and
then
there
was
no
beef
at
all
and
she
used
hares
instead
on
quiet
days
when
there
was
little
firing
beyond
the
poplar
trees
she
went
about
with
a
basket
through
the
neglected
winter
gardens
of
the
town
there
were
brussels
sprouts
and
sometimes
she
found
in
a
cellar
carrots
or
cabbages
she
had
potatoes
always
it
was
at
night
then
from
seven
in
the
evening
until
one
that
the
little
house
was
busiest
word
had
gone
out
through
the
trenches
beyond
the
poplar
trees
that
slightly
wounded
men
needing
rest
before
walking
back
to
their
billets
exhausted
and
sick
men
were
welcome
to
the
little
house
it
was
soon
necessary
to
give
the
officers
tickets
for
the
men
rené
took
them
in
at
the
door
with
his
rifle
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
and
he
was
as
implacable
as
a
ticket
taker
at
the
opera
never
once
in
all
the
months
of
her
life
there
did
sara
lee
have
an
ugly
word
an
offensive
glance
but
though
she
never
knew
this
many
half
articulate
and
wholly
earnest
prayers
were
offered
for
her
in
those
little
churches
behind
the
lines
where
sometimes
the
men
slept
and
often
they
prayed
she
was
very
businesslike
she
sent
home
to
the
ladies
aid
society
a
weekly
record
of
what
had
been
done
so
many
bowls
of
soup
so
many
cups
of
chocolate
so
many
minor
injuries
dressed
because
very
soon
she
found
first
aid
added
to
her
activities
she
sickened
somewhat
at
first
later
she
allowed
to
marie
much
of
the
serving
of
food
and
in
the
little
à
she
had
ready
on
the
table
basins
water
cotton
iodine
and
bandages
henri
explained
the
method
to
her
it
is
a
matter
of
cleanliness
he
said
first
one
washes
the
wound
and
then
there
is
the
iodine
then
cotton
a
bandage
and
a
surgeon
could
do
little
more
henri
and
jean
came
often
and
more
than
once
during
the
first
ten
days
jean
spent
the
night
rolled
in
a
blanket
by
the
kitchen
fire
and
henri
disappeared
he
was
always
back
in
the
morning
however
looking
dirty
and
very
tired
sara
lee
sewed
more
than
one
rent
for
him
those
days
but
she
was
strangely
incurious
it
was
as
though
where
everything
was
strange
henri
erratic
comings
and
goings
were
but
a
part
with
the
rest
then
one
night
the
unexpected
happened
the
village
was
shelled
sara
lee
had
received
her
first
letter
from
harvey
that
day
the
maid
at
morley
had
forwarded
it
to
her
and
henri
had
brought
it
up
i
think
i
have
brought
you
something
you
wish
for
very
much
he
said
looking
down
at
her
mutton
she
inquired
anxiously
better
than
that
sugar
a
letter
mademoiselle
afterward
he
could
not
quite
understand
the
way
she
had
suddenly
drawn
in
her
breath
he
had
no
memory
as
she
had
of
harvey
obstinate
anger
at
her
going
his
conviction
that
she
was
doing
a
thing
criminally
wrong
and
cruel
give
it
to
me
please
she
took
it
into
her
room
and
closed
the
door
when
she
came
out
again
she
was
composed
and
quiet
but
rather
white
poor
henri
he
was
half
mad
that
day
with
jealousy
her
whiteness
he
construed
as
longing
this
is
a
part
of
harvey
letter
you
may
think
that
i
have
become
reconciled
but
i
have
not
if
i
could
see
any
reason
for
it
i
might
but
what
reason
is
there
so
many
others
older
and
more
experienced
could
do
what
you
are
doing
and
more
safely
in
your
letter
from
the
steamer
you
tell
me
not
to
worry
good
god
sara
lee
how
can
i
help
worrying
i
do
not
even
know
where
you
are
if
you
are
in
england
well
and
good
if
you
are
abroad
i
do
not
want
to
know
it
i
know
these
foreigners
i
run
into
them
every
day
and
they
do
not
understand
american
women
i
get
crazy
when
i
think
about
it
i
have
had
to
let
the
leete
house
go
there
is
not
likely
to
be
such
a
chance
soon
again
business
is
good
but
i
do
seem
to
care
much
about
it
any
more
honestly
dear
i
think
you
have
treated
me
very
badly
i
always
feel
as
though
the
people
i
meet
are
wondering
if
we
have
quarreled
or
what
on
earth
took
you
away
on
this
chase
i
do
know
myself
so
how
can
i
tell
them
i
shall
always
love
you
sara
lee
i
guess
i
that
sort
but
sometimes
i
wonder
if
when
we
are
married
you
will
leave
me
again
in
some
such
way
i
warn
you
now
dear
that
i
wo
stand
for
it
suffering
too
much
harvey
sara
lee
wore
the
letter
next
her
heart
but
it
did
not
warm
her
she
went
through
the
next
few
hours
in
a
sort
of
frozen
composure
and
ate
nothing
at
all
then
came
the
bombardment
henri
and
jean
driving
out
from
dunkirk
had
passed
on
the
road
ammunition
trains
waiting
in
the
road
until
dark
before
moving
on
to
the
front
henri
had
given
sara
lee
her
letter
had
watched
jealously
for
its
effect
on
her
and
then
his
own
face
white
and
set
had
gone
on
down
the
ruined
street
here
within
the
walls
of
a
destroyed
house
he
disappeared
the
place
was
evidently
familiar
to
him
for
he
moved
without
hesitation
broken
furniture
still
stood
in
the
roofless
rooms
and
in
front
of
a
battered
bureau
henri
paused
still
whistling
under
his
breath
he
took
off
his
uniform
and
donned
a
strange
one
of
greenish
gray
in
the
pocket
of
the
blouse
he
stuffed
a
soft
round
cap
of
the
same
color
then
resuming
his
cape
and
belgian
cap
with
its
tassel
over
his
forehead
he
went
out
into
the
street
again
he
carried
in
his
belt
a
pistol
but
it
was
not
the
one
he
had
brought
in
with
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
the
addition
of
the
cap
in
his
pocket
henri
was
at
that
moment
in
the
full
uniform
of
a
of
a
bavarian
infantry
regiment
pistol
and
all
he
went
down
the
street
and
along
the
road
toward
the
poplars
he
met
the
first
detachment
of
men
out
of
the
trenches
just
beyond
the
trees
and
stepped
aside
into
the
mud
to
let
them
pass
calling
a
greeting
to
them
out
of
the
darkness
they
replied
and
saluted
stiffly
there
were
few
among
them
who
did
not
know
his
voice
and
fewer
still
who
did
not
suspect
his
business
a
brave
man
they
said
among
themselves
as
they
went
on
how
long
will
he
last
asked
one
young
soldier
a
boy
in
his
teens
one
can
not
live
long
who
does
as
he
does
replied
a
gaunt
and
bearded
man
but
it
is
a
fine
life
while
it
continues
a
fine
life
the
boy
stepped
out
of
the
shuffling
line
and
looked
behind
him
he
could
see
only
the
glow
of
henri
eternal
cigarette
i
should
like
to
go
with
him
he
muttered
wistfully
the
ammunition
train
was
in
the
village
now
it
kept
the
center
of
the
road
lest
it
should
slide
into
the
mud
on
either
side
and
be
mired
the
men
moved
out
of
its
way
into
the
ditch
grumbling
henri
went
whistling
softly
down
the
road
the
first
shell
fell
in
the
neglected
square
the
second
struck
the
rear
wagons
of
the
ammunition
train
henri
heard
the
terrific
explosion
that
followed
and
turning
ran
madly
back
into
the
village
more
shells
fell
into
the
road
the
men
scattered
like
partridges
running
for
the
fields
but
the
drivers
of
the
ammunition
wagons
beat
their
horses
and
came
lurching
and
shouting
down
the
road
there
was
cold
terror
in
henri
heart
he
ran
madly
throwing
aside
his
cape
as
he
went
more
shells
fell
ahead
in
the
street
once
in
the
darkness
he
fell
flat
over
the
body
of
a
horse
there
was
a
steady
groaning
from
the
ditch
near
by
but
he
got
up
and
ran
on
a
strange
figure
with
his
flying
hair
and
his
german
uniform
he
was
all
but
stabbed
by
rené
when
he
entered
the
little
house
mademoiselle
henri
gasped
holding
rené
bayonet
away
from
his
heaving
chest
i
am
here
said
sara
lee
voice
from
the
little
à
let
them
carry
in
the
wounded
i
am
getting
ready
hot
water
and
bandages
there
is
not
much
space
for
the
corner
of
the
room
has
been
shot
away
she
was
as
dead
white
in
the
candlelight
but
very
calm
you
can
not
stay
here
henri
panted
at
any
time
another
shell
fell
followed
by
the
rumble
of
falling
walls
some
one
must
stay
said
sara
lee
there
must
be
wounded
in
the
streets
marie
is
in
the
cellar
henri
pleaded
passionately
with
her
to
go
to
the
cellar
but
she
refused
he
would
have
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
there
but
jean
came
in
leading
a
wounded
man
and
henri
gave
up
in
despair
all
that
night
they
worked
a
ghastly
business
more
than
one
man
died
that
night
in
the
little
house
while
a
blond
young
man
in
a
german
uniform
gave
him
a
last
mouthful
of
water
or
took
down
those
pitifully
vague
addresses
which
were
all
the
dying
belgians
had
to
give
i
have
not
heard
last
at
aarschot
but
now
god
knows
where
no
more
shells
fell
at
dawn
with
all
done
that
could
be
done
sara
lee
fainted
quietly
in
the
hallway
henri
carried
her
in
and
placed
her
on
her
bed
a
corner
of
the
room
was
indeed
gone
the
mantel
was
shattered
and
the
little
stove
but
on
the
floor
lay
harvey
photograph
uninjured
henri
lifted
it
and
looked
at
it
then
he
placed
it
on
the
table
and
very
reverently
he
kissed
the
palm
of
sara
lee
quiet
hand
daylight
found
the
street
pitiful
indeed
henri
whose
costume
rené
had
been
casting
wondering
glances
at
all
night
sent
a
request
for
men
from
the
trenches
to
clear
away
the
bodies
of
the
horses
and
bury
them
and
somewhat
later
over
a
single
grave
in
the
fields
there
was
a
simple
ceremony
of
burial
for
the
men
who
had
fallen
henri
had
changed
again
by
that
time
but
he
sternly
forbade
sara
lee
to
attend
on
pain
he
said
of
no
more
supplies
mademoiselle
these
things
must
be
they
are
war
but
you
can
do
nothing
to
help
and
it
will
be
very
sad
ambulances
took
away
the
wounded
at
dawn
and
the
little
house
became
quiet
once
more
with
planks
rené
repaired
the
damage
to
the
corner
and
triumphantly
produced
and
set
up
another
stove
he
even
put
up
a
mantelshelf
and
on
it
smiling
somewhat
he
placed
harvey
picture
sara
lee
saw
it
there
and
a
tiny
seed
of
resentment
took
root
and
grew
if
there
had
been
no
one
here
last
night
she
said
to
the
photograph
many
more
would
have
died
how
can
you
say
i
am
cruel
to
you
this
worth
the
doing
but
harvey
remained
impassive
detached
his
eyes
on
the
white
muslin
screen
and
the
angle
of
his
jaw
was
set
and
dogged
illustration
henri
explained
the
method
xii
that
morning
there
was
a
conference
in
the
little
house
colonel
lilias
who
had
come
in
before
for
a
mute
but
appreciative
call
on
sara
lee
and
for
a
cup
of
chocolate
captain
tournay
jean
and
henri
it
was
held
round
the
little
table
in
the
à
after
marie
had
brought
coffee
and
gone
out
they
had
information
undoubtedly
said
the
colonel
the
same
thing
happened
at
pervyse
when
an
ammunition
train
went
through
they
had
the
place
and
what
is
more
they
had
the
time
of
course
there
are
the
airmen
it
did
not
leave
the
main
road
until
too
late
for
observation
from
the
air
henri
put
in
shortly
yet
any
one
who
saw
it
waiting
at
the
crossroads
might
have
learned
its
destination
the
drivers
talk
sometimes
but
the
word
had
to
be
carried
across
said
captain
tournay
that
is
the
point
my
men
report
flashes
of
lights
from
the
fields
we
have
followed
them
up
and
found
no
houses
no
anything
in
this
flat
country
a
small
light
travels
far
i
shall
try
to
learn
henri
said
it
is
of
course
possible
that
some
one
from
over
there
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
think
not
colonel
lilias
put
a
hand
on
henri
shoulder
affectionately
they
have
not
your
finesse
boy
and
i
doubt
if
in
all
their
army
they
have
so
brave
a
man
henri
flushed
there
is
a
courage
under
fire
with
their
fellows
round
that
is
one
thing
and
a
courage
of
attack
that
is
even
more
simple
but
the
bravest
man
is
the
one
who
works
alone
the
man
to
whom
capture
is
death
without
honor
the
meeting
broke
up
jean
and
henri
went
away
in
the
car
and
though
supplies
came
up
regularly
sara
lee
did
not
see
the
battered
gray
car
for
four
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
henri
came
alone
jean
he
said
briefly
was
laid
up
for
a
little
while
with
a
flesh
wound
in
his
shoulder
he
would
be
well
very
soon
in
the
meantime
here
at
last
was
mutton
it
had
come
from
england
and
he
henri
had
found
it
lying
forgotten
and
lonely
and
very
sad
and
had
brought
it
along
after
that
henri
disappeared
on
foot
it
was
midafternoon
and
a
sunny
day
sara
lee
saw
him
walking
briskly
across
the
fields
and
watched
him
out
of
sight
she
spoke
some
french
now
and
she
had
gathered
from
rené
who
had
no
scruples
about
listening
at
a
door
that
henri
was
the
bravest
man
in
the
belgian
army
until
now
sara
lee
had
given
small
thought
to
henri
occupation
she
knew
nothing
of
war
and
the
fact
that
henri
while
wearing
a
uniform
was
unattached
had
not
greatly
impressed
her
had
she
known
the
constitution
of
a
modern
army
she
might
have
wondered
over
his
freedom
his
powerful
car
his
passes
and
maps
but
his
detachment
had
not
seemed
odd
to
her
even
his
appearance
during
the
bombardment
in
the
uniform
of
a
german
had
meant
nothing
to
her
she
had
never
seen
a
german
uniform
that
evening
however
when
he
returned
she
ventured
a
question
they
dined
together
the
two
of
them
for
the
first
time
at
the
little
house
alone
always
before
jean
had
made
the
third
and
it
was
a
real
meal
for
sara
lee
had
sacrificed
a
bit
of
mutton
from
her
soup
and
henri
had
produced
from
his
pocket
a
few
small
and
withered
oranges
a
gift
he
said
gayly
and
piled
them
in
a
precarious
heap
in
the
center
of
the
table
on
the
exact
top
he
placed
a
walnut
now
speak
gently
and
walk
softly
he
said
it
is
a
work
of
art
and
not
to
be
lightly
demolished
he
was
alternately
gay
and
silent
during
the
meal
and
more
than
once
sara
lee
found
his
eyes
on
her
with
something
new
and
different
in
them
just
you
and
i
together
he
said
once
it
is
very
wonderful
and
again
when
you
go
back
to
him
shall
you
tell
him
of
your
good
friend
who
has
tried
hard
to
serve
you
of
course
i
shall
said
sara
lee
and
he
will
write
you
i
know
he
will
be
very
grateful
but
it
was
she
who
was
silent
after
that
because
somehow
it
would
be
hard
to
make
harvey
understand
and
as
for
his
being
grateful
mademoiselle
said
henri
later
on
would
you
object
if
i
make
a
suggestion
you
wear
a
very
valuable
ring
i
think
it
is
entirely
safe
but
who
can
tell
and
also
it
is
not
entirely
kind
to
remind
men
who
are
far
from
all
they
love
that
you
sara
lee
flushed
and
took
off
her
ring
i
am
glad
you
told
me
she
said
and
henri
did
not
explain
that
the
belgian
soldiers
would
not
recognize
the
ring
as
either
a
diamond
or
a
symbol
but
that
to
him
it
was
close
to
torture
it
was
when
he
insisted
on
carrying
out
the
dishes
singing
a
little
french
song
as
he
did
so
that
sara
lee
decided
to
speak
what
was
in
her
mind
he
was
in
high
spirits
then
mademoiselle
he
said
shall
i
show
you
something
that
the
eye
of
no
man
has
seen
before
and
that
when
we
have
seen
it
shall
never
be
seen
again
on
her
interested
consent
he
called
in
marie
and
rené
making
a
great
ceremony
of
the
matter
and
sending
marie
into
hysterical
giggling
now
see
he
said
earnestly
no
eye
before
has
ever
seen
or
will
again
will
you
guess
mademoiselle
or
you
marie
rené
a
tear
ventured
sara
lee
but
do
i
look
like
weeping
he
did
not
indeed
he
stood
tall
and
young
and
smiling
before
them
and
produced
from
his
pocket
the
walnut
perceive
he
said
breaking
it
open
and
showing
the
kernel
has
human
eye
ever
before
seen
it
he
thrust
it
into
marie
open
mouth
and
it
is
gone
it
was
that
evening
while
sara
lee
cut
bandages
and
henri
rolled
them
that
she
asked
him
what
his
work
was
he
looked
rather
surprised
and
rolled
for
a
moment
without
replying
then
i
am
a
man
of
all
work
he
said
what
you
call
odd
jobs
then
you
do
do
any
fighting
in
the
trenches
no
but
now
and
then
i
have
a
little
skirmish
a
sort
of
fear
had
been
formulating
itself
in
sara
lee
mind
the
trenches
she
could
understand
or
was
beginning
to
understand
but
this
alternately
joyous
and
silent
idler
this
soldier
of
no
regiment
and
no
detail
was
he
playing
a
man
part
in
the
war
why
do
you
go
into
the
trenches
she
asked
with
her
usual
directness
you
say
there
are
too
few
men
yet
i
can
understand
monsieur
jean
because
he
has
only
one
eye
but
you
i
do
something
he
said
avoiding
her
eyes
it
is
not
a
great
deal
it
is
the
thing
i
can
do
best
that
is
all
he
went
away
some
time
after
that
leaving
the
little
house
full
and
busy
justifying
its
existence
the
miller
son
who
came
daily
to
chat
with
marie
was
helping
in
the
kitchen
by
the
warm
stove
and
only
kept
from
standing
over
it
by
marie
sharp
orders
were
as
many
men
as
could
get
near
each
held
a
bowl
of
hot
soup
and
that
being
a
good
day
a
piece
of
bread
tall
soldiers
and
little
ones
all
dirty
all
weary
almost
all
smiling
they
peered
over
each
other
shoulders
to
catch
if
might
be
a
glimpse
of
marie
face
when
they
came
too
close
she
poked
an
elbow
into
some
hulking
fellow
and
sent
him
back
in
the
name
of
god
she
would
beg
over
all
the
room
hung
the
warm
steam
from
the
kettles
and
a
delicious
odor
and
peace
sara
lee
had
never
heard
of
the
word
she
would
have
been
astonished
to
have
been
told
that
she
was
helping
the
of
an
army
but
she
gave
each
night
in
that
little
house
of
mercy
something
that
nothing
else
could
give
warmth
and
welcome
but
above
all
a
touch
of
home
that
night
henri
did
not
come
back
she
stood
by
her
table
bandaging
washing
small
wounds
talking
her
bits
of
french
until
one
then
the
last
dressing
done
she
went
to
the
kitchen
marie
was
there
with
maurice
the
miller
son
has
the
captain
returned
she
asked
not
yet
mademoiselle
leave
a
warm
fire
sara
lee
said
he
will
probably
come
in
later
maurice
went
away
with
a
civil
good
night
sara
lee
stood
in
the
doorway
after
he
had
gone
looking
out
farther
along
the
line
there
was
a
bombardment
going
on
she
knew
now
what
a
bombardment
meant
and
her
brows
contracted
somewhere
there
in
the
trenches
men
were
enduring
that
while
henri
she
said
a
little
additional
prayer
that
night
which
was
that
she
should
have
courage
to
say
to
him
what
she
felt
that
there
were
big
things
to
do
and
that
it
should
not
all
be
left
to
these
smiling
peasant
soldiers
at
that
moment
henri
in
his
uniform
was
cutting
wire
before
a
german
trench
one
of
a
party
of
german
soldiers
who
could
not
know
in
the
darkness
that
there
had
been
a
strange
addition
to
their
group
cutting
wire
and
learning
many
things
which
it
was
well
that
he
should
know
now
and
then
in
perfect
german
he
whispered
a
question
always
he
received
a
reply
and
stowed
it
away
in
his
tenacious
memory
for
those
it
most
concerned
at
daylight
he
was
asleep
by
sara
lee
kitchen
fire
and
at
daylight
sara
lee
was
awakened
by
much
firing
and
putting
on
a
dressing
gown
she
went
out
to
see
what
was
happening
rené
was
in
the
street
looking
toward
the
poplar
trees
an
attack
he
said
briefly
you
mean
the
germans
yes
mademoiselle
she
went
back
into
the
little
ruined
house
she
knew
now
what
it
meant
an
attack
that
night
there
would
be
ambulances
in
the
street
and
word
would
come
up
that
certain
men
were
gone
would
never
seek
warmth
and
shelter
in
her
kitchen
or
beg
like
children
for
a
second
bowl
of
soup
on
the
kitchen
floor
by
the
dying
fire
henri
lay
asleep
xiii
much
has
been
said
of
the
work
of
spies
said
and
written
here
is
a
woman
in
paris
sending
forbidden
messages
on
a
marked
coin
men
are
tapped
on
the
shoulder
by
a
civil
gentleman
in
a
sack
suit
and
walk
away
with
him
never
to
be
seen
again
but
of
one
sort
of
spy
nothing
has
been
written
and
but
little
is
known
yet
by
him
are
battles
won
or
lost
on
the
intelligence
he
brings
attacks
are
prepared
for
and
launched
it
is
not
always
the
airman
in
these
days
of
camouflage
who
brings
word
of
ammunition
trains
or
of
new
batteries
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
the
work
of
the
secret
service
at
the
front
was
of
the
gravest
importance
there
were
fewer
air
machines
and
observation
from
the
air
was
a
new
science
also
trench
systems
were
incomplete
between
them
known
to
a
few
were
breaks
of
solid
land
guarded
from
behind
to
one
who
knew
it
was
possible
though
dangerous
beyond
words
to
cross
the
inundated
country
that
lay
between
the
belgian
front
and
the
german
lines
and
even
with
good
luck
to
go
farther
henri
for
instance
on
that
night
before
had
left
the
advanced
trench
at
the
railway
line
had
crawled
through
the
belgian
barbed
wire
and
had
advanced
standing
motionless
as
each
star
shell
burst
overhead
and
then
moving
on
quickly
the
inundation
was
his
greatest
difficulty
shallow
in
most
places
it
was
full
of
hidden
wire
and
crisscrossed
with
irrigation
ditches
once
he
stumbled
into
one
but
he
got
out
by
swimming
had
he
been
laden
with
a
rifle
and
equipment
it
might
have
been
difficult
he
swore
to
himself
as
his
feet
touched
ground
again
for
a
star
shell
was
hanging
overhead
and
his
efforts
had
sent
wide
and
ever
increasingly
widening
circles
over
the
placid
surface
of
the
lagoon
let
them
lap
to
the
german
outposts
and
he
was
lost
henri
method
was
peculiar
to
himself
where
there
was
dry
terrain
he
did
as
did
the
others
crouched
and
crept
but
here
in
the
salt
marshes
where
the
sea
had
been
called
to
belgium
aid
he
had
evolved
a
system
of
moving
neck
deep
in
water
stopping
under
the
white
night
lights
advancing
in
the
darkness
there
was
no
shelter
the
country
was
flat
as
a
hearth
he
would
crawl
out
at
last
in
the
darkness
and
lie
flat
as
the
dead
lie
and
then
inch
by
inch
he
would
work
his
way
forward
by
routes
that
he
knew
sometimes
he
went
entirely
through
the
german
lines
and
reconnoitered
on
the
roads
behind
they
were
shallow
lines
then
for
the
inundation
made
the
country
almost
untenable
and
a
charge
in
force
from
the
belgians
across
was
unlikely
henri
knew
his
country
well
as
well
as
he
loved
it
in
a
farmhouse
behind
the
german
lines
he
sometimes
doffed
his
wet
uniform
and
put
on
the
clothing
of
a
belgian
peasant
trust
henri
then
for
being
a
lout
a
simple
fellow
who
spoke
only
flemish
but
could
hear
in
many
tongues
watch
him
standing
at
crossroads
and
marveling
at
big
guns
that
rumble
by
at
first
henri
had
wished
having
learned
of
an
attack
to
be
among
those
who
repelled
it
then
one
day
his
king
had
sent
for
him
to
come
to
that
little
village
which
was
now
his
capital
city
he
had
been
sent
in
alone
and
had
found
the
king
at
the
table
writing
henri
bowed
and
waited
they
were
not
unlike
these
two
men
only
henri
was
younger
and
lighter
and
where
the
king
eyes
were
gray
henri
were
blue
such
a
queer
setting
for
a
king
it
was
a
tawdry
summer
home
and
cheaply
furnished
but
by
the
presence
of
belgium
man
of
all
time
it
became
royal
so
henri
bowed
and
waited
and
soon
the
king
got
up
and
shook
hands
with
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
knew
each
other
rather
well
but
to
explain
more
would
be
to
tell
that
family
name
of
henri
which
must
never
be
known
sit
down
said
the
king
gravely
and
he
got
a
box
of
cigars
from
the
mantelpiece
and
offered
it
i
sent
for
you
because
i
want
to
talk
to
you
you
are
doing
valuable
work
i
am
glad
you
think
it
so
sire
said
henri
rather
unhappily
because
he
felt
what
was
coming
but
i
can
not
do
it
all
the
time
there
are
intervals
an
ordinary
mortal
may
not
interrupt
a
king
but
a
king
may
interrupt
anything
except
perhaps
a
german
bombardment
intervals
of
course
if
there
were
not
you
would
be
done
in
a
month
but
i
am
a
soldier
my
place
is
your
place
is
where
you
are
most
useful
henri
was
getting
nothing
out
of
the
cigar
he
flung
it
away
and
got
up
i
want
to
fight
too
he
said
stubbornly
we
need
every
man
and
i
am
rather
a
good
shot
i
do
this
other
because
i
can
do
it
i
speak
their
infernal
tongue
but
it
dirty
business
at
the
best
sire
he
remembered
to
put
in
the
sire
but
rather
ungraciously
indeed
he
shot
it
out
like
a
bullet
dirty
business
said
the
king
thoughtfully
i
see
what
you
mean
it
is
of
course
but
not
so
dirty
as
the
things
they
have
done
and
are
doing
he
sat
still
and
let
henri
stamp
up
and
down
because
as
has
been
said
he
knew
the
boy
and
he
had
never
been
one
to
insist
on
deference
which
was
why
he
got
so
much
of
it
but
at
last
he
got
up
and
when
henri
stood
still
rather
ashamed
of
himself
he
put
an
arm
over
the
boy
shoulders
i
want
you
to
do
this
thing
for
me
and
this
thing
only
he
said
it
is
the
work
you
do
best
there
are
others
who
can
fight
but
i
do
not
know
any
one
else
who
can
do
as
you
have
done
henri
promised
he
would
have
promised
to
go
out
and
drown
himself
in
the
sea
just
beyond
the
little
garden
for
the
tall
grave
man
who
stood
before
him
then
he
bowed
and
went
out
and
the
king
went
back
to
his
plain
pine
table
and
his
work
that
was
the
reason
why
sara
lee
found
him
asleep
on
the
floor
by
her
kitchen
stove
that
morning
and
went
back
to
her
cold
bed
to
lie
awake
and
think
but
no
explanation
came
to
her
the
arrival
of
marie
roused
henri
the
worst
of
the
bombardment
was
over
but
there
was
desultory
firing
he
listened
carefully
before
standing
outside
in
the
cold
he
poured
over
his
head
and
shoulders
a
pail
of
cold
water
he
was
drying
himself
vigorously
when
he
heard
sara
lee
voice
in
the
kitchen
the
day
began
for
henri
when
first
he
saw
the
girl
it
might
be
evening
but
it
was
the
beginning
for
him
so
he
went
in
when
he
had
finished
his
toilet
and
bowed
over
her
hand
you
are
cold
mademoiselle
i
think
i
am
nervous
there
was
an
attack
this
morning
yes
marie
had
gone
into
the
next
room
and
sara
lee
raised
haggard
eyes
to
his
henri
she
said
desperately
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
called
him
that
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
it
not
very
pleasant
you
are
going
home
it
was
the
worst
thing
he
could
think
of
but
she
shook
her
head
you
will
think
me
most
ungrateful
and
unkind
you
kindness
itself
but
this
is
different
it
is
not
for
myself
it
is
because
i
care
a
great
deal
about
about
mademoiselle
about
your
honor
and
somehow
this
morning
when
i
found
you
here
asleep
and
those
poor
fellows
in
the
trenches
fighting
henri
stared
at
her
so
that
was
it
and
he
could
never
tell
her
he
was
sworn
to
secrecy
by
every
tradition
and
instinct
of
his
work
he
could
never
tell
her
and
she
would
go
on
thinking
him
a
shirker
and
a
coward
she
would
be
grateful
she
would
be
sweetness
itself
but
deep
in
her
heart
she
would
loathe
him
as
only
women
can
hate
for
a
failing
they
never
forgive
but
i
have
told
you
he
said
rather
wildly
i
am
not
idle
i
do
certain
things
not
much
but
of
a
degree
of
importance
you
do
not
fight
in
sara
lee
defense
many
things
may
be
urged
her
ignorance
of
modern
warfare
the
isolation
of
her
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
language
but
perhaps
more
than
anything
a
certain
rigidity
of
standard
that
comprehended
no
halfway
ground
right
was
right
and
wrong
was
wrong
to
her
in
those
days
men
were
brave
or
were
cowards
henri
was
worthy
or
unworthy
and
she
felt
that
for
all
his
kindness
to
her
he
was
unworthy
he
could
have
set
himself
right
with
a
word
at
that
but
his
pride
was
hurt
he
said
nothing
except
when
she
asked
if
he
had
minded
what
she
said
to
reply
i
am
sorry
you
feel
as
you
do
i
am
not
angry
he
went
away
however
without
breakfast
sara
lee
heard
his
car
going
at
its
usual
breakneck
speed
up
the
street
and
went
to
the
door
she
would
have
called
him
back
if
she
could
for
his
eyes
haunted
her
but
he
did
not
look
back
xiv
for
four
days
the
gray
car
did
not
come
again
supplies
appeared
in
another
gray
car
driven
by
a
surly
fleming
the
waking
hours
were
full
as
usual
sara
lee
grew
a
little
thin
and
seemed
to
be
always
listening
but
there
was
no
henri
and
something
that
was
vivid
and
joyous
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
the
little
house
even
marie
no
longer
sang
as
she
swept
or
washed
the
kettles
and
sara
lee
making
up
the
records
to
send
home
put
little
spirit
into
the
letter
that
went
with
them
on
the
second
day
she
wrote
to
harvey
i
am
sorry
that
you
feel
as
you
do
she
wrote
perhaps
unconsciously
using
henri
last
words
to
her
i
have
not
meant
to
be
cruel
and
if
you
were
here
you
would
realize
that
whether
others
could
have
done
what
i
am
doing
or
not
and
of
course
many
could
it
is
worth
doing
i
hear
that
other
women
are
establishing
houses
like
this
but
the
british
and
the
french
will
not
allow
women
so
near
the
lines
the
men
come
in
at
night
from
the
trenches
so
tired
so
hungry
and
so
cold
some
of
them
are
wounded
too
i
dress
the
little
wounds
i
do
give
them
something
harvey
dear
if
it
is
only
a
reminder
that
there
are
homes
in
the
world
and
everything
is
not
mud
and
waiting
and
killing
she
told
him
that
his
picture
was
on
her
mantel
but
she
did
not
say
that
a
corner
of
her
room
had
been
blown
away
or
that
the
mantel
was
but
a
plank
from
a
destroyed
house
and
she
sent
a
great
deal
of
love
but
she
did
not
say
that
she
no
longer
wore
his
ring
on
her
finger
and
of
course
she
was
coming
back
to
him
if
he
still
wanted
her
more
than
henri
absence
was
troubling
sara
lee
those
days
indeed
she
herself
laid
all
her
anxiety
to
one
thing
a
serious
one
at
that
with
all
the
marvels
of
henri
buying
and
jean
her
money
was
not
holding
out
the
scope
of
the
little
house
had
grown
with
its
fame
now
and
then
there
were
unexpected
calls
too
marie
mother
starving
in
havre
sickness
and
death
in
the
little
town
at
the
crossroads
a
dozen
small
emergencies
but
adding
to
the
demands
on
her
slender
income
she
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
already
begun
to
draw
on
her
private
capital
and
during
the
days
when
no
gray
car
appeared
she
faced
the
situation
took
stock
as
it
were
and
grew
and
wistful
on
the
fifth
day
the
gray
car
came
again
but
jean
drove
it
alone
he
disclaimed
any
need
for
sympathy
over
his
wound
and
with
rené
aid
carried
in
the
supplies
there
was
the
business
of
checking
them
off
and
the
further
business
of
sara
lee
paying
for
them
in
gold
she
sat
at
the
table
jean
across
and
struggled
with
centimes
and
francs
and
louis
an
engrossed
frown
between
her
eyebrows
jean
sitting
across
thought
her
rather
changed
she
smiled
very
seldom
and
her
eyes
were
perhaps
more
steady
it
was
a
young
girl
he
and
henri
had
brought
out
to
the
little
house
it
was
a
very
serious
and
rather
anxious
young
woman
who
sat
across
from
him
and
piled
up
the
money
he
had
brought
back
into
little
stacks
jean
she
said
finally
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
to
do
what
to
continue
here
no
you
see
i
had
a
little
money
of
my
own
and
twenty
pounds
i
got
in
london
you
and
and
henri
have
done
miracles
for
me
but
soon
i
shall
have
used
all
my
own
money
except
enough
to
take
me
back
and
now
i
shall
have
to
start
on
my
english
notes
after
that
you
are
too
good
to
the
men
these
cigarettes
now
you
could
do
without
them
but
they
are
very
cheap
and
they
mean
so
much
jean
she
sat
still
her
hands
before
her
on
the
table
from
the
kitchen
came
the
bubbling
of
the
eternal
soup
suddenly
a
tear
rolled
slowly
down
her
cheek
she
had
a
hatred
of
crying
in
public
but
jean
apparently
did
not
notice
the
trouble
mademoiselle
is
that
you
are
trying
to
feed
and
comfort
too
many
jean
she
said
suddenly
where
is
henri
in
england
i
think
the
only
clear
thought
in
sara
lee
mind
was
that
henri
was
not
in
france
and
that
he
had
gone
without
telling
her
she
had
hurt
him
horribly
she
knew
that
he
might
never
come
back
to
the
little
house
of
mercy
there
was
in
henri
for
all
his
joyousness
an
implacable
strain
and
she
had
attacked
his
honor
what
possible
right
had
she
to
do
that
the
memory
of
all
his
thoughtful
kindness
came
back
and
it
was
a
pale
and
distracted
sara
lee
who
looked
across
the
table
at
jean
did
he
tell
you
anything
nothing
mademoiselle
he
is
very
angry
with
me
jean
but
surely
no
mademoiselle
with
you
it
is
impossible
but
though
they
said
nothing
more
jean
considered
the
matter
deeply
he
understood
now
for
instance
a
certain
strangeness
in
henri
manner
before
his
departure
they
had
quarreled
these
two
perhaps
it
was
as
well
though
jean
was
by
now
a
convert
to
sara
lee
but
he
looked
out
those
days
on
but
half
a
world
did
jean
so
he
saw
only
the
woman
hunger
in
henri
and
nothing
deeper
and
in
sara
lee
a
woman
and
nothing
more
and
being
jean
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
they
fell
to
discussing
ways
and
means
the
chocolate
could
be
cut
out
but
not
the
cigarettes
sara
lee
arguing
vehemently
for
them
and
trying
to
forget
other
things
remembered
suddenly
how
uncle
james
had
hated
cigarettes
and
that
harvey
himself
disapproved
of
them
somehow
harvey
seemed
those
days
to
present
a
constant
figure
of
disapproval
he
gave
her
no
moral
support
at
jean
suggestion
she
added
to
her
report
of
so
many
men
fed
with
soup
so
much
tobacco
sort
not
specified
so
many
small
wounds
dressed
a
request
that
if
possible
her
allowance
be
increased
she
did
it
nervously
but
when
the
letter
had
gone
she
felt
a
great
relief
she
enclosed
a
snapshot
of
the
little
house
jean
as
it
happens
had
lied
about
henri
not
once
but
several
times
he
had
told
marie
for
instance
that
henri
was
in
england
and
later
on
he
told
rené
then
having
done
his
errand
he
drove
six
miles
back
along
the
main
road
to
dunkirk
and
picked
up
henri
who
was
sitting
on
the
bank
of
a
canal
watching
an
ammunition
train
go
by
jean
backed
into
a
lane
and
turned
the
car
round
after
that
henri
got
in
and
they
went
rapidly
back
toward
the
front
it
was
a
different
henri
however
who
left
the
car
a
mile
from
the
crossroads
a
henri
in
the
uniform
of
a
french
private
soldier
one
of
those
odd
and
impracticable
uniforms
of
france
during
the
first
year
baggy
dark
blue
trousers
stiff
cap
and
the
coat
its
skirts
turned
back
and
faced
round
his
neck
he
wore
a
knitted
scarf
which
covered
his
chin
and
true
to
the
instinct
of
the
french
peasant
in
a
winter
campaign
he
wore
innumerable
undergarments
the
red
of
a
jersey
showing
through
rents
in
his
coat
gone
were
henri
long
clean
lines
his
small
waist
and
broad
shoulders
the
swing
of
his
walk
instead
he
walked
with
the
swing
of
the
french
infantryman
that
tireless
but
awkward
marching
step
which
renders
the
french
army
so
mobile
he
carried
all
the
impedimenta
of
a
man
going
into
the
trenches
an
extra
jar
of
water
a
flat
loaf
of
bread
strapped
to
his
haversack
and
an
intrenching
tool
jingling
at
his
belt
even
jean
smiled
as
he
watched
him
moving
along
toward
the
crowded
crossroads
smiled
and
then
sighed
for
jean
had
lost
everything
in
the
war
his
wife
had
died
of
a
german
bullet
long
months
before
and
with
her
had
gone
a
child
much
prayed
for
and
soon
to
come
but
henri
had
brought
back
to
jean
something
to
live
for
or
to
die
for
as
might
happen
henri
walked
along
gayly
he
hailed
other
french
soldiers
he
joined
a
handful
and
stood
talking
to
them
but
he
reached
the
crossroads
before
the
ammunition
train
the
crossroads
was
crowded
as
usual
many
soldiers
at
rest
waiting
for
the
word
to
fall
in
a
battery
held
up
by
the
breaking
of
a
wheel
a
temporary
forge
had
been
set
up
and
soldiers
in
leather
aprons
were
working
over
the
fire
a
handful
of
peasants
watched
their
dull
eyes
following
every
gesture
and
one
of
them
was
a
man
henri
sought
henri
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
lighted
a
cigarette
the
ammunition
train
rolled
in
and
halted
and
the
man
henri
watched
turned
his
attention
to
the
train
he
had
been
dull
and
quiet
at
the
forge
but
now
he
became
smiling
a
good
fellow
he
found
a
man
he
knew
among
the
drivers
and
offered
him
a
cigarette
he
also
produced
and
presented
an
entire
box
of
matches
matches
were
very
dear
and
hardly
to
be
bought
at
any
price
henri
watched
grimly
and
hummed
a
little
song
la
la
çà
ne
va
la
la
çà
ne
va
still
humming
under
his
breath
when
the
peasant
left
the
crossroads
he
followed
him
not
closely
the
peasant
cut
across
the
fields
henri
followed
the
road
and
entered
the
fields
at
a
different
angle
he
knew
his
way
quite
well
for
he
had
done
the
same
thing
each
day
for
four
days
only
twice
he
had
been
a
belgian
peasant
and
once
he
was
an
officer
and
once
he
had
been
a
priest
four
days
he
had
done
this
thing
but
was
different
there
would
be
something
worth
while
he
fancied
and
he
made
a
mental
note
that
sara
lee
must
not
be
in
the
little
house
that
night
when
he
had
got
to
a
canal
where
the
pollard
willows
were
already
sending
out
their
tiny
red
buds
henri
sat
down
again
the
village
lay
before
him
desolate
and
ruined
a
travesty
of
homes
and
on
a
slight
rise
but
so
concealed
from
him
by
the
willows
that
only
the
great
wings
showed
stood
the
windmill
it
was
the
noon
respite
then
and
beyond
the
line
of
poplars
all
was
quiet
the
enemy
liked
time
for
foods
and
the
belgians
crippled
by
the
loss
of
that
earlier
train
were
husbanding
their
ammunition
far
away
a
gap
in
the
poplar
trees
showed
a
german
observation
balloon
a
tiny
dot
against
the
sky
the
man
henri
watched
went
slowly
for
he
carried
a
bag
of
grain
on
his
back
henri
no
longed
watched
him
he
watched
the
wind
wheel
it
had
been
broken
and
one
plane
was
now
patched
with
what
looked
like
a
red
cloth
there
was
a
good
wind
but
clearly
the
miller
was
idle
that
day
the
great
wings
were
not
turning
henri
sat
still
and
smoked
he
thought
of
many
things
of
sara
eyes
when
in
the
center
of
the
london
traffic
she
had
held
the
dying
donkey
of
her
small
and
radiant
figure
at
the
savoy
of
the
morning
he
had
found
her
at
calais
in
the
gare
maritime
quietly
unconscious
that
she
had
done
a
courageous
thing
and
he
thought
too
of
the
ring
and
the
photograph
she
carried
but
mostly
he
remembered
the
things
she
had
said
to
him
on
their
last
meeting
perhaps
there
came
to
him
his
temptation
too
it
would
be
so
easy
that
night
if
things
went
well
to
make
a
brave
showing
before
her
to
let
her
see
that
these
odd
jobs
he
did
had
their
value
and
their
risks
but
he
put
that
from
him
the
little
house
of
mercy
must
be
empty
that
night
for
her
sake
he
shivered
as
he
remembered
the
room
where
she
slept
the
corner
that
was
shot
away
and
left
open
to
the
street
so
he
sat
and
watched
and
at
one
the
mill
wheel
began
turning
it
was
easy
to
count
the
revolutions
by
the
red
wing
nine
times
it
turned
and
stopped
after
five
minutes
or
so
it
turned
again
thirty
times
henri
smiled
an
ugly
smile
a
good
guess
he
said
to
himself
but
it
must
be
more
than
a
guess
his
work
for
the
afternoon
was
done
still
with
the
swing
he
struck
back
to
the
road
and
avoiding
the
crossroads
went
across
more
fields
to
a
lane
where
jean
waited
with
the
car
henri
took
a
plunge
into
the
canal
when
he
had
removed
his
french
uniform
and
producing
a
towel
from
under
a
bush
rubbed
himself
dry
his
lean
boyish
body
gleamed
arms
and
legs
brown
from
much
swimming
under
peaceful
summer
suns
on
his
chest
he
showed
two
scars
still
pink
shrapnel
bites
he
called
them
but
he
had
it
is
to
be
feared
a
certain
young
satisfaction
in
them
he
was
in
high
good
humor
the
water
was
icy
and
jean
had
refused
to
join
him
my
passion
for
cleanliness
henri
said
blithely
is
the
result
of
my
english
school
days
you
would
have
been
the
better
for
an
english
education
jean
a
canal
in
march
jean
grunted
you
will
end
badly
henri
looked
longingly
at
the
water
had
i
a
dry
towel
he
said
i
would
go
in
again
jean
looked
at
him
with
his
one
eye
you
would
be
prettier
without
those
scars
he
observed
but
in
his
heart
he
prayed
that
there
might
be
no
others
added
to
them
that
nothing
might
mar
or
destroy
that
bright
and
youthful
body
vous
sommes
he
added
but
henri
was
minded
to
play
he
girded
himself
with
the
towel
and
struck
an
attitude
the
russian
ballet
jean
he
said
and
capering
madly
sent
jean
into
deep
grumbles
of
laughter
by
his
burlesque
i
must
have
exercise
henri
said
at
last
when
breathless
and
with
flying
hair
he
began
to
dress
that
too
is
my
english
schooling
if
you
jean
to
the
devil
with
your
english
schooling
jean
remonstrated
henri
sobered
quickly
after
that
the
exhilaration
of
his
cold
plunge
was
over
the
american
lady
he
asked
she
is
all
right
she
is
worried
there
is
not
enough
money
henri
frowned
and
i
have
nothing
this
opened
up
an
old
wound
with
jean
if
you
would
be
practical
and
take
pay
for
what
you
are
doing
he
began
henri
cut
him
short
pay
he
said
what
is
there
to
pay
me
with
and
what
is
the
use
of
reopening
the
matter
a
man
may
be
a
spy
for
love
of
his
country
god
knows
there
is
enough
lying
and
deceit
in
the
business
but
to
be
a
spy
for
money
never
there
was
a
little
silence
then
now
for
mademoiselle
said
henri
she
must
be
out
of
the
village
and
that
dear
friend
must
be
your
affair
she
does
not
like
me
all
the
life
had
gone
out
of
his
voice
xv
but
why
should
i
go
sara
lee
asked
it
is
kind
of
you
to
ask
me
jean
but
i
am
here
to
work
not
to
play
long
ago
sara
lee
had
abandoned
her
idea
of
jean
as
a
paid
chauffeur
she
even
surmised
from
something
marie
had
said
that
he
had
been
a
person
of
importance
in
the
belgium
of
before
the
war
so
she
was
grateful
but
inclined
to
be
obstinate
you
have
been
so
much
alone
mademoiselle
alone
cut
off
from
your
own
kind
and
now
and
then
one
finds
at
the
hotel
in
dunkirk
some
english
nurses
who
are
having
a
holiday
you
would
like
to
talk
to
them
perhaps
jean
she
said
unexpectedly
why
do
you
tell
me
the
truth
you
want
me
to
leave
the
village
why
because
mademoiselle
there
will
be
a
bombardment
the
village
itself
we
expect
it
he
answered
dryly
sara
lee
went
a
little
pale
but
then
i
shall
be
needed
as
i
was
before
no
troops
will
pass
through
the
town
they
will
take
a
road
beyond
the
fields
how
do
you
know
these
things
she
asked
wondering
about
the
troops
i
can
understand
but
the
bombardment
there
are
ways
of
finding
out
mademoiselle
he
replied
in
his
noncommittal
voice
now
will
you
go
may
i
tell
marie
and
rené
no
then
i
shall
not
go
how
can
you
think
that
i
would
consider
my
own
safety
and
leave
them
here
jean
had
ascertained
before
speaking
that
marie
was
not
in
the
house
as
for
rené
he
sat
on
the
single
doorstep
and
whittled
pegs
on
which
to
hang
his
rifle
inside
the
door
and
as
he
carved
he
sang
words
of
his
own
to
the
tune
of
tipperary
inside
the
little
à
jean
reassured
sara
lee
it
was
important
vital
that
rené
and
marie
should
not
know
far
in
advance
of
the
bombardment
they
were
loyal
certainly
but
these
were
his
orders
in
abundance
of
time
they
would
be
warned
to
leave
the
village
who
is
to
warn
them
henri
has
promised
mademoiselle
and
what
he
promises
is
done
you
said
this
morning
that
he
was
in
england
he
has
returned
sara
lee
heart
which
had
been
going
along
merely
as
a
matter
of
duty
all
day
suddenly
began
to
beat
faster
her
color
came
up
and
then
faded
again
he
had
returned
and
he
had
not
come
to
the
little
house
but
then
what
could
henri
mean
to
her
his
coming
or
his
going
was
she
to
add
to
her
other
sins
against
harvey
the
supreme
one
of
being
interested
in
henri
not
that
she
said
all
that
even
to
herself
there
was
a
wave
of
gladness
and
then
a
surge
of
remorse
that
is
all
but
it
was
a
very
sober
sara
lee
who
put
on
her
black
suit
with
the
white
collar
that
afternoon
and
ordered
by
jean
suggestion
the
evening
preparations
as
though
nothing
was
to
happen
she
looked
round
her
little
room
before
she
left
it
it
might
not
be
there
when
she
returned
so
she
placed
harvey
photograph
under
her
mattress
for
safety
and
rather
uncomfortably
she
laid
beside
it
the
small
ivory
crucifix
that
henri
had
found
in
a
ruined
house
and
brought
to
her
harvey
was
not
a
catholic
he
did
not
believe
in
visualizing
his
religion
and
she
had
a
distinct
impression
that
he
considered
such
things
as
did
so
as
bordering
on
idolatry
sometime
after
dusk
that
evening
the
ammunition
train
moved
out
at
a
point
a
mile
or
so
from
the
village
a
dispatch
rider
on
a
motor
cycle
stopped
the
rumbling
lorry
at
the
head
of
the
procession
and
delivered
a
message
which
the
guide
read
by
the
light
of
a
sheltered
match
the
train
moved
on
but
it
did
not
turn
down
to
the
village
it
went
beyond
to
a
place
of
safety
and
there
remained
for
the
night
but
before
that
time
henri
lying
close
in
a
field
had
seen
a
skulking
figure
run
from
the
road
to
the
mill
and
soon
after
had
seen
the
mill
wheel
turn
once
describing
a
great
arc
and
on
one
of
the
wings
showing
only
toward
the
poplar
trees
was
a
lighted
lantern
five
minutes
later
exactly
time
enough
for
the
train
to
have
reached
the
village
street
german
shells
began
to
fall
in
it
henri
lying
flat
on
the
ground
swore
silently
and
deeply
in
every
land
during
this
war
there
have
been
those
who
would
sell
their
country
for
a
price
sometimes
money
sometimes
protection
and
of
all
betrayals
that
of
the
man
who
sells
his
own
country
is
the
most
dastardly
henri
lying
face
down
bit
the
grass
beneath
him
in
sheer
rage
one
thing
he
had
not
counted
on
he
who
foresaw
most
things
the
miller
and
his
son
being
what
they
were
were
cowards
as
well
doubtless
the
mill
had
been
promised
protection
it
was
too
valuable
to
the
germans
to
be
destroyed
but
with
the
first
shot
both
men
left
the
house
by
the
mill
and
scurried
like
rabbits
for
the
open
fields
maurice
poor
marie
lover
by
now
almost
trampled
on
henri
prostrate
body
and
henri
was
alone
and
his
work
was
to
take
them
alive
they
had
information
he
must
have
how
the
had
been
arranged
through
what
channels
and
under
suitable
treatment
they
would
tell
he
could
not
follow
them
through
the
fields
he
lay
still
during
a
fiercer
bombardment
than
the
one
before
raising
his
head
now
and
then
to
see
if
the
little
house
of
mercy
still
stood
no
shells
came
his
way
but
the
sky
line
of
the
village
altered
quickly
the
standing
fragment
of
the
church
towers
went
early
there
was
much
sound
of
falling
masonry
from
somewhere
behind
him
a
belgian
battery
gave
tongue
but
not
for
long
and
then
came
silence
henri
moved
then
he
crept
nearer
the
mill
and
nearer
and
at
last
he
stood
inside
and
took
his
bearings
a
lamp
burned
in
the
kitchen
showing
a
dirty
brick
floor
and
a
littered
table
such
a
house
as
men
keep
untidy
and
unhomelike
a
burnt
kettle
stood
on
the
hearth
and
leaning
against
the
wall
was
the
bag
of
grain
maurice
had
carried
from
the
crossroads
a
mill
which
grinds
without
grain
henri
said
to
himself
there
was
a
staircase
to
the
upper
floor
and
there
with
the
door
slightly
ajar
he
stationed
himself
pistol
in
hand
now
and
then
he
glanced
uneasily
at
the
clock
sara
lee
must
not
be
back
before
he
had
taken
his
prisoners
to
the
little
house
and
turned
them
over
to
those
who
waited
there
there
were
footsteps
outside
and
henri
drew
the
door
a
little
closer
but
he
was
dismayed
to
find
it
marie
she
crept
in
a
white
and
broken
thing
and
looked
about
her
maurice
she
called
she
sat
down
for
a
moment
and
then
seeing
the
disorder
about
her
set
to
work
to
clear
the
table
it
was
then
that
henri
lowered
his
pistol
and
opened
the
door
do
shriek
marie
he
said
she
turned
and
saw
him
and
clutched
at
the
table
monsieur
marie
he
said
quietly
go
up
these
stairs
and
remain
quiet
do
not
walk
round
and
do
not
come
down
no
matter
what
you
hear
she
obeyed
him
stumbling
somewhat
for
she
had
seen
his
revolver
and
it
frightened
her
but
as
she
passed
him
she
clutched
at
his
sleeve
he
is
good
maurice
she
said
gasping
of
the
father
i
know
nothing
but
maurice
go
up
and
be
silent
was
all
he
said
now
by
all
that
goes
to
make
a
story
sara
lee
should
have
met
mabel
at
the
hôtel
des
arcades
in
dunkirk
and
should
have
been
able
to
make
that
efficient
young
woman
burn
with
jealousy
mabel
who
from
the
safety
of
her
hospital
in
boulogne
considered
dunkirk
the
front
indeed
sara
lee
to
whom
the
world
was
beginning
to
seem
very
small
had
had
some
such
faint
hope
but
mabel
was
not
there
and
it
was
not
until
long
after
that
they
met
at
all
and
then
only
when
the
lights
had
gone
down
and
sara
lee
was
again
knitting
by
the
fire
there
were
a
few
nurses
there
in
their
white
veils
with
the
red
cross
over
the
forehead
and
one
or
two
englishwomen
in
hats
that
sat
a
trifle
too
high
on
the
tops
of
their
heads
and
with
long
lists
before
them
which
they
checked
as
they
ate
aviators
in
leather
coats
a
few
spahis
in
cloak
and
turban
with
bloomers
and
high
boots
some
american
ambulance
drivers
rather
noisy
and
very
young
and
many
officers
in
every
uniform
of
the
allied
armies
sat
at
food
together
and
for
a
time
forgot
their
anxieties
under
the
influence
of
lights
food
and
warmth
and
red
and
white
wine
mixed
with
water
when
he
chose
jean
could
be
a
delightful
companion
not
with
lift
of
spirits
but
quietly
interesting
and
that
evening
he
was
a
new
jean
to
sara
lee
a
man
of
the
world
talking
of
world
affairs
he
found
her
apt
and
intelligent
and
for
sara
lee
much
that
had
been
clouded
cleared
up
forever
that
night
until
then
she
had
known
only
the
humanities
of
the
war
or
its
inhumanities
there
over
that
little
table
she
learned
something
of
its
politics
and
its
inevitability
she
had
been
working
in
the
dark
with
her
heart
only
now
she
began
to
grasp
the
real
significance
of
it
all
of
belgium
anxiety
for
many
years
of
germany
cold
and
cruel
preparation
and
empty
protests
of
friendship
she
learned
of
the
flight
of
the
government
from
brussels
the
most
important
state
papers
being
taken
away
in
a
hand
cart
on
top
of
which
at
the
last
moment
some
flustered
official
had
placed
a
tall
silk
hat
she
learned
of
the
failure
of
great
fortifications
before
the
invaders
heavy
guns
and
he
had
drawn
for
her
such
a
picture
of
albert
of
belgium
as
she
was
never
to
forget
perhaps
sara
lee
real
growth
began
that
night
over
that
simple
dinner
at
the
hôtel
des
arcades
i
wish
she
said
at
last
that
uncle
james
could
have
heard
all
this
he
was
always
so
puzzled
about
it
all
and
you
make
it
so
clear
when
dinner
was
over
a
bit
of
tension
had
relaxed
in
her
somewhat
she
had
been
too
close
for
too
long
and
when
a
group
of
belgian
officers
learning
who
she
was
asked
to
be
presented
and
gravely
thanked
her
she
flushed
with
happiness
we
must
see
if
mademoiselle
shall
not
have
a
medal
said
the
only
one
who
spoke
english
a
medal
for
what
for
courage
he
said
bowing
belgium
has
little
to
give
but
it
can
at
least
do
honor
to
a
brave
lady
jean
was
smiling
when
they
passed
on
what
a
story
would
this
slip
of
a
girl
take
home
with
her
but
i
do
think
i
want
a
medal
jean
she
said
i
did
come
for
that
and
after
all
it
is
you
and
henri
who
have
done
the
thing
not
i
accustomed
to
women
of
a
more
sophisticated
class
jean
had
at
first
taken
her
naïveté
for
the
height
of
subtlety
he
was
always
expecting
her
to
betray
herself
but
after
that
evening
with
her
he
changed
just
such
simplicity
had
been
his
wife
sometimes
sara
lee
reminded
him
of
her
the
upraising
of
her
eyes
or
an
unstudied
gesture
he
sighed
you
are
very
wonderful
you
americans
he
said
it
was
the
nearest
to
a
compliment
that
he
had
ever
come
and
after
that
evening
he
was
always
very
gentle
with
her
once
he
had
protected
her
because
henri
had
asked
him
to
do
so
now
he
himself
became
in
his
silent
way
her
protector
the
ride
home
through
the
dark
was
very
quiet
sara
lee
sat
beside
him
watching
the
stars
and
growing
increasingly
anxious
as
they
went
not
too
rapidly
toward
the
little
house
there
were
no
lights
air
raids
had
grown
common
in
dunkirk
and
there
were
no
street
lights
in
the
little
city
once
on
the
highway
jean
lighted
the
lamps
but
left
them
very
low
and
two
miles
from
the
little
house
he
put
them
out
altogether
they
traveled
by
starlight
then
following
as
best
they
could
the
tall
trees
that
marked
the
road
now
and
then
they
went
astray
at
that
and
once
they
tilted
into
the
ditch
and
had
hard
pulling
to
get
out
at
the
top
of
the
street
jean
stopped
and
went
on
foot
a
little
way
down
he
came
back
with
the
report
that
new
shells
had
made
the
way
impassable
and
again
sara
lee
shivered
if
the
little
house
was
gone
but
it
was
there
and
lighted
too
through
its
broken
shutters
came
the
yellow
glow
of
the
oil
lamp
that
now
hung
over
the
table
in
the
à
whatever
jean
anxieties
had
been
fell
from
him
as
he
pushed
open
the
door
henri
voice
was
the
first
thing
they
heard
he
was
too
much
occupied
to
notice
their
approach
so
it
was
that
sara
lee
saw
for
the
last
time
the
miller
and
his
son
maurice
saw
them
but
did
not
know
them
for
over
their
heads
were
bags
of
their
own
sacking
with
eyeholes
roughly
cut
in
them
their
hands
were
bound
and
three
soldiers
were
waiting
to
take
them
away
i
have
covered
your
heads
henri
was
saying
in
french
because
it
is
not
well
that
our
brave
belgians
should
know
that
they
have
been
betrayed
by
those
of
their
own
number
it
was
a
cold
and
terrible
henri
who
spoke
take
them
away
he
said
to
the
waiting
men
a
few
moments
later
he
turned
from
the
door
and
heard
sara
lee
sobbing
in
her
room
he
tapped
and
on
receiving
no
reply
he
went
in
the
room
was
unharmed
and
by
the
light
of
a
candle
he
saw
the
girl
face
down
on
the
bed
he
spoke
to
her
but
she
only
lay
crouched
deeper
her
shoulders
shaking
it
is
war
mademoiselle
he
said
and
went
closer
then
suddenly
all
the
hurt
of
the
past
days
all
the
bitterness
of
the
last
hour
were
lost
in
an
overwhelming
burst
of
tenderness
he
bent
over
her
and
put
his
arms
round
her
that
i
should
have
hurt
you
so
he
said
softly
i
who
would
die
for
you
mademoiselle
i
who
worship
you
he
buried
his
face
in
the
warm
hollow
of
her
neck
and
held
her
close
he
was
trembling
i
love
you
he
whispered
i
love
you
she
quieted
under
his
touch
he
was
very
strong
and
there
was
refuge
in
his
arms
for
a
moment
she
lay
still
happier
than
she
had
been
for
weeks
it
was
henri
who
was
shaken
now
and
the
girl
who
was
still
but
very
soon
came
the
thing
that
after
all
he
expected
she
drew
herself
away
from
him
and
henri
sensitive
to
every
gesture
stood
back
who
are
they
was
the
first
thing
she
said
it
rather
stabbed
him
he
had
just
told
her
that
he
loved
her
and
never
before
in
his
careless
young
life
had
he
said
that
to
any
woman
spies
he
said
briefly
a
flushed
and
tearful
sara
lee
stood
up
then
and
looked
up
at
him
gravely
then
that
is
what
you
do
yes
mademoiselle
quite
suddenly
she
went
to
him
and
held
up
her
face
please
kiss
me
henri
she
said
very
simply
i
have
been
cruel
and
stupid
and
but
he
had
her
in
his
arms
then
and
he
drew
her
close
as
though
he
would
never
let
her
go
he
was
one
great
burst
of
joy
poor
henri
but
when
she
gently
freed
herself
at
last
it
was
to
deliver
what
seemed
for
a
time
his
death
wound
you
have
paid
me
a
great
tribute
she
said
still
simply
and
gravely
i
wanted
you
to
kiss
me
because
of
what
you
said
but
that
will
have
to
be
all
henri
dear
all
he
said
blankly
you
have
forgotten
have
you
i
i
am
engaged
to
somebody
else
henri
stood
still
swaying
a
little
and
you
love
him
more
than
you
care
for
me
he
is
he
is
my
kind
said
sara
lee
rather
pitifully
i
am
not
what
you
think
me
you
see
me
here
doing
what
you
think
is
good
work
and
you
are
grateful
and
you
do
see
any
other
women
so
i
and
you
think
i
love
you
because
i
see
no
one
else
he
demanded
still
rather
stunned
is
that
part
of
it
he
flung
out
his
hands
as
though
he
despaired
of
making
her
understand
this
man
at
home
he
said
bitterly
this
man
who
loves
you
so
well
that
he
let
you
cross
the
sea
and
come
here
alone
do
you
love
him
very
dearly
i
am
promised
to
him
all
at
once
sara
lee
saw
the
little
parlor
at
home
and
harvey
gentle
rather
stolid
and
dependable
oh
very
dependable
she
saw
him
as
he
had
looked
the
night
he
had
said
he
loved
her
rather
wistful
and
very
very
tender
she
could
not
hurt
him
so
she
had
said
she
was
going
back
to
him
and
she
must
go
i
love
him
very
much
henri
very
quietly
considering
the
hell
that
was
raging
in
him
henri
bent
over
and
kissed
her
hand
then
he
turned
it
over
and
for
an
instant
he
held
his
cheek
against
its
warmth
he
went
out
at
once
and
sara
lee
heard
the
door
slam
illustration
that
i
should
have
hurt
you
so
he
said
softly
xvi
time
passed
quickly
as
always
it
does
when
there
is
work
to
do
round
the
ruined
houses
the
gray
grass
turned
green
again
and
in
travesties
of
gardens
early
spring
flowers
began
to
show
a
touch
of
color
the
first
of
them
greeted
sara
lee
one
morning
as
she
stood
on
her
doorstep
in
the
early
sun
she
gathered
them
and
placed
them
one
on
each
grave
in
the
cemetery
near
the
poplar
trees
where
small
wooden
crosses
sometimes
surmounted
by
a
cap
marked
many
graves
marie
a
silent
subdued
marie
worked
steadily
in
the
little
house
she
did
not
weep
but
now
and
then
sara
lee
found
her
stirring
something
on
the
stove
and
looking
toward
the
quiet
mill
in
the
fields
and
once
sara
lee
surprising
that
look
on
her
face
put
her
arms
about
the
girl
and
held
her
for
a
moment
but
she
did
not
say
anything
there
was
nothing
to
say
with
the
opening
up
of
the
spring
came
increased
movement
and
activity
among
the
troops
the
beach
and
the
sand
dunes
round
la
panne
were
filled
with
drilling
men
belgium
new
army
veterans
of
the
winter
at
rest
behind
the
lines
sat
in
the
sun
and
pared
potatoes
for
the
midday
meal
convalescents
from
the
hospital
appeared
in
motley
garments
from
the
ambulance
ocean
and
walked
along
the
water
front
where
the
sea
no
longer
gray
and
sullen
rolled
up
in
thin
white
lines
of
foam
to
their
very
feet
winter
straw
came
out
of
wooden
sabots
hands
turned
soft
canal
boats
blossomed
out
with
great
washings
and
the
sentry
at
the
gun
emplacement
in
the
sand
up
the
beach
gave
over
gathering
sticks
for
his
fire
and
lay
when
no
one
was
about
in
a
hollow
in
the
dune
face
to
the
sky
so
spring
came
to
that
small
fragment
of
belgium
which
had
been
saved
spring
and
hope
soon
now
the
great
and
powerful
allies
would
drive
out
the
huns
and
all
would
be
as
it
had
been
splendid
rumors
were
about
the
germans
were
already
yielding
at
la
bassée
there
was
to
be
a
great
drive
along
the
entire
front
and
hopefully
one
would
return
home
in
time
for
the
spring
planting
a
sort
of
informal
council
took
place
occasionally
in
the
little
house
maps
replaced
the
dressings
on
the
table
in
the
à
and
junior
officers
armed
with
sara
lee
box
of
pins
thrust
back
the
enemy
at
various
points
and
proved
conclusively
that
his
position
was
untenable
they
celebrated
these
paper
victories
with
sara
lee
tea
and
went
away
the
better
for
an
hour
or
so
of
hope
and
tea
and
a
soft
voice
and
quiet
eyes
now
and
then
there
was
one
of
course
who
lagged
behind
his
fellows
with
a
yearning
tenderness
in
his
face
that
a
glance
from
the
girl
would
have
quickly
turned
to
love
but
sara
lee
had
no
coquetry
when
as
occasionally
happened
there
was
a
bit
too
much
fervor
when
her
hand
was
kissed
she
laid
it
where
it
belonged
to
loneliness
and
the
spring
and
became
extremely
maternal
and
very
very
kind
which
both
of
them
are
death
blows
to
young
love
the
winter
floods
were
receding
along
the
yser
canal
flats
began
to
appear
with
here
and
there
rusty
tangles
of
barbed
wire
and
with
the
lessening
of
the
flood
came
new
activities
to
the
little
house
the
spring
drive
was
coming
there
was
spring
indeed
everywhere
but
in
henri
heart
day
after
day
messages
were
left
with
sara
lee
by
men
in
uniform
sometimes
letters
sometimes
a
word
and
these
she
faithfully
cared
for
until
such
time
as
jean
came
for
them
now
and
then
it
was
henri
who
came
but
when
he
stayed
in
the
village
he
made
his
headquarters
at
the
house
of
the
mill
there
with
sacking
over
the
windows
he
wrote
his
reports
by
lamplight
reports
which
jean
carried
back
to
the
villa
in
the
fishing
village
by
the
sea
however
though
he
no
longer
came
and
went
as
before
henri
made
frequent
calls
at
the
house
of
mercy
but
now
he
came
in
the
evenings
when
the
place
was
full
of
men
sara
lee
was
doing
more
dressings
than
before
the
of
winter
was
over
and
there
were
nights
when
a
row
of
wounded
men
lay
on
the
floor
in
the
little
à
and
waited
in
a
sort
of
dreadful
quiet
to
be
taken
away
rumors
came
of
hard
fighting
farther
along
the
line
and
sometimes
on
nights
when
the
clouds
hung
low
the
flashes
of
the
guns
at
ypres
looked
like
incessant
lightning
from
the
sand
dunes
at
nieuport
and
dixmude
there
was
firing
also
and
the
air
seemed
sometimes
to
be
full
of
scouting
planes
the
canadians
were
moving
toward
the
front
at
neuve
chapelle
at
that
time
and
one
day
a
lorry
piled
high
with
boxes
rolled
and
thumped
down
the
street
and
halted
by
rené
rather
think
we
are
lost
explained
the
driver
grinning
sheepishly
at
rené
there
were
four
boys
in
khaki
on
the
truck
and
not
a
word
of
french
among
them
sara
lee
who
rolled
her
own
bandages
now
heard
the
speech
and
came
out
good
gracious
she
said
and
gave
an
alarmed
glance
at
the
sky
but
it
was
the
noon
hour
when
every
good
german
abandons
war
for
food
and
the
sky
was
empty
the
boys
cheered
perceptibly
here
was
at
last
some
one
who
spoke
a
christian
tongue
must
have
taken
the
wrong
turning
miss
said
one
of
them
saluting
where
do
you
want
to
go
she
asked
you
are
very
close
to
the
belgian
front
here
it
is
not
at
all
safe
they
all
saluted
then
staring
at
her
curiously
told
her
dear
me
said
sara
lee
you
are
a
long
way
off
and
a
long
way
from
home
too
they
smiled
they
looked
with
their
faces
absurdly
young
after
the
bearded
belgian
soldiers
i
am
an
american
too
said
sara
lee
with
just
a
touch
of
homesickness
in
her
voice
she
had
been
feeling
lonely
lately
if
you
have
time
to
come
in
i
could
give
you
luncheon
rené
can
tell
us
if
any
german
air
machines
come
over
would
they
come
in
indeed
yes
they
crawled
down
off
the
lorry
and
took
off
their
caps
and
ate
every
particle
of
food
in
the
house
and
though
they
were
mutely
curious
at
first
soon
they
were
asking
questions
how
long
had
she
been
there
what
did
she
do
was
it
dangerous
not
so
dangerous
as
it
looks
said
sara
lee
smiling
the
germans
seldom
bother
the
town
now
it
is
not
worth
while
later
on
they
went
over
the
house
they
climbed
the
broken
staircase
and
stared
toward
the
break
in
the
poplar
trees
from
the
roofless
floor
above
some
girl
one
of
them
said
in
an
undertone
the
others
were
gazing
intently
toward
the
front
never
before
had
they
been
so
close
never
had
they
seen
a
ruined
town
war
until
now
had
been
a
thing
of
valcartier
of
a
long
voyage
of
much
drill
in
the
mud
at
salisbury
plain
now
here
they
saw
at
their
feet
what
war
could
do
damn
them
said
one
of
the
boys
suddenly
fellows
we
get
back
at
them
soon
so
they
went
away
a
trifle
silent
and
very
grateful
but
before
they
left
they
had
a
glimpse
of
sara
lee
room
with
the
corner
gone
and
harvey
picture
on
the
mantel
some
girl
they
repeated
as
they
drove
up
the
street
it
was
the
tribute
of
inarticulate
youth
sara
lee
went
back
to
her
bandages
and
her
thoughts
she
had
not
a
great
deal
of
time
to
think
what
with
the
officers
stopping
in
to
fight
their
battles
and
with
letters
to
write
and
dressings
to
make
and
supplies
to
order
she
began
to
have
many
visitors
officers
from
the
french
lines
correspondents
on
tours
of
the
front
and
once
even
an
english
cabinet
member
who
took
six
precious
lumps
of
sugar
in
his
tea
and
dug
a
piece
of
shell
out
of
the
wall
with
his
pocketknife
as
a
souvenir
once
a
british
aviator
brought
his
machine
down
in
the
field
by
the
mill
and
walked
over
with
the
stiff
stride
of
a
man
who
has
been
for
hours
in
the
air
she
gave
him
tea
and
bread
and
butter
and
she
learned
then
of
the
big
fighting
that
was
to
come
when
she
was
alone
she
thought
about
henri
generally
her
thoughts
were
tender
always
they
were
grateful
but
she
was
greatly
puzzled
he
had
said
that
he
loved
her
then
if
he
loved
her
why
should
he
not
be
gentle
and
kind
to
her
men
did
not
hurt
the
women
they
loved
and
because
she
was
hurt
she
was
rather
less
than
just
he
had
not
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
had
said
that
he
loved
her
but
that
was
different
and
the
insidious
poison
of
harvey
letter
about
foreigners
began
to
have
its
effect
the
truth
was
that
she
was
tired
the
strain
was
telling
on
her
and
at
a
time
when
she
needed
every
moral
support
henri
had
drawn
off
behind
a
wall
of
misery
and
all
her
efforts
at
a
renewal
of
their
old
friendship
only
brought
up
against
a
sort
of
stony
despair
there
were
times
too
when
she
grew
a
little
frightened
she
was
so
alone
what
if
henri
went
away
altogether
what
if
he
took
away
the
little
car
and
his
protection
and
the
supplies
that
came
so
regularly
it
was
not
a
selfish
fear
it
was
for
her
work
that
she
trembled
for
the
first
time
she
realized
her
complete
dependence
on
his
good
will
and
now
and
then
she
felt
that
it
would
be
good
to
see
harvey
again
and
be
safe
from
all
worry
and
not
have
to
depend
on
a
man
who
loved
her
as
henri
did
for
that
she
never
doubted
inexperienced
as
she
was
in
such
matters
she
knew
that
the
boy
loved
her
just
how
wildly
she
did
not
know
until
later
too
late
to
undo
what
the
madness
had
done
then
one
day
a
strange
thing
happened
it
had
been
raining
and
when
in
the
late
afternoon
the
sun
came
out
it
gleamed
in
the
puddles
that
filled
the
shell
holes
in
the
road
and
set
to
a
red
blaze
the
windows
of
the
house
of
the
mill
first
soaring
overhead
came
a
half
dozen
friendly
planes
next
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
having
thus
been
blinded
so
to
speak
there
came
a
regiment
of
fresh
troops
swinging
down
the
street
for
all
the
world
as
though
the
german
army
was
safely
drinking
beer
in
munich
they
passed
rené
standing
in
the
doorway
and
one
wag
of
a
belgian
boy
out
of
sheer
joy
of
spring
did
the
goose
step
as
he
passed
the
little
sentry
and
head
screwed
round
in
the
german
salute
crossed
his
eyes
over
his
impudent
nose
came
then
the
planes
came
the
regiment
which
turned
off
into
a
field
and
there
spread
itself
like
a
snake
uncoiling
into
a
double
line
came
a
machine
gray
and
battered
containing
officers
came
a
general
with
gold
braid
on
his
shoulder
and
a
pleasant
smile
came
the
strange
event
the
general
found
sara
lee
in
the
à
cutting
cotton
into
squares
and
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
bowed
profoundly
mademoiselle
kennedy
he
inquired
sara
lee
replied
to
that
and
then
gave
a
quick
thought
to
her
larder
because
generals
usually
meant
tea
but
this
time
at
last
sara
lee
was
to
receive
something
not
to
give
she
turned
very
white
when
she
was
told
and
said
she
had
not
deserved
it
she
was
indeed
on
the
verge
of
declining
not
knowing
that
there
are
certain
things
one
does
not
decline
but
marie
brought
her
hat
and
jacket
a
smiling
tremulous
marie
and
sara
lee
put
them
on
the
general
was
very
tall
in
her
short
skirt
and
with
flying
hair
she
looked
like
a
child
beside
him
as
they
walked
across
the
fields
suddenly
sara
lee
was
terribly
afraid
she
was
going
to
cry
the
troops
stood
rigidly
at
attention
and
a
cold
wind
flapped
sara
lee
skirts
and
the
guns
hammered
at
ypres
and
the
general
blew
on
his
fingers
and
soon
a
low
open
car
came
down
the
street
and
the
king
got
out
sara
lee
watched
him
coming
his
tall
slightly
stooped
figure
his
fair
hair
his
plain
blue
uniform
sara
lee
had
never
seen
a
king
before
and
she
had
always
thought
of
them
as
sitting
up
on
a
sort
of
platform
never
as
trudging
through
spring
mud
what
shall
i
do
she
asked
nervously
he
will
shake
hands
mademoiselle
bow
as
he
approaches
that
is
all
the
amazing
interlude
indeed
with
sara
lee
being
decorated
by
the
king
and
troops
drawn
up
to
do
her
honor
and
over
all
the
rumbling
of
the
great
guns
a
palpitating
and
dazed
sara
lee
when
the
decoration
was
fastened
to
her
black
jacket
a
sara
lee
whose
hat
blew
off
at
exactly
the
worst
moment
and
rolled
end
on
like
a
hoop
into
a
puddle
but
oddly
she
did
not
mind
about
the
hat
she
had
only
one
conscious
thought
just
then
she
hoped
that
wherever
uncle
james
might
be
in
that
world
of
the
gone
before
he
might
know
what
was
happening
to
her
or
even
see
it
he
would
have
liked
it
he
had
believed
in
the
belgians
and
in
the
king
and
now
the
king
did
not
go
at
once
he
went
back
to
the
little
house
and
went
through
it
and
he
and
one
of
his
generals
climbed
to
the
upper
floor
and
the
king
stood
looking
out
silently
toward
the
land
he
loved
and
which
for
a
time
was
no
longer
his
he
came
down
after
a
time
stooping
his
tall
figure
in
the
low
doorway
and
said
he
would
like
some
tea
so
marie
put
the
kettle
on
and
sara
lee
and
the
king
talked
it
was
all
rather
dazing
every
now
and
then
she
forgot
certain
instructions
whispered
her
by
the
general
and
after
a
time
the
king
said
why
do
you
do
that
mademoiselle
for
sara
lee
with
an
intent
face
and
moving
lips
had
been
stepping
backward
sara
lee
flushed
to
the
eyes
because
sire
i
was
told
to
remain
at
a
distance
of
six
feet
but
we
are
being
informal
said
the
king
smiling
and
it
is
a
very
little
room
sara
lee
who
had
been
taught
in
the
schoolroom
that
kings
are
usurpers
of
the
divine
rights
of
the
people
sara
lee
lost
just
a
bit
of
her
staunch
democracy
that
day
she
saw
the
king
of
the
belgians
for
what
he
really
was
a
ruler
but
a
symbol
as
well
he
represented
his
country
as
the
flag
she
loved
represented
hers
the
flag
was
america
the
king
was
belgium
that
was
all
it
was
a
very
humble
and
flushed
sara
lee
who
watched
the
gray
car
go
flying
up
the
street
later
on
she
went
in
and
told
the
whole
story
to
harvey
picture
but
it
was
difficult
to
feel
that
he
was
hearing
his
eyes
were
turned
away
and
his
face
was
set
and
stern
and
at
last
she
gave
it
up
this
thing
which
meant
so
much
to
her
would
never
mean
anything
to
harvey
she
knew
even
then
what
he
would
say
decorate
you
i
should
think
they
might
medals
are
cheap
everybody
over
there
is
getting
medals
you
feed
their
men
and
risk
your
life
and
your
reputation
and
they
give
you
a
thing
to
pin
on
it
cheap
at
the
price
and
later
on
those
were
harvey
very
words
but
to
be
fair
to
him
they
were
but
the
sloughing
of
a
wound
that
would
not
heal
that
evening
henri
came
again
he
was
for
the
first
time
his
gay
self
again
at
least
on
the
surface
it
was
as
though
knowing
what
he
was
going
into
he
would
leave
with
sara
lee
no
feeling
if
he
never
returned
that
she
had
inflicted
a
lasting
hurt
he
was
everywhere
in
the
little
house
elbowing
his
way
among
the
men
with
his
cheery
nonsense
bantering
the
weary
ones
until
they
smiled
carrying
hot
water
for
sara
lee
and
helping
her
now
and
then
with
a
bad
dressing
if
you
would
do
it
in
this
fashion
mademoiselle
he
would
say
with
one
turn
of
the
bandage
over
the
elbow
but
it
wo
hold
that
way
you
say
that
to
me
mademoiselle
i
who
have
taught
you
all
you
know
of
bandaging
they
would
wrangle
a
bit
and
end
by
doing
it
in
sara
lee
way
he
had
a
fund
of
nonsense
that
he
drew
on
too
when
a
dressing
was
painful
it
would
run
like
this
to
an
early
accompaniment
of
groans
pierre
what
can
you
put
in
your
left
hand
that
you
can
not
place
in
the
right
stop
grunting
like
a
pig
and
think
man
pierre
would
give
a
final
rumble
and
begin
to
think
deeply
i
can
not
think
i
in
my
left
hand
le
in
your
left
hand
the
little
crowd
in
the
dressing
room
would
draw
in
close
about
the
table
to
listen
i
do
not
know
monsieur
idiot
henri
would
say
your
right
elbow
man
and
the
dressing
was
done
he
had
an
inexhaustible
stock
of
such
riddles
almost
never
guessed
he
would
tell
the
answer
and
then
laugh
delightedly
and
pain
seemed
to
leave
the
little
room
when
he
entered
it
it
was
that
night
that
henri
disappeared
xvii
there
was
a
question
to
settle
and
it
was
for
henri
to
do
it
two
questions
indeed
one
was
a
matter
of
engineering
and
before
the
bottom
fell
out
of
his
world
henri
had
studied
engineering
the
second
was
more
serious
for
the
first
this
thing
had
happened
of
all
the
trenches
to
be
held
the
belgians
had
undeniably
the
worst
properly
speaking
they
were
not
trenches
at
all
but
shallow
gutters
dug
a
foot
or
two
into
the
saturated
ground
and
then
built
with
bags
of
earth
or
sand
here
and
there
they
were
not
dug
at
all
but
were
purely
shelters
against
a
railway
embankment
of
planks
or
sandbags
and
reinforced
by
rails
from
the
deserted
track
behind
which
they
were
hidden
for
this
corner
of
belgium
had
been
saved
by
turning
it
into
a
shallow
lake
by
opening
the
gates
in
the
dikes
the
allies
had
let
in
the
sea
and
placed
a
flood
in
front
of
the
advancing
enemy
the
battle
front
was
a
reeking
pond
the
opposing
armies
lived
like
duck
hunters
in
a
swamp
to
dig
a
foot
was
to
encounter
water
machine
guns
here
and
there
sat
but
six
inches
above
the
yellow
flood
men
lay
in
pools
to
fire
them
to
reach
outposts
were
narrow
paths
built
first
of
bags
of
earth
a
life
sometimes
for
every
bag
and
when
this
filling
was
sufficient
on
top
a
path
of
fascines
bound
together
in
bundles
made
a
footway
for
this
reason
the
belgians
approached
their
trenches
not
through
deep
cuts
which
gave
them
shelter
but
with
no
other
cover
than
the
darkness
of
night
during
the
day
they
lay
in
their
shallow
dugouts
cut
off
from
any
connection
with
the
world
behind
them
food
cooked
miles
away
came
up
at
night
cold
and
unappetizing
for
water
having
exhausted
their
canteens
there
was
nothing
but
the
brackish
tide
before
them
and
reeking
of
fever
water
carts
trundled
forward
at
night
but
often
they
were
far
too
few
the
belgians
having
faced
their
future
through
long
years
of
anxiety
had
been
trained
to
fight
in
a
way
they
had
been
trained
to
fight
a
losing
war
for
they
could
not
hope
to
defeat
their
greedy
neighbor
on
the
east
but
now
they
found
themselves
fighting
almost
not
at
all
condemned
to
inactivity
to
being
almost
passively
slaughtered
by
enemy
artillery
and
to
living
under
such
conditions
as
would
have
sapped
the
courage
of
a
less
desperate
people
to
add
to
the
difficulties
not
only
did
the
sea
encroach
turning
a
fertile
land
into
a
salt
marsh
but
the
winter
rains
unusually
heavy
that
tragic
first
winter
and
lacking
their
usual
egress
to
the
sea
spread
the
flood
there
were
many
places
well
back
of
the
lines
where
fields
were
flooded
and
where
roads
sadly
needed
lost
themselves
in
unfordable
wallows
of
mud
and
water
henri
then
knowing
all
this
none
better
had
his
first
question
to
settle
which
was
this
as
spring
advanced
the
flood
had
commenced
to
recede
time
came
when
in
those
trenches
now
huddled
shallow
behind
the
railway
track
one
could
live
in
a
certain
comfort
in
the
deeper
ones
the
bottom
of
the
trench
appeared
for
the
first
time
on
a
day
previous
however
the
water
had
commenced
to
come
back
there
had
been
no
rain
but
little
by
little
in
a
certain
place
yellow
little
streams
began
to
flow
sluggishly
into
the
trenches
seeped
rather
than
flowed
at
first
the
belgian
officers
laid
it
to
that
bad
luck
that
had
so
persistently
pursued
them
then
they
held
a
conference
in
the
small
brick
house
with
its
maps
and
its
pine
tables
and
its
picture
of
an
american
harvester
on
the
wall
which
was
now
headquarters
sitting
under
the
hanging
lamp
with
an
orderly
making
coffee
at
a
stove
in
the
corner
they
talked
it
over
henri
was
there
silent
before
his
elders
but
intently
listening
and
at
last
they
turned
to
him
i
can
go
and
find
out
he
said
quietly
it
is
possible
though
i
do
not
see
how
he
smiled
they
are
i
think
only
drying
themselves
at
our
expense
it
is
a
bit
of
german
humor
but
the
cry
of
calais
in
a
month
was
in
the
air
and
undoubtedly
there
had
been
renewed
activity
along
the
german
front
near
the
sea
the
second
question
to
be
answered
was
dependent
on
the
first
had
the
germans
as
henri
said
merely
shifted
the
water
by
some
clever
engineering
to
the
belgian
trenches
or
was
there
some
bigger
thing
on
hand
what
for
instance
if
they
were
about
to
attempt
to
drain
the
inundation
smash
the
belgian
line
and
march
by
the
dunkirk
road
to
calais
so
that
night
while
henri
jested
about
pierre
right
elbow
and
watched
sara
lee
for
a
smile
he
had
difficult
work
before
him
sometime
near
midnight
he
slipped
away
jean
was
waiting
in
the
street
and
wrung
the
boy
hand
i
could
go
with
you
he
said
rather
wistfully
you
do
speak
their
ugly
tongue
i
could
be
mute
shell
shock
you
could
be
helping
me
back
but
henri
only
held
his
hand
a
moment
and
shook
his
head
you
would
double
the
risk
and
what
good
would
it
do
two
pistols
are
better
than
one
i
have
two
pistols
my
friend
said
henri
and
turned
the
corner
of
the
building
past
the
boards
rené
had
built
in
toward
the
house
of
the
mill
but
once
out
of
jean
sight
he
stopped
a
moment
his
hand
resting
against
that
frail
wall
to
sara
lee
room
it
was
his
to
her
for
three
days
jean
stayed
in
the
village
he
slept
at
the
mill
but
he
came
for
his
meals
to
the
little
house
once
he
went
to
dunkirk
and
brought
out
provisions
and
the
mail
including
sara
lee
monthly
allowance
but
mostly
he
sat
in
the
mill
house
and
waited
he
could
not
read
you
do
not
eat
at
all
jean
sara
lee
said
to
him
more
than
once
and
twice
she
insisted
that
he
was
feverish
and
placed
a
hand
that
was
somewhat
marred
with
much
peeling
of
vegetables
on
his
forehead
i
am
entirely
well
mademoiselle
he
would
say
and
draw
back
he
had
anxieties
enough
just
now
without
being
reminded
by
the
touch
of
a
woman
hand
of
all
that
he
had
lost
long
before
that
sara
lee
had
learned
not
to
question
jean
about
absences
even
his
knowledge
now
that
she
knew
something
of
work
did
not
remove
the
barrier
so
sara
lee
waited
as
did
jean
but
more
helplessly
she
knew
something
was
wrong
but
she
had
not
privilege
of
going
at
night
to
the
trenches
and
there
waiting
staring
over
the
gray
water
with
its
ugly
floating
shadows
for
henri
to
emerge
from
the
flood
something
rather
forced
and
mechanical
there
was
those
days
in
her
work
her
smile
was
rather
set
she
did
not
sleep
well
and
one
night
she
violated
henri
orders
and
walked
across
the
softened
fields
to
beyond
the
poplar
trees
there
was
nothing
to
see
except
an
intermittent
flash
from
the
clouds
that
hung
low
over
the
sea
at
nieuport
where
british
gunboats
were
bombarding
the
coast
or
the
steady
streaks
from
the
ypres
salient
where
night
and
day
the
guns
never
rested
from
the
belgian
trenches
fifteen
hundred
feet
or
so
away
there
was
no
sound
a
german
electric
signal
blazed
its
message
in
code
and
went
out
quickly
now
and
then
a
rifle
shot
thin
and
sharp
rang
out
from
where
under
the
floating
starlights
keen
eyes
on
each
side
watched
for
movements
on
the
other
sara
lee
sat
down
under
a
tree
and
watched
for
a
while
then
she
found
herself
crying
softly
it
was
all
so
sad
and
useless
and
cruel
and
somewhere
there
ahead
was
henri
henri
with
his
blue
eyes
his
smile
the
ardor
of
his
young
arms
henri
who
had
been
to
her
many
friends
sara
lee
had
never
deceived
herself
about
henri
she
loved
him
but
she
was
quite
certain
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
which
is
entirely
different
she
knew
that
this
last
was
impossible
because
she
was
engaged
to
harvey
what
was
probably
the
truth
was
that
she
loved
them
both
in
entirely
different
ways
men
have
always
insisted
on
such
possibilities
and
have
even
asserted
their
right
now
and
then
to
love
two
women
at
the
same
time
but
women
are
less
frank
with
themselves
and
in
such
cases
there
is
no
grand
passion
there
are
tenderness
and
the
joy
of
companionship
and
sometimes
a
touching
dependence
but
it
is
not
a
love
that
burns
with
a
white
fire
perhaps
sara
lee
was
one
of
those
women
who
are
always
loved
more
than
they
love
there
are
such
women
not
selfish
not
seeking
love
but
softly
feminine
kind
appealing
and
genuine
men
need
after
all
but
an
altar
on
which
to
lay
tribute
and
the
high
remote
white
altar
that
was
sara
lee
had
already
received
the
love
of
two
strong
men
she
was
not
troubling
her
head
that
night
however
about
being
an
altar
of
a
sort
she
cried
a
little
at
first
because
she
was
terrified
for
henri
and
because
jean
face
was
growing
pinched
and
gray
then
she
cried
very
hard
prone
on
the
ground
and
face
down
because
henri
was
young
and
all
of
life
should
have
been
before
him
and
he
was
missing
henri
was
undeniably
missing
even
the
king
knew
it
now
and
set
down
in
his
heart
among
the
other
crosses
there
henri
full
name
which
we
may
not
know
and
took
to
pacing
his
little
study
and
looking
out
at
the
spring
sea
that
night
marie
having
ladled
to
the
bottom
of
her
kettle
found
sara
lee
missing
and
was
told
by
rené
of
the
direction
she
had
taken
marie
muttering
to
herself
set
out
to
find
her
and
almost
stumbled
over
her
in
the
wood
by
the
road
she
sat
down
on
the
ground
without
a
word
and
placed
a
clumsy
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
it
was
not
until
sara
lee
ceased
sobbing
that
she
spoke
it
is
far
from
hopeless
mademoiselle
they
had
by
now
established
a
system
of
communication
sara
lee
spoke
her
orders
in
halting
french
but
general
conversation
was
beyond
her
and
much
hearing
of
english
had
taught
the
belgian
girl
enough
to
follow
sara
lee
replied
then
in
smothered
english
he
is
gone
marie
he
will
never
come
back
who
can
tell
there
are
many
missing
who
are
not
dead
sara
lee
shuddered
for
spies
were
not
made
prisoners
they
had
no
rights
as
prisoners
of
war
their
own
governments
did
not
protect
them
to
henri
capture
was
death
but
she
could
not
say
this
to
marie
marie
sat
softly
stroking
sara
lee
hair
her
own
eyes
tragic
and
tearless
even
if
it
were
the
other
she
said
it
is
not
so
bad
to
die
for
one
country
the
thing
that
is
terrible
that
leaves
behind
it
only
bitterness
and
grief
and
no
hope
mademoiselle
even
with
many
prayers
is
that
one
has
died
a
traitor
she
coaxed
sara
lee
back
at
last
they
went
through
the
fields
for
fresh
troops
were
being
thrown
into
the
belgian
trenches
and
the
street
was
full
of
men
great
dray
horses
were
dragging
forward
batteries
the
heavy
guns
sliding
and
slipping
in
the
absence
of
such
information
as
only
henri
had
been
wont
to
bring
it
was
best
to
provide
for
the
worst
the
next
day
jean
did
not
come
over
for
breakfast
and
rené
handed
sara
lee
a
note
i
am
going
to
england
jean
had
written
that
dawn
in
the
house
of
the
mill
and
from
there
to
holland
i
can
get
past
the
barrier
and
shall
work
down
toward
the
front
i
must
learn
what
has
happened
mademoiselle
as
you
know
if
he
was
captured
there
is
no
hope
but
there
is
an
excellent
chance
that
he
is
in
hiding
unable
to
get
back
look
for
me
in
two
weeks
there
followed
what
instructions
he
had
given
as
to
her
supplies
which
would
come
as
before
beautifully
written
in
jean
small
fine
hand
it
spelled
for
sara
lee
the
last
hope
she
read
jean
desperation
through
its
forced
cheerfulness
and
she
faced
for
the
first
time
a
long
period
of
loneliness
in
the
crowded
little
house
she
tried
very
hard
to
fill
the
gap
that
henri
had
left
tried
to
joke
with
the
men
in
her
queer
bits
of
french
was
more
smiling
than
ever
for
fear
she
might
be
less
but
now
and
then
in
cautious
whispers
she
heard
henri
name
and
her
heart
contracted
with
very
terror
a
week
two
weeks
twice
the
village
was
bombarded
severely
but
the
little
house
escaped
by
a
miracle
marie
considered
it
the
same
miracle
that
left
holy
pictures
unhurt
on
the
walls
of
destroyed
houses
and
allowed
the
frailest
of
old
ebony
and
rosewood
crucifixes
to
remain
unharmed
great
generals
often
as
tall
as
they
were
great
stopped
at
the
little
house
to
implore
sara
lee
to
leave
but
she
only
shook
her
head
not
unless
you
send
me
away
she
always
said
and
that
would
break
my
heart
but
to
move
mademoiselle
only
to
the
next
village
they
would
remonstrate
and
as
a
final
argument
you
are
too
valuable
to
risk
an
injury
i
must
remain
here
she
said
and
some
of
them
thought
they
understood
when
an
unusually
obdurate
officer
came
along
sara
lee
would
insist
on
taking
him
to
the
cellar
you
see
she
would
say
holding
her
candle
high
it
is
a
nice
cellar
warm
and
dry
it
is
proudly
one
of
the
best
cellars
in
the
village
it
is
a
really
homelike
cellar
the
officer
would
go
away
then
and
send
her
cigarettes
for
her
men
or
as
in
more
than
one
case
a
squad
with
bags
of
earth
and
other
things
to
protect
the
little
house
as
much
as
possible
after
a
time
the
little
house
began
to
represent
the
ideas
in
protection
and
camouflage
then
in
its
early
stages
of
many
different
minds
rené
shot
a
man
there
one
night
a
skulking
figure
working
its
way
in
the
shadows
up
the
street
it
was
just
before
dawn
and
rené
who
was
sleepless
those
days
like
the
others
called
to
him
the
man
started
to
run
dodging
behind
walls
but
rené
ran
faster
and
killed
him
he
was
a
german
in
belgian
peasant
clothing
but
he
wore
the
great
shoes
of
the
german
soldier
and
he
had
been
making
a
rough
map
of
the
belgian
trenches
sara
lee
did
not
see
him
but
when
she
heard
the
shot
she
went
out
and
rené
told
her
breathlessly
from
that
time
on
her
terrors
took
the
definite
form
of
henri
lying
dead
in
a
ruined
street
and
being
buried
as
this
man
was
buried
without
ceremony
and
without
a
prayer
in
some
sodden
spring
field
xviii
as
the
spring
advanced
harvey
grew
increasingly
bitter
grew
morbid
and
increasingly
also
he
began
to
think
that
people
were
smiling
behind
his
back
and
when
they
asked
about
sara
lee
he
met
with
almost
insulting
brevity
what
he
felt
was
kindness
he
went
nowhere
and
worked
all
day
and
until
late
in
the
night
he
did
well
in
his
business
however
and
late
in
march
he
received
a
substantial
raise
in
salary
he
took
it
without
enthusiasm
and
told
belle
that
night
at
dinner
with
apathy
after
the
evening
meal
it
was
now
his
custom
to
go
to
his
room
and
there
shut
in
to
read
he
read
no
books
on
the
war
and
even
the
quarter
column
entitled
salient
points
of
the
day
war
news
hardly
received
a
glance
from
him
now
in
the
office
when
the
talk
turned
to
the
war
as
it
did
almost
hourly
he
would
go
out
or
scowl
over
his
letters
harvey
hit
hard
they
said
there
he
acting
like
a
rotten
cub
was
likely
to
be
the
next
sentence
but
sometimes
it
was
well
what
you
expect
everything
ready
to
get
married
and
the
girl
beating
it
for
france
without
notice
i
be
sore
myself
on
the
day
of
the
raise
in
salary
his
sister
got
the
children
to
bed
and
straightened
up
the
litter
of
small
garments
that
seemed
always
to
bestrew
the
house
even
to
the
lower
floor
then
she
went
into
room
coat
and
collar
off
he
was
lying
on
the
bed
but
not
reading
his
book
lay
beside
him
and
with
his
arms
under
his
head
he
was
staring
at
the
ceiling
she
did
not
sit
down
beside
him
on
the
bed
they
were
an
undemonstrative
family
and
such
endearments
as
belle
used
were
lavished
on
her
children
but
her
eyes
were
kind
and
a
little
nervous
do
you
mind
talking
a
little
harvey
i
do
feel
like
talking
much
i
tired
i
guess
but
go
on
what
is
it
bills
she
came
to
him
in
her
constant
financial
anxieties
and
always
he
was
ready
to
help
her
out
but
his
tone
now
was
gruff
a
slight
flush
of
resentment
colored
her
cheeks
not
this
time
harve
i
was
just
thinking
about
things
sit
down
she
sat
on
the
straight
chair
beside
the
bed
the
chair
on
which
in
neat
order
harvey
placed
his
clothing
at
night
his
shoes
beneath
his
coat
over
the
back
i
wish
you
go
out
more
harvey
why
go
out
and
talk
to
a
lot
of
driveling
fools
who
do
care
for
me
any
more
than
i
do
for
them
that
not
like
you
harve
sorry
his
tone
softened
i
do
care
much
about
going
round
belle
that
all
i
guess
you
know
why
illustration
that
henri
might
be
living
somewhere
that
some
day
the
belgians
might
go
home
again
so
does
everybody
else
he
sat
up
and
looked
at
her
well
suppose
they
do
i
ca
help
that
can
i
when
a
fellow
has
been
jilted
you
have
been
jilted
he
lay
down
again
his
arms
under
his
head
and
belle
knew
that
his
eyes
were
on
sara
lee
picture
on
his
dresser
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
harvey
belle
said
hesitatingly
i
brought
sara
lee
report
from
the
ladies
aid
may
i
read
it
to
you
i
do
want
to
hear
it
then
give
it
here
i
look
at
it
he
read
it
carefully
his
hands
rather
unsteady
so
many
men
given
soup
so
many
given
chocolate
so
many
dressings
done
and
at
the
bottom
sara
lee
request
for
more
money
an
apologetic
rather
breathless
request
and
closing
rather
primly
with
this
i
am
sure
that
the
society
will
feel
from
the
above
report
that
the
work
is
worth
while
and
worth
continuing
i
am
only
sorry
that
i
can
not
send
photographs
of
the
men
who
come
for
aid
but
as
they
come
at
night
it
is
impossible
i
enclose
however
a
small
picture
of
the
house
which
is
now
known
as
the
little
house
of
mercy
at
night
said
harvey
so
she
there
alone
with
a
lot
of
ignorant
foreigners
at
night
why
the
devil
do
they
come
in
the
daytime
here
the
picture
harvey
he
got
up
then
and
carried
the
tiny
photograph
over
close
to
the
gas
jet
there
he
stood
for
a
long
time
gazing
at
it
there
was
rené
with
his
rifle
and
his
smile
there
was
marie
in
her
white
apron
and
in
the
center
the
wind
blowing
her
soft
hair
was
sara
lee
harvey
groaned
and
belle
came
over
and
putting
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
looked
at
the
photograph
with
him
do
you
know
what
i
think
harvey
she
said
i
think
sara
lee
is
right
and
you
are
wrong
he
turned
on
her
almost
savagely
that
not
the
point
he
snapped
out
i
do
begrudge
the
poor
devils
their
soup
what
i
feel
is
this
if
she
cared
a
tinker
damn
for
me
she
never
have
gone
that
all
he
returned
to
a
moody
survey
of
the
picture
look
at
it
he
said
she
insists
that
she
safe
but
that
got
a
gun
what
for
if
she
so
safe
and
look
at
that
house
a
corner
shot
away
and
it
got
no
upper
floor
safe
belle
held
out
her
hand
i
must
return
the
picture
to
the
society
harve
not
just
yet
he
said
ominously
i
want
to
look
at
it
i
got
it
all
yet
and
i
return
it
myself
with
a
short
speech
harvey
well
he
retorted
why
should
i
tell
that
lot
of
old
scandalmongers
what
i
think
of
them
they
sit
here
safe
at
home
and
beg
money
god
one
of
them
was
in
the
office
and
send
a
young
girl
over
to
you
better
get
out
belle
i
not
company
for
any
one
she
turned
away
but
he
came
after
her
and
suddenly
putting
his
arms
round
her
he
kissed
her
do
worry
about
me
he
said
i
done
with
wearing
my
heart
on
my
sleeve
she
looks
happy
so
i
guess
i
can
be
he
released
her
good
night
i
return
the
picture
he
sat
up
very
late
alternately
reading
the
report
and
looking
at
the
picture
it
was
unfortunate
that
sara
lee
had
smiled
into
the
camera
coupled
with
her
blowing
hair
it
had
given
her
a
a
sort
of
joyousness
that
hurt
him
to
the
soul
he
made
some
mad
plans
after
he
had
turned
out
the
lights
to
flirt
wildly
with
the
unattached
girls
he
knew
to
go
to
france
and
confront
sara
lee
and
then
bring
her
home
or
he
had
found
a
way
he
lay
there
and
thought
it
over
and
it
bore
the
test
of
the
broken
sleep
that
followed
in
the
morning
dressing
he
wondered
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
he
was
more
cheerful
at
breakfast
than
he
had
been
for
weeks
xix
in
the
little
house
of
mercy
two
weeks
went
by
and
then
a
third
soldiers
marching
out
to
the
trenches
sometimes
wore
flowers
tucked
gayly
in
their
caps
more
and
more
allied
aëroplanes
were
in
the
air
sometimes
standing
in
the
streets
sara
lee
saw
one
far
overhead
while
clouds
of
bursting
shells
hung
far
below
it
once
or
twice
in
the
early
morning
a
german
plane
flying
so
low
that
one
could
easily
see
the
black
cross
on
each
wing
reconnoitered
the
village
for
wagon
trains
or
troops
always
they
found
it
empty
hope
had
almost
fled
now
in
the
afternoons
marie
went
to
the
ruined
church
and
there
knelt
before
the
heap
of
marble
and
masonry
that
had
once
been
the
altar
and
prayed
and
sara
lee
who
had
been
brought
up
a
protestant
and
had
never
before
entered
a
catholic
church
took
to
going
there
too
in
some
strange
fashion
the
peace
of
former
days
seemed
to
cling
to
the
little
structure
roofless
as
it
was
on
quiet
days
its
silence
was
deeper
than
elsewhere
on
days
of
much
firing
the
sound
from
within
its
broken
walls
seemed
deadened
far
away
marie
burned
a
candle
as
she
prayed
for
that
soul
in
purgatory
which
she
had
once
loved
and
now
pitied
sara
lee
burned
no
candle
but
she
knelt
sometimes
beside
marie
sometimes
alone
and
prayed
for
many
things
that
henri
should
be
living
somewhere
that
the
war
might
end
that
that
day
there
would
be
little
wounding
that
some
day
the
belgians
might
go
home
again
and
that
back
in
america
harvey
might
grow
to
understand
and
forgive
her
and
now
and
then
she
looked
into
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
and
on
those
days
she
prayed
that
her
homeland
might
before
it
was
too
late
see
this
thing
as
she
was
seeing
it
the
wanton
waste
of
it
all
the
ghastly
cruelty
the
germans
had
brought
into
this
war
sara
lee
vague
thinking
began
to
crystallize
this
war
was
not
a
judgment
sent
from
on
high
to
a
sinful
world
it
was
the
wicked
imposition
of
one
nation
on
other
nations
it
was
national
it
was
almost
racial
but
most
of
all
it
was
a
war
of
hate
on
the
german
side
she
had
never
believed
in
hate
there
were
ugly
passions
in
the
world
jealousy
envy
suspicion
but
not
hate
the
word
was
not
in
her
rather
limited
vocabulary
there
was
no
hate
on
the
part
of
the
men
she
knew
the
officers
who
stopped
in
on
their
way
to
and
from
the
trenches
were
gentlemen
and
soldiers
they
were
determined
and
grave
they
resented
they
even
loathed
but
they
did
not
hate
the
little
belgian
soldiers
were
bewildered
puzzled
desperately
resentful
but
of
hate
as
translated
into
terms
of
frightfulness
they
had
no
understanding
yet
from
the
other
side
were
coming
methods
of
war
so
wantonly
cruel
so
useless
save
as
inflicting
needless
agony
as
only
hate
could
devise
no
strategic
value
justified
them
they
were
spontaneous
outgrowths
of
venom
nursed
during
the
winter
deadlock
and
now
grown
to
full
size
and
destructive
power
the
rumor
of
a
gas
that
seared
and
killed
came
to
the
little
house
as
early
as
february
in
march
there
came
the
first
victims
poor
writhing
creatures
deprived
of
the
boon
of
air
their
seared
lungs
collapsed
and
agonized
their
faces
drawn
into
masks
of
suffering
some
of
them
died
in
the
little
house
and
even
after
death
their
faces
held
the
imprint
of
horror
to
sara
lee
burying
her
own
anxiety
under
the
cloak
of
service
there
came
new
and
terrible
thoughts
this
was
not
war
the
germans
had
sent
their
clouds
of
poisoned
gas
across
the
inundation
but
had
made
no
attempt
to
follow
this
was
killing
for
the
lust
of
killing
suffering
for
the
joy
of
inflicting
pain
and
a
day
or
so
later
she
heard
of
the
hague
convention
she
had
not
known
of
it
before
now
she
learned
of
that
gentlemen
agreement
among
nations
and
that
it
said
the
use
of
poison
or
of
poisoned
weapons
is
forbidden
she
pondered
that
carefully
trying
to
think
dispassionately
now
and
then
she
received
a
copy
of
a
home
newspaper
and
she
saw
that
the
use
of
poison
gases
was
being
denied
by
germans
in
america
and
set
down
to
rumor
and
hysteria
so
on
a
cold
spring
day
she
sat
down
at
the
table
in
the
à
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
president
beginning
and
telling
what
she
knew
of
poison
gas
she
also
on
second
thought
wrote
one
to
andrew
carnegie
who
had
built
a
library
in
her
city
she
felt
that
the
expense
to
him
of
sending
some
one
over
to
investigate
would
not
be
prohibitive
and
something
must
be
done
she
never
heard
from
either
of
her
letters
but
she
felt
better
for
having
written
them
and
a
day
or
two
later
she
received
from
travers
in
england
a
small
supply
of
the
first
gas
masks
of
the
war
simple
and
primitive
they
were
those
first
masks
useless
too
as
it
turned
out
a
square
of
folded
gauze
soaked
in
some
solution
and
then
dried
with
tapes
to
tie
it
over
the
mouth
and
nose
to
adjust
them
the
soldiers
had
but
to
stoop
and
wet
them
in
the
water
in
the
trench
and
then
to
tie
them
on
sara
lee
gave
them
out
that
night
and
there
was
much
mirth
in
the
little
house
such
mirth
as
there
had
not
been
since
henri
went
away
the
belgians
called
it
a
and
putting
them
on
bowed
before
one
another
and
requested
dances
and
even
flirted
coyly
with
each
other
over
their
bits
of
white
gauze
and
in
the
very
middle
of
the
gayety
some
one
propounded
one
of
henri
idiotic
riddles
and
sara
lee
went
across
to
her
little
room
and
closed
the
door
and
stood
there
with
her
eyes
shut
for
fear
she
would
scream
then
one
day
coming
out
of
the
little
church
she
saw
the
low
broken
gray
car
turn
in
at
the
top
of
the
street
and
come
slowly
so
very
slowly
toward
her
there
were
two
men
in
it
one
was
henri
she
ran
stumbling
because
of
tears
up
the
street
it
was
henri
there
was
no
mistake
there
he
sat
beside
jean
brushed
and
very
neat
and
very
very
white
mademoiselle
he
said
and
came
very
close
to
crying
himself
when
he
saw
her
face
he
was
greatly
excited
his
sunken
eyes
devoured
her
as
she
ran
toward
him
almost
he
held
out
his
arms
but
he
could
not
do
that
even
if
he
would
for
one
was
bandaged
to
his
side
it
is
rather
sad
to
record
how
many
times
sara
lee
wept
during
her
amazing
interlude
for
here
is
another
time
she
wept
for
joy
and
wretchedness
she
stood
on
the
running
board
and
cried
and
smiled
and
jean
winked
his
one
eye
rapidly
this
idiot
mademoiselle
he
said
gruffly
this
maniac
he
would
not
remain
in
calais
with
proper
care
he
must
come
on
here
and
rapidly
could
he
have
taken
the
wheel
from
me
we
should
have
been
here
an
hour
ago
but
for
once
i
have
an
advantage
the
car
jolted
to
the
little
house
and
jean
helped
henri
out
such
a
strange
henri
smiling
and
joyous
and
walking
at
a
crawl
even
with
jean
support
he
protested
violently
against
being
put
to
bed
and
when
he
found
himself
led
into
sara
lee
small
room
he
openly
rebelled
never
he
said
stubbornly
halting
in
the
doorway
this
is
mademoiselle
boudoir
her
as
well
i
am
going
to
the
mill
house
and
he
staggered
so
sara
lee
room
had
a
different
occupant
for
a
time
a
thin
and
young
belgian
who
yielded
to
sara
lee
when
jean
gave
up
in
despair
and
who
proceeded
most
unmanfully
to
faint
as
soon
as
he
was
between
the
blankets
if
sara
lee
hoped
to
nurse
henri
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
jean
it
was
who
took
over
the
care
of
the
boy
a
jean
who
now
ate
prodigiously
and
whistled
occasionally
and
slept
at
night
robed
in
his
blanket
on
the
floor
beside
henri
bed
lest
that
rebellious
invalid
get
up
and
try
to
move
about
on
the
first
night
with
the
door
closed
against
henri
entreaties
while
the
little
house
received
its
evening
complement
of
men
and
with
henri
lying
back
on
his
pillows
fresh
dressed
as
to
the
wounds
in
his
arm
and
chest
fed
with
sara
lee
daintiest
and
resting
jean
found
the
boy
eyes
resting
on
the
mantel
dear
and
obstinate
friend
said
henri
do
you
wish
me
to
be
happy
you
shall
not
leave
the
room
or
your
bed
that
is
arranged
for
how
demanded
henri
with
interest
because
i
have
hidden
away
your
trousers
henri
laughed
but
he
sobered
quickly
if
you
wish
me
to
be
happy
he
said
take
away
that
american
photograph
but
first
please
to
bring
it
here
jean
brought
it
holding
it
gingerly
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
and
henri
lay
back
and
studied
it
it
is
mademoiselle
fiancé
he
said
jean
grunted
look
at
it
jean
henri
said
in
his
tone
with
despair
beneath
it
and
then
look
at
me
or
no
remembering
me
as
i
was
when
i
was
a
man
he
is
better
eh
it
is
a
good
face
but
there
is
a
jaw
a
do
you
think
he
will
be
kind
to
her
as
she
requires
she
requires
much
kindness
some
women
he
broke
off
and
watched
jean
anxiously
a
half
face
jean
said
scornfully
the
pretty
view
as
for
kindness
he
put
the
photograph
face
down
on
the
table
i
knew
once
a
man
in
belgium
who
married
an
american
at
antwerp
they
were
most
unhappy
henri
smiled
you
are
lying
he
said
with
boyish
pleasure
in
his
own
astuteness
you
knew
no
such
couple
you
are
trying
to
make
me
resigned
but
quite
a
little
later
when
jean
thought
he
was
asleep
he
said
i
shall
never
be
resigned
so
at
last
spring
had
come
and
henri
and
the
great
spring
drive
the
germans
had
not
drained
the
inundation
nor
had
they
broken
through
to
calais
and
it
is
not
to
be
known
here
how
much
this
utter
failure
had
been
due
to
the
information
henri
had
secured
before
he
was
wounded
one
day
in
his
bed
henri
received
a
visit
from
the
king
and
was
left
lying
with
a
decoration
on
his
breast
and
a
beatific
if
somewhat
sheepish
expression
on
his
face
and
one
night
the
village
was
bombarded
and
on
henri
refusing
to
be
moved
to
the
cellar
sara
lee
took
up
a
determined
stand
in
his
doorway
until
at
last
he
made
a
most
humiliating
move
for
safety
bit
by
bit
sara
lee
got
the
story
its
bare
detail
from
henri
its
courage
and
sheer
recklessness
from
jean
it
would
for
instance
run
like
this
with
henri
in
a
chair
perhaps
and
cutting
dressings
since
that
might
be
done
with
one
hand
and
sara
lee
sleeves
rolled
up
and
a
great
bowl
of
vegetables
before
her
and
when
you
got
through
the
water
henri
she
would
ask
what
then
it
was
quite
simple
they
had
put
up
some
additional
wire
however
where
there
was
a
break
he
would
explain
i
have
told
you
between
their
trenches
i
had
used
it
before
to
get
through
but
how
could
you
go
through
like
a
snake
he
would
say
smiling
very
flat
and
wriggling
i
have
eaten
of
the
dirt
mademoiselle
then
he
would
stop
and
cut
very
awkwardly
with
his
left
hand
go
on
she
would
prompt
him
but
they
had
put
barbed
wire
there
is
that
it
so
you
could
not
get
through
with
tin
cans
on
it
and
stones
in
the
cans
i
thought
i
had
removed
them
all
but
there
was
one
left
so
they
heard
me
more
cutting
and
a
muttered
french
expletive
henri
was
not
a
particularly
patient
cripple
and
apparently
there
was
an
end
to
the
story
for
goodness
sake
sara
lee
would
exclaim
despairingly
so
they
heard
you
that
is
all
is
it
it
was
almost
all
he
would
say
with
his
boyish
smile
and
they
shot
at
you
even
better
they
shot
me
that
was
this
one
and
he
would
point
to
his
arm
more
silence
more
cutting
a
gathering
exasperation
on
sara
lee
part
are
you
going
on
or
not
then
i
pretended
to
be
one
of
them
mademoiselle
i
speak
german
as
french
i
pretended
not
to
be
hurt
but
to
be
on
a
reconnoissance
and
i
got
into
the
trench
and
we
had
a
talk
in
the
darkness
it
was
most
interesting
only
if
they
had
shown
a
light
they
would
have
seen
that
i
was
wounded
by
bits
not
that
day
but
after
many
days
she
got
the
story
in
the
next
trench
he
slipped
a
sling
over
the
wounded
arm
and
as
a
bavarian
on
his
way
to
the
dressing
station
got
back
i
had
some
trouble
he
confessed
one
day
now
and
then
one
would
offer
to
go
back
with
me
and
i
did
not
care
for
assistance
but
sometime
later
there
was
trouble
she
was
four
days
getting
to
that
part
of
it
he
had
got
behind
the
lines
by
that
time
and
he
knew
that
in
some
way
suspicion
had
been
roused
he
was
weak
by
that
time
and
could
not
go
far
he
had
lain
hidden
for
a
day
and
part
of
a
night
without
water
in
a
destroyed
barn
and
then
had
escaped
he
got
into
the
belgian
costume
as
before
but
he
could
not
wear
a
sling
for
his
wounded
arm
he
got
the
peasant
to
thrust
his
helpless
right
hand
into
his
pocket
and
for
two
days
he
made
a
close
inspection
of
what
was
going
on
but
fever
had
developed
and
on
the
third
night
half
delirious
when
he
was
spoken
to
by
an
officer
he
had
replied
of
all
tongues
in
english
the
officer
shot
him
instantly
in
the
chest
he
fell
and
lay
still
and
the
officer
bent
over
him
in
that
moment
henri
stabbed
him
with
a
knife
in
his
left
hand
men
were
coming
from
every
direction
but
he
got
away
he
did
not
clearly
remember
how
and
at
dawn
he
fell
into
the
belgian
farmhouse
apparently
dying
jean
story
on
the
other
hand
was
given
early
and
with
no
hesitation
he
had
crossed
the
border
at
holland
in
civilian
clothes
by
the
simple
expedient
of
bribing
a
sentry
he
had
got
with
little
difficulty
to
the
farmhouse
and
found
henri
now
recovering
but
very
weak
he
was
lying
hidden
in
a
garret
and
he
was
suffering
from
hunger
and
lack
of
medical
attention
in
a
wagon
full
of
market
stuff
henri
hidden
in
the
bed
of
it
they
had
got
to
the
border
again
and
there
jean
had
it
seemed
stabbed
the
sentry
he
had
bribed
before
and
driven
on
to
neutral
soil
not
an
unusual
story
that
of
henri
and
jean
the
journey
across
belgium
in
the
springless
farm
wagon
was
the
worst
they
had
had
to
take
roundabout
lanes
avoiding
the
main
highways
fortunately
always
at
night
there
were
friendly
houses
kind
hands
to
lift
henri
into
warm
interiors
many
messages
they
had
brought
back
some
of
cheer
but
too
often
of
tragedy
from
the
small
farmsteads
of
belgium
then
finally
had
been
holland
and
the
chartering
of
a
boat
and
at
last
here
we
are
and
here
we
are
and
here
we
are
again
sang
henri
chopping
at
his
cotton
and
making
a
great
show
of
cheerfulness
before
sara
lee
but
with
jean
sometimes
he
showed
the
black
depression
beneath
he
would
never
be
a
man
again
he
was
done
for
he
gained
strength
so
slowly
that
he
believed
he
was
not
gaining
at
all
he
was
not
happy
and
the
unhappy
mend
slowly
after
the
time
he
had
asked
jean
to
take
away
harvey
photograph
he
did
not
recur
to
the
subject
but
he
did
not
need
to
jean
knew
perhaps
even
better
than
henri
himself
that
the
boy
was
recklessly
hopelessly
not
quite
rationally
in
love
with
the
american
girl
also
henri
was
fretting
about
his
work
sometimes
at
night
following
henri
instructions
jean
wandered
quietly
along
roads
and
paths
that
paralleled
the
front
at
such
times
his
eyes
were
turned
not
toward
the
trenches
but
toward
that
flat
country
which
lay
behind
still
dotted
at
that
time
with
groves
of
trees
with
canals
overhung
with
pollard
willows
and
with
here
and
there
a
farmhouse
that
at
night
took
on
in
the
starlight
the
appearance
of
being
whole
again
singularly
white
and
peaceful
were
those
small
steadings
of
belgium
in
the
night
hours
until
cruel
dawn
showed
them
for
what
they
were
skeletons
of
dead
homes
clothed
only
at
night
with
wraithlike
roofs
and
chimneys
ghosts
of
houses
appearing
between
midnight
and
cock
crow
jean
had
not
henri
eyes
nor
his
recklessness
nor
his
speed
for
that
matter
now
and
then
he
saw
the
small
appearing
and
disappearing
lights
on
some
small
rise
he
would
reach
the
spot
with
such
shelter
as
possible
to
find
only
a
field
neglected
and
unplowed
then
one
night
tragedy
came
to
the
little
house
of
mercy
xx
harvey
proceeded
to
put
his
plan
into
effect
at
once
with
the
simple
method
of
an
essentially
simple
nature
the
thing
had
become
intolerable
therefore
it
must
end
on
the
afternoon
following
his
talk
with
belle
he
came
home
at
three
belle
heard
him
moving
about
in
his
room
and
when
she
entered
it
after
he
had
gone
she
found
that
he
had
shaved
and
put
on
his
best
suit
she
smiled
a
little
it
was
like
harvey
to
be
literal
he
had
said
he
was
going
to
go
round
and
have
a
good
time
and
he
was
losing
no
time
but
in
their
restricted
social
life
where
most
of
the
men
worked
until
five
or
even
later
there
were
fewer
afternoon
calls
paid
belle
wondered
with
mild
sisterly
curiosity
into
what
arena
harvey
was
about
to
fling
his
best
hat
but
though
harvey
paid
a
call
that
afternoon
it
was
not
on
any
of
the
young
women
he
knew
he
went
to
see
gregory
she
was
at
home
he
had
arranged
for
that
by
telephone
and
the
one
butler
of
the
neighborhood
admitted
him
it
was
a
truculent
young
man
for
all
his
politeness
who
confronted
gregory
in
her
a
quietly
truculent
young
man
who
came
to
the
point
while
he
was
still
shaking
hands
you
not
going
to
be
glad
to
see
me
in
a
minute
he
said
in
reply
to
her
greeting
how
can
you
know
that
because
i
come
to
get
you
to
do
something
you
wo
want
to
do
we
wo
quarrel
before
we
begin
then
she
said
pleasantly
because
i
really
never
do
anything
i
do
wish
to
do
but
she
gave
him
a
second
glance
and
her
smile
became
a
trifle
forced
she
knew
all
about
harvey
and
sara
lee
she
had
heard
rumors
of
his
disapproval
also
though
she
was
not
a
clever
nor
a
very
keen
woman
she
saw
what
was
coming
and
braced
herself
for
it
harvey
had
prepared
in
his
mind
a
summary
of
his
position
and
he
delivered
it
with
the
rapidity
and
strength
of
a
blow
i
know
all
about
the
belgians
gregory
he
said
i
sorry
for
them
so
is
every
one
i
suppose
but
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
a
girl
of
twenty
ought
to
be
over
there
practically
at
the
front
and
alone
he
gave
her
time
to
reply
would
you
like
to
have
your
daughter
there
if
you
had
one
perhaps
not
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
this
is
war
it
is
not
our
war
humanity
said
gregory
remembering
the
phrase
she
had
written
for
a
speech
humanity
has
no
nationality
it
is
of
all
men
for
all
men
that
men
not
women
he
got
up
and
stood
on
the
hearthrug
he
was
singularly
reminiscent
of
the
time
he
had
stood
on
aunt
harriet
white
fur
rug
and
had
told
sara
lee
she
could
not
go
now
see
here
gregory
he
said
we
stop
beating
about
the
bush
if
you
do
mind
she
got
to
come
home
she
coming
if
i
have
to
go
and
get
her
you
need
look
at
me
so
fiercely
i
did
send
her
it
was
her
own
idea
harvey
sneered
no
he
said
slowly
but
i
notice
your
society
publishes
her
reports
in
the
papers
and
that
the
names
of
the
officers
are
rarely
missing
gregory
colored
we
must
have
publicity
to
get
money
she
said
it
is
hard
to
get
sometimes
i
have
had
to
make
up
the
deficit
out
of
my
own
pocket
then
for
god
sake
bring
her
home
if
the
thing
has
to
go
on
send
over
there
some
of
the
women
who
have
no
ties
let
get
shot
if
they
want
to
they
can
write
as
good
reports
as
she
can
if
that
all
you
want
and
make
as
good
soup
he
added
bitterly
it
could
be
done
of
course
she
said
thoughtfully
but
i
must
tell
you
this
i
doubt
if
an
older
woman
could
have
got
where
she
has
there
is
no
doubt
that
her
charm
her
youth
and
beauty
have
helped
her
greatly
we
can
not
the
very
whites
of
his
eyes
turned
red
then
he
shouted
furiously
that
for
their
silly
work
and
their
love
of
publicity
they
were
trading
on
a
girl
youth
and
beauty
that
if
anything
happened
to
her
he
would
publish
the
truth
in
every
newspaper
in
the
country
that
they
would
at
once
recall
sara
lee
or
he
would
placard
the
city
with
what
they
were
doing
these
were
only
a
few
of
the
things
he
threw
at
her
when
he
was
out
of
breath
he
jerked
the
picture
of
the
little
house
of
mercy
out
of
his
pocket
and
flung
it
into
her
lap
there
he
said
do
you
know
where
that
house
is
it
in
a
ruined
village
she
has
said
that
has
she
well
look
at
the
masonry
there
that
a
shell
hole
in
the
street
that
soldier
got
a
gun
why
because
the
germans
may
march
up
that
street
any
day
on
their
way
to
calais
gregory
looked
at
the
picture
sara
lee
smiled
into
the
sun
and
rené
ignorant
that
his
single
rifle
was
to
oppose
the
march
of
the
german
army
to
calais
rené
smiled
also
gregory
rose
i
shall
report
your
view
to
the
society
she
said
coldly
i
understand
how
you
feel
but
i
fail
to
see
the
reason
for
this
attack
on
me
i
guess
you
see
all
right
he
flung
at
her
she
my
future
wife
if
you
had
put
this
nonsense
into
her
head
we
be
married
now
and
she
be
here
in
god
country
and
not
living
with
a
lot
of
foreigners
who
do
know
a
good
woman
when
they
see
one
i
want
her
back
all
but
i
want
her
back
safe
and
if
anything
happens
to
her
make
you
pay
you
and
all
your
notoriety
hunters
he
went
out
then
and
was
for
leaving
without
his
hat
or
coat
but
the
butler
caught
him
at
the
door
out
in
the
spring
sunlight
he
walked
rapidly
still
seething
remembering
other
bitter
things
he
had
meant
to
say
and
repeating
them
to
himself
but
he
had
said
enough
gregory
account
of
his
visit
she
reported
at
a
meeting
specially
called
the
narrative
lost
nothing
in
the
repetition
but
the
kindly
women
who
sat
in
the
church
house
sewing
or
knitting
listened
to
what
harvey
had
said
and
looked
troubled
they
liked
sara
lee
and
many
of
them
had
daughters
of
their
own
the
photograph
was
passed
around
undoubtedly
sara
lee
was
living
in
a
ruined
village
certainly
ruined
villages
were
only
found
very
near
the
front
and
rené
unquestionably
held
a
gun
tales
of
german
brutalities
to
women
had
come
and
were
coming
constantly
to
their
ears
mabel
andrews
had
written
to
them
for
supplies
and
she
had
added
to
the
chapter
of
horrors
briefly
the
sense
of
the
meeting
was
that
harvey
had
been
brutal
but
that
he
was
right
an
older
woman
in
a
safe
place
they
might
continue
to
support
but
none
of
them
would
assume
the
responsibility
of
the
crushing
out
of
a
young
girl
life
to
be
quite
frank
possibly
harvey
appeal
would
have
carried
less
weight
had
it
not
coincided
with
sara
lee
request
for
more
money
neither
one
alone
would
have
brought
about
the
catastrophe
but
altogether
they
made
question
and
answer
problem
and
solution
money
was
scarce
demands
were
heavy
none
of
them
except
gregory
had
more
than
just
enough
and
there
was
this
additional
situation
to
face
there
was
no
end
of
the
war
in
sight
it
gave
promise
now
of
going
on
indefinitely
joifre
had
said
i
nibble
them
but
to
nibble
a
hole
in
the
germany
army
might
take
years
they
had
sent
sara
lee
for
a
few
months
how
about
keeping
her
there
indefinitely
oddly
enough
it
was
harvey
sister
belle
who
made
the
only
protest
against
the
recall
of
course
i
want
her
back
she
said
slowly
you
understand
better
if
you
had
to
live
with
harvey
i
sorry
gregory
that
he
spoke
to
you
as
he
did
but
he
nearly
crazy
she
eyed
the
assembly
with
her
tired
shrewd
eyes
i
no
talker
she
went
on
but
sara
lee
has
done
a
big
thing
we
do
realize
i
guess
how
big
it
is
and
i
think
we
just
about
kill
her
if
we
bring
her
home
better
to
do
that
than
to
have
her
killed
over
there
some
one
said
and
in
spite
of
belle
protest
that
remained
the
sense
of
the
meeting
it
was
put
to
the
vote
and
decided
to
recall
sara
lee
she
could
bring
a
report
of
conditions
and
if
she
thought
it
wise
an
older
woman
could
go
later
to
a
safer
place
belle
was
very
quiet
that
evening
after
dinner
she
went
to
room
and
found
him
dressing
to
go
out
i
going
with
a
crowd
to
the
theater
he
said
first
week
of
the
summer
stock
company
you
know
he
tied
his
tie
defiantly
avoiding
belle
eyes
in
the
mirror
harvey
she
said
they
going
to
bring
sara
lee
home
he
said
nothing
but
his
hands
shook
somewhat
and
i
think
belle
said
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
what
you
have
done
all
the
rest
of
your
life
xxi
by
the
time
henri
was
well
enough
to
resume
his
former
activities
it
was
almost
the
first
of
may
the
winter
quiet
was
over
with
a
vengeance
and
the
allies
were
hammering
hard
with
their
first
tolerably
full
supply
of
shells
cheering
reports
came
daily
to
the
little
house
of
rapidly
augmenting
armies
of
big
guns
on
caterpillar
trucks
that
were
moving
slowly
up
to
the
allied
front
great
britain
had
at
last
learned
her
lesson
that
only
shells
of
immense
destructiveness
were
of
any
avail
against
the
german
batteries
she
was
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
get
them
but
the
supply
was
still
inadequate
with
the
new
shells
experiments
were
being
made
in
barrage
fire
costly
experiments
now
and
then
but
the
allies
were
apt
in
learning
the
ugly
game
of
modern
war
only
on
the
belgian
front
was
there
small
change
the
shattered
army
was
being
freshly
outfitted
england
was
sending
money
and
ammunition
and
on
the
sand
dunes
small
bodies
of
fresh
troops
drilled
and
smiled
grimly
and
drilled
again
but
there
were
not
as
in
england
and
in
france
great
bodies
of
young
men
to
draw
from
too
many
had
been
caught
beyond
the
german
wall
of
steel
yet
a
wave
of
renewed
courage
had
come
with
the
sun
and
the
green
fields
and
conditions
had
improved
for
the
belgians
in
other
ways
they
were
being
paid
for
one
thing
with
something
like
regularity
food
was
better
and
more
plentiful
one
day
henri
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
street
and
drove
down
triumphantly
a
small
unclipped
horse
which
trundled
behind
it
a
vertical
boiler
on
wheels
with
fire
box
and
stovepipe
a
portable
kitchen
he
explained
see
here
for
soup
and
here
for
coffee
and
more
are
coming
very
soon
henri
they
will
not
need
me
sara
lee
said
wistfully
but
he
protested
almost
violently
he
even
put
the
question
to
the
horse
and
blowing
in
his
ear
made
him
shake
his
head
in
the
negative
she
was
needed
indeed
to
the
great
base
hospital
at
la
panne
went
more
and
more
wounded
men
but
to
the
little
house
of
mercy
came
the
small
odds
and
ends
in
increasing
numbers
medical
men
were
scarce
and
badly
overworked
there
was
talk
for
a
time
of
sending
a
surgeon
to
the
little
house
but
it
came
to
nothing
la
panne
was
not
far
away
and
all
the
surgeons
they
could
get
there
were
not
too
many
so
the
little
house
went
on
much
as
before
henri
had
moved
to
the
mill
he
was
at
work
again
and
one
day
in
the
king
villa
and
quietly
because
of
many
reasons
henri
a
very
white
and
erect
henri
received
a
second
medal
the
highest
for
courage
that
could
be
given
he
did
not
tell
sara
lee
but
though
he
and
the
men
who
served
under
him
worked
hard
they
could
not
always
perform
miracles
the
german
planes
still
outnumbered
the
allied
ones
they
had
grown
more
daring
with
the
spring
too
and
whatever
henri
might
learn
of
ground
operations
he
could
not
foretell
those
of
the
air
on
a
moonlight
night
in
early
may
sara
lee
setting
out
her
dressings
heard
a
man
running
up
the
street
rené
challenged
him
sharply
only
to
step
aside
it
was
henri
he
burst
in
on
sara
lee
to
the
cellar
mademoiselle
he
said
a
bombardment
asked
sara
lee
from
the
air
they
may
pass
over
but
there
are
twelve
and
they
are
circling
overhead
the
first
bomb
dropped
then
in
the
street
it
was
white
moonlight
and
the
germans
must
have
seen
that
there
were
no
troops
probably
it
was
as
henri
said
later
that
they
had
learned
of
the
little
house
and
since
it
brought
such
aid
and
comfort
as
might
be
it
was
to
be
destroyed
the
house
of
the
mill
went
with
the
second
bomb
then
followed
a
deafening
uproar
as
plane
after
plane
dropped
its
shells
on
the
dead
town
marie
and
sara
lee
were
in
the
cellar
by
that
time
but
the
cellar
was
scarcely
safer
than
the
floor
above
from
a
bombardment
by
shells
from
guns
miles
away
there
was
protection
from
a
bomb
dropped
from
the
sky
the
floors
above
were
practically
useless
only
henri
and
rené
remained
on
the
street
floor
henri
was
extinguishing
lights
in
the
passage
rené
stood
not
willing
to
take
refuge
until
henri
whom
he
adored
had
done
so
for
a
moment
the
uproar
ceased
and
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
rené
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
and
made
a
gesture
of
derision
into
the
air
he
fell
there
struck
by
a
piece
of
splintered
shell
come
rené
henri
called
the
brave
are
those
who
live
to
fight
again
not
but
rené
figure
against
the
moonlight
was
gone
henri
ran
to
the
doorway
then
and
found
him
lying
his
head
on
the
little
step
where
he
had
been
wont
to
sit
and
whittle
and
sing
his
tipperaree
he
was
dead
henri
carried
him
in
and
laid
him
in
the
little
passage
very
reverently
then
he
went
below
where
is
rené
sara
lee
asked
from
the
darkness
a
foolish
boy
said
henri
a
catch
in
his
throat
he
is
i
think
watching
these
fiends
of
the
air
from
some
shelter
there
is
no
shelter
shivered
the
girl
he
groped
for
her
hand
in
the
darkness
and
so
they
stood
hand
in
hand
like
two
children
waiting
for
what
might
come
it
was
not
until
the
thing
was
over
that
he
told
her
he
had
gone
up
first
and
so
that
she
would
not
happen
on
his
silent
figure
unwarned
had
carried
rené
to
the
open
upper
floor
where
he
lay
singularly
peaceful
face
up
to
the
awful
beauty
of
the
night
good
night
little
brother
henri
said
to
him
and
left
him
there
with
a
heavy
heart
never
again
would
rené
sit
and
whittle
on
the
doorstep
and
sing
his
tuneless
tipperaree
never
again
would
he
gaze
with
boyish
adoring
eyes
at
sara
lee
as
she
moved
back
and
forth
in
the
little
house
henri
stared
up
at
the
sky
the
moon
looked
down
cold
and
cruelly
bright
on
the
vanishing
squadron
of
death
on
the
destroyed
town
and
on
the
boy
white
face
somewhere
henri
felt
vanishing
like
the
german
but
to
peace
instead
of
war
was
moving
rené
brave
and
smiling
spirit
a
boyish
angel
eager
and
dauntless
and
still
looking
up
henri
took
off
his
cap
and
crossed
himself
another
sentry
took
rené
place
the
next
day
but
the
little
house
had
lost
something
it
could
not
regain
and
a
greater
loss
was
to
come
jean
brought
out
the
mail
that
day
for
sara
lee
moving
about
silent
and
there
was
a
letter
from
travers
he
inclosed
a
hundred
pounds
and
a
clipping
from
a
london
newspaper
entitled
the
little
house
of
mercy
evidently
he
wrote
you
were
right
and
we
were
wrong
of
the
inclosed
check
is
from
my
wife
who
takes
this
method
of
showing
her
affectionate
gratitude
the
balance
is
from
myself
once
some
months
ago
i
said
to
you
that
almost
you
restored
my
faith
in
human
nature
i
may
say
that
in
these
hours
of
sorrow
for
us
all
what
you
have
done
and
are
doing
has
brought
into
my
gray
day
a
breath
of
hope
there
was
another
clipping
but
no
comment
it
recorded
the
death
of
a
reginald
alexander
travers
aged
thirty
it
was
then
that
sara
lee
who
was
by
way
of
thinking
for
herself
those
days
and
of
thinking
clearly
recognized
the
strange
new
of
the
english
their
attitude
not
so
much
of
suppressing
their
private
griefs
as
of
refusing
to
obtrude
them
a
strongly
individualistic
people
they
were
already
commencing
to
think
nationally
grief
was
a
private
matter
to
be
borne
privately
to
the
world
they
must
present
an
unbroken
front
an
unshaken
and
unshakable
faith
a
new
attitude
and
a
strange
one
for
grumbling
crochety
england
a
people
who
had
for
centuries
insisted
not
only
on
its
rights
but
on
its
privileges
was
now
giving
as
freely
as
ever
it
had
demanded
it
was
as
though
having
hoarded
all
those
years
it
had
but
been
hoarding
against
the
day
of
payment
as
it
had
received
it
gave
in
money
in
effort
in
life
and
without
pretext
so
the
traverses
having
given
up
all
that
had
made
life
for
them
sent
a
clipping
only
and
no
comment
sara
lee
through
a
mist
of
tears
saw
them
alone
in
their
having
tea
as
usual
and
valiantly
speaking
of
small
things
and
bravely
facing
the
future
but
never
in
the
bitterest
moments
making
complaint
or
protest
would
america
she
wondered
if
her
hour
came
be
so
brave
harvey
had
a
phrase
for
such
things
it
was
stand
the
gaff
would
america
stand
the
gaff
so
well
courage
was
america
watchword
but
a
courage
of
the
body
rather
than
of
the
soul
physical
courage
not
moral
what
would
happen
if
america
entered
the
struggle
and
the
papers
were
filled
as
were
the
british
and
the
french
with
long
casualty
lists
each
name
a
knife
thrust
somewhere
she
wondered
and
then
before
long
it
was
sara
lee
turn
to
stand
the
gaff
there
was
another
letter
a
curiously
incoherent
one
from
harvey
sister
she
referred
to
something
that
the
society
had
done
and
hoped
that
sara
lee
would
take
it
in
kindness
as
it
was
meant
harvey
was
well
and
much
happier
she
was
to
try
to
understand
harvey
part
he
had
been
almost
desperate
evidently
the
letter
had
preceded
one
that
should
have
arrived
at
the
same
time
sara
lee
was
sadly
puzzled
she
went
to
henri
with
it
but
he
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
the
next
night
henri
was
to
go
through
the
lines
again
since
his
wounding
he
had
been
working
on
the
allied
side
and
fewer
lights
there
were
in
his
district
that
flashed
the
treacherous
message
across
the
flood
between
night
and
morning
but
now
it
was
imperative
that
he
go
through
the
german
lines
again
it
was
feared
that
with
grappling
hooks
the
enemy
was
slowly
and
cautiously
withdrawing
the
barbed
wire
from
the
inundated
fields
and
that
could
mean
but
one
thing
on
the
night
he
was
to
go
henri
called
sara
lee
from
the
crowded
à
and
drawing
her
into
the
room
across
closed
the
door
mademoiselle
he
said
gravely
once
before
long
ago
you
permitted
me
to
kiss
you
will
you
do
that
for
me
again
she
kissed
him
at
once
gravely
once
she
would
have
flushed
she
did
not
now
for
there
was
a
change
in
sara
lee
as
well
as
in
her
outlook
she
had
been
seeing
for
months
the
shortness
of
life
the
brief
tenure
men
held
on
it
the
value
of
such
happiness
as
might
be
for
the
hours
that
remained
she
was
a
woman
now
for
all
her
slim
young
body
and
her
charm
of
youth
values
had
changed
to
love
and
to
show
that
love
to
cheer
to
comfort
and
help
that
was
necessary
because
soon
the
chance
might
be
gone
and
there
would
be
long
aching
years
of
regret
so
she
kissed
him
gravely
and
looked
up
into
his
eyes
her
own
full
of
tears
god
bless
and
keep
you
dear
henri
she
said
then
she
went
back
to
her
work
xxii
much
of
sara
lee
life
at
home
had
faded
she
seemed
to
be
two
people
one
was
the
girl
who
had
knitted
the
afghan
for
anna
and
had
hidden
it
away
from
uncle
james
kind
but
curious
eyes
and
one
was
this
present
sara
lee
living
on
the
edge
of
eternity
and
seeing
men
die
or
suffer
horribly
not
to
gain
anything
except
perhaps
some
honorable
advancement
for
their
souls
but
that
there
might
be
preserved
at
any
cost
the
right
of
honest
folk
to
labor
in
their
fields
to
love
to
pray
and
at
last
to
sleep
in
the
peace
of
god
she
had
lost
the
past
and
she
dared
not
look
into
the
future
so
she
was
living
each
day
as
it
came
with
its
labor
its
love
its
prayers
and
at
last
its
sleep
even
harvey
seemed
remote
and
stern
and
bitter
she
reread
his
letters
often
but
they
were
forced
and
after
a
time
she
realized
another
quality
in
them
they
were
it
was
anxiety
loneliness
humiliation
sara
lee
eyes
were
looking
out
those
days
over
a
suffering
world
harvey
eyes
were
turned
in
on
himself
she
realized
this
but
she
never
formulated
it
even
to
herself
what
she
did
acknowledge
was
a
growing
fear
of
the
reunion
which
must
come
sometime
that
he
was
cherishing
still
further
bitterness
against
that
day
that
he
would
say
things
that
he
would
regret
later
sometimes
the
thought
of
that
day
came
to
her
when
she
was
doing
a
dressing
and
her
hands
would
tremble
henri
had
not
returned
when
the
second
day
after
rené
death
the
letter
came
which
recalled
her
she
opened
it
eagerly
though
from
harvey
there
usually
came
at
the
best
veiled
reproach
the
society
had
always
sent
its
enthusiastic
approval
she
read
it
twice
before
she
understood
and
it
was
only
when
she
read
belle
letter
again
that
she
began
to
comprehend
she
was
recalled
and
the
recall
was
harvey
work
she
was
very
close
to
hating
him
that
day
he
had
never
understood
she
would
go
back
to
him
as
she
had
promised
but
always
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
there
would
be
this
barrier
between
them
to
the
barrier
of
his
bitterness
would
be
added
her
own
resentment
she
could
never
even
talk
to
him
of
her
work
of
those
great
days
when
in
her
small
way
she
had
felt
herself
a
part
of
the
machinery
of
mercy
of
the
war
harvey
had
lost
something
out
of
sara
lee
love
for
him
he
had
done
it
himself
madly
despairingly
she
still
loved
him
she
felt
nothing
could
change
that
or
her
promise
to
him
but
with
that
love
there
was
something
now
of
fear
and
she
felt
too
that
after
all
the
years
she
had
known
him
she
had
not
known
him
at
all
the
harvey
she
had
known
was
a
tender
and
considerate
man
slow
to
wrath
always
gentle
but
the
harvey
of
his
letters
and
of
the
recall
was
a
stranger
it
was
the
result
of
her
upbringing
probably
that
she
had
no
thought
of
revolt
her
tie
to
harvey
was
a
real
tie
by
her
promise
to
him
her
life
was
no
longer
hers
to
order
it
belonged
to
some
one
else
to
be
ordered
for
her
but
though
she
accepted
she
was
too
clear
a
thinker
not
to
resent
when
henri
returned
toward
dawn
of
the
following
night
he
did
not
come
alone
sara
lee
rising
early
found
two
men
in
her
kitchen
one
of
them
henri
who
was
making
coffee
and
a
soldier
in
a
uniform
with
a
bad
bruise
over
one
eye
and
a
sulky
face
his
hands
were
tied
but
otherwise
he
sat
at
ease
and
henri
having
made
the
coffee
held
a
cup
to
his
lips
it
is
good
for
the
spirits
man
he
said
in
german
drink
it
the
german
took
it
first
gingerly
then
eagerly
henri
was
in
high
good
humor
see
i
have
brought
you
a
gift
he
exclaimed
on
seeing
sara
lee
what
shall
we
do
with
him
send
him
to
america
to
show
the
appearance
of
the
madmen
of
europe
the
prisoner
was
only
a
boy
such
a
boy
as
henri
himself
but
a
peasant
and
muscular
beside
his
bulk
henri
looked
slim
as
a
reed
henri
eyed
him
with
a
certain
tolerant
humor
he
is
young
and
a
bavarian
he
said
other
wise
i
should
have
killed
him
for
he
fought
hard
he
has
but
just
been
called
there
was
another
conference
in
the
little
house
that
morning
but
henri
prisoner
could
tell
little
he
had
heard
nothing
of
an
advance
further
along
the
line
it
was
said
that
there
was
much
fighting
he
sat
there
pale
and
bewildered
and
very
civil
and
in
the
end
his
frightened
politeness
brought
about
a
change
in
the
attitude
of
the
men
who
questioned
him
hate
all
germans
as
they
must
who
had
suffered
so
grossly
this
boy
was
not
of
those
who
had
outraged
them
they
sent
him
on
at
last
and
sara
lee
was
free
to
tell
henri
her
news
but
she
had
grown
very
wise
as
to
henri
moods
and
she
hesitated
a
certain
dissatisfaction
had
been
growing
in
the
boy
for
some
time
a
sense
of
hopelessness
further
along
the
spring
had
brought
renewed
activity
to
the
allied
armies
great
movements
were
taking
place
but
his
own
men
stood
in
their
trenches
or
what
passed
for
trenches
or
lay
on
their
hours
of
relief
in
such
wretched
quarters
as
could
be
found
still
with
no
prospect
of
action
no
great
guns
drawn
by
heavy
tractors
came
down
the
roads
toward
the
trenches
by
the
sea
steady
bombarding
incessant
sniping
and
no
movement
on
either
side
that
was
the
belgian
front
during
the
first
year
of
the
war
inaction
with
that
eating
anxiety
as
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
occupied
territory
was
the
portion
of
the
heroic
small
army
that
stretched
from
nieuport
to
dixmude
and
henri
nerves
were
not
good
he
was
unhappy
that
always
and
he
was
not
yet
quite
recovered
from
his
wounds
there
was
on
his
mind
too
a
certain
gun
which
moved
on
a
railway
track
back
and
forth
behind
the
german
lines
doing
the
work
of
many
he
had
tried
to
get
to
that
gun
and
failed
and
he
hated
failure
certainly
in
this
story
of
sara
lee
and
of
henri
whose
other
name
must
not
be
known
allowance
must
be
made
for
all
those
things
yet
perhaps
no
allowance
is
enough
sara
lee
told
him
that
evening
of
her
recall
told
him
when
the
shuffling
of
many
feet
in
the
street
told
of
the
first
weary
men
from
the
trenches
coming
up
the
road
he
heard
her
in
a
dazed
silence
then
but
you
will
not
go
he
said
it
is
impossible
you
you
are
needed
mademoiselle
what
can
i
do
henri
they
have
recalled
me
my
money
will
not
come
now
perhaps
we
can
arrange
that
it
does
not
cost
so
much
i
have
friends
and
think
mademoiselle
how
many
know
now
of
what
you
are
doing
and
love
you
for
it
some
of
them
would
contribute
surely
he
was
desperately
revolving
expedients
in
his
mind
he
could
himself
do
no
more
than
he
had
done
he
or
rather
jean
and
he
together
had
been
bearing
a
full
half
of
the
expense
of
the
little
house
since
the
beginning
but
he
dared
not
tell
her
that
and
though
he
spoke
hopefully
he
knew
well
that
he
could
raise
nothing
from
the
belgians
he
knew
best
henri
came
of
a
class
that
held
its
fortunes
in
land
and
that
land
was
now
in
german
hands
we
will
arrange
it
somehow
he
said
with
forced
cheerfulness
no
beautiful
thing
and
this
is
surely
beautiful
must
die
because
of
money
it
was
then
that
sara
lee
took
the
plunge
it
is
not
only
money
henri
he
has
sent
for
you
harvey
was
always
he
to
henri
not
exactly
but
i
think
he
went
to
some
one
and
said
i
should
not
be
here
alone
you
can
understand
how
he
feels
we
were
going
to
be
married
very
soon
and
then
i
decided
to
come
it
made
an
awful
upset
henri
stood
with
folded
arms
and
listened
at
first
he
said
nothing
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
voice
of
ominous
calm
so
for
a
stupid
convention
he
would
destroy
this
beautiful
thing
you
have
made
does
he
know
your
work
does
he
know
what
you
are
to
the
men
here
have
you
ever
told
him
i
have
of
course
but
do
you
want
to
go
back
no
henri
not
yet
i
that
is
enough
you
are
needed
you
are
willing
to
stay
i
shall
attend
to
the
money
it
is
arranged
you
do
understand
said
sara
lee
desperately
i
am
engaged
to
him
i
ca
wreck
his
life
can
i
would
it
wreck
your
life
he
demanded
tell
me
that
and
i
shall
know
how
to
reason
with
you
but
she
only
looked
at
him
helplessly
heavy
tramping
in
the
passage
told
of
the
arrival
of
the
first
men
they
did
not
talk
and
laugh
as
usual
as
well
as
they
could
they
came
quietly
for
rené
had
been
a
good
friend
to
many
of
them
and
had
admitted
on
slack
nights
many
a
weary
man
who
had
no
ticket
much
as
the
neighbors
had
entered
the
house
back
home
after
uncle
james
had
gone
away
came
these
bearded
men
that
night
and
sara
lee
hearing
their
muffled
voices
brushed
a
hand
over
her
eyes
and
tried
to
smile
we
can
talk
about
it
later
she
said
we
must
quarrel
i
owe
so
much
to
you
henri
suddenly
henri
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
turned
her
about
so
that
she
faced
the
lamp
do
you
love
him
he
demanded
sara
lee
look
at
me
only
he
pronounced
it
saralie
he
has
done
a
very
cruel
thing
do
you
still
love
him
sara
lee
shut
her
eyes
i
do
know
i
think
i
do
he
is
very
unhappy
and
it
is
my
fault
your
fault
i
must
go
henri
the
men
are
waiting
but
he
still
held
her
arm
does
he
love
you
as
i
love
you
he
demanded
would
he
die
for
you
that
rather
silly
is
it
men
do
die
for
the
people
they
love
i
would
die
for
you
saralie
she
eyed
him
rather
helplessly
i
do
think
you
mean
that
bad
strategy
that
for
he
drew
her
to
him
his
arms
were
like
steel
and
it
was
a
rebellious
and
very
rigid
sara
lee
who
found
she
could
not
free
herself
i
would
die
for
you
saralie
he
repeated
fiercely
that
would
be
easier
far
than
living
without
you
there
is
nothing
that
matters
but
you
listen
i
would
put
everything
i
have
my
honor
my
life
my
hope
of
eternity
on
one
side
of
the
scale
and
you
on
the
other
and
i
would
choose
you
is
that
love
he
freed
her
it
insanity
said
sara
lee
angrily
you
do
mean
it
and
i
do
want
that
kind
of
love
if
that
is
what
you
call
it
and
you
will
go
back
to
that
man
who
loves
himself
better
than
he
loves
you
that
not
true
she
flashed
at
him
he
is
sending
for
me
not
to
get
me
back
to
him
but
to
get
me
back
to
safety
what
sort
of
safety
henri
demanded
in
an
ominous
tone
is
he
afraid
of
me
he
does
know
anything
about
you
you
have
never
told
him
why
his
eyes
narrowed
he
would
have
understood
henri
you
are
going
back
to
him
he
said
slowly
and
you
will
always
keep
these
days
of
ours
buried
in
your
heart
is
that
it
his
eyes
softened
i
am
to
be
a
memory
do
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
you
care
for
me
more
than
you
know
we
have
lived
a
lifetime
together
in
these
months
you
know
me
better
than
you
know
him
already
we
have
faced
death
together
that
is
a
strong
tie
and
i
have
held
you
in
my
arms
do
you
think
you
can
forget
that
i
shall
never
want
to
forget
you
i
shall
not
let
you
forget
me
you
may
go
i
can
not
prevent
that
perhaps
but
wherever
i
am
saralie
i
shall
stand
between
that
lover
of
yours
and
you
and
sometime
i
shall
come
from
this
other
side
of
the
world
and
i
shall
find
you
and
you
will
come
back
with
me
back
to
this
country
our
country
they
were
boyish
words
but
back
of
them
was
the
iron
determination
of
a
man
his
eyes
seemed
sunken
in
his
head
his
face
was
white
but
there
was
almost
a
prophetic
ring
in
his
voice
sara
lee
went
out
and
left
him
there
went
out
rather
terrified
and
bewildered
and
refusing
absolutely
to
look
into
her
own
heart
xxiii
late
in
may
she
started
for
home
it
had
not
been
necessary
to
close
the
little
house
an
englishwoman
of
mature
years
and
considerable
wealth
hearing
from
travers
of
sara
lee
recall
went
out
a
day
or
two
before
she
left
and
took
charge
she
was
a
kindly
woman
in
deep
mourning
and
some
of
the
ache
left
sara
lee
heart
when
she
had
talked
with
her
successor
perhaps
too
cameron
understood
some
of
the
things
that
had
puzzled
her
before
she
had
been
a
trifle
skeptical
perhaps
about
sara
lee
before
she
saw
her
a
young
girl
alone
among
an
army
of
men
she
was
a
good
woman
herself
and
not
given
to
harsh
judgments
but
the
thing
had
seemed
odd
but
sara
lee
in
her
little
house
as
virginal
as
without
as
a
child
sara
lee
with
her
shabby
clothes
and
her
stained
hands
and
her
honest
eyes
this
was
not
only
a
good
girl
this
was
a
brave
and
and
idealistic
woman
and
after
an
evening
in
the
house
of
mercy
with
the
soldiers
openly
adoring
and
entirely
respectful
cameron
put
her
arms
round
sara
lee
and
kissed
her
you
must
let
me
thank
you
she
said
you
have
made
me
feel
what
i
have
not
felt
since
she
stopped
her
mourning
was
only
a
month
old
i
see
that
after
all
many
things
may
be
gone
but
that
while
service
remains
there
is
something
worth
while
in
life
the
next
day
she
asked
sara
lee
to
stay
with
her
at
least
through
the
summer
sara
lee
hesitated
but
at
last
she
agreed
to
cable
as
henri
had
disappeared
with
the
arrival
of
cameron
it
was
that
chauffeur
who
took
the
message
to
dunkirk
and
sent
it
off
she
had
sent
the
cable
to
harvey
it
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
the
ladies
aid
it
was
between
harvey
and
herself
the
reply
came
on
the
second
day
it
was
curt
and
decisive
now
or
never
was
the
message
harvey
sent
out
of
his
black
despair
across
the
atlantic
to
the
little
house
so
close
under
the
guns
of
belgium
henri
was
half
mad
those
last
days
jean
tried
to
counsel
him
but
he
was
irritable
almost
savage
and
jean
understood
the
girl
had
grown
deep
into
his
own
heart
like
henri
he
believed
that
she
was
going
back
to
unhappiness
he
even
said
so
to
her
in
the
car
on
that
last
sad
day
when
sara
lee
having
visited
rené
grave
and
prayed
in
the
ruined
church
said
to
the
little
house
and
went
away
tearless
at
the
last
because
she
was
too
sad
for
tears
it
was
not
for
some
time
that
jean
spoke
what
was
in
his
mind
and
when
he
had
done
so
she
turned
to
him
gravely
you
are
wrong
jean
he
is
the
kindest
of
men
once
i
am
back
and
safe
he
will
be
very
different
i
afraid
i
given
you
a
wrong
impression
of
him
you
think
then
mademoiselle
that
he
will
forget
all
these
months
he
will
never
be
unhappy
over
them
why
should
he
said
sara
lee
proudly
when
i
tell
him
everything
he
will
understand
and
he
will
be
very
proud
that
i
have
done
my
share
but
jean
one
eye
was
dubious
at
the
wharf
in
dunkirk
they
found
henri
a
pale
but
composed
henri
jean
brows
contracted
he
had
thought
that
the
boy
would
follow
his
advice
and
stay
away
but
henri
was
there
it
was
as
well
perhaps
for
sara
lee
had
brought
him
a
letter
one
of
those
missives
from
the
trenches
which
had
been
so
often
left
at
the
little
house
henri
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
without
reading
it
everything
is
prepared
he
said
it
is
the
british
admiralty
boat
and
one
of
the
officers
has
offered
his
cabin
you
will
be
quite
comfortable
he
appeared
entirely
calm
he
saw
to
carrying
sara
lee
small
bag
on
board
he
chatted
with
the
officers
he
even
wandered
over
to
a
hospital
ship
moored
near
by
and
exchanged
civilities
with
a
wounded
man
in
a
chair
on
the
deck
perhaps
he
swaggered
a
bit
too
much
for
jean
watched
him
with
some
anxiety
he
saw
that
the
boy
was
taking
it
hard
his
eyes
were
very
sunken
now
and
he
moved
his
right
arm
stiffly
as
though
the
old
wound
troubled
him
jean
did
not
like
particularly
he
did
not
like
taking
leave
of
sara
lee
some
time
before
the
boat
sailed
he
kissed
her
hand
and
then
patted
it
and
went
away
in
the
car
without
looking
back
the
boat
was
preparing
to
get
under
way
henri
was
standing
by
her
very
quietly
he
had
not
slept
the
night
before
but
then
there
were
many
nights
when
henri
did
not
sleep
he
had
wandered
about
smoking
incessantly
trying
to
picture
the
black
future
he
could
see
no
hope
anywhere
america
was
far
away
and
peaceful
very
soon
the
tranquillity
of
it
all
would
make
the
last
months
seem
dreamlike
and
unreal
she
would
forget
belgium
forget
him
or
she
would
remember
him
as
a
soldier
who
had
once
loved
her
once
loved
her
because
she
had
never
seemed
to
realize
the
lasting
quality
of
his
love
she
had
always
felt
that
he
would
forget
her
if
he
could
only
make
her
believe
that
he
would
not
it
would
not
be
so
hopeless
he
had
written
a
bit
of
a
love
letter
on
the
little
table
at
dunkirk
that
morning
written
it
with
the
hope
that
the
sight
of
the
written
words
might
carry
conviction
where
all
his
protests
had
failed
i
shall
love
you
all
the
years
of
my
life
he
wrote
at
any
time
in
any
place
you
may
come
to
me
and
know
that
i
am
waiting
great
love
like
this
comes
only
once
to
any
man
and
once
come
to
him
it
never
goes
away
at
any
time
in
the
years
to
come
you
may
know
with
certainty
that
you
are
still
to
me
what
you
are
now
the
love
of
my
life
sometimes
i
think
dearest
i
may
call
you
that
once
now
that
you
have
left
me
that
far
away
you
will
hear
this
call
of
mine
and
come
back
to
me
perhaps
you
will
never
come
perhaps
i
shall
not
live
i
feel
that
i
do
not
care
greatly
to
live
if
that
is
to
be
then
think
of
me
somewhere
perhaps
with
rené
by
my
side
since
he
too
loved
you
and
i
shall
still
be
calling
you
and
waiting
perhaps
even
beyond
the
stars
they
have
need
of
a
little
house
of
mercy
and
god
knows
wherever
i
am
i
shall
have
need
of
you
he
had
the
letter
in
the
pocket
of
his
tunic
and
at
last
the
moment
came
when
the
boat
must
leave
suddenly
henri
knew
that
he
could
not
allow
her
to
cross
to
england
alone
the
last
few
days
had
brought
many
stories
of
submarine
attacks
here
so
far
north
the
germans
were
particularly
active
they
had
for
a
long
time
lurked
in
waiting
for
this
british
admiralty
boat
with
its
valuable
cargo
its
officers
and
the
government
officials
who
used
it
henri
said
sara
lee
i
of
course
it
is
no
use
to
try
to
tell
you
i
am
going
across
with
you
but
i
allowed
you
to
come
over
alone
i
shiver
when
i
think
of
it
i
shall
take
you
back
myself
is
it
very
dangerous
probably
not
but
can
you
think
of
me
standing
safe
on
that
quay
and
letting
you
go
into
danger
alone
i
am
not
afraid
i
know
that
i
have
never
seen
you
afraid
but
if
you
wish
to
see
a
coward
look
at
me
i
am
a
coward
for
you
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
it
occurred
to
him
to
give
her
the
letter
now
so
that
if
anything
happened
she
would
at
least
have
had
it
he
wanted
no
mistake
about
that
appointment
beyond
the
stars
but
the
great
world
of
eternity
was
very
large
and
they
must
have
a
definite
understanding
about
that
meeting
at
the
little
house
of
mercy
over
there
perhaps
he
had
a
little
fever
that
day
he
was
alternately
flushed
and
pale
and
certainly
he
was
not
quite
rational
his
hand
shook
as
he
brought
out
her
letter
and
with
it
the
other
letter
from
the
front
have
you
the
time
to
come
with
me
sara
lee
asked
doubtfully
i
want
you
to
come
of
course
but
if
your
work
will
suffer
he
held
out
his
letter
to
her
i
shall
go
away
he
said
while
you
read
it
and
perhaps
you
will
not
destroy
it
because
i
should
like
to
feel
that
you
have
it
always
he
went
away
at
once
saluting
as
he
passed
other
officers
who
gravely
saluted
him
on
the
deck
of
the
hospital
ship
the
invalid
touched
his
cap
word
was
going
about
in
the
stealthy
manner
of
such
things
that
henri
whose
family
name
we
may
not
know
was
a
brave
man
and
doing
brave
things
the
steamer
had
not
yet
cast
off
as
usual
it
was
to
take
a
flying
start
from
the
harbor
for
it
was
just
outside
the
harbor
that
the
wolves
of
the
sea
lay
in
wait
henri
alone
at
last
opened
his
letter
and
stood
staring
at
it
there
was
again
movement
behind
the
german
line
a
matter
to
be
looked
into
as
only
he
could
do
it
probably
nothing
as
before
but
who
could
say
henri
looked
along
the
shore
to
where
but
a
few
miles
away
lay
the
ragged
remnant
of
his
country
and
he
looked
forward
to
where
sara
lee
his
letter
in
her
hand
was
staring
blindly
at
nothing
then
he
looked
out
toward
the
sea
where
lay
who
knew
what
dangers
of
death
and
suffering
after
that
first
moment
of
indecision
he
never
hesitated
he
stood
on
the
deck
and
watched
rather
frozen
and
rigid
and
with
a
mind
that
had
ceased
working
while
the
steamer
warped
out
from
the
quay
if
in
his
subconsciousness
there
was
any
thought
it
was
doubtless
that
he
had
done
his
best
for
a
long
time
and
that
he
had
earned
the
right
to
protect
for
a
few
hours
the
girl
he
loved
that
too
there
had
been
activity
along
the
line
before
without
result
perhaps
subconsciously
those
things
were
there
he
himself
was
conscious
of
no
thought
of
only
a
dogged
determination
to
get
sara
lee
across
the
channel
safely
he
put
everything
else
behind
him
he
counted
no
cost
the
little
admiralty
boat
sped
on
in
the
bow
on
the
bridge
and
at
different
stations
lookouts
kept
watch
the
lifeboats
were
hung
overboard
ready
to
lower
instantly
on
the
horizon
a
british
destroyer
steamed
leisurely
henri
stood
for
a
long
time
on
the
deck
the
land
fell
away
quickly
from
a
clear
silhouette
of
the
town
against
the
sky
the
dunes
the
spire
of
the
cathedral
the
roof
of
the
it
became
vague
shadowy
the
height
of
a
hand
a
line
nothing
henri
roused
himself
he
was
very
thirsty
and
the
wound
in
his
arm
ached
when
he
raised
his
hand
to
salute
the
movement
was
painful
it
was
a
very
grave
sara
lee
he
found
in
the
officer
cabin
when
he
went
inside
later
on
she
was
sitting
on
the
long
seat
below
the
open
port
her
hat
slightly
askew
and
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
her
bag
was
beside
her
and
there
was
in
her
eyes
a
perplexity
henri
was
too
wretched
to
notice
for
the
first
time
sara
lee
was
realizing
the
full
value
of
the
thing
she
was
throwing
away
she
had
persistently
discounted
it
until
now
she
had
been
grateful
for
it
she
had
felt
unworthy
of
it
but
now
on
the
edge
of
leaving
it
she
felt
that
something
infinitely
precious
and
very
beautiful
was
going
out
of
her
life
she
had
already
a
sense
of
loss
for
the
first
time
too
she
was
allowing
herself
to
think
of
certain
contingencies
that
were
now
forever
impossible
for
instance
suppose
she
had
stayed
with
cameron
suppose
she
had
broken
her
promise
to
harvey
and
remained
at
the
little
house
suppose
she
had
done
as
henri
had
so
wildly
urged
her
and
had
broken
entirely
with
harvey
would
she
have
married
henri
there
was
a
certain
element
of
caution
in
the
girl
it
made
the
chances
she
had
taken
rather
more
courageous
indeed
because
she
had
always
counted
the
cost
but
marriage
was
not
a
matter
for
taking
chances
one
should
know
not
only
the
man
but
his
setting
though
she
would
not
have
thought
of
it
in
that
way
not
only
the
man
but
the
things
that
made
up
his
life
his
people
his
home
and
henri
was
to
her
still
a
figure
not
so
much
now
of
mystery
as
of
detachment
except
jean
he
had
no
intimates
he
had
no
family
on
the
only
side
of
the
line
she
knew
he
had
not
even
a
country
she
had
reached
that
point
when
henri
came
below
and
saluted
her
stiffly
from
the
doorway
henri
she
said
i
believe
you
are
ill
i
am
not
ill
he
said
and
threw
himself
into
the
corner
of
the
seat
you
have
read
it
she
nodded
even
thinking
of
it
brought
a
lump
into
her
throat
he
bent
forward
but
he
did
not
touch
her
i
meant
it
saralie
he
said
sometimes
men
are
infatuated
and
write
what
they
do
not
mean
they
are
sincere
at
the
time
and
then
later
on
but
i
meant
it
i
shall
always
mean
it
not
then
nor
during
the
three
days
in
london
did
he
so
much
as
take
her
hand
he
was
not
well
he
ate
nothing
and
at
night
he
lay
awake
and
drank
a
great
deal
of
water
once
or
twice
he
found
her
looking
at
him
anxiously
but
he
disclaimed
all
illness
he
had
known
from
the
beginning
what
he
was
doing
but
he
did
not
touch
her
because
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
where
once
he
had
been
worthy
he
was
no
longer
worthy
he
had
left
his
work
for
a
woman
it
is
true
that
he
had
expected
to
go
back
at
once
but
the
which
had
been
listed
to
sail
the
next
day
was
held
up
by
a
strike
in
liverpool
and
he
waited
on
taking
such
hours
as
she
could
give
him
feverishly
anxious
to
make
her
happy
buying
her
little
gifts
mostly
flowers
which
she
wore
tucked
in
her
belt
and
smiled
over
because
she
had
never
before
received
flowers
from
a
man
he
was
alternately
gay
and
silent
they
walked
across
the
thames
by
the
parliament
buildings
and
midway
across
he
stopped
and
looked
long
at
the
stream
and
they
went
to
the
zoölogical
gardens
where
he
gravely
named
one
of
the
sea
lions
for
colonel
lilias
because
of
its
mustache
and
insisted
on
saluting
it
each
time
before
he
flung
it
a
fish
once
he
soberly
gathered
up
a
very
new
baby
camel
all
legs
in
his
arms
and
presented
it
to
her
please
accept
it
mademoiselle
he
said
with
my
compliments
they
dined
together
every
night
very
modestly
sitting
in
some
crowded
restaurant
perhaps
but
seeing
little
but
each
other
sara
lee
had
bought
a
new
hat
in
london
black
of
course
but
faced
with
white
he
adored
her
in
it
he
would
sit
for
long
moments
his
elbows
propped
on
the
table
his
blond
hair
gleaming
in
the
candlelight
and
watch
her
i
wonder
he
said
once
if
you
had
never
met
him
would
you
have
loved
me
i
do
love
you
henri
i
do
want
that
sort
of
love
and
he
had
turned
his
head
away
but
one
evening
he
called
for
her
at
morley
a
white
and
crushed
boy
needing
all
that
she
could
give
him
and
much
more
he
came
as
a
man
goes
to
the
woman
he
loves
when
he
is
in
trouble
much
as
a
child
to
his
mother
sara
lee
coming
down
to
the
reception
room
found
him
alone
there
walking
rapidly
up
and
down
he
turned
desperate
eyes
on
her
i
have
brought
bad
news
he
said
abruptly
the
little
house
i
do
not
know
i
ran
away
mademoiselle
i
am
a
traitor
and
the
germans
broke
through
last
night
henri
they
broke
through
we
were
not
ready
that
is
what
i
have
done
do
you
think
sara
lee
said
in
a
frozen
voice
that
is
what
i
have
done
i
let
you
come
you
you
are
taking
the
blame
mademoiselle
i
have
enough
to
bear
without
that
he
explained
further
still
standing
in
his
rigid
attitude
if
he
had
been
white
before
at
times
he
was
ghastly
now
it
had
not
been
an
attack
in
force
a
small
number
had
got
across
and
had
penetrated
beyond
the
railway
line
there
had
been
fighting
in
the
road
beyond
the
poplars
but
it
looked
more
like
an
experiment
an
endeavor
to
discover
the
possibility
of
a
real
advance
through
the
inundation
or
perhaps
a
feint
to
cover
operations
elsewhere
for
every
life
lost
i
am
responsible
he
ended
in
a
flat
and
lifeless
tone
but
you
might
not
have
known
she
protested
wildly
even
if
you
had
been
there
henri
you
might
not
have
known
she
knew
something
of
war
by
that
time
how
could
you
have
told
that
a
small
movement
of
troops
was
to
take
place
i
should
have
been
there
but
if
they
came
without
warning
i
did
not
tell
you
he
said
looking
away
from
her
there
had
been
a
warning
i
disregarded
it
he
went
back
to
belgium
that
night
sara
lee
at
the
last
held
out
her
hand
she
was
terrified
for
him
and
she
showed
it
i
shall
not
touch
your
hand
he
said
i
have
forfeited
my
right
to
do
that
then
seeing
what
was
in
her
face
he
reassured
her
i
shall
not
do
he
said
it
would
be
easier
but
i
shall
have
to
go
back
and
see
what
can
be
done
he
was
the
old
henri
to
the
last
however
he
went
carefully
over
her
steamship
ticket
and
inquired
with
equal
care
into
the
amount
of
money
she
had
it
will
take
you
home
he
asked
very
comfortably
henri
it
seems
very
little
then
he
said
apropos
of
nothing
poor
jean
when
he
left
her
at
last
he
went
to
the
door
very
erect
and
soldierly
but
he
turned
there
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
her
as
though
through
all
that
was
coming
he
must
have
with
him
to
give
him
strength
that
final
picture
of
her
the
elderly
chambermaid
coming
into
sara
lee
room
the
next
morning
found
her
fully
dressed
in
the
frock
she
had
worn
the
night
before
face
down
on
her
bed
xxiv
it
was
early
in
june
when
at
last
the
lights
went
down
behind
the
back
drop
and
came
up
in
front
to
show
sara
lee
knitting
again
though
not
by
the
fire
the
amazing
interlude
was
over
over
except
in
sara
lee
heart
the
voyage
had
been
a
nightmare
she
had
been
ill
for
one
thing
a
combination
of
seasickness
and
heartsickness
she
had
allowed
henri
to
come
to
england
with
her
and
the
germans
had
broken
through
all
the
good
she
had
done
and
she
had
helped
was
nothing
to
this
mischief
she
had
wrought
it
had
been
a
small
raid
she
gathered
that
from
the
papers
on
board
but
that
was
not
the
vital
thing
what
mattered
was
that
she
had
let
a
man
forget
his
duty
to
his
country
in
his
solicitude
for
her
but
as
the
days
went
on
the
excitement
of
her
return
dulled
the
edge
of
her
misery
somewhat
the
thing
was
done
she
could
do
only
one
thing
to
help
she
would
never
go
back
never
again
bring
trouble
and
suffering
where
she
had
meant
only
to
bring
aid
and
comfort
she
had
a
faint
hope
that
harvey
would
meet
her
at
the
pier
she
needed
comforting
and
soothing
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
praise
she
was
so
very
tired
depressed
too
if
the
truth
be
known
she
needed
a
hand
to
lead
her
back
to
her
old
place
on
the
stage
and
kind
faces
to
make
her
forget
that
she
had
ever
gone
away
because
that
was
what
she
had
to
do
she
must
forget
henri
and
the
little
house
on
the
road
to
the
poplar
trees
and
most
of
all
she
must
forget
that
because
of
her
henri
had
let
the
germans
through
but
harvey
did
not
meet
her
there
was
a
telegram
saying
he
would
meet
her
train
if
she
wired
when
she
was
leaving
an
exultant
message
breathing
forgiveness
and
signed
with
much
love
she
flushed
when
she
read
it
of
course
he
could
not
meet
her
in
new
york
this
was
not
the
continent
in
wartime
where
convention
had
died
of
a
great
necessity
and
he
was
not
angry
after
all
a
great
wave
of
relief
swept
over
her
but
it
was
odd
how
helpless
she
felt
since
her
arrival
in
england
months
before
there
had
always
been
henri
to
look
after
things
for
her
it
was
incredible
to
recall
how
little
she
had
done
for
herself
was
she
glad
to
be
back
she
did
not
ask
herself
it
was
as
though
the
voyage
had
automatically
detached
her
from
that
other
sara
lee
of
the
little
house
that
was
behind
her
a
dream
a
mirage
or
a
memory
here
a
trifle
confused
by
the
bustle
was
once
again
the
sara
lee
who
had
knitted
for
anna
and
tended
the
plants
in
the
window
and
watched
uncle
james
slowly
lowered
into
his
quiet
grave
part
of
her
detachment
was
voluntary
she
could
not
bear
to
remember
she
had
but
to
close
her
eyes
to
see
henri
tragic
face
that
last
night
at
morley
and
part
of
the
detachment
was
because
after
all
the
interlude
had
been
but
a
matter
of
months
and
reaching
out
familiar
hands
to
her
were
the
habits
and
customs
and
surroundings
of
all
the
earlier
years
of
her
life
drawing
her
back
to
them
it
was
strange
how
henri
face
haunted
her
she
could
close
her
eyes
and
see
it
line
by
line
his
very
swagger
for
he
did
swagger
just
a
little
his
tall
figure
and
unruly
hair
his
long
narrow
muscular
hands
strange
and
rather
uncomfortable
because
she
could
not
summon
harvey
image
at
all
she
tried
to
bring
before
her
that
night
in
the
train
speeding
west
his
solid
figure
and
kind
eyes
as
they
would
greet
her
the
next
day
tried
and
failed
all
she
got
was
the
profile
of
the
photograph
and
the
stubborn
angle
of
the
jaw
she
was
up
very
early
the
next
morning
and
it
was
then
as
the
train
rolled
through
familiar
country
that
she
began
to
find
harvey
again
a
flush
of
tenderness
warmed
her
she
must
be
very
kind
to
him
because
of
all
that
he
had
suffered
the
train
came
to
a
stop
rather
breathless
sara
lee
went
out
on
the
platform
harvey
was
there
in
the
crowd
he
did
not
see
her
at
first
he
was
looking
toward
the
front
of
the
train
so
her
first
glimpse
of
him
was
the
view
of
the
photograph
his
hat
was
off
and
his
hair
carefully
brushed
back
gave
him
the
eager
look
of
the
picture
he
was
a
strong
and
manly
figure
as
unlike
henri
as
an
oak
is
unlike
one
of
henri
own
tall
and
swaying
poplars
sara
lee
drew
a
long
breath
here
after
all
were
rest
and
peace
love
and
gentleness
quiet
days
and
still
evenings
no
more
crowds
and
wounds
and
weary
men
no
more
great
thunderings
of
guns
no
imminence
of
death
rest
and
peace
then
harvey
saw
her
and
the
gleam
of
happiness
and
relief
in
his
eyes
made
her
own
eyes
misty
she
saw
even
in
that
first
glance
that
he
looked
thinner
and
older
a
pang
of
remorse
shot
through
her
was
happiness
always
bought
at
the
cost
of
happiness
did
one
always
take
away
in
order
to
give
not
in
so
many
words
but
in
a
flash
of
doubt
the
thought
went
through
her
mind
there
was
no
reserve
in
harvey
embrace
he
put
his
arms
about
her
and
held
her
close
he
did
not
speak
at
first
then
my
own
little
girl
he
said
my
own
little
girl
suddenly
sara
lee
was
very
happy
all
her
doubts
were
swept
away
by
his
voice
his
arms
there
was
no
thrill
for
her
in
his
caress
but
there
were
peace
and
quiet
joy
it
was
enough
for
her
just
then
that
she
had
brought
back
some
of
the
happiness
she
had
robbed
him
of
oh
harvey
she
said
i
glad
to
be
back
again
with
you
he
held
her
off
then
and
looked
at
her
you
are
thin
he
said
you
not
pale
but
you
are
thin
and
in
a
harder
voice
what
did
they
do
to
you
over
there
but
he
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
he
did
not
seem
to
want
one
he
picked
up
her
bag
and
guiding
her
by
the
elbow
piloted
her
through
the
crowd
a
lot
of
folks
wanted
to
come
and
meet
you
he
said
but
i
steered
them
off
you
have
thought
roosevelt
was
coming
to
town
the
way
they
been
calling
up
to
meet
me
i
expect
the
ladies
aid
society
wanted
to
get
into
the
papers
again
he
said
rather
grimly
they
are
merry
little
advertisers
all
right
i
do
think
that
harvey
well
i
do
he
said
and
brought
her
to
a
stop
facing
a
smart
little
car
very
new
very
gay
how
do
you
like
it
he
asked
like
it
why
it
not
yours
is
it
surest
thing
you
know
or
rather
it
ours
had
a
few
war
babies
and
they
grew
up
sara
lee
looked
at
it
and
for
just
an
instant
a
rather
sickening
instant
she
saw
henri
shattered
low
car
and
broken
it
lovely
said
sara
lee
and
harvey
found
no
fault
with
her
tone
sara
lee
had
intended
to
go
to
anna
for
a
time
at
least
but
she
found
that
belle
was
expecting
her
and
would
not
take
no
she
moved
the
baby
in
with
the
others
harvey
explained
as
he
took
the
wheel
wait
until
you
see
your
room
i
knew
we
be
buying
furniture
soon
so
i
fixed
it
up
he
said
nothing
for
a
time
he
was
new
to
driving
a
car
and
the
traffic
engrossed
him
but
when
they
had
reached
a
quieter
neighborhood
he
put
a
hand
over
hers
good
god
how
i
been
hungry
for
you
he
said
i
guess
i
was
pretty
nearly
crazy
sometimes
he
glanced
at
her
apprehensively
but
if
she
knew
his
connection
with
her
recall
she
showed
no
resentment
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
in
his
voice
something
that
reminded
her
of
henri
the
same
deeper
note
almost
husky
she
was
indeed
asking
herself
very
earnestly
what
was
there
in
her
of
all
people
that
should
make
two
men
care
for
her
as
both
henri
and
harvey
cared
in
the
humility
of
all
modest
women
she
was
bewildered
it
made
her
rather
silent
and
a
little
sad
she
was
so
far
from
being
what
they
thought
her
harvey
stealing
a
moment
from
the
car
to
glance
at
her
saw
something
baffling
in
her
face
do
you
still
care
sara
lee
he
asked
almost
diffidently
as
much
as
ever
i
have
come
back
to
you
she
said
after
an
imperceptible
pause
well
i
guess
that
the
answer
he
drew
a
deep
satisfied
breath
i
used
to
think
of
you
over
there
and
all
those
foreigners
in
uniform
strutting
about
and
it
almost
got
me
some
times
and
again
as
long
before
he
read
into
her
passivity
his
own
passion
and
was
deeply
content
belle
was
waiting
on
the
small
front
porch
there
was
an
anxious
frown
on
her
face
and
she
looked
first
not
at
sara
lee
but
at
harvey
what
she
saw
there
evidently
satisfied
her
for
the
frown
disappeared
she
kissed
sara
lee
impulsively
all
that
afternoon
much
to
harvey
resentment
sara
lee
received
callers
the
ladies
aid
came
en
masse
and
went
out
to
the
and
there
had
tea
and
cake
harvey
disappeared
when
they
came
you
are
back
he
said
and
safe
and
all
that
but
it
not
their
fault
and
i
be
hanged
if
i
stand
round
and
listen
to
them
he
got
his
hat
and
then
finding
her
alone
in
a
back
hall
for
a
moment
reverted
uneasily
to
the
subject
there
are
two
sides
to
every
story
he
said
they
going
to
knife
me
this
afternoon
all
right
damned
hypocrites
you
just
keep
your
head
and
i
tell
you
my
side
of
it
later
harvey
she
said
slowly
i
want
to
know
now
just
what
you
did
not
angry
i
never
been
angry
but
i
ought
to
know
it
was
a
very
story
that
harvey
told
her
standing
in
the
little
back
hall
with
belle
children
hanging
over
the
staircase
and
begging
for
cake
yet
in
the
main
it
was
true
he
had
reached
his
limit
of
endurance
she
was
in
danger
as
the
photograph
plainly
showed
and
a
fellow
had
a
right
to
fight
for
his
own
happiness
i
wanted
you
back
that
all
he
ended
and
added
an
anticlimax
by
passing
a
plate
of
sliced
jelly
roll
through
the
stair
rail
to
the
clamoring
children
sara
lee
stood
there
for
a
moment
after
he
had
gone
he
was
right
or
at
least
he
had
been
within
his
rights
she
had
never
even
heard
of
the
new
doctrine
of
liberty
for
women
there
was
nothing
in
her
training
to
teach
her
revolt
she
was
engaged
to
harvey
already
potentially
she
belonged
to
him
he
had
interfered
with
her
life
but
he
had
had
the
right
to
interfere
and
also
there
was
in
the
back
of
her
mind
a
feeling
that
was
almost
guilt
she
had
let
henri
tell
her
he
loved
her
she
had
even
kissed
him
and
there
had
been
many
times
in
the
little
house
when
harvey
for
days
at
a
time
had
not
even
entered
her
thoughts
there
was
therefore
a
very
real
tenderness
in
the
face
she
lifted
for
his
kiss
to
belle
in
the
front
hall
harvey
gave
a
firm
order
do
let
any
reporters
in
he
said
warningly
this
is
strictly
our
affair
it
a
private
matter
it
nobody
business
what
she
did
over
there
she
home
that
all
that
matters
belle
assented
but
she
was
uneasy
she
knew
that
harvey
was
unreasonably
madly
jealous
of
sara
lee
work
at
the
little
house
of
mercy
and
she
knew
him
well
enough
to
know
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
show
that
jealousy
she
felt
too
that
the
girl
should
have
been
allowed
her
small
triumph
without
interference
there
had
been
interference
enough
already
but
it
was
easier
to
yield
to
harvey
than
to
argue
with
him
it
was
rather
a
worried
belle
who
served
tea
that
afternoon
in
her
dining
room
with
gregory
pouring
the
more
uneasy
because
already
she
divined
a
change
in
sara
lee
she
was
as
lovely
as
ever
even
lovelier
but
she
had
a
poise
a
steadiness
that
were
new
and
silences
in
which
to
belle
shrewd
eyes
she
seemed
to
be
weighing
things
reporters
clamored
to
see
sara
lee
that
day
and
failing
to
see
her
telephoned
harvey
at
his
office
to
ask
if
it
was
true
that
she
had
been
decorated
by
the
king
he
was
short
to
the
point
of
affront
i
have
heard
anything
about
it
he
snapped
and
i
would
say
if
i
had
but
it
not
likely
what
fellows
think
she
was
doing
anyhow
leading
a
charge
she
was
running
a
soup
kitchen
that
all
he
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
jerk
but
shortly
after
that
he
fell
to
pacing
his
small
office
she
had
not
said
anything
about
being
decorated
but
the
reporters
had
said
it
had
been
in
a
london
newspaper
if
she
had
not
told
him
that
there
were
probably
many
things
she
had
not
told
him
but
of
course
there
had
been
very
little
time
he
would
see
if
she
mentioned
it
that
night
sara
lee
had
had
a
hard
day
the
children
loved
her
in
the
intervals
of
calls
they
crawled
over
her
and
the
littlest
one
called
her
saralie
she
held
the
child
in
her
arms
close
saralie
said
the
child
over
and
over
saralie
that
your
name
i
love
your
name
and
there
came
echoing
in
her
ears
henri
and
his
tender
saralie
there
was
an
oppression
on
her
too
her
very
bedroom
thrust
on
her
her
approaching
marriage
this
was
her
own
furniture
for
her
new
home
it
was
beautiful
simple
and
good
but
she
was
not
ready
for
marriage
she
had
been
too
close
to
the
great
struggle
to
be
prepared
to
think
in
terms
of
peace
so
soon
perhaps
had
she
dared
to
look
deeper
than
that
she
would
have
found
something
else
a
something
she
had
not
counted
on
she
and
belle
had
a
little
time
after
the
visitors
had
gone
before
harvey
came
home
they
sat
in
belle
bedroom
and
her
sentences
were
punctuated
by
little
backs
briskly
presented
to
have
small
garments
fastened
or
bows
put
on
stiffly
bobbed
yellow
hair
did
you
understand
my
letter
she
asked
i
was
sorry
i
had
sent
it
but
it
was
too
late
then
i
put
your
letter
and
theirs
together
i
supposed
that
harvey
he
was
about
out
of
his
mind
belle
said
in
her
worried
voice
stand
still
mary
ellen
he
went
to
gregory
and
i
suppose
he
said
a
good
bit
you
know
the
way
he
does
anyhow
she
was
very
angry
she
called
a
special
meeting
and
i
tried
to
prevent
their
recalling
you
he
does
know
that
of
course
you
tried
well
i
felt
as
though
it
was
your
work
belle
said
rather
uncomfortably
bring
me
the
comb
alice
i
guess
we
get
pretty
narrow
here
and
i
been
following
things
more
closely
since
you
went
over
i
know
more
than
i
did
and
of
course
after
one
marries
there
much
chance
there
are
children
and
her
face
twisted
i
wish
i
could
do
something
she
got
up
and
brought
from
the
dresser
a
newspaper
clipping
it
the
london
newspaper
she
explained
i
been
taking
it
but
harvey
does
know
he
does
care
much
for
the
english
this
is
about
your
being
decorated
sara
lee
held
it
listlessly
in
her
hands
shall
i
tell
him
belle
she
asked
belle
hesitated
i
do
believe
i
would
she
said
forlornly
he
wo
like
it
that
why
i
never
showed
him
that
clipping
he
hates
it
all
so
sara
lee
dressed
that
evening
in
the
white
frock
she
dressed
slowly
thinking
hard
all
round
her
was
the
shiny
newness
of
her
furniture
a
trifle
crowded
in
belle
small
room
sara
lee
had
a
terrible
feeling
of
being
fastened
in
by
it
wherever
she
turned
it
gleamed
she
felt
surrounded
smothered
she
had
meant
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
things
of
the
little
house
and
of
henri
and
of
the
king
pinning
the
medal
on
her
shabby
black
jacket
and
shaking
hands
with
her
henri
she
must
tell
about
not
his
name
of
course
nor
his
madness
nor
even
his
love
but
she
felt
that
she
owed
it
to
harvey
to
have
as
few
secrets
from
him
as
possible
she
would
tell
about
what
the
boy
had
done
for
her
and
how
he
and
he
alone
had
made
it
all
possible
surely
harvey
would
understand
it
was
a
page
that
was
closed
it
had
held
nothing
to
hurt
him
she
had
come
back
she
stood
by
her
window
thinking
and
a
breath
of
wind
set
the
leaves
outside
to
rustling
instantly
she
was
back
again
in
the
little
house
and
the
sound
was
not
leaves
but
the
shuffling
of
many
stealthy
feet
on
the
cobbles
of
the
street
at
night
that
shuffling
that
was
so
like
the
rustling
of
leaves
in
a
wood
or
the
murmur
of
water
running
over
a
stony
creek
bed
xxv
it
was
clear
to
sara
lee
from
the
beginning
of
the
evening
that
harvey
did
not
intend
to
hear
her
story
he
did
not
say
so
indeed
for
a
time
he
did
not
talk
at
all
he
sat
with
his
arms
round
her
content
just
to
have
her
there
i
have
a
lot
of
arrears
to
make
up
he
said
i
got
to
get
used
to
having
you
where
i
can
touch
you
when
i
go
upstairs
i
going
to
take
that
damned
colorless
photograph
of
you
and
throw
it
out
the
window
i
must
tell
you
about
your
photograph
she
ventured
it
always
stood
on
the
mantel
over
the
stove
and
when
there
was
a
threatened
bombardment
i
used
to
put
it
under
let
not
talk
honey
when
he
came
out
of
that
particular
silence
he
said
abruptly
will
leete
is
dead
oh
no
poor
will
leete
died
of
pneumonia
in
some
hole
over
there
he
left
a
wife
and
nothing
much
to
keep
her
that
what
comes
of
mixing
in
the
other
fellow
fight
i
guess
we
can
get
the
house
as
soon
as
we
want
it
she
has
to
sell
and
it
ought
to
be
a
bargain
harvey
she
said
rather
timidly
you
speak
of
the
other
fight
they
say
over
there
that
we
are
sure
to
be
drawn
into
it
sooner
or
later
not
on
our
life
he
replied
brusquely
and
if
you
do
mind
honey
i
do
care
to
hear
about
what
they
think
over
there
he
got
up
from
his
old
place
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
stood
on
the
rug
i
better
tell
you
now
how
i
feel
about
this
thing
i
ca
talk
about
it
all
we
finish
up
now
and
let
it
go
at
that
i
sorry
there
a
war
i
send
money
when
i
can
afford
it
to
help
the
belgians
though
my
personal
opinion
is
that
they
getting
theirs
for
what
they
did
in
the
congo
but
i
do
want
to
hear
about
what
you
did
over
there
he
saw
her
face
and
he
went
to
her
and
kissed
her
cheek
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
honey
he
said
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
but
somehow
i
ca
forget
that
you
left
me
and
went
over
there
when
there
was
no
reason
for
it
you
put
off
our
marriage
and
i
suppose
we
better
get
it
over
go
ahead
and
tell
me
about
it
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
waited
but
the
girl
smiled
rather
tremulously
perhaps
we
better
wait
if
you
feel
that
way
harvey
his
face
was
set
as
he
looked
at
her
there
only
one
thing
i
want
to
know
he
said
and
i
got
a
right
to
know
that
you
a
young
girl
and
you
beautiful
to
me
anyhow
you
been
over
there
with
a
lot
of
crazy
foreigners
he
got
up
again
and
all
the
bitterness
of
the
empty
months
was
in
his
voice
did
any
of
them
was
there
anybody
there
you
cared
about
i
came
back
harvey
that
not
the
question
there
were
many
men
officers
who
were
kind
to
me
i
that
not
the
question
either
if
i
had
loved
any
one
more
than
i
loved
you
i
should
not
have
come
back
wait
a
minute
he
said
quickly
you
had
to
come
back
you
know
i
could
have
stayed
the
englishwoman
who
took
over
my
work
asked
me
to
stay
on
and
help
her
he
was
satisfied
then
he
went
back
to
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
kissed
her
all
right
he
said
i
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
damned
but
that
fixes
it
now
let
talk
about
something
else
i
sick
of
this
war
talk
i
like
to
tell
you
about
my
little
house
and
poor
rené
who
was
rené
he
demanded
the
orderly
the
one
on
the
step
with
a
rifle
yes
look
here
he
said
i
got
to
get
to
all
that
gradually
i
know
that
i
ever
get
to
it
cheerfully
but
i
ca
talk
about
that
place
and
i
do
want
to
talk
war
the
whole
business
makes
me
sick
i
got
a
car
out
of
it
and
if
things
keep
on
we
may
be
able
to
get
the
leete
house
but
there
no
reason
in
it
no
sense
sick
to
death
of
hearing
about
it
let
talk
of
something
else
but
and
here
was
something
strange
sara
lee
could
find
nothing
else
to
talk
about
the
thing
that
she
had
looked
forward
so
eagerly
to
telling
that
was
barred
and
the
small
gossip
of
their
little
circle
purely
personal
and
trivial
held
only
faint
interest
for
her
for
the
first
time
they
had
no
common
ground
to
meet
on
yet
it
was
a
very
happy
man
who
went
whistling
to
his
room
that
night
he
was
rather
proud
of
himself
too
after
all
the
bitterness
of
the
past
months
he
had
been
gentle
and
loving
to
sara
lee
he
had
not
scolded
her
in
the
next
room
he
could
hear
her
going
quietly
about
opening
and
closing
the
drawers
of
the
new
bureau
moving
a
chair
pretty
soon
god
willing
they
need
never
be
separated
he
would
have
her
always
to
protect
and
cherish
and
love
he
went
outside
to
her
closed
door
good
night
sweetheart
he
called
softly
good
night
dear
came
her
soft
reply
but
long
after
he
was
asleep
sara
lee
stood
at
her
window
and
listened
to
the
leaves
so
like
the
feet
of
weary
men
on
the
ruined
street
over
there
for
the
first
time
she
was
questioning
the
thing
she
had
done
she
loved
harvey
but
there
were
many
kinds
of
love
there
was
the
love
of
jean
for
henri
and
there
was
the
wonderful
love
though
the
memory
now
was
cruel
and
hurt
her
of
henri
for
herself
and
there
was
the
love
of
marie
for
the
memory
of
maurice
the
spy
many
kinds
of
love
and
one
heart
might
love
many
people
in
different
ways
a
small
doubt
crept
into
her
mind
this
feeling
she
had
for
harvey
was
not
what
she
had
thought
it
was
over
there
it
was
a
thing
that
had
belonged
to
a
certain
phase
of
her
life
but
that
phase
was
over
it
was
like
marie
but
a
memory
this
harvey
of
the
new
car
and
the
increased
income
and
the
occasional
hardness
in
his
voice
was
not
the
harvey
she
had
left
or
perhaps
it
was
she
who
had
changed
she
wondered
she
felt
precisely
the
same
tender
toward
her
friends
unwilling
to
hurt
them
she
did
not
want
to
hurt
harvey
but
she
did
not
love
him
as
he
deserved
to
be
loved
and
she
had
a
momentary
lift
of
the
veil
when
she
saw
the
long
vista
of
the
years
the
two
of
them
always
together
and
always
between
them
hidden
untouched
but
eating
like
a
cancer
harvey
resentment
and
suspicion
of
her
months
away
from
him
there
would
always
be
a
barrier
between
them
not
only
on
harvey
side
there
were
things
she
had
no
right
to
tell
of
henri
of
his
love
and
care
for
her
and
of
that
last
terrible
day
when
he
realized
what
he
had
done
that
night
lying
in
the
new
bed
she
faced
that
situation
too
how
much
was
she
to
blame
if
henri
felt
that
each
life
lost
was
lost
by
him
was
the
same
true
for
her
why
had
she
allowed
him
to
stay
in
london
but
that
was
one
question
she
did
not
answer
frankly
she
lay
there
in
the
darkness
and
wondered
what
punishment
he
would
receive
he
had
done
so
much
for
them
over
there
surely
surely
they
would
allow
for
that
but
small
things
came
back
to
her
the
awful
sight
of
the
miller
and
his
son
led
away
to
death
with
the
sacks
over
their
heads
the
relentlessness
of
it
all
the
expecting
that
men
should
give
everything
even
life
itself
and
ask
for
no
mercy
and
this
too
she
remembered
once
in
a
wild
moment
henri
had
said
he
would
follow
her
to
america
and
that
there
he
would
prove
to
her
that
his
and
not
harvey
was
the
real
love
of
her
life
the
great
love
that
comes
but
once
to
any
woman
and
to
some
not
at
all
yet
on
that
last
night
at
morley
he
had
said
what
she
now
felt
was
a
final
farewell
that
last
look
of
his
from
the
doorway
that
had
been
the
look
of
a
man
who
would
fill
his
eyes
for
the
last
time
she
got
up
and
stood
by
the
window
what
had
they
done
to
him
what
would
they
do
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
four
in
the
morning
over
there
the
little
house
would
be
quiet
now
but
down
along
the
lines
men
would
be
standing
on
the
firing
step
of
the
trench
and
waiting
against
what
the
dawn
might
bring
through
the
thin
wall
came
the
sound
of
harvey
heavy
regular
breathing
she
remembered
henri
light
sleeping
on
the
kitchen
floor
his
cap
on
the
table
his
cape
rolled
round
him
a
sleeping
for
all
his
weariness
so
light
that
he
seemed
always
half
conscious
she
remembered
the
innumerable
times
he
had
come
in
at
this
hour
muddy
sometimes
rather
gray
of
face
with
fatigue
but
always
cheerful
it
was
just
such
an
hour
that
she
found
him
giving
hot
coffee
to
the
german
prisoner
it
had
been
but
a
little
earlier
when
he
had
taken
her
to
the
roof
and
had
there
shown
her
rené
lying
with
his
face
up
toward
the
sky
which
had
sent
him
death
a
hundred
memories
crowded
henri
love
for
the
belgian
soldiers
and
theirs
for
him
his
humor
his
absurd
riddles
there
was
the
one
he
had
asked
rené
the
very
day
before
the
air
attack
he
had
stood
stiffly
and
frowningly
before
the
boy
and
he
had
asked
in
a
highly
official
tone
what
must
a
man
be
to
be
buried
with
military
honors
a
general
no
an
officer
no
no
use
your
head
boy
this
is
very
important
a
mistake
would
be
most
serious
rené
had
shaken
his
head
dejectedly
he
must
be
dead
rené
henri
had
said
gravely
entirely
dead
as
i
said
it
is
well
to
know
these
things
a
mistake
would
be
unfortunate
his
blue
eyes
had
gleamed
with
fun
but
his
face
had
remained
frowning
it
was
quite
five
minutes
before
she
had
heard
rené
chuckling
on
the
doorstep
was
he
still
living
this
henri
of
the
love
of
life
and
courting
of
death
could
anything
so
living
die
and
if
he
had
died
had
it
been
because
of
her
she
faced
that
squarely
for
the
first
time
perhaps
even
beyond
the
stars
they
have
need
of
a
little
house
of
mercy
and
god
knows
wherever
i
am
i
shall
have
need
of
you
beyond
the
partition
harvey
slept
on
his
arms
under
his
head
xxvi
harvey
was
clamoring
for
an
early
wedding
and
indeed
there
were
few
arguments
against
it
save
one
that
sara
lee
buried
in
her
heart
belle
house
was
small
and
though
she
was
welcome
there
and
more
than
that
sara
lee
knew
that
she
was
crowding
the
family
perhaps
sara
lee
would
have
agreed
in
the
end
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
else
to
do
though
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
she
was
no
longer
in
any
doubt
as
to
what
her
feeling
for
harvey
really
was
it
was
kindness
affection
but
it
was
not
love
she
would
marry
him
because
she
had
promised
to
and
because
their
small
world
expected
her
to
do
so
and
because
she
could
not
shame
him
again
for
to
her
surprise
she
found
that
that
was
what
he
had
felt
a
strange
shame
like
that
of
a
man
who
has
been
jilted
she
felt
that
by
coming
back
to
him
she
had
forfeited
the
right
to
break
the
engagement
so
every
hour
of
every
day
seemed
to
make
the
thing
more
inevitable
belle
was
embroidering
towels
for
her
in
her
scant
leisure
even
anna
with
a
second
child
coming
sent
in
her
contribution
to
the
linen
chest
by
almost
desperately
insisting
on
a
visit
to
aunt
harriet
she
got
a
reprieve
of
a
month
and
harvey
was
inclined
to
be
jealous
even
of
that
sometimes
but
mostly
at
night
when
she
was
alone
a
hot
wave
of
resentment
overwhelmed
her
why
should
she
be
forced
into
the
thing
was
there
any
prospect
of
happiness
after
marriage
when
there
was
so
little
before
for
she
realized
now
that
even
harvey
was
not
happy
he
had
at
last
definitely
refused
to
hear
the
story
of
the
little
house
i
rather
just
forget
it
honey
he
said
but
inconsistently
he
knew
she
did
not
forget
it
and
it
angered
him
true
to
his
insistence
on
ignoring
those
months
of
her
absence
she
made
no
attempt
to
tell
him
now
and
then
however
closed
in
the
library
together
they
would
fail
of
things
to
talk
about
and
sara
knitting
needles
would
be
the
only
sound
in
the
room
at
those
times
he
would
sit
back
in
his
chair
and
watch
the
look
in
her
eyes
and
it
maddened
him
from
her
busy
life
belle
studied
them
both
with
an
understanding
she
did
not
reveal
and
one
morning
when
the
mail
came
she
saw
sara
face
as
she
turned
away
finding
there
was
no
letter
for
her
and
made
an
excuse
to
follow
her
to
her
room
the
girl
was
standing
by
the
window
looking
out
the
children
were
playing
below
and
the
maple
trees
were
silent
belle
joined
her
there
and
slipped
an
arm
round
her
why
are
you
doing
it
sara
lee
she
asked
doing
what
marrying
harvey
sara
lee
looked
at
her
with
startled
eyes
i
engaged
to
him
belle
i
promised
exactly
said
belle
dryly
but
that
hardly
a
good
reason
is
it
it
takes
more
than
a
promise
she
stared
down
at
the
flock
of
children
in
the
yard
below
harvey
a
man
she
said
he
does
understand
but
i
do
you
got
to
care
a
whole
lot
sara
lee
if
you
going
to
go
through
with
it
it
takes
a
lot
of
love
when
it
comes
to
having
children
and
all
that
he
so
good
belle
how
can
i
hurt
him
you
hurt
him
a
lot
more
by
marrying
him
when
you
do
love
him
if
only
i
could
have
a
little
time
she
cried
wildly
i
so
tired
belle
and
i
ca
forget
about
the
war
and
all
that
tried
sometimes
i
think
if
we
could
talk
it
over
together
i
get
it
out
of
my
mind
he
wo
talk
about
it
he
my
own
brother
and
i
love
him
dearly
but
sometimes
i
think
hard
not
that
he
ever
ugly
she
hastened
to
add
but
he
stubborn
there
a
sort
of
wall
in
him
and
he
puts
some
things
behind
it
and
it
like
beating
against
a
rock
to
try
to
get
at
them
after
a
little
silence
she
said
hesitatingly
we
got
him
to
think
of
too
he
has
a
right
to
be
happy
sometimes
i
looked
at
you
you
so
pretty
sara
lee
and
i
wondered
if
there
was
some
one
over
there
who
cared
for
you
there
was
one
man
an
officer
oh
belle
i
ca
tell
you
not
why
not
asked
belle
practically
you
ought
to
talk
it
out
to
some
one
and
if
harvey
insists
on
being
a
fool
that
his
own
fault
for
all
the
remainder
of
that
sunny
morning
sara
lee
talked
what
was
in
her
heart
and
belle
poor
romantic
starved
belle
heard
and
thrilled
she
made
buttonholes
as
she
listened
but
once
or
twice
a
new
tone
in
sara
lee
voice
caused
her
to
look
up
here
was
a
new
sara
lee
a
creature
of
vibrant
voice
and
glowing
eyes
and
belle
was
not
stupid
she
saw
that
it
was
henri
whose
name
brought
the
deeper
note
sara
lee
had
stopped
with
her
recall
had
stopped
and
looked
about
the
room
with
its
shiny
new
furniture
and
had
shivered
belle
bent
over
her
work
why
do
you
go
back
she
asked
sara
lee
looked
at
her
piteously
how
can
i
there
is
harvey
and
the
society
would
not
send
me
again
it
over
belle
all
over
after
a
pause
belle
said
what
become
of
henri
he
has
written
has
he
sara
lee
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
i
do
know
where
he
is
he
may
be
dead
her
voice
was
flat
and
lifeless
belle
knew
all
that
she
wanted
to
know
she
rose
and
gathered
up
her
sewing
i
going
to
talk
to
harvey
you
not
going
to
be
rushed
into
a
wedding
you
tired
and
it
all
nonsense
well
i
have
to
run
now
and
dress
the
children
that
night
harvey
and
belle
had
almost
a
violent
scene
he
had
taken
sara
lee
over
the
leete
house
that
evening
will
leete
widow
had
met
them
there
a
small
sad
figure
in
her
mourning
but
very
composed
until
she
opened
the
door
into
a
tiny
room
upstairs
with
a
desk
and
a
lamp
in
it
this
was
will
study
she
said
he
did
his
work
here
in
the
evenings
and
i
sat
in
that
little
chair
and
sewed
i
never
thought
then
her
lips
quivered
pretty
rotten
of
will
leete
to
leave
that
little
thing
alone
said
harvey
on
their
way
home
he
had
his
fling
and
she
paying
for
it
but
sara
lee
was
silent
it
was
useless
to
try
to
make
harvey
understand
the
urge
that
had
called
will
leete
across
the
sea
to
do
his
share
for
the
war
and
that
had
brought
him
that
peace
of
god
that
passeth
all
understanding
it
was
not
a
good
time
for
belle
to
put
up
to
him
her
suggestion
for
a
delay
in
the
marriage
that
evening
after
their
return
he
took
it
badly
and
insisted
on
sending
upstairs
for
sara
lee
did
you
ask
belle
to
do
this
he
demanded
bluntly
to
do
what
to
put
things
off
i
have
already
told
you
harvey
belle
put
in
it
is
my
own
idea
she
is
tired
she
been
through
a
lot
i
heard
the
story
too
stubborn
to
listen
to
and
i
strongly
advise
her
to
wait
a
while
and
after
a
time
he
agreed
ungraciously
he
would
buy
the
house
and
fix
it
over
and
in
the
early
fall
it
would
be
ready
unless
he
added
to
sara
lee
with
a
bitterness
born
of
disappointment
unless
you
change
your
mind
again
he
did
not
kiss
her
that
night
when
she
and
belle
went
together
up
the
stairs
but
he
stared
after
her
gloomily
with
hurt
and
bewilderment
in
his
eyes
he
did
not
understand
he
never
would
she
had
come
home
to
him
all
gentleness
and
tenderness
ready
to
find
in
him
the
things
she
needed
so
badly
but
out
of
his
obstinacy
and
hurt
he
had
himself
built
up
a
barrier
that
night
sara
lee
dreamed
that
she
was
back
in
the
little
house
of
mercy
rené
was
there
and
henri
and
jean
with
the
patch
over
his
eye
they
were
waiting
for
the
men
to
come
and
the
narrow
hall
was
full
of
the
odor
of
marie
soup
then
she
heard
them
coming
the
shuffling
of
many
feet
on
the
road
she
went
to
the
door
with
henri
beside
her
and
watched
them
coming
up
the
road
a
deeper
shadow
in
the
blackness
tired
men
wounded
men
homeless
men
coming
to
her
little
house
with
its
firelight
and
its
warmth
here
and
there
the
match
that
lighted
a
cigarette
showed
a
white
but
smiling
face
they
stopped
before
the
door
and
the
warm
little
house
with
its
guarded
lights
and
its
food
and
cheer
took
them
in
xxvii
very
pale
and
desperate
henri
took
the
night
a
train
for
folkestone
after
he
had
said
to
sara
lee
he
alternately
chilled
and
burned
with
fever
and
when
he
slept
as
he
did
now
and
then
going
off
suddenly
into
a
doze
and
waking
with
a
jerk
it
was
to
dream
of
horrors
he
thought
in
his
wilder
intervals
of
killing
himself
but
his
code
did
not
include
such
a
shirker
refuge
he
was
going
back
to
tell
his
story
and
to
take
his
punishment
he
had
cabled
to
jean
to
meet
him
at
calais
but
when
at
dawn
the
next
morning
the
channel
boat
drew
in
to
the
wharf
there
was
no
sign
of
jean
or
the
car
henri
regarded
the
empty
quay
with
apathetic
eyes
they
would
come
later
on
if
he
could
only
get
his
head
down
and
sleep
for
a
while
he
would
be
better
able
to
get
toward
the
front
for
he
knew
now
that
he
was
ill
he
had
indeed
been
ill
for
days
but
he
did
not
realize
that
and
he
hated
illness
he
regarded
it
with
suspicion
as
a
weakness
not
for
a
strong
man
the
drowsy
girl
in
her
chair
at
the
gare
maritime
regarded
him
curiously
and
with
interest
many
women
turned
to
look
after
henri
but
he
did
not
know
this
had
he
known
it
he
would
have
regarded
it
much
as
he
did
illness
the
stupid
boy
was
not
round
the
girl
herself
took
the
key
and
led
the
way
down
the
long
corridor
upstairs
to
a
room
henri
stumbled
in
and
fell
across
the
bed
he
was
almost
immediately
asleep
late
in
the
afternoon
he
wakened
strange
that
jean
had
not
come
he
got
up
and
bathed
his
face
his
right
arm
was
very
stiff
now
and
pains
ran
from
the
old
wound
in
his
chest
down
to
the
fingers
of
his
hand
he
tried
to
exercise
to
limber
it
and
grew
almost
weak
with
pain
at
six
when
jean
had
not
come
henri
resorted
to
ways
that
he
knew
of
and
secured
a
car
he
had
had
some
coffee
by
that
time
and
he
felt
much
better
so
well
indeed
that
he
sang
under
his
breath
a
strange
rambling
song
that
sounded
rather
like
rené
rendering
of
tipperary
the
driver
looked
at
him
curiously
every
now
and
then
it
was
ten
when
they
reached
la
panne
henri
went
at
once
to
the
villa
set
high
on
a
sand
dune
where
the
king
secretary
lived
the
house
was
dark
but
in
the
library
at
the
rear
there
was
a
light
he
stumbled
along
the
paths
beside
the
house
and
reached
at
last
after
interminable
miles
when
the
path
sometimes
came
up
almost
to
his
eyes
and
again
fell
away
so
that
it
seemed
to
drop
from
under
his
feet
at
last
he
reached
the
long
french
doors
with
their
drawn
curtains
he
opened
the
door
suddenly
and
thereby
surprised
the
secretary
who
was
a
most
dignified
and
rather
nervous
gentleman
into
laying
his
hand
on
a
heavy
inkwell
i
wish
to
see
the
king
said
henri
in
a
loud
tone
because
at
that
moment
the
secretary
lamp
and
inkwell
and
all
retired
suddenly
to
a
very
great
distance
as
if
one
had
viewed
them
through
the
reverse
end
of
an
opera
glass
the
secretary
knew
henri
he
too
eyed
him
curiously
the
king
has
retired
monsieur
i
think
said
henri
in
a
dangerous
tone
that
he
will
see
me
to
tell
the
truth
the
secretary
rather
thought
so
too
there
was
a
strange
rumor
going
round
to
the
effect
that
the
boy
had
followed
a
woman
to
england
at
a
critical
time
which
would
have
been
a
pity
the
secretary
thought
there
were
so
many
women
and
so
few
men
like
henri
the
secretary
considered
gravely
henri
was
by
that
time
in
a
chair
but
it
moved
about
so
that
he
had
to
hold
very
tight
to
the
arms
when
he
looked
up
again
the
secretary
had
picked
up
his
soft
black
hat
and
was
at
the
door
i
shall
inquire
he
said
henri
saluted
him
stiffly
with
his
left
hand
as
he
went
out
the
secretary
went
to
his
majesty
equerry
who
was
in
the
next
house
playing
solitaire
and
trying
to
forget
the
family
he
had
left
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
so
it
was
that
in
due
time
henri
again
traversed
miles
of
path
and
pavement
between
tall
borders
of
wild
sea
grass
miles
which
perhaps
were
a
hundred
yards
and
went
round
the
screen
and
found
the
king
on
the
hearthrug
but
when
he
drew
himself
stiffly
to
attention
he
overdid
the
thing
rather
and
went
over
backward
with
a
crash
he
was
up
again
almost
immediately
very
flushed
and
uncomfortable
after
that
he
kept
himself
in
hand
but
the
king
who
had
a
way
all
his
own
of
forgetting
his
divine
right
to
rule
and
a
great
many
other
things
the
king
watched
him
gravely
henri
sat
in
a
chair
and
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
because
he
was
feeling
rather
strange
he
told
a
great
many
things
that
an
agent
of
the
secret
service
is
hardly
expected
to
reveal
to
his
king
he
mentioned
for
instance
the
color
of
sara
lee
eyes
and
the
way
she
bandaged
like
one
who
had
been
trained
once
in
the
very
middle
of
his
narrative
where
he
had
put
the
letter
from
the
front
in
his
pocket
and
decided
to
go
to
england
anyhow
he
stopped
and
hummed
rené
version
of
tipperary
only
a
bar
or
two
then
he
remembered
but
one
thing
brought
him
round
with
a
start
then
said
the
king
slowly
jean
was
not
with
you
only
he
did
not
call
him
jean
he
gave
him
his
other
name
which
like
henri
is
not
to
be
told
henri
brain
cleared
then
with
the
news
that
jean
was
missing
when
somewhat
later
he
staggered
out
of
the
villa
it
was
under
royal
instructions
to
report
to
the
great
hospital
along
the
sea
front
and
near
by
and
there
to
go
to
bed
and
have
a
doctor
indeed
because
the
boy
eyes
were
wild
by
that
time
the
equerry
went
along
and
held
his
arm
but
that
was
because
henri
was
in
open
revolt
and
while
walking
steadily
enough
showed
a
tendency
to
bolt
every
now
and
then
he
would
stop
on
the
way
and
argue
though
one
does
not
argue
easily
with
an
equerry
i
must
go
he
would
say
fretfully
god
knows
where
he
is
never
give
me
up
if
i
were
the
one
and
once
he
shook
off
the
equerry
violently
and
said
let
go
of
me
i
tell
you
i
come
back
and
go
to
bed
when
found
him
the
equerry
soothed
him
like
a
child
an
english
nurse
took
charge
of
henri
in
the
hospital
and
put
him
to
bed
he
was
very
polite
to
her
and
extremely
cynical
she
sat
in
a
chair
by
his
bed
and
held
the
key
of
the
room
in
her
hand
once
he
thought
she
was
sara
lee
but
that
was
only
for
a
moment
she
did
not
look
like
sara
lee
and
she
was
suspicious
too
for
when
he
asked
her
what
she
could
put
in
her
left
hand
that
she
could
not
put
in
her
right
she
moved
away
and
placed
the
door
key
on
the
stand
out
of
reach
however
toward
morning
she
dozed
there
was
steady
firing
at
nieuport
and
the
windows
shook
constantly
an
ambulance
came
in
followed
by
a
stirring
on
the
lower
floor
then
silence
he
got
up
then
and
secured
the
key
there
was
no
time
for
dressing
because
she
was
a
suspicious
person
and
likely
to
waken
at
any
time
he
rolled
his
clothing
into
a
bundle
and
carried
it
under
his
well
arm
the
other
was
almost
useless
the
ambulance
was
still
waiting
outside
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
there
were
voices
and
lights
in
the
operating
room
forward
along
the
tiled
hall
still
in
his
night
clothing
henri
got
into
the
ambulance
and
threw
his
uniform
behind
him
then
he
got
the
car
under
way
outside
the
village
he
paused
long
enough
to
dress
his
head
was
amazingly
clear
he
had
never
felt
so
sure
of
himself
before
as
to
his
errand
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
jean
had
learned
that
he
had
crossed
the
channel
therefore
jean
had
taken
up
his
work
jean
who
had
but
one
eye
and
was
as
clumsy
as
a
bear
the
thought
of
jean
crawling
through
the
german
trenches
set
him
laughing
until
he
ended
with
a
sob
it
was
rather
odd
about
the
ambulance
it
did
not
keep
the
road
very
well
sometimes
it
was
on
one
side
and
sometimes
on
the
other
it
slid
as
though
the
road
were
greased
and
after
a
time
henri
made
an
amazing
discovery
he
was
not
alone
in
the
car
he
looked
back
without
stopping
and
the
machine
went
off
in
a
wide
arc
he
brought
it
back
again
grinning
thought
you
had
me
did
you
he
observed
to
the
car
in
general
and
the
engine
in
particular
now
no
tricks
there
was
a
wounded
man
in
the
car
he
had
had
morphia
and
he
was
very
comfortable
he
was
not
badly
hurt
and
he
considered
that
he
was
being
taken
to
calais
he
was
too
tired
to
talk
and
the
swinging
of
the
car
rather
interested
him
he
would
doze
and
waken
and
doze
again
but
at
last
he
heard
something
that
made
him
rise
on
his
elbow
it
was
the
hammering
of
the
big
guns
he
called
henri
attention
to
this
but
henri
said
lie
down
jean
and
do
talk
we
make
it
yet
the
wounded
man
intended
to
make
a
protest
but
he
went
to
sleep
instead
they
had
reached
the
village
now
where
was
the
little
house
of
mercy
the
ambulance
rolled
and
leaped
down
the
street
with
both
lights
full
on
which
was
forbidden
and
came
to
a
stop
at
the
door
the
man
inside
was
grunting
then
and
henri
whose
head
had
never
been
so
clear
got
out
and
went
round
to
the
rear
of
the
car
now
out
with
you
comrade
he
said
i
have
made
an
error
but
it
is
immaterial
can
you
walk
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
the
man
inside
saw
his
burning
eyes
and
shaking
hands
even
through
the
apathy
of
the
morphia
he
felt
a
thrill
of
terror
he
could
walk
he
got
out
while
henri
pounded
at
the
door
he
called
then
he
hummed
an
air
of
the
camps
trou
là
là
ça
ne
va
guère
trou
là
là
ça
ne
va
pas
when
he
heard
steps
inside
henri
went
back
to
the
ambulance
he
got
in
and
drove
it
lights
and
all
down
the
street
trou
là
là
ça
ne
va
guère
trou
là
là
ça
ne

somewhere
down
the
road
beyond
the
poplar
trees
he
abandoned
the
ambulance
they
found
it
there
the
next
morning
or
rather
what
was
left
of
it
evidently
its
two
unwinking
eyes
had
got
on
the
germans
nerves
early
the
next
morning
a
saxon
regiment
standing
on
the
firing
step
ready
for
what
the
dawn
might
bring
forth
watched
the
mist
rise
from
the
water
in
front
of
them
it
shone
on
a
body
in
a
belgian
uniform
lying
across
their
wire
and
very
close
indeed
now
the
saxons
are
not
prussians
so
no
one
for
sport
fired
at
the
body
which
was
rather
a
good
thing
because
it
moved
slightly
and
stirred
and
then
in
a
loud
voice
which
is
an
unusual
thing
for
bodies
to
possess
it
began
to
sing

xxviii
late
in
august
sara
lee
broke
her
engagement
with
harvey
she
had
been
away
at
cousin
jennie
for
a
month
and
for
the
first
time
since
her
return
she
had
had
time
to
think
in
the
little
suburban
town
there
were
long
hours
of
quiet
when
cousin
jennie
mended
on
the
porch
and
aunt
harriet
enjoying
a
sort
of
reflected
glory
from
sara
lee
presided
at
red
cross
meetings
sara
lee
decided
to
send
for
harvey
and
he
came
for
a
arriving
pathetically
eager
but
with
a
sort
of
defiance
too
he
was
determined
to
hold
her
but
to
hold
her
on
his
own
terms
aunt
harriet
had
been
vaguely
uneasy
but
harvey
arrival
seemed
to
put
everything
right
she
even
kissed
him
when
he
came
and
took
great
pains
to
carry
off
cousin
jennie
when
she
showed
an
inclination
toward
conversation
and
a
seat
on
the
porch
sara
lee
had
made
a
desperate
resolve
she
intended
to
lay
all
her
cards
on
the
table
he
should
know
all
that
there
was
to
know
if
after
that
he
still
wanted
to
hold
her
but
she
did
not
go
so
far
she
was
so
sure
he
would
release
her
it
was
a
despairing
thing
to
do
but
she
was
rather
despairing
those
days
there
had
been
no
letter
from
henri
or
from
jean
she
had
written
them
both
several
times
to
dunkirk
to
the
savoy
in
london
to
the
little
house
near
the
front
but
no
replies
had
come
yet
mail
was
going
through
mabel
andrews
letters
from
boulogne
came
regularly
when
august
went
by
with
no
letters
save
harvey
begging
her
to
come
back
she
gave
up
at
last
in
the
little
church
on
sundays
with
jennie
on
one
side
and
aunt
harriet
on
the
other
she
voiced
small
silent
prayers
that
the
thing
she
feared
had
not
happened
but
she
could
not
think
of
henri
as
not
living
he
was
too
strong
too
vital
she
did
not
understand
herself
those
days
she
was
desperately
unhappy
sometimes
she
wondered
if
it
would
not
be
easier
to
know
the
truth
even
if
that
truth
comprehended
the
worst
once
she
received
from
some
unknown
hand
a
french
journal
and
pored
over
it
for
days
with
her
french
dictionary
to
find
if
it
contained
any
news
it
was
not
until
a
week
later
that
she
received
a
letter
from
mabel
explaining
that
she
had
sent
the
journal
which
contained
a
description
of
her
hospital
all
of
harvey
sunday
she
spent
in
trying
to
bring
her
courage
to
the
point
of
breaking
the
silence
he
had
imposed
on
her
but
it
was
not
until
evening
that
she
succeeded
the
house
was
empty
the
family
had
gone
to
church
on
the
veranda
with
the
heavy
scent
of
phlox
at
night
permeating
the
still
air
sara
lee
made
her
confession
she
began
at
the
beginning
harvey
did
not
stir
until
she
told
of
the
way
she
had
stowed
away
to
cross
the
channel
then
he
moved
this
fellow
who
planned
that
for
you
did
you
ever
see
him
again
he
met
me
in
calais
and
then
what
he
took
me
to
dunkirk
in
his
car
such
a
hideous
car
harvey
all
wrecked
it
had
been
under
fire
again
and
again
i
he
took
you
to
dunkirk
who
was
with
you
just
jean
the
chauffeur
i
like
his
nerve
was
there
in
all
that
godforsaken
country
a
woman
to
take
with
you
you
and
this
what
was
his
name
anyhow
i
ca
tell
you
that
harvey
look
here
he
burst
out
how
much
of
this
are
you
going
to
tell
because
i
want
it
all
or
not
at
all
i
ca
tell
you
his
name
i
only
trying
to
make
you
understand
the
way
i
feel
about
things
his
name
does
matter
she
clenched
her
hands
in
the
darkness
i
do
think
he
is
alive
now
he
tried
to
see
her
face
but
she
turned
it
away
dead
eh
what
makes
you
think
that
i
have
heard
from
him
why
should
you
hear
from
him
his
voice
cut
like
a
knife
look
at
me
why
should
he
write
to
you
he
cared
for
me
harvey
he
sat
in
a
heavy
silence
which
alarmed
her
do
be
angry
please
she
begged
i
could
bear
it
it
was
my
fault
or
his
either
the
damned
scoundrel
said
harvey
thickly
but
she
reached
over
and
put
a
trembling
hand
over
his
lips
do
say
that
she
said
do
i
wo
allow
you
to
when
i
think
what
may
have
happened
to
him
i
her
voice
broke
go
on
harvey
said
in
cold
tones
she
had
never
heard
before
tell
it
all
now
you
begun
it
god
knows
i
did
want
to
hear
it
he
took
you
to
the
hotel
at
dunkirk
the
way
those
foreigners
take
their
women
and
he
established
you
in
the
house
at
the
front
i
suppose
like
a
sara
lee
suddenly
stood
up
and
drew
off
her
ring
you
need
go
on
she
said
quietly
i
had
a
decision
to
make
and
i
have
made
it
ever
since
i
came
home
i
have
been
trying
to
go
back
to
where
we
were
before
i
left
it
is
possible
you
are
what
you
always
were
harvey
but
i
changed
i
ca
go
back
she
put
the
ring
into
his
hand
it
is
that
you
do
love
me
i
think
you
do
but
i
been
thinking
things
over
it
is
only
or
what
you
just
said
it
because
we
do
care
for
the
same
things
or
believe
in
them
but
if
we
love
each
other
it
not
that
either
i
used
to
feel
that
way
a
home
and
some
one
to
care
about
and
a
little
pleasure
and
work
that
ought
to
be
enough
honey
he
was
terrified
his
anger
was
gone
he
placed
an
appealing
hand
on
her
arm
and
as
she
stood
there
in
the
faint
starlight
the
wonder
of
her
once
again
got
him
by
the
throat
she
had
that
sort
of
repressed
eagerness
that
look
of
being
poised
for
flight
that
had
always
made
him
feel
cheap
and
unworthy
is
that
enough
honey
he
repeated
not
now
she
said
her
eyes
turned
toward
the
east
these
are
great
days
harvey
they
are
greater
and
more
terrible
than
any
one
can
know
who
has
not
been
there
i
been
there
and
i
know
i
have
the
right
to
all
this
peace
and
comfort
when
i
know
how
things
are
going
over
there
down
the
quiet
street
of
the
little
town
service
was
over
the
last
hymn
had
been
sung
through
the
open
windows
came
the
mellow
sound
of
the
minister
voice
in
benediction
too
far
away
to
be
more
than
a
tone
like
a
single
deep
note
of
the
organ
sara
lee
listened
she
knew
the
words
he
was
saying
and
she
listened
with
her
eyes
turned
to
the
east
the
peace
of
god
that
passeth
all
understanding
be
and
abide
with
you
all
forevermore
amen
sara
lee
listened
and
from
the
step
below
her
harvey
watched
her
with
furtive
haggard
eyes
he
had
not
heard
the
benediction
the
peace
of
god
she
said
slowly
there
is
only
one
peace
of
god
harvey
and
that
is
service
i
am
going
back
service
he
scoffed
you
are
going
back
to
him
i
afraid
he
is
not
there
any
more
i
am
going
back
to
work
but
if
he
is
there
harvey
slid
the
ring
into
his
pocket
what
if
he
not
there
he
demanded
bitterly
if
you
think
after
all
this
that
i
going
to
wait
on
the
chance
of
your
coming
back
to
me
you
mistaken
been
a
laughing
stock
long
enough
in
the
light
of
her
new
decision
sara
lee
viewed
him
for
the
first
time
with
the
pitiless
eyes
of
women
who
have
lost
a
faith
she
saw
him
for
what
he
was
not
deliberately
cruel
not
even
unkindly
but
selfish
small
without
vision
harvey
was
for
his
own
fireside
his
office
his
little
family
group
his
labor
would
always
be
for
himself
and
his
own
whereas
sara
lee
was
now
and
forever
for
all
the
world
her
hands
consecrated
to
bind
up
its
little
wounds
and
to
soothe
its
great
ones
harvey
craved
a
cheap
and
easy
peace
she
wanted
no
peace
except
that
bought
by
service
the
peace
of
a
tired
body
the
peace
of
the
little
house
in
belgium
where
after
days
of
torture
weary
men
found
quiet
and
ease
and
the
cheer
of
the
open
door
xxix
late
in
october
sara
lee
went
back
to
the
little
house
of
mercy
went
unaccredited
and
with
her
own
money
she
had
sold
her
bit
of
property
in
london
she
went
to
the
traverses
as
before
but
with
a
difference
too
for
sara
lee
had
learned
the
strangeness
of
the
english
who
are
slow
to
friendships
but
who
never
forget
indeed
a
telegram
met
her
at
liverpool
asking
her
to
stop
with
them
in
london
she
replied
refusing
but
thanking
them
and
saying
she
would
call
the
next
afternoon
everything
was
the
same
at
morley
rather
a
larger
percentage
of
men
in
uniform
perhaps
greater
crowds
in
the
square
a
little
less
of
the
optimism
which
in
the
spring
had
predicted
victory
before
autumn
but
the
same
high
courage
for
all
that
august
greeted
her
like
an
old
friend
even
the
waiters
bowed
to
her
and
upstairs
the
elderly
chambermaid
fussed
over
her
like
a
mother
and
you
going
back
she
exclaimed
fancy
that
now
you
are
brave
miss
but
her
keen
eyes
saw
a
change
in
sara
lee
her
smile
was
the
same
but
there
were
times
when
she
forgot
to
finish
a
sentence
and
she
stood
that
first
morning
for
an
hour
by
the
window
looking
out
as
if
she
saw
nothing
she
went
before
the
visit
to
the
traverses
to
the
church
of
saint
martin
in
the
fields
it
was
empty
save
for
a
woman
in
a
corner
who
did
not
kneel
but
sat
staring
quietly
before
her
sara
lee
prayed
an
inarticulate
bit
of
a
prayer
that
what
the
traverses
would
have
to
tell
her
should
not
be
the
thing
that
she
feared
but
that
if
it
were
she
be
given
courage
to
meet
it
and
to
go
on
with
her
work
the
traverses
would
know
cameron
was
a
friend
they
would
know
about
henri
and
about
jean
soon
within
the
hour
she
would
learn
everything
so
she
asked
for
strength
and
then
sat
there
for
a
time
letting
the
peace
of
the
old
church
quiet
her
as
had
the
broken
walls
and
shattered
altar
of
that
other
church
across
the
channel
it
was
rather
a
surprise
to
sara
lee
to
have
travers
put
her
arms
about
her
and
kiss
her
travers
too
patted
her
hand
when
he
took
it
but
they
had
for
all
that
the
reserve
of
their
class
much
that
they
felt
about
sara
lee
they
did
not
express
even
to
each
other
we
are
so
grateful
to
you
travers
said
i
am
only
one
mother
and
of
course
now
she
looked
down
at
her
black
dress
but
how
many
others
there
are
who
will
want
to
thank
you
when
this
terrible
thing
is
over
and
they
learn
about
you
travers
had
been
eying
sara
lee
did
use
you
up
did
it
he
asked
you
not
looking
quite
fit
sara
lee
was
very
pale
just
then
in
a
moment
she
would
know
i
quite
well
she
said
i
do
you
hear
from
mrs
cameron
frequently
she
has
worked
hard
but
she
is
not
young
it
was
travers
who
spoke
she
afraid
of
the
winter
there
i
rather
think
since
you
want
to
go
back
that
she
will
be
glad
to
turn
your
domain
over
to
you
for
a
time
then
the
little
house
is
still
there
indeed
yes
a
very
famous
little
house
indeed
but
it
is
always
known
as
your
house
she
has
felt
like
a
temporary
chatelaine
she
always
thought
you
would
come
back
tea
had
come
as
before
the
momentary
stir
gave
her
a
chance
to
brace
herself
travers
brought
her
cup
to
her
and
smiled
gently
down
at
her
we
have
a
plan
to
talk
over
he
said
when
you
have
had
your
tea
i
hope
you
will
agree
to
it
he
went
back
to
the
hearthrug
when
i
was
there
before
sara
lee
said
trying
to
hold
her
cup
steady
there
was
a
young
belgian
officer
who
was
very
kind
to
me
indeed
all
the
credit
for
what
i
did
belongs
to
him
and
since
i
went
home
i
have
heard
her
voice
broke
suddenly
travers
glanced
at
his
wife
not
for
nothing
had
cameron
written
her
long
letters
to
these
old
friends
in
the
quiet
summer
afternoons
when
the
sun
shone
down
on
the
lifeless
street
before
the
little
house
i
afraid
we
have
bad
news
for
you
travers
put
down
her
untasted
tea
or
rather
we
have
no
news
of
course
she
added
seeing
sara
lee
eyes
in
this
war
no
news
may
be
the
best
that
is
he
may
be
a
prisoner
that
sara
lee
heard
herself
say
is
impossible
if
they
captured
him
they
would
shoot
him
travers
nodded
silently
they
knew
henri
business
too
by
that
time
and
that
there
was
no
hope
for
a
captured
spy
and
jean
they
did
not
know
of
jean
so
she
told
them
still
in
that
voice
and
at
last
travers
brought
an
early
letter
of
cameron
and
read
a
part
of
it
aloud
he
seems
to
have
been
delirious
she
read
holding
her
reading
glasses
to
her
eyes
a
friend
of
his
very
devoted
to
him
was
missing
and
he
learned
this
somehow
he
escaped
from
the
hospital
and
got
away
in
an
ambulance
he
came
straight
here
and
wakened
us
there
had
been
a
wounded
man
in
the
machine
and
he
left
him
on
our
doorstep
when
i
got
to
the
door
the
car
was
going
wildly
toward
the
front
with
both
lamps
lighted
we
did
not
understand
then
of
course
and
no
one
thought
of
following
it
the
ambulance
was
found
smashed
by
a
shell
the
next
morning
and
at
first
we
thought
that
he
had
been
in
it
but
there
was
no
sign
that
he
had
been
and
that
night
one
of
the
men
from
the
trenches
insisted
that
he
had
climbed
out
of
a
firing
trench
where
the
soldier
stood
and
had
gone
forward
bareheaded
toward
the
german
lines
i
am
afraid
it
was
the
end
the
men
however
who
all
loved
him
do
not
think
so
it
seems
that
he
has
done
miracles
again
and
again
i
understand
that
along
the
whole
belgian
line
they
watch
for
him
at
night
the
other
night
a
german
on
reconnoissance
got
very
close
to
our
wire
and
was
greeted
not
by
shots
but
by
a
wild
hurrah
he
was
almost
paralyzed
with
surprise
they
brought
him
here
on
the
way
back
to
the
prison
camp
and
he
still
looked
dazed
sara
lee
sat
with
her
hands
clenched
travers
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
back
into
its
envelope
how
long
ago
was
that
sara
lee
asked
in
a
low
tone
because
if
he
was
coming
back
at
all
four
months
suddenly
sara
lee
stood
up
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
said
with
a
face
that
i
am
responsible
he
cared
for
me
and
i
was
in
love
with
him
too
only
i
did
know
it
then
i
let
him
bring
me
to
england
because
i
suppose
it
was
because
i
loved
him
i
did
think
then
that
it
was
that
i
was
engaged
to
a
man
at
home
sit
down
said
travers
my
dear
child
nothing
can
be
your
fault
he
came
with
me
and
the
germans
got
through
he
had
had
word
but
have
you
your
salts
travers
asked
quietly
of
his
wife
i
not
fainting
i
only
utterly
wretched
the
traverses
looked
at
each
other
they
were
english
they
had
taken
their
own
great
loss
quietly
because
it
was
an
individual
grief
and
must
not
be
intruded
on
the
sorrow
of
a
nation
but
they
found
this
girl
infinitely
appealing
a
small
and
fragile
figure
to
whose
grief
must
be
added
without
any
fault
of
hers
a
bitter
and
lasting
remorse
sara
lee
stood
up
and
tried
to
smile
please
do
worry
about
me
she
said
i
need
something
to
do
all
you
see
i
been
worrying
for
so
long
if
i
can
get
to
work
and
try
to
make
up
i
not
be
so
hopeless
but
i
am
not
quite
hopeless
either
she
added
hastily
it
was
as
though
by
the
very
word
she
had
consigned
henri
to
death
you
see
i
am
like
the
men
i
wo
give
him
up
and
perhaps
some
night
he
will
come
across
from
the
other
side
out
of
the
dark
travers
took
her
back
to
the
hotel
when
he
returned
from
paying
off
the
taxi
he
found
her
looking
across
at
the
square
do
you
remember
she
asked
him
the
time
when
the
little
donkey
was
hurt
over
there
i
shall
never
forget
it
and
the
young
officer
who
ran
out
when
i
did
and
shot
the
poor
thing
travers
remembered
that
was
he
the
man
we
have
been
speaking
of
for
the
first
time
that
day
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
sara
lee
at
twenty
was
already
living
in
her
memories
so
again
the
lights
went
down
in
front
and
the
back
drop
became
but
a
veil
and
invisible
and
to
sara
lee
there
came
back
again
some
of
the
characters
of
the
early
en
marching
men
forage
wagons
squadrons
of
french
cavalry
escorting
various
staffs
commandeered
farm
horses
with
shaggy
fetlocks
fastened
in
rope
corrals
artillery
rumbling
along
rutted
roads
which
shook
the
gunners
almost
off
the
limbers
nothing
was
changed
and
everything
there
was
no
rené
to
smile
his
adoring
smile
but
marie
came
out
sobbing
and
laughing
and
threw
herself
into
the
girl
arms
the
little
house
was
the
same
save
for
a
hole
in
the
kitchen
wall
there
were
the
great
piles
of
white
bowls
and
the
shining
kettles
there
was
the
corner
of
her
room
patched
by
rené
hands
now
so
long
quiet
a
few
more
shell
holes
in
the
street
many
more
little
crosses
in
the
field
near
the
poplar
trees
more
allied
aëroplanes
in
the
air
that
was
all
that
was
changed
but
to
sara
lee
everything
was
changed
for
all
that
the
little
house
was
grave
and
still
like
a
house
of
the
dead
once
it
had
echoed
to
young
laughter
had
resounded
to
the
noise
and
excitement
of
every
entrance
even
when
he
was
not
there
it
was
as
though
it
but
waited
for
him
to
stir
it
into
life
and
small
echoes
of
his
gayety
had
seemed
to
cling
to
its
old
walls
sara
lee
stood
on
the
doorstep
and
looked
within
she
had
come
back
here
she
would
work
and
wait
and
if
in
the
goodness
of
providence
he
should
come
back
here
he
would
find
her
all
the
empty
months
gone
and
forgotten
if
he
did
not
i
shall
still
be
calling
you
and
waiting
he
had
written
she
too
would
call
and
wait
and
if
not
here
then
surely
in
the
fullness
of
time
which
is
eternity
the
call
would
be
answered
in
october
sara
lee
took
charge
again
of
the
little
house
cameron
went
back
to
england
but
not
until
the
traverses
plan
had
been
revealed
they
would
support
the
little
house
as
a
memorial
to
the
son
who
had
died
it
was
travers
wrote
the
finest
tribute
they
could
offer
to
his
memory
that
night
after
night
tired
and
ill
and
wounded
men
might
find
sanctuary
even
for
a
little
time
under
her
care
luxuries
began
to
come
across
the
channel
food
and
dressings
and
tobacco
knitted
things
too
for
another
winter
was
coming
and
already
the
frost
lay
white
on
the
fields
in
the
mornings
the
little
house
took
on
a
new
air
of
prosperity
there
were
days
when
it
seemed
almost
swaggering
with
opulence
it
had
need
of
everything
however
with
the
prospect
of
a
second
winter
when
an
advance
was
impossible
the
germans
took
to
hammering
again
bombardment
was
incessant
the
little
village
was
again
under
suspicion
and
there
came
days
of
terror
when
it
seemed
as
though
even
the
fallen
masonry
must
be
reduced
to
powder
the
church
went
entirely
by
december
sara
lee
had
ceased
to
take
refuge
during
the
bombardments
the
fatalism
of
the
front
had
got
her
she
would
die
or
live
according
to
the
great
plan
and
nothing
could
change
that
she
did
not
greatly
care
which
except
for
her
work
and
even
that
she
felt
could
be
carried
on
by
another
as
well
there
was
no
news
of
henri
but
once
the
king
equerry
going
by
had
stopped
to
see
her
and
had
told
her
the
story
he
was
ill
undoubtedly
he
said
even
when
he
went
to
london
he
was
ill
and
not
responsible
the
king
understands
that
he
was
a
brave
boy
mademoiselle
but
the
last
element
of
hope
seemed
to
go
with
that
verification
of
his
illness
he
was
delirious
and
he
had
gone
in
that
condition
into
the
filthy
chill
waters
of
the
inundation
well
and
sane
there
had
been
a
chance
but
plunging
and
reckless
into
that
hell
across
there
was
none
she
did
her
best
in
the
evenings
to
be
cheerful
to
take
the
place
in
her
small
and
serious
fashion
of
henri
old
gayety
but
the
soldiers
whispered
among
themselves
that
mademoiselle
was
in
grief
as
they
were
for
the
blithe
young
soldier
who
was
gone
what
hope
sara
lee
had
had
died
almost
entirely
early
in
december
on
the
evening
of
a
day
when
a
steady
rain
had
turned
the
roads
into
slimy
pitfalls
and
the
ditches
to
canals
there
came
brought
by
a
belgian
corporal
the
man
who
swore
that
henri
had
passed
him
in
his
trench
while
the
others
slept
had
shoved
him
aside
which
was
unlike
his
usual
courtesy
and
had
climbed
out
over
the
top
to
sara
lee
this
hutin
told
his
story
a
short
man
with
a
red
beard
and
a
kindly
smile
that
revealed
teeth
almost
destroyed
from
neglect
he
was
at
first
diffident
in
the
extreme
it
was
the
captain
mademoiselle
he
asserted
i
know
him
well
he
has
often
gone
on
his
errands
from
near
my
post
i
am
he
smiled
i
am
usually
in
the
front
line
what
did
he
do
he
had
no
cap
mademoiselle
i
thought
that
was
odd
and
as
you
know
he
does
not
wear
his
own
uniform
on
such
occasions
but
he
wore
his
own
uniform
so
that
at
first
i
did
not
know
what
he
intended
later
on
she
asked
you
did
you
hear
anything
the
usual
sniping
mademoiselle
nothing
more
he
went
through
the
inundation
how
else
could
he
go
through
the
wire
first
at
the
barrier
where
there
is
an
opening
if
one
knows
the
way
i
saw
him
beyond
it
by
the
light
of
a
fusee
there
is
a
road
there
or
what
was
once
a
road
he
stood
there
then
the
lights
went
out
xxx
on
a
wild
night
in
january
sara
lee
inaugurated
a
new
branch
of
service
there
had
been
a
delay
in
sending
up
to
the
front
the
men
who
had
been
on
rest
and
an
incessant
bombardment
held
the
troops
prisoners
in
their
trenches
a
field
kitchen
had
been
destroyed
the
men
were
hungry
disheartened
wet
through
they
needed
her
she
felt
even
the
little
she
could
do
would
help
all
day
she
had
made
soup
and
at
evening
marie
led
from
its
dilapidated
stable
the
little
horse
that
henri
had
once
brought
up
trundling
its
cart
behind
it
the
boiler
of
the
cart
was
scoured
a
fire
lighted
in
the
fire
box
marie
a
country
girl
harnessed
the
shaggy
little
animal
but
with
tears
of
terror
you
will
be
killed
mademoiselle
she
protested
weeping
but
i
have
gone
before
do
you
remember
the
man
whose
wife
was
english
and
how
i
wrote
a
letter
for
him
before
he
died
what
will
become
of
the
house
if
you
are
killed
dear
marie
said
sara
lee
that
is
all
arranged
for
you
will
send
to
poperinghe
for
your
aunt
and
she
will
come
until
cameron
or
some
one
else
can
come
from
england
and
you
will
stay
on
will
you
promise
that
marie
promised
in
a
loud
wail
of
course
i
shall
come
back
sara
lee
said
stirring
her
soup
preparatory
to
pouring
it
out
i
shall
be
very
careful
you
will
not
come
back
mademoiselle
you
do
not
care
to
live
and
to
such
those
are
the
ones
who
live
on
said
sara
lee
gravely
and
poured
out
her
soup
she
went
quite
alone
there
was
a
great
deal
of
noise
but
no
shells
fell
near
her
she
led
the
little
horse
by
its
head
and
its
presence
gave
her
comfort
it
had
a
sense
that
she
had
not
too
for
it
kept
her
on
the
road
in
those
still
early
days
the
belgian
trenches
were
quite
accessible
from
the
rear
there
were
no
long
tunneled
ways
to
traverse
to
reach
them
one
went
along
through
the
darkness
until
the
sound
of
voices
the
glare
of
charcoal
in
a
bucket
bored
with
holes
the
flicker
of
a
match
told
of
the
buried
army
almost
underfoot
or
huddled
in
its
flimsy
shelters
behind
the
railway
embankment
beyond
the
lines
a
sentry
stopped
her
hailing
her
sharply
it
is
i
she
called
through
the
rain
i
have
brought
some
chocolate
and
some
soup
he
lowered
his
bayonet
pass
mademoiselle
she
went
on
the
rumbling
of
her
little
cart
deadened
by
the
belgian
guns
through
the
trenches
that
night
went
the
word
that
near
the
repose
of
the
angels
which
was
but
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
scarcely
reposeful
there
was
to
be
had
hot
soup
and
chocolate
and
cigarettes
a
dozen
or
so
at
a
time
the
men
were
allowed
to
come
officers
brought
their
great
capes
to
keep
the
girl
dry
boards
appeared
as
if
by
magic
for
her
to
stand
on
the
rain
and
the
bombardment
had
both
ceased
and
a
full
moon
made
the
lagoon
across
the
embankment
into
a
silver
lake
when
the
last
soup
had
been
dipped
from
the
tall
boiler
when
the
final
drops
of
chocolate
had
oozed
from
the
faucet
sara
lee
turned
and
went
back
to
the
little
house
again
but
before
she
went
she
stood
a
moment
staring
across
toward
that
land
of
the
shadow
on
the
other
side
where
henri
had
gone
and
had
not
returned
once
when
the
king
had
decorated
her
she
had
wished
that
wherever
uncle
james
might
be
on
the
other
side
he
could
see
what
was
happening
and
now
she
wondered
if
henri
could
know
that
she
had
come
back
and
was
again
looking
after
his
men
while
she
waited
for
that
reunion
he
had
so
firmly
believed
in
then
she
led
the
little
horse
back
along
the
road
at
the
poplar
trees
she
turned
and
looked
behind
toward
the
trenches
the
grove
was
but
a
skeleton
now
a
strange
and
jagged
thing
of
twisted
branches
as
though
it
had
died
in
agony
she
stood
there
while
the
pony
nuzzled
her
gently
if
she
called
would
he
come
but
then
all
of
life
was
one
call
now
for
her
she
went
on
slowly
after
that
it
was
not
unusual
for
her
to
go
to
the
trenches
on
such
nights
as
no
men
could
come
to
the
little
house
always
she
was
joyously
welcomed
and
always
on
her
way
back
she
turned
to
send
from
the
poplar
trees
that
inarticulate
aching
call
that
she
had
come
somehow
to
believe
in
january
wet
and
raw
went
by
february
colder
with
snow
was
half
over
the
men
had
ceased
to
watch
for
henri
over
the
parapet
and
his
brave
deeds
had
become
fireside
tales
to
be
told
at
home
if
ever
there
were
to
be
homes
again
for
them
then
one
night
henri
came
back
came
as
he
had
gone
out
of
the
shadows
that
had
swallowed
him
up
came
without
so
much
as
the
sound
of
a
sniper
rifle
to
herald
him
a
strange
thin
henri
close
to
starvation
dripping
water
over
everything
from
a
german
uniform
and
very
close
indeed
to
death
before
he
called
out
there
was
wild
excitement
indeed
bearded
private
soldiers
forgetting
that
name
and
rank
of
his
which
must
not
be
told
patted
his
thin
shoulders
officers
who
had
lived
through
such
horrors
as
also
may
not
be
told
crowded
about
him
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
with
each
other
it
was
as
though
from
the
graveyard
back
in
the
fields
had
come
alive
and
smiling
some
dearly
beloved
friend
he
would
have
told
the
story
but
he
was
wet
and
weary
that
can
wait
they
said
and
led
him
a
motley
band
of
officers
and
men
intermixed
for
once
forgetting
all
decorum
toward
the
village
they
overtook
the
lines
of
men
who
had
left
the
trenches
and
were
moving
with
their
slow
and
weary
gait
up
the
road
the
news
spread
through
the
column
there
were
muffled
cheers
figures
stepped
out
of
the
darkness
with
hands
out
henri
clasped
as
many
as
he
could
when
with
his
escort
he
had
passed
the
men
they
fell
almost
without
orders
into
columns
of
four
and
swung
in
behind
him
there
was
no
band
but
from
a
thousand
throats
yet
cautiously
until
they
passed
the
poplar
trees
there
gradually
swelled
and
grew
a
marching
song
behind
henri
a
strange
guard
of
honor
muddy
tired
torn
even
wounded
they
marched
and
sang
trou
là
là
ça
ne
va
guère
trou
là
là
çe
ne
va
pas
sara
lee
listening
for
that
first
shuffle
of
many
feet
that
sounded
so
like
the
wind
in
the
trees
or
water
over
the
pebbles
of
a
brook
paused
in
her
work
and
lifted
her
head
the
rhythm
of
marching
feet
came
through
the
wooden
shutters
the
very
building
seemed
to
vibrate
with
it
and
there
was
a
growling
sound
with
it
that
soon
she
knew
to
be
the
deep
voices
of
singing
men
she
went
to
the
door
and
stood
there
looking
down
the
street
behind
her
was
the
warm
glow
of
the
lamp
all
the
snug
invitation
of
the
little
house
a
group
of
soldiers
had
paused
in
front
of
the
doorway
and
from
them
one
emerged
tall
white
infinitely
weary
and
looked
up
at
her
with
unbelieving
eyes
after
all
there
are
no
words
for
such
meetings
henri
took
her
hand
still
with
that
sense
of
unreality
and
bent
over
it
and
sara
lee
touched
his
head
as
he
stooped
because
she
had
called
for
so
long
and
only
now
he
had
come
so
you
have
come
back
she
said
in
what
she
hoped
was
a
composed
tone
because
a
great
many
people
were
listening
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
it
is
you
who
have
come
back
mademoiselle
there
was
gayety
in
the
little
house
that
night
every
candle
was
lighted
they
were
stuck
in
rows
on
they
blazed
and
melted
into
strange
arcs
above
the
kitchen
stove
there
were
cigarettes
for
everybody
and
food
and
a
dry
uniform
rather
small
for
henri
marie
wept
over
her
soup
and
ran
every
few
moments
to
the
door
to
see
if
he
was
still
there
she
had
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
when
he
came
in
and
showed
signs
every
now
and
then
of
doing
it
again
sara
lee
did
her
bandaging
as
usual
but
with
shining
eyes
and
soon
after
henri
arrival
a
dispatch
rider
set
off
post
haste
with
certain
papers
and
maps
hurriedly
written
and
drawn
henri
had
not
only
returned
he
had
brought
back
information
of
great
value
to
all
the
allied
armies
so
sara
lee
bandaged
and
in
the
little
room
across
the
way
where
no
longer
harvey
photograph
sat
on
the
mantel
henri
told
his
story
to
the
officers
of
his
imprisonment
in
the
german
prison
at
crefeld
of
his
finding
jean
there
weeks
later
when
he
was
convalescing
from
typhoid
of
their
escape
and
long
wandering
of
jean
getting
into
holland
whence
he
would
return
by
way
of
england
of
his
own
business
of
what
he
had
done
behind
the
lines
after
jean
had
gone
he
said
nothing
but
his
listeners
knew
and
understood
but
his
dispatches
off
his
story
briefly
told
henri
wandered
out
among
the
men
again
he
was
very
happy
he
had
never
thought
to
be
so
happy
he
felt
the
touch
on
his
sleeves
of
hard
brown
not
overclean
hands
infinitely
tender
and
caressing
and
over
there
as
though
she
had
never
gone
was
sara
lee
slightly
flushed
and
very
radiant
and
as
though
he
also
had
never
gone
away
henri
pushed
into
the
à
and
stood
before
her
smiling
you
bandage
well
mademoiselle
he
said
gayly
but
i
i
bandage
better
see
now
a
turn
here
and
it
is
done
does
it
hurt
paul
the
man
in
the
dressing
chair
squirmed
and
grinned
sheepishly
the
iodine
he
explained
it
is
painful
then
i
shall
ask
you
a
question
and
you
will
forget
the
iodine
why
is
a
dead
german
like
the
tail
of
a
pig
paul
failed
the
room
failed
even
colonel
lilias
confessed
himself
at
fault
because
it
is
the
end
of
the
swine
explained
henri
and
looked
about
him
triumphantly
a
gust
of
laughter
spread
through
the
room
and
even
to
the
kitchen
a
door
banged
henri
upset
a
chair
there
was
noise
again
and
gayety
in
the
little
house
of
mercy
and
much
happiness
and
there
i
think
we
may
leave
them
all
henri
and
sara
lee
and
jean
of
the
one
eye
and
the
faithful
heart
and
marie
with
her
kettles
and
even
rené
who
still
in
some
strange
way
belonged
to
the
little
house
as
though
it
were
something
too
precious
to
abandon
the
amazing
interlude
had
become
the
play
itself
never
again
for
sara
lee
would
the
lights
go
up
in
front
and
henri
with
his
adoring
eyes
and
open
arms
fade
into
the
shadows
the
drama
of
the
war
plays
on
the
great
playwright
sees
fit
now
and
then
to
take
away
some
players
new
faces
appear
and
disappear
the
music
is
the
thunder
of
many
guns
henri
still
plays
his
big
part
sara
lee
her
little
one
yet
who
shall
say
in
the
end
which
one
has
done
the
better
there
are
new
and
ever
new
standards
but
love
remains
the
chief
and
love
is
sara
lee
one
quality
love
of
her
kind
of
tired
men
and
weary
the
love
that
shall
one
day
knit
this
broken
world
together
and
love
of
one
man
on
weary
nights
when
henri
is
again
lost
in
the
shadows
sara
lee
her
work
done
the
men
gone
sits
in
her
little
house
of
mercy
and
waits
the
stars
on
clear
evenings
shine
down
on
the
roofless
buildings
on
the
rubbish
that
was
once
the
mill
on
the
ruined
poplar
trees
and
on
the
small
acre
of
peace
where
tiny
crosses
mark
the
long
sleep
of
weary
soldiers
and
sometimes
though
she
knows
it
now
by
heart
she
reads
aloud
that
letter
of
henri
to
her
it
comforts
her
it
is
a
promise
if
that
is
to
be
then
think
of
me
somewhere
perhaps
with
rené
by
my
side
since
he
too
loved
you
and
i
shall
still
be
calling
you
and
waiting
perhaps
even
beyond
the
stars
they
have
need
of
a
little
house
of
mercy
and
god
knows
wherever
i
am
i
shall
have
need
of
you
the
end
