and
yet
edward
henry
machin
reflected
as
at
six
minutes
to
six
he
approached
his
own
dwelling
at
the
top
of
bleakridge
and
yet
i
do
feel
so
jolly
after
all
the
first
two
words
of
this
disturbing
meditation
had
reference
to
the
fact
that
by
telephoning
twice
to
his
stockbrokers
at
manchester
he
had
just
made
the
sum
of
three
hundred
and
pounds
in
a
purely
speculative
transaction
concerning
rubber
shares
it
was
in
the
autumn
of
the
great
gambling
year
he
had
simply
opened
his
lucky
and
wise
mouth
at
the
proper
moment
and
the
money
like
ripe
golden
fruit
had
fallen
into
it
a
gift
from
benign
heaven
surely
a
cause
for
happiness
and
yet
he
did
not
feel
so
jolly
he
was
surprised
he
was
even
a
little
hurt
to
discover
by
introspection
that
monetary
gain
was
not
necessarily
accompanied
by
felicity
nevertheless
this
very
successful
man
of
the
world
of
the
five
towns
having
been
born
on
the
of
may
had
reached
the
age
of
and
a
half
years
i
must
be
getting
older
he
reflected
he
was
right
he
was
still
young
as
every
man
of
will
agree
but
he
was
getting
older
a
few
years
ago
a
windfall
of
three
hundred
and
pounds
would
not
have
been
followed
by
morbid
it
would
have
been
followed
by
unreasoning
instinctive
elation
which
elation
would
have
endured
at
least
twelve
hours
as
he
disappeared
within
the
reddish
garden
wall
which
sheltered
his
abode
from
the
publicity
of
trafalgar
road
he
half
hoped
to
see
nellie
waiting
for
him
on
the
famous
marble
step
of
the
porch
for
the
woman
had
long
long
since
invented
a
way
of
scouting
for
his
advent
from
the
small
window
in
the
bathroom
but
there
was
nobody
on
the
marble
step
his
melancholy
increased
at
the
meal
he
had
complained
of
neuralgia
and
hence
this
was
an
evening
upon
which
he
might
fairly
have
expected
to
see
sympathy
charmingly
attired
in
the
porch
it
is
true
that
the
neuralgia
had
completely
gone
still
he
said
to
himself
with
justifiable
sardonic
gloom
how
does
she
know
my
neuralgia
gone
she
does
know
having
opened
the
with
the
thinnest
neatest
in
the
five
towns
he
entered
his
home
and
stumbled
slightly
over
a
brush
that
was
lying
against
the
sunk
he
gazed
at
that
brush
with
resentment
it
was
a
dilapidated
the
offensive
object
would
have
been
out
of
place
at
nightfall
in
the
lobby
of
any
house
but
in
the
lobby
of
his
house
the
house
which
he
had
planned
a
dozen
years
earlier
to
the
special
end
of
minimizing
domestic
labour
and
which
he
had
always
kept
up
to
date
with
the
latest
devices
in
his
lobby
the
spectacle
of
a
vile
outworn
at
amounted
to
a
scandal
less
than
a
fortnight
previously
he
had
purchased
and
presented
to
his
wife
a
marvellous
electric
surpassing
all
former
you
simply
attached
this
machine
by
a
cord
to
the
wall
like
a
dog
and
waved
it
in
mysterious
passes
over
the
floor
like
a
fan
and
the
house
was
clean
he
was
as
proud
of
this
machine
as
though
he
had
invented
it
instead
of
having
merely
bought
it
every
day
he
inquired
about
its
feats
expecting
enthusiastic
replies
as
a
sort
of
reward
for
his
own
keenness
and
be
it
said
that
he
had
had
enthusiastic
replies
and
now
this
obscene
as
he
carefully
removed
his
hat
and
his
beautiful
new
melton
overcoat
which
had
the
colour
and
the
soft
smoothness
of
a
damson
he
animadverted
upon
the
astounding
negligence
of
women
there
were
nellie
his
wife
his
mother
the
nurse
the
cook
the
maid
five
of
them
and
in
his
mind
they
had
all
plotted
together
a
conspiracy
of
carelessness
to
leave
the
inexcusable
tool
in
his
lobby
for
him
to
stumble
over
what
was
the
use
of
accidentally
procuring
three
hundred
and
pounds
still
no
sign
of
nellie
though
he
purposely
made
a
noisy
rattle
with
his
ebon
then
the
maid
burst
out
of
the
kitchen
with
a
tray
and
the
principal
utensils
for
high
tea
thereon
she
had
a
guilty
air
the
household
was
evidently
late
two
steps
at
a
time
he
rushed
upstairs
to
the
bathroom
so
as
to
be
waiting
in
the
at
six
precisely
in
order
if
possible
to
shame
the
household
and
fill
it
with
remorse
and
unpleasantness
yet
ordinarily
he
was
not
a
very
prompt
man
nor
did
he
delight
in
giving
pain
on
the
contrary
he
was
apt
to
be
casual
blithe
and
agreeable
the
bathroom
was
his
peculiar
domain
which
he
was
always
modernizing
and
where
his
talent
for
the
ingenious
organization
of
comfort
and
his
utter
indifference
to
aesthetic
beauty
had
the
fullest
scope
by
universal
consent
admitted
to
be
the
finest
bathroom
in
the
five
towns
it
typified
the
whole
house
he
was
disappointed
on
this
occasion
to
see
no
untidy
trace
in
it
of
the
children
ablution
some
transgression
of
the
supreme
domestic
law
that
the
bathroom
must
always
be
free
and
immaculate
when
father
wanted
it
would
have
suited
his
gathering
humour
as
he
washed
his
hands
and
cleansed
his
nails
with
a
that
had
cost
five
shillings
and
sixpence
he
glanced
at
himself
in
the
mirror
which
he
was
splashing
a
stoutish
fair
chubby
man
with
a
short
bright
beard
and
plenteous
bright
hair
his
necktie
pleased
him
the
elegance
of
his
wristbands
pleased
him
and
he
liked
the
rich
down
on
his
forearms
he
could
not
believe
that
he
looked
and
a
half
and
yet
he
had
recently
had
an
idea
of
shaving
off
his
beard
partly
to
defy
time
but
partly
also
i
must
admit
because
a
friend
had
suggested
to
him
wildly
perhaps
that
if
he
dispensed
with
a
beard
his
hair
might
grow
more
sturdily
yes
there
was
one
weak
spot
in
the
middle
of
the
top
of
his
head
where
the
crop
had
of
late
disconcertingly
thinned
the
hairdresser
had
informed
him
that
the
symptom
would
vanish
under
electric
massage
and
that
if
he
doubted
the
of
hairdressers
any
doctor
would
testify
to
the
value
of
electric
massage
but
now
edward
henry
machin
strangely
discouraged
inexplicably
robbed
of
the
zest
of
existence
decided
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
shave
off
his
beard
nothing
was
worth
while
if
he
was
and
a
half
he
was
and
a
half
to
become
bald
was
the
common
lot
moreover
beardless
he
would
need
the
service
of
a
barber
every
day
and
he
was
absolutely
persuaded
that
not
a
barber
worth
the
name
could
be
found
in
the
five
towns
he
actually
went
to
manchester
miles
to
get
his
hair
cut
the
operation
never
cost
him
less
than
a
sovereign
and
half
a
day
time
and
he
honestly
deemed
himself
to
be
a
fellow
of
simple
tastes
such
is
the
effect
of
the
canker
of
luxury
happily
he
could
afford
these
simple
tastes
for
although
not
rich
in
the
modern
significance
of
the
term
he
paid
income
tax
on
some
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
without
quite
convincing
the
surveyor
of
taxes
that
he
was
an
honest
man
he
brushed
the
thick
hair
over
the
weak
spot
he
turned
down
his
wristbands
he
brushed
the
collar
of
his
jacket
and
lastly
his
beard
and
he
put
on
his
jacket
with
a
certain
care
for
he
was
very
neat
and
then
reflectively
twisting
his
moustache
to
military
points
he
spied
through
the
smaller
window
to
see
whether
the
new
high
hoarding
of
the
really
did
prevent
a
serious
observer
from
descrying
wayfarers
as
they
breasted
the
hill
from
hanbridge
it
did
not
then
he
spied
through
the
larger
window
upon
the
yard
to
see
whether
the
wall
of
the
new
rooms
which
he
had
lately
added
to
his
house
showed
any
further
trace
of
damp
and
whether
the
new
chauffeur
was
washing
the
new
motor
car
with
all
his
heart
the
wall
showed
no
further
trace
of
damp
and
the
new
chauffeur
bent
back
seemed
to
symbolize
an
extreme
conscientiousness
then
the
clock
on
the
landing
struck
six
and
he
hurried
off
to
put
the
household
to
open
shame
ii
nellie
came
into
the
two
minutes
after
her
husband
as
edward
henry
had
laboriously
counted
these
two
minutes
almost
second
by
second
on
the
clock
he
was
very
tired
of
waiting
his
secret
annoyance
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
nellie
took
off
her
white
apron
in
the
doorway
and
flung
it
hurriedly
on
to
the
which
during
the
progress
of
meals
was
established
outside
the
door
he
did
not
actually
witness
this
operation
of
undressing
because
nellie
was
screened
by
the
door
but
he
was
entirely
aware
of
it
he
disliked
it
and
he
had
always
disliked
it
when
nellie
was
at
work
either
as
a
mother
or
as
the
owner
of
certain
fine
silver
ornaments
he
rather
enjoyed
the
wonderful
white
apron
for
it
suited
her
temperament
but
as
the
head
of
a
household
with
six
thousand
pounds
a
year
at
its
disposal
he
objected
to
any
hint
of
the
thing
at
meals
and
he
objected
to
it
altogether
who
could
guess
from
the
homeliness
of
their
family
life
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
spend
a
hundred
pounds
a
week
and
still
have
enough
income
left
over
to
pay
the
salary
of
a
town
clerk
or
so
nobody
could
guess
and
he
felt
that
people
ought
to
be
able
to
guess
when
he
was
young
he
would
have
esteemed
an
income
of
six
thousand
pounds
a
year
as
necessarily
implicating
feudal
state
valets
castles
yachts
family
solicitors
county
society
and
a
drawling
london
accent
why
should
his
wife
wear
an
apron
at
all
but
the
sad
truth
was
that
neither
his
wife
nor
his
mother
ever
rich
or
even
endeavoured
to
look
rich
his
mother
would
carry
an
sealskin
as
though
she
had
picked
it
up
at
a
jumble
sale
and
his
wife
put
such
simplicity
into
the
wearing
of
a
pound
diamond
ring
that
its
expensiveness
was
generally
quite
wasted
and
yet
while
the
logical
male
in
him
scathingly
condemned
this
feminine
defect
of
character
his
private
soul
was
glad
of
it
for
he
well
knew
that
he
would
have
been
considerably
irked
by
the
complexities
and
grandeurs
of
high
life
but
never
would
he
have
admitted
this
nellie
face
as
she
sat
down
was
not
limpid
he
understood
naught
of
it
more
than
twenty
years
had
passed
since
they
had
first
met
he
and
a
wistful
little
creature
at
a
historic
dance
he
could
still
see
the
wistful
little
creature
in
those
placid
and
pure
features
in
that
buxom
body
but
now
there
was
a
formidable
capable
and
experienced
woman
there
too
impossible
to
credit
that
the
wistful
little
creature
was
but
she
was
indeed
it
was
very
doubtful
if
she
would
ever
see
again
once
he
had
had
the
most
romantic
feelings
about
her
he
could
recall
the
slim
flexibility
of
her
waist
the
timorous
melting
invitation
of
her
eyes
and
now
such
was
human
existence
she
sat
up
erect
on
her
chair
she
did
not
apologize
for
being
late
she
made
no
inquiry
as
to
his
neuralgia
on
the
other
hand
she
was
not
cross
she
was
just
neutral
polite
cheerful
and
apparently
conscious
of
perfection
he
strongly
desired
to
inform
her
of
the
exact
time
of
day
but
his
lips
would
not
articulate
the
words
maud
she
said
with
divine
calm
to
the
maid
who
bore
in
the
baked
york
ham
under
its
silver
canopy
you
have
taken
away
that
brush
that
in
the
passage
another
illustration
of
nellie
inability
to
live
up
to
six
thousand
pounds
a
year
she
would
always
refer
to
the
hall
as
the
passage
please
i
did
m
replied
maud
now
as
conscious
of
perfection
as
her
mistress
he
must
have
took
it
back
again
who
demanded
the
master
carlo
sir
upon
which
triumph
maud
retired
edward
henry
was
dashed
nevertheless
he
quickly
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
and
sought
about
for
a
justification
of
his
previous
verdict
upon
the
negligence
of
five
women
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
put
the
brush
where
the
dog
could
get
at
it
he
said
but
he
said
this
strictly
to
himself
he
could
not
say
it
aloud
nor
could
he
say
aloud
the
words
neuralgia
three
hundred
and
pounds
any
more
than
he
could
say
late
that
he
was
in
a
peculiar
mental
condition
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
he
did
not
remark
the
absence
of
his
mother
until
he
was
putting
her
share
of
baked
ham
on
to
a
plate
he
thought
this
is
a
bit
thick
this
is
meaning
the
extreme
lateness
of
his
mother
for
the
meal
but
his
only
audible
remark
was
a
somewhat
impatient
banging
down
of
the
hot
plate
in
front
of
his
mother
empty
chair
in
answer
to
this
banging
nellie
quietly
began
your
mother
he
knew
instantly
then
that
nellie
was
disturbed
about
something
or
other
and
lived
together
under
one
roof
in
perfect
amity
nay
more
they
often
formed
powerful
and
unscrupulous
leagues
against
him
but
whenever
nellie
was
disturbed
by
no
matter
what
she
would
say
your
mother
instead
of
merely
mother
it
was
an
extraordinary
subtle
silly
and
effective
way
of
putting
him
in
the
wrong
your
mother
is
staying
upstairs
with
robert
robert
was
the
eldest
child
aged
eight
oh
breathed
edward
henry
he
might
have
inquired
what
the
nurse
was
for
he
might
have
inquired
how
his
mother
meant
to
get
her
tea
but
he
refrained
adding
simply
what
up
now
and
in
retort
to
his
wife
your
he
laid
a
faint
emphasis
on
the
word
now
to
imply
that
those
women
were
always
inventing
some
fresh
imaginary
woe
for
the
children
carlo
bitten
him
in
the
calf
said
nellie
tightening
her
lips
this
at
any
rate
was
not
imaginary
the
kid
was
teasing
him
as
usual
i
suppose
he
suggested
that
i
do
know
said
nellie
but
i
know
we
must
get
rid
of
that
dog
serious
of
course
we
must
nellie
insisted
with
an
inadvertent
heat
which
she
immediately
cooled
i
mean
the
bite
well
it
a
bite
right
enough
and
you
thinking
of
hydrophobia
death
amid
horrible
agony
and
so
on
no
i
not
she
said
stoutly
trying
to
smile
but
he
knew
she
was
and
he
knew
also
that
the
bite
was
a
trifle
if
it
had
been
a
good
bite
she
would
have
made
it
enormous
she
would
have
hinted
that
the
dog
had
left
a
chasm
in
the
boy
flesh
yes
you
are
he
continued
to
twit
her
encouraged
by
her
attempt
at
a
smile
however
the
smile
expired
i
suppose
you
wo
deny
that
carlo
teeth
may
have
been
dirty
always
nosing
in
some
filth
or
other
she
said
challengingly
in
a
measured
tone
of
sagacity
and
there
may
be
blood
fiddlesticks
exclaimed
edward
henry
such
a
nonsensical
and
infantile
rejoinder
deserved
no
answer
and
it
received
none
shortly
afterwards
maud
entered
and
whispered
that
nellie
was
wanted
upstairs
as
soon
as
his
wife
had
gone
edward
henry
rang
the
bell
maud
he
said
bring
me
the
out
of
my
overcoat
pocket
and
he
defiantly
finished
his
meal
at
leisure
with
the
news
of
the
day
propped
up
against
the
which
he
had
set
before
him
instead
of
the
dish
of
ham
iii
later
catching
through
the
open
door
fragments
of
a
conversation
on
the
stairs
which
indicated
that
his
mother
was
at
last
coming
down
for
tea
he
sped
like
a
threatened
delinquent
into
the
he
had
no
wish
to
encounter
his
mother
though
that
woman
usually
said
little
the
after
the
bathroom
was
edward
henry
favourite
district
in
the
home
since
he
could
not
spend
the
whole
of
his
time
in
the
bathroom
and
he
could
not
he
wisely
gave
a
special
care
to
the
and
he
loved
it
as
one
always
loves
that
upon
which
one
has
bestowed
benefits
he
was
proud
of
the
and
he
had
the
right
to
be
the
principal
object
in
it
at
night
was
the
electric
chandelier
which
would
have
been
adequate
for
a
lighthouse
edward
henry
eyes
were
not
what
they
used
to
be
and
the
minor
advertisements
in
the
which
constituted
his
sole
evening
perusals
often
lacked
legibility
edward
henry
sincerely
believed
in
light
and
heat
he
was
almost
the
only
person
in
the
five
towns
who
did
in
the
five
towns
people
have
fires
in
their
grates
not
to
warm
the
room
but
to
make
the
room
bright
seemingly
they
use
their
pride
to
keep
themselves
warm
at
any
rate
whenever
edward
henry
talked
to
them
of
radiators
they
would
sternly
reply
that
a
radiator
did
not
and
could
not
brighten
a
room
edward
henry
had
made
the
great
discovery
that
an
efficient
chandelier
will
brighten
a
room
better
even
than
a
fire
and
he
had
gilded
his
radiator
the
notion
of
gilding
the
radiator
was
not
his
own
he
had
seen
a
gilded
radiator
in
the
newest
hotel
at
birmingham
and
had
rejoiced
as
some
peculiar
souls
rejoice
when
they
meet
a
fine
line
in
a
new
poem
in
concession
to
popular
prejudice
edward
henry
had
in
his
house
and
fires
therein
during
exceptionally
frosty
weather
but
this
did
not
save
him
from
being
regarded
in
the
five
towns
as
in
some
ways
a
peculiar
soul
the
effulgent
source
of
dark
heat
was
scientifically
situated
in
front
of
the
window
and
on
ordinarily
cold
evenings
edward
henry
and
his
wife
and
mother
and
an
acquaintance
if
one
happened
to
come
in
would
gather
round
the
radiator
and
play
bridge
or
dummy
whist
the
other
phenomena
of
the
which
particularly
interested
edward
henry
were
the
turkey
carpet
the
four
vast
the
sofa
the
imposing
and
the
mechanical
at
one
brief
period
he
had
hovered
a
good
deal
about
the
revolving
bookcase
containing
the
to
which
his
collection
of
books
was
limited
but
the
frail
passion
for
literature
had
not
survived
a
struggle
with
the
seductions
of
the
mechanical
the
walls
of
the
room
never
drew
his
notice
he
had
chosen
some
years
before
a
patent
washable
kind
of
which
could
be
wiped
over
with
a
damp
cloth
and
he
had
also
chosen
the
pattern
of
the
paper
but
it
is
a
fact
that
he
could
spend
hours
in
any
room
without
even
seeing
the
pattern
of
its
paper
in
the
same
way
his
cushions
and
little
draperies
and
bows
were
invisible
to
him
though
he
had
searched
for
and
duly
obtained
the
perfect
quality
of
swansdown
which
filled
the
cushions
the
one
ornament
of
the
walls
which
attracted
him
was
a
large
and
of
a
ruined
castle
in
the
midst
of
a
sombre
forest
through
which
cows
were
strolling
in
the
tower
of
the
castle
was
a
clock
and
this
clock
was
a
realistic
timepiece
whose
fingers
moved
and
told
the
hour
two
of
the
oriel
windows
of
the
castle
were
realistic
holes
in
its
masonry
through
one
of
them
you
could
put
a
key
to
wind
up
the
clock
and
through
the
other
you
could
put
a
key
to
wind
up
the
secret
musical
box
which
played
sixteen
different
tunes
he
had
bought
this
handsome
relic
of
the
victorian
era
not
less
artistic
despite
your
scorn
than
many
devices
for
satisfying
the
higher
instincts
of
the
present
day
at
an
auction
sale
in
the
strand
london
but
it
too
had
been
supplanted
in
his
esteem
by
the
mechanical
he
now
selected
an
example
of
the
most
expensive
cigar
in
the
and
lighted
it
as
only
a
connoisseur
can
light
a
cigar
lovingly
he
blew
out
the
match
lingeringly
with
regret
and
dropped
it
and
the
cigar
red
collar
with
care
into
a
large
copper
bowl
on
the
centre
table
instead
of
flinging
it
against
the
japanese
umbrella
in
the
fireplace
a
grave
disadvantage
of
radiators
is
that
you
can
not
throw
odds
and
ends
into
them
he
chose
the
most
expensive
cigar
because
he
wanted
comfort
and
peace
the
ham
was
not
digesting
very
well
then
he
sat
down
and
applied
himself
to
the
property
advertisements
in
the
a
form
of
sensational
serial
which
usually
enthralled
him
but
not
he
allowed
the
paper
to
lapse
on
to
the
floor
and
then
rose
impatiently
rearranged
the
thick
dark
blue
curtains
behind
the
radiator
and
finally
yielded
to
the
silent
call
of
the
mechanical
he
quite
knew
that
to
dally
with
the
while
smoking
a
cigar
was
to
insult
the
cigar
but
he
did
not
care
he
tilted
the
cigar
upwards
from
an
extreme
corner
of
his
mouth
and
through
the
celestial
smoke
gazed
at
the
titles
of
the
new
music
rolls
which
had
been
delivered
that
day
and
which
were
ranged
on
the
top
of
the
piano
itself
and
while
he
did
so
he
was
thinking
why
in
thunder
did
the
little
thing
come
and
tell
me
at
once
about
that
kid
and
his
i
wonder
why
she
did
she
seemed
only
to
mention
it
by
accident
i
wonder
why
she
did
bounce
into
the
bathroom
and
tell
me
at
once
but
it
was
untrue
that
he
sought
vainly
for
an
answer
to
this
riddle
he
was
aware
of
the
answer
he
even
kept
saying
over
the
answer
to
himself
she
made
up
her
mind
i
been
teasing
her
a
bit
too
much
lately
about
those
kids
and
their
precious
illnesses
and
she
doing
the
dignified
that
what
she
doing
she
doing
the
dignified
of
course
instantly
after
his
tea
he
ought
to
have
gone
upstairs
to
inspect
the
wounded
victim
of
dogs
the
victim
was
his
own
child
and
its
mother
was
his
wife
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
have
gone
upstairs
long
since
he
knew
that
he
ought
now
to
go
and
the
sooner
the
better
but
somehow
he
could
not
go
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
in
the
minor
and
major
crises
of
married
life
there
are
not
two
partners
but
four
each
partner
has
a
dual
personality
each
partner
is
indeed
two
different
persons
and
one
of
these
fights
against
the
other
with
the
common
result
of
a
fatal
inaction
the
wickeder
of
the
opposing
persons
in
edward
henry
getting
the
upper
hand
of
the
more
virtuous
sniggered
dirty
teeth
indeed
indeed
why
not
rabies
while
she
about
it
i
guarantee
she
dreaming
of
coffins
and
mourning
coaches
already
scanning
nonchalantly
the
titles
of
the
music
rolls
he
suddenly
saw
funeral
march
chopin
she
shall
have
it
he
said
affixing
the
roll
to
the
mechanism
and
added
whatever
it
is
for
he
was
not
acquainted
with
the
funeral
march
from
pianoforte
sonata
his
musical
education
had
in
truth
begun
only
a
year
earlier
with
the
advertisements
of
the
pianisto
mechanical
player
he
was
a
judge
of
advertisements
and
the
pianisto
literature
pleased
him
in
a
high
degree
he
justifiably
reckoned
that
he
could
distinguish
between
honest
and
dishonest
advertising
he
made
a
deep
study
of
the
question
of
mechanical
players
and
deliberately
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
pianisto
was
the
best
it
was
also
the
most
costly
but
one
of
the
conveniences
of
having
six
thousand
pounds
a
year
is
that
you
need
not
deny
yourself
the
best
mechanical
player
because
it
happens
to
be
the
most
costly
he
bought
a
pianisto
and
incidentally
he
bought
a
superb
grand
piano
and
exiled
the
old
cottage
piano
to
the
nursery
the
pianisto
was
the
best
partly
because
like
the
it
could
be
operated
by
electricity
and
partly
because
by
means
of
certain
curved
lines
on
the
unrolling
paper
and
of
certain
levers
and
clutches
it
enabled
the
operator
to
put
his
secret
ardent
soul
into
the
music
assuredly
it
had
given
edward
henry
a
taste
for
music
the
whole
world
of
musical
compositions
was
his
to
conquer
and
he
conquered
it
at
the
rate
of
about
two
great
masters
a
month
from
handel
to
richard
strauss
even
from
palestrina
to
debussy
the
achievements
of
genius
lay
at
his
mercy
he
criticized
them
with
a
freedom
that
was
entirely
unprejudiced
by
tradition
beethoven
was
no
more
to
him
than
arthur
sullivan
indeed
was
rather
less
the
works
of
his
choice
were
the
tannhäuser
overture
a
potpourri
of
aida
chopin
study
in
thirds
which
ravished
him
and
a
selection
from
the
merry
widow
which
also
ravished
him
so
that
on
the
whole
it
may
be
said
that
he
had
a
very
good
natural
taste
he
at
once
liked
chopin
funeral
march
he
entered
profoundly
into
the
spirit
of
it
with
the
levers
he
produced
in
a
marvellous
fashion
the
long
tragic
roll
of
the
drums
and
by
the
manipulation
of
a
clutch
he
distilled
into
the
chant
at
the
graveside
a
melancholy
sweetness
that
rent
the
heart
the
later
crescendoes
were
overwhelming
and
as
he
played
there
with
the
bright
blaze
of
the
chandelier
on
his
fair
hair
and
beard
and
the
blue
cigar
smoke
in
his
nostrils
and
the
effluence
of
the
gilded
radiator
behind
him
and
the
intimacy
of
the
drawn
and
the
closed
and
curtained
door
folding
him
in
from
the
world
and
the
agony
of
the
music
grieving
his
artistic
soul
to
the
core
as
he
played
there
he
grew
gradually
happier
and
happier
and
the
zest
of
existence
seemed
to
return
it
was
not
only
that
he
felt
the
elemental
unfathomable
satisfaction
of
a
male
who
is
sheltered
in
solitude
from
a
pack
of
women
that
have
got
on
his
nerves
there
was
also
the
more
piquant
assurance
that
he
was
behaving
in
a
very
sprightly
manner
how
long
was
it
since
he
had
accomplished
anything
worthy
of
his
ancient
reputation
as
a
card
as
the
card
of
the
five
towns
he
could
not
say
but
now
he
knew
that
he
was
being
a
card
again
the
whole
town
would
smile
and
forgive
and
admire
if
it
learnt
that
nellie
invaded
the
room
she
had
resumed
the
affray
denry
she
reproached
him
in
an
uncontrolled
voice
i
ashamed
of
you
i
really
am
she
was
no
longer
doing
the
dignified
the
mask
was
off
and
the
unmistakable
lineaments
of
the
outraged
mother
appeared
that
she
should
address
him
as
denry
proved
the
intensity
of
her
agitation
years
ago
when
he
had
been
made
an
alderman
his
wife
and
his
mother
had
decided
that
denry
was
no
longer
a
suitable
name
for
him
and
had
abandoned
it
in
favour
of
edward
henry
he
ceased
playing
why
he
protested
with
a
ridiculous
air
of
innocence
i
only
playing
chopin
ca
i
play
chopin
he
was
rather
surprised
and
impressed
that
she
had
recognized
the
piece
for
what
it
was
but
of
course
she
did
as
a
fact
know
something
about
music
he
remembered
though
she
never
touched
the
pianisto
i
think
it
a
pity
you
ca
choose
some
other
evening
for
your
funeral
marches
she
exclaimed
if
that
it
said
edward
henry
like
lightning
why
did
you
stick
me
out
you
were
afraid
of
hydrophobia
i
thank
you
to
come
upstairs
she
replied
with
warmth
oh
all
right
my
dear
all
right
he
cooed
and
they
went
upstairs
in
a
rather
solemn
procession
iv
nellie
led
the
way
to
the
chamber
known
as
maisie
room
where
the
youngest
of
the
machins
was
wont
to
sleep
in
charge
of
the
nurse
who
under
the
supervision
of
the
mother
of
all
three
had
dominion
over
robert
ralph
and
their
little
sister
the
first
thing
that
edward
henry
noticed
was
the
screen
which
shut
off
one
of
the
beds
the
unfurling
of
the
screen
was
always
a
sure
sign
that
nellie
was
taking
an
infantile
illness
seriously
it
was
an
indication
to
edward
henry
of
the
importance
of
the
in
nellie
esteem
when
all
the
chicks
of
the
brood
happened
to
be
simultaneously
sound
the
screen
reposed
inconspicuous
at
an
angle
against
a
wall
behind
the
door
but
when
pestilence
was
abroad
the
screen
travelled
from
one
room
to
another
in
the
wake
of
it
and
spreading
wide
took
part
in
the
battle
of
life
and
death
in
an
angle
of
the
screen
on
the
side
of
it
away
from
the
bed
and
near
the
fire
in
times
of
stress
nellie
would
not
rely
on
radiators
sat
old
machin
knitting
she
was
a
thin
bony
woman
of
years
and
as
hard
and
imperishable
as
teak
so
far
as
her
son
knew
she
had
only
had
two
illnesses
in
her
life
the
first
was
an
attack
of
influenza
and
the
second
was
an
attack
of
acute
rheumatism
which
had
incapacitated
her
for
several
weeks
edward
henry
and
nellie
had
taken
advantage
of
her
helplessness
then
to
force
her
to
give
up
her
barbaric
cottage
in
brougham
street
and
share
permanently
the
splendid
comfort
of
their
home
she
existed
in
their
home
like
a
philosophic
at
the
court
of
conquerors
behaving
faultlessly
behaving
magnanimously
in
the
melancholy
grandeur
of
her
fall
but
never
renouncing
her
secret
independence
nor
permitting
herself
to
forget
that
she
was
on
foreign
ground
when
edward
henry
looked
at
those
yellow
and
seasoned
fingers
which
by
hard
manual
labour
had
kept
herself
and
him
in
the
young
days
of
his
humble
obscurity
and
which
during
sixty
years
had
not
been
idle
for
more
than
six
weeks
in
all
he
grew
almost
apologetic
for
his
wealth
they
reminded
him
of
the
day
when
his
total
resources
were
five
pounds
won
in
a
wager
and
of
the
day
when
he
drove
proudly
about
behind
a
mule
collecting
other
people
rents
and
of
the
glittering
days
when
he
burst
in
on
her
from
llandudno
with
over
a
thousand
gold
sovereigns
in
a
product
of
his
first
great
picturesque
coup
imagining
himself
to
be
an
english
jay
gould
she
had
not
blenched
even
then
she
had
not
blenched
since
and
she
never
would
blench
in
spite
of
his
gorgeous
position
and
his
unique
reputation
in
spite
of
her
but
notorious
pride
in
him
he
still
went
in
fear
of
that
ageless
woman
whose
undaunted
eye
always
told
him
that
he
was
still
the
lad
denry
and
her
inferior
in
moral
force
the
curve
of
her
thin
lips
seemed
ever
to
be
warning
him
that
with
her
pretensions
were
quite
useless
and
that
she
saw
through
him
and
through
him
to
the
innermost
grottoes
of
his
poor
human
depravity
he
caught
her
eye
guiltily
behold
the
alderman
she
murmured
with
grimness
that
was
all
but
the
three
words
took
thirty
years
off
his
back
snatched
the
cigar
out
of
his
hand
and
reduced
him
again
to
the
raw
hungry
boy
of
brougham
street
and
he
knew
that
he
had
sinned
gravely
in
not
coming
upstairs
very
much
earlier
is
that
you
father
called
the
high
voice
of
robert
from
the
back
of
the
screen
he
had
to
admit
to
his
son
that
it
was
he
the
infant
lay
on
his
back
in
maisie
bed
while
his
mother
sat
lightly
on
the
edge
of
nurse
bed
near
by
well
you
a
nice
chap
said
edward
henry
avoiding
glance
but
trying
to
face
his
son
as
one
innocent
man
may
face
another
and
not
perfectly
succeeding
he
never
could
feel
like
a
real
father
somehow
my
temperature
above
normal
announced
robert
proudly
and
then
added
with
regret
but
not
much
there
was
the
clinical
thermometer
instrument
which
edward
henry
despised
and
detested
as
being
an
inciter
of
illnesses
in
a
glass
of
water
on
the
table
between
the
two
beds
father
robert
began
again
well
robert
said
edward
henry
cheerfully
he
was
glad
that
the
child
was
in
one
of
his
rare
loquacious
moods
because
the
chatter
not
only
proved
that
the
dog
had
done
no
serious
damage
it
also
eased
the
silent
strain
between
himself
and
nellie
why
did
you
play
the
funeral
march
father
asked
robert
and
the
question
fell
into
the
tranquillity
of
the
room
rather
like
a
bomb
that
had
not
quite
decided
whether
or
not
to
burst
for
the
second
time
that
evening
edward
henry
was
dashed
have
you
been
meddling
with
my
music
rolls
no
father
i
only
read
the
labels
this
child
simply
read
everything
how
did
you
know
i
was
playing
a
funeral
march
edward
henry
demanded
oh
did
tell
him
nellie
put
in
excusing
herself
before
she
was
accused
she
smiled
benignly
as
an
capable
of
forgiving
all
but
there
were
moments
when
edward
henry
hated
moral
superiority
and
christian
meekness
in
a
wife
moreover
nellie
somewhat
spoiled
her
own
effect
by
adding
with
an
artificial
continuation
of
the
smile
you
need
look
at
edward
henry
considered
the
remark
otiose
though
he
had
indeed
ventured
to
look
at
her
he
had
not
looked
at
her
in
the
manner
which
she
implied
it
made
a
noise
like
funerals
and
things
robert
explained
well
it
seems
to
me
been
playing
a
funeral
march
said
edward
henry
to
the
child
he
thought
this
rather
funny
rather
worthy
of
himself
but
the
child
answered
with
ruthless
gravity
and
a
touch
of
disdain
for
he
was
a
disdainful
child
without
bowels
i
do
know
what
you
mean
father
the
curve
of
his
lips
he
had
his
grandmother
lips
appeared
to
say
i
wish
you
would
try
to
be
silly
father
however
youth
forgets
very
quickly
and
the
next
instant
robert
was
beginning
once
more
father
well
robert
by
mutual
agreement
of
the
parents
the
child
was
never
addressed
as
bob
or
bobby
or
by
any
other
diminutive
in
their
practical
opinion
a
child
name
was
his
name
and
ought
not
to
be
mauled
or
dismembered
on
the
pretext
of
fondness
similarly
the
child
had
not
been
baptized
after
his
father
or
after
any
male
member
of
either
the
machin
or
the
cotterill
family
why
should
family
names
be
perpetuated
merely
because
they
were
family
names
a
natural
human
reaction
this
against
the
excessive
sentimentalism
of
the
victorian
era
what
does
out
mean
robert
inquired
now
robert
among
other
activities
busied
himself
in
the
collection
of
postage
stamps
and
in
consequence
his
father
mind
under
the
impulse
of
the
question
ran
immediately
to
postage
stamps
stamped
out
said
edward
henry
with
the
air
of
omniscience
that
a
father
is
bound
to
assume
postage
stamps
are
stamped
out
by
a
machine
you
see
robert
scorn
of
this
explanation
was
manifest
well
edward
henry
piqued
made
another
attempt
you
stamp
a
fire
out
with
your
feet
and
he
stamped
illustratively
on
the
floor
after
all
the
child
was
only
eight
i
knew
all
that
before
said
robert
coldly
you
do
understand
what
makes
you
ask
dear
let
us
show
father
your
leg
voice
was
soothing
yes
robert
murmured
staring
reflectively
at
the
ceiling
it
it
says
in
the
that
hydrophobia
is
stamped
out
in
this
country
by
long
muzzling
order
who
is
long
a
second
bomb
had
fallen
on
exactly
the
same
spot
as
the
first
and
the
two
exploded
simultaneously
and
the
explosion
was
none
the
less
terrible
because
it
was
silent
and
invisible
the
tidy
domestic
chamber
was
strewn
in
a
moment
with
an
awful
mass
of
wounded
susceptibilities
beyond
the
screen
the
of
steel
needles
stopped
and
started
again
it
was
characteristic
of
her
temperament
that
she
should
recover
before
the
younger
generations
could
recover
edward
henry
as
befitted
his
sex
regained
his
nerve
a
little
earlier
than
nellie
i
told
you
never
to
touch
my
said
he
sternly
robert
had
twice
been
caught
on
his
stomach
on
the
floor
with
a
vast
volume
open
under
his
chin
and
his
studies
had
been
traced
by
vile
i
know
said
robert
whenever
anybody
gave
that
child
a
piece
of
unsolicited
information
he
almost
invariably
replied
i
know
but
hydrophobia
cried
nellie
how
did
you
know
about
hydrophobia
we
had
it
in
spellings
last
week
robert
explained
the
deuce
you
did
muttered
edward
henry
the
one
bright
facet
of
the
and
gloomy
crisis
was
the
very
obvious
truth
that
robert
was
the
most
extraordinary
child
that
ever
lived
but
when
on
earth
did
you
get
at
the
robert
his
mother
exclaimed
completely
at
a
loss
it
was
before
you
came
in
from
hillport
the
wondrous
infant
answered
after
my
leg
had
stopped
hurting
me
a
bit
but
when
i
came
in
nurse
said
it
had
only
just
happened
shows
how
much
knew
said
robert
with
contempt
does
your
leg
hurt
you
now
edward
henry
inquired
a
bit
that
why
i
ca
go
to
sleep
of
course
well
let
have
a
look
at
it
edward
henry
attempted
jollity
mother
wrapped
it
all
up
in
boracic
wool
the
were
drawn
down
and
the
leg
gradually
revealed
and
the
sight
of
the
little
soft
leg
so
fragile
and
defenceless
really
did
touch
edward
henry
it
made
him
feel
more
like
an
authentic
father
than
he
had
felt
for
a
long
time
and
the
sight
of
the
red
wound
hurt
him
still
it
was
a
beautifully
clean
wound
and
it
was
not
a
large
wound
it
a
clean
wound
he
observed
judiciously
in
spite
of
himself
he
could
not
keep
a
certain
flippant
harsh
quality
out
of
his
tone
well
i
naturally
washed
it
with
carbolic
nellie
returned
sharply
he
illogically
resented
this
sharpness
of
course
he
was
bitten
through
his
stocking
of
course
said
nellie
the
wound
hastily
as
though
edward
henry
was
not
worthy
to
regard
it
well
then
by
the
time
they
got
through
the
stocking
the
teeth
could
be
dirty
everyone
knows
that
nellie
shut
her
lips
were
you
teasing
carlo
edward
henry
demanded
curtly
of
his
son
i
do
know
whenever
anybody
asked
that
child
for
a
piece
of
information
he
almost
invariably
replied
i
do
know
how
you
do
know
you
must
know
whether
you
were
teasing
the
dog
or
not
edward
henry
was
nettled
the
renewed
spectacle
of
his
own
wound
had
predisposed
robert
to
feel
a
great
and
tearful
sympathy
for
himself
his
mouth
now
began
to
take
strange
shapes
and
to
increase
magically
in
area
and
beads
appeared
in
the
corners
of
his
large
eyes
i
i
was
only
measuring
his
tail
by
his
hind
leg
he
blubbered
and
then
sobbed
edward
henry
did
his
best
to
save
his
dignity
come
come
he
reasoned
less
menacingly
boys
who
can
read
must
be
you
no
business
measuring
carlo
tail
by
his
hind
leg
you
ought
to
remember
that
that
older
than
you
and
this
remark
too
he
thought
rather
funny
but
apparently
he
was
alone
in
his
opinion
then
he
felt
something
against
his
calf
and
it
was
carlo
nose
carlo
was
a
large
very
shaggy
and
unkempt
northern
terrier
but
owing
to
vagueness
of
his
principal
points
due
doubtless
to
a
vagueness
in
his
immediate
ancestry
it
was
impossible
to
decide
whether
he
had
come
from
the
north
or
the
south
side
of
the
tweed
this
ageing
friend
of
edward
henry
surmising
that
something
unusual
was
afoot
in
his
house
and
having
entirely
forgotten
the
trifling
episode
of
the
bite
had
unobtrusively
come
to
make
inquiries
poor
old
boy
said
edward
henry
stooping
to
pat
the
dog
did
they
try
to
measure
his
tail
with
his
hind
leg
the
gesture
was
partly
instinctive
for
he
loved
carlo
but
it
also
had
its
origin
in
sheer
nervousness
in
sheer
ignorance
of
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
however
he
was
at
once
aware
that
he
had
done
the
worst
thing
had
not
nellie
announced
that
the
dog
must
be
got
rid
of
and
here
he
was
fondly
caressing
the
bloodthirsty
dog
with
a
hysterical
movement
of
the
lower
part
of
her
leg
nellie
pushed
violently
against
the
dog
she
did
not
kick
but
she
nearly
kicked
and
carlo
faintly
howling
a
protest
fled
edward
henry
was
hurt
he
escaped
from
between
the
beds
and
from
that
close
enervating
domestic
atmosphere
where
he
was
misunderstood
by
women
and
disdained
by
infants
he
wanted
fresh
air
he
wanted
bars
whiskies
and
the
society
of
masculine
the
whole
of
his
own
world
was
against
him
as
he
passed
by
his
knitting
mother
she
ignored
him
and
moved
not
she
had
a
great
gift
of
holding
aloof
from
conjugal
complications
on
the
landing
he
decided
that
he
would
go
out
at
once
into
the
major
world
down
the
stairs
he
saw
his
overcoat
on
the
beckoning
to
him
and
offering
release
then
he
heard
the
bedroom
door
and
his
wife
footsteps
edward
henry
well
he
stopped
and
looked
up
inimically
at
her
face
which
overhung
the
banisters
it
was
the
face
of
a
woman
outraged
in
her
most
profound
feelings
but
amazingly
determined
to
be
sweet
what
do
you
think
of
it
what
do
i
think
of
what
the
wound
yes
why
it
simply
nothing
nothing
at
all
you
know
how
that
kid
always
heals
up
quick
you
wo
be
able
to
find
the
wound
in
a
day
or
two
do
you
think
it
ought
to
be
cauterized
at
once
he
moved
on
downwards
no
i
do
i
been
bitten
three
times
in
my
life
by
dogs
and
i
was
never
cauterized
well
i
think
it
ought
to
be
cauterized
she
raised
her
voice
slightly
as
he
retreated
from
her
and
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
call
in
at
stirling
and
ask
him
to
come
round
he
made
no
reply
but
put
on
his
overcoat
and
his
hat
and
took
his
stick
glancing
up
the
stairs
he
saw
nellie
was
now
standing
at
the
head
of
them
under
the
electric
light
there
and
watching
him
he
knew
that
she
thought
he
was
cravenly
obeying
her
command
she
could
have
no
idea
that
before
she
spoke
to
him
he
had
already
decided
to
put
on
his
overcoat
and
hat
and
take
his
stick
and
go
forth
into
the
major
world
however
that
was
no
affair
of
his
he
hesitated
a
second
then
the
nurse
appeared
out
of
the
kitchen
with
a
squalling
maisie
in
her
arms
and
ran
upstairs
why
maisie
was
squalling
and
why
she
should
have
been
in
the
kitchen
at
such
an
hour
instead
of
in
bed
he
could
not
guess
but
he
could
guess
that
if
he
remained
one
second
longer
in
that
exasperating
minor
world
he
would
begin
to
smash
furniture
and
so
he
quitted
it
v
it
was
raining
slightly
but
he
dared
not
return
to
the
house
for
his
umbrella
in
the
haze
and
wet
of
the
shivering
october
night
the
clock
of
bleakridge
church
glowed
like
a
fiery
disc
suspended
in
the
sky
and
mysteriously
hanging
there
without
visible
means
of
support
it
seemed
to
him
somehow
to
symbolize
the
enigma
of
the
universe
and
intensify
his
inward
gloom
never
before
had
he
had
such
feelings
to
such
a
degree
it
is
scarcely
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
never
before
had
the
enigma
of
the
universe
occurred
to
him
the
side
gates
clicked
as
he
stood
hesitant
under
the
shelter
of
the
wall
and
a
figure
emerged
from
his
domain
it
was
bellfield
the
new
chauffeur
going
across
to
his
home
in
the
little
square
in
front
of
the
church
bellfield
touched
his
cap
with
an
eager
and
willing
hand
as
new
chauffeurs
will
want
the
car
sir
setting
in
for
a
wet
night
no
thanks
it
was
a
lie
he
did
want
the
car
he
wanted
the
car
so
that
he
might
ride
right
away
into
a
new
and
more
interesting
world
or
at
any
rate
into
hanbridge
centre
of
the
pleasures
the
wickedness
and
the
commerce
of
the
five
towns
but
he
dared
not
have
the
car
he
dared
not
have
his
own
car
he
must
slip
off
noiseless
and
unassuming
even
to
go
to
dr
stirling
he
dared
not
have
the
car
besides
he
could
have
walked
down
the
hill
to
stirling
in
three
minutes
not
that
he
had
the
least
intention
of
going
to
stirling
no
his
wife
imagined
that
he
was
going
but
she
was
mistaken
within
an
hour
when
stirling
had
failed
to
arrive
she
would
doubtless
telephone
and
get
her
stirling
not
however
with
edward
henry
assistance
he
reviewed
his
conduct
throughout
the
evening
in
what
particular
had
it
been
sinful
in
no
particular
true
the
accident
to
the
boy
was
a
misfortune
but
had
he
not
borne
that
misfortune
lightly
minimized
it
and
endeavoured
to
teach
others
to
bear
it
lightly
his
blithe
humour
ought
surely
to
have
been
an
example
to
nellie
and
as
for
the
episode
of
the
funeral
march
on
the
pianisto
really
really
the
tiresome
little
thing
ought
to
have
better
appreciated
his
whimsical
drollery
but
nellie
was
altered
he
was
altered
everything
was
altered
he
remembered
the
ecstasy
of
their
excursion
to
switzerland
he
remembered
the
rapture
with
which
on
their
honeymoon
he
had
clasped
a
new
opal
bracelet
on
her
exciting
arm
he
could
not
possibly
have
such
sensations
now
what
was
the
meaning
of
life
was
life
worth
living
the
fact
was
he
was
growing
old
useless
to
pretend
to
himself
that
it
was
not
so
both
he
and
she
were
growing
old
only
she
seemed
to
be
placidly
content
and
he
was
not
content
and
more
and
more
the
domestic
atmosphere
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
district
fretted
and
even
annoyed
him
affair
was
not
unique
but
it
was
a
culmination
he
gazed
pessimistically
north
and
south
along
the
slimy
expanse
of
trafalgar
road
which
sank
northwards
in
the
direction
of
stirling
and
southwards
in
the
direction
of
joyous
hanbridge
he
loathed
and
despised
trafalgar
road
what
was
the
use
of
making
three
hundred
and
pounds
by
a
shrewd
speculation
none
he
could
not
employ
three
hundred
and
pounds
to
increase
his
happiness
money
had
become
futile
for
him
astounding
thought
he
desired
no
more
of
it
he
had
a
considerable
income
from
investments
and
also
at
least
four
thousand
a
year
from
the
five
towns
universal
thrift
club
that
wonderful
but
unpretentious
organization
which
now
embraced
every
corner
of
the
five
towns
that
gorgeous
invention
for
profitably
taking
care
of
the
pennies
of
the
that
excellent
device
his
own
for
selling
to
the
every
kind
of
goods
at
credit
prices
after
having
received
part
of
the
money
in
advance
i
want
a
change
he
said
to
himself
and
threw
away
his
cigar
after
all
the
bitterest
thought
in
his
heart
was
perhaps
that
on
that
evening
he
had
tried
to
be
a
card
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
brilliant
career
as
a
card
had
failed
he
henry
machin
who
had
been
the
youngest
mayor
of
bursley
years
and
years
ago
he
the
recognized
amuser
of
the
five
towns
he
one
of
the
greatest
characters
that
the
five
towns
had
ever
produced
he
had
failed
of
an
effect
he
slipped
out
on
to
the
pavement
and
saw
under
the
on
the
new
hoarding
of
the
football
ground
a
poster
intimating
that
during
that
particular
week
there
was
a
gigantic
attraction
at
the
empire
music
hall
at
hanbridge
according
to
the
posters
there
was
a
gigantic
attraction
every
week
at
the
empire
but
edward
henry
happened
to
know
that
this
week
the
attraction
was
indeed
somewhat
out
of
the
common
and
was
friday
the
fashionable
night
for
the
bloods
and
the
modishness
of
the
five
towns
he
looked
at
the
church
clock
and
then
at
his
watch
he
would
be
in
time
for
the
second
house
which
started
at
nine
at
the
same
moment
an
electric
came
thundering
up
out
of
bursley
he
boarded
it
and
was
saluted
by
the
conductor
remaining
on
the
platform
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
tried
to
feel
cheerful
but
he
could
not
conquer
his
depression
yes
he
thought
what
i
want
is
change
and
a
lot
of
it
too
chapter

the

alderman

had
to
stand
at
the
back

somewhat
towards
the
side
of

part
of

auditorium
known
as
the
grand
circle

entrance
and
in
the
lounge
where
the
salutation
welcome
shone
in
electricity
over
a
large
mirror
had
compassionately
and
yet
exultingly
told
him
that
there
was
not
a
seat
left
in
the
house
he
had
shared
their
exultation
he
had
said
to
himself
full
of
honest
pride
in
the
five
towns
this
admitted
by
the
press
to
be
one
of
the
finest
in
the
provinces
holds
over
two
thousand
five
hundred
people
and
yet
we
can
fill
it
to
overflowing
twice
every
night
and
only
a
few
years
ago
there
was
a
decent
in
the
entire
district
the
word
progress
flitted
through
his
head
it
was
not
strictly
true
that
the
empire
was
or
could
be
filled
to
overflowing
twice
every
night
but
it
was
true
that
at
that
particular
moment
not
a
seat
was
unsold
and
the
aspect
of
a
crowded
auditorium
is
apt
to
give
an
optimistic
quality
to
broad
generalizations
alderman
machin
began
instinctively
to
calculate
the
amount
of
money
in
the
house
and
to
wonder
whether
there
would
be
a
chance
for
a
second
in
the
dissipated
town
of
hanbridge
he
also
wondered
why
the
idea
of
a
second
in
hanbridge
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
the
grand
circle
was
so
called
because
it
was
grand
its
plush
fauteuils
cost
a
shilling
no
mean
price
for
a
community
where
seven
pounds
of
potatoes
can
be
bought
for
sixpence
and
the
view
of
the
stage
therefrom
was
perfect
but
the
alderman
view
was
far
from
perfect
since
he
had
to
peer
as
best
he
could
between
and
above
the
shoulders
of
several
men
each
apparently
but
not
really
taller
than
himself
by
constant
slight
movements
to
comply
with
the
movements
of
the
rampart
of
shoulders
he
could
discern
fragments
of
various
advertisements
of
soap
whisky
shirts
perfume
pills
bricks
and
tea
for
the
was
down
and
curiously
he
felt
obliged
to
keep
his
eyes
on
the
and
across
the
long
intervening
vista
of
hats
and
heads
and
smoke
to
explore
its
most
difficult
corners
again
and
again
lest
when
it
went
up
he
might
not
be
in
proper
practice
for
seeing
what
was
behind
it
nevertheless
despite
the
marked
inconveniences
of
his
situation
he
felt
brighter
he
felt
almost
happy
in
this
dense
atmosphere
of
success
he
even
found
a
certain
peculiar
and
perverse
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
he
had
as
yet
been
recognized
by
nobody
once
or
twice
the
owners
of
shoulders
had
turned
and
deliberately
glared
at
the
worrying
fellow
who
had
the
impudence
to
be
all
the
time
peeping
over
them
and
between
them
they
had
not
distinguished
the
fellow
from
any
ordinary
fellow
could
they
have
known
that
he
was
the
famous
alderman
edward
henry
machin
founder
and
sole
proprietor
of
the
thrift
club
into
which
their
wives
were
probably
paying
so
much
a
week
they
would
most
assuredly
have
glared
to
another
tune
and
they
would
have
said
with
pride
afterwards
that
chap
machin
was
standing
behind
me
at
the
empire
and
though
machin
is
amongst
the
commonest
names
in
the
five
towns
all
would
have
known
that
the
great
and
admired
denry
was
meant
it
was
astonishing
that
a
personage
so
notorious
should
not
have
been
instantly
spotted
in
such
a
resort
as
the
empire
more
proof
that
the
five
towns
was
a
vast
and
seething
concentration
of
cities
and
no
longer
a
mere
district
where
everybody
knew
everybody
the
curtain
rose
and
as
it
did
so
a
thunderous
crashing
applause
of
greeting
broke
forth
applause
that
thrilled
and
impressed
and
inspired
applause
that
made
every
individual
in
the
place
feel
right
glad
that
he
was
there
for
the
curtain
had
risen
on
the
gigantic
attraction
which
many
members
of
the
audience
were
about
to
see
for
the
fifth
time
that
week
in
fact
it
was
rumoured
that
certain
men
of
fashion
whose
habit
was
to
refuse
themselves
nothing
had
attended
every
performance
of
the
gigantic
attraction
since
the
second
house
on
monday
the
scene
represented
a
restaurant
of
quiet
aspect
into
which
entered
a
waiter
bearing
a
pile
of
plates
some
two
feet
high
the
waiter
being
intoxicated
the
tower
of
plates
leaned
this
way
and
that
as
he
staggered
about
and
the
whole
house
really
did
hold
its
breath
in
the
simultaneous
hope
and
fear
of
an
enormous
and
resounding
smash
then
entered
a
second
intoxicated
waiter
also
bearing
a
pile
of
plates
some
two
feet
high
and
the
risk
of
destruction
was
thus
more
than
doubled
it
was
quadrupled
for
each
waiter
in
addition
to
the
risks
of
his
own
inebriety
was
now
subject
to
the
dreadful
peril
of
colliding
with
the
other
however
there
was
no
catastrophe
then
arrived
two
customers
one
in
a
dress
suit
and
an
eyeglass
and
the
other
in
a
large
violet
hat
a
diamond
necklace
and
a
yellow
satin
skirt
the
which
customers
seemingly
well
used
to
the
sight
of
drunken
waiters
tottering
to
and
fro
with
towers
of
plates
sat
down
at
a
table
and
waited
calmly
for
attention
the
popular
audience
with
that
quick
mental
grasp
for
which
popular
audiences
are
so
renowned
soon
perceived
that
the
table
was
in
close
proximity
to
a
lofty
sideboard
and
that
on
either
hand
of
the
sideboard
were
two
chairs
upon
which
the
two
waiters
were
trying
to
climb
in
order
to
deposit
their
plates
on
the
topmost
shelf
of
the
sideboard
the
waiters
successfully
mounted
the
chairs
and
successfully
lifted
their
towers
of
plates
to
within
half
an
inch
of
the
desired
shelf
and
then
the
chairs
began
to
show
signs
of
insecurity
by
this
time
the
audience
was
stimulated
to
an
ecstasy
of
expectation
whose
painfulness
was
only
equalled
by
its
extreme
delectability
the
sole
unmoved
persons
in
the
building
were
the
customers
awaiting
attention
at
the
restaurant
table
one
tower
was
safely
lodged
on
the
shelf
but
was
it
it
was
not
yes
no
it
curved
it
straightened
it
curved
again
the
excitement
was
as
keen
as
that
of
watching
a
drowning
man
attempt
to
reach
the
shore
it
was
simply
excruciating
it
could
not
be
borne
any
longer
and
when
it
could
not
be
borne
any
longer
the
tower
sprawled
irrevocably
and
seven
dozen
plates
fell
in
a
cascade
on
the
violet
hat
and
so
with
an
inconceivable
clatter
to
the
floor
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
being
in
the
and
the
eyeglass
becoming
aware
of
phenomena
slightly
unusual
even
in
a
restaurant
dropped
his
eyeglass
turned
round
to
the
sideboard
and
received
the
other
waiter
seven
dozen
plates
in
the
face
and
on
the
crown
of
his
head
no
such
effect
had
ever
been
seen
in
the
five
towns
and
the
felicity
of
the
audience
exceeded
all
previous
felicities
the
audience
yelled
roared
shrieked
gasped
trembled
and
punched
itself
in
a
furious
passion
of
pleasure
they
make
plates
in
the
five
towns
they
live
by
making
plates
they
understand
plates
in
the
five
towns
a
man
will
carry
not
seven
but
dozen
plates
on
a
swaying
plank
for
eight
hours
a
day
up
steps
and
down
steps
and
in
doorways
and
out
of
doorways
and
not
break
one
plate
in
seven
years
judge
therefore
the
simple
but
terrific
satisfaction
of
a
five
towns
audience
in
the
hugeness
of
the
calamity
moreover
every
plate
smashed
means
a
demand
for
a
new
plate
and
increased
prosperity
for
the
five
towns
the
grateful
crowd
in
the
auditorium
of
the
empire
would
have
covered
the
stage
with
wreaths
if
it
had
known
that
wreaths
were
used
for
other
occasions
than
funerals
which
it
did
not
know
fresh
complications
instantly
ensued
which
cruelly
cut
short
the
agreeable
exercise
of
uncontrolled
laughter
it
was
obvious
that
one
of
the
waiters
was
about
to
fall
and
in
the
enforced
tranquillity
of
a
new
dread
every
dyspeptic
person
in
the
house
was
deliciously
conscious
of
a
sudden
freedom
from
indigestion
due
to
the
agreeable
exercise
of
uncontrolled
laughter
and
wished
fervently
that
he
could
laugh
like
that
after
every
meal
the
waiter
fell
he
fell
through
the
large
violet
hat
and
disappeared
beneath
the
surface
of
a
sea
of
crockery
the
other
waiter
fell
too
but
the
sea
was
not
deep
enough
to
drown
a
couple
of
them
then
the
customers
recovering
themselves
decided
that
they
must
not
be
outclassed
in
this
competition
of
havoc
and
they
overthrew
the
table
and
everything
on
it
and
all
the
other
tables
and
everything
on
all
the
other
tables
the
audience
was
now
a
field
of
artillery
which
nothing
could
silence
the
waiters
arose
and
opening
the
sideboard
disclosed
many
hundreds
of
unsuspected
plates
of
all
kinds
ripe
for
smashing
niagaras
of
plates
surged
on
to
the
stage
all
four
performers
revelled
and
wallowed
in
smashed
plates
new
supplies
of
plates
were
constantly
being
produced
from
strange
concealments
and
finally
the
tables
and
chairs
were
broken
to
pieces
and
each
object
on
the
walls
was
torn
down
and
flung
in
bits
on
to
the
gorgeous
general
debris
to
the
top
of
which
clambered
the
violet
hat
necklace
and
yellow
petticoat
brandishing
one
single
little
plate
whose
life
had
been
miraculously
spared
shrieks
of
joy
in
that
little
plate
played
over
the
din
like
lightning
in
a
thunderstorm
and
the
curtain
fell
it
was
rung
up
fifteen
times
and
fifteen
times
the
quartette
of
artists
breathless
bowed
in
acknowledgment
of
the
frenzied
and
boisterous
testimony
to
their
unique
talents
no
singer
no
tragedian
no
comedian
no
wit
could
have
had
such
a
triumph
could
have
given
such
intense
pleasure
and
yet
none
of
the
four
had
spoken
a
word
such
is
genius
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
call
the
came
before
the
curtain
and
guaranteed
that
two
thousand
four
hundred
plates
had
been
broken
the
lights
went
up
strong
men
were
seen
to
be
wiping
tears
from
their
eyes
complete
strangers
were
seen
addressing
each
other
in
the
manner
of
old
friends
such
is
art
well
that
was
worth
a
bob
that
was
muttered
edward
henry
to
himself
and
it
was
edward
henry
had
not
escaped
the
general
fate
nobody
being
present
could
have
escaped
it
he
was
enchanted
he
had
utterly
forgotten
every
care
good
evening
machin
said
a
voice
at
his
side
not
only
he
turned
but
nearly
everyone
in
the
vicinity
turned
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
the
stout
and
splendid
managing
director
of
the
empire
and
it
sounded
with
the
ring
of
authority
above
the
rising
tinkle
of
the
bar
behind
the
grand
circle
oh
how
d
do
mr
dakins
edward
henry
held
out
a
cordial
hand
for
even
the
greatest
men
are
pleased
to
be
greeted
in
a
place
of
entertainment
by
the
managing
director
thereof
further
his
identity
was
now
recognized
have
you
seen
those
gentlemen
in
that
box
beckoning
to
you
said
dakins
proudly
deprecating
complimentary
remarks
on
the
show
which
box
dakins
hand
indicated
a
and
henry
looking
saw
three
men
one
unknown
to
him
the
second
robert
brindley
the
architect
of
bursley
and
the
third
stirling
instantly
his
conscience
leapt
up
within
him
he
thought
of
rabies
yes
sobered
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
thought
of
rabies
supposing
that
after
all
in
spite
of
long
muzzling
order
as
cited
by
his
infant
son
an
odd
case
of
rabies
should
have
lingered
in
the
british
isles
and
supposing
that
carlo
had
been
infected
not
impossible
was
it
providential
that
stirling
was
in
the
auditorium
you
know
two
of
them
said
dakins
yes
well
the
third
a
bryany
he
manager
to
mr
seven
sachs
dakins
tone
was
respectful
and
who
mr
seven
sachs
asked
edward
henry
absently
it
was
a
stupid
question
he
was
impressively
informed
that
mr
seven
sachs
was
the
american
now
nearing
the
end
of
a
provincial
tour
which
had
surpassed
all
records
of
provincial
tours
and
that
he
would
be
at
the
theatre
royal
hanbridge
next
week
edward
henry
then
remembered
that
the
hoardings
had
been
full
of
mr
seven
sachs
for
some
time
past
they
keep
on
making
signs
to
you
said
dakins
referring
to
the
occupants
of
the
edward
henry
waved
a
reply
to
the
box
here
i
take
you
there
the
shortest
way
said
dakins
ii
welcome
to
stirling
box
machin
robert
brindley
greeted
the
alderman
with
an
almost
imperceptible
wink
edward
henry
had
encountered
this
wink
once
or
twice
before
he
could
not
decide
precisely
what
it
meant
it
was
apt
to
make
him
reflective
he
did
not
dislike
robert
brindley
his
habit
was
not
to
dislike
people
he
admitted
brindley
to
be
a
clever
architect
though
he
objected
to
the
modern
style
of
the
fronts
of
his
houses
and
schools
but
he
did
take
exception
to
the
man
attitude
towards
the
five
towns
of
which
by
the
way
brindley
was
just
as
much
a
native
as
himself
brindley
seemed
to
live
in
the
five
towns
like
a
stranger
in
a
savage
land
and
to
derive
rather
too
much
sardonic
amusement
from
the
spectacle
of
existence
therein
brindley
was
a
very
special
crony
of
stirling
and
had
influenced
stirling
but
stirling
was
too
clever
to
submit
unduly
to
the
influence
besides
stirling
was
not
a
native
he
was
only
a
scotchman
and
edward
henry
considered
that
what
stirling
thought
of
the
district
did
not
matter
other
details
about
brindley
which
edward
henry
deprecated
were
his
necktie
which
for
edward
henry
taste
was
too
flowing
his
scorn
of
the
pianisto
despite
the
man
tremendous
interest
in
music
and
his
incipient
madness
on
the
subject
of
books
a
madness
shared
by
stirling
brindley
and
the
doctor
were
for
ever
chattering
about
books
and
buying
them
so
that
on
the
whole
stirling
box
was
not
a
place
where
edward
henry
felt
entirely
at
home
nevertheless
the
two
men
having
presented
bryany
did
their
best
each
in
his
own
way
to
make
him
feel
at
home
take
this
chair
machin
said
stirling
indicating
a
chair
at
the
front
oh
i
ca
take
the
front
chair
edward
henry
protested
of
course
you
can
my
dear
machin
said
brindley
sharply
the
front
chair
in
a
is
the
one
proper
seat
in
the
house
for
you
do
as
your
doctor
prescribes
and
edward
henry
accordingly
sat
down
at
the
front
with
bryany
by
his
side
and
the
other
two
sat
behind
but
edward
henry
was
not
quite
comfortable
he
faintly
resented
that
speech
of
brindley
and
yet
he
did
feel
that
what
brindley
had
said
was
true
and
he
was
indeed
glad
to
be
in
the
front
chair
of
a
brilliant
on
the
grand
tier
instead
of
being
packed
away
in
the
nethermost
twilight
of
the
grand
circle
he
wondered
how
brindley
and
stirling
had
managed
to
distinguish
his
face
among
the
confusion
of
faces
in
that
distant
obscurity
he
edward
henry
had
failed
to
notice
them
even
in
the
prominence
of
their
box
but
that
they
had
distinguished
him
showed
how
familiar
and
striking
a
figure
he
was
he
wondered
too
why
they
should
have
invited
him
to
with
them
he
was
not
of
their
set
indeed
like
many
very
eminent
men
he
was
not
to
any
degree
in
anybody
set
of
one
thing
he
was
sure
because
he
had
read
it
on
the
faces
of
all
three
of
them
namely
that
they
had
been
discussing
him
possibly
he
had
been
brought
up
for
inspection
as
a
major
lion
and
character
of
the
district
well
he
did
not
mind
that
nay
he
enjoyed
that
he
could
feel
bryany
covertly
looking
him
over
and
he
thought
look
my
boy
i
make
no
charge
he
smiled
and
nodded
to
one
or
two
people
who
with
pride
saluted
him
from
the
stalls
it
was
meet
that
he
should
be
visible
there
on
that
friday
night
a
full
house
he
observed
to
break
the
rather
awkward
silence
of
the
box
as
he
glanced
round
at
the
magnificent
pageant
of
the
aristocracy
and
the
democracy
of
the
five
towns
crowded
together
tier
above
gilded
tier
up
to
the
dim
roof
where
ragged
lads
and
maids
giggled
and
flirted
while
waiting
for
the
broken
plates
to
be
cleared
away
and
the
moving
pictures
to
begin
you
may
say
it
agreed
bryany
who
spoke
with
a
very
slight
american
accent
dakins
positively
had
a
seat
to
offer
me
i
happened
to
have
the
evening
free
it
is
often
i
do
have
a
free
evening
and
so
i
thought
i
pop
in
here
but
if
dakins
introduced
me
to
these
gentlemen
my
seat
would
have
had
to
be
a
standing
one
so
that
how
they
got
to
know
him
is
it
thought
edward
henry
and
then
there
was
another
short
silence
hear
you
been
doing
something
striking
in
rubber
shares
machin
said
brindley
at
length
astonishing
how
these
things
got
abroad
oh
very
little
very
little
edward
henry
laughed
modestly
too
late
to
do
much
in
another
fortnight
the
bottom
will
be
all
out
of
the
rubber
market
of
course
i
an
englishman
bryany
began
why
course
edward
henry
interrupted
him
hear
hear
alderman
why
course
said
brindley
approvingly
and
stirling
rich
laugh
was
heard
only
it
does
just
happen
brindley
added
that
bryany
did
us
the
honour
to
be
born
in
the
district
yes
longshaw
bryany
admitted
half
proud
and
half
apologetic
which
i
left
at
the
age
of
two
oh
longshaw
murmured
edward
henry
with
a
peculiar
inflection
longshaw
is
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
five
towns
from
bursley
and
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
bursley
have
never
been
to
longshaw
in
their
lives
have
only
heard
of
it
as
they
hear
of
chicago
or
bangkok
edward
henry
had
often
been
to
longshaw
but
like
every
visitor
from
bursley
he
instinctively
regarded
it
as
a
foolish
and
unnecessary
place
as
i
was
saying
resumed
bryany
quite
unintimidated
i
an
englishman
but
i
lived
eighteen
years
in
america
and
it
seems
to
me
the
bottom
will
soon
be
knocked
out
of
pretty
nearly
all
the
markets
in
england
look
at
the
five
towns
no
do
mr
bryany
said
brindley
do
go
to
extremes
personally
i
do
mind
looking
at
the
five
towns
said
edward
henry
what
of
it
well
did
you
ever
see
such
people
for
looking
twice
at
a
note
edward
henry
most
certainly
did
not
like
this
aspersion
on
his
native
district
he
gazed
in
silence
at
bryany
brassy
and
yet
simple
face
and
did
not
like
the
face
either
and
bryany
beautifully
unaware
that
he
had
failed
in
tact
continued
the
five
towns
is
the
most
english
place
i
ever
seen
believe
me
of
course
it
has
its
good
points
and
england
has
her
good
points
but
there
no
money
stirring
there
no
field
for
speculation
on
the
spot
and
as
for
outside
investment
no
englishman
will
touch
anything
that
really
is
good
he
emphasized
the
last
three
words
what
d
do
yeself
mr
bryany
inquired
dr
stirling
what
do
i
do
with
my
little
bit
cried
bryany
oh
i
know
what
to
do
with
my
little
bit
i
can
get
ten
per
cent
in
seattle
and
twelve
to
fifteen
in
calgary
on
my
little
bit
and
security
just
as
good
as
english
railway
stock
better
the
theatre
was
darkened
and
the
cinematograph
began
its
restless
twinkling
bryany
went
on
offering
to
edward
henry
in
a
suitably
lowered
voice
his
views
on
the
great
questions
of
investment
and
speculation
and
edward
henry
made
cautious
replies
and
even
when
there
a
good
thing
going
at
home
bryany
said
in
a
wounded
tone
what
englishman
look
at
it
i
would
said
edward
henry
with
a
blandness
that
was
only
for
all
the
time
he
was
cogitating
the
question
whether
the
presence
of
dr
stirling
in
the
audience
ought
or
ought
not
to
be
regarded
as
providential
now
i
got
the
option
on
a
little
affair
in
london
said
bryany
while
edward
henry
glanced
quickly
at
him
in
the
darkness
and
can
i
get
anybody
to
go
into
it
i
ca
what
sort
of
a
little
affair
building
a
theatre
in
the
west
end
even
a
less
impassive
man
than
edward
henry
would
have
started
at
the
coincidence
of
this
remark
and
edward
henry
started
twenty
minutes
ago
he
had
been
idly
dreaming
of
theatrical
speculation
and
now
he
could
almost
see
theatrical
speculation
shimmering
before
him
in
the
pale
shifting
rays
of
the
cinematograph
that
cut
through
the
gloom
of
the
mysterious
auditorium
oh
and
in
this
new
interest
he
forgot
the
enigma
of
the
ways
of
providence
of
course
you
know
i
in
the
business
said
bryany
seven
sachs
manager
it
was
as
if
he
owned
and
operated
mr
seven
sachs
so
i
heard
said
edward
henry
and
then
remarked
with
mischievous
cordiality
and
i
suppose
these
chaps
told
you
i
was
the
sort
of
man
you
were
after
and
you
got
them
to
ask
me
in
eh
mr
bryany
bryany
gave
an
uneasy
laugh
but
seemed
to
find
naught
to
say
well
what
your
little
affair
edward
henry
encouraged
him
oh
i
ca
tell
you
now
said
bryany
it
would
take
too
long
the
thing
has
to
be
explained
well
what
about
i
have
to
leave
for
london
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
well
some
other
time
after
will
be
too
late
well
what
about
the
fact
is
i
half
promised
to
go
with
dr
stirling
to
some
club
or
other
after
the
show
otherwise
we
might
have
had
a
quiet
confidential
chat
in
my
rooms
over
at
the
turk
head
i
never
dreamt
bryany
was
now
as
melancholy
as
a
greedy
lad
who
regards
rich
fruit
at
arm
length
through
a
window
and
he
had
ceased
to
be
patronizing
i
soon
get
rid
of
stirling
for
you
said
edward
henry
turning
instantly
towards
the
doctor
the
ways
of
providence
had
been
made
plain
to
edward
henry
i
say
doc
but
the
doctor
and
brindley
were
in
conversation
with
another
man
at
the
open
door
of
the
box
what
is
it
said
stirling
i
come
to
fetch
you
you
wanted
at
my
place
well
you
a
caution
said
stirling
why
am
i
a
caution
edward
henry
smoothly
protested
i
did
tell
you
before
because
i
did
want
to
spoil
your
fun
stirling
mien
was
not
happy
did
they
tell
you
i
was
here
he
asked
you
almost
think
so
would
you
said
edward
henry
in
a
playful
enigmatic
tone
after
all
he
decided
privately
his
wife
was
right
it
was
better
that
stirling
should
see
the
infant
and
there
was
also
this
natural
human
thought
in
his
mind
he
objected
to
the
doctor
giving
an
entire
evening
to
diversions
away
from
home
he
considered
that
a
doctor
when
not
on
a
round
of
visits
ought
to
be
for
ever
in
his
ready
for
a
sudden
call
of
emergency
it
was
monstrous
that
stirling
should
have
proposed
after
an
escapade
at
the
to
spend
further
hours
with
chance
acquaintances
in
vague
clubs
half
the
town
might
fall
sick
and
die
while
the
doctor
was
vainly
amusing
himself
thus
the
righteous
in
edward
henry
what
the
matter
asked
stirling
my
eldest
been
rather
badly
bitten
by
a
dog
and
the
missis
wants
it
cauterized
really
well
you
bet
she
does
where
the
bite
in
the
calf
the
other
man
at
the
door
having
departed
robert
brindley
abruptly
joined
the
conversation
at
this
point
i
suppose
you
heard
of
that
case
of
hydrophobia
at
bleakridge
said
brindley
edward
henry
heart
jumped
no
i
have
he
said
anxiously
what
is
it
he
gazed
at
the
white
blur
of
brindley
face
in
the
darkened
box
and
he
could
hear
the
rapid
clicking
of
the
cinematograph
behind
him
did
you
see
it
in
the
no
neither
did
i
said
brindley
at
the
same
moment
the
moving
pictures
came
to
an
end
the
theatre
was
filled
with
light
and
the
band
began
to
play
god
save
the
king
brindley
and
stirling
were
laughing
and
indeed
brindley
had
scored
this
time
over
the
unparalleled
card
of
the
five
towns
i
make
you
a
present
of
that
said
edward
henry
but
my
wife
most
precious
infant
has
to
be
cauterized
doctor
he
added
firmly
got
your
car
here
stirling
questioned
no
have
you
no
well
there
the
tram
i
follow
you
later
i
some
business
round
this
way
persuade
my
wife
not
to
worry
will
you
and
when
a
discontented
stirling
had
made
his
excuses
and
adieux
to
bryany
and
robert
brindley
had
decided
that
he
could
not
leave
his
crony
to
travel
by
alone
and
the
two
men
had
gone
then
edward
henry
turned
to
bryany
that
how
i
get
rid
of
the
doctor
you
see
but
your
child
been
bitten
by
a
dog
asked
bryany
acutely
perplexed
you
almost
think
so
would
you
edward
henry
replied
carefully
what
price
going
to
the
turk
head
now
he
remembered
with
satisfaction
and
yet
with
misgiving
a
remark
made
to
him
a
judgment
passed
on
him
by
a
very
old
woman
very
many
years
before
this
discerning
hag
the
widow
hullins
by
name
had
said
to
him
briefly
well
you
a
queer
iii
within
five
minutes
he
was
following
bryany
into
a
small
parlour
on
the
first
floor
of
the
turk
head
a
room
with
which
he
had
no
previous
acquaintance
though
like
most
industrious
men
of
affairs
in
metropolitan
hanbridge
he
reckoned
to
know
something
about
the
head
bryany
turned
up
the
gas
the
turk
head
took
pride
in
being
a
hostelry
and
while
it
had
accustomed
itself
to
incandescent
mantles
on
the
ground
floor
it
had
not
yet
conquered
a
natural
distaste
for
electricity
and
edward
henry
saw
a
smart
a
a
and
other
necessaries
of
theatrical
business
life
at
large
in
the
apartment
i
never
seen
this
room
before
said
edward
henry
take
your
overcoat
off
and
sit
down
will
you
said
bryany
as
he
turned
to
replenish
the
fire
from
a
bucket
it
my
private
whenever
i
am
on
my
travels
i
always
take
a
private
it
pays
you
know
of
course
i
mean
if
i
alone
when
i
looking
after
sachs
of
course
we
share
a
edward
henry
agreed
lightly
i
suppose
so
but
the
fact
was
that
he
was
much
impressed
he
himself
had
never
taken
a
private
in
any
hotel
he
had
sometimes
felt
the
desire
but
he
had
not
had
the
face
as
they
say
down
there
to
do
it
to
take
a
private
in
a
hotel
was
generally
regarded
in
the
five
towns
as
the
very
summit
of
dashing
expensiveness
and
futile
luxury
i
did
know
they
had
any
private
in
this
shanty
said
edward
henry
bryany
having
finished
with
the
fire
fronted
him
shovel
in
hand
with
a
remarkable
air
of
consummate
wisdom
and
replied
you
can
generally
get
what
you
want
if
you
insist
on
having
it
even
in
this
edward
henry
regretted
his
use
of
the
word
shanty
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
may
allow
themselves
to
twit
the
historic
and
excellent
turk
head
but
they
do
not
extend
the
privilege
to
strangers
and
in
justice
to
the
turk
head
it
is
to
be
clearly
stated
that
it
did
no
more
to
cow
and
discourage
travellers
than
any
other
provincial
hotel
in
england
it
was
a
sound
and
serious
english
provincial
hotel
and
it
linked
century
to
century
said
bryany
the
place
for
hotels
yes
i
expect
it
is
been
to
chicago
no
i
have
bryany
as
he
removed
his
overcoat
could
be
seen
politely
forbearing
to
raise
his
eyebrows
of
course
you
been
to
new
york
edward
henry
would
have
given
all
he
had
in
his
pockets
to
be
able
to
say
that
he
had
been
to
new
york
but
by
some
inexplicable
negligence
he
had
hitherto
omitted
to
go
to
new
york
and
being
a
truthful
person
except
in
the
gravest
crises
he
was
obliged
to
answer
miserably
no
i
have
bryany
gazed
at
him
with
amazement
and
compassion
apparently
staggered
by
the
discovery
that
there
existed
in
england
a
man
of
the
world
who
had
contrived
to
struggle
on
for
forty
years
without
perfecting
his
education
by
a
visit
to
new
york
edward
henry
could
not
tolerate
bryany
look
it
was
a
look
which
he
had
never
been
able
to
tolerate
on
the
features
of
anybody
whatsoever
he
reminded
himself
that
his
secret
object
in
accompanying
bryany
to
the
turk
head
was
to
repay
bryany
in
what
coin
he
knew
not
yet
for
the
aspersions
which
at
the
he
had
cast
upon
england
in
general
and
upon
the
five
towns
in
particular
and
also
to
get
revenge
for
having
been
tricked
into
believing
even
for
a
moment
that
there
was
really
a
case
of
hydrophobia
at
bleakridge
it
is
true
that
bryany
was
innocent
of
this
deception
which
had
been
accomplished
by
robert
brindley
but
that
was
a
detail
which
did
not
trouble
edward
henry
who
lumped
his
grievances
together
for
convenience
he
had
been
reflecting
that
some
sentimental
people
unused
to
the
ways
of
paternal
affection
in
the
five
towns
might
consider
him
a
rather
callous
father
he
had
been
reflecting
again
that
suggestion
of
might
not
be
as
entirely
foolish
as
feminine
suggestions
in
such
circumstances
too
often
are
but
now
he
put
these
thoughts
away
reassuring
himself
against
hydrophobia
anyhow
by
the
recollection
of
the
definite
statement
of
the
moreover
had
he
not
inspected
the
wound
as
healthy
a
wound
as
you
could
wish
for
and
he
said
in
a
new
tone
very
curtly
now
bryany
what
about
this
little
affair
of
yours
he
saw
that
bryany
accepted
the
implied
rebuke
with
the
deference
properly
shown
by
a
man
who
needs
something
towards
the
man
in
possession
of
what
he
needs
and
studying
the
fellow
countenance
he
decided
that
despite
its
brassiness
and
simple
cunning
it
was
scarcely
the
countenance
of
a
rascal
well
it
like
this
said
bryany
sitting
down
opposite
edward
henry
at
the
centre
table
and
reaching
with
obsequious
liveliness
for
the
he
drew
from
the
which
was
lettered
first
a
flask
of
whisky
with
a
patent
stopper
and
then
a
spacious
box
of
cigarettes
i
always
travel
with
the
right
sort
he
remarked
holding
the
golden
liquid
up
to
the
light
it
safer
and
it
saves
any
trouble
with
orders
after
these
english
hotels
you
know
so
saying
he
dispensed
whisky
and
cigarettes
there
being
a
siphon
and
glasses
and
three
matches
in
a
on
the
table
here
looking
he
said
with
raised
glass
and
edward
henry
responded
in
conformity
with
the
changeless
ritual
of
the
five
towns
i
looks
and
they
sipped
whereupon
bryany
next
drew
from
the
a
piece
of
transparent
paper
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
plan
of
piccadilly
circus
and
environs
said
he
now
there
is
a
piccadilly
in
hanbridge
also
a
pall
mall
and
a
chancery
lane
the
adjective
metropolitan
applied
to
hanbridge
is
just
london
questioned
edward
henry
i
understood
london
when
we
were
chatting
over
there
with
his
elbow
he
indicated
the
somewhere
vaguely
outside
the
room
london
said
bryany
and
edward
henry
thought
what
on
earth
am
i
meddling
with
london
for
what
use
should
i
be
in
london
you
see
the
plot
marked
in
red
bryany
proceeded
well
the
site
there
an
old
chapel
on
it
now
what
do
all
these
straight
lines
mean
edward
henry
inquired
examining
the
plan
lines
radiated
from
the
red
plot
in
various
directions
those
are
the
lines
of
vision
said
bryany
they
show
just
where
an
electric
sign
at
the
corner
of
the
front
of
the
proposed
theatre
could
be
seen
from
you
notice
the
site
is
not
in
the
circus
itself
a
shade
to
the
north
bryany
finger
approached
edward
henry
on
the
plan
and
the
clouds
from
their
cigarettes
fraternally
mingled
now
you
see
by
those
lines
that
the
electric
sign
of
the
proposed
theatre
would
be
visible
from
nearly
the
whole
of
piccadilly
circus
parts
of
lower
regent
street
coventry
street
and
even
shaftesbury
avenue
you
see
what
a
site
it
is
absolutely
unique
edward
henry
asked
coldly
have
you
bought
it
no
bryany
seemed
to
apologize
i
have
exactly
bought
it
but
i
got
an
option
on
it
the
magic
word
option
wakened
the
drowsy
speculator
in
edward
henry
and
the
mere
act
of
looking
at
the
plan
endowed
the
plot
of
land
with
reality
there
it
was
it
existed
an
option
to
buy
it
you
ca
buy
land
in
the
west
end
of
london
said
bryany
sagely
you
can
only
lease
it
well
of
course
edward
henry
concurred
the
freehold
belongs
to
lord
woldo
now
aged
six
months
really
murmured
edward
henry
i
got
an
option
to
take
up
the
remainder
of
the
lease
with
years
to
run
on
the
condition
i
put
up
a
theatre
and
the
option
expires
in
exactly
a
fortnight
time
edward
henry
frowned
and
then
asked
what
are
the
figures
that
is
to
say
bryany
corrected
himself
smiling
courteously
i
got
half
the
option
and
who
got
the
other
half
rose
euclid
got
the
other
half
at
the
mention
of
the
name
of
one
of
the
most
renowned
in
england
edward
henry
excusably
started
not
he
exclaimed
bryany
nodded
proudly
blowing
out
much
smoke
tell
me
asked
edward
henry
confidentially
leaning
forward
where
do
those
ladies
get
their
names
from
it
happens
in
this
case
to
be
her
real
name
said
bryany
her
father
kept
a
tobacconist
shop
in
cheapside
the
sign
was
kept
up
for
many
years
until
rose
paid
to
have
it
changed
well
well
breathed
edward
henry
secretly
thrilled
by
these
extraordinary
revelations
and
so
you
and
she
have
got
it
between
you
bryany
said
i
bought
half
of
it
from
her
some
time
ago
she
was
badly
hard
up
for
a
hundred
pounds
and
i
let
her
have
the
money
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
with
a
free
gesture
that
seemed
to
imply
that
he
was
capable
of
parting
with
a
hundred
pounds
just
as
easily
how
did
she
the
option
edward
henry
inquired
putting
into
the
query
all
the
innuendo
of
a
man
accustomed
to
look
at
great
worldly
affairs
from
the
inside
how
did
she
get
it
she
got
it
from
the
late
lord
woldo
she
was
always
very
friendly
with
the
late
lord
woldo
you
know
edward
henry
nodded
why
she
and
the
countess
of
chell
are
as
thick
as
thieves
you
know
something
about
the
countess
down
here
i
reckon
the
countess
of
chell
was
the
wife
of
the
supreme
local
magnate
edward
henry
answered
calmly
we
do
he
was
tempted
to
relate
a
unique
adventure
of
his
youth
when
he
had
driven
the
countess
to
a
public
meeting
in
his
but
sheer
pride
kept
him
silent
i
asked
you
for
the
figures
he
added
in
a
manner
which
requested
bryany
to
remember
that
he
was
the
founder
chairman
and
proprietor
of
the
five
towns
universal
thrift
club
one
of
the
most
successful
business
organizations
in
the
midlands
here
they
are
said
bryany
passing
across
the
table
a
sheet
of
paper
and
as
edward
henry
studied
them
he
could
hear
bryany
faintly
cooing
into
his
ear
of
course
rose
got
the
reduced
and
when
i
tell
you
that
the
demand
for
theatres
in
the
west
end
far
exceeds
the
supply
and
that
theatre
rents
are
always
going
up
when
i
tell
you
that
a
theatre
costing
to
build
can
be
let
for
a
year
and
often
a
week
on
a
short
term
and
he
could
hear
the
gas
singing
over
his
head
and
also
unhappily
he
could
hear
stirling
talking
to
his
wife
and
saying
to
her
that
the
bite
was
far
more
serious
than
it
looked
and
nellie
hoping
very
audibly
that
nothing
had
happened
to
him
her
still
absent
husband
and
then
he
could
hear
bryany
again
when
i
tell
you
when
you
tell
me
all
this
bryany
he
interrupted
with
that
ferocity
which
in
the
five
towns
is
regarded
as
mere
directness
i
wonder
why
the
devil
you
want
to
sell
your
half
of
the
option
if
you
want
to
sell
it
do
you
want
to
sell
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
bryany
as
if
up
to
that
moment
he
had
told
naught
but
lies
i
do
why
oh
i
always
travelling
about
you
see
england
one
day
america
the
next
apparently
he
had
quickly
abandoned
the
strictness
of
veracity
all
depends
on
the
governor
movements
i
could
keep
a
proper
eye
on
an
affair
of
that
kind
edward
henry
laughed
and
could
i
chance
for
you
to
go
a
bit
oftener
to
london
said
bryany
laughing
too
then
with
extreme
and
convincing
seriousness
the
very
man
for
a
thing
of
that
kind
and
you
know
it
edward
henry
was
not
displeased
by
this
flattery
how
much
how
much
well
i
told
you
frankly
what
i
paid
i
made
no
concealment
of
that
did
i
now
well
i
want
what
i
paid
it
worth
it
got
a
copy
of
the
option
i
hope
bryany
produced
a
copy
of
the
option
i
am
nothing
but
an
infernal
ass
to
mix
myself
up
in
a
mad
scheme
like
this
said
edward
henry
to
his
soul
perusing
the
documents
it
right
off
my
line
right
bang
off
it
but
what
a
lark
but
even
to
his
soul
he
did
not
utter
the
remainder
of
the
truth
about
himself
namely
i
should
like
to
cut
a
dash
before
this
insufferable
patronizer
of
england
and
the
five
towns
suddenly
something
snapped
within
him
and
he
said
to
bryany
i
on
those
words
and
no
more
you
are
bryany
exclaimed
mistrusting
his
ears
edward
henry
nodded
well
that
business
anyway
said
bryany
taking
a
fresh
cigarette
and
lighting
it
it
how
we
do
business
down
here
said
edward
henry
quite
inaccurately
for
it
was
not
in
the
least
how
they
did
business
down
there
bryany
asked
with
a
rather
obvious
anxiety
but
when
can
you
pay
oh
i
send
you
a
cheque
in
a
day
or
two
and
edward
henry
in
his
turn
took
a
fresh
cigarette
that
wo
do
that
wo
do
cried
bryany
i
absolutely
must
have
the
money
morning
in
london
i
can
sell
the
option
in
london
for
eighty
pounds
i
know
that
you
must
have
it
must
they
exchanged
glances
and
edward
henry
rapidly
acquiring
new
knowledge
of
human
nature
on
the
threshold
of
a
world
strange
to
him
understood
that
bryany
with
his
private
and
his
investments
in
seattle
and
calgary
was
at
his
wits
end
for
a
bag
of
english
sovereigns
and
had
trusted
to
some
chance
encounter
to
save
him
from
a
calamity
and
his
contempt
for
bryany
was
that
of
a
man
to
whom
his
bankers
are
positively
servile
here
bryany
almost
shouted
do
light
your
cigarette
with
my
option
i
beg
pardon
edward
henry
apologized
dropping
the
document
which
he
had
creased
into
a
spill
there
were
no
matches
left
on
the
table
i
find
you
a
match
it
of
no
consequence
said
edward
henry
feeling
in
his
pockets
having
discovered
therein
a
piece
of
paper
he
twisted
it
and
rose
to
put
it
to
the
gas
could
you
slip
round
to
your
bank
and
meet
me
at
the
station
in
the
morning
with
the
cash
suggested
bryany
no
i
could
said
edward
henry
well
then
what
here
you
better
take
this
the
card
reborn
soothed
his
host
and
blowing
out
the
spill
which
he
had
just
ignited
at
the
gas
he
offered
it
to
bryany
what
this
man
bryany
observing
the
peculiarity
of
the
spill
seized
it
and
unrolled
it
not
without
a
certain
agitation
he
stammered
do
you
mean
to
say
it
genuine
you
almost
think
so
would
you
said
edward
henry
he
was
growing
fond
of
this
reply
and
of
the
enigmatic
playful
tone
that
he
had
invented
for
it
but
we
may
as
you
say
look
twice
at
a
fiver
continued
edward
henry
but
we
apt
to
be
careless
about
notes
in
this
district
i
daresay
that
why
i
always
carry
one
but
it
burnt
only
just
the
edge
not
enough
to
harm
it
if
any
bank
in
england
refuses
it
return
it
to
me
and
i
give
you
a
couple
more
in
exchange
is
that
talking
well
i
dashed
bryany
attempted
to
rise
and
then
subsided
back
into
his
chair
i
am
simply
and
totally
dashed
he
smiled
weakly
hysterically
and
in
that
instant
edward
henry
felt
all
the
sweetness
of
a
complete
and
luscious
revenge
he
said
commandingly
you
must
sign
me
a
transfer
i
dictate
it
then
he
jumped
up
you
in
a
hurry
i
am
my
wife
is
expecting
me
you
promised
to
find
me
a
match
edward
henry
waved
the
unlit
cigarette
as
a
reproach
to
imperfect
hospitality
iv
the
clock
of
bleakridge
church
still
imperturbably
shining
in
the
night
showed
a
quarter
to
one
when
he
saw
it
again
on
his
hurried
and
guilty
way
home
the
pavements
were
drying
in
the
fresh
night
wind
and
he
had
his
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
the
neck
he
was
absolutely
solitary
in
the
long
muddy
perspective
of
trafalgar
road
he
walked
because
the
last
was
already
housed
in
its
shed
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
and
he
walked
quickly
because
his
conscience
drove
him
onwards
and
yet
he
dreaded
to
arrive
lest
a
wound
in
the
leg
should
have
maliciously
decided
to
fester
in
order
to
put
him
in
the
wrong
he
was
now
as
apprehensive
concerning
that
wound
as
nellie
herself
had
been
at
but
in
his
mind
above
the
dark
gulf
of
anxiety
there
floated
brighter
thoughts
despite
his
fears
and
his
remorse
as
a
father
he
laughed
aloud
in
the
deserted
street
when
he
remembered
visage
of
astonishment
upon
uncreasing
the
note
indubitably
he
had
made
a
terrific
and
everlasting
impression
upon
bryany
he
was
sending
bryany
out
of
the
five
towns
a
different
man
he
had
taught
bryany
a
thing
or
two
to
what
brilliant
use
had
he
turned
the
purely
accidental
possession
of
a
note
one
of
his
finest
inspirations
an
inspiration
worthy
of
the
great
days
of
his
youth
yes
he
had
had
his
hour
that
evening
and
it
had
been
a
glorious
one
also
it
had
cost
him
a
hundred
pounds
and
he
did
not
care
he
would
retire
to
bed
with
a
net
gain
of
two
hundred
and
pounds
instead
of
three
hundred
and
pounds
that
was
all
for
he
did
not
mean
to
take
up
the
option
the
ecstasy
was
cooled
now
and
he
saw
clearly
that
london
and
theatrical
enterprises
therein
would
not
be
suited
to
his
genius
in
the
five
towns
he
was
on
his
own
ground
he
was
a
figure
he
was
sure
of
himself
in
london
he
would
be
a
provincial
with
the
diffidence
and
the
uncertainty
of
a
provincial
nevertheless
london
seemed
to
be
summoning
him
from
afar
off
and
he
dreamt
agreeably
of
london
as
one
dreams
of
the
impossible
east
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
gate
in
the
wall
of
his
property
he
saw
that
the
was
illuminated
and
all
the
other
front
rooms
in
darkness
either
his
wife
or
his
mother
then
was
sitting
up
in
the
he
inserted
a
cautious
into
the
door
and
entered
the
silent
home
like
a
sinner
the
dim
light
in
the
hall
gravely
reproached
him
all
his
movements
were
modest
and
restrained
no
noisy
rattling
of
his
stick
now
the
door
was
slightly
ajar
he
hesitated
and
then
nerving
himself
pushed
against
it
nellie
with
lowered
head
was
seated
at
a
table
mending
the
image
of
tranquillity
and
soft
resignation
a
pile
of
children
garments
lay
by
her
side
but
the
article
in
her
busy
hands
appeared
to
be
an
of
his
own
none
but
she
ever
reinforced
the
buttons
on
his
linen
such
was
her
wifely
rule
and
he
considered
that
there
was
no
sense
in
it
she
was
working
by
the
light
of
a
single
lamp
on
the
table
the
splendid
chandelier
being
out
of
action
her
economy
in
the
use
of
electricity
was
incurable
and
he
considered
that
there
was
no
sense
in
that
either
she
glanced
up
with
a
guarded
expression
that
might
have
meant
anything
he
said
are
you
trying
your
eyes
and
she
replied
oh
no
then
plunging
he
came
to
the
point
well
doctor
been
she
nodded
what
does
he
say
it
quite
all
right
he
did
nothing
but
cover
up
the
place
with
a
bit
of
cyanide
gauze
instantly
in
his
own
esteem
he
regained
perfection
as
a
father
of
course
the
bite
was
nothing
had
he
not
said
so
from
the
first
had
he
not
been
quite
sure
throughout
that
the
bite
was
nothing
then
why
did
you
sit
up
he
asked
and
there
was
a
faint
righteous
challenge
in
his
tone
i
was
anxious
about
you
i
was
afraid
did
stirling
tell
you
i
had
some
business
i
forget
i
told
him
to
anyhow
important
business
it
must
have
been
said
nellie
in
an
inscrutable
voice
she
rose
and
gathered
together
her
paraphernalia
and
he
saw
that
she
was
wearing
the
damnable
white
apron
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
home
enveloped
and
stifled
him
once
more
how
different
was
this
exasperating
interior
from
the
large
jolly
freedom
of
the
empire
music
hall
and
from
the
whisky
cigarettes
and
masculinity
of
that
private
room
at
the
turk
head
it
was
he
repeated
grimly
and
resentfully
very
important
and
i
tell
you
another
thing
i
shall
probably
have
to
go
to
london
he
said
this
just
to
startle
her
it
will
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
she
replied
angelically
but
unstartled
it
just
what
you
need
and
she
gazed
at
him
as
though
his
welfare
and
felicity
were
her
sole
preoccupation
i
meant
i
might
have
to
stop
there
quite
a
while
he
insisted
if
you
ask
me
she
said
i
think
it
would
do
us
all
good
so
saying
she
retired
having
expressed
no
curiosity
whatever
as
to
the
nature
of
the
very
important
business
in
london
for
a
moment
left
alone
he
was
at
a
loss
then
snorting
he
went
to
the
table
and
extinguished
the
lamp
he
was
now
in
darkness
the
light
in
the
hall
showed
him
the
position
of
the
door
he
snorted
again
oh
very
well
then
he
muttered
if
that
it
i
hanged
if
i
do
go
to
london
i
hanged
if
i
do
go
to
london
chapter
iii
i
the
early
adventures
of
alderman
machin
of
bursley
at
wilkins
hotel
london
were
so
singular
and
to
him
so
refreshing
that
they
must
be
recounted
in
some
detail
he
went
to
london
by
the
morning
express
from
knype
on
the
monday
week
after
his
visit
to
the
in
the
meantime
he
had
had
some
correspondence
with
bryany
more
poetic
than
precise
about
the
option
and
had
informed
bryany
that
he
would
arrive
in
london
several
days
before
the
option
expired
but
he
had
not
given
a
definite
date
the
whole
affair
indeed
was
amusingly
vague
and
despite
his
assurances
to
his
wife
that
the
matter
was
momentous
he
did
not
regard
his
trip
to
london
as
a
business
trip
at
all
but
rather
as
a
simple
freakish
change
of
air
the
one
certain
item
in
the
whole
situation
was
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
a
quite
considerable
sum
of
actual
money
destined
he
hoped
but
was
not
sure
to
take
up
the
option
at
the
proper
hour
nellie
impeccable
to
the
last
accompanied
him
in
the
motor
to
knype
the
station
the
drive
superficially
pleasant
was
in
reality
very
disconcerting
to
him
for
nine
days
the
household
had
talked
in
apparent
cheerfulness
of
father
visit
to
london
as
though
it
were
an
occasion
for
joy
on
father
behalf
tempered
by
affectionate
sorrow
for
his
absence
the
official
theory
was
that
all
was
for
the
best
in
the
best
of
all
possible
homes
and
this
theory
was
admirably
maintained
and
yet
everybody
knew
even
to
maisie
that
it
was
not
so
everybody
knew
that
the
master
and
the
mistress
of
the
home
calm
and
sweet
as
was
their
demeanour
were
contending
in
a
terrific
silent
and
mysterious
altercation
which
in
some
way
was
connected
with
the
visit
to
london
so
far
as
edward
henry
was
concerned
he
had
been
hoping
for
some
decisive
event
a
tone
gesture
glance
pressure
during
the
drive
to
knype
which
offered
the
last
chance
of
a
real
concord
no
such
event
occurred
they
conversed
with
the
same
false
cordiality
as
had
marked
their
relations
since
the
evening
of
the
on
that
evening
nellie
had
suddenly
transformed
herself
into
a
distressingly
perfect
angel
and
not
once
had
she
descended
from
her
high
estate
at
least
daily
she
had
kissed
him
what
kisses
kisses
that
were
not
kisses
tasteless
mockeries
like
ale
he
could
have
killed
her
but
he
could
not
put
a
finger
on
a
fault
in
her
marvellous
wifely
behaviour
she
would
have
died
victorious
so
that
his
freakish
excursion
was
not
starting
very
auspiciously
and
waiting
with
her
for
the
train
on
the
platform
at
knype
he
felt
this
more
and
more
his
old
clerk
penkethman
was
there
to
receive
certain
final
instructions
on
thrift
club
matters
and
the
sweetness
of
nellie
attitude
towards
the
ancient
man
and
the
ancient
naïve
pleasure
therein
positively
maddened
edward
henry
to
such
an
extent
that
he
began
to
think
is
she
going
to
spoil
my
trip
for
me
then
brindley
came
up
brindley
too
was
going
to
london
and
nellie
saccharine
assurances
to
brindley
that
edward
henry
really
needed
a
change
just
about
completed
edward
henry
desperation
not
even
the
uproarious
advent
of
two
jolly
wholesale
grocers
messieurs
garvin
quorrall
also
going
to
london
could
effectually
lighten
his
pessimism
when
the
train
steamed
in
edward
henry
in
fear
postponed
the
ultimate
kiss
as
long
as
possible
he
allowed
brindley
to
climb
before
him
into
the
compartment
and
purposely
tarried
in
finding
change
for
the
porter
and
then
he
turned
to
nellie
and
stooped
she
raised
her
white
veil
and
raised
the
angelic
face
they
kissed
the
same
false
kiss
and
she
was
withdrawing
her
lips
but
suddenly
she
put
them
again
to
his
for
one
second
with
a
hysterical
clinging
pressure
it
was
nothing
nobody
could
have
noticed
it
she
herself
pretended
that
she
had
not
done
it
edward
henry
had
to
pretend
not
to
notice
it
but
to
him
it
was
everything
she
had
relented
she
had
surrendered
the
sign
had
come
from
her
she
wished
him
to
enjoy
his
visit
to
london
he
said
to
himself
dashed
if
i
do
write
to
her
every
day
he
leaned
out
of
the
window
as
the
train
rolled
away
and
waved
and
smiled
to
her
not
concealing
his
sentiments
now
nor
did
she
conceal
hers
as
she
replied
with
exquisite
pantomime
to
his
signals
but
if
the
train
had
not
been
rapidly
and
infallibly
separating
them
the
reconciliation
could
scarcely
have
been
thus
open
if
for
some
reason
the
train
had
backed
into
the
station
and
ejected
its
passengers
those
two
would
have
covered
up
their
feelings
again
in
an
instant
such
is
human
nature
in
the
five
towns
when
edward
henry
withdrew
his
head
into
the
compartment
brindley
and
garvin
the
latter
standing
at
the
corridor
door
observed
that
his
spirits
had
shot
up
in
the
most
astonishing
manner
and
in
their
blindness
they
attributed
the
phenomenon
to
edward
henry
delight
in
a
temporary
freedom
from
domesticity
garvin
had
come
from
the
neighbouring
compartment
which
was
to
suggest
a
game
at
bridge
messieurs
garvin
quorrall
journeyed
to
london
once
a
week
and
sometimes
oftener
and
being
traders
they
had
special
they
travelled
because
their
special
were
brindley
said
that
he
did
mind
a
game
but
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
paying
excess
fare
for
the
privilege
garvin
told
him
to
come
along
and
trust
in
messieurs
garvin
quorrall
edward
henry
not
nowadays
an
enthusiastic
enthusiastically
agreed
to
join
the
hand
and
announced
that
he
did
not
care
if
he
paid
forty
excess
fares
whereupon
robert
brindley
grumbled
enviously
that
it
was
all
very
well
for
millionaires
they
followed
garvin
into
the
compartment
and
it
soon
appeared
that
messrs
garvin
quorrall
did
in
fact
own
the
train
and
that
the
london
and
north
western
railway
was
no
more
than
their
washpot
bring
us
a
cushion
from
somewhere
will
ye
said
quorrall
casually
to
a
who
entered
and
the
resplendent
official
obeyed
the
long
cushion
rapt
from
another
compartment
was
placed
on
the
knees
of
the
quartette
and
the
game
began
the
examined
the
tickets
of
brindley
and
edward
henry
and
somehow
failed
to
notice
that
they
were
of
the
wrong
colour
and
at
this
proof
of
their
influential
greatness
messieurs
garvin
quorrall
were
both
secretly
proud
the
last
rubber
finished
in
the
neighbourhood
of
willesden
and
edward
henry
having
won
eighteenpence
halfpenny
was
exuberantly
content
for
messrs
garvin
quorrall
and
brindley
were
all
renowned
the
cushion
was
thrown
away
and
a
fitful
conversation
occupied
the
few
remaining
minutes
of
the
journey
where
do
you
put
up
brindley
asked
edward
henry
majestic
said
edward
henry
where
do
you
oh
kingsway
i
suppose
the
majestic
and
the
kingsway
were
two
of
the
very
large
and
very
mediocre
hotels
in
london
which
from
causes
which
nobody
and
especially
no
american
has
ever
been
able
to
discover
are
particularly
affected
by
midland
provincials
on
the
jaunt
both
had
an
immense
reputation
in
the
five
towns
there
was
nothing
new
to
say
about
the
majestic
and
the
kingsway
and
the
talk
flagged
until
quorrall
mentioned
seven
sachs
the
mighty
seven
sachs
in
his
play
overheard
had
taken
precedence
of
all
other
topics
in
the
five
towns
during
the
previous
week
he
had
crammed
the
theatre
and
half
emptied
the
empire
music
hall
for
six
nights
a
wonderful
feat
incidentally
his
fifteen
hundredth
appearance
in
overheard
had
taken
place
in
the
five
towns
and
the
five
towns
had
found
in
this
fact
a
peculiar
satisfaction
as
though
some
deep
merit
had
thereby
been
acquired
or
rewarded
seven
sachs
tour
was
now
closed
and
on
the
sunday
he
had
gone
to
london
for
america
i
heard
stops
at
wilkins
said
garvin
wilkins
your
grandmother
brindley
essayed
to
crush
garvin
i
do
say
he
stop
at
wilkins
said
garvin
an
individual
not
easy
to
crush
i
only
say
i
heard
as
he
did
they
would
have
him
brindley
insisted
firmly
quorrall
at
any
rate
seemed
tacitly
to
agree
with
brindley
the
august
name
of
wilkins
was
in
its
essence
so
exclusive
that
vast
numbers
of
fairly
canny
provincials
had
never
heard
of
it
ask
ten
provincials
which
is
the
first
hotel
in
london
and
nine
of
them
would
certainly
reply
the
grand
babylon
not
that
even
wealthy
provincials
from
the
industrial
districts
are
in
the
habit
of
staying
at
the
grand
babylon
no
edward
henry
for
example
had
never
stayed
at
the
grand
babylon
no
more
than
he
had
ever
bought
a
ticket
on
a
railroad
the
idea
of
doing
so
had
scarcely
occurred
to
him
there
are
certain
ways
of
extravagant
smartness
which
are
not
considered
to
be
good
form
among
solid
wealthy
provincials
why
travel
they
argue
when
second
is
just
as
good
and
no
one
can
tell
the
difference
once
you
get
out
of
the
train
why
ape
the
tricks
of
another
stratum
of
society
they
like
to
read
about
the
and
at
the
grand
babylon
but
they
are
not
emulous
and
they
do
not
imitate
at
their
most
adventurous
they
would
lunch
or
dine
in
the
neutral
region
of
the
at
the
grand
babylon
as
for
wilkins
in
devonshire
square
which
is
infinitely
better
known
among
princes
than
in
the
five
towns
and
whose
name
is
affectionately
pronounced
with
a
v
by
half
the
monarchs
of
europe
few
industrial
provincials
had
ever
seen
it
the
class
which
is
the
backbone
of
england
left
it
serenely
alone
to
royalty
and
the
aristocratic
parasites
of
royalty
i
do
see
why
they
should
have
him
said
edward
henry
as
he
lifted
a
challenging
nose
in
the
air
perhaps
you
do
alderman
said
brindley
would
mind
going
to
wilkins
edward
henry
persisted
i
like
to
see
you
said
brindley
with
curt
scorn
well
said
edward
henry
i
bet
you
a
fiver
i
do
had
he
not
won
eighteenpence
halfpenny
and
was
he
not
securely
at
peace
with
his
wife
i
do
bet
fivers
said
the
cautious
brindley
but
i
bet
you
done
said
edward
henry
when
will
you
go
either
or
i
must
go
to
the
majestic
first
because
i
ordered
a
room
and
so
on
ha
hurtled
brindley
as
if
to
insinuate
that
edward
henry
was
seeking
to
escape
from
the
consequences
of
his
boast
and
yet
he
ought
to
have
known
edward
henry
he
did
know
edward
henry
and
he
hoped
to
lose
his
on
his
face
and
on
the
faces
of
the
other
two
was
the
cheerful
admission
that
tales
of
the
doings
of
alderman
machin
the
great
local
card
at
wilkins
if
he
succeeded
in
getting
in
would
be
cheap
at
porters
cried
out
euston
ii
it
was
rather
late
in
the
afternoon
when
edward
henry
arrived
in
front
of
the
façade
of
wilkins
he
came
in
a
and
though
the
distance
from
the
majestic
to
wilkins
is
not
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
and
he
had
had
nothing
else
to
preoccupy
him
after
lunch
he
had
spent
some
three
hours
in
the
business
of
transferring
himself
from
the
portals
of
the
one
hotel
to
the
portals
of
the
other
two
hours
and
of
this
period
of
time
had
been
passed
in
finding
courage
merely
to
start
even
so
he
had
left
his
luggage
behind
him
he
said
to
himself
that
first
of
all
he
would
go
and
spy
out
wilkins
in
the
perilous
work
of
scouting
he
rightly
wished
to
be
unhampered
by
impedimenta
moreover
in
case
of
repulse
or
accident
he
must
have
a
base
of
operations
upon
which
he
could
retreat
in
good
order
he
now
looked
on
wilkins
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
he
was
even
more
afraid
of
it
than
he
had
been
while
thinking
about
it
in
the
vestibule
of
the
majestic
it
was
not
larger
than
the
majestic
it
was
perhaps
smaller
it
could
not
show
more
and
sculptured
cornice
than
the
majestic
but
it
had
a
demeanour
and
it
was
in
a
square
which
had
a
demeanour
in
every
not
only
of
the
hotel
but
of
nearly
every
mighty
house
in
the
square
there
were
boxes
of
bright
blooming
flowers
these
he
could
plainly
distinguish
in
the
october
dusk
and
they
were
a
wonderful
phenomenon
say
what
you
will
about
the
mildness
of
that
particular
october
a
sublime
tranquillity
reigned
over
the
scene
a
liveried
keeper
was
locking
the
gate
of
the
garden
in
the
middle
of
the
square
as
if
potentates
had
just
quitted
it
and
rendered
it
for
ever
sacred
and
between
the
sacred
shadowed
grove
and
the
inscrutable
fronts
of
the
stately
houses
there
flitted
automobiles
of
the
silent
and
expensive
kind
driven
by
chauffeurs
in
pale
grey
or
dark
purple
who
reclined
as
they
steered
and
who
were
supported
on
their
left
sides
by
footmen
who
reclined
as
they
contemplated
the
grandeur
of
existence
edward
henry
in
that
square
seemed
like
a
homeless
cat
that
had
strayed
into
a
at
the
exact
instant
when
the
came
to
rest
under
the
massive
portico
of
wilkins
a
chamberlain
in
white
gloves
bravely
soiled
the
gloves
by
seizing
the
vile
brass
handle
of
its
door
he
bowed
to
edward
henry
and
assisted
him
to
alight
on
to
a
crimson
carpet
the
driver
of
the
taxi
glanced
with
pert
and
candid
scorn
at
the
chamberlain
but
edward
henry
looked
demurely
aside
and
then
in
abstraction
mounted
the
broad
carpeted
steps
what
about
poor
little
me
cried
the
driver
who
was
evidently
a
ribald
socialist
or
at
best
a
republican
the
chamberlain
pained
glanced
at
edward
henry
for
support
and
direction
in
this
crisis
did
i
tell
you
i
keep
you
said
edward
henry
raised
now
by
the
steps
above
the
driver
between
you
and
me
you
did
said
the
driver
the
chamberlain
with
an
ineffable
gesture
wafted
the
away
into
some
limbo
appointed
for
waiting
vehicles
a
page
opened
a
pair
of
doors
and
another
page
opened
another
pair
of
doors
each
with
eighteen
century
ceremonies
of
deference
and
edward
henry
stood
at
length
in
the
hall
of
wilkins
the
sanctuary
then
was
successfully
defiled
and
up
to
the
present
nobody
had
demanded
his
credentials
he
took
breath
in
its
physical
aspects
wilkins
appeared
to
him
to
resemble
other
hotels
such
as
the
majestic
and
so
far
he
was
not
mistaken
once
wilkins
had
not
resembled
other
hotels
for
many
years
it
had
deliberately
refused
to
recognize
that
even
the
nineteenth
century
had
dawned
and
its
magnificent
antique
discomfort
had
been
one
of
its
main
attractions
to
the
elect
for
the
elect
desired
nothing
but
their
own
privileged
society
in
order
to
be
happy
in
a
hotel
a
on
a
blanket
in
the
middle
of
the
bedroom
floor
richly
sufficed
them
provided
they
could
be
guaranteed
against
the
calamity
of
meeting
the
unelect
in
the
corridors
or
at
but
the
rising
waters
of
democracy
the
intermixture
of
classes
had
reacted
adversely
on
wilkins
the
fall
of
the
emperor
maximilian
of
mexico
had
given
wilkins
sad
food
for
thought
long
long
ago
and
the
obvious
general
weakening
of
the
monarchical
principle
had
most
considerably
shaken
it
came
the
day
when
wilkins
reluctantly
decided
that
even
it
could
not
fight
against
the
tendency
of
the
whole
world
and
then
at
one
superb
stroke
it
had
rebuilt
and
brought
itself
utterly
thus
it
resembled
other
hotels
save
possibly
in
the
reticence
of
its
advertisements
the
majestic
would
advertise
bathrooms
as
a
miracle
of
modernity
just
as
though
common
had
not
possessed
bathrooms
for
the
past
thirty
years
wilkins
had
superlative
bathrooms
but
it
said
nothing
about
them
wilkins
would
as
soon
have
advertised
two
hundred
bathrooms
as
two
hundred
bolsters
and
for
the
new
wilkins
a
bathroom
was
not
more
modern
than
a
bolster
also
other
hotels
resembled
wilkins
the
majestic
too
had
a
chamberlain
at
its
portico
and
an
assortment
of
pages
to
prove
to
its
clients
that
they
were
incapable
of
performing
the
simplest
act
for
themselves
nevertheless
the
difference
between
wilkins
and
the
majestic
was
enormous
and
yet
so
subtle
was
it
that
edward
henry
could
not
immediately
detect
where
it
resided
then
he
understood
the
difference
between
wilkins
and
the
majestic
resided
in
the
theory
which
underlay
its
manner
and
the
theory
was
that
every
person
entering
its
walls
was
of
royal
blood
until
he
had
admitted
the
contrary
within
the
hotel
it
was
already
night
edward
henry
crossed
the
illuminated
hall
which
was
dotted
with
fashionable
figures
he
knew
not
whither
he
was
going
until
by
chance
he
saw
a
golden
grille
with
the
word
reception
shining
over
it
in
letters
of
gold
behind
this
grille
and
still
further
protected
by
an
impregnable
mahogany
counter
stood
three
young
dandies
in
attitudes
of
graceful
ease
he
approached
them
the
fearful
moment
was
upon
him
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
so
genuinely
frightened
abject
disgrace
might
be
his
portion
within
the
next
ten
seconds
addressing
himself
to
the
dandy
in
the
middle
he
managed
to
articulate
what
have
you
got
in
the
way
of
rooms
could
the
five
towns
have
seen
him
then
as
he
waited
it
would
hardly
have
recognized
its
card
its
character
its
mirror
of
aplomb
and
inventive
audacity
in
this
figure
of
provincial
and
plebeian
diffidence
the
dandy
bowed
do
you
want
a
suite
sir
certainly
said
edward
henry
rather
too
quickly
rather
too
defiantly
in
fact
rather
rudely
a
would
not
have
so
savagely
hurled
back
in
the
dandy
teeth
the
insinuation
that
he
wanted
only
one
paltry
room
however
the
dandy
smiled
accepting
with
meekness
edward
sudden
arrogance
and
consulted
a
sort
of
pentateuch
that
was
open
in
front
of
him
no
person
in
the
hall
saw
edward
henry
hat
fly
up
into
the
air
and
fall
back
on
his
head
but
in
the
imagination
of
edward
henry
this
was
what
his
hat
did
he
was
saved
he
would
have
a
proud
tale
for
brindley
the
thing
was
as
simple
as
the
alphabet
you
just
walked
in
and
they
either
fell
on
your
neck
or
kissed
your
feet
wilkins
indeed
a
very
handsome
footman
not
only
in
white
gloves
but
in
white
calves
was
soon
supplicating
him
to
deign
to
enter
a
lift
and
when
he
emerged
from
the
lift
another
dandy
in
a
of
paradise
was
awaiting
him
with
obeisances
apparently
it
had
not
yet
occurred
to
anybody
that
he
was
not
the
younger
son
of
some
aged
king
he
was
prayed
to
walk
into
a
gorgeous
suite
consisting
of
a
corridor
a
noble
with
portrait
of
his
majesty
of
spain
on
the
walls
a
large
bedroom
with
two
beds
a
small
bedroom
and
a
bathroom
all
gleaming
with
patent
devices
in
porcelain
and
silver
that
fully
equalled
those
at
home
asked
if
this
suite
would
do
he
said
it
would
trying
as
well
as
he
could
to
imply
that
he
had
seen
better
then
the
dandy
produced
a
and
a
pencil
and
impassively
waited
the
horrid
fact
that
he
was
unelect
could
no
longer
be
concealed
machin
bursley
he
said
shortly
and
added
alderman
machin
after
all
why
should
he
be
ashamed
of
being
an
alderman
to
his
astonishment
the
dandy
smiled
very
cordially
though
always
with
profound
respect
ah
yes
said
the
dandy
it
was
as
though
he
had
said
we
have
long
wished
for
the
high
patronage
of
this
great
reputation
edward
henry
could
make
naught
of
it
his
opinion
of
wilkins
went
down
he
followed
the
departing
dandy
up
the
corridor
to
the
door
of
the
suite
in
an
entirely
vain
attempt
to
inquire
the
price
of
the
suite
per
day
not
a
syllable
would
pass
his
lips
the
dandy
bowed
and
vanished
edward
henry
stood
lost
at
his
own
door
and
his
wandering
eye
caught
sight
of
a
pile
of
trunks
near
to
another
door
in
the
main
corridor
these
trunks
gave
him
a
terrible
shock
he
shut
out
the
rest
of
the
hotel
and
retired
into
his
private
corridor
to
reflect
he
perceived
only
too
plainly
that
his
luggage
now
at
the
majestic
never
could
come
into
wilkins
it
was
not
fashionable
enough
it
lacked
elegance
the
that
he
was
wearing
might
serve
but
his
luggage
was
totally
impossible
never
before
had
he
imagined
that
the
aspect
of
one
luggage
could
have
the
least
importance
in
scheme
of
existence
he
was
learning
and
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
was
in
an
incomparable
mess
iii
at
the
end
of
an
extensive
stroll
through
and
round
his
new
vast
domain
he
had
come
to
no
decision
upon
a
course
of
action
certain
details
of
the
strange
adventure
pleased
him
as
for
instance
the
dandy
welcoming
recognition
of
his
name
that
though
puzzling
was
a
source
of
comfort
to
him
in
his
difficulties
he
also
liked
the
suite
nay
more
he
was
much
impressed
by
its
gorgeousness
and
such
novel
complications
as
the
forked
electric
switches
all
of
which
he
turned
on
and
the
double
windows
one
within
the
other
appealed
to
the
domestic
expert
in
him
indeed
he
at
once
had
the
idea
of
doubling
the
window
of
the
best
bedroom
at
home
to
do
so
would
be
a
fierce
blow
to
the
five
towns
electric
traction
company
which
as
everybody
knew
delighted
to
keep
everybody
awake
at
night
and
at
dawn
by
means
of
its
late
and
its
early
however
he
could
not
wander
up
and
down
the
glittering
solitude
of
his
extensive
suite
for
ever
something
must
be
done
then
he
had
the
notion
of
writing
to
nellie
he
had
promised
himself
to
write
her
daily
moreover
it
would
pass
the
time
and
perhaps
help
him
to
some
resolution
he
sat
down
to
a
delicate
louis
xvi
desk
on
which
lay
a
bible
a
peerage
a
a
telephone
a
lamp
and
much
distinguished
stationery
between
the
tasselled
folds
of
plushy
curtains
that
pleated
themselves
with
the
grandeur
of
painted
curtains
in
a
theatre
he
glanced
out
at
the
lights
of
devonshire
square
from
which
not
a
sound
came
then
he
lit
the
lamp
and
unscrewed
his
my
dear
wife
that
was
how
he
always
began
whether
in
storm
or
sunshine
nellie
always
began
my
darling
husband
but
he
was
not
a
man
to
fling
darlings
about
few
husbands
in
the
five
towns
are
he
thought
darling
but
he
never
wrote
it
and
he
never
said
it
save
quizzingly
after
these
three
words
the
composition
of
the
letter
came
to
a
pause
what
was
he
going
to
tell
nellie
he
assuredly
was
not
going
to
tell
her
that
he
had
engaged
an
unpriced
suite
at
wilkins
he
was
not
going
to
mention
wilkins
then
he
intelligently
perceived
that
the
and
also
the
envelope
mentioned
wilkins
in
no
ambiguous
manner
he
tore
up
the
sheet
and
searched
for
plain
paper
now
on
the
desk
there
was
the
ordinary
hotel
stationery
mourning
stationery
cards
and
envelopes
for
every
mood
but
not
a
piece
that
was
not
embossed
with
the
historic
name
in
royal
blue
the
which
appeared
to
edward
henry
to
point
to
a
defect
of
foresight
on
the
part
of
wilkins
at
the
gigantic
political
club
to
which
he
belonged
and
which
he
had
occasionally
visited
in
order
to
demonstrate
to
himself
and
others
that
he
was
a
clubman
plain
stationery
was
everywhere
provided
for
the
use
of
husbands
with
a
taste
for
reticence
why
not
at
wilkins
also
on
the
other
hand
why
should
he
write
to
his
wife
on
paper
was
he
afraid
of
his
wife
he
was
not
would
not
the
news
ultimately
reach
bursley
that
he
had
stayed
at
wilkins
it
would
nevertheless
he
could
not
find
the
courage
to
write
to
nellie
on
wilkins
paper
he
looked
around
he
was
fearfully
alone
he
wanted
the
companionship
were
it
only
momentary
of
something
human
he
decided
to
have
a
look
at
the
flunkey
and
he
rang
a
bell
immediately
just
as
though
wafted
thither
on
a
magic
carpet
from
the
court
of
austria
a
arrived
in
the
doorway
of
the
planted
himself
gracefully
on
his
black
silk
calves
and
bowed
i
want
some
plain
please
very
good
sir
oh
perfection
of
tone
and
of
mien
three
minutes
later
the
plain
and
envelopes
were
being
presented
to
edward
henry
on
a
salver
as
he
took
them
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
who
supported
his
gaze
with
an
impenetrable
invulnerable
servility
edward
henry
beaten
off
with
great
loss
thought
there
nothing
doing
here
just
now
in
the
human
companionship
line
and
assumed
the
mask
of
a
hereditary
prince
the
black
calves
carried
away
their
immaculate
living
burden
set
above
all
earthly
ties
he
wrote
nicely
to
nellie
about
the
weather
and
the
journey
and
informed
her
also
that
london
seemed
as
full
as
ever
and
that
he
might
go
to
the
theatre
but
he
was
sure
he
dated
the
letter
from
the
majestic
as
he
was
finishing
it
he
heard
mysterious
disturbing
footfalls
in
his
private
corridor
and
after
trying
for
some
time
to
ignore
them
he
was
forced
by
a
vague
alarm
to
investigate
their
origin
a
short
pallid
man
with
a
long
nose
and
long
moustaches
wearing
a
sleeved
waistcoat
and
a
white
apron
was
in
the
corridor
at
the
turk
head
such
a
person
would
have
been
the
boots
but
edward
henry
remembered
a
notice
under
the
bell
advising
visitors
to
ring
once
for
the
waiter
twice
for
the
chambermaid
and
three
times
for
the
valet
this
then
was
the
valet
in
certain
picturesque
details
of
costume
wilkins
was
coquettishly
french
what
is
it
he
demanded
i
came
to
see
if
your
luggage
had
arrived
sir
no
doubt
your
servant
is
bringing
it
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
the
man
thoughtfully
twirled
one
end
of
his
moustache
it
was
an
appalling
fault
in
demeanour
but
the
man
was
proud
of
his
moustache
the
first
human
being
i
met
here
thought
edward
henry
attracted
too
by
a
gleam
in
the
eye
of
this
eternal
haunter
of
corridors
his
servant
he
saw
that
something
must
be
done
and
quickly
wilkins
provided
valets
for
emergencies
but
obviously
it
expected
visitors
to
bring
their
own
valets
in
addition
obviously
existence
without
a
private
valet
was
inconceivable
to
wilkins
the
fact
is
said
edward
henry
i
in
a
very
awkward
situation
he
hesitated
seeking
to
and
fro
in
his
mind
for
particulars
of
the
situation
sorry
to
hear
that
sir
yes
a
very
awkward
situation
he
hesitated
again
i
booked
passages
for
myself
and
my
valet
on
the
sailing
from
tilbury
at
noon
and
sent
him
on
in
front
with
my
stuff
and
at
the
very
last
moment
i
been
absolutely
prevented
from
sailing
you
see
how
awkward
it
is
i
have
a
thing
here
it
is
indeed
sir
and
i
suppose
gone
on
sir
of
course
he
has
he
would
find
out
till
after
she
sailed
that
i
was
on
board
you
know
the
crush
and
confusion
there
is
on
those
big
liners
just
before
they
start
edward
henry
had
once
assisted
under
very
dramatic
circumstances
at
the
departure
of
a
transatlantic
liner
from
liverpool
just
so
sir
i
neither
servant
nor
clothes
he
considered
that
so
far
he
was
doing
admirably
indeed
the
tale
could
not
have
been
bettered
he
thought
his
hope
was
that
the
fellow
would
not
have
the
idea
of
consulting
the
shipping
intelligence
in
order
to
confirm
the
departure
of
the
from
tilbury
that
day
possibly
the
never
had
sailed
and
never
would
sail
from
tilbury
possibly
she
had
been
sold
years
ago
he
had
selected
the
first
ship
name
that
came
into
his
head
what
did
it
matter
my
man
he
added
to
clinch
the
proper
word
man
had
only
just
occurred
to
him
my
man
ca
be
back
again
under
three
weeks
at
the
soonest
the
valet
made
one
step
towards
him
if
you
wanting
a
temporary
valet
sir
my
son
out
of
a
place
for
the
moment
through
no
fault
of
his
own
he
a
very
good
valet
sir
and
soon
learns
a
gentleman
ways
yes
said
edward
henry
judiciously
but
could
he
come
at
once
that
the
point
and
he
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
to
imply
that
another
hour
without
a
valet
would
be
more
than
human
nature
could
stand
i
could
have
him
round
here
in
less
than
an
hour
sir
said
the
comprehending
the
gesture
he
at
norwich
mews
berkeley
square
way
sir
edward
henry
hesitated
very
well
then
he
said
commandingly
send
for
him
let
me
see
him
he
thought
dash
it
i
at
wilkins
i
be
wilkins
certainly
sir
thank
you
very
much
sir
the
was
retiring
when
edward
henry
called
him
back
stop
a
moment
i
just
going
out
help
me
on
with
my
overcoat
will
you
the
man
jumped
and
you
might
get
me
a
edward
henry
airily
suggested
and
i
a
letter
for
the
post
as
he
walked
down
devonshire
square
in
the
dark
he
hummed
a
tune
certain
sign
that
he
was
uneasy
and
yet
not
unhappy
at
a
small
but
expensive
hosier
in
a
side
street
he
bought
a
shirt
and
a
suit
of
pyjamas
and
also
permitted
himself
to
be
tempted
by
a
special
job
line
of
that
the
hosier
had
in
his
fancy
department
on
hearing
the
powerful
word
wilkins
the
hosier
promised
with
passionate
obsequiousness
that
the
goods
should
be
delivered
instantly
edward
henry
cooled
his
excitement
by
an
extended
stroll
and
finally
the
outer
hall
of
the
hotel
at
seven
and
sat
down
therein
to
see
the
world
he
knew
by
instinct
that
the
boldest
must
not
at
that
hour
penetrate
further
into
the
public
rooms
of
wilkins
the
world
at
its
haughtiest
was
driving
up
to
wilkins
to
eat
its
dinner
in
the
unrivalled
restaurant
and
often
guests
staying
at
the
hotel
came
into
the
outer
hall
to
greet
invited
friends
and
edward
henry
was
so
overfaced
by
visions
of
woman
brilliance
and
utter
correctness
that
he
scarcely
knew
where
to
look
so
apologetic
was
he
for
his
grey
and
the
creases
in
his
boots
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
appreciated
with
painful
clearness
that
his
entire
conception
of
existence
had
been
wrong
and
that
he
must
begin
again
at
the
beginning
nothing
in
his
luggage
at
the
majestic
would
do
his
socks
would
not
do
nor
his
shoes
nor
the
braid
on
his
trousers
nor
his
nor
his
white
bow
nor
the
number
of
studs
in
his
nor
the
collar
of
his
coat
nothing
nothing
would
be
a
full
day
he
ventured
apologetically
into
the
lift
in
his
private
corridor
a
young
man
respectfully
waited
hat
in
hand
the
paternal
waistcoat
by
his
side
for
purposes
of
introduction
the
young
man
was
wearing
a
rather
shabby
blue
suit
but
a
rich
and
distinguished
overcoat
that
fitted
him
ill
in
another
five
minutes
edward
henry
had
engaged
a
skilled
valet
aged
name
joseph
with
a
testimonial
of
efficiency
from
sir
nicholas
winkworth
at
a
salary
of
a
pound
a
week
and
all
found
joseph
seemed
to
await
instructions
and
edward
henry
was
placed
in
a
new
quandary
he
knew
not
whether
the
small
bedroom
in
the
suite
was
for
a
child
or
for
his
wife
maid
or
for
his
valet
quite
probably
it
would
be
a
sacrilegious
defiance
of
precedent
to
put
a
valet
in
the
small
bedroom
quite
probably
wilkins
had
a
floor
for
private
valets
in
the
roof
again
quite
probably
the
small
bedroom
might
be
after
all
specially
destined
for
valets
he
could
not
decide
and
the
most
precious
thing
in
the
universe
to
him
in
that
crisis
was
his
reputation
as
a
in
the
eyes
of
joseph
but
something
had
to
be
done
you
sleep
in
this
room
said
edward
henry
indicating
the
door
i
may
want
you
in
the
night
yes
sir
said
joseph
i
presume
you
dine
up
here
sir
said
joseph
glancing
at
the
his
father
had
informed
him
of
his
new
master
predicament
i
shall
said
edward
henry
you
might
get
the
menu
iv
he
had
a
very
bad
night
indeed
owing
no
doubt
partly
to
a
general
uneasiness
in
his
unusual
surroundings
and
partly
also
to
a
special
uneasiness
caused
by
the
propinquity
of
a
sleeping
valet
but
the
main
origin
of
it
was
certainly
his
dreadful
anxiety
about
the
question
of
a
tailor
in
the
organization
of
his
new
life
a
tailor
was
essential
and
he
was
not
acquainted
with
a
london
tailor
he
did
not
know
a
great
deal
concerning
clothes
though
quite
passably
well
dressed
for
a
provincial
but
he
knew
enough
to
be
sure
that
it
was
impossible
to
judge
the
merits
of
a
tailor
by
his
signboard
and
therefore
that
if
wandering
in
the
precincts
of
bond
street
he
entered
the
first
establishment
that
looked
likely
he
would
have
a
good
chance
of
being
done
in
the
eye
so
he
phrased
it
to
himself
as
he
lay
in
bed
he
wanted
a
definite
and
utterly
reliable
address
he
rang
the
bell
only
as
it
happened
to
be
the
wrong
bell
he
obtained
the
presence
of
joseph
in
a
roundabout
way
through
the
agency
of
a
such
however
is
the
human
faculty
of
adaptation
to
environment
that
he
was
merely
amused
in
the
morning
by
an
error
which
on
the
previous
night
would
have
put
him
into
a
sweat
good
morning
sir
said
joseph
edward
henry
nodded
his
hands
under
his
head
as
he
lay
on
his
back
he
decided
to
leave
all
initiative
to
joseph
the
man
drew
up
the
blinds
and
closing
the
double
windows
at
the
top
opened
them
very
wide
at
the
bottom
it
is
a
rainy
morning
sir
said
joseph
letting
in
vast
quantities
of
air
from
devonshire
square
clearly
sir
nicholas
winkworth
had
been
a
breezy
master
oh
murmured
edward
henry
he
felt
a
careless
contempt
for
joseph
flunkeyism
hitherto
he
had
had
the
theory
that
footmen
valets
and
all
male
personal
attendants
were
an
inexcusable
excrescence
on
the
social
fabric
the
mere
sight
of
them
often
angered
him
though
for
some
reason
he
had
no
objection
whatever
to
servility
in
a
maid
indeed
rather
enjoyed
it
but
now
in
the
person
of
joseph
he
saw
that
there
were
human
or
beings
born
to
and
that
if
their
destiny
was
to
be
fulfilled
valetry
was
a
necessary
institution
he
had
no
pity
for
joseph
no
shame
in
employing
him
he
scorned
joseph
and
yet
his
desire
as
a
to
keep
joseph
esteem
was
in
no
way
diminished
shall
i
prepare
your
bath
sir
asked
joseph
stationed
in
a
supple
attitude
by
the
side
of
the
bed
edward
henry
was
visited
by
an
idea
have
you
had
yours
he
demanded
like
a
edward
henry
saw
that
sir
nicholas
had
never
asked
that
particular
question
no
sir
not
had
your
bath
man
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
by
it
go
and
have
your
bath
at
once
a
faint
sycophantic
smile
lightened
the
amazed
features
of
joseph
and
edward
henry
thought
it
astonishing
all
the
same
the
way
they
can
read
their
masters
this
chap
has
seen
already
that
i
a
card
and
yet
how
yes
sir
said
joseph
have
your
bath
in
the
bathroom
here
and
be
sure
to
leave
everything
in
order
for
me
yes
sir
as
soon
as
joseph
had
gone
edward
henry
jumped
out
of
bed
and
listened
he
heard
the
discreet
joseph
respectfully
push
the
bolt
of
the
bathroom
door
then
he
crept
with
noiseless
rapidity
to
the
small
bedroom
and
was
aware
therein
of
a
lack
of
order
and
of
ventilation
the
rich
and
distinguished
overcoat
was
hanging
on
the
brass
knob
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
seized
it
and
scrutinizing
the
loop
read
in
yellow
letters
street
he
knew
that
quayther
cuthering
must
be
the
tailors
of
sir
nicholas
winkworth
and
hence
hoping
for
the
best
and
putting
his
trust
in
the
general
decency
of
human
nature
he
did
not
trouble
himself
with
the
problem
was
the
overcoat
a
gift
or
an
appropriation
but
he
preferred
to
assume
the
generosity
of
sir
nicholas
rather
than
the
dishonesty
of
joseph
repassing
the
bathroom
door
he
knocked
loudly
on
its
glass
do
be
all
day
he
cried
he
was
in
a
hurry
now
an
hour
later
he
said
to
joseph
i
going
down
to
quayther
cuthering
yes
sir
said
joseph
obviously
much
reassured
nincompoop
edward
henry
exclaimed
secretly
the
fool
thinks
better
of
me
because
my
tailors
are
but
edward
henry
had
failed
to
notice
that
he
himself
was
thinking
better
of
himself
because
he
had
adopted
tailors
beneath
the
main
door
of
his
suite
as
he
went
forth
he
found
a
business
card
of
the
west
end
electric
brougham
supply
agency
and
downstairs
solely
to
impress
his
individuality
on
the
he
showed
the
card
to
that
vizier
with
the
casual
question
these
people
any
good
an
excellent
firm
sir
what
do
they
charge
by
the
week
sir
he
hesitated
yes
by
the
week
twenty
guineas
sir
well
you
might
telephone
for
one
can
you
get
it
at
once
certainly
sir
the
vizier
turned
towards
the
telephone
in
his
lair
i
say
said
edward
henry
sir
i
suppose
one
will
be
enough
well
sir
as
a
rule
yes
said
the
vizier
calmly
sometimes
i
get
a
couple
for
one
family
sir
though
he
had
started
jocularly
edward
henry
finished
by
blenching
i
think
one
will
do
i
may
possibly
send
for
my
own
car
he
drove
to
quayther
cuthering
in
his
electric
brougham
and
there
dropped
casually
the
name
of
winkworth
he
explained
humorously
his
singular
misadventure
of
the
and
was
very
successful
therewith
so
successful
indeed
that
he
actually
began
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
adventure
himself
and
had
an
irrational
impulse
to
dispatch
a
wireless
message
to
his
bewildered
valet
on
board
the
subsequently
he
paid
other
fruitful
visits
in
the
neighbourhood
and
at
about
eleven
the
fruit
was
arriving
at
wilkins
in
the
shape
of
many
parcels
and
boxes
comprising
diverse
items
in
the
equipment
of
a
such
as
and
innovation
trunks
returning
late
to
wilkins
for
lunch
he
marched
jauntily
into
the
large
brilliant
restaurant
and
commenced
an
adequate
repast
of
course
he
was
still
wearing
his
mediocre
his
sole
suit
for
another
two
days
but
somehow
the
consciousness
that
quayther
cuthering
were
cutting
out
wondrous
garments
for
him
in
vigo
street
stiffened
his
shoulders
and
gave
a
mysterious
style
to
that
at
lunch
he
made
one
mistake
and
enjoyed
one
very
remarkable
piece
of
luck
the
mistake
was
to
order
an
artichoke
he
did
not
know
how
to
eat
an
artichoke
he
had
never
tried
to
eat
an
artichoke
and
his
first
essay
in
this
difficult
and
complex
craft
was
a
sad
fiasco
it
would
not
have
mattered
if
at
the
table
next
to
his
own
there
had
not
been
two
obviously
experienced
women
one
with
a
red
hat
the
other
with
a
blue
hat
one
the
other
much
younger
but
both
very
observant
and
even
so
it
would
scarcely
have
mattered
had
not
the
younger
woman
been
so
slim
pretty
and
alluring
while
tolerably
careless
of
the
opinion
of
the
plain
woman
of
he
desired
the
unqualified
approval
of
the
delightful
young
thing
in
the
blue
hat
they
certainly
interested
themselves
in
his
manoeuvres
with
the
artichoke
and
their
amusement
was
imperfectly
concealed
he
forgave
the
blue
hat
but
considered
that
the
red
hat
ought
to
have
known
better
they
could
not
be
princesses
nor
even
titled
aristocrats
he
supposed
them
to
belong
to
some
county
family
the
piece
of
luck
consisted
in
the
passage
down
the
restaurant
of
the
countess
of
chell
who
had
been
lunching
there
with
a
party
and
whom
he
had
known
locally
in
more
gusty
days
the
countess
bowed
stiffly
to
the
red
hat
and
the
red
hat
responded
with
eager
fulsomeness
it
seemed
to
be
here
as
it
no
longer
was
in
the
five
towns
everybody
knew
everybody
the
red
hat
and
the
blue
might
be
titled
after
all
he
thought
then
by
sheer
accident
the
countess
caught
sight
of
himself
and
stopped
dead
bringing
her
escort
to
a
standstill
behind
her
edward
henry
blushed
and
rose
is
it
mr
machin
murmured
the
still
lovely
creature
warmly
they
shook
hands
never
had
social
pleasure
so
thrilled
him
the
conversation
was
short
he
did
not
presume
on
the
past
he
knew
that
here
he
was
not
on
his
own
ashpit
as
they
say
in
the
five
towns
the
countess
and
her
escort
went
forward
edward
henry
sat
down
again
he
gave
the
red
and
the
blue
hats
one
calm
glance
which
they
failed
to
withstand
the
affair
of
the
artichoke
was
for
ever
wiped
out
after
lunch
he
went
forth
again
in
his
electric
brougham
the
weather
had
cleared
the
opulent
streets
were
full
of
pride
and
sunshine
and
as
he
penetrated
into
one
shop
after
another
receiving
kowtows
obeisances
curtsies
homage
surrender
resignation
submission
he
gradually
comprehended
that
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
world
and
that
those
who
are
called
to
greatness
must
accept
with
dignity
the
ceremonials
inseparable
from
greatness
and
the
world
had
never
seemed
to
him
so
fine
nor
any
adventure
so
diverting
and
uplifting
as
this
adventure
when
he
returned
to
his
suite
his
private
corridor
was
piled
up
with
a
numerous
and
excessively
attractive
assortment
of
parcels
joseph
took
his
overcoat
and
hat
and
a
new
umbrella
and
placed
an
conveniently
for
him
in
the
get
my
bill
he
said
shortly
to
joseph
as
he
sank
into
the
gilded
fauteuil
yes
sir
one
advantage
of
a
valet
he
discovered
is
that
you
can
order
him
to
do
things
which
to
do
yourself
would
more
than
exhaust
your
moral
courage
the
brought
the
bill
it
lay
on
a
salver
and
was
folded
conceivably
so
as
to
break
the
shock
of
it
to
the
recipient
edward
henry
took
it
wait
a
minute
he
said
he
read
on
the
bill
apartments
dinner
breakfast
lunch
half
chablis
valet
board
that
a
bit
thick
for
that
he
said
to
himself
however
the
next
instant
he
blenched
once
more
gosh
he
privately
exclaimed
as
he
read
paid
driver
of
he
had
forgotten
the
taxi
but
he
admired
the
of
wilkins
which
paid
such
trifles
as
a
matter
of
course
without
deigning
to
disturb
a
guest
by
an
inquiry
wilkins
rose
again
in
his
esteem
the
total
of
the
bill
exceeded
thirteen
pounds
all
right
he
said
to
the
are
you
leaving
sir
the
being
permitted
himself
to
ask
of
course
i
not
leaving
have
i
hired
an
electric
brougham
for
a
week
edward
henry
burst
out
but
i
suppose
entitled
to
know
how
much
i
spending
the
humbly
bowed
and
departed
alone
in
the
splendid
chamber
edward
henry
drew
out
a
swollen
and
examined
its
crisp
crinkly
contents
which
made
a
beauteous
and
a
reassuring
sight
pooh
he
muttered
he
reckoned
he
would
be
living
at
the
rate
of
about
fifteen
pounds
a
day
or
five
thousand
five
hundred
a
year
he
did
not
count
the
cost
of
his
purchases
because
they
were
in
the
nature
of
a
capital
expenditure
cheap
he
muttered
for
once
i
about
living
up
to
my
income
the
sensation
was
exquisite
in
its
novelty
he
ordered
tea
and
afterwards
feeling
sleepy
he
went
fast
asleep
he
awoke
to
the
ringing
of
the
it
was
quite
dark
the
continued
to
ring
joseph
he
called
the
valet
entered
what
time
is
it
after
ten
sir
the
deuce
it
is
he
had
slept
over
four
hours
well
answer
that
confounded
telephone
joseph
obeyed
it
a
bryany
sir
if
i
catch
the
name
right
said
joseph
bryany
for
hours
he
had
scarcely
thought
of
bryany
or
the
option
either
bring
the
telephone
here
said
edward
henry
the
cord
would
just
reach
to
his
chair
hello
bryany
is
that
you
cried
edward
henry
gaily
and
then
he
heard
the
weakened
voice
of
bryany
in
his
ear
how
d
do
machin
i
been
after
you
for
the
better
part
of
two
days
and
now
i
find
you
staying
in
the
same
hotel
as
sachs
and
me
oh
said
edward
henry
he
understood
now
why
on
the
previous
day
the
dandy
introducing
him
to
his
suite
had
smiled
a
welcome
at
the
name
of
alderman
machin
and
why
joseph
had
accepted
so
naturally
the
command
to
take
a
bath
bryany
had
been
talking
bryany
had
been
recounting
his
exploits
as
a
card
the
voice
of
bryany
in
his
ear
continued
look
here
i
got
miss
euclid
here
and
some
friends
of
hers
of
course
she
wants
to
see
you
at
once
can
you
come
down
er
he
hesitated
he
could
not
come
down
he
would
have
no
evening
wear
till
the
next
day
but
one
said
the
voice
of
bryany
what
i
ca
said
edward
henry
i
not
very
well
but
listen
all
of
you
come
up
to
my
rooms
here
and
have
supper
will
you
suite
i
ask
the
lady
said
the
voice
of
bryany
altered
now
and
a
few
seconds
later
we
coming
joseph
edward
henry
gave
orders
rapidly
as
he
took
off
his
coat
and
removed
the
from
it
i
ill
you
understand
anyhow
not
well
take
this
handing
him
the
coat
and
bring
me
the
new

green
cardboard
box

rollet
i
think
it
is
and
then
get
the
supper
menu
i
very
hungry
i
had
no
dinner
within
sixty
seconds
he
sat
in
state
wearing
a
grandiose
yellow
the
change
was
accomplished
just
in
time
bryany
entered
and
not
only
bryany
but
seven
sachs
and
not
only
these
but
the
lady
who
had
worn
a
red
hat
at
lunch
miss
rose
euclid
said
bryany
puffing
and
bending
chapter
iv
entry
into
the
theatrical
world
i
once
on
a
short
visit
to
london
edward
henry
had
paid
to
be
let
into
a
certain
enclosure
with
a
very
low
ceiling
this
enclosure
was
already
crowded
with
some
three
hundred
people
sitting
and
standing
edward
henry
had
stood
in
the
only
unoccupied
spot
he
could
find
behind
a
pillar
when
he
had
made
himself
as
comfortable
as
possible
by
turning
up
his
collar
against
the
sharp
winds
that
continually
entered
from
the
street
he
had
peered
forward
and
seen
in
front
of
his
enclosure
another
and
larger
enclosure
also
crowded
with
people
but
more
expensive
people
after
a
blank
interval
of
thirty
minutes
a
band
had
begun
to
play
at
an
incredible
distance
in
front
of
him
extinguishing
the
noises
of
traffic
in
the
street
after
another
interval
an
oblong
space
rather
further
off
even
than
the
band
suddenly
grew
bright
and
edward
henry
by
curving
his
neck
first
to
one
side
of
the
pillar
and
then
to
the
other
had
had
tantalizing
glimpses
of
the
interior
of
a
doll
and
of
male
and
female
dolls
therein
he
could
only
see
even
partially
the
inferior
half
of
the
a
little
higher
than
the
heads
of
the
dolls
because
the
rest
was
cut
off
from
his
vision
by
the
lowness
of
his
own
ceiling
the
dolls
were
talking
but
he
could
not
catch
clearly
what
they
said
save
at
the
rare
moments
when
an
omnibus
or
a
van
did
not
happen
to
be
thundering
down
the
street
behind
him
then
one
special
doll
had
come
exquisitely
into
the
and
at
the
sight
of
her
the
five
hundred
people
in
front
of
him
and
numbers
of
other
people
perched
hidden
beyond
his
ceiling
had
clapped
fervently
and
even
cried
aloud
in
their
excitement
and
he
too
had
clapped
fervently
and
had
muttered
bravo
this
special
doll
was
a
marvel
of
touching
and
persuasive
grace
with
a
voice
when
edward
henry
could
hear
it
that
melted
the
spine
this
special
doll
had
every
elegance
and
seemed
to
be
in
the
highest
pride
of
youth
at
the
close
of
the
affair
as
this
special
doll
sank
into
the
embrace
of
a
male
doll
from
whom
she
had
been
unjustly
separated
and
then
straightened
herself
deliciously
and
confidently
smiling
to
take
the
tremendous
applause
of
edward
henry
and
the
rest
edward
henry
thought
that
he
had
never
assisted
at
a
triumph
so
genuine
and
so
inspiring
oblivious
of
the
pain
in
his
neck
and
of
the
choking
foul
atmosphere
of
the
enclosure
accurately
described
as
the
pit
he
had
gone
forth
into
the
street
with
a
subconscious
notion
in
his
head
that
the
special
doll
was
more
than
human
was
half
divine
and
he
had
said
afterwards
with
immense
satisfaction
at
bursley
yes
i
saw
rose
euclid
in
of
the
heart
he
had
never
set
eyes
on
her
since
and
now
on
this
day
at
wilkins
he
had
seen
in
the
restaurant
and
he
saw
again
before
him
in
his
private
parlour
a
faded
and
stoutish
woman
negligently
if
expensively
dressed
with
a
fatigued
nervous
watery
glance
an
unnatural
complexion
a
wrinkled
skin
and
dyed
hair
a
woman
of
whom
it
might
be
said
that
she
had
escaped
grandmotherhood
if
indeed
she
had
escaped
it
by
mere
luck
and
he
was
commanded
to
believe
that
she
and
rose
euclid
were
the
same
person
it
was
one
of
the
most
shattering
shocks
of
all
his
career
which
nevertheless
had
not
been
untumultuous
and
within
his
which
nobody
remarked
upon
he
was
busy
picking
up
and
piecing
together
as
quickly
as
he
could
the
shivered
fragments
of
his
ideas
he
literally
did
not
recognize
rose
euclid
true
fifteen
years
had
passed
since
the
night
in
the
pit
and
he
himself
was
fifteen
years
older
but
in
his
mind
he
had
never
pictured
any
change
in
rose
euclid
true
he
had
been
familiar
with
the
enormous
renown
of
rose
euclid
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
taking
any
interest
in
theatrical
advertisements
but
he
had
not
permitted
her
to
reach
an
age
of
more
than
about
or
two
whereas
he
now
perceived
that
even
the
exquisite
doll
in
paradise
that
he
had
gloated
over
from
his
pit
must
have
been
quite
then
well
he
scornfully
pitied
rose
euclid
he
blamed
her
for
not
having
accomplished
the
miracle
of
eternal
youth
he
actually
considered
that
she
had
cheated
him
is
this
all
what
a
swindle
he
thought
as
he
was
piecing
together
the
shivered
fragments
of
his
ideas
into
a
new
pattern
he
had
felt
much
the
same
as
a
boy
at
bursley
annual
wakes
once
on
entering
a
booth
which
promised
horrors
and
did
not
supply
them
he
had
been
done
all
these
years
reluctantly
he
admitted
that
rose
euclid
could
not
help
her
age
but
at
any
rate
she
ought
to
have
grown
older
beautifully
with
charming
dignity
and
vivacity
in
fact
she
ought
to
have
contrived
to
be
old
and
young
simultaneously
or
in
the
alternative
she
ought
to
have
modestly
retired
into
the
country
and
lived
on
her
memories
and
such
money
as
she
had
not
squandered
she
had
no
right
to
be
abroad
at
worst
she
ought
to
have
famous
and
because
her
name
and
fame
and
photographs
as
an
emotional
actress
had
been
continually
in
the
newspapers
therefore
she
ought
to
have
been
refined
delicate
distinguished
and
full
of
witty
and
gracious
that
she
had
played
the
heroine
of
flower
of
the
heart
four
hundred
times
and
the
heroine
of
the
grenadier
four
hundred
and
fifty
times
and
the
heroine
of
the
wife
ordeal
nearly
five
hundred
times
made
it
incumbent
upon
her
in
edward
henry
subconscious
opinion
to
possess
all
the
talents
of
a
woman
of
the
world
and
all
the
virgin
freshness
of
a
girl
which
shows
how
cruelly
stupid
edward
henry
was
in
comparison
with
the
enlightened
rest
of
us
why
he
protested
secretly
she
was
even
glad
to
meet
you
machin
she
said
awkwardly
in
a
weak
voice
with
a
peculiar
gesture
as
she
shook
hands
then
a
mechanical
nervous
giggle
and
then
silence
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
said
mr
seven
sachs
and
the
american
also
lapsed
into
silence
but
the
silence
of
mr
seven
sachs
was
different
from
rose
euclid
he
was
not
shy
a
dark
and
handsome
tranquil
youngish
man
with
a
redoubtable
square
chin
delicately
rounded
at
the
corners
he
strikingly
resembled
his
own
figure
on
the
stage
and
moreover
he
seemed
to
regard
silence
as
a
natural
and
proper
condition
he
simply
stood
in
a
graceful
posture
with
his
muscles
at
ease
and
waited
bryany
behind
seemed
to
be
reduced
in
stature
and
to
have
become
apologetic
for
himself
in
the
presence
of
greatness
still
bryany
did
say
something
said
bryany
sorry
to
hear
you
been
seedy
mr
machin
oh
yes
rose
euclid
blurted
out
as
if
shot
it
very
good
of
you
to
ask
us
up
here
mr
seven
sachs
concurred
adding
that
he
hoped
the
illness
was
not
serious
edward
henry
said
it
was
not
wo
you
sit
down
all
of
you
said
edward
henry
miss
er
euclid
they
all
sat
down
except
bryany
sit
down
bryany
said
edward
henry
i
glad
to
be
able
to
return
your
hospitality
at
the
turk
head
this
was
a
blow
for
bryany
who
obviously
felt
it
and
grew
even
more
apologetic
as
he
fumbled
with
assumed
sprightliness
at
a
chair
fancy
your
being
here
all
the
time
said
he
and
me
looked
for
you
everywhere
bryany
seven
sachs
interrupted
him
calmly
have
you
got
those
letters
off
not
yet
sir
seven
sachs
urbanely
smiled
i
think
we
ought
to
get
them
off
certainly
agreed
bryany
with
eagerness
and
moved
towards
the
door
here
the
key
of
my
seven
sachs
stopped
him
producing
a
key
bryany
by
a
mischance
catching
edward
henry
eye
as
he
took
the
key
blushed
in
a
moment
edward
henry
was
alone
with
the
two
silent
celebrities
well
said
edward
henry
to
himself
i
let
myself
in
for
it
this
time
no
mistake
what
in
the
name
of
common
sense
am
i
doing
here
rose
euclid
coughed
and
arranged
the
folds
of
her
dress
i
suppose
like
most
americans
you
see
all
the
sights
said
edward
henry
to
seven
sachs
the
five
towns
is
much
visited
by
americans
what
do
you
think
of
my
bully
said
seven
sachs
with
the
faintest
twinkle
and
rose
euclid
gave
the
mechanical
nervous
giggle
i
can
do
with
this
chap
thought
edward
henry
the
entered
with
the
supper
menu
thank
heaven
thought
edward
henry
rose
euclid
requested
to
order
a
supper
after
her
own
mind
stared
vaguely
at
the
menu
for
some
moments
and
then
said
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
order
artichokes
edward
henry
blandly
suggested
again
the
giggle
followed
this
time
by
a
flush
and
suddenly
edward
henry
recognized
in
her
the
entrancing
creature
of
fifteen
years
ago
her
head
thrown
back
she
had
put
her
left
hand
behind
her
and
was
groping
with
her
long
fingers
for
an
object
to
touch
having
found
at
length
the
arm
of
another
chair
she
drew
her
fingers
feverishly
along
its
surface
he
vividly
remembered
the
gesture
in
flower
of
the
heart
she
had
used
it
with
terrific
effect
at
every
grand
emotional
crisis
of
the
play
he
now
recognized
even
her
face
did
bryany
tell
you
that
my
two
boys
are
coming
up
said
she
i
left
them
behind
to
do
some
telephoning
for
me
delighted
said
edward
henry
the
more
the
merrier
and
he
hoped
that
he
spoke
true
but
her
two
boys
marrier
he
a
young
manager
i
do
know
whether
you
know
him
very
very
talented
and
carlo
trent
same
name
as
my
dog
edward
henry
indiscreetly
murmured
and
his
fancy
flew
back
to
the
home
he
had
quitted
and
wilkins
and
everybody
in
it
grew
transiently
unreal
to
him
delighted
he
said
again
he
was
relieved
that
her
two
boys
were
not
her
offspring
that
at
least
was
something
gained
know
the
dramatist
said
rose
euclid
apparently
disappointed
by
the
effect
on
edward
henry
of
the
name
of
carlo
trent
really
said
edward
henry
i
hope
he
wo
mind
me
being
in
a
the
obsequiously
restive
managed
to
choose
the
supper
himself
leaving
he
reached
the
door
just
in
time
to
hold
it
open
for
the
entrance
of
marrier
and
carlo
trent
who
were
talking
with
noticeable
freedom
and
emphasis
in
an
accent
which
in
the
five
towns
is
known
as
the
haw
haw
the
or
the
kensingtonian
accent
ii
within
ten
minutes
within
less
than
ten
minutes
alderman
edward
henry
machin
at
wilkins
was
so
wonderfully
changed
for
the
better
that
edward
henry
might
have
been
excused
for
not
recognizing
it
as
his
own
the
service
at
wilkins
where
they
profoundly
understood
human
nature
was
very
intelligent
somewhere
in
a
central
bureau
at
wilkins
sat
a
psychologist
who
knew
for
example
that
a
supper
commanded
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
must
be
produced
instantly
if
it
is
to
be
enjoyed
delay
in
these
capricious
cases
impairs
the
ecstasy
and
therefore
lessens
the
chance
of
other
similar
meals
being
commanded
at
the
same
establishment
hence
no
sooner
had
the
disappeared
with
the
order
than
certain
esquires
appeared
with
the
limbs
and
body
of
a
table
which
they
set
up
in
edward
henry
and
they
covered
the
board
with
a
damask
cloth
and
half
covered
the
damask
cloth
with
flowers
glasses
and
plates
and
laid
a
special
private
wire
from
the
near
the
hearth
to
a
spot
on
the
table
beneath
edward
henry
left
hand
so
that
he
could
summon
courtiers
on
the
slightest
provocation
with
the
minimum
of
exertion
then
immediately
brown
and
lemons
and
came
followed
by
oysters
followed
by
bottles
of
pale
wine
both
still
and
sparkling
thus
before
the
principal
dishes
had
even
begun
to
frizzle
in
the
distant
kitchens
the
revellers
were
under
the
illusion
that
the
entire
supper
was
waiting
just
outside
the
door
yes
they
were
revellers
now
for
the
advent
of
her
young
men
had
transformed
rose
euclid
and
rose
euclid
had
transformed
the
general
situation
at
the
table
edward
henry
occupied
one
side
of
it
mr
seven
sachs
occupied
the
side
opposite
marrier
the
very
very
talented
young
manager
occupied
the
side
to
edward
henry
left
and
rose
euclid
and
carlo
trent
together
occupied
the
side
to
his
right
trent
and
marrier
were
each
about
thirty
years
of
age
trent
with
a
deep
voice
had
extremely
lustrous
eyes
which
eyes
continually
dwelt
on
rose
euclid
in
admiration
apparently
all
she
needed
in
this
valley
was
oysters
and
admiration
and
she
now
had
both
in
unlimited
quantities
oysters
are
darlings
she
said
as
she
swallowed
the
first
carlo
trent
kissed
her
hand
respectfully
for
she
was
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
and
you
are
the
greatest
tragic
actress
in
the
world
said
he
in
the
kensingtonian
bass
a
few
moments
earlier
rose
euclid
had
whispered
to
edward
henry
that
carlo
trent
was
the
greatest
dramatic
poet
in
the
world
she
flowered
now
beneath
the
sun
of
those
dark
lustrous
eyes
and
the
soft
rain
of
that
admiration
from
the
greatest
dramatic
poet
in
the
world
it
really
did
seem
to
edward
henry
that
she
grew
younger
assuredly
she
grew
more
girlish
and
her
voice
improved
and
then
the
bottles
began
to
pop
and
it
was
as
though
the
action
of
uncorking
wine
automatically
uncorked
hearts
also
mr
seven
sachs
sitting
square
and
upright
smiled
gaily
at
edward
henry
across
the
gleaming
table
and
raised
a
glass
little
marrier
who
at
nearly
all
times
had
a
most
enthusiastic
smile
did
the
same
in
the
result
five
glasses
met
over
the
central
bed
of
chrysanthemums
edward
henry
was
happy
surrounded
by
enigmas
for
he
had
no
conception
whatever
why
rose
euclid
had
brought
any
of
the
three
men
to
his
table
he
was
nevertheless
uplifted
as
he
looked
about
him
at
the
rich
table
and
at
the
glittering
chandelier
overhead
albeit
the
lamps
thereof
were
inferior
to
his
own
and
at
the
expanses
of
soft
carpet
and
at
the
walls
and
at
the
voluptuous
curtains
and
at
the
couple
of
impeccable
gentlemen
and
at
joseph
who
knew
his
place
behind
his
master
chair
he
came
to
the
justifiable
conclusion
that
money
was
a
marvellous
thing
and
the
workings
of
commerce
mysterious
and
beautiful
he
had
invented
the
five
towns
thrift
club
working
men
and
their
wives
in
the
five
towns
were
paying
their
twopences
and
sixpences
and
shillings
weekly
into
his
club
and
finding
the
transaction
a
real
convenience
and
lo
he
was
entertaining
celebrities
at
wilkins
for
mind
you
they
were
celebrities
he
knew
seven
sachs
was
a
celebrity
because
he
had
verily
seen
him
act
and
act
very
well
in
his
own
play
and
because
his
name
in
letters
a
foot
high
had
dominated
all
the
hoardings
of
the
five
towns
as
for
rose
euclid
could
there
be
a
greater
celebrity
such
was
the
strange
power
of
the
popular
legend
concerning
her
that
even
now
despite
the
first
fearful
shock
of
disappointment
edward
henry
could
not
call
her
by
her
name
without
stumbling
over
it
without
a
curious
thrill
and
further
he
was
revising
his
judgment
of
her
as
well
as
lowering
her
age
slightly
on
coming
into
the
room
she
had
doubtless
been
almost
as
startled
as
himself
and
her
constrained
muteness
had
been
probably
due
to
a
guilty
feeling
in
the
matter
of
passing
too
open
remarks
to
a
friend
about
a
perfect
stranger
manner
of
eating
artichokes
the
which
supposition
flattered
him
by
the
way
he
wished
she
had
brought
the
young
friend
who
had
shared
her
amusement
over
his
artichokes
with
regard
to
the
other
two
men
he
was
quite
ready
to
believe
that
carlo
trent
was
the
world
greatest
dramatic
poet
and
to
admit
the
exceeding
talent
of
marrier
as
a
theatrical
manager
in
fact
unmistakable
celebrities
one
and
all
he
himself
was
a
celebrity
a
certain
quality
in
the
attitude
of
each
of
his
guests
showed
clearly
that
they
considered
him
a
celebrity
and
not
only
a
celebrity
but
a
card
bryany
must
have
been
talking
and
the
conviction
of
this
rendered
him
happy
his
magnificent
hunger
rendered
him
still
happier
and
the
reflection
that
brindley
owed
him
put
a
top
on
his
bliss
i
like
your
machin
said
carlo
trent
suddenly
after
his
first
spoonful
of
soup
then
i
need
apologize
for
it
edward
henry
replied
it
is
the
of
my
dreams
carlo
trent
went
on
well
said
edward
henry
as
we
on
the
subject
i
like
your
carlo
trent
was
wearing
a
soft
shirt
the
other
three
shirts
were
all
rigidly
starched
hitherto
edward
henry
had
imagined
that
a
fashionable
evening
shirt
should
be
before
aught
else
he
now
appreciated
the
distinction
of
a
frilled
and
gently
flowing
especially
when
a
broad
purple
eyeglass
ribbon
wandered
across
it
rose
euclid
gazed
in
modest
transport
at
carlo
chest
the
colour
carlo
proceeded
ignoring
edward
henry
compliment
the
colour
is
inspiring
so
is
the
texture
i
have
a
woman
delight
in
textures
i
could
certainly
produce
better
hexameters
in
such
a
although
edward
henry
owing
to
an
unfortunate
hiatus
in
his
education
did
not
know
what
a
hexameter
might
be
he
was
artist
enough
to
comprehend
the
effect
of
attire
on
creative
work
for
he
had
noticed
that
he
himself
could
make
more
money
in
one
necktie
than
in
another
and
he
would
instinctively
take
particular
care
in
the
morning
choice
of
a
cravat
on
days
when
he
meditated
a
great
coup
why
do
you
get
one
marrier
suggested
do
you
really
think
i
could
asked
carlo
trent
as
if
the
possibility
were
shimmering
far
out
of
his
reach
like
a
rainbow
rather
smiled
harrier
i
do
mind
laying
a
fiver
that
machin
came
from
drook
in
old
bond
street
but
instead
of
saying
old
he
said
ehoold
it
did
edward
henry
admitted
marrier
beamed
with
satisfaction
drook
you
say
murmured
carlo
trent
old
bond
street
and
wrote
down
the
information
on
his
shirt
cuff
rose
euclid
watched
him
write
yes
carlo
said
she
but
do
you
think
we
better
begin
to
talk
about
the
theatre
you
have
told
me
yet
if
you
got
hold
of
longay
on
the
of
course
we
got
hold
of
him
said
marrier
he
agrees
with
me
that
intellectual
is
a
better
name
for
it
rose
euclid
clapped
her
hands
i
so
glad
she
cried
now
what
do
think
of
it
as
a
name
machin
intellectual
theatre
you
see
it
most
important
we
should
settle
on
the
name
is
it
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
edward
henry
felt
a
wave
of
cold
in
the
small
of
his
back
and
also
a
sinking
away
of
the
nevertheless
quite
solid
chair
on
which
he
sat
he
had
more
than
the
typical
englishman
sane
distrust
of
that
morbid
word
his
attitude
towards
it
amounted
to
active
dislike
if
ever
he
used
it
he
would
on
no
account
use
it
alone
he
would
say
intellectual
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
with
an
air
of
pushing
violently
away
from
him
everything
that
the
phrase
implied
the
notion
of
baptizing
a
theatre
with
the
fearsome
word
horrified
him
still
he
had
to
maintain
his
nerve
and
his
repute
so
he
drank
some
champagne
and
smiled
nonchalantly
as
the
imperturbable
duellist
smiles
while
the
pistols
are
being
examined
well
he
murmured
you
see
marrier
broke
in
with
the
smile
ecstatic
almost
dancing
on
his
chair
there
no
use
in
compromise
compromise
is
and
always
has
been
the
curse
of
this
country
the
unintellectual
drahma
is
dead
dead
naoobody
can
deny
that
all
the
in
the
west
are
proclaiming
it
should
you
call
your
play
intellectual
mr
sachs
edward
henry
inquired
across
the
table
i
scarcely
know
said
mr
seven
sachs
calmly
i
know
i
played
it
myself
fifteen
hundred
and
two
times
and
that
saying
nothing
of
my
three
subsidiary
companies
on
the
road
what
sachs
play
asked
carlo
trent
fretfully
do
you
know
carlo
rose
euclid
patted
him
oh
i
never
seen
it
but
it
was
on
all
the
hoardings
i
never
read
the
hoardings
said
carlo
is
it
in
verse
no
it
is
mr
seven
sachs
briefly
responded
but
i
made
over
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
out
of
it
then
of
course
it
intellectual
asserted
marrier
positively
that
proves
it
i
very
sorry
i
not
seen
it
either
but
it
must
be
intellectual
the
day
of
the
unintellectual
drahma
is
over
the
people
wo
have
it
we
must
have
faith
in
the
people
and
we
show
our
faith
better
than
by
calling
our
theatre
by
its
proper
name
intellectual
theatre
theatre
thought
edward
henry
what
he
got
to
do
with
it
i
do
know
that
i
so
much
in
love
with
your
muttered
carlo
trent
you
protested
rose
euclid
shocked
of
course
i
not
said
carlo
i
told
you
before
and
i
tell
you
now
that
there
only
one
name
for
the
theatre
theatre
perhaps
you
right
rose
agreed
as
if
a
swift
revelation
had
come
to
her
yes
you
right
she
make
a
cheerful
sort
of
partner
for
a
fellow
thought
edward
henry
if
she
in
the
habit
of
changing
her
mind
like
that
every
thirty
seconds
his
appetite
had
gone
he
could
only
drink
naturally
i
right
are
we
going
to
open
with
my
play
and
my
play
in
verse
i
sure
you
agree
with
me
machin
that
there
is
no
real
drama
except
the
poetical
drama
edward
henry
was
entirely
at
a
loss
indeed
he
was
drowning
in
his
so
favourable
to
the
composition
of
hexameters
poetry
he
vaguely
breathed
yes
sir
said
carlo
trent
poetry
i
never
read
any
poetry
in
my
life
said
edward
henry
like
a
desperate
criminal
not
a
line
whereupon
carlo
trent
rose
up
from
his
seat
and
his
eyeglasses
dangled
in
front
of
him
machin
said
he
with
the
utmost
benevolence
this
is
the
most
interesting
thing
i
ever
come
across
do
you
know
you
precisely
the
man
i
always
been
wanting
to
meet
the
virgin
mind
the
clean
slate
do
you
know
you
precisely
the
man
that
it
my
ambition
to
write
for
it
very
kind
of
you
said
edward
henry
feebly
beaten
and
consciously
beaten
he
thought
miserably
what
would
nellie
think
if
she
saw
me
in
this
gang
carlo
trent
went
on
turning
to
rose
euclid
rose
will
you
recite
those
lines
of
nashe
rose
euclid
began
to
blush
that
bit
you
taught
me
the
day
before
yesterday
only
the
three
lines
no
more
they
are
the
very
essence
of
poetry
poetry
at
its
purest
we
see
the
effect
of
them
on
machin
we
just
see
it
the
ideal
opportunity
to
test
my
theory
now
there
a
good
girl
oh
i
ca
i
too
nervous
stammered
rose
you
can
and
you
must
said
carlo
gazing
at
her
in
homage
nobody
in
the
world
can
say
them
as
well
as
you
can
now
rose
euclid
stood
up
one
moment
carlo
stopped
her
there
too
much
light
we
ca
do
with
all
this
light
machin
do
you
mind
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
all
the
lights
were
extinguished
save
a
lamp
on
the
mantelpiece
and
in
the
disconcertingly
darkened
room
rose
euclid
turned
her
face
towards
the
ray
from
this
solitary
globe
her
hand
groped
out
behind
her
found
the
and
began
to
scratch
it
agitatedly
she
lifted
her
head
she
was
the
actress
impressive
and
subjugating
and
edward
henry
felt
her
power
then
she
intoned
brightness
falls
from
the
air
queens
have
died
young
and
fair
dust
hath
closed
helen
eye
and
she
ceased
and
sat
down
there
was
a
silence
vo
murmured
carlo
trent
murmured
marrier
edward
henry
in
the
gloom
caught
mr
seven
sachs
unalterable
observant
smile
across
the
table
well
mr
machin
said
carlo
trent
edward
henry
had
felt
a
tremor
at
the
vibrations
of
rose
voice
but
the
words
she
uttered
had
set
up
no
clear
image
in
his
mind
unless
it
might
be
of
some
solid
body
falling
from
the
air
or
of
a
young
woman
named
helen
walking
along
trafalgar
road
bursley
on
a
dusty
day
and
getting
the
dust
in
her
eyes
he
knew
not
what
to
answer
is
that
all
there
is
of
it
he
asked
at
length
carlo
trent
said
it
from
thomas
nashe
in
time
of
pestilence
the
closing
lines
of
the
verse
are
am
sick
i
must
die
lord
have
mercy
on
me
well
said
edward
henry
recovering
i
rather
like
the
end
i
think
the
end
very
appropriate
mr
seven
sachs
choked
over
his
wine
and
kept
on
choking
iii
marrier
was
the
first
to
recover
from
this
blow
to
the
prestige
of
poetry
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
honest
to
say
that
marrier
had
suffered
no
inconvenience
from
the
his
apparent
gleeful
zest
in
life
had
not
been
impaired
he
was
a
born
optimist
of
an
extreme
type
unknown
beyond
the
circumferences
of
theatrical
circles
i
he
emphasized
i
got
an
ideah
we
ought
to
be
photographed
like
that
do
you
no
end
of
good
he
glanced
encouragingly
at
rose
euclid
do
you
see
it
in
the
illustrated
papers
a
prayvate
at
wilkins
hotel
miss
euclid
reciting
verse
at
a
discussion
of
the
plans
for
her
new
theatre
in
piccadilly
circus
the
figures
reading
from
left
to
right
are
mr
seven
sachs
the
famous
miss
rose
euclid
carlo
trent
the
celebrated
dramatic
poet
alderman
machin
the
midlands
capitalist
and
so
on
marrier
repeated
and
so
on
it
a
notion
said
rose
euclid
dreamily
but
how
we
be
photographed
carlo
trent
demanded
with
irritation
perfectly
easy
now
in
ten
minutes
i
know
a
photographer
in
brook
street
would
he
come
at
once
carlo
trent
frowned
at
his
watch
rather
marrier
gaily
soothed
him
as
he
went
over
to
the
telephone
and
marrier
bright
boyish
face
radiated
forth
the
assurance
that
nothing
in
all
his
existence
had
more
completely
filled
him
with
sincere
joy
than
this
enterprise
of
procuring
a
photograph
of
the
party
even
in
giving
the
photographer
number
he
was
one
of
those
prodigies
who
remember
infallibly
all
telephone
numbers
his
voice
seemed
to
gloat
upon
his
project
and
while
marrier
having
obtained
communication
with
the
photographer
was
saying
gloriously
into
the
telephone
yes
wilkins
no
quite
private
i
got
miss
rose
euclid
here
and
mr
seven
sachs
while
marrier
was
thus
proceeding
with
his
list
of
star
attractions
edward
henry
was
thinking
new
theatre
now
it
was
a
few
minutes
back
midlands
capitalist
eh
oh
ah
he
drank
again
he
said
to
himself
i
had
all
i
can
digest
of
this
beastly
balloony
stuff
he
meant
the
champagne
if
i
finish
the
glass
i
bound
to
have
a
bad
night
and
he
finished
the
glass
and
planked
it
down
firmly
on
the
table
well
he
remarked
aloud
cheerfully
if
we
to
be
photographed
i
suppose
we
shall
want
a
bit
more
light
on
the
subject
joseph
sprang
to
the
switches
please
carlo
trent
raised
a
protesting
hand
the
switches
were
not
turned
in
the
beautiful
dimness
the
greatest
tragic
actress
in
the
world
and
the
greatest
dramatic
poet
in
the
world
gazed
at
each
other
seeking
and
finding
solace
in
mutual
esteem
i
suppose
it
would
do
to
call
it
the
euclid
theatre
rose
questioned
casually
without
moving
her
eyes
splendid
cried
marrier
from
the
telephone
it
all
depends
whether
there
are
enough
mathematical
students
in
london
to
fill
the
theatre
for
a
run
said
edward
henry
oh
think
so
murmured
rose
surprised
and
vaguely
puzzled
at
that
instant
edward
henry
might
have
rushed
from
the
room
and
taken
the
back
to
the
five
towns
and
never
any
more
have
ventured
into
the
perils
of
london
if
carlo
trent
had
not
turned
his
head
and
signified
by
a
curt
reluctant
laugh
that
he
saw
the
joke
for
edward
henry
could
no
longer
depend
on
mr
seven
sachs
mr
seven
sachs
had
to
take
the
greatest
pains
to
keep
the
muscles
of
his
face
in
strict
order
the
slightest
laxity
with
them
and
he
would
have
been
involved
in
another
and
more
serious
suffocation
no
said
carlo
trent
muses
theatre
is
the
only
possible
title
there
is
money
in
the
poetical
drama
he
looked
hard
at
edward
henry
as
though
to
stare
down
the
memory
of
the
failure
of
verse
i
do
want
money
i
hate
the
thought
of
money
but
money
is
the
only
proof
of
democratic
appreciation
and
that
is
what
i
need
and
what
every
artist
needs
do
you
think
there
money
in
the
poetical
drama
mr
sachs
not
in
america
said
sachs
london
is
a
queer
place
look
at
the
runs
of
stephen
phillips
plays
yes
i
only
reckon
to
know
america
look
at
what
pilgrim
made
out
of
shakspere
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
poetry
said
edward
henry
too
hastily
and
is
shakspere
poetry
carlo
trent
challenged
well
i
suppose
if
you
put
it
in
that
way
he
edward
henry
cautiously
admitted
humbled
he
was
under
the
disadvantage
of
never
having
either
seen
or
read
shakspere
his
sure
instinct
had
always
warned
him
against
being
drawn
into
shakspere
and
has
miss
euclid
ever
done
anything
finer
than
constance
i
do
know
edward
henry
pleaded
why
miss
euclid
in
john
i
never
saw
john
said
edward
henry
you
mean
to
expostulated
carlo
trent
in
italics
you
never
saw
rose
euclid
as
and
edward
henry
shaking
his
abashed
head
perceived
that
his
life
had
been
wasted
carlo
for
a
few
moments
grew
reflective
and
softer
it
one
of
my
earliest
and
most
precious
boyish
memories
he
murmured
as
he
examined
the
ceiling
it
must
have
been
in
eighteen
rose
euclid
abandoned
the
ice
with
which
she
had
just
been
served
and
by
a
single
gesture
drew
carlo
attention
away
from
the
ceiling
and
towards
the
fact
that
it
would
be
clumsy
on
his
part
to
indulge
further
in
the
chronology
of
her
career
she
began
to
blush
again
marrier
now
back
at
the
table
after
a
successful
expedition
beamed
over
his
ice
it
was
your
that
led
to
your
friendship
with
the
countess
of
chell
was
it
you
know
he
turned
to
edward
henry
miss
euclid
and
the
countess
are
virry
intimate
yes
i
know
said
edward
henry
rose
euclid
continued
to
blush
her
agitated
hand
scratched
the
back
of
the
chair
behind
her
even
sir
john
pilgrim
admits
i
can
act
shakspere
she
said
in
a
thick
mournful
voice
looking
at
the
cloth
as
she
pronounced
the
august
name
of
the
head
of
the
dramatic
profession
it
may
surprise
you
to
know
machin
that
about
a
month
ago
after
he
quarrelled
with
selina
gregory
sir
john
asked
me
if
i
care
to
star
with
him
on
his
shaksperean
tour
round
the
world
next
spring
and
i
said
i
would
if
he
include
carlo
poetical
play
orient
pearl
and
he
would
no
he
would
and
now
he
got
little
cora
pryde
she
is
and
she
going
to
play
juliet
can
you
imagine
such
a
thing
as
if
a
mere
girl
could
play
juliet
carlo
observed
the
mature
actress
with
deep
satisfaction
proud
of
her
and
proud
also
of
himself
i
would
go
with
pilgrim
now
exclaimed
rose
passionately
not
if
he
went
down
on
his
knees
to
me
and
nothing
on
earth
would
induce
me
to
let
him
have
orient
pearl
carlo
trent
asseverated
with
equal
passion
he
lost
that
for
ever
he
added
grimly
it
wo
be
he
who
collar
the
profits
out
of
that
it
just
be
ourselves
not
if
he
went
down
on
his
knees
to
me
rose
was
repeating
to
herself
with
fervency
the
calm
of
despair
took
possession
of
edward
henry
he
felt
that
he
must
act
immediately
he
knew
his
own
mood
by
long
experience
exploring
the
pockets
of
the
which
had
aroused
the
longing
of
the
greatest
dramatic
poet
in
the
world
he
discovered
in
one
of
them
precisely
the
piece
of
apparatus
he
required
namely
a
slip
of
paper
suitable
for
writing
it
was
a
carbon
duplicate
of
the
bill
for
the
and
showed
the
word
drook
in
massive
printed
black
and
the
figures
in
faint
blue
he
drew
a
pencil
from
his
waistcoat
and
inscribed
on
the
paper
go
out
and
then
come
back
in
a
couple
of
minutes
and
tell
me
someone
wants
to
speak
to
me
urgently
in
the
next
room
with
a
minimum
of
ostentation
he
gave
the
document
to
joseph
who
evidently
well
trained
under
sir
nicholas
vanished
into
the
next
room
before
attempting
to
read
it
i
hope
said
edward
henry
to
carlo
trent
that
this
play
is
reserved
for
the
new
theatre
utterly
said
carlo
trent
with
miss
euclid
in
the
principal
part
rather
sang
marrier
rather
i
shall
never
never
appear
at
any
other
theatre
mr
machin
said
rose
with
tragic
emotion
once
more
feeling
with
her
fingers
along
the
back
of
her
chair
so
i
hope
the
building
will
begin
at
once
in
less
than
six
months
we
ought
to
open
easily
sang
the
optimist
joseph
returned
to
the
room
and
sought
his
master
attention
in
a
whisper
what
is
it
edward
henry
asked
irritably
speak
up
a
gentleman
wishes
to
know
if
he
can
speak
to
you
in
the
next
room
sir
well
he
ca
he
said
it
was
urgent
sir
scowling
edward
henry
rose
excuse
me
he
said
i
wo
be
a
moment
help
yourselves
to
the
liqueurs
you
chaps
can
go
i
fancy
the
last
remark
was
addressed
to
the
the
next
room
was
the
vast
bedroom
with
two
beds
in
it
edward
henry
closed
the
door
carefully
and
drew
the
across
it
then
he
listened
no
sound
penetrated
from
the
scene
of
the
supper
there
a
telephone
in
this
room
is
there
he
said
to
joseph
oh
yes
there
it
is
well
you
can
go
yes
sir
edward
henry
sat
down
on
one
of
the
beds
by
the
hook
on
which
hung
the
telephone
and
he
cogitated
upon
the
characteristics
of
certain
members
of
the
party
which
he
had
just
left
i
a
mind
am
i
he
thought
i
a
slate
well
their
notion
of
business
is
to
begin
by
discussing
the
name
of
the
theatre
and
they
have
even
taken
up
the
option
ye
gods
orient
pearl
and
she
fifty
that
i
swear
not
a
word
yet
of
real
business
not
one
word
he
may
be
a
poet
i
daresay
he
is
a
conceited
ass
why
even
bryany
was
better
than
that
lot
only
sachs
turned
bryany
out
i
like
sachs
but
he
wo
open
his
mouth
well
they
spoilt
my
appetite
and
i
hate
champagne
the
poet
hates
money
no
he
the
thought
of
money
and
she
changing
her
mind
the
whole
blessed
time
a
month
ago
have
gone
over
to
pilgrim
and
the
poet
too
like
a
photographed
indeed
the
bally
photographer
will
be
here
in
a
minute
they
take
me
for
a
fool
or
do
they
know
any
better
anyhow
i
am
a
fool
i
must
teach
summat
he
seized
the
telephone
hello
he
said
into
it
i
want
you
to
put
me
on
to
the
of
suite
no
please
who
oh

in
the
bedroom
of
suite
no
machin
alderman
machin
thanks

he
waited
then
he
heard
harrier
kensingtonian
voice
in
the
telephone
asking
who
he
was
is
that
machin
room
he
continued
imitating
with
a
broad
farcical
effect
the
acute
kensingtonianism
of
marrier
tones
is
miss
euclid
there
oh
she
is
well
you
tell
her
that
sir
john
pilgrim
private
secretary
wishes
to
speak
to
her
thanks
all
right
hold
the
line
a
pause
then
he
heard
rose
voice
in
the
telephone
and
he
resumed
miss
euclid
yes

john
pilgrim

him
at
what
oh
at
his
house
yes
i
mean
flat
flat
i
said
flat
you
think
you
could
pause
he
could
hear
her
calling
to
carlo
trent
thanks
no
i
do
know
exactly
he
went
on
again
but
i
know
the
arrangement
with
miss
pryde
is
broken
off
and
sir
john
wants
a
play
at
once
he
told
me
that
at
once
yes
orient
pearl
that
was
the
title
at
the
royal
first
and
then
the
world
tour
fifteen
months
at
least
in
all
so
i
gathered
of
course
i
do
speak
officially
well
many
thanks
saoo
good
of
you
i
tell
sir
john
it
arranged
he
hung
up
the
telephone
the
excited
eager
effusive
tones
of
rose
euclid
remained
in
his
ears
aware
of
a
strange
phenomenon
on
his
forehead
he
touched
it
he
was
perspiring
i
teach
a
thing
or
two
he
muttered
and
again
serves
her
right
never
appear
at
any
other
theatre
mr
machin
knees
cheerful
partners
oh
cheerful
partners
he
returned
to
his
nobody
said
a
word
about
the
telephoning
but
rose
euclid
and
carlo
trent
looked
even
more
like
conspirators
than
they
did
before
and
marrier
joy
in
life
seemed
to
be
just
the
least
bit
diminished
so
sorry
edward
henry
began
hurriedly
and
without
consulting
the
poet
wishes
subtly
turned
on
all
the
lights
now
do
you
think
we
better
discuss
the
question
of
taking
up
the
option
you
know
it
expires
on
friday
no
said
rose
euclid
girlishly
it
expires
that
why
it
so
we
got
hold
of
you
but
bryany
told
me
friday
and
the
date
was
clear
enough
on
the
copy
of
the
option
he
gave
me
a
mistake
of
copying
beamed
marrier
however
it
all
right
well
observed
edward
henry
with
heartiness
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
for
sheer
calm
coolness
you
take
the
cake
however
as
marrier
so
ably
says
it
all
right
now
i
understand
if
i
go
into
this
affair
i
can
count
on
you
absolutely
and
also
on
services
he
tried
to
talk
as
if
he
had
been
diplomatizing
with
actresses
and
poets
all
his
life
a
absolutely
said
rose
and
carlo
trent
nodded
you
iscariots
edward
henry
addressed
them
in
the
silence
of
the
brain
behind
his
smile
you
iscariots
the
photographer
arrived
with
certain
cases
and
at
once
rose
euclid
and
carlo
trent
began
instinctively
to
pose
to
think
edward
henry
pleasantly
reflected
that
they
are
hugging
themselves
because
sir
john
pilgrim
secretary
happened
to
telephone
just
while
i
was
out
of
the
room
chapter
v
mr
sachs
talks
i
it
was
the
sudden
flash
of
the
photographer
magnesium
light
plainly
felt
by
him
through
his
closed
lids
that
somehow
instantly
inspired
edward
henry
to
a
definite
and
ruthless
line
of
action
he
opened
his
eyes
and
beheld
the
triumphant
group
and
the
photographer
himself
victorious
over
even
the
triumphant
in
a
superb
pose
that
suggested
that
all
distinguished
mankind
in
his
presence
was
naught
but
food
for
the
conquering
camera
the
photographer
smiled
indulgently
and
his
smile
said
having
been
photographed
by
me
you
have
each
of
you
reached
the
summit
of
your
career
be
content
retire
die
destiny
is
accomplished
machin
said
rose
euclid
i
do
believe
your
eyes
were
shut
so
do
i
edward
henry
curtly
agreed
but
you
spoil
the
group
not
a
bit
of
it
said
edward
henry
i
always
shut
my
eyes
when
being
photographed
by
i
open
my
mouth
instead
so
long
as
something
open
what
does
it
matter
the
truth
was
that
only
in
the
nick
of
time
had
he
by
a
happy
miracle
of
ingenuity
invented
a
way
of
ruining
the
photograph
the
absolute
necessity
for
its
ruin
had
presented
itself
to
him
rather
late
in
the
proceedings
when
the
photographer
had
already
finished
arranging
the
hands
and
shoulders
of
everybody
in
an
artistic
pattern
the
photograph
had
to
be
spoilt
for
the
imperative
reason
that
his
mother
though
she
never
read
a
newspaper
did
as
a
fact
look
at
a
daily
which
from
pride
she
insisted
on
paying
for
out
of
her
own
purse
at
the
rate
of
one
halfpenny
a
day
now
daily
specialized
in
theatrical
photographs
on
which
it
said
it
spent
large
sums
of
money
and
edward
henry
in
a
vision
had
seen
the
historic
group
in
a
future
issue
of
the
he
had
also
in
the
same
vision
seen
his
mother
conning
the
said
issue
and
the
sardonic
curve
of
her
lips
as
she
recognized
her
son
therein
and
he
had
even
heard
her
dry
cynical
contemptuous
exclamation
bless
us
he
could
never
have
looked
squarely
in
his
mother
face
again
if
that
group
had
appeared
in
her
chosen
organ
her
silent
and
grim
scorn
would
have
crushed
his
to
a
miserable
hopeless
pulp
hence
his
resolve
to
render
the
photograph
impossible
perhaps
i
better
take
another
one
the
photographer
suggested
though
i
think
er
machin
was
all
right
at
the
supreme
crisis
the
man
had
been
too
busy
with
his
fireworks
to
keep
a
watch
on
every
separate
eye
and
mouth
of
the
assemblage
of
course
i
was
all
right
said
edward
henry
almost
with
brutality
please
take
that
thing
away
as
quickly
as
you
can
we
have
business
to
attend
to
yes
sir
agreed
the
photographer
no
longer
victorious
edward
henry
rang
his
bell
and
two
arrived
clear
this
table
immediately
the
tone
of
the
command
startled
everybody
except
the
and
mr
seven
sachs
rose
euclid
gave
vent
to
her
nervous
giggle
the
poet
and
marrier
tried
to
appear
detached
and
dignified
and
succeeded
in
appearing
guiltily
confused
for
which
they
contemned
themselves
despite
this
volition
the
glances
of
all
three
of
them
too
clearly
signified
this
capitalist
must
be
humoured
he
has
an
unlimited
supply
of
actual
cash
and
therefore
he
has
the
right
to
be
peculiar
moreover
we
know
that
he
is
a
card
and
curiously
edward
henry
himself
was
deriving
great
force
of
character
from
the
simple
reflection
that
he
had
indeed
a
lot
of
money
real
available
money
his
to
do
utterly
as
he
liked
with
it
hidden
in
a
secret
place
in
that
very
room
i
show
what
what
he
privately
mused
celebrities
or
not
i
show
if
they
think
they
can
come
it
over
me
it
was
i
regret
to
say
the
state
of
mind
of
a
bully
such
is
the
noxious
influence
of
excessive
coin
he
reproached
the
greatest
actress
and
the
greatest
dramatic
poet
for
deceiving
him
and
quite
ignored
the
nevertheless
fairly
obvious
fact
that
he
had
first
deceived
them
now
then
he
began
with
something
of
the
pomposity
of
a
chairman
at
a
directors
meeting
as
soon
as
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
the
room
emptied
of
and
photographer
and
photographic
apparatus
let
us
see
exactly
where
we
stand
he
glanced
specially
at
rose
euclid
who
with
an
air
of
deep
business
acumen
returned
the
glance
yes
she
eagerly
replied
as
one
seeking
after
righteousness
let
see
the
option
must
be
taken
up
good
that
clear
it
came
rather
but
it
now
clear
has
to
be
paid
down
to
buy
the
existing
building
on
the
land
and
so
on
eh
yes
of
course
bryany
told
you
all
that
did
he
said
rose
brightly
bryany
did
tell
me
edward
henry
admitted
sternly
but
if
bryany
can
make
a
mistake
in
the
day
of
the
week
he
might
make
a
mistake
in
a
few
noughts
at
the
end
of
a
sum
of
money
suddenly
mr
seven
sachs
startled
them
all
by
emerging
from
his
silence
with
the
words
the
figure
is
instinctively
edward
henry
waited
for
more
but
no
more
came
mr
seven
sachs
was
one
of
those
rare
and
disconcerting
persons
who
do
not
keep
on
talking
after
they
have
finished
he
resumed
his
tranquillity
he
into
his
silence
with
no
symptom
of
entirely
cheerful
and
at
ease
and
edward
henry
was
aware
of
his
observant
and
steady
gaze
edward
henry
said
to
himself
this
man
is
expecting
me
to
behave
in
a
remarkable
way
bryany
has
been
telling
him
all
about
me
and
he
is
waiting
to
see
if
i
really
am
as
good
as
my
reputation
i
have
just
got
to
be
as
good
as
my
reputation
he
looked
up
at
the
electric
chandelier
almost
with
regret
that
it
was
not
gas
one
can
not
light
one
cigarette
by
twisting
a
and
sticking
it
into
an
electric
chandelier
moreover
there
were
some
thousands
of
matches
on
the
table
still
further
he
had
done
the
trick
once
for
all
a
card
must
not
repeat
himself
this
money
edward
henry
proceeded
has
to
be
paid
to
slossons
lord
woldo
solicitors
wednesday
rain
or
shine
he
finished
the
phrase
on
a
note
of
interrogation
and
as
nobody
offered
any
reply
he
rapped
on
the
table
and
repeated
rain
or
shine
yes
said
rose
euclid
leaning
timidly
forward
and
taking
a
cigarette
from
a
gold
case
that
lay
on
the
table
all
her
movements
indicated
an
earnest
desire
to
be
thoroughly
so
that
miss
euclid
edward
henry
continued
impressively
but
with
a
wilful
touch
of
incredulity
you
are
in
a
position
to
pay
your
share
of
this
money
certainly
said
miss
euclid
and
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
aggrieved
can
you
doubt
my
honour
morning
that
is
to
say
morning
you
will
have
in
actual
cash
coin
notes
actually
in
your
possession
miss
euclid
disengaged
hand
was
feeling
out
behind
her
again
for
some
surface
upon
which
to
express
its
emotion
and
hers
well
she
stopped
flushing
these
people
are
astounding
edward
henry
reflected
like
a
god
she
not
got
the
money
i
knew
it
it
like
this
machin
marrier
began
excuse
me
marrier
edward
henry
turned
on
him
determined
if
he
could
to
eliminate
the
optimism
from
that
beaming
face
any
friend
of
miss
euclid
is
welcome
here
but
you
already
talked
about
this
theatre
as
and
i
just
want
to
know
where
you
come
in
where
i
come
in
marrier
smiled
absolutely
unperturbed
miss
euclid
has
appointed
me
general
manajah
at
what
salary
if
it
is
a
rude
question
oh
we
have
settled
details
yet
you
see
the
theatre
is
built
yet
true
said
edward
henry
i
was
forgetting
i
was
thinking
for
the
moment
that
the
theatre
was
all
ready
and
going
to
be
opened
night
with
orient
pearl
have
you
had
much
experience
of
managing
theatres
marrier
i
suppose
you
have
eho
yes
exclaimed
marrier
i
began
life
as
a
lawyah
clerk
but
so
did
i
edward
henry
interjected
how
interesting
rose
euclid
murmured
with
fervency
after
puffing
forth
a
long
shaft
of
smoke
however
i
threw
it
up
marrier
went
on
i
did
said
edward
henry
i
got
thrown
out
strange
that
in
that
moment
he
was
positively
proud
of
having
been
dismissed
from
his
first
situation
strange
that
all
the
company
too
thought
the
better
of
him
for
having
been
dismissed
strange
that
marrier
regretted
that
he
also
had
not
been
dismissed
but
so
it
was
the
possession
of
much
ready
money
emits
a
peculiar
effluence
in
both
directions
back
to
the
past
forward
into
the
future
i
threw
it
up
said
marrier
because
the
stage
had
an
irresistible
attraction
for
me
i
been
for
an
amateur
company
you
knaoo
i
found
a
shop
as
of
a
company
touring
tom
cabin
i
stuck
to
that
for
six
years
and
then
i
threw
that
up
too
then
i
managed
one
of
miss
euclid
provincial
tours
and
since
i
met
our
friend
trent
i
had
the
chance
to
show
what
my
ideas
about
really
are
i
fancy
my
production
of
play
wo
be
forgotten
in
a
hurry
you
know
nymph
you
read
about
it
did
you
i
did
not
said
edward
henry
how
long
did
it
run
oh
it
did
run
it
was
put
on
for
a
run
it
was
part
of
one
of
the
sunday
night
shows
of
the
society
at
the
court
theatre
most
intellectual
people
in
london
you
know
no
such
audience
anywhere
else
in
the
wahld
his
rather
chubby
face
glistened
and
shimmered
with
enthusiasm
you
bet
he
added
but
that
was
only
by
the
way
my
real
game
is
management
general
management
and
i
think
i
may
say
i
know
what
it
is
evidently
edward
henry
concurred
but
shall
you
have
to
give
up
any
other
engagement
in
order
to
take
charge
of
the
muses
theatre
because
if
so
marrier
replied
no
edward
henry
observed
oh
but
said
marrier
reassuringly
if
necessary
i
would
throw
up
any
engagement
you
understand
me
any
in
favour
of
the
intellectual
theatah
as
i
prefer
to
call
it
you
see
as
i
own
part
of
the
option
by
these
last
words
edward
henry
was
confounded
even
to
muteness
i
forgot
to
mention
machin
said
rose
euclid
very
quickly
i
disposed
of
a
quarter
of
my
half
of
the
option
to
marrier
he
fully
agreed
with
me
it
was
better
that
he
should
have
a
proper
interest
in
the
theatre
why
of
course
cried
harrier
uplifted
let
me
see
said
edward
henry
after
a
long
breath
a
quarter
that
makes
it
that
you
have
to
find
mr
marrier
yes
morning
you
be
all
right
well
i
wo
swear
for
the
morning
but
i
shall
turn
up
with
the
stuff
in
the
afternoon
anyhow
i
two
men
in
tow
and
one
of
a
certainty
which
i
do
know
which
said
marrier
you
may
count
on
yours
sincerely
mr
machin
there
was
a
pause
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
rose
euclid
smiled
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
trent
is
also
one
of
our
partners
he
has
taken
another
quarter
of
my
half
edward
henry
controlled
himself
excellent
said
he
with
glee
trent
money
all
ready
too
i
am
providing
most
of
it
temporarily
said
rose
euclid
i
see
then
i
understand
you
have
your
three
quarters
of
all
ready
in
hand
she
glanced
at
mr
seven
sachs
have
i
mr
sachs
and
sachs
after
an
instant
hesitation
bowed
in
assent
sachs
is
not
exactly
going
into
the
speculation
but
he
is
lending
us
money
on
the
security
of
our
interests
that
the
way
to
put
it
is
it
mr
sachs
sachs
once
more
bowed
and
edward
henry
exclaimed
now
i
really
do
see
he
gave
one
glance
across
the
table
at
mr
seven
sachs
as
who
should
say
and
have
you
too
allowed
yourself
to
be
dragged
into
this
affair
i
really
thought
you
were
cleverer
do
you
agree
with
me
that
we
both
fools
of
the
most
arrant
description
and
under
that
brief
glance
mr
seven
sachs
calm
deserted
him
as
it
had
never
deserted
him
on
the
stage
where
for
over
fifteen
hundred
nights
he
had
withstood
the
menace
of
revolvers
poison
and
female
treachery
through
three
hours
and
four
acts
without
a
single
moment
of
agitation
apparently
miss
rose
euclid
could
exercise
a
siren
charm
upon
nearly
all
sorts
of
men
but
edward
henry
knew
one
sort
of
men
upon
whom
she
could
not
exercise
it
namely
the
sort
of
men
who
are
born
and
bred
in
the
five
towns
his
instinctive
belief
in
the
five
towns
as
the
sole
cradle
of
hard
practical
common
sense
was
never
stronger
than
just
now
you
might
by
wiles
get
the
better
of
london
and
america
but
not
of
the
five
towns
if
rose
euclid
were
to
go
around
and
about
the
five
towns
trying
to
do
the
siren
business
she
would
pretty
soon
discover
that
she
was
up
against
something
rather
special
in
the
way
of
human
nature
why
the
probability
was
that
these
three
rose
euclid
only
a
few
hours
since
a
glorious
name
and
legend
to
him
carlo
trent
and
marrier
could
not
at
that
moment
produce
even
ten
pounds
between
them
and
marrier
offering
to
lay
fivers
he
scornfully
pitied
them
and
he
was
not
altogether
without
pity
for
seven
sachs
who
had
doubtless
succeeded
in
life
by
sheer
accident
and
knew
no
more
than
an
infant
what
to
do
with
his
money
ii
well
said
edward
henry
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
decided
please
do
rose
euclid
entreated
him
i
decided
to
make
you
a
present
of
my
half
of
the
option
but
are
you
going
in
with
us
exclaimed
rose
no
madam
but
bryany
told
us
positively
you
were
he
said
it
was
all
arranged
bryany
ought
to
be
more
careful
said
edward
henry
if
he
does
mind
he
be
telling
a
downright
lie
some
day
but
you
bought
half
the
option
well
said
edward
henry
reasoning
what
an
option
what
does
it
mean
it
means
you
are
free
to
take
something
or
leave
it
leaving
it
but
why
demanded
marrier
gloomier
carlo
trent
played
with
his
eyeglasses
and
said
not
a
word
why
edward
henry
replied
simply
because
i
feel
i
not
fitted
for
the
job
i
do
know
enough
i
do
understand
i
should
go
the
right
way
about
the
affair
for
instance
i
should
never
have
guessed
by
myself
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
settle
the
name
of
the
theatre
before
you
got
the
lease
of
the
land
you
going
to
build
it
on
then
i
i
hate
leaving
things
to
the
last
moment
but
seemingly
there
only
one
proper
moment
in
these
theatrical
affairs
and
that
the
very
last
i
afraid
there
be
too
much
trusting
in
providence
for
my
taste
i
believe
in
trusting
in
providence
but
i
ca
bear
to
see
providence
overworked
and
i
never
even
tried
to
be
intellectual
and
i
a
bit
frightened
of
poetry
plays
but
you
not
read
my
play
carlo
trent
mutteringly
protested
that
is
so
admitted
edward
henry
will
you
read
it
trent
said
edward
henry
i
not
so
young
as
i
was
we
ruined
sighed
rose
euclid
with
a
tragic
gesture
ruined
edward
henry
took
her
up
smiling
nobody
is
ruined
who
knows
where
he
can
get
a
square
meal
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
know
where
you
going
to
lunch
and
he
looked
hard
at
her
it
was
a
blow
she
blenched
under
it
oh
yes
she
said
with
her
giggle
i
know
that
well
you
just
do
he
answered
her
in
his
heart
you
think
you
going
to
lunch
with
john
pilgrim
and
you
are
and
it
serves
you
right
besides
he
continued
aloud
how
can
you
say
you
ruined
when
making
you
a
present
of
something
that
i
paid
for
but
where
am
i
to
find
the
other
half
of
the
money
she
burst
out
we
were
depending
absolutely
on
you
for
it
if
i
do
get
it
the
option
will
be
lost
and
the
option
very
valuable
all
the
easier
to
find
the
money
then
what
in
less
than
hours
it
ca
be
done
i
get
it
in
all
london
marrier
will
get
it
for
you
one
of
his
certainties
edward
henry
smiled
in
the
five
towns
manner
i
you
knaoo
said
marrier
brightening
to
full
hope
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
but
rose
euclid
only
shook
her
head
mr
seven
sachs
then
edward
henry
suggested
i
should
have
been
delighted
said
sachs
with
the
most
perfect
gracious
tranquillity
but
i
can
not
find
another
i
shall
just
speak
to
that
mr
bryany
said
rose
euclid
in
the
accents
of
homicide
i
think
you
ought
to
edward
henry
concurred
but
that
wo
help
things
i
feel
a
little
responsible
especially
to
a
lady
you
have
a
quarter
of
the
whole
option
left
in
your
hands
miss
euclid
i
pay
you
at
the
same
rate
as
bryany
sold
to
me
i
gave
for
half
your
quarter
is
therefore
worth
well
i
pay
you
and
then
what
then
let
the
whole
affair
slide
but
that
wo
help
me
to
my
theatre
rose
euclid
said
pouting
she
was
now
decidedly
less
unhappy
than
her
face
pretended
because
edward
henry
had
reminded
her
of
sir
john
pilgrim
and
she
had
dreams
of
for
herself
and
for
carlo
trent
play
she
was
almost
glad
to
be
rid
of
all
the
worry
of
the
horrid
little
prospective
theatre
i
have
cooed
edward
henry
softly
her
head
sank
edward
henry
rose
in
the
incomparable
yellow
and
walked
to
and
fro
a
little
and
then
from
his
secret
store
he
produced
a
bundle
of
notes
and
counted
out
five
tens
and
coming
behind
rose
stretched
out
his
arm
and
laid
the
treasure
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
under
the
brilliant
chandelier
i
do
want
you
to
feel
you
have
anything
against
me
he
cooed
still
more
softly
silence
reigned
edward
henry
resumed
his
chair
and
gazed
at
rose
euclid
she
was
quite
a
dozen
years
older
than
his
wife
and
she
looked
more
than
a
dozen
years
older
she
had
no
fixed
home
no
husband
no
children
no
regular
situation
she
accepted
the
homage
of
young
men
who
were
cleverer
than
herself
save
in
one
important
respect
she
was
always
in
and
out
of
restaurants
and
hotels
and
express
trains
she
was
always
committing
hygienic
indiscretions
she
could
not
refrain
from
a
certain
girlishness
which
having
regard
to
her
years
her
waist
and
her
complexion
was
ridiculous
his
wife
would
have
been
afraid
of
her
and
would
have
despised
her
simultaneously
she
was
coarsened
by
the
continual
gaze
of
the
gaping
public
no
two
women
could
possibly
be
more
utterly
dissimilar
than
rose
euclid
and
the
cloistered
nellie
and
yet
as
rose
hesitant
fingers
closed
on
the
with
a
gesture
of
relief
edward
henry
had
an
agreeable
and
kindly
sensation
that
all
women
were
alike
after
all
in
the
need
of
a
shield
a
protection
a
strong
and
generous
male
hand
he
was
touched
by
the
spectacle
of
rose
euclid
as
naïve
as
any
young
lass
when
confronted
by
actual
and
he
was
touched
also
by
the
thought
of
nellie
and
the
children
afar
off
existing
in
comfort
and
peace
but
utterly
wistfully
dependent
on
himself
and
what
about
me
growled
carlo
trent
you
the
fellow
was
only
a
poet
he
negligently
dropped
him
five
fivers
his
share
of
the
option
value
marrier
said
nothing
but
his
eye
met
edward
henry
and
in
silence
five
fivers
were
meted
out
to
marrier
also
it
was
so
easy
to
delight
these
persons
who
apparently
seldom
set
eyes
on
real
ready
money
you
might
sign
receipts
all
of
you
just
as
a
matter
of
form
said
edward
henry
a
little
later
the
three
associates
were
off
as
we
both
in
the
hotel
sachs
said
edward
henry
you
might
stay
for
a
chat
and
a
drink
mr
seven
sachs
politely
agreed
edward
henry
accompanied
the
trio
of
worshippers
and
worshipped
to
the
door
of
his
suite
but
no
further
because
of
his
rose
euclid
had
assumed
a
resplendent
they
rang
imperially
for
the
lift
lackeys
bowed
humbly
before
them
they
spoke
of
and
other
luxuries
they
were
perfectly
at
home
in
the
grandeur
of
the
hotel
as
the
illuminated
lift
carried
them
down
out
of
sight
their
smiling
heads
disappearing
last
they
seemed
exactly
like
persons
of
extreme
wealth
and
indeed
for
the
moment
they
were
wealthy
they
had
parted
with
certain
hopes
but
they
had
had
a
windfall
and
two
of
them
were
looking
forward
with
absolute
assurance
to
a
profitable
meal
and
deal
with
sir
john
pilgrim
on
the
morrow
funny
place
london
said
the
provincial
to
himself
as
he
his
suite
to
rejoin
mr
seven
sachs
iii
well
sir
said
mr
seven
sachs
i
have
to
thank
you
for
getting
me
out
of
a
very
unsatisfactory
situation
did
you
really
want
to
get
out
of
it
asked
edward
henry
sachs
replied
simply
i
did
sir
there
were
too
many
partners
for
my
taste
they
were
seated
more
familiarly
now
in
the
being
indeed
separated
only
by
a
small
table
upon
which
were
glasses
and
whereas
on
a
night
in
the
previous
week
edward
henry
had
been
entertained
by
bryany
in
a
private
parlour
at
the
turk
head
hanbridge
on
this
night
he
was
in
a
sort
repaying
the
welcome
to
bryany
master
in
a
private
parlour
at
wilkins
london
the
sole
difference
in
favour
of
bryany
was
that
while
bryany
provided
cigarettes
and
whisky
edward
henry
was
providing
only
cigarettes
and
vichy
water
mr
seven
sachs
had
said
that
he
never
took
whisky
and
though
edward
henry
passion
for
vichy
water
was
not
quite
ungovernable
he
thought
well
to
give
rein
to
it
on
the
present
occasion
having
read
somewhere
that
vichy
water
placated
the
stomach
joseph
had
been
instructed
to
retire
and
not
only
that
resumed
mr
seven
sachs
but
you
got
a
very
good
thing
entirely
into
your
own
hands
masterly
sir
masterly
why
at
the
end
you
positively
had
the
air
of
doing
them
a
favour
you
made
them
believe
you
doing
them
a
favour
and
do
you
think
i
was
sachs
reflected
and
then
laughed
you
were
he
said
that
the
beauty
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
you
were
getting
away
with
the
goods
it
was
by
sheer
instinct
and
not
by
learning
that
edward
henry
fully
grasped
as
he
did
the
deep
significance
of
the
american
idiom
employed
by
mr
seven
sachs
he
too
laughed
as
sachs
had
laughed
he
was
immeasurably
flattered
he
had
not
been
so
flattered
since
the
countess
of
chell
had
permitted
him
to
offer
her
china
tea
meringues
and
berlin
pancakes
at
the
sub
rosa
in
hanbridge
and
that
was
a
very
long
time
ago
you
really
think
it
a
good
thing
edward
henry
ventured
for
he
had
not
yet
been
convinced
of
the
entire
goodness
of
theatrical
enterprise
near
piccadilly
circus
mr
seven
sachs
convinced
him
not
by
argument
but
by
the
sincerity
of
his
gestures
and
tones
for
it
was
impossible
to
question
that
mr
seven
sachs
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
the
shape
of
mr
seven
sachs
chin
was
alone
enough
to
prove
that
sachs
was
incapable
of
a
mere
ignorant
effervescence
everything
about
sachs
was
persuasive
and
his
long
silences
had
the
easy
vigour
of
oratory
and
they
served
also
to
make
his
speech
peculiarly
impressive
moreover
he
was
a
handsome
and
a
dark
man
and
probably
half
a
dozen
years
younger
than
edward
henry
and
the
discipline
of
had
taught
him
the
skill
to
be
forever
graceful
and
his
smile
rare
enough
was
that
of
a
boy
of
course
said
he
if
miss
euclid
and
the
others
had
had
any
sense
they
might
have
done
very
well
for
themselves
if
you
ask
me
the
option
alone
is
worth
ten
thousand
dollars
but
then
they
have
any
sense
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
so
you
advise
me
to
go
ahead
with
the
affair
on
my
own
mr
seven
sachs
his
black
eyes
twinkling
leaned
forward
and
became
rather
intimately
humorous
you
look
as
if
you
wanted
advice
do
you
said
he
i
suppose
i
do
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
agreed
edward
henry
with
a
most
admirable
quizzicalness
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
really
meant
to
go
ahead
with
the
affair
being
in
truth
a
little
doubtful
of
his
capacity
to
handle
it
but
mr
seven
sachs
was
all
unconsciously
forcing
edward
henry
to
believe
in
his
own
capacities
and
the
two
as
it
were
suddenly
developed
a
more
cordial
friendliness
each
felt
the
quick
lifting
of
the
plane
of
their
relations
and
was
aware
of
a
pleasurable
emotion
i
moving
onwards
gently
onwards
crooned
edward
henry
to
himself
what
price
brindley
and
his
now
londoners
might
call
him
a
provincial
and
undoubtedly
would
call
him
a
provincial
he
admitted
even
that
he
felt
like
a
provincial
in
the
streets
of
london
and
yet
here
he
was
doing
londoners
in
the
eye
all
over
the
place
and
receiving
the
open
homage
of
mr
seven
sachs
whose
name
was
the
basis
of
a
cosmopolitan
legend
and
now
he
made
the
cardinal
discovery
which
marks
an
epoch
in
the
life
of
every
man
who
arrives
at
it
that
persons
are
very
like
other
persons
and
he
was
happy
and
rather
proud
in
this
discovery
and
began
to
feel
a
certain
vague
desire
to
tell
mr
seven
sachs
the
history
of
his
career
or
at
any
rate
the
picturesque
portions
of
it
for
he
too
was
famous
in
his
own
sphere
and
in
the
of
wilkins
one
celebrity
was
with
another
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
mr
brindley
yes
he
was
happy
both
in
what
he
had
already
accomplished
and
in
the
contemplation
of
romantic
adventures
to
come
and
yet
his
happiness
was
marred
not
fatally
but
quite
appreciably
by
a
remorse
that
no
amount
of
private
argument
with
himself
would
conjure
away
which
was
the
more
singular
in
that
a
morbid
tendency
to
remorse
had
never
been
among
edward
defects
he
was
worrying
foolish
fellow
about
the
false
in
which
for
the
purpose
of
testing
rose
loyalty
to
the
new
enterprise
he
had
pretended
to
be
the
new
private
secretary
of
sir
john
pilgrim
yet
what
harm
had
it
done
and
had
it
not
done
a
lot
of
good
rose
euclid
and
her
youthful
worshipper
were
no
worse
off
than
they
had
been
before
being
victimized
by
the
deceit
of
the
prior
to
the
call
they
had
assumed
themselves
to
be
deprived
for
ever
of
the
benefits
which
association
with
sir
john
pilgrim
could
offer
and
as
a
fact
they
were
deprived
for
ever
of
such
benefits
nothing
changed
there
before
the
call
they
had
had
no
hope
of
lunching
with
the
enormous
sir
john
on
the
morrow
and
as
a
fact
they
would
not
lunch
with
the
enormous
sir
john
on
the
morrow
nothing
changed
there
either
again
in
no
event
would
edward
henry
have
joined
the
trio
in
order
to
make
a
quartet
in
partnership
even
had
he
been
as
convinced
of
rose
loyalty
as
he
was
convinced
of
her
disloyalty
he
would
never
have
been
rash
enough
to
with
such
a
crew
again
nothing
changed
on
the
other
hand
he
had
acquired
an
assurance
of
the
duplicity
which
assurance
had
made
it
easier
for
him
to
disappoint
her
while
the
prospect
of
a
business
repast
with
sir
john
had
helped
her
to
bear
the
disappointment
as
a
brave
woman
should
it
was
true
that
on
the
morrow
about
rose
euclid
and
carlo
trent
might
have
to
live
through
a
few
rather
trying
moments
and
they
would
certainly
be
very
angry
but
these
drawbacks
would
have
been
more
than
compensated
for
in
advance
by
the
pleasures
of
hope
and
had
they
not
between
them
pocketed
pounds
which
they
had
stood
to
lose
such
reasoning
was
unanswerable
and
his
remorse
did
not
attempt
to
answer
it
his
remorse
was
not
open
to
reason
it
was
one
of
those
stupid
primitive
sentiments
which
obstinately
persist
in
the
refined
and
rational
fabric
of
modern
humanity
he
was
just
sorry
for
rose
euclid
do
you
know
what
i
did
he
burst
out
confidentially
and
confessed
the
whole
to
mr
seven
sachs
mr
seven
sachs
somewhat
to
edward
henry
surprise
expressed
high
admiration
of
the
device
a
bit
mean
though
do
you
think
edward
henry
protested
weakly
not
at
all
cried
sachs
you
got
the
goods
on
her
and
she
deserved
it
again
this
enigmatic
and
mystical
word
goods
but
he
understood
it
thus
encouraged
he
was
now
quite
determined
to
give
mr
seven
sachs
a
brief
episodic
account
of
his
career
a
fair
conversational
opening
was
all
he
wanted
in
order
to
begin
i
wonder
what
will
happen
to
her
ultimately
he
said
meaning
to
work
back
from
the
ends
of
careers
to
their
beginnings
and
so
to
himself
rose
euclid
yes
sachs
shook
his
head
compassionately
how
did
bryany
get
in
with
her
asked
edward
henry
bryany
is
a
highly
peculiar
person
said
mr
seven
sachs
familiarly
he
all
right
so
long
as
you
do
unstrap
him
he
was
born
to
convince
newspaper
reporters
of
his
own
greatness
i
had
a
bit
of
a
talk
with
him
myself
said
edward
henry
oh
yes
he
told
me
all
about
you
but
never
told
him
anything
about
myself
said
edward
henry
quickly
no
but
he
has
eyes
you
know
and
ears
too
seems
to
me
the
people
of
the
five
towns
do
little
else
of
a
night
but
discuss
you
machin
heard
a
good
bit
when
was
down
there
though
i
go
about
much
when
i
on
the
road
i
reckon
i
could
write
a
whole
biography
of
you
edward
henry
smiled
he
was
of
course
enraptured
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
disappointing
to
find
sachs
already
so
fully
informed
as
to
the
details
of
his
career
however
he
did
not
intend
to
let
that
prevent
him
from
telling
the
story
afresh
in
his
own
manner
i
suppose
you
had
your
adventures
too
he
remarked
with
nonchalance
partly
from
politeness
but
mainly
in
order
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
hurry
in
his
egotism
iv
you
bet
i
have
mr
seven
sachs
cordially
agreed
abandoning
the
end
of
a
cigarette
putting
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
crossing
his
legs
whereupon
there
was
a
brief
pause
i
remember
edward
henry
began
i
daresay
you
heard
began
mr
seven
sachs
simultaneously
they
were
like
two
men
who
by
inadvertence
had
attempted
to
pass
through
a
narrow
doorway
abreast
edward
henry
as
the
host
drew
back
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologized
not
at
all
said
seven
sachs
i
was
only
going
to
say
probably
heard
that
i
was
always
up
against
archibald
florance
really
murmured
edward
henry
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
for
the
renown
of
archibald
florance
exceeded
that
of
seven
sachs
as
the
sun
the
moon
and
was
older
and
more
securely
established
than
it
as
the
sun
the
moon
the
renown
of
rose
euclid
was
as
naught
to
it
doubtful
it
was
whether
in
the
annals
of
modern
histrionics
the
grandeur
and
the
romance
of
that
american
name
could
be
surpassed
by
any
renown
save
that
of
the
incomparable
henry
irving
the
retirement
of
archibald
florance
from
the
stage
a
couple
of
years
earlier
had
caused
crimson
gleams
of
sunset
splendour
to
shoot
across
the
atlantic
and
irradiate
even
the
garrick
club
london
so
that
the
members
thereof
had
to
shade
their
offended
eyes
edward
henry
had
never
seen
archibald
florance
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
seen
him
in
order
to
appreciate
the
majesty
of
his
glory
no
male
in
the
history
of
the
world
was
ever
more
photographed
and
few
have
been
the
subject
of
more
anecdotes
i
expect
he
a
wealthy
chap
in
his
old
age
said
edward
henry
wealthy
exclaimed
sachs
he
the
richest
actor
in
america
and
that
saying
in
the
world
he
had
the
greatest
reputation
still
the
handsomest
man
in
the
united
states
that
admitted
with
his
white
hair
they
used
to
say
he
was
the
cruellest
but
it
not
so
though
of
course
he
could
be
a
perfect
terror
with
his
companies
and
so
you
knew
archibald
florance
you
bet
i
did
he
never
had
any
friends
never
but
i
knew
him
as
well
as
anybody
could
why
in
san
francisco
after
the
show
walked
with
him
back
to
his
hotel
and
he
walked
with
me
back
to
mine
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
three
or
four
in
the
morning
you
see
we
could
stop
until
it
happened
that
he
finished
a
cigar
at
the
exact
moment
when
we
got
to
his
hotel
door
if
the
cigar
finished
then
he
must
needs
stroll
back
a
bit
and
before
i
knew
where
i
was
he
be
lighting
a
fresh
one
he
smoked
the
finest
cigars
in
america
i
remember
him
telling
me
they
cost
him
three
dollars
apiece
and
edward
henry
then
perceived
another
profound
truth
his
second
cardinal
discovery
on
that
notable
evening
namely
that
no
matter
how
high
you
rise
you
will
always
find
that
others
have
risen
higher
nay
it
is
not
until
you
have
achieved
a
considerable
peak
that
you
are
able
to
appreciate
the
loftiness
of
those
mightier
summits
he
himself
was
high
and
so
he
could
judge
the
greater
height
of
seven
sachs
and
it
was
only
through
the
greater
height
of
seven
sachs
that
he
could
form
an
adequate
idea
of
the
pinnacle
occupied
by
the
unique
archibald
florance
honestly
he
had
never
dreamt
that
there
existed
a
man
who
habitually
smoked
cigars
and
yet
he
reckoned
to
know
a
thing
or
two
about
cigars
i
am
nothing
he
thought
modestly
nevertheless
though
the
savour
of
the
name
of
archibald
florance
was
agreeable
he
decided
that
he
had
heard
enough
for
the
moment
about
archibald
florance
and
that
he
would
relate
to
sachs
the
famous
episode
of
his
own
career
in
which
the
countess
of
chell
and
a
mule
had
so
prominently
performed
i
remember
he
recommenced
my
first
encounter
with
archibald
florance
was
very
funny
proceeded
mr
seven
sachs
blandly
deaf
i
was
starving
in
new
york
trying
to
sell
a
new
razor
on
commission
and
i
was
determined
to
get
on
to
the
stage
i
had
one
left
just
one
i
wrote
on
it
and
sent
it
up
to
wunch
i
do
know
whether
you
ever
heard
of
wunch
wunch
was
archibald
florance
and
nearly
as
famous
as
archibald
himself
well
wunch
sent
for
me
upstairs
to
his
room
but
when
he
found
i
was
only
the
usual
youngster
after
the
usual
job
he
just
had
me
thrown
out
of
the
theatre
he
said
i
no
right
to
put
on
a
i
said
to
myself
going
to
get
back
into
that
theatre
somehow
so
i
went
up
to
archibald
private
house
sixtieth
street
i
think
it
was
and
asked
to
see
him
and
i
saw
him
when
i
got
into
his
room
he
was
writing
he
kept
on
writing
for
some
minutes
and
then
he
swung
round
on
his
chair
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
he
said
you
want
any
actors
mr
florance
i
said
you
an
actor
he
said
want
to
be
one
i
said
he
said
a
school
round
the
corner
i
said
might
give
me
a
card
of
introduction
mr
florance
he
gave
me
the
card
i
did
take
it
to
the
school
i
went
straight
back
to
the
theatre
with
it
and
had
it
sent
up
to
wunch
it
just
said
sachs
a
young
man
anxious
to
get
on
wunch
took
it
for
a
positive
order
to
find
me
a
place
the
company
was
full
so
he
threw
out
one
poor
devil
of
a
super
to
make
room
for
me
curious
thing
old
wunchy
got
it
into
his
head
that
i
was
a
of
archibald
and
he
always
looked
after
me
what
d
think
about
that
brilliant
said
edward
henry
and
it
was
the
simplicity
of
the
thing
was
what
impressed
him
since
winning
a
scholarship
at
school
by
altering
the
number
of
marks
opposite
his
name
on
a
paper
lying
on
the
master
desk
edward
henry
had
never
achieved
advancement
by
a
device
so
simple
and
he
thought
i
am
nothing
the
five
towns
is
nothing
all
that
one
hears
about
americans
and
the
united
states
is
true
as
far
as
getting
on
goes
they
can
make
rings
round
us
still
i
shall
tell
him
about
the
countess
and
the
mule
yes
continued
mr
seven
sachs
wunch
was
very
kind
to
me
but
he
was
pretty
well
down
and
out
and
he
left
and
archibald
got
a
new
and
i
was
promoted
to
do
a
bit
of
assistant
but
i
got
no
increase
of
salary
there
were
two
women
stars
in
the
play
archibald
was
doing
then
romantic
drama
you
know
melodrama
you
call
it
over
here
he
never
did
any
other
sort
of
play
well
these
two
women
stars
were
about
equal
and
when
the
curtain
fell
on
the
first
act
they
both
make
a
bee
line
for
archibald
to
see
who
get
to
him
first
and
engage
him
in
talk
they
were
jealous
enough
of
each
other
to
kill
anybody
could
see
that
archibald
was
frightfully
bored
but
he
could
escape
they
got
him
on
both
sides
you
see
and
he
just
to
talk
to
both
at
once
i
used
to
be
fussing
around
fixing
the
properties
for
the
next
act
well
one
night
he
comes
up
to
me
archibald
does
and
he
says
what
your
name
sir
i
says
notice
when
those
two
ladies
come
up
to
me
after
the
first
act
well
when
you
see
them
talking
to
me
i
want
you
to
come
right
along
and
interrupt
he
says
shall
i
say
sir
me
on
the
shoulder
and
say
i
wanted
about
something
very
urgent
you
see
so
the
next
night
when
those
women
got
hold
of
him
sure
enough
i
went
up
between
them
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
florance
i
said
very
urgent
he
turned
on
me
and
scowled
is
it
he
said
and
he
looked
very
angry
it
was
a
bit
of
the
best
acting
the
old
man
ever
did
in
his
life
it
was
so
good
that
at
first
i
thought
it
was
real
he
said
again
louder
is
it
so
i
said
florance
the
most
urgent
thing
in
this
theatre
is
that
i
should
have
an
increase
of
salary
i
guess
i
licked
the
stuffing
out
of
him
that
time
edward
henry
gave
vent
to
one
of
those
cordial
and
violent
guffaws
which
are
a
specialty
of
the
humorous
side
of
the
five
towns
and
he
said
to
himself
i
should
never
have
thought
of
anything
as
good
as
that
and
did
you
get
it
he
asked
the
old
man
said
not
a
word
mr
seven
sachs
went
on
in
the
same
even
tranquil
smiling
voice
but
next
i
found
i
got
a
rise
of
ten
dollars
a
week
and
not
only
that
but
florance
offered
me
a
singing
part
in
his
new
drama
if
i
could
play
the
mandolin
i
naturally
told
him
i
played
the
mandolin
all
my
life
i
went
out
and
bought
a
mandolin
and
hired
a
teacher
he
wanted
to
teach
me
the
mandolin
but
i
only
wanted
him
to
teach
me
that
one
accompaniment
so
i
fired
him
and
practised
by
myself
night
and
day
for
a
week
i
got
through
all
the
rehearsals
without
ever
singing
that
song
cleverest
dodging
i
ever
did
on
the
first
night
i
was
so
nervous
i
could
scarcely
hold
the
mandolin
i
never
played
the
infernal
thing
before
anybody
at
all
only
up
in
my
bedroom
i
struck
the
first
chord
and
found
the
darned
instrument
was
all
out
of
tune
with
the
orchestra
so
i
just
pretended
to
play
it
and
squawked
away
with
my
song
and
never
let
my
fingers
touch
the
strings
at
all
old
florance
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
wings
i
knew
he
was
going
to
fire
me
but
no
he
said
accompaniment
was
the
most
delicate
piece
of
playing
i
ever
heard
i
congratulate
you
he
was
quite
serious
everybody
said
the
same
luck
eh
i
should
say
so
said
edward
henry
gradually
beginning
to
be
interested
in
the
odyssey
of
mr
seven
sachs
i
remember
a
funny
thing
that
happened
to
me
however
sachs
swept
smoothly
along
that
piece
was
a
failure
and
archibald
arranged
to
take
a
company
to
europe
with
and
i
was
left
out
this
rattled
me
specially
after
the
way
he
liked
my
so
i
went
to
see
him
about
it
in
his
one
night
and
i
charged
around
a
bit
he
did
rattle
me
then
i
rattled
him
i
would
get
an
answer
out
of
him
he
said
not
in
the
habit
of
being
in
my
own
i
did
care
what
happened
then
so
i
said
i
not
in
the
habit
of
being
treated
as
you
treating
me
all
of
a
sudden
he
became
quite
quiet
and
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
getting
on
very
well
sachs
he
said
only
been
at
it
one
year
it
taken
me
years
to
get
where
i
am
however
i
was
too
angry
to
stand
for
that
sort
of
talk
i
said
to
him
daresay
you
a
very
great
and
enviable
man
florance
but
i
propose
to
save
fifteen
years
on
your
i
equal
or
better
your
position
in
ten
years
he
shoved
me
out
just
shoved
me
out
of
the
room
it
was
that
that
made
me
turn
to
florance
wrote
his
own
plays
sometimes
but
it
was
only
his
acting
and
his
face
that
saved
them
and
they
were
too
american
he
never
did
really
well
outside
america
except
in
one
play
and
that
was
his
own
now
i
was
out
after
money
and
i
still
am
i
wanted
to
please
the
largest
possible
public
so
i
guessed
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
the
universal
appeal
i
never
write
a
play
that
wo
appeal
to
england
germany
france
just
as
well
as
to
america
america
big
but
it
is
big
enough
for
me
well
as
i
was
saying
soon
after
that
i
got
a
play
produced
at
hannibal
missouri
and
the
same
week
there
was
a
company
at
another
theatre
there
playing
the
old
man
and
the
next
morning
the
theatrical
critic
article
in
the
hannibal
was
headed
attractions
archibald
florance
and
new
play
by
seven
sachs
i
cut
that
heading
out
and
sent
it
to
the
old
man
in
london
and
i
wrote
under
it
how
far
i
got
in
six
months
when
he
came
back
he
took
me
into
his
company
again
what
price
that
eh
edward
henry
could
only
nod
his
head
the
customarily
silent
seven
sachs
had
little
by
little
subdued
him
to
an
admiration
as
mute
as
it
was
profound
nearly
five
years
after
that
i
got
a
christmas
card
from
old
florance
it
had
the
usual
printed
wishes
possible
christmas
and
so
on
but
underneath
that
archibald
had
written
in
pencil
still
five
years
to
go
that
made
me
roll
my
sleeves
up
as
you
may
say
well
a
long
time
after
that
i
was
standing
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
street
and
looking
at
my
own
name
in
electric
letters
on
the
criterion
theatre
first
time
i
ever
seen
it
in
electric
letters
on
broadway
it
was
the
first
night
of
florance
was
playing
at
the
hudson
theatre
which
is
a
bit
higher
up
street
and
name
was
in
electric
letters
too
but
further
off
broadway
than
mine
i
strolled
up
just
out
of
idle
curiosity
and
there
the
old
man
was
standing
in
the
porch
of
the
theatre
all
alone
sachs
he
said
glad
seen
you
it
saved
me
cents
i
asked
how
he
said
was
just
going
to
send
you
a
telegram
of
congratulations
he
liked
me
old
archibald
did
he
still
does
but
i
had
done
with
him
i
went
to
stay
with
him
at
his
house
on
long
island
in
the
spring
me
florance
i
says
to
him
many
companies
have
you
got
on
the
road
he
said
i
have
got
many
now
five
i
think
i
says
got
six
here
in
the
united
states
two
in
england
three
in
austria
and
one
in
italy
he
said
a
cigar
sachs
you
got
the
goods
on
me
he
was
living
in
that
magnificent
house
all
alone
with
a
whole
regiment
of
servants
v
well
said
edward
henry
you
a
great
man
no
i
not
said
mr
seven
sachs
but
my
income
is
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
rising
i
out
after
the
stuff
all
i
say
you
are
a
great
man
edward
henry
repeated
recital
had
inspired
him
he
kept
saying
to
himself
and
i
a
great
man
too
and
i
show
sachs
having
delivered
himself
of
his
load
had
now
lapsed
comfortably
back
into
his
original
silence
and
was
prepared
to
listen
but
edward
henry
somehow
had
lost
the
desire
to
enlarge
on
his
own
variegated
past
he
was
absorbed
in
the
greater
future
at
length
he
said
very
distinctly
you
honestly
think
i
could
run
a
theatre
you
were
born
to
run
a
theatre
said
seven
sachs
thrilled
edward
henry
responded
then
i
write
to
those
lawyer
people
slossons
and
tell
be
around
with
the
brass
about

a

had
delicately
chimed
two
if
ever
you
come
to
new
york
and
i
can
do
anything
for
you
said
sachs
heartily
thanks
said
edward
henry
they
were
shaking
hands
i
say
edward
henry
went
on
there
one
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
why
you
promise
to
back
rose
euclid
and
her
friends
you
must
surely
have
known
he
threw
up
his
hands
sachs
answered
i
be
frank
with
you
it
was
her
cousin
that
persuaded
me
into
it
elsie
april
elsie
april
who
she
oh
you
must
have
seen
them
about
together
her
and
rose
euclid
they
nearly
always
together
i
saw
her
in
the
restaurant
here
with
a
rather
jolly
girl
blue
hat
that
the
one
as
soon
as
you
made
her
acquaintance
understand
what
i
mean
said
mr
seven
sachs
ah
but
i
not
a
bachelor
like
you
edward
henry
smiled
archly
well
you
see
when
you
meet
her
said
sachs
upon
which
enigmatic
warning
he
departed
and
was
lost
in
the
immense
glittering
nocturnal
silence
of
wilkins
edward
henry
sat
down
to
write
to
slossons
by
the
post
but
as
he
wrote
he
kept
saying
to
himself
so
elsie
april
her
name
is
it
and
she
actually
persuaded
sachs
sachs
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
chapter
vi
lord
woldo
and
lady
woldo
i
the
next
morning
joseph
having
opened
wide
the
window
informed
his
master
that
the
weather
was
bright
and
sunny
and
edward
henry
arose
with
just
that
pleasant
degree
of
fatigue
which
persuades
one
that
one
is
if
anything
rather
more
highly
vitalized
than
usual
he
sent
for
bryany
as
for
a
domestic
animal
and
bryany
ceremoniously
attired
was
received
by
a
sort
of
jolly
king
who
happened
to
be
trimming
his
beard
in
the
royal
bathroom
but
who
was
too
to
keep
bryany
waiting
it
is
remarkable
how
the
habit
of
royalty
having
once
taken
root
will
flourish
in
the
minds
of
quite
unmonarchical
persons
edward
henry
first
inquired
after
the
health
of
mr
seven
sachs
and
then
obtained
from
bryany
all
remaining
papers
and
trifles
of
information
concerning
the
affair
of
the
option
whereupon
bryany
apparently
much
elated
by
the
honour
of
an
informal
reception
effusively
retired
and
edward
henry
too
was
so
elated
and
his
faith
in
life
so
renewed
and
invigorated
that
he
said
to
himself
it
might
be
worth
while
to
shave
my
beard
off
after
all
as
in
his
electric
brougham
he
drove
along
muddy
and
shining
piccadilly
he
admitted
that
joseph
account
of
the
weather
had
been
very
accurate
the
weather
was
magnificent
it
presented
the
best
features
of
summer
combined
with
the
salutary
pungency
of
autumn
and
flags
were
flying
over
the
establishments
of
tobacconists
soothsayers
and
insurance
companies
in
piccadilly
and
the
sense
of
empire
was
in
the
very
air
like
an
intoxication
and
there
was
no
place
like
london
when
however
having
run
through
piccadilly
into
streets
less
superb
he
reached
the
majestic
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
majestic
was
not
a
part
of
london
but
a
bit
of
the
provinces
surrounded
by
london
he
was
very
disappointed
with
the
majestic
and
took
his
letters
from
the
clerk
with
careless
condescension
in
a
few
days
the
majestic
had
sunk
from
being
one
of
london
huge
caravanserais
to
the
level
of
a
swollen
turk
head
so
fragile
are
reputations
from
the
majestic
edward
henry
drove
back
into
the
regions
of
empire
between
piccadilly
and
regent
street
and
deigned
to
call
upon
his
tailors
a
which
he
had
commanded
being
miraculously
finished
he
put
it
on
and
was
at
once
not
only
spectacularly
but
morally
regenerated
the
old
suit
though
it
had
cost
five
guineas
in
its
time
looked
a
paltry
and
a
dowdy
thing
as
it
lay
flung
down
anyhow
on
one
of
messrs
quayther
cuthering
cane
chairs
in
the
mirrored
cubicle
where
baronets
and
even
peers
showed
their
braces
to
the
benign
cuthering
i
want
to
go
to
piccadilly
circus
now
stop
at
the
fountain
said
edward
henry
to
his
chauffeur
he
gave
the
order
somewhat
defiantly
because
he
was
a
little
in
the
new
and
gleaming
suit
and
because
he
had
an
absurd
idea
that
the
chauffeur
might
guess
that
he
a
provincial
from
the
five
towns
was
about
to
venture
into
west
end
theatrical
enterprise
and
sneer
at
him
accordingly
but
the
chauffeur
merely
touched
his
cap
with
an
indifferent
and
lofty
gesture
as
if
to
say
be
at
ease
i
have
driven
persons
more
even
than
you
human
eccentricity
has
long
since
ceased
to
surprise
me
the
fountain
in
piccadilly
circus
was
the
gayest
thing
in
london
it
mingled
the
fresh
tinkling
of
water
with
the
odour
and
flame
of
autumn
blossoms
and
the
variegated
colours
of
shawled
women
who
passed
their
lives
on
its
margin
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
flowers
edward
henry
bought
an
aster
from
a
fine
bold
blowsy
dirty
wench
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
left
some
change
for
the
baby
he
was
in
a
very
tolerant
and
charitable
mood
and
could
excuse
the
sins
and
the
stupidity
of
all
mankind
he
reflected
forgivingly
that
rose
euclid
and
her
friends
had
perhaps
not
displayed
an
abnormal
fatuity
in
discussing
the
name
of
the
theatre
before
they
had
got
the
lease
of
the
site
for
it
had
not
he
himself
bought
all
the
option
without
having
even
seen
the
site
the
fact
was
that
he
had
had
no
leisure
in
his
short
royal
career
for
such
details
as
seeing
the
site
he
was
now
about
to
make
good
the
omission
it
is
a
fact
that
as
he
turned
northwards
from
piccadilly
circus
to
the
right
of
the
county
fire
office
in
order
to
spy
out
the
land
upon
which
his
theatre
was
to
be
built
he
hesitated
under
the
delusion
that
all
the
were
staring
at
him
he
felt
just
as
he
might
have
felt
had
he
been
engaged
upon
some
scheme
nefarious
he
even
went
back
and
pretended
to
examine
the
windows
of
the
county
fire
office
then
glancing
about
he
discerned
not
unnaturally
the
words
regent
street
on
a
sign
there
you
are
he
murmured
with
a
thrill
there
you
are
obviously
only
one
name
for
that
theatre
regent
it
close
to
regent
street
no
other
theatre
is
called
regent
nobody
before
ever
had
the
idea
of
as
a
name
for
a
theatre
indeed
regent
theatre
how
well
it
comes
off
the
tongue
it
a
great
name
it
be
the
finest
name
of
any
theatre
in
london
and
it
took
yours
truly
to
think
of
it
then
he
smiled
privately
at
his
own
weakness
he
too
like
the
despised
rose
was
baptizing
the
unborn
still
he
continued
to
dream
of
the
theatre
and
began
to
picture
to
himself
the
ideal
theatre
he
discovered
that
he
had
quite
a
number
of
startling
ideas
about
based
on
his
own
experience
as
a
playgoer
when
with
new
courage
he
directed
his
feet
towards
the
site
upon
which
he
knew
there
was
an
old
chapel
known
as
queen
glasshouse
chapel
whose
ownership
had
slipped
from
the
nerveless
hand
of
a
dying
sect
of
dissenters
he
could
not
find
the
site
and
he
could
not
see
the
chapel
for
an
instant
he
was
perturbed
by
a
horrid
suspicion
that
he
had
been
victimized
by
a
gang
of
swindlers
posing
as
celebrated
persons
everything
was
possible
in
this
world
and
century
none
of
the
people
who
had
appeared
in
the
transaction
had
resembled
his
previous
conceptions
of
such
people
and
always
operated
in
the
grandest
hotels
he
immediately
decided
that
if
the
sequel
should
prove
him
to
be
a
simpleton
and
gull
he
would
at
any
rate
be
a
silent
simpleton
and
gull
he
would
stoically
bear
the
loss
of
two
hundred
pounds
and
breathe
no
word
of
woe
but
then
he
remembered
with
relief
that
he
had
genuinely
recognized
both
rose
euclid
and
seven
sachs
and
also
that
bryany
among
other
documents
had
furnished
him
with
a
photograph
of
the
chapel
and
surrounding
property
the
chapel
therefore
existed
he
had
a
plan
in
his
pocket
he
now
opened
this
plan
and
tried
to
consult
it
in
the
middle
of
the
street
but
his
agitation
was
such
that
he
could
not
make
out
on
it
which
was
north
and
which
was
south
after
he
had
been
nearly
prostrated
by
a
a
policeman
came
up
to
him
and
said
with
all
the
friendly
disdain
of
a
london
policeman
addressing
a
provincial
safer
to
look
at
that
on
the
pavement
sir
edward
henry
glanced
up
from
the
plan
i
was
trying
to
find
the
queen
glasshouse
chapel
officer
said
he
have
you
ever
heard
of
it
in
bursley
members
of
the
town
council
always
flattered
members
of
the
force
by
addressing
them
as
officer
and
edward
henry
knew
exactly
the
effective
intonation
it
sir
said
the
policeman
less
disdainful
pointing
to
a
narrow
hoarding
behind
which
could
be
seen
the
of
high
buildings
in
shaftesbury
avenue
they
just
finished
pulling
it
down
thank
you
said
edward
henry
quietly
with
a
superb
and
successful
effort
to
keep
as
much
colour
in
his
face
as
if
the
policeman
had
not
dealt
him
a
dizzying
blow
he
then
walked
towards
the
hoarding
but
could
scarcely
feel
the
ground
under
his
feet
from
a
wide
aperture
in
the
palisades
a
cart
full
of
earth
was
emerging
it
creaked
and
shook
as
it
was
dragged
by
a
labouring
horse
over
loose
planks
into
the
roadway
a
carter
hovered
on
its
flank
edward
henry
approached
the
aperture
and
gazed
within
an
elegant
young
man
stood
solitary
inside
the
hoarding
and
stared
at
a
razed
expanse
of
land
in
whose
furthest
corner
some
navvies
were
digging
a
hole
the
site
but
what
did
this
sinister
destructive
activity
mean
nobody
was
entitled
to
interfere
with
property
on
which
he
alderman
machin
held
an
unexpired
option
but
was
it
the
site
he
perused
the
plan
again
with
more
care
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
site
his
eye
roved
round
and
he
admitted
the
justice
of
the
boast
that
an
electric
sign
displayed
at
the
southern
front
corner
of
the
theatre
would
be
visible
from
piccadilly
circus
lower
regent
street
shaftesbury
avenue
etc
he
then
observed
a
large
raised
on
posts
above
the
hoardings
and
read
the
following
site
of
the
first
new
thought
church
to
be
opened
next
spring
subscriptions
invited
rollo
wrissell
ralph
alloyd
dicks
pato
the
name
of
rollo
wrissell
seemed
familiar
to
him
and
after
a
few
moments
searching
he
recalled
that
rollo
wrissell
was
one
of
the
trustees
and
executors
of
the
late
lord
woldo
the
other
being
the
widow
and
the
mother
of
the
new
lord
woldo
in
addition
to
the
lettering
the
held
a
graphic
representation
of
the
first
new
thought
church
as
it
would
be
when
completed
well
said
edward
henry
not
perhaps
unjustifiably
this
really
is
a
bit
thick
here
i
got
an
option
on
a
plot
of
land
for
building
a
theatre
and
somebody
else
has
taken
it
to
put
up
a
church
he
ventured
inside
the
hoarding
and
addressing
the
elegant
young
man
asked
you
got
anything
to
do
with
this
mister
well
said
the
young
man
smiling
humorously
i
the
architect
it
true
that
nobody
ever
pays
any
attention
to
an
architect
in
these
days
oh
you
mr
alloyd
i
am
alloyd
had
black
hair
intensely
black
changeful
eyes
and
the
expressive
mouth
of
an
actor
i
thought
they
were
going
to
build
a
theatre
here
said
edward
henry
i
wish
they
had
been
said
alloyd
i
just
like
to
design
a
theatre
but
of
course
i
shall
never
get
the
chance
why
not
i
know
i
sha
alloyd
insisted
with
gloomy
disgust
only
obtained
this
job
by
sheer
accident
you
got
any
ideas
about
theatres
well
i
have
said
edward
henry
alloyd
turned
on
him
with
a
sardonic
and
gleam
and
what
are
your
ideas
about
theatres
well
said
edward
henry
i
should
like
to
meet
an
architect
who
had
thoroughly
got
it
into
his
head
that
when
people
pay
for
seats
to
see
a
play
they
want
to
be
able
to
it
and
not
just
get
a
look
at
it
now
and
then
over
other
people
heads
and
round
corners
of
boxes
and
things
in
most
theatres
that
i
been
in
the
architects
seemed
to
think
that
iron
pillars
and
wooden
heads
are
transparent
either
that
or
the
architects
were
rascals
same
with
hearing
the
pit
costs
and
you
do
pay
to
hear
glasses
rattled
in
a
bar
or
rushing
down
the
street
i
was
never
yet
in
a
london
theatre
where
the
architect
had
really
understood
that
what
the
people
in
the
pit
wanted
to
hear
was
the
play
and
nothing
but
the
play
you
rather
hard
on
us
said
alloyd
not
so
hard
as
you
are
on
said
edward
henry
and
then
draughts
i
suppose
you
think
a
draught
on
the
back
of
the
neck
is
good
for
us
but
of
course
you
say
all
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
architecture
oh
no
i
sha
oh
no
i
sha
exclaimed
alloyd
i
quite
agree
with
you
you
certainly
you
seem
to
be
interested
in
theatres
i
am
a
bit
you
come
from
the
north
no
i
do
said
edward
henry
alloyd
had
no
right
to
be
aware
that
he
was
not
a
londoner
i
beg
your
pardon
i
come
from
the
midlands
oh
have
you
seen
the
russian
ballet
edward
henry
had
not
nor
heard
of
it
why
he
asked
nothing
said
alloyd
only
i
saw
it
the
night
before
last
in
paris
you
never
saw
such
dancing
it
enchanted
enchanted
the
most
lovely
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
i
could
sleep
for
it
not
that
i
ever
sleep
very
well
i
merely
thought
as
you
were
interested
in
theatres
and
midland
people
are
so
enterprising
have
a
cigarette
edward
henry
who
had
begun
to
feel
sympathetic
was
somewhat
repelled
by
these
odd
last
remarks
after
all
the
man
though
human
enough
was
an
utter
stranger
no
thanks
he
said
and
so
you
going
to
put
up
a
church
here
yes
well
i
wonder
whether
you
are
he
walked
abruptly
away
under
alloyd
riddling
stare
and
he
could
almost
hear
the
man
saying
well
he
a
queer
lot
if
you
like
at
the
corner
of
the
site
below
the
spot
where
his
electric
sign
was
to
have
been
he
was
stopped
by
a
lady
who
bore
a
bundle
of
papers
will
you
buy
a
paper
for
the
cause
she
suggested
in
a
pleasant
persuasive
tone
one
penny
he
obeyed
and
she
handed
him
a
small
periodical
of
which
the
title
was
the
organ
of
the
new
thought
church
he
glanced
at
it
puzzled
and
then
at
the
lady
every
penny
of
profit
goes
to
the
church
building
fund
she
said
as
if
in
defence
of
her
action
edward
henry
burst
out
laughing
but
it
was
a
nervous
laugh
that
he
laughed
ii
in
carey
street
lincoln
inn
fields
he
descended
from
his
brougham
in
front
of
the
offices
of
messrs
slosson
hodge
budge
slosson
maveringham
slosson
vulto
solicitors
known
in
the
profession
by
the
compendious
abbreviation
of
slossons
edward
henry
having
been
a
lawyer
clerk
some
years
earlier
was
aware
of
slossons
although
on
the
strength
of
his
youthful
clerkship
he
claimed
and
was
admitted
to
possess
a
very
special
knowledge
of
the
law
enough
to
silence
argument
when
his
opponent
did
not
happen
to
be
an
actual
solicitor
he
did
not
in
truth
possess
a
very
special
knowledge
of
the
law
how
should
he
seeing
that
he
had
only
been
a
practitioner
of
shorthand
but
the
fame
of
slossons
he
positively
was
acquainted
with
he
had
even
written
letters
to
the
mighty
slossons
every
lawyer
and
lawyer
clerk
in
the
realm
knew
the
greatness
of
slossons
and
crouched
before
it
and
also
for
the
most
part
impugned
its
righteousness
with
sneers
for
slossons
acted
for
the
ruling
classes
of
england
who
only
get
value
for
their
money
when
they
are
buying
something
that
they
can
see
smell
handle
or
intimidate
such
as
a
horse
a
a
dog
or
a
lackey
slossons
those
crack
solicitors
like
the
crack
nerve
specialists
in
harley
street
and
the
crack
in
bond
street
sold
their
invisible
inodorous
and
intangible
wares
of
advice
at
double
treble
or
decuple
their
worth
according
to
the
psychology
of
the
customer
they
were
great
bullies
and
they
were
further
great
on
behalf
of
their
wealthier
clients
in
obedience
to
a
convenient
theory
that
it
is
imprudent
to
leave
money
too
long
in
one
place
they
were
continually
calling
in
mortgages
and
the
sums
so
collected
on
fresh
investments
thus
achieving
two
bills
of
costs
on
each
transaction
and
sometimes
three
besides
employing
an
army
of
valuers
surveyors
and
brokers
in
short
slossons
had
nothing
to
learn
about
the
art
of
three
vast
waited
in
front
of
their
ancient
door
and
edward
henry
hired
electric
vehicle
was
diminished
to
a
trifle
he
began
by
demanding
the
senior
partner
who
was
denied
to
him
by
an
old
clerk
with
a
face
like
a
stone
wall
only
his
brutal
midland
insistence
and
the
mention
of
the
important
letter
which
he
had
written
to
the
firm
in
the
middle
of
the
night
saved
him
from
the
ignominy
of
seeing
no
partner
at
all
at
the
end
of
the
descending
ladder
of
partners
he
clung
desperately
to
vulto
and
he
saw
vulto
a
youngish
and
sarcastic
person
with
blue
eyes
lodged
in
a
dark
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
it
occurred
fortunately
that
his
letter
had
been
allotted
to
precisely
vulto
for
the
purpose
of
being
answered
you
got
my
letter
said
edward
henry
cheerfully
as
he
sat
down
at
vulto
flat
desk
on
the
side
opposite
from
vulto
we
got
it
but
frankly
we
can
not
make
head
or
tail
of
it
option
vulto
manner
was
crudely
sarcastic
option
said
edward
henry
drawing
papers
from
his
pocket
and
putting
down
the
right
paper
in
front
of
vulto
with
an
uncompromising
slap
vulto
picked
up
the
paper
with
precautions
as
if
it
were
a
contagion
and
assuming
eyeglasses
perused
it
with
his
mouth
open
we
know
nothing
of
this
said
vulto
and
it
was
as
though
he
had
added
therefore
this
does
not
exist
he
glanced
with
sufferance
at
the
window
which
offered
a
view
of
a
whitewashed
wall
then
you
were
in
the
confidence
of
your
client
the
late
lord
woldo
yes
pardon
me
obviously
you
were
in
his
confidence
as
regards
this
particular
matter
as
you
say
said
vulto
with
frigid
irony
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
well
nothing
vulto
removed
his
eyeglasses
and
stood
up
well
good
morning
i
walk
round
to
solicitors
edward
henry
seized
the
option
that
will
be
simpler
said
vulto
slossons
much
preferred
to
deal
with
lawyers
than
with
laymen
because
it
increased
costs
and
vitalized
the
profession
at
that
moment
a
stout
and
hoary
man
puffed
very
authoritatively
into
the
room
vulto
he
cried
sharply
wrissell
here
did
they
tell
you
yes
slosson
answered
vulto
suddenly
losing
all
his
sarcastic
quality
and
becoming
a
very
junior
partner
i
was
just
engaged
with
he
paused
to
glance
at
his
desk
machin
whose
singular
letter
we
received
this
morning
about
an
alleged
option
on
the
lease
of
the
chapel
site
at
piccadilly
circus
the
woldo
estate
sir
you
remember
sir
this
the
man
inquired
slosson
of
the
law
society
with
a
jerk
of
the
thumb
edward
henry
said
this
is
the
man
well
said
slosson
lifting
his
chin
and
still
puffing
it
would
be
extremely
interesting
to
hear
his
story
at
any
rate
i
was
just
telling
wrissell
about
it
come
this
way
sir
i
heard
some
strange
things
in
my
time
but
he
stopped
please
follow
me
sir
he
ordained
i
dashed
if
i
follow
you
edward
henry
desired
to
say
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
say
it
and
because
he
was
angry
with
himself
he
determined
to
make
matters
as
unpleasant
as
possible
for
the
innocent
slosson
who
was
so
used
to
bullying
and
so
well
paid
for
bullying
that
really
no
blame
could
be
apportioned
to
him
it
would
have
been
as
reasonable
to
censure
an
ordinary
person
for
breathing
as
to
censure
slosson
for
bullying
and
so
edward
henry
was
steeling
himself
i
do
him
in
the
eye
for
that
even
if
it
costs
me
every
cent
i
got
a
statement
characterized
by
poetical
license
iii
slosson
senior
heard
edward
henry
story
but
seemingly
did
not
find
it
quite
as
interesting
as
he
had
prophesied
it
would
be
when
edward
henry
had
finished
the
old
man
drummed
on
an
enormous
table
and
said
yes
yes
and
then
his
manner
was
far
less
bullying
than
in
the
room
of
vulto
it
your
turn
now
slosson
said
edward
henry
my
turn
how
to
go
on
with
the
story
he
glanced
at
the
clock
i
brought
it
up
to
date
this
morning
and
as
slosson
continued
to
drum
on
the
table
and
to
look
out
of
the
window
edward
henry
also
drummed
on
the
table
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
chamber
of
the
senior
partner
was
a
very
different
matter
from
vulto
it
was
immense
it
was
not
disfigured
by
japanned
boxes
inartistically
lettered
in
white
as
are
most
lawyer
offices
indeed
in
aspect
it
resembled
one
of
the
cosier
rooms
in
a
small
and
decaying
but
still
comfortable
club
it
had
easy
chairs
and
cigar
boxes
moreover
the
sun
got
into
it
and
there
was
a
view
of
the
comic
yet
stately
victorian
gothic
of
the
law
courts
the
sun
enheartened
edward
henry
and
he
felt
secure
in
an
unimpugnable
suit
of
clothes
in
the
shape
of
his
collar
the
colour
of
his
necktie
the
style
of
his
creaseless
boots
and
in
the
protuberance
of
his
in
his
pocket
as
slosson
had
failed
to
notice
the
competition
of
his
drumming
he
drummed
still
louder
whereupon
slosson
stopped
drumming
edward
henry
gazed
amiably
around
right
at
the
back
of
the
room
before
a
that
gave
on
the
whitewashed
wall
a
man
was
rapidly
putting
his
signature
to
a
number
of
papers
but
slosson
had
ignored
the
existence
of
this
man
treating
him
apparently
as
a
figment
of
the
disordered
brain
or
as
an
optical
illusion
i
nothing
to
say
said
slosson
or
to
do
or
to
do
well
slosson
said
edward
henry
your
junior
partner
has
already
outlined
your
policy
of
masterly
inactivity
so
i
may
as
well
go
i
did
say
i
go
to
my
solicitors
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
as
i
a
principal
i
may
as
well
first
of
all
see
the
principals
on
the
other
side
i
only
came
here
because
it
mentions
in
the
option
that
the
matter
is
to
be
completed
here
that
all
you
a
principal
exclaimed
slosson
it
seems
to
me
you
a
long
way
removed
from
a
principal
the
alleged
option
is
given
to
a
miss
rose
euclid
excuse
me
miss
rose
euclid
miss
rose
euclid
she
divides
up
her
alleged
interest
into
fractions
and
sells
them
here
and
there
and
you
buy
them
up
one
after
another
slosson
laughed
not
unamiably
you
a
principal
about
five
times
removed
well
said
edward
henry
whatever
i
am
i
have
a
sort
of
idea
go
and
see
this
gristle
or
wrissell
can
you
the
man
at
the
distant
desk
turned
his
head
slosson
coughed
the
man
rose
this
is
wrissel
said
slosson
with
a
gesture
from
which
confusion
was
not
absent
good
morning
said
the
advancing
rollo
wrissell
and
he
said
it
with
an
accent
more
kensingtonian
than
any
accent
that
edward
henry
had
ever
heard
his
lounging
and
yet
elegant
walk
assorted
well
with
the
accent
his
black
clothes
were
loose
and
untidy
such
boots
as
his
could
not
have
been
worn
by
edward
henry
even
in
the
five
towns
without
blushing
shame
and
his
necktie
looked
as
if
a
baby
or
a
puppy
had
been
playing
with
it
nevertheless
these
shortcomings
made
absolutely
no
difference
whatever
to
the
impressivness
of
rollo
wrissell
who
was
famous
for
having
said
once
i
put
on
whatever
comes
to
hand
first
and
people
do
seem
to
mind
rollo
wrissell
belonged
to
one
of
the
seven
great
families
which
once
governed
and
by
the
way
still
do
govern
england
scotland
and
ireland
the
members
of
these
families
may
be
divided
into
two
species
those
who
rule
and
those
who
are
too
lofty
in
spirit
even
to
rule
those
who
exist
rollo
wrissell
belonged
to
the
latter
species
his
nose
and
mouth
had
the
exquisite
refinement
of
the
descendant
of
generations
of
and
he
enjoyed
life
but
not
with
rude
activity
like
the
grosser
members
of
the
ruling
caste
rather
with
a
certain
rare
languor
he
sniffed
and
savoured
the
whole
spherical
surface
of
the
apple
of
life
with
those
delicate
nostrils
rather
than
bit
into
it
his
one
conviction
was
that
in
a
properly
managed
world
nothing
ought
to
occur
to
disturb
or
agitate
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
his
existing
and
this
conviction
was
so
profound
so
visible
even
in
his
lightest
gesture
and
glance
that
it
exerted
a
mystic
influence
over
the
entire
social
organism
with
the
result
that
practically
nothing
ever
did
occur
to
disturb
or
agitate
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
rollo
existing
for
rollo
wrissell
the
world
was
indeed
almost
ideal
edward
henry
breathed
to
himself
this
is
the
genuine
article
and
being
an
englishman
he
was
far
more
impressed
by
wrissell
than
he
had
been
by
the
much
vaster
reputations
of
rose
euclid
seven
sachs
and
slosson
senior
at
the
same
time
he
inwardly
fought
against
wrissell
silent
and
unconscious
dominion
over
him
and
all
the
defiant
midland
belief
that
one
body
is
as
good
as
anybody
else
surged
up
in
him
but
stopped
at
his
lips
please
do
rise
wrissell
entreated
waving
both
hands
very
sorry
to
hear
of
this
unhappy
complication
he
went
on
to
edward
henry
with
the
most
adorable
and
winning
politeness
it
pains
me
his
martyred
expression
said
and
really
i
ought
not
to
be
pained
i
quite
convinced
that
you
are
here
in
absolute
good
faith
the
most
absolute
good
faith
machin
suggested
slosson
ah
pardon
me
machin
and
naturally
in
the
management
of
enormous
estates
such
as
lord
woldo
little
difficulties
are
apt
to
occur
i
sorry
you
been
put
in
a
false
position
you
have
all
my
sympathies
but
of
course
you
understand
that
in
this
particular
case
i
myself
have
taken
up
the
lease
from
the
estate
i
happen
to
be
interested
in
a
great
movement
the
plans
of
my
church
have
been
passed
by
the
county
council
building
operations
have
indeed
begun
oh
chuck
it
said
edward
henry
inexcusably
but
such
were
his
words
a
surfeit
of
wrissell
calm
egotism
and
accent
and
fatigued
harmonious
gestures
drove
him
to
commit
this
outrage
upon
the
very
fabric
of
civilization
wrissell
if
he
had
ever
met
with
the
phrase
which
is
doubtful
had
certainly
never
heard
it
addressed
to
himself
conceivably
he
might
have
once
come
across
it
in
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
slang
dictionary
a
tragic
expression
traversed
his
bewildered
features
and
then
he
recovered
himself
somewhat
i
go
and
bury
yourself
said
edward
henry
with
increased
savagery
wrissell
having
comprehended
went
he
really
did
go
he
could
not
tolerate
scenes
and
his
glance
showed
that
any
forcible
derangement
of
his
habit
of
existing
smoothly
would
nakedly
disclose
the
unyielding
adamantine
selfishness
that
was
the
basis
of
the
wrissell
philosophy
his
glance
was
at
least
harsh
and
bitter
he
went
in
silence
and
rapidly
slosson
senior
followed
him
at
a
great
pace
edward
henry
was
angry
strange
though
it
may
seem
the
chief
cause
of
his
anger
was
the
fact
that
his
own
manners
and
breeding
were
lower
coarser
clumsier
more
brutal
than
wrissell
after
what
appeared
to
be
a
considerable
absence
slosson
senior
returned
into
the
room
edward
henry
steeped
in
peculiar
meditations
was
repeating
so
this
is
slosson
what
that
demanded
slosson
with
a
challenge
in
his
ancient
but
powerful
voice
nowt
said
edward
henry
now
sir
said
slosson
we
better
come
to
an
understanding
about
this
option
it
not
serious
you
know
you
find
it
is
it
not
commercial
i
fancy
it
is
for
me
said
edward
henry
the
premium
mentioned
is
absurdly
inadequate
and
the
is
quite
improperly
low
that
just
why
i
look
on
it
as
commercial
from
my
point
of
view
said
edward
henry
it
is
worth
the
paper
it
written
on
said
slosson
why
because
seeing
the
unusual
form
of
it
it
ought
to
be
stamped
and
it
is
stamped
listen
here
slosson
said
edward
henry
i
want
you
to
remember
that
you
talking
to
a
lawyer
a
lawyer
i
was
in
the
law
for
years
said
edward
henry
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
i
can
get
the
option
stamped
at
any
time
by
paying
a
penalty
which
at
worst
will
be
a
trifle
compared
to
the
value
of
the
option
ah
slosson
paused
and
resumed
his
puffing
which
exercise
perhaps
owing
to
undue
excitement
he
had
pretermitted
then
further
the
deed
is
drawn
up
that
not
my
fault
further
the
option
is
not
transferable
we
shall
see
about
that
and
the
money
ought
to
be
paid
down
even
on
your
own
showing
every
cent
of
it
in
cash
here
is
the
money
said
edward
henry
drawing
his
from
his
breast
every
cent
of
it
in
the
finest
brand
of
he
flung
down
the
notes
with
the
impulsive
gesture
of
an
artist
then
with
the
caution
of
a
man
of
the
world
gathered
them
in
again
the
whole
circumstances
under
which
the
alleged
option
is
alleged
to
have
been
given
would
have
to
be
examined
said
slosson
i
sha
mind
said
edward
henry
others
might
there
is
such
a
thing
as
undue
influence
miss
euclid
is
fifty
if
she
a
day
replied
edward
henry
i
do
see
what
miss
euclid
age
has
to
do
with
the
matter
then
your
eyesight
must
be
defective
mr
slosson
the
document
might
be
a
forgery
it
might
but
i
got
an
autograph
letter
written
entirely
in
the
late
lord
woldo
hand
enclosing
the
option
let
me
see
it
please
certainly
but
in
a
court
of
law
said
edward
henry
you
know
you
hungry
for
a
good
action
followed
by
a
bill
of
costs
as
long
as
from
here
to
jericho
wrissell
will
assuredly
fight
said
slosson
he
has
already
given
me
the
most
explicit
instructions
wrissell
objection
to
a
certain
class
of
theatres
is
well
known
and
does
wrissell
settle
everything
wrissell
and
lady
woldo
settle
everything
between
them
and
lady
woldo
is
guided
by
wrissell
there
is
an
impression
abroad
that
because
lady
woldo
was
originally
connected
er
with
the
stage
she
and
wrissell
are
not
entirely
at
one
in
the
conduct
of
her
and
her
son
interests
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
fact
edward
henry
thoughts
dwelt
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
late
lord
woldo
picturesque
and
marriage
can
you
give
me
lady
woldo
address
i
ca
said
slosson
after
an
instant
hesitation
you
mean
you
wo
slosson
pursed
his
lips
well
you
can
do
the
other
thing
said
edward
henry
insolent
to
the
last
as
he
left
the
premises
he
found
rollo
wrissell
and
his
own
new
acquaintance
alloyd
the
architect
chatting
in
the
portico
wrissell
was
calm
bland
and
attentive
alloyd
was
eager
excited
and
deferential
edward
henry
caught
the
words
russian
ballet
he
reflected
upon
an
abstract
question
oddly
disconnected
with
the
violent
welter
of
his
sensations
can
a
man
be
a
good
practical
architect
who
is
able
to
sleep
because
he
seen
a
russian
ballet
the
alert
chauffeur
of
the
electric
brougham
who
had
an
excellent
idea
of
effect
brought
the
admirable
vehicle
to
the
kerb
exactly
in
front
of
edward
henry
as
edward
henry
reached
the
edge
of
the
pavement
ejaculating
a
brief
command
edward
henry
disappeared
within
the
vehicle
and
was
whirled
away
in
a
style
whose
perfection
no
scion
of
a
governing
family
could
have
bettered
iv
the
next
scene
in
the
exciting
drama
of
edward
henry
existence
that
day
took
place
in
a
building
as
huge
as
wilkins
itself
as
the
brougham
halted
at
its
portals
an
old
and
medalled
man
rushed
forth
touched
his
cap
and
assisted
edward
henry
to
alight
within
the
groined
and
echoing
hall
of
the
establishment
a
young
boy
sprang
out
and
with
every
circumstance
of
deference
took
edward
henry
hat
and
stick
edward
henry
then
walked
a
few
steps
to
a
lift
and
said
to
another
menial
who
bowed
humbly
before
him
and
at
the
proper
moment
bowed
him
out
of
the
lift
edward
henry
crossing
a
marble
floor
next
entered
an
enormous
marble
apartment
chiefly
populated
by
and
tables
he
sat
down
to
a
table
and
fiercely
rang
a
bell
which
reposed
thereon
several
of
her
menials
simultaneously
appeared
out
of
invisibility
and
one
of
them
hurried
obsequiously
towards
him
bring
me
a
glass
of
water
and
a
peerage
said
edward
henry
i
beg
pardon
sir
a
glass
of
water
and
a
peerage
p
double
e
r
a
g
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
did
catch
which
peerage
sir
we
have
several
all
of
them
in
a
hundred
seconds
the
last
menial
having
thanked
him
for
kindly
taking
the
glass
and
the
pile
of
books
edward
henry
was
sipping
water
and
studying
peerages
in
two
hundred
seconds
he
was
off
again
a
menial
opened
the
of
the
for
him
and
bowed
the
menial
of
the
lift
bowed
wafted
him
downwards
and
bowed
the
infant
menial
produced
his
hat
and
stick
and
bowed
the
old
and
medalled
menial
summoned
his
brougham
with
a
frown
at
the
chauffeur
and
a
smile
at
edward
henry
bowed
opened
the
door
of
the
brougham
helped
edward
henry
in
bowed
and
shut
the
door
where
to
sir
eaton
square
said
edward
henry
thank
you
sir
said
the
aged
menial
and
repeated
in
a
curt
and
peremptory
voice
to
the
chauffeur
eaton
square
lastly
he
touched
his
cap
and
edward
henry
swiftly
left
the
precincts
of
the
headquarters
of
political
democracy
in
london
v
as
he
came
within
striking
distance
of
eaton
square
he
had
the
advantage
of
an
unusual
and
brilliant
spectacle
lord
woldo
was
one
of
the
richest
human
beings
in
england
and
incidentally
he
was
very
human
if
he
had
been
in
a
position
to
realize
all
his
assets
and
go
to
america
with
the
ready
money
his
wealth
was
such
that
even
amid
the
luxurious
society
of
pittsburg
he
could
have
cut
quite
a
figure
for
some
time
he
owned
a
great
deal
of
the
land
between
oxford
street
and
regent
street
and
again
a
number
of
the
valuable
squares
north
of
oxford
street
were
his
and
as
for
edgware
road
just
as
auctioneers
advertise
a
couple
of
miles
of
or
as
a
pleasing
adjunct
to
a
country
estate
so
had
lord
woldo
estate
come
under
the
hammer
a
couple
of
miles
of
edgware
road
might
have
been
advertised
as
among
its
charms
lord
woldo
owned
four
theatres
and
to
each
theatre
he
had
his
private
entrance
and
in
each
theatre
his
private
box
over
which
the
management
had
no
sway
the
woldos
in
their
leases
had
always
insisted
on
this
he
never
built
in
london
his
business
was
to
let
land
for
others
to
build
upon
the
condition
being
that
what
others
built
should
ultimately
belong
to
him
thousands
of
people
in
london
were
only
too
delighted
to
build
on
these
terms
he
could
pick
and
choose
his
builders
the
astute
edward
henry
himself
for
example
wanted
furiously
to
build
for
him
and
was
angry
because
obstacles
stood
in
the
path
of
his
desire
it
was
constantly
happening
that
under
legal
agreements
some
fine
erection
put
up
by
another
hand
came
into
the
absolute
possession
of
lord
waldo
without
one
halfpenny
of
expense
to
lord
woldo
now
and
then
a
whole
street
would
thus
tumble
all
complete
into
his
hands
the
system
most
agreeable
for
lord
woldo
and
about
a
dozen
other
landlords
in
london
was
called
the
leasehold
system
and
when
lord
woldo
became
the
proprietor
of
some
bricks
and
mortar
that
had
cost
him
nothing
it
was
said
that
one
of
lord
woldo
leases
had
fallen
in
and
everybody
was
quite
satisfied
by
this
phrase
in
the
provinces
besides
castles
forests
and
moors
lord
woldo
owned
many
acres
of
land
under
which
was
coal
and
he
allowed
enterprising
persons
to
dig
deep
for
this
coal
and
often
explode
themselves
to
death
in
the
adventure
on
the
understanding
that
they
paid
him
sixpence
for
every
ton
of
coal
brought
to
the
surface
whether
they
made
any
profit
on
it
or
not
this
arrangement
was
called
mining
rights
another
phrase
that
apparently
satisfied
everybody
it
might
be
thought
that
lord
woldo
was
as
they
say
on
velvet
but
the
velvet
if
it
could
be
so
described
was
not
of
so
rich
and
comfortable
a
pile
after
all
for
lord
woldo
situation
involved
many
and
heavy
responsibilities
and
was
surrounded
by
grave
dangers
he
was
the
representative
of
an
old
order
going
down
in
the
unforeseeable
welter
of
politics
numbers
of
thoughtful
students
of
english
conditions
spent
much
of
their
time
in
wondering
what
would
happen
one
day
to
the
lord
woldos
of
england
and
when
a
really
great
strike
came
and
a
dozen
met
in
a
private
room
of
a
west
end
hotel
and
decided
without
consulting
lord
woldo
or
the
prime
minister
or
anybody
that
the
commerce
of
the
country
should
be
brought
to
a
standstill
these
thoughtful
students
perceived
that
even
lord
woldo
situation
was
no
more
secure
than
other
people
in
fact
that
it
was
rather
less
so
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
circumstances
of
lord
woldo
furnished
him
with
food
for
thought
and
very
indigestible
food
too
why
at
least
one
hundred
sprightly
female
creatures
were
being
brought
up
in
the
hope
of
marrying
him
and
they
would
all
besiege
him
and
he
could
only
marry
one
of
them
at
once
now
as
edward
henry
stopped
as
near
to
no
as
the
presence
of
a
waiting
carriage
permitted
he
saw
a
and
woman
solemnly
descending
the
steps
of
the
portico
of
no
she
was
followed
by
another
similar
woman
and
watched
by
a
butler
and
a
footman
at
the
summit
of
the
steps
and
by
a
footman
on
the
pavement
and
by
the
coachman
on
the
box
of
the
carriage
she
carried
a
thick
and
lovely
white
shawl
and
in
this
shawl
was
lord
woldo
and
all
his
many
and
heavy
responsibilities
it
was
his
fancy
to
take
the
air
thus
in
the
arms
of
a
woman
he
allowed
himself
to
be
lifted
into
the
open
carriage
and
the
door
of
the
carriage
was
shut
and
off
went
the
two
ancient
horses
slowly
and
the
two
adult
fat
men
and
the
two
mature
spinsters
and
the
vehicle
weighing
about
a
ton
and
lord
woldo
morning
promenade
had
begun
follow
that
said
edward
henry
to
the
chauffeur
and
nipped
into
his
brougham
again
nobody
had
told
him
that
the
being
in
the
shawl
was
lord
woldo
but
he
was
sure
that
it
must
be
so
in
twenty
minutes
he
saw
lord
woldo
being
carried
to
and
fro
amid
the
groves
of
hyde
park
one
of
the
few
bits
of
london
earth
that
did
not
belong
to
him
or
to
his
more
or
less
distant
connections
while
the
carriage
waited
once
lord
woldo
sat
on
a
chair
but
the
chief
lap
was
between
him
and
the
both
nurses
chattered
to
him
in
kensingtonian
accents
but
he
offered
no
replies
go
back
to
said
edward
henry
to
his
chauffeur
arrived
again
in
eaton
square
he
did
not
give
himself
time
to
be
imposed
upon
by
the
grandiosity
of
the
square
in
general
nor
of
no
in
particular
he
just
ran
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
after
all
he
said
to
himself
as
he
waited
these
houses
even
they
just
houses
in
a
row
and
i
bet
every
one
of
can
hear
the
piano
next
door
the
butler
whom
he
had
previously
caught
sight
of
opened
the
great
portal
i
want
to
see
lady
woldo
her
ladyship
began
the
formidable
official
now
look
here
my
man
said
edward
henry
rather
in
desperation
i
must
see
lady
woldo
instantly
it
about
the
baby
about
his
lordship
yes
and
look
lively
please
he
stepped
into
the
sombre
and
sumptuous
hall
well
he
reflected
i
going
it
no
mistake
vi
he
was
in
a
large
back
of
which
the
window
looking
north
was
in
rich
stained
glass
no
doubt
because
they
ashamed
of
the
view
he
said
to
himself
the
size
of
the
chimneypiece
impressed
him
and
also
its
rich
carving
but
what
an
grate
he
said
to
himself
they
need
gilt
radiators
here
the
doorway
was
a
marvel
of
ornate
sculpture
and
he
liked
it
he
liked
too
the
effect
of
the
mainly
portraits
on
the
walls
and
the
immensity
of
the
brass
fender
and
the
rugs
and
the
of
the
chairs
but
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
room
was
too
dark
for
the
taste
of
any
householder
clever
enough
to
know
the
difference
between
a
house
and
a
church
there
was
a
plunging
noise
at
the
door
behind
him
what
amiss
he
heard
a
woman
voice
and
as
he
heard
it
he
thrilled
with
sympathetic
vibrations
it
was
not
a
north
staffordshire
voice
but
it
was
a
south
yorkshire
voice
which
is
almost
the
same
thing
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
first
voice
to
soothe
his
ear
since
he
had
left
the
five
towns
moreover
nobody
born
south
of
the
trent
would
have
said
what
amiss
a
southerner
would
have
said
what
the
matter
or
more
probably
what
the
mattah
he
turned
and
saw
a
breathless
and
very
beautiful
woman
of
about
or
thirty
clothed
in
black
and
she
was
in
the
act
of
removing
from
her
lovely
head
what
looked
like
a
length
of
red
flannel
he
noticed
too
simultaneously
that
she
was
suffering
from
a
heavy
cold
a
majestic
footman
behind
her
closed
the
door
and
disappeared
are
you
lady
woldo
edward
henry
asked
yes
she
said
what
this
about
my
baby
i
just
seen
him
in
hyde
park
said
edward
henry
and
i
observed
that
a
rash
had
broken
out
all
over
his
face
i
know
that
she
replied
it
began
this
morning
all
of
a
sudden
like
but
what
of
it
i
was
rather
alarmed
myself
as
it
the
first
rash
he
had
and
he
the
first
baby
i
had
and
he
be
the
last
too
but
everybody
said
it
was
nothing
he
never
been
out
without
me
before
but
i
had
such
a
cold
now
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
come
down
specially
from
hyde
park
to
inform
me
about
that
rash
i
not
such
a
simpleton
as
all
that
she
spoke
in
one
long
breath
i
sure
you
not
said
he
but
we
had
a
good
deal
of
rash
in
our
family
and
it
just
happens
that
i
got
a
remedy
a
good
sound
remedy
and
it
struck
me
you
might
like
to
know
of
it
so
if
you
like
i
telegraph
to
my
missis
for
the
recipe
here
my
card
she
read
his
name
title
and
address
well
she
said
it
very
kind
of
you
i
sure
machin
i
knew
you
must
come
from
up
there
the
moment
ye
spoke
it
does
one
good
above
a
bit
to
hear
a
plain
voice
after
all
this
she
blew
her
lovely
nose
does
it
edward
henry
agreed
that
was
just
what
i
thought
when
i
heard
you
say
us
do
you
know
i
been
in
london
only
a
days
and
i
assure
you
i
was
beginning
to
feel
lonely
for
a
bit
of
the
midland
accent
yes
she
said
london
lonely
and
sighed
my
eldest
was
bitten
by
a
dog
the
other
day
he
went
on
in
the
vein
of
gossip
oh
do
she
protested
yes
gave
us
a
lot
of
anxiety
all
right
now
you
might
like
to
know
that
cyanide
gauze
is
a
good
thing
to
put
on
a
wound
supposing
anything
should
happen
to
yours
oh
do
she
protested
i
do
hope
and
pray
robert
will
never
be
bitten
by
a
dog
was
it
a
big
dog
fair
said
edward
henry
so
his
name
robert
so
my
eldest
really
now
they
wanted
him
to
be
called
robert
philip
stephen
darrand
patrick
but
i
would
have
it
he
just
robert
i
did
have
my
own
way
you
know
he
was
born
six
months
after
his
death
and
i
suppose
he
ten
months
now
no
only
six
great
scott
he
big
said
edward
henry
well
said
she
he
is
i
am
you
see
now
lady
woldo
said
edward
henry
in
a
new
tone
as
we
both
from
the
same
part
of
the
country
i
want
to
be
perfectly
straight
and
with
you
it
quite
true
all
that
about
the
rash
and
i
did
think
you
like
to
know
but
that
not
really
what
i
came
to
see
you
about
you
understand
not
knowing
you
i
fancied
there
might
be
some
difficulty
in
getting
at
you
oh
no
she
said
simply
everybody
gets
at
me
well
i
did
know
you
see
so
i
just
mentioned
the
baby
to
begin
with
like
i
hope
you
not
after
money
she
said
almost
plaintively
i
not
he
said
you
can
ask
anybody
in
bursley
or
hanbridge
whether
i
the
sort
of
man
to
go
out
on
the
cadge
i
once
was
in
the
chorus
in
a
panto
at
hanbridge
she
said
they
call
bursley
down
there
bosley
edward
henry
dealt
suitably
with
these
remarks
and
then
gave
her
a
judicious
version
of
the
nature
of
his
business
referring
several
times
to
rollo
wrissell
mr
wrissell
she
murmured
smiling
in
the
end
i
told
wrissell
to
go
and
bury
himself
said
edward
henry
and
that
about
as
far
as
i
got
oh
do
she
said
her
voice
weak
from
suppressed
laughter
and
then
the
laughter
burst
forth
uncontrollable
yes
he
said
delighted
with
himself
and
her
i
told
him
to
go
and
bury
himself
i
suppose
you
do
like
mr
wrissell
well
he
temporized
i
did
at
first
she
said
i
hated
him
but
i
like
him
now
though
i
must
say
i
adore
teasing
him
wrissell
is
what
i
call
a
gentleman
you
know
he
was
lord
woldo
heir
and
when
lord
woldo
married
me
it
was
a
bit
of
a
blow
for
him
but
he
took
it
like
a
lamb
he
never
turned
a
hair
and
he
was
more
polite
than
any
of
them
i
daresay
you
know
lord
woldo
saw
me
in
a
musical
comedy
at
scarborough
he
has
a
place
near
there
ye
know
wrissell
had
made
him
angry
about
some
of
his
new
thought
fads
and
i
do
believe
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
just
to
annoy
wrissell
he
used
to
say
to
me
my
husband
did
that
he
married
me
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
and
that
it
was
too
bad
on
wrissell
and
then
he
laughed
and
i
laughed
too
all
he
used
to
say
my
husband
did
marry
an
actress
is
an
accident
that
might
happen
to
any
member
of
the
house
of
lords
and
it
does
happen
to
a
lot
of
but
they
do
marry
anything
as
beautiful
as
you
blanche
he
used
to
say
you
stick
up
for
yourself
blanche
he
used
to
say
stand
by
you
he
said
he
was
a
straight
my
husband
was
they
left
me
alone
until
he
died
and
then
they
began
i
mean
his
folks
and
when
bobbie
was
born
it
got
worse
only
i
must
say
even
then
wrissell
never
turned
a
hair
everybody
seemed
to
make
out
that
i
ought
to
be
very
grateful
to
them
and
i
ought
to
think
myself
very
lucky
me
a
peeress
of
the
realm
they
wanted
me
to
change
but
how
could
i
change
i
was
blanche
wilmot
on
the
road
for
ten
years
never
got
a
show
in
london
and
blanche
wilmot
i
shall
ever
be
peeress
or
no
peeress
it
was
no
joke
being
lord
woldo
wife
i
can
tell
you
and
it
still
less
of
a
joke
being
lord
woldo
mother
you
imagine
it
it
worse
than
carrying
about
a
china
vase
all
the
time
on
a
slippery
floor
am
i
any
happier
now
than
i
was
before
i
married
well
i
there
more
worry
in
one
way
but
there
less
in
another
and
of
course
i
got
bobbie
but
it
is
all
beer
and
skittles
and
i
let
know
it
too
i
ca
do
what
i
like
and
i
just
a
sort
of
exile
you
know
i
used
to
enjoy
being
on
the
stage
and
showing
myself
off
a
hard
life
but
one
does
enjoy
it
and
one
gets
used
to
it
one
gets
to
need
it
sometimes
i
feel
i
give
anything
to
be
able
to
go
on
the
stage
again
oh
oh
she
sneezed
then
took
breath
shall
i
put
some
more
coal
on
the
fire
edward
henry
suggested
perhaps
i
better
ring
she
hesitated
no
i
do
it
he
put
coal
on
the
fire
and
if
you
feel
easier
with
that
flannel
round
your
head
please
do
put
it
on
again
well
she
said
i
will
my
mother
used
to
say
there
was
naught
like
red
flannel
for
a
cold
with
an
actress
skill
she
arranged
the
flannel
and
from
its
encircling
folds
her
face
emerged
bewitching
and
she
knew
it
her
complexion
had
suffered
in
ten
years
of
the
road
but
its
extreme
beauty
could
not
yet
be
denied
and
edward
henry
thought
all
the
pretty
girls
come
from
the
midlands
here
i
am
rambling
on
she
said
i
always
was
a
rare
rambler
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
exert
your
influence
he
replied
do
you
think
it
rather
hard
on
rose
euclid
treating
her
like
this
of
course
people
say
all
sorts
of
things
about
rose
euclid
i
wo
hear
a
word
against
rose
euclid
cried
lady
woldo
whenever
she
was
on
tour
if
she
knew
any
of
us
were
resting
in
the
town
where
she
was
she
send
us
seats
and
many
the
time
i
cried
and
cried
at
her
acting
and
then
she
the
life
and
soul
of
the
theatrical
ladies
guild
and
is
that
your
husband
signature
he
demanded
showing
the
precious
option
of
course
it
is
he
did
not
show
her
the
covering
letter
and
i
no
doubt
my
husband
a
theatre
built
there
and
he
wanted
to
do
rose
euclid
a
good
turn
and
i
quite
positive
certain
sure
that
he
did
want
any
of
wrissell
rigmaroles
on
his
land
he
was
that
sort
my
husband
was
you
must
go
to
law
about
it
she
finished
yes
said
edward
henry
protestingly
and
a
pretty
penny
it
would
cost
me
and
supposing
i
lost
after
all
you
never
know
there
a
much
easier
way
than
going
to
law
what
is
it
as
i
say
you
exert
your
influence
lady
woldo
write
and
tell
them
i
seen
you
and
you
insist
eh
bless
you
they
twist
me
round
their
little
finger
i
not
a
fool
but
i
not
very
clever
i
know
that
i
should
know
whether
i
was
standing
on
my
head
or
my
heels
by
the
time
they
done
with
me
i
tried
to
face
them
out
before
about
things
who
wrissell
or
slossons
both
eh
but
i
should
like
to
put
a
spoke
in
wheel
gentleman
as
he
is
you
see
he
just
one
of
those
men
you
ca
help
wanting
to
tease
when
you
on
the
road
you
meet
lots
of
i
tell
you
what
you
can
do
what
write
and
tell
slossons
that
you
do
wish
them
to
act
for
you
any
more
and
you
go
to
another
firm
of
solicitors
that
would
bring
to
their
senses
ca
they
in
the
will
settled
that
that
why
they
so
cocky
edward
henry
persisted
and
this
time
with
an
exceedingly
impressive
and
conspiratorial
air
i
tell
you
another
thing
you
could
do
you
really
do
and
it
depends
on
nobody
but
yourself
well
she
said
with
decision
i
do
it
whatever
it
is
if
it
straight
of
course
it
straight
and
it
would
be
a
grand
way
of
teasing
wrissell
and
all
of
a
simply
grand
way
i
should
die
of
laughing
well
at
this
critical
point
the
historic
conversation
was
interrupted
by
phenomena
in
the
hall
which
lady
woldo
recognized
with
feverish
excitement
lord
woldo
had
safely
returned
from
hyde
park
starting
up
she
invited
edward
henry
to
wait
a
little
a
few
moments
later
they
were
bending
over
the
infant
together
and
edward
henry
was
offering
his
views
on
the
cause
and
cure
of
rash
vii
early
on
the
same
afternoon
edward
henry
managed
by
a
somewhat
excessive
obstreperousness
to
penetrate
once
more
into
the
private
room
of
slosson
senior
who
received
him
in
silence
he
passed
a
document
to
slosson
it
only
a
copy
he
said
but
the
original
is
in
my
pocket
and
it
will
be
duly
stamped
i
give
you
the
original
in
exchange
for
the
stamped
lease
of
my
piccadilly
circus
plot
of
land
you
know
the
money
is
waiting
slosson
perused
the
document
and
it
was
certainly
to
his
credit
that
he
did
so
without
any
superficial
symptoms
of
dismay
what
will
wrissell
and
the
woldo
family
say
about
that
do
you
think
asked
edward
henry
lady
woldo
will
never
be
allowed
to
carry
it
out
said
slosson
who
going
to
stop
her
she
must
carry
it
out
she
wants
to
carry
it
out
she
dying
to
carry
it
out
moreover
i
shall
communicate
it
to
the
papers
unless
you
and
i
come
to
an
arrangement
and
if
by
any
chance
she
does
carry
it
out
well
there
be
a
fine
society
action
about
it
you
can
bet
your
boots
mr
slosson
the
document
was
a
contract
made
between
blanche
lady
woldo
of
the
one
part
and
edward
henry
machin
of
the
other
part
whereby
blanche
lady
woldo
undertook
to
appear
in
musical
comedy
at
any
west
end
theatre
to
be
named
by
edward
henry
at
a
salary
of
two
hundred
pounds
a
week
for
a
period
of
six
months
you
not
got
a
theatre
said
slosson
i
can
get
half
a
dozen
in
an
hour
with
that
contract
in
my
hand
said
edward
henry
and
he
knew
from
slosson
face
that
he
had
won
viii
that
evening
feeling
that
he
had
earned
a
little
recreation
he
went
to
the
empire
theatre
not
in
hanbridge
but
in
leicester
square
london
the
lease
with
a
prodigious
speed
hitherto
unknown
at
slossons
had
been
drawn
up
engrossed
and
executed
the
piccadilly
circus
land
was
his
for
years
and
i
got
the
old
chapel
pulled
down
for
nothing
he
said
to
himself
he
was
rather
happy
as
he
wandered
about
amid
the
brilliance
of
the
empire
promenade
but
after
half
an
hour
of
such
exercise
and
of
vain
efforts
to
see
or
hear
what
was
afoot
on
the
stage
he
began
to
feel
rather
lonely
then
it
was
that
he
caught
sight
of
alloyd
the
architect
also
lonely
well
said
alloyd
curtly
with
a
sardonic
smile
telephoned
me
all
about
it
i
seen
wrissell
just
my
luck
so
you
the
man
he
pointed
you
out
to
me
this
morning
my
design
for
that
church
would
have
knocked
the
west
end
of
course
wrissell
will
pay
me
compensation
but
that
not
the
same
thing
i
wanted
the
advertisement
of
the
building
just
my
luck
have
a
drink
will
you
edward
henry
ultimately
went
with
the
plaintive
alloyd
to
his
rooms
in
adelphi
terrace
he
quitted
those
rooms
at
something
after
two
in
the
morning
he
had
practically
given
alloyd
a
definite
commission
to
design
the
regent
theatre
already
he
was
practically
the
proprietor
of
a
theatre
in
the
west
end
of
london
i
wonder
whether
master
seven
sachs
could
have
bettered
my
day
work
he
reflected
as
he
got
into
a
he
had
dismissed
his
electric
brougham
earlier
in
the
evening
i
doubt
if
even
master
seven
sachs
himself
would
be
proud
of
my
little
scheme

chapter
vii
i
on
a
morning
in
spring
edward
henry
got
out
of
an
express
at
euston
which
had
come
not
from
the
five
towns
but
from
birmingham
having
on
the
previous
day
been
called
to
birmingham
on
local
and
profitable
business
he
had
found
it
convenient
to
spend
the
night
there
and
telegraph
home
that
london
had
summoned
him
it
was
in
this
unostentatious
this
fashion
that
his
visits
to
london
now
usually
occurred
not
that
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife
not
that
he
was
afraid
even
of
his
mother
oh
no
he
was
merely
rather
afraid
of
himself
of
his
own
opinion
concerning
the
metropolitan
speculative
and
perhaps
unprofitable
business
to
which
he
was
committed
the
fact
was
that
he
could
scarcely
look
his
women
in
the
face
when
he
mentioned
london
he
spoke
vaguely
of
real
estate
enterprise
and
left
it
at
that
the
women
made
no
inquiries
they
too
left
it
at
that
nevertheless
the
episode
of
wilkins
was
buried
but
it
was
imperfectly
buried
the
five
towns
definitely
knew
that
he
had
stayed
at
wilkins
for
a
bet
and
that
brindley
had
discharged
the
bet
and
rumours
of
his
valet
his
electric
brougham
his
theatrical
had
mysteriously
hung
in
the
streets
of
the
five
towns
like
a
strange
vapour
wisps
of
the
strange
vapour
had
conceivably
entered
the
precincts
of
his
home
but
nobody
ever
referred
to
them
nobody
ever
sniffed
apprehensively
nor
asked
anybody
else
whether
there
was
not
a
smell
of
fire
the
discreetness
of
the
silence
was
disconcerting
happily
his
relations
with
that
angel
his
wife
were
excellent
she
had
carried
angelicism
so
far
as
not
to
insist
on
the
destruction
of
carlo
and
she
had
actually
applauded
while
sticking
to
her
white
apron
the
sudden
and
startling
extravagances
of
his
toilette
on
the
whole
though
little
short
of
thousand
pounds
would
ultimately
be
involved
not
to
speak
of
a
liability
of
nearly
three
thousand
a
year
for
years
for
edward
henry
was
not
entirely
gloomy
as
to
his
prospects
he
was
indubitably
thinner
in
girth
novel
problems
and
anxieties
and
the
constant
annoyance
of
being
in
complete
technical
ignorance
of
his
job
had
removed
some
flesh
and
not
a
bad
thing
either
but
on
the
other
hand
his
chin
exhibited
one
proof
that
life
was
worth
living
and
that
he
had
discovered
new
faith
in
life
and
a
new
conviction
of
youthfulness
he
had
shaved
off
his
beard
well
sir
a
voice
greeted
him
full
of
hope
and
cheer
immediately
his
feet
touched
the
platform
it
was
the
voice
of
marrier
edward
henry
and
marrier
were
now
in
regular
relations
before
edward
henry
had
paid
his
final
bill
at
wilkins
and
relinquished
his
valet
and
his
electric
brougham
and
disposed
for
ever
of
his
mythical
man
on
board
the
minnetonka
and
got
his
original
luggage
away
from
the
hotel
majestic
marrier
had
visited
him
and
made
a
certain
proposition
and
such
was
the
influence
of
marrier
incurable
smile
and
of
his
solid
optimism
and
of
his
obvious
talent
for
getting
things
done
on
the
spot
as
witness
the
photography
that
the
proposition
had
been
accepted
marrier
was
now
edward
henry
representative
in
london
at
the
green
room
club
marrier
informed
reliable
cronies
that
he
was
edward
confidential
adviser
at
the
turk
head
hanbridge
edward
henry
informed
reliable
cronies
that
marrier
was
a
sort
of
clerk
factotum
or
a
compromise
between
these
two
very
different
conceptions
of
marrier
position
had
been
arrived
at
in
the
word
representative
the
real
truth
was
that
edward
henry
employed
marrier
in
order
to
listen
to
marrier
he
turned
on
marrier
like
a
tap
and
nourished
himself
from
a
gushing
stream
of
useful
information
concerning
the
theatrical
world
marrier
quite
unconsciously
was
bit
by
bit
remedying
edward
henry
acute
ignorance
the
question
of
wages
had
caused
edward
henry
some
apprehensions
he
had
learnt
in
a
couple
of
days
that
a
hundred
pounds
a
week
was
a
trifle
on
the
stage
he
had
soon
heard
of
performers
who
worked
for
nominal
salaries
of
forty
and
fifty
a
week
for
a
manager
twenty
pounds
a
week
seemed
to
be
a
usual
figure
but
in
the
five
towns
three
pounds
a
week
is
regarded
as
very
goodish
pay
for
any
and
edward
henry
could
not
rid
himself
all
at
once
of
native
standards
he
had
therefore
with
diffidence
offered
three
pounds
a
week
to
the
aristocratic
marrier
and
marrier
had
not
refused
it
nor
ceased
to
smile
on
three
pounds
a
week
he
haunted
the
best
restaurants
and
other
resorts
and
his
garb
seemed
always
to
be
smarter
than
edward
henry
especially
in
such
details
as
waistcoat
slips
of
course
marrier
had
a
waiting
exactly
opposite
the
coach
from
which
edward
henry
descended
it
was
just
this
kind
of
efficient
attention
that
was
gradually
endearing
him
to
his
employer
how
goes
it
said
edward
henry
curtly
as
they
drove
down
to
the
grand
babylon
hotel
now
edward
henry
regular
headquarters
in
london
said
marrier
i
suppose
you
seen
another
of
got
a
knighthood
no
said
edward
henry
who
he
knew
that
by
marrier
meant
the
great
race
of
gerald
pompey
something
to
do
with
him
being
a
sheriff
in
the
city
you
know
i
bet
you
what
you
laike
he
went
in
for
the
common
council
simply
in
order
to
get
even
with
old
pilgrim
in
fact
i
know
he
did
and
now
a
has
dan
it
a
yes
the
new
city
guild
building
you
knaow
royalty
temple
bar
business
sheriffs
knighthood
there
you
are
oh
said
edward
henry
and
then
after
a
pause
added
pity
ca
have
a
by
the
way
old
pilgrim
in
the
deuce
and
all
of
a
haole
i
heah
it
all
over
the
clubs
in
speaking
of
the
clubs
marrier
always
pronounced
them
with
a
capital
letter
i
told
you
he
was
going
to
sail
from
tilbury
on
his
and
have
a
grand
embarking
ceremony
and
just
laike
him
greatest
advertiser
the
world
ever
saw
well
since
that
boat
was
lost
on
the
goodwins
cora
pryde
has
absolutely
declined
to
sail
from
tilbury
swears
she
join
the
steamer
at
marseilles
and
pilgrim
has
got
to
go
with
her
too
why
well
even
pilgrim
could
have
a
grand
embarking
ceremony
without
his
leading
lady
he
furious
i
hear
why
should
he
go
with
her
why
not
because
he
formally
announced
his
grand
embarking
ceremony
invitations
are
out
barge
from
london
bridge
to
tilbury
and
so
on
what
he
wants
is
a
good
excuse
for
giving
it
up
he
never
be
able
to
admit
that
he
had
to
give
it
up
because
cora
pryde
made
him
he
wants
to
save
his
face
well
said
edward
henry
absently
it
a
queer
world
you
got
me
a
room
at
the
grand
bab
rather
then
let
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
regent
first
said
edward
henry
no
sooner
had
he
expressed
the
wish
than
harrier
neck
curved
round
through
the
window
and
with
three
words
to
the
chauffeur
he
had
deflected
the
course
of
the
taxi
edward
henry
had
an
almost
boyish
curiosity
about
his
edifice
he
would
go
and
give
it
a
glance
at
the
oddest
moments
and
just
now
he
had
a
swift
and
violent
desire
to
behold
it
with
all
speed
the
taxi
shot
down
shaftesbury
avenue
and
swerved
to
the
right
there
it
was
yes
it
really
existed
the
incredible
edifice
of
his
caprice
and
of
alloyd
constructive
imagination
it
had
already
reached
a
height
of
fifteen
feet
and
dozen
of
yards
above
that
cranes
dominated
the
sunlit
air
swinging
loads
of
bricks
in
the
azure
and
scores
of
workmen
crawled
about
beneath
these
monsters
and
he
edward
henry
by
a
single
act
of
volition
was
the
author
of
it
he
slipped
from
the
taxi
penetrated
within
the
wall
of
hoardings
and
gazed
just
gazed
a
wondrous
thing
human
enterprise
and
also
a
terrifying
thing
that
building
might
be
the
tomb
of
his
reputation
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
the
seed
of
a
new
renown
compared
to
which
the
first
would
be
as
naught
he
turned
his
eyes
away
in
fear
yes
in
fear
i
say
he
said
will
sir
john
pilgrim
be
out
of
bed
yet
d
think
he
glanced
at
his
watch
the
hour
was
about
eleven
he
be
at
breakfast
i
going
to
see
him
then
what
his
address
queen
anne
gate
but
do
you
knaow
him
i
do
shall
i
cam
with
you
no
said
edward
henry
shortly
you
go
on
with
my
bags
to
the
grand
bab
and
get
me
another
taxi
i
see
you
in
my
room
at
the
hotel
at
a
quarter
to
one
eh
rather
agreed
marrier
submissive
ii
sole
proprietor
of
the
regent
theatre
these
were
the
words
which
edward
henry
wrote
on
a
and
which
procured
him
immediate
admittance
to
the
unique
spectacle
reputed
to
be
one
of
the
most
enthralling
sights
in
london
of
sir
john
pilgrim
at
breakfast
in
a
very
spacious
of
his
flat
so
celebrated
for
its
gobelins
tapestries
and
its
truly
wonderful
sat
sir
john
pilgrim
at
a
large
hexagonal
mahogany
table
at
one
side
of
the
table
a
small
square
of
white
diaper
was
arranged
and
on
this
square
were
an
apparatus
for
boiling
eggs
another
for
making
toast
and
a
third
for
making
coffee
sir
john
with
the
assistance
of
a
young
chinaman
and
a
who
flitted
around
him
was
indeed
eating
and
drinking
the
vast
remainder
of
the
table
was
gleamingly
bare
save
for
newspapers
and
letters
opened
and
unopened
which
sir
john
tossed
about
opposite
to
him
sat
a
secretary
whose
fluffy
hair
neat
white
and
tender
years
gave
her
an
appearance
of
helpless
fragility
in
front
of
the
powerful
and
ruthless
celebrity
sir
john
left
foot
stuck
out
from
the
table
emerging
from
the
left
half
of
a
lovely
new
pair
of
brown
trousers
and
resting
on
a
piece
of
white
paper
before
this
white
paper
knelt
a
man
in
a
who
was
drawing
an
outline
on
the
paper
round
sir
foot
you
a
bootmaker
are
you
sir
john
was
saying
airily
yes
sir
john
excuse
me
said
sir
john
i
only
wanted
to
be
sure
i
fancied
from
the
way
you
caressed
my
corn
with
that
pencil
that
you
might
be
an
artist
on
one
of
the
illustrated
papers
my
mistake
he
was
bending
down
then
suddenly
straightening
himself
he
called
across
the
room
i
say
givington
did
you
notice
my
pose
then
my
expression
as
i
used
the
word
how
would
that
do
and
edward
henry
now
observed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
a
man
standing
in
front
of
an
easel
and
sketching
somewhat
grossly
thereon
in
charcoal
this
man
said
if
you
wo
bother
me
sir
john
i
wo
bother
you
ah
givington
ah
givington
murmured
sir
john
still
more
airily
at
breakfast
he
was
either
airy
or
nothing
you
getting
on
in
the
world
you
are
merely
an
you
making
money
a
year
ago
you
never
have
had
the
courage
to
address
me
in
that
tone
well
i
sincerely
congratulate
you
here
snip
here
my
bill
worry
it
worry
it
good
dog
worry
it
the
dog
growled
now
over
a
torn
document
beneath
the
table
miss
taft
you
might
see
that
a
goes
out
to
the
effect
that
i
gave
my
first
sitting
to
saracen
givington
this
morning
the
activities
of
saracen
givington
are
of
interest
to
the
world
and
rightly
so
you
better
come
round
to
the
other
side
for
the
right
foot
bootmaker
the
journey
is
simply
nothing
and
then
and
not
till
then
did
sir
john
pilgrim
turn
his
large
and
handsome
blond
face
in
the
direction
of
alderman
edward
henry
machin
pardon
my
curiosity
said
sir
john
but
who
are
you
my
name
is
machin
alderman
machin
said
edward
henry
i
sent
up
my
card
and
you
asked
me
to
come
in
ha
sir
john
exclaimed
seizing
an
egg
will
you
crack
an
egg
with
me
alderman
i
can
crack
an
egg
with
anybody
thanks
said
edward
henry
i
be
very
glad
to
and
he
advanced
towards
the
table
sir
john
hesitated
the
fact
was
that
though
he
dissembled
his
dismay
with
marked
histrionic
skill
he
was
unquestionably
overwhelmed
by
astonishment
in
the
course
of
years
he
had
airily
invited
hundreds
of
callers
to
crack
an
egg
with
him
the
joke
was
one
of
his
favourites
but
nobody
had
ever
ventured
to
accept
the
invitation
chung
he
said
weakly
lay
a
cover
for
the
alderman
edward
henry
sat
down
quite
close
to
sir
john
he
could
discern
all
the
details
of
sir
john
face
and
costume
the
tremendous
celebrity
was
wearing
a
somewhat
like
his
own
but
instead
of
the
coat
he
had
a
blue
with
crimson
facings
the
sleeves
ended
in
rather
long
wristbands
which
were
unfastened
the
opal
drooping
each
from
a
single
hole
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
edward
henry
intimately
understood
what
idiosyncratic
elegance
was
he
could
almost
feel
the
emanating
personality
of
sir
john
pilgrim
and
he
was
intimidated
by
it
he
was
intimidated
by
its
hardness
its
harshness
its
terrific
egotism
its
utterly
brazen
quality
sir
john
glance
was
the
most
purely
arrogant
that
edward
henry
had
ever
encountered
it
knew
no
reticence
and
edward
henry
thought
when
this
chap
dies
he
want
to
die
in
public
with
the
reporters
round
his
bed
and
a
private
secretary
taking
down
messages
this
is
rather
a
lark
said
sir
john
recovering
it
is
said
edward
henry
who
now
felicitously
perceived
that
a
lark
it
indeed
was
and
ought
to
be
treated
as
such
it
shall
be
a
lark
he
said
to
himself
sir
john
dictated
a
letter
to
miss
taft
and
before
the
letter
was
finished
the
grinning
chung
had
laid
a
place
for
edward
henry
and
snip
had
inspected
him
and
passed
him
for
one
of
the
right
sort
had
i
said
that
this
is
rather
a
lark
sir
john
inquired
the
letter
accomplished
i
forget
said
edward
henry
because
i
do
like
to
say
the
same
thing
twice
over
if
i
can
help
it
it
a
lark
though
is
it
undoubtedly
said
edward
henry
decapitating
an
egg
i
only
hope
that
i
not
interrupting
you
not
in
the
least
said
sir
john
breakfast
is
my
sole
free
time
in
another
half
hour
i
assure
you
i
shall
be
attending
to
three
or
four
things
at
once
he
leant
over
towards
edward
henry
but
between
you
and
me
alderman
quite
privately
if
it
is
a
rude
question
what
did
you
come
for
well
said
edward
henry
as
i
wrote
on
my
card
i
the
sole
proprietor
of
the
regent
theatre
but
there
is
no
regent
theatre
sir
john
interrupted
him
no
not
strictly
but
there
will
be
it
in
course
of
construction
we
up
to
the
first
floor
dear
me
a
suburban
theatre
no
doubt
do
you
mean
to
say
sir
john
cried
edward
henry
that
you
noticed
it
it
within
a
few
yards
of
piccadilly
circus
really
said
sir
john
you
see
my
theatre
is
in
lower
regent
street
and
i
never
go
to
piccadilly
circus
i
make
a
point
of
not
going
to
piccadilly
circus
miss
taft
how
long
is
it
since
i
went
to
piccadilly
circus
forgive
me
young
woman
i
was
forgetting
you
are
old
enough
to
remember
well
never
mind
details
and
what
is
there
remarkable
about
the
regent
theatre
alderman
i
intend
it
to
be
a
theatre
of
the
highest
class
sir
john
said
edward
henry
nothing
but
the
very
best
will
be
seen
on
its
boards
that
not
remarkable
alderman
we
all
like
that
have
you
noticed
it
then
secondly
said
edward
henry
i
am
the
sole
proprietor
i
have
no
financial
backers
no
mortgages
no
partners
i
have
made
no
contracts
with
anybody
that
said
sir
john
is
not
unremarkable
in
fact
many
persons
who
do
not
happen
to
possess
my
own
robust
capacity
for
belief
might
not
credit
your
statement
and
thirdly
said
edward
henry
every
member
of
the
audience
even
in
the
boxes
the
most
expensive
seats
will
have
a
full
view
of
the
whole
of
the
stage
or
in
the
alternative
at
a
full
view
of
a
lady
hat
alderman
said
sir
john
gravely
before
i
offer
you
another
egg
let
me
warn
you
against
carrying
remarkableness
too
far
you
may
be
regarded
as
eccentric
if
you
go
on
like
that
some
people
i
am
told
do
want
a
view
of
the
stage
then
they
had
better
not
come
to
my
theatre
said
edward
henry
all
which
commented
sir
john
gives
me
no
clue
whatever
to
the
reason
why
you
are
sitting
here
by
my
side
and
calmly
eating
my
eggs
and
toast
and
drinking
my
coffee
admittedly
edward
henry
was
nervous
admittedly
he
was
a
provincial
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
illustrious
personages
in
the
empire
nevertheless
he
controlled
his
nervousness
and
reflected
nobody
else
from
the
five
towns
would
or
could
have
done
what
i
am
doing
moreover
this
chap
is
a
mountebank
in
the
five
towns
they
would
to
him
but
they
would
laugh
at
him
they
would
mighty
soon
add
up
why
should
i
be
nervous
i
as
good
as
he
is
he
finished
with
the
thought
which
has
inspired
many
a
timid
man
with
new
courage
in
a
desperate
crisis
the
fellow
ca
eat
me
then
he
said
aloud
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
sir
john
one
one
are
you
the
head
of
the
theatrical
profession
or
is
sir
gerald
pompey
gerald
pompey
gerald
pompey
have
you
seen
the
papers
this
morning
sir
john
pilgrim
turned
pale
springing
up
he
seized
the
topmost
of
an
undisturbed
pile
of
daily
papers
and
feverishly
opened
it
bah
he
muttered
he
was
continually
thus
imitating
his
own
behaviour
on
the
stage
the
origin
of
his
renowned
breakfasts
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
had
once
played
the
part
of
a
who
juggled
at
breakfast
with
his
own
affairs
and
the
affairs
of
the
world
the
of
a
created
by
a
playwright
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
had
appealed
to
his
imagination
and
influenced
all
the
mornings
of
his
life
they
done
it
just
to
irritate
me
as
i
starting
off
on
my
tour
he
muttered
coursing
round
the
table
then
he
stopped
and
gazed
at
edward
henry
this
is
a
political
knighthood
said
he
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
stage
it
is
not
like
my
knighthood
is
it
certainly
not
edward
henry
agreed
but
you
know
how
people
will
talk
sir
john
people
will
be
going
about
this
very
morning
and
saying
that
sir
gerald
is
at
last
the
head
of
the
theatrical
profession
i
came
here
for
your
authoritative
opinion
i
know
unbiased
sir
john
resumed
his
chair
as
for
pompey
qualifications
as
a
head
he
murmured
i
know
nothing
of
them
i
fancy
his
heart
is
excellent
i
only
saw
him
twice
once
in
his
own
theatre
and
once
in
bond
street
i
should
be
inclined
to
say
that
on
the
stage
he
looks
more
like
a
gentleman
than
any
gentleman
ought
to
look
and
that
in
the
street
he
might
be
mistaken
for
an
actor
how
will
that
suit
you
it
a
clue
said
edward
henry
alderman
exclaimed
sir
john
i
believe
that
if
i
did
keep
a
firm
hand
on
myself
i
should
soon
begin
to
like
you
have
another
cup
of
coffee
chung
bootmaker
i
only
want
to
know
for
certain
who
is
the
head
said
edward
henry
because
i
mean
to
invite
the
head
of
the
theatrical
profession
to
lay
the
of
my
new
theatre
ah
when
do
you
start
on
your
world
tour
sir
john
i
leave
tilbury
with
my
entire
company
scenery
and
effects
on
the
morning
of
tuesday
week
by
the
i
shall
play
first
at
cairo
how
awkward
said
edward
henry
i
meant
to
ask
you
to
lay
the
stone
on
the
very
next
afternoon
wednesday
that
is
indeed
yes
sir
john
the
ceremony
will
be
a
very
original
affair
very
original
a
mused
sir
john
but
if
you
already
up
to
the
first
floor
how
can
you
be
laying
the
on
wednesday
week
i
did
say
i
said
edward
henry
corrected
him
an
entire
novelty
that
why
we
ca
be
ready
before
wednesday
week
and
you
want
to
advertise
your
house
by
getting
the
head
of
the
profession
to
assist
that
is
exactly
my
idea
well
said
sir
john
whatever
else
you
may
lack
alderman
you
are
not
lacking
in
nerve
if
you
expect
to
succeed
in
edward
henry
smiled
i
have
already
heard
in
a
roundabout
way
he
replied
that
sir
gerald
pompey
would
not
be
unwilling
to
officiate
my
only
difficulty
is
that
i
a
truthful
man
by
nature
whoever
officiates
i
shall
of
course
have
to
have
him
labelled
in
my
own
interests
as
the
head
of
the
theatrical
profession
and
i
do
want
to
say
anything
that
is
true
there
was
a
pause
now
sir
john
could
you
stay
a
day
or
two
longer
in
london
and
join
the
ship
at
marseilles
instead
of
going
on
board
at
tilbury
but
i
have
made
all
my
arrangements
the
whole
world
knows
that
i
am
going
on
board
at
tilbury
just
then
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
announced
carlo
trent
sir
john
pilgrim
rushed
like
a
locomotive
to
the
threshold
and
seized
both
carlo
trent
hands
with
such
a
violence
of
welcome
that
carlo
trent
eyeglass
fell
out
of
his
eye
and
the
purple
ribbon
dangled
to
his
waist
come
in
come
in
said
sir
john
and
begin
to
read
at
once
been
looking
out
of
the
window
for
you
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
alderman
this
is
carlo
trent
the
dramatic
poet
trent
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
geniuses
in
london
ah
you
know
each
other
it
not
surprising
no
do
stop
to
shake
hands
sit
down
here
trent
sit
down
on
this
chair
here
snip
take
his
hat
worry
it
worry
it
now
trent
do
read
to
it
might
make
you
nervous
and
hurried
read
to
miss
taft
and
chung
and
to
givington
over
there
imagine
that
they
are
the
great
and
enlightened
public
you
have
imagination
have
you
being
a
poet
sir
john
had
accomplished
the
change
of
mood
with
the
rapidity
of
a
transformation
scene
in
which
form
of
art
by
the
way
he
was
a
great
adept
carlo
trent
somewhat
breathless
took
a
manuscript
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
announced
the
orient
pearl
oh
breathed
edward
henry
for
some
thirty
minutes
edward
henry
listened
to
hexameters
the
first
he
had
ever
heard
the
effect
of
them
on
his
moral
organism
was
worse
than
he
had
expected
he
glanced
about
at
the
other
auditors
givington
had
opened
a
box
of
tubes
and
was
spreading
colours
on
his
palette
the
chinaman
eyes
were
closed
while
his
face
still
grinned
snip
was
asleep
on
the
parquet
miss
taft
bit
the
end
of
a
pencil
with
her
agreeable
teeth
sir
john
pilgrim
lay
at
full
length
on
a
sofa
occasionally
lifting
his
legs
edward
henry
despaired
of
help
in
his
great
need
but
just
as
his
desperation
was
becoming
too
acute
to
be
borne
carlo
trent
ejaculated
the
word
curtain
it
was
the
first
word
that
edward
henry
had
clearly
understood
that
the
first
act
said
carlo

wiping
his
face
snip
awakened
edward
henry
rose
and
in
the
hush
tiptoed
round
to
the
sofa
sir

whispered

in
the

the
tone
of
an
old
friend

alderman

my
coat
trent
an
hour
later
edward
henry
met
marrier
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
well
sir
said
marrier
you
are
the
greatest
man
that
ever
lived
why
marrier
showed
him
the
news
of
a
penny
evening
paper
which
read
sir
john
pilgrim
has
abandoned
his
ceremonious
departure
from
tilbury
in
order

advertaysing
said
marrier
pilgrim
will
do
all
the
advertaysing
for
you
iii
edward
henry
and
marrier
worked
together
admirably
that
afternoon
on
the
arrangements
for
the
and
such
was
the
interaction
of
their
separate
enthusiasms
it
soon
became
apparent
that
all
london
in
the
only
right
sense
of
the
word
all
must
and
would
be
at
the
ceremony
characteristically
marrier
happened
to
have
a
list
or
catalogue
of
all
london
in
his
pocket
and
edward
henry
appreciated
him
more
than
ever
but
towards
four
marrier
annoyed
and
even
somewhat
alarmed
edward
henry
by
a
mysterious
change
of
mien
his
assured
optimism
slipped
away
from
him
he
grew
uneasy
darkly
preoccupied
and
inefficient
at
last
when
the
clock
in
the
room
struck
four
and
edward
henry
failed
to
hear
it
marrier
said
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
excuse
me
now
why
i
told
you
i
had
an
appointment
for
tea
at
four
did
you
what
is
it
edward
henry
demanded
with
an
instinctive
assumption
that
souls
as
well
as
brains
can
be
bought
for
such
sums
as
three
pounds
a
week
i
have
a
lady
coming
to
tea
here
that
is
downstairs
in
this
hotel
yes
who
is
it
edward
henry
pursued
lightly
for
though
he
appreciated
harrier
he
also
despised
him
however
he
found
the
grace
to
add
may
one
ask
it
miss
elsie
april
do
you
mean
to
say
marrier
complained
edward
henry
that
known
miss
elsie
april
all
these
months
and
never
told
me
there
are
two
i
suppose
it
the
cousin
or
something
of
rose
euclid
marrier
nodded
the
fact
is
he
said
she
and
i
are
joint
honorary
organizing
secretaries
for
the
annual
conference
of
the
azure
society
you
know
it
leads
the
new
thought
movement
in
england
you
never
told
me
that
either
did
i
sir
i
did
think
it
would
interest
you
besides
both
miss
april
and
i
are
comparatively
new
members
oh
said
edward
henry
with
all
the
canny
provincial
conviction
of
his
own
superior
shrewdness
and
he
repeated
so
as
to
intensify
this
conviction
and
impress
it
on
others
oh
in
the
undergrowth
of
his
mind
was
the
thought
how
dare
this
man
whose
brains
belong
to
me
be
the
organizing
secretary
of
something
that
i
do
know
anything
about
and
do
want
to
know
anything
about
yes
said
marrier
modestly
i
say
edward
henry
inquired
warmly
with
an
impulsive
gesture
who
is
she
who
is
she
repeated
marrier
blankly
yes
what
does
she
do
does
do
anything
said
marrier
very
good
amateur
actress
goes
about
a
great
deal
her
mother
was
on
the
stage
married
a
wealthy
wholesale
who
did
miss
april
edward
henry
had
a
twinge
no
her
mother
both
parents
dead
and
miss
april
has
an
income
a
considerable
income
what
do
you
call
considerable
five
or
six
thousand
a
year
the
deuce
murmured
edward
henry
may
have
lost
a
bit
of
it
of
course
marrier
hedged
but
not
much
not
much
well
said
edward
henry
smiling
what
about
tea
am
i
to
have
tea
all
by
myself
will
you
come
down
and
meet
her
marrier
expression
approached
the
wistful
well
said
edward
henry
it
an
idea
is
it
why
should
i
be
the
only
person
in
london
who
does
know
miss
elsie
april
it
was
ten
minutes
past
four
when
they
descended
into
the
electric
publicity
of
the
grand
babylon
amid
the
music
and
the
rattle
of
crockery
and
the
gliding
waiters
and
the
large
nodding
hats
that
gathered
more
and
more
thickly
round
the
tables
there
was
no
sign
of
elsie
april
she
may
have
been
and
gone
away
again
said
edward
henry
apprehensive
oh
no
she
would
go
away
marrier
was
positive
in
the
tone
of
a
man
with
an
income
of
two
hundred
pounds
a
week
he
ordered
a
table
to
be
prepared
for
three
at
ten
minutes
to
five
he
said
i
hope
she
been
and
gone
away
again
edward
henry
began
to
be
gloomy
and
resentful
the
crowded
and
factitious
gaiety
of
the
place
actually
annoyed
him
if
elsie
april
had
been
and
gone
away
again
he
objected
to
such
silly
feminine
conduct
if
she
was
merely
late
he
equally
objected
to
such
unconscionable
inexactitude
he
blamed
marrier
he
considered
that
he
had
the
right
to
blame
marrier
because
he
paid
him
three
pounds
a
week
and
he
very
badly
wanted
his
tea
then
their
four
eyes
which
for
forty
minutes
had
scarcely
left
the
entrance
staircase
were
rewarded
she
came
in
furs
gleaming
white
kid
gloves
gold
chains
a
gold
bag
and
a
black
velvet
hat
i
not
late
am
i
she
said
after
the
introduction
no
they
both
replied
and
they
both
meant
it
for
she
was
like
fine
weather
the
forty
minutes
of
waiting
were
forgotten
expunged
from
the
records
of
time
just
as
the
memory
of
a
month
of
rain
is
obliterated
by
one
splendid
sunny
day
iv
edward
henry
enjoyed
the
tea
which
was
bad
to
an
extraordinary
degree
he
became
uplifted
in
the
presence
of
miss
elsie
april
whereas
marrier
strangely
drooped
to
still
deeper
depths
of
unaccustomed
inert
melancholy
edward
henry
decided
that
she
was
every
bit
as
piquant
challenging
and
delectable
as
he
had
imagined
her
to
be
on
the
day
when
he
ate
an
artichoke
at
the
next
table
to
hers
at
wilkins
she
coincided
exactly
with
his
remembrance
of
her
except
that
she
was
now
slightly
more
plump
her
contours
were
effulgent
there
was
no
other
word
beautiful
she
was
not
for
she
had
a
nose
but
what
charm
she
radiated
every
movement
and
tone
enchanted
edward
henry
he
was
enchanted
not
at
intervals
by
a
chance
gesture
but
all
the
time
when
she
was
serious
when
she
smiled
when
she
fingered
her
when
she
pushed
her
furs
back
over
her
shoulders
when
she
spoke
of
the
weather
when
she
spoke
of
the
social
crisis
and
when
she
made
fun
with
a
certain
brief
absence
of
restraint
rather
in
her
artichoke
manner
of
making
fun
he
thought
and
believed
this
is
the
finest
woman
i
ever
saw
he
clearly
perceived
the
inferiority
of
other
women
whom
nevertheless
he
admired
and
liked
such
as
the
countess
of
chell
and
lady
woldo
it
was
not
her
brains
nor
her
beauty
nor
her
stylishness
that
affected
him
no
it
was
something
mysterious
and
dizzying
that
resided
in
every
particle
of
her
individuality
he
thought
i
often
and
often
wanted
to
see
her
again
and
now
i
having
tea
with
her
and
he
was
happy
have
you
got
that
list
mr
harrier
she
asked
in
her
low
and
thrilling
voice
so
saying
she
raised
her
eyebrows
in
expectation
a
delicious
effect
especially
behind
her
white
veil
marrier
produced
a
document
but
that
list
said
edward
henry
your
list
i
better
tell
you
marrier
essayed
a
rapid
explanation
machin
wanted
a
list
of
the
raight
sort
of
people
to
ask
to
the
of
his
theatah
so
i
used
this
as
a
basis
elsie
april
smiled
again
very
good
she
approved
what
your
list
marrier
asked
edward
henry
it
was
elsie
who
replied
people
to
be
invited
to
the
dramatic
soirée
of
the
azure
society
we
give
six
a
year
no
title
is
announced
nobody
except
a
committee
of
three
knows
even
the
name
of
the
author
of
the
play
that
is
to
be
performed
everything
is
kept
a
secret
even
the
author
does
know
that
his
play
has
been
chosen
do
you
think
it
a
delightful
idea
an
offspring
of
the
new
thought
he
agreed
that
it
was
a
delightful
idea
shall
i
be
invited
he
asked
she
answered
gravely
i
do
know
are
you
going
to
play
in
it
she
paused
yes
then
you
must
let
me
come
talking
of
plays
he
stopped
he
was
on
the
edge
of
facetiously
relating
the
episode
of
the
orient
pearl
at
sir
john
pilgrim
but
he
withdrew
in
time
suppose
that
the
orient
pearl
was
the
piece
to
be
performed
by
the
azure
society
it
might
well
be
it
was
in
his
opinion
just
the
sort
of
play
that
that
sort
of
society
would
choose
nevertheless
he
was
as
anxious
as
ever
to
see
elsie
april
act
he
really
thought
that
she
could
and
would
transfigure
any
play
even
his
profound
scorn
of
new
thought
a
subject
of
which
he
was
entirely
ignorant
began
to
be
modified
and
by
nothing
but
the
enchantment
of
the
tone
in
which
elsie
april
murmured
the
words
azure
society
how
soon
is
the
performance
he
demanded
wednesday
week
said
she
that
the
very
day
of
my
he
said
however
it
does
matter
my
little
affair
will
be
in
the
afternoon
but
it
ca
be
said
she
solemnly
it
would
interfere
with
us
and
we
should
interfere
with
it
our
annual
conference
takes
place
in
the
afternoon
all
london
will
be
there
said
marrier
rather
shamefaced
that
just
it
machin
it
positively
never
occurred
to
me
that
the
azure
conference
is
to
be
on
that
very
day
i
never
thought
of
it
until
nearly
four
and
then
i
scarcely
knew
how
to
explain
it
to
you
i
really
do
know
how
it
escaped
me
marrier
trouble
was
now
out
and
he
had
declined
in
edward
henry
esteem
marrier
was
afraid
of
him
marrier
list
of
personages
was
no
longer
a
miracle
of
foresight
it
was
a
mere
coincidence
he
doubted
if
marrier
was
worth
even
his
three
pounds
a
week
edward
henry
began
to
feel
ruthless
napoleonic
he
was
capable
of
brushing
away
the
whole
azure
society
and
new
thought
movement
into
limbo
you
must
please
alter
your
date
said
elsie
april
and
she
put
her
right
elbow
on
the
table
and
leaned
her
chin
on
it
and
thus
somehow
established
a
domestic
intimacy
for
the
three
amid
all
the
blare
and
notoriety
of
the
vast
oh
but
i
ca
he
said
easily
familiarly
it
was
her
occasional
artichoke
manner
that
had
justified
him
in
assuming
this
tone
i
ca
he
repeated
i
told
sir
john
i
ca
possibly
be
ready
any
earlier
and
on
the
day
after
he
almost
certainly
be
on
his
way
to
marseilles
besides
i
do
to
alter
my
date
my
date
is
in
the
papers
by
this
time
you
already
done
quite
enough
harm
to
the
movement
as
it
is
said
elsie
april
stoutly
but
ravishingly
me
harm
to
the
movement
have
you
stopped
the
building
of
our
church
oh
so
you
know
mr
wrissell
very
well
indeed
anybody
else
would
have
done
the
same
in
my
place
edward
henry
defended
himself
your
cousin
miss
euclid
would
have
done
it
and
marrier
here
was
in
the
affair
with
her
ah
exclaimed
elsie
april
but
we
did
belong
to
the
movement
then
we
did
know
come
now
machin
sir
john
pilgrim
will
of
course
be
a
great
draw
but
even
if
you
got
him
and
manage
to
stick
to
him
we
should
beat
you
you
never
get
the
audience
you
want
if
you
do
change
from
wednesday
week
after
all
the
number
of
people
who
count
in
london
is
very
small
and
we
got
nearly
all
of
them
you
no
idea
i
wo
change
from
wednesday
week
said
edward
henry
this
defiance
of
her
put
him
into
an
extremely
agitated
felicity
now
my
dear
machin
he
was
acutely
aware
of
the
charm
she
was
exerting
and
yet
he
discovered
that
he
could
easily
withstand
it
now
my
dear
miss
april
please
do
try
to
take
advantage
of
your
beauty
she
sat
up
she
was
apparently
measuring
herself
and
him
then
you
wo
change
the
day
truly
her
urbanity
was
in
no
wise
impaired
i
wo
he
laughed
lightly
i
daresay
you
are
used
to
people
like
me
miss
april
she
might
get
the
better
of
seven
sachs
but
not
of
him
edward
henry
machin
from
the
five
towns
marrier
said
he
suddenly
with
a
bluff
humorous
downrightness
you
know
you
in
a
very
awkward
position
here
and
you
know
got
to
see
alloyd
for
me
before
six
be
off
with
you
i
will
be
responsible
for
miss
april
i
show
these
londoners
he
said
to
himself
it
simple
enough
when
you
once
get
into
it
and
he
did
in
fact
succeed
in
dismissing
marrier
after
the
latter
had
talked
azure
business
with
miss
april
for
a
couple
of
minutes
i
must
go
too
said
elsie
imperturbable
impenetrable
one
moment
he
entreated
and
masterfully
signalled
marrier
to
depart
after
all
he
was
paying
the
fellow
three
pounds
a
week
she
watched
marrier
thread
his
way
out
already
she
had
put
on
her
gloves
i
must
go
she
repeated
her
rich
red
lips
then
closed
definitely
have
you
a
motor
here
edward
henry
asked
no
then
if
i
may
i
see
you
home
you
may
she
said
gazing
full
at
him
whereby
he
was
somewhat
startled
and
put
out
of
countenance
v
are
we
friends
he
asked
roguishly
i
hope
so
she
said
with
no
diminution
of
her
inscrutability
they
were
in
a
rolling
along
the
embankment
towards
the
buckingham
palace
hotel
where
she
said
she
lived
he
was
happy
why
am
i
happy
he
thought
is
there
in
her
that
makes
me
happy
he
did
not
know
but
he
knew
that
he
had
never
been
in
a
or
anywhere
else
with
any
woman
half
so
elegant
her
elegance
flattered
him
enormously
here
he
was
a
provincial
man
of
business
ruffling
it
with
the
best
of
them
and
she
was
young
in
her
worldly
maturity
was
she
she
could
not
be
more
she
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
faintly
smiling
yes
he
was
fully
aware
that
he
was
a
married
man
he
had
a
distinct
vision
of
the
angelic
nellie
of
the
three
children
and
of
his
mother
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
own
case
differed
in
some
very
subtle
and
yet
effective
manner
from
the
similar
case
of
any
other
married
man
and
he
lived
unharassed
by
apprehensions
in
the
lively
joy
of
the
moment
but
she
said
i
hope
you
wo
come
to
see
me
act
why
because
i
should
prefer
you
not
to
you
would
not
be
sympathetic
to
me
oh
yes
i
should
i
should
feel
it
so
and
then
with
a
swift
disarrangement
of
all
the
folds
of
her
skirt
she
turned
and
faced
him
machin
do
you
know
why
i
let
you
come
with
me
because
you
a
woman
he
said
she
grew
even
graver
shaking
her
head
no
i
simply
wanted
to
tell
you
that
you
ruined
rose
my
cousin
miss
euclid
me
ruined
miss
euclid
yes
you
robbed
her
of
her
theatre
her
one
chance
he
blushed
excuse
me
he
said
i
did
no
such
thing
i
simply
bought
her
option
from
her
she
was
absolutely
free
to
keep
the
option
or
let
it
go
the
fact
remains
said
elsie
april
with
humid
eyes
the
fact
remains
that
she
set
her
heart
on
having
that
theatre
and
you
failed
her
at
the
last
instant
and
she
has
nothing
and
you
got
the
theatre
entirely
in
your
own
hands
i
not
so
silly
as
to
suppose
that
you
ca
defend
yourself
legally
but
let
me
tell
you
that
rose
went
to
the
united
states
and
she
playing
to
empty
houses
there
empty
houses
whereas
she
might
have
been
here
in
london
interested
in
her
theatre
and
preparing
for
a
successful
season
i
no
idea
of
this
breathed
edward
henry
he
was
dashed
awfully
sorry
yes
no
doubt
but
there
it
is
silence
fell
he
knew
not
what
to
say
he
felt
himself
in
one
way
innocent
but
he
felt
himself
in
another
way
blackly
guilty
his
remorse
for
the
which
he
had
practised
on
rose
euclid
burst
forth
again
after
a
long
period
of
quiescence
simulating
death
and
acutely
troubled
him
no
he
was
not
guilty
he
insisted
in
his
heart
that
he
was
not
guilty
and
yet
and
yet
no
ever
travelled
so
quickly
as
that
before
he
could
gather
together
his
forces
it
had
arrived
beneath
the
awning
of
the
buckingham
palace
hotel
his
last
words
to
her
were
now
i
sha
change
the
day
of
my
but
do
worry
about
your
conference
you
know
it
be
perfectly
all
right
he
spoke
archly
with
a
brave
attempt
at
cajolery
but
in
the
recesses
of
his
soul
he
was
not
sure
that
she
had
not
defeated
him
in
this
their
first
encounter
however
seven
sachs
might
talk
as
he
chose
she
was
not
such
a
persuasive
creature
as
all
that
she
had
scarcely
even
tried
to
be
persuasive
at
about
a
six
when
he
saw
his
underling
again
he
said
to
marrier
marrier
i
got
a
great
idea
we
have
that
at
night
after
the
theatres
say
eleven
torchlight
fireworks
from
the
cranes
it
tickle
old
pilgrim
to
death
i
shall
have
a
marquee
with
matchboarding
sides
fixed
up
inside
and
heat
it
with
a
few
of
those
smokeless
stoves
we
can
easily
lay
on
electricity
it
will
be
absolutely
the
most
sensational
that
ever
was
it
be
in
all
the
papers
all
over
the
blessed
world
think
of
it
torches
fireworks
from
the
cranes
but
i
wo
change
the
day
neither
for
miss
april
nor
anybody
else
marrier
dissolved
in
laudations
well
edward
henry
agreed
with
false
diffidence
it
knock
spots
off
some
of
in
this
town
he
felt
that
he
had
snatched
victory
out
of
defeat
but
the
next
moment
he
was
capable
of
feeling
that
elsie
april
had
defeated
him
even
in
his
victory
anyhow
she
was
a
most
disconcerting
and
creature
there
was
one
source
of
unsullied
gratification
he
had
shaved
off
his
beard
vi
come
up
here
sir
john
edward
henry
called
you
see
better
and
you
be
out
of
the
crowd
and
i
show
you
something
he
stood
in
a
fur
coat
at
the
top
of
a
short
flight
of
steps
between
two
unplastered
walls
a
staircase
which
ultimately
was
to
form
part
of
an
emergency
exit
from
the
of
the
regent
theatre
sir
john
pilgrim
also
in
a
fur
coat
stood
near
the
bottom
of
the
steps
with
the
glare
of
a
wells
light
full
on
him
and
throwing
his
shadow
almost
up
to
edward
henry
feet
around
edward
henry
could
descry
the
vast
mysterious
forms
of
the
skeleton
black
in
places
but
in
other
places
lit
up
by
bright
rays
from
the
gaiety
below
and
showing
glimpses
of
that
gaiety
in
the
occasional
revelation
of
a
woman
cloak
through
slits
in
the
construction
high
overhead
two
gigantic
cranes
interlaced
their
arms
and
even
higher
than
the
cranes
shone
the
stars
of
the
clear
spring
night
the
hour
was
nearly
twelve
the
ceremony
was
concluded
and
successfully
concluded
all
london
had
indeed
been
present
half
the
aristocracy
of
england
and
far
more
than
half
the
aristocracy
of
the
london
stage
the
entire
preciosity
of
the
metropolis
journalists
with
influence
enough
to
plunge
the
whole
of
europe
into
war
in
one
short
hour
edward
henry
right
hand
peeping
out
from
that
superb
fur
coat
which
he
had
had
the
wit
to
buy
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
scores
upon
scores
of
the
most
celebrated
right
hands
in
britain
he
had
the
sensation
that
in
future
whenever
he
walked
about
the
best
streets
of
the
west
end
he
would
be
continually
compelled
to
stop
and
chat
with
august
and
renowned
acquaintances
and
that
he
would
always
be
taking
off
his
hat
to
fine
ladies
who
flashed
by
nodding
from
powerful
indeed
edward
henry
was
surprised
at
the
number
of
famous
people
who
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
but
attend
advertising
rituals
at
midnight
or
thereabouts
sir
john
pilgrim
had
as
marrier
predicted
attended
to
the
advertisements
but
edward
henry
had
helped
and
on
the
day
itself
the
evening
newspapers
had
taken
the
bit
between
their
teeth
and
run
off
with
the
affair
at
a
great
pace
the
affair
was
on
all
the
hours
before
it
actually
happened
edward
henry
had
been
interviewed
several
times
and
had
rather
enjoyed
that
gradually
he
had
perceived
that
his
novel
idea
for
a
had
caught
the
facile
imagination
of
the
london
populace
for
that
night
at
least
he
was
famous
as
famous
as
anybody
sir
john
had
made
a
wondrous
picturesque
figure
of
himself
as
in
a
raised
corner
of
the
crowded
and
beflagged
marquee
he
had
flourished
a
trowel
and
talked
about
the
great
and
enlightened
public
and
about
the
highest
function
of
the
drama
and
about
the
duty
of
the
artist
to
elevate
and
about
the
solemn
responsibility
of
theatrical
managers
and
about
the
absence
of
petty
jealousies
in
the
world
of
the
stage
everybody
had
vociferously
applauded
while
reporters
turned
rapidly
the
pages
of
their
ass
edward
henry
had
said
to
himself
with
much
force
and
sincerity
meaning
sir
john
but
he
too
had
vociferously
applauded
for
he
was
from
the
five
towns
and
in
the
five
towns
people
are
like
that
then
sir
john
had
declared
the
well
and
truly
laid
it
was
on
the
corner
which
the
electric
sign
of
the
future
was
destined
to
occupy
and
after
being
thanked
had
wandered
off
shaking
hands
here
and
there
absently
to
arrive
at
length
in
the
office
of
the
where
edward
henry
had
arranged
suitably
to
refresh
the
and
a
few
choice
friends
of
both
sexes
he
had
hoped
that
elsie
april
would
somehow
reach
that
little
office
but
elsie
april
was
absent
indisposed
her
absence
made
the
one
blemish
on
the
affair
perfection
elsie
april
it
appeared
had
been
struck
down
by
a
cold
which
had
entirely
deprived
her
of
her
voice
so
that
the
performance
of
the
azure
society
dramatic
club
so
eagerly
anticipated
by
all
london
had
had
to
be
postponed
edward
henry
bore
the
misfortune
of
the
azure
society
with
stoicism
but
he
had
been
extremely
disappointed
by
the
invisibility
of
elsie
april
at
his
his
eyes
had
wanted
her
sir
john
awaking
apparently
out
of
a
dream
when
edward
henry
had
summoned
him
twice
climbed
the
uneven
staircase
and
joined
his
host
and
youngest
rival
on
the
insecure
planks
and
gangways
that
covered
the
first
floor
of
the
regent
theatre
come
higher
said
edward
henry
mounting
upward
to
the
beginnings
of
the
second
story
above
which
hung
suspended
from
the
larger
crane
the
great
cage
that
was
employed
to
carry
brick
and
stone
from
the
ground
the
two
fur
coats
almost
mingled
well
young
man
said
sir
john
pilgrim
your
troubles
will
soon
be
beginning
now
edward
henry
hated
to
be
addressed
as
young
man
especially
in
the
patronizing
tone
which
sir
john
used
moreover
he
had
a
suspicion
that
in
sir
john
mind
was
the
illusion
that
sir
john
alone
was
responsible
for
the
creation
of
the
regent
theatre
that
without
sir
john
aid
as
a
it
could
never
have
existed
you
mean
my
troubles
as
a
manager
said
edward
henry
grimly
in
twelve
months
from
now
before
i
come
back
from
my
tour
you
be
ready
to
get
rid
of
this
thing
on
any
terms
you
will
be
wishing
that
you
had
imitated
my
example
and
kept
out
of
piccadilly
circus
piccadilly
circus
is
sinister
my
alderman
sinister
come
up
into
the
cage
sir
john
said
edward
henry
you
get
a
still
better
view
rather
fine
is
it
even
from
here
he
climbed
up
into
the
cage
and
helped
sir
john
to
climb
and
standing
there
in
the
immediate
silence
sir
john
murmured
with
emotion
we
are
alone
with
london
edward
henry
thought
cuckoo
they
heard
footsteps
resounding
on
loose
planks
in
a
distant
corner
who
there
edward
henry
called
only
me
replied
a
voice
nobody
takes
any
notice
of
me
who
is
it
muttered
sir
john
alloyd
the
architect
edward
henry
answered
and
then
calling
loud
come
up
here
alloyd
the
muffled
and
coated
figure
approached
hesitated
and
then
joined
the
other
two
in
the
cage
let
me
introduce
alloyd
the
architect
sir
john
pilgrim
said
edward
henry
ah
said
sir
john
bending
towards
alloyd
are
you
the
genius
who
draws
those
amusing
little
lines
and
scrawls
on
transparent
paper
alloyd
tell
me
are
they
really
necessary
for
a
building
or
do
you
only
do
them
for
your
own
fun
quite
between
ourselves
you
know
often
wondered
said
alloyd
with
a
pale
smile
of
course
everyone
looks
on
the
architect
as
a
joke
the
pause
was
somewhat
difficult
you
promised
us
rockets
machin
said
sir
john
my
mind
yearns
for
rockets
right
you
are
edward
henry
complied
close
by
but
somewhat
above
them
was
the
manned
by
an
engineer
whom
edward
henry
was
paying
for
overtime
a
signal
was
given
and
the
cage
containing
the
proprietor
and
the
architect
of
the
theatre
and
sir
john
pilgrim
bounded
most
startlingly
up
into
the
air
simultaneously
it
began
to
revolve
rapidly
on
its
cable
as
such
cages
will
whether
filled
with
bricks
or
with
celebrities
oh
ejaculated
sir
john
clinging
hard
to
the
side
of
the
cage
oh
ejaculated
alloyd
also
clinging
hard
i
want
you
to
see
london
said
edward
henry
who
had
been
through
the
experience
before
the
wind
blew
cold
above
the
chimneys
the
cage
came
to
a
standstill
exactly
at
the
peak
of
the
other
crane
london
lay
beneath
the
trio
the
curves
of
regent
street
and
of
shaftesbury
avenue
the
right
lines
of
piccadilly
lower
regent
street
and
coventry
street
were
displayed
at
their
feet
as
on
an
illuminated
map
over
which
crawled
mannikins
and
at
their
feet
a
long
procession
of
automobiles
were
sliding
off
one
after
another
with
the
guests
of
the
evening
the
metropolis
stretched
away
lifting
to
the
north
and
sinking
to
the
south
into
the
jewelled
river
on
whose
curved
bank
rose
messages
of
light
concerning
whisky
tea
and
beer
the
peaceful
nocturnal
roar
of
the
city
dwindling
every
moment
now
reached
them
like
an
emanation
from
another
world
you
asked
for
a
rocket
sir
john
said
edward
henry
you
shall
have
it
he
had
taken
a
box
of
fusees
from
his
pocket
he
struck
one
and
his
companions
in
the
swaying
cage
now
saw
that
a
tremendous
rocket
was
hung
to
the
peak
of
the
other
crane
he
lighted
the
fuse
an
instant
of
deathly
suspense
and
then
with
a
terrific
and
a
shattering
bang
and
splutter
the
rocket
shot
towards
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
there
burst
into
a
vast
dome
of
red
blossoms
which
irradiating
a
square
mile
of
roofs
descended
slowly
and
softly
on
the
west
end
like
a
benediction
you
always
want
crimson
do
you
sir
john
said
edward
henry
and
the
easy
cheeriness
of
his
voice
gradually
tranquillized
the
alarm
natural
to
two
very
earthly
men
who
for
the
first
time
found
themselves
suspended
insecurely
over
a
gulf
i
have
seen
nothing
so
impressive
since
the
russian
ballet
murmured
alloyd
recovering
you
ought
to
go
to
siberia
alloyd
said
edward
henry
sir
john
pilgrim
pretending
now
to
be
extremely
brave
suddenly
turned
on
edward
henry
and
in
a
convulsive
grasp
seized
his
hand
my
friend
he
said
hoarsely
a
thought
has
just
occurred
to
me
you
and
i
are
the
two
most
remarkable
men
in
london
he
glanced
up
as
the
cage
trembled
how
thin
that
steel
rope
seems
the
cage
slowly
descended
with
many
twists
edward
henry
said
not
a
word
he
was
too
deeply
moved
by
his
own
triumph
to
be
able
to
speak
who
else
but
me
he
reflected
exultant
could
have
managed
this
affair
as
i
managed
it
did
anyone
else
ever
take
sir
john
pilgrim
up
into
the
sky
like
a
load
of
bricks
and
frighten
his
life
out
of
him
as
the
cage
approached
the
platforms
of
the
first
story
he
saw
two
people
waiting
there
one
he
recognized
as
the
faithful
harmless
marrier
the
other
was
a
woman
someone
here
wants
you
urgently
mr
machin
cried
marrier
by
jove
exclaimed
alloyd
under
his
breath
what
a
beautiful
figure
no
girl
as
attractive
as
that
ever
wanted
urgently
some
folks
do
have
luck
the
woman
had
moved
a
little
away
when
the
cage
landed
edward
henry
followed
her
along
the
planking
it
was
elsie
april
i
thought
you
were
ill
in
bed
he
breathed
astounded
her
answering
voice
reached
him
scarcely
audible
i
only
hoarse
my
cousin
rose
has
arrived
in
secret
at
tilbury
by
the
the
he
muttered
staggering
coincidence
mystic
heralding
of
misfortune
i
was
sent
for
the
pale
ghost
of
a
delicate
voice
continued
broken
ruined
no
courage
left
awful
fiasco
in
chicago
she
hiding
now
at
a
little
hotel
in
soho
she
absolutely
declined
to
come
to
my
hotel
i
done
what
i
could
for
the
moment
as
i
was
driving
by
here
just
now
i
saw
the
rocket
and
i
thought
of
you
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
it
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
tell
you
she
held
her
muff
to
her
mouth
she
seemed
to
be
trembling
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
excuse
me
sir
said
a
strong
rough
voice
are
you
the
gent
that
fired
off
the
rocket
it
against
the
law
to
do
that
kind
o
thing
here
and
you
ought
to
know
it
i
shall
have
to
trouble
you
it
was
a
policeman
of
the
c
division
sir
john
was
disappearing
with
his
stealthy
and
conspiratorial
air
down
the
staircase
chapter
viii
dealing
with
elsie
i
the
headquarters
of
the
azure
society
were
situate
in
marloes
road
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
happened
so
though
certain
famous
people
inhabit
marloes
road
no
street
could
well
be
less
fashionable
than
this
thoroughfare
which
is
very
arid
and
very
long
and
a
very
long
way
off
the
centre
of
the
universe
the
azure
society
you
know
edward
henry
added
when
he
had
given
the
exact
address
to
the
chauffeur
of
the
taxi
the
chauffeur
however
did
not
know
and
did
not
seem
to
be
ashamed
of
his
ignorance
his
attitude
indicated
that
he
despised
marloes
road
and
was
not
particularly
anxious
for
his
vehicle
to
be
seen
therein
especially
on
a
wet
night
but
that
nevertheless
he
would
endeavour
to
reach
it
when
he
did
reach
it
and
observed
the
large
concourse
of
shining
automobiles
that
struggled
together
in
the
rain
in
front
of
the
illuminated
number
named
by
edward
henry
the
chauffeur
admitted
to
himself
that
for
once
he
had
been
mistaken
and
his
manner
of
receiving
money
from
edward
henry
was
generously
respectful
originally
the
headquarters
of
the
azure
society
had
been
a
seminary
and
schoolmistress
house
the
thoroughness
with
which
the
buildings
had
been
transformed
showed
that
money
was
not
among
the
things
which
the
society
had
to
search
for
it
had
rich
resources
and
it
had
also
high
social
standing
and
the
deferential
commissionaires
at
the
doors
and
the
appealing
girls
who
gave
away
programmes
in
the
were
a
proof
that
the
society
while
doubtless
anxious
about
such
subjects
as
the
persistence
of
individuality
after
death
had
no
desire
to
reconstitute
the
community
on
a
democratic
basis
it
was
above
such
transient
trifles
of
reform
and
its
high
endeavours
were
confined
to
questions
of
immortality
of
the
infinite
of
sex
and
of
art
which
questions
it
discussed
in
fine
raiment
and
with
all
the
punctilio
of
courtly
politeness
edward
henry
was
late
in
common
with
some
two
hundred
other
people
of
whom
the
majority
were
elegant
women
wearing
paris
or
gowns
with
a
difference
as
on
the
current
of
the
variegated
throng
he
drifted
through
corridors
into
the
bijou
theatre
of
the
society
he
could
not
help
feeling
proud
of
his
own
presence
there
and
yet
at
the
same
time
he
was
scorning
in
his
five
towns
way
the
preciosity
and
the
simperings
of
those
his
seated
in
the
auditorium
at
the
end
of
a
row
he
was
aware
of
an
even
keener
satisfaction
as
people
bowed
and
smiled
to
him
for
the
theatre
was
so
tiny
and
the
reunion
so
choice
that
it
was
obviously
an
honour
and
a
distinction
to
have
been
invited
to
such
an
exclusive
affair
to
the
evening
first
fixed
for
the
dramatic
soirée
of
the
azure
society
he
had
received
no
invitation
but
shortly
after
the
postponement
due
to
elsie
april
indisposition
an
envelope
addressed
by
marrier
himself
and
containing
the
sacred
card
had
arrived
for
him
in
bursley
his
instinct
had
been
to
ignore
it
and
for
two
days
he
had
ignored
it
and
then
he
noticed
in
one
corner
the
initials
strange
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
immediately
that
stood
or
might
stand
for
elsie
april
reflection
brings
wisdom
and
knowledge
in
the
end
he
was
absolutely
convinced
that
stood
for
elsie
april
and
at
the
last
moment
deciding
that
it
would
be
the
act
of
a
fool
and
a
coward
to
decline
what
was
practically
a
personal
request
from
a
young
and
enchanting
woman
he
had
come
to
london
short
of
sleep
it
is
true
owing
to
local
convivialities
but
he
had
come
and
curiously
he
had
not
communicated
with
marrier
marrier
had
been
extremely
taken
up
with
the
dramatic
soirée
of
the
azure
society
which
edward
henry
justifiably
but
quite
privately
resented
was
he
not
paying
three
pounds
a
week
to
marrier
and
now
there
he
sat
known
watched
a
notoriety
the
card
who
had
raised
pilgrim
to
the
skies
probably
the
only
theatrical
proprietor
in
the
crowded
and
silent
audience
and
he
was
expecting
anxiously
to
see
elsie
april
again
across
the
footlights
he
had
not
seen
her
since
the
night
of
the
over
a
week
earlier
he
had
not
sought
to
see
her
he
had
listened
then
to
the
delicate
tones
of
her
weak
whispering
thrilling
voice
and
had
expressed
regret
for
rose
euclid
plight
but
he
had
done
no
more
what
could
he
have
done
clearly
he
could
not
have
offered
money
to
relieve
the
plight
of
rose
euclid
who
was
the
cousin
of
a
girl
as
wealthy
and
as
sympathetic
as
elsie
april
to
do
so
would
have
been
to
insult
elsie
yet
he
felt
guilty
none
the
less
an
odd
situation
the
delicate
tones
of
weak
whispering
thrilling
voice
on
the
scaffolding
haunted
his
memory
and
came
back
with
strange
clearness
as
he
sat
waiting
for
the
curtain
to
ascend
there
was
an
outburst
of
sedate
applause
and
a
turning
of
heads
to
the
right
edward
henry
looked
in
that
direction
rose
euclid
herself
was
bowing
from
one
of
the
two
boxes
on
the
first
tier
instantly
she
had
been
recognized
and
acknowledged
and
the
clapping
had
in
no
wise
disturbed
her
evidently
she
accepted
it
as
a
matter
of
course
how
famous
after
all
she
must
be
if
such
an
audience
would
pay
her
such
a
meed
she
was
pale
and
dressed
glitteringly
in
white
she
seemed
younger
more
graceful
much
more
handsome
more
in
accordance
with
her
renown
she
was
at
home
and
at
ease
up
there
in
the
brightness
of
publicity
the
imposing
legend
of
her
long
career
had
survived
the
eclipse
in
the
united
states
who
could
have
guessed
that
some
ten
days
before
she
had
landed
and
ruined
at
tilbury
from
the
edward
henry
was
impressed
she
none
so
dusty
he
said
to
himself
in
the
incomprehensible
slang
of
the
five
towns
the
phrase
was
a
high
compliment
to
rose
euclid
aged
fifty
and
looking
anything
you
like
over
thirty
it
measured
the
extent
to
which
he
was
impressed
yes
he
felt
guilty
he
had
to
drop
his
eyes
lest
hers
should
catch
them
he
examined
guiltily
the
programme
which
announced
the
new
don
juan
a
play
in
three
acts
and
in
verse
author
unnamed
the
curtain
went
up
ii
and
with
the
rising
of
the
curtain
began
edward
henry
torture
and
bewilderment
the
scene
disclosed
a
cloth
upon
which
was
painted
to
the
right
a
vast
writhing
purple
whose
finer
tentacles
were
lost
above
the
proscenium
arch
and
to
the
left
an
enormous
crimson
oblong
patch
with
a
hole
in
it
he
referred
to
the
programme
which
said
act
ii
or
a
castle
in
a
forest
and
also
scenery
and
costumes
designed
by
saracen
givington
the
then
was
the
purple
forest
or
perhaps
one
tree
in
the
forest
and
the
oblong
patch
was
the
crimson
castle
the
stage
remained
empty
and
edward
henry
had
time
to
perceive
that
the
footlights
were
unlit
and
that
rays
came
only
from
the
flies
and
from
the
wings
he
glanced
round
nobody
had
blenched
quite
confused
he
referred
again
to
the
programme
and
deciphered
in
the
increasing
gloom
lighting
by
cosmo
clark
in
very
large
letters
two
figures
of
no
particular
sex
glided
into
view
and
at
the
first
words
which
they
uttered
edward
henry
heart
seemed
in
apprehension
to
cease
to
beat
a
fear
seized
him
a
few
more
words
and
the
fear
became
a
positive
assurance
and
realization
of
evil
the
new
don
juan
was
simply
a
pseudonym
for
carlo
trent
orient
pearl
he
had
always
known
that
it
would
be
ever
since
deciding
to
accept
the
invitation
he
had
lived
under
just
that
menace
the
orient
pearl
seemed
to
be
pursuing
him
like
a
sinister
destiny
weakly
he
consulted
yet
again
the
programme
only
one
character
bore
a
name
familiar
to
the
don
juan
story
to
wit
haidee
and
opposite
that
name
was
the
name
of
elsie
april
he
waited
for
her
he
had
no
other
interest
in
the
evening
and
he
waited
in
resignation
a
young
female
troubadour
styled
in
the
programme
the
messenger
emerged
from
the
unseen
depths
of
the
forest
in
the
wings
and
ejaculated
to
the
hero
and
his
friend
the
woman
appears
but
it
was
not
elsie
that
appeared
six
times
that
emerged
and
ejaculated
the
woman
appears
and
each
time
edward
henry
was
disappointed
but
at
the
seventh
heralding
the
heralding
of
the
seventh
and
highest
heroine
of
this
drama
in
hexameters
elsie
did
at
length
appear
and
edward
henry
became
happy
he
understood
little
more
of
the
play
than
at
the
historic
of
sir
john
pilgrim
he
was
well
confirmed
in
his
belief
that
the
play
was
exactly
as
preposterous
as
a
play
in
verse
must
necessarily
be
his
manly
contempt
for
verse
was
more
firmly
established
than
ever
but
elsie
april
made
an
exquisite
figure
between
the
castle
and
the
forest
her
voice
did
really
set
up
physical
vibrations
in
his
spine
he
was
deliciously
convinced
that
if
she
remained
on
the
stage
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
just
so
long
could
he
gaze
thereat
without
surfeit
and
without
other
desire
the
mischief
was
that
she
did
not
remain
on
the
stage
with
despair
he
saw
her
depart
and
the
close
of
the
act
was
ashes
in
his
mouth
the
applause
was
tremendous
it
was
not
as
tremendous
as
that
which
had
greeted
the
comedy
at
the
hanbridge
empire
but
it
was
far
more
than
sufficiently
enthusiastic
to
startle
and
shock
edward
henry
in
fact
his
cold
indifference
was
so
conspicuous
amid
that
fever
that
in
order
to
save
his
face
he
had
to
clap
and
to
smile
and
the
dreadful
thought
crossed
his
mind
traversing
it
like
the
shudder
of
a
distant
earthquake
that
presages
complete
destruction
are
the
ideas
of
the
five
towns
all
wrong
am
i
a
provincial
after
all
for
hitherto
though
he
had
often
admitted
to
himself
that
he
was
a
provincial
he
had
never
done
so
with
sincerity
but
always
in
a
manner
of
playful
and
rather
condescending
badinage
iii
did
you
ever
see
such
scenery
and
costumes
someone
addressed
him
suddenly
when
the
applause
had
died
down
it
was
alloyd
who
had
advanced
up
the
aisle
from
a
back
row
of
the
stalls
no
i
never
did
edward
henry
agreed
it
wonderful
how
givington
has
managed
to
get
away
from
the
childish
realism
of
the
modern
theatre
said
alloyd
without
being
ridiculous
you
think
so
said
edward
henry
judicially
the
question
is
has
he
do
you
mean
it
too
realistic
for
you
cried
alloyd
well
you
advanced
i
did
know
you
were
as
as
all
that
neither
did
i
said
edward
henry
what
do
you
think
of
the
play
well
answered
alloyd
low
and
cautiously
with
a
somewhat
shamed
grin
between
you
and
me
i
think
the
play
bosh
come
come
edward
henry
murmured
as
if
in
protest
the
word
bosh
was
almost
the
first
word
of
the
discussion
which
he
had
comprehended
and
the
honest
familiar
sound
of
it
did
him
good
nevertheless
keeping
his
presence
of
mind
he
had
forborne
to
welcome
it
openly
he
wondered
what
on
earth
could
mean
similar
conversations
were
proceeding
around
him
and
each
could
be
very
closely
heard
for
the
reason
that
the
audience
being
frankly
intellectual
and
anxious
to
exchange
ideas
the
management
had
wisely
avoided
the
expense
and
noise
of
an
orchestra
the
was
like
a
conversazione
of
all
the
cultures
i
wish
you
give
us
some
scenery
and
costumes
like
this
in
theatre
said
alloyd
as
he
strolled
away
the
remark
stabbed
him
like
a
needle
the
pain
was
gone
in
an
instant
but
it
left
a
vague
fear
behind
it
as
of
the
menace
of
a
mortal
injury
it
is
a
fact
that
edward
henry
blushed
and
grew
gloomy
and
he
scarcely
knew
why
he
looked
about
him
timidly
half
defiantly
a
woman
in
the
row
in
front
somewhat
to
the
right
leaned
back
and
towards
him
and
behind
her
fan
said
you
the
only
manager
here
machin
how
alive
and
alert
you
are
her
voice
seemed
to
be
charged
with
a
hidden
meaning
think
so
said
edward
henry
he
had
no
idea
who
she
might
be
he
had
probably
shaken
hands
with
her
at
his
but
if
so
he
had
forgotten
her
face
he
was
fast
becoming
one
of
the
oligarchical
few
who
are
recognized
by
far
more
people
than
they
recognize
a
beautiful
play
said
the
woman
not
merely
poetic
but
intellectual
and
an
extraordinarily
acute
criticism
of
modern
conditions
he
nodded
what
do
you
think
of
the
scenery
he
asked
well
of
course
candidly
said
the
woman
i
think
it
silly
i
daresay
i
i
daresay
murmured
edward
henry
they
told
me
you
were
very
ironic
said
she
flushing
but
meek
they
who
who
in
the
world
of
london
had
been
labelling
him
as
ironic
he
was
rather
proud
i
hope
if
you
do
this
kind
of
play
and
we
all
looking
to
you
machin
said
the
lady
making
a
new
start
i
hope
you
go
in
for
these
costumes
and
scenery
that
would
never
do
again
the
stab
of
the
needle
it
would
he
said
i
delighted
you
think
so
said
she
an
orange
telegram
came
travelling
from
hand
to
hand
along
that
row
of
stalls
and
ultimately
after
skipping
a
few
persons
reached
the
woman
who
read
it
and
then
passed
it
to
edward
henry
splendid
she
exclaimed
splendid
edward
henry
read
released
isabel
what
does
it
mean
it
from
isabel
joy
at
marseilles
really
edward
henry
ignorance
of
affairs
round
about
the
centre
of
the
universe
was
occasionally
distressing
to
himself
in
particular
and
just
now
he
gravely
blamed
marrier
who
had
neglected
to
post
him
about
isabel
joy
but
how
could
marrier
honestly
earn
his
three
pounds
a
week
if
he
was
occupied
night
and
day
with
the
organizing
and
management
of
these
precious
dramatic
soirées
edward
henry
decided
that
he
must
give
marrier
a
piece
of
his
mind
at
the
first
opportunity
do
you
know
questioned
the
dame
how
should
i
he
parried
i
only
a
provincial
but
surely
pursued
the
dame
you
knew
we
sent
her
round
the
world
she
started
on
the
the
ship
that
you
stopped
sir
john
pilgrim
from
taking
she
almost
atoned
for
his
absence
at
tilbury
reporters
anyway
edward
henry
sharply
slapped
his
thigh
which
in
the
five
towns
signifies
i
shall
forget
my
own
name
next
of
course
isabel
joy
was
the
advertising
emissary
of
the
militant
suffragette
society
sent
forth
to
hold
a
public
meeting
and
make
a
speech
in
the
principal
ports
of
the
world
she
had
guaranteed
to
circuit
the
globe
and
to
be
back
in
london
within
a
hundred
days
to
speak
in
at
least
five
languages
and
to
get
herself
arrested
at
least
three
times
of
course
isabel
joy
had
possessed
a
very
fair
share
of
the
newspapers
on
the
day
before
the
but
edward
henry
had
naturally
had
too
many
preoccupations
to
follow
her
exploits
after
all
his
momentary
forgetfulness
was
rather
excusable
she
made
a
superb
beginning
said
the
resplendent
dame
taking
the
telegram
from
edward
henry
and
inducting
it
into
another
row
and
before
three
months
are
out
she
be
the
talk
of
the
entire
earth
you
see
is
everybody
a
suffragette
here
asked
edward
henry
simply
as
his
eyes
witnessed
the
satisfaction
spread
by
the
voyaging
telegram
practically
said
the
dame
these
things
always
go
hand
in
hand
she
added
in
a
deep
tone
what
things
the
provincial
demanded
but
just
then
the
curtain
rose
on
the
second
act
iv
wo
you
cam
up
to
miss
april
said
harrier
who
in
the
midst
of
the
fulminating
applause
after
the
second
act
seemed
to
be
inexplicably
standing
over
him
having
appeared
in
an
instant
out
of
nowhere
like
a
genie
the
fact
was
that
edward
henry
had
been
gently
and
innocently
dozing
it
was
in
part
the
deep
obscurity
of
the
auditorium
in
part
his
own
physical
fatigue
and
in
part
the
secret
nature
of
poetry
that
had
been
responsible
for
this
restful
slumber
he
had
remained
awake
without
difficulty
during
the
first
portion
of
the
act
in
which
elsie
april
the
orient
pearl
had
had
a
long
scene
of
emotion
and
tears
played
as
edward
henry
thought
magnificently
in
spite
of
its
inherent
ridiculousness
but
later
when
gentle
haidee
had
vanished
away
and
the
fateful
had
begun
to
resume
her
announcements
of
the
woman
appears
edward
henry
soul
had
miserably
yielded
to
his
body
and
to
the
temptation
of
darkness
the
upturned
lights
and
the
ringing
hosannahs
had
roused
him
to
a
full
sense
of
sin
but
he
had
not
quite
recovered
all
his
faculties
when
marrier
startled
him
yes
yes
of
course
i
was
coming
he
answered
a
little
petulantly
but
no
petulance
could
impair
the
beaming
optimism
on
features
to
judge
by
those
features
marrier
in
addition
to
having
organized
and
managed
the
soirée
might
also
have
written
the
piece
and
played
every
part
in
it
and
founded
the
azure
society
and
built
its
private
theatre
the
hour
was
marrier
elise
april
was
small
and
very
thickly
populated
and
the
threshold
of
it
was
barred
by
eager
persons
who
were
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
room
through
these
marrier
authority
forced
a
way
the
first
man
edward
henry
recognized
in
the
tumult
of
bodies
was
rollo
wrissell
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
their
meeting
at
slossons
wrissell
said
the
glowing
marrier
let
me
introduce
alderman
machin
of
the
regent
theatah
clumsy
fool
thought
edward
henry
and
stood
as
if
entranced
but
wrissell
held
out
a
hand
with
the
perfection
of
urbane
insouciance
how
do
mr
machin
said
he
i
hope
you
forgive
me
for
not
having
followed
your
advice
this
was
a
lesson
to
edward
henry
he
learnt
that
you
should
never
show
a
wound
and
if
possible
never
feel
one
he
admitted
that
in
such
details
of
social
conduct
london
might
be
in
advance
of
the
five
towns
despite
the
five
towns
admirable
downrightness
lady
woldo
was
also
in
the
glorious
in
black
her
beauty
was
positively
disconcerting
and
the
more
so
on
this
occasion
as
she
was
bending
over
the
faded
rose
euclid
who
sat
in
a
corner
surrounded
by
a
court
this
court
comprising
comparatively
uncelebrated
young
women
and
men
listened
with
respect
to
the
conversation
of
the
peeress
who
called
rose
my
dear
the
great
and
the
now
somewhat
notorious
five
towns
character
edward
henry
machin
miss
april
is
splendid
is
she
said
edward
henry
to
lady
woldo
oh
my
word
yes
replied
lady
woldo
nicely
warmly
yet
with
a
certain
perfunctoriness
edward
henry
was
astonished
that
everybody
was
not
passionately
enthusiastic
about
the
charm
of
performance
then
lady
woldo
added
but
what
a
part
for
miss
euclid
what
a
part
for
her
and
there
were
murmurs
of
approbation
rose
euclid
gazed
at
edward
henry
palely
and
weakly
he
considered
her
much
less
effective
here
than
in
her
box
but
her
febrile
gaze
was
effective
enough
to
produce
in
him
the
again
the
feeling
of
gloom
of
pessimism
of
being
gradually
overtaken
by
an
unseen
and
mysterious
avenger
yes
indeed
said
he
he
thought
to
himself
now
the
time
for
me
to
behave
like
edward
henry
machin
and
teach
these
people
a
thing
or
two
but
he
could
not
a
pretty
young
girl
summoned
all
her
forces
to
address
the
great
proprietor
of
the
regent
to
whom
however
she
had
not
been
introduced
and
with
a
charming
nervous
earnest
lisp
said
but
do
you
think
it
a
great
play
mr
machin
of
course
he
replied
inwardly
employing
the
most
fearful
and
shocking
anathemas
we
were
sure
would
the
young
people
glanced
at
each
other
with
the
satisfaction
of
proved
prophets
know
that
not
another
manager
has
taken
the
trouble
to
come
here
said
a
second
earnest
young
woman
edward
henry
was
now
acute
he
would
have
paid
a
ransom
to
be
alone
on
a
desert
island
in
the
indian
seas
he
looked
downwards
and
noticed
that
all
these
bright
eager
persons
women
and
men
were
wearing
blue
stockings
or
socks
miss
april
is
free
now
said
marrier
in
his
ear
the
next
instant
he
was
talking
alone
to
elsie
in
another
corner
while
the
rest
of
the
room
respectfully
observed
so
you
deigned
to
come
said
elsie
april
you
did
get
my
card
a
little
paint
did
her
no
harm
and
the
accentuation
of
her
eyebrows
and
lips
and
the
calculated
disorder
of
her
hair
were
not
more
than
her
powerful
effulgent
physique
could
stand
in
a
costume
of
green
and
silver
she
was
magnificent
overwhelmingly
magnificent
her
varying
voice
and
her
glance
at
once
sincere
timid
and
bold
produced
the
most
singular
sensations
behind
edward
henry
soft
frilled
and
he
thought
that
he
had
never
been
through
any
experience
so
disturbing
and
so
fine
as
just
standing
in
front
of
her
i
ought
to
be
saying
nice
things
to
her
he
reflected
but
no
doubt
because
he
had
been
born
in
the
five
towns
he
could
not
formulate
in
his
mind
a
single
nice
thing
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
asked
looking
full
at
him
and
the
glance
too
had
a
strange
significance
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
are
you
a
man
or
are
you
i
think
you
splendid
he
exclaimed
now
please
she
protested
do
begin
in
that
strain
i
know
very
good
for
an
amateur
but
really
i
not
joking
she
shook
her
head
what
do
you
think
of
my
part
for
rose
would
she
be
tremendous
in
it
would
she
be
tremendous
what
a
chance
he
was
acutely
uncomfortable
but
even
his
discomfort
was
somehow
a
joy
yes
he
admitted
yes
oh
here
carlo
trent
said
she
he
heard
trent
triumphant
voice
carrying
the
end
of
a
conversation
into
the
room
if
he
had
been
going
away
carlo
trent
was
saying
pilgrim
would
have
taken
it
pilgrim
the
poet
eyes
met
edward
henry
and
the
sentence
was
never
finished
how
d
do
machin
murmured
the
poet
then
a
bell
began
to
ring
and
would
not
stop
you
staying
for
the
reception
afterwards
said
elsie
april
as
the
room
emptied
is
there
one
of
course
it
seemed
to
edward
henry
that
they
exchanged
silent
messages
v
some
time
after
the
last
hexameter
had
rolled
forth
and
the
curtain
had
finally
fallen
on
the
immense
and
rapturous
success
of
carlo
trent
play
in
three
acts
and
in
verse
edward
henry
walking
about
the
crowded
stage
where
the
reception
was
being
held
encountered
elsie
april
who
was
still
in
her
gorgeous
dress
of
green
and
silver
she
was
chatting
with
marrier
who
instantly
left
her
thus
displaying
a
discretion
such
as
an
employer
would
naturally
expect
from
a
factotum
to
whom
he
was
paying
three
pounds
a
week
edward
henry
heart
began
to
beat
in
a
manner
which
troubled
him
and
made
him
wonder
what
could
be
happening
at
the
back
of
the
shirt
front
that
he
had
obtained
in
imitation
of
mr
seven
sachs
not
much
here
he
said
lightly
he
was
very
anxious
to
be
equal
to
the
occasion
she
gazed
at
him
under
her
emphasized
eyebrows
he
noticed
that
there
were
little
touches
of
red
on
her
delightful
nostrils
no
she
answered
with
direct
simplicity
suppose
we
try
somewhere
else
she
turned
her
back
on
all
the
amiable
and
intellectual
babble
descended
three
steps
on
the
prompt
side
and
opened
a
door
the
swish
of
her
brocaded
spreading
skirt
was
loud
and
sensuous
he
followed
her
into
an
obscure
chamber
in
which
several
figures
were
moving
to
and
fro
and
talking
what
this
place
he
asked
involuntarily
his
voice
was
diminished
to
a
whisper
it
one
of
the
said
she
it
used
to
be
a
classroom
i
expect
before
the
society
took
the
buildings
over
you
see
the
theatre
was
the
general
schoolroom
they
sat
down
unobtrusively
in
an
embrasure
none
among
the
mysterious
moving
figures
seemed
to
remark
them
but
why
are
they
talking
in
the
dark
edward
henry
asked
behind
his
hand
to
begin
with
it
is
quite
dark
she
said
there
the
light
of
the
through
the
window
but
it
has
been
found
that
serious
discussions
can
be
carried
on
much
better
without
too
much
light
i
not
joking
it
was
as
if
in
the
gloom
her
ears
had
caught
his
faint
sardonic
smile
said
the
voice
of
one
of
the
figures
can
you
tell
me
what
is
the
origin
of
the
decay
of
realism
can
you
tell
me
that
suddenly
in
the
ensuing
silence
there
was
a
click
and
a
tiny
electric
lamp
shot
its
beam
the
hand
which
held
the
lamp
was
the
hand
of
carlo
trent
he
flashed
it
and
flashed
the
trembling
ray
in
the
inquirer
face
edward
henry
recalled
carlo
objection
to
excessive
electricity
in
the
private
at
wilkins
why
do
you
ask
such
a
question
carlo
trent
challenged
the
inquirer
brandishing
the
lamp
i
ask
you
why
do
you
ask
it
the
other
also
drew
forth
a
lamp
and
as
it
were
cocked
it
and
let
it
off
at
the
features
of
carlo
trent
and
thus
the
two
stood
statuesque
and
lit
surrounded
by
shadowy
witnessers
of
the
discussion
the
door
creaked
and
yet
another
figure
silhouetted
for
an
instant
against
the
illumination
of
the
stage
descended
into
the
discussion
chamber
carlo
trent
tripped
towards
the
bent
with
his
lamp
lifted
delicately
the
hem
of
the
trousers
and
gazed
at
the
colour
of
his
sock
which
was
blue
all
right
said
he
the
champagne
and
sandwiches
are
served
said
the
you
not
answered
me
sir
carlo
trent
faced
once
more
his
opponent
in
the
discussion
you
not
answered
me
whereupon
the
lamps
being
extinguished
they
all
filed
forth
the
door
swung
to
of
its
own
accord
shutting
out
the
sound
of
babble
from
the
stage
and
edward
henry
and
elsie
april
were
left
silent
and
solitary
to
the
sole
ray
of
the
all
the
five
towns
shrewdness
in
edward
henry
character
all
the
husband
in
him
all
the
father
in
him
all
the
son
in
him
leapt
to
his
lips
and
tried
to
say
to
elsie
shall
go
and
inspect
the
champagne
and
sandwiches
too
and
failed
to
say
these
incantatory
words
of
salvation
and
the
romantic
adventurous
fool
in
him
rejoiced
at
their
failure
for
he
was
adventurously
happy
in
his
propinquity
to
that
simple
and
sincere
creature
he
was
so
happy
and
his
heart
was
so
active
that
he
even
made
no
caustic
characteristic
comment
on
the
singular
behaviour
of
the
beings
who
had
just
abandoned
them
to
their
loneliness
he
was
also
proud
because
he
was
sitting
alone
nearly
in
the
dark
with
a
piquant
and
wealthy
albeit
amateur
actress
who
had
just
participated
in
a
triumph
at
which
the
spiritual
aristocracy
of
london
had
assisted
vi
two
thoughts
ran
through
his
head
shooting
in
and
out
and
to
and
fro
among
his
complex
sensations
of
pleasure
the
first
was
that
he
had
never
been
in
such
a
fix
before
despite
his
enterprising
habits
and
the
second
was
that
neither
elsie
april
nor
anybody
else
connected
with
his
affairs
in
london
had
ever
asked
him
whether
he
was
married
or
assumed
by
any
detail
of
behaviour
towards
him
that
there
existed
the
possibility
of
his
being
married
of
course
he
might
had
he
chosen
have
informed
a
few
of
them
that
a
wife
and
children
possessed
him
but
then
really
would
not
that
have
been
equivalent
to
attaching
a
label
to
himself
married
a
procedure
which
had
to
him
the
stamp
of
provinciality
elsie
april
said
nothing
and
as
she
said
nothing
he
was
obliged
to
say
something
if
only
to
prove
to
both
of
them
that
he
was
not
a
mere
provincial
he
said
you
know
i
feel
awfully
out
of
it
here
in
this
society
of
yours
out
of
it
she
exclaimed
and
her
voice
thrilled
as
she
resented
his
it
over
my
head
right
over
it
now
machin
she
said
dropping
somewhat
that
rich
low
voice
i
quite
understand
that
there
are
some
things
about
the
society
you
do
like
trifles
that
you
inclined
to
laugh
at
know
that
many
of
us
know
it
but
it
ca
be
helped
in
an
organization
like
ours
it
even
essential
do
be
too
hard
on
us
do
be
sarcastic
but
i
not
sarcastic
he
protested
honest
she
turned
to
him
quickly
he
could
descry
her
face
in
the
gloom
and
the
forward
bend
of
her
shoulders
and
the
backward
sweep
of
her
arms
resting
on
the
seat
and
the
straight
droop
of
her
egyptian
shawl
from
her
inclined
body
honest
he
solemnly
insisted
the
exchange
of
this
single
word
was
so
intimate
that
it
shifted
their
conversation
to
a
different
level
level
at
which
each
seemed
to
be
assuring
the
other
that
intercourse
between
them
could
never
be
aught
but
utterly
sincere
thenceforward
and
that
indeed
in
future
they
would
constitute
a
little
society
of
their
own
ideal
in
its
organization
then
you
too
modest
she
said
decidedly
there
was
no
one
here
who
more
respected
than
you
are
no
one
immediately
i
first
spoke
to
you
i
daresay
you
do
remember
that
afternoon
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
i
knew
you
were
like
the
rest
and
do
i
know
them
do
i
know
them
but
how
did
you
know
i
not
like
the
rest
asked
edward
henry
the
line
which
she
was
taking
had
very
much
surprised
him
and
charmed
him
the
compliment
so
serious
and
urgent
in
tone
was
intensely
agreeable
and
it
made
an
entirely
new
experience
in
his
career
he
thought
oh
there
no
mistake
about
it
these
london
women
are
marvellous
they
just
as
straight
and
in
earnest
as
the
best
of
our
little
lot
down
there
but
they
got
something
else
no
comparison
the
unique
word
to
describe
the
indescribable
floated
into
his
head
scrumptious
what
could
not
life
be
with
such
creatures
he
dreamt
of
art
softly
shaded
at
midnight
and
his
attitude
towards
even
poetry
was
modified
i
knew
you
were
like
the
rest
said
she
by
your
look
by
the
way
you
say
everything
you
say
we
all
know
it
and
i
sure
you
far
more
than
clever
enough
to
be
perfectly
aware
that
we
all
know
it
just
see
how
everyone
looked
at
you
yes
he
had
in
fact
been
aware
of
the
glances
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
went
on
that
i
was
rather
unfair
to
you
that
day
in
talking
about
my
cousin
in
the
taxi
you
were
quite
right
to
refuse
to
go
into
partnership
with
her
she
thinks
so
too
we
talked
it
over
and
we
quite
agreed
of
course
it
did
seem
hard
at
the
time
and
her
bad
luck
in
america
seemed
to
make
it
worse
but
you
were
quite
right
you
can
work
much
better
alone
you
must
have
felt
that
instinctively
far
quicker
than
we
felt
it
well
he
murmured
confused
i
do
know
could
this
be
she
who
had
too
openly
smiled
at
his
skirmish
with
an
artichoke
oh
mr
machin
she
burst
out
you
got
an
unprecedented
opportunity
and
thank
heaven
you
the
man
to
use
it
we
all
expecting
so
much
from
you
and
we
know
we
sha
be
disappointed
d
mean
the
theatre
he
asked
alarmed
as
it
were
amid
rising
waters
the
theatre
said
she
gravely
you
the
one
man
that
can
save
london
no
one
london
can
do
it
have
the
happiness
of
knowing
what
your
mission
is
and
of
knowing
too
that
you
are
equal
to
it
what
good
fortune
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
for
myself
i
want
to
do
something
i
try
but
what
can
i
do
nothing
really
you
no
idea
of
the
awful
loneliness
that
comes
from
a
feeling
of
inability
loneliness
he
repeated
but
surely
he
stopped
loneliness
she
insisted
her
little
chin
was
now
in
her
little
hand
and
her
dim
face
upturned
and
suddenly
a
sensation
of
absolute
and
marvellous
terror
seized
edward
henry
he
was
more
afraid
than
he
had
ever
been
and
yet
once
or
twice
in
his
life
he
had
felt
fear
his
sense
of
true
perspective
one
of
his
most
precious
qualities
returned
he
thought
i
got
to
get
out
of
this
well
the
door
was
not
locked
it
was
only
necessary
to
turn
the
handle
and
security
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
he
had
but
to
rise
and
walk
and
he
could
not
he
might
just
as
well
have
been
manacled
in
a
he
was
under
an
enchantment
a
man
murmured
elsie
a
man
can
never
realize
the
loneliness
she
ceased
he
stirred
uneasily
about
this
play
he
found
himself
saying
and
yet
why
should
he
mention
the
play
in
his
fright
he
pretended
to
himself
not
to
know
why
but
he
knew
why
his
instinct
had
seen
in
the
topic
of
the
play
the
sole
avenue
of
salvation
a
wonderful
thing
is
it
oh
yes
he
said
and
then
most
astonishingly
to
himself
added
i
decided
to
do
it
we
knew
you
would
she
said
calmly
at
any
rate
i
did
open
with
it
of
course
yes
he
answered
desperately
and
proceeded
with
the
most
extraordinary
bravery
if
you
act
in
it
immediately
on
hearing
these
last
words
issue
from
his
mouth
he
knew
that
a
fool
had
uttered
them
and
that
the
bravery
was
mere
rashness
for
elsie
responding
gesture
reinspired
him
afresh
with
the
exquisite
terror
which
he
had
already
begun
to
conjure
away
you
think
miss
euclid
ought
to
have
the
part
he
added
quickly
before
she
could
speak
oh
i
do
cried
elsie
positively
and
eagerly
rose
will
do
simply
wonders
with
that
part
you
see
she
can
speak
verse
i
ca
nobody
i
only
took
it
because
are
you
anybody
he
contradicted
are
you
anybody
i
can
just
tell
you
there
he
was
again
bringing
back
the
delicious
terror
an
astounding
situation
but
the
door
creaked
the
babble
from
the
stage
invaded
the
room
and
in
a
second
the
enchantment
was
lifted
from
him
several
people
entered
he
sighed
saying
within
himself
to
the
disturbers
i
have
given
you
a
hundred
pounds
apiece
if
you
been
five
minutes
sooner
and
yet
simultaneously
he
regretted
their
arrival
and
more
curious
still
though
he
well
remembered
the
warning
words
of
mr
seven
sachs
concerning
elsie
april
he
did
not
consider
that
they
were
justified
she
had
not
been
a
bit
persuasive
only
vii
he
sat
down
to
the
pianisto
with
a
strange
and
agreeable
sense
of
security
it
is
true
that
owing
to
the
time
of
year
the
had
been
in
the
figurative
phrase
turned
upside
down
by
the
process
of
which
his
unexpected
arrival
had
surprised
in
fullest
activity
but
he
did
not
mind
that
he
abode
content
among
rolled
carpets
a
swathed
chandelier
piled
chairs
and
walls
full
of
pale
rectangular
spaces
where
pictures
had
been
early
that
morning
after
a
brief
night
spent
partly
in
bed
and
partly
in
erect
contemplation
of
his
immediate
past
and
his
immediate
future
he
had
hurried
back
to
his
pianisto
and
his
home
to
the
beings
and
things
that
he
knew
and
that
knew
him
in
the
train
he
had
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
in
sundry
newspapers
that
the
orient
pearl
by
carlo
trent
who
was
mentioned
in
terms
of
startling
respect
and
admiration
had
been
performed
on
the
previous
evening
at
the
dramatic
soirée
of
the
azure
society
with
all
the
usual
accompaniments
of
secrecy
and
exclusiveness
in
its
private
theatre
in
kensington
and
had
been
accepted
on
the
spot
by
machin
that
most
enterprising
and
enlightened
recruit
to
the
ranks
of
theatrical
managers
for
production
at
the
new
regent
theatre
and
further
that
machin
intended
to
open
with
it
and
still
further
that
his
selection
of
such
a
play
which
combined
in
the
highest
degree
the
poetry
of
yeats
with
the
critical
intellectuality
of
bernard
shaw
was
an
excellent
augury
for
london
dramatic
future
and
that
the
upward
movement
must
on
no
account
be
thought
to
have
failed
because
of
the
failure
of
certain
recent
attempts
by
persons
who
did
not
understand
their
business
to
force
it
in
particular
directions
and
still
further
that
he
edward
henry
had
engaged
for
the
principal
part
miss
rose
euclid
perhaps
the
greatest
emotional
actress
the
peoples
had
ever
had
but
who
unfortunately
had
not
been
sufficiently
seen
of
late
on
the
london
stage
and
that
this
would
be
her
first
appearance
after
her
recent
artistic
successes
in
the
united
states
and
lastly
that
marrier
whose
name
would
be
remembered
in
connection
with
etc
was
machin
acting
manager
and
technical
adviser
edward
henry
could
trace
the
hand
of
marrier
in
all
the
paragraphs
marrier
had
lost
no
time
machin
senior
came
into
the
just
as
he
was
adjusting
the
tannhäuser
overture
to
the
mechanician
the
piece
was
one
of
his
major
favourites
this
is
no
place
for
you
my
lad
said
machin
grimly
glancing
round
the
room
but
i
came
to
tell
ye
as
th
mutton
been
cooling
at
least
five
minutes
you
gave
out
as
you
were
hungry
keep
your
hair
on
mother
said
he
springing
up
barely
twelve
hours
earlier
he
had
been
mincing
among
the
elect
and
the
select
and
the
intellectual
and
the
poetic
and
the
aristocratic
among
the
and
kensingtonian
accents
among
rouged
lips
and
blue
hose
and
fixed
simperings
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
he
had
conducted
himself
with
considerable
skill
accordingly
nobody
on
the
previous
night
could
have
guessed
from
the
cut
of
his
fancy
waistcoat
or
the
judiciousness
of
his
responses
to
remarks
about
verse
that
his
wife
often
wore
a
white
apron
or
that
his
mother
was
the
woman
she
was
he
had
not
unskilfully
caught
many
of
the
tricks
of
that
metropolitan
environment
but
now
they
all
fell
away
from
him
and
he
was
just
edward
henry
nay
he
was
almost
the
old
denry
again
who
chose
this
mutton
he
asked
as
he
bent
over
the
juicy
and
rich
joint
and
cut
therefrom
exquisite
thick
slices
with
a
like
a
razor
did
if
ye
want
to
know
said
his
mother
anything
amiss
with
it
she
challenged
no
it
fine
yes
said
she
i
wondering
whether
you
get
aught
as
good
as
that
in
those
grand
hotels
as
you
call
we
do
said
edward
henry
first
it
was
true
and
secondly
he
was
anxious
to
be
propitiatory
for
he
had
a
plan
to
further
he
looked
at
his
wife
she
was
not
talkative
but
she
had
received
him
in
the
hall
with
every
detail
of
affection
if
a
little
owing
to
the
state
of
the
house
she
had
not
been
caustic
like
his
mother
about
this
male
incursion
into
she
had
not
informed
the
surrounding
air
that
she
failed
to
understand
why
them
as
were
in
london
could
stop
in
london
for
a
bit
as
his
mother
had
moreover
though
the
fully
entitled
her
to
wear
a
white
apron
at
meals
she
was
not
wearing
a
white
apron
which
was
a
sign
to
him
that
she
still
loved
him
enough
to
want
to
please
him
on
the
whole
he
was
fairly
optimistic
about
his
plan
of
salvation
nevertheless
it
was
not
until
nearly
the
end
of
the
meal
when
one
of
his
mother
was
being
consumed
that
he
began
to
try
to
broach
it
nell
he
said
i
suppose
you
would
care
to
come
to
london
with
me
oh
she
answered
smiling
a
smile
of
a
peculiar
quality
it
was
astonishing
how
that
simple
woman
could
put
just
one
tenth
of
one
per
cent
of
irony
into
a
smile
what
the
meaning
of
this
then
she
flushed
the
flush
touched
edward
henry
in
an
extraordinary
manner
to
think
he
reflected
incredulously
that
only
last
night
i
was
talking
in
the
dark
to
elsie
april
and
here
i
am
now
and
he
remembered
the
glory
of
elsie
frock
and
her
thrilling
voice
in
the
gloom
and
that
pose
of
hers
as
she
leaned
dimly
forward
well
he
said
aloud
as
naturally
as
he
could
that
beginning
to
get
up
on
its
now
and
i
should
like
you
to
see
it
a
difficult
pass
for
him
as
regards
his
mother
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
overtly
spoken
of
the
theatre
in
his
presence
in
the
best
bedroom
he
had
talked
of
it
but
even
there
with
a
certain
and
false
casualness
now
his
mother
stared
straight
in
front
of
her
with
an
expression
of
which
she
alone
among
human
beings
had
the
monopoly
i
should
like
to
said
nellie
generously
well
said
he
i
got
to
go
back
to
town
wilt
come
with
me
lass
do
be
silly
edward
henry
said
she
how
can
i
leave
mother
in
the
middle
of
all
this
you
need
leave
mother
we
take
her
too
said
edward
henry
lightly
you
wo
observed
machin
i
go
nell
said
edward
henry
and
i
was
thinking
you
might
as
well
come
with
me
it
will
be
a
change
for
you
he
said
to
himself
and
not
only
have
i
to
go
but
you
absolutely
must
come
with
me
my
girl
that
the
one
thing
to
do
it
would
be
a
change
for
me
nellie
agreed
she
was
beyond
doubt
flattered
and
calmly
pleased
but
i
ca
possibly
come
you
can
see
that
for
yourself
dear
no
i
ca
he
cried
impatiently
what
does
it
matter
be
here
the
kids
be
all
right
after
all
the
day
of
judgment
edward
henry
said
his
mother
cutting
in
between
them
like
a
thin
blade
i
wish
you
would
be
blasphemous
london
london
and
bursley
bursley
she
had
finished
it
quite
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
come
dear
i
must
have
notice
i
really
must
and
edward
henry
saw
with
alarm
that
nellie
had
made
up
her
mind
and
that
the
flattered
calm
pleasure
in
his
suggestion
had
faded
from
her
face
oh
dash
these
domesticated
women
he
thought
and
shortly
afterwards
departed
brooding
to
the
offices
of
the
thrift
club
viii
he
timed
his
return
with
exactitude
and
going
straight
upstairs
to
the
chamber
known
indifferently
as
maisie
room
or
nurse
room
sure
enough
he
found
the
three
children
there
alone
they
were
fed
washed
and
even
and
this
was
the
hour
when
while
nurse
repaired
the
consequences
of
their
revolutionary
conduct
in
the
bathroom
and
other
places
they
were
left
to
themselves
robert
lay
on
the
hearthrug
the
insteps
of
his
soft
pink
feet
rubbing
idly
against
the
pile
of
the
rug
his
elbows
digging
into
the
pile
his
chin
on
his
fists
and
a
book
perpendicularly
beneath
his
eyes
ralph
careless
adventurer
rather
than
student
had
climbed
to
the
glittering
brass
rail
of
maisie
new
bedstead
and
was
thereon
imitating
a
circus
performance
maisie
in
the
bed
according
to
regulation
and
lying
on
the
flat
of
her
back
was
singing
nonchalantly
to
the
ceiling
carlo
unaware
that
at
that
moment
he
might
have
been
a
buried
corpse
but
for
the
benignancy
of
providence
in
his
behalf
was
feeling
sympathetic
towards
himself
because
he
was
slightly
bored
hello
kids
edward
henry
greeted
them
as
he
had
seen
them
before
dinner
the
more
formal
ceremonies
of
salutation
after
absence
so
hateful
to
the
five
towns
temperament
were
happily
over
and
done
with
robert
turned
his
head
slightly
inspected
his
father
with
a
judicial
detachment
that
hardly
escaped
the
inimical
and
then
resumed
his
book
no
one
would
think
said
edward
henry
to
himself
that
the
person
who
has
just
entered
this
room
is
the
most
enterprising
and
enlightened
of
west
end
theatrical
managers
father
shrilled
ralph
come
and
help
me
to
stand
on
this
it
is
a
said
robert
from
the
hearthrug
without
stirring
it
a
yes
it
is
a
because
i
can
make
it
bend
ralph
retorted
bumping
down
on
the
thing
anyhow
it
going
to
be
a
maisie
simply
stuck
several
fingers
into
her
mouth
shifted
to
one
side
and
smiled
at
her
father
in
a
style
of
heavenly
and
mischievous
flirtatiousness
well
robert
what
are
you
reading
edward
henry
inquired
in
his
best
fatherly
manner
half
authoritative
and
half
humorous
while
he
formed
part
of
the
staff
of
ralph
circus
i
not
reading
i
learning
my
spellings
replied
robert
edward
henry
knowing
that
the
discipline
of
filial
politeness
must
be
maintained
said
my
spellings
what
learning
my
spellings
father
robert
consented
to
say
but
with
a
savage
air
of
giving
way
to
the
unreasonable
demands
of
affected
fools
why
indeed
should
it
be
necessary
in
conversation
always
to
end
one
sentence
with
the
name
or
title
of
the
person
addressed
well
would
you
like
to
go
to
london
with
me
when
the
boy
demanded
cautiously
he
still
did
not
move
but
his
ears
seemed
to
prick
up
no
thanks
father
his
ears
ceased
their
activity
no
why
not
because
there
a
spellings
examination
on
friday
and
i
going
to
be
it
was
a
fact
that
the
infant
whose
programmes
were
always
somehow
arranged
in
advance
and
were
in
his
mind
absolutely
unalterable
could
spell
the
most
obstreperous
words
quite
conceivably
he
could
spell
better
than
his
father
who
still
showed
an
occasional
tendency
to
write
separate
with
three
e
and
only
one
a
london
a
fine
place
said
edward
henry
i
know
said
robert
negligently
what
the
population
of
london
i
do
know
said
robert
with
curtness
though
he
added
after
a
pause
but
i
can
spell
population
p

come
to
london
father
if
you
have
me
said
ralph
grinning
will
you
said
his
father
fahver
asked
maisie
wriggling
have
you
brought
me
a
doll
i
afraid
i
have
mother
said
you
would
it
was
true
there
had
been
talk
of
a
doll
he
had
forgotten
it
i

you
what
i

said
edward
henry
i
take
you
to
london
and
you
can
choose
a
doll
in
london
you
never
saw
such
dolls
as
there
are
in
london
talking
dolls
that
shut
and
open
their
eyes
and
say
papa
and
mamma
and
all
their
clothes
take
off
and
on
do
they
say
growled
robert
no
they
do
said
edward
henry
why
do
they
growled
robert
when
will
you
take
me
maisie
almost
squealed
certain
sure
fahver
yes
you
promise
fahver
of
course
i
promise
robert
at
length
stood
up
to
judge
for
himself
this
strange
and
agitating
caprice
of
his
father
for
taking
maisie
to
london
he
saw
that
despite
spellings
it
would
never
do
to
let
maisie
alone
go
he
was
about
to
put
his
father
through
a
but
henry
edward
dropped
ralph
who
had
been
climbing
up
him
as
up
a
telegraph
pole
on
to
the
bed
and
went
over
to
the
window
nervously
and
tapped
thereon
carlo
followed
him
wagging
an
untidy
tail
hello
trent
murmured
edward
henry
stooping
and
patting
the
dog
ralph
exploded
into
loud
laughter
father
called
he
roared
father
have
you
forgotten
his
name
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
jokes
that
ralph
had
heard
for
a
long
time
then
nellie
hurried
into
the
room
and
edward
henry
with
a
be
late
for
tea
as
hurriedly
left
it
three
minutes
later
while
he
was
bent
over
the
lavatory
basin
someone
burst
into
the
bathroom
he
lifted
a
soapy
face
it
was
nellie
with
disturbed
features
what
this
about
your
positively
promising
to
take
maisie
to
london
to
choose
a
doll
i
take
all
he
replied
with
absurd
levity
and
you
too
but
really
she
pouted
indicating
that
he
must
not
carry
the
ridiculous
too
far
look
here
d
n
it
he
said
impulsively
i
you
to
come
and
i
want
you
to
come
i
knew
it
was
the
confounded
infants
you
would
leave
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
ca
arrange
it
a
woman
like
you
she
hesitated
and
what
am
i
to
do
with
three
children
in
a
london
hotel
take
nurse
naturally
take
nurse
she
cried
he
imitated
her
with
a
grotesque
exaggeration
yelling
loudly
take
nurse
then
he
planted
a
on
her
fresh
cheek
she
wiped
it
off
carefully
and
smacked
his
arm
the
next
moment
she
was
gone
having
left
the
door
open
he
me
to
go
to
london
he
could
hear
her
saying
to
his
mother
on
the
landing
confound
it
he
thought
did
she
know
that
at
bless
us
his
mother
voice
and
take
the
children
and
nurse
his
wife
continued
in
a
tone
to
convey
the
fact
that
she
was
just
as
much
disturbed
as
her
could
possibly
be
by
the
eccentricities
of
the
male
he
his
father
all
over
that
lad
is
said
his
mother
strangely
and
edward
henry
was
impressed
by
these
words
for
not
once
in
seven
years
did
his
mother
mention
his
father
tea
was
an
exciting
meal
you
better
come
too
mother
said
edward
henry
audaciously
shut
the
house
up
i
come
to
no
london
said
she
well
then
you
can
use
the
motor
as
much
as
you
like
while
away
i
go
about
gallivanting
in
no
motor
said
his
mother
it
take
me
all
my
time
to
get
this
house
straight
against
you
come
back
i
have
a
to
go
in
said
nellie
with
a
martyr
sigh
after
all
he
reflected
though
domesticated
she
was
a
woman
he
went
to
bed
early
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
wife
his
mother
and
the
nurse
were
active
and
whispering
up
and
down
the
house
till
the
very
middle
of
the
night
he
arose
not
late
but
they
were
all
three
afoot
before
him
active
and
whispering
ix
he
found
out
on
the
morning
after
the
highly
complex
transaction
of
getting
his
family
from
bursley
to
london
that
london
held
more
problems
for
him
than
ever
he
was
now
not
merely
the
proprietor
of
a
theatre
approaching
completion
but
really
a
theatrical
manager
with
a
play
to
produce
artistes
to
engage
and
the
public
to
attract
he
had
made
two
appointments
for
that
morning
at
the
majestic
he
was
not
at
the
grand
babylon
because
his
wife
had
once
stayed
with
him
at
the
majestic
and
he
did
not
want
to
add
to
his
anxieties
the
business
of
accustoming
her
to
a
new
and
costlier
luxury
one
appointment
at
nine
with
marrier
and
the
other
at
ten
with
nellie
family
and
nurse
he
had
expected
to
get
rid
of
marrier
before
ten
among
the
exciting
mail
which
marrier
had
collected
for
him
from
the
grand
babylon
and
elsewhere
was
the
following
letter
buckingham
palace
hotel
dear
friend
we
are
all
so
proud
of
you
i
should
like
some
time
to
finish
our
interrupted
conversation
will
you
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
one
day
here
at
you
need
write
i
know
how
busy
you
are
just
telephone
you
are
coming
but
do
telephone
between
and
because
at
that
time
i
take
my
constitutional
in
yours
sincerely
well
he
thought
that
a
bit
thick
that
is
she
stuck
me
up
with
a
dramatist
i
do
believe
in
and
a
play
i
do
believe
in
and
an
actress
i
do
believe
in
and
now
she
nevertheless
to
a
certain
extent
he
was
bluffing
himself
for
as
he
pretended
to
put
elsie
april
back
into
her
place
he
had
disturbing
and
delightful
visions
of
her
a
clever
creature
uncannily
clever
wealthy
under
thirty
no
provincial
prejudices
her
voice
that
always
affected
his
spine
her
delicious
flattery
she
was
no
mean
actress
either
and
the
multifariousness
of
her
seductive
charm
in
fact
she
was
a
regular
woman
of
the
world
such
as
you
would
read
about
if
you
did
read
he
was
sitting
with
her
again
in
the
obscurity
of
the
at
the
azure
establishment
his
heart
was
beating
again
pooh
a
single
wrench
and
he
ripped
up
the
letter
and
cast
it
into
one
of
the
baskets
with
which
the
immense
and
rather
shabby
of
the
majestic
was
dotted
before
he
had
finished
dealing
with
marrier
queries
and
suggestions
some
ten
thousand
in
all
the
clock
struck
and
nellie
tripped
into
the
room
she
was
in
black
silk
with
hints
here
and
there
of
gold
chains
as
she
had
explained
she
had
nothing
to
wear
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
fall
back
on
the
final
resource
of
every
woman
in
her
state
for
in
this
connection
nothing
to
wear
signified
nothing
except
my
black
silk
at
any
rate
in
the
five
towns
marrier
my
wife
nellie
this
is
mr
marrier
marrier
was
profuse
no
other
word
would
describe
his
demeanour
nellie
had
the
timidity
of
a
young
girl
indeed
she
looked
quite
youthful
despite
the
ageing
influences
of
black
silk
so
that
your
marrier
i
understood
from
you
he
was
a
clerk
said
nellie
tartly
suddenly
retransformed
into
the
shrewd
matron
as
soon
as
marrier
had
profusely
gone
she
had
conceived
marrier
as
a
sort
of
penkethman
edward
henry
had
hoped
to
avoid
this
interview
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
answer
to
his
wife
remark
well
he
said
where
are
the
kids
waiting
in
the
lounge
with
nurse
as
you
said
to
be
her
mien
delicately
informed
him
that
while
in
london
his
caprices
would
be
her
law
which
she
would
obey
without
seeking
to
comprehend
well
he
went
on
i
expect
they
like
the
parks
as
well
as
anything
suppose
we
take
and
show
one
of
the
parks
shall
we
besides
they
must
have
fresh
air
all
right
nellie
agreed
but
how
far
will
it
be
oh
said
edward
henry
we
crowd
into
a
taxi
they
crowded
into
a
taxi
and
the
children
found
their
father
in
high
spirits
maisie
mentioned
the
doll
in
a
minute
the
taxi
had
stopped
in
front
of
a
surpassing
dreams
and
they
invaded
the
like
an
army
when
they
emerged
after
a
considerable
interval
nurse
was
carrying
an
enormous
doll
and
nellie
was
carrying
maisie
and
ralph
was
lovingly
stroking
the
doll
real
shoes
robert
kept
a
profound
silence
a
silence
which
had
begun
in
the
train
you
have
got
much
to
say
robert
his
father
remarked
when
the
taxi
set
off
again
i
know
said
robert
gruffly
among
other
things
he
resented
his
best
clothes
on
a
what
do
you
think
of
london
i
do
know
said
robert
his
eyes
never
left
the
window
of
the
taxi
then
they
visited
the
theatre
a
very
fatiguing
enterprise
and
also
for
edward
henry
a
very
nervous
one
he
was
as
awkward
in
displaying
that
inchoate
theatre
as
a
father
with
his
pride
and
shame
fought
for
dominion
over
him
nellie
was
full
of
laudations
ralph
enjoyed
the
ladders
i
say
said
nellie
apprehensive
for
maisie
on
the
pavement
this
child
exhausted
already
how
big
this
park
of
yours
because
neither
nurse
nor
i
can
carry
her
very
far
we
buy
a
pram
said
edward
henry
he
was
staring
at
a
newspaper
placard
which
said
isabel
joy
on
the
again
will
she
win
but
oh
yes
we
buy
a
pram
driver
a
pram
is
enough
you
want
coverings
for
her
in
this
wind
well
we
buy
the
necessary
number
of
and
blankets
then
said
edward
henry
driver
a
tremendous
business
for
in
addition
to
making
the
purchases
he
had
to
feed
his
flock
in
an
shop
where
among
the
unoccupied
waitresses
maisie
and
her
talkative
winking
doll
enjoyed
a
triumph
still
there
was
plenty
of
time
at
a
quarter
past
twelve
he
was
displaying
the
varied
landscape
beauties
of
the
park
to
his
family
ralph
insisted
on
going
to
the
bridge
over
the
lake
and
robert
silently
backed
him
and
therefore
the
entire
party
went
but
maisie
was
afraid
of
the
water
and
cried
now
the
worst
thing
about
maisie
was
that
when
once
she
had
begun
to
cry
it
was
very
difficult
to
stop
her
even
the
most
remarkable
dolls
were
powerless
to
appease
her
distress
give
me
the
confounded
pram
nurse
said
edward
henry
i
cure
her
but
he
did
not
cure
her
however
he
had
to
stick
grimly
to
the
perambulator
nellie
tripped
primly
in
black
silk
on
one
side
of
it
nurse
had
the
wayward
ralph
by
the
hand
and
robert
taciturn
stalked
alone
adding
up
london
and
making
a
very
small
total
of
it
suddenly
edward
henry
halted
the
perambulator
and
stepping
away
from
it
raised
his
hat
an
excessively
elegant
young
woman
leading
a
pekinese
by
a
silver
chain
stopped
as
if
smitten
by
a
magic
dart
and
held
spellbound
how
do
you
do
miss
april
said
edward
henry
loudly
i
was
hoping
to
meet
you
this
is
my
wife
nellie
this
is
miss
april
nellie
bowed
stiffly
in
her
black
silk
naught
of
the
fresh
maiden
about
her
now
and
it
has
to
be
said
that
elsie
april
in
all
her
young
and
radiant
splendour
and
was
equally
stiff
and
there
are
my
two
boys
and
this
is
my
little
girl
in
the
pram
maisie
screamed
and
pushed
an
expensive
doll
out
of
the
perambulator
edward
henry
saved
it
by
its
boot
as
it
fell
and
this
is
her
doll
and
this
is
nurse
he
finished
fine
breezy
morning
is
it
in
due
course
the
processions
moved
on
well
that
done
edward
henry
muttered
to
himself
and
sighed
chapter
ix
the
first
night
i
it
was
upon
an
evening
in
june
and
a
fine
evening
full
of
the
exquisite
melancholy
of
summer
in
a
city
that
edward
henry
stood
before
a
window
drumming
thereon
as
he
had
once
a
man
with
hair
slightly
less
grey
drummed
on
the
table
of
the
mighty
and
arrogant
slosson
the
window
was
the
window
of
the
managerial
room
of
the
regent
theatre
and
he
could
scarcely
believe
it
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
was
not
in
a
dream
for
the
room
was
papered
carpeted
and
otherwise
furnished
only
its
electric
light
fittings
were
somewhat
hasty
and
provisional
and
the
white
ceiling
showed
a
hole
and
a
bunch
of
wires
like
the
nerves
of
a
hollow
tooth
whence
one
of
edward
henry
favourite
chandeliers
would
ultimately
depend
the
whole
of
the
theatre
was
at
least
as
far
advanced
towards
completion
as
that
room
a
great
deal
of
it
was
more
advanced
for
instance
the
auditorium
and
bars
which
were
utterly
finished
so
far
as
anything
ever
is
finished
in
a
changing
world
wonders
marvels
and
miracles
had
been
accomplished
alloyd
in
the
stress
of
the
job
had
even
ceased
to
bring
the
russian
ballet
into
his
conversations
alloyd
despite
a
growing
tendency
to
prove
to
edward
henry
by
authentic
anecdote
about
midnight
his
general
proposition
that
women
as
a
sex
treated
him
with
shameful
unfairness
had
gained
the
high
esteem
of
edward
henry
as
an
architect
he
had
fulfilled
his
word
about
those
properties
of
the
auditorium
which
had
to
do
with
hearing
and
seeing
in
so
much
that
the
auditorium
was
indeed
unique
in
london
and
he
had
taken
care
that
the
clerk
of
the
works
took
care
that
the
builder
did
not
give
up
heart
in
the
race
with
time
moreover
he
had
maintained
the
peace
with
the
terrible
london
county
council
all
of
whose
inspecting
departments
seemed
to
have
secretly
decided
that
the
regent
theatre
should
be
opened
not
in
june
as
edward
henry
had
decided
but
at
some
vague
future
date
towards
the
middle
of
the
century
months
earlier
edward
henry
had
ordained
and
announced
that
the
regent
theatre
should
be
inaugurated
on
a
given
date
in
june
at
the
full
height
and
splendour
of
the
london
season
and
he
had
astounded
the
theatrical
world
by
adhering
through
thick
and
thin
to
that
date
and
had
thereby
intensified
his
reputation
as
an
eccentric
for
the
oldest
inhabitant
of
that
world
could
not
recall
a
case
in
which
the
opening
of
a
new
theatre
had
not
been
promised
for
at
least
three
widely
different
dates
edward
henry
had
now
arrived
at
the
eve
of
the
dread
date
and
if
he
had
arrived
there
in
comparative
safety
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
avoiding
complete
shame
and
disaster
he
felt
and
he
admitted
that
the
credit
was
due
as
much
to
alloyd
as
to
himself
which
only
confirmed
an
early
impression
of
his
that
architects
were
queer
people
rather
like
artists
and
poets
in
some
ways
but
with
a
basis
of
bricks
and
mortar
to
them
his
own
share
in
the
enterprise
of
the
regent
had
in
theory
been
confined
to
engaging
the
right
people
for
the
right
tasks
and
situations
and
to
signing
cheques
he
had
depended
chiefly
upon
marrier
who
growing
more
radiant
every
day
had
gradually
developed
into
a
sort
of
chubby
napoleon
taking
an
immense
delight
in
detail
and
in
choosing
minor
hands
at
salaries
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
marrier
refused
no
call
upon
his
energy
he
was
helping
carlo
trent
in
the
production
and
of
the
play
he
dried
the
tears
of
girlish
neophytes
at
rehearsals
he
helped
to
number
the
stalls
he
showed
a
passionate
interest
in
the
tessellated
pavement
of
the
entrance
he
taught
the
managerial
typewriting
girl
how
to
make
afternoon
tea
he
went
to
hitchin
to
find
a
mediaeval
chair
required
for
the
third
act
and
found
it
in
a
word
he
was
fully
equal
to
the
post
of
acting
manager
he
managed
he
managed
everything
and
everybody
except
edward
henry
and
except
the
a
functionary
whose
conviction
of
his
own
indispensability
and
importance
was
so
sincere
that
even
marrier
shared
it
and
left
him
alone
in
his
bismarckian
operations
the
who
sang
in
musical
comedy
chorus
at
night
knew
that
if
the
regent
theatre
succeeded
it
would
be
his
doing
and
his
alone
and
yet
edward
henry
though
he
had
delegated
everything
had
yet
found
a
vast
amount
of
work
to
do
and
was
thereby
exhausted
that
was
why
he
was
drumming
on
the
pane
that
was
why
he
was
conscious
of
a
foolish
desire
to
shove
his
fist
through
the
pane
during
the
afternoon
he
had
had
two
scenes
with
two
representatives
of
the
libraries
so
called
because
they
deal
in
and
not
in
books
who
had
declined
to
take
up
any
of
his
tickets
in
advance
he
had
commenced
an
action
against
a
firm
of
he
had
settled
an
incipient
strike
in
the
departments
originated
by
cosmo
clark
views
about
lighting
he
had
dictated
answers
to
letters
of
complaint
from
unknown
people
concerning
the
supply
of
free
seats
for
the
first
night
he
had
responded
in
the
negative
to
a
request
from
a
newspaper
critic
who
on
the
score
that
he
was
deaf
wanted
a
copy
of
the
play
he
had
replied
finally
to
an
official
of
the
county
council
about
the
over
the
stage
he
had
replied
finally
to
another
official
of
the
county
council
about
the
electric
sign
he
had
attended
to
a
new
curiosity
on
the
part
of
another
official
of
the
county
council
about
the
iron
curtain
but
he
had
been
almost
rude
to
still
another
official
of
the
county
council
about
the
wiring
of
the
electric
light
in
the
he
had
been
unmistakably
and
pleasurably
rude
in
writing
to
slossons
about
their
criticisms
of
the
lock
on
the
door
of
lord
woldo
private
entrance
to
the
theatre
also
he
had
arranged
with
the
representative
of
the
chief
commissioner
of
police
concerning
the
carriage
regulations
for
and
and
he
had
indeed
had
more
than
enough
his
nerves
though
he
did
not
know
it
and
would
have
scorned
the
imputation
were
slowly
giving
way
hence
really
the
danger
to
the
pane
through
the
pane
in
the
dying
light
he
could
see
a
of
shaftesbury
avenue
and
an
aged
leaning
against
a
and
displaying
a
poster
which
spoke
of
isabel
joy
isabel
joy
yet
again
that
little
fact
of
itself
contributed
to
his
exasperation
he
thought
considering
the
importance
of
the
regent
theatre
and
the
salary
he
was
paying
to
his
that
the
newspapers
ought
to
occupy
their
pages
solely
with
the
metropolitan
affairs
of
edward
henry
machin
but
the
wretched
isabel
had
as
it
were
got
london
by
the
throat
she
had
reached
chicago
from
the
west
on
her
triumphant
way
home
and
had
there
contrived
to
be
arrested
according
to
boast
but
she
was
experiencing
much
more
difficulty
in
emerging
from
the
chicago
prison
than
in
entering
it
and
the
question
was
now
becoming
acute
whether
the
emissary
of
the
militant
suffragettes
would
arrive
back
in
london
within
the
specified
period
of
a
hundred
days
naturally
london
was
holding
its
breath
london
will
keep
calm
during
moderate
crises
such
as
a
national
strike
or
the
agony
of
the
house
of
lords
but
when
the
supreme
excitation
is
achieved
london
knows
how
to
let
itself
go
if
you
please
machin
he
turned
it
was
his
typewriter
miss
lindop
a
young
girl
of
some
years
holding
a
but
i
had
my
tea
once
he
snapped
but
you
not
had
your
dinner
sir
and
it
eight
she
pleaded
he
had
known
this
girl
for
less
than
a
month
and
he
paid
her
fewer
shillings
a
week
than
the
years
of
her
age
and
yet
somehow
she
had
assumed
a
worshipping
charge
of
him
based
on
the
idea
that
he
was
incapable
of
taking
care
of
himself
to
look
at
her
appealing
eyes
one
might
have
thought
that
she
would
have
died
to
ensure
his
welfare
and
they
want
to
see
you
about
the
linoleum

timidly

man
says
it
must
be
taken
up
the
linoleum
for
the
gallery
stairs
something
snapped
in
him
he
almost
walked
right
through
the
young
woman
and
the
i
linoleum
them
he
bitterly
exclaimed
and
disappeared
ii
having
duly
linoleumed
them
or
rather
having
very
annoyingly
quite
failed
to
linoleum
them
edward
henry
continued
his
way
up
the
gallery
staircase
and
reached
the
auditorium
where
to
his
astonishment
a
good
deal
of
electricity
at
one
penny
three
farthings
a
unit
was
blazing
every
seat
in
the
narrow
and
gallery
where
at
the
sides
the
knees
of
one
spectator
would
be
on
a
level
with
the
of
the
spectator
in
the
row
beneath
had
a
perfect
and
entire
view
of
the
proscenium
opening
and
edward
henry
now
proved
this
unprecedented
fact
by
climbing
to
the
topmost
corner
seat
and
therefrom
surveying
the
scene
of
which
he
was
monarch
the
boxes
were
swathed
in
their
new
white
and
likewise
the
stalls
not
as
yet
screwed
down
to
the
floor
save
three
or
four
stalls
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
from
which
the
sheet
had
been
removed
on
one
of
these
seats
far
off
though
it
was
he
could
descry
a
paper
bag
probably
containing
sandwiches
and
on
another
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
several
alert
ladies
with
walked
uneasily
about
in
the
aisles
the
orchestra
was
hidden
in
the
well
provided
for
it
and
apparently
murmuring
in
its
sleep
the
magnificent
designed
by
saracen
givington
concealed
the
stage
suddenly
marrier
and
carlo
trent
appeared
through
the
iron
door
that
gave
communication
to
initiates
between
the
wings
and
the
auditorium
they
sat
down
in
the
stalls
and
the
curtain
rose
with
a
violent
swish
and
disclosed
the
first
set
of
the
orient
pearl
what
about
that
amber
cosmo
marrier
cried
thickly
after
a
pause
his
mouth
occupied
with
sandwich
there
you
are
came
the
reply
right
said
marrier
strike
do
strike
contradicted
carlo
trent
strike
i
tell
you
we
must
get
on
with
the
second
act
the
voices
resounded
queerly
in
the
empty
theatre
the
stage
was
invaded
by
before
the
curtain
could
descend
again
edward
henry
heard
a
tripping
step
behind
him
it
was
the
faithful
typewriting
girl
i
say
he
said
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
going
on
here
true
that
in
the
rush
of
more
important
business
i
almost
forgotten
that
a
theatre
is
a
place
where
they
perform
plays
it
the
machin
said
the
woman
startled
and
apologetic
but
the
was
fixed
for
three
said
he
it
must
have
been
finished
three
hours
ago
i
think
they
only
just
done
the
first
act
the
woman
breathed
i
know
they
did
begin
till
seven
oh
machin
of
course
no
affair
of
mine
but
i
worked
in
a
good
many
theatres
and
i
do
think
it
such
a
mistake
to
have
the
quite
private
if
you
get
a
hundred
or
so
people
in
the
stalls
then
it
an
audience
and
there
much
less
delay
and
everything
goes
much
better
but
when
it
private
a
is
just
like
any
other
rehearsal
only
more
so
perhaps
said
edward
henry
smiling
he
saw
that
he
had
made
her
happy
but
he
saw
also
that
he
had
given
her
empire
over
him
i
got
your
tea
here
she
said
rather
like
a
now
wo
you
drink
it
i
drink
it
if
it
not
stewed
he
muttered
oh
she
protested
of
course
it
is
i
poured
it
off
the
leaves
into
another
teapot
before
i
brought
it
up
she
went
behind
the
barrier
and
reappeared
balancing
a
cup
of
tea
with
a
slice
of
sultana
cake
edged
on
to
the
saucer
and
as
she
handed
it
to
him
the
sustenance
of
rehearsals
she
gazed
at
him
and
he
could
almost
hear
her
eyes
saying
you
poor
thing
there
was
nothing
that
he
hated
so
much
as
to
be
pitied
you
go
home
he
commanded
oh
but
you
go
home
see
he
paused
threatening
if
you
do
clear
out
on
the
tick
i
chuck
this
cup
and
saucer
down
into
the
stalls
horrified
she
vanished
he
sighed
his
relief
after
some
time
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
climbed
into
his
chair
and
the
orchestra
began
to
play
and
the
curtain
went
up
again
on
the
second
act
of
the
masterpiece
in
hexameters
the
new
scenery
which
edward
henry
had
with
extraordinary
courage
insisted
on
saracen
givington
substituting
for
the
original
incomprehensibilities
displayed
at
the
azure
society
performance
rather
pleased
him
its
colouring
was
agreeable
and
it
did
resemble
something
definite
you
could
though
perhaps
not
easily
tell
what
it
was
meant
to
represent
the
play
proceeded
and
the
general
effect
was
surprisingly
pleasant
to
edward
henry
and
then
rose
euclid
as
haidee
came
on
for
the
great
scene
of
the
act
from
the
distance
of
the
gallery
she
looked
quite
passably
youthful
and
beyond
question
she
had
a
dominating
presence
in
her
resplendent
costume
she
was
incomparably
and
amazingly
better
than
she
had
been
at
the
few
previous
rehearsals
which
edward
henry
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
witness
she
even
reminded
him
of
his
earliest
entrancing
vision
of
her
some
people
may
this
he
admitted
with
a
gleam
of
optimism
hitherto
for
weeks
past
he
had
gone
forward
with
his
preparations
in
the
most
frigid
and
convinced
pessimism
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
become
involved
in
a
vast
piece
of
machinery
and
that
nothing
short
of
blowing
the
theatre
up
with
dynamite
would
bring
the
cranks
and
pistons
to
a
stop
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
also
that
everything
was
unreal
that
the
contracts
he
signed
were
unreal
and
the
proofs
he
passed
and
the
posters
he
saw
on
the
walls
of
london
and
the
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
only
the
cheques
he
drew
had
the
air
of
being
real
and
now
in
a
magic
flash
after
a
few
moments
gazing
at
the
stage
he
saw
all
differently
he
scented
triumph
from
afar
off
as
one
sniffs
the
tang
of
the
sea
on
the
morrow
he
had
to
meet
nellie
at
euston
and
he
had
shrunk
from
meeting
her
with
her
terrible
remorseless
provincial
untheatrical
common
sense
but
now
in
another
magic
flash
he
envisaged
the
meeting
with
a
of
hope
strange
he
admitted
it
was
strange
and
then
he
failed
to
hear
several
words
spoken
by
rose
euclid
and
then
a
few
more
as
the
emotion
of
the
scene
grew
the
proportion
of
her
words
audible
in
the
gallery
diminished
until
she
became
for
him
totally
inarticulate
raving
away
there
and
struggling
in
a
cocoon
of
hexameters
despair
seized
him
his
nervous
system
every
separate
nerve
of
it
was
on
the
rack
once
more
he
stood
up
in
a
sort
of
paroxysm
and
called
loudly
across
the
vast
intervening
space
speak
more
distinctly
please
a
fearful
silence
fell
upon
the
whole
theatre
the
rehearsal
stopped
the
building
itself
seemed
to
be
staggered
somebody
had
actually
demanded
that
words
should
be
uttered
articulately
marrier
turned
towards
the
intruder
as
one
determined
to
put
an
end
to
such
singularities
who
up
theyah
i
am
said
edward
henry
and
i
want
it
to
be
clearly
understood
in
my
theatre
that
the
first
thing
an
actor
has
to
do
is
to
make
himself
heard
i
daresay
i
devilish
odd
but
that
how
i
look
at
it
whom
do
you
mean
mr
machin
asked
marrier
in
a
different
tone
i
mean
miss
euclid
of
course
here
i
spent
heaven
knows
how
much
on
the
acoustics
of
this
theatre
and
i
ca
make
out
a
word
she
says
i
can
hear
all
the
others
and
this
is
the
you
must
remember
you
in
the
gallery
said
marrier
firmly
and
what
if
i
am
i
not
giving
gallery
seats
away
night
it
true
i
giving
half
the
stalls
away
but
the
gallery
will
be
paid
for
another
silence
said
rose
euclid
sharply
and
edward
henry
caught
every
word
with
the
most
perfect
distinctness
i
sick
and
tired
of
people
saying
they
ca
make
out
what
i
say
they
actually
write
me
letters
about
it
why
people
make
out
what
i
say
she
quitted
the
stage
another
silence
ring
down
the
curtain
said
marrier
in
a
thrilled
voice
iii
shortly
afterwards
marrier
came
into
the
managerial
office
lit
up
now
where
edward
henry
was
dictating
to
his
typewriter
and
who
having
been
caught
in
hat
and
jacket
on
the
threshold
had
been
brought
back
and
was
tapping
his
words
direct
on
to
the
machine
it
was
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
sole
proprietor
of
the
regent
theatre
was
now
in
high
spirits
and
good
humour
well
marrier
my
boy
he
saluted
the
how
are
you
getting
on
with
that
rehearsal
well
sir
said
marrier
i
not
getting
on
with
it
miss
euclid
refuses
absolutely
to
proceed
she
in
her
but
why
inquired
edward
henry
with
bland
surprise
does
she
to
be
heard
by
her
marrier
showed
an
enfeebled
smile
she
has
been
spoken
to
like
that
for
thirty
years
said
he
but
do
you
agree
with
me
asked
edward
henry
yes
said
marrier
i
with
you
and
does
your
friend
carlo
want
his
precious
hexameters
to
be
heard
we
baoth
agree
with
you
said
marrier
the
fact
is
we
done
all
we
could
but
it
no
use
she
splendid
only
he
paused
only
you
ca
make
out
ten
per
cent
of
what
she
says
edward
henry
finished
for
him
well
i
got
no
use
for
that
in
my
theatre
he
found
a
singular
pleasure
in
emphasizing
the
phrase
my
theatre
that
all
very
well
said
marrier
but
what
are
you
going
to
about
it
i
tried
everything
come
in
and
burst
up
the
entire
show
if
you
forgive
my
saying
saoh
do
exclaimed
edward
henry
it
perfectly
simple
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
act
god
bless
my
soul
are
you
getting
fifteen
pounds
a
week
and
are
you
my
act
then
you
done
enough
hinting
you
proved
that
hints
are
no
good
you
have
known
that
from
your
birth
up
marrier
if
you
been
born
in
the
five
towns
act
my
boy
but
haow
if
she
wo
go
on
she
wo
is
her
understudy
in
the
theatre
yes
it
miss
cunningham
you
know
what
salary
does
she
get
ten
pounds
a
week
what
for
well
partly
to
understudy
i
suppose
let
her
earn
it
then
go
on
with
the
rehearsal
and
let
her
play
the
part
night
she
be
delighted
you
bet
but
miss
lindop
edward
henry
interrupted
will
you
please
read
to
marrier
what
i
dictated
he
turned
to
marrier
it
an
interview
with
myself
for
one
of
papers
miss
lindop
with
tears
in
her
voice
if
not
in
her
eyes
obeyed
the
order
and
drawing
the
paper
from
the
machine
read
its
contents
aloud
marrier
started
back
not
in
the
figurative
but
in
the
literal
sense
as
he
listened
but
you
never
send
that
out
he
exclaimed
why
not
no
paper
will
print
it
my
dear
marrier
said
edward
henry
do
be
a
simpleton
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
papers
will
be
delighted
to
print
it
and
all
the
rest
will
copy
the
one
that
does
print
it
be
the
talk
of
london
and
isabel
joy
will
be
absolutely
snuffed
out
well
said
marrier
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
pity
you
did
then
marrier
moved
away
i
say
he
murmured
at
the
door
do
you
think
you
ought
to
read
that
to
rose
first
i
read
it
to
rose
like
a
bird
said
edward
henry
within
two
minutes
it
was
impossible
to
get
from
his
room
to
the
in
less
he
was
knocking
at
rose
euclid
door
there
said
a
voice
he
entered
and
then
replied
i
am
rose
euclid
was
smoking
a
cigarette
and
scratching
the
arm
of
an
behind
her
her
maid
stood
near
by
with
a
sorry
you
ca
go
on
with
the
rehearsal
miss
euclid
said
edward
henry
very
quickly
however
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
but
marrier
thought
you
like
to
hear
this
it
part
of
an
interview
with
me
that
going
to
appear
in
the
press
without
pausing
he
went
on
to
read
i
found
alderman
machin
the
hero
of
the
five
towns
and
the
proprietor
and
initiator
of
newest
and
most
and
most
intellectual
theatre
surrounded
by
a
complicated
apparatus
of
telephones
and
typewriters
in
his
managerial
room
at
the
regent
he
received
me
very
courteously
yes
he
said
in
response
to
my
question
the
rumour
is
quite
true
the
principal
part
in
orient
pearl
will
be
played
on
the
first
night
by
miss
euclid
understudy
miss
olga
cunningham
a
young
woman
of
very
remarkable
talent
no
miss
euclid
is
not
ill
or
even
indisposed
but
she
and
i
have
had
a
grave
difference
of
opinion
the
point
between
us
was
whether
miss
euclid
speeches
ought
to
be
clearly
audible
in
the
auditorium
i
considered
they
ought
i
may
be
wrong
i
may
be
provincial
but
that
was
and
is
my
view
at
the
seated
in
the
gallery
i
could
not
hear
her
lines
i
objected
she
refused
to
consider
the
objection
or
to
proceed
with
the
rehearsal
illae
not
at
all
said
machin
in
reply
to
a
question
i
have
the
highest
admiration
for
miss
euclid
genius
i
should
not
presume
to
dictate
to
her
as
to
her
art
she
has
had
a
very
long
experience
of
the
stage
very
long
and
doubtless
knows
better
than
i
do
only
the
regent
happens
to
be
my
theatre
and
i
responsible
for
it
every
member
of
the
audience
will
have
a
complete
uninterrupted
view
of
the
stage
and
i
intend
that
every
member
of
the
audience
shall
hear
every
word
that
is
uttered
on
the
stage
i
odd
i
know
but
then
i
a
reputation
for
oddness
to
keep
up
and
by
the
way
i
sure
that
miss
cunningham
will
make
a
great
reputation
for
herself
not
while
i
here
she
wo
exclaimed
rose
euclid
standing
up
and
enunciating
her
words
with
marvellous
clearness
edward
henry
glanced
at
her
and
then
continued
to
read
suggestions
for
headlines
quarrel
between
manager
and
situation
at
the
regent
theatre
machin
said
rose
euclid
you
are
not
a
gentleman
you
hardly
think
so
would
you
mused
edward
henry
as
if
mildly
interested
in
this
new
discovery
of
miss
euclid
maria
said
the
star
to
her
maid
go
and
tell
marrier
coming
and
i
go
back
to
the
gallery
said
edward
henry
it
the
place
for
people
like
me
is
it
i
daresay
i
tear
up
this
paper
later
miss
euclid
we
see
iv
on
the
next
night
a
male
figure
in
evening
dress
and
a
pale
overcoat
might
have
been
seen
standing
at
the
corner
of
piccadilly
circus
and
lower
regent
street
staring
at
an
electric
sign
in
the
shape
of
a
shield
which
said
in
its
glittering
throbbing
speech
of
incandescence
the
regent
rose
euclid
in
the
orient
pearl
the
figure
crossed
the
circus
and
stared
at
the
sign
from
a
new
point
of
view
then
it
passed
along
coventry
street
and
stared
at
the
sign
from
yet
another
point
of
view
then
it
reached
shaftesbury
avenue
and
stared
again
then
it
returned
to
its
original
station
it
was
the
figure
of
edward
henry
machin
savouring
the
glorious
electric
sign
of
which
he
had
dreamed
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
thought
of
seven
sachs
gazing
at
the
name
of
seven
sachs
in
fire
on
the
façade
of
a
broadway
theatre
in
new
york
was
not
this
london
phenomenon
at
least
as
fine
he
considered
it
was
the
regent
theatre
existed
there
it
stood
what
a
name
for
a
theatre
its
windows
were
all
illuminated
its
bathed
the
pavement
in
light
and
in
this
radiance
stood
the
commissionaires
in
their
military
pride
and
their
new
uniforms
a
line
of
waiting
automobiles
began
a
couple
of
yards
to
the
north
of
the
main
doors
and
continued
round
all
sorts
of
dark
corners
and
up
all
manner
of
back
streets
towards
golden
square
itself
marrier
had
had
the
automobiles
counted
and
had
told
him
the
number
but
such
was
edward
henry
condition
that
he
had
forgotten
a
row
of
boards
reared
on
the
pavement
against
the
walls
of
the
façade
said
stalls
full
private
boxes
full
dress
circle
full
upper
circle
full
pit
full
gallery
full
and
attached
to
the
ironwork
of
the
glazed
entrance
canopy
was
a
long
board
which
gave
the
same
information
in
terser
form
house
full
the
regent
had
indeed
been
obliged
to
refuse
quite
a
lot
of
money
on
its
opening
night
after
all
the
inauguration
of
a
new
theatre
was
something
even
in
london
important
personages
had
actually
begged
the
privilege
of
buying
seats
at
normal
prices
and
had
been
refused
unimportant
personages
such
as
those
whose
boast
in
the
universe
was
that
they
had
never
missed
a
first
night
in
the
west
end
for
twenty
thirty
or
even
fifty
years
had
tried
to
buy
seats
at
abnormal
prices
and
had
failed
which
was
in
itself
a
tragedy
edward
henry
at
the
final
moment
had
yielded
his
wife
stall
to
the
instances
of
a
minister
of
the
crown
and
at
lady
woldo
urgent
request
had
put
her
into
lady
private
where
also
was
miss
elsie
april
who
had
already
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
mrs
machin
edward
henry
first
night
was
an
event
of
magnitude
and
he
alone
was
responsible
for
it
his
volition
alone
had
brought
into
being
that
grand
edifice
whose
light
yellow
walls
now
gleamed
in
nocturnal
mystery
under
the
shimmer
of
countless
electric
bulbs
there
goes
pretty
nigh
forty
thousand
pounds
of
my
money
he
reflected
excitedly
and
he
reflected
after
all
i
somebody
then
he
glanced
down
lower
regent
street
and
saw
sir
john
much
larger
theatre
now
to
a
tenant
who
was
also
lavish
with
displays
of
radiance
and
he
reflected
that
on
first
nights
sir
john
pilgrim
in
addition
to
doing
all
that
he
himself
had
done
would
hold
the
great
on
the
stage
throughout
the
evening
and
he
admired
the
astounding
dazzling
energy
of
such
a
being
and
admitted
ungrudgingly
he
somebody
too
i
wonder
what
part
of
the
world
he
illuminating
just
now
edward
henry
did
not
deny
to
his
soul
that
he
was
extremely
nervous
he
would
not
and
could
not
face
even
the
bare
possibility
that
the
first
play
presented
at
the
new
theatre
might
be
a
failure
he
had
meant
to
witness
the
production
incognito
among
the
crowd
in
the
pit
or
in
the
gallery
but
after
visiting
the
pit
a
few
moments
before
the
curtain
went
up
he
had
been
appalled
by
the
levity
of
the
pit
remarks
on
things
in
general
the
pit
did
not
seem
to
be
in
any
way
chastened
or
softened
by
the
fact
that
a
fortune
that
reputations
that
careers
were
at
stake
he
had
fled
from
the
packed
pit
as
for
the
gallery
he
decided
that
he
had
already
had
enough
of
the
gallery
he
had
wandered
about
corridors
and
to
and
fro
in
his
own
room
and
in
the
wings
and
even
in
the
basement
as
nervous
as
a
lost
cat
or
an
author
and
as
as
a
criminal
who
knows
himself
to
be
on
the
edge
of
discovery
it
was
a
fact
that
he
could
not
look
people
in
the
eyes
the
reception
of
the
first
act
had
been
fairly
amiable
and
he
had
suffered
horribly
as
he
listened
for
the
applause
catching
sight
of
carlo
trent
in
the
distance
of
a
passage
he
had
positively
run
away
from
carlo
trent
the
first
had
seemed
to
last
for
about
three
months
its
nightmarish
length
had
driven
him
almost
to
lunacy
the
feel
of
the
second
act
so
far
as
it
mystically
communicated
itself
to
him
in
his
place
of
concealment
had
been
better
and
at
the
second
fall
of
the
curtain
the
applause
had
been
enthusiastic
yes
enthusiastic
curiously
it
was
the
revulsion
caused
by
this
new
birth
of
hope
that
while
the
third
act
was
being
played
had
driven
him
out
of
the
theatre
his
wild
hope
needed
ozone
his
breast
had
to
expand
in
the
boundless
prairie
of
piccadilly
circus
his
legs
had
to
walk
his
arms
had
to
swing
now
he
crossed
the
circus
again
to
his
own
pavement
and
gazed
like
a
stranger
at
his
own
posters
on
several
of
them
encircled
in
a
scarlet
ring
was
the
sole
name
of
rose
euclid
impressive
and
smaller
but
above
it
the
legend
machin
sole
proprietor
he
asked
himself
impartially
as
his
eyes
uneasily
left
the
poster
and
slipped
round
the
circus
deserted
save
by
a
few
sinister
and
idle
figures
at
that
hour
should
i
have
sent
that
interview
to
the
papers
or
should
i
i
wonder
i
expect
some
folks
would
say
that
on
the
whole
i
been
rather
hard
on
rose
since
i
first
met
her
anyhow
she
speaking
up
all
right
he
laughed
shortly
a
newsboy
floated
up
from
the
circus
bearing
a
poster
with
the
name
of
isabel
joy
on
it
in
large
letters
he
thought
be
blowed
to
isabel
joy
he
did
not
care
a
fig
for
isabel
joy
competition
now
and
then
a
small
door
opened
in
the
wall
close
by
and
an
elegant
cloaked
woman
came
out
on
to
the
pavement
the
door
was
the
private
door
leading
to
the
private
box
of
lord
woldo
owner
of
the
ground
upon
which
the
regent
theatre
was
built
the
woman
he
recognized
with
confusion
as
elsie
april
whom
he
had
not
seen
alone
since
the
azure
society
night
what
are
you
doing
out
here
mr
machin
she
greeted
him
with
pleasant
composure
i
thinking
said
he
it
going
splendidly
she
remarked
really
i
just
running
round
to
the
to
meet
dear
rose
as
she
comes
off
what
a
delightful
woman
your
wife
is
so
pretty
and
so
sensible
she
disappeared
round
the
corner
before
he
could
compose
a
suitable
husband
reply
to
this
laudation
of
a
wife
then
the
commissionaires
at
the
entrance
seemed
to
start
into
life
and
then
suddenly
several
preoccupied
men
strode
rapidly
out
of
the
theatre
buttoning
their
coats
and
vanished
critics
on
their
way
to
destruction
the
performance
must
be
finishing
hastily
he
followed
in
the
direction
taken
by
elsie
april
v
he
was
in
the
wings
on
the
prompt
side
close
by
stood
the
prompter
an
untidy
youth
with
imperfections
of
teeth
clutching
hard
at
the
manuscript
of
the
orient
pearl
sundry
players
of
varying
stellar
degrees
were
posed
around
in
the
opulent
costumes
designed
by
saracen
givington
miss
lindop
was
in
the
background
ecstatically
happy
her
cheeks
a
of
tears
afar
off
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
alone
stood
rose
euclid
gorgeous
in
green
and
silver
bowing
and
bowing
and
bowing
bowing
before
the
storm
of
approval
and
acclamation
that
swept
from
the
auditorium
across
the
footlights
with
a
sound
like
that
of
tearing
silk
or
of
a
gigantic
contralto
mosquito
the
curtain
swished
down
and
swished
up
and
swished
down
again
bouquets
flew
on
to
the
stage
from
the
auditorium
a
custom
newly
imported
from
the
united
states
by
miss
euclid
and
encouraged
by
her
though
contrary
to
the
lofty
canons
of
london
taste
the
actress
already
held
one
huge
trophy
shaped
as
a
crown
to
her
breast
she
hesitated
and
then
ran
to
the
wings
and
caught
edward
henry
by
the
wrist
impulsively
madly
they
shook
hands
in
an
ecstasy
it
was
as
though
they
recognized
in
one
another
a
fundamental
and
glorious
worth
it
was
as
though
no
words
could
ever
express
the
depth
of
appreciation
affection
and
admiration
which
each
intensely
felt
for
the
other
it
was
as
though
this
moment
were
the
final
consecration
of
whose
long
loyal
comradeship
had
never
been
clouded
by
the
faintest
breath
of
mutual
suspicion
rose
euclid
was
still
the
unparalleled
star
the
image
of
grace
and
beauty
and
dominance
upon
the
stage
and
yet
quite
clearly
edward
henry
saw
close
to
his
the
wrinkled
damaged
daubed
face
and
thin
neck
of
an
old
woman
and
it
made
no
difference
rose
cried
a
strained
voice
and
rose
euclid
wrenched
herself
from
him
and
tumbled
with
half
a
sob
into
the
clasping
arms
of
elsie
april
you
saved
the
intellectual
theatah
for
london
my
boy
that
what
you
done
marrier
now
was
gripping
his
hand
and
edward
henry
was
convinced
that
he
had
the
strident
vigour
of
the
applause
showed
no
diminution
and
through
the
thick
heavy
rain
of
it
could
be
heard
the
monotonous
insistent
detonations
of
one
syllable
and
then
another
syllable
was
added
speech
speech
speech
speech
mechanically
edward
henry
lit
a
cigarette
he
had
no
consciousness
of
doing
so
where
is
trent
people
were
asking
carlo
trent
appeared
up
a
staircase
at
the
back
of
the
stage
you
got
to
go
on
said
marrier
now
pull
yourself
together
the
great
beast
is
calling
for
you
say
a
few
wahds
carlo
trent
in
his
turn
seized
the
hand
of
edward
henry
and
it
was
for
all
the
world
as
though
he
were
seizing
the
hand
of
an
intellectual
and
poetic
equal
and
wrung
it
come
now
marrier
beaming
admonished
him
and
then
pushed
what
must
i
say
stammered
carlo
whatever
comes
into
your
head
all
right
i
say
something
a
man
in
a
dirty
white
apron
drew
back
the
heavy
mass
of
the
curtain
about
eighteen
inches
and
carlo
trent
stepping
forward
the
glare
of
the
footlights
suddenly
lit
his
white
face
the
applause
now
multiplied
fivefold
and
become
deafening
seemed
to
beat
him
back
against
the
curtain
his
lips
worked
he
did
not
bow
cam
back
you
fool
whispered
marrier
and
carlo
trent
stepped
back
into
safe
shelter
why
did
you
say
something
i
murmured
weakly
the
greatest
dramatic
poet
in
the
world
and
began
to
cry
speech
speech
speech
speech
here
said
edward
henry
gruffly
get
out
of
my
way
i
settle
get
out
of
my
way
and
he
riddled
carlo
trent
with
a
fusillade
of
savagely
scornful
glances
the
man
in
the
apron
obediently
drew
back
the
curtain
again
and
the
next
second
edward
henry
was
facing
an
auditorium
crowded
with
his
patrons
everybody
was
standing
up
chiefly
in
the
aisles
and
crowded
at
the
entrances
and
quite
half
the
people
were
waving
and
quite
a
quarter
of
them
were
shouting
he
bowed
several
times
an
age
elapsed
his
ears
were
stunned
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
brain
was
working
with
marvellous
perfection
he
perceived
that
he
had
been
utterly
wrong
about
the
orient
pearl
and
that
all
his
advisers
had
been
splendidly
right
he
had
failed
to
catch
its
charm
and
to
feel
its
power
but
this
audience
this
magnificent
representative
audience
drawn
from
london
in
the
brilliant
height
of
the
season
had
not
failed
it
occurred
to
him
to
raise
his
hand
and
as
he
raised
his
hand
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
hand
held
a
lighted
cigarette
a
magic
hush
fell
upon
the
magnificent
audience
which
owned
all
that
endless
line
of
automobiles
outside
edward
henry
in
the
hush
took
a
pull
at
his
cigarette
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
pitching
his
voice
well
for
municipal
politics
had
made
him
a
practised
public
speaker
i
congratulate
you
this
evening
you
have
succeeded
there
was
a
roar
confused
mirthful
humorously
protesting
he
distinctly
heard
a
man
in
the
front
row
of
the
stalls
say
well
for
sheer
nerve
and
then
go
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
he
smiled
and
retired
marrier
took
charge
of
him
you
merit
the
entire
confectioner
shop
exclaimed
marrier
aghast
admiring
triumphant
now
edward
henry
had
had
no
intention
of
meriting
cake
he
had
merely
followed
in
speech
the
secret
train
of
his
thought
but
he
saw
that
he
had
treated
a
west
end
audience
as
a
west
end
audience
had
never
before
been
treated
and
that
his
audacity
had
conquered
hence
he
determined
not
to
refuse
the
cake
did
i
tell
you
i
settle
said
he
the
band
played
god
save
the
king
vi
one
hour
later
in
the
chamber
at
the
majestic
as
his
wife
lay
in
bed
and
he
was
methodically
folding
up
a
creased
white
tie
and
inspecting
his
chin
in
the
mirror
he
felt
that
he
was
touching
again
after
an
immeasurable
interval
the
of
reality
nellie
even
when
he
could
only
see
her
face
and
that
in
a
mirror
was
the
most
real
phenomenon
in
his
existence
and
she
possessed
the
strange
faculty
of
dispelling
all
unreality
round
about
her
well
he
said
how
did
you
get
on
in
the
box
oh
she
replied
i
got
on
very
well
with
the
woldo
woman
she
one
of
our
sort
but
i
not
set
up
with
your
elsie
april
dash
this
collar
nellie
continued
and
i
can
tell
you
another
thing
i
do
envy
rollo
wrissell
what
wrissell
got
to
do
with
it
she
means
to
marry
him
elsie
april
means
to
marry
wrissell
he
was
in
and
out
of
the
box
all
night
it
was
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
what
amiss
with
my
elsie
april
edward
henry
demanded
she
a
thought
too
for
my
taste
answered
nellie
astonishing
how
pleasantness
is
regarded
with
suspicion
in
the
five
towns
even
by
women
who
can
at
a
pinch
be
angels
vii
often
during
the
brief
night
he
gazed
sleepily
at
the
vague
next
bed
and
mused
upon
the
extraordinariness
of
women
consciences
his
wife
slept
like
an
innocent
she
always
did
it
was
as
though
she
gently
expired
every
evening
and
returned
gloriously
to
life
every
morning
the
sunshiny
hours
between
three
and
seven
were
very
long
to
him
but
it
was
indisputable
that
he
did
not
hear
the
clock
strike
six
which
was
at
any
rate
proof
of
a
little
sleep
to
the
good
at
five
minutes
past
seven
he
thought
he
heard
a
faint
rustling
noise
in
the
corridor
and
he
arose
and
tiptoed
to
the
door
and
opened
it
yes
the
majestic
had
its
good
qualities
he
had
ordered
that
all
the
london
morning
daily
papers
should
be
laid
at
his
door
as
early
as
possible
and
there
the
pile
was
somewhat
damp
and
as
fresh
as
fruit
with
a
slight
odour
of
ink
he
took
it
in
his
heart
was
beating
as
he
climbed
back
into
bed
with
it
and
arranged
pillows
so
that
he
could
sit
up
and
unfolded
the
first
paper
nellie
had
not
stirred
once
again
he
was
disappointed
in
the
prominence
given
by
the
powerful
london
press
to
his
london
enterprise
in
the
first
newspaper
a
very
important
one
he
positively
could
not
find
any
criticism
of
the
regent
first
night
there
was
nearly
a
page
of
the
offensive
isabel
joy
who
was
now
appealing
through
the
newspapers
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
isabel
had
been
christened
the
and
the
special
correspondents
of
the
entire
earth
were
gathered
about
her
carpeted
cell
hope
still
remained
that
she
would
reach
london
within
the
hundred
days
an
unknown
adherent
of
the
cause
for
which
she
suffered
had
promised
to
give
ten
thousand
pounds
to
that
cause
if
she
did
so
further
she
was
receiving
over
sixty
proposals
of
marriage
a
day
and
so
on
and
so
on
most
of
this
he
gathered
in
an
instant
from
the
headlines
alone
nauseating
another
annoying
item
in
the
paper
was
a
column
and
a
half
given
to
the
of
the
first
new
thought
church
in
dean
street
soho
about
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
its
original
site
he
hated
the
first
new
thought
church
as
one
always
hates
that
to
which
one
has
done
an
injury
then
he
found
what
he
was
searching
for
regent
theatre
production
of
poetical
drama
at
london
latest
playhouse
after
all
it
was
well
situated
in
the
paper
on
quite
an
important
page
and
there
was
over
a
column
of
it
but
in
his
nervous
excitation
his
eyes
had
missed
it
his
eyes
now
read
it
over
half
of
it
was
given
up
to
a
discussion
of
the
don
juan
legend
and
the
significance
of
the
byronic
character
of
haidee
obviously
written
before
the
performance
a
description
of
the
plot
occupied
most
of
the
rest
and
a
reference
to
the
acting
ended
it
miss
rose
euclid
in
the
trying
and
occasionally
beautiful
part
of
haidee
was
all
that
her
admirers
could
have
wished
miss
cunningham
distinguished
herself
by
her
diction
and
bearing
in
the
small
part
of
the
messenger
the
final
words
were
the
reception
was
quite
favourable
quite
favourable
indeed
edward
henry
had
a
chill
good
heavens
was
not
the
reception
ecstatically
madly
foolishly
enthusiastic
why
he
exclaimed
within
i
never
saw
such
a
reception
it
was
true
but
then
he
had
never
seen
any
other
first
night
he
was
shocked
as
well
as
chilled
and
for
this
reason
for
weeks
past
all
the
newspapers
in
their
dramatic
gossip
had
contained
highly
sympathetic
references
to
his
enterprise
according
to
the
paragraphs
he
was
a
wondrous
man
and
the
theatre
was
a
wondrous
house
the
best
of
all
possible
theatres
and
carlo
trent
was
a
great
writer
and
rose
euclid
exactly
as
marvellous
as
she
had
been
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
and
the
prospects
of
the
drama
in
london
so
favourable
as
to
amount
to
a
certainty
of
success
in
those
columns
of
dramatic
gossip
there
was
no
flaw
in
the
theatrical
world
in
those
columns
of
dramatic
gossip
no
piece
ever
failed
though
sometimes
a
piece
was
withdrawn
regretfully
and
against
the
wishes
of
the
public
to
make
room
for
another
piece
in
those
columns
of
dramatic
gossip
theatrical
managers
actors
and
especially
actresses
and
even
authors
were
benefactors
of
society
and
therefore
they
were
treated
with
the
deference
the
gentleness
the
heartfelt
sympathy
which
benefactors
of
society
merit
and
ought
to
receive
the
tone
of
the
criticism
of
the
first
night
was
different
it
was
subtly
not
crudely
different
but
different
it
was
the
next
newspaper
said
the
play
was
bad
and
the
audience
indulgent
it
was
very
severe
on
carlo
trent
and
very
kind
to
the
players
whom
it
regarded
as
good
men
and
women
in
adversity
with
particular
laudations
for
miss
rose
euclid
and
the
messenger
the
next
newspaper
said
the
play
was
a
masterpiece
and
would
be
so
hailed
in
any
country
but
england
england
however
unfortunately
this
was
a
newspaper
whose
political
opinions
edward
henry
despised
the
next
newspaper
praised
everything
and
everybody
and
called
the
reception
tumultuously
enthusiastic
and
edward
henry
felt
as
though
somebody
mistaking
his
face
for
a
slice
of
toast
had
spread
butter
all
over
it
even
the
paper
parting
assurance
that
the
future
of
the
higher
drama
in
london
was
now
safe
beyond
question
did
not
remove
this
delusion
of
butter
the
two
following
newspapers
were
more
sketchy
or
descriptive
and
referred
at
some
length
to
edward
henry
own
speech
with
a
kind
of
that
edward
henry
had
better
mind
what
he
was
about
three
illustrated
papers
and
photographs
of
scenes
and
figures
but
nothing
important
in
the
matter
of
criticism
the
rest
were
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
as
they
say
in
the
five
towns
on
the
whole
an
inscrutable
press
a
disconcerting
a
startling
an
but
not
a
hopeless
press
the
general
impression
which
he
gathered
from
his
perusals
was
that
the
author
was
a
pretentious
dullard
an
absolute
criminal
a
genius
that
the
actors
and
actresses
were
all
splendid
and
worked
hard
though
conceivably
one
or
two
of
them
had
been
set
impossible
tasks
to
wit
tasks
unsuited
to
their
personalities
that
he
himself
was
a
napoleon
a
temerarious
individual
an
incomprehensible
fellow
and
that
the
future
of
the
drama
in
london
was
not
a
topic
of
burning
actuality
he
remembered
sadly
the
descriptions
in
those
same
newspapers
of
the
theatre
itself
a
week
or
two
back
the
unique
theatre
in
which
the
occupant
of
every
seat
had
a
complete
and
uninterrupted
view
of
the
whole
of
the
proscenium
opening
surely
that
fact
alone
ought
to
have
ensured
proper
treatment
for
him
then
nellie
woke
up
and
saw
the
scattered
newspapers
well
she
asked
what
do
they
say
oh
he
replied
lightly
with
a
laugh
just
about
what
expect
of
course
you
know
what
a
audience
always
is
too
generous
and
ours
was
particularly
miss
april
saw
to
that
she
had
the
azure
society
behind
her
and
she
was
determined
to
help
rose
euclid
however
i
should
say
it
was
all
right
i
should
say
it
was
quite
all
right
i
told
you
it
was
a
gamble
you
know
when
nellie
dressing
said
that
she
considered
she
ought
to
go
back
home
that
day
he
offered
no
objection
indeed
he
rather
wanted
her
to
go
not
that
he
had
a
desire
to
spend
the
whole
of
his
time
at
the
theatre
unhampered
by
provincial
women
in
london
on
the
contrary
he
was
aware
of
a
most
definite
desire
not
to
go
to
the
theatre
he
lay
in
bed
and
watched
with
careless
curiosity
the
rapid
processes
of
nellie
toilette
he
had
his
breakfast
on
the
for
he
was
not
at
wilkins
neither
at
the
grand
babylon
then
he
helped
her
to
pack
and
finally
he
accompanied
her
to
euston
where
she
kissed
him
with
affectionate
common
sense
and
caught
the
twelve
five
he
was
relieved
that
nobody
from
the
five
towns
happened
to
be
going
down
by
that
train
as
he
turned
away
from
the
moving
carriage
the
evening
papers
had
just
arrived
at
the
bookstalls
he
bought
the
four
chief
organs
one
green
one
yellowish
one
white
one
pink
and
scanned
them
on
the
platform
the
white
organ
had
a
good
heading
of
the
intellectual
drama
in
london
what
a
provincial
has
done
opinions
of
leading
men
two
columns
altogether
there
was
however
little
in
the
two
columns
the
leading
men
had
practised
a
sagacious
caution
they
like
the
press
as
a
whole
were
obviously
waiting
to
see
which
way
the
great
elephantine
public
would
jump
when
the
enormous
animal
had
jumped
they
would
all
exclaim
what
did
i
tell
you
the
other
critiques
were
colourless
at
the
end
of
the
green
critique
occurred
the
following
sentence
it
is
only
fair
to
state
nevertheless
that
the
play
was
favourably
received
by
an
apparently
enthusiastic
audience
nevertheless
apparently
edward
henry
turned
the
page
to
the
theatrical
advertisements
regent
theatre
twenty
yards
from
piccadilly
circus
orient
pearl
by
carlo
trent
miss
rose
euclid
every
evening
at
matinées
every
wednesday
and
saturday
at
open
to
sole
proprietor
machin
unreal
fantastic
was
this
he
edward
henry
could
it
be
his
son
still
matinées
every
wednesday
and
saturday
wednesday
and
saturday
that
word
implied
and
necessitated
a
long
run
anyhow
a
run
extending
over
months
that
word
comforted
him
though
he
knew
as
well
as
you
do
that
marrier
had
composed
the
advertisement
and
that
he
himself
was
paying
for
it
it
comforted
him
he
was
just
like
a
child
viii
i
say
cunningham
made
a
hit
marrier
almost
shouted
at
him
as
he
entered
the
managerial
room
at
the
regent
cunningham
who
cunningham
then
he
remembered
she
was
the
girl
who
played
the
messenger
she
had
only
three
words
to
say
and
to
say
them
over
and
over
again
and
she
had
made
a
hit
seen
the
notices
asked
marrier
yes
what
of
them
oh
well
marrier
drawled
what
would
you
expect
that
just
what
said
observed
edward
henry
you
did
did
you
marrier
exclaimed
as
if
extremely
interested
by
this
corroboration
of
his
views
carlo
trent
strolled
in
he
remarked
that
he
happened
to
be
just
passing
but
discussion
of
the
situation
was
not
carried
very
far
that
evening
the
house
was
nearly
full
except
the
pit
and
the
gallery
which
were
nearly
empty
applause
was
perfunctory
how
much
edward
henry
inquired
of
the
manager
when
figures
were
added
together
pounds
two
shillings
hem
of
course
said
marrier
in
the
height
of
the
london
season
with
so
many
besides
they
got
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
it
edward
henry
did
not
turn
pale
still
he
was
aware
that
it
cost
him
a
trifle
over
sixty
pounds
to
ring
the
curtain
up
at
every
performance
and
this
sum
took
no
account
of
expenses
of
production
nor
of
author
fees
the
sum
would
have
been
higher
but
he
was
calculating
as
rent
of
the
theatre
only
the
plus
six
per
cent
on
the
total
price
of
the
building
what
disgusted
him
was
the
duplicity
of
the
audience
and
he
said
to
himself
violently
i
was
right
all
the
time
and
i
knew
i
was
right
idiots
chumps
of
course
i
was
right
on
the
third
night
the
house
held
pounds
and
sixpence
naturally
said
marrier
in
this
hot
weathah
i
never
knew
such
a
hot
june
it
the
places
that
are
doing
us
in
the
eye
in
fact
i
heard
that
the
white
city
is
packed
they
simply
bank
their
money
quick
enough
it
was
on
that
day
that
edward
henry
paid
salaries
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
was
providing
half
london
with
a
livelihood
assistant
ditto
property
men
electricians
prompters
staff
general
staff
dressers
commissionaires
cleaners
actors
actresses
understudies
to
say
nothing
of
rose
euclid
at
a
purely
nominal
salary
of
a
hundred
pounds
a
week
the
tenants
of
the
bars
were
grumbling
but
happily
he
was
getting
money
from
them
the
following
day
was
saturday
it
rained
a
succession
of
thunderstorms
the
morning
and
the
evening
performances
produced
together
pounds
well
said
marrier
in
this
kind
of
weathah
you
ca
expect
people
to
come
out
can
you
besides
this
cursed
habit
which
conclusions
did
not
materially
modify
the
harsh
fact
that
edward
henry
was
losing
over
thirty
pounds
a
day
or
at
the
rate
of
over
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
he
spent
sunday
between
his
hotel
and
his
club
chiefly
in
reiterating
to
himself
that
monday
began
a
new
week
and
that
something
would
have
to
occur
on
monday
something
did
occur
carlo
trent
lounged
into
the
office
early
the
man
was
for
ever
being
drawn
to
the
theatre
as
by
an
invisible
but
powerful
elastic
cord
the
papers
had
a
worse
attack
than
ever
of
isabel
joy
for
she
had
been
convicted
of
transgression
in
a
chicago
court
of
law
but
a
tremendous
lawyer
from
louis
had
loomed
over
chicago
and
having
examined
the
documents
in
the
case
was
hopeful
of
getting
the
conviction
quashed
he
had
discovered
that
in
one
and
the
same
document
isabel
had
been
spelt
isobel
and
worse
illinois
had
been
deprived
by
a
careless
clerk
of
one
of
its
l
he
was
sure
that
by
proving
these
grave
irregularities
in
american
justice
he
could
win
an
appeal
edward
henry
glanced
up
suddenly
from
the
newspaper
he
had
been
inspired
i
say
trent
he
remarked
without
any
warning
or
preparation
you
not
looking
at
all
well
i
want
a
change
myself
i
a
good
mind
to
take
you
for
a
oh
grumbled
trent
i
ca
afford
can
said
edward
henry
and
i
should
dream
of
letting
it
cost
you
a
penny
i
not
a
philanthropist
but
i
know
as
well
as
anybody
that
it
will
pay
us
theatrical
managers
to
keep
you
in
health
you
not
going
to
take
the
play
off
trent
demanded
suspiciously
certainly
not
said
edward
henry
what
sort
of
a
well
what
price
the
atlantic
been
to
new
york
neither
have
i
let
go
just
for
the
trip
it
do
us
good
you
do
mean
it
murmured
the
greatest
dramatic
poet
who
had
never
voyaged
further
than
the
isle
of
wight
his
eyeglass
swung
to
and
fro
edward
henry
feigned
to
resent
this
remark
of
course
i
mean
it
do
you
take
me
for
a
blooming
he
rose
marrier
then
more
loudly
marrier
marrier
entered
do
you
know
anything
about
the
sailings
to
new
york
rather
said
marrier
beaming
after
all
he
was
a
most
precious
aid
we
may
be
able
to
arrange
for
a
production
in
new
york
said
edward
henry
to
carlo
mysteriously
marrier
gazed
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
puzzled
chapter
x
isabel
i
throughout
the
voyage
of
the
from
liverpool
to
new
york
edward
henry
in
common
with
some
two
thousand
other
people
on
board
had
the
sensation
of
being
hurried
he
who
in
a
cab
rides
late
to
an
important
appointment
arrives
with
muscles
fatigued
by
mentally
aiding
the
horse
to
move
the
vehicle
along
thus
were
edward
muscles
fatigued
and
the
muscles
of
many
others
but
just
as
much
more
so
as
the
was
bigger
than
a
cab
for
the
having
been
seriously
delayed
in
liverpool
by
men
who
were
most
ridiculously
striking
for
the
fantastic
remuneration
of
one
pound
a
week
was
engaged
on
the
business
of
making
new
records
and
every
passenger
was
personally
determined
that
she
should
therein
succeed
and
despite
very
bad
june
weather
towards
the
end
she
did
sail
past
the
battery
on
a
grand
monday
morning
with
a
new
record
to
her
credit
so
far
edward
henry
plan
was
not
miscarrying
but
he
had
a
very
great
deal
to
do
and
very
little
time
in
which
to
do
it
and
whereas
the
muscles
of
the
other
passengers
were
relaxed
as
the
ship
drew
to
her
berth
edward
henry
muscles
were
only
more
tensely
tightened
he
had
expected
to
see
mr
seven
sachs
on
the
quay
for
in
response
to
his
telegram
from
queenstown
the
illustrious
had
sent
him
an
agreeable
wireless
message
in
full
atlantic
the
which
had
inspired
edward
henry
to
obtain
news
by
marconi
both
from
london
and
new
york
at
much
expense
from
the
east
he
had
had
daily
information
of
the
dwindling
receipts
at
the
regent
theatre
and
from
the
west
daily
information
concerning
isabel
joy
he
had
not
however
expected
mr
seven
sachs
to
walk
into
the
an
hour
before
the
ship
touched
the
quay
nevertheless
this
was
what
mr
seven
sachs
did
by
the
exercise
of
those
mysterious
powers
wielded
by
the
influential
in
democratic
communities
and
what
are
you
doing
here
mr
seven
sachs
greeted
edward
henry
with
geniality
edward
henry
lowered
his
voice
i
throwing
good
money
after
bad
said
he
the
friendly
grip
of
mr
seven
sachs
hand
did
him
good
reassured
him
and
gave
him
courage
he
was
utterly
tired
of
the
voyage
and
also
of
the
poetical
society
of
carlo
trent
whose
passage
had
cost
him
thirty
pounds
considerable
boredom
and
some
during
the
final
days
and
nights
a
dramatic
poet
with
an
appetite
was
a
full
dose
for
edward
henry
but
a
dramatic
poet
who
lay
on
his
back
and
moaned
for
naught
but
and
dry
land
amounted
to
more
than
edward
henry
could
conveniently
swallow
he
directed
sachs
attention
to
the
anguished
and
debile
organism
which
had
once
been
carlo
trent
and
sachs
was
so
sympathetic
that
carlo
trent
began
to
adore
him
and
edward
henry
to
be
somewhat
disturbed
in
his
previous
estimate
of
sachs
common
sense
but
at
a
favourable
moment
sachs
breathed
humorously
into
edward
ear
the
question
what
have
you
brought
out
for
i
brought
him
out
to
lose
him
as
they
pushed
through
the
bustle
of
the
enormous
ship
and
descended
from
the
dizzy
eminence
of
her
by
lifts
and
ladders
down
to
the
level
of
the
windy
rock
of
new
york
edward
henry
said
now
i
want
you
to
understand
sachs
that
i
have
a
minute
to
spare
i
just
looked
in
for
lunch
going
on
to
chicago
she
is
at
chicago
is
she
demanded
edward
henry
aghast
i
thought
she
reached
new
york
who
isabel
joy
oh
isabel
in
new
york
sure
enough
she
right
here
they
say
she
have
to
catch
the
if
she
going
to
get
away
with
it
get
away
with
what
well
the
goods
the
precious
word
reminded
edward
henry
of
an
evening
at
wilkins
and
raised
his
spirits
even
higher
it
was
a
word
he
loved
and
i
got
to
catch
the
too
said
he
but
trent
does
know
and
let
me
tell
you
she
going
to
do
the
quickest
that
any
ship
ever
did
the
purser
assured
me
she
leave
at
noon
unless
the
world
comes
to
an
end
in
the
meantime
now
what
about
a
hotel
you
stay
with
me
naturally
but
edward
henry
protested
oh
yes
you
will
i
shall
be
delighted
but
i
must
look
after
trent
he
stay
with
me
too
naturally
i
live
at
the
stuyvesant
hotel
you
know
on
fifth
i
a
pretty
private
suite
there
i
shall
arrange
a
little
supper
for
my
automobile
is
here
is
it
possible
that
i
once
saved
your
life
and
have
forgotten
all
about
it
edward
henry
exclaimed
or
do
you
treat
everybody
like
this
we
like
to
look
after
our
friends
said
sachs
simply
in
the
terrific
confusion
of
the
quay
where
groups
of
passengers
were
mounted
like
over
hillocks
of
baggage
sachs
stood
continually
between
the
travellers
and
the
administrative
rigour
and
official
incredulity
of
a
proud
republic
and
in
the
minimum
of
time
the
fine
trunk
of
edward
henry
and
the
modest
packages
of
the
poet
were
on
the
roof
of
sachs
vast
car
the
three
men
were
inside
and
the
car
was
leaping
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
a
at
full
speed
over
the
cobbles
of
a
wide
mediaeval
street
quick
thought
edward
henry
i
have
a
minute
to
lose
his
prayer
reached
the
chauffeur
conversation
was
difficult
carlo
trent
groaned
presently
they
rolled
less
perilously
upon
asphalt
though
the
equipage
still
lurched
edward
henry
was
for
ever
bending
his
head
towards
the
window
aperture
in
order
to
glimpse
the
roofs
of
the
buildings
and
never
seeing
the
roofs
now
we
on
fifth
said
sachs
after
a
fearful
lurch
with
pride
vistas
of
flags
high
cornices
crowded
pavements
marble
jewellery
behind
glass
the
whole
seen
through
a
roaring
phantasmagoria
of
competing
and
menacing
vehicles
and
edward
henry
thought
this
is
my
sort
of
place
the
jolting
recommenced
carlo
trent
rebounded
limply
groaning
between
cushions
and
upholstery
edward
henry
tried
to
pretend
that
he
was
not
frightened
then
there
was
a
shock
as
of
the
concussion
of
two
equally
unyielding
natures
a
pane
of
glass
in
mr
seven
limousine
flew
to
fragments
and
the
car
stopped
i
expect
that
a
spring
gone
observed
sachs
with
tranquillity
will
happen
you
know
sometimes
everybody
got
out
sachs
presumption
was
correct
one
of
the
back
wheels
had
failed
to
leap
over
a
hole
in
fifth
avenue
some
eighteen
inches
deep
and
two
feet
long
what
is
that
hole
asked
edward
henry
well
said
sachs
it
just
a
hole
we
better
transfer
to
a
taxi
he
gave
calm
orders
to
his
chauffeur
four
empty
taxis
passed
down
the
sunny
magnificence
of
fifth
avenue
and
ignored
sachs
urgent
waving
the
fifth
stopped
the
baggage
was
strapped
and
tied
to
it
which
process
occupied
much
time
edward
henry
fuming
against
delay
gazed
around
a
nonchalant
policeman
on
a
superb
horse
occupied
the
middle
of
the
road
passed
constantly
across
the
street
in
front
of
his
caracoling
horse
dividing
a
route
for
themselves
in
the
wild
ocean
of
traffic
as
moses
cut
into
the
red
sea
at
intervals
a
knot
of
persons
intimidated
and
yet
daring
would
essay
the
voyage
from
one
pavement
to
the
opposite
pavement
there
was
no
refuge
for
these
adventurers
as
in
decrepit
london
some
apparently
arrived
others
seemed
to
disappear
for
ever
in
the
feverish
welter
of
confused
motion
and
were
never
heard
of
again
the
policeman
easily
accommodating
himself
to
the
caracolings
of
his
mount
gazed
absently
at
edward
henry
and
edward
henry
gazed
first
at
the
policeman
and
then
at
the
high
decorated
grandeur
of
the
buildings
and
then
at
the
assyrian
taxi
into
which
sachs
was
now
ingeniously
inserting
carlo
trent
he
thought
no
mistake
this
street
is
alive
but
what
cemeteries
they
must
have
he
followed
carlo
with
minute
precautions
into
the
interior
of
the
taxi
and
then
came
the
supremely
delicate
operation
that
of
introducing
a
third
person
into
the
same
vehicle
it
was
accomplished
three
chins
and
six
knees
fraternized
in
close
intimacy
but
the
door
would
not
shut
wheezing
snorting
shaking
complaining
the
taxi
drew
slowly
away
from
sachs
luxurious
automobile
and
left
it
forlorn
to
its
chauffeur
sachs
imperturbably
smiled
i
have
two
other
automobiles
said
mr
sachs
in
some
sixty
seconds
the
taxi
stopped
in
front
of
the
tremendous
glass
awning
of
the
stuyvesant
the
baggage
was
unstrapped
the
passengers
were
extracted
one
by
one
from
the
cell
and
edward
henry
saw
sachs
give
two
separate
dollar
bills
to
the
driver
by
jove
he
murmured
i
beg
your
pardon
said
sachs
politely
nothing
said
edward
henry
they
walked
into
the
hotel
and
passed
through
a
long
succession
of
corridors
and
vast
public
rooms
surging
with
men
and
women
what
all
this
crowd
for
asked
edward
henry
what
crowd
asked
sachs
surprised
edward
henry
saw
that
he
had
blundered
i
prefer
the
upper
floors
remarked
sachs
as
they
were
being
flung
upwards
in
a
gilded
elevator
and
passing
rapidly
all
numbers
from
to
the
elevator
made
an
end
of
carlo
trent
manhood
he
collapsed
sachs
regarded
him
and
then
said
i
think
i
get
an
extra
room
for
trent
he
ought
to
go
to
bed
edward
henry
enthusiastically
concurred
and
stay
there
said
edward
henry
pale
carlo
trent
permitted
himself
to
be
put
to
bed
but
therein
he
proved
fractious
he
was
anxious
about
his
linen
sachs
telephoned
from
the
bedside
and
a
came
he
was
anxious
about
his
best
sachs
telephoned
and
a
valet
came
then
he
wanted
a
siphon
of
and
sachs
telephoned
and
a
waiter
came
then
it
was
a
newspaper
he
required
sachs
telephoned
and
a
page
came
all
these
functionaries
together
with
two
reporters
peopled
trent
bedroom
more
or
less
simultaneously
it
was
edward
henry
bright
notion
to
add
to
them
a
doctor
a
doctor
whom
sachs
knew
a
doctor
who
would
perceive
at
once
that
bed
was
the
only
proper
place
for
carlo
trent
now
said
edward
henry
when
he
and
sachs
were
participating
in
a
private
lunch
amid
the
splendours
and
the
grim
silent
service
of
the
latter
suite
at
the
stuyvesant
i
have
fully
grasped
the
fact
that
i
am
in
new
york
it
is
one
and
after
and
as
soon
as
ever
this
meal
is
over
i
have
just
to
find
isabel
joy
you
must
understand
that
on
this
trip
new
york
for
me
is
merely
a
town
where
isabel
joy
happens
to
be
well
replied
sachs
i
reckon
i
can
put
you
on
to
that
going
to
be
photographed
at
two
by
rentoul
i
happen
to
know
because
rent
a
particular
friend
of
mine
a
photographer
you
say
sachs
controlled
himself
do
you
mean
to
say
you
not
heard
of
rentoul
smiles
well
he
called
photographer
he
has
never
photographed
a
woman
wo
at
least
would
but
he
going
to
photograph
isabel
so
you
may
guess
that
he
considers
isabel
woman
eh
and
how
will
that
help
me
inquired
edward
henry
why
i
take
you
up
to
rent
sachs
comforted
him
close
by
corner
of
and
five
tell
me
edward
henry
demanded
with
immense
relief
she
has
got
herself
arrested
yet
has
she
no
and
she
wo
why
not
the
police
have
been
put
wise
said
sachs
put
wise
yes
i
see
said
edward
henry
but
he
did
not
see
he
only
half
saw
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
sachs
isabel
ca
get
away
with
the
goods
unless
she
fixes
the
police
to
lock
her
up
for
a
few
hours
and
she
not
succeed
in
that
her
hundred
days
are
up
in
london
next
sunday
so
there
be
no
time
for
her
to
be
arrested
and
bailed
out
either
at
liverpool
or
fishguard
and
that
her
only
chance
seen
isabel
and
if
you
ask
me
my
opinion
she
down
and
out
never
mind
said
edward
henry
with
glee
i
guess
what
you
after
her
for
said
mr
seven
sachs
with
an
air
of
deep
knowledge
the
deuce
you
do
yes
sir
and
let
me
tell
you
that
dozens
of
have
been
after
her
already
but
she
would
nothing
would
tempt
her
never
mind
edward
henry
smiled
ii
when
edward
henry
stood
by
the
side
of
sachs
in
a
doorway
half
shielded
by
a
and
gazed
unseen
into
the
great
studio
of
rentoul
smiles
he
comprehended
that
he
was
indeed
under
powerful
protection
in
new
york
at
the
entrance
on
fifth
avenue
he
and
sachs
had
passed
through
a
small
crowd
of
assorted
men
chiefly
young
whom
sachs
had
greeted
in
the
mass
with
the
smiling
words
well
boys
other
men
were
within
still
another
went
up
with
them
in
the
elevator
but
no
further
they
were
reporters
of
the
entire
press
to
each
of
whom
isabel
joy
had
been
specially
assigned
they
were
waiting
they
would
wait
rentoul
smiles
having
been
warned
by
telephone
of
the
visit
of
his
beloved
friend
seven
sachs
sachs
and
his
english
had
been
received
at
smiles
outer
door
by
a
clerk
who
knew
exactly
what
to
do
with
them
and
did
it
is
she
here
sachs
had
murmured
yep
the
clerk
had
negligently
replied
and
now
edward
henry
beheld
the
objective
of
his
pilgrimage
her
whose
personality
portrait
and
adventures
had
been
filling
the
newspapers
of
two
hemispheres
for
three
weeks
past
she
was
not
realistically
like
her
portraits
she
was
a
little
thin
pale
obviously
nervous
woman
of
any
age
from
to
fifty
with
fair
untidy
hair
and
pale
eyes
that
showed
the
dreamer
the
idealist
and
the
harsh
fanatic
she
looked
as
though
a
moderate
breeze
would
have
overthrown
her
but
she
also
looked
to
the
enlightened
observer
as
though
she
would
recoil
before
no
cruelty
and
no
suffering
in
pursuit
of
her
vision
the
blind
dreaming
force
behind
her
apparent
frailty
would
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
any
man
intelligent
enough
to
understand
it
edward
henry
had
an
inward
shudder
great
scott
he
reflected
i
should
like
to
be
ill
and
have
isabel
for
a
nurse
and
his
mind
at
once
flew
to
nellie
and
then
to
elsie
april
and
so
she
going
to
marry
wrissell
he
reflected
and
could
scarcely
believe
it
then
he
violently
wrenched
his
mind
back
to
the
immediate
objective
he
wondered
why
isabel
joy
should
wear
a
bowler
hat
and
a
jacket
that
resembled
a
sporting
man
overcoat
and
why
these
garments
suited
her
with
a
whip
in
her
hand
she
could
have
sat
for
a
jockey
and
yet
she
was
a
woman
and
very
feminine
and
probably
old
enough
to
be
elsie
april
mother
a
disconcerting
world
he
thought
the
man
photographer
as
he
was
described
in
copper
on
fifth
avenue
and
in
gold
on
his
own
doors
was
a
big
male
who
loured
over
the
trifle
isabel
like
a
cloud
over
a
sheep
in
a
great
field
edward
henry
could
only
see
his
broad
bending
back
as
he
posed
in
athletic
attitudes
behind
the
camera
suddenly
rentoul
smiles
dashed
to
a
switch
and
isabel
wistful
face
was
transformed
into
that
of
a
drowned
corpse
into
a
dreadful
harmony
of
greens
and
purples
now
said
rentoul
smiles
in
a
deep
voice
that
was
like
a
rich
unguent
we
try
again
we
just
play
around
that
spot
look
into
my
eyes
not
my
eyes
my
dear
woman
them
just
a
little
more
challenge
a
little
more
that
it
do
wink
for
the
sake
now
he
seized
a
bulb
at
the
end
of
a
tube
and
slowly
squeezed
squeezed
it
tragically
and
remorselessly
twisting
himself
as
if
suffering
in
sympathy
with
the
bulb
and
then
in
a
wide
sweeping
gesture
he
flung
the
bulb
on
to
the
top
of
the
camera
and
ejaculated
ha
edward
henry
thought
i
would
give
ten
pounds
to
see
rentoul
smiles
photograph
sir
john
pilgrim
but
the
next
instant
the
forgotten
sensation
of
hurry
was
upon
him
once
more
quick
quick
rentoul
smiles
edward
scorching
desire
was
to
get
done
and
leave
new
york
now
miss
isabel
mr
smiles
proceeded
exasperatingly
deliberate
know
i
feel
kind
of
guilty
i
have
got
a
little
farm
out
in
westchester
county
and
i
making
a
little
english
pathway
up
the
garden
with
a
gate
at
the
end
i
woke
up
this
morning
and
began
to
think
about
the
quaint
english
form
of
that
gate
and
just
how
i
would
have
it
he
raised
a
finger
but
i
ought
to
have
been
thinking
about
you
i
ought
to
have
been
saying
to
myself
i
have
to
photograph
isabel
joy
and
trying
to
understand
in
meditation
the
secrets
of
your
personality
i
sorry
now
do
talk
keep
like
that
move
your
head
round
go
on
go
on
move
it
do
be
afraid
this
place
belongs
to
you
it
yours
whatever
you
do
we
got
people
here
who
straighten
up
after
you
know
why
made
money
i
made
money
so
that
i
can
take
this
afternoon
and
tell
a
client
to
go
to
the
deuce
why
i
made
money
put
your
back
against
the
chair
like
an
englishwoman
that
it
no
do
i
tell
you
now
look
joyful
hang
it
look
joyful
no
no
joy
is
a
contortion
something
right
deep
down
there
there
the
lubricant
voice
rolled
on
while
rentoul
smiles
manipulated
the
camera
he
clasped
the
bulb
again
and
again
threw
it
dramatically
away
i
through
he
said
do
expect
anything
very
grand
miss
isabel
what
i
been
trying
to
do
this
afternoon
is
my
interpretation
of
you
as
i
studied
your
personality
in
your
speeches
if
i
believed
wholly
in
your
cause
or
if
i
wholly
disbelieved
in
it
my
work
would
not
have
been
good
any
value
that
it
has
will
be
due
to
the
sympathetic
impartiality
of
my
spiritual
attitude
although
he
menaced
her
with
the
licensed
familiarity
of
a
philosopher
although
lady
i
must
say
that
i
felt
you
were
working
against
me
all
the
time
this
way
edward
henry
recalling
the
comparative
simplicity
of
the
london
photographer
at
wilkins
thought
how
profoundly
they
understand
photography
in
america
isabel
joy
rose
and
glanced
at
the
watch
in
her
bracelet
then
followed
the
direction
of
the
male
hand
and
vanished
rentoul
smiles
turned
instantly
to
the
other
doorway
how
do
rent
said
seven
sachs
coming
forward
how
do
seven
rentoul
smiles
winked
this
is
my
good
friend
alderman
machin
the
from
london
glad
to
meet
you
sir
she
not
gone
has
she
asked
sachs
hurriedly
no
my
housekeeper
wanted
to
talk
to
her
come
along
and
in
the
full
of
permanent
examples
of
the
results
of
rentoul
smiles
spiritual
attitude
towards
his
edward
henry
was
presented
to
isabel
joy
the
next
instant
the
two
men
and
the
housekeeper
had
unobtrusively
retired
and
he
was
alone
with
his
objective
in
truth
seven
sachs
was
a
notable
organizer
iii
she
was
sitting
down
in
a
her
feet
on
a
footstool
and
she
seemed
a
negligible
physical
quantity
as
he
stood
in
front
of
her
this
was
she
who
had
worsted
the
entire
judicial
and
police
system
of
chicago
who
spoke
pentecostal
tongues
who
had
circled
the
globe
and
held
enthralled
so
journalists
computed
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
the
inhabitants
of
marseilles
athens
port
said
candy
calcutta
bangkok
hong
kong
tokyo
hawaii
san
francisco
salt
lake
city
denver
chicago
and
lastly
new
york
this
was
she
i
understand
we
going
home
on
the
same
ship
he
was
saying
she
looked
up
at
him
almost
appealingly
you
wo
see
anything
of
me
though
she
said
why
not
tell
me
said
she
not
answering
his
question
what
do
they
say
of
me
really
in
england
i
do
mean
the
newspapers
for
instance
well
the
azure
society
do
you
know
it
he
nodded
tell
me
she
repeated
he
related
the
episode
of
the
telegram
at
the
private
first
performance
of
the
orient
pearl
she
burst
out
in
a
torrent
of
irrelevant
protest
the
new
york
police
have
not
treated
me
right
it
would
have
cost
them
nothing
to
arrest
me
and
let
me
go
but
they
would
every
man
in
the
force
you
hear
me
every
man
has
had
strict
orders
to
leave
me
unmolested
it
seems
they
resent
my
dealings
with
the
police
in
chicago
where
i
brought
about
the
dismissal
of
four
officers
so
they
say
and
so
i
to
be
boycotted
in
this
manner
is
that
argument
machin
tell
me
you
a
man
but
honestly
is
it
argument
why
just
as
mean
and
despicable
as
brute
force
i
agree
with
you
said
edward
henry
softly
do
they
really
think
it
will
harm
the
militant
cause
do
they
think
so
no
it
will
only
harm
me
i
made
a
mistake
in
tactics
i
trusted
fool
to
the
chivalry
of
the
united
states
i
might
have
been
arrested
in
a
dozen
cities
but
i
on
purpose
reserved
my
last
two
arrests
for
chicago
and
new
york
for
the
sake
of
the
superior
advertisement
you
see
i
never
dreamt
now
it
too
late
i
am
defeated
i
shall
just
arrive
in
london
on
the
hundredth
day
i
shall
have
made
speeches
at
all
the
meetings
but
i
shall
be
short
of
one
arrest
and
the
ten
thousand
pounds
will
be
lost
to
the
cause
the
militants
here
such
as
they
are
are
as
disgusted
as
i
am
but
they
scorn
me
and
are
they
not
right
are
they
not
right
there
should
be
no
quarter
for
the
vanquished
miss
joy
said
edward
henry
i
come
over
from
london
specially
to
see
you
i
want
to
make
up
the
loss
of
that
ten
thousand
pounds
as
far
as
i
can
i
explain
at
once
i
running
a
poetical
play
of
the
highest
merit
called
orient
pearl
at
my
new
theatre
in
piccadilly
circus
if
you
will
undertake
a
small
part
in
it
a
part
of
three
words
only
i
pay
you
a
record
salary
pounds
thirteen
and
a
word
two
hundred
pounds
a
week
isabel
joy
jumped
up
are
you
another
of
them
then
she
muttered
i
did
think
from
the
look
of
you
that
you
would
know
a
gentlewoman
when
you
met
one
did
you
imagine
for
the
thousandth
part
of
one
second
that
i
would
stoop
stoop
exclaimed
edward
henry
my
theatre
is
not
a
you
want
to
make
it
into
one
she
stopped
him
good
day
to
you
she
said
i
must
face
those
journalists
again
i
suppose
well
even
they
i
came
alone
in
order
to
avoid
them
but
it
was
hopeless
besides
is
it
my
duty
to
avoid
them
after
all
it
was
while
passing
through
the
door
that
she
uttered
the
last
words
where
is
she
seven
sachs
inquired
entering
fled
said
edward
henry
everything
all
right
quite
rentoul
smiles
came
in
mr
smiles
said
edward
henry
did
you
ever
photograph
sir
john
pilgrim
i
did
on
his
last
visit
to
new
york
here
you
are
he
pointed
to
his
rendering
of
sir
john
what
did
you
think
of
him
a
great
actor
but
a
mountebank
sir
during
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
edward
henry
saw
the
whole
of
new
york
with
bits
of
the
bronx
and
yonkers
in
the
distance
from
seven
sachs
second
automobile
in
his
third
automobile
he
went
to
the
theatre
and
saw
seven
sachs
act
to
a
house
of
over
two
thousand
dollars
and
lastly
he
attended
a
supper
and
made
a
speech
but
he
insisted
upon
passing
the
remainder
of
the
night
on
the
in
the
morning
isabel
joy
came
on
board
early
and
irrevocably
disappeared
into
her
berth
and
from
that
moment
edward
henry
spent
the
whole
secret
force
of
his
individuality
in
fervently
desiring
the
to
start
at
two
two
hours
late
she
did
start
edward
henry
farewells
to
the
admirable
and
hospitable
sachs
were
somewhat
for
already
his
heart
was
in
london
but
he
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
make
certain
final
arrangements
keep
him
at
least
a
week
said
edward
henry
to
seven
sachs
and
i
shall
be
your
debtor
for
ever
and
ever
he
meant
carlo
trent
still
bedridden
as
from
the
receding
ship
he
gazed
in
abstraction
at
the
gigantic
inconvenient
word
common
to
three
languages
which
is
the
first
thing
seen
by
the
arriving
and
the
last
thing
seen
by
the
departing
visitor
he
meditated
the
dearness
of
living
in
the
united
states
has
certainly
been
exaggerated
for
his
total
expenses
beyond
the
confines
of
the
quay
amounted
to
one
cent
disbursed
to
buy
an
evening
paper
which
had
contained
a
brief
interview
with
himself
concerning
the
future
of
the
intellectual
drama
in
england
he
had
told
the
pressman
that
the
orient
pearl
would
run
a
hundred
nights
save
for
putting
the
orient
girl
instead
of
the
orient
pearl
and
two
hundred
nights
instead
of
one
hundred
nights
this
interview
was
tolerably
accurate
iv
two
entire
interminable
days
of
the
voyage
elapsed
before
edward
henry
was
clever
enough
to
encounter
isabel
joy
the
most
notorious
and
the
least
visible
person
in
the
ship
he
remembered
that
she
had
said
you
wo
see
anything
of
me
it
was
easy
to
ascertain
the
number
of
her
a
which
she
shared
with
nobody
but
it
was
less
easy
to
find
out
whether
she
ever
left
it
and
if
so
at
what
time
of
day
he
could
not
mount
guard
in
the
long
corridor
and
the
stewardesses
on
the
were
mature
experienced
and
uncommunicative
women
their
sole
weakness
being
an
occasional
tendency
to
imagine
that
they
and
not
the
captain
were
in
supreme
charge
of
the
steamer
however
edward
henry
did
at
last
achieve
his
desire
and
on
the
third
morning
at
a
little
before
six
he
met
a
muffled
isabel
joy
on
the
d
deck
the
d
deck
was
wet
having
just
been
swabbed
and
a
boat
chosen
for
that
ascended
past
them
on
its
way
from
to
the
dizzy
above
on
the
other
side
of
an
iron
barrier
large
crowds
of
passengers
were
standing
and
talking
and
staring
at
the
oblong
slit
of
sea
which
was
the
only
prospect
offered
by
the
d
deck
it
was
the
first
time
that
edward
henry
aboard
had
set
eyes
on
a
steerage
passenger
with
all
the
conceit
natural
to
the
occupant
of
a
costly
he
had
unconsciously
assumed
that
he
and
his
like
had
sole
possession
of
the
ship
isabel
responded
to
his
greeting
in
a
very
natural
way
the
sharp
freshness
of
the
summer
morning
at
sea
had
its
tonic
effect
on
both
of
them
and
as
for
edward
henry
he
lunged
and
plunged
at
once
into
the
subject
which
alone
preoccupied
and
exasperated
him
she
did
not
seem
to
resent
it
you
have
the
satisfaction
of
helping
on
a
thing
that
all
your
friends
say
ought
to
be
helped
he
argued
nobody
but
you
can
do
it
without
you
there
be
a
frost
you
would
make
a
lot
of
money
which
you
could
spend
in
helping
on
things
of
your
own
and
surely
it
the
publicity
that
you
afraid
of
no
she
agreed
i
not
afraid
of
publicity
her
pale
eyes
shone
as
they
regarded
the
secret
dream
that
for
her
hung
always
unseen
in
the
air
and
she
had
a
strange
wistful
fragile
feminine
mien
in
her
mannish
costume
well
then
but
ca
you
see
it
humiliating
cried
she
as
if
interested
in
the
argument
it
not
humiliating
to
do
something
that
you
can
do
well
i
know
you
can
do
it
well
and
get
a
large
salary
for
it
and
make
the
success
of
a
big
enterprise
by
it
if
you
knew
the
play
i
do
know
the
play
she
said
we
lots
of
us
read
it
in
manuscript
long
ago
edward
henry
was
somewhat
dashed
by
this
information
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
it
just
splendid
said
she
with
enthusiasm
and
will
it
be
any
worse
a
play
because
you
act
a
small
part
in
it
no
she
said
shortly
i
expect
you
think
it
a
play
that
people
ought
to
go
and
see
you
i
do
socrates
she
admitted
he
wondered
what
she
could
mean
but
continued
what
does
it
matter
what
it
is
that
brings
the
audience
into
the
theatre
so
long
as
they
get
there
and
have
to
listen
she
sighed
it
no
use
discussing
with
you
she
murmured
you
too
simple
for
this
world
i
daresay
you
honest
enough
in
fact
i
think
you
are
but
there
are
so
many
things
that
you
do
understand
evidently
incapable
of
understanding
them
thanks
he
replied
and
paused
to
recover
his
but
let
get
right
down
to
business
now
if
you
appear
in
this
play
i
not
merely
give
you
two
hundred
pounds
a
week
but
i
explain
to
you
how
to
get
arrested
and
still
arrive
in
triumph
in
london
before
midnight
on
sunday
she
recoiled
a
step
and
raised
her
eyes
how
she
demanded
as
with
a
pistol
ah
he
said
that
just
it
how
will
you
promise
i
thought
of
everything
she
said
musingly
if
the
last
day
was
any
day
but
sunday
i
could
get
arrested
on
landing
and
get
bailed
out
and
still
be
in
london
before
night
but
on
sunday
no
so
you
need
talk
like
that
still
he
said
it
can
be
done
how
she
demanded
again
will
you
sign
a
contract
with
me
if
i
tell
you
think
of
what
your
reception
in
london
will
be
if
you
win
after
all
just
think
those
pale
eyes
gleamed
for
isabel
joy
had
tasted
the
noisy
flattery
of
sympathetic
and
of
adverse
crowds
and
her
being
hungered
for
it
again
the
desire
of
it
had
become
part
of
her
nature
she
walked
away
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
ulster
and
returned
what
is
your
scheme
you
sign
yes
if
it
works
i
can
trust
you
the
little
woman
of
forty
or
so
blazed
up
you
can
refrain
from
insulting
me
by
doubting
my
word
said
she
sorry
sorry
he
apologized
v
that
same
evening
in
the
colossal
of
the
edward
henry
sat
as
usual
to
the
left
of
the
empty
chair
at
the
purser
table
where
were
about
a
dozen
other
men
a
page
brought
him
a
marconigram
he
opened
it
and
read
the
single
word
nineteen
it
was
the
amount
of
the
previous
receipts
at
the
regent
in
pounds
he
was
now
losing
something
like
forty
pounds
a
night
without
counting
the
expenses
of
the
present
excursion
the
band
began
to
play
as
the
soup
was
served
and
the
ship
rolled
politely
gently
but
nevertheless
unmistakably
accomplishing
one
complete
roll
to
about
sixteen
bars
of
the
music
then
the
entire
saloon
was
suddenly
excited
isabel
joy
had
entered
she
was
in
the
gallery
near
the
orchestra
at
a
small
table
alone
everybody
became
aware
of
the
fact
in
an
instant
and
scores
of
necks
on
the
lower
floor
were
twisted
to
glimpse
the
celebrity
on
the
upper
it
was
remarked
that
she
wore
a
magnificent
one
subject
of
conversation
now
occupied
all
the
tables
and
it
was
fully
occupying
the
purser
table
when
the
purser
generally
a
little
late
owing
to
the
arduousness
of
his
situation
on
the
ship
entered
and
sat
down
now
the
purser
was
a
northerner
from
durham
a
delightful
companion
in
his
lighter
moods
but
dour
and
with
a
high
conception
of
authority
and
of
the
intelligence
of
dogs
he
would
relate
that
when
he
and
his
wife
wanted
to
keep
a
secret
from
their
yorkshire
terrier
they
had
to
spell
the
crucial
words
in
talk
for
the
dog
understood
their
every
sentence
the
purser
views
about
the
cause
represented
by
isabel
joy
were
absolutely
clear
none
could
mistake
them
and
the
few
clauses
which
he
curtly
added
to
the
discussion
rather
damped
the
discussion
and
there
was
a
pause
what
should
you
do
purser
said
edward
henry
if
she
began
to
play
any
of
her
tricks
here
if
she
began
to
play
any
of
her
tricks
in
this
ship
answered
the
purser
putting
his
hands
on
his
stout
knees
we
should
know
what
to
do
of
course
you
can
arrest
most
decidedly
i
could
tell
you
things
the
purser
stopped
for
experience
had
taught
him
to
be
very
discreet
with
passengers
until
he
had
voyaged
with
them
at
least
ten
times
he
concluded
the
captain
is
the
representative
of
english
law
on
an
english
ship
and
then
in
the
silence
created
by
the
resting
orchestra
all
in
the
saloon
could
hear
a
clear
piercing
woman
voice
oratorical
at
first
and
then
quickening
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
on
the
subject
of
the
injustice
of
men
to
women
isabel
joy
was
on
her
feet
and
leaning
over
the
gallery
rail
as
she
proceeded
a
startled
hush
changed
to
uproar
and
in
the
uproar
could
be
caught
now
and
then
a
detached
phrase
such
as
for
example
this
ship
possibly
it
was
just
this
phrase
that
roused
the
northerner
in
the
purser
he
rose
and
looked
towards
the
captain
table
but
the
captain
was
not
dining
in
the
saloon
that
evening
then
he
strode
to
the
centre
of
the
saloon
beneath
the
renowned
dome
which
has
been
so
often
photographed
for
the
illustrated
papers
and
sought
to
destroy
isabel
joy
with
a
single
marine
glance
having
failed
he
called
out
loudly
be
quiet
madam
resume
your
seat
isabel
joy
stopped
for
a
second
gave
him
a
glance
far
more
homicidal
than
his
own
and
resumed
her
discourse
steward
cried
the
purser
take
that
woman
out
of
the
saloon
the
whole
complement
of
passengers
was
now
standing
up
and
many
of
them
saw
a
plate
descend
from
on
high
and
graze
the
purser
shoulder
with
the
celebrity
of
a
sprinter
the
man
of
authority
from
durham
disappeared
from
the
and
was
immediately
seen
in
the
gallery
accounts
differed
afterwards
as
to
the
exact
order
of
events
but
it
is
certain
that
the
leader
of
the
band
lost
his
fiddle
which
was
broken
by
the
lusty
isabel
on
the
purser
head
it
was
known
later
that
isabel
though
not
exactly
in
irons
was
under
arrest
in
her
she
really
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
for
herself
if
she
as
smart
as
she
thinks
she
is
said
edward
henry
privately
vi
though
he
was
on
the
way
to
high
success
his
anxieties
and
solicitudes
seemed
to
increase
every
hour
immediately
after
isabel
joy
arrest
he
became
more
than
ever
a
crony
of
the
marconi
operator
and
began
to
dispatch
vivid
and
urgent
telegrams
to
london
without
counting
the
cost
on
the
next
day
he
began
to
receive
replies
it
was
the
most
interesting
voyage
that
the
marconi
operator
had
had
since
the
sinking
of
the
of
in
which
episode
his
promptness
through
the
air
had
certainly
saved
two
hundred
lives
edward
henry
could
scarcely
sleep
so
intense
was
his
longing
for
sunday
night
his
desire
to
be
safe
in
london
with
isabel
joy
nay
he
could
not
properly
eat
and
then
the
doubt
entered
his
mind
whether
after
all
he
would
get
to
london
on
sunday
night
for
the
was
lagging
she
might
have
been
doing
it
on
purpose
to
ruin
him
every
day
in
the
on
the
ship
run
it
was
the
holder
of
the
lower
field
that
pocketed
the
money
of
his
the
actually
descended
below
five
hundred
and
forty
knots
in
the
hours
and
no
authoritative
explanation
of
this
behaviour
was
ever
given
upon
leaving
new
york
there
had
been
talk
of
reaching
fishguard
on
saturday
evening
but
now
the
prophesied
moment
of
arrival
had
been
put
forward
to
noon
on
sunday
edward
henry
sole
consolation
was
that
each
day
on
the
eastward
trip
consisted
of
only
hours
further
he
was
by
no
means
free
from
apprehension
about
the
personal
liberty
of
isabel
joy
isabel
had
exceeded
the
programme
arranged
between
them
it
had
been
no
part
of
his
scheme
that
she
should
cast
plates
nor
even
break
violins
on
the
shining
crown
of
an
august
purser
the
purser
was
angry
and
he
had
the
captain
a
milder
man
behind
him
when
isabel
joy
threatened
a
if
she
was
not
immediately
released
the
purser
signified
that
she
might
proceed
with
her
he
well
knew
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
expire
of
inanition
before
the
arrival
at
fishguard
the
case
was
serious
because
isabel
joy
had
created
a
precedent
policemen
and
cabinet
ministers
had
for
many
months
been
regarded
as
the
lawful
prey
of
militants
but
isabel
joy
was
the
first
of
the
militants
to
damage
property
and
heads
which
belonged
to
persons
of
neither
of
those
classes
and
the
authorities
of
the
ship
were
assuredly
inclined
to
hand
isabel
joy
over
to
the
police
at
fishguard
what
saved
the
situation
for
edward
henry
was
the
factor
which
saves
most
situations
namely
public
opinion
when
the
saloon
clearly
realized
that
isabel
joy
had
done
what
she
had
done
with
the
pure
and
innocent
aim
of
winning
a
wager
all
that
was
in
the
saloon
ranged
itself
on
the
side
of
true
sport
and
the
matter
was
lifted
above
mere
politics
a
subscription
was
inaugurated
to
buy
a
new
fiddle
and
to
pay
for
shattered
crockery
and
the
amount
collected
would
have
purchased
after
settling
for
the
crockery
a
couple
of
dozen
new
fiddles
the
unneeded
balance
was
given
to
seamen
orphanages
the
purser
was
approached
the
captain
was
implored
influence
was
brought
to
bear
in
short
the
wheels
that
are
within
wheels
went
duly
round
and
miss
isabel
joy
after
apologies
and
promises
was
unconditionally
released
but
she
had
been
arrested
and
then
early
on
sunday
morning
the
ship
met
a
storm
that
had
a
sad
influence
on
divine
service
a
storm
of
the
eminence
that
scares
even
the
occupants
of
liners
bridges
the
rumour
went
round
the
ship
that
the
captain
would
not
call
at
fishguard
in
such
weather
edward
henry
was
ready
to
yield
up
his
spirit
in
this
fearful
crisis
which
endured
two
hours
the
captain
did
call
at
fishguard
in
pouring
rain
and
men
came
aboard
selling
sunday
newspapers
that
were
full
of
isabel
arrest
on
the
steamer
and
of
the
nearing
triumph
of
her
arrival
in
london
before
midnight
and
newspaper
correspondents
also
came
aboard
and
all
the
way
on
the
tender
and
in
the
sheds
and
in
the
train
edward
henry
and
isabel
joy
were
subjected
to
the
journalistic
experiments
of
hardy
interviewers
the
train
arrived
at
paddington
at
isabel
had
won
by
three
hours
the
station
was
a
surging
throng
of
curiosities
edward
henry
would
not
lose
sight
of
his
priceless
charge
but
he
sent
harrier
to
despatch
a
telegram
to
nellie
whose
wifely
interest
in
his
movements
he
had
till
then
either
forgotten
or
ignored
and
even
now
his
mind
was
not
free
he
saw
in
front
of
him
still
hours
of
anguish
vii
the
next
night
just
before
the
curtain
went
up
he
stood
on
the
stage
of
the
regent
theatre
and
it
is
a
fact
that
he
was
trembling
not
with
fear
but
with
simple
excitement
through
what
a
day
he
had
passed
there
had
been
the
rehearsal
in
the
morning
it
had
gone
off
very
well
save
that
rose
euclid
had
behaved
impossibly
and
that
the
cunningham
girl
the
hit
of
the
piece
but
ousted
from
her
part
had
filled
the
place
with
just
lamentations
and
recriminations
and
then
had
followed
the
appalling
scene
with
rose
euclid
rose
leaving
the
theatre
for
lunch
had
beheld
workmen
removing
her
name
from
the
electric
sign
and
substituting
that
of
isabel
joy
she
was
a
woman
and
an
artist
and
it
would
have
been
the
same
had
she
been
a
man
and
an
artist
she
would
not
submit
to
this
inconceivable
affront
she
had
resigned
her
she
had
ripped
her
contract
to
bits
and
flung
the
bits
to
the
breeze
upon
the
whole
edward
henry
had
been
glad
he
had
sent
for
miss
cunningham
who
was
rose
understudy
had
given
her
her
instructions
called
another
rehearsal
for
the
afternoon
and
effected
a
saving
of
nearly
half
isabel
joy
fantastic
salary
then
he
had
entered
into
financial
negotiations
with
four
evening
papers
and
managed
to
buy
at
a
price
their
for
the
day
so
that
all
the
west
end
was
filled
with
men
and
boys
wearing
like
aprons
posters
which
bore
the
words
isabel
joy
to
appear
at
the
regent
a
great
and
an
original
stroke
and
now
he
gazed
through
the
of
the
curtain
upon
a
crammed
and
auditorium
the
assistant
ordered
him
off
the
curtain
went
up
on
the
drama
in
hexameters
he
waited
in
the
wings
and
spoke
soothingly
to
isabel
joy
who
looking
juvenile
in
the
airy
costume
of
the
messenger
stood
flutteringly
agog
for
her
cue
he
heard
the
thunderous
crashing
roar
that
met
her
entrance
he
did
not
hear
her
line
he
walked
forth
to
the
glazed
balcony
at
the
front
of
the
house
where
in
the
dandies
smoked
cigarettes
baptized
with
girlish
names
he
could
see
piccadilly
circus
and
he
saw
piccadilly
circus
thronged
with
a
multitude
of
loafers
who
were
happy
in
the
mere
spectacle
of
isabel
joy
name
glowing
on
an
electric
sign
he
went
back
at
last
to
the
managerial
room
marrier
was
there
got
the
figures
yet
he
asked
marrier
beamed
two
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
as
long
as
it
keeps
up
it
means
a
profit
of
getting
on
for
two
hundred
a
naight
but
dash
it
man
the
house
only
holds
two
hundred
and
thirty
but
my
good
sir
said
marrier
they
paying
ten
shillings
a
piece
to
stand
up
in
the
edward
henry
dropped
into
a
chair
at
the
desk
a
telegram
was
lying
there
addressed
to
himself
what
this
he
demanded
just
cam
he
opened
it
and
read
i
absolutely
forbid
this
monstrous
outrage
on
a
work
of
trent
bit
late
in
the
day
is
he
said
edward
henry
showing
the
telegram
to
marrier
besides
marrier
observed
he
come
round
when
he
knows
what
his
royalties
are
well
said
edward
henry
i
going
to
bed
and
he
gave
a
devastating
yawn
viii
one
afternoon
edward
henry
sat
in
the
king
of
all
the
in
the
of
his
house
in
trafalgar
road
bursley
although
the
month
was
september
and
the
weather
warm
even
for
september
a
swansdown
quilt
lay
spread
upon
his
knees
his
face
was
pale
his
hands
were
paler
but
his
eye
was
clear
and
his
visage
enlightened
his
beard
had
grown
to
nearly
its
original
dimensions
on
a
chair
by
his
side
were
a
number
of
letters
to
which
he
had
just
dictated
answers
at
a
neighbouring
table
a
young
clerk
was
using
a
typewriter
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
sofa
was
robert
machin
engaged
in
the
perusal
of
the
second
edition
of
that
day
of
late
robert
having
exhausted
nearly
all
available
books
had
been
cultivating
during
his
holidays
an
interest
in
journalism
and
he
would
give
great
accounts
in
the
nursery
of
events
happening
in
each
day
instalment
of
the
sensational
serial
his
heels
kicked
idly
one
against
the
other
a
powerful
voice
resounded
in
the
lobby
and
dr
stirling
entered
the
room
with
nellie
well
edward
henry
greeted
him
so
you
in
full
blast
again
observed
the
doctor
using
a
metaphor
invented
by
the
population
of
a
district
where
the
roar
of
furnaces
wakens
the
night
no
edward
henry
protested
as
an
invalid
always
will
i
only
just
keeping
an
eye
on
one
or
two
pressing
things
of
course
he
in
full
blast
said
nellie
with
calm
conviction
what
this
i
hear
about
ye
ganging
away
to
the
seaside
saturday
asked
the
doctor
well
ca
i
said
edward
henry
ye
can
said
the
doctor
let
have
a
look
at
ye
man
what
was
it
you
said
i
had
edward
henry
questioned
colitis
yes
that
the
word
i
thought
i
could
have
got
it
wrong
well
you
should
have
seen
my
mother
face
when
i
told
her
what
you
called
it
she
said
may
call
it
that
if
he
a
mind
to
but
we
had
another
name
for
it
in
my
time
you
should
have
heard
her
sniff
look
here
do
you
know
you
had
me
down
now
for
pretty
near
three
months
nay
said
stirling
it
yer
own
obstinacy
that
had
ye
down
man
if
ye
listened
to
yer
london
doctor
at
first
mayhap
ye
have
had
to
travel
from
euston
in
an
invalid
carriage
if
ye
had
the
misfortune
to
be
born
an
obstinate
simpleton
ye
ha
been
up
and
about
six
weeks
back
but
there
no
doing
anything
with
you
geniuses
it
all
nerves
with
you
and
your
like
nerves
exclaimed
edward
henry
pretending
to
scorn
but
he
was
delighted
at
the
diagnosis
nerves
repeated
the
doctor
firmly
ye
go
gadding
off
to
america
ye
get
yeself
mixed
up
in
theatres
how
the
theatre
i
see
yer
famous
play
coming
to
an
end
next
week
and
what
if
it
is
said
edward
henry
jealous
for
reputations
including
his
own
it
will
have
run
for
a
hundred
and
one
nights
and
right
through
august
too
no
modern
poetry
play
ever
did
run
as
long
in
london
and
no
other
ever
will
i
given
the
intellectual
theatre
the
biggest
ad
it
ever
had
and
i
made
money
on
it
i
should
have
made
more
if
i
ended
the
run
a
fortnight
ago
but
i
was
determined
to
pass
the
hundredth
night
and
i
shall
do
and
what
are
ye
for
giving
next
i
not
for
giving
anything
next
doc
i
let
the
regent
for
five
years
at
seven
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
a
musical
comedy
syndicate
since
you
so
curious
and
when
i
paid
the
ground
rent
and
taxes
and
repairs
and
something
towards
a
and
six
per
cent
on
my
capital
i
shall
have
not
far
off
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
clear
annual
profit
you
may
say
what
you
like
but
that
what
i
call
business
it
was
a
remarkable
fact
that
while
giving
undemanded
information
to
stirling
edward
henry
was
in
reality
defending
himself
against
the
accusations
of
his
wife
accusations
which
by
the
way
she
had
never
uttered
but
which
he
thought
he
read
sometimes
in
her
face
he
might
of
course
have
told
his
wife
these
agreeable
details
directly
and
in
private
but
he
was
a
husband
and
like
many
husbands
apt
to
be
indirect
nellie
said
not
a
word
then
you
giving
up
london
the
doctor
rose
to
depart
i
am
said
edward
henry
almost
blushing
why
well
the
genius
answered
those
theatrical
things
are
altogether
too
exciting
and
risky
and
they
such
queer
people
great
scott
i
come
out
on
the
right
side
as
it
happens
but
well
i
not
as
young
as
i
was
i
done
with
london
the
five
towns
are
good
enough
for
me
nellie
unable
to
restrain
a
note
of
triumph
indiscreetly
remarked
with
just
the
air
of
superior
sagacity
that
in
a
wife
drives
husbands
to
fury
and
to
foolishness
i
should
think
so
indeed
edward
henry
leaped
from
his
chair
and
the
swansdown
quilt
swathed
his
slippered
feet
nell
he
exploded
clenching
his
hand
if
you
say
that
once
more
in
that
tone
once
more
mind
i
go
and
take
a
flat
in
london
the
doctor
crackled
with
laughter
nellie
smiled
even
robert
who
had
completely
ignored
the
doctor
entrance
glanced
round
with
creased
brows
sit
down
dearest
nellie
quietly
enjoined
the
invalid
but
he
would
not
sit
down
and
to
show
his
independence
he
helped
his
wife
to
escort
stirling
into
the
lobby
robert
now
alone
with
the
ignored
young
clerk
tapping
at
the
table
turned
towards
him
and
in
his
deliberate
judicial
disdainful
childish
voice
said
to
him
is
father
a
funny
man
