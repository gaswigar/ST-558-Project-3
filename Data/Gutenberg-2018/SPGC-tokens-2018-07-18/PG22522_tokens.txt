prologue
at
full
length
on
the
great
divan
of
a
studio
cigar
in
mouth
two
friends
a
poet
and
a
painter
were
talking
together
one
evening
after
was
the
hour
of
confidences
and
effusion
the
lamp
burned
softly
beneath
its
shade
limiting
its
circle
of
light
to
the
intimacy
of
the
conversation
leaving
scarcely
distinct
the
capricious
luxury
of
the
vast
walls
cumbered
with
canvases
hangings
panoplies
surmounted
by
a
glass
roof
through
which
the
sombre
blue
shades
of
the
night
penetrated
unhindered
the
portrait
of
a
woman
leaning
slightly
forward
as
if
to
listen
alone
stood
out
a
little
from
the
shadow
young
with
intelligent
eyes
a
grave
and
sweet
mouth
and
a
spirituel
smile
which
seemed
to
defend
the
husband
easel
from
fools
and
disparagers
a
low
chair
pushed
away
from
the
fire
two
little
blue
shoes
lying
on
the
carpet
indicated
also
the
presence
of
a
child
in
the
house
and
indeed
from
the
next
room
within
which
mother
and
child
had
but
just
disappeared
came
occasional
bursts
of
soft
laughter
of
childish
babble
the
pretty
flutterings
of
a
nest
going
off
to
sleep
all
this
shed
over
the
artistic
interior
a
vague
perfume
of
family
happiness
which
the
poet
breathed
in
with
delight
my
dear
fellow
he
said
to
his
friend
you
were
in
the
right
there
are
no
two
ways
of
being
happy
happiness
lies
in
this
and
in
nothing
else
you
must
find
me
a
wife
the
painter
heavens
no
not
on
any
account
find
one
for
yourself
if
you
are
bent
upon
it
as
for
me
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
poet
why
the
painter
because
artists
ought
never
to
the
poet
rather
too
good
you
dare
to
say
that
and
the
lamp
does
not
go
out
suddenly
and
the
walls
do
fall
down
upon
your
head
but
just
think
wretch
that
for
two
hours
past
you
have
been
setting
before
me
the
enviable
spectacle
of
the
very
happiness
you
forbid
me
are
you
by
chance
like
those
odious
millionaires
whose
is
by
the
sufferings
of
others
and
who
better
enjoy
their
own
fireside
when
they
reflect
that
it
is
raining
out
of
doors
and
that
there
are
plenty
of
poor
devils
without
a
shelter
the
painter
of
me
what
you
will
i
have
too
much
affection
for
you
to
help
you
to
commit
a
folly
an
irreparable
the
poet
what
is
it
you
are
not
satisfied
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
one
breathes
in
happiness
here
just
as
freely
as
one
does
the
air
of
heaven
at
a
country
the
painter
are
right
i
am
happy
completely
happy
i
love
my
wife
with
all
my
heart
when
i
think
of
my
child
i
laugh
aloud
to
myself
with
pleasure
marriage
for
me
has
been
a
harbour
of
calm
and
safe
waters
not
one
in
which
you
make
fast
to
a
ring
on
the
shore
at
the
risk
of
rusting
there
for
ever
but
one
of
those
blue
creeks
where
sails
and
masts
are
repaired
for
fresh
excursions
into
unknown
countries
i
never
worked
as
well
as
i
have
since
my
marriage
all
my
best
pictures
date
from
the
poet
then
the
painter
dear
fellow
at
the
risk
of
seeming
a
coxcomb
i
will
say
that
i
look
upon
my
happiness
as
a
kind
of
miracle
something
abnormal
and
exceptional
yes
the
more
i
see
what
marriage
is
the
more
i
look
back
with
terror
at
the
risk
i
ran
i
am
like
those
who
ignorant
of
the
dangers
they
have
unwittingly
gone
through
turn
pale
when
all
is
over
amazed
at
their
own
the
poet
what
then
are
these
terrible
dangers
the
painter
first
and
greatest
of
all
is
the
loss
or
degradation
of
talent
this
should
count
i
think
with
an
artist
for
observe
that
at
this
moment
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
i
grant
you
that
in
general
marriage
is
an
excellent
thing
and
that
the
majority
of
men
only
begin
to
be
of
some
account
when
the
family
circle
completes
them
or
makes
them
greater
often
indeed
it
is
necessary
to
a
profession
a
bachelor
lawyer
can
not
even
be
imagined
he
would
not
have
the
needful
air
of
weight
and
gravity
but
for
all
of
us
painters
poets
sculptors
musicians
who
live
outside
of
life
wholly
occupied
in
studying
it
in
reproducing
it
holding
ourselves
always
a
little
remote
from
it
as
one
steps
back
from
a
picture
the
better
to
see
it
i
say
that
marriage
can
only
be
the
exception
to
that
nervous
exacting
impressionable
being
that
that
we
call
an
artist
a
special
type
of
woman
almost
impossible
to
find
is
needful
and
the
safest
thing
to
do
is
not
to
look
for
her
ah
how
well
our
great
delacroix
whom
you
admire
so
much
understood
that
what
a
fine
existence
was
his
bounded
by
his
studio
wall
devoted
exclusively
to
art
i
was
looking
the
other
day
at
his
cottage
at
champrosay
and
the
prim
little
garden
full
of
roses
where
he
sauntered
alone
for
twenty
years
it
has
the
calm
and
the
narrowness
of
celibacy
well
now
think
for
a
moment
of
delacroix
married
father
of
a
family
with
all
the
preoccupations
of
children
to
bring
up
of
money
matters
of
illnesses
do
you
believe
his
work
would
have
been
the
same
the
poet
cite
delacroix
i
reply
victor
hugo
do
you
think
that
marriage
hampered
him
for
instance
while
writing
so
many
admirable
books
the
painter
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
marriage
did
not
hamper
him
in
anything
but
all
husbands
have
not
the
genius
that
obtains
pardon
nor
a
halo
of
glory
with
which
to
dry
the
tears
they
cause
to
flow
it
can
not
be
very
amusing
to
be
the
wife
of
a
genius
there
are
plenty
of
labourers
wives
who
are
the
poet
curious
thing
all
the
same
this
special
pleading
against
marriage
by
a
married
man
who
is
happy
in
being
the
painter
repeat
that
i
do
give
myself
as
an
example
my
opinion
is
formed
by
all
the
sad
things
i
have
seen
elsewhere
all
the
misunderstandings
so
frequent
in
the
households
of
artists
and
caused
solely
by
their
abnormal
life
look
at
that
sculptor
who
in
full
maturity
of
age
and
talent
has
just
exiled
himself
leaving
wife
and
children
behind
him
public
opinion
condemns
him
and
certainly
i
offer
no
excuse
for
him
and
nevertheless
i
can
well
understand
how
he
arrived
at
such
a
point
here
was
a
fellow
who
adored
his
art
and
had
a
horror
of
the
world
and
society
the
wife
though
amiable
and
intelligent
instead
of
shielding
him
from
the
social
obligations
he
loathed
condemned
him
for
some
ten
years
to
all
the
exactions
they
involved
thus
she
induced
him
to
undertake
a
lot
of
official
busts
horrible
respectabilities
in
velvet
skull
caps
frights
of
women
utterly
devoid
of
grace
she
disturbed
him
ten
times
a
day
with
importunate
visitors
and
then
every
evening
laid
out
for
him
a
dress
suit
and
light
gloves
and
dragged
him
from
to
you
will
tell
me
he
could
have
rebelled
could
have
replied
no
but
do
you
know
that
the
very
fact
of
our
sedentary
existences
leaves
us
more
than
other
men
dependent
on
domestic
influence
the
atmosphere
of
the
home
envelopes
us
and
if
some
touch
of
the
ideal
does
not
lighten
it
soon
wearies
and
drags
us
down
moreover
the
artist
as
a
rule
puts
what
force
and
energy
he
has
into
his
work
and
after
his
solitary
and
patient
struggles
finds
himself
left
with
no
will
to
oppose
to
the
petty
importunities
of
life
with
him
feminine
tyrannies
have
free
play
no
one
is
more
easily
conquered
and
subdued
only
beware
he
must
not
be
made
to
feel
the
yoke
too
heavily
if
one
day
the
invisible
bonds
with
which
he
is
surreptitiously
fettered
are
drawn
too
tight
and
arrest
the
artistic
effort
he
will
all
at
once
tear
them
asunder
and
mistrusting
his
own
weakness
will
fly
like
our
sculptor
over
the
hills
and
far
wife
of
this
sculptor
was
astounded
at
his
flight
the
unhappy
creature
is
still
wondering
what
can
i
have
done
to
him
nothing
she
simply
did
not
understand
him
for
it
is
not
enough
to
be
good
and
intelligent
to
be
the
true
helpmate
of
an
artist
a
woman
must
also
possess
infinite
tact
smiling
abnegation
and
all
this
is
found
only
by
a
miracle
in
a
young
creature
curious
though
ignorant
as
regards
life
she
is
pretty
she
has
married
a
man
received
everywhere
why
should
she
not
wish
to
show
herself
a
little
on
his
arm
is
it
not
quite
natural
the
husband
on
the
contrary
growing
intolerant
of
society
as
his
talent
progresses
finding
time
short
and
art
engrossing
refuses
to
be
exhibited
behold
them
both
miserable
and
whether
the
man
gives
in
or
resists
his
life
is
henceforward
turned
from
its
course
and
from
its
tranquillity
ah
how
many
of
these
couples
have
i
known
where
the
wife
was
sometimes
executioner
sometimes
victim
but
more
often
executioner
and
nearly
always
unwittingly
so
the
other
evening
i
was
at
dargenty
the
musician
there
were
but
a
few
guests
and
he
was
asked
to
play
hardly
had
he
begun
one
off
those
pretty
mazurkas
with
a
polish
rhythm
which
make
him
the
successor
of
chopin
when
his
wife
began
to
talk
quite
low
at
first
then
a
little
louder
by
degrees
the
fire
of
conversation
spread
at
the
end
of
a
minute
i
was
the
only
listener
then
he
shut
the
piano
and
said
to
me
with
a
smile
it
is
always
like
this
here
my
wife
does
not
care
for
music
can
you
imagine
anything
more
terrible
than
to
marry
a
woman
who
does
not
care
for
your
art
take
my
word
for
it
my
friend
and
do
marry
you
are
alone
you
are
free
keep
as
precious
things
your
liberty
and
your
the
poet
is
all
very
well
you
talk
at
your
ease
of
solitude
presently
when
i
am
gone
if
some
idea
occurs
to
you
you
will
gently
follow
it
by
the
side
of
your
dying
embers
without
feeling
around
you
that
atmosphere
of
isolation
so
vast
so
empty
that
in
it
inspiration
evaporates
and
disperses
and
one
may
yet
fear
to
be
alone
in
the
hours
of
work
but
there
are
moments
of
discouragement
and
weariness
when
one
doubts
oneself
ones
art
even
that
is
the
moment
when
it
must
be
happiness
to
find
a
faithful
and
loving
heart
ever
ready
to
sympathize
with
one
depression
to
which
one
may
appeal
without
fearing
to
disconcert
a
confidence
and
enthusiasm
that
are
in
fact
unalterable
and
then
the
child
that
sweet
unconscious
baby
smile
is
not
that
the
best
moral
rejuvenescence
one
can
have
ah
i
have
often
thought
over
that
for
us
artists
vain
as
all
must
be
who
live
by
success
by
that
superficial
esteem
capricious
and
fleeting
that
we
call
the
vogue
for
us
above
all
others
children
are
indispensable
they
alone
can
console
us
for
growing
old
all
that
we
lose
the
child
gains
the
success
we
have
missed
we
think
he
will
have
it
and
in
proportion
as
our
hair
grows
thin
we
have
the
joy
of
seeing
it
grow
again
curly
golden
full
of
life
on
a
little
fair
head
at
our
the
painter
poet
poet
have
you
thought
also
of
all
the
mouthfuls
by
which
with
the
end
of
pen
or
brush
we
must
nourish
a
brood
the
poet
say
what
you
like
the
artist
is
made
for
family
life
and
that
is
so
true
that
those
among
us
who
do
not
marry
take
refuge
in
temporary
companionships
like
travellers
who
tired
of
being
always
end
by
settling
in
a
room
in
some
hotel
and
pass
their
lives
under
the
hackneyed
notice
of
the
signboard
apartments
by
the
month
or
night
the
painter
are
all
in
the
wrong
they
accept
the
worries
of
wedlock
and
will
never
know
its
the
poet
you
acknowledge
then
that
there
are
some
joys
the
painter
instead
of
replying
rose
searched
out
from
among
drawings
and
sketches
a
manuscript
and
returning
to
his
companion
we
might
argue
like
this
said
he
for
ever
so
long
without
either
convincing
the
other
but
since
notwithstanding
my
observations
you
seem
determined
to
try
marriage
here
is
a
little
work
i
beg
you
to
read
it
is
written
i
would
have
you
note
by
a
married
man
much
in
love
with
his
wife
very
happy
in
his
home
an
observer
who
spending
his
life
among
artists
amused
himself
by
sketching
one
or
two
such
households
as
i
spoke
of
just
now
from
the
first
to
the
last
line
of
this
book
all
is
true
so
true
that
the
author
would
never
publish
it
read
it
and
come
to
me
when
you
have
read
it
i
think
you
will
have
changed
your
mind
poet
took
the
manuscript
and
carried
it
home
with
him
but
he
did
not
keep
the
little
book
with
all
the
needful
care
for
i
have
been
able
to
detach
a
few
leaves
from
it
and
boldly
offer
them
to
the
illustration
madame
heurtebise
she
was
certainly
not
intended
for
an
artist
wife
above
all
for
such
an
artist
as
this
outrageous
fellow
impassioned
uproarious
and
exuberant
who
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
bristling
moustaches
rushed
through
life
defiantly
flaunting
the
eccentric
and
name
of
heurtebise
like
a
challenge
thrown
down
to
all
the
absurd
conventionalities
and
prejudices
of
the
class
how
and
by
what
strange
charm
had
the
little
woman
brought
up
in
a
shop
behind
rows
of
watch
chains
and
strings
of
rings
found
the
means
of
captivating
this
poet
hit
the
blast
literally
picture
to
yourself
the
affected
graces
of
a
shopwoman
with
insignificant
features
cold
and
eyes
complacent
and
placid
physiognomy
devoid
of
real
elegance
but
having
a
certain
love
for
glitter
and
tinsel
no
doubt
caught
at
her
father
shopwindow
making
her
take
pleasure
in
satin
bows
sashes
and
buckles
and
her
hair
glossy
with
cosmetic
stiffly
arranged
by
the
hairdresser
over
a
small
obstinate
narrow
forehead
where
the
total
absence
of
wrinkles
told
less
of
youth
than
of
complete
lack
of
thought
such
as
she
was
however
heurtebise
loved
and
wooed
her
and
as
he
happened
to
possess
a
small
income
found
no
difficulty
in
winning
her
what
pleased
her
in
this
marriage
was
the
idea
of
wedding
an
author
a
man
who
would
take
her
to
the
theatre
as
often
as
she
wished
as
for
him
i
verily
believe
that
her
sham
elegance
born
of
the
shop
her
pretentious
manners
pursed
up
mouth
and
affectedly
uplifted
little
finger
fascinated
him
and
appeared
to
him
the
height
of
parisian
refinement
for
he
was
born
a
peasant
and
in
spite
of
his
intelligence
remained
one
to
the
end
of
his
days
illustration
tempted
by
a
quiet
happiness
and
the
family
life
of
which
he
had
been
so
long
deprived
heurtebise
spent
two
years
far
from
his
friends
buried
in
the
country
or
in
suburban
nooks
within
easy
distance
of
that
great
city
paris
which
overexcited
him
even
while
he
yet
sought
its
attenuated
atmosphere
just
like
those
invalids
who
are
recommended
sea
air
but
who
too
delicate
to
bear
it
in
all
its
strength
are
compelled
to
inhale
it
from
a
distance
of
some
miles
from
time
to
time
his
name
appeared
in
a
newspaper
or
magazine
at
the
end
of
an
article
but
already
the
freshness
of
style
the
bursts
of
eloquence
were
lacking
by
which
he
had
been
formerly
known
we
thought
he
is
too
happy
his
happiness
has
spoilt
him
however
one
day
he
returned
amongst
us
and
we
immediately
saw
that
he
was
not
happy
his
pallid
countenance
drawn
features
contracted
by
a
perpetual
irritability
the
violent
manners
degenerated
into
a
nervous
rage
the
hollow
sound
of
his
once
fine
ringing
laugh
all
showed
that
he
was
an
altered
man
too
proud
to
admit
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
would
not
complain
but
the
old
friends
who
gathered
round
him
were
soon
convinced
that
he
had
made
a
most
foolish
marriage
and
that
henceforth
his
life
must
prove
a
failure
on
the
other
hand
madame
heurtebise
appeared
to
us
after
two
years
of
married
life
exactly
the
same
as
we
had
beheld
her
in
the
vestry
on
her
wedding
day
she
wore
the
same
calm
and
simpering
smile
she
had
as
much
as
ever
the
air
of
a
shopwoman
in
her
sunday
clothes
only
she
had
gained
she
talked
now
in
the
midst
of
artistic
discussions
into
which
heurtebise
passionately
threw
himself
with
arbitrary
assertions
brutal
contempt
or
blind
enthusiasm
the
false
and
honeyed
voice
of
his
wife
would
suddenly
make
irruption
forcing
him
to
listen
to
some
idle
reasoning
or
foolish
observation
invariably
outside
of
the
subject
of
discussion
embarrassed
and
worried
he
would
cast
us
an
imploring
glance
and
strive
to
resume
the
interrupted
conversation
then
at
last
wearied
out
by
her
familiar
and
constant
contradiction
by
the
silliness
of
her
birdlike
brain
inflated
and
empty
as
any
cracknel
he
held
his
tongue
and
silently
resigned
himself
to
let
her
go
on
to
the
bitter
end
but
this
determined
silence
exasperated
madame
seemed
to
her
more
insulting
more
disdainful
than
anything
her
sharp
voice
became
discordant
and
growing
higher
and
shriller
stung
and
buzzed
like
the
ceaseless
teasing
of
a
fly
till
at
last
her
enraged
husband
in
his
turn
burst
out
brutal
and
terrific
she
emerged
from
these
incessant
quarrels
which
always
ended
in
tears
rested
and
refreshed
as
a
lawn
after
a
watering
but
he
remained
broken
fevered
incapable
of
work
little
by
little
his
very
violence
was
worn
out
one
evening
when
i
was
present
at
one
of
these
odious
scenes
as
madame
heurtebise
triumphantly
left
the
table
i
saw
on
her
husband
face
bent
downwards
during
the
quarrel
and
now
upraised
an
expression
of
scorn
and
anger
that
no
words
could
any
longer
express
the
little
woman
went
off
shutting
the
door
with
a
sharp
snap
and
he
flushed
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
and
his
mouth
distorted
by
an
ironical
and
despairing
smile
made
like
any
behind
his
master
back
an
atrocious
gesture
of
mingled
rage
and
pain
after
a
few
moments
i
heard
him
murmur
in
a
voice
strangled
by
emotion
ah
if
it
were
not
for
the
child
how
i
would
be
off
at
once
for
they
had
a
child
a
poor
little
fellow
handsome
and
dirty
who
crawled
all
over
the
place
played
with
dogs
bigger
than
himself
with
the
spiders
in
the
garden
and
made
his
mother
only
noticed
him
to
declare
him
disgusting
and
that
she
had
not
put
him
out
to
nurse
illustration
she
clung
in
fact
to
all
the
little
shopkeeper
traditions
of
her
youth
and
the
untidy
home
in
which
she
went
about
from
early
morn
in
elaborate
costumes
and
astonishingly
dressed
hair
recalled
the
so
dear
to
her
heart
rooms
black
with
filth
and
want
of
air
where
in
the
short
intervals
of
rest
from
commercial
life
badly
cooked
meals
were
hurriedly
eaten
at
a
bare
wooden
table
listening
all
the
while
for
the
tinkle
of
the
with
this
class
nothing
has
importance
but
the
street
the
street
with
its
passing
purchasers
and
idlers
and
its
overflowing
holiday
crowd
that
on
sundays
throng
the
side
walks
and
pavements
and
how
bored
she
was
wretched
creature
in
the
country
how
she
regretted
the
paris
life
heurtebise
on
the
contrary
required
the
country
for
his
mental
health
paris
still
bewildered
him
like
some
countrified
boor
on
his
first
visit
his
wife
could
not
understand
it
and
bitterly
complained
of
her
exile
by
way
of
diversion
she
invited
her
old
acquaintances
and
when
her
husband
was
absent
they
amused
themselves
by
turning
over
his
papers
his
memoranda
and
the
work
he
was
engaged
upon
do
look
my
dear
how
funny
it
is
he
shuts
himself
up
to
write
this
he
paces
up
and
down
talking
to
himself
as
for
me
i
understand
nothing
of
what
he
does
and
then
came
endless
regrets
and
recollections
of
her
past
life
ah
if
i
had
known
when
i
think
that
i
might
have
married
aubertot
and
fajon
the
she
always
spoke
of
the
two
partners
at
the
same
time
as
though
she
would
have
married
the
firm
neither
did
she
restrain
her
feelings
in
her
husband
presence
illustration
she
disturbed
him
prevented
all
work
settling
down
with
her
friends
in
the
very
room
he
was
writing
in
and
filling
it
with
the
silly
chatter
of
idle
women
who
talked
loud
full
of
disdain
for
a
literary
profession
which
brought
in
so
little
and
whose
most
laborious
hours
always
resemble
a
capricious
idleness
from
time
to
time
heurtebise
strove
to
escape
from
the
life
which
he
felt
was
daily
becoming
more
dismal
he
rushed
off
to
paris
hired
a
small
room
at
an
hotel
tried
to
fancy
he
was
a
bachelor
but
suddenly
he
thought
of
his
son
and
with
a
desperate
longing
to
embrace
him
hurried
back
the
same
evening
into
the
country
illustration
on
these
occasions
in
order
to
avoid
the
inevitable
scene
on
his
return
he
took
a
friend
back
with
him
and
kept
him
there
as
long
as
he
could
as
soon
as
he
was
no
longer
alone
face
to
face
with
his
wife
his
fine
intellect
awoke
and
his
interrupted
schemes
of
work
little
by
little
and
one
after
the
other
came
back
to
him
but
what
anguish
it
was
when
his
friends
left
he
would
have
kept
his
guests
for
ever
clinging
to
them
by
all
the
strength
of
his
with
what
sadness
would
he
accompany
us
to
the
stand
of
the
little
suburban
omnibus
which
bore
us
back
to
paris
and
when
we
left
how
slowly
he
turned
homewards
over
the
dusty
road
with
rounded
shoulders
and
listless
arms
listening
to
the
vanishing
wheels
in
truth
their
life
had
become
unbearable
and
to
avoid
it
he
tried
always
to
keep
his
house
full
with
his
easy
goodnature
his
weariness
and
indifference
he
was
soon
surrounded
by
a
lot
of
literary
starvelings
a
set
of
scribblers
lazy
cracked
settled
down
upon
him
and
became
more
at
home
than
himself
and
as
his
wife
was
but
a
fool
incapable
of
judging
because
they
talked
more
loudly
she
found
them
charming
and
very
superior
to
her
husband
the
days
were
spent
in
idle
discussions
there
was
a
clash
of
empty
words
a
firing
of
smallest
shot
and
poor
heurtebise
motionless
and
silent
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
merely
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
sometimes
however
towards
the
end
of
an
interminable
repast
when
all
his
guests
elbows
on
table
began
around
the
brandy
flasks
one
of
those
lengthy
maundering
conversations
benumbing
like
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
an
immense
feeling
of
disgust
would
seize
hold
of
him
and
not
having
the
courage
to
turn
out
all
these
poor
wretches
he
would
himself
disappear
and
remain
absent
for
a
week
illustration
my
house
is
full
of
imbeciles
he
said
one
day
to
me
i
dare
not
return
with
this
kind
of
existence
he
no
longer
wrote
his
name
was
never
seen
and
his
fortune
squandered
in
a
perpetual
craving
to
have
people
in
his
house
disappeared
in
the
outstretched
hands
around
him
illustration
it
was
a
long
time
since
we
had
met
when
i
received
one
morning
a
line
of
his
dear
little
handwriting
formerly
so
firm
now
trembling
and
uncertain
we
are
in
paris
come
and
see
me
i
am
so
dull
i
found
him
with
his
wife
his
child
and
his
dogs
in
a
lugubrious
little
apartment
in
the
batignolles
the
disorder
which
in
this
narrow
space
could
not
be
spread
about
seemed
more
hideous
even
than
in
the
country
while
the
child
and
dogs
rolled
about
in
rooms
the
size
of
a
chessboard
compartment
heurtebise
who
was
ill
lay
with
his
face
to
the
wall
in
a
state
of
utter
prostration
his
wife
dressed
out
as
usual
and
ever
placid
hardly
looked
at
him
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
him
she
said
to
me
with
a
gesture
of
indifference
on
seeing
me
he
had
for
a
moment
a
return
of
gaiety
and
a
minute
of
his
old
hearty
laugh
but
it
was
soon
stifled
as
they
had
kept
up
in
paris
all
their
suburban
habits
there
appeared
at
the
breakfast
hour
in
the
midst
of
this
household
disorganized
by
poverty
and
illness
a
parasite
a
seedy
looking
little
bald
man
cranky
and
peevish
of
whom
they
always
spoke
as
the
man
who
has
read
proudhon
it
was
thus
that
heurtebise
who
probably
had
never
known
his
name
introduced
him
to
everybody
when
he
was
asked
who
is
that
he
unhesitatingly
replied
oh
a
very
clever
fellow
who
has
thoroughly
studied
proudhon
his
knowledge
was
certainly
not
very
apparent
for
this
deep
thinker
rarely
made
himself
heard
except
to
complain
at
table
of
an
roast
or
a
spoilt
sauce
on
this
occasion
the
man
who
had
read
proudhon
declared
that
the
breakfast
was
detestable
which
however
did
not
prevent
his
devouring
the
larger
half
of
it
himself
how
long
and
lugubrious
this
meal
by
the
bedside
of
my
sick
friend
appeared
to
me
the
wife
gossiped
as
usual
with
a
tap
now
and
then
to
the
child
a
bone
to
the
dogs
and
a
smile
to
the
philosopher
not
once
did
heurtebise
turn
towards
us
and
yet
he
was
not
asleep
i
hardly
know
whether
he
thought
dear
valiant
fellow
in
those
paltry
and
ceaseless
struggles
the
mainspring
of
his
strong
nature
had
broken
and
he
was
already
beginning
to
die
the
silent
death
agony
which
however
was
rather
an
abandonment
of
life
lasted
several
months
and
then
madame
heurtebise
found
herself
a
widow
then
as
no
tears
had
dimmed
her
clear
eyes
as
she
always
bestowed
the
same
care
on
her
glossy
locks
and
as
aubertot
and
fajon
were
still
available
she
married
aubertot
and
fajon
perhaps
it
was
aubertot
perhaps
it
was
fajon
perhaps
even
both
of
them
in
any
case
she
was
able
to
resume
the
life
she
was
fitted
for
and
the
voluble
gossip
and
eternal
smile
of
the
shopwoman
illustration
illustration
the
credo
of
love
to
be
the
wife
of
a
poet
that
had
been
the
dream
of
her
life
but
ruthless
fate
instead
of
the
romantic
and
fevered
existence
she
sighed
for
had
doomed
her
to
a
peaceful
humdrum
happiness
and
married
her
to
a
rich
man
at
auteuil
gentle
and
amiable
perhaps
indeed
a
trifle
old
for
her
possessed
of
but
one
passion
perfectly
inoffensive
and
unexciting
that
of
horticulture
this
excellent
man
spent
his
days
pruning
scissors
in
hand
tending
and
trimming
a
magnificent
collection
of
rose
trees
heating
a
greenhouse
watering
flower
beds
and
really
it
must
be
admitted
that
for
a
poor
little
heart
hungering
after
an
ideal
this
was
hardly
sufficient
food
nevertheless
for
ten
years
her
life
remained
straightforward
and
uniform
like
the
smooth
sanded
paths
in
her
husband
garden
and
she
pursued
it
with
measured
steps
listening
with
resigned
weariness
to
the
dry
and
irritating
sound
of
the
scissors
or
to
the
monotonous
and
endless
showers
that
fell
from
the
watering
pots
on
to
the
leafy
shrubs
the
rabid
horticulturist
bestowed
on
his
wife
the
same
scrupulous
attention
he
gave
to
his
flowers
he
carefully
regulated
the
temperature
of
the
overcrowded
with
nosegays
fearing
for
her
the
april
frosts
or
march
sun
and
like
the
plants
in
pots
that
are
put
out
and
taken
in
at
stated
times
he
made
her
live
methodically
ever
watchful
of
a
change
of
barometer
or
phase
of
the
moon
she
remained
like
this
for
a
long
time
closed
in
by
the
four
walls
of
the
conjugal
garden
innocent
as
a
clematis
full
however
of
wild
aspirations
towards
other
gardens
less
staid
less
humdrum
where
the
rose
trees
would
fling
out
their
branches
untrained
and
the
wild
growth
of
weed
and
briar
be
taller
than
the
trees
and
blossom
with
unknown
and
fantastic
flowers
luxuriantly
coloured
by
a
warmer
sun
such
gardens
are
rarely
found
save
in
the
books
of
poets
and
so
she
read
many
verses
all
unknown
to
the
nurseryman
who
knew
no
other
poetry
than
a
few
almanac
distichs
such
as
quand
il
pleut
à
la
il
pleut
quarante
jours
plus
tard
when
it
rains
on
saint
medard
day
it
rains
on
for
forty
more
days
at
haphazard
the
unfortunate
creature
ravenously
devoured
the
paltriest
rhymes
satisfied
if
she
found
in
them
lines
ending
in
love
and
passion
then
closing
the
book
she
would
spend
hours
dreaming
and
sighing
that
would
have
been
the
husband
for
me
it
is
probable
that
all
this
would
have
remained
in
a
state
of
vague
aspiration
if
at
the
terrible
age
of
thirty
which
seems
to
be
the
decisive
critical
moment
for
woman
virtue
as
twelve
is
for
the
day
beauty
the
irresistible
amaury
had
not
chanced
to
cross
her
path
amaury
was
a
poet
one
of
those
fanatics
in
dress
coat
and
grey
kid
gloves
who
between
ten
and
midnight
go
and
recite
to
the
world
their
ecstasies
of
love
their
raptures
their
despair
leaning
mournfully
against
the
in
the
blaze
of
the
lights
while
seated
around
him
women
in
full
evening
dress
listen
entranced
behind
their
fans
this
one
might
pose
as
the
very
ideal
of
his
kind
with
his
vulgar
but
irresistible
countenance
sunken
eye
pallid
complexion
hair
cut
short
and
moustaches
stiffly
plastered
with
cosmetic
a
desperate
man
such
as
women
love
hopeless
of
life
but
irreproachably
dressed
a
lyric
enthusiast
chilled
and
disheartened
in
whom
the
madness
of
inspiration
can
be
divined
only
in
the
loose
and
neglected
tie
of
his
cravat
but
also
what
success
awaits
him
when
he
delivers
in
a
strident
voice
a
tirade
from
his
poem
the
of
more
especially
the
one
ending
in
this
extraordinary
line
moi
je
crois
à
comme
je
crois
en
dieu
i
believe
in
love
as
i
believe
in
god
illustration
mark
you
i
strongly
suspect
the
rascal
cares
as
little
for
god
as
for
the
rest
but
women
do
not
look
so
closely
they
are
easily
caught
by
a
birdlime
of
words
and
every
time
amaury
recites
his
of
you
are
certain
to
see
all
round
the
rows
upon
rows
of
little
rosy
mouths
eagerly
opening
ready
to
swallow
the
taking
bait
of
mawkish
sentimentality
just
fancy
a
poet
who
has
such
beautiful
moustaches
and
who
believes
in
love
as
he
believes
in
god
for
the
nurseryman
wife
this
proved
indeed
irresistible
in
three
sittings
she
was
conquered
only
as
at
the
bottom
of
this
elegiac
nature
there
was
some
honesty
and
pride
she
would
not
stoop
to
any
paltry
fault
moreover
the
poet
himself
declared
in
his
that
he
only
understood
one
way
of
erring
that
which
was
openly
declared
and
ready
to
defy
both
law
and
society
taking
therefore
the
of
for
her
guide
the
young
woman
one
fine
day
escaped
from
the
garden
at
auteuil
and
went
off
to
throw
herself
into
her
poet
i
can
no
longer
live
with
that
man
take
me
away
in
such
cases
the
husband
is
always
even
when
he
is
a
horticulturist
for
a
moment
amaury
was
staggered
how
on
earth
could
he
have
imagined
that
an
ordinary
little
housewife
of
thirty
would
have
taken
in
earnest
a
love
poem
and
followed
it
out
literally
however
he
put
the
best
face
he
could
on
his
fortune
and
as
the
lady
had
thanks
to
her
little
auteuil
garden
remained
fresh
and
pretty
he
carried
her
off
without
a
murmur
the
first
days
all
was
delightful
they
feared
lest
the
husband
should
track
them
they
thought
it
advisable
to
hide
under
fictitious
names
change
hotels
inhabit
the
most
remote
quarters
of
the
town
the
suburbs
of
paris
the
outlying
districts
illustration
in
the
evening
they
stealthily
sallied
forth
and
took
sentimental
walks
along
the
fortifications
oh
the
wonderful
power
of
romance
the
more
she
was
alarmed
the
more
precautions
window
blinds
and
lowered
veils
were
necessary
the
greater
did
her
poet
seem
at
night
they
opened
the
little
window
of
their
room
and
gazing
at
the
stars
rising
on
high
above
the
signal
lights
of
the
neighbouring
railway
she
made
him
repeat
again
and
again
his
wonderful
verses
moi
je
crois
à
comme
je
crois
en
dieu
and
it
was
delightful
illustration
unfortunately
it
did
not
last
the
husband
left
them
too
much
undisturbed
the
fact
is
was
a
philosopher
his
wife
gone
he
had
closed
the
green
door
of
his
oasis
and
quietly
set
about
trimming
his
roses
again
happy
in
the
thought
that
these
at
least
attached
to
the
soil
by
long
roots
would
not
be
able
to
run
away
from
him
our
reassured
lovers
returned
to
paris
and
then
suddenly
the
young
woman
felt
that
some
change
had
come
over
her
poet
their
flight
fear
of
detection
and
constant
alarms
all
these
things
which
had
fed
her
passion
existing
no
longer
she
began
to
understand
and
see
the
situation
clearly
illustration
moreover
at
every
moment
in
the
settling
of
their
little
household
in
the
thousand
paltry
details
of
every
day
life
the
man
she
was
living
with
showed
himself
more
thoroughly
the
few
and
scarce
generous
heroic
or
delicate
feelings
he
possessed
were
spun
out
in
his
verses
and
he
kept
none
for
his
personal
use
he
was
mean
selfish
above
all
very
niggardly
a
fault
love
seldom
forgives
then
he
had
cut
off
his
moustaches
and
was
disfigured
by
the
loss
how
different
from
that
fine
gloomy
fellow
with
his
carefully
curled
locks
as
he
appeared
one
evening
declaiming
his
in
the
blaze
of
two
chandeliers
now
in
the
enforced
retreat
he
was
undergoing
on
her
account
he
gave
way
to
all
his
crotchets
the
greatest
of
which
was
fancying
himself
always
ill
indeed
from
constantly
playing
at
consumption
one
ends
by
believing
in
it
the
poet
amaury
was
fond
of
decoctions
wrapped
himself
up
in
plaisters
and
covered
his
chimney
piece
with
phials
and
powders
for
some
time
the
little
woman
took
up
quite
seriously
her
part
of
a
nursing
sister
her
devotion
seemed
to
excuse
her
fault
and
give
an
object
to
her
life
but
she
soon
tired
of
it
in
spite
of
herself
in
the
stuffy
room
where
the
poet
sat
wrapped
in
flannel
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
her
little
garden
so
sweetly
scented
and
the
kind
nurseryman
seen
from
afar
in
the
midst
of
his
shrubs
and
flowerbeds
appeared
to
her
as
simple
touching
and
disinterested
as
this
other
one
was
exacting
and
egotistical
at
the
end
of
a
month
she
loved
her
husband
really
loved
him
not
with
the
affection
induced
by
habit
but
with
a
real
and
true
love
one
day
she
wrote
him
a
long
letter
full
of
passion
and
repentance
he
did
not
vouchsafe
a
reply
perhaps
he
thought
she
was
not
yet
sufficiently
punished
then
she
despatched
letter
after
letter
humbled
herself
begged
him
to
allow
her
to
return
saying
she
would
die
rather
than
continue
to
live
with
that
man
it
was
now
the
lover
turn
to
be
called
that
man
strange
to
say
she
hid
herself
from
him
to
write
for
she
believed
him
still
in
love
and
while
imploring
her
forgiveness
she
feared
the
exaltation
of
her
lover
he
will
never
allow
me
to
leave
she
said
to
herself
accordingly
when
by
dint
of
supplications
she
obtained
forgiveness
and
the
nurseryman
i
have
already
mentioned
that
he
was
a
philosopher
consented
to
take
her
back
the
return
to
her
own
home
bore
all
the
mysterious
and
dramatic
aspect
of
flight
she
literally
eloped
with
her
husband
it
was
her
last
culpable
pleasure
one
evening
as
the
poet
tired
of
their
dual
existence
and
proud
of
his
regrown
moustaches
had
gone
to
an
evening
party
to
recite
his
of
she
jumped
into
a
cab
that
was
awaiting
her
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
returned
with
her
old
husband
to
the
little
garden
at
auteuil
for
ever
cured
of
her
ambition
to
be
the
wife
of
a
poet
it
is
true
that
this
fellow
was
not
much
of
a
poet
illustration
the
transteverina
the
play
was
just
over
and
while
the
crowd
with
its
many
varied
impressions
hurried
away
and
poured
out
under
the
glare
of
the
principal
portico
of
the
theatre
a
few
friends
of
whom
i
was
one
awaited
the
poet
at
the
artists
entrance
in
order
to
congratulate
him
his
production
had
not
indeed
been
very
successful
too
powerful
to
suit
the
timid
and
trivial
imagination
of
the
public
of
our
day
it
was
quite
beyond
the
range
of
the
stage
limited
as
that
is
by
conventionalities
and
tolerated
traditions
pedantic
criticism
declared
it
is
not
fit
for
the
stage
and
the
scoffers
of
the
boulevards
revenged
themselves
for
the
emotion
these
magnificent
verses
had
given
them
by
repeating
it
wo
pay
as
for
us
we
were
proud
of
the
friend
who
had
dared
to
roll
forth
in
a
ringing
peal
his
splendid
golden
rhymes
flashing
the
best
product
of
his
genius
beneath
the
artificial
and
murderous
light
of
the
lustres
and
presenting
his
personages
in
size
heedless
of
the
optical
illusion
of
the
modern
stage
of
the
dimness
of
and
defective
vision
amid
a
motley
crowd
of
scene
shifters
firemen
and
muffled
up
in
comforters
the
poet
approached
us
his
tall
figure
bent
double
his
coat
collar
chillily
turned
up
over
his
thin
beard
and
long
grizzled
hair
he
seemed
depressed
the
scant
applause
of
the
hired
claque
and
literary
friends
confined
to
a
corner
of
the
house
foretold
a
limited
number
of
representations
choice
and
rare
spectators
and
posters
rapidly
replaced
without
giving
his
name
a
chance
of
being
known
when
one
has
worked
twenty
of
talent
and
life
this
obstinate
refusal
of
the
public
to
comprehend
is
wearying
and
disheartening
and
one
ends
by
thinking
perhaps
after
all
they
are
right
fear
paralyses
and
words
fail
our
acclamations
and
enthusiastic
greetings
somewhat
cheered
him
really
do
you
think
so
is
it
well
done
is
true
i
have
given
all
i
knew
and
his
feverish
hands
anxiously
clutched
ours
his
eyes
full
of
tears
sought
a
sincere
and
reassuring
glance
it
was
the
imploring
anguish
of
the
sick
person
asking
the
doctor
it
is
not
true
not
going
to
die
no
poet
you
will
not
die
the
operettas
and
fairy
pieces
that
have
had
hundreds
of
representations
and
thousands
of
spectators
will
be
long
since
forgotten
scattered
to
the
winds
with
their
last
playbills
while
your
work
will
ever
remain
fresh
and
living
as
we
stood
on
the
now
deserted
pavement
exhorting
and
cheering
him
a
loud
contralto
voice
vulgarised
by
an
italian
accent
burst
upon
us
hullo
artist
enough
let
go
and
eat
the
illustration
at
the
same
moment
a
stout
woman
wrapped
up
in
a
hooded
cape
and
a
red
tartan
shawl
linked
her
arm
in
that
of
our
friend
in
a
manner
so
brutal
and
despotic
that
his
countenance
and
attitude
became
at
once
embarrassed
my
wife
he
said
then
turning
towards
her
with
a
hesitating
smile
suppose
we
take
them
home
and
show
them
how
you
make
an
flattered
in
the
conceit
of
her
culinary
accomplishments
the
italian
graciously
consented
to
receive
us
and
five
or
six
of
us
started
off
for
the
heights
of
montmartre
where
they
dwelt
to
share
their
stewed
beef
i
confess
i
took
a
certain
interest
in
the
artist
home
life
since
his
marriage
our
friend
had
led
a
very
secluded
existence
almost
always
in
the
country
but
what
i
knew
of
his
life
whetted
my
curiosity
fifteen
years
before
when
in
all
the
freshness
of
a
romantic
imagination
he
had
met
in
the
suburbs
of
rome
a
magnificent
creature
with
whom
he
immediately
fell
desperately
in
love
maria
assunta
her
father
and
a
brood
of
brothers
and
sisters
inhabited
one
of
those
little
houses
of
the
transtevera
with
walls
uprising
from
the
waters
of
the
tiber
and
an
old
fishing
boat
rocking
level
with
the
door
one
day
he
caught
sight
of
the
handsome
italian
girl
with
bare
feet
in
the
sand
red
skirt
tightly
pleated
around
her
and
unbleached
linen
sleeves
tucked
up
to
the
shoulders
catching
eels
out
of
a
large
gleaming
wet
net
the
silvery
scales
glistening
through
the
meshes
full
of
water
the
golden
river
and
scarlet
petticoat
the
beautiful
black
eyes
deep
and
pensive
which
seemed
darkened
in
their
musing
by
the
surrounding
sunlight
struck
the
artist
perhaps
even
rather
trivially
like
some
coloured
print
on
the
titlepage
of
a
song
in
a
window
illustration
it
so
chanced
that
the
girl
was
having
till
now
bestowed
her
affections
on
a
big
yellow
and
sly
also
a
great
fisher
of
eels
who
bristled
up
all
over
when
anyone
approached
his
mistress
illustration
beasts
and
men
our
lover
managed
to
tame
all
these
folk
was
married
at
of
the
transtevera
and
brought
back
to
france
the
beautiful
assunta
and
her
ah
poor
fellow
he
ought
also
to
have
brought
away
at
the
same
time
some
of
the
sunlight
of
that
country
a
scrap
of
the
blue
sky
the
eccentric
costume
and
the
bulrushes
of
the
tiber
and
the
large
swing
nets
of
the
in
fact
the
frame
with
the
picture
then
he
would
have
been
spared
the
cruel
disenchantment
he
experienced
when
having
settled
in
a
modest
flat
on
the
fourth
storey
on
the
heights
of
montmartre
he
saw
his
handsome
transteverina
decked
out
in
a
crinoline
a
flounced
dress
and
a
parisian
bonnet
which
constantly
out
of
balance
on
the
top
of
her
heavy
braids
assumed
the
most
independent
attitudes
under
the
clear
cold
light
of
parisian
skies
the
unfortunate
man
soon
perceived
that
his
wife
was
a
fool
an
irretrievable
fool
not
a
single
idea
even
lurked
in
the
velvety
depths
of
those
beautiful
black
eyes
lost
in
infinite
contemplation
they
glittered
like
an
in
the
calm
of
digestion
or
in
a
chance
gleam
of
light
nothing
more
withal
the
lady
was
common
vulgar
accustomed
to
govern
by
a
slap
all
the
little
world
of
her
native
hut
and
the
least
opposition
threw
her
into
uncontrollable
rages
who
would
have
guessed
that
the
fine
mouth
straitened
by
silence
into
the
purest
shape
of
an
antique
face
would
suddenly
open
to
let
flow
torrents
of
vulgar
abuse
without
respect
for
herself
or
for
him
out
loud
in
the
street
at
the
theatre
she
would
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
and
indulge
in
scenes
of
fearful
jealousy
to
crown
all
devoid
of
any
artistic
feeling
she
was
completely
ignorant
of
her
profession
and
language
of
manners
in
fact
of
everything
the
little
french
she
could
be
taught
only
made
her
forget
italian
and
the
result
was
that
she
composed
a
kind
of
half
and
half
jargon
which
had
the
most
comical
effect
in
short
this
love
story
begun
like
one
of
poems
was
ending
like
a
novel
of
champfleury
after
having
for
a
long
time
struggled
to
civilise
this
wild
woman
the
poet
saw
he
must
abandon
the
task
too
honourable
to
leave
her
probably
still
too
much
in
love
he
made
up
his
mind
to
shut
himself
up
see
no
one
and
work
hard
the
few
intimate
friends
he
admitted
to
his
house
saw
that
they
embarrassed
him
and
ceased
to
come
illustration
hence
it
was
that
for
the
last
fifteen
years
he
had
been
living
boxed
up
in
his
household
like
in
a
leper
cell
as
i
pondered
over
this
wretched
existence
i
watched
the
strange
couple
walking
before
me
he
slender
tall
and
illustration
she
squarely
built
heavy
shaking
her
shawl
by
an
impatient
shrug
of
her
shoulders
with
a
free
gait
like
a
man
she
was
tolerably
cheerful
her
speech
was
loud
and
from
time
to
time
she
turned
round
to
see
if
we
followed
familiarly
shouting
and
calling
by
name
those
of
us
she
happened
to
know
accentuating
her
words
by
much
gesticulation
as
she
would
have
hailed
a
fishing
boat
on
the
tiber
when
we
reached
their
house
the
furious
at
seeing
so
noisy
a
crew
at
such
an
unearthly
hour
tried
to
prevent
our
entry
the
italian
and
he
had
a
fearful
row
on
the
staircase
we
were
all
dotted
about
on
the
winding
stairs
dimly
lighted
by
the
dying
gas
ill
at
ease
uncomfortable
hardly
knowing
if
we
ought
not
to
come
down
again
come
quick
let
us
go
up
said
the
poet
in
a
low
tone
and
we
followed
him
silently
while
leaning
over
the
banisters
that
shook
under
her
weight
and
anger
the
italian
let
fly
a
volley
of
abuse
in
which
roman
imprecations
alternated
with
the
vocabulary
of
the
back
slums
what
a
return
home
for
the
poet
who
had
just
roused
the
admiration
of
artistic
paris
and
still
retained
in
his
fevered
eyes
the
dazzling
intoxication
of
his
first
performance
what
a
humiliating
recall
to
life
it
was
only
by
the
fireside
in
his
little
sitting
room
that
the
icy
chill
caused
by
this
silly
adventure
was
dispelled
and
we
should
soon
have
completely
forgotten
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
piercing
voice
and
bursts
of
laughter
of
the
signora
whom
we
heard
in
the
kitchen
telling
her
maid
how
soundly
she
had
rated
that
when
the
table
was
laid
and
supper
ready
she
came
and
seated
herself
amongst
us
having
taken
off
her
shawl
bonnet
and
veil
and
i
was
able
to
examine
her
at
my
leisure
she
was
no
longer
handsome
the
square
face
the
broad
heavy
jaw
the
coarse
hair
turning
grey
and
above
all
the
vulgar
expression
of
the
mouth
contrasted
singularly
with
the
eternal
and
meaningless
reverie
of
the
dreamy
gaze
resting
her
elbows
on
the
table
familiar
and
shapeless
she
joined
in
the
conversation
without
for
an
instant
losing
sight
of
her
plate
just
over
her
head
proud
amid
all
the
melancholy
rubbish
of
the
a
large
portrait
signed
by
an
illustrious
name
stood
out
of
the
surrounding
shade
it
was
maria
assunta
at
twenty
the
purple
costume
the
milky
white
of
the
pleated
wimple
the
bright
gold
of
the
imitation
jewelry
set
off
magnificently
the
brilliancy
of
a
sunny
complexion
the
velvety
shades
of
the
thick
hair
growing
low
on
the
forehead
which
seemed
to
be
united
by
an
almost
imperceptible
down
to
the
superb
and
straight
line
of
the
eyebrows
how
could
such
an
exuberance
of
life
and
beauty
have
deteriorated
and
become
such
a
mass
of
vulgarity
and
curiously
while
the
transteverina
talked
i
interrogated
her
lovely
eyes
so
deep
and
soft
on
the
canvas
illustration
the
excitement
of
the
meal
had
put
her
in
a
good
humour
to
cheer
up
the
poet
to
whom
his
mingled
failure
and
glory
were
doubly
painful
she
thumped
him
on
the
back
laughed
with
her
mouth
full
saying
in
her
hideous
jargon
that
it
was
not
worth
while
for
such
a
trifle
to
fling
oneself
head
downwards
from
the
del
illustration
is
it
true
cato
she
added
turning
to
the
old
crippled
by
rheumatism
snoring
in
front
of
the
fire
then
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
an
interesting
discussion
she
screamed
out
to
her
husband
in
a
voice
senseless
and
brutal
as
the
crack
of
a
rifle
hey
artist
lampo
qui
filo
the
poor
fellow
immediately
interrupted
his
conversation
to
wind
up
the
lamp
humble
submissive
anxious
to
avoid
the
scene
he
dreaded
and
which
in
spite
of
all
he
did
not
escape
on
returning
from
the
theatre
we
had
stopped
at
the
to
get
a
bottle
of
choice
wine
to
wash
down
the
all
along
the
road
maria
assunta
had
piously
carried
it
under
her
shawl
and
on
her
arrival
she
had
placed
it
on
the
table
where
she
could
cast
tender
looks
upon

timidly
bending
down

he
whispered

frightened

soon
all
paris
knew
their
love
and
became
interested
in
it
it
was
the
wonder
of
the
season
the
world
came
to
admire
the
two
splendid
stars
gently
gravitating
towards
each
other
in
the
musical
firmament
of
the
opera
house
at
last
one
evening
after
an
enthusiastic
recall
as
the
curtain
fell
separating
the
house
full
of
noisy
applause
and
the
stage
littered
with
bouquets
where
the
white
gown
of
juliet
swept
over
scattered
camellia
blossoms
the
two
singers
were
seized
with
an
irresistible
impulse
as
though
their
love
a
shade
artificial
had
but
awaited
the
emotion
of
a
splendid
success
to
reveal
itself
illustration
hands
were
clasped
vows
exchanged
vows
consecrated
by
the
distant
and
persistent
plaudits
of
the
house
the
two
stars
had
made
their
conjunction
after
the
wedding
some
time
passed
before
they
were
again
seen
on
the
stage
then
when
their
holiday
was
ended
they
reappeared
in
the
same
piece
this
reappearance
was
a
revelation
until
then
of
the
two
singers
the
man
had
been
the
most
prized
older
and
more
accustomed
to
the
public
whose
foibles
and
preferences
he
had
studied
he
held
the
pit
and
boxes
under
the
spell
of
his
voice
beside
him
the
other
one
seemed
but
an
admirably
gifted
pupil
the
promise
of
a
future
genius
but
her
voice
was
young
and
had
angles
in
it
just
as
her
shoulders
were
too
slight
and
thin
and
when
on
her
return
she
appeared
in
one
of
her
former
parts
and
the
full
rich
powerful
sound
poured
out
in
the
very
first
notes
abundant
and
pure
like
the
water
of
some
sparkling
spring
there
ran
through
the
house
such
a
thrill
of
delight
and
surprise
that
all
the
interest
of
the
evening
was
concentrated
on
her
for
the
young
woman
it
was
one
of
those
happy
days
in
which
the
ambient
atmosphere
becomes
limpid
light
and
vibrating
wafting
towards
one
all
the
radiance
and
adulations
of
success
as
for
the
husband
they
almost
forgot
to
applaud
him
and
as
a
dazzling
light
ever
seems
to
make
the
shade
around
it
darker
so
he
found
himself
relegated
as
it
were
to
the
most
insignificant
part
of
the
stage
as
if
he
were
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
mere
walking
gentleman
after
all
the
passion
that
was
revealed
in
the
songstress
acting
in
her
voice
full
of
charm
and
tenderness
was
inspired
by
him
he
alone
lent
fire
to
the
glances
of
those
deep
eyes
and
that
idea
ought
to
have
made
him
proud
but
the
comedian
vanity
proved
stronger
at
the
end
of
the
performance
he
sent
for
the
leader
of
the
and
rated
him
soundly
they
had
missed
his
entry
and
his
exit
forgotten
the
recall
at
the
third
act
he
would
complain
to
the
manager
alas
in
vain
he
struggled
in
vain
did
the
paid
applause
greet
him
the
good
graces
of
the
public
henceforth
bestowed
on
his
wife
remained
definitively
acquired
to
her
she
was
fortunate
too
in
a
choice
of
parts
appropriate
to
her
talent
and
her
beauty
in
which
she
appeared
with
all
the
assurance
of
a
woman
of
the
world
entering
a
dressed
in
the
colours
best
suited
to
her
and
certain
of
an
ovation
at
each
fresh
success
the
husband
was
depressed
nervous
and
irritable
this
vogue
which
left
him
and
so
absolutely
became
hers
only
seemed
to
him
a
kind
of
robbery
for
a
long
while
he
strove
to
hide
from
every
one
more
especially
from
his
wife
this
unavowable
anguish
but
one
evening
as
she
was
going
up
the
stairs
leading
to
her
holding
up
with
both
hands
her
with
bouquets
carried
away
by
her
triumphal
success
she
said
to
him
with
a
voice
still
overcome
by
the
excitement
of
applause
we
have
had
a
magnificent
house
he
replied
you
think
so
in
such
an
ironical
and
bitter
tone
that
the
young
wife
suddenly
understood
all
her
husband
was
jealous
not
with
the
jealousy
of
a
lover
who
will
only
allow
his
wife
to
be
beautiful
for
him
but
with
the
jealousy
of
an
artist
cold
furious
implacable
at
times
when
she
stopped
at
the
end
of
an
air
and
multitudes
of
bravos
were
thrown
to
her
from
outstretched
hands
he
affected
an
indifferent
and
absent
manner
and
his
listless
gaze
seemed
to
say
to
the
spectators
when
you
have
finished
applauding
i
sing
ah
the
applause
that
sound
like
hail
reechoing
so
delightfully
through
the
lobbies
the
house
and
the
side
scenes
once
the
sweets
of
it
are
tasted
it
is
impossible
to
live
without
it
great
actors
do
not
die
of
illness
or
old
age
they
cease
to
exist
when
applause
no
longer
greets
them
at
the
indifference
of
the
public
this
one
was
really
seized
with
a
feeling
of
despair
he
grew
thin
became
peevish
and
in
vain
did
he
reason
with
himself
look
his
incurable
folly
well
in
the
face
repeat
to
himself
before
he
came
on
the
stage
and
yet
she
is
my
wife
and
i
love
her
in
the
artificial
atmosphere
of
the
stage
the
true
sentiment
of
life
vanished
at
once
he
still
loved
the
wife
but
detested
the
singer
she
realized
it
and
as
one
nurses
an
invalid
watched
the
sad
mania
at
first
she
thought
of
lessening
her
success
of
making
a
sparing
use
and
not
giving
the
full
power
of
her
voice
and
talent
but
her
resolutions
like
those
of
her
husband
could
not
withstand
the
glare
of
the
footlights
her
talent
almost
unconsciously
overstepped
her
will
then
she
humbled
herself
before
him
belittled
herself
she
asked
his
advice
inquired
if
he
thought
her
interpretation
correct
if
he
understood
the
part
in
that
way
of
course
he
was
never
satisfied
with
assumed
goodnature
in
the
tone
of
false
friendship
that
comedians
use
so
much
amongst
each
other
he
would
say
on
the
evenings
of
her
greatest
successes
you
must
watch
yourself
dear
you
are
not
doing
very
well
just
now
not
improving
at
other
times
he
tried
to
prevent
her
singing
take
care
you
are
lavishing
yourself
you
are
doing
too
much
wear
out
your
luck
believe
me
you
ought
to
take
a
holiday
he
even
condescended
to
the
most
paltry
pretexts
said
she
had
a
cold
was
not
in
good
voice
or
else
he
would
try
to
pick
some
mean
stage
quarrel
you
took
up
the
end
of
the
duet
too
quickly
you
spoilt
my
effect
you
did
it
on
purpose
he
never
saw
poor
wretch
that
it
was
he
who
hindered
her
bye
play
hurrying
on
with
his
cue
in
order
to
prevent
any
applause
and
in
his
anxiety
to
regain
the
public
ear
monopolizing
the
front
of
the
stage
leaving
his
wife
in
the
background
she
never
complained
for
she
loved
him
too
well
moreover
success
makes
us
indulgent
and
every
evening
she
was
compelled
to
quit
the
shade
in
which
she
strove
to
conceal
and
efface
herself
to
obey
the
summons
enthusiastically
calling
her
to
the
footlights
this
singular
jealousy
was
soon
noticed
at
the
theatre
and
their
fellow
actors
made
fun
of
it
they
overwhelmed
the
singer
with
compliments
about
his
wife
singing
they
thrust
under
his
eyes
the
newspaper
article
in
which
after
four
long
columns
devoted
to
the
star
the
critic
bestowed
a
few
lines
to
the
fast
fading
vogue
of
the
husband
one
day
having
just
read
one
of
these
articles
he
rushed
into
his
wife
holding
the
open
paper
in
his
hand
and
said
to
her
pale
with
rage
the
fellow
must
have
been
your
lover
he
had
indeed
reached
this
degree
of
injustice
in
fact
the
unhappy
woman
praised
and
envied
whose
name
figured
in
large
type
on
the
play
bills
and
might
be
read
on
all
the
walls
of
paris
who
was
seized
upon
as
a
successful
advertising
medium
and
placed
on
the
tiny
gilt
labels
of
the
confectioner
or
perfumer
led
the
saddest
and
most
humiliating
of
lives
she
dared
not
open
a
paper
for
fear
of
reading
her
own
praises
wept
over
the
flowers
that
were
thrown
to
her
and
which
she
left
to
die
in
a
corner
of
her
that
she
might
avoid
perpetuating
at
home
the
cruel
memories
of
her
triumphant
evenings
she
even
wanted
to
quit
the
stage
but
her
husband
objected
illustration
it
will
be
said
that
i
make
you
leave
it
and
the
horrible
torture
continued
for
both
one
night
of
a
first
representation
the
songstress
was
going
to
the
front
when
somebody
said
to
her
mind
what
you
are
about
there
is
a
cabal
in
the
house
against
you
she
laughed
at
the
idea
a
cabal
against
her
and
for
what
reason
good
heavens
she
who
only
met
with
sympathy
who
did
not
belong
to
any
coterie
it
was
true
however
in
the
middle
of
the
opera
in
a
grand
duet
with
her
husband
at
the
moment
when
her
magnificent
voice
had
reached
the
highest
pitch
of
its
compass
finishing
the
sound
in
a
succession
of
notes
even
and
pure
like
the
rounded
pearls
of
a
necklace
a
volley
of
hisses
cut
her
short
the
audience
was
as
much
moved
and
surprised
as
herself
all
remained
breathless
as
though
each
one
felt
prisoner
within
them
the
passage
she
had
not
been
able
to
finish
suddenly
a
horrible
mad
idea
flashed
across
her
mind
he
was
alone
on
the
stage
in
front
of
her
she
gazed
at
him
steadily
and
saw
in
his
eyes
the
passing
gleam
of
a
cruel
smile
the
poor
woman
understood
all
sobs
suffocated
her
she
could
only
burst
into
tears
and
blindly
disappear
through
the
crowded
side
scenes
it
was
her
own
husband
who
had
had
her
hissed
illustration

a
misunderstanding
the

version
what
can
be
the
matter
with
him
what
can
he
complain
of
i
can
not
understand
it
and
yet
i
have
done
all
i
could
to
make
him
happy
to
be
sure
i
do
say
that
instead
of
a
poet
i
would
not
rather
have
married
a
notary
or
a
lawyer
something
rather
more
serious
rather
less
vague
as
a
profession
nevertheless
such
as
he
was
he
took
my
fancy
i
thought
him
a
trifle
visionary
but
charming
all
the
same
and
besides
he
had
some
fortune
and
i
thought
that
once
married
poetizing
would
not
prevent
him
from
seeking
out
some
good
appointment
which
would
set
us
quite
at
ease
illustration
illustration
he
too
at
that
time
seemed
to
find
me
to
his
taste
when
he
came
to
see
me
at
my
aunt
in
the
country
he
could
not
find
words
enough
to
admire
the
order
and
arrangement
of
our
little
house
kept
like
a
convent
it
is
so
quaint
he
used
to
say
he
would
laugh
and
call
me
all
sorts
of
names
taken
from
the
poems
and
romances
he
had
read
that
shocked
me
a
little
i
confess
i
should
have
liked
him
to
be
more
serious
but
it
was
not
until
we
were
married
and
settled
in
paris
that
i
felt
all
the
difference
of
our
two
natures
i
had
dreamed
of
a
little
home
kept
scrupulously
bright
and
clean
instead
of
which
he
began
at
once
to
encumber
our
apartment
with
useless
furniture
covered
with
dust
and
with
faded
tapestries
old
as
the
hills
in
everything
it
was
the
same
would
you
believe
that
he
obliged
me
to
put
away
in
the
attic
a
sweetly
pretty
empire
clock
which
had
come
to
me
from
my
aunt
and
some
pictures
given
me
by
my
school
friends
he
thought
them
hideous
i
am
still
wondering
why
for
after
all
his
study
was
one
mass
of
lumber
of
old
smoky
pictures
statuettes
i
blushed
to
look
at
chipped
antiquities
of
all
kinds
good
for
nothing
vases
that
would
not
hold
water
odd
cups
chandeliers
covered
with
verdigris
illustration
by
the
side
of
my
beautiful
rosewood
piano
he
had
put
another
a
little
shabby
thing
with
all
the
polish
off
notes
wanting
and
so
old
and
worn
that
one
could
hardly
hear
it
i
began
to
think
good
gracious
is
an
artist
then
really
a
little
mad
does
he
only
care
for
useless
things
and
despise
all
that
is
useful
when
i
saw
his
friends
the
society
he
received
it
was
still
worse
men
with
long
hair
great
beards
scarcely
combed
badly
dressed
who
did
not
hesitate
to
smoke
in
my
presence
while
to
listen
to
them
made
me
quite
uncomfortable
so
widely
opposed
were
their
ideas
to
mine
they
used
long
words
fine
phrases
nothing
natural
nothing
simple
then
with
all
this
not
a
notion
of
ordinary
civilities
you
might
ask
them
to
dinner
twenty
times
running
and
there
would
be
never
a
call
never
a
return
of
any
kind
not
even
a
card
or
a
bonbon
on
new
year
day
nothing
some
of
these
gentry
were
married
and
brought
their
wives
to
see
us
you
should
have
seen
the
style
of
these
persons
for
every
day
wear
superb
toilettes
such
as
thank
heaven
i
would
wear
at
no
time
and
so
without
order
or
method
hair
loose
skirts
trailing
and
such
a
bold
display
of
their
talents
there
were
some
who
sang
like
actresses
played
the
piano
like
professors
all
talked
on
every
subject
just
like
men
i
ask
you
is
this
reasonable
ought
serious
women
once
married
to
think
of
anything
but
the
care
of
their
household
this
is
what
i
tried
to
make
my
husband
understand
when
he
was
vexed
at
seeing
me
give
up
my
music
music
is
all
very
well
when
one
is
a
little
girl
and
has
nothing
better
to
do
but
candidly
i
should
consider
myself
very
ridiculous
if
i
sat
down
every
day
to
the
piano
illustration
oh
i
am
quite
aware
that
his
great
complaint
against
me
is
that
i
wished
to
draw
him
from
the
strange
society
i
considered
so
dangerous
for
him
you
have
driven
away
all
my
friends
he
often
used
to
say
reproachfully
yes
i
did
do
so
and
i
do
regret
it
those
creatures
would
have
ended
by
driving
him
crazy
after
leaving
them
he
would
often
spend
the
night
in
making
rhymes
and
in
marching
up
and
down
and
talking
aloud
as
if
he
were
not
already
sufficiently
eccentric
and
original
in
himself
without
being
excited
by
others
what
caprices
what
whims
have
i
not
put
up
with
suddenly
one
morning
he
would
appear
in
my
room
quick
get
your
hat
we
are
off
to
the
country
then
one
must
leave
everything
sewing
household
affairs
take
a
carriage
go
by
rail
spend
a
mint
of
money
and
i
who
only
thought
of
economy
for
after
all
it
is
not
with
fifteen
thousand
francs
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
that
one
can
be
counted
rich
in
paris
or
make
any
provision
for
one
children
at
first
he
used
to
laugh
at
my
observations
and
try
to
make
me
laugh
then
when
he
saw
how
firmly
i
was
resolved
to
remain
serious
he
found
fault
with
my
simplicity
and
my
taste
for
home
am
i
to
blame
because
i
detest
theatres
and
concerts
and
those
artistic
soirées
to
which
he
wished
to
drag
me
and
where
he
met
his
old
acquaintances
a
lot
of
scatterbrains
dissipated
and
bohemian
at
one
time
i
thought
he
was
becoming
more
reasonable
i
had
managed
to
him
from
his
circle
of
friends
and
to
gather
round
us
a
society
of
sensible
people
in
life
who
might
be
of
use
to
us
but
no
monsieur
was
bored
he
was
always
bored
from
morning
till
night
at
our
little
soirees
where
i
was
careful
to
arrange
a
whist
table
and
a
tea
table
all
as
it
should
be
he
would
appear
with
such
a
face
in
such
a
temper
when
we
were
alone
it
was
just
the
same
nevertheless
i
was
full
of
little
attentions
i
used
to
say
to
him
read
me
something
of
what
you
are
doing
he
recited
to
me
verses
tirades
of
which
i
understood
nothing
but
i
put
on
an
air
of
interest
and
here
and
there
made
some
little
remark
which
by
the
way
inevitably
had
the
knack
of
annoying
him
in
a
year
working
night
and
day
he
could
only
make
of
all
his
rhymes
one
single
volume
which
never
sold
i
said
to
him
ah
you
see
just
in
a
reasoning
spirit
to
bring
him
to
something
more
comprehensible
more
remunerative
he
got
into
a
frightful
rage
and
afterwards
sank
into
a
state
of
gloomy
depression
which
made
me
very
unhappy
my
friends
advised
me
as
well
as
they
could
you
see
my
dear
it
is
the
ennui
and
bad
temper
of
an
unoccupied
man
if
he
worked
a
little
more
he
would
not
be
so
gloomy
then
i
set
to
work
and
all
my
belongings
too
to
seek
him
an
appointment
i
moved
heaven
and
earth
i
made
i
do
know
how
many
visits
to
the
wives
of
government
officials
heads
of
departments
i
even
penetrated
into
a
minister
office
it
was
a
surprise
i
reserved
for
him
i
said
to
we
shall
see
whether
he
will
be
pleased
this
time
at
length
the
day
when
i
received
his
nomination
in
a
lovely
envelope
with
five
big
seals
i
carried
it
myself
to
his
table
half
wild
with
joy
it
was
provision
for
the
future
comfort
self
content
the
tranquillity
of
regular
work
do
you
know
what
he
did
he
said
he
would
never
forgive
me
after
which
he
tore
the
letter
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
rushed
out
banging
the
doors
oh
these
artists
poor
unsettled
brains
taking
life
all
the
wrong
way
what
could
be
done
with
such
a
man
i
should
have
liked
to
talk
to
him
to
reason
with
him
in
vain
those
were
indeed
right
who
had
said
to
me
he
is
a
madman
of
what
use
moreover
to
talk
to
him
we
do
not
speak
the
same
language
he
would
not
understand
me
any
more
than
i
understand
him
and
now
here
we
must
sit
and
look
at
each
other
i
see
hatred
in
his
glance
and
yet
i
have
true
affection
for
him
it
is
very
painful
a
misunderstanding
the
husband
version
i
had
thought
of
everything
taken
all
my
precautions
i
would
not
have
a
parisian
because
parisian
women
alarm
me
i
would
not
have
a
rich
wife
because
she
might
be
too
exacting
and
extravagant
i
also
dreaded
family
ties
that
terrible
network
of
homely
affections
which
monopolizes
imprisons
dwarfs
and
stifles
my
wife
was
the
realization
of
my
fondest
dreams
i
said
to
myself
she
will
owe
me
everything
illustration
what
pleasure
to
educate
this
simple
mind
to
the
contemplation
of
beauty
to
initiate
this
pure
soul
to
my
enthusiasms
and
hopes
to
give
life
in
short
to
this
statue
the
fact
is
she
had
the
air
of
a
statue
with
her
great
serious
calm
eyes
her
regular
greek
profile
her
features
which
although
rather
too
marked
and
severe
were
softened
by
the
bloom
of
youth
and
the
shadow
of
the
waving
hair
added
to
all
this
was
a
faint
provincial
accent
that
was
my
especial
joy
an
accent
to
which
with
closed
eyes
i
listened
as
a
recollection
of
happy
childhood
the
echo
of
a
tranquil
life
in
some
far
away
utterly
unknown
nook
and
to
think
that
now
this
accent
has
become
unbearable
to
me
but
in
those
days
i
had
faith
i
loved
i
was
happy
and
disposed
to
be
still
more
so
full
of
ardour
for
my
work
i
had
as
soon
as
i
was
married
begun
a
new
poem
and
in
the
evening
i
read
to
her
the
verses
of
the
day
i
wished
to
make
her
enter
completely
into
my
existence
the
first
time
or
two
she
said
to
me
very
pretty
and
i
was
grateful
to
her
for
this
childish
approbation
hoping
that
in
time
she
would
comprehend
better
what
was
the
very
breath
of
my
life
poor
creature
how
i
must
have
bored
her
after
having
read
her
my
verses
i
explained
them
to
her
seeking
in
her
beautiful
astonished
eyes
the
gleam
of
light
ever
fancying
i
should
surprise
it
illustration
i
obliged
her
to
give
me
her
opinion
and
i
passed
over
all
that
was
foolish
to
retain
only
what
a
chance
inspiration
might
contain
of
good
i
so
longed
to
make
of
her
my
true
help
mate
the
real
artist
wife
but
no
she
could
not
understand
in
vain
did
i
read
to
her
the
great
poets
choosing
the
strongest
the
tenderest
the
golden
rhymes
of
the
love
poems
fell
upon
her
ear
as
coldly
and
tediously
as
a
hailstorm
once
i
remember
we
were
reading
nuit
she
interrupted
me
to
ask
for
something
more
serious
i
tried
then
to
explain
to
her
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
more
serious
than
poetry
which
is
the
very
essence
of
life
floating
above
it
like
a
glory
of
light
in
the
vibrations
of
which
words
and
thoughts
are
elevated
and
transfigured
oh
what
a
disdainful
smile
passed
over
her
pretty
mouth
and
what
condescension
in
her
glance
as
though
a
child
or
a
madman
had
spoken
to
her
what
have
i
not
thus
wasted
of
strength
and
useless
eloquence
nothing
was
of
any
use
i
stumbled
perpetually
against
what
she
called
good
sense
reason
that
eternal
excuse
of
dried
up
hearts
and
narrow
minds
and
it
was
not
only
poetry
that
bored
her
before
our
marriage
i
had
believed
her
to
be
a
musician
she
seemed
to
understand
the
pieces
she
played
aided
by
the
underlinings
of
her
teacher
scarcely
was
she
married
when
she
closed
her
piano
and
gave
up
her
music
illustration
can
there
be
anything
more
melancholy
than
this
abandonment
by
the
young
wife
of
all
that
had
pleased
in
the
young
girl
the
reply
given
the
part
ended
the
actress
quits
her
costume
it
was
all
done
with
a
view
to
marriage
a
surface
of
petty
accomplishments
of
pretty
smiles
and
fleeting
elegance
with
her
the
change
was
instantaneous
at
first
i
hoped
that
the
taste
i
could
not
give
her
an
artistic
intelligence
and
love
of
the
beautiful
would
come
to
her
in
spite
of
herself
through
the
medium
of
this
wonderful
paris
with
its
unconscious
refining
influence
on
eyes
and
mind
but
what
can
be
done
with
a
woman
who
does
not
know
how
to
open
a
book
to
look
at
a
picture
who
is
always
bored
and
refuses
to
see
anything
i
soon
understood
that
i
must
resign
myself
to
have
by
my
side
nothing
but
a
housewife
active
and
economical
indeed
very
economical
according
to
proudhon
a
woman
nothing
more
i
could
have
shaped
my
course
accordingly
so
many
artists
are
in
the
same
plight
but
this
modest
rôle
was
not
enough
for
her
little
by
little
slyly
silently
she
managed
to
get
rid
of
all
my
friends
we
had
not
made
any
difference
in
our
talk
because
of
her
presence
we
talked
as
we
always
had
done
in
the
past
but
she
never
understood
the
irony
or
the
fantasy
of
our
artistic
exaggerations
of
our
wild
axioms
or
paradoxes
in
idea
is
travestied
only
to
figure
more
brilliantly
it
only
irritated
and
puzzled
her
seated
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
she
listened
and
said
nothing
planning
all
the
while
how
she
should
eliminate
one
by
one
those
who
so
much
shocked
her
notwithstanding
the
seeming
friendliness
of
the
welcome
there
could
already
be
felt
in
my
rooms
that
thin
current
of
cold
air
which
warns
that
the
door
is
open
and
that
it
is
time
to
leave
my
friends
once
gone
she
replaced
them
by
her
own
i
found
myself
surrounded
by
an
absurd
set
of
worthies
strangers
to
art
who
hated
poetry
and
scorned
it
because
it
made
no
money
on
purpose
the
names
of
fashionable
writers
who
manufacture
plays
and
novels
by
the
dozen
were
cited
before
me
with
the
remark
so
and
so
makes
a
great
deal
of
money
make
money
this
is
the
point
for
these
creatures
and
i
had
the
pain
of
seeing
my
wife
think
with
them
in
this
fatal
atmosphere
her
provincial
habits
her
mean
and
narrow
views
were
made
still
more
odious
by
an
incredible
stinginess
fifteen
thousand
francs
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
it
seemed
to
me
that
with
this
income
we
could
live
without
fear
of
the
morrow
not
at
all
she
was
always
grumbling
talking
of
economy
reform
good
investments
as
she
overpowered
me
with
these
dull
details
i
felt
all
desire
and
taste
for
work
ebb
away
from
me
sometimes
she
came
to
my
table
and
scornfully
turned
over
the
scattered
pages
only
that
she
would
say
counting
the
hours
lost
upon
the
insignificant
little
lines
ah
i
if
i
had
listened
to
her
my
glorious
title
of
poet
which
it
has
taken
me
so
many
years
to
win
would
be
now
dragged
through
the
black
mire
of
sensational
literature
and
when
i
think
that
to
this
selfsame
woman
i
had
at
first
opened
my
heart
confided
all
my
dreams
and
when
i
think
that
the
contempt
she
now
shows
me
because
i
do
not
make
money
dates
from
the
first
days
of
our
marriage
i
am
indeed
ashamed
both
of
myself
and
of
her
i
make
no
money
that
explains
everything
the
reproach
of
her
glance
her
admiration
for
fruitful
commonplaces
culminating
in
the
steps
she
took

lately
to
obtain
for
me

do
know
what

this

i
resisted
no
defence
remains
to
me
but
this
a
force
of
inertia
which
yields
to
no

no

that
you

grounds
to

your

for
a
judicial

let
us
not

that
the

law
is
a
very
downright
kind
of
thing
totally
devoid
of
delicate
feeling
for

it
recognizes
only
acts
serious
brutal

unfortunately
it

we

i
have
been
deeply
touched
while

the
account
of
the
first
year
of
your
married
life
so
very
painful
to
you
you
have
paid
dearly
for
the
glory
of
marrying
a
famous
artist
one
of
those
men
in
whom
fame
and
adulation
develop
monstrous
egotism
and
who
under
penalty
of
shattering
the
frail
and
timid
life
that
would
attach
itself
to
theirs
must
live
alone
ah
madame
since
the
commencement
of
my
career
how
many
wretched
wives
have
i
not
beheld
in
the
same
cruel
position
as
yourself
artists
who
live
only
by
and
for
the
public
carry
nothing
home
to
their
hearth
but
fatigue
from
glory
or
the
melancholy
of
their
disappointments
an
existence
without
compass
or
rudder
subversive
ideas
contrary
to
all
social
conventionality
contempt
of
family
life
and
its
happiness
cerebral
excitement
sought
for
in
the
abuse
of
tobacco
and
strong
drink
without
mentioning
anything
else
this
constitutes
the
terrible
artistic
element
from
which
your
dear
aunt
is
desirous
of
withdrawing
you
but
i
must
repeat
that
while
i
fully
comprehend
her
anxiety
nay
her
remorse
even
at
having
consented
to
such
a
marriage
i
can
not
see
that
matters
have
reached
a
point
calculated
to
warrant
your

i
have
however
set
down
the
outlines
of
a
judicial
memorandum
in
which
your
principal
grievances
are
grouped
and
skilfully
brought
into
prominence
here
are
the
principal
divisions
of
the

all
this
as
you
see
dear
madame
constitutes
a
somewhat
respectable
amount
of
evidence

is
not
however
sufficient

ah
if
we
had
only
an
assault
with
violence
a
tiny
little
assault

our

would
be
grand

now
that
you
have
put
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
between
your
husband
and
yourself
we
can
scarcely
hope
for
an
incident
of
this
kind
i
say
hope
because
in
the
present
state

a
brutal

a
separation
is
it
not
scandalous
unjust
barbarous
outrageous
to
think
that
in
order
to
regain
her
freedom
my
poor
darling
will
be
obliged
to
run
her
neck
into
the
halter
to
abandon
herself
to
all
the
fury
of
that
monster
to
excite
it
even
but
no
matter
our
mind
is
made
up
an
assault
with
personal
violence
is
necessary
well
we
will
have
it
no
later
than
nina
will
return
to
paris
how
will
she
be
received
what
will
take
place
there
i
can
not
think
of
it
without
a
shudder
at
this
idea
my
hand
trembles
my
eyes
become
dimmed
ah
monsieur

monsieur

unhappy

the
law
court
of

monsieur
henri

literary
man
in
be
calm
be
calm

calm
i
forbid
your
going
to
moulins
or
rushing
off
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive
it
is
more
judicious
and
safer
to
await
her
return
in
your
own
house
by
your
fireside
in
point
of
fact
what
has
taken
place
you
refused
to
receive
that
ridiculous
and
old
maid
your
wife
has
gone
to
join
her
you
should
have
expected
as
much
family
ties
are
very
strong
in
the
heart
of
such
an
extremely
youthful
bride
you
were
in
too
great
a
hurry
remember
that
this
aunt
brought
her
up
that
she
has
no
other
relations
in
the
world
she
has
her
husband
you
will
say
ah
my
dear
fellow
between
ourselves
we
may
admit
that
husbands
are
not
always
amiable
i
know
one
more
especially
who
in
spite
of
his
good
heart
is
so
nervous
so
violent
i
am
well
aware
that
hard
work
and
artistic
preoccupations
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
it
be
that
as
it
may
the
bird
has
been
scared
and
has
flown
back
to
its
former
cage
do
be
alarmed
it
wo
stay
there
long
either
i
am
very
much
mistaken
or
the
parisian
of
yesterday
will
soon
weary
of
the
antiquated
surroundings
and
ere
long
regret
the
vivacities
of
her
poet
above
all
do
stir
your
old
friend
marestang
monsieur
marestang
attorney
in
at
the
same
moment
with
your
rational
and
friendly
letter
i
received
a
telegram
from
moulins
announcing
nina
return
ah
what
a
true
prophet
you
were
she
is
coming
back
this
evening
all
alone
just
as
she
left
me
without
the
slightest
advance
on
my
part
the
thing
now
will
be
to
arrange
so
easy
and
agreeable
a
life
for
her
that
she
shall
never
again
be
tempted
to
leave
me
i
have
laid
in
a
stock
of
tenderness
and
patience
during
her
week
absence
there
is
only
one
point
on
which
i
remain
inflexible
i
will
not
again
receive
that
horrible
that
blue
stocking
of
who
gave
me
her
niece
only
in
the
hopes
that
my
modest
fame
would
serve
to
heighten
hers
remember
my
dear
marestang
that
ever
since
my
marriage
this
wicked
little
old
woman
has
always
come
between
my
wife
and
me
pushing
her
hump
into
all
our
amusements
at
the
theatres
the
exhibitions
in
society
in
the
country
everywhere
in
fact
and
you
wonder
after
that
at
my
having
displayed
a
certain
haste
in
getting
rid
of
her
and
packing
her
off
to
her
good
town
of
moulins
indeed
my
dear
fellow
you
have
no
idea
of
all
the
harm
those
old
maids
suspicious
and
ignorant
of
life
are
capable
of
doing
in
a
young
household
this
one
had
stuffed
my
wife
pretty
little
head
full
of
false
old
fashioned
preposterous
ideas
trumpery
sentimentality
of
the
time
of
ipsiboé
or
young
florange
ah
if
my
lady
love
saw
me
for
her
i
was
a
poâte
the
poâte
one
sees
on
the
frontispieces
of
renduel
or
ladvocat
crowned
with
laurels
a
lyre
on
his
hips
and
his
short
cloak
blown
aside
by
a
parnassian
gust
of
wind
that
was
the
husband
she
had
promised
her
niece
and
you
may
fancy
how
terribly
my
poor
nina
must
have
been
disappointed
nevertheless
i
admit
that
i
was
very
bungling
with
the
dear
child
as
you
say
i
wanted
to
go
ahead
too
rapidly
i
frightened
her
it
was
my
part
gently
to
modify
all
that
the
rather
narrowing
and
false
education
of
the
convent
and
the
sentimental
dreams
of
the
aunt
had
effected
leaving
the
provincial
perfume
time
to
evaporate
however
all
this
can
be
repaired
since
she
is
returning
she
is
returning
my
dear
friend
this
evening
i
shall
go
and
meet
her
at
the
station
and
we
shall
walk
home
arm
in
arm
reconciled
and
happy
henri
de
b

to
her
aunt
in
he
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
station
and
greeted
me
with
a
smile
and
open
arms
as
though
i
were
returning
from
some
ordinary
journey
you
can
imagine
that
i
put
on
my
iciest
appearance
directly
i
reached
home
i
shut
myself
up
in
my
room
where
i
dined
alone
pleading
fatigue
after
which
i
locked
myself
in
he
came
to
bid
me
through
the
and
to
my
great
surprise
went
away
on
tiptoe
without
anger
or
importunity
this
morning
i
called
on
monsieur
petitbry
who
gave
me
detailed
instructions
as
to
the
way
i
was
to
act
the
hour
place
witnesses
ah
my
dear
aunt
if
you
knew
how
frightened
i
am
as
the
hour
draws
near
illustration
his
violence
is
so
dreadful
even
when
he
is
gentle
like
yesterday
his
eyes
have
flashes
of
lightning
however
i
will
try
and
be
courageous
in
thinking
of
you
my
darling
aunt
besides
as
monsieur
petitbry
said
to
me
it
is
only
a
short
painful
moment
to
get
over
and
then
we
will
both
resume
our
former
quiet
life
so
calm
and
happy
nina

illustration
illustration
the
same
to
the
dear
aunt
i
am
writing
to
you
from
my
bed
torn
by
the
emotions
of
that
terrible
scene
who
could
have
supposed
that
things
would
take
this
turn
nevertheless
i
had
taken
every
precaution
i
had
warned
marthe
and
her
sister
who
were
to
come
at
one
and
i
had
chosen
for
the
great
scene
the
moment
when
on
leaving
the
table
the
servants
are
clearing
away
in
the
next
to
the
study
from
early
morn
my
plans
were
laid
an
hour
of
scales
and
exercises
on
the
piano
the
du
the
de
all
the
pieces
he
hates
this
did
not
prevent
his
working
away
without
betraying
the
slightest
irritability
at
breakfast
the
same
patience
a
detestable
breakfast
scraps
and
the
sweet
dishes
he
loathes
and
if
you
had
seen
my
costume
a
dress
with
a
cape
some
five
years
out
of
date
a
little
black
silk
apron
and
uncurled
hair
in
vain
i
sought
for
some
signs
of
irritation
that
straight
line
that
monsieur
hollows
out
between
his
eyebrows
at
the
least
annoyance
well
no
nothing
really
i
might
have
thought
they
had
changed
my
husband
he
said
to
me
in
a
calm
and
rather
sad
tone
ah
you
have
done
your
hair
in
the
old
way
i
hardly
answered
not
wishing
to
hurry
on
matters
before
my
witnesses
had
arrived
and
then
strangely
enough
i
felt
somewhat
moved
and
upset
beforehand
by
the
scene
i
was
trying
to
get
up
at
last
after
a
few
still
shorter
replies
on
my
part
he
rose
from
the
table
and
went
into
his
own
room
i
followed
him
trembling
i
heard
my
friends
stationing
themselves
in
the
little
and
pierre
who
came
and
went
arranging
the
glasses
and
silver
the
decisive
moment
had
arrived
he
must
now
be
brought
to
the
needful
point
of
violence
and
it
seemed
to
me
this
would
be
easy
after
all
i
had
done
since
the
morning
to
irritate
him
when
i
entered
his
study
i
must
have
been
very
pale
i
felt
myself
in
the
lion
cage
the
thought
flashed
across
me
suppose
he
killed
me
he
did
not
present
a
very
terrible
appearance
however
leaning
back
on
his
divan
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
do
i
disturb
you
i
asked
in
my
most
ironical
voice
he
replied
gently
no
you
see
i
am
not
working
myself
viciously
ah
indeed
you
do
work
then
at
all
now
he
still
very
mild
you
are
mistaken
my
dear
on
the
contrary
i
work
a
great
deal
only
our
craft
is
one
in
which
a
great
deal
of
work
can
be
done
without
having
a
tool
in
hand
and
what
may
you
be
doing
at
this
moment
ah
yes
i
know
your
play
in
verse
always
the
same
thing
for
the
last
two
years
it
is
certainly
lucky
that
your
wife
had
a
fortune
that
allows
you
to
idle
at
your
ease
i
thought
he
would
have
sprung
upon
me
at
this
not
a
bit
of
it
he
came
up
to
me
and
took
hold
of
my
hands
gently
come
is
it
to
be
always
the
same
thing
are
we
to
begin
our
life
of
warfare
again
if
so
why
did
you
come
back
i
confess
i
felt
rather
moved
by
his
sad
and
affectionate
tone
but
i
thought
of
you
my
poor
aunt
of
your
exile
of
his
harsh
conduct
towards
us
and
that
gave
me
courage
i
said
to
him
the
bitterest
most
wounding
things
i
could
think
of
i
know
not
what
that
i
wished
to
heaven
i
had
never
married
an
artist
that
at
moulins
every
one
pitied
me
that
i
found
my
friends
married
to
magistrates
serious
influential
men
in
good
positions
while
he
if
even
he
made
money
but
no
monsieur
would
work
for
fame
only
and
what
fame
illustration
at
moulins
no
one
knew
him
at
paris
his
pieces
were
hissed
his
books
did
not
sell
and
so
on
and
so
on
my
brain
seemed
to
whirl
round
as
all
the
malicious
words
came
from
me
one
after
the
other
he
looked
at
me
without
replying
in
chilly
anger
of
course
this
coldness
exasperated
me
still
more
i
was
so
much
excited
that
i
no
longer
recognized
my
own
voice
raised
to
an
extraordinary
pitch
and
the
last
words
i
screamed
at
him
i
ca
remember
what
unjust
and
mad
remark
it
was
seemed
to
buzz
indistinctly
in
my
ears
for
a
moment
i
thought
monsieur
petitbry
assault
with
violence
was
an
accomplished
fact
pallid
with
set
teeth
henri
made
two
steps
towards
me
madame
then
suddenly
his
anger
fell
his
face
became
impassive
again
and
he
looked
at
me
with
so
scornful
insolent
and
calm
a
glance
that
my
patience
came
to
an
end
i
raised
my
hand
and
gave
him
the
best
box
on
the
ear
i
ever
gave
in
my
life
at
the
noise
the
door
opened
and
my
witnesses
appeared
solemn
and
indignant
monsieur
this
is
infamous
yes
is
it
said
the
poor
fellow
showing
his
red
cheek
you
can
imagine
my
confusion
happily
i
took
the
line
of
fainting
and
melting
into
torrents
of
tears
which
relieved
me
greatly
at
present
henri
is
in
my
room
he
watches
by
me
nurses
me
and
is
really
most
kind
what
can
i
do

a
checkmate
this
will
not
prove
very
satisfactory
to

i
hardly
fancy
it
would
be
possible
to
find
in
the
whole
of
paris
a
more
lively
and
peculiar
house
than
that
of
the
sculptor
simaise
life
there
is
one
continual
round
of
festivities
at
whatever
hour
you
drop
in
upon
them
a
sound
of
singing
and
laughter
or
the
jingle
of
a
piano
guitar
or
tamtam
greets
you
you
can
never
enter
the
studio
without
finding
a
waltz
going
on
or
a
set
of
quadrilles
or
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
or
else
it
is
cumbered
with
all
the
litter
and
preparations
for
a
ball
shreds
of
tulle
and
ribbons
lying
scattered
among
the
sculptor
chisels
artificial
flowers
hanging
over
the
busts

spangled

spreading
over
groups

the
fact
is
that
four
big
t
daughters
of
sixteen
to
years
of
age
all
very
pretty
indeed
take
up
a
great
deal
of
room
and
when
these
young
ladies
whirl
round
with
their
hair
streaming
down
their
backs
with
floating
ribbons
long
pins
and
showy
ornaments
it
really
seems
as
if
instead
of
four
there
were
eight
sixteen
misses
simaise
as
dashing
the
one
as
the
other
talking
and
laughing
loudly
with
the
hoydenish
manner
peculiar
to
artists
daughters
with
the
studio
jests
the
familiarity
of
students
and
knowing
also
better
than
anyone
how
to
dismiss
a
creditor
or
blow
up
a
tradesman
impertinent
enough
to
present
his
bill
at
an
inopportune
moment
illustration
these
young
damsels
are
the
real
mistresses
of
the
house
from
early
dawn
the
father
works
chisels
models
unceasingly
for
he
has
no
settled
income
at
first
he
was
ambitious
and
strove
to
do
good
work
some
early
successful
exhibitions
promised
him
future
fame
but
the
necessity
of
providing
for
the
support
of
his
family
the
clothing
feeding
and
future
establishment
of
his
children
threw
him
back
into
the
ordinary
work
of
the
trade
as
for
madame
simaise
she
never
attended
to
anything
very
handsome
when
she
married
very
much
admired
in
the
artistic
world
into
which
her
husband
introduced
her
at
first
satisfied
with
being
only
a
pretty
woman
later
on
she
resigned
herself
to
the
part
of
a
woman
who
had
been
pretty
a
créole
by
birth
at
least
such
was
her
pretension
although
it
was
asserted
that
her
parents
had
never
left
courbevoie
she
spent
the
days
from
morning
to
night
in
a
hammock
swung
up
in
turn
in
all
the
different
rooms
of
the
house
fanning
herself
and
taking
siestas
full
of
contempt
for
the
material
details
of
everyday
life
she
had
so
often
sat
to
her
husband
as
model
for
hebes
and
dianas
that
she
fancied
her
only
duty
was
to
pass
through
life
carrying
some
emblem
of
a
goddess
such
as
a
crescent
on
her
head
or
a
goblet
in
her
hand
indeed
the
disorder
of
the
establishment
was
a
sight
in
itself
the
least
thing
necessitated
a
full
hour
search
have
you
seen
my
thimble
marthe
eva
geneviève
madeleine
who
has
seen
my
thimble
the
drawers
in
which
books
powder
rouge
spangles
spoons
and
fans
are
tossed
at
haphazard
though
crammed
full
contain
absolutely
nothing
useful
moreover
they
belong
to
strange
pieces
of
furniture
curious
battered
and
incomplete
and
how
peculiar
is
the
house
itself
as
they
are
constantly
changing
their
residence
they
never
have
time
to
settle
anywhere
and
this
merry
household
seems
to
be
perpetually
awaiting
the
setting
to
rights
indispensable
after
a
ball
only
so
many
things
are
lacking
that
it
is
not
worth
while
settling
and
as
long
as
they
can
put
on
a
bit
of
finery
display
themselves
out
of
doors
with
something
of
a
meteor
flash
a
semblance
of
style
and
appearance
of
luxury
honour
is
saved
encampment
does
not
in
any
way
distress
this
migratory
tribe
through
the
doors
their
poverty
is
betrayed
by
the
four
bare
walls
of
an
unfurnished
chamber
or
the
litter
of
an
overcrowded
room
it
is
bohemianism
in
the
domestic
circle
a
life
full
of
improvidence
and
surprises
at
the
very
moment
when
they
sit
down
to
table
they
suddenly
perceive
that
everything
is
wanting
and
that
the
breakfast
must
be
sent
out
for
at
once
in
this
manner
hours
are
spent
rapidly
bustling
and
idling
and
herein
lies
a
certain
advantage
after
a
late
breakfast
one
does
not
need
to
dine
but
can
sup
at
the
ball
which
fills
up
nearly
every
evening
these
ladies
also
give
evening
parties
tea
is
drunk
out
of
all
kinds
of
queer
receptacles
goblets
old
tankards
ancient
glasses
japanese
shells
the
whole
chipped
and
cracked
by
the
constant
moves
illustration
the
serene
calm
of
both
mother
and
daughters
in
the
midst
of
this
poverty
is
truly
admirable
they
have
indeed
other
ideas
running
through
the
brain
than
mere
housekeeping
details

plaited
her
hair

in
the
beatitude
of
her
former
beauty
as
for
father
simaise
he
is
always
delighted
as
long
as
he
hears
the
merry
laugh
of
his
daughters
around
him
he
is
ready
cheerfully
to
assume
all
the
weight
of
this
disorderly
existence
to
him
are
addressed
in
a
coaxing
manner
such
requests
as
papa

want
a
bonnet
papa
i
must
have
a
dress
sometimes
the
winter
is
severe
they
are
in
such
request
receive
so
many
invitations
pooh
the
father
has
but
to
get
up
a
couple
of
hours
earlier
they
will
have
a
fire
only
in
the
studio
where
all
the
family
will
gather
the
girls
will
cut
out
and
make
their
own
dresses

illustration
have
you
ever
met
these
ladies
in
society
the
moment
they
appear
there
is
a
commotion
it
is
long
since
the
first
two
came
out
but
they
are
always
so
well
adorned
and
so
smart
that
they
are
in
great
request
as
partners
they
have
as
much
success
as
the
younger
sisters
almost
as
much
as
the
mother
in
former
days
moreover
they
carry
off
their
tawdry
jewelry
and
finery
so
well
and
have
such
charming
easy
manners
with
the
giddy
laugh
of
spoilt
children
and
such
a
spanish
way
of
flirting
with
a
fan
nevertheless
they
do
not
get
married
no
admirer
has
ever
been
able
to
get
over
the
sight
of
that
singular
home
the
wasteful
and
useless
extravagance
the
want
of
plates
the
profusion
of
old
tapestry
in
holes
of
antique
and
ungilt
lustres
the
draughty
doors
the
constant
visits
of
creditors
the
slatternly
appearance
of
the
young
ladies
in
slipshod
slippers
and
dressing
gowns
put
to
flight
the
best
intentioned
in
truth
it
is
not
everyone
who
could
resign
himself
to
hang
up
the
hammock
of
an
idle
woman
in
his
home
for
the
rest
of
his
life
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
the
misses
simaise
will
never
marry
they
had
however
a
golden
and
unique
opportunity
during
the
commune
the
family
had
taken
refuge
in
normandy
in
a
small
and
very
litigious
town
full
of
lawyers
attorneys
and
business
men
no
sooner
had
the
father
arrived
than
he
looked
out
for
orders
his
fame
as
a
sculptor
was
of
service
to
him
and
as
in
the
public
square
of
the
town
there
happened
to
be
a
statue
of
cujas
done
by
him
all
the
notabilities

to
have
their

up

they
at
once
met
with
great
success

at

poverty
seemed
but
an
accident
due
to
exile
the

their
destitution

had
started
off
without
anything

nothing

paris
was
closed
it

them

extra
charm
it
called
to
mind
travelling
gipsies
combing
their
beautiful
hair
in
barns
and
quenching
their
thirst
in
streams
the
least
poetical
compared
them

the
fact
is
if
one
had
gone
off
all
the
others
would
have
followed
suit
unluckily
the
first
never
went
off
but
it
was
a
near
touch
amongst
the
numerous
partners
of
these
young
ladies
in
that
corps
de
ballet
of
lawyers
attorneys
and

the
most
rabid

was
a

was
extremely
attentive
to
the
eldest
daughter

was
called
by
them
the
first
dancing
attorney
in
memory
of
moliere
ballets

certainly
considering
the
rate
at
which
the
fellow
whirled
round
papa
simaise
might
well
build
the
greatest
hopes
on
him
but
then
business
men
do
not

everybody

this
fellow
all
the

he
was
waltzing
reflected
silently
the

thought
the
first
dancing
attorney
and
in
fact
directly
the
blockade
of
paris
was
raised
he
got
his
information
about
the
family
and
the
marriage
did
not
come
off
since
then
the
poor
little
creatures
have
missed
many
other
chances

this
has
in
no

spoilt

to
marry
an

oh
my
dear
if
i
had
known
but
young
girls
have
singular
ideas
about
so
many
things
just
imagine
that
at
the
exhibition
when
i
read
in
the
catalogue
the
addresses
of
quiet
streets
at
the
further
end
of
paris
i
pictured
to
myself
peaceable
lives
devoted
to
work
and
the
family
circle
and
i
said
to
myself
feeling
beforehand
a
certainty
that
i
should
be
dreadfully
jealous
that
is
the
sort
of
husband
to
suit
me
he
will
always
be
with
me
we
shall
spend
our
days
together

at
his
picture
or
sculpture
while
i
read
or
sew
beside
him
in
the
concentrated
light
of
the
studio
poor
dear
innocent
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
then
what
a
studio
really
was
nor
of
the
singular
creatures
one
meets
there
never
in
gazing
at
those
statues
of
bold
undressed
goddesses
had
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
there
were
women
daring
enough
to
and
that
even
i
myself
otherwise
i
can
assure
you
i
should
never
have
married
a
sculptor
no
indeed
most
decidedly
not
i
must
own
they
were
all
against
this
marriage
at
home
notwithstanding
my
fortune
his
already
famous
name
and
the
fine
house
he
was
having
built
for
us
two
it
was
i
alone
who
would
have
it
so
he
was
so
elegant
so
charming
so
eager
i
thought
however
he
meddled
a
little
too
much
about
my
dress
and
the
arrangement
of
my
hair
do
your
hair
like
this
so
and
he
would
amuse
himself
by
placing
a
flower
in
the
midst
of
my
curls
with
far
greater
skill
than
any
one
of
our
milliners
so
much
experience
in
a
man
was
alarming
was
it
i
ought
to
have
distrusted
him
well

will
see
listen
illustration
we
returned
from
our
honeymoon
while
i
was
busy
settling
myself
in
my
pretty
and
charmingly
furnished
rooms
that
paradise
you
know
so
well
my
husband
from
the
moment
of
his
arrival
had
set
to
work
and
spent
the
days
at
his
studio
which
was
away
from
the
house
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
he
would
talk
to
me
with
feverish
eagerness
of
his
next
subject
for
exhibition
illustration
the
subject
was
a
roman
lady
leaving
the
bath
he
wanted
the
marble
to
reproduce
that
faint
shiver
of
the
skin
at
the
contact
of
air
the
moisture
of
the
delicate
textures
clinging
to
the
shoulders
and
all
sorts
of
other
fine
things
which
i
no
longer
remember
between
you
and
me
when
he
speaks
to
me
of
his
sculpture
i
always
understand
him
very
well
however
i
used
to
say
confidently
it
will
be
very
pretty
and
already
i
saw
myself
treading
the
finely
sanded
walks
admiring
my
husband
work
a
beautiful
marble
sculpture
gleaming
white
against
the
green
hangings
while
behind
me
i
heard
whispered
the
wife
of
the
sculptor
illustration
at
last
one
day
curious
to
see
how
our
roman
lady
was
getting
on
the
idea
occurred
to
me
to
go
and
take
him
by
surprise
in
his
studio
which
i
had
not
yet
visited
it
was
one
of
the
first
times
i
had
gone
out
alone
and
i
had
made
myself
very
smart
i
can
tell
you
when
i
arrived
i
found
the
door
of
the
little
garden
leading
to
the
ground
floor
wide
open
so
i
walked
straight
in
and
conceive
my
indignation
when
i
beheld
my
husband
in
a
white
smock
like
a
stone
mason
with
ruffled
hair
hands
grimed
with
clay
and
in
front
of
him
upright
on
a
platform
a
woman
my
dear
a
great
creature
almost
undressed
and
looking
just
as
composed
in
this
airy
costume
as
though
it
were
perfectly
natural
illustration
her
wretched
clothes
covered
with
mud
thick
walking
boots
and
a
round
hat
trimmed
with
a
feather
out
of
curl
were
thrown
beside
her
on
a
chair
all
this
i
saw
in
an
instant
for
you
may
imagine
how
i
fled
etienne
would
have
spoken
to
me
detained
me
but
with
a
gesture
of
horror
at
the
hands
i
rushed
off
to
mama
and
reached
her
barely
alive
you
can
imagine
my
appearance
illustration
good
heavens
dear
child
what
is
the
matter
i
related
to
mama
what
i
had
seen
where
this
dreadful
woman
was
and
in
what
costume
and
i
cried
and
cried
my
mother
much
moved
tried
to
console
me
explained
to
me
that
it
must
have
been
a
model
what
but
it
is
abominable
no
one
ever
told
me
about
that
before
i
was
married
hereupon
etienne
arrived
greatly
distressed
and
tried
in
his
turn
to
make
me
understand
that
a
model
is
not
a
woman
like
other
women
and
that
besides
sculptors
can
not
get
on
without
them
but
these
reasons
had
no
effect
upon
me
and
i
stoutly
declared
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
husband
who
spent
his
days
with
young
ladies
in
such
a
costume
come
my
dear
etienne
said
poor
mama
trying
hard
to
arrange
everything
peaceably
could
you
not
out
of
respect
for
your
feelings
replace
this
creature
by
a
dummy
a
lay
figure
my
husband
bit
his
moustaches
furiously
quite
impossible
dear
mother
still
my
dear
it
seems
to
me
a
bright
idea
milliners
have
pasteboard
heads
on
which
they
trim
bonnets
well
what
can
be
done
for
a
head
could
it
not
be
done
for
it
seems
this
is
not
possible
at
least
this
was
what
etienne
tried
to
demonstrate
at
great
length
with
all
sorts
of
details
and
technical
words
he
really
looked
very
unhappy
i
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
while
i
dried
my
tears
and
i
saw
that
my
grief
affected
him
deeply
at
last
after
an
endless
discussion
it
was
agreed
that
since
the
model
was
indispensable
i
should
be
there
whenever
she
came
there
chanced
to
be
on
one
side
of
the
studio
a
very
convenient
little
from
which
i
could
see
without
being
seen
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
you
will
say
of
being
jealous
of
such
kind
of
creatures
and
of
showing
my
jealousy
but
my
pet
you
must
have
gone
through
these
emotions
before
you
can
offer
an
opinion
about
them
next
day
the
model
was
to
be
there
i
therefore
summoned
up
my
courage
and
installed
myself
in
my
with
the
express
condition
that
at
the
least
tap
at
the
partition
my
husband
should
come
to
me
at
once
scarcely
had
i
shut
myself
in
when
the
dreadful
model
i
had
seen
the
other
day
arrived
dressed
heaven
knows
how
and
so
wretched
in
appearance
that
i
asked
myself
how
i
could
have
been
jealous
of
a
woman
who
could
walk
abroad
without
a
scrap
of
white
cuff
at
her
wrists
and
in
an
old
shawl
with
green
fringe
well
my
dear
when
i
saw
this
creature
throw
off
shawl
and
dress
in
the
middle
of
the
studio
and
begin
to
undress
in
the
coolest
and
boldest
manner
it
had
an
effect
upon
me
i
can
not
describe
i
choked
with
rage
i
thumped
at
the
partition
etienne
came
to
me
i
trembled
i
was
pale
he
laughed
at
me
gently
me
and
returned
to
his
work
by
this
time
the
woman
was
standing
up
her
thick
hair
loosened
and
hanging
down
her
back
in
glossy
heaviness
it
was
no
longer
the
poor
wretch
of
a
moment
ago
but
already
almost
a
statue
notwithstanding
her
common
and
listless
air
my
heart
died
within
me
however
i
said
nothing
all
at
once
i
heard
my
husband
cry
the
left
leg
the
left
leg
forward
and
as
the
model
did
not
understand
him
at
once
he
went
to
her
and
oh
i
could
contain
myself
no
longer
i
knocked
he
did
not
hear
me
i
knocked
again
furiously
this
time
he
ran
to
me
frowning
a
little
at
being
disturbed
in
the
heat
of
work
come
armande
do
be
reasonable
bathed
in
tears
i
leant
my
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
sobbed
out
i
ca
bear
it
my
dear
i
ca
indeed
i
ca
illustration
at
this
without
answering
me
he
went
sharply
into
the
studio
and
made
a
sign
to
that
horror
of
a
woman
who
dressed
herself
and
departed
for
several
days
etienne
did
not
return
to
the
studio
he
remained
at
home
with
me
would
not
go
out
refused
even
to
see
his
friends
otherwise
he
was
quite
kind
and
gentle
but
he
had
such
a
melancholy
air
once
i
asked
him
timidly
you
are
not
working
any
more
which
earned
me
this
reply
one
ca
work
without
a
model
i
had
not
the
courage
to
pursue
the
subject
for
i
felt
how
much
i
was
to
blame
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
vexed
with
me
nevertheless
by
dint
of
caresses
and
endearments
i
cajoled
him
into
returning
to
his
studio
and
trying
to
finish
the
statue
how
do
they
say
it
out
of
his
head
from
imagination
in
short
by
mama
process
to
me
this
seemed
quite
feasible
but
it
gave
the
poor
fellow
endless
trouble
every
evening
he
came
in
with
irritated
nerves
and
more
and
more
discouraged
almost
ill
indeed
to
cheer
him
up
i
used
often
to
go
and
see
him
i
always
said
it
is
charming
but
as
a
fact
the
statue
made
no
progress
whatever
i
do
even
know
if
he
worked
at
it
when
i
arrived
i
would
find
him
always
smoking
on
his
divan
or
perhaps
rolling
up
pellets
of
clay
which
he
angrily
threw
against
the
opposite
wall
one
afternoon
when
i
was
gazing
at
the
unfortunate
roman
lady
who
half
modelled
had
been
so
long
in
stepping
out
of
her
bath
an
idea
occurred
to
me
the
roman
lady
was
about
the
same
figure
as
myself
perhaps
at
a
pinch
i
might
what
do
you
mean
by
a
leg
i
asked
my
husband
suddenly
he
explained
it
to
me
at
great
length
showing
me
all
that
was
still
lacking
to
his
statue
and
which
he
could
by
no
means
give
it
without
a
model
poor
fellow
he
had
such
a
air
as
he
said
this
do
you
know
what
i
did
well
i
bravely
picked
up
the
drapery
which
was
lying
in
a
corner
i
went
into
my
then
very
softly
without
saying
a
word
while
he
was
still
looking
at
his
statue
i
placed
myself
on
the
platform
in
front
of
him
in
the
costume
and
attitude
in
which
i
had
seen
that
abominable
model
ah
my
dear
i
what
emotion
i
felt
when
he
raised
his
eyes
i
could
have
laughed
and
cried
i
was
blushing
all
over
and
that
tiresome
muslin
took
so
much
arranging
never
mind
etienne
was
so
delighted
that
i
was
soon
indeed
to
hear
him
my
dear
you
might

a
great
man
widow
no
one
was
astonished
at
hearing
she
was
going
to
marry
again
notwithstanding
all
his
genius
perhaps
even
on
account
of
his
genius
the
great
man
had
for
fifteen
years
led
her
a
hard
life
full
of
caprices
and
mad
freaks
that
had
attracted
the
attention
of
all
paris
on
the
high
road
to
fame
over
which
he
had
so
triumphantly
and
hurriedly
travelled
like
those
who
are
to
die
young
she
had
sat
behind
him
humbly
and
timidly
in
a
corner
of
the
chariot
ever
fearful
of
collisions
whenever
she
complained
relatives
friends
every
one
was
against
her
respect
his
weaknesses
they
would
say
to
her
they
are
the
weaknesses
of
a
god
do
not
disturb
him
do
not
worry
him
remember
that
your
husband
does
not
belong
exclusively
to
you
he
belongs
much
more
to
art
to
his
country
than
to
his
family
and
who
knows
if
each
of
the
faults
you
reproach
him
with
has
not
given
us
some
sublime
creation
at
last
however
her
patience
was
worn
out
she
rebelled
became
indignant
and
even
unjust
so
much
indeed
that
at
the
moment
of
the
great
man
death
they
were
on
the
point
of
demanding
a
judicial
separation
and
ready
to
see
their
great
and
celebrated
name
dragged
into
the
columns
of
a
society
paper
after
the
agitation
of
this
unhappy
match
the
anxieties
of
the
last
illness
and
the
sudden
death
which
for
a
moment
revived
her
former
affection
the
first
months
of
her
widowhood
acted
on
the
young
woman
like
a
healthy
calming
the
enforced
retirement
the
quiet
charm
of
mitigated
sorrow
lent
to
her
years
a
second
youth
almost
as
attractive
as
the
first
illustration
moreover
black
suited
her
and
then
she
had
the
responsible
and
rather
proud
look
of
a
woman
left
alone
in
life
with
all
the
weight
of
a
great
name
to
carry
honourably
mindful
of
the
fame
of
the
departed
one
that
wretched
fame
that
had
cost
her
so
many
tears
and
now
grew
day
by
day
like
a
magnificent
flower
nourished
by
the
black
earth
of
the
tomb
she
was
to
be
seen
draped
in
her
long
sombre
veils
holding
interviews
with
theatrical
managers
and
publishers
busying
herself
in
getting
her
husband
operas
put
again
on
the
stage
superintending
the
printing
of
his
posthumous
works
and
unfinished
manuscripts
bestowing
on
all
these
details
a
kind
of
solemn
care
and
as
it
were
the
respect
for
a
shrine
it
was
at
this
moment
that
her
second
husband
met
her
he
too
was
a
musician
almost
unknown
it
is
true
the
author
of
a
few
waltzes
and
songs
and
of
two
little
operas
of
which
the
scores
charmingly
printed
were
scarcely
more
played
than
sold
with
a
pleasant
countenance
a
handsome
fortune
that
he
owed
to
his
exceedingly
family
he
had
above
all
an
infinite
respect
for
genius
a
curiosity
about
famous
men
and
the
ingenuous
enthusiasm
of
a
still
youthful
artist
thus
when
he
met
the
wife
of
the
great
man
he
was
dazzled
and
bewildered
it
was
as
though
the
image
of
the
glorious
muse
herself
had
appeared
to
him
he
at
once
fell
in
love
and
as
the
widow
was
beginning
to
receive
a
few
friends
he
had
himself
presented
to
her
there
his
passion
grew
in
the
atmosphere
of
genius
that
still
lingered
in
all
the
corners
of
the
there
was
the
bust
of
the
master
the
piano
he
composed
on
his
scores
spread
over
all
the
furniture
melodious
even
to
look
at
as
though
from
between
their
pages
the
written
phrases
musically
the
actual
and
very
real
charm
of
the
widow
surrounded
by
those
austere
memories
as
by
a
frame
that
became
her
brought
his
love
to
a
climax
illustration
after
hesitating
a
long
time
the
poor
fellow
at
last
proposed
but
in
such
humble
and
timid
terms
he
knew
how
unworthy
he
was
of
her
he
understood
all
the
regret
she
would
feel
in
exchanging
her
illustrious
name
for
his
so
unknown
and
insignificant
and
a
thousand
other
artless
phrases
in
the
same
style
in
reality
the
lady
was
indeed
very
much
flattered
by
her
conquest
however
she
played
the
comedy
of
a
broken
heart
and
assumed
the
disdainful
wearied
airs
of
a
woman
whose
life
is
ended
without
hopes
of
renewal
she
who
had
never
in
her
life
been
so
quiet
and
comfortable
as
since
the
death
of
her
great
man
she
actually
found
tears
with
which
to
mourn
for
him
and
an
enthusiastic
ardour
in
speaking
of
him
this
of
course
only
inflamed
her
youthful
adorer
the
more
and
made
him
more
eloquent
and
persuasive
in
short
this
severe
widowhood
ended
in
a
marriage
but
the
widow
did
not
abdicate
and
remained
although
married
more
than
ever
the
widow
of
a
great
man
well
knowing
that
herein
lay
in
the
eyes
of
her
second
husband
her
real
prestige
as
she
felt
herself
much
older
than
he
to
prevent
his
perceiving
it
she
overwhelmed
him
with
her
disdain
with
a
kind
of
vague
pity
and
unexpressed
and
offensive
regret
at
her
condescending
marriage
however
he
was
not
wounded
by
it
quite
the
contrary
he
was
so
convinced
of
his
inferiority
and
thought
it
so
natural
that
the
memory
of
such
a
man
should
reign
despotically
in
her
heart
in
order
the
better
to
maintain
in
him
this
humble
attitude
she
would
at
times
read
over
with
him
the
letters
the
great
man
had
written
to
her
when
he
was
courting
her
this
return
towards
the
past
rejuvenated
her
some
fifteen
years
lent
her
the
assurance
of
a
handsome
and
beloved
woman
seen
through
all
the
wild
love
and
delightful
exaggeration
of
written
passion
that
she
had
since
then
changed
her
young
husband
cared
little
loving
her
on
the
faith
of
another
and
drawing
therefrom
i
know
not
what
strange
kind
of
vanity
it
seemed
to
him
that
these
passionate
appeals
added
to
his
own
and
that
he
inherited
a
whole
past
of
love
a
strange
couple
indeed
it
was
in
society
however
that
they
presented
the
most
curious
spectacle
i
sometimes
caught
sight
of
them
at
the
theatre
no
one
would
have
recognized
the
timid
and
shy
young
woman
who
formerly
accompanied
the
lost
in
the
gigantic
shadow
he
cast
around
him
now
seated
upright
in
the
front
of
the
box
she
displayed
herself
attracting
all
eyes
by
the
pride
of
her
own
glance
it
might
be
said
that
her
head
was
surrounded
by
her
first
husband
halo
of
glory
his
name
around
her
like
a
homage
or
a
reproach
the
other
one
seated
a
little
behind
her
with
the
subservient
physiognomy
of
one
ready
for
every
abnegation
in
life
watched
each
of
her
movements
ready
to
attend
to
her
slightest
wish
at
home
the
peculiarity
of
their
attitude
was
still
more
noticeable
i
remember
a
certain
evening
party
they
gave
a
year
after
their
marriage
the
husband
moved
about
among
the
crowd
of
guests
proud
but
rather
embarrassed
at
gathering
together
so
many
in
his
own
house
the
wife
disdainful
melancholy
and
very
superior
was
on
that
evening
more
than
ever
the
widow
of
a
great
man
she
had
a
peculiar
way
of
glancing
at
her
husband
from
over
her
shoulder
of
calling
him
my
poor
dear
friend
of
casting
on
him
all
the
wearisome
drudgery
of
the
reception
with
an
air
of
saying
you
are
only
fit
for
that
around
her
gathered
a
circle
of
former
friends
those
who
had
been
spectators
of
the
brilliant
debuts
of
the
great
man
of
his
struggles
and
his
success
she
simpered
to
them
played
the
young
girl
they
had
known
her
so
young
nearly
all
of
them
called
her
by
her
christian
name
anaïs
they
formed
a
kind
of
conaculum
which
the
poor
husband
respectfully
approached
to
hear
his
predecessor
spoken
of
they
recalled
the
glorious
first
nights
those
evenings
on
which
nearly
every
battle
was
won
and
the
great
manias
his
way
of
working
how
in
order
to
summon
up
inspiration
he
insisted
on
his
wife
being
by
his
side
decked
out
in
full
ball
dress
do
you
remember
anaïs
and
anaïs
sighed
and
blushed
it
was
at
that
time
that
he
had
written
his
most
tender
pieces
above
all
the
most
passionate
of
his
creations
with
a
grand
duet
interwoven
with
rays
of
moonshine
the
perfume
of
roses
and
the
warbling
of
nightingales
an
enthusiast
sat
down
and
played
it
on
the
piano
amid
a
silence
of
attentive
emotion
at
the
last
note
of
the
magnificent
piece
the
lady
burst
into
tears
i
can
not
help
it
she
said
i
have
never
been
able
to
hear
it
without
weeping
the
great
man
old
friends
surrounded
his
unhappy
widow
with
sympathetic
expressions
coming
up
to
her
one
by
one
like
at
a
funereal
ceremony
to
give
a
thrilling
clasp
to
her
hand
come
come
anaïs
be
courageous
and
the
drollest
thing
was
to
see
the
second
husband
standing
by
the
side
of
his
wife
deeply
touched
and
affected
shaking
hands
all
round
and
accepting
he
too
his
share
of
sympathy
what
genius
what
genius
he
repeated
as
he
mopped
his
eyes
it
was
at
the
same
time
ridiculous
and
affecting
illustration
illustration
the
deceiver
i
have
loved
but
one
woman
in
my
life
the
painter
d
said
one
day
to
us
i
spent
five
years
of
perfect
happiness
and
peaceful
and
fruitful
tranquillity
with
her
i
may
say
that
to
her
i
owe
my
present
celebrity
so
easy
was
work
and
so
spontaneous
was
inspiration
by
her
side
even
when
i
first
met
her
she
seemed
to
have
been
mine
from
time
immemorial
her
beauty
her
character
were
the
realization
of
all
my
dreams
that
woman
never
left
me
she
died
in
my
house
in
my
arms
loving
to
the
last
well
when
i
think
of
her
it
is
with
a
feeling
of
rage
if
i
strive
to
recall
her
the
same
as
i
ever
saw
her
during
those
five
years
in
all
the
radiance
of
love
with
her
lithe
yielding
figure
the
gilded
pallor
of
her
cheeks
her
oriental
jewish
features
regular
and
delicate
in
the
soft
roundness
of
her
face
her
slow
speech
as
velvety
as
her
glance
if
i
seek
to
embody
that
charming
vision
it
is
only
in
order
the
more
fiercely
to
cry
to
it
i
hate
you
her
name
was
clotilde
at
the
house
of
the
mutual
acquaintances
where
we
met
she
was
known
under
the
name
of
madame
deloche
and
was
said
to
be
the
widow
of
a
captain
in
the
merchant
service
indeed
she
appeared
to
have
travelled
a
great
deal
in
the
course
of
conversation
she
would
suddenly
say
when
i
was
at
tampico
or
else
once
in
the
harbour
at
valparaiso
but
apart
from
this
there
was
no
trace
in
her
manners
or
language
of
a
wandering
existence
nothing
betrayed
the
disorder
or
precipitation
of
sudden
departures
or
abrupt
returns
she
was
a
thorough
parisian
dressed
in
perfect
good
taste
without
any
of
those
or
eccentric
by
which
one
recognizes
the
wives
of
officers
and
sailors
who
are
always
arrayed
in
travelling
costume
illustration
when
i
found
that
i
loved
her
my
first
my
only
idea
was
to
ask
her
in
marriage
someone
spoke
on
my
behalf
she
simply
replied
that
she
would
never
marry
again
henceforth
i
avoided
meeting
her
and
as
my
thoughts
were
too
wholly
absorbed
and
occupied
by
her
to
allow
me
to
work
i
determined
to
travel
i
was
busily
engaged
in
preparations
for
my
departure
when
one
morning
in
my
own
apartment
in
the
midst
of
all
the
litter
of
opened
drawers
and
scattered
trunks
to
my
great
surprise
i
saw
madame
deloche
enter
why
are
you
leaving
she
said
softly
because
you
love
me
i
also
love
i
love
you
only
and
here
her
voice
shook
a
little
only
i
am
married
and
she
told
me
her
history
it
was
a
romance
of
love
and
desertion
her
husband
drank
struck
her
at
the
end
of
three
years
they
had
separated
her
family
of
whom
she
seemed
very
proud
held
a
high
position
in
paris
but
ever
since
her
marriage
had
refused
to
receive
her
she
was
the
niece
of
the
chief
rabbi
her
sister
the
widow
of
a
superior
officer
had
married
for
the
second
time
a
chief
ranger
of
the
woods
and
forests
of
as
for
her
ruined
by
her
husband
she
had
fortunately
had
a
very
thorough
education
and
possessed
some
accomplishments
by
which
she
was
able
to
augment
her
resources
she
gave
music
lessons
in
various
rich
houses
of
the
chaussée
and
faubourg
saint
honoré
and
gained
an
ample
livelihood
the
story
was
touching
although
somewhat
lengthy
full
of
the
pretty
repetitions
the
interminable
incidents
that
entangle
feminine
discourse
illustration
indeed
she
took
several
days
to
relate
it
i
had
hired
for
us
two
a
little
house
in
the
avenue
de
standing
between
the
silent
streets
and
peaceful
lawns
i
could
have
spent
a
year
listening
to
and
looking
at
her
without
a
thought
for
my
work
she
was
the
first
to
send
me
back
to
my
studio
and
i
could
not
prevent
her
from
again
taking
up
her
lessons
i
was
touched
by
her
concern
for
the
dignity
of
her
life
i
admired
the
proud
spirit
notwithstanding
that
i
could
not
help
being
rather
humiliated
at
her
expressed
determination
to
owe
nothing
save
to
her
own
exertions
we
were
therefore
separated
all
day
long
and
only
met
in
the
evening
in
our
little
house
with
what
joy
did
i
not
return
home
what
impatience
i
felt
when
she
was
late
and
how
happy
i
was
when
i
found
her
there
before
me
she
would
bring
me
back
bouquets
and
choice
flowers
from
her
journeys
to
paris
often
i
pressed
upon
her
some
present
but
she
laughingly
said
she
was
richer
than
i
and
in
truth
her
lessons
must
have
been
very
well
paid
for
she
always
dressed
in
an
expensively
elegant
manner
and
the
black
dresses
which
with
coquettish
care
for
her
complexion
and
style
of
beauty
she
preferred
had
the
dull
softness
of
velvet
the
brilliancy
of
satin
and
jet
a
confusion
of
silken
lace
which
revealed
to
the
astonished
eye
under
an
apparent
simplicity
a
world
of
feminine
elegance
in
the
thousand
shades
contained
in
a
single
colour
illustration
moreover
her
occupation
was
by
no
means
laborious
she
said
all
her
pupils
daughters
of
bankers
or
stock
brokers
loved
and
respected
her
and
many
a
time
she
would
show
me
a
bracelet
or
a
ring
that
had
been
presented
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
for
her
care
except
for
our
work
we
never
left
one
another
and
we
went
nowhere
only
on
sundays
she
went
off
to
to
see
her
sister
the
wife
of
the
chief
ranger
with
whom
she
was
now
reconciled
i
would
accompany
her
to
the
station
she
would
return
the
same
evening
and
often
in
the
long
summer
days
we
would
agree
to
meet
at
some
station
on
the
way
by
the
riverside
or
in
the
woods
she
would
tell
me
about
her
visit
the
children
good
looks
the
air
of
happiness
that
reigned
in
the
household
my
heart
bled
for
her
deprived
of
the
pleasures
of
family
life
as
she
was
doomed
to
be
and
my
tenderness
increased
tenfold
in
order
to
make
her
forget
the
falseness
of
her
position
so
painful
to
a
woman
of
her
character
what
a
happy
time
of
perfect
confidence
and
how
well
i
worked
i
suspected
nothing
all
she
said
seemed
so
true
so
natural
i
could
only
reproach
her
with
one
thing
when
talking
of
the
houses
she
frequented
and
the
different
families
of
her
pupils
she
would
indulge
in
a
superabundance
of
imaginary
details
and
fancied
intrigues
which
she
invented
without
any
illustration
calm
herself
she
was
ever
conjuring
up
romances
around
her
and
her
life
was
spent
in
composing
dramatic
situations
these
idle
fancies
disturbed
my
happiness
i
who
longed
to
leave
the
world
and
society
in
order
to
devote
myself
exclusively
to
her
found
her
too
much
taken
up
by
indifferent
subjects
however
i
could
easily
excuse
this
defect
in
a
young
and
unhappy
woman
whose
life
had
been
hitherto
a
sad
romance
the
issue
of
which
could
not
be
foreseen
once
only
did
a
suspicion
or
rather
a
presentiment
cross
my
mind
one
sunday
evening
she
failed
to
return
home
i
was
in
despair
what
could
i
do
go
to
i
might
compromise
her
nevertheless
after
a
dreadful
night
of
anguish
i
had
decided
on
starting
when
she
arrived
looking
pale
and
worried
her
sister
was
ill
she
had
been
obliged
to
stay
and
nurse
her
i
believed
all
she
told
me
not
distrusting
the
overflow
of
words
called
forth
by
the
slightest
question
which
swamped
the
principal
matter
in
a
deluge
of
idle
details
such
as
the
hour
of
arrival
the
rudeness
of
a
guard
the
lateness
of
the
train
twice
or
three
times
in
the
same
week
she
returned
to
and
slept
there
then
her
sister
illness
over
she
resumed
her
regular
and
peaceful
existence
illustration
unfortunately
shortly
after
this
she
in
her
turn
fell
she
came
back
one
day
from
her
lessons
shivering
wet
and
fevered
inflammation
of
the
lungs
set
in
from
the
first
her
case
was
serious
and
soon
the
doctor
told
me
hopeless
my
despair
was
maddening
then
i
thought
only
of
soothing
her
last
moments
the
family
she
loved
so
well
of
which
she
was
so
proud
i
would
bring
to
her
deathbed
without
letting
her
know
i
first
wrote
to
her
sister
at
and
i
went
off
at
once
myself
to
her
uncle
the
chief
rabbi
i
hardly
remember
at
what
unreasonable
hour
i
reached
his
house
great
catastrophes
throw
such
a
confusion
into
life
and
upset
every
detail
i
fancy
the
good
rabbi
was
dining
he
came
out
into
the
hall
wondering
and
amazed
to
speak
to
me
monsieur
i
said
to
him
there
are
moments
when
all
hatred
must
cease
he
turned
his
venerable
face
towards
me
with
a
bewildered
look
i
resumed
your
niece
is
dying
my
niece
but
i
have
no
niece
you
are
mistaken
oh
sir
i
implore
you
lay
aside
all
foolish
family
rancour
i
am
speaking
of
madame
deloche
the
wife
of
captain
i
do
not
know
madame
deloche
you
are
mistaken
my
son
i
assure
you
and
he
gently
pushed
me
toward
the
door
taking
me
for
a
hoaxer
or
a
madman
i
must
in
fact
have
appeared
very
odd
what
i
heard
was
so
unexpected
so
terrible
she
had
lied
to
me
then
wherefore
suddenly
an
idea
flashed
across
me
i
directed
the
cabman
to
drive
me
to
the
address
of
one
of
those
pupils
of
whom
she
had
so
often
spoken
to
me
the
daughter
of
a
banker
i
inquired
of
the
servant
madame
deloche
there
is
no
one
here
of
that
name
yes
i
know
that
it
is
a
lady
who
gives
music
lessons
to
your
young
ladies
we
have
no
young
ladies
here
not
even
a
piano
i
do
know
what
you
mean
and
he
angrily
shut
the
door
in
my
face
i
made
no
further
inquiries
i
felt
sure
of
meeting
with
the
same
answer
the
same
disappointment
on
my
return
to
our
little
house
they
gave
me
a
letter
with
the
postmark
of
i
opened
it
instinctively
guessing
the
contents
the
chief
ranger
also
had
no
knowledge
of
madame
deloche
moreover
he
had
neither
wife
nor
child
this
was
the
last
blow
thus
for
five
years
each
of
her
words
had
been
a
lie
a
thousand
jealous
thoughts
took
possession
of
me
and
madly
hardly
knowing
what
i
was
about
i
entered
the
room
in
which
she
was
dying
all
the
questions
that
were
torturing
me
burst
forth
over
that
bed
of
suffering
why
did
you
go
to
on
sundays
where
did
you
spend
your
days
where
did
you
spend
that
night
come
answer
me
and
i
bent
over
her
seeking
in
the
depths
of
her
still
proud
and
beautiful
eyes
answers
that
i
awaited
with
anguish
but
she
remained
mute
and
impassive
i
resumed
trembling
with
rage
you
never
gave
any
lessons
i
have
been
everywhere
nobody
knows
you
whence
came
that
money
those
laces
those
jewels
she
threw
me
a
glance
full
of
despairing
sadness
and
that
was
all
in
truth
i
ought
to
have
spared
her
and
allowed
her
to
die
in
peace
but
i
had
loved
her
too
well
my
jealousy
was
stronger
than
my
pity
i
continued
for
five
years
you
have
deceived
me
lying
to
me
every
day
every
hour
you
knew
my
whole
life
and
i
knew
nothing
of
yours
nothing
not
even
your
name
for
it

not
yours
is
it
the

you
bear
ah
liar

what
she
is
going
to
die

i
do
not

me

instead

answering
she
with
difficulty
turned
her
face
to
the
wall

though
she
feared
that
her
last
glance
might
betray
her
secret

the

died

this
little
note
on

glossiest

paper
embossed
with
the
arms
of
the

the

was
no

well
she
was

this
was
two
years
ago
the
supper
still
continued
but
whereas
irma
had
become
completely
a
part
of
the
poet
life
this
intimation
of
the
child
birth
curt
and
haughty
as
it
was
sufficiently
indicated
how
little
she
was
considered
by
him
and
in
truth
in
this
temporary
household
the
woman
was
scarcely
more
than
a
housekeeper
showing
in
the
management
of
the
house
the
hard
shrewdness
of
her
dual
nature
of
peasant
and
courtesan
and
endeavouring
at
no
matter
what
price
to
render
herself
indispensable
illustration
too
rustic
and
too
stupid
to
understand
anything
of
genius
of
those
fine
verses
fashionable
and
refined
which
made
of
him
a
sort
of
parisian
tennyson
she
nevertheless
understood
how
to
bend
to
all
his
whims
and
be
silent
under
his
contempt
as
if
in
the
depths
of
that
peasant
nature
lurked
something
of
the
boor
humble
admiration
for
his
lord
the
birth
of
the
child
only
served
to
accentuate
her
unimportance
in
the
house
when
the
dowager
comtesse
the
mother
of
the
poet
a
distinguished
and
very
great
lady
learned
that
a
grandson
was
born
to
her
a
sweet
little
vicomte
duly
recognized
and
authenticated
by
the
author
of
his
being
she
was
seized
with
a
wish
to
see
and
kiss
the
child
it
was
to
be
sure
a
rather
bitter
reflection
for
the
former
reader
to
queen
to
think
that
the
heir
of
such
a
great
name
should
have
such
a
mother
but
keeping
strictly
to
the
terms
of
the
de
faire
the
venerable
lady
could
forget
that
the
creature
existed
according
to
french
law
an
unmarried
man
recognizing
his
illegitimate
child
thereby
confers
on
him
all
the
rights
of
a
legitimate
one
including
both
title
and
fortune
when
she
went
to
see
the
child
out
at
nurse
she
chose
the
days
on
which
she
would
be
sure
not
to
meet
any
one
she
admired
him
spoilt
him
took
him
to
her
heart
worshipped
him
with
that
grandmotherly
adoration
which
is
the
last
love
of
a
woman
life
giving
her
an
excuse
for
living
a
few
years
longer
in
order
to
see
the
little
ones
springing
up
and
growing
around
her
then
when
the
baby
vicomte
was
a
little
bigger
and
returned
to
live
with
his
father
and
mother
a
treaty
was
made
for
the
comtesse

not
give
up
her
beloved
visits

the
sound
of
the
grandmother

humbly
and
silently
disappeared

else
the
child
was
taken
to
his
grandmother
house
and
thus
spoilt
by
his
two
mothers
he
loved
them
equally
somewhat
astonished
to
feel
in
the
warmth
of
their
caresses
a
kind
of
a
wish
to
monopolize
careless
of
everything
but
his
verses
absorbed
by
his
growing
fame
was
content
to
adore
his
little
robert
to
talk
of
him
to
everyone
and
to
imagine
that
the
child
belonged
to
him
and
him
only
this
illusion
did
not
last
i
should
like
to
see
you
married
his
mother
said
to
him
one
day
yes
but
how
about
the
child
do
worry
yourself
about
that
i
have
picked
out
for
you
a
young
girl
of
good
family
but
poor
who
adores
you
i
have
introduced
robert
to
her
and
they
are
already
great
friends
besides
the
first
year
i
will
keep
the
darling
with
me
afterwards
we
shall
see
illustration
and
the
mother
hesitated
the
poet
reddening
a
little
for
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
spoken
of
irma
to
his
mother
illustration
pooh
replied
the
old
dowager
laughing
we
will
settle
something
handsome
on
her
and
i
am
quite
sure
she
will
soon
be
married
also
the
of
paris
is
not
particular
that
very
evening
who
had
never
been
desperately
in
love
with
his
mistress
spoke
to
her
of
these
arrangements
and
found
her
as
usual
submissive
and
apparently
docile
to
his
will
but
the
next
day
when
he
returned
home
he
found
that
mother
and
child
had
flown
finally
they
were
discovered
in
a
wretched
hut
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
of
rambouillet
with
irma
father
and
when
the
poet
arrived
he
found
his
son
his
young
prince
in
his
velvet
and
lace
jumping
on
the
old
poacher
knee
playing
with
his
pipe
running
after
the
hens
delighted
to
shake
his
fair
curls
in
the
fresh
air
though
much
upset
by
emotion
pretended
to
laugh
the
affair
off

wished
at
once
to
take
his
fugitives
home
with
him
but
irma
did
not
see
the
matter
in
the
same
light
she
had
been
dismissed
she
took
her
child

her

more
natural

he
would

up

her
to

she
made
her
own

long
forgotten

she
was

disappear

hide
whenever
madame

no

for
her
the
child
was
growing
too
old
for
her
to
be
exposed
to
such
humiliations

him
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
as
madame
had
refused
to
be
brought
into
contact
with
her
son

she
should
no
longer
go
to
his
house

invisible

stitches

catch
back

folds

saddened

he
had
dressed
a
couple
of
hours
too
soon
and
the
beautiful
madame
guillardin
always
very
slow
over
her
dressing
had
positively
declared
that
on
this
day
she
would
only
be
ready
at
the
precise
moment
not
a
minute
earlier
do
you
hear
unfortunate
guillardin
what
could
he
do
to
kill
the
time
well
all
the
same
i
will
try
on
my
coat
he
said
and
gently
as
though
he
were
handling
tulle
and
lace
he
lifted
the
precious
frippery
and
having
donned
it
with
infinite
precaution
he
placed
himself
in
front
of
his
oh
what
a
charming
picture
the
mirror
disclosed
to
him
what
an
amiable
little
academician
freshly
hatched
happy
smiling
grizzled
and
protuberant
with
arms
too
short
in
proportion
to
his
figure
which
in
the
new
sleeves
acquired
a
stiff
and
automatic
dignity
illustration
thoroughly
satisfied
with
his
appearance
guillardin
marched
up
and
down
bowed
as
though
entering
the
academy
smiled
to
his
colleagues
of
the
fine
arts
and
assumed
academical
attitudes
nevertheless
whatever
pride
one
may
feel
at
one
personal
appearance
it
is
impossible
to
remain
two
hours
in
full
dress
before
a
at
last
our
academician
felt
somewhat
fatigued
and
fearful
lest
he
should
rumple
his
coat
made
up
his
mind
to
take
it
off
and
lay
it
back
very
carefully
on
the
then
seating
himself
opposite
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
with
his
legs
stretched
out
and
his
two
hands
crossed
over
his
dress
waistcoat
he
began
to
indulge
in
sweet
dreams
as
he
gazed
at
the
green
coat
like
the
traveller
who
arrived
at
the
end
of
his
journey
likes
to
remember
the
dangers
and
difficulties
that
have
beset
his
path
guillardin
retraced
his
life
year
by
year
from
the
day
when
he
began
to
learn
modelling
in
jouffroy
studio
ah
the
outset
is
hard
in
that
confounded
profession
he
remembered
the
fireless
winters
the
sleepless
nights
the
endless
walks
in
search
of
work
the
desperate
rage
experienced
at
feeling
so
small
so
lost
and
unknown
in
the
immense
crowd
that
pushes
hustles
upsets
and
crushes
and
yet
all
alone
without
patronage
or
money
he
had
managed
to
rise
by
sheer
talent
sir
and
his
head
thrown
back
and
eyes
the
worthy
man
kept
repeating
out
loud
to
himself
by
sheer
talent
nothing
but
talent
illustration
a
long
burst
of
laughter
dry
and
creaky
like
an
old
man
laugh
suddenly
interrupted
him
slightly
startled
guillardin
glanced
around
the
room
he
was
alone
quite
alone
with
his
green
coat
the
ghost
of
an
academician
solemnly
spread
out
opposite
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
still
the
insolent
laugh
rang
on
then
as
he
looked
at
it
more
intently
the
sculptor
almost
fancied
that
his
coat
was
no
longer
in
the
place
where
he
had
put
it
but
really
seated
in
the
with
tails
turned
up
and
sleeves
resting
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
the
fronts
puffed
out
with
an
appearance
of
life
incredible
as
it
may
seem
it
was
this
thing
that
was
laughing
yes
it
was
from
this
singular
green
coat
that
arose
the
uncontrollable
fits
of
laughter
by
which
it
was
agitated
shaken
and
convulsed
causing
it
to
jerk
its
tails
throw
itself
back
in
the
chair
and
at
moments
place
its
two
sleeves
against
its
sides
as
though
to
check
this
supernatural
and
inextinguishable
excess
of
mirth
at
the
same
time
a
feeble
voice
sly
and
mischievous
could
be
heard
saying
between
two
hiccups
oh
dear
oh
dear
how
it
hurts
one
to
laugh
like
this
how
it
hurts
one
to
laugh
like
this
who
the
devil
is
there
for
mercy
sake
asked
the
poor
academician
with
wide
staring
eyes
the
voice
continued
still
more
slyly
and
mischievously
but
it
i
monsieur
guillardin
i
your
coat
waiting
for
you
to
start
for
the
reception
i
must
crave
pardon
for
having
so
unseasonably
interrupted
your
musing
but
really
it
is
too
funny
to
hear
you
talk
of
your
talent
i
could
not
restrain
myself
come
you
ca
be
serious
can
you
conscientiously
believe
that
your
talent
has
sufficed
to
raise
you
so
rapidly
to
the
point
you
have
attained
in
life
that
it
has
given
you
all
you
possess
honours
position
fame
fortune
do
you
really
think
that
possible
guillardin
examine
yourself
my
dear
friend
before
answering
go
down
far
far
down
into
your
inmost
conscience
now
answer
me
do
you
see
you
dare
not
and
yet
stammered
guillardin
with
comical
hesitation
i
worked
a
great
deal
oh
yes
a
great
deal
you
have
fagged
tremendously
you
are
a
toiler
a
drudge
you
knock
off
a
great
deal
of
work
you
count
your
task
by
the
hour
like
a
cabdriver
but
the
spark
my
dear
boy
which
like
a
golden
bee
flits
through
the
brain
of
the
true
artist
and
emits
from
its
wings
both
light
and
music
when
has
it
ever
visited
you
not
once
and
you
are
well
aware
of
it
it
has
always
frightened
you
that
divine
little
bee
and
yet
it
is
this
only
that
gives
real
talent
ah
i
know
many
who
also
work
but
very
differently
from
you
with
all
the
anxiety
and
fever
of
sincere
research
and
yet
who
will
never
reach
the
point
you
have
attained
look
here
acknowledge
this
much
now
we
are
alone
your
one
talent
has
been
marrying
a
pretty
woman
monsieur
interrupted
guillardin
turning
purple
the
voice
proceeded
unchanged
ah
well
this
burst
of
indignation
is
a
good
sign
it
proves
to
me
what
all
the
world
knows
indeed
that
you
are
certainly
more
fool
than
knave
come
come
you
need
not
roll
such
furious
eyes
at
me
in
the
first
place
if
you
touch
me
if
you
make
the
least
crease
or
tear
in
me
it
will
be
impossible
to
go
to
the
reception
and
then
what
will
madame
guillardin
say
for
after
all
it
is
to
her
that
all
the
glory
of
this
great
day
is
due
illustration
it
is
she
whom
the
five
academies
are
about
to
receive
and
i
can
assure
you
that
if
i
appeared
at
the
on
her
pretty
person
still
so
elegant
and
slender
notwithstanding
her
age
i
should
cut
a
very
different
figure
than
with
you
confound
it
monsieur
guillardin
we
must
look
facts
in
the
face
you
owe
everything
to
that
woman
everything
your
house
your
forty
thousand
francs
sixteen
hundred
pounds
a
year
your
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
your
laurels
your
medals
and
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
the
green
coat
with
its
empty
embroidered
sleeve
pointed
out
to
the
unfortunate
sculptor
the
glorious
insignia
hung
up
on
the
walls
of
his
alcove
then
as
though
wishing
the
better
to
torment
his
victim
to
assume
every
aspect
and
every
attitude
the
cruel
coat
drew
nearer
the
fire
and
leaning
forward
on
his
with
a
little
and
confidential
air
he
spoke
familiarly
in
the
tone
of
a
intimacy
come
old
boy
what
i
said
seems
to
upset
you
yet
it
is
better
you
should
know
what
everybody
is
aware
of
and
who
could
tell
you
better
than
your
own
coat
let
us
reason
a
little
what
had
you
when
you
married
nothing
what
did
your
wife
bring
you
nothing
then
how
do
you
explain
your
present
fortune
you
are
going
to
repeat
again
that
you
have
worked
very
hard
but
my
poor
friend
working
day
and
night
with
all
the
patronage
and
the
orders
from
government
which
have
certainly
not
been
wanting
to
you
since
your
marriage
you
have
never
made
more
than
fifteen
thousand
francs
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
can
you
for
one
moment
suppose
that
was
sufficient
to
keep
up
an
establishment
like
yours
remember
that
the
beautiful
madame
guillardin
has
always
been
cited
as
a
model
of
elegance
frequenting
the
richest
society
of
course
i
am
well
aware
that
shut
up
as
you
were
from
morning
till
night
in
your
studio
you
never
gave
a
thought
to
all
this
you
were
satisfied
with
saying
to
your
friends
have
a
wife
who
is
a
surprisingly
skilful
manager
with
what
i
gain
she
not
only
pays
our
expenses
but
manages
also
to
put
by
money
it
was
you
who
were
surprising
poor
man
the
truth
was
that
you
had
married
one
of
those
pretty
little
unscrupulous
creatures
of
which
paris
is
full
an
ambitious
flirt
serious
in
what
concerned
your
interests
and
unprejudiced
in
regard
of
her
own
knowing
how
to
reconcile
your
affairs
and
her
pleasures
the
life
of
these
women
my
dear
fellow
resembles
a
dance
programme
in
which
sums
would
be
placed
side
by
side
with
the
dancers
names
yours
reasoned
in
the
following
manner
husband
has
no
talent
no
fortune
no
good
looks
either
but
he
is
an
excellent
man
credulous
as
little
in
the
way
as
possible
provided
he
leaves
me
free
to
amuse
myself
as
i
choose
i
can
undertake
to
give
him
all
he
lacks
and
from
that
day
forth
money
orders
decorations
from
all
countries
kept
pouring
in
upon
your
studio
with
their
pretty
metallic
sound
and
their
ribbons
look
at
the
row
on
my
lapel
then
one
fine
morning
madame
was
seized
with
the
fancy
a
fancy
of
beauty
on
the
wane
to
be
the
wife
of
an
academician
and
it
is
her
delicately
gloved
hand
that
has
opened
before
you
one
by
one
all
the
doors
of
the
sanctuary
ah
my
poor
old
fellow
your
colleagues
alone
can
tell
you
what
all
these
green
palms
have
cost
you
you
lie
you
lie
screamed
guillardin
half
choked
by
indignation
ah
no
my
old
friend
indeed
i
do
not
lie
you
need
only
to
look
around
you
presently
when
you
enter
the
reception
hall
you
will
see
a
malicious
gleam
in
every
eye
a
smile
at
the
corner
of
every
lip
while
they
will
whisper
as
you
pass
by
is
the
beautiful
madame
guillardin
husband
for
you
will
never
be
anything
else
in
life
my
dear
fellow
but
the
husband
of
a
pretty
woman
this
time
guillardin
could
bear
it
no
longer
pale
with
rage
he
bounded
forward
to
seize
and
dash
into
the
fire
after
first
tearing
from
it
the
pretty
green
palm
wreath
this
insolent
and
raving
coat
but
a
door
opens
and
a
voice
tinged
with
a
mixture
of
contempt
and
mild
condescension
opportunely
awakes
him
from
his
horrible
nightmare
oh
that
is
just
like
you
asleep
at
the
corner
of
the
fire
on
such
an
important
day
and
madame
guillardin
stands
before
him
tall
and
still
handsome
although
rather
too
imposing
with
her
almost
natural
pink
complexion
her
powdered
hair
and
the
exaggerated
brilliancy
of
her
painted
eyes
with
the
gesture
of
the
superior
woman
she
takes
up
the
coat
and
briskly
with
a
little
smile
helps
her
husband
to
don
it
while
he
poor
man
still
trembling
with
the
horrors
of
his
nightmare
draws
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
thinks
to
himself
thank
goodness
it
was
a
dream
