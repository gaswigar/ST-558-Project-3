preface
it
is
an
honourable
characteristic
of
the
spirit
of
this
age
that
projects
of
violence
and
warfare
are
regarded
among
civilized
states
with
gradually
increasing
aversion
the
universal
peace
society
certainly
does
not
and
probably
never
will
enrol
the
majority
of
statesmen
among
its
members
but
even
those
who
look
upon
the
appeal
of
battle
as
occasionally
unavoidable
in
international
controversies
concur
in
thinking
it
a
deplorable
necessity
only
to
be
resorted
to
when
all
peaceful
modes
of
arrangement
have
been
vainly
tried
and
when
the
law
of
justifies
a
state
like
an
individual
in
using
force
to
protect
itself
from
imminent
and
serious
injury
for
a
writer
therefore
of
the
present
day
to
choose
battles
for
his
favourite
topic
merely
because
they
were
battles
merely
because
so
many
myriads
of
troops
were
arrayed
in
them
and
so
many
hundreds
or
thousands
of
human
beings
stabbed
hewed
or
shot
each
other
to
death
during
them
would
argue
strange
weakness
or
depravity
of
mind
yet
it
can
not
be
denied
that
a
fearful
and
wonderful
interest
is
attached
to
these
scenes
of
carnage
there
is
undeniable
greatness
in
the
disciplined
courage
and
in
the
love
of
honour
which
make
the
combatants
confront
agony
and
destruction
and
the
powers
of
the
human
intellect
are
rarely
more
strongly
displayed
than
they
are
in
the
commander
who
regulates
arrays
and
wields
at
his
will
these
masses
of
armed
disputants
who
cool
yet
daring
in
the
midst
of
peril
reflects
on
all
and
provides
for
all
ever
ready
with
fresh
resources
and
designs
as
the
vicissitudes
of
the
storm
of
slaughter
require
but
these
qualities
however
high
they
may
appear
are
to
be
found
in
the
basest
as
well
as
in
the
noblest
of
mankind
catiline
was
as
brave
a
soldier
as
leonidas
and
a
much
better
officer
alva
surpassed
the
prince
of
orange
in
the
field
and
suwarrow
was
the
military
superior
of
kosciusko
to
adopt
the
emphatic
words
of
byron
is
the
cause
makes
all
degrades
or
hallows
courage
in
its
fall
there
are
some
battles
also
which
claim
our
attention
independently
of
the
moral
worth
of
the
combatants
on
account
of
their
enduring
importance
and
by
reason
of
the
practical
influence
on
our
own
social
and
political
condition
which
we
can
trace
up
to
the
results
of
those
engagements
they
have
for
us
an
abiding
and
actual
interest
both
while
we
investigate
the
chain
of
causes
and
effects
by
which
they
have
helped
to
make
us
what
we
are
and
also
while
we
speculate
on
what
we
probably
should
have
been
if
any
one
of
those
battles
had
come
to
a
different
termination
hallam
has
admirably
expressed
this
in
his
remarks
on
the
victory
gained
by
charles
martel
between
tours
and
poictiers
over
the
invading
saracens
he
says
of
it
that
it
may
justly
be
reckoned
among
those
few
battles
of
which
a
contrary
event
would
have
essentially
varied
the
drama
of
the
world
in
all
its
subsequent
scenes
with
marathon
arbela
the
metaurus
chalons
and
leipsic
it
was
the
perusal
of
this
note
of
hallam
that
first
led
me
to
the
consideration
of
my
present
subject
i
certainly
differ
from
that
great
historian
as
to
the
comparative
importance
of
some
of
the
battles
which
he
thus
enumerates
and
also
of
some
which
he
omits
it
is
probable
indeed
that
no
two
historical
inquirers
would
entirely
agree
in
their
lists
of
the
decisive
battles
of
the
world
different
minds
will
naturally
vary
in
the
impressions
which
particular
events
make
on
them
and
in
the
degree
of
interest
with
which
they
watch
the
career
and
reflect
on
the
importance
of
different
historical
personages
but
our
concurrence
in
our
catalogues
is
of
little
moment
provided
we
learn
to
look
on
these
great
historical
events
in
the
spirit
which
hallam
observations
indicate
those
remarks
should
teach
us
to
watch
how
the
interests
of
many
states
are
often
involved
in
the
collisions
between
a
few
and
how
the
effect
of
those
collisions
is
not
limited
to
a
single
age
but
may
give
an
impulse
which
will
sway
the
fortunes
of
successive
generations
of
mankind
most
valuable
also
is
the
mental
discipline
which
is
thus
acquired
and
by
which
we
are
trained
not
only
to
observe
what
has
been
and
what
is
but
also
to
ponder
on
what
might
have
been
see
bolingbroke
on
the
study
and
use
of
history
vol
ii
of
his
collected
works
we
thus
learn
not
to
judge
of
the
wisdom
of
measures
too
exclusively
by
the
results
we
learn
to
apply
the
juster
standard
of
seeing
what
the
circumstances
and
the
probabilities
were
that
surrounded
a
statesman
or
a
general
at
the
time
when
he
decided
on
his
plan
we
value
him
not
by
his
fortune
but
by
his
proairesiz
to
adopt
the
expressive
greek
word
for
which
our
language
gives
no
equivalent
the
reasons
why
each
of
the
following
fifteen
battles
has
been
selected
will
i
trust
appear
when
it
is
described
but
it
may
be
well
to
premise
a
few
remarks
on
the
negative
tests
which
have
led
me
to
reject
others
which
at
first
sight
may
appear
equal
in
magnitude
and
importance
to
the
chosen
fifteen
i
need
hardly
remark
that
it
is
not
the
number
of
killed
and
wounded
in
a
battle
that
determines
its
general
historical
importance
it
is
not
because
only
a
few
hundreds
fell
in
the
battle
by
which
joan
of
arc
captured
the
tourelles
and
raised
the
siege
of
orleans
that
the
effect
of
that
crisis
is
to
be
judged
nor
would
a
full
belief
in
the
largest
number
which
eastern
historians
state
to
have
been
slaughtered
in
any
of
the
numerous
conflicts
between
asiatic
rulers
make
me
regard
the
engagement
in
which
they
fell
as
one
of
paramount
importance
to
mankind
but
besides
battles
of
this
kind
there
are
many
of
great
consequence
and
attended
with
circumstances
which
powerfully
excite
our
feelings
and
rivet
our
attention
and
yet
which
appear
to
me
of
mere
secondary
rank
inasmuch
as
either
their
effects
were
limited
in
area
or
they
themselves
merely
confirmed
some
great
tendency
or
bias
which
an
earlier
battle
had
originated
for
example
the
encounters
between
the
greeks
and
persians
which
followed
marathon
seem
to
me
not
to
have
been
phenomena
of
primary
impulse
greek
superiority
had
been
already
asserted
asiatic
ambition
had
already
been
checked
before
salamis
and
platea
confirmed
the
superiority
of
european
free
states
over
oriental
despotism
so
which
finally
crushed
the
maritime
power
of
athens
seems
to
me
inferior
in
interest
to
the
defeat
before
syracuse
where
athens
received
her
first
fatal
check
and
after
which
she
only
struggled
to
retard
her
downfall
i
think
similarly
of
zama
with
respect
to
carthage
as
compared
with
the
metaurus
and
on
the
same
principle
the
subsequent
great
battles
of
the
revolutionary
war
appear
to
me
inferior
in
their
importance
to
valmy
which
first
determined
the
military
character
and
career
of
the
french
revolution
i
am
aware
that
a
little
activity
of
imagination
and
a
slight
exercise
of
metaphysical
ingenuity
may
amuse
us
by
showing
how
the
chain
of
circumstances
is
so
linked
together
that
the
smallest
skirmish
or
the
slightest
occurrence
of
any
kind
that
ever
occurred
may
be
said
to
have
been
essential
in
its
actual
termination
to
the
whole
order
of
subsequent
events
but
when
i
speak
of
causes
and
effects
i
speak
of
the
obvious
and
important
agency
of
one
fact
upon
another
and
not
of
remote
and
fancifully
infinitesimal
influences
i
am
aware
that
on
the
other
hand
the
reproach
of
fatalism
is
justly
incurred
by
those
who
like
the
writers
of
a
certain
school
in
a
neighbouring
country
recognise
in
history
nothing
more
than
a
series
of
necessary
phenomena
which
follow
inevitably
one
upon
the
other
but
when
in
this
work
i
speak
of
probabilities
i
speak
of
human
probabilities
only
when
i
speak
of
cause
and
effect
i
speak
of
those
general
laws
only
by
which
we
perceive
the
sequence
of
human
affairs
to
be
usually
regulated
and
in
which
we
recognise
emphatically
the
wisdom
and
power
of
the
supreme
lawgiver

two
thousand
three
hundred
and
forty
years
ago
a
council
of
athenian
officers
was
summoned
on
the
slope
of
one
of
the
mountains
that
look
over
the
plain
of
marathon
on
the
eastern
coast
of
attica
the
immediate
subject
of
their
meeting
was
to
consider
whether
they
should
give
battle
to
an
enemy
that
lay
encamped
on
the
shore
beneath
them
but
on
the
result
of
their
deliberations
depended
not
merely
the
fate
of
two
armies
but
the
whole
future
progress
of
human
civilization
there
were
eleven
members
of
that
council
of
war
ten
were
the
generals
who
were
then
annually
elected
at
athens
one
for
each
of
the
local
tribes
into
which
the
athenians
were
divided
each
general
led
the
men
of
his
own
tribe
and
each
was
invested
with
equal
military
authority
one
also
of
the
archons
was
associated
with
them
in
the
joint
command
of
the
collective
force
this
magistrate
was
termed
the
polemarch
or
he
had
the
privilege
of
leading
the
right
wing
of
the
army
in
battle
and
of
taking
part
in
all
councils
of
war
a
noble
athenian
named
callimachus
was
the
of
this
year
and
as
such
stood
listening
to
the
earnest
discussion
of
the
ten
generals
they
had
indeed
deep
matter
for
anxiety
though
little
aware
how
momentous
to
mankind
were
the
votes
they
were
about
to
give
or
how
the
generations
to
come
would
read
with
interest
that
record
of
their
debate
they
saw
before
them
the
invading
forces
of
a
mighty
empire
which
had
in
the
last
fifty
years
shattered
and
enslaved
nearly
all
the
kingdoms
and
principalities
of
the
then
known
world
they
knew
that
all
the
resources
of
their
own
country
were
comprised
in
the
little
army
entrusted
to
their
guidance
they
saw
before
them
a
chosen
host
of
the
great
king
sent
to
wreak
his
special
wrath
on
that
country
and
on
the
other
insolent
little
greek
community
which
had
dared
to
aid
his
rebels
and
burn
the
capital
of
one
of
his
provinces
that
victorious
host
had
already
fulfilled
half
its
mission
of
vengeance
eretria
the
confederate
of
athens
in
the
bold
march
against
sardis
nine
years
before
had
fallen
in
the
last
few
days
and
the
athenian
generals
could
discern
from
the
heights
the
island
of
aegilia
in
which
the
persians
had
deposited
their
eretrian
prisoners
whom
they
had
reserved
to
be
led
away
captives
into
upper
asia
there
to
hear
their
doom
from
the
lips
of
king
darius
himself
moreover
the
men
of
athens
knew
that
in
the
camp
before
them
was
their
own
banished
tyrant
hippias
who
was
seeking
to
be
reinstated
by
foreign
scimitars
in
despotic
sway
over
any
remnant
of
his
countrymen
that
might
survive
the
sack
of
their
town
and
might
be
left
behind
as
too
worthless
for
leading
away
into
median
bondage
the
numerical
disparity
between
the
force
which
the
athenian
commanders
had
under
them
and
that
which
they
were
called
on
to
encounter
was
fearfully
apparent
to
some
of
the
council
the
historians
who
wrote
nearest
to
the
time
of
the
battle
do
not
pretend
to
give
any
detailed
statements
of
the
numbers
engaged
but
there
are
sufficient
data
for
our
making
a
general
estimate
every
free
greek
was
trained
to
military
duty
and
from
the
incessant
border
wars
between
the
different
states
few
greeks
reached
the
age
of
manhood
without
having
seen
some
service
but
the
of
free
athenian
citizens
of
an
age
fit
for
military
duty
never
exceeded
thirty
thousand
and
at
this
epoch
probably
did
not
amount
to
of
that
number
moreover
the
poorer
portion
of
these
were
unprovided
with
the
equipments
and
untrained
to
the
operations
of
the
regular
infantry
some
detachments
of
the
best
armed
troops
would
be
required
to
garrison
the
city
itself
and
man
the
various
fortified
posts
in
the
territory
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
reckon
the
fully
equipped
force
that
marched
from
athens
to
marathon
when
the
news
of
the
persian
landing
arrived
at
higher
than
ten
thousand
men
the
historians
who
lived
long
after
the
time
of
the
battle
such
as
justin
plutarch
and
others
give
ten
thousand
as
the
number
of
the
athenian
army
not
much
reliance
could
be
placed
on
their
authority
if
unsupported
by
other
evidence
but
a
calculation
made
from
the
number
of
the
athenian
free
population
remarkably
confirms
it
for
the
data
of
this
see
boeck
public
economy
of
athens
vol
some
metoikoi
probably
served
as
hoplites
at
marathon
but
the
number
of
resident
aliens
at
athens
can
not
have
been
large
at
this
period
with
one
exception
the
other
greeks
held
back
from
aiding
them
sparta
had
promised
assistance
but
the
persians
had
landed
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
moon
and
a
religious
scruple
delayed
the
march
of
spartan
troops
till
the
moon
should
have
reached
its
full
from
one
quarter
only
and
that
a
most
unexpected
one
did
athens
receive
aid
at
the
moment
of
her
great
peril
for
some
years
before
this
time
the
little
state
of
plataea
in
boeotia
being
hard
pressed
by
her
powerful
neighbour
thebes
had
asked
the
protection
of
athens
and
had
owed
to
an
athenian
army
the
rescue
of
her
independence
now
when
it
was
noised
over
greece
that
the
mede
had
come
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
to
destroy
athens
the
brave
plataeans
unsolicited
marched
with
their
whole
force
to
assist
in
the
defence
and
to
share
the
fortunes
of
their
benefactors
the
general
levy
of
the
plataeans
only
amounted
to
a
thousand
men
and
this
little
column
marching
from
their
city
along
the
southern
ridge
of
mount
cithaeron
and
thence
across
the
attic
territory
joined
the
athenian
forces
above
marathon
almost
immediately
before
the
battle
the
reinforcement
was
numerically
small
but
the
gallant
spirit
of
the
men
who
composed
it
must
have
made
it
of
tenfold
value
to
the
athenians
and
its
presence
must
have
gone
far
to
dispel
the
cheerless
feeling
of
being
deserted
and
friendless
which
the
delay
of
the
spartan
succours
was
calculated
to
create
among
the
athenian
ranks
this
generous
daring
of
their
weak
but
ally
was
never
forgotten
at
athens
the
plataeans
were
made
the
of
the
athenians
except
the
right
of
exercising
certain
political
functions
and
from
that
time
forth
in
the
solemn
sacrifices
at
athens
the
public
prayers
were
offered
up
for
a
joint
blessing
from
heaven
upon
the
athenians
and
the
plataeans
also
grote
observes
vol
iv
that
this
volunteer
march
of
the
whole
plataean
force
to
marathon
is
one
of
the
most
affecting
incidents
of
all
grecian
history
in
truth
the
whole
career
of
plataea
and
the
friendship
strong
even
unto
death
between
her
and
athens
form
one
of
the
most
affecting
episodes
in
the
history
of
antiquity
in
the
peloponnesian
war
the
plataeans
again
were
true
to
the
athenians
against
all
risks
and
all
calculation
of
and
the
destruction
of
plataea
was
the
consequence
there
are
few
nobler
passages
in
the
classics
than
the
speech
in
which
the
plataean
prisoners
of
war
after
the
memorable
siege
of
their
city
justify
before
their
spartan
executioners
their
loyal
adherence
to
athens

secs
after
the
junction
of
the
column
from
plataea
the
athenians
commanders
must
have
had
under
them
about
eleven
thousand
and
disciplined
infantry
and
probably
a
larger
number
of
irregular
troops
as
besides
the
poorer
citizens
who
went
to
the
field
armed
with
javelins
cutlasses
and
targets
each
regular
soldier
was
attended
in
the
camp
by
one
or
more
slaves
who
were
armed
like
the
inferior
freemen
at
the
battle
of
plataea

eight
thousand

the
athenians
on
this
occasion
had
none
and
the
use
in
the
field
of
military
engines
was
not
at
that
period
introduced
into
ancient
warfare
contrasted
with
their
own
scanty
forces
the
greek
commanders
saw
stretched
before
them
along
the
shores
of
the
winding
bay
the
tents
and
shipping
of
the
varied
nations
that
marched
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
king
of
the
eastern
world
the
difficulty
of
finding
transports
and
of
securing
provisions
would
form
the
only
limit
to
the
numbers
of
a
persian
army
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
suppose
the
estimate
of
justin
exaggerated
who
rates
at
a
hundred
thousand
the
force
which
on
this
occasion
had
sailed
under
the
satraps
datis
and
artaphernes
from
the
cilician
shores
against
the
devoted
coasts
of
euboea
and
attica
and
after
largely
deducting
from
this
total
so
as
to
allow
for
mere
mariners
and
camp
followers
there
must
still
have
remained
fearful
odds
against
the
national
levies
of
the
athenians
nor
could
greek
generals
then
feel
that
confidence
in
the
superior
quality
of
their
troops
which
ever
since
the
battle
of
marathon
has
animated
europeans
in
conflicts
with
asiatics
as
for
instance
in
the
after
struggles
between
greece
and
persia
or
when
the
roman
legions
encountered
the
myriads
of
mithridates
and
tigranes
or
as
is
the
case
in
the
indian
campaigns
of
our
own
regiments
on
the
contrary
up
to
the
day
of
marathon
the
medes
and
persians
were
reputed
invincible
they
had
more
than
once
met
greek
troops
in
asia
minor
in
cyprus
in
egypt
and
had
invariably
beaten
them
nothing
can
be
stronger
than
the
expressions
used
by
the
early
creek
writers
respecting
the
terror
which
the
name
of
the
medes
inspired
and
the
prostration
of
men
spirits
before
the
apparently
resistless
career
of
the
persian
arms
it
is
therefore
little
to
be
wondered
at
that
five
of
the
ten
athenian
generals
shrank
from
the
prospect
of
fighting
a
pitched
battle
against
an
enemy
so
superior
in
numbers
and
so
formidable
in
military
renown
their
own
position
on
the
heights
was
strong
and
offered
great
advantages
to
a
small
defending
force
against
assailing
masses
they
deemed
it
mere
foolhardiness
to
descend
into
the
plain
to
be
trampled
down
by
the
asiatic
horse
overwhelmed
with
the
archery
or
cut
to
pieces
by
the
invincible
veterans
of
cambyses
and
cyrus
moreover
sparta
the
great
of
greece
had
been
applied
to
and
had
promised
succour
to
athens
though
the
religious
observance
which
the
dorians
paid
to
certain
times
and
seasons
had
for
the
present
delayed
their
march
was
it
not
wise
at
any
rate
to
wait
till
the
spartans
came
up
and
to
have
the
help
of
the
best
troops
in
greece
before
they
exposed
themselves
to
the
shock
of
the
dreaded
medes
specious
as
these
reasons
might
appear
the
other
five
generals
were
for
speedier
and
bolder
operations
and
fortunately
for
athens
and
for
the
world
one
of
them
was
a
man
not
only
of
the
highest
military
genius
but
also
of
that
energetic
character
which
impresses
its
own
type
and
ideas
upon
spirits
feebler
in
conception
miltiades
was
the
head
of
one
of
the
noblest
houses
at
athens
he
ranked
the
aeacidae
among
his
ancestry
and
the
blood
of
achilles
flowed
in
the
veins
of
the
hero
of
marathon
one
of
his
immediate
ancestors
had
acquired
the
dominion
of
the
thracian
chersonese
and
thus
the
family
became
at
the
same
time
athenian
citizens
and
thracian
princes
this
occurred
at
the
time
when
pisistratus
was
tyrant
of
athens
two
of
the
relatives
of
miltiades
an
uncle
of
the
same
name
and
a
brother
named
stesagoras
had
ruled
the
chersonese
before
miltiades
became
its
prince
he
had
been
brought
up
at
athens
in
the
house
of
his
father
cimon
herodotus
lib
vi
who
was
renowned
throughout
greece
for
his
victories
in
the
olympic
and
who
must
have
been
possessed
of
great
wealth
the
sons
of
pisistratus
who
succeeded
their
father
in
the
tyranny
at
athens
caused
cimon
to
be
assassinated
but
they
treated
the
young
miltiades
with
favour
and
kindness
and
when
his
brother
stesagoras
died
in
the
chersonese
they
sent
him
out
there
as
lord
of
the
principality
this
was
about
years
before
the
battle
of
marathon
and
it
is
with
his
arrival
in
the
chersonese
that
our
first
knowledge
of
the
career
and
character
of
miltiades
commences
we
find
in
the
first
act
recorded
of
him
proof
of
the
same
resolute
and
unscrupulous
spirit
that
marked
his
mature
age
his
brother
authority
in
the
principality
had
been
shaken
by
war
and
revolt
miltiades
determined
to
rule
more
securely
on
his
arrival
he
kept
close
within
his
house
as
if
he
was
mourning
for
his
brother
the
principal
men
of
the
chersonese
hearing
of
this
assembled
from
all
the
towns
and
districts
and
went
together
to
the
house
of
miltiades
on
a
visit
of
condolence
as
soon
as
he
had
thus
got
them
in
his
power
he
made
them
all
prisoners
he
then
asserted
and
maintained
his
own
absolute
authority
in
the
peninsula
taking
into
his
pay
a
body
of
five
hundred
regular
troops
and
strengthening
his
interest
by
marrying
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
neighbouring
thracians
when
the
persian
power
was
extended
to
the
hellespont
and
its
neighbourhood
miltiades
as
prince
of
the
chersonese
submitted
to
king
darius
and
he
was
one
of
the
numerous
tributary
rulers
who
led
their
contingents
of
men
to
serve
in
the
persian
army
in
the
expedition
against
scythia
miltiades
and
the
vassal
greeks
of
asia
minor
were
left
by
the
persian
king
in
charge
of
the
bridge
across
the
danube
when
the
invading
army
crossed
that
river
and
plunged
into
the
wilds
of
the
country
that
now
is
russia
in
vain
pursuit
of
the
ancestors
of
the
modern
cossacks
on
learning
the
reverses
that
darius
met
with
in
the
scythian
wilderness
miltiades
proposed
to
his
companions
that
they
should
break
the
bridge
down
and
leave
the
persian
king
and
his
army
to
perish
by
famine
and
the
scythian
arrows
the
rulers
of
the
asiatic
greek
cities
whom
miltiades
addressed
shrank
from
this
bold
and
ruthless
stroke
against
the
persian
power
and
darius
returned
in
safety
but
it
was
known
what
advice
miltiades
had
given
and
the
vengeance
of
darius
was
thenceforth
specially
directed
against
the
man
who
had
counselled
such
a
deadly
blow
against
his
empire
and
his
person
the
occupation
of
the
persian
arms
in
other
quarters
left
miltiades
for
some
years
after
this
in
possession
of
the
chersonese
but
it
was
precarious
and
interrupted
he
however
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
which
his
position
gave
him
of
conciliating
the
goodwill
of
his
at
athens
by
conquering
and
placing
under
athenian
authority
the
islands
of
lemnos
and
imbros
to
which
athens
had
ancient
claims
but
which
she
had
never
previously
been
able
to
bring
into
complete
subjection
at
length
in
the
complete
suppression
of
the
ionian
revolt
by
the
persians
left
their
armies
and
fleets
at
liberty
to
act
against
the
enemies
of
the
great
king
to
the
west
of
the
hellespont
a
strong
squadron
of
phoenician
galleys
was
sent
against
the
chersonese
miltiades
knew
that
resistance
was
hopeless
and
while
the
phoenicians
were
at
tenedos
he
loaded
five
galleys
with
all
the
treasure
that
he
could
collect
and
sailed
away
for
athens
the
phoenicians
fell
in
with
him
and
chased
him
hard
along
the
north
of
the
aegean
one
of
his
galleys
on
board
of
which
was
his
eldest
son
metiochus
was
actually
captured
but
miltiades
with
the
other
four
succeeded
in
reaching
the
friendly
coast
of
imbros
in
safety
thence
he
afterwards
proceeded
to
athens
and
resumed
his
station
as
a
free
citizen
of
the
athenian
commonwealth
the
athenians
at
this
time
had
recently
expelled
hippias
the
son
of
pisistratus
the
last
of
their
tyrants
they
were
in
the
full
glow
of
their
liberty
and
equality
and
the
constitutional
changes
of
cleisthenes
had
inflamed
their
republican
zeal
to
the
utmost
miltiades
had
enemies
at
athens
and
these
availing
themselves
of
the
state
of
popular
feeling
brought
him
to
trial
for
his
life
for
having
been
tyrant
of
the
chersonese
the
charge
did
not
necessarily
import
any
acts
of
cruelty
or
wrong
to
individuals
it
was
founded
on
so
specific
law
but
it
was
based
on
the
horror
with
which
the
greeks
of
that
age
regarded
every
man
who
made
himself
compulsory
master
of
his
and
exercised
irresponsible
dominion
over
them
the
fact
of
miltiades
having
so
ruled
in
the
chersonese
was
undeniable
but
the
question
which
the
athenians
assembled
in
judgment
must
have
tried
was
whether
miltiades
by
becoming
tyrant
of
the
chersonese
deserved
punishment
as
an
athenian
citizen
the
eminent
service
that
he
had
done
the
state
in
conquering
lemnos
and
imbros
for
it
pleaded
strongly
in
his
favour
the
people
refused
to
convict
him
he
stood
high
in
public
opinion
and
when
the
coming
invasion
of
the
persians
was
known
the
people
wisely
elected
him
one
of
their
generals
for
the
year
two
other
men
of
signal
eminence
in
history
though
their
renown
was
achieved
at
a
later
period
than
that
of
miltiades
were
also
among
the
ten
athenian
generals
at
marathon
one
was
themistocles
the
future
founder
of
the
athenian
navy
and
the
destined
victor
of
salamis
the
other
was
aristides
who
afterwards
led
the
athenian
troops
at
plataea
and
whose
integrity
and
just
popularity
acquired
for
his
country
when
the
persians
had
finally
been
repulsed
the
advantageous
of
being
acknowledged
by
half
of
the
greeks
as
their
impartial
leader
and
protector
it
is
not
recorded
what
part
either
themistocles
or
aristides
took
in
the
debate
of
the
council
of
war
at
marathon
but
from
the
character
of
themistocles
his
boldness
and
his
intuitive
genius
for
extemporizing
the
best
measures
in
every
emergency
a
quality
which
the
greatest
of
historians
ascribes
to
him
beyond
all
his
contemporaries
we
may
well
believe
that
the
vote
of
themistocles
was
for
prompt
and
decisive
action
see
the
character
of
themistocles
in
the
section
of
the
first
book
of
thucydides
especially
the
last
sentence
on
the
vote
of
aristides
it
may
be
more
difficult
to
speculate
his
predilection
for
the
spartans
may
have
made
him
wish
to
wait
till
they
came
up
but
though
circumspect
he
was
neither
timid
as
a
soldier
nor
as
a
politician
and
the
bold
advice
of
miltiades
may
probably
have
found
in
aristides
a
willing
most
assuredly
it
found
in
him
a
candid
hearer
miltiades
felt
no
hesitation
as
to
the
course
which
the
athenian
army
ought
to
pursue
and
earnestly
did
he
press
his
opinion
on
his
practically
acquainted
with
the
organization
of
the
persian
armies
miltiades
was
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
the
greek
troops
if
properly
handled
he
saw
with
the
military
eye
of
a
great
general
the
advantage
which
the
position
of
the
forces
gave
him
for
a
sudden
attack
and
as
a
profound
politician
he
felt
the
perils
of
remaining
inactive
and
of
giving
treachery
time
to
ruin
the
athenian
cause
one
officer
in
the
council
of
war
had
not
yet
voted
this
was
callimachus
the
the
votes
of
the
generals
were
five
and
five
so
that
the
voice
of
callimachus
would
be
decisive
on
that
vote
in
all
human
probability
the
destiny
of
all
the
nations
of
the
world
depended
miltiades
turned
to
him
and
in
simple
soldierly
eloquence
the
substance
of
which
we
may
read
faithfully
reported
in
herodotus
who
had
conversed
with
the
veterans
of
marathon
the
great
athenian
thus
adjured
his
countryman
to
vote
for
giving
battle
it
now
rests
with
you
callimachus
either
to
enslave
athens
or
by
assuring
her
freedom
to
win
yourself
an
immortality
of
fame
such
as
not
even
harmodius
and
aristogeiton
have
acquired
for
never
since
the
athenians
were
a
people
were
they
in
such
danger
as
they
are
in
at
this
moment
if
they
bow
the
knee
to
these
medes
they
are
to
be
given
up
to
hippias
and
you
know
what
they
then
will
have
to
suffer
but
if
athens
comes
victorious
out
of
this
contest
she
has
it
in
her
to
become
the
first
city
of
greece
your
vote
is
to
decide
whether
we
are
to
join
battle
or
not
if
we
do
not
bring
on
a
battle
presently
some
factious
intrigue
will
disunite
the
athenians
and
the
city
will
be
betrayed
to
the
medes
but
if
we
fight
before
there
is
anything
rotten
in
the
state
of
athens
i
believe
that
provided
the
gods
will
give
fair
play
and
no
favour
we
are
able
to
get
the
best
of
it
in
the
engagement

the
section
is
to
my
mind
clear
proof
that
herodotus
had
personally
conversed
with
epizelus
one
of
the
veterans
of
marathon
the
substance
of
the
speech
of
miltiades
would
naturally
become
known
by
the
report
of
some
of
his
colleagues
the
vote
of
the
brave
was
gained
the
council
determined
to
give
battle
and
such
was
the
ascendancy
and
military
eminence
of
miltiades
that
his
one
and
all
gave
up
their
days
of
command
to
him
and
cheerfully
acted
under
his
orders
fearful
however
of
creating
any
jealousy
and
of
so
failing
to
obtain
the
of
all
parts
of
his
small
army
miltiades
waited
till
the
day
when
the
chief
command
would
have
come
round
to
him
in
regular
rotation
before
he
led
the
troops
against
the
enemy
the
inaction
of
the
asiatic
commanders
during
this
interval
appears
strange
at
first
sight
but
hippias
was
with
them
and
they
and
he
were
aware
of
their
chance
of
a
bloodless
conquest
through
the
machinations
of
his
partisans
among
the
athenians
the
nature
of
the
ground
also
explains
in
many
points
the
tactics
of
the
opposite
generals
before
the
battle
as
well
as
the
operations
of
the
troops
during
the
engagement
the
plain
of
marathon
which
is
about
miles
distant
from
athens
lies
along
the
bay
of
the
same
name
on
the
coast
of
attica
the
plain
is
nearly
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
and
about
six
miles
in
length
it
is
about
two
miles
broad
in
the
centre
where
the
space
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
is
greatest
but
it
narrows
towards
either
extremity
the
mountains
coming
close
down
to
the
water
at
the
horns
of
the
bay
there
is
a
valley
trending
inwards
from
the
middle
of
the
plain
and
a
ravine
comes
down
to
it
to
the
southward
elsewhere
it
is
closely
girt
round
on
the
land
side
by
rugged
limestone
mountains
which
are
thickly
studded
with
pines
and
cedars
and
overgrown
with
the
myrtle
arbutus
and
the
other
low
odoriferous
shrubs
that
everywhere
perfume
the
attic
air
the
level
of
the
ground
is
now
varied
by
the
mound
raised
over
those
who
fell
in
the
battle
but
it
was
an
unbroken
plain
when
the
persians
encamped
on
it
there
are
marshes
at
each
end
which
are
dry
in
spring
and
summer
and
then
offer
no
obstruction
to
the
horseman
but
are
commonly
flooded
with
rain
and
so
rendered
impracticable
for
cavalry
in
the
autumn
the
time
of
year
at
which
the
action
took
place
the
greeks
lying
encamped
on
the
mountains
could
watch
every
movement
of
the
persians
on
the
plain
below
while
they
were
enabled
completely
to
mask
their
own
miltiades
also
had
from
his
position
the
power
of
giving
battle
whenever
he
pleased
or
of
delaying
it
at
his
discretion
unless
datis
were
to
attempt
the
perilous
operation
of
storming
the
heights
if
we
turn
to
the
map
of
the
old
world
to
test
the
comparative
territorial
resources
of
the
two
states
whose
armies
were
now
about
to
come
into
conflict
the
immense
preponderance
of
the
material
power
of
the
persian
king
over
that
of
the
athenian
republic
is
more
striking
than
any
similar
contrast
which
history
can
supply
it
has
been
truly
remarked
that
in
estimating
mere
areas
attica
containing
on
its
whole
surface
only
seven
hundred
square
miles
shrinks
into
insignificance
if
compared
with
many
a
baronial
fief
of
the
middle
ages
or
many
a
colonial
allotment
of
modern
times
its
antagonist
the
persian
empire
comprised
the
whole
of
modern
asiatic
and
much
of
modern
european
turkey
the
modern
kingdom
of
persia
and
the
countries
of
modern
georgia
armenia
balkh
the
punjaub
affghanistan
beloochistan
egypt
and
tripoli
nor
could
a
european
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
before
our
era
look
upon
this
huge
accumulation
of
power
beneath
the
sceptre
of
a
single
asiatic
ruler
with
the
indifference
with
which
we
now
observe
on
the
map
the
extensive
dominions
of
modern
oriental
sovereigns
for
as
has
been
already
remarked
before
marathon
was
fought
the
prestige
of
success
and
of
supposed
superiority
of
race
was
on
the
side
of
the
asiatic
against
the
european
asia
was
the
original
seat
of
human
societies
and
long
before
any
trace
can
be
found
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
rest
of
the
world
having
emerged
from
the
rudest
barbarism
we
can
perceive
that
mighty
and
brilliant
empires
flourished
in
the
asiatic
continent
they
appear
before
us
through
the
twilight
of
primeval
history
dim
and
indistinct
but
massive
and
majestic
like
mountains
in
the
early
dawn
instead
however
of
the
infinite
variety
and
restless
change
which
have
characterised
the
institutions
and
fortunes
of
european
states
ever
since
the
commencement
of
the
civilization
of
our
continent
a
monotonous
uniformity
pervades
the
histories
of
nearly
all
oriental
empires
from
the
most
ancient
down
to
the
most
recent
times
they
are
characterised
by
the
rapidity
of
their
early
conquests
by
the
immense
extent
of
the
dominions
comprised
in
them
by
the
establishment
of
a
satrap
or
pacha
system
of
governing
the
provinces
by
an
invariable
and
speedy
degeneracy
in
the
princes
of
the
royal
house
the
effeminate
nurslings
of
the
seraglio
succeeding
to
the
reared
in
the
camp
and
by
the
internal
anarchy
and
insurrections
which
indicate
and
accelerate
the
decline
and
fall
of
those
unwieldy
and
fabrics
of
power
it
is
also
a
striking
fact
that
the
governments
of
all
the
great
asiatic
empires
have
in
all
ages
been
absolute
despotisms
and
heeren
is
right
in
connecting
this
with
another
great
fact
which
is
important
from
its
influence
both
on
the
political
and
the
social
life
of
asiatics
among
all
the
considerable
nations
of
inner
asia
the
paternal
government
of
every
household
was
corrupted
by
polygamy
where
that
custom
exists
a
good
political
constitution
is
impossible
fathers
being
converted
into
domestic
despots
are
ready
to
pay
the
same
abject
obedience
to
their
sovereign
which
they
exact
from
their
family
and
dependants
in
their
domestic
economy
we
should
bear
in
mind
also
the
inseparable
connexion
between
the
state
religion
and
all
legislation
which
has
always
prevailed
in
the
east
and
the
constant
existence
of
a
powerful
sacerdotal
body
exercising
some
check
though
precarious
and
irregular
over
the
throne
itself
grasping
at
all
civil
administration
claiming
the
supreme
control
of
education
stereotyping
the
lines
in
which
literature
and
science
must
move
and
limiting
the
extent
to
which
it
shall
be
lawful
for
the
human
mind
to
prosecute
its
inquiries
with
these
general
characteristics
rightly
felt
and
understood
it
becomes
a
comparatively
easy
task
to
investigate
and
appreciate
the
origin
progress
and
principles
of
oriental
empires
in
general
as
well
as
of
the
persian
monarchy
in
particular
and
we
are
thus
better
enabled
to
appreciate
the
repulse
which
greece
gave
to
the
arms
of
the
east
and
to
judge
of
the
probable
consequences
to
human
civilization
if
the
persians
had
succeeded
in
bringing
europe
under
their
yoke
as
they
had
already
subjugated
the
fairest
portions
of
the
rest
of
the
then
known
world
the
greeks
from
their
geographical
position
formed
the
natural
vanguard
of
european
liberty
against
persian
ambition
and
they
displayed
the
salient
points
of
distinctive
national
character
which
have
rendered
european
civilization
so
far
superior
to
asiatic
the
nations
that
dwelt
in
ancient
times
around
and
near
the
northern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
sea
were
the
first
in
our
continent
to
receive
from
the
east
the
rudiments
of
art
and
literature
and
the
germs
of
social
and
political
organization
of
these
nations
the
greeks
through
their
vicinity
to
asia
minor
phoenicia
and
egypt
were
among
the
very
foremost
in
acquiring
the
principles
and
habits
of
civilized
life
and
they
also
at
once
imparted
a
new
and
wholly
original
stamp
on
all
which
they
received
thus
in
their
religion
they
received
from
foreign
settlers
the
names
of
all
their
deities
and
many
of
their
rites
but
they
discarded
the
loathsome
monstrosities
of
the
nile
the
orontes
and
the
ganges
they
nationalized
their
creed
and
their
own
poets
created
their
beautiful
mythology
no
sacerdotal
caste
ever
existed
in
greece
so
in
their
governments
they
lived
long
under
hereditary
kings
but
never
endured
the
permanent
establishment
of
absolute
monarchy
their
early
kings
were
constitutional
rulers
governing
with
defined
prerogatives
and
long
before
the
persian
invasion
the
kingly
form
of
government
had
given
way
in
almost
all
the
greek
states
to
republican
institutions
presenting
infinite
varieties
of
the
balancing
or
the
alternate
predominance
of
the
oligarchical
and
democratical
principles
in
literature
and
science
the
greek
intellect
followed
no
beaten
track
and
acknowledged
no
limitary
rules
the
greeks
thought
their
subjects
boldly
out
and
the
novelty
of
a
speculation
invested
it
in
their
minds
with
interest
and
not
with
criminality
versatile
restless
enterprising
and
the
greeks
presented
the
most
striking
contrast
to
the
habitual
quietude
and
submissiveness
of
the
orientals
and
of
all
the
greeks
the
athenians
exhibited
these
national
characteristics
in
the
strongest
degree
this
spirit
of
activity
and
daring
joined
to
a
generous
sympathy
for
the
fate
of
their
in
asia
had
led
them
to
join
in
the
last
ionian
war
and
now
mingling
with
their
abhorrence
of
the
usurping
family
of
their
own
citizens
which
for
a
period
had
forcibly
seized
on
and
exercised
despotic
power
at
athens
it
nerved
them
to
defy
the
wrath
of
king
darius
and
to
refuse
to
receive
back
at
his
bidding
the
tyrant
whom
they
had
some
years
before
driven
from
their
land
the
enterprise
and
genius
of
an
englishman
have
lately
confirmed
by
fresh
evidence
and
invested
with
fresh
interest
the
might
of
the
persian
monarch
who
sent
his
troops
to
combat
at
marathon
inscriptions
in
a
character
termed
the
or
cuneiform
had
long
been
known
to
exist
on
the
marble
monuments
at
persepolis
near
the
site
of
the
ancient
susa
and
on
the
faces
of
rocks
in
other
places
formerly
ruled
over
by
the
early
persian
kings
but
for
thousands
of
years
they
had
been
mere
unintelligible
enigmas
to
the
curious
but
baffled
beholder
and
they
were
often
referred
to
as
instances
of
the
folly
of
human
pride
which
could
indeed
write
its
own
praises
in
the
solid
rock
but
only
for
the
rock
to
outlive
the
language
as
well
as
the
memory
of
the
inscribers
the
elder
niebuhr
grotefend
and
lassen
had
made
some
guesses
at
the
meaning
of
the
cuneiform
letters
but
major
rawlinson
of
the
east
india
company
service
after
years
of
labour
has
at
last
accomplished
the
glorious
achievement
of
fully
revealing
the
alphabet
and
the
grammar
of
this
long
unknown
tongue
he
has
in
particular
fully
deciphered
and
expounded
the
inscriptions
on
the
sacred
rock
of
behistun
on
the
western
frontiers
of
media
these
records
of
the
achaemenidae
have
at
length
found
their
interpreter
and
darius
himself
speaks
to
us
from
the
consecrated
mountain
and
tells
us
the
names
of
the
nations
that
obeyed
him
the
revolts
that
he
suppressed
his
victories
his
piety
and
his
glory
see
the
tenth
volume
of
the
journal
of
the
royal
asiatic
society
kings
who
thus
seek
the
admiration
of
posterity
are
little
likely
to
dim
the
record
of
their
successes
by
the
mention
of
their
occasional
defeats
and
it
throws
no
suspicion
on
the
narrative
of
the
greek
historians
that
we
find
these
inscriptions
silent
respecting
the
overthrow
of
datis
and
artaphernes
as
well
as
respecting
the
reverses
which
darius
sustained
in
person
during
his
scythian
campaigns
but
these
indisputable
monuments
of
persian
fame
confirm
and
even
increase
the
opinion
with
which
herodotus
inspires
us
of
the
vast
power
which
cyrus
founded
and
cambyses
increased
which
darius
augmented
by
indian
and
arabian
conquests
and
seemed
likely
when
he
directed
his
arms
against
europe
to
make
the
predominant
monarchy
of
the
world
with
the
exception
of
the
chinese
empire
in
which
throughout
all
ages
down
to
the
last
few
years
of
the
human
race
has
dwelt
almost
unconnected
with
the
other
portions
all
the
great
kingdoms
which
we
know
to
have
existed
in
ancient

in

northern

assyrians

the
phoenicians
the

as

egypt
and
cyrene
were
persian
provinces
the
greek
colonists

and
the
islands
of
the
aegean
were
darius
subjects
and
their
gallant
but
unsuccessful
attempts
to
throw
off
the
persian
yoke
had
only
served
to
rivet
it
more
strongly
and
to
increase
the
general
belief
that
the
greeks
could
not
stand
before
the
persians
in
a
field
of
battle
darius
scythian
war
though
unsuccessful
in
its
immediate
object

brought
about
the
subjugation
of
thrace
and
the
submission
of
macedonia
from
the
indus
to
the
peneus
all
was
his
we
may
imagine
the
wrath
with
which
the
lord
of
so
many
nations
must
have
heard
nine
years
before
the
battle
of
marathon
that
a
strange
nation
towards
the
setting
sun
called
the
athenians
had
dared
to
help
his
rebels
in
ionia
against
him
and
that
they
had
plundered
and
burnt
the
capital
of
one
of
his
provinces
before
the
burning
of
sardis
darius
seems
never
to
have
heard
of
the
existence
of
athens
but
his
satraps
in
asia
minor
had
for
some
time
seen
athenian
refugees
at
their
provincial
courts
imploring
assistance
against
their
when
hippias
was
driven
away
from
athens
and
the
tyrannic
dynasty
of
the
pisistratidae
finally
overthrown
in
the
banished
tyrant
and
his
adherents
after
vainly
seeking
to
be
restored
by
spartan
intervention
had
betaken
themselves
to
sardis
the
capital
city
of
the
satrapy
of
artaphernes
there
hippias
in
the
expressive
words
of
herodotus
herod
lib
c
began
every
kind
of
agitation
slandering
the
athenians
before
artaphernes
and
doing
all
he
could
to
induce
the
satrap
to
place
athens
in
subjection
to
him
as
the
tributary
vassal
of
king
darius
when
the
athenians
heard
of
his
practices
they
sent
envoys
to
sardis
to
remonstrate
with
the
persians
against
taking
up
the
quarrel
of
the
athenian
refugees
but
artaphernes
gave
them
in
reply
a
menacing
command
to
receive
hippias
back
again
if
they
looked
for
safety
the
athenians
were
resolved
not
to
purchase
safety
at
such
a
price
and
after
rejecting
the
satrap
terms
they
considered
that
they
and
the
persians
were
declared
enemies
at
this
very
crisis
the
ionian
greeks
implored
the
assistance
of
their
european
brethren
to
enable
them
to
recover
their
independence
from
persia
athens
and
the
city
of
eretria
in
euboea
alone
consented
twenty
athenian
galleys
and
five
eretrian
crossed
the
aegean
sea
and
by
a
bold
and
sudden
march
upon
sardis
the
athenians
and
their
allies
succeeded
in
capturing
the
capital
city
of
the
haughty
satrap
who
had
recently
menaced
them
with
servitude
or
destruction
the
persian
forces
were
soon
rallied
and
the
greeks
were
compelled
to
retire
they
were
pursued
and
defeated
on
their
return
to
the
coast
and
athens
took
no
further
part
in
the
ionian
war
but
the
insult
that
she
had
put
upon
the
persian
power
was
speedily
made
known
throughout
that
empire
and
was
never
to
be
forgiven
or
forgotten
in
the
emphatic
simplicity
of
the
narrative
of
herodotus
the
wrath
of
the
great
king
is
thus
described
now
when
it
was
told
to
king
darius
that
sardis
had
been
taken
and
burnt
by
the
athenians
and
ionians
he
took
small
heed
of
the
ionians
well
knowing
who
they
were
and
that
their
revolt
would
soon
be
put
down
but
he
asked
who
and
what
manner
of
men
the
athenians
were
and
when
he
had
been
told
he
called
for
his
bow
and
having
taken
it
and
placed
an
arrow
on
the
string
he
let
the
arrow
fly
towards
heaven
and
as
he
shot
it
into
the
air
he
said
supreme
god
grant
me
that
i
may
avenge
myself
on
the
athenians
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
appointed
one
of
his
servants
to
say
to
him
every
day
as
he
sat
at
meat
remember
the
athenians
some
years
were
occupied
in
the
complete
reduction
of
ionia
but
when
this
was
effected
darius
ordered
his
victorious
forces
to
proceed
to
punish
athens
and
eretria
and
to
conquer
european
greece
the
first
armament
sent
for
this
purpose
was
shattered
by
shipwreck
and
nearly
destroyed
off
mount
athos
but
the
purpose
of
king
darius
was
not
easily
shaken
a
larger
army
was
ordered
to
be
collected
in
cilicia
and
requisitions
were
sent
to
all
the
maritime
cities
of
the
persian
empire
for
ships
of
war
and
for
transports
of
sufficient
size
for
carrying
cavalry
as
well
as
infantry
across
the
aegean
while
these
preparations
were
being
made
darius
sent
heralds
round
to
the
grecian
cities
demanding
their
submission
to
persia
it
was
proclaimed
in
the
of
each
little
hellenic
state
some
with
territories
not
larger
than
the
isle
of
wight
that
king
darius
the
lord
of
all
men
from
the
rising
to
the
setting
sun
required
earth
and
water
to
be
delivered
to
his
heralds
as
a
symbolical
acknowledgment
that
he
was
head
and
master

the

aeschines

speaking
of

mitford
is
probably

in
considering
it
as
the

of

their

the

at

and
at
the
severe

that
had
recently
been
inflicted
on
the
refractory

of
the
continental
greeks
and
nearly
all
the
islanders
submitted
and
gave
the
required
tokens
of
vassalage
at

and
athens
an
indignant
refusal
was
returned
a
refusal
which
was
disgraced
by
outrage
and
violence
against
the
persons
of
the
asiatic
heralds
fresh
fuel
was
thus
added
to
the
anger
of
darius
against
athens
and
the
persian
preparations
went
on
with
renewed
vigour
in
the
summer
of
the
army
destined
for
the
invasion
was
assembled
in
the
aleian
plain
of
cilicia
near
the
sea
a
fleet
of
six
hundred
galleys
and
numerous
transports
was
collected
on
the
coast
for
the
embarkation
of
troops
horse
as
well
as
foot
a
median
general
named
datis
and
artaphernes
the
son
of
the
satrap
of
sardis
and
who
was
also
nephew
of
darius
were
placed
in
titular
joint
command
of
the
expedition
that
the
real
supreme
authority
was
given
to
datis
alone
is
probable
from
the
way
in
which
the
greek
writers
speak
of
him
we
know
no
details
of
the
previous
career
of
this
officer
but
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
his
abilities
and
bravery
had
been
proved
by
experience
or
his
median
birth
would
have
prevented
his
being
placed
in
high
command
by
darius
he
appears
to
have
been
the
first
mede
who
was
thus
trusted
by
the
persian
kings
after
the
overthrow
of
the
conspiracy
of
the
median
magi
against
the
persians
immediately
before
darius
obtained
the
throne
datis
received
instructions
to
complete
the
subjugation
of
greece
and
especial
orders
were
given
him
with
regard
to
eretria
and
athens
he
was
to
take
these
two
cities
and
he
was
to
lead
the
inhabitants
away
captive
and
bring
them
as
slaves
into
the
presence
of
the
great
king
datis
embarked
his
forces
in
the
fleet
that
awaited
them
and
coasting
along
the
shores
of
asia
minor
till
he
was
off
samos
he
thence
sailed
due
westward
through
the
aegean
sea
for
greece
taking
the
islands
in
his
way
the
naxians
had
ten
years
before
successfully
stood
a
siege
against
a
persian
armament
but
they
now
were
too
terrified
to
offer
any
resistance
and
fled
to
the
while
the
enemy
burnt
their
town
and
laid
waste
their
lands
thence
datis
compelling
the
greek
islanders
to
join
him
with
their
ships
and
men
sailed
onward
to
the
coast
of
euboea
the
little
town
of
carystus
essayed
resistance
but
was
quickly
overpowered
he
next
attacked
eretria
the
athenians
sent
four
thousand
men
to
its
aid
but
treachery
was
at
work
among
the
eretrians
and
the
athenian
force
received
timely
warning
from
one
of
the
leading
men
of
the
city
to
retire
to
aid
in
saving
their
own
country
instead
of
remaining
to
share
in
the
inevitable
destruction
of
eretria
left
to
themselves
the
eretrians
repulsed
the
assaults
of
the
persians
against
their
walls
for
six
days
on
the
seventh
day
they
were
betrayed
by
two
of
their
chiefs
and
the
persians
occupied
the
city
the
temples
were
burnt
in
revenge
for
the
burning
of
sardis
and
the
inhabitants
were
bound
and
placed
as
prisoners
in
the
neighbouring
islet
of
aegylia
to
wait
there
till
datis
should
bring
the
athenians
to
join
them
in
captivity
when
both
populations
were
to
be
led
into
upper
asia
there
to
learn
their
doom
from
the
lips
of
king
darius
himself
flushed
with
success
and
with
half
his
mission
thus
accomplished
datis
reimbarked
his
troops
and
crossing
the
little
channel
that
separates
euboea
from
the
mainland
he
encamped
his
troops
on
the
attic
coast
at
marathon
drawing
up
his
galleys
on
the
shelving
beach
as
was
the
custom
with
the
navies
of
antiquity
the
conquered
islands
behind
him
served
as
places
of
deposit
for
his
provisions
and
military
stores
his
position
at
marathon
seemed
to
him
in
every
respect
advantageous
and
the
level
nature
of
the
ground
on
which
he
camped
was
favourable
for
the
employment
of
his
cavalry
if
the
athenians
should
venture
to
engage
him
hippias
who
accompanied
him
and
acted
as
the
guide
of
the
invaders
had
pointed
out
marathon
as
the
best
place
for
a
landing
for
this
very
reason
probably
hippias
was
also
influenced
by
the
recollection
that
years
previously
he
with
his
father
pisistratus
had
crossed
with
an
army
from
eretria
to
marathon
and
had
won
an
easy
victory
over
their
athenian
enemies
on
that
very
plain
which
had
restored
them
to
tyrannic
power
the
omen
seemed
cheering
the
place
was
the
same
but
hippias
soon
learned
to
his
cost
how
great
a
change
had
come
over
the
spirit
of
the
athenians
but
though
the
fierce
democracy
of
athens
was
zealous
and
true
against
foreign
invader
and
domestic
tyrant
a
faction
existed
in
athens
as
at
eretria
of
men
willing
to
purchase
a
party
triumph
over
their
at
the
price
of
their
country
ruin
communications
were
opened
between
these
men
and
the
persian
camp
which
would
have
led
to
a
catastrophe
like
that
of
eretria
if
miltiades
had
not
resolved
and
had
not
persuaded
his
colleagues
to
resolve
on
fighting
at
all
hazards
when
miltiades
arrayed
his
men
for
action
he
staked
on
the
arbitrement
of
one
battle
not
only
the
fate
of
athens
but
that
of
all
greece
for
if
athens
had
fallen
no
other
greek
state
except
lacedaemon
would
have
had
the
courage
to
resist
and
the
lacedaemonians
though
they
would
probably
have
died
in
their
ranks
to
the
last
man
never
could
have
successfully
resisted
the
victorious
persians
and
the
numerous
greek
troops
which
would
have
soon
marched
under
the
persian
satraps
had
they
prevailed
over
athens
nor
was
there
any
power
to
the
westward
of
greece
that
could
have
offered
an
effectual
opposition
to
persia
had
she
once
conquered
greece
and
made
that
country
a
basis
for
future
military
operations
rome
was
at
this
time
in
her
season
of
utmost
weakness
her
dynasty
of
powerful
etruscan
kings
had
been
driven
out
and
her
infant
commonwealth
was
reeling
under
the
attacks
of
the
etruscans
and
volscians
from
without
and
the
fierce
dissensions
between
the
patricians
and
plebeians
within
etruria
with
her
lucumos
and
serfs
was
no
match
for
persia
samnium
had
not
grown
into
the
might
which
she
afterwards
put
forth
nor
could
the
greek
colonies
in
south
italy
and
sicily
hope
to
survive
when
their
parent
states
had
perished
carthage
had
escaped
the
persian
yoke
in
the
time
of
cambyses
through
the
reluctance
of
the
phoenician
mariners
to
serve
against
their
kinsmen
but
such
forbearance
could
not
long
have
been
relied
on
and
the
future
rival
of
rome
would
have
become
as
submissive
a
minister
of
the
persian
power
as
were
the
phoenician
cities
themselves
if
we
turn
to
spain
or
if
we
pass
the
great
mountain
chain
which
prolonged
through
the
pyrenees
the
cevennes
the
alps
and
the
balkan
divides
northern
from
southern
europe
we
shall
find
nothing
at
that
period
but
mere
savage
finns
celts
slaves
and
teutons
had
persia
beaten
athens
at
marathon
she
could
have
found
no
obstacle
to
prevent
darius
the
chosen
servant
of
ormuzd
from
advancing
his
sway
over
all
the
known
western
races
of
mankind
the
infant
energies
of
europe
would
have
been
trodden
out
beneath
universal
conquest
and
the
history
of
the
world
like
the
history
of
asia
would
have
become
a
mere
record
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
despotic
dynasties
of
the
incursions
of
barbarous
hordes
and
of
the
mental
and
political
prostration
of
millions
beneath
the
diadem
the
tiara
and
the
sword
great
as
the
preponderance
of
the
persian
over
the
athenian
power
at
that
crisis
seems
to
have
been
it
would
be
unjust
to
impute
wild
rashness
to
the
policy
of
miltiades
and
those
who
voted
with
him
in
the
athenian
council
of
war
or
to
look
on
the
of
events
as
the
mere
result
of
successful
indiscretion
as
before
has
been
remarked
miltiades
whilst
prince
of
the
chersonese
had
seen
service
in
the
persian
armies
and
he
knew
by
personal
observation
how
many
elements
of
weakness
lurked
beneath
their
imposing
aspect
of
strength
he
knew
that
the
bulk
of
their
troops
no
longer
consisted
of
the
hardy
shepherds
and
mountaineers
from
persia
proper
and
kurdistan
who
won
cyrus
battles
but
that
unwilling
contingents
from
conquered
nations
now
largely
filled
up
the
persian
muster
rolls
fighting
more
from
compulsion
than
from
any
zeal
in
the
cause
of
their
masters
he
had
also
the
sagacity
and
the
spirit
to
appreciate
the
superiority
of
the
greek
armour
and
organization
over
the
asiatic
notwithstanding
former
reverses
above
all
he
felt
and
worthily
trusted
the
enthusiasm
of
the
men
under
his
command
the
athenians
whom
he
led
had
proved
by
their
valour
in
recent
wars
against
the
neighbouring
states
that
liberty
and
equality
of
civic
rights
are
brave
things
and
they
who
while
under
the
yoke
of
a
despot
had
been
no
better
men
of
war
than
any
of
their
neighbours
as
soon
as
they
were
free
became
the
foremost
men
of
all
for
each
felt
that
in
fighting
for
a
free
commonwealth
he
fought
for
himself
and
whatever
he
took
in
hand
he
was
zealous
to
do
the
work
thoroughly
so
the
nearly
contemporaneous
historian
describes
the
change
of
spirit
that
was
seen
in
the
athenians
after
their
tyrants
were
expelled
herod
lib
c
and
miltiades
knew
that
in
leading
them
against
the
invading
army
where
they
had
hippias
the
foe
they
most
hated
before
them
he
was
bringing
into
battle
no
ordinary
men
and
could
calculate
on
no
ordinary
heroism
as
for
traitors
he
was
sure
that
whatever
treachery
might
lurk
among
some
of
the
and
wealthier
athenians
the
rank
and
file
whom
he
commanded
were
ready
to
do
their
utmost
in
his
and
their
own
cause
with
regard
to
future
attacks
from
asia
he
might
reasonably
hope
that
one
victory
would
inspirit
all
greece
to
combine
against
common
foe
and
that
the
latent
seeds
of
revolt
and
disunion
in
the
persian
empire
would
soon
burst
forth
and
paralyse
its
energies
so
as
to
leave
greek
independence
secure
with
these
hopes
and
risks
miltiades
on
the
afternoon
of
a
september
day
gave
the
word
for
the
athenian
army
to
prepare
for
battle
there
were
many
local
associations
connected
with
those
mountain
heights
which
were
calculated
powerfully
to
excite
the
spirits
of
the
men
and
of
which
the
commanders
well
knew
how
to
avail
themselves
in
their
exhortations
to
their
troops
before
the
encounter
marathon
itself
was
a
region
sacred
to
hercules
close
to
them
was
the
fountain
of
macaria
who
had
in
days
of
yore
devoted
herself
to
death
for
the
liberty
of
her
people
the
very
plain
on
which
they
were
to
fight
was
the
scene
of
the
exploits
of
their
national
hero
theseus
and
there
too
as
old
legends
told
the
athenians
and
the
heraclidae
had
routed
the
invader
eurystheus
these
traditions
were
not
mere
cloudy
myths
or
idle
fictions
but
matters
of
implicit
earnest
faith
to
the
men
of
that
day
and
many
a
fervent
prayer
arose
from
the
athenian
ranks
to
the
heroic
spirits
who
while
on
earth
had
striven
and
suffered
on
that
very
spot
and
who
were
believed
to
be
now
heavenly
powers
looking
down
with
interest
on
their
still
beloved
country
and
capable
of
interposing
with
superhuman
aid
in
its
behalf
according
to
old
national
custom
the
warriors
of
each
tribe
were
arrayed
together
neighbour
thus
fighting
by
the
side
of
neighbour
friend
by
friend
and
the
spirit
of
emulation
and
the
consciousness
of
responsibility
excited
to
the
very
utmost
the
callimachus
had
the
leading
of
the
right
wing
the
plataeans
formed
the
extreme
left
and
themistocles
and
aristides
commanded
the
centre
the
line
consisted
of
the
spearmen
only
for
the
greeks
until
the
time
of
iphicrates
took
little
or
no
account
of
soldiers
in
a
pitched
battle
using
them
only
in
skirmishes
or
for
the
pursuit
of
a
defeated
enemy
the
panoply
of
the
regular
infantry
consisted
of
a
long
spear
of
a
shield
helmet
greaves
and
short
sword
thus
equipped
they
usually
advanced
slowly
and
steadily
into
action
in
an
uniform
phalanx
of
about
eight
spears
deep
but
the
military
genius
of
miltiades
led
him
to
deviate
on
this
occasion
from
the
commonplace
tactics
of
his
countrymen
it
was
essential
for
him
to
extend
his
line
so
as
to
cover
all
the
practicable
ground
and
to
secure
himself
from
being
outflanked
and
charged
in
the
rear
by
the
persian
horse
this
extension
involved
the
weakening
of
his
line
instead
of
an
uniform
reduction
of
its
strength
he
determined
on
detaching
principally
from
his
centre
which
from
the
nature
of
the
ground
would
have
the
best
opportunities
for
rallying
if
broken
and
on
strengthening
his
wings
so
as
to
insure
advantage
at
those
points
and
he
trusted
to
his
own
skill
and
to
his
soldiers
discipline
for
the
improvement
of
that
advantage
into
decisive
victory
it
is
remarkable
that
there
is
no
other
instance
of
a
greek
general
deviating
from
the
ordinary
mode
of
bringing
a
phalanx
of
spearmen
into
action
until
the
battles
of
leuctra
and
mantineia
more
than
a
century
after
marathon
when
epaminondas
introduced
the
tactics
which
alexander
the
great
in
ancient
times
and
frederic
the
great
in
modern
times
made
so
famous
of
concentrating
an
overpowering
force
on
some
decisive
point
of
the
enemy
line
while
he
kept
back
or
in
military
phrase
refused
the
weaker
part
of
his
own
in
this
order
and
availing
himself
probably
of
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
so
as
to
conceal
his
preparations
from
the
enemy
till
the
last
possible
moment
miltiades
drew
up
the
eleven
thousand
infantry
whose
spears
were
to
decide
this
crisis
in
the
struggle
between
the
european
and
the
asiatic
worlds
the
sacrifices
by
which
the
favour
of
heaven
was
sought
and
its
will
consulted
were
announced
to
show
propitious
omens
the
trumpet
sounded
for
action
and
chanting
the
hymn
of
battle
the
little
army
bore
down
upon
the
host
of
the
foe
then
too
along
the
mountain
slopes
of
marathon
must
have
resounded
the
mutual
exhortation
which
aeschylus
who
fought
in
both
battles
tells
us
was
afterwards
heard
over
the
waves
of
salamis
on
sons
of
the
greeks
strike
for
the
freedom
of
your
country
strike
for
the
freedom
of
your
children
and
of
your
wives
for
the
shrines
of
your
fathers
gods
and
for
the
sepulchres
of
your
sires
all
all
are
now
staked
upon
the
strife
instead
of
advancing
at
the
usual
slow
pace
of
the
phalanx
miltiades
brought
his
men
on
at
a
run
they
were
all
trained
in
the
exercises
of
the
palaestra
so
that
there
was
no
fear
of
their
ending
the
charge
in
breathless
exhaustion
and
it
was
of
the
deepest
importance
for
him
to
traverse
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
space
of
about
a
mile
of
level
ground
that
lay
between
the
mountain
foot
and
the
persian
outposts
and
so
to
get
his
troops
into
close
action
before
the
asiatic
cavalry
could
mount
form
and
manoeuvre
against
him
or
their
archers
keep
him
long
under
and
before
the
enemy
generals
could
fairly
deploy
their
masses
when
the
persians
says
herodotus
saw
the
athenians
running
down
on
them
without
horse
or
bowmen
and
scanty
in
numbers
they
thought
them
a
set
of
madmen
rushing
upon
certain
destruction
they
began
however
to
prepare
to
receive
them
and
the
eastern
chiefs
arrayed
as
quickly
as
time
and
place
allowed
the
varied
races
who
served
in
their
motley
ranks
mountaineers
from
hyrcania
and
affghanistan
wild
horsemen
from
the
steppes
of
khorassan
the
black
archers
of
ethiopia
swordsmen
from
the
banks
of
the
indus
the
oxus
the
euphrates
and
the
nile
made
ready
against
the
enemies
of
the
great
king
but
no
national
cause
inspired
them
except
the
division
of
native
persians
and
in
the
large
host
there
was
no
uniformity
of
language
creed
race
or
military
system
still
among
them
there
were
many
gallant
men
under
a
veteran
general
they
were
familiarized
with
victory
and
in
contemptuous
confidence
their
infantry
which
alone
had
time
to
form
awaited
the
athenian
charge
on
came
the
greeks
with
one
unwavering
line
of
levelled
spears
against
which
the
light
targets
the
short
lances
and
scymetars
of
the
orientals
offered
weak
defence
the
front
rank
of
the
asiatics
must
have
gone
down
to
a
man
at
the
first
shock
still
they
recoiled
not
but
strove
by
individual
gallantry
and
by
the
weight
of
numbers
to
make
up
for
the
disadvantages
of
weapons
and
tactics
and
to
bear
back
the
shallow
line
of
the
europeans
in
the
centre
where
the
native
persians
and
the
sacae
fought
they
succeeded
in
breaking
through
the
weaker
part
of
the
athenian
phalanx
and
the
tribes
led
by
aristides
and
themistocles
were
after
a
brave
resistance
driven
back
over
the
plain
and
chased
by
the
persians
up
the
valley
towards
the
inner
country
there
the
nature
of
the
ground
gave
the
opportunity
of
rallying
and
renewing
the
struggle
and
meanwhile
the
greek
wings
where
miltiades
had
concentrated
his
chief
strength
had
routed
the
asiatics
opposed
to
them
and
the
athenian
and
plataean
officers
instead
of
pursuing
the
fugitives
kept
their
troops
well
in
hand
and
wheeling
round
they
formed
the
two
wings
together
miltiades
instantly
led
them
against
the
persian
centre
which
had
hitherto
been
triumphant
but
which
now
fell
back
and
prepared
to
encounter
these
new
and
unexpected
assailants
aristides
and
themistocles
renewed
the
fight
with
their
troops
and
the
full
force
of
the
greeks
was
brought
into
close
action
with
the
persian
and
sacian
divisions
of
the
enemy
veterans
strove
hard
to
keep
their
ground
and
evening
aristoph
vesvoe
was
approaching
before
the
stern
encounter
was
decided
but
the
persians
with
their
slight
wicker
shields
destitute
of
and
never
taught
by
training
to
keep
the
even
front
and
act
with
the
regular
movement
of
the
greek
infantry
fought
at
grievous
disadvantage
with
their
shorter
and
feebler
weapons
against
the
compact
array
of
athenian
and
plataean
spearmen
all
perfectly
drilled
to
perform
each
necessary
evolution
in
concert
and
to
preserve
an
uniform
and
unwavering
line
in
battle
in
personal
courage
and
in
bodily
activity
the
persians
were
not
inferior
to
their
adversaries
their
spirits
were
not
yet
cowed
by
the
recollection
of
former
defeats
and
they
lavished
their
lives
freely
rather
than
forfeit
the
fame
which
they
had
won
by
so
many
victories
while
their
rear
ranks
poured
an
incessant
shower
of
arrows
over
the
heads
of
their
comrades
the
foremost
persians
kept
rushing
forward
sometimes
singly
sometimes
in
desperate
groups
of
twelve
or
ten
upon
the
projecting
spears
of
the
greeks
striving
to
force
a
lane
into
the
phalanx
and
to
bring
their
scimetars
and
daggers
into
play
but
the
greeks
felt
their
superiority
and
though
the
fatigue
of
the
action
told
heavily
on
their
inferior
numbers
the
sight
of
the
carnage
that
they
dealt
amongst
their
assailants
nerved
them
to
fight
still
more
fiercely
on
see
the
description
in
the
section
of
the
ninth
book
of
herodotus
of
the
gallantry
shown
by
the
persian
infantry
against
the
lacedaemonians
at
plataea
we
have
no
similar
detail
of
the
fight
at
marathon
but
we
know
that
it
was
long
and
obstinately
contested
see
the
section
of
the
sixth
book
of
herodotus
and
the
lines
from
the
vespae
already
quoted
and
the
spirit
of
the
persians
must
have
been
even
higher
at
marathon
than
at
plataea
in
both
battles
it
was
only
the
true
persians
and
the
sacae
who
showed
this
valour
the
other
asiatics
fled
like
sheep
at
last
the
previously
unvanquished
lords
of
asia
turned
their
backs
and
fled
and
the
greeks
followed
striking
them
down
to
the
water
edge
where
the
invaders
were
now
hastily
launching
their
galleys
and
seeking
to
embark
and
fly
flushed
with
success
the
athenians
dashed
at
the
fleet

flying
mede

shaftless
broken
bow
the
fiery
greek
his
red
pursuing

mountains

plain
below
death
in
the
front
destruction
in
the

such
was
the
byron
childe
harrold
bring
fire
bring
fire
was
their
cry
and
they
began
to
lay
hold
of
the
ships
but
here
the
asiatics
resisted
desperately
and
the
principal
loss
sustained
by
the
greeks
was
in
the
assault
on
the
fleet
here
fell
the
brave
callimachus
the
general
stesilaus
and
other
athenians
of
note
conspicuous
among
them
was
cynaegeirus
the
brother
of
the
tragic
poet
aeschylus
he
had
grasped
the
ornamental
work
on
the
stern
of
one
of
the
galleys
and
had
his
hand
struck
off
by
an
axe
seven
galleys
were
captured
but
the
persians
succeeded
in
saving
the
rest
they
pushed
off
from
the
fatal
shore
but
even
here
the
skill
of
datis
did
not
desert
him
and
he
sailed
round
to
the
western
coast
of
attica
in
hopes
to
find
the
city
unprotected
and
to
gain
possession
of
it
from
some
of
the
partisans
of
hippias
miltiades
however
saw
and
counteracted
his
manoeuvre
leaving
aristides
and
the
troops
of
his
tribe
to
guard
the
spoil
and
the
slain
the
athenian
commander
led
his
conquering
army
by
a
rapid
back
across
the
country
to
athens
and
when
the
persian
fleet
had
doubled
the
cape
of
sunium
and
sailed
up
to
the
athenian
harbour
in
the
morning
datis
saw
arrayed
on
the
heights
above
the
city
the
troops
before
whom
his
men
had
fled
on
the
preceding
evening
all
hope
of
further
conquest
in
europe
for
the
time
was
abandoned
and
the
baffled
armada
returned
to
the
asiatic
coasts
after
the
battle
had
been
fought
but
while
the
dead
bodies
were
yet
on
the
ground
the
promised
reinforcement
from
sparta
arrived
two
thousand
lacedaemonian
spearmen
starting
immediately
after
the
full
moon
had
marched
the
hundred
and
fifty
miles
between
athens
and
sparta
in
the
wonderfully
short
time
of
three
days
though
too
late
to
share
in
the
glory
of
the
action
they
requested
to
be
allowed
to
march
to
the
to
behold
the
medes
they
proceeded
thither
gazed
on
the
dead
bodies
of
the
invaders
and
then
praising
the
athenians
and
what
they
had
done
they
returned
to
lacedaemon
the
number
of
the
persian
dead
was
six
thousand
four
hundred
of
the
athenians
a
hundred
and
the
number
of
plataeans
who
fell
is
not
mentioned
but
as
they
fought
in
the
part
of
the
army
which
was
not
broken
it
can
not
have
been
large
the
apparent
disproportion
between
the
losses
of
the
two
armies
is
not
surprising
when
we
remember
the
armour
of
the
greek
spearmen
and
the
impossibility
of
heavy
slaughter
being
inflicted
by
sword
or
lance
on
troops
so
armed
as
long
as
they
kept
firm
in
their
ranks
mitford
well
refers
to
crecy
poictiers
and
agincourt
as
instances
of
similar
disparity
of
loss
between
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
the
athenian
slain
were
buried
on
the
field
of
battle
this
was
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
according
to
which
the
bones
of
all
who
fell
fighting
for
their
country
in
each
year
were
deposited
in
a
public
sepulchre
in
the
suburb
of
athens
called
the
cerameicus
but
it
was
felt
that
a
distinction
ought
to
be
made
in
the
funeral
honours
paid
to
the
men
of
marathon
even
as
their
merit
had
been
distinguished
over
that
of
all
other
athenians
a
lofty
mound
was
raised
on
the
plain
of
marathon
beneath
which
the
remains
of
the
men
of
athens
who
fell
in
the
battle
were
deposited
ten
columns
were
erected
on
the
spot
one
for
each
of
the
athenian
tribes
and
on
the
monumental
column
of
each
tribe
were
graven
the
names
of
those
of
its
members
whose
glory
it
was
to
have
fallen
in
the
great
battle
of
liberation
the
antiquary
pausanias
read
those
names
there
six
hundred
years
after
the
time
when
they
were
first
graven
the
columns
have
long
perished
but
the
mound
still
marks
the
spot
where
the
noblest
heroes
of
antiquity
the
marathonomakhoi
repose
pausanias
states
with
implicit
belief
that
the
battlefield
was
haunted
at
night
by
supernatural
beings
and
that
the
noise
of
combatants
and
the
snorting
of
horses
were
heard
to
resound
on
it
the
superstition
has
survived
the
change
of
creeds
and
the
shepherds
of
the
neighbourhood
still
believe
that
spectral
warriors
contend
on
the
plain
at
midnight
and
they
say
that
they
have
heard
the
shouts
of
the
combatants
and
the
neighing
of
the
steeds
see
grote
and
thirlwall
a
separate
tumulus
was
raised
over
the
bodies
of
the
slain
plataeans
and
another
over
the
slaves
who
had
taken
part
and
had
fallen
in
the
battle
it
is
probable
that
the
greek
irregulars
were
active
in
the
attack
on
the
persian
ships
and
it
was
in
this
attack
that
the
greeks
suffered
their
principal
loss
there
was
also
a
distinct
sepulchral
monument
to
the
general
to
whose
genius
the
victory
was
mainly
due
miltiades
did
not
live
long
after
his
achievement
at
marathon
but
he
lived
long
enough
to
experience
a
lamentable
reverse
of
his
popularity
and
good
fortune
as
soon
as
the
persians
had
quitted
the
western
coasts
of
the
aegean
he
proposed
to
an
assembly
of
the
athenian
people
that
they
should
fit
out
seventy
galleys
with
a
proportionate
force
of
soldiers
and
military
stores
and
place
them
at
his
disposal
not
telling
them
whither
he
meant
to
proceed
but
promising
them
that
if
they
would
equip
the
force
he
asked
for
and
give
him
discretionary
powers
he
would
lead
it
to
a
land
where
there
was
gold
in
abundance
to
be
won
with
ease
the
greeks
of
that
time
believed
in
the
existence
of
eastern
realms
teeming
with
gold
as
firmly
as
the
europeans
of
the
sixteenth
century
believed
in
eldorado
of
the
west
the
athenians
probably
thought
that
the
recent
victor
of
marathon
and
former
officer
of
darius
was
about
to
guide
them
on
a
secret
expedition
against
some
wealthy
and
unprotected
cities
of
treasure
in
the
persian
dominions
the
armament
was
voted
and
equipped
and
sailed
eastward
from
attica
no
one
but
miltiades
knowing
its
destination
until
the
greek
isle
of
paros
was
reached
when
his
true
object
appeared
in
former
years
while
connected
with
the
persians
as
prince
of
the
chersonese
miltiades
had
been
involved
in
a
quarrel
with
one
of
the
leading
men
among
the
parians
who
had
injured
his
credit
and
caused
some
slights
to
be
put
upon
him
at
the
court
of
the
persian
satrap
hydarnes
the
feud
had
ever
since
rankled
in
the
heart
of
the
athenian
chief
and
he
now
attacked
paros
for
the
sake
of
avenging
himself
on
his
ancient
enemy
his
pretext
as
general
of
the
athenians
was
that
the
parians
had
aided
the
armament
of
datis
with
a
the
parians
pretended
to
treat
about
terms
of
surrender
but
used
the
time
which
they
thus
gained
in
repairing
the
defective
parts
of
the
fortifications
of
their
city
and
they
then
set
the
athenians
at
defiance
so
far
says
herodotus
the
accounts
of
all
the
greeks
agree
but
the
parians
in
after
years
told
also
a
wild
legend
how
a
captive
priestess
of
a
parian
temple
of
the
deities
of
the
earth
promised
miltiades
to
give
him
the
means
of
capturing
paros
how
at
her
bidding
the
athenian
general
went
alone
at
night
and
forced
his
way
into
a
holy
shrine
near
the
city
gate
but
with
what
purpose
it
was
not
known
how
a
supernatural
awe
came
over
him
and
in
his
flight
he
fell
and
fractured
his
leg
how
an
oracle
afterwards
forbad
the
parians
to
punish
the
sacrilegious
and
traitorous
priestess
because
it
was
fated
that
miltiades
should
come
to
an
ill
end
and
she
was
only
the
instrument
to
lead
him
to
evil
such
was
the
tale
that
herodotus
heard
at
paros
certain
it
was
that
miltiades
either
dislocated
or
broke
his
leg
during
an
unsuccessful
siege
of
that
city
and
returned
home
in
evil
plight
with
his
baffled
and
defeated
forces
the
indignation
of
the
athenians
was
proportionate
to
the
hope
and
excitement
which
his
promises
had
raised
xanthippus
the
head
of
one
of
the
first
families
in
athens
indicted
him
before
the
supreme
popular
tribunal
for
the
capital
offence
of
having
deceived
the
people
his
guilt
was
undeniable
and
the
athenians
passed
their
verdict
accordingly
but
the
recollections
of
lemnos
and
marathon
and
the
sight
of
the
fallen
general
who
lay
stretched
on
a
couch
before
them
pleaded
successfully
in
mitigation
of
punishment
and
the
sentence
was
commuted
from
death
to
a
fine
of
fifty
talents
this
was
paid
by
his
son
the
afterwards
illustrious
cimon
miltiades
dying
soon
after
the
trial
of
the
injury
which
he
had
received
at
paros
the
calumnies
against
the
athenians
respecting
miltiades
have
been
well
answered
by
sir
edward
bulwer
lytton
in
his
rise
and
fall
of
athens
and
bishop
thirlwall
in
the
second
volume
of
his
history
of
greece
but
they
have
received
their
most
complete
refutation
from
grote
in
the
fourth
volume
of
his
history
et
and
notes
i
quite
concur
with
him
that
looking
to
the
practice
of
the
athenian
dicastery
in
criminal
cases
fifty
talents
was
the
minor
penalty
actually
proposed
by
the
defenders
of
miltiades
themselves
as
a
substitute
for
the
punishment
of
death
in
those
penal
cases
at
athens
where
the
punishment
was
not
fixed
beforehand
by
the
terms
of
the
law
if
the
person
accused
was
found
guilty
it
was
customary
to
submit
to

as
to
the
amount
of
punishment
first
the
accuser
named
the
penalty
which
he
thought
suitable
next
the
accused
person
was
called
upon
to

an
amount
of
penalty
for
himself
and
the
jurors
were
constrained
to
take
their
choice
between
these
two
no
third
gradation
of
penalty
being
admissible
for
consideration
of
course
under
such
circumstances
it
was
the
interest
of
the
accused
party
to
name
even
in
his
own
case
some
real
and
serious
penalty
something
which
the
jurors
might
be
likely
to
deem
not
wholly
inadequate
to
his
crime
just
proved
for
if
he
proposed
some
penalty
only
trifling
he
drove
them
to
far
the
heavier
sentence
recommended
by
his
opponent
the
stories
of
miltiades
having
been
cast
into
prison
and
died
there
and
of
his
having
been
saved
from
death
only
by
the
interposition
of
the
prytanis
of
the
day
are
i
think
rightly
rejected
by
grote
as
the
fictions
of
after
ages
the
silence
of
herodotus
respecting
them
is
decisive
it
is
true
that
plato
in
the
gorgias
says
that
the
athenians
passed
a
vote
to
throw
miltiades
into
the
barathrum
and
speaks
of
the
interposition
of
the
prytanis
in
his
favour
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
plato
with
all
his
transcendent
genius
was
as
niebuhr
has
termed
him
a
very
indifferent
patriot
who
loved
to
blacken
the
character
of
his
country
democratic
institutions
and
if
the
fact
was
that
the
prytanis
at
the
trial
of
miltiades
opposed
the
vote
of
capital
punishment
and
spoke
in
favour
of
the
milder
sentence
plato
in
a
passage
written
to
show
the
misfortunes
that
befell
athenian
statesmen
would
readily
exaggerate
this
fact
into
the
story
that
appears
in
his
text
the
melancholy
end
of
miltiades
after
his
elevation
to
such
a
height
of
power
and
glory
must
often
have
been
recalled
to
the
mind
of
the
ancient
greeks
by
the
sight
of
one
in
particular
of
the
memorials
of
the
great
battle
which
he
won
this
was
the
remarkable
statue
minutely
described
by
pausanias
which
the
athenians
in
the
time
of
pericles
caused
to
be
hewn
out
of
a
huge
block
of
marble
which
it
was
believed
had
been
provided
by
datis
to
form
a
trophy
of
the
anticipated
victory
of
the
persians
phidias
fashioned
out
of
this
a
colossal
image
of
the
goddess
nemesis
the
deity
whose
peculiar
function
was
to
visit
the
exuberant
prosperity
both
of
nations
and
individuals
with
sudden
and
awful
reverses
this
statue
was
placed
in
a
temple
of
the
goddess
at
rhamnus
about
eight
miles
from
marathon
athens
herself
contained
numerous
memorials
of
her
primary
great
victory
panenus
the
cousin
of
phidias
represented
it
in
fresco
on
the
walls
of
the
painted
porch
and
centuries
afterwards
the
figures
of
miltiades
and
callimachus
at
the
head
of
the
athenians
were
conspicuous
in
the
fresco
the
tutelary
deities
were
exhibited
taking
part
in
the
fray
in
the
were
seen
the
phoenician
galleys
and
nearer
to
the
spectator
the
athenians
and
the
plataeans
distinguished
by
their
leathern
helmets
were
chasing
routed
asiatics
into
the
marshes
and
the
sea
the
battle
was
sculptured
also
on
the
temple
of
victory
in
the
acropolis
and
even
now
there
may
be
traced
on
the
frieze
the
figures
of
the
persian
combatants
with
their
lunar
shields

bows
and

curved
scimetars

these
and
other
memorials
of

were
the
produce
of
the
meridian
age
of
athenian
intellectual
splendour
of
the
age
of
phidias
and
pericles
for
it
was
not
merely
by
the
generation
of
men
whom
the
battle
liberated
from
hippias
and
the
medes
that
the
transcendent
importance
of
their
victory
was
gratefully
recognised
through
the
whole
epoch
of
her
prosperity
through
the
long
olympiads
of
her
decay
through
centuries
after
her
fall
athens
looked
back
on
the
day
of
marathon
as
the
brightest
of
her
national
existence
by
a
natural
blending
of
patriotic
pride
with
grateful
piety
the
very
spirits
of
the
athenians
who
fell
at
marathon
were
deified
by
their
countrymen
the
inhabitants
of
the
districts
of
marathon
paid
religious
rites
to
them
and
orators
solemnly
invoked
them
in
their
most
impassioned
adjurations
before
the
assembled
men
of
athens
nothing
was
omitted
that
could
keep
alive
the
remembrance
of
a
deed
which
had
first
taught
the
athenian
people
to
know
its
own
strength
by
measuring
it
with
the
power
which
had
subdued
the
greater
part
of
the
known
world
the
consciousness
thus
awakened
fixed
its
character
its
station
and
its
destiny
it
was
the
spring
of
its
later
great
actions
and
ambitious
enterprises
thirlwall
it
was
not
indeed
by
one
defeat
however
signal
that
the
pride
of
persia
could
be
broken
and
her
dreams
of
universal
empire
be
dispelled
ten
years
afterwards
she
renewed
her
attempts
upon
europe
on
a
grander
scale
of
enterprise
and
was
repulsed
by
greece
with
greater
and
reiterated
loss
larger
forces
and
heavier
slaughter
than
had
been
seen
at
marathon
signalised
the
conflicts
of
greeks
and
persians
at
artemisium
salamis
plataea
and
the
eurymedon
but
mighty
and
momentous
as
these
battles
were
they
rank
not
with
marathon
in
importance
they
originated
no
new
impulse
they
turned
back
no
current
of
fate
they
were
merely
confirmatory
of
the
already
existing
bias
which
marathon
had
created
the
day
of
marathon
is
the
critical
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
two
nations
it
broke
for
ever
the
spell
of
persian
invincibility
which
had
paralysed
men
minds
it
generated
among
the
greeks
the
spirit
which
beat
back
xerxes
and
afterwards
led
on
xenophon
agesilaus
and
alexander
in
terrible
retaliation
through
their
asiatic
campaigns
it
secured
for
mankind
the
intellectual
treasures
of
athens
the
growth
of
free
institutions
the
liberal
enlightenment
of
the
western
world
and
the
gradual
ascendency
for
many
ages
of
the
great
principles
of
european
civilisation
explanatory
remarks
on
some
of
the
circumstances
of
the
battle
of
marathon
nothing
is
said
by
herodotus
of
the
persian
cavalry
taking
any
part
in
the
battle
although
he
mentions
that
hippias
recommended
the
persians
to
land
at
marathon
because
the
plain
was
favourable
for
cavalry
evolutions
in
the
life
of
miltiades
which
is
usually
cited
as
the
production
of
cornelius
nepos
but
which
i
believe
to
be
of
no
authority
whatever
it
is
said
that
miltiades
protected
his
flanks
from
the
enemy
horse
by
an
abattis
of
felled
trees
while
he
was
on
the
high
ground
he
would
not
have
required
this
defence
and
it
is
not
likely
that
the
persians
would
have
allowed
him
to
erect
it
on
the
plain
bishop
thirlwall
calls
our
attention
to
a
passage
in
suidas
where
the
proverb
khoris
hippeis
is
said
to
have
originated
from
some
ionian
greeks
who
were
serving
compulsorily
in
the
army
of
datis
contriving
to
inform
miltiades
that
the
persian
cavalry
had
gone
away
whereupon
miltiades
immediately
joined
battle
and
gained
the
victory
there
may
probably
be
a
gleam
of
truth
in
this
legend
if
datis
cavalry
was
numerous
as
the
abundant
pastures
of
euboea
were
close
at
hand
the
persian
general
when
he
thought
from
the
inaction
of
his
enemy
that
they
did
not
mean
to
come
down
from
the
heights
and
give
battle
might
naturally
send
the
larger
part
of
his
horse
back
across
the
channel
to
the
neighbourhood
of
eretria
where
he
had
already
left
a
detachment
and
where
his
military
stores
must
have
been
deposited
the
knowledge
of
such
a
movement
would
of
course
confirm
miltiades
in
his
resolution
to
bring
on
a
speedy
engagement
but
in
truth
whatever
amount
of
cavalry
we
suppose
datis
to
have
had
with
him
on
the
day
of
marathon
their
inaction
in
the
battle
is
intelligible
if
we
believe
the
attack
of
the
athenian
spearmen
to
have
been
as
sudden
as
it
was
rapid
the
persian
on
an
alarm
being
given
had
to
take
the
shackles
off
his
horse
to
strap
the
saddle
on
and
bridle
him
besides
equipping
himself
see
xenoph
anab
and
when
each
individual
horseman
was
ready
the
line
had
to
be
formed
and
the
time
that
it
takes
to
form
the
oriental
cavalry
in
line
for
a
charge
has
in
all
ages
been
observed
by
europeans
the
wet
state
of
the
marshes
at
each
end
of
the
plain
in
the
time
of
year
when
the
battle
was
fought
has
been
adverted
to
by
mr
wordsworth
and
this
would
hinder
the
persian
general
from
arranging
and
employing
his
horsemen
on
his
extreme
wings
while
it
also
enabled
the
greeks
as
they
came
forward
to
occupy
the
whole
breadth
of
the
practicable
ground
with
an
unbroken
line
of
levelled
spears
against
which
if
any
persian
horse
advanced
they
would
be
driven
back
in
confusion
upon
their
own
foot
even
numerous
and
bodies
of
cavalry
have
been
repeatedly
broken
both
in
ancient
and
modern
warfare
by
resolute
charges
of
infantry
for
instance
it
was
by
an
attack
of
some
picked
cohorts
that
caesar
routed
the
pompeian
cavalry
which
had
previously
defeated
his
own
at
pharsalia
i
have
represented
the
battle
of
marathon
as
beginning
in
the
afternoon
and
ending
towards
evening
if
it
had
lasted
all
day
herodotus
would
have
probably
mentioned
that
fact
that
it
ended
towards
evening
is
i
think
proved
by
the
line
from
the
vespae
which
i
have
already
quoted
and
to
which
my
attention
was
called
by
sir
edward
bulwer
account
of
the
battle
i
think
that
the
succeeding
lines
in
aristophanes
also
already
quoted
justify
the
description
which
i
have
given

the
of

sought

forces

than
forty

time
she
kept

on

that
enabled
her
to
defeat
her
peloponnesian
enemies
at
cecryphalae
and
aegina
capturing
in
the

engagement
seventy
galleys
this
last
fact
may
give
us
some
idea
of
the
strength
of
the
athenian
that
gained

victory

number

we

to
have

employed

two
hundred
so
as
to
gain
the
aggregate
number
of
the

we
may
form
some
estimate
of
the
forces
which
this
little
greek
state
then
kept
on
foot
between
sixty
and
seventy
thousand
men
must
have
served
in
her
fleets

that
year
her
tenacity
of
purpose
was
equal
to
her
boldness

than
yield

athenians

this
very
time

not
recall
a

crew

had
been

the

expedition
to
sicily
one
of
the
most
decisive
events
in
the
history
of
the
niebuhr
few
cities
have
undergone
more
memorable
sieges
during
ancient
and
mediaeval
times
than
has
the
city
of

athenian
carthaginian
roman

norman
have
in
turns
beleaguered
her
walls
and
the
resistance
which
she
successfully
opposed
to
some
of
her
early
assailants
was
of
the
deepest
importance
not
only
to
the
fortunes
of
the
generations
then
in
being
but
to
all
the
subsequent
current
of
human
events
to
adopt
the
eloquent
expressions
of
arnold
respecting
the
check
which
she
gave
to
the
carthaginian
arms
syracuse
was
a
breakwater
which
god
providence
raised
up
to
protect
the
yet
immature
strength
of
rome
and
her
triumphant
repulse
of
the
great
athenian
expedition
against
her
was
of
even
more
and
enduring
importance
it
forms
a
decisive
epoch
in
the
strife
for
universal
empire
in
which
all
the
great
states
of
antiquity
successively
engaged
and
failed
the
present
city
of
syracuse
is
a
place
of
little
or
no
military
strength
as
the
fire
of
artillery
from
the
neighbouring
heights
would
almost
completely
command
it
but
in
ancient
warfare
its
position
and
the
care
bestowed
on
its
walls
rendered
it
formidably
strong
against
the
means
of
offence
which
then
were
employed
by
besieging
armies
the
ancient
city
in
the
time
of
the
peloponnesian
war
was
chiefly
built
on
the
knob
of
land
which
projects
into
the
sea
on
the
eastern
coast
of
sicily
between
two
bays
one
of
which
to
the
north
was
called
the
bay
of
thapsus
while
the
southern
one
formed
the
great
harbour
of
the
city
of
syracuse
itself
a
small
island
or
peninsula
for
such
it
soon
was
rendered
lies
at
the
extremity
of
this
knob
of
land
stretching
almost
entirely
across
the
mouth
of
the
great
harbour
and
rendering
it
nearly
this
island
comprised
the
original
settlement
of
the
first
greek
colonists
from
corinth
who
founded
syracuse
two
thousand
five
hundred
years
ago
and
the
modern
city
has
shrunk
again
into
these
primary
limits
but
in
the
fifth
century
before
our
era
the
growing
wealth
and
population
of
the
syracusans
had
led
them
to
occupy
and
include
within
their
city
walls
portion
after
portion
of
the
mainland
lying
next
to
the
little
isle
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
athenian
expedition
the
seaward
part
of
the
land
between
the
two
bays
already
spoken
of
was
built
over
and
fortified
from
bay
to
bay
constituting
the
larger
part
of
syracuse
the
landward
wall
therefore
of
the
city
traversed
this
knob
of
land
which
continues
to
slope
upwards
from
the
sea
and
which
to
the
west
of
the
old
fortifications
that
is
towards
the
interior
of
sicily
rises
rapidly
for
a
mile
or
two
but
diminishes
in
width
and
finally
terminates
in
a
long
narrow
ridge
between
which
and
mount
hybla
a
succession
of
chasms
and
uneven
low
ground
extend
on
each
flank
of
this
ridge
the
descent
is
steep
and
precipitous
from
its
summits
to
the
strips
of
level
land
that
lie
immediately
below
it
both
to
the
and
the
usual
mode
of
assailing
fortified
towns
in
the
time
of
the
peloponnesian
war
was
to
build
a
double
wall
round
them
sufficiently
strong
to
check
any
sally
of
the
garrison
from
within
or
any
attack
of
a
relieving
force
from
without
the
interval
within
the
two
walls
of
the
circumvallation
was
roofed
over
and
formed
barracks
in
which
the
besiegers
posted
themselves
and
awaited
the
effects
of
want
or
treachery
among
the
besieged
in
producing
a
surrender
and
in
every
greek
city
of
those
days
as
in
every
italian
republic
of
the
middle
ages
the
rage
of
domestic
sedition
between
aristocrats
and
democrats
ran
high
rancorous
refugees
swarmed
in
the
camp
of
every
invading
enemy
and
every
blockaded
city
was
sure
to
contain
within
its
walls
a
body
of
intriguing
malcontents
who
were
eager
to
purchase
a
at
the
expense
of
a
national
disaster
famine
and
faction
were
the
allies
on
whom
besiegers
relied
the
generals
of
that
time
trusted
to
the
operation
of
these
sure
confederates
as
soon
as
they
could
establish
a
complete
blockade
they
rarely
ventured
on
the
attempt
to
storm
any
fortified
post
for
the
military
engines
of
antiquity
were
feeble
in
breaching
masonry
before
the
improvements
which
the
first
dionysius
effected
in
the
mechanics
of
destruction
and
the
lives
of
spearmen
the
boldest
and
most
would
of
course
have
been
idly
spent
in
charges
against
unshattered
walls
a
city
built
close
to
the
sea
like
syracuse
was
impregnable
save
by
the
combined
operations
of
a
superior
hostile
fleet
and
a
superior
hostile
army
and
syracuse
from
her
size
her
population
and
her
military
and
naval
resources
not
unnaturally
thought
herself
secure
from
finding
in
another
greek
city
a
foe
capable
of
sending
a
sufficient
armament
to
menace
her
with
capture
and
subjection
but
in
the
spring
of
the
athenian
navy
was
mistress
of
her
harbour
and
the
adjacent
seas
an
athenian
army
had
defeated
her
troops
and
cooped
them
within
the
town
and
from
bay
to
bay
a
blockading
wall
was
being
rapidly
carried
across
the
strips
of
level
ground
and
the
high
ridge
outside
the
city
then
termed
epipolae
which
if
completed
would
have
cut
the
syracusans
off
from
all
succour
from
the
interior
of
sicily
and
have
left
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
athenian
generals
the
besiegers
works
were
indeed
unfinished
but
every
day
the
unfortified
interval
in
their
lines
grew
narrower
and
with
it
diminished
all
apparent
hope
of
safety
for
the
beleaguered
town
athens
was
now
staking
the
flower
of
her
forces
and
the
accumulated
fruits
of
seventy
years
of
glory
on
one
bold
throw
for
the
dominion
of
the
western
world
as
napoleon
from
mount
coeur
de
lion
pointed
to
jean
and
told
his
staff
that
the
capture
of
that
town
would
decide
his
destiny
and
would
change
the
face
of
the
world
so
the
athenian
officers
from
the
heights
of
epipolae
must
have
looked
on
syracuse
and
felt
that
with
its
fall
all
the
known
powers
of
the
earth
would
fall
beneath
them
they
must
have
felt
also
that
athens
if
repulsed
there
must
pause
for
ever
in
her
career
of
conquest
and
sink
from
an
imperial
republic
into
a
ruined
and
subservient
community
at
marathon
the
first
in
date
of
the
great
battles
of
the
world
we
beheld
athens
struggling
for
against
the
invading
armies
of
the
east
at
syracuse
she
appears
as
the
ambitious
and
oppressive
invader
of
others
in
her
as
in
other
republics
of
old
and
of
modern
times
the
same
energy
that
had
inspired
the
most
heroic
efforts
in
defence
of
the
national
independence
soon
learned
to
employ
itself
in
daring
and
unscrupulous
schemes
of
at
the
expense
of
neighbouring
nations
in
the
interval
between
the
persian
and
peloponnesian
wars
she
had
rapidly
grown
into
a
conquering
and
dominant
state
the
chief
of
a
thousand
tributary
cities
and
the
mistress
of
the
largest
and
navy
that
the
mediterranean
had
yet
beheld
the
occupations
of
her
territory
by
xerxes
and
mardonius
in
the
second
persian
war
had
forced
her
whole
population
to
become
mariners
and
the
glorious
results
of
that
struggle
confirmed
them
in
their
zeal
for
their
country
service
at
sea
the
voluntary
suffrage
of
the
greek
cities
of
the
coasts
and
islands
of
the
aegean
first
placed
athens
at
the
head
of
the
confederation
formed
for
the
further
prosecution
of
the
war
against
persia
but
this
titular
ascendancy
was
soon
converted
by
her
into
practical
and
arbitrary
dominion
she
protected
them
from
piracy
and
the
persian
power
which
soon
fell
into
decrepitude
and
decay
but
she
exacted
in
return
implicit
obedience
to
herself
she
claimed
and
enforced
a
prerogative
of
taxing
them
at
her
discretion
and
proudly
refused
to
be
accountable
for
her
mode
of
expending
their
supplies
remonstrance
against
her
assessments
was
treated
as
factious
disloyalty
and
refusal
to
pay
was
promptly
punished
as
revolt
permitting
and
encouraging
her
subject
allies
to
furnish
all
their
contingents
in
money
instead
of
part
consisting
of
ships
and
men
the
sovereign
republic
gained
the
double
object
of
training
her
own
citizens
by
constant
and
service
in
her
fleets
and
of
seeing
her
confederates
lose
their
skill
and
discipline
by
inaction
and
become
more
and
more
passive
and
powerless
under
her
yoke
their
towns
were
generally
dismantled
while
the
imperial
city
herself
was
fortified
with
the
greatest
care
and
sumptuousness
the
accumulated
revenues
from
her
tributaries
serving
to
strengthen
and
adorn
to
the
utmost
her
havens
her
docks
her
arsenals
her
theatres
and
her
shrines
and
to
array
her
in
that
plenitude
of
architectural
magnificence
the
ruins
of
which
still
attest
the
intellectual
grandeur
of
the
age
and
people
which
produced
a
pericles
to
plan
and
a
phidias
to
execute
all
republics
that
acquire
supremacy
over
other
nations
rule
them
selfishly
and
oppressively
there
is
no
exception
to
this
in
either
ancient
or
modern
times
carthage
rome
venice
genoa
florence
pisa
holland
and
republican
france
all
tyrannized
over
every
province
and
subject
state
where
they
gained
authority
but
none
of
them
openly
avowed
their
system
of
doing
so
upon
principle
with
the
candour
which
the
athenian
republicans
displayed
when
any
remonstrance
was
made
against
the
severe
exactions
which
they
imposed
upon
their
vassal
allies
they
avowed
that
their
empire
was
a
tyranny
and
frankly
stated
that
they
solely
trusted
to
force
and
terror
to
uphold
it
they
appealed
to
what
they
called
the
eternal
law
of
nature
that
the
weak
should
be
coerced
by
the
strong
thuc
i
sometimes
they
stated
and
not
without
some
truth
that
the
unjust
hatred
of
sparta
against
themselves
forced
them
to
be
unjust
to
others
in
to
be
safe
they
must
be
powerful
and
to
be
powerful
they
must
plunder
and
coerce
their
neighbours
they
never
dreamed
of
communicating
any
franchise
or
share
in
office
to
their
dependents
but
jealously
monopolized
every
post
of
command
and
all
political
and
judicial
power
exposing
themselves
to
every
risk
with
unflinching
gallantry
enduring
cheerfully
the
laborious
training
and
severe
discipline
which
their
required
venturing
readily
on
every
ambitious
scheme
and
never
suffering
difficulty
or
disaster
to
shake
their
tenacity
of
purpose
their
hope
was
to
acquire
unbounded
empire
for
their
country
and
the
means
of
maintaining
each
of
the
thirty
thousand
citizens
who
made
up
the
sovereign
republic
in
exclusive
devotion
to
military
occupations
and
to
those
brilliant
sciences
and
arts
in
which
athens
already
had
reached
the
meridian
of
intellectual
splendour
her
great
political
dramatist
speaks
of
the
athenian
empire
as
comprehending
a
thousand
states
the
language
of
the
stage
must
not
be
taken
too
literally
but
the
number
of
the
dependencies
of
athens
at
the
time
when
the
peloponnesian
confederacy
attacked
her
was
undoubtedly
very
great
with
a
few
trifling
exceptions
all
the
islands
of
the
aegean
and
all
the
greek
cities
which
in
that
age
fringed
the
coasts
of
asia
minor
the
hellespont
and
thrace
paid
tribute
to
athens
and
implicitly
obeyed
her
orders
the
aegean
sea
was
an
attic
lake
westward
of
greece
her
influence
though
strong
was
not
equally
predominant
she
had
colonies
and
allies
among
the
wealthy
and
populous
greek
settlements
in
sicily
and
south
italy
but
she
had
no
organized
system
of
confederates
in
those
regions
and
her
galleys
brought
her
no
tribute
from
the
western
seas
the
extension
of
her
empire
over
sicily
was
the
favourite
project
of
her
ambitious
orators
and
generals
while
her
great
statesman
pericles
lived
his
commanding
genius
kept
his
countrymen
under
control
and
forbade
them
to
risk
the
fortunes
of
athens
in
distant
enterprises
while
they
had
unsubdued
and
powerful
enemies
at
their
own
doors
he
taught
athens
this
maxim
but
he
also
taught
her
to
know
and
to
use
her
own
strength
and
when
pericles
had
departed
the
bold
spirit
which
he
had
fostered
overleaped
the
salutary
limits
which
he
had
prescribed
when
her
bitter
enemies
the
corinthians
succeeded
in
in
inducing
sparta
to
attack
her
and
a
confederacy
was
formed
of
of
the
continental
greeks
all
animated
by
anxious
jealousy
and
bitter
hatred
of
athens
when
armies
far
superior
in
numbers
and
equipment
to
those
which
had
marched
against
the
persians
were
poured
into
the
athenian
territory
and
laid
it
waste
to
the
city
walls
the
general
opinion
was
that
athens
would
in
two
or
three
years
at
the
farthest
be
reduced
to
submit
to
the
requisitions
of
her
invaders
but
her
strong
fortifications
by
which
she
was
girt
and
linked
to
her
principal
haven
gave
her
in
those
ages
almost
all
the
advantages
of
an
insular
position
pericles
had
made
her
trust
to
her
empire
of
the
seas
every
athenian
in
those
days
was
a
practised
seaman
a
state
indeed
whose
members
of
an
age
fit
for
service
at
no
time
exceeded
thirty
thousand
and
whose
territorial
extent
did
not
equal
half
sussex
could
only
have
acquired
such
a
naval
dominion
as
athens
once
held
by
devoting
and
zealously
training
all
its
sons
to
service
in
its
fleets
in
order
to
man
the
numerous
galleys
which
she
sent
out
she
necessarily
employed
also
large
numbers
of
hired
mariners
and
slaves
at
the
oar
but
the
staple
of
her
crews
was
athenian
and
all
posts
of
command
were
held
by
native
citizens
it
was
by
reminding
them
of
this
of
their
long
practice
in
seamanship
and
the
certain
superiority
which
their
discipline
gave
them
over
the
enemy
marine
that
their
great
minister
mainly
encouraged
them
to
resist
the
combined
power
of
lacedaemon
and
her
allies
he
taught
them
that
athens
might
thus
reap
the
fruit
of
her
zealous
devotion
to
maritime
affairs
ever
since
the
invasion
of
the
medes
she
had
not
indeed
perfected
herself
but
the
reward
of
her
superior
training
was
the
rule
of
the
sea
a
mighty
dominion
for
it
gave
her
the
rule
of
much
fair
land
beyond
its
waves
safe
from
the
idle
ravages
with
which
the
lacedaemonians
might
harass
attica
but
never
could
subdue
athens
thuc
lib
sec
athens
accepted
the
war
with
which
her
enemies
threatened
her
rather
than
descend
from
her
pride
of
place
and
though
the
awful
visitation
of
the
plague
came
upon
her
and
swept
away
more
of
her
citizens
than
the
dorian
spear
laid
low
she
held
her
own
gallantly
against
her
foes
if
the
peloponnesian
armies
in
irresistible
strength
wasted
every
spring
her
corn
lands
her
vineyards
and
her
olive
groves
with
fire
and
sword
she
retaliated
on
their
coasts
with
her
fleets
which
if
resisted
were
only
resisted
to
display
the
skill
and
bravery
of
her
seamen
some
of
her
revolted
but
the
revolts
were
in
general
sternly
and
promptly
quelled
the
genius
of
one
enemy
had
indeed
inflicted
blows
on
her
power
in
thrace
which
she
was
unable
to
remedy
but
he
fell
in
battle
in
the
tenth
year
of
the
war
and
with
the
loss
of
brasidas
the
lacedaemonians
seemed
to
have
lost
all
energy
and
judgment
both
sides
at
length
grew
weary
of
the
war
and
in
a
truce
of
fifty
years
was
concluded
which
though
ill
kept
and
though
many
of
the
confederates
of
sparta
refused
to
recognise
it
and
hostilities
still
continued
in
many
parts
of
greece
protected
the
athenian
territory
from
the
ravages
of
enemies
and
enabled
athens
to
accumulate
large
sums
out
of
the
proceeds
of
her
annual
revenues
so
also
as
a
few
years
passed
by
the
havoc
which
the
pestilence
and
the
sword
had
made
in
her
population
was
repaired
and
in
athens
was
full
of
bold
and
restless
spirits
who
longed
for
some
field
of
distant
enterprise
wherein
they
might
signalize
themselves
and
aggrandize
the
state
and
who
looked
on
the
alarm
of
spartan
hostility
as
a
mere
old
woman
tale
when
sparta
had
wasted
their
territory
she
had
done
her
worst
and
the
fact
of
its
always
being
in
her
power
to
do
so
seemed
a
strong
reason
for
seeking
to
increase
the
transmarine
dominion
of
athens
the
west
was
now
the
quarter
towards
which
the
thoughts
of
every
aspiring
athenian
were
directed
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
athens
had
kept
up
an
interest
in
sicily
and
her
squadrons
had
from
time
to
time
appeared
on
its
coasts
and
taken
part
in
the
dissensions
in
which
the
sicilian
greeks
were
universally
engaged
one
against
the
other
there
were
plausible
grounds
for
a
direct
quarrel
and
an
open
attack
by
the
athenians
upon
syracuse
with
the
capture
of
syracuse
all
sicily
it
was
hoped
would
be
secured
carthage
and
italy
were
next
to
be
assailed
with
large
levies
of
iberian
mercenaries
she
then
meant
to
overwhelm
her
peloponnesian
enemies
the
persian
monarchy
lay
in
hopeless
imbecility
inviting
greek
invasion
nor
did
the
known
world
contain
the
power
that
seemed
capable
of
checking
the
growing
might
of
athens
if
syracuse
once
could
be
hers
the
national
historian
of
rome
has
left
us
as
an
episode
of
his
great
work
a
disquisition
on
the
probable
effects
that
would
have
followed
if
alexander
the
great
had
invaded
italy
posterity
has
generally
regarded
that
disquisition
as
proving
livy
patriotism
more
strongly
than
his
impartiality
or
acuteness
yet
right
or
wrong
the
speculations
of
the
roman
writer
were
directed
to
the
consideration
of
a
very
remote
possibility
to
whatever
age
alexander
life
might
have
been
prolonged
the
east
would
have
furnished
full
occupation
for
his
martial
ambition
as
well
as
for
those
schemes
of
commercial
grandeur
and
imperial
amalgamation
of
nations
in
which
the
truly
great
qualities
of
his
mind
loved
to
display
themselves
with
his
death
the
dismemberment
of
his
empire
among
his
generals
was
certain
even
as
the
dismemberment
of
napoleon
empire
among
his
marshals
would
certainly
have
ensued
if
he
had
been
cut
off
in
the
zenith
of
his
power
rome
also
was
far
weaker
when
the
athenians
were
in
sicily
than
she
was
a
century
afterwards
in
alexander
time
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
rome
would
have
been
blotted
out
from
the
independent
powers
of
the
west
had
she
been
attacked
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
by
an
athenian
army
largely
aided
by
spanish
mercenaries
and
flushed
with
triumphs
over
sicily
and
africa
instead
of
the
collision
between
her
and
greece
having
been
deferred
until
the
latter
had
sunk
into
decrepitude
and
the
roman
mars
had
grown
into
full
vigour
the
armament
which
the
athenians
equipped
against
syracuse
was
in
every
way
worthy
of
the
state
which
formed
such
projects
of
universal
empire
and
it
has
been
truly
termed
the
noblest
that
ever
yet
had
been
sent
forth
by
a
free
and
civilized
commonwealth
arnold
history
of
rome
the
fleet
consisted
of
one
hundred
and
war
galleys
with
a
multitude
of
store
ships
a
powerful
force
of
the
best
infantry
that
athens
and
her
allies
could
furnish
was
sent
on
board
together
with
a
smaller
number
of
slingers
and
bowmen
the
quality
of
the
forces
was
even
more
remarkable
than
the
number
the
zeal
of
individuals
vied
with
that
of
the
republic
in
giving
every
galley
the
best
possible
crew
and
every
troop
the
most
perfect
accoutrements
and
with
private
as
well
as
public
wealth
eagerly
lavished
on
all
that
could
give
splendour
as
well
as
efficiency
to
the
expedition
the
fated
fleet
began
its
voyage
for
the
sicilian
shores
in
the
summer
of
the
syracusans
themselves
at
the
time
of
the
peloponnesian
war
were
a
bold
and
turbulent
democracy
tyrannizing
over
the
weaker
greek
cities
in
sicily
and
trying
to
gain
in
that
island
the
same
arbitrary
supremacy
which
athens
maintained
along
the
eastern
coast
of
the
mediterranean
in
numbers
and
in
spirit
they
were
fully
equal
to
the
athenians
but
far
inferior
to
them
in
military
and
naval
discipline
when
the
probability
of
an
athenian
invasion
was
first
publicly
discussed
at
syracuse
and
efforts
were
made
by
some
of
the
wiser
citizens
to
improve
the
state
of
the
national
defences
and
prepare
for
the
impending
danger
the
rumours
of
coming
war
and
the
proposals
for
preparation
were
received
by
the
mass
of
the
syracusans
with
scornful
incredulity
the
speech
of
one
of
their
popular
orators
is
preserved
to
us
in
thucydides
lib
vi
sec
et
arnold
edition
i
have
almost
literally
transcribed
some
of
the
marginal
epitomes
of
the
original
speech
and
many
of
its
topics
might
by
a
slight
alteration
of
names
and
details
serve
admirably
for
the
party
among
ourselves
at
present
which
opposes
the
augmentation
of
our
forces
and
derides
the
idea
of
our
being
in
any
peril
from
the
sudden
attack
of
a
french
expedition
the
syracusan
orator
told
his
countrymen
to
dismiss
with
scorn
the
visionary
terrors
which
a
set
of
designing
men
among
themselves
strove
to
excite
in
order
to
get
power
and
influence
thrown
into
their
own
hands
he
told
them
that
athens
knew
her
own
interest
too
well
to
think
of
wantonly
provoking
their
hostility
even
if
the
enemies
were
to
come
said
he
so
distant
from
their
resources
and
opposed
to
such
a
power
as
ours
their
destruction
would
be
easy
and
inevitable
their
ships
will
have
enough
to
do
to
get
to
our
island
at
all
and
to
carry
such
stores
of
all
sorts
as
will
be
needed
they
can
not
therefore
carry
besides
an
army
large
enough
to
cope
with
such
a
population
as
ours
they
will
have
no
fortified
place
from
which
to
commence
their
operations
but
must
rest
them
on
no
better
base
than
a
set
of
wretched
tents
and
such
means
as
the
necessities
of
the
moment
will
allow
them
but
in
truth
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
even
be
able
to
effect
a
disembarkation
let
us
therefore
set
at
nought
these
reports
as
altogether
of
home
manufacture
and
be
sure
that
if
any
enemy
does
come
the
state
will
know
how
to
defend
itself
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
national
honour
such
assertions
pleased
the
syracusan
assembly
and
their
counterparts
find
favour
now
among
some
portion
of
the
english
public
but
the
invaders
of
syracuse
came
made
good
their
landing
in
sicily
and
if
they
had
promptly
attacked
the
city
itself
instead
of
wasting
nearly
a
year
in
desultory
operations
in
other
parts
of
the
island
the
syracusans
must
have
paid
the
penalty
of
their
carelessness
in
submission
to
the
athenian
yoke
but
of
the
three
generals
who
led
the
athenian
expedition
two
only
were
men
of
ability
and
one
was
most
weak
and
incompetent
fortunately
for
syracuse
alcibiades
the
most
skilful
of
the
three
was
soon
deposed
from
his
command
by
a
factious
and
fanatic
vote
of
his
and
the
other
competent
one
lamachus
fell
early
in
a
skirmish
while
more
fortunately
still
for
her
the
feeble
and
vacillating
nicias
remained
unrecalled
and
unhurt
to
assume
the
undivided
leadership
of
the
athenian
army
and
fleet
and
to
mar
by
alternate
and
every
chance
of
success
which
the
early
part
of
the
operations
offered
still
even
under
him
the
athenians
nearly
won
the
town
they
defeated
the
raw
levies
of
the
syracusans
cooped
them
within
the
walls
and
as
before
mentioned
almost
effected
a
continuous
fortification
from
bay
to
bay
over
epipolae
the
completion
of
which
would
certainly
have
been
followed
by
capitulation
alcibiades
the
most
complete
example
of
genius
without
principle
that
history
produces
the
bolingbroke
of
antiquity
but
with
high
military
talents
superadded
to
diplomatic
and
oratorical
powers
on
being
summoned
home
from
his
command
in
sicily
to
take
his
trial
before
the
athenian
tribunal
had
escaped
to
sparta
and
he
exerted
himself
there
with
all
the
selfish
rancour
of
a
renegade
to
renew
the
war
with
athens
and
to
send
instant
assistance
to
syracuse
when
we
read
his
words
in
the
pages
of
thucydides
who
was
himself
an
exile
from
athens
at
this
period
and
may
probably
have
been
at
sparta
and
heard
alcibiades
speak
we
are
at
loss
whether
most
to
admire
or
abhor
his
subtile
and
traitorous
counsels
after
an
artful
exordium
in
which
he
tried
to
disarm
the
suspicions
which
he
felt
must
be
entertained
of
him
and
to
point
out
to
the
spartans
how
completely
his
interests
and
theirs
were
identified
through
hatred
of
the
athenian
democracy
he
thus
proceeded
hear
me
at
any
rate
on
the
matters
which
require
your
grave
attention
and
which
i
from
the
personal
knowledge
that
i
have
of
them
can
and
ought
to
bring
before
you
we
athenians
sailed
to
sicily
with
the
design
of
subduing
first
the
greek
cities
there
and
next
those
in
italy
then
we
intended
to
make
an
attempt
on
the
dominions
of
carthage
and
on
carthage
itself
arnold
in
his
notes
on
this
passage
well
reminds
the
reader
that
agathocles
with
a
greek
force
far
inferior
to
that
of
the
athenians
at
this
period
did
a
century
afterwards
very
nearly
conquer
carthage
if
all
these
projects
succeeded
nor
did
we
limit
ourselves
to
them
in
these
quarters
we
intended
to
increase
our
fleet
with
the
inexhaustible
supplies
of
ship
timber
which
italy
affords
to
put
in
requisition
the
whole
military
force
of
the
conquered
greek
states
and
also
to
hire
large
armies
of
the
barbarians
of
the
iberians
and
others
in
those
regions
who
are
allowed
to
make
the
best
possible
soldiers
it
will
be
remembered
that
spanish
infantry
were
the
staple
of
the
carthaginian
armies
doubtless
alcibiades
and
other
leading
athenians
had
made
themselves
acquainted
with
the
carthaginian
system
of
carrying
on
war
and
meant
to
adopt
it
with
the
marvellous
powers
which
alcibiades
possessed
of
ingratiating
himself
with
men
of
every
class
and
every
nation
and
his
high
military
genius
he
would
have
been
as
formidable
a
chief
of
an
army
of
condottieri
as
hannibal
afterwards
was
then
when
we
had
done
all
this
we
intended
to
assail
peloponnesus
with
our
collected
force
our
fleets
would
blockade
you
by
sea
and
desolate
your
coasts
our
armies
would
be
landed
at
different
points
and
assail
your
cities
some
of
these
we
expected
to
storm
and
others
we
meant
to
take
by
surrounding
them
with
fortified
lines
alcibiades
here
alluded
to
sparta
itself
which
was
unfortified
his
spartan
hearers
must
have
glanced
round
them
at
these
words
with
mixed
alarm
and
indignation
we
thought
that
it
would
thus
be
an
easy
matter
thoroughly
to
war
you
down
and
then
we
should
become
the
masters
of
the
whole
greek
race
as
for
expense
we
reckoned
that
each
conquered
state
would
give
us
supplies
of
money
and
provisions
sufficient
to
pay
for
its
own
conquest
and
furnish
the
means
for
the
conquest
of
its
neighbours
such
are
the
designs
of
the
present
athenian
expedition
to
sicily
and
you
have
heard
them
from
the
lips
of
the
man
who
of
all
men
living
is
most
accurately
acquainted
with
them
the
other
athenian
generals
who
remain
with
the
expedition
will
endeavour
to
carry
out
these
plans
and
be
sure
that
without
your
speedy
interference
they
will
all
be
accomplished
the
sicilian
greeks
are
deficient
in
military
training
but
still
if
they
could
be
at
once
brought
to
combine
in
an
organised
resistance
to
athens
they
might
even
now
be
saved
but
as
for
the
syracusans
resisting
athens
by
themselves
they
have
already
with
the
whole
strength
of
their
population
fought
a
battle
and
been
beaten
they
can
not
face
the
athenians
at
sea
and
it
is
quite
impossible
for
them
to
hold
out
against
the
force
of
their
invaders
and
if
this
city
falls
into
the
hands
of
the
athenians
all
sicily
is
theirs
and
presently
italy
also
and
the
danger
which
i
warned
you
of
from
that
quarter
will
soon
fall
upon
yourselves
you
must
therefore
in
sicily
fight
for
the
safety
of
peloponnesus
send
some
galleys
thither
instantly
put
men
on
board
who
can
work
their
own
way
over
and
who
as
soon
as
they
land
can
do
duty
as
regular
troops
but
above
all
let
one
of
yourselves
let
a
man
of
sparta
go
over
to
take
the
chief
command
to
bring
into
order
and
effective
discipline
the
forces
that
are
in
syracuse
and
urge
those
who
at
present
hang
back
to
come
forward
and
aid
the
syracusans
the
presence
of
a
spartan
general
at
this
crisis
will
do
more
to
save
the
city
than
a
whole
army
lib
vi
sec
the
renegade
then
proceeded
to
urge
on
them
the
necessity
of
encouraging
their
friends
in
sicily
by
showing
that
they
themselves
were
earnest
in
hostility
to
athens
he
exhorted
them
not
only
to
march
their
armies
into
attica
again
but
to
take
up
a
permanent
fortified
position
in
the
country
and
he
gave
them
in
detail
information
of
all
that
the
athenians
most
dreaded
and
how
his
country
might
receive
the
most
distressing
and
enduring
injury
at
their
hands
the
spartans
resolved
to
act
on
his
advice
and
appointed
gylippus
to
the
sicilian
command
gylippus
was
a
man
who
to
the
national
bravery
and
military
skill
of
a
spartan
united
political
sagacity
that
was
worthy
of
his
great
brasidas
but
his
merits
were
debased
by
mean
and
sordid
vice
and
his
is
one
of
the
cases
in
which
history
has
been
austerely
just
and
where
little
or
no
fame
has
been
accorded
to
the
successful
but
venal
soldier
but
for
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
required
in
sicily
an
abler
man
could
not
have
been
found
in
lacedaemon
his
country
gave
him
neither
men
nor
money
but
she
gave
him
her
authority
and
the
influence
of
her
name
and
of
his
own
talents
was
speedily
seen
in
the
zeal
with
which
the
corinthians
and
other
peloponnesian
greeks
began
to
equip
a
squadron
to
act
under
him
for
the
rescue
of
sicily
as
soon
as
four
galleys
were
ready
he
hurried
over
with
them
to
the
southern
coast
of
italy
and
there
though
he
received
such
evil
tidings
of
the
state
of
syracuse
that
he
abandoned
all
hope
of
saving
that
city
he
determined
to
remain
on
the
coast
and
do
what
he
could
in
preserving
the
italian
cities
from
the
athenians
so
nearly
indeed
had
nicias
completed
his
beleaguering
lines
and
so
utterly
desperate
had
the
state
of
syracuse
seemingly
become
that
an
assembly
of
the
syracusans
was
actually
convened
and
they
were
discussing
the
terms
on
which
they
should
offer
to
capitulate
when
a
galley
was
seen
dashing
into
the
great
harbour
and
making
her
way
towards
the
town
with
all
the
speed
that
her
rowers
could
supply
from
her
shunning
the
part
of
the
harbour
where
the
athenian
fleet
lay
and
making
straight
for
the
syracusan
side
it
was
clear
that
she
was
a
friend
the
enemy
cruisers
careless
through
confidence
of
success
made
no
attempt
to
cut
her
off
she
touched
the
beach
and
a
corinthian
captain
springing
on
shore
from
her
was
eagerly
conducted
to
the
assembly
of
the
syracusan
people
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
fatal
vote
being
put
for
a
surrender
providentially
for
syracuse
gongylus
the
commander
of
the
galley
had
been
prevented
by
an
athenian
squadron
from
following
gylippus
to
south
italy
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
push
direct
for
syracuse
from
greece
the
sight
of
actual
succour
and
the
promise
of
more
revived
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
syracusans
they
felt
that
they
were
not
left
desolate
to
perish
and
the
tidings
that
a
spartan
was
coming
to
command
them
confirmed
their
resolution
to
continue
their
resistance
gylippus
was
already
near
the
city
he
had
learned
at
locri
that
the
first
report
which
had
reached
him
of
the
state
of
syracuse
was
exaggerated
and
that
there
was
an
unfinished
space
in
the
besiegers
lines
through
which
it
was
barely
possible
to
introduce
reinforcements
into
the
town
crossing
the
straits
of
messina
which
the
culpable
negligence
of
nicias
had
left
unguarded
gylippus
landed
on
the
northern
coast
of
sicily
and
there
began
to
collect
from
the
greek
cities
an
army
of
which
the
regular
troops
that
he
brought
from
peloponnesus
formed
the
nucleus
such
was
the
influence
of
the
name
of
sparta
the
effect
of
the
presence
of
a
spartan
officer
on
the
troops
of
the
other
greeks
seems
to
have
been
like
the
effect
of
the
presence
of
an
english
officer
upon
native
indian
troops
and
such
were
his
own
abilities
and
activity
that
he
succeeded
in
raising
a
force
of
about
two
thousand
fully
armed
infantry
with
a
larger
number
of
irregular
troops
nicias
as
if
infatuated
made
no
attempt
to
counteract
his
operations
nor
when
gylippus
marched
his
little
army
towards
syracuse
did
the
athenian
commander
endeavour
to
check
him
the
syracusans
marched
out
to
meet
him
and
while
the
athenians
were
solely
intent
on
completing
their
fortifications
on
the
southern
side
towards
the
harbour
gylippus
turned
their
position
by
occupying
the
high
ground
in
the
extreme
rear
of
epipolae
he
then
marched
through
the
unfortified
interval
of
nicias
lines
into
the
besieged
town
and
joining
his
troops
with
the
syracusan
forces
after
some
engagements
with
varying
success
gained
the
mastery
over
nicias
drove
the
athenians
from
epipolae
and
hemmed
them
into
a
disadvantageous
position
in
the
low
grounds
near
the
great
harbour
the
attention
of
all
greece
was
now
fixed
on
syracuse
and
every
enemy
of
athens
felt
the
importance
of
the
opportunity
now
offered
of
checking
her
ambition
and
perhaps
of
striking
a
deadly
blow
at
her
power
large
reinforcements
from
corinth
thebes
and
other
cities
now
reached
the
syracusans
while
the
baffled
and
dispirited
athenian
general
earnestly
besought
his
countrymen
to
recall
him
and
represented
the
further
prosecution
of
the
siege
as
hopeless
but
athens
had
made
it
a
maxim
never
to
let
difficulty
or
disaster
drive
her
back
from
any
enterprise
once
undertaken
so
long
as
she
possessed
the
means
of
making
any
effort
however
desperate
for
its
accomplishment
with
indomitable
pertinacity
she
now
decreed
instead
of
recalling
her
first
armament
from
before
syracuse
to
send
out
a
second
though
her
enemies
near
home
had
now
renewed
open
warfare
against
her
and
by
occupying
a
permanent
fortification
in
her
territory
had
severely
distressed
her
population
and
were
pressing
her
with
almost
all
the
hardships
of
an
actual
siege
she
still
was
mistress
of
the
sea
and
she
sent
forth
another
fleet
of
seventy
galleys
and
another
army
which
seemed
to
drain
the
very
last
reserves
of
her
military
population
to
try
if
syracuse
could
not
yet
be
won
and
the
honour
of
the
athenian
arms
be
preserved
from
the
stigma
of
a
retreat
hers
was
indeed
a
spirit
that
might
be
broken
but
never
would
bend
at
the
head
of
this
second
expedition
she
wisely
placed
her
best
general
demosthenes
one
of
the
most
distinguished
officers
whom
the
long
peloponnesian
war
had
produced
and
who
if
he
had
originally
held
the
sicilian
command
would
soon
have
brought
syracuse
to
submission
the
fame
of
demosthenes
the
general
has
been
dimmed
by
the
superior
lustre
of
his
great
countryman
demosthenes
the
orator
when
the
name
of
demosthenes
is
mentioned
it
is
the
latter
alone
that
is
thought
of
the
soldier
has
found
no
biographer
yet
out
of
the
long
list
of
the
great
men
of
the
athenian
republic
there
are
few
that
deserve
to
stand
higher
than
this
brave
though
finally
unsuccessful
leader
of
her
fleets
and
armies
in
the
first
half
of
the
peloponnesian
war
in
his
first
campaign
in
aetolia
he
had
shown
some
of
the
rashness
of
youth
and
had
received
a
lesson
of
caution
by
which
he
profited
throughout
the
rest
of
his
career
but
without
losing
any
of
his
natural
energy
in
enterprise
or
in
execution
he
had
performed
the
eminent
service
of
rescuing
naupactus
from
a
powerful
hostile
armament
in
the
seventh
year
of
the
war
he
had
then
at
the
request
of
the
acarnanian
republics
taken
on
himself
the
office
of
of
all
their
forces
and
at
their
head
he
had
gained
some
important
advantages
over
the
enemies
of
athens
in
western
greece
his
most
celebrated
exploits
had
been
the
occupation
of
pylos
on
the
messenian
coast
the
successful
defence
of
that
place
against
the
fleet
and
armies
of
lacedaemon
and
the
subsequent
capture
of
the
spartan
forces
on
the
isle
of
sphacteria
which
was
the
severest
blow
dealt
to
sparta
throughout
the
war
and
which
had
mainly
caused
her
to
humble
herself
to
make
the
truce
with
athens
demosthenes
was
as
honourably
unknown
in
the
war
of
party
politics
at
athens
as
he
was
eminent
in
the
war
against
the
foreign
enemy
we
read
of
no
intrigues
of
his
on
either
the
aristocratic
or
democratic
side
he
was
neither
in
the
interest
of
nicias
nor
of
cleon
his
private
character
was
free
from
any
of
the
stains
which
polluted
that
of
alcibiades
on
all
these
points
the
silence
of
the
comic
dramatist
is
decisive
evidence
in
his
favour
he
had
also
the
moral
courage
not
always
combined
with
physical
of
seeking
to
do
his
duty
to
his
country
irrespectively
of
any
odium
that
he
himself
might
incur
and
unhampered
by
any
petty
jealousy
of
those
who
were
associated
with
him
in
command
there
are
few
men
named
in
ancient
history
of
whom
posterity
would
gladly
know
more
or
whom
we
sympathise
with
more
deeply
in
the
calamities
that
befel
them
than
demosthenes
the
son
of
alcisthenes
who
in
the
spring
of
the
year
left
piraeus
at
the
head
of
the
second
athenian
expedition
against
sicily
his
arrival
was
critically
timed
for
gylippus
had
encouraged
the
syracusans
to
attack
the
athenians
under
nicias
by
sea
as
well
as
by
land
and
by
an
able
stratagem
of
ariston
one
of
the
admirals
of
the
corinthian
auxiliary
squadron
the
syracusans
and
their
confederates
had
inflicted
on
the
fleet
of
nicias
the
first
defeat
that
the
athenian
navy
had
ever
sustained
from
a
numerically
inferior
foe
gylippus
was
preparing
to
follow
up
his
advantage
by
fresh
attacks
on
the
athenians
on
both
elements
when
the
arrival
of
demosthenes
completely
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
and
restored
the
superiority
to
the
invaders
with
in
the
highest
state
of
efficiency
and
brilliantly
equipped
with
a
force
of
five
thousand
picked
men
of
the
regular
infantry
of
athens
and
her
allies
and
a
still
larger
number
of
bowmen
and
slingers
on
board
demosthenes
rowed
round
the
great
harbour
with
loud
cheers
and
martial
music
as
if
in
defiance
of
the
syracusans
and
their
confederates
his
arrival
had
indeed
changed
their
hopes
into
the
deepest
consternation
the
resources
of
athens
seemed
inexhaustible
and
resistance
to
her
hopeless
they
had
been
told
that
she
was
reduced
to
the
last
extremities
and
that
her
territory
was
occupied
by
an
enemy
and
yet
here
they
saw
her
as
if
in
prodigality
of
power
sending
forth
to
make
foreign
conquests
a
second
armament
not
inferior
to
that
with
which
nicias
had
first
landed
on
the
sicilian
shores
with
the
intuitive
decision
of
a
great
commander
demosthenes
at
once
saw
that
the
possession
of
epipolae
was
the
key
to
the
possession
of
syracuse
and
he
resolved
to
make
a
prompt
and
vigorous
attempt
to
recover
that
position
while
his
force
was
unimpaired
and
the
consternation
which
its
arrival
had
produced
among
the
besieged
remained
unabated
the
syracusans
and
their
allies
had
run
out
an
outwork
along
epipolae
from
the
city
walls
intersecting
the
fortified
lines
of
circumvallation
which
nicias
had
commenced
but
from
which
they
had
been
driven
by
gylippus
could
demosthenes
succeed
in
storming
this
outwork
and
in
the
athenian
troops
on
the
high
ground
he
might
fairly
hope
to
be
able
to
resume
the
circumvallation
of
the
city
and
become
the
conqueror
of
syracuse
for
when
once
the
besiegers
lines
were
completed
the
number
of
the
troops
with
which
gylippus
had
garrisoned
the
place
would
only
tend
to
exhaust
the
stores
of
provisions
and
accelerate
its
downfall
an
attack
was
first
made
on
the
outwork
in
the
probably
more
with
the
view
of
blinding
the
besieged
to
the
nature
of
the
main
operations
than
with
any
expectation
of
succeeding
in
an
open
assault
with
every
disadvantage
of
the
ground
to
contend
against
but
when
the
darkness
had
set
in
demosthenes
formed
his
men
in
columns
each
soldier
taking
with
him
five
days
provisions
and
the
engineers
and
workmen
of
the
camp
following
the
troops
with
their
tools
and
all
portable
implements
of
fortification
so
as
at
once
to
secure
any
advantage
of
ground
that
the
army
might
gain
thus
equipped
and
prepared
he
led
his
men
along
by
the
foot
of
the
southern
flank
of
epipolae
in
a
direction
towards
the
interior
of
the
island
till
he
came
immediately
below
the
narrow
ridge
that
forms
the
extremity
of
the
high
ground
looking
westward
he
then
wheeled
his
vanguard
to
the
right
sent
them
rapidly
up
the
paths
that
wind
along
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
succeeded
in
completely
surprising
the
syracusan
outposts
and
in
placing
his
troops
fairly
on
the
extreme
summit
of
the
epipolae
thence
the
athenians
marched
eagerly
down
the
slope
towards
the
town
routing
some
syracusan
detachments
that
were
quartered
in
their
way
and
vigorously
assailing
the
unprotected
part
of
the
outwork
all
at
first
favoured
them
the
outwork
was
abandoned
by
its
garrison
and
the
athenian
engineers
began
to
dismantle
it
in
vain
gylippus
brought
up
fresh
troops
to
check
the
assault
the
athenians
broke
and
drove
them
back
and
continued
to
press
hotly
forward
in
the
full
confidence
of
victory
but
amid
the
general
consternation
of
the
syracusans
and
their
confederates
one
body
of
infantry
stood
firm
this
was
a
brigade
of
their
boeotian
allies
which
was
posted
low
down
the
slope
of
epipolae
outside
the
city
walls
coolly
and
steadily
the
boeotian
infantry
formed
their
line
and
undismayed
by
the
current
of
flight
around
them
advanced
against
the
advancing
athenians
this
was
the
crisis
of
the
battle
but
the
athenian
van
was
disorganized
by
its
own
previous
successes
and
yielding
to
the
unexpected
charge
thus
made
on
it
by
troops
in
perfect
order
and
of
the
most
obstinate
courage
it
was
driven
back
in
confusion
upon
the
other
divisions
of
the
army
that
still
continued
to
press
forward
when
once
the
tide
was
thus
turned
the
syracusans
passed
rapidly
from
the
extreme
of
panic
to
the
extreme
of
vengeful
daring
and
with
all
their
forces
they
now
fiercely
assailed
the
embarrassed
and
receding
athenians
in
vain
did
the
officers
of
the
latter
strive
to
their
line
amid
the
din
and
the
shouting
of
the
fight
and
the
confusion
inseparable
upon
a
night
engagement
especially
one
where
many
thousand
combatants
were
pent
and
whirled
together
in
a
narrow
and
uneven
area
the
necessary
manoeuvres
were
impracticable

as
that

her

or

but
far
unlike
the
transient
whirlwinds
of

the
advance
of
the

leader
was
no
less
deliberate
than
rapid
at
every
step
the
greek
power
took
root
and
the
language
and
the

of

were
planted
from
the
shores
of

from

and

for

a
thousand
years
and
in
their
effects
to
endure
for

a
long
and
not
uninstructive
list
might
be
made
out
of
illustrious
men
whose
characters
have
been
vindicated
during
recent
times
from
aspersions
which
for
centuries
had
been
thrown
on
them
the
spirit
of
modern
inquiry
and
the
tendency
of
modern
scholarship
both
of
which
are
often
said
to
be
solely
negative
and
destructive
have
in
truth
restored
to
splendour
and
almost
created
anew
far
more
than
they
have
assailed
with
censure
or
dismissed
from
consideration
as
unreal
the
truth
of
many
a
brilliant
narrative
of
brilliant
exploits
has
of
late
years
been
triumphantly
demonstrated
and
the
shallowness
of
the
sceptical
scoffs
with
which
little
minds
have
carped
at
the
great
minds
of
antiquity
has
been
in
many
instances
decisively
exposed
the
laws
the
politics
and
the
lines
of
action
adopted
or
recommended
by
eminent
men
and
powerful
nations
have
been
examined
with
keener
investigation
and
considered
with
more
comprehensive
judgment
than
formerly
were
brought
to
bear
on
these
subjects
the
result
has
been
at
least
as
often
favourable
as
unfavourable
to
the
persons
and
the
states
so
scrutinized
and
many
an
slander
against
both
measures
and
men
has
thus
been
silenced
we
may
hope
for
ever
the
veracity
of
herodotus
the
pure
patriotism
of
pericles
of
demosthenes
and
of
the
gracchi
the
wisdom
of
cleisthenes
and
of
licinius
as
constitutional
reformers
may
be
mentioned
as
facts
which
recent
writers
have
cleared
from
unjust
suspicion
and
censure
and
it
might
be
easily
shown
that
the
defensive
tendency
which
distinguishes
the
present
and
recent
best
historians
of
germany
france
and
england
has
been
equally
manifested
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
have
treated
the
heroes
of
thought
and
the
heroes
of
action
who
lived
during
what
we
term
the
middle
ages
and
whom
it
was
so
long
the
fashion
to
sneer
at
or
neglect
the
name
of
the
victor
of
arbela
has
led
to
these
reflections
for
although
the
rapidity
and
extent
of
alexander
conquests
have
through
all
ages
challenged
admiration
and
amazement
the
grandeur
of
genius
which
he
displayed
in
his
schemes
of
commerce
civilization
and
of
comprehensive
union
and
unity
amongst
nations
has
until
lately
been
comparatively
unhonoured
this
depreciation
was
of
early
date
the
ancient
rhetoricians
a
class
of
babblers
a
school
for
lies
and
scandal
as
niebuhr
justly
termed
them
chose
among
the
stock
themes
for
their
commonplaces
the
character
and
exploits
of
alexander
they
had
their
followers
in
every
age
and
until
a
very
recent
period
all
who
wished
to
point
a
moral
or
adorn
a
tale
about
unreasoning
ambition
extravagant
pride
and
the
formidable
frenzies
of
free
will
when
leagued
with
free
power
have
never
failed
to
blazon
forth
the
madman
of
macedonia
as
one
of
the
most
glaring
examples
without
doubt
many
of
these
writers
adopted
with
implicit
credence
traditional
ideas
and
supposed
with
uninquiring
philanthropy
that
in
blackening
alexander
they
were
doing
humanity
good
service
but
also
without
doubt
many
of
his
assailants
like
those
of
other
great
men
have
been
mainly
instigated
by
that
strongest
of
all
antipathies
the
antipathy
of
a
mind
to
a
one
de
stael
and
by
the
envy
which
talent
too
often
bears
to
genius
arrian
who
wrote
his
history
of
alexander
when
hadrian
was
emperor
of
the
roman
world
and
when
the
spirit
of
declamation
and
dogmatism
was
at
its
full
height
but
who
was
himself
unlike
the
dreaming
pedants
of
the
schools
a
statesman
and
a
soldier
of
practical
and
proved
ability
well
rebuked
the
malevolent
aspersions
which
he
heard
continually
thrown
upon
the
memory
of
the
great
conqueror
of
the
east
he
truly
says
let
the
man
who
speaks
evil
of
alexander
not
merely
bring
forward
those
passages
of
alexander
life
which
were
really
evil
but
let
him
collect
and
review
all
the
actions
of
alexander
and
then
let
him
thoroughly
consider
first
who
and
what
manner
of
man
he
himself
is
and
what
has
been
his
own
career
and
then
let
him
consider
who
and
what
manner
of
man
alexander
was
and
to
what
an
eminence
of
human
grandeur
he
arrived
let
him
consider
that
alexander
was
a
king
and
the
undisputed
lord
of
the
two
continents
and
that
his
name
is
renowned
throughout
the
whole
earth
let
the
against
alexander
bear
all
this
in
mind
and
then
let
him
reflect
on
his
own
insignificance
the
pettiness
of
his
own
circumstances
and
affairs
and
the
blunders
that
he
makes
about
these
paltry
and
trifling
as
they
are
let
him
then
ask
himself
whether
he
is
a
fit
person
to
censure
and
revile
such
a
man
as
alexander
i
believe
that
there
was
in
his
time
no
nation
of
men
no
city
nay
no
single
individual
with
whom
alexander
name
had
not
become
a
familiar
word
i
therefore
hold
that
such
a
man
who
was
like
no
ordinary
mortal
was
not
born
into
the
world
without
some
special
providence

his
sense
of
the
grandeur
of
the

played
in
the

by
the

that

fearful
passions
of

followers
into

the

of
his
enemies
into
cowardice
such
spirits
have
been
stirred
up
in
sundry
ages
of
the

in
divers
parts
thereof
to
erect

cast

to
the

certain
ends
which
the
infinite
spirit
of
the
universal
piercing
moving

all
things
hath
ordained
certainly
the
things
that
this

did
were
marvellous
and
would
hardly
have
been
undertaken
by
any

else

though
his

how

the

of

on

of

conqueror
of

is
no
less
graphic
than
true
alexander
crossed
the
dardanelles
with
an
army
of
about
forty
thousand
men
of
which
was

he
forced
the
passage
of

greek
who

he
spent
the
whole
of

power

was
seconded

to
their
own
particular
laws
their
empire
was
a
union
of
confederated
states
and
did
not
form
one
nation
this
facilitated
its
conquest
as
alexander
only
wished
for
the
throne
of
the
monarch
he
easily
effected
the
change
by
respecting
the
customs

of

the

to
be
estimated
not
by
the

and
with

such
was
the
ascendancy
of

so
wonderfully
comprehensive
and
assimilating
was
the

it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
this

complete
as
to
exterminate

value

have
been
gratefully
recognised
by
those
who
have
observed
how
the

were
aided
by
that
diffusion
of

important

produced
on
the

of
the
inhabitants
of

of
the

ones
by
the
animating
contact

spirit
much
of

much
of
the
literature
of
the
later
persian
kingdom
of
the
arsacidae
either
originated
from
or
was
largely
modified
by
grecian
influences
so
also
the
learning
and
science
of
the
arabians
were
in
a
far
less
degree
the
result
of
original
invention
and
genius
than
the
reproduction
in
an
altered
form
of
the
greek
philosophy
and
the
greek
lore
acquired
by
the
saracenic
conquerors
together
with
their
acquisition
of

had

a
thousand
years
before
the
armed
disciples
of
mahomet
commenced
their
career
in
the
east
it
is
well
known
that
western
europe
in
the
middle
ages
drew
its
philosophy
its
arts
and
its
science
principally
from
arabian
teachers
and
thus
we
see
how
the
intellectual
influence
of
ancient
greece
poured
on
the
eastern
world
by
alexander
victories
and
then
brought
back
to
bear
on
mediaeval
europe
by
the
spread
of
the
saracenic
powers

exerted
its
action
on
the
elements
of
modern
civilization
by
this

indirect

as
by
the
more
obvious

these
considerations
invest
the
macedonian
triumphs
in
the
east
with
interest
such
as
the
most
showy
and
sanguinary
successes
of
mere
low
ambition
and
the
pride
of
kings
however
they
may
dazzle
for
a
moment
can
never
retain
with
posterity
whether
the
old
persian
empire
which
cyrus
founded
could
have
survived
much
longer
than
it
did
even
if
darius
had
been
victorious
at
arbela
may
safely
be
disputed
that
ancient
dominion
like
the
turkish
at
the
present
time
laboured
under
every
cause
of
decay
and
dissolution
the
satraps
like
the
modern
pachas
continually
rebelled
against
the
central
power
and
egypt
in
particular
was
almost
always
in
a
state
of
insurrection
against
its
nominal
sovereign
there
was
no
longer
any
effective
central
control
or
any
internal
principle
of
unity
fused
through
the
huge
mass
of
the
empire
and

persia
was
evidently
about
to
fall
but
had
it
not
been
for
alexander
invasion
of
asia
she
would
most
probably
have
fallen
beneath
some
other
oriental
power
as
media
and
babylon
had
formerly
fallen
before
herself
and
as
in
after
times
the
parthian
supremacy
gave
way
to
the
revived
ascendancy
of
persia
in
the
east
under
the
sceptres
of
the
arsacidae
a
revolution
that
merely
substituted
one
eastern
power
for
another
would
have
been
utterly
barren
and
unprofitable
to
mankind
alexander
victory
at
arbela
not
only
overthrew
an
oriental
dynasty
but
established
european
rulers
in
its
stead
it
broke
the
monotony
of
the

by
the

arbela
the
city
which
has
furnished
its
name
to
the
decisive
battle
that
gave
asia
to
alexander
lies
more
than
twenty
miles
from
the
actual
scene
of
conflict
the
little
village
then
named
gaugamela
is
close
to
the
spot
where
the
armies
met
but
has
ceded
the
honour
of
naming
the
battle
to
its
more
euphonious
neighbour
gaugamela
is
situate
in
one
of
the
wide
plains
that
lie
between
the
tigris
and
the
mountains
of
kurdistan
a
few
undulating
hillocks
diversify
the
surface
of
this
sandy
track
but
the
ground
is
generally
level
and
admirably
qualified
for
the
evolutions
of
cavalry
and
also
calculated
to
give
the
larger
of
two
armies
the
full
advantage
of
numerical
superiority
the
persian
king
who
before
he
came
to
the
throne
had
proved
his
personal
valour
as
a
soldier
and
his
skill
as
a
general
had
wisely
selected
this
region
for
the
third
and
decisive
encounter
between
his
forces
and
the
invaders
the
previous
defeats
of
his
troops
however
severe
they
had
been
were
not
looked
on
as
irreparable
the
granicus
had
been
fought
by
his
generals
rashly
and
without
mutual
concert
and
though
darius
himself
had
commanded
and
been
beaten
at
issus
that
defeat
might
be
attributed
to
the
disadvantageous
nature
of
the
ground
where
cooped
up
between
the
mountains
the
river
and
the
sea
the
numbers
of
the
persians
confused
and
clogged
alike
the
general
skill
and
the
prowess
so
that
their
very
strength
became
their
weakness
here
on
the
broad
plains
of
kurdistan
there
was
scope
for
asia
largest
host
to
array
its
lines
to
wheel
to
skirmish
to
condense
or
expand
its
squadrons
to
manoeuvre
and
to
charge
at
will
should
alexander
and
his
scanty
band
dare
to
plunge
into
that
living
sea
of
war
their
destruction
seemed
inevitable
darius
felt
however
the
critical
nature
to
himself
as
well
as
to
his
adversary
of
the
coming
encounter
he
could
not
hope
to
retrieve
the
consequences
of
a
third
overthrow
the
great
cities
of
mesopotamia
and
upper
asia
the
central
provinces
of
the
persian
empire
were
certain
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
victor
darius
knew
also
the
asiatic
character
well
enough
to
be
aware
how
it
yields
to
the
prestige
of
success
and
the
apparent
career
of
destiny
he
felt
that
the
diadem
was
now
either
to
be
firmly
replaced
on
his
own
brow
or
to
be
irrevocably
transferred
to
the
head
of
his
european
conqueror
he
therefore
during
the
long
interval
left
him
after
the
battle
of
issus
while
alexander
was
subjugating
syria
and
egypt
assiduously
busied
himself
in
selecting
the
best
troops
which
his
vast
empire
supplied
and
in
training
his
varied
forces
to
act
together
with
some
uniformity
of
discipline
and
system
the
hardy
mountaineers
of
affghanistan
bokhara
khiva
and
thibet
were
then
as
at
present
far
different
from
the
generality
of
asiatics
in
warlike
spirit
and
endurance
from
these
districts
darius
collected
large
bodies
of
admirable
infantry
and
the
countries
of
the
modern
kurds
and
turkomans
supplied
as
they
do
now
squadrons
of
horsemen
strong
skilful
bold
and
trained
to
a
life
of
constant
activity
and
warfare
it
is
not
uninteresting
to
notice
that
the
ancestors
of
our
own
late
enemies
the
sikhs
served
as
allies
of
darius
against
the
macedonians
they
are
spoken
of
in
arrian
as
indians
who
dwelt
near
bactria
they
were
attached
to
the
troops
of
that
satrapy
and
their
cavalry
was
one
of
the
most
formidable
forces
in
the
whole
persian
army
besides
these
picked
troops
contingents
also
came
in
from
the
numerous
other
provinces
that
yet
obeyed
the
great
king
altogether
the
horse
are
said
to
have
been
forty
thousand
the
chariots
two
hundred
and
the
armed
elephants
fifteen
in
number
the
amount
of
the
infantry
is
uncertain
but
the
knowledge
which
both
ancient
and
modern
times
supply
of
the
usual
character
of
oriental
armies
and
of
their
populations
of
may
warrant
us
in
believing
that
many
myriads
were
prepared
to
fight
or
to
encumber
those
who
fought
for
the
last
darius
the
position
of
the
persian
king
near
mesopotamia
was
chosen
with
great
military
skill
it
was
certain
that
alexander
on
his
return
from
egypt
must
march
northward
along
the
syrian
coast
before
he
attacked
the
central
provinces
of
the
persian
empire
a
direct
eastward
march
from
the
lower
part
of
palestine
across
the
great
syrian
desert
was
then
as
now
utterly
impracticable
marching
eastward
from
syria
alexander
would
on
crossing
the
euphrates
arrive
at
the
vast
mesopotamian
plains
the
wealthy
capitals
of
the
empire
babylon
susa
and
persepolis
would
then
lie
to
his
south
and
if
he
marched
down
through
mesopotamia
to
attack
them
darius
might
reasonably
hope
to
follow
the
macedonians
with
his
immense
force
of
cavalry
and
without
even
risking
a
pitched
battle
to
harass
and
finally
overwhelm
them
we
may
remember
that
three
centuries
afterwards
a
roman
army
under
crassus
was
thus
actually
destroyed
by
the
oriental
archers
and
horsemen
in
these
very
plains
see
mitford
and
that
the
ancestors
of
the
parthians
who
thus
vanquished
the
roman
legions
served
by
thousands
under
king
darius
if
on
the
contrary
alexander
should
defer
his
march
against
babylon
and
first
seek
an
encounter
with
the
persian
army
the
country
on
each
side
of
the
tigris
in
this
latitude
was
highly
advantageous
for
such
an
army
as
darius
commanded
and
he
had
close
in
his
rear
the
mountainous
districts
of
northern
media
where
he
himself
had
in
early
life
been
satrap
where
he
had
acquired
reputation
as
a
soldier
and
a
general
and
where
he
justly
expected
to
find
loyalty
to
his
person
and
a
safe
refuge
in
case
of
defeat
mitford
remarks
on
the
strategy
of
darius
in
his
last
campaign
are
very
just
after
having
been
unduly
admired
as
an
historian
mitford
is
now
unduly
neglected
his
partiality
and
his
deficiency
in
scholarship
have
been
exposed
sufficiently
to
make
him
no
longer
a
dangerous
guide
as
to
greek
polities
while
the
clearness
and
brilliancy
of
his
narrative
and
the
strong
common
sense
of
his
remarks
where
his
party
prejudices
do
not
interfere
must
always
make
his
volumes
valuable
as
well
as
entertaining
his
great
antagonist
came
on
across
the
euphrates
against
him
at
the
head
of
an
army
which
arrian
copying
from
the
journals
of
macedonian
officers
states
to
have
consisted
of
forty
thousand
foot
and
seven
thousand
horse
in
studying
the
campaigns
of
alexander
we
possess
the
peculiar
advantage
of
deriving
our
information
from
two
of
generals
of
division
who
bore
an
important
part
in
all
his
enterprises
aristobulus
and
ptolemy
who
afterwards
became
king
of
egypt
kept
regular
journals
of
the
military
events
which
they
witnessed
and
these
journals
were
in
the
possession
of
arrian
when
he
drew
up
his
history
of
alexander
expedition
the
high
character
of
arrian
for
integrity
makes
us
confident
that
he
used
them
fairly
and
his
comments
on
the
occasional
discrepancies
between
the
two
macedonian
narratives
prove
that
he
used
them
sensibly
he
frequently
quotes
the
very
words
of
his
authorities
and
his
history
thus
acquires
a
charm
such
as
very
few
ancient
or
modern
military
narratives
possess
the
anecdotes
and
expressions
which
he
records
we
fairly
believe
to
be
genuine
and
not
to
be
the
coinage
of
a
rhetorician
like
those
in
curtius
in
fact
in
reading
arrian
we
read
general
aristobulus
and
general
ptolemy
on
the
campaigns
of
the
macedonians
and
it
is
like
reading
general
jomini
or
general
foy
on
the
campaigns
of
the
french
the
estimate
which
we
find
in
arrian
of
the
strength
of
army
seems
reasonable
when
we
take
into
account
both
the
losses
which
he
had
sustained
and
the
reinforcements
which
he
had
received
since
he
left
europe
indeed
to
englishmen
who
know
with
what
mere
handfuls
of
men
our
own
generals
have
at
plassy
at
assaye
at
meeanee
and
other
indian
battles
routed
large
hosts
of
asiatics
the
disparity
of
numbers
that
we
read
of
in
the
victories
won
by
the
macedonians
over
the
persians
presents
nothing
incredible
the
army
which
alexander
now
led
was
wholly
composed
of
veteran
troops
in
the
highest
possible
state
of
equipment
and
discipline
enthusiastically
devoted
to
their
leader
and
full
of
confidence
in
his
military
genius
and
his
victorious
destiny
the
celebrated
macedonian
phalanx
formed
the
main
strength
of
his
infantry
this
force
had
been
raised
and
organized
by
his
father
philip
who
on
his
accession
to
the
macedonian
throne
needed
a
numerous
and
army
and
who
by
lengthening
the
spear
of
the
ordinary
greek
phalanx
and
increasing
the
depth
of
the
files
brought
the
tactic
of
armed
masses
to
the
greatest
efficiency
of
which
it
was
capable
with
such
materials
as
he
possessed
see
niebuhr
hist
of
rome
iii
he
formed
his
men
sixteen
deep
and
placed
in
their
grasp
the
sarissa
as
the
macedonian
pike
was
called
which
was
feet
in
length
and
when
couched
for
action
reached
eighteen
feet
in
front
of
the
soldier
so
that
as
a
space
of
about
two
feet
was
allowed
between
the
ranks
the
spears
of
the
five
files
behind
him
projected
in
advance
of
each
man
the
phalangite
soldier
was
fully
equipped
in
the
defensive
armour
of
the
regular
greek
infantry
and
thus
the
phalanx
presented
a
ponderous
and
bristling
mass
which
as
long
as
its
order
was
kept
compact
was
sure
to
bear
down
all
opposition
the
defects
of
such
an
organization
are
obvious
and
were
proved
in
after
years
when
the
macedonians
were
opposed
to
the
roman
legions
but
it
is
clear
that
under
alexander
the
phalanx
was
not
the
cumbrous
unwieldy
body
which
it
was
at
cynoscephalae
and
pydna
his
men
were
veterans
and
he
could
obtain
from
them
an
accuracy
of
movement
and
steadiness
of
evolution
such
as
probably
the
recruits
of
his
father
would
only
have
floundered
in
attempting
and
such
as
certainly
were
impracticable
in
the
phalanx
when
handled
by
his
successors
especially
as
under
them
it
ceased
to
be
a
standing
force
and
became
only
a
militia
see
niebuhr
under
alexander
the
phalanx
consisted
of
an
aggregate
of
eighteen
thousand
men
who
were
divided
into
six
brigades
of
three
thousand
each
these
were
again
subdivided
into
regiments
and
companies
and
the
men
were
carefully
trained
to
wheel
to
face
about
to
take
more
ground
or
to
close
up
as
the
emergencies
of
the
battle
required
alexander
also
arrayed
in
the
intervals
of
the
regiments
of
his
phalangites
troops
armed
in
a
different
manner
which
could
prevent
their
line
from
being
pierced
and
their
companies
taken
in
flank
when
the
nature
of
the
ground
prevented
a
close
formation
and
which
could
be
withdrawn
when
a
favourable
opportunity
arrived
for
closing
up
the
phalanx
or
any
of
its
brigades
for
a
charge
or
when
it
was
necessary
to
prepare
to
receive
cavalry
besides
the
phalanx
alexander
had
a
considerable
force
of
infantry
who
were
called
they
were
not
so
heavily
armed
as
the
phalangites
or
as
was
the
case
with
the
greek
regular
infantry
in
general
but
they
were
equipped
for
close
fight
as
well
as
for
skirmishing
and
were
far
superior
to
the
ordinary
irregular
troops
of
greek
warfare
they
were
about
six
thousand
strong
besides
these
he
had
several
bodies
of
greek
regular
infantry
and
he
had
archers
slingers
and
who
fought
also
with
broadsword
and
target
these
were
principally
supplied
to
him
by
the
highlanders
of
illyria
and
thracia
the
main
strength
of
his
cavalry
consisted
in
two
chosen
corps
of
cuirassiers
one
macedonian
and
one
thessalian
each
of
which
was
about
fifteen
hundred
strong
they
were
provided
with
long
lances
and
heavy
swords
and
horse
as
well
as
man
was
fully
equipped
with
defensive
armour
other
regiments
of
regular
cavalry
were
less
heavily
armed
and
there
were
several
bodies
of
light
horsemen
whom
alexander
conquests
in
egypt
and
syria
had
enabled
him
to
mount
superbly
a
little
before
the
end
of
august
alexander
crossed
the
euphrates
at
thapsacus
a
small
corps
of
persian
cavalry
under
mazaeus
retiring
before
him
alexander
was
too
prudent
to
march
down
through
the
mesopotamian
deserts
and
continued
to
advance
eastward
with
the
intention
of
passing
the
tigris
and
then
if
he
was
unable
to
find
darius
and
bring
him
to
action
of
marching
southward
on
the
left
side
of
that
river
along
the
skirts
of
a
mountainous
district
where
his
men
would
suffer
less
from
heat
and
thirst
and
where
provisions
would
be
more
abundant
darius
finding
that
his
adversary
was
not
to
be
enticed
into
the
march
through
mesopotamia
against
his
capital
determined
to
remain
on
the
which
he
had
chosen
on
the
left
of
the
tigris
where
if
his
enemy
met
a
defeat
or
a
check
the
destruction
of
the
invaders
would
be
certain
with
two
such
rivers
as
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
in
their
rear
the
persian
king
availed
himself
to
the
utmost
of
every
advantage
in
his
power
he
caused
a
large
space
of
ground
to
be
carefully
levelled
for
the
operation
of
his
chariots
and
he
deposited
his
military
stores
in
the
strong
town
of
arbela
about
twenty
miles
in
his
rear
the
rhetoricians
of
after
ages
have
loved
to
describe
darius
codomannus
as
a
second
xerxes
in
ostentation
and
imbecility
but
a
fair
examination
of
his
generalship
in
this
his
last
campaign
shows
that
he
was
worthy
of
bearing
the
same
name
as
his
great
predecessor
the
royal
son
of
hystaspes
on
learning
that
darius
was
with
a
large
army
on
the
left
of
the
tigris
alexander
hurried
forward
and
crossed
that
river
without
opposition
he
was
at
first
unable
to
procure
any
certain
intelligence
of
the
precise
position
of
the
enemy
and
after
giving
his
army
a
short
interval
of
rest
he
marched
for
four
days
down
the
left
bank
of
the
river
a
moralist
may
pause
upon
the
fact
that
alexander
must
in
this
march
have
passed
within
a
few
miles
of
the
remains
of
nineveh
the
great
city
of
the
primaeval
conquerors
of
the
human
race
neither
the
macedonian
king
nor
any
of
his
followers
knew
what
those
vast
mounds
had
once
been
they
had
already
become
nameless
masses
of
ruins
and
it
is
only
within
the
last
few
years
that
the
intellectual
energy
of
one
of
our
own
countrymen
has
rescued
nineveh
from
its
long
centuries
of
oblivion
see
layard
nineveh
and
also
vaux
nineveh
and
persepolis
p
on
the
fourth
day
of
alexander
southward
march
his
advanced
guard
reported
that
a
body
of
the
enemy
cavalry
was
in
sight
he
instantly
formed
his
army
in
order
for
battle
and
directing
them
to
advance
steadily
he
rode
forward
at
the
head
of
some
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
charged
the
persian
horse
whom
he
found
before
him
this
was
a
mere
reconnoitring
party
and
they
broke
and
fled
immediately
but
the
macedonians
made
some
prisoners
and
from
them
alexander
found
that
darius
was
posted
only
a
few
miles
off
and
learned
the
strength
of
the
army
that
he
had
with
him
on
receiving
this
news
alexander
halted
and
gave
his
men
repose
for
four
days
so
that
they
should
go
into
action
fresh
and
vigorous
he
also
fortified
his
camp
and
deposited
in
it
all
his
military
stores
and
all
his
sick
and
disabled
soldiers
intending
to
advance
upon
the
enemy
with
the
serviceable
part
of
his
army
perfectly
unencumbered
after
this
halt
he
moved
forward
while
it
was
yet
dark
with
the
intention
of
reaching
the
enemy
and
attacking
them
at
break
of
day
about
between
the
camps
there
were
some
undulations
of
the
ground
which
concealed
the
two
armies
from
each
other
view
but
on
alexander
arriving
at
their
summit
he
saw
by
the
early
light
the
persian
host
arrayed
before
him
and
he
probably
also
observed
traces
of
some
engineering
operation
having
been
carried
on
along
part
of
the
ground
in
front
of
them
not
knowing
that
these
marks
had
been
caused
by
the
persians
having
levelled
the
ground
for
the
free
use
of
their
alexander
suspected
that
hidden
pitfalls
had
been
prepared
with
a
view
of
disordering
the
approach
of
his
cavalry
he
summoned
a
council
of
war
forthwith
some
of
the
officers
were
for
attacking
instantly
at
all
hazards
but
the
more
prudent
opinion
of
parmenio
prevailed
and
it
was
determined
not
to
advance
farther
till
the
had
been
carefully
surveyed
alexander
halted
his
army
on
the
heights
and
taking
with
him
some
infantry
and
some
cavalry
he
passed
part
of
the
day
in
reconnoitring
the
enemy
and
observing
the
nature
of
the
ground
which
he
had
to
fight
on
darius
wisely
refrained
from
moving
from
his
position
to
attack
the
macedonians
on
eminences
which
they
occupied
and
the
two
armies
remained
until
night
without
molesting
each
other
on
return
to
his
he
summoned
his
generals
and
superior
officers
together
and
telling
them
that
he
well
knew
that
their
zeal
wanted
no
exhortation
he
besought
them
to
do
their
utmost
in
encouraging
and
instructing
those
whom
each
commanded
to
do
their
best
in
the
next
day
battle
they
were
to
remind
them
that
they
were
now
not
going
to
fight
for
a
province
as
they
had
hitherto
fought
but
they
were
about
to
decide
by
their
swords
the
dominion
of
all
asia
each
officer
ought
to
impress
this
upon
his
subalterns
and
they
should
urge
it
on
their
men
their
natural
courage
required
no
long
words
to
excite
its
ardour
but
they
should
be
reminded
of
the
paramount
importance
of
steadiness
in
action
the
silence
in
the
ranks
must
be
unbroken
as
long
as
silence
was
proper
but
when
the
time
came
for
the
charge
the
shout
and
the
cheer
must
be
full
of
terror
for
the
foe
the
officers
were
to
be
alert
in
receiving
and
communicating
orders
and
every
one
was
to
act
as
if
he
felt
that
the
whole
result
of
the
battle
depended
on
his
own
single
good
conduct
having
thus
briefly
instructed
his
generals
alexander
ordered
that
the
army
should
sup
and
take
their
rest
for
the
night
darkness
had
closed
over
the
tents
of
the
macedonians
when
veteran
general
parmenio
came
to
him
and
proposed
that
they
should
make
a
night
attack
on
the
persians
the
king
is
said
to
have
answered
that
he
scorned
to
such
a
victory
and
that
alexander
must
conquer
openly
and
fairly
arrian
justly
remarks
that
alexander
resolution
was
as
wise
as
it
was
spirited
besides
the
confusion
and
uncertainty
which
are
inseparable
from
night
engagements
the
value
of
alexander
victory
would
have
been
impaired
if
gained
under
circumstances
which
might
supply
the
enemy
with
any
excuse
for
his
defeat
and
encourage
him
to
renew
the
contest
it
was
necessary
for
alexander
not
only
to
beat
darius
but
to
gain
such
a
victory
as
should
leave
his
rival
without
apology
for
defeat
and
without
hope
of
recovery
the
persians
in
fact
expected
and
were
prepared
to
meet
a
night
attack
such
was
the
apprehension
that
darius
entertained
of
it
that
he
formed
his
troops
at
evening
in
order
of
battle
and
kept
them
under
arms
all
night
the
effect
of
this
was
that
the
morning
found
them
jaded
and
dispirited
while
it
brought
their
adversaries
all
fresh
and
vigorous
against
them
the
written
order
of
battle
which
darius
himself
caused
to
be
drawn
up
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
macedonians
after
the
engagement
and
aristobulus
copied
it
into
his
journal
we
thus
possess
through
arrian
unusually
authentic
information
as
to
the
composition
and
arrangement
of
the
persian
army
on
the
extreme
left
were
the
bactrian
daan
and
arachosian
cavalry
next
to
these
darius
placed
the
troops
from

horse
and

then
came
the
susians
and
next
to
these
the
cadusians
these
forces
made
up
the
left
wing
darius
own
station
was
in
the
centre
this
was
composed
of
the
indians
the
carians
the
mardian
archers
and
the
division
of
persians
who
were
distinguished
by
the
golden
apples
that
formed
knobs
of
their
spears
here
also
were
stationed
the
of
the
persian
nobility
besides
these
there
were
in
the
centre
formed
in
deep
order
the
uxian
and
babylonian
troops
and
the
soldiers
from
the

sea
the
brigade
of
greek
mercenaries
whom
darius
had
in
his
service
and
who
were
alone

fit
to
stand
in

charge
of
the
macedonian
phalanx

the
tapurians
hyrcanians
albanians

with
a

of

bactrian
horse
and
a
hundred

the
elephants
and
fifty
chariots
were
ranged
in

centre
and
fifty
more
chariots
with
the
armenian
and
cappadocian
cavalry
were
drawn
up
in

of
the
right

thus
arrayed
the
great
host
of
king
darius
passed
the
night
that
to
many
thousands
of
them
was
the
last
of
their
existence
the
morning
of
the
first
of
october
two
thousand
one
hundred
and
years
ago
dawned
slowly
to
their
wearied
watching
and
they
could
hear
the
note
of
the
macedonian
trumpet
sounding
to
arms
and
could
see
king
forces
descend
from
their
tents
on
the
heights
and
form
in
order
of
battle
on
the
plain
see
clinton
fasti
hellenici
the
battle
was
fought
eleven
days
after
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
which
gives
the
means
of
fixing
the
precise
date
there
was
deep
need
of
skill
as
well
as
of
valour
on
alexander
side
and
few
have
witnessed
more
consummate
generalship
than
was
now
displayed
by
the
macedonian
king
there
were
no
natural
barriers
by
which
he
could
protect
his
flanks
and
not
only
was
he
certain
to
be
overlapped
on
either
wing
by
the
vast
lines
of
the
persian
army
but
there
was
imminent
risk
of
their
circling
round
him
and
charging
him
in
the
rear
while
he
advanced
against
their
centre
he
formed
therefore
a
second
or
reserve
line
which
was
to
wheel
round
if
required
or
to
detach
troops
to
either
flank
as
the
enemy
movements
might
necessitate
and
thus
with
their
whole
army
ready
at
any
moment
to
be
thrown
into
one
vast
hollow
square
the
macedonians
advanced
in
two
lines
against
the
enemy
alexander
himself
leading
on
the
right
wing
and
the
renowned
phalanx
forming
the
centre
while
parmenio
commanded
on
the
left
such
was
the
general
nature
of
the
disposition
which
alexander
made
of
his
army
but
we
have
in
arrian
the
details
of
the
position
of
each
brigade
and
regiment
and
as
we
know
that
these
details
were
taken
from
the
journals
of
macedonian
generals
it
is
interesting
to
examine
them
and
to
read
the
names
and
stations
of

alexander
took
his
own
station
as
his
custom
was
in
the
right
wing
at
the
head
of
his
cavalry
and
when
all
the
arrangements
for
the
battle
were
complete
and
his
generals
were
fully
instructed
how
to
act
in
each
probable
emergency
he
began
to
lead
his
men
towards
the
enemy
it
was
ever
his
custom
to
expose
his
life
freely
in
battle
and
to
emulate
the
personal
prowess
of
his
great
ancestor
achilles
perhaps
in
the
bold
enterprise
of
conquering
persia
it
was
politic
for
alexander
to
raise
his
army
daring
to
the
utmost
by
the
example
of
his
own
heroic
valour
and
in
his
subsequent
campaigns
the
love
of
the
excitement
of
the
rapture
of
the
strife
may
have
made
him
like
murat
continue
from
choice
a
custom
which
he
commenced
from
duty
but
he
never
suffered
the
ardour
of
the
soldier
to
make
him
lose
the
coolness
of
the
general
and
at
arbela
in
particular
he
showed
that
he
could
act
up
to
his
favourite
homeric
maxim
great
reliance
had
been
placed
by
the
persian
king
on
the
effects
of
the
chariots
it
was
designed
to
launch
these
against
the
macedonian
phalanx
and
to
follow
them
up
by
a
heavy
charge
of
cavalry
which
it
was
hoped
would
find
the
ranks
of
the
spearmen
disordered
by
the
rush
of
the
chariots
and
easily
destroy
this
most
formidable
part
of
alexander
force
in
front
therefore
of
the
persian
centre
where
darius
took
his
station
and
which
it
was
supposed
the
phalanx
would
attack
the
ground
had
been
carefully
levelled
and
smoothed
so
as
to
allow
the
chariots
to
charge
over
it
with
their
full
sweep
and
speed
as
the
macedonian
army
approached
the
persian
alexander
found
that
the
front
of
his
whole
line
barely
equalled
the
front
of
the
persian
centre
so
that
he
was
outflanked
on
his
right
by
the
entire
left
wing
of
the
enemy
and
by
their
entire
right
wing
on
his
left
his
tactics
were
to
assail
some
one
point
of
the
hostile
army
and
gain
a
decisive
advantage
while
he
refused
as
far
as
possible
the
encounter
along
the
rest
of
the
line
he
therefore
inclined
his
order
of
march
to
the
right
so
as
to
enable
his
right
wing
and
centre
to
come
into
collision
with
the
enemy
on
as
favourable
terms
as
possible
though
the
manoeuvre
might
in
some
respects
compromise
his
left
the
effect
of
this
oblique
movement
was
to
bring
the
phalanx
and
his
own
wing
nearly
beyond
the
limits
of
the
ground
which
the
persians
had
prepared
for
the
operations
of
the
chariots
and
darius
fearing
to
lose
the
benefit
of
this
arm
against
the
most
important
parts
of
the
macedonian
force
ordered
the
scythian
and
bactrian
cavalry
who
were
drawn
up
on
his
extreme
left
to
charge
round
upon
alexander
right
wing
and
check
its
further
lateral
progress
against
these
assailants
alexander
sent
from
his
second
line
menidas
cavalry
as
these
proved
too
few
to
make
head
against
the
enemy
he
ordered
ariston
also
from
the
second
line
with
his
light
horse
and
cleander
with
his
foot
in
support
of
menidas
the
bactrians
and
scythians
now
began
to
give
way
but
darius
reinforced
them
by
the
mass
of
bactrian
cavalry
from
his
main
line
and
an
obstinate
cavalry
fight
now
took
place
the
bactrians
and
scythians
were
numerous
and
were
better
armed
than
the
horseman
under
menidas
and
ariston
and
the
loss
at
first
was
heaviest
on
the
macedonian
side
but
still
the
european
cavalry
stood
the
charge
of
the
asiatics
and
at
last
by
their
superior
discipline
and
by
acting
in
squadrons
that
supported
each
other
instead
of
fighting
in
a
confused
mass
like
the
barbarians
the
macedonians
broke
their
adversaries
and
drove
them
off
the
field
the
best
explanation
of
this
may
be
found
in
napoleon
account
of
the
cavalry
fights
between
the
french
and
the
mamelukes
two
mamelukes
were
able
to
make
head
against
three
frenchmen
because
they
were
better
armed
better
mounted
and
better
trained
they
had
two
pair
of
pistols
a
blunderbuss
a
carbine
a
helmet
with
a
vizor
and
a
coat
of
mail
they
had
several
horses
and
several
attendants
on
foot
one
hundred
cuirassiers
however
were
not
afraid
of
one
hundred
mamelukes
three
hundred
could
beat
an
equal
number
and
one
thousand
could
easily
put
to
the
rout
fifteen
hundred
so
great
is
the
influence
of
tactics
order
and
evolutions
leclerc
and
lasalle
presented
their
men
to
the
mamelukes
in
several
lines
when
the
arabs
were
on
the
point
of
overwhelming
the
first
the
second
came
to
its
assistance
on
the
right
and
left
the
mamelukes
then
halted
and
wheeled
in
order
to
turn
the
wings
of
this
new
line
this
moment
was
always
seized
upon
to
charge
them
and
they
were
uniformly
broken
montholon
history
of
the
captivity
of
napoleon
iv
darius
now
directed
the
chariots
to
be
driven
against
alexander
and
the
phalanx
and
these
formidable
vehicles
were
accordingly
sent
rattling
across
the
plain
against
the
macedonian
line
when
we
remember
the
alarm
which
the
of
the
britons
created
among
caesar
legions
we
shall
not
be
prone
to
deride
this
arm
of
ancient
warfare
as
always
useless
the
object
of
the
chariots
was
to
create
unsteadiness
in
the
ranks
against
which
they
were
driven
and
squadrons
of
cavalry
followed
close
upon
them
to
profit
by
such
disorder
but
the
asiatic
chariots
were
rendered
ineffective
at
arbela
by
the
troops
whom
alexander
had
specially
appointed
for
the
service
and
who
wounding
the
horses
and
drivers
with
their
missile
weapons
and
running
alongside
so
as
to
cut
the
traces
or
seize
the
reins
marred
the
intended
charge
and
the
few
chariots
that
reached
the
phalanx
passed
harmlessly
through
the
intervals
which
the
spearmen
opened
for
them
and
were
easily
captured
in
the
rear
a
mass
of
the
asiatic
cavalry
was
now
for
the
second
time
collected
against
alexander
extreme
right
and
moved
round
it
with
the
view
of
gaining
the
flank
of
his
army
at
the
critical
moment
aretes
with
his
horsemen
from
alexander
second
line
dashed
on
the
persian
squadrons
when
their
own
flanks
were
exposed
by
this
evolution
while
alexander
thus
met
and
baffled
all
the
flanking
attacks
of
the
enemy
with
troops
brought
up
from
his
second
line
he
kept
his
own
and
the
rest
of
the
front
line
of
his
wing
fresh
and
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
opportunity
for
striking
a
decisive
blow
this
soon
came
a
large
body
of
horse
who
were
posted
on
the
persian
left
wing
nearest
to
the
centre
quitted
their
station
and
rode
off
to
help
their
comrades
in
the
cavalry
fight
that
still
was
going
on
at
the
extreme
right
of
alexander
wing
against
the
detachments
from
his
second
line
this
made
a
huge
gap
in
the
persian
array
and
into
this
space
alexander
instantly
dashed
with
his
guard
and
then
pressing
towards
his
left
he
soon
began
to
make
havoc
in
the
left
flank
of
the
persian
centre
the
infantry
now
charged
also
among
the
reeling
masses
of
the
asiatics
and
five
of
the
brigades
of
the
phalanx
with
the
irresistible
might
of
their
sarissas
bore
down
the
greek
mercenaries
of
darius
and
dug
their
way
through
the
persian
centre
in
the
early
part
of
the
battle
darius
had
showed
skill
and
energy
and
he
now
for
some
time
encouraged
his
men
by
voice
and
example
to
keep
firm
but
the
lances
of
alexander
cavalry
and
the
pikes
of
the
phalanx
now
gleamed
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
his
charioteer
was
struck
down
by
a
javelin
at
his
side
and
at
last
darius
nerve
failed
him
and
descending
from
his
chariot
he
mounted
on
a
fleet
horse
and
galloped
from
the
plain
regardless
of
the
state
of
the
battle
in
other
parts
of
the
field
where
matters
were
going
on
much
more
favourably
for
his
cause
and
where
his
presence
might
have
done
much
towards
gaining
a
victory
alexander
operations
with
his
right
and
centre
had
exposed
his
left
to
an
immensely
preponderating
force
of
the
enemy
parmenio
kept
out
of
action
as
long
as
possible
but
mazaeus
who
commanded
the
persian
right
wing
advanced
against
him
completely
outflanked
him
and
pressed
him
severely
with
reiterated
charges
by
superior
numbers
seeing
the
distress
of
parmenio
wing
simmias
who
commanded
the
sixth
brigade
of
the
phalanx
which
was
next
to
the
left
wing
did
not
advance
with
the
other
brigades
in
the
great
charge
upon
the
persian
centre
but
kept
back
to
cover
parmenio
troops
on
their
right
flank
as
otherwise
they
would
have
been
completely
surrounded
and
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
macedonian
army
by
so
doing
simmias
had
unavoidably
opened
a
gap
in
the
macedonian
left
centre
and
a
large
column
of
indian
and
persian
horse
from
the
persian
right
centre
had
galloped
forward
through
this
interval
and
right
through
the
troops
of
the
macedonian
second
line
instead
of
then
wheeling
round
upon
sarmenio
or
upon
the
rear
of
alexander
conquering
wing
the
indian
and
persian
cavalry
rode
straight
on
to
the
macedonian
camp
overpowered
the
thracians
who
were
left
in
charge
of
it
and
began
to
plunder
this
was
stopped
by
the
phalangite
troops
of
the
second
line
who
after
the
enemy
horsemen
had
rushed
by
them
faced
about
countermarched
upon
the
camp
killed
many
of
the
indians
and
persians
in
the
act
of
plundering
and
forced
the
rest
to
ride
off
again
just
at
this
crisis
alexander
had
been
recalled
from
his
pursuit
of
darius
by
tidings
of
the
distress
of
parmenio
and
of
his
inability
to
bear
up
any
longer
against
the
hot
attacks
of
mazaeus
taking
his
with
him
alexander
rode
towards
the
part
of
the
field
where
his
left
wing
was
fighting
but
on
his
way
thither
he
encountered
the
persian
and
indian
cavalry
on
their
return
from
his
camp
these
men
now
saw
that
their
only
chance
of
safety
was
to
cut
their
way
through
and
in
one
huge
column
they
charged
desperately
upon
the
macedonians
there
was
here
a
close
fight
which
lasted
some
time
and
sixty
of
the
royal
fell
and
three
generals
who
fought
close
to
alexander
side
were
wounded
at
length
the
macedonian
discipline
and
valour
again
prevailed
and
a
large
number
of
the
persian
and
indian
horsemen
were
cut
down
some
few
only
succeeded
in
breaking
through
and
riding
away
relieved
of
these
obstinate
enemies
alexander
again
formed
his
and
led
them
towards
parmenio
but
by
this
time
that
general
also
was
victorious
probably
the
news
of
darius
flight
had
reached
mazaeus
and
had
damped
the
ardour
of
the
persian
right
wing
while
the
tidings
of
their
success
must
have
proportionally
encouraged
the
macedonian
forces
under
parmenio
his
thessalian
cavalry
particularly
distinguished
themselves
by
their
gallantry
and
persevering
good
conduct
and
by
the
time
that
alexander
had
ridden
up
to
parmenio
the
whole
persian
army
was
in
full
flight
from
the
field
it
was
of
the
deepest
importance
to
alexander
to
secure
the
person
of
darius
and
he
now
urged
on
the
pursuit
the
river
lycus
was
between
the
field
of
battle
and
the
city
of
arbela
whither
the
fugitives
directed
their
course
and
the
passage
of
this
river
was
even
more
destructive
to
the
persians
than
the
swords
and
spears
of
the
macedonians
had
been
in
the
engagement
i
purposely
omit
any
statement
of
the
loss
in
the
battle
there
is
a
palpable
error
of
the
transcribers
in
the
numbers
which
we
find
in
our
present
manuscripts
of
arrian
and
curtius
is
of
no
authority
the
narrow
bridge
was
soon
choked
up
by
the
flying
thousands
who
rushed
towards
it
and
vast
numbers
of
the
persians
threw
themselves
or
were
hurried
by
others
into
the
rapid
stream
and
perished
in
its
waters
darius
had
crossed
it
and
had
ridden
on
through
arbela
without
halting
alexander
reached
that
city
on
the
next
day
and
made
himself
master
of
all
darius
treasure
and
stores
but
the
persian
king
unfortunately
for
himself
had
fled
too
fast
for
his
conqueror
he
had
only
escaped
to
perish
by
the
treachery
of
his
bactrian
satrap
bessus
a
few
days
after
the
battle
alexander
entered
babylon
the
oldest
seat
of
earthly
empire
then
in
existence
as
its
acknowledged
lord
and
master
there
were
yet
some
campaigns
of
his
brief
and
bright
career
to
be
accomplished
central
asia
was
yet
to
witness
the
march
of
his
phalanx
he
was
yet
to
effect
that
conquest
of
affghanistan
in
which
england
since
has
failed
his
generalship
as
well
as
his
valour
were
yet
to
be
signalised
on
the
banks
of
the
hydaspes
and
the

of
chillianwallah

he
was
yet
to
precede
the
queen
of
england
in
annexing
the
punjaub
to
the
dominions
of
an
european
sovereign
but
the
crisis
of
his
career
was
reached
the
great
object
of
his
mission
was
accomplished
and
the
ancient
persian
empire
which
once
menaced
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
with
subjection
was
irreparably
crushed

alexander
pursued
his
way

appalled
almost
any

the

of
and
to
enforce

of

the

of
his

is
probably
represented
by

near
the
end
of
the

at

marching
in

line
apparently
nearly
parallel
with

the
position

which
must
have
been
on
the

of

at
some
distance
from
attock
and
it
may
perhaps
be
represented
by
the
modern
akora

alexander
marches
through
affghanistan
to
the
punjaub
he
defeats
porus
his
troops
refuse
to
march
towards

alexander
returns
to
babylon
in
the
tenth
year
after
he
had
crossed
the
hellespont
alexander
having
won
his
vast
dominion
entered
babylon
and
resting
from
his
career
in
that
oldest
seat
of
earthly
empire
he
steadily
surveyed
the
mass
of
various
nations
which
owned
his
sovereignty
and
revolved
in
his
mind
the
great
work
of
breathing
into
this
huge
but
inert
body
the
living
spirit
of
greek
civilization
in
the
bloom
of
youthful
manhood
at
the
age
of
he
paused
from
the
fiery
speed
of
his
earlier
course
and
for
the
first
time
gave
the
nations
an
opportunity
of
offering
their
homage
before
his
throne
they
came
from
all
the
extremities
of
the
earth
to
propitiate
his
anger
to
celebrate
his
greatness
or
to
solicit
his
protection
history
may
allow
us
to
think
that
alexander
and
a
roman
ambassador
did
meet
at
babylon
that
the
greatest
man
of
the
ancient
world
saw
and
spoke
with
a
citizen
of
that
great
nation
which
was
destined
to
succeed
him
in
his
appointed
work
and
to
found
a
wider
and
still
more
enduring
empire
they
met
too
in
babylon
almost
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
temple
of

perhaps
the
earliest
monument
ever
raised
by
human
pride

between

the
english

gave
the

held
for

from

the

country
was
the
scene
of
the
principal
military
career
of
each
it
was
in

that
scipio
like
wellington
successively
encountered
and
overthrew
nearly
all
the
subordinate
generals
of
the
enemy
before
being
opposed
to
the
chief
champion
and
conqueror
himself
both
scipio
and
wellington
restored
their
countrymen
confidence
in
arms
when
shaken
by
a
series
of
reverses
and
each
of

closed

perilous

complete
and
overwhelming
defeat

the
foe

them

characters
and

scipio
like
wellington
became
an
important
leader
of
the
aristocratic
party
among
his
countrymen
and
was
exposed
to
the
unmeasured
invectives
of
the
violent
section
of

antagonists
when
early
in

an
infuriated

assaulted
the

of
wellington
in
the
streets
of
the
english
capital
on
the

of

england
was
even
more
disgraced
by
that
outrage
than
rome
was
by
the
factious
accusations
which
demagogues
brought
against
scipio
but
which
he
proudly
repelled
on
the
day
of
trial
by
reminding
the
assembled
people
that
it

the

ignominy

iugratitude

a
voluntary
exile
from
the
malevolent
turbulence
of

englishmen
of
all
ranks
and
politics
have
now
long
united
in
affectionate
admiration
of
our
modern
scipio

even
those
who
have
most
widely
differed
from
the

on

what

power
of

that
power
had
been
already
irreparably
shattered
in
another
field
where
neither
scipio
nor
hannibal
commanded
when
the
metaurus
witnessed
the
defeat
and

of

it
witnessed
the
ruin
of

of
men
they
formed
no

it
was
a
strife
on
the

the
fate
of
two
races

whether
the

should
belong

the

must

pass
away

the

that
formidable
of

dashed
forth

is

amid

supplied
by
the
allusions
of
the
classical
writers
to
gain
a
full
idea
of
the
character
and
institutions
of
rome
great
rival
but
we
can
perceive
how
inferior
carthage
was
to
her
competitor
in
military
resources
and
how
far
less
fitted
than
rome
she
was
to
become
the
founder
of
centralized
and
centralizing
dominion
that
should
endure
for
centuries
and
fuse
into
imperial
unity
the
narrow
nationalities
of
the
ancient
races
that
dwelt
around
and
near
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
sea
carthage
was
originally
neither
the
most
ancient
nor
the
most
powerful
of
the
numerous
colonies
which
the
phoenicians
planted
on
the
coast
of
northern
africa
but
her
advantageous
position
the
excellence
of
her
constitution
of
which
though
as
to
its
details
we
know
that
it
commanded
the
admiration
of
aristotle
and
the
commercial
and
political
energy
of
her
citizens
gave
her
the
ascendancy
over
hippo
utica
leptis
and
her
other
sister
phoenician
cities
in
those
regions
and
she
finally
seduced
them
to
a
condition
of
dependency
similar
to
that
which
the
subject
allies
of
athens
occupied
relatively
to
that
once
imperial
city
when
tyre
and
sidon
and
the
other
cities
of
phoenicia
itself
sank
from
independent
republics
into
mere
vassal
states
of
the
great
asiatic
monarchies
and
obeyed
by
turns
a
babylonian
a
persian
and
a
macedonian
master
their
power
and
their
traffic
rapidly
declined
and
carthage
succeeded
to
the
important
maritime
and
commercial
character
which
they
had
previously
maintained
the
carthaginians
did
not
seek
to
compete
with
the
greeks
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
or
in
the
three
inland
seas
which
are
connected
with
it
but
they
maintained
an
active
intercourse
with
the
phoenicians
and
through
them
with
lower
and
central
asia
and
they
and
they
alone
after
the
decline
and
fall
of
tyre
navigated
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
they
had
the
monopoly
of
all
the
commerce
of
the
world
that
was
carried
on
beyond
the
straits
of
gibraltar
we
have
yet
extant
in
a
greek
translation
the
narrative
of
the
voyage
of
hanno
one
of
their
admirals
along
the
western
coast
of
africa
as
far
as
sierra
leone
and
in
the
latin
poem
of
festus
avienus
frequent
references
are
made
to
the
records
of
the
voyages
of
another
celebrated
carthaginian
admiral
himilco
who
had
explored
the
coast
of
europe
our
own
islands
are
mentioned
by
himilco
as
the
lands
of
the
hiberni
and
the
albioni
it
is
indeed
certain
that
the
carthaginians
frequented
the
cornish
coast
as
the
phoenicians
had
done
before
them
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
tin
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
sailed
as
far
as
the
coasts
of
the
baltic
for
amber
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
mariner
compass
was
unknown
in
those
ages
the
boldness
and
skill
of
the
seamen
of
carthage
and
the
enterprise
of
her
merchants
may
be
paralleled
with
any
achievements
that
the
history
of
modern
navigation
and
commerce
can
supply
in
their
atlantic
voyages
along
the
african
shores
the
carthaginians
followed
the
double
object
of
trade
and
colonization
the
numerous
settlements
that
were
planted
by
them
along
the
coast
from
morocco
to
senegal
provided
for
the
needy
members
of
the
population
of
a
great
commercial
capital
and
also
strengthened
the
influence
which
carthage
exercised
among
the
tribes
of
the
african
coast
besides
her
fleets
her
caravans
gave
her
a
large
and
lucrative
trade
with
the
native
africans
nor
must
we
limit
our
belief
of
the
extent
of
the
carthaginian
trade
with
the
tribes
of
central
and
western
africa
by
the
narrowness
of
the
commercial
intercourse
which
civilized
nations
of
modern
times
have
been
able
to
create
in
those
regions
although
essentially
a
mercantile
and
seafaring
people
the
carthaginians
by
no
means
neglected
agriculture
on
the
contrary
the
whole
of
their
territory
was
cultivated
like
a
garden
the
fertility
of
the
soil
repaid
the
skill
and
toil
bestowed
on
it
and
every
invader
from
agathocles
to
scipio
aemilianus
was
struck
with
admiration
at
the
rich
carefully
irrigated
the
abundant
harvests
the
luxuriant
vineyards
the
plantations
of
fig
and
the
thriving
villages
the
populous
towns
and
the
splendid
villas
of
the
wealthy
carthaginians
through
which
his
march
lay
as
long
as
he
was
on
carthaginian
ground
the
carthaginians
abandoned
the
aegean
and
the
pontus
to
the
greeks
but
they
were
by
no
means
disposed
to
relinquish
to
those
rivals
the
commerce
and
the
dominion
of
the
coasts
of
the
mediterranean
westward
of
italy
for
centuries
the
carthaginians
strove
to
make
themselves
masters
of
the
islands
that
lie
between
italy
and
spain
they
acquired
the
balearic
islands
where
the
principal
harbour
port
mahon
still
bears
the
name
of
the
carthaginian
admiral
they
succeeded
in
reducing
the
greater
part
of
sardinia
but
sicily
could
never
be
brought
into
their
power
they
repeatedly
invaded
that
island
and
nearly
overran
it
but
the
resistance
which
was
opposed
to
them
by
the
syracusans
under
gelon
dionysius
timoleon
and
agathocles
preserved
the
island
from
becoming
punic
though
many
of
its
cities
remained
under
the
carthaginian
rule
until
rome
finally
settled
the
question
to
whom
sicily
was
to
belong
by
conquering
it
for
herself
with
so
many
elements
of
success
with
almost
unbounded
wealth
with
commercial
and
maritime
activity
with
a
fertile
territory
with
a
capital
city
of
almost
impregnable
strength
with
a
constitution
that
ensured
for
centuries
the
blessings
of
social
order
with
an
aristocracy
singularly
fertile
in
men
of
the
highest
genius
carthage
yet
failed
signally
and
calamitously
in
her
contest
for
power
with
rome
one
of
the
immediate
causes
of
this
may
seem
to
have
been
the
want
of
firmness
among
her
citizens
which
made
them
terminate
the
first
punic
war
by
begging
peace
sooner
than
endure
any
longer
the
hardships
and
burdens
caused
by
a
state
of
warfare
although
their
antagonists
had
suffered
far
more
severely
than
themselves
another
cause
was
the
spirit
of
faction
among
their
leading
men
which
prevented
hannibal
in
the
second
war
from
being
properly
reinforced
and
supported
but
there
were
also
more
general
causes
why
carthage
proved
inferior
to
rome
these
were
her
position
relatively
to
the
mass
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
which
she
ruled
and
her
habit
of
trusting
to
mercenary
armies
in
her
wars
our
clearest
information
as
to
the
different
races
of
men
in
and
about
carthage
is
derived
from
diodorus
siculus
vol
ii
ed
that
historian
enumerates
four
different
races
first
he
mentions
the
phoenicians
who
dwelt
in
carthage
next
he
speaks
of
the
these
he
tells
us
dwelt
in
many
of
the
maritime
cities
and
were
connected
by
intermarriages
with
the
phoenicians
which
was
the
cause
of
their
compound
name
thirdly
he
mentions
the
libyans
the
bulk
and
the
most
ancient
part
of
the
population
hating
the
carthaginians
intensely
on
account
of
the
oppressiveness
of
their
domination
lastly
he
names
the
numidians
the
nomad
tribes
of
the
frontier
it
is
evident
from
this
description
that
the
native
libyans
were
a
subject
class
without
franchise
or
political
rights
and
accordingly
we
find
no
instance
specified
in
history
of
a
libyan
holding
political
office
or
military
command
the
the
seem
to
have
been
sometimes
sent
out
as
colonists
see
the
periplus
of
hanno
but
it
may
be
inferred
from
what
diodorus
says
of
their
residence
that
they
had
not
the
right
of
the
citizenship
of
carthage
and
only
a
solitary
case
occurs
of
one
of
this
race
being
entrusted
with
authority
and
that
too
not
emanating
from
the
home
government
this
is
the
instance
of
the
officer
sent
by
hannibal
to
sicily
after
the
fall
of
syracuse
whom
polybius
lib
ix
calls
myttinus
the
libyan
but
whom
from
the
fuller
account
in
livy
we
find
to
have
been
a
lib
xxv
and
it
is
expressly
mentioned
what
indignation
was
felt
by
the
carthaginian
commanders
in
the
island
that
this
should
control
their
operations
with
respect
to
the
composition
of
their
armies
it
is
observable
that
though
thirsting
for
extended
empire
and
though
some
of
the
leading
men
became
generals
of
the
highest
order
the
carthaginians
as
a
people
were
anything
but
personally
warlike
as
long
as
they
could
hire
mercenaries
to
fight
for
them
they
had
little
appetite
for
the
irksome
training
and
they
grudged
the
loss
of
valuable
time
which
military
service
would
have
entailed
on
themselves
as
michelet
remarks
the
life
of
an
industrious
merchant
of
a
carthaginian
was
too
precious
to
be
risked
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
substitute
advantageously
for
it
that
of
a
barbarian
from
spain
or
gaul
carthage
knew
and
could
tell
to
a
drachma
what
the
life
of
a
man
of
each
nation
came
to
a
greek
was
worth
more
than
a
campanian
a
campanian
worth
more
than
a
gaul
or
a
spaniard
when
once
this
tariff
of
blood
was
correctly
made
out
carthage
began
a
war
as
a
mercantile
speculation
she
tried
to
make
conquests
in
the
hope
of
getting
new
mines
to
work
or
to
open
fresh
markets
for
her
exports
in
one
venture
she
could
afford
to
spend
fifty
thousand
mercenaries
in
another
rather
more
if
the
returns
were
good
there
was
no
regret
felt
for
the
capital
that
had
been
lavished
in
the
investment
more
money
got
more
men
and
all
went
on
well

armies
composed
of
foreign
mercenaries
have
in
all
ages
been
as
formidable
to
their
employers
as
to
the
enemy
against
whom
they
were
directed
we
know
of
one
occasion
between
the
first
and
second
punic
wars
when
carthage
was
brought
to
the
very
brink
of
destruction
by
a
revolt
of
her
foreign
troops
other
mutinies
of
the
same
kind
must
from
time
to
time
have
occurred
probably
one
of
these
was
the
cause
of
the
comparative
weakness
of
carthage
at
the
time
of
the
athenian
expedition
against
syracuse
so
different
from
the
energy
with
which
she
attacked
gelon
half
a
century
earlier
and
dionysius
half
a
century
later
and
even
when
we
consider
her
armies
with
reference
only
to
their
efficiency
in
warfare
we
perceive
at
once
the
inferiority
of
such
bands
of
condottieri
brought
together
without
any
common
bond
of
origin
tactics
or
cause
to
the
legions
of
rome
which
at
the
time
of
the
punic
wars
were
raised
from
the
very
flower
of
a
hardy
agricultural
population
trained
in
the
strictest
discipline
habituated
to
victory
and
animated
by
the
most
resolute
patriotism
and
this
shows
also
the
transcendency
of
the
genius
of
hannibal
which
could
form
such
discordant
materials
into
a
compact
organized
force
and
inspire
them
with
the
spirit
of
patient
discipline
and
loyalty
to
their
chief
so
that
they
were
true
to
him
in
his
adverse
as
well
as
in
his
prosperous
fortunes
and
throughout
the
chequered
series
of
his
campaigns
no
panic
rout
ever
disgraced
a
division
under
his
command
no
mutiny
or
even
attempt
at
mutiny
was
ever
known
in
his
camp
and
finally
after
fifteen
years
of
italian
warfare
his
men
followed
their
old
leader
to
zama
with
no
fear
and
little
hope
we

there
on

around

came
up
on
their
flank
when
at
last
surrounded
and
overpowered

sealed
their
devotion
to
their
general
with
their
blood
but
if
hannibal
genius
may
be
likened
to
the
homeric
god
who
in
his
hatred
to
the
trojans
rises
from
the
deep
to
rally
the
fainting
greeks
and
to
lead
them
against
the
enemy
so
the
calm
courage
with
which

met
his
more
than
human
adversary
in
his
country
cause
is
no
unworthy
image
of
the
unyielding
magnanimity
displayed
by
the
aristocracy
of
rome
as
hannibal
utterly
eclipses
carthage
so
on
the
contrary
fabius

even

are
as
nothing
when
compared

which
voted
its
thanks
to
its
political
enemy

not

which
disdained
either
to

to
reprove

to
threaten
or
in
any
way
to
notice
the
twelve
colonies
which
had
refused
their
customary
supplies
of
men
for
the
army
is
far
more
to
be
honoured
than
the
conqueror
of
zama
this
we
should
the
more
carefully
bear
in
mind
because
our
tendency
is
to
admire
individual
greatness
far
more
than
national
and
as
no
single
roman
will
bear
comparison
to
hannibal
we
are
apt
to
murmur
at
the
event
of
the
contest
and
to
think
that
the
victory
was
awarded
to
the
least
worthy
of
the
combatants
on
the
contrary
never
was
the
wisdom
of
god
providence
more
manifest
than
in
the
issue
of
the
struggle
between
rome
and
carthage
it
was
clearly
for
the
good
of
man
kind
that
hannibal
should
be
conquered
his
triumph
would
have
stopped
the
progress
of
the
world
for
great
men
can
only
act
permanently
by
forming
great
nations
and
no
one
man
even
though
it
were
hannibal
himself
can
in
one
generation
effect
such
a
work
but
where
the
nation
has
been
merely
enkindled
for
a
while
by
a
great
spirit
the
light
passes
away
with
him
who
communicated
it
and
the
nation
when
he
is
gone
is
like
a
dead
body
to
which
magic
power
had
for
a
moment
given
unnatural
life
when
the
charm
has
ceased
the
body
is
cold
and
stiff
as
before
he
who
grieves
over
the
battle
of
zama
should
carry
on
his
thoughts
to
a
period
thirty
years
later
when
hannibal
must
in
the
course
of
nature
have
been
dead
and
consider
how
the
isolated
phoenician
city
of
carthage
was
fitted
to
receive
and
to
consolidate
the
civilization
of
greece
or
by
its
laws
and
institutions
to
bind
together
barbarians
of
every
race
and
language
into
an
organized

cut
off

incomplete
it
was
in

spring
of
that

after
skilfully
disentangling
himself
from

in

and
after
a
march
conducted
with
great
judgment
and
little
loss
through
the
interior

of

appeared
in

that
now
is
the
north
of

at

partly
brought
out
of

partly
levied

and
ligurians
on
his
way
at
this
time
hannibal
with
his
unconquered
and
seemingly
unconquerable
army
had
been
eleven
years
in
italy
executing
with
strenuous
ferocity
the
vow
of
hatred
to
rome
which
had
been
sworn
by
him
while
yet
a
child
at
the
bidding
of
his
father
hamilcar
who
as
he
boasted
had
trained
up
his
three
sons
hannibal
hasdrubal
and
mago
like
three
whelps
to
prey
upon
the
romans
but
hannibal
latter
campaigns
had
not
been
signalised
by
any
such
great
victories
as
marked
the
first
years
of
his
invasion
of
italy
the
stern
spirit
of
roman
resolution
ever
highest
in
disaster
and
danger
had
neither
bent
nor
despaired
beneath
the
merciless
blows
which
the
dire
african
dealt
her
in
rapid
succession
at
trebia
at
thrasymene
and
at
cannae
her
population
was
thinned
by
repeated
slaughter
in
the
field
poverty
and
actual
scarcity
wore
down
the
survivors
through
the
fearful
ravages
which
cavalry
spread
through
their
their
and
their
vineyards
many
of
her
allies
went
over
to
the
invader
side
and
new
clouds
of
foreign
war
threatened
her
from
macedonia
and
gaul
but
rome
receded
not
rich
and
poor
among
her
citizens
vied
with
each
other
in
devotion
to
their
country
the
wealthy
placed
their
stores
and
all
placed
their
lives
at
the
state
disposal
and
though
hannibal
could
not
be
driven
out
of
italy
though
every
year
brought
its
sufferings
and
sacrifices
rome
felt
that
her
constancy
had
not
been
exerted
in
vain
if
she
was
weakened
by
the
continual
strife
so
was
hannibal
also
and
it
was
clear
that
the
unaided
resources
of
his
army
were
unequal
to
the
task
of
her
destruction
the
single
could
not
pull
down
the
quarry
which
he
had
so
furiously
assailed
rome
not
only
stood
fiercely
at
bay
but
had
pressed
back
and
gored
her
antagonist
that
still
however
watched
her
in
act
to
spring
she
was
weary
and
bleeding
at
every
pore
and
there
seemed
to
be
little
hope
of
her
escape

hound
of

race
should
come
up
in

had
commanded
the
carthaginian
armies
in

for
some
time
with
varying
but
generally
unpropitious
fortune
he
had
not
the
full
authority
over
the
punic
forces
in
that
country
which
his
brother
and
his
father
had
previously
exercised

faction

time

sent

whose
errors
and
misconduct
caused
the
reverses
that
hasdrubal
met
with
this
is
expressly
attested
by
the
greek
historian
polybius
who
was
the
intimate
friend
of

younger
africanus

best
possible
authorities
livy
gives
a
long
narrative
of
campaigns
between
the
roman
commanders
in
spain
and
hasdrubal
which
is
so
palpably
deformed
by
fictions
and
exaggerations
as
to
be
hardly
deserving
of
attention

excellent
criticisms
of
sir
walter
raleigh
on
this
in
his
history
of
the
world
book
chap
iii
sec
it
is
clear
that
in
the
year
at
least
hasdrubal
outmanoeuvred
publius
scipio
who
held
the
command
of
the
roman
forces
in
spain
and
whose
object
was
to
prevent
him
from
passing
the
pyrenees
and
marching
upon
italy
scipio
expected
that
hasdrubal
would
attempt
the
nearest
route
along
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
and
he
therefore
carefully
fortified
and
guarded
the
passes
of
the
eastern
pyrenees
but
hasdrubal
passed
these
mountains
near
their
western
extremity
and
then
with
a
considerable
force
of
spanish
infantry
with
a
small
number
of
african
troops
with
some
elephants
and
much
treasure
he
marched
not
directly
towards
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
but
in
a
line
towards
the
centre
of
gaul
he
halted
for
the
winter
in
the
territory
of
the
arverni
the
modern
auvergne
and
conciliated
or
purchased
the
of
the
gauls
in
that
region
so
far
that
he
not
only
found
friendly
winter
quarters
among
them
but
great
numbers
of
them
enlisted
under
him
and
on
the
approach
of
spring
marched
with
him
to
invade
italy
by
thus
entering
gaul
at
the
and
avoiding
its
southern
maritime
districts
hasdrubal
kept
the
romans
in
complete
ignorance
of
his
precise
operations
and
movements
in
that
country
all
that
they
knew
was
that
hasdrubal
had
baffled
scipio
attempts
to
detain
him
in
spain
that
he
had
crossed
the
pyrenees
with
soldiers
elephants
and
money
and
that
he
was
raising
fresh
forces
among
the
gauls
the
spring
was
sure
to
bring
him
into
italy
and
then
would
come
the
real
tempest
of
the
war
when
from
the
north
and
from
the
south
the
two
carthaginian
armies
each
under
a
son
of
the
thunderbolt
were
to
gather
together
around
the
seven
hills
of
rome
hamilcar
was
surnamed
barca
which
means
the
thunderbolt
sultan
bajazet
had
the
similar
surname
of
yilderim
in
this
emergency
the
romans
looked
among
themselves
earnestly
and
anxiously
for
leaders
fit
to
meet
the
perils
of
the
coming
campaign
the
senate
recommended
the
people
to
elect
as
one
of
their
consuls
caius
claudius
nero
a
patrician
of
one
of
the
families
of
the
great
claudian
house
nero
had
served
during
the
preceding
years
of
the
war
both
against
hannibal
in
italy
and
against
hasdrubal
in
spain
but
it
is
remarkable
that
the
histories
which
we
possess
record
no
successes
as
having
been
achieved
by
him
either
before
or
after
his
great
campaign
of
the
metaurus
it
proves
much
for
the
sagacity
of
the
leading
men
of
the
senate
that
they
recognised
in
nero
the
energy
and
spirit
which
were
required
at
this
crisis
and
it
is
equally
creditable
to
the
patriotism
of
the
people
that
they
followed
the
advice
of
the
senate
by
electing
a
general
who
had
no
showy
exploits
to
recommend
him
to
their
choice
it
was
a
matter
of
greater
difficulty
to
find
a
second
consul
the
laws
required
that
one
consul
should
be
a
plebeian
and
the
plebeian
nobility
had
been
fearfully
thinned
by
the
events
of
the
war
while
the
senators
anxiously
deliberated
among
themselves
what
fit
colleague
for
nero
could
be
nominated
at
the
coming
comitia
and
sorrowfully
recalled
the
names
of
marcellus
gracchus
and
other
plebeian
generals
who
were
no
more
one
taciturn
and
moody
old
man
sat
in
sullen
apathy
among
the
conscript
fathers
this
was
marcus
livius
who
had
been
consul
in
the
gear
before
the
beginning
of
this
war
and
had
then
gained
a
victory
over
the
illyrians
after
his
consulship
he
had
been
impeached
before
the
people
on
a
charge
of
peculation
and
unfair
division
of
the
spoils
among
his
soldiers
the
verdict
was
unjustly
given
against
him
and
the
sense
of
this
wrong
and
of
the
indignity
thus
put
upon
him
had
rankled
unceasingly
in
the
bosom
of
livius
so
that
for
eight
years
after
his
trial
he
had
lived
in
seclusion
at
his
country
seat
taking
no
part
in
any
affairs
of
state
latterly
the
censors
had
compelled
him
to
come
to
rome
and
resume
his
place
in
the
senate
where
he
used
to
sit
gloomily
apart
giving
only
a
silent
vote
at
last
an
unjust
accusation
against
one
of
his
near
kinsmen
made
him
break
silence
and
he
harangued
the
house
in
words
of
weight
and
sense
which
drew
attention
to
him
and
taught
the
senators
that
a
strong
spirit
dwelt
beneath
that
unimposing
exterior
now
while
they
were
debating
on
what
noble
of
a
plebeian
house
was
fit
to
assume
the
perilous
honours
of
the
consulate
some
of
the
elder
of
them
looked
on
marcus
livius
and
remembered
that
in
the
very
last
triumph
which
had
been
celebrated
in
the
streets
of
rome
this
grim
old
man
had
sat
in
the
car
of
victory
and
that
he
had
offered
the
last
grand
thanksgiving
sacrifice
for
the
success
of
the
roman
arms
that
had
bled
before
capitoline
jove
there
had
been
no
triumphs
since
hannibal
came
into
italy
marcellus
had
been
only
allowed
an
ovation
for
the
conquest
of
syracuse
the
illyrian
campaign
of
livius
was
the
last
that
had
been
so
honoured
perhaps
it
might
be
destined
for
him
now
to
renew
the
series
the
senators
resolved
that
livius
should
be
put
in
nomination
as
consul
with
nero
the
people
were
willing
to
elect
him
the
only
opposition
came
from
himself
he
taunted
them
with
their
inconsistency
is
honouring
a
man
they
had
convicted
of
a
base
crime
if
i
am
innocent
said
he
why
did
you
place
such
a
stain
on
me
if
i
am
guilty
why
am
i
more
fit
for
a
second
consulship
than
i
was
for
my
first
one
the
other
senators
remonstrated
with
him
urging
the
example
of
the
great
camillus
who
after
an
unjust
condemnation
on
a
similar
charge
both
served
and
saved
his
country
at
last
livius
ceased
to
object
and
caius
claudius
nero
and
marcus
livius
were
chosen
consuls
of
rome
a
quarrel
had
long
existed
between
the
two
consuls
and
the
senators
strove
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
them
before
the
campaign
here
again
livius
for
a
long
time
obstinately
resisted
the
wish
of
his
he
said
it
was
best
for
the
state
that
he
and
nero
should
continue
to
hate
one
another
each
would
do
his
duty
better
when
he
knew
that
he
was
watched
by
an
enemy
in
the
person
of
his
own
colleague
at
last
the
entreaties
of
the
senators
prevailed
and
livius
consented
to
forego
the
feud
and
to
with
nero
in
preparing
for
the
coming
struggle
as
soon
as
the
winter
snows
were
thawed
hasdrubal
commenced
his
march
from
auvergne
to
the
alps
he
experienced
none
of
the
difficulties
which
his
brother
had
met
with
from
the
mountain
tribes
hannibal
army
had
been
the
first
body
of
regular
troops
that
had
ever
traversed
the
regions
and
as
wild
animals
assail
a
traveller
the
natives
rose
against
it
instinctively
in
imagined
defence
of
their
own
habitations
which
they
supposed
to
be
the
objects
of
carthaginian
ambition
but
the
fame
of
the
war
with
which
italy
had
now
been
convulsed
for
eleven
years
had
penetrated
into
the
alpine
passes
and
the
mountaineers
understood
that
a
mighty
city
southward
of
the
alps
was
to
be
attacked
by
the
troops
whom
they
saw
marching
among
them
they
not
only
opposed
no
resistance
to
the
passage
of
hasdrubal
but
many
of
them
out
of
the
love
of
enterprise
and
plunder
or
allured
by
the
high
pay
that
he
offered
took
service
with
him
and
thus
he
advanced
upon
italy
with
an
army
that
gathered
strength
at
every
league
it
is
said
also
that
some
of
the
most
important
engineering
works
which
hannibal
had
constructed
were
found
by
hasdrubal
still
in
existence
and
materially
favoured
the
speed
of
his
advance
he
thus
emerged
into
italy
from
the
alpine
valleys
much
sooner
than
had
been
anticipated
many
warriors
of
the
ligurian
tribes
joined
him
and
crossing
the
river
po
he
marched
down
its
southern
bank
to
the
city
of
placentia
which
he
wished
to
secure
as
a
base
for
his
future
operations
placentia
resisted
him
as
bravely
as
it
had
resisted
hannibal
eleven
years
before
and
for
some
time
hasdrubal
was
occupied
with
a
fruitless
siege
before
its
walls
six
armies
were
levied
for
the
defence
of
italy
when
the
approach
of
hasdrubal
was
announced
seventy
thousand
romans
served
in
the
fifteen
legions
of
which
with
an
equal
number
of
italian
allies
those
armies
and
the
garrisons
were
composed
upwards
of
thirty
thousand
more
romans
were
serving
in
sicily
sardinia
and
spain
the
whole
number
of
roman
citizens
of
an
age
fit
for
military
duty
scarcely
exceeded
a
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
the
census
taken
before
the
war
had
shown
a
total
of
two
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
which
had
been
diminished
by
more
than
half
during
twelve
years
these
numbers
are
fearfully
emphatic
of
the
extremity
to
which
rome
was
reduced
and
of
her
gigantic
efforts
in
that
great
agony
of
her
fate
not
merely
men
but
money
and
military
stores
were
drained
to
the
utmost
and
if
the
armies
of
that
year
should
be
swept
off
by
a
repetition
of
the
slaughters
of
thrasymene
and
cannae
all
felt
that
rome
would
cease
to
exist
even
if
the
campaign
were
to
be
marked
by
no
decisive
success
on
either
side
her
ruin
seemed
certain
in
south
italy
hannibal
had
either
detached
rome
allies
from
her
or
had
impoverished
them
by
the
ravages
of
his
army
if
hasdrubal
could
have
done
the
same
in
upper
italy
if
etruria
umbria
and
northern
latium
had
either
revolted
or
been
laid
waste
rome
must
have
sunk
beneath
sheer
starvation
for
the
hostile
or
desolated
territory
would
have
yielded
no
supplies
of
corn
for
her
population
and
money
to
purchase
it
from
abroad
there
was
none
instant
victory
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
three
of
her
six
armies
were
ordered
to
the
north
but
the
first
of
these
was
required
to
overawe
the
disaffected
etruscans
the
second
army
of
the
north
was
pushed
forward
under
porcius
the
praetor
to
meet
and
keep
in
check
the
advanced
troops
of
hasdrubal
while
the
third
the
grand
army
of
the
north
which
was
to
be
under
the
immediate
command
of
the
consul
livius
who
had
the
chief
command
in
all
north
italy
advanced
more
slowly
in
its
support
there
were
similarly
three
armies
in
the
south
under
the
orders
of
the
other
consul
claudius
nero
the
lot
had
decided
that
livius
was
to
be
opposed
to
hasdrubal
and
that
nero
should
face
hannibal
and
when
all
was
ordered
as
themselves
thought
best
the
two
consuls
went
forth
of
the
city
each
his
several
way
the
people
of
rome
were
now
quite
otherwise
affected
than
they
had
been
when
aemilius
paulus
and
tarentius
varro
were
sent
against
hannibal
they
did
no
longer
take
upon
them
to
direct
their
generals
or
bid
them
dispatch
and
win
the
victory
betimes
but
rather
they
stood
in
fear
lest
all
diligence
wisdom
and
valour
should
prove
too
little
for
since
few
years
had
passed
wherein
some
one
of
their
generals
had
not
been
slain
and
since
it
was
manifest
that
if
either
of
these
present
consuls
were
defeated
or
put
to
the
worst
the
two
carthaginians
would
forthwith
join
and
make
short
work
with
the
other
it
seemed
a
greater
happiness
than
could
be
expected
that
each
of
them
should
return
home
victor
and
come
off
with
honour
from
such
mighty
opposition
as
he
was
like
to
find
with
extreme
difficulty
had
rome
held
up
her
head
ever
since
the
battle
of
cannae
though
it
were
so
that
hannibal
alone
with
little
help
from
carthage
had
continued
the
war
in
italy
but
there
was
now
arrived
another
son
of
amilcar
and
one
that
in
his
present
expedition
had
seemed
a
man
of
more
sufficiency
than
hannibal
himself
for
whereas
in
that
long
and
dangerous
march
through
barbarous
nations
over
great
rivers
and
mountains
that
were
thought
unpassable
hannibal
had
lost
a
great
part
of
his
army
this
asdrubal
in
the
same
places
had
multiplied
his
numbers
and
gathering
the
people
that
he
found
in
the
way
descended
from
the
alps
like
a
rolling
far
greater
than
he
came
over
the
pyrenees
at
his
first
setting
out
of
spain
these
considerations
and
the
like
of
which
fear
presented
many
unto
them
caused
the
people
of
rome
to
wait
upon
their
consuls
out
of
the
town
like
a
pensive
train
of
mourners
thinking
upon
marcellus
and
crispinus
upon
whom
in
the
like
sort
they
had
given
attendance
the
last
year
but
saw
neither
of
them
return
alive
from
a
less
dangerous
war
particularly
old
fabius
gave
his
accustomed
advice
to
livius
that
he
should
abstain
from
giving
or
taking
battle
until
he
well
understood
the
enemies
condition
but
the
consul
made
him
a
froward
answer
and
said
that
he
would
fight
the
very
first
day
for
that
he
thought
it
long
till
he
should
either
recover
his
honour
by
victory
or
by
seeing
the
overthrow
of
his
own
unjust
citizens
satisfy
himself
with
the
joy
of
a
great
though
not
an
honest
revenge
but
his
meaning
was
better
than
his
words
sir
walter
raleigh
hannibal
at
this
period
occupied
with
his
veteran
but
much
reduced
forces
the
extreme
south
of
italy
it
had
not
been
expected
either
by
friend
or
foe
that
hasdrubal
would
effect
his
passage
of
the
alps
so
early
in
the
year
as
actually
occurred
and
even
when
hannibal
learned
that
his
brother
was
in
italy
and
had
advanced
as
far
as
placentia
he
was
obliged
to
pause
for
further
intelligence
before
he
himself
commenced
active
operations
as
he
could
not
tell
whether
his
brother
might
not
be
invited
into
etruria
to
aid
the
party
there
that
was
disaffected
to
rome
or
whether
he
would
march
down
by
the
adriatic
sea
hannibal
led
his
troops
out
of
their
winter
quarters
in
bruttium
and
marched
northward
as
far
as
canusium
nero
had
his
near
venusia
with
an
army
which
he
had
increased
to
forty
thousand
foot
and
two
thousand
five
hundred
horse
by
incorporating
under
his
own
command
some
of
the
legions
which
had
been
intended
to
set
under
other
generals
in
the
south
there
was
another
roman
army
twenty
thousand
strong
south
of
hannibal
at
tarentum
the
strength
of
that
city
secured
this
roman
force
from
any
attack
by
hannibal
and
it
was
a
serious
matter
to
march
northward
and
leave
it
in
his
rear
free
to
act
against
all
his
depots
and
allies
in
the
friendly
part
of
italy
which
for
the
last
two
or
three
campaigns
had
served
him
for
a
base
of
his
operations
moreover
nero
army
was
so
strong
that
hannibal
could
not
concentrate
troops
enough
to
assume
the
offensive
against
it
without
weakening
his
garrisons
and
relinquishing
at
least
for
a
time
his
grasp
upon
the
southern
provinces
to
do
this
before
he
was
certainly
informed
of
his
brother
operations
would
have
been
an
useless
sacrifice
as
nero
could
retreat
before
him
upon
the
other
roman
armies
near
the
capital
and
hannibal
knew
by
experience
that
a
mere
advance
of
his
army
upon
the
walls
of
rome
would
have
no
effect
on
the
fortunes
of
the
war
in
the
hope
probably
of
inducing
nero
to
follow
him
and
of
gaining
an
opportunity
of
outmanoeuvring
the
roman
consul
and
attacking
him
on
his
march
hannibal
moved
into
lucania
and
then
back
into
apulis
he
again
marched
down
into
bruttium
and
strengthened
his
army
by
a
levy
of
recruits
in
that
district
nero
followed
him
but
gave
him
no
chance
of
assailing
him
at
a
disadvantage
some
partial
encounters
seem
to
have
taken
place
but
the
consul
could
not
prevent
hannibal
junction
with
his
bruttian
levies
nor
could
hannibal
gain
an
opportunity
of
surprising
and
crushing
the
consul
hannibal
returned
to
his
former
at
canusium
and
halted
there
in
expectation
of
further
tidings
of
his
brother
movements
nero
also
resumed
his
former
position
in
observation
of
the
carthaginian
army
the
annalists
whom
livy
copied
spoke
of
nero
gaining
repeated
victories
over
hannibal
and
killing
and
taking
his
men
by
tens
of
thousands
the
falsehood
of
all
this
is
if
nero
could
thus
always
beat
hannibal
the
romans
would
not
have
been
in
such
an
agony
of
dread
about
hasdrubal
as
all
writers
describe
indeed
we
have
the
express
testimony
of
polybius
that
such
statements
as
we
read
in
livy
of
marcellus
nero
and
others
gaining
victories
over
hannibal
in
italy
must
be
all
fabrications
of
roman
vanity
polybius
states
lib
xv
sec
that
hannibal
was
never
defeated
before
the
battle
of
zama
and
in
another
passage
book
ix
chap
he
mentions
that
after
the
defeats
which
hannibal
inflicted
on
the
romans
in
the
early
years
of
the
war
they
no
longer
dared
face
his
army
in
a
pitched
battle
on
a
fair
field
and
yet
they
resolutely
maintained
the
war
he
rightly
explains
this
by
referring
to
the
superiority
of
hannibal
cavalry
the
arm
which
gained
him
all
his
victories
by
keeping
within
fortified
lines
or
close
to
the
sides
of
the
mountains
when
hannibal
approached
them
the
romans
rendered
his
cavalry
ineffective
and
a
glance
at
the
geography
of
italy
will
show
how
an
army
can
traverse
the
greater
part
of
that
country
without
venturing
far
from
the
high
grounds
meanwhile
hasdrubal
had
raised
the
siege
of
placentia
and
was
advancing
towards
ariminum
on
the
adriatic
and
driving
before
him
the
roman
army
under
porcina
nor
when
the
consul
livius
had
come
up
and
united
the
second
and
third
armies
of
the
north
could
he
make
head
against
the
invaders
the
romans
still
fell
back
before
hasdrubal
beyond
ariminum
beyond
the
metaurus
and
as
far
as
the
little
town
of
sena
to
the
southeast
of
that
river
hasdrubal
was
not
unmindful
of
the
necessity
of
acting
in
concert
with
his
brother
he
sent
messengers
to
hannibal
to
announce
his
own
line
of
march
and
to
propose
that
they
should
unite
their
armies
in
south
umbria
and
then
wheel
round
against
rome
those
messengers
traversed
the
greater
part
of
italy
in
safety
but
when
close
to
the
object
of
their
mission
were
captured
by
a
roman
detachment
and
hasdrubal
letter
detailing
his
whole
plan
of
the
campaign
was
laid
not
in
his
brother
hands
but
in
those
of
the
commander
of
the
roman
armies
of
the
south
nero
saw
at
once
the
full
importance
of
the
crisis
the
two
sons
of
hamilcar
were
now
within
two
hundred

nero
instantly
ordered
seven
thousand
picked
men
a
thousand
being
cavalry
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
for
a
secret
expedition
against
one
of
hannibal
garrisons
and
as
soon
as
night
had
set
in
he
hurried
forward
on
his
bold
enterprise
but
he
quickly
left
the
southern
road
towards
lucania
and
wheeling
round
pressed
northward
with
the
utmost
rapidity
towards
picenum
he
had
during
the
preceding
afternoon
sent
messengers
to
rome
who
were
to
lay
hasdrubal
letters
before
the
senate
there
was
a
law
forbidding
a
consul
to
make
war
or
to
march
his
army
beyond
the
limits
of
the
province
assigned
to
him
but
in
such
an
emergency
nero
did
not
wait
for
the
permission
of
the
senate
to
execute
his
project
but
informed
them
that
he
was
already
on
his
march
to
join
livius
against
hasdrubal
he
advised
them
to
send
the
two
legions
which
formed
the
home
garrison
on
to
narnia
so
as
to
defend
that
pass
of
the
flaminian
road
against
hasdrubal
in
case
he
should
march
upon
rome
before
the
consular
armies
could
attack
him
they
were
to
supply
the
place
of
those
two
legions
at
rome
by
a
levy
en
masse
in
the
city
and
by
ordering
up
the
reserve
legion
from
capua
these
were
his
communications
to
the
senate
he
also
sent
horseman
forward
along
his
line
of
march
with
orders
to
the
local
authorities
to
bring
stores
of
provisions
and
refreshments
of
every
kind
to
the
and
to
have
relays
of
carriages
ready
for
the
conveyance
of
the
wearied
soldiers
such
were
the
precautions
which
he
took
for
accelerating
his
march
and
when
he
had
advanced
some
little
distance
from
his
camp
he
briefly
informed
his
soldiers
of
the
real
object
of
their
expedition
he
told
them
that
there
never
was
a
design
more
seemingly
audacious
and
more
really
safe
he
said
he
was
leading
them
to
a
certain
victory

his
colleague

an
army
large
enough
to
balance
the
enemy
already
so
that
their
swords
would
decisively
turn
the
scale
the
very
rumour
that
a
fresh
consul
and
a
fresh
army
had
come
up
when
heard
on
the
and
he
would
take
care
that
they
should
not
be
heard
of
before
they
were
seen
and
felt
would
settle
the
campaign
they
would
have
all
the
credit
of
the
victory
and
of
having
dealt
the
final
decisive
blow
he
appealed
to
the
enthusiastic
reception
which
they
already
met
with
on
their
line
of
march
as
a
proof
and
an
omen
of
their
good

reasoned
on
the
perilous
state
in

nero
had
left
the

of
his
army
without
a
general
and
deprived
of
the
core
of
its
strength

the

of
the
terrible
hannibal
they
speculated
on
how
long
it
would
take
hannibal
to
pursue
and
overtake
nero
himself
and
his
expeditionary
force
they
talked
over
the
former
disasters
of
the
war
and
the
fall
of
both
the
consuls
of
the
last
year
all
these
calamities
had
come
on
them
while
they
had
only
one
carthaginian

with

they
had
two
punic

sprung
from
the

trained
up
in
the

hostility
to

equally
practised
in
battle
against
its
legions

if
the
comparative
speed
and
success
with
which
he
had
crossed
the
alps
was
a
fair
test
he
was
even
a
better
general
than
his
brother
with
fear
for
their
interpreter

rumour
they
exaggerated
the
strength
of
their

in
every
quarter

criticised

distrusted

was

about

had
sent

forward
to
apprise
his

of
his
project

of
his
approach
and
by
the
advice
of
livius

so
timed
his
final
march
as
to
reach
the

to
a
previous
arrangement
nero

were
received
silently
into

each
according

by
these

there
was
no
enlargement
of
the
camp
that
could
betray
to
hasdrubal
the
accession
of
force
which
the
romans
had
received
this
was
considerable
as
numbers
had
been
increased
on
the
march
by
the
volunteers
who
offered
themselves
in
crowds
and
from
whom
he
selected
the
most
promising
men
and
especially
the
veterans
of
former
campaigns
a
council
of
war
was
held
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
in
which
some
advised
that
time
should
be
given
for
nero
men
to
refresh
themselves
after
the
fatigue
of
such
a
march
but
nero
vehemently
opposed

for

both
the

and

must
destroy

must
be
back
in

nero
advice
prevailed
it
was
resolved
to
fight
directly
and
before
the
consuls
and
praetor
left
the
tent
of
livius
the
red
ensign
which
was
the
signal
to
prepare
for
immediate
action
was
hoisted
and
the
romans
forthwith
drew
up
in
battle
array
outside
the
camp
hasdrubal
had
been
anxious
to
bring
livius
and
porcius
to
battle
though
he
had
not
judged
it
expedient
to
attack
them
in
their
lines
and
now
on
hearing
that
the
romans
offered
battle
he
also
drew
up
his
men
and
advanced
towards
them
no
spy
or
deserter
had
informed
him
of
arrival
nor
had
he
received
any
direct
information
that
he
had
more
than
his
old
enemies
to
deal
with
but
as
he
rode
forward
to
reconnoitre
the
roman
lines
he
thought
that
their
numbers
seemed
to
have
increased
and
that
the
armour
of
them
was
unusually
dull
and
stained
he
noticed
also
that
the
horses
of
some
of
the
cavalry
appeared
to
be
rough
and
out
of
condition
as
if
they
had
just
come
from
a
succession
of
forced
marches
so
also
though
owing
to
the
precaution
of
livius
the
roman
camp
showed
no
change
of
size
it
had
not
escaped
the
quick
ear
of
the
carthaginian
general
that
the
trumpet
which
gave
the
signal
to
the
roman
legions
sounded
that
morning
once
oftener
than
usual
as
if
directing
the
troops
of
some
additional
superior
officer
hasdrubal
from
his
spanish
campaigns
was
well
acquainted
with
all
the
sounds
and
signals
of
roman
war
and
from
all
that
he
heard
and
saw
he
felt
convinced
that
both
the
roman
consuls
were
before
him
in
doubt
and
difficulty
as
to
what
might
have
taken
place
between
the
armies
of
the
south
and
probably
hoping
that
hannibal
also
was
approaching
hasdrubal
determined
to
avoid
an
encounter
with
the
combined
roman
forces
and
to
endeavour
to
retreat
upon
insubrian
gaul
where
he
would
be
in
a
friendly
country
and
could
endeavour
to
his
communications
with
his
brother
he
therefore
led
his
troops
back
into
their
camp
and
as
the
romans
did
not
venture
on
an
assault
upon
his
entrenchments
and
hasdrubal
did
not
choose
to
commence
his
retreat
in
their
sight
the
day
passed
away
in
inaction
at
the
first
watch
of
the
night
hasdrubal
led
his
men
silently
out
of
their
camp
and
moved
northwards
towards
the
metaurus
in
the
hope
of
placing
that
river
between
himself
and
the
romans
before
his
retreat
was
discovered
his
guides
betrayed
him
and
having
purposely
led
him
away
from
the
part
of
the
river
that
was
fordable
they
made
their
escape
in
the
dark
and
left
hasdrubal
and
his
army
wandering
in
confusion
along
the
steep
bank
and
seeking
in
vain
for
a
spot
where
the
stream
could
be
safely
crossed
at
last
they
halted
and
when
day
dawned
on
them
hasdrubal
found
that
great
numbers
of
his
men
in
their
fatigue
and
impatience
had
lost
all
discipline
and
subordination
and
that
many
of
his
gallic
auxiliaries
had
got
drunk
and
were
lying
helpless
in
their
quarters
the
roman
cavalry
was
soon
seen
coming
up
in
pursuit
followed
at
no
great
distance
by
the
legions
which
marched
in
readiness
for
an
instant
engagement
it
was
hopeless
for
hasdrubal
to
think
of
continuing
his
retreat
before
them
the
prospect
of
immediate
battle
might
recall
the
disordered
part
of
his
troops
to
a
sense
of
duty
and
revive
the
instinct
of
discipline
he
therefore
ordered
his
men
to
prepare
for
action
instantly
and
made
the
best
arrangement
of
them
that
the
nature
of
the
ground
would
permit
heeren
has
well
described
the
general
appearance
of
a
carthaginian
army
he
says
it
was
an
assemblage
of
the
most
opposite
races
of
the
human
species
from
the
farthest
parts
of
the
globe
hordes
of
gauls
were
ranged
next
to
companies
of
white
clothed
iberians
and
savage
ligurians
next
to
the
nasamones
and
lotophagi
carthaginians
and
formed
the
centre
while
innumerable
troops
of
numidian
taken
from
all
the
tribes
of
the
desert
swarmed
about
on
unsaddled
horses
and
formed
the
wings
the
van
was
composed
of
balearic
slingers
and
a
line
of
colossal
elephants
with
their
ethiopian
guides
formed
as
it
were
a
chain
of
moving
fortresses
before
the
whole
army
such
were
the
usual
materials
and
arrangements
of
the
hosts
that
fought
for
carthage
but
the
troops
under
hasdrubal
were
not
in
all
respects
thus
constituted
or
thus
stationed
he
seems
to
have
been
especially
deficient
in
cavalry
and
he
had
few
african
troops
though
some
carthaginians
of
high
rank
were
with
him
his
veteran
spanish
infantry
armed
with
helmets
and
shields
and
short
swords
were
the
best
part
of
his
army
these
and
his
few
africans
he
drew
up
on
his
right
wing
under
his
own
personal
command
in
the
centre
he
placed
his
ligurian
infantry
and
on
the
left
wing
he
placed
or
retained
the
gauls
who
were
armed
with
long
javelins
and
with
huge
broadswords
and
targets
the
rugged
nature
of
the
ground
in
front
and
on
the
flank
of
this
part
of
his
line
made
him
hope
that
the
roman
right
wing
would
be
unable
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
these
unserviceable
barbarians
before
he
could
make
some
impression
with
his
spanish
veterans
on
the
roman
left
this
was
the
only
chance
that
he
had
of
victory
or
safety
and
he
seems
to
have
done
everything
that
good
generalship
could
do
to
secure
it
he
placed
his
elephants
in
advance
of
his
centre
and
right
wing
he
had
caused
the
driver
of
each
of
them
to
be
provided
with
a
sharp
iron
spike
and
a
mallet
and
had
given
orders
that
every
beast
that
became
unmanageable
and
ran
back
upon
his
own
ranks
should
be
instantly
killed
by
driving
the
spike
into
the
vertebra
at
the
junction
of
the
head
and
the
spine
elephants
were
ten
in
number
we
have
no
trustworthy
information
as
to
the
amount
of
his
infantry
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
he
was
greatly
outnumbered
by
the
combined
roman
forces
the
tactic
of
the
roman
legions
had
not
yet
acquired
the
perfection
which
it
received
from
the
military
genius
of
marius
most
probably
during
the
period
of
his
prolonged
consulship
from
to
while
he
was
training
his
army
against
the
cimbri
and
the
teutons
and
which
we
read
of
in
the
first
chapter
of
gibbon
we
possess
in
that
great
work
an
account
of
the
roman
legions
at
the
end
of
the
commonwealth
and
during
the
early
ages
of
the
empire
which
those
alone
can
adequately
admire
who
have
attempted
a
similar
description
we
have
also
in
the
sixth
and
seventeenth
books
of
polybius
an
elaborate
discussion
on
the
military
system
of
the
romans
in
his
time
which
was
not
far
distant
from
the
time
of
the
battle
of
the
metaurus
but
the
subject
is
beset
with
difficulties
and
instead
of
entering
into
minute
but
inconclusive
details
i
would
refer
to
gibbon
first
chapter
as
serving
for
a
general
description
of
the
roman
army
in
its
period
of
perfection
and
remark
that
the
training
and
armour
which
the
whole
legion
received
in
the
time
of
augustus
was
two
centuries
earlier
only
partially
introduced
two
divisions
of
troops
called
hastati
and
principes
formed
the
bulk
of
each
roman
legion
in
the
second
punic
war
each
of
these
divisions
was
twelve
hundred
strong
the
hastatus
and
the
princeps
legionary
bore
a
or
coat
of
mail
brazen
greaves
and
a
brazen
helmet
with
a
lofty
upright
crest
of
scarlet
or
black
feathers
he
had
a
large
oblong
shield
and
as
weapons
of
offence
two
javelins
one
of
which
was
light
and
slender
but
the
other
was
a
strong
and
massive
weapon
with
a
shaft
about
four
feet
long
and
an
iron
head
of
equal
length
the
sword
was
carried
on
the
right
thigh
and
was
a
short
thrust
weapon
like
that
which
was
used
by
the
spaniards
thus
armed
the
hastati
formed
the
front
division
of
the
legion
and
the
principes
the
second
each
division
was
drawn
up
about
ten
deep
a
space
of
three
feet
being
allowed
between
the
files
as
well
as
the
ranks
so
as
to
give
each
legionary
ample
room
for
the
use
of
his
javelins
and
of
his
sword
and
shield
the
men
in
the
second
rank
did
not
stand
immediately
behind
those
in
the
first
rank
but
the
files
were
alternate
like
the
position
of
the
men
on
a
draught
board
this
was
termed
the
quincunx
order
niebuhr
considers
that
this
arrangement
enabled
the
legion
to
keep
up
a
shower
of
javelins
on
the
enemy
for
some
considerable
time
he
says
when
the
first
line
had
hurled
its
pila
it
probably
stepped
back
between
those
who
stood
behind
it
who
with
two
steps
forward
restored
the
front
nearly
to
its
first
position
a
movement
which
on
account
of
the
arrangement
of
the
quincunx
could
be
executed
without
losing
a
moment
thus
one
line
succeeded
the
other
in
the
front
till
it
was
time
to
draw
the
swords
nay
when
it
was
found
expedient
the
lines
which
had
already
been
in
the
front
might
repeat
this
change
since
the
stores
of
pila
were
surely
not
confined
to
the
two
which
each
soldier
took
with
him
into
battle
the
same
change
must
have
taken
place
in
fighting
with
the
sword
which
when
the
same
tactic
was
adopted
on
both
sides
was
anything
but
a
confused
melee
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
series
of
single
combats
he
adds
that
a
military
man
of
experience
had
been
consulted
by
him
on
the
subject
and
had
given
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
change
of
the
lines
as
described
above
was
by
no
means
impracticable
and
in
the
absence
of
the
deafening
noise
of
gunpowder
it
can
not
have
had
even
any
difficulty
with
trained
troops
the
third
division
of
the
legion
was
six
hundred
strong
and
acted
as
a
reserve
it
was
always
composed
of
veteran
soldiers
who
were
called
the
triarii
their
arms
were
the
same
as
those
of
the
principes
and
hastati
except
that
each
triarian
carried
a
spear
instead
of
javelins
the
rest
of
the
legion
consisted
of
light
armed
troops
who
acted
as
skirmishers
the
cavalry
of
each
legion
was
at
this
period
about
three
hundred
strong
the
italian
allies
who
were
attached
to
the
legion
seem
to
have
been
similarly
armed
and
equipped
but
their
numerical
proportion
of
cavalry
was
much
larger
such
was
the
nature
of
the
forces
that
advanced
on
the
roman
side
to
the
battle
of
the
metaurus
nero
commanded
the
right
wing
livius
the
left
and
the
praetor
porcius
had
the
command
of
the
centre
both
romans
and
carthaginians
well
understood
how
much
depended
upon
the
fortune
of
this
day
and
how
little
hope
of
safety
there
was
for
the
vanquished
only
the
romans
herein
seemed
to
have
had
the
better
in
conceit
and
opinion
that
they
were
to
fight
with
men
desirous
to
have
fled
from
them
and
according
to
this
presumption
came
livius
the
consul
with
a
proud
bravery
to
give
charge
on
the
spaniards
and
africans
by
whom
he
was
so
sharply
entertained
that
victory
seemed
very
doubtful
the
africans
and
spaniards
were
stout
soldiers
and
well
acquainted
with
the
manner
of
the
roman
fight
the
ligurians
also
were
a
hardy
nation
and
not
accustomed
to
give
ground
which
they
needed
the
less
or
were
able
now
to
do
being
placed
in
the
midst
livius
therefore
and
porcius
found
great
opposition
and
with
great
slaughter
on
both
sides
prevailed
little
or
nothing
besides
other
difficulties
they
were
exceedingly
troubled
by
the
elephants
that
brake
their
first
ranks
and
put
them
in
such
disorder
as
the
roman
ensigns
were
driven
to
fall
back
all
this
while
claudius
nero
labouring
in
vain
against
a
steep
hill
was
unable
to
come
to
blows
with
the
gauls
that
stood
opposite
him
but
out
of
danger
this
made
hasdrubal
the
more
confident
who
seeing
his
own
left
wing
safe
did
the
more
boldly
and
fiercely
make
impression
on
the
other
side
upon
the
left
wing
of
the
romans
historie
of
the
world
by
sir
walter
raleigh
p
but
at
last
nero
who
found
that
hasdrubal
refused
his
left
wing
and
who
could
not
overcome
the
difficulties
of
the
ground
in
the
quarter
assigned
to
him
decided
the
battle
by
another
stroke
of
that
military
genius
which
had
inspired
his
march
wheeling
a
brigade
of
his
best
men
round
the
rear
of
the
rest
of
the
roman
army
nero
fiercely
charged
the
flank
of
the
spaniards
and
africans
the
charge
was
as
successful
as
it
was
sudden
rolled
back
in
disorder
upon
each
other
and
overwhelmed
by
numbers
the
spaniards
and
ligurians
died
fighting
gallantly
to
the
last
the
gauls
who
had
taken
little
or
no
part
in
the
strife
of
the
day
were
then
surrounded
and
butchered
almost
without
resistance
hasdrubal
after
having
by
the
confession
of
his
enemies
done
all
that
a
general
could
do
when
he
saw
that
the
victory
was
irreparably
lost
scorning
to
survive
the
gallant
host
which
he
had
led
and
to
gratify
as
a
captive
roman
cruelty
and
pride
spurred
his
horse
into
the
midst
of
a
roman
cohort
where
sword
in
hand
he
met
the
death
that
was
worthy
of
the
son
of
hamilcar
and
the
brother
of
hannibal
success
the
most
complete
had
crowned
nero
enterprise
returning
as
rapidly
as
he
had
advanced
he
was
again
facing
the
inactive
enemies
in
the
south
before
they
even
knew
of
his
march
but
he
brought
with
him
a
ghastly
trophy
of
what
he
had
done
in
the
true
spirit
of
that
savage
brutality
which
deformed
the
roman
national
character
nero
ordered
hasdrubal
head
to
be
flung
into
his
brother
camp
eleven
years
had
passed
since
hannibal
had
last
gazed
on
those
features
the
sons
of
hamilcar
had
then
planned
their
system
of
warfare
against
rome
which
they
had
so
nearly
brought
to
successful
accomplishment
year
after
year
had
hannibal
been
struggling
in
italy
in
the
hope
of
one
day
hailing
the
arrival
of
him
whom
he
had
left
in
spain
and
of
seeing
his
brother
eye
flash
with
affection
and
pride
at
the
junction
of
their
irresistible
hosts
he
now
saw
that
eye
glazed
in
death
and
in
the
agony
of
his
heart
the
great
carthaginian
groaned
aloud
that
he
recognised
his
country
destiny

was
almost
delirious
with
joy
see
the
splendid
description
in

sec
so
agonising
had
been
the
suspense
with
which
the
battle
verdict
on
that
great
issue
of
a
nation
life
and
death
had
been
awaited
so
overpowering
was
the
sudden
reaction
to
the
consciousness
of
security
and
to
the
full
glow
of
glory
and
success
from
the
time
when
it
had
been
known
at
rome
that
the
armies
were
in
presence
of
each
other
the
people
had
never
ceased
to
throng
the
forum
the
conscript
fathers
had
been
in
permanent
sitting
at
the
senate
house
ever
and
anon
a
fearful
whisper
crept
among
the
crowd
of
a
second
cannae
won
by
a
second
hannibal
then
came
truer
rumours
that
the
day
was
rome
but
the
people
were
sick
at
heart
and
heeded
them
not
the
shrines
were
thronged
with
trembling
women
who
seemed
to
weary
heaven
with
prayers
to
shield
them
from
the
brutal
gaul
and
the
savage
african
presently
the
reports
of
good
fortune
assumed
a
more
definite
form
it
was
said
that
two
narnian
horseman
had
ridden
from
the
east
into
the
roman
camp
of
observation
in
umbria
and
had
brought
tidings
of
the
utter
slaughter
of
the
foe
such
news
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
men
tortured
their
neighbours
and
themselves
by
demonstrating
its
improbability
and
by
ingeniously
criticising
its
evidence
soon
however
a
letter
came
from
lucius
manlius
acidinus
who
commanded
in
umbria
and
who
announced
the
arrival
of
the
narnian
horsemen
in
his
camp
and
the
intelligence
which
they
brought
thither
the
letter
was
first
laid
before
the
senate
and
then
before
the
assembly
of
the
people
the
excitement
grew
more
and
more
vehement
the
letter
was
read
and
aloud
to
thousands
it
confirmed
the
previous
rumour
but
even
this
was
insufficient
to
allay
the
feverish
anxiety
that
thrilled
through
every
breast
in
rome
the
letter
might
be
a
forgery
the
narnian
horseman
might
be
traitors
or
impostors
we
must
see
officers
from
the
army
that
fought
or
hear
despatches
from
the
consuls
themselves
and
then
only
will
we
believe
such
was
the
public
sentiment
though
some
of
more
hopeful
nature
already
permitted
themselves
a
foretaste
of
joy
at
length
came
news
that
officers
who
really
had
been
in
the
battle
were
near
at
hand
forthwith
the
whole
city
poured
forth
to
meet
them
each
person
coveting
to
be
the
first
to
receive
with
his
own
eyes
and
ears
convincing
proofs
of
the
reality
of
such
a
deliverance
one
vast
throng
of
human
beings
filled
the
road
from
rome
to
the
milvian
bridge
the
three
officers
lucius
veturius
pollio
publius
licinius
vasus
and
quintus
caecilius
metellus
came
riding
on
making
their
way
slowly
through
the
living
sea
around
them
as
they
advanced
each
told
the
successive
waves
of
eager
questioners
that
rome
was
victorious
we
have
destroyed
hasdrubal
and
his
army
our
legions
are
safe
and
our
consuls
are
unhurt
each
happy
listener
who
caught
the
welcome
sounds
from
their
lips
retired
to
communicate
his
own
joy
to
others
and
became
himself
the
centre
of
an
anxious
and
inquiring
group
when
the
officers
had
with
much
difficulty
reached
the
senate
house
and
the
crowd
was
with
still
greater
difficulty
put
back
from
entering
and
mingling
with
the
conscript
fathers
the
despatches
of
livius
and
nero
were
produced
and
read
aloud
from
the
senate
house
the
officers
proceeded
to
the
public
assembly
where
the
despatches
were
read
again
and
then
the
senior
officer
lucius
veturius
gave
in
his
own
words
a
fuller
detail
of
how
went
the
fight
when
he
had
done
speaking
to
the
people
an
universal
shout
of
rapture
rent
the
air
the
vast
assembly
then
separated
some
hastening
to
the
temples
to
find
in
devotion
a
vent
for
the
overflowing
excitement
of
their
hearts
others
seeking
their
homes
to
gladden
their
wives
and
children
with
the
good
news
and
to
feast
their
own
eyes
with
the
sight
of
the
loved
ones
who
now
at
last
were
safe
from
outrage
and
slaughter
the
senate
ordained
a
thanksgiving
of
three
days
for
the
great
deliverance
which
had
been
vouchsafed
to
rome
and
throughout
that
period
the
temples
were
incessantly
crowded
with
exulting
worshippers
and
the
matrons
with
their
children
round
them
in
their
gayest
attire
and
with
joyous
aspects
and
voices
offered
grateful
praises
to
the
immortal
gods
as
if
all
apprehension
of
evil
were
over
and
the
war
were
already
ended
with
the
revival
of
confidence
came
also
the
revival
of
activity
in
traffic
and
commerce
and
in
all
the
busy
intercourse
of
daily
life
a
numbing
load
was
taken
off
each
heart
and
brain
and
once
more
men
bought
and
sold
and
formed
their
plans
fleely
as
had
been
done
before
the
dire
carthaginians
came
into
italy
hannibal
was
certainly
still
in
the
land
but
all
felt
that
his
power
to
destroy
was
broken
and
that
the
crisis
of
the
was
past
the
metaurus
indeed
had
not
only
determined
the
event
of
the
strife
between
rome
and
carthage
but
it
had
ensured
to
rome
two
centuries
more
of
almost
unchanged
conquest
hannibal
did
actually
with
almost
superhuman
skill
retain
his
hold
on
southern
italy
for
a
few
years
longer
but
the
imperial
city
and
her
allies
were
no
longer
in
danger
from
his
arms
and
after
downfall
the
great
military
republic
of
the
ancient
world
met
in
her
career
of
conquest
no
other
worthy
competitor
byron

termed
march
unequalled
and
in
the
magnitude
of
its
consequences
it
is
so
viewed
only
as
a
military
exploit
it
remains
unparalleled

by

obstinacy
began
in
the
year
six
years
after
the
total
expulsion
of
the
carthaginians
from
their
country
it
was
exceedingly
obstinate
partly
from
the
natural
state
of
the
country
which
was
thickly
populated
and
where
every
place
became
a
fortress
partly
from
the
courage
of
the
inhabitants
but
at
last
all
owing
to
the
peculiar
policy
of
the
romans
who
yielded
to
employ
their
allies
to
subdue
other
nations
this
war
continued
almost
without
interruption
from

to

was
for
the
most
part
carried
on
at
the

time
in

the
celtiberi
were
the
most
formidable
adversaries

in

were
equally
powerful

pitch

reduced

to

tranquillity
in
when
the
celtiberi
were
attacked
in
their
native
territory
and
when
the
romans
in
both
provinces
were
so
often
beaten
that
nothing
was
more
dreaded
by
the
soldiers
at
home
than
to
be
sent

the
war
however
soon
extended
itself
to
hispania
citerior
where
many
nations
particularly
the
numantines
took
up
arms
against
rome
viriathus
sometimes
victorious
and
sometimes
defeated
was
never
more
formidable
than
in
the
moment
of
defeat
because
he
knew
how
to
take
advantage
of
his
knowledge
of
the
country
and
of
the
dispositions
of
his
countrymen
after
his
murder
caused
by
the
treachery
of
saepio
lusitania
was
subdued
but
the
numantine
war
became
still
more
violent
and
the
numantines
compelled
the
consul

to
a
disadvantageous
treaty
when

in
the
year

the

however
dreadful
was

it
was
not
to
unite

to

to
enervate
to
loosen

to
scatter

that
the

were
allowed
to
conquer
the

were
then
themselves
reduced
to
deep
submission

its
failure
a
step
gained
nearer
to

evil
that
prevailed
while
every
bad
achievement
that
may
seem
to
us
to
have
succeeded
temporarily

with

was
equally
by

the

the

it

alike
in

the

not
have
been
so
apparent
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
must
not
seem
at
the
last
that
the
disposition
of
the
romans
or
of
mankind
to
submission
was
secured
solely
through
the
errors
and
the
apparently
ineffectual
toils
which
we
have
traced
back
to
these
times
of
old

been
wasted

to

all
were
overshadowed
by
passing
wrongs

gleam
as

in
anticipation

in

the

it

been

by

of
conflict
and
loss
that
no
lasting

no

truth
could
be
procured

of
mankind

the

nor
was

wanting
in

in

the

had
fruitlessly
struggled
for
eight
years
against
caesar
and
the
valiant
vercingetorix
who
in
the
last
year
of

had
roused
all
his
countrymen
to
insurrection
who
had
cut
off

detachments
and
brought
caesar
himself
to
the
extreme
of
peril
at

he
too

finally
succumbed

been

had
then
been
butchered
in

in

roman
dungeon
it
was
true
that
rome
was
no
longer
the
great
military
republic
which
for
so
many
ages
had
shattered
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
her
system
of
government
was
changed
and
after
a
century
of
revolution
and
civil
war
she
had
placed
herself
under
the
despotism
of
a
single
ruler
but
the
discipline
of
her
troops
was
yet
unimpaired
and
her
warlike
spirit
seemed
unabated
the
first
wars
of
the
empire
had
been
signalised
by
conquests
as
valuable
as
any
gained
by
the
republic
in
a
corresponding
period
it
is
a
great
fallacy
though
apparently
sanctioned
by
great
authorities
to
suppose
that
the
foreign
policy
pursued
by
augustus
was
pacific
he
certainly
recommended
such
a
policy
to
his
successors

from
timidity

from
jealousy

their
fame
outshining

he
himself

unceasing

still
more
in
her
long
series
of
desolating

the

almost
wholly
disappeared
above

the

thought
of

the
respect
there
shown
to
the

of
the
pure
affection
by
which
that
respect
was

his
soul
must
have
burned
within
him
at
the
contemplation
of
such
a
race
yielding
to

debased
italians
still
to
persuade
the
germans
to
combine
in
spite
of
their
frequent
feuds
among
themselves
in
one
sudden
outbreak
against
rome
to
keep
the
scheme
concealed
from
the
romans
until
the
hour
for
action
had
arrived
and
then
without
possessing
a
single
walled
town
without
military
stores
without
training
to
teach
his
insurgent
countrymen
to
defeat
veteran
armies
and
storm
fortifications
seemed
so
perilous
an
enterprise
that
probably
arminius
would
have
receded
from
it
had
not
a
stronger
feeling
even
than
patriotism
urged
him
on
among
the
germans
of
high
rank
who
had
most
readily
submitted
to
the
invaders
and

zealous
partisans
of

authority
was
a
chieftain
named
segestes
his
daughter
thusnelda
was
among
the
noble
maidens
of
germany
arminius
had
sought
her
hand
in
marriage
but
segestes
who
probably
discerned
the
young
chief
disaffection
to
rome
forbade
his
suit
and
strove
to
preclude
all
communication
between
him
and
his
daughter
thusnelda
however
sympathised
far
more
with
the
heroic
spirit
of
her
lover
than
with
the
time
serving
policy
of
her
father
an
elopement
baffled
the
precautions
of
segestes
who
disappointed
in
his
hope
of
preventing
the
marriage
accused
arminius
before
the
roman
governor
of
having
carried
off
his
daughter
and
of
planning
treason
against
rome
thus
assailed
and
dreading
to
see
his
bride
torn
from
him
by
the
officials
of
the
foreign
oppressor
arminius
delayed
no
longer
but
bent
all
his
energies
to
organize
and
execute
a
general
insurrection
of
the
great
mass
of
his
countrymen
who
hitherto
had
submitted
in
sullen
inertness
to
the
roman
dominion
a
change
of
governors
had
recently
taken
place
which
while
it
materially
favoured
the
ultimate
success
of
the
insurgents
served
by
the
immediate
aggravation
of
the
roman
oppressions
which
it
produced
to
make
the
native
population
more
universally
eager
to
take
arms
tiberius
who
was
afterwards
emperor
had
lately
been
recalled
from
the
command
in
germany
and
sent
into
pannonia
to
put
down
a
dangerous
revolt
which
had
broken
out
against
the
romans
in
that
province
the
german
patriots
were
thus
delivered
from
the
stern
supervision
of
one
of
the
most
auspicious
of
mankind
and
were
also
relieved
from
having
to
contend
against
the
high
military
talents
of
a
veteran
commander
who
thoroughly
understood
their
national
character
and
the
nature
of
the
country
which
he
himself
had
principally
subdued
in
the
room
of
tiberius
augustus
sent
into
germany
quintilius
varus
who
had
lately
returned
from
the
proconsulate
of
syria
varus
was
a
true
representative
of
the
higher
classes
of
the
romans
among
whom
a
general
taste
for
literature
a
keen
susceptibility
to
all
intellectual
gratifications
a
minute
acquaintance
with
the
principles
and
practice
of
their
own
national
jurisprudence
a
careful
training
in
the
schools
of
the
rhetoricians
and
a
fondness
for
either
partaking
in
or
watching
the
intellectual
strife
of
forensic
oratory
had
become
generally
diffused
without
however
having
humanized
the
old
roman
spirit
of
cruel
indifference
for
human
feelings
and
human
sufferings
and
without
acting
as
the
least
check
on
unprincipled
avarice
and
ambition
or
on
habitual
and
gross
profligacy
accustomed
to
govern
the
depraved
and
debased
natives
of
syria
a
country
where
courage
in
man
and
virtue
in
woman
had
for
centuries
been
unknown
varus
thought
that
he
might
gratify
his
licentious
and
rapacious
passions
with
equal
impunity
among
the
sons
and
daughters
of
germany
when
the
general
of
an
army
sets
the
example
of
outrages
of
this
description
he
is
soon
faithfully
imitated
by
his
officers
and
surpassed
by
his
still
more
brutal
soldiery
the
romans
now
habitually
indulged
in
those
violations
of
the
sanctity
of
the
domestic
shrine
and
those
insults
upon
honour
and
modesty
by
which
far
less
gallant
spirits
than
those
of
our
teutonic
ancestors
have
often
been
maddened
into
insurrection
i
can
not
forbear
quoting
macaulay
beautiful
lines
where
he
describes
how
similar
outrages
in
the
early
times
of
rome
goaded
the
plebeians
to
rise
against
the
patricians
heap
heavier
still
the
fetters
bar
closer
still
the
grate
patient
as

we
yield
us
up
unto
your
cruel
hate
but
by
the
shades
beneath
us
and
by
the
gods
above
add
not
unto
your
cruel
hate
your
still
more
cruel
love
then
leave
the
poor
plebeian
his
single
tie
to
life
the
sweet
sweet
love
of
daughter
of
sister
and
of
wife
the
gentle
speech
the
balm
for
all
that
his
vext
soul
endures
the
kiss
in
which
he
half
forgets
even
such
a
yoke
as
yours
still
let
the
maiden
beauty
swell
the
father
breast
with
pride
still
let
the
bridegroom
arms
enfold
an
unpolluted
bride
spare
us
the
inexpiable
wrong
the
unutterable
shame
that
turns
the
coward
heart
to
steel
the
sluggard
blood
to
flame
lest
when
our
latest
hope
is
fled
ye
taste
of
our
despair
and
learn
by
proof
in
some
wild
hour
how
much
the
wretched
dare
arminius
found
among
the
other
german
chiefs
many
who
sympathised
with
him
in
his
indignation
at
their
country
debasement
and
many
whom
private
wrongs
had
stung
yet
more
deeply
there
was
little
difficulty
in
collecting
bold
leaders
for
an
attack
on
the
oppressors
and
little
fear
of
the
population
not
rising
readily
at
those
leaders
call
but
to
declare
open
war
against
rome
and
to
encounter
varus
army
in
a
pitched
battle
would
have
been
merely
rushing
upon
certain
destruction
varus
had
three
legions
under
him
a
force
which
after
allowing
for
detachments
can
not
be
estimated
at
less
than
fourteen
thousand
roman
infantry
he
had
also
eight
or
nine
hundred
roman
cavalry
and
at
least
an
equal
number
of
horse
and
foot
sent
from
the
allied
states
or
raised
among
those
provincials
who
had
not
received
the
roman
franchise
it
was
not
merely
the
number
but
the
quality
of
this
force
that
made
it
formidable
and
however
contemptible
varus
might
be
as
a
general
arminius
well
knew
how
admirably
the
roman
armies
were
organized
and
officered
and
how
perfectly
the
legionaries
understood
every
manoeuvre
and
every
duty
which
the
varying
emergencies
of
a
stricken
field
might
require
stratagem
was
therefore
indispensable
and
it
was
necessary
to
blind
varus
to
his
schemes
until
a
favourable
opportunity
should
arrive
for
striking
a
decisive
blow
for
this
purpose
the
german
confederates
frequented
the
headquarters
of
varus
which
seem
to
have
been
near
the
centre
of
the
modern
country
of
westphalia
where
the
roman
general
conducted
himself
with
all
the
arrogant
security
of
the
governor
of
a
perfectly
submissive
province
there
varus
gratified
at
once
his
vanity
his
rhetorical
taste
and
his
avarice
by
holding
courts
to
which
he
summoned
the
germans
for
the
settlement
of
all
their
disputes
while
a
bar
of
roman
advocates
attended
to
argue
the
cases
before
the
tribunal
of
the
proconsul
who
did
not
omit
the
opportunity
of
exacting
and
accepting
bribes
varus
trusted
implicitly
to
the
respect
which
the
germans
pretended
to
pay
to
his
abilities
as
a
judge
and
to
the
interest
which
they
affected
to
take
in
the
forensic
eloquence
of
their
conquerors
meanwhile
a
succession
of
heavy
rains
rendered
the
country
more
difficult
for
the
operations
of
regular
troops
and
arminius
seeing
that
the
infatuation
of
varus
was
complete
secretly
directed
the
tribes
near
the
weser
and
the
ems
to
take
up
arms
in
open
revolt
against
the
romans
this
was
represented
to
varus
as
an
occasion
which
required
his
prompt
attendance
at
the
spot
but
he
was
kept
in
studied
ignorance
of
its
being
part
of
a
concerted
national
rising
and
he
still
looked
on
arminius
as
his
submissive
vassal
whose
aid
he
might
rely
on
in
facilitating
the
march
of
his
troops
against
the
rebels
and
in
extinguishing
the
local
disturbance
he
therefore
set
his
army
in
motion
and
marched
eastward
in
a
line
parallel
to
the
course
of
the
lippe
for
some
distance
his
route
lay
along
a
level
plain
but
on
arriving
at
the
tract
between
the
curve
of
the
upper
part
of
that
stream
and
the
sources
of
the
ems
the
country
assumes
a
very
different
character
and
here
in
the
territory
of
the
modern
little
principality
of
lippe
it
was
that
arminius
had
fixed
the
scene
of
his
enterprise
a
woody
and
hilly
region
intervenes
between
the
heads
of
the
two
rivers
and
forms
the
of
their
streams
this
region
still
retains
the
name
teutoberger
wald
teutobergiensis
saltus
which
it
bore
in
the
days
of
arminius
the
nature
of
the
ground
has
probably
also
remained
unaltered
the
eastern
part
of
it
round
detmoldt
the
present
capital
of
the
principality
of
lippe
is
described
by
a
modern
german
scholar
dr
plate
as
being
a
intersected
by
numerous
deep
and
narrow
valleys
which
in
some
places
form
small
plains
surrounded
by
steep
mountains
and
rocks
and
only
accessible
by
narrow
defiles
all
the
valleys
are
traversed
by
rapid
streams
shallow
in
the
dry
season
but
subject
to
sudden
swellings
in
autumn
and
winter
the
vast
forests
which
cover
the
summits
and
slopes
of
the
hills
consist
chiefly
of
oak
there
is
little
underwood
and
both
men
and
horse
would
move
with
ease
in
the
forests
if
the
ground
were
not
broken
by
gulleys
or
rendered
impracticable
by
fallen
trees
this
is
the
district
to
which
varus
is
supposed
to
have
marched
and
dr
plate
adds
that
the
names
of
several
localities
on
and
near
that
spot
seem
to
indicate
that
a
great
battle
had
once
been
fought
there
we
find
the
names
winnefeld
the
field
of
victory
knochenbahn
the
knochenleke
the
mordkessel
the
kettle
of
slaughter
and
others
i
am
indebted
for
much
valuable
information
on
this
subject
to
my
friend
henry
pearson
contrary
to
the
usual
strict
principles
of
roman
discipline
varus
had
suffered
his
army
to
be
accompanied
and
impeded
by
an
immense
train
of
and
by
a
rabble
of
camp
followers
as
if
his
troops
had
been
merely
changing
their
quarters
in
a
friendly
country
when
the
long
array
quitted
the
firm
level
ground
and
began
to
wind
its
way
among
the
woods
the
marshes
and
the
ravines
the
difficulties
of
the
march
even
without
the
intervention
of
an
armed
foe
became
fearfully
apparent
in
many
places
the
soil
sodden
with
rain
was
impracticable
for
cavalry
and
even
for
infantry
until
trees
had
been
felled
and
a
rude
causeway
formed
through
the
morass
the
duties
of
the
engineer
were
familiar
to
all
who
served
in
the
roman
armies
but
the
crowd
and
confusion
of
the
columns
embarrassed
the
working
parties
of
the
soldiery
and
in
the
midst
of
their
toil
and
disorder
the
word
was
suddenly
passed
through
their
ranks
that
the
was
attacked
by
the
barbarians
varus
resolved
on
pressing
forward
but
a
heavy
discharge
of
missiles
from
the
woods
on
either
flank
taught
him
how
serious
was
the
peril
and
he
saw
the
best
men
falling
round
him
without
the
opportunity
of
retaliation
for
his
auxiliaries
who
were
principally
of
germanic
race
now
rapidly
deserted
and
it
was
impossible
to
deploy
the
legionaries
on
such
broken
ground
for
a
charge
against
the
enemy
choosing
one
of
the
most
open
and
firm
spots
which
they
could
force
their
way
to
the
romans
halted
for
the
night
and
faithful
to
their
national
discipline
and
tactics
formed
their
camp
amid
the
harassing
attacks
of
the
rapidly
thronging
foes
with
the
elaborate
toil
and
systematic
skill
the
traces
of
which
are
impressed
permanently
on
the
soil
of
so
many
european
countries
attesting
the
presence
in
the
olden
time
of
the
imperial
eagles
on
the
morrow
the
romans
renewed
their
march
the
veteran
officers
who
served
under
varus
now
probably
directing
the
operations
and
hoping
to
find
the
germans
drawn
up
to
meet
them
in
which
case
they
relied
on
their
own
superior
discipline
and
tactics
for
such
a
victory
as
should
reassure
the
supremacy
of
rome
but
arminius
was
far
too
sage
a
commander
to
lead
on
his
followers
with
their
unwieldy
broadswords
and
inefficient
defensive
armour
against
the
roman
legionaries
fully
armed
with
helmet
cuirass
greaves
and
shield
who
were
skilled
to
commence
the
conflict
with
a
murderous
volley
of
heavy
javelins
hurled
upon
the
foe
when
a
few
yards
distant
and
then
with
their
short
swords
to
hew
their
way
through
all
opposition
preserving
the
utmost
steadiness
and
coolness
and
obeying
each
word
of
command
in
the
midst
of
strife
and
slaughter
with
the
same
precision
and
alertness
as
if
upon
parade
see
gibbon

of
the
roman
legions
in
the
time
of
augustus
and
see
the
description
in
tacitus
ann
lib
i
of
the
subsequent
battles
between
caecina
and
arminius
arminius
suffered
the
romans
to
march
out
from
their
camp
to
form
first
in
line
for
action
and
then
in
column
for
marching
without
the
show
of
opposition
for
some
distance
varus
was
allowed
to
move
on
only
harassed
by
slight
skirmishes
but
struggling
with
difficulty
through
the
broken
ground
the
toil
and
distress
of
his
men
being
aggravated
by
heavy
torrents
of
rain
which
burst
upon
the
devoted
legions
as
if
the
angry
gods
of
germany
were
pouring
out
the
vials
of
their
wrath
upon
the
invaders
after
some
little
time
their
van
approached
a
ridge
of
high
woody
ground
which
is
one
of
the
of
the
great
hercynian
forest
and
is
situate
between
the
modern
villages
of
driburg
and
bielefeld
arminius
had
caused
barricades
of
hewn
trees
to
be
formed
here
so
as
to
add
to
the
natural
difficulties
of
the
passage
fatigue
and
discouragement
now
began
to
betray
themselves
in
the
roman
ranks
their
line
became
less
steady
were
abandoned
from
the
impossibility
of
forcing
them
along
and
as
this
happened
many
soldiers
left
their
ranks
and
crowded
round
the
waggons
to
secure
the
most
valuable
portions
of
their
property
each
was
busy

the

the
fierce

of
the

pealed
through

in

they
assailed
the

pouring
in

of

on
the

legionaries
as
they
struggled
up
the
glens

floundered
in

watching

charging
through

retreat
now

the

was
in
great
affliction
for
the
troops
he
had
lost
and
for
terror
respecting
the
germans
and
the
gauls
and
his
chief
alarm
was
that
he
expected
them
to
push
on
against
italy
and
rome
and
there
remained
no
roman
youth
fit
for
military
duty
that
were
worth
speaking
of

the
allied
populations
that
were
at
all
serviceable
had
been
wasted
away
yet
he
prepared
for
the
emergency
as
well
as
his
means
allowed
and
when
none
of
the
citizens
of
military
age
were
willing
to
enlist
he
made
them
cast
lots
and
punished
by
confiscation
of

and
disfranchisement
every

not

mentions
also
a
number
of
terrific
portents
that
were
believed
to
have
occurred
at
the
time
and
the
narration
of
which
is
not
immaterial
as
it
shows
the
state
of
the
public
mind
when
such
things
were
so
believed
in
and
so
interpreted
the
summits
of

of
its
own
accord
turned

and
now
pointed
to
italy
these
and
other
prodigies
were
believed
by
the
multitude
to
accompany
the
slaughter
of
varus
legions
and
to
manifest
the
anger
of
the
gods
against
rome
augustus
himself
was
not
free
from
superstition
but
on
this
occasion
no
supernatural
terrors
were
needed
to
increase
the
alarm
and
grief
that
he
felt

which
made

his

suetonius

indeed
every
ancient
writer
who
alludes
to
the
overthrow
of

attests
the
importance
of
the
blow
against
the
roman
power
and
the
bitterness
with
which
it
was
felt

its

germans
did
not
pursue
their
victory
beyond
their
own
territory
but
that
victory
secured
at
once
and
for
ever
the
independence
of
the
teutonic
race
rome
sent
indeed
her
legions
again
into
germany
to
parade
a
temporary
superiority
but
all
hopes
of
permanent
conquest
were
abandoned
by
augustus
and
his
successors
the
blow
which
arminius
had
struck
never
was
forgotten
roman
fear
disguised
itself
under
the
specious
title
of
moderation
and
the
rhine
became
the
acknowledged
boundary
of
the
two
nations
until
the
fifth
century
of
our
era
when
the
germans
became
the
assailants
and
carved
with
their
conquering
swords
the
provinces
of
imperial
rome
into
the
kingdoms
of
modern
europe
arminius
i
have
said
above
that
the
great
cheruscan
is
more
truly
one
of
our
national
heroes
than
caractacus
is
it
may
be
added
that
an
englishman
is
entitled
to
claim
a
closer
degree
of
relationship
with
arminius
than
can
be
claimed
by
any
german
of
modern
germany
the
proof
of
this
depends
on
the
proof
of
four
facts
first
that
the
cherusci
were
old
saxons
or
saxons
of
the
interior
of
germany
secondly
that
the
or
saxons
of
the
coast
of
germany
were
more
closely
akin
than
other
german
tribes
were
to
the
cheruscan
saxons
thirdly
that
the
old
saxons
were
almost
exterminated
by
charlemagne
fourthly
that
the
are
our
immediate
ancestors
the
last
of
these
may
be
assumed
as
an
axiom
in
english
history
the
proofs
of
the
other
three
are
partly
philological
and
partly
historical
i
have
not
space
to
go
into
them
here
but
they
will
be
found
in
the
early
chapters
of
the
great
work
of
robert
gordon
latham
on
the
english
language
and
in
the
notes
to
his
edition
of
the
germania
of
tacitus
it
may
be
however
here
remarked
that
the
present
saxons
of
germany
are
of
the
high
germanic
division
of
the
german
race
whereas
both
the
and
old
saxon
were
of
the
low
germanic
being
thus
the
nearest
heirs
of
the
glory
of
arminius
we
may
fairly
devote
more
attention
to
his
career
than
in
such
a
work
as
the
present
could
be
allowed
to
any
individual
leader
and
it
is
interesting
to
trace
how
far
his
fame
survived
during
the
middle
ages
both
among
the
germans
of
the
continent
and
among
ourselves
it
seems
probable
that
the
jealousy
with
which
maraboduus
the
king
of
the
suevi
and
marcomanni
regarded
arminius
and
which
ultimately
broke
out
into
open
hostilities
between
those
german
tribes
and
the
cherusci
prevented
arminius
from
leading
the
confederate
germans
to
attack
italy
after
his
first
victory
perhaps
he
may
have
had
the
rare
moderation
of
being
content
with
the
liberation
of
his
country
without
seeking
to
retaliate
on
her
former
oppressors
when
tiberius
marched
into
germany
in
the
year
arminius
was
too
cautious
to
attack
him
on
ground
favourable
to
the
legions
and
tiberius
was
too
skilful
to
entangle
his
troops
in
difficult
parts
of
the
country
his
march
and
were
as
unresisted
as
they
were
unproductive
a
few
years
later
when
a
dangerous
revolt
of
the
roman
legions
near
the
frontier
caused
their
generals
to
find
them
active
employment
by
leading
them
into
the
interior
of
germany
we
find
arminius
again
energetic
in
his
defence
the
old
quarrel
between
him
and
his
segestes
had
broken
out
afresh
segestes
now
called
in
the
aid
of
the
roman
general
germanicus
to
whom
he
surrendered
himself
and
by
his
contrivance
his
daughter
thusnelda
the
wife
of
arminius
also
came
into
the
hands
of
the
romans
being
far
advanced
in
pregnancy
she
showed
as
tacitus
relates
ann
i
more
of
the
spirit
of
her
husband
than
of
her
father
a
spirit
that
could
not
be
subdued
into
tears
or
supplications
she
was
sent
to
ravenna
and
there
gave
birth
to
a
son
whose
life
we
find
from
an
allusion
in
tacitus
to
have
been
eventful
and
unhappy
but
the
part
of
the
great
historian
work
which
narrated
his
fate
has
perished
and
we
only
know
from
another
quarter
that
the
son
of
arminius
was
at
the
age
of
four
years
led
captive
in
a
triumphal
pageant
along
the
streets
of
rome
the
high
spirit
of
arminius
was
goaded
almost
into
frenzy
by
these
bereavements
the
fate
of
his
wife
thus
torn
from
him
and
of
his
babe
doomed
to
bondage
even
before
its
birth
inflamed
the
eloquent
invectives
with
which
he
roused
his
countrymen
against
the
home
traitors
and
against
their
invaders
who
thus
made
war
upon
women
and
children
germanicus
had
marched
his
army
to
the
place
where
varus
had
perished
and
had
there
paid
funeral
honours
to
the
ghastly
relics
of
his
predecessor
legions
that
he
found
heaped
around
him
in
the
museum
of
rhenish
antiquities
at
bonn
there
is
a
roman
sepulchral
monument
the
inscription
on

records
that
it
was
erected
to
the
memory
of

who
fell

arminius
lured
him
to
advance
a
little
further
into
the
country
and
then
assailed
him
and
fought
a
battle
which
by
the
roman
accounts
was
a
drawn
one
the
effect
of
it
was
to
make
germanicus
resolve
on
retreating
to
the
rhine
he
himself
with
part
of
his
troops
embarked
in
some
vessels
on
the
ems
and
returned
by
that
river
and
then
by
sea
but
part
of
his
forces
were
entrusted
to
a
roman
general
named
caecina
to
lead
them
back
by
land
to
the
rhine
arminius
followed
this
division
on
its
march
and
fought
several
battles
with
it
in
which
he
inflicted
heavy
loss
on
the
romans
captured
the
greater
part
of
their
baggage
and
would
have
destroyed
them
completely
had
not
his
skilful
system
of
operations
been
finally
thwarted
by
the
haste
of
inguiomerus
a
confederate
german
chief
who
insisted
on
assaulting
the
romans
in
their
camp
instead
of
waiting
till
they
were
entangled
in
the
difficulties
of
the
country
and
assailing
their
columns
on
the
march
in
the
following
year
the
romans
were
inactive
but
in
the
year
afterwards
germanicus
led
a
fresh
invasion
he
placed
his
army
on
and
sailed
to
the
mouth
of
the
ems

he
disembarked
and
marched
to
the
weser
where
he
encamped
probably
in
the
neighbourhood
of

had
collected
his
army
on
the
other
side
of

a
scene
occurred
which
is
powerfully
told
by
tacitus
and
which
is
the
subject
of
a
beautiful
poem
by
praed
it
has
been
already
mentioned
that
the
brother
of
arminius
like
himself
had
been
trained
up
while
young
to
serve
in
the
roman
armies
but
unlike
arminius
he
not
only
refused
to
quit
the
roman
service
for
that
of
his
country
but
fought
against
his
country
with
the
legions
of
germanicus
he
had
assumed
the
roman
name
of
flavius
and
had
gained
considerable
distinction
in
the
roman
service
in
which
he
had
lost
an
eye
from
a
wound
in
battle
when
the
roman
outposts
approached
the
river
weser
arminius
called
out
to
them
from
the
opposite
bank
and
expressed
a
wish
to
see
his
brother
flavius
stepped
forward
and
arminius
ordered
his
own
followers
to
retire
and
requested
that
the
archers
should
be
removed
from
the
roman
bank
of
the
river
this
was
done
and
the
brothers
who
apparently
had
not
seen
each
other
for
some
years
began
a
conversation
from
the
opposite
sides
of
the
stream
in
which
arminius
questioned
his
brother
respecting
the
loss
of
his
eye
and
what
battle
it
had
been
lost
in
and
what
reward
he
had
received
for
his
wound
flavius
told
him
how
the
eye
was
destroyed
and
mentioned
the
increased
pay
that
he
had
on
account
of
its
loss
and
showed
the
collar
and
other
military
decorations
that
had
been
given
him
arminius
mocked
at
these
as
badges
of
slavery
and
then
each
began
to
try
to
win
the
other
over
flavius
boasting
the
power
of
rome
and
her
generosity
to
the
submissive
arminius
appealing
to
him
in
the
name
of
their
gods
of
the
mother
that
had
borne
them
and
by
the
holy
names
of
fatherland
and
freedom
not
to
prefer
being
the
betrayer
to
being
the
champion
of
his
country
they
soon
proceeded
to
mutual
taunts
and
menaces
and
flavius
called
aloud
for
his
horse
and
his
arms
that
he
might
dash
across
the
river
and
attack
his
brother
nor
would
he
have
been
checked
from
doing
so
had
not
the
roman
general
stertinius
run
up
to
him
and
forcibly
detained
him
arminius
stood
on
the
other
bank
threatening
the
renegade
and
defying
him
to
battle
i
shall
not
be
thought
to
need
apology
for
quoting
here
the
stanzas
in
which
praed
has
described
this
scene
a
scene
among
the
most
affecting
as
well
as
the
most
striking
that
history
supplies
it
makes
us
reflect
on
the
desolate
position
of
arminius
with
his
wife
and
child
captives
in
the
enemy
hands
and
with
his
brother
a
renegade
in
arms
against
him
the
great
liberator
of
our
german
race
stood
there
with
every
source
of
human
happiness
denied
him
except
the
consciousness
of
doing
his
duty
to
his
country
back
back
he
fears
not
foaming

who
fears
not

the

pride
and
of
a

name
but
it
is
past
where
heroes
press
and
cowards
bend
the
knee
arminius
is
not
brotherless
his
brethren
are
the
free
they
come
around
one
hour
and

will
fade
from

and

onward
onward
to
the

with
darkness
for
our
guide
when
we
shall
meet
in
combat
face

then
only
would
arminius
greet
the
renegade
embrace
the
canker
of
rome
guilt
shall
be
upon
his
dying
name
and
as
he
lived
in
slavery
so
shall
he
fall
in
shame
on
the
day
after
the
romans
had
reached
the
weser
germanicus
led
his
army
across
that
river
and
a
partial
encounter
took
place
in
which
arminius
was
successful
but
on
the
succeeding
day
a
general
action
was
fought
in
which
arminius
was
severely
wounded
and
the
german
infantry
routed
with
heavy
loss
the
horsemen
of
the
two
armies
encountered
without
either
party
gaining
the
advantage
but
the
roman
army
remained
master
of
the
ground
and
claimed
a
complete
victory
germanicus
erected
a
trophy
in
the
field
with
a
vaunting
inscription
that
the
nations
between
the
rhine
and
the
elbe
had
been
thoroughly
conquered
by
his
army
but
that
army
speedily
made
a
final
retreat
to
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
nor
was
the
effect
of
their
campaign
more
durable
than
their
trophy
the
sarcasm
with
which
tacitus
speaks
of
certain
other
triumphs
of
roman
generals
over
germans
may
apply
to
the
pageant
which
germanicus
celebrated
on
his
return
to

command
of
the
roman
army
of
the
rhine
the
germans
were
triumphati

after
the
romans
had
abandoned
their
attempts
on
germany
we
find
arminius
engaged
in
hostilities
with
maroboduus
the
king
of
the
suevi
and
marcomanni
who
was
endeavouring
to
bring
the
other
german
tribes
into
a
state
of
dependency
on
him
arminius
was
at
the
head
of
the
germans
who
took
up
arms
against
this
home
invader
of
their
liberties
after
some
minor
engagements
a
pitched
battle
was
fought
between
the
two
confederacies
in
which
the
loss
on
each
side
was
equal
but
maroboduus
confessed
the
ascendency
of
his
antagonist
by
avoiding
a
renewal
of
the
engagement
and
by
imploring
the
intervention
of
the
romans
in
his
defence
the
younger
drusus
then
commanded
the
roman
legions
in
the
province
of
illyricum
and
by
his
mediation
a
peace
was
concluded
between
arminius
and
maroboduus
by
the
terms
of
which
it
is
evident
that
the
latter
must
have
renounced
his
ambitious
schemes
against
the
freedom
of
the
other
german
tribes
arminius
did
not
long
survive
this
second
war
of
independence
which
he
successfully
waged
for
his
country
he
was
assassinated
in
the
year
of
his
age
by
some
of
his
own
kinsmen
who
conspired
against
him
tacitus
says
that
this
happened
while
he
was
engaged
in
a
civil
war
which
had
been
caused
by
his
attempts
to
make
himself
king
over
his
countrymen
it
is
far
more
probable
as
one
of
the
best
biographers
of
arminius
has
observed
that
tacitus
misunderstood
an
attempt
of
arminius
to
extend
his
influence
as
elective
of
the
cherusci
and
other
tribes
for
an
attempt
to
obtain
the
royal
dignity

remember
that
his
and
his
brother
were
renegades
we
can
well
understand
that
a
party
among
his
kinsmen
may
have
been
bitterly
hostile
to
him
and
have
opposed
his
authority
with
the
tribe
by
open
violence
and
when
that
seemed
ineffectual

assassination
arminius
left
a
name
which
the
historians

the
nation
against
which
he
combated
so
long
and
so
gloriously
have
delighted
to
honour

about
ten
centuries
and
a
half
after
the
demolition
of
the
and
nearly
eighteen
after
the
death
of
arminius
the
modern
germans
conceived
the
idea
of
rendering
tardy
homage
to
their
great
hero
and
accordingly
some
eight
or
ten
years
ago
a
general
subscription
was
organized
in
germany
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
on
the
osning
a
conical
mountain
which
forms
the
highest
summit
of
the
teutoberger
wald
and
is
eighteen
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
a
colossal
bronze
statue
of
arminius
the
statue
was
designed
by
bandel
the
hero
was
to
stand
uplifting
a
sword
in
his
right
hand
and
looking
towards
the
rhine
the
height
of
the
statue
was
to
be
eighty
feet
from
the
base
to
the
point
of
the
sword
and
was
to
stand
on
a
circular
gothic
temple
ninety
feet
high
and
supported
by
oak
trees
as
columns
the
mountain
where
it
was
to
be
erected
is
wild
and
stern
and
overlooks
the
scene
of
the
battle
it
was
calculated
that
the
statue
would
be
clearly
visible
at
a
distance
of
sixty
miles
the
temple
is
nearly
finished
and
the
statue
itself
has
been
cast
at
the
copper
works
at
lemgo
but
there
through
want
of
funds
to
set
it
up
it
has
lain
for
some
years
in
disjointed
fragments
exposed
to
the
mutilating
homage
of
travellers
the
idea
of
honouring
a
hero
who
belongs
to
all
germany
is
not
one
which
the
present
rulers
of
that
divided
country
have
any
wish
to
encourage
and
the
statue
may
long
continue
to
lie
there
and
present

type
of
the
condition

must
repeat
an
acknowledgment
of
my
obligations
to
my
friend
henry
pearson
surely
this
is
an
occasion
in
which
englishmen
might
well
prove
by
acts
as
well
as
words
that
we
also
rank
arminius
among
our
heroes
i
have
quoted
the
noble
stanzas
of
one
of
our
modern
english
poets
on
arminius

i
will
conclude
this

with
one
of
the
odes
of
the
great
poet
of
modern
germany
klopstock
on
the
victory
to
which
we
owe
our
freedom

arminius
mainly
owes
his
fame

in
order
to
estimate
the
full
importance
to
mankind
of
the

of

we
must
keep
steadily
in
mind
who
and
what
the
germans
were
and
the
important
distinctions
between
them
and
the
numerous
other
races
that
assailed
the
roman
empire
and
it
is
to
be
understood
that
the
gothic
and
the
scandinavian
nations
are
included
in
the
german
race
now
in
two
remarkable
traits
the
germans
differed
from
the
sarmatic
as
well
as
from
the
slavic
nations
and
indeed
from
all
those
other
races
to
whom
the
greeks
and
romans
gave
the
designation
of
barbarians
i
allude
to
their
personal
freedom
and
regards
for
the
rights
of
men
secondly
to
the
respect
paid
by
them
to
the
female
sex
and
the
chastity
for
which
the
latter
were
celebrated
among
the
people
of
the
north
these
were
the
foundations
of
that
probity
of
character
and
purity
of
manners
which
may
be
traced
among
the
germans
and
goths
even
during
pagan
times
and
which
when
their
sentiments
were
enlightened
by
christianity
brought
out
those
splendid
traits
of
character
which
distinguish
the
age
of
chivalry
and

the

fell

caused
probably
by
dissensions
among

chiefs
and
also
by
their
arms
being
employed
in
attack
upon
the
scandinavian
nations
but
when
attila
or
atzel
as
he
is
called
in
the
hungarian
language
became
their
ruler
the
torrent
of
their
arms
was
directed
with
augmented
terrors
upon
the
west
and
the
south
and
their
myriads
marched
beneath
the
guidance
of
one
to
the
overthrow
both
of
the
new
and
the
old
powers
of
the
earth
recent
events
have
thrown
such
a
strong
interest
over
everything
connected
with
the
hungarian
name
that
even
the
terrible
name
of
attila
now
impresses
us
the
more
vividly
through
our
sympathising
admiration
of
the
exploits
of
those
who
claim
to
be
descended
from
his
warriors
and
ambitiously
insert
the
name
of
attila
among
their
native
kings
the
authenticity
of
this
martial
genealogy
is
denied
by
some
writers
and
questioned
by
more
but
it
is
at
least
certain
that
the
magyars
of
arpad
who
are
the
immediate
ancestors
of
the
bulk
of
the
modern
hungarians
and
who
conquered
the
country
which
bears
the
name
of
hungary
in
were
of
the
same
stock
of
mankind
as
were
the
huns
of
attila
even
if
they
did
not
belong
to
the
same
subdivision
of
that
stock
nor
is
there
any
improbability
in
the
tradition
that
after
attila
death
many
of
his
warriors
remained
in
hungary
and
that
their
descendants
afterwards
joined
the
huns
of
arpad
in
their
career
of
conquest
it
is
certain
that
attila
made
hungary
the
seat
of
his
empire
it
seems
also
susceptible
of
clear
proof
that
the
territory
was
then
called
hungvar
and
attila
soldiers
hungvari
both
the
huns
of
attila
and
those
of
arpad
came
from
the
family
of
nomadic
nations
whose
primitive
regions
were
those
vast
wildernesses
of
high
asia
which
are
included
between
the
altaic
and
the
himalayan
the
inroads
of
these
tribes
upon
the
lower
regions
of
asia
and
into
europe
have
caused
many
of
the
most
remarkable
revolutions
in
the
history
of
the
world
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
swarms
of
these
nations
made
their
way
into
distant
parts
of
the
earth
at
periods
long
before
the
date
of
the
scythian
invasion
of
asia
which
is
the
earliest
inroad
of
the
nomadic
race
that
history
records
the
first
as
far
as
we
can
conjecture
in
respect
to
the
time
of
their
descent
were
the
finnish
and
ugrian
tribes
who
appear
to
have
come
down
from
the
asiatic
border
of
high
asia
towards
the
in
which
direction
they
advanced
to
the
uralian
mountains
there
they
established
themselves
and
that
mountain
chain
with
its
valleys
and
became
to
them
a
new
country
whence
they
sent
out
colonies
on
every
side
but
the
ugrian
colony
which
under
arpad
occupied
hungary
and
became
the
ancestors
of
the
bulk
of
the
present
hungarian
nation
did
not
quit
their
settlements
on
the
uralian
mountains
till
a
very
late
period
not
until
four
centuries
after
the
time
when
attila
led
from
the
primary
seats
of
the
nomadic
races
in
high
asia

with
which
he
advanced
into
the

down
to
us
through
the
partial
and
suspicious
medium
of
chroniclers
and
poets
of
his
own
race
it
is
not
from
hunnish
authorities
that
we
learn
the
extent
of
his
might
it
is
from
his
enemies
from
the
literature
and
the
legends
of
the
nations
whom
he
afflicted
with
his
arms
that
we
draw
the
unquestionable
evidence
of
his
greatness
besides
the
express
narratives
of
byzantine
latin
and
gothic
writers
we
have
the
strongest
proof
of
the
stern
reality
of
attila
conquests
in
the
extent
to
which
he
and
his
huns
have
been
the
themes
of
the
earliest
german
and
scandinavian
lays
wild
as
many
of
these
legends
are
they
bear
concurrent
and
certain
testimony
to
the
awe
with
which
the
memory
of
attila
was
regarded
by
the
bold
warriors
who
composed
and
delighted
in
them
attila
exploits
and
the
wonders
of
his
unearthly
steed
and
magic
sword
repeatedly
occur
in
the
sagas
of
norway
and
iceland
and
the
celebrated
niebelungen
lied
the
most
ancient
of
germanic
poetry
is
full
of
them
there
etsel
or
attila
is
described
as
the
wearer
of
twelve
mighty
crowns
and
as
promising
to
his
bride
the
lands
of
thirty
kings
whom
his
irresistible
sword
has
subdued
he
is
in
fact
the
hero
of
the
latter
part
of
this
remarkable
poem
and
it
is
at
his
capital
city
etselenburgh
which
evidently
corresponds
to
the
modern
buda
that
much
of
its
action
takes
place
when
we
turn
from
the
legendary
to
the
historic
attila
we
see
clearly
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
vulgar
herd
of
barbaric
conquerors
consummate
military
skill
may
be
traced
in
his
campaigns
and
he
relied
far
less
on
the
brute
force
of
armies
for
the
aggrandizement
of
his
empire
than
on
the
unbounded
influence
over
the
affections
of
friends
and
the
fears
of
foes
which
his
genius
enabled
him
to
acquire
austerely
sober
in
his
private
life
severely
just
on
the
conspicuous
among
a
nation
of
warriors
for
hardihood
strength
and
skill
in
every
martial
exercise
grave
and
deliberate
in
counsel
but
rapid
and
remorseless
in
execution
he
gave
safety
and
security
to
all
who
were
under
his
dominion
while
he
waged
a
warfare
of
extermination
against
all
who
opposed
or
sought
to
escape
from
it
he
matched
the
national
passions
the
prejudices
the
creeds
and
the
superstitions
of
the
varied
nations
over
which
he
ruled
and
of
those
which
he
sought
to
reduce
beneath
his
sway
and
these
feelings
he
had
the
skill
to
turn
to
his
own
account
his
own
warriors
believed
him
to
be
the
inspired
favourite
of
their
deities
and
followed
him
with
fanatic
zeal
his
enemies
looked
on
him
as
the
minister
of
heaven
wrath
against
themselves
and
though
they
believed
not
in
his
creed
their
own
made
them
tremble
before
him
in
one
of
his
early
campaigns
he
appeared
before
his
troops
with
an
ancient
iron
sword
in
his
grasp
which
he
told
them
was
the
god
of
war
whom
their
ancestors
had
worshipped
it
is
certain
that
the
nomadic
tribes
of
northern
asia
whom
herodotus
described
under
the
name
of
scythians
from
the
earliest
times
worshipped
as
their
god
a
bare
sword
that
was
supposed
in
attila
time
to
have
disappeared
from
earth
but
the
hunnish
king
now
claimed
to
have
received
it
by
special
revelation
it
was
said
that
a
herdsman
who
was
tracking
in
the
desert
a
wounded
heifer
by
the
drops
of
blood
found
the
mysterious
sword
standing
fixed
in
the
ground
as
if
it
had
been
darted
down
from
heaven
the
herdsman
bore
it
to
attila
who
thenceforth
was
believed
by
the
huns
to
wield
the
spirit
of
death
in
battle
and
the
seers
prophesied
that
that
sword
was
to
destroy
the
world
a
roman
priscus
who
was
on
an
embassy
to
the
hunnish
camp
recorded
in
his
memoirs
acquisition
of
this
supernatural
weapon
and
the
immense
influence
over
the
minds
of
the
barbaric
tribes
which
its
possession
gave
him
in
the
title
which
he
assumed
we
shall
see
the
skill
with
which
he
availed
himself
of
the
legends
and
creeds
of
other
nations
as
well
as
of
his
own
he
designated
himself
attila
descendant
of
the
great
nimrod
nurtured
in
engaddi
by
the
grace
of
god
king
of
the
huns
the
goths
the
danes
and
the
medes
the
dread
of
the
world
herbert
states
that
attila
is
represented
on
an
old
medallion
with
a
teraphim
or
a
head
on
his
breast
and
the
same
writer
adds
we
know
from
the
of
prudentius
that
nimrod
with
a
head
was
the
object
of
adoration
to
the
heretical
followers
of
marcion
and
the
same
head
was
the
palladium
set
up
by
antiochus
epiphanes
over
the
gates
of
antioch
though
it
has
been
called
the
visage
of
charon
the
memory
of
nimrod
was
certainly
regarded
with
mystic
veneration
by
many
and
by
asserting
himself
to
be
the
heir
of
that
mighty
hunter
before
the
lord
he
vindicated
to
himself
at
least
the
whole
babylonian
kingdom
the
singular
assertion
in
his
style
that
he
was
nurtured
in
engaddi
where
he
certainly
had
never
been
will
be
more
easily
understood
on
reference
to
the
twelfth
chapter
of
the
book
of
revelation
concerning
the
woman
clothed
with
the
sun
who
was
to
bring
forth
in
the
wilderness
she
hath
a
place
prepared
of
god
a
who
was
to
contend
with
the
dragon
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
rule
all
nations
with
a
rod
of
iron
this
prophecy
was
at
that
time
understood
universally
by
the
sincere
christians
to
refer
to
the
birth
of
constantine
who
was
to
overwhelm
the
paganism
of
the
city
on
the
seven
hills
and
it
is
still
so
explained
but
it
is
evident
that
the
heathens
must
have
looked
on
it
in
a
different
light
and
have
regarded
it
as
a
foretelling
of
the
birth
of
that
great
one
who
should
master
the
temporal
power
of
rome
the
assertion
therefore
that
he
was
nurtured
in
engaddi
is
a
claim
to
be
looked
upon
as
that
who
was
to
be
brought
forth
in
a
place
prepared
of
god
in
the
wilderness
engaddi
means
a
place
of
palms
and
vines
in
the
desert
it
was
hard
by
zoar
the
city
of
refuge
which
was
saved
in
the
vale
of
siddim
or
demons
when
the
rest
were
destroyed
by
fire
and
brimstone
from
the
lord
in
heaven
and
might
therefore
be
especially
called
a
place
prepared
of
god
in
the
wilderness
it
is
obvious
enough
why
he
styled
himself
by
the
grace
of
god
king
of
the
huns
and
goths
and
it
seems
far
from
difficult
to
see
why
he
added
the
names
of
the
medes
and
the
danes
his
armies
had
been
engaged
in
warfare
against
the
persian
kingdom
of
the
sassanidae
and
it
is
certain
see
the
narrative
of
priscus
that
he
meditated
the
attack
and
overthrow
of
the
power
probably
some
of
the
northern
provinces
of
that
kingdom
had
been
compelled
to
pay
him
tribute
and
this
would
account
for
his
styling
himself
king
of
the
medes
they
being
his
remotest
subjects
to
the
south
from
a
similar
cause
he
may
have
called
himself
king
of
the
danes
as
his
power
may
well
have
extended
northwards
as
far
as
the
nearest
of
the
scandinavian
nations
and
this
mention
of
medes
and
danes
as
his
subjects
would
serve
at
once
to
indicate
the
vast
extent
of
his
dominion
in
the
the
old
poet
who
describes
the
reception
of
the
heroine
chrimhild
by
attila
etsel
says
that
attila
dominions
were
so
vast
that
among
his
there
were
russian
greek
wallachian
polish
and
even
danish
knights
the
extensive
territory
north
of
the
danube
and
black
sea
and
eastward
of
caucasus
over
which
attila
ruled
first
in
conjunction
with
his
brother
bleda
and
afterwards
alone
can
not
be
very
accurately
defined
but
it
must
have
comprised
within
it
besides
the
huns
many
nations
of
slavic
gothic
teutonic
and
finnish
origin
south
also
of
the
danube
the
country
from
the
river
sau
as
far
as
novi
in
thrace
was
a
hunnish
province
such
was
the
empire
of
the
huns
in
a
memorable
year
in
which
attila
founded
buda
on
the
danube
as
his
capital
city
and
ridded
himself
of
his
brother
by
a
crime
which
seems
to
have
been
prompted
not
only
by
selfish
ambition
but
also
by
a
desire
of
turning
to
his
purpose
the
legends
and
forebodings
which
then
were
universally
spread
throughout
the
roman
empire
and
must
have
been
well
known
to
the
watchful
and
ruthless
hun
the
year
of
our
era
completed
the
twelfth
century
from
the
foundation
of
rome
according
to
the
best
chronologers
it
had
always
been
believed
among
the
romans
that
the
twelve
vultures
which
were
said
to
have
appeared
to
romulus
when
he
founded
the
city
signified
the
time
during
which
the
roman
power
should
endure
the
twelve
vultures
denoted
twelve
centuries
this
interpretation
of
the
vision
of
the
birds
of
destiny
was
current
among
learned
romans
even
when
there
were
yet
many
of
the
twelve
centuries
to
run
and
while
the
imperial
city
was
at
the
zenith
of
its
power
but
as
the
allotted
time
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
its
conclusion
and
as
rome
grew
weaker
and
weaker
beneath
the
blows
of
barbaric
invaders
the
terrible
omen
was
more
and
more
talked
and
thought
of
and
in
attila
time
men
watched
for
the
momentary
extinction
of
the
roman
state
with
the
last
beat
of
the
last
wing
moreover
among
the
numerous
legends
connected
with
the
foundation
of
the
city
and
the
fratricidal
death
of
remus
there
was
one
most
terrible
one
which
told
that
romulus
did
not
put
his
brother
to
death
in
accident
or
in
hasty
quarrel
but
that
he
slew
his
gallant
twin
with
inexpiable
sin
deliberately
and
in
compliance
with
the
warnings
of
supernatural
powers
the
shedding
of
a
brother
blood
was
believed
to
have
been
the
price
at
which
the
founder
of
rome
had
purchased
from
destiny
her
twelve
centuries
of
existence
see
a
curious
justification
of
attila
murder
of
his
brother
by
a
zealous
hungarian
advocate
in
the
note
to
annales
hunnorum
the
example
of
romulus
is
the
main
authority
quoted
we
may
imagine
therefore
with
what
terror
in
this
the
year
after
the
foundation
of
rome
the
inhabitants
of
the
roman
empire
must
have
heard
the
tidings
that
the
royal
brethren
attila
and
bleda
had
founded
a
new
capitol
on
the
danube
which
was
designed
to
rule
over
the
ancient
capitol
on
the
tiber
and
that
attila
like
romulus
had
consecrated
the
foundations
of
his
new
city
by
murdering
his
brother
so
that
for
the
new
cycle
of
centuries
then
about
to
commence
dominion
had
been
bought
from
the
gloomy
spirits
of
destiny
in
favour
of
the
hun
by
a
sacrifice
of
equal
awe
and
value
with
that
which
had
formerly
obtained
it
for
the
romans
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
not
only
the
pagans
but
also
the
christians
of
that
age
knew
and
believed
in
these
legends
and
omens
however
they
might
differ
as
to
the
nature
of
the
superhuman
agency
by
which
such
mysteries
had
been
made
known
to
mankind
and
we
may
observe
with
herbert
a
modern
learned
dignitary
of
our
church
how
remarkably
this
augury
was
fulfilled
for
if
to
the
twelve
centuries
denoted
by
the
twelve
vultures
that
appeared
to
romulus
we
add
for
the
six
birds
that
appeared
to
remus
six
lustra
or
periods
of
five
years
each
by
which
the
romans
were
wont
to
number
their
time
it
brings
us
precisely
to
the
year
in
which
the
roman
empire
was
finally
extinguished
by
odoacer
an
attempt
to
assassinate
attila
made
or
supposed
to
have
been
made
at
the
instigation
of
theodosius
the
younger
the
emperor
of
constantinople
drew
the
hunnish
armies
in
upon
the
eastern
empire
and
delayed
for
a
time
the
destined
blow
against
rome
probably
a
more
important
cause
of
delay
was
the
revolt
of
some
of
the
hunnish
tribes
to
the
north
of
the
black
sea
against
attila
which
broke
out
about
this
period
and
is
cursorily
mentioned
by
the
byzantine
writers
attila
quelled
this
revolt
and
having
thus
consolidated
his
power
and
having
punished
the
presumption
of
the
eastern
roman
emperor
by
fearful
ravages
of
his
fairest
provinces
attila
prepared
to
set
his
vast
forces
in
motion
for
the
conquest
of
western
europe
he
sought
unsuccessfully
by
diplomatic
intrigues
to
detach
the
king
of
the
visigoths
from
his
alliance
with
rome
and
he
resolved
first
to
crush
the
power
of
theodoric
and
then
to
advance
with
overwhelming
power
to
trample
out
the
last
sparks
of
the
doomed
roman
empire
a
strong
invitation
from
a
roman
princess
gave
him
a
pretext
for
the
war
and
threw
an
air
of
chivalric
enterprise
over
his
invasion
honoria
sister
of
valentinian
the
emperor
of
the
west
had
sent
to
attila
to
offer
him
her
hand
and
her
supposed
right
to
share
in
the
imperial
power
this
had
been
discovered
by
romans
and
honoria
had
been
forthwith
closely
imprisoned
attila
now
pretended
to
take
up
arms
in
behalf
of
his
bride
and
proclaimed
that
he
was
about
to
march
to
rome
to
redress
honoria
wrongs
ambition
and
spite
against
her
brother
must
have
been
the
sole
motives
that
led
the
lady
to
woo
the
royal
hun
for
attila
face
and
person
had
all
the
national
ugliness
of
his
race
and
the
description
given
of
him
by
a
byzantine
ambassador
must
have
been
well
known
in
the
imperial
courts
herbert
has
well
versified
the
portrait
drawn
by
priscus
of
the
great
enemy
of
both
byzantium
and
rome
terrific
was
his
semblance
in
no
mould
of
beautiful
proportion
cast
his
limbs
nothing
exalted
but
with
sinews
braced
of
chalybaean
temper
agile
lithe
and
swifter
than
the
roe
his
ample
chest
was
overbrowed
by
a
gigantic
head
with
eyes
keen
deeply
sunk
and
small
that
strangely
in
wrath
as
though
some
spirit
unclean
within
that
corporal
tenement
installed
look
from
its
windows
but
with
temper
fire
beam
mildly
on
the
unresisting
thin
his
beard
and
hoary
his
flat
nostrils
a
cicatrised
swart
visage
but
withal
that
questionable
shape
such
glory
wore
that
mortals
quail
beneath
him
two
chiefs
of
the
franks
who
were
then
settled
on
the
lower
rhine
were
at
this
period
engaged
in
a
feud
with
each
other
and
while
one
of
them
appealed
to
the
romans
for
aid
the
other
invoked
the
assistance
and
protection
of
the
huns
attila
thus
obtained
an
ally
whose
secured
for
him
the
passage
of
the
rhine
and
it
was
this
circumstance
which
caused
him
to
take
a
northward
route
from
hungary
for
his
attack
upon
gaul
the
muster
of
the
hunnish
hosts
was
swollen
by
warriors
of
every
tribe
that
they
had
subjugated
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
suspect
the
old
chroniclers
of
wilful
exaggeration
in
estimating
attila
army
at
seven
hundred
thousand
strong
having
crossed
the
rhine
probably
a
little
below
coblentz
he
defeated
the
king
of
the
burgundians
who
endeavoured
to
bar
his
progress
he
then
divided
his
vast
forces
into
two
armies
one
of
which
marched
upon
tongres
and
arras
and
the
other
cities
of
that
part
of
france
while
the
main
body
under
attila
himself
marched
up
the
moselle
and
destroyed
besancon
and
other
towns
in
the
country
of
the
burgundians
one
of
the
latest
and
best
biographers
of
attila
well
observes
that
having
thus
conquered
the
eastern
part
of
france
attila
prepared
for
an
invasion
of
the
west
gothic
territories
beyond
the
loire
he
marched
upon
orleans
where
he
intended
to
force
the
passage
of
that
river
and
only
a
little
attention
is
requisite
to
enable
us
to
perceive
that
he
proceeded
on
a
systematic
plan
he
had
his
right
wing
on
the
north
for
the
protection
of
his
frank
allies
his
left
wing
on
the
south
for
the
purpose

the

skilfully
defended
against

effected
a
junction
of
their
armies
to
the
south
of
that
important
river
on
the

attila
instantly
broke
up
the
siege
of
that
city
and
retreated
towards
the

he
did
not
choose
to
risk
a
decisive
battle
with
only
the
central
corps
of
his
army
against
the
combined
power
of
his
enemies
and
he
therefore
fell
back
upon
his
base
of
operations
calling
in
his
wings
from
arras
and
besancon
and
concentrating
the
whole
of
the
hunnish
forces
on
the
vast
plains
of
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
how
scientifically
this
place
was
chosen
by
the
hunnish
general
as
the
point
for
his
scattered
forces
to
converge
upon
and
the
nature
of
the
ground
was
eminently
favourable
for
the
operations
of
cavalry
the
arm
in
which
attila
strength
peculiarly
lay
it
was
during
the
retreat
from
orleans
that
a
christian
is
reported
to
have
approached
the
hunnish
king
and
said
to
him
thou
art
the
scourge
of
god
for
the
chastisement
of
christians
attila
instantly
assumed
this
new
title
of
terror
which
thenceforth
became
the
appellation
by
which
he
was
most
widely
and
most
fearfully
known
the
confederate
armies
of
romans
and
visigoths
at
last
met
their
great
adversary

of

right
of
the

theodoric
on
the
left
and
sangipan
king
of
the
alans
whose
fidelity
was
suspected
was
placed
purposely
in
the
centre
and
in
the
very
front
of
the
battle
attila
commanded
his
centre
in
person
at
the
head
of
his
own
countrymen
while
the
ostrogoths
the
gepidae
and
the
other
subject
allies
of
the
huns
were
drawn
up
on
the
wings
some
manoeuvring
appears
to
have
occurred
before
the
engagement
in
which
attila
had
the
advantage
inasmuch
as
he
succeeded
in
occupying
a
sloping
hill
which
commanded
the
left
flank
of
the
huns
attila
saw
the
importance
of
the
position
taken
by
aetius
on
the
high
ground
and
commenced
the
battle
by
a
furious
attack
on
this
part
of
the
roman
line
in
which
he
seems
to
have
detached
some
of
his
best
troops
from
his
centre
to
aid
his
left
the
romans
having
the
advantage
of
the
ground
repulsed
the
huns
and
while
the
allies
gained
this
advantage
on
their
right
their
left
under
king
theodoric
assailed
the
ostrogoths
who
formed
the
right
of
attila
army
the
gallant
king
was
himself
struck
down
by
a
javelin
as
he
rode
onward
at
the
head
of
his
men
and
his
own
cavalry
charging
over
him
trampled
him
to
death
in
the
confusion
but
the
visigoths
infuriated
not
dispirited
by
their
monarch
fall
routed
the
enemies
opposed
to
them
and
then
wheeled
upon
the
flank
of
the
hunnish
centre
which
had
been
engaged
in
a
sanguinary
and
indecisive
contest
with
the
alans
in
this
peril
attila
made
his
centre
fall
back
upon
his
camp
and
when
the
shelter
of
its
entrenchments
and
waggons
had
once
been
gained
the
hunnish
archers
repulsed
without
difficulty
the
charges
of
the
vengeful
gothic
cavalry
aetius
had
not
pressed
the
advantage
which
he
gained
on
his
side
of
the
field
and
when
night
fell
over
the
wild
scene
of
havoc
attila
left
was
still
unbroken
but
his
right
had
been
routed
and
his
centre
forced
back
upon
his
camp
expecting
an
assault
on
the
morrow
attila
stationed
his
best
archers
in
front
of
the
cars
and
waggons
which
were
drawn
up
as
a
fortification
along
his
lines
and
made
every
preparation
for
a
desperate
resistance
but
the
scourge
of
god
resolved
that
no
man
should
boast
of
the
honour
of
having
either
captured
or
slain
him
and
he
caused
to
be
raised
in
the
centre
of
his
encampment
a
huge
pyramid
of
the
wooden
saddles
of
his
cavalry
round
it
he
heaped
the
spoils
and
the
wealth
that
he
had
won
on
it
he
stationed
his
wives
who
had
accompanied
him
in
the
campaign
and
on
the
summit
he
placed
himself
ready
to
perish
in
the
flames
and
baulk
the
victorious
foe
of
their
choicest
booty
should
they
succeed
in
storming
his
defences
but
when
the
morning
broke
and
revealed
the
extent
of
the
carnage
with
which
the
plains
were
heaped
for
miles
the
successful
allies
saw
also
and
respected
the
resolute
attitude
of
their
antagonist
neither
were
any
measures
taken
to
blockade
him
in
his
camp
and
so
to
extort
by
famine
that
submission
which
it
was
too
plainly
perilous
to
enforce
with
the
sword
attila
was
allowed
to
march
back
the
remnants
of
his
army
without
molestation
and
even
with
the
semblance
of
success
it
is
probable
that
the
crafty
aetius
was
unwilling
to
be
too
victorious
he
dreaded
the
glory
which
his
allies
the
visigoths
had
acquired
and
feared
that
rome
might
find
a
second
alaric
in
prince
thorismund
who
had
signalized
himself
in
the
battle
and
had
been
chosen
on
the
field
to
succeed
his
father
theodoric
he
persuaded
the
young
king
to
return
at
once
to
his
capital
and
thus
relieved
himself
at
the
same
time
of
the
presence
of
a
dangerous
friend
as
well
as
of
a
formidable
though
beaten
foe
attila
attacks
on
the
western
empire
were
soon
renewed
but
never
with
such
peril
to
the
civilized
world
as
had
menaced
it
before
his
defeat
at
chalons
and
on
his
death
two
years
after
that
battle
the
vast
empire
which
his
genius
had
founded
was
soon
dissevered
by
the
successful
revolts
of
the
subject
nations
the
name
of
the
huns
ceased
for
some
centuries
to
inspire
terror
in
western
europe
and
their
ascendency
passed
away
with
the
life
of
the
great
king
by
whom
it
had
been
so
fearfully
augmented
if
i
seem
to
have

civil
and
political
society
the
great
bulk
of
the
population
still
consisted
of
the
conquered
provincials
that
is
to
say
of
romanized
celts
of
a
gallic
race
which
had
long
been
under
the
dominion
of
the
caesars
and
had
acquired
together
with
no
slight
infusion
of
roman
blood
the
language
the
literature
the
laws
and
the
civilization
of
latium
among
these
and
dominant
over
them
roved
or
dwelt
the
german
victors
some
retaining
nearly
all
the
rude
independence
of
their
primitive
national
character
others
softened
and
disciplined
by
the
aspect
and
contact
of
the
manners
and
institutions
of
civilized
life
for
it
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
roman
empire
in
the
west
was
not
crushed
by
any
sudden
avalanche
of
barbaric
invasion
the
german
conquerors
came
across
the
rhine
not
in
enormous
hosts
but
in
bands
of
a
few
thousand
warriors
at
a
time
the
conquest
of
a
province
was
the
result
of
an
infinite
series
of
partial
local
invasions
carried
on
by
little
armies
of
this
description
the
victorious
warriors
either
retired
with
their
booty
or
fixed
themselves
in
the
invaded
district
taking
care
to
keep
sufficiently
concentrated
for
military
purposes
and
ever
ready
for
some
fresh
foray
either
against
a
rival
teutonic
band
or
some
hitherto
unassailed
city
of
the
provincials
gradually
however
the
conquerors
acquired
a
desire
for
permanent
landed
possessions
they
lost
somewhat
of
the
restless
thirst
for
novelty
and
adventure
which
had
first
made
them
throng
beneath
the
banner
of
the
boldest
captains
of
their
tribe
and
leave
their
native
forests
for
a
roving
military
life
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
they
were
converted
to
the
christian
faith
and
gave
up
with
their
old
creed
much
of
the
coarse
ferocity
which
must
have
been
fostered
in
the
spirits
of
the
ancient
warriors
of
the
north
by
a
mythology
which
promised
as
the
reward
of
the
brave
on
earth
an
eternal
cycle
of
fighting
and
drunkenness
in
heaven
but
although
their
conversion
and
other
civilizing
influences
operated
powerfully
upon
the
germans
in
gaul
and
although
the
franks
who
were
originally
a
confederation
of
the
teutonic
tribes
that
dwelt
between
the
rhine
the
maine
and
the
weser
established
a
decided
superiority
over
the
other
conquerors
of
the
province
as
well
as
over
the
conquered
provincials
the
country
long
remained
a
chaos
of
uncombined
and
shifting
elements
the
early
princes
of
the
merovingian
dynasty
were
generally
occupied
in
wars
against
other
princes
of
their
house
occasioned
by
the
frequent
subdivisions
of
the
frank
monarchy
and
the
ablest
and
best
of
them
had
found
all
their
energies
tasked
to
the
utmost
to
defend
the
barrier
of
the
rhine
against
the
pagan
germans
who
strove
to
pass
that
river
and
gather
their
share
of
the
spoils
of
the
empire
the
conquests
which
the
saracens
effected
over
the
southern
and
eastern
provinces
of
rome
were
far
more
rapid
than
those
achieved
by
the
germans
in
the
north
and
the
new
organizations
of
society
which
the
moslems
introduced
were
summarily
and
uniformly
enforced
exactly
a
century
passed
between
the
death
of
mohammed
and
the
date
of
the
battle
of
tours
during
that
century
the
followers
of
the
prophet
had
torn
away
half
the
roman
empire
and
besides
their
conquests
over
persia
the
saracens
had
overrun
syria
egypt
africa
and
spain
in
an
unchequered
and
apparently
irresistible
career
of
victory
nor
at
the
commencement
of
the
eighth
century
of
our
era
was
the
mohammedan
world
divided
against
itself
as
it
subsequently
became

these
vast
regions

the
caliph
throughout
them
all
from
the
pyrenees
to

the

of

invoked
in

the

the

it
is
not

by

but
by

also
that
these
feelings
of
ambition
and
arrogance
are
attributed
to
the
moslems
who
had
overthrown
the
visigoth
power
in

and
their
eager
expectations
of

were
excited

of
that
country
which
restored

a
general
who
had
signalized
his
skill
and
prowess
during
the
conquests
of
africa
and
spain
whose
ready
valour
and
generosity
had
made
him
the
idol
of
the
troops
who
had
already
been
engaged
in
several
expeditions
into
gaul
so
as
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
national
character
and
tactics
of
the
franks
and
who
was
known
to
thirst
like
a
good
moslem
for
revenge
for
the
slaughter
of
some
detachments
of
the
true
believers
which
had
been
cut
off
on
the
north
of
the
pyrenees
in
addition
to
his
cardinal
military
virtues
abderrahman
is
described
by
the
arab
writers
as
a
model
of
integrity
and
justice
the
first
two
years
of
his
second
administration
in
spain
were
occupied
in
severe
reforms
of
the
abuses
which
under
his
predecessors
had
crept
into
the
system
of
government
and
in
extensive
preparations
for
his
intended
conquest
of
gaul
besides
the
troops
which
he
collected
from
his
province
he
obtained
from
africa
a
large
body
of
chosen
barber
cavalry
officered
by
arabs
of
proved
skill
and
valour
and
in
the
summer
of
he
crossed
the
pyrenees
at
the
head
of
an
army
which
some
arab
writers
rate
at
eighty
thousand
strong
while
some
of
the
christian
chroniclers
swell
its
numbers
to
many
hundreds
of
thousands
more
probably
the
arab
account
diminishes
but
of
the
two
keeps
nearer
to
the
truth
it
was
from
this
formidable
host
after
eudes
the
count
of
acquitaine
had
vainly
striven
to
check
it
after
many
strong
cities
had
fallen
before
it
and
half
the
land
been
overrun
that
gaul
and
christendom
were
at
last
rescued
by
the
strong
arm
of
prince
charles
who
acquired
a
surname
martel

see
the
scandinavian
sagas

an
account
of
the
favourite

that
of
the
of
his

creed
from
the
might
with
which
he
broke
and
shattered
his
enemies
in
the
battle
the
merovingian
kings
had
sunk
into
absolute
insignificance
and
had
become
mere
puppets
of
royalty
before
the
eighth
century
charles
martel
like
his
father
pepin
heristal
was
duke
of
the
austrasian
franks
the
bravest
and
most
thoroughly
germanic
part
of
the
nation
and
exercised
in
the
name
of
the
titular
king
what
little
paramount
authority
the
turbulent
minor
rulers
of
districts
and
towns
could
be
persuaded
or
compelled
to
acknowledge
engaged
with
his
national
competitors
in
perpetual
conflicts
for
power
engaged
also
in
more
serious
struggles
for
safety
against
the
fierce
tribes
of
the
unconverted
frisians
bavarians
saxons
and
thuringians
who
at
that
epoch
assailed
with
peculiar
ferocity
the
christianized
germans
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
charles
martel
added
experienced
skill
to
his
natural
courage
and
he
had
also
formed
a
militia
of
veterans
among
the
franks
hallam
has
thrown
out
a
doubt
whether
in
our
admiration
of
his
victory
at
tours
we
do
not
judge
a
little
too
much
by
the
event
and
whether
there
was
not
rashness
in
his
risking
the
fate
of
france
on
the
result
of
a
general
battle
with
the
invaders
but
when
we
remember
that
charles
had
no
standing
army
and
the
independent
spirit
of
the
frank
warriors
who
followed
his
standard
it
seems
most
probable
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
adopt
the
cautious
policy
of
watching
the
invaders
and
wearing
out
their
strength
by
delay
so
dreadful
and
so
were
the
ravages
of
the
saracenic
light
cavalry
throughout
gaul
that
it
must
have
been
impossible
to
restrain
for
any
length
of
time
the
indignant
ardour
of
the
franks
and
even
if
charles
could
have
persuaded
his
men
to
look
tamely
on
while
the
arabs
stormed
more
towns
and
desolated
more
districts
he
could
not
have
kept
an
army
together
when
the
usual
period
of
a
military
expedition
had
expired
if
indeed
the
arab
account
of
the
disorganization
of
the
moslem
forces
be
correct
the
battle
was
as
on
the
part
of
charles
as
it
was
beyond
all
question
the
monkish
chroniclers
from
whom
we
are
obliged
to
glean
a
narrative
of
this
memorable
campaign
bear
full
evidence
to
the
terror
which
the
saracen
invasion
inspired
and
to
the
agony
of
that
great
struggle
the
saracens
say
they
and
their
king
who
was
called
abdirames
came
out
of
spain
with
all
their
wives
and
their
children
and
their
substance
in
such
great
multitudes
that
no
man
could
reckon
or
estimate
them
they
brought
with
them
all
their
armour
and
whatever
they
had
as
if
they
were

dispersed

interposition

i
have
translated
above
some
of
the
most
spirited
passages
of
these
writers
but
it
is
impossible
to
collect
from
them
anything
like
a
full
or
authentic
description
of
the
great
battle
itself
or
of
the
operations
which
preceded
or
followed
it
though
however
we
may
have
cause
to
regret
the
meagreness
and
doubtful
character
of
these
narratives
we
have
the
great
advantage
of
being
able
to
compare
the
accounts
given
of
abderrahman
expedition
by
the
national
writers
of
each
side
this
is
a
benefit
which
the
inquirer
into
antiquity
so
seldom
can
obtain
that
the
fact
of
possessing
it
in
the
instance
of
the
battle
of
tours
makes
us
think
the
historical
testimony
respecting
that
great
event
more
certain
and
satisfactory
than
is
the
case
in
many
other
instances
where
we
possess
abundant
details
respecting
military
exploits
but
where
those
details
come
to
us
from
the
annalist
of
one
nation
only
and
where
we
have
consequently
no
safeguard
against
the
exaggerations
the
distortions
and
the
fictions
which
national
vanity
has
so
often
put
forth
in
the
garb
and
under
the
title
of
history
the
arabian
writers
who
recorded
the
conquests
and
wars
of
their
countrymen
in
spain
have
narrated
also
the
expedition
into
gaul
of
their
great
emir
and
his
defeat
and

plan
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
follow
was
to
present
both
the
style
and
spirit
of
his
oriental
authorities
so
that
we
find
in
his
pages
a
genuine
saracenic
narrative
of
the
wars
in
western
europe
between
the
mahommedans
and
the
christians
they
tell
us
how
there
was
war
between
the
count
of
the
frankish
frontier
and
the
moslems
and
how
the
count
gathered
together
all
his
people
and
fought
for
a
time
with
doubtful
success
but
say
the
arabian
chroniclers
abderrahman
drove
them
back
and
the
men
of
abderrahman
were
puffed
up
in
spirit
by
their
repeated
successes
and
they
were
full
of
trust
in
the
valour
and
the
practice
in
war
of
their
emir
so
the
moslems
smote
their
enemies
and
passed
the
river
garonne
and
laid
waste
the
country
and
took
captives
without
number
and
that
army
went
through
all
places
like
a
desolating
storm
prosperity
made
those
warriors
insatiable
at
the
passage
of
the
river
abderrahman
overthrew
the
count
and
the
count
retired
into
his
stronghold
but
the
moslems
fought
against
it
and
entered
it
by
force
and
slew
the
count
for
everything
gave
way
to
their
scimetars
which
were
the
robbers
of
lives
all
the
nations
of
the
franks
trembled
at
that
terrible
army
and
they
betook
them
to
their
king
caldus
and
told
him
of
the
havoc
made
by
the
moslem
horsemen
and
how
they
rode
at
their
will
through
all
the
land
of
narbonne
toulouse
and
bordeaux
and
they
told
the
king
of
the
death
of
their
count
then
the
king
bade
them
be
of
good
cheer
and
offered
to
aid
them
and
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
he
mounted
his
home
and
he
took
with
him
a
host
that
could
not
be
numbered
and
went
against
the
moslems
and
he
came
upon
them
at
the
great
city
of
tours
and
abderrahman
and
other
prudent
cavaliers
saw
the
disorder
of
the
moslem
troops
who
were
loaded
with
spoil
but
they
did
not
venture
to
displease
the
soldiers
by
ordering
them
to
abandon
everything
except
their
arms
and
and
abderrahman
trusted
in
the
valour
of
his
soldiers
and
in
the
good
fortune
which
had
ever
attended
him
but
the
arab
writer
remarks
such
defect
of
discipline
always
is
fatal
to
armies
so
abderrahman
and
his
host
attacked
tours
to
gain
still
more
spoil
and
they
fought
against
it
so
fiercely
that
they
stormed
the
city
almost
before
the
eyes
of
the
army
that
came
to
save
it
and
the
fury
and
the
cruelty
of
the
moslems
towards
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
were
like
the
fury
and
cruelty
of
raging
tigers
it
was
manifest
adds
the
arab
that
god
chastisement
was
sure
to
follow
such
excesses
and
fortune

the

the
two
great
hosts

set
in
array
against

other
the
hearts
of
abderrahman
his
captains
and
his
men
were
filled
with
wrath
and
pride
and
they
were
the
first
to
begin
the
fight
the
moslem
horseman
dashed
fierce
and
frequent
forward
against
the
battalions
of
the
franks
who
resisted
manfully
and
many
fell
dead
on
either
side
until
the
going
down
of
the
sun
night
parted
the
two
armies
but
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
the
moslems
returned
to
the
battle
their
cavaliers
had
soon
hewn
their
way
into
the
centre
of
the
christian
host
but
many
of
the
moslems
were
fearful
for
the
safety
of
the
spoil
which
they
had
stored
in
their
tents
and
a
false
cry
arose
in
their
ranks
that
some
of
the
enemy
were
plundering
the
camp
whereupon
several
squadrons
of
the
moslem
horseman
rode
off
to
protect
their
tents
but
it
seemed
as
if
they
fled
and
all
the
host
was
troubled
and
while
abderrahman
strove
to
check
their
tumult
and
to
lead
them
back
to
battle
the
warriors
of
the
franks
came
around
him
and
he
was
pierced
through
with
many
spears
so
that
he
died
then
all
the
host
fled
before
the
enemy
and
many
died
in
the
flight
this
deadly
defeat
of
the
moslems
and
the
loss
of
the
great
leader
and
good
cavalier
abderrahman
took
place
in
the
hundred
and
fifteenth
year
it
would
be
difficult
to
expect
from
an
adversary
a
more
explicit
confession
of
having
been
thoroughly
vanquished
than
the
arabs
here
accord
to
the
europeans
the
points
on
which
their
narrative
differs
from
those
of
the
christians
as
to
how
many
days
the
conflict
lasted
whether
the
assailed
city
was
actually
rescued
or
not
and
the
like
are
of
little
moment
compared
with
the
admitted
great
fact
that
there
was
a
decisive
trial
of
strength
between
frank
and
saracen
in
which
the
former
conquered
the
enduring
importance
of
the
battle
of
tours
in
the
eyes
of
the
moslems
is
attested
not
only
by
the
expressions
of
the
deadly
battle
and
the
disgraceful
overthrow
which
their
writers
constantly
employ
when
referring
to
it
but
also
by
the
fact
that
no
further
serious
attempts
at
conquest
beyond
the
pyrenees
were
made

the
saracens

in

the

it

upon

will
ever

that

as
one
of
secondary
importance
it
is
true
that
in
the
last
century
some
writers
of
eminence
on
our
history
and
laws
mentioned
the
norman
conquest
in
terms
from
which
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
battle
of
hastings
led
to
little
more
than
the
substitution
of
one
royal
family
for
another
on
the
throne
of
this
country
and
to
the
garbling
and
changing
of
some
of
our
laws
through
the
cunning
of
the
norman
lawyers
but
at
least
since
the
appearance
of
the
work
of
augustin
thierry
on
the
norman
conquest
these
forensic
fallacies
have
been
exploded
thierry
made
his
readers
keenly
appreciate
the
magnitude
of
that
political
and
social
catastrophe
he
depicted
in
vivid
colours
the
atrocious
cruelties
of
the
conquerors
and
the
sweeping
and
enduring
innovations
that
they
wrought
involving
the
overthrow
of
the
ancient
constitution
as
well
as
of
the
last
of
the
saxon
kings
in
his
pages
we
see
new
tribunals
and
tenures
superseding
the
old
ones
new
divisions
of
race
and
class
introduced
whole
districts
devastated
to
gratify
the
vengeance
or
the
caprice
of
the
new
tyrant
the
greater
part
of
the
lands
of
the
english
confiscated
and
divided
among
aliens
the
very
name
of
englishmen
turned
into
a
reproach
the
english
language
rejected
as
servile
and
barbarous
and
all
the
high
places
in
church
and
state
for
upwards
of
a
century
filled
exclusively
by
men
of
foreign
race
no
less
true
than
eloquent
is
thierry
summing
up
of
the
social
effects
of
the
norman
conquest
on
the
generation
that
witnessed
it
and
on
many
of
their
successors
he
tells
his
reader
that
if
he
would
form
a
just
idea
of
england
conquered
by
william
of
normandy
he
must
figure
to
himself
not
a
mere
change
of
political
rule
not
the
triumph
of
one
candidate
over
another
candidate
of
the
man
of
one
party
over
the
man
of
another
party
but
the
intrusion
of
one
people
into
the
bosom
of
another
people
the
violent
placing
of
one
society
over
another
society
which
it
came
to
destroy
and
the
scattered
fragments
of
which
it
retained
only
as
personal
property
or
to
use
the
words
of
an
old
act
as
clothing
of
the
soil
he
must
not
picture
to
himself
on
the
one
hand
william
a
king
and
a
despot
on
the
other
subjects
of
william
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
all
inhabiting
england
and
consequently
all
english
but
he
must
imagine
two
nations
of
one
of
which
william
is
a
member
and
the
chief
two
nations
which
if
the
term
must
be
used
were
both
subject
to
william
but
as
applied
to
which
the
word
has
quite
different
senses
meaning
in
the
one
case
subordinate
in
the
other
subjugated
he
must
consider
that
there
are
two
countries
two
soils
included
in
the
same
geographical
circumference
that
of
the
normans
rich
and
free
that
of
the
saxons
poor
and
serving
vexed
by
rent
and
taillage
the
former
full
of
spacious
mansions
and
walled
and
moated
castles
the
latter
scattered
over
with
huts
and
straw
and
ruined
hovels
that
peopled
with
the
happy
and
the
idle
with
men
of
the
army
and
of
the
court
with
knights
and
nobles
this
with
men
of
pain
and
labour
with
farmers
and
artizans
on
the
one
side
luxury
and
insolence
on
the
other
misery
and
envy
not
the
envy
of
the
poor
at
the
sight
of
opulence
they
can
not
reach
but
the
envy
of
the
despoiled
when
in
presence
of
the
despoilers
perhaps
the
effect
of
thierry
work
has
been
to
cast
into
the
shade
the
ultimate
good
effects
on
england
of
the
norman
conquest
yet
these
are
as
undeniable
as
are
the
miseries
which
that
conquest
inflicted
on
our
saxon
ancestors
from
the
time
of
the
battle
of
hastings
to
the
time
of
the
signing
of
the
great
charter
at
runnymede
that
last
is
the
true
epoch
of
english
nationality
it
is
the
epoch
when
and
ceased
to
keep
aloof
from
each
other
the
one
in
haughty
scorn
the
other
in
sullen
abhorrence
and
when
all
the
free
men
of
the
land
whether
barons
knights
yeomen
or
burghers
combined
to
lay
the
foundations
of
english
freedom
our
norman
barons
were
the
chiefs
of
that
primary
constitutional
movement
those
iron
barons
whom
chatham
has
so
nobly
eulogized
this
alone
should
make
england
remember
her
obligations
to
the
norman
conquest
which
planted
far
and
wide
as
a
dominant
class
in
her
land
a
martial
nobility
of
the
bravest
and
most
energetic
race
that
ever
existed
it
may
sound
paradoxical
but
it
is
in
reality
no
exaggeration
to
say
with
guizot
essais
sur
de
france
et
seq
that
england
owes
her
liberties
to
her
having
been
conquered
by
the
normans
it
is
true
that
the
saxon
institutions
were
the
primitive
cradle
of
english
liberty
but
by
their
own
intrinsic
force
they
could
never
have
founded
the
enduring
free
english
constitution
it
was
the
conquest
that
infused
into
them
a
new
virtue
and
the
political
liberties
of
england
arose
from
the
situation
in
which
the
and
the
populations
and
laws
found
themselves
placed
relatively
to
each
other
in
this
island
the
state
of
england
under
her
last
kings
closely
resembled
the
state
of
france
under
the
last
carlovingian
and
the
first
capetian
princes
the
crown
was
feeble
the
great
nobles
were
strong
and
turbulent
and
although
there
was
more
national
unity
in
saxon
england
than
in
france
although
the
english
local
free
institutions
had
more
reality
and
energy
than
was
the
case
with
anything
analogous
to
them
on
the
continent
in
the
eleventh
century
still
the
probability
is
that
the
saxon
system
of
polity
if
left
to
itself
would
have
fallen
into
utter
confusion
out
of
which
would
have
arisen
first
an
aristocratic
hierarchy
like
that
which
arose
in
france
next
an
absolute
monarchy
and
finally
a

of
anarchical
revolutions

as

with

and
our
abhorrence
of
the

of

of

we
must
confess
the
superiority
of
the
normans
to
the
and
whom
they
met
here
in
as
well
as
to
the
degenerate
frank
noblesse
and
the
crushed
and
servile
romanesque
provincials
from
whom
in
they
had
wrested
the
district
in
the
north
of
gaul
which
still
bears
the
name
of
normandy
it
was
not
merely
by
extreme
valour
and
ready
subordination
or
military
discipline
that
the
normans
were
among
all
the
conquering
races
of
the
gothic
stock
but
also
by
their
instinctive
faculty
of
appreciating
and
adopting
the
superior
civilizations
which
they
encountered
thus
duke
rollo
and
his
scandinavian
warriors
readily
embraced
the
creed
the
language
the
laws
and
the
arts
which
france
in
those
troubled
and
evil
times
with
which
the
capetian
dynasty
commenced
still
inherited
from
imperial
rome
and
imperial
charlemagne
they
adopted
the
customs
the
duties
the
obedience
that
the
capitularies
of
emperors
and
kings
had
established
but
that
which
they
brought
to
the
application
of
those
laws
was
the
spirit
of
life
the
spirit
of
liberty
the
habits
also
of
military
subordination
and
the
aptness
for
a
state
politic
which
could
reconcile
the

of

veins
small
had
been
the
figure
which
england
made
in
the
world
before
the
coming
over
of
the
normans
and
without
them
she
never
would
have
emerged
from
insignificance
the
authority
of
gibbon
may
be
taken
as
decisive
when
he
pronounces
that
assuredly
england
was
a
gainer
by
the
conquest
and
we
may
proudly
adopt
the
comment
of
the
frenchman
rapin
who
writing
of
the
battle
of
hastings
more
than
a
century
ago
speaks
of
the
revolution
effected
by
it
as
the
first
step
by
which
england
has
arrived
to
that
height
of
grandeur
and
glory
we
behold
it
in
at
present
rapin
hist
england
see

sharon

vol

and
above
all
palgrave
normandy
and
england
the
interest
of
this
eventful
struggle
by
which
william
of
normandy
became
king
of
england
is
materially
enhanced
by
the
high
personal
characters
of
the
competitors
for
our
crown
they
were
three
in
number
one
was
a
foreign
prince
from
the
north
one
was
a
foreign
prince
from
the
south
and
one
was
a
native
hero
of
the
land
harald
hardrada
the
strongest
and
the
most
chivalric
of
the
kings
of
norway
was
the
first
see
in
snerre
the
saga
of
harald
hardrada
duke
william
of
normandy
was
the
second
and
the
saxon
harold
the
son
of
earl
godwin
was
the
third
never
was
a
nobler
prize
sought
by
nobler
champions
or
striven
for
more
gallantly
the
saxon
triumphed
over
the
norwegian
and
the
norman
triumphed
over
the
saxon
but
norse
valour
was
never
more
conspicuous
than
when
harald
hardrada
and
his
host
fought
and
fell
at
stamford
bridge
nor
did
saxons
ever
face
their
foes
more
bravely
than
our
harold
and
his
men
on
the
fatal
day
of
hastings
during
the
reign
of
king
edward
the
confessor
over
this
land
the
claims
of
the
norwegian
king
to
our
crown
were
little
thought
of
and
though
hardrada
predecessor
king
magnus
of
norway
had
on
one
occasion
asserted
that
by
virtue
of
a
compact
with
our
former
king
hardicanute
he
was
entitled
to
the
english
throne
no
serious
attempt
had
been
made
to
enforce
his
pretensions
but
the
rivalry
of
the
saxon
harold
and
the
norman
william
was
foreseen
and
bewailed
by
the
confessor
who
was
believed
to
have
predicted
on
his
the
calamities
that
were
pending
over
england
duke
william
was
king
edward
kinsman
harold
was
the
head
of
the
most
powerful
noble
house
next
to
the
royal
blood
in
england
and
personally
he
was
the
bravest
and
most
popular
chieftain
in
the
land
king
edward
was
childless
and
the
nearest
collateral
heir
was
a
puny
unpromising
boy
england
had
suffered
too
severely
during
royal
minorities
to
make
the
accession
of
edgar
atheling
desirable
and
long
before
king
edward
death
earl
harold
was
the
destined
king
of
the
nation
choice
though
the
favour
of
the
confessor
was
believed
to
lean
towards
the
norman
duke
a
little
time
before
the
death
of
king
edward
harold
was
in
normandy
the
causes
of
the
voyage
of
the
saxon
earl
to
the
continent
are
doubtful
but
the
fact
of
his
having
been
in
at
the
ducal
court
and
in
the
power
of
his
rival
is
indisputable
william
made
skilful
and
unscrupulous
use
of
the
opportunity
though
harold
was
treated
with
outward
courtesy
and
friendship
he
was
made
fully
aware
that
his
liberty
and
life
depended
on
his
compliance
with
the
duke
requests
william
said
to
him
in
apparent
confidence
and
cordiality
when
king
edward
and
i
once
lived
like
brothers
under
the
same
roof
he
promised
that
if
ever
he
became
king
of
england
he
would
make
me
heir
to
his
throne
harold
i
wish
that
thou
wouldst
assist
me
to
realize
this
promise
harold
replied
with
expressions
of
assent
and
further
agreed
at
william
request
to
marry
william
daughter
adela
and
to
send
over
his
own
sister
to
be
married
to
one
of
william
barons
the
crafty
norman
was
not
content
with
this
extorted
promise
he
determined
to
bind
harold
by
a
more
solemn
pledge
which
if
broken
would
be
a
weight
on
the
spirit
of
the
gallant
saxon
and
a
discouragement
to
others
from
adopting
his
cause
before
a
full
assembly
of
the
norman
barons
harold
was
required
to
do
homage
to
duke
william
as
the
of
the
english
crown
kneeling
down
harold
placed
his
hands
between
those
of
the
duke
and
repeated
the
solemn
form
by
which
he
acknowledged
the
duke
as
his
lord
and
promised
to
him
fealty
and
true
service
but
william
exacted
more
he
had
caused
all
the
bones
and
relics
of
saints
that
were
preserved
in
the
norman
monasteries
and
churches
to
be
collected
into
a
chest
which
was
placed
in
the
covered
over
with
a
cloth
of
gold
on
the
chest
of
relics
which
were
thus
concealed
was
laid
a
missal
the
duke
then
solemnly
addressed
his
titular
guest
and
real
captive
and
said
to
him
harold
i
require
thee
before
this
noble
assembly
to
confirm
by
oath
the
promises
which
thou
hast
made
me
to
assist
me
in
obtaining
the
crown
of
england
after
king
edward
death
to
marry
my
daughter
adela
and
to
send
me
thy
sister
that
i
may
give
her
in
marriage
to
one
of
my
barons
harold
once
more
taken
by
surprise
and
not
able
to
deny
his
former
words
approached
the
missal
and
laid
his
hand
on
it
not
knowing
that
the
chest
of
relics
was
beneath
the
old
norman
chronicler
who
describes
the
scene
most
minutely
wace
roman
de
rou
i
have
nearly
followed
his
words
says
when
harold
placed
his
hand
on
it
the
hand
trembled
and
the
flesh
quivered
but
he
swore
and
promised
upon
his
oath
to
take
ele
adela
to
wife
and
to
deliver
up
england
to
the
duke
and
thereunto
to
do
all
in
his
power
according
to
his
might
and
wit
after
the
death
of
edward
if
he
himself
should
live
so
help
him
god
many
cried
god
grant
it
and
when
harold
rose
from
his
knees
the
duke
made
him
stand
close
to
the
chest
and
took
off
the
pall
that
had
covered
it
and
showed
harold
upon
what
holy
relics
he
had
sworn
and
harold
was
sorely
alarmed
at
the
sight
harold
was
soon
after
this
permitted
to
return
to
england
and
after
a
short
interval
during
which
he
distinguished
himself
by
the
wisdom
and
humanity
with
which
he
pacified
some
formidable
tumults
of
the
in
northumbria
he
found
himself
called
on
to
decide
whether
he
would
keep
the
oath
which
the
norman
had
obtained
from
him
or
mount
the
vacant
throne
of
england
in
compliance
with
the
nation
choice
king
edward
the
confessor
died
on
the
of
january
and
on
the
following
day
an
assembly
of
the
thanes
and
prelates
present
in
london
and
of
the
citizens
metropolis
declared
that
harold
should
be
their
king
it
was
reported
that
the
dying
edward
had
nominated
him
as
his
successor
but
the
sense
which
his
countrymen
entertained
of
his
merit
was
the
true
foundation
of
his
title
to
the
crown
harold
resolved
to
disregard
the
oath
which
he
made
in
normandy
as
violent
and
void
and
on
the
day
of
that
january
he
was
anointed
king
of
england
and
received
from
the
archbishop
hands
the
golden
crown
and
sceptre
of
england
and
also
an
ancient
national
symbol
a
weighty
he
had
deep
and
speedy
need
of
this
significant
part
of
the
insignia
of
saxon
royalty
a
messenger
from
normandy
soon
arrived
to
remind
harold
of
the
oath
which
he
had
sworn
to
the
duke
with
his
mouth
and
his
hand
upon
good
and
holy
relics
it
is
true
replied
the
saxon
king
that
i
took
an
oath
to
william
but
i
took
it
under
constraint
i
promised
what
did
not
belong
to
me
what
i
could
not
in
any
way
hold
my
royalty
is
not
my
own
i
could
not
lay
it
down
against
the
will
of
the
country
nor
can
i
against
the
will
of
the
country
take
a
foreign
wife
as
for
my
sister
whom
the
duke
claims
that
he
may
marry
her
to
one
of
his
chiefs
she
has
died
within
the
year
would
he
have
me
send
her
corpse
william
sent
another
message
which
met
with
a
similar
answer
and
then
the
duke
published
far
and
wide
through
christendom
what
he
termed
the
perjury
and
bad
faith
of
his
rival
and
proclaimed
his
intention
of
asserting
his
rights
by
the
sword
before
the
year
should
expire
and
of
pursuing
and
punishing
the
perjurer
even
in
those
places
where
he
thought
he
stood
most
strongly
and
most
securely
before
however
he
commenced
hostilities
william
with
deep
laid
policy
submitted
his
claims
to
the
decision
of
the
pope
harold
refused
to
acknowledge
this
tribunal
or
to
answer
before
an
italian
priest
for
his
title
as
an
english
king
after
a
formal
examination
of
complaints
by
the
pope
and
the
cardinals
it
was
solemnly
adjudged
at
rome
that
england
belonged
to
the
norman
duke
and
a
banner
was
sent
to
william
from
the
holy
see
which
the
pope
himself
had
consecrated
and
blessed
for
the
invasion
of
this
island
the
clergy
throughout
the
continent
were
now
assiduous
and
energetic
in
preaching
up
enterprise
as
undertaken
in
the
cause
of
god
besides
these
spiritual
arms
the
effect
of
which
in
the
eleventh
century
must
not
be
measured
by
the
philosophy
or
the
indifferentism
of
the
nineteenth
the
norman
duke
applied
all
the
energies
of
his
mind
and
body
all
the
resources
of
his
duchy
and
all
the
influence
he
possessed
among
vassals

all
the

to

william
the
most
renowned
knight
and
sagest
general
of
the
age
promised
to
lead
them
to
glory
and
wealth
in
the
fair
domains
of
england
his
army
was
filled
with
the
chivalry
of
continental
europe
all
eager
to
save
their
souls
by
fighting
at
the
pope
bidding
ardent
to
signalise
their
valour
in
so
great
an
enterprise
and
longing
also
for
the
pay
and
the
plunder
which
william
liberally
promised
but
the
normans
themselves
were
the
pith
and
the
flower
of
the
army
and
william
himself
was
the
strongest

sagest
and
fiercest
spirit
of

and
the

with
which
he
hoped
to
crush
the
southern
invaders
but
the
unexpected
attack
of
king
harald
hardrada
of
norway
upon
another
part
of
england
disconcerted
the
skilful
measures
which
the

had
taken
against
the
menacing

william
harold
renegade
brother
earl
tostig
had
excited
the
norse
king
to
this
enterprise
the
importance
of
which
has
naturally
been
eclipsed
by
the
superior
interest
attached
to
the
victorious
expedition
of
duke
william
but
which
was
on
a
scale
of
grandeur
which
the
scandinavian
ports
had
rarely
if
ever
before
witnessed
hardrada
fleet
consisted
of
two
hundred
and
three
hundred
other

and
all
the
best
warriors
of

were
in
his
host
he
sailed
first
to
the
orkneys
where
many
of
the
islanders
joined
him
and
then
to
yorkshire
after
a
severe
conflict
near
york
he
completely
routed
earls
edwin
and
morcar
the
governors
of
northumbria
the
city
of
york
opened
its
gates
and
all
the
country
from
the
tyne
to
the
humber
submitted
to
him
the
tidings
of
the
defeat
of
edwin
and
morcar
compelled
harold
to
leave
his
position
an
the
southern
coast
and
move
instantly
against
the
norwegians
by
a
remarkably
rapid
march
he
reached
yorkshire
in
four
days
and
took
the
norse
king
and
his
confederates
by
surprise
nevertheless
the
battle
which
ensued
and
which
was
fought
near
stamford
bridge
was
desperate
and
was
long
doubtful
unable
to
break
the
ranks
of
the
norwegian
phalanx
by
force
harold
at
length
tempted
them
to
quit
their
close
order
by
a
pretended
flight
then
the
english
columns
burst
in
among
them
and
a
carnage
ensued
the
extent
of
which
may
be
judged
of
by
the
exhaustion
and
inactivity
of
norway
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
afterwards
king
harald
hardrada
and
all
the
flower
of
his
nobility
perished
on
the
of
september
at
stamford
bridge
a
battle
which
was
a
flodden
to
norway
harold
victory
was
splendid
but
he
had
bought
it
dearly
by
the
fall
of
many
of
his
best
officers
and
men
and
still
more
dearly
by
the
opportunity
which
duke
william
had
gained
of
effecting
an
unopposed
landing
on
the
sussex
coast
the
whole
of
william
shipping
had
assembled
at
the
mouth
of
the
dive
a
little
river
between
the
seine
and
the
orme
as
early
as
the
middle
of
august
the
army
which
he
had
collected
amounted
to
fifty
thousand
knights
and
ten
thousand
soldiers
of
inferior
degree
many
of
the
knights
were
mounted
but
many
must
have
served
on
foot
as
it
is
hardly
possible
to
believe
that
william
could
have
found
transports
for
the
conveyance
of
fifty
thousand
across
the
channel
for
a
long
time
the
winds
were
adverse
and
the
duke
employed
the
interval
that
passed
before
he
could
set
sail
in
completing
the
organization
and
in
improving
the
discipline
of
his
army
which
he
seems
to
have
brought
into
the
same
state
of
perfection
as
was
seven
centuries
and
a
half
afterwards
the
boast
of
another
army
assembled
on
the
same
coast
and
which
napoleon
designed
but
providentially
in
vain
for
a
similar
descent
upon
england
it
was
not
till
the
approach
of
the
equinox
that
the
wind
veered
from
the
to
the
west
and
gave
the
normans
an
opportunity
of
quitting
the
weary
shores
of
the
dive
they
eagerly
embarked
and
set
sail
but
the
wind
soon
freshened
to
a
gale
and
drove
them
along
the
french
coast
to
valery
where
the
greater
part
of
them
found
shelter
but
many
of
their
vessels
were
wrecked
and
the
whole
coast
of
normandy
was
strewn
with
the
bodies
of
the
drowned
william
army
began
to
grow
discouraged
and
averse
to
the
enterprise
which
the
very
elements
thus
seemed
to
fight
against
though
in
reality
the
wind
which
had
cooped
them
so
long
at
the
mouth
of
the
dive
and
the
western
gale
which
had
forced
them
into
valery
were
the
best
possible
friends
to
the
invaders
they
prevented
the
normans
from
crossing
the
channel
until
the
saxon
king
and
his
army
of
defence
had
been
called
away
from
the
sussex
coast
to
encounter
harald
hardrada
in
yorkshire
and
also
until
a
formidable
english
fleet
which
by
king
harold
orders
had
been
cruising
in
the
channel
to
intercept
the
normans
had
been
obliged
to
disperse
temporarily
for
the
purpose
of
refitting
and
taking
in
fresh
stores
of
provisions
duke
william
used
every
expedient
to
the
drooping
spirits
of
his
men
at
valery
and
at
last
he
caused
the
body
of
the
patron
saint
of
the
place
to
be
exhumed
and
carried
in
solemn
procession
while
the
whole
assemblage
of
soldiers
mariners
and
appurtenant
priests
implored
the
saint
intercession
for
a
change
of
wind
that
very
night
the
wind
veered
and
enabled
the
mediaeval
agamemnon
to
quit
his
aulia
with
full
sails
and
a
following
southern
breeze
the
norman
armada
left
the
french
shores
and
steered
for
england
the
invaders
crossed
an
undefended
sea
and
found
an
undefended
coast
it
was
in
pevensey
bay
in
sussex
at
bulverhithe
between
the
castle
of
pevensey
and
hastings
that
the
last
conquerors
of
this
island
landed
on
the
of
september
harold
was
at
york
rejoicing
over
his
recent
victory
which
had
delivered
england
from
her
ancient
scandinavian
foes
and
resettling
the
government
of
the
counties
which
harald
hardrada
had
overrun
when
the
tidings
reached
him
that
duke
william
of
normandy
and
his
host
had
landed
on
the
sussex
shore
harold
instantly
hurried
southward
to
meet
this
enemy
the
severe
loss
which
his
army
had
sustained
in
the
battle
with
the
norwegians
must
have
made
it
impossible
for
any
large
number
of
veteran
troops
to
accompany
him
in
his
forced
march
to
london
and
thence
to
sussex
he
halted
at
the
capital
only
six
days
and
during
that
time
gave
orders
for
collecting
forces
from
his
southern
and
midland
counties
and
also
directed
his
fleet
to
reassemble
off
the
sussex
coast
harold
was
well
received
in
london
and
his
summons
to
arms
was
promptly
obeyed
by
citizen
by
thane
by
sokman
and
by
ceorl
for
he
had
shown
himself
during
his
brief
reign
a
just
and
wise
king
affable
to
all
men
active
for
the
good
of
his
country
and
in
the
words
of
the
old
historian
sparing
himself
from
no
fatigue
by
land
or
sea
see
roger
de
hoveden
and
william
of
malmesbury
cited
in
thierry
book
iii
he
might
have
gathered
a
much
more
numerous
force
than
that
of
william
but
his
recent
victory
had
made
him
and
he
was
irritated
by
the
reports
of
the
country
being
ravaged
by
the
invaders
as
soon
therefore
as
he
had
collected
a
small
army
in
london
he
marched
off
towards
the
coast
pressing
forward
as
rapidly
as
his
men
could
traverse
surrey
and
sussex
in
the
hope
of
taking
the
normans
unawares
as
he
had
recently
by
a
similar
forced
march
succeeded
in
surprising
the
norwegians
but
he
had
now
to
deal
with
a
foe
equally
brave
with
harald
hardrada
and
far
more
skilful
and
wary
the
old
norman
chroniclers
describe
the
preparations
of
william
on
his
landing
with
a
graphic
vigour
which
would
be
wholly
lost
by
transfusing
their
racy
norman
couplets
and
terse
latin
prose
into
the
current
style
of
modern
history
it
is
best
to
follow
them
closely
though
at
the
expense
of
much
quaintness
and
occasional
uncouthness
of
expression
they
tell
us
how
duke
william
own
ship
was
the
first
of
the
norman
fleet
it
was
called
the
mora
and
was
the
gift
of
his
duchess
matilda
on
the
head
of
the
ship
in
the
front
which
mariners
call
the
prow
there
was
a
brazen
child
bearing
an
arrow
with
a
bended
bow
his
face
was
turned
towards
england
and
thither
he
looked
as
though
he
was
about
to
shoot
the
breeze
became
soft
and
sweet
and
the
sea
was
smooth
for
their
landing
the
ships
ran
on
dry
land
and
each
ranged
by
the
other
side
there
you
might
see
the
good
sailors
the
sergeants
and
squires
sally
forth
and
unload
the
ships
cast
the
anchors
haul
the
ropes
bear
out
shields
and
saddles
and
land
the
and
palfreys
the
archers
came
forth
and
touched
land
the
first
each
with
his
bow
strong
and
with
his
quiver
full
of
arrows
slung
at
his
side
all
were
shaven
and
shorn
and
all
clad
in
short
garments
ready
to
attack
to
shoot
to
wheel
about
and
skirmish
all
stood
well
equipped
and
of
good
courage
for
the
fight
and
they
scoured
the
whole
shore
but
found
not
an
armed
man
there
after
the
archers
had
thus
gone
forth
the
knights
landed
all
armed
with
their
hauberks
on
their
shields
slung
at
their
necks
and
their
helmets
laced
they
formed
together
on
the
shore
each
armed
and
mounted
on
his
all
had
their
swords
girded
on
and
rode
forward
into
the
country
with
their
lances
raised
then
the
carpenters
landed
who
had
great
axes
in
their
hands
and
planes
and
adzes
hung
at
their
sides
they
took
counsel
together
and
sought
for
a
good
spot
to
place
a
castle
on
they
had
brought
with
them
in
the
fleet
three
wooden
castles
from
normandy
in
pieces
all
ready
for
framing
together
and
they
took
the
materials
of
one
of
these
out
of
the
ships
all
shaped
and
pierced
to
receive
the
pins
which
they
had
brought
cut
and
ready
in
large
barrels
and
before
evening
had
set
in
they
had
finished
a
good
fort
on
the
english
ground
and
there
they
placed
their
stores
all
then
ate
and
drank
enough
and
were
right
glad
that
they
were
ashore
when
duke
william
himself
landed
as
he
stepped
on
the
shore
he
slipped
and
fell
forward
upon
his
two
hands
forthwith
all
raised
a
loud
cry
of
distress
evil
sign
said
they
here
but
he
cried
out
lustily
my
lords
by
the
splendour
of
god
william
customary
oath
i
have
taken
possession
of
england
with
both
my
hands
it
is
now
mine
and
what
is
mine
is
yours
the
next
day
they
marched
along
the
to
hastings
near
that
place
the
duke
fortified
a
camp
and
set
up
the
two
other
wooden
castles
the
foragers
and
those
who
looked
out
for
booty
seized
all
the
clothing
and
provisions
they
could
find
lest
what
had
been
brought
by
the
ships
should
fail
them
and
the
english
were
to
be
seen
fleeing
before
them
driving
off
their
cattle
and
quitting
their
houses
many
took
shelter
in
and
even
there
they
were
in
grievous
alarm
besides
the
marauders
from
the
norman
camp
strong
bodies
of
cavalry
were
detached
by
william
into
the
country
and
these
when
harold
and
his
army
made
their
rapid
march
from
london
southward
fell
back
in
good
order
upon
the
main
body
of
the
normans
and
reported
that
the
saxon
king
was
rushing
on
like
a
madman
but
harold
when
he
found
that
his
hopes
of
surprising
his
adversary
were
vain
changed
his
tactics
and
halted
about
seven
miles
from
the
norman
lines
he
sent
some
spies
who
spoke
the
french
language
to
examine
the
number
and
preparations
of
the
enemy
who
on
their
return
related
with
astonishment
that
there
were
more
priests
in
william
camp
than
there
were
fighting
men
in
the
english
army
they
had
mistaken
for
priests
all
the
norman
soldiers
who
had
short
hair
and
shaven
chins
for
the
english
layman
were
then
accustomed
to
wear
long
hair
and
mustachios
harold
who
knew
the
norman
usages
smiled
at
their
words
and
said
those
whom
you
have
seen
in
such
numbers
are
not
priests
but
stout
soldiers
as
they
will
soon
make
us
feel
harold
army
was
far
inferior
in
number
to
that
of
the
normans
and
some
of
his
captains
advised
him
to
retreat
upon
london
and
lay
waste
the
country
so
as
to
starve
down
the
strength
of
the
invaders
the
policy
thus
recommended
was
unquestionably
the
wisest
for
the
saxon
fleet
had
now
reassembled
and
intercepted
all
william
communications
with
normandy
so
that
as
soon
as
his
stores
of
provisions
were
exhausted
he
must
have
moved
forward
upon
london
where
harold
at
the
head
of
the
full
military
strength
of
the
kingdom
could
have
defied
his
assault
and
probably
might
have
witnessed
his
rival
destruction
by
famine
and
disease
without
having
to
strike
a
single
blow
but
bold
blood
was
up
and
his
kindly
heart
could
not
endure
to
inflict
on
his
south
saxon
subjects
even
the
temporary
misery
of
wasting
the
country
he
would
not
burn
houses
and
villages
neither
would
he
take
away
the
substance
of
his
people
harold
brothers
gurth
and
leofwine
were
with
him
in
the
camp
and
gurth
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
absent
himself
from
the
battle
the
incident
shows
how
well
devised
had
been
william
scheme
of
binding
harold
by
the
oath
on
the
holy
relics
my
brother
said
the
young
saxon
prince
thou
canst
not
deny
that
either
by
force
or
thou
hast
made
duke
william
an
oath
on
the
bodies
of
saints
why
then
risk
thyself
in
the
battle
with
a
perjury
upon
thee
to
us
who
have
sworn
nothing
this
is
a
holy
and
a
just
war
for
we
are
fighting
for
our
country
leave
us
then
alone
to
fight
this
battle
and
he
who
has
the
right
will
win
harold
replied
that
he
would
not
look
on
while
others
risked
their
lives
for
him
men
would
hold
him
a
coward
and
blame
him
for
sending
his
best
friends
where
he
dared
not
go
himself
he
resolved
therefore
to
fight
and
to
fight
in
person
but
he
was
still
too
good
a
general
to
be
the
assailant
in
the
action
he
strengthened
his
position
on
the
hill
where
he
had
halted
by
a
palisade
of
stakes
interlaced
with
osier
hurdles
and
there
he
said
he
would
defend
himself
against
whoever
should
seek
him
the
ruins
of
battle
abbey
at
this
hour
attest
the
place
where
army
was
posted
the
high
altar
of
the
abbey
stood
on
the
very
spot
where
harold
own
standard
was
planted
during
the
fight
and
where
the
carnage
was
the
thickest
immediately
after
his
victory
william
vowed
to
build
an
abbey
on
the
site
and
a
fair
and
stately
pile
soon
rose
there
where
for
many
ages
the
monks
prayed
and
said
masses
for
the
souls
of
those
who
were
slain
in
the
battle
whence
the
abbey
took
its
name
before
that
time
the
place
was
called
senlac
little
of
the
ancient
edifice
now
remains
but
it
is
easy
to
trace
among
its
relics
and
in
the
neighbourhood
the
scenes
of
the
chief
incidents
in
the
action
and
it
is
impossible
to
deny
the
generalship
shown
by
harold
in
stationing
his
men
especially
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
he
was
deficient
in
cavalry
the
arm
in
which
his
adversary
main
strength
consisted
a
neck
of
hills
trends
inwards
for
nearly
seven
miles
from
the
high
ground
immediately
to
the
of
hastings
the
line
of
this
neck
of
hills
is
from
to
and
the
usual
route
from
hastings
to
london
must
in
ancient
as
in
modern
times
have
been
along
its
summits
at
the
distance
from
hastings
which
has
been
mentioned
the
continuous
chain
of
hills
ceases
a
valley
must
be
crossed
and
on
the
other
side
of
it
opposite
to
the
last
of
the
neck
of
hills
rises
a
high
ground
of
some
extent
facing
to
the
this
high
ground
then
termed
senlac
was
occupied
by
harold
army
it
could
not
be
attacked
in
front
without
considerable
disadvantage
to
the
assailants
and
could
hardly
be
turned
without
those
engaged
in
the
manoeuvre
exposing
themselves
to
a
fatal
charge
in
flank
while
they
wound
round
the
base
of
the
height
and
underneath
the
ridges
which
project
from
it
on
either
side
there
was
a
rough
and
district
in
the
rear
which
seemed
to
offer
harold
great
facilities
for
rallying
his
men
and
checking
the
progress
of
the
enemy
if
they
should
succeed
in
forcing
him
back
from
his
post
and
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
that
the
normans
if
they
met
with
any
repulse
could
save
themselves
from
utter
destruction
with
such
hopes
and
expectations
which
can
not
be
termed
unreasonable
though
successum
dea
dira
negavit
king
harold
bade
his
standard
be
set
up
a
little
way
down
the
slope
of
at
the
point
where
the
ascent
from
the
valley
was
least
steep
and
on
which
the
fiercest
attacks
of
the
advancing
enemy
were
sure
to
be
directed
the
of
the
high
altar
of
battle
abbey
have
during
late
years
been
discovered
and
we
may
place
our
feet
on
the
very
spot
where
harold
stood
with
england
banner
waving
over
him
where
when
the
battle
was
joined
he
defended
himself
to
the
utmost
where
the
fatal
arrow
came
down
on
him
where
he
leaned
in
agony
on
his
shield
and
where
at
last
he
was
beaten
to
the
earth
and
with
him
the
saxon
banner
was
beaten
down
like
him
never
to
rise
again
the
ruins
of
the
altar
are
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
high
road
which
leads
from
hastings
along
the
neck
of
hills
already
described
across
the
valley
and
through
the
modern
town
of
battle
towards
london
before
a
railway
was
made
along
this
valley
some
of
the
old
local
features
were
more
easy
than
now
to
recognise
the
eye
then
at
once
saw
that
the
ascent
from
the
valley
was
least
steep
at
the
point
which
harold
selected
for
his
own
post
in
the
engagement
but
this
is
still
sufficiently
discernible
and
we
can
fix
the
spot
a
little
lower
down
the
slope
immediately
in
front
of
the
high
altar
where
the
brave
kentish
men
stood
whose
right
it
was
to
strike
first
when
ever
the
king
went
to
battle
and
who
therefore
were
placed
where
the
normans
would
be
most
likely
to
make
their
first
charge
round
harold
himself
and
where
the
plantations
wave
which
now
surround
the
high
altar
ruins
stood
the
men
of
london
whose
privilege
it
was
to
guard
the
king
body
to
place
themselves
around
it
and
to
guard
his
standard
on
the
right
and
left
were
ranged
the
other
warriors
of
central
and
southern
england
whose
shires
the
old
norman
chronicler
distorts
in
his
french
nomenclature
looking
thence
in
the
direction
of
hastings
we
can
distinguish
the
ridge
of
the
rising
ground
over
which
the
normans
appeared
advancing
it
is
the
nearest
of
the
neck
of
hills
it
is
along
that
hill
that
harold
and
his
brothers
saw
approach
in
succession
the
three
divisions
of
the
norman
army
the
normans
came
down
that
slope
and
then
formed
in
the
valley
so
as
to
assault
the
whole
front
of
the
english
position
duke
william
own
division
with
the
best
men
and
greatest
strength
of
the
army
made
the
norman
centre
and
charged
the
english
immediately
in
front
of
harold
banner
as
the
nature
of
the
ground
had
led
the
saxon
king
to
anticipate
there
are
few
battles
the
localities
of
which
can
be
more
completely
traced
and
the
whole
scene
is
fraught
with
associations
of
deep
interest
but
the
spot
which
most
of
all
awakens
our
sympathy
and
excites
our
feelings
is
that
where
harold
himself
fought
and
fell
the
crumbling
fragments
of
the
grey
with
the
wild
flowers
that
cling
around
their
base
seem
fitting
memorials
of
the
brave
saxon
who
there
bowed
his
head
in
death
while
the
that
are
planted
near
and
wave
over
the
ruins
remind
us
of
the
conqueror
who
there
at
the
close
of
that
dreadful
day
reared
his
victorious
standard
high
over
the
trampled
banner
of
the
saxon
and
held
his
triumphant
carousal
amid
the
corses
of
the
slain
with
his
norman
chivalry
exulting
around
him
when
it
was
known
in
the
invaders
camp
at
hastings
that
king
harold
had
marched
southward
with
his
power
but
a
brief
interval
ensued
before
the
two
hosts
met
in
decisive
encounter
william
only
chance
of
safety
lay
in
bringing
on
a
general
engagement
and
he
joyfully
advanced
his
army
from
their
camp
on
the
hill
over
hastings
nearer
to
the
saxon
position
but
he
neglected
no
means
of
weakening
his
opponent
and
renewed
his
summonses
and
demands
on
harold
with
an
ostentatious
air
of
sanctity
and
moderation
a
monk
named
hugues
maigrot
came
in
william
name
to
call
upon
the
saxon
king
to
do
one
of
three
things
either
to
resign
his
royalty
in
favour
of
william
or
to
refer
it
to
the
arbitration
of
the
pope
to
decide
which
of
the
two
ought
to
be
king
or
to
let
it
be
determined
by
the
issue
of
a
single
combat
harold
abruptly
replied
will
not
resign
my
title
i
will
not
refer
it
to
the
pope
nor
will
i
accept
the
single
combat
he
was
far
from
being
deficient
in
bravery
but
he
was
no
more
at
liberty
to
stake
the
crown
which
he
had
received
from
a
whole
people
on
the
chance
of
a
duel
than
to
deposit
it
in
the
hands
of
an
italian
priest
william
was
not
at
all
ruffled
by
the
saxon
refusal
but
steadily
pursuing
the
course
of
his
calculated
measures
sent
the
norman
monk
again
after
giving
him
these
instructions
and
tell
harold
that
if
he
will
keep
his
former
compact
with
me
i
will
leave
to
him
all
the
country
which
is
beyond
the
humber
and
will
give
his
brother
gurth
all
the
lands
which
godwin
held
if
he
still
persist
in
refusing
my
offers
then
thou
shalt
tell
him
before
all
his
people
that
he
is
a
perjurer
and
a
liar
that
he
and
all
who
shall
support
him
are
excommunicated
by
the
mouth
of
the
pope
and
that
the
bull
to
that
effect
is
in
my
hands
hugues
maigrot
delivered
this
message
in
a
solemn
tone
and
the
norman
chronicle
says
that
at
the
word
excommunication
the
english
chiefs
looked
at
one
another
as
if
some
great
danger
were
impending
one
of
them
then
spoke
as
follows
must
fight
whatever
may
be
the
danger
to
us
for
what
we
have
to
consider
is
not
whether
we
shall
accept
and
receive
a
new
lord
as
if
our
king
were
dead
the
case
is
quite
otherwise
the
norman
has
given
our
lands
to
his
captains
to
his
knights
to
all
his
people
the
greater
part
of
whom
have
already
done
homage
to
him
for
them
they
will
all
look
for
their
gift
if
their
duke
become
our
king
and
he
himself
is
bound
to
deliver
up
to
them
our
goods
our
wives
and
our
daughters
all
is
promised
to
them
beforehand
they
come
not
only
to
ruin
us
but
to
ruin
our
descendants
also
and
to
take
from
us
the
country
of
our
ancestors
and
what
shall
we
do
whither
shall
we
go
when
we
have
no
longer
a
country
the
english
promised
by
a
unanimous
oath
to
make
neither
peace
nor
truce
nor
treaty
with
the
invader
but
to
die
or
drive
away
the
normans
thierry
the
of
october
was
occupied
in
these
negotiations
and
at
night
the
duke
announced
to
his
men
that
the
next
day
would
be
the
day
of
battle
that
night
is
said
to
have
been
passed
by
the
two
armies
in
very
different
manners
the
saxon
soldiers
spent
it
in
joviality
singing
their
national
songs
and
draining
huge
horns
of
ale
and
wine
round
their
the
normans
when
they
had
looked
to
their
arms
and
horses
confessed
themselves
to
the
priests
with
whom
their
camp
was
thronged
and
received
the
sacrament
by
thousands
at
a
time
on
saturday
the
of
october
was
fought
the
great
battle
it
is
not
difficult
to
compose
a
narrative
of
its
principal
incidents
from
the
historical
information
which
we
possess
especially
if
aided
by
an
examination
of
the
ground
but
it
is
far
better
to
adopt
the
words
of
the
old
chroniclers
who
wrote
while
the
recollections
of
the
battle
were
yet
fresh
and
while
the
feelings
and
prejudices
of
the
combatants
yet
glowed
in
the
bosoms
of
their
near
descendants
robert
wace
the
norman
poet
who
presented
his
roman
de
rou
to
our
henry
is
the
most
picturesque
and
animated
of
the
old
writers
and
from
him
we
can
obtain
a
more
vivid
and
full
description
of
the
conflict
than
even
the
most
brilliant
of
the
present
time
can
supply
we
have
also
an
antique
memorial
of
the
battle
more
to
be
relied
on
than
either
chronicler
or
poet
and
which
confirms
wace
narrative
remarkably
in
the
celebrated
bayeux
tapestry
which
represents
the
principal
scenes
of
duke
william
expedition
and
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
it
in
minute
though
occasionally
grotesque
details
and
which
was
undoubtedly
the
production
of
the
same
age
in
which
the
battle
took
place
whether
we
admit
or
reject
the
legend
that
queen
matilda
and
the
ladies
of
her
court
wrought
it
with
their
own
hands
in
honour
of
the
royal
conqueror
let
us
therefore
suffer
the
old
norman
chronicler
to
transport
our
imaginations
to
the
fair
sussex
scenery
of
hastings
with
its
breezy
uplands
its
grassy
slopes
and
ridges
of
open
down
swelling
inland
from
the
sparkling
sea
its
scattered
copses
and
its
denser
glades
of
intervening
forests
clad
in
all
the
varied
tints
of
autumn
as
they
appeared
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
october
seven
hundred
and
years
ago
the
norman
host
is
pouring
forth
from
its
tents
and
each
troop
and
each
company
is
forming
fast
under
the
banner
of
its
leader
the
masses
have
been
sung
which
were
finished
betimes
in
the
morning
the
barons
have
all
assembled
round
duke
william
and
the
duke
has
ordered
that
the
army
shall
be
formed
in
three
divisions
so
as
to
make
the
attack
upon
the
saxon
position
in
three
places
the
duke
stood
on
a
hill
where
he
could
best
see
his
men
the
barons
surrounded
him
and
he
spake
to
them
proudly
he
told
them
how
he
trusted
them
and
how
all
that
he
gained
should
be
theirs
and
how
sure
he
felt
of
conquest
for
in
all
the
world
there
was
not
so
brave
an
army
or
such
good
men
and
true
as
were
then
forming
around
him
then
they
cheered
him
in
turn
and
cried
out
will
not
see
one
coward
none
here
will
fear
to
die
for
love
of
you
if
need
be
and
he
answered
them
thank
you
well
for
god
sake
spare
not
strike
hard
at
the
beginning
stay
not
to
take
spoil
all
the
booty
shall
be
in
common
and
there
will
be
plenty
for
everyone
there
will
be
no
safety
in
asking
quarter
or
in
fight
the
english
will
never
love
or
spare
a
norman
felons
they
were
and
felons
they
are
false
they
were
and
false
they
will
be
show
no
weakness
towards
them
for
they
will
have
no
pity
on
you
neither
the
coward
for
running
well
nor
the
bold
man
for
smiting
well
will
be
the
better
liked
by
the
english
nor
will
any
be
the
more
spared
on
either
account
you
may
fly
to
the
sea
but
you
can
fly
no
further
you
will
find
neither
ships
nor
bridge
there
there
will
be
no
sailors
to
receive
you
and
the
english
will
overtake
you
there
and
slay
you
in
your
shame
more
of
you
will
die
in
flight
than
in
the
battle
then
as
flight
will
not
secure
you
fight
and
you
will
conquer
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
victory
we
are
come
for
glory
the
victory
is
in
our
hands
and
we
may
make
sure
of
obtaining
it
if
we
so
please
as
the
duke
was
speaking
thus
and
would
yet
have
spoken
more
william
fitz
osber
rode
up
with
his
horse
all
coated
with
iron
said
he
tarry
here
too
long
let
us
all
arm
ourselves
allons
allons
then
all
went
to
their
tents
and
armed
themselves
as
they
best
might
and
the
duke
was
very
busy
giving
every
one
his
orders
and
he
was
courteous
to
all
the
vassals
giving
away
many
arms
and
horses
to
them
when
he
prepared
to
arm
himself
he
called
first
for
his
good
hauberk
and
a
man
brought
it
on
his
arm
and
placed
it
before
him
but
in
putting
his
head
in
to
get
it
on
he
unawares
turned
it
the
wrong
way
with
the
back
part
in
front
he
soon
changed
it
but
when
he
saw
that
those
who
stood
by
were
sorely
alarmed
he
said
have
seen
many
a
man
who
if
such
a
thing
had
happened
to
him
would
not
have
borne
arms
or
entered
the
field
the
same
day
but
i
never
believed
in
omens
and
i
never
will
i
trust
in
god
for
he
does
in
all
things
his
pleasure
and
ordains
what
is
to
come
to
pass
according
to
his
will
i
have
never
liked
nor
believed
in
diviners
but
i
commend
myself
to
our
lady
let
not
this
mischance
give
you
trouble
the
hauberk
which
was
turned
wrong
and
then
set
right
by
me
signifies
that
a
change
will
arise
out
of
the
matter
which
we
are
now
stirring
you
shall
see
the
name
of
duke
changed
into
king
yea
a
king
shall
i
be
who
hitherto
have
been
but
duke
then
he
crossed
himself
and
straightway
took
his
hauberk
stooped
his
head
and
put
it
on
aright
and
laced
his
helmet
and
girt
on
his
sword
which
a
varlet
brought
him
then
the
duke
called
for
his
good
horse
a
better
could
not
be
found
it
had
been
sent
him
by
a
king
of
spain
out
of
very
great
friendship
neither
arms
nor
the
press
of
fighting
men
did
it
fear
if
its
lord
spurred
it
on
walter
giffard
brought
it
the
duke
stretched
out
his
hand
took
the
reins
put
foot
in
stirrup
and
mounted
and
the
good
horse
pawed
pranced
reared
himself
up
and
curvetted
the
viscount
of
toarz
saw
how
the
duke
bore
himself
in
arms
and
said
to
his
people
that
were
around
him
have
i
seen
a
man
so
fairly
armed
nor
one
who
rods
so
gallantly
or
bore
his
arms
or
became
his
hauberk
so
well
neither
any
one
who
bore
his
lance
so
gracefully
or
sat
his
horse
and
managed
him
so
nobly
there
is
no
such
knight
under
heaven
a
fair
count
he
is
and
fair
king
he
will
be
let
him
fight
and
he
shall
overcome
shame
be
to
the
man
who
shall
fail
him
then
the
duke
called
for
the
standard
which
the
pope
had
sent
him
and
he
who
bore
it
having
unfolded
it
the
duke
took
it
and
called
to
raol
de
conches
my
standard
said
he
i
would
not
but
do
you
right
by
right
and
by
ancestry
your
line
are
of
normandy
and
very
good
knights
have
they
all
been
but
raol
said
that
he
would
serve
the
duke
that
day
in
other
guise
and
would
fight
the
english
with
his
hand
as
long
as
life
should
last
then
the
duke
bade
galtier
giffart
bear
the
standard
but
he
was
old
and
and
bade
the
duke
give
the
standard
to
some
younger
and
stronger
man
to
carry
then
the
duke
said
fiercely
the
splendour
of
god
my
lords
i
think
you
mean
to
betray
and
fail
me
in
this
great
need
said
giffart
so
we
have
done
no
treason
nor
do
i
refuse
from
any
felony
towards
you
but
i
have
to
lead
a
great
chivalry
both
hired
men
and
the
men
of
my
fief
never
had
i
such
good
means
of
serving
you
as
i
now
have
and
if
god
please
i
will
serve
you
if
need
be
i
will
die
for
you
and
will
give
my
own
heart
for
yours
my
faith
quoth
the
duke
always
loved
thee
and
now
i
love
thee
more
if
i
survive
this
day
thou
shalt
be
the
better
for
it
all
thy
days
then
he
called
out
a
knight
whom
he
had
heard
much
praised
tosteins
le
blanc
by
name
whose
abode
was
at
to
him
he
delivered
the
standard
and
tosteins
took
it
right
cheerfully
and
bowed
low
to
him
in
thanks
and
bore
it
gallantly
and
with
good
heart
his
kindred
still
have
quittance
of
all
service
for
their
inheritance
on
that
account
and
their
heirs
are
entitled
so
to
hold
their
inheritance
for
ever
william
sat
on
his
and
called
on
rogier
whom
they
call
de
mongomeri
rely
much
upon
you
said
he
your
men
thitherward
and
attack
them
from
that
side
william
the
son
of
osber
the
seneschal
a
right
good
vassal
shall
go
with
you
and
help
in
the
attack
and
you
shall
have
the
men
of
boulogne
and
poix
and
all
my
soldiers
alain
fergert
and
ameri
shall
attack
on
the
other
side
they
shall
lead
the
poitevins
and
the
bretons
and
all
the
barons
of
maine
and
i
with
my
own
great
men
my
friends
and
kindred
will
fight
in
the
middle
throng
where
the
battle
shall
be
the
hottest
the
barons
and
knights
and
were
all
now
armed
the
were
well
equipped
each
bearing
bow
and
sword
on
their
heads
were
caps
and
to
their
feet
were
bound
buskins
some
had
good
hides
which
they
had
bound
round
their
bodies
and
many
were
clad
in
frocks
and
had
quivers
and
bows
hung
to
their
girdles
the
knights
had
hauberks
and
swords
boots
of
steel
and
shining
helmets
shields
at
their
necks
and
in
their
hands
lances
and
all
had
their
cognizances
so
that
each
might
know
his
fellow
and
norman
might
not
strike
norman
nor
frenchman
kill
his
countryman
by
mistake
those
on
foot
led
the
way
with
serried
ranks
bearing
their
bows
the
knights
rode
next
supporting
the
archers
from
behind
thus
both
horse
and
foot
kept
their
course
and
order
of
march
as
they
began
in
close
ranks
at
a
gentle
pace
that
the
one
might
not
pass
or
separate
from
the
other
all
went
firmly
and
compactly
bearing
themselves
gallantly
harold
had
summoned
his
men
earls
barons
and
vavassours
from
the
castles
and
the
cities
from
the
ports
the
villages
and
boroughs
the
peasants
were
also
called
together
from
the
villages
bearing
such
arms
as
they
found
clubs
and
great
picks
iron
forge
and
stages
the
english
had
enclosed
the
place
where
harold
was
with
his
friends
and
the
barons
of
the
country
whom
he
had
summoned
and
called
together
those
of
london
had
come
at
once
and
those
of
kent
hartfort
and
of
essesse
those
of
suree
and
susesse
of
edmund
and
sufoc
of
norwis
and
norfoc
of
cantorbierre
and
stanfort
bedefort
and
hundetone
the
men
of
northanton
also
came
and
those
of
eurowic
and
bokingkeham
of
bed
and
notinkeham
lindesie
and
nichole
there
came
also
from
the
west
all
who
heard
the
summons
and
very
many
were
to
be
seen
coming
from
salebiere
and
dorset
from
bat
and
from
somerset
many
came
too
from
about
glocestre
and
many
from
wirecestre
from
wincestre
hontesire
and
brichesire
and
many
more
from
other
counties
that
we
have
not
named
and
can
not
indeed
recount
all
who
could
bear
arms
and
had
learnt
the
news
of
the
duke
arrival
came
to
defend
the
land
but
none
came
from
beyond
humbre
for
they
had
other
business
upon
their
hands
the
danes
and
tosti
having
much
damaged
and
weakened
them
harold
knew
that
the
normans
would
come
and
attack
him
hand
to
hand
so
he
had
early
enclosed
the
field
in
which
he
placed
his
men
he
made
them
arm
early
and
range
themselves
for
the
battle
he
himself
having
put
on
arms
and
equipments
that
became
such
a
lord
the
duke
he
said
ought
to
seek
him
as
he
wanted
to
conquer
england
and
it
became
him
to
abide
the
attack
who
had
to
defend
the
land
he
commanded
the
people
and
counselled
his
barons
to
keep
themselves
altogether
and
defend
themselves
in
a
body
for
if
they
once
separated
they
would
with
difficulty
recover
themselves
normans
he
said
good
vassals
valiant
on
foot
and
on
horseback
good
knights
are
they
on
horseback
and
well
used
to
battle
all
is
lost
if
they
once
penetrate
our
ranks
they
have
brought
long
lances
and
swords
but
you
have
pointed
lances
and
bills
and
i
do
not
expect
that
their
arms
can
stand
against
yours
cleave
wherever
you
can
it
will
be
ill
done
if
you
spare
aught
the
english
had
built
up
a
fence
before
them
with
their
shields
and
with
ash
and
other
wood
and
had
well
joined
and
wattled
in
the
whole
work
so
as
not
to
leave
even
a
crevice
and
thus
they
had
a
barricade
in
their
front
through
which
any
norman
who
would
attack
them
must
first
pass
being
covered
in
this
way
by
their
shields
and
barricades
their
aim
was
to
defend
themselves
and
if
they
had
remained
steady
for
that
purpose
they
would
not
have
been
conquered
that
day
for
every
norman
who
made
his
way
in
lost
his
life
either
by
hatchet
or
bill
by
club
or
other
weapons
they
wore
short
and
close
hauberks
and
helmets
that
hung
over
their
garments
king
harold
issued
orders
and
made
proclamation
round
that
all
should
be
ranged
with
their
faces
towards
the
enemy
and
that
no
one
should
move
from
where
he
was
so
that
whoever
came
might
find
them
ready
and
that
whatever
any
one
be
he
norman
or
other
should
do
each
should
do
his
best
to
defend
his
own
place
then
he
ordered
the
men
of
kent
to
go
where
the
normans
were
likely
to
make
the
attack
for
they
say
that
the
men
of
kent
are
entitled
to
strike
first
and
that
whenever
the
king
goes
to
battle
the
first
blow
belongs
to
them
the
right
of
the
men
of
london
is
to
guard
the
king
body
to
place
themselves
around
him
and
to
guard
his
standard
and
they
were
accordingly
placed
by
the
standard
to
watch
and
defend
it
when
harold
had
made
his
reply
and
given
his
orders
he
came
into
the
midst
of
the
english
and
dismounted
by
the
side
of
the
standard
leofwin
and
gurth
his
brothers
were
with
him
and
around
him
he
had
barons
enough
as
he
stood
by
his
standard
which
was
in
truth
a
noble
one
sparkling
with
gold
and
precious
stones
after
the
victory
william
sent
it
to
the
pope
to
prove
and
commemorate
his
great
conquest
and
glory
the
english
stood
in
close
ranks
ready
and
eager
for
the
fight
and
they
moreover
made
a
fosse
which
went
across
the
field
guarding
one
side
of
their
army
meanwhile
the
normans
appeared
advancing
over
the
ridge
of
a
rising
ground
and
the
first
division
of
their
troops
moved
onwards
along
the
hill
and
across
a
vallley
and
presently
another
division
still
larger
came
in
sight
close
following
upon
the
first
and
they
were
led
towards
another
part
of
the
field
forming
together
as
the
first
body
had
done
and
while
harold
saw
and
examined
them
and
was
pointing
them
out
to
gurth
a
fresh
company
came
in
sight
covering
all
the
plain
and
in
the
midst
of
them
was
raised
the
standard
that
came
from
rome
near
it
was
the
duke
and
the
best
men
and
greatest
strength
of
the
army
were
there
the
good
knights
the
good
vassals
and
brave
warriors
were
there
and
there
were
gathered
together
the
gentle
barons
the
good
archers
and
the
whose
duty
it
was
to
guard
the
duke
and
range
themselves
around
him
the
youths
and
common
herd
of
the
camp
whose
business
was
not
to
join
in
the
battle
but
to
take
care
of
the
harness
and
stores
moved
on
towards
a
rising
ground
the
priests
and
the
clerks
also
ascended
a
hill
there
to
offer
up
prayers
to
god
and
watch
the
event
of
the
battle
the
english
stood
firm
on
foot
in
close
ranks
and
carried
themselves
right
boldly
each
man
had
his
hauberk
on
with
his
sword
girt
and
his
shield
at
his
neck
great
hatchets
were
also
slung
at
their
necks
with
which
they
expected
to
strike
heavy
blows
the
normans
brought
on
the
three
divisions
of
their
army
to
attack
at
different
places
they
set
out
in
three
companies
and
in
three
companies
did
they
fight
the
first
and
second
had
come
up
and
then
advanced
the
third
which
was
the
greatest
with
that
came
the
duke
with
his
own
men
and
all
moved
boldly
forward
as
soon
as
the
two
armies
were
in
full
view
of
each
other
great
noise
and
tumult
arose
you
might
hear
the
sound
of
many
trumpets
of
bugles
and
of
horns
and
then
you
might
see
men
ranging
themselves
in
line
lifting
their
shields
raising
their
lances
bending
their
bows
handling
their
arrows
ready
for
assault
and
defence
the
english
stood
ready
to
their
post
the
normans
still
moved
on
and
when
they
drew
near
the
english
were
to
be
seen
stirring
to
and
fro
were
going
and
coming
troops
ranging
themselves
in
order
some
with
their
colour
rising
others
turning
pale
some
making
ready
their
arms
others
raising
their
shields
the
brave
man
rousing
himself
to
fight
the
coward
trembling
at
the
approach
of
danger
then
taillefer
who
sang
right
well
rode
mounted
on
a
swift
horse
before
the
duke
singing
of
charlemagne
and
of
roland
of
olivier
and
the
peers
who
died
in
roncesvalles
and
when
they
drew
nigh
to
the
english
boon
sire
cried
taillefer
have
long
served
you
and
you
owe
me
for
all
such
service
so
please
you
you
shall
repay
it
i
ask
as
my
guerdon
and
beseech
you
for
it
earnestly
that
you
will
allow
me
to
strike
the
first
blow
in
the
battle
and
the
duke
answered
grant
it
then
taillefer
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
charging
before
all
the
rest
and
struck
an
englishman
dead
driving
his
lance
below
the
breast
into
his
body
and
stretching
him
upon
the
ground
then
he
drew
his
sword
and
struck
another
crying
out
on
come
on
what
do
ye
sirs
lay
on
lay
on
at
the
second
blow
he
struck
the
english
pushed
forward
and
surrounded
and
slew
him
forthwith
arose
the
noise
and
cry
of
war
and
on
either
side
the
people
put
themselves
in
motion
the
normans
moved
on
to
the
assault
and
the
english
defended
themselves
well
some
were
striking
others
urging
onwards
all
were
bold
and
cast
aside
fear
and
now
behold
that
battle
was
gathered
whereof
the
fame
is
yet
mighty
loud
and
far
resounded
the
bray
of
the
horns
and
the
shocks
of
the
lances
the
mighty
strokes
of
maces
and
the
quick
clashing
of
swords
one
while
the
englishmen
rushed
on
another
while
they
fell
back
one
while
the
men
from
over
the
sea
charged
onwards
and
again
at
other
times
retreated
the
normans
shouted
aie
the
english
people
then
came
the
cunning
manoeuvres
the
rude
shocks
and
strokes
of
the
lance
and
blows
of
the
swords
among
the
sergeants
and
soldiers
both
english
and
norman
when
the
english
fall
the
normans
shout
each
side
taunts
and
defies
the
other
yet
neither
knoweth
what
the
other
saith
and
the
normans
say
the
english
bark
because
they
understand
not
their
speech
some
wax
strong
others
weak
the
brave
exult
but
the
cowards
tremble
as
men
who
are
sore
dismayed
the
normans
press
on
the
assault
and
the
english
defend
their
post
well
they
pierce
the
hauberks
and
cleave
the
shields
receive
and
return
mighty
blows
again
some
press
forwards
others
yield
and
thus
in
various
ways
the
struggle
proceeds
in
the
plain
was
a
fosse
which
the
normans
had
now
behind
them
having
passed
it
in
the
fight
without
regarding
it
but
the
english
charged
and
drove
the
normans
before
them
till
they
made
them
fall
back
upon
this
fosse
overthrowing
into
it
horses
and
men
many
were
to
be
seen
falling
therein
rolling
one
over
the
other
with
their
faces
to
the
earth
and
unable
to
rise
many
of
the
english
also
whom
the
normans
drew
down
along
with
them
died
there
at
no
time
during
the
day
battle
did
so
many
normans
die
as
perished
in
that
fosse
so
those
said
who
saw
the
dead
the
varlets
who
were
set
to
guard
the
harness
began
to
abandon
it
as
they
saw
the
loss
of
the
frenchmen
when
thrown
back
upon
the
fosse
without
power
to
recover
themselves
being
greatly
alarmed
at
seeing
the
difficulty
in
restoring
order
they
began
to
quit
the
harness
and
sought
around
not
knowing
where
to
find
shelter
then
duke
brother
odo
the
good
priest
the
bishop
of
bayeux
galloped
up
and
said
to
them
fast
stand
fast
be
quiet
and
move
not
fear
nothing
for
if
god
please
we
shall
conquer
yet
so
they
took
courage
and
rested
where
they
were
and
odo
returned
galloping
back
to
where
the
battle
was
most
fierce
and
was
of
great
service
on
that
day
he
had
put
hauberk
on
over
a
white
aube
wide
in
the
body
with
the
sleeve
tight
and
sat
on
a
white
horse
so
that
all
might
recognise
him
in
his
hand
he
held
a
mace
and
wherever
he
saw
most
need
he
held
up
and
stationed
the
knights
and
often
urged
them
on
to
assault
and
strike
the
enemy
from
nine
in
the
morning
when
the
combat
began
till
three
came
the
battle
was
up
and
down
this
way
and
that
and
no
one
knew
who
would
conquer
and
win
the
land
both
sides
stood
so
firm
and
fought
so
well
that
no
one
could
guess
which
would
prevail
the
norman
archers
with
their
bows
shot
thickly
upon
the
english
but
they
covered
themselves
with
their
shields
so
that
the
arrows
could
not
reach
their
bodies
nor
do
any
mischief
how
true
soever
was
their
aim
or
however
well
they
shot
then
the
normans
determined
to
shoot
their
arrows
upwards
into
the
air
so
that
they
might
fall
on
their
enemies
heads
and
strike
their
faces
the
archers
adopted
this
scheme
and
shot
up
into
the
air
towards
the
english
and
the
arrows
in
falling
struck
their
heads
and
faces
and
put
out
the
eyes
of
many
and
all
feared
to
open
their
eyes
or
leave
their
faces
unguarded
the
arrows
now
flew
thicker
than
rain
before
the
wind
fast
sped
the
shafts
that
the
english
called
then
it
was
that
an
arrow
that
had
been
thus
shot
upwards
struck
harold
above
his
right
eye
and
put
it
out
in
his
agony
he
drew
the
arrow
and
threw
it
away
breaking
it
with
his
hands
and
the
pain
to
his
head
was
so
great
that
he
leaned
upon
his
shield
so
the
english
were
wont
to
say
and
still
say
to
the
french
that
the
arrow
was
well
shot
which
was
so
sent
up
against
their
king
and
that
the
archer
won
them
great
glory
who
thus
put
out
harold
eye
the
normans
saw
that
the
english
defended
themselves
well
and
were
so
strong
in
their
position
that
they
could
do
little
against
them
so
they
consulted
together
privily
and
arranged
to
draw
off
and
pretend
to
flee
till
the
english
should
pursue
and
scatter
themselves
over
the
field
for
they
saw
that
if
they
could
once
get
their
enemies
to
break
their
ranks
they
might
be
attacked
and
discomfited
much
more
easily
as
they
had
said
so
they
did
the
normans
by
little
and
little
fled
the
english
following
them
as
the
one
fell
back
the
other
pressed
after
and
when
the
frenchmen
retreated
the
english
thought
and
cried
out
that
the
men
of
france
fled
and
would
never
return
thus
they
were
deceived
by
the
pretended
flight
and
great
mischief
thereby
befell
them
for
if
they
had
not
moved
from
their
position
it
is
not
likely
that
they
would
have
been
conquered
at
all
but
like
fools
they
broke
their
lines
and
pursued
the
normans
were
to
be
seen
following
up
their
stratagem
retreating
slowly
so
as
to
draw
the
english
further
on
as
they
still
flee
the
english
pursue
they
push
out
their
lances
and
stretch
forth
their
hatchets
following
the
normans
as
they
go
rejoicing
in
the
success
of
their
scheme
and
scattering
themselves
over
the
plain
and
the
english
meantime
jeered
and
insulted
their
foes
with
words
they
cried
came
hither
in
an
evil
hour
wanting
our
lands
and
seeking
to
seize
our
property
fools
that
ye
were
to
come
normandy
is
too
far
off
and
you
will
not
easily
reach
it
it
is
of
little
use
to
run
back
unless
you
can
cross
the
sea
at
a
leap
or
can
drink
it
dry
your
sons
and
daughters
are
lost
to
you
the
normans
bore
it
all
but
in
fact
they
knew
not
what
the
english
said
their
language
seemed
like
the
baying
of
dogs
which
they
could
not
understand
at
length
they
stopped
and
turned
round
determined
to
recover
their
ranks
and
the
barons
might
be
heard
crying
aie
for
a
halt
then
the
normans
resumed
their
former
position
turning
their
faces
towards
the
enemy
and
their
men
were
to
be
seen
facing
round
and
rushing
onwards
to
a
fresh
melee
the
one
party
assaulting
the
other
this
man
striking
another
pressing
onwards
one
hits
another
misses
one
flies
another
pursues
one
is
aiming
a
stroke
while
another
discharges
his
blow
norman
strives
with
englishman
again
and
aims
his
blows
afresh
one
flies
another
pursues
swiftly
the
combatants
are
many
the
plain
wide
the
battle
and
the
melee
fierce
on
every
hand
they
fight
hard
the
blows
are
heavy
and
the
struggle
becomes
fierce
the
normans
were
playing
their
part
well
when
an
english
knight
came
rushing
up
having
in
his
company
a
hundred
men
furnished
with
various
arms
he
wielded
a
northern
hatchet
with
the
blade
a
full
foot
long
and
was
well
armed
after
his
manner
being
tall
bold
and
of
noble
carriage
in
the
front
of
the
battle
where
the
normans
thronged
most
he
came
bounding
on
swifter
than
the
stag
many
normans
falling
before
him
and
his
company
he
rushed
straight
upon
a
norman
who
was
armed
and
riding
on
a
and
tried
with
his
hatchet
of
steel
to
cleave
his
helmet
but
the
blow
miscarried
and
the
sharp
blade
glanced
down
before
the
driving
through
the
horse
neck
down
to
the
ground
so
that
both
horse
and
master
fell
together
to
the
earth
i
know
not
whether
the
englishman
struck
another
blow
but
the
normans
who
saw
the
stroke
were
astonished
and
about
to
abandon
the
assault
when
roger
de
mongomeri
came
galloping
up
with
his
lance
set
and
heeding
not
the
axe
which
the
wielded
aloft
struck
him
down
and
left
him
stretched
upon
the
ground
then
roger
cried
out
strike
the
day
is
ours
and
again
a
fierce
melee
was
to
be
seen
with
many
a
blow
of
lance
and
sword
the
english
still
defending
themselves
killing
the
horses
and
cleaving
the
shields
there
was
a
french
soldier
of
noble
mien
who
sat
his
horse
gallantly
he
spied
two
englishmen
who
were
also
carrying
themselves
boldly
they
were
both
men
of
great
worth
and
had
become
companions
in
arms
and
fought
together
the
one
protecting
the
other
they
bore
two
long
and
broad
bills
and
did
great
mischief
to
the
normans
killing
both
horses
and
men
the
french
soldier
looked
at
them
and
their
bills
and
was
sore
alarmed
for
he
was
afraid
of
losing
his
good
horse
the
best
that
he
had
and
would
willingly
have
turned
to
some
other
quarter
if
it
would
not
have
looked
like
cowardice
he
soon
however
recovered
his
courage
and
spurring
his
horse
gave
him
the
bridle
and
galloped
swiftly
forward
fearing
the
two
bills
he
raised
his
shield
and
struck
one
of
the
englishmen
with
his
lance
on
the
breast
so
that
the
iron
passed
out
at
his
back
at
the
moment
that
he
fell
the
lance
broke
and
the
frenchmen
seized
the
mace
that
hung
at
his
right
side
and
struck
the
other
englishman
a
blow
that
completely
broke
his
skull
on
the
other
side
was
an
englishman
who
much
annoyed
the
french
continually
assaulting
them
with
a
hatchet
he
had
a
helmet
made
of
wood
which
he
had
fastened
down
to
his
coat
and
laced
round
his
neck
so
that
no
blows
could
reach
his
head
the
ravage
he
was
making
was
seen
by
a
gallant
norman
knight
who
rode
a
horse
that
neither
fire
nor
water
could
stop
in
its
career
when
its
master
urged
it
on
the
knight
spurred
and
his
horse
carried
him
on
well
till
he
charged
the
englishman
striking
him
over
the
helmet
so
that
it
fell
down
over
his
eyes
and
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
raise
it
and
uncover
the
face
the
norman
cut
off
his
right
hand
so
that
his
hatchet
fell
to
the
ground
another
norman
sprang
forward
and
eagerly
seized
the
prize
with
both
his
hands
but
he
kept
it
little
space
and
paid
dearly
for
it
for
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
hatchet
an
englishman
with
his
axe
struck
him
over
the
back
breaking
all
his
bones
so
that
his
entrails
and
lungs
gushed
forth
the
knight
of
the
good
horse
meantime
returned
without
injury
but
on
his
way
he
met
another
englishman
and
bore
him
down
under
his
his
horse
wounding
him
grievously
and
trampling
him
altogether
under
foot
and
now
might
be
heard
the
loud
clang
and
cry
of
battle
and
the
clashing
of
lances
the
english
stood
firm
in
their
barricades
and
shivered
the
lances
beating
them
into
pieces
with
their
bills
and
maces
the
normans
drew
their
swords
and
hewed
down
the
barricades
and
the
english
in
great
trouble
fell
back
upon
their
standard
where
were
collected
the
maimed
and
wounded
there
were
many
knights
of
chauz
who
jousted
and
made
attacks
the
english
knew
not
how
to
joust
or
bear
arms
on
horseback
but
fought
with
hatchets
and
bills
a
man
when
he
wanted
to
strike
with
one
of
their
hatchets
was
obliged
to
hold
it
with
both
his
hands
and
could
not
at
the
same
time
as
it
seems
to
me
both
cover
himself
and
strike
with
any
freedom
the
english
fell
back
towards
the
standard
which
was
upon
a
rising
ground
and
the
normans
followed
them
across
the
valley
attacking
them
on
foot
and
horseback
then
hue
de
mortemer
with
the
sires
and
cler
rode
up
and
charged
overthrowing
many
robert
fitz
erneis
fixed
his
lance
took
his
shield
and
galloping
towards
the
standard
with
his
sword
struck
an
englishman
who
was
in
front
killed
him
and
then
drawing
back
his
sword
attacked
many
others
and
pushed
straight
for
the
standard
trying
to
beat
it
down
but
the
english
surrounded
it
and
killed
him
with
their
bills
he
was
found
on
the
spot
when
they
afterwards
sought
for
him
dead
and
lying
at
the
standard
foot
duke
william
pressed
close
upon
the
english
with
his
lance
striving
hard
to
reach
the
standard
with
the
great
troop
he
led
and
seeking
earnestly
for
harold
on
whose
account
the
whole
war
was
the
normans
follow
their
lord
and
press
around
him
they
ply
their
blows
upon
the
english
and
these
defend
themselves
stoutly
striving
hard
with
their
enemies
returning
blow
for
blow
one
of
them
was
a
man
of
great
strength
a
wrestler
who
did
great
mischief
to
the
normans
with
his
hatchet
all
feared
him
for
he
struck
down
a
great
many
normans
the
duke
spurred
on
his
horse
and
aimed
a
blow
at
him
but
he
stooped
and
so
escaped
the
stroke
then
jumping
on
one
side
he
lifted
his
hatchet
aloft
and
as
the
duke
bent
to
avoid
the
blow
the
englishman
boldly
struck
him
on
the
head
and
beat
in
his
helmet
though
without
doing
much
injury
he
was
very
near
falling
however
but
bearing
on
his
stirrups
he
recovered
himself
immediately
and
when
he
thought
to
have
revenged
himself
upon
the
churl
by
killing
him
he
had
escaped
dreading
the
duke
blow
he
ran
back
in
among
the
english
but
he
was
not
safe
even
there
for
the
normans
seeing
him
pursued
and
caught
him
and
having
pierced
him
through
and
through
with
their
lances
left
him
dead
on
the
ground
where
the
throng
of
the
battle
was
greatest
the
men
of
kent
and
essex
fought
wondrously
well
and
made
the
normans
again
retreat
but
without
doing
them
much
injury
and
when
the
duke
saw
his
men
fall
back
and
the
english
triumphing
over
them
his
spirit
rose
high
and
he
seized
his
shield
and
his
lance
which
a
vassal
handed
to
him
and
took
his
post
by
his
standard
then
those
who
kept
close
guard
by
him
and
rode
where
he
rode
being
about
a
thousand
armed
men
came
and
rushed
with
closed
ranks
upon
the
english
and
with
the
weight
of
their
good
horses
and
the
blows
the
knights
gave
broke
the
press
of
the
enemy
and
scattered
the
crowd
before
them
the
good
duke
leading
them
on
in
front
many
pursued
and
many
fled
many
were
the
englishmen
who
fell
around
and
were
trampled
under
the
horses
crawling
upon
the
earth
and
not
able
to
rise
many
of
the
richest
and
noblest
men
fell
in
that
rout
but
the
english
still
rallied
in
places
smote
down
those
whom
they
reached
and
maintained
the
combat
the
best
they
could
beating
down
the
men
and
killing
the
horses
one
englishman
watched
the
duke
and
plotted
to
kill
him
he
would
have
struck
him
with
his
lance
but
he
could
not
for
the
duke
struck
him
first
and
felled
him
to
the
earth
loud
was
now
the
clamour
and
great
the
slaughter
many
a
soul
then
quitted
the
body
it
inhabited
the
living
marched
over
the
heaps
of
dead
and
each
side
was
weary
of
striking
he
charged
on
who
could
and
he
who
could
no
longer
strike
still
pushed
forward
the
strong
struggled
with
the
strong
some
failed
others
triumphed
the
cowards
fell
back
the
brave
pressed
on
and
sad
was
his
fate
who
fell
in
the
midst
for
he
had
little
chance
of
rising
again
and
many
in
truth
fell
who
never
rose
at
all
being
crushed
under
the
throng
and
now
the
normans
pressed
on
so
far
that
at
last
they
had
reached
the
standard
there
harold
had
remained
defending
himself
to
the
utmost
but
he
was
sorely
wounded
in
his
eye
by
the
arrow
and
suffered
grievous
pain
from
the
blow
an
armed
man
came
in
the
throng
of
the
battle
and
struck
him
on
the
ventaille
of
his
helmet
and
beat
him
to
the
ground
and
as
he
sought
to
recover
himself
a
knight
beat
him
down
again
striking
him
on
the
thick
of
his
thigh
down
to
the
bone
gurth
saw
the
english
falling
around
and
that
there
was
no
remedy
he
saw
his
race
hastening
to
ruin
and
despaired
of
any
aid
he
would
have
fled
but
could
not
for
the
throng
continually
increased
and
the
duke
pushed
on
till
he
reached
him
and
struck
him
with
great
force
whether
he
died
of
that
blow
i
know
not
but
it
was
said
that
he
fell
under
it
and
rose
no
more
the
standard
was
beaten
down
the
golden
standard
was
taken
and
harold
and
the
best
of
his
friends
were
slain
but
there
was
so
much
eagerness
and
throng
of
so
many
around
seeking
to
kill
him
that
i
know
not
who
it
was
that
slew
him
the
english
were
in
great
trouble
at
having
lost
their
king
and
at
the
duke
having
conquered
and
beat
down
the
standard
but
they
still
fought
on
and
defended
themselves
long
and
in
fact
till
the
day
drew
to
a
close
then
it
clearly
appeared
to
all
that
the
standard
was
lost
and
the
news
had
spread
throughout
the
army
that
harold
for
certain
was
dead
and
all
saw
that
there
was
no
longer
any
hope
so
they
left
the
field
and
those
fled
who
could
william
fought
well
many
an
assault
did
he
lead
many
a
blow
did
he
give
and
many
receive
and
many
fell
dead
under
his
hand
two
horses
were
killed
under
him
and
he
took
a
third
at
time
of
need
so
that
he
fell
not
to
the
ground
and
he
lost
not
a
drop
of
blood
but
whatever
any
one
did
and
whoever
lived
or
died
this
is
certain
that
william
conquered
and
that
many
of
the
english
fled
from
the
field
and
many
died
on
the
spot
then
he
returned
thanks
to
god
and
in
his
pride
ordered
his
standard
to
be
brought
and
set
up
on
high
where
the
english
standard
had
stood
and
that
was
the
signal
of
his
having
conquered
and
beaten
down
the
foe
and
he
ordered
his
tent
to
be
raised
on
the
spot
among
the
dead
and
had
his
meat
brought
thither
and
his
supper
prepared
there
then
he
took
off
his
armour
and
the
barons
and
knights
pages
and
squires
came
when
he
had
unstrung
his
shield
and
they
took
the
helmet
from
his
head
and
the
hauberk
from
his
back
and
saw
the
heavy
blows
upon
his
shield
and
how
his
helmet
was
dinted
in
and
all
greatly
wondered
and
said
a
baron
never
bestrode
or
dealt
such
blows
or
did
such
feats
of
arms
neither
has
there
been
on
earth
such
a
knight
since
rollant
and
olivier
thus
they
lauded
and
extolled
him
greatly
and
rejoiced
in
what
they
saw
but
grieving
also
for
their
friends
who
were
slain
in
the
battle
and
the
duke
stood
meanwhile
among
them
of
noble
stature
and
mien
and
rendered
thanks
to
the
king
of
glory
through
whom
he
had
the
victory
and
thanked
the
knights
around
him
mourning
also
frequently
for
the
dead
and
he
ate
and
drank
among
the
dead
and
made
his
bed
that
night
upon
the
field
the
morrow
was
sunday
and
those
who
had
slept
upon
the
field
of
battle
keeping
watch
around
and
suffering
great
fatigue
bestirred
themselves
at
break
of
day
and
sought
out
and
buried
such
of
the
bodies
of
their
dead
friends
as
they
might
find
the
noble
ladies
of
the
land
also
came
some
to
seek
their
husbands
and
others
their
fathers
sons
or
brothers
they
bore
the
bodies
to
their
villages
and
interred
them
at
the
churches
and
the
clerks
and
priests
of
the
country
were
ready
and
at
the
request
of
their
friends
took
the
bodies
that
were
found
and
prepared
graves
and
laid
them
therein
king
harold
was
carried
and
buried
at
varham
but
i
know
not
who
it
was
that
bore
him
thither
neither
do
i
know
who
buried
him
many
remained
on
the
field
and
many
had
fled
in
the
night
such
is
a
norman
account
of
the
battle
of
hastings
which
does
full
justice
to
the
valour
of
the
saxons
as
well
as
to
the
skill
and
bravery
of
the
victors
in
the
preceding
pages
i
have
woven
together
the
purpureos
pannos
of
the
old
chronicler
in
so
doing
i
have
largely
availed
myself
of
edgar
taylor
version
of
that
part
of
the
roman
de
rou
which
describes
the
conquest
by
giving
engravings
from
the
bayeux
tapestry
and
excellent
notes
taylor
has
added
much
to
the
value
and
interest
of
his
volume
it
is
indeed
evident
that
the
loss
of
the
battle
to
the
english
was
owing
to
the
wound
which
harold
received
in
the
afternoon
and
which
must
have
incapacitated
him
from
effective
command
when
we
remember
that
he
had
himself
just
won
the
battle
of
stamford
bridge
over
harald
hardrada
by
the
manoeuvre
of
a
feigned
flight
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
he
could
be
deceived
by
the
same
stratagem
on
the
part
of
the
normans
at
hastings
but
his
men
when
deprived
of
his
control
would
very
naturally
be
led
by
their
inconsiderate
ardour
into
the
pursuit
that
proved
so
fatal
to
them
all
the
narratives
of
the
battle
however
much
they
may
vary
as
to
the
precise
time
and
manner
of
harold
fall
eulogise
the
generalship
and
the
personal
prowess
which
he
displayed
until
the
fatal
arrow
struck
him
the
skill
with
which
he
had
posted
his
army
was
proved
both
by
the
slaughter
which
it
cost
the
normans
to
force
the
position
and
also
by
the
desperate
rally
which
some
of
the
saxons
made
after
the
battle
in
the
forest
in
the
rear
in
which
they
cut
off
a
large
number
of
the
pursuing
normans
this
circumstance
is
particularly
mentioned
by
william
of
poictiers
the
conqueror
own
chaplain
indeed
if
harold
or
either
of
his
brothers
had
survived
the
remains
of
the
english
army
might
have
formed
again
in
the
wood
and
could
at
least
have
effected
an
orderly
retreat
and
prolonged
the
war
but
both
gurth
and
leofwine
and
all
the
bravest
thanes
of
southern
england
lay
dead
on
senlac
around
their
fallen
king
and
the
fallen
standard
of
their
country
the
exact
number
of
the
slain
on
the
saxon
side
is
unknown
but
we
read
that
on
the
side
of
the
victors
out
of
sixty
thousand
men
who
had
been
engaged
no
less
than
a
fourth
perished
so
well
had
the
english
plied
the
ghastly
blow

two
of

of

abbey
which
harold
had
founded
a
little
time
before
his
election
to
the
throne
had
accompanied
him
to
the
battle
on
the
morning
after
the
slaughter
they
begged
and
gained
permission
of
the
conqueror
to
search
for
the
body
of
their
benefactor
the
norman
soldiery
and
had
stripped
and
gashed
the
slain
and
the
two
monks
vainly
strove
to
recognise
from
among
the
mutilated
and
gory
heaps
around
them

features
of

former

the
king
mother
now
sought
the
victorious
norman
and
begged
the
dead
body
of
her
son
but
william
at
first
answered
in
his
wrath
and
in
the
hardness
of
his
heart
that
a
man
who
had
been
false
to
his
word
and
his
religion
should
have
no
other
sepulchre
than
the
sand
of
the
shore
he
added
with
a
sneer
harold
mounted
guard
on
the
coast
while
he
was
alive
he
may
continue
his
guard
now
he
is
dead
the
taunt
was
an
unintentional
eulogy
and
a
grave
washed
by
the
spray
of
the
sussex
waves
would
have
been
the
noblest
for
the
martyr
of
saxon
freedom
but
harold
mother
was
urgent
in
her
lamentations
and
her
prayers
the
conqueror
relented
like
achilles
he
gave
up
the
dead
body
of
his
fallen
foe
to
a
parent
supplications
and
the
remains

a

upwards
of

the

were
to

deny

the
formidable
part
that

her

has
been
such
as
to
make
the
crisis
of
her
earlier
fortunes
a
point
of
interest
and
it
may
be
asserted
without
exaggeration
that
the
future
career
of
every
nation
was
involved
in
the
result
of
the
struggle
by
which
the
unconscious
heroine
of
france
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
rescued
her
country
from
becoming
a
second

under
the
yoke
of

the

was
the
case

their
lines
round
orleans
four
hundred
and
years
ago
a
series
of
dreadful
defeats

thinned

of

and
daunted

spirits
of
her
soldiers
a
foreign
king
had
been
proclaimed
in
her
capital
and
foreign
armies
of
the
bravest
veterans
and
led
by
the
ablest
captains
then
known
in
the
world
occupied
the
fairest
portions
of

territory
worse
to
her
even

the

most
powerful

had
leagued

sworn
fealty

the
general
prevalence

customary

wretched

of

were

masters
of

north
of

prepared
their
forces
for
the
conquest
of
the
southern
provinces
which
yet
adhered
to
the
cause
of
the
dauphin
the
city
of
orleans
on
the
banks
of
that
river
was
looked
upon
as
the
last
stronghold
of
the
french
national
party
if
the
english
could
once
obtain
possession
of
it
their
victorious
progress
through
the
residue
of
the
kingdom
seemed
free
from
any
serious
obstacle
accordingly
the
earl
of
salisbury
one
of
the
bravest
and
most
experienced
of
the
english
generals
who
had
been
trained
under
henry
marched
to
the
attack
of
the
city
and
after
reducing
several
places
of
inferior
consequence
in
the
neighbourhood
appeared
with
his
army
before
its
walls
on
the
of
october
the
city
of
orleans
itself
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
loire
but
its
suburbs
extended
far
on
the
southern
side
and
a
strong
bridge
connected
them
with
the
town
a
fortification
which
in
modern
military
phrase
would
be
termed
a
defended
the
on
the
southern
side
and
two
towers
called
the
tourelles
were
built
on
the
bridge
itself
where
it
rested
on
an
island
at
a
little
distance
from
the
indeed
the
solid
masonry
of
the
bridge
terminated
at
the
tourelles
and
the
communication
thence
with
the
on
the
southern
shore
was
by
means
of
a
drawbridge
the
tourelles
and
the
formed
together
a
strong
fortified
post
capable
of
containing
a
garrison
of
considerable
strength
and
so
long
as
this
was
in
possession
of
the
orleannais
they
could
communicate
freely
with
the
southern
provinces
the
inhabitants
of
which
like
the
orleannais
themselves
supported
the
cause
of
their
dauphin
against
the
foreigners
lord
salisbury
rightly
judged
the
capture
of
the
tourelles
to
be
the
most
material
step
towards
the
reduction
of
the
city
itself
accordingly
he
directed
his
principal
operations
against
this
post
and
after
some
severe
repulses
he
carried
the
tourelles
by
storm
on
the
of
october
the
french
however
broke
down
the
part
of
the
bridge
which
was
nearest
to
the
north
bank
and
thus
rendered
a
direct
assault
from
the
tourelles
upon
the
city
impossible
but
the
possession
of
this
post
enabled
the
english
to
distress
the
town
greatly
by
a
battery
of
cannon
which
they
planted
there
and
which
commanded
some
of
the
principal
streets
it
has
been
observed
by
hume
that
this
is
the
first
siege
in
which
any
important
use
appears
to
have
been
made
of
artillery
and
even
at
orleans
both
besiegers
and
besieged
seem
to
have
employed
their
cannons
more
as
instruments
of
destruction
against
their
enemy
men
than
as
engines
of
demolition
against
their
enemy
walls
and
works
the
efficacy
of
cannon
in
breaching
solid
masonry
was
taught
europe
by
the
turks
a
few
years
after
wards
at
the
memorable
siege
of
constantinople
in
our
french
wars
as
in
the
wars
of
the
classic
nations
famine
was
looked
on
as
the
surest
weapon
to
compel
the
submission
of
a
town
and
the
great
object
of
the
besiegers
was
to
effect
a
complete
circumvallation
the
great
ambit
of
the
walls
of
orleans
and
the
facilities
which
the
river
gave
for
obtaining
succour
and
supplies
rendered
the
capture
of
the
place
by
this
process
a
matter
of
great
difficulty

succeeded
him
in

english

death

on
the
necessary
works
with
great
skill
and
resolution
six
strongly
fortified
posts
called
bastillos
were
formed
at
certain
intervals
round
the
town
and
the
purpose
of
the
english
engineers
was
to
draw
strong
lines
between
them
during
the
winter
little
progress
was
made
with
the
entrenchments
but
when
the
spring
of
came
the
english
resumed
their
works
with
activity
the
communications
between
the
city
and
the
country
became
more
difficult
and
the
approach
of
want
began
already
to
be
felt
in
orleans
the
besieging
force
also
fared
hardly
for
stores
and
provisions
until
relieved
by
the
effects
of
a
brilliant
victory
which
sir
john
fastolfe
one
of
the
best
english
generals
gained
at
rouvrai
near
orleans
a
few
days
after
ash
wednesday
with
only
sixteen
hundred
fighting
men
sir
john
completely
defeated
an
army
of
french
and
scots
four
thousand
strong
which
had
been
collected
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
the
orleannais
and
harassing
the
besiegers
after
this
encounter
which
seemed
decisively
to
confirm
the
superiority
of
the
english
in
battle
over
their
adversaries
fastolfe
escorted
large
supplies
of
stores
and
food
to
suffolk
camp
and
the
spirits
of
the
english
rose
to
the
highest
pitch
at
the
prospect
of
the
speedy
capture
of
the
city
before
them
and
the
consequent
subjection
of
all
france
beneath
their
arms
the
orleannais
now
in
their
distress
offered
to
surrender
the
city
into
the
hands
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
who
though
the
ally
of
the
english
was
yet
one
of
their
native
princes
the
regent
bedford
refused
these
terms
and
the
speedy
submission
of
the
city
to
the
english
seemed
inevitable
the
dauphin
charles
who
was
now
at
chinon
with
his
remnant
of
a
court
despaired
of
maintaining
any
longer
the
struggle
for
his
crown
and
was
only
prevented
from
abandoning
the
country
by
the
more
masculine
spirits
of
his
mistress
and
his
queen
yet
neither
they
nor
the
boldest
of
charles
captains
could
have
shown
him
where
to
find
resources
for
prolonging
the
war
and
least
of
all
could
any
human
skill
have
predicted
the
quarter

was
to
come
to
orleans
and
to
france
in

village
of

incursion

the
district
where
she
dwelt
had
escaped
comparatively
free
from
the
ravages
of
war
but
the
approach
of
roving
bands
of
burgundian
or
english
troops
frequently
spread
terror
through
domremy
once
the
village
had
been
plundered
by
some
of
these
marauders
and
joan
and
her
family
had
been
driven
from
their
home
and
forced
to
seek
refuge
for
a
time
at
neufchateau
the
peasantry
in
domremy
were
principally
attached
to
the
house
of
orleans
and
the
dauphin
and
all
the
miseries
which
france
endured
were
there
imputed
to
the
burgundian
faction
and
their
allies
the
english
who
were
seeking
to
enslave
unhappy
france
thus
from
infancy
to
girlhood
joan
had
heard
continually
of
the
woes
of
the
war
and
she
had
herself
witnessed
some
of
the
wretchedness
that
it
caused
a
feeling
of
intense
patriotism
grew
in
her
with
her
growth
the
deliverance
of
france
from
the
english
was
the
subject
of
her
reveries
by
day
and
her
dreams
by
night
blended
with
these
aspirations
were
recollections
of
the
miraculous
interpositions
of
heaven
in
favour
of
the
oppressed
which
she
had
learned
from
the
legends
of
her
church
her
faith
was
undoubting
her
prayers
were
fervent
she
feared
no
danger
for
she
felt
no
sin
and
at
length
she
believed
herself
to
have
received
the
supernatural
inspiration
which
she
sought
according
to
her
own
narrative
delivered
by
her
to
her
merciless
inquisitors
in
the
time
of
her
captivity
and
approaching
death
she
was
about
thirteen
years
old
when
her
revelations
commenced
her
own
words

best
proces
de

vol
p
at
the
age
of
thirteen
a
voice
from
god
came
near
to
her
to
help
her
in
ruling
herself
and
that
voice
came
to
her
about
the
hour
of
noon
in
summer
time
while
she
was
in
her
father
garden
and
she
had
fasted
the
day
before
and
she
heard
the
voice
on
her
right
in
the
direction
of
the
church
and
when
she
heard
the
voice
she
also
saw
a
bright
light
afterwards
michael
and
margaret
and
catherine
appeared
to
her
they
were
always
in
a
halo
of
glory
she
could
see
that
their
heads
were
crowned
with
jewels
and
she
heard
their
voices
which
were
sweet
and
mild
she
did
not
distinguish
their
arms
or
limbs
she
heard
them
more
frequently
than
she
saw
them
and
the
usual
time
when
she
heard
them
was
when
the
church
bells
were
sounding
for
prayer
and
if
she
was
in
the
woods
when
she
heard
them
she
could
plainly
distinguish
their
voices
drawing
near
to
her
when
she
thought
that
she
discerned
the
heavenly
voices
she
knelt
down
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground
their
presence
gladdened
her
even
to
tears
and
after
they
departed
she
wept
because
they
had
not
taken
her
with
them
back
to
paradise
they
always
spoke
soothingly
to
her
they
told
her
that
france
would
be
saved
and
that
she
was
to
save
it
such
were
the
visions
and
the
voices
that
moved
the
spirit
of
the
girl
of
thirteen
and
as
she
grew
older
they
became
more
frequent
and
more
clear
at
last
the
tidings
of
the
siege
of
orleans
reached
domremy
joan
heard
her
parents
and
neighbours
talk
of
the
sufferings
of
its
population
of
the
ruin
which
its
capture
would
bring
on
their
lawful
sovereign
and
of
the
distress
of
the
dauphin
and
his
court
joan
heart
was
sorely
troubled
at
the
thought
of
the
fate
of
orleans
and
her
voices
now
ordered
her
to
leave
her
home
and
warned
her
that
she
was
the
instrument
chosen
by
heaven
for
driving
away
the
english
from
that
city
and
for
taking
the
dauphin
to
be
anointed
king
at
rheims
at
length
she
informed
her
parents
of
her
divine
mission
and
told
them
that
she
must
go
to
the
sire
de
baudricourt
who
commanded
at
vaucouleurs
and
who
was
the
appointed
person
to
bring
her
into
the
presence
of
the
king
whom
she
was
to
save
neither
the
anger
nor
the
grief
of
her
parents
who
said
that
they
would
rather
see
her
drowned
than
exposed
to
the
contamination
of
the
camp
could
move
her
from
her
purpose
one
of
her
uncles
consented
to
take
her
to
vaucouleurs
where
de
baudricourt
at
first
thought
her
mad
and
derided
her
but
by
degrees
was
led
to
believe
if
not
in
her
inspiration
at
least
in
her
enthusiasm
and
in
its
possible
utility
to
the
dauphin
cause
the
inhabitants
of
vaucouleurs
were
completely
won
over
to
her
side
by
the
piety
and
devoutness
which
she
displayed
and
by
her
firm
assurance
in
the
truth
of
her
mission
she
told
them
that
it
was
god
will
that
she
should
go
to
the
king
and
that
no
one
but
her
could
save
the
kingdom
of
france
she
said
that
she
herself
would
rather
remain
with
her
poor
mother
and
spin
but
the
lord
had
ordered
her
forth
the
fame
of
the
maid
as
she
was
termed
the
renown
of
her
holiness
and
of
her
mission
spread
far
and
wide
baudricourt
sent
her
with
an
escort
to
chinon
where
the
dauphin
charles
was
dallying
away
his
time
her
voices
had
bidden
her
assume
the
arms
and
the
apparel
of
a
knight
and
the
wealthiest
inhabitants
of
vaucouleurs
had
vied
with
each
other
in
equipping
her
with
warhorse
armour
and
sword
on
reaching
chinon
she
was
after
some
delay
admitted
into
the
presence
of
the
dauphin
charles
designedly
dressed
himself
far
less
richly
than
many
of
his
courtiers
were
apparelled
and
mingled
with
them
when
jean
was
introduced
in
order
to
see
if
the
holy
maid
would
address
her
exhortations
to
the
wrong
person
but
she
instantly
singled
him
out
and
kneeling
before
him
said
most
noble
dauphin
the
king
of
heaven
announces
to
you
by
me
that
you
shall
be
anointed
and
crowned
king
in
the
city
of
rheims
and
that
you
shall
be
his
viceregent
in
france
his
features
may
probably
have
been
seen
by
her
previously
in
portraits
or
have
been
described
to
her
by
others
but
she
herself
believed
that
her
voices
inspired
her
when
she
addressed
the
king
proces
de
jeanne
vol
p
and
the
report
soon
spread
abroad
that
the
holy
maid
had
found
the
king
by
a
miracle
and
this
with
many
other
similar
rumours
augmented
the
renown
and
influence
that
she
now
rapidly
acquired
the
state
of
public
feeling
in
france
was
not
favourable
to
an
enthusiastic
belief
in
divine
interposition
in
favour
of
the
party
that
had
hitherto
been
unsuccessful
and
oppressed
the
humiliations
which
had
befallen
the
french
royal
family
and
nobility
were
looked
on
as
the
just
judgments
of
god
upon
them
for
their
vice
and
impiety
the
misfortunes
that
had
come
upon
france
as
a
nation
were
believed
to
have
been
drawn
down
by
national
sins
the
english
who
had
been
the
instruments
of

wrath
against
france
seemed
now
by
their
pride
and
cruelty
to
be
fitting
objects
of
it
themselves
france
in
that
age
was
a
profoundly
religious
country
there
was
ignorance
there
was
superstition
there
was
bigotry
but
there
was
faith
a
faith
that
itself
worked
true
miracles
even
while
it
believed
in
unreal
ones
at
this
time
also
one
of
those
devotional
movements
began
among
the
clergy
in
france
which
from
time
to
time
occur
in
national
churches
without
it
being
possible
for
the
historian
to
assign
any
adequate
human
cause
for
their
immediate
date
or
extension
numberless
friars
and
priests
traversed
the
rural
districts
and
towns
of
france
preaching
to
the
people
that
they
must
seek
from
heaven
a
deliverance
from
the
pillages
of
the
soldiery
and
the
insolence
of
the
foreign
oppressors

the
idea
of
a
providence
that
works
only
by
general
laws
was
wholly
alien
to
the
feelings
of
the
age
every
political
event
as
well
as
every
natural
phenomenon
was
believed
to
be
the
immediate
result
of
a
special
mandate
of
god
this
led
to
the
belief
that
his
holy
angels
and
saints
were
constantly
employed
in
executing
his
commands
and
mingling
in
the
affairs
of
men
the
church
encouraged
these
feelings
and
at
the
same
time
sanctioned
the
concurrent
popular
belief
that
hosts
of
evil
spirits
were
also
ever
actively
interposing
in
the
current
of
earthly
events
with
whom
sorcerers
and
wizards
could
league
themselves
and
thereby
obtain
the
exercise
of
supernatural
power
thus
all
things
favoured
the
influence
which
joan
obtained
both
over
friends
and
foes
the
french
nation
as
well
as
the
english
and
the
burgundians
readily
admitted
that
superhuman
beings
inspired
her
the
only
question
was
whether
these
beings
were
good
or
evil
angels
whether
she
brought
with
her
airs
from
heaven
or
blasts
from
hell
this
question
seemed
to
her
countrymen
to
be
decisively
settled
in
her
favour
by
the
austere
sanctity
of
her
life
by
the
holiness
of
her
conversation
but
still
more
by
her
exemplary
attention
to
all
the
services
and
rites
of
the
church
the
dauphin
at
first
feared
the
injury
that
might
be
done
to
his
cause
if
he
had
laid
himself
open
to
the
charge
of
having
leagued
himself
with
a
sorceress
every
imaginable
test
therefore
was
resorted
to
in
order
to
set
joan
orthodoxy
and
purity
beyond
suspicion
at
last
charles
and
his
advisers
felt
safe
in
accepting
her
services
as
those
of
a
true
and
virtuous
daughter
of
the
holy
church
it
is
indeed
probable
that
charles
himself
and
some
of
his
counsellors
may
have
suspected
joan
of
being
a
mere
enthusiast
and
it
is
certain
that
dunois
and
others
of
the
best
generals
took
considerable
latitude
in
obeying
or
deviating
from
the
military
orders
that
she
gave
but
over
the
mass
of
the
people
and
the
soldiery
her
influence
was
unbounded
while
charles
and
his
doctors
of
theology
and
court
ladies
had
been
deliberating
as
to
recognising
or
dismissing
the
maid
a
considerable
period
had
passed
away
during
which
a
small
army
the
last
gleanings
as
it
seemed
of
the
english
sword
had
been
assembled
at
blois
under
dunois
la

xaintrailles
and
other
chiefs
who
to
their
natural
valour
were
now
beginning
to
unite
the
wisdom
that
is
taught
by
misfortune
it
was
resolved
to
send
joan
with
this
force
and
a
convoy
of
provisions
to
orleans
the
distress
of
that
city
had
now
become
urgent
but
the
communication
with
the
open
country
was
not
entirely
cut
off
the
orleannais
had
heard
of
the
holy
maid
whom
providence
had
raised
up
for
their
deliverance
and
their
messengers
urgently
implored
the
dauphin
to
send
her
to
them
without
delay
joan
appeared
at
the
camp
at
blois
clad
in
a
new
suit
of
brilliant
white
armour
mounted
on
a
stately
black
and
with
a
lance
in
her
right
hand
which
she
had
learned
to
wield
with
skill
and
grace

description
of
her
by

de

quoted
in
the
note
to
michelet
and
see
the
account
of
the
banner
at
orleans
which
is
believed
to
bear
an
authentic
portrait
of
the
maid
in
murray
handbook
for
france
p
her
head
was
unhelmeted
so
that
all
could
behold
her
fair
and
expressive
features
her
and
earnest
eyes
and
her
long
black
hair
which
was
parted
across
her
forehead
and
bound
by
a
ribbon
behind
her
back
she
wore
at
her
side
a
small
and
the
consecrated
sword
marked
on
the
blade
with
five
crosses
which
had
at
her
bidding
been
taken
for
her
from
the
shrine
of
catherine
at
fierbois
a
page
carried
her
banner
which
she
had
caused
to
be
made
and
embroidered
as
her
voices
enjoined
it
was

strewn
with
and
on
it
were
the
words
jhesus
maria
and
the
representation
of
the
saviour
in
his
glory
joan
afterwards
generally
bore
her
banner
herself
in
battle
she
said
that
though
she
loved
her
sword
much
she
loved
her
banner
forty
times
as
much
and
she
loved
to
carry
it
because
it
could
not
kill
any
one
thus
accoutred
she
came
to
lead
the
troops
of
france
who
looked
with
soldierly
admiration
on
her
and
upright
figure
the
skill
with
which
she
managed
her
and
the
easy
grace
with
which
she
handled
her
weapons
her
military
education
had
been
short
but
she
had
availed
herself
of
it
well
she
had
also
the
good
sense
to
interfere
little
with
the
manoeuvres
of
the
troops
leaving
those
things
to
dunois
and
others
whom
she
had
the
discernment
to
recognise
as
the
best
officers
in
the
camp
her
tactics
in
action
were
simple
enough
as
she
herself
described
it
i
used
to
say
to
them
boldly
in
among
the
english
and
then
i
used
to
go
boldly
in
myself
ibid
such
as
she
told
her
inquisitors
was
the
only
spell
she
used
and
it
was
one
of
power
but
while
interfering
little
with
the
military
discipline
of
the
troops
in
all
matters
of
moral
discipline
she
was
inflexibly
strict
all
the
abandoned
followers
of
the
camp
were
driven
away
she
compelled
both
generals
and
soldiers
to
attend
regularly
at
confessional
her
chaplain
and
other
priests
marched
with
the
army
under
her
orders
and
at
every
halt
an
altar
was
set
up
and
the
sacrament
administered
no
oath
or
foul
language
passed
without
punishment
or
censure
even
the
roughest
and
most
hardened
veterans
obeyed
her
they
put
off
for
a
time
the
bestial
coarseness
which
had
grown
on
them
during
a
life
of
bloodshed
and
rapine
they
felt
that
they
must
go
forth
in
a
new
spirit
to
a
new
career
and
acknowledged
the
beauty
of
the
holiness
in
which
the
maid
was
leading

through

by

all
the

around

strove

they
poured
forth
blessings
on

whom

already
considered
their
deliverer

the
words
used
by
two
of
them
afterwards
before
the
tribunal

reversed
the
sentence
but
could
not
restore
the
life
of
the
of

the
people
of
orleans
when
they
first
saw
her
in
their
city
thought
that
it
was
an
angel
from
heaven
that
had
come
down
to
save
them
joan
spoke
gently
in
reply
to
their
acclamations
and
addresses
she
told
them
to
fear
god
and
trust
in
him
for
safety
from
the
fury
of
their
enemies
she
first
went
to
the
principal
church
where
te

was
chaunted
and
then
she
took
up
her
abode
in
the
house
of
jacques
bourgier

of

principal
citizens
and
whose
wife
was
a
matron
of
good
repute
she
refused
to
attend
a
splendid
banquet
which
had
been
provided
for
her
and
passed
nearly
all
her
time
in
prayer
when
it
was
known
by
the
english
that
the
maid
was
in
orleans
their
minds
were
not
less
occupied
about
her
than
were
the
minds
of
those
in
the
city
but
it
was
in
a
very
different
spirit
the
english
believed
in
her
supernatural
mission
as
firmly
as
the
french
did
but
they
thought
her
a
sorceress
who
had
come
to
overthrow
them
by
her
enchantments
an
old
prophecy
which
told
that
a
damsel
from
lorraine
was
to
save
france
had
long
been
current
and
it
was
known
and
applied
to
joan
by
foreigners
as
well
as
by
the
natives
for
months
the
english
had
heard
of
the
coming
maid
and
the
tales
of
miracles
which
she
was
said
to
have
wrought
had
been
listened
to
by
the
rough
yeomen
of
the
english
camp
with
anxious
curiosity
and
secret
awe
she
had
sent
a
herald
to
the
english
generals
before
she
marched
for
orleans
and
he
had
summoned
the
english
generals
in
the
name
of
the
most
high
to
give
up
to
the
maid
who
was
sent
by
heaven
the
keys
of
the
french
cities
which
they
had
wrongfully
taken
and
he
also
solemnly
adjured
the
english
troops
whether
archers
or
men
of
the
companies
of
war
or
gentlemen
or
others
who
were
before
the
city
of
orleans
to
depart
thence
to
their
homes
under
peril
of
being
visited
by
the
judgment
of
god
on
her
arrival
in
orleans
joan
sent
another
similar
message
but
the
english
scoffed
at
her
from
their
towers
and
threatened
to
burn
her
heralds
she
determined
before
she
shed
the
blood
of
the
besiegers
to
repeat
the
warning
with
her
own
voice
and
accordingly
she
mounted
one
of
the
boulevards
of
the
town
which
was
within
hearing
of
the
tourelles
and
thence
she
spoke
to
the
english
and
bade
them
depart
otherwise
they
would
meet
with
shame
and
woe
sir
william
gladsdale
whom
the
french
call
glacidas
commanded
the
english
post
at
the
tourelles
and
he
and
another
english
officer
replied
by
bidding
her
go
home
and
keep
her
cows
and
by
ribald
jests
that
brought
tears
of
shame
and
indignation
into
her
eyes
but
though
the
english
leaders
vaunted
aloud
the
effect
produced
on
their
army
by
joan
presence
in
orleans
was
proved
four
days
after
her
arrival
when
on
the
approach
of
reinforcements
and
stores
to
the
town
joan
and
la
hire
marched
out
to
meet
them
and
escorted
the
long
train
of
provision
waggons
safely
into
orleans
between
the
bastilles
of
the
english
who
cowered
behind
their
walls
instead
of
charging
fiercely
and
fearlessly
as
had
been
their
wont
on
any
french
band
that
dared
to
show
itself
within
reach
thus
far
she
had
prevailed
without
striking
a
blow
but
the
time
was
now
come
to
test
her
courage
amid
the
horrors
of
actual
slaughter
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
on
which
she
had
escorted
the
reinforcements
into
the
city
while
she
was
resting
fatigued
at
home
dunois
had
seized
an
advantageous
opportunity
of
attacking
the
english
bastille
of
loup
and
a
fierce
assault
of
the
orleannais
had
been
made
on
it
which
the
english
garrison
of
the
fort
stubbornly
resisted
joan
was
roused
by
a
sound
which
she
believed
to
be
that
of
her
heavenly
voices
she
called
for
her
arms
and
horse
and
quickly
equipping
herself
she
mounted
to
ride
off
to
where
the
fight
was
raging
in
her
haste
she
had
forgotten
her
banner
she
rode
back
and
without
dismounting
had
it
given
to
her
from
the
window
and
then
she
galloped
to
the
gate
whence
the
sally
had
been
made
on
her
way
she
met
some
of
the
wounded
french
who
had
been
carried
back
from
the
fight
ha
she
exclaimed
i
never
can
see
french
blood
flow
without
my
hair
standing
on
end
she
rode
out
of
the
gate
and
met
the
tide
of
her
countrymen
who
had
been
repulsed
from
the
english
fort
and
were
flying
back
to
orleans
in
confusion
at
the
sight
of
the
holy
maid
and
her
banner
they
rallied
and
renewed
the
assault
joan
rode
forward
at
their
head
waving
her
banner
and
cheering
them
on
the
english
quailed
at
what
they
believed
to
be
the
charge
of
hell
loup
was
stormed
and
its
defenders
put
to
the
sword
except
some
few
whom
jean
succeeded
in
saving
all
her
woman
gentleness
returned
when
the
combat
was
over
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
ever
seen
a
she
wept
at
the
sight
of
so
many
and
mangled
corpses
and
her
tears
flowed
doubly
when
she
reflected
that
they
were
the
bodies
of
christian
men
who
had
died
without
confession
the
next
day
was
and
it
was
passed
by
joan
in
prayer
but
on
the
following
morrow
it
was
resolved
by
the
chiefs
of
the
garrison
to
attack
the
english
forts
on
the
south
of
the
river
for
this
purpose
they
crossed
the
river
in
boats
and
after
some
severe
fighting
in
which
the
maid
was
wounded
in
the
heel
both
the
english
bastilles
of
the
augustins
and
jean
de
blanc
were
captured
the
tourelles
were
now
the
only
post
which
the
besiegers
held
on
the
south
of
the
river
but
that
post
was
formidably
strong
and
by
its
command
of
the
bridge
it
was
the
key
to
the
deliverance
of
orleans
it
was
known
that
a
fresh
english
army
was
approaching
under
falstolfe
to
reinforce
the
besiegers
and
should
that
army
arrive
while
the
tourelles
were
yet
in
the
possession
of
their
comrades
there
was
great
peril
of
all
the
advantages
which
the
french
had
gained
being
nullified
and
of
the
siege
being
again
actively
carried
on
it
was
resolved
therefore
by
the
french
to
assail
the
tourelles
at
once
while
the
enthusiasm
which
the
presence
and
the
heroic
valour
of
the
maid
had
created
was
at
its
height
but
the
enterprise
was
difficult
the
rampart
of
the
or
landward
bulwark
of
the
tourelles
was
steep
and
high
and
sir
john
gladsdale
occupied
this
fort
with
five
hundred
archers
and
who
were
the
very
flower
of
the
english
army
early
in
the
morning
of
the
of
may
some
thousands
of
the
best
french
troops
in
orleans
heard
mass
and
attended
the
confessional
by
joan
orders
and
then
crossing
the
river
in
boats
as
on
the
preceding
day
they
assailed
the
bulwark
of
the
tourelles
with
light
hearts
and
heavy
hands
but
gladsdale
men
encouraged
by
their
bold
and
skilful
leader
made
a
resolute
and
able
defence
the
maid
planted
her
banner
on
the
edge
of
the
fosse
and
then
springing
down
into
the
ditch
she
placed
the
first
ladder
against
the
wall
and
began
to
mount
an
english
archer
sent
an
arrow
at
her
which
pierced
her
corslet
and
wounded
her
severely
between
the
neck
and
shoulder
she
fell
bleeding
from
the
ladder
and
the
english
were
leaping
down
from
the
wall
to
capture
her
but
her
followers
bore
her
off
she
was
carried
to
the
rear
and
laid
upon
the
grass
her
armour
was
taken
off
and
the
anguish
of
her
wound
and
the
sight
of
her
blood
made
her
at
first
tremble
and
weep
but
her
confidence
in
her
celestial
mission
soon
returned
her
patron
saints
seemed
to
stand
before
her
and
reassure
her
she
sate
up
and
drew
the
arrow
out
with
her
own
hands
some
of
the
soldiers
who
stood
by
wished
to
stanch
the
blood
by
saying
a
charm
over
the
wound
but
she
forbade
them
saying
that
she
did
not
wish
to
be
cured
by
unhallowed
means
she
had
the
wound
dressed
with
a
little
oil
and
then
bidding
her
confessor
come
to
her
she
betook
herself
to
prayer
in
the
meanwhile
the
english
in
the
bulwark
of
the
tourelles
had
repulsed
the
efforts
of
the
french
to
scale
the
wall
dunois
who
commanded
the
assailants
was
at
first
discouraged
and
gave
orders
for
a
retreat
to
be
sounded
joan
sent
for
him
and
the
other
generals
and
implored
them
not
to
despair
by
my
god
she
said
to
them
you
shall
soon
enter
in
there
do
not
doubt
it
when
you
see
my
banner
wave
again
up
to
the
wall
to
your
arms
again
the
fort
is
yours
for
the
present
rest
a
little
and
take
some
food
and
drink
they
did
so
says
the
old
chronicler
of
the
siege
journal
du
siege
p
for
they
obeyed
her
marvellously
the
faintness
caused
by
her
wound
had
now
passed
off
and
she
headed
the
french
in
another
rush
against
the
bulwark
the
english
who
had
thought
her
slain
were
alarmed
at
her
reappearance
while
the
french
pressed
furiously
and
fanatically
forward
a
biscayan
soldier
was
carrying
joan
banner
she
had
told
the
troops
that
directly
the
banner
touched
the
wall
they
should
enter
the
biscayan
waved
the
banner
forward
from
the
edge
of
the
fosse
and
touched
the
wall
with
it
and
then
all
the
french
host
swarmed
madly
up
the
ladders
that
now
were
raised
in
all
directions
against
the
english
fort
at
this
crisis
the
efforts
of
the
english
garrison
were
distracted
by
an
attach
from
another
quarter
the
french
troops
who
had
been
left
in
orleans
had
placed
some
planks
over
the
broken
part
of
the
bridge
and
advanced
across
them
to
the
assault
of
the
tourelles
on
the
northern
side
gladsdale
resolved
to
withdraw
his
men
from
the
landward
bulwark
and
concentrate
his
whole
force
in
the
tourelles
themselves
he
was
passing
for
this
purpose
across
the
drawbridge
that
connected
the
tourelles
and
the
when
joan
who
by
this
time
had
scaled
the
wall
of
the
bulwark
called
out
to
him
surrender
surrender
to
the
king
of
heaven
ah
glacidas
you
have
foully
wronged
me
with
your
words
but
i
have
great
pity
on
your
soul
and
the
souls
of
your
men
the
englishman
disdainful
of
her
summons
was
striding
on
across
the
drawbridge
when
a
from
the
town
carried
it
away
and
gladsdale
perished
in
the
water
that
ran
beneath
after
his
fall
the
remnant
of
the
english
abandoned
all
further
resistance
three
hundred
of
them
had
been
killed
in
the
battle
and
two
hundred
were
made
prisoners
the
broken
arch
was
speedily
repaired
by
the
exulting
orleannais
and
joan
made
her
triumphal
into
the
city
by
the
bridge
that
had
so
long
been
closed
every
church
in
orleans
rang
out
its
gratulating
peal
and
throughout
the
night
the
sounds
of
rejoicing
echoed
and
the
bonfires
blazed
up
from
the
city
but
in
the
lines
and
forts
which
the
besiegers
yet
retained
on
the
northern
shore
there
was
anxious
watching
of
the
generals
and
there
was
desponding
gloom
among
the
soldiery
even
talbot
now
counselled
retreat
on
the
following
morning
the
orleannais
from
their
walls
saw
the
great
forts
called
london
and
lawrence
in
flames
and
witnessed
their
invaders
busy
in
destroying
the
stores
and
munitions
which
had
been
relied
on
for
the
destruction
of
orleans
slowly
and
sullenly
the
english
army
retired
but
not
before
it
had
drawn
up
in
battle
array
opposite
to
the
city
as
if
to
challenge
the
garrison
to
an
encounter
the
french
troops
were
eager
to
go
out
and
attack
but
joan
forbade
it
the
day
was
sunday
in
the
name
of
god
she
said
let
them
depart
and
let
us
return
thanks
to
god
she
led
the
soldiers
and
citizens
forth
from
orleans
but
not
for
the
shedding
of
blood
they
passed
in
solemn
procession
round
the
city
walls
and
then
while
their
retiring
enemies
were
yet
in
sight
they
knelt
in
thanksgiving
to
god
for
the
deliverance
which
he
had
vouchsafed
them
within
three
months
from
the
time
of
her
first
interview
with
the
dauphin
joan
had
fulfilled
the
first
part
of
her
promise
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
orleans
within
three
months
more
she
fulfilled
the
second
part
also
and
she
stood
with
her
banner
in
her
hand
by
the
high
altar
at
rheims
while
he
was
anointed
and
crowned
as
king
charles
vii
of
france
in
the
interval
she
had
taken
jargeau
troyes
and
other
strong
places
and
she
had
defeated
an
english
army
in
a
fair
field
at
patay
the
enthusiasm
of
her
countrymen
knew
no
bounds
but
the
importance
of
her
services
and
especially
of
her
primary
achievement
at
orleans
may
perhaps
be
best
proved
by
the
testimony
of
her
enemies
there
is
extant
a
fragment
of
a
letter
from
the
regent
bedford
to
his
royal
nephew
henry
in
which
he
bewails
the
turn
that
the
war
had
taken
and
especially
attributes
it
to
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
orleans
by
joan
bedford
own
words
which
are
preserved
in
rymer

and
couraiged
your

and
ennemys
to
assemble
them
forthwith
in
grete
nombre
when
charles
had
been
anointed
king
of
france
joan
believed
that
her
mission
was
accomplished
and
in
truth
the
deliverance
of
france
from
the
english
though
not
completed
for
many
years
afterwards
was
then
insured
the
ceremony
of
a
royal
coronation
and
anointment
was
not
in
those
days
regarded
as
a
mere
costly
formality
it
was
believed
to
confer
the
sanction
and
the
grace
of
heaven
upon
the
prince
who
had
previously
ruled
with
mere
human
authority
thenceforth
he
was
the
lord
anointed
moreover
one
of
the
difficulties
that
had
previously
lain
in
the
way
of
many
frenchman
when
called
on
to
support
charles
vii
was
now
removed
he
had
been
publicly
stigmatised
even
by
his
own
parents
as
no
true
son
of
the
royal
race
of
france
the
the
english
and
the
partisans
of
burgundy
called
him
the
pretender
to
the
title
of
dauphin
but
those
who
had
been
led
to
doubt
his
legitimacy
were
cured
of
their
scepticism
by
the
victories
of
the
holy
maid
and
by
the
fulfilment
of
her
pledges
they
thought
that
heaven
had
now
declared
itself
in
favour
of
charles
as
the
true
heir
of
the
crown
of
louis
and
the
tales
about
his
being
spurious
were
thenceforth
regarded
as
mere
english
calumnies
with
this
strong
tide
of
national
feeling
in
his
favour
with
victorious
generals
and
soldiers
round
him
and
a
dispirited
and
divided
enemy
before
him
he
could
not
fail
to
conquer
though
his
own
imprudence
and
misconduct
and
the
stubborn
valour
which
some
of
the
english
still
displayed
prolonged
the
war
in
france
nearly
to
the
time
when
the
civil
war
of
the
roses
broke
out
in
england
and
insured
for
france
peace
and
repose
joan
knelt
before
the
king
in
the
cathedral
of
rheims
and
shed
tears
of
joy
she
said
that
she
had
then
fulfilled
the
work
which
the
lord
had
commanded
her
the
young
girl
now
asked
for
her
dismissal
she
wished
to
return
to
her
peasant
home
to
tend
her
parent
flocks
again
and
to
live
at
her
own
will
in
her
native
village
je
voudrais
bien
voulut
me
faire
ramener
aupres
mes
pere
et
mere
et
garder
leurs
brebis
et
betail
et
faire
ce
que
je
voudrois
faire
she
had
always
believed
that
her
career
would
be
a
short
one
but
charles
and
his
captains
were
loth
to
lose
the
presence
of
one
who
had
such
an
influence
upon
the
soldiery
and
the
people
they
persuaded

stay
with
the
army
she
still
showed
the
same
bravery
and
zeal
for
the
cause
of
france
she
was
as
fervent
as
before
in
her
prayers
and
as
exemplary
in
all
religious
duties
she
still
heard
her
heavenly
voices
but
she
now
no
longer
thought
herself
the
appointed
minister
of
heaven
to
lead
her
countrymen
to
certain
victory
our
admiration
for
her
courage
and
patriotism
ought
to
be
increased
a
by
her
conduct
throughout
the
latter
part
of
her
career
amid
dangers
against
which
she
no
longer
believed
herself
to
be
divinely
secured
indeed
she
believed
herself
doomed

us
trace
the
fate
of

she
had
saved

country
she
served
well
with

and
other
strong
places
but
in
a
premature
attack
on
paris
in
september
the
french
were
repulsed
and
joan
was
severely
wounded
in
the
winter
she
was
again
in
the
field
with
some
of
the
french
troops
and
in
the
following
spring
she
threw
herself
into
the
fortress
of
compeigne
which
she
had
herself
won
for
the
french
king
in
the
preceding
autumn
and
which
was
now
besieged
by
a
strong
burgundian
force
she
was
taken
prisoner
in
a
sally
from
compeigne
on
the
of
may
and
was
imprisoned
by
the
burgundians
first
at
arras
and
then
at
a
place
called
crotoy
on
the
flemish
coast
until
november
when
for
payment
of
a
large
sum
of
money
she
was
given
up
to
the
english
and
taken
to
rouen
which
was
then
their
main
stronghold
in
france
sorrow
it

shame
to
tell
the
butchery
that
there
befell

the
revolting
details
of
the
cruelties
practised

this
young
girl

on
a
subject
which
is
to
an

one
of
painful
interest
there

will
add

one
remark
on
the
character
of
the
truest
heroine
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
if
any
person
can
be
found
in

who
would
join

herself
inspired

that

let
him

of
the
heavenly

which
socrates

himself

on
the
afternoon
of

of

a
group
of
english
captains
was
collected
at
the
bowling

on
the
hoe
at
plymouth
whose
equals
have
never
before
or
since
been
brought
together
even
at
that
favourite
of
the
heroes
of
the
british
navy
there
was
sir
francis
drake
the
first
english
circumnavigator
of
the
globe
the
terror
of
every
spanish
coast
in
the
old
world
and

there
was
sir
john
hawkins
the
rough
veteran
of
many
a
daring
voyage
on
the
african
and
american
seas
and
of
many
a
desperate
battle
there
was
sir
martin
frobisher
one
of
the
earliest
explorers
of
the
arctic
seas
in
search
of
that
passage
which
is
still
the
darling
object
of
england
boldest
mariners
there
was
the
of
england
lord
howard
of
effingham
prodigal
of
all
things
in
his
country
cause
and
who
had
recently
had
the
noble
daring
to
refuse
to
dismantle
part
of
the
fleet
though
the
queen
had
sent
him
orders
to
do
so
in
consequence
of
an
exaggerated
report
that
the
enemy
had
been
driven
back
and
shattered
by
a
storm
lord
howard
whom
contemporary
writers
describe
as
being
of
a
wise
and
noble
courage
skilful
in
sea
matters
wary
and
provident
and
of
great
esteem
among
the
sailors
resolved
to
risk
his
anger
and
to
keep
the
ships
afloat
at
his
own
charge
rather
than
that
england
should
run
the
peril
of
losing
their
protection
another
of
our
elizabethan
sir
walter
raleigh
was
at
that
time
commissioned
to
raise
and
equip
the
of
cornwall
but
as
he
was
also
commander
of
plymouth
we
may
well
believe
that
he
must
have
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
of
consulting
with
the
and
other
high
officers
which
was
offered
by
the
english
fleet
putting
into
that
port
and
we
may
look
on
raleigh
as
one
of
the
group
that
was
assembled
at
the
bowling
green
on
the
hoe
many
other
brave
men
and
skilful
mariners
besides
the
chiefs
whose
names
have
been
mentioned
were
there
enjoying
with
true
merriment
their
temporary
relaxation
from
duty
in
the
harbour
lay
the
english
fleet
with
which
they
had
just
returned
from
a
cruise
to
corunna
in
search
of
information
respecting
the
real
condition
and
movements
of
the
hostile
armada
lord
howard
had
ascertained
that
our
enemies
though
were
still
formidably
strong
and
fearing
that
part
of
their
fleet
might
make
for
england
in
his
absence
he
had
hurried
back
to
the
devonshire
coast
he
resumed
his
station
at
plymouth
and
waited
there
for
certain
tidings
of
the
spaniard
approach
a
match
at
bowls
was
being
played
in
which
drake
and
other
high
officers
of
the
fleet
were
engaged
when
a
small
armed
vessel
was
seen
running
before
the
wind
into
plymouth
harbour
with
all
sails
set
her
commander
landed
in
haste
and
eagerly
sought
the
place
where
the
english
and
his
captains
were
standing
his
name
was
fleming
he
was
the
master
of
a
scotch
privateer
and
he
told
the
english
officers
that
he
had
that
morning
seen
the
spanish
armada
off
the
cornish
coast
at
this
exciting
information
the
captains
began
to
hurry
down
to
the
water
and
there
was
a
shouting
for
the
ship
boats
but
drake
coolly
checked
his
comrades
and
insisted
that
the
match
should
be
played
out
he
said
that
there
was
plenty
of
time
both
to
win
the
game
and
beat
the
spaniards
the
best
and
bravest
match
that
ever
was
scored
was
resumed
accordingly
drake
and
his
friends
aimed
their
last
bowls
with
the
same
steady
calculating
coolness
with
which
they
were
about
to
point
their
guns
the
winning
cast
was
made
and
then
they
went
on
board
and
prepared
for
action
with
their
hearts
as
light
and
their
nerves
as
firm
as
they
had
been
on
the
hoe
bowling
green
meanwhile
the
messengers
and
signals
had
been
despatched
fast
and
far
through
england
to
warn
each
town
and
village
that
the
enemy
had
come
at
last
in
every
seaport
there
was
instant
making
ready
by
land
and
by
sea
in
every
shire
and
every
city
there
was
instant
mustering
of
horse
and
man
in
macaulay
ballad
on
the
spanish
armada
the
transmission
of
the
tidings
of
the
armada
approach
and
the
arming
of
the
english
nation
are
magnificently
described
the
progress
of
the
is
depicted
in
lines
which
are
worthy
of
comparison
with
the
renowned
passage
in
the
agamemnon
which
describes
the
transmission
of
the
announcing
the
fall
of
troy
from
mount
ida
to
argos
but
england
best
defence
then
as
ever
was
her
fleet
and
after
warping
laboriously
out
of
plymouth
harbour
against
the
wind
the
stood
westward
under
easy
sail
keeping
an
anxious
for
the
armada
the
approach
of
which
was
soon
announced
by
cornish
and
signals
from
the
cornish
cliffs
the
england
of
our
own
days
is
so
strong
and
the
spain
of
our
own
days
is
so
feeble
that
it
is
not
possible
without
some
reflection
and
care
to
comprehend
the
full
extent
of
the
peril
which
england
then
ran
from
the
power
and
the
ambition
of
spain
or
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
that
crisis
in
the
history
of
the
world
we
had
then
no
indian
or
colonial
empire
save
the
feeble
germs
of
our
north
american
settlements
which
raleigh
and
gilbert
had
recently
planted
scotland
was
a
separate
kingdom
and
ireland
was
then
even
a
greater
source
of
weakness
and
a
worse
nest
of
rebellion
than
she
has
been
in
after
times
queen
elizabeth
had
found
at
her
accession
an
encumbered
revenue
a
divided
people
and
an
unsuccessful
foreign
war
in
which
the
last
remnant
of
our
possessions
in
france
had
been
lost
she
had
also
a
formidable
pretender
to
her
crown
whose
interests
were
favoured
by
all
the
roman
catholic
powers
and
even
some
of
her
subjects
were
warped
by
religious
bigotry
to
deny
her
title
and
to
look
on
her
as
an
heretical
usurper
it
is
true
that
during
the
years
of
her
reign
which
had
passed
away
before
the
attempted
invasion
of
she
had
revived
the
commercial
prosperity
the
national
spirit
and
the
national
loyalty
of
england
but
her
resources
to
cope
with
the
colossal
power
of
philip
still
seemed
most
scanty
and
she
had
not
a
single
foreign
ally
except
the
dutch
who
were
themselves
struggling
hard
and
as
it
seemed
hopelessly
to
maintain
their
revolt
against
spain
on
the
other
hand
philip
ii
was
absolute
master
of
an
empire
so
superior
to
the
other
states
of
the
world
in
extent
in
resources
and
especially
in
military
and
naval
forces
as
to
make
the
project
of
enlarging
that
empire
into
a
universal
monarchy
seem
a
perfectly
feasible
scheme
and
philip
had
both
the
ambition
to
form
that
project
and
the
resolution
to
devote
all
his
energies
and
all
his
means
to
its
realization
since
the
downfall
of
the
roman
empire
no
such
preponderating
power
had
existed
in
the
world
during
the
mediaeval
centuries
the
chief
european
kingdoms
were
slowly
moulding
themselves
out
of
the
feudal
chaos
and
though
their
wars
with
each
other
were
numerous
and
desperate
and
several
of
their
respective
kings
figured
for
a
time
as
mighty
conquerors
none
of
them
in
those
times
acquired
the
consistency
and
perfect
organization
which
are
requisite
for
a
career
of
aggrandizement
after
the
consolidation
of
the
great
kingdoms
they
for
some
time
kept
each
other
in
mutual
check
during
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
balancing
system
was
successfully
practised
by
european
statesmen
but
when
philip
ii
reigned
france
had
become
so
miserably
weak
through
her
civil
wars
that
he
had
nothing
to
dread
from
the
rival
state
which
had
so
long
curbed
his
father
the
emperor
charles
in
germany
italy
and
poland
he
had
either
zealous
friends
and
dependents
or
weak
and
divided
enemies
against
the
turks
he
had
gained
great
and
glorious
successes
and
he
might
look
round
the
continent
of
europe
without
discerning
a
single
antagonist
of
whom
he
could
stand
in
awe
spain
when
he
acceded
to
the
throne
was
at
the
zenith
of
her
power
the
hardihood
and
spirit
which
the
arragonese
the
castilians
and
the
other
nations
of
the
peninsula
had
acquired
during
centuries
of
free
institutions
and
successful
war
against
the
moors
had
not
yet
become
obliterated
charles
had
indeed
destroyed
the
liberties
of
spain
but
that
had
been
done
too
recently
for
its
full
evil
to
be
felt
in
philip
time
a
people
can
not
be
debased
in
a
single
generation
and
the
spaniards
under
charles
and
philip
ii
proved
the
truth
of
the
remark
that
no
nation
is
ever
so
formidable
to
its
neighbours
for
a
time
as
is
a
nation
which
after
being
trained
up
in
passes
suddenly
under
a
despotic
ruler
the
energy
of
democratic
institutions
survives
for
a
few
generations
and
to
it
are
superadded
the
decision
and
certainty
which
are
the
attributes
of
government
when
all
its
powers
are
directed
by
a
single
mind
it
is
true
that
this
vigour
is
national
corruption
and
debasement
gradually
follow
the
loss
of
the
national
liberties
but
there
is
an
interval
before
their
workings
are
felt
and
in
that
interval
the
most
ambitious
schemes
of
foreign
conquest
are
often
successfully
undertaken
philip
had
also
the
advantage
of
finding
himself
at
the
head
of
a
large
standing
army
in
a
perfect
state
of
discipline
and
equipment
in
an
age
when
except
some
few
insignificant
corps
standing
armies
were
unknown
in
christendom
the
renown
of
the
spanish
troops
was
justly
high
and
the
infantry
in
particular
was
considered
the
best
in
the
world
his
fleet
also
was
far
more
numerous
and
better
appointed
than
that
of
any
other
european
power
and
both
his
soldiers
and
his
sailors
had
the
confidence
in
themselves
and
their
commanders
which
a
long
career
of
successful
warfare
alone
can
create
besides
the
spanish
crown
philip
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
of
naples
and

had
indeed
experienced
the
mortification
of
seeing
the
inhabitants
of
the

revolt
against
his
authority
nor
could
he
succeed
in
bringing
back
beneath
the
spanish
sceptre
all
the

which
his

had
bequeathed
to
him
but
he
had
reconquered
a
large
number
of
the

that
originally
took
up

against

belgium
was
brought
more
thoroughly
into

to

than

and
it
was

still

also
formed

side

under
his
great
general
the
prince

had
been
trained
to
act
together
under

was
beyond

the
greatest
military
genius
of
his
age
he
was
also
highly
distinguished
for
political
wisdom
and
sagacity
and
for
his
great
administrative
talents
he
was
idolised
by
his
troops
whose

he
knew
how
to
win
without
relaxing
their

or
diminishing
his

authority
cool
and
circumspect
in
his
plans
but
swift
and
energetic
when
the
moment
arrived
for
striking
a
decisive
blow
neglecting
no

that
caution
could
provide
against
conciliating
even

of

he
attacked
by
his
scrupulous
good

his
moderation
and
his
address

was
one
of
the
most
formidable
generals
that
ever
could
be
placed
at
the

of
an
army
designed
not

to
win
battles
but
to

happy
it
is
for
england
and
the
world
that
this
island
was
saved
from
becoming
an
arena
for
the
exhibition
of
his
powers
whatever
diminution
the
spanish
empire
might
have
sustained
in
the
netherlands
seemed
to
be
more
than
compensated
by
the
acquisition
of
portugal
which
philip
had
completely
conquered
in
not
only
that
ancient
kingdom
itself
but
all
the
fruits
of
the
maritime
enterprises
of

portuguese

fallen

hands
all

acknowledged
the
sovereignty
of
the
king
of
spain
who
thus
not
only
united
the
whole
iberian
peninsula
under
his
single
sceptre
but
had
acquired
a
transmarine
empire
little
inferior
in
wealth

to
that
which
he
had
inherited
at

splendid
victory
which
his
fleet
in
conjunction
with
the
papal
and
venetian
galleys
had
gained
at
lepanto
over
the
turks
had
deservedly
exalted
the
fame
of
the
spanish
marine
throughout
christendom
and
when
philip
had
reigned

the
vigour
of

seemed
unbroken

and
these

at

as

bigots

on
himself
and
was

on
by

as
the
appointed
champion
to
extirpate

a
powerful
reaction
against
protestantism
had
taken
place
since
the
commencement
of
the
second
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
philip
believed
that
he
was
destined
to
complete
it

had
been
thoroughly
rooted

from

in

had
been
subjected
to

severe
oppressions
as

talent

added
that

at

proved
themselves

to

to

country

resolved
on

effort
to
crush

at

thought
it

to
try

in

had
been

powers

seemed
at

to
have
secured
a
great
advantage

in
which

ultimately
prevailed

was
alarmed
at
the
negotiations
that
were
going
on
at
ostend
and
he
especially
dreaded
any
accommodation
between
spain
and
england
in
consequence
of
which
philip
ii
might
be
enabled
to
subdue
the
united
provinces
and
make
himself
master
of
france
in
order
therefore
to
dissuade
elizabeth
from
any
arrangement
he
offered
to
support
her
in
case
she
were
attacked
by
the
spaniards
with
twice
the
number
of
troops
which
he
was
bound
by
the
treaty
of
to
send
to
her
assistance
he
had
a
long
conference
with
her
ambassador
stafford
upon
this
subject
and
told
him
that
the
pope
and
the
catholic
king
had
entered
into
a
league
against
the
queen
his
mistress
and
had
invited
himself
and
the
venetians
to
join
them
but
they
had
refused
to
do
so
the
queen
of
england
he
added
a
peace
with
the
catholic
king
that
peace
will
not
last
three
months
because
the
catholic
king
will
aid
the
league
with
all
his

overthrow
her
and

what
fate
is
reserved

after

in

most
effectually
to
frustrate

proposed
to

to
form
a
still
closer
union
between
the
two
crowns
of
france
and
spain
and
at
the
same
time
he
secretly
despatched
a
confidential
envoy
to
constantinople
to
warn
the
sultan
that
if
he
did
not
again
declare
war
against
the
catholic
king
that
monarch
who
already
possessed
the
netherlands
portugal

circular

occasion
a
larger
proportion
of
furniture

for

horsemen
than
hath
been
certified

to
be
in

against
any

about

as
we

not

by

ourselves
that

bless

borne

called
on
the

for

by

the
appeal
was
responded
to
with
liberal
zeal
that
offered
more
even
than
the
queen
required
the
boasting
threats
of
the
spaniards
had
roused
the
spirit
of
the
nation
and
the
whole
people
were
thoroughly
irritated
to
stir
up
their
whole
forces
for
their
defence
against
such
prognosticated
conquests
so
that
in
a
very
short
time
all
the
whole
realm
and
every
corner
were
furnished
with
armed
men
on
horseback
and
on
foot
and
these
continually
trained
exercised
and
put
into
bands
in
warlike
manner
as
in
no
age
ever
was
before
in
this
realm
there
was
no
sparing
of
money
to
provide
horse
armour
weapons
powder
and
all
necessaries
no
nor
want
of
provision
of
pioneers
carriages
and
victuals
in
every
county
of
the
realm
without
exception
to
attend
upon
the
armies
and
to
this
general
furniture
every
man
voluntarily
offered
very
many
their
services
personally
without
wages
others
money
for
armour
and
weapons
and
to
wage
soldiers
a
matter
strange
and
never
the
like
heard
of
in
this
realm
or
else
where
and
this
general
reason
moved
all
men
to
large
contributions
that
when
a
conquest
was
to
be
withstood
wherein
all
should
be
lost
it
was
no
time
to
spare
a
portion
copy
of
contemporary
letter
in
the
harleian
collection
quoted
by
southey
our
queen
showed
herself
worthy
of
such
a
people
a
camp
was
formed
at
tilbury
and
there
elizabeth
rode
through
the
ranks
encouraging
her
captains
and
her
soldiers
by
her
presence
and
her
words
one
of
the
speeches
which
she
addressed
to
them
during
this
crisis
has
been
preserved
and
though
often
quoted
it
must
not
be
omitted
here
my
loving
people
she
said
we
have
been
persuaded
by
some
that
are
careful
of
our
safety
to
take
heed
how
we
commit
ourselves
to
armed
multitudes
for
fear
of
treachery
but
i
assure
you
i
do
not
desire
to
live
to
distrust
my
faithful
and
loving
people
let
tyrants
fear
i
have
always
so
behaved
myself
that
under
god
i
have
placed
my
chiefest
strength
and
safeguard
in
the
loyal
hearts
and
good
will
of
my
subjects
and
therefore
i
am
come
amongst
you
as
you
see
at
this
time
not
for
my
recreation
or
disport
but
being
resolved
in
the
midst
and
heat
of
the
battle
to
live
or
die
amongst
you
all
to
lay
down
for
my
god
for
my
kingdom
and
for
my
people
my
honour
and
my
blood
even
in
the
dust
i
know
i
have
the
body
but
of
a
weak
and
feeble
woman
but
i
have
the
heart
and
stomach
of
a
king
and
of
a
king
of
england
too
and
think
it
foul
scorn
that
parma
or
spain
or
any
prince
of
europe
should
dare
to
invade
the
borders
of
my
realm
to
which
rather
than
any
dishonour
shall
grow
by
me
i
myself
will
take
up
arms
i
myself
will
be
your
general
judge
and
rewarder
of
every
one
of
your
virtues
in
the
field
i
know
already
for
your
forwardness
you
have
deserved
rewards
and
crowns
and
we
do
assure
you
on
the
word
of
a
prince
they
shall
be
duly
paid
you
in
the
meantime
my
shall
be
in
my
stead
than
whom
never
prince
commanded
a
more
noble
or
worthy
subject
not
doubting
but
by
your
obedience
to
my
general
by
your
concord
in
the
camp
and
your
valour
in
the
field
we
shall
shortly
have
a
famous
victory
over
those
enemies
of
my
god
of
my
kingdom
and
of
my
people
we
have
minute
proofs
of
the
skill
with
which
the
government
of
elizabeth
made
its
preparations
for
the
documents
still
exist
which
were
drawn
up
at
that
time
by
the
ministers
and
military
men
who
were
consulted
by
elizabeth
respecting
the
defence
of
the
country
see
note
in
tytler
life
of
raleigh
p
among
those
summoned
to
the
advice
of
their
queen
at
this
crisis
were
sir
walter
raleigh
lord
grey
sir
francis
knolles
sir
thomas
leighton
sir
john
norris
sir
richard
grenville
sir
richard
bingham
and
sir
roger
williams
and
the
biographer
of
sir
walter
raleigh
observes
that
these
councillors
were
chosen
by
the
queen
as
being
not
only
men
bred
to
arms
and
some
of
them
as
grey
norris
bingham
and
grenville
of
high
military
talents
but
of
grave
experience
in
affairs
of
state
and
in
the
civil
government
of
provinces
qualities
by
no
means
means
unimportant
when
the
debate
referred
not
merely
to
the
leading
of
an
army
or
the
plan
of
a
campaign
but
to
the
organization
of
a
militia
and
the
communication
with
the
magistrates
for
arming
the
peasantry
and
encouraging
them
to
a
resolute
and
simultaneous
resistance
from
some
private
papers
of
lord
burleigh
it
appears
that
sir
walter
took
a
principal
share
in
these
deliberations
and
the
abstract
of
their
proceedings
a
document
still
preserved
is
supposed
to
have
been
drawn
up
by
him
they
first
prepared
a
list
of
places
where
it
was
likely
the
spanish
army
might
attempt
a
descent
as
well
as
of
those
which
lay
most
exposed
to
the
forces
under
the
duke
of
parma
they
next
considered
the
speediest
and
most
effectual
means
of
defence
whether
by
fortification
or
the
muster
of
a
military
array
and
lastly
deliberated
on
the
course
to
be
taken
for
fighting
the
enemy
if
he
should
land
some
of
elizabeth
advisers
recommended
that
the
whole
care
and
resources
of
the
government
should
be
devoted
to
the
equipment
of
the
armies
and
that
the
enemy
when
he
attempted
to
land
should
be
welcomed
with
a
battle
on
the
shore
but
the
wiser
counsels
of
raleigh
and
others
prevailed
who
urged
the
importance
of
fitting
out
a
fleet
that
should
encounter
the
spaniards
at
sea
and
if
possible
prevent
them
from
approaching
the
land
at
all
in
raleigh
great
work
on
the
history
of
the
world
he
takes
occasion
when
discussing
some
of
the
events
of
the
first
punic
war
to
give
his
reasonings
on
the
proper
policy
of
england
when
menaced
with
invasion
without
doubt
we
have
there
the
substance
of
the
advice
which
he
gave
to
elizabeth
council
and
the
remarks
of
such
a
man
on
such
a
subject
have
a
general
and
enduring
interest
beyond
the
immediate
peril
which
called
them
forth
raleigh
historie
of
the
world
pp
says
surely
i
hold
that
the
best
way
is
to
keep
our
enemies
from
treading
upon
our
ground
wherein
if
we
fail
then
must
we
seek
to
make
him
wish
that
he
had
stayed
at
his
own
home
in
such
a
case
if
it
should
happen
our
judgments
are
to
weigh
many
particular
circumstances
that
belongs
not
unto
this
discourse
but
making
the
question
general
the
positive
whether
england
without
the
help
of
her
fleet
be
able
to
debar
an
enemy
from
landing
i
hold
that
it
is
unable
so
to
do
and
therefore
i
think
it
most
dangerous
to
make
the
adventure
for
the
encouragement
of
a
first
victory
to
an
enemy
and
the
discouragement
of
being
beaten
to
the
invaded
may
draw
after
it
a
most
perilous
consequence
great
difference
i
know
there
is
and
a
diverse
consideration
to
be
had
between
such
a
country
as
france
is
strengthened
with
many
fortified
places
and
this
of
ours
where
our
ramparts
are
but
the
bodies
of
men
but
i
say
that
an
army
to
be
transported
over
sea
and
to
be
landed
again
in
an
enemy
country
and
the
place
left
to
the
choice
of
the
invader
can
not
be
resisted
on
the
coast
of
england
without
a
fleet
to
impeach
it
no
nor
on
the
coast
of
france
or
any
other
country
except
every
creek
port
or
sandy
bay
had
a
powerful
army
in
each
of
them
to
make
opposition
for
let
the
supposition
be
granted
that
kent
is
able
to
furnish
twelve
thousand
foot
and
that
those
twelve
thousand
be
layed
in
the
three
best
within
that
country
to
wit
three
thousand
at
margat
three
thousand
at
the
nesse
and
six
thousand
at
foulkstone
that
is
somewhat
equally
distant
from
them
both
as
also
that
two
of
these
troops
unless
some
other
order
be
thought
more
fit
be
directed
to
strengthen
the
third
when
they
shall
see
the
enemies
fleet
to
head
towards
it
i
say
that
notwithstanding
this
provision
if
the
enemy
setting
sail
from
the
isle
of
wight
in
the
first
watch
of
the
night
and
towing
their
long
boats
at
their
sterns
shall
arrive
by
dawn
of
day
at
the
nesse
and
thrust
their
army
on
shore
there
it
will
be
hard
for
those
three
thousand
that
are
at
margat
long
miles
from
thence
to
come
time
enough
to
reinforce
their
fellows
at
the
nesse
nay
how
shall
they
at
foulkstone
be
able
to
do
it
who
are
nearer
by
more
than
half
the
way
seeing
that
the
enemy
at
his
first
arrival
will
either
make
his
entrance
by
force
with
three
or
four
shot
of
great
artillery
and
quickly
put
the
first
three
thousand
that
are
entrenched
at
the
nesse
to
run
or
else
give
them
so
much
to
do
that
they
shall
be
glad
to
send
for
help
to
foulkstone
and
perhaps
to
margat
whereby
those
places
will
be
left
bare
now
let
us
suppose
that
all
the
twelve
thousand
kentish
soldiers
arrive
at
the
nesse
ere
the
enemy
can
be
ready
to
disembarque
his
army
so
that
he
will
find
it
unsafe
to
land
in
the
face
of
so
many
prepared
to
withstand
him
yet
must
we
believe
that
he
will
play
the
best
of
his
own
game
having
liberty
to
go
which
way
he
list
and
under
covert
of
the
night
set
sail
towards
the
east
where
what
shall
hinder
him
to
take
ground
either
at
margat
the
downes
or
elsewhere
before
they
at
the
nesse
can
be
well
aware
of
his
departure
certainly
there
is
nothing
more
easy
than
to
do
it
yea
the
like
may
be
said
of
weymouth
purbeck
poole
and
of
all
on
the
for
there
is
no
man
ignorant
that
ships
without
putting
themselves
out
of
breath
will
easily
outrun
the
souldiers
that
coast
them
armees
ne
volent
point
en
poste
neither
flye
nor
run
post
saith
a
marshal
of
france
and
i
know
it
to
be
true
that
a
fleet
of
ships
may
be
seen
at
sunset
and
after
it
at
the
lizard
yet
by
the
next
morning
they
may
recover
portland
whereas
an
army
of
foot
shall
not
be
able
to
march
it
in
six
dayes
again
when
those
troops
lodged
on
the
shall
be
forced
to
run
from
place
to
place
in
vain
after
a
fleet
of
ships
they
will
at
length
sit
down
in
the
midway
and
leave
all
at
adventure
but
say
it
were
otherwise
that
the
invading
enemy
will
offer
to
land
in
some
such
place
where
there
shall
be
an
army
of
ours
ready
to
receive
him
yet
it
can
not
be
doubted
but
that
when
the
choice
of
all
our
trained
bands
and
the
choice
of
our
commanders
and
captains
shall
be
drawn
together
as
they
were
at
tilbury
in
the
year
to
attend
the
person
of
the
prince
and
for
the
defence
of
the
city
of
london
they
that
remain
to
guard
the
coast
can
be
of
no
such
force
as
to
encounter
an
army
like
unto
that
wherewith
it
was
intended
that
the
prince
of
parma
should
have
landed
in
england
for
end
of
this
digression
i
hope
that
this
question
shall
never
come
to
trial
his
majestie
many
moveable
forts
will
forbid
the
experience
and
although
the
english
will
no
less
disdain
that
any
nation
under
heaven
can
do
to
be
beaten
upon
their
own
ground
or
elsewhere
by
a
foreign
enemy
yet
to
entertain
those
that
shall
assail
us
with
their
own
beef
in
their
bellies
and
before
they
eat
of
our
kentish
capons
i
take
it
to
be
the
wisest
way
to
do
which
his
majesty
after
god
will
employ
his
good
ships
on
the
sea
and
not
trust
in
any
intrenchment
upon
the
shore
the
introduction
of
steam
as
a
propelling
power
at
sea
has
added
tenfold
weight
to
these
arguments
of
raleigh
on
the
other
hand
a
system
of
railways
especially
of
aided
by
the
operation
or
the
electric
telegraph
would
give
facilities
for
concentrating
a
defensive
army
to
oppose
an
enemy
on
landing
and
for
moving
troops
from
place
to
place
in
observation
of
the
movements
of
the
hostile
fleet
such
as
would
have
astonished
sir
walter
even
more
than
the
sight
of
vessels
passing
rapidly
to
and
fro
without
the
aid
of
wind
or
tide
the
observation
of
the
french
marshal
whom
he
quotes
is
now
no
longer
correct
armies
can
be
made
to
pass
from
place
to
place
almost
with
the
speed
of
wings
and
far
more
rapidly
than
any
that
was
known
in
the
elizabethan
or
any
other
age
still
the
presence
of
a
sufficient
armed
force
at
the
right
spot
at
the
right
time
can
never
be
made
a
matter
of
certainty
and
even
after
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
no
one
can
doubt
but
that
the
policy
of
raleigh
is
that
which
england
should
ever
seek
to
follow
in
defensive
war
at
the
time
of
the
armada
that
policy
certainly
saved
the
country
if
not
from
conquest
at
least
from
deplorable
calamities
if
indeed
the
enemy
had
landed
we
may
be
sure
that
he
would
have
been
heroically
opposed
but
history
shows
us
so
many
examples
of
the
superiority
of
veteran
troops
over
new
levies
however
numerous
and
brave
that
without
disparaging
our
countrymen
soldierly
merits
we
may
well
be
thankful
that
no
trial
of
them
was
then
made
on
english
land
especially
must
we
feel
this
when
we
contrast
the
high
military
genius
of
the
prince
of
parma
who

not
to
attack

in
the
first
instance
but
first
to
effect
a
landing
and
secure
a
strong
position
in
ireland
his
admiral
santa
cruz
had
recommended
him
to
make
sure
in
the
first
instance
of
some
large
harbour
on
the
coast
of
holland
or
zealand
where
the
armada
having
entered
the
channel
might
find
shelter
in
case
of
storm
and
whence
it
could
sail
without
difficulty
for
england
but
philip
rejected
both
these
counsels
and
directed
that
england
itself
should
be
made
the
immediate
object
of
attack
and
on
the
of
may
the
armada
left
the
tagus
in
the
pomp
and
pride
of
supposed
invincibility
and
amidst
the
shouts
of
thousands
who
believed
that
england
was
already
conquered
but
steering
to
the
northward
and
before
it
was
clear
of
the
coast
of
spain
the
armada
was
assailed
by
a
violent
storm
and
driven
back
with
considerable
damage
to
the
ports
of
biscay
and
galicia
it
had
however
sustained
its
heaviest
loss
before
it
left
the
tagus
in
the
death
of
the
veteran
admiral
santa
cruz
who
had
been
destined
to
guide
it
against
england
this
experienced
sailor
notwithstanding
his
diligence
and
success
had
been
unable
to
keep
pace
with
the
impatient
ardour
of
his
master
philip
ii
had
reproached
him
with
his
dilatoriness
and
had
said
with
ungrateful
harshness
you
make
an
ill
return
for
all
my
kindness
to
you
these
words
cut
the
veteran
heart
and
proved
fatal
to
santa
cruz
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
and
grief
he
sickened
and
died
philip

had
replaced
him
by
alonzo
perez

duke
of
medina
sidonia
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
spanish
grandees
but
wholly
unqualified
to
command

an
expedition

had
however
as
his
lieutenants

men
of
proved
skill
and
bravery

and
miguel

of

the
report
of
the
storm
which
had
beaten
back
the
armada
reached
england
with
much
exaggeration
and
it
was
supposed
by
some
of
the
counsellors
that
the
invasion
would
now
be
deferred
to
another
year
but
lord
howard
of
effingham
the
lord
of
the
english
fleet
judged
more
wisely
that
the
danger
was
not
yet
passed
and
as
already
mentioned
had
the
moral
courage
to
refuse
to
dismantle
his
principal
ships
though
he
received
orders
to
that
effect
but
it
was
not
design
to
keep
the
english
fleet
in
costly
inaction
and
to
wait
patiently
in
our
own
harbours
till
the
spaniards
had
recruited
their
strength
and
sailed
forth
again
to
attack
us
the
english
seamen
of
that
age
like
their
successors
loved
to
strike
better
than
to
parry
though
when
emergency
required
they
could
be
patient
and
cautious
in
their
bravery
it
was
resolved
to
proceed
to
spain
to
learn
the
real
condition
and
to
deal
him
any
blow
for
which
there
might
be
opportunity
in
this
bold
policy
we
may
well
believe
him
to
have
been
eagerly
seconded
by
those
who
commanded
under
him
howard
and
drake
sailed
accordingly
to
corunna
hoping
to
surprise
and
attack
some
part
of
the
armada
in
that
harbour
but
when
near
the
coast
of
spain
the
north
wind
which
had
blown
up
to
that
time
veered
suddenly
to
the
south
and
fearing
that
the
spaniards
might
put
to
sea
and
pass
him
unobserved
howard
returned
to
the
entrance
of
the
channel
where
he
cruised
for
some
time
on
the
for
the
enemy
in
part
of
a
letter
written
by
him
at
this
period
he
speaks
of
the
difficulty
of
guarding
so
large
a
breadth
of
sea
a
difficulty
that
ought
not
to
be
forgotten
when
modern
schemes
of
defence
against
hostile
fleets
from
the
south
are
discussed
i
myself
he
wrote
do
lie
in
the
midst
of
the
channel
with
the
greatest
force
sir
francis
drake
hath
twenty
ships
and
four
or
five
pinnaces
which
lie
towards
ushant
and
hawkins
with
as
many
more
lieth
towards
scilly
thus
we
are
fain
to
do
or
else
with
this
wind
they
might
pass
us
by
and
we
never
the
wiser
the
sleeve
is
another
manner
of
thing
than
it
was
taken
for
we
find
it
by
experience
and
daily
observation
to
be
miles
over
a
large
room
for
me
to
look
unto
but
after
some
time
further
reports
that
the
spaniards
were
inactive
in
their
harbour
where
they
were
suffering
severely
from
sickness
caused
howard
also
to
relax
in
his
vigilance
and
he
returned
to
plymouth
with
the
greater
part
of
his
fleet
on
the
of
july
the
armada
having
completely
refitted
sailed
again
for
the
channel
and
reached
it
without
obstruction
or
observation
by
the
english
the
design
of
the
spaniards
was
that
the
armada
should
give
them
at
least
for
a
time
the
command
of
the
sea
and
that
it
should
join
the
squadron
which
parma
had
collected
off
calais
then
escorted
by
an
overpowering
naval
force
parma
and
his
army
were
to
embark
in
their
flotilla
and
cross
the
sea
to
england
where
they
were
to
be
landed
together
with
the
troops
which
the
armada
brought
from
the
ports
of
spain
the
scheme
was
not
dissimilar
to
one
formed
against
england
a
little
more
than
two
centuries
afterwards
as
napoleon
in
waited
with
his
army
and
flotilla
at
boulogne
looking
for
villeneuve
to
drive
away
the
english
cruisers
and
secure
him
a
passage
across
the
channel
so
parma
in
waited
for

to
drive
away
the
dutch
and
english
squadrons
that
watched
his
flotilla
and
to
enable
his
veterans
to
cross
the
sea
to
the
land
that
they
were
to
conquer
thanks
to
providence
in
each
case
england
enemy
waited
in
vain
although
the
numbers
of
sail
which
the
queen
government
and
the
patriotic
zeal
of
volunteers
had
collected
for
the
defence
of
england
exceeded
the
number
of
sail
in
the
spanish
fleet
the
english
ships
were
collectively
far
inferior
in
size
to
their
adversaries
their
aggregate
tonnage
being
less
by
half
than
that
of
the
enemy
in
the
number
of
guns
and
weight
of
metal
the
disproportion
was
still
greater
the
english
admiral
was
also
obliged
to
subdivide
his
force
and
lord
henry
seymour
with
forty
of
the
best
dutch
and
english
ships
was
employed
in
blockading
the
hostile
ports
in
flanders
and
in
preventing
the
prince
of
parma
from
coming
out
of
dunkirk
the
orders
of
king
philip
to
the
duke
de
medina
sidonia
were
that
he
should
on
entering
the
channel
keep
near
the
french
coast
and
if
attacked
by
the
english
ships
avoid
an
action
and
steer
on
to
calais
roads
where
the
prince
of
parma
squadron
was
to
join
him
the
hope
of
surprising
and
destroying
the
english
fleet
in
plymouth
led
the
spanish
admiral
to
deviate
from
these
orders
and
to
stand
across
to
the
english
shore
but
on
finding
that
lord
howard
was
coming
out
to
meet
him
he
resumed
the
original
plan
and
determined
to
bend
his
way
steadily
towards
calais
and
dunkirk
and
to
keep
merely
on
the
defensive
against
such
squadrons
of
the
english
as
might
come
up
with
him
it
was
on
saturday
the
of
july
that
lord
effingham
came
in
sight
of
his
formidable
adversaries
the
armada
was
drawn
up
in
form
of
a
crescent
which
from
horn
to
horn
measured
some
seven
miles
there
was
a
wind
and
before
it
the
vast
vessels
sailed
slowly
on
the
english
let
them
pass
by
and
then
following
in
the
rear
commenced
an
attack
on
them
a
running
fight
now
took
place
in
which
some
of
the
best
ships
of
the
spaniards
were
captured
many
more
received
heavy
damage
while
the
english
vessels
which
took
care
not
to
close
with
their
huge
antagonists
but
availed
themselves
of
their
superior
celerity
in
tacking
and
manoeuvring
suffered
little
comparative
loss
each
day
added
not
only
to
the
spirit
but
to
the
number
of
force
raleigh
oxford
cumberland
and
sheffield
joined
him
and
the
gentlemen
of
england
hired
ships
from
all
parts
at
their
own
charge
and
with
one
accord
came
flocking
thither
as
to
a
set
field
where
glory
was
to
be
attained
and
faithful
service
performed
unto
their
prince
and
their
country
raleigh
justly
praises
the
english
admiral
for
his
skilful
tactics
he
says
historie
of
the
world
p
certainly
he
that
will
happily
perform
a
fight
at
sea
must
be
skillful
in
making
choice
of
vessels
to
fight
in
he
must
believe
that
there
is
more
belonging
to
a
good
upon
the
waters
than
great
daring
and
must
know
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
fighting
loose
or
at
large
and
grappling
the
guns
of
a
slow
ship
pierce
as
well
and
make
as
great
holes
as
those
in
a
swift
to
clap
ships
together
without
consideration
belongs
rather
to
a
madman
than
to
a
man
of
war
for
by
such
an
ignorant
bravery
was
peter
strossie
lost
at
the
azores
when
he
fought
against
the
marquis
of
santa
cruza
in
like
sort
had
the
lord
charles
howard
admiral
of
england
been
lost
in
the
year
if
he
had
not
been
better
advised
than
a
great
many
malignant
fools
were
that
found
fault
with
his
demeanour
the
spaniards
had
an
army
aboard
them
and
he
had
none
they
had
more
ships
than
he
had
and
of
higher
building
and
charging
so
that
had
he
entangled
himself
with
those
great
and
powerful
vessels
he
had
greatly
endangered
this
kingdom
of
england
for
twenty
men
upon
the
defences
are
equal
to
a
hundred
that
board
and
enter
whereas
then
contrariwise
the
spaniards
had
a
hundred
for
twenty
of
ours
to
defend
themselves
withall
but
our
admiral
knew
his
advantage
and
held
it
which
had
he
not
done
he
had
not
been
worthy
to
have
held
his
head
the
spanish
admiral
also
showed
great
judgment
and
firmness
in
following
the
line
of
conduct
that
had
been
traced
out
for
him
and
on
the
of
july
he
brought
his
fleet
unbroken
though
sorely
distressed
to
anchor
in
calais
roads
but
the
king
of
spain
had
calculated
ill
the
number
and
activity
of
the
english
and
dutch
fleets
as
the
old
historian
expresses
it
it
seemeth
that
the
duke
of
parma
and
the
spaniards
grounded
upon
a
vain
and
presumptuous
expectation
that
all
the
ships
of
england
and
of
the
low
countreys
would
at
the
first
sight
of
the
spanish
and
dunkerk
navie
have
betaken
themselves
to
flight
yeelding
them
and
endeavouring
only
to
defend
themselves
their
havens
and
from
invasion
wherefore
their
intent
and
purpose
was
that
the
duke
of
parma
in
his
small
and
ships
should
as
it
were
under
the
shadow
and
wing
of
the
spanish
fleet
convey
over
all
his
troupes
armour
and
warlike
provisions
and
with
their
forces
so
united
should
invade
england
or
while
the
english
fleet
were
busied
in
fight
against
the
spanish
should
enter
upon
any
part
of
the
coast
which
he
thought
to
be
most
convenient
which
invasion
as
the
captives
afterwards
confessed
the
duke
of
parma
thought
first
to
have
attempted
by
the
river
of
thames
upon
the
banks
whereof
having
at
the
first
arrivall
landed
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
of
his
principall
souldiers
he
supposed
that
he
might
easily
have
wonne
the
citie
of
london
both
because
his
small
shippes
should
have
followed
and
assisted
his
and
also
for
that
the
citie
itselfe
was
but
meanely
fortified
and
easie
to
overcome
by
reason
of
the
citizens
delicacie
and
discontinuance
from
the
warres
who
with
continuall
and
constant
labour
might
be
vanquished
if
they
yielded
not
at
the
first
assault
hakluyt
voyages
vol
i
but
the
english
and
dutch
found
ships
and
mariners
enough
to
keep
the
armada
itself
in
check
and
at
the
same
time
to
block
up
flotilla
the
greater
part
of
seymour
squadron
left
its
cruising
ground
off
dunkirk
to
join
the
english
admiral
off
calais
but
the
dutch
manned
about
sail
of
good
ships
with
a
strong
force
of
soldiers
on
board
all
well
seasoned
to
the
and
with
these
they
blockaded
the
flemish
ports
that
were
in
parma
power
still
it
was
resolved
by
the
spanish
admiral
and
the
prince
to
endeavour
to
effect
a
junction
which
the
english
seamen
were
equally
resolute
to
prevent
and
bolder
measures
on
our
side
now
became
necessary
the
armada
lay
off
calais
with
its
largest
ships
ranged
outside
like
strong
castles
fearing
no
assault
the
lesser
placed
in
the
middle
ward
the
english
admiral
could
not
attack
them
in
their
position
without
great
disadvantage
but
on
the
night
of
the
he
sent
eight
among
them
with
almost
equal
effect
to
that
of
the
which
the
greeks
so
often
employed
against
the
turkish
fleets
in
their
late
war
of
independence
the
spaniards
cut
their
cables
and
put
to
sea
in
confusion
one
of
the
largest
galeasses
ran
foul
of
another
vessel
and
was
stranded
the
rest
of
the
fleet
was
scattered
about
on
the
flemish
coast
and
when
the
morning
broke
it
was
with
difficulty
and
delay
that
they
obeyed
their
admiral
signal
to
range
themselves
round
him
near
gravelines
now
was
the
golden
opportunity
for
the
english
to
assail
them
and
prevent
them
from
ever
letting
loose
parma
flotilla
against
england
and
nobly
was
that
opportunity
used
drake
and
fenner
were
the
first
english
captains
who
attacked
the
unwieldy
leviathans
then
came
fenton
southwell
burton
cross
raynor
and
then
the
lord
admiral
with
lord
thomas
howard
and
lord
sheffield
the
spaniards
only
thought
of
forming
and
keeping
close
together
and
were
driven
by
the
english
past
dunkirk
and
far
away
from
the
prince
of
parma
who
in
watching
their
defeat
from
the
coast
must
as
drake
expressed
it
have
chafed
like
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
this
was
indeed
the
last
and
the
decisive
battle
between
the
two
fleets
it
is
perhaps
best
described
in
the
very
words
of
the
contemporary
writer
as
we
may
read
them
in
hakluyt
vol
p
upon
the
of
july
in
the
morning
the
spanish
fleet
after
the
forsayd
tumult
having
arranged
themselves
againe
into
order
were
within
sight
of
greveling
most
bravely
and
furiously
encountered
by
the
english
where
they
once
again
got
the
wind
of
the
spaniards
who
suffered
themselves
to
be
deprived
of
the
commodity
of
the
place
in
calais
road
and
of
the
advantage
of
the
wind
neer
unto
dunkerk
rather
than
they
would
change
their
array
or
separate
their
forces
now
conjoyned
and
united
together
standing
only
upon
their
defence
and
howbeit
there
were
many
excellent
and
warlike
ships
in
the
english
fleet
yet
scarce
were
there
or
among
them
all
which
matched
of
the
spanish
ships
in
the
bigness
or
could
conveniently
assault
them
wherefore
the
english
ships
using
their
prerogative
of
nimble
steerage
whereby
they
could
turn
and
wield
themselves
with
the
wind
which
way
they
listed
came
often
times
very
near
upon
the
spaniards
and
charged
them
so
sore
that
now
and
then
they
were
but
a
pike
length
asunder
and
so
continually
giving
them
one
broadside
after
another
they
discharged
all
their
shot
both
great
and
small
upon
them
spending
one
whole
day
from
morning
till
night
in
that
violent
kind
of
conflict
untill
such
time
as
powder
and
bullets
failed
them
in
regard
of
which
want
they
thought
it
convenient
not
to
pursue
the
spaniards
any
longer
because
they
had
many
great
vantages
of
the
english
namely
for
the
extraordinary
bigness
of
their
ships
and
also
for
that
they
were
so
neerley
conjoyned
and
kept
together
in
so
good
array
that
they
could
by
no
meanes
be
fought
withall
one
to
one
the
english
thought
therefore
that
they
had
right
well
acquitted
themselves
in
chasing
the
spaniards
first
from
caleis
and
then
from
dunkerk
and
by
that
meanes
to
have
hindered
them
from
joyning
with
the
duke
of
parma
his
forces
and
getting
the
wind
of
them
to
have
driven
them
from
their
own
coasts
the
spaniards
that
day
sustained
great
loss
and
damage
having
many
of
their
shippes
shot
thorow
and
thorow
and
they
discharged
likewise
great
store
of
ordinance
against
the
english
who
indeed
sustained
some
hindrance
but
not
comparable
to
the
spaniard
loss
for
they
lost
not
any
one
ship
or
person
of
account
for
very
diligent
inquisition
being
made
the
english
men
all
that
time
wherein
the
spanish
navy
sayled
upon
their
seas
are
not
found
to
have
wanted
aboue
one
hundred
of
their
people
albeit
sir
francis
drake
ship
was
pierced
with
shot
above
forty
times
and
his
very
cabben
was
twice
shot
thorow
and
about
the
conclusion
of
the
fight
the
bed
of
a
certaine
gentleman
lying
weary
thereupon
was
taken
quite
from
under
him
with
the
force
of
a
bullet
likewise
as
the
earle
of
northumberland
and
sir
charles
blunt
were
at
dinner
upon
a
time
the
bullet
of
a
brake
thorow
the
middest
of
their
cabben
touched
their
feet
and
strooke
downe
two
of
the
standers
by
with
many
such
accidents
befalling
the
english
shippes
which
it
were
tedious
to
rehearse
it
reflects
little
credit
on
the
english
government
that
the
english
fleet
was
so
deficiently
supplied
with
ammunition
as
to
be
unable
to
complete
the
destruction
of
the
invaders
but
enough
was
done
to
ensure
it
many
of
the
largest
spanish
ships
were
sunk
or
captured
in
the
action
of
this
day
and
at
length
the
spanish
admiral
despairing
of
success
fled
northward
with
a
southerly
wind
in
the
hope
of
rounding
scotland
and
so
returning
to
spain
without
a
farther
encounter
with
the
english
fleet
lord
effingham
left
a
squadron
to
continue
the
blockade
of
the
prince
of
parma
armament
but
that
wise
general
soon
withdrew
his
troops
to
more
promising
fields
of
action
meanwhile
the
himself
and
drake
chased
the
vincible
armada
as
it
was
now
termed
for
some
distance
northward
and
then
when
it
seemed
to
bend
away
from
the
scotch
coast
towards
norway
it
was
thought
best
in
the
words
of
drake
to
leave
them
to
those
boisterous
and
uncouth
northern
seas
the
sufferings
and
losses
which
the
unhappy
spaniards
sustained
in
their
flight
round
scotland
and
ireland
are
well
known
of
their
whole
armada
only
shattered
vessels
brought
back
their
beaten
and
wasted
crews
to
the
spanish
coast
which
they
had
quitted
in
such
pageantry
and
pride
some
passages
from
the
writings
of
those
who
took
part
in
the
struggle
have
been
already
quoted
and
the
most
spirited
description
of
the
defeat
of
the
armada
which
ever
was
penned
may
perhaps
be
taken
from
the
letter
which
our
brave
drake
wrote
in
answer
to
some
mendacious
stories
by
which
the
spaniards
strove
to
hide
their
shame
thus
does
he
describe
the
scenes
in
which
he
played
so
important
a
part
see
strypo
and
the
notes
to
the
life
of
drake
in
the
biographia
britannica
they
were
not
ashamed
to
publish
in
sundry
languages
in
print
great
victories
in
words
which
they
pretended
to
have
obtained
against
this
realm
and
spread
the
same
in
a
most
false
sort
over
all
parts
of
france
italy
and
elsewhere
when
shortly
afterwards
it
was
happily
manifested
in
very
deed
to
all
nations
how
their
navy
which
they
termed
invincible
consisting
of
one
hundred
and
forty
sail
of
ships
not
only
of
their
own
kingdom

and
shuffled
together

from

shamefully
left

his
mighty
ship
from

to
calais

they
lost

de
moncado
with
the
galleys
of
which
he
was
captain
and
from
calais
driven
with
squibs
from
their
anchors
were
chased
out
of
the
sight
of
england
round
about
scotland
and
ireland
where
for
the
sympathy
of
their
religion
hoping
to
find
succour
and
assistance
a
great
part
of
them
were
crushed
against
the
rocks
and
those
others
that
landed

very
many
in
number
were
notwithstanding
broken
slain
and
taken
and
so
sent
from

majesty
of
her
princely
and
invincible
disposition
disdaining
to
put
them
to
death
and
scorning
either
to
retain
or
to
entertain
them
they
were
all
sent
back
again
to
their

the
power
which

acquired
and
was
acquiring
at
the
commencement
of

was
almost
equally
menacing

if
tested
by
the
amount
of
permanent
aggrandisement
which
each
procured
for

the
ambition
of

was
more
successful
than
were
the
enterprises

conquered
were
rent
again
from

devastating

but
she
still
possesses

and

she
has
still
the
extended
boundaries
which
louis
xiv
gave
her
and
the
royal
spanish
marriages
a
few
years
ago
proved
clearly
how
enduring
has
been
the
political
influence
which
the
arts
and
arms
of
france
grand
monarque
obtained
for
her
southward
of
the
pyrenees
when
louis
xiv
took
the
reins
of
government
into
his
own
hands
after
the
death
of
cardinal
mazarin
there
was
a
union
of
ability
with
opportunity
such
as
france
had
not
seen
since
the
days
of
charlemagne
moreover
louis
career
was
no
brief
one
for
upwards
of
forty
years
for
a
period
nearly
equal
to
the
duration
of
charlemagne
reign
louis
steadily
followed
an
aggressive
and
a
generally
successful
policy
he
passed
a
long
youth
and
manhood
of
triumph
before
the
military
genius
of
marlborough
made
him
acquainted
with
humiliation
and
defeat
the
great
bourbon
lived
too
long
he
should
not
have
outstayed
our
two
english
kings
one
his
dependent
james
the
other
his
antagonist
william

had
he
died
in
the
year
within
which
they
died
his
reign
would
be
cited
as
unequalled
in
the
french
annals
for
its
prosperity
but
he
lived
on
to
see
his
armies
beaten
his
cities
captured
and
his
kingdom
wasted
by
disastrous
war
it
is
as
if
charlemagne
had
survived
to
be
defeated
by
the
northmen
and
to
witness
the
misery
and
shame
that
actually
fell
to
the
lot
of
his
descendants
still
louis
xiv
had
forty
years
of
success
and
from
the
permanence
of
their
fruits
we
may
judge
what
the
results
would
have
been
if
the
last
fifteen
years
of
his
reign
had
been
equally
fortunate
had
it
not
been
for
blenheim
all
europe
might
at
this
day
suffer
under
the
effect
of
french
conquests
resembling
those
of
alexander
in
extent
and
those
of
the
romans
in
durability
when
louis
xiv
began
to
govern
he
found
all
the
materials
for
a
strong
government
ready
to
his
hand
richelieu
had
completely
tamed
the
turbulent
spirit
of
the
french
nobility
and
had
subverted
the
imperium
in
imperio
of
the
huguenots
the
faction
of
the
frondeurs
in
time
had
had
the
effect
of
making
the
parisian
parliament
utterly
hateful
and
contemptible
in
the
eyes
of
the
nation
the
assemblies
of
the
were
obsolete
the
royal
authority
alone
remained
the
king
was
the
state
louis
knew
his
position
he
fearlessly
avowed
it
and
he
fearlessly
acted
up
to
it

p
not
only
was
his

a
strong
one
but
the
country
which
he
governed
was
strong
strong
in
its
geographical
situation
in
the
compactness
of
its
territory
in
the
number
and
martial
spirit
of
its
inhabitants
and
in
their
complete
and
undivided
nationality
louis
had
neither
a
hungary
nor
an
ireland
in
his
dominions
and
it
was
not
till
late
in
his
reign
when
old
age
had
made
his
bigotry
more
gloomy
and
had
given
fanaticism
the
mastery
over
prudence
that
his
persecuting
intolerance
caused
the
civil
war
in
the
cevennes
like
napoleon
in
louis
xiv
saw
clearly
that
the
great
wants
of
france
were
ships
colonies
and
commerce
but
louis
did
more
than
see
these
wants
by
the
aid
of
his
great
minister
colbert
he
supplied
them
one
of
the
surest
proofs
of
the
genius
of
louis
was
his
skill
in
finding
out
genius
in
others
and
his
promptness
in
calling
it
into
action
under
him
louvois
organized

villars
and
berwick
led
the
armies
of

and
vauban
fortified

frontiers
throughout

french
diplomacy
was
marked
by
skilfulness
and
activity
and
also
by
comprehensive
such
as
the
representatives
of
no
other
nation
possessed
guizot
testimony
to
the
vigour
that
was
displayed
through
every
branch
of
louis
xiv
government
and
to
the
extent
to
which
france
at
present
is
indebted
to
him
is
remarkable
he
says
that
taking
the
public
services
of
every
kind
the
finances
the
departments
of
roads
and
public
works
the
military
administration
and
all
the
establishments
which
belong
to
every
branch
of
administration
there
is
not
one
that
will
not
be
found
to
have
had
its
origin
its
development
or
its
greatest
perfection
under
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
history
of
european
civilization
lecture
and
he
points
out
to
us
that
the
government
of
louis
xiv
was
the
first
that
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
europe
as
a
power
acting
upon
sure
grounds
which
had
not
to
dispute
its
existence
with
inward
enemies
but
was
at
ease
as
to
its
territory
and
its
people
and
solely
occupied
with
the
task
of
administering
government
properly
so
called
all
the
european
governments
had
been
previously
thrown
into
incessant
wars
which
deprived
them
of
all
security
as
well
as
of
all
leisure
or
so
harassed
by
internal
parties
or
antagonists
that
their
time
was
passed
in
fighting
for
existence
the
government
of
louis
xiv
was
the
first
to
appear
as
a
busy
thriving
administration
of
affairs
as
a
power
at
once
definitive
and
progressive
which
was
not
afraid
to
innovate
because
it
could
reckon
securely
on
the
future
there
have
been
in
fact
very
few
governments
equally
innovating
compare
it
with
a
government
of
the
same
nature
the
unmixed
monarchy
of
philip
ii
in
spain
it
was
more
absolute
than
that
of
louis
and
yet
it
was
far
less
regular
and
tranquil
how
did
philip
ii
succeed
in
establishing
absolute
power
in
spain
by
stifling
all
activity
in
the
country
opposing
himself
to
every
species
of
amelioration
and
rendering
the
state
of
spain
completely
stagnant
the
government
of
louis
on
the
contrary
exhibited
alacrity
for
all
sorts
of
innovations
and
showed
itself
favourable
to
the
progress
of
letters
arts
wealth
in
short
of
civilization
this
was
the
veritable
cause
of
its
preponderance
in
europe
which
arose
to
such
a
pitch
that
it
became
the
type
of
a
government
not
only
to
sovereigns
but
also
to
nations
during
the
seventeenth
century
while
france
was
thus
strong
and
united
in
herself
and
ruled
by
a
martial
an
ambitious
and
with
all
his
faults
an
enlightened
and
sovereign
what
european
power
was
there
fit
to
cope
with
her
or
keep
her
in
check
as
to
germany
the
ambitious
projects
of
the
german
branch
of
austria
had
been
entirely
defeated
the
peace
of
the
empire
had
been
restored
and
almost
a
new
constitution
formed
or
an
old
revived
by
the
treaties
of
westphalia
nay
the
imperial
eagle
was
not
only
fallen
but
her
wings
were
clipped
bolingbroke
vol
ii
lord
letters
on
the
use
of
history
and
his
sketch
of
the
history
and
state
of
europe
abound
with
remarks
on
louis
xiv
and
his
contemporaries
of
which
the
substance
is
as
sound
as
the
style
is
beautiful
unfortunately
like
all
his
other
works
they
contain
also
a
large
proportion
of
sophistry
and
misrepresentation
the
best
test
to
use
before
we
adopt
any
opinion
or
assertion
of
bolingbroke
is
to
consider
whether
in
writing
it
he
was
thinking
either
of
sir
robert
walpole
or
of
revealed
religion
when
either
of
these
objects
of
his
hatred
was
before
his
mind
he
scrupled
at
no
artifice
or
exaggeration
that
might
serve
the
purpose
of
his
malignity
on
most
other
occasions
he
may
be
followed
with
advantage
as
he
always
may
be
read
with
pleasure
as
to
spain
the
spanish
branch
of
the
austrian
house
had
sunk
equally
low
philip
ii
left
his
successors
a
ruined
monarchy
he
left
them
something
worse
he
left
them
his
example
and
his
principles
of
government
founded
in
ambition
in
pride
in
ignorance
in
bigotry
and
all
the
pedantry
of
state
bolingbroke
vol
ii
p
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
that
france
in
the
first
war
of
louis
despised
the
opposition
of
both
branches
of
the
once
predominant
house
of
austria
indeed
in
germany
the
french
king
acquired
allies
among
the
princes
of
the
empire
against
the
emperor
himself
he
had
a
still
stronger
support
in
austria
misgovernment
of
her
own
subjects
the
words
of
bolingbroke
on
this
are
remarkable
and
some
of
them
sound
as
if
written
within
the
last
three
years
bolingbroke
says
it
was
not
merely
the
want
of
cordial
among
the
princes
of
the
empire
that
disabled
the
emperor
from
acting
with
vigour
in
the
cause
of
his
family
then
nor
that
has
rendered
the
house
of
austria
a
dead
weight
upon
all
her
allies
ever
since
bigotry
and
its
inseparable
companion
cruelty
as
well
as
the
tyranny
and
avarice
of
the
court
of
vienna
created
in
those
days
and
has
maintained
in
ours
almost
a
perpetual
diversion
of
the
imperial
arms
from
all
effectual
opposition
to
france
i
mean
to
speak
of
the
troubles
in
hungary
whatever
they
became
in
their
progress
they
were
caused
originally
by
the
userpations
and
persecutions
of
the
emperor
and
when
the
hungarians
were
called
rebels
first
they
were
called
so
for
no
other
reason
than
this
that
they
would
not
be
slaves
the
dominion
of
the
emperor
being
less
supportable
than
that
of
the
turks
this
unhappy
people
opened
a
door
to
the
latter
to
infest
the
empire
instead
of
making
their
country
what
it
had
been
before
a
barrier
against
the
ottoman
power
france
became
a
sure
though
secret
ally
of
the
turks
as
well
as
the
hungarians
and
has
found
her
account
in
it
by
keeping
the
emperor
in
perpetual
alarms
on
that
side
while
she
has
ravaged
the
empire
and
the
low
countries
on
the
other
bolingbroke
vol
ii
p
if
after
having
seen
the
imbecility
of
germany
and
spain
against
the
france
of
louis
we
turn
to
the
two
only
remaining
european
powers
of
any
importance
at
that
time
to
england
and
to
holland
we
find
the
position
of
our
own
country
as
to
european
politics
from
to
most
painful
to
contemplate
from
to
england
by
the
return
of

reduced
to
a
nullity
the
words
are
michelet

and
though
severe
they
are
just
they
are
in
fact
not
severe
enough
for
when
england
under
her
restored
dynasty
of
the
stuarts
did
take
any
part
in
european
politics
her
conduct
or
rather
her
king

was
almost
invariably
wicked
and
dishonourable
bolingbroke
rightly
says
that
previous
to
the
revolution
of
during
the
whole
progress
that
louis
xiv
made
in
obtaining
such
exorbitant
power
as
gave
him
hopes
of
acquiring
at
last
to
his
family
the
spanish
monarchy
england
had
been
either
an
idle
spectator
of
what
passed
on
the
continent
or
a
faint
and
uncertain
ally
against
france
or
a
warm
and
sure
ally
on
her
side
or
a
partial
mediator
between
her
and
the
powers
confederated
together
in
their
common
defence
but
though
the
court
of
england
submitted
to
abet
the
usurpations
of
france

stooped
to
be
her
pensioner

crime
was
not
national

out
loudly
against

resistance

both
by

and

how
he
took

of
augsburg
was
formed
against

the

of

of

to

in
gave
a
new
spirit
to
the
opposition
which
france
encountered
of
the
long
and
chequered
war
that
followed
in
which
the
french
armies
were
generally
victorious
on
the
continent
though
his
fleet
was
beaten
at
la
hogue
and
his
dependent
james
ii
was
defeated
at
the
boyne
or
of
the
treaty
of
ryswick
which
left
france
in
possession
of
roussillon
artois
and
strasburg
which
gave
europe
no
security
against
her
claims
on
the
spanish
succession
and
which
louis
regarded
as
a
mere
truce
to
gain
before
a
more
decisive
struggle
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
ambition
of
louis
in
these
wars
was
twofold
it
had
its
immediate
and
its
ulterior
objects
its
immediate
object
was
to
conquer
and
annex
to
france
the
neighbouring
provinces
and
towns
that
were
most
convenient
for
the
increase
of
her
strength
but
the
ulterior
object
of
louis
from
the
time
of
his
marriage
to
the
spanish
infanta
in
was
to
acquire
for
the
house
of
bourbon
the
whole
empire
of
spain
a
formal
renunciation
of
all
right
to
the
spanish
succession
had
been
made
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
but
such
renunciations
were
never
of
any
practical
effect
and
many
casuists
and
jurists
of
the
age
even
held
them
to
be
intrinsically
void
as
time
passed
on
and
the
prospect
of
charles
ii
of
spain
dying
without
lineal
heirs
became
more
and
more
certain
so
did
the
claims
of
the
house
of
bourbon
to
the
spanish
crown
after
his
death
become
matters
of
urgent
interest
to
french
ambition
on
the
one
hand
and
to
the
other
powers
of
europe
on
the
other
at
length
the
unhappy
king
of
spain
died
by
his
will
he
appointed
philip
duke
of
anjou
one
of
louis
xiv
grandsons
to
succeed
him
on
the
throne
of
spain
and
strictly
forbade
any
partition
of
his
dominions
louis
well
knew
that
a
general
european
war
would
follow
if
he
accepted
for
his
house
the
crown
thus
bequeathed
but
he
had
been
preparing
for
this
crisis
throughout
his
reign
he
sent
his
grandson
into
spain
as
king
philip
of
that
country
addressing
to
him
on
his
departure
the
memorable
words
there
are
no
longer
any
pyrenees
the
empire
which
now
received
the
grandson
of
louis
as
its
king
comprised
besides
spain
itself
the
strongest
part
of
the
netherlands
sardinia
sicily
naples
the
principality
of
milan
and
other
possessions
in
italy
the
philippines
and
marilla
islands
in
asia
and
in
the
new
world
besides
california
and
florida
the
greatest
part
of
central
and
of
southern
america
philip
was
well
received
in
madrid
where
he
was
crowned
as
king
philip
in
the
beginning
of
the
distant
portions
of
his
empire
sent
in
their
adhesion
and
the
house
of
bourbon
either
by
its
french
or
spanish
troops
now
had
occupation
both
of
the
kingdom
of
francis
and
of
the
fairest
and
amplest
portion
of
the
empire
of
the
great
rival
of
francis
charles
loud
was
the
wrath
of
austria
whose
princes
were
the
rival
claimants
of
the
bourbons
for
the
empire
of
spain
the
indignation
of
william
though
not
equally
loud
was
far
more
deep
and
energetic
by
his
exertions
a
league
against
the
house
of
bourbon
was
formed
between
england
holland
and
the
austrian
emperor
which
was
subsequently
joined
by
the
kings
of
portugal
and
prussia
by
the
duke
of
savoy
and
by
denmark
indeed
the
alarm
throughout
europe
was
now
general
and
urgent
it
was
clear
that
louis
aimed
a
consolidating
france
and
the
spanish
dominions
into
one
preponderating
empire
at
the
moment
when
philip
was
departing
to
take
possession
of
spain
louis
had
issued
in
his
favour
to
the
effect
of
preserving
his
rights
to
the
throne
of
france
and
louis
had
himself
obtained
possession
of
the
important
frontier
of
the
spanish
netherlands
with
its
numerous
fortified
cities
which
were
given
up
to
his
troops
under
pretence
of
securing
them
for
the
young
king
of
spain
whether
the
formal
union
of
the
two
crowns
was
likely
to
take
place
speedily
or
not
it
was
evident
that
the
resources
of
the
whole
spanish
monarchy
were
now
virtually
at
the
french
king
disposal
the
peril
that
seemed
to
menace
the
empire
england
holland
and
the
other
independent
powers
is
well
summed
up
by
alison
spain

threatened
the
liberties
of

in
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
france

all
but
overthrown

close
of

seventeenth

military
history
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
p
our
knowledge
of
the
decayed
state
into
which
the
spanish
power
had
fallen
ought
not
to
make
us
regard
their
alarms
as
chimerical
spain
possessed
enormous
resources
and
her
strength
was
capable
of
being
regenerated
by
a
vigorous
ruler
we
should
remember
what
alberoni
effected
even
after
the
close
of
the
war
of
succession
by
what
that
minister
did
in
a
few
years
we
may
judge
what
louis
xiv
would
have
done
in
restoring
the
maritime
and
military
power
of
that
great
country
which
nature
has
so
largely
gifted
and
which
man
misgovernment
has
so
debased
the
death
of
king
william
on
the
of
march
at
first
seemed
likely
to
paralyse
the
league
against
france
for
notwithstanding
the
with
which
he
made
war
generally
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
sole
centre
of
union
that
could
keep
together
the
great
confederacy
then
forming
and
how
much
the
french
feared
from
his
life
had
appeared
a
few
years
before
in
the
extravagant
and
indecent
joy
they
expressed
on
a
false
report
of
his
death
a
short
time
showed
how
vain
the
fears
of
some
and
the
hopes
of
others
were
bolingbroke
vol

p
queen
anne
within
three
days
after
her
accession
went
down
to
the
house
of
lords
and
there
declared
her
resolution
to
support
the
measures
planned
by
her
predecessor
who
had
been
the
great
support
not
only
of
these
kingdoms
but
of
all
europe
anne
was
married
to
prince
george
of
denmark
and
by
her
accession
to
the
english
throne
the
confederacy
against
louis
obtained
the
aid
of
the
troops
of
denmark
but
anne
strong
attachment
to
one
of
her
female
friends
led
to
far
more
important
advantages
to

the
cause
of
this
military
glory

and
too
often
does
dazzle
both
contemporaries
and
posterity
until
the
crimes
as
well
as
the
vices
of
heroes
are
forgotten
but
even
a
few
stains
of
personal
meanness
will
dim
a
soldier
reputation
irreparably
and
marlborough
faults
were
of
a
peculiarly
base
and
mean
order
our
feelings
towards
historical
personages
are
in
this
respect
like
our
feelings
towards
private
acquaintances
there
are
actions
of
that
shabby
nature
that
however
much
they
may
be
outweighed
by
a
man
good
deeds
on
a
general
estimate
of
his
character
we
never
can
feel
any
cordial
liking
for
the
person
who
has
been
guilty
of
them
thus
with
respect
to
the
duke
of
marlborough
it
goes
against
our
feelings
to
admire
the
man
who
owed
his
first
advancement
in
life
to
the
which
he
and
his
family
acquired
through
his
sister
becoming
one
of
the
mistresses
of
the
duke
of
york
it
is
repulsive
to
know
that
marlborough
laid
the
foundation
of
his
wealth
by
being
the
paid
lover
of
one
of
the
fair
and
frail
favourites
of
charles
ii
his
treachery
and
ingratitude
to
his
patron
and
benefactor
james
stand
out
in
dark
relief
even
in
that
age
of
thankless
perfidy
he
was
almost
equally
disloyal
to
his
new
master
king
william
and
a
more
act
can
not
be
recorded
than
godolphin
and
marlborough
betrayal
to
the
french
court
in
of
the
expedition
then
designed
against
brest
an
act
of
treason
which
caused
some
hundreds
of
english
soldiers
and
sailors
to
be
helplessly
slaughtered
on
the
beach
in
camaret
bay
it
is
however
only
in
his
military
career
that
we
have
now
to
consider
him
and
there
are
very
few
generals
of
either
ancient
or
modern
times
whose
campaigns
will
bear
a
comparison
with
those
of
marlborough
either
for
the
masterly
skill
with
which
they
were
planned
or
for
the
bold
yet
prudent
energy
with
which
each
plan
was
carried
into
execution
marlborough
had
served
while
young
under
turenne
and
had
obtained
the
marked
praise
of
that
great
tactician
it
would
be
difficult
indeed
to
name
a
single
quality
which
a
general
ought
to
have
and
with
which
marlborough
was
not
eminently
gifted
what
principally
attracted
the
notice
of
contemporaries
was
the
imperturbable
evenness
of
his
spirit
voltaire
siecle
de
louis
quatorze
says
of
him
he
had
to
a
degree
above
all
other
generals
of
his
time
that
calm
courage
in
the
midst
of
tumult
that
serenity
of
soul
in
danger
which
the
english
call
a
cool
head
que
les
anglais
appellant
cool
head
tete
froid
and
it
was
perhaps
this
quality
the
greatest
gift
of
nature
for
command
which
formerly
gave
the
english
so
many
advantages
over
the
french
in
the
plains
of
cressy
poictiers
and
agincourt
king
william
knowledge
of
marlborough
high
abilities
though
he
knew
his
faithlessness
equally
well
is
said
to
have
caused
that
sovereign
in
his
last
illness
to
recommend
marlborough
to
his
successor
as
the
fittest
person
to
command
her
armies
but
marlborough
favour
with
the
new
queen
by
means
of
his
wife
was
so
high
that
he
was
certain
of
obtaining
the
highest
employment
and
the
war
against
louis
opened
to
him
a
glorious
theatre
for
the
display
of
those
military
talents
which
he
had
before
only
had
an
opportunity
of
exercising
in
a
subordinate
character
and
on
far
less
conspicuous
scenes
he
was
not
only
made
of
the
english
forces
at
home
and
abroad
but
such
was
the
authority
of
england
in
the
council
of
the
grand
alliance
and
marlborough
was
so
skilled
in
winning
golden
opinions
from
all
whom
he
met
with
that
on
his
reaching
the
hague
he
was
received
with
transports
of
joy
by
the
dutch
and
it
was
agreed
by
the
heads
of
that
republic
and
the
minister
of
the
emperor
that
marlborough
should
have
the
chief
command
of
all
the
allied
armies
it
must
indeed
in
justice
to
marlborough
be
borne
in
mind
that
mere
military
skill
was
by
no
means
all
that
was
required
of
him
in
this
arduous
and
invidious
station
had
it
not
been
for
his
unrivalled
patience
and
sweetness
of
temper
and
his
marvellous
ability
in
discerning
the
character
of
those
with
whom
he
had
to
act
his
intuitive
perception
of
those
who
were
to
be
thoroughly
trusted
and
of
those
who
were
to
be
amused
with
the
mere
semblance
of
respect
and
confidence
had
not
marlborough
possessed
and
employed
while
at
the
head
of
the
allied
armies
all
the
qualifications
of
a
polished
courtier
and
a
great
statesman
he
never
would
have
led
the
allied
armies
to
the
danube
the
confederacy
would
not
have
held
together
for
a
single
year
his
great
political
adversary
bolingbroke
does
him
ample
justice

after
referring
to
the
loss
which
king
william
death
seemed
to
inflict
on
the
cause
of
the
allies
observes
that
by
his
death
the
duke
of
marlborough
was
raised
to
the
head
of
the
army
and
indeed
of
the
confederacy
where
he

private

by
merit
and
by
management
a
more
deciding

even
the

given
to

william
not
only
all
the
parts
of
that
vast
machine
the
grand
alliance
were
kept
more
compact
and
entire
but
a
more
rapid
and
vigorous
motion
was
given
to
the
whole
and
instead
of
languishing
and
disastrous
campaigns
we
saw
every
scene
of
the
war
full
of
action

wherein
he
appeared

of

wherein

made
himself
master

and
opened

communication
with
the
french

on

by
this

the

were
enabled
to
assail

in

to
be
despatched
into
hungary
to
assist
and
organize
the
insurgents
in
that
kingdom
and
the
french
grand
army
of
the
danube
was
then
in
collected
and
irresistible
might
to
march
upon
vienna
and
dictate
terms
of
peace
to
the
emperor
high
military
genius
was
shown
in
the
formation
of
this
plan
but
it
was
met
and
baffled
by
a
genius
higher
still
marlborough
had
watched
with
the
deepest
anxiety
the
progress
of
the
french
arms
on
the
rhine
and
in
bavaria
and
he
saw
the
futility
of
carrying
on
a
war
of
posts
and
sieges
in
flanders
while
to
the
empire
were
being
dealt
on
the
danube
he
resolved
therefore
to
let
the
war
in
flanders
languish
for
a
year
while
he
moved
with
all
the
disposable
forces
that
he
could
collect
to
the
central
scenes
of
decisive
operations
such
a
march
was
in
itself
difficult
but
marlborough
had
in
the
first
instance
to
overcome
the
still
greater
difficulty
of
obtaining
the
consent
and
cheerful
of
the
allies
especially
of
the
dutch
whose
frontier
it
was
proposed
thus
to
deprive
of
the
larger
part
of
the
force
which
had
hitherto
been
its
protection
fortunately
among
the
many
slothful
the
many
foolish
the
many
timid
and
the
not
few
treacherous
rulers
statesmen
and
generals
of
different
nations
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
there
were
two
men
eminent
both
in
ability
and
integrity
who
entered
fully
into
marlborough
projects
and
who
from
the
stations
which
they
occupied
were
enabled
materially
to
forward
them
one
of
these
was
the
dutch
statesman
heinsius
who
had
been
the
cordial
supporter
of
king
william
and
who
now
with
equal
zeal
and
good
faith
supported
marlborough
in
the
councils
of
the
allies
the
other
was
the
celebrated
general
prince
eugene
whom
the
austrian
cabinet
had
recalled
from
the
italian
frontier
to
take
the
command
of
one
of
the
emperor
armies
in
germany
to
these
two
great
men
and
a
few
more
marlborough
communicated
his
plan
freely
and
unreservedly
but
to
the
general
councils
of
his
allies
he
only
disclosed
part
of
his
daring
scheme
he
proposed
to
the
dutch
that
he
should
march
from
flanders
to
the
upper
rhine
and
moselle
with
the
british
troops
and
part
of
the
foreign
auxiliaries
and
commence
vigorous
operations
against
the
french
armies
in
that
quarter
whilst
general
auverquerque
with
the
dutch
and
the
remainder
of
the
auxiliaries
maintained
a
defensive
war
in
the
netherlands
having
with
difficulty
obtained
the
consent
of
the
dutch
to
this
portion
of
his
project
he
exercised
the
same
diplomatic
zeal
with
the
same
success
in
urging
the
king
of
prussia
and
other
princes
of
the
empire
to
increase
the
number
of
the
troops
which
they
supplied
and
to
post
them
in
places
convenient
for
his
own
intended
movements
marlborough
commenced
his
celebrated
march
on
the
of
may
the
army
which
he
was
to
lead
had
been
assembled
by
his
brother
general
churchill
at
bedburg
not
far
from
maestricht
on
the
meuse
it
included
sixteen
thousand
english
troops
and
consisted
of
battalions
of
foot
and
squadrons
of
horse
marlborough
was
to
collect
and
join
with
him
on
his
march
the
troops
of
prussia
luneburg
and
hesse
quartered
on
the
rhine
and
eleven
dutch
battalions
that
were
stationed
at
rothweil
coxe
life
of
marlborough
he
had
only
marched
a
single
day
when
the
series
of
interruptions
complaints
and
requisitions
from
the
other
leaders
of
the
allies
began
to
which
he
seemed
doomed
throughout
his
enterprise
and
which
would
have
caused
its
failure
in
the
hands
of
any
one
not
gifted
with
the
firmness
and
the
exquisite
temper
of
marlborough
one
specimen
of
these
annoyances
and
of
marlborough
mode
of
dealing
with
them
may
suffice
on
his
encamping
at
kupen
on
the
he
received
an
express
from
auverquerque
pressing
him
to
halt
because
villeroy
who
commanded
the
french
army
in
flanders
had
quitted
the
lines
which
he
had
been
occupying
and
crossed
the
meuse
at
namur
with
battalions
and
squadrons
and
was
threatening
the
town
of
huys
at
the
same
time
marlborough
received
letters
from
the
margrave
of
baden
and
count
wratislaw
who
commanded
the
imperialist
forces
at
stollhoffen
near
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
stating
that
tallard
had
made
a
movement
as
if
intending
to
cross
the
rhine
and
urging
him
to
hasten
his
march
towards
the
lines
of
stollhoffen
marlborough
was
not
diverted
by
these
applications
from
the
prosecution
of
his
grand
design
conscious
that
the
army
of
villeroy
would
be
too
much
reduced
to
undertake
offensive
operations
by
the
detachments
which
had
already
been
made
towards
the
rhine
and
those
which
must
follow
his
own
march
he
halted
only
a
day
to
quiet
the
alarms
of
auverquerque
to
satisfy
also
the
margrave
he
ordered
the
troops
of
hompesch
and
bulow
to
draw
towards
philipsburg
though
with
private
injunctions
not
to
proceed
beyond
a
certain
distance
he
even
exacted
a
promise
to
the
same
effect
from
count
wratislaw
who
at
this
juncture
arrived
at
the
camp
to
attend
him
during
the
whole
campaign
coxe
marlborough
reached
the
rhine
at
coblentz
where
he
crossed
that
river
and
then
marched
along
its
right
bank
to
broubach
and
mentz
his
march
though
rapid
was
admirably
conducted
so
as
to
save
the
troops
from
all
unnecessary
fatigue
ample
supplies
of
provisions
were
ready
and
the
most
perfect
discipline
was
maintained
by
degrees
marlborough
obtained
more
reinforcements
from
the
dutch
and
the
other
confederates
and
he
also
was
left
more
at
liberty
by
them
to
follow
his
own
course
indeed
before
even
a
blow
was
struck
his
enterprise
had
paralysed
the
enemy
and
had
materially
relieved
austria
from
the
pressure
of
the
war
villeroy
with
his
detachments
from
the
army
was
completely
bewildered
by
marlborough
movements
and
unable
to
divine
where
it
was
that
the
english
general
meant
to
strike
his
blow
wasted
away
the
early
part
of
the
summer
between
flanders
and
the
moselle
without
effecting
anything
marshal
villeroy
says
voltaire
who
had
wished
to
follow
marlborough
on
his
first
marches
suddenly
lost
sight
of
him
altogether
and
only
learned
where
he
really
was
on
hearing
of
his
victory
at
donauwert
siecle
de
louis
xiv
marshal
tallard
who
commanded
thousand
men
at
strasburg
and
who
had
been
destined
by
louis
to
march
early
in
the
year
into
bavaria
thought
that
marlborough
march
along
the
rhine
was
preliminary
to
an
attack
upon
alsace
and
the
marshal
therefore
kept
his
thousand
men
back
in
order
to
support
france
in
that
quarter
marlborough
skilfully
encouraged
his
apprehensions
by
causing
a
bridge
to
be
constructed
across
the
rhine
at
philipsburg
and
by
making
the
landgrave
of
hesse
advance
his
artillery
at
manheim
as
if
for
a
siege
of
landau
meanwhile
the
elector
of
bavaria
and
marshal
marsin
suspecting
that
marlborough
design
might
be
what
it
really
proved
to
be
forbore
to
press
upon
the
austrians
opposed
to
them
or
to
send
troops
into
hungary
and
they
kept
back
so
as
to
secure
their
communications
with
france
thus
when
marlborough
at
the
beginning
of
june
left
the
rhine
and
marched
for
the
danube
the
numerous
hostile
armies
were
uncombined
and
unable
to
check
him
with
such
skill
and
science
had
this
enterprise
been
concerted
that
at
the
very
moment
when
it
assumed
a
specific
direction
the
enemy
was
no
longer
enabled
to
render
it
abortive
as
the
march
was
now
to
be
bent
towards
the
danube
notice
was
given
for
the
prussians
palatines
and
hessians
who
were
stationed
on
the
rhine
to
order
their
march
so
as
to
join
the
main
body
in
its
progress
at
the
same
time
directions
were
sent
to
accelerate
the
advance
of
the
danish
auxiliaries
who
were
marching
from
the
netherlands
coxe
crossing
the
river
neckar
marlborough
marched
in
a
direction
to
mundelshene
where
he
had
his
first
personal
interview
with
prince
eugene
who
was
destined
to
be
his
colleague
on
so
many
glorious
fields
thence
through
a
difficult
and
dangerous
country
marlborough
continued
his
march
against
the
bavarians
whom
he
encountered
on
the
of
july
on
the
heights
of
the
schullenberg
near
donauwert
marlborough
stormed
their
entrenched
camp
crossed
the
danube
took
several
strong
places
in
bavaria
and
made
himself
completely
master
of
the
dominions
except
the
fortified
cities
of
munich
and
augsburg
but
the
elector
army
though
defeated
at
donauwert
was
still
numerous
and
strong
and
at
last
marshal
tallard
when
thoroughly
apprised
of
the
real
nature
of
marlborough
movements
crossed
the
rhine
he
was
suffered
through
the
supineness
of
the
german
general
at
stollhoffen
to
march
without
loss
through
the
black
forest
and
united
his
powerful
army
at
biberach
near
augsburg
with
that
of
the
elector
and
the
french
troops
under
marshal
marsin
who
had
previously
been
with
the
bavarians
on
the
other
hand
marlborough
the
danube
and
on
the
of
august
united
his
army
with
the
imperialist
forces
under
prince
eugene
the
combined
armies
occupied
a
position
near
hochstadt
a
little
higher
up
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
than
donauwert
the
scene
of
marlborough
recent
victory
and
almost
exactly
on
the
ground
where
marshal
villars
and
the
elector
had
defeated
an
austrian
army
in
the
preceding
year
the
french
marshals
and
the
elector
were
now
in
position
a
little
farther
to
the
east
between
blenheim
and
lutzingen
and
with
the
little
stream
of
the
nebel
between
them
and
the
troops
of
marlborough
and
eugene
the
army
consisted
of
about
sixty
thousand
men
and
they
had
pieces
of
artillery
the
army
of
the
allies
was
about
thousand
strong
with
guns
a
short
time
before
the
war
of
the
succession
the
musquet
and
bayonet
had
been
made
the
arms
of
all
the
french
infantry
it
had
formerly
been
usual
to
mingle
with
musqueteers
the
other
european
nations
followed
the
example
of
france
and
the
weapons
used
at
blenheim
were
substantially
the
same
as
those
still
employed
although
the
french
army
of
italy
had
been
unable
to
penetrate
into
austria
and
although
the
masterly
strategy
of
marlborough
had
hitherto
warded
off
the
destruction
with
which
the
cause
of
the
allies
seemed
menaced
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
the
peril
was
still
most
serious
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
marlborough
to
attack
the
enemy
before
villeroy
should
be
roused
into
action
there
was
nothing
to
stop
that
general
and
his
army
from
marching
into
franconia
whence
the
allies
drew
their
principal
supplies
and
besides
thus
distressing
them
he
might
by
marching
on
and
joining
his
army
to
those
of
tallard
and
the
elector
form
a
mass
which
would
overwhelm
the
force
under
marlborough
and
eugene
on
the
other
hand
the
chances
of
a
battle
seemed
perilous
and
the
fatal
consequences
of
a
defeat
were
certain
the
inferiority
of
the
allies
in
point
of
number
was
not
very
great
but
still
it
was
not
to
be
disregarded
and
the
advantage
which
the
enemy
seemed
to
have
in
the
composition
of
their
troops
was
striking
tallard
and
marsin
had
thousand
frenchmen
under
them
all
veterans
and
all
trained
to
act
together
the
elector
own
troops
also
were
good
soldiers
marlborough
like
wellington
at
waterloo
headed
an
army
of
which
the
larger
proportion
consisted
not
of
english
but
of
men
of
many
different
nations
and
many
different
languages
he
was
also
obliged
to
be
the
assailant
in
the
action
and
thus
to
expose
his
troops
to
comparatively
heavy
loss
at
the
commencement
of
the
battle
while
the
enemy
would
fight
under
the
protection
of
the
villages
and
lines
which
they
were
actively
engaged
in
strengthening
the
consequences
of
a
defeat
of
the
confederated
army
must
have
broken
up
the
grand
alliance
and
realised
the
proudest
hopes
of
the
french
king
alison
in
his
admirable
military
history
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
has
truly
stated
the
effects
which
would
have
taken
place
if
france
had
been
successful
in
the
war
and
when
the
position
of
the
confederates
at
the
time
when
blenheim
was
fought
is
remembered
when
we
recollect
the
exhaustion
of
austria
the
menacing
insurrection
of
hungary
the
feuds
and
jealousies
of
the
german
princes
the
strength
and
activity
of
the
jacobite
party
in
england
the
imbecility
of
nearly
all
the
dutch
statesmen
of
the
time
and
the
weakness
of
holland
if
deprived
of
her
allies
we
may
adopt
his
words
in
speculating
on
what
would
have
ensued
if
france
had
been
victorious
in
the
battle
and
if
a
power
animated
by
the
ambition
guided
by
the
fanaticism
and
directed
by
the
ability
of
that
of
louis
had
gained
the
ascendancy
in
europe
beyond
all
question
a
universal
despotic
dominion
would
have
been
established
over
the
bodies
a
cruel
spiritual
thraldom
over
the
minds
of
men
france
and
spain
united
under
bourbon
princes
and
in
a
close
family
alliance
the
empire
of
charlemagne
with
that
of
charles
the
power
which
revolted
the
edict
of
nantes
and
perpetrated
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
with
that
which
banished
the
moriscoes
and
established
the
inquisition
would
have
proved
irresistible
and
beyond
example
destructive
to
the
best
interests
of
mankind
the
protestants
might
have
been
driven
like
the
pagan
heathens
of
old
by
the
son
of
pepin
beyond
the
elbe
the
stuart
race
and
with
them
romish
ascendancy
might
have
been
in
england
the
fire
lighted
by
latimer
and
ridley
might
have
been
extinguished
in
blood
and
the
energy
breathed
by
religious
freedom
into
the
race
might
have
expired
the
destinies
of
the
world
would
have
been
changed
europe
instead
of
a
variety
of
independent
states
whose
mutual
hostility
kept
alive
courage
while
their
national
rivalry
stimulated
talent
would
have
sunk
into
the
slumber
attendant
on
universal
dominion
the
colonial
empire
of
england
would
have
withered
away
and
perished
as
that
of
spain
has
done
in
the
grasp
of
the
inquisition
the
race
would
have
been
arrested
in
its
mission
to
overspread
the
earth
and
subdue
it
the
centralised
despotism
of
the
roman
empire
would
have
been
renewed
on
continental
europe
the
chains
of
romish
tyranny
and
with
them
the
general
infidelity
of
france
before
the
revolution
would
have
extinguished
or
perverted
thought
in
the
british
islands
alison
life
of
marlborough
p
marlborough
words
at
the
council
of
war
when
a
battle
was
resolved
on
are
remarkable
and
they
deserve
recording
we
know
them
on
the
authority
of
his
chaplain
afterwards
bishop
hare
who
accompanied
him
throughout
the
campaign
and
in
whose
journal
the
biographers
of
marlborough
have
found
many
of
their
best
materials
marborough
words
to
the
officers
who
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
seeming
temerity
of
attacking
the
enemy
in
their
position
were
i
know
the
danger
yet
a
battle
is
absolutely
necessary
and
i
rely
on
the
bravery
and
discipline
of
the
troops
which
will
make
amends
for
our
disadvantages
in
the
evening
orders
were
issued
for
a
general
engagement
and
received
by
the
army
with
an
alacrity
which
justified
his
confidence
the
french
and
bavarians
were
posted
behind
a
little
stream
called
the
nebel
which
runs
almost
from
north
to
south
into
the
danube
immediately
in
front
of
the
village
of
blenheim
the
nebel
flows
along
a
little
valley
and
the
french
occupied
the
rising
ground
to
the
west
of
it
the
village
of
blenheim
was
the
extreme
right
of
their
position
and
the
village
of
lutzingen
about
three
miles
north
of
blenheim
formed
their
left
beyond
lutzingen
are
the
rugged
high
grounds
of
the
godd
berg
and
eich
berg
on
the
skirts
of
which
some
detachments
were
posted
so
as
to
secure
the
position
from
being
turned
on
the
left
flank
the
danube
protected
their
right
flank
and
it
was
only
in
front
that
they
could
be
attacked
the
villages
of
blenheim
and
lutzingen

been
strongly
palisadoed

marsin
commanded
on
the
left
tallard
garrisoned
blenheim
with
battalions
of
french
infantry
and
twelve
squadrons
of
french
cavalry
marsin
and
the
elector
had
battalions
of
infantry
and
squadrons
of
cavalry
in
front
of
the
village
of
lutzingen
the
centre
was
occupied
by
fourteen
battalions
of
infantry
including
the
celebrated
irish
brigade
these
were
posted
in
the
little
hamlet
of
oberglau
which
lies
somewhat
nearer
to
lutzingen
than
to
blenheim
eighty
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
seven
battalions
of
foot
were
ranged
between
oberglau
and
blenheim
thus
the
french
position
was
very
strong
at
each
extremity
but
was
comparatively
weak
in
the
centre
tallard
seems
to
have
relied
on
the
swampy
state
of
the
part
of
the
valley
that
reaches
from
below
oberglau
to
blenheim
for
preventing
any
serious
attack
on
this
part
of
his
line
the
army
of
the
allies
was
formed
into
two
great
divisions
the
largest
being
commanded
by
the
duke
in
person
and
being
destined
to
act
against
tallard
while
prince
eugene
led
the
other
division
which
consisted
chiefly
of
cavalry
and
was
intended
to
oppose
the
enemy
under
marsin
and
the
elector
as
they
approached
the
enemy
marlborough
troops
formed
the
left
and
the
centre
while
eugene
formed
the
right
of
the
entire
army
early
in
the
morning
of
the
of
august
the
allies
left
their
own
camp
and
marched
towards
the
enemy
a
thick
haze
covered
the
ground
and
it
was
not
until
the
allied
right
and
centre
had
advanced
nearly
within
of
the
enemy
that
tallard
was
aware
of
their
approach
he
made
his
preparations
with
what
haste
he
could
and
about
eight
a
heavy
fire
of
artillery
was
opened
from
the
french
right
on
the
advancing
left
wing
of
the
british
marlborough
ordered
up
some
of
his
batteries
to
reply
to
it
and
while
the
columns
that
were
to
form
the
allied
left
and
centre
deployed
and
took
up
their
proper
stations
in
the
line
a
warm
cannonade
was
kept
up
by
the
guns
on
both
sides
the
ground
which
eugene
columns
had
to
traverse
was
peculiarly
difficult
especially
for
the
passage
of
the
artillery
and
it
was
nearly
before
he
could
get
his
troops
into
line
opposite
to
lutzingen
during
this
interval
marlborough
ordered
divine
service
to
be
performed
by
the
chaplains
at
the
head
of
each
regiment
and
then
rode
along
the
lines
and
found
both
officers
and
men
in
the
highest
spirits
and
waiting
impatiently
for
the
signal
for
the
the
attack
at
length
an
galloped
up
from
the
right
with
the
welcome
news
that
eugene
was
ready
marlborough
instantly
sent
lord
cutts
with
a
strong
brigade
of
infantry
to
assault
the
village
of
blenheim
while
he
himself
led
the
main
body
down
the
eastward
slope
of
the
valley
of
the
nebel
and
prepared
to
effect
the
passage
of
the
stream
the
assault
on
blenheim
though
bravely
made
was
repulsed
with
severe
loss
and
marlborough
finding
how
strongly
that
village
was
garrisoned
desisted
from
any
further
attempts
to
carry
it
and
bent
all
his
energies
to
breaking
the
enemy
line
between
blenheim
and
oberglau
some
temporary
bridges
had
been
prepared
and
planks
and
fascinas
had
been
collected
and
by
the
aid
of
these
and
a
little
stone
bridge
which
crossed
the
nebel
near
a
hamlet
called
unterglau
that
lay
in
the
centre
of
the
valley
marlborough
succeeded
in
getting
several
squadrons
across
the
nebel
though
it
was
divided
into
several
branches
and
the
ground
between
them
was
soft
and
in
places
little
better
than
a
mere
marsh
but
the
french
artillery
was
not
idle
the
cannon
balls
plunged
incessantly
among
the
advancing
squadrons
of
the
allies
and
bodies
of
french
cavalry
rode
frequently
down
from
the
western
ridge
to
charge
them
before
they
had
time
to
form
on
the
firm
ground
it
was
only
by
supporting
his
men
by
fresh
troops
and
by
bringing
up
infantry
who
checked
the
advance
of
the
enemy
horse
by
their
steady
fire
that
marlborough
was
able
to
save
his
army
in
this
quarter
from
a
repulse
which
following
the
failure
of
the
attack
upon
blenheim
would
probably
have
been
fatal
to
the
allies
by
degrees
his
cavalry
struggled
over
the
streams
the
infantry
were
also
now
brought
across
so
as
to
keep
in
check
the
french
troops
who
held
blenheim
and
who
when
no
longer
assailed
in
front
had
begun
to
attack
the
allies
on
their
left
with
considerable
effect
marlborough
had
thus
at
last
succeeded
in
drawing
up
the
whole
left
wing
of
his
army
beyond
the
nebel
and
was
about
to
press
forward
with
it
when
he
was
called
away
to
another
part
of
the
field
by
a
disaster
that
had
befallen
his
centre
the
prince
of
had
with
eleven
hanoverian
battalions
passed
the
nebel
opposite
to
oberglau
when
he
was
charged
and
utterly
routed
by
the
irish
brigade
which
held
that
village
the
irish
drove
the
hanoverians
back
with
heavy
slaughter
broke
completely
through
the
line
of
the
allies
and
nearly
achieved
a
success
as
brilliant
as
that
which
the
same
brigade
afterwards
gained
at
fontenoy
but
at
blenheim
their
ardour
in
pursuit
led
them
too
far
marlborough
came
up
in
person
and
dashed
in
upon
their
exposed
flank
with
some
squadrons
of
british
cavalry
the
irish
reeled
back
and
as
they
strove
to
regain
the
height
of
oberglau
their
column
was
raked
through
and
through
by
the
fire
of
three
battalions
of
the
allies
which
marlborough
had
summoned
up
from
the
reserve
marlborough
having
the
order
and
communication
of
the
allies
in
this
quarter
now
as
he
returned
to
his
own
left
wing
sent
to
learn
how
his
colleague
fared
against
marsin
and
the
elector
and
to
inform
eugene
of
his
own
success
eugene
had
hitherto
not
been
equally
fortunate
he
had
made
three
attacks
on
the
enemy
opposed
to
him
and
had
been
thrice
driven
back
it
was
only
by
his
own
desperate
personal
exertions
and
the
remarkable
steadiness
of
the
regiments
of
prussian
infantry
which
were
under
him
that
he
was
able
to
save
his
wing
from
being
totally
defeated
but
it
was
on
the
southern
part
of
the
on
the
ground
which
marlborough
had
won
beyond
the
nebel
with
such
difficulty
that
the
crisis
of
the
battle
was
to
be
decided
like
hannibal
marlborough
relied
principally
on
his
cavalry
for
achieving
his
decisive
successes
and
it
was
by
his
cavalry
that
blenheim
the
greatest
of
his
victories
was
won
the
battle
had
lasted
till
five
in
the
afternoon
marlborough
had
now
eight
thousand
horseman
drawn
up
in
two
lines
and
in
the
most
perfect
order
for
a
general
attack
on
the
enemy
line
along
the
space
between
blenheim
and
oberglau
the
infantry
was
drawn
up
in
battalions
in
their
rear
so
as
to
support
them
if
repulsed
and
to
keep
in
check
the
large
masses
of
the
french
that
still
occupied
the
village
of
blenheim
tallard
now
interlaced
his
squadrons
of
cavalry
with
battalions
of
infantry
and
marlborough
by
a
corresponding
movement
brought
several
regiments
of
infantry
and
some
pieces
of
artillery
to
his
front
line
at
intervals
between
the
bodies
of
horse
a
little
after
five
marlborough
commenced
the
decisive
movement
and
the
allied
cavalry
strengthened
and
supported
by
foot
and
guns
advanced
slowly
from
the
lower
ground
near
the
nebel
up
the
slope
to
where
the
french
cavalry
ten
thousand
strong
awaited
them
on
riding
over
the
summit
of
the
acclivity
the
allies
were
received
with
so
hot
a
fire
from
the
french
artillery
and
small
arms
that
at
first
the
cavalry
recoiled
but
without
abandoning
the
high
ground
the
guns
and
the
infantry
which
they
had
brought
with
them
maintained
the
contest
with
spirit
and
effect
the
french
fire
seemed
to
slacken
marlborough
instantly
ordered
a
charge
along
the
line
the
allied
cavalry
galloped
forward
at
the
enemy
squadrons
and
the
hearts
of
the
french
horseman
failed
them
discharging
their
carbines
at
an
idle
distance
they
wheeled
round
and
spurred
from
the
field
leaving
the
nine
infantry
battalions
of
their
comrades
to
be
ridden
down
by
the
torrent
of
the
allied
cavalry
the
battle
was
now
won
tallard
and
marsin
severed
from
each
other
thought
only
of
retreat
tallard
drew
up
the
squadrons
of
horse
which
he
had
left
in
a
line
extended
towards
blenheim
and
sent
orders
to
the
infantry
in
that
village
to
leave
and
join
him
without
delay
but
long
ere
his
orders
could
be
obeyed
the
conquering
squadrons
of
marlborough
had
wheeled
to
the
left
and
thundered
down
on
the
feeble
army
of
the
french
marshal
part
of
the
force
which
tallard
had
drawn
up
for
this
last
effort
was
driven
into
the
danube
part
fled
with
their
general
to
the
village
of
sonderheim
where
they
were
soon
surrounded
by
the
victorious
allies
and
compelled
to
surrender
meanwhile
eugene
had
renewed
his
attack
upon
the
left
and
marsin
finding
his
colleague
utterly
routed
and
his
own
right
flank
uncovered
prepared
to
retreat
he
and
the
elector
succeeded
in
withdrawing
a
considerable
part
of
their
troops
in
tolerable
order
to
dillingen
but
the
large
body
of
french
who
garrisoned
blenheim
were
left
exposed
to
certain
destruction
marlborough
speedily
occupied
all
the
outlets
from
the
village
with
his
victorious
troops
and
then
collecting
his
artillery
round
it
he
commenced
a
cannonade
that
speedily
would
have
destroyed
blenheim
itself
and
all
who
were
in
it
after
several
gallant
but
unsuccessful
attempts
to
cut
their
way
through
the
allies
the
french
in
blenheim
were
at
length
compelled
to
surrender
at
discretion
and
battalions
and
twelve
squadrons
with
all
their
officers
laid
down
their
arms
and
became
the
captives
of
marlborough

voltaire
was
the
celebrated
battle

call

battle
of

to

about

whether
the

of
her

about

in
fresh
enterprises
be
well
or
ill
founded
it
is
certain
that
recent
events
must
have
fearfully
augmented
the
power
of
the
muscovite
empire
which
even
previously
had
been
the
object
of
anxiety
to
all

it
was
truly
stated
twelve
years

that
the

are
equal
in
extent

importance
to
the
whole

than
what
remains
of

ancient

that
her

from

are
as
large
as
the
whole

that
the

she
has
wrested
from
turkey
in

is
equal
to
the
dominions
of
prussia
exclusive
of
her
rhenish

that

the
events
of
the
last
few
years
by
weakening

russia
being
uppermost
in
every
english
statesman
thoughts
but
though
russia
remained
thus
long
unheeded
amid
her
snows
there
was
a
northern
power
the
influence
of
which
was
acknowledged
in
the
principal
european
quarrels
and
whose
good
will
was
sedulously
courted
by
many
of
the
boldest
chiefs
and
ablest
councillors
of
the
leading
states
this
was
sweden
sweden
on
whose
ruins
russia
has
risen
but
whose
ascendancy
over
her
neighbours
was
complete
until
the
fatal
battle
that
now
forms
our
subject
as
early
as
france
had
sought
the
alliance
of
sweden
to
aid
her
in
her
struggle
against
charles
and
the
name
of
gustavus
adolphus
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
remind
us
that
in
the
great
contest
for
religious
liberty
of
which
germany
was
for
thirty
years
the
arena
it
was
sweden
that
rescued
the
falling
cause
of
protestantism
and
it
was
sweden
that
principally
dictated
the
remodelling
of
the
european
state
system
at
the
peace
of
westphalia
from
the
proud
in
which
the
valour
of
the
lion
of
the
north
and
of
torstenston
bannier
wrangel
and
the
other
generals
of
gustavus
guided
by
the
wisdom
of
oxenstiern
had
placed
sweden
the
defeat
of
charles
xii
at
pultowa
hurled
her
down
at
once
and
for
ever
her
efforts
during
the
wars
of
the
french
revolution
to
assume
a
leading
part
in
european
politics
met
with
instant
discomfiture
and
almost
provoked
derision
but
the
sweden
whose
sceptre
was
bequeathed
to
christina
and
whose
alliance
cromwell
valued
so
highly
was
a
different
power
from
the
sweden
of
the
present
day
finland
ingria
livonia
esthonia
carelia
and
other
districts
east
of
the
baltic
then
were
swedish
provinces
and
the
possession
of
pomerania
rugen
and
bremen
made
her
an
important
member
of
the
germanic
empire
these
territories
are
now
all
reft
from
her
and
the
most
valuable
of
them
form
the
staple
of
her
victorious
rival
strength
could
she
resume
them
could
the
sweden
of
be
reconstructed
we
should
have
a
scandinavian
state
in
the
north
well
qualified
to
maintain
the
balance
of
power
and
check
the
progress
of
russia
whose
power
indeed
never
could
have
become
formidable
to
europe
save
by
sweden
becoming
weak
the
decisive
triumph
of
russia
over
sweden
at
pultowa
was
therefore
to
the
world
on
account
of
what
it
overthrew
as
well
as
for
what
it
established
and
it
is
the
more
deeply
interesting
because
it
was
not
merely
the
crisis
of
a
struggle
between
two
states
but
it
was
a
trial
of
strength
between
two
great
races
of
mankind
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
while
the
swedes
like
the
english
the
dutch
and
others
belong
to
the
germanic
race
the
russians
are
a
sclavonic
people
nations
of
sclavonian
origin
have
long
occupied
the
greater
part
of
europe
eastward
of
the
vistula
and
the
populations
also
of
bohemia
croatia
servia
dalmatia
and
other
important
regions
westward
of
that
river
are
sclavonic
in
the
long
and
varied
conflicts
between
them
and
the
germanic
nations
that
adjoin
them
the
germanic
race
had
before
pultowa
almost
always
maintained
a
superiority
with
the
single
but
important
exception
of
poland
no
sclavonic
state
had
made
any
considerable
figure
in
history
before
the
time
when
peter
the
great
won
his
great
victory
over
the
swedish
king
the
hussite
wars
may
perhaps
entitle
bohemia
to
be
distinguished
what
russia
has
done
since
that
time
we
know
and
we
feel
and
some
of
the
wisest
and
best
men
of
our
own
age
and
nation
who
have
watched
with
deepest
care
the
annals
and
the
destinies
of
humanity
have
believed
that
the
sclavonic
element
in
the
population
of
europe
has
as
yet
only
partially
developed
its
powers
that
while
other
races
of
mankind
our
own
the
germanic
included
have
exhausted
their
creative
energies
and
completed
their
allotted
achievements
the
sclavonic
race
has
yet
a
great
career
to
run
and
that
the
narrative
of
sclavonic
ascendancy
is
the
remaining
page
that
will
conclude
the
history
of
the
world
see
arnold
lectures

modern
history
pp
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
in
thus
regarding
the
primary
triumph
of
russia
over
sweden
as
a
victory
of
the
sclavonic
over
the
germanic
race
we
are
dealing
with
matters
of
mere
ethnological
pedantry
or
with
themes
of
mere
speculative
curiosity
the
fact
that
russia
is
a
sclavonic
empire
is
a
fact
of
immense
practical
influence
at
the
present
moment
half
the
inhabitants
of
the
austrian
empire
are
sclavonian
the
population
of
the
larger
part
of
turkey
in
europe
is
of
the
same
race
silesia
posen
and
other
parts
of
the
prussian
dominions
are
principally
sclavonic
and
during
late
years
an
enthusiastic
zeal
for
blending
all
sclavonians
into
one
great
united
sclavonic
empire
has
been
growing
up
in
these
countries
which
however
we
may
deride
its
principle
is
not
the
less
real
and
active
and
of
which
russia
as
the
head
and
champion
of
the
sclavonic
race
knows
well
how
to
take
her
advantage
the
idea
of
panslavism
had
a
purely
literary
origin
it
was
started
by
pollar
a
protestant
clergyman
of
the
sclavonic
congregation
at
pesth
in
hungary
who
wished
to
establish
a
national
literature
by
circulating
all
works
written
in
the
various
sclavonic
dialects
through
every
country
where
any
of
them
are
spoken
he
suggested
that
all
the
slavonic
literati
should
become
acguainted
with
the
sister
dialects
so
that
a
bohemian
or
other
work
might
be
read
on
the
shores
of
the
adriatic
as
well
as
on
the
banks
of
the
volga
or
any
other
place
where
a
sclavonic
language
was
spoken
by
which
means
an
extensive
literature
might
be
created
tending
to
advance
knowledge
in
all
sclavonic
countries
and
he
supported
his
arguments
by
observing
that
the
dialects
of
ancient
greece
differed
from
each
other
like
those
of
his
own
language
and
yet
that
they
formed
only
one
hellenic
literature
the
idea
of
an
intellectual
union
of
all
those
nations
naturally
led
to
that
of
a
political
one
and
the
sclavonians
seeing
that
their
numbers
amounted
to
about
part
of
the
whole
population
of
europe
and
occupied
more
than
half
its
territory
began
to
be
sensible
that
they
might
claim
for
themselves
a
position
to
which
they
had
not
hitherto
aspired
the
opinion
gained
ground
and
the
question
now
is
whether
the
slavonians
can
form
a
nation
independent
of
russia
or
whether
they
ought
to
rest
satisfied
in
being
part
of
one
great
race
with
the
most
powerful
member
of
it
as
their
chief
the
latter
indeed
is
gaining
ground
amongst
them
and
some
poles
are
disposed
to
attribute
their
sufferings
to
the
arbitrary
will
of
the
czar
without
extending
the
blame
to
the
russians
themselves
these
begin
to
think
that
if
they
can
not
exist
as
poles
the
best
thing
to
be
done
is
to
rest
satisfied
with
a
position
in
the
sclavonic
empire
and
they
hope
that
when
once
they
give
up
the
idea
of
restoring
their
country
russia
may
grant
some
concessions
to
their
separate
nationality
the
same
idea
has
been
put
forward
by
writers
in
the
russian
interest
great
efforts
are
making
among
other
sclavonic
people
to
induce
them
to
look
upon
russia
as
their
future
head
and
she
has
already
gained
considerable
influence
over
the
sclavonic
populations
of
turkey
wilkinson
dalmatia
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
russia
owes
her
very
name
to
a
band
of
swedish
invaders
who
conquered
her
a
thousand
years
ago
they
were
soon
absorbed
in
the
sclavonic
population
and
every
trace
of
the
swedish
character
had
disappeared
in
russia
for
many
centuries
before
her
invasion
by
charles
xii
she
was
long
the
victim
and
the
slave
of
the
tartars
and
for
many
considerable
periods
of
years
the
poles
held
her
in
subjugation
indeed
if
we
except
the
expeditions
of
some
of
the
early
russian
chiefs
against
byzantium
and
the
reign
of
ivan
vasilovitch
the
history
of
russia
before
the
time
of
peter
the
great
is
one
long
tale
of
suffering
and
degradation
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
amount
of
national
injuries
that
she
sustained
from
swede
from
tartar
or
from
pole
in
the
ages
of
her
weakness
she
has
certainly
retaliated
during
the
century
and
a
half
of
her
strength
her
rapid
transition
at
the
commencement
of
that
period
from
being
the
prey
of
every
conqueror
to
being
the
conqueror
of
all
with
whom
she
comes
into
contact
to
being
the
oppressor
instead
of
the
oppressed
is
almost
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
nations
it
was
the
work
of
a
single
ruler
who
himself
without
education
promoted
science
and
literature
among
barbaric
millions
who
gave
them
fleets
commerce
arts
and
arms
who
at
pultowa
taught
them
to
face
and
beat
the
previously
invincible
swedes
and
who
made
stubborn
valour
and
implicit
subordination
from
that
time
forth
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
the
russian
soldiery
which
had
before
his
time
been
a
mere
disorderly
and
irresolute
rabble
the
career
of
philip
of
macedon
resembles
most
nearly
that
of
the
great
muscovite
czar
but
there
is
this
important
difference
that
philip
had
while
young
received
in
southern
greece
the
best
education
in
all
matters
of
peace
and
war
that
the
ablest
philosophers
and
generals
of
the
age
could
bestow
peter
was
brought
up
among
barbarians
and
in
barbaric
ignorance
he
strove
to
remedy
this
when
a
grown
man
by
leaving
all
the
temptations
to
idleness
and
sensuality
which
his
court
offered
and
by
seeking
instruction
abroad
he
laboured
with
his
own
hands
as
a
common
artisan
in
holland
and
in
england
that
he
might
return
and
teach
his
subjects
how
ships
commerce
and
civilization
could
be
acquired
there
is
a
degree
of
heroism
here
superior
to
anything
that
we
know
of
in
the
macedonian
king
but
consolidation
of
the
long
disunited
macedonian
empire
his
raising
a
people
which
he
found
the
scorn
of
their
civilized
southern
neighbours
to
be
their
dread
his
organization
of
a
brave
and
army
instead
of
a
disorderly
militia
his
creation
of
a
maritime
force
and
his
systematic
skill
in
acquiring
and
improving
and
arsenals
his
patient
tenacity
of
purpose
under
reverses
his
personal
bravery
and
even
his
proneness
to
coarse
amusements
and
pleasures
all
mark
him
out
as
the
prototype
of
the
imperial
founder
of
the
russian
power
in
justice
however
to
the
ancient
hero
it
ought
to
be
added
that
we
find
in
the
history
of
philip
no
examples
of
that
savage
cruelty
which
deforms
so
grievously
the
character
of
peter
the
great
in
considering
the
effects
of
the
overthrow
which
the
swedish
arms
sustained
at
pultowa
and
in
speculating
on
the
probable
consequences
that
would
have
followed
if
the
invaders
had
been
successful
we
must
not
only
bear
in
mind
the
wretched
state
in
which
peter
found
russia
at
his
accession
compared
with
her
present
grandeur
but
we
must
also
keep
in
view
the
fact
that
at
the
time
when
pultowa
was
fought
his
reforms
were
yet
incomplete
and
his
new
institutions
immature
he
had
broken
up
the
old
russia
and
the
new
russia
which
he
ultimately
created
was
still
in
embryo
had
he
been
crushed
at
pultowa
his
mighty
schemes
would
have
been
buried
with
him
and
to
use
the
words
of
voltaire
the
most
extensive
empire
in
the
world
would
have
relapsed
into
the
chaos
from
which
it
had
been
so
lately
taken
it
is
this
fact
that
makes
the
repulse
of
charles
xii
the
critical
point
in
the
fortunes
of
russia
the
danger
which
she
incurred
a
century
afterwards
from
her
invasion
by
napoleon
was
in
reality
far
less
than
her
peril
when
charles
attacked
her
though
the
french
emperor
as
a
military
genius
was
infinitely
superior
to
the
swedish
king
and
led
a
host
against
her
compared
with
which
the
armies
of
charles
seem
almost
insignificant
but
as
fouche
well
warned
his
imperial
master
when
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
his
disastrous
expedition
against
the
empire
of
the
czars
the
difference
between
the
russia
of
and
the
russia
of
was
greater
than
the
disparity
between
the
power
of
charles
and
the
might
of
napoleon
if
that
heroic
king
said
fouche
had
not
like
your
imperial
majesty
half
europe
in
arms
to
back
him
neither
had
his
opponent
the
czar
peter
soldiers
and
cossacks
the
historians
who
describe
the
state
of
the
muscovite
empire
when
revolutionary
and
imperial
france
encountered
it
narrate
with
truth
and
justice
how
at
the
epoch
of
the
french
revolution
this
immense
empire
comprehending
nearly
half
of
europe
and
asia
within
its
dominions
inhabited
by
a
patient
and
indomitable
race
ever
ready
to
exchange
the
luxury
and
adventure
of
the
south
for
the
hardships
and
monotony
of
the
north
was
daily
becoming
more
formidable
to
the
liberties
of
europe
the
russian
infantry
had
then
long
been
celebrated
for
its
immoveable
firmness
her
immense
population
amounting
then
in
europe
alone
to
nearly
millions
afforded
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
men
her
soldiers
inured
to
heat
and
cold
from
their
infancy
and
actuated
by
a
blind
devotion
to
their
czar
united
the
steady
valour
of
the
english
to
the
impetuous
energy
of
the
french
troops
alison
so
also
we
read
how
the
haughty
aggressions
of
bonaparte
went
to
excite
a
national
feeling
from
the
banks
of
the
borysthenes
to
the
wall
of
china
and
to
unite
against
him
the
wild
and
uncivilized
inhabitants
of
an
extended
empire
possessed
by
a
love
to
their
religion
their
government
and
their
country
and
having
a
character
of
stern
devotion
which
he
was
incapable
of
estimating
scott
life
of
napoleon
but
the
russia
of
had
no
such
forces
to
oppose
to
an
assailant
her
whole
population
then
was
below
sixteen
millions
and
what
is
far
more
important
this
population
had
neither
acquired
military
spirit
nor
strong
nationality
nor
was
it
united
in
loyal
attachment
to
its
ruler
peter
had
wisely
abolished
the
old
regular
troops
of
the
empire
the
strelitzes
but
the
forces
which
he
had
raised
in
their
stead
on
a
new
and
foreign
plan
and
principally
officered
with
foreigners
had
before
the
swedish
invasion
given
no
proof
that
they
could
be
relied
on
in
numerous
encounters
with
the
swedes
peter
soldiery
had
run
like
sheep
before
inferior
numbers
great
discontent
also
had
been
excited
among
all
classes
of
the
community
by
the
arbitrary
changes
which
their
great
emperor
introduced
many
of
which
clashed
with
the
most
cherished
national
prejudices
of
his
subjects
a
career
of
victory
and
prosperity
had
not
yet
raised
peter
above
the
reach
of
that
disaffection
nor
had
superstitious
obedience
to
the
czar
yet
become
the
characteristic
of
the
muscovite
mind
the
victorious
occupation
of
moscow
by
charles
xii
would
have
quelled
the
russian
nation
as
effectually
as
had
been
the
case
when
batou
khan
and
other
ancient
invaders
captured
the
capital
of
primitive
muscovy
how
little
such
a
triumph
could
effect
towards
subduing
modern
russia
the
fate
of
napoleon
demonstrated
at
once
and
for
ever
the
character
of
charles
xii
has
been
a
favourite
theme
with
historians
moralists
philosophers
and
poets
but
it
is
his
military
conduct
during
the
campaign
in
russia
that
alone
requires
comment
here
napoleon
in
the
memoirs
dictated
by
him
at
helena
has
given
us
a
systematic
criticism
on
that
among
other
celebrated
campaigns
his
own
russian
campaign
included
he
labours
hard
to
prove
that
he
himself
observed
all
the
true
principles
of
offensive
war
and
probably
his
censures
of
charles
generalship
were
rather
highly
coloured
for
the
sake
of
making
his
own
military
skill
stand
out
in
more
favourable
relief
yet
after
making
all
allowances
we
must
admit
the
force
of
napoleon
strictures
on
charles
tactics
and
own
that
his
judgment
though
severe
is
correct
when
he
pronounces
that
the
swedish
king
unlike
his
great
predecessor
gustavus
knew
nothing
of
the
art
of
war
and
was
nothing
more
than
a
brave
and
intrepid
soldier
such
however
was
not
the
light
in
which
charles
was
regarded
by
his
contemporaries
at
the
commencement
of
his
russian
expedition
his
numerous
victories
his
daring
and
resolute
spirit
combined
with
the
ancient
renown
of
the
swedish
arms
then
filled
all
europe
with
admiration
and
anxiety
as
johnson
expresses
it
his
name
was
then
one
at
which
the
world
grew
pale
even
louis
le
grand
earnestly
solicited
his
assistance
and
our
own
marlborough
then
in
the
full
career
of
his
victories
was
specially
sent
by
the
english
court
to
the
camp
of
charles
to
propitiate
the
hero
of
the
north
in
favour
of
the
cause
of
the
allies
and
to
prevent
the
swedish
sword
from
being
flung
into
the
scale
in
the
french
favour
but
charles
at
that
time
was
solely
bent
on
dethroning
the
sovereign
of
russia
as
he
had
already
dethroned
the
sovereign
of
poland
and
all
europe
fully
believed
that
he
would
entirely
crush
the
czar
and
dictate
conditions
of
peace
in
the
kremlin
voltaire
attests
from
personal
inspection
of
the
letters
of
several
public
ministers
to
their
respective
courts
that
such
was
the
general
expectation
charles
himself
looked
on
success
as
a
matter
of
certainty
and
the
romantic
extravagance
of
his
views
was
continually
increasing
one
year
he
thought
would
suffice
for
the
conquest
of
russia
the
court
of
rome
was
next
to
feel
his
vengeance
as
the
pope
had
dared
to
oppose
the
concession
of
religious
liberty
to
the
silesian
protestants
no
enterprise
at
that
time
appeared
impossible
to
him
he
had
even
dispatched
several
officers
privately
into
asia
and
egypt
to
take
plans
of
the
towns
and
examine
into
the
strength
and
resources
of
those
countries
crighton
scandinavia
napoleon
thus
epitomises
the
earlier
operations
of
charles
invasion
of
russia
that
prince
set
out
from
his
camp
at
aldstadt
near
leipsic
in
september
at
the
head
of
men
and
traversed
poland
men
under
count
lewenhaupt
disembarked
at
riga
and
were
in
finland
he
was
therefore
in
a
condition
to
have
brought
together
of
the
best
troops
in
the
world
he
left
men
at
warsaw
to
guard
king
stanislaus
and
in
january
arrived
at
grodno
where
he
wintered
in
june
he
crossed
the
forest
of
minsk
and
presented
himself
before
borisov
forced
the
russian
army
which
occupied
the
left
bank
of
the
beresina
defeated
russians
who
were
strongly
entrenched
behind
marshes
passed
the
borysthenes
at
mohiloev
and
vanquished
a
corps
of
muscovites
near
smolensko
on
the
of
september
he
was
now
advanced
to
the
confines
of
lithuania
and
was
about
to
enter
russia
proper
the
czar
alarmed
at
his
approach
made
him
proposals
of
peace
up
to
this
time
all
his
movements
mere
conformable
to
rule
and
his
communications
were
well
secured
he
was
master
of
poland
and
riga
and
only
ten
days
march
distant
from
moscow
and
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
reached
that
capital
had
he
not
quitted
the
high
road
thither
and
directed
his
steps
towards
the
ukraine
in
order
to
form
a
junction
with
mazeppa
who
brought
him
only
men
by
this
movement
his
line
of
operations
beginning
at
sweden
exposed
his
flank
to
russia
for
a
distance
of
four
hundred
leagues
and
he
was
unable
to
protect
it
or
to
receive
either
reinforcements
or
assistance
napoleon
severely
censures
this
neglect
of
one
of
the
great
rules
of
war
he
points
out
that
charles
had
not
organized
his
war
like
hannibal
on
the
principle
of
relinquishing
all
communications
with
home
keeping
all
his
forces
concentrated
and
creating
a
base
of
operations
in
the
conquered
country
such
had
been
the
bold
system
of
the
carthaginian
general
but
charles
acted
on
no
such
principle
inasmuch
as
he
caused
lewenhaupt
one
of
his
generals
who
commanded
a
considerable
detachment
and
escorted
a
most
important
convoy
to
follow
him
at
a
distance
of
twelve
days
march
by
this
dislocation
of
his
forces
he
exposed
lewenhaupt
to
be
overwhelmed
separately
by
the
full
force
of
the
enemy
and
deprived
the
troops
under
his
own
command
of
the
aid
which
that
general
men
and
stores
might
have
afforded
at
the
very
crisis
of
the
campaign
the
czar
had
collected
an
army
of
about
a
hundred
thousand
effective
men
and
though
the
swedes
in
the
beginning
of
the
invasion
were
successful
in
every
encounter
the
russian
troops
were
gradually
acquiring
discipline
and
peter
and
his
officers
were
learning
generalship
from
their
victors
as
the
thebans
of
old
learned
it
from
the
spartans
when
lewenhaupt
in
the
october
of
was
striving
to
join
charles
in
the
ukraine
the
czar
suddenly
attacked
him
near
the
borysthenes
with
an
overwhelming
force
of
fifty
thousand
russians
lewenhaupt
fought
bravely
for
three
days
and
succeeded
in
cutting
his
way
through
the
enemy
with
about
four
thousand
of
his
men
to
where
charles
awaited
him
near
the
river
desna
but
upwards
of
eight
thousand
swedes
fell
in
these
battles
lewenhaupt
cannon
and
ammunition
were
abandoned
and
the
whole
of
his
important
convoy
of
provisions
on
which
charles
and
his
troops
were
relying
fell
into
the
hands
charles
was
compelled
to
remain
in
the
ukraine
during
the
winter
but
in
the
spring
of
he
moved
forward
towards
moscow
and
invested
the
fortified
town
of
pultowa
on
the
river
vorskla
a
place
where
the
czar
had
stored
up
large
supplies
of
provisions
and
military
stores
and
which
commanded
the
roads
leading
towards
moscow
the
possession
of
this
place
would
have
given
charles
the
means
of
supplying
all
the
wants
of
his
suffering
army
and
would
also
have
furnished
him
with
a
secure
base
of
operations
for
his
advance
against
the
muscovite
capital
the
siege
was
therefore
hotly
pressed
by
the
swedes
the
garrison
resisted
obstinately
and
the
czar
feeling
the
importance
of
saving
the
town
advanced
in
june
to
its
relief
at
the
head
of
an
army
from
fifty
to
sixty
thousand
strong
both
sovereigns
now
prepared
for
the
general
action
which
each
perceived
to
be
inevitable
and
which
each
felt
would
be
decisive
of
his
own
and
of
his
country
destiny
the
czar
by
some
masterly
manoeuvres
crossed
the
vorskla
and
posted
his
army
on
the
same
side
of
that
river
with
the
besiegers
but
a
little
higher
up
the
vorskla
falls
into
the
borysthenes
about
fifteen
leagues
below
pultowa
and
the
czar
arranged
his
forces
in
two
lines
stretching
from
one
river
towards
the
other
so
that
if
the
swedes
attacked
him
and
were
repulsed
they
would
be
driven
backwards
into
the
acute
angle
formed
by
the
two
streams
at
their
junction
he
fortified
these
lines
with
several
redoubts
lined
with
heavy
artillery
and
his
troops
both
horse
and
foot
were
in
the
best
possible
condition
and
amply
provided
with
stores
and
ammunition
charles
forces
were
about
thousand
strong
but
not
more
than
half
of
these
were
swedes
so
much
had
battle
famine
fatigue
and
the
deadly
frosts
of
russia
thinned
the
gallant
bands
which
the
swedish
king
and
lewenhaupt
had
led
to
the
ukraine
the
other
twelve
thousand
men
under
charles
were
cossacks
and
wallachians
who
had
joined
him
in
that
country
on
hearing
that
the
czar
was
about
to
attack
him
he
deemed
that
his
dignity
required
that
he
himself
should
be
the
assailant
and
leading
his
army
out
of
their
entrenched
lines
before
the
town
he
advanced
with
them
against
the
russian
redoubts
he
had
been
severely
wounded
in
the
foot
in
a
skirmish
a
few
days
before
and
was
borne
in
a
litter
along
the
ranks
into
the
thick
of
the
fight
notwithstanding
the
fearful
disparity
of
numbers
and
disadvantage
of
position
the
swedes
never
showed
their
ancient
valour
more
nobly
than
on
that
dreadful
day
nor
do
their
cossack
and
wallachian
allies
seem
to
have
been
unworthy
of
fighting
side
by
side
with
veterans
two
of
the
russian
redoubts
were
actually
entered
and
the
swedish
infantry
began
to
raise
the
cry
of
victory
but
on
the
other
side
neither
general
nor
soldiers
flinched
in
their
duty
the
russian
cannonade
and
musketry
were
kept
up
fresh
masses
of
defenders
were
poured
into
the
fortifications
and
at
length
the
exhausted
remnants
of
the
swedish
columns
recoiled
from
the
redoubts
then
the
czar
led
the
infantry
and
cavalry
of
his
first
line
outside
the
works
drew
them
up
steadily
and
skilfully
and
the
action
was
renewed
along
the
whole
fronts
of
the
two
armies
on
the
open
ground
each
sovereign
exposed
his
life
freely
in
the
battle
and
on
each
side
the
troops
fought
obstinately
and
eagerly
under
their
ruler
eye
it
was
not
till
two
hours
from
the
commencement
of
the
action
that
overpowered
by
numbers
the
hitherto
invincible
swedes
gave
way
all
was
then
hopeless
disorder
and
irreparable
rout
driven
downward
to
where
the
rivers
join
the
fugitive
swedes
surrendered
to
their
victorious
pursuers
or
perished
in
the
waters
of
the
borysthenes
only
a
few
hundreds
swam
that
river
with
their
king
and
the
cossack
mazeppa
and
escaped
into
the
turkish
territory
nearly
ten
thousand
lay
killed
and
wounded
in
the
redoubts
and
on
the
field
of
battle
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
the
czar
exclaimed
when
the
strife
was
over
that
the
son
of
the
morning
had
fallen
from
heaven
and
that
the
foundations
of
petersburg
at
length
stood
firm
even
on
that
near
the
ukraine
the
russian
emperor
first
thoughts
were
of
conquests
and
aggrandisement
on
the
baltic
the
peace
of
nystadt
which
transferred
the
fairest
provinces
of
sweden
to
russia
ratified
the
judgment
of
battle
which
was
pronounced
at
pultowa
attacks
on
turkey
and
persia
by
russia
commenced
almost
directly
after
that
victory
and
though
the
czar
failed
in
his
first
attempts
against
the
sultan
the
successors
of
peter
have
one
and
all
carried
on
an
uniformly
aggressive
and
uniformly
successful
system
of
policy
against
turkey
and
against
every
other
state
asiatic
as
well
as
european
which
has
had
the
misfortune
of
having
russia
for
a
neighbour
orators
and
authors
who
have
discussed
the
progress
of
russia
have
often
alluded
to
the
similitude
between
the
modern
extension
of
the
muscovite
empire
and
the
extension
of
the
roman
dominions
in
ancient
times
but
attention
has
scarcely
been
drawn
to
the
closeness
of
the
parallel
between
conquering
russia
and
conquering
rome
not
only
in
the
extent
of
conquests
but
in
the
means
of
effecting
conquest
the
history
of
rome
during
the
century
and
a
half
which
followed
the
close
of
the
second
punic
war
and
during
which
her
largest
acquisitions
of
territory
were
made
should
be
minutely
compared
with
the
history
of
russia
for
the
last
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
main
points
of
similitude
can
only
be
indicated
in
these
pages
but
they
deserve
the
fullest
consideration
above
all
the
sixth
chapter
of
montesquieu
great
treatise
on
rome
the
chapter
de
la
conduite
que
les
romains
tinrent
pour
soumettre
les
peuples
should
be
carefully
studied
by
every
one
who
watches
the
career
and
policy
of
russia
the
classic
scholar
will
remember
the
of
the
roman
senate
which
took
care
in
every
foreign
war
to
appear
in
the
character
of
a
protector
thus
rome
protected
the
aetolians
and
the
greek
cities
against
macedon
she
protected
bithynia
and
other
small
asiatic
states
against
the
syrian
kings
she
protected
numidia
against
carthage
and
in
numerous
other
instances
assumed
the
same
specious
character
but
woe
to
the
people
whose
liberty
depends
on
the
continued
forbearance
of
an
protector
malkin
history
of
greece
every
state
which
rome
protected
was
ultimately
subjugated
and
absorbed
by
her
and
russia
has
been
the

of
poland
the
protector
of
the

the

of

the
protector
of

immeritia
mingrelia
the
tcherkessian
and
caucasian
tribes
she
has
first
protected
and
then
appropriated
them
all
she
protects
moldavia
and
wallachia
a
few
years
ago
she
became
the
protector
of
turkey
from
mehemet
ali
and
since
the
summer
of
she
has
made
herself
the
protector
of
austria
when
the
partisans
of
russia
speak
of
the
disinterestedness
with
which
she
withdrew
her
protecting
troops
from
constantinople
and
from
hungary
let
us
here
also
mark
the
ominous
exactness
of
the
parallel
between
her
and
rome
while
the
ancient
world
yet
contained
a
number
of
independent
states
which
might
have
made
a
formidable
league
against
rome
if
she
had
alarmed
them
by
openly
avowing
her
ambitious
schemes
rome
favourite
policy
was
seeming
disinterestedness
and
moderation
after
her
first
war
against
philip
after
that
against
antiochus
and
many
others
victorious
rome
promptly
withdrew
her
troops
from
the
territories
which
they
occupied
she
affected
to
employ
her
arms
only
for
the
good
of
others
but
when
the
favourable
moment
came
she
always
found
a
pretext
for
marching
her
legions
back
into
each
coveted
district
and
making
it
a
roman
province
fear
not
moderation
is
the
only
effective
check
on
the
ambition
of
such
powers
as
ancient
rome
and
modern
russia
the
amount
of
that
fear
depends
on
the
amount
of
timely
vigilance
and
energy
which
other
states
choose
to
employ
against
the
common
enemy
of
their
freedom
and
national
independence

now
commands
the
admiration
of
mankind
that
homage
is
sometimes
reluctantly
given
and
accompanied
with
suspicion
and
but
none
can
refuse
it
all
the
physical
essentials
for
national
strength
are
undeniably
to
be
found
in
the
geographical
position
and
amplitude
of
territory
which
the
united
states
possess
in
their
almost
inexhaustible
tracts
of
fertile
but
hitherto
untouched
soil
in
their
stately
forests
in
their
and
their
rivers
their
beds
of
coal
and
stores
of
metallic
wealth
in
their
extensive
seaboard
along
the
waters
of
two
oceans
and
in
their
already
numerous
and
rapidly
increasing
population
and
when
we
examine
the
character
of
this
population
no
one
can
look
on
the
fearless
energy
the
sturdy
determination
the
aptitude
for
local
self
government
the
versatile
alacrity
and
the
unresting
spirit
of
enterprise
which
characterise
the
without
feeling
that
he
here
beholds
the
true
moral
elements
of
progressive
might
three
quarters
of
a
century
have
not
yet
passed
away
since
the
united
states
ceased
to
be
mere
dependencies
of
england
and
even
if
we
date
their
origin
from
the
period
when
the
first
permanent
european
settlements
out
of
which
they
grew
were
made
on
the
western
coast
of
the
north
atlantic
the
increase
of
their
strength
is
unparalleled
either
in
rapidity
or
extent
the
ancient
roman
boasted
with
reason
of
the
growth
of
rome
from
humble
beginnings
to
the
greatest
magnitude
which
the
world
had
then
ever
witnessed
but
the
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
still
more
justly
entitled
to
claim
this
praise
in
two
centuries
and
a
half
his
country
has
acquired
ampler
dominion
than
the
roman
gained
in
ten
and
even
if
we
credit
the
legend
of
the
band
of
shepherds
and
outlaws
with
which
romulus
is
said
to
have
colonized
the
seven
hills
we
find
not
there
so
small
a
germ
of
future
greatness
as
we
find
in
the
group
of
a
hundred
and
five
and
disunited
emigrants
who
founded
jamestown
in
or
in
the
scanty
band
of
the
who
a
few
years
later
moored
their
bark
on
the
wild
and
coast
of
the
wilderness
that
was
to
become
new
england
the
power
of
the

is
emphatically
the

nothing
is
more
calculated
to
impress
the
mind
with
a
sense
of
the
rapidity
with
which
the
resources
of
the
american
republic
advance
than
the
difficulty
which
the
historical
inquirer
finds
in
ascertaining
their
precise
amount
if
he
consults
the
most
recent
works
and
those
written
by
the
ablest
investigators
of
the
subject
he
finds
in
them
admiring
comments
on
the
change
which
the
last
few
years
before
those
books
were
written
had
made
but
when
he
turns
to
apply
the
estimates
in
those
books
to
the
present
moment
he
finds
them
wholly
inadequate
before
a
book
on
the
subject
of
the
united
states
has
lost
its
novelty
those
states
have
outgrown
the
description
which
it
contains
the
celebrated
work
of
the
french
statesman
de
tocqueville
appeared
about
fifteen
years
ago
in
the
passage
which
i
am
about
to
quote
it
will
be
seen
that
he
predicts
the
constant
increase
of
the
power
but
he
looks
on
the
rocky
mountains
as
their
extreme
western
limit
for
many
years
to
come
he
had
evidently
no
expectation
of
himself
seeing
that
power
dominant
along
the
pacific
as
well
as
along
the
atlantic
coast
he
says
the
distance
from
lake
superior
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
extends
from
the
to
the
degree
of
latitude
a
distance
of
more
than
miles
as
the
bird
flies
the
frontier
of
the
united
states
winds
along
the
whole
of
this
immense
line
sometimes
falling
within
its
limits
but
more
frequently
extending
far
beyond
it
into
the
waste
it
has
been
calculated
that
the
whites
advance
every
year
a
mean
distance
of
seventeen
miles
along
the
whole
of
this
vast
boundary
obstacles
such
as
an
unproductive
district
a
lake
or
an
indian
nation
unexpectedly
encountered
are
sometimes
met
with
the
advancing
column
then
halts
for
a
while
its
two
extremities
fall
back
upon
themselves
and
as
soon
as
they
are
they
proceed
onwards
this
gradual
and
continuous
progress
of
the
european
race
towards
the
rocky
mountains
has
the
solemnity
of
a
providential
event
it
is
like
a
deluge
of
men
rising
unabatedly
and
daily
driven
onwards
by
the
hand
of
god
within
this
first
line
of
conquering
settlers
towns
are
built
and
vast
estates
founded
in
there
were
only
a
few
thousand
pioneers
sprinkled
along
the
valleys
of
the
mississippi
and
at
the
present
day
these
valleys
contain
as
many
inhabitants
as
were
to
be
found
in
the
whole
union
in
their
population
amounts
to
nearly
four
millions
the
city
of
washington
was
founded
in
in
the
very
centre
of
the
union
but
such
are
the
changes
which
have
taken
place
that
it
now
stands
at
one
of
the
extremities
and
the
delegates
of
the
most
remote
western
states
are
already
obliged
to
perform
a
journey
as
long
so
that
from
vienna
to
paris
it
must
not
then
be
imagined
that
the
impulse
of
the
british
race
in
the
new
world
can
be
arrested
the
dismemberment
of
the
union
and
the
hostilities
which
might
ensue
the
abolition
of
republican
institutions
and
the
tyrannical
government
which
might
succeed
it
may
retard
this
impulse
but
they
can
not
prevent
it
from
ultimately
fulfilling
the
destinies
to
which
that
race
is
reserved
no
power
upon
earth
can
close
upon
the
emigrants
that
fertile
wilderness
which
offers
resources
to
all
industry
and
a
refuge
from
all
want
future
events
of
whatever
nature
they
may
be
will
not
deprive
the
americans
of
their
climate
or
of
their
inland
seas
or
of
their
great
rivers
or
of
their
exuberant
soil
nor
will
bad
laws
revolutions
and
anarchy
be
able
to
obliterate
that
love
of
prosperity
and
that
spirit
of
enterprise
which
seem
to
be
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
their
race
or
to
extinguish
that
knowledge
which
guides
them
on
their
way
thus
in
the
midst
of
the
uncertain
future
one
event
at
least
is
sure
at
a
period
which
may
be
said
to
be
near
for
we
are
speaking
of
the
life
of
a
nation
the
will
alone
cover
the
immense
space
contained
between
the
polar
regions
and
the
tropics
extending
from
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean
the
territory
which
will
probably
be
occupied
by
the
at
some
future
time
may
be
computed
to
equal
of
europe
in
extent
the
climate
of
the
union
is
upon
the
whole
preferable
to
that
of
europe
and
its
natural
advantages
are
not
less
great
it
is
therefore
evident
that
its
population
will
at
some
future
time
be
proportionate
to
our
own
europe
divided
as
it
is
between
so
many
different
nations
and
torn
as
it
has
been
by
incessant
wars
and
the
barbarous
manners
of
the
middle
ages
has
notwithstanding
attained
a
population
of
inhabitants
to
the
square
league
what
cause
can
prevent
the
united
states
from
having
as
numerous
a
population
in
time
the
time
will
therefore
come
when
one
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
men
will
be
living
in
north
america
equal
in
condition
the
progeny
of
one
race
owing
their
origin
to
the
same
cause
and
preserving
the
same
civilization
the
same
language
the
same
religion
the
same
habits
the
same
manners
and
imbued
with
the
same
opinions
propagated
under
the
same
forms
the
rest
is
uncertain
but
this
is
certain
and
it
is
a
fact
new
to
the
world
a
fact
fraught
with
such
portentous
consequences
as
to
baffle
the
efforts
even
of

an

who

and
who
described

only
seven
years

tells
us
the
states
which
on

formed
the

were

new

connecticut
rhode

the

thirteen

the

with
the
exception
of
a
few
small

was
confined
to
the

extending

and

were
those
which
existed
at
the
period
when
they
became

the

according
as
the

have
increased
the
territory
of
the
thirteen
original

of

including

east
of

and
bounded
by

on

michigan
on

occupying
at

then
add
the

at
the
most
limited
calculation
comprehending

the

by

comprehends
a
portion
of
the
earth
surface
equal
to

we
may
add
that
the
population
of
the
states
when
they
declared
their
independence
was
about
two
millions
and
a
half
it
is
now
millions
i
have
quoted
macgregor
not
only
on
account
of
the
clear
and
full
view
which
he
gives
of
the
progress
of
america
to
the
date
when
he
wrote
but
because
his
description
may
be
contrasted
with
what
the
united
states
have
become
even
since
his
book
appeared
only
three
years
after
the
time
when
macgregor
thus
wrote
the
american
president
truly
stated
within
less
than
four
years
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
union
has
been
consummated
all
conflicting
title
to
the
oregon
territory
south
of
the
degree
of
north
latitude
adjusted
and
new
mexico
and
upper
california
have
been
acquired
by
treaty
the
area
of
these
several
territories
contains
square
miles
or
acres
while
the
area
of
the
remaining
states
and
the
territory
not
yet
organized
into
states
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
contains
square
miles
or
acres
these
estimates
show
that
the
territories
recently
acquired
and
over
which
our
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
dominion
have
been
extended
constitute
a
country
more
than
half
as
large
as
all
that
which
was
held
by
the
united
states
before
their
acquisition
if
oregon
be
excluded
from
the
estimate
there
will
still
remain
within
the
limits
of
texas
new

and
california
square

being
an
addition
equal
to
more
than
of
all
the
territory
owned
by
the

before
their

and
including
oregon
nearly
as
great
an
extent
of

as
the
whole
of

only
excepted
the
mississippi
so
lately
the
frontier
of
our
country
is
now
only
its
centre
with
the
addition
of
the
late
acquisitions
the
united
states
are
now
estimated
to
be
nearly
as
large
as
the
whole
of
europe
the
extent
of
the
of
texas
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
upwards
of
miles
of
the
coast
of
upper
california
on
the
pacific

and
of

including
the
straits
of

making
the
whole
extent
of

the

miles
and
the
whole
extent
on
both
the

miles
the

northern
limits
of
the
united
states
round
the
capes
of
florida
to
the
sabine
on
the
eastern
boundary
of
texas
is
estimated
to
be
miles
so
that
the
addition
of
including
oregon
is
very
nearly
as
great
as
all
we
possessed
before
and
excluding
oregon
is
an
addition
of
miles
being
nearly
equal
to
of
the
extent
of
coast
which
we
possessed
before
these
acquisitions
we
have
now
three
great
maritime
fronts
on
the
atlantic
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
pacific
making
in
the
whole
an
extent
of
exceeding
miles
this
is
the
extent
of
the
of
the
united
states
not
including
bays
sounds
and
small
irregularities
of
the
main
shore
and
of
the

if
these
be
included
the

of

of

as
estimated
by
the

in

the

the
american
will
either
buy
or
force
his
way
between
such
populations
as
that
of
china
and
japan
on
the
one
side
and
that
of

the
former
haughty

insolent
the

later
arise
the
results
of
such
a
quarrel
can
not
be
doubted
america
will
scarcely
imitate
the
forbearance
shown
by
england
at
the
end
of
our
late
war
with
the
celestial
empire
and
the
conquests
of
china
and
japan
by
the
fleets
and
armies
of
the
united
states
are
events
which
many
now
living
are
likely
to
witness
compared
with
the
magnitude
of
such
changes
in
the
dominion
of
the
old
world
the
certain
ascendancy
of
the
over
central
and
southern
america
seems
a
matter
of
secondary
importance
well
may
we
repeat
de
tocqueville
words
that
the
growing
power
of
this
commonwealth
is

these
remarks
were
written
in
may
and
now
in
may
a
powerful
squadron
of
american
has
been
sent
to
japan
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
securing
protection
for
the
crews
of
american
vessels
shipwrecked
on
the
japanese
coasts
but
also
evidently
for
important
ulterior
purposes
an
englishman
may
look
and
ought
to
look
on
the
growing
grandeur
of
the
americans
with
no
small
degree
of
generous
sympathy
and
satisfaction
they
like
ourselves
are
members
of
the
great
nation
whose
race
and
language
are
now
overrunning
the
world
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
arnold
and
whatever
differences
of
form
of
government
may
exist
between
us
and
them
whatever
reminiscences
of
the
days
when
though
brethren
we
strove
together
may
rankle
in
the
minds
of
us
the
defeated
party
we
should
cherish
the
bonds
of
common
nationality
that
still
exist
between
us
we
should
remember
as
the
athenians
remembered
of
the
spartans
at
a
season
of
jealousy
and
temptation
that
our
race
is
one
being
of
the
same
blood
speaking
the
same
language
having
an
essential
resemblance
in
our
institutions
and
usages
and
worshipping
in
the
temples
of
the
same
god
herodotus
viii
all
this
may
and
should
be
borne
in
mind
and
yet
an
englishman
can
hardly
watch
the
progress
of
america
without
the
regretful
thought
that
america
once
was
english
and
that
but
for
the
folly
of
our
rulers
she
might
be
english
still
it
is
true
that
the
commerce
between
the
two
countries
has
largely
and
beneficially
increased
but
this
is
no
proof
that
the
increase
would
not
have
been
still
greater
had
the
states
remained
integral
portions
of
the
same
great
empire
by
giving
a
fair
and
just
participation
in
political
rights
these
the
fairest
possessions
of
the
british
crown
might
have
been
preserved
to
it
this
ancient
and
most
noble
monarchy
lord
chatham
would
not
have
been
dismembered
nor
should
we
see
that
which
ought
to
be
the
right
arm
of
our
strength
now
menacing
us
in
every
political
crisis
as
the
most
formidable
rival
of
our
commercial
and
maritime
ascendancy
the
war
which
rent
away
the
north
american
colonies
of
england
is
of
all
subjects
in
history
the
most
painful
for
an
englishman
to
dwell
on
it
was
commenced
and
carried
on
by
the
british
ministry
in
iniquity
and
folly
and
it
was
concluded
in
disaster
and
shame
but
the
contemplation
of
it
can
not
be
evaded
by
the
historian
however
much
it
may
be
abhorred
nor
can
any
military
event
be
said
to
have
exercised
more
important
influence
on
the
future
fortunes
of
mankind
than
the
complete
defeat
of
burgoyne
expedition
in
a
defeat
which
rescued
the
revolted
colonists
from
certain
subjection
and
which
by
inducing
the
courts
of
france
and
spain
to
attack
england
in
their
behalf
ensured
the
independence
of
the
united
states
and
the
formation
of
that
power
which
not
only
america
but
both
europe
and
asia
now
see
and
feel
still
in
proceeding
to
describe
this
decisive
battle
of
the
world
a
very
brief
recapitulation
of
the
earlier
events
of
the
war
may
be
sufficient
nor
shall
i
linger
unnecessarily
on
a
painful
theme
the
five
northern
colonies
of
massachusetts
connecticut
rhode
island
new
hampshire
and
vermont
usually
classed
together
as
the
new
england
colonies
were
the
strongholds
of
the
insurrection
against
the
the
feeling
of
resistance
was
less
vehement
and
general
in
the
central
settlement
of
new
york
and
still
less
so
in
pennsylvania
maryland
and
the
other
colonies
of
the
south
although
everywhere
it
was
formidably
active
virginia
should
perhaps
be
particularised
for
the
zeal
which
its
leading
men
displayed
in
the
american
cause
but
it
was
among
the
descendants
of
the
stern
puritans
that
the
spirit
of
cromwell
and
vane
breathed
in
all
its
fervour
it
was
from
the
new
englanders
that
the
first
armed
opposition
to
the
british
crown
had
been
offered
and
it
was
by
them
that
the
most
stubborn
determination
to
fight
to
the
last
rather
than
waive
a
single
right
or
privilege
had
been
displayed
in
they
had
succeeded
in
forcing
the
british
troops
to
evacuate
boston
and
the
events
of
had
made
new
york
which
the
royalists
captured
in
that
year
the
principal
basis
of
operations
for
the
armies
of
the
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
that
the
hudson
river
which
falls
into
the
atlantic
at
new
york
runs
down
from
the
north
at
the
back
of
the
new
england
states
forming
an
angle
of
about
degrees
with
the
line
of
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
along
which
the
new
england
states
are
situate
northward
of
the
hudson
we
see
a
small
chain
of
lakes
communicating
with
the
canadian
frontier
it
is
necessary
to
attend
closely
to
these
geographical
points
in
order
to
understand
the
plan
of
the
operations
which
the
english
attempted
in
and
which
the
battle
of
saratoga
defeated
the
english
had
a
considerable
force
in
canada
and
in
had
completely
repulsed
an
attack
which
the
americans
had
made
upon
that
province
the
british
ministry
resolved
to
avail
themselves
in
the
next
year
of
the
advantage
which
the
occupation
of
canada
gave
them
not
merely
for
the
purpose
of
defence
but
for
the
purpose
of
striking
a
vigorous
and
crushing
blow
against
the
revolted
colonies
with
this
view
the
army
in
canada
was
largely
reinforced
seven
thousand
veteran
troops
were
sent
out
from
england
with
a
corps
of
artillery
abundantly
supplied
and
led
by
select
and
experienced
officers
large
quantities
of
military
stores
were
also
furnished
for
the
equipment
of
the
canadian
volunteers
who
were
expected
to
join
the
expedition
it
was
intended
that
the
force
thus
collected
should
march
southward
by
the
line
of
the
lakes
and
thence
along
the
banks
of
the
hudson
river
the
british
army
in
new
york
or
a
large
detachment
of
it
was
to
make
a
simultaneous
movement
northward
up
the
line
of
the
hudson
and
the
two
expeditions
were
to
unite
at
albany
a
town
on
that
river
by
these
operations
all
communication
between
the
northern
colonies
and
those
of
the
centre
and
south
would
be
cut
off
an
irresistible
force
would
be
concentrated
so
as
to
crush
all
further
opposition
in
new
england
and
when
this
was
done
it
was
believed
that
the
other
colonies
would
speedily
submit
the
americans
had
no
troops
in
the
field
that
seemed
able
to
baffle
these
movements
their
principal
army
under
washington
was
occupied
in
watching
over
pennsylvania
and
the
south
at
any
rate
it
was
believed
that
in
order
to
oppose
the
plan
intended
for
the
new
campaign
the
insurgents
must
risk
a
pitched
battle
in
which
the
superiority
of
the
royalists
in
numbers
in
discipline
and
in
equipment
seemed
to
promise
to
the
latter
a
crowning
victory
without
question
the
plan
was
ably
formed
and
had
the
success
of
the
execution
been
equal
to
the
ingenuity
of
the
design
the
or
submission
of
the
thirteen
united
states
must
in
all
human
probability
have
followed
and
the
independence
which
they
proclaimed
in
would
have
been
extinguished
before
it
existed
a
second
year
no
european
power
had
as
yet
come
forward
to
aid
america
it
is
true
that
england
was
generally
regarded
with
jealousy
and
and
was
thought
to
have
acquired
at
the
treaty
of
paris
a
preponderance
of
dominion
which
was
perilous
to
the
balance
of
power
but
though
many
were
willing
to
wound
none
had
yet
ventured
to
strike
and
america
if
defeated
in
would
have
been
suffered
to
fall
unaided
in
lord
albemarle
memoirs
of
the
marquis
of
rockingham
is
contained
the
following
remarkable
state
paper
drawn
up
by
king
george
iii
himself
respecting
the
plan
of
burgoyne
expedition
the
original
is
in
the
king
own
hand
remarks
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
from
canada
the
outlines
of
the
plan
seem
to
be
on
a
proper
foundation
the
rank
and
file
of
the
army
now
in
canada
including
the
regiment
of
british
corps
the
brunswicks
and
hanover
amount
to
add
the
eleven
additional
companies
and
four
hundred
hanover
chasseurs
the
total
will
be
as
sickness
and
other
contingencies
must
be
expected
i
should
think
not
above
effectives
can
be
spared
over
lake
champlain
for
it
would
be
highly
imprudent
to
run
any
risk
in
canada
the
fixing
the
stations
of
those
left
in
the
province
may
not
be
quite
right
though
the
plan
proposed
may
be
recommended
indians
must
be
employed
and
this
measure
must
be
avowedly
directed
and
carleton
must
be
in
the
strongest
manner
directed
that
the
apollo
shall
be
ready
by
that
day
to
receive
burgoyne
the
magazines
must
be
formed
with
the
greatest
expedition
at
crown
point
if
possible
possession
must
be
taken
of
lake
george
and
nothing
but
an
absolute
impossibility
of
succeeding
in
this
can
be
an
excuse
for
proceeding
by
south
bay
and
skeenborough
as
sir
howe
does
not
think
of
acting
from
rhode
island
into
the
massachusets
the
force
from
canada
must
join
him
in
albany
the
diversion
on
the
mohawk
river
ought
at
least
to
be
strengthened
by
the
addition
of
the
four
hundred
hanover
chasseurs
the
ordnance
ought
to
furnish
a
complete
proportion
of
intrenching
tools
the
provisions
ought
to
be
calculated
for
a
third
more
than
the
effective
soldiery
and
the
general
ordered
to
avoid
delivering
these
when
the
army
can
be
subsisted
by
the
country
burgoyne
certainly
greatly
undervalues
the
german
recruits
the
idea
of
carrying
the
army
by
sea
to
sir
howe
would
certainly
require
the
leaving
a
much
larger
part
of
it
in
canada
as
in
that
case
the
rebel
army
would
divide
that
province
from
the
immense
one
under
sir
howe
i
greatly
dislike
this
last
idea
burgoyne
had
gained
celebrity
by
some
bold
and
dashing
exploits
in
portugal
during
the
last
war
he
was
personally
as
brave
an
officer
as
ever
headed
british
troops
he
had
considerable
skill
as
a
tactician
and
his
general
intellectual
abilities
and
acquirements
were
of
a
high
order
he
had
several
very
able
and
experienced
officers
under
him
among
whom
were
phillips
and
fraser
his
regular
troops
amounted
exclusively
of
the
corps
of
artillery
to
about
seven
thousand
two
hundred
men
rank
and
file
nearly
half
of
these
were
germans
he
had
also
an
auxiliary
force
of
from
two
to
three
thousand
canadians
he
summoned
the
warriors
of
several
tribes
of
the
red
indians
near
the
western
lakes
to
join
his
army
much
eloquence
was
poured
forth
both
in
america
and
in
england
in
denouncing
the
use
of
these
savage
auxiliaries
yet
burgoyne
seems
to
have
done
no
more
than
montcalm
wolfe
and
other
french
american
and
english
generals
had
done
before
him
but
in
truth
the
lawless
ferocity
of
the
indians
their
unskilfulness
in
regular
action
and
the
utter
impossibility
of
bringing
them
under
any
discipline
made
their
services
of
little
or
no
value
in
times
of
difficulty
while
the
indignation
which
their
outrages
inspired
went
far
to
rouse
the
whole
population
of
the
invaded
districts
into
active
hostilities
against
burgoyne
force
burgoyne
assembled
his
troops
and
confederates
near
the
river
bouquet
on
the
west
side
of
lake
champlain
he
then
on
the
of
june
gave
his
red
allies
a
and
harangued
them
on
the
necessity
of
abstaining
from
their
usual
cruel
practices
against
unarmed
people
and
prisoners
at
the
same
time
he
published
a
pompous
manifesto
to
the
americans
in
which
he
threatened
the
refractory
with
all
the
horrors
of
war
indian
as
well
as
european
the
army
proceeded
by
water
to
crown
point
a
fortification
which
the
americans
held
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
inlet
by
which
the
water
from
lake
george
is
conveyed
to
lake
champlain
he
landed
here
without
opposition
but
the
reduction
of
ticonderoga
a
fortification
about
twelve
miles
to
the
south
of
crown
point
was
a
more
serious
matter
and
was
supposed
to
be
the
critical
part
of
the
expedition
ticonderoga
commanded
the
passage
along
the
lakes
and
was
considered
to
be
the
key
to
the
route
which
burgoyne
wished
to
follow
the
english
had
been
repulsed
in
an
attack
on
it
in
the
war
with
the
french
in
with
severe
loss
but
burgoyne
now
invested
it
with
great
skill
and
the
american
general
clair
who
had
only
an
army
of
about
three
thousand
men
evacuated
it
on
the
of
july
it
seems
evident
that
a
different
course
would
have
caused
the
destruction
or
capture
of
his
whole
army
which
weak
as
it
was
was
the
chief
force
then
in
the
field
for
the
protection
of
the
new
england
states
when
censured
by
some
of
his
countrymen
for
abandoning
ticonderoga
clair
truly
replied
that
he
had
lost
a
post
but
saved
a
province
burgoyne
troops
pursued
the
retiring
americans
gained
several
advantages
over
them
and
took
a
large
part
of
their
artillery
and
military
stores
the
loss
of
the
british
in
these
engagements
was
trifling
the
army
moved
southward
along
lake
george
to
skenesborough
and
thence
slowly
and
with
great
difficulty
across
a
broken
country
full
of
creeks
and
marshes
and
clogged
by
the
enemy
with
felled
trees
and
other
obstacles
to
fort
edward
on
the
hudson
river
the
american
troops
continuing
to
retire
before
them
burgoyne
reached
the
left
bank
of
the
hudson
river
on
the
of
july
hitherto
he
had
overcome
every
difficulty
which
the
enemy
and
the
nature
of
the
country
had
placed
in
his
way
his
army
was
in
excellent
order
and
in
the
highest
spirits
and
the
peril
of
the
expedition
seemed
over
when
they
were
once
on
the
bank
of
the
river
which
was
to
be
the
channel
of
communication
between
them
and
the
british
army
in
the
south
but
their
feelings
and
those
of
the
english
nation
in
general
when
their
successes
were
announced
may
best
be
learned
from
a
contemporary
writer
burke
in
the
annual
register
for
describes
them
thus
such
was
the
rapid
torrent
of
success
which
swept
everything
away
before
the
northern
army
in
its
onset
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
both
officers
and
private
men
were
highly
elated
with
their
good
fortune
and
deemed
that
and
their
prowess
to
be
irresistible
if
they
regarded
their
enemy
with
the
greatest
contempt
considered
their
own
toils
to
be
nearly
at
an
end
albany
to
be
already
in
their
hands
and
the
reduction
of
the
northern
provinces
to
be
rather
a
matter
of
some
time
than
an
arduous
task
full
of
difficulty
and
danger
at
home
the
joy
and
exultation
was
extreme
not
only
at
court
but
with
all
those
who
hoped
or
wished
the
unqualified
subjugation
and
unconditional
submission
of
the
colonies
the
loss
in
reputation
was
greater
to
the
americans
and
capable
of
more
fatal
consequences
than
even
that
of
ground
of
posts
of
artillery
or
of
men
all
the
contemptuous
and
most
degrading
charges
which
had
been
made
by
their
enemies
of
their
wanting
the
resolution
and
abilities
of
men
even
in
their
defence
of
whatever
was
dear
to
them
were
now
repeated
and
believed
those
who
still
regarded
them
as
men
and
who
had
not
yet
lost
all
affection
to
them
as
brethren
who
also
retained
hopes
that
a
happy
reconciliation
upon
constitutional
principles
without
sacrificing
the
dignity
or
the
just
authority
of
government
on
the
one
side
or
a
dereliction
of
the
rights
of
freemen
on
the
other
was
not
even
now
impossible
notwithstanding
their
favourable
dispositions
in
general
could
not
help
feeling
upon
this
occasion
that
the
americans
sunk
not
a
little
in
their
estimation
it
was
not
difficult
to
diffuse
an
opinion
that
the
war
in
effect
was
over
and
that
any
further
resistance
could
serve
only
to
render
the
terms
of
their
submission
the
worse
such
were
some
of
the
immediate
effects
of
the
loss
of
those
grand
keys
of
north
america
ticonderoga
and
the
lakes
the
astonishment
and
alarm
which
these
events
produced
among
the
americans
were
naturally
great
but
in
the
midst
of
their
disasters
none
of
the
colonists
showed
any
disposition
to
submit
the
local
governments
of
the
new
england
states
as
well
as
the
congress
acted
with
vigour
and
firmness
in
their
efforts
to
repel
the
enemy
general
gates
was
sent
to
take
command
of
the
army
at
saratoga
and
arnold
a
favourite
leader
of
the
americans
was
despatched
by
washington
to
act
under
him
with
reinforcements
of
troops
and
guns
from
the
main
american
army
burgoyne
employment
of
the
indians
now
produced
the
worst
possible
effects
though
he
laboured
hard
to
check
the
atrocities
which
they
were
accustomed
to
commit
he
could
not
prevent
the
occurrence
of
many
barbarous
outrages
repugnant
both
to
the
feelings
of
humanity
and
to
the
laws
of
civilized
warfare
the
american
commanders
took
care
that
the
reports
of
these
excesses
should
be
circulated
far
and
wide
well
knowing
that
they
would
make
the
stern
new
englanders
not
droop
but
rage
such
was
their
effect
and
though
when
each
man
looked
upon
his
wife
his
children
his
sisters
or
his
aged
parents
the
thought
of
the
merciless
indian
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
man
woman
and
child
of
the
cannibal
savage
torturing
murdering
roasting
and
eating
the
mangled
victims
of
his
barbarous
battles
lord
chatham
speech
on
the
employment
of
indians
in
the
war
might
raise
terror
in
the
bravest
breasts
this
very
terror
produced
a
directly
contrary
effect
to
causing
submission
to
the
royal
army
it
was
seen
that
the
few
friends
of
the
royal
cause
as
well
as
its
enemies
were
liable
to
be
the
victims
of
the
indiscriminate
rage
of
the
savages
see
in
the
annual
register
for
the
narrative
of
the
murder
of
miss
the
daughter
of
an
american
loyalist
and
thus
the
inhabitants
of
the
open
and
frontier
countries
had
no
choice
of
acting
they
had
no
means
of
security
left
but
by
abandoning
their
habitations
and
taking
up
arms
every
man
saw
the
necessity
of
becoming
a
temporary
soldier
not
only
for
his
own
security
but
for
the
protection
and
defence
of
those
connexions
which
are
dearer
than
life
itself
thus
an
army
was
poured
forth
by
the
woods
mountains
and
marshes
which
in
this
part
were
thickly
sown
with
plantations
and
villages
the
americans
recalled
their
courage
and
when
their
regular
army
seemed
to
be
entirely
wasted
the
spirit
of
the
country
produced
a
much
greater
and
more
formidable
force
burke
while
resolute
recruits
accustomed
to
the
use
of
and
all
partially
trained
by
service
in
the
provincial
militias
were
thus
flocking
to
the
standard
of
gates
and
arnold
at
saratoga
and
while
burgoyne
was
engaged
at
port
edward
in
providing
the
means
for
the
further
advance
of
his
army
through
the
intricate
and
hostile
country
that
still
lay
before
him
two
events
occurred
in
each
of
which
the
british
sustained
loss
and
the
americans
obtained
advantage
the
moral
effects
of
which
were
even
more
important
than
the
immediate
result
of
the
encounters
when
burgoyne
left
canada
general
leger
was
detached
from
that
province
with
a
mixed
force
of
about
one
thousand
men
and
some
light
across
lake
ontario
against
fort
stanwix
which
the
americans
held
after
capturing
this
he
was
to
march
along
the
mohawk
river
to
its
confluence
with
the
hudson
between
saratoga
and
albany
where
his
force
and
that
of
burgoyne
were
to
unite
but
after
some
successes
leger
was
obliged
to
retreat
and
to
abandon
his
tents
and
large
quantities
of
stores
to
the
garrison
at
the
very
time
that
general
burgoyne
heard
of
this
disaster
he
experienced
one
still
more
severe
in
the
defeat
of
colonel
baum
with
a
large
detachment
of
german
troops
at
benington
whither
burgoyne
had
sent
them
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
some
magazines
of
provisions
of
which
the
british
army
stood
greatly
in
need
the
americans
augmented
by
continual
accessions
of
strength
succeeded
after
many
attacks
in
breaking
this
corps
which
fled
into
the
woods
and
left
its
commander
mortally
wounded
on
the
field
they
then
marched
against
a
force
of
five
hundred
grenadiers
and
light
infantry
which
was
advancing
to
colonel
baum
assistance
under
breyman
who
after
a
gallant
resistance
was
obliged
to
retreat
on
the
main
army
the
british
loss
in
these
two
actions
exceeded
six
hundred
men
and
a
party
of
american
loyalists
on
their
way
to
join
the
army
having
attached
themselves
to
colonel
baum
corps
were
destroyed
with
it
notwithstanding
these
reverses
which
added
greatly
to
the
spirit
and
numbers
of
the
american
forces
burgoyne
determined
to
advance
it
was
impossible
any
longer
to
keep
up
his
communications
with
canada
by
way
of
the
lakes
so
as
to
supply
his
army
on
his
southward
march
but
having
by
unremitting
exertions
collected
provisions
for
thirty
days
he
crossed
the
hudson
by
means
of
a
bridge
of
rafts
and
marching
a
short
distance
along
its
western
bank
he
encamped
on
the
of
september
on
the
heights
of
saratoga
about
sixteen
miles
from
albany
the
americans
had
fallen
back
from
saratoga
and
were
now
strongly
posted
near
stillwater
about
half
way
between
saratoga
and
albany
and
showed
a
determination
to
recede
no
farther
meanwhile
lord
howe
with
the
bulk
of
the
british
army
that
had
lain
at
new
york
had
sailed
away
to
the
delaware
and
there
commenced
a
campaign
against
washington
in
which
the
english
general
took
philadelphia
and
gained
other
showy
but
unprofitable
successes
but
sir
henry
clinton
a
brave
and
skilful
officer
was
left
with
a
considerable
force
at
new
york
and
he
undertook
the
task
of
moving
up
the
hudson
to
with
burgoyne
clinton
was
obliged
for
this
purpose
to
wait
for
reinforcements
which
had
been
promised
from
england
and
these
did
not
arrive
till
september
as
soon
as
he
received
them
clinton
embarked
about
of
his
men
on
a
flotilla
convoyed
by
some
ships
of
war
under
commander
hotham
and
proceeded
to
force
his
may
up
the
river
but
it
was
long
before
he
was
able
to
open
any
communication
with
burgoyne
the
country
between
burgoyne
position
at
saratoga
and
that
of
the
americans
at
stillwater
was
rugged
and
seamed
with
creeks
and
but
after
great
labour
in
making
bridges
and
temporary
causeways
the
british
army
moved
forward
about
four
miles
from
saratoga
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
september
a
sharp
encounter
took
place
between
part
of
the
english
right
wing
under
burgoyne
himself
and
a
strong
body
of
the
enemy
under
gates
and
arnold
the
conflict
lasted
till
sunset
the
british
remained
masters
of
the
field
but
the
loss
on
each
side
was
nearly
equal
from
five
hundred
to
six
hundred
men
and
the
spirits
of
the
americans
were
greatly
raised
by
having
withstood
the
best
regular
troops
of
the
english
army
burgoyne
now
halted
again
and
strengthened
his
position
by
and
redoubts
and
the
americans
also
improved
their
defences
the
two
armies
remained
nearly
within
of
each
other
for
a
considerable
time
during
which
burgoyne
was
anxiously
looking
for
intelligence
of
the
promised
expedition
from
new
york
which
according
to
the
original
plan
ought
by
this
time
to
have
been
approaching
albany
from
the
south
at
last
a
messenger
from
clinton
made
his
way
with
great
difficulty
to
burgoyne
camp
and
brought
the
information
that
clinton
was
on
his
way
up
the
hudson
to
attack
the
american
forts
which
barred
the
passage
up
that
river
to
albany
burgoyne
in
reply
on
the
of
september
urged
clinton
to
attack
the
forts
as
speedily
as
possible
stating
that
the
effect
of
such
an
attack
or
even
the
semblance
of
it
would
be
to
move
the
american
army
from
its
position
before
his
own
troops
by
another
messenger
who
reached
clinton
on
the
of
october
burgoyne
informed
his
brother
general
that
he
had
lost
his
communications
with
canada
but
had
provisions
which
would
last
him
till
the
burgoyne
described
himself
as
strongly
posted
and
stated
that
though
the
americans
in
front
of
him
were
strongly
posted
also
he
made
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
force
them
and
making
his
way
to
albany
but
that
he
doubted
whether
he
could
subsist
there
as
the
country
was
drained
of
provisions
he
wished
clinton
to
meet
him
there
and
to
keep
open
a
communication
with
new
york
see
the
letters
of
general
clinton
to
general
harvey
published
by
lord
albemarle
in
his
memoirs
of
the
marquis
of
rockingham
vol
ii
et
seq
burgoyne
had
his
resources
and
in
the
very
beginning
of
october
found
difficulty
and
distress
pressing
him
hard
the
indians
and
canadians
began
to
desert
him
while
on
the
other
hand
gates
army
was
continually
reinforced
by
fresh
bodies
of
the
militia
an
expeditionary
force
was
detached
by
the
americans
which
made
a
bold
though
unsuccessful
attempt
to
retake
ticonderoga
and
finding
the
number
and
spirit
of
the
enemy
to
increase
daily
and
his
own
stores
of
provision
to
diminish
burgoyne
determined
on
attacking
the
americans
in
front
of
him
and
by
dislodging
them
from
their
position
to
gain
the
means
of
moving
upon
albany
or
at
least
of
relieving
his
troops
from
the
straitened
position
in
which
they
were
cooped
up
burgoyne
force
was
now
reduced
to
less
than
men
the
right
of
his
camp
was
on
some
high
ground
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
river
thence
his
entrenchments
extended
along
the
lower
ground
to
the
bank
of
the
hudson
the
line
of
their
front
being
nearly
at
a
right
angle
with
the
course
of
the
stream
the
lines
were
fortified
with
redoubts
and
and
on
a
height
on
the
bank
of
the
extreme
right
a
strong
redoubt
was
reared
and
entrenchments
in
a
form
thrown
up
the
hessians
under
colonel
breyman
were
stationed
here
forming
a
flank
defence
to
burgoyne
main
army
the
numerical
force
of
the
americans
was
now
greater
than
the
british
even
in
regular
troops
and
the
numbers
of
the
militia
and
volunteers
which
had
joined
gates
and
arnold
were
greater
still
general
lincoln
with
new
england
troops
had
reached
the
american
camp
on
the
of
september
gates
gave
him
the
command
of
the
right
wing
and
took
in
person
the
command
of
the
left
wing
which
was
composed
of
two
brigades
under
generals
poor
and
leonard
of
colonel
morgan
rifle
corps
and
part
of
the
fresh
new
england
militia
the
whole
of
the
american
lines
had
been
ably
fortified
under
the
direction
of
the
celebrated
polish
general
kosciusko
who
was
now
serving
as
a
volunteer
in
gates
army
the
right
of
the
american
position
that
is
to
say
the
part
of
it
nearest
to
the
river
was
too
strong
to
be
assailed
with
any
prospect
of
success
and
burgoyne
therefore
determined
to
endeavour
to
force
their
left
for
this
purpose
he
formed
a
column
of
regular
troops
with
two
two
howitzers
and
six
he
headed
this
in
person
having
generals
phillips
reidesel
and
fraser
under
him
the
enemy
force
immediately
in
front
of
his
lines
was
so
strong
that
he
dared
not
weaken
the
troops
who
guarded
them
by
detaching
any
more
to
strengthen
his
column
of
attack
it
was
on
the
of
october
that
burgoyne
led
his
column
forward
and
on
the
preceding
day
the
clinton
had
successfully
executed
a
brilliant
enterprise
against
the
two
american
forts
which
barred
his
progress
up
the
hudson
he
had
captured
them
both
with
severe
loss
to
the
american
forces
opposed
to
him
he
had
destroyed
the
fleet
which
the
americans
had
been
forming
on
the
hudson
under
the
protection
of
their
forts
and
the
upward
river
was
laid
open
to
his
squadron
he
had
also
with
admirable
skill
and
industry
collected
in
small
vessels
such
as
could
float
within
a
few
miles
of
albany
provisions
sufficient
to
supply
burgoyne
army
for
six
months
see
clinton
letters
in
lord
albemarle
p
he
was
now
only
a
hundred
and
miles
distant
from
burgoyne
and
a
detachment
of
men
actually
advanced
within
forty
miles
of
albany
unfortunately
burgoyne
and
clinton
were
each
ignorant
of
the
other
movements
but
if
burgoyne
had
won
his
battle
on
the
he
must
on
advancing
have
soon
learned
the
tidings
of
clinton
success
and
clinton
would
have
heard
of
his
a
junction
would
soon
have
been
made
of
the
two
victorious
armies
and
the
great
objects
of
the
campaign
might
yet
have
been
accomplished
all
depended
on
the
fortune
of
the
column
with
which
burgoyne
on
the
eventful
of
october
advanced
against
the
american
position
there
were
brave
men
both
english
and
german
in
its
ranks
and
in
particular
it
comprised
one
of
the
best
bodies
of
grenadiers
in
the
british
service
i
am
indebted
for
many
of
the
details
of
the
battle
to
mr
of
the
revolution
burgoyne
pushed
forward
some
bodies
of
irregular
troops
to
distract
the
enemy
attention
and
led
his
column
to
within
of
a
mile
from
the
left
of
gates
camp
and
then
deployed
his
men
into
line
the
grenadiers
under
major
ackland
and
the
artillery
under
major
williams
were
drawn
up
on
the
left
a
corps
of
germans
under
general
reidesel
and
some
british
troops
under
general
phillips
were
in
the
centre
and
the
english
light
infantry
and
the
regiment
under
lord
balcarres
and
general
fraser
were
on
the
right
but
gates
did
not
wait
to
be
attacked
and
directly
the
british
line
was
formed
and
began
to
advance
the
american
general
with
admirable
skill
caused
general
brigade
of
new
york
and
new
hampshire
troops
and
part
of
general
leonard
brigade
to
make
a
sudden
and
vehement
rush
against
its
left
and
at
the
same
time
sent
colonel
morgan
with
his
rifle
corps
and
other
troops
amounting
to
to
turn
the
right
of
the
english
the
grenadiers
under
ackland
sustained
the
charge
of
superior
numbers
nobly
but
gates
sent
more
americans
forward
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
action
became
general
along
the
centre
so
as
to
prevent
the
germans
from
detaching
any
help
to
the
grenadiers
morgan
with
his
riflemen
was
now
pressing
lord
balcarres
and
general
fraser
hard
and
fresh
masses
of
the
enemy
were
observed
advancing
from
their
extreme
left
with
the
evident
intention
of
forcing
the
british
right
and
cutting
off
its
retreat
the
english
light
infantry
and
the
now
fell
back
and
formed
an
oblique
second
line
which
enabled
them
to
baffle
this
manoeuvre
and
also
to
succour
their
comrades
in
the
left
wing
the
gallant
grenadiers
who
were
overpowered
by
superior
numbers
and
but
for
this
aid
must
have
been
cut
to
pieces
the
contest
now
was
fiercely
maintained
on
both
sides
the
english
cannon
were
repeatedly
taken
and
retaken
but
when
the
grenadiers
near
them
were
forced
back
by
the
weight
of
superior
numbers
one
of
the
guns
was
permanently
captured
by
the
americans
and
turned
upon
the
english
major
williams
and
major
ackland
were
both
made
prisoners
and
in
this
part
of
the
field
the
advantage
of
the
americans
was
decided
the
british
centre
still
held
its
ground
but
now
it
was
that
the
american
general
arnold
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
did
more
for
his
countrymen
than
whole
battalions
could
have
effected
arnold
when
the
decisive
engagement
of
the
of
october
commenced
had
been
deprived
of
his
command
by
gates
in
consequence
of
a
quarrel
between
them
about
the
action
of
the
of
september
he
had
listened
for
a
short
time
in
the
american
camp
to
the
thunder
of
the
battle
in
which
he
had
no
military
right
to
take
part
either
as
commander
or
as
combatant
but
his
excited
spirit
could
not
long
endure
such
a
state
of
inaction
he
called
for
his
horse
a
powerful
brown
charger
and
springing
on
it
galloped
furiously
to
where
the
fight
seemed
to
be
the
thickest
gates
saw
him
and
sent
an
to
recall
him
but
arnold
spurred
far
in
advance
and
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
three
regiments
which
had
formerly
been
under
him
and
which
welcomed
their
old
commander
with
joyous
cheers
he
led
them
instantly
upon
the
british
centre
and
then
galloping
along
the
american
line
he
issued
orders
for
a
renewed
and
a
closer
attack
which
were
obeyed
with
alacrity
arnold
himself
setting
the
example
of
the
most
daring
personal
bravery
and
charging
more
than
once
sword
in
hand
into
the
english
ranks
on
the
british
side
the
officers
did
their
duty
nobly
but
general
fraser
was
the
most
eminent
of
them
all
restoring
order
wherever
the
line
began
to
waver
and
infusing
fresh
courage
into
his
men
by
voice
and
example
mounted
on
an
charger
and
dressed
in
the
full
uniform
of
a
general
officer
he
was
conspicuous
to
foes
as
well
as
to
friends
the
american
colonel
morgan
thought
that
the
fate
of
the
battle
rested
on
this
gallant
man
life
and
calling
several
of
his
best
marksman
round
him
pointed
fraser
out
and
said
that
officer
is
general
fraser
i
admire
him
but
he
must
die
our
victory
depends
on
it
take
your
stations
in
that
clump
of
bushes
and
do
your
duty
within
five
minutes
fraser
fell
mortally
wounded
and
was
carried
to
the
british
camp
by
two
grenadiers
just
previously
to
his
being
struck
by
the
fatal
bullet
one
had
cut
the
crupper
of
his
saddle
and
smother
had
passed
through
his
mane
close
behind
the
ears
his
had
noticed
this
and
said
it
is
evident
that
you
are
marked
out
for
particular
aim
would
it
not
be
prudent
for
you
to
retire
from
this
place
fraser
replied
my
duty
forbids
me
to
fly
from
danger
and
the
next
moment
he
fell
lossing
burgoyne
whole
force
was
now
compelled
to
retreat
towards
their
camp
the
left
and
centre
were
in
complete
disorder
but
the
light
infantry
and
the
checked
the
fury
of
the
assailants
and
the
remains
of
the
column
with
great
difficulty
effected
their
return
to
their
camp
leaving
six
of
their
cannons
in
the
possession
of
the
enemy
and
great
numbers
of
killed
and
wounded
on
the
field
and
especially
a
large
proportion
of
the
artillerymen
who
had
stood
to
their
guns
until
shot
down
or
bayoneted
beside
them
by
the
advancing
americans
burgoyne
column
had
been
defeated
but
the
action
was
not
yet
over
the
english
had
scarcely
entered
the
camp
when
the
americans
pursuing
their
success
assaulted
it
in
several
places
with
remarkable
impetuosity
rushing
in
upon
the
intrenchments
and
redoubts
through
a
severe
fire
of
and
musketry
arnold
especially
who
on
this
day
appeared
maddened
with
the
thirst
of
combat
and
carnage
urged
on
the
attack
against
a
part
of
the
intrenchments
which
was
occupied
by
the
light
infantry
under
lord
balcarres
botta
american
war
book
viii
but
the
english
received
him
with
vigour
and
spirit
the
struggle
here
was
obstinate
and
sanguinary
at
length
as
it
grew
towards
evening
arnold
having
forced
all
obstacles
entered
the
works
with
some
of
the
most
fearless
of
his
followers
but
in
this
critical
moment
of
glory
and
danger
he
received
a
painful
wound
in
the
same
leg
which
had
already
been
injured
at
the
assault
on
quebec
to
his
bitter
regret
he
was
obliged
to
be
carried
back
his
party
still
continued
the
attack
but
the
english
also
continued
their
obstinate
resistance
and
at
last
night
fell
and
the
assailants
withdrew
from
this
quarter
of
the
british
intrenchments
but
in
another
part
the
attack
had
been
more
successful
a
body
of
the
americans
under
colonel
brooke
forced
their
way
in
through
a
part
of
the
intrenchments
on
the
extreme
right
which
was
defended
by
the
hessian
reserve
under
colonel
breyman
the
germans
resisted
well
and
breyman
died
in
defence
of
his
post
but
the
americans
made
good
the
ground
which
they
had
won
and
captured
baggage
tents
artillery
and
a
store
of
ammunition
which
they
were
greatly
in
need
of
they
had
by
establishing
themselves
on
this
point
acquired
the
means
of
completely
turning
the
right
flank
of
the
british
and
gaining
their
rear
to
prevent
this
calamity
burgoyne
effected
during
the
night
an
entire
change
of
position
with
great
skill
he
removed
his
whole
army
to
some
heights
near
the
river
a
little
northward
of
the
former
camp
and
he
there
drew
up
his
men
expecting
to
be
attacked
on
the
following
day
but
gates
was
resolved
not
to
risk
the
certain
triumph
which
his
success
had
already
secured
for
him
he
harassed
the
english
with
skirmishes
but
attempted
no
regular
attack
meanwhile
he
detached
bodies
of
troops
on
both
sides
of
the
hudson
to
prevent
the
british
from
recrossing
that
river
and
to
bar
their
retreat
when
night
fell
it
became
absolutely
necessary
for
burgoyne
to
retire
again
and
accordingly
the
troops
were
marched
through
a
stormy
and
rainy
night
towards
saratoga
abandoning
their
sick
and
wounded
and
the
greater
part
of
their
baggage
to
the
enemy
before
the
quitted
the
camp
the
last
sad
honours
were
paid
to
the
brave
general
fraser
who
expired
on
the
day
after
the
action
he
had
almost
with
his
last
breath
expressed
a
wish
to
be
buried
in
the
redoubt
which
had
formed
the
part
of
the
british
lines
where
he
had
been
stationed
but
which
had
now
been
abandoned
by
the
english
and
was
within
full
range
of
the
cannon
which
the
advancing
americans
were
rapidly
placing
in
position
to
bear
upon
burgoyne
force
burgoyne
resolved
nevertheless
to
comply
with
the
dying
wish
of
his
comrade
and
the
interment
took
place
under
circumstances
the
most
affecting
that
have
ever
marked
a
soldier
funeral
still
more
interesting
is
the
narrative
of
lady
ackland
passage
from
the
british
to
the
american
camp
after
the
battle
to
share
the
captivity
and
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
her
husband
who
had
been
severely
wounded
and
left
in
the
enemy
power
the
american
historian
lossing
has
described
both
these
touching
episodes
of
the
campaign
in
a
spirit
that
does
honour
to
the
writer
as
well
as
to
his
subject
after
narrating
the
death
of
general
fraser
on
the
of
october
he
says
that
it
was
just
at
sunset
on
that
calm
october
evening
that
the
corpse
of
general
fraser
was
carried
up
the
hill
to
the
place
of
burial
within
the
redoubt
it
was
attended
only
by
the
military
members
of
his
family
and
brudenell
the
chaplain
yet
the
eyes
of
hundreds
of
both
armies
followed
the
solemn
procession
while
the
americans
ignorant
of
its
true
character
kept
up
a
constant
cannonade
upon
the
redoubt
the
chaplain
unawed
by
the
danger
to
which
he
was
exposed
as
the
that
struck
the
hill
threw
the
loose
soil
over
him
pronounced
the
impressive
funeral
service
of
the
church
of
england
with
an
unfaltering
voice
the
growing
darkness
added
solemnity
to
the
scene
suddenly
the
irregular
firing
ceased
and
the
solemn
voice
of
a
single
cannon
at
measured
intervals
boomed
along
the
valley
and
awakened
the
responses
of
the
hills
it
was
a
minute
gun
fired
by
the
americans
in
honour
of
the
gallant
dead
the
moment
the
information
was
given
that
the
gathering
at
the
redoubt
was
a
funeral
company
fulfilling
at
imminent
peril
the
wishes
of
the
noble
fraser
orders
were
issued
to
withhold
the
cannonade
with
balls
and
to
render
military
homage
to
the
fallen
brave
the
case
of
major
ackland
and
his
heroic
wife
presents
kindred
features
he
belonged
to
the
grenadiers
and
was
an
accomplished
soldier
his
wife
accompanied
him
to
canada
in
and
during
the
whole
campaign
of
that
year
and
until
his
return
to
england
after
the
surrender
of
burgoyne
in
the
autumn
of
endured
all
the
hardships
dangers
and
privations
of
an
active
campaign
in
an
enemy
country
at
chambly
on
the
sorel
she
attended
him
in
illness
in
a
miserable
hut
and
when
he
was
wounded
in
the
battle
of
hubbardton
vermont
she
hastened
to
him
at
henesborough
from
montreal
where
she
had
been
persuaded
to
remain
and
resolved
to
follow
the
army
hereafter
just
before
crossing
the
hudson
she
and
her
husband
had
had
a
narrow
escape
from
losing
their
lives
in
consequence
of
their
tent
accidentally
taking
fire
during
the
terrible
engagement
of
the
october
she
heard
all
the
tumult
and
dreadful
thunder
of
the
battle
in
which
her
husband
was
engaged
and
when
on
the
morning
of
the
the
british
fell
back
in
confusion
to
their
new
position
she
with
the
other
women
was
obliged
to
take
refuge
among
the
dead
and
dying
for
the
tents
were
all
struck
and
hardly
a
shed
was
left
standing
her
husband
was
wounded
and
a
prisoner
in
the
american
camp
that
gallant
officer
was
shot
through
both
legs
when
poor
and
learned
troops
assaulted
the
grenadiers
and
artillery
on
the
british
left
on
the
afternoon
of
the
wilkinson
gates
while
pursuing
the
flying
enemy
when
they
abandoned
their
battery
heard
a
feeble
voice
exclaim
me
sir
against
that
boy
he
turned
and
saw
a
lad
with
a
musket
taking
deliberate
aim
at
a
wounded
british
officer
lying
in
a
corner
of
a
low
fence
wilkinson
ordered
the
boy
to
desist
and
discovered
the
wounded
man
to
be
major
ackland
he
had
him
conveyed
to
the
quarters
of
general
poor
now
the
residence
of
neilson
on
the
heights
where
every
attention
was
paid
to
his
wants
when
the
intelligence
that
he
was
wounded
and
a
prisoner
reached
his
wife
she
was
greatly
distressed
and
by
the
advice
of
her
friend
baron
reidesel
resolved
to
visit
the
american
camp
and
implore
the
favour
of
a
personal
attendance
upon
her
husband
on
the
she
sent
a
message
to
burgoyne
by
lord
petersham
his
asking
permission
to
depart
i
was
ready
to
believe
says
burgoyne
patience
and
fortitude
in
a
supreme
degree
were
to
be
found
as
well
as
every
other
virtue
under
the
most
tender
forms
i
was
astonished
at
this
proposal
after
so
long
an
agitation
of
spirits
exhausted
not
only
for
want
of
rest
but
absolutely
want
of
food
drenched
in
rain
for
twelve
hours
together
that
a
woman
should
be
capable
of
such
an
undertaking
as
delivering
herself
to
an
enemy
probably
in
the
night
and
uncertain
of
what
hands
she
might
fall
into
appeared
an
effort
above
human
nature
the
assistance
i
was
able
to
give
was
small
indeed
i
had
not
even
a
cup
of
wine
to
offer
her
all
i
could
furnish
her
with
was
an
open
boat
and
a
few
lines
written
upon
dirty
wet
paper
to
general
gates
recommending
her
to
his
protection
the
following
is
a
copy
of
the
note
sent
by
burgoyne
to
general
gates
lady
harriet
ackland
a
lady
of
the
first
distinction
of
family
rank
and
personal
virtues
is
under
such
concern
on
account
of
major
ackland
her
husband
wounded
and
a
prisoner
in
your
hands
that
i
can
not
refuse
her
request
to
commit
her
to
your
protection
whatever
general
impropriety
there
may
be
in
persons
of
my
situation
and
yours
to
solicit
favours
i
can
not
see
the
uncommon
perseverance
in
every
female
grace
and
the
exaltation
of
character
of
this
lady
and
her
very
hard
fortune
without
testifying
that
your
attentions
to
her
will
lay
me
under
obligations
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant

set
out
in

boat
upon

by

her
waiting
maid
and
her
husband

who
had
been
severely
wounded
while
searching
for
his
master
upon
the
it
was
about
sunset
when
they
started
and
a
violent
storm
of
rain
and
wind
which
had
been
increasing
since
the
morning
rendered
the
voyage
tedious
and
perilous
in
the
extreme
it
was
long
after
dark
when
they
reached
the
american
the
sentinel
heard
their
oars
and
hailed
them
lady
harriet
returned
the
answer
herself
the
clear
silvery
tones
of
a
woman
voice
amid
the
darkness
filled
the
soldier
on
duty
with
superstitious
fear
and
he
called
a
comrade
to
accompany
him
to
the
river
bank
the
errand
of
the
voyagers
was
made
known
but
the
faithful
guard
apprehensive
of
treachery
would
not
allow
them
to
laud
until
they
sent
for
major
dearborn
they
were
invited
by
that
officer
to
his
quarters
where
every
attention
was
paid
to
them
and
lady
harriet
was
comforted
by
the
joyful
tidings
that
her
husband
was
safe
in
the
morning
she
experienced
parental
tenderness
from
general
gates
who
sent
her
to
her
husband
at
poor
quarters
under
a
suitable
escort
there
she
remained
until
he
was
removed
to
albany
burgoyne
now
took
up
his
last
position
on
the
heights
near
saratoga
and
hemmed
in
by
the
enemy
who
refused
any
encounter
and
baffled
in
all
his
attempts
at
finding
a
path
of
escape
he
there
lingered
until
famine
compelled
him
to
capitulate
the
fortitude
of
the
british
army
during
this
melancholy
period
has
been
justly
eulogised
by
many
native
historians
but
i
prefer
quoting
the
testimony
of
a
foreign
writer
as
free
from
all
possibility
of
partiality
botta
says
botta
book
viii
it
exceeds
the
power
of
words
to
describe
the
pitiable
condition
to
which
the
british
army
was
now
reduced
the
troops
were
worn
down
by
a
series
of
toil
privation
sickness
and
desperate
fighting
they
were
abandoned
by
the
indians
and
canadians
and
the
effective
force
of
the
whole
army
was
now
diminished
by
repeated
and
heavy
losses
which
had
principally
fallen
on
the
best
soldiers
and
the
most
distinguished
officers
from
ten
thousand
combatants
to
less
than
that
number
of
this
remnant
little
more
than
three
thousand
were
english
in
these
circumstances
and
thus
weakened
they
were
invested
by
an
army
of
four
times
their
own
number
whose
position
extended
three
parts
of
a
circle
round
them
who
refused
to
fight
them
as
knowing
their
weakness
and
who
from
the
nature
of
the
ground
could
not
be
attacked
in
any
part
in
this
helpless
condition
obliged
to
be
constantly
under
arms
while
the
enemy
cannon
played
on
every
part
of
their
camp
and
even
the
american
whistled
in
many
parts
of
the
lines
the
troops
of
burgoyne
retained
their
customary
firmness
and
while
sinking
under
a
hard
necessity
they
showed
themselves
worthy
of
a
better
fate
they
could
not
be
reproached
with
an
action
or
a
word
which
betrayed
a
want
of
temper
or
of
fortitude
at
length
the
of
october
arrived
and
as
no
prospect
of
assistance
appeared
and
the
provisions
were
nearly
exhausted
burgoyne
by
the
unanimous
advice
of
a
council
of
war
sent
a
messenger
to
the
american
camp
to
treat
of
a
convention
general
gates
in
the
first
instance
demanded
that
the
royal
army
should
surrender
prisoners
of
war
he
also
proposed
that
the
british
should
ground
their
arms
burgoyne
replied
this
article
is
inadmissible
in
every
extremity
sooner
than
this
army
will
consent
to
ground
their
arms
in
their
encampment
they
will
rush
on
the
enemy
determined
to
take
no
quarter
after
various
messages
a
convention
for
the
surrender
of
the
army
was
settled
which
provided
that
the
troops
under
general
burgoyne
were
to
march
out
of
their
camp
with
the
honours
of
war
and
the
artillery
of
the
intrenchments
to
the
verge
of
the

from

to

upon

of
not

again
in

america
during
the
present
contest
the
articles
of
capitulation
were
settled
on
the
of
october
and
on
that
very
evening
a
messenger
arrived
from
clinton
with
an
account
of
his
successes
and
with
the
tidings
that
part
of
his
force
had
penetrated
as
far
as
esopus
within
fifty
miles
of
burgoyne
camp
but
it
was
too
late
the
public
faith
was
pledged
and
the
army
was
indeed
too
debilitated
by
fatigue
and
hunger
to
resist
an
attack
if
made
and
gates
certainly
would
have
made
it
if
the
convention
had
been
broken
off
accordingly
on
the
the
convention
of
saratoga
was
carried
into
effect
by
this
convention
men
surrendered
themselves
as
prisoners
the
sick
and
wounded
left
in
the
camp
when
the
british
retreated
to
saratoga
together
with
the
numbers
of
the
british
german
and
canadian
troops
who
were
killed
wounded
or
taken
and
who
had
deserted
in
the
preceding
part
of
the
expedition
were
reckoned
to
be
the
british
sick
and
wounded
who
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
americans
after
the
battle
of
the
were
treated
with
exemplary
humanity
and
when
the
convention
was
executed
general
gates
showed
a
noble
delicacy
of
feeling
which
deserves
the
highest
degree
of
honour
every
circumstance
was
avoided
which
could
give
the
appearance
of
triumph
the
american
troops
remained
within
their
lines
until
the
british
had
piled
their
arms
and
when
this
was
done
the
vanquished
officers
and
soldiers
were
received
with
friendly
kindness
by
their
victors
and
their
immediate
wants
were
promptly
and
liberally
supplied
discussions
and
disputes
afterwards
arose
as
to
some
of
the
terms
of
the
convention
and
the
american
congress
refused
for
a
long
time
to
carry
into
effect
the
article
which
provided
for
the
return
of
burgoyne
men
to
europe
but
no
blame
was
imputable
to
general
gates
or
his
army
who
showed
themselves
to
be
generous
as
they
had
proved
themselves
to
be
brave
gates
after
the
victory
immediately
despatched
colonel
wilkinson
to
carry
the
happy
tidings
to
congress
on
being
introduced
into
the
hall
he
said
the
whole
british
army
has
laid
down
its
arms
at
saratoga
our
own
full
of
vigour
and
courage
expect
your
order
it
is
for
your
wisdom
to
decide
where
the
country
may
still
have
need
for
their
service
honours
and
rewards
were
liberally
voted
by
the
congress
to
their
conquering
general
and
his
men
and
it
would
be
difficult
says
the
italian
historian
to
describe
the
transports
of
joy
which
the
news
of
this
event
excited
among
the
americans
they
began
to
flatter
themselves
with
a
still
more
happy
future
no
one
any
longer
felt
any
doubt
about
their
achieving
their
independence
all
hoped
and
with
good
reason
that
a
success
of
this
importance
would
at
length
determine
france
and
the
other
european
powers
that
waited
for
her
example
to
declare
themselves
in
favour
of
america
there
could
no
longer
be
any
question
respecting
the
future
since
there
was
no
longer
the
risk
of
espousing
the
cause
of
a
people
too
feeble
to
defend
themselves
the
truth
of
this
was
soon
displayed
in
the
conduct
of
france
when
the
news
arrived
at
paris
of
the
capture
of
ticonderoga
and
of
the
victorious
march
of
burgoyne
towards
albany
events
which
seemed
decisive
in
favour
of
the
english
instructions
had
been
immediately
despatched
to
nantz
and
the
other
ports
of
the
kingdom
that
no
american
privateers
should
be
suffered
to
enter
them
except
from
indispensable
necessity
as
to
repair
their
vessels
to
obtain
provisions
or
to
escape
the
perils
of
the
sea
the
american
commissioners
at
paris
in
their
disgust
and
despair
had
almost
broken
off
all
negotiations
with
the
french
government
and
they
even
endeavoured
to
open
communications
with
the
british
ministry
but
the
british
government
elated
with
the
first
successes
of
burgoyne
refused
to
listen
to
any
overtures
for
accommodation
but
when
the
news
of
saratoga
reached
paris
the
whole
scene
was
changed
franklin
and
his
brother
commissioners
found
all
their
difficulties
with
the
french
government
vanish
the
time
seemed
to
have
arrived
for
the
house
of
bourbon
to
take
a
full
revenge
for
all
its
humiliations
and
losses
in
previous
wars
in
december
a
treaty
was
arranged
and
formally
signed
in
the
february
following
by
which
france
acknowledged
the
independent
united
states
of
america
this
was
of
course
tantamount
to
a
declaration
of
war
with
england
spain
soon
followed
france
and
before
long
holland
took
the
same
course
largely
aided
by
french
fleets
and

the
americans
vigorously
maintained
the
war
against
the
armies
which
england
in
spite
of
her
european
foes
continued
to
send
across
the
atlantic
but
the
struggle
was
too
unequal
to
be
maintained
by
this
country
for
many
years
and
when
the
treaties
of
restored
peace
to
the
world
the

of
the

was
reluctantly

in

itself
dying
in
extreme
old
age
in
the
last
wish
of
the
veteran
on
his

was
that
his
heart
should
be
deposited
in
the
of

there
to
repose
among
the
remains
of
his
old
companions
in
arms
who
had
fallen
at
his
side
on
that
spot
years
before
on
the
memorable
day
when
they
won
the
primal
victory
of
revolutionary
france
and
prevented
the
armies
of
brunswick
and
the
emigrant
bands
of
conde
from
marching
on

destroying

immature

cradle
the
duke
of

for
kellerman
when
made
one
of
military
peers
in
took
his
title
from
this
same
battlefield
had
participated
during
his
long
and
active
career
in
the
gaining
of
many
a
victory
far
more
immediately
dazzling
than
the
the
one
the
remembrance
of
which
he
thus
cherished
he
had
been
present
at
many
a
scene
of
carnage
where
blood
flowed
in
deluges
compared
with
which
the
libations
of
slaughter
poured
out
at
valmy
would
have
seemed
scant
and
insignificant
but
he
rightly
estimated
the
paramount
importance
of
the
battle
with
which
he
thus
wished
his
appellation
while
living
and
his
memory
after
his
death
to
be
identified
the
successful
resistance
which
the
new
carmagnole
levies
and
the
disorganized
relics
of
the
old
monarchy
army
then
opposed
to
the
combined
hosts
and
chosen
leaders
of
prussia
austria
and
the
french
refugee
noblesse
determined
at
once
and
for
ever
the
belligerent
character
of
the
revolution
the
raw
artisans
and
tradesmen
the
clumsy
burghers
the
base
mechanics
and
low
peasant
churls
as
it
had
been
the
fashion
to
term
the
middle
and
lower
classes
in
france
found
that
they
could
face
pull
triggers
and
cross
bayonets
without
having
been
drilled
into
military
machines
and
without
being
officered
by
scions
of
noble
houses
they
awoke
to
the
consciousness
of
their
own
instinctive
soldiership
they
at
once
acquired
confidence
in
themselves
and
in
each
other
and
that
confidence
soon
grew
into
a
spirit
of
unbounded
audacity
and
ambition
from
the
cannonade
of
valmy
may
be
dated
the
commencement
of
that
career
of
victory
which
carried
their
armies
to
vienna
and
the
kremlin
alison
one
of
the
gravest
reflections
that
arises
from
the
contemplation
of
the
civil
restlessness
and
military
enthusiasm
which
the
close
of
the
last
century
saw
nationalised
in
france
is
the
consideration
that
these
disturbing
influences
have
become
perpetual
no
settled
system
of
government
that
shall
endure
from
generation
to
generation
that
shall
be
proof
against
corruption
and
popular
violence
seems
capable
of
taking
root
among
the
french
and
every
revolutionary
movement
in
paris
thrills
throughout
the
rest
of
the
world
even
the
successes
which
the
powers
allied
against
france
gained
in
and
important
as
they
were
could
not
annul
the
effects
of
the
preceding
years
of
general
convulsion
and
war
in
the
dynasty
which
foreign
bayonets
had
imposed
on
france
was
shaken
off
and
men
trembled
at
the
expected
outbreak
of
french
anarchy
and
the
dreaded
inroads
of
french
ambition
they
looked
forward
with
harassing
anxiety
to
a
period
of
destruction
similar
to
that
which
the

experienced

beneath

at

by

the

the
armed

became
the
commonplaces
of
recent
european
history
france
now
calls
herself
a
republic
she
first
assumed
that
title
on
the
of
september
on
the
very
day
on
which
the
battle
of
valmy
was
fought
and
won
to
that
battle
the
democratic
spirit
which
in
as
well
as
in
proclaimed
the
republic
in
paris
owed
its
preservation
and
it
is
thence
that
the
imperishable
activity
of
its
principles
may
be
dated
far
different
seemed
the
prospects
of
democracy
in
europe
on
the
eve
of
that
battle
and
far
different
would
have
been
the
present
position
and
influence
of
the
french
nation
if
brunswick
columns
had
charged
with
more
boldness
or
the
lines
of
dumouriez
resisted
with
less
firmness
when
france
in
declared
war
with
the
great
powers
of
europe
she
was
far
from
possessing
that
splendid
military
organization
which
the
experience
of
a
few
revolutionary
campaigns
taught
her
to
assume
and
which
she
has
never
abandoned
the
army
of
the
old
monarchy
had
during
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
sunk
into
gradual
decay
both
in
numerical
force
and
in
efficiency
of
equipment
and
spirit
the
laurels
gained
by
the
auxiliary
regiments
which
louis
xvi
sent
to
the
american
war
did
but
little
to
restore
the
general
tone
of
the
army
the
insubordination
and
licence
which
the
revolt
of
the
french
guards
and
the
participation
of
other
troops
in
many
of
the
first
excesses
of
the
revolution
introduced
among
the
soldiery
were
soon
rapidly
disseminated
through
all
the
ranks
under
the
legislative
assembly
every
complaint
of
the
soldier
against
his
officer
however
frivolous
or
was
listened
to
with
eagerness
and
investigated
with
partiality
on
the
principles
of
liberty
and
equality
discipline
accordingly
became
more
and
more
relaxed
and
the
dissolution
of
several
of
the
old
corps
under
the
pretext
of
their
being
tainted
with
an
aristocratic
feeling
aggravated
the
confusion
and
inefficiency
of
the
war
department
many
of
the
most
effective
regiments
during
the
last
period
of
the
monarchy
had
consisted
of
foreigners
these
had
either
been
slaughtered
in
defence
of
the
throne
against
insurrections
like
the
swiss
or
had
been
disbanded
and
had
crossed
the
frontier
to
recruit
the
forces
which
were
assembling
for
the
invasion
of
france
above
all
the
emigration
of
the
noblesse
had
stripped
the
french
army
of
nearly
all
its
officers
of
high
rank
and
of
the
greatest
portion
of
its
subalterns
more
than
twelve
thousand
of
the
youth
of
france
who
had
been
trained
to
regard
military
command
as
their
exclusive
patrimony
and
to
whom
the
nation
had
been
accustomed
to
look
up
as
its
natural
guides
and
champions
in
the
storm
of
war
were
now
marshalled
beneath
the
banner
of
conde
and
the
other
emigrant
princes
for
the
overthrow
of
the
french
armies
and
the
reduction
of
the
french
capital
their
successors
in
the
french
regiments
and
brigades
had
as
yet
acquired
neither
skill
nor
experience
they
possessed
neither
nor
the
respect
of
the
men
who
were
under
them
such
was
the
state
of
the
wrecks
of
the
old
army
but
the
bulk
of
the
forces
with
which
france
began
the
war
consisted
of
raw
insurrectionary
levies
which
were
even
less
to
be
depended
on
the
carmagnoles
as
the
revolutionary
volunteers
were
called
flocked
indeed
readily
to
the
frontier
from
every
department
when
the
war
was
proclaimed
and
the
fierce
leaders
of
the
jacobins
shouted
that
the
country
was
in
danger
they
were
full
of
zeal
and
courage
heated
and
excited
by
the
scenes
of
the
revolution
and
inflamed
by
the
florid
eloquence
the
songs
dances
and
with
which
it
had
been
celebrated
scott
life
of
napoleon
vol
i
c
viii
but
they
were
utterly
undisciplined
and
turbulently
impatient
of
superior
authority
or
systematical
control
many
ruffians
also
who
were
sullied
with
participation
in
the
most
sanguinary
horrors
of
paris
joined
the
camps
and
were
alike
for
misconduct
before
the
enemy
and
for
savage
insubordination
against
their
own
officers
on
one
occasion
during
the
campaign
of
valmy
eight
battalions
of
federates
intoxicated
with
massacre
and
sedition
joined
the
forces
under
dumouriez
and
soon
threatened
to
uproot
all
discipline
saying
openly
that
the
ancient
officers
were
traitors
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
purge
the
army
as
they
had
paris
of
its
aristocrats
dumouriez
posted
these
battalions
apart
from
the
others
placed
a
strong
force
of
cavalry
behind
them
and
two
pieces
of
cannon
on
their
flank

affecting
to

at
the

of

process

their
transmutation

commenced
the

disastrous
and
disgraceful
to
france

conquest
of

of

but
the
first
flash
of
an
austrian
sabre
or
the
first
sound
of

was
enough
to
discomfit
the
french
their

that
advanced
from

came
suddenly
upon
a
far
inferior

austrian
garrison
of

not
a
shot
was
fired
not
a
bayonet
levelled
with
one
simultaneous
cry
of
panic
the
french
broke
and
ran
headlong
back
to
lille
where
they
completed
the
specimen
of
insubordination
which
they
had
given
in
the
field
by
murdering
their
general
and
several
of
their
chief
officers
on
the

day
another
division
under

mustering
ten
thousand

scarcely

received

only
a

similar

equally
discreditable
occurred

earliest
french
generals
in

brought
their

into

meanwhile
the

sovereigns
had
gradually
collected
on

a
veteran
and
army
for
the
invasion
of
france
which
for
numbers
equipment
and
martial
renown
both
of

was
equal
to
any
that
germany
had
ever
sent
forth

to

boldly

decisively
at
the

penetrating
the

through
the
ardennes
to
proceed
by
chalons
upon

the
obstacles
that
lay
in
their
way
seemed
insignificant
the
disorder
and
imbecility
of
the
french
armies
had
been
even
augmented
by
the
forced
flight
of
la

and
a
sudden
change
of
generals
the
only
troops
posted
on

near
the
track
by
which
the

were
about
to

were
the

thousand
near

the
command
of
which
had
just
been
transferred
from

there
were

and
when
once
these
feeble

were
overcome
and

seemed
to
invite

the

nature

still
offered
to
brave
and
vigorous
defenders
of
the
land
the
means
of
opposing
a
barrier
to
the
progress
of
the
allies
a
ridge
of
broken
ground
called
the
argonne
extends
from
the
vicinity
of
sedan
towards
the
for
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
leagues
the
country
of
has
now
been
cleared
and
drained
but
in
it
was
thickly
wooded
and
the
lower
portions
of
its
unequal
surface
were
filled
with
rivulets
and
marshes
it
thus
presented
a
natural
barrier
of
from
four
to
five
leagues
broad
which
was
absolutely
impenetrable
to
an
army
except
by
a
few
defiles
such
as
an
inferior
force
might
easily
fortify
and
defend
dumouriez
succeeded
in
marching
his
army
down
from
sedan
behind
the
argonne
and
in
occupying
its
passes
while
the
prussians
still
lingered
on
the
side
of
the
forest
line
ordering
kellerman
to
wheel
round
from
metz
to
menehould
and
the
reinforcements
from
the
interior
and
extreme
north
also
to
concentrate
at
that
spot
dumouriez
trusted
to
assemble
a
powerful
force
in
the
rear
of
the
extremity
of
the
argonne
while
with
the
thousand
men
under
his
immediate
command
he
held
the
enemy
at
bay
before
the
passes
or
forced
him
to
a
long
circumvolution
round
one
extremity
of
the
forest
ridge
during
which
favourable
opportunities
of
assailing
his
flank
were
almost
certain
to
occur
dumouriez
fortified
the
principal
defiles
and
boasted
of
the
thermopylae
which
he
had
found
for
the
invaders
but
the
simile
was
nearly
rendered
fatally
complete
for
the
defending
force
a
pass
which
was
thought
of
inferior
importance
had
been
but
slightly
manned
and
an
austrian
corps
under
clairfayt
forced
it
after
some
sharp
fighting
dumouriez
with
great
difficulty
saved
himself
from
being
enveloped
and
destroyed
by
the
hostile
columns
that
now
pushed
through
the
forest
but
instead
of
despairing
at
the
failure
of
his
plans
and
falling
back
into
the
interior
to
be
completely
severed
from
kellerman
army
to
be
hunted
as
a
fugitive
under
the
walls
of
paris
by
the
victorious
germans
and
to
lose
all
chance
of
ever
rallying
his
dispirited
troops
he
resolved
to
cling
to
the
difficult
country
in
which
the
armies
still
were
grouped
to
force
a
junction
with
kellerman
and
so
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
a
force
which
the
invaders
would
not
dare
to
disregard
and
by
which
he
might
drag
them
back
from
the
advance
on
paris
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
bar
accordingly
by
a
rapid
movement
to
the
south
during
which
in
his
own
words
france
was
within
a
of
destruction
and
after
with
difficulty
checking
several
panics
of
his
troops
in
which
they
ran
by
thousands
at
the
sight
of
a
few
prussian
hussars
dumouriez
succeeded
in
establishing
his
in
a
strong
position
at
menehould
protected
by
the
marshes
and
shallows
of
the
river
aisne
and
aube
beyond
which
to
the
rose
a
firm
and
elevated
plateau
called

admirably
situated
for
commanding
the
road
by
chalons
to
paris
and
where
he
intended
to
post
kellerman
army
so
soon
as
it
came
up
some
late
writers
represent
that
brunswick
did
not
wish
to
check
dumouriez
there
is
no
sufficient
authority
for
this
insinuation
which
seems
to
have
been
first
prompted
by
a
desire
to
soothe
the
wounded
military
pride
of
the
prussians
the
news
of
the
retreat
of
dumouriez
from
the
argonne
passes
and
of
the
panic
flight
of
some
divisions
of
his
troops
spread
rapidly
throughout
the
country
and
kellerman
who
believed
that
his
comrade
army
had
been
annihilated
and
feared
to
fall
among
the
victorious
masses
of
the
prussians
had
halted
on
his
march
from
metz
when
almost
close
to
menehould
he
had
actually
commenced
a
retrograde
movement
when
couriers
from
his
checked
him
from
that
fatal
course
and
then
continuing
to
wheel
round
the
rear
and
left
flank
of
the
troops
at
menehould
kellerman
with
twenty
thousand
of
the
army
of
metz
and
some
thousands
of
volunteers
who
had
joined
him
in
the
march
made
his
appearance
to
the
west
of
dumouriez
on
the
very
evening
when
westerman
and
thouvenot
two
of
the
of
dumouriez
galloped
in
with
the
tidings
that
brunswick
army
had
come
through
the
upper
passes
of
the
argonne
in
full
force
and
was
deploying
on
the
heights
of
la
lune
a
chain
of
eminences
that
stretch
obliquely
from
to
opposite
the
high
ground
which
dumouriez
held
and
also
opposite
but
at
a
shorter
distance
from
the
position
which
kellerman
was
designed
to
occupy
the
allies
were
now
in
fact
nearer
to
paris
than
were
the
french
troops
themselves
but
as
dumouriez
had
foreseen
brunswick
deemed
it
unsafe
to
march
upon
the
capital
with
so
large
a
hostile
force
left
in
his
rear
between
his
advancing
columns
and
his
base
of
operations
the
young
king
of
prussia
who
was
in
the
allied
camp
and
the
emigrant
princes
eagerly
advocated
an
instant
attack
upon
the
nearest
french
general
kellerman
had
laid
himself
unnecessarily
open
by
advancing
beyond
dampierre
camp
which
dumouriez
had
designed
for
him
and
moving
forward
across
the
aube
to
the
plateau
of
valmy
a
post
inferior
in
strength
and
space
to
that
which
he
had
left
and
which
brought
him
close
upon
the
prussian
lines
leaving
him
separated
by
a
dangerous
interval
from
the
troops
under
dumouriez
himself
it
seemed
easy
for
the
prussian
army
to
overwhelm
him
while
thus
isolated
and
then
they
might
surround
and
crush
dumouriez
at
their
leisure
accordingly
the
right
wing
of
the
allied
army
moved
forward
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
of
the
of
september
to
gain
kellerman
left
flank
and
rear
and
cut
him
off
from
retreat
upon
chalons
while
the
rest
of
the
army
moving
from
the
heights
of
la
lune
which
here
converge
round
the
plateau
of
valmy
were
to
assail
his
position
in
front
and
interpose
between
him
and
dumouriez
an
unexpected
collision
between
some
of
the
advanced
cavalry

each
side
in
the
low
ground

of

dumouriez
had
not
been
unobservant
of
the
danger
of
his
comrade
thus
isolated
and
involved
and
he
had
ordered
up
troops
to
support
kellerman
on
either
flank
in
the
event
of
his
being
attacked
these
troops

the

glittering
in
the
early
light
about
ten
the
fog
began
to
clear
off
and
then
the
french
from
their
promontory
saw
emerging
from
the
white
wreaths
of
mist
and
glittering
in
the
sunshine
the
countless
prussian
cavalry
which
were
to

awe
however
bold
and
resolute
a
man
may
be
in
the
discharge
of
duty
it
is
an
anxious
and
fearful
thing
to
be
called
on
to
encounter
danger
among
comrades
of
whose
steadiness
you
can
feel
no
certainty
each
soldier
of
kellerman

must
have
remembered
the
series
of
panic
routs
which
had
hitherto
invariably
taken
place
on
the
french
side
during
the
war
and
must
have
cast
restless
glances
to
the
right
and
left
to
see
if
any
symptoms
of
wavering
began
to
show
themselves
and
to
calculate
how
long
it
was
likely
to
be
before
a
general
rush
of
his
comrades
to
the
rear
would
either
harry
him
off
with
involuntary
disgrace
or
leave
him
alone
and
helpless
to
be
cut
down
by
assailing
multitudes
on
that
very
morning
and
at
the
hour
in
which
the
allied
forces
and
the
emigrants
began
to
descend
from
la
lune
to
the
attack
of
valmy
and
while
the
cannonade
was
opening
between
the

and
the
revolutionary
batteries
the
debate
in
the
national
convention
at

on
the
proposal
to
proclaim

a
republic
the
old

little
chance
of
support
in
the
hall
of

but
if
its
more
effective
advocates
at
valmy
had
triumphed
there
were
yet
the
elements
existing
in
france
for
a
permanent
revival
of
the
better
part
of
the
ancient
institutions
and
for
substituting
reform
for
revolution
only
a
few
weeks
before
numerously
signed
addresses
from
the
middle
classes
in
paris
rouen
and
other
large
cities
had
been
presented
to
the
king
expressive
of
their
horror
of
the
anarchists
and
their
readiness
to
uphold
the
rights
of
the
crown
together
with
the
liberties
of
the
subject
and
an
armed
resistance
to
the
authority
of
the

and
in
favour
of
the

was
in
reality
at
this
time
being
actively
organized
in
la

brittany
the
importance
of
which
may
be
estimated
from
the
formidable
opposition
which
the
royalists
of
these
provinces
made
to
the
republican
party
at
a
later
period
and
under
much
more
disadvantageous
circumstances
it
is
a
fact
peculiarly
illustrative
of
the
importance
of
the
battle
of
valmy
that
during
the
summer
of
the
gentlemen
of
brittany
entered
into
an
extensive
association
for
the
purpose

been
imposed

marquis
de
la
rouarie
one
of
those
remarkable
men
who
rise
into
during
the
stormy
days
of
a
revolution
from
conscious
ability
to
direct
its
current
ardent
impetuous
and
enthusiastic
he
was
first
distinguished
in
the
american
war
when
the
intrepidity
of
his
conduct
attracted
the
admiration
of
the
republican
troops
and
the
same
qualities
rendered
him
at
first
an
ardent
supporter
of
the
revolution
in
france
but
when
the
atrocities
of
the
people
began
he
espoused
with
equal
warmth
the
opposite
side
and
used
the
utmost
efforts
to
rouse
the
noblesse
of
brittany
against
the
plebeian
yoke
which
had
been
imposed
upon
them
by
the
national
assembly
he
submitted
his
plan
to
the
count
and
had
organized
one
so
extensive
as
would
have
proved
extremely
formidable
to
the
convention
if
the
retreat
of
the
duke
of
brunswick
in
september
had
not
damped
the
ardour
of
the
whole
of
the
west
of
france
then
ready
to
break
out
into
insurrection
alison
vol
iii
p
and
it
was
not
only
among
the
zealots
of
the
old
monarchy
that
the
cause
of
the
king
would
then
have
found
friends
the
ineffable
atrocities
of
the
september
massacres
had
just
occurred
and
the
reaction
produced
by
them
among
thousands
who
had
previously
been
active
on
the
side
was
fresh
and
powerful
the
nobility
had
not
yet
been
made
utter
aliens
in
the
eyes
of
the
nation
by
long
expatriation
and
civil
war
there
was
not
yet
a
generation
of
youth
educated
in
revolutionary
principles
and
knowing
no
that
of
military
glory
louis
xvi
was
just
and
humane
and
deeply
sensible
of
the
necessity
of
a
gradual
extension
of
political
rights
among
all
classes
of
his
subjects
the
bourbon
throne
if
rescued
in
would
have
had
chances
of
stability
such
as
did
not
exist
for
it
in
and
seem
never
likely
to
be
found
again
in
france
serving
under
kellerman
on
that
day
was
one
who
experienced
perhaps
the
most
deeply
of
all
men
the
changes
for
good
and
for
evil
which
the
french
revolution
has
produced
he
who
in
his
second
exile
bore
the
name
of
the
count
de
neuilly
in
this
country
and
who
lately
was
louis
philippe
king
of
the
french
figured
in
the
french
lines
at
valmy
as
a
young
and
gallant
officer
cool
and
sagacious
beyond
his
years
and
trusted
accordingly
by
kellerman
and
dumouriez
with
an
important
station
in
the
national
army
the
duc
de
chartres
the
title
he
then
bore
commanded
the
french
right
general
valence
was
on
the
left
and
kellerman
himself
took
his
post
in
the
centre
which
was
the
strength
and
key
of
his
position
besides
these
celebrated
men
who
were
in
the
french
army
and
besides
the
king
of
prussia
the
duke
of
brunswick
and
other
men
of
rank
and
power
who
were
in
the
lines
of
the
allies
there
was
an
individual
present
at
the
battle
of
valmy
of
little
political
note
but
who
has
exercised
and
exercises
a
greater
influence
over
the
human
mind
and
whose
fame
is
more
widely
spread
than
that
of
either
duke
or
general
or
king
this
was
the
german
poet
goethe
who
had
out
of
curiosity
accompanied
the
allied
army
on
its
march
into
france
as
a
mere
spectator
he
has
given
us
a
curious
record
of
the
sensations
which
he
experienced
during
the
cannonade
it
must
be
remembered
that
many
thousands
in
the
french
ranks
then
like
goethe
felt
the
for
the
first
time
the
german
poet
says
campaign
in
france
in
farie
translation
i
had
heard
so
much
of
the
that
i
wanted
to
know
what
kind
of
thing
it
was
ennui
and
a
spirit
which
every
kind
of
danger
excites
to
daring
nay
even
to
rashness
induced
me
to
ride
up
quite
coolly
to
the
outwork
of
la
lune
this
was
again
occupied
by
our
people
but
it
presented
the
wildest
aspect
the
roofs
were
shot
to
pieces
the
scattered
about
the
bodies
of
men
mortally
wounded
stretched
upon
them
here
and
there
and
occasionally
a
spent
fell
and
rattled
among
the
ruins
of
the
the
roofs
quite
alone
and
left
to
myself
i
rode
away
on
the
heights
to
the
left
and
could
plainly
survey
the
favourable
position
of
the
french
they
were
standing
in
the
form
of
a
semicircle
in
the
greatest
quiet
and
security
kellerman
then
on
the
left
wing
being
the
easiest
to
reach
i
fell
in
with
good
company
on
the
way
officers
of
my
acquaintance
belonging
to
the
general
staff
and
the
regiment
greatly
surprised
to
find
me
here
they
wanted
to
take
me
back
again
with
them
but
i
spoke
to
them
of
particular
objects
i
had
in
view
and
they
left
me
without
further
dissuasion
to
my
singular
caprice
i
had
now
arrived
quite
in
the
region
where
the
balls
were
playing
across
me
the
sound
of
them
is
curious
enough
as
if
it
were
composed
of
the
humming
of
tops
the
gurgling
of
water
and
the
whistling
of
birds
they
were
less
dangerous
by
reason
of
the
wetness
of
the
ground
wherever
one
fell
it
stuck
fast
and
thus
my
foolish
experimental
ride
was
secured
against
the
danger
at
least
of
the
balls
rebounding
in
the
midst
of
these
circumstances
i
was
soon
able
to
remark
that
something
unusual
was
taking
place
within
me
i
paid
close
attention
to
it
and
still
the
sensation
can
be
described
only
by
similitude
it
appeared
as
if
you
were
in
some
extremely
hot
place
and
at
the
same
time
quite
penetrated
by
the
heat
of
it
so
that
you
feel
yourself
as
it
were
quite
one
with
the
element
in
which
you
are
the
eyes
lose
nothing
of
their
strength
or
clearness
but
it
is
as
if
the
world
had
a
kind
of
tint
which
makes
the
situation
as
well
as
the
surrounding
objects
more
impressive
i
was
unable
to
perceive
any
agitation
of
the
blood
but
everything
seemed
rather
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
glow
of
which
i
speak
from
this
then
it
is
clear
in
what
sense
this
condition
can
be
called
a
fever
it
is
remarkable
however
that
the
horrible
uneasy
feeling
arising
from
it
is
produced
in
us
solely
through
the
ears
for
the
the
howling
and
crashing
of
the
balls
through
the
air
is
the
real
cause
of
these
sensations
after
i
had
ridden
back
and
was
in
perfect
security
i
remarked
with
surprise
that
the
glow
was
completely
extinguished
and
not
the
slightest
feverish
agitation
was
left
behind
on
the
whole
this
condition
is
one
of
the
least
desirable
as
indeed
among
my
dear
and
noble
comrades
i
found
scarcely
one
who
expressed
a
really
passionate
desire
to
try
it
contrary
to
the
expectations
of
both
friends
and
foes
the
french
infantry
held
their
ground
steadily
under
the
fire
of
the
prussian
guns
which
thundered
on
them
from
la
lune
and
their
own
artillery
replied
with
equal
spirit
and
greater
effect
on
the
denser
masses
of
the
allied
army
thinking
that
the
prussians
were
slackening
in
their
fire
kellerman
formed
a
column
in
charging
order
and
dashed
down
into
the
valley
in
the
hopes
of
capturing
some
of
the
nearest
guns
of
the
enemy
a
masked
battery
opened
its
fire
on
the
french
column
and
drove
it
back
in
disorder
kellerman
having
his
horse
shot
under
him
and
being
with
difficulty
carried
off
by
his
men
the
prussian
columns
now
advanced
in
turn
the
french
artillerymen
began
to
waver
and
desert
their
posts
but
were
rallied
by
the
efforts
and
example
of
their
officers
and
kellerman
reorganizing
the
line
of
his
infantry
took
his
station
in
the
ranks
on
foot
and
called
out
to
his
men
to
let
the
enemy
come
close
up
and
then
to
charge
them
with
the
bayonet
the
troops
caught
the
enthusiasm
of
their
general
and
a
cheerful
shout
of
vive
la
nation
taken
by
one
battalion
from
another
pealed
across
the
valley
to
the
assailants
the
prussians
flinched
from
a
charge
against
a
force
that
seemed
so
resolute
and
formidable
they
halted
for
a
while
in
the
hollow
and
then
slowly
retreated
up
their
own
side
of
the
valley
indignant
at
being
thus
repulsed
by
such
a
foe
the
king
of
prussia
formed
the
flower
of
his
men
in
person
and
riding
along
the
column
bitterly
reproached
them
with
letting
their
standard
be
thus
humiliated
then
he
led
them
on
again
to
the
attack
marching
in
the
front
line
and
seeing
his
staff
mowed
down
around
him
by
the
deadly
fire
which
the
french
artillery
but
the
troops
sent
by
dumouriez
were
now
effectually
with
kellerman
and
that
general
own
men
flushed
by
success
presented
a
firmer
front
than
ever
again
the
prussians
retreated
leaving
eight
hundred
dead
behind
and
at
nightfall
the
french
remained
victors
on
the
heights
of
valmy
all
hopes
of
crushing
the
revolutionary
armies
and
of
the
promenade
to
paris
had
now
vanished
though
brunswick
lingered
long
in
the
argonne
till
distress
and
sickness
wasted
away
his
once
splendid
force
and
finally
but
a
mere
wreck
of
it
recrossed
the
frontier
france
meanwhile
felt
that
she
possessed
a
giant
strength
and
like
a
giant
did
she
use
it
before
the
close
of
that
year
all
belgium
obeyed
the
national
convention
at
paris
and
the
kings
of

the
lapse

observation
to
his
comrades
in
the
camp
of
the
allies
at
the
end
of
the
battle
deserves
citation
also
it
shows
that
the
poet
felt
and
probably
he
alone
of
the
thousands
there
assembled
felt
the
full
importance
of
that
day
he
describes
the
consternation
and
the
change
of
demeanour
which
he
observed
among
his
prussian
friends
that
evening
he
tells
us
that
most
of
them
were
silent

england
has
now
been
blest
with
years
of
peace
at
no
other
period
of
her
history
can
a
similarly
long
cessation
from
a
state
of
warfare
be
found
it
is
true
that
our
troops
have
had
battles
to
fight
during
this
interval
for
the
protection
and
extension
of
our
indian
possessions
and
our
colonies
but
these
have
been
with
distant
and
unimportant
enemies
the
danger
has
never
been
brought
near
our
own
shores
and
no
matter
of
vital
importance
to
our
empire
has
ever
been
at
stake
we
have
not
had
hostilities
with
either
france
america
or
russia
and
when
not
at
war
with
any
of
our
peers
we
feel
ourselves
to
be
substantially
at
peace
there
has
indeed
throughout
this
long
period
been
no
great
war
like
those
with
which
the
previous
history
of
modern
europe
abounds
there
have
been
formidable
collisions
between
particular
states
and
there
have
been
still
more
formidable
collisions
between
the
armed
champions
of
the
conflicting
principles
of
absolutism
and
democracy
but
there
has
been
no
general
war
like
those
of
the
french
revolution
like
the
american
or
the
seven
years
war
or
like
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
it
would
be
far
too
much
to
augur
from
this
that
no
similar
wars
will
again
convulse
the
world
but
the
value
of
the
period
of
peace
which
europe
has
gained
is
incalculable
even
if
we
look
on
it
as
only
a
truce
and
expect
again
to
see
the
nations
of
the
earth
recur
to
what
some
philosophers
have
termed
natural
state
of
warfare
no
equal
number
of
years
can
be
found
during
which
science
commerce
and
civilization
have
advanced
so
rapidly
and
so
extensively
as
has
been
the
case
since
when
we
trace
their
progress
especially
in
this
country
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
that
their
wondrous
development
has
been
mainly
due
to
the
land
having
been
at
peace
see
the
excellent
introduction
to
charles
knight
history
of
the
thirty
years
peace
their
good
effects
can
not
be
obliterated
even
if
a
series
of
wars
were
to
recommence
when
we
reflect
on
this
and
contrast
these
years
with
the
period
that
preceded
them
a
period
of
violence
of
tumult
of
unrestingly
destructive
energy
a
period
throughout
which
the
wealth
of
nations
was
scattered
like
sand
and
the
blood
of
nations
lavished
like
water
it
is
impossible
not
to
look
with
deep
interest
on
the
final
crisis
of
that
dark
and
dreadful
epoch
the
crisis
out
of
which
our

happier
cycle
of

has
been
evolved
the
great
battle
which
ended
the

war
of
the
first
french
revolution
and
which
quelled
the
man
whose
genius
and
ambition
had
so
long
disturbed
and
desolated
the
world
deserves
to
be
regarded
by
us
not
only
with
peculiar
pride
as
one
of
our
greatest
national
victories
but
with
peculiar
gratitude
for
the
repose
which
it
secured
for
us
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
human
race
one
good
test
for
determining
the
importance
of
waterloo
is
to
ascertain
what
was
felt
by
wise
and
prudent
statesmen
before
that
battle
respecting
the
return
of
napoleon
from
elba
to
the
imperial
throne
of
france
and
the
probable
effects
of
his
success
for
this
purpose
i
will
quote
the
words
not
of
any
of
our
vehement
politicians
of
the
school
of
pitt
but
of
a
leader
of
our
liberal
party
of
a
man
whose
reputation
as
a
jurist
a
historian
and
a
and
candid
statesman
was
and
is
deservedly
high
not
only
in
this
country
but
throughout
europe
sir
james
mackintosh
in
the
debate
in
the
british
house
of
commons
on
the
april
spoke
thus
of
the
return
from
elba
was
it
in
the
power
of
language
to
describe
the
evil
wars
which
had
raged
for
more
than
twenty
years
throughout
europe
which
had
spread
blood
and
desolation
from
cadiz
to
moscow
and
from
naples
to
copenhagen
which
had
wasted
the
means
of
human
enjoyment
and
destroyed
the
instruments
of
social
improvement
which
threatened
to
diffuse
among
the
european
nations
the
dissolute
and
ferocious
habits
of
a
predatory
soldiery
at
length
by
one
of
those
vicissitudes
which
bid
defiance
to
the
foresight
of
man
had
been
brought
to
a
close
upon
the
whole
happy
beyond
all
reasonable
expectation
with
no
violent
shock
to
national
independence
with
some
tolerable
compromise
between
the
opinions
of
the
age
and
reverence
due
to
ancient
institutions
with
no
too
signal
or
mortifying
triumph
over
the
legitimate
interests
or
avowable
feelings
of
any
numerous
body
of
men
and
above
all
without
those
retaliations
against
nations
or
parties
which
beget
new
convulsions
often
as
horrible
as
those
which
they
close
and
perpetuate
revenge
and
hatred
and
bloodshed

age

fair
prospect

consolatory
hopes

the

who
had
assembled
at

remodel
the

after
the
overthrow
of
the
mighty
conqueror
and
who
thought
that
napoleon
had
passed
away
for
ever
from
the
great
drama
of
european
politics
had
not
yet
completed
their
triumphant
festivities
and
their
diplomatic
toils
when
talleyrand
on
the
of
march
rose
up
among
them
and
announced
that
the

escaped
from
elba
and
was
emperor
of
france
once
more
it
is
recorded
by
sir
walter
scott
as
a
curious
physiological
fact
that
the
first
effect
of
the
news
of
an
event
which
threatened
to
neutralise
all
their
labours
was
to
excite
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
from
nearly
every
member
of
the
congress
life
of
napoleon
vol
viii
chap
but
the
jest
was
a
bitter
one
and
they
soon
were
deeply
busied
in
anxious
deliberations
respecting
the
mode
in
which
they
should
encounter
their
who
had
thus
started
from
torpor
and
obscurity

sought
to
disunite
the
formidable
confederacy
which
he
knew
would
be
arrayed
against
him
by
endeavouring
to
negotiate
separately
with
each
of
the
allied
sovereigns
it
is
said
that
austria
and
russia
were
at
first
not
unwilling
to
treat
with
him
disputes
and
jealousies
had
been
rife
among
several
of
the
allies
on
the
subject
of
the
division
of
the
conquered
countries
and
the
cordial
unanimity
with
which
they
had
acted
during
and
the
first
months
of
had
grown
chill
during
some
weeks
of
discussions
but
the
active
exertions
of
tralleyrand
who
represented
louis
xviii
at
the
congress
and
who
both
hated
and
feared
napoleon
with
all
the
intensity
of
which
his
powerful
spirit
was
capable
prevented
the
secession
of
any
member
of
the
congress
from
the
new
great
league
against
their
ancient
enemy
still
it
is
highly
probable
that
if
napoleon
had
triumphed
in
belgium
over
the
prussians
and
the
english
he
would
have
succeeded
in
opening
negotiations
with
the
austrians
and
russians
and
he
might
have
thus
gained
advantages
similar
to
those
which
he
had
obtained
on
his
return
from
egypt
when
he
induced
the
czar
paul
to
withdraw
the
russian
armies
from
with
the
other
enemies
of
france
in
the
extremity
of
peril
to
which
she
seemed
reduced
in

fortune
now
had
deserted

in
diplomacy
and
in
war
on
the
of
march
the
ministers
of
the
seven
powers
austria
spain
england
portugal
prussia
russia
and
sweden
signed
a
manifesto
by
which
they
declared
napoleon
an
outlaw
and
this
denunciation
was
instantly
followed
up
by
a
treaty
between
england
austria
prussia
and
russia
to
which
other
powers
soon
acceded
by
which
the
rulers
of
those
countries
bound
themselves
to
enforce
that
decree
and
to
prosecute
the
war
until
napoleon
should
be
driven
from
the
throne
of
france
and
rendered
incapable
of
disturbing
the
peace
of
europe
the
duke
of
wellington
was
the
representative
of
england
at
the
congress
of
vienna
and
he
was
immediately
applied
to
for
his
advice
on
the
plan
of
military
operations
against
france
it
was
obvious
that
belgium
would
be
the
first
and
by
the
general
wish
of
the
allies
the
english
duke
proceeded
thither
to
assemble
an
army
from
the
contingents
of
dutch
belgian
and
hanoverian
troops
that
were
most
speedily
available
and
from
the
english
regiments

was
hastening

strong

remained
there
since
the
campaign
of
the
preceding

largely
reinforced
by
other
troops
of
the
same
nation
and
marshal
blucher
the
favourite
hero
of
the
prussian
soldiery
and
the
deadliest
foe
of
france
assumed
the
command
of
this
army
which
was
termed
the
army
of
the
lower
rhine
and
which
in
conjunction
with
wellington
forces
was
to
make
the
van
of
the
armaments
of
the
allied
powers
meanwhile
prince
swartzenburg
was
to
collect
austrians
and
troops
of
other
germanic
states
as
the
army
of
the
upper
rhine
and
russians
under
the
command
of
barclay

tolly
were
to
form
the
army
of
the
middle
rhine
and
to
repeat

march

river

the
exertions
which
the
allied
powers
thus
made
at
this
crisis
to
grapple
promptly
with
the
french
emperor
have
truly
been
termed
gigantic
and
never
were
napoleon
genius
and
activity
more
signally
displayed
than
in
the
celerity
and
skill
by
which
he
brought
forward
all
the
military
resources
of
france

the
reverses
of
the
three
preceding
years
and
the
pacific
policy
of

the
triple
chain
of
strong
fortresses
which
the

possessed
on

a
curtain
behind

able
to
concentrate

to
conceal

last

precise
line
of
attack

of
severing
the

force
upon
that
city
the
duke
army
was
judiciously
arranged
so
as
to
enable
him
to
concentrate
troops
on
any
one
of
these
roads
sufficiently
in
advance
of
brussels
to
check
an
assailing
enemy
the
army
was
kept
thus
available
for
movement
in
any
necessary
direction
till
certain
intelligence
arrived
on
the
of
june
that
the
french
had
crossed
the
frontier
in
large
force
near
thuin
that
they
had
driven
back
the
prussian
advanced
troops
under
general
ziethen
and
were
also
moving
across
the
sambre
upon
charleroi
marshal
blucher
now
rapidly
concentrated
his
forces
calling
them
in
from
the
left
upon
ligny
which
is
to
the
of
charleroi
wellington
also
drew
his
troops
together
calling
them
in
from
the
right
but
even
now
though
it
was
certain
that
the
french
were
in
large
force
at
charleroi
it
was
unsafe
for
the
english
general
to
place
his
army
directly
between
that
place
and
brussels
until
it
was
certain
that
no
corps
of
the
enemy
was
marching
upon
brussels
by
the
western
road
through
mons
and
hal
the
duke
therefore
collected
his
troops
in
brussels
and
its
immediate
vicinity
ready
to
move
due
southward
upon
quatre
bras
and
with
blucher
who
was
taking
his
station
at
ligny
but
also
ready
to
meet
and
defeat
any
manoeuvre
that
the
enemy
might
make
to
turn
the
right
of
the
allies
and
occupy
brussels
by
a
flanking
movement
the
testimony
of
the
prussian
general
baron
muffling
who
was
attached
to
the
duke
staff
during
the
campaign
and
who
expressly
states
the
reasons
on
which
the
english
general
acted
ought
for
ever
to
have
silenced
the
weak
inventions
of
the
enemy
about
the
duke
of
wellington
having
been
deceived
and
surprised
by
his
assailant
which
some
writers
of
our
own
nation
as
well
as
foreigners
have
incautiously
repeated
see
passages
from
my
life
and
writings
by
baron
muffling
of
the
english
translation
edited
by
yorke
see
also
the
number
of
the
quarterly
it
is
strange
that
lamartine
should
after
the
appearance
of
muffling
work
have
repeated
in
his
history
of
the
restoration
the
myth
of
wellington
having
been
surprised
in
the
brussels
it
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
of
the
that
a
prussian
officer
reached
brussels
whom
general
ziethen
had
sent
to
muffling
to
inform
him
of
the
advance
of
the
main
french
army
upon
charleroi
muffling
immediately
communicated
this
to
the
duke
of
wellington
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
now
concentrate
his
army
and
what
would
be
his
point
of
concentration
observing
that
marshal
blucher
in
consequence
of
this
intelligence
would
certainly
concentrate
the
prussians
at
ligny
the
duke
replied
if
all
is
as
general
ziethen
supposes
i
will
concentrate
on
my
left
wing
and
so
be
in
readiness
to
fight
in
conjunction
with
the
prussian
army
should
however
a
portion
of
the
enemy
force
come
by
mons
i
must
concentrate
more
towards
my
centre
this
is
the
reason
why
i
must
wait
for
positive
news
from
mons
before
i
fix
the
rendezvous
since
however
it
is
certain
that
the
troops
must
march
though
it
is
uncertain
upon
what
precise
spot
they
must
march
i
will
order
all
to
be
in
readiness
and
will
direct
a
brigade
to
move
at
once
towards
quatre
bras
muffling
p
later
in
the
same
day
a
message
from
blucher
himself
was
delivered
to
muffling
in
which
the
prussian
informed
the
baron
that
he
was
concentrating
his
men
at
sombref
and
ligny
and
charged
muffling
to
give
him
speedy
intelligence
respecting
the
concentration
of
wellington
muffling
immediately
communicated
this
to
the
duke
who
expressed
his
satisfaction
with
blucher
arrangements
but
added
that
he
could
not
even
then
resolve
upon
his
own
point
of
concentration
before
he
obtained
the
desired
intelligence
from
mons
about
midnight
this
information
arrived
the
duke
went
to
the
quarters
of
general
muffling
and
told
him
that
he
now
had
received
his
reports
from
mons
and
was
sure
that
no
french
troops
were
advancing
by
that
route
but
that
the
mass
of
the
enemy
force
was
decidedly
directed
on
charleroi
he
informed
the
prussian
general
that
he
had
ordered
the
british
troops
to
move
forward
upon
quatre
bras
but
with
characteristic
coolness
and
sagacity
resolved
not
to
give
the
appearance
of
alarm
by
hurrying
on
with
them
himself
a
ball
was
to
be
given
by
the
duchess
of
richmond
at
brussels
that
night
and
the
duke
proposed
to
general
muffling
that
they
should
go
to
the
ball
for
a
few
hours
and
ride
forward
in
the
morning
to
overtake
the
troops
at
quatre
bras
to
hundreds
who
were
assembled
at
that
memorable
ball
the
news
that
the
enemy
was
advancing
and
that
the
time
for
battle
had
come
must
have
been
a
fearfully
exciting
surprise
and
the
magnificent
stanzas
of
byron
are
as
true
as
they
are
beautiful
but
the
duke
and
his
principal
officers
knew
well
the
stern
termination
to
that
festive
scene
which
was
approaching
one
by
one
and
in
such
a
way
as
to
attract
as
little
observation
as
possible
the
leaders
of
the
various
corps
left
the
and
took
their
stations
at
the
head
of
their
men
who
were
pressing
forward
through
the
last
hours
of
the
short
summer
night
to
the
arena
of
anticipated
slaughter
there
was
a
sound
of
revelry
by
night
and
belgium
capital
had
gather
then
her
beauty
and
her
chivalry
and
bright
the
lamps
shone
fair
women
and
brave
men
a
thousand
hearts
beat
happily
and
when
music
arose
with
its
voluptuous
swell
soft
eyes
look
love
to
eyes
which
spake
again
and
all
went
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
but
hush
hark
a
deep
sound
strikes
like
a
rising
knell
did
ye
not
hear
it
no
was
but
the
wind
or
the
car
rattling
the
stony
street
on
with
the
dance
let
joy
be
unconfined
no
sleep
till
morn
when
youth
and
pleasure
meet
to
chase
the
glowing
hours
with
flying
feet
but
hark
that
heavy
sound
breaks
in
once
more
as
if
the
clouds
its
echo
would
repeat
and
nearer
clearer
deadlier
than
before

it

is
the

that

he
did
hear
that
sound
the
first
amidst
the
festival
and
caught
its
tone
with
death
prophetic
ear
and
when
they
smiled
because
he
deem
it
near
his
heart
more
truly
knew
that
peal
too
well
which
stretch
his
father
on
a
bloody
bier
and
roused
the
vengeance
blood
alone
could
quell
he
rush
into
the
field
and
foremost
fighting
fell
ah
then
and
there
was
hurrying
to
and
fro
and
gathering
tears
and
tremblings
of
distress
and
cheeks
all
pale
which
but
an
hour
ago
blush
at
the
praise
of
their
own
loveliness
and
there
were
sudden
partings
such
as
press
the
life
from
out
young
hearts
and
choking
sighs
which
might
be
repeated
who
could
guess
if
ever
more
should
meet
those
mutual
eyes
since
upon
night
so
sweet
such
awful
morn
could
rise
and
there
was
mounting
in
hot
haste
the
steed
the
mustering
squadron
and
the
clattering
car
went
pouring
forward
with
impetuous
speed

swiftly
forming
in
the
ranks
of
war
and
the
deep
thunder
peal
on
peal
afar
and
near
the
beat
of
the
alarming
drum
roused
up
the
soldier
ere
the
morning
star
while
thronged
the
citizens
with
terror

the

in

so

morrow

the
troops

to
employ

beating
back

english
troops
as
might
advance
to
the
help
of

also
in
aiding
his
own
attack

gave
the

not
to
have
originally

to
employ
this
celebrated
general

night

of

lateness

the
hour
and
the
exhausted
state
of
the
french
troops
who
had
been
marching
and
fighting
since
ten
in
the
morning
made
him
pause
from
advancing
further
to
attack
the
much
more
important
position
of
quatre

in
truth
the
advantages
which
the
french
gained
by
their
almost
superhuman
energy
and
activity
throughout
the
long
day
of
the
of
june
were
necessarily
bought
at
the
price
of
more
delay
and
inertness
during
the
following
night
and
morrow
than
would
have
been
observable
if
they
had
not
been
thus
overtasked
ney
has
been
blamed
for
want
of
promptness
in
his
attack
upon
quatre
bras
and
napoleon
has
been
criticised
for
not
having
fought
at
ligny
before
the
afternoon
of
the
but
their
censors
should
remember
that
soldiers
are
but
men
and
that
there
must
be
necessarily
some
interval
of
time
before
troops
that
have
been
worn
and
weakened
by
twenty
hours
of
incessant
fatigue

strife

the
french
the

together
and
remained
in
earnest
conversation
till
two
in
the
morning
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
ney
rode
back
to
frasne
where
he
endeavoured
to
collect
tidings
of
the
numbers
and
movements
of
the
enemy
in
front
of
him
and
also
busied
himself
in
the
necessary
duty
of
learning
the
amount
and
composition
of
the
troops
which
he
himself
was
commanding
he
had
been
so
suddenly
appointed
to
his
high
station
that
he
did
not
know
the
strength
of
the
several
regiments
under
him
or
even
the
names
of
their
commanding
officers
he
now
caused
his
to
prepare
the
requisite
returns

drew
together

troops

he
was
thus
learning

he
used
them

about

of

very
cheerful
as

who
accompanied
him

muffling
p
at
five
the
duke
and
the
baron
were
on
horseback
and
reached
the
position
at
quatre
bras
about
eleven
as
the
french
who
were
in
front
of
frasne
were
perfectly
quiet
and
the
duke
was
informed
that
a
very
large
force
under
napoleon
in
person
was
menacing
blucher
it
was
thought
possible
that
only
a
slight
detachment
of
the
french
was
posted
at
frasne
in
order
to
mask
the
english
army
in
that
event
wellington
as
he
told
baron
muffling
would
be
able
to
employ
his
whole
strength
in
supporting
the
prussians
and
he
proposed
to
ride
across
from
quatre
bras
to
blucher
position
in
order
to
concert
with
him
personally
the
measures
which
should
be
taken
in
order
to
bring
on
a
decisive
battle
with
the
french
wellington
and
muffling
rode
accordingly
towards
ligny
and
found
marshal
blucher
and
his
staff
at
the
windmill
of
bry
near
that
village
the
prussian
army
strong
was
drawn
up
chiefly
along
a
chain
of
heights
with
the
villages
of
sombref
amand
and
ligny
in
their
front
these
villages
were
strongly
occupied
by
prussian
detachments
and
formed
the
keys
of
blucher
position
the
heads
of
the
columns
which
napoleon
was
forming
for
the
attack
were
visible
in
the
distance
the
duke
asked
blucher
and
general
gneisenau
who
was
blucher
adviser
in
matters
of
strategy
what
they
wished
him
to
do
muffling
had
already
explained
to
them
in
a
few
words
the
duke
earnest
desire
to
support
the
and
that
he
would
do
all
that
they
wished
provided
they
did
not
ask
him
to
divide
his
army
which
was
contrary
to
his
principles
the
duke
wished
to
advance
with
his
army
as
soon
as
it
was
concentrated
upon
frasne
and
gosselies
and
thence
to
move
upon
napoleon
flank
and
rear
the
prussian
leaders
preferred
that
he
should
march
his
men
from
quatre
bras
by
the
namur
road
so
as
to
form
a
reserve
in
rear
of
blucher
army
the
duke
replied
well
i
will
come
if
i
am
not
attacked
myself
and
galloped
back
with
muffling
to
quatre
bras
where
the
french
attack
was
now
actually
raging

ney
began
the
battle
about
two
in
the
afternoon

had
at
this
time
in
hand

and
guns
the
force
which
napoleon
nominally
placed
at
his
command
exceeded
men
but
more
than
one
half
of
these
consisted
of
the
first
french
corps
under
count
and
ney
was
deprived
of
the
use
of
this
corps
at
the
time
that
he
most
required
it
in
consequence
of
its
receiving
orders
to
march
to
the
aid
of
the
emperor
at
ligny
a
magnificent
body
of
heavy
cavalry
under
kellerman
nearly
strong
and
several
more
battalions
of
artillery
were
added
to
ney
army
during
the
battle
of
quatre
bras
but
his
effective
infantry
force
never
exceeded
when
the
battle
began
the
greater
part
of
the
duke

was
yet
on
its
march
towards
quatre
bras
from
brussels
and
the
other
parts
of
its
cantonments
the
force
of
the
allies
actually
in

there
consisted
only
of
a
dutch

quite
strong

inclosures
of

the
prince
of
orange
endeavoured
to
secure
these
posts
but
ney
carried
gemiancourt
in
the
centre
and
pierremont
on
the
east
and
gained
occupation
of
the
southern
part
of
the
wood
of

he
ranged
the
chief
part
of
his
artillery
on
the
high
ground
of
gemiancourt
whence
it
played
throughout
the
action
with
most
destructive
effect
upon
the
allies
he
was
pressing
forward
to
further
advantages
when
the
fifth
infantry
division
under
sir
thomas
picton
and
the
duke
of
brunswick
corps
appeared
upon
the
scene
wellington
who
had
returned
to
quatre
bras
from
his
interview
with
blucher
shortly
before
the
arrival
of
these
forces
restored
the
fight
with
them
and
as
fresh
troops
of
the
allies
arrived
they
were
brought
forward
to
stem
the
fierce
attacks
which
ney
columns
and
squadrons
continued
to
make
with
unabated
gallantry
and
zeal
the
only
cavalry
of
the
army
that
reached
quatre
bras
during
the
action
consisted
of
dutch
and
belgians
and
a
small
force
of
brunswickers
under
their
duke
who
was
killed
on
the
field
these
proved
wholly
unable
to
encounter
kellerman
cuirassiers
and
lancers
the
dutch
and
belgian
infantry
also
gave
way
early
in
the
engagement
so
that
the
whole
brunt
of
the
battle
fell
on
the
british
and
german
infantry
they
sustained
it
nobly
though
repeatedly
charged
by
the
french
cavalry
though
exposed
to
the
murderous
fire
of
the
french
batteries
which
from
the
heights
of
gemiancourt
sent
shot
and
shell
into
the
devoted
squares
whenever
the
french
horseman
withdrew
they
not
only
repelled
their
assailants
but
kempt
and
brigades
led
on
by
picton
actually
advanced
against
and
through
their
charging
foes
and
with
stern
determination
made
good
to
the
end
of
the
day
the
ground
which
they
had
thus
boldly
won
some
however
of
the
british
regiments
were
during
the
confusion
assailed
by
the
french
cavalry
before
they
could
form
squares
and
suffered
severely
one
regiment
the
was
almost
wholly
destroyed
by
the
cuirassiers
a
french
private
soldier
named
lami
of
the
regiment
of
cuirassiers
captured
one
of
the
english
colours
and
presented
it
to
ney
it
was
a
solitary
trophy
the
arrival
of
the
english
guards
about
six
enabled
the
duke
to
recover
the
wood
of
bossu
which
the
french
had
almost
entirely
won
and
the
possession
of
which
by
them
would
have
enabled
ney
to
operate
destructively
upon
the
allied
flank
and
rear
not
only
was
the
wood
of
bossu
recovered
on
the
british
right
but
the
inclosures
of
pierremont
were
also
carried
on
the
left
when
night
set
in
the
french
had
been
driven
back
on
all
points
towards
frasne
but
they
still
held
the
farm
of
gemiancourt
in
front
of
the
duke
centre
wellington
and
muffling
were
unacquainted
with
the
result
of
the
collateral
battle
between
blucher
and
napoleon
the
cannonading
of
which
had
been
distinctly
audible
at
quatre
bras
throughout
the
afternoon
and
evening
the
duke
observed
to
muffling
that
of
course
the
two
allied
armies
would
assume
the
offensive
against
the
enemy
on
the
morrow
and
consequently
it
would
be
better
to
capture
the
farm
at
once
instead
of
waiting
till
next
morning
muffling
agreed
in
the
duke
views
and
gemiancourt
was
forthwith
attacked
by
the
english
and
captured
with
little
loss
to
its
assailants
muffling
p
meanwhile
the
french
and
the
prussians
had
been
fighting
in
and
round
the
villages
of
ligny
sombref
and
armand
from
three
in
the
afternoon
to
nine
in
the
evening
with
a
savage
inveteracy
almost
unparalleled
in
modern
warfare
blucher
had
in
the
field
when
he
began
the
battle
men
and
guns
bulow
corps
which
was
strong
had
not
joined
him
but
the
hoped
to
be
reinforced
by
it
or
by
the
english
army
before
the
end
of
the
action
but
bulow
through
some
error
in
the
transmission
of
orders
was
far
in
the
rear
and
the
duke
of
wellington
was
engaged
as
we
have
seen
with
marshal
ney
blucher
received
early
warning
from
baron
muffling
that
the
duke
could
not
come
to
his
assistance
but
as
muffling
observes
wellington
rendered
the
prussians
the
great
service
of
occupying
more
than
of
the
enemy
who
otherwise
would
have
crushed
blucher
right
flank
for
not
only
did
the
conflict
at
quatre
bras
detain
the
french
troops
which
actually
took
part
in
it
but
received
orders
from
ney
to
join
him
which
hindered
from
giving
effectual
aid
to
napoleon
indeed
the
whole
of
corps
in
consequence
of
conflicting
directions
from
ney
and
the
emperor
marched
and
countermarched
during
the
between
quatre
bras
and
ligny
without
firing
a
shot
in
either
battle
blucher
had
in
fact
a
superiority
of
more
than
in
number
over
the
french
army
that
attacked
him
at
ligny
the
numerical
difference
was
even
greater
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
as
lobau
corps
did
not
come
up
from
charleroi
till
eight
after
five
hours
and
a
half
of
desperate
and
struggle
napoleon
succeeded
in
breaking
the
centre
of
the
prussian
line
at
ligny
and
in
forcing
his
obstinate
antagonists
off
the
field
of
battle
the
issue
was
attributable
to
his
skill
and
not
to
any
want
of
spirit
or
resolution
on
the
part
of
the
prussian
troops
nor
did
they
though
defeated
abate
one
jot
in
discipline
heart
or
hope
as
blucher
observed
it
was
a
battle
in
which
his
army
lost
the
day
but
not
its
honour
the
prussians
retreated
during
the
night
of
the
and
the
early
part
of
the
with
perfect
regularity
and
steadiness
the
retreat
was
directed
not
towards
maestricht
where
their
principal
depots
were
established
but
towards
wavre
so
as
to
be
able
to
maintain
their
communication
with
wellington
army
and
still
follow
out
the
original
plan
of
the
campaign
the
heroism
with
which
the
prussians
endured
and
repaired
their
defeat
at
ligny
is
more
glorious
than
many
victories
the
messenger
who
was
sent
to
inform
wellington
of
the
retreat
of
the
prussian
army
was
shot
on
the
way
and
it
was
not
until
the
morning
of
the
that
the
allies
at
quatre
bras
knew
the
result
of
the
battle
of
ligny
the
duke
was
ready
at
daybreak
to
take
the
offensive
against
the
enemy
with
vigour
his
whole
army
being
by
that
time
fully
assembled
but
on
learning
that
blucher
had
been
defeated
a
different
course
of
action
was
clearly
necessary
it
was
obvious
that
main
army
would
now
be
directed
against
wellington
and
a
retreat
was
inevitable
on
ascertaining
that
the
prussian
army
had
retired
upon
wavre
that
there
was
no
hot
pursuit
of
them
by
the
french
and
that
bulow
corps
had
taken
no
part
in
the
action
at
ligny
the
duke
resolved
to
march
his
army
back
towards
brussels
still
intending
to
cover
that
city
and
to
halt
at
a
point
in
a
line
with
wavre
and
there
restore
his
communication
with
blucher
an
officer
from
blucher
army
reached
the
duke
about
nine
from
whom
he
learned
the
effective
strength
that
blucher
still
possessed
and
how
little
discouraged
his
ally
was
by
the
yesterday
battle
wellington
sent
word
to
the
prussian
commander
that
he
would
halt
in
the
position
of
mont
jean
and
accept
a
general
battle
with
the
french
if
blucher
would
pledge
himself
to
come
to
his
assistance
with
a
single
corps
of
men
this
was
readily
promised
and
after
allowing
his
men
ample
time
for
rest
and
refreshment
wellington
retired
over
about
half
the
space
between
quatre
bras
and
brussels
he
was
pursued
but
little
molested
by
the
main
french
army
which
about
noon
of
the
moved
laterally
from
ligny
and
joined
ney
forces
which
had
advanced
through
quatre
bras
when
the
british
abandoned
that
position
the
earl
of
uxbridge
with
the
british
cavalry
covered
the
retreat
of
the
duke
army
with
great
skill
and
gallantry
and
a
heavy
thunderstorm
with
torrents
of
rain
impeded
the
operations
of
the
french
pursuing
squadrons
the
duke
still
expected
that
the
french
would
endeavour
to
turn
his
right
and
march
upon
brussels
by
the
high
road
that
leads
through
mons
and
hal
in
order
to
counteract
this
anticipated
manoeuvre
he
stationed
a
force
of
men
under
prince
frederick
of
the
netherlands
at
hal
with
orders
to
maintain
himself
there
if
attacked
as
long
as
possible
the
duke
halted
with
the
rest
of
his
army
at
the
position
near
mont
jean
which
from
a
village
in
its
neighbourhood
has
received
the
name
of
the
field
of
waterloo
wellington
was
now
about
twelve
miles
distant
on
a
line
running
from
west
to
east
from
wavre
where
the
prussian
army
had
now
been
completely
reorganised
and
collected
and
where
it
had
been
strengthened
by
the
junction
of
bulow
troops
which
had
taken
no
part
in
the
battle
of
ligny
blucher
sent
word
from
wavre
to
the
duke
that
he
was
coming
to
help
the
english
at
mont
jean
in
the
morning
not
with
one
corps
but
with
his
whole
army
the
fiery
old
man
only
stipulated
that
the
combined
armies
if
not
attacked
by
napoleon
on
the
should
themselves
attack
him
on
the
so
far
were
blucher
and
his
army
from
being
in
the
state
of
annihilation
described
in
the
boastful
bulletin
by
which
napoleon
informed
the
parisians
of
his
victory
at
ligny
indeed
the
french
emperor
seems
himself
to
have
been
misinformed
as
to
the
extent
of
loss
which
he
had
inflicted
on
the
prussians
had
he
known
in
what
good
order
and
with
what
undiminished
spirit
they
were
retiring
he
would
scarcely
have
delayed
sending
a
large
force
to
press
them
in
their
retreat
until
noon
on
the
such
however
was
the
case
it
was
about
that
time
that
he
confided
to
marshal
grouchy
the
duty
of
pursuing
the
defeated
prussians
and
preventing
them
from
joining
wellington
he
placed
for
this
purpose
men
and
guns
under
his
orders
violent
complaints
and
recriminations
passed
afterwards
between
the
emperor
and
the
marshal
respecting
the
manner
in
which
grouchy
attempted
to
perform
this
duty
and
the
reasons
why
he
failed
on
the
to
arrest
the
lateral
movement
of
the
prussians
from
wavre
to
waterloo
it
is
sufficient
to
remark
here
that
the
force
which
napoleon
gave
to
grouchy
though
the
utmost
that
the
emperor
limited
means
would
allow
was
insufficient
to
make
head
against
the
entire
prussian
army
especially
after
bulow
junction
with
blucher
we
shall
presently
have
occasion
to
consider
what
opportunities
were
given
to
grouchy
during
the
and
what
he
might
have
effected
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
original
military
genius
but
the
failure
of
grouchy
was
in
truth
mainly
owing
to
the
indomitable
heroism
of
blucher
himself
who
though
he
had
received
severe
personal
injuries
in
the
battle
of
ligny
was
as
energetic
and
ready
as
ever
in
bringing
his
men
into
action
again
and
who
had
the
resolution
to
expose
a
part
of
his
army
under
thielman
to
be
overwhelmed
by
grouchy
at
wavre
on
the
while
he
urged
the
march
of
the
mass
of
his
troops
upon
waterloo
it
is
not
at
wavre
but
at
waterloo
said
the
old
that
the
campaign
is
to
be
decided
and
he
risked
a
detachment
and
won
the
campaign
accordingly
wellington
and
blucher
trusted
each
other
as
cordially
and
as
zealously
as
formerly
had
been
the
case
with
marlborough
and
eugene
it
was
in
full
reliance
on
blucher
promise
to
join
him
that
the
duke
stood
his
ground
and
fought
at
waterloo
and
those
who
have
ventured
to
impugn
the
duke
capacity
as
a
general
ought
to
have
had
enough
to
perceive
that
to
charge
the
duke
with
having
won
the
battle
of
waterloo
by
the
help
of
the
prussians
is
really
to
say
that
he
won
it
by
the
very
means
on
which
he
relied
and
without
the
expectation
of
which
the
battle
would
not
have
been
fought
napoleon
himself
has
found
fault
with
wellington
for
not
having
retreated
further
so
as
to
complete
a
junction
of
his
army
with
blucher
before
he
risked
a
general
engagement
see
memoirs
vol
iv
p
but
as
we
have
seen
the
duke
justly
considered
it
important
to
protect
brussels
he
had
reason
to
expect
that
his
army
could
singly
resist
the
french
at
waterloo
until
the
prussians
came
up
and
that
on
the
prussians
joining
there
would
be
a
sufficient
force
united
under
himself
and
blucher
for
completely
overwhelming
the
enemy
and
while
napoleon
thus
censures
his
great
adversary
he
involuntarily
bears
the
highest
possible
testimony
to
the
military
character
of
the
english
and
proves
decisively
of
what
paramount
importance
was
the
battle
to
which
he
challenged
his
fearless
opponent
napoleon
asks
if
the
english
army
had
been
beaten
at
waterloo
what
would
have
been
the
use
of
those
numerous
bodies
of
troops
of
prussians
austrians
germans
and
spaniards
which
were
advancing
by
forced
marches
to
the
rhine
the
alps
and
the
pyrenees
ibid
the
strength
of
the
army
under
the
duke
of
wellington
at
waterloo
was
infantry
cavalry
and
artillerymen
with
guns
siborne
vol
p
but
of
this
total
of
men
scarcely
were
british
a
circumstance
of
very
serious
importance
if
napoleon
own
estimate
of
the
relative
value
of
troops
of
different
nations
is
to
be
taken
in
the
emperor
own
words
speaking
of
this
campaign
a
french
soldier
would
not
be
equal
to
more
than
one
english
soldier
but
he
would
not
be
afraid
to
meet
two
dutchmen

soldiers

there

proved
themselves
deserving

the

who

the

at

the
admirable

of
the

and
of
the
conflicting
armies
which
was
executed
by
captain
siborne
may
gain
a
generally
accurate
idea
of
the
localities
by
picturing
to
themselves
a
valley
between
two
and
three
miles
long
of
various
breadths
at
different
points
but
generally
not
exceeding
half
a
mile
on
each
side
of
the
valley
there
is
a
winding
chain
of
low
hills
running
somewhat
parallel
with
each
other
the
declivity
from
each
of
these
ranges
of
hills
to
the
intervening
valley
is
gentle
but
not
uniform
the
undulations
of
the
ground
being
frequent
and
considerable
the
english
army
was
posted
on
the
northern
and
the
french
army
occupied
the
southern
ridge
the
artillery
of
each
side
thundered
at
the
other
from
their
respective
heights
throughout
the
day
and
the
charges
of
horse
and
foot
were
made
across
the
valley
that
has
been
described
the
village
of
mont
jean
is
situate
a
little
behind
the
centre
of
the
northern
chain
of
hills
and
the
village
of
la
belle
alliance
is
close
behind
the
centre
of
the
southern
ridge
the
high
road
from
charleroi
to
brussels
a
broad
paved
causeway
runs
through
both
these
villages
and
bisects
therefore
both
the
english
and
the
french
positions
the
line
of
this
road
was
the
line
of
napoleon
intended
advance
on
brussels
there
are
some
other
local
particulars
connected
with
the
situation
of
each
army
which
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
the
strength
of
the
british
position
did
not
consist
merely
in
the
occupation
of
a
ridge
of
high
ground
a
village
and
ravine
called
merk
braine
on
the
duke
of
wellington
extreme
right
secured
his
flank
from
being
turned
on
that
side
and
on
his
extreme
left
two
little
hamlets
called
la
haye
and
papelotte
gave
a
similar
though
a
slighter
protection
behind
the
whole
british
position
is
the
extensive
forest
of
soignies
as
no
attempt
was
made
by
the
french
to
turn
either
of
the
english
flanks
and
the
battle
was
a
day
of
straightforward
fighting
it
is
chiefly
important
to
ascertain
what
posts
there
were
in
front
of
the
british
line
of
hills
of
which
advantage
could
be
taken
either
to
repel
or
facilitate
an
attack
and
it
will
be
seen
that
there
were
two
and
that
each
was
of
very
great
importance
in
the
action
in
front
of
the
british
right
that
is
to
say
on
the
northern
slope
of
the
valley
towards
its
western
end
there
stood
an
flemish
called
goumont
or
hougoumont
with
and
a
garden
and
with
a
copse
of
beach
trees
of
about
two
acres
in
extent
round
it
this
was
strongly
garrisoned
by
the
allied
troops
and
while
it
was
in
their
possession
it
was
difficult
for
the
enemy
to
press
on
and
force
the
british
right
wing
on
the
other
hand
if
the
enemy
could
take
it
it
would
be
difficult
for
that
wing
to
keep
its
ground
on
the
heights
with
a
strong
post
held
adversely
in
its
immediate
front
being
one
that
would
give
much
shelter
to
the
enemy
marksmen
and
great
facilities
for
the
sudden
concentration
of
attacking
columns
almost
immediately
in
front
of
the
british
centre
and
not
so
far
down
the
slope
as
hougoumont
there
was
another
of
a
smaller
size
called
la
haye
sainte
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
hamlet
of
la
haye
at
the
extreme
left
of
the
british
line
which
was
also
held
by
the
british
troops
and
the
occupation
of
which
was
found
to
be
of
very
serious
consequence
with
respect
to
the
french
position
the
principal
feature
to
be
noticed
is
the
village
of
planchenoit
which
lay
a
little
in
the
rear
of
their
right
on
the
eastern
side
and
which
proved
to
be
of
great
importance
in
aiding
them
to
check
the
advance
of
the
prussians
napoleon
in
his
memoirs
and
other
french
writers
have
vehemently
blamed
the
duke
for
having
given
battle
in
such
a
position
as
that
of
waterloo
they
particularly
object
that
the
duke
fought
without
having
the
means
of
a
retreat
if
the
attacks
of
his
enemy
had
proved
successful
and
that
the
english
army
if
once
broken
must
have
lost
all
its
guns
and
materiel
in
its
flight
through
the
forest
of
soignies
that
lay
in
its
rear
in
answer
to
these
censures
instead
of
merely
referring
to
the
event
of
the
battle
as
proof
of
the
correctness
of
the
duke
judgment
it
is
to
be
observed
that
many
military
critics
of
high
authority
have
considered
the
position
of
waterloo
to
have
been
admirably
adapted
for
the
duke
purpose
of
protecting
brussels
by
a
battle
and
that
certainly
the
duke
opinion
in
favour
of
it
was
not
lightly
or
hastily
formed
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
mentioned
in
the
speech
of
lord
bathurst
when
moving
the
vote
of
thanks
to
the
duke
in
the
house
of
lords
parliamentary
debates
vol
xxxi
p
that
when
the
duke
of
wellington
was
passing
through
belgium
in
the
preceding
summer
of
he
particularly
noticed
the
strength
of
the
position
of
waterloo
and
made
a
minute
of
it
at
the
time
stating
to
those
who
were
with
him
that
if
it
ever
should
be
his
fate
to
fight
a
battle
in
that
quarter
for
the
protection
of
brussels
he
should
endeavour
to
do
so
in
that
position
and
with
respect
to
the
forest
of
soignies
which
the
french
and
some
few
english
critics
have
thought
calculated
to
prove
so
fatal
to
a
retreating
force
the
duke
on
the
contrary
believed
it
to
be
a
post
that
might
have
proved
of
infinite
value
to
his
army
in
the
event
of
his
having
been
obliged
to
give
way
the
forest
of
soignies
has
no
thicket
or
masses
of
trees
it
consists
of
tall
beeches
and
is
everywhere
passable
for
men
and
horses
the
artillery
could
have
been
withdrawn
by
the
broad
road
which
traverses
it
towards
brussels
and
in
the
meanwhile
a
few
regiments
of
resolute
infantry
could
have
held
the
forest
and
kept
the
pursuers
in
check
one
of
the
best
writers
on
the
waterloo
campaign
captain
pringle
see
the
appendix
to
the
volume
of
scott
life
of
napoleon
well
observes
that
every
person
the
least
experienced
in
war
knows
the
extreme
difficulty
of
forcing
infantry
from
a
wood
which
can
not
be
turned
the
defence
of
the
bois
de
bossu
near
quatre
bras
on
the
of
june
had
given
a
good
proof
of
this
and
the
duke
of
wellington
when
speaking
in
after
years
of
the
possible
events
that
might
have
followed
if
he
had
been
beaten
back
from
the
open
field
of
waterloo
pointed
to
the
wood
of
soignies
as
his
secure
rallying
place
saying
they
never
could
have
beaten
us
so
that
we
could
not
have
held
the
wood
against
them
he
was
always
confident
that
he
could
have
made
good
that
post
until
joined
by
the
prussians

whose
he
throughout
depended

could
against

blucher
moved
with
the

of

through

calculated
that
they
would
be
there
by

the
extremely
difficult
nature
of
the
ground
which
they
had
to
traverse
rendered
worse
by
the

of

that
had
just
fallen
delayed
them

twelve

army

less
animated
by
bitter
hate
against
the
enemy
than
was
the
prussians

under
a
less
energetic
chief
than
blucher
would
have
failed
altogether
in
effecting
a
passage
through
the
swamps
into
which
the
incessant
rain
had
transformed
the
greater
part
of
the
ground
through
which
it
was
necessary
to
move

with
columns

with

point
of
the
march
on
entering

the
spirits
of
the
prussians
almost
gave
way

in
the
attempts
to
extricate
and
drag
forward

heavy
guns
the
men

to
murmur
blucher
came
to
the
spot
and
heard
cries
from
the
ranks
of
we
can
not
get
on
but
you
must
get
on
was
the
old
answer
i
have
pledged
my
word
to

you
surely
will
not
make
me
break

only
exert
yourselves
for
a

hours
longer
and
we
are
sure
of

this
appeal
from

the
reason

cavilled

may
be
best
given
in
the
words
of
baron
muffling
the
duke
had
retired
from

in
three
columns
by
three
chaussees
and
on
the
evening
of
the

frederick
of

was
at
hal
lord
hill
at
braine
la
leud
and
the
prince
of
orange
with
the
reserve
at
mont
jean
this
distribution
was
necessary
as
napoleon
could
dispose
of
these
three
roads
for
his
advance
on
brussels
napoleon
on
the
had
pressed
on
by
genappe
as
far
as
rossomme
on
the
two
other
roads
no
enemy
had
yet
shown
himself
on
the
the
offensive
was
taken
by
napoleon
on
its
greatest
scale
but
still
the
nivelles
road
was
not
overstepped
by
his
left
wing
these
circumstances
made
it
possible
to
draw
prince
frederick
to
the
army
which
would
certainly
have
been
done
if
entirely
new
circumstances
had
not
arisen
the
duke
had
hours
before
pledged
himself
to
accept
a
battle
at
mont
jean
if
blucher
would
assist
him
there
with
one
corps
of
men
this
being
promised
the
duke
was
taking
his
measures
for
defence
when
he
learned
that
in
addition
to
the
one
corps
promised
blucher
was
actually
already
on
the
march
with
his
whole
force
to
break
in
by
planchenoit
on
napoleon
flank
and
rear
if
three
corps
of
the
prussian
army
should
penetrate
by
the
unguarded
plateau
of
rossomme
which
was
not
improbable
napoleon
would
be
thrust
from
his
line
of
retreat
by
genappe
and
might
possibly
lose
even
that

nivelles
in
this
case
prince
frederick

his
men

might
be
accounted
superfluous
at

might
have
rendered
the
most
essential
service

quarterly
review

it
is
also
worthy

slept
a
few
hours
at

headquarters
in

rising
on

he
wrote
several
letters
to
the
governor
of
antwerp
to
the
english
minister
at
brussels
and
other
official
personages
in
which
he
expressed
his
confidence
that
all
would
go
well
but
as
it
was
necessary
to
provide
against
serious
losses
should
any
accident
occur
he
gave
a
series
of
judicious
orders
for
what
should
be
done
in
the
rear
of
the
army
in
the
event
of

also
before
he
left
the
village
of

saw
to
the
distribution
of
the
reserves

had
been
parked
there
so
that
supplies
should
be
readily
forwarded
to

they
might

also
personally
inspected
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
for
receiving
the
wounded
and
providing
temporary
hospitals
in
the
houses
in

of

rode
along

the
object
of
his
special
attention
he
rode
down
to
the
extremity
of
its
enclosures
and
after
having
examined
the
nearest
french

he
made
some
changes
in
the
disposition
of
his
own
men
who
were
to
defend
that
important
post

given
his
final
orders

the

galloped
back
to

position

halting
there
sat
watching
the
enemy
on

conversing
with

that
cheerful
serenity

was
ever
his
characteristic
in

hour

a
glance
of

have

visions
of
victory

glory
came
thronging
on
each

not
unmingled
with
recollections
of
the
home
which
his
fall
might
soon
leave
desolate
nor
without
shrinking

sometimes
prompting
the
cold
thought
that
in

moments
he
might
be
writhing
in

lie
a
trampled
and
mangled
mass
of
clay

at
the

early
age

more
conspicuous
stage
on
which
the
french

youthful
genius
was
displayed
his
heritage

the
whole
military
power

the
french
republic
the
position
on
which
for
years
he
was
elevated
as
sovereign
head
of
an
empire
surpassing
that
of
charlemagne

the
dazzling
results
of
his
victories
which
made
and

had
given
him
a
formidable
in
the
eyes
of
mankind
military
men
spoke
with
justly
rapturous
admiration
of
the
brilliancy
of
his
first
italian
campaigns

he
broke
through
the
pedantry
of
traditional
tactics

with
a
small
but
force
shattered
army

the
iniquity
of
his
egyptian
expedition

too
often
forgotten
in
contemplating
the
skill
and
boldness
with
which
he
destroyed
the
mameluke
cavalry
at
the
pyramids

the
turkish
infantry
at

none
could
forget
the
marvellous
passage
of
the

or
the
victory
of
marengo

wrested
italy
back
from

destroyed
the
fruit
of

gained

imputed

early
months

rightly
cited
as
the
most
splendid
exhibition
of

military
genius

with

inferior

checked
and
frequently
defeated

vast
hosts

illustrious
as

destroyer
of

as
the
liberator
of

and
the
successful
invader
of

in

had
held

had
displayed
eminent
skill
in
planning
and
combining
movements
and
unrivalled
celerity
and
boldness
in
execution
on
his
return
to
europe
several
years
passed
away
before
any
fitting
opportunity
was
accorded
for
the
exercise
of
his
genius
in
this
important
respect
wellington
as
a
subject
and
napoleon
as
a
sovereign
were
far
differently
situated
at
length
his
appointment
to
the
command
in
the
spanish
peninsula
gave
him
the
means
of
showing
europe
that
england
had
a
general
who
could
revive
the
glories
of

wellington
met
soult
manoeuvres
with
superior
skill
and
his
boldness
with
superior
vigour
when
napoleon
first
abdication
in
suspended
hostilities
wellington
was
master
of
the
fairest
districts
of
southern
france
and
had
under
him
a
veteran
army
with
which
to
use
his
own
expressive
phrase
he
felt
he
could
have
gone
anywhere
and
done
anything
the
fortune
of
war
had
hitherto
kept
separate
the
orbits
in
which
napoleon
and
he
had
moved
now
on
the
ever
memorable
of
june
they
met
at
last
it
is
indeed
remarkable
that
napoleon
during
his
numerous
campaigns
in
spain
as
well
as
other
countries
not
only
never
encountered
the
duke
of
wellington
before
the
day
of
waterloo
but
that
he
was
never
until
then
personally
engaged
with
british
troops
except
at
the
siege
of
toulon
in
which
was
the
very
first
incident
of
his
military
career
many
however
of
the
french
generals
who
were
with
him
in
knew
well
by
sharp
experience
what
english
soldiers
were
and
what
the
leader
was
who
now
headed
them
ney
foy
and
other
officers
who
had
served
in
the
peninsula
warned
napoleon
that
he
would
find
the
english
infantry
very
devils
in
fight
the
emperor
however
persisted
in
employing
the
old
system
of
attack
with
which
the
french
generals
often
succeeded
against
continental
troops
but
which
had
always
failed
against
the
english
in
the
peninsula
he
adhered
to
his
usual
tactics
of
employing
the
order
of
the
column
a
mode
of
attack
probably
favoured
by
him
as
sir
walter
scott
remarks
on
account
of
his
faith
in
the
extreme
valour
of
the
french
officers
by
whom
the
column
was
headed
it
is
a
threatening
formation
well
calculated
to
shake
the
firmness
of
ordinary
foes
but
which
when
steadily
met
as
the
english
have
met
it
by
heavy
volleys
of
musketry
from
an
extended
line
followed
up
by
a
resolute
bayonet
charge
has
always
resulted
in
disaster
to
the
assailants
see
especially
sir
napier
glorious
pictures
of
the
battles
of
busaco
and
albuera
the
theoretical
advantages
of
the
attack
in
column
and
its
peculiar
fitness
for
a
french
army
are
set
forth
in
the
chevalier
folard
traite
de
la
colonne
prefixed
to
the
first
volume
of
his
polybius
see
also
the
preface
to
his
sixth
volume
it
was
approaching
noon
before
the
action
commenced
napoleon
in
his
memoirs
gives
as
the
reason
for
this
delay
the
miry
state
of
the
ground
through
the
heavy
rain
of
the
preceding
night
and
day
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
cavalry
or
artillery
to
manoeuvre
on
it
till
a
few
hours
of
dry
weather
had
given
it
its
natural
consistency
it
has
been
supposed
also
that
he
trusted
to
the
effect
which
the
sight
of
the
imposing
array
of
his
own
forces
was
likely
to
produce
on
the
part
of
the
allied
army
the
belgian
regiments
had
been
tampered
with
and
napoleon
had
hopes
of
seeing
them
quit
the
duke
of
wellington
in
a
body
and
range
themselves
under
his
own
eagles
the
duke
however
who
knew
and
did
not
trust
them
had
guarded
against
the
risk
of
this
by
breaking
up
the
corps
of
belgians
and
distributing
them
in
separate
regiments
among
troops
on
whom
he
could
rely
siborne

p
at

at
about
eleven
napoleon
began
the
battle
by
directing

powerful
force
from

wing

brother
prince
jerome
to
attack

the
french
now
descended
from
the
west
of

assailed
that
post
with
fiery
valour
which
was
encountered
with
the
most
determined
bravery
the
french
won
the
copse
round
the
house
but
a
party
of
the
british
guards
held
the
house
itself
throughout
the
day
the
whole
of

required
to
man
this
post
amid

and
shot

the
blazing
fragments

buildings
this
obstinate
contest
was
continued
but
still
the
english
were
firm
in
hougoumont
though
the
french
occasionally
moved
forward
in
such
numbers
as
enabled
them
to
surround
and
mask
it
with
part
of
their
troops

left
wing

others
pressed
onward
up

commenced
at
first
between
the
british
right
and

of
the
attack
on

grand
attack
to
be
made

this
purpose
four
columns

eighteen

were
collected

by
a
strong
division

french
halted
and
began
to
deploy
into
line
picton
seized
the
critical
moment
he
shouted
in
his
stentorian
voice
to
kempt
brigade
a
volley
and
then
charge
at
a
distance
of
less
than
thirty
yards
that
volley
was
poured
upon
the
devoted
first
sections
of
the
nearest
column
and
then
with
a
fierce
hurrah
the
british
dashed
in
with
the
bayonet
picton
was
shot
dead
as
he
rushed
forward
but
his
men
pushed
on
with
the
cold
steel
the
french
reeled
back
in
confusion
pack
infantry
had
checked
the
other
two
columns
and
down
came
a
whirlwind
of
british
horse
on
the
whole
mass
sending
them
staggering
from
the
crest
of
the

and
cutting
them
down

on
went
the
horsemen
amid
the
wrecks
of

capturing
two

and
two

onwards
still
they
galloped
and
sabred

then
severing
the

and
cutting
the
throats
of

they
rendered
these

totally
useless
to
the
french
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
day
while
thus
far
advanced
beyond
the
british
position
and
disordered
by
success
they
were
charged
by
a
large
body
of
french
lancers
and
driven
back
with
severe
loss
till
vandeleur

horse
came
to
their
aid
and
beat
off
the
french
lancers
in
their
turn
equally
unsuccessful
with
the
advance
of
the
french
infantry
in
this
grand
attack
had
been
the
efforts
of
the
french
cavalry
who
moved
forward
in
support
of
it
along
the
east
of
the
charleroi
road
somerset
cavalry
of
the
english
household
brigade
had
been
launched
on
the
right
of
picton

against
the
french

at
the
same
time
that
the
english

formed
of
the

guards
the
blues
and
the
dragoon
guards
the
hostile
cavalry
which
kellerman
led
forward
consisted
chiefly
of
cuirassiers
this
mass
of
french
horsemen
rode
down
some
companies
of
german
infantry
near
la
haye
sainte
and
flushed
with
success
they
bounded
onward
to
the
ridge
of
the
british
position
the
english
household
brigade
led
on
by
the
earl
of
uxbridge
in
person
spurred
forward
to
the
encounter
and
in
an
instant
the
two
adverse
lines
of
strong
swordsmen
on
their
strong
steeds
dashed
furiously
together
a
desperate
and
sanguinary
fight
ensued
in
which
the
physical
superiority
of
the
guided
by
equal
skill
and
animated
with
equal
valour
was
made
decisively
manifest
back
went
the
chosen
cavalry
of

and
after
them
in
hot
pursuit
spurred
the
english
guards
they
went
forward
as
far
and
as
fiercely
as
their
comrades
of
the
union
brigade
and
like
them
the
household
cavalry
suffered
severely
before
they
regained
the
british
position
after
their
magnificent
charge
and
adventurous
pursuit
napoleon
grand
effort
to
break
the
english
left
centre
had
thus
completely
failed
and
his
right
wing
was
seriously
weakened
by
the
heavy
loss
which
it
had
sustained
hougoumont
was
still
being
assailed
and
was
still
successfully
resisting
troops
were
now
beginning
to
appear
at
the
edge
of
the
horizon
on
napoleon
right
which
he
too
well
knew
to
be
prussian
though
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
his
followers
that
they
were
grouchy
men
coming
to
their
aid
grouchy
was
in
fact
now
engaged
at
wavre
with
his
whole
force
against
thielmam
single
prussian
corps
while
the
other
three
corps
of
the
prussian
army
were
moving
without
opposition
save
from
the
difficulties
of
the
ground
upon
waterloo
grouchy
believed
on
the
and
caused
napoleon
to
believe
that
the
prussian
army
was
retreating
by
lines
of
march
remote
from
waterloo
upon
namur
and
maestricht
napoleon
learned
only
on
the
that
there
were
prussians
in
wavre
and
felt
jealous
about
the
security
of
his
own
right
he
accordingly
before
he
attacked
the
english
sent
grouchy
orders
to
engage
the
prussians
at
wavre
without
delay
and
to
approach
the
main
french
army
so
as
to
unite
his
communications
with
the
emperor
grouchy
entirely
neglected
this
last
part
of
his
instructions
and
in
attacking
the
prussians
whom
he
found
at
wavre
he
spread
his
force
more
and
more
towards
his
right
that
is
to
say
in
the
direction
most
remote
from
napoleon
he
thus
knew
nothing
of
blucher
and
bulow
flank
march
upon
waterloo
till
six
in
the
evening
of
the
when
he
received
a
note
which
soult
by
orders
had
sent
off
from
the
field
of
battle
at
waterloo
at
one
to
inform
grouchy
that
bulow
was
coming
over
the
heights
of
lambert
on
the
emperor
right
flank
and
directing
grouchy
to
approach
and
join
the
main
army
instantly
and
crush
bulow
en
flagrant
delit
it
was
then
too
late
for
grouchy
to
obey
but
it
is
remarkable
that
as
early
as
noon
on
the
and
while
grouchy
had
not
proceeded
as
far
as
wavre
he
and
his
suite
heard
the
sound
of
heavy
cannonading
in
the
direction
of
planchenoit
and
mont
jean
general
gerard
who
was
with
grouchy
implored
him
to
march
towards
the
cannonade
and
join
his
operations
with
those
of
napoleon
who
was
evidently
engaged
with
the
english
grouchy
refused
to
do
so
or
even
to
detach
part
of
his
force
in
that
direction
he
said
that
his
instructions
were
to
fight
the
prussians
at
wavre
he
marched
upon
wavre
and
fought
for
the
rest
of
the
day
with
thielman
accordingly
while
blucher
and
bulow
were
attacking
the
emperor
i
have
heard
the
remark
made
that
grouchy
twice
had
in
his
hands
the
power
of
changing
the
destinies
of
europe
and
twice
wanted
nerve
to
act
first
when
he
flinched
from
landing
the
french
army
at
bantry
bay
in
he
was
second
in
command
to
hoche
whose
ship
was
blown
back
by
a
storm
and
secondly
when
he
failed
to
lead
his
whole
force
from
wavre
to
the
scene
of
decisive
conflict
at
waterloo
but
such
were
the
arrangements
of
the
prussian
general
that
even
if
grouchy
had
marched
upon
waterloo
he
would
have
been
held
in
check
by
the
nearest
prussian
corps
or
certainly
by
the
two
nearest
ones
while
the
rest
proceeded
to
join
wellington
this
however
would
have
diminished
the
number
of
prussians
who
appeared
at
waterloo
and
what
is
still
more
important
would
have
kept
them
back
to
a
later
see
siborne
vol
and
gleig
there
are
some
very
valuable
remarks
on
this
subject
in
the
no
of
the
quarterly
in
an
article
on
the
life
of
blucher
usually
attributed
to
sir
francis
head
the
prussian
writer
general
clausewitz
is
there
cited
as
expressing
a
positive
opinion
in
which
every
military
critic
but
a
frenchman
must
concur
that
even
had
the
whole
of
force
been
at
napoleon
disposal
the
duke
had
nothing
to
fear
pending
blucher
arrival
the
duke
is
often
talked
of
as
having
exhausted
his
reserves
in
the
action
this
is
another
gross
error
which
clausewitz
has
thoroughly
disposed
of
he
enumerates
the
tenth
british
brigade
the
division
of
chasse
and
the
cavalry
of
collaert
as
having
been
little
or
not
at
all
engaged
and
he
might
have
also
added
two
brigades
of
light
cavalry
the
fact
also
that
wellington
did
not
at
any
part
of
the
day
order
up
prince
frederick
corps
from
hal
is
a
conclusive
proof
that
the
duke
was
not
so
distressed
as
some
writers
have
represented
hal
is
not
ten
miles
from
the
field
of
waterloo
napoleon
had
witnessed
with
bitter
disappointment
the
rout
of
his
troops
foot
horse
and
artillery
which
attacked
the
left
centre
of
the
english
and
the
obstinate
resistance
which
the
garrison
of
hougoumont
opposed
to
all
the
exertions
of
his
left
wing
he
now
caused
the
batteries
along
the
line
of
high
ground
held
by
him
to
be
strengthened
and
for
some
time
an
unremitting
and
most
destructive
cannonade
raged
across
the
valley
to
the
partial
cessation
of
other
conflict
but
the
superior
fire
of
the
french
artillery
though
it
weakened
could
not
break
the
british
line
and
more
close
and
summary
measures
were
requisite
it
was
now
about
three
and
though
wellington
army
had
suffered
severely
by
the
unremitting
cannonade
and
in
the
late
desperate
encounter
no
part
of
the
british
position
had
been
forced
napoleon
determined
therefore
to
try
what
effect
he
could
produce
on
the
british
centre
and
right
by
charges
of
his
splendid
cavalry
brought
on
in
such
force
that
the
duke
cavalry
could
not
check
them
fresh
troops
were
at
the
same
time
sent
to
assail
la
haye
sainte
and
hougoumont
the
possession
of
these
posts
being
the
emperor
unceasing
object
squadron
after
squadron
of
the
french
cuirassiers
accordingly
ascended
the
slopes
on
the
duke
right
and
rode
forward
with
dauntless
courage
against
the
batteries
of
the
british
artillery
in
that
part
of
the
field
the
were
driven
from
their
guns
and
the
cuirassiers
cheered
loudly
at
their
supposed
triumph
but
the
duke
had
formed
his
infantry
in
squares
and
the
cuirassiers
charged
in
vain
against
the
impenetrable
hedges
of
bayonets
while
the
fire
from
the
inner
ranks
of
the
squares
told
with
terrible
effect
on
their
squadrons
time
after
time
they
rode
forward
with
invariably
the
same
result
and
as
they
receded
from
each
attack
the
british
artillerymen
rushed
forward
from
the
centres
of
the
squares
where
they
had
taken
refuge
and
plied
their
guns
on
the
retiring
horsemen
nearly
the
whole
of
napoleon
magnificent
body
of
heavy
cavalry
was
destroyed
in
these
fruitless
attempts
upon
the
british
right
but
in
another
part
of
the
field
fortune
favoured
him
for
a
time
two
french
columns
of
infantry
from
donzelot
division
took
la
haye

six
and

scott
there
was

to
be

blucher
and
bulow
were
beginning
to
press
hard
upon
the
french
right
as
early
as
five
napoleon
had
been
obliged
to
detach
lobau
infantry
and
domont
horse
to
check
these
new
enemies
they
succeeded
in
doing
so
for
a
time
but
as
larger
numbers
of
the
prussians
came
on
the
field
they
turned
lobau
right
flank
and
sent
a
strong
force
to
seize
the
village
of
planchenoit
which
it
will
be
remembered
lay
in
the
rear
of
the
french
right
the
design
of
the
allies
was
not
merely
to
prevent
napoleon
from
advancing
upon
brussels
but
to
cut
off
his
line
of
retreat
and
utterly
destroy
his
army
the
defence
of
planchenoit
therefore
became
absolutely
essential
for
the
safety
of
the
french
and
napoleon
was
obliged
to
send
his
young
guard
to
occupy
that
village
which
was
accordingly
held
by
them
with
great
gallantry
against
the
reiterated
assaults
of
the
prussian
left
under
bulow
three
times
did
the
prussians
fight
their
way
into
planchenoit
and
as
often
did
the
french
drive
them
out
the
contest
was
maintained
with
the
fiercest
desperation
on
both
sides
such
being
the
animosity
between
the
two
nations
that
quarter
was
seldom
given
or
even
asked
other
prussian
forces
were
now
appearing
on
the
field
nearer
to
the
english
left
whom
also
napoleon
kept
in
check
by
troops
detached
for
that
purpose
thus
a
large
part
of
the
french
army
was
now
thrown
back
on
a
line
at
right
angles
with
the
line
of
that
portion
which
still
confronted
and
assailed
the
english
position
but
this
portion
was
now
numerically
inferior
to
the
force
under
the
duke
of
wellington
which
napoleon
had
been
assailing
throughout
the
day
without
gaining
any
other
advantage
than
the
capture
of
la
haye
sainte
it
is
true
that
owing
to
the
gross
misconduct
of
the
greater
part
of
the
dutch
and
belgian
troops
the
duke
was
obliged
to
rely
exclusively
on
his
english
and
german
soldiers
and
the
ranks
of
these
had
been
fearfully
thinned
but
the
survivors
stood
their
ground
heroically
and
opposed
a
resolute
front
to
every
forward
movement
of
their
enemies
on
no
point
of
the
british
line
was
the
pressure
more
severe
than
on
halkett
brigade
in
the
right
centre
which
was
composed
of
battalions
of
the
the
the
and
the
british
regiments
we
fortunately
can
quote
from
the
journal
of
a
brave
officer
of
the
a
narrative
of
what
took
place
in
this
part
of
the
field
this
excellent
journal
was
published
in
the
united
service
magazine
during
the
year
the
late
major
macready
served
at
waterloo
in
the
light
company
of
the
the
extent
of
the
peril
and
the
carnage
which
brigade
had
to
encounter
may
be
judged
of
by
the
fact
that
this
light
company
marched
into
the
field
three
officers
and
men
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
battle
they
stood
one
officer
and
ten
men
major
macready
blunt
soldierly
account
of
what
he
actually
saw
and
felt
gives
a
far
better
idea
of
the
terrific
scene
than
can
be
gained
from
the
polished
generalisations
which
the
conventional
style
of
history
requires
or
even
from
the
glowing
stanzas
of
the
poet
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
macready
and
his
light
company
were
thrown
forward
as
skirmishers
in
front
of
the
brigade
but
when
the
french
cavalry
commenced
their
attacks
on
the
british
right
centre
he
and
his
comrades
were
ordered
back
the
brave
soldier
thus
himself
describes
what
passed
before
the
commencement
of
this
attack
our
company
and
the
grenadiers
of
the
were
skirmishing
briskly
in
the
low
ground
covering
our
guns
and
annoying
those
of
the
enemy
the
line
of
tirailleurs
opposed
to
us
was
not
stronger
than
our
own
but
on
a
sudden
they
were
reinforced
by
numerous
bodies
and
several
guns
began
playing
on
us
with
canister
our
poor
fellows
dropped
very
fast
and
colonel
vigoureux
rumley
and
pratt
were
carried
off
badly
wounded
in
about
two
minutes

was
now
commander
of
our
company
we
stood
under
this
hurricane
of
small
shot
till
halkett
sent
to
order
us
in
and
i
brought
away
about
a
third
of
the
light
bobs
the
rest
were
killed
or
wounded
and
i
really
wonder
how
one
of
them
escaped
as
our
bugler
was
killed
i
shouted
and
made
signals
to
move
by
the
left
in
order
to
avoid
the
fire
of
our
guns
and
to
put
as
good
a
face
upon
the
business
as
possible
when
i
reached
lloyd
abandoned
guns
i
stood
near
them
for
about
a
minute
to
contemplate
the
scene
it
was
grand
beyond
description
hougoumont
and
its
wood
sent
up
a
broad
flame
through
the
dark
masses
of
smoke
that
overhung
the
field
beneath
this
cloud
the
french
were
indistinctly
visible
here
a
waving
mass
of
long
red
feathers
could
be
seen
there
gleams
as
from
a
sheet
of
steel
showed
that
the
cuirassiers
were
moving
cannon
were
belching
forth
fire
and
death
on
every
side
the
roaring
and
shouting
were
indistinguishably
commixed
together
they
gave
me
an
idea
of
a
labouring
volcano
bodies
of
infantry
and
cavalry
were
pouring
down
on
us
and
it
was
time
to
leave
contemplation
so
i
moved
towards
our
columns
which
were
standing
up
in
square
our
regiment
and
formed
one
and
and
another
to
our
right
beyond
them
were
the
guards
and
on
our
left
the
hanoverians
and
german
legion
of
our
division
as
i
entered
the
rear
face
of
our
square
i
had
to
step
over
a
body
and
looking
down
recognised
harry
beers
an
officer
of
our
grenadiers
who
about
an
hour
before
shook
hands
with
me
laughing
as
i
left
the
columns
i
was
on
the
usual
terms
of
military
intimacy
with
poor
harry
that
is
to
say
if
either
of
us
had
died
a
natural
death
the
other
would
have
pitied
him
as
a
good
fellow
and
smiled
at
his
neighbour
as
he
congratulated
him
on
the
step
but
seeing
his
herculean
frame
and
animated
countenance
thus
suddenly
stiff
and
motionless
before
me
i
know
not
whence
the
feeling
could
originate
for
i
had
just
seen
my
dearest
friend
drop
almost
with
indifference
the
tears
started
in
my
eyes
as
i
sighed
out
harry
the
tear
was
not
dry
on
my
cheek
when
poor
harry
was
no
longer
thought
of
in
a
few
minutes
after
the
enemy
cavalry
galloped
up
and
crowned
the
crest
of
our
position
our
guns
were
abandoned
and
they
formed
between
the
two
brigades
about
a
hundred
paces
in
our
front
their
first
charge
was
magnificent
as
soon
as
they
quickened
their
trot
into
a
gallop
the
cuirassiers
bent
their
heads
so
that
the
peaks
of
their
helmets
looked
like
vizors
and
they
seemed
cased
in
armour
from
the
plume
to
the
saddle
not
a
shot
was
fired
till
they
were
within
thirty
yards
when
the
word
was
given
and
our
men
fired
away
at
them
the
effect
was
magical
through
the
smoke
we
could
see
helmets
falling
cavaliers
starting
from
their
seats
with
convulsive
springs
as
they
received
our
balls
horses
plunging
and
rearing
in
the
agonies
of
fright
and
pain
and
crowds
of
the
soldiery
dismounted
part
of
the
squadron
in
retreat
but
the
more
daring
remainder
backing
their
horses
to
force
them
on
our
bayonets
our
fire
soon
disposed
of
these
gentlemen
the
main
body
in
our
front
and
rapidly
and
gallantly
repeated
their
attacks
in
fact
from
this
time
about
four
till
near
six
we
had
a
constant
repetition
of
these
brave
but
unavailing
charges
there
was
no
difficulty
in
repulsing
them
but
our
ammunition
decreased
alarmingly
at
length
an
artillery
wagon
galloped
up
emptied
two
or
three
casks
of
cartridges
into
the
square
and
we
were
all
comfortable
the
best
cavalry
is
contemptible
to
a
steady
and
infantry
regiment
even
our
men
saw
this
and
began
to
pity
the
useless
perseverance
of
their
assailants
and
as
they
advanced
would
growl
out
come
these
fools
again
one
of
their
superior
officers
tried
a
ruse
de
guerre
by
advancing
and
dropping
his
sword
as
though
he
surrendered
some
of
us
were
deceived
by
him
but
halkett
ordered
the
men
to
fire
and
he
coolly
retired
saluting
us
their
devotion
was
invincible
one
officer
whom
we
had
taken
prisoner
was
asked
what
force
napoleon
might
have
in
the
field
and
replied
with
a
smile
of
mingled
derision
and
threatening
verrez
bientot
sa
force
messieurs
a
private
cuirassier
was
wounded
and
dragged
into
the
square
his
only
cry
was
donc
tuez
tuez
moi
soldats
and
as
one
of
our
men
dropped
dead
close
to
him
he
seized
his
bayonet
and
forced
it
into
his
own
neck
but
this
not
despatching
him
he
raised
up
his
cuirass
and
plunging
the
bayonet
into
his
stomach
kept
working
it
about
till
he
ceased
to
breathe
though
we
constantly
thrashed
our
opponents
we
found
more
troublesome
customers
in
the
round
shot
and
grape
which
all
this
time
played
on
us
with
terrible
effect
and
fully
avenged
the
cuirassiers
often
as
the
volleys
created
openings
in
our
square
would
the
cavalry
dash
on
but
they
were
uniformly
unsuccessful
a
regiment
on
our
right
seemed
sadly
disconcerted
and
at
one
moment
was
in
considerable
confusion
halkett
rode
out
to
them
and
seizing
their
colour
waved
it
over
his
head
and
restored
them
to
something
like
order
though
not
before
his
horse
was
shot
under
him
at
the
height
of
their
unsteadiness
we
got
the
order
to
face
to
move
to
their
assistance
some
of
the
men
mistook
it
for
about
face
and
faced
accordingly
when
old
major
called
out
my
boys
its
right
face
you
never
hear
the
right
about
as
long
as
a
french
bayonet
is
in
front
of
you
in
a
few
moments
he
was
mortally
wounded
a
regiment
of
light
dragoons
by
their
facings
either
the
or
came
up
to
our
left
and
charged
the
cuirassiers
we
cheered
each
other
as
they
passed
us
they
did
all
they
could
but
were
obliged
to
retire
after
a
few
minutes
at
the
sabre
a
body
of
belgian
cavalry
advanced
for
the
same
purpose
but
on
passing
our
square
they
stopped
short
our
noble
halkett
rode
out
to
them
and
offered
to
charge
at
their
head
it
was
of
no
use
the
prince
of
orange
came
up
and
exhorted
them
to
do
their
duty
but
in
vain
they
hesitated
till
a
few
shots
whizzed
through
them
when
they
turned
about
and
galloped
like
fury
or
rather
like
fear
as
they
passed
the
right
face
of
our
square
the
men
irritated
by
their
rascally
conduct
unanimously
took
up
their
pieces
and
fired
a
volley
into
them
and
a
good
fellow
was
destroyed
so
cowardly
the
enemy
cavalry
were
by
this
time
nearly
disposed
of
and
as
they
had
discovered
the
inutility
of
their
charges
they
commenced
annoying
us
by
a
spirited
and
carbine
fire
while
we
were
employed
in
this
manner
it
was
impossible
to
see
farther
than
the
columns
on
our
right
and
left
but
i
imagine
most
of
the
army
were
similarly
situated
all
the
british
and
germans
were
doing
their
duty
about
six
i
perceived
some
artillery
trotting
up
our
hill
which
i
knew
by
their
caps
to
belong
to
the
imperial
guard
i
had
hardly
mentioned
this
to
a
brother
officer
when
two
guns
unlimbered
within
seventy
paces
of
us
and
by
their
first
discharge
of
grape
blew
seven
men
into
the
centre
of
the
square
they
immediately
reloaded
and
kept
up
a
constant
and
destructive
fire
it
was
noble
to
see
our
fellows
fill
up
the
gaps
after
every
discharge
i
was
much
distressed
at
this
moment
having
ordered
up
three
of
my
light
bobs
they
had
hardly
taken
their
station
when
two
of
them
fell
horribly
lacerated
one
of
them
looked
up
in
my
face
and
uttered
a
sort
of
reproachful
groan
and
i
involuntarily
exclaimed
could
help
it
we
would
willingly
have
charged
these
guns
but
had
we
deployed
the
cavalry
that
flanked
them
would
have
made
an
example
of
us
the
vis
animi
the
glow
which
fires
one
upon
entering
into
action
had
ceased
it
was
now
to
be
seen
which
side
had
most
bottom
and
would
stand
killing
longest
the
duke
visited
us
frequently
at
this
momentous
period
he
was
coolness
personified
as
he
crossed
the
rear
face
of
our
square
a
shell
fell
amongst
our
grenadiers
and
he
checked
his
horse
to
see
its
effect
some
men
were
blown
to
pieces
by
the
explosion
and
he
merely
stirred
the
rein
of
his
charger
apparently
as
little
concerned
at
their
fate
as
at
his
own
danger
no
leader
ever
possessed
so
fully
the
confidence
of
his
soldiery
wherever
he
appeared
a
murmur
of
stand
to
your
front
here
the
duke
was
heard
through
the
column
and
then
all
was
steady
as
on
a
parade
his
colonels
canning
and
gordon
fell
near
our
square
and
the
former
died
within
it
as
he
came
near
us
late
in
the
evening
halkett
rode
out
to
him
and
represented
our
weak
state
begging
his
grace
to
afford
us
a
little
support
impossible
halkett
said
he
and
our
general
replied
so
sir
you
may
depend
on
the
brigade
to
a
man
all
accounts
of
the
battle
show
that
the
duke
was
ever
present
at
each
spot
where
danger
seemed
the
most
pressing
inspiriting
his
men
by
a
few
homely
and
words
and
restraining
their
impatience
to
be
led
forward
to
attack
in
their
hard
pounding
this
gentlemen
we
will
try
who
can
pound
the
longest
was
his
remark
to
a
battalion
on
which
the
storm
from
the
french
guns
was
pouring
with
peculiar
fury
riding
up
to
one
of
the
squares
which
had
been
dreadfully
weakened
and
against
which
a
fresh
attack
of
french
cavalry
was
coming
he
called
to
them
stand
firm
my
lads
what
will
they
say
of
this
in
england
as
he
rode
along
another
part
of
the
line
where
the
men
had
for
some
time
been
falling
fast
beneath
the
enemy
cannonade
without
having
any
close
fighting
a
murmur
reached
his
ear
of
natural
eagerness
to
advance
and
do
something
more
than
stand
still
to
be
shot
at
the
duke
called
to
them
wait
a
little
longer
my
lads
and
you
shall
have
your
wish
the
men
were
instantly
satisfied
and
steady
it
was
indeed
indispensable
for
the
duke
to
bide
his
time
the
premature
movement
of
a
single
corps
down
from
the
british
line
of
heights
would
have
endangered
the
whole
position
and
have
probably
made
waterloo
a
second
hastings
but
the
duke
inspired
all
under
him
with
his
own
spirit
of
patient
firmness
when
other
generals
besides
halkett
sent
to
him
begging
for
reinforcements
or
for
leave
to
withdraw
corps
which
were
reduced
to
skeletons
the
answer
was
the
same
it
is
impossible
you
must
hold
your
ground
to
the
last
man
and
all
will
be
well
he
gave
a
similar
reply
to
some
of
his
staff
who
asked
instructions
from
him
so
that
in
the
event
of
his
falling
his
successor
might
follow
out
his
plan
he
answered
my
plan
is
simply
to
stand
my
ground
here
to
the
last
man
his
personal
danger
was
indeed
imminent
throughout
the
day
and
though
he
escaped
without
injury
to
himself
or
horse
one
only
of
his
numerous
staff
was
equally
fortunate
as
far
as
the
french
accounts
would
lead
us
to
infer
it
appears
that
the
losses
among
napoleon
staff
were
comparatively
trifling
on
this
subject
perhaps
the
marked
contrast
afforded
by
the
following
anecdotes
which
have
been
related
to
me
on
excellent
authority
may
tend
to
throw
some
light
at
one
period
of
the
battle
when
the
duke
was
surrounded
by
several
of
his
staff
it
was
very
evident
that
the
group
had
become
the
object
of
the
fire
of
a
french
battery
the
shot
fell
fast
about
them
generally
striking
and
turning
up
the
ground
on
which
they
stood
their
horses
became
restive
and
himself
so
fidgetty
that
the
duke
getting
impatient
and
having
reasons
for
remaining
on
the
spot
said
to
those
about
him
we
are
rather
too
close
together
better
to
divide
a
little
subsequently
at
another
point
of
the
line
an
officer
of
artillery
came
up
to
the
duke
and
stated
that
he
had
a
distinct
view
of
napoleon
attended
by
his
staff
that
he
had
the
guns
of
his
battery
well
pointed
in
that
direction
and
was
prepared
to
fire
his
grace
instantly
and
emphatically
exclaimed
no
not
allow
it
it
is
not
the
business
of
commanders
to
be
firing
upon
each
other
siborne
vol
ii
how
different
is
this
from
napoleon
conduct
at
the
battle
of
dresden
when
he
personally
directed
the
fire
of
the
battery
which
as
he
thought
killed
the
emperor
alexander
and
actually
killed
moreau
napoleon
had
stationed
himself
during
the
battle
on
a
little
hillock
near
la
belle
alliance
in
the
centre
of
the
french
position
here
he
was
seated
with
a
large
table
from
the
neighbouring
before
him
on
which
maps
and
plans
were
spread
and
thence
with
his
telescope
he
surveyed
the
various
points
of
the
field
soult
watched
his
orders
close
at
his
left
hand
and
his
staff
was
grouped
on
horseback
a
few
paces
in
the
rear
souvenirs
militaires
par
ouvrard
who
attended
napoleon
as
chief
commissary
of
the
french
army
on
that
occasion
told
me
that
napoleon
was
suffering
from
a
complaint
which
made
it
very
painful
for
him
to
ride
lord
ellesmere
p
here
he
remained
till
near
the
close
of
the
day
preserving
the
appearance
at
least
of
calmness
except
some
expressions
of
irritation
which
escaped
him
when
ney
attack
on
the
british
left
centre
was
defeated
but
now
that
the
crisis
of
the
battle
was
evidently
approaching
he
mounted
a
white
persian
charger
which
he
rode
in
action
because
the
troops
easily
recognised
him
by
the
horse
colour
he
had
still
the
means
of
effecting
a
retreat
his
old
guard
had
yet
taken
no
part
in
the
action
under
cover
of
it
he
might
have
withdrawn
his
shattered
forces
and
retired
upon
the
french
frontier
but
this
would
only
have
given
the
english
and
prussians
the
opportunity
of
completing
their
junction
and
he
knew
that
other
armies
were
fast
coming
up
to
aid
them
in
a
march
upon
paris
if
he
should
succeed
in
avoiding
an
encounter
with
them
and
retreating
upon
the
capital
a
victory
at
waterloo
was
his
only
alternative
from
utter
ruin
and
he
determined
to
employ
his
guard
in
one
bold
stroke
more
to
make
that
victory
his
own
between
seven
and
eight
the
infantry
of
the
old
guard
was
formed
into
two
columns
on
the
declivity
near
la
belle
alliance
ney
was
placed
at
their
head
napoleon
himself
rode
forward
to
a
spot
by
which
his
veterans
were
to
pass
and
as
they
approached
he
raised
his
arm
and
pointed
to
the
position
of
the
allies
as
if
to
tell
them
that
their
path
lay
there
they
answered
with
loud
cries
of
vive
and
descended
the
hill
from
their
own
side
into
that
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
while
the
batteries
thundered
with
redoubled
vigour
over
their
heads
upon
the
british
line
the
line
of
march
of
the
columns
of
the
guard
was
directed
between
hougoumont
and
la
haye
sainte
against
the
british
right
centre
and
at
the
same
time
the
french
under
donzelot
who
had
possession
of
la
haye
sainte
commenced
a
fierce
attack
upon
the
british
centre
a
little
more
to
its
left
this
part
of
the
battle
has
drawn
less
attention
than
the
celebrated
attack
of
the
old
guard
but
it
formed
the
most
perilous
crisis
for
the
allied
army
and
if
the
young
guard
had
been
there
to
support
donzelot
instead
of
being
engaged
with
the
prussians
at
planchenoit
the
consequences
to
the
allies
in
that
part
of
the
field
must
have
been
most
serious
the
french
tirailleurs
who
were
posted
in
clouds
in
la
haye
sainte
and
the
sheltered
spots
near
it
picked
off
the
artillerymen
of
the
english
batteries
near
them
and
taking
advantage
of
the
disabled
state
of
the
english
guns
the
french
brought
some
up
to
la
haye
sainte
and
commenced
firing
grape
from
them
on
the
infantry
of
the
allies
at
a
distance
of
not
more
than
a
hundred
paces
the
allied
infantry
here
consisted
of
some
german
brigades
who
were
formed
in
squares
as
it
was
believed
that
donzelot
had
cavalry
ready
behind
la
haye
sainte
to
charge
them
with
if
they
left
that
order
of
formation
in
this
state
the
germans
remained
for
some
time
with
heroic
fortitude
though
the
was
tearing
gaps
in
their
ranks
and
the
side
of
one
square
was
literally
blown
away
by
one
tremendous
volley
which
the
french
gunners
poured
into
it
the
prince
of
orange
in
vain
endeavoured
to
lead
some
nassau
troops
to
the
aid
of
the
brave
germans
the
nassauers
would
not
or
could
not
face
the
french
and
some
battalions
of
brunswickers
whom
the
duke
of
wellington
had
ordered
up
as
a
reinforcement
at
first
fell
back
until
the
duke
in
person
rallied
them
and
led
them
on
having
thus
barred
the
farther
advance
of
donzelot
the
duke
galloped
off
to
the
right
to
head
his
men
who
were
exposed
to
the
attack
of
the
imperial
guard
he
had
saved
one
part
of
his
centre
from
being
routed
but
the
french
had
gained
ground
and
kept
it
and
the
pressure
on
the
allied
line
in
front
of
la
haye
sainte
was
fearfully
severe
until
it
was
relieved
by
the
decisive
success
which
the
british
in
the
right
centre
achieved
over
the
columns
of
the
guard
the
british
troops
on
the
crest
of
that
part
of
the
position
which
the
first
column
of
napoleon
guards
assailed
were
maitland
brigade
of
british
guards
having
adams
brigade
which
had
been
brought
forward
during
the
action
on
their
right
maitland
men
were
lying
down
in
order
to
avoid
as
far
as
possible
the
destructive
effect
of
the
french
artillery
which
kept
up
an
unremitting
fire
from
the
opposite
heights
until
the
first
column
of
the
imperial
guard
had
advanced
so
far
up
the
slope
towards
the
british
position
that
any
further
firing
of
the
french
artillerymen
would
have
endangered
their
own
comrades
meanwhile
the
british
guns
were
not
idle
but
shot
and
shell
ploughed
fast
through
the
ranks
of
the
stately
array
of
veterans
that
still
moved
imposingly
on
several
of
the
french
superior
officers
were
at
its
head
horse
was
shot
under
him
but
he
still
led
the
way
on
foot
sword
in
hand
the
front
of
the
massive
column
now
was
on
the
ridge
of
the
hill
to
their
surprise
they
saw
no
troops
before
them
all
they
could
discern
through
the
smoke
was
a
small
band
of
mounted
officers
one
of
them
was
the
duke
himself
the
french
advanced
to
about
fifty
yards
from
where
the
british
guards
were
lying
down
when
the
voice
of
one
of
the
group
of
british
officers
was
heard
calling
as
if
to
the
ground
before
him
up
guards
and
at
them
it
was
the
duke
who
gave
the
order
and
at
the
words
as
if
by
magic
up
started
before
them
a
line
of
the
british
guards
four
deep
and
in
the
most
compact
and
perfect
order
they
poured
an
instantaneous
volley
upon
the
head
of
the
french
column
by
which
no
less
than
three
hundred
of
those
chosen
veterans
are
said
to
have
fallen
the
french
officers
rushed
forwards
and
conspicuous
in
front
of
their
men
attempted
to
deploy
them
into
a
more
extended
line
so
as
to
enable
them
to
reply
with
effect
to
the
british
fire
but
brigade
kept
showering
in
volley
after
volley
with
deadly
rapidity
the
decimated
column
grew
disordered
in
its
vain
efforts
to
expand
itself
into
a
more
efficient
formation
the
right
word
was
given
at
the
right
moment
to
the
british
for
the
and
the
brigade
sprang
forward
with
a
loud
cheer
against
their
dismayed
antagonists
in
an
instant
the
compact
mass
of
the
french
spread
out
into
a
rabble
and
they
fled
back
down
the
hill
pursued
by
maitland
men
who
however
returned
to
their
position
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
repulse
of
the
second
column
of
the
imperial
guard
this
column
also
advanced
with
great
spirit
and
firmness
under
the
cannonade
which
was
opened
on
it
and
passing
by
the
eastern
wall
of
hougoumont
diverged
slightly
to
the
right
as
it
moved
up
the
slope
towards
the
british
position
so
as
to
approach
nearly
the
same
spot
where
the
first
column
had
surmounted
the
height
and
been
defeated
this
enabled
the
british
regiments
of
adams
brigade
to
form
a
line
parallel
to
the
left
flank
of
the
french
column
so
that
while
the
front
of
this
column
of
french
guards
had
to
encounter
the
cannonade
of
the
british
batteries
and
the
musketry
of
maitlands
guards
its
left
flank
was
assailed
with
a
destructive
fire
by
a
body
of
british
infantry
extending
all
along
it
in
such
a
position
all
the
bravery
and
skill
of
the
french
veterans
were
vain
the
second
column
like
its
predecessor
broke
and
fled
taking
at
first
a
lateral
direction
along
the
front
of
the
british
line
towards
the
rear
of
la
haye
sainte
and
so
becoming
blended
with
the
divisions
of
french
infantry
which
under
donzelot
had
been
assailing
the
allies
so
formidably
in
that
quarter
the
sight
of
the
old
guard
broken
and
in
flight
checked
the
ardour
which
donzelot
troops
had
hitherto
displayed
they
too
began
to
waver
adams
victorious
brigade
was
pressing
after
the
flying
guard
and
now
cleared
away
the
assailants
of
the
allied
centre
but
the
battle
was
not
yet
won
napoleon
had
still
some
battalions
in
reserve
near
la
belle
alliance
he
was
rapidly
rallying
the
remains
of
the
first
column
of
his
guards
and
he
had
collected
into
one
body
the
remnants
of
the
various
corps
of
cavalry
which
had
suffered
so
severely
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
the
duke
instantly
formed
the
bold
resolution
of
now
himself
becoming
the
assailant
and
leading
his
successful
though
enfeebled
army
forward
while
the
disheartening
effect
of
the
repulse
of
the
imperial
guard
on
the
rest
of
the
french
army
was
still
strong
and
before
napoleon
and
ney
could
rally
the
beaten
veterans
themselves
for
another
and
a
fiercer
charge
as
the
close
approach
of
the
prussians
now
completely
protected
the
duke
left
he
had
drawn
some
reserves
of
horse
from
that
quarter
and
he
had
a
brigade
of
hussars
under
vivian
fresh
and
ready
at
hand
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
launched
these
against
the
cavalry
near
la
belie
alliance
the
charge
was
as
successful
as
it
was
daring
and
as
there
was
now
no
hostile
cavalry
to
check
the
british
infantry
in
a
forward
movement
the
duke
gave
the
command
for
a
general
advance
of
the
army
along
the
whole
line
upon
the
foe
it
was
now
past
eight
and
for
nearly
nine
deadly
hours
had
the
british
and
german
regiments
stood
unflinching
under
the
fire
of
artillery
the
charge
of
cavalry
and
every
variety
of
assault
which
the
compact
columns
or
the
scattered
tirailleurs
of
the
enemy
infantry
could
inflict
as
they
joyously
sprang
forward
against
the
discomfited
masses
of
the
french
the
setting
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
which
had
obscured
the
sky
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
glittered
on
the
bayonets
of
the
allies
while
they
poured
down
into
the
valley
and
towards
the
heights
that
were
held
by
the
foe
the
duke
himself
was
among
the
foremost
in
the
advance
and
personally
directed
the
movements
against
each
body
of
the
french
that
essayed
resistance
he
rode
in
front
of
adams
brigade
cheering
it
forward
and
even
galloped
among
the
most
advanced
of
the
british
skirmishers
speaking
joyously
to
the
men
and
receiving
their
hearty
shouts
of
congratulation
the
bullets
of
both
friends
and
foes
were
whistling
fast
round
him
and
one
of
the
few
survivors
of
his
staff
remonstrated
with
him
for
thus
exposing
a
life
of
such
value
never
mind
was
the
answer
never
mind
let
them
fire
away
the
battle
won
and
my
life
is
of
no
consequence
now
and
indeed
almost
the
whole
of
the
french
host
was
now
in
irreparable
confusion
the
prussian
army
was
coming
more
and
more
rapidly
forwards
on
their
right
and
the
young
guard
which
had
held
planchenoit
so
bravely
was
at
last
compelled
to
give
way
some
regiments
of
the
old
guard
in
vain
endeavoured
to
form
in
squares
and
stem
the
current
they
were
swept
away
and
wrecked
among
the
waves
of
the
flyers
napoleon

placed
himself
in
one
of
these
squares
marshal
soult

bertrand
drouot
corbineau
de
flahaut
and
gourgaud
were
with
him
the
emperor
spoke
of
dying
on

but
soult
seized
his
bridle
and
turned
his
charger
round
exclaiming
sire
are
not

lucky
enough
colonel
memoires
the
colonel
states
that
he
heard
these
details
from
general
gourgaud
himself
the
english
reader
will
be
reminded
of
charles
i
retreat
from
naseby
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
only
by
the
utmost
exertion
of
the
devoted
officers
round
him
napoleon
cleared
the
throng
of
fugitives
and
escaped
from
the
scene
of
the
battle
and
the
war
which
he
and
france
had
lost
past
all
recovery
meanwhile
the
duke
of
wellington
still
rode
forward
with
the
van
of
his
victorious
troops
until
he
reined
up
on
the
elevated
ground
near
rossomme
the
daylight
was
now
entirely
gone
but
the
young
moon
had
risen
and
the
light
which
it
cast
aided
by
the
glare
from
the
burning
houses
and
other
buildings
in
the
line
of
the
flying
french
and
pursuing
prussians
enabled
the
duke
to
assure
himself
that
his
victory
was
complete
he
then
rode
back
along
the
charleroi
road
toward
waterloo
and
near
la
belle
alliance
he
met
marshal
blucher
warm
were
the
congratulations
that
were
exchanged
between
the
allied
chiefs
it
was
arranged
that
the
prussians
should
follow
up
the
pursuit
and
give
the
french
no
chance
of
rallying
accordingly
the
british
army
exhausted
by
its
toils
and
sufferings
during
that
dreadful
day
did
not
advance
beyond
the
heights
which
the
enemy
had
occupied
but
the
prussians
drove
the
fugitives
before
them
in
merciless
chase
throughout
the
night
cannon
baggage
and
all
the
materiel
of
the
army
were
abandoned
by
the
french
and
many
thousands
of
the
infantry
threw
away
their
arms
to
facilitate
their
escape
the
ground
was
strewn
for
miles
with
the
wrecks
of
their
host
there
was
no
nor
was
even
the
semblance
of
order

an
attempt
at

made
at

pass
through

the
bulk
of
the
french
retired
the
situation
was
favourable
and
a
few
resolute
battalions
if
ably
commanded
might
have
held
their
pursuers
at
bay
there
for
some
considerable
time
but
despair
and
panic
were
now
universal
in
the
beaten
army
at
the
first
sound
of
the
prussian
drums
and
bugles
genappe
was
abandoned
and
nothing
thought
of
but
headlong
flight
the
prussians
under
general
gneisenau
still
followed
and
still
slew
nor
even
when
the
prussian
infantry
stopped
in
sheer
exhaustion
was
the
pursuit
given
up
gneisenau
still
pushed
on
with
the
cavalry
and
by
an
ingenious
stratagem
made
the
french
believe
that
his
infantry
were
still
close
on
them
and
scared
them
from
every
spot
where
they
attempted
to
pause
and
rest
he
mounted
one
of
his
drummers
on
a
horse
which
had
been
taken
from
the
captured
carriage
of
napoleon
and
made
him
ride
along
with
the
pursuing
cavalry
and
beat
the
drum
whenever
they
came
on
any
large
number
of
the
french
the
french
thus
fled
and
the
prussians
pursued
through
quatre
bras
and
even
over
the
heights
of
frasne
and
when
at
length
gneisenau
drew
bridle
and
halted

along

the

take
the

do
not
lose

such
was
his
order

i
strove
to
obey
after
all
the
agitation
and
the
incessant
din
of
a
long
day
of
battle
how
imposing
was
the
stillness
of
that
night
we
proceeded
on
our
sad
and
lonely
march
we
were
a
prey
to
the
most
cruel
reflections
we
were
humiliated
we
were
hopeless
but
not
a
word
of
complaint
was
heard
we
walked
silently
as
a
troop
of
mourners
and
it
might
have
been
said
that
we
were
attending
the
funeral
of
our
country
glory
suddenly
the
stillness
was
broken
by
a
challenge
vive
it
you
general
come
nearer
to
us
at
that
moment
we
were
passing
over
a
little
hillock
at
the
foot
of
which
was
a
hut
in
which
kellerman
and
some
of
his
officers
had
halted
they
came
out
to
join
as
foy
said
to
me
knows
the
country
he
has
been
along
here
before
with
his
cavalry
we
had
better
follow
him
but
we
found
that
the
direction
which
kellerman
chose
was
towards
the
first
light
towards
genappe
that
led
to
the
causeway
which
our
general
rightly
wished
to
avoid
i
went
to
the
left
to
reconnoitre
and
was
soon
convinced
that
such
was
the
case
it
was
then
that
i
was
able
to
form
a
full
idea
of
the
disorder
of
a
routed
army
what
a
hideous
spectacle
the
mountain
torrent
that
uproots
and
whirls
along
with
it
every
momentary
obstacle
is
a
feeble
image
of
that
heap
of
men
of
horses
of
equipages
rushing
one
upon
another
gathering
before
the
least
obstacle
which
dams
up
their
way
for
a
few
seconds
only
to
form
a
mass
which
overthrows
everything
in
the
path
which
it
forces
for
itself
woe
to
him
whose
footing
failed
him
in
that
deluge
he
was
crushed
trampled
to
death
i
returned
and
told
my
general
what
i
had
seen
and
he
instantly
abandoned
kellerman
and
resumed
his
original
line
of
march
keeping
straight
across
the
country
over
fields
and
the
rough
thickets
we
at
last
arrived
at
the
bois
de
bossu
where
we
halted
my
general
said
to
me
to
the
farm
of
quatre
bras
and
announce
that
we
are
here
the
emperor
or
soult
must
be
there
ask
for
orders
and
recollect
that
i
am
waiting
here
for
you
the
lives
of
these
men
depend
on
your
exactness
to
reach
the
farm
i
was
obliged
to
cross
the
high
road
i
was
on
horseback
but
nevertheless
was
borne
away
by
the
crowd
that
fled
along
the
road
and
it
was
long
are
i
could
extricate
myself
and
reach
the
farmhouse
general
lobau
was
there
with
his
staff
resting
in
fancied
security
they
thought
that
their
troops
had
halted
there
but
though
a
halt
had
been
attempted
the
men
had
soon
fled
forwards
like
their
comrades
of
the
rest
of
the
army
the
shots
of
the
approaching
prussians
were
now
heard
and
i
believe
that
general
lobau
was
taken
prisoner
in
that
farmhouse
i
left
him
to
rejoin
my
general
which
i
did
with
difficulty
i
found
him
alone
his
men
as
they
came
near
the
current
of
flight
were
infected
with
the
general
panic
and
fled
also
what
was
to
be
done
follow
that
crowd
of
runaways
general
foy
would
not
hear
of
it
there
were
five
of
us
still
with
him
all
officers
he
had
been
wounded
at
about
five
in
the
afternoon
and
the
wound
had
not
been
dressed
he
suffered
severely
but
his
moral
courage
was
unbroken
us
keep
he
said
line
parallel
to
the
high
road
and
work
our
way
hence
as
we
best
can
a
was
before
us
and
we
followed
it
the
moon
shone
out
brightly
and
revealed
the
full
wretchedness
of
the
tableau
which
met
our
eyes
a
brigadier
and
four
cavalry
soldiers
whom
we
met
with
formed
our
escort
we
marched
on
and
as
the
noise
grew
more
distant
i
thought
that
we
were
losing
the
parallel
of
the
highway
finding
that
we
had
the
moon
more
and
more
on
the
left
i
felt
sure
of
this
and
mentioned
it
to
the
general
absorbed
in
thought
he
made
me
no
reply
we
came
in
front
of
a
windmill
and
endeavoured
to
procure
some
information
but
we
could
not
gain
an
entrance
or
make
any
one
answer
and
we
continued
our
nocturnal
march
at
last
we
entered
a
village
but
found
every
door
closed
against
us
and
were
obliged
to
use
threats
in
order
to
gain
admission
into
a
single
house
the
poor
woman
to
whom
it
belonged
more
dead
than
alive
received
us
as
if
we
had
been
enemies
before
asking
where
we
were
give
as
some
food
was
our
cry
bread
and
butter
and
beer
were
brought
and
soon
disappeared
before
men
who
had
fasted
for
hours
a
little
revived
we
ask
are
we
what
is
the
name
of
this
village
on
looking
at
the
map
i
saw
that
in
coming
to
that
village
we
had
leaned
too
much
to
the
right
and
that
we
were
in
the
direction
of
mons
in
order
to
reach
the
sambre
at
the
bridge
of
marchiennes
we
had
four
leagues
to
traverse
and
there
was
scarcely
time
to
march
the
distance
before
daybreak
i
made
a
villager
act
as
our
guide
and
bound
him
by
his
arm
to
my
stirrup
he
led
us
through
roux
to
marchiennes
the
poor
fellow
ran
alongside
of
my
horse
the
whole
way
it
was
cruel
but
necessary
to
compel
him
for
we
had
not
an
instant
to
spare
at
six
in
the
morning
we
entered
marchiennes
marshal
ney
was
there
our
general
went
to
see
him
and
to
ask
what
orders
he
had
to
give
ney
was
asleep
and
rather
than
rob
him
of
the
first
repose
he
had
had
for
four
days
our
general
returned
to
us
without
seeing
him
and
indeed
what
orders
could
marshal
ney
have
given
the
whole
army
was
crossing
the
sambre
each
man
where
and
now
he
chose
some
at
charleroi
some
at
marchiennes
we
were
about
to
do
the
same
thing
when
once
beyond
the
sambre
we
might
safely
halt
and
both
men
and
horses
were
in
extreme
need
of
rest
we
passed
through
thuin
and
finding
a
little
copse
near
the
road
we
gladly
sought
its
shelter
while
our
horses
grazed
we
lay
down
and
slept
how
sweet
was
that
sleep
after
the
fatigues
of
the
long
day
of
battle
and
after
the
night
of
retreat
more
painful
still
we
rested
in
the
little
copse
till
noon
and
sate
there
watching
the
wrecks
of
our
army
defile
along
the
road
before
us
it
was
a
sight
yet
the
different
arms
of
the
service
had
resumed
a
certain
degree
of
order
amid
their
disorder
and
our
general
feeling
his
strength
revive
resolved
to
follow
a
strong
column
of
cavalry
which
was
taking
the
direction
of
beaumont
about
four
leagues
off
we
drew
near
beaumont
when
suddenly
a
regiment
of
horse
was
seen
debouching
from
a
wood
on
our
left
the
column
that
we
followed
shouted
out
prussians
the
prussians
and
galloped
off
in
utter
disorder
the
troops
that
thus
alarmed
them
were
not
a
tenth
part
of
their
number
and
were
in
reality
our
own
hussars
who
wore
green
uniforms
but
the
panic
had
been
brought
even
thus
far
from
the
and
the
disorganized
column
galloped
into
beaumont
which
was
already
crowded
with
our
infantry
we
were
obliged
to
follow
that
debacle
on
entering
beaumont
we
chose
a
house
of
superior
appearance
and
demanded
of
the
mistress
of
it
refreshments
for
the
general
said
the
lady
is
the
tenth
general
who
has
been
to
this
house
since
this
morning
i
have
nothing
left
search
if
you
please
and
see
though
unable
to
find
food
for
the
general
i
persuaded
him
to
take
his
coat
off
and
let
me
examine
his
wound
the
bullet
had
gone
through
the
twists
of
the
left
epaulette
and
penetrating
the
skin
had
run
round
the
shoulder
without
injuring
the
bone
the
lady
of
the
house
made
some
lint
for
me
and
without
any
great
degree
of
surgical
skill
i
succeeded
in
dressing
the
wound
being
still
anxious
to
procure
some
food
for
the
general
and
ourselves
if
it
were
but
a
loaf
of
ammunition
bread
i
left
the
house
and
rode
out
into
the
town
i
saw
pillage
going
on
in
every
direction
open
caissons
stripped
and
blocked
up
the
streets
the
pavement
was
covered
with
plundered
and
torn
baggage
pillagers
and
runaways
such
were
all
the
comrades
i
met
with
disgusted
at
them
i
strove
sword
in
hand
to
stop
one
of
the
plunderers
but
more
active
than
i
he
gave
me
a
bayonet
stab
in
my
left
arm
in
which
i
fortunately
caught
his
thrust
which
had
been
aimed
full
at
my
body
he
disappeared
among
the
crowd
through
which
i
could
not
force
my
horse
my
spirit
of
discipline
had
made
me
forget
that
in
such
circumstances
the
soldier
is
a
mere
wild
beast
but
to
be
wounded
by
a
after
having
passed
unharmed
through
all
the
perils
of
quatre
bras
and
waterloo
this
did
seem
hard
indeed
i
was
trying
to
return
to
general
foy
when
another
horde
of
flyers
burst
into
beaumont
swept
me
into
the
current
of
their
flight
and
hurried
me
out
of
the
town
with
them
until
i
received
my
wound
i
had
preserved
my
moral
courage
in
full
force
but
now
worn
out
with
fatigue
covered
with
blood
and
suffering
severe
pain
from
the
wound
i
own
that
i
gave
way
to
the
general
demoralisation
and
let
myself
be
inertly
borne
along
with
the
rushing
mass
at
last
i
reached
landrecies
though
i
know
not
how
or
when
but
i
found
there
our
colonel
hurday
who
had
been
left
behind
there
in
consequence
of
an
accidental
injury
from
a
carriage
he
took
me
with
him
to
paris
where
i
retired
amid
my
family
and
got
cured
of
my
wound
knowing
nothing
of
the
rest
of
political
and
military
events
that
were
taking
place
no
returns
ever
were
made
of
the
amount
of
the
french
loss
in
the
battle
of
waterloo
but
it
must
have
been
immense
and
may
be
partially
judged
of
by
the
amount
of
killed
and
wounded
in
the
armies
of
the
conquerors
on
this
subject
both
the
prussian
and
british
official
evidence
is
unquestionably
full
and
authentic
the
figures
are
terribly
emphatic
of
the
army
that
fought
under
the
duke
of
wellington
nearly
men
were
killed
and
wounded
on
this
single
day
of
battle
seven
thousand
prussians
also
fell
at
waterloo
at
such
a
fearful
price
was
the
deliverance
of
europe
purchased
by
none
was
the
severity
of
that
loss
more
keenly
felt
than
by
our
great
deliverer
himself
as
may
be
seen
in
major
macready
narrative
the
duke
while
the
battle
was
raging
betrayed
no
sign
of
emotion
at
the
most
ghastly
casualties
but
when
all
was
over
the
sight
of
the
carnage
with
which
the
field
was
covered
and
still
more
the
sickening
spectacle
of
the
agonies
of
the
wounded
men
who
lay
moaning
in
their
misery
by
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
weighed
heavily
on
the
spirit
of
the
victor
as
he
rode
back
across
the
scene
of
strife
on
reaching
his
in
the
village
of
waterloo
the
duke
inquired
anxiously
after
the
numerous
friends
who
had
been
round
him
in
the
morning
and
to
whom
he
was
warmly
attached
many
he
was
told
were
dead
others
were
lying
alive
but
mangled
and
suffering
in
the
houses
round
him
it
is
in
our
hero
own
words
alone
that
his
feelings
can
be
adequately
told
in
a
letter
written
by
him
almost
immediately
after
his
return
from
the
field
he
thus
expressed
himself
my
heart
is
broken
by
the
terrible
loss
i
have
sustained
in
my
old
friends
and
companions
and
my
poor
soldiers
believe
me
nothing
except
a
battle
lost
can
be
half
so
melancholy
as
a
battle
won
the
bravery
of
my
troops
has
hitherto
saved
me
from
the
greater
evil
but
to
win
such
a
battle
as
this
of
waterloo
at
the
expense
of
so
many
gallant
friends
could
only
be
termed
a
heavy
misfortune
but
for
the
result
to
the
public
it
is
not
often
that
a
successful
general
in
modern
warfare
is
called
on
like
the
victorious
commander
of
the
ancient
greek
armies
to
award
a
prize
of
superior
valour
to
one
of
his
soldiers
such
was
to
some
extent
the
case
with
respect
to
the
battle
of
waterloo
in
the
august
of
an
english
clergyman
offered
to
confer
a
small
annuity
on
some
waterloo
soldier
to
be
named
by
the
duke
siborne
vol
p
the
duke
requested
sir
john
byng
to
choose
a
man
from
the
brigade
of
guards
which
had
so
highly
distinguished
itself
in
the
defence
of
hougoumont
there
were
many
gallant
candidates
but
the
election
fell
on
sergeant
james
graham
of
the
light
company
of
the
coldstreams
this
brave
man
had
signalised
himself
throughout
the
day
in
the
defence
of
that
important
post
and
especially
in
the
critical
struggle
that
took
place
at
the
period
when
the
french
who
had
gained
the
wood
the
orchard
and
detached
garden
succeeded
in
bursting
open
a
gate
of
the
courtyard
of
the
chateau
itself
and
rushed
in
in
large
masses
confident
of
carrying
all
before
them
a
fight
of
the
most
desperate
character
was
kept
up
between
them
and
the
guards
for
a
few
minutes
but
at
last
the
british
bayonets
prevailed
nearly
all
the
frenchmen
who
had
forced
their
way
in
were
killed
on
the
spot
and
as
the
few
survivors
ran
back
five
of
the
guards
colonel
macdonnell
captain
wyndham
ensign
gooch
ensign
hervey
and
sergeant
graham
by
sheer
strength
closed
the
gate
again
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
french
from
without
and
effectually
barricaded
it
against
further
assaults
over
and
through
the
loopholed
wall
of
the
courtyard
the
english
garrison
now
kept
up
a
deadly
fire
of
musketry
which
was
fiercely
answered
by
the
french
who
swarmed
round
the
curtilage
like
ravening
wolves
shells
too
from
their
batteries
were
falling
fast
into
the
besieged
place
one
of
which
set
part
of
the
mansion
and
some
of
the
on
fire
graham
who
was
at
this
time
standing
near
colonel
macdonnell
at
the
wall
and
who
had
shown
the
most
perfect
steadiness
and
courage
now
asked
permission
of
his
commanding
officer
to
retire
for
a
moment
macdonnell
replied
by
all
means
graham
but
i
wonder
you
should
ask
leave
now
graham
answered
i
would
not
sir
only
my
brother
is
wounded
and
he
is
in
that
there
which
has
just
caught
fire
laying
down
his
musket
graham
ran
to
the
blazing
spot
lifted
up
his
brother
and
laid
him
in
a
ditch
then
he
was
back
at
his
post
and
was
plying
his
musket
against
the
french
again
before
his
absence
was
noticed
except
by
his
colonel
many
anecdotes
of
individual
prowess
have
been
preserved
but
of
all
the
brave
men
who
were
in
the
british
army
on
that
eventful
day
none
deserve
more
honour
for
courage
and
indomitable
resolution
than
sir
thomas
picton
who
as
has
been
mentioned
fell
in
repulsing
the
great
attack
of
the
french
upon
the
british
left
centre
it
was
not
until
the
dead
body
was
examined
after
the
battle
that
the
full
heroism
of
picton
was
discerned
he
had
been
wounded
on
the
at
quatre
bras
by
a
which
had
broken
two
of
his
ribs
and
caused
also
severe
internal
injuries
but
he
had
concealed
the
circumstance
evidently
in
expectation
that
another
and
greater
battle
would
be
fought
in
a
short
time
and
desirous
to
avoid
being
solicited
to
absent
himself
from
the
field
his
body
was
blackened
and
swollen
by
the
wound
which
must
have
caused
severe
and
incessant
pain
and
it
was
marvellous
how
his
spirit
had
borne
him
up
and
enabled
him
to
take
part
in
the
fatigues
and
duties
of
the
field
the
bullet
which
on
the
killed
the
renowned
loader
of
the
fighting
division
of
the
peninsula
entered
the
head
near
the
left
temple
and
passed
through
the
brain
so
that
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
one
of
the
most
interesting
narratives
of
personal
adventure
at
waterloo
is
that
of
colonel
frederick
ponsonby
of
the
light
dragoons
who
was
severely
wounded
when
vandeleur
brigade
to
which
he
belonged
attacked
the
french
lancers
in
order
to
bring
off
the
union
brigade
which
was
retiring
from
its
memorable
charge
see
supra
the
like
those
whom
they
rescued
advanced
much
further
against
the
french
position
than
prudence
warranted
ponsonby
with
many
others
was
speared
by
a
reserve
of
polish
lancers
and
left
for
dead
on
the
field
it
is
well
to
refer
to
the
description
of
what
he
suffered
as
he
afterwards
gave
it
when
almost
miraculously
recovered
from
his
numerous
wounds
because
his
fate
or
worse
was
the
fate
of
thousands
more
and
because
the
narrative
of
the
pangs
of
an
individual
with
whom
we
can
identify
ourselves
always
comes
more
home
to
us
than
a
general
description
of
the
miseries
of
whole
masses
his
tale
may
make
us
remember
what
are
the
horrors
of
war
as
well
as
its
glories
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
operations
which
he
refers
to
took
place
about
three
in
the
day
and
that
the
fighting
went
on
for
at
least
five
hours
more
after
describing
how
he
and
his
men
charged
through
the
french
whom
they
first
encountered
and
went
against
other
enemies
he
states
we
had
no
sooner
passed
them
than
we
were
ourselves
attacked
before
we
could
form
by
about
polish
lancers
who
had
hastened
to
their
relief
the
french
artillery
pouring
in
among
us
a
heavy
fire
of
grape
though
for
one
of
our
men
they
killed
three
of
their
own
in
the
melee
i
was
almost
instantly
disabled
in
both
arms
losing
first
my
sword
and
then
my
reins
and
followed
by
a
few
men
who
were
presently
cut
down
no
quarter
being
allowed
asked
or
given
i
was
carried
along
by
my
horse
till
receiving
a
blow
from
a
sabre
i
fell
senseless
on
my
face
to
the
ground
recovering
i
raised
myself
a
little
to
look
round
being
at
that
time
i
believe
in
a
condition
to
get
up
and
run
away
when
a
lancer
passing
by
cried
out
pas
mort
coquin
and
struck
his
lance
through
my
back
my
head
dropped
the
blood
gushed
into
my
mouth
a
difficulty
of
breathing
came
on
and
i
thought
all
was
over
not
long
afterwards
it
was
impossible
to
measure
time
but
i
must
have
fallen
in
less
than
ten
minutes
after
the
onset
a
tirailleur
stopped
to
plunder
me
threatening
my
life
i
directed
him
to
a
small
in
which
he
found
three
dollars
all
i
had
but
he
continued
to
threaten
and
i
said
he
might
search
me
this
he
did
immediately
unloosing
my
stock
and
tearing
open
my
waistcoat
and
leaving
me
in
a
very
uneasy
posture
but
he
was
no
sooner
gone
than
an
officer
bringing
up
some
troops
to
which
probably
the
tirailleur
belonged
and
happening
to
halt
where
i
lay
stooped
down
and
addressed
me
saying
he
feared
i
was
badly
wounded
i
said
that
i
was
and
expressed
a
wish
to
be
removed
to
the
rear
he
said
it
was
against
their
orders
to
remove
even
their
own
men
but
that
if
they
gained
the
day
and
he
understood
that
the
duke
of
wellington
was
killed
and
that
some
of
our
battalions
had
surrendered
every
attention
in
his
power
would
be
shown
me
i
complained
of
thirst
and
he
held
his
to
my
lips
directing
one
of
the
soldiers
to
lay
me
straight
on
my
side
and
place
a
knapsack
under
my
head
he
then
passed
on
into
action
soon
perhaps
to
want
though
not
receive
the
same
assistance
and
i
shall
never
know
to
whose
generosity
i
was
indebted
as
i
believe
for
my
life
of
what
rank
he
was
i
can
not
say
he
wore
a
great
coat
another
tirailleur
came
up
a
fine
young
man
full
of
ardour
he
knelt
down
and
fired
over
me
loading
and
firing
many
times
and
conversing
with
me
all
the
while
the
frenchman
with
strange
coolness
informed
ponsonby
of
how
he
was
shooting
and
what
he
thought
of
the
progress
of
the
battle
at
last
he
ran
off
exclaiming
will
probably
not
be
sorry
to
hear
that
we
are
going
to
retreat
good
day
my
friend
it
was
dusk
ponsonby
adds
when
two
squadrons
of
prussian
cavalry
each
of
them
two
deep
came
across
the
valley
and
passed
over
me
in
full
trot
lifting
me
from
the
ground
and
tumbling
me
about
cruelly
the
clatter
of
of
their
approach
and
the
apprehensions
they
excited
may
be
imagined
a
gun
taking
that
direction
must
have
destroyed
me
the
battle
was
now
at
an
end
or
removed
to
a
distance
the
shouts
the
imprecations
the
outcries
of
the
discharge
of
musketry
and
cannon
were
over
and
the
groans
of
the
wounded
all
around
me
became
every
moment
more
and
more
audible
i
thought
the
night
would
never
end
much
about
this
time
i
found
a
soldier
of
the
royals
lying
across
my
legs
he
had
probably
crawled
thither
in
his
agony
and
his
weight
his
convulsive
motions
and
the
air
issuing
through
a
wound
in
his
side
distressed
me
greatly
the
last
circumstance
most
of
all
as
i
had
a
wound
of
the
same
nature
myself
it
was
not
a
dark
night
and
the
prussians
were
wandering
about
to
plunder
the
scene
in
ferdinand
count
fathom
came
into
my
mind
though
no
women
appeared
several
stragglers
looked
at
me
as
they
passed
by
one
after
another
and
at
last
one
of
them
stopped
to
examine
me
i
told
him
as
well
as
i
could
for
i
spoke
german
very
imperfectly
that
i
was
a
british
officer
and
had
been
plundered
already
he
did
not
desist
however
and
pulled
me
about
roughly
an
hour
before
midnight
i
saw
a
man
in
an
english
uniform
walking
towards
me
he
was
i
suspect
on
the
same
errand
and
he
came
and
looked
in
my
face
i
spoke
instantly
telling
him
who
i
was
and
assuring
him
of
a
reward
if
he
would
remain
by
me
he
said
he
belonged
to
the
and
had
missed
his
regiment
he
released
me
from
the
dying
soldier
and
being
unarmed
took
up
a
sword
from
the
ground
and
stood
over
me
pacing
backwards
and
forwards
day
broke
and
at
six
in
the
morning
some
english
were
seen
at
a
distance
and
he
ran
to
them
a
messenger
being
sent
off
to
hervey
a
cart
came
for
me
and
i
was
placed
in
it
and
carried
to
the
village
of
waterloo
a
mile
and
a
half
off
and
laid
in
the
bed
from
which
as
i
understood
afterwards
gordon
had
been
just
carried
out
i
had
received
seven
wounds
a
surgeon
slept
in
my
room
and
i
was
saved
by
excessive
bleeding
major
macready
in
the
journal
already
cited
see
supra
p
justly
praises
the
deep
devotion
to
their
emperor
which
marked
the
french
at
waterloo
never
indeed
had
the
national
bravery
of
the
french
people
been
more
nobly
shown
one
soldier
in
the
french
ranks
was
seen
when
his
arm
was
shattered
by
a
to
wrench
it
off
with
the
other
and
throwing
it
up
in
the
air
he
exclaimed
to
his
comrades
vive
la
mort
colonel
mentions
in
his
memoirs
page
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
a
french
soldier
who
had
had
both
legs
carried
off
by
a
was
borne
past
the
front
of
foy
division
and
called
out
to
them
ca
rien
camarades
vive
gloire
a
la
france
the
same
officer
at
the
end
of
the
battle
when
all
hope
was
lost
tells
us
that
he
saw
a
french
grenadier
blackened
with
powder
and
with
his
clothes
torn
and
stained
leaning
on
his
musket
and
immoveable
as
a
statue
the
colonel
called
to
him
to
join
his
comrades
and
retreat
but
the
grenadier
showed
him
his
musket
and
his
hands
and
said
these
hands
have
with
this
musket
used
more
than
twenty
packets
of
cartridges
it
was
more
than
my
share
i
supplied
myself
with
ammunition
from
the
dead
leave
me
to
die
here
on
the
field
of
battle
it
is
not
courage
that
fails
me
but
strength
then
as
colonel
delafosse
left
him
the
soldier
stretched
himself
on
the
ground
to
meet
his
fate
exclaiming
tout
est
perdu
pauvre
france
the
gallantry
of
the
french
officers
at
least
equalled
that
of
their
men
ney
in
particular
set
the
example
of
the
most
daring
courage
here
as
in
every
french
army
in
which
he
ever
served
or
commanded
he
was
le
brave
des
braves
throughout
the
day
he
was
in
the
front
of
the
battle
and
was
one
of
the
very
last
frenchmen
who
quitted
the
field
his
horse
was
killed
under
him
in
the
last
attack
made
on
the
english
position
but
he
was
seen
on
foot
his
clothes
torn
with
bullets
his
face
smirched
with
powder
striving
sword
in
hand
first
to
urge
his
men
forward
and
at
last
to
check
their
flight
there
was
another
brave
general
of
the
french
army
whose
valour
and
good
conduct
on
that
day
of
disaster
to
his
nation
should
never
be
unnoticed
when
the
story
of
waterloo
is
recounted
this
was
general
polet
who
about
seven
in
the
evening
led
the
first
battalion
of
the
regiment
of
the
chasseurs
of
the
guard
to
the
defence
of
planchenoit
and
on
whom
napoleon
personally
urged
the
deep
importance
of
maintaining
possession
of
that
village
pelet
and
his
men
took
their
post
in
the
central
part
of
the
village
and
occupied
the
church
and
churchyard
in
great
strength
there
they
repelled
every
assault
of
the
prussians
who
in
rapidly
increasing
numbers
rushed
forward
with
infuriated
pertinacity
they
held
their
post
till
the
utter
rout
of
the
main
army
of
their
comrades
was
apparent
and
the
victorious
allies
were
thronging
around
planchenoit
when
pelet
and
his
brave
chasseurs
quitted
the
churchyard
and
retired
with
steady
march
though
they
suffered
fearfully
from
the
moment
they
left
their
shelter
and
prussian
cavalry
as
well
as
infantry
dashed
fiercely
after
them
pelet
kept
together
a
little
knot
of
veterans
and
had
the
eagle
covered
over
and
borne
along
in
the
midst
of
them
at
one
time
the
inequality
of
the
ground
caused
his
ranks
to
open
a
little
and
in
an
instant
the
prussian
horseman
were
on
them
and
striving
to
capture
the
eagle
captain
siborne
relates
the
conduct
of
pelet
with
the
admiration
worthy
of
one
brave
soldier
for
another
pelet
taking
advantage
of
a
spot
of
ground
which
afforded
them
some
degree
of
cover
against
the
fire
of
grape
by
which
they
were
constantly
assailed
halted
the
and
called
out
a
moi
chasseurs
sauvons
ou
mourons
autour
the
chasseurs
immediately
pressed
around
him
forming
what
is
usually
termed
the
rallying
square
and
lowering
their
bayonets
succeeded
in
repulsing
the
charge
of
cavalry
some
guns
were
then
brought
to
bear
upon
them
and
subsequently
a
brisk
fire
of
musketry
but
notwithstanding
the
awful
sacrifice
which
was
thus
offered
up
in
defence
of
their
precious
charge
they
succeeded
in
reaching
the
main
line
of
retreat
favoured
by
the
universal
confusion
as
also
by
the
general
obscurity
which
now
prevailed
and
thus
saved
alike
the
eagle
and
the
honour
of
the
regiment
french
writers
do
injustice
to
their
own
army
and
general
when
they
revive
malignant
calumnies
against
wellington
and
speak
of
his
having
blundered
into
victory
no
blunderer
could
have
successfully
encountered
such
troops
as
those
of
napoleon
and
under
such
a
leader
it
is
superfluous
to
cite
against
these
cavils
the
testimony
which
other
continental
critics
have
borne
to
the
high
military
genius
of
our
illustrious
chief
i
refer
to
one
only
which
is
of
peculiar
value
on
account
of
the
quarter
whence
it
comes
it
is
that
of
the
great
german
writer
niebuhr
whose
accurate
acquaintance
with
every
important
scene
of
modern
as
well
as
ancient
history
was
unparalleled
and
who
was
no
mere
pedant
but
a
man
practically
versed
in
active
life
and
had
been
personally
acquainted
with
most
of
the
leading
men
in
the
great
events
of
the
early
part
of
this
century
niebuhr
in
the
passage
which
i
allude
to
roman
history
vol
p
after
referring
to
the
military
blunders
of
mithridates
frederick
the
great
napoleon
pyrrhus
and
hannibal
uses
these
remarkable
words
the
duke
of
wellington
is
i
believe
the
only
general
in
whose
conduct
of
war
we
can
not
discover
any
important
mistake
not
that
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
the
duke
merits
were
simply
of
a
negative
order
or
that
he
was
merely
a
cautious
phlegmatic
general
fit
only
for
defensive
warfare
as
some
recent
french
historians
have
described
him
on
the
contrary
he
was
bold
even
to
audacity
when
boldness
was
required
the
intrepid
advance
and
fight
at
assaye
the
crossing
of
the
douro
and
the
movement
on
talavera
in
the
advance
to
madrid
and
burgos
in
the
actions
before
bayonne
in
and
the
desperate
stand
made
at
waterloo
itself
when
more
generals
would
have
retreated
beyond
brussels
place
this
beyond
a
doubt
see
the
admirable
parallel
of
wellington
and
marlborough
at
the
end
of
sir
archibald
alison
life
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
sir
archibald
justly
considers
wellington
the
more
daring
general
of
the
two
the
overthrow
of
the
french
military
power
at
waterloo
was
so
complete
that
the
subsequent
events
of
the
brief
campaign
have
little
interest
lamartine
truly
says
this
defeat
left
nothing
undecided
in
future
events
for
victory
had
given
judgment
the
war
began
and
ended
in
a
single
battle
napoleon
himself
recognised
instantly
and
fully
the
deadly
nature
of
the
blow
which
had
been
dealt
to
his
empire
in
his
flight
from
the
he
first
halted
at
charleroi
but
the
approach
of
the
pursuing
prussians
drove
him
thence
before
he
had
rested
there
an
hour
with
difficulty
getting
clear
of
the
wrecks
of
his
own
army
he
reached
philippeville
where
he
remained
a
few
hours
and
sent
orders
to
the
french
generals
in
the
various
extremities
of
france
to
converge
with
their
troops
upon
paris
he
ordered
soult
to
collect
the
fugitives
of
his
own
force
and
lead
them
to
laon
he
then
hurried
forward
to
paris
and
reached
his
capital
before
the
news
of
his
own
defeat
but
the
stern
truth
soon
transpired
at
the
demand
of
the
chambers
of
peers
and
representatives
he
abandoned
the
throne
by
a
second
and
final
abdication
on
the
of
june
on
the
of
june
he
left
the
neighbourhood
of
paris
and
proceeded
to
rochefort
in
the
hope
of
escaping
to
america
but
the
coast
was
strictly
watched
and
on
the
of
july
the
surrendered
himself
on
board
of
the
english
the
bellerophon
meanwhile
the
allied
armies
had
advanced
steadily
upon
paris
driving
before
them
grouchy
corps
and
the
scanty
force
which
soult
had
succeeded
in
rallying
at
laon
cambray
peronne
and
other
fortresses
were
speedily
captured
and
by
the
of
june
the
invaders
were
taking
their
positions
in
front
of
paris
the
provisional
government
which
acted
in
the
french
capital
after
the
emperor
abdication
opened
negotiations
with
the
allied
chiefs
blucher
in
his
quenchless
hatred
of
the
french
was
eager
to
reject
all
proposals
for
a
suspension
of
hostilities
and
to
assault
and
storm
the
city
but
the
sager
and
calmer
spirit
of
wellington
prevailed
over
his
colleague
the
entreated
armistice
was
granted
and
on
the
of
july
the
capitulation
of
paris
terminated
the
war
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
in
closing
our
observations
on
this
the
last
of
the
decisive
battles
of
the
world
it
is
pleasing
to
contrast
the
year
which
it
signalized
with
the
year
that
is
now
written
in
june
passing
over
our
heads
we
have
not
and
long
may
we
be
without
the
stern
excitement
of
martial
strife
and
we
see
no
captive
standards
of
our
european
neighbours
brought
in
triumph
to
our
shrines
but
we
behold
an
infinitely
prouder
spectacle
we
see
the
banners
of
every
civilized
nation
waving
over
the
arena
of
our
competition
with
each
other
in
the
arts
that
minister
to
our
race
support
and
happiness
and
