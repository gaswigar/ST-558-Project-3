chapter
i
the
happiness
of
stephen
the
smith
stephen
stephen
stephen
the
impatient
cry
was
heard
through
all
the
narrow
gloomy
street
where
the
old
bowed
to
meet
one
another
and
left
for
the
eye
comfort
only
a
bare
glimpse
of
blue
it
was
men
said
the
oldest
street
in
strelsau
even
as
the
sign
of
the
silver
ship
was
the
oldest
sign
known
to
exist
in
the
city
for
when
aaron
lazarus
the
jew
came
there
seventy
years
before
he
had
been
the
tenth
man
in
unbroken
line
that
took
up
the
business
and
now
stephen
nados
his
apprentice
and
successor
was
the
eleventh
old
lazarus
had
made
a
great
business
of
it
and
had
spent
his
savings
in
buying
up
the
better
part
of
the
street
but
since
jews
then
might
hold
no
property
in
strelsau
he
had
taken
all
the
deeds
in
the
name
of
stephen
nados
and
when
he
came
to
die
being
unable
to
carry
his
houses
or
his
money
with
him
having
no
kindred
and
caring
not
a
straw
for
any
man
or
woman
alive
save
stephen
he
bade
stephen
let
the
deeds
be
and
with
a
last
curse
against
the
christians
of
whom
stephen
was
one
and
a
devout
one
he
kissed
the
young
man
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
died
therefore
stephen
was
a
rich
man
and
had
no
need
to
carry
on
the
business
though
it
never
entered
his
mind
to
do
anything
else
for
half
the
people
who
raised
their
heads
at
the
sound
of
the
cry
were
stephen
tenants
and
paid
him
rent
when
he
asked
for
it
a
thing
he
did
when
he
chanced
to
remember
and
could
tear
himself
away
from
chasing
a
goblet
or
fashioning
a
little
silver
saint
for
stephen
loved
his
craft
more
than
his
rents
therefore
again
he
was
well
liked
in
the
quarter
stephen
stephen
cried
prince
henry
impatiently
hammering
on
the
closed
door
with
his
whip
plague
take
the
man
is
he
dead
the
men
in
the
quarter
went
on
with
their
work
the
women
moved
idly
to
the
doors
the
girls
came
out
into
the
street
and
clustered
here
and
there
looking
at
the
prince
for
although
he
was
not
so
handsome
as
that
scamp
rudolf
his
brother
who
had
just
come
back
from
his
travels
with
half
a
dozen
wild
stories
spurring
after
him
yet
henry
was
a
comely
youth
as
he
sat
on
his
chestnut
mare
with
his
blue
eyes
full
of
impatience
and
his
chestnut
curls
fringing
his
shoulders
so
the
girls
clustered
and
looked
moreover
stephen
the
smith
must
come
soon
and
the
sight
of
him
was
worth
a
moment
waiting
for
he
buried
himself
all
day
in
his
workshop
and
no
laughing
challenge
could
lure
him
out
though
in
truth
said
one
of
the
girls
tossing
her
head
thankless
work
to
spend
a
glance
on
either
for
they
do
not
return
it
now
when
rudolf
comes
she
broke
off
with
a
laugh
and
her
comrades
joined
in
it
rudolf
left
no
debts
of
that
sort
unpaid
however
deep
he
might
be
in
the
books
of
stephen
nados
and
of
the
others
who
furnished
his
daily
needs
presently
stephen
came
unbolting
his
door
with
much
deliberation
and
greeting
prince
henry
with
a
restrained
courtesy
he
was
not
very
well
pleased
to
see
his
guest
for
it
was
a
ticklish
moment
with
the
nose
of
saint
peter
and
stephen
would
have
liked
to
finish
the
job
uninterrupted
still
the
prince
was
a
prince
a
gentleman
and
a
friend
and
stephen
would
not
be
uncivil
to
him
you
ride
early
sir
he
observed
patting
the
chestnut
mare
i
have
a
good
reason
answered
henry
the
lion
rages
stephen
put
up
his
hand
to
shelter
his
eyes
from
a
ray
of
sunshine
that
had
evaded
the
nodding
walls
and
crept
in
it
lit
up
his
flaxen
hair
which
he
wore
long
and
in
thick
waves
and
played
in
his
yellow
beard
and
he
looked
very
grave
for
when
the
lion
raged
strange
and
alarming
things
might
happen
in
the
city
of
strelsau
the
stories
of
his
last
fit
of
passion
were
yet
hardly
old
what
has
vexed
the
king
he
asked
for
he
knew
that
prince
henry
spoke
of
his
father
henry
surnamed
the
lion
now
an
old
man
yet
as
fierce
as
when
he
had
been
young
is
it
your
brother
again
for
a
marvel
no
it
is
myself
stephen
and
he
is
more
furious
with
me
than
he
has
ever
been
with
rudolf
aye
even
more
than
he
was
at
all
the
stories
that
followed
my
brother
home
and
what
is
the
cause
of
it
all
sir
and
how
is
it
in
my
power
to
help
that
you
will
find
out
very
soon
said
the
prince
with
a
bitter
laugh
you
will
be
sent
for
to
the
palace
in
an
hour
stephen
if
it
is
about
the
king
ring
the
ring
is
not
finished
said
stephen
it
is
not
about
the
ring
yet
indeed
it
is
in
a
way
about
a
ring
for
you
are
to
be
married
stephen
this
very
day
you
are
to
be
married
i
think
not
sir
said
stephen
mildly
for
it
is
a
thing
that
a
man
himself
hears
about
if
it
be
true
but
the
king
thinks
so
stephen
have
you
remarked
among
my
sister
osra
ladies
a
certain
dark
lady
with
black
hair
and
eyes
i
can
not
describe
her
eyes
but
you
can
tell
me
her
name
sir
suggested
stephen
who
was
a
practical
man
her
name
oh
her
name
is
hilda
hilda
von
lauengram
aye
i
know
the
countess
hilda
i
have
made
a
bracelet
for
her
she
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
alive
cried
prince
henry
in
a
sudden
rapture
and
so
loudly
being
carried
away
by
his
passion
that
the
girls
heard
him
and
wondered
of
whom
he
spoke
with
so
great
an
enthusiasm
to
those
to
whom
she
seems
such
observed
stephen
but
pray
how
am
i
concerned
in
all
this
sir
the
prince
smile
grew
more
bitter
as
he
answered
why
you
are
to
marry
her
it
was
an
idle
suggestion
of
osra
made
in
jest
my
father
is
pleased
to
approve
of
it
in
earnest
then
he
bent
in
his
saddle
and
went
on
in
a
hurried
urgent
whisper
i
love
her
better
than
my
life
stephen
better
than
heaven
and
my
faith
and
word
are
pledged
to
her
and
last
night
i
was
to
have
fled
with
her
for
i
knew
better
than
to
face
the
old
lion
but
osra
found
her
making
preparations
and
we
were
discovered
then
osra
was
scornful
and
the
king
mad
and
rudolf
laughed
and
when
they
talked
of
what
was
to
be
done
to
her
osra
came
in
with
her
laughing
suggestion
it
caught
the
king
angry
fancy
and
he
swore
that
it
should
be
so
and
since
the
archbishop
is
away
he
has
bidden
the
bishop
of
modenstein
be
at
the
palace
at
twelve
and
you
will
be
brought
there
also
and
you
will
be
married
to
her
but
by
heavens
i
have
your
blood
if
you
are
with
this
sudden
outbreak
of
fury
the
prince
ended
yet
a
moment
later
he
put
out
his
hand
to
the
smith
saying
it
not
your
fault
man
that
true
enough
said
the
smith
for
i
have
no
desire
to
marry
her
and
it
is
not
fitting
that
a
lady
of
her
birth
should
mate
with
a
smith
she
is
of
a
great
house
and
she
would
hate
and
despise
me
prince
henry
was
about
to
assent
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
on
stephen
the
smith
now
the
smith
was
a
very
handsome
man
handsomer
many
said
than
prince
rudolf
himself
whom
no
lady
could
look
on
without
admiration
he
stood
six
feet
and
two
inches
in
his
flat
working
shoes
he
was
very
broad
and
could
leap
higher
and
hurl
a
stone
farther
than
any
man
in
strelsau
moreover
he
looked
kind
and
gentle
yet
was
reputed
to
grow
angry
at
times
and
then
to
be
very
dangerous
therefore
prince
henry
knowing
or
thinking
that
he
knew
the
caprices
of
women
and
how
they
are
caught
by
this
and
that
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
terrible
fear
that
the
countess
hilda
might
not
despise
stephen
the
smith
yet
he
did
not
express
his
fear
but
said
that
it
was
an
impossible
thing
that
a
lady
of
the
countess
birth
for
the
house
of
lauengram
was
very
noble
should
wed
a
silversmith
even
though
he
were
as
fine
a
fellow
as
his
good
friend
stephen
to
which
gracious
speech
stephen
made
no
reply
but
stood
very
thoughtful
with
his
hand
on
the
neck
of
the
chestnut
mare
but
at
last
he
said
in
any
case
it
can
not
be
for
i
am
bound
already
a
wife
have
you
a
wife
cried
the
prince
eagerly
no
but
my
heart
is
bound
said
stephen
the
smith
the
king
will
make
little
of
that
yet
who
is
she
is
she
any
of
these
girls
who
stand
looking
at
us
no
she
is
none
of
these
answered
stephen
smiling
as
though
such
an
idea
were
very
ludicrous
and
are
you
pledged
to
her
i
to
her
but
not
she
to
me
but
does
she
love
you
i
think
it
most
unlikely
said
stephen
the
smith
the
lion
will
care
nothing
for
this
groaned
the
prince
despondently
they
will
send
for
you
in
half
an
hour
for
heaven
sake
spare
her
stephen
spare
her
sir
do
not
consent
to
marry
her
however
urgently
the
king
may
command
you
the
smith
shook
his
head
smiling
still
prince
henry
rode
sorrowfully
away
spending
not
a
glance
on
the
bevy
of
girls
who
watched
him
go
and
stephen
turning
into
his
house
shut
the
door
and
with
one
great
sigh
set
to
work
again
on
the
nose
of
saint
peter
for
anyhow
said
he
a
man
can
work
and
after
a
long
pause
he
added
i
never
thought
to
tell
any
one
but
if
i
must
i
must
now
sure
enough
when
the
clock
on
the
cathedral
wanted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
noon
two
of
the
king
guard
came
and
bade
stephen
follow
them
with
all
haste
to
the
palace
and
since
they
were
very
urgent
and
no
time
was
to
be
lost
he
followed
them
as
he
was
in
his
apron
without
washing
his
hands
or
getting
rid
of
the
dust
that
hung
about
him
from
his
work
however
he
had
finished
saint
peter
nose
and
all
had
gone
well
with
it
so
that
he
went
in
a
contented
frame
of
mind
determined
to
tell
the
whole
truth
to
king
henry
the
lion
sooner
than
be
forced
into
a
marriage
with
the
countess
hilda
von
lauengram
the
lion
sat
in
his
great
chair
he
was
a
very
thin
old
man
with
a
face
haggard
and
deeply
lined
his
eyes
set
far
back
in
his
head
glowed
and
glowered
and
his
fingers
pulled
his
sparse
white
beard
on
his
right
prince
rudolf
lolled
on
a
low
seat
smiling
at
the
play
on
his
left
sat
that
wonderfully
fair
lady
the
princess
osra
then
in
the
first
bloom
of
her
young
beauty
and
she
was
smiling
scornfully
prince
henry
stood
before
his
father
and
some
yards
from
him
was
the
countess
hilda
trembling
and
tearful
supported
by
one
of
her
companions
and
finally
since
the
archbishop
was
gone
to
rome
to
get
himself
a
scarlet
hat
the
bishop
of
modenstein
a
young
man
of
noble
family
was
there
most
richly
arrayed
in
choicest
lace
and
handsomest
vestments
ready
to
perform
the
ceremony
prince
rudolf
had
beckoned
the
bishop
near
him
and
was
jesting
with
him
in
an
undertone
the
bishop
laughed
as
a
man
laughs
who
knows
he
should
not
laugh
but
can
not
well
help
himself
for
rudolf
owned
a
pretty
wit
although
it
was
sadly
unrestrained
the
king
fury
having
had
a
night
and
a
morning
to
grow
cool
in
had
now
settled
into
a
cold
ironical
mood
which
argued
no
less
resolution
than
his
first
fierce
wrath
there
was
a
grim
smile
on
his
face
as
he
addressed
the
smith
who
having
bowed
to
the
company
was
standing
between
the
countess
and
prince
henry
the
house
of
elphberg
said
the
king
with
mocking
graciousness
well
recognises
your
worth
stephen
my
friend
we
are
indebted
to
you
it
a
thousand
crowns
or
more
from
prince
rudolf
alone
sire
interrupted
stephen
with
a
bow
to
the
prince
he
named
for
much
faithful
service
pursued
the
king
while
rudolf
laughed
again
i
have
therefore
determined
to
reward
you
with
the
hand
of
a
lady
who
is
it
may
be
above
your
station
but
in
no
way
above
your
worth
behold
her
is
she
not
handsome
on
my
word
i
envy
you
smith
she
is
beautiful
young
you
are
lucky
smith
nay
no
thanks
it
is
but
what
you
deserve
and
no
more
than
she
deserves
take
her
and
be
happy
and
he
ended
with
a
snarling
laugh
as
he
waved
his
lean
veined
hand
towards
the
unhappy
countess
and
fixed
his
sneering
eyes
on
the
face
of
his
son
henry
who
had
turned
pale
as
death
but
neither
spoke
nor
moved
illustration
her
and
be
happy
the
bishop
of
modenstein
he
was
of
the
house
of
hentzau
many
of
which
have
been
famous
in
history
lifted
up
his
hands
in
horror
at
last
whispered
jest
and
then
advancing
with
a
bow
to
the
king
asked
if
he
were
now
to
perform
his
sacred
duties
aye
get
on
with
it
growled
the
lion
not
heeding
the
countess
sobs
or
the
entreaty
in
his
son
face
and
the
princess
osra
sat
unmoved
the
scornful
smile
still
on
her
lips
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
no
pity
for
a
brother
who
could
stoop
or
for
a
girl
who
had
dared
to
soar
too
high
wait
wait
said
stephen
the
smith
does
this
lady
love
me
sire
aye
she
loves
you
enough
for
the
purpose
smith
grinned
the
king
do
not
be
uneasy
may
i
ask
her
if
she
loves
me
sire
why
no
smith
your
king
word
must
be
enough
for
you
and
your
majesty
says
that
she
loves
me
i
do
say
so
smith
then
said
stephen
i
am
very
sorry
for
her
for
as
there
a
heaven
above
us
sire
i
do
not
love
her
prince
rudolf
laughed
osra
smile
broadened
in
greater
scorn
the
countess
hid
her
face
in
her
companion
bosom
the
old
king
roared
out
a
gruff
burst
good
good
he
chuckled
but
it
will
come
with
marriage
smith
for
with
marriage
love
either
comes
or
goes
eh
son
rudolf
and
since
in
this
case
it
can
not
go
you
must
not
doubt
friend
stephen
that
it
will
come
and
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
greatly
amused
that
a
smith
when
offered
the
hand
of
a
countess
should
hesitate
to
take
it
he
had
not
thought
of
so
fine
a
humiliation
as
this
for
the
presumptuous
girl
that
might
well
be
sire
admitted
stephen
were
it
not
that
i
most
passionately
love
another
our
affections
said
the
king
are
unruly
things
smith
and
must
be
kept
in
subjection
is
it
not
so
son
rudolf
it
should
be
so
sire
answered
the
merry
prince
but
the
princess
osra
whose
eyes
had
been
scanning
stephen
figure
here
broke
suddenly
into
the
conversation
are
you
pledged
to
her
whom
you
love
so
passionately
she
asked
i
have
not
ventured
to
tell
her
of
my
love
madame
answered
he
bowing
low
then
there
is
no
harm
done
observed
prince
rudolf
the
harm
lies
in
the
telling
not
in
the
loving
tell
us
something
about
her
commanded
the
princess
and
the
king
who
loved
sport
most
when
it
hurt
others
chimed
in
aye
let
hear
about
her
whom
you
prefer
to
this
lady
in
what
shop
does
she
work
smith
or
does
she
sell
flowers
or
is
she
a
come
listen
countess
and
hear
about
your
rival
prince
henry
took
one
step
forward
in
uncontrolled
anger
but
he
could
not
meet
the
savage
mirth
in
the
old
man
eyes
and
sinking
into
a
chair
spread
his
hand
across
his
face
but
stephen
regarding
the
king
with
placid
began
to
speak
of
her
whom
he
loved
so
passionately
and
his
voice
was
soft
as
he
spoke
she
works
in
no
shop
sire
said
he
nor
does
she
sell
flowers
nor
is
she
a
though
i
would
not
care
if
she
were
but
one
day
when
the
clouds
hung
dark
over
our
street
she
came
riding
down
it
and
another
girl
with
her
the
two
stopped
before
my
door
and
seeing
them
i
came
out
it
is
more
than
you
do
for
me
remarked
prince
rudolf
stephen
smiled
but
continued
his
story
i
came
out
and
she
whom
i
love
gave
me
a
bracelet
to
mend
and
i
looking
at
her
rather
than
at
the
bracelet
said
already
it
is
perfect
but
she
did
not
hear
for
when
she
had
given
me
the
bracelet
she
rode
on
again
at
once
and
took
no
more
notice
of
me
than
of
the
flies
that
were
crawling
up
my
wall
that
was
the
first
and
is
the
last
time
that
i
have
spoken
to
her
until
this
day
but
she
was
so
beautiful
that
there
and
then
i
swore
that
until
i
had
found
means
and
courage
to
tell
her
my
love
and
until
she
had
thrice
refused
it
i
would
marry
no
other
maiden
nor
speak
a
word
of
love
it
seems
to
me
said
prince
rudolf
that
the
oath
has
some
prudence
in
it
for
if
she
prove
obdurate
friend
stephen
you
will
then
be
able
to
go
elsewhere
many
lovers
swear
more
intemperately
but
they
do
not
keep
their
oaths
said
stephen
with
a
shrewd
look
at
the
prince
you
had
best
let
him
alone
my
son
said
the
old
king
he
knows
what
all
the
country
knows
of
its
future
king
then
he
may
go
and
hang
with
all
the
country
said
the
prince
peevishly
but
the
princess
osra
leant
a
little
forward
towards
stephen
and
the
countess
hilda
also
looked
covertly
out
from
the
folds
of
her
dress
at
stephen
and
the
princess
said
was
she
then
so
beautiful
this
girl
as
the
sun
in
heaven
madame
said
the
smith
as
beautiful
as
my
pretty
sister
asked
rudolf
in
careless
jest
yes
as
beautiful
sir
answered
stephen
then
said
the
cruel
old
king
very
much
more
beautiful
than
this
countess
of
that
you
must
ask
your
son
henry
sire
said
stephen
discreetly
nevertheless
said
the
king
you
must
put
up
with
the
countess
we
can
not
all
have
what
we
want
in
this
world
can
we
son
henry
and
he
chuckled
again
most
maliciously
not
sire
till
my
lady
has
thrice
refused
me
the
smith
reminded
the
king
then
she
must
be
quick
about
it
for
we
all
and
my
lord
bishop
here
are
waiting
send
for
her
stephen
by
heaven
i
have
a
curiosity
to
see
her
and
by
heaven
so
have
i
added
prince
rudolf
with
a
merry
smile
and
poor
henry
here
may
be
cured
by
the
sight
the
princess
osra
leant
a
little
further
forward
and
said
gently
tell
us
her
name
and
we
will
send
for
her
indeed
i
also
would
like
to
see
her
but
if
she
refuses
i
shall
be
worse
off
than
i
am
now
and
if
she
says
yes
still
i
must
marry
the
countess
objected
the
smith
nay
said
the
king
if
she
does
not
refuse
you
three
times
you
shall
not
marry
the
countess
but
shall
be
free
to
try
your
fortune
with
the
girl
for
the
smith
had
put
the
old
lion
in
a
better
temper
and
he
thought
he
was
to
witness
more
sport
since
your
majesty
is
so
good
i
must
tell
her
name
said
stephen
though
i
had
rather
have
declared
my
love
to
herself
alone
it
is
the
pleasantest
way
said
prince
rudolf
but
the
thing
can
be
done
in
the
presence
of
others
also
you
must
tell
us
her
name
that
we
may
send
for
her
said
the
princess
her
eyes
wandering
now
from
the
countess
to
the
smith
and
back
to
the
countess
again
well
then
said
stephen
sturdily
the
lady
who
came
riding
down
the
street
and
took
away
my
heart
with
her
is
called
osra
and
her
father
is
named
henry
a
moment
or
two
passed
before
they
understood
what
the
smith
had
said
then
the
old
king
fell
into
a
fit
of
laughter
half
choked
by
coughing
prince
rudolf
clapped
his
hands
in
merry
mockery
and
a
deep
flush
spread
over
the
face
of
the
princess
while
the
countess
her
companion
and
the
younger
prince
seemed
too
astonished
to
do
anything
but
stare
as
for
stephen
having
said
what
he
had
to
say
he
held
his
peace
a
thing
in
him
which
many
men
and
women
also
would
do
well
to
imitate
and
if
they
can
not
let
them
pray
for
the
grace
that
is
needful
heaven
is
omnipotent
the
old
king
having
recovered
from
his
fit
of
laughing
looked
round
on
the
smith
with
infinite
amusement
and
turning
to
his
daughter
he
said
come
osra
you
have
heard
the
declaration
it
remains
only
for
you
to
satisfy
our
good
friend
conscience
by
refusing
him
three
times
for
then
he
will
be
free
to
do
our
pleasure
and
make
the
countess
hilda
happy
the
heart
of
women
is
as
it
would
seem
a
strange
thing
for
the
princess
osra
hearing
what
the
smith
had
said
and
learning
that
he
had
fallen
passionately
in
love
with
her
on
the
mere
sight
of
her
beauty
suddenly
felt
a
tenderness
for
him
and
a
greater
admiration
than
she
had
entertained
before
and
although
she
harboured
no
absurd
idea
of
listening
to
his
madness
or
of
doing
anything
in
the
world
but
laugh
at
it
as
it
deserved
yet
there
came
on
her
a
strange
dislike
of
the
project
that
she
had
herself
in
sport
suggested
namely
that
the
smith
should
be
married
immediately
to
the
countess
hilda
by
the
lord
bishop
of
modenstein
the
fellow
this
smith
had
an
eye
for
true
beauty
it
seemed
it
would
be
hard
to
tie
him
down
to
this
dusky
girl
for
so
the
princess
described
the
lady
whom
her
brother
loved
she
herself
being
like
most
of
the
elphbergs
rather
red
than
black
in
color
accordingly
when
the
king
spoke
to
her
she
said
fretfully
am
i
to
be
put
to
refuse
the
hand
of
such
a
fellow
as
this
why
to
refuse
him
is
a
stain
on
my
dignity
and
she
looked
most
haughty
yet
you
must
grant
him
so
much
because
of
his
oath
said
the
king
well
then
i
refuse
him
said
she
tartly
and
she
turned
her
eyes
away
from
him
that
is
once
said
stephen
the
smith
calmly
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
princess
face
she
felt
his
gaze
her
eyes
were
drawn
back
to
his
and
she
exclaimed
angrily
yes
i
refuse
him
and
again
she
looked
away
but
he
looked
still
more
intently
at
her
waiting
for
the
third
refusal
it
is
as
easy
to
say
no
three
times
as
twice
said
the
king
for
a
man
sire
murmured
prince
rudolf
for
he
was
very
learned
in
the
perilous
knowledge
of
a
woman
whims
and
maybe
read
something
of
what
was
passing
in
his
sister
heart
certainly
he
looked
at
her
and
laughed
and
said
to
the
king
sire
i
think
this
smith
is
a
clever
man
for
what
he
really
desires
is
to
wed
the
countess
and
to
do
it
without
disobliging
my
brother
therefore
he
professes
this
ridiculous
passion
knowing
well
that
osra
will
refuse
him
and
that
he
will
enjoy
the
great
good
fortune
of
marrying
the
countess
against
his
will
thus
he
will
obey
you
and
be
free
from
my
brother
anger
in
truth
you
a
crafty
fellow
master
stephen
there
is
no
craft
sir
said
stephen
i
have
told
nothing
but
the
truth
but
the
king
swore
a
loud
oath
crying
aye
that
there
is
rudolf
has
hit
the
mark
yet
i
do
not
grudge
him
his
good
luck
refuse
him
osra
and
make
him
happy
but
the
dark
flush
came
anew
on
the
princess
face
for
now
she
did
not
know
whether
the
smith
really
loved
her
or
whether
he
had
been
making
a
jest
of
her
in
order
to
save
himself
in
the
eyes
of
her
brother
henry
and
it
became
very
intolerable
to
her
to
suppose
that
the
smith
desired
the
countess
and
had
lied
in
what
he
said
about
herself
making
a
tool
of
her
again
it
was
hardly
more
tolerable
to
give
him
to
the
countess
in
case
he
truly
loved
herself
so
that
her
mind
was
very
greatly
disturbed
and
she
was
devoured
with
eagerness
to
know
the
reality
of
the
smith
feelings
towards
her
for
although
he
was
only
a
smith
yet
he
was
a
wonderfully
handsome
man
in
truth
it
was
curious
that
she
had
not
paid
attention
to
his
looks
before
thus
she
was
reluctant
to
refuse
him
a
third
time
when
the
bishop
of
modenstein
stood
there
waiting
only
for
her
word
to
marry
him
to
the
countess
and
she
rose
suddenly
from
her
seat
and
walked
towards
the
door
of
the
room
and
when
she
had
almost
reached
the
door
she
turned
her
head
over
her
shoulder
and
cast
one
smile
at
stephen
the
smith
as
she
glanced
the
blush
again
mounted
to
her
face
making
her
so
lovely
that
her
father
wondered
and
she
said
in
arch
softness
i
refuse
him
the
third
time
some
other
day
two
denials
are
enough
for
one
day
and
with
that
she
passed
through
the
door
and
vanished
from
their
sight
the
king
and
rudolf
who
had
seen
the
glance
that
she
cast
at
stephen
fell
to
laughing
again
swearing
to
one
another
that
a
woman
was
a
woman
all
the
world
over
whereat
the
lips
of
the
bishop
twitched
but
the
marriage
ca
go
on
cried
rudolf
at
last
let
it
rest
for
said
the
king
whose
anger
was
past
let
it
rest
the
countess
shall
be
guarded
and
since
this
young
fool
and
he
pointed
to
his
son
henry
will
not
wander
while
she
is
caged
let
him
go
where
he
will
then
as
soon
as
osra
has
refused
the
smith
a
third
time
we
will
send
for
the
bishop
and
what
am
i
to
do
sire
asked
stephen
the
smith
why
my
that
would
be
chuckled
the
king
you
may
go
back
to
where
you
came
from
till
i
send
for
you
again
so
stephen
having
thanked
the
king
went
back
home
and
sitting
down
to
the
chasing
of
a
cup
became
very
thoughtful
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
countess
had
been
hardly
treated
and
that
the
prince
deserved
happiness
and
that
the
princess
was
yet
more
lovely
than
his
eyes
had
found
her
before
thus
in
his
work
and
his
meditations
the
afternoon
wore
away
fast
so
goes
time
when
hand
and
head
are
busy
the
princess
osra
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
the
length
of
her
dinner
was
done
and
it
was
eight
and
the
season
being
late
october
it
had
grown
dark
she
had
come
thither
to
be
alone
yet
now
that
she
was
alone
she
could
not
rest
he
was
an
absurd
fellow
that
smith
yes
she
thought
him
fully
as
handsome
as
her
brother
rudolf
but
what
did
henry
find
to
love
in
the
hilda
she
could
not
understand
a
man
caring
for
such
a
colour
a
blackamoor
would
serve
as
well
ah
what
had
that
silly
smith
meant
it
must
have
been
a
trick
as
rudolf
said
yet
when
he
spoke
first
of
her
riding
down
the
street
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
a
man
can
hardly
put
there
of
his
own
will
did
the
silly
fellow
then
really
nay
that
was
absurd
she
prayed
that
it
might
not
be
true
for
she
would
not
have
the
poor
fool
unhappy
nay
he
was
no
fool
it
was
a
trick
then
how
dared
the
insolent
knave
use
her
for
his
tricks
was
there
no
other
maiden
in
strelsau
whose
name
would
have
served
must
he
lay
his
tongue
to
the
name
of
a
daughter
of
the
elphbergs
the
fellow
deserved
flogging
if
it
were
a
trick
ah
was
it
a
trick
or
was
it
the
truth
oh
in
heaven
name
which
was
it
and
the
princess
tore
the
delicate
silk
of
her
ivory
fan
to
shreds
and
flung
the
naked
sticks
with
a
clatter
on
the
floor
i
ca
rest
till
i
know
she
cried
as
she
came
to
a
stand
before
a
long
mirror
let
into
the
panel
of
the
wall
and
saw
herself
at
full
length
in
it
as
she
looked
a
smile
came
parting
her
lips
and
she
threw
her
head
back
as
she
said
i
will
go
and
ask
the
smith
what
he
meant
and
she
smiled
again
at
her
own
face
in
triumphant
daring
for
when
she
looked
she
thought
i
know
what
he
meant
yet
i
will
hear
from
himself
what
he
meant
stephen
the
smith
sat
alone
in
his
house
his
apprentices
were
gone
and
he
himself
neither
worked
nor
supped
but
sat
still
and
idle
by
his
hearth
the
street
was
silent
also
for
it
rained
and
nobody
was
about
then
suddenly
came
a
light
timid
rap
at
the
door
so
light
was
it
that
the
smith
doubted
if
he
had
really
heard
but
it
came
again
and
he
rose
leisurely
and
opened
the
door
even
as
he
did
so
a
slight
tall
figure
slipped
by
him
an
arm
pulled
him
back
the
door
was
pushed
close
again
and
he
was
alone
inside
the
house
with
a
lady
wrapped
in
a
long
and
so
veiled
that
nothing
of
her
face
could
be
seen
welcome
madame
said
stephen
the
smith
and
he
drew
a
chair
forward
and
bowed
to
his
visitor
he
was
not
wearing
his
apron
now
but
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
brown
cloth
and
had
put
on
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
he
might
have
been
expecting
visitors
so
carefully
had
he
arrayed
himself
do
you
know
who
i
am
asked
the
veiled
lady
since
i
was
a
baby
madame
answered
the
smith
i
have
known
the
sun
when
i
saw
it
even
though
clouds
dimmed
its
face
a
corner
of
the
veil
was
drawn
down
and
one
eye
gleamed
in
frightened
mirth
nobody
knows
i
have
come
said
osra
and
you
do
not
know
why
i
have
come
is
it
to
answer
me
for
the
third
time
asked
he
drawing
a
step
nearer
yet
observing
great
deference
in
his
manner
it
is
not
to
answer
at
all
but
to
ask
but
i
am
very
silly
to
have
come
what
is
it
to
me
what
you
meant
i
can
not
conceive
that
it
could
be
anything
madame
said
stephen
smiling
yet
some
think
her
beautiful
my
brother
henry
for
example
we
must
respect
the
opinions
of
princes
observed
the
smith
must
we
share
them
she
asked
drawing
the
veil
yet
a
little
aside
we
can
share
nothing
we
humble
folk
with
princes
or
princesses
madame
yet
we
can
make
free
with
their
names
though
humbler
ones
would
serve
as
well
no
other
would
have
served
at
all
madame
then
you
meant
it
she
cried
in
sudden
eagerness
nay
but
what
madame
i
do
care
whether
you
meant
it
or
not
alas
i
know
it
so
well
that
i
marvel
you
have
come
to
tell
me
the
princess
rose
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
as
she
had
in
her
own
chamber
stephen
stood
regarding
her
as
though
god
had
made
his
eyes
for
that
one
purpose
the
thing
is
nothing
she
declared
petulantly
but
i
have
a
fancy
to
ask
it
stephen
was
it
a
trick
or
or
was
it
really
so
come
answer
me
i
ca
spend
much
time
on
it
it
is
not
worth
a
thought
to
you
if
you
say
no
a
third
time
all
will
be
well
you
will
marry
the
countess
can
i
disobey
the
king
madame
i
am
very
sorry
for
her
said
the
princess
a
lady
of
her
rank
should
not
be
forced
to
marry
a
silversmith
indeed
i
thought
so
all
along
therefore
you
played
the
trick
she
cried
in
unmistakable
anger
stephen
made
no
answer
for
a
time
then
he
said
softly
if
she
loves
the
prince
and
he
her
why
should
they
not
marry
because
his
birth
is
above
hers
i
am
glad
then
that
i
am
of
no
birth
for
i
can
marry
whom
i
will
are
you
so
happy
and
so
free
stephen
sighed
the
princess
and
there
was
no
more
of
the
veil
left
than
served
to
frame
the
picture
of
her
face
so
soon
as
you
have
refused
me
the
third
time
madame
bowed
the
smith
will
you
not
answer
me
cried
the
princess
and
she
smiled
no
more
but
was
as
eager
as
though
she
were
asking
some
important
question
bring
the
countess
here
at
this
time
said
stephen
and
i
will
answer
you
wish
perhaps
to
make
a
comparison
between
us
she
asked
haughtily
i
can
not
be
compelled
to
answer
except
on
my
own
terms
said
the
smith
yet
if
you
will
refuse
me
once
again
the
thing
will
be
finished
i
will
refuse
you
she
cried
when
i
please
but
you
will
bring
the
countess
madame
i
am
very
sorry
for
her
i
have
behaved
ill
to
her
stephen
though
i
meant
only
to
jest
there
is
room
for
amends
madame
said
he
the
princess
looked
long
and
curiously
in
his
face
but
he
met
her
glance
with
a
quiet
smile
it
grows
late
said
he
and
you
should
not
be
here
longer
madame
shall
i
escort
you
to
the
palace
and
have
every
one
asking
with
whom
stephen
the
smith
walks
no
i
will
go
as
i
came
you
have
not
answered
me
stephen
and
you
have
not
refused
me
madame
will
you
answer
me
when
i
come
with
the
countess
yes
i
will
answer
then
the
princess
had
drawn
near
to
the
door
now
stephen
opened
it
for
her
to
pass
out
and
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
she
said
and
i
will
refuse
you
then
perhaps
with
which
she
darted
swiftly
down
the
dark
silent
shining
street
and
was
gone
and
stephen
having
closed
the
door
passed
his
hand
twice
over
his
brow
sighed
thrice
smiled
once
and
set
about
the
preparation
of
his
supper
on
the
next
night
as
the
cathedral
clock
struck
nine
there
arose
a
sudden
tumult
and
excitement
in
the
palace
king
henry
the
lion
was
in
such
a
rage
as
no
man
had
ever
seen
him
in
before
even
rudolf
his
son
did
not
dare
to
laugh
at
him
courtiers
guards
attendants
lackeys
ran
wildly
to
and
fro
in
immense
fear
and
trepidation
a
little
later
and
a
large
company
of
the
king
guard
filed
out
and
under
the
command
of
various
officers
scattered
themselves
through
the
whole
of
strelsau
while
five
mounted
men
rode
at
a
gallop
to
each
of
the
five
gates
of
the
city
bearing
commands
that
the
gates
should
be
closed
and
no
man
woman
or
child
be
allowed
to
pass
out
without
an
order
under
the
hand
of
the
king
marshal
and
the
king
swore
by
heaven
and
by
much
else
that
he
would
lay
them
that
is
to
say
the
persons
whose
disappearance
caused
all
this
hubbub
by
the
heels
and
that
they
should
know
that
there
was
life
in
the
lion
yet
whereat
prince
rudolf
looked
as
serious
as
he
could
contrive
to
look
for
he
was
wonderfully
amused
and
called
for
more
wine
and
the
reason
of
the
whole
thing
was
no
other
than
this
that
the
room
of
the
princess
osra
was
empty
and
the
room
of
the
countess
hilda
was
empty
and
nobody
had
set
eyes
on
henry
the
king
son
for
the
last
two
hours
or
more
now
these
facts
were
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
enough
to
upset
a
man
of
a
temper
far
more
equable
than
was
old
king
henry
the
lion
through
all
the
city
went
the
guards
knocking
at
every
door
disturbing
some
at
their
suppers
some
from
their
beds
some
in
the
midst
of
revelry
some
who
toiled
late
for
a
scanty
livelihood
when
the
doors
were
not
opened
briskly
the
guard
without
ceremony
broke
them
in
they
ransacked
every
crevice
and
cranny
of
every
house
and
displayed
the
utmost
zeal
imaginable
nay
one
old
lady
they
so
terrified
that
she
had
a
fit
there
where
she
lay
in
bed
and
did
not
recover
for
the
best
part
of
a
month
and
thus
having
traversed
all
the
city
and
set
the
whole
place
in
stir
and
commotion
they
came
at
last
to
the
street
where
stephen
lived
and
to
the
sign
of
the
silver
ship
where
he
carried
on
the
business
bequeathed
to
him
by
aaron
lazarus
the
jew
rat
tat
tat
came
thundering
on
the
door
from
the
of
the
sergeant
in
command
of
the
party
there
was
no
answer
no
light
shone
from
the
house
for
the
window
was
closely
shuttered
again
the
sergeant
hammered
on
the
door
this
pestilent
smith
is
gone
to
bed
he
cried
in
vexation
but
we
must
leave
no
house
unsearched
come
we
must
break
in
the
door
and
he
began
to
examine
the
door
and
found
that
it
was
a
fine
solid
door
of
good
oak
and
clamped
with
iron
phew
we
shall
have
a
job
with
this
door
he
sighed
why
in
the
devil
name
does
the
fellow
answer
stephen
stephen
ho
there
stephen
yet
no
answer
came
from
the
inside
of
the
house
but
at
this
moment
another
sound
struck
sharp
on
the
ears
of
the
sergeant
and
his
men
it
was
the
noise
of
flames
crackling
from
the
house
next
to
stephen
which
belonged
to
him
but
was
inhabited
by
a
there
welled
out
smoke
in
volumes
from
every
window
and
the
and
his
family
appeared
at
the
windows
calling
for
aid
seeing
this
the
sergeant
blew
very
loudly
the
whistle
that
he
carried
and
cried
fire
and
bade
his
men
run
and
procure
a
ladder
for
plainly
the
house
was
on
fire
and
it
was
a
more
urgent
matter
to
rescue
men
and
women
from
burning
than
to
find
the
countess
and
the
prince
presently
the
ladder
came
and
a
great
crowd
of
people
roused
by
the
whistle
and
the
cries
of
fire
came
also
and
then
the
door
of
stephen
house
was
opened
and
stephen
himself
looking
out
asked
what
was
the
matter
being
told
that
the
next
house
was
on
fire
he
turned
very
grave
for
the
house
was
his
and
waited
for
a
moment
to
watch
the
and
his
family
being
brought
down
the
ladder
which
task
was
safely
and
prosperously
accomplished
but
the
sergeant
said
to
him
the
fire
may
well
spread
and
if
there
is
anyone
in
your
house
it
would
be
prudent
to
get
them
out
that
is
well
thought
of
said
stephen
approvingly
i
was
working
late
with
three
apprentices
and
they
are
still
in
the
house
and
he
put
his
head
in
at
his
door
and
called
you
had
better
come
out
lads
the
fire
may
spread
but
the
sergeant
turned
away
again
and
busied
himself
in
putting
the
fire
out
then
three
lads
one
being
very
tall
came
out
of
stephen
house
clad
in
their
leather
breeches
their
aprons
and
the
caps
that
apprentices
wore
and
for
a
moment
they
stood
watching
the
fire
at
the
then
seeing
that
the
fire
was
burning
low
which
it
did
very
quickly
they
did
not
stay
till
the
attention
of
the
sergeant
was
released
from
it
but
accompanied
by
stephen
turned
down
the
street
and
going
along
at
a
brisk
rate
rounded
the
corner
and
came
into
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
cathedral
the
gates
will
be
shut
i
fear
said
the
tallest
apprentice
how
came
the
fire
stephen
it
was
three
or
four
trusses
of
hay
sir
and
a
few
crowns
to
repair
his
scorched
paint
shall
we
go
to
the
gate
yes
we
must
try
the
gate
said
prince
henry
gathering
the
hand
of
the
countess
into
his
and
the
third
apprentice
walked
silently
by
stephen
side
yet
once
as
she
went
she
said
softly
so
it
was
no
trick
stephen
no
trick
but
the
truth
madame
said
stephen
i
do
not
know
said
osra
how
i
am
to
return
to
the
palace
in
these
clothes
let
us
get
your
brother
and
the
countess
away
first
counselled
the
smith
now
when
they
came
to
the
nearest
gate
it
was
shut
but
at
the
moment
a
troop
of
mounted
men
rode
up
having
been
sent
by
the
king
to
scour
the
country
round
in
case
the
fugitives
should
have
escaped
already
from
the
city
and
the
commandant
of
the
company
bore
an
order
from
the
king
marshal
for
the
opening
of
the
gate
seeing
this
stephen
the
smith
went
up
to
him
and
began
to
talk
to
him
the
three
apprentices
standing
close
by
the
commandant
knew
stephen
well
and
was
pleased
to
talk
with
him
while
the
gates
were
opened
and
the
troopers
filed
through
stephen
kept
close
by
him
till
the
troopers
were
all
through
then
he
turned
and
spoke
to
the
apprentices
and
they
nodded
assent
the
commandant
checked
his
horse
for
an
instant
when
he
was
through
the
gate
and
bent
down
and
took
stephen
hand
to
shake
it
in
farewell
stephen
took
his
hand
with
marvellous
friendliness
and
held
it
and
would
not
let
him
go
but
the
apprentices
edged
cautiously
nearer
and
nearer
the
gate
enough
man
enough
laughed
the
commandant
we
are
not
parting
for
ever
i
trust
not
sir
i
trust
not
said
stephen
earnestly
still
holding
his
hand
come
let
me
go
see
the
wants
to
shut
the
gate
true
said
stephen
then
sir
hallo
hallo
stop
stop
oh
the
young
rascals
for
even
as
stephen
spoke
two
of
the
apprentices
had
darted
through
the
gate
and
run
swiftly
forward
into
the
gloom
of
the
night
stephen
swore
an
oath
the
rogues
he
cried
they
were
to
have
worked
all
night
to
finish
an
image
of
our
lady
and
now
i
shall
see
no
more
of
them
till
they
shall
pay
for
their
prank
then
by
heaven
they
shall
but
the
commandant
laughed
i
am
sorry
i
ca
catch
them
for
you
friend
stephen
said
he
but
i
have
other
fish
to
fry
well
boys
will
be
boys
do
be
too
hard
on
them
when
they
return
they
must
answer
for
what
they
do
said
stephen
and
the
commandant
rode
on
and
the
gates
were
shut
then
the
princess
osra
said
will
they
escape
stephen
they
have
money
in
their
purses
love
in
their
hearts
and
an
angry
king
behind
them
i
should
travel
quickly
madame
if
i
were
so
placed
the
princess
looked
through
the
grating
of
the
gate
yes
she
said
they
have
all
those
how
happy
they
must
be
stephen
but
what
am
i
to
do
stephen
made
no
answer
and
they
walked
back
in
silence
to
his
house
it
may
be
that
they
were
wondering
whether
prince
henry
and
the
countess
would
escape
yet
it
may
be
that
they
thought
of
something
else
when
they
reached
the
house
stephen
bade
the
princess
go
into
the
inner
room
and
resume
her
own
dress
that
she
might
return
to
the
palace
and
that
it
might
not
be
known
where
she
had
been
nor
how
she
had
aided
her
brother
to
evade
the
king
prohibition
and
when
she
still
strangely
silent
went
in
as
he
bade
her
he
took
his
great
staff
in
his
hand
and
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
his
head
nearly
touching
the
lintel
and
his
shoulders
filling
almost
all
the
space
between
and
illustration
stephen
stood
on
the
threshold
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
when
he
had
stood
there
a
little
while
the
same
sergeant
of
the
guard
recollecting
now
that
the
fire
at
the
was
out
that
he
had
never
searched
the
house
of
the
smith
came
again
with
his
four
men
and
told
stephen
to
stand
aside
and
allow
him
to
enter
the
house
for
i
must
search
it
he
said
or
my
orders
will
not
be
performed
those
whom
you
seek
are
not
here
said
stephen
that
i
must
see
for
myself
answered
the
sergeant
come
smith
stand
aside
when
the
princess
heard
the
voices
outside
she
put
her
head
round
the
door
of
the
inner
room
and
cried
in
great
alarm
to
stephen
they
must
not
come
in
stephen
at
any
cost
they
must
not
come
in
do
not
be
afraid
madame
they
shall
not
come
in
said
he
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
house
exclaimed
the
sergeant
it
is
nothing
uncommon
to
hear
in
a
house
said
stephen
and
he
grasped
more
firmly
his
great
staff
will
you
make
way
for
us
demanded
the
sergeant
for
the
last
time
will
you
make
way
stephen
eyes
kindled
for
though
he
was
a
man
of
peace
yet
his
strength
was
great
and
he
loved
sometimes
to
use
it
and
above
all
he
loved
to
use
it
now
at
the
bidding
and
in
protection
of
his
dear
princess
so
he
answered
the
sergeant
from
between
set
teeth
over
my
dead
body
you
can
come
in
then
the
sergeant
drew
his
sword
and
his
men
set
their
halberds
in
rest
and
the
sergeant
crying
in
the
king
name
came
at
stephen
with
drawn
sword
and
struck
fiercely
at
him
but
stephen
let
the
great
staff
drop
on
the
sergeant
shoulder
and
the
sergeant
arm
fell
powerless
by
his
side
thereupon
the
guards
cried
aloud
and
people
began
to
come
out
of
their
houses
seeing
that
there
was
a
fight
at
stephen
door
and
stephen
eyes
gleamed
and
when
the
guards
thrust
at
him
he
struck
at
them
and
two
of
them
he
stretched
senseless
on
the
ground
for
his
height
and
reach
were
such
that
he
struck
them
before
they
could
come
near
enough
to
touch
him
and
having
no
firearms
they
could
not
bring
him
down
the
princess
now
fully
dressed
in
her
own
garments
came
out
into
the
outer
room
and
stood
there
looking
at
stephen
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
and
her
eyes
grew
dim
as
she
looked
and
growing
very
eager
and
being
very
much
moved
she
kept
murmuring
to
herself
i
have
not
said
no
thrice
and
she
spent
no
thought
on
the
countess
or
her
brother
nor
on
how
she
was
to
return
undetected
to
the
palace
but
saw
only
the
figure
of
stephen
on
the
threshold
and
heard
only
the
cries
of
the
guards
who
assaulted
him
it
seemed
to
her
a
brave
thing
to
have
such
a
man
to
fight
for
her
and
to
offer
his
life
to
save
her
shame
old
king
henry
was
not
a
patient
man
and
when
he
had
waited
two
hours
without
news
of
son
daughter
or
countess
he
flew
into
a
mighty
passion
and
sent
one
for
his
horse
and
another
for
rudolf
horse
and
a
third
for
rudolf
himself
and
he
drank
a
draught
of
wine
and
called
to
rudolf
to
accompany
him
that
they
might
see
for
themselves
what
the
lazy
hounds
of
guards
were
doing
that
they
had
not
yet
come
up
with
the
quarry
prince
rudolf
laughed
and
yawned
and
wished
his
brother
at
the
devil
but
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
with
the
king
thus
they
traversed
the
city
riding
swiftly
the
old
king
furiously
upbraiding
every
officer
and
soldier
whom
he
met
then
they
rode
to
the
gate
and
all
the
said
that
nobody
had
gone
out
save
that
one
admitted
that
two
apprentices
of
stephen
the
silversmith
had
contrived
to
slip
out
when
the
gates
were
open
to
let
the
troopers
pass
but
the
king
made
nothing
of
it
and
turning
with
his
son
rode
up
the
street
where
stephen
lived
here
they
came
suddenly
into
the
midst
of
a
crowd
that
filled
all
the
roadway
and
would
hardly
let
the
horses
move
even
at
a
foot
pace
the
king
cried
out
angrily
what
is
this
tumult
then
the
people
knew
him
and
since
common
folk
are
always
anxious
to
serve
and
commend
themselves
to
the
great
a
score
began
all
at
once
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
some
starting
with
the
fire
some
going
straight
to
the
fight
and
the
king
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
the
babel
of
voices
and
different
stories
and
prince
rudolf
dropped
his
reins
and
sat
on
his
horse
laughing
but
the
king
his
patience
being
clean
gone
drew
his
sword
and
cried
fiercely
make
way
and
set
his
spurs
to
his
horse
not
recking
whether
he
hurt
any
man
in
life
or
limb
thus
he
gained
a
passage
through
the
crowd
and
came
near
to
house
prince
rudolf
following
in
his
wake
still
greatly
amused
at
all
that
was
happening
but
the
sight
they
saw
there
arrested
even
prince
rudolf
smiles
and
he
raised
himself
in
his
stirrups
with
a
sudden
cry
of
wonder
for
four
more
of
the
guard
had
come
and
there
were
now
six
standing
round
the
doorway
and
three
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
but
stephen
the
smith
still
stood
on
the
threshold
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
blood
flowed
from
a
wound
in
his
head
but
he
twirled
the
staff
to
and
fro
and
was
not
weary
and
none
of
the
guard
dared
to
rush
in
and
close
with
him
thus
he
had
held
the
threshold
for
an
hour
yet
the
princess
osra
could
not
escape
unless
he
could
drive
off
the
guard
for
a
few
moments
and
this
he
hoped
to
do
thinking
that
they
might
draw
off
and
wait
for
reinforcements
but
in
any
case
he
had
sworn
that
they
should
not
pass
and
osra
did
not
pray
him
to
let
them
pass
but
stood
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
room
behind
him
her
hands
clasped
her
face
rigid
and
her
eyes
all
aflame
with
admiration
of
his
strength
and
his
courage
thus
matters
were
when
the
old
king
and
prince
rudolf
broke
through
the
crowd
that
ringed
the
house
round
and
the
king
cried
out
asking
what
was
the
meaning
of
all
that
he
saw
but
when
the
king
heard
that
stephen
the
smith
resisted
the
officers
would
not
suffer
his
house
to
be
searched
had
stretched
three
of
the
guards
senseless
on
the
ground
and
still
more
than
held
his
own
he
fell
into
a
great
rage
he
roared
out
on
them
all
calling
them
cowards
and
before
his
son
or
any
one
else
could
stop
him
he
drew
his
sword
and
dug
his
spurs
into
his
horse
the
horse
bounded
forward
and
knocked
down
one
of
the
guards
who
stood
round
stephen
then
the
king
neither
challenging
stephen
to
yield
nor
giving
him
time
to
stand
aside
being
carried
away
by
passion
raised
his
sword
and
rode
full
at
him
and
the
princess
from
within
caught
sight
of
his
face
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
with
a
moan
and
hid
her
face
then
stephen
saw
that
it
was
the
king
and
none
other
who
rode
against
him
and
even
had
the
king
given
him
time
it
may
be
that
he
would
not
have
yielded
for
he
was
a
very
resolute
man
and
he
had
pledged
his
promise
to
osra
the
princess
but
he
had
no
time
for
thought
for
the
king
was
on
him
in
the
space
of
a
second
and
he
could
do
nothing
but
drop
the
staff
that
he
held
and
stand
defenceless
in
the
doorway
for
he
would
neither
strike
the
king
nor
yield
the
passage
but
the
king
in
his
fury
not
heeding
that
stephen
had
dropped
his
staff
drew
back
his
arm
and
lunged
with
his
sword
and
thrust
the
smith
through
the
chest
and
stephen
reeled
and
fell
on
one
knee
and
his
blood
flowed
out
on
the
stone
of
the
doorstep
then
the
king
reined
in
his
horse
and
sat
looking
down
on
stephen
but
rudolf
leapt
to
the
ground
and
came
and
caught
hold
of
stephen
supporting
him
and
asking
what
does
it
mean
man
what
does
it
mean
then
stephen
being
very
faint
with
his
wound
said
with
difficulty
come
in
alone
you
and
the
king
alone
prince
rudolf
looked
at
the
king
who
sheathed
his
sword
and
dismounted
from
his
horse
the
prince
supported
stephen
inside
the
house
and
the
king
followed
them
shutting
the
door
on
all
the
people
outside
then
king
henry
saw
his
daughter
crouching
now
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
surprise
and
wonder
banished
his
rage
and
he
could
not
do
more
than
gasp
her
name
while
the
prince
who
knelt
supporting
stephen
cried
to
her
asking
how
she
came
there
but
she
answered
nothing
she
took
her
hands
from
her
face
and
looked
at
stephen
and
when
she
saw
that
he
was
hurt
and
bleeding
she
fell
to
sobbing
and
hid
her
face
again
and
she
did
not
know
whether
she
would
have
him
live
or
die
for
if
he
lived
he
could
not
be
hers
and
if
he
died
her
heart
would
ache
sorely
for
him
then
stephen
being
supported
by
the
arms
of
prince
rudolf
made
shift
to
speak
and
he
told
the
king
how
at
his
persuasion
the
princess
had
brought
the
countess
thither
how
he
himself
had
contrived
the
presence
of
the
prince
at
the
same
time
how
again
the
princess
had
been
prevailed
upon
to
aid
the
lovers
how
they
assumed
the
disguise
of
apprentices
and
how
hearing
the
arrival
of
the
guard
they
had
escaped
out
into
the
street
and
lastly
how
that
the
prince
and
the
countess
had
got
out
of
the
city
but
he
said
nothing
of
the
fire
at
the
nor
of
how
he
himself
had
bribed
the
to
set
the
hay
on
fire
speaking
to
him
from
the
back
windows
of
the
house
and
flinging
a
purse
of
gold
pieces
across
to
him
nor
did
this
ever
become
known
to
the
king
and
when
stephen
had
said
his
say
he
fell
back
very
faint
in
the
arms
of
the
prince
and
the
prince
tore
a
scarf
from
his
waist
and
tried
to
staunch
the
blood
from
stephen
wound
but
the
old
king
who
was
a
hard
man
smiled
grimly
indeed
he
has
tricked
us
finely
this
smith
and
he
is
a
clever
fellow
said
he
but
unless
he
would
rather
hang
than
bleed
to
death
let
his
wound
be
rudolf
for
by
heaven
if
you
cure
him
i
will
hang
him
do
not
be
afraid
sire
said
stephen
the
prince
can
not
cure
me
you
still
strike
straight
though
you
are
hard
on
seventy
straight
enough
for
a
rascal
like
you
said
the
king
well
pleased
and
he
added
hold
the
fellow
easily
rudolf
i
would
not
have
him
suffer
and
this
was
they
say
the
only
time
in
all
his
life
that
henry
the
lion
shewed
a
sign
of
pity
to
any
man
but
stephen
was
now
very
faint
and
he
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
princess
and
rudolf
followed
his
eyes
now
rudolf
had
an
affection
for
stephen
and
he
loved
his
sister
and
was
a
man
of
soft
heart
so
he
cried
gently
to
osra
come
sister
and
help
me
with
him
and
she
rose
and
came
and
sat
down
by
the
wall
and
gathered
stephen
head
into
her
lap
and
there
he
lay
looking
up
at
her
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
but
still
he
bled
and
his
blood
stained
the
white
cloak
that
she
wore
over
her
robe
and
her
tears
dropped
on
his
face
but
rudolf
took
his
father
by
the
arm
and
led
him
a
little
way
off
saying
what
matter
sire
the
girl
is
young
and
the
man
is
dying
let
them
be
the
old
king
grumbling
let
himself
be
led
away
and
perhaps
even
he
was
moved
for
he
forgot
prince
henry
and
the
countess
and
did
not
think
of
sending
men
in
pursuit
of
them
for
which
reason
they
obtained
a
fair
and
long
start
in
their
flight
then
stephen
looking
up
at
osra
said
do
not
weep
madame
they
will
escape
now
and
they
will
be
happy
i
was
not
weeping
for
them
said
the
princess
stephen
was
silent
for
a
little
and
then
he
said
in
very
truth
it
was
no
trick
madame
it
was
even
as
i
said
from
the
first
day
that
you
rode
along
the
street
here
it
was
always
the
same
in
my
heart
and
would
always
have
been
however
long
i
had
lived
i
do
not
doubt
it
stephen
and
it
is
not
for
doubt
of
it
that
i
weep
said
she
then
after
a
little
while
he
said
do
you
weep
madame
because
i
am
dying
yes
i
weep
for
that
would
you
have
me
live
madame
he
asked
no
i
would
not
no
but
i
do
not
know
she
said
then
stephen
the
smith
smiled
and
his
smile
was
happy
yet
said
he
it
would
make
small
difference
to
the
princess
osra
whether
stephen
the
smith
lived
or
died
at
this
although
he
lay
there
a
dying
man
a
sudden
flush
of
red
spread
all
over
her
cheeks
and
she
turned
her
eyes
away
from
his
and
would
not
meet
his
glance
she
made
him
no
answer
and
he
said
again
what
can
it
concern
the
princess
whether
i
live
or
die
still
the
blush
burnt
on
her
cheek
and
still
she
had
no
answer
to
give
to
stephen
as
he
lay
dying
with
his
head
on
her
lap
and
a
bright
gleam
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
tried
to
move
a
hand
towards
her
hand
and
she
seeing
the
effort
put
out
her
hand
and
held
his
and
he
whispered
very
low
for
he
could
hardly
speak
you
have
not
yet
refused
me
three
times
madame
at
that
her
eyes
came
back
to
his
and
their
eyes
dwelt
long
on
one
another
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
them
that
all
things
became
possible
life
and
joy
and
love
yet
since
all
could
not
be
they
were
content
that
none
should
be
then
the
princess
bent
low
over
his
head
and
she
whispered
to
him
no
i
have
not
refused
you
thrice
stephen
his
lips
just
moved
once
again
and
being
very
near
him
she
heard
and
you
will
not
he
said
no
said
she
and
she
kissed
his
lips
and
he
smiled
and
turned
on
his
side
and
he
nestled
his
head
as
it
were
cosily
on
her
lap
and
he
said
no
more
thus
died
stephen
the
silversmith
of
strelsau
happy
in
his
death
because
osra
the
princess
had
not
refused
him
thrice
and
she
laid
him
gently
on
the
ground
and
rose
and
went
across
to
where
the
king
sat
with
rudolf
sire
he
is
dead
said
she
it
is
well
said
the
king
and
he
bade
rudolf
go
and
cause
all
the
people
to
leave
the
streets
and
return
to
their
houses
and
when
all
the
streets
were
cleared
the
princess
veiled
herself
and
her
brother
mounted
her
on
his
horse
and
thus
she
rode
back
to
the
palace
and
none
knew
that
she
had
been
in
the
house
of
stephen
the
silversmith
and
after
many
months
prince
henry
who
had
made
good
his
escape
and
married
the
lady
whom
he
loved
was
reconciled
to
his
father
and
returned
to
the
city
of
strelsau
and
when
he
heard
how
stephen
had
died
he
raised
a
stately
monument
over
him
and
had
carved
on
it
his
name
and
the
day
and
year
in
which
he
had
died
and
underneath
he
caused
to
be
engraved
the
words
from
a
friend
to
a
friend
but
when
this
monument
had
stood
three
days
in
its
place
there
came
thither
a
lady
closely
veiled
she
prayed
on
her
knees
by
the
monument
for
a
long
while
and
then
rose
and
stood
regarding
it
and
her
eyes
rested
on
the
last
words
that
prince
henry
had
written
on
the
stone
then
she
came
nearer
and
kissed
the
words
and
when
she
had
kissed
them
she
whispered
softly
from
a
lover
to
a
lover
and
having
whispered
this
she
turned
away
and
went
back
to
the
palace
and
came
no
more
to
the
tomb
for
fear
that
the
people
should
remark
her
coming
yet
often
in
the
days
that
followed
she
would
open
the
window
of
her
by
night
and
she
would
whisper
to
the
silent
trusty
darkness
that
holds
secrets
and
comforts
sore
hearts
not
thrice
stephen
not
thrice
therefore
it
may
be
that
there
had
been
a
sweet
madness
in
her
heart
and
that
stephen
the
silversmith
had
done
a
great
thing
a
thing
that
would
appear
impossible
before
he
died
and
as
prince
rudolf
said
what
matter
for
the
girl
was
young
and
the
dream
was
sweet
and
the
man
was
dead
and
in
death
at
last
are
all
men
equal
chapter
ii
the
wager
of
the
marquis
de
m√©rosailles
in
the
year
as
spring
began
there
arrived
at
strelsau
a
french
nobleman
of
high
rank
and
great
possessions
endowed
also
with
many
accomplishments
he
came
to
visit
prince
rudolf
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
while
the
prince
was
at
paris
in
the
course
of
his
travels
king
henry
received
de
m√©rosailles
for
such
was
his
name
most
graciously
and
sent
a
guard
of
honour
to
conduct
him
to
the
castle
of
zenda
where
the
prince
was
then
staying
in
company
with
his
sister
osra
there
the
marquis
on
his
arrival
was
greeted
with
much
joy
by
prince
rudolf
who
found
his
sojourn
in
the
country
somewhat
irksome
and
was
glad
of
the
society
of
a
friend
with
whom
he
could
talk
and
sport
and
play
at
cards
all
these
things
he
did
with
de
m√©rosailles
and
a
great
friendship
arose
between
the
young
men
so
that
they
spoke
very
freely
to
one
another
at
all
times
and
most
of
all
when
they
had
drunk
their
wine
and
sat
together
in
the
evening
in
prince
rudolf
chamber
that
looked
across
the
moat
towards
the
gardens
for
the
new
that
now
stands
on
the
site
of
these
gardens
was
not
then
built
and
one
night
de
m√©rosailles
made
bold
to
ask
the
prince
how
it
fell
out
that
his
sister
the
princess
a
lady
of
such
great
beauty
seemed
sad
and
shewed
no
pleasure
in
the
society
of
any
gentleman
but
treated
all
alike
with
coldness
and
disdain
prince
rudolf
laughing
answered
that
girls
were
strange
creatures
and
that
he
had
ceased
to
trouble
his
head
about
them
of
his
heart
he
said
nothing
and
he
finished
by
exclaiming
on
my
honour
i
doubt
if
she
so
much
as
knows
you
are
here
for
she
has
not
looked
at
you
once
since
your
arrival
and
he
smiled
maliciously
for
he
knew
that
the
marquis
was
not
accustomed
to
be
neglected
by
ladies
and
would
take
it
ill
that
even
a
princess
should
be
unconscious
of
his
presence
in
this
he
calculated
rightly
for
de
m√©rosailles
was
greatly
vexed
and
twisting
his
glass
in
his
fingers
he
said
if
she
were
not
a
princess
and
your
sister
sir
i
would
engage
to
make
her
look
at
me
i
am
not
hurt
by
her
looking
at
you
rejoined
the
prince
for
that
evening
he
was
very
merry
a
look
is
no
great
thing
the
marquis
being
no
less
merry
and
knowing
that
rudolf
had
not
the
regard
for
his
dignity
that
a
prince
should
have
threw
out
carelessly
a
kiss
is
more
sir
it
is
a
great
deal
more
laughed
the
prince
tugging
his
moustache
are
you
ready
for
a
wager
sir
asked
de
m√©rosailles
leaning
across
the
table
towards
him
i
lay
you
a
thousand
crowns
to
a
hundred
that
you
do
not
gain
a
kiss
using
what
means
you
will
save
force
i
take
that
wager
sir
cried
the
marquis
but
it
shall
be
three
not
one
have
a
care
said
the
prince
do
go
too
near
the
flame
my
lord
there
are
some
wings
in
strelsau
singed
at
that
candle
indeed
the
light
is
very
bright
assented
the
marquis
courteously
that
risk
i
must
run
though
if
i
am
to
win
my
wager
it
is
to
be
three
then
and
by
what
means
i
will
save
force
even
so
said
rudolf
and
he
laughed
again
for
he
thought
the
wager
harmless
since
by
no
device
could
de
m√©rosailles
win
so
much
as
one
kiss
from
the
princess
osra
and
the
wager
stood
at
three
but
he
did
not
think
how
he
wronged
his
sister
by
using
her
name
lightly
being
in
all
such
matters
a
man
of
careless
mind
but
the
marquis
having
made
his
wager
set
himself
steadily
to
win
it
therefore
he
brought
forth
the
choicest
clothes
from
his
wardrobe
and
ornaments
and
perfumes
and
he
laid
fine
presents
at
the
feet
and
he
waylaid
her
wherever
she
went
and
was
profuse
of
glances
sighs
and
hints
and
he
wrote
sonnets
as
fine
gentlemen
used
in
those
days
and
lyrics
and
pastorals
wherein
she
figured
under
charming
names
these
he
bribed
the
princess
to
leave
in
their
mistress
chamber
moreover
he
looked
now
sorrowful
now
passionate
and
he
ate
nothing
at
dinner
but
drank
his
wine
in
wild
gulps
as
though
he
sought
to
banish
sadness
so
that
in
a
word
there
was
no
device
in
cupid
armoury
that
the
marquis
de
m√©rosailles
did
not
practise
in
the
endeavour
to
win
a
look
from
the
princess
osra
but
no
look
came
and
he
got
nothing
from
her
but
cold
civility
yet
she
had
looked
at
him
when
he
looked
not
for
princesses
are
much
like
other
maidens
and
thought
him
a
very
pretty
gentleman
and
was
highly
amused
by
his
extravagance
yet
she
did
not
believe
it
to
witness
any
true
devotion
to
her
but
thought
it
mere
gallantry
then
one
day
de
m√©rosailles
having
tried
all
else
that
he
could
think
of
took
to
his
bed
he
sent
for
a
physician
and
paid
him
a
high
fee
to
find
the
seeds
of
a
rapid
and
fatal
disease
in
him
and
he
made
his
whiten
his
face
and
darken
his
room
and
he
groaned
very
pitifully
saying
that
he
was
sick
and
that
he
was
glad
of
it
for
death
would
be
better
far
than
the
continued
disdain
of
the
princess
osra
and
all
this
being
told
by
the
marquis
servants
to
the
princess
reached
osra
ears
and
caused
her
much
perturbation
for
she
now
perceived
that
the
passion
of
the
marquis
was
real
and
deep
and
she
became
very
sorry
for
him
the
longer
the
face
of
the
rascally
physician
grew
the
more
sad
the
princess
became
she
walked
up
and
down
bewailing
the
terrible
effects
of
her
beauty
wishing
that
she
were
not
so
fair
and
mourning
very
tenderly
for
the
sad
plight
of
the
unhappy
marquis
through
all
prince
rudolf
looked
on
but
was
bound
by
his
wager
not
to
undeceive
her
moreover
he
found
much
entertainment
in
the
matter
and
swore
that
it
was
worth
three
times
a
thousand
crowns
at
last
the
marquis
sent
by
the
mouth
of
his
physician
a
very
humble
and
pitiful
message
to
the
princess
in
which
he
spoke
of
himself
as
near
to
death
hinted
at
the
cruel
cause
of
his
condition
and
prayed
her
of
compassion
to
visit
him
in
his
chamber
and
speak
a
word
of
comfort
or
at
least
let
him
look
on
her
face
for
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
he
said
might
cure
even
what
it
had
caused
illustration
the
physician
receives
princess
deceived
by
this
appeal
princess
osra
agreed
to
go
moved
by
some
strange
impulse
she
put
on
her
choicest
array
dressed
her
hair
most
splendidly
and
came
into
the
chamber
looking
like
a
goddess
there
lay
the
marquis
white
as
a
ghost
and
languid
on
his
pillows
and
they
were
left
as
they
thought
alone
then
osra
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
very
gently
and
kindly
to
him
glancing
only
at
the
madness
which
brought
him
to
his
sad
state
and
imploring
him
to
summon
his
resolution
and
conquer
his
sickness
for
his
friends
sake
at
home
in
france
and
for
the
sake
of
her
brother
who
loved
him
there
is
nobody
who
loves
me
said
the
marquis
petulantly
and
when
osra
cried
out
at
this
he
went
on
for
the
love
of
those
whom
i
do
not
love
is
nothing
to
me
and
the
only
soul
alive
i
love
there
he
stopped
but
his
eyes
fixed
on
osra
face
ended
the
sentence
for
him
and
she
blushed
and
looked
away
then
thinking
the
moment
was
come
he
burst
suddenly
into
a
flood
of
protestations
and
cursing
himself
for
a
fool
and
a
presumptuous
madman
pitifully
craving
her
pardon
and
declaring
that
he
did
not
deserve
her
kindness
and
yet
that
he
could
not
live
without
it
and
that
anyhow
he
would
be
dead
soon
and
thus
cease
to
trouble
her
but
she
being
thus
passionately
assailed
showed
such
sweet
tenderness
and
compunction
and
pity
that
de
m√©rosailles
came
very
near
to
forgetting
that
he
was
playing
a
comedy
and
threw
himself
into
his
part
with
eagerness
redoubling
his
vehemence
and
feeling
now
full
half
of
what
he
said
for
the
princess
was
to
his
eyes
far
more
beautiful
in
her
softer
mood
yet
he
remembered
his
wager
and
at
last
when
she
was
nearly
in
tears
and
ready
as
it
seemed
to
do
anything
to
give
him
comfort
he
cried
desperately
ah
leave
leave
me
leave
me
to
die
alone
yet
for
pity
sake
before
you
go
and
before
i
die
give
me
your
forgiveness
and
let
your
lips
touch
my
forehead
in
token
of
it
then
i
shall
die
in
peace
at
that
the
princess
blushed
still
more
and
her
eyes
were
wet
and
shone
for
she
was
deeply
touched
at
his
misery
and
at
the
sad
prospect
of
the
death
for
love
of
so
gallant
a
gentleman
thus
she
could
scarcely
speak
for
emotion
and
the
marquis
seeing
her
emotion
was
himself
deeply
affected
and
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
bent
over
him
and
whispered
comfort
to
him
then
she
leant
down
and
very
lightly
touched
his
forehead
with
her
lips
he
felt
her
eyelashes
which
were
wet
with
tears
brush
the
skin
of
his
forehead
and
then
she
sobbed
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
indeed
his
state
seemed
to
her
most
pitiful
thus
de
m√©rosailles
had
won
one
of
his
three
kisses
yet
strange
to
tell
there
was
no
triumph
in
him
but
now
he
perceived
the
baseness
of
his
device
and
the
sweet
kindness
of
the
princess
working
together
with
the
great
beauty
of
her
softened
manner
so
affected
him
that
he
thought
no
more
of
his
wager
and
could
not
endure
to
carry
on
his
deception
nothing
would
serve
his
turn
but
to
confess
to
the
princess
what
he
had
done
humbling
himself
in
the
dust
before
her
and
entreating
her
to
pardon
him
and
let
him
find
forgiveness
impelled
by
these
feelings
after
he
had
lain
still
a
few
moments
listening
to
the
princess
weeping
he
leapt
suddenly
out
of
bed
showing
himself
fully
dressed
under
the
which
he
now
eagerly
tore
off
and
he
rubbed
all
the
white
he
could
from
his
cheeks
and
then
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
princess
crying
to
her
that
he
had
played
the
meanest
trick
on
her
and
that
he
was
a
scoundrel
and
no
gentleman
and
that
unless
she
forgave
him
he
should
in
very
truth
die
nay
that
he
would
not
consent
to
live
unless
he
could
win
from
her
pardon
for
his
deceit
and
in
all
this
he
was
now
absolutely
in
earnest
wondering
only
how
he
had
not
been
as
passionately
enamoured
of
her
from
the
first
as
he
had
feigned
himself
to
be
for
a
man
in
love
can
never
conceive
himself
out
of
it
nor
he
that
is
out
of
it
in
it
for
if
he
can
he
is
half
way
to
the
one
or
the
other
however
little
he
may
know
it
at
first
the
princess
sat
as
though
she
were
turned
to
stone
but
when
he
finished
his
confession
and
she
understood
the
trick
that
had
been
played
on
her
and
how
not
only
her
kiss
but
also
her
tears
had
been
won
from
her
by
fraud
and
when
she
thought
as
she
did
that
the
marquis
was
playing
another
trick
on
her
and
that
there
was
no
more
truth
or
honesty
in
his
present
protestations
than
in
those
which
went
before
she
fell
into
great
shame
and
into
a
great
rage
her
eyes
flashed
like
the
eyes
of
her
father
himself
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
looked
down
on
de
m√©rosailles
as
he
knelt
imploring
her
now
her
face
turned
pale
from
red
and
she
set
her
lips
and
she
drew
her
gown
close
round
her
lest
his
touch
should
defile
it
so
the
unhappy
gentleman
understood
her
gesture
and
she
picked
her
steps
daintily
round
him
for
fear
she
should
happen
to
come
in
contact
with
so
foul
a
thing
thus
she
walked
to
the
door
and
having
reached
it
she
turned
and
said
to
him
your
death
may
blot
out
the
insult
nothing
less
and
with
her
head
held
high
and
her
whole
air
full
of
scorn
she
swept
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
marquis
on
his
knees
he
started
up
to
follow
her
but
dared
not
he
flung
himself
on
the
bed
in
a
paroxysm
of
shame
and
vexation
and
now
of
love
also
and
he
cried
out
loud
then
my
death
shall
blot
it
out
since
nothing
else
will
serve
he
was
in
a
desperate
mood
for
a
long
time
he
lay
there
and
then
having
risen
dressed
himself
in
a
sombre
suit
of
black
and
buckled
his
sword
by
his
side
and
having
put
on
his
riding
boots
and
summoned
his
servant
bade
him
saddle
his
horse
for
said
he
to
himself
i
will
ride
into
the
forest
and
there
kill
myself
and
perhaps
when
i
am
dead
the
princess
will
forgive
and
will
believe
in
my
love
and
grieve
a
little
for
me
now
as
he
went
from
his
chamber
to
cross
the
moat
by
the
drawbridge
he
encountered
prince
rudolf
returning
from
hawking
they
met
full
in
the
centre
of
the
bridge
and
the
prince
seeing
de
m√©rosailles
dressed
all
in
black
from
the
feather
in
his
hat
to
his
boots
called
out
mockingly
who
is
to
be
buried
my
lord
and
whither
do
you
ride
to
the
funeral
it
can
not
be
yourself
for
i
see
that
you
are
marvellously
recovered
of
your
sickness
but
it
is
myself
answered
the
marquis
coming
near
and
speaking
low
that
the
servants
and
the
falconers
might
not
overhear
i
ride
sir
to
my
own
funeral
the
jest
is
still
afoot
then
asked
the
prince
yet
i
do
not
see
my
sister
at
the
window
to
watch
you
go
and
i
warrant
you
have
made
no
way
with
your
wager
yet
a
thousand
curses
on
my
wager
cried
the
marquis
yes
i
have
made
way
with
the
accursed
thing
and
that
is
why
i
now
go
to
my
death
what
has
she
kissed
you
cried
the
prince
with
a
merry
astonished
laugh
yes
sir
she
has
kissed
me
once
and
therefore
i
go
to
die
i
have
heard
of
many
a
better
reason
then
answered
the
prince
by
now
the
prince
had
dismounted
and
he
stood
by
de
m√©rosailles
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
and
heard
from
him
how
the
trick
had
prospered
at
this
he
was
much
tickled
and
alas
he
was
even
more
diverted
when
the
penitence
of
the
marquis
was
revealed
to
him
and
was
most
of
all
moved
to
merriment
when
it
appeared
that
the
marquis
having
gone
too
near
the
candle
had
been
caught
by
its
flame
and
was
so
terribly
singed
and
scorched
that
he
could
not
bear
to
live
and
while
they
talked
on
the
bridge
the
princess
looked
out
on
them
from
a
lofty
narrow
window
but
neither
of
them
saw
her
but
when
the
prince
had
done
laughing
he
put
his
arm
through
his
friend
and
bade
him
not
be
a
fool
but
come
in
and
toast
the
princess
kiss
in
a
draught
of
wine
for
he
said
though
you
will
never
get
the
other
two
yet
it
is
a
brave
exploit
to
have
got
one
but
the
marquis
shook
his
head
and
his
air
was
so
resolute
and
so
full
of
sorrow
that
not
only
was
rudolf
alarmed
for
his
reason
but
princess
osra
also
at
the
window
wondered
what
ailed
him
and
why
he
wore
such
a
long
face
and
now
she
noticed
that
he
was
dressed
all
in
black
and
that
his
horse
waited
for
him
across
the
bridge
not
said
she
that
i
care
what
becomes
of
the
impudent
rogue
yet
she
did
not
leave
the
window
but
watched
very
intently
to
see
what
de
m√©rosailles
would
do
for
a
long
while
he
talked
with
rudolf
on
the
bridge
rudolf
seeming
more
serious
than
he
was
wont
to
be
and
at
last
the
marquis
bent
to
kiss
the
prince
hand
and
the
prince
raised
him
and
kissed
him
on
either
cheek
then
the
marquis
went
and
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
off
slowly
and
unattended
into
the
glades
of
the
forest
of
zenda
but
the
prince
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
frown
on
his
brow
entered
under
the
portcullis
and
disappeared
from
his
sister
view
upon
this
the
princess
assuming
an
air
of
great
carelessness
walked
down
from
the
room
where
she
was
and
found
her
brother
sitting
still
in
his
boots
and
drinking
wine
and
she
said
de
m√©rosailles
has
taken
his
leave
then
even
so
madame
rejoined
rudolf
then
she
broke
into
a
fierce
attack
on
the
marquis
and
on
her
brother
also
for
a
man
said
she
is
known
by
his
friends
and
what
a
man
rudolf
must
be
to
have
a
friend
like
the
marquis
de
m√©rosailles
most
brothers
she
said
in
fiery
temper
would
make
him
answer
for
what
he
has
done
with
his
life
but
you
laugh
nay
i
daresay
you
had
a
hand
in
it
as
to
this
last
charge
the
prince
had
the
discretion
to
say
nothing
he
chose
rather
to
answer
the
first
part
of
what
she
said
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
again
rejoined
the
fool
saves
me
the
trouble
for
he
has
gone
off
to
kill
himself
to
kill
himself
she
said
half
incredulous
but
also
half
believing
because
of
the
marquis
gloomy
looks
and
black
clothes
to
kill
himself
repeated
rudolf
for
in
the
first
place
you
are
angry
so
he
can
not
live
in
the
second
he
has
behaved
like
a
rogue
so
he
can
not
live
and
in
the
third
place
you
are
so
lovely
sister
that
he
can
not
live
and
in
the
first
second
and
third
places
he
is
a
fool
so
he
can
not
live
and
the
prince
finished
his
flagon
of
wine
with
every
sign
of
in
his
manner
he
is
well
dead
she
cried
oh
as
you
please
said
he
he
is
not
the
first
brave
man
who
has
died
on
your
account
and
he
rose
and
strode
out
of
the
room
very
surlily
for
he
had
a
great
friendship
for
de
m√©rosailles
and
had
no
patience
with
men
who
let
love
make
dead
bones
of
them
the
princess
osra
being
left
alone
sat
for
a
little
time
in
deep
thought
there
rose
before
her
mind
the
picture
of
de
m√©rosailles
riding
mournfully
through
the
gloom
of
the
forest
to
his
death
and
although
his
conduct
had
been
all
and
more
than
all
that
she
had
called
it
yet
it
seemed
hard
that
he
should
die
for
it
moreover
if
he
now
in
truth
felt
what
he
had
before
feigned
the
present
truth
was
an
atonement
for
the
past
treachery
and
she
said
to
herself
that
she
could
not
sleep
quietly
that
night
if
the
marquis
killed
himself
in
the
forest
presently
she
wandered
slowly
up
to
her
chamber
and
looked
in
the
mirror
and
murmured
low
poor
fellow
and
then
with
sudden
speed
she
attired
herself
for
riding
and
commanded
her
horse
to
be
saddled
and
darted
down
the
stairs
and
across
the
bridge
and
mounted
and
forbidding
any
one
to
accompany
her
rode
away
into
the
forest
following
the
marks
of
the
hoofs
of
de
m√©rosailles
horse
it
was
then
late
afternoon
and
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
striking
through
the
reddened
her
face
as
she
rode
along
spurring
her
horse
and
following
hard
on
the
track
of
the
forlorn
gentleman
but
what
she
intended
to
do
if
she
came
up
with
him
she
did
not
think
when
she
had
ridden
an
hour
or
more
she
saw
his
horse
tethered
to
a
trunk
and
there
was
a
ring
of
trees
and
bushes
near
encircling
an
open
grassy
spot
herself
dismounting
and
fastening
her
horse
by
the
marquis
horse
she
stole
up
and
saw
de
m√©rosailles
sitting
on
the
ground
his
drawn
sword
lying
beside
him
and
his
back
was
towards
her
she
held
her
breath
and
waited
a
few
moments
then
he
took
up
the
sword
and
felt
the
point
and
also
the
edge
of
it
and
sighed
deeply
and
the
princess
thought
that
this
sorrowful
mood
became
him
better
than
any
she
had
seen
him
in
before
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
took
his
sword
by
the
blade
beneath
the
hilt
and
turned
the
point
of
it
towards
his
heart
but
osra
fearing
that
the
deed
would
be
done
immediately
called
out
eagerly
my
lord
my
lord
and
de
m√©rosailles
turned
round
with
a
great
start
when
he
saw
her
he
stood
in
astonishment
his
hand
still
holding
the
blade
of
the
sword
and
standing
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
trees
she
said
illustration
she
saw
de
m√©rosailles
sitting
on
the
ground
is
your
offence
against
me
to
be
cured
by
adding
an
offence
against
heaven
and
the
church
and
she
looked
on
him
with
great
severity
yet
her
cheek
was
flushed
and
after
a
while
she
did
not
meet
his
glance
how
came
you
here
madame
he
asked
in
wonder
i
heard
she
said
that
you
meditated
this
great
sin
and
i
rode
after
you
to
forbid
it
can
you
forbid
what
you
cause
he
asked
i
am
not
the
cause
of
it
she
said
but
your
own
trickery
it
is
true
i
am
not
worthy
to
live
cried
the
marquis
smiting
the
hilt
of
his
sword
on
the
ground
i
pray
you
madame
leave
me
alone
to
die
for
i
can
not
tear
myself
from
the
world
so
long
as
i
see
your
face
and
as
he
spoke
he
knelt
on
one
knee
as
though
he
were
doing
homage
to
her
the
princess
caught
at
the
bough
of
the
tree
under
which
she
stood
and
pulled
the
bough
down
so
that
its
leaves
half
hid
her
face
and
the
marquis
saw
little
more
than
her
eyes
from
among
the
foliage
thus
being
better
able
to
speak
to
him
she
said
softly
and
dare
you
die
unforgiven
i
had
prayed
for
forgiveness
before
you
found
me
madame
said
he
of
heaven
my
lord
of
heaven
madame
for
of
heaven
i
dare
to
ask
it
the
bough
swayed
up
and
down
now
osra
gleaming
hair
and
now
her
cheek
and
always
her
eyes
were
seen
through
the
leaves
and
presently
the
marquis
heard
a
voice
asking
does
heaven
forgive
unasked
indeed
no
he
said
wondering
and
she
said
are
we
poor
mortals
kinder
than
heaven
the
marquis
rose
and
took
a
step
or
two
towards
where
the
bough
swayed
up
and
down
and
then
knelt
again
a
great
sinner
said
he
can
not
believe
himself
forgiven
then
he
wrongs
the
power
of
which
he
seeks
forgiveness
for
forgiveness
is
divine
then
i
will
ask
it
and
if
i
obtain
it
i
shall
die
happy
again
the
bough
swayed
and
osra
said
nay
if
you
will
die
you
may
die
unforgiven
de
m√©rosailles
hearing
these
words
sprang
to
his
feet
and
came
towards
the
bough
until
he
was
so
close
that
he
touched
the
green
leaves
through
them
the
eyes
of
osra
gleamed
the
sun
rays
struck
on
her
eyes
and
they
danced
in
the
sun
and
her
cheeks
were
reddened
by
the
same
or
some
other
cause
and
the
evening
was
very
still
and
there
were
no
sounds
in
the
forest
i
can
not
believe
that
you
forgive
the
crime
is
so
great
said
he
it
was
great
yet
i
forgive
i
can
not
believe
it
said
he
again
and
he
looked
at
the
point
of
his
sword
and
then
he
looked
through
the
leaves
at
the
princess
i
can
not
do
more
than
say
that
if
you
will
live
i
will
forgive
and
we
will
forget
by
heaven
no
he
whispered
if
i
must
forget
to
be
forgiven
then
i
will
remember
and
be
unforgiven
the
faintest
laugh
reached
him
from
among
the
foliage
then
i
will
forget
and
you
shall
be
forgiven
said
she
the
marquis
put
up
his
hand
and
held
a
leaf
aside
and
he
said
again
i
can
not
believe
myself
forgiven
is
there
no
token
of
forgiveness
pray
my
lord
do
not
put
the
leaves
aside
i
still
must
die
unless
i
have
sure
warrant
of
forgiveness
ah
you
try
to
make
me
think
that
by
heaven
it
is
true
and
again
he
pointed
his
sword
at
his
heart
and
he
swore
on
his
honour
that
unless
she
gave
him
a
token
he
would
still
kill
himself
oh
said
the
princess
with
great
petulance
i
wish
i
had
not
come
then
i
should
have
been
dead
by
now
dead
unforgiven
but
you
will
still
die
yes
i
must
still
die
unless
sheathe
your
sword
my
lord
the
sun
strikes
it
and
it
dazzles
my
eyes
that
can
not
be
for
your
eyes
are
brighter
than
sun
and
sword
together
then
i
must
shade
them
with
the
leaves
yes
shade
them
with
the
leaves
he
whispered
madame
is
there
no
token
of
forgiveness
in
the
silence
that
followed
his
eyes
spoke
at
last
she
said
why
did
you
swear
on
your
honour
because
it
is
an
oath
that
i
can
not
break
indeed
i
wish
that
i
had
not
come
sighed
princess
osra
again
came
silence
the
bough
was
pressed
down
for
an
instant
then
it
swayed
swiftly
up
again
and
its
leaves
brushed
the
cheek
of
de
m√©rosailles
and
he
laughed
loudly
and
joyfully
something
touched
my
cheek
said
he
it
must
have
been
a
leaf
said
princess
osra
ah
a
leaf
i
think
so
said
princess
osra
then
it
was
a
leaf
of
the
tree
of
life
said
de
m√©rosailles
i
wish
some
one
would
set
me
on
my
horse
said
osra
that
you
may
ride
back
to
the
castle
alone
yes
unless
you
would
relieve
my
brother
anxiety
it
would
be
courteous
to
do
that
much
said
the
marquis
so
they
mounted
and
rode
back
through
the
forest
in
an
hour
the
princess
had
come
and
in
the
space
of
something
over
two
hours
they
returned
yet
during
all
this
time
they
spoke
hardly
a
word
and
although
the
sun
was
now
set
yet
the
glow
remained
on
the
face
and
in
the
eyes
of
princess
osra
while
de
m√©rosailles
being
forgiven
rode
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
but
when
they
came
to
the
castle
prince
rudolf
ran
out
to
meet
them
and
he
cried
almost
before
he
reached
them
hasten
hasten
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
if
the
marquis
values
life
or
liberty
and
when
he
came
to
them
he
told
them
that
a
had
been
false
to
de
m√©rosailles
and
after
taking
his
money
had
hid
herself
in
his
chamber
and
seen
the
first
kiss
that
the
princess
gave
him
and
having
made
some
pretext
to
gain
a
holiday
had
gone
to
the
king
who
was
hunting
near
and
betrayed
the
whole
matter
to
him
and
one
of
my
gentlemen
he
continued
has
ridden
here
to
tell
me
in
an
hour
the
guards
will
be
here
and
if
the
king
catches
you
my
lord
you
will
hang
as
sure
as
i
live
the
princess
turned
very
pale
but
de
m√©rosailles
said
haughtily
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
but
the
king
dares
not
hang
me
for
i
am
a
gentleman
and
a
subject
of
the
king
of
france
man
man
cried
rudolf
the
lion
will
hang
you
first
and
think
of
all
that
afterwards
come
now
it
is
dusk
you
shall
dress
yourself
as
my
groom
and
i
will
ride
to
the
frontier
and
you
shall
ride
behind
me
and
thus
you
may
get
safe
away
i
can
not
have
you
hanged
over
such
a
trifle
i
would
have
given
my
life
willingly
for
what
you
call
a
trifle
sir
said
the
marquis
with
a
bow
to
osra
then
have
the
trifle
and
life
too
said
rudolf
derisively
come
in
with
me
and
i
will
give
you
your
livery
when
the
prince
and
de
m√©rosailles
came
out
again
on
the
drawbridge
the
evening
had
fallen
and
it
was
dark
their
horses
stood
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
by
the
horses
stood
the
princess
quick
said
she
for
a
peasant
who
came
in
bringing
a
load
of
wood
saw
a
troop
of
men
coming
over
the
crown
of
the
hill
and
he
says
they
are
the
king
guard
mount
man
cried
the
prince
to
de
m√©rosailles
who
was
now
dressed
as
a
groom
perhaps
we
can
get
clear
or
perhaps
they
will
not
dare
to
stop
me
but
the
marquis
hesitated
a
little
for
he
did
not
like
to
run
away
but
the
princess
ran
a
little
forward
and
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
cried
see
there
i
see
the
gleam
of
steel
in
the
dark
they
have
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
are
riding
down
then
prince
rudolf
sprang
on
his
horse
calling
again
to
de
m√©rosailles
quick
quick
your
life
hangs
on
it
then
at
last
the
marquis
though
he
was
most
reluctant
to
depart
was
about
to
spring
on
his
horse
when
the
princess
turned
and
glided
back
swiftly
to
them
and
let
it
be
remembered
that
evening
had
fallen
thick
and
black
she
came
to
her
brother
and
put
out
her
hand
and
grasped
his
hand
and
said
my
lord
i
forgive
your
wrong
and
i
thank
you
for
your
courtesy
and
i
wish
you
farewell
prince
rudolf
astonished
gazed
at
her
without
speaking
but
she
moving
very
quickly
in
spite
of
the
darkness
ran
to
where
de
m√©rosailles
was
about
to
spring
on
his
horse
and
she
flung
one
arm
lightly
about
his
neck
and
she
said
farewell
dear
brother
god
preserve
you
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
my
good
friend
de
m√©rosailles
and
she
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
cheek
then
she
suddenly
gave
a
loud
cry
of
dismay
exclaiming
alas
what
have
i
done
ah
what
have
i
done
and
she
hid
her
face
in
her
two
hands
prince
rudolf
burst
into
a
loud
short
laugh
yet
he
said
nothing
to
his
sister
but
again
urged
the
marquis
to
mount
his
horse
and
the
marquis
who
was
in
a
sad
tumult
of
triumph
and
of
woe
leapt
up
and
they
rode
out
and
turning
their
faces
towards
the
forest
set
spurs
to
their
horses
and
vanished
at
a
breakneck
speed
into
the
glades
and
no
sooner
were
they
gone
than
the
troopers
of
the
king
guard
clattered
at
a
canter
up
to
the
end
of
the
bridge
where
the
princess
osra
stood
but
when
their
captain
saw
the
princess
he
drew
rein
what
is
your
errand
sir
she
asked
most
coldly
and
haughtily
madame
we
are
ordered
to
bring
the
marquis
de
m√©rosailles
alive
or
dead
into
the
king
presence
and
we
have
information
that
he
is
in
the
castle
unless
indeed
he
were
one
of
the
horsemen
who
rode
away
just
now
the
horsemen
you
saw
were
my
brother
the
prince
and
his
groom
said
osra
but
if
you
think
that
de
m√©rosailles
is
in
the
castle
pray
search
the
castle
from
keep
to
cellar
and
if
you
find
him
carry
him
to
my
father
according
to
your
orders
then
the
troopers
dismounted
in
great
haste
and
ransacked
the
castle
from
keep
to
cellar
and
they
found
the
clothes
of
the
marquis
and
the
white
powder
with
which
he
had
whitened
his
face
but
the
marquis
they
did
not
find
so
the
captain
came
again
to
the
princess
who
still
stood
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
said
madame
he
is
not
in
the
castle
is
he
not
said
she
and
turned
away
and
walking
to
the
middle
of
the
bridge
looked
down
into
the
water
of
the
moat
was
it
in
truth
the
prince
groom
who
rode
with
him
madame
asked
the
captain
following
her
in
truth
sir
it
was
so
dark
answered
the
princess
that
i
could
not
myself
clearly
distinguish
the
man
face
one
was
the
prince
for
i
saw
you
embrace
him
madame
you
do
well
to
conclude
that
that
was
my
brother
said
osra
smiling
a
little
and
to
the
other
madame
you
gave
your
hand
and
now
i
give
it
to
you
said
she
with
haughty
insolence
and
if
to
my
father
servant
why
not
to
my
brother
and
she
held
out
her
hand
that
he
might
kiss
it
and
turned
away
from
him
and
looked
down
into
the
water
again
but
we
found
de
m√©rosailles
clothes
in
the
castle
persisted
the
captain
he
may
well
have
left
something
of
his
in
the
castle
said
the
princess
i
will
ride
after
them
cried
the
captain
i
doubt
if
you
will
catch
them
smiled
the
princess
for
by
now
the
pair
had
been
gone
half
an
hour
and
the
frontier
was
but
ten
miles
from
the
castle
and
they
could
not
be
overtaken
yet
the
captain
rode
off
with
his
men
and
pursued
till
he
met
prince
rudolf
returning
alone
having
seen
de
m√©rosailles
safe
on
his
way
and
rudolf
had
paid
the
sum
of
a
thousand
crowns
to
the
marquis
so
that
the
fugitive
was
well
provided
for
his
journey
and
travelling
with
many
relays
of
horses
made
good
his
escape
from
the
clutches
of
king
henry
but
the
princess
osra
stayed
a
long
time
looking
down
at
the
water
in
the
moat
sometimes
she
sighed
and
then
again
she
frowned
and
although
nobody
was
there
and
it
was
very
dark
into
the
bargain
more
than
once
she
blushed
and
at
last
she
turned
to
go
into
the
castle
but
as
she
went
she
murmured
softly
to
herself
why
i
kissed
him
the
first
time
i
know
it
was
in
pity
and
why
i
kissed
him
the
second
time
i
know
it
was
in
forgiveness
but
why
i
kissed
him
the
third
time
or
what
that
kiss
meant
said
osra
heaven
knows
and
she
went
in
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
chapter
iii
the
madness
of
lord
harry
culverhouse
seeing
that
my
father
henry
is
dead
and
that
i
am
king
seeing
also
that
i
am
no
longer
a
bachelor
but
a
married
man
and
here
he
bowed
to
margaret
of
tuscany
his
newly
wedded
wife
and
seeing
that
turned
twenty
years
of
age
why
we
are
all
to
be
sober
folk
at
strelsau
from
this
day
forward
and
we
are
to
play
no
more
pranks
here
a
pledge
to
it
and
having
said
this
king
rudolf
iii
took
a
deep
draught
of
wine
at
this
moment
the
ushers
announced
that
the
lord
harry
culverhouse
had
come
to
take
his
leave
of
their
majesties
and
of
the
princess
this
gentleman
had
accompanied
the
embassy
that
came
from
england
to
congratulate
the
king
on
his
marriage
and
he
had
stayed
some
months
in
strelsau
very
eagerly
acceding
to
the
king
invitation
to
prolong
his
visit
for
such
were
his
folly
and
headstrong
passion
that
he
had
fallen
most
desperately
in
love
with
the
fair
face
of
princess
osra
and
could
not
endure
to
live
out
of
her
presence
yet
now
he
came
to
bid
farewell
and
when
he
was
ushered
in
rudolf
received
him
with
much
graciousness
and
made
him
a
present
of
his
own
miniature
set
in
diamonds
while
the
queen
gave
him
her
miniature
set
in
the
lid
of
a
golden
casket
in
return
lord
harry
prayed
the
king
to
accept
a
sword
and
the
queen
an
ivory
fan
painted
by
the
greatest
artist
of
france
and
bearing
her
cipher
in
jewels
then
he
came
to
princess
osra
and
she
having
bidden
him
farewell
said
i
am
a
poor
maid
my
lord
and
i
can
give
no
great
gift
but
take
this
pin
from
my
hair
and
keep
it
for
my
sake
and
she
drew
out
a
golden
pin
from
her
hair
a
long
and
sharp
pin
bearing
for
its
head
her
cipher
in
brilliants
and
she
gave
it
to
him
smiling
but
he
bowing
low
and
then
falling
on
his
knee
offered
her
a
box
of
red
morocco
leather
and
when
she
opened
it
she
saw
a
necklace
of
rubies
of
great
splendour
the
princess
flushed
red
seeing
that
the
gift
was
most
costly
and
she
would
fain
have
refused
it
and
held
it
out
again
to
lord
harry
but
he
turned
swiftly
away
and
bowing
once
more
withdrew
then
the
princess
said
to
her
brother
it
is
too
costly
the
king
seeing
how
splendid
the
gift
was
frowned
a
little
and
then
said
he
must
be
a
man
of
very
great
wealth
they
are
rich
in
england
i
am
sorry
the
gift
is
so
great
but
we
can
not
refuse
it
without
wounding
his
honour
so
the
princess
set
the
ruby
necklace
with
her
other
jewels
and
thought
for
a
day
or
two
that
lord
harry
was
no
wiser
than
other
men
and
then
forgot
him
now
lord
harry
culverhouse
on
leaving
the
king
presence
had
mounted
his
horse
which
was
a
fine
charger
and
splendidly
equipped
and
ridden
alone
out
of
strelsau
for
he
had
dismissed
all
his
servants
and
despatched
them
with
suitable
gratuities
to
their
own
country
he
rode
through
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
he
reached
a
village
fifteen
miles
away
here
he
stopped
at
a
cottage
and
an
old
man
came
out
and
escorted
him
in
a
bundle
lay
on
the
table
in
the
little
parlour
of
the
cottage
here
are
the
clothes
my
lord
said
the
old
man
laying
his
hand
on
the
bundle
and
here
are
mine
answered
lord
harry
and
the
horse
stands
ready
for
you
with
this
he
began
to
pull
off
the
fine
clothes
in
which
he
had
had
audience
of
the
king
and
he
opened
the
bundle
and
put
on
the
old
and
plain
suit
which
it
contained
then
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
old
man
saying
give
me
the
five
crowns
solomon
and
our
bargain
is
complete
then
solomon
the
jew
gave
him
five
crowns
and
bade
him
farewell
and
he
placed
the
crowns
in
his
purse
and
walked
out
of
the
cottage
possessing
nothing
in
the
world
saving
his
old
clothes
five
crowns
and
the
golden
pin
that
had
fastened
the
ruddy
hair
of
princess
osra
for
everything
else
that
he
had
possessed
his
lands
and
houses
in
england
his
horses
and
carriages
his
money
his
clothes
and
all
that
was
his
he
had
bartered
with
solomon
the
jew
in
order
that
he
might
buy
the
ruby
necklace
which
he
had
given
to
princess
osra
such
was
the
strange
madness
wrought
in
him
by
her
face
it
was
now
late
evening
and
he
walked
to
and
fro
all
night
in
the
morning
he
went
to
the
shop
of
a
barber
and
in
return
for
one
of
his
crowns
the
barber
cropped
his
long
curls
short
and
shaved
off
his
moustaches
and
gave
him
a
dye
with
which
he
stained
his
complexion
to
a
darker
tint
and
he
made
his
face
dirty
and
soiled
his
hands
and
roughened
the
skin
of
them
by
chafing
them
on
some
flints
which
lay
by
the
roadside
then
changing
a
second
crown
he
bought
a
loaf
of
bread
and
set
off
to
trudge
to
strelsau
for
in
strelsau
was
osra
and
he
would
not
be
anywhere
else
in
the
world
and
when
he
had
arrived
there
he
went
to
a
sergeant
of
the
king
guard
and
prevailed
on
him
by
a
present
of
three
crowns
to
enlist
him
as
a
trooper
and
this
the
sergeant
having
found
that
lord
harry
could
ride
and
knew
how
to
use
his
sword
agreed
to
do
thus
lord
harry
became
a
trooper
in
the
guard
of
king
rudolf
having
for
all
his
possessions
save
what
the
stores
afforded
him
a
few
pence
and
the
golden
pin
that
had
fastened
the
hair
of
princess
osra
but
nobody
knew
him
except
solomon
the
jew
and
he
having
made
a
good
profit
held
his
peace
both
then
and
afterwards
many
a
day
lord
harry
mounted
guard
at
the
palace
and
often
he
saw
the
king
with
the
queen
ride
out
and
back
but
they
did
not
notice
the
face
of
the
trooper
sometimes
he
saw
the
princess
also
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
although
he
could
not
restrain
himself
from
looking
at
her
but
since
every
man
looked
at
her
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
being
gazed
at
and
took
no
heed
of
it
but
once
she
wore
the
ruby
necklace
and
the
breath
of
the
trooper
went
quick
and
eager
when
he
saw
it
on
her
neck
and
a
sudden
flush
of
colour
spread
over
all
his
face
so
that
the
princess
chancing
to
glance
at
him
in
passing
and
seeing
the
colour
beneath
and
through
the
dye
that
stained
him
was
greatly
astonished
and
she
reined
in
her
horse
for
an
instant
and
looked
very
intently
at
him
yet
she
rode
on
again
in
silence
that
evening
there
came
to
the
quarters
of
the
king
guard
a
who
asked
to
see
the
trooper
who
had
mounted
guard
at
the
west
gate
of
the
palace
that
day
and
when
he
came
the
woman
held
out
to
him
a
box
of
red
morocco
leather
saying
it
is
for
you
but
he
answered
it
is
not
for
me
and
turning
away
left
her
and
this
happened
on
three
evenings
then
on
the
fourth
day
it
was
again
his
turn
to
mount
guard
at
the
palace
and
when
he
had
sat
there
on
his
horse
for
an
hour
the
princess
osra
rode
out
from
under
the
portico
she
rode
alone
and
the
ruby
necklace
was
on
her
neck
and
she
said
i
am
going
to
ride
outside
the
city
by
the
river
bank
let
a
trooper
follow
me
some
way
behind
and
she
signed
with
her
hand
to
lord
harry
and
he
rode
after
her
through
the
streets
and
out
of
the
western
gate
and
they
turned
along
the
bank
of
the
river
when
they
had
gone
three
or
four
miles
from
the
city
osra
halted
and
beckoned
to
lord
harry
to
approach
her
and
he
came
but
when
she
was
about
to
speak
to
him
and
tell
him
that
she
knew
him
a
sudden
new
madness
came
on
him
he
seized
her
bridle
and
dug
his
spurs
deep
into
his
horse
flanks
and
the
horse
bounded
forward
at
a
gallop
in
alarm
the
princess
cried
out
but
he
did
not
heed
her
along
the
bank
they
galloped
and
when
they
met
any
one
which
happened
seldom
for
the
place
was
remote
and
it
was
now
evening
he
bade
her
cover
her
face
and
she
obeyed
twisting
her
lace
handkerchief
about
her
face
thus
they
rode
till
they
came
at
nightfall
to
a
bluff
of
rock
high
above
the
stream
here
lord
harry
suddenly
checked
the
horses
flung
himself
from
his
saddle
and
bade
the
princess
dismount
she
obeyed
and
stood
facing
him
pale
with
fear
and
apprehension
but
wearing
a
proud
and
scornful
air
and
he
cried
is
it
not
well
you
should
die
for
you
live
but
to
madden
men
and
drive
them
to
sin
and
folly
nay
said
she
to
men
of
good
heart
beauty
leads
to
goodness
from
yourself
come
the
sin
and
folly
my
lord
and
she
laid
hold
of
the
ruby
necklace
and
broke
the
clasp
of
it
and
flung
it
on
the
ground
before
him
he
took
no
heed
of
it
but
seized
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
the
edge
of
the
bluff
saying
the
world
will
be
safer
if
i
fling
you
down
then
she
looked
in
his
face
and
a
sudden
pity
entered
into
her
heart
and
she
said
very
gently
sit
down
my
lord
and
let
me
put
my
hands
on
your
brow
for
i
think
you
are
in
a
fever
he
sat
down
all
trembling
and
shaking
like
a
man
with
ague
and
she
stripped
off
her
gauntlets
and
took
his
forehead
between
her
hands
and
he
lay
there
quiet
with
his
head
between
her
hands
presently
his
eyes
closed
and
he
slept
but
osra
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
darkness
had
fallen
and
she
dared
not
leave
him
alone
there
by
the
river
so
she
sat
where
she
was
and
in
an
hour
the
night
being
fine
and
not
cold
she
grew
weary
her
hands
fell
away
from
his
brow
and
she
sank
back
on
the
green
turf
pillowing
her
head
on
a
curved
arm
and
there
she
slept
with
the
mad
lord
by
her
and
the
ruby
necklace
lying
near
them
at
midnight
lord
harry
culverhouse
awoke
and
saw
princess
osra
sleeping
peacefully
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
such
as
decks
a
child
in
sleep
he
rose
and
stood
up
on
his
feet
looking
at
her
and
he
heard
nothing
but
the
sound
of
the
horses
cropping
the
grass
a
little
way
off
then
he
drew
near
her
and
gazed
long
on
her
face
and
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
him
she
smiled
at
him
and
she
said
even
here
i
am
guarded
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
guard
me
in
the
palace
and
she
closed
her
eyes
again
and
turned
to
sleep
a
shiver
ran
through
him
he
dug
his
nails
into
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
turning
walked
swiftly
up
and
down
on
the
bluff
by
the
side
of
the
river
while
osra
slept
presently
he
fell
on
his
knees
beside
her
beginning
to
murmur
in
a
rapid
rush
of
words
but
he
did
not
now
curse
her
beauty
but
blessed
god
for
it
and
blessed
him
also
for
the
preservation
of
his
own
honour
thus
he
spent
the
night
till
day
was
near
then
he
bent
over
osra
and
looked
once
more
on
her
and
he
took
up
the
ruby
necklace
and
laid
it
lightly
about
her
neck
feeling
the
touch
of
it
cool
and
wet
from
the
dew
she
again
opened
her
eyes
and
putting
her
knuckles
in
them
she
rubbed
gently
and
she
gasped
a
gentle
yawn
saying
heigho
i
am
sleepy
and
sat
up
and
she
said
are
you
not
sleepy
my
lord
i
am
on
watch
madame
said
lord
harry
culverhouse
as
the
princess
sat
up
the
ruby
necklace
fell
from
her
neck
into
her
lap
seeing
it
she
held
it
up
to
him
saying
take
it
again
and
go
to
your
own
home
i
am
sure
you
gave
too
great
a
price
for
it
he
smiled
for
she
did
not
know
how
great
the
price
was
and
he
asked
must
i
in
my
turn
give
back
the
pin
that
fastened
your
hair
no
keep
the
pin
it
is
worth
nothing
she
smiled
is
it
safe
for
me
to
go
to
sleep
a
little
longer
who
would
harm
you
madame
even
i
have
not
harmed
you
you
said
she
with
a
little
laugh
you
would
not
harm
me
and
she
lay
down
again
and
closed
her
eyes
then
lord
harry
culverhouse
sat
down
on
the
ground
resting
his
chin
on
his
knees
and
clasping
his
hands
about
his
shins
and
he
cursed
himself
bitterly
not
now
because
he
meditated
any
harm
to
her
for
his
hot
fury
was
past
and
he
would
have
died
before
a
hair
of
her
head
should
be
hurt
but
because
of
the
evil
that
his
wild
and
reckless
madness
had
brought
upon
her
for
he
knew
that
soon
there
would
be
a
pursuit
and
that
if
she
and
he
were
found
there
it
would
become
known
who
he
was
and
her
fame
would
suffer
injurious
rumours
by
reason
of
what
he
had
done
therefore
he
made
up
his
mind
what
he
must
next
do
and
he
abandoned
all
the
dreams
that
had
led
him
into
the
foolish
adventure
on
which
he
had
embarked
and
put
from
him
the
wickedness
that
had
filled
his
heart
when
first
he
carried
her
to
the
bluff
over
the
river
he
rose
on
to
his
knees
and
prayed
that
if
his
deed
were
a
sin
for
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
necessary
thing
then
that
it
might
be
forgiven
but
that
in
any
case
no
hurt
or
harm
should
befall
the
princess
osra
by
reason
of
anything
that
he
had
done
finally
he
commended
his
soul
to
god
then
he
took
the
ruby
necklace
in
his
hand
and
holding
it
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
bluff
but
at
this
instant
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
struck
on
his
ear
the
sound
was
loud
and
close
and
he
had
no
more
time
than
to
turn
round
before
a
horse
was
reined
in
suddenly
by
him
and
a
man
leapt
from
it
and
ran
at
him
and
grappled
with
him
and
lord
harry
perceived
that
the
man
was
the
king
for
when
osra
did
not
return
search
parties
had
been
sent
out
the
king
himself
headed
one
and
having
the
best
horse
and
being
urged
on
by
love
and
fear
for
his
sister
he
had
outridden
all
the
rest
and
had
chanced
to
come
alone
where
osra
and
lord
harry
were
and
he
gripped
lord
harry
furiously
cursing
him
for
a
scoundrel
and
demanding
what
he
had
done
to
the
princess
then
lord
harry
said
do
you
not
know
me
sire
i
am
harry
culverhouse
greatly
astonished
the
king
loosed
his
hold
and
fell
back
a
pace
for
he
could
not
understand
what
he
heard
but
yet
knew
the
voice
of
his
friend
then
looking
down
he
beheld
osra
sleeping
peacefully
as
a
child
on
the
ground
with
her
cloak
spread
under
her
that
she
might
take
no
harm
from
the
damp
but
lord
harry
caught
him
by
the
arm
crying
are
there
others
coming
after
you
aye
said
the
king
many
others
the
whole
of
the
guard
are
roused
and
seek
her
high
and
low
in
the
city
and
outside
but
how
came
you
here
man
then
lord
harry
told
the
king
what
he
had
done
speaking
very
briefly
and
hastily
but
yet
sparing
nothing
and
when
he
told
him
how
he
had
carried
off
the
princess
the
king
hand
flew
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword
but
lord
harry
said
not
yet
and
continued
to
tell
the
king
how
osra
had
pitied
him
how
he
had
watched
by
her
and
how
she
had
slept
again
bidding
him
keep
the
pin
then
glancing
at
osra
he
lowered
his
voice
and
spoke
very
quick
and
urgently
and
the
king
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
lord
harry
hand
asking
is
there
no
other
way
but
lord
harry
shook
his
head
then
he
kissed
the
king
hand
next
he
went
and
kissed
osra
hand
very
softly
and
looked
for
the
last
time
on
her
face
and
he
drew
the
golden
pin
from
his
purse
and
he
put
it
gently
and
deftly
among
her
hair
then
taking
the
ruby
necklace
in
his
own
hand
and
clenching
it
tight
he
said
to
king
rudolf
sire
there
are
some
in
the
city
that
knew
me
before
but
have
not
known
me
since
i
have
been
in
your
guard
because
i
have
altered
my
face
take
care
that
you
so
alter
it
that
they
do
not
know
me
again
the
king
breath
caught
in
his
throat
for
he
had
loved
lord
harry
culverhouse
and
he
asked
again
is
there
no
other
way
hark
said
the
other
i
hear
the
horses
of
your
guard
drawing
near
i
hear
them
to
east
and
west
and
north
and
do
you
not
see
shapes
riding
there
to
the
south
across
the
river
if
i
ride
from
here
alive
i
shall
be
taken
and
the
truth
must
be
known
for
my
sake
and
hers
strike
sire
the
king
took
lord
harry
culverhouse
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
to
him
saying
must
it
be
so
harry
and
we
have
lived
as
friends
together
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
is
very
near
sire
the
king
drew
himself
up
to
his
height
and
he
raised
his
hat
from
his
head
and
bowed
low
to
lord
harry
culverhouse
and
he
said
now
praise
be
to
god
for
the
restoration
of
this
gentleman
to
a
sound
mind
and
may
christ
grant
him
mercy
for
the
sake
of
his
honourable
death
and
he
drew
his
sword
from
its
sheath
and
came
up
to
lord
harry
culverhouse
who
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
bluff
the
king
raised
his
sword
and
struck
with
all
his
strength
the
head
split
under
the
blow
and
lord
harry
culverhouse
fell
dead
from
the
bluff
into
the
river
holding
the
ruby
necklace
in
his
clenched
hand
but
the
king
shivered
and
a
short
sob
burst
from
him
on
this
instant
there
arose
an
eager
glad
cry
and
twenty
of
the
guard
rushed
forward
greeting
the
king
and
rejoiced
to
see
the
princess
roused
by
the
noise
of
their
coming
she
sat
up
again
rubbing
her
eyes
and
cried
where
is
he
where
is
lord
harry
and
she
looked
round
on
the
troopers
and
they
gazed
on
her
much
astonished
at
hearing
what
she
said
but
rudolf
came
to
her
and
took
her
hand
saying
why
osra
you
have
been
dreaming
there
is
no
lord
harry
here
lord
harry
culverhouse
is
far
off
in
his
own
country
did
that
rascal
of
a
trooper
frighten
you
her
eyes
grew
wide
in
wonder
but
before
she
could
speak
he
turned
to
the
guard
saying
by
heaven
pleasure
i
came
in
time
to
prevent
any
harm
except
the
loss
of
a
necklace
my
sister
wore
for
as
i
rode
up
i
saw
a
fellow
stooping
down
by
her
and
fumbling
with
the
clasp
of
her
necklace
he
was
one
of
your
troop
and
had
ridden
out
behind
her
and
he
must
have
carried
her
off
by
force
now
he
was
endeavouring
to
rob
her
and
as
i
rode
up
to
him
he
sprang
away
from
her
holding
her
necklace
in
his
hand
but
i
leapt
down
from
my
horse
and
ran
at
him
and
he
retreated
in
fear
then
i
drew
my
sword
and
drove
him
back
to
the
edge
of
the
bluff
and
then
i
split
his
skull
and
he
fell
into
the
river
still
holding
the
necklace
but
thanks
to
god
the
princess
is
not
hurt
let
search
be
made
for
the
fellow
body
for
perhaps
the
necklace
will
be
still
in
his
hand
but
one
cried
how
came
they
here
ah
sister
said
the
king
fixing
his
eyes
on
osra
how
came
you
here
reading
in
the
king
eyes
the
answer
that
he
would
have
she
said
the
trooper
compelled
me
to
come
hither
with
him
and
he
threatened
to
kill
me
if
i
would
not
give
him
my
necklace
but
i
refused
then
he
drew
a
knife
and
menaced
me
with
it
and
i
fell
into
a
swoon
and
knew
no
more
until
i
awoke
and
found
you
here
and
now
i
see
that
my
necklace
is
gone
bring
her
horse
the
king
commanded
and
ride
in
front
and
behind
we
will
return
to
the
city
at
the
best
speed
we
may
then
he
mounted
the
princess
on
her
horse
and
rode
by
her
side
supporting
her
with
his
arm
and
the
troopers
were
some
way
off
in
front
and
behind
but
the
princess
felt
the
pin
again
in
her
hair
and
putting
up
her
hand
she
pulled
it
out
and
she
said
he
has
given
me
back
my
pin
of
whom
do
you
speak
asked
the
king
of
lord
harry
culverhouse
is
he
indeed
dead
rudolf
are
you
indeed
still
dreaming
answered
the
king
with
a
laugh
what
had
that
fellow
to
do
with
harry
culverhouse
but
the
pin
she
cried
my
wife
set
it
in
your
hair
before
you
started
for
she
wished
to
replace
the
one
you
gave
to
lord
harry
she
did
not
touch
my
hair
cried
the
princess
aye
but
she
did
said
he
the
princess
suddenly
fell
to
sobbing
and
she
said
tell
me
the
truth
tell
me
the
truth
surely
it
was
in
truth
lord
harry
culverhouse
then
rudolf
drew
very
close
to
her
and
said
softly
sweet
sister
the
noble
gentleman
whom
we
knew
he
whom
i
loved
and
who
loved
you
in
chivalrous
deference
went
from
us
two
months
ago
be
not
troubled
about
him
for
now
all
is
well
with
him
but
there
was
an
unhappy
man
with
you
who
was
not
our
harry
culverhouse
and
who
had
murderous
and
mad
thoughts
in
his
heart
yet
at
the
end
he
also
died
as
readily
and
as
nobly
as
our
dear
friend
himself
would
have
died
for
your
sake
i
pray
you
ask
no
more
of
him
but
be
contented
to
know
that
though
he
died
by
the
sword
yet
he
died
in
peace
and
willingly
but
of
our
dear
friend
as
we
knew
him
think
as
much
as
you
will
for
the
love
of
an
honest
gentleman
is
a
good
thing
to
think
of
the
princess
osra
hearing
this
laid
her
hand
in
her
brother
hand
and
for
a
long
while
she
did
not
speak
then
she
said
but
our
friend
will
not
come
again
rudolf
no
you
will
never
see
our
friend
again
answered
the
king
then
when
you
see
him
for
i
think
you
will
see
him
once
again
lay
this
pin
in
his
hand
and
bid
him
take
and
keep
it
for
the
sake
of
the
love
i
bear
him
perhaps
he
will
hear
you
it
may
be
i
can
not
tell
said
the
king
and
if
he
has
the
necklace
said
she
pray
him
to
give
that
to
you
and
sell
it
rudolf
and
give
the
value
of
it
in
gifts
to
the
poor
yes
to
all
that
are
unhappy
and
afflicted
even
as
the
poor
man
who
was
with
me
so
be
it
osra
said
the
king
and
he
kissed
her
but
she
burst
again
suddenly
into
passionate
weeping
calling
god
to
witness
that
her
face
was
a
curse
to
her
and
a
curse
to
her
friends
and
praying
the
king
to
suffer
her
to
take
the
veil
in
a
convent
that
she
might
trouble
honest
men
no
more
thus
he
brought
her
in
a
sad
plight
to
the
palace
and
gave
her
into
the
arms
of
his
wife
still
sobbing
bitterly
and
he
himself
took
the
pin
and
when
the
body
of
the
mad
trooper
was
found
with
his
own
hand
he
covered
the
face
and
put
the
pin
in
the
hand
from
which
he
took
the
ruby
necklace
and
he
sold
the
necklace
and
used
the
proceeds
of
it
as
his
sister
had
desired
thus
the
madness
of
lord
harry
culverhouse
which
was
bred
in
him
by
the
beauty
of
the
princess
osra
worked
its
way
with
him
and
brought
him
first
into
peril
of
great
villainy
and
at
last
to
death
and
his
name
passed
no
more
on
the
lips
of
any
in
strelsau
nor
between
king
rudolf
and
his
sister
while
the
story
that
the
king
had
told
to
the
troopers
was
believed
by
all
and
none
save
the
king
knew
what
lord
harry
culverhouse
had
done
in
his
madness
but
osra
mourned
for
him
and
for
a
long
while
she
would
not
go
abroad
nor
receive
any
of
the
princes
or
nobles
who
came
to
the
court
but
lay
still
sick
and
full
of
grief
bewailing
the
harm
that
she
had
wrought
yet
as
time
passed
she
grew
again
happy
for
she
was
young
and
the
world
was
sweet
to
her
and
then
as
king
rudolf
had
bidden
her
she
remembered
lord
harry
culverhouse
as
he
had
been
before
his
madness
came
upon
him
yet
still
more
did
she
remember
how
even
in
his
madness
he
had
done
her
no
harm
but
had
watched
beside
her
through
the
night
and
had
as
morning
dawned
entreated
death
at
the
hands
of
the
king
preferring
to
die
rather
than
that
the
talk
of
a
single
idle
tongue
should
fall
foully
on
her
name
therefore
she
mourned
for
him
with
secret
tears
but
he
although
no
monument
marked
his
grave
and
although
men
spoke
only
of
the
mad
trooper
who
had
robbed
the
princess
yet
slept
soundly
and
at
peace
and
his
right
hand
lay
clenched
upon
his
heart
and
in
it
the
golden
pin
that
had
fastened
the
ruddy
hair
of
princess
osra
chapter
iv
the
courtesy
of
christian
the
highwayman
i
am
tired
of
men
cried
princess
osra
and
of
suitors
and
of
princes
i
will
go
to
zenda
and
ride
in
the
forest
all
alone
you
will
meet
men
even
there
said
the
king
how
do
you
know
that
sire
she
asked
with
a
smile
at
least
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
avoid
meeting
women
anywhere
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
thing
observed
osra
smiling
again
the
king
said
no
more
but
let
her
go
her
own
way
and
to
zenda
she
went
and
rode
in
the
forest
all
alone
meeting
for
many
days
no
man
at
all
though
perhaps
she
thought
a
little
of
those
whom
she
had
met
and
who
can
tell
now
and
then
of
one
whom
she
should
some
day
meet
for
the
mind
loves
to
entertain
itself
with
such
idle
musings
and
they
are
hardly
conscious
till
a
sudden
smile
or
a
beat
of
the
heart
betrays
them
to
the
abashed
thinker
just
in
this
manner
a
flush
had
chanced
to
rise
to
osra
cheek
one
day
as
she
rode
in
a
reverie
being
above
ten
miles
from
the
castle
and
on
the
very
edge
of
the
kingdom
frontier
which
skirts
the
extremity
of
the
forest
on
the
east
breaking
off
her
thoughts
half
ashamed
of
them
she
looked
up
and
saw
a
very
fine
and
powerful
horse
tethered
to
a
tree
a
few
yards
away
saddled
and
bridled
then
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
alas
here
is
a
man
as
my
brother
said
and
she
shook
her
head
very
sorrowfully
the
next
instant
she
saw
as
she
had
foreboded
a
man
approaching
her
indeed
the
matter
was
as
bad
as
could
be
for
he
was
young
and
handsome
finely
dressed
carrying
a
good
sword
by
his
side
and
a
brace
of
pistols
mounted
in
silver
in
his
belt
he
held
a
feathered
hat
in
his
hand
and
advancing
with
a
deep
bow
knelt
on
one
knee
by
the
princess
horse
saying
madame
if
you
will
you
can
do
me
a
great
service
if
it
be
in
my
power
sir
she
answered
for
since
fate
compelled
her
to
meet
a
man
she
would
not
show
him
rudeness
i
am
at
your
service
you
see
my
horse
there
madame
he
is
as
dear
as
my
life
to
me
and
i
fear
i
shall
lose
him
unless
i
have
your
aid
and
he
rose
and
stood
looking
at
the
princess
why
what
threatens
him
she
asked
i
will
tell
you
madame
i
come
from
across
the
frontier
from
a
secluded
village
nearly
ten
miles
from
here
there
i
live
with
my
mother
whom
i
support
there
is
a
rich
fellow
there
a
farmer
otho
by
name
who
is
saving
your
presence
a
plaguey
boastful
fellow
and
he
is
to
be
betrothed
do
you
also
love
the
lady
asked
osra
thinking
she
had
come
at
the
cause
of
his
trouble
not
i
madame
but
this
otho
boasted
and
vaunted
so
intolerably
of
her
beauty
and
of
his
own
prowess
and
attraction
that
last
night
i
led
away
by
emulation
nay
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
had
also
drunk
a
flask
of
wine
wagered
with
him
my
horse
against
a
thousand
crowns
though
the
horse
is
worth
two
thousand
that
i
would
bring
with
me
to
the
feast
a
girl
handsomer
than
his
lotta
but
now
it
is
eleven
and
the
feast
is
at
one
and
i
have
no
girl
to
show
ugly
or
handsome
and
if
i
lose
my
horse
i
must
hang
myself
for
i
can
not
live
without
him
you
can
not
live
without
your
horse
she
asked
in
surprise
at
least
madame
he
answered
in
some
confusion
his
loss
would
go
near
to
breaking
my
heart
but
is
this
lotta
so
handsome
that
you
can
find
none
to
surpass
her
she
is
indeed
wonderfully
handsome
in
the
village
they
call
her
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
then
sir
it
seems
to
me
that
your
wager
was
most
improvident
and
rash
for
you
are
certain
to
lose
it
alas
yes
he
answered
in
great
distress
i
am
certain
to
lose
for
there
are
i
think
only
two
ladies
in
the
world
who
could
save
me
and
one
would
not
two
ladies
who
are
they
madame
said
he
before
you
came
in
sight
i
sat
desolate
and
despairing
on
the
ground
and
what
i
said
to
myself
was
what
men
say
is
true
there
is
only
one
lady
who
could
save
me
but
how
shall
i
poor
christian
hantz
come
at
the
princess
osra
and
would
she
put
on
a
country
girl
dress
and
go
to
the
feast
with
me
alas
it
is
impossible
and
there
is
no
other
lady
in
the
world
beautiful
enough
but
then
well
sir
what
then
asked
osra
playing
with
her
whip
and
smothering
a
smile
then
madame
said
christian
i
looked
up
and
i
saw
you
and
i
cried
fig
for
the
princess
osra
for
here
is
a
lady
more
beautiful
than
all
they
tell
of
princess
osra
i
will
throw
myself
at
her
feet
and
pray
her
in
pity
to
help
me
still
osra
hid
her
smile
and
so
busy
was
she
with
this
task
that
she
did
not
perceive
that
christian
also
hid
a
smile
but
she
thought
that
he
did
not
know
her
whereas
he
had
seen
her
several
times
and
had
this
day
tracked
her
in
the
forest
knowing
that
she
was
accustomed
to
ride
there
but
where
she
asked
would
the
lady
who
went
with
you
get
the
dress
you
speak
of
at
my
mother
cottage
madame
where
my
mother
would
wait
on
her
and
when
could
she
be
back
at
this
spot
by
five
in
the
afternoon
madame
i
would
myself
escort
her
and
why
sir
should
she
rescue
you
from
the
straits
into
which
your
folly
has
led
you
alas
madame
for
no
reason
unless
by
a
divine
miracle
she
should
prove
as
kind
as
she
is
beautiful
you
have
a
rash
tongue
sir
in
other
matters
than
the
making
of
wagers
and
she
looked
at
him
for
she
was
very
sorely
tempted
to
do
what
he
prayed
of
her
and
she
said
has
the
princess
osra
ever
ridden
through
your
village
never
madame
but
some
there
may
know
her
face
and
then
they
will
think
nothing
of
mine
it
is
unlikely
that
any
one
there
should
have
seen
even
a
picture
of
her
for
they
are
quiet
folk
and
do
not
go
abroad
besides
in
a
peasant
dress
began
osra
meditatively
but
she
stopped
blushing
and
laughing
and
christian
caught
her
hand
and
kissed
it
crying
for
heaven
sake
come
madame
he
was
so
earnest
and
his
earnestness
so
became
his
bronzed
face
and
bright
eyes
that
osra
could
not
deny
him
but
she
swore
him
to
secrecy
and
agreed
to
ride
with
him
blaming
herself
all
the
while
very
greatly
and
blaming
yet
more
that
fate
which
would
not
allow
her
to
be
quit
of
the
troublesome
race
of
men
even
in
the
recesses
of
the
forest
of
zenda
turning
their
horses
therefore
towards
the
frontier
they
set
them
at
a
smart
canter
for
there
was
little
time
to
lose
if
they
were
to
come
to
the
feast
by
one
and
shortly
before
noon
having
struck
a
through
the
trees
they
came
on
a
small
cottage
that
stood
apart
and
by
itself
and
a
hill
rose
from
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
lies
the
village
madame
said
christian
jumping
from
his
horse
and
this
is
my
cottage
hallo
there
mother
an
old
woman
came
out
neatly
and
cleanly
clad
christian
ran
up
to
her
spoke
to
her
briefly
and
brought
her
to
osra
the
worthy
dame
bewildered
by
the
appearance
and
stately
air
of
the
princess
did
nothing
but
curtsey
and
murmur
incoherent
thanks
but
osra
now
caught
by
the
excitement
of
the
enterprise
clapped
her
hands
crying
quick
quick
or
we
shall
be
too
late
so
christian
lifted
her
down
and
led
away
the
horses
to
a
shed
behind
the
cottage
but
the
old
woman
led
osra
in
and
took
her
to
the
bedroom
where
lay
a
dress
such
as
the
peasant
girls
wore
osra
took
up
the
skirt
and
looked
at
it
curiously
must
i
indeed
wear
this
she
asked
and
i
am
somewhat
tall
mother
the
old
woman
said
that
nothing
would
serve
save
the
dress
and
osra
sighed
yet
as
there
was
no
help
for
it
she
suffered
the
old
woman
to
help
her
in
getting
it
on
so
the
door
was
shut
and
christian
sat
smiling
in
the
sun
outside
well
pleased
at
the
success
of
his
audacious
scheme
and
feeling
crowns
already
in
his
pocket
still
less
did
he
doubt
of
this
most
desirable
result
when
the
door
of
the
cottage
again
opened
and
osra
came
out
blushing
and
yet
biting
her
lips
to
keep
back
her
laughter
her
hair
was
plaited
in
two
long
plaits
she
wore
a
white
bodice
and
over
it
a
jacket
of
black
velvet
and
a
red
skirt
hung
full
from
her
waist
to
but
a
very
little
below
her
knee
then
came
hose
of
red
also
for
it
was
a
holiday
and
the
best
of
all
was
worn
and
stout
shoes
osra
in
her
heart
loved
all
except
the
shoes
yet
she
declared
that
she
loathed
all
except
the
shoes
and
christian
with
eyes
cast
most
demurely
on
the
ground
prayed
her
to
forgive
the
sad
necessity
yet
assured
her
that
lotta
would
die
of
envy
that
very
day
let
us
go
then
said
osra
for
the
sooner
we
go
the
sooner
will
it
be
done
and
i
can
get
rid
of
these
ridiculous
clothes
heaven
have
mercy
on
me
and
grant
that
i
may
meet
none
who
know
me
they
were
mounting
the
hill
now
the
old
woman
standing
at
the
cottage
door
and
watching
when
they
reached
the
top
osra
saw
a
small
village
nestling
in
the
valley
below
and
the
sound
of
music
struck
on
her
ear
at
this
a
sudden
fear
seized
her
and
putting
out
her
hand
she
caught
christian
by
the
sleeve
saying
will
they
know
me
not
they
madame
said
he
but
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
fell
on
a
ring
that
the
princess
wore
a
gem
engraved
with
the
royal
arms
not
they
if
you
conceal
that
ring
and
for
a
moment
he
looked
in
her
face
and
he
smiled
osra
uttered
a
little
cry
as
she
hastily
plucked
the
ring
from
her
finger
and
gave
it
to
him
saying
keep
it
safe
and
do
not
forget
to
give
it
me
again
but
she
would
not
meet
his
glance
for
she
began
from
now
to
suspect
that
he
knew
who
she
was
the
sound
of
music
came
from
a
solid
house
that
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
coming
nearer
they
saw
a
long
table
spread
in
the
shade
near
the
house
and
a
company
of
men
and
women
seated
at
it
the
princess
was
somewhat
comforted
to
find
that
the
girls
dresses
were
in
all
respects
like
her
own
though
hers
seemed
newer
and
more
handsome
therefore
she
took
courage
and
put
her
arm
inside
christian
arm
saying
since
i
have
accepted
the
part
i
will
play
it
come
sir
let
us
go
and
challenge
lotta
your
horse
is
at
stake
he
is
in
no
danger
said
christian
and
i
am
worth
a
thousand
crowns
and
his
eyes
most
plainly
added
the
reason
which
led
him
to
these
comfortable
conclusions
now
at
this
moment
otho
having
toasted
the
company
and
accepted
their
good
wishes
was
standing
up
before
them
all
lotta
standing
by
him
her
hand
in
his
and
he
vowed
as
was
but
right
all
manner
of
love
and
devotion
to
her
and
declared
that
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
world
in
truth
she
was
very
pretty
being
although
low
of
stature
most
admirably
formed
having
golden
hair
the
pinkest
of
cheeks
and
large
blue
eyes
that
followed
a
man
about
in
a
most
appealing
and
distracting
manner
so
that
otho
had
good
reason
to
be
content
and
would
have
come
to
no
harm
had
it
not
been
for
that
old
extravagance
of
lovers
which
will
not
allow
this
world
to
hold
more
than
one
pretty
girl
the
truth
being
of
course
quite
otherwise
but
led
on
by
this
infatuation
otho
cried
i
dare
any
man
to
find
so
pretty
a
girl
as
for
master
christian
whose
wager
you
heard
why
this
evening
his
fine
horse
shall
feed
in
my
stable
softly
friend
otho
softly
came
to
the
ears
of
the
feasters
from
behind
the
trees
mistress
lotta
is
very
pretty
but
i
have
here
a
girl
whom
some
think
handsome
well
this
worthy
company
shall
judge
and
christian
came
from
the
shelter
of
the
trees
leading
osra
by
the
hand
and
he
set
her
opposite
to
lotta
where
all
could
see
her
and
all
looked
and
beheld
her
with
amazement
but
none
spoke
so
they
rested
for
a
long
while
christian
smiling
and
osra
eyes
being
set
on
lotta
while
otho
did
nothing
but
gaze
at
osra
presently
a
low
murmur
began
to
run
along
the
table
who
is
she
asked
some
one
but
none
could
answer
who
is
she
called
an
old
man
to
christian
but
he
answered
what
that
to
you
is
she
not
fairer
and
when
the
others
asked
whence
she
came
he
made
the
same
answer
but
one
young
fellow
leant
from
his
place
and
plucked
christian
sleeve
saying
is
she
promised
to
you
and
at
this
christian
frowned
answering
at
least
she
is
not
for
you
while
osra
overhearing
blushed
mightily
then
otho
still
saying
nothing
suddenly
lugged
out
a
great
purse
of
money
and
flung
it
violently
into
the
middle
of
the
table
with
a
curse
and
christian
with
a
mocking
lift
of
his
hat
came
forward
and
taking
it
tossed
it
up
and
down
in
his
hand
crying
is
it
fair
weight
neighbour
otho
otho
did
not
heed
him
but
turned
suddenly
to
lotta
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
saying
aye
it
is
true
the
devil
must
have
sent
her
but
it
is
true
yet
you
are
pretty
too
my
lass
for
lotta
after
looking
at
all
the
company
and
at
osra
had
been
so
sorely
wounded
in
her
pride
and
robbed
of
her
triumph
that
poor
child
she
had
begun
to
weep
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
and
otho
was
trying
to
comfort
her
though
lover
as
he
was
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
declare
that
she
was
more
beautiful
than
the
girl
whom
christian
had
brought
and
they
all
moved
from
their
places
and
came
to
stand
round
osra
but
she
after
a
moment
caught
from
christian
the
bag
that
he
tossed
so
exultantly
crying
to
him
i
be
your
debtor
for
it
and
bursting
through
the
ring
she
ran
round
the
table
and
came
to
lotta
and
pulling
the
girl
hands
down
from
her
face
she
thrust
the
bag
into
her
hands
and
began
to
talk
to
her
whispering
low
and
looking
into
her
frightened
eyes
with
shining
eyes
ah
my
dear
said
osra
see
he
still
loves
you
dear
ah
why
did
i
come
but
i
am
going
away
yes
now
and
i
shall
never
come
here
again
i
do
harm
wherever
i
go
yes
but
you
be
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
village
always
otho
otho
kiss
her
otho
tell
her
that
you
love
her
otho
do
stand
there
dumb
oh
how
stupid
men
are
do
you
see
what
she
wants
yes
do
it
again
i
never
saw
anybody
so
pretty
otho
yes
yes
dear
keep
the
bag
it
from
me
you
must
keep
it
and
buy
pretty
clothes
and
be
prettier
than
ever
for
otho
sake
because
he
loves
you
by
the
time
the
princess
osra
had
ended
her
consolations
behold
she
was
very
nearly
crying
herself
but
lotta
put
her
arms
round
the
neck
and
kissed
her
because
she
said
that
otho
still
loved
her
and
in
her
gratitude
for
this
she
forgot
thanks
for
the
bag
of
crowns
or
even
to
wonder
who
this
girl
was
that
could
give
away
a
thousand
crowns
but
in
this
the
rest
of
the
company
were
not
like
her
and
an
eager
murmuring
marked
the
excitement
with
which
they
watched
the
scene
and
they
cried
to
christian
look
after
your
crowns
and
thought
him
mad
when
he
shook
his
head
jauntily
answering
let
otho
do
what
he
will
with
them
then
their
interest
growing
more
and
more
intense
they
crowded
round
the
princess
scanning
her
very
closely
and
she
was
in
great
fear
that
she
would
be
known
and
also
in
some
embarrassment
from
the
ardent
glances
and
free
comments
of
the
simple
countrymen
who
were
accustomed
to
say
what
they
thought
with
more
plainness
than
were
the
gentlemen
of
the
court
so
that
at
length
fairly
alarmed
she
gave
lotta
a
last
hasty
kiss
and
made
her
way
to
christian
crying
take
me
away
aye
madame
said
he
and
he
put
her
arm
in
his
and
turned
away
but
all
the
company
followed
him
staring
and
gossiping
and
crowding
so
that
lotta
and
otho
were
left
alone
at
the
feast
which
otho
had
provided
with
nothing
to
console
them
but
one
another
love
and
the
happily
recovered
thousand
crowns
and
the
crowd
pressed
hard
on
osra
and
christian
being
full
of
eagerness
to
see
where
the
girl
went
and
what
became
of
her
thus
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
came
in
sight
of
christian
cottage
but
now
christian
suddenly
loosed
arm
and
turning
round
faced
the
throng
of
inquisitive
folk
with
either
hand
he
drew
a
pistol
from
his
belt
and
when
he
had
cocked
the
pair
he
pointed
them
at
his
friends
and
neighbours
saying
in
a
quiet
and
pleasant
voice
i
shall
count
to
twenty
any
one
who
means
to
be
within
range
when
i
come
to
twenty
had
best
now
order
his
coffin
illustration
with
either
hand
he
drew
a
pistol
at
this
a
great
grumbling
arose
among
them
yet
they
knew
christian
and
did
not
wait
till
he
had
counted
but
one
and
all
turned
tail
and
ran
down
the
hill
much
quicker
than
they
had
come
up
but
one
or
two
fellows
resentful
and
malicious
because
of
their
disappointment
as
soon
as
they
found
themselves
out
of
range
turned
round
and
shouted
aye
he
is
ready
with
his
pistol
is
christian
we
know
him
highwayman
whom
did
you
last
rob
and
christian
went
red
as
the
frock
that
osra
wore
but
she
turned
questioning
eyes
on
him
yes
said
he
sullenly
they
say
highwayman
it
is
true
i
am
a
robber
that
is
why
i
said
madame
that
i
could
not
live
without
my
horse
come
said
osra
let
us
go
to
the
cottage
so
they
returned
together
to
the
cottage
saying
nothing
there
osra
put
on
her
own
clothes
again
and
having
bidden
farewell
to
the
old
woman
who
asked
no
questions
of
her
mounted
her
horse
then
christian
said
shall
i
ride
with
you
madame
she
bowed
her
head
in
assent
till
they
entered
the
forest
the
princess
did
not
speak
but
then
she
sighed
saying
i
am
sorry
that
i
went
with
you
for
if
you
had
lost
your
horse
maybe
you
would
have
ceased
from
your
way
of
life
it
is
better
to
lose
a
horse
than
to
be
hanged
madame
said
he
you
speak
prudently
yet
i
had
rather
be
hanged
than
lose
him
i
am
in
your
debt
a
thousand
crowns
said
she
and
stopping
her
horse
she
wrote
for
him
an
order
for
a
thousand
crowns
and
she
signed
it
with
her
own
name
osra
and
gave
it
to
him
he
received
it
bowing
very
low
you
knew
me
all
the
time
she
asked
yes
madame
said
he
they
had
now
come
to
where
he
had
first
met
her
why
do
you
live
by
robbery
she
asked
for
the
love
of
the
same
thing
that
made
you
come
with
me
madame
but
could
you
not
find
what
you
love
in
the
king
service
i
do
not
like
service
madame
said
christian
i
love
to
be
free
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
a
lower
tone
could
you
not
endure
my
service
sir
in
that
i
shall
now
live
and
die
madame
said
he
and
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
again
in
silence
they
rode
on
it
was
evening
now
and
had
grown
dark
and
presently
the
lantern
in
the
tower
of
the
keep
of
zenda
became
visible
then
osra
drew
rein
for
my
sake
said
she
rob
no
more
what
you
command
madame
is
my
law
and
here
is
your
ring
keep
the
ring
she
said
but
when
i
can
serve
you
you
shall
send
it
back
to
me
and
ask
what
you
will
in
return
for
it
there
is
nothing
said
he
very
low
and
looking
away
from
her
that
i
would
take
in
exchange
for
it
a
foolish
man
or
only
a
foolish
speech
she
asked
as
lightly
as
she
could
with
one
fleeting
glance
at
his
face
a
foolish
man
madame
it
may
be
but
a
true
speech
and
he
bent
bareheaded
in
his
saddle
and
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
still
bareheaded
he
turned
away
and
rode
back
at
a
canter
into
the
forest
but
the
princess
osra
rode
on
to
the
castle
wondering
greatly
at
what
she
had
done
that
day
yet
she
could
not
be
very
sorry
that
she
had
saved
his
horse
for
him
and
she
trusted
that
otho
and
lotta
would
be
happy
and
she
thought
that
one
man
was
after
all
as
good
flesh
and
blood
as
another
and
then
that
she
was
a
princess
and
he
a
robber
and
that
his
eyes
had
been
over
bold
yet
there
was
deference
in
them
also
it
is
a
great
pity
that
he
should
be
a
robber
sighed
the
princess
as
she
reached
the
castle
the
princess
osra
carriage
was
within
two
miles
of
strelsau
when
she
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
asked
the
officer
who
rode
by
the
wheel
why
such
a
throng
of
people
hastened
to
the
city
illustration
she
asked
the
officer
why
a
throng
of
people
hastened
to
the
city
it
is
nothing
madame
answered
he
saluting
it
is
only
that
two
rogues
are
to
be
hanged
what
pleasure
is
there
in
seeing
men
hanged
asked
osra
scornfully
i
wish
i
had
not
come
and
she
drew
her
head
back
in
disgust
then
she
called
go
slowly
and
do
not
let
me
get
into
the
middle
of
the
wild
beasts
who
go
to
gloat
over
men
being
hanged
so
the
horses
were
checked
to
a
walk
and
thus
the
carriage
proceeded
slowly
towards
strelsau
but
presently
the
princess
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
again
and
asked
who
are
to
be
hanged
sir
the
noted
highwayman
sigismund
kohl
madame
said
the
officer
he
robbed
the
archbishop
coach
in
the
forest
of
zenda
but
they
pursued
him
over
the
frontier
and
tracked
him
to
the
cottage
of
the
other
rogue
who
had
a
part
in
many
previous
robberies
though
not
in
this
the
second
fellow
hid
kohl
and
tried
to
put
off
the
officers
but
they
caught
them
both
and
both
are
to
be
hanged
it
seems
hard
said
osra
to
hang
the
one
who
only
sheltered
his
friend
he
could
do
no
less
nay
madame
he
richly
deserves
it
besides
his
previous
robberies
he
is
gravely
suspected
of
a
most
foul
murder
for
a
few
weeks
ago
he
was
in
company
with
a
girl
and
she
seemed
to
have
money
and
to
spare
and
was
mighty
pretty
too
they
say
now
he
can
give
no
account
of
what
has
become
of
her
but
they
have
found
all
the
clothes
she
wore
hidden
away
in
his
house
and
he
says
his
mother
bought
the
clothes
but
they
are
a
girl
clothes
not
an
old
woman
it
looks
black
but
luckily
the
other
matter
is
enough
to
hang
him
on
his
mother
clothes
in
faith
would
an
old
woman
who
died
three
weeks
ago
have
bought
a
new
red
frock
and
smart
red
stockings
for
herself
a
red
frock
red
stockings
and
the
mother
is
dead
dead
of
what
of
a
chill
madame
such
as
carries
old
people
off
suddenly
yes
it
looks
black
and
so
the
people
think
for
when
the
pair
were
brought
into
the
city
though
the
rascals
cheered
kohl
who
had
only
robbed
the
archbishop
they
pelted
and
came
near
to
killing
christian
hantz
the
princess
face
went
pale
and
she
sank
back
murmuring
christian
hantz
but
in
another
moment
she
cried
at
what
hour
is
the
hanging
at
noon
madame
that
is
half
an
hour
from
now
then
the
princess
cried
in
a
loud
urgent
tone
faster
faster
drive
at
top
speed
the
officers
looked
at
her
in
wonder
but
she
cried
a
hundred
crowns
to
the
coachman
if
he
brings
me
to
the
place
before
noon
quick
quick
for
she
was
all
on
fire
at
the
thought
that
christian
hantz
was
to
be
hanged
not
for
any
new
robbery
but
because
he
had
sheltered
his
friend
and
she
knew
how
the
red
skirt
and
the
red
stockings
came
in
his
house
her
breath
caught
in
her
throat
as
she
thought
how
he
had
suffered
stoning
and
execration
rather
than
betray
her
secret
and
she
cried
out
to
herself
as
she
was
carried
along
but
the
ring
why
did
he
not
send
the
ring
by
now
they
were
at
the
gates
of
the
city
and
now
within
them
the
officer
and
the
two
men
who
were
with
him
rode
forward
to
clear
the
road
for
the
princess
thus
they
made
their
way
on
until
they
came
to
the
street
which
leads
from
the
west
gate
to
the
cathedral
and
could
see
the
gibbet
that
had
been
raised
before
the
prison
between
the
cathedral
and
the
palace
but
here
the
whole
street
was
blocked
with
people
and
the
officer
could
not
get
the
carriage
through
for
the
folk
were
thick
as
swarming
bees
all
across
the
roadway
and
even
if
they
would
have
moved
they
could
not
so
the
carriage
came
to
a
dead
stand
while
the
officer
said
to
princess
osra
madame
it
is
useless
we
can
not
get
through
them
osra
sprang
from
the
carriage
and
she
said
you
have
two
men
with
you
sir
for
god
sake
gentlemen
bring
me
through
to
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
i
care
not
if
it
costs
me
my
life
nor
we
madame
though
it
costs
us
ours
since
it
is
your
pleasure
they
said
as
every
man
in
the
city
would
have
said
for
the
princess
osra
and
the
two
men
went
ahead
while
osra
followed
with
the
officer
and
pushing
and
struggling
and
dodging
in
and
out
aye
and
when
need
was
hitting
and
buffeting
and
kicking
the
three
took
her
through
into
the
square
of
the
cathedral
and
the
clock
in
the
great
tower
struck
noon
as
the
bell
boomed
a
cry
went
up
from
the
thronged
square
the
body
of
a
man
shot
from
the
scaffold
to
the
top
of
the
gibbet
and
hung
there
the
people
cried
aloud
some
cheering
some
also
groaning
and
weeping
who
is
it
who
is
it
asked
the
princess
it
is
sigismund
kohl
madame
said
the
officer
then
on
on
on
she
commanded
and
again
they
struggled
forward
now
a
louder
and
fiercer
cry
rang
out
as
a
man
was
brought
forward
on
the
scaffold
in
his
shirt
and
breeches
a
priest
was
with
him
holding
a
crucifix
before
his
eyes
king
rudolf
who
sat
at
a
window
of
his
palace
asked
why
they
delayed
to
string
the
rascal
up
and
one
of
his
gentlemen
answered
sire
the
priest
begged
a
few
minutes
delay
for
the
obstinate
rogue
will
not
confess
to
the
murder
of
the
girl
and
therefore
can
not
receive
absolution
and
the
priest
is
loth
to
have
him
hanged
without
it
he
shall
be
hanged
without
it
unless
his
conscience
act
quickly
said
the
king
but
a
moment
later
he
asked
what
is
the
tumult
in
the
corner
of
the
square
there
is
a
fight
there
let
it
be
seen
to
indeed
there
was
a
fight
for
the
three
with
osra
were
bent
on
getting
through
and
the
crowd
would
not
let
them
through
and
they
struck
at
the
crowd
and
the
crowd
at
them
but
suddenly
some
one
peering
past
the
guards
exclaimed
the
princess
osra
the
princess
then
the
blows
ceased
and
the
crowd
began
slowly
to
give
back
making
way
for
osra
and
she
walked
between
walls
of
people
yet
did
not
seem
to
see
or
to
take
heed
of
any
of
them
her
eyes
were
glued
to
the
man
on
the
scaffold
for
even
now
the
priest
who
had
held
the
crucifix
turned
sorrowfully
away
and
signed
with
his
hand
to
the
hangman
again
the
people
shouted
fiercely
for
christian
death
and
he
stepping
forward
gave
himself
into
the
executioner
hands
those
who
were
near
him
saw
that
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
as
the
hangman
took
hold
of
him
he
kissed
a
little
packet
which
he
held
in
his
right
hand
but
the
people
shrieked
loudly
murderer
murderer
where
is
the
girl
at
this
stung
beyond
endurance
christian
cried
so
loudly
that
his
voice
rose
above
the
clamour
i
am
no
murderer
i
did
not
touch
a
hair
of
her
head
then
where
is
she
where
is
she
they
shouted
i
do
not
know
said
he
and
he
added
in
a
low
tone
kissing
his
little
packet
again
wherever
she
is
god
in
his
graciousness
send
her
joy
and
he
turned
to
the
executioner
saying
get
on
man
but
then
he
looked
as
it
were
for
the
last
time
on
the
living
sea
of
faces
round
him
and
suddenly
out
of
all
of
them
he
saw
one
what
christian
saw
the
king
saw
also
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
with
an
oath
and
a
laugh
this
sister
of
mine
is
a
wonderful
wench
said
he
come
let
us
see
why
she
will
not
have
this
rascal
hanged
run
some
one
and
tell
them
not
to
string
him
up
till
i
give
the
word
the
king
walked
out
of
the
palace
and
came
into
the
square
the
guard
parting
the
people
before
him
and
osra
seeing
him
coming
stood
now
quite
still
blushing
and
smiling
although
she
was
very
ashamed
and
panted
sorely
then
the
king
came
and
faced
her
saying
nothing
but
lifting
his
eyebrows
and
smiling
whimsically
but
at
last
he
whispered
what
was
there
a
man
in
the
forest
osra
and
she
answered
do
not
ask
me
that
sire
but
ask
christian
hantz
what
is
in
the
packet
which
he
kissed
as
the
hangman
took
hold
of
him
he
is
not
only
a
robber
but
a
murderer
also
though
he
will
not
own
to
it
no
he
is
no
murderer
said
she
look
in
the
packet
then
come
and
look
with
me
said
the
king
and
taking
her
hand
he
led
her
up
on
to
the
scaffold
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
who
wondered
and
laughed
for
they
always
laughed
at
the
ways
of
the
princess
osra
but
she
flew
straight
across
to
christian
who
fell
on
one
knee
with
the
rope
round
his
neck
give
me
the
packet
she
cried
and
she
tore
it
open
and
in
it
she
found
her
order
for
a
thousand
crowns
and
the
gem
engraved
with
the
royal
arms
for
an
instant
she
looked
at
christian
and
then
she
said
you
have
not
got
money
for
the
order
yet
my
name
is
good
for
a
thousand
crowns
to
me
madame
it
was
better
than
fifty
thousand
but
she
broke
out
eagerly
you
should
have
sent
the
ring
i
could
have
saved
you
but
you
would
have
kept
it
in
return
for
the
service
madame
aye
sir
that
was
the
bargain
said
osra
with
a
little
low
laugh
i
knew
it
and
i
preferred
to
die
with
it
rather
than
live
without
it
another
foolish
speech
yes
for
the
man
is
foolish
madame
and
they
cry
to
you
is
the
girl
and
you
do
not
answer
but
die
under
a
foul
charge
to
this
christian
hantz
made
no
answer
at
all
unless
it
were
one
to
murmur
mournfully
and
madame
they
have
taken
from
me
the
red
skirt
and
the
princess
osra
suddenly
turned
from
him
and
went
to
the
king
who
had
stood
regarding
her
and
she
knelt
down
before
him
saying
sire
and
dear
brother
pardon
this
man
he
did
but
shelter
his
friend
and
he
will
rob
no
more
i
might
forgive
him
his
robberies
if
he
would
take
service
in
my
army
yes
in
my
regiment
of
guards
she
cried
but
how
shall
i
forgive
that
foul
murder
of
which
he
is
certainly
guilty
for
where
sister
is
the
pretty
girl
of
whom
no
traces
can
be
found
saving
her
dress
her
red
skirt
and
sire
these
things
i
pray
you
sire
let
your
gentlemen
stand
back
a
little
stand
back
then
gentlemen
said
the
king
these
things
sire
were
by
a
strange
chance
in
the
little
parcel
that
the
poor
man
kissed
though
why
he
kissed
it
i
do
not
know
the
king
took
osra
order
for
a
thousand
crowns
and
also
the
gem
engraved
with
the
royal
arms
he
looked
at
them
and
at
his
sister
therefore
sire
said
she
i
ask
life
and
pardon
for
the
most
courteous
gentleman
in
your
dominions
for
he
prized
my
ring
above
his
life
and
my
secret
above
his
honour
sire
such
men
should
live
and
not
die
the
king
turned
to
his
officers
and
said
gentlemen
the
princess
knows
that
the
girl
is
alive
and
well
and
has
no
complaint
against
this
man
for
he
might
not
in
honour
tell
who
or
where
she
was
and
for
the
rest
he
did
but
shelter
his
friend
and
my
sister
is
surety
that
he
will
rob
no
more
may
he
live
when
they
heard
this
they
all
declared
that
christian
should
live
and
they
went
into
the
crowd
and
told
the
people
that
the
girl
was
found
then
the
people
suddenly
veered
round
and
began
to
cheer
christian
and
some
cried
who
is
the
girl
and
laughed
merrily
conceiving
that
it
was
a
love
affair
on
which
christian
had
been
engaged
and
because
he
preferred
to
die
under
an
imputation
of
murder
rather
than
endanger
his
love
reputation
he
became
a
hero
with
them
and
when
they
heard
he
was
not
to
die
they
dispersed
in
the
utmost
good
temper
cheering
him
and
the
king
and
above
all
the
princess
osra
whom
they
loved
but
she
went
again
to
christian
and
bade
the
hangman
take
the
rope
off
his
neck
will
you
serve
in
my
regiment
of
guards
sir
she
asked
or
is
service
still
irksome
to
you
i
will
serve
you
madame
said
christian
and
since
you
will
need
equipment
get
money
for
this
order
and
she
gave
him
again
the
order
i
must
needs
obey
you
madame
though
reluctantly
it
is
well
sir
i
trust
you
will
serve
me
faithfully
i
bid
you
farewell
sir
and
she
bowed
slightly
and
turned
as
if
to
leave
him
and
he
said
nothing
but
stood
looking
at
her
so
that
presently
she
blushed
saying
they
will
let
you
have
those
things
now
sir
christian
bowed
very
low
and
raising
himself
again
looked
at
her
ring
nay
i
can
not
do
that
said
princess
osra
but
you
will
see
it
now
and
then
and
now
and
then
maybe
you
can
touch
it
and
she
put
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
knelt
and
kissed
the
ring
and
then
her
hand
but
he
looked
very
glum
and
the
princess
laughed
openly
at
him
her
eyes
dancing
in
delight
and
amusement
but
he
still
looked
more
as
though
he
were
going
to
be
hanged
than
he
had
any
time
before
in
the
day
so
that
the
king
pointing
at
him
said
to
osra
an
ungrateful
dog
upon
my
soul
he
looks
as
though
he
were
sorry
not
to
be
hanged
do
you
call
that
courtesy
but
the
princess
laughed
softly
and
rubbed
the
ring
on
her
finger
as
she
answered
aye
sire
i
call
that
the
best
of
courtesy
chapter
the
sin
of
the
bishop
of
modenstein
in
the
days
of
rudolf
iii
there
stood
on
the
hill
opposite
the
castle
of
zenda
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
in
which
the
town
lies
on
the
site
where
the
of
tarlenheim
now
is
situated
a
fine
and
strong
castle
belonging
to
count
nikolas
of
festenburg
he
was
a
noble
of
very
old
and
high
family
and
had
great
estates
his
house
being
indeed
second
only
to
the
royal
house
in
rank
and
reputation
he
himself
was
a
young
man
of
great
accomplishments
of
a
domineering
temper
and
of
much
ambition
and
he
had
gained
distinction
in
the
wars
that
marked
the
closing
years
of
the
reign
of
king
henry
the
lion
with
king
rudolf
he
was
not
on
terms
of
cordial
friendship
for
he
despised
the
king
easy
manners
and
carelessness
of
dignity
while
the
king
had
no
love
for
a
gentleman
whose
one
object
seemed
to
be
to
surpass
and
outshine
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
people
and
who
never
rested
from
extending
and
fortifying
his
castle
until
it
threatened
to
surpass
zenda
itself
both
in
strength
and
magnificence
moreover
nikolas
although
maintaining
a
state
ample
and
suitable
to
his
rank
was
yet
careful
and
prudent
while
rudolf
spent
all
that
he
received
and
more
besides
so
that
the
count
grew
richer
and
the
king
poorer
but
in
spite
of
these
causes
of
difference
the
count
was
received
at
court
with
apparent
graciousness
and
no
open
outburst
of
enmity
had
yet
occurred
the
pair
being
on
the
contrary
often
together
and
sharing
their
sports
and
pastimes
with
one
another
now
most
of
these
diversions
were
harmless
or
indeed
becoming
and
proper
but
there
was
one
among
them
full
of
danger
to
a
man
of
hot
head
and
ungoverned
impulse
such
as
king
rudolf
was
and
this
one
was
diceing
in
which
the
king
took
great
delight
and
in
which
the
count
nikolas
was
very
ready
to
encourage
him
the
king
who
was
generous
and
hated
to
win
from
poor
men
or
those
who
might
be
playing
beyond
their
means
in
order
to
give
him
pleasure
was
delighted
to
find
an
opponent
whose
purse
was
as
long
or
longer
than
his
own
and
thus
gradually
came
to
pass
many
evenings
with
the
boxes
in
nikolas
company
and
the
more
evenings
he
passed
the
deeper
he
fell
into
the
count
debt
for
the
king
drank
wine
while
the
count
was
content
with
small
beer
and
when
the
king
was
losing
he
doubled
his
stakes
whereas
the
count
took
in
sail
if
the
wind
seemed
adverse
thus
always
and
steadily
the
debt
grew
till
at
last
rudolf
dared
not
reckon
how
large
it
had
become
nor
did
he
dare
to
disclose
it
to
his
advisers
for
there
were
great
public
burdens
already
imposed
by
reason
of
king
henry
wars
and
the
citizens
of
strelsau
were
not
in
a
mood
to
bear
fresh
exaction
nor
to
give
their
hard
earnings
for
the
payment
of
the
king
gambling
debts
in
fine
although
they
loved
the
elphbergs
well
enough
they
loved
their
money
more
thus
the
king
had
no
resource
except
in
his
private
possessions
and
these
were
of
no
great
value
saving
the
castle
and
estate
of
zenda
at
length
when
they
had
sat
late
one
night
and
the
throws
had
gone
all
the
evening
against
the
king
and
for
nikolas
the
king
flung
himself
back
in
his
chair
drained
his
glass
and
said
impatiently
i
am
weary
of
the
game
come
my
lord
let
us
end
it
i
would
not
urge
you
sire
a
moment
beyond
what
you
desire
i
play
but
for
your
pleasure
then
my
pleasure
has
been
your
profit
said
the
king
with
a
vexed
laugh
for
i
believe
i
am
stripped
of
my
last
crown
what
is
my
debt
the
count
who
had
the
whole
sum
reckoned
on
his
tablets
took
them
out
and
shewed
the
king
the
amount
of
the
debt
i
can
not
pay
it
said
rudolf
i
would
play
you
again
to
double
the
debt
or
wipe
it
out
but
i
have
nothing
of
value
enough
to
stake
the
desire
which
had
been
nursed
for
long
in
the
count
heart
now
saw
the
moment
of
its
possible
realisation
he
leant
over
the
table
and
smoothing
his
beard
with
his
hand
said
gently
the
amount
is
no
more
than
half
the
value
of
your
majesty
castle
and
demesne
of
zenda
the
king
started
and
forced
a
laugh
aye
zenda
spoils
the
prospect
from
festenburg
does
it
said
he
but
i
will
not
risk
zenda
an
elphberg
without
zenda
would
seem
like
a
man
robbed
of
his
wife
we
have
had
it
since
we
have
had
anything
or
been
anything
i
should
not
seem
king
without
it
as
you
will
sire
then
the
debt
stands
he
looked
full
and
keenly
into
the
king
eyes
asking
without
words
how
will
you
pay
it
and
adding
without
words
paid
it
must
be
and
the
king
read
the
unspoken
words
in
the
eyes
of
count
nikolas
the
king
took
up
his
glass
but
finding
it
empty
flung
it
angrily
on
the
floor
where
it
shivered
into
fragments
at
count
nikolas
feet
and
he
shifted
in
his
chair
and
cursed
softly
under
his
breath
nikolas
sat
with
the
in
his
hand
and
a
smile
on
his
lips
for
he
knew
that
the
king
could
not
pay
and
therefore
must
play
and
he
was
in
the
vein
and
did
not
doubt
of
winning
from
the
king
zenda
and
its
demesne
then
he
would
be
the
greatest
lord
in
the
kingdom
and
hold
for
his
own
a
kingdom
within
the
kingdom
and
the
two
strongest
places
in
all
the
land
and
a
greater
prize
might
then
dangle
in
reach
of
his
grasp
the
devil
spurs
and
i
gallop
said
the
king
at
last
and
he
took
up
the
and
rattled
it
fortune
will
smile
on
you
this
time
sire
and
i
shall
not
grieve
at
it
said
count
nikolas
with
a
courteous
smile
curses
on
her
cried
the
king
come
my
lord
a
quick
ending
to
it
one
throw
and
i
am
a
free
man
or
you
are
master
of
my
castle
one
throw
let
it
be
sire
for
it
grows
late
assented
nikolas
with
a
careless
air
and
they
both
raised
the
boxes
and
rattled
the
dice
inside
them
the
king
threw
his
throw
was
a
six
and
a
five
and
a
sudden
gleam
of
hope
lit
up
his
eyes
he
leant
forward
in
his
chair
gripping
the
elbows
of
it
with
his
hands
his
cheeks
flushed
and
his
breath
came
quickly
with
a
bow
count
nikolas
raised
his
hand
and
threw
the
dice
fell
and
rolled
on
the
table
the
king
sank
back
and
the
count
said
with
a
smile
of
apology
and
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
indeed
i
am
ashamed
for
i
can
not
be
denied
for
count
nikolas
of
festenburg
had
thrown
sixes
and
thereby
won
from
the
king
the
castle
and
demesne
of
zenda
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
having
buckled
on
his
sword
that
had
lain
on
the
table
by
him
and
taking
his
hat
in
his
hand
stood
looking
down
on
the
king
with
a
malicious
smile
on
his
face
and
he
said
with
a
look
that
had
more
mockery
than
respect
in
it
have
i
your
majesty
leave
to
withdraw
for
ere
day
dawn
i
have
matters
to
transact
in
strelsau
and
i
would
be
at
my
castle
of
zenda
then
king
rudolf
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
an
order
that
the
castle
and
all
that
was
in
it
and
all
the
demesne
should
be
surrendered
to
count
nikolas
of
festenburg
on
his
demand
and
he
gave
the
paper
to
nikolas
then
he
rose
up
and
held
out
his
hand
which
nikolas
kissed
smiling
covertly
and
the
king
said
with
grace
and
dignity
cousin
my
castle
has
found
a
more
worthy
master
god
give
you
joy
of
it
and
he
motioned
with
his
hand
to
be
left
alone
then
when
the
count
had
gone
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
again
and
remained
there
till
it
was
full
day
neither
moving
nor
yet
sleeping
there
he
was
found
by
his
gentlemen
when
they
came
to
dress
him
but
none
asked
him
what
had
passed
count
nikolas
now
lord
of
zenda
did
not
so
waste
time
and
the
matters
that
he
had
spoken
of
did
not
keep
him
long
in
strelsau
but
in
the
early
morning
he
rode
out
the
paper
which
the
king
had
written
in
his
belt
first
he
rode
with
all
speed
to
his
own
house
of
festenburg
and
there
he
gathered
together
all
his
followers
servants
foresters
and
armed
retainers
and
he
told
them
that
they
were
to
ride
with
him
to
zenda
for
that
zenda
was
now
his
and
not
the
king
at
this
they
were
greatly
astonished
but
they
ate
the
fine
dinner
and
drank
the
wine
which
he
provided
and
in
the
evening
they
rode
down
the
hill
very
merry
and
trotted
nearly
a
hundred
strong
through
the
town
making
a
great
noise
so
that
they
disturbed
the
bishop
of
modenstein
who
was
lying
that
night
at
the
inn
in
the
course
of
a
journey
from
his
see
to
the
capital
but
nobody
could
tell
the
bishop
why
they
rode
to
zenda
and
presently
the
bishop
being
wearied
with
travelling
went
to
his
bed
now
king
rudolf
in
his
chagrin
and
dismay
had
himself
forgotten
or
had
at
least
neglected
to
warn
the
count
of
festenburg
that
his
sister
princess
osra
was
residing
at
the
castle
of
zenda
for
it
was
her
favourite
resort
and
she
often
retired
from
the
court
and
spent
many
days
there
alone
there
she
was
now
with
two
of
her
ladies
a
small
retinue
of
servants
and
no
more
than
half
a
dozen
guards
and
when
count
nikolas
came
to
the
gate
it
being
then
after
nine
she
had
gone
to
her
own
chamber
and
sat
before
the
mirror
dressed
in
a
loose
white
gown
with
her
ruddy
hair
unbound
and
floating
over
her
shoulders
she
was
reading
an
old
story
book
containing
tales
of
helen
of
troy
of
cleopatra
of
berenice
and
other
lovely
ladies
very
elegantly
related
and
embellished
with
fine
pictures
and
the
princess
being
very
much
absorbed
in
the
stories
did
not
hear
nor
notice
the
arrival
of
the
count
company
but
continued
to
read
while
nikolas
roused
the
watchmen
and
the
bridge
was
let
down
and
the
steward
summoned
then
nikolas
took
the
steward
aside
and
shewed
him
the
king
order
bearing
the
king
seal
and
the
steward
although
both
greatly
astonished
and
greatly
grieved
could
not
deny
the
letter
or
the
seal
but
declared
himself
ready
to
obey
and
to
surrender
the
castle
and
the
sergeant
in
command
of
the
guard
said
the
same
but
they
added
since
the
princess
was
in
the
castle
they
must
inform
her
of
the
matter
and
take
her
commands
aye
do
said
nikolas
sitting
down
in
the
great
hall
tell
her
not
to
be
disturbed
but
to
give
me
the
honour
of
being
her
host
for
as
long
as
she
will
and
say
that
i
will
wait
on
her
if
it
be
her
pleasure
but
he
smiled
to
think
of
the
anger
and
scorn
with
which
osra
would
receive
the
tidings
when
the
steward
delivered
them
to
her
in
this
respect
the
event
did
not
fall
short
of
his
expectations
for
she
was
so
indignant
and
aghast
that
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
tidings
she
flung
away
the
book
and
cried
send
the
count
here
to
me
and
stood
waiting
for
him
there
in
her
chamber
in
her
white
gown
and
with
her
hair
unbound
and
flowing
down
over
her
shoulders
and
when
he
came
she
cried
what
is
this
my
lord
and
listened
to
his
story
with
parted
lips
and
flashing
eyes
and
thus
read
the
king
letter
and
saw
the
king
seal
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
she
dashed
them
away
with
her
hand
then
the
count
said
bowing
to
her
as
mockingly
as
he
had
bowed
to
her
brother
it
is
the
fortune
of
the
dice
madame
yes
my
lord
as
you
play
the
game
said
she
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
more
beautiful
in
her
white
gown
and
with
her
hair
unbound
over
her
shoulders
than
he
had
ever
felt
her
to
be
before
and
he
eyed
her
closely
suddenly
she
looked
at
him
and
for
a
moment
he
averted
his
eyes
but
he
looked
again
and
her
eyes
met
his
for
several
moments
she
stood
rigid
and
motionless
then
she
said
my
lord
the
king
has
lost
the
castle
of
zenda
which
is
the
home
and
cradle
of
our
house
it
was
scarcely
the
king
alone
to
lose
have
i
no
title
in
it
it
was
the
king
madame
and
now
it
is
mine
smiled
nikolas
well
then
it
is
yours
said
she
and
taking
a
step
towards
him
she
said
have
you
a
mind
to
venture
it
again
my
lord
i
would
venture
it
only
against
a
great
stake
said
he
smiling
still
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
face
and
marked
every
change
in
the
colour
of
her
cheeks
i
can
play
dice
as
well
as
the
king
she
cried
are
we
not
all
gamblers
we
elphbergs
and
she
laughed
bitterly
but
what
would
your
stake
be
he
asked
sneeringly
princess
osra
face
was
now
very
pale
but
her
voice
did
not
tremble
and
she
did
not
flinch
for
the
honour
of
her
house
and
of
the
throne
was
as
sacred
to
her
as
her
salvation
and
more
than
her
happiness
a
stake
my
lord
said
she
that
many
gentlemen
have
thought
above
any
castle
in
preciousness
of
what
do
you
speak
he
asked
and
his
voice
quivered
a
little
as
a
man
does
in
excitement
for
pardon
me
madame
but
what
have
you
of
such
value
i
have
what
the
poorest
girl
has
and
it
is
of
the
value
that
it
pleased
god
to
make
it
and
pleases
men
to
think
it
said
osra
and
all
of
it
i
will
stake
against
the
king
castle
of
zenda
and
its
demesne
count
nikolas
eyes
flashed
and
he
drew
nearer
to
her
he
took
his
from
his
pocket
and
he
held
it
up
before
her
and
he
whispered
in
an
eager
hoarse
voice
name
this
great
stake
madame
what
is
it
it
is
myself
my
lord
said
princess
osra
yourself
he
cried
wondering
though
he
had
half
guessed
aye
to
be
the
lord
of
zenda
is
much
is
it
not
more
to
be
husband
to
the
king
sister
it
is
more
said
he
when
the
king
sister
is
the
princess
osra
and
he
looked
at
her
now
with
open
admiration
but
she
did
not
heed
his
glance
but
with
face
pale
as
death
she
seized
a
small
table
and
drew
it
between
them
and
cried
throw
then
my
lord
we
know
the
stakes
if
you
win
zenda
is
yours
if
i
win
you
are
mine
yes
i
and
zenda
also
said
she
throw
my
lord
shall
we
throw
thrice
madame
or
once
or
how
often
thrice
my
lord
she
answered
tossing
back
her
hair
behind
her
neck
and
holding
one
hand
to
her
side
throw
first
she
added
the
count
rattled
the
box
and
the
throw
was
seven
osra
took
the
box
from
him
looked
keenly
and
defiantly
in
his
eyes
and
threw
fortune
is
with
you
madame
said
he
biting
his
lips
for
a
five
and
a
four
make
nine
or
i
err
greatly
he
took
the
box
from
her
his
hand
shook
but
hers
was
firm
and
steady
and
again
he
threw
ah
it
is
but
five
said
he
impatiently
and
a
frown
settled
on
his
brow
it
is
enough
my
lord
said
osra
and
pointed
to
the
dice
that
she
had
thrown
a
three
and
a
one
the
count
eyes
gleamed
again
he
sprang
towards
her
and
was
about
to
seize
the
box
but
he
checked
himself
suddenly
and
bowed
saying
throw
first
this
time
i
pray
you
madame
if
it
be
not
disagreeable
to
you
i
do
not
care
which
way
it
is
said
osra
and
she
shook
and
made
her
third
cast
when
she
lifted
the
box
the
face
of
the
dice
showed
seven
a
smile
broadened
on
the
count
lips
for
he
thought
surely
he
could
beat
seven
he
that
had
beaten
eleven
and
thereby
won
the
castle
of
zenda
which
now
he
staked
against
the
princess
osra
but
his
eyes
were
very
keenly
and
attentively
on
her
and
he
held
the
box
poised
in
his
right
hand
then
a
sudden
faintness
and
sickness
seized
on
the
princess
and
the
composure
that
had
hitherto
upheld
her
failed
she
could
not
meet
his
glance
nor
could
she
bear
to
see
the
fall
of
the
dice
but
she
turned
away
her
head
before
he
threw
and
stood
thus
with
averted
face
but
he
kept
attentive
eyes
on
her
and
drew
very
near
to
the
table
so
that
he
stood
right
over
it
and
the
princess
osra
caught
sight
of
her
own
face
in
the
mirror
and
started
to
see
herself
pallid
and
ghastly
and
her
features
drawn
as
though
she
were
suffering
some
great
pain
yet
she
uttered
no
sound
the
dice
rattled
in
the
box
they
rattled
on
the
table
there
was
a
pause
while
a
man
might
quickly
count
a
dozen
and
then
count
nikolas
of
festenburg
cried
out
in
a
voice
that
trembled
and
tripped
over
the
words
eight
eight
eight
but
before
the
last
of
the
words
had
left
his
shaking
lips
the
princess
osra
faced
round
on
him
like
lightning
she
raised
her
hand
so
that
the
loose
white
sleeve
fell
back
from
her
rounded
arm
and
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
lips
curled
as
she
outstretched
her
arm
at
him
and
cried
foul
play
for
as
she
watched
her
own
pale
face
in
the
mirror
the
mirror
which
count
nikolas
had
not
heeded
she
had
seen
him
throw
she
had
seen
him
stand
for
an
instant
over
the
dice
he
had
thrown
with
gloomy
and
maddened
face
and
then
she
had
seen
a
slight
swift
movement
of
his
left
hand
as
his
fingers
deftly
darted
down
and
touched
one
of
the
dice
and
turned
it
and
all
this
she
had
seen
before
he
had
cried
eight
therefore
now
she
turned
on
him
and
cried
foul
play
and
before
he
could
speak
she
darted
by
him
towards
the
door
but
he
sprang
forward
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
above
the
wrist
and
gripped
her
and
his
fingers
bit
into
the
flesh
of
her
arm
as
he
gasped
you
lie
where
are
you
going
but
her
voice
rang
out
clear
and
loud
in
answer
i
am
going
to
tell
all
the
world
that
zenda
is
ours
again
and
i
am
going
to
publish
in
every
city
in
the
kingdom
that
count
nikolas
of
festenburg
is
a
common
cheat
and
rogue
and
should
be
whipped
at
the
cart
tail
through
the
streets
of
strelsau
for
i
saw
you
in
the
mirror
my
lord
i
saw
you
in
the
mirror
and
she
ended
with
a
wild
laugh
that
echoed
through
the
room
still
he
gripped
her
arm
and
she
did
not
flinch
for
an
instant
he
looked
full
in
her
eyes
covetousness
and
desire
and
shame
came
all
together
upon
him
and
him
and
he
hissed
between
set
teeth
you
sha
by
god
you
sha
aye
but
i
will
my
lord
said
osra
it
is
a
fine
tale
for
the
king
and
for
your
friends
in
strelsau
an
instant
longer
he
held
her
where
she
was
and
he
gasped
and
licked
his
lips
then
he
suddenly
dragged
her
with
him
towards
a
couch
seizing
up
a
coverlet
that
lay
on
the
couch
he
flung
it
around
her
and
he
folded
it
tight
about
her
and
he
drew
it
close
over
her
face
she
could
not
cry
out
nor
move
he
lifted
her
up
and
swung
her
over
his
shoulder
and
opening
the
door
of
the
room
dashed
down
the
stairs
towards
the
great
hall
in
the
great
hall
were
six
of
the
king
guard
and
some
of
the
servants
of
the
castle
and
many
of
the
people
who
had
come
with
count
nikolas
they
all
sprang
to
their
feet
when
they
saw
them
he
took
no
heed
of
them
but
rushed
at
a
run
through
the
hall
and
out
under
the
portcullis
and
across
the
bridge
which
had
not
been
raised
since
he
entered
there
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
a
lackey
held
his
horse
and
he
leapt
on
his
horse
setting
one
hand
on
the
saddle
and
still
holding
osra
and
then
he
cried
aloud
my
men
follow
me
to
festenburg
and
all
his
men
ran
out
the
king
guard
doing
nothing
to
hinder
them
and
jumping
on
their
horses
and
setting
them
at
a
gallop
hurried
after
the
count
he
riding
furiously
turned
towards
the
town
of
zenda
and
the
whole
company
swept
down
the
hill
and
reaching
the
town
clattered
and
dashed
through
it
at
full
gallop
neither
drawing
rein
nor
turning
to
right
or
left
and
again
they
roused
the
bishop
of
modenstein
and
he
turned
in
his
bed
wondering
what
the
rush
of
mounted
men
meant
but
they
galloping
still
climbed
the
opposite
hill
and
came
to
the
castle
of
festenburg
with
their
horses
spent
and
foundered
in
they
all
crowded
close
on
one
another
heels
the
bridge
was
drawn
up
and
there
in
the
entrance
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
asking
mutely
what
their
master
had
done
and
who
was
the
lady
whom
he
carried
wrapped
in
the
coverlet
but
he
ran
on
till
he
reached
the
stairs
and
he
climbed
them
and
entering
a
room
in
the
looking
over
the
moat
he
laid
the
princess
osra
on
a
couch
and
standing
over
her
he
smote
one
hand
upon
the
other
and
he
swore
loudly
now
as
god
lives
zenda
i
will
have
and
her
i
will
have
and
it
shall
be
her
husband
whom
she
must
if
she
will
proclaim
a
cheat
in
strelsau
then
he
bent
down
and
lifted
the
coverlet
from
her
face
but
she
did
not
stir
nor
speak
nor
open
her
eyes
for
she
had
fallen
into
a
swoon
as
they
rode
and
did
not
know
what
had
befallen
her
nor
where
she
had
been
brought
nor
that
she
was
now
in
the
castle
of
festenburg
and
in
the
power
of
a
desperate
man
thus
she
lay
still
and
white
while
count
nikolas
stood
over
her
and
bit
his
nails
in
rage
and
it
was
then
just
on
midnight
on
being
disturbed
for
the
third
time
the
bishop
of
modenstein
whose
temper
was
hot
and
cost
him
continual
prayers
and
penances
from
the
mastery
it
strove
to
win
over
him
was
very
impatient
and
since
he
was
at
once
angry
and
half
asleep
it
was
long
before
he
could
or
would
understand
the
monstrous
news
with
which
his
terrified
host
came
trembling
and
quaking
to
his
bedside
in
the
dead
of
the
night
a
stammered
the
frightened
fellow
had
run
down
half
dressed
and
panting
from
the
castle
of
zenda
and
declared
that
whether
they
chose
to
believe
her
or
not
and
indeed
she
could
hardly
believe
such
a
thing
herself
although
she
had
seen
it
with
her
own
eyes
from
her
own
window
yet
count
nikolas
of
festenburg
had
come
to
the
castle
that
evening
had
spoken
with
princess
osra
and
now
they
might
call
her
a
liar
if
they
chose
had
carried
off
the
princess
with
him
on
his
horse
to
festenburg
alive
or
dead
none
knew
and
the
were
amazed
and
terrified
and
the
soldiers
were
at
their
wits
end
talking
big
and
threatening
to
bring
ten
thousand
men
from
strelsau
and
to
leave
not
one
stone
upon
another
at
festenburg
and
what
not
but
all
the
while
and
for
all
their
big
talk
nothing
was
done
and
the
princess
was
at
festenburg
alive
or
dead
or
in
what
strait
none
knew
and
finally
nobody
but
one
poor
had
had
the
wit
to
run
down
and
rouse
the
town
the
bishop
of
modenstein
sat
up
in
his
bed
and
he
fairly
roared
at
the
innkeeper
are
there
no
men
then
who
can
fight
in
the
town
fool
none
none
my
lord
not
against
the
count
count
nikolas
is
a
terrible
man
please
god
he
has
not
killed
the
princess
by
now
saddle
my
horse
said
the
bishop
and
be
quick
with
it
and
he
leapt
out
of
bed
with
sparkling
eyes
for
the
bishop
was
a
young
man
but
a
little
turned
of
thirty
and
he
was
a
noble
of
the
old
house
of
hentzau
now
some
of
the
hentzaus
of
whom
history
tells
us
of
many
have
been
good
and
some
have
been
bad
and
the
good
fear
god
while
the
bad
do
not
but
neither
the
good
nor
the
bad
fear
anything
in
the
world
besides
hence
for
good
or
ill
they
do
great
deeds
and
risk
their
lives
as
another
man
risks
a
penny
so
the
bishop
leaving
his
bed
dressed
himself
in
breeches
and
boots
and
set
a
black
hat
with
a
violet
feather
on
his
head
and
staying
to
put
on
nothing
else
but
his
shirt
and
his
cloak
over
it
in
ten
minutes
was
on
his
horse
at
the
door
of
the
inn
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
a
straggling
crowd
that
had
gathered
there
then
with
a
toss
of
his
head
and
a
curl
of
his
lip
he
told
them
what
he
thought
of
them
saying
openly
that
he
thanked
heaven
they
were
not
of
his
diocese
and
in
an
instant
he
was
galloping
through
the
streets
of
the
town
towards
the
castle
of
festenburg
with
his
sword
by
his
side
and
a
brace
of
pistols
in
the
holsters
of
the
saddle
thus
he
left
the
gossipers
and
vapourers
behind
and
rode
alone
as
he
was
up
the
hill
his
blood
leaping
and
his
heart
beating
quick
for
as
he
went
he
said
to
himself
it
is
not
often
a
churchman
has
a
chance
like
this
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
he
came
to
the
bridge
of
the
castle
moat
and
the
bridge
was
up
but
the
bishop
shouted
and
the
watchman
came
out
and
stood
in
the
gateway
across
the
moat
and
the
night
being
fine
and
clear
he
presented
an
excellent
aim
my
pistol
is
straight
at
your
head
cried
the
bishop
let
down
the
bridge
i
am
frederick
of
hentzau
that
is
i
am
the
bishop
of
modenstein
and
i
charge
you
if
you
are
a
dutiful
son
of
the
church
to
obey
me
the
pistol
is
full
at
your
head
the
watchman
knew
the
bishop
but
he
also
knew
the
count
his
master
i
dare
not
let
down
the
bridge
without
an
order
from
my
lord
he
faltered
then
before
you
can
turn
round
you
a
dead
man
said
the
bishop
will
you
hold
me
harmless
with
my
lord
if
i
let
it
down
aye
he
shall
not
hurt
you
but
if
you
do
not
immediately
let
it
down
i
shoot
you
first
and
refuse
you
christian
burial
afterwards
come
down
with
it
so
the
watchman
fearing
that
if
he
refused
the
bishop
would
spare
neither
body
nor
soul
but
would
destroy
the
one
and
damn
the
other
let
down
the
bridge
and
the
bishop
leaping
from
his
horse
ran
across
with
his
drawn
sword
in
one
hand
and
a
pistol
in
the
other
walking
into
the
hall
he
found
a
great
company
of
count
nikolas
men
drinking
with
one
another
but
talking
uneasily
and
seeming
alarmed
and
the
bishop
raised
the
hand
that
held
the
sword
above
his
head
in
the
attitude
of
benediction
saying
peace
be
with
you
most
of
them
knew
him
by
his
face
and
all
knew
him
as
soon
as
a
comrade
whispered
his
name
and
they
sprang
to
their
feet
uncovering
their
heads
and
bowing
and
he
said
where
is
your
master
the
count
the
count
is
upstairs
my
lord
they
answered
you
can
not
see
him
now
nay
but
i
will
see
him
said
the
bishop
we
are
ordered
to
let
none
pass
said
they
and
although
their
manner
was
full
of
respect
they
spread
themselves
across
the
hall
and
thus
barred
the
way
to
the
staircase
that
rose
in
the
corner
of
the
hall
but
the
bishop
faced
them
in
great
anger
crying
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
what
has
been
done
are
you
all
then
parties
in
this
treachery
do
you
all
want
to
swing
from
the
turrets
of
the
castle
when
the
king
comes
with
a
thousand
men
from
strelsau
at
this
they
looked
at
him
and
at
one
another
with
great
uneasiness
for
they
knew
that
the
king
had
no
mercy
when
he
was
roused
and
that
he
loved
his
sister
above
everybody
in
the
world
and
the
bishop
stepped
up
close
to
their
rank
then
one
of
them
drew
his
sword
from
its
scabbard
but
the
bishop
perceiving
this
cried
do
you
all
do
violence
to
a
lady
and
dare
to
lay
hands
on
the
sister
aye
and
here
is
a
fellow
that
would
strike
a
bishop
of
church
and
he
caught
the
fellow
a
buffet
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
that
knocked
him
down
let
me
pass
you
rogues
said
the
bishop
do
you
think
you
can
stop
a
hentzau
let
us
go
and
tell
the
count
that
my
lord
the
bishop
is
here
cried
the
thinking
that
he
had
found
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
for
they
dared
neither
to
touch
the
bishop
nor
yet
to
let
him
through
and
the
steward
turned
to
run
towards
the
staircase
but
the
bishop
sprang
after
him
quick
as
an
arrow
and
dropping
the
pistol
from
his
left
hand
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
and
hurled
him
back
i
want
no
announcing
he
said
the
church
is
free
to
enter
everywhere
and
he
burst
through
them
at
the
point
of
the
sword
reckless
now
what
might
befall
him
so
that
he
made
his
way
through
but
they
did
not
venture
to
cut
him
down
for
they
knew
that
nothing
but
death
would
stop
him
and
for
their
very
souls
sake
they
dared
not
kill
him
so
he
kicking
one
and
pushing
another
and
laying
about
him
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
with
his
free
hand
and
reminding
them
all
the
while
of
their
duty
to
the
church
and
of
his
sacred
character
at
last
made
his
way
through
and
stood
alone
unhurt
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
while
they
cowered
by
the
walls
or
looked
at
him
in
stupid
helplessness
and
bewilderment
and
the
bishop
swiftly
mounted
the
stairs
at
this
instant
in
the
room
in
the
of
the
castle
overlooking
the
moat
there
had
fallen
a
moment
of
dead
silence
here
count
nikolas
had
raised
the
princess
set
her
on
a
couch
and
waited
till
her
faintness
and
fright
were
gone
then
he
had
come
near
to
her
and
in
brief
harsh
tones
told
her
his
mind
for
him
indeed
the
dice
were
now
cast
in
his
fury
and
fear
he
had
dared
all
he
was
calm
now
with
the
calmness
of
a
man
at
a
great
turn
of
fate
that
room
he
told
her
she
should
never
leave
alive
save
as
his
promised
wife
sworn
and
held
to
secrecy
and
silence
by
the
force
of
that
bond
and
of
her
oath
if
he
killed
her
he
must
die
whether
by
his
own
hand
or
the
king
mattered
little
but
he
would
die
for
a
great
cause
and
in
a
great
venture
i
shall
not
be
called
a
cheating
gamester
madame
said
he
a
smile
on
his
pale
face
i
choose
death
sooner
than
disgrace
such
is
my
choice
what
is
yours
it
stands
between
death
and
silence
and
no
man
but
your
husband
will
dare
to
trust
your
silence
you
do
not
dare
to
kill
me
said
she
defiantly
madame
i
dare
do
nothing
else
they
may
write
on
my
tomb
they
shall
not
throw
in
my
living
face
i
will
not
be
silent
cried
osra
springing
to
her
feet
and
rather
than
be
your
wife
i
would
die
a
thousand
times
for
a
cheat
you
are
a
cheat
a
cheat
her
voice
rose
till
he
feared
that
she
would
be
heard
if
any
one
chanced
to
listen
even
from
so
far
off
as
the
hall
yet
he
made
one
more
effort
seeking
to
move
her
by
an
appeal
to
which
women
are
not
wont
to
be
insensible
a
cheat
yes
said
he
i
nikolas
of
festenburg
am
a
cheat
i
say
it
though
no
other
man
shall
while
i
live
to
hear
him
but
to
gain
what
stake
why
my
brother
castle
of
zenda
i
swear
to
you
it
was
not
he
cried
coming
nearer
to
her
i
did
not
fear
losing
on
the
cast
but
i
could
not
endure
not
to
win
not
my
stake
madame
but
yours
lured
me
to
my
foul
play
have
you
your
face
and
yet
do
not
know
to
what
it
drives
men
if
i
have
a
fair
face
it
should
inspire
fair
deeds
said
she
do
not
touch
me
sir
do
not
touch
me
i
loathe
breathing
the
same
air
with
you
or
so
much
as
seeing
your
face
aye
and
i
can
die
even
the
women
of
our
house
know
how
to
die
at
her
scorn
and
contempt
a
great
rage
came
upon
him
and
he
gripped
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
drew
it
from
the
scabbard
but
she
stood
still
facing
him
with
calm
eyes
her
lips
moved
for
a
moment
in
prayer
but
she
did
not
shrink
i
pray
you
said
he
in
trembling
speech
mastering
himself
for
an
instant
i
pray
you
but
he
could
say
no
more
i
will
cry
your
cheating
in
all
strelsau
said
she
then
commend
your
soul
to
god
for
in
one
minute
you
shall
die
still
she
stood
motionless
and
he
began
to
come
near
to
her
his
sword
now
drawn
in
his
hand
having
come
within
the
distance
from
which
he
could
strike
her
he
paused
and
gazed
into
her
eyes
she
answered
him
with
a
smile
then
there
was
for
an
instant
the
utter
stillness
in
the
room
and
in
that
instant
the
bishop
of
modenstein
set
his
foot
on
the
staircase
and
came
running
up
on
a
sudden
osra
heard
the
step
and
a
gleam
flashed
in
her
eye
the
count
heard
it
also
and
his
sword
was
arrested
in
its
stroke
a
smile
came
on
his
face
he
was
glad
at
the
coming
of
some
one
whom
he
might
kill
in
fight
for
it
turned
him
sick
to
butcher
her
unresisting
yet
he
dared
not
let
her
go
to
cry
his
cheating
in
the
streets
of
strelsau
the
steps
came
nearer
he
dropped
his
sword
on
the
floor
and
sprang
upon
her
a
shriek
rang
out
but
he
pressed
his
hand
on
her
mouth
and
seized
her
in
his
arms
she
had
no
strength
to
resist
and
he
carried
her
swiftly
across
the
room
to
a
door
in
the
wall
he
pulled
the
door
open
it
was
very
heavy
and
massive
and
he
flung
her
down
roughly
on
the
stone
floor
of
a
little
chamber
square
and
lofty
having
but
one
small
window
high
up
through
which
the
moonlight
scarcely
pierced
she
fell
with
a
moan
of
pain
unheeding
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
shut
the
door
and
as
he
turned
he
heard
a
man
throw
himself
against
the
door
of
the
room
it
also
was
strong
and
twice
the
man
hurled
himself
with
all
his
force
against
it
at
last
it
strained
and
gave
way
and
the
bishop
of
modenstein
burst
into
the
room
breathless
and
he
saw
no
trace
of
the
princess
presence
but
only
count
nikolas
standing
sword
in
hand
in
front
of
the
door
in
the
wall
with
a
sneering
smile
on
his
face
the
bishop
of
modenstein
never
loved
to
speak
afterwards
of
what
followed
saying
always
that
he
rather
deplored
than
gloried
in
it
and
that
when
a
man
of
sacred
profession
was
forced
to
use
the
weapons
of
this
world
it
was
a
matter
of
grief
to
him
not
of
vaunting
but
the
king
compelled
him
by
urgent
requests
to
describe
the
whole
affair
while
the
princess
was
never
weary
of
telling
all
that
she
knew
or
of
blessing
all
bishops
for
the
sake
of
the
bishop
of
modenstein
yet
the
bishop
blamed
himself
perhaps
if
the
truth
were
known
not
for
the
necessity
that
drove
him
to
do
what
he
did
as
much
as
for
a
secret
and
ashamed
joy
which
he
detected
in
himself
for
certainly
as
he
burst
into
the
room
now
there
was
no
sign
of
reluctance
or
unwillingness
in
his
face
he
took
off
his
feathered
hat
bowed
politely
to
the
count
and
resting
the
point
of
his
sword
on
the
floor
asked
my
lord
where
is
the
princess
illustration
lord
where
is
the
princess
what
do
you
want
here
and
who
are
you
cried
the
count
with
a
blasphemous
oath
when
we
were
boys
together
you
knew
frederick
of
hentzau
do
you
not
now
know
the
bishop
of
modenstein
bishop
this
is
no
place
for
bishops
get
back
to
your
prayers
my
lord
it
wants
some
time
yet
before
matins
answered
the
bishop
my
lord
where
is
the
princess
what
do
you
want
with
her
i
am
here
to
escort
her
wherever
it
may
be
her
pleasure
to
go
he
spoke
confidently
but
he
was
in
his
heart
alarmed
and
uneasy
because
he
had
not
found
the
princess
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
said
nikolas
of
festenburg
my
lord
you
lie
said
the
bishop
of
modenstein
the
count
had
wanted
nothing
but
an
excuse
for
attacking
the
intruder
he
had
it
now
and
an
angry
flush
mounted
in
his
cheeks
as
he
walked
across
to
where
the
bishop
stood
shifting
his
sword
which
he
had
picked
up
again
to
his
left
hand
he
struck
the
bishop
on
the
face
with
his
gloved
hand
the
bishop
smiled
and
turned
the
other
cheek
to
count
nikolas
who
struck
again
with
all
his
force
so
that
he
reeled
back
catching
hold
of
the
open
door
to
avoid
falling
and
the
blood
started
dull
red
under
the
skin
of
his
face
but
he
still
smiled
and
bowed
saying
i
find
nothing
about
the
third
blow
in
holy
scripture
at
this
instant
the
princess
osra
who
had
been
half
stunned
by
the
violence
with
which
nikolas
had
thrown
her
on
the
floor
came
to
her
full
senses
and
hearing
the
bishop
voice
she
cried
out
loudly
for
help
he
hearing
her
darted
in
an
instant
across
the
room
and
was
at
the
door
of
the
little
chamber
before
the
count
could
stop
him
he
pulled
the
door
open
and
osra
sprang
out
to
him
saying
save
me
save
me
you
are
safe
madame
have
no
fear
answered
the
bishop
and
turning
to
the
count
he
continued
let
us
go
outside
my
lord
and
discuss
this
matter
our
dispute
will
disturb
and
perhaps
alarm
the
princess
and
a
man
might
have
read
the
purpose
in
his
eyes
though
his
manner
and
words
were
gentle
for
he
had
sworn
in
his
heart
that
the
count
should
not
escape
but
the
count
cared
as
little
for
the
presence
of
the
princess
as
he
had
for
her
dignity
her
honour
or
her
life
and
now
that
she
was
no
longer
wholly
at
his
mercy
but
there
was
a
new
chance
that
she
might
escape
his
rage
and
the
fear
of
exposure
lashed
him
to
fury
and
without
more
talking
he
made
at
the
bishop
crying
you
first
and
then
her
i
be
rid
of
the
pair
of
you
the
bishop
faced
him
standing
between
princess
osra
and
his
assault
while
she
shrank
back
a
little
sheltering
herself
behind
the
heavy
door
for
although
she
had
been
ready
to
die
without
fear
yet
the
sight
of
men
fighting
frightened
her
and
she
veiled
her
face
with
her
hands
and
waited
in
dread
to
hear
the
sound
of
their
swords
clashing
but
the
bishop
looked
very
happy
and
setting
his
hat
on
his
head
with
a
jaunty
air
he
stood
on
guard
for
ten
years
or
more
he
had
not
used
his
sword
but
the
secret
of
its
mastery
seemed
to
revive
fresh
and
clear
in
his
mind
and
let
his
soul
say
what
it
would
his
body
rejoiced
to
be
at
the
exercise
again
so
that
his
blood
kindled
and
his
eyes
gleamed
in
the
glee
of
strife
thus
he
stepped
forward
guarding
himself
and
thus
he
met
the
count
impetuous
onset
he
neither
flinched
nor
gave
back
but
finding
himself
holding
his
own
he
pressed
on
and
on
not
violently
attacking
and
yet
never
resting
and
turning
every
thrust
with
a
wrist
of
iron
and
while
osra
now
gazed
with
wide
eyes
and
breath
and
count
nikolas
muttered
oaths
and
grew
more
furious
the
bishop
seemed
as
gay
as
when
he
talked
to
the
king
more
gaily
may
be
than
bishops
should
again
his
eye
danced
as
in
the
days
when
he
had
been
called
the
wildest
of
the
hentzaus
and
still
he
drove
count
nikolas
back
and
back
now
behind
the
count
was
a
window
which
he
himself
had
caused
to
be
enlarged
and
made
low
and
wide
in
order
that
he
might
look
from
it
over
the
surrounding
country
in
time
of
war
it
was
covered
with
a
close
and
strong
iron
grating
but
now
the
grating
was
off
and
the
window
open
and
beneath
the
window
was
a
fall
of
fifty
feet
or
hard
upon
it
into
the
moat
below
the
count
looking
into
the
bishop
face
and
seeing
him
smile
suddenly
recollected
the
window
and
fancied
it
was
the
design
to
drive
him
on
to
it
so
that
he
could
give
back
no
more
and
since
he
knew
by
now
that
the
bishop
was
his
master
with
the
sword
a
despairing
rage
settled
upon
him
determining
to
die
swiftly
since
die
he
must
he
rushed
forward
making
a
desperate
lunge
at
his
enemy
but
the
bishop
parried
the
lunge
and
always
seeming
to
be
about
to
run
the
count
through
the
body
again
forced
him
to
retreat
till
his
back
was
close
to
the
opening
of
the
window
here
nikolas
stood
his
eyes
glaring
like
a
madman
then
a
sudden
devilish
smile
spread
over
his
face
will
you
yield
yourself
my
lord
cried
the
bishop
putting
a
restraint
on
the
wicked
impulse
to
kill
the
man
and
lowering
his
point
for
an
instant
illustration
he
drove
his
sword
into
his
body
and
the
count
gave
back
before
it
in
that
short
moment
the
count
made
his
last
throw
for
all
at
once
as
it
seemed
and
almost
in
one
motion
he
thrust
and
wounded
the
bishop
in
the
left
side
of
his
body
high
in
the
chest
near
the
shoulder
and
though
the
wound
was
slight
the
blood
flowed
freely
then
drawing
back
his
sword
he
seized
it
by
the
blade
up
and
flung
it
like
a
javelin
at
the
princess
who
stood
still
by
the
door
breathlessly
watching
the
fight
by
an
ace
it
missed
her
head
and
it
pinned
a
tress
of
her
hair
to
the
door
and
quivered
in
the
wood
of
the
door
when
the
bishop
of
modenstein
saw
this
hesitation
and
mercy
passed
out
of
his
heart
and
though
the
man
had
now
no
weapon
he
thought
of
sparing
him
no
more
than
he
would
have
spared
any
cruel
and
savage
beast
but
he
drove
his
sword
into
his
body
and
the
count
not
being
able
to
endure
the
thrust
without
flinching
against
his
own
will
gave
back
before
it
then
came
from
his
lips
a
loud
cry
of
dismay
and
despair
for
at
the
same
moment
that
the
sword
was
in
him
he
staggering
back
fell
wounded
to
death
through
the
open
window
the
bishop
looked
out
after
him
and
princess
osra
heard
the
sound
of
a
great
splash
in
the
water
of
the
moat
below
for
very
horror
she
sank
against
the
door
seeming
to
be
held
up
more
by
the
sword
that
had
pinned
her
hair
than
by
her
own
strength
then
came
up
through
the
window
from
which
the
bishop
still
looked
with
a
strange
smile
the
clatter
of
a
hundred
feet
running
to
the
gate
of
the
castle
the
bridge
was
let
down
the
confused
sound
of
many
men
talking
of
whispers
of
shouts
and
of
cries
of
horror
mounted
up
through
the
air
for
the
count
men
in
the
hall
also
had
heard
the
splash
and
run
out
to
see
what
it
was
and
there
they
beheld
the
body
of
their
master
dead
in
the
moat
their
eyes
were
wide
open
and
they
could
hardly
lay
their
tongues
to
the
words
as
they
pointed
to
the
body
and
whispered
to
one
another
very
low
the
bishop
has
killed
him
the
bishop
has
killed
him
but
the
bishop
saw
them
from
the
window
and
leant
out
crying
yes
i
have
killed
him
so
perish
all
such
villains
when
they
looked
up
and
saw
in
the
moonlight
the
bishop
face
they
were
amazed
but
he
hastily
drew
his
head
in
so
that
they
might
not
see
him
any
more
for
he
knew
that
his
face
had
been
fierce
and
exultant
and
joyful
then
dropping
his
sword
he
ran
across
to
the
princess
he
drew
the
count
sword
which
was
wet
with
his
own
blood
out
of
the
door
releasing
the
princess
hair
and
seeing
that
she
was
very
faint
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
led
her
to
the
couch
she
sank
upon
it
trembling
and
white
as
her
white
gown
and
murmuring
fearful
fearful
and
she
clutched
his
arm
and
for
a
long
while
she
would
not
let
him
go
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
count
sword
that
lay
on
the
floor
by
the
entrance
of
the
little
room
courage
madame
said
the
bishop
softly
all
danger
is
past
the
villain
is
dead
and
you
are
with
the
most
devoted
of
your
servants
yes
yes
she
said
and
pressed
his
arm
and
shivered
is
he
really
dead
he
is
dead
god
have
mercy
on
him
said
the
bishop
and
you
killed
him
i
killed
him
if
it
were
a
sin
pray
god
forgive
me
up
through
the
window
still
came
the
noise
of
voices
and
the
stir
of
men
moving
for
they
were
recovering
the
body
of
the
count
from
the
moat
yet
neither
osra
nor
the
bishop
noticed
any
longer
what
was
passing
he
was
intent
on
her
and
she
seemed
hardly
yet
herself
but
suddenly
before
he
could
interpose
she
threw
herself
off
the
couch
and
on
to
her
knees
in
front
of
him
and
seizing
hold
of
his
hand
she
kissed
first
the
episcopal
ring
that
he
wore
and
then
his
hand
for
he
was
both
bishop
and
a
gallant
gentleman
and
a
kiss
she
gave
him
for
each
and
after
she
had
kissed
his
hand
she
held
it
in
both
of
hers
as
though
for
safety
sake
she
clung
to
it
but
he
raised
her
hastily
crying
to
her
not
to
kneel
before
him
and
throwing
away
his
hat
he
knelt
before
her
kissing
her
hands
many
times
she
seemed
now
recovered
from
her
bewilderment
and
terror
for
as
she
looked
down
on
him
kneeling
she
was
between
tears
and
smiles
and
with
curving
lips
but
wet
shining
eyes
she
said
very
softly
ah
my
lord
who
made
a
bishop
of
you
and
her
cheeks
grew
in
an
instant
from
dead
white
into
sudden
red
and
her
hand
moved
over
his
head
as
if
she
would
fain
have
touched
him
with
it
and
she
bent
down
ever
so
little
towards
him
yet
perhaps
it
was
nothing
any
lady
who
had
seen
how
he
bore
himself
and
knew
that
it
was
in
her
cause
for
her
honour
and
life
might
well
have
done
the
same
the
bishop
of
modenstein
made
no
immediate
answer
his
head
was
still
bowed
over
her
hand
and
after
a
while
he
kissed
her
hand
again
and
he
felt
her
hand
press
his
then
suddenly
as
though
in
alarm
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
he
let
it
go
easily
then
he
raised
his
eyes
and
met
the
glance
of
hers
and
he
smiled
and
osra
also
smiled
for
an
instant
they
were
thus
then
the
bishop
rose
to
his
feet
and
he
stood
before
her
with
bent
head
and
eyes
that
sought
the
ground
in
becoming
humility
it
is
by
god
infinite
goodness
and
divine
permission
that
i
hold
my
sacred
office
said
he
i
would
that
i
were
more
worthy
of
it
but
i
have
taken
pleasure
in
the
killing
of
a
man
and
in
the
saving
of
a
lady
sir
she
added
softly
who
will
ever
count
you
among
her
dearest
friends
and
the
most
gallant
of
her
defenders
is
god
angry
at
such
a
deed
as
that
may
he
forgive
us
all
our
sins
said
the
bishop
gravely
but
what
other
sins
he
had
in
his
mind
he
did
not
say
nor
did
the
princess
ask
him
then
he
gave
her
his
arm
and
they
two
walked
together
down
the
stairs
into
the
hall
the
bishop
having
forgotten
both
his
hat
and
his
sword
was
and
had
no
weapon
in
his
hand
the
count
men
were
all
collected
in
the
hall
being
crowded
round
a
table
that
stood
by
the
wall
for
on
the
table
lay
the
body
of
count
nikolas
of
festenburg
and
it
was
covered
with
a
that
one
of
the
servants
had
thrown
over
it
but
when
the
men
saw
the
princess
and
the
bishop
they
made
way
for
them
and
stood
aside
bowing
low
as
they
passed
you
bow
now
said
osra
but
before
none
of
you
would
lift
a
finger
for
me
to
my
lord
the
bishop
alone
do
i
owe
my
life
and
he
is
a
churchman
while
you
were
free
to
fight
for
me
for
my
part
i
do
not
envy
your
wives
such
husbands
and
with
a
most
scornful
air
she
passed
between
their
ranks
taking
great
and
ostentatious
care
not
to
touch
one
of
them
even
with
the
hem
of
her
gown
at
this
they
grew
red
and
shuffled
on
their
feet
and
one
or
two
swore
under
their
breath
and
thanked
god
their
wives
were
not
such
shrews
being
indeed
very
much
ashamed
of
themselves
and
very
uneasy
at
thinking
what
these
same
wives
of
theirs
would
say
to
them
when
the
thing
came
to
be
known
but
osra
and
the
bishop
passed
over
the
bridge
and
he
set
her
on
his
horse
the
summer
morning
had
just
dawned
clear
and
fair
so
that
the
sun
caught
her
ruddy
hair
as
she
mounted
in
her
white
gown
but
the
bishop
took
the
bridle
of
the
horse
and
led
it
at
a
foot
pace
down
the
hill
and
into
the
town
now
by
this
time
the
news
of
what
had
chanced
had
run
all
through
the
town
and
the
people
were
out
in
the
streets
gossiping
and
guessing
and
when
they
saw
the
princess
osra
safe
and
sound
and
smiling
and
the
bishop
in
his
shirt
for
he
had
given
his
cloak
to
her
leading
the
horse
they
broke
into
great
cheering
the
men
cheered
the
princess
while
the
women
thrust
themselves
to
the
front
rank
of
the
crowd
and
blessed
the
bishop
of
modenstein
but
he
walked
with
his
head
down
and
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
would
not
look
up
even
when
the
women
cried
out
in
great
fear
and
admiration
on
seeing
that
his
shirt
was
stained
with
his
blood
and
with
the
blood
of
nikolas
of
festenburg
that
had
spurted
out
upon
it
but
one
thing
the
princess
heard
which
sent
her
cheeks
red
again
for
a
buxom
girl
glanced
merrily
at
her
and
made
bold
to
say
in
a
tone
that
the
princess
could
not
but
hear
illustration
he
walked
with
his
head
down
and
his
eyes
on
the
ground
by
the
saints
here
waste
if
he
were
not
a
churchman
now
and
her
laughing
eye
travelled
from
the
princess
to
him
and
back
to
the
princess
again
shall
we
go
a
little
faster
whispered
osra
bending
down
to
the
bishop
but
the
girl
only
thought
that
she
whispered
something
else
and
laughed
the
more
at
last
they
passed
the
town
and
with
a
great
crowd
still
following
them
came
to
the
castle
at
the
gate
of
it
the
bishop
stopped
and
aided
the
princess
to
alight
again
he
knelt
and
kissed
her
hand
saying
only
madame
farewell
farewell
my
lord
said
osra
softly
and
she
went
hastily
into
the
castle
while
the
bishop
returned
to
his
inn
in
the
town
and
though
the
people
stood
round
the
inn
the
best
part
of
the
day
calling
and
watching
for
him
he
would
not
shew
himself
in
the
evening
of
that
day
the
king
having
heard
the
tidings
of
the
crime
of
count
nikolas
came
in
furious
haste
with
a
troop
of
horse
from
strelsau
and
when
he
heard
how
osra
had
played
at
dice
with
the
count
and
staking
herself
against
the
castle
of
zenda
had
won
it
back
he
was
ashamed
and
swore
an
oath
that
he
would
play
dice
no
more
which
oath
he
faithfully
observed
but
in
the
morning
of
the
next
day
he
went
to
festenburg
where
he
flogged
soundly
every
man
who
had
not
run
away
before
his
coming
and
all
the
possessions
of
count
nikolas
he
confiscated
and
he
pulled
down
the
castle
of
festenburg
and
filled
up
the
moat
that
had
run
round
its
walls
then
he
sent
for
the
bishop
of
modenstein
and
thanked
him
offering
to
him
all
the
demesne
of
count
nikolas
but
the
bishop
would
not
accept
it
nor
any
mark
of
the
king
favour
not
even
the
order
of
the
red
rose
therefore
the
king
granted
the
ground
on
which
the
castle
stood
and
all
the
lands
belonging
to
it
to
francis
of
tarlenheim
to
the
wife
of
prince
henry
who
built
the
which
now
stands
there
and
belongs
to
the
same
family
to
this
day
but
the
bishop
of
modenstein
having
been
entertained
by
the
king
with
great
splendour
for
two
days
would
not
stay
longer
but
set
out
to
pursue
his
journey
clad
now
in
his
ecclesiastical
garments
and
princess
osra
sat
by
her
window
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
and
watching
him
till
the
trees
of
the
forest
hid
him
and
once
when
he
was
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
he
turned
his
face
for
an
instant
and
looked
back
at
her
where
she
sat
watching
in
the
window
thus
he
went
to
strelsau
and
when
he
was
come
there
he
sent
immediately
for
his
confessor
and
the
confessor
having
heard
him
laid
upon
him
a
severe
penance
which
he
performed
with
great
zeal
exactness
and
contrition
but
whether
the
penance
were
for
killing
count
nikolas
of
festenburg
which
in
a
layman
at
least
would
have
seemed
but
a
venial
sin
or
for
what
else
who
shall
say
chapter
vi
the
device
of
giraldo
the
painter
when
the
birthday
of
the
princess
osra
approached
her
brother
king
rudolf
desiring
to
make
her
a
present
summoned
from
his
home
at
verona
in
italy
a
painter
of
very
high
fame
by
name
giraldo
and
commanded
him
to
paint
a
portrait
of
the
princess
to
be
her
brother
gift
to
her
this
command
giraldo
carried
out
the
princess
giving
him
every
opportunity
of
studying
her
features
and
grudging
no
time
that
was
spent
by
her
in
front
of
his
easel
and
the
picture
when
finished
being
pronounced
to
be
as
faithful
as
beautiful
the
reputation
of
giraldo
was
greatly
enhanced
by
the
painting
of
it
thus
it
followed
that
in
many
cases
when
foreign
princes
had
heard
the
widespread
praises
of
osra
beauty
they
sent
orders
to
giraldo
to
execute
for
them
and
despatch
with
all
speed
miniatures
or
other
portraits
of
the
princess
that
they
might
judge
for
themselves
whether
she
were
in
truth
as
lovely
as
report
said
and
they
sent
giraldo
large
sums
of
money
in
recompense
adding
not
seldom
some
further
donation
on
the
express
term
and
condition
that
giraldo
should
observe
absolute
fidelity
in
his
representation
and
not
permit
himself
the
least
flattery
for
some
desired
themselves
to
court
her
and
others
intended
their
sons
to
ask
her
hand
if
the
evidence
of
giraldo
portraits
satisfied
their
hopes
so
giraldo
although
but
two
or
three
years
above
thirty
grew
in
both
fame
and
wealth
and
was
very
often
indebted
to
the
princess
for
the
favour
of
a
visit
to
his
house
that
he
might
again
correct
his
memory
of
her
face
now
what
several
princes
had
done
before
it
chanced
that
the
king
of
glottenberg
also
did
and
giraldo
to
all
appearance
much
pleased
accepted
the
command
and
prayed
the
princess
to
visit
him
for
he
said
this
picture
was
to
be
larger
and
more
elaborate
than
the
rest
and
therefore
needed
more
study
of
her
so
the
princess
went
many
times
and
the
portrait
destined
for
the
king
of
glottenberg
who
was
said
to
be
seeking
a
suitable
alliance
for
his
eldest
son
grew
before
her
eyes
into
the
most
perfect
and
beautiful
presentment
of
her
which
the
skill
of
giraldo
had
ever
accomplished
surpassing
even
that
first
picture
which
he
had
painted
by
king
rudolf
command
the
king
made
no
doubt
that
so
soon
as
the
picture
had
reached
the
court
of
glottenberg
an
embassy
would
come
from
there
to
demand
the
hand
of
his
sister
for
the
crown
prince
a
proposal
which
he
would
have
received
with
much
pleasure
and
gratification
i
do
not
think
said
osra
tossing
her
head
that
any
such
embassy
will
come
sire
for
four
or
five
pictures
have
been
already
painted
by
signor
giraldo
in
like
manner
but
no
embassies
have
come
it
seems
that
my
poor
features
do
not
find
approval
in
the
courts
of
europe
her
tone
it
must
be
confessed
was
full
of
contempt
for
the
princess
osra
knew
that
she
was
beautiful
as
indeed
all
beautiful
ladies
are
by
the
benevolence
of
heaven
permitted
to
know
how
much
greater
mischief
might
they
work
if
such
knowledge
were
denied
them
that
true
enough
cried
rudolf
and
i
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
it
but
it
will
not
be
so
at
glottenberg
for
my
good
brother
the
king
has
eyes
in
his
head
and
his
son
sees
no
less
well
i
met
them
on
my
travels
and
i
can
speak
to
it
most
certainly
an
embassy
will
come
from
glottenberg
before
we
are
a
month
older
yet
strange
to
say
the
same
thing
followed
on
the
despatch
of
the
portrait
which
giraldo
sent
by
a
certain
trusty
messenger
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
employ
as
had
happened
before
no
embassy
came
and
the
king
of
glottenberg
excused
himself
from
paying
a
visit
to
strelsau
which
he
and
his
son
had
promised
on
the
invitation
of
king
rudolf
therefore
rudolf
was
very
vexed
and
osra
also
thinking
herself
scorned
was
very
sore
at
heart
although
she
bore
herself
more
proudly
than
before
but
being
very
greatly
disturbed
in
her
mind
concerning
her
beauty
she
went
herself
again
to
giraldo
and
charged
him
to
paint
her
once
more
this
picture
she
said
is
for
my
own
eyes
and
mine
alone
therefore
signor
paint
it
faithfully
and
spare
me
not
for
if
a
woman
be
ugly
it
is
well
she
should
know
it
and
it
seems
that
nobody
in
the
kingdom
will
tell
me
the
truth
although
i
get
hints
enough
of
it
from
abroad
and
she
frowned
and
flushed
and
was
very
sadly
out
of
temper
as
any
beautiful
lady
would
most
naturally
be
in
such
a
case
giraldo
bowed
very
low
seeking
to
hide
the
sudden
red
that
dyed
his
cheek
and
to
conceal
the
great
joy
which
the
command
of
the
princess
gave
him
for
by
reason
of
having
painted
the
princess
so
often
of
having
studied
her
face
so
curiously
and
of
having
spent
so
much
time
in
her
company
listening
to
her
conversation
and
enjoying
her
wit
and
grace
this
hapless
young
man
had
become
so
deeply
and
desperately
her
lover
that
he
no
longer
cared
to
use
his
brush
in
the
service
of
any
other
lady
or
lord
but
stayed
at
strelsau
solely
that
he
might
again
and
again
depict
the
face
that
he
loved
and
save
when
she
sat
before
him
he
seemed
now
unable
to
ply
his
art
at
all
and
had
he
not
received
so
many
commands
for
pictures
of
her
he
would
have
sat
all
day
long
idle
thinking
of
her
which
indeed
was
what
he
did
in
the
intervals
between
his
labour
on
her
portraits
but
she
not
imagining
such
presumption
and
folly
on
his
part
thought
that
he
was
glad
merely
because
she
would
pay
him
well
so
she
promised
him
more
and
more
if
he
would
but
paint
her
faithfully
and
he
gave
her
his
word
that
he
would
paint
her
in
every
respect
most
faithfully
i
desire
to
know
said
she
what
i
am
in
truth
like
for
my
mirror
says
one
thing
and
the
king
of
glottenberg
but
here
she
stopped
remembering
that
such
matters
were
not
fit
for
giraldo
ears
yet
he
must
have
understood
for
a
strange
cunning
exultant
smile
came
on
his
lips
as
he
turned
away
and
set
himself
to
mix
the
colours
on
his
palette
thus
he
began
this
last
picture
and
the
princess
came
every
day
and
stayed
long
so
that
giraldo
might
be
able
to
render
her
likeness
in
every
most
minute
respect
with
perfect
fidelity
for
she
thought
resentfully
either
i
have
no
eyes
or
they
have
none
in
glottenberg
when
she
had
been
visiting
giraldo
thus
for
hard
on
a
month
and
the
picture
was
nearly
finished
and
was
at
once
the
most
lovely
and
the
most
faithful
of
all
that
giraldo
had
painted
it
chanced
that
letters
came
to
the
king
from
a
nobleman
of
france
who
was
well
known
to
him
and
had
known
the
princess
well
also
the
marquis
de
m√©rosailles
and
the
marquis
wrote
to
the
king
in
the
greatest
indignation
and
scorn
upbraiding
the
king
and
saying
what
is
this
sire
do
you
keep
a
madman
at
your
court
and
call
him
a
painter
i
have
been
at
glottenberg
and
when
i
spoke
there
as
it
is
my
humble
duty
and
true
delight
to
speak
everywhere
of
the
incomparable
beauty
of
your
majesty
sister
the
princess
osra
the
king
his
son
and
all
the
company
did
nothing
but
laugh
i
fought
three
duels
with
gentlemen
of
the
court
on
this
account
and
two
of
them
i
heaven
helping
me
wounded
and
one
by
some
devil
trick
wounded
me
after
this
the
matter
coming
to
the
king
ear
he
sent
for
me
and
excused
the
laughter
by
showing
me
a
picture
done
by
a
rascal
called
giraldo
at
your
court
the
picture
was
named
after
your
majesty
most
matchless
sister
but
as
i
am
a
true
son
of
the
church
it
was
like
the
daughter
and
on
my
honour
and
conscience
it
squinted
most
villainously
i
pray
you
sire
find
out
the
meaning
of
this
thing
and
receive
most
humble
duty
and
homage
from
your
devoted
servant
and
since
your
graciousness
so
wills
it
most
obliged
and
obedient
friend
henri
marquis
de
m√©rosailles
i
kiss
the
hand
of
the
princess
when
king
rudolf
had
read
this
letter
he
grew
very
thoughtful
and
unknown
to
giraldo
he
sent
and
caught
the
messenger
whom
giraldo
was
wont
to
entrust
with
the
pictures
and
who
carried
the
picture
of
which
de
m√©rosailles
wrote
to
glottenberg
and
the
king
interrogated
the
messenger
most
closely
but
got
nothing
from
him
save
that
he
himself
never
beheld
the
pictures
which
he
carried
but
received
them
most
carefully
packed
from
giraldo
and
so
delivered
them
without
undoing
the
coverings
and
then
by
giraldo
strict
orders
returned
at
once
and
did
not
wait
until
the
recipient
had
inspected
the
picture
so
that
the
fellow
did
not
know
anything
about
the
picture
that
had
gone
to
glottenberg
except
that
it
was
certainly
the
same
as
giraldo
had
entrusted
to
his
hands
but
the
king
was
not
satisfied
and
learning
that
his
sister
was
at
that
moment
at
giraldo
house
being
painted
afresh
by
him
he
called
of
his
gentlemen
and
set
out
on
horseback
for
the
place
where
giraldo
lived
in
the
street
that
runs
from
the
cathedral
towards
the
western
gate
of
strelsau
to
this
day
the
house
stands
there
the
princess
sat
and
giraldo
painted
behind
the
princess
was
a
window
looking
on
to
the
street
and
behind
giraldo
was
a
second
door
which
led
into
an
inner
room
on
giraldo
easel
stood
the
nearly
finished
picture
giraldo
eyes
were
alight
both
with
love
and
with
triumph
as
he
turned
from
the
princess
to
the
picture
and
from
the
picture
to
the
princess
again
and
she
seeing
something
of
his
admiration
said
with
a
blush
is
it
indeed
faithful
signor
for
it
seemed
even
to
herself
a
marvellously
lovely
picture
no
madame
answered
he
for
my
imperfect
hand
can
not
be
faithful
to
perfection
i
pray
you
do
not
flatter
me
have
you
indeed
shewn
every
fault
of
my
face
if
there
be
a
fault
in
your
face
madame
there
it
is
also
in
my
picture
said
giraldo
the
princess
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
said
it
is
better
is
it
not
than
the
picture
you
painted
for
the
king
of
glottenberg
giraldo
painted
a
stroke
or
two
before
he
answered
carelessly
indeed
madame
it
is
more
faithful
than
that
which
the
king
of
glottenberg
has
then
less
beautiful
asked
osra
with
a
petulant
smile
nay
i
do
not
say
that
not
less
beautiful
he
answered
perhaps
he
would
like
this
one
better
and
give
me
his
in
exchange
for
i
never
saw
his
after
it
was
finished
i
think
i
will
ask
the
king
to
write
to
him
giraldo
had
turned
round
suddenly
as
the
princess
made
this
suggestion
she
had
spoken
half
in
sport
half
in
continuing
chagrin
at
the
blindness
shewn
by
the
court
of
glottenberg
now
he
stood
staring
at
her
with
alarmed
eyes
and
he
dropped
his
brushes
on
to
the
floor
what
ails
you
signor
she
cried
i
did
but
suggest
exchanging
the
pictures
he
tried
to
regain
his
composure
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
his
brushes
the
king
of
glottenberg
picture
is
the
best
for
him
to
have
said
he
sullenly
this
one
madame
i
painted
for
you
yourself
and
for
you
alone
i
pay
the
price
and
can
do
what
i
will
with
the
picture
returned
the
princess
haughtily
if
i
desire
i
will
give
it
to
the
king
of
glottenberg
giraldo
had
now
turned
very
pale
and
forgetful
of
the
picture
stood
gazing
fixedly
at
the
princess
for
he
could
no
longer
hold
down
in
secrecy
and
silence
the
passion
that
possessed
him
but
it
was
declared
in
his
eyes
and
in
the
trembling
of
his
limbs
so
that
the
princess
rose
from
her
chair
and
shrank
away
from
him
in
alarm
regretting
that
she
had
dismissed
her
ladies
in
order
to
be
less
restrained
in
talk
with
the
painter
and
she
tried
to
cry
out
that
they
might
hear
her
where
they
were
in
an
adjoining
room
but
her
cry
froze
on
her
lips
at
the
sight
of
giraldo
passion
and
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
whisper
he
shall
not
have
the
picture
he
shall
not
have
it
as
he
spoke
he
moved
nearer
to
the
princess
who
still
shrank
away
from
him
being
now
in
very
great
alarm
and
thinking
that
surely
he
had
run
mad
yet
she
looked
at
him
and
looking
saw
whence
his
madness
came
and
she
felt
pity
for
him
and
held
out
her
clasped
hands
towards
him
saying
in
a
very
soft
voice
and
with
eyes
that
grew
sad
and
tender
ah
signor
signor
am
i
always
to
have
lovers
and
never
a
friend
at
this
the
unfortunate
painter
was
overcome
and
dropping
his
head
between
his
hands
he
gave
a
deep
sob
and
then
he
cried
god
curse
on
me
for
having
slandered
the
beauty
that
i
love
and
then
he
sobbed
again
but
the
princess
wondered
greatly
what
he
meant
by
his
strange
cry
and
turned
her
eyes
again
on
him
in
bewildered
questioning
saying
as
she
pointed
to
the
picture
there
is
no
slander
here
signor
unless
too
much
praise
be
slander
giraldo
made
her
no
answer
in
words
but
springing
towards
her
caught
her
by
the
wrist
and
drew
her
across
the
room
to
the
door
behind
his
easel
with
feverish
haste
he
unlocked
it
and
passed
through
the
princess
although
now
free
from
his
grip
followed
him
in
a
strange
fascination
giraldo
drew
the
door
close
behind
him
and
at
that
moment
the
princess
gave
a
cry
half
a
scream
half
laughter
for
facing
her
she
saw
each
on
its
easel
three
four
five
six
pictures
of
herself
each
beautiful
and
painted
most
lovingly
and
the
last
of
the
six
was
the
picture
that
had
been
painted
by
order
of
the
king
of
glottenberg
for
she
knew
it
by
the
attire
although
the
face
had
not
been
finished
when
she
had
last
seen
it
a
sudden
enlightenment
pierced
her
mind
and
she
knew
that
giraldo
had
not
sent
the
pictures
for
which
she
had
sat
to
him
but
kept
them
himself
and
sent
others
to
his
patrons
this
strange
conviction
found
its
sure
confirmation
in
a
seventh
easel
which
stood
apart
from
the
rest
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
for
it
supported
what
was
in
all
respects
a
copy
of
the
portrait
on
which
giraldo
was
now
engaged
save
that
by
cunning
touches
he
had
imparted
to
the
face
an
alien
and
fearful
aspect
for
here
although
the
features
had
their
shape
and
perfect
grace
yet
it
was
the
face
of
a
devil
that
looked
out
of
the
canvas
a
face
that
a
man
would
not
have
gazing
at
him
from
the
wall
on
to
the
bed
where
he
sought
to
sleep
but
when
giraldo
saw
her
eyes
fixed
on
this
picture
he
cried
that
is
for
you
the
other
is
mine
are
they
not
your
features
the
king
of
glottenberg
should
not
have
even
your
features
but
you
shall
have
them
and
if
a
devil
looks
out
through
such
a
fair
mask
is
it
not
so
with
all
fair
women
that
lead
men
to
destruction
there
is
your
true
picture
princess
osra
and
he
flung
himself
on
a
couch
with
a
mad
cry
of
rage
and
then
a
groan
of
despair
the
princess
osra
looked
at
him
and
at
the
beautiful
pictures
and
then
at
the
picture
that
was
like
her
and
yet
like
a
devil
first
she
pitied
the
painter
and
then
marvelled
at
the
wonderful
mad
skill
which
so
transformed
her
without
drawing
a
line
that
could
be
called
untrue
thus
thinking
she
stood
for
a
while
grave
and
puzzled
but
then
the
humour
struck
her
as
it
struck
her
house
always
in
great
things
and
in
small
it
seemed
to
her
most
ludicrous
that
the
pictures
should
all
be
resting
here
in
giraldo
house
while
the
princes
who
had
commanded
portraits
of
her
had
received
nothing
but
distorted
parodies
of
her
face
to
the
end
that
they
might
be
disgusted
and
abandoning
the
alliance
they
had
projected
leave
her
still
at
strelsau
to
be
painted
times
out
of
number
and
most
fruitlessly
by
this
mad
painter
and
these
thoughts
gaining
the
mastery
over
the
others
in
spite
of
the
sad
plight
of
unhappy
signor
giraldo
her
lips
curved
into
a
bow
her
eyes
gleamed
in
dancing
merriment
and
a
moment
later
she
broke
into
a
glad
gleeful
laugh
that
rose
and
rippled
and
fell
to
soft
delighted
murmurings
as
she
looked
again
at
the
picture
that
was
like
her
and
also
like
a
devil
her
mirth
grew
and
grew
at
the
ingenuity
of
the
work
and
the
mocking
devilry
so
cunningly
made
out
of
her
face
small
wonder
was
it
to
her
now
that
the
embassies
had
not
come
the
princess
osra
thus
stood
laughing
and
presently
signor
giraldo
looked
up
when
he
had
listened
and
looked
for
a
few
moments
his
wild
mood
caught
the
infection
from
her
so
that
springing
to
his
feet
he
also
began
to
laugh
loudly
like
a
man
who
can
not
restrain
his
amusement
but
is
carried
away
by
it
beyond
all
bounds
and
restraints
thus
giraldo
laughed
loudly
long
and
fiercely
for
there
was
madness
in
his
laugh
and
the
princess
heard
the
madness
even
while
she
still
laughed
her
eyes
opened
in
wonder
alarm
came
on
her
face
her
merry
laugh
quivered
trembled
choked
in
her
throat
and
at
last
died
away
into
dumbness
yet
her
lips
hung
apart
frozen
in
the
shape
of
laughter
while
no
laughter
came
but
as
her
laugh
thus
ended
in
mute
horror
his
grew
louder
yet
and
wilder
and
its
peal
rang
through
the
room
as
he
gasped
between
his
spasms
of
horrid
mirth
you
you
you
and
pointed
at
the
picture
which
he
had
touched
to
devilishness
but
she
shrank
away
and
stood
crouched
against
the
wall
for
she
knew
now
that
he
was
mad
but
did
not
know
to
what
his
fury
might
next
lead
him
then
he
caught
up
a
knife
that
lay
on
the
sill
of
the
window
and
now
smiling
as
though
in
grim
quiet
amusement
strode
across
to
the
row
of
pictures
and
reached
up
to
them
knife
in
hand
but
osra
suddenly
sprang
forward
crying
do
not
hurt
them
these
he
asked
turning
to
her
with
a
sneer
these
i
destroy
them
all
for
they
are
no
longer
beautiful
to
me
but
that
one
only
is
beautiful
because
it
is
true
and
he
wrenched
his
arm
away
from
the
detaining
hand
she
had
laid
upon
it
falling
back
in
terror
she
watched
him
cutting
and
slashing
each
of
the
pictures
until
the
face
was
utterly
destroyed
and
she
feared
that
when
he
had
finished
with
the
pictures
he
would
turn
upon
her
therefore
she
flung
herself
on
the
couch
hiding
her
face
for
fear
of
some
horrible
fate
she
murmured
low
to
herself
not
my
face
o
god
not
my
face
and
she
pressed
her
face
down
into
the
cushions
of
the
couch
while
he
muttering
and
grumbling
to
himself
cut
the
pictures
into
strips
and
ribbons
and
strewed
the
fragments
at
his
feet
on
the
floor
this
done
he
turned
to
the
face
that
he
loved
and
poured
out
to
it
as
though
it
had
been
a
cruel
idol
he
worshipped
a
flood
of
wild
passionate
reproachful
words
that
osra
shivered
to
hear
and
the
purport
of
which
she
dared
tell
none
though
for
all
her
prayers
she
could
not
herself
forget
one
of
them
at
last
he
came
to
her
again
and
plucked
her
roughly
and
rudely
from
the
couch
where
she
lay
and
dragged
her
behind
him
back
to
the
door
again
and
through
it
and
they
stood
together
in
front
of
the
last
picture
whose
paint
was
still
wet
from
his
hand
the
painted
face
smiled
down
on
the
trembling
pale
girl
with
its
smile
of
careless
serene
dignity
so
that
now
even
to
herself
it
seemed
hardly
to
be
her
picture
for
it
was
the
true
presentment
of
a
king
daughter
and
she
no
better
than
a
helpless
frightened
girl
it
seemed
to
reproach
her
and
suddenly
she
drew
herself
to
her
height
and
turned
on
giraldo
saying
you
shall
not
touch
it
she
stept
forward
so
that
she
stood
between
him
and
the
picture
raising
her
hand
and
forbidding
him
to
approach
it
with
his
knife
and
now
the
picture
seemed
more
to
be
hers
although
while
it
smiled
she
frowned
but
at
this
moment
there
came
through
the
window
that
opened
on
the
street
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
at
the
sound
giraldo
arrested
the
motion
that
he
had
already
made
to
fling
himself
on
the
princess
whether
to
kill
her
or
only
to
thrust
her
away
from
in
front
of
the
picture
she
did
not
know
running
to
the
window
he
looked
out
and
called
in
seeming
glee
it
is
the
king
come
to
see
my
pictures
and
he
looked
proud
and
happy
going
to
the
door
of
the
room
he
flung
it
open
and
stood
there
waiting
for
the
king
and
the
gentlemen
who
attended
the
king
they
were
not
long
in
coming
for
rudolf
was
full
of
anger
impatience
and
curiosity
and
ran
swiftly
up
the
staircase
his
gentlemen
pressed
into
the
room
behind
him
and
giraldo
drew
back
keeping
his
face
to
the
king
and
bowing
again
and
again
but
the
king
and
the
rest
saw
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
ragged
strips
of
painted
canvas
hung
here
and
there
on
his
clothes
while
the
princess
pale
and
proud
stood
guarding
the
picture
on
the
easel
the
king
in
spite
of
his
wonder
was
not
turned
from
the
purpose
which
had
brought
him
to
the
painter
house
but
with
a
quick
step
darted
up
to
giraldo
and
thrust
the
letter
of
the
marquis
de
m√©rosailles
into
his
hand
bidding
him
in
a
sharp
peremptory
tone
to
read
it
and
give
what
explanation
he
could
of
the
contents
giraldo
fell
to
reading
it
while
the
king
turned
to
his
sister
in
order
to
ask
her
why
she
seemed
agitated
and
stood
so
obstinately
in
front
of
her
own
picture
but
at
that
instant
one
of
the
gentlemen
whose
name
was
ladislas
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
for
he
had
looked
through
the
door
into
the
inner
room
and
seen
the
havoc
and
destruction
that
giraldo
had
made
and
also
the
strange
and
terrible
picture
which
alone
had
escaped
the
knife
the
king
wondering
followed
ladislas
to
the
threshold
of
the
inner
room
and
passed
it
while
his
gentlemen
full
of
curiosity
crowded
close
on
his
heels
after
him
the
princess
osra
thinking
herself
safe
found
her
anger
and
terror
pass
away
as
her
mirth
had
passed
before
now
she
felt
in
her
heart
that
pity
which
borders
on
tenderness
and
which
she
could
never
refuse
to
a
man
who
loved
her
let
the
folly
of
his
love
and
of
the
extravagances
into
which
it
drove
him
be
as
great
as
it
would
turning
towards
giraldo
she
saw
him
fretting
his
puckered
brow
with
his
hand
and
vainly
seeking
to
compel
his
disordered
brain
to
understand
de
m√©rosailles
letter
so
she
was
very
sorry
for
him
and
knowing
the
sudden
hot
temper
to
which
the
careless
king
was
subject
she
glided
swiftly
across
to
the
painter
and
whispered
escape
and
hide
hide
for
a
few
days
he
will
be
furious
now
but
he
will
soon
forget
do
wait
now
but
escape
signor
some
harm
will
happen
to
you
here
and
in
her
eager
pleading
with
him
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
in
his
face
with
imploring
eyes
but
he
looked
at
her
with
dazed
vacant
stare
muttering
i
can
not
read
the
letter
then
a
wistful
smile
came
on
his
face
and
he
thrust
the
letter
towards
her
saying
madame
will
you
read
it
for
me
and
at
that
moment
they
heard
the
king
swear
an
angry
oath
for
he
had
seen
the
mad
picture
of
his
sister
no
no
not
now
whispered
osra
beseeching
giraldo
not
now
signor
listen
the
king
is
angry
escape
now
and
we
will
read
the
letter
afterwards
she
was
as
earnest
as
though
she
had
loved
him
and
were
praying
him
to
save
himself
for
the
sake
of
her
love
giraldo
looked
into
her
softened
eyes
suddenly
giving
a
little
cry
as
if
a
great
joy
had
come
to
him
unexpectedly
and
contrary
to
all
likelihood
he
dropped
de
m√©rosailles
letter
and
sprang
to
where
his
brushes
lay
on
the
floor
seizing
them
and
his
palette
he
gave
another
swift
glance
at
the
princess
and
then
turning
to
the
picture
began
to
paint
with
marvellous
dexterity
and
deftness
and
with
the
sudden
confidence
of
a
man
inspired
to
the
work
as
he
worked
his
brow
grew
smoother
the
tension
of
his
strained
face
relaxed
happiness
dawned
in
his
eyes
and
a
smile
broke
on
his
lips
and
osra
watched
him
with
a
tender
sorrowful
gaze
still
he
painted
and
he
was
painting
when
the
king
burst
in
from
the
other
room
in
a
great
rage
carrying
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
for
he
had
sworn
by
our
lady
and
peter
to
kill
the
rogue
who
had
done
the
princess
such
wrong
and
so
slandered
her
beauty
and
his
gentlemen
came
in
with
him
all
very
ready
to
see
giraldo
killed
but
each
eager
that
the
king
should
leave
the
task
to
him
yet
when
they
entered
and
saw
giraldo
painting
as
though
he
were
rapt
by
some
ecstasy
and
had
forgotten
all
that
had
passed
nay
even
their
very
presence
they
paused
in
unwilling
and
constrained
hesitation
osra
raised
her
hand
to
bid
them
stay
still
where
they
were
and
not
interfere
with
giraldo
painting
for
now
she
desired
above
all
things
on
earth
that
he
should
be
left
to
finish
his
task
for
he
thought
that
he
had
read
more
than
pity
and
more
than
tenderness
in
osra
eyes
he
had
seemed
to
see
love
there
and
thus
he
had
cried
out
in
joy
and
thus
he
was
now
painting
as
never
had
even
he
for
all
his
skill
painted
before
his
unerring
hand
moving
lightly
to
and
fro
imparted
the
sweetness
of
his
delusive
vision
to
the
canvas
so
that
the
eyes
of
the
portrait
glowed
with
wonderful
and
beautiful
love
and
gentleness
presently
giraldo
began
to
sing
very
softly
to
himself
a
sweet
happy
old
song
that
peasants
sang
to
peasant
girls
in
the
fields
outside
his
native
verona
on
summer
evenings
his
head
was
thrown
back
in
triumph
and
exultation
as
he
sang
and
worked
tasting
the
luxury
of
love
and
glorying
in
the
tribute
that
his
genius
paid
to
her
whom
he
loved
thus
came
a
moment
of
great
joy
to
the
soul
of
giraldo
the
painter
for
a
man
love
and
a
man
work
are
when
they
seem
to
prosper
of
all
things
the
sweetest
and
their
union
in
one
his
consummation
it
was
done
he
laid
down
the
brush
and
drew
back
a
step
looking
at
what
he
had
done
the
princess
came
softly
and
slowly
as
though
attracted
against
her
will
and
she
stood
by
him
for
she
saw
that
this
picture
was
now
beyond
all
compare
the
most
perfect
and
beautiful
of
all
that
he
or
any
other
man
had
painted
of
her
and
she
loved
him
for
thus
glorifying
her
but
before
many
moments
had
gone
by
a
sudden
start
and
shiver
ran
through
giraldo
body
the
spell
of
his
entranced
ecstasy
broke
his
eyes
fell
from
the
masterpiece
that
he
had
made
and
wandered
to
those
who
stood
about
him
to
the
gentlemen
who
did
not
know
whether
to
wonder
or
to
laugh
to
the
angry
face
of
the
king
and
the
naked
sword
in
his
hand
at
last
to
osra
whose
eyes
were
still
on
the
picture
his
exultation
vanished
and
with
it
went
as
it
seemed
to
them
his
madness
reason
dawned
for
a
moment
in
his
eyes
but
was
quenched
in
an
instant
by
shame
and
despair
for
he
knew
that
all
there
had
seen
that
other
picture
and
knew
now
what
he
had
done
and
suddenly
with
a
stifled
cry
he
flung
himself
full
length
on
the
floor
at
feet
let
us
wait
said
she
gently
he
will
be
himself
again
soon
but
the
king
was
too
angry
to
listen
he
has
made
us
fools
before
half
europe
he
cried
angrily
and
he
shall
not
live
to
talk
of
it
and
you
have
you
seen
the
picture
yonder
yes
i
have
seen
it
said
she
but
he
does
not
now
think
that
picture
like
me
but
this
one
and
she
turned
to
the
gentlemen
and
desired
them
to
raise
giraldo
and
lay
him
on
a
couch
and
they
obeyed
then
she
knelt
by
his
head
and
after
a
while
he
opened
his
eyes
seeming
sound
of
sense
in
everything
except
that
he
believed
she
loved
him
so
that
he
began
to
whisper
to
her
as
lovers
whisper
to
their
loves
very
tenderly
and
low
and
the
king
with
his
gentlemen
stood
a
little
way
off
but
the
princess
said
nothing
to
giraldo
neither
refusing
his
love
nor
yet
saying
what
was
false
yet
she
suffered
him
to
talk
to
her
and
to
reach
up
his
hand
and
gently
touch
a
lock
of
hair
that
strayed
on
her
forehead
and
he
sighing
in
utter
happiness
and
contentment
closed
his
eyes
again
and
lay
back
very
quietly
on
the
couch
let
us
go
said
she
rising
i
will
send
a
physician
and
she
bade
one
of
the
gentlemen
lock
the
inner
room
and
give
her
the
key
and
she
and
the
king
and
they
all
then
departed
and
sent
his
servants
to
tend
giraldo
and
osra
caused
the
king
physician
also
to
be
summoned
but
giraldo
did
no
more
than
linger
some
few
days
alive
for
the
most
of
them
he
was
in
a
high
fever
his
brain
being
wild
and
he
raved
about
the
princess
sometimes
railing
at
her
sometimes
praising
her
yet
once
or
twice
he
awoke
calm
and
happy
as
he
had
been
when
she
knelt
by
him
and
having
for
his
only
delusion
the
thought
that
she
still
knelt
there
and
was
breathing
words
of
love
into
his
ear
and
in
this
last
merciful
error
in
respect
of
which
the
physicians
humoured
him
one
day
a
week
later
he
passed
away
and
was
at
peace
then
the
princess
came
attended
by
one
gentleman
in
whom
she
placed
confidence
and
she
destroyed
the
evil
picture
that
giraldo
had
painted
and
having
caused
a
fire
to
be
made
burnt
up
the
pieces
of
it
and
all
the
ruins
of
the
pictures
that
giraldo
had
destroyed
but
that
on
which
he
had
last
worked
so
happily
and
with
such
a
triumph
of
art
she
carried
with
her
to
the
palace
and
presently
she
caused
copies
to
be
made
of
it
and
sent
one
to
each
of
the
princes
by
whom
giraldo
had
been
commanded
to
paint
her
picture
and
with
it
the
money
he
had
received
the
whole
of
which
was
found
untouched
in
a
cabinet
in
his
house
but
the
picture
itself
she
hung
in
her
own
chamber
and
would
often
look
at
it
feeling
great
sorrow
for
the
fate
of
giraldo
the
painter
yet
king
rudolf
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
pity
the
young
man
saying
that
for
his
part
he
should
have
to
be
mad
before
the
love
of
a
woman
should
drive
him
mad
and
he
cursed
giraldo
for
an
insolent
knave
declaring
that
he
did
well
to
die
of
his
own
accord
and
because
de
m√©rosailles
had
gallantly
defended
his
sister
beauty
in
three
duels
he
sent
him
by
the
hand
of
a
high
officer
his
order
of
the
red
rose
which
de
m√©rosailles
wore
with
great
pride
at
the
court
of
versailles
but
when
the
copies
of
the
last
picture
reached
the
courts
to
which
they
were
addressed
together
with
the
money
and
a
brief
history
of
mad
doings
the
princes
turned
their
thoughts
again
to
the
matter
of
the
alliance
and
several
embassies
set
out
for
strelsau
so
that
princess
osra
said
with
a
smile
that
was
and
very
whimsical
i
am
much
troubled
by
reason
of
the
loss
of
signor
giraldo
my
painter
chapter
vii
the
indifference
of
the
miller
of
hofbau
there
is
a
swift
little
river
running
by
the
village
of
hofbau
and
on
the
river
is
a
mill
kept
in
the
days
of
king
rudolf
iii
by
a
sturdy
fellow
who
lived
there
all
alone
the
king
knew
him
having
alighted
at
his
house
for
a
draught
of
beer
as
he
rode
hunting
and
it
was
of
him
the
king
spoke
when
he
said
to
the
queen
there
is
i
believe
but
one
man
in
the
country
whom
osra
could
not
move
and
he
is
the
miller
of
hofbau
but
although
he
addressed
the
queen
it
was
his
sister
at
whom
he
aimed
his
speech
the
princess
herself
was
sitting
by
and
when
she
heard
the
king
she
said
in
truth
i
do
not
desire
to
move
any
man
what
but
trouble
comes
of
it
yet
who
is
this
miller
the
king
told
her
where
the
miller
might
be
found
and
he
added
if
you
convert
him
to
the
love
of
women
you
shall
have
the
finest
bracelet
in
strelsau
there
is
nothing
sire
so
remote
from
my
thoughts
or
desires
as
to
convert
your
miller
said
osra
scornfully
in
this
at
the
moment
she
spoke
truthfully
but
being
left
alone
for
some
days
at
the
castle
of
zenda
which
is
but
a
few
miles
from
hofbau
she
found
the
time
hang
very
heavy
on
her
hands
indeed
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
for
weariness
and
for
this
reason
and
none
other
at
all
one
day
she
ordered
her
horse
and
rode
off
with
a
single
groom
into
the
forest
coming
as
the
morning
went
on
to
a
wide
road
she
asked
the
groom
where
it
led
to
hofbau
madame
he
answered
it
is
not
more
than
a
mile
further
on
osra
waited
a
few
moments
then
she
said
i
will
ride
on
and
see
the
village
for
i
have
been
told
that
it
is
pretty
wait
here
till
i
return
and
she
rode
on
smiling
a
little
and
with
a
delicate
tint
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
before
long
she
saw
the
river
and
the
mill
on
the
river
and
coming
to
the
mill
she
saw
the
miller
sitting
before
his
door
smoking
a
long
pipe
she
called
out
to
him
asking
him
to
sell
her
a
glass
of
milk
you
can
have
it
for
the
asking
said
the
miller
he
was
a
fair
fellow
and
wore
a
scarlet
cap
there
is
a
pail
of
it
just
inside
the
door
behind
me
yet
he
did
not
rise
but
lay
there
lolling
luxuriously
in
the
sun
for
he
did
not
know
osra
never
having
been
to
strelsau
in
his
life
and
to
zenda
three
or
four
times
only
and
that
when
the
princess
was
not
there
moreover
though
this
as
must
be
allowed
is
not
to
the
purpose
he
had
sworn
never
again
to
go
so
far
afield
being
answered
in
this
manner
and
at
the
same
time
desiring
the
milk
the
princess
had
no
choice
but
to
dismount
this
she
did
and
passed
by
the
miller
pausing
a
moment
to
look
at
him
with
bright
curious
eyes
that
flashed
from
under
the
brim
of
her
feathered
hat
but
the
miller
blinked
lazily
up
at
the
sun
and
took
no
heed
of
her
osra
passed
on
found
the
pail
poured
out
a
cup
of
milk
and
drank
it
then
refilling
the
cup
she
carried
it
to
the
miller
will
you
not
have
some
said
she
with
a
smile
i
was
too
lazy
to
get
it
said
the
miller
and
he
held
out
his
hand
but
did
not
otherwise
change
his
position
osra
brow
puckered
and
her
cheek
flushed
as
she
bent
down
holding
the
cup
of
milk
so
that
the
miller
could
reach
it
he
took
and
drained
it
gave
it
back
to
her
and
put
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
again
osra
sat
down
by
him
and
watched
him
he
puffed
and
blinked
away
never
so
much
as
looking
at
her
illustration
he
took
it
and
drained
it
what
have
you
for
dinner
asked
she
presently
a
piece
of
cold
pie
said
he
there
enough
for
two
if
hungry
would
you
not
like
it
better
hot
oh
aye
but
i
can
not
weary
myself
with
heating
it
i
heat
it
said
the
princess
and
rising
she
went
into
the
house
and
made
up
the
fire
which
was
almost
burnt
out
then
she
heated
the
pie
and
set
the
room
in
order
and
laid
the
table
and
drew
a
large
jug
of
beer
from
the
cask
next
she
placed
an
ready
for
the
miller
and
put
the
jug
by
it
then
she
filled
the
pipe
from
the
bowl
of
tobacco
and
set
a
cushion
in
the
chair
all
this
while
she
hummed
a
tune
and
from
time
to
time
smiled
gayly
lastly
she
arranged
a
chair
by
the
elbow
of
the
miller
chair
then
she
went
out
and
told
him
that
his
dinner
was
ready
and
he
stumbled
to
his
feet
with
a
sigh
of
laziness
and
walked
before
her
into
the
house
may
i
come
cried
she
aye
there
is
enough
for
two
said
the
miller
of
hofbau
without
looking
round
so
she
followed
him
in
he
sank
into
the
and
sat
there
for
a
moment
surveying
the
room
which
was
so
neat
and
the
table
so
daintily
laid
and
the
pie
so
steaming
hot
and
he
sighed
saying
it
was
like
this
before
poor
mother
died
and
he
fell
to
on
a
great
portion
of
pie
with
which
osra
piled
his
plate
when
he
had
finished
eating
which
thing
did
not
happen
for
some
time
she
held
the
jug
while
he
took
a
long
draught
then
she
brought
a
coal
in
the
tongs
and
held
it
while
he
lit
his
pipe
from
it
then
she
sat
down
by
him
for
several
moments
he
puffed
and
then
at
last
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
princess
osra
she
drooped
her
long
lashes
and
cast
down
her
eyes
next
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
glanced
for
an
instant
at
the
miller
and
finally
she
dropped
her
eyes
again
and
murmured
shyly
what
is
it
sir
why
do
you
look
at
me
you
seem
to
be
a
handy
wench
observed
the
miller
the
pie
was
steaming
hot
and
yet
not
burnt
the
beer
was
well
frothed
but
not
shaken
nor
thickened
and
the
pipe
draws
well
where
does
your
father
dwell
he
is
dead
sir
said
princess
osra
very
demurely
and
your
mother
pursued
the
miller
she
also
is
dead
there
is
small
harm
in
that
said
the
miller
thoughtfully
and
osra
turned
away
her
head
to
hide
her
smile
are
you
not
very
lonely
living
here
all
by
yourself
she
asked
a
moment
later
indeed
i
have
to
do
everything
for
myself
said
the
miller
sadly
and
there
is
nobody
to
to
care
for
you
no
nor
to
look
after
my
comfort
said
the
miller
have
you
any
kindred
i
have
two
brothers
sir
but
they
are
married
now
and
have
no
need
of
me
the
miller
laid
down
his
pipe
and
setting
his
elbow
on
the
table
faced
princess
osra
h
said
he
and
is
it
likely
you
will
ride
this
way
again
i
may
chance
to
do
so
said
osra
and
now
there
was
a
glance
of
malicious
triumph
in
her
eyes
she
was
thinking
already
how
the
bracelet
would
look
on
her
arm
ah
said
the
miller
and
after
a
pause
he
added
if
you
do
come
half
an
hour
before
dinner
and
you
can
lend
a
hand
in
making
it
ready
where
did
you
get
those
fine
clothes
my
mistress
gave
them
to
me
answered
osra
she
has
cast
them
off
and
that
horse
you
rode
it
is
my
master
i
have
it
to
ride
when
i
do
my
mistress
errands
will
your
master
and
mistress
do
anything
for
you
if
you
leave
your
service
i
have
been
promised
a
present
if
said
osra
and
she
paused
in
apparent
confusion
aye
said
the
miller
nodding
sagaciously
as
he
rose
slowly
from
the
will
you
be
this
way
again
in
a
week
or
so
he
asked
i
think
it
is
very
likely
answered
the
princess
osra
then
look
in
said
the
miller
about
half
an
hour
before
dinner
he
nodded
his
head
again
very
significantly
at
osra
and
turning
away
went
to
his
work
as
a
man
goes
who
would
far
rather
sit
still
in
the
sun
but
just
as
he
reached
the
door
he
turned
his
head
and
asked
are
you
sturdy
i
am
strong
enough
i
think
said
she
a
sack
of
flour
is
a
heavy
thing
for
a
man
to
lift
by
himself
remarked
the
miller
and
with
that
he
passed
through
the
door
and
left
her
alone
then
she
cleared
the
table
put
the
pie
or
what
was
left
in
the
larder
set
the
room
in
order
refilled
the
pipe
stood
the
jug
handy
by
the
cask
and
with
a
look
of
great
satisfaction
on
her
face
tripped
out
to
where
her
horse
was
mounted
and
rode
away
the
next
week
and
the
interval
had
seemed
long
to
her
and
no
less
long
to
the
miller
of
hofbau
she
came
again
and
so
the
week
after
and
in
the
week
following
that
she
came
twice
and
on
the
second
of
these
two
days
after
dinner
the
miller
did
not
go
off
to
his
sacks
but
he
followed
her
out
of
the
house
pipe
in
hand
when
she
went
to
mount
her
horse
and
as
she
was
about
to
mount
he
said
indeed
you
a
handy
wench
you
say
much
of
my
hands
but
nothing
of
my
face
remarked
princess
osra
of
your
face
repeated
the
miller
in
some
surprise
what
should
i
say
of
your
face
well
is
it
not
a
comely
face
said
osra
turning
towards
him
that
he
might
be
better
able
to
answer
her
question
the
miller
regarded
her
for
some
minutes
then
a
slow
smile
spread
on
his
lips
oh
aye
it
is
well
enough
said
he
then
he
laid
a
floury
finger
on
her
arm
as
he
continued
if
you
come
next
week
why
it
is
but
half
a
mile
to
church
i
have
the
cart
ready
and
bid
the
priest
be
there
what
your
name
for
he
had
not
hitherto
asked
osra
name
rosa
schwartz
said
she
and
her
face
was
all
alight
with
triumph
and
amusement
yes
i
shall
be
very
comfortable
with
you
said
the
miller
we
will
be
at
the
church
an
hour
before
noon
so
that
there
may
be
time
afterwards
for
the
preparation
of
dinner
that
will
be
on
thursday
in
next
week
asked
osra
aye
on
thursday
said
the
miller
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
but
in
a
minute
he
turned
again
saying
give
me
a
kiss
then
since
we
are
to
be
man
and
wife
and
he
came
slowly
towards
her
holding
his
arms
open
nay
the
kiss
will
wait
till
thursday
maybe
there
will
be
less
flour
on
your
face
then
and
with
a
laugh
she
dived
under
his
outstretched
arms
and
made
her
escape
the
day
being
warm
the
miller
did
not
put
himself
out
by
pursuing
her
but
stood
where
he
was
with
a
broad
comfortable
smile
on
his
lips
and
so
he
watched
her
ride
away
now
as
she
rode
the
princess
was
much
occupied
in
thinking
of
the
miller
of
hofbau
elated
and
triumphant
as
she
was
at
having
won
from
him
a
promise
of
marriage
she
was
yet
somewhat
vexed
that
he
had
not
shown
a
more
passionate
affection
and
this
thought
clouded
her
brow
for
full
half
an
hour
but
then
her
face
cleared
still
waters
run
deep
she
said
to
herself
he
is
not
like
these
court
gallants
who
have
learnt
to
make
love
as
soon
as
they
learn
to
walk
and
can
not
talk
to
a
woman
without
bowing
and
grimacing
and
sighing
at
every
word
the
miller
has
a
deep
nature
and
surely
i
have
won
his
heart
or
he
would
not
take
me
for
his
wife
poor
miller
i
pray
that
he
may
not
grieve
very
bitterly
when
i
make
the
truth
known
to
him
and
then
at
the
thought
of
the
grief
of
the
miller
her
face
was
again
clouded
but
it
again
cleared
when
she
considered
of
the
great
triumph
that
she
had
won
and
how
she
would
enjoy
a
victory
over
the
king
and
would
have
the
finest
bracelet
in
all
strelsau
as
a
gift
from
him
thus
she
arrived
at
the
castle
in
the
height
of
merriment
and
exultation
it
chanced
that
the
king
came
to
zenda
that
night
to
spend
a
week
hunting
the
boar
in
the
forest
and
when
osra
all
blushing
and
laughing
told
him
of
her
success
with
the
miller
of
hofbau
he
was
greatly
amused
and
swore
that
no
such
girl
ever
lived
and
applauded
her
renewing
his
promise
of
the
bracelet
and
he
declared
that
he
would
himself
ride
with
her
to
hofbau
on
the
and
see
how
the
poor
miller
bore
his
disappointment
indeed
i
do
not
see
how
you
are
going
to
excuse
yourself
to
him
he
laughed
a
purse
of
five
hundred
crowns
must
do
that
office
for
me
said
she
what
will
crowns
patch
a
broken
heart
his
broken
heart
must
heal
itself
as
men
broken
hearts
do
brother
in
truth
sister
i
have
known
them
cure
themselves
let
us
hope
it
may
be
so
with
the
miller
of
hofbau
at
the
worst
i
have
revenged
the
wrongs
of
women
on
him
it
is
unendurable
that
any
man
should
scorn
us
be
he
king
or
miller
it
is
indeed
very
proper
that
he
should
suffer
great
pangs
said
the
king
in
spite
of
his
plaster
of
crowns
i
shall
love
to
see
the
stolid
fellow
sighing
and
moaning
like
a
lovesick
courtier
so
they
agreed
to
ride
together
to
the
miller
at
hofbau
on
the
day
appointed
for
the
wedding
and
both
of
them
waited
with
impatience
for
it
but
with
the
bad
luck
that
pursues
mortals
even
though
they
be
princes
in
this
poor
world
it
happened
that
early
in
the
morning
of
the
thursday
a
great
officer
came
riding
from
strelsau
to
take
the
king
commands
on
high
matters
of
state
and
although
rudolf
was
sorely
put
out
of
temper
by
this
untoward
interruption
yet
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
transact
the
business
before
he
rode
to
the
miller
at
hofbau
so
he
sat
fretting
and
fuming
while
long
papers
were
read
to
him
and
the
princess
walked
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
drawbridge
fretting
also
for
before
the
king
could
escape
from
his
affairs
the
hour
of
the
wedding
was
already
come
and
doubtless
the
miller
of
hofbau
was
waiting
with
the
priest
in
the
church
indeed
it
was
one
or
more
before
osra
and
the
king
set
out
from
zenda
and
they
had
then
a
ride
of
an
hour
and
a
half
and
all
this
when
osra
should
have
been
at
the
miller
at
eleven
poor
man
he
will
be
half
mad
with
waiting
and
with
anxiety
for
me
cried
osra
i
must
give
him
another
hundred
crowns
on
account
of
it
and
she
added
after
a
pause
i
pray
he
may
not
take
it
too
much
to
heart
rudolf
we
must
try
to
prevent
him
doing
himself
any
mischief
in
his
despair
smiled
the
king
indeed
it
is
a
serious
matter
pouted
the
princess
who
thought
the
king
smile
out
of
place
it
was
not
so
when
you
began
it
said
her
brother
and
osra
was
silent
then
about
two
they
came
in
sight
of
the
mill
now
the
king
dismounted
while
they
were
still
several
hundred
yards
away
and
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
in
a
clump
by
the
wayside
and
when
they
came
near
to
the
mill
he
made
a
circuit
and
approached
from
the
side
and
creeping
along
to
the
house
hid
himself
behind
a
large
which
stood
just
under
the
window
from
that
point
he
could
hear
what
passed
inside
the
house
and
could
see
if
he
stood
erect
but
osra
rode
up
to
the
front
of
the
mill
as
she
had
been
accustomed
and
getting
down
from
her
horse
walked
up
to
the
door
the
miller
cart
stood
in
the
yard
of
the
mill
but
the
horse
was
not
in
the
shafts
and
neither
the
miller
nor
anybody
else
was
to
be
seen
about
and
the
door
of
the
house
was
shut
he
must
be
waiting
at
the
church
said
she
but
i
will
look
in
and
make
sure
indeed
i
feel
half
afraid
to
meet
him
and
her
heart
was
beating
rapidly
and
her
face
was
rather
pale
as
she
walked
up
to
the
door
for
she
feared
what
the
miller
might
do
in
the
passion
of
his
disappointment
at
learning
who
she
was
and
that
she
could
not
be
his
wife
i
hope
the
six
hundred
crowns
will
comfort
him
she
said
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
and
she
sighed
her
heart
being
heavy
for
the
miller
and
maybe
a
little
heavy
also
for
the
guilt
that
lay
on
her
conscience
for
having
deceived
him
now
when
she
lifted
the
latch
and
opened
the
door
the
sight
that
met
her
eyes
was
this
the
table
was
strewn
with
the
remains
of
a
brave
dinner
two
pipes
lay
beside
the
plates
a
smaller
table
was
in
front
of
the
fire
on
it
stood
a
very
large
jug
entirely
empty
but
bearing
signs
of
having
been
full
not
so
long
ago
and
on
either
side
of
it
each
in
an
sat
the
priest
of
the
village
and
the
miller
of
hofbau
both
of
them
were
sleeping
very
contentedly
and
snoring
somewhat
as
they
slept
the
princess
smitten
by
remorse
at
the
spectacle
said
softly
illustration
on
either
side
of
it
sat
the
priest
of
the
village
and
the
miller
of
hofbau
poor
fellow
he
grew
weary
of
waiting
and
hungry
and
was
compelled
to
take
his
dinner
and
like
the
kind
man
he
is
he
has
entertained
the
priest
and
kept
him
here
so
that
no
time
should
be
lost
when
i
arrived
indeed
i
am
afraid
the
poor
man
loves
me
very
much
well
miller
or
lord
or
prince
they
are
all
the
same
why
did
i
deceive
him
and
she
walked
up
to
the
miller
chair
leant
over
the
back
of
it
and
lightly
touched
his
red
cap
with
her
fingers
he
put
up
his
hand
and
brushed
with
it
as
though
he
brushed
away
a
fly
but
gave
no
other
sign
of
awakening
the
king
called
softly
from
behind
the
under
the
window
is
he
there
osra
is
he
there
the
poor
man
has
fallen
asleep
in
weariness
she
answered
but
the
priest
is
here
ready
to
marry
us
oh
rudolf
i
am
so
sorry
for
what
i
have
done
girls
are
always
mighty
sorry
after
it
is
done
remarked
the
king
wake
him
up
osra
at
this
moment
the
miller
of
hofbau
sat
up
in
his
chair
and
gave
a
great
sneeze
and
by
this
sound
the
priest
also
was
awakened
osra
came
forward
and
stood
between
them
the
miller
looked
at
her
and
tilted
his
red
cap
forward
in
order
that
he
might
scratch
his
head
then
he
looked
across
to
the
priest
and
said
it
is
she
father
she
has
come
the
priest
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
smiled
uncomfortably
we
waited
two
hours
said
he
glancing
at
the
clock
see
it
is
three
now
i
am
sorry
you
waited
so
long
said
osra
but
i
could
not
come
before
and
and
now
that
i
am
come
i
can
not
but
here
she
paused
in
great
distress
and
confusion
not
knowing
how
to
break
her
sad
tidings
to
the
miller
of
hofbau
the
miller
drew
his
legs
up
under
his
chair
and
regarded
osra
with
a
grave
air
you
should
have
been
here
at
eleven
said
he
i
went
to
the
church
at
eleven
and
the
priest
was
there
and
my
cousin
hans
to
act
as
my
groom
and
my
cousin
gertrude
to
be
your
maid
there
we
waited
hard
on
two
hours
but
you
did
not
come
i
am
very
sorry
pleaded
princess
osra
the
king
laughed
low
to
himself
behind
the
being
much
amused
at
her
distress
and
her
humility
and
now
that
you
are
come
pursued
the
miller
scratching
his
head
again
i
do
not
know
what
we
are
to
do
he
looked
again
at
the
priest
seeking
counsel
at
this
the
princess
osra
thinking
that
an
opportunity
had
come
took
the
purse
of
six
hundred
crowns
from
under
her
cloak
and
laid
it
on
the
table
what
is
this
said
the
miller
for
the
first
time
showing
some
eagerness
they
are
for
you
said
osra
as
she
watched
him
while
he
unfastened
the
purse
then
he
poured
the
crowns
out
on
the
table
and
counted
them
one
by
one
till
he
had
told
all
the
six
hundred
then
he
raised
his
hands
above
his
head
let
them
fall
again
sighed
slightly
and
looked
across
at
the
priest
i
warned
you
not
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
friend
miller
remarked
the
priest
i
waited
two
hours
said
the
miller
plaintively
and
you
know
that
she
is
a
handy
wench
and
very
fond
of
me
he
began
to
gather
up
the
crowns
and
return
them
to
the
purse
i
trust
i
am
a
handy
wench
said
osra
smiling
yet
still
very
nervous
and
indeed
i
have
a
great
regard
for
the
miller
but
nay
he
does
not
mean
you
interrupted
the
priest
six
hundred
sighed
the
miller
and
gertrude
has
but
two
hundred
still
she
is
a
handy
wench
and
very
sturdy
i
doubt
if
you
could
lift
a
sack
by
yourself
as
she
can
and
he
looked
doubtfully
at
slender
figure
i
do
not
know
why
you
talk
of
gertrude
said
the
princess
petulantly
what
is
gertrude
to
me
why
i
take
it
that
she
is
nothing
at
all
to
you
answered
the
priest
folding
his
hands
on
his
lap
and
smiling
placidly
still
for
my
part
i
bade
him
wait
a
little
longer
i
waited
two
hours
said
the
miller
and
gertrude
urged
me
saying
that
you
would
not
come
and
that
she
would
look
after
me
better
than
you
being
one
of
the
family
and
she
said
it
was
hard
that
she
should
have
no
husband
while
her
own
cousin
married
a
stranger
and
since
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
provided
i
got
a
handy
and
sturdy
wench
what
cried
the
princess
osra
and
the
king
was
so
interested
that
he
rose
up
from
behind
the
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
looked
in
and
saw
all
that
happened
it
being
pursued
the
miller
of
hofbau
all
the
same
to
me
so
that
i
got
what
i
wanted
why
when
you
did
not
come
he
married
his
cousin
said
the
priest
a
sudden
roar
of
laughter
came
from
the
window
all
three
turned
round
but
the
king
ducked
his
head
and
crouched
again
behind
the
before
they
saw
him
who
was
that
cried
the
priest
a
lad
that
came
to
hold
my
horse
answered
osra
hastily
and
then
she
turned
fiercely
on
the
miller
and
that
she
said
was
all
you
wanted
i
thought
you
loved
me
aye
i
liked
you
very
well
said
the
miller
you
are
a
handy
a
stamp
of
her
foot
drowned
the
rest
but
you
should
have
come
in
time
he
went
on
and
this
gertrude
is
she
pretty
demanded
osra
gertrude
is
well
enough
said
the
miller
but
she
has
only
two
hundred
crowns
and
he
put
the
purse
now
full
again
on
the
table
with
a
resigned
sigh
and
you
shall
have
no
more
cried
osra
snatching
up
her
purse
in
great
rage
and
you
and
gertrude
may
what
of
gertrude
came
at
this
moment
from
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
sacks
were
the
princess
turned
round
swift
as
the
wind
and
she
saw
in
the
doorway
a
short
and
very
broad
girl
with
a
very
wide
face
and
straggling
hair
the
girl
nose
was
very
flat
and
her
eyes
were
small
but
her
great
mouth
smiled
and
as
the
princess
looked
she
let
slip
to
the
ground
a
sack
of
flour
that
she
had
been
carrying
on
her
sturdy
back
aye
gertrude
is
well
enough
said
the
miller
looking
at
her
contentedly
she
is
very
strong
and
willing
then
while
gertrude
stood
wondering
and
staring
with
wide
eyes
in
the
doorway
the
princess
swept
up
to
the
miller
and
leant
over
him
and
cried
look
at
my
face
look
at
my
face
what
manner
of
face
is
it
it
is
well
enough
said
the
miller
but
gertrude
is
there
was
a
crash
on
the
floor
and
the
six
hundred
crowns
rolled
out
of
the
purse
and
scattered
spinning
and
rolling
hither
and
thither
all
over
the
floor
and
into
every
corner
of
the
room
and
princess
osra
cried
have
you
no
eyes
and
then
she
turned
away
for
her
lip
was
quivering
and
she
would
not
have
the
miller
see
it
but
she
turned
from
the
miller
only
to
face
gertrude
his
wife
gertrude
small
eyes
brightened
with
sudden
intelligence
ah
you
the
other
girl
said
gertrude
with
much
amusement
and
was
that
your
dowry
it
is
large
i
am
glad
you
did
not
come
in
time
but
see
i
pick
it
up
for
you
nay
do
take
on
i
dare
say
you
find
another
husband
she
passed
by
osra
patting
her
on
the
shoulder
kindly
as
she
went
and
then
fell
on
her
knees
and
began
to
pick
up
the
crowns
crawling
after
them
all
over
the
floor
and
holding
up
her
apron
to
receive
the
recovered
treasure
and
princess
osra
stood
looking
at
her
aye
you
find
another
husband
nodded
the
priest
encouragingly
aye
you
find
another
husband
assented
the
miller
placidly
and
just
as
one
girl
is
pretty
nearly
as
good
as
another
if
she
is
handy
and
sturdy
so
one
husband
is
as
good
as
another
if
he
can
keep
a
house
over
you
princess
osra
said
nothing
but
gertrude
having
picked
up
the
crowns
came
to
her
with
a
full
apron
saying
hold
your
lap
and
i
pour
them
in
they
get
you
a
good
husband
princess
osra
suddenly
bent
and
kissed
gertrude
cheek
and
she
said
gently
i
hope
you
have
got
a
good
husband
my
dear
but
let
him
do
some
work
for
himself
and
keep
the
six
hundred
crowns
as
a
present
from
me
for
he
will
value
you
more
with
eight
hundred
than
with
two
the
eyes
of
all
three
were
fixed
on
her
in
wonder
and
almost
in
fear
for
her
tone
and
manner
were
now
different
then
she
turned
to
the
miller
and
she
bit
her
lip
and
dashed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
and
she
said
and
you
miller
are
the
only
sensible
man
i
have
found
in
all
the
kingdom
therefore
good
luck
and
a
good
wife
to
you
and
she
gave
a
little
short
laugh
and
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
cottage
leaving
them
all
spellbound
in
wonder
but
the
miller
rose
from
his
chair
and
ran
to
the
door
and
when
he
reached
it
the
king
was
just
lifting
osra
on
to
her
horse
the
miller
knew
the
king
and
stood
there
with
eyes
wide
and
cheeks
bulged
in
wonder
but
he
could
gasp
out
no
more
than
the
king
the
king
before
rudolf
and
osra
were
far
away
and
they
could
none
of
them
neither
the
miller
nor
gertrude
nor
the
priest
tell
what
the
matter
meant
until
one
day
king
rudolf
rode
again
to
the
mill
at
hofbau
and
having
sent
for
the
priest
told
the
three
enough
of
the
truth
saying
that
the
affair
was
the
outcome
of
a
jest
at
court
and
he
made
each
of
them
a
handsome
present
and
vowed
them
to
secrecy
by
their
fealty
and
attachment
to
his
person
and
his
honour
so
she
would
not
have
married
me
anyhow
asked
the
miller
i
think
not
friend
answered
rudolf
with
a
laugh
then
we
are
but
quits
and
all
is
well
gertrude
the
jug
my
lass
and
so
indeed
it
seemed
to
the
king
that
they
were
but
quits
and
so
he
said
to
the
princess
osra
but
he
declared
that
she
had
so
far
prevailed
with
the
miller
as
to
make
him
desire
marriage
as
an
excellent
and
useful
thing
in
itself
although
she
had
not
persuaded
him
that
it
was
of
great
moment
whom
a
man
married
therefore
he
was
very
anxious
to
give
her
the
bracelet
which
he
had
promised
and
more
than
once
prayed
her
to
accept
it
but
osra
saw
the
laugh
that
lurked
in
the
king
eye
and
would
not
consent
to
have
the
bracelet
and
for
a
long
while
she
did
not
love
to
speak
of
the
miller
of
hofbau
yet
once
when
the
king
on
some
occasion
cried
out
very
impatiently
that
all
men
were
fools
she
said
sire
you
forget
the
miller
of
hofbau
and
she
blushed
and
laughed
and
turned
her
eyes
away
one
other
thing
she
did
which
very
greatly
puzzled
queen
margaret
and
all
the
ladies
of
the
court
and
all
the
and
all
the
and
in
fine
every
person
high
or
low
who
saw
or
heard
of
it
except
the
king
only
for
in
winter
evenings
she
took
her
scissors
and
her
needle
and
she
cut
strips
of
ribbon
each
a
foot
long
and
a
couple
of
inches
broad
on
each
of
them
she
embroidered
a
motto
or
legend
and
she
affixed
the
ribbons
bearing
the
legend
to
each
and
every
one
of
the
mirrors
in
each
of
her
chambers
at
strelsau
at
zenda
and
at
the
other
royal
residences
and
her
noticed
that
whenever
she
had
looked
in
the
mirror
and
smiled
at
her
own
image
or
shewn
other
signs
of
pleasure
in
it
she
would
then
cast
her
eyes
up
to
the
legend
and
seem
to
read
it
and
blush
a
little
and
laugh
a
little
and
sigh
a
little
the
reason
for
which
things
they
could
by
no
means
understand
for
the
legend
was
but
this
the
miller
of
chapter
viii
the
love
of
the
prince
of
glottenberg
it
was
the
spring
of
the
year
when
ludwig
prince
of
glottenberg
came
courting
the
princess
osra
for
his
father
had
sought
the
most
beautiful
lady
of
a
royal
house
in
europe
and
had
found
none
equal
to
osra
therefore
the
prince
came
to
strelsau
with
a
great
retinue
and
was
lodged
in
the
white
palace
which
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
where
the
public
gardens
now
are
for
the
palace
itself
was
sacked
and
burnt
by
the
people
in
the
rising
of
here
ludwig
stayed
many
days
coming
every
day
to
the
king
palace
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
king
and
queen
and
to
make
his
court
to
the
princess
king
rudolf
had
received
him
with
the
utmost
friendship
and
was
for
reasons
of
state
then
of
great
moment
but
now
of
vanished
interest
as
eager
for
the
match
as
was
the
king
of
glottenberg
himself
and
he
grew
very
impatient
with
his
sister
when
she
hesitated
to
accept
ludwig
hand
alleging
that
she
felt
for
him
no
more
than
a
kindly
esteem
and
what
was
as
much
to
the
purpose
that
he
felt
no
more
for
her
for
although
the
prince
possessed
most
courteous
and
winning
manners
and
was
very
accomplished
both
in
learning
and
in
exercises
yet
he
was
a
grave
and
pensive
young
man
rather
stately
than
jovial
and
seemed
in
the
princess
eyes
accustomed
as
they
were
to
catch
and
check
ardent
glances
to
perform
his
wooing
more
as
a
duty
of
his
station
than
on
the
impulse
of
any
passion
finding
in
herself
also
no
such
sweet
ashamed
emotions
as
had
before
now
invaded
her
heart
on
account
of
lesser
men
she
grew
grave
and
troubled
at
last
she
said
to
the
king
brother
is
this
love
for
i
had
as
lief
he
were
away
as
here
and
when
he
is
here
he
kisses
my
hand
as
though
it
were
a
statue
hand
and
and
i
feel
as
though
it
were
they
say
you
know
what
love
is
is
this
love
there
are
many
forms
of
love
smiled
the
king
this
is
such
love
as
a
prince
and
a
princess
may
most
properly
feel
i
do
not
call
it
love
at
all
said
osra
with
a
pout
when
prince
ludwig
came
next
day
to
see
her
and
told
her
with
grave
courtesy
that
his
pleasure
lay
in
doing
her
will
she
broke
out
i
had
rather
it
lay
in
watching
my
face
and
then
ashamed
she
turned
away
from
him
he
seemed
grieved
and
hurt
at
her
words
it
was
with
a
sigh
that
he
said
my
life
shall
be
spent
in
giving
you
joy
she
turned
round
on
him
with
flushed
cheek
and
trembling
lips
yes
but
i
had
rather
it
were
spent
in
getting
joy
from
me
he
cast
down
his
eyes
a
moment
and
then
taking
her
hand
kissed
it
but
she
drew
it
away
sharply
so
that
afternoon
they
parted
he
back
to
his
palace
she
to
her
chamber
where
she
sat
asking
again
is
this
love
and
crying
he
does
not
know
love
and
pausing
now
and
again
before
her
mirror
to
ask
her
pictured
face
why
it
would
not
unlock
the
door
of
love
on
another
day
she
would
be
merry
or
feign
merriment
rallying
him
on
his
sombre
air
and
formal
compliments
professing
that
for
her
part
she
soon
grew
weary
of
such
wooing
and
loved
to
be
easy
and
merry
for
thus
she
hoped
to
sting
him
so
that
he
would
either
disclose
more
warmth
or
altogether
forsake
his
pursuit
but
he
offered
many
apologies
blaming
nature
that
had
made
him
grave
but
assuring
her
of
his
deep
affection
and
respect
affection
and
respect
murmured
osra
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
oh
that
i
had
not
been
born
a
princess
and
yet
though
she
did
not
love
him
she
thought
him
a
very
noble
gentleman
and
trusted
to
his
honour
and
sincerity
in
everything
therefore
when
he
still
persisted
and
rudolf
and
the
queen
urged
her
telling
her
the
king
mockingly
the
queen
with
a
touch
of
sadness
that
she
must
not
look
to
find
in
the
world
such
love
as
romantic
girls
dreamt
of
at
last
she
yielded
she
told
her
brother
that
she
would
marry
prince
ludwig
yet
for
a
little
while
she
would
not
have
the
news
proclaimed
so
rudolf
went
alone
and
privately
to
the
white
palace
and
said
to
ludwig
cousin
you
have
won
the
fairest
lady
in
the
world
behold
her
brother
says
it
prince
ludwig
bowed
low
and
taking
the
king
hand
pressed
it
thanking
him
for
his
help
and
approval
and
expressing
himself
as
most
grateful
for
the
boon
of
the
princess
favour
will
you
not
come
with
me
and
find
her
cried
the
king
with
a
merry
look
i
have
urgent
business
now
answered
ludwig
beg
the
princess
to
forgive
me
this
afternoon
i
will
crave
the
honour
of
waiting
on
her
with
my
humble
gratitude
king
rudolf
looked
at
him
a
smile
curling
on
his
lips
and
he
said
in
one
of
his
gusts
of
impatience
by
heaven
is
there
another
man
in
the
world
who
would
talk
about
gratitude
and
business
and
the
afternoon
when
osra
of
strelsau
sat
waiting
for
him
i
mean
no
discourtesy
protested
ludwig
taking
the
king
arm
and
glancing
at
him
with
most
friendly
eyes
indeed
dear
friend
i
am
rejoiced
and
honoured
but
this
business
of
mine
will
not
wait
so
the
king
frowning
and
grumbling
and
laughing
went
back
alone
and
told
the
princess
that
the
happy
wooer
was
most
grateful
and
would
come
after
his
business
was
transacted
that
afternoon
but
osra
having
given
her
hand
would
admit
no
fault
in
the
man
she
had
chosen
and
thanked
the
king
for
the
message
with
great
dignity
then
the
king
came
to
her
and
sitting
down
by
her
stroked
her
hair
saying
softly
you
have
had
many
lovers
sister
osra
and
now
comes
a
husband
yes
now
a
husband
she
murmured
catching
swiftly
at
his
hand
her
voice
was
half
caught
in
a
sudden
sob
so
goes
the
world
our
world
said
the
king
knitting
his
brows
and
seeming
to
fall
for
a
moment
into
a
sad
reverie
i
am
frightened
she
whispered
should
i
be
frightened
if
i
loved
him
i
have
been
told
so
said
the
king
smiling
again
but
the
fear
has
a
way
of
being
mastered
then
and
he
drew
her
to
him
and
gave
her
a
hearty
brother
kiss
telling
her
to
take
courage
you
thaw
the
fellow
yet
said
the
king
though
i
grant
you
he
is
icy
enough
for
the
king
himself
had
been
by
no
means
what
he
called
an
icy
man
but
osra
was
not
satisfied
and
sought
to
assuage
the
pain
of
her
heart
by
adorning
herself
most
carefully
for
the
prince
coming
hoping
to
fire
him
to
love
for
she
thought
that
if
he
loved
she
might
although
since
he
did
not
she
could
not
and
surely
he
did
not
or
all
the
tales
of
love
were
false
thus
she
came
to
receive
him
very
magnificently
arrayed
there
was
a
flush
on
her
cheek
and
an
uncertain
expectant
fearful
look
in
her
eyes
thus
she
stood
before
him
as
he
fell
on
his
knee
and
kissed
her
hand
then
he
rose
and
declared
his
thanks
and
promised
his
devotion
but
as
he
spoke
the
flush
faded
and
the
light
died
from
her
eyes
and
when
at
last
he
drew
near
to
her
and
offered
to
kiss
her
cheek
her
eyes
were
dead
and
her
face
pale
and
cold
as
she
suffered
him
to
touch
it
he
was
content
to
touch
it
but
once
and
seemed
not
to
know
how
cold
it
was
and
so
after
more
talk
of
his
father
pleasure
and
his
pride
he
took
his
leave
promising
to
come
again
the
next
day
she
ran
to
the
window
when
the
door
was
closed
on
him
and
thence
watched
him
mount
his
horse
and
ride
away
slowly
with
his
head
bent
and
his
eyes
downcast
yet
he
was
a
noble
gentleman
stately
and
handsome
kind
and
true
the
tears
came
suddenly
into
her
eyes
and
blurred
her
sight
as
she
leant
watching
from
behind
the
hanging
curtains
of
the
window
though
she
dashed
them
away
angrily
they
came
again
and
ran
down
her
pale
cold
cheeks
mourning
the
golden
vision
that
seemed
gone
without
fulfilment
that
evening
there
came
a
gentleman
from
the
prince
of
glottenberg
carrying
most
humble
excuses
from
his
master
who
so
he
said
was
prevented
from
waiting
on
the
princess
the
next
day
by
a
certain
very
urgent
affair
which
took
him
from
strelsau
and
would
keep
him
absent
from
the
city
all
day
long
and
the
gentleman
delivered
to
osra
a
letter
from
the
prince
full
of
graceful
and
profound
apologies
and
pleading
an
engagement
that
his
honour
would
not
let
him
break
for
nothing
short
of
that
said
he
should
have
kept
him
from
her
side
there
followed
some
lover
phrases
scantily
worded
and
frigid
in
an
assumed
passion
but
osra
smiling
graciously
sent
back
a
message
readily
accepting
all
that
the
prince
urged
in
excuse
and
she
told
what
had
passed
to
the
king
with
her
head
high
in
the
air
and
a
careless
haughtiness
so
that
even
the
king
did
not
rally
her
nor
yet
venture
to
comfort
her
but
urged
her
to
spend
the
day
in
riding
with
the
queen
and
him
for
they
were
setting
out
for
zenda
where
the
king
was
to
hunt
in
the
forest
and
she
could
ride
some
part
of
the
way
with
them
and
return
in
the
evening
and
she
wishing
that
she
had
sent
first
to
the
prince
to
bid
him
not
come
agreed
to
go
with
her
brother
it
was
better
far
to
go
than
to
wait
at
home
for
a
lover
who
would
not
come
thus
the
next
morning
they
rode
out
the
king
and
queen
with
their
retinue
the
princess
attended
by
one
of
her
guard
named
christian
hantz
who
was
greatly
attached
to
her
and
most
jealous
in
praise
and
admiration
of
her
this
fellow
had
taken
it
on
himself
to
be
very
angry
with
prince
ludwig
coldness
but
dared
say
nothing
of
it
yet
impelled
by
his
anger
he
had
set
himself
to
watch
the
prince
very
closely
and
thus
he
had
as
he
conceived
discovered
something
which
brought
a
twinkle
into
his
eye
and
a
triumphant
smile
to
his
lips
as
he
rode
behind
the
princess
some
fifteen
miles
she
accompanied
her
brother
and
then
turning
with
christian
took
another
way
back
to
the
city
alone
she
rode
her
mind
full
of
sad
thoughts
while
christian
behind
still
wore
his
malicious
smile
but
presently
although
she
had
not
commanded
him
he
quickened
his
pace
and
came
up
to
her
side
relying
for
excuse
on
the
favour
which
she
always
shewed
him
well
christian
said
she
have
you
something
to
say
to
me
for
answer
he
pointed
to
a
small
house
standing
among
the
trees
some
way
from
the
road
and
he
said
if
i
were
ludwig
and
not
christian
yet
i
would
be
here
where
christian
is
and
not
there
where
ludwig
is
and
he
pointed
still
at
the
house
she
faced
round
in
anger
at
his
daring
to
speak
to
her
of
the
prince
but
he
was
a
bold
fellow
and
would
not
be
silenced
now
that
he
had
begun
to
speak
he
knew
also
that
she
would
bear
much
from
him
so
he
leant
over
towards
her
saying
by
your
bounty
madame
i
have
money
and
he
who
has
money
can
get
knowledge
so
i
know
that
the
prince
is
there
for
fifty
crowns
i
gained
a
servant
of
his
and
he
told
me
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
spy
on
the
prince
said
osra
and
i
do
not
care
to
know
where
the
prince
is
and
she
touched
her
horse
with
the
spur
and
cantered
forward
fast
leaving
the
little
house
behind
but
christian
persisted
partly
in
a
foolish
grudge
against
any
man
who
should
win
what
was
above
his
reach
partly
in
an
honest
anger
that
she
whom
he
worshipped
should
be
treated
lightly
by
another
and
he
forced
her
to
hear
what
he
had
learnt
from
the
gossip
of
the
prince
groom
telling
it
to
her
in
hints
and
sentences
yet
so
plainly
that
she
could
not
miss
the
gist
of
it
she
rode
the
faster
towards
strelsau
at
first
answering
nothing
but
at
last
she
turned
on
him
fiercely
saying
that
he
told
a
lie
and
that
she
knew
it
was
a
lie
since
she
knew
where
the
prince
was
and
what
business
had
taken
him
away
and
she
commanded
christian
to
be
silent
and
to
speak
neither
to
her
nor
to
any
one
else
of
his
false
suspicions
and
she
bade
him
very
harshly
to
fall
back
and
ride
behind
her
again
which
he
did
sullen
yet
satisfied
for
he
knew
that
his
arrow
had
gone
home
on
she
rode
with
her
cheeks
aflame
and
her
heart
beating
until
she
came
to
strelsau
having
arrived
at
the
palace
she
ran
to
her
own
bedroom
and
flung
herself
on
the
bed
here
for
an
hour
she
lay
then
it
being
about
six
she
sat
up
pushing
her
disordered
hair
back
from
her
hot
aching
brow
an
agony
of
humiliation
had
come
upon
her
and
a
fury
of
resentment
against
the
prince
whose
coldness
seemed
now
to
need
no
more
explanation
yet
she
could
hardly
believe
what
she
had
been
told
of
him
for
though
she
had
not
loved
him
she
had
accorded
to
him
her
full
trust
rising
she
paced
in
pain
about
the
room
she
could
not
rest
she
cried
out
in
longing
that
her
brother
were
there
to
aid
her
and
find
out
the
truth
for
her
but
he
was
away
and
she
had
none
to
whom
she
could
turn
so
she
strove
to
master
her
anger
and
endure
her
suspense
till
the
next
day
but
they
were
too
strong
for
her
and
she
cried
i
will
go
myself
i
can
not
sleep
till
i
know
but
i
can
not
go
alone
who
will
go
with
me
but
she
knew
of
none
for
she
would
not
take
christian
with
her
and
she
shrank
from
speaking
of
the
matter
to
any
gentlemen
of
the
court
yet
she
must
know
at
last
she
sprang
from
the
chair
into
which
she
had
sunk
despondent
exclaiming
he
is
a
gentleman
and
my
friend
he
will
go
with
me
and
she
sent
hastily
for
the
bishop
of
modenstein
who
was
then
in
strelsau
bidding
him
come
dressed
for
riding
with
a
sword
and
on
the
best
horse
in
his
stables
the
bishop
came
equipped
as
she
bade
him
and
in
very
great
wonder
but
when
she
told
what
she
wanted
and
what
christian
had
made
known
to
her
he
grew
grave
saying
that
they
must
wait
and
consult
the
king
when
he
returned
i
will
not
wait
an
hour
she
cried
i
can
not
wait
an
hour
then
i
will
ride
and
bring
you
word
you
must
not
go
he
urged
nay
if
i
go
alone
i
will
go
said
she
yes
i
will
go
and
myself
fling
his
falseness
in
his
teeth
finding
her
thus
resolved
the
bishop
knew
that
he
could
not
turn
her
so
leaving
her
to
prepare
herself
he
caught
christian
hantz
and
charged
him
to
bring
their
horses
to
the
most
private
gate
of
the
palace
which
opened
on
a
little
here
christian
waited
for
them
with
the
horses
and
they
came
presently
the
bishop
wearing
a
great
slouched
hat
and
swaggering
like
a
roystering
trooper
while
osra
was
closely
veiled
the
bishop
again
imposed
secrecy
on
christian
and
then
they
both
being
mounted
said
to
osra
if
you
will
then
madame
come
and
thus
they
rode
secretly
out
of
the
city
about
seven
in
the
evening
the
opening
the
gate
at
sight
of
the
royal
arms
on
osra
ring
which
she
gave
to
the
bishop
in
order
that
he
might
shew
it
in
silence
they
rode
a
long
way
going
at
a
great
speed
osra
face
was
set
and
rigid
for
she
felt
now
no
shame
at
herself
for
going
nor
any
fear
of
what
she
might
find
but
the
injury
to
her
pride
swallowed
every
other
feeling
and
at
last
she
said
in
short
sharp
words
to
the
bishop
of
modenstein
having
suddenly
thrown
the
veil
back
from
her
face
he
shall
not
live
if
it
prove
true
the
bishop
shook
his
head
his
profession
was
peace
yet
his
blood
also
was
hot
against
the
man
who
had
put
a
slight
on
princess
osra
the
king
must
know
of
it
he
said
the
king
the
king
is
not
here
said
osra
and
she
pricked
her
horse
and
set
him
at
a
gallop
the
moon
breaking
suddenly
in
brightness
from
behind
a
cloud
shewed
the
bishop
her
face
then
she
put
out
her
hand
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
whispering
are
you
my
friend
yes
madame
said
he
she
knew
well
that
he
was
her
friend
kill
him
for
me
then
kill
him
for
me
i
can
not
kill
him
said
the
bishop
i
pray
god
it
may
prove
untrue
you
are
not
my
friend
if
you
will
not
kill
him
said
osra
and
she
turned
her
face
away
and
rode
yet
more
quickly
at
last
they
came
in
sight
of
the
little
house
standing
back
from
the
road
and
there
was
a
light
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
the
bishop
heard
a
short
gasp
break
from
osra
lips
as
she
pointed
with
her
whip
to
the
window
now
his
own
breath
came
quick
and
fast
he
prayed
to
god
that
he
might
remember
his
sacred
character
and
his
vows
and
not
be
led
into
great
and
deadly
sin
at
the
bidding
of
that
proud
and
bitter
face
and
he
clenched
his
left
hand
and
struck
his
brow
with
it
thus
then
they
came
to
the
gate
of
the
avenue
of
trees
that
led
to
the
house
here
having
dismounted
and
tied
their
horses
to
the
they
stood
for
an
instant
and
osra
again
veiled
her
face
let
me
go
alone
madame
he
implored
give
me
your
sword
and
i
will
go
alone
she
answered
here
then
is
the
path
said
the
bishop
and
he
led
the
way
by
the
moonlight
that
broke
fitfully
here
and
there
through
the
trees
he
swore
that
all
his
life
should
be
mine
she
whispered
yet
i
knew
that
he
did
not
love
me
the
bishop
made
her
no
answer
she
looked
for
none
and
did
not
know
that
she
spoke
the
bitterness
of
her
heart
in
words
which
he
could
hear
he
bowed
his
head
and
prayed
again
for
her
and
for
himself
for
he
had
found
his
hand
gripping
the
hilt
of
his
sword
thus
side
by
side
now
they
came
to
the
door
of
the
house
and
saw
a
gentleman
standing
in
front
of
the
door
still
but
watchful
osra
knew
that
he
was
the
prince
chamberlain
when
the
chamberlain
saw
them
he
started
violently
and
clapped
a
hand
to
his
sword
but
osra
flung
her
veil
on
to
the
ground
and
the
bishop
gripped
his
arm
as
with
a
vice
the
chamberlain
looked
at
osra
and
at
the
bishop
and
half
drew
his
sword
this
matter
is
too
great
for
you
sir
said
the
bishop
it
is
a
quarrel
of
princes
stand
aside
and
before
the
chamberlain
could
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
osra
had
passed
by
him
and
the
bishop
had
followed
her
finding
themselves
in
a
narrow
passage
they
made
out
by
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
a
flight
of
stairs
that
rose
from
the
furthest
end
of
it
the
bishop
tried
to
pass
the
princess
but
she
motioned
him
back
and
walked
swiftly
to
the
stairs
in
silence
they
mounted
till
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
first
stage
and
facing
them
eight
or
ten
steps
further
up
was
a
door
by
the
door
stood
a
groom
this
was
the
man
who
had
treacherously
told
christian
of
his
master
doings
but
when
he
saw
suddenly
what
had
come
of
his
disloyal
chattering
the
fellow
turned
white
as
a
ghost
and
came
tottering
in
stealthy
silence
down
the
stairs
his
finger
on
his
lips
neither
of
them
spoke
to
him
nor
he
to
them
they
gave
no
thought
to
him
his
only
thought
was
to
escape
as
soon
as
he
might
so
he
passed
them
and
going
on
passed
also
the
chamberlain
who
stood
dazed
at
the
and
so
disappeared
intent
on
saving
the
life
he
had
justly
forfeited
thus
the
rogue
vanished
and
what
became
of
him
none
knew
or
cared
he
showed
his
face
no
more
at
glottenberg
or
strelsau
hark
there
are
voices
whispered
osra
to
the
bishop
raising
her
hand
above
her
head
as
they
two
stood
listening
the
voices
came
from
the
door
that
faced
them
the
voice
of
a
man
and
the
voice
of
a
woman
osra
glance
at
her
companion
told
him
that
she
knew
as
well
as
he
whose
the
man
voice
was
it
is
true
then
she
breathed
from
between
her
teeth
my
god
it
is
true
the
woman
voice
spoke
now
but
the
words
were
not
audible
then
came
the
prince
for
ever
in
life
or
death
apart
or
together
for
ever
the
woman
answer
came
no
more
in
words
but
in
deep
low
passionate
sobs
which
struck
their
ears
like
the
distant
cry
of
some
brute
creature
in
pain
that
it
can
not
understand
yet
osra
face
was
stern
and
cold
and
her
lips
curled
scornfully
when
she
saw
the
bishop
look
of
pity
come
let
us
end
it
said
she
and
with
a
firm
step
she
began
to
mount
the
stairs
that
lay
between
them
and
the
door
yet
once
again
they
paused
outside
the
door
for
it
seemed
as
though
the
princess
could
not
choose
but
listen
to
the
passionate
words
of
love
that
pierced
her
ears
like
knives
yet
they
were
all
sad
speaking
of
renunciation
not
of
happiness
but
at
last
she
heard
her
own
name
then
with
a
sudden
start
she
caught
the
bishop
hand
for
she
could
not
listen
longer
she
staggered
and
reeled
as
she
whispered
to
him
the
door
the
door
open
the
door
the
bishop
his
right
hand
being
across
his
body
and
resting
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
laid
his
left
upon
the
handle
of
the
door
and
turned
it
then
he
flung
the
door
open
wide
at
that
instant
osra
sprang
past
him
her
eyes
gleaming
like
flames
from
her
dead
white
face
and
she
stood
rigid
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
with
the
bishop
by
her
side
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
the
prince
of
glottenberg
strained
in
a
close
embrace
clinging
to
him
supported
by
his
arms
with
head
buried
in
his
breast
was
a
girl
of
slight
and
slender
figure
graceful
though
not
tall
her
body
was
still
shaken
by
continual
struggling
sobs
the
prince
held
her
there
as
though
against
the
world
but
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
the
intruders
with
a
grave
sad
air
there
was
no
shame
on
his
face
and
hardly
surprise
presently
he
took
one
arm
from
about
the
lady
and
raising
it
motioned
to
them
to
be
still
osra
took
one
step
forward
towards
where
the
pair
stood
the
bishop
caught
her
sleeve
but
she
shook
him
off
the
lady
looked
up
into
the
prince
face
with
a
sudden
startled
cry
she
clutched
him
closer
and
turned
a
terrified
face
over
her
shoulder
then
she
moaned
in
great
fear
and
reeling
fell
against
the
prince
she
would
have
sunk
to
the
ground
if
he
had
not
upheld
her
and
her
eyes
closed
and
her
lip
dropped
as
she
swooned
away
but
the
princess
smiled
and
drawing
herself
to
her
full
height
stood
watching
while
ludwig
bore
the
lady
to
a
couch
and
laid
her
there
then
when
he
came
back
and
faced
her
she
asked
coldly
and
slowly
who
is
this
woman
sir
or
is
she
one
of
those
who
have
no
names
the
prince
sprang
forward
a
sudden
anger
in
his
eyes
he
raised
his
hand
as
if
he
would
have
pressed
it
across
her
scornful
mouth
and
kept
back
her
bitter
words
but
she
did
not
flinch
pointing
at
him
with
her
finger
she
cried
to
the
bishop
in
a
ringing
voice
kill
him
my
lord
kill
him
and
the
sword
of
the
bishop
of
modenstein
was
half
way
out
of
the
scabbard
i
would
to
god
my
lord
said
the
prince
in
low
sad
tones
that
god
would
suffer
you
to
kill
me
and
me
to
take
death
at
your
hands
but
neither
for
you
nor
for
me
is
the
blow
lawful
let
me
speak
to
the
princess
the
bishop
still
grasped
his
sword
for
osra
face
and
hand
still
commanded
him
but
at
the
instant
of
his
hesitation
while
the
temptation
was
hot
on
him
there
came
from
the
couch
where
the
lady
lay
a
low
moan
of
great
pain
she
flung
her
arms
out
and
turned
groaning
again
on
her
back
and
her
head
lay
hanging
over
the
side
of
the
couch
the
bishop
eyes
met
ludwig
and
with
a
god
forgive
me
he
let
the
sword
slip
back
and
springing
across
the
room
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
couch
he
broke
the
gold
chain
round
his
neck
and
grasped
the
crucifix
which
it
carried
in
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
raised
the
lady
head
praying
her
to
open
her
eyes
before
whose
closed
lids
he
held
the
sacred
image
and
he
who
had
come
so
near
to
great
sin
now
prayed
softly
but
fervently
for
her
life
and
god
pity
on
her
for
the
frailty
her
slight
form
showed
could
not
withstand
the
shock
of
this
trial
who
is
she
asked
the
princess
but
ludwig
eyes
had
wandered
back
to
the
couch
and
he
answered
only
my
god
it
will
kill
her
i
care
not
said
osra
but
then
came
another
low
moan
i
care
not
said
the
princess
again
ah
she
is
in
great
suffering
and
her
eyes
followed
the
prince
there
was
silence
save
for
the
lady
low
moans
and
the
whispered
prayers
of
the
bishop
of
modenstein
but
the
lady
opened
her
eyes
and
in
an
instant
answering
the
summons
the
prince
was
by
her
side
kneeling
and
holding
her
hand
very
tenderly
and
he
met
a
glance
from
the
bishop
across
her
prostrate
body
the
prince
bowed
his
head
and
one
sob
burst
from
him
leave
me
alone
with
her
for
a
little
sir
said
the
bishop
and
the
prince
obeying
rose
and
withdrew
into
the
bay
of
the
window
while
osra
stood
alone
near
the
door
by
which
she
had
entered
a
few
minutes
passed
then
osra
saw
the
prince
return
to
where
the
lady
was
and
kneel
again
beside
her
and
she
saw
that
the
bishop
was
preparing
to
perform
his
most
sacred
and
sublime
office
the
lady
eyes
dwelt
on
him
now
in
peace
and
restfulness
and
she
held
prince
hand
in
her
small
hand
but
osra
would
not
kneel
she
stood
upright
still
and
cold
as
though
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
of
what
passed
she
would
not
pity
nor
forgive
the
woman
even
if
as
they
seemed
to
think
she
lay
dying
but
she
spoke
once
asking
in
a
harsh
voice
is
there
no
physician
in
the
house
or
near
none
madame
said
the
prince
the
bishop
began
the
office
and
osra
stood
dimly
hearing
the
words
of
comfort
peace
and
hope
dimly
seeing
the
smile
on
the
lady
face
for
gradually
her
eyes
clouded
with
tears
now
her
ears
seemed
to
hear
nothing
save
the
sad
and
piteous
sobs
that
had
shaken
the
girl
as
she
hung
about
ludwig
neck
but
she
strove
to
drive
away
her
softer
thoughts
fanning
her
fury
when
it
burnt
low
and
telling
herself
again
of
the
insult
that
she
had
suffered
thus
she
rested
till
the
bishop
had
performed
the
office
but
when
he
had
finished
it
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
came
to
where
osra
was
it
was
your
duty
she
said
but
it
is
none
of
mine
she
will
not
live
an
hour
said
he
for
she
had
an
affection
of
the
heart
and
this
shock
has
killed
her
indeed
i
think
she
was
half
dead
for
grief
before
we
came
who
is
she
broke
again
from
osra
lips
come
and
hear
said
he
and
she
followed
him
obediently
yet
unwillingly
to
the
couch
and
looked
down
at
the
lady
the
lady
looked
at
her
with
wondering
eyes
and
then
she
smiled
faintly
pressing
the
prince
hand
and
whispering
yet
she
is
so
beautiful
and
she
seemed
now
wonderfully
happy
so
that
they
three
all
watched
her
and
were
envious
although
they
were
to
live
and
she
to
die
now
god
pardon
her
sin
said
the
princess
osra
suddenly
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
couch
crying
surely
god
has
pardoned
her
sin
she
has
none
save
what
clings
even
to
the
purest
in
this
world
said
the
bishop
for
what
she
has
said
to
me
i
know
to
be
true
osra
answered
nothing
but
gazed
in
questioning
at
the
prince
and
he
still
holding
the
lady
hand
began
to
speak
in
a
gentle
voice
do
not
ask
her
name
madame
but
from
the
first
hour
that
we
knew
the
meaning
of
love
we
have
loved
one
another
and
had
the
issue
rested
in
my
hands
i
would
have
thrown
to
the
winds
all
that
kept
me
from
her
i
remember
when
first
i
met
her
ah
my
sweet
do
you
remember
from
that
day
to
this
in
soul
she
has
been
mine
and
i
hers
in
all
my
life
but
more
could
not
be
madame
you
have
asked
what
love
is
here
is
love
yet
fate
is
stronger
thus
i
came
to
strelsau
to
woo
and
she
left
alone
resolved
to
give
herself
to
god
how
comes
she
here
then
whispered
osra
and
she
laid
one
hand
timidly
on
the
couch
near
to
the
lady
yet
not
so
as
to
touch
even
her
garments
she
came
here
he
began
but
suddenly
to
their
amazement
the
lady
who
had
seemed
dead
with
an
effort
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
spoke
in
a
quick
eager
whisper
as
if
she
feared
time
and
strength
would
fail
he
is
a
great
prince
she
said
he
must
be
a
great
king
god
means
him
for
greatness
god
forbid
that
i
should
be
his
ruin
ah
what
a
sweet
dream
he
painted
but
praise
be
to
the
blessed
saints
who
kept
me
strong
yet
at
the
last
i
was
weak
i
could
not
live
without
another
sight
of
his
face
and
so
i
came
next
week
i
am
i
was
to
take
the
veil
and
i
came
here
to
see
him
once
again
god
pardon
me
for
it
but
i
could
not
help
it
ah
madame
i
know
you
and
i
see
now
your
beauty
have
you
known
love
no
said
osra
and
she
moved
her
hand
near
to
the
lady
hand
when
he
found
me
here
he
prayed
me
again
to
do
what
he
asked
and
i
was
half
killed
in
denying
it
but
i
prevailed
and
we
were
even
then
parting
when
you
came
why
why
did
i
come
for
a
moment
her
voice
died
away
in
a
low
soft
moan
but
she
made
one
more
effort
clasping
hand
in
her
delicate
fingers
she
whispered
i
am
going
be
his
wife
no
no
no
whispered
osra
her
face
now
close
to
the
lady
you
must
live
you
must
live
and
be
happy
and
then
she
kissed
the
lady
lips
the
lady
put
out
her
arms
and
clasped
them
round
osra
neck
and
again
she
whispered
softly
in
ear
neither
ludwig
nor
the
bishop
heard
what
she
said
but
they
heard
only
that
osra
sobbed
presently
the
lady
arms
relaxed
a
little
in
their
hold
and
osra
having
kissed
her
again
rose
and
signed
to
ludwig
to
come
nearer
while
she
turning
gave
her
hand
to
the
bishop
and
he
led
her
from
the
room
and
finding
another
room
near
took
her
in
there
where
she
sat
silent
and
pale
thus
half
an
hour
passed
then
the
bishop
stole
out
softly
and
presently
returned
saying
god
has
spared
her
the
long
painful
path
and
has
taken
her
straight
to
his
rest
osra
heard
him
half
in
a
trance
and
as
if
she
did
not
hear
she
did
not
know
where
he
went
nor
what
he
did
nor
anything
that
passed
until
as
it
seemed
after
a
long
while
she
looked
up
and
saw
prince
ludwig
standing
before
her
he
was
composed
and
calm
but
it
seemed
as
if
half
the
life
had
gone
out
of
his
face
osra
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
supporting
herself
on
an
arm
of
the
chair
on
which
she
had
sat
and
when
she
had
seen
his
face
she
suddenly
threw
herself
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
crying
forgive
me
forgive
me
illustration
me
forgive
me
the
guilt
is
mine
said
he
i
did
not
trust
you
and
did
by
stealth
what
your
nobility
would
have
allowed
me
to
do
openly
the
guilt
is
mine
and
he
offered
to
raise
her
but
she
rose
unaided
asking
with
choking
voice
is
she
dead
she
is
dead
said
the
prince
and
osra
hearing
it
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
blindly
groped
her
way
back
to
the
chair
where
she
sat
panting
and
exhausted
to
her
i
have
said
farewell
and
now
madame
to
you
yet
do
not
think
that
i
am
a
man
without
eyes
for
your
beauty
or
a
heart
to
know
your
worth
i
seemed
to
you
a
fool
and
a
churl
i
grieved
most
bitterly
and
i
wronged
you
bitterly
my
excuse
for
all
is
now
known
for
though
you
are
more
beautiful
than
she
yet
true
love
is
no
wanderer
it
gives
a
beauty
that
it
does
not
find
and
forges
a
chain
no
charms
can
break
madame
farewell
she
looked
at
him
and
saw
the
sad
joy
in
his
eyes
an
exultation
over
what
had
been
that
what
was
could
not
destroy
and
she
knew
that
the
vision
was
still
with
him
though
his
love
was
dead
suddenly
he
seemed
to
her
a
man
she
also
might
love
and
for
whom
she
also
if
need
be
might
gladly
die
yet
not
because
she
loved
him
for
she
was
asking
still
in
wonder
what
is
this
love
madame
farewell
said
he
again
and
kneeling
before
her
he
kissed
her
hand
i
carry
the
body
of
my
love
he
went
on
back
with
me
to
my
home
there
to
mourn
for
her
and
i
shall
come
no
more
to
strelsau
osra
bent
her
eyes
on
his
face
as
he
knelt
and
presently
she
said
to
him
in
a
whisper
that
was
low
for
awe
not
shame
you
heard
what
she
bade
me
do
yes
madame
i
know
her
wish
and
you
would
do
it
she
asked
madame
my
struggle
was
fought
before
she
died
but
now
you
know
that
my
love
was
not
yours
that
also
i
knew
before
sir
and
a
slight
bitter
smile
came
on
her
face
but
she
grew
grave
again
and
sat
there
seeming
to
be
pondering
while
prince
ludwig
waited
then
she
suddenly
leant
forward
and
said
if
i
loved
i
would
wait
for
you
to
love
now
what
is
this
love
that
i
can
not
feel
and
then
she
sat
again
silent
but
at
last
raised
her
eyes
again
to
his
saying
in
a
voice
that
even
in
the
stillness
of
the
room
he
hardly
heard
now
i
nearly
love
you
for
i
have
seen
your
love
and
know
that
you
can
love
and
i
think
that
love
must
breed
love
so
that
she
who
loves
must
in
god
time
be
beloved
yet
i
she
paused
here
and
for
a
moment
hid
her
face
with
her
hand
yet
i
can
not
she
went
on
is
it
our
lord
christ
who
bids
us
take
the
lower
place
i
can
not
take
it
he
does
not
so
reign
in
my
heart
for
to
my
proud
heart
ah
my
heart
so
proud
she
would
be
ever
between
us
i
could
not
bear
it
yet
i
believe
now
that
with
you
i
might
one
day
find
happiness
the
prince
though
in
that
hour
he
could
not
think
of
love
was
yet
very
much
moved
by
her
new
tenderness
and
felt
that
what
had
passed
rather
drew
them
together
than
made
any
separation
between
them
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
dead
lady
blessing
was
on
his
suit
so
he
said
madame
i
would
most
faithfully
serve
you
and
you
would
be
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
of
all
living
women
she
waited
awhile
then
she
sighed
heavily
looking
in
his
face
with
an
air
of
wistful
longing
and
she
knit
her
brows
as
though
she
were
puzzled
but
at
last
shaking
her
head
she
said
it
is
not
enough
with
this
she
rose
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
they
two
went
back
together
to
where
the
bishop
of
modenstein
still
prayed
beside
the
body
of
the
lady
osra
stood
on
one
side
of
the
body
and
stretched
her
hand
out
to
the
prince
who
stood
on
the
other
side
see
said
she
she
must
be
between
us
and
having
kissed
the
dead
face
once
she
left
the
prince
there
by
the
side
of
his
love
and
herself
went
out
and
turning
her
head
she
saw
that
the
prince
knelt
again
by
the
corpse
of
his
love
he
does
not
think
of
me
she
said
to
the
bishop
his
thoughts
are
still
with
her
madame
he
answered
it
was
late
night
now
and
they
rode
swiftly
and
silently
along
the
road
to
strelsau
on
all
the
way
they
spoke
to
one
another
only
a
few
words
both
being
sunk
deep
in
thought
but
once
osra
spoke
as
they
were
already
near
to
strelsau
for
she
turned
suddenly
to
the
bishop
saying
my
lord
what
is
it
do
you
know
it
yes
madame
i
have
known
it
answered
the
bishop
yet
you
are
a
churchman
true
madame
said
he
and
he
smiled
sadly
she
seemed
to
consider
fixing
her
eyes
on
his
but
he
turned
his
aside
could
you
not
make
me
understand
she
asked
your
lover
when
he
comes
will
do
that
madame
said
he
and
still
he
kept
his
eyes
averted
osra
wondered
why
he
kept
his
eyes
turned
away
yet
presently
a
faint
smile
curved
her
lips
and
she
said
it
may
be
you
might
feel
it
if
you
were
not
a
churchman
but
i
do
not
many
men
have
said
they
loved
me
and
i
have
felt
something
in
my
heart
but
not
this
it
will
come
said
the
bishop
does
it
come
then
to
every
one
to
most
he
answered
heigho
will
it
ever
come
to
me
she
sighed
with
this
they
were
at
home
and
osra
was
for
a
long
time
very
sorrowful
for
the
fate
of
the
lady
whom
the
prince
of
glottenberg
had
loved
yet
since
she
saw
ludwig
no
more
and
the
joy
of
youth
conquers
sadness
she
ceased
to
mourn
but
as
she
walked
alone
she
would
wonder
more
and
more
what
it
might
be
this
great
love
that
she
did
not
feel
for
none
will
tell
me
not
even
the
bishop
of
modenstein
said
she
chapter
ix
the
victory
of
the
grand
duke
of
mittenheim
king
rudolf
being
in
the
worst
of
humours
had
declared
in
the
presence
of
all
the
court
that
women
were
born
to
plague
men
and
for
no
other
purpose
whatsoever
under
heaven
hearing
this
discourteous
speech
the
princess
osra
rose
and
said
that
for
her
part
she
would
go
walking
alone
by
the
river
outside
the
city
gates
where
at
least
she
would
be
assailed
by
no
more
reproaches
for
since
she
was
irrevocably
determined
to
live
and
die
unmarried
of
what
use
or
benefit
was
it
to
trouble
her
with
embassies
courting
or
proposals
from
either
the
grand
duke
of
mittenheim
or
anybody
else
she
was
utterly
weary
of
this
matter
of
love
and
her
mood
would
be
unchanged
though
this
new
suitor
were
as
exalted
as
the
king
of
france
as
rich
as
croesus
himself
and
as
handsome
as
the
god
apollo
she
did
not
desire
a
husband
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
thus
she
went
out
while
the
queen
sighed
and
the
king
fumed
and
the
courtiers
and
ladies
said
to
one
another
that
these
dissensions
made
life
very
uncomfortable
at
strelsau
the
ladies
further
adding
that
he
would
be
a
bold
man
who
married
osra
although
doubtless
she
was
not
to
the
banks
of
the
river
outside
the
walls
then
osra
went
and
as
she
went
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
in
the
world
least
of
all
of
whom
she
might
chance
to
meet
there
on
the
banks
of
the
river
where
in
those
busy
hours
of
the
day
few
came
yet
there
was
a
strange
new
light
in
her
eyes
and
there
seemed
a
new
understanding
in
her
mind
and
when
a
young
peasant
wife
came
by
her
baby
in
her
arms
osra
stopped
her
and
kissed
the
child
and
gave
money
and
then
ran
on
in
unexplained
confusion
laughing
and
blushing
as
though
she
had
done
something
which
she
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
then
without
reason
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
she
dashed
them
away
and
burst
suddenly
into
singing
and
she
was
still
singing
when
from
the
long
grass
by
the
river
edge
a
young
man
sprang
up
and
with
a
very
low
bow
drew
aside
to
let
her
pass
he
had
a
book
in
his
hand
for
he
was
a
student
at
the
university
and
came
there
to
pursue
his
learning
in
peace
his
plain
brown
clothes
spoke
of
no
wealth
or
station
though
certainly
they
set
off
a
stalwart
straight
shape
and
seemed
to
match
well
with
his
bright
brown
hair
and
hazel
eyes
very
low
this
young
man
bowed
and
osra
bent
her
head
the
pace
of
her
walk
slowed
grew
quicker
slowed
again
she
was
past
him
and
with
a
great
sigh
he
lay
down
again
she
turned
he
sprang
up
she
spoke
coldly
yet
kindly
illustration
a
young
man
sprang
up
and
with
a
low
bow
drew
aside
to
let
her
pass
sir
said
she
i
can
not
but
notice
that
you
lie
every
day
here
by
the
river
with
your
book
and
that
you
sigh
tell
me
your
trouble
and
if
i
can
i
will
relieve
it
i
am
reading
madame
he
answered
of
helen
of
troy
and
i
am
sighing
because
she
is
dead
it
is
an
old
grief
by
now
said
osra
smiling
will
none
serve
you
but
helen
of
troy
if
i
were
a
prince
said
he
i
need
not
mourn
no
sir
no
madame
he
said
with
another
bow
farewell
sir
madame
farewell
so
she
went
on
her
way
and
saw
him
no
more
till
the
next
day
nor
after
that
till
the
next
day
following
and
then
came
an
interval
when
she
saw
him
not
and
the
interval
was
no
less
than
hours
yet
still
he
read
of
helen
of
troy
and
still
sighed
because
she
was
dead
and
he
no
prince
at
last
he
tempted
the
question
from
osra
shy
smiling
lips
why
would
you
not
mourn
sir
if
you
were
a
prince
said
she
for
princes
and
princesses
have
their
share
of
sighs
and
with
a
very
plaintive
sigh
osra
looked
at
the
rapid
running
river
as
she
waited
for
his
answer
because
then
i
would
go
to
strelsau
and
so
forget
her
but
you
are
at
strelsau
now
she
cried
with
wondering
surprise
ah
but
i
am
no
prince
madame
said
he
can
princes
alone
forget
in
strelsau
how
should
a
poor
student
dare
to
forget
in
strelsau
as
he
spoke
he
made
bold
to
step
near
her
and
stood
close
looking
down
into
her
face
without
a
word
she
turned
and
left
him
going
through
the
meadow
with
a
step
that
seemed
to
dance
and
yet
led
her
to
her
own
chamber
where
she
could
weep
in
quiet
i
know
it
now
i
know
it
now
she
whispered
softly
that
night
to
the
tree
which
rose
by
her
window
heigho
what
am
i
to
do
i
can
not
live
no
and
now
i
can
not
die
ah
me
what
am
i
to
do
i
wish
i
were
a
peasant
girl
but
then
perhaps
he
would
not
ah
yes
but
he
would
and
her
low
long
laugh
rippled
in
triumph
through
the
night
blending
sweetly
with
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
under
a
summer
breeze
and
she
stretched
her
white
arms
to
heaven
imploring
the
kind
god
with
prayers
that
she
dared
not
speak
even
to
his
pitiful
ear
love
knows
no
princesses
my
princess
it
was
that
she
heard
as
she
fled
from
him
next
day
she
should
have
rebuked
him
but
for
that
she
must
have
stayed
and
to
stay
she
had
not
dared
but
she
must
rebuke
him
she
would
see
him
again
in
order
to
rebuke
him
yet
all
this
while
she
must
be
pestered
with
the
court
of
the
grand
duke
of
mittenheim
and
when
she
would
not
name
a
day
on
which
the
embassy
should
come
the
king
flew
into
a
passion
and
declared
that
he
himself
would
set
a
date
for
it
was
his
sister
mad
he
asked
that
she
would
do
nothing
but
walk
every
day
by
the
river
bank
surely
i
must
be
mad
thought
osra
for
no
sane
being
could
be
at
once
so
joyful
and
so
piteously
unhappy
did
he
know
what
it
was
he
asked
he
seemed
to
know
nothing
of
it
he
did
not
speak
any
more
now
of
princesses
only
of
his
princess
nor
of
queens
save
of
his
heart
queen
and
when
his
eyes
asked
love
they
asked
as
though
none
would
refuse
and
there
could
be
no
cause
for
refusal
he
would
have
wooed
his
neighbour
daughter
thus
and
thus
he
wooed
the
sister
of
king
rudolf
will
you
love
me
was
his
question
not
though
you
love
yet
dare
you
own
your
love
he
seemed
to
shut
the
whole
world
from
her
leaving
nothing
but
her
and
him
and
in
a
world
that
held
none
but
her
and
him
she
could
love
unblamed
untroubled
and
with
no
trembling
you
forget
who
i
am
she
faltered
once
you
are
the
beauty
of
the
world
he
answered
smiling
and
he
kissed
her
hand
a
matter
about
which
she
could
make
no
great
ado
for
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
he
had
kissed
it
illustration
are
the
beauty
of
the
world
he
answered
smiling
but
the
embassy
from
the
grand
duke
was
to
come
in
a
week
and
to
be
received
with
great
pomp
the
ambassador
was
already
on
the
way
carrying
proposals
and
gifts
therefore
osra
went
pale
and
sad
down
to
the
river
bank
that
day
having
declared
again
to
the
king
that
she
would
live
and
die
unmarried
but
the
king
had
laughed
cruelly
surely
she
needed
kindness
and
consolation
that
sad
day
yet
fate
had
kept
for
her
a
crowning
sorrow
for
she
found
him
also
almost
sad
at
least
she
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
sad
or
not
for
he
smiled
and
yet
seemed
ill
at
ease
like
a
man
who
ventures
a
fall
with
fortune
hoping
and
fearing
and
he
said
to
her
madame
in
a
week
i
return
to
my
own
country
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
with
lips
just
parted
for
her
life
she
could
not
speak
but
the
sun
grew
dark
and
the
river
changed
its
merry
tune
to
mournful
dirges
so
the
dream
ends
said
he
so
comes
the
awakening
but
if
life
were
all
a
dream
his
eyes
sought
hers
yes
she
whispered
if
life
were
all
a
dream
sir
then
i
should
dream
of
two
dreamers
whose
dream
was
one
and
in
that
dream
i
should
see
them
ride
together
at
break
of
day
from
strelsau
whither
she
murmured
to
paradise
said
he
but
the
dream
ends
if
it
did
not
end
he
paused
if
it
did
not
end
a
breathless
longing
whisper
echoed
if
it
did
not
end
now
it
should
not
end
even
with
death
said
he
you
see
them
in
your
dream
you
see
them
riding
aye
swiftly
side
by
side
they
two
alone
through
the
morning
none
is
near
none
knows
he
seemed
to
be
searching
her
face
for
something
that
yet
he
scarcely
hoped
to
find
their
dream
said
he
brings
them
at
last
to
a
small
cottage
it
is
where
they
live
they
live
and
work
he
added
for
she
keeps
his
home
while
he
works
what
does
she
do
asked
osra
with
smiling
wondering
eyes
she
gets
his
supper
for
him
when
he
comes
home
weary
in
the
evening
and
makes
a
bright
fire
and
ah
and
she
runs
to
meet
him
at
the
door
oh
farther
than
the
door
but
she
has
worked
hard
and
is
weary
no
she
is
not
weary
cried
osra
it
is
for
him
she
works
the
wise
say
this
is
silly
talk
said
he
the
wise
are
fools
then
cried
osra
so
the
dream
would
please
you
madame
he
asked
she
had
come
not
to
know
how
she
left
him
somehow
while
he
still
spoke
she
would
suddenly
escape
by
flight
he
did
not
pursue
but
let
her
go
so
now
she
returned
to
the
city
her
eyes
filled
with
that
golden
dream
she
entered
her
home
as
though
it
had
been
some
strange
palace
decked
with
unknown
magnificence
and
she
an
alien
to
it
for
her
true
home
seemed
now
rather
in
the
cottage
of
the
dream
and
she
moved
unfamiliarly
through
the
pomp
that
had
been
hers
from
birth
her
soul
was
gone
from
it
while
her
body
rested
there
and
life
stopped
for
her
till
she
saw
him
again
by
the
banks
of
the
river
in
five
days
now
i
go
said
he
and
he
smiled
at
her
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
still
he
smiled
but
suddenly
he
sprang
forward
for
she
had
sobbed
the
summons
had
sounded
he
was
there
and
who
could
sob
again
when
he
was
there
and
his
sheltering
arm
warded
off
all
grief
she
looked
up
at
him
with
shining
eyes
whispering
do
you
go
alone
a
great
joy
blazed
confidently
in
his
eyes
as
he
whispered
in
answer
i
think
i
shall
not
go
alone
but
how
how
i
have
two
horses
you
you
have
two
horses
yes
is
it
not
riches
but
we
will
sell
them
when
we
get
to
the
cottage
to
the
cottage
two
horses
i
would
i
had
but
one
for
both
of
us
yes
but
we
should
not
go
quick
enough
no
he
took
his
hand
from
her
waist
and
stood
away
from
her
you
will
not
come
he
said
if
you
doubt
of
my
coming
i
will
not
come
ah
do
not
doubt
of
my
coming
for
there
is
a
great
hoard
of
fears
and
black
thoughts
beating
at
the
door
and
you
must
not
open
it
and
what
can
keep
it
shut
my
princess
i
think
your
arm
my
prince
said
she
and
she
flew
to
him
that
evening
king
rudolf
swore
that
if
a
man
were
only
firm
enough
and
kept
his
temper
which
by
the
way
the
king
had
not
done
though
none
dared
say
so
he
could
bring
any
foolish
girl
to
reason
in
good
time
for
in
the
softest
voice
and
with
the
strangest
smile
flitting
to
her
face
the
princess
osra
was
pleased
to
bid
the
embassy
come
on
the
fifth
day
from
then
they
shall
have
their
answer
then
said
she
flushing
and
smiling
it
is
as
much
as
any
lady
could
say
the
court
declared
and
it
was
reported
through
all
strelsau
that
the
match
was
as
good
as
made
and
that
osra
was
to
be
grand
duchess
of
mittenheim
she
a
sensible
girl
after
all
cried
rudolf
all
his
anger
gone
the
dream
began
then
before
they
came
to
the
cottage
those
days
she
lived
in
its
golden
mists
that
shut
out
all
the
cold
world
from
her
moving
through
space
which
held
but
one
form
and
time
that
stood
still
waiting
for
one
divine
unending
moment
and
the
embassy
drew
near
to
strelsau
it
was
night
the
dead
of
night
and
all
was
still
in
the
palace
but
the
sentinel
by
the
little
gate
was
at
his
post
and
the
stood
by
the
western
gate
of
the
city
each
was
now
alone
but
to
each
an
hour
ago
a
man
had
come
stealthily
and
silently
through
the
darkness
and
each
was
richer
by
a
bag
of
gold
than
he
had
been
before
the
gold
was
osra
how
should
a
poor
student
whose
whole
fortune
was
two
horses
scatter
bags
of
gold
and
other
gold
osra
had
aye
five
hundred
crowns
would
not
that
be
a
brave
surprise
for
the
poor
student
and
she
alone
of
all
awake
stood
looking
round
her
room
entranced
with
the
last
aspect
of
it
over
the
city
also
she
looked
but
in
the
selfishness
of
her
joy
did
no
more
than
kiss
a
hasty
farewell
to
the
good
city
folk
who
loved
her
once
she
thought
that
maybe
some
day
he
and
she
would
steal
together
back
to
strelsau
and
sheltered
by
some
disguise
watch
the
king
ride
in
splendour
through
the
streets
but
if
not
why
what
was
strelsau
and
the
people
and
the
rest
ah
how
long
the
hours
were
before
those
two
horses
stood
by
the
little
gate
and
the
sentry
and
the
earned
their
bags
of
gold
so
she
passed
the
hours
the
last
long
lingering
hours
there
was
a
little
tavern
buried
in
the
narrowest
oldest
street
of
the
city
here
the
poor
student
had
lodged
here
in
the
back
room
a
man
sat
at
a
table
and
two
others
stood
before
him
these
two
seemed
gentlemen
and
their
air
spoke
of
military
training
they
stroked
long
moustaches
and
smiled
with
an
amusement
that
deference
could
not
hide
both
were
booted
and
wore
spurs
and
the
man
sitting
at
the
table
gave
them
orders
you
will
meet
the
embassy
he
said
to
one
about
ten
bring
it
to
the
place
i
have
appointed
and
wait
there
do
not
fail
the
officer
addressed
bowed
and
retired
a
minute
later
his
hoofs
clattered
through
the
streets
perhaps
he
also
had
a
bag
of
gold
for
the
opened
the
western
gate
for
him
and
he
rode
at
a
gallop
along
the
river
banks
till
he
reached
the
great
woods
that
stretch
to
within
ten
miles
of
strelsau
an
hour
after
we
are
gone
said
the
man
at
the
table
to
the
other
officer
go
warily
find
one
of
the
king
servants
and
hand
him
the
letter
give
no
account
of
how
you
came
by
it
and
say
nothing
of
who
you
are
all
that
is
necessary
is
in
the
letter
when
you
have
delivered
it
return
here
and
remain
in
close
hiding
till
you
hear
from
me
again
the
second
officer
bowed
the
man
at
the
table
rose
and
went
out
into
the
street
he
took
his
way
to
where
the
palace
rose
and
then
skirted
the
wall
of
its
gardens
till
he
came
to
the
little
gate
here
stood
two
horses
and
at
their
heads
a
man
it
is
well
you
may
go
said
the
student
and
he
was
left
alone
with
the
horses
they
were
good
horses
for
a
student
to
possess
the
thought
perhaps
crossed
their
owner
mind
for
he
laughed
softly
as
he
looked
at
them
then
he
also
fell
to
thinking
that
the
hours
were
long
and
a
fear
came
suddenly
upon
him
that
she
would
not
come
it
was
in
these
last
hours
that
doubts
crept
in
and
he
was
not
with
her
to
drive
them
away
would
the
great
trial
fail
would
she
shrink
at
the
last
but
he
would
not
think
it
of
her
and
he
was
smiling
again
when
the
clock
of
the
cathedral
struck
two
telling
him
that
no
more
than
an
hour
now
parted
her
from
him
for
she
would
come
the
princess
would
come
to
him
the
student
led
by
the
vision
of
that
cottage
in
the
dream
would
she
come
she
would
come
she
had
risen
from
her
knees
and
moved
to
and
fro
in
cautious
silence
making
her
last
preparations
she
had
written
a
word
of
love
for
the
brother
she
loved
for
some
day
of
course
rudolf
would
forgive
her
and
she
had
ready
all
that
she
took
with
her
the
five
hundred
crowns
one
ring
that
she
would
give
her
lover
some
clothes
to
serve
till
his
loving
labour
furnished
more
that
night
she
had
wept
and
she
had
laughed
now
she
neither
wept
nor
laughed
but
there
was
a
high
pride
in
her
face
and
gait
she
opened
the
door
of
her
room
and
walked
down
the
great
staircase
under
the
eyes
of
crowned
kings
who
hung
framed
upon
the
walls
and
as
she
went
she
seemed
indeed
their
daughter
for
her
head
was
erect
and
her
lips
set
firm
in
haughty
dignity
who
dared
to
say
that
she
did
anything
that
a
daughter
should
not
do
should
not
a
woman
love
love
should
be
her
diadem
and
so
with
this
proud
step
she
came
through
the
gardens
of
the
palace
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
nor
behind
but
with
her
face
set
straight
for
the
little
gate
and
she
walked
as
she
had
been
accustomed
to
walk
when
all
strelsau
looked
on
her
and
hailed
her
as
its
glory
and
its
darling
the
sentry
slept
or
seemed
to
sleep
her
face
was
not
even
veiled
when
she
opened
the
little
gate
she
would
not
veil
her
proud
face
it
was
his
to
look
on
now
when
he
would
and
thus
she
stood
for
an
instant
in
the
gateway
while
he
sprang
to
her
and
kneeling
carried
her
hand
to
his
lips
you
are
come
he
cried
for
though
he
had
believed
yet
he
wondered
i
am
come
she
smiled
is
not
the
word
of
a
princess
sure
ah
how
could
i
not
come
see
love
said
he
rising
day
dawns
in
royal
purple
for
you
and
golden
love
for
me
the
purple
is
for
my
king
and
the
love
for
me
she
whispered
as
he
led
her
to
the
horses
your
fortune
said
she
pointing
to
them
but
i
also
have
brought
a
dowry
fancy
five
hundred
crowns
and
her
mirth
and
happiness
burst
out
in
a
laugh
it
was
so
deliciously
little
five
hundred
crowns
she
was
mounted
now
and
he
stood
by
her
will
you
turn
back
he
said
you
shall
not
make
me
angry
said
she
come
mount
aye
i
must
mount
said
he
for
if
we
were
found
here
the
king
would
kill
me
for
the
first
time
the
peril
of
their
enterprise
seemed
to
strike
into
her
mind
and
turned
her
cheek
pale
ah
i
forgot
in
my
happiness
i
forgot
mount
mount
oh
if
he
found
you
he
mounted
once
they
clasped
hands
then
they
rode
swiftly
for
the
western
gate
veil
your
face
he
said
and
since
he
bade
her
she
obeyed
saying
but
i
can
see
you
through
the
veil
the
gate
stood
open
and
the
was
not
there
they
were
out
of
the
city
the
morning
air
blew
cold
and
pure
over
the
meadows
from
the
river
the
horses
stretched
into
an
eager
willing
gallop
osra
tore
her
veil
from
her
face
and
turned
on
him
eyes
of
radiant
triumph
it
is
done
she
cried
it
is
done
yes
it
is
done
my
princess
said
he
and
and
it
is
begun
my
prince
said
she
yes
and
it
is
begun
said
he
she
laughed
aloud
in
absolute
joy
and
for
a
moment
he
also
laughed
but
then
his
face
grew
grave
and
he
said
i
pray
you
may
never
grieve
for
it
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
wide
in
wonder
for
an
instant
she
seemed
puzzled
then
she
fell
again
to
laughing
grieve
for
it
said
she
between
her
merry
laughs
king
rudolf
was
a
man
who
lay
late
in
the
morning
and
he
was
not
well
pleased
to
be
roused
when
the
clock
had
but
just
struck
four
yet
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
readily
enough
for
he
imagined
that
the
embassy
from
the
grand
duke
of
mittenheim
must
be
nearer
than
he
thought
and
sooner
than
fail
in
any
courtesy
towards
a
prince
whose
alliance
he
ardently
desired
he
was
ready
to
submit
to
much
inconvenience
but
his
astonishment
was
great
when
instead
of
any
tidings
from
the
embassy
one
of
his
gentlemen
handed
him
a
letter
saying
that
a
servant
had
received
it
from
a
stranger
with
instructions
to
carry
it
at
once
to
the
king
when
asked
if
an
answer
were
desired
from
his
majesty
the
stranger
had
answered
not
through
me
and
at
once
turned
away
and
quickly
disappeared
the
king
with
a
peevish
oath
at
having
been
roused
for
such
a
trifle
broke
the
seal
and
fastenings
of
the
letter
and
opened
it
and
he
read
sire
your
sister
does
not
wait
for
the
embassy
but
chooses
her
own
lover
she
has
met
a
student
of
the
university
every
day
for
the
last
three
weeks
by
the
river
bank
the
king
started
this
morning
she
has
fled
with
him
on
horseback
along
the
western
road
if
you
desire
a
student
for
a
sleep
again
if
not
up
and
ride
do
not
doubt
these
tidings
there
was
no
signature
to
the
letter
yet
the
king
knowing
his
sister
cried
see
whether
the
princess
is
in
the
palace
and
in
the
meanwhile
saddle
my
horse
and
let
a
dozen
of
the
guard
be
at
the
gate
the
princess
was
not
in
the
palace
but
her
women
found
the
letter
that
she
had
left
and
brought
it
to
the
king
and
the
king
read
brother
whom
i
love
best
of
all
men
in
the
world
save
one
i
have
left
you
to
go
with
that
one
you
will
not
forgive
me
now
but
some
day
forgive
me
nay
it
is
not
i
who
have
done
it
but
my
love
which
is
braver
than
i
he
is
the
sweetest
gentleman
alive
brother
and
therefore
he
must
be
my
lord
let
me
go
but
still
love
osra
it
is
true
said
the
king
and
the
embassy
will
be
here
for
a
moment
he
seemed
dazed
yet
he
spoke
nothing
to
anybody
of
what
the
letters
contained
but
sent
word
to
the
queen
apartments
that
he
went
riding
for
pleasure
and
he
took
his
sword
and
his
pistols
for
he
swore
that
by
his
own
hand
and
by
that
of
no
other
man
this
sweetest
gentleman
alive
should
meet
his
death
but
all
knowing
that
the
princess
was
not
in
the
palace
guessed
that
the
king
sudden
haste
concerned
her
and
great
wonder
and
speculation
rose
in
the
palace
and
presently
as
the
morning
advanced
spread
from
the
palace
to
its
environs
and
from
the
environs
to
the
rest
of
the
city
for
it
was
reported
that
a
sentinel
who
had
stood
guard
that
night
was
missing
and
that
the
of
the
western
gate
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
that
a
mysterious
letter
had
come
by
an
unknown
hand
to
the
king
and
lastly
that
princess
osra
their
princess
was
gone
whether
of
her
own
will
or
by
some
bold
plot
of
seizure
and
kidnapping
none
knew
thus
a
great
stir
grew
in
all
strelsau
men
stood
about
the
streets
gossiping
when
they
should
have
gone
to
work
while
women
chattered
instead
of
sweeping
their
houses
and
dressing
their
children
so
that
when
the
king
rode
out
of
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
at
a
gallop
with
twelve
of
the
guard
behind
he
could
hardly
make
his
way
through
the
streets
for
the
people
who
crowded
round
him
imploring
him
to
tell
them
where
the
princess
was
when
the
king
saw
that
the
matter
had
become
public
his
wrath
was
greater
still
and
he
swore
again
that
the
student
of
the
university
should
pay
the
price
of
life
for
his
morning
ride
with
the
princess
and
when
he
darted
through
the
gate
and
set
his
horse
straight
along
the
western
road
many
of
the
people
neglecting
all
their
business
as
folk
will
for
excitement
sake
followed
him
as
they
best
could
agog
to
see
the
thing
to
its
end
the
horses
are
weary
said
the
student
to
the
princess
we
must
let
them
rest
we
are
now
in
the
shelter
of
the
wood
but
my
brother
may
pursue
you
she
urged
and
if
he
came
up
with
you
ah
heaven
forbid
he
will
not
know
you
have
gone
for
another
three
hours
smiled
he
and
here
is
a
green
bank
where
we
can
rest
so
he
aided
her
to
dismount
then
saying
he
would
tether
the
horses
he
led
them
away
some
distance
so
that
she
could
not
see
where
he
had
posted
them
and
he
returned
to
her
smiling
still
then
he
took
from
his
pocket
some
bread
and
breaking
the
loaf
in
two
gave
her
one
half
saying
there
is
a
spring
just
here
so
we
shall
have
a
good
breakfast
is
this
your
breakfast
she
asked
with
a
wondering
laugh
then
she
began
to
eat
and
cried
directly
how
delicious
this
bread
is
i
would
have
nothing
else
for
breakfast
and
at
this
the
student
laughed
yet
osra
ate
little
of
the
bread
she
liked
so
well
presently
she
leant
against
her
lover
shoulder
and
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
they
sat
for
a
little
while
in
silence
listening
to
the
soft
sounds
that
filled
the
waking
woods
as
day
grew
to
fulness
and
the
sun
beat
warm
through
the
sheltering
foliage
do
you
hear
the
trees
osra
whispered
to
her
lover
do
you
hear
them
they
are
whispering
for
me
what
i
dare
not
whisper
what
is
it
they
whisper
sweet
he
asked
he
himself
did
no
more
than
whisper
the
trees
whisper
love
love
and
the
wind
do
you
hear
the
wind
murmuring
love
love
and
the
birds
sing
love
love
aye
all
the
world
is
softly
whispering
love
love
what
else
should
the
great
world
whisper
but
my
love
for
my
love
is
greater
than
the
world
and
she
suddenly
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
he
could
kiss
no
more
than
her
hands
though
her
eyes
gleamed
at
him
from
between
slim
white
fingers
but
suddenly
her
hands
dropped
and
she
leant
forward
as
though
she
listened
what
is
that
sound
she
asked
apprehension
dawning
in
her
eyes
it
is
but
another
whisper
love
said
he
nay
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
ah
like
the
noise
of
horses
galloping
it
is
but
the
stream
beating
over
stones
listen
listen
listen
she
cried
springing
to
her
feet
they
are
horses
hoofs
ah
merciful
god
it
is
the
king
and
she
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
pulled
him
to
his
feet
looking
at
him
with
a
face
pale
and
alarmed
not
the
king
said
he
he
would
not
know
yet
it
is
some
one
else
hide
your
face
dear
lady
and
all
will
be
well
it
is
the
king
she
cried
hark
how
they
gallop
on
the
road
it
is
my
brother
love
he
will
kill
you
love
he
will
kill
you
it
is
the
king
said
he
i
have
been
betrayed
the
horses
the
horses
she
cried
by
your
love
for
me
the
horses
he
nodded
his
head
and
turning
disappeared
among
the
trees
she
stood
with
clasped
hands
heaving
breast
and
fearful
eyes
awaiting
his
return
minutes
passed
and
he
did
not
come
she
flung
herself
on
her
knees
beseeching
heaven
for
his
life
at
last
he
came
alone
and
he
bent
over
her
taking
her
hand
my
love
said
he
the
horses
are
gone
gone
she
cried
gripping
his
hand
aye
this
love
my
love
is
a
wonderful
thing
for
i
forgot
to
tie
them
and
they
are
gone
yet
what
matter
for
the
king
yes
sweet
i
think
now
it
is
the
king
will
not
be
here
for
some
minutes
yet
and
those
minutes
i
have
still
for
love
and
life
he
will
kill
you
she
said
yes
said
he
she
looked
long
in
his
eyes
then
she
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
for
the
first
time
unasked
covered
his
face
with
kisses
kiss
me
kiss
me
said
she
and
he
kissed
her
then
she
drew
back
a
little
but
took
his
arm
and
set
it
round
her
waist
and
she
drew
a
little
knife
from
her
girdle
and
showed
it
to
him
if
the
king
will
not
pardon
us
and
let
us
love
one
another
i
also
will
die
said
she
and
her
voice
was
quiet
and
happy
indeed
my
love
i
should
not
grieve
ah
do
not
tell
me
to
live
without
you
would
you
obey
he
asked
not
in
that
said
she
thus
they
stood
while
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
drew
very
near
but
she
looked
up
at
him
and
he
looked
at
her
then
she
looked
at
the
point
of
the
little
dagger
and
she
whispered
keep
your
arm
round
me
till
i
die
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
once
again
saying
my
princess
it
is
enough
and
she
though
she
did
not
know
why
he
smiled
yet
smiled
back
at
him
for
although
life
was
sweet
that
day
yet
such
a
death
with
him
and
to
prove
her
love
for
him
seemed
as
sweet
thus
they
awaited
the
coming
of
the
king
king
rudolf
and
his
guards
far
outstripped
the
people
who
pursued
them
from
the
city
and
when
they
came
to
the
skirt
of
the
wood
they
divided
themselves
into
four
parties
since
if
they
went
all
together
they
might
easily
miss
the
fugitives
whom
they
sought
of
these
four
parties
one
found
nothing
another
found
the
two
horses
which
the
student
himself
who
had
hidden
them
failed
to
find
the
third
party
had
not
gone
far
before
they
caught
sight
of
the
lovers
though
the
lovers
did
not
see
them
and
two
of
them
remained
to
watch
and
if
need
were
to
intercept
any
attempted
flight
while
the
other
rode
off
to
find
the
king
and
bring
him
where
osra
and
the
student
were
as
he
had
commanded
but
the
fourth
party
with
which
the
king
was
though
it
did
not
find
the
fugitives
found
the
embassy
from
the
grand
duke
of
mittenheim
for
the
ambassador
with
all
his
train
was
resting
by
the
roadside
seeming
in
no
haste
at
all
to
reach
strelsau
when
the
king
suddenly
rode
up
at
great
speed
and
came
upon
the
embassy
an
officer
that
stood
by
the
ambassador
whose
name
was
count
sergius
of
antheim
stooped
down
and
whispered
in
his
excellency
ear
upon
which
he
rose
and
advanced
towards
the
king
uncovering
his
head
and
bowing
profoundly
for
he
chose
to
assume
that
the
king
had
ridden
to
meet
him
out
of
excessive
graciousness
and
courtesy
towards
the
grand
duke
so
that
he
began
to
the
impatient
king
infinite
annoyance
to
make
a
very
long
and
stately
speech
assuring
his
majesty
of
the
great
hope
and
joy
with
which
his
master
awaited
the
result
of
the
embassy
for
said
he
since
the
king
was
so
zealous
in
his
cause
his
master
could
not
bring
himself
to
doubt
of
success
and
therefore
most
confidently
looked
to
win
for
his
bride
the
most
exalted
and
lovely
lady
in
the
world
the
peerless
princess
osra
the
glory
of
the
court
of
strelsau
and
the
brightest
jewel
in
the
crown
of
the
king
her
brother
having
brought
this
period
to
a
prosperous
conclusion
count
sergius
took
breath
and
began
another
that
promised
to
be
fully
as
magnificent
and
not
a
whit
less
long
so
that
before
it
was
well
started
the
king
smote
his
hand
on
his
thigh
and
roared
heavens
man
while
you
making
speeches
that
rascal
is
carrying
off
my
sister
count
sergius
who
was
an
elderly
man
of
handsome
presence
and
great
dignity
being
thus
rudely
and
strangely
interrupted
showed
great
astonishment
and
offence
but
the
officer
by
him
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand
to
hide
a
smile
for
the
moment
that
the
king
had
spoken
these
impetuous
words
he
was
himself
overwhelmed
with
confusion
since
the
last
thing
that
he
wished
the
grand
duke
ambassador
to
know
was
that
the
princess
whom
his
master
courted
had
run
away
that
morning
with
a
student
of
the
university
of
strelsau
accordingly
he
began
very
hastily
and
with
more
regard
for
prudence
than
for
truth
to
tell
count
sergius
how
a
noted
and
bold
criminal
had
that
morning
swooped
down
on
the
princess
as
she
rode
unattended
outside
the
city
and
carried
her
off
which
seemed
to
the
ambassador
a
very
strange
story
but
the
king
told
it
with
great
fervour
and
he
besought
the
count
to
scatter
his
attendants
all
through
the
wood
and
seek
the
robber
yet
he
charged
them
not
to
kill
the
man
themselves
but
to
keep
him
till
he
came
for
i
have
sworn
to
kill
him
with
my
own
hand
he
cried
now
count
sergius
however
much
astonished
he
might
be
could
do
nothing
but
accede
to
the
king
request
and
he
sent
off
all
his
men
to
scour
the
woods
and
mounting
his
horse
himself
set
out
with
them
showing
great
zeal
in
the
king
service
but
still
thinking
the
king
story
a
very
strange
one
thus
the
king
was
left
alone
with
his
two
guards
and
with
the
officer
who
had
smiled
will
you
not
go
also
sir
asked
the
king
but
at
this
moment
a
man
galloped
up
at
furious
speed
crying
we
have
found
them
sire
we
have
found
them
then
he
has
five
minutes
to
live
cried
the
king
in
fierce
joy
and
he
lugged
out
his
sword
adding
the
moment
i
set
my
eyes
on
him
i
will
kill
him
there
is
no
need
for
words
between
me
and
him
at
this
speech
the
face
of
the
officer
grew
suddenly
grave
and
alarmed
and
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
hastened
after
the
king
who
had
at
once
dashed
away
in
the
direction
in
which
the
man
had
pointed
but
the
king
had
got
a
start
and
kept
it
so
that
the
officer
seemed
terribly
frightened
and
muttered
to
himself
heaven
send
that
he
does
not
kill
him
before
he
knows
and
he
added
some
very
impatient
words
concerning
the
follies
of
princes
and
above
all
of
princes
in
love
thus
while
the
ambassador
and
his
men
searched
high
and
low
for
the
noted
robber
and
the
king
men
hunted
for
the
student
of
the
university
the
king
followed
by
two
of
his
guards
at
a
distance
of
about
fifty
yards
for
his
horse
was
better
than
theirs
came
straight
to
where
osra
and
her
lover
stood
together
a
few
yards
behind
the
guards
came
the
officer
and
he
also
had
by
now
drawn
his
sword
but
he
rode
so
eagerly
that
he
overtook
and
passed
the
king
guards
and
got
within
thirty
yards
of
the
king
by
the
time
that
the
king
was
within
twenty
of
the
lovers
but
the
king
let
him
get
no
nearer
for
he
dug
his
spurs
again
into
his
horse
side
and
the
animal
bounded
forward
while
the
king
cried
furiously
to
his
sister
stand
away
from
him
the
princess
did
not
heed
but
stood
in
front
of
her
lover
for
the
student
was
wholly
unarmed
holding
up
the
little
dagger
in
her
hand
the
king
laughed
scornfully
and
angrily
thinking
that
osra
menaced
him
with
the
weapon
and
not
supposing
that
it
was
herself
for
whom
she
destined
it
and
having
reached
them
the
king
leapt
from
his
horse
and
ran
at
them
with
his
sword
raised
to
strike
osra
gave
a
cry
of
terror
mercy
she
cried
mercy
but
the
king
had
no
thought
of
mercy
and
he
would
certainly
then
and
there
have
killed
her
lover
had
not
the
officer
gaining
a
moment
time
by
the
king
dismounting
at
this
very
instant
come
galloping
up
and
there
being
no
leisure
for
any
explanation
he
leant
from
his
saddle
as
he
dashed
by
and
putting
out
his
hand
snatched
the
king
sword
away
from
him
just
as
the
king
was
about
to
thrust
it
through
his
sister
lover
but
the
officer
horse
was
going
so
furiously
that
he
could
not
stop
it
for
hard
on
forty
yards
he
narrowly
escaped
splitting
his
head
against
a
great
bough
that
hung
low
across
the
grassy
path
and
he
dropped
first
his
own
sword
and
then
the
king
but
at
last
he
brought
his
horse
to
a
standstill
and
leaping
down
ran
back
towards
where
the
swords
lay
but
at
the
moment
the
king
also
ran
towards
them
for
the
fury
that
he
had
been
in
before
was
as
nothing
to
that
which
now
possessed
him
after
his
sword
was
snatched
from
him
he
stood
in
speechless
anger
for
a
full
minute
but
then
had
turned
to
pursue
the
man
who
had
dared
to
treat
him
with
such
insult
and
now
in
his
desire
to
be
at
the
officer
he
had
come
very
near
to
forgetting
the
student
just
as
the
officer
came
to
where
the
king
sword
lay
and
picked
it
up
the
king
in
his
turn
reached
the
officer
sword
and
picked
up
that
the
king
came
with
a
rush
at
the
officer
who
seeing
that
the
king
was
likely
to
kill
him
or
he
the
king
if
he
stood
his
ground
turned
tail
and
sped
away
at
the
top
of
his
speed
through
the
forest
but
as
he
went
thinking
that
the
time
had
come
for
plain
speaking
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
shouted
sire
it
the
grand
duke
himself
the
king
stopped
short
in
sudden
amazement
is
the
man
mad
he
asked
who
is
the
grand
duke
it
the
grand
duke
sire
who
is
with
the
princess
you
would
have
killed
him
if
i
had
not
snatched
your
sword
said
the
officer
and
he
also
came
to
a
halt
but
he
kept
a
very
wary
eye
on
king
rudolf
i
should
certainly
have
killed
him
let
him
be
who
he
will
said
the
king
but
why
do
you
call
him
the
grand
duke
the
officer
very
cautiously
approached
the
king
and
seeing
that
the
king
made
no
threatening
motion
he
at
last
trusted
himself
so
close
that
he
could
speak
to
the
king
in
a
very
low
voice
and
what
he
said
seemed
to
astonish
please
and
amuse
the
king
immensely
for
he
clapped
the
officer
on
the
back
laughed
heartily
and
cried
a
pretty
trick
on
my
life
a
pretty
trick
now
osra
and
her
lover
had
not
heard
what
the
officer
had
shouted
to
the
king
and
when
osra
saw
her
brother
returning
from
among
the
trees
alone
and
with
his
sword
she
still
supposed
that
her
lover
must
die
so
she
turned
and
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
clung
to
him
for
a
moment
kissing
him
then
she
faced
the
king
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
the
little
dagger
in
her
hand
but
the
king
came
up
wearing
a
scornful
smile
and
he
asked
her
what
is
the
dagger
for
my
wilful
sister
for
me
if
you
kill
him
said
she
you
will
kill
yourself
then
if
i
kill
him
i
would
not
live
a
moment
after
he
was
dead
faith
it
is
wonderful
said
the
king
with
a
shrug
then
plainly
if
you
can
not
live
without
him
you
must
live
with
him
he
is
to
be
your
husband
not
mine
therefore
take
him
if
you
will
when
osra
heard
this
which
indeed
for
joy
and
wonder
she
could
hardly
believe
she
dropped
her
dagger
and
running
forward
fell
on
her
knees
before
her
brother
catching
his
hand
she
covered
it
with
kisses
and
her
tears
mingled
with
her
kisses
but
the
king
let
her
go
on
and
stood
over
her
laughing
and
looking
at
the
student
presently
the
student
began
to
laugh
also
and
he
had
just
advanced
a
step
towards
king
rudolf
when
count
sergius
of
antheim
the
grand
duke
ambassador
came
out
from
among
the
trees
riding
hotly
and
with
great
zeal
after
the
noted
robber
but
no
sooner
did
the
count
see
the
student
than
he
stopped
his
horse
leapt
down
with
a
cry
of
wonder
and
running
up
to
the
student
bowed
very
low
and
kissed
his
hand
so
that
when
osra
looked
round
from
her
kissing
of
her
brother
hand
she
beheld
the
grand
duke
ambassador
kissing
the
hand
of
her
lover
she
sprang
to
her
feet
in
wonder
who
are
you
she
cried
to
the
student
running
in
between
him
and
the
ambassador
your
lover
and
servant
said
he
and
besides
she
said
why
in
a
month
your
husband
laughed
the
king
taking
her
lover
by
the
hand
he
clasped
the
king
hand
but
turned
at
once
to
her
saying
humbly
alas
i
have
no
cottage
who
are
you
she
whispered
to
him
the
man
for
whom
you
were
ready
to
die
my
princess
is
it
not
enough
yes
it
is
enough
said
she
and
she
did
not
repeat
her
question
but
the
king
with
a
short
laugh
turned
on
his
heel
and
taking
count
sergius
by
the
arm
walked
off
with
him
and
presently
they
called
the
officer
and
learnt
fully
how
the
grand
duke
had
come
to
strelsau
and
how
he
had
contrived
to
woo
and
win
the
princess
osra
and
finally
to
carry
her
off
from
the
palace
it
was
an
hour
later
when
the
whole
of
the
two
companies
that
of
the
king
and
that
of
the
ambassador
were
all
gathered
together
again
and
had
heard
the
story
so
that
when
the
king
went
to
where
osra
and
the
grand
duke
walked
together
among
the
trees
and
taking
each
by
a
hand
led
them
out
they
were
greeted
with
a
great
cheer
they
mounted
their
horses
which
the
grand
duke
now
found
without
any
difficulty
although
when
the
need
of
them
seemed
far
greater
the
student
could
not
contrive
to
come
upon
them
and
the
whole
company
rode
together
out
of
the
wood
and
along
the
road
towards
strelsau
the
king
being
full
of
jokes
and
hugely
delighted
with
a
trick
that
suited
his
merry
fancy
but
before
they
had
ridden
far
they
met
the
great
crowd
which
had
come
out
from
strelsau
to
learn
what
had
happened
to
princess
osra
and
the
king
cried
out
that
the
grand
duke
was
to
marry
the
princess
while
his
guards
who
had
been
with
him
and
the
ambassador
people
spread
themselves
among
the
crowd
and
told
the
story
and
when
they
heard
it
the
strelsau
folk
were
nearly
beside
themselves
with
amusement
and
delight
and
thronged
round
osra
kissing
her
hands
and
blessing
her
the
king
drew
back
and
let
her
and
the
grand
duke
ride
alone
together
while
he
followed
with
count
sergius
thus
moving
at
a
very
slow
pace
they
came
in
the
forenoon
to
strelsau
but
some
one
had
galloped
on
ahead
with
the
news
and
the
cathedral
bells
had
been
set
ringing
the
streets
were
full
and
the
whole
city
given
over
to
excitement
and
rejoicing
all
the
men
were
that
day
in
love
with
princess
osra
and
what
is
more
they
told
their
sweethearts
so
and
these
found
no
other
revenge
than
to
blow
kisses
and
fling
flowers
at
the
grand
duke
as
he
rode
past
with
osra
by
his
side
so
they
came
back
to
the
palace
whence
they
had
fled
in
the
early
gleams
of
the
morning
light
it
was
evening
and
the
moon
rose
fair
and
clear
over
strelsau
in
the
streets
there
were
sounds
of
merriment
and
rejoicing
every
house
was
bright
with
light
the
king
had
sent
out
meat
and
wine
for
every
soul
in
the
city
that
none
might
be
sad
or
hungry
or
thirsty
in
all
the
city
that
night
so
that
there
was
no
small
uproar
the
king
himself
sat
in
his
toasting
the
bride
and
bridegroom
in
company
with
count
sergius
of
antheim
whose
dignity
somewhat
wounded
by
the
trick
his
master
had
played
on
him
was
healing
quickly
under
the
balm
of
king
rudolf
graciousness
and
the
king
said
to
count
sergius
my
lord
were
you
ever
in
love
i
was
sire
said
the
count
so
was
i
said
the
king
was
it
with
the
countess
my
lord
count
sergius
eyes
twinkled
demurely
but
he
answered
i
take
it
sire
that
it
must
have
been
with
the
countess
and
i
take
it
said
the
king
that
it
must
have
been
with
the
queen
then
they
both
laughed
and
then
they
both
sighed
and
the
king
touching
the
count
elbow
pointed
out
to
the
terrace
of
the
palace
on
to
which
the
room
where
they
were
opened
for
princess
osra
and
her
lover
were
walking
up
and
down
together
on
this
terrace
and
the
two
shrugged
their
shoulders
smiling
with
him
remarked
the
king
it
will
have
been
with
the
countess
sire
discreetly
interrupted
count
sergius
of
antheim
why
yes
the
countess
said
the
king
and
with
a
laugh
they
turned
back
to
their
wine
but
the
two
on
the
terrace
also
talked
i
do
not
yet
understand
it
said
princess
osra
for
on
the
first
day
i
loved
you
and
on
the
second
day
i
loved
you
and
on
the
third
and
the
fourth
and
every
day
i
loved
you
yet
the
first
day
was
not
like
the
second
nor
the
second
like
the
third
nor
any
day
like
any
other
and
again
is
unlike
them
all
is
love
so
various
and
full
of
changes
is
it
not
he
asked
with
a
smile
for
while
you
were
with
the
queen
talking
of
i
know
not
what
nor
i
indeed
said
osra
hastily
i
was
with
the
king
and
he
saying
that
forewarned
was
forearmed
told
me
very
strange
and
pretty
stories
of
some
a
report
had
reached
me
before
and
yet
you
came
to
strelsau
while
of
others
i
had
not
heard
or
you
would
not
have
come
to
strelsau
the
grand
duke
not
heeding
these
questions
proceeded
to
his
conclusion
love
therefore
said
he
is
very
various
for
de
m√©rosailles
these
are
old
stories
cried
osra
pretending
to
stop
her
ears
loved
in
one
way
and
stephen
the
smith
in
another
and
the
miller
of
hofbau
in
a
third
i
think
said
osra
that
i
have
forgotten
the
miller
of
hofbau
but
can
one
heart
love
in
many
different
ways
i
know
that
different
men
love
differently
but
can
not
one
heart
love
in
different
ways
he
smiled
may
be
said
osra
thoughtfully
one
heart
can
have
loved
but
then
she
suddenly
looked
up
at
him
with
a
mischievous
sparkle
in
her
eyes
no
no
she
cried
it
was
not
love
it
was
what
was
it
the
courtiers
entertained
me
till
the
king
came
she
said
with
a
blushing
laugh
and
looking
up
at
him
again
she
whispered
yet
i
am
glad
that
you
lingered
for
a
little
at
this
moment
she
saw
the
king
come
out
on
to
the
terrace
with
him
was
the
bishop
of
modenstein
and
after
the
bishop
had
been
presented
to
the
grand
duke
the
king
began
to
talk
with
the
grand
duke
while
the
bishop
kissed
osra
hand
and
wished
her
joy
madame
said
he
once
you
asked
me
if
i
could
make
you
understand
what
love
was
i
take
it
you
have
no
need
for
my
lessons
now
your
teacher
has
come
yes
he
has
come
she
said
gently
looking
at
the
bishop
with
friendliness
but
tell
me
will
he
always
love
me
surely
he
will
answered
the
bishop
and
tell
me
said
osra
shall
i
always
love
him
surely
said
the
bishop
again
most
courteously
yet
indeed
madame
he
continued
it
would
seem
almost
enough
to
ask
of
heaven
to
love
now
and
now
to
be
loved
for
the
years
roll
on
and
youth
goes
and
even
the
most
incomparable
beauty
will
yield
its
blossom
when
the
season
wanes
yet
that
sweet
memory
may
ever
be
fresh
and
young
a
thing
a
man
can
carry
to
his
grave
and
raise
as
her
best
monument
on
his
lady
tomb
ah
you
speak
well
of
love
said
she
i
marvel
that
you
speak
so
well
of
love
for
it
is
as
you
say
in
the
wood
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
lived
enough
and
that
even
death
was
but
love
servant
as
life
is
and
both
purposed
solely
for
his
better
ornament
men
have
died
because
they
loved
you
madame
and
some
yet
live
who
love
you
said
the
bishop
and
shall
i
grieve
for
both
my
lord
or
for
which
for
neither
madame
the
dead
have
gained
peace
and
they
who
live
have
escaped
forgetfulness
but
would
they
not
be
happier
for
forgetting
i
do
not
think
so
said
the
bishop
and
bowing
low
to
her
again
he
stood
back
for
he
saw
the
king
approaching
with
the
grand
duke
the
king
took
him
by
the
arm
and
walked
on
with
him
but
osra
face
lost
the
brief
pensiveness
that
had
come
upon
it
as
she
talked
with
the
bishop
and
turning
to
her
lover
she
stretched
out
her
hands
to
him
saying
i
wish
there
was
a
cottage
and
that
you
worked
for
bread
while
i
made
ready
for
you
at
the
cottage
and
then
ran
far
far
far
down
the
road
to
watch
and
wait
for
your
coming
since
a
cottage
was
not
too
small
a
palace
will
not
be
too
large
said
he
catching
her
in
his
arms
thus
the
heart
of
princess
osra
found
its
haven
and
its
rest
for
a
month
later
she
was
married
to
the
grand
duke
of
mittenheim
in
the
cathedral
of
strelsau
having
utterly
refused
to
take
any
other
place
for
her
wedding
again
she
and
he
rode
forth
together
through
the
western
gate
and
the
king
rode
with
them
on
their
way
till
they
came
to
the
woods
here
he
paused
and
all
the
crowd
that
accompanied
him
stopped
also
and
they
all
waited
till
the
sombre
depths
of
the
glades
hid
osra
and
her
lover
from
their
sight
then
leaving
them
thus
riding
together
to
their
happiness
the
people
returned
home
sad
for
the
loss
of
their
darling
princess
but
for
consolation
and
that
their
minds
might
the
less
feel
her
absence
they
had
her
name
often
on
their
lips
and
the
poets
and
storytellers
composed
many
stories
about
her
not
grounded
on
fact
as
are
those
which
have
been
here
set
forth
but
the
fabric
of
idle
imaginings
wrought
to
please
the
fancy
of
lovers
or
to
wake
the
memories
of
older
folk
so
that
if
a
stranger
goes
now
to
strelsau
he
may
be
pardoned
if
it
seem
to
him
that
all
mankind
was
in
love
with
princess
osra
nay
and
those
stories
so
pass
all
fair
bounds
that
if
you
listen
to
them
you
will
come
near
to
believing
that
the
princess
also
had
found
some
love
for
all
the
men
who
had
given
her
their
love
thus
to
many
she
is
less
a
woman
who
once
lived
and
breathed
than
some
sweet
image
under
whose
name
they
fondly
group
all
the
virtues
and
the
charms
of
her
whom
they
love
best
each
man
fashioning
for
himself
from
his
own
chosen
model
her
whom
he
calls
his
princess
yet
it
may
be
that
for
some
of
them
who
so
truly
loved
her
her
heart
had
a
tenderness
who
shall
tell
all
the
dreams
that
come
and
go
the
promptings
and
stirrings
of
a
vagrant
inclination
and
who
would
pry
too
closely
into
these
secret
matters
may
we
not
more
properly
give
thanks
to
heaven
that
the
thing
is
as
it
is
for
surely
it
makes
greatly
for
the
increase
of
joy
and
entertainment
in
the
world
and
of
courtesy
and
true
tenderness
that
the
heart
of
princess
osra
or
of
what
lady
you
may
choose
sir
to
call
by
her
name
should
flutter
in
pretty
hesitation
here
and
there
and
to
and
fro
a
little
before
it
flies
on
a
straight
wing
to
its
destined
and
desired
home
and
if
you
be
not
the
prince
for
your
princess
why
sir
your
case
is
a
sad
one
yet
there
have
been
many
such
and
still
there
is
laughter
as
well
as
tears
in
the
tune
to
which
the
world
spins
round
but
still
a
ruby
kindles
in
the
vine
and
many
a
garden
by
the
water
blows
wear
your
willow
then
as
the
marquis
de
m√©rosailles
wore
his
lightly
and
yet
most
courteously
or
like
the
bishop
of
modenstein
for
so
some
say
with
courage
and
that
is
if
wear
it
you
must
you
remember
what
the
miller
of
hofbau
thought
an
interesting
announcement
the
most
important
work
from
the
pen
of
anthony
hope
since
the
publication
of
the
prisoner
of
zenda
is
to
be
entitled
phroso
and
is
to
be
issued
early
in
illustration
it
is
of
the
same
general
nature
as
the
prisoner
of
zenda
but
surpasses
the
latter
in
many
respects
illustration
the
hero
is
a
young
english
lord
of
a
man
of
the
same
stamp
as
rudolph
rassendyl
while
the
heroine
is
the
lady
euphrosyne
phroso
of
neopolia
and
more
than
equals
flavia
in
courage
interest
and
charm
illustration
weschler
has
spent
nearly
a
year
upon
the
numerous
illustrations
working
from
the
model
and
making
use
of
a
collection
of
greek
costumes
weapons
illustration
the
book
will
be
published
at

will
be
well
printed
and
bound

an
extraordinary
success
is
