and

new

and

in
to
the
reader
when
this
book
first
came
to
my
mind
it
came
as
a
history
and
theory
of
the
building
of
magic
cities
on
tables
with
bricks
and
toys
and
little
things
such
as
a
child
may
find
and
use
but
as
i
kept
the
thought
by
me
it
grew
and
changed
as
thoughts
will
do
until
at
last
it
took
shape
as
an
attempt
to
contribute
something
however
small
and
unworthy
to
the
science
of
building
a
magic
city
in
the
soul
of
a
child
a
city
built
of
all
things
pure
and
fine
and
beautiful
as
you
read
it
will
i
hope
seem
to
you
that
something
of
what
i
say
is
true
in
much
no
doubt
it
will
seem
to
you
that
i
am
mistaken
but
however
you
may
disagree
with
me
you
will
i
trust
at
least
have
faith
in
the
honesty
of
my
purpose
if
i
seem
to
you
to
be
too
dogmatic
to
lay
down
the
law
too
much
as
though
i
were
the
teacher
and
you
the
learner
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
it
is
in
no
such
spirit
that
i
have
written
rather
it
is
as
though
you
and
i
spending
a
quiet
evening
by
your
fire
talked
together
of
the
things
that
matter
and
as
though
i
laid
before
you
all
the
things
that
were
in
my
heart
not
stopping
at
every
turn
to
say
do
you
not
think
so
too
and
i
hope
you
agree
with
me
but
telling
you
straight
from
the
heart
what
i
have
felt
and
thought
and
i
humbly
say
known
about
children
and
the
needs
of
children
i
have
talked
to
you
as
to
a
friend
without
the
reservations
and
apologies
which
we
use
with
strangers
and
if
in
anything
i
shall
have
offended
you
i
entreat
you
to
extend
to
me
the
forgiveness
and
the
forbearance
which
you
would
exercise
towards
a
friend
who
had
offended
you
not
meaning
to
offend
and
to
believe
that
i
have
spoken
to
you
as
frankly
and
plainly
as
i
would
wish
you
to
speak
to
me

chapter
i
of
understanding
it
is
not
with
any
pretension
to
special
knowledge
of
my
subject
that
i
set
out
to
write
down
what
i
know
about
children
i
have
no
special
means
of
knowing
anything
i
do
in
fact
know
nothing
that
can
not
be
known
by
any
one
who
will
go
to
the
only
fount
of
knowledge
experience
and
by
experience
i
do
not
mean
scientific
experience
that
is
the
recorded
results
of
experiments
the
tabulated
knowledge
wrung
from
observation
i
mean
personal
experience
that
is
to
say
memory
you
may
observe
the
actions
of
children
and
chronicle
their
sayings
and
produce
from
these
perhaps
a
lifelike
sketch
of
a
child
as
it
appears
to
the
observer
but
observation
is
no
key
to
the
inner
mysteries
of
a
child
soul
the
only
key
to
those
mysteries
is
in
knowledge
the
knowledge
of
what
you
yourself
felt
when
you
were
good
and
little
and
a
child
you
can
remember
how
things
looked
to
you
and
how
things
looked
to
the
other
children
who
were
your
intimates
our
own
childhood
besides
furnishing
us
with
an
exhaustless
store
of
enlightening
memories
furnishes
us
with
the
one
opportunity
of
our
lives
for
the
observation
of
children
other
children
there
is
a
freemasonry
between
children
a
spontaneous
confidence
and
which
is
and
must
be
for
ever
impossible
between
children
and
no
matter
how
sympathetic
the
how
confiding
the
child
between
the
child
and
the
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
and
this
gulf
the
gulf
between
one
generation
and
another
can
never
be
really
bridged
you
may
learn
to
see
across
it
a
little
or
sometimes
in
rare
cases
to
lean
very
far
across
it
so
that
you
can
just
touch
the
tips
of
the
little
fingers
held
out
from
the
other
side
but
if
your
dealings
with
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
gulf
are
to
be
just
generous
noble
and
helpful
they
must
be
motived
and
coloured
by
your
memories
of
the
time
when
you
yourself
were
on
the
other
side
when
you
were
a
child
full
of
your
own
hopes
dreams
aims
interests
instincts
and
imaginings
and
over
against
you
kindly
perhaps
tenderly
loving
often
tenderly
loved
but
still
in
some
mysterious
way
antagonistic
and
counting
as
them
were
the
i
might
say
elders
parents
teachers
spiritual
pastors
and
masters
but
the
word
which
the
child
himself
uses
seems
to
me
for
all
reasons
to
be
the
best
word
for
my
use
because
it
expresses
fully
and
finally
the
nature
of
the
gulf
between
the
are
the
people
who
once
were
children
and
who
have
forgotten
what
it
felt
like
to
be
a
child
and
time
marks
with
the
same
outward
brand
those
who
have
forgotten
and
those
who
do
not
forget
so
that
even
the
few
who
have
managed
to
slip
past
the
with
their
bundle
of
memories
intact
can
never
fully
display
them
these
are
a
sort
of
contraband
and
neither
the
children
nor
the
will
ever
believe
that
that
which
we
have
brought
with
us
from
the
land
of
childhood
is
genuine
the
accuse
us
of
invention
sometimes
praise
us
for
it
when
all
we
have
is
memory
and
the
children
imagine
that
we
must
have
been
watching
them
and
thus
surprised
a
few
of
their
secrets
when
all
that
we
have
is
the
secrets
which
were
our
own
when
we
were
children
secrets
which
were
so
bound
up
with
the
fibre
of
our
nature
that
we
could
never
lose
them
and
so
go
through
life
with
them
our
dearest
treasures
such
people
feel
to
the
end
that
they
are
children
in
a
world
for
a
gentleman
with
a
beard
or
a
stout
elderly
lady
with
spectacles
to
move
among
other
elderly
and
spectacled
persons
feeling
that
they
are
still
children
and
that
the
other
elderly
and
spectacled
ones
are
really
seems
thoroughly
unreasonable
and
therefore
those
who
have
never
forgotten
do
not
as
a
rule
say
anything
about
it
they
just
mingle
with
the
other
people
looking
as
as
any
one
but
in
their
hearts
they
are
only
pretending
to
be
it
is
like
acting
in
a
charade
time
with
his
box
of
lines
and
wrinkles
his
skilful
brush
that
paints
out
the
tints
and
the
contours
of
youth
his
supply
of
grey
wigs
and
rounded
shoulders
and
pillows
for
the
waist
disguises
the
actors
well
enough
and
they
go
through
life
altogether
unsuspected
the
tired
eyes
close
on
a
world
which
to
them
has
always
been
the
child
world
the
tired
hands
loose
the
earthly
possessions
which
have
to
them
been
ever
the
toys
of
the
child
and
deep
in
their
hearts
is
the
faith
and
the
hope
that
in
the
life
to
come
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
pretend
to
be
such
people
as
these
are
never
pessimists
though
they
may
be
sinners
and
they
will
be
trusting
to
the
verge
of
what
a
real
would
call
imbecility
to
them
the
world
will
be
from
first
to
last
a
beautiful
place
and
every
unbeautiful
thing
will
be
a
surprise
hurting
them
like
a
sudden
blow
they
will
never
learn
prudence
or
parsimony
nor
know
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
the
really
the
things
that
are
or
are
not
done
by
the
best
people
all
their
lives
they
will
love
and
expect
love
and
be
sad
wondering
helplessly
when
they
do
not
get
it
they
will
expect
beautiful
quixotic
impulsive
generosities
and
splendours
from
a
world
which
has
forgotten
what
impulse
was
and
to
the
very
end
they
will
not
leave
off
expecting
they
will
be
easily
pleased
and
easily
hurt
and
the
in
grain
will
contemplate
their
pains
and
their
pleasures
with
an
uncomprehending
irritation
if
these
children
disguised
by
bodies
are
ever
recognised
for
what
they
are
it
is
when
they
happen
to
have
the
use
of
their
pens
when
they
write
for
and
about
children
then
people
will
call
them
intelligent
and
observant
and
children
will
write
to
them
and
ask
the
question
how
did
you
know
for
if
they
can
become
articulate
they
will
speak
the
language
that
children
understand
and
children
will
love
not
them
for
their
identity

cloaked
with
grey
but
what
they
say
there
are
some
of
these
in
whom
the
fire
of
genius
burns
up
and
licks
away
the
trappings
under
which

to
disguise

such

these
and
the

knows
them
for
what
they

it

haltingly

with
all
the
power
of
the
heart
against
education
against
the
instruction
which
crams
a
child
with
facts
and
starves
it
of
dreams
which
forces
the
free
foot
into
heavy
boots
and
bids
it
walk
on
narrow
pavement
which
crushes
with
heavy
hand

the

new
ways
what
we
ask
with
anxious
gravity
what
is
the
best
sort
of
teaching
for
children
one
might
as
sanely
ask
what
is
the
best
sort
of
spectacles
for
men
or
the
best
size
in
gloves
for
women
and
the
blind
coarse
generalisation
which
underlies
that
question
is
the
very
heart
and
core
of
the
muddled
musty
maze
we
call
education
we
talk
of
the
best
sort
of
education
for
children
as
we
might
talk
of
the
best
sort
of
polish
for
stoves
the
best
sort
of
nourishment
for
mice
stoves
are
all
alike
they
vary
in
ugliness
perhaps
but
the
iron
soul
of
one
is
as
the
iron
soul
of
the
other
the
polish
that
is
good
for
one
is
good
for
all
mice
may
and
do
vary
in
size
and
colour
their
mousehood
does
not
vary
nor
their
taste
for
cheese
in
the
inner
nature
in
the
soul
and
self
of
it
each
child
is
different
from
any
other
child
and
the
education
that
treats
children
as
a
class
and
not
as
individual
human
beings
is
the
education
whose
failure
is
bringing
our
civilisation
about
our
ears
even
as
we
speak
each
child
is
an
explorer
in
a
new
country
an
explorer
with
its
own
special
needs
and
curiosities
we
put
up
iron
railings
to
keep
the
explorers
to
our
own
sordidly
asphalted
paths
the
little
free
wild
creatures
would
seek
their
meat
from
god
we
round
them
into
herds
pen
them
in
folds
and
feed
them
with
artificial
foods
drab
flat
oil
cakes
all
alike
not
considering
that
for
some
brown
nuts
and
red
berries
and
for
some
the
new
clean
green
grass
may
be
the
bread
of
life
or
if
you
take
the
mind
of
a
child
to
be
a
garden
wherein
flowers
grow
that
might
be
trained
to
beauty
you
bring
along
your
and
crush
everything
to
a

you
may
grow

it
is
so
good

the
field
you
say
because
you
like

liberty
is
one
of
the
rights
we
claim
for
ourselves
though
god
knows
we
get
little
enough
of
it
and
use
still
less
and
liberty
is
one
of
the
rights
that
a
child
above
all
needs
every
possible
liberty
of
thought
of
word
of
deed
the
old
systems
of
education
seem
to
have
found
it
good
to
coerce
a
child
for
the
simple
sake
of
coercion
to
make
it
do
what
the
master
chose
to
make
it
leave
undone
those
things
which
it
wished
to
do
and
to
do
those
things
which
it
did
not
wish
to
do
nay
more
wished
violently
and
conclusively
not
to
do
to
force
the
choice
of
the
teacher
on
the
child
to
override
the
timid
natural
impulses
of
the
child
with
the
hard
hoofs
of
the
teacher
individuality
to
crush
out
all
initiative
to
force
the
young
supple
mind
into
a
mould
to
lop
the
budding
branches
nip
off
the
sensitive
seeking
tendrils
to
batter
down
the
child
will
by
the
brute
force
of
the
will
to
break
the
child
spirit
as
the
cursed
phrase
used
to
run
this
was
in
effect
what
education
meant
there
was
a
picture
in
i
remember
at
least
i
have
forgotten
the
picture
but
i
remember
the
legend
cissy
go
and
see
what
bobbie
doing
and
tell
him
not
to
it
did
not
much
matter
what
you
made
a
child
do
so
long
as
it
was
something
against
the
grain
he
was
to
learn
not
what
he
with
his
wonderful
new
curiosities
and
aptitudes
longed
to
learn
but
what
you
wished
to
teach
you
with
your
dulled
senses
dulled
in
the
same
bitter
school
as
that
in
which
he
was
now
a
sad
learner
illustration
not
much
higher
than
the
table
generation
after
generation
has
gone
on
pounding
away
at
the
old
silly
game
each
generation
anxious
and
eager
to
hurt
the
new
one
as
it
in
its
time
was
hurt
each
generation
must
one
would
have
thought
have
remembered
what
things
hurt
children
and
how
much
these
things
hurt
and
yet
this
intolerable
cycle
of
bullying
and
punishment
and
repression
went
on
and
on
and
on
children
were
bullied
and
broken
and
grew
up
to
bully
and
break
in
their
turn
it
must
be
that
this
was
because
the
did
not
remember
those
who
have
the
care
of
children
who
work
for
them
who
teach
them
should
be
those
who
do
remember
those
who
have
not
forgotten
what
it
feels
like
to
be
a
child
any
sort
of
child
for
though
children
are
all
different
there
is
a
common
measure
among
them
as
there
is
among
men
a
law
for
men
can
not
be
good
if
it
be
made
as
indeed
but
too
often
happens
by
those
who
have
forgotten
what
it
used
to
feel
like
to
be
a
man
and
what
sort
of
poetry
do
you
get
from
one
who
has
forgotten
beauty
and
sorrow
and
the
spring
and
how
it
feels
to
be
young
and
a
lover
and
if
the
people
who
have
the
care
of
children
have
forgotten
what
it
feels
like
to
be
a
child
those
who
do
remember
should
remind
them
they
should
be
reminded
how
it
feels
to
be
not
so
very
much
higher
than
the
table
how
it
feels
not
to
be
so
clever
as
you
are
now
and
so
much
more
interested
in
so
much
more
how
it
feels
to
believe
in
things
and
in
people
as
you
did
when
you
were
new
to
the
journey
of
life
to
explore
every
road
you
came
to
to
trust
every
person
you
met
it
is
a
long
time
ago
but
can
you
not
remember
the
days
when
right
and
wrong
were
as
different
as
milk
and
mud
when
you
knew
that
it
was
really
wrong
to
be
naughty
and
really
good
to
be
good
when
you
felt
that
your
mother
could
do
no
wrong
and
that
your
father
was
the
noblest
and
bravest
of
men
do
you
remember
the
world
of
small
and
new
and
joyous
and
delightful
things
try
to
remember
it
if
you
would
know
how
to
help
a
child
instead
of
hindering
it
try
to
look
at
the
world
with
the
clear
clean
eyes
that
once
were
yours
in
the
days
when
you
had
never
read
a
newspaper
or
deceived
a
friend
you
will
then
be
able
to
see
again
certain
ideals
unclouded
and
radiant
which
the
dust
of
the
crowded
highway
and
the
smears
of
have
dimmed
and
distorted
quite
simple
ideals
of
love
faith
unselfishness
honour
truth
i
know
these
words
are
often
enough
on
the
lips
of
all
of
us
but
a
child
ear
will
be
able
to
tell
whether
the
words
spring
from
the
lips
or
the
heart
look
back
and
you
will
see
that
you
yourself
were
also
able
to
distinguish
these
things
once
education
as
it
should
be
the
unfolding
of
a
flower
not
the
distorting
of
it
is
only
possible
to
those
who
are
willing
and
able
themselves
to
become
as
little
children
it
is
because
certain
great
spirits
have
done
this
and
have
tried
to
teach
others
to
do
it
that
reforms
in
education
have
begun
to
be
at
least
possible
froebel
pestalozzi
signora
montessori
and
many
a
lesser
star
has
shone
upon
a
new
path
and
public
interest
has
centred
more
and
more
on
the
welfare
of
the
child
books
are
written
societies
formed
newspapers
founded
in
the
interests
of
the
child
and
true
education
becomes
a
possibility
and
well
indeed
it
is
for
us
that
this
is
so
for
the
education
of
the
last
three
hundred
years
has
led
in
all
things
vital
and
spiritual
downhill
all
the
way
we
have
gone
on
frustrating
natural
human
intelligences
and
emotions
inculcating
false
doctrines
and
choking
with
incoherent
facts
the
souls
which
asked
to
be
fed
with
till
now
our
civilisation
is
a
thing
we
can
not
look
at
without
a
mental
and
moral
nausea
we
have
in
our
countrysides
peasants
too
broken
for
rebellion
in
our
cities
the
mortal
sickness
of
a
mind
too
unhappy
to
be
kind
if
ever
we
are
to
be
able
to
look
ourselves
and
each
other
in
the
face
again
it
will
be
because
a
new
generation
has
arisen
in
whose
ears
the
voice
of
god
and
his
angels
has
not
ceased
to
sound
if
only
we
would
see
the
things
that
belong
to
our
peace
and
lead
the
children
instead
of
driving
them
who
knows
what
splendid
thoughts
and
actions
they
in
their
natural
development
might
bring
to
the
salvation
of
the
world
in
the
palace
of
education
which
the
great
minds
have
designed
and
are
designing
many
stones
will
be
needed
and
so
i
bring
the
little
stone
i
have
hewn
out
and
tried
to
shape
in
the
hope
that
it
may
fit
into
a
corner
of
that
great
edifice
for
if
anything
is
to
be
done
it
is
necessary
that
all
who
have
anything
to
give
shall
give
it
as
francis
bacon
said
nothing
can
so
much
conduce
to
the
drawing
down
as
it
were
from
heaven
a
whole
shower
of
new
and
profitable
inventions
as
this
that
the
experiments
of
many
may
come
to
the
knowledge
of
one
man
or
some
few
who
by
mutual
conference
may
whet
and
sharpen
one
another
so
that
by
this
arts
may
flourish
and
as
it
were
by
a
commixture
and
communication
of
rays
inflame
one
another
this
sagacity
by
literate
experience
may
in
the
mean
project
and
scatter
for
the
benefit
of
man
many
rudiments
to
knowledge
which
may
be
had
at
hand
and
that
is
why
i
have
left
for
a
little
while
the
telling
of
stories
and
set
myself
to
write
down
something
of
what
i
know
about
children
know
by
the
grace
of
memory
and
by
the
dreams
of
childhood
to
me
thank
god
persistent
and
imperishable
chapter
iii
playthings
the
prime
instinct
of
a
child
at
play
i
do
not
mean
a
child
at
games
is
to
create
i
use
the
word
confidently
he
will
make
as
well
as
create
if
you
let
him
but
always
he
will
create
he
will
use
the
whole
force
of
dream
and
fancy
to
create
something
out
of
nothing
over
and
beyond
what
he
will
make
out
of
such
materials
as
he
has
to
hand
the
will
lay
a
dozen
wooden
bricks
and
four
cotton
reels
together
set
a
broken
cup
on
the
top
of
them
and
tell
you
it
is
a
and
it
is
he
has
created
the
engine
which
he
sees
and
you
do
see
and
the
pile
of
bricks
and
cotton
reels
is
the
symbol
of
his
creation
he
will
silently
borrow
your
best
scissors
and
cut
a
serrated
band
of
newspaper
which
he
will
fasten
round
his
head
with
your
best
brooch
if
he
can
not
find
a
pin
hang
another
newspaper
from
his
shoulders
and
sit
in
state
holding
the
he
will
tell
you
that
he
is
a
king
and
he
is
he
has
created
crown
robes
sceptre
and
kingship
the
paper
and
the
rest
of
it
are
but
symbols
illustration
he
has
created
the
engine
and
you
shall
observe
that
the
toys
which
the
child
loves
best
are
always
those
toys
which
lend
themselves
to
such
symbolic
use
illustration
the
tomb
in
the
desert
christmas
is
at
hand
you
go
to
buy
gifts
for
the
child
in
memory
of
that
other
child
whose
birthday
gifts
were
gold
frankincense
and
myrrh
you
go
into
the
toyshops
elbowing
your
way
as
best
you
can
looking
for
such
toys
as
may
aid
the
child
in
his
work
of
creative
imagination
you
find
a
vast
mass
and
litter
and
jumble
of
incredible
futilities
things
made
to
sell
things
made
by
people
who
have
forgotten
what
it
is
like
to
be
a
child
mechanical
toys
of
all
sorts
stupid
toys
toys
that
will
only
do
one
thing
and
that
thing
vulgar
and
foolish
and
worst
outrage
of
all
ugly
toys
monstrosities
deformities
lead
devils
grinning
humpbacked
clowns
comic
dogs
and
cats
hideous
pigs
incredible
negroes
intolerable
golliwogs
all
such
things
the
natural
child
with
a
child
decent
detestation
of
deformity
will
thrust
from
it
with
screams
of
fear
and
hatred
till
the
materialistic
mother
or
nurse
explains
that
the
horror
is
not
really
as
the
child
knows
it
to
be
horrible
and
unnatural
but
funny
thus
do
we
outrage
the
child
inborn
sense
of
beauty
which
is
also
the
sense
of
health
and
fitness
and
teach
it
that
deformity
is
not
shocking
not
pitiable
even
but
just
funny
all
these
ugly
toys
are
impossible
as
aids
to
clean
imagination
so
almost
in
as
great
though
not
in
so
harmful
a
degree
is
the
character
doll
the
old
doll
was
a
doll
and
not
a
character
therefore
she
could
assume
any
character
at
your
choice
the
character
doll
is
baby
willy
and
can
never
be
anything
else
unless
imagination
exasperated
and
baffled
christens
him
silly
billy
in
the
moment
of
furious
projection
across
the
nursery
floor
but
the
old
doll
with
her
good
expressionless
face
and
clear
blue
eyes
could
be
a
duchess
or
a
dairymaid
a
captive
princess
or
a
greengrocer
wife
keeping
shop
a
cruel
stepmother
or
joan

arc
i
beg
you
to
try
baby
willy
in
the
character
of
joan
of
arc
you
can
not
hope
to
understand
children
by
by
reason
by
logic
nor
by
any
science
whatsoever
you
can
not
understand
them
by
imagination
not
even
by
love
itself
there
is
only
one
way
to
remember
what
you
thought
and
felt
and
liked
and
hated
when
you
yourself
were
a
child
not
what
you
know
now
or
think
you
know
you
ought
to
have
thought
and
liked
but
what
you
did
then
in
stark
fact
like
and
think
there
is
no
other
way
do
you
remember
the
toys
you
liked
the
toys
you
played
with
do
you
remember
the
toys
you
hated
after
the
fading
of
the
first
day
flush
of
novelty
of
possession
the
houses
with
doors
that
would
open
the
stables
with
horses
that
would
stand
up
the
shops
whose
goods
were
part
of
their
painted
shelves
whose
shopmen
were
as
fast
glued
behind
the
counter
as
any
live
before
the
passing
of
the
shops
act
and
the
mechanical
toys
the
clockwork
toys
the
engine
was
all
right
even
after
the
clockwork
ran
down
for
the
last
time
with
that
inexorable
whizz
which
told
you
all
was
over
you
could
build
tunnels
with
the
big
brown
books
in
the
library
and
push
the
engine
through
with
your
hand
it
would
run
quite
a
long
way
out
on
the
other
side
but
the
other
clockwork
things
how
can
one
love
and
pet
a
mouse
no
matter
how
furry
its
superficial
exterior
when
underneath
where
its
soft
waistcoat
and
its
little
feet
should
be
there
is
only
a
hard
surface
from
which
incompetent
wheels
protrude
and
the
ostrich
who
draws
a
hansom
cab
and
the
man
who
beats
the
boy
with
a
stick
when
they
have
whizzed
their
last
who
cares
for
the
tin
relics
outliving
their
detestable
activities
think
of
the
toys
you
liked
the
noah
ark
full
of
characters
what
stirring
dramas
of
the
chase
what
sporting
incidents
what
domestic
and
agricultural
operations
could
be
carried
out
with
that
most
royal
of
toys
noah
i
remember
was
equally
competent
and
convincing
as
ploughman
or
carter
but
his
chief
rôle
was
sitting
bull
his
sons
were
inimitable
as
chingachgook
and
scalp
hunters
generally
you
can
not
play
scalp
hunters
with
the
mechanical
ostrich
indissolubly
welded
to
a

cab

stonehenge
you
loved
your
bricks
i
think
especially
if
you
lived
in
the
days
when
bricks
were
of
oak
heavy
firm
exactly
proportioned
before
the
boxes
of
inexact
light
deal
bricks
with
the
one
painted
glass
window
began
to
be

how
finely
those

how
submissively
anna
the
dutch
doll
whose

gone
played
the

toys

the
one
supreme
quality
of
a
good
toy
let
it

a
toy
that

itself

can
in

sense
play
with
chapter
iv
imagination
to
the
child
from
the
beginning
life
is
the
unfolding
of
one
vast
mystery
to
him
our
stalest
commonplaces
are
great
news
our
dullest
facts
prismatic
wonders
to
the
baby
who
has
never
seen
a
red
ball
a
red
ball
is
a
marvel
new
and
magnificent
as
ever
the
golden
apples
were
to
hercules
you
show
the
child
many
things
all
strange
all
entrancing
it
sees
it
hears
it
touches
it
learns
to
sight
and
touch
and
hearing
you
tell
it
tales
of
the
things
it
can
not
see
and
hear
and
touch
of
men
that
it
may
never
meet
of
lands
that
it
shall
never
see
strange
black
and
brown
and
yellow
people
whose
dress
is
not
the
dress
of
mother
or
nurse
strange
glowing
yellow
lands
where
the
sun
burns
like
fire
and
flowers
grow
that
are
not
like
the
flowers
in
the
fields
at
home
you
tell
it
that
the
stars
which
look
like
in
the
floor
of
heaven
are
really
great
lonely
worlds
millions
of
miles
away
that
the
earth
which
the
child
can
see
for
itself
to
be
flat
is
really
round
that
nuts
fall
from
the
trees
because
of
the
force
of
gravitation
and
not
as
reason
would
suggest
merely
because
there
is
nothing
to
hold
them
up
and
the
child
believes
it
believes
all
the
seeming
miracles
then
you
tell
it
of
other
things
no
more
miraculous
and
no
less
of
fairies
and
dragons
and
enchantments
of
spells
and
magic
of
flying
carpets
and
invisible
swords
the
child
believes
in
these
wonders
likewise
why
not
if
very
big
men
live
in
patagonia
why
should
not
very
little
men
live
in
if
electricity
can
move
unseen
through
the
air
why
not
carpets
the
child
memory
becomes
a
of
beautiful
and
wonderful
things
which
are
or
have
been
in
the
visible
universe
or
in
that
greater
universe
the
mind
of
man
life
will
teach
the
child
soon
enough
to
distinguish
between
the
two
but
there
are
those
who
are
not
as
you
and
i
these
say
that
all
the
enchanting
fairy
romances
are
lies
that
nothing
is
real
that
can
not
be
measured
or
weighed
seen
or
heard
or
handled
such
make
their
idols
of
stocks
and
stones
and
are
blind
and
deaf
to
the
things
of
the
spirit
these
materialists
crush
the
beautiful
butterfly
wings
of
imagination
insisting
that
pork
and
pews
and
are
more
real
than
poetry
that
a
is
more
real
than
love
a
viper
than
valour
these
gradgrinds
give
to
the
children
the
stones
which
they
call
facts
and
deny
to
the
little
ones
the
daily
bread
of
dreams
of
the
immeasurable
value
of
imagination
as
a
means
to
the
development
of
the
loveliest
virtues
to
the
uprooting
of
the
ugliest
and
meanest
sins
there
is
here
no
space
to
speak
but
the
gain
in
sheer
happiness
is
more
quickly
set
forth
imagination
duly
fostered
and
trained
is
to
the
world
of
visible
wonder
and
beauty
what
the
inner
light
is
to
the
japanese

do
not
attempt
to
explain
it
but
there
is
a
certain
quality
in
men
who
have
taken
root
who
have
lived
with
the
same
furniture
the
same
house
the
same
friends
for
many
years
which
you
shall
look
for
in
vain
in
men
who
have
travelled

over
and
met
hundreds

you
do

it

be
deep
the

way
i
take
it
that
a
constant
succession
of
new
clothes
is
irritating
and
unsettling
especially
to
women
it
fritters
away
the
attention
and
exacerbates
their
natural
frivolity

days

clothes
were
expensive

bought
few
clothes

those
clothes
were
meant
to
last

one
to
be
almost
weekly
settled
tends
to
calm
the
nerves
and
consolidate
the
character
clothes
are
very
cheap
now
therefore
women
buy
many
new
dresses
and
throw
the
shoddy
things
away

as
they
soon
do
they
grow

men
are

more

man
knows
the
appeal
of

old
coat
so
long
as
women
are
insensible
to
the
appeal
of
an
old
gown
they
need
never
hope
to
be
considered
in
stability

character
the

the
passion
for
ornaments

another
of
the
unsettling
factors
in
an

age
the
very
existence
of
the
fancy

not
only
a
menace
to
but
an
attack
on
the
quiet
dignity
in
the
home
the
hundreds
of
ugly
twisted
bizarre
fancy
articles
which
replace
the
old
few
serious
ornaments
are
all
so
many
tokens
of
the
spirit
of
unrest
which
is
born
of
and
in
turn
bears
our
modern
civilisation
it
is
not
alas
presently
possible
for
us
as
a
nation
to
return
to
that
calmer
more
dignified
state
when
the
lives
of
men
were
rooted
in
their
individual
possessions
possessions
adorned
with
memories
of
the
past

cherished
as
legacies
to
the

i
wish
i
could
persuade
women
to
buy
good
gowns
and
grow
fond
of
them
to
buy
good
chairs
and
tables
and
to
refrain
from
the
orgy
of
the
fancy

much
of

with

array

for
which
the
last
harvest
of
the
same
empty
husks
is
thrust
aside
in
the
bottom
of
the
toy
cupboard
and
in
a
couple
of
days
most
of
the
flimsy
stuff
is
broken
and
the
child
is
weary
to
death
of
it
all
if
he
has
any
real
toys
he
will
leave
the
glittering
trash
for
nurse
to
put
away
and
go
back

real
toys

i
was
a
child
in
the
nursery
we
had
there
were
three
of
us

large
rocking
horse
a
large

with

box
as
annexe
a

a
great
chest
of
oak
bricks
and
a
pestle
and

i
can
not
remember
any
other
toys
that
pleased
us
dolls
came
and
went
but
they
were
not
toys
they
were
characters
and
now
and
then
something
of
a
clockwork
nature
strayed
our
way
to
be
broken
up
and
disembowelled
to
meet
the
mechanical
needs
of
the
moment
i
remember
a
desperate
hour
when
i
found
that
the
walking
doll
from
paris
had
clockwork
under
her
crinoline
and
could
not
be
comfortably
taken
to
bed
i
had
a
china
rabbit
who
was
hard
enough
in
all
conscience
but
then
he
never
pretended
to
be
anything
but
a
china
rabbit
and
i
bought
him
with
my
own
penny
at
sandhurst
fair
he
slept
with
me
for
seven
or
eight
years
and
when
he
was
lost
with
my
and
the
rest
of
its
loved
contents
on
the
journey
from
france
to
england
all
the
dignity
of
my
thirteen
years
could
not
uphold
me
in
that
tragedy
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
children
are
naturally
fond
of
change
they
love
what
they
know
in
strange
places
they
suffer
violently
from
even
when
their
loved
nurse
or
mother
is
with
them
they
want
to
get
back
to
the
house

know
the
toys
they
know
the
books
they
know
and
the
loves
of
children
for
their
toys
especially
the
ones
they
take
to

with
them

be

respected

was

after
which
nurse
put
in
her
features
again
with
a
quill
pen
and
consoled
me
for
any
change
in
her
expression
by
explaining
that
she
was
growing
up
my
little
son
had
a
mouse
and
has
it
still
the
fewer
toys
a
child
has
the
more
he
will
value
them
and
it
is
important
that
a
child
should
value
his
toys
if
he
is
to
begin
to
get
out
of
them
their
value
if
his
choice
of
objects
be
limited
he
will
use
his
imagination
and
ingenuity
in
making
the
objects
available
serve
the
purposes
of
such
plays
as
he
has
in
hand
also
it
is
well
to
remember
that
the
supplementing
of
a
child
own
toys
by
other
things
for
a
has
considerable
educational
value
the
child
will
learn
quite
easily
that
the
difference
between
his
and
yours
is
not
a
difference
between
the
attainable
and
the
unattainable
but
between
the
constant
possession
and
the
occasional
possession
he
will
also
learn
to
take
care
of
the
things
which
are
lent
to
him
and
if
he
sees
that
you
respect
his
possessions
will
respect
yours
all
the
more
in
that
some
of
them
are
now
and
then
for
a
time
and
in
a
sense

illustration
the
turquoise

the
generosity
of

and

be

discouraged

equipment
can

added

not
by
the
sporadic
outbursts
of
unclish
extravagance
but
by
and
slow
degrees
and
by
means
in
which
the
child
participates
for
we
must
never
forget
that
the
child
loves
both
in
imagination
and
in
fact
to
create
all
his
dreams
his
innocent
pretendings
and
will
help
his
nature
to
unfold

his
hands
in
their
clumsy
efforts
will
help
the

with
us
we
have
grown
uglier
and
the
things
which
amuse
no
longer
teach
for
a
good
many
years
now
more
than
three
hundred
old
men
have
said
such
things
and
such
were
better
in
our
time
and
always
the
young
have
disbelieved
the
saying
which
in
due
course
came
from
their
own
lips
has
it
ever
occurred
to
any
one
that
the
reason
why
old
people
say
this
is
quite
the
simplest
of
all
reasons
they
say
it
because
it
is
and
true
in
our
land
in
quite
a
special
manner
the
chariot
wheels
of
advancing
civilisation
must
always
furrow
some
green
fields
grind
some
fair
flowers
in
the
dust
but
the
chariot
wheels
in
which
civilisation
advances
grows
less
and
less
like
a
chariot
and
more
and
more
like
a
and
unless
we
steer
better
there
will
very
soon
be
few
flowers
left
to
us
those
of
us
who
have
reached
middle
age
already
see
that
the
old
men
spoke
truly
things
are
not
what
they
were
without
dealing
with
frauds
and
adulterations
and
shoddy
of
all
sorts
we
can
see
that
things
are
not
so
good
as
they
were
nor
yet
so
beautiful
and
i
do
not
think
that
this
means
just
that
we
are
growing
old
and
that
the
fingers
of
time
have
rubbed
the
bloom
from
the
fruit
of
life
because
those
things
which
must
be
now
as
they
used
to
be
trees
leaves
rivers
and
the
laughter
of
little
children
flowers
the
sea
at
those
points
where
piers
are
impracticable
and
mountains
the
ones
stony
and
steep
enough
to
resist
the
and
the
funicular
railway
still
hold
all
and
more
than
all
their
old
magic
and
delight
it
seems
that
it
is
not
only
that
the
ugly
and
unmeaning
things
have
grown
like
a
filthy
fungus
over
the
sheer
beauty
of
the
world
but
that
the
things
that
people
mean
to
be
beautiful
are
not
beautiful
and
the
things
they
mean
to
be
interesting
lack
interest
and
the
disease
is
universal
it
attacks
new
things
as
well
as
old
the
cinematographs
even
newest
of
the
new
as
things
went
in
the
old
world
already
the
canker
has
eaten
them
up
in
the
first
year
of
picture
palaces
we
all
crowded
to
see
beautiful
pictures
of
beautiful
places
niagara
the
zambesi
falls
the
grand
cañon
the
comic
pieces
were
perhaps
french
but
they
were
certainly
funny
also
we
saw
the
way
the
world
lived
when
it
was
the
other
side
of
the
world
elephants
teak
naked
savages
or
as
near
naked
as
do
matter
moving
in
ceremonial
dance
before
the
idols
that
were
the
gods
of
their
deep
dangerous
faith
dramas
of
love
and
death
and
pity
and
poverty
quite
often
in
the
early
days
the
cinematograph
tale
was
of
some
workman
driven
by
want
to
the
theft
of
a
loaf
it
is
true
that
the
story
generally
ended
in
his
conviction
and
the
adoption
of
his
charming
baby
girl
by
the
wife
of
the
but
all
the
same
people
saw
some
one
poor
and
sad
and
tempted
and
were
sorry
and
sad
for
his
sake
also
we
had
tales
of
indians
with
men
that
rode
amain
and
horses
that
one
longed
to
bestride
such
beauties
they
were
all
fire
and
delicate
strong
temperament
war
dramas
too
there
were
where
the
hero
left
his
sweetheart
and
turned
coward
perhaps
redeeming
himself
with
magnificent
completeness
in
the
splendid
of
a
forlorn
hope
that
is
all
over
already
the
sordid
heavy
hand
that
smears
commercial
commonplace
on
all
the
bright
facets
of
romance
has
obscured
the
vivid
possibilities
of
the
cinematograph
we
have
now
for
fun
the
elaborate
hurting
of
one
american
person
by
another
american
person
for
scenery
american
buildings
for
romance
the
incredibly
unimportant
emotions
of
fleshy
american
actresses
and
actors
there
are
two
girls
good
and
bad
two
men
bad
and
good
in
the
end
the
good
man
gets
the
good
girl
which
is
of
course
as
it
should
be
or
would
be
if
we
could
believe
in
any
moral
quality
in
these
impersonators
you
care
a
bit
who
wins
but
none
the
less
the
four
of
them
mouth
and
mop
and
mow
and
make
faces
at
you
through
five
interminable
acts
and
when
the
good
young
man
marries
the
good
young
woman
in
a
parlour
grossly
furnished
according
to
american
ideals
you
feel
that
both
of
them
are
well
punished
for
their
unpardonable
existence
all
real
and
delicate
romance
has
we
observe
been
wiped
out
by
the
cinematograph
illustration
the
hall
of
pearl
and
red
it
has
long
been
the
fashion
to
sneer
at
the
crystal
palace
and
indeed
the
poor
dear
has
gone
from
bad
to
worse
there
are
exhibitions
there
all
exactly
like
all
other
exhibitions
silhouettes
weary
waves
threepenny
thrills
where
you
hustle
against
strangers
and
shriek
at
the
impact
but
once
the
crystal
palace
was
otherwise
in
the
victorian
days
we
sneer
at
when
our
fathers
could
not
see
that
there
was
any
quarrel
between
knowledge
and
beauty
both
of
whom
they
loved
they
built
the
crystal
palace
as
a
temple
vowed
to
these
twin
deities
of
their
worship
think
what
the
crystal
palace
was
then
think
what
its
authors
intended
it
to
be
think
what
for
a
little
time
it
was
a
place
of
beauty
a
place
where
beauty
and
knowledge
went
hand
in
hand
it
is
quite
true
that
a
brobdingnagian
conservatory
does
not
seem
so
beautiful
to
us
as
it
did
to
the
prince
consort
and
sir
joseph
paxton
it
is
true
that
even
in
the
palmiest
days
of
the
crystal
palace
you
barked
your
shins
over
iron
girders
painted
a
light
blue
my
memory
assures
me
and
that
the
boards
of
the
flooring
were
so
far
apart
that
you
could
lose
down
the
cracks
of
them
not
only
your
weekly
sixpence
or
your
birthday
shilling
but
even
the
sudden
unexpected
cartwheel
do
they
still
call
a
crown
that
contributed
by
an
uncle
almost
more
than
human
it
is
true
that
the
gravel
of
the
paths
in
the
grounds
tired
your
feet
and
tried
your
temper
and
that
the
adventure
ended
in
a
clinging
to
bony
fingers
and
admonitions
from
nurse
not
to
drag
so
but
on
the
other
hand
think
of
the
imagination
the
feeling
for
romance
that
went
to
the
furnishing
of
the
old
crystal
palace
there
was
a
lake
in
the
grounds
of
penge
park
how
would
our
twentieth
century
deal
with
a
lake
we
need
not
pause
to
invent
an
answer
we
know
it
would
be
something
new
and
nasty
how
did
these
despised
deal
with
it
they
set
up
amid
the
rocks
and
reeds
and
trees
of
the
island
in
that
lake
images
of
the
wonders
of
a
dead
world
on
a
great
stone
crouched
a
pterodactyl
his
vast
wings
spread
for
flight
a
mammoth
sloth
embraced
a
tree
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
when
you
came
on
him
from
behind
you
in
your
six
years
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
not
real
that
he
would
not
presently
leave
the
tree
and
turn
his
attention
to
your
bloused
and
belted
self
little
boys
wore
caps
with
peaks
then
and
blouses
with
embroidered
collars
convinced
at
last
by
the
cold
feel
of
his
flank
to
your
fat
little
hand
that
he
was
but
stone
you
kept
none
the
less
a
memory
of
him
that
would
last
your
life
and
make
his
name
when
you
met
it
in
a
book
as
thrilling
as
the
name
of
a
friend
in
the
list
of
birthday
honours
there
was
an
ichthyosaurus
too
and
another
chap
whose
name
i
forget
but
he
had
a
scalloped
crest
all
down
his
back
to
the
end
of
his
tail
and
the
dinosaurus
he
had
a
round
hole
in
his
antediluvian
stomach
and
with
a
brother
his
own
turn
to
come
next
as
in
honour
bound
to
give
you
a
you
could
explore
the
roomy
interior
of
the
dinosaur
with
feelings
hardly
to
be
surpassed
by
those
of
bandits
in
a
cave
it
is
almost
impossible
to
the
dinosaurus
as
an
educational
influence
on
your
way
back
to
the
palace
itself
you
passed
water
temples
surrounded
by
pools
where
grew
afterwards
when
you
read
of
tanks
and
lotuses
and
india
you
knew
what
to
think
there
were
sphinxes
the
correct
plural
was
told
you
by
aunts
and
you
rejected
it
on
the
terrace
and
within
more
smooth
water
with
marble
at
the
edge
and
more
lilies
and
goldfish
palms
and
ferns
and
humming
pervasive
music
from
the
organ
there
were
groves
or
shrubberies
you
entered
them
with
a
fearful
joy
you
knew
that
round
the
next
corner
or
the
next
would
be
black
and
brown
and
yellow
men
savages
with
their
huts
and
their
wives
and
their
weapons
their
and
their
reed
tunics
so
near
you
that
it
was
only
a
step
across
a
little
barrier
and
you
could
pretend
that
you
also
were
a
black
a
brown
or
a
yellow
person
and
not
a
little
english
child
in
a
tunic
belt
and
peaked
cap
you
never
took
the
step
but
none
the
less
those
savages
were
your
foes
and
your
friends
and
when
you
met
them
in
your
geography
you
thrilled
to
the
encounter
further
there
were
courts
i
first
met
venus
the
armless
wonder
of
milo
and
hermes
embodied
vision
of
praxiteles
and
the
discobolus
whom
we
all
love
and
who
is
exactly
like
graham
wallas
in
youth
in
the
grecian
court
in
the
egyptian
court
there
were
pictured
pillars
and
the
very
word
egypt
is
to
me
for
their
sake
a
word
of
power
to
this
day
and
the
spanish
court
the
court
of
the
alhambra
the
lovely
mosaic
the
gold
and
the
blue
and
the
red
the
fountain
the
marble
the
strange
unnatural
beauty
of
the
horseshoe
arches
i
shall
never
see
the
alhambra
now
but
it
is
because
of
the
spanish
court
at
the
crystal
palace
that
there
will
always
be
an
empty
ache
in
my
thought
an
ache
of
the
heart
a
longing
that
is
not
all
pain
at
its
name
a
feeling
like
a
beautiful
dwarf
despair
in
that
i
never
shall
see
that
blue
and
red
and
golden
glory
and
the
mystery
of
its
strange
arches
that
open
to
the
whole
world
of
dreams
say
of
the
what
you
will
they
did
at
least
know
when
they
set
them
the
seeds
of
romance
think
of
euston
station
those
glorious
pillars
the
magnificent
dream
of
an
egyptian
building
to
loom
through
the
egyptian
darkness
of
london
fogs
and
the
architecture
of
egypt
was
too
expensive
and
euston
remains
a
magnificent
memorial
the
child
of
genius
stunted
by
finance
there
was
madame
tussaud
too
a
close
link
with
the
french
revolution
the
waxen
heads
of
kings
and
democrats
the
very
guillotine
itself
and
madame
tussaud
daughter
with
the
breathing
breast
that
seemed
alive
and
the
little
old
woman
in
the
black
bonnet
madame
herself
who
had
seen
the
rise
of
republics
and
the
deaths
of
kings
these
things
last
time
i
trod
those
halls
were
put
in
the
shade
their
place
usurped
by
vulgar
tableaux
explaining
to
the
bored
spectators
what
happens
to
a
vulgar
young
man
with
a
wife
whose
skirt
is
much
too
short
in
front
and
her
hair
very
badly
done
if
he
leaves
his
home
for
the
society
of
sirens
and
cardsharpers
the
tableaux
were
cheap
and
nasty
and
taught
one
nothing
that
one
could
not
learn
from
the
once
there
were
nightingales
that
sang
in
the
gardens
on
loampit
hill
now
it
is
all
villas
once
the
hilly
fields
were
hilly
fields
where
the
children
played
and
there
were
primroses
once
the
road
from
eltham
to
woolwich
was
a
grassy
lane
with
hedges
and
big
trees
in
the
hedges
and
wild
pinks
and
bethlehem
stars
and
ragged
robin
and
campion
now
the
trees
are
cut
down
and
there
are
no
more
flowers
it
is
asphalt
all
the
way
and
here
and
there
seats
divided
by
iron
rods
so
that
tired
tramps
should
not
sleep
on
them
and
the
green
fields
by
mottingham
where
the
kingcups
used
to
grow
and
the
willows
by
the
little
stream
they
are
eaten
up
by
yellow
caterpillars
of
streets
all
alike
all
horrible
while
in
london
old
handsome
houses
are
tenements
and
children
play
on
the
dirty
doorsteps
of
them
with
dead
mice
and
mutton
bones
for
toys
in
the
country
women
wear
men
tweed
caps
instead
of
sunbonnets
and
hinde
curlers
by
day
instead
of
curl
papers
which
if
you
were
pretty
looked
like
wreaths
of
white
roses
by
night
and
everything
is
getting
uglier
and
uglier
and
no
one
seems
to
care
and
only
the
old
people
remember
that
things
were
not
always
ugly
remember
how
different
things
were
once
illustration
a
chinese
temple
therefore
i
would
plead
with
all
those
who
have
to
do
with
children
to
resist
and
to
denounce
uglification
wherever
they
may
meet
with
it
and
to
remember
that
there
is
knowledge
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
beauty
to
show
a
child
beautiful
things
and
to
answer
as
well
all
the
questions
he
will
ask
about
them
to
charm
and
thrill
his
imagination
with
pictures
and
statues
and
models
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
to
familiarise
the
child
with
beauty
so
that
he
knows
ugliness
when
he
meets
it
and
hates
it
for
the
outrage
it
is
to
the
beauty
he
has
known
and
loved
ever
since
he
was
very
little
this
is
worth
doing
if
we
would
make
beauty
the
dear
rule
of
a
man
life
and
ugliness
the
hated
exception
we
should
make
beauty
as
familiar
to
the
child
as
the
air
he
breathes
and
if
we
associate
knowledge
with
beauty
the
child
will
love
them

life
when
the

aunt

uncle
has
given
the
bricks
when
the
flat

has
been
slipped

the
smooth
wooden
cubes

have
tumbled

on

i
am
going
to
build

the
child
or
a
tower
or
a
church
and
the
highest
hopes
inspiring
him
he
sets
out
on
the
new
adventure
but
he
does
not
build
a
palace
or
a
church
or
even
a
railway
station
what
he
builds
is
a
factory

country

the

you
see
dozens
of
along

however
strong
the
child
desire
that
what
he
shall
build
shall
be
a
palace
or
a
church
that
is
something
beautiful
and
romantic
what
he
does
build
will
always
be
the
last
thing
he
does
or
ought
to
admire
the
fault
is
in
the
materials
they
are
lacking
both
in
quality
and
quantity
no
box
of
bricks
that
can
at
present
be
bought
for
money
will
build
anything
that
can
satisfy
an
imaginative
child
an
ordinary
box
of
bricks

really
handsome
one

say
by
by
in
if
anything
admirable
is
to
be
built
from
this
amount
of
material
the
material
ought
to
be
presented
in
very
small
cubes
oblongs
and
arches
say
in
by
in
for
the
largest
bricks
and
going
down
to
by

in
given
these
proportions
a
really
pretty
though
undistinguished
building
might
result

in
the

the
smallest

the
largest

these
long
slabs
of

can
not
be
broken
and
disguised
in
such
small
buildings
as
the
only
ones
which
the
materials
are
enough
to
build

the

monotony
of

the

there
is
not
enough
variety
the
stone
bricks
it
is
true
have
broken
out
into
a
variety
of
ugly
shapes
and
a

colour
with
which
you
can
if
you
like
build
a
mansard
roof
but
a
mansard
roof
in
a
coarse
ugly
blue
tint
is
no
thing
of
beauty
besides
it
needs
a
solid
substructure
to
support
it
and
if
you
make
your
building
solid
every
brick
in
your
box
will
be
used
up
and
all
you
will
have
to
show
for
it
will
be
a
partially
built
wing
of
a
peculiarly
undesirable
villa
residence
replete
with
every
modern
inconvenience
nor
must
it
be
supposed
that
the
difficulty
can
be
met
by
adding
more
and
more
boxes
of
bricks
add
them
by
all
means
and
the
result
will
be
a
larger
and
probably
an
uglier
factory
or
a
completed
and
therefore
more
completely
hideous
villa
unless
you
are
a
millionaire
and
have
a
toy
cupboard
as
big
as
a
pantechnicon
you
will
never
have
enough
bricks
to
build
up
the
solid
masses
which
rest
the
eye
and
give
solidity
and
dignity
to
architecture
among
such
solid
masses
are
not
the
least
important
every
child
knows
that
a
really
good
flight
of
steps
will
take
half
the
bricks
in
his
box
and
leave
insufficient
material
for
the
edifice
to
which
the
steps
were
intended
to
lead
up
the
tall
broad
smooth
wall
its
quiet
surface
disturbed
only
by
one
or
two
windows
a
flight
of
steps
and
a
doorway
is
for
ever
out
of
reach
of
the
child
who
has
only
bricks
wherewith
to
build
illustration
shell
arches
the
arches
supplied
with
boxes
of
bricks
are
usually
few
and
badly
proportioned
there
is
seldom
any
provision
for
setting
them
up
in
a
colonnade
the
pillars
which
will
support
the
ends
of
two
arches
are
too
wide
for
the
arch
which
is
single
this
difficulty
is
dealt
with
in
stone
bricks
but
not
in
wooden
ones
at
any
rate
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
there
never
was
a
time
one
supposes
when
so
much
money
was
spent
on
children
and
their
toys
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
should
some
toy
maker
design
and
put
on
the
market
really
desirable
bricks
for
children
there
would
not
be
a
ready
sale
for
them
i
suggest
then
that
bricks
are
too
large
and
too
small
and
that
what
is
needed
is
much
smaller
bricks
and
much
larger
ones
the
bricks
in
the
old
chest
in
our
nursery
started
with
cubes
and
went
on
in
gradations
of
to
the
largest
brick
by
by
in
the
chest
itself
must
have
been
at
least
by
by
another
detestable
quality
in
our
modern
bricks
is
their
inexactness
a
sixteenth
or
even
a
quarter
of
an
inch
more
or
less
is
no
more
to
the
maker
of
bricks
nowadays
than
it
is
to
a
bad
dressmaker
our
bricks
were
well
and
truly
cut
they
were
of
seasoned
oak
smooth
and
pleasant
to
touch
none
of
the
edges
which
vex
the
hand
and
render
the
building
unstable
they
were
heavy
a
very
important
quality
in
bricks
they
stayed
put
i
suggest
that
such
bricks
as
these
supplemented
by
arches
of
varied
curves
but
unvarying
thicknesses
and
slabs
of
board
varying
in
breadth
but
not
in
length
would
not
be
a
toy
beyond
the
purse
of
kind
uncles
and
aunts
and
certainly
not
beyond
the
means
of
our
council
schools
the
slabs
of
boards
are
to
build
steps
with
and
to
make
roofs
with
every
child
who
has
ever
built
with
bricks
feels
the
reckless
wastefulness
of
using
for
steps
the
bricks
so
much
needed
for
walls
and
towers
and
who
has
not
experienced
the
aggravation
of
finding
when
his
tower
is
built
that
he
has
used
up
all
the
long
bricks
near
its
foundation
and
has
now
none
left
which
are
long
enough
to
lay
across
its
summit
and
form
its
roof
the
slabs
of
board
should
be
like
the
bricks
of
seasoned
oak
and
should
be
an
inch
thick
there
should
be
plenty
of
arches
so
as
to
render
possible
some
sort
of
resemblance
to
norman
and
classical
architecture
but
bricks
alone
however
beautiful
and
varied
can
not
as
building
material
have
the
value
which
material
freely
chosen
would
have
children
love
to
make
mud
pies
and
to
build
sand
castles
because
the
material
is
plastic
and
responds
with
more
or
less
of
docility
to
their
demands
upon
it
also
there
is
always
enough
of
it
which
there
never
is
of
bricks
or
for
the
matter
of
that
of
plasticine
i
can
imagine
a
splendid
happiness
for
a
child
in
a
bushel
of
plasticine
but
the
sticks
of
plasticine
are
too
small
to
be
made
into
anything
architecturally
satisfying
and
much
too
expensive
for
ordinary
children
to
have
in
any
but
such
quantities
as
encourage
niggling
you
will
notice
that
children
never
tire
of
building
sand
castles
on
the
but
they
would
soon
tire
of
building
with
a
quart
of
damp
sand
on
a
table
it
is
true
that
the
sea
washes
away
your
sand
castle
usually
before
it
is
finished
but
its
end
is
finely
catastrophic
and
full
of
damp
delightful
incident
also
the
climax
has
the
great
essential
of
drama
it
is
inevitable
how
different
the
demolition
of
the
house
by
mamma
who
wants
space
for
cutting
out
or
by
mary
who
desires
to
lay
the
table
the
most
promising
of
palaces
the
most
beautiful
of
bridges
are
at
the
urgence
of
these
needs
swept
away
and
so
never
being
able
to
finish
anything
the
builder
becomes
discouraged
perhaps
he
takes
to
the
floor
as
an
eligible
building
site
only
to
find
his
buildings
exposed
to
the
tempestuous
petticoat
of
mary
or
the
carelessly
stepping
shoes
of
mamma
the
same
thing
happens
with
a
dolls
school
or
a
dolls
or
any
game
requiring
pageantry
of
any
sort
so
that
little
girls
who
would
like
their
dolls
to
be
actors
in
some
scene
of
magnificence
find
no
safe
place
for
the
actors
save
in
their
arms
and
nurse
with
enforced
premature
maternal
fussings
the
doll
who
in
happier
circumstances
might
be
a
druid
or
a
martyr
or
francis
the
first
at
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
it
is
better
to
the
child
mind
that
the
cherished
doll
should
safely
be
baby
for
ever
than
that
it
should
be
francis
the
first
and
get
walked
on
in
any
house
where
space
makes
such
a
thing
possible
a
table
might
be
set
aside
for
children
to
be
their
very
own
a
table
on
which
neither
food
nor
millinery
should
ever
trespass
of
course
it
is
needful
that
toys
and
should
be
put
away
daily
but
it
is
not
necessary
that
they
should
all
be
put
away
those
which
are
being
used
in
some
splendid
scheme
might
surely
be
allowed
to
stay
where
they
are
so
that
it
may
be
possible
to
go
on
with
the
game
next
day
a
truce
might
be
called
of
that
ruthless
tidying
up
which
every
day
destroys
the
new
idea
and
compels
the
child
each
day
to
produce
a
new
scheme
instead
of
allowing
it
to
work
on
yesterday
and
bring
it
to
something
a
little
nearer
the
perfection
which
it
touched
when
the
child
mind
first
conceived
it
but
it
may
be
urged
children
leave
everything
and
go
off
to
something
else
of
course
they
do
but
clear
away
the
thing
and
you
will
find
when
they
come
back
from
the
butterfly
flight
after
some
other
interest
that
they
will
not
be
pleased
with
you
i
put
all
your
bricks
nicely
away
you
say
proudly
and
tommy
will
say
bother
in
his
heart
even
if
his
lips
are
sufficiently
trained
to
avoid
that
expletive
and
to
substitute
i
do
wish
you
had
i
wanted
to
finish
building
my
tower
you
see
one
thing
leads
to
another
it
is
that
children
are
any
more
than
we
are
it
is
that
they
have
not
yet
learned
to
restrain
the
thousand
curiosities
desires
and
creative
impulses
proper
to
their
age
you
of
course
if
you
desired
to
set
up
a
tableau
of
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
would
sit
down
with
a
bit
of
pencil
and
the
back
of
an
envelope
and
jot
down
all
the
properties
required
for
staging
the
scene
but
the
child
who
has
had
the
field
in
history
and
whose
imagination
has
been
stirred
by
the
name
of
it
a
thing
that
will
happen
under
the
stupidest
of
teachers
sets
up
henry
and
francis
in
paper
crowns
and
only
then
begins
to
see
that
tents
and
banners
and
cloth
of
gold
are
lacking
perhaps
he
goes
off
to
the
village
shop
to
get
flags
perhaps
to
your
handkerchief
case
for
perhaps
to
the
meadow
beyond
the
orchard
to
gather
buttercups
while
on
any
of
these
quests
some
supremely
important
event
may
strike
across
his
plans
and
overshadow
them
a
new
kitten
a
gift
from
the
gardener
of
plants
for
his
little
garden
or
the
fact
that
some
one
is
going
fishing
then
francis
and
henry
are
forgotten
the
buttercups
left
dying
on
the
doorstep
and
the
crammed
into
the
pockets
among
string
stamps
acid
drops
and
pieces
of
the
watch
he
took
to
pieces
last
holidays
and
never
put
together
again
and
he
will
follow
the
new
trail
but
he
will
come
back
to
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
and
if
you
have
tidied
up
the
kings
and
put
their
crowns
in
the
wastepaper
basket
the
child
will
be
disappointed
and
worried
his
imagination
checked
and
his
scheme
baffled
illustration
handkerchief
tents
his
annexation
of
your
handkerchiefs
will
not
occur
if
you
have
accustomed
him
to
come
to
you
or
to
his
nurse
for
the
means
to
his
small
ends
but
if
there
is
no
one
to
whom
he
can
apply
for
help
you
will
find
that
he
will
not
stick
at
the
sacred
threshold
of
your
handkerchief
case
the
tents
of
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
will
be
far
more
important
to
him
than
the
inviolability
of
that
scented
unless
of
course
you
happen
to
have
explained
to
him
exactly
how
much
you
dislike
that
your
handkerchiefs
should
keep
the
sort
of
company
they
meet
with
in
his
pockets
then
if
he
loves
you
and
has
found
you
reasonable
he
will
refrain
while
wondering
at
your
prejudices
but
he
will
or
ought
to
find
some
other
material
for
tents
letter
paper
perhaps
letter
paper
makes
quite
good
tents
though
not
nearly
so
good
of
course
as
handkerchiefs
folded
diagonally
supported
by
a
central
pole
say
a
penholder
and
fastened
down
at
the
corners
with
pins
or
rose
thorns
you
can
explain
to
him
that
hurt
handkerchiefs
but
you
will
not
punish
him
if
this
has
not
occurred
to
him
and
this
brings
one
to
the
question
of
crime
and
punishment
of
which
perhaps
i
had
better
say
what
i
have
to
say
before
i
go
on
talking
about
bricks
and
how
to
supplement
them
as
i
was
saying
one
thing
leads
to
another
chapter
viii
the
moral
code
in
attempting
to
explain
and
enforce
a
moral
code
the
first
and
most
essential
need
is
to
formulate
definitely
to
oneself
the
code
which
one
proposes
to
enforce
and
to
explain
there
is
nothing
from
which
children
and
subject
human
beings
generally
suffer
so
much
as
the
incoherence
of
the
thought
of
those
in
authority
over
them
before
you
can
begin
to
lay
down
the
law
you
must
know
what
that
law
is
and
your
heart
soul
and
spirit
must
not
only
know
it
but
approve
it
before
you
can
gain
a
willing
obedience
to
it
from
those
on
whom
you
wish
to
impose
it
by
this
i
do
not
mean
only
that
we
ought
to
make
up
our
minds
whether
this
that
or
the
other
isolated
act
is
right
or
wrong
as
it
occurs
but
that
we
ought
to
have
a
clear
perception
and
knowledge
of
the
things
that
are
right
and
the
things
that
are
wrong
and
have
a
standard
which
we
can
apply
to
any
new
action
brought
under
our
notice
so
that
measuring
the
new
act
by
our
old
standard
we
shall
be
able
to
say
with
some
sort
of
rough
accuracy
this
is
wrong
or
this
is
right
and
the
standard
of
expediency
is
not
a
good
one
for
this
purpose
nor
is
the
standard
of
custom
nor
yet
the
standard
of
gentility
or
the
standard
of
success
in
life
children
are
not
good
judges
of
expediency
the
law
of
mere
custom
will
not
be
strong
enough
to
bind
them
when
desire
calls
with
enchanting
voice
to
forbidden
things
gentility
and
the
gospel
of
getting
on
will
leave
them
cold
you
may
at
first
deal
merely
with
a
succession
of
unrelated
particulars
saying
this
is
right
this
is
wrong
beating
down
the
children
questionings
by
your
mere
but
a
time
will
come
when
it
will
not
be
enough
in
answer
to
their
why
is
it
wrong
why
is
it
right
to
answer
because
i
say
so
the
child
will
want
some
other
standard
which
he
himself
can
apply
the
standard
of
what
you
say
may
be
a
shifting
one
and
anyhow
he
can
not
be
at
all
sure
what
you
will
say
unless
he
knows
what
is
your
standard
the
standard
by
which
you
will
decide
whether
to
say
in
any
given
case
that
a
thing
is
wrong
or
right
and
in
order
that
you
may
clearly
set
before
the
child
your
own
moral
standard
you
must
first
have
set
it
very
clearly
before
yourself
it
is
not
enough
to
say
stealing
is
wrong
lying
is
wrong
greediness
is
wrong
if
you
feel
that
these
things
are
wrong
because
they
are
contrary
to
the
will
of
god
you
will
not
find
that
that
explanation
is
sufficient
for
a
child
unless
he
knows
very
much
more
about
god
than
his
name
and
certain
miraculous
and
incomprehensible
attributes
of
his
he
will
want
to
know
what
is
the
will
of
god
to
which
these
wrong
things
are
contrary
and
he
will
want
very
much
to
know
the
definite
right
as
well
as
the
definite
wrong
you
will
have
to
give
the
child
a
standard
that
can
be
applied
to
positives
as
well
as
negatives
there
is
a
very
simple
standard
by
which
to
measure
the
actions
of
children
and
much
more
severely
our
own
actions
it
is
set
up
in
the
words
of
christ
do
unto
others
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
a
standard
so
simple
that
quite
little
children
can
understand
and
apply
it
a
standard
so
severe
that
were
it
understood
and
applied
by
us
who
are
no
longer
children
the
warped
tangled
rotten
web
we
call
civilisation
could
not
endure
for
a
day
there
is
no
other
standard
by
which
a
child
can
judge
its
own
actions
and
yours
and
judge
them
justly
having
fixed
your
standard
it
will
be
necessary
to
try
your
own
actions
by
it
as
well
as
the
child
and
this
standard
will
give
you
the
only
vital
code
of
morality
because
it
compels
the
continual
exercise
of
imagination
the
continual
preening
and
flight
of
the
wings
of
the
soul
you
can
not
order
your
life
by
that
divine
precept
without
a
hundred
times
a
day
asking
yourself
how
should
like
that
if
i
were
not
myself
without
continually
putting
yourself
imaginatively
in
some
one
else
place
and
when
the
child
asks
why
is
it
wrong
to
steal
you
can
lead
him
to
see
how
little
he
would
like
to
have
his
own
possessions
stolen
when
he
asks
why
is
it
wrong
to
lie
you
may
teach
him
to
imagine
his
own
bitterness
if
others
should
deceive
him
it
is
of
course
much
easier
to
say
it
is
wrong
because
i
say
so
or
even
because
god
says
so
but
if
you
want
to
mark
it
right
or
wrong
to
grave
it
deeply
and
ineffaceably
on
the
tables
of
the
heart
and
the
soul
teach
the
child
to
see
for
himself
things
are
right
and
wrong
and
to
judge
of
them
by
that
one
divine
and
unfailing
rule
of
course
even
when
the
child
knows
what
is
right
he
will
not
always
do
it
any
more
than
you
do
and
one
of
the
questions
to
be
considered
is
how
you
shall
deal
with
those
lapses
from
moral
rectitude
of
which
he
no
less
than
you
will
often
be
guilty
punishments
the
old
savage
punishments
were
revenge
and
nothing
but
revenge
a
desire
to
pay
out
the
offender
to
take
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
more
humane
and
reasonable
legislators
have
sought
to
prove
that
punishment
is
curative
that
the
fear
of
punishment
will
deter
people
from
doing
wrong
a
distinguished
official
of
the
home
office
gave
it
as
his
opinion
only
the
other
day
that
punishment
no
matter
how
severe
will
not
act
as
a
deterrent
if
there
is
ever
so
slight
a
chance
of
the
criminal
escaping
it
what
would
deter
would
be
the
of
punishment
however
slight
now
since
you
are
not
omniscient
you
can
not
pretend
to
your
child
that
if
he
does
wrong
you
are
certain
to
know
and
to
punish
him
if
you
are
silly
enough
to
pretend
it
he
will
find
you
out
immediately
and
estimate
your
lie
at
its
true
blackness
you
can
however
without
any
pretence
assure
him
that
if
he
does
wrong
he
himself
will
know
it
that
it
will
make
him
feel
unclean
and
nasty
and
miserable
till
he
is
able
to
wash
himself
in
the
waters
of
repentance
and
forgiveness
that
if
he
acts
meanly
and
dirtily
he
will
feel
dirty
and
mean
and
if
he
acts
bravely
and
cleanly
he
will
feel
clean
and
brave
and
he
will
find
that
what
you
say
is
true
but
not
unless
you
shall
have
succeeded
in
convincing
him
that
your
standard
is
a
true
standard
and
that
the
things
which
that
standard
shows
to
be
wrong
are
wrong
indeed
here
is
the
highest
work
of
the
imagination
to
teach
the
child
so
to
put
himself
in
the
place
of
the
one
he
has
wronged
that
the
knowledge
of
that
wrong
shall
be
its
own
punishment
no
one
desires
of
course
that
a
child
should
be
always
feeling
his
own
moral
pulse
if
he
has
learned
that
there
is
a
right
and
a
wrong
way
he
will
not
be
always
bothering
about
which
way
he
may
be
living
it
will
be
only
when
something
goes
amiss
that
he
will
stop
and
consider
just
as
one
does
not
stop
to
think
whether
one
is
breathing
properly
only
when
one
chokes
one
knows
that
one
is
illustration
one
half
of
the
city
punishment
however
should
not
be
confused
with
the
consequences
of
action
and
while
children
are
yet
too
small
to
understand
all
that
god
may
be
to
them
it
is
possible
to
show
them
the
of
their
misdeeds
magnifying
these
beyond
the
consequences
of
the
act
to
be
reprobated
and
thus
pointing
the
general
moral
i
mean
that
one
may
honourably
apply
to
the
small
of
childhood
the
of
consequences
proportioned
of
course
to
the
which
would
result
from
such
on
a
larger
scale
by
a
person
it
will
be
exceedingly
troublesome
and
painful
for
you
but
perhaps
its
painfulness
to
you
may
be
the
measure
of
its
value
to
the
child
for
instance
tommy
steals
a
penny
knowing
that
to
steal
pennies
is
wrong
he
is
very
little
and
a
penny
is
very
little
and
your
impulse
if
not
to
slap
him
might
be
to
tell
him
that
he
is
a
very
naughty
boy
and
have
done
with
it
it
will
go
to
your
heart
to
bring
home
to
him
the
consequences
of
theft
especially
as
you
can
not
do
it
at
once
but
if
next
time
you
are
about
to
send
him
to
the
shop
for
something
you
say
no
i
ca
send
you
because
you
might
steal
my
pennies
as
you
did
the
other
day
this
will
be
hateful
for
you
to
do
but
it
will
show
him
more
plainly
than
anything
else
what
happens
to
people
who
steal
they
are
not
trusted
and
the
same
with
lies
show
him
that
those
who
tell
lies
are
not
believed
but
remembering
how
it
felt
to
be
a
child
have
pity
and
do
not
teach
him
these
lessons
when
any
one
else
is
there
let
the
humiliation
of
them
be
a
secret
between
you
two
alone
only
when
a
wrong
has
been
done
which
demands
a
restitution
or
an
amend
should
the
soul
of
the
child
shamed
with
be
exposed
to
alien
eyes
when
we
sit
in
judgment
on
the
aggressions
and
on
the
shortcomings
of
others
the
first
need
is
neither
justice
nor
mercy
but
imagination
with
the
judge
should
be
able
to
put
himself
in
the
place
of
the
accused
to
perceive
by
sympathetic
vision
the
point
of
view
of
the
one
who
stands
before
the
the
judge
is
an
adult
human
being
and
therefore
has
some
knowledge
of
the
mental
and
moral
processes
of
human
beings
he
should
use
this
knowledge
and
when
it
comes
to
a
judging
a
child
it
is
no
less
necessary
for
the
judge
to
place
himself
imaginatively
in
the
place
of
the
small
offender
and
this
can
not
be
done
by
imagination
and
alone
memory
is
needed
let
me
say
it
again
there
is
only
one
way
of
understanding
children
they
can
not
be
understood
by
imagination
by
observation
nor
even
by
love
they
can
only
be
understood
by
memory
only
by
remembering
how
you
felt
and
thought
when
you
yourself
were
a
child
can
you
arrive
at
any
understanding
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
children
when
you
were
a
child
you
suffered
intensely
from
injustice
from
want
of
understanding
in
your
censors
you
were
punished
when
you
had
not
meant
to
do
wrong
you
escaped
punishment
when
you
had
not
meant
to
do
right
the
whole
scheme
of
law
seemed
to
you
and
very
likely
was
arbitrary
and
incomprehensible
and
you
suffered
from
it
desperately
so
much
that
even
if
you
have
now
forgotten
all
that
you
suffered
the
mark
of
that
suffering
none
the
less
remains
on
your
soul
to
this
day
it
would
seem
that
the
humiliations
the
mortifications
endured
in
childhood
leave
an
ineffaceable
brand
on
the
spirit
how
then
can
we
not
remember
and
remembering
refrain
from
hurting
other
children
as
we
were
hurt
the
spirit
of
the
child
is
sensitive
to
the
slightest
change
in
the
atmosphere
about
him
you
can
convey
disapproval
quite
easily
and
approval
also
but
while
most
parents
and
guardians
are
constantly
alive
to
the
necessity
for
expressing
disapproval
and
inflicting
punishment
the
other
side
of
the
medal
seems
to
be
hidden
from
them
the
most
prevalent
idea
of
training
children
is
the
idea
of
prohibition
and
punishment
you
are
not
to
do
it
you
will
then
take
that
the
blow
or
punishment
following
expresses
simply
and
exactly
the
whole
theory
of
moral
education
held
by
the
mass
of
modern
mothers
the
vast
mistake
both
in
the
education
of
children
and
government
of
nations
is
the
heavy
stress
laid
on
the
negative
virtues
also
the
fact
that
punishment
follows
on
the
failure
to
do
certain
things
whereas
no
commensurate
reward
is
offered
even
for
success
in
doing
let
alone
for
success
in
active
and
honourable
the
reward
of
negative
virtue
is
negative
also
and
consists
simply
in
the
rewards
of
active
virtue
are
in
the
world
of
men
money
and
praise
but
there
are
deeds
for
which
money
can
not
pay
and
sometimes
these
are
rewarded
by
medals
and
paragraphs
in
the
newspapers
not
at
all
the
same
thing
as
being
rewarded
by
the
praise
of
your
now
children
like
all
sane
human
beings
love
praise
they
love
it
more
keenly
perhaps
than
other
human
beings
because
their
natural
craving
for
it
has
not
been
overlaid
with
false
modesties
and
shames
they
have
not
learned
that
praise
to
the
face
is
open
disgrace
on
the
contrary
praise
to
the
face
seems
to
them
natural
right
and
altogether
desirable
see
that
they
get
it
do
you
remember
when
you
were
little
how
you
struggled
to
exercise
some
tiresome
negative
virtue
such
as
not
biting
your
nails
not
teasing
the
cat
not
executing
with
your
that
heavy
shuffling
movement
so
simply
relieving
to
you
so
mysteriously
annoying
to
the
can
you
have
forgotten
how
for
ages
and
ages
three
or
four
days
even
you
refrained
from
drinking
water
with
your
mouth
full
of
food
from
leaving
your
handkerchief
about
in
obvious
spots
natural
and
convenient
how
you
sternly
denied
yourself
the
pleasure
of
drawing
your
hoop
stick
along
the
front
railings
because
though
you
enjoyed
this
musical
exercise
others
did
not
and
how
all
through
the
interminable
period
of
you
heartened
yourself
to
these
dismal
refrainings
by
the
warm
comfortable
thought
they
be
pleased
and
how
they
never
were
they
took
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
to
them
because
they
had
forgotten
how
it
felt
to
be
a
child
all
your
heroic
sacrifices
and
renunciations
counted
as
nothing
to
them
it
was
natural
that
a
child
should
keep
his
fingers
out
of
his
mouth
and
off
the
tail
of
puss
should
keep
his
feet
still
and
his
handkerchief
in
his
pocket
should
do
the
suitable
things
with
meat
drink
and
they
never
noticed
and
so
they
never
praised
but
when
worn
out
by
long
abstinence
from
natural
joys
natural
relaxations
you
broke
one
of
those
rules
which
seemed
to
you
so
useless
and
so
arbitrary
then
they
noticed
fast
enough
illustration
the
tail
of
puss
can
you
remember
they
said
just
a
simple
thing
like
not
biting
your
nails
bitter
aloes
following
no
doubt
or
i
really
should
have
thought
they
would
say
that
considering
the
number
of
times
i
spoken
about
it
you
would
remember
not
to
make
that
frightful
noise
with
boots
or
hoop
sticks
or
a
blade
of
wet
grass
or
what
not
they
did
not
pause
to
think
in
their
earnest
business
of
bringing
the
boy
up
how
many
how
very
many
and
how
seemingly
silly
were
the
which
you
had
to
remember
but
you
will
not
be
like
that
you
will
notice
and
approve
and
most
needful
of
all
reward
with
praise
the
earnest
difficult
refrainings
of
the
child
who
is
trying
to
please
you
who
is
trying
to
learn
the
long
table
of
your
commandments
all
beginning
with
thou
shalt
not
and
to
practise
them
not
because
these
commandments
appeal
to
him
as
reasonable
or
just
or
useful
but
just
because
he
loves
you
wants
to
please
you
and
deepest
need
of
love
wants
you
to
be
pleased
with
him
a
hasty
yet
determined
effort
at
putting
yourself
in
his
place
is
the
thing
needed
every
time
you
have
to
sit
in
judgment
on
the
actions
of
another
human
being
most
of
all
when
that
human
being
is
a
little
child
if
we
cultivated
this
habit
we
should
not
hurt
other
people
as
we
do
i
have
seen
cruel
things
a
little
girl
suffering
from
a
slight
affection
of
the
eye
was
given
by
a
sympathetic
aunt
the
run
of
a
box
of
that
aunt
old
she
spent
a
whole
hour
in
arranging
a
costume
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
of
royal
beauty
a
crushed
pink
tulle
dress
a
striped
roman
sash
white
satin
slippers
put
on
over
the

strapped

and

said
the
child
and
the
housemaid
responded
heartily
that
you
are
ducky
and
no
mistake
go
and
show
mother
but
mother
when
she
was
told
that
this
stumbling
bundle
of
crushed
finery
was
a
beautiful
princess
laughed
and
said
princess
i
should
say
it
only
pretending
you
know
the
child
explained
wondering
why
explanations
should
be
needed
by
mother
and
not
by
eliza
the
mother
laughed
again
i
should
pretend
to
be
a
princess
with
that
great
stye
in
my
eye
she
said
and
thought
no
more
about
it
but
the
child
remembers
to
this
day
how
she
slunk
away
and
tore
off
the
beautiful
and
cried
and
cried
and
cried
and
wished
that
she
was
dead
children
really
do
wish
that
sometimes
another
form
of
cruelty
is
mere
carelessness
a
child
spends
hours
in
preparing
some
surprise
for
you
decorates
your
room
with
flowers
not
in
the
best
taste
perhaps
and
fading

before
your
impatiently
awaited
arrival
or
ties
scarves
and
handkerchiefs
to
the
banisters
to
represent
flags
at
your
very
pretty
dear
you
say
carelessly
hardly
looking
and
the
child
sees
that
you
hardly
look
and
now
clear
it
all
away
there
a
dear
the
child
clears
it
all
away
and
with
the
dying
flowers
something
else
is
cleared
away
something
that
will
no
more
live
again
than
will
the
faded
flowers
be
generous
of
praise
it
is
the
dew
that
waters
the
budding
flowers
of
kindness
and
love
and
unselfishness

all

the

while
admitting
that
no
pains
can
be
too
great
no
labours
too
arduous

passionately
desiring

may
incidentally
and
quite
without

something
very
vital
in

enforced
by
violence
was
the

never

some
danger
that
the
pendulum
may
swing
too
far
and
that
the
aim

may
come
to

only
the
ensuring
of
a
happy
childhood
without
arming
the
child
for
the
battle
of
life
it
is
right
that
to
the
educator
the
child
should
be
the
prime
object
the
centre
of
the
universe
the
prime
consideration
to
which
every
other
consideration
must
give
way
but
there
is
the
danger
that
the
child
may
become
his
own
prime
object
not
only
the
centre
of
his
own
universe

its
circumference
and
cherish
deeply
rooted
in
his
inmost
soul
the
conviction
that
all
other
considerations
should

to
his

him

rough

school
that
he
is
only
the
centre

his

that
sense
in
which
the

is
true
of
us
all
that
far
from
being
the
prime
object
of
the
world
which
surrounds
him
he
himself
counts
for
little
or
nothing
except
to
those
who
love
him

the
consideration
he
receives
will
not
be
as
was
the
consideration
lavished
on
him
in
his
childhood

ungrudging

invariable
but
will
be
conditioned

the
services
he
renders
to
others
and
the
extent
to
which
he
can
be
to
them
pleasant

will
teach
him
all
this

if

a
course
of
lessons
in
a
wholly
new
subject
they
will
be
very
difficult
to
learn
and
the
learning
will
hurt
whereas
if
from
the
very
beginning
the
child
is
taught
to
understand
the
interdependence
of
human
beings
the
fact
that
rights
involve
duties
and
that
duties
confer
rights
he
will
be
able
to
apply
and
to
use
for
his
own
help
the
lessons
which
later
life
will
teach
him
more
he
will
have
at
the
outset
of
life
the
advantage
which
one
with
a
clear
conception
of
rights
and
duties
has
over
one
who
only
sees
life
as
a
muddle
and
maze
of
things
that
are
jolly
hard
lines
they
suffer
as
without
hope
who
see
that
the
world
needs
mending
and
have
never
made
up
their
minds
what
sort
of
world
they
would
like
whereas
the
child
to
whom
quite
early
the
lesson
of
human
solidarity
has
been
taught
will
when
he
shall
be
a
man
know
very
well
what
he
wants
and
will
be
able
however
humbly
to
help
in
his
day
and
generation
to
the
world
to
the
fashion
of
his
desire
it
is
not
difficult
to
teach
children
the
duties
of
kindness
and
helpfulness
to
others
and
the
duty
of
public
spirit
and
loyalty
to
their
a
healthy
child
is
active
energetic
and
deeply
desirous
of
using
his
senses
and
his
faculties
it
is
possible
to
assign
to
quite
a
small
child
certain
duties
but
the
wise
educator
will
manage
to
make
such
duties
privileges
and
not
tasks
the
system
of
sentencing
children
to
the
performance
of
useful
offices
by
way
of
punishment
is
abominable
it
gives
them
for
ever
a
distaste
for
that
particular
form
of
social
service
if
we
must
punish
let
us
not
permit
the
punishments
to
trench
on
the
province
of
useful
and
in
good
conditions
pleasant
tasks
give
the
boy
an
imposition
rather
than
an
order
to
weed
the
shrubbery
walk
set
the
girl
to
learn
a
french
verb
rather
than
to
hem
dusters
the
consciousness
of
being
useful
is
very
dear
to
children
it
is
worth
while
to
feel
and
to
show
gratitude
to
them
for
all
services
rendered
and
though
it
may
be
as
they
say
more
trouble
than
it
is
worth
to
teach
the
children
to
help
effectually
that
only
means
that
it
is
more
trouble
than
the
help
they
give
is
worth
what
is
really
valuable
is
the
cultivation
of
the
sense
that
it
is
a
good
and
pleasant
thing
to
help
mother
to
wash
up
to
help
father
to
water
the
geraniums
and
further
a
thing
which
will
make
father
and
mother
pleased
and
grateful
children
like
the
rest
of
us
love
to
feel
themselves
important
is
it
not
well
that
they
should
feel
themselves
important
as
givers
and
not
as
claimants
only
the
tale
of
their
public
obligations
may
well
begin
with
the
lesson
that
it
is
part
of
the
duty
of
a
citizen
to
help
to
keep
his
city
his
country
clean
and
beautiful
therefore
we
must
not
leave
nasty
traces
of
our
presence
in
street
or
meadow
such
traces
as
and
the
greasy
bag
that
once
held
the
bun
or
the
and
it
is
quite
as
important
to
learn
what
we
should
as
what
we
should
not
do
the
idea
and
organisation
of
the
boy
scouts
is
a
fine
in
the
way
of
training
children
to
be
good
citizens
the
duties
of
a
citizen
should
be
taught
in
all
schools
they
are
more
important
than
the
latitude
of
cathay
and
the
industries
of
kamskatka
even
the
smallest
children
could
learn
something
of
this
branch
of
education
i
should
like
to
write
a
little
book
of
moral
songs
for
young
citizens
only
i
would
call
it
that
the
songs
in
it
might
take
the
place
of
mary
had
a
little
lamb
or
whatever
it
is
that
they
make
the
infants
learn
by
heart
one
of
them
might
go
something
like
this
i
must
not
steal
and
i
must
learn
nothing
is
mine
that
i
do
not
earn
i
must
try
in
work
and
play
to
make
things
beautiful
every
day
i
must
be
kind
to
every
one
and
never
let
cruel
things
be
done
i
must
be
brave
and
i
must
try
when
i
am
hurt
never
to
cry
and
always
laugh
as
much
as
i
can
and
be
glad
that
i
going
to
be
a
man
to
work
for
my
living
and
help
the
rest
and
never
do
less
than
my
very
best
another
might
begin
i
must
not
litter
the
park
or
the
street
with
bits
of
paper
or
things
to
eat
i
must
not
pick
the
public
flowers
they
are
not
but
they
are
and
so
on
simple
rhymes
learned
when
you
are
very
young
stay
with
you
all
your
life
the
duties
and
refrainings
just
touched
on
here
might
be
elaborated
in
different
poems
there
might
be
one
on
being
brave
and
another
on
prompt
obedience
to
the
word
of
command
there
is
no
position
in
life
where
the
habit
of
obedience
to
your
superior
officer
is
not
of
value
to
teach
obedience
without
bullying
would
be
quite
easy
with
very
little
children
it
could
take
the
form
of
a
game
in
which
a
series
of
orders
were
given
for
the
performance
of
such
actions
as
occur
in
the
mulberry
bush
and
the
competition
among
the
children
to
be
the
first
to
obey
the
new
order
would
quicken
the
child
mind
and
body
while
the
habit
of
obedience
to
the
word
of
command
would
be
firmly
planted
so
that
it
would
grow
with
the
child
growth
and
adapt
itself
to
the
needs
of
life
i
would
write
more
than
one
poem
i
think
about
the
green
country
and
the
shame
it
is
that
those
who
should
love
and
protect
it
desecrate
it
as
they
do
let
it
be
the
pride
of
the
child
that
he
is
not
of
the
sort
of
people
who
leave
greasy
papers
lying
about
in
woods
broken
bottles
in
meadows
and
old
sardine
tins
among
the
rushes
at
the
margin
of
cool
streams
such
people
touch
no
foot
of
land
that
they
do
not
desecrate
and
defile
wherever
they
are
suffered
to
be
there
they
leave
behind
them
the
vilest
leavings
filthy
papers
the
rinds
and
skins
of
fruit
crusts
and
parings
jagged
tins
smashed
bottles
straw
and
shavings
and
empty
stained
cardboard
boxes
they
leave
it
all
openly
and
shamelessly
making
the
magic
meadows
sordid
as
a
suburb
and
carrying
into
the
very
heart
of
the
country
the
vulgarities
of
the
street
corner
it
is
time
indeed
that
certain
of
the
finer
duties
of
citizenship
were
taught
in
all
schools
harrow
as
well
as
houndsditch
eton
as
well
as
borstal
and
one
of
the
first
of
these
is
the
keeping
of
the
beauty
of
beautiful
places
unsmirched
the
duty
of
preserving
for
others
the
beauty
which
we
ourselves
admire
the
duty
of
burning
bits
of
paper
and
burying
pieces
of
if
there
is
not
time
to
teach
geography
as
well
as
the
duties
and
decencies
of
a
citizen
the
geography
should
go
and
the
duties
and
decencies
be
taught
for
what
is
the
use
of
knowing
the
names
of
places
if
you
do
not
know
that
places
should
be
beautiful
and
what
is
the
use
of
knowing
how
many
counties
there
are
in
england
unless
you
know
also
that
every
field
and
every
tree
and
every
stream
in
every
one
of
those
counties
is
a
precious
gift
of
god
not
to
be
desecrated
by
shameless
refuse
and
garbage
but
to
be
cared
for
as
one
cares
for
one
garden
and
loved
as
one
should
love
every
inch
of
our
england
this
more
beautiful
than
any
garden
in
the
world
a
child
should
be
taught
to
read
almost
as
soon
as
it
has
learned
to
speak
i
can
remember
my
fourth
birthday
but
i
can
not
remember
a
time
when
i
could
not
read
without
going
into
details
as
to
the
merits
of
different
methods
of
teaching
i
may
say
that
a
good
many
words
may
be
taught
before
it
is
necessary
to
teach
the
letters
that
reading
should
precede
spelling
that
cat
should
be
presented
whole
as
the
symbol
of
cat
and
that
the
dissection
of
it
into
should
come
later
i
believe
that
children
taught
in
this
way
and
taught
young
will
not
in
after
life
be
tortured
by
the
difficulties
of
spelling
they
will
spell
naturally
as
they
speak
or
walk
of
the
value
of
the
accomplishment
of
reading
as
a
to
parents
and
guardians
it
would
be
impossible
to
speak
too
highly
it
keeps
the
child
busy
amused
still
and
quiet
the
value
to
the
child
himself
is
not
less
nor
is
it
only
that
the
matter
of
his
reading
stores
his
mind
with
new
material
to
him
also
it
is
a
good
thing
that
he
should
sometimes
be
still
and
quiet
and
at
the
same
time
interested
and
occupied
of
books
for
little
children
there
are
plenty
not
fine
literature
it
is
true
but
harmless
as
the
child
grows
older
he
will
want
more
books
and
different
books
and
if
you
insist
on
personally
conducting
him
on
his
grand
tour
through
literature
he
will
probably
miss
a
good
many
places
that
he
would
like
to
go
to
for
a
child
from
ten
onwards
it
is
no
bad
thing
to
give
the
run
of
a
good
general
library
when
he
has
exhausted
the
story
books
he
will
read
the
ballads
the
histories
and
the
travels
and
may
even
nibble
at
science
poetry
or
philosophy
i
myself
at
the
age
of
thirteen
browsed
contentedly
in
such
a
library
where
percy
anecdotes
in
volumes
or
so
divided
my
attention
with
hume
locke
and
berkeley
i
even
read
burton
of
and
was
none
the
worse
for
it
it
is
astonishing
how
little
harm
comes
to
children
through
books
unless
they
have
been
taught
by
servants
chatter
how
to
look
for
the
harm
they
do
not
find
it
i
do
not
mean
that
absolutely
every
book
is
fit
for
a
child
reading
but
if
you
allow
the
reading
of
the
old
testament
it
is
mere
imbecility
to
insist
that
all
the
rest
of
your
child
reading
shall
ignore
the
facts
of
life
you
can
always
have
a
locked
if
you
choose
only
see
to
it
that
the
doors
are
not
of
glass
for
the
forbidden
is
always
the
desired
as
regards
the
facts
of
life
by
which
i
mean
the
physiological
facts
about
which
there
is
so
much
needless
and
vain
concealment
there
is
it
seems
to
me
only
one
rule
if
your
child
has
learned
to
love
and
trust
you
it
will
come
to
you
with
its
questions
instead
of
going
to
the
housemaid
or
the
groom
answer
all
its
questions
truthfully
even
at
the
cost
of
a
little
trouble
in
formulating
your
answers
do
not
leave
the
child
to
learn
the
truth
about
its
body
and
its
birth
from
vulgar
and
tainted
sources
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
you
can
not
decently
tell
a
child
when
it
has
reached
the
age
when
it
understands
that
certain
things
are
not
fit
subjects
for
public
conversation
and
until
it
has
reached
that
age
it
will
not
ask
that
sort
of
questions
there
is
no
difficulty
in
making
children
understand
that
their
digestive
processes
are
not
to
be
discussed
in
general
society
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
explain
to
them
that
other
physiological
processes
are
also
to
be
avoided
as
subjects
for
general
conversation
the
cat
and
her
family
will
help
you
to
explain
all
that
the
child
wants
to
know
the
child
should
be
taught
that
its
body
is
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
and
that
it
is
our
duty
to
keep
our
bodies
healthy
clean
and
just
as
we
should
try
to
keep
our
minds
strong
and
active
and
our
hearts
tender
and
pure
and
one
need
not
always
talk
down
to
children
they
understand
far
better
than
you
think
they
are
always
flattered
by
talk
that
rises
now
and
then
above
the
level
of
their
understanding
and
if
they
do
not
understand
they
will
tell
you
so
and
you
can
simplify
in
talking
of
the
subjects
which
interest
them
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
too
clever
for
even
if
they
do
not
ask
your
instinct
and
the
child
eyes
will
if
there
be
love
and
trust
between
you
tell
you
when
you
are
getting
out
of
its
depth
but
there
must
be
love
and
trust
without
that
all
education
outside
is
for
ever
impossible
chapter
x
the
one
thing
needful
the
most
ardent
advocate
of
our
present
civilisation
the
blindest
worshipper
of
what
we
call
progress
can
hardly
fail
to
be
aware
of
the
steadily
increasing
and
brutal
ugliness
of
life
civilisation
whatever
else
it
is
is
a
state
in
which
a
few
people
have
the
chance
of
living
beautifully
those
who
take
that
chance
are
fewer
still
and
the
enormous
majority
live
by
no
choice
or
will
of
their
own
lives
which
at
the
best
are
uncomfortable
anxious
and
lacking
in
beauty
and
at
the
worst
are
so
ugly
diseased
desperate
and
wretched
that
those
who
feel
their
condition
most
can
hardly
bear
to
think
of
them
and
those
who
have
not
imagination
enough
to
feel
it
fully
yet
can
not
bear
it
unless
they
succeed
in
persuading
themselves
that
the
poor
of
this
world
are
the
heirs
of
the
next
while
hoping
at
the
same
time
that
a
portion
of
lazarus
heavenly
legacy
may
after
all
be
reserved
for
dives
the
hideous
disfigurement
of
lovely
hills
and
dales
with
factories
and
mines
and
pot
banks
coal
cinder
and
slag
the
defilement
of
bright
rivers
with
the
refuse
of
oil
and
dye
works
the
eating
up
of
the
green
country
by
greedy
long
creeping
yellow
caterpillars
of
streets
the
smoke
and
fog
that
veil
the
sun
in

the
sordid
enamelled
iron
advertisements
that
scar
the
fields
of
earth
all
the
torn
paper
and
straw
and
dirt
and
disorder
spring
from
one
root
and
from
the

root
spring
pride
anger
cruelty
and
sycophancy
the
mean
subservience
of
the
poor
and
the
mean
arrogance
of
the
rich
as
the
fair
face
of
the
green
country
is
disfigured
by
all
this
machinery
which
ministers
to
the
hope
of
getting
rich
so
is

marred
by
the
fear
of
getting
poor
look
at
the
faces
you
see
in
the
street
old
and
young
gay
and
sad
on
all
there
is
the
brand
of
anxiety
a
terrible
anxiety
that
never
rests
a
fear
that
never
sleeps
the
anxiety
for
the
future
the
fear
of
poverty
for
the
rich
the
fear
of
starvation
for
the
poor
think
of
the
miles
and
miles
of
sordid
squalor
and
suffering
in
the
east
of
london
not
in
comfortable
whitechapel
but
out
canning
town
way
think
of
barking
and
plaistow
and
plashet
and
bow
then
think
of
park
lane
and
bond
street
and
if
your
eyes
are
not
blinded
the
west
is
no
less
terrible
than
the
east
if
you
want
to
be
sure
of
this
bring
a
hungry
ragged
child
from
that
eastern
land
and
set
it
outside
a
west
end
restaurant
let
it
press
its
dirty
little
face
against
the
plate
glass
and
gaze
at
the
people
gorging
and
guzzling
round
the
bright
tables
inside
the
diners
may
be
smart
the
ragged
child
may
be
picturesque
but
bring
the
two
together
and
consider
the
conjunction
illustration
the
hideous
disfigurement
and
all
this
ugliness
springs
from
the
same
cause
as
ruskin
says
we
have
forgotten
god
we
have
therefore
forgotten
his
attributes
mercy
justice
truth
and
beauty
their
names
are
still
on
our
lips
but
the
great
stupid
crashing
blundering
machine
which
we
call
civilisation
knows
them
not
the
devil
gospel
of
still
inspires
the
calloused
heart
of
man
each
for
himself
and
mammon
for
the
foremost
we
no
longer
care
that
life
should
be
beautiful
for
all
god
children
we
wish
it
to
be
beautiful
for
us
and
forget
who
as
we
wish
that
wish
becomes
our
there
can
be
no
healing
of
the
great
wound
in
the
body
of
mankind
till
each
one
of
us
would
die
rather
than
see
the
ugliness
of
a
wound
on
the
body
of
the
least
of
these
our
brethren
but
so
dulled
and
stupefied
is
our
sense
of
beauty
our
sense
of
brotherhood
that
our
brother
wounds
do
not
hurt
us
we
have
not
imagination
enough
to
know
how
it
feels
to
be
wounded
just
as
we
have
not
imagination
enough
to
see
the
green
fields
that
lie
crushed
where
manchester
sprawls
in
the
smoke
the
fair
hills
and
streams
on
which
has
grown
the
loathsome
fungus
of
stockport
illustration
of
lovely
hills
and
dales
now
i
do
believe
that
this
insensitiveness
to
ugliness
and
misery
this
blindness
to
wanton
befouling
of
human
life
and
the
green
world
comes
less
from
the
corruption
of
man
heart
than
from
the
emptiness
of
the
teaching
which
man
receives
when
he
is
good
and
little
and
a
child
the
teaching
in
our
schools
is
almost
wholly
materialistic
the
child
is
taught
the
botanical
name
of
the
orange
dissects
it
and
its
flower
and
perhaps
learns
the
latin
names
of
the
flower
and
fruit
but
it
is
not
taught
that
oranges
are
things
you
will
be
pleased
with
yourself
for
giving
up
to
some
one
who
is
thirstier
than
you
are
or
that
to
throw
on
the
pavement
where
some
one
may
slip
on
it
fall
and
hurt
himself
is
as
mean
a
trick
as
stealing
a
penny
from
a
blind
man
we
teach
the
children
about
the
wonders
of
gases
and
ethers
but
we
do
not
explain
to
them
that
furnaces
ought
to
consume
their
own
smoke
or
why
the
children
learn
of
acids
and
starches
but
not
that
it
is
a
disgraceful
thing
to
adulterate
beer
and
bread
the
rules
of
multiplication
and
subtraction
are
taught
in
schools
but
not
the
old
rule
if
any
will
not
work
neither
shall
he
eat
there
is
no
dogmatical
teaching
that
means
a
diet
of
dry
bones
it
means
that
the
child
is
never
shown
how
to
look
for
happiness
in
the
performance
of
acts
which
do
not
on
the
face
of
them
look
as
though
they
would
make
him
happy
it
is
not
explained
to
him
that
man
life
and
the
will
of
god
are
like
a
poem
god
writes
a
line
and
man
must
make
the
next
line
rhyme
to
it
when
it
does
rhyme
then
you
get
that
happiness
which
can
only
come
from
harmony
and
when
you
do
your
best
to
make
your
line
rhyme
and
can
not
well
the
author
of
the
first
line
knows
that
it
was
your
best
that
you
did
god
is
shown
when
he
is
shown
at
all
to
our
modern
children
as
a
sort
of
glorified
head
master
who
will
be
tremendously
down
on
you
if
you
break
the
rules
alternatively
as
a
sort
of
rich
uncle
who
will
give
you
things
if
you
ask
properly
he
is
not
shown
as
the
father
to
whom
you
can
tell
everything
if
you
are
successful
in
your
work
you
win
a
prize
and
go
home
to
your
people
and
tell
them
that
you
are
first
in
history
receiving
their
applause
without
shame
if
you
are
good
at
games
or
athletics
you
can
tell
your
mates
that
you
made
two
goals
or
runs
or
whatever
it
is
and
delight
in
their
admiration
if
you
are
an
athlete
the
applause
of
the
bystanders
is
your
right
and
your
reward
but
whom
can
you
tell
of
the
little
intimate
triumphs
the
secret
successes
the
temptations
resisted
the
kind
things
done
the
gentle
refrainings
the
noble
darings
of
that
struggling
bewildered
little
thing
you
call
your
soul
god
your
father
is
the
only
person
to
whom
you
can
talk
of
these
to
him
you
can
say
father
i
wanted
to
pay
smith
minor
out
for
something
he
did
last
week
and
i
did
because
i
thought
you
like
it
are
you
pleased
with
your
boy
do
they
teach
you
this
in
schools
or
give
you
any
hint
or
hope
of
what
you
will
feel
when
your
father
answers
yes
my
son
i
am
pleased
or
do
they
teach
you
to
say
father
i
am
sorry
i
was
a
beast
and
i
try
not
to
do
it
again
and
tell
you
that
a
voice
will
answer
i
am
sorry
too
my
son
but
i
am
glad
you
told
me
try
again
dear
lad
and
let
me
help
you
as
you
show
your
latin
exes
to
your
master
so
you
should
be
taught
to
show
the
leaves
of
your
life
to
the
only
one
who
can
read
and
understand
that
blotted
record
and
if
you
learn
to
show
that
book
every
day
there
will
be
less
and
less
in
it
that
you
mind
showing
and
more
and
more
that
will
give
you
the
glow
and
glory
of
the
heart
that
comes
to
him
who
hears
faithful
and
good
well
done
you
can
not
suppose
that
your
life
is
rhyming
with
the
will
of
god
when
you
destroy
the
beauty
of
the
country
and
of
the
lives
of
men
so
that
you
may
get
rich
and
you
and
your
children
may
live
without
working
can
you
imagine
a
company
promoter
who
should
say
father
i
have
made
a
lot
of
money
out
of
a
company
which
has
gone
to
pieces
and
a
lot
of
other
people
are
ruined
but
i
know
that
there
must
always
be
rich
and
poor
and
if
i
did
do
it
some
one
else
would
or
father
i
spoiled
the
green
fields
where
children
used
to
play
and
i
have
built
a
lot
of
streets
of
hideous
and
uncomfortable
houses
but
they
are
quite
good
enough
for
the
working
people
as
long
as
they
have
such
low
wages
they
ca
live
like
human
beings
and
thou
knowest
o
father
that
wages
are
and
must
be
regulated
by
the
divine
law
of
supply
and
demand
or
father
i
have
put
sand
in
the
sugar
and
poison
in
the
beer
alum
in
the
bread
and
water
in
the
milk
all
these
being
as
thou
knowest
father
trade
customs
men
can
say
these
things
to
themselves
and
to
each
other
but
there
is
one
to
whom
they
can
not
say
them
it
is
of
him
and
not
only
of
the
wonders
of
his
universe
that
i
would
have
the
children
taught
but
they
are
only
taught
of
the
wonders
not
of
the
it
is
not
that
there
are
none
who
could
teach
no
initiates
of
the
great
and
simple
mysteries
no
keepers
of
the
faith
there
are
such
but
they
are
muzzled
and
the
detestable
horrors
of
civilisation
go
on
in
a
community
which
calls
itself
after
the
name
of
christ
and
so
long
as
we
have
in
our
schools
this
materialistic
teaching
so
long
shall
we
raise
up
generation
after
generation
to
support
that
civilisation
and
to
keep
it
the
damnable
thing
we
know
talk
goes
on
and
goes
on
and
goes
on
there
is
talk
now
of
a
great
measure
for
the
reform
of
national
education
much
talk
there
will
be
more
there
will
be
much
ink
spilt
much
breath
wasted
we
shall
hear
of
montessori
and
froebel
and
pestalozzi
of
science
and
the
classics
of
opportunities
of
ladders
of
scholarships
and
prizes
and
endowments
we
shall
hear
how
hard
it
is
that
the
sons
of
the
plumber
should
not
be
able
to
go
to
oxford
and
how
desirable
it
is
that
daughters
of
the
dustman
should
sometimes
take
the
prix
de
rome
we
shall
be
told
how
important
are
the
telescope
and
the
microscope
and
how
right
it
is
that
children
should
know
all
about
their
little
insides
the
one
thing
we
shall
not
hear
about
will
be
the
one
thing
needful
a
tottering
government
may
keep
itself
in
power
by
such
a
measure
a
defeated
party
may
by
it
bring
itself
back
to
office
but
such
a
measure
will
not
keep
the
nation
from
perdition
nor
bring
back
the
soul
of
a
man
into
the
true
way
we
may
build
up
as
we
will
schemes
of
education
and
instruction
add
science
to
science
learning
to
learning
and
facts
to
facts
but
what
we
shall
build
will
be
only
a
dead
body
unless
it
be
informed
by
the
breath
of
the
spirit
which
maketh
alive
for
education
which
teaches
a
man
everything
but
how
to
live
to
the
glory
of
god
and
the
service
of
man
is
not
education
but
only
instruction
and
it
is
the
fruit
of
the
tree
not
of
life
but
of
death
chapter
i
romance
in
games
a
sharp
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
games
with
toys
and
games
without
them
in
the
latter
the
child
imagination
has
to
supply
everything
in
the
former
it
supplements
or
corrects
the
suggestion
of
the
toy
but
in
both
as
in
every
movement
and
desire
of
the
natural
child
it
is
imagination
which
tints
the
picture
and
makes
the
whole
enterprise
worth
while
in
that
oldest
of
games
and
still
more
in
its
sister
i
spy
a
little
live
streak
of
fear
brought
down
from
who
knows
what
wild
ancestry
lends
to
the
game
an
excitement
not
to
be
found
in
games
with
bats
and
balls
and
nets
and
bails
and
straightforward
trappings
bought
at
shops
when
you
lurk
in
the
shrubbery
ready
to
spring
out
on
the
one
who
is
hunting
you
and
to
become
in
your
turn
the
hunter
you
are
no
longer
a
child
you
are
a
red
indian
or
a
canadian
settler
or
a
tiger
or
a
according
to
the
measure
of
your
dreams
and
the
nature
of
the
latest
book
of
your
reading
at
this
point
it
occurs
to
me
that
perhaps
you
who
read
may
have
forgotten
the
difference
between
and
i
spy
is
just
what
it
says
it
is
half
the
players
hide
and
the
others
seek
them
and
there
an
end
of
it
it
is
an
interesting
game
but
flat
compared
with
i
spy
it
has
however
this
merit
that
it
can
be
played
without
those
screams
to
which
are
usually
so
averse
whereas
i
defy
any
one
to
play
i
spy
without
screaming
is
a
calm
game
the
thing
sought
for
might
almost
as
well
be
an
inanimate
object
it
is
the
game
of
stoats
looking
for
eggs
of
bears
looking
for
honey
but
i
spy
is
the
game
of
enemy
looking
for
enemy
it
calls
for
the
virtues
of
fortitude
endurance
courage
for
the
splendours
of
physical
fitness
for
aptness
for
speed
in
i
spy
half
the
players
hide
and
the
others
seek
but
they
seek
not
an
unresisting
stationary
object
but
a
keen
watchful
retaliatory
terror
they
seek
in
shrubbery
and
garden
behind
and
conservatory
in
the
shelter
of
tree
hedge
and
arbour
for
the
enemy
and
when
that
enemy
is
found
the
seeker
does
not
just
say
oh
here
you
are
that
ending
the
game
far
otherwise
the
seeker
in
i
spy
goes
warily
his
heart
in
his
mouth
for
the
moment
he
sees
a
hider
he
must
shout
i
spy
adding
the
hider
name
i
spy
jimmy
he
cries
and
turning
flees
at
his
best
speed
the
hidden
one
follows
after
the
hunted
becoming
in
one
swift
terrible
transition
the
hunter
and
he
who
was
the
seeker
flies
with
all
the
speed
he
may
across
country
to
the
appointed
home
the
quarry
unearthed
has
become
the
pursuer
and
follows
with
yells
would
always
rather
that
you
played
and
can
you
wonder
but
sometimes
they
will
concede
to
you
i
spy
rights
and
even
join
in
the
sport
it
is
always
well
in
playing
any
game
where
anything
may
be
trampled
such
as
asparagus
beds
or
broken
such
as
windows
to
have
a
or
two
on
your
side
and
by
your
here
of
course
i
mean
children
the
habit
of
years
is
not
easily
broken
and
i
am
so
much
more
used
to
writing
children
than
them
chevy
chase
is
a
good
game
of
courage
and
adventure
does
any
one
play
it
now
no
child
can
play
it
who
does
not
know
who
it
was
who
when
his
legs
were
smitten
off
he
fought
upon
his
stumps
and
to
what
bold
heart
the
bitterest
drop
in
the
cup
of
defeat
was
earl
percy
sees
my
face
all
wreathed
with
romance
are
the
nuts
in
may
there
came
three
knights
and
the
rest
where
the
dancing
movement
and
the
song
of
ends
in
a
hard
jolly
and
woe
to
the
vanquished
this
is
a
very
old
game
and
there
are
many
words
to
it
one
set
i
know
but
i
never
have
known
the
end
little
boys
in
light
trousers
and
short
jackets
and
little
girls
in
narrow
frilled
gowns
used
to
play
it
on
the
village
green
a
hundred
years
ago
this
is
how
it
began
up
and
down
the
green
grass
this
and
that
and
thus
come
along
my
pretty
maid
and
take
a
walk
with
us
you
shall
have
a
duck
my
dear
and
you
shall
have
a
drake
and
you
shall
have
a
handsome
man
for
your
father
sake
my
mother
told
me
all
of
that
and
that
is
all
of
it
that
i
can
remember
she
always
said
she
would
write
it
down
and
i
always
thought
there
was
plenty
of
time
and
somehow
there
was
not
and
so
i
do
not
know
the
end
perhaps
charles
marson
who
first
found
out
the
somerset
of
which
somebody
else
now
so
mysteriously
gets
all
the
credit
may
know
the
end
of
these
verses
if
he
does
and
if
he
sees
this
perhaps
he
will
write
and
tell
me
this
game
of
come
and
go
and
give
and
take
is
alive
in
france
witness
the
old
song
qui
passe
ici
si
tard
compagnons
de
la
marjolaine
qui
passe
ici
si
tard
toujours
si
gai
ce
sont
les
cavaliers
du

compagnons
de
la
marjolaine
ce
sont
les
cavaliers
du
roi
toujours
si
gais
et
que
veulent
ces
cavaliers
compagnons
de
la
marjolaine
et
que
veulent

des
jeunes

à
marier

de
la
marjolaine
des
jeunes

si
gais
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
stout
dutch
children
and
german
children
with
flaxen
plaits
and
small
contadine
and
spanish
and
swedish
and
russian
and
lithuanian
babes
all
move
rhythmically
back
and
forth
on
their
native
greensward
and
rehearse
the
old
story
of
the
fair
maid
and
the
knight
out
to
marry
the
mulberry
bush
is
another
of
the
old
where
is
the
soul
of
the
adventure
and
this
too
is
everywhere
a
la
claire
fontaine
i
remember
as
the
french
version
danced
on
wet
days
in
the
cloisters
of
the
convent
of
my
youth
le
pont
a
glorious
game
with
its
impersonations
of
animals
has
as
far
as
i
know
no
counterpart
in
this
country
all
these
games
are
active
games
they
can
of
course
be
played
by
sheer
imitation
a
sort
of
aptitude
will
do
it
but
if
they
are
to
be
enjoyed
to
the
full
the
imagination
must
have
full
play
to
a
knight
to
fetch
a
fair
lady
is
quite
simple
and
quite
thrilling
just
as
to
be
a
bear
demands
nothing
but
growls
and
a
plantigrade
activity
in
the
performer
to
be
a
fearful
joy
to
the
cricket
and
football
fives
and
racquets
the
games
that
are
played
with
things
out
of
shops
do
not
need
imagination
to
help
them
out
the
games
without
bought
accessories
should
perhaps
rather
be
termed
plays
than
games
and
the
more
highly
cultivated
the
imagination
the
more
intensely
joyous
are
the
games
all
sorts
of
acting
and
pretending
games
depend
entirely
on
the
imagination
and
it
is
well
to
encourage
children
to
act
scenes
which
they
have
observed
or
heard
about
or
read
about
the
smallest
child
will
experience
a
real
joy
in
putting
its
pinafore
on
wrong
way
round
call
it
a
coat
and
announce
with
pride
that
it
is
daddy
going
a
tata
in
the
dolls
you
will
observe
a
careful
copy
or
travesty
of
your
own
company
manners
and
as
the
small
minds
are
filled
with
tales
of
wonder
and
adventure
you
will
find
them
the
nursery
rocking
chair
serving
as
charger
for
the
gallant
knight
and
hassock
taking
quite
adequately
the
part
of
the
dragon
a
small
sister
can
generally
be
relied
on
to
be
the
captive

especially
if

told

the
story
of

the

should

are
due
all

if
unfortunate

not

fairy
tales

will

will

alice

an

how
beloved
will
be
the
who
passing
by

scene
shall
refrain
from
commenting
on
the
deafening
groans
of
the
patient
and
shall
instead
offer
the
physician
a
ribbon
for
his
girdle
or
a
plume
from
the
dusting
brush
for
his
turban
exploring
plays
and
all
the
plays
which
include
wigwams
and
war
paint
are
such
as
an
intelligent
will
be
able
to
intensify
and
add
backbone
to
for
a
child
fancy
will
naturally
outrun
his
performance
and
though
he
may
imagine
a
feather
or
moccasins
he
will
be
only
too
pleased
that
a
should
make
the
things
for
him
with
that
strong
unerring
touch
to
which
his
small
experimenting
hands
can
not
yet
attain
all
such
games
require
numbers
your
only
lonely
child
can
not
play
indians
to
the
full
two
is
better
than
one
and
more
than
two
is
better
than
two
up
to
the
number
of
six
or
eight
people
do
seem
to
see
how
important
numbers
are
for
play
they
see
it
fast
enough
when
it
comes
to
schools
but
a
regular
association
of
children
for
the
purposes
of
play
is
not
encouraged
in
a
large
family
of
boys
and
girls
it
just
happens
happily
but
an
association
of
children
from
various
homes
generally
means
a
predatory
horde
of
boys
girls
associate
with
unrelated
girls
in
joyous
and
boys
are
apt
to
think
that
little
girls
who
are
not
their
sisters
are
either
angels
or
muffs
and
neither
a
muff
nor
an
angel
is
what
you
want
to
play
games
with
parents
and
guardians
might
do
a
great
deal
to
render
possible
i
suggest
that
house
parties
of
children
where
the
utmost
possible
liberty
should
be
given
would
stimulate
enormously
the
plays
which
encourage
daring
and
initiative
and
would
teach
boys
that
girls
are
not
necessarily
muffs
or
angels
and
teach
girls
that
boys
are
not
all
brutes
fathers
and
mothers
sacrifice
themselves
every
year
in
august
you
see
them
doing
it
heavily
definitely
with
clenched
teeth
and
a
grim
determination
not
to
be
selfish
and
to
spend
a
month
with
the
children
at
the
seaside
however
much
it
may
cost
in
time
temper
and
money
the
browns
go
to
scarborough
their
friends
the
robinsons
go
to
wales
the
smiths
are
in
devonshire
and
the
joneses
at
littlehampton
they
all
go
to
the
same
sort
of
lodgings
do
the
same
sort
of
things
and
lucky
is
the
mother
whose
nerves
are
not
worn
very
thin
indeed
before
the
holiday
ends
now
suppose
all
these
worthy
and
parents
agreed
to
pool
their
families
and
let
and
brown
take
charge
of
them
all
in
some
jolly
big
house
suited
to
the
needs
of
so
swollen
a
household
sixteen
children
are
really
in
many
ways
four
times
easier
to
manage
than
four
and
at
least
forty
times
as
easy
to
amuse
in
fact
you
do
need
to
amuse
them
they
will
amuse
themselves
and
each
other
and
brown
will
only
have
to
adjust
ebullitions
meanwhile
the
smiths
robinsons
and
joneses
are
having
their
holiday
where
they
will
their
turn
of
having
the
children
will
come
another
year
when
the
browns
will
be
free
to
range
the
world
in
august
knowing
that
their
children
are
safe
and
happy
and
are
thank
you
having
a
much
better
time
than
they
could
have
in
small
seaside
lodgings
even
with
the
undivided
attention
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
besides
if
i
may
for
once
take
the
part
of
the
mothers
instead
of
that
of
the
children
what
sort
of
holiday
do
you
think
the
mother
has
when
to
the
ordinary
routine
of
housekeeping
at
home
are
added
the
difficulties
of
housekeeping
in
unfamiliar
surroundings
in
a
house
of
whose
capabilities
she
has
no
experience
and
with
a
landlady
whose
temper
as
often
as
not
is
as
short
as
her
tale
of
extras
is
long
the
woman
who
works
all
the
year
round
at
the
incredibly
arduous
task
of
making
a
home
answering
week
in
and
week
out
the
constant
varying
demands
on
all
her
complex
mental
and
physical
activities
does
really
deserve
a
real
holiday
what
is
more
she
needs
it
she
will
be
a
better
mother
the
rest
of
the
year
if
she
be
allowed
for
that
one
month
to
be
just
a
wife
and
a
wife
on
a
holiday
the
wife
whose
turn
it
is
to
take
charge
of
the
amalgamated
families
will
find
so
great
a
change
from
the
exclusive
care
of
her
own
chickens
that
the
change
in
itself
will
be
a
sort
of
holiday
and
the
children
themselves
perhaps
will
learn
a
little
from
the
enforced
separation
from
the
fount
of
unselfish
devotion
and
appreciate
their
mother
all
the
more
if
they
have
be
it
only
missed
her
a
little
even
through
the
varied
and
joyous
experiences
of
their
month
chapter
ii
building
cities
the
devotion
of
aunts
has
often
stirred
my
admiration
the
heroism
of
aunts
deserves
an
epic
but
this
is
as
you
say
not
the
place
to
write
that
epic
give
me
leave
however
to
say
that
of
all
the
heroic
acts
of
the
devoted
aunt
none
seems
to
me
more
magnificent
than
the
which
nerves
those
delightful
ladies
to
settle
themselves
down
to
play
in
cold
blood
with
their
nephews
and
nieces
games
bought
at
a
shop
games
in
boxes
i
am
not
talking
of
croquet
or
even
badminton
though
these
may
be
and
are
bought
in
boxes
at
shops
nor
do
i
wish
to
depreciate
chess
and
draughts
nor
even
halma
the
poor
relation
of
draughts
and
chess
nor
dominoes
which
we
all
love
these
games
so
precious
on
wet
days
or
when
other
people
have
headaches
can
not
be
too
highly
prized
too
assiduously
cultivated
the
rigours
of
the
seaside
holiday
too
often
in
wet
weather
a
time
of
trial
and
temper
would
be
considerably
mitigated
if
chess
and
draughts
dominoes
and
halma
were
packed
in
the
trunks
along
with
the
serge
suits
the
sandshoes
and
the
the
games
which
i
do
so
and
admire
to
see
aunts
playing
are
the
meaningless
games
with
counters
and
dice
dice
and
roughly
turned
counters
and
boards
that
look
like
folding
till
you
open
them
and
then
you
find
all
the
ugliest
colours
divided
into
squares
and
circles
or
slabs
with
snakes
or
motors
or
some
other
unpleasing
devices
on
them
these
games
are
all
exactly
the
same
in
their
primary
qualities
the
first
of
them
that
was
invented
had
all
the
faults
of
all
its
successors
yet
dozens
of
new
ones
are
invented
every
year
just
to
sell
and
helpless
children
try
to
play
them
knowing
no
better
and
angel
aunts
abet
them
knowing
all
suffer
a
great
deal
in
playing
with
children
it
is
not
the
least
charm
of
a
magic
city
that
a
can
play
it
and
suffer
nothing
worse
than
the
fatigue
incidental
to
the
bricklayer
calling
of
course
most
will
say
that
they
would
rather
be
burnt
at
a
slow
fire
or
play
halma
than
be
bothered
with
magic
cities
but
that
is
only
because
they
do
not
understand
try
the
experiment
the
next
time
you
are
spending
a
wet
in
a
country
house
where
there
are
children
get
the
children
to
yourself
and
ask
your
hostess
whether
you
may
borrow
what
you
want
for
a
game
the
library
is
the
best
place
for
building
there
is
almost
certainly
a
large
and
steady
table
also
there
are
the
books
i
need
not
urge
you
to
spare
the
elegantly
bound
volumes
and
the
prized
first
editions
and
the
priceless
folios
and
duodecimos
in
their
original
calf
and
vellum
you
will
find
plenty
of
books
that
nobody
will
mind
your
using
the
old
bound
volumes
of
the
and
good
solid
blocks
for
the
foundations
of
your
city
if
there
be
a
pair
of
candlesticks
or
an
inkstand
which
match
you
may
make
a
magnificent
archway
by
setting
up
the
candlesticks
as
pillars
and
laying
the
inkstand
on
the
top
you
can
see
how
this
is
done
in
the
picture
of
the
elephant
temple
get
the
children
to
bring
down
the
bricks
and
enlist
a
friendly
to
let
you
have
the
run
of
the
china
cupboard
or
a
footman
if
you
are
in
that
sort
of
house
to
bring
you
the
things
you
want
on
a
tray
illustration
the
palace
of
cats
but
it
is
much
better
if
you
can
go
alone
over
the
house
and
choose
what
you
really
want
you
invite
the
children
to
help
you
build
and
to
build
themselves
if
they
have
never
built
a
magic
city
you
will
find
that
they
will
presently
desert
their
plain
brick
edifices
to
watch
the
development
of
your
palace
or
temple
they
will
offer
suggestions
and
quite
soon
they
will
offer
objects
they
will
begin
to
look
about
the
room
with
their
sharp
eyes
and
about
the
house
with
their
keen
memory
and
imagination
and
produce
the
sort
of
things
that
look
like
the
sort
of
things
they
think
you
might
like
for
your
building
they
will
wander
off
returning
with
little
boxes
shells
and
would
this
do
for
something
is
the
word
on
every
lip
they
are
soon
as
much
absorbed
in
the
building
as
you
are
and
i
take
it
you
are
an
enthusiast
and
your
magic
city
grows
apace
then
after
a
little
while
a
bored
and
out
of
employment
will
stray
into
the
library
with
hullo
what
are
you
kids
up
to
with
all
this
rubbish
and
stand
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
contemplating
the
building
industry
if
you
answer
him
simply
and
kindly
and
do
resent
his
choice
of
epithet
it
is
almost
certain
he
will
quite
soon
withdraw
a
hand
from
his
pocket
and
reach
out
to
touch
your
magic
walls
with
would
it
be
better
like
that
admit
it
and
in
hardly
any
time
at
all
you
have
him
building
on
his
own
account
another
will
stray
in
presently
with
the
same
question
on
his
lips
he
too
will
come
to
be
bored
and
will
remain
to
build
and
by
you
will
have
collected
every
of
the
every
that
is
to
say
with
the
right
feeling
for
cities
it
will
surprise
you
to
find
how
keen
you
will
yourself
become
as
the
work
goes
on
and
how
it
will
call
into
play
all
your
invention
and
your
latent
craftsmanship
you
will
be
amazed
at
the
results
you
can
achieve
with
quite
materials
and
still
more
will
you
be
surprised
at
the
increasing
interest
and
skill
of
the
when
it
is
time
to
dress
for
dinner
you
will
feel
a
pang
of
positive
despair
at
the
thought
that
your
beautiful
city
the
child
of
your
dreams
and
skill
must
be
taken
down
it
is
like
the
end
of
the
magic
of
cinderella
when
her
coach
became
a
pumpkin
her
horses
mice
and
her
coachman
a
fat
rat
now
your
domes
are
once
more
mere
basins
your
fountain
basins
are
your
fountains
are
but
silver
and
their
gleaming
waters
only
strips
of
the
that
comes
off
chocolate
or
cigarettes
the
walls
of
your
palaces
go
back
into
the
and
their
façades
return
to
the
dull
obscurity
of
the
the
doors
and
the
animals
who
stood
on
guard
at
the
and
terraces
on
plinths
or
pillars
share
in
the
dark
rattling
seclusion
where
many
a
wooden
tail
has
been
broken
many
a
painted
ear
lost
for
ever
but
the
tidying
up
has
to
be
done
unless
your
hostess
is
one
of
those
rare
and
delightful
people
who
see
what
their
guests
like
and
lets
them
do
it
in
that
case
she
may
say
oh
what
a
pity
to
disturb
the
pretty
thing
why
not
let
your
city
stay
for
a
day
or
two
so
that
the
children
can
build
some
more
to
it
no
of
course
it
wo
be
in
the
way
and
would
it
be
pretty
if
we
lighted
it
up
with
fairy
lights
after
dark
then
your
city
really
has
a
chance
the
children
will
think
of
it
till
and
fall
asleep
in
the
happy
throes
of
their
first
you
may
think
that
i
exaggerate
the
charms
of
magic
cities
because
i
happened
to
invent
them
and
you
may
be
afraid
that
my
swan
if
you
ever
make
up
your
mind
to
adopt
it
may
turn
out
to
be
an
ugly
and
dispiriting
duckling
i
assure
you
this
is
not
so
i
have
never
met
a
child
who
did
not
like
building
magic
cities
and
not
many
of
course
the
love
of
them
grows
like
other
loves
and
the
longer
you
can
keep
the
city
standing
the
fonder
you
and
your
playmates
will
get
of
it
it
will
grow
more
and
more
finished
in
detail
and
the
ugly
will
be
reorganised
and
made
neat
with
an
irreproachable
neatness
if
the
magic
city
game
were
played
in
schools
as
i
think
it
ought
to
be
a
long
table
or
series
of
tables
could
easily
be
kept
for
it
and
the
city
kept
standing
and
be
added
to
from
day
to
day
but
it
will
not
be
the
same
sort
of
city
as
the
one
you
build
in
the
house
where
the
lives
and
still
less
the
sort
that
happens
in
the
house
where
there
is
a
butler
and
many
silver
boxes
and
cups
and
candlesticks
now
i
come
to
write
all
this
down
it
seems
very
trivial
and
it
will
perhaps
seem
even
more
so
when
i
come
to
tell
you
about
the
different
things
we
made
and
used
for
magic
cities
but
it
is
not
really
trivial
i
do
not
think
i
claim
for
the
magic
city
game
more
than
it
justifies
and
i
will
tell
you
presently
why
i
think
this
of
course
when
you
have
finished
your
city
if
you
ever
do
finish
it
you
make
up
stories
about
it
and
always
even
when
you
are
building
it
you
imagine
how
splendid
it
would
be
if
you
were
small
enough
to
walk
through
the
arches
of
your
city
gates
to
run
along
the
little
corridors
of
your
city
palaces
of
course
it
would
do
quite
as
well
if
your
city
became
big
enough
for
you
to
run
about
in
while
still
keeping
your
natural
size
but
it
is
somehow
not
really
so
cosy
to
think
of
when
i
had
built
my
first
three
or
four
magic
cities
this
idea
of
getting
into
the
city
being
of
course
correct
lived
with
me
so
much
that
i
wrote
a
about
it
called
magic
a
in
which
a
boy
and
girl
do
really
become
the
right
size
and
enter
into
the
city
they
have
built
they
have
there
all
the
adventures
whose
wraiths
danced
before
me
when
i
was
building
courts
and
making
palm
trees
and
finding
out
the
many
fine
and
fair
uses
of
cowries
and
this
book
magic
produced
a
curious
effect
i
hope
i
shall
not
look
conceited
because
really
i
am
only
proud
when
i
say
that
about
my
books
i
have
had
the
dearest
letters
from
children
saying
pretty
things
about
the
stories
in
the
prettiest
way
it
is
one
of
the
most
things
in
the
world
to
get
these
letters
and
to
answer
them
and
if
i
had
letters
like
these
i
should
have
been
only
pleased
and
not
disturbed
but
the
letters
about
the
magic
city
though
they
were
full
of
the
pretty
awkward
delicious
things
that
children
write
to
the
author
of
the
books
they
like
held
something
else
a
demand
severe
and
almost
unanimous
to
know
how
magic
cities
were
built
and
whether
children
like
us
could
build
one
and
if
so
how
i
got
so
many
of
these
letters
that
i
decided
to
build
a
magic
city
where
any
child
in
london
at
any
rate
could
come
and
see
it
and
i
built
it
at
the
children
welfare
exhibition
which
the
arranged
last
year
at
olympia
the
history
of
that
building
would
make
a
largish
and
intimate
volume
the
difficulties
that
beset
a
when
she
goes
out
into
the
world
the
anguish
of
misunderstandings
which
arise
between
the
builder
of
magic
cities
and
the
people
who
lay
linoleum
and
put
up
electric
lights
the
confusion
which
results
from
having
packed
in
boxes
and
all
mixed
up
the
building
materials
which
you
are
accustomed
to
look
for
as
you
need
them
in
your
own
home
the
extraordinary
mass
of
people
the
extraordinary
kindness
of
people
for
after
all
it
is
the
kindness
which
stands
out
it
is
true
that
the
gentleman
who
very
much
isolated
fixed
the
electric
lights
behaved
exactly
like
an
earthquake
upsetting
two
temples
a
palace
and
a
tank
with
an
educated
seal
in
it
but
then
how
more
than
a
brother
was
the
man
who
did
the
whitewash
it
is
true
that
the
dictator
with
the
linoleum
but
i
will
not
remember
these
things
let
me
remember
how
many
good
friends
i
found
among
the
keepers
of
the
stalls
how
a
great
personage
of
the
came
with
his
wife
at
the
last
despairing
moment
and
lent
me
the
golden
and
ruby
lamps
from
their
how
the
boy
scouts
put
themselves
in
four
to
get
me
some
for
roofs
of
cottages
how
their
scout
master
gave
me
fourteen
beautiful
little
ivory
fishes
with
black
eyes
to
put
in
my
silver
paper
ponds
how
the
on
the
one
side
and
the
home
hobbies
on
the
other
were
to
me
as
brothers
how
the
cherry
blossom
boot
polish
lady
gave
me
hairpins
and
the
wardens
of
bookstall
gave
me
friendship
how
the
gifted
for
the
plasticine
stall
moved
by
sheer
rushed
over
one
day
and
dumped
a
gorgeous
prehistoric
beast
modelled
by
his
own
hands
in
the
sands
about
my
siberian
tomb
how
the
queen
of
portugal
came
and
talked
to
me
for
half
an
hour
in
the
most
flattering
french
while
the
deity
from
the
looked
on
benign
these
are
things
i
can
never
forget
when
the
show
opened
i
was
feeling
like
a
snail
who
has
inadvertently
come
out
without
his
shell
think
how
all
this
kindness
comforted
and
protected
me
and
then
came
the
long
stream
of
visitors
crowds
of
them
i
do
know
how
many
thousands
who
came
and
looked
at
my
magic
city
and
asked
questions
and
looked
and
looked
at
it
looked
and
said
things
it
is
because
of
what
they
said
that
i
am
writing
about
that
show
at
all
they
all
liked
the
city
except
two
and
i
can
not
think
that
those
two
were
in
other
respects
really
nice
people
and
more
than
half
of
them
asked
whether
i
would
not
write
a
book
about
the
magic
city
which
i
had
built
there
and
which
lay
looking
so
real
and
romantic
under
the
soft
glow
of
the
tinted
lamps
not
a
but
a
book
to
tell
other
people
how
to
make
such
cities
and
i
said
i
would
tell
all
i
knew
in
a
book
and
when
i
came
to
write
i
found
that
there
were
many
other
things
that
i
wanted
to
write
about
children
and
other
things
than
magic
cities
and
i
wrote
them
and
this
is
the
book
and
the
reason
i
am
telling
you
all
this
is
that
my
big
magic
city
at
olympia
showed
me
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
that
the
building
of
magic
cities
interests
practically
every
one
young
or
old
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
all
this
and
yet
not
to
feel
that
you
will
think
that
i
am
boasting
about
my
magic
city
but
i
want
you
to
believe
that
it
was
very
beautiful
and
that
you
can
build
one
just
as
beautiful
or
much
more
beautiful
if
you
care
to
try
it
it
is
such
an
easy
game
every
one
can
play
it
and
every
one
likes
it
even
quite
old
people
by
the
way
i
have
been
asked
to
build
another
city
at
olympia
in
april
and
i
hope
that
it
will
be
a
prettier
one
even
than
the
other
which
i
loved
so

iii
bricks
and
other
things
it
is
a
mistake
when
you
are
going
to
build
a
city
to
make
too
large
a
collection
of
building
materials
before
you
begin
to
build
if
it
is
natural
to
you
to
express
yourself
by
pencil
lines
on
paper
you
might
perhaps
draw
an
outline
of
the
masses
of
your
city
as
you
see
them
in
the
architect
vision
or
illumination
which
should
precede
all
building
either
of
magic
cities
or
municipal
having
roughly
indicated
on
paper
the
general
shape
of
your
city
as
you
look
at
it
from
the
front
the
shape
it
would
have
against
the
western
sky
at
dusk
i
think
architects
call
this
the
elevation
do
they
you
proceed
to
collect
such
material
as
will
roughly
indicate
that
shape
on
the
table
or
other
and
here
let
me
once
more
warn
the
builder
new
to
his
business
not
to
be
trapped
by
the
splendid
obvious
bait
of
floor
wide
space
to
build
palaces
while
prone
on
the
stomach
may
be
natural
and
easy
to
extreme
youth
to
people
it
is
agonising
and
impossible
the
floor
has
only
two
qualifications
as
a
building
site
it
is
large
larger
at
least
than
any
of
the
pieces
of
furniture
which
stand
on
it
and
it
is
flat
and
when
you
have
said
that
you
have
said
all
whereas
the
inconveniences
of
the
floor
as
a
place
for
building
are
innumerable
the
floor
is
draughty
it
is
inaccessible
except
from
the
attitude
of
the
serpent
and
the
serpent
attitude
even
if
rich
in
a
certain
lax
comfort
is
most
unfavourable
for
the
steady
use
of
both
hands
if
you
want
to
see
how
unfavourable
assume
that
attitude
and
try
to
build
a
on
the
floor
you
can
not
do
it
if
you
kneel
well
you
know
how
hard
the
floor
gets
if
you
kneel
on
it
for
quite
a
little
time
if
you
sit
or
squat
your
dress
or
your
insist
on
playing
at
earthquakes
with
your
building
also
the
city
on
the
floor
is
liable
to
hostile
invasion
by
cats
or
dogs
or
servants
to
the
crushing
and
scattering
by
outsiders
or
people
who
rush
into
the
room
to
look
for
something
in
a
hurry
think
of
a
playful
elephant
in
some
eastern
court
of
carved
pearl
and
ivory
lattice
an
elephant
with
one
of
the
more
fanciful
volcanic
eruptions
and
your
conception
will
pale
into
placidity
in
the
face
of
the
spectacle
of
a
normal
puppy
in
a
city
and
on
the
floor
things
not
only
get
broken
they
get
lost
cotton
reels
roll
under
sofas
draughts
bowl
away
into
obscurity
and
are
only
found
next
day
by
the
housemaid
when
she
moves
the
fender
and
not
then
as
often
as
not
chess
kings
are
walked
on
and
get
their
crowns
chipped
card
counters
disappear
for
ever
and
it
is
quite
impossible
for
you
to
keep
an
eye
on
your
materials
when
you
are
grovelling
among
them
therefore
build
on
a
table
or
tables
tables
of
different
shapes
heights
and
sizes
make
beautiful
sites
for
cities
and
bureaux
are
good
if
you
may
take
the
drawers
out
and
empty
the
i
remember
a
wonderful
city
we
made
once
it
was
called
the
city
of
the
thousand
lights
and
it
was
built
on
a
bureau
two
large
tables
and
three
other
smaller
ones
all
connected
by
bridges
in
the
handsomest
way
the
lids
of
the
brick
boxes
make
excellent
bridges
and
you
can
adorn
them
to
your
fancy
and
make
impressive
at
each
end
the
bureau
was
the
temple
of
mung
and
we
sacrificed
a
pale
pink
animal
from
the
noah
ark
at
the
shrine
of
this
the
most
mysterious
of
the
gods
of
pegana
the
thousand
lights
there
were
not
a
thousand
really
but
there
were
many
luminous
towers
with
windows
of
a
still
brighter
glow
you
make
them
by
putting
a
in
a
tumbler
a
little
water
first
by
way
of
fire
insurance
and
surrounding
the
tumbler
by
a
sheet
of
paper
with
windows
and
battlements
and
fixed
to
a
cylindrical
shape
by
pins
the
paper
cylinders
are
of
course
fitted
on
outside
the
tumblers
so
that
there
is
no
danger
of
fire
all
the
same
it
is
better
to
let
a
do
the
luminous
towers
illustration
guarded
arch
having
chosen
your
site
and
blocked
out
the
mass
of
your
buildings
you
begin
to
collect
the
building
material
for
my
own
part
i
see
the
city
i
am
going
to
build
in
the
eye
of
the
mind
or
of
the
heart
so
vividly
and
consistently
that
i
never
need
to
make
notes
of
it
on
paper
i
know
when
what
i
am
building
is
not
in
accord
with
the
vision
and
then
i
pull
it
down
truly
in
accord
it
never
really
is
but
it
approximates
now
when
you
have
seen
the
silhouette
of
your
city
and
begin
to
look
for
stuff
to
build
with
you
will
instantly
find
that
everything
you
can
lay
your
hands
on
is
too
small
the
bricks
even
the
boxes
which
contained
them
are
suited
for
the
detailed
building
which
is
to
come
later
but
now
you
want
something
at
once
bigger
and
less
conventionally
proportioned
now
is
the
time
to
look
for
boxes
not
the
carved
boxes
in
which
aunts
keep
their
pins
nor
the
smooth
cedarwood
boxes
in
which
uncles
buy
their
cigars
though
both
these
are
excellent
when
you
come
to
the
details
of
your
work
but
for
the
mass
you
want
real
big
boxes
if
you
have
a
large
table
or
tables
sugar
boxes
are
not
too
large
also
there
are
the
boxes
in
which
starch
is
packed
and
cocoa
and
the
flatter
boxes
which
the
lady
at
the
will
give
you
if
she
likes
you
and
sell
to
you
for
a
penny
anyhow
the
boxes
in
which
your
father
gets
his
collars
and
the
boxes
in
which
your
mother
gets
her
chocolates
though
not
really
large
should
be
collected
at
the
same
time
because
they
need
the
same
treatment
i
am
assuming
now
that
you
are
not
building
a
city
for
an
afternoon
amusement
but
one
for
which
you
have
found
a
safe
resting
place
a
city
that
may
take
days
to
build
and
will
not
be
disturbed
for
days
if
you
can
once
found
your
city
in
a
safe
place
and
you
are
working
at
it
day
after
day
you
will
go
on
thinking
of
more
and
more
things
to
be
added
to
it
and
it
will
grow
in
beauty
under
your
hands
as
naturally
as
a
flower
under
the
hand
of
summer
illustration
boxes
you
have
now
your
collection
of
boxes
but
they
are
of
plain
rough
wood
and
probably
disfigured
by
coarse
coloured
printed
papers
telling
what
the
boxes
once
held
these
papers
you
wash
off
and
when
the
boxes
are
clean
and
dry
you
paint
or
them
to
suit
your
requirements
now
your
requirements
are
large
blocks
of
colours
to
match
your
bricks
and
bricks
are
of
three
colours
white
and
stone
colour
the
stone
bricks
are
stone
colour
and
oak
bricks
are
very
nearly
stone
colour
and
there
are
bricks
to
these
three
i
would
add
a
dark
brown
and
as
this
dark
brown
is
not
sold
in
boxes
at
the
shops
you
had
better
colour
some
of
your
bricks
with
it
for
yourself
dark
wood
in
a
city
gives
a
wonderful
richness
and
helps
the
lighter
colours
more
than
you
would
think
possible
a
city
in
which
some
buildings
are
of
dark
wood
will
have
an
air
of
reality
never
achieved
by
a
city
where
all
is
red
or
white
or
stone
colour
by
the
way
among
the
stone
bricks
there
are
some
blue
ones
but
you
will
always
have
enough
of
them
for
they
are
the
last
things
you
will
ever
want
to
use
your
boxes
then
must
be
coloured
either
white
red
stone
colour
or
dark
brown
in
the
white
use
either
white
paint
flat
not
shining
or
if
that
cost
too
much
trouble
and
money
whitewash
made
of
whitening
size
hot
water
and
a
pinch
of
yellow
ochre
or
chrome
powder
to
give
it
a
pleasant
ivory
creaminess
there
should
be
a
good
deal
of
size
so
that
the
whitewash
does
not
come
off
on
every
thing
the
red
boxes
can
be
painted
to
match
the
red
bricks
or
whitewash
as
before
but
red
ochre
for
colour
stone
colour
is
not
a
very
satisfactory
tint
and
too
much
of
it
makes
for
gloom
the
lids
and
bottoms
of
the
brick
boxes
will
generally
give
you
as
much
of
it
as
you
want
but
if
you
desire
stone
colour
you
can
make
it
by
putting
a
pinch
of
raw
umber
in
the
whitewash
or
you
can
paint
your
boxes
with
this
uninteresting
tint
resembling
the
doors
of
back
kitchens
with
these
paints
or
you
can
make
your
odd
boxes
into
blocks
to
match
your
bricks
and
not
only
wooden
but
cardboard
boxes
can
be
treated
in
this
way
all
these
colours
can
be
bought
in
gigantic
at
the
but
when
i
come
to
the
dark
brown
which
i
confess
is
my
favourite
colour
no
cardboard
box
will
serve
your
turn
you
must
choose
clean
smooth
wood
because
the
brown
colouring
is
transparent
and
the
grain
will
show
through
your
bricks
will
be
smooth
enough
and
if
the
boxes
are
not
smooth
a
little
will
soon
subdue
their
rough
exterior
i
suppose
you
know
how
to
use
if
you
just
rub
with
your
fingers
you
hurt
your
fingers
and
do
make
much
progress
the
best
way
is
to
wrap
the
round
a
flat
piece
of
wood
a
wooden
brick
will
do
and
rub
with
that
when
your
wood
is
all
smooth
you
mix
your
stain
and
here
i
make
a
present
to
all
housewives
of
the
best
floor
stain
in
the
world
get
a
tin
of
brunswick
black
the
kind
you
put
on
stoves
and
some
turpentine
mix
a
little
of
the
black
and
a
little
of
the
turpentine
in
a
pot
and
try
it
on
the
wood
with
a
smooth
brush
a
flat
brush
is
the
best
till
you
have
the
colour
you
want
always
remembering
that
it
will
be
a
little
lighter
when
it
is
dry
when
you
have
decided
on
the
colour
paint
your
bricks
and
boxes
on
five
out
of
their
six
sides
lightly
and
smoothly
keeping
to
the
grain
of
the
wood
and
not
going
over
the
same
surface
twice
if
you
can
help
it
this
is
why
a
flat
brush
is
the
best
it
will
go
right
down
the
side
of
a
brick
and
colour
it
at
one
sweep
then
stand
each
brick
up
on
end
to
dry
when
it
is
dry
you
can
paint
the
under
bit
on
which
it
has
been
standing
while
you
have
stains
and
colours
going
it
is
well
to
colour
some
of
your
arches
and
also
such
things
as
and
the
little
wooden
that
you
get
at
the
chemist
before
colouring
these
boxes
fill
them
with
sand
or
stones
and
stick
the
lids
on
with
glue
otherwise
they
will
not
be
heavy
enough
to
build
with
happily
this
painting
or
colouring
should
be
done
out
of
doors
or
in
an
if
possible
if
you
have
to
do
it
in
the
house
spread
several
thicknesses
of
newspaper
before
you
begin
and
make
a
calm
resting
place
for
your
painted
things
where
they
can
dry
at
leisure
and
not
be
scarred
with
the
of
her
who
clears
away
the
earnest
builder
will
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
any
carpentering
that
may
go
on
in
the
house
and
annex
the
smaller
blocks
of
wood
cut
off
the
end
of
things
which
to
an
alien
eye
are
so
much
rubbish
but
which
are
to
the
builder
stores
of
price
if
there
are
a
few
shillings
to
spare
the
carpenter
will
for
those
few
shillings
cut
you
certain
shapes
which
you
can
not
buy
in
shops
arches
of
a
comfortable
thickness
and
of
satisfying
curves
and
slabs
of
board
for
building
steps
these
should
be
of
varying
lengths
and
thicknesses
and
made
in
sets
of
twelve
steps
with
two
boards
to
each
step
slabs
to
a
set
the
biggest
might
be
in
thick
and
the
bottom
and
largest
slabs
by
lessening
to
by
in
the
next
set
might
be
and
of
corresponding
proportions
then
then
in
the
two
basic
slabs
of
the
in
would
be
by
and
those
of
the
in
would
be
by
in
a
set
with
in
steps
the
basic
slabs
by
in
would
complete
the
set
flights
of
steps
of
many
varying
heights
and
sizes
could
be
built
with
these
slabs
ask
the
carpenter
if
the
shillings
are
forthcoming
to
save
for
you
the
curved
pieces
of
wood
which
come
out
of
the
arches
they
are
very
useful
for
the
bases
of
pillars
for
towers
and
for
the
pedestals
of
statues
or
vases
some
of
the
arches
steps
and
blocks
should
be
coloured
to
match
the
red
white
and
brown
bricks
illustration
arches
and
pillars
some
of
the
boxes
particularly
the
larger
ones
should
have
doorways
sawn
in
them
on
opposite
sides
it
is
pleasant
to
look
a
building
and
see
the
light
beyond
and
if
you
are
a
thorough
builder
you
can
make
a
pillared
interior
which
will
delight
the
eyes
of
those
who
stoop
down
and
peer
through
the
doorway
a
few
narrow
oblong
windows
high
up
will
also
be
useful
you
need
not
show
them
unless
you
wish
you
can
always
conceal
them
by
a
façade

pillared
court
another
pleasant
use
of
a
big
box
is
to
cut
out
the
top
and
sides
and
make
a
columned
court
of
it
which
when
dignifies
your
city
with
almost
all
the
glory
that
was
greece
and
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
the
columns
are
cut
from
twopence
each
at
the
or
in
the
case
of
smaller
boxes
from
those
nice
round
smooth
wooden
sticks
which
cost
a
penny
and
are
used
in
ordinary
life
to
thread
on
if
you
are
going
to
make
a
city
which
is
to
stand
for
some
time
a
little
thin
glue
is
a
good
help
to
stability
if
it
is
only
a
city
plasticine
is
good
the
least
touch
of
it
seeming
to
make
things
safe
which
otherwise
might
totter
to
their
ruin
but
except
as
mortar
plasticine
should
be
shunned
it
is
not
good
as
a
building
material
having
now
your
bricks
boxes
arches
steps
and
rounds
you
may
begin
to
block
out
your
building
quite
soon
you
will
begin
to
find
that
everything
is
too
rectilinear
even
the
arches
and
the
rounds
and
the
pillars
and
the
can
not
satisfy
your
desire
for
curves
this
is
the
moment
when
you
will
begin
to
look
about
you
for
domes
and
the
domes
on
the
instant
of
their
imposition
in
your
building
will
call
out
for
minarets
it
is
then
that
you
will
wander
about
the
house
seeking
eagerly
for
things
that
are
like
other
things
your
search
will
be
magnificently
successful
if
only
the
lady
of
the
house
has
given
you
a
free
hand
and
you
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
the
sympathies
of
the
kitchen

chapter
iv
the
magic
city
the
only
magic
in
the
city
is
the
magic
of
imagination
which
is
after
all
the
best
magic
in
the
world
the
idea
of
it
came
to
me
when
i
was
dissatisfied
with
the
materials
provided
for
children
to
build
with
and
i
think
it
must
be
a
really
true
idea
because
wherever
i
have
applied
it
it
has
worked
and
that
i
am
told
is
in
accordance
with
the
philosophy
of
pragmatism
and
a
characteristic
of
all
great
discoveries
you
may
build
magic
cities
in
homes
of
modest
comfort
using
all
the
pretty
things
you
can
lay
your
hands
on
you
may
build
them
in
the
mansions
of
the
rich
if
the
rich
are
nice
people
and
love
cities
and
if
the
butler
will
let
you
have
the
silver
candlesticks
for
pillars
and
the
for
domes
and
you
could
build
one
in
the
houses
of
the
very
poor
if
the
very
poor
had
any
space
for
building
build
them
there
and
not
use
a
single
thing
that
could
not
be
begged
or
borrowed
by
an
intelligent
child
no
matter
how
poor
children
love
to
build
i
still
think
with
fond
affection
and
i
am
afraid
speak
with
tiresome
repetition
of
those
big
oak
bricks
which
we
had
when
we
were
children
they
disappeared
when
we
left
the
old
london
house
where
i
was
born
it
was
in
kennington
that
house
and
it
had
a
big
garden
and
a
meadow
and
a
cottage
and
a
laundry
stables
and
and
and
vines
tiger
lilies
and
flags
in
the
garden
and
chrysanthemums
that
smelt
like
earth
and
hyacinths
that
smelt
like
heaven
our
nursery
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
a
big
room
with
a
pillar
in
the
middle
to
support
the
roof
the
post
we
called
it
it
was
excellent
for
playing
mulberry
bush
or
for
being
martyrs
at
the
skipping
rope
did
to
bind
the
martyrs
to
the
stake
when
we
left
that
house
we
went
to
brighton
where
there
was
a
small
and
gritty
garden
where
nothing
grew
but
geraniums
and
calceolarias
and
we
did
not
have
our
bricks
any
more
perhaps
they
were
too
heavy
to
move
perhaps
the
brighton
house
was
too
small
for
the
chest
i
think
i
must
have
clamoured
for
the
old
bricks
for
i
remember
very
well
the
advent
of
a
small
box
of
deal
bricks
made
in
germany
which
had
indeed
two
arches
and
four
pillars
and
a
square
of
glass
framed
in
wood
daubed
with
heavy
ugly
body
colour
and
called
a
window
but
you
could
not
build
with
those
bricks
so
there
was
no
building
at
brighton
except
on
the
beach
sand
is
as
good
as
anything
in
the
world
to
build
with
but
there
is
no
sand
on
the
beach
at
brighton
only
sandiness
there
are
stones
pebbles
you
call
them
but
they
are
too
round
to
be
piled
up
into
buildings
the
only
thing
you
can
play
with
them
is
dolls
dinner
parties
there
are
plenty
of
oyster
shells
and
flat
bits
of
slate
and
tile
for
dishes
and
plates
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
find
stones
the
proper
shape
and
colour
for
boiled
fowls
and
hams
and
roast
legs
of
mutton
german
sausages
ribs
of
beef
mince
pies
pork
pies
roast
hare
or
calf
head
but
building
is
impossible
in
the
courtyard
of
our
house
in
france
there
was
an
with
a
sloping
roof
and
a
flat
parapet
about
four
feet
high
we
used
to
build
little
clay
huts
along
this
and
roof
them
with
slates
leaving
a
hole
for
a
chimney
the
huts
had
holes
for
windows
and
doors
and
we
used
to
collect
bits
of
candle
and
put
them
in
our
huts
after
dark
and
enjoy
the
lovely
spectacle
of
our
illuminated
buildings
till
some
one
remembered
us
and
caught
us
and
sent
us
to
bed
that
was
the
curse
of
our
the
very
splendour
of
the
result
attracted
the
attention
one
most
wished
to
avoid
but
clay
was
our
only
building
material
and
after
the
big
bricks
were
lost
i
never
had
any
more
bricks
till
i
had
children
of
my
own
who
had
bricks
of
their
own
and
then
i
played
with
them
and
theirs
and
even
then
i
never
thought
of
building
magic
cities
till
the
indian
soldiers
came
they
were
very
fine
soldiers
with
turbans
and
swords
and
eyes
that
gleamed
in
quite
a
lifelike
way
riding
on
horses
of
a
violently
active
appearance
they
came
to
my
little
son
when
he
was
getting
well
after
measles
or
some
such
sorrow
and
he
wanted
a
fort
built
for
them
so
we
rattled
all
the
bricks
out
of
their
boxes
on
to
the
long
table
in
the
and
began
to
build
but
do
what
we
would
our
fort
would
not
look
like
a
fort
at
any
rate
not
like
an
eastern
fort
we
pulled
it
down
and
tried
again
and
then
again
but
no
regardless
of
our
patient
energy
our
fort
quietly
but
persistently
refused
to
look
like
anything
but
a
factory
a
building
wholly
unworthy
of
those
military
heroes
with
the
prancing
steeds
and
the
coloured
turbans
and
the
eyes
with
so
much
white
in
them
so
then
i
wondered
what
was
needed
to
give
a
hint
of
the
gorgeous
east
to
the
fort
and
i
perceived
that
what
was
wanted
was
a
dome
domes
so
i
fetched
some
brass
and
lustre
basins
off
the
dresser
in
the
and
inverted
one
on
the
chief
tower
of
our
fort
and
behold
the
east
began
to
sparkle
and
beckon
domes
called
for
minarets
and
chessmen
on
pillars
supplied
the
need
one
thing
led
to
another
and
before
the
day
was
over
the
indian
horsemen
were
in
full
charge
across
a
sanded
plain
where
palm
trees
grew
a
sanded
plain
bounded
only
by
the
edges
of
the
table
along
three
sides
of
which
were
buildings
that
never
rose
beside
the
banks
of
thames
but
seemed
quite
suitable
piles
to
reflect
their
fair
proportions
in
the
ganges
or
the
sutlej
especially
when
viewed
by
eyes
which
had
not
had
the
privilege
of
gazing
on
those
fair
and
distant
streams
i
learned
a
great
deal
in
that
my
first
day
of
what
i
may
term
romantic
building
but
what
i
learned
was
the
merest
of
the
possibilities
of
my
discovery
my
little
son
for
his
part
learned
that
a
bowl
one
way
up
is
a
bowl
a
thing
for
a
little
boy
to
eat
bread
and
milk
out
of
the
other
way
up
it
is
a
dome
for
a
king
palace
that
books
are
not
only
things
to
read
but
that
they
will
make
marble
slabs
for
the
building
of
temples
that
chessmen
are
not
only
useful
for
playing
that
difficult
and
tedious
game
on
which
are
so
slowly
and
silently
intent
or
even
for
playing
all
those
other
games
of
soldiers
which
will
naturally
occur
to
any
one
with
command
of
the
pleasant
turned
pieces
chessmen
he
learned
had
other
and
less
simple
uses
as
minarets
of
delicate
carved
work
they
lightened
the
mass
of
buildings
and
conferred
elegance
and
distinction
converting
what
had
been
a
block
of
bricks
into
a
pavilion
for
a
sultan
or
a
tomb
for
a
sultan

was
a
little
i
remember
at
the
corner
of
our
first
city
and
there
has
been
a
little
at
the
corner
of
every
city
we
have
built
since
in
simple
beauty
that
little
seemed
to
us
then
to
touch
perfection
and
really
you
know
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
improve
on
it
the
material
was
simplicity
itself
six
books
five
chessmen
and
a
basin
and
you
see
here
how
the
looked
when
it
was
done
illustration
the
illustration
the
domino
door
there
was
a
black
box
i
remember
standing
on
another
box
with
domino
steps
it
needed
a
door
and
we
made
it
a
door
of
ivory
with
the
double
blank
of
the
dominoes
and
a
portico
of
three
cigarettes
two
for
pillars
and
one
to
lie
on
the
top
of
the
pillars
and
complete
the
portico
you
have
no
idea
how
fine
the
whole
thing
looked
like
a
strong
little
house
of
ebony
and
ivory
a
little
sombre
in
appearance
perhaps
and
like
a
house
that
has
a
secret
to
keep
but
quite
fine
the
palm
trees
we
made
out
of
pieces
of
larch
and
yew
fastened
by
plasticine
to
the
tops
of
elder
twigs
and
elder
twigs
have
a
graceful
carriage
not
too
upright
and
yet
not
drooping
they
look
very
like
the
trunks
of
tropical
trees
but
if
you
have
not
elders
and
larches
and
yew
trees
to
command
you
can
make
trees
for
your
city
in
other
ways
for
little
trees
in
tubs
we
had
southernwood
stuck
in
cotton
reels
these
make
enchanting
tubs
and
there
are
a
good
many
different
shapes
so
that
your

are
pleasantly
varied

we
found
useful

the
magic
city
on
the
first
day
of
building
what
we
soon
came
to
call
magic
cities
we
trusted
to
inspiration
there
was
no
time
for
thought
and
this
day
was
perhaps
the
most
interesting
day
of
all
for
we
had
everything
to
learn
one
of
the
things
which
i
learned
was
that
this
magic
city
game
was
an
excellent
training
for
eye
and
hand
as
well
as
for
the
imagination
and
the
more
soothing
of
the
domestic
virtues
the
eye
is
trained
to
perceive
likenesses
and
differences
in
the
shapes
and
colours
of
things
to
notice
as
i
said
that
a
bowl
is
a
dome
wrong
way
up
and
that
cigarettes
are
like
white
pillars
a
beautiful
yet
sinister
temple
might
be
built
with
cigars
for
pillars
and
for
pediments
if
cigars
were
the
sort
of
things
you
were
ever
allowed
to
play
with
you
see
that
yew
and
larch
and
elder
can
be
made
to
look
like
palm
trees
and
that
shrubs
in
tubs
are
really
like
sprigs
of
southernwood
in
cotton
reels
you
go
about
with
eyes
newly
opened
to
form
and
colour
you
look
at
every
object
in
a
new
light
trying
to
see
whether
it
is
or
is
not
like
something
else
something
that
can
be
used
in
your
magic
city
you
notice
that
a
door
is
much
the
same
shape
as
and
your
architectural
instinct
already
beginning
to
develop
assures
you
that
a
pearly
door
would
be
a
beautiful
thing
for
a
temple
if
only
auntie
sees
things
in
the
same
light
as
you
do
you
perceive
that
a
cribbage
board
is
straight
and
narrow
as
a
path
leading
to
such
a
door
might
be
and
that
if
you
stick
tiny
tufts
of
southernwood
or
veronica
into
the
holes
along
the
ivory
sides
of
your
path
your
path
will
run
between
two
little
green
hedges
you
will
notice
that
books
make
colonnades
darkly
mysterious
if
the
lids
of
the
brick
boxes
are
laid
along
the
back
and
along
the
top
and
that
based
on
these
solidly
built
colonnades
your
bricks
and
arches
will
rise
in
galleries
of
unexpected
dignity
and
charm
the
building
itself
the
placing
of
bricks
and
dominoes
and
books
and
chessmen
and
bowls
with
exactness
and
neatness
is
in
itself
a
lesson
in
firm
and
delicate
handling
such
a
lesson
as
is
impossible
if
you
are
building
with
bricks
alone
the
call
on
the
imagination
is
strong
and
clear
a
house
the
meanest
hut
can
not
be
built
without
a
plan
or
without
an
architect
though
the
architect
may
be
only
a
little
child
and
the
plan
may
be
only
a
little
child
dream
to
build
without
a
plan
is
to
heap
bricks
one
on
another
to
make
a
cairn
not
a
house
the
plan
for
the
magic
city
then
gets
itself
dreamed
the
child
imagination
learns
to
know
what
the
bowl
will
look
like
when
it
is
upside
down
and
presently
what
sort
of
bowls
and
books
and
bricks
are
needed
to
give
to
the
palace
of
its
desire
some
shadow
in
solid
fact
perceptible
to
the
senses
to
create
in
the
image
of
his
dream
is
the
hope
and
the
despair
of
every
artist
and
even
though
the
image
be
distorted
as
in
all
works
of
art
even
the
greatest
it
always
must
be
yet
it
is
joy
even
to
have
created
the
poorest
image
of
a
dream
and
in
the
labour
of
creation
will
blossom
those
domestic
virtues
which
best
adorn
the
home
patience
for
it
is
not
often
that
for
the
young
architect
dream
and
image
even
vaguely
coincide
at
the
first
effort
or
the
second
or
the
third
good
temper
for
no
one
can
build
anything
in
a
rage
the
spirit
of
anger
is
the
enemy
of
the
spirit
of
architecture
and
besides
being
angry
may
make
your
hand
shake
and
then
nothing
is
any
good
perseverance
too
without
which
patience
is
a
mere
passive
endurance
all
these
grow
strong
while
you
build
your
cities
and
try
to
make
visible
your
dream
i
do
not
mean
that
a
child
building
a
city
sees
all
of
it
at
once
in
every
detail
i
do
suppose
even
the
heaviest
of
architects
does
that
but
i
mean
that
he
sees
the
masses
of
it
with
the
eye
of
the
mind
and
arrives
by
experiment
at
the
details
that
best
suit
those
masses
if
the
glass
will
not
do
the
without
a
handle
will
or
perhaps
the
saucer
or
the
lid
of
a
one
must
look
about
and
find
something
that
do
something
which
when
it
is
put
in
its
place
will
seem
the
only
possible
thing
i
do
know
how
real
architects
work
but
this
is
how
you
work
with
magic
cities
chapter
v
materials
you
wander
round
the
house
seeking
beautiful
things
which
look
like
other
beautiful
things
let
us
suppose
that
you
have
the
run
of
a
house
where
beautiful
things
are
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
what
to
do
in
the
house
where
beautiful
or
at
any
rate
costly
things
are
not
it
is
best
when
the
owner
of
the
house
is
an
enthusiastic
member
of
the
building
party
then
she
will
grudge
nothing
in
the
you
will
find
silver
candlesticks
and
a
silver
inkstand
the
candlesticks
are
like
pillars
put
the
inkstand
across
the
pillars
and
you
have
a
gateway
of
unexampled
splendour
if
there
be
a
take
it
it
will
make
the
great
door
of
your
greatest
temple
silver
bowls
should
not
be
passed
by
nor
bronzes
a
vase
of
japanese
bronze
set
up
between
two
ebony
elephants
crowns
a
flat
pillared
building
with
splendour
there
may
be
chinese
dragons
or
egyptian
gods
that
have
lain
a
thousand
years
safe
in
their
bronze
amid
the
sands
of
the
desert
cast
aside
by
the
foot
of
the
camel
unseen
in
the
shadow
of
the
tent
and
now
decking
the
mantelpiece
of
the
room
you
are
looting
little
silver
figures
of
knights
in
armour
and
what
not
take
them
if
you
get
the
chance
chessmen
too
as
many
as
you
can
get
the
carved
ivory
ones
of
red
and
white
and
the
black
and
brown
kind
where
the
heads
of
the
kings
and
queens
are
so
like
marbles
and
those
of
the
pawns
like
draughts
too
and
spillikins
and
those
little
metal
animals
heavy
and
coloured
which
you
see
on
glass
shelves
in
the
fancy
shop
take
them
too
they
will
serve
other
uses
than
those
to
which
you
will
dedicate
your
noah
ark
animals
card
counters
especially
the
golden
and
kinds
and
dominoes
and
the
pots
and
a
blue
cup
or
so
from
the
cupboard
take
all
these
always
giving
preference
to
the
things
that
you
will
not
be
asked
to
put
back
the
same
day
little
japanese
cabinets
of
tortoiseshell
or
wood
or
silver
silver
boxes
and
boxes
of
all
beautiful
kinds
do
not
take
the
playing
cards
that
people
play
bridge
with
these
are
never
quite
the
same
after
they
have
been
used
in
magic
cities
and
the
queen
of
hearts
always
gets
lost
you
can
usually
acquire
odd
packs
of
cards
that
nobody
wants
those
with
black
and
gold
backs
are
the
best
they
make
gorgeous
pagodas
and
a
touch
of
plasticine
keeps
each
card
where
it
should
be
in
the
you
may
acquire
perhaps
at
least
you
can
in
mine
brass
and
the
lids
of
urns
and
kettles
from
the
dresser
and
mugs
and
basins
of
lustre
and
of
blue
also
those
very
little
pewter
from
liberty
and
the
tumblers
for
your
towers
of
light
if
you
are
going
to
have
any
the
library
will
yield
you
books
and
atlases
very
useful
for
roofs
these
last
if
they
do
not
slope
too
much
from
back
to
edge
if
they
do
you
can
get
even
with
them
by
wedges
of
paper
laid
in
on
the
thin
side
but
the
kitchen
will
be
your
happiest
and
here
you
will
make
a
good
bag
even
in
those
houses
where
you
are
not
allowed
any
of
the
treasures
from
the

the

and

may
glean
in
a

most
beautiful

a

happened

the

the
snowy

linen
sheets
over
the

the

of
the

faced
with
bricks
and
bearing
a
large
blue
jar
crowned
with
a

some
blue

white
tiles
an
egyptian
god
stands
at
the
corner
of
the
upper
and
the
lower
building
and
two
green
trees
with
white
roses
grow
out
of
a
tomb
at
the
left
the
pathway
is
of
tiles
edged
with
fir
cones
and
two
within
tubs
cotton
reels
stand
at
its
beginning
the
whole
thing
was
blue
and
silver
and
black
and
i
wish
i
could
show
you
a
coloured
picture
of
it
or
better
still
build
the
thing
up
for
you
to
see
the
lower
platform
on
the
right
is
a
box
faced
with
silver
of
honesty
and
the
arches
and
court
are
red
the
steps
are
made
of
blocks
of
sugar
the
tank
is
edged
with
red
bricks
and
the
water
where
the
seal
swims
is
silver
paper
in
front
is
a
pavement
made
of
card
counters
and
the
inside
of
the
court
is
made
of
one
large
red
tile
with
a
pattern
of
white
on
it
you
can
do
this
with
a
square
board
painted
red
and
counters
laid
on
it
the
fountain
in
the
middle
is
a
brass
and
the
waters
that
rise
from
it
are
silver
paper
but
in
the
picture
the
water
of
the
fountain
seems
to
have
been
blown
aside
by
the
wind
which
no
doubt
is
severe
in
those
desolate
regions
of
snow
you
can
build
just
such
another
tower
and
castle
with
the
things
you
have
but
when
once
you
start
building
you
will
most
likely
think
of
some
other
way
quite
different
from
mine
and
just
as
good
tiles
by
the
way
are
most
useful
and
if
you
have
an
uncle
who
is
an
architect
he
will
have
any
number
sent
to
him
as
samples
and
he
will
be
rather
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
if
your
uncles
are
all
eminent
in
other
walks
of
life
it
is
a
pity
but
you
are
probably
friends
with
the
man
who
papers
and
paints
your
house
or
the
man
who
comes
when
the
pipes
burst
at
christmas
or
the
man
who
comes
about
the
gas
or
the
man
who
knows
all
the
sullen
secrets
of
the
kitchen
range
it
will
be
strange
if
none
of
these
can
get
you
a
few
coloured
tiles
when
once
they
know
you
want
them
it
is
well
if
you
are
a
child
with
a
taste
for
building
to
take
pains
to
become
acquainted
with
all
the
men
who
come
to
your
house
to
do
interesting
things
with
tools
and
wood
and
iron
and
lead
quite
apart
from
the
joy
of
watching
their
slow
and
mysterious
processes
and
thinking
how
easy
it
would
be
to
be
a
plumber
or
a
paperhanger
yourself
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
left
over
from
their
work
which
are
of
no
use
to
them
but
may
be
of
much
use
to
you
all
sorts
of
screws
and
nails
for
instance
these
generous
men
will
now
and
then
bestow
little
screws
of
dry
colour
little
pieces
of
brass
and
thick
red
earthenware
pipe
good
for
towers
lengths
of
pleasantly
coloured
the
wrong
side
of
which
being
plain
can
be
used
for
all
sorts
of
purposes
lead
piping
is
useful
too
especially
if
you
get
it
cut
into
lengths
and
cut
the
sections
make
excellent
and
stable
for
cities
bits
of
brass
tubing
are
useful
too
in
fact
brass
objects
of
all
sorts
deserve
your
careful
consideration
because
if
a
city
is
to
look
handsome
it
must
have
a
good
deal
of
metal
about
it
as
the
cities
in
atlantis
did
as
i
write
i
see
more
and
more
clearly
that
a
sharp
distinction
must
be
drawn
between
cities
built
and
demolished
in
an
afternoon
and
cities
that
can
be
kept
going
and
added
to
day
by
day
for
weeks
you
may
often
be
fortunate
enough
to
raid
and
and
to
use
the
spoils
for
a
building
that
only
lasts
a
day
but
no
one
will
strip
her
rooms
of
all
the
pretty
things
you
want
and
let
you
keep
them
for
weeks
therefore
if
you
are
going
to
build
a
city
that
is
to
go
on
you
must
collect
the
materials
of
your
own
and
the
odds
and
ends
that
amiable
workmen
will
readily
give
you
will
take
a
useful
place
in
your
collection
if
you
let
it
be
known
that
you
want
odds
and
ends
of
pretty
and
simple
shapes
your
friends
will
save
them
for
you
and
you
will
gradually
amass
the
things
you
need
i
know
well
enough
that
there
will
have
to
be
a
place
to
keep
them
but
the
if
you
clear
out
all
the
toys
you
never
play
with
will
hold
a
good
deal
and
many
of
the
things
you
collect
will
do
for
other
purposes
as
well
as
for
the
building
of
cities

trees
first
in
your
building
collection
will
be
the
boxes

and

of
which
i
have
spoken
dominoes
and
draughts
and
chessmen
you
probably
have
odd
chessmen
quite
beautiful
ones
can
often
be
bought
for
a
few
pence
are
very
valuable
for
our
purpose
the
black
and
red
halma
men
are
very
useful
too
but
the
yellow
and
green
always
look
cheap
and
nasty
card
counters
are
useful
and
so
is
silver
paper
glass
drops
off
old
chandeliers
are
good
for
fountains
and
pieces
of
green
cloth
for
grass
plots
the
back
of
green
does
for
this
too
and
very
realistic
grass
lawns
can
be
made
by
chopping
up
the
long
green
grass
that
people
sell
for
fire
screens
it
is
really
sedge
finely
split
up
and
dyed
you
cut
it
up
as
finely
as
you
can
with
scissors
and
when
you
have
about
a
teacupful
you
take
a
square
of
stiff
cardboard
and
cover
it
all
over
with
glue
then
quickly
before
the
glue
has
time
to
cool
you
sprinkle
your
chopped
grass
thickly
all
over
it
and
leave
it
to
dry
next
day
spread
a
newspaper
and
turn
the
cardboard
over
so
that
the
loose
grass
falls
away
on
to
the
paper
fasten
down
your
grass
plot
in
a
suitable
place
in
your
city
and
build
a
little
red
brick
wall
round
it
with
a
little
arched
gateway
and
you
will
have
a
neat
and
charming
enclosed
garden
for
garden
beds
tobacco
makes
good
mould
and
shows
up
your

can
make
standard
of
loofah
dyed

and
the
stalks
of
long
matches
painted
brown
the
roses
which
are
stuck
on
with
glue
are
red
or
white
immortelles
and
the
whole
effect
is
just
what
you
are
trying
for
large
trees
can
be
made
of
sprigs
of
box
or
veronica
with
immortelles
glued
on
and
they
will
last
fresh

pretty

a

shells
are
extremely
useful
for
decoration
and
produce
the
effect
of
carving
almost
all
shells
will
be
useful
in
one
way
or
another
but
i
have
found
the
most
satisfaction
in
the
gray
and
pearly
shells
which
you
find
among
the
thick
seaweed
ridges
on
the
beach
below
the
grey
cliffs
of
cornwall
and
the
little
yellow
periwinkly
shells
that
lie
on
the
rocks
below
the
white
cliffs
of
kent
if
you
glue
these
shells
strongly
on
arches
and
pillars
you
will
find
them
very
handsome
adornments
illustration
thick

keep
your
shells
in
boxes
there
are
always
plenty
of
boxes
in
the
world
and
if
not
boxes
little
bags
will
do
to
hold
the
different
kinds
of
shells
it
is
well
worth
while
to
keep
the
different
kinds
separate
the
work
of
sorting
out
the
shells
is
very
damping
to
the
eager
enthusiast
anxious
to
execute
a
decorative
design
indeed
it
is
well
to
keep
all
your
building
materials
sorted
each
according
to
its
kind
the
wooden
things
together
and
the
metal
things
and
above
all
the
crockery
things
keep
the
noah
ark
animals
in
their
ark
and
the
bricks
in
their
boxes
and
when
you
are
going
to
build
do
get
everything
out
at
once
and
make
a
rubbish

as
you
grow
more
accustomed
to
building
you
will
find
that
sometimes
you
build
a
temple
or
palace
that
charms
you
so
much
that
you
wish
to
build
it
again
and
you
will
soon
learn
what
are
the
materials
needed
and
just
take
out
those
and
a
few
more
from
your
store
i
say
a
few
more
because
you
will
never
build
your
temple
or
your

twice
the
same
you
are
sure
to
think
of
some
improvement
however
small
i
have
made
beautiful
windows
with
the
sticks
of
an
old
ivory
fan
framed
in
dark
wood
bricks
and
ornamented
the
dark
wall
above
with
elephant
tusk
shells
and
others
and
below
with
carved
ivory
card
counters
illustration
the
elephant
temple
there
is
a
certain
elephant
temple
which
i
have
built
many
times
its
floor
is
a
red
and
white
chessboard
and
its
roof
is
supported
on
a
double
row
of
white
pillars
white
pillars
surround
the
altar
a
wooden
box
on
which
the
ebony
elephant
stands
on
each
side
of
him
are
red
fairy
lights
hidden
by
buttresses
from
the
human
eye
which
peeps
through
the
brazen
gates
into
that
shadowy
interior
and
falling
full
on
the
elephant
on
his
pillared
shrine
the
walls
are
of
big
red
books
and
boswell
of
the
roof
is
a
flat
square
lid
once
the
lid
of
a
packing
case
stained
a
dark
brown
like
the
bricks
on
the
side
are
the
windows
made
of
the
ivory
fan
and
the
dark
bricks
and
the
elephant
tusk
shells
there
is
a
door
too
a
one
in
a
former
life
it
was
the
of
a
aunt
who
nobly
contributed
it
to
the
temple
above
this
door
is
a
white
animal
from
the
noah
ark
and
all
the
rest
of
that
wall
is
built
up
of
brown
wooden
bricks
the
other
side
shows
between
dark
buttresses
the
red
of
the
books
and
towards
the
back
of
this
side
are
small
square
buildings
wooden
boxes
stained
brown
with
brass
domes
and
mysterious
doorways
i
think
the
priests
and
attendants
of
the
temple
live
here
the
front
of
the
temple
shows
a
little
of
the
red
between
dark
buttresses
which
here
are
ornamented
with
delicate
dark
carved
chessmen
the
gate
is
of
pierced
brass
two
for
a
door
and
the
brazen
pillars
of
the
portico
are
two
candlesticks
which
support
a
brass
inkstand
on
which
stand
two
yellowish
wooden
chessmen
on
the
middle
of
the
roof
is
a
big
lacquered
wooden
bowl
the
kind
that
nice
grocers
put
in
their
windows
full
of
prunes
or
coffee
above
is
a
brass
on
that
a
of
inlaid
brass
crowned
with
a
black
chess
king
there
are
two
dark
arches
with
on
them
and
round
the
roof
are
various
towers
and
turrets
and
tall
minarets
made
of
dark
bricks
with
chessmen
on
the
top
in
front
of
the
pillars
at
the
gate
two
black
elephants
stand
on
wooden
plinths
and
the
of
the
temple
and
the
space
at
the
side
are
paved
with
i
know
the
main
things
that
are
needed
for
this
temple
but
its
details
are
changed
a
little
every
time
i
build
it
if
you
can
not
get
card
counters
you
can
make
a
beautiful
pavement
by
pasting
the
shining
pods
of
honesty
in
a
pattern
on
a
piece
of
dark
brown
cardboard
or
dark
brown
paper
pasted
on
cardboard
but
if
you
do
this
you
must
build
a
little
brick
wall
all
round
to
hide
the
brown
paper
edges
build
gatehouses
in
your
wall
little
ones
to
show
off
by
contrast
the
massive
splendour
of
your
temple
these
honesty
pods
are
a
most
useful
substitute
for
you
can
paste
them
on
square
pillars
or
on
the
fronts
of
boxes
houses
i
mean
or
make
sloping
roofs
of
them
by
sticking
them
on
folded
cardboard
fastened
at
the
proper
angle
by
tapes
glued
about
a
third
of
the
way
up
but
as
a
rule
sloping
roofs
are
not
good
in
eastern
cities
a
grass
garden
with
paths
of
honesty
or
a
fountain
basin
in
the
middle
will
add
a
charm
to
any
city
square
and
by
the
way
do
be
afraid
of
open
spaces
have
as
many
buildings
as
you
like
and
mass
them
together
as
you
choose
but
let
there
be
open
spaces
they
will
be
to
your
building
as
mounts
are
to
pictures
or
margins
to
books
and
for
frame
or
binding
let
there
be
a
wall
all
round
your
city
it
gives
a
neatness
and
a
completeness
which
enhance
a
all
the
qualities
your
city
may
possess
illustration
honesty
roof
there
are
cardboard
models
of
paul
cathedral
the
tower
bridge
and
the
temple
at
jerusalem
these
are
interesting
in
themselves
and
it
is
good
to
put
them
together
the
temple
which
is
sold
by
the
religious
tract
society
is
really
beautiful
and
when
you
have
set
it
up
it
looks
like
a
model
in
ivory
the
bridge
and
the
cathedral
are
of
dull
brown
pasteboard
but
they
are
interesting
for
all
that
but
when
you
are
tired
of
these
things
as
models
parts
of
them
can
be
used
with
great
effect
in
your
building
especially
if
you
paint
the
brown
ones
with
aluminium
paint
or
even
whitewash
them
in
the
foreground
of
the
picture
of
the
astrologer
tower
you
will
see
a
little
house
which
does
look
as
if
it
belonged
where
it
is
and
no
more
it
does
it
was
put
in
just
to
show
you
what
these
little
cardboard
buildings
are
like
it
is
one
of
the
of
the
tower
bridge
and
the
little
white
house
on
the
parapet
above
the
steps
in
the
picture
of
the
silver
towers
is
a
little
out
of
another
model
when
you
are
collecting
shells
you
will
find
smooth
flat
stones
of
pleasing
colours
collect
them
the
thinner
the
better
you
can
make
mosaic
floors
of
them
fastening
them
in
their
place
with
glue
or
a
very
thin
layer
of
plasticine
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
are
useful
from
the
delicate
cones
of
the
larch
to
the
great
cones
that
fall
from
the
big
pine
trees
on
the
riviera
they
call
them
pineapples
there
and
they
use
them
for
lighting
fires
but
you
can
use
them
for
the
tops
of
towers
a
little
and
only
a
very
little
red
tinsel
paper
is
good
to
use
for
the
backs
of
shrines
it
gives
a
suggestion
of
the
glow
of
hidden
lamps
or
put
as
windows
near
the
tops
of
towers
it
suggests
the
glow
of
sunset
falling
on
jewelled
casements
you
can
get
it
and
also
bundles
of
stamped
strips
of
gold
paper
which
should
be
used
very
sparingly
indeed
from
bousquet
of
the
barbican
in
london
city
there
are
other
things
which
could
serve
for
part
of
your
collection
but
i
have
told
about
these
in
the
chapter
on
poor
children
cities
because
the
poorest
child
can
get
them
but
they
are
desirable
in
any
collection
such
things
as
and
the
different
kinds
of
common
things
that
you
can
use
for
decorating
the
fronts
and
backs
and
sides
of
houses
if
you
have
not
enough
bricks
to
build
façades
to
them
all
and
remember
always
to
make
the
backs
of
your
houses
as
beautiful
as
the
fronts
they
may
and
should
be
plainer
but
not
less
beautiful
do
not
be
like
the
who
spend
all
their
decoration
such
as
it
is
on
the
flat
fronts
of
their
villas
and
leave
the
sides
and
back
flat
and
ugly
and
so
that
when
you
see
the
row
of
them
from
the
railway
they
look
miserable
and
dejected
as
though
they
knew
how
ugly
they
were
and
were
sorry
chapter
vii
the
poor
child
city
when
my
city
was
built
at
olympia
a
great
many
who
came
to
see
it
told
me
that
they
would
like
to
help
the
children
in
their
schools
to
build
such
cities
but
that
it
would
not
be
possible
because
the
children
came
from
poor
homes
where
there
were
none
of
the
pretty
things
candlesticks
brass
bowls
silver
chessmen
draughts
books
and
all
the
rest
of
it
which
i
had
used
to
build
my
city
so
then
i
said
i
would
build
a
city
out
of
the
sort
of
things
that
poor
children
could
collect
and
bring
to
school
and
i
did
my
friends
annis
and
taylor
who
were
helping
me
to
explain
the
city
and
show
it
to
visitors
helped
me
with
the
building
we
did
it
in
a
day
and
it
was
very
pretty
so
pretty
that
the
who
came
to
see
it
asked
me
to
write
a
book
to
say
how
was
done
and
so
i
did
there
are
no
words
to
express
half
what
i
feel
about
the
teachers
in
our
council
schools
their
enthusiasm
their
patience
their
energy
their
devotion
when
we
think
of
what
the
lives
of
poor
children
are
of
the
little
they
have
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
the
little
chance
they
have
of
growing
up
to
any
better
fate
than
that
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
who
do
the
hardest
work
of
all
and
get
the
least
pay
of
all
those
who
work
for
money
when
we
think
how
rich
people
have
money
to
throw
away
how
their
dogs
have
velvet
coats
and
silver
collars
and
eat
chicken
off
china
while
the
little
children
of
the
poor
live
on
bread
and
tea
and
wear
what
they
can
get
often
enough
too
little
when
we
think
of
all
these
things
if
we
can
bear
to
think
of
them
at
all
there
is
not
one
of
us
i
suppose
who
would
not
willingly
die
if
by
our
death
we
could
secure
for
these
children
a
fairer
share
of
the
wealth
of
england
the
richest
country
in
the
world
for
wealth
by
which
i
mean
money
can
buy
all
those
things
which
children
ought
to
have
and
which
these
children
do
not
have
good
food
warm
clothes
fresh
country
air
playthings
and
books
and
pictures
remembering
that
by
far
the
greater
number
of
children
of
england
have
none
of
these
things
you
would
i
know
gladly
die
if
dying
would
help
to
die
for
a
cause
is
easy
you
leap
into
the
gulf
like
curtius
or
fall
on
the
spears
like
winkelried
or
go
down
with
your
ship
for
the
honour
of
your
country
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
to
try
to
save
one
child
from
fire
or
water
and
die
in
the
attempt
that
is
easy
and
glorious
the
hard
thing
to
do
is
to
live
for
your
country
to
live
for
its
children
and
it
is
this
that
the
teachers
in
the
council
schools
do
year
in
and
year
out
with
the
most
unselfish
nobility
and
perseverance
and
nobody
applauds
or
makes
as
much
fuss
as
is
made
over
a
boy
who
saves
a
drowning
kitten
in
the
face
of
enormous
difficulties
and
obstacles
exposed
to
the
constant
of
little
worries
kept
short
of
space
short
of
materials
and
short
of
money
yet
these
teachers
go
on
bravely
not
just
doing
what
they
are
paid
to
do
but
a
thousand
times
more
devoting
heart
mind
and
soul
to
their
splendid
ambition
and
counting
themselves
well
paid
if
they
can
make
the
world
a
better
and
a
brighter
place
for
the
children
they
serve
if
these
children
when
they
grow
up
shall
prove
better
citizens
kinder
fathers
and
better
wiser
and
nobler
than
their
fathers
were
we
shall
owe
all
the
change
and
progress
to
the
teachers
who
are
spending
their
lives
to
this
end
and
this
i
had
to
say
before
i
could
begin
to
write
about
how
cities
may
be
built
of
such
materials
as
poor
children
can
collect
and
bring
to
school
for
i
have
to
own
that
poor
children
live
in
such
little
crowded
houses
that
there
is
no
room
for
the
building
of
cities
and
in
the
courts
and
streets
where
they
play
they
can
not
build
for
the
would
tumble
over
their
cities
and
the
policemen
would
call
it
an
obstruction
so
if
they
have
a
city
at
all
it
must
be
where
they
have
most
of
their
pleasant
plays
at
school
besides
the
children
i
have
in
mind
are
so
very
poor
that
no
one
child
could
possibly
collect
enough
materials
for
a
city
but
a
number
of
children
could
each
of
them
bring
a
few
things
and
thus
make
up
enough
for
the
building
and
in
most
schools
there
will
be
some
children
not
quite
so
poor
who
can
afford
a
penny
or
so
for
tinsel
paper
and
the
few
things
colours
paints
and
so
on
that
do
not
occur
naturally
in
a
house
even
a
house
these
let
us
hope
will
be
able
to
furnish
a
few
old
chessmen
for
there
is
nothing
like
chessmen
for
giving
an
air
of
elegance
to
domes
and
minarets
if
you
can
not
get
chessmen
small
are
good
you
can
cut
them
in
halves
and
then
you
have
two
kinds
of
minaret
they
can
be
coloured
red
or
dark
brown
or
if
your
city
seems
likely
to
lack
metal
you
can
paint
them
with
gold
or
aluminium
paint
they
look
well
when
cut
shorter
as
the
battlements
of
buildings
rather
like
halma
men
but
of
handsomer
and
more
rotund
proportions
your
halma
man
as
you
buy
him
in
a
box
is
ever
a
bit
of
a
starveling
if
you
cut
your
peg
into
three
the
middle
section
will
make
short
round
pillars
to
support
little
galleries
the
roof
being
a
strip
of
or
the
lid
of
a
narrow
box
illustration
clothes
pegs
cardboard
and
wooden
boxes
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
are
always
easy
to
get
these
can
be
coloured
as
explained
in
another
chapter
and
little
doors
and
windows
cut
in
them
but
be
sparing
of
windows
too
many
windows
detract
from
the
dignity
of
your
tower
and
make
it
look
like
a
factory
in
poor
schools
there
will
not
be
many
bricks
and
something
must
be
done
to
add
variety
to
the
façades
of
buildings
when
there
are
not
enough
bricks
to
cover
or
decorate
your
boxes
a
good
deal
can
be
done
with
haricot
beans
tapioca
and
sago
fasten
the
beans
round
the
doorways
and
the
windows
with
glue
or
seccotine
or
plasticine
if
you
use
glue
let
the
be
quite
cold
before
you
do
anything
else
with
it
next
day
is
an
excellent
rule
when
the
beans
are
quite
firmly
fixed
glue
the
surface
all
over
and
sprinkle
with
tapioca
so
that
not
a
bit
of
the
box
shows
leave
the
tapioca
lying
on
the
surface
till
then
turn
it
up
the
loose
tapioca
will
fall
off
and
leave
a
pleasant
surface
round
cardboard
boxes
such
as
or
make
splendid
towers
treated
in
this
way
if
you
can
not
get
the
little
round
yellow
periwinkly
shells
maize
is
very
good
if
you
cut
each
grain
flat
with
a
sharp
knife
and
fix
the
grains
with
glue
as
pillars
and
arches
tin
boxes
or
round
tins
polished
to
silvery
brightness
with
doors
and
windows
and
crenellations
of
black
can
be
built
into
palaces
of
astonishing
splendour
as
you
can
see
in
the
picture
of
the
silver
towers
but
always
beware
of
too
many
windows
other
excellent
towers
are
you
can
paint
them
any
colour
you
like
but
i
advise
you
to
stick
to
cream
colour
and
dark
brown
very
pretty
towers
can
be
made
of
white
with
windows
and
doors
and
crenellation
of
gold
paper
only
you
should
outline
the
gold
with
ink
or
dark
stain
to
make
it
show
up
against
the
white
basins
that
are
cracked
make
good
domes
and
you
can
almost
always
get
a
cracked
basin
however
poor
you
are
that
have
lost
their
handles
or
had
a
piece
bitten
out
of
them
are
also
not
hard
to
get
and
the
lids
of
teapots
that
are
broken
and
of
saucepans
that
have
been
burnt
through
come
readily
enough
to
the
hand
of
the
collector
honey
pots
and
the
little
brown
jugs
that
cream
is
sold
in
are
easy
to
come
by
and
make
domes
for
buildings
when
once
you
begin
to
build
you
will
find
that
all
sorts
of
things
that
before
looked
neither
useful
nor
beautiful
become
both
when
they
are
built
into
your
city
look
at
the
in
the
elephant
temple
and
the
and
the
on
the
top
of
the
tower
of
pearl
and
red
illustration
towers
and
cocoanut
cottage
those
children
who
are
lucky
enough
to
go
into
the
country
for
a
holiday
can
collect
and
acorns
nicely
shaped
bits
of
wood
are
more
easily
come
by
in
a
country
village
than
in
a
london
slum
acorns
are
most
useful
both
the
acorn
and
the
cup
a
brown
building
with
doors
and
windows
outlined
in
acorn
cups
with
their
flat
side
set
on
with
glue
looks
like
a
precious
work
of
carved
wood
if
you
ca
get
acorn
cups
the
shells
of
barcelona
nuts
are
good
but
they
are
difficult
to
cut
into
the
needed
cup
shape
the
shells
of
on
a
building
look
like
carved
stones
but
always
the
nutshell
must
fit
its
edges
tightly
and
neatly
to
the
surface
and
show
as
a
little
round
neat
boss
your
own
observation
will
supply
you
with
other
little
and
valueless
things
which
will
become
valuable
as
soon
as
you
stick
them
evenly
and
closely
on
a
foundation
of
their
own
colour
the
periwinkly
shells
and
the
maize
grains
look
best
on
white
wood
the
shells
of
the
cocoanut
have
a
value
all
their
own
the
larger
ones
sawn
neatly
in
halves
make
impressive
domes
for
brown
buildings
and
half
a
small
cocoanut
shell
will
roof
a
cardboard
box
that
has
held
elastic
bands
and
you
can
call
it
a
thatched
cottage
or
the
hut
of
a
savage
chief
i
called
mine
cocoanut
cottage
and
the
curator
of
my
botanical
museum
lived
there
the
chief
astrologer
of
course
lived
at
the
top
of
his
tower
which
was
a
photographic
enlarging
apparatus
ponds
and
rivers
can
be
made
with
the
silver
paper
that
comes
off
cigarettes
and
i
have
made
a
very
impressive
tower
with
match
boxes
painted
black
and
piled
one
on
another
so
that
the
blue
side
shows
in
front
with
a
touch
of
red
at
each
side
black
windows
if
you
like
if
you
can
not
get
any
chessmen
the
pinnacles
of
your
buildings
must
be
acorns
and
with
a
very
occasional
piece
of
lead
pencil
or
short
piece
of
brass
tubing
with
an
acorn
or
a
on
the
top
too
look
quite
baronial
stuck
upright
on
the
posts
of
gates
and
they
are
good
edging
for
paths
and
roads
make
nice
little
turrets
and
cotton
reels
coloured
to
match
the
bricks
and
the
boxes
are
the
finest
flower
tubs
in
the
world
with
sprigs
of
evergreen
stuck
in
them
or
a
little
made
they
look
quite
and
convincing
especially
if
you
paste
a
circle
of
brown
paper
on
the
top
of
the
reel
to
look
like
mould
before
you
stick
your
shrub
in
the
hole
so
conveniently
placed
in
the
reel
apparently
on
purpose
to
have
shrubs
planted
in
it
cotton
reels
with
acorns
or
on
them
are
good
on
the
top
of
illustration
cotton
reels
illustration
lattice
window
these
are
just
a
few
of
the
things
that
poor
children
can
get
and
the
way
they
can
use
them
the
moment
you
begin
to
build
you
will
think
of
a
hundred
things
that
i
have
not
thought
of
and
a
hundred
ways
of
using
them
that
i
should
not
have
thought
of
trying
if
you
can
so
arrange
the
site
of
your
city
that
it
need
not
be
disturbed
it
will
grow
in
beauty
day
by
day
and
you
will
presently
have
to
name
a
day
to
satisfy
the
children
who
will
want
to
bring
their
parents
to
see
it
if
you
give
a
school
party
no
other
attraction
will
be
needed
and
you
will
find
that
neither
children
nor
parents
will
tire
of
examining
your
city
as
a
whole
and
in
detail
exclaiming
at
its
beauty
and
marvelling
at
its
ingenuity
and
the
children
will
love
it
and
so
will
you
if
you
are
disposed
to
take
a
little
more
trouble
with
your
towers
you
can
cover
them
with
cement
and
mould
the
crenellations
and
windows
with
your
fingers
the
cement
is
made
of
newspaper
size
and
whitening
tear
up
two
newspapers
and
boil
them
in
four
quarts
of
water
for
three
hours
then
pound
the
paper
in
a
large
mortar
or
squeeze
it
in
your
hands
till
it
is
all
pulp
it
will
have
an
unpleasing
grey
colour
at
this
stage
but
in
the
end
it
will
be
creamy
white
then
add
equal
quantities
of
size
and
whitening
and
a
pinch
of
yellow
ochre
mix
thoroughly
and
let
the
mixture
get
cold
when
it
is
ready
for
use
if
it
is
too
thin
warm
it
again
and
add
more
whitening
but
do
not
let
the
mixture
after
the
size
has
been
added
when
the
mixture
with
which
you
have
covered
your
tower
is
dry
it
takes
some
days
it
will
be
as
hard
as
stone
a
cocoa
tin
set
on
a
treacle
tin
makes
a
very
neat
tower
as
you
will
see
by
the
picture
square
towers
can
also
be
made
in
this
way
by
covering
square
tins
with
the
cement
in
fact
with
a
little
trouble
and
some
tins
of
different
sizes
and
shapes
you
could
build
a
whole
palace
in
this
way
doors
can
be
made
of
black
paper
and
lattices
of
paper
cut
and
folded
with
black
paper
behind
it
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
by
the
picture
chapter
viii
the
end
you
will
have
noticed
that
though
i
began
by
pointing
out
that
children
differ
as
much
as
people
do
and
that
the
individual
character
and
temperament
of
one
child
are
not
the
character
and
temperament
of
another
yet
i
have
throughout
spoken
of
the
needs
of
the
child
as
though
the
needs
of
all
children
were
the
same
that
is
because
in
the
body
of
this
work
i
have
been
dealing
with
the
needs
of
children
as
a
genus
and
not
with
those
of
the
individual
or
species
there
are
certain
needs
common
to
all
children
needs
as
universal
as
the
need
for
food
raiment
warmth
and
light
such
are
the
needs
for
sympathy
and
justice
leisure
and
liberty
these
things
are
admitted
by
all
but
the
driest
economists
to
be
the
rights
of
adults
but
not
alas
always
admitted
as
the
rights
of
children
and
i
have
tried
to
show
a
little
what
it
is
that
is
essential
to
the
true
of
all
children
the
hungers
and
thirsts
of
the
individual
spirit
can
not
be
dealt
with
by
any
but
those
in
close
relation
to
the
individual
child
i
have
tried
to
lay
down
broad
outlines
to
make
suggestions
to
point
out
pleasant
ways
leading
to
pleasant
places
parents
teachers
pastors
and
masters
will
make
the
application
or
the
variation
in
every
individual
case
one
of
the
things
that
is
the
matter
with
modern
education
is
the
absence
of
the
conception
of
personal
idiosyncrasies
tastes
character
and
temperament
for
the
matter
of
that
it
is
this
indifference
to
personality
which
makes
the
whole
of
our
civilisation
vulgar
and
vain
our
education
treats
children
as
though
they
were
all
cast
in
one
mould
it
treats
men
and
women
as
though
they
in
their
sphere
differed
not
at
all
one
from
another
you
will
say
that
it
is
impossible
in
a
great
country
and
a
great
school
to
find
out
the
personal
tastes
and
wishes
hopes
dreams
powers
and
possibilities
of
individuals
and
you
are
quite
right
that
is
why
large
schools
and
large
communities
fail
so
detestably
in
the
very
objects
of
their
existence
schools
are
intended
to
educate
and
they
merely
instruct
communities
are
at
least
i
suppose
they
are
intended
to
enable
their
members
to
live
happy
and
useful
lives
as
free
citizens
and
they
only
succeed
in
making
slaves
of
the
many
and
tyrants
of
the
few
the
machinery
of
government
and
the
machinery
of
education
is
too
big
what
it
has
to
deal
with
is
too
big
for
any
fine
result
to
be
possible
if
we
are
ever
to
get
out
of
children
and
men
and
women
anything
like
the
best
of
which
they
are
capable
we
shall
have
to
have
much
smaller
schools
and
much
smaller
communities
some
sort
of
beautiful
and
useful
corporate
life
is
possible
in
a
place
the
size
of
bedford
it
is
not
possible
in
a
place
the
size
of
london
ten
or
twenty
children
in
a
class
can
be
treated
as
individual
human
beings
and
the
best
that
is
in
them
drawn
out
by
a
sympathetic
understanding
of
personal
traits
and
characteristics
but
a
class
of
seventy
or
eighty
must
be
treated
as
a
machine
of
which
the
little
live
units
are
but
wheels
and
cogs
it
can
as
a
machine
be
made
to
do
certain
things
the
component
parts
of
it
can
be
made
to
contribute
their
share
to
the
general
result
even
as
the
bright
and
helpless
parts
of
a
machine
contribute
to
its
activity
but
you
can
never
get
out
of
the
children
composing
such
a
class
anything
approaching
the
fine
result
which
can
be
achieved
by
an
education
based
on
the
broad
lines
of
what
is
good
for
with
a
superstructure
of
delicate
perception
of
what
is
good
for
the
dick
tom
and
harry
can
join
in
certain
lessons
and
certain
games
but
there
will
always
be
some
matters
in
which
dick
is
not
in
the
least
like
tom
and
harry
is
quite
different
from
both
the
others
the
people
who
govern
us
talk
about
education
they
talk
greatly
and
a
little
they
do
but
they
will
not
do
the
one
simple
straightforward
thing
which
is
as
essential
to
the
growth
of
the
mind
as
vital
religion
is
to
the
growth
of
the
soul
any
teacher
in
any
elementary
school
knows
what
is
needed
but
those
in
power
do
not
know
it
they
will
make
scholarships
as
plentiful
as
blackberries
they
will
do
all
sorts
of
fine
things
for
secondary
education
the
one
thing
they
will
not
do
is
to
the
size
of
the
in
elementary
schools
and
so
long
as
this
is
not
done
the
millions
we
spend
yearly
on
education
are
to
a
pitiably
great
extent
millions
wasted
we
might
almost
as
well
take
at
least
half
the
money
put
it
in
bags
tie
it
up
with
red
tape
and
drop
it
over
london
bridge
or
still
better
spend
the
money
in
monthly
exhibitions
of
free
fireworks
which
would
at
least
give
the
children
and
the
one
jolly
evening
in
thirty
a
small
class
can
be
taught
and
taught
well
by
a
teacher
of
as
average
ability
as
ever
tumbled
head
over
heels
from
london
to
york
but
a
large
class
your
average
teacher
will
never
get
at
at
all
it
takes
a
genius
and
an
orator
to
speak
intelligibly
to
more
than
fifteen
people
i
sometimes
wonder
if
teachers
know
how
much
of
their
teaching
their
scholars
miss
altogether
fail
to
see
fail
to
grasp
do
not
know
is
there
between
the
careless
or
overworked
teacher
and
the
timid
and
rather
stupid
child
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
to
such
a
child
the
voice
of
the
teacher
is
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
crying
quite
aimlessly
in
a
wilderness
of
unintelligible
jargon
many
boys
in
public
as
well
as
elementary
schools
by
the
way
go
through
their
whole
school
life
scraping
through
somehow
and
never
once
having
a
clear
idea
of
anything
that
they
are
doing
hardly
ever
a
glimpse
of
what
anything
is
about
or
that
anything
has
any
reasonable
relation
to
anything
else
it
is
rather
like
a
miracle
whichever
way
you
take
it
but
there
it
is
and
a
miracle
which
might
be
made
impossible
and
unnecessary
by
a
little
sensible
commonplace
legislation
we
want
smaller
classes
and
we
want
those
classes
better
taught
that
is
to
say
we
want
more
teachers
and
teachers
we
want
our
teachers
to
be
placed
in
a
position
of
certain
comfort
that
they
shall
not
be
living
in
the
house
of
poverty
with
the
wolf
of
worry
always
nosing
round
the
door
distracting
their
attention
from
what
should
be
their
chief
thought
for
most
of
the
months
of
the
year
we
want
longer
holidays
and
a
better
provision
for
happiness
in
those
holidays
both
for
teachers
and
children
we
want
every
teacher
and
every
child
to
have
a
real
holiday
not
merely
an
absence
from
school
in
a
word
we
want
more
money
spent
on
schools
and
less
on
gaols
and
reformatories
it
can
not
be
put
too
plainly
that
the
nation
which
will
not
pay
for
her
schools
must
pay
for
her
prisons
and
asylums
people
do
seem
to
mind
so
much
paying
for
prisons
and
workhouses
what
they
really
hate
seems
to
be
paying
for
schools
and
yet
how
well
in
the
end
such
spending
would
pay
us
there
is
no
darkness
but
ignorance
and
we
have
now
such
a
chance
as
has
never
been
the
lot
of
men
since
time
began
a
chance
to
light
enough
lamps
to
dispel
that
darkness
if
only
we
would
take
that
chance
even
from
the
meanest
point
of
view
we
ought
to
take
it
it
would
be
cheaper
in
the
end
schools
are
cheaper
than
prisons
now
that
i
have
written
the
words
i
do
like
the
look
of
them
and
looking
back
through
this
book
i
see
that
most
of
what
i
have
written
applies
to
the
kind
of
children
who
are
in
little
danger
of
going
to
prison
children
in
comfortable
homes
with
enough
of
at
any
rate
material
most
of
my
book
refers
to
the
class
that
is
not
taught
in
council
schools
and
that
will
not
be
sent
to
a
reformatory
if
the
eighth
commandment
is
not
learnt
in
one
lesson
this
class
is
called
the
upper
and
it
does
not
go
to
the
council
schools
because
it
has
money
to
go
elsewhere
the
children
of
this
class
are
in
brain
and
heart
not
superior
to
the
children
of
what
are
called
the
working
classes
place
the
children
in
the
surroundings
of
the
slum
child
and
thereupon
the
child
would
grow
as
the
slum
child
grows
as
the
plant
debarred
from
light
grows
what
we
want
is
that
there
should
be
a
distribution
of
wealth
so
changed
from
the
one
that
now
destroys
the
nation
balance
as
to
put
every
parent
in
a
position
to
pay
for
his
child
education
and
that
the
nation
schools
should
be
so
superlatively
better
than
all
other
schools
that
no
parent
would
dream
of
sending
his
child
to
any
school
but
that
provided
by
the
nation
for
the
nation
children
and
now
that
it
comes
to
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
i
feel
that
i
have
only
been
touching
the
fringe
of
the
greatest
problem
in
the
world
that
there
is
very
much
which
i
have
left
unsaid
or
which
i
might
have
said
differently
and
better
one
might
go
on
for
all
one
life
thinking
and
writing
about
children
and
their
needs
and
always
there
would
be
more
unsaid
than
said
less
thought
than
food
for
thought
if
the
thoughts
which
i
have
striven
to
set
forth
give
food
for
thought
in
others
if
my
little
candle
may
help
to
kindle
a
great
torch
i
shall
look
back
on
the
writing
of
this
book
as
a
great
privilege
and
the
memory
of
the
hours
spent
on
it
i
shall
treasure
with
a
glad
and
grateful
heart
