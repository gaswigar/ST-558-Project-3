introduction
thomas
love
peacock
was
born
at
weymouth
in
his
first
poem
the
genius
of
the
thames
was
in
its
second
edition
when
he
became
one
of
the
friends
of
shelley
that
was
in
when
shelley
s
age
was
twenty
peacock
s
the
acquaintance
strengthened
until
peacock
became
the
friend
in
whose
judgment
shelley
put
especial
trust
there
were
many
points
of
agreement
peacock
at
that
time
shared
in
a
more
practical
way
shelley
s
desire
for
root
and
branch
reform
both
wore
poets
although
not
equally
gifted
and
both
loved
plato
and
the
greek
tragedians
in
crotchet
castle
peacock
has
expressed
his
own
delight
in
greek
literature
through
the
talk
of
the
reverend
folliott
but
shelley
s
friendship
for
peacock
included
a
trust
in
him
that
was
maintained
by
points
of
unlikeness
peacock
was
shrewd
and
witty
he
delighted
in
extravagance
of
a
satire
which
usually
said
more
than
it
meant
but
always
rested
upon
a
foundation
of
good
sense
then
also
there
was
a
touch
of
the
poet
to
give
grace
to
the
utterances
of
a
man
of
the
world
it
was
peacock
who
gave
its
name
to
shelley
s
poem
of
alastor
or
the
spirit
of
solitude
published
in
the
spirit
of
solitude
being
treated
as
a
spirit
of
evil
peacock
suggested
calling
it
alastor
since
the
greek
ἀλάστωρ
means
an
evil
genius
peacock
s
novels
are
unlike
those
of
other
men
they
are
the
genuine
expressions
of
an
original
and
independent
mind
his
reading
and
his
thinking
ran
together
there
is
free
quotation
free
play
of
wit
and
satire
grace
of
invention
too
but
always
unconventional
the
story
is
always
pleasant
although
always
secondary
to
the
play
of
thought
for
which
it
gives
occasion
he
quarrelled
with
verse
whimsically
but
in
all
seriousness
in
an
article
on
the
four
ages
of
poetry
contributed
in
to
a
journal
ollier
s
literary
the
four
ages
were
he
said
the
iron
age
the
bardic
the
golden
the
homeric
the
silver
the
virgilian
and
the
brass
in
which
he
himself
lived
a
poet
in
our
time
he
said
is
a
in
a
civilised
community
the
highest
inspirations
of
poetry
are
resolvable
into
three
ingredients
the
rant
of
unregulated
passion
the
whining
of
exaggerated
feeling
and
the
cant
of
factitious
sentiment
and
can
therefore
serve
only
to
ripen
a
splendid
lunatic
like
alexander
a
puling
driveller
like
werter
or
a
morbid
dreamer
like
in
another
part
of
this
essay
he
says
while
the
historian
and
the
philosopher
are
advancing
in
and
accelerating
the
progress
of
knowledge
the
poet
is
wallowing
in
the
rubbish
of
departed
ignorance
and
raking
up
the
ashes
of
dead
savages
to
find
gewgaws
and
rattles
for
the
grown
babies
of
the
age

wades
through
ponderous
volumes
of
travels
and
old
chronicles
from
which
he
carefully
selects
all
that
is
false
useless
and
absurd
as
being
essentially
poetical
and
when
he
has
a
commonplace
book
full
of
monstrosities
strings
them

of

argument

he
did
not
refer
to
shelley
and
shelley
read
his
friend
s
whimsical
attack
on
poetry
with
all
good
humour
proceeding
to
reply
to
it
with
a
defence
of
poetry
which
would
have
appeared
in
the
same
journal
if
the
journal
had
survived
in
this
novel
of
crotchet
castle
there
is
the
same
exaggeration
in
the
treatment
of
our
learned
friend
whom
and
to
whose
labours
for
the
diffusion
of
useful
knowledge
there
are
repeated
allusions
in
one
case

labours
of

learned
friend

it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
in
the
reading
that
this
story
was
written
in
the
year
before
the
passing
of
the
reform
bill
it
ends
with
a
scene
suggested
by
the
agricultural
riots
of
that
time
in
the
ninth
chapter
again
there
is
a
passage
dealing
with
sir
walter
scott
after
the
fashion
of
the
criticisms
in
the
four
ages
of
but
this
critical
satire
gave
nobody
pain
always
there
was
a
of
good
sense
and
the
broad
sweep
of
the
satire
was
utterly
unlike
the
nibbling
censure
of
the
men
whose
wit
is
tainted
with
we
may
see
also
that
the
poet
s
nature
can
not
be
expelled
in
this
volume
we
should
find
the
touch
of
a
poet
s
hand
in
the
tale
itself
when
dealing
with
the
adventures
of
chainmail
while
he
stays
at
the
welsh
mountain
inn
if
the
story
did
not
again
and
again
break
out
into
actual
song
for
it

when
peacock
wrote
his
attack
on
poetry
he
had
only
two
years
before
produced
a
poem
of
his
rhododaphne
a
greek
fancy
of
the
true
and
the
false
love
daintily
worked
out
it
was
his
chief
work
in
verse
and
gave
much
pleasure
to
a
few
among
them
his
friend
shelley
but
he
felt
that
as
the
world
went
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
help
it
by
his
singing
so
he
confined
his
writing
to
the
novels
in
which
he
could
speak
his
mind
in
his
own
way
while
doing
his
duty
by
his
country
in

of

beautiful
valleys
on

lawn
spotted
with

that
opened
itself
in
the
bosom
of
an
old
wood

rose
with
a
steep
but
not
precipitous
ascent

summit

hill
stood
the
castellated
villa
of
a
retired
citizen
ebenezer
mac
crotchet
esquire
was
the
offspring
of
a
worthy
native
of
the
north
countrie
who
had
walked
up
to
london
on
a
commercial
adventure
with
all
his
surplus
capital
not
very
neatly
tied
up
in
a
not
very
clean
handkerchief
suspended
over
his
shoulder
from
the
end
of
a
hooked
stick
extracted
from
the
first
hedge
on
his
pilgrimage
and
who
after
having
worked
himself
a
step
or
two
up
the
ladder
of
life
had
won
the
virgin
heart
of
the
only
daughter
of
a
highly
respectable
merchant
of
duke
s
place
with
whom
he
inherited
the
honest
fruits
of
a
long
series
of
ingenuous
dealings
mac
crotchet
had
derived
from
his
mother
the
instinct
and
from
his
father
the
rational
principle
of
enriching
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
of
mankind
by
all
the
recognised
modes
of
accumulation
on
the
windy
side
of
the
law
after
passing
many
years
in
the
alley
watching
the
turn
of
the
market
and
playing
many
games
almost
as
desperate
as
that
of
the
soldier
of
lucullus
the
fear
of
losing
what
he
had
so
righteously
gained
predominated
over
the
sacred
thirst
of
his
caution
got
the
better
of
his
instinct
or
rather
transferred
it
from
the
department
of
acquisition
to
that
of
conservation
his
friend
ramsbottom
the
zodiacal
mythologist
told
him
that
he
had
done
well
to
withdraw
from
the
region
of
uranus
or
brahma
the
maker
to
that
of
saturn
or
veeshnu
the
preserver
before
he
fell
under
the
eye
of
jupiter
or
seva
the
destroyer
who
might
have
struck
him
down
at
a
blow
it
is
said
that
a
scotchman
returning
home
after
some
years
residence
in
england
being
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
english
answered
they
hanna
ower
muckle
sense
but
they
are
an
unco
braw
people
to
live
amang
which
would
be
a
very
good
story
if
it
were
not
rendered
apocryphal
by
the
incredible
circumstance
of
the
scotchman
going
back
mac
crotchet
s
experience
had
given
him
a
just
title
to
make
in
his
own
person
the
observation
but
he
would
have
known
better
than
to
go
back
even
if
himself
and
not
his
father
had
been
the
first
comer
of
his
line
from
the
north
he
had
married
an
english
christian
and
having
none
of
the
scotch
accent
was
ungracious
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
his
blood
he
was
desirous
to
obliterate
alike
the
hebrew
and
caledonian
vestiges
in
his
name
and
signed
himself
crotchet
which
by
degrees
induced
the
majority
of
his
neighbours
to
think
that
his
name
was
edward
matthew
the
more
effectually
to
sink
the
mac
he
christened
his
villa
crotchet
castle
and
determined
to
hand
down
to
posterity
the
honours
of
crotchet
of
crotchet
he
found
it
essential
to
his
dignity
to
furnish
himself
with
a
coat
of
arms
which
after
the
proper
ceremonies
payment
being
the
principal
he
obtained
videlicet
crest
a
crotchet
rampant
in
a
sharp
arms
three
empty
bladders
turgescent
to
show
how
opinions
are
formed
three
bags
of
gold
pendent
to
show
why
they
are
maintained
three
naked
swords
tranchant
to
show
how
they
are
administered
and
three
barbers
blocks
gaspant
to
show
how
they
are
swallowed
crotchet
was
left
a
widower
with
two
children
and
after
the
death
of
his
wife
so
strong
was
his
sense
of
the
blessed
comfort
she
had
been
to
him
that
he
determined
never
to
give
any
other
woman
an
opportunity
of
obliterating
the
happy
recollection
he
was
not
without
a
plausible
pretence
for
styling
his
villa
a
castle
for
in
its
immediate
vicinity
and
within
his
own
enclosed
domain
were
the
manifest
traces
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
of
a
roman
station
or
which
was
still
called
the
castle
by
the
country
people
the
primitive
mounds
and
trenches
merely
overgrown
with
greensward
with
a
few
patches
of
juniper
and
box
on
the
vallum
and
a
solitary
ancient
beech
surmounting
the
place
of
the
prætorium
presented
nearly
the
same
depths
heights
slopes
and
forms
which
the
roman
soldiers
had
originally
given
them
from
this
cartel
crotchet
christened
his
villa
with
his
rustic
neighbours
he
was
of
course
immediately
and
necessarily
a
squire
squire
crotchet
of
the
castle
and
he
seemed
to
himself
to
settle
down
as
naturally
into
an
english
country
gentleman
as
if
his
parentage
had
been
as
innocent
of
both
scotland
and
jerusalem
as
his
education
was
of
rome
and
athens
but
as
though
you
expel
nature
with
a
she
will
yet
always
come
back
he
could
not
become
like
a
english
squire
part
and
parcel
of
the
earth
he
could
not
find
in
and
all
the
other
liberal
pursuits
and
pastimes
which
make
a
country
gentleman
an
ornament
to
the
world
and
a
blessing
to
the
poor
he
could
not
find
in
these
valuable
and
amiable
occupations
and
in
a
corresponding
range
of
ideas
nearly
commensurate
with
that
of
the
great
king
nebuchadnezzar
when
he
was
turned
out
to
grass
he
could
not
find
in
this
great
variety
of
useful
action
and
vast
field
of
comprehensive
thought
modes
of
filling
up
his
time
that
accorded
with
his
caledonian
instinct
the
inborn
love
of
disputation
which
the
excitements
and
engagements
of
a
life
of
business
had
smothered
burst
forth
through
the
calmer
surface
of
a
rural
life
he
grew
as
fain
as
captain
jamy
to
hear
some
argument
betwixt
ony
tway
and
being
very
hospitable
in
his
establishment
and
liberal
in
his
invitations
a
numerous
detachment
from
the
advanced
guard
of
the
march
of
intellect
often
marched
down
to
crotchet
castle
when
the
fashionable
season
filled
london
with
exhibitors
of
all
descriptions
lecturers
and
else
crotchet
was
in
his
glory
for
in
addition
to
the
perennial
literati
of
the
metropolis
he
had
the
advantage
of
the
visits
of
a
number
of
hardy
annuals
chiefly
from
the
north
who
as
the
interval
of
their
metropolitan
flowering
allowed
occasionally
accompanied
their
london
brethren
in
excursions
to
crotchet
castle
amongst
other
things
he
took
very
naturally
to
political
economy
read
all
the
books
on
the
subject
which
were
put
forth
by
his
own
countrymen
attended
all
lectures
thereon
and
boxed
the
technology
of
the
sublime
science
as
expertly
as
an
able
seaman
boxes
the
compass
with
this
agreeable
mania
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
biting
his
son
the
hope
of
his
name
and
race
who
had
borne
off
from
oxford
the
highest
academical
honours
and
who
treading
in
his
father
s
footsteps
to
honour
and
fortune
had
by
means
of
a
portion
of
the
old
gentleman
s
surplus
capital
made
himself
a
junior
partner
in
the
eminent
firm
of
catchflat
and
company
here
in
the
days
of
paper
prosperity
he
applied
his
genius
to
the
blowing
of
bubbles
the
bursting
of
which
sent
many
a
poor
devil
to
the
gaol
the
workhouse
or
the
bottom
of
the
river
but
left
young
crotchet
rolling
in
riches
these
riches
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
doubling
by
a
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
touchandgo
the
great
banker
when
one
foggy
morning
touchandgo
and
the
contents
of
his
till
were
suddenly
reported
absent
and
as
the
fortune
which
the
young
gentleman
had
intended
to
marry
was
not
forthcoming
this
tender
affair
of
the
heart
was
nipped
in
the
bud
miss
touchandgo
did
not
meet
the
shock
of
separation
quite
so
complacently
as
the
young
gentleman
for
he
lost
only
the
lady
whereas
she
lost
a
fortune
as
well
as
a
lover
some
jewels
which
had
glittered
on
her
beautiful
person
as
brilliantly
as
the
bubble
of
her
father
s
wealth
had
done
in
the
eyes
of
his
gudgeons
furnished
her
with
a
small
portion
of
and
this
added
to
the
contents
of
a
fairy
purse
of
gold
which
she
found
in
her
shoe
on
the
eventful
morning
when
touchandgo
melted
into
thin
air
enabled
her
to
retreat
into
north
wales
where
she
took
up
her
lodging
in
a
in
merionethshire
and
boarded
very
comfortably
for
a
trifling
payment
and
the
additional
consideration
of
teaching
english
french
and
music
to
the
little
in
the
course
of
this
occupation
she
acquired
sufficient
knowledge
of
welsh
to
converse
with
the
country
people
she
climbed
the
mountains
and
descended
the
dingles
with
a
foot
which
daily
habit
made
by
degrees
almost
as
steady
as
a
native
s
she
became
the
nymph
of
the
scene
and
if
she
sometimes
pined
in
thought
for
her
faithless
strephon
her
melancholy
was
anything
but
green
and
yellow
it
was
as
genuine

and
red
as

was
also
earnest
and
sometimes
successful
in
the
recommendation
of
his
mead
and
most
pertinacious
on
winter
nights
in
enforcing
a
trial
of
the
virtues
of
his
elder
wine
the
young
lady
s
personal
appearance
consequently
formed
a
very
advantageous
contrast
to
that
of
her
quondam
lover
whose
physiognomy
the
intense
anxieties
of
his
days
notwithstanding
their
triumphant
result
had
left
blighted
sallowed
and
crow
to
a
degree
not
far
below
that
of
the
fallen
spirit
who
in
the
expressive
language
of
german
romance
is
described
as
scathed
by
the
ineradicable
traces
of
the
thunderbolts
of
heaven
so
that
contemplating
their
relative
geological
positions
the
poor
deserted
damsel
was
flourishing
on
slate
while
her
rich
and
false
young
knight
was
pining
on
chalk
squire
crotchet
had
also
one
daughter
whom
he
had
christened
lemma
and
who
as
likely
to
be
endowed
with
a
very
ample
fortune
was
of
course
an
object
very
tempting
to
many
young
soldiers
of
fortune
who
were
marching
with
the
march
of
mind
in
a
good
condition
for
taking
castles
as
far
as
not
having
a
groat
is
a
qualification
for
such
exploits
she
was
also
a
glittering
bait
to
divers
young
squires
expectant
whose
fathers
were
too
well
acquainted
with
the
occult
signification
of
mortgage
and
even
to
one
or
two
sprigs
of
nobility
who
thought
that
the
lining
of
a
civic
purse
would
superinduce
a
very
passable
factitious
nap
upon
a
title
the
young
lady
had
received
an
expensive
and
complicated
education
complete
in
all
the
elements
of
superficial
display
she
was
thus
eminently
qualified
to
be
the
companion
of
any
masculine
luminary
who
had
kept
due
pace
with
the
astounding
progress
of
intelligence
it
must
be
confessed
that
a
man
who
has
not
kept
due
pace
with
it
is
not
very
easily
found
this
march
being
one
of
that
astounding
character
in
which
it
seems
impossible
that
the
rear
can
be
behind
the
van
the
young
lady
was
also
tolerably
good
looking
north
of
tweed
or
in
palestine
she
would
probable
have
been
a
beauty
but
for
the
valleys
of
the
thames
she
was
perhaps
a
little
too
much
to
the
taste
of
solomon
and
had
a
nose
which
rather
too
prominently
suggested
the
idea
of
the
tower
of
lebanon
which
looked
towards
damascus
in
a
village
in
the
vicinity
of
the
castle
was
the
vicarage
of
the
reverend
doctor
folliott
a
gentleman
endowed
with
a
tolerable
stock
of
learning
an
interminable
swallow
and
an
indefatigable
pair
of
lungs
his
in
the
latter
faculty
gave
occasion
to
some
etymologists
to
ring
changes
on
his
name
and
to
decide
that
it
was
derived
from
follis
optimus
softened
through
an
italian
medium
into
folle
ottimo
contracted
poetically
into
folleotto
and
elided
anglicé
into
folliott
signifying
a
pair
of
bellows
he
claimed
to
be
descended
lineally
from
the
illustrious
gilbert
folliott
the
eminent
theologian
who
was
a
bishop
of
london
in
the
twelfth
century
whose
studies
were
interrupted
in
the
dead
of
night
by
the
devil
when
a
couple
of
epigrams
passed
between
them
and
the
devil
of
course
proved
the
smaller
wit
of
the
two
this
reverend
gentleman
being
both
learned
and
jolly
became
by
degrees
an
indispensable
ornament
to
the
new
squire
s
table
crotchet
himself
was
eminently
jolly
though
by
no
means
eminently
learned
in
the
latter
respect
he
took
after
the
great
majority
of
the
sons
of
his
father
s
land
had
a
smattering
of
many
things
and
a
knowledge
of
none
but
possessed
the
true
northern
art
of
making
the
most

the
abuse
of

you
god
bless
my
soul
sir
exclaimed
the
reverend
doctor
folliott
bursting
one
fine
may
morning
into
the
at
crotchet
castle
i
am
out
of
all
patience
with
this
march
of
mind
here
has
my
house
been
nearly
burned
down
by
my
cook
taking
it
into
her
head
to
study
hydrostatics
in
a
sixpenny
tract
published
by
the
steam
intellect
society
and
written
by
a
learned
friend
who
is
for
doing
all
the
world
s
business
as
well
as
his
own
and
is
equally
well
qualified
to
handle
every
branch
of
human
knowledge
i
have
a
great
abomination
of
this
learned
friend
as
author
lawyer
and
politician
he
is
like
hecate
and
in
every
one
of
his
three
forms
he
is
like
janus
the
true
of
vanity
fair
my
cook
must
read
his
rubbish
in
bed
and
as
might
naturally
be
expected
she
dropped
suddenly
fast
asleep
overturned
the
candle
and
set
the
curtains
in
a
blaze
luckily
the
footman
went
into
the
room
at
the
moment
in
time
to
tear
down
the
curtains
and
throw
them
into
the
chimney
and
a
pitcher
of
water
on
her
nightcap
extinguished
her
wick
she
is
a
greasy
subject
and
would
have
burned
like
a
short
the
reverend
gentleman
exhaled
his
grievance
without
looking
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
at
length
turning
on
his
pivot
he
perceived
that
the
room
was
full
of
company
consisting
of
young
crotchet
and
some
visitors
whom
he
had
brought
from
london
the
reverend
doctor
folliott
was
introduced
to

the

took
his
seat
at

and
began
to
compose
his
spirits
by
the
gentle
sedative
of
a
large
cup
of
tea
the
demulcent
of
a
muffin
and
the
tonic
of
a
small
lobster

are
a
man
of

a
man
of

seen
at
once
in

of

chocolate
coffee

cream
eggs
ham

cold

all
these
are
good

bespeak
good
knowledge
in
him
who
sets
them
forth

the
touchstone
is
fish
anchovy

the
first
step
prawns

shrimps
the
second

i
laud
him
who
reaches
even
to
these
potted
char
and
lampreys
are
the
third
and
a
fine
stretch
of
progression
but
lobster
is
indeed
matter
for
a
may
morning
and
demands
a
rare
combination
of
knowledge
and
virtue
in
him
who
sets
it
forth
mac
sir
and
what
say
you
to
a
fine
fresh

some
eximious

in
the
glory
of

for

we
have
much
to
learn
from
you

line
at
any
rate

for

am

to

sir
well
there
is
cogency
in
a
good
supper
a
good
supper
in
these
degenerate
days
bespeaks
a
good
man
but
much
more
is
wanted
to
make
up
an
athenian
athenians
indeed
where
is
your
theatre
who
among
you
has
written
a
comedy
where
is
your
attic
salt
which
of
you
can
tell
who
was
jupiter
s
or
what
metres
will
successively
remain
if
you
take
off
the
three
first
syllables
one
by
one
from
a
pure
antispastic
acatalectic
tetrameter
now
sir
there
are
three
questions
for
you
theatrical
mythological
and
metrical
to
every
one
of
which
an
athenian
would
give
an
answer
that
would
lay
me
prostrate
in
my
own
nothingness
mac
sir
as
to
your
metre
and
your
mythology
they
may
e
en
wait
a
wee
for
your
comedy
there
is
the
gentle
shepherd
of
the
divine
allan
ramsay
rev
gentle
shepherd
it
is
just
as
much
a
comedy
as
the
book
of
job
mac
sir
if
none
of
us
have
written
a
comedy
i
can
not
see
that
it
is
any
such
great
matter
any
more
than
i
can
conjecture
what
business
a
man
can
have
at
this
time
of
day
with
jupiter
s
rev
great
business
is
sir
that
you
call
yourselves
athenians
while
you
know
nothing
that
the
athenians
thought
worth
knowing
and
dare
not
show
your
noses
before
the
civilised
world
in
the
practice
of
any
one
art
in
which
they
were
excellent
modern
athens
sir
the
assumption
is
a
personal
affront
to
every
man
who
has
a
sophocles
in
his
library
i
will
thank
you
for
an
anchovy
mac
sir
metaphysics
logic
and
moral
philosophy
there
we
are
at
home
the
athenians
only
sought
the
way
and
we
have
found
it
and
to
all
this
we
have
added
political
economy
the
science
of
sciences
rev
hyperbarbarous
technology
that
no
athenian
ear
could
have
borne
premises
assumed
without
evidence
or
in
spite
of
it
and
conclusions
drawn
from
them
so
logically
that
they
must
necessarily
be
erroneous
can
not
agree
with
you
mac
quedy
that
you
have
found
the
true
road
of
metaphysics
which
the
athenians
only
sought
the
germans
have
found
it
sir
the
sublime
kant
and
his
disciples
mac
have
read
the
sublime
kant
sir
with
an
anxious
desire
to
understand
him
and
i
confess
i
have
not
succeeded
rev
wants
the
two
great
requisites
of
head
and
tail
is
the
philosophy
of
intuition
the
development
of
universal
convictions
truths
which
are
inherent
in
the
organisation
of
mind
which
can
not
be
obliterated
though
they
may
be
obscured
by
superstitious
prejudice
on
the
one
hand
and
by
the
aristotelian
logic
on
the
other
mac
sir
i
have
no
notion
of
logic
obscuring
a
question
is
only
one
true
logic
which
is
the
transcendental
and
this
can
prove
only
the
one
true
philosophy
which
is
also
the
transcendental
the
logic
of
your
modern
athens
can
prove
everything
equally
and
that
is
in
my
opinion
tantamount
to
proving
nothing
at
all
sentimental
against
the
rational
the
intuitive
against
the
inductive
the
ornamental
against
the
useful
the
intense
against
the
tranquil
the
romantic
against
the
classical
these
are
great
and
interesting
controversies
which
i
should
like
before
i
die
to
see
satisfactorily
settled
is
another
great
question
greater
than
all
these
seeing
that
it
is
necessary
to
be
alive
in
order
to
settle
any
question
and
this
is
the
question
of
water
against
human
life
wherever
there
is
water
there
is
malaria
and
wherever
there
is
malaria
there
are
the
elements
of
death
the
great
object
of
a
wise
man
should
be
to
live
on
a
gravelly
hill
without
so
much
as
a
within
ten
miles
of
him
eschewing
cisterns
and
waterbutts
and
taking
care
that
there
be
no
for
lodging

rain

sun
sucks
up
infection
from
water
wherever
it
exists
on
the
face
of
the
earth

sir
you
have
for
you
the
authority
of
the
ancient
mystagogue
who
said
εστιν
ὔδωρ

for
my
part
i
care
not
a
rush
or
any
other
aquatic
and
inesculent
vegetable
who
or
what
sucks
up
either
the
water
or
the
infection
i
think
the
proximity
of
wine
a
matter
of
much
more
importance
than
the
longinquity
of
water
you
are
here
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
thames

in

cellar
of
my

is
the
talismanic
antidote
of
a
thousand
dozen
of
old
wine
a
beautiful
spectacle
i
assure
you
and

of

feel
the
malignant
influence

great

brought

so
nearly

after
dinner
i
will
meet
you
on
this
question

shall
then
be
armed

strife

when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
young
gentleman
who
was
sitting
on
a
camp
stool
with
a
portfolio
on
his
knee
taking
a
sketch
of
the
roman
camp
which
as
has
been
already
said
was
within
the
enclosed
domain
of
crotchet
the
young
stranger
who
had
climbed
over
the
fence
espying
the
portly
divine
rose
up
and
hoped
that
he
was
not
trespassing
by
no
means

sir
and
a
liberal
and
discriminating
hospitality
this
is
an
old
british
camp
i
believe
sir
rev
sir
roman
undeniably
roman
the
vallum
is
past
controversy
it
was
not
a
camp
sir
a
but
a
a
little
camp
or
to
which
was
attached
on
the
peak
of
the
adjacent
hill
a
beacon
for
transmitting
alarms
you
will
find
such
here
and
there
all
along
the
range
of
chalk
hills
which
traverses
the
country
from
to
and
along
the
base
of
which
runs
the
ancient
iknield
road
whereof
you
may
descry
a
portion
in
that
long
straight
white
line
beg
your
pardon
sir
do
i
understand
this
place
to
be
your
property
rev
is
not
mine
sir
the
more
is
the
pity
yet
is
it
so
far
well
that
the
owner
is
my
good
friend
and
a
highly
respectable
gentleman
and
respectable
sir
i
take
it
means
rich
rev
is
their
meaning
sir
understand
the
owner
to
be
a
crotchet
he
has
a
handsome
daughter
i
am
told
rev
has
sir
her
eyes
are
like
the
of
heshbon
by
the
gate
of
bethrabbim
and
she
is
to
have
a
handsome
fortune
to
which
divers
disinterested
gentlemen
are
paying
their
addresses
perhaps
you
design
to
be
one
of
them
sir
i
beg
pardon
if
my
questions
seem
impertinent
i
have
no
such
design
there
is
a
son
too
i
believe
sir
a
great
and
successful
blower
of
bubbles
rev
hero
sir
in
his
line
never
did
angler
in
september
hook
more
gudgeons
say
the
truth
two
very
amiable
young
people
with
whom
i
have
some
little
acquaintance
lord
bossnowl
and
his
sister
lady
clarinda
are
reported
to
be
on
the
point
of
concluding
a
double
marriage
with
miss
crotchet
and
her
brother
by
way
of
putting
a
new
varnish
on
old
nobility
lord
foolincourt
their
father
is
terribly
poor
for
a
lord
who
owns
a
borough
rev
sir
the
crotchets
have
plenty
of
money
and
the
old
gentleman
s
weak
point
is
a
hankering
after
high
blood
i
saw
your
acquaintance
lord
bossnowl
this
morning
but
i
did
not
see
his
sister
she
may
be
there
nevertheless
and
doing
fashionable
justice
to
this
fine
may
morning
by
lying
in
bed
till
noon
crotchet
sir
has
been
like
his
father
the
architect
of
his
own
fortune
has
he
not
an
illustrious
example
of
the
reward
of
honesty
and
industry
rev
to
honesty
sir
he
made
his
fortune
in
the
city
of
london
and
if
that
commodity
be
of
any
value
there
you
will
find
it
in
the
price
current
i
believe
it
is
below
par
like
the
shares
of
young
crotchet
s
fifty
companies
but
his
progress
has
not
been
exactly
like
his
father
s
it
has
been
more
rapid
and
he
started
with
more
advantages
he
began
with
a
fine
capital
from
his
father
the
old
gentleman
divided
his
fortune
into
three
not
exactly
equal
portions
one
for
himself
one
for
his
daughter
and
one
for
his
son
which
he
handed
over
to
him
saying
take
it
once
for
all
and
make
the
most
of
it
if
you
lose
it
where
i
won
it
not
another
stiver
do
you
get
from
me
during
my
but
sir
young
crotchet
doubled
and
trebled
and
quadrupled
it
and
is
as
you
say
a
striking
example
of
the
reward
of
industry
not
that
i
think
his
labour
has
been
so
great
as
his
luck
sir
is
all
this
solid
is
there
no
danger
of
reaction
no
day
of
reckoning
to
cut
down
in
an
hour
prosperity
that
has
grown
up
like
a
mushroom
rev
sir
i
know
not
i
do
not
pry
into
these
matters
i
am
for
my
own
part
very
well
satisfied
with
the
young
gentleman
let
those
who
are
not
so
look
to
themselves
it
is
quite
enough
for
me
that
he
came
down
last
night
from
london
and
that
he
had
the
good
sense
to
bring
with
him
a
basket
of
lobsters
sir
i
wish
you
a
good
morning
the
stranger
having
returned
the
reverend
gentleman
s
good
morning
resumed
his
sketch
and
was
intently
employed
on
it
when
crotchet
made
his
appearance
with
mac
quedy
and
skionar
whom
he
was
escorting
round
his
grounds
according
to
his
custom
with
new
visitors
the
principal
pleasure
of
possessing
an
extensive
domain
being
that
of
showing
it
to
other
people
mac
quedy
according
also
to
the
laudable
custom
of
his
countrymen
had
been
appraising
everything
that
fell
under
his
observation
but
on
arriving
at
the
roman
camp
of
which
the
value
was
purely
imaginary
he
contented
himself
with
exclaiming
eh
this
is
just
a
curiosity
and
very
pleasant
to
sit
in
on
a
summer
call
up
the
days
of
old
when
the
roman
eagle
spread
its
wings
in
the
place
of
that
beechen
foliage
it
gives
a
fine
idea
of
duration
to
think
that
that
fine
old
tree
must
have
sprung
from
the
earth
ages
after
this
camp
was
formed
mac
old
think
you
may
the
tree
be
have
records
which
show
it
to
be
three
hundred
years
old
mac
is
a
great
age
for
a
beech
in
good
condition
but
you
see
the
camp
is
some
fifteen
hundred
years
or
so
older
and
three
times
six
being
eighteen
i
think
you
get
a
clearer
idea
of
duration
out
of
the
simple
arithmetic
than
out
of
your
eagle
and
foliage
is
a
very
unpoetical
if
not
unphilosophical
mode
of
viewing
antiquities
your
philosophy
is
too
literal
for
our
imperfect
vision
we
can
not
look
directly
into
the
nature
of
things
we
can
only
catch
glimpses
of
the
mighty
shadow
in
the
camera
obscura
of
transcendental
intelligence
these
six
and
eighteen
are
only
words
to
which
we
give
conventional
meanings
we
can
reason
but
we
can
not
feel
by
help
of
them
the
tree
and
the
eagle
contemplated
in
the
ideality
of
space
and
time
become
subjective
realities
that
rise
up
as
landmarks
in
the
mystery
of
the
past
mac
sir
if
you
understand
that
i
wish
you
joy
but
i
must
be
excused
for
holding
that
my
proposition
three
times
six
are
eighteen
is
more
intelligible
than
yours
a
worthy
friend
of
mine
who
is
a
sort
of
amateur
in
philosophy
criticism
politics
and
a
wee
bit
of
many
things
more
says
men
never
begin
to
study
antiquities
till
they
are
saturated
with
is
civilisation
mac
is
just
respect
for
property
a
state
in
which
no
man
takes
wrongfully
what
belongs
to
another
is
a
perfectly
civilised
state
friend
s
antiquaries
must
have
lived
in
el
dorado
to
have
had
an
opportunity
of
being
saturated
with
such
a
state
mac
is
a
question
of
degree
there
is
more
respect
for
property
here
than
in
angola
depends
on
the
light
in
which
things
are
viewed
crotchet
was
rubbing
his
hands
in
hopes
of
a
fine
discussion
when
they
came
round
to
the
side
of
the
camp
where
the
picturesque
gentleman
was
sketching
the
stranger
was
rising
up
when
crotchet
begged
him
not
to
disturb
himself
and
presently
walked
away
with
his
two
guests
shortly
after
miss
crotchet
and
lady
clarinda
who
had
breakfasted
by
themselves
made
their
appearance
at
the
same
spot
hanging
each
on
an
arm
of
lord
bossnowl
who
very
much
preferred
their
company
to
that
of
the
philosophers
though
he
would
have
preferred
the
company
of
the
latter
or
any
company
to
his
own
he
thought
it
very
singular
that
so
agreeable
a
person
as
he
held
himself
to
be
to
others
should
be
so
exceedingly
tiresome
to
himself
he
did
not
attempt
to
investigate
the
cause
of
this
phenomenon
but
was
contented
with
acting
on
his
knowledge
of
the
fact
and
giving
himself
as
little
of
his
own
private
society
as
possible
the
stranger
rose
as
they
approached
and
was
immediately
recognised
by
the
bossnowls
as
an
old
acquaintance
and
saluted
with
the
exclamation
of
captain
fitzchrome
the
interchange
of
salutations
between
lady
clarinda
and
the
captain
was
accompanied
with
an
amiable
confusion
on
both
sides
in
which
the
observant
eyes
of
miss
crotchet
seemed
to
read
the
recollection
of
an
affair
of
the
heart
lord
bossnowl
was
either
unconscious
of
any
such
affair
or
indifferent
to
its
existence
he
introduced
the
captain
very
cordially
to
miss
crotchet
and
the
young
lady
invited
him
as
the
friend
of
their
guests
to
partake
of
her
father
s
hospitality
an
offer
which
was
readily
accepted
the
captain
took
his
portfolio
under
his
right
arm
his
camp
stool
in
his
right
hand
offered
his
left
arm
to
lady
clarinda
and
followed
at
a
reasonable
distance
behind
miss
crotchet
and
lord
bossnowl
contriving
in
the
most
natural
manner
possible
to
drop
more
and
more
into
the
rear
am
glad
to
see
you
can
make
yourself
so
happy
with
drawing
old
trees
and
mounds
of
grass
lady
clarinda
oh
no
how
can
i
be
happy
when
i
see
the
idol
of
my
heart
about
to
be
sacrificed
on
the
shrine
of
mammon
you
know
though
mammon
has
a
sort
of
ill
name
i
really
think
he
is
a
very
popular
character
there
must
be
at
the
bottom
something
amiable
about
him
he
is
certainly
one
of
those
pleasant
creatures
whom
everybody
abuses
but
without
whom
no
evening
party
is
endurable
i
dare
say
love
in
a
cottage
is
very
pleasant
but
then
it
positively
must
be
a
cottage
ornée
but
would
not
the
same
love
be
a
great
deal
safer
in
a
castle
even
if
mammon
furnished
the
fortification
lady
clarinda
there
is
a
heartlessness
in
that
language
that
chills
me
to
the
soul
no
my
heart
is
on
my
lips
i
speak
just
what
i
think
you
used
to
like
it
and
say
it
was
as
delightful
as
it
was
rare
but
you
did
not
then
talk
as
you
do
now
of
love
in
a
castle
but
only
consider
a
dun
is
a
horridly
vulgar
creature
it
is
a
creature
i
can
not
endure
the
thought
of
and
a
cottage
lets
him
in
so
easily
now
a
castle
keeps
him
at
bay
you
are
a
officer
and
are
at
leisure
to
command
the
garrison
but
where
is
the
castle
and
who
is
to
furnish
the
commissariat
it
come
to
this
that
you
make
a
jest
of
my
poverty
yet
is
my
poverty
only
comparative
many
decent
families
are
maintained
on
smaller
means
families
ay
decent
is
the
distinction
from
respectable
respectable
means
rich
and
decent
means
poor
i
should
die
if
i
heard
my
family
called
decent
and
then
your
decent
family
always
lives
in
a
snug
little
place
i
hate
a
little
place
i
like
large
rooms
and
large
and
large
parties
and
a
fine
large
butler
with
a
tinge
of
smooth
red
in
his
face
an
outward
and
visible
sign
that
the
family
he
serves
is
respectable
if
not
noble
highly
respectable
can
not
believe
that
you
say
all
this
in
earnest
no
man
is
less
disposed
than
i
am
to
deny
the
importance
of
the
substantial
comforts
of
life
i
once
flattered
myself
that
in
our
estimate
of
these
things
we
were
nearly
of
a
mind
you
know
i
think
an
a
very
substantial
comfort
and
a
carriage
you
will
tell
me
that
many
decent
people
walk
through
the
snow
and
sit
in
clogs
and
bonnets
in
the
pit
at
the
english
theatre
no
doubt
it
is
very
pleasant
to
those
who
are
used
to
it
but
it
is
not
to
my
taste
always
delighted
in
trying
to
provoke
me
but
i
can
not
believe
that
you
have
not
a
heart
do
not
like
to
believe
that
i
have
a
heart
you
mean
you
wish
to
think
i
have
lost
it
and
you
know
to
whom
and
when
i
tell
you
that
it
is
still
safe
in
my
own
keeping
and
that
i
do
not
mean
to
give
it
away
the
unreasonable
creature
grows
angry
far
from
it
i
am
perfectly
cool
you
are
pursing
your
brows
biting
your
lips
and
lifting
up
your
foot
as
if
you
would
stamp
it
into
the
earth
i
must
say
anger
becomes
you
you
would
make
a
charming
hotspur
your
face
is
rather
insipid
but
i
assure
you
my
heart
is
in
danger
when
you
are
in
the
heroics
it
is
so
rare
too
in
these
days
of
smooth
manners
to
see
anything
like
natural
expression
in
a
man
s
face
there
is
one
set
form
for
every
man
s
face
in
female
society
a
sort
of
serious
comedy
walking
gentleman
s
face
but
the
moment
the
creature
falls
in
love
he
begins
to
give
himself
airs
and
plays
off
all
the
varieties
of
his
physiognomy
from
the
master
slender
to
the
petruchio
and
then
he
is
actually
very
amusing
lady
clarinda
i
will
not
be
angry
amusing
as
it
may
be
to
you
i
listen
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
i
half
believe
you
in
earnest
and
mourn
as
over
a
fallen
angel
because
i
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
give
away
my
heart
when
i
can
sell
it
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
new
acquaintance
mac
quedy
he
will
talk
to
you
by
the
hour
about
exchangeable
value
and
show
you
that
no
rational
being
will
part
with
anything
except
to
the
highest
bidder
i
am
sure
you
are
not
in
earnest
you
can
not
adopt
such
sentiments
in
their
naked
deformity
deformity
why
mac
quedy
will
prove
to
you
that
they
are
the
cream
of
the
most
refined
philosophy
you
live
a
very
pleasant
life
as
a
bachelor
roving
about
the

if
i
displease

i
shall
not
have
as
much
as
will
buy
the
string
to
say
nothing
of
the
meat
and
the
bare
idea
of
such
cookery
gives
me
the
horrors
by
this
time
they
were
near
the
castle
and
met
miss
crotchet
and
her
companion
who
had
turned
back
to
meet
them
captain
fitzchrome
was
shortly
after
heartily
welcomed
by
crotchet
and
the
party
separated
to
dress
for
dinner
the
captain
being
by
no
means
in
an
enviable
state
of
mind
and
full
of
misgivings
as
to
the
extent
of
belief
that
he
was
bound
to
accord
to
the
words
of
the
lady
of
his
heart

if
i
were
sketching
a
bandit
who
had
just
shot
his
last
pursuer
having
outrun
all
the
rest
that
is
the
very
face
i
would
give
him
soliloquised
the
captain
as
he
studied
the
features
of
his
rival
in
the
during
the
miserable
before
dinner
when
dulness
reigns
predominant
over
expectant
company
especially
when
they
are
waiting
for
some
one
last
comer
whom
they
all
heartily
curse
in
their
hearts
and
whom
nevertheless
or
indeed
they
welcome
as
a
sinner
more
heartily
than
all
the
just
persons
who
had
been
punctual
to
their
engagement
some
new
visitors
had
arrived
in
the
morning
and
as
the
company
dropped
in
one
by
one
the
captain
anxiously
watched
the
unclosing
door
for
the
form
of
his
beloved
but
she
was
the
last
to
make
her
appearance
and
on
her
entry
gave
him
a
malicious
glance
which
he
construed
into
a
telegraphic
communication
that
she
had
stayed
away
to
torment
him
young
crotchet
escorted
her
with
marked
attention
to
the
upper
end
of
the
where
a
great
portion
of
the
company
was
congregated
around
miss
crotchet
these
being
the
only
ladies
in
the
company
it
was
evident
that
old
crotchet
would
give
his
arm
to
lady
clarinda
an
arrangement
with
which
the
captain
could
not
interfere
he
therefore
took
his
station
near
the
door
studying
his
rival
from
a
distance
and
determined
to
take
advantage
of
his
present
position
to
secure
the
seat
next
to
his
charmer
he
was
meditating
on
the
best
mode
of
operation
for
securing
this
important
post
with
due
regard
to
when
he
was
twitched
by
the
button
by
mac
quedy
who
said
to
him
lady
clarinda
tells
me
sir
that
you
are
anxious
to
talk
with
me
on
the
subject
of
exchangeable
value
from
which
i
infer
that
you
have
studied
political
economy
and
as
a
great
deal
depends
on
the
definition
of
value
i
shall
be
glad
to
set
you
right
on
that
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
sir
said
the
captain
and
was
about
to
express
his
utter
disqualification
for
the
proposed
instruction
when
skionar
walked
up
and
said
lady
clarinda
informs
me
that
you
wish
to
talk
over
with
me
the
question
of
subjective
reality
i
am
delighted
to
fall
in
with
a
gentleman
who
daily
appreciates
the
transcendental
lady
clarinda
is
too
good
said
the
captain
and
was
about
to
protest
that
he
had
never
heard
the
word
transcendental
before
when
the
butler
announced
dinner
crotchet
led
the
way
with
lady
clarinda
lord
bossnowl
followed
with
miss
crotchet
the
economist
and
transcendentalist
pinned
in
the
captain
and
held
him
one
by
each
arm
as
he
impatiently
descended
the
stairs
in
the
rear
of
several
others
of
the
company
whom
they
had
forced
him
to
let
pass
but
the
moment
he
entered
the
he
broke
loose
from
them
and
at
the
expense
of
a
little
secured
his
position
well
captain
said
lady
clarinda
i
perceive
you
can
still
what
could
possess
you
said
the
captain
to
send
two
unendurable
and
inconceivable
bores
to
intercept
me
with
rubbish
about
which
i
neither
know
nor
care
any
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
perhaps
said
lady
clarinda
i
saw
your
design
and
wished
to
put
your
generalship
to
the
test
but
do
not
contradict
anything
i
have
said
about
you
and
see
if
the
learned
will
find
you
there
is
fine
music

rabelais
observes
in
the

in

said
a
voice
at
the
captain
s
elbow
the
captain
turning
round
recognised
his
clerical
friend
of
the
morning
who
knew
him
again
immediately
and
said
he
was
extremely
glad
to
meet
him
there
more
especially
as
lady
clarinda
had
assured
him
that
he
was
an
enthusiastic
lover
of
greek
poetry
lady
clarinda
said
the
captain
is
a
very
pleasant
young
rev
she
is
sir
and
i
understand
she
has
all
the
wit
of
the
family
to
herself
whatever
that
may
be
but
a
glass
of
wine
after
soup
is
as
the
french
say
the
de
the
current
of
opinion
sets
in
favour
of
hock
but
i
am
for

i
do
not
fancy
hock
till
i
have
laid
a
substratum
of

you
join

pleasure
rev
is
a
very
fine
salmon
before
me
and
may
is
the
very
to
have
salmon
in
perfection
there
is
a
fine
turbot
close
by
and
there
is
much
to
be
said
in
his
behalf
but
salmon
in
may
is
the
king
of
fish
salmon
before
you
doctor
was
caught
in
the
thames
this
morning
rev
rarity
of
rarities
a
thames
salmon
caught
this
morning
now
mac
quedy
even
in
fish
your
modern
athens
must
yield
mac
sir
on
its
own
around
your
thames
salmon
has
two
virtues
over
all
others
first
that
it
is
fresh
and
second
that
it
is
rare
for
i
understand
you
do
not
take
half
a
dozen
in
a
year
rev
some
years
sir
not
one
mud
filth
and
the
march
of
mind
developed
in
the
form
of
poaching
have
ruined
the
fishery
but
when
we
do
catch
a
salmon
happy
the
man
to
whom
he
falls
mac
confess
sir
this
is
excellent
but
i
can
not
see
why
it
should
be
better
than
a
tweed
salmon
at
kelso
rev
i
will
take
a
glass
of
hock
with
you
mac
all
my
heart
sir
there
are
several
varieties
of
the
salmon
genus
but
the
common
salmon
the
is
only
one
species
one
and
the
same
everywhere
just
like
the
human
mind
locality
and
education
make
all
the
difference
rev
well
sir
i
have
no
doubt
schools
for
all
are
just
as
fit
for
the
species
as
for
the
genus
but
you
must
allow
that
the
specimen
before
us
has
finished
his
education
in
a
manner
that
does
honour
to
his
college
however
i
doubt
that
the
is
only
one
species
that
is
to
say
precisely
alike
in
all
localities
i
hold
that
every
river
has
its
own
breed
with
essential
differences
in
flavour
especially
and
as
for
the
human
mind
i
deny
that
it
is
the
same
in
all
men
i
hold
that
there
is
every
variety
of
natural
capacity
from
the
idiot
to
newton
and
shakespeare
the
mass
of
mankind
midway
between
these
extremes
being
blockheads
of
different
degrees
education
leaving
them
pretty
nearly
as
it
found
them
with
this
single
difference
that
it
gives
a
fixed
direction
to
their
stupidity
a
sort
of
incurable
wry
neck
to
the
thing
they
call
their
understanding
so
one
nose
points
always
east
and
another
always
west
and
each
is
ready
to
swear
that
it
points
due
north
that
be
the
point
of
truth
very
few
intellectual
noses
point
due
north
mac
those
that
point
to
the
modern
athens
rev
all
native
noses
point
southward
mac
sir
northward
for
wisdom
and
southward
for
profit
champagne
doctor
rev
willingly
but
you
will
permit
my
drinking
it
while
it

it
a

to
let
it
deaden
in
my
hand
while
the
glass
of
my
is
being
filled
on
the
opposite
side
of
the

captain
you
remember
a
passage
in
athenæus
where
he
cites
menander
on
the
subject
of
ὀψάριον
ἐπὶ
ἰχθύος
the
captain
was
aghast
for
an
answer
that
would
satisfy
both
his
neighbours
when
he
was
relieved
by
the
divine
continuing
the
science
of
mac
quedy
is
by
no
means
brought
to
perfection
a
fine
field
of
discovery
still
lies
open
in
that
line
mac

i
take
it
ye
can
not
go
rev
their
line
i
grant
you
oyster
and
are
the
pillars
of
hercules
but
i
speak
of
the
cruet
sauces
where
the
quintessence
of
the
sapid
is
condensed
in
a
phial
i
can
taste
in
my
mind
s
palate
a
combination
which
if
i
could
give
it
reality
i
would
christen
with
the
name
of
my
college
and
hand
it
down
to
posterity
as
a
seat
of
learning
indeed
mac
sir
i
wish
you
success
but
i
can
not
let
slip
the
question
we
started
just
now
i
say
cutting
off
idiots
who
have
no
minds
at
all
all
minds
are
by
nature
alike
education
which
begins
from
their
birth
makes
them
what
they
are
rev
sir
it
makes
their
tendencies
not
their
power
cæsar
would
have
been

first

education
might
have
made
him

might
also
have
made
him

washington
it
could
not
have
made
him
a
for
our
newspapers
to
extol
as
a
model
of
eloquence
mac
sir
i
think
education
would
have
made
him
just
anything
and
fit
for
any
station
from
the
throne
to
the
stocks
saint
or
sinner
aristocrat
or
democrat
judge
counsel
or

will
thank
you
for
a
slice

with

before
i
proceed
with
this
discussion
de
grave
skionar
must
interpose
one
remark
there
is
a
set
of
persons
in
your
city
mac
quedy
who
concoct
every
three
or
four
months
a
thing
which
they
call
a
review
a
sort
of
manufacturers
to
the
whig
aristocracy
mac
can
not
tell
sir
exactly
what
you
mean
by
that
but
i
hope
you
will
speak
of
those
gentlemen
with
respect
seeing
that
i
am
one
of
them
rev
i
must
drown
my
inadvertence
in
a
glass
of
sauterne
with
you
there
is
a
set
of
gentlemen
in
your
mac
in
our
city
exactly
neither
are
they
a
set
there
is
an
editor
who
forages
for
articles
in
all
quarters
from
john
o
groat
s
house
to
the
land
s
end
it
is
not
a
board
or
a
society
it
is
a
mere
intellectual
bazaar
where
a
b
and
c
bring
their
wares
to
market
rev
sir
these
gentlemen
among
them
the
present
company
excepted
have
practised
as
much
dishonesty
as
in
any
other
department
than
literature
would
have
brought
the
practitioner
under
the
cognisance
of
the
police
in
politics
they
have
ran
with
the
hare
and
hunted
with
the
hound
in
criticism
they
have
knowingly
and
unblushingly
given
false
characters
both
for
good
and
for
evil
sticking
at
no
art
of
misrepresentation
to
clear
out
of
the
field
of
literature
all
who
stood
in
the
way
of
the
interests
of
their
own
clique
they
have
never
allowed
their
own
profound
ignorance
of
anything
greek
for
instance
to
throw
even
an
air
of
hesitation
into
their
oracular
decision
on
the
matter
they
set
an
example
of
profligate
contempt
for
truth
of
which
the
success
was
in
proportion
to
the
effrontery
and
when
their
prosperity
had
filled
the
market
with
competitors
they
cried
out
against
their
own
reflected
sin
as
if
they
had
never
committed
it
or
were
entitled
to
a
monopoly
of
it

latter
i
rather
think
was
what
they
wanted

the

my

at
the
head
of

who
is

leaning

very

fond

people
that
talk
nonsense
logically
he
is
fond
of

himself
when
there
are

or
two
but
seldom
does
more
than
listen
in
a
large
company
of
he
made
a
great
fortune
in
the
city
and
has
the
comfort
of
a
good
conscience
he
is
very
hospitable
and
is
generous
in
dinners
though
nothing
would
induce
him
to
give
sixpence
to
the
poor
because
he
holds
that
all
misfortune
is
from
imprudence
that
none
but
the
rich
ought
to
marry
and
that
all
ought
to
thrive
by
honest
industry
as
he
did
he
is
ambitious
of
founding
a
family
and
of
allying
himself
with
nobility
and
is
thus
as
willing
as
other
grown
children
to

away
thousands

he
would
not

with
a
penny
for

next
to
him
is
my
brother
whom
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
he
has
finished
his
education
with
credit
and
as
he
never
ventures
to
oppose
me
in
anything
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
very
sensible
he
has
good
manners
is
a
model
of
dress
and
is
reckoned
ornamental
in
all
societies
next
to
him
is
miss
crotchet
my
that
is
to
be
you
see
she
is
rather
pretty
and
very
genteel
she
is
tolerably
accomplished
has
her
table
always
covered
with
new
novels
thinks
mac
quedy
an
oracle
and
is
extremely
desirous
to
be
called
my
next
to
her
is
firedamp
a
very
absurd
person
who
thinks
that
water
is
the
evil
principle
next
to
him
is
eavesdrop
a
man
who
by
dint
of
a
certain
something
like
smartness
has
got
into
good
society
he
is
a
sort
of
bookseller
s
tool
and
coins
all
his
acquaintance
in
reminiscences
and
sketches
of
character
i
am
very
shy
of
him
for
fear
he
should
print
me
he
print
you
in
your
own
likeness
which
is
that
of
an
angel
you
need
not
fear
him
if
he
print
you
in
any

i
will
cut
his
throat

to
him
is
henbane
the
toxicologist
i
think
he
calls
himself
he
has
passed
half
his

in

antidotes

he
did

was
to
kill
the
cat

while

crying
over
her

brought
her
to

again
i
am
more
shy
of
him
than
the
other
are
two
very
dangerous
fellows
and
i
shall
take
care
to
keep
them
both
at
a
respectful
distance
let
us
hope
that
eavesdrop
will
sketch
off
henbane
and
that
henbane
will
poison
him
for
his
trouble
next
to
him
sits
mac
quedy
the
modern
athenian
who
lays
down
the
law
about
everything
and
therefore
may
be
taken
to
understand
everything
he
turns
all
the
affairs
of
this
world
into
questions
of
buying
and
selling
he
is
the
spirit
of
the
frozen
ocean
to
everything
like
romance
and
sentiment
he
condenses
their
volume
of
steam
into
a
drop
of
cold
water
in
a
moment
he
has
satisfied
me
that
i
am
a
commodity
in
the
market
and
that
i
ought
to
set
myself
at
a
high
price
so
you
see
he
who
would
have
me
must
bid
for
me
shall
discuss
that
point
with
mac
quedy
a
word
for
your
life
our
flirtation
is
our
own
secret
let
it
remain
so
clarinda
is
that
all
that
the
most
don
t
be
rhapsodical
here
next
to
mac
quedy
is
skionar
a
sort
of
poetical
philosopher
a
curious
compound
of
the
intense
and
the
mystical
he
abominates
all
the
ideas
of
mac
quedy
and
settles
everything
by
sentiment
and
intuition
i
say
he
is
the
wiser
man
are
two
oddities
but
a
little
of
them
is
amusing
and
i
like
to
hear
them
dispute
so
you
see
i
am
in
training
for
a
philosopher
myself
philosophy
for
heaven
s
sake
but
the
philosophy
of
mac
quedy
they
say
that
even
skionar
though
he
is
a
great
dreamer
always
dreams
with
his
eyes
open
or
with
one
eye
at
any
rate
which
is
an
eye
to
his
gain
but
i
believe
that
in
this
respect
the
poor
man
has
got
an
ill
name
by
keeping
bad
company
he
has
two
dear
friends
wilful
wontsee
and
rumblesack
shantsee
poets
of
some
note
who
used
to
see
visions
of
utopia
and
pure
republics
beyond
the
western
deep
but
finding
that
these
el
dorados
brought
them
no
revenue
they
turned
their
faculty
into
the
more
profitable
channel
of
espying
all
sorts
of
virtues
in
the
high
and
the
mighty
who
were
able
and
willing
to
pay
for
the
discovery
do
not
fancy
these
to
skionar
sits
chainmail
a
young
gentleman
as
you
see
with
very
antiquated
tastes
he
is
fond
of
old
poetry
and
is
something
of
a
poet
himself
he
is
deep
in
monkish
literature
and
holds
that
the
best
state
of
society
was
that
of
the
twelfth
century
when
nothing
was
going
forward
but
fighting
feasting
and
praying
which
he
says
are
the
three
great
purposes
for
which
man
was
made
he
laments
bitterly
over
the
inventions
of
gunpowder
steam
and
gas
which
he
says
have
ruined
the
world
he
lives
within
two
or
three
miles
and
has
a
large
hall
adorned
with
rusty
pikes
shields
helmets
swords
and
tattered
banners
and
furnished
with
chairs
and
two
long
old
oak
tables
where
he
dines
with
all
his
household
after
the
fashion
of
his
favourite
age
he
wants
us
all
to
dine
with
him
and
i
believe
we
shall
go
will
be
something
new
at
any
rate
to
him
is
toogood
the
who
will
have
neither
fighting
nor
praying
but
wants
to
parcel
out
the
world
into
squares
like
a
with
a
community
on
each
raising
everything
for
one
another
with
a
great
to
serve
them
in
common
for
tailor
and
hosier
kitchen
and
cook
is
the
strangest
of
the
set
so
far
brings
us
to
the
bottom
of
the
table
where
sits
my
humble
servant
crotchet
the
younger
i
ought
not
to
describe
him
entreat
you
do
i
really
have
very
little
to
say
in
his
favour
do
not
wish
to
hear
anything
in
his
favour
and
i
rejoice
to
hear
you
say
so
not
flatter
yourself
if
i
take
him
it
will
be
to
please
my
father
and
to
have
a
town
and
country
house
and
plenty
of
servants
and
a
carriage
and
an
and
make
some
of
my
acquaintance
who
have
married
for
love
or
for
rank
or
for
anything
but
money
die
for
envy
of
my
jewels
you
do
not
think
i
would
take
him
for
himself
why
he
is
very
smooth
and
spruce
as
far
as
his
dress
goes
but
as
to
his
face
he
looks
as
if
he
had
tumbled
headlong
into
a
volcano
and
been
thrown
up
again
among
the
cinders
can
not
believe
that
speaking
thus
of
him
you
mean
to
take
him
at
all
i
am
out
of
my
teens
i
have
been
very
much
in
love
but
now
i
am
come
to
years
of
discretion
and
must
think
like
other
people
of
settling
myself
advantageously
he
was
in
love
with
a
banker
s
daughter
and
cast
her
off
at
her
father
s
bankruptcy
and
the
poor
girl
has
gone
to
hide
herself
in
some
wild
place
must
have
a
strange
taste
if
she
pines
for
the
loss
of
him
say
he
was
till
his
bubble
schemes
as
they
call
them
stamped
him
with
the
physiognomy
of
a
desperate
gambler
i
suspect
he
has
still
a
penchant
towards
his
first
flame
if
he
takes
me
it
will
be
for
my
rank
and
connection
and
the
second
seat
of
the
borough
of
rogueingrain
so
we
shall
meet
on
equal
terms
and
shall
enjoy
all
the
blessedness
of
expecting
nothing
from
each
other
can
expect
no
security
with
such
an
adventurer
shall
have
the
security
of
a
good
settlement
and
then
if
al
be
his
destiny
he
may
go
you
know
by
himself
he
is
almost
always
dreaming
and
it
is
very
likely
that
some
great
reverse
is
in
store
for
him
but
that
will
not
concern
me
you
perceive
torture
me
clarinda
with
the
bare
possibility
here
is
music
to
soothe
your
troubled
spirit
next
to
him
on
this
side
sits
the
dilettante
composer
trillo
they
say
his
name
was
o
trill
and
he
has
taken
the
o
from
the
beginning
and
put
it
at
the
end
i
do
not
know
how
this
may
be
he
plays
well
on
the
violoncello
and
better
on
the
piano
sings
agreeably
has
a
talent
at
versemaking
and
improvises
a
song
with
some
felicity
he
is
very
agreeable
company
in
the
evening
with
his
instruments
and
he
maintains
that
the
sole
end
of
all
enlightened
society
is
to
get
up
a
good
opera
and
laments
that
wealth
genius
and
energy
are
squandered
upon
other
pursuits
to
the
neglect
of
this
one
great
matter
is
a
very
pleasant
fancy
at
any
rate
assure
you
he
has
a
great
deal
to
say
for
it
well
next
to
him
again
is
morbific
who
has
been
all
over
the
world
to
prove
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
contagion
and
has
inoculated
himself
with
plague
yellow
fever
and
every
variety
of
pestilence
and
is
still
alive
to
tell
the
story
i
am
very
shy
of
him
too
for
i
look
on
him
as
a
walking
phial
of
wrath
corked
full
of
all
infections
and
not
to
be
touched
without
extreme
hazard
is
the
strangest
fellow
of
all
to
him
sits
philpot
the
geographer
who
thinks
of
nothing
but
the
heads
and
tails
of
rivers
and
lays
down
the
streams
of
terra
incognita
as
accurately
as
if
he
had
been
there
he
is
a
person
of
pleasant
fancy
and
makes
a
sort
of
fairy
land
of
every
country
he
touches
from
the
frozen
ocean
to
the
deserts
of
sahara
does
he
settle
matters
with
firedamp
see
firedamp
has
got
as
far
as
possible
out
of
his
way
next
to
him
is
sir
simon
steeltrap
of
steeltrap
lodge
member
for
justice
of
peace
for
the
county
and
lord
of
the
united
manors
of
a
great
preserver
of
game
and
public
morals
by
administering
the
laws
which
he
assists
in
making
he
disposes
at
his
pleasure
of
the
land
and
its
live
stock
including
all
the
varieties
with
and
without
feathers
in
a
circumference
of
several
miles
round
steeltrap

he
has
enclosed
commons
and

abolished

taken
the

into
his
own
park
out
of
pure
regard
to
the
sanctity
of

shut
up
footpaths
and
alehouses
all
but
those
which
belong
to
his
electioneering
friend
quassia
the
brewer
put
down
fairs
and
fiddlers
committed
many
poachers
shot
a
few
convicted
of
the
peasantry
suspected
the
rest
and
passed
nearly
the
whole
of
them
through
a
wholesome
course
of
prison
discipline
which
has
finished
their
education
at
the
expense
of
the
county
is
somewhat
out
of
his
element
here
among
such
a
diversity
of
opinions
he
will
hear
some
he
will
not
like
was
rather
in
crotchet
to
invite
him
but
the
art
of
assorting
company
is
above
these
they
invite
a
certain
number
of
persons
without
considering
how
they
harmonise
with
each
other
between
sir
simon
and
you
is
the
reverend
doctor
folliott
he
is
said
to
be
an
excellent
scholar
and
is
fonder
of
books
than
the
majority
of
his
cloth
he
is
very
fond
also
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
he
is
of
an
admirable
temper
and
says
rude
things
in
a
pleasant
manner
that
nobody
can
take
offence
with
and
next
to
him
again
is
one
captain
fitzchrome
who
is
very
much
in
love
with
a
certain
person
that
does
not
mean
to
have
anything
to
say
to
him
because
she
can
better
her
fortune
by
taking
somebody
else
next
to
him
again
is
the
beautiful
the
accomplished
the
witty
the
fascinating
the
tormenting
lady
clarinda
who
traduces
herself
to
the
said
captain
by
assertions
which
it
would
drive
him
crazy
to
believe
will
show
sir
and
now
we
have
gone
the
round
of
the
table
i
must
say
though
i
know
you
had
always
a
turn
for
sketching
characters
you
surprise
me
by
your
observation
and
especially
by
your
attention
to
opinions
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
i
am
writing
a
novel
novel
a
novel
and
i
shall
get
a
little
finery
by
it
trinkets
and
which
i
can
not
get
from
papa
you
must
know
i
have
been
reading
several
fashionable
novels
the
fashionable
this
and
the
fashionable
that
and
i
thought
to
myself
why
i
can
do
better
than
any
of
these
myself
so
i
wrote
a
chapter
or
two
and
sent
them
as
a
specimen
to
puffall
the
telling
him
they
were
to
be
a
part
of
the
fashionable
something
or
other
and
he
offered
me
i
will
not
say
how
much
to
finish
it
in
three
volumes
and
let
him
pay
all
the
newspapers
for
recommending
it
as
the
work
of
a
lady
of
quality
who
had
made
very
free
with
the
characters
of
her
acquaintance
you
have
not
done
so
no
i
leave
that
to
eavesdrop
but
puffall
made
it
a
condition
that
i
should
let
him
say
so
strange
recommendation
nothing
else
will
do
and
it
seems
you
may
give
yourself
any
character
you
like
and
the
newspapers
will
print
it
as
if
it
came
from
themselves
i
have
commended
you
to
three
of
our
friends
here
as
an
economist
a
transcendentalist
and
a
classical
scholar
and
if
you
wish
to
be
renowned
through
the
world
for
these
or
any
other
accomplishments
the
newspapers
will
confirm
you
in
their
possession
for
a
piece
the
praise
of
such
gentry
must
be
a
feather
in
any
one
s
cap
you
will
see
some
morning
that
my
novel
is
the
most
popular
production
of
the
this
is
puffall
s
favourite
phrase
he
makes
the
newspapers
say
it
of
everything
he
publishes
but
the
day
you
know
is
a
very
convenient
phrase
it
allows
of
three
hundred
and
most
popular
productions
in
a
year
and
in
one
more
chapter
vi
theories
but
when
they
came
to
shape
the
model
not
one
could
fit
the
other
s
meanwhile
the
last
course
and
the
dessert
passed
by
when
the
ladies
had
withdrawn
young
crotchet
addressed
the
company
there
is
one
point
in
which
philosophers
of
all
classes
seem
to
be
agreed
that
they
only
want
money
to
regenerate
the
world
mac
doubt
of
it
nothing
is
so
easy
as
to
lay
down
the
outlines
of
perfect
society
there
wants
nothing
but
money
to
set
it
going
i
will
explain
myself
clearly
and
fully
by
reading
a
paper
producing
a
large
scroll
in
the
infancy
of
rev
mac
quedy
how
is
it
that
all
gentlemen
of
your
nation
begin
everything
they
write
with
the
infancy
of
society
mac
sir
it
is
the
simplest
way
to
begin
at
the
beginning
in
the
infancy
of
society
when
government
was
invented
to
save
a
percentage
say
two
and
a
half
per
rev
will
not
say
any
such
thing
mac
say
any
percentage
you
please
rev
will
not
say
any
percentage
at
all
mac
on
the
principle
of
the
division
of
rev
was
invented
to
spend
a
percentage
mac
save
a
percentage
rev
sir
to
spend
a
percentage
and
a
good
deal
more
than
two
and
a
half
percent
two
hundred
and
fifty
per
cent
that
is
intelligible
mac
in
the
infancy
of
mind
the
infancy
of
society
the
question
is
of
society
in
its
maturity
here
is
what
it
should
be
producing
a
paper
i
have
laid
it
down
in
a
diagram
we
proceed
to
the
question
of
government
we
must
nicely
discriminate
the
boundaries
of
sense
understanding
and
reason
sense
is
a
are
proceeding
too
fast
money
being
all
that
is
wanted
to
regenerate
society
i
will
put
into
the
hands
of
this
company
a
large
sum
for
the
purpose
now
let
us
see
how
to
dispose
of
it
mac
will
begin
by
taking
a
in
london
where
we
will
dine
together
once
a
week
to
deliberate
rev
the
money
is
to
go
in
deliberative
dinners
you
may
set
me
down
for
a
committee
man
and
honorary
caterer
mac
you
must
all
learn
political
economy
which
i
will
teach
you
very
compendiously
in
lectures
over
the
bottle
rev
hate
lectures
over
the
bottle
but
pray
sir
what
is
political
economy
mac
economy
is
to
the
state
what
domestic
economy
is
to
the
family
rev
such
thing
sir
in
the
family
there
is
a
who
regulates
the
distribution
and
takes
care
that
there
shall
be
no
such
thing
in
the
household
as
one
dying
of
hunger
while
another
dies
of
surfeit
in
the
state
it
is
all
hunger
at
one
end
and
all
surfeit
at
the
other
matchless
claret
crotchet
of
fifteen
doctor
mac
family
consumes
and
so
does
the
state
rev
air
yes
but
the
mode
the
proportions
there
is
the
essential
difference
between
the
state
and
the
family
sir
i
hate
false
analogies
mac
sir
the
analogy
is
not
essential
distribution
will
come
under
its
proper
head
rev
where
it
will
the
distribution
of
the
state
is
in
no
respect
analogous
to
the
distribution
of
the
family
the
sir
the
mac
sir
let
that
pass
the
family
consumes
and
in
order
to
consume
it
must
have
supply
rev
sir
adam
and
eve
knew
that
when
they
delved
and
span
mac
true
sir
reproducing
his
scroll
in
the
infancy
of
reverend
gentleman
has
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
it
is
the
distribution
that
must
be
looked
to
it
is
the
that
is
wanting
in
the
state
now
here
i
have
provided
him
reproducing
his
diagram
the
money
sir
to
building
and
endowing
an
opera
house
where
the
ancient
altar
of
bacchus
may
flourish
and
justice
may
be
done
to
sublime
compositions
producing
a
part
of
a
manuscript
opera
sir
build
for
transcendental
oracles
to
teach
the
world
how
to
see
through
a
glass
darkly
producing
a
scroll
through
an
brightly
rev
through
a
full
of
claret
then
you
see
both
darkly
and
brightly
but
gentlemen
if
you
are
all
in
the
humour
for
reading
papers
i
will
read
you
the
first
half
of
my
next
sunday
s
sermon
producing
a
paper
sermon
no
sermon
rev
i
move
that
our
respective
papers
be
committed
to
our
respective
pockets
mac
economy
is
divided
into
two
great
branches
production
and
consumption
rev
sir
there
are
two
great
classes
of
men
those
who
produce
much

off
from

as

was
left
to
entertain
himself
with
his
own
meditations
till
the
reverend
doctor
folliott
tore
himself
from
mac
quedy
and
proceeded
to
expostulate
with
crotchet
on
a
delicate
topic
there
was
an
italian
painter
who
obtained
the
name
of
by
the
superinduction
of
inexpressibles
on
the
naked
apollos
and
bacchuses
of
his
betters
the
fame
of
this
worthy
remained
one
and
indivisible
till
a
set
of
heads
which
had
been
by
a
too
common
mistake
of
nature
s
journeymen
stuck
upon
magisterial
shoulders
as
the
corinthian
capitals
of
fair
round
bellies
with
fat
capon
lined
but
which
nature
herself
had
intended
for
the
noddles
of
porcelain
mandarins
promulgated
simultaneously
from
the
east
and
the
west
of
london
an
order
that
no
venus
should
appear
in
the
streets
without
petticoats
crotchet
on
reading
this
order
in
the
evening
paper
which
by
the
postman
s
early
arrival
was
always
laid
on
his
determined
to
fill
his
house
with
venuses
of
all
sizes
and
kinds
in
pursuance
of
this
resolution
came
packages
by
containing
an
infinite
variety
of
venuses
there
were
the
medicean
venus
and
the
bathing
venus
the
uranian
venus
and
the
pandemian
venus
the
crouching
venus
and
the
sleeping
venus
the
venus
rising
from
the
sea
the
venus
with
the
apple
of
paris
and
the
venus
with
the
armour
of
mars
the
reverend
doctor
folliott
had
been
very
much
astonished
at
this
unexpected
display
disposed
as
he
was
to
hold
that
whatever
had
been
in
greece
was
right
he
was
more
than
doubtful
of
the
propriety
of
throwing
open
the
classical
to
the
illiterate
profane
whether
in
his
interior
mind
he
was
at
all
influenced
either
by
the
consideration
that
it
would
be
for
the
credit
of
his
cloth
with
some
of
his
neighbours
to
be
able
to
say
that
he
had
expostulated
or
by
curiosity
to
try
what
sort
of
defence
his
friend
who
knew
the
classics
only
by
translations
and
whose
reason
was
always
a
little
ahead
of
his
knowledge
would
make
for
his
somewhat
ostentatious
display
of
liberality
in
matters
of
taste
is
a
question
on
which
the
learned
may
differ
but
after
having
duly
deliberated
on
two
casts
of
the
uranian
and
pandemian
venus
in
niches
on
each
side
of
the
chimney
and
on
three
alabaster
figures
in
glass
cases
on
the
mantelpiece
he
proceeded
peirastically
to
open
his
fire
rev
little
alabaster
figures
on
the
mantelpiece
crotchet
and
those
large
figures
in
the
i
take
the
liberty
to
ask
you
what
they
are
intended
to
represent
sir
nothing
more
sir
just
venus
rev
i
ask
you
sir
why
they
are
there
be
looked
at
sir
just
to
be
looked
at
the
reasons
for
most
things
in
a
gentleman
s
house
being
in
it
at
all
from
the
paper
on
the
walls
and
the
drapery
of
the
curtains
even
to
the
books
in
the
library
of
which
the
most
essential
part
is
the
appearance
of
the
back
rev
true
sir
as
great
philosophers
hold
that
the
of
things
is
so
a
gentleman
s
furniture
exists
to
be
looked
at
nevertheless
sir
there
are
some
things
more
fit
to
be
looked
at
than
others
for
instance
there
is
nothing
more
fit
to
be
looked
at
than
the
outside
of
a
book
it
is
as
i
may
say
from
repeated
experience
a
pure
and
unmixed
pleasure
to
have
a
goodly
volume
lying
before
you
and
to
know
that
you
may
open
it
if
you
please
and
need
not
open
it
unless
you
please
it
is
a
resource
against
if
should
come
upon
you
to
have
the
resource
and
not
to
feel
the
to
enjoy
your
bottle
in
the
present
and
your
book
in
the
indefinite
future
is
a
delightful
condition
of
human
existence
there
is
no
place
in
which
a
man
can
move
or
sit
in
which
the
outside
of
a
book
can
be
otherwise
than
an
innocent
and
becoming
spectacle
touching
this
matter
there
can
not
i
think
be
two
opinions
but
with
respect
to
your
venuses
there
can
be
and
indeed
there
are
two
very
distinct
opinions
now
sir
that
little
figure
in
the
centre
of
the
a
grave
crotchet
with
a
fair
nubile
daughter
whose
eyes
are
like
the
of
would
ask
you
if
you
hold
that
figure
to
be
altogether
delicate
sleeping
venus
sir
nothing
can
be
more
delicate
than
the
entire
contour
of
the
figure
the
flow
of
the
hair
on
the
shoulders
and
neck
the
form
of
the
feet
and
fingers
it
is
altogether
a
most
delicate
morsel
rev
in
that
sense
perhaps
it
is
as
delicate
as
whitebait
in
july
but
the
attitude
sir
the
attitude
can
be
more
natural
sir
rev
is
the
very
thing
sir
it
is
too
natural
too
natural
sir
it
lies
for
all
the
world
i
make
no
doubt
the
pious
cheesemonger
who
recently
broke
its
plaster
facsimile
over
the
head
of
the
itinerant
vendor
was
struck
by
a
certain
similitude
to
the
position
of
his
own
sleeping
beauty
and
felt
his
noble
wrath
thereby
justly
aroused
likely
sir
in
my
opinion
the
cheesemonger
was
a
fool
and
the
justice
who
sided
with
him
was
a
greater
rev
sir
is
a
harsh
term
call
not
thy
brother
a
fool
neither
the
cheesemonger
nor
the
justice
is
a
brother
of
mine
rev
we
are
all
brethren
sir
as
the
hangman
is
of
the
thief
the
squire
of
the
poacher
the
judge
of
the
libeller
the
lawyer
of
his
client
the
statesman
of
his
colleague
the
of
the
the
of
the
negro
as
these
are
brethren
so
am
i
and
the
worthies
in
question
rev
be
sure
sir
in
these
instances
and
in
many
others
the
term
brother
must
be
taken
in
its
utmost
latitude
of
interpretation
we
are
all
brothers
nevertheless
but
to
return
to
the
point
now
these
two
large
figures
one
with
drapery
on
the
lower
half
of
the
body
and
the
other
with
no
drapery
at
all
upon
my
word
sir
it
matters
not
what
godfathers
and
godmothers
may
have
promised
and
vowed
for
the
children
of
this
world
touching
the
devil
and
other
things
to
be
renounced
if
such
figures
as
those
are
to
be
put
before
their
eyes
the
naked
figure
is
the
pandemian
venus
and
the
figure
is
the
uranian
venus
and
i
say
sir
that
figure
realises
the
finest
imaginings
of
plato
and
is
the
personification
of
the
most
refined
and
exalted
feeling
of
which
the
human
mind
is
susceptible
the
love
of
pure
ideal
intellectual
beauty
rev
am
aware
sir
that
plato
in
his
symposium
discourseth
very
eloquently
touching
the
uranian
and
pandemian
venus
but
you
must
remember
that
in
our
universities
plato
is
held
to
be
little
better
than
a
misleader
of
youth
and
they
have
shown
their
contempt
for
him
not
only
by
never
reading
him
a
mode
of
contempt
in
which
they
deal
very
largely
but
even
by
never
printing
a
complete
edition
of
him
although
they
have
printed
many
ancient
books
which
nobody
suspects
to
have
been
ever
read
on
the
spot
except
by
a
person
attached
to
the
press
who
is
therefore
emphatically
called
the
sir
rev
sir
to
the
reader
aforesaid
supposing
either
of
our
universities
to
have
printed
an
edition
of
plato
or
to
any
one
else
who
can
be
supposed
to
have
read
plato
or
indeed
to
be
ever
likely
to
do
so
i
would
very
willingly
show
these
figures
because
to
such
they
would
i
grant
you
be
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
poetical
and
philosophical
ideas
but
to
the
multitude
the
gross
carnal
multitude
they
are
but
two
beautiful
women
one
half
undressed
and
the
other
quite
so
sir
let
the
multitude
look
upon
them
and
learn
modesty
rev
must
say
that
if
i
wished
my
footman
to
learn
modesty
i
should
not
dream
of
sending
him
to
school
to
a
naked
venus
ancient
sculpture
is
the
true
school
of
modesty
but
where
the
greeks
had
modesty
we
have
cant
where
they
had
poetry
we
have
cant
where
they
had
patriotism
we
have
cant
where
they
had
anything
that
exalts
delights
or
adorns
humanity
we
have
nothing
but
cant
cant
cant
and
sir
to
show
my
contempt
for
cant
in
all
its
shapes
i
have
adorned
my
house
with
the
greek
venus
in
all
her
shapes
and
am
ready
to
fight
her
battle
against
all
the
societies
that
ever
were
instituted
for
the
suppression
of
truth
and
beauty
rev
dear
sir
i
am
afraid
you
are
growing
warm
pray
be
cool
nothing
contributes
so
much
to
good
digestion
as
to
be
perfectly
cool
after
dinner
the
lacedæmonian
virgins
wrestled
naked
with
young
men
and
they
grew
up
as
the
wise
lycurgus
had
foreseen
into
the
most
modest
of
women
and
the
most
exemplary
of
wives
and
mothers
rev
likely
sir
but
the
athenian
virgins
did
no
such
thing
and
they
grew
up
into
wives
who
stayed
at
at
home
sir
and
looked
after
their
husbands
dinner
sir
you
will
please
to
observe
what
was
the
consequence
of
that
sir
that
they
were
such
very
insipid
persons
that
the
husband
would
not
go
home
to
eat
his
dinner
but
preferred
the
company
of
some
aspasia
or
lais
rev
very
different
persons
sir
give
me
leave
to
remark
likely
sir
but
both
too
good
to
be
married
in
athens
rev
lais
was
a
corinthian
s
vengeance
sir
some
aspasia
and
any
other
athenian
name
of
the
same
sort
of
person
you
rev
do
not
like
the
sort
of
person
at
all
the
sort
of
person
i
like
as
i
have
already
implied
is
a
modest
woman
who
stays
at
home
and
looks
after
her
husband
s
dinner
sir
that
was
not
the
taste
of
the
athenians
they
preferred
the
society
of
women
who
would
not
have
made
any
scruple
about
sitting
as
models
to
praxiteles
as
you
know
sir
very
modest
women
in
italy
did
to
canova
one
of
whom
an
italian
countess
being
asked
by
an
english
lady
how
she
could
bear
it
answered
very
well
there
was
a
good
fire
in
the
rev
the
english
lady
should
have
asked
how
the
italian
lady
s
husband
could
bear
it
the
phials
of
my
wrath
would
overflow
if
poor
dear
folliott
sir
in
return
for
your
story
i
will
tell
you
a
story
of
my
ancestor
gilbert
folliott
the
devil
haunted
him
as
he
did
saint
francis
in
the
likeness
of
a
beautiful
damsel
but
all
he
could
get
from
the
exemplary
gilbert
was
an
admonition
to
wear
a
stomacher
and
longer
petticoats
your
story
makes
for
my
side
of
the
question
it
proves
that
the
devil
in
the
likeness
of
a
fair
damsel
with
short
petticoats
and
no
stomacher
was
almost
too
much
for
gilbert
folliott
the
force
of
the
spell
was
in
the
drapery
rev
my
soul
sir
me
leave
sir

was

was
he

the
sublime
philosopher
the
father
of

of
all
the
encyclopædias

if
you
please
albeit
this
sleeping
venus
is
not
an
antique
sir
the
greeks
why
do
we
call
the
elgin
marbles
inestimable
simply
because
they
are
true
to
nature
and
why
are
they
so
superior
in
that
point
to
all
modern
works
with
all
our
greater
knowledge
of
anatomy
why
sir
but
because
the
greeks
having
no
cant
had
better
opportunities
of
studying
models
rev
i
deny
our
greater
knowledge
of
anatomy

i
shall
take

throwing
himself
back
into

chair

flinging
up
his
heels
with
the
premeditated
design
of
giving
emphasis
to
his
exclamation

by
miscalculating
his
impetus
he
overbalanced
his
chair
and
laid
himself
on

the

as
in

obscura
over

the
image
of
eavesdrop
with
a
printed
sketch
of
the
reverend
doctor
presented
itself
before
him
and
he
began
mechanically
to
flourish
his
bamboo
the
movement
was
prompted
by
his
good
genius
for
the
uplifted
bamboo
received
the
blow
of
a
ponderous
cudgel
which
was
intended
for
his
head
the
reverend
gentleman
recoiled
two
or
three
paces
and
saw
before
him
a
couple
of
ruffians
who
were
preparing
to
renew
the
attack
but
whom
with
two
swings
of
his
bamboo
he
laid
with
cracked
sconces
on
the
earth
where
he
proceeded
to
deal
with
them
like
corn
beneath
the
flail
of
the

one
of
them
drew
a
pistol
which
went
off
in
the
very
act
of
being
struck
aside
by
the
bamboo
and
lodged
a
bullet
in
the
brain
of

was

on

went
off

preliminaries

out

what
in

of
all
that
is

can
those
fellows
mean
they
have
come
here
in

to
make
a

about
a

which
after
all
they
leave
as
it

who
pays
them
for

trouble
and
how
public
pay
for
it

it
is
a
job
of
the
learned
friend
whom
you
admire
so
much
it
makes
away
with

money
in

and
private
money
in

and
does
no
particle
of
good
to
any

is
just
the
sort
of
public

to
be
looked
for

the

friend
he
is
the
evil
genius
of
everything
that
falls

walked
off

said
the

this
is
still
a
seat
of
learning
on

may

what
for

what
for

what
for

worth

this
was
a
seat
of
learning
in
the
days
of
friar
bacon
but
the
friar
is
gone
and
his
learning
with
him
nothing
of
him
is
left
but
the
immortal
nose
which
when
his
brazen

had
tumbled
to

crying

was
the
only
palpable
fragment

i
do
denounce

shall
set
you
right
on
this
point
we
do
nothing
without
motives
if

get
nothing
but
honour
and
very
little
of
that
and
if
the
good
things
of
this
world
which
ought
to
be
the
rewards
of
learning
become
the
mere
gifts
of
patronage
you
must
not
wonder
if
in
the
finishing
of
education
the
science
which
takes
precedence
of
all
others
should
be
the
science
of
currying
favour
rev
true
sir
education
is
well
finished
for
all
worldly
purposes
when
the
head
is
brought
into

i
am
accustomed
to
bring

white
napkin
wrapped
round

trundles
along
the
high
road
of
preferment
so
trimly
as
a

clean

without

atque
the
perfection
of
the

lies
in
the
bias
which
keeps

trundling
in
the

there
is
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
the

being

but
a
tiresome
thing
in
itself
it
becomes
more
agreeable
the
more
romance
is
mixed
up
with
it
the
great
enchanter
has
made
me
learn
many
things
which
i
should
never
have
dreamed
of
studying
if
they
had
not
come
to
me
in
the
form
of
amusement
rev
enchanter
is
that
there
are
two
enchanters
he
of
the
north
and
he
of
the
south
rev
there
is
another
enchanter
but
i
mean
the
great
enchanter
of
covent
garden
he
who
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
has
produced
two
pantomimes
a
year
to
the
delight
of
children
of
all
ages
including
myself
at
all
ages
that
is
the
enchanter
for
me
i
am
for
the
pantomimes
all
the
northern
enchanter
s
romances
put
together
would
not
furnish
materials
for
half
the
southern
enchanter
s
pantomimes
you
do
not
class
literature
with
pantomime
rev
these
cases
i
do
they
are
both
one
with
a
slight
difference
the
one
is
the
literature
of
pantomime
the
other
is
the
pantomime
of
literature
there
is
the
same
variety
of
character
the
same
diversity
of
story
the
same
copiousness
of
incident
the
same
research
into
costume
the
same
display
of
heraldry
falconry
minstrelsy
scenery
monkery
witchery
devilry
robbery
poachery
piracy
fishery
demonology
architecture
fortification
castrametation
navigation
the
same
running
base
of
love
and
battle
the
main
difference
is
that
the
one
set
of
amusing
fictions
is
told
in
music
and
action
the
other
in
all
the
worst
dialects
of
the
english
language
as
to
any
sentence
worth
remembering
any
moral
or
political
truth
anything
having
a
tendency
however
remote

make

wiser

better

make
them

make
them

thinking
they
are
both
precisely
alike
amusing
however
rev
amusing
very
amusing
quarrel
with
the
northern
enchanter
is
that
he
has
grossly
misrepresented
the
twelfth
century
rev
has
misrepresented
everything
or
he
would
not
have
been
very
amusing

truth
is

dull
matter

sit
all
day
on

bank
without
catching
a
gudgeon

how
do
you
mean
that
he
has
misrepresented
the
twelfth
century
by
exhibiting
some
of
its
knights
and
ladies
in
the
colours
of
refinement
and
virtue
seeing
that
they
were
all
no
better
than
ruffians
and
something
else
that
shall
be
nameless
no
means
by
depicting
them
as
much
worse
than
they
were
not
as
you
suppose
much
better
no
one
would
infer
from
his
pictures
that
theirs
was
a
much
better
state
of
society
than
this
which
we
live
in
mac
nor
was
it
it
was
a
period
of
brutality
ignorance
fanaticism
and
tyranny
when
the
land
was
covered
with
castles
and
every
castle
contained
a
gang
of
banditti
headed
by
a
titled
robber
who
levied
contributions
with
fire
and
sword
plundering
torturing
ravishing
burying
his
captives
in
loathsome
dungeons
and
broiling
them
on
gridirons
to
force
from
them
the
surrender
of
every
particle
of
treasure
which
he
suspected
them
of
possessing
and
fighting
every
now
and
then
with
the
neighbouring
lords
his
conterminal
bandits
for
the
right
of
marauding
on
the
boundaries

was
the
twelfth
century

depicted
by
all
contemporary

and
poets

the
evidence

you
will
find
more

than

best
thing
ever
done

there
are
lords
of

you
must
remember
too
that
these
lords
were
petty
princes
and
made
war
on
each
other
as
legitimately
as
the
heads
of
larger
communities
did
or
do
for
their
system
of
revenue
it
was
to
be
sure
more
rough
and
summary
than
that
which
has
succeeded
it
but
it
was
certainly
less
searching
and
less
productive
and
as
to
the
people
i
content
myself
with
these
great
points
that
every
man
was
armed
every
man
was
a
good
archer
every
man
could
and
would
fight
effectively
with
sword
or
pike
or
even
with
oaken
cudgel
no
man
would
live
quietly
without
beef
and
ale
if
he
had
them
not
he
fought
till
he
either
got
them
or
was
put
out
of
condition
to
want
them
they
were
not
and
could
not
be
subjected
to
that
powerful
pressure
of
all
the
other
classes
of
society
combined
by
gunpowder
steam
and
which
has
brought
them
to
that
dismal
degradation
in
which
we
see
them
now
and
there
are
the
people
of
the
twelfth
century
mac
to
your
king
the
enchanter
has
done
him
ample
justice
even
in
your
own
view
as
to
your
lords
and
their
ladies
he
has
drawn
them
too
favourably
given
them
too
many
of
the
false
colours
of
chivalry
thrown
too
attractive
a
light
on
their
abominable
doings
as
to
the
people
he
keeps
them
so
much
in
the
background
that
he
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
represented
them
at
all
much
less
misrepresented
them
which
indeed
he
could
scarcely
do
seeing
that
by
your
own
showing
they
were
all
thieves
ready
to
knock
down
any
man
for
what
they
could
not
come
by
honestly
sir
they
could
come
honestly
by
beef
and
ale
while
they
were
left
to
their
simple
industry
when
oppression
interfered
with
them
in
that
then
they
stood
on
the
defensive
and
fought
for
what
they
were
not
permitted
to
come
by
quietly
mac
being
aggrieved
by
knocks
down
do
you
call
that
standing
on
the
defensive
depends
on
who
or
what
is
rev
you
will
never
settle
this
controversy
till
you
have
first
settled
what
is
good
for
man
in
this
world
the
great
question
which
has
puzzled
all
philosophers
if
the
enchanter
has
represented
the
twelfth
century
too
brightly
for
one
and
too
darkly
for
the
other
of
you
i
should
say
as
an
impartial
man
he
has
represented
it
fairly
my
quarrel
with
him
is
that
his
works
contain
nothing
worth
quoting
and
a
book
that
furnishes
no
quotations
is
no
is
a
plaything
there
is
no
question
about
the
amusement
of
multitudes
but
if
he
who
amuses
us
most
is
to
be

a
subject
for

it
is
a
question
worth
asking
mac
quedy
whether
the
religious
spirit
which
reared
these
edifices
and
connected
with
them
everywhere
an
asylum
for
misfortune
and
a
provision
for
poverty
was
not
better
than
the
commercial
spirit
which
has
turned
all
the
business
of
modern
life
into
schemes
of
profit
and
processes
of
fraud
and
extortion
i
do
not
see
in
all
your
boasted
improvements
any
compensation
for
the
religious
charity
of
the
twelfth

i
do
not
see
any
compensation
for
that
kindly
feeling
which
within
their
own
little
communities
bound
the
several
classes
of
society
together
while
full
scope
was
left
for
the
development
of
natural
character
wherein
individuals
differed
as
conspicuously
as
in
costume
now
we
all
wear
one
conventional
dress
one
conventional
face
we
have
no
bond
of
union
but
pecuniary
interest
we
talk
anything
that
comes
uppermost
for
talking
s
sake
and
without
expecting
to
be
believed
we
have
no
nature
no
simplicity
no
picturesqueness
everything
about
us
is
as
artificial
and
as
complicated
as
our
our
poetry
is
a
kaleidoscope
of
false
imagery
expressing
no
real
feeling
portraying
no
real
existence
i
do
not
see
any
compensation
for
the
poetry
of
the
twelfth
mac
wonder
to
hear
you
chainmail
talking
of
the
religious
charity
of
a
set
of
lazy
monks
and
beggarly
friars
who
were
much
more
occupied
with
taking
than
giving
of
whom
those
who
were
in
earnest
did
nothing
but
make
themselves
and
everybody
about
them
miserable
with
fastings
and
penances
and
other
such
trash
and
those
who
were
not
did
nothing
but
guzzle
and
royster
and
having
no
wives
of
their
own
took
very
unbecoming
liberties
with
those
of
honester
men
and
as
to
your
poetry
of
the
twelfth
century
it
is
not
good
for
much
has
at
any
rate
what
ours
wants
truth
to
nature
and
simplicity
of
diction
the
poetry
which
was
addressed
to
the
people
of
the
dark
ages
pleased
in
proportion
to
the
truth
with
which
it
depicted
familiar
images
and
to
their
natural
connection
with
the
time
and
place
to
which
they
were
assigned
in
the
poetry
of
our
enlightened
times
the
characteristics
of
all
seasons
soils
and
climates
may
be
blended
together
with
much
benefit
to
the
author
s
fame
as
an
original
genius
the
cowslip
of
a
civic
poet
is
always
in
blossom
his
fern
is
always
in
full
feather
he
gathers
the
celandine
the
primrose
the
the
jasmine
and
the
chrysanthemum
all
on
the
same
day
and
from
the
same
spot
his
nightingale
sings
all
the
year
round
his
moon
is
always
full
his
cygnet
is
as
white
as
his
swan
his
cedar
is
as
tremulous
as
his
aspen
and
his
poplar
as
embowering
as
his
beech
thus
all
nature
marches
with
the
march
of
mind
but
among
barbarians
instead
of
mead
and
wine
and
the
best
seat
by

the
reward
of
such
a
genius
would
have
been
to
be
summarily
turned
out
of

meditate
on
the

of
one
of
the
reverend
doctor
s
perorations
you
have
given
the
name
of
a
science
to
what
is
yet
an
imperfect
inquiry
and
the
upshot
of
your
science
is
this
that
you
increase
the
wealth
of
a
nation
by
increasing
in
it
the
quantity
of
things
which
are
produced
by
labour
no
matter
what
they
are
no
matter
how
produced
no
matter
how
distributed
the
greater
the
quantity
of
labour
that
has
gone
to
the
production
of
the
quantity
of
things
in
a
community
the
richer
is
the
community
that
is
your
doctrine
now
i
say
if
this
be
so
riches
are
not
the
object
for
a
community
to
aim
at
i
say
the
nation
is
best
off
in
relation
to
other
nations
which
has
the
greatest
quantity
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
distributed
among
the
greatest
number
of
persons
which
has
the
greatest
number
of
honest
hearts
and
stout
arms
united
in
a
common
interest
willing
to
offend
no
one
but
ready
to
fight
in
defence
of
their
own
community
against
all
the
rest
of
the
world
because
they
have
something
in
it
worth
fighting
for
the
moment
you
admit
that
one
class
of
things
without
any
reference
to
what
they
respectively
cost
is
better
worth
having
than
another
that
a
smaller
commercial
value
with
one
mode
of
distribution
is
better
than
a
greater
commercial
value
with
another
mode
of
distribution
the
whole
of
that
curious
fabric
of
postulates
and
dogmas
which
you
call
the
science
of
political
economy
and
which
i
call
æconomiæ
tumbles
to
toogood
agreed
with
chainmail
against
mac
quedy
that
the
existing
state
of
society
was
worse
than
that
of
the
twelfth
century
but
he
agreed
with
mac
quedy
against
chainmail
that
it
was
in
progress
to
something
much
better
than
which
something
much
better
toogood
and
mac
quedy
attached
two
very
different
meanings
chainmail
fought
with
doctor
folliott
the
battle
of
the
romantic
against
the
classical
in
poetry
and
skionar
contended
with
mac
quedy
for
intuition
and
synthesis
against
analysis
and
induction
in
philosophy
philpot
would
lie
along
for
hours
listening
to
the
gurgling
of
the
water
round
the
prow
and
would
occasionally
edify
the
company
with
speculations
on
the
great
changes
that
would
be
effected
in
the
world
by
the
of
rivers
sketching
the
course
of
a
steamboat
up
and
down
some
mighty
stream
which
civilisation
had
either
never
visited
or
long
since
deserted
the
missouri
and
the
columbia
the
oroonoko
and
the
amazon
the
nile
and
the
niger
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris

oxus
and
the

the
ganges
and
the

under
the
over
canopying
forests
of
the
new
or
by
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
world
through
the
shapeless
mounds
of
babylon
or
the
gigantic
temples
of
thebes
trillo
went
on
with
the
composition
of
his
opera
and
took
the
opinions
of
the
young
ladies
on
every
step
in
its
progress
occasionally
regaling
the
company
with
specimens
and
wondering
at
the
blindness
of
mac
quedy
who
could
not
or
would
not
see
that
an
opera
in
perfection
being
the
union
of
all
the
beautiful
painting
dancing
female
beauty
in
its
most
attractive
aspects
and
in
its
most
becoming
according
to
the
precept
the
most
efficient
instrument
of
civilisation
and
ought
to
take
precedence
of
all
other
pursuits
in
the
minds
of
true
philanthropists
the
reverend
doctor
folliott
on
these
occasions
never
failed
to
say
a
word
or
two
on
trillo
s
side
derived
from
the
practice
of
the
athenians
and
from
the
combination
in
their
theatre
of
all
the
beautiful
arts
in
a
degree
of
perfection
unknown
to
the
modern
world
leaving
lechlade
they
entered
the
canal
that
connects
the
thames
with
the
severn
ascended
by
many
locks
passed
by
a
tunnel
three
miles
long
through
the
bowels
of
sapperton
hill
agreed
unanimously
that
the
greatest
pleasure
derivable
from
visiting
a
cavern
of
any
sort
was
that
of
getting
out
of
it
descended
by
many
locks
again
through
the
valley
of
stroud
into
the
severn
continued
their
navigation
into
the
ellesmere
canal
moored
their
pinnaces
in
the
vale
of
llangollen
by
the
aqueduct
of
pontycysyllty
and
determined
to
pass
some
days
in
inspecting
the
scenery
before
commencing
their
homeward
voyage
the
captain
omitted
no
opportunity
of
pressing
his
suit
on
lady
clarinda
but
could
never
draw
from
her
any
reply
but
the
same
doctrines
of
worldly
wisdom
delivered
in
a
tone
of
mixed
with
a
certain
kindness
of
manner
that
induced
him
to
hope
she
was
not
in
earnest
but
the
morning
after
they
had
anchored
under
the
hills
of
the
the
lady
had
reflected
more
seriously
than
usual
or
was
somewhat
less
in
good
humour
than
usual
or
the
captain
was
more
pressing
than
said
to
him
it
must
not
be
captain
fitzchrome
the
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
my
father
must
keep
his
borough
and
i
must
have
a
town
house
and
a
country
house
and
an
opera
box
and
a
carriage
it
is
not
well
for
either
of
us
that
we
should
flirt
any
longer
i
must
be
cruel
only
to
be
be
satisfied
with
the
assurance
that
you
alone
of
all
men
have
ever
broken
my
rest
to
be
sure
it
was
only
for
about
three
nights
in
all
but
that
is
too
the
captain
had
cœur
he
took
his
portfolio
under
his
arm
made
up
the
little
of
a
pedestrian
and
without
saying
a
word
to
anyone
wandered
off
at
random
among
the
mountains
after
the
lapse
of
a
day
or
two
the
captain
was
missed
and
everyone
marvelled
what
was
become
of
him
philpot
thought
he
must
have
been
exploring
a
river
and
fallen
in
and
got
drowned
in
the
process
firedamp
had
no
doubt
he
had
been
crossing
a
mountain
bog
and
had
been
suddenly
deprived
of
life
by
the
exhalations
of
marsh
miasmata
henbane
deemed
it
probable
that
he
had
been
tempted
in
some
wood
by
the
large
black
brilliant
berries
of
the
or
deadly
nightshade
and
lamented
that
he
had
not
been
by
to
administer
an
infallible
antidote
eavesdrop
hoped
the
particulars
of
his
fate
would
be
ascertained
and
asked
if
anyone
present
could
help
him
to
any
authentic
anecdotes
of
their
departed
friend
the
reverend
doctor
folliott
proposed
that
an
inquiry
should
be
instituted
as
to
whether
the
march
of
intellect
had
reached
that
neighbourhood
as
if
so
the
captain
had
probably
been
made
a
subject
for
science
mac
quedy
said
it
was
no
such
great
matter
to
ascertain
the
precise
mode
in
which
the
surplus
population
was
diminished
by
one
toogood
asseverated
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
surplus
population
and
that
the
land
properly
managed
would
maintain
twenty
times
its
present
inhabitants
and
hereupon
they
fell
into
a
disputation
lady
clarinda
did
not
doubt
that
the
captain
had
gone
away
designedly
she
missed
him
more
than
she
could
have
anticipated
and
wished
she
had
at
least
postponed
her
last
piece
of
cruelty
till
the
completion
of
their
homeward
voyage
chapter
xi
correspondence
base
is
the
slave
that
pistol
the
captain
was
neither
drowned
nor
poisoned
neither
miasmatised
nor
anatomised
but
before
we
proceed
to
account
for
him
we
must
look
back
to
a
young
lady
of
whom
some
little
notice
was
taken
in
the
first
chapter
and
who
though
she
has
since
been
out
of
sight
has
never
with
us
been
out
of
mind
miss
susannah
touchandgo
the
forsaken
of
the
junior
crotchet
whom
we
left
an
inmate
of
a
solitary
farm
in
one
of
the
deep
valleys
under
the
summits
of
meirion
comforting
her
wounded
spirit
with
air
and
exercise
rustic
cheer
music
painting
and
poetry
and
the
prattle
of
the
little
ap
llymrys
one
evening
after
an
interval
of
anxious
expectation
the
farmer
returning
from
market
brought
for
her
two
letters
of
which
the
contents
were
these
of
my
dear
child
i
am
anxious
to
learn
what
are
your
present
position
intention
and
prospects
the
fairies
who
dropped
gold
in
your
shoe
on
the
morning
when
i
ceased
to
be
a
respectable
man
in
london
will
soon
find
a
talismanic
channel
for
transmitting
you
a
stocking
full
of
dollars
which
will
fit
the
shoe
as
well
as
the
foot
of
cinderella
fitted
her
slipper
i
am
happy
to
say
i
am
again
become
a
respectable
man
it
was
always
my
ambition
to
be
a
respectable
man
and
i
am
a
very
respectable
man
here
in
this
new
township
of
a
new
state
where
i
have
purchased
five
thousand
acres
of
land
at
two
dollars
an
acre
hard
cash
and
established
a
very
flourishing
bank
the
notes
of
touchandgo
and
company
soft
cash
are
now
the
exclusive
currency
of
all
this
vicinity
this
is
the
land
in
which
all
men
flourish
but
there
are
three
classes
of
men
who
flourish
especially
preachers
and
manufacturers
and
as
one
of
the
latter
i
have
just
painted
the
word
bank
on
a
fine
slab
of
maple
which
was
green
and
growing
when
i
arrived
and
have
discounted
for
the
settlers
in
my
own
currency
sundry
bills
which
are
to
be
paid
when
the
proceeds
of
the
crop
they
have
just
sown
shall
return
from
new
orleans
so
that
my
notes
are
the
representatives
of
vegetation
that
is
to
be
and
i
am
accordingly
a
capitalist
of
the
first
magnitude
the
people
here
know
very
well
that
i
ran
away
from
london
but
the
most
of
them
have
run
away
from
some
place
or
other
and
they
have
a
great
respect
for
me
because
they
think
i
ran
away
with
something
worth
taking
which
few
of
them
had
the
luck
or
the
wit
to
do
this
gives
them
confidence
in
my
resources
at
the
same
time
that
as
there
is
nothing
portable
in
the
settlement
except
my
own
notes
they
have
no
fear
that
i
shall
run
away
with
them
they
know
i
am
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
principles
of
banking
and
as
they
have
plenty
of
industry
no
lack
of
sharpness
and
abundance
of
land
they
wanted
nothing
but
capital
to
organise
a
flourishing
settlement
and
this
capital
i
have
manufactured
to
the
extent
required
at
the
expense
of
a
small
importation
of
pens
ink
and
paper
and
two
or
three
inimitable
copper
plates
i
have
abundance
here
of
all
good
things
a
good
conscience
included
for
i
really
can
not
see
that
i
have
done
any
wrong
this
was
my
position
i
owed
half
a
million
of
money
and
i
had
a
trifle
in
my
pocket
it
was
clear
that
this
trifle
could
never
find
its
way
to
the
right
owner
the
question
was
whether
i
should
keep
it
and
live
like
a
gentleman
or
hand
it
over
to
lawyers
and
commissioners
of
bankruptcy
and
die
like
a
dog
on
a
dunghill
if
i
could
have
thought
that
the
said
lawyers
had
a
better
title
to
it
than
myself
i
might
have
hesitated
but
as
such
title
was
not
apparent
to
my
satisfaction
i
decided
the
question
in
my
own
favour
the
right
owners
as
i
have
already
said
being
out
of
the
question
altogether
i
have
always
taken
scientific
views
of
morals
and
politics
a
habit
from
which
i
derive
much
comfort
under
existing
circumstances
i
hope
you
adhere
to
your
music
though
i
can
not
hope
again
to
accompany
your
harp
with
my
flute
my
last
movement
was
too
for
those
whom
it
took
by
surprise
let
not
your
be
damped
by
young
crotchet
s
desertion
which
though
i
have
not
heard
it
i
take
for
granted
he
is
like
myself
a
scientific
politician
and
has
an
eye
as
keen
as
a
needle
to
his
own
interest
he
has
had
good
luck
so
far
and
is
gorgeous
in
the
spoils
of
many
gulls
but
i
think
the
polar
basin
and
walrus
company
will
be
too
much
for
him
yet
there
has
been
a
splendid
outlay
on
credit
and
he
is
the
only
man
of
the
original
parties
concerned
of
whom
his
majesty
s
sheriffs
could
give
any
account
i
will
not
ask
you
to
come
here
there
is
no
husband
for
you
the
men
smoke
drink
and
fight
and
break
more
of
their
own
heads
than
of
girls
hearts
those
among
them
who
are
musical
sing
nothing
but
psalms
they
are
excellent
fellows
in
their
way
but
you
would
not
like
them
here
are
no
rents
no
taxes
no
no
tithes
no
church
establishment
no
routs
no
clubs
no
rotten
boroughs
no
operas
no
concerts
no
theatres
no
beggars
no
thieves
no
king
no
lords
no
ladies
and
only
one
gentleman
videlicet
your
loving
father
timothy
touchandgo
send
you
one
of
my
notes
i
can
afford
to
part
with
it
if
you
are
accused
of
receiving
money
from
me
you
may
pay
it
over
to
my
assignees
robthetill
continues
to
be
my
factotum
i
say
no
more
of
him
in
this
place
he
will
give
you
an
account
of
dear
miss
mr
touchandgo
will
have
told
you
of
our
arrival
here
of
our
setting
up
a
bank
and
so
forth
we
came
here
in
a
tilted
waggon
which
served
us
for
parlour
kitchen
and
all
we
soon
got
up
a
and
unluckily
we
as
soon
got
it
down
again
for
the
first
fire
we
made
in
it
burned
down
house
and
all
however
our
second
experiment
was
more
fortunate
and
we
are
pretty
well
lodged
in
a
house
of
three
rooms
on
a
floor
i
should
say
the
floor
for
there
is
but
one
this
new
state
is
free
to
hold
slaves
all
the
new
states
have
not
this
privilege
touchandgo
has
bought
some
and
they
are
building
him
a
villa
touchandgo
is
in
a
thriving
way
but
he
is
not
happy
here
he
longs
for
parties
and
concerts
and
a
seat
in
congress
he
thinks
it
very
hard
that
he
can
not
buy
one
with
his
own
coinage
as
he
used
to
do
in
england
besides
he
is
afraid
of
the
regulators
who
if
they
do
not
like
a
man
s
character
wait
upon
him
and
flog
him
doubling
the
dose
at
stated
intervals
till
he
takes
himself
off
he
does
not
like
this
system
of
administering
justice
though
i
think
he
has
nothing
to
fear
from
it
he
has
the
character
of
having
money
which
is
the
best
of
all
characters
here
as
at
home
he
lets
his
old
english
prejudices
influence
his
opinions
of
his
new
neighbours
but
i
assure
you
they
have
many
virtues
though
they
do
keep
slaves
they
are
all
ready
to
fight
for
their
own
liberty
and
i
should
not
like
to
be
an
enemy
within
reach
of
one
of
their
rifles
when
i
say
enemy
i
include
bailiff
in
the
term
one
was
shot
not
long
ago
there
was
a
trial
the
jury
gave
two
dollars
damages
the
judge
said
they
must
find
guilty
or
not
guilty
but
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
they
would
not
call
him
prisoner
offered
to
fight
the
judge
upon
the
point
and
as
this
was
said
literally
not
metaphorically
and
the
counsel
was
a
stout
fellow
the
judge
gave
in
the
two
dollars
damages
were
not
paid
after
all
for
the
defendant
challenged
the
foreman
to
box
for
double
or
quits
and
the
foreman
was
beaten
the
folks
in
new
york
made
a
great
outcry
about
it
but
here
it
was
considered
all
as
it
should
be
so
you
see
miss
justice
liberty
and
everything
else
of
that
kind
are
different
in
different
places
just
as
suits
the
convenience
of
those
who
have
the
sword
in
their
own
hands
hoping
to
hear
of
your
health
and
happiness
i
remain
dear
miss
your
dutiful
servant
roderick
miss
touchandgo
replied
as
follows
to
the
first
of
these
letters
my
dear
father
i
am
sure
you
have
the
best
of
hearts
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
acted
with
the
best
intentions
my
lover
or
i
should
rather
say
my
fortune
s
lover
has
indeed
forsaken
me
i
can
not
say
i
did
not
feel
it
indeed
i
cried
very
much
and
the
altered
looks
of
people
who
used
to
be
so
delighted
to
see
me
really
annoyed
me
so
that
i
determined
to
change
the
scene
altogether
i
have
come
into
wales
and
am
boarding
with
a
farmer
and
his
wife
their
stock
of
english
is
very
small
but
i
managed
to
agree
with
them
and
they
have
four
of
the
sweetest
children
i
ever
saw
to
whom
i
teach
all
i
know
and
i
manage
to
pick
up
some
welsh
i
have
puzzled
out
a
little
song
which
i
think
very
pretty
i
have
translated
it
into
english
and
i
send
it
you
with
the
original
air
you
shall
play
it
on
your
flute
at
eight
o
clock
every
saturday
evening
and
i
will
play
and
sing
it
at
the
same
time
and
i
will
fancy
that
i
hear
my
dear
papa
accompanying
me
the
people
in
london
said
very
unkind
things
of
you
they
hurt
me
very
much
at
the
time
but
now
i
am
out
of
their
way
i
do
not
seem
to
think
their
opinion
of
much
consequence
i
am
sure
when
i
recollect
at
leisure
everything
i
have
seen
and
heard
among
them
i
can
not
make
out
what
they
do
that
is
so
virtuous
as
to
set
them
up
for
judges
of
morals
and
i
am
sure
they
never
speak
the
truth
about
anything
and
there
is
no
sincerity
in
either
their
love
or
their
friendship
an
old
welsh
bard
here
who
wears
a
waistcoat
embroidered
with
leeks
and
is
called
the
green
bard
of
cadeir
idris
says
the
scotch
would
be
the
best
people
in
the
world
if
there
was
nobody
but
themselves
to
give
them
a
character
and
so
i
think
would
the
londoners
i
hate
the
very
thought
of
them
for
i
do
believe
they
would
have
broken
my
heart
if
i
had
not
got
out
of
their
way
now
i
shall
write
you
another
letter
very
soon
and
describe
to
you
the
country
and
the
people
and
the
children
and
how
i
amuse
myself
and
everything
that
i
think
you
will
like
to
hear
about
and
when
i
seal
this
letter
i
shall
drop
a
kiss
on
the
cover
your
loving
daughter
susannah
touchandgo
robthetill
i
will
write
to
him
in
a
day
or
two
this
is
the
little
song
i
spoke
of
beyond
the
sea
beyond
the
sea
my
heart
is
gone
far
far
from
me
and
ever
on
its
track
will
flee
my
thoughts
my
dreams
beyond
the
sea
beyond
the

beyond
the
sea
the

oh
happy

were
i
like
thee
i
too
would
fly
beyond
the

beyond
the

beyond
the

kindly
hearts
and

but
here
for
me
they

not

is
gone

how
sweet
to
minds
that
love
not
sordid
ways
is
solitude
the
captain
wandered
despondingly
up
and
down
hill
for
several
days
passing
many
hours
of
each
in
sitting
on
rocks
making
almost
mechanically
sketches
of
waterfalls
and
mountain
pools
taking
care
nevertheless
to
be
always
before
nightfall
in
a
comfortable
inn
where
being
a
temperate
man
he
whiled
away
the
evening
with
making
a
bottle
of
sherry
into
negus
his
rambles
brought
him
at
length
into
the
interior
of
merionethshire
the
land
of
all
that
is
beautiful
in
nature
and
all
that
is
lovely
in
woman
here
in
a
secluded
village
he
found
a
little
inn
of
small
pretension
and
much
comfort
he
felt
so
satisfied
with
his
quarters
and
discovered
every
day
so
much
variety
in
the
scenes
of
the
surrounding
mountains
that
his
inclination
to
proceed
farther
diminished
progressively
it
is
one
thing
to
follow
the
high
road
through
a
country
with
every
principally
remarkable
object
carefully
noted
down
in
a
book
taking
as
therein
directed
a
guide
at
particular
points
to
the
more
recondite
sights
it
is
another
to
sit
down
on
one
chosen
spot
especially
when
the
choice
is
unpremeditated
and
from
thence
by
a
series
of
explorations
to
come
day
by
day
on
unanticipated
scenes
the
latter
process
has
many
advantages
over
the
former
it
is
free
from
the
disappointment
which
attends
excited
expectation
when
imagination
has
outstripped
reality
and
from
the
accidents
that
mar
the
scheme
of
the
tourist
s
single
day
when
the
valleys
may
be
drenched
with
rain
or
the
mountains
shrouded
with
mist
the
captain
was
one
morning
preparing
to
sally
forth
on
his
usual
exploration
when
he
heard
a
voice
without
inquiring
for
a
guide
to
the
ruined
castle
the
voice
seemed
familiar
to
him
and
going
forth
into
the
gateway
he
recognised
chainmail
after
greetings
and
inquiries
for
the
absent
you
vanished
very
abruptly
captain
said
chainmail
from
our
party
on
the
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
a
particular
reason
for
trying
the
effect
of
absence
from
a
part
of
that
party
surmised
as
much
at
the
same
time
the
unusual
melancholy
of
an
in
general
most
vivacious
young
lady
made
me
wonder
at
your
having
acted
so
precipitately
the
lady
s
heart
is
yours
if
there
be
truth
in
signs
are
not
now
what
they
were
in
the
days
of
the
old
song
will
love
be
controlled
by
advice
true
hearts
heads
and
arms
have
all
degenerated
most
sadly
we
can
no
more
feel
the
high
impassioned
love
of
the
ages
which
some
people
have
the
impudence
to
call
dark
than
we
can
wield
king
richard
s
battleaxe
bend
robin
hood
s
bow
or
flourish
the
oaken
graft
of
the
pindar
of
wakefield
still
we
have
our
tastes
and
feelings
though
they
deserve
not
the
name
of
passions
and
some
of
us
may
pluck
up
spirit
to
try
to
carry
a
point
when
we
reflect
that
we
have
to
contend
with
men
no
better
than
ourselves
do
not
now
break
lances
for
ladies
nor
even
bulrushes
we
jingle
purses
for
them
flourish
banners
and
tilt
with
scrolls
of
parchment
which
sort
of
tilting
i
have
been
thrown
from
the
saddle
i
presume
it
was
not
love
that
led
you
from
the
flotilla
no
means
i
was
tempted
by
the
sight
of
an
old
tower
not
to
leave
this
land
of
ruined
castles
without
having
collected
a
few
hints
for
the
adornment
of
my
baronial
hall
understand
you
live
with
your
domestics
you
will
have
more
difficulty
in
finding
a
lady
who
would
adopt
your
fashion
of
living
than
one
who
would
prefer
you
to
a
richer
man
true
i
have
tried
the
experiment
on
several
as
guests
but
once
was
enough
for
them
so
i
suppose
i
shall
die
a
bachelor
see
like
some
others
of
my
friends
you
will
give
up
anything
except
your
hobby
will
give
up
anything
but
my
baronial
hall
will
never
find
a
wife
for
your
purpose
unless
in
the
daughter
of
some
farmer
i
thank
you
i
must
have
a
lady
of
gentle
blood
i
shall
not
marry
below
my
own
condition
i
am
too
much
of
a
herald
i
have
too
much
of
the
twelfth
century
in
me
for
that
then
your
chance
is
not
much
better
than
mine
a
beauty
would
scarcely
be
better
pleased
with
your
baronial
hall
than
with
my
more
humble
offer
of
love
in
a
cottage
she
must
have
a
and
an
and
roll
about
the
streets
in
a
carriage
especially
if
her
father
has
a
rotten
borough
for
the
sake
of
which
he
sells
his
daughter
that
he
may
continue
to
sell
his
country
but
you
were
inquiring
for
a
guide
to
the
ruined
castle
in
this
vicinity
i
know
the
way
and
will
conduct
you
the
proposal

it
not
be
a

thing
captain
you
being
picturesque
and
i
poetical
you
being
for
the
lights
and
shadows
of
the
present
and
i
for
those
of
the
past
if
we
were
to
go
together
over
the
ground
which
was
travelled
in
the
twelfth
century
by
giraldus
de
barri
when
he
accompanied
archbishop
baldwin
to
preach
the
crusade
in
my
present
frame
of
mind
could
be
more
agreeable
to
me
would
provide
ourselves
with
his

what
has
been
with
what
is
contemplate
in
their
decay
the
castles
and
abbeys
which
he
saw
in
their
strength
and
splendour
and
while
you
were
sketching
their
remains
i
would
dispassionately
inquire
what
has
been
gained
by
the
change
it
so
but
the
scheme
was
no
sooner
arranged
than
the
captain
was
summoned
to
london
by
a
letter
on
business
which
he
did
not
expect
to
detain
him
long
chainmail
who
like
the
captain
was
fascinated
with
the
inn
and
the
scenery
determined
to
await
his
companion
s
return
and
having
furnished
him
with
a
list
of
books
which
he
was
to
bring
with
him
from
london
took
leave
of
him
and
began
to
pass
his
days
like
the
heroes
of
ariosto
who
il

one
day
chainmail
traced
upwards
the
course
of
a
mountain
stream
to
a
spot
where
a
small
waterfall
threw
itself
over
a
slab
of
perpendicular
rock
which
seemed
to
bar
his
farther
progress
on
a
nearer
view
he
discovered
a
flight
of
steps
roughly
hewn
in
the
rock
on
one
side
of
the
fall
ascending
these
steps
he
entered
a
narrow
winding
pass
between
high
and
naked
rocks
that
afforded
only
space
for
a
rough
footpath
carved
on
one
side
at
some
height
above
the
torrent
the
pass
opened
on
a
lake
from
which
the
stream
issued
and
which
lay
like
a
dark
mirror
set
in
a
gigantic
frame
of
mountain
precipices
fragments
of
rock
lay
scattered
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
some
in
the
water
chainmail
scrambled
some
way
over
these
fragments
till
the
base
of
a
rock
sinking
abruptly
in
the
water
effectually
barred
his
progress
he
sat
down
on
a
large
smooth
stone
the
faint
murmur
of
the
stream
he
had
quitted
the
occasional
flapping
of
the
wings
of
the
heron
and
at
long
intervals
the
solitary
springing
of
a
trout
were
the
only
sounds
that
came
to
his
ear
the
sun
shone
brightly
down
the
opposite
rocks
presenting
on
their
irregular
faces
strong
masses
of
light
and
shade
suddenly
he
heard
the
dash
of
a
paddle
and
turning
his
eyes
saw
a
solitary
and
beautiful
girl
gliding
over
the
lake
in
a
coracle
she
was
proceeding
from
the
vicinity
of
the
point
he
had
quitted
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
her
apparel
was
rustic
but
there
was
in
its
style
something
more
in
its
arrangement
something
more
of
elegance
and
precision
than
was
common
to
the
mountain
peasant
girl
it
had
more
of
the
of
the
opera
than
of
the
genuine
mountaineer
so
at
least
thought
chainmail
but
she
passed
so
rapidly
and
took
him
so
much
by
surprise
that
he
had
little
opportunity
for
accurate
observation
he
saw
her
land
at
the
farther
extremity
and
disappear
among
the
rocks
he
rose
from
his
seat
returned
to
the
mouth
of
the
pass
stepped
from
stone
to
stone
across
the
stream
and
attempted
to
pass
round
by
the
other
side
of
the
lake
but
there
again
the
abruptly
sinking
precipice
closed
his
way
day
after
day
he
haunted
the
spot
but
never
saw
again
either
the
damsel
or
the
coracle
at
length
marvelling
at
himself
for
being
so
solicitous
about
the
apparition
of
a
peasant
girl
in
a
coracle
who
could
not
by
any
possibility
be
anything
to
him
he
resumed
his
explorations
in
another
direction
one
day
he
wandered
to
the
ruined
castle
on
the
which
was
not
very
distant
from
his
inn
and
sitting
on
the
rock
near
the
base
of
the
ruin
was
calling
up
the
forms
of
past
ages
on
the
wall
of
an
ivied
tower
when
on
its
summit
appeared
a
female
figure
whom
he
recognised
in
an
instant
for
his
nymph
of
the
coracle
the
folds
of
the
blue
gown
pressed
by
the
against
one
of
the
most
symmetrical
of
figures
the
black
feather
of
the
black
hat
and
the
ringleted
hair
beneath
it
fluttering
in
the
wind
the
apparent
peril
of
her
position
on
the
edge
of
the
mouldering
wall
from
whose
immediate
base
the
rock
went
down
perpendicularly
to
the
sea
presented
a
singularly
interesting
combination
to
the
eye
of
the
young
antiquary
chainmail
had
to
pass
half
round
the
castle
on
the
land
side
before
he
could
reach
the
entrance
he
coasted
the
dry
and
moat
crossed
the
unguarded
bridge
passed
the
unportcullised
arch
of
the
gateway
entered
the
castle
court
ascertained
the
tower
ascended
the
broken
stairs
and
stood
on
the
ivied
wall
but
the
nymph
of
the
place
was
gone
he
searched
the
ruins
within
and
without
but
he
found
not
what
he
sought
he
haunted
the
castle
day
after
day
as
he
had
done
the
lake
but
the
damsel
appeared
no
more

from
the

she

with

into

all
the

the

startling
light
which
the
conduct
of

on

throws
on
a
young
and
inexperienced
mind
the
doctrines
of
the
philosopher
of

with
double

upon
her
sympathies
she
imbibed
the
sweet
poison
as
somebody
calls
it
of
his
writings
even
to
a
love
of
truth
which
every
wise
man
knows
ought
to
be
left
to
those
who
can
get
anything
by
it
the
society
of
children
the
beauties
of
nature
the
solitude
of
the
mountains
became
her
consolation
and
by
degrees
her
delight
the
gay
society
from
which
she
had
been
excluded
remained
on
her
memory
only
as
a
disagreeable
dream
she
imbibed
her
new
monitor

ideas
of
simplicity
of
dress
assimilating
her
own
with
that

gown
the
black
stockings
the
shoes
tied
on
the
instep
pride
was
perhaps
at
the
bottom
of
the
change
she
was
willing
to
impose
in
some
measure
on
herself
by
marking
a
contemptuous
indifference
to
the
characteristics
of
the
class
of
society
from
which
she
had
fallen
and
with
the
food
of
pride
sustained
her
soul
in
solitude
it
is
true
that
she
somewhat
modified
the
forms
of
her
rustic
dress
to
the
black
hat
she
added
a
black
feather
to
the
blue
gown
she
added
a
tippet
and
a
waistband
fastened
in
front
with
a
silver
buckle
she
wore
her
black
stockings
very
smooth
and
tight
on
her
ankles
and
tied
her
shoes
in
tasteful
bows
with
the
nicest
possible

in

apparel

in

she
added

made
dreadful
havoc

by
degrees
her
favourite
haunt
a
path
turning
and
returning
at
acute
angles
led
down
a
steep
slope
to
the
edge
of
a
chasm
where
a
pool
or
of
a
torrent
lay
far
below
a
cataract
fell
in
a
single
sheet
into
the
pool
the
pool
boiled
and
bubbled
at
the
base
of
the
fall
but
through
the
greater
part
of
its
extent
lay
calm
deep
and
black
as
if
the
cataract
had
plunged
through
it
to
an
unimaginable
depth
without
disturbing
its
eternal
repose
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
pool
the
rocks
almost
met
at
their
summits
the
trees
of
the
opposite
banks
intermingled
their
leaves
and
another
cataract
plunged
from
the
pool
into
a
chasm
on
which
the
sunbeams
never
gleamed
high
above
on
both
sides
the
steep
woody
slopes
of
the
dingle
soared
into
the
sky
and
from
a
fissure
in
the
rock
on
which
the
little
path
terminated
a
single
gnarled
and
twisted
oak
stretched
itself
over
the
pool
forming
a
fork
with
its
boughs
at
a
short
distance
from
the
rock
miss
susannah
often
sat
on
the
rock
with
her
feet
resting
on
this
tree
in
time
she
made
her
seat
on
the
tree
itself
with
her
feet
hanging
over
the
abyss
and
at
length
she
accustomed
herself
to
lie
along
upon
its
trunk
with
her
side
on
the
mossy
bole
of
the
fork
and
an
arm
round
one
of
the
branches
from
this
position
a
portion
of
the
sky
and
the
woods
was
reflected
in
the
pool
which
from
its
bank
was
but
a
mass
of
darkness
the
first
time
she
reclined
in
this
manner
her
heart
beat
audibly
in
time
she
lay
down
as
calmly
as
on
the
mountain
heather
the
perception
of
the
sublime
was
probably
heightened
by
an
intermingled
sense
of
danger
and
perhaps
that
indifference
to
life
which
early
disappointment
forces
upon
sensitive
minds
was
necessary
to
the
first
experiment
there
was
in
the
novelty
and
strangeness
of
the
position
an
excitement
which
never
wholly
passed
away
but
which
became
gradually
subordinate
to
the
influence
at
once
tranquillising
and
elevating
of
the
mingled
eternity
of
motion
sound
and
solitude
one
sultry
noon
she
descended
into
this
retreat
with
a
mind
more
than
usually
disturbed
by
reflections
on
the
past
she
lay
in
her
favourite
position
sometimes
gazing
on
the
cataract
looking
sometimes
up
the
steep
sylvan
acclivities
into
the
narrow
space
of
the
cloudless
ether
sometimes
down
into
the
abyss
of
the
pool
and
the
deep
reflections
that
opened
another
immensity
below
her
the
distressing
recollections
of
the
morning
the
world
and
all
its
littlenesses
faded
from
her
thoughts
like
a
dream
but
her
wounded
and
wearied
spirit
drank
in
too
deeply
the
tranquillising
power
of
the
place
and
she
dropped
asleep
upon
the
tree
like
a
on
the
mast
at
this
moment
chainmail
emerged
into
daylight
on
a
projection
of
the
opposite
rock
having
struck
down
through
the
woods
in
search
of
unsophisticated
scenery
the
scene
he
discovered
filled
him
with
delight
he
seated
himself
on
the
rock
and
fell
into
one
of
his
romantic
reveries
when
suddenly
the
semblance
of
a
black
hat
and
feather
caught
his
eye
among
the
foliage
of
the
projecting
oak
he
started
up
shifted
his
position
and
got
a
glimpse
of
a
blue
gown
it
was
his
lady
of
the
lake
his
enchantress
of
the
ruined
castle
divided
from
him
by
a
barrier
which
at
a
few
yards
below
he
could
almost
overleap
yet
unapproachable
but
by
a
circuit
perhaps
of
many
hours
he
watched
with
intense
anxiety
to
listen
if
she
breathed
was
out
of
the
question
the
noses
of
a
dean
and
chapter
would
have
been
soundless
in
the
roar
of
the
torrent
from
her
extreme
stillness
she
appeared
to
sleep
yet
what
creature
not
desperate
would
go
wilfully
to
sleep
in
such
a
place
was
she
asleep
then
nay
was
she
alive
she
was
as
motionless
as
death
had
she
been
murdered
thrown
from
above
and
caught
in
the
tree
she
lay
too
regularly
and
too
composedly
for
such
a
supposition
she
was
asleep
then
and
in
all
probability
her
waking
would
be
fatal
he
shifted
his
position
below
the
pool
two
rocks
nearly
overarched
the
chasm
leaving
just
such
a
space
at
the
summit
as
was
within
the
possibility
of
a
leap
the
torrent
roared
below
in
a
fearful
gulf
he
paused
some
time
on
the
brink
measuring
the
practicability
and
the
danger
and
casting
every
now
and
then
an
anxious
glance
to
his
sleeping
beauty
in
one
of
these
glances
he
saw
a
slight
movement
of
the
blue
gown
and
in
a
moment
after
the
black
hat
and
feather
dropped
into
the
pool
reflection
was
lost
for
a
moment
and
by
a
sudden
impulse
he
bounded
over
the
chasm
he
stood
above
the
projecting
oak
the
unknown
beauty
lay
like
the
nymph
of
the
scene
her
long
black
hair
which
the
fall
of
her
hat
had
disengaged
from
its
fastenings
drooping
through
the
boughs
he
saw
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
prevent
her
throwing
her
feet
off
the
trunk
in
the
first
movements
of
waking
he
sat
down
on
the
rock
and
placed
his
feet
on
the
stem
securing
her
ankles
between
his
own
one
of
her
arms
was
round
a
branch
of
the
fork
the
other
lay
loosely
on
her
side
the
hand
of
this
arm
he
endeavoured
to
reach
by
leaning
forward
from
his
seat
he
approximated
but
could
not
touch
it
after
several
tantalising
efforts
he
gave
up
the
point
in
despair
he
did
not
attempt
to
wake
her
because
he
feared
it
might
have
bad
consequences
and
he
resigned
himself
to
expect
the
moment
of
her
natural
waking
determined
not
to
stir
from
his
post
if
she
should
sleep
till
midnight
in
this
period
of
forced
inaction
he
could
contemplate
at
leisure
the
features
and
form
of
his
charmer
she
was
not
one
of
the
slender
beauties
of
romance
she
was
as
plump
as
a
partridge
her
cheeks
were
two
roses
not
absolutely
damask
yet
verging
thereupon
her
lips
of
equal
size
her
nose
regular
and
almost
grecian
her
forehead
high
and
delicately
fair
her
eyebrows
symmetrically
arched
her
eyelashes
long
black
and
silky
fitly
corresponding
with
the
beautiful
tresses
that
hung
among
the
leaves
of
the
oak
like
clusters
of
wandering
grapes
her
eyes
were
yet
to
be
seen
but
how
could
he
doubt
that
their
opening
would
be
the
rising
of
the
sun
when
all
that
surrounded
their
fringy
portals
was
radiant
as
the
forehead
of
the
morning
sky

the

awoke
she
was
startled
at
the
sudden
sight
of
the
stranger
and
somewhat
terrified
at
the
first
perception
of
her
position
but
she
soon
recovered
her
and
extending
her
hand
to
the
offered
hand
of
chainmail
she
raised
herself
up
on
the
tree
and
stepped
on
the
rocky
bank
chainmail
solicited
permission
to
attend
her
to
her
home
which
the
young
lady
graciously
conceded
they
emerged
from
the
woody
dingle
traversed
an
open
heath
wound
along
a
mountain
road
by
the
shore
of
a
lake
descended
to
the
deep
bed
of
another
stream
crossed
it
by
a
series
of
ascended
to
some
height
on
the
opposite
side
and
followed
upwards
the
line
of
the
stream
till
the
banks
opened
into
a
spacious
amphitheatre
where
stood
in
its
fields
and
meadows
the
farmhouse
of
during
this
walk
they
had
kept
up
a
pretty
animated
conversation
the
lady
had
lost
her
hat
and
as
she
turned
towards
chainmail
in
speaking
to
him
there
was
no
envious
projection
of
brim
to
intercept
the
beams
of
those
radiant
eyes
he
had
been
so
anxious
to
see
unclosed
there
was
in
them
a
mixture
of
softness
and
brilliancy
the
perfection
of
the
beauty
of
female
eyes
such
as
some
men
have
passed
through
life
without
seeing
and
such
as
no
man
ever
saw
in
any
pair
of
eyes
but
once
such
as
can
never
be
seen
and
forgotten
young
crotchet
had
seen
it
he
had
not
forgotten
it
but
he
had
trampled
on
its
memory
as
the
renegade
tramples
on
the
emblems
of
a
faith
which
his
interest
only
and
not
his
heart
or
his
reason
has
rejected
her
hair
streamed
over
her
shoulders
the
loss
of
the
black
feather
had
left
nothing
but
the
rustic
costume
the
blue
gown
the
black
stockings
and
the
shoes
her
voice
had
that
full
soft
volume
of
melody
which
gives
to
common
speech
the
fascination
of
music
chainmail
could
not
reconcile
the
dress
of
the
damsel
with
her
conversation
and
manners
he
threw
out
a
remote
question
or
two
with
the
hope
of
solving
the
riddle
but
receiving
no
reply
he
became
satisfied
that
she
was
not
disposed
to
be
communicative
respecting
herself
and
fearing
to
offend
her
fell
upon
other
topics
they
talked
of
the
scenes
of
the
mountains
of
the
dingle
the
ruined
castle
the
solitary
lake
she
told
him
that
lake
lay
under
the
mountains
behind
her
home
and
the
coracle
and
the
pass
at
the
extremity
saved
a
long
circuit
to
the
nearest
village
whither
she
sometimes
went
to
inquire
for
letters
chainmail
felt
curious
to
know
from
whom
these
letters
might
be
and
he
again
threw
out
two
or
three
fishing
questions
to
which
as
before
he
obtained
no
answer
the
only
living
biped
they
met
in
their
walk
was
the
unfortunate
harry
with
whom
they
fell
in
by
the
who
seeing
the
girl
of
his
heart
hanging
on
another
man
s
arm
and
concluding
at
once
that
they
were
keeping
company
fixed
on
her
a
mingled
look
of
surprise
reproach
and
tribulation
and
unable
to
control
his
feelings
under
the
sudden
shock
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
blubbered
till
the
rocks
they
left
him
mingling
his
tears
with
the
stream
and
his
lamentations
with
its
murmurs
chainmail
inquired
who
that
strange
creature
might
be
and
what
was
the
matter
with
him
the
young
lady
answered
that
he
was
a
very
worthy
young
man
to
whom
she
had
been
the
innocent
cause
of
much
unhappiness

him
sincerely
said
chainmail
and
nevertheless
he
could
scarcely
restrain
his
laughter

unfortunate
rustic
lover
had
presented

all
round
her
and

was

out
in
great
haste
and
invited
chainmail
to
walk
in
and
dine
chainmail
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
twice
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
party
miss
susan
and
chainmail
and
and
progeny
were
seated
over
a
clean
homespun

ornamented
with
fowls
and
bacon
a

of

another
of

which

was
poiled
with

as
coot
as

a
bowl
of

for
the

and
an
immense
brown
jug
of
foaming
ale
with
which
seemed
to
delight
in
filling
the
horn
of
his
new
guest

were

we
shall
leave
this
tempting
field
of
interesting
expatiation
to
those
whose
brains
are
for
spinning
prose
by
the
furlong
to
be
trumpeted
in
paragraphs
in

corner
of

modern

having
attained
the
honourable
distinction
of
sharing
with
blacking

which
used
to
be
monopolised
by

the
lottery
whereby
that
very
enlightened
community

is
tricked
into
the
perusal

exemplary

who
see
through

have
no
reason
to
complain
since

these
bushes
of
venal
panegyric
point
out
very
clearly
that
the

celebrate

not
worth
reading
the
party
dined
very
comfortably
in
a
corner
most
remote
from
the
fire
and
chainmail
very
soon
found
his
head
swimming
with
two
or
three
horns
of
ale
of
a
potency
to
which
even
he
was
unaccustomed
after
dinner
made
him
finish
a
bottle
of
mead
which
he
willingly
accepted
both
as
an
excuse
to
remain
and
as
a
drink
of
the
dark
ages
which
he
had
no
doubt
was
a
genuine
brewage
from
uncorrupted
tradition
in
the
meantime
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
removed
the
children
had
brought
out
miss
susannah
s
harp
she
began
without
affectation
to
play
and
sing
to
the
children
as
was
her
custom
of
an
afternoon
first
in
their
own
language
and
their
national
melodies
then
in
english
but
she
was
soon
interrupted
by
a
general
call
of
little
voices
for
ouf
di
she
complied
with
the
request
and
sang
the
ballad
from
paër
s
un
dì
carco
il
the
children
were
very
familiar
with
every
syllable
of
this
ballad
which
had
been
often
fully
explained
to
them
they
danced
in
a
circle
with
the
burden
of
every
verse
shouting
out
the
chorus
with
good
articulation
and
joyous
energy
and
at
the
end
of
the
second
stanza
where
the
traveller
has
his
nose
pinched
by
his
grandmother
s
ghost
every
nose
in
the
party
was
nipped
by
a
pair
of
little
fingers
chainmail
who
was
not
prepared
for
the
process
came
in
for
a
very
energetic
tweak
from
a
chubby
girl
that
sprang
suddenly
on
his
knees
for
the
purpose
and
made
the
roof
ring
with
her
laughter
so
passed
the
time
till
evening
when
chainmail
moved
to
depart
but
it
turned
out
on
inquiry
that
he
was
some
miles
from
his
inn
that
the
way
was
intricate
and
that
he
must
not
make
any
difficulty
about
accepting
the
farmer
s
hospitality
till
morning
the
evening
set
in
with
rain
the
fire
was
found
agreeable
they
drew
around
it
the
young
lady
made
tea
and
afterwards
from
time
to
time
at
chainmail
s
special
request
delighted
his
ear
with
passages
of
ancient
music
then
came
a
supper
of
lake
trout
fried
on
the
spot
and
thrown
smoking
hot
from
the
pan
to
the
plate
then
came
a
brewage
which
the
farmer
called
his
nightcap
of
which
he
insisted
on
chainmail
s
taking
his
full
share
after
which
the
gentleman
remembered
nothing
till
he
awoke
the
next
morning
to
the
pleasant
consciousness
that
he
was
under
the
same
roof
with
one
of
the
most
fascinating
creatures
under
the
canopy
of

his
lips
in
the
meantime
he
left
no
means
untried
to
pluck
out
the
heart
of
her
mystery
the
young
lady
soon
divined
his
passion
and
penetrated
his
prejudices
she
began
to
look
on
him
with
favourable
eyes
but
she
feared
her
name
and
parentage
would
present
an
insuperable
barrier
to
his
feudal
pride
things
were
in
this
state
when
the
captain
returned
and
unpacked
his
maps
and
books
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
captain
i
find
so
many
objects
of
attraction
in
this
neighbourhood
that
i
would
gladly
postpone
our
purpose
this
neighbourhood
has
many
attractions
but
there
is
something
very
inviting
in
the
scheme
you
laid
down
doubt
there
is
something
very
tempting
in
the
route
of
giraldus
de
barri
but
there
are
better
things
in
this
vicinity
even
than
that
to
tell
you
the
truth
captain
i
have
fallen
in
love
while
i
have
been
away
so
plunge
must
have
been
very
sudden
if
you
are
already
over
head
and
ears
deep
as
what
may
that
be
pool
not
far
off
a
of
a
mountain
stream
which
is
said
to
have
no
bottom
there
is
a
tradition
connected
with
it
and
here
is
a
ballad
on
it
at
your
service
the
pool
of
the
diving
friar
gwenwynwyn
withdrew
from
the
feasts
of
his
hall
he
slept
very
little
he
prayed
not
at
all
he
pondered
and
wandered
and
studied
alone
and
sought
night
and
day
the
philosopher
s
stone
he
found
it
at
length
and
he
made
its
first
proof
by
turning
to
gold
all
the
lead
of
his
roof
then
he
bought
some
magnanimous
heroes
all
fire
who
lived
but
to
smite
and
be
smitten
for
hire
with
these
on
the
plains
like
a
torrent
he
broke
he
filled
the
whole
country
with
flame
and
with
smoke
he
killed
all
the
swine
and
he
broached
all
the
wine
he
drove
off
the
sheep
and
the
beeves
and
the
kine
he
took
castles
and
towns
he
cut
short
limbs
and
lives
he
made
orphans
and
widows
of
children
and
wives
this
course
many
years
he
triumphantly
ran
and
did
mischief
enough
to
be
called
a
great
man
when
at
last
he
had
gained
all
for
which
he
held
striven
he
bethought
him
of
buying
a
passport
to
heaven
good
and
great
as
he
was
yet
he
did
not
well
know
how
soon
or
which
way
his
great
spirit
might
go
he
sought
the
grey
friars
who
beside
a
wild
stream
refected
their
frames
on
a
primitive
scheme
the
gravest
and
wisest
gwenwynwyn
found
out
all
lonely
and
ghostly
and
angling
for
trout
below
the
white
dash
of
a
mighty
cascade
where
a
pool
of
the
stream
a
deep
made
and
oaks
stretched
their
branches
on
high
the
friar
stood
musing
and
throwing
his
fly
to
him
said
gwenwynwyn
hold
father
here
s
store
for
the
good
of
the
church
and
the
good
of
the
poor
then
he
gave
him
the
stone
but
ere
more
he
could
speak
wrath
came
on
the
friar
so
holy
and
meek
he
had
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
receive
the
red
gold
and
he
thought
himself
mocked
by
gwenwynwyn
the
bold
and
in
scorn
of
the
gift
and
in
rage
at
the
giver
he
jerked
it
immediately
into
the
river
gwenwynwyn
aghast
not
a
syllable
spake
the
philosopher
s
stone
made
a
duck
and
a
drake
two
systems
of
circles
a
moment
were
seen
and
the
stream
smoothed
them
off
as
they
never
had
been
gwenwynwyn
regained
and
uplifted
his
voice
oh
friar
grey
friar
full
rash
was
thy
choice
the
stone
the
good
stone
which
away
thou
hast
thrown
was
the
stone
of
all
stones
the
philosopher
s
the
friar
looked
pale
when
his
error
he
knew
the
friar
looked
red
and
the
friar
looked
blue
and
heels
over
head
from
the
point
of
a
rock
he
plunged
without
stopping
to
pull
off
his
frock
he
dived
very
deep
but
he
dived
all
in
vain
the
prize
he
had
slighted
he
found
not
again
many
times
did
the
friar
his
diving
renew
and
deeper
and
deeper
the
river
still
grew
gwenwynwyn
gazed
long
of
his
senses
in
doubt
to
see
the
grey
friar
a
diver
so
stout
then
sadly
and
slowly
his
castle
he
sought
and
left
the
friar
diving
like
dabchick
distraught
gwenwynwyn
fell
sick
with
alarm
and
despite
died
and
went
to
the
devil
the
very
same
night
the
magnanimous
heroes
he
held
in
his
pay
sacked
his
castle
and
marched
with
the
plunder
away
no
knell
on
the
silence
of
midnight
was
rolled
for
the
flight
of
the
soul
of
gwenwynwyn
the
bold
the
brethren
unfeed
let
the
mighty
ghost
pass
without
praying
a
prayer
or
intoning
a
mass
the
friar
haunted
ever
beside
the
dark
stream
the
philosopher
s
stone
was
his
thought
and
his
dream
and
day
after
day
ever
head
under
heels
he
dived
all
the
time
he
could
spare
from
his
meals
he
dived
and
he
dived
to
the
end
of
his
days
as
the
peasants
oft
witnessed
with
fear
and
amaze
the
mad
friar
s
long
was
their
theme
and
no
plummet
can
fathom
that
pool
of
the
stream
and
still
when
light
clouds
on
the
midnight
winds
ride
if
by
moonlight
you
stray
on
the
lone
the
ghost
of
the
friar
may
be
seen
diving
there
with
head
in
the
water
and
heels
in
the
air
your
ballad
is
very
pleasant
you
shall
show
me
the
scene
and
i
will
sketch
it
but
just
now
i
am
more
interested
about
your
love
what
heroine
of
the
twelfth
century
has
risen
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
and
looked
down
on
you
from
the
ivied
battlements
are
nearer
the
mark
than
you
suppose
even
from
those
battlements
a
heroine
of
the
twelfth
century
has
looked
down
on
me
some
vision
of
an
ideal
beauty
i
suppose
the
whole
will
end
in
another
tradition
and
a
ballad
flesh
and
blood
as
genuine
as
lady
clarinda
i
will
tell
you
the
story
chainmail
narrated
his
adventures
you
seem
to
have
found
what
you
wished
chance
has
thrown
in
your
way
what
none
of
the
gods
would
have
ventured
to
promise
you
but
i
know
nothing
of
her
birth
and
parentage
she
tells
me
nothing
of
herself
and
i
have
no
right
to
question
her
directly
appears
to
be
expressly
destined
for
the
light
of
your
baronial
hall
introduce
me
in
this
case
two
heads
are
better
than
one
i
thank
you
leave
me
to
manage
my
chance
of
a
prize
and
keep
you
to
your
own
chance
of
as
you
please
well
i
will
pitch
my
tent
here
till
i
have
filled
my
portfolio
and
shall
be
glad
of
as
much
of
your
company
as
you
can
spare
from
more
attractive
society
matters
went
on
pretty
smoothly
for
several
days
when
an
unlucky
newspaper
threw
all
into
confusion
chainmail
received
newspapers
by
the
post
which
came
in
three
times
a
week
one
morning
over
their
breakfast
the
captain
had
read
half
a
newspaper
very
complacently
when
suddenly
he
started
up
in
a
frenzy
hurled
over
the
breakfast
table
and
bouncing
from
the
apartment
knocked
down
harry
ap
heather
who
was
coming
in
at
the
door
to
challenge
his
supposed
rival
to
a
harry
sprang
up
in
a
double
rage
and
intercepted
chainmail
s
pursuit
of
the
captain
placing
himself
in
the
doorway
in
a
pugilistic
attitude
chainmail
not
being
disposed
for
this
mode
of
combat
stepped
back
into
the
parlour
took
the
poker
in
his
right
hand
and
displacing
the
loose
bottom
of
a
large
elbow
chair
threw
it
over
his
left
arm
as
a
shield
harry
not
liking
the
aspect
of
the
enemy
in
this
imposing
attitude
retreated
with
backward
steps
into
the
kitchen
and
tumbled
over
a
cur
which
immediately
fastened
on
his
rear
chainmail
anxious
to
overtake
the
captain
and
curious
to
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
pocketed
the
newspaper
and
sallied
forth
leaving
harry
roaring
for
a
doctor
and
tailor
to
repair
the
lacerations
of
his
outward
man
chainmail
could
find
no
trace
of
the
captain
indeed
he
sought
him
but
in
one
direction
which
was
that
leading
to
the
farm
where
he
arrived
in
due
time
and
found
miss
susan
alone
he
laid
the
newspaper
on
the
table
as
was
his
custom
and
proceeded
to
converse
with
the
young
lady
a
conversation
of
many
pauses
as
much
of
signs
as
of
words
the
young
lady
took
up
the
paper
and
turned
it
over
and
over
while
she
listened
to
chainmail
whom
she
found
every
day
more
and
more
agreeable
when
suddenly
her
eye
glanced
on
something
which
made
her
change
colour
and
dropping
the
paper
on
the
ground
she
rose
from
her
seat
exclaiming
miserable
must
she
be
who
trusts
any
of
your
faithless
sex
never
never
never
will
i
endure
such
misery
and
she
vanished
up
the
stairs
chainmail
was
petrified
at
length
he
cried
aloud
cornelius
agrippa
must
have
laid
a
spell
on
this
accursed
newspaper
and
was
turning
it
over
to
look
for
the
source
of
the
mischief
when
ap
llymry
made
her
appearance
ap
have
you
done
to
poor
dear
miss
susan
she
is
crying
ready
to
break
her
heart
help
me
the
memory
of
richard
i
have
not
the
most
distant
notion
of
what
is
the
matter
ap
don
t
tell
me
sir
you
must
have
her
i
know
how
it
is
you
have
been
keeping
company
with
her
as
if
you
wanted
to
marry
her
and
now
all
at
once
you
have
been
insulting
her
i
have
seen
such
tricks
more
than
once
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
dear
madam
you
wrong
me
utterly
i
have
none
but
the
kindest
feelings
and
the
most
honourable
purposes
towards
her
she
has
been
disturbed
by
something
she
has
seen
in
this
rascally
paper
ap
then
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
away
and
come
again
tomorrow
i
indeed
madam
out
of
this
house
i
stir
not
till
i
have
seen
the
young
lady
and
obtained
a
full
explanation
ap
will
tell
miss
susan
what
you
say
perhaps
she
will
come
down
chainmail
sat
with
as
much
patience
as
he
could
command
running
over
the
paper
from
column
to
column
at
length
he
lighted
on
an
announcement
of
the
approaching
marriage
of
lady
clarinda
bossnowl
with
crotchet
the
younger
this
explained
the
captain
s
discomposure
but
the
cause
of
miss
susan
s
was
still
to
be
sought
he
could
not
know
that
it
was
one
and
the
same
presently
the
sound
of
the
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
the
young
lady
reappeared
and
resumed
her
seat
her
eyes
showed
that
she
had
been
weeping
the
gentleman
was
now
exceedingly
puzzled
how
to
begin
but
the
young
lady
relieved
him
by
asking
with
great
simplicity
what
do
you
wish
to
have
explained
sir
wish
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
explain
myself
to
you
yet
could
i
first
wish
to
know
what
it
was
that
disturbed
you
in
this
unlucky
paper
happy
should
i
be
if
i
could
remove
the
cause
of
your
inquietude
cause
is
already
removed
i
saw
something
that
excited
painful
recollections
nothing
that
i
could
now
wish
otherwise
than
as
it
is
may
i
ask
why
it
is
that
i
find
one
so
accomplished
living
in
this
obscurity
and
passing
only
by
the
name
of
miss
susan
world
and
my
name
are
not
friends
i
have
left
the
world
and
wish
to
remain
for
ever
a
stranger
to
all
whom
i
once
knew
in
it
can
have
done
nothing
to
dishonour
your
name
sir
my
father
has
done
that
of
which
the
world
disapproves
in
matters
of
which
i
pretend
not
to
judge
i
have
suffered
for
it
as
i
will
never
suffer
again
my
name
is
my
own
secret
i
have
no
other
and
that
is
one
not
worth
knowing
you
see
what
i
am
and
all
i
am
i
live
according
to
the
condition
of
my
present
fortune
and
here
so
living
i
have
found
tranquillity
i
entreat
you
tell
me
your
name
sir
but
to
throw
my
hand
my
heart
my
fortune
at
your
feet
my
name
be
worthy
of
them
nay
not
so
if
your
hand
and
heart
are
free
hand
and
heart
are
free
but
they
must
be
sought
from
myself
and
not
from
my
name
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
with
a
mingled
expression
of
mistrust
of
kindness
and
of
fixed
resolution
which
the
found
irresistible
from
yourself
alone
i
seek
them
you
have
prejudices
on
the
score
of
parentage
i
have
not
conversed
with
you
so
often
without
knowing
what
they
are
choose
between
them
and
me
i
too
have
my
own
prejudices
on
the
score
of
personal
pride
would
choose
you
from
all
the
world
were
you
even
the
daughter
of
the
des
hautes
as
the
heroine
of
a
romantic
story
i
once
read
turned
out
to
be
am
satisfied
you
have
now
a
right
to
know
my
history
and
if
you
repent
i
absolve
you
from
all
obligations
she
told
him
her
history
but
he
was
out
of
the
reach
of
repentance
it
is
true
as
at
a
subsequent
period
he
said
to
the
captain
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
one
who
in
the
days
of
richard
the
first
would
have
been
plucked
by
the
beard
in
the
streets
but
she
is
according
to
modern
notions
a
lady
of
gentle
blood
as
to
her
father
s
running
away
that
is
a
minor
consideration
i
have
always
understood
from
mac
quedy
who
is
a
great
oracle
in
this
way
that
promises
to
pay
ought
not
to
be
kept
the
essence
of
a
safe
and
economical
currency
being
an
interminable
series
of
broken
promises
there
seems
to
be
a
difference
among
the
learned
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
promises
ought
to
be
broken
but
i
am
not
deep
enough
in
this
casuistry
to
enter
into
such
nice
in
a
few
days
there
was
a
wedding
a
pathetic
of
the
farmer
s
family
a
hundred
kisses
from
the
bride
to
the
children
and
promises
twenty
times
reclaimed
and
renewed
to
visit
them

the
ensuing
year

this

the
occurrences
already
narrated
have
carried
it
on
to
the
middle
of
autumn
stepping
over
the

to
christmas
we
find
ourselves
in

among
the
chalk
hills
of

and
we
discover
our
old

crotchet
in
the
act

accepting
an
invitation
for
himself
and
any
friends
who
might
be
with
him
to

marched
up

out

spoons

dead
of

this
comes
of

rather
think
it
comes

poverty

robbery
perhaps
comes
of
poverty

scientific

written
a

was
assembled
on

in

comprised
all
the
guests
of
crotchet
castle
some
of
chainmail
s
other
neighbours
all
his
tenants
and
domestics
and
captain

the
hall
was
spacious
and
lofty
and
with
its
tall
fluted
pillars
and
pointed
arches
its
windows
of
stained
glass
its
display
of
arms
and
banners
intermingled
with
holly
and
mistletoe
its
blazing
cressets
and
torches
and
a
stupendous
fire
in
the
centre
on
which
blocks
of
pine
were
flaming
and
crackling
had
a
striking
effect
on
eyes
unaccustomed
to
such
a
the
fire
was
open
on
all
sides
and
the
smoke
was
caught
and
carried
back
under
a
canopy
into
a
hollow
central
pillar
this
fire
was
the
line
of
demarcation
between
gentle
and
simple
on
days
of
high
festival
tables
extended
from
it
on
two
sides
to
nearly
the
end
of
the
hall
chainmail
was
introduced
to
the
company
young
crotchet
felt
some
revulsion
of
feeling
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
one
whom
he
had
forsaken
but
not
forgotten
in
a
condition
apparently
so
much
happier
than
his
own
the
lady
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
cordial
look
of
more
than
forgiveness
it
seemed
to
say
that
she
had
much
to
thank
him
for
she
was
the
picture
of
a
happy

told
the
reverend
doctor

the
news
of
the
morning
as
you
predicted

said
your

the
learned
friend
is
in
office
he
has
also
a
title
he
is
now
sir
guy
de

for
that
he
is
disarmed
from
further
mischief
it
is
something
at
any
rate
to
have
that
hollow
and
reed
rooted
up
for
ever
from
the
field
of
public
delusion
suppose
doctor
you
do
not
like
to
see
a
great
reformer
in
office
you
are
afraid
for
your
vested
interests
rev
i
indeed
sir
my
vested
interests
are
very
safe
from
all
such
reformers
as
the
learned
friend
i
vaticinate
what
will
be
the
upshot
of
all
his
schemes
of
reform
he
will
make
a
speech
of
seven
hours
duration
and
this
will
be
its
quintessence
that
seeing
the
exceeding
difficulty
of
putting
salt
on
the
bird
s
tail
it
will
be
expedient
to
consider
the
best
method

so
i
leave
him
in

mac
quedy
came
up
to
the
divine
as
crotchet
left
him
and
said
there
is
one
piece
of
news
which
the
old
gentleman
has
not
told
you
the
great
firm
of
catchflat
and
company
in
which
young
crotchet
is
a
partner
has
stopped
rev
me
that
accounts
for
the
young
gentleman
s
melancholy
i
thought
they
would
overreach
themselves
with
their
own
tricks
the
day
of
reckoning
mac
quedy
is
the
point
which
your
science
always
leaves
out
of
view
mac
do
not
see
sir
that
the
failure
of
catchflat
and
company
has
anything
to
do
with
my
science
rev
has
this
to
do
with
it
sir
that
you
would
turn
the
whole
nation
into
a
great
shop
and
take
no
thought
of
the
day
of
reckoning
but
the
dinner
is
coming
i
think
you
who
are
so
fond
of
paper
promises
should
dine
on
the
bill
of
fare
the
harper
at
the
head
of
the
hall
struck
up
an
ancient
march
and
the
dishes
were
brought
in
in
grand
procession
the
boar
s
head
garnished
with
rosemary
with
a
citron
in
its
mouth
led
the
van
then
came
tureens
of
then
a
series
of
turkeys
and
in
the
midst
of
them
an
enormous
sausage
which
it
required
two
men
to
carry
then
came
geese
and
capons
tongues
and
hams
the
ancient
glory
of
the
christmas
pie
a
gigantic
plum
pudding
a
pyramid
of
mince
pies
and
a
baron
of
beef

up
the
rear

something
new

the
divine
as
he
sat
down
to
see
a
great
dinner

for

twelfth
century

i
prefer
our
reformed
system
of
putting
fasts
and
feasts
together
not
but
here
is
ample
indemnity
ale
and
wine
flowed
in
abundance
the
dinner
passed
off
merrily
the
old
harper
playing
all
the
while
the
oldest
music
in
his
repertory
the
tables
being
cleared
he
indemnified
himself
for
lost
time
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
in
company
with
the
old
butler
and
the
other
domestics
whose
attendance
on
the
banquet
had
been
indispensable
the
scheme
of
christmas
gambols
which
chainmail
had
laid
for
the
evening
was
interrupted
by
a
tremendous
clamour

added
approaching
the
door
of

hall
who
is
there
vociferated
the
divine
with
the
voice
of
stentor
captain

replied
a
chorus
of
discordant
voices

here

a
piece
of

dark

the
march

you
have
brought
disparates

which
your
science
upholds
putting
the
crew
on

doubling
the

the
sure
way
to
make
a

mac

i
uphold
no
such
system

that

shall
set
you
right

arises
with
the
increase
of

is
all

it
was
the
march

we
have
not
time
for
discussing
cause
and
effect
now
let
us
get
rid
of
the
enemy

vociferated
at
the
top
of
his
voice
what
do

give
them
the

an

blissful
middle
period

down

up

accinged
himself

finished
it

blanchflor
loveliest
maids
within
a
summer
grove
amid
the
shades
together
talked
of
love
a
clerk
sweet
blanchflor
s
heart
had
gain
d
fair
florence
loved
a
knight
and
each
with
ardent
voice
maintained
she
loved
the
worthiest
wight
sweet
blanchflor
praised
her
scholar
dear
as
courteous
kind
and
true
fair
florence
said
her
chevalier
could
every
foe
subdue
and
florence
scorned
the
bookworm
vain
who
sword
nor
spear
could
raise
and
blanchflor
scorned
the
unlettered
brain
could
sing
no
lady
s
praise
from
dearest
love
the
maidens
bright
to
deadly
hatred
fell
each
turned
to
shun
the
other
s
sight
and
neither
said
farewell
the
king
of
birds
who
held
his
court
within
that
flowery
grove
sang
loudly
twill
be
rare
disport
to
judge
this
suit
of
before
him
came
the
maidens
bright
with
all
his
birds
around
to
judge
the
cause
if
clerk
or
knight
in
love
be
worthiest
found
the
falcon
and
the
stood
forward
for
the
fight
ready
to
do
and
not
to
talk
they
voted
for
the
knight
and
blanchflor
s
heart
began
to
fail
till
rose
the
lark
and
after
him
the
nightingale
and
pleaded
for
the
clerk
the
nightingale
prevailed
at
length
her
pleading
had
such
charms
so
eloquence
can
conquer
strength
and
arts
can
conquer
arms
the
lovely
florence
tore
her
hair
and
died
upon
the
place
and
all
the
birds
assembled
there
bewailed
the
mournful
case
they
piled
up
leaves
and
flowerets
rare
above
the
maiden
bright
and
sang
farewell
to
florence
fair
who
too
well
loved
her
several
others

the
party

intervals

dances
chainmail
handed
to
trillo
another
ballad
of
the
twelfth
century
of
a
merrier
character
than
the
former
trillo
readily
accommodated
it
with
an
air
and
sang
the
priest
and
the
mulberry
tree
did
you
hear
of
the
curate
who
mounted
his
mare
and
merrily
trotted
along
to
the
fair
of
creature
more
tractable
none
ever
heard
in
the
height
of
her
speed
she
would
stop
at
a
word
and
again
with
a
word
when
the
curate
said
hey
she
put
forth
her
mettle
and
galloped
away
as
near
to
the
gates
of
the
city
he
rode
while
the
sun
of
september
all
brilliantly
glowed
the
good
priest
discovered
with
eyes
of
desire
a
mulberry
tree
in
a
hedge
of
wild
briar
on
boughs
long
and
lofty
in
many
a
green
shoot
hung
large
black
and
glossy
the
beautiful
fruit
the
curate
was
hungry
and
thirsty
to
boot
he
shrunk
from
the
thorns
though
he
longed
for
the
fruit
with
a
word
he
arrested
his
courser
s
keen
speed
and
he
stood
up
erect
on
the
back
of
his
steed
on
the
saddle
he
stood
while
the
creature
stood
still
and
he
gathered
the
fruit
till
he
took
his
good
fill
sure
never
he
thought
was
a
creature
so
rare
so
docile
so
true
as
my
excellent
mare
lo
here
how
i
stand
and
he
gazed
all
around
as
safe
and
as
steady
as
if
on
the
ground
yet
how
had
it
been
if
some
traveller
this
way
had
dreaming
no
mischief
but
chanced
to
cry
hey
he
stood
with
his
head
in
the
mulberry
tree
and
he
spoke
out
aloud
in
his
fond
reverie
at
the
sound
of
the
word
the
good
mare
made
a
push
and
down
went
the
priest
in
the
bush
he
remembered
too
late
on
his
thorny
green
bed
much
that
well
may
be
thought
can
not
wisely
be
said
lady
clarinda

prevailed
on
to

were
the
lovers
in
the
days
of
old
the
glance
which
she
threw
at
the
captain
as
she
sang
the
last
verse
awakened
his
dormant
hopes
looking
round
for
his
rival
he
saw
that
he
was
not
in
the
hall
and
approaching
the
lady
of
his
heart
he
received
one
of
the
sweetest
smiles
of
their
earlier
days
after
a
time
the
ladies
and
all
the
females
of
the
party
retired
the
males
remained
on
duty
with
punch
and
wassail
and
dropped
off
one
by
one
into
sweet
forgetfulness
so
that
when
the
rising
sun
of
december
looked
through
the
painted
windows
on
mouldering
embers
and
flickering
lamps
the
vaulted
roof
was
echoing
to
a
mellifluous
concert
of
noses
from
the
clarionet
of
the
at
one
end
of
the
hall
to
the
double
bass
of
the
reverend
doctor

over

conclusion
from
this
eventful
night
young
crotchet

seen
no
more

whither
he
had

was
a
question
that
could
no
more
be
answered
in
his
case
than
in
that
of

of

the
great
firm
of
catchflat
and
company
figured
in
the
gazette
and
paid
sixpence
in
the
pound
and
it
was
clear
that
he
had
shrunk
from
exhibiting
himself
on
the
scene
of
his
former
greatness
shorn
of
the
beams
of
his
paper
prosperity
some
supposed
him
to
be

among
the
undiscoverable
secrets
of
some

those
who

pride
to
allow
herself
to
be
put
up
a
second
time
in

renewed
his

her

partiality
for
