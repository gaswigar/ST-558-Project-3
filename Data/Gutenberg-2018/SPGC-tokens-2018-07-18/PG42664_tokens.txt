a
hundred
we
thank
sam
moskowitz
editor
and
sf
historian
who
showed
us
this
she
drew
away
from
him
dwindling
in
the
of
the
skies
until
she
was
a
figure
no
bigger
than
a
child
the
clangor
of
the
swords
had
died
away
the
shouting
of
the
slaughter
was
hushed
silence
lay
on
the
snow
the
pale
bleak
sun
that
glittered
so
blindingly
from
the
and
the
plains
struck
sheens
of
silver
from
rent
corselet
and
broken
blade
where
the
dead
lay
in
heaps
the
nerveless
hand
yet
gripped
the
broken
hilt
helmeted
heads
in
the
death
throes
tilted
red
beards
and
golden
beards
grimly
upward
as
if
in
last
invocation
to
ymir
the
across
the
red
drifts
and
forms
two
figures
approached
one
another
in
that
utter
desolation
only
they
moved
the
frosty
sky
was
over
them
the
white
illimitable
plain
around
them
the
dead
men
at
their
feet
slowly
through
the
corpses
they
came
as
ghosts
might
come
to
a
tryst
through
the
shambles
of
a
world
their
shields
were
gone
their
corselets
dinted
blood
smeared
their
mail
their
swords
were
red
their
horned
helmets
showed
the
marks
of
fierce
strokes
one
spoke
he
whose
locks
and
beard
were
red
as
the
blood
on
the
sunlit
snow
man
of
the
raven
locks
said
he
tell
me
your
name
so
that
my
brothers
in
vanaheim
may
know
who
was
the
last
of
wulfhere
band
to
fall
before
the
sword
of
heimdul
this
is
my
answer
replied
the
warrior
not
in
vanaheim
but
in
valhalla
will
you
tell
your
brothers
the
name
of
amra
of
akbitana
heimdul
roared
and
sprang
and
his
sword
swung
in
a
mighty
arc
amra
staggered
and
his
vision
was
filled
with
red
sparks
as
the
blade
shivered
into
bits
of
blue
fire
on
his
helmet
but
as
he
reeled
he
thrust
with
all
the
power
of
his
great
shoulders
the
sharp
point
drove
through
brass
scales
and
bones
and
heart
and
the
warrior
died
at
amra
feet
amra
stood
swaying
trailing
his
sword
a
sudden
sick
weariness
assailing
him
the
glare
of
the
sun
on
the
snow
cut
his
eyes
like
a
knife
and
the
sky
seemed
shrunken
and
strangely
far
he
turned
away
from
the
trampled
expanse
where
warriors
lay
locked
with
slayers
in
the
embrace
of
death
a
few
steps
he
took
and
the
glare
of
the
snow
fields
was
suddenly
dimmed
a
rushing
wave
of
blindness
engulfed
him
and
he
sank
down
into
the
snow
supporting
himself
on
one
mailed
arm
seeking
to
shake
the
blindness
out
of
his
eyes
as
a
lion
might
shake
his
mane
a
silvery
laugh
cut
through
his
dizziness
and
his
sight
cleared
slowly
there
was
a
strangeness
about
all
the
landscape
that
he
could
not
place
or
define
an
unfamiliar
tinge
to
earth
and
sky
but
he
did
not
think
long
of
this
before
him
swaying
like
a
sapling
in
the
wind
stood
a
woman
her
body
was
like
ivory
and
save
for
a
veil
of
gossamer
she
was
naked
as
the
day
her
slender
bare
feet
were
whiter
than
the
snow
they
spurned
she
laughed
and
her
laughter
was
sweeter
than
the
rippling
of
silvery
fountains
and
poisonous
with
cruel
mockery
who
are
you
demanded
the
warrior
what
matter
her
voice
was
more
musical
than
a
harp
but
it
was
edged
with
cruelty
call
up
your
men
he
growled
grasping
his
sword
though
my
strength
fail
me
yet
they
shall
not
take
me
alive
i
see
that
you
are
of
the
vanir
have
i
said
so
he
looked
again
at
her
unruly
locks
which
he
had
thought
to
be
red
now
he
saw
that
they
were
neither
red
nor
yellow
but
a
glorious
compound
of
both
colors
he
gazed
her
hair
was
like
striking
which
the
sun
dazzled
him
her
eyes
were
neither
wholly
blue
nor
wholly
grey
but
of
shifting
colors
and
dancing
lights
and
clouds
of
colors
he
could
not
recognize
her
full
red
lips
smiled
and
from
her
slim
feet
to
the
blinding
crown
of
her
billowy
hair
her
ivory
body
was
as
perfect
as
the
dream
of
a
god
amra
pulse
hammered
in
his
temples
i
can
not
tell
said
he
whether
you
are
of
vanaheim
and
mine
enemy
or
of
asgard
and
my
friend
far
have
i
wandered
from
zingara
to
the
sea
of
vilayet
in
stygia
and
kush
and
the
country
of
the
hyrkanians
but
a
woman
like
you
i
have
never
seen
your
locks
blind
me
with
their
brightness
not
even
among
the
fairest
daughters
of
the
aesir
have
i
seen
such
hair
by
ymir
who
are
you
to
swear
by
ymir
she
mocked
what
know
you
of
the
gods
of
ice
and
snow
you
who
have
come
up
from
the
south
to
adventure
among
strangers
by
the
dark
gods
of
my
own
race
he
cried
in
anger
have
i
been
backward
in
the
stranger
or
no
this
day
i
have
seen
four
score
warriors
fall
and
i
alone
survive
the
field
where
reavers
met
the
men
of
bragi
tell
me
woman
have
you
caught
the
flash
of
mail
across
the
or
seen
armed
men
moving
upon
the
ice
i
have
seen
the
glittering
in
the
sun
she
answered
i
have
heard
the
wind
whispering
across
the
everlasting
snows
he
shook
his
head
niord
should
have
come
up
with
us
before
the
battle
joined
i
fear
he
and
his
warriors
have
been
ambushed
wulfhere
lies
dead
with
all
his
i
had
thought
there
was
no
village
within
many
leagues
of
this
spot
for
the
war
carried
us
far
but
you
can
have
come
no
great
distance
over
these
snows
naked
as
you
are
lead
me
to
your
tribe
if
you
are
of
asgard
for
i
am
faint
with
the
weariness
of
strife
my
dwelling
place
is
further
than
you
can
walk
amra
of
akbitana
she
laughed
spreading
wide
her
arms
she
swayed
before
him
her
golden
head
lolling
wantonly
her
scintillant
eyes
shadowed
beneath
long
silken
lashes
am
i
not
beautiful
man
like
dawn
running
naked
on
the
snows
he
muttered
his
eyes
burning
like
those
of
a
wolf
then
why
do
you
not
rise
and
follow
me
who
is
the
strong
warrior
who
falls
down
before
me
she
chanted
in
maddening
mockery
lie
down
and
die
in
the
snow
with
the
other
fools
amra
of
the
black
hair
you
can
not
follow
where
i
would
lead
with
an
oath
the
man
heaved
himself
upon
his
feet
his
blue
eyes
blazing
his
dark
scarred
face
convulsed
rage
shook
his
soul
but
desire
for
the
taunting
figure
before
him
hammered
at
his
temples
and
drove
his
wild
blood
riotously
through
his
veins
passion
fierce
as
physical
agony
flooded
his
whole
being
so
that
earth
and
sky
swam
red
to
his
dizzy
gaze
and
weariness
and
faintness
were
swept
from
him
in
madness
he
spoke
no
word
as
he
drove
at
her
fingers
hooked
like
talons
with
a
shriek
of
laughter
she
leaped
back
and
ran
laughing
at
him
over
her
white
shoulder
with
a
low
growl
amra
followed
he
had
forgotten
the
fight
forgotten
the
mailed
warriors
who
lay
in
their
blood
forgotten
niord
belated
reavers
he
had
thought
only
for
the
slender
white
shape
which
seemed
to
float
rather
than
run
before
him
out
across
the
white
blinding
plain
she
led
him
the
trampled
red
field
fell
out
of
sight
behind
him
but
still
amra
kept
on
with
the
silent
tenacity
of
his
race
his
mailed
feet
broke
through
the
frozen
crust
he
sank
deep
in
the
drifts
and
forged
through
them
by
sheer
strength
but
the
girl
danced
across
the
snow
as
light
as
a
feather
floating
across
a
pool
her
naked
feet
scarcely
left
their
imprint
on
the
in
spite
of
the
fire
in
his
veins
the
cold
bit
through
the
warrior
mail
and
furs
but
the
girl
in
her
gossamer
veil
ran
as
lightly
and
as
gaily
as
if
she
danced
through
the
palms
and
rose
gardens
of
poitain
black
curses
drooled
through
the
warrior
parched
lips
the
great
veins
swelled
and
throbbed
in
his
temples
and
his
teeth
gnashed
spasmodically
you
can
not
escape
me
he
roared
lead
me
into
a
trap
and
i
pile
the
heads
of
your
kinsmen
at
your
feet
hide
from
me
and
i
tear
apart
the
mountains
to
find
you
i
follow
you
to
hell
and
beyond
hell
her
maddening
laughter
floated
back
to
him
and
foam
flew
from
the
warrior
lips
further
and
further
into
the
wastes
she
led
him
till
he
saw
the
wide
plains
give
way
to
low
hills
marching
upward
in
broken
ranges
far
to
the
north
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
towering
mountains
blue
with
the
distance
or
white
with
the
eternal
snows
above
these
mountains
shone
the
flaring
rays
of
the
borealis
they
spread
into
the
sky
frosty
blades
of
cold
flaming
light
changing
in
color
growing
and
brightening
above
him
the
skies
glowed
and
crackled
with
strange
lights
and
gleams
the
snow
shone
weirdly
now
frosty
blue
now
icy
crimson
now
cold
silver
through
a
shimmering
icy
realm
of
enchantment
amra
plunged
doggedly
onward
in
a
crystaline
maze
where
the
only
reality
was
the
white
body
dancing
across
the
glittering
snow
beyond
his
reach
ever
beyond
his
reach
yet
he
did
not
wonder
at
the
necromantic
strangeness
of
it
all
not
even
when
two
gigantic
figures
rose
up
to
bar
his
way
the
scales
of
their
mail
were
white
with
their
helmets
and
their
axes
were
sheathed
in
ice
snow
sprinkled
their
locks
in
their
beards
were
spikes
of
icicles
their
eyes
were
cold
as
the
lights
that
streamed
above
them
brothers
cried
the
girl
dancing
between
them
look
who
follows
i
have
brought
you
a
man
for
the
feasting
take
his
heart
that
we
may
lay
it
smoking
on
our
father
board
the
giants
answered
with
roars
like
the
grinding
of
on
a
frozen
shore
and
heaved
up
their
shining
axes
as
the
maddened
akbitanan
hurled
himself
upon
them
a
frosty
blade
flashed
before
his
eyes
blinding
him
with
its
brightness
and
he
gave
back
a
terrible
stroke
that
sheared
through
his
foe
thigh
with
a
groan
the
victim
fell
and
at
the
instant
amra
was
dashed
into
the
snow
his
left
shoulder
numb
from
the
blow
of
the
survivor
from
which
the
warrior
mail
had
barely
saved
his
life
amra
saw
the
remaining
giant
looming
above
him
like
a
colossus
carved
of
ice
etched
against
the
glowing
sky
the
axe
fell
to
sink
through
the
snow
and
deep
into
the
frozen
earth
as
amra
hurled
himself
aside
and
leaped
to
his
feet
the
giant
roared
and
wrenched
the
free
but
even
as
he
did
so
amra
sword
sang
down
the
giant
knees
bent
and
he
sank
slowly
into
the
snow
which
turned
crimson
with
the
blood
that
gushed
from
his
neck
amra
wheeled
to
see
the
girl
standing
a
short
distance
away
staring
in
horror
all
mockery
gone
from
her
face
he
cried
out
fiercely
and
the
flew
from
his
sword
as
his
hand
shook
in
the
intensity
of
his
passion
call
the
rest
of
your
brothers
he
roared
call
the
dogs
i
give
their
hearts
to
the
wolves
with
a
cry
of
fright
she
turned
and
fled
she
did
not
laugh
now
nor
mock
him
over
her
shoulder
she
ran
as
for
her
life
and
though
he
strained
every
nerve
and
thew
until
his
temples
were
like
to
burst
and
the
snow
swam
red
to
his
gaze
she
drew
away
from
him
dwindling
in
the
of
the
skies
until
she
was
a
figure
no
bigger
than
a
child
then
a
dancing
white
flame
on
the
snow
then
a
dim
blur
in
the
distance
but
grinding
his
teeth
until
the
blood
started
from
his
gums
he
reeled
on
and
he
saw
the
blur
grow
to
a
dancing
white
flame
and
then
she
was
running
less
than
a
hundred
paces
ahead
of
him
and
slowly
the
space
narrowed
foot
by
foot
she
was
running
with
effort
now
her
golden
locks
blowing
free
he
heard
the
quick
panting
of
her
breath
and
saw
a
flash
of
fear
in
the
look
she
cast
over
her
alabaster
shoulder
the
grim
endurance
of
the
warrior
had
served
him
well
the
speed
ebbed
from
her
flashing
white
legs
she
reeled
in
her
gait
in
his
untamed
soul
flamed
up
the
fires
of
hell
she
had
fanned
so
well
with
an
inhuman
roar
he
closed
in
on
her
just
as
she
wheeled
with
a
haunting
cry
and
flung
out
her
arms
to
fend
him
off
his
sword
fell
into
the
snow
as
he
crushed
her
to
him
her
supple
body
bent
backward
as
she
fought
with
desperate
frenzy
in
his
iron
arms
her
golden
hair
blew
about
his
face
blinding
him
with
its
sheen
the
feel
of
her
slender
figure
twisting
in
his
mailed
arms
drove
him
to
blinder
madness
his
strong
fingers
sank
deep
into
her
smooth
flesh
and
that
flesh
was
cold
as
ice
it
was
as
if
he
embraced
not
a
woman
of
human
flesh
and
blood
but
a
woman
of
flaming
ice
she
writhed
her
golden
head
aside
striving
to
avoid
the
savage
kisses
that
bruised
her
red
lips
you
are
cold
as
the
snows
he
mumbled
dazedly
i
will
warm
you
with
the
fire
in
my
own
blood
with
a
desperate
wrench
she
twisted
from
his
arms
leaving
her
single
gossamer
garment
in
his
grasp
she
sprang
back
and
faced
him
her
golden
locks
in
wild
disarray
her
white
bosom
heaving
her
beautiful
eyes
blazing
with
terror
for
an
instant
he
stood
frozen
awed
by
her
terrible
beauty
as
she
posed
naked
against
the
snows
and
in
that
instant
she
flung
her
arms
toward
the
lights
that
glowed
in
the
skies
above
her
and
cried
out
in
a
voice
that
rang
in
amra
ears
for
ever
after
oh
my
father
save
me
amra
was
leaping
forward
arms
spread
to
seize
her
when
with
a
crack
like
the
breaking
of
an
ice
mountain
the
whole
skies
leaped
into
icy
fire
the
girl
ivory
body
was
suddenly
enveloped
in
a
cold
blue
flame
so
blinding
that
the
warrior
threw
up
his
hands
to
shield
his
eyes
a
fleeting
instant
skies
and
snowy
hills
were
bathed
in
crackling
white
flames
blue
darts
of
icy
light
and
frozen
crimson
fires
then
amra
staggered
and
cried
out
the
girl
was
gone
the
glowing
snow
lay
empty
and
bare
high
above
him
the
flashed
and
played
in
a
frosty
sky
gone
mad
and
among
the
distant
blue
mountains
there
sounded
a
rolling
thunder
as
of
a
gigantic
rushing
behind
steeds
whose
frantic
hoofs
struck
lightning
from
the
snows
and
echoes
from
the
skies
then
suddenly
the
borealis
the
snowy
hills
and
the
blazing
heavens
reeled
drunkenly
to
amra
sight
thousands
of
fireballs
burst
with
showers
of
sparks
and
the
sky
itself
became
a
titanic
wheel
which
rained
stars
as
it
spun
under
his
feet
the
snowy
hills
heaved
up
like
a
wave
and
the
akbitanan
crumpled
into
the
snows
to
lie
motionless
in
a
cold
dark
universe
whose
sun
was
extinguished
eons
ago
amra
felt
the
movement
of
life
alien
and
an
earthquake
had
him
in
its
grip
and
was
shaking
him
to
and
fro
at
the
same
time
chafing
his
hands
and
feet
until
he
yelled
in
pain
and
fury
and
groped
for
his
sword
he
coming
to
horsa
grunted
a
voice
haste
we
must
rub
the
frost
out
of
his
limbs
if
he
ever
to
wield
sword
again
he
wo
open
his
left
hand
growled
another
his
voice
indicating
muscular
strain
he
clutching
something
amra
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
into
the
bearded
faces
that
bent
over
him
he
was
surrounded
by
tall
warriors
in
mail
and
furs
amra
you
live
by
crom
niord
gasped
he
am
i
alive
or
are
we
all
dead
and
in
valhalla
we
live
grunted
the
aesir
busy
over
amra
feet
we
had
to
fight
our
way
through
an
ambush
else
we
had
come
up
with
you
before
the
battle
was
joined
the
corpses
were
scarce
cold
when
we
came
upon
the
field
we
did
not
find
you
among
the
dead
so
we
followed
your
spoor
in
ymir
name
amra
why
did
you
wander
off
into
the
wastes
of
the
north
we
have
followed
your
tracks
in
the
snow
for
hours
had
a
blizzard
come
up
and
hidden
them
we
had
never
found
you
by
ymir
swear
not
so
often
by
ymir
muttered
a
warrior
glancing
at
the
distant
mountains
this
is
his
land
and
the
god
bides
among
yonder
mountains
the
legends
say
i
followed
a
woman
amra
answered
hazily
we
met
bragi
men
in
the
plains
i
know
not
how
long
we
fought
i
alone
lived
i
was
dizzy
and
faint
the
land
lay
like
a
dream
before
me
only
now
do
all
things
seem
natural
and
familiar
the
woman
came
and
taunted
me
she
was
beautiful
as
a
frozen
flame
from
hell
when
i
looked
at
her
i
was
as
one
mad
and
forgot
all
else
in
the
world
i
followed
her
did
you
not
find
her
tracks
or
the
giants
in
icy
mail
i
slew
niord
shook
his
head
we
found
only
your
tracks
in
the
snow
amra
then
it
may
be
i
was
mad
said
amra
dazedly
yet
you
yourself
are
no
more
real
to
me
than
was
the
golden
haired
witch
who
fled
naked
across
the
snows
before
me
yet
from
my
very
hands
she
vanished
in
icy
flame
he
is
delirious
whispered
a
warrior
not
so
cried
an
older
man
whose
eyes
were
wild
and
weird
it
was
atali
the
daughter
of
ymir
the
to
fields
of
the
dead
she
comes
and
shows
herself
to
the
dying
myself
when
a
boy
i
saw
her
when
i
lay
on
the
bloody
field
of
wolraven
i
saw
her
walk
among
the
dead
in
the
snows
her
naked
body
gleaming
like
ivory
and
her
golden
hair
like
a
blinding
flame
in
the
moonlight
i
lay
and
howled
like
a
dying
dog
because
i
could
not
crawl
after
her
she
lures
men
from
stricken
fields
into
the
wastelands
to
be
slain
by
her
brothers
the
who
lay
men
red
hearts
smoking
on
ymir
board
amra
has
seen
atali
the
daughter
bah
grunted
horsa
old
gorm
mind
was
turned
in
his
youth
by
a
sword
cut
on
the
head
amra
was
delirious
with
the
fury
of
battle
look
how
his
helmet
is
dinted
any
of
those
blows
might
have
addled
his
brain
it
was
an
hallucination
he
followed
into
the
wastes
he
is
from
the
south
what
does
he
know
of
atali
you
speak
truth
perhaps
muttered
amra
it
was
all
strange
and
weird
by
crom
he
broke
off
glaring
at
the
object
that
still
dangled
from
his
clenched
left
fist
the
others
gaped
silently
at
the
veil
he
held
up
a
wisp
of
gossamer
that
was
never
spun
by
human
distaff
