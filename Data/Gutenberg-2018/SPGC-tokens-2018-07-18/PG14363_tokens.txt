published
printed

this
volume
is
a
narrative
of
scott
last
expedition
from
its
departure
from
england
in
to
its
return
to
new
zealand
in
it
does
not
however
include
the
story
of
subsidiary
parties
except
where
their
adventures
touch
the
history
of
the
main
party
it
is
hoped
later
to
publish
an
appendix
volume
with
an
account
of
the
two
geological
journeys
and
such
other
information
concerning
the
equipment
of
and

learned
by
this

may
be
of

future
explorer
apsley
preface
this
business
is
inartistic
for
it
is
seldom
that
any
one
does
anything
well
for
the
sake
of
doing
it
well
and
it
is
if
you
value
christianity
for
men
are
out
to
hurt
and
not
to
help
can
you
wonder
when
the
ten
commandments
were
hurled
straight
from
the
pulpit
through
good
stained
glass
it
is
all
very
interesting
and
uncomfortable
and
it
has
been
a
great
relief
to
wander
back
in
one
thoughts
and
correspondence
and
personal
dealings
to
an
age
in
geological
time
so
many
hundred
years
ago
when
we
were
artistic
christians
doing
our
jobs
as
well
as
we
were
able
just
because
we
wished
to
do
them
well
helping
one
another
with
all
our
strength
and
i
speak
with
personal
humility
living
a
life
of
in
the
face
of
hardships
and
dangers
which
has
seldom
been
surpassed
the
mutual
conquest
of
difficulties
is
the
cement
of
friendship
as
it
is
the
only
lasting
cement
of
matrimony
we
had
plenty
of
difficulties
we
sometimes
failed
we
sometimes
won
we
always
faced
them
we
had
to
consequently
we
have
some
friends
who
are
better
than
all
the
wives
in
mahomet
paradise
and
when
i
have
asked
for
help
in
the
making
of
this
book
i
have
never
never
asked
in
vain
talk
of
give
me
unsoured
and
with
their
ideals
intact
they
could
sweep
the
world
the
trouble
is
that
they
are
inclined
to
lose
their
ideals
in
this
complicated
atmosphere
of
civilization
they
run
one
another
down
like
the
deuce
and
it
is
quite
time
that
stopped
what
is
the
use
of
a
running
down
scott
because
he
served
with
shackleton
or
b
going
for
amundsen
because
he
served
with
scott
they
have
all
done
good
work
within
their
limits
the
best
work
to
date
there
are
jobs
for
which
if
i
had
to
do
them
i
would
like
to
serve
under
scott
amundsen
shackleton
and
wilson
each
to
his
part
for
a
joint
scientific
and
geographical
piece
of
organization
give
me
scott
for
a
winter
journey
wilson
for
a
dash
to
the
pole
and
nothing
else
amundsen
and
if
i
am
in
the
devil
of
a
hole
and
want
to
get
out
of
it
give
me
shackleton
every
time
they
will
all
go
down
in
polar
history
as
leaders
these
men
i
believe
bowers
would
also
have
made
a
great
name
for
himself
if
he
had
lived
and
few
polar
ships
have
been
commanded
as
capably
as
was
the
terra
nova
by
pennell
in
a
way
this
book
is
a
sequel
to
the
friendship
which
there
was
between
wilson
bowers
and
myself
which
having
stood
the
strain
of
the
winter
journey
could
never
have
been
broken
between
the
three
of
us
we
had
a
share
in
all
the
big
journeys
and
bad
times
which
came
to
scott
main
landing
party
and
what
follows
is
particularly
our
unpublished
diaries
letters
and
illustrations
i
we
have
tried
to
show
how
good
the
whole
thing
was
and
how
bad
i
have
had
a
freer
hand
than
many
in
this
because
much
of
the
dull
routine
has
been
recorded
already
and
can
be
found
if
wanted
also
because
not
being
the
leader
of
the
expedition
i
had
no
duty
to
fulfil
in
cataloguing
my
followers
achievements
but
there
was
plenty
of
work
left
for
me
it
has
been
no
mere
gleaning
of
the
polar
field
not
half
the
story
had
been
told
nor
even
all
the
most
interesting
documents
among
these
i
have
had
from
bowers
her
letters
home
and
from
lashly
his
diary
of
the
last
return
party
on
the
polar
journey
wilson
has
given
her
husband
diary
of
the
polar
journey
this
is
especially
valuable
because
it
is
the
only
detailed
account
in
existence
from
to
the
pole
and
after
with
the
exception
of
scott
diary
already
published
lady
scott
has
given
with
both
hands
any
records
i
wanted
and
could
find
no
one
of
my
companions
in
the
south
has
failed
to
help
they
include
atkinson
wright
priestley
simpson
lillie
and
debenham
to
all
these
good
friends
i
can
do
no
more
than
express
my
very
sincere
thanks
i
determined
that
the
first
object
of
the
illustrations
should
be
descriptive
of
the
text
wright
and
debenham
have
photographs
sledging
and
otherwise
which
do
this
admirably
wilson
has
allowed
me
to
have
any
of
her
husband
sketches
and
drawings
reproduced
that
i
wished
and
there
are
many
hundreds
from
which
to
make
a
selection
in
addition
to
the
six
which
i
have
chosen
for
their
beauty
i
have
taken
a
number
of
sketches
because
they
illustrate
typical
incidents
in
our
lives
they
are
just
unfinished
sketches
no
more
and
had
bill
been
alive
he
would
have
finished
them
before
he
allowed
them
to
be
published
then
i
have
had
reproduced
nearly
all
the
sketches
and
panoramas
drawn
by
him
on
the
polar
journey
and
found
with
him
where
he
died
the
process
does
not
do
them
justice
i
wish
i
could
have
had
them
reproduced
in
photogravure
but
the
cost
is
prohibitive
as
to
production
after
a
good
deal
of
experience
i
was
convinced
that
i
could
trust
a
commercial
firm
to
do
its
worst
save
when
it
gave
them
less
trouble
to
do
better
i
acknowledge
my
mistake
in
a
wilderness
of
firms
in
whom
nothing
was
first
class
except
their
names
and
their
prices
i
have
dealt
with
clark
who
have
printed
this
book
and
emery
walker
who
has
illustrated
it
the
fact
that
emery
walker
is
not
only
alive
but
full
of
vitality
indicates
why
most
of
the
other
firms
are
millionaires
when
i
went
south
i
never
meant
to
write
a
book
i
rather
despised
those
who
did
so
as
being
of
an
inferior
brand
to
those
who
did
things
and
said
nothing
about
them
but
that
they
say
nothing
is
too
often
due
to
the
fact
that
they
have
nothing
to
say
or
are
too
idle
or
too
busy
to
learn
how
to
say
it
every
one
who
has
been
through
such
an
extraordinary
experience
has
much
to
say
and
ought
to
say
it
if
he
has
any
faculty
that
way
there
is
after
the
event
a
good
deal
of
criticism
of
of
checking
of
supplies
and
distances
and
so
forth
that
can
not
really
be
done
without
experience
out
there
we
knew
what
was
happening
to
us
too
well
but
we
did
not
and
could
not
measure
its
full
significance
when
i
was
asked
to
write
a
book
by
the
antarctic
committee
i
discovered
that
without
knowing
it
i
had
intended
to
write
one
ever
since
i
had
realized
my
own
experiences
once
started
i
enjoyed
the
process
my
own
writing
is
my
own
despair
but
it
is
better
than
it
was
and
this
is
directly
due
to
and
bernard
shaw
at
the
age
of
i
am
delighted
to
acknowledge
that
my
education
has
at
last
begun

the

introduction
polar
exploration
is
at
once
the
cleanest
and
most
isolated
way
of
having
a
bad
time
which
has
been
devised
it
is
the
only
form
of
adventure
in
which
you
put
on
your
clothes
at
michaelmas
and
keep
them
on
until
christmas
and
save
for
a
layer
of
the
natural
grease
of
the
body
find
them
as
clean
as
though
they
were
new
it
is
more
lonely
than
london
more
secluded
than
any
monastery
and
the
post
comes
but
once
a
year
as
men
will
compare
the
hardships
of
france
palestine
or
mesopotamia
so
it
would
be
interesting
to
contrast
the
rival
claims
of
the
antarctic
as
a
medium
of
discomfort
a
member
of
campbell
party
tells
me
that
the
trenches
at
ypres
were
a
comparative
picnic
but
until
somebody
can
evolve
a
standard
of
endurance
i
am
unable
to
see
how
it
can
be
done
take
it
all
in
all
i
do
not
believe
anybody
on
earth
has
a
worse
time
than
an
emperor
penguin
even
now
the
antarctic
is
to
the
rest
of
the
earth
as
the
abode
of
the
gods
was
to
the
ancient
chaldees
a
precipitous
and
mammoth
land
lying
far
beyond
the
seas
which
encircled
man
habitation
and
nothing
is
more
striking
about
the
exploration
of
the
southern
polar
regions
than
its
absence
for
when
king
alfred
reigned
in
england
the
vikings
were
navigating
the
of
the
north
yet
when
wellington
fought
the
battle
of
waterloo
there
was
still
an
undiscovered
continent
in
the
south
for
those
who
wish
to
read
an
account
of
the
history
of
antarctic
exploration
there
is
an
excellent
chapter
in
scott
voyage
of
the
discovery
and
elsewhere
i
do
not
propose
to
give
any
general
survey
of
this
kind
here
but
complaints
have
been
made
to
me
that
scott
last
expedition
plunges
the
general
reader
into
a
neighbourhood
which
he
is
supposed
to
know
all
about
while
actually
he
is
lost
having
no
idea
what
the
discovery
was
or
where
castle
rock
or
hut
point
stand
for
the
better
understanding
of
the
references
to
particular
expeditions
to
the
lands
discovered
by
them
and
the
traces
left
by
them
which
must
occur
in
this
book
i
give
the
following
brief
introduction
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
making
of
maps
of
the
southern
hemisphere
it
was
supposed
that
there
was
a
great
continent
called
terra
australis
as
explorers
penetrated
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
cape
horn
and
found
nothing
but
stormy
oceans
beyond
and
as
later
they
discovered
australia
and
new
zealand
the
belief
in
this
continent
weakened
but
was
not
abandoned
during
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
eagerness
for
scientific
knowledge
was
added
to
the
former
striving
after
individual
or
state
aggrandizement
cook
ross
and
scott
these
are
the
aristocrats
of
the
south
it
was
the
great
english
navigator
james
cook
who
laid
the
foundations
of
our
knowledge
in
he
sailed
from
deptford
in
the
resolution
tons
and
the
adventure
tons
ships
which
had
been
built
at
whitby
for
the
coal
trade
he
was
like
nansen
a
believer
in
a
varied
diet
as
one
of
the
preventives
of
scurvy
and
mentions
that
he
had
among
his
provisions
besides
saur
krout
portable
broth
marmalade
of
carrots
and
suspissated
juice
of
wort
and
beer
medals
were
struck
to
be
given
to
the
natives
of
new
discovered
countries
and
left
there
as
testimonies
of
our
being
the
first
discoverers
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
whether
any
exist
now
after
calling
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
cook
started
to
make
his
easting
down
to
new
zealand
purposing
to
sail
as
far
south
as
possible
in
search
of
a
southern
continent
he
sighted
his
first
island
or
iceberg
in
lat
long
on
december
the
next
day
he
saw
some
white
birds
about
the
size
of
pigeons
with
blackish
bills
and
feet
i
never
saw
any
such
before
these
must
have
been
snowy
petrel
passing
through
many
bergs
where
he
notices
how
the
albatross
left
them
and
penguins
appeared
he
was
brought
up
by
thick
pack
ice
along
which
he
coasted
under
the
supposition
that
this
ice
was
formed
in
bays
and
rivers
cook
was
led
to
believe
that
land
was
not
far
distant
incidentally
he
remarks
that
in
order
to
enable
his
men
to
support
the
colder
weather
he
caused
the
sleeves
of
their
jackets
which
were
so
short
as
to
expose
their
arms
to
be
lengthened
with
baize
and
had
a
cap
made
for
each
man
of
the
same
stuff
together
with
canvas
which
proved
of
great
service
to
them
for
more
than
a
month
cook
sailed
the
southern
ocean
always
among
bergs
and
often
among
pack
the
weather
was
consistently
bad
and
generally
thick
he
mentions
that
he
had
only
seen
the
moon
once
since
leaving
the
cape
it
was
on
sunday
january
that
the
antarctic
circle
was
crossed
for
the
first
time
in
longitude
after
proceeding
to
latitude
he
was
stopped
by
an
immense
field
of
pack
from
this
point
he
turned
back
and
made
his
way
to
new
zealand
leaving
new
zealand
at
the
end
of
without
his
second
ship
the
adventure
from
which
he
had
been
parted
he
judged
from
the
great
swell
that
there
can
be
no
land
to
the
southward
under
the
meridian
of
new
zealand
but
what
must
lie
very
far
to
the
south
in
latitude
he
sighted
the
first
ice
island
on
december
and
was
stopped
by
thick
pack
ice
three
days
later
on
the
he
again
crossed
the
antarctic
circle
in
longitude
and
penetrated
in
this
neighbourhood
to
a
latitude
of
here
he
found
a
drift
towards
the
on
january
in
longitude
he
crossed
the
antarctic
circle
for
the
third
time
after
meeting
no
pack
and
only
a
few
icebergs
in
latitude
he
was
finally
turned
back
by
an
immense
field
of
pack
and
wrote
i
will
not
say
it
was
impossible
anywhere
to
get
farther
to
the
south
but
the
attempting
it
would
have
been
a
dangerous
and
rash
enterprise
and
what
i
believe
no
man
in
my
situation
would
have
thought
of
it
was
indeed
my
opinion
as
well
as
the
opinion
of
most
on
board
that
this
ice
extended
quite
to
the
pole
or
perhaps
joined
to
some
land
to
which
it
had
been
fixed
from
the
earliest
time
and
that
it
is
here
that
is
to
the
south
of
this
parallel
where
all
the
ice
we
find
scattered
up
and
down
to
the
north
is
first
formed
and
afterwards
broken
off
by
gales
of
wind
or
other
causes
and
brought
to
the
north
by
the
currents
which
are
always
found
to
set
in
that
direction
in
the
high
latitudes
as
we
drew
near
this
ice
some
penguins
were
heard
but
none
seen
and
but
few
other
birds
or
any
other
thing
that
could
induce
us
to
think
any
land
was
near
and
yet
i
think
there
must
be
some
to
the
south
beyond
this
ice
but
if
there
is
it
can
afford
no
better
retreat
for
birds
or
any
other
animals
than
the
ice
itself
with
which
it
must
be
wholly
covered
i
who
had
ambition
not
only
to
go
farther
than
any
one
had
been
before
but
as
far
as
it
was
possible
for
man
to
go
was
not
sorry
at
meeting
with
this
interruption
as
it
in
some
measure
relieved
us
at
least
shortened
the
dangers
and
hardships
inseparable
from
the
navigation
of
the
southern
polar
regions
and
so
he
turned
northwards
when
being
taken
ill
of
the
bilious
colic
a
favourite
dog
belonging
to
one
of
the
officers
forster
after
whom
aptenodytes
forsteri
the
emperor
penguin
is
named
fell
a
sacrifice
to
my
tender
stomach
thus
i
received
nourishment
and
strength
from
food
which
would
have
made
most
people
in
europe
sick
so
true
it
is
that
necessity
is
governed
by
no
law
once
and
for
all
the
idea
of
a
populous
fertile
southern
continent
was
proved
to
be
a
myth
and
it
was
clearly
shown
that
whatever
land
might
exist
to
the
south
must
be
a
region
of
desolation
hidden
beneath
a
mantle
of
ice
and
snow
the
vast
extent
of
the
tempestuous
southern
seas
was
revealed
and
the
limits
of
the
habitable
globe
were
made
known
incidentally
it
may
be
remarked
that
cook
was
the
first
to
describe
the
peculiarities
of
the
antarctic
icebergs
and
a
russian
expedition
under
bellingshausen
discovered
the
first
certain
land
in
the
antarctic
in
and
called
it
alexander
land
which
lies
nearly
due
south
of
cape
horn
whatever
may
have
been
the
rule
in
other
parts
of
the
world
the
flag
followed
trade
in
the
southern
seas
during
the
first
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
discovery
of
large
numbers
of
seals
and
whales
attracted
many
hundreds
of
ships
and
it
is
to
the
enlightened
instructions
of
such
firms
as
enderby
and
to
the
pluck
and
enterprise
of
such
commanders
as
weddell
biscoe
and
balleny
that
we
owe
much
of
our
small
knowledge
of
the
outline
of
the
antarctic
continent
in
the
smallest
and
craziest
ships
they
plunged
boldly
into
stormy
seas
again
and
again
they
narrowly
missed
disaster
their
vessels
were
racked
and
strained
and
leaked
badly
their
crews
were
worn
out
with
unceasing
toil
and
decimated
with
scurvy
yet
in
spite
of
inconceivable
discomforts
they
struggled
on
and
it
does
not
appear
that
any
one
of
them
ever
turned
his
course
until
he
was
driven
to
do
so
by
hard
necessity
one
can
not
read
the
simple
unaffected
narratives
of
these
voyages
without
being
assured
of
their
veracity
and
without
being
struck
by
the
wonderful
pertinacity
and
courage
which
they
display
the
position
in
was
that
the
antarctic
land
had
been
sighted
at
a
few
points
all
round
its
coasts
on
the
whole
the
boundaries
which
had
been
seen
lay
on
or
close
to
the
antarctic
circle
and
it
appeared
probable
that
the
continent
if
continent
it
was
consisted
of
a
great
circular
mass
of
land
with
the
south
pole
at
its
centre
and
its
coasts
more
or
less
equidistant
from
this
point
two
exceptions
only
to
this
had
been
found
cook
and
bellingshausen
had
indicated
a
dip
towards
the
pole
south
of
the
pacific
weddell
a
still
more
pronounced
dip
to
the
south
of
the
atlantic
having
sailed
to
a
latitude
of
in
longitude
had
there
been
a
tetrahedronal
theory
in
those
days
some
one
might
have
suggested
the
probability
of
a
third
indentation
beneath
the
indian
ocean
probably
to
be
laughed
at
for
his
pains
when
james
clark
ross
started
from
england
in
there
was
no
particular
reason
for
him
to
suppose
that
the
antarctic
in
the
region
of
the
magnetic
pole
which
he
was
to
try
to
reach
did
not
continue
to
follow
the
antarctic
circle
ross
left
england
in
september
under
instructions
from
the
admiralty
he
had
under
his
command
two
of
her
majesty
sailing
ships
the
erebus
tons
and
the
terror
tons
arriving
in
hobart
tasmania
in
august
he
was
met
by
news
of
discoveries
made
during
the
previous
summer
by
the
french
expedition
under
dumont
and
the
united
states
expedition
under
charles
wilkes
the
former
had
coasted
along
adélie
land
and
for
sixty
miles
of
ice
cliff
to
the
west
of
it
he
brought
back
an
egg
now
at
drayton
which
scott
discovery
expedition
definitely
proved
to
be
that
of
an
emperor
penguin
all
these
discoveries
were
somewhere
about
the
latitude
of
the
antarctic
circle
and
roughly
in
that
part
of
the
world
which
lies
to
the
south
of
australia
ross
impressed
with
the
feeling
that
england
had
ever
the
way
of
discovery
in
the
southern
as
well
as
in
the
northern
region
resolved
at
once
to
avoid
all
interference
with
their
discoveries
and
selected
a
much
more
easterly
meridian
on
which
to
penetrate
to
the
southward
and
if
possible
reach
the
magnetic
pole
the
outlines
of
the
expedition
in
which
an
unknown
and
unexpected
sea
was
found
stretching
miles
southwards
towards
the
pole
are
well
known
to
students
of
antarctic
history
after
passing
through
the
pack
he
stood
towards
the
supposed
position
of
the
magnetic
pole
steering
as
nearly
south
by
the
compass
as
the
wind
admitted
and
on
january
in
latitude
he
sighted
the
white
peaks
of
mount
sabine
and
shortly
afterwards
cape
adare
foiled
by
the
presence
of
land
from
gaining
the
magnetic
pole
he
turned
southwards
true
into
what
is
now
called
the
ross
sea
and
after
spending
many
days
in
travelling
down
this
with
the
mountains
on
his
right
hand
the
ross
sea
on
his
left
he
discovered
and
named
the
great
line
of
mountains
which
here
for
some
five
hundred
miles
divides
the
sea
from
the
antarctic
plateau
on
january
with
a
favourable
breeze
and
very
clear
weather
we
stood
to
the
southward
close
to
some
land
which
had
been
in
sight
since
the
preceding
noon
and
which
we
then
called
the
high
island
it
proved
to
be
a
mountain
twelve
thousand
four
hundred
feet
of
elevation
above
the
level
of
the
sea
emitting
flame
and
smoke
in
great
profusion
at
first
the
smoke
appeared
like
snowdrift
but
as
we
drew
nearer
its
true
character
became
manifest
i
named
it
mount
erebus
and
an
extinct
volcano
to
the
eastward
little
inferior
in
height
being
by
measurement
ten
thousand
nine
hundred
feet
high
was
called
mount
terror
that
is
the
first
we
hear
of
our
two
old
friends
and
ross
island
is
the
land
upon
which
they
stand
as
we
approached
the
land
under
all
we
perceived
a
low
white
line
extending
from
its
eastern
extreme
point
as
far
as
the
eye
could
discern
to
the
eastward
it
presented
an
extraordinary
appearance
gradually
increasing
in
height
as
we
got
nearer
to
it
and
proving
at
length
to
be
a
perpendicular
cliff
of
ice
between
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
two
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
perfectly
flat
and
level
at
the
top
and
without
any
fissures
or
promontories
on
its
even
seaward
face
ross
coasted
along
the
barrier
for
some
miles
from
cape
crozier
as
he
called
the
eastern
extremity
of
ross
island
after
the
commander
of
the
terror
this
point
where
land
sea
and
moving
barrier
meet
will
be
constantly
mentioned
in
this
narrative
returning
he
looked
into
the
sound
which
divides
ross
island
from
the
western
mountains
on
february
mount
erebus
was
seen
at
and
the
weather
becoming
very
clear
we
had
a
splendid
view
of
the
whole
line
of
coast
to
all
appearance
connecting
it
with
the
main
land
which
we
had
not
before
suspected
to
be
the
case
the
reader
will
understand
that
ross
makes
a
mistake
here
since
mounts
erebus
and
terror
are
upon
an
island
connected
to
the
mainland
only
by
a
sheet
of
ice
he
continues
a
very
deep
bight
was
observed
to
extend
far
to
the
from
cape
bird
bird
was
the
senior
lieutenant
of
the
erebus
in
which
a
line
of
low
land
might
be
seen
but
its
determination
was
too
uncertain
to
be
left
unexplored
and
as
the
wind
blowing
feebly
from
the
west
prevented
our
making
any
way
in
that
direction
through
the
young
ice
that
now
covered
the
surface
of
the
ocean
in
every
part
as
far
as
we
could
see
from
the
i
determined
to
steer
towards
the
bight
to
give
it
a
closer
examination
and
to
learn
with
more
certainty
its
continuity
or
otherwise
at
noon
we
were
in
latitude
longitude
dip
and
variation
during
the
afternoon
we
were
nearly
becalmed
and
witnessed
some
magnificent
eruptions
of
mount
erebus
the
flame
and
smoke
being
projected
to
a
great
height
but
we
could
not
as
on
a
former
occasion
discover
any
lava
issuing
from
the
crater
although
the
exhibitions
of
were
upon
a
much
grander
scale
soon
after
midnight
february
a
breeze
sprang
up
from
the
eastward
and
we
made
all
sail
to
the
southward
until
although
we
had
an
hour
before
distinctly
traced
the
land
entirely
round
the
bay
connecting
mount
erebus
with
the
mainland
i
named
it
mcmurdo
bay
after
the
senior
lieutenant
of
the
terror
a
compliment
that
his
zeal
and
skill
well
merited
it
is
now
called
mcmurdo
sound
in
making
the
mistake
of
connecting
erebus
with
the
mainland
ross
was
looking
at
a
distance
upon
the
hut
point
peninsula
running
out
from
the
corner
of
erebus
towards
the
west
he
probably
saw
minna
bluff
which
juts
out
from
the
mainland
towards
the
east
between
them
and
in
front
of
the
bluff
lie
white
island
black
island
and
brown
island
to
suppose
them
to
be
part
of
a
line
of
continuous
land
was
a
very
natural
mistake
ross
broke
through
the
pack
ice
into
an
unknown
sea
he
laid
down
many
hundreds
of
miles
of
mountainous
and
with
further
work
completed
in
some
miles
of
the
great
ice
barrier
he
penetrated
in
his
ships
to
the
extraordinarily
high
latitude
of
four
degrees
farther
than
weddell
the
scientific
work
of
his
expedition
was
no
less
worthy
of
praise
the
south
magnetic
pole
was
fixed
with
comparative
accuracy
though
ross
was
disappointed
in
his
natural
but
perhaps
too
ambitious
hope
i
had
so
long
cherished
of
being
permitted
to
plant
the
flag
of
my
country
on
both
the
magnetic
poles
of
our
globe
before
all
things
he
was
at
great
pains
to
be
accurate
both
in
his
geographical
and
scientific
observations
and
his
records
of
meteorology
water
temperatures
soundings
as
also
those
concerning
the
life
in
the
oceans
through
which
he
passed
were
not
only
frequent
but
trustworthy
when
ross
returned
to
england
in
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
that
the
case
of
those
who
advocated
the
existence
of
a
south
polar
continent
was
considerably
strengthened
at
the
same
time
there
was
no
proof
that
the
various
blocks
of
land
which
had
been
discovered
were
connected
with
one
another
even
now
in
after
twenty
years
of
determined
exploration
aided
by
the
most
modern
appliances
the
interior
of
this
supposed
continent
is
entirely
unknown
and
uncharted
except
in
the
ross
sea
area
while
the
fringes
of
the
land
are
only
discovered
in
perhaps
a
dozen
places
on
a
circumference
of
about
eleven
thousand
miles
in
his
life
of
sir
joseph
hooker
leonard
huxley
has
given
us
some
interesting
sidelights
on
this
expedition
under
ross
hooker
was
the
botanist
of
the
expedition
and
assistant
surgeon
to
the
erebus
being
years
old
when
he
left
england
in
natural
history
came
off
very
badly
in
the
matter
of
equipment
from
the
government
who
provided
reams
of
paper
two
botanizing
vascula
and
two
cases
for
bringing
home
live
plants
that
was
all
not
an
instrument
nor
a
book
nor
a
bottle
and
rum
from
the
ship
stores
was
the
only
preservative
and
when
they
returned
the
rich
collections
which
they
brought
back
were
never
fully
worked
out
ross
special
branch
of
science
was
terrestrial
magnetism
but
he
was
greatly
interested
in
natural
history
and
gave
up
part
of
his
cabin
for
hooker
to
work
in
almost
every
day
i
draw
sometimes
all
day
long
and
till
two
and
three
in
the
morning
the
captain
directing
me
he
sits
on
one
side
of
the
table
writing
and
figuring
at
night
and
i
on
the
other
drawing
every
now
and
then
he
breaks
off
and
comes
to
my
side
to
see
what
i
am
after
and
as
you
may
suppose
we
have
had
one
or
two
little
tiffs
neither
of
us
perhaps
being
helped
by
the
best
of
tempers
but
nothing
can
exceed
the
liberality
with
which
he
has
thrown
open
his
cabin
to
me
and
made
it
my
workroom
at
no
little
inconvenience
to
himself
another
extract
from
hooker
letters
after
the
first
voyage
runs
as
follows
the
success
of
the
expedition
in
geographical
discovery
is
really
wonderful
and
only
shows
what
a
little
perseverance
will
do
for
we
have
been
in
no
dangerous
predicaments
and
have
suffered
no
hardships
whatever
there
has
been
a
sort
of
freemasonry
among
polar
voyagers
to
keep
up
the
credit
they
have
acquired
as
having
done
wonders
and
accordingly
such
of
us
as
were
new
to
the
ice
made
up
our
minds
for
and
attached
a
most
undue
importance
to
the
simple
operation
of
boring
packs
which
have
now
vanished
though
i
am
not
going
to
tell
everybody
so
i
do
not
here
refer
to
travellers
who
do
indeed
undergo
hardships
but
to
voyagers
who
have
a
snug
ship
a
little
knowledge
of
the
ice
and
due
caution
is
all
that
is
required
in
the
light
of
scott
leading
of
the
expedition
of
which
i
am
about
to
tell
and
the
extraordinary
scientific
activity
of
pennell
in
command
of
the
terra
nova
after
scott
was
landed
hooker
would
have
to
qualify
a
later
extract
nor
is
it
probable
that
any
future
collector
will
have
a
captain
so
devoted
to
the
cause
of
marine
zoology
and
so
constantly
on
the
alert
to
snatch
the
most
trifling
opportunities
of
adding
to
the
collection
finally
we
have
a
picture
of
the
secrecy
which
was
imposed
upon
all
with
regard
to
the
news
they
should
write
home
and
the
precautions
against
any
leakage
of
scientific
results
and
we
see
hooker
jumping
down
the
main
hatch
with
a
penguin
skin
in
his
hand
which
he
was
preparing
for
himself
when
ross
came
up
the
after
hatch
unexpectedly
that
happened
on
the
terra
nova
ross
had
a
cold
reception
on
his
return
and
scott
wrote
to
hooker
in
at
first
it
seems
inexplicable
when
one
considers
how
highly
his
work
is
now
appreciated
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
general
public
however
i
have
always
thought
that
ross
was
neglected
and
as
you
once
said
he
is
very
far
from
doing
himself
justice
in
his
book
i
did
not
know
that
barrow
was
the
bête
noire
who
did
so
much
to
discount
ross
results
it
is
an
interesting
sidelight
on
such
a
venture
in
discussing
and
urging
the
importance
of
the
antarctic
expedition
which
was
finally
sent
under
scott
in
the
discovery
hooker
urged
the
importance
of
work
in
the
south
polar
ocean
which
swarms
with
animal
and
vegetable
life
commenting
upon
the
fact
that
the
large
collections
made
chiefly
by
himself
had
never
been
worked
out
except
the
diatoms
he
writes
a
better
fate
i
trust
awaits
the
treasures
that
the
expedition
will
bring
back
for
so
prolific
is
the
ocean
that
the
naturalist
need
never
be
idle
no
not
even
for
one
of
the
hours
of
daylight
during
a
whole
antarctic
summer
and
i
look
to
the
results
of
a
comparison
of
the
oceanic
life
of
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
as
the
heralding
of
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
biology
when
ross
went
to
the
antarctic
it
was
generally
thought
that
there
was
neither
food
nor
oxygen
nor
light
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
life
among
other
things
the
investigations
of
ross
gave
ground
for
thinking
this
was
not
the
case
later
still
in
the
possibility
of
laying
submarine
cables
made
it
necessary
to
investigate
the
nature
of
the
abyssal
depths
and
the
challenger
proved
that
not
only
does
life
and
in
quite
high
forms
exist
there
but
that
there
are
fish
which
can
see
it
is
now
almost
certain
that
there
is
a
great
oxidized
current
which
flows
out
of
the
antarctic
ocean
and
under
the
waters
of
the
other
great
oceans
of
the
world
it
was
the
good
fortune
of
ross
at
a
time
when
the
fringes
of
the
great
antarctic
continent
were
being
discovered
in
comparatively
low
latitudes
of
and
thereabouts
sometimes
not
even
within
the
antarctic
circle
to
find
to
the
south
of
new
zealand
a
deep
inlet
in
which
he
could
sail
to
the
high
latitude
of
this
inlet
which
is
now
known
as
the
ross
sea
has
formed
the
of
all
sledging
parties
which
have
approached
the
south
pole
i
have
dwelt
upon
this
description
of
the
lands
he
discovered
because
they
will
come
very
intimately
into
this
history
i
have
also
emphasized
his
importance
in
the
history
of
antarctic
exploration
because
ross
having
done
what
it
was
possible
to
do
by
sea
penetrating
so
far
south
and
making
such
memorable
discoveries
the
next
necessary
step
in
antarctic
exploration
was
that
another
traveller
should
follow
up
his
work
on
land
it
is
an
amazing
thing
that
sixty
years
were
allowed
to
elapse
before
that
traveller
appeared
when
he
appeared
he
was
scott
in
the
sixty
years
which
elapsed
between
ross
and
scott
the
map
of
the
antarctic
remained
practically
unaltered
scott
tackled
the
land
and
scott
is
the
father
of
antarctic
sledge
travelling
this
period
of
time
saw
a
great
increase
in
the
interest
taken
in
science
both
pure
and
applied
and
it
had
been
pointed
out
in
that
we
knew
more
about
the
planet
mars
than
about
a
large
area
of
our
own
globe
the
challenger
expedition
of
had
spent
three
weeks
within
the
antarctic
circle
and
the
specimens
brought
home
by
her
from
the
depths
of
these
cold
seas
had
aroused
curiosity
meanwhile
borchgrevink
landed
at
cape
adare
and
built
a
hut
which
still
stands
and
which
afforded
our
cape
adare
party
valuable
assistance
here
he
lived
during
the
first
winter
which
men
spent
in
the
antarctic
meanwhile
in
the
arctic
brave
work
was
being
done
the
names
of
parry
franklin
markham
nares
greely
and
de
long
are
but
a
few
of
the
many
which
suggest
themselves
of
those
who
have
fought
their
way
mile
by
mile
over
rough
ice
and
open
leads
with
appliances
which
now
seem
to
be
primitive
and
with
an
addition
to
knowledge
which
often
seemed
hardly
commensurate
with
the
hardships
suffered
and
the
disasters
which
sometimes
overtook
them
to
those
whose
fortune
it
has
been
to
serve
under
scott
the
franklin
expedition
has
more
than
ordinary
interest
for
it
was
the
same
ships
the
erebus
and
terror
which
discovered
ross
island
that
were
crushed
in
the
northern
ice
after
franklin
himself
had
died
and
it
was
captain
crozier
the
same
crozier
who
was
ross
captain
in
the
south
and
after
whom
cape
crozier
is
named
who
then
took
command
and
led
that
most
ghastly
journey
in
all
the
history
of
exploration
more
we
shall
never
know
for
none
survived
to
tell
the
tale
now
with
the
noise
and
racket
of
london
all
round
them
a
statue
of
scott
looks
across
to
one
of
franklin
and
his
men
of
the
erebus
and
terror
and
surely
they
have
some
thoughts
in
common
englishmen
had
led
the
way
in
the
north
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
finest
journey
of
all
was
made
by
the
norwegian
nansen
in
believing
in
a
drift
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
new
siberian
islands
westwards
over
the
pole
a
theory
which
obtained
confirmation
by
the
discovery
off
the
coast
of
greenland
of
certain
remains
of
a
ship
called
the
jeannette
which
had
been
crushed
in
the
ice
off
these
islands
his
bold
project
was
to
be
frozen
in
with
his
ship
and
allow
the
current
to
take
him
over
or
as
near
as
possible
to
the
pole
for
this
purpose
the
most
famous
of
arctic
ships
was
built
called
the
fram
she
was
designed
by
colin
archer
and
was
with
a
breadth
of
her
total
length
with
most
of
the
expert
arctic
opinion
against
him
nansen
believed
that
this
ship
would
rise
and
sit
on
the
top
of
the
ice
when
pressed
instead
of
being
crushed
of
her
wonderful
voyage
with
her
thirteen
men
of
how
she
was
frozen
into
the
ice
in
september
in
the
north
of
siberia
and
of
the
heaving
and
trembling
of
the
ship
amidst
the
roar
of
the
ice
pressure
of
how
the
fram
rose
to
the
occasion
as
she
was
built
to
do
the
story
has
still
after
years
the
thrill
of
novelty
she
drifted
over
the
eightieth
degree
on
february
during
the
first
winter
nansen
was
already
getting
restive
the
drift
was
so
slow
and
sometimes
it
was
backwards
it
was
not
until
the
second
autumn
that
the
degree
arrived
so
he
decided
that
he
would
make
an
attempt
to
penetrate
northwards
by
sledging
during
the
following
spring
as
nansen
has
told
me
he
felt
that
the
ship
would
do
her
job
in
any
case
could
not
something
more
be
done
also
this
was
one
of
the
bravest
decisions
a
polar
explorer
has
ever
taken
it
meant
leaving
a
drifting
ship
which
could
not
be
regained
it
meant
a
return
journey
over
drifting
ice
to
land
the
nearest
known
land
was
nearly
five
hundred
miles
south
of
the
point
from
which
he
started
northwards
and
the
journey
would
include
travelling
both
by
sea
and
by
ice
undoubtedly
there
was
more
risk
in
leaving
the
fram
than
in
remaining
in
her
it
is
a
laughable
absurdity
to
say
as
greely
did
after
almost
miraculous
return
that
he
had
deserted
his
men
in
an
ship
and
deserved
to
be
censured
for
doing
so
the
ship
was
left
in
the
command
of
sverdrup
johansen
was
chosen
to
be
nansen
one
companion
and
we
shall
hear
of
him
again
in
the
fram
this
time
with
amundsen
in
his
voyage
to
the
south
the
polar
traveller
is
so
interested
in
the
adventure
and
hardships
of
nansen
sledge
journey
that
his
equipment
which
is
the
most
important
side
of
his
expedition
to
us
who
have
gone
south
is
liable
to
be
overlooked
the
modern
side
of
polar
travel
begins
with
nansen
it
was
nansen
who
first
used
a
light
sledge
based
upon
the
ski
sledge
of
norway
in
place
of
the
old
english
heavy
sledge
which
was
based
upon
the
eskimo
type
cooking
apparatus
food
tents
clothing
and
the
thousand
and
one
details
of
equipment
without
which
no
journey
nowadays
stands
much
chance
of
success
all
date
back
to
nansen
in
the
immediate
past
though
beyond
him
of
course
is
the
experience
of
centuries
of
travellers
as
nansen
himself
wrote
of
the
english
polar
men
how
well
was
their
equipment
thought
out
and
arranged
with
the
means
they
had
at
their
disposal
truly
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
most
of
what
i
prided
myself
upon
and
what
i
thought
to
be
new
i
find
they
had
anticipated
used
the
same
things
forty
years
ago
it
was
not
their
fault
that
they
were
born
in
a
country
where
the
use
of
snowshoes
is
unknown
all
the
more
honour
to
the
men
who
dared
so
much
and
travelled
so
far
with
the
limited
equipment
of
the
past
the
real
point
for
us
is
that
just
as
scott
is
the
father
of
antarctic
sledge
travelling
so
nansen
may
be
considered
the
modern
father
of
it
all
nansen
and
johansen
started
on
march
when
the
fram
was
in
latitude
and
the
sun
had
only
returned
a
few
days
before
with
three
sledges
two
of
which
carried
kayaks
and
dogs
they
reached
their
camp
on
april
which
nansen
has
given
in
his
book
as
being
in
latitude
but
nansen
tells
me
that
professor
geelmuyden
who
had
his
astronomical
results
and
his
diary
reckoned
that
owing
to
refraction
the
horizon
was
lifted
and
if
so
the
observation
had
to
be
reduced
accordingly
nansen
therefore
gave
the
reduced
latitude
in
his
book
but
he
considers
that
his
horizon
was
very
clear
when
he
took
that
observation
and
believes
that
his
latitude
was
higher
than
that
given
he
used
a
sextant
and
the
natural
horizon
they
turned
and
travelling
back
round
ice
and
open
leads
they
failed
to
find
the
land
they
had
been
led
to
expect
in
latitude
which
indeed
was
proved
to
be
at
the
end
of
june
they
started
using
the
kayaks
which
needed
many
repairs
after
their
rough
passage
to
cross
the
open
leads
they
waited
long
in
camp
that
the
travelling
conditions
might
improve
and
all
the
time
nansen
saw
a
white
spot
he
thought
was
cloud
at
last
on
july
land
was
in
sight
which
proved
to
be
that
white
spot
fourteen
days
later
they
reached
it
to
find
that
it
consisted
of
a
series
of
islands
these
they
left
behind
them
and
unable
to
say
what
land
they
had
reached
for
their
watches
had
run
down
they
coasted
on
westwards
and
southwards
until
winter
approached
they
built
a
hut
of
moss
and
stones
and
snow
and
roofed
it
with
walrus
skins
cut
from
the
animals
while
they
lay
in
the
sea
for
they
were
too
heavy
for
two
men
to
drag
on
to
the
ice
when
i
met
nansen
he
had
forgotten
all
about
this
and
would
not
believe
that
it
had
happened
until
he
saw
it
in
his
own
book
they
lay
in
their
old
clothes
that
winter
so
soaked
with
blubber
that
the
only
way
to
clean
their
shirts
was
to
scrape
them
they
made
themselves
new
clothes
from
blankets
and
from
the
skins
of
the
bears
which
they
ate
and
started
again
in
may
of
the
following
year
to
make
spitzbergen
they
had
been
travelling
a
long
month
during
which
time
they
had
at
least
two
very
narrow
escapes
the
first
due
to
their
kayaks
floating
away
when
nansen
swam
out
into
the
icy
sea
and
reached
them
just
before
he
sank
and
johansen
passed
the
worst
moments
of
his
life
watching
from
the
shore
the
second
caused
by
the
attack
of
a
walrus
which
went
for
nansen
kayak
with
tusks
and
flippers
and
then
one
morning
as
he
looked
round
at
the
cold
glaciers
and
naked
cliffs
not
knowing
where
he
was
he
heard
a
dog
bark
intensely
excited
he
started
towards
the
sound
to
be
met
by
the
leader
of
the
english
expedition
whose
party
was
wintering
there
and
who
first
gave
him
the
definite
news
that
he
was
on
franz
josef
land
nansen
and
johansen
were
finally
landed
at
vardo
in
the
north
of
norway
to
learn
that
no
tidings
had
yet
been
heard
of
the
fram
that
very
day
she
cleared
the
ice
which
had
imprisoned
her
for
nearly
three
years
i
can
not
go
into
the
fram
journey
save
to
say
that
she
had
drifted
as
far
north
as
only
eighteen
geographical
miles
south
of
nansen
farthest
north
but
the
sledge
journey
and
the
winter
spent
by
the
two
men
has
many
points
in
common
with
the
experience
of
our
own
northern
party
and
often
and
often
during
the
long
winter
of
our
thoughts
turned
with
hope
to
nansen
winter
for
we
said
if
it
had
been
done
once
why
should
it
not
be
done
again
and
campbell
and
his
men
survive
before
nansen
started
the
spirit
of
adventure
which
has
always
led
men
into
the
unknown
combined
with
the
increased
interest
in
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
to
turn
the
thoughts
of
the
civilized
world
southwards
it
was
becoming
plain
that
a
continent
of
the
extent
and
climate
which
this
polar
land
probably
possessed
might
have
an
overwhelming
influence
upon
the
weather
conditions
of
the
whole
southern
hemisphere
the
importance
of
magnetism
was
only
rivalled
by
the
mystery
in
which
the
whole
subject
was
shrouded
and
the
region
which
surrounded
the
southern
magnetic
pole
of
the
earth
offered
a
promising
field
of
experiment
and
observation
the
past
history
through
the
ages
of
this
land
was
of
obvious
importance
to
the
geological
story
of
the
earth
whilst
the
survey
of
land
formations
and
ice
action
in
the
antarctic
was
more
useful
perhaps
to
the
physiographer
than
that
of
any
other
country
in
the
world
seeing
that
he
found
here
in
daily
and
even
hourly
operation
the
conditions
which
he
knew
had
existed
in
the
ice
ages
of
the
past
over
the
whole
world
but
which
he
could
only
infer
from
vestigial
remains
the
biological
importance
of
the
antarctic
might
be
of
the
first
magnitude
in
view
of
the
significance
which
attaches
to
the
life
of
the
sea
in
the
evolutionary
problem
and
it
was
with
these
objects
and
ideals
that
scott
first
expedition
known
officially
as
the
british
antarctic
expedition
of
but
more
familiarly
as
discovery
expedition
from
the
name
of
the
ship
which
carried
it
was
organized
by
the
royal
society
and
the
royal
geographical
society
backed
by
the
active
support
of
the
british
government
the
executive
officers
and
crew
were
royal
navy
almost
without
exception
whilst
the
scientific
purposes
of
the
expedition
were
served
in
addition
by
five
scientists
these
latter
were
not
naval
officers
the
discovery
left
new
zealand
on
christmas
eve
and
entered
the
belt
of
pack
ice
which
always
has
to
be
penetrated
in
order
to
reach
the
comparatively
open
sea
beyond
when
just
past
the
antarctic
circle
but
a
little
more
than
four
days
saw
her
through
in
which
she
was
lucky
as
we
now
know
scott
landed
at
cape
adare
and
then
coasted
down
the
western
coast
of
victoria
land
just
as
ross
had
done
sixty
years
before
as
he
voyaged
south
he
began
to
look
for
safe
winter
quarters
for
the
ship
and
when
he
pushed
into
mcmurdo
sound
on
january
it
seemed
that
here
he
might
find
both
a
sheltered
bay
into
which
the
ship
could
be
frozen
and
a
road
to
the
southland
beyond
the
open
season
which
still
remained
before
the
freezing
of
the
sea
made
progress
impossible
was
spent
in
surveying
the
miles
of
cliff
which
marks
the
northern
limit
of
the
great
ice
barrier
passing
the
extreme
eastward
position
reached
by
ross
in
they
sailed
on
into
an
unknown
world
and
discovered
a
deep
bay
called
balloon
bight
where
the
rounded
slopes
undoubtedly
were
land
and
not
as
heretofore
floating
ice
farther
east
as
they
sailed
shallow
soundings
and
gentle
snow
slopes
gave
place
to
steeper
and
more
broken
ridges
until
at
last
small
black
patches
in
the
snow
gave
undoubted
evidence
of
rock
and
an
undiscovered
land
now
known
as
king
edward
vii
land
rose
to
a
height
of
several
thousand
feet
the
presence
of
thick
pack
ahead
and
the
advance
of
the
season
led
scott
to
return
to
mcmurdo
sound
where
he
anchored
the
discovery
in
a
little
bay
at
the
end
of
the
tongue
of
land
now
known
as
the
hut
point
peninsula
and
built
the
hut
which
though
little
used
in
the
discovery
days
was
to
figure
so
largely
in
the
story
of
this
his
last
expedition
the
first
autumn
was
spent
in
various
short
journeys
of
discovery
discovery
not
only
of
the
surrounding
land
but
of
many
mistakes
in
sledging
equipment
and
routine
it
is
amazing
to
one
who
looks
back
upon
these
first
efforts
of
the
discovery
expedition
that
the
results
were
not
more
disastrous
than
was
actually
the
case
when
one
reads
of
which
refused
to
start
of
pemmican
which
was
considered
to
be
too
rich
to
eat
of
two
officers
discussing
the
ascent
of
erebus
and
back
in
one
day
and
of
sledging
parties
which
knew
neither
how
to
use
their
cookers
or
lamp
nor
how
to
put
up
their
tents
nor
even
how
to
put
on
their
clothes
then
one
begins
to
wonder
that
the
process
of
education
was
gained
at
so
small
a
price
not
a
single
article
of
the
outfit
had
been
tested
and
amid
the
general
ignorance
that
prevailed
the
lack
of
system
was
painfully
apparent
in
everything
this
led
to
a
tragedy
a
returning
sledge
party
of
men
was
overtaken
by
a
blizzard
on
the
top
of
the
peninsula
near
castle
rock
they
quite
properly
camped
and
should
have
been
perfectly
comfortable
lying
in
their
after
a
hot
meal
but
the
primus
lamps
could
not
be
lighted
and
as
they
sat
in
leather
boots
and
inadequate
clothing
being
continually
they
decided
to
leave
the
tent
and
make
their
way
to
the
ship
sheer
madness
as
we
now
know
as
they
groped
their
way
in
the
howling
the
majority
of
the
party
either
slipped
or
rolled
down
a
steep
slippery
snow
slope
some
thousand
feet
high
ending
in
a
precipitous
below
which
lay
the
open
sea
it
is
a
nasty
place
on
a
calm
summer
day
in
a
blizzard
it
must
be
ghastly
yet
only
one
man
named
vince
shot
down
the
slope
and
over
the
precipice
into
the
sea
below
how
the
others
got
back
heaven
knows
one
seaman
called
hare
who
separated
from
the
others
and
lay
down
under
a
rock
awoke
after
hours
covered
with
snow
but
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
and
free
from
the
little
cross
at
hut
point
commemorates
the
death
of
vince
one
of
this
party
was
a
seaman
called
wild
who
came
to
the
front
and
took
the
lead
of
five
of
the
survivors
after
the
death
of
vince
he
was
to
take
the
lead
often
in
future
expeditions
under
shackleton
and
mawson
and
there
are
few
men
living
who
have
so
proved
themselves
as
polar
travellers
i
have
dwelt
upon
this
side
of
the
early
sledging
deficiencies
of
the
discovery
to
show
the
importance
of
experience
in
antarctic
land
travelling
whether
it
be
at
first
or
second
hand
scott
and
his
men
in
were
pioneers
they
bought
their
experience
at
a
price
which
might
easily
have
been
higher
and
each
expedition
which
has
followed
has
added
to
the
fund
the
really
important
thing
is
that
nothing
of
what
is
gained
should
be
lost
it
is
one
of
the
main
objects
of
this
book
to
hand
on
as
complete
a
record
as
possible
of
the
methods
equipment
food
and
weights
used
by
scott
last
expedition
for
the
use
of
future
explorers
the
first
object
of
writing
an
account
of
a
polar
voyage
is
the
guidance
of
future
voyagers
the
first
duty
of
the
writer
is
to
his
successors
the
adaptability
invention
and
resource
of
the
men
of
the
discovery
when
they
set
to
work
after
the
failures
of
the
autumn
to
prepare
for
the
successes
of
the
two
following
summers
showed
that
they
could
rise
to
their
difficulties
scott
admitted
that
food
clothing
everything
was
wrong
the
whole
system
was
bad
in
determining
to
profit
by
his
mistakes
and
working
out
a
complete
system
of
antarctic
travel
he
was
at
his
best
and
it
was
after
a
winter
of
drastic
reorganization
that
he
started
on
november
on
his
first
southern
journey
with
two
companions
wilson
and
shackleton
it
is
no
part
of
my
job
to
give
an
account
of
this
journey
the
dogs
failed
badly
probably
the
norwegian
which
had
been
brought
through
the
tropics
to
feed
them
was
tainted
at
any
rate
they
sickened
and
before
the
journey
was
done
all
the
dogs
had
to
be
killed
or
had
died
a
fortnight
after
starting
the
party
was
relaying
that
is
taking
on
part
of
their
load
and
returning
for
the
rest
and
this
had
to
be
continued
for
days
illustration
the
last
of
the
dogs
wilson
del
the
ration
of
food
was
inadequate
and
they
became
very
hungry
as
time
went
on
but
it
was
not
until
december
that
wilson
disclosed
to
scott
that
shackleton
had
signs
of
scurvy
which
had
been
present
for
some
time
on
december
in
latitude
they
decided
to
return
by
the
middle
of
january
the
scurvy
signs
were
largely
increased
and
shackleton
was
seriously
ill
and
spitting
blood
his
condition
became
more
and
more
alarming
and
he
collapsed
on
january
but
revived
afterwards
sometimes
walking
by
the
sledge
sometimes
being
carried
upon
it
shackleton
survived
scott
and
wilson
saved
his
life
the
three
men
reached
the
ship
on
february
after
covering
statute
miles
in
days
scott
and
wilson
were
both
extremely
exhausted
and
seriously
affected
by
scurvy
it
was
a
fine
journey
the
geographical
results
of
which
comprised
the
survey
of
some
three
hundred
miles
of
new
and
a
further
knowledge
of
the
barrier
upon
which
they
travelled
while
scott
was
away
southwards
an
organized
attempt
was
made
to
discover
the
nature
of
the
mountains
and
glaciers
which
lay
across
the
sound
to
the
west
this
party
actually
reached
the
plateau
which
lay
beyond
and
attained
a
height
of
feet
when
as
far
as
they
could
see
in
every
direction
to
the
westward
of
them
there
extended
a
level
plateau
to
the
south
and
north
could
be
seen
isolated
nunataks
and
behind
them
showed
the
high
mountains
which
they
had
passed
a
practicable
road
to
the
west
had
been
found
i
need
note
no
more
than
these
two
most
important
of
the
many
journeys
carried
out
this
season
nor
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
give
any
account
of
the
continuous
and
fertile
scientific
work
which
was
accomplished
in
this
virgin
land
in
the
meantime
a
relief
ship
the
morning
had
arrived
it
was
intended
that
the
discovery
should
return
this
year
as
soon
as
the
in
which
she
was
imprisoned
should
break
up
and
set
her
free
as
february
passed
however
it
became
increasingly
plain
that
the
ice
conditions
were
altogether
different
from
those
of
the
previous
year
on
the
the
morning
was
still
separated
from
the
discovery
by
eight
miles
of
fast
ice
march
was
fully
late
for
a
ship
to
remain
in
the
sound
and
on
this
date
the
morning
left
by
march
all
hope
of
the
discovery
being
freed
that
year
was
abandoned
the
second
winter
passed
much
as
the
first
and
as
soon
as
spring
arrived
sledging
was
continued
these
spring
journeys
on
the
barrier
with
sunlight
only
by
day
and
low
temperatures
at
all
times
entailed
great
discomfort
and
perhaps
worse
want
of
sleep
and
a
fast
accumulation
of
moisture
in
all
one
clothing
and
in
the
which
resulted
in
masses
of
ice
which
had
to
be
thawed
out
by
the
heat
of
one
body
before
any
degree
of
comfort
could
be
gained
a
fortnight
was
considered
about
the
extreme
limit
of
time
for
such
a
journey
and
generally
parties
were
not
absent
so
long
for
at
this
time
a
spring
journey
was
considered
a
dreadful
experience
wait
till
you
had
a
spring
journey
was
the
threat
of
the
old
stagers
to
us
a
winter
journey
lasting
nearly
three
times
as
long
as
a
spring
journey
was
not
imagined
i
advise
explorers
to
be
content
with
imagining
it
in
the
future
the
hardest
journey
of
this
year
was
carried
out
by
scott
with
two
seamen
of
whom
much
will
be
written
in
this
history
their
names
are
edgar
evans
and
lashly
the
object
of
the
journey
was
to
explore
westwards
into
the
interior
of
the
plateau
by
way
of
the
ferrar
glacier
they
reached
the
after
considerable
troubles
not
the
least
of
which
was
the
loss
of
the
data
necessary
for
navigation
contained
in
an
excellent
publication
called
hints
to
travellers
which
was
blown
away
then
for
the
first
time
it
was
seen
what
additional
difficulties
are
created
by
the
climate
and
position
of
this
lofty
plateau
which
we
now
know
extends
over
the
pole
and
probably
reaches
over
the
greater
part
of
the
antarctic
continent
it
was
the
beginning
of
november
that
is
the
beginning
of
summer
but
the
conditions
of
work
were
much
the
same
as
those
found
during
the
spring
journeys
on
the
barrier
the
temperature
dropped
into
the
minus
forties
but
the
worst
feature
of
all
was
a
continuous
blowing
from
west
to
east
which
combined
with
the
low
temperature
and
rarefied
air
to
make
the
conditions
of
sledging
extremely
laborious
the
supporting
party
returned
and
the
three
men
continued
alone
pulling
out
westwards
into
an
unknown
waste
of
snow
with
no
landmarks
to
vary
the
rough
monotony
they
turned
homewards
on
december
but
found
the
pulling
very
heavy
and
their
difficulties
were
increased
by
their
ignorance
of
their
exact
position
the
few
glimpses
of
the
land
which
they
obtained
as
they
approached
it
in
the
thick
weather
which
prevailed
only
left
them
in
horrible
uncertainty
as
to
their
whereabouts
owing
to
want
of
food
it
was
impossible
to
wait
for
the
weather
to
clear
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
continue
their
eastward
march
threading
their
way
amidst
the
ice
disturbances
which
mark
the
head
of
the
glaciers
the
party
pushed
blindly
forward
in
air
which
was
becoming
thick
with
suddenly
lashly
slipped
in
a
moment
the
whole
party
was
flying
downwards
with
increasing
speed
they
ceased
to
slide
smoothly
they
were
hurled
into
the
air
and
descended
with
great
force
on
to
a
gradual
snow
incline
rising
they
looked
round
them
to
find
above
them
an
feet
high
down
which
they
had
fallen
above
it
the
snow
was
still
drifting
but
where
they
stood
there
was
peace
and
blue
sky
they
recognized
now
for
the
first
time
their
own
glacier
and
the
landmark
and
far
away
in
the
distance
was
the
smoking
summit
of
mount
erebus
it
was
a
miracle
excellent
subsidiary
journeys
were
also
made
of
which
space
allows
no
mention
here
nor
do
they
bear
directly
upon
this
last
expedition
but
in
view
of
the
winter
journey
undertaken
by
us
if
not
for
the
interest
of
the
subject
itself
some
account
must
be
given
of
those
most
aristocratic
inhabitants
of
the
antarctic
the
emperor
penguins
with
whom
wilson
and
his
companions
in
the
discovery
now
became
familiar
there
are
two
kinds
of
antarctic
penguins
the
little
adélie
with
his
coat
and
his
white
weighing
an
object
of
endless
pleasure
and
amusement
and
the
great
dignified
emperor
with
long
curved
beak
bright
orange
and
powerful
flippers
a
personality
of
stones
science
singles
out
the
emperor
as
being
the
more
interesting
bird
because
he
is
more
primitive
possibly
the
most
primitive
of
all
birds
previous
to
the
discovery
expedition
nothing
was
known
of
him
save
that
he
existed
in
the
pack
and
on
the
fringes
of
the
continent
we
have
heard
of
cape
crozier
as
being
the
eastern
extremity
of
ross
island
discovered
by
ross
and
named
after
the
captain
of
the
terror
it
is
here
that
with
immense
pressures
and
rendings
the
moving
sheet
of
the
barrier
piles
itself
up
against
the
mountain
it
is
here
also
that
the
great
which
runs
for
hundreds
of
miles
to
the
east
with
the
barrier
behind
it
and
the
ross
sea
beating
into
its
crevasses
and
caves
joins
the
basalt
precipice
which
bounds
the
knoll
as
the
saddle
which
forms
cape
crozier
is
called
altogether
it
is
the
kind
of
place
where
giants
have
had
a
good
time
in
their
childhood
playing
with
ice
instead
of
mud
so
much
cleaner
too
but
the
slopes
of
mount
terror
do
not
all
end
in
precipices
farther
to
the
west
they
slope
quietly
into
the
sea
and
the
adélie
penguins
have
taken
advantage
of
this
to
found
here
one
of
their
largest
and
most
smelly
rookeries
when
the
discovery
arrived
off
this
rookery
she
sent
a
boat
ashore
and
set
up
a
post
with
a
record
upon
it
to
guide
the
relief
ship
in
the
following
year
the
post
still
stands
later
it
became
desirable
to
bring
the
record
left
here
more
up
to
date
and
so
one
of
the
first
sledging
parties
went
to
try
and
find
a
way
by
the
barrier
to
this
spot
they
were
prevented
from
reaching
the
record
by
a
series
of
most
violent
blizzards
and
indeed
cape
crozier
is
one
of
the
windiest
places
on
earth
but
they
proved
beyond
doubt
that
a
to
the
adélie
penguins
rookery
existed
by
way
of
the
slopes
of
mount
terror
behind
the
knoll
early
the
next
year
another
party
reached
the
record
all
right
and
while
exploring
the
neighbourhood
looked
down
over
the
precipice
which
forms
the
snout
of
cape
crozier
the
sea
was
frozen
over
and
in
a
small
bay
of
ice
formed
by
the
cliffs
of
the
barrier
below
were
numerous
little
dots
which
resolved
themselves
into
emperor
penguins
could
this
be
the
of
these
wonderful
birds
if
so
they
must
nurse
their
eggs
in
in
unimagined
cold
and
darkness
five
days
more
elapsed
before
further
investigation
could
be
made
for
a
violent
blizzard
kept
the
party
in
their
tents
on
october
they
set
out
to
climb
the
high
pressure
ridges
which
lie
between
the
level
barrier
and
the
sea
they
found
that
their
conjectures
were
right
there
was
the
colony
of
emperors
several
were
nursing
chicks
but
all
the
ice
in
the
ross
sea
was
gone
only
the
small
bay
of
ice
remained
the
number
of
adult
birds
was
estimated
at
four
hundred
the
number
of
living
chicks
was
thirty
and
there
were
some
eighty
dead
ones
no
eggs
were
found
several
more
journeys
were
made
to
this
spot
while
the
discovery
was
in
the
south
generally
in
the
spring
and
the
sum
total
of
the
information
gained
came
to
something
like
this
the
emperor
is
a
bird
which
can
not
fly
lives
on
fish
which
it
catches
in
the
sea
and
never
steps
on
land
even
to
breed
for
a
reason
which
was
not
then
understood
it
lays
its
eggs
upon
the
bare
ice
some
time
during
the
winter
and
carries
out
the
whole
process
of
incubation
on
the
sea
ice
resting
the
egg
upon
its
feet
pressed
closely
to
a
patch
of
bare
skin
in
the
lower
abdomen
and
protected
from
the
intense
cold
by
a
loose
falling
lappet
of
skin
and
feathers
by
september
the
earliest
date
upon
which
a
party
arrived
all
the
eggs
which
were
not
broken
or
addled
were
hatched
and
there
were
then
about
a
thousand
adult
emperors
in
the
rookery
arriving
again
on
october
a
party
experienced
a
ten
days
blizzard
which
confined
them
during
seven
days
to
their
tents
but
during
their
windy
visit
they
saw
one
of
the
most
interesting
scenes
in
natural
history
the
story
must
be
told
by
wilson
who
was
there
the
day
before
the
storm
broke
we
were
on
an
old
outlying
cone
of
mount
terror
about
feet
above
the
sea
below
us
lay
the
emperor
penguin
rookery
on
the
bay
ice
and
ross
sea
completely
frozen
over
was
a
plain
of
firm
white
ice
to
the
horizon
there
was
not
even
the
lane
of
open
water
which
usually
runs
along
the
barrier
cliff
stretching
away
as
it
does
like
a
winding
thread
to
the
east
and
out
of
sight
no
space
or
crack
could
be
seen
with
open
water
nevertheless
the
emperors
were
unsettled
owing
there
can
be
no
doubt
to
the
knowledge
that
bad
weather
was
impending
the
mere
fact
that
the
usual
canal
of
open
water
was
not
to
be
seen
along
the
face
of
the
barrier
meant
that
the
ice
in
ross
sea
had
a
southerly
drift
this
in
itself
was
unusual
and
was
caused
by
a
northerly
wind
with
snow
the
precursor
here
of
a
storm
from
the
the
sky
looked
black
and
threatening
the
barometer
began
to
fall
and
before
long
down
came
snowflakes
on
the
upper
heights
of
mount
terror
all
these
warnings
were
an
open
book
to
the
emperor
penguins
and
if
one
knew
the
truth
there
probably
were
many
others
too
they
were
in
consequence
unsettled
and
although
the
ice
had
not
yet
started
moving
the
emperor
penguins
had
a
long
file
was
moving
out
from
the
bay
to
the
open
ice
where
a
pack
of
some
one
or
two
hundred
had
already
collected
about
two
miles
out
at
the
edge
of
a
refrozen
crack
for
an
hour
or
more
that
afternoon
we
watched
this
exodus
proceeding
and
returned
to
camp
more
than
ever
convinced
that
bad
weather
might
be
expected
nor
were
we
disappointed
for
on
the
next
day
we
woke
to
a
southerly
gale
and
smother
of
snow
and
drift
which
effectually
prevented
any
one
of
us
from
leaving
our
camp
at
all
this
continued
without
intermission
all
day
and
night
till
the
following
morning
when
the
weather
cleared
sufficiently
to
allow
us
to
reach
the
edge
of
the
cliff
which
overlooked
the
rookery
illustration
the
emperors
rookery
the
change
here
was
immense
ross
sea
was
open
water
for
nearly
thirty
miles
a
long
line
of
white
pack
ice
was
just
visible
on
the
horizon
from
where
we
stood
some
to
feet
above
the
sea
large
sheets
of
ice
were
still
going
out
and
drifting
to
the
north
and
the
migration
of
the
emperors
was
in
full
swing
there
were
again
two
companies
waiting
on
the
ice
at
the
actual
water
edge
with
some
hundred
more
tailing
out
in
single
file
to
join
them
the
birds
were
waiting
far
out
at
the
edge
of
the
open
water
as
far
as
it
was
possible
for
them
to
walk
on
a
projecting
piece
of
ice
the
very
next
piece
that
would
break
away
and
drift
to
the
north
the
line
of
tracks
in
the
snow
along
which
the
birds
had
gone
the
day
before
was
now
cut
off
short
at
the
edge
of
the
open
water
showing
that
they
had
gone
and
under
the
there
was
an
appreciable
diminution
in
the
number
of
emperors
left
hardly
more
than
half
remaining
of
all
that
we
had
seen
there
six
days
before
two
days
later
the
emigration
was
still
in
full
swing
but
only
the
unemployed
seemed
to
have
gone
as
yet
those
who
were
nursing
chicks
were
still
huddled
under
the
sheltered
as
much
as
possible
from
the
storm
three
days
later
october
no
ice
was
to
be
seen
in
the
ross
sea
the
little
bay
of
ice
was
gradually
being
eaten
away
the
same
exodus
was
in
progress
and
only
a
remnant
of
penguins
was
still
left
of
the
conditions
under
which
the
emperor
lays
her
eggs
the
darkness
and
cold
and
blighting
winds
of
the
excessive
mothering
instinct
implanted
in
the
heart
of
every
bird
male
and
female
of
the
mortality
and
gallant
struggles
against
almost
inconceivable
odds
and
the
final
survival
of
some
per
cent
of
the
eggs
i
hope
to
tell
in
the
account
of
our
winter
journey
the
object
of
which
was
to
throw
light
upon
the
development
of
the
embryo
of
this
remarkable
bird
and
through
it
upon
the
history
of
their
ancestors
as
wilson
wrote
the
possibility
that
we
have
in
the
emperor
penguin
the
nearest
approach
to
a
primitive
form
not
only
of
a
penguin
but
of
a
bird
makes
the
future
working
out
of
its
embryology
a
matter
of
the
greatest
possible
importance
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
us
that
although
we
discovered
their
and
although
we
were
able
to
bring
home
a
number
of
deserted
eggs
and
chicks
we
were
not
able
to
procure
a
series
of
early
embryos
by
which
alone
the
points
of
particular
interest
can
be
worked
out
to
have
done
this
in
a
proper
manner
from
the
spot
at
which
the
discovery
wintered
in
mcmurdo
sound
would
have
involved
us
in
endless
difficulties
for
it
would
have
entailed
the
risks
of
sledge
travelling
in
with
an
almost
total
absence
of
light
it
would
at
any
time
require
that
a
party
of
three
at
least
with
full
camp
equipment
should
traverse
about
a
hundred
miles
of
the
barrier
surface
in
the
dark
and
should
by
moonlight
cross
over
with
rope
and
axe
the
immense
pressure
ridges
which
form
a
chaos
of
crevasses
at
cape
crozier
these
ridges
moreover
which
have
taken
a
party
as
much
as
two
hours
of
careful
work
to
cross
by
daylight
must
be
crossed
and
at
every
visit
to
the
breeding
site
in
the
bay
there
is
no
possibility
even
by
daylight
of
conveying
over
them
the
sledge
or
camping
kit
and
in
the
darkness
of
the
impracticability
is
still
more
obvious
cape
crozier
is
a
focus
for
wind
and
storm
where
every
breath
is
converted
by
the
configuration
of
mounts
erebus
and
terror
into
a
regular
drifting
blizzard
full
of
snow
it
is
here
as
i
have
already
stated
that
on
one
journey
or
another
we
have
had
to
lie
patiently
in
sodden
for
as
many
as
five
and
seven
days
on
end
waiting
for
the
weather
to
change
and
make
it
possible
for
us
to
leave
our
tents
at
all
if
however
these
dangers
were
overcome
there
would
still
be
the
difficulty
of
making
the
needful
preparations
from
the
eggs
the
party
would
have
to
be
on
the
scene
at
any
rate
early
in
july
supposing
that
no
eggs
were
found
upon
arrival
it
would
be
well
to
spend
the
time
in
labelling
the
most
likely
birds
those
for
example
that
have
taken
up
their
stations
close
underneath
the
and
if
this
were
done
it
would
be
easier
then
to
examine
them
daily
by
moonlight
if
it
and
the
weather
generally
were
suitable
conditions
i
must
confess
not
always
easily
obtained
at
cape
crozier
but
if
by
good
luck
things
happened
to
go
well
it
would
by
this
time
be
useful
to
have
a
shelter
built
of
snow
blocks
on
the
in
which
to
work
with
the
cooking
lamp
to
prevent
the
freezing
of
the
egg
before
the
embryo
was
cut
out
and
in
order
that
fluid
solutions
might
be
handy
for
the
various
stages
of
its
preparation
for
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
temperature
all
the
while
may
be
anything
between
zero
and
the
whole
work
no
doubt
would
be
full
of
difficulty
but
it
would
not
be
quite
impossible
and
it
is
with
a
view
to
helping
those
to
whom
the
opportunity
may
occur
in
future
that
this
outline
has
been
added
of
the
difficulties
that
would
surely
beset
their
path
we
shall
meet
the
emperor
penguins
again
but
now
we
must
go
back
to
the
discovery
lying
off
hut
point
with
the
season
advancing
and
twenty
miles
of
ice
between
her
and
the
open
sea
the
prospects
of
getting
out
this
year
seeming
almost
less
promising
than
those
of
the
last
year
an
abortive
attempt
was
made
to
saw
a
channel
from
a
point
still
life
to
scott
and
wilson
in
a
tent
at
cape
royds
was
very
pleasant
after
sledging
and
the
view
of
the
blue
sea
framed
in
the
tent
door
was
very
beautiful
on
a
morning
in
january
when
two
ships
sailed
into
the
frame
why
two
one
was
of
course
the
morning
the
second
proved
to
be
the
terra
nova
it
seemed
that
the
authorities
at
home
had
been
alarmed
at
the
reports
brought
back
the
previous
year
by
the
relief
ship
of
the
detention
of
the
discovery
and
certain
outbreaks
of
scurvy
which
had
occurred
both
on
the
ship
and
on
sledge
journeys
to
make
sure
of
relief
two
ships
had
been
sent
that
was
nothing
to
worry
about
but
the
orders
they
brought
were
staggering
to
sailors
who
had
come
to
love
their
ship
with
a
depth
of
sentiment
which
can
not
be
surprising
when
it
is
remembered
what
we
had
been
through
in
her
and
what
a
comfortable
home
she
had
proved
scott
was
ordered
to
abandon
the
discovery
if
she
could
not
be
freed
in
time
to
accompany
the
relief
ships
to
the
north
for
weeks
there
was
little
or
no
daily
change
they
started
to
transport
the
specimens
and
make
the
other
necessary
preparations
they
almost
despaired
of
freedom
explosions
in
the
ice
were
started
in
the
beginning
of
february
with
little
effect
but
suddenly
there
came
a
change
and
on
the
amidst
intense
excitement
the
ice
was
breaking
up
fast
the
next
day
the
relief
ships
were
but
four
miles
away
on
the
a
shout
of
the
ships
are
coming
sir
brought
out
all
the
men
racing
to
the
slopes
above
arrival
bay
scott
wrote
the
ice
was
breaking
up
right
across
the
strait
and
with
a
rapidity
which
we
had
not
thought
possible
no
sooner
was
one
great
floe
borne
away
than
a
dark
streak
cut
its
way
into
the
solid
sheet
that
remained
and
carved
out
another
to
feed
the
broad
stream
of
pack
which
was
hurrying
away
to
the
i
have
never
witnessed
a
more
impressive
sight
the
sun
was
low
behind
us
the
surface
of
the
in
front
was
intensely
white
and
in
contrast
the
distant
sea
and
its
leads
looked
almost
black
the
wind
had
fallen
to
a
calm
and
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
stillness
about
us
yet
in
the
midst
of
this
peaceful
silence
was
an
awful
unseen
agency
rending
that
great
as
though
it
had
been
naught
but
the
thinnest
paper
we
knew
well
by
this
time
the
nature
of
our
prison
bars
we
had
not
plodded
again
and
again
over
those
long
dreary
miles
of
snow
without
realizing
the
formidable
strength
of
the
great
barrier
which
held
us
bound
we
knew
that
the
heaviest
would
have
shattered
itself
ineffectually
against
it
and
we
had
seen
a
iceberg
brought
to
rest
at
its
edge
for
weeks
we
had
been
struggling
with
this
mighty
obstacle
but
now
without
a
word
without
an
effort
on
our
part
it
was
all
melting
away
and
we
knew
that
in
an
hour
or
two
not
a
vestige
of
it
would
be
left
and
that
the
open
sea
would
be
lapping
on
the
black
rocks
of
hut
point
almost
more
dramatic
was
the
grounding
of
the
discovery
off
the
shoal
at
hut
point
owing
to
the
rise
of
a
blizzard
immediately
after
her
release
from
the
ice
hour
after
hour
she
lay
pounding
on
the
shore
and
when
it
seemed
most
certain
that
she
had
been
freed
only
to
be
destroyed
and
when
all
hope
was
nearly
gone
the
wind
lulled
and
the
waters
of
the
sound
driven
out
by
the
force
of
the
wind
returned
and
the
discovery
floated
off
with
little
damage
the
whole
story
of
the
release
from
the
ice
and
subsequent
grounding
of
the
discovery
is
wonderfully
told
by
scott
in
his
book
some
years
after
this
i
met
wilson
in
a
shooting
lodge
in
scotland
he
was
working
upon
grouse
disease
for
the
royal
commission
which
had
been
appointed
and
i
saw
then
for
the
first
time
something
of
his
magnetic
personality
and
glimpses
also
of
his
methods
of
work
he
and
scott
both
meant
to
go
back
and
finish
the
job
and
i
then
settled
that
when
they
went
i
would
go
too
if
wishing
could
do
anything
meanwhile
shackleton
was
either
in
the
south
or
making
his
preparations
to
go
there
he
left
england
in
and
in
the
following
antarctic
summer
two
wonderful
journeys
were
made
the
first
led
by
shackleton
himself
consisted
of
four
men
and
four
ponies
leaving
cape
royds
where
the
expedition
wintered
in
a
hut
in
november
they
marched
due
south
on
the
barrier
outside
scott
track
until
they
were
stopped
by
the
eastward
trend
of
the
range
of
mountains
and
by
the
chaotic
pressure
caused
by
the
discharge
of
a
brobdingnagian
glacier
but
away
from
the
main
stream
of
the
glacier
and
separated
from
it
by
land
now
known
as
hope
island
was
a
narrow
and
steep
snow
slope
forming
a
gateway
which
opened
on
to
the
main
glacier
stream
boldly
plunging
through
this
the
party
made
its
way
up
the
beardmore
glacier
a
giant
of
its
kind
being
more
than
twice
as
large
as
any
other
known
the
history
of
their
adventures
will
make
anybody
flesh
creep
from
the
top
they
travelled
due
south
toward
the
pole
under
the
trying
conditions
of
the
plateau
and
reached
the
high
latitude
of
before
they
were
forced
to
turn
by
lack
of
food
while
shackleton
was
essaying
the
geographical
pole
another
party
of
three
men
under
professor
david
reached
the
magnetic
pole
travelling
a
distance
of
miles
of
which
miles
were
relay
work
relying
entirely
on
and
with
no
additional
help
this
was
a
very
wonderful
journey
and
when
shackleton
returned
in
he
and
his
expedition
had
made
good
during
the
same
year
the
north
pole
was
reached
by
peary
after
some
twelve
years
of
travelling
in
arctic
regions
scott
published
the
plans
of
his
second
expedition
in
this
expedition
is
the
subject
of
the
present
history
the
terra
nova
sailed
from
the
west
india
dock
london
on
june
and
from
cardiff
on
june
she
made
her
way
to
new
zealand
refitted
and
restowed
her
cargo
took
on
board
ponies
dogs
motor
sledges
certain
further
provisions
and
equipment
as
well
as
such
members
of
her
executive
officers
and
scientists
as
had
not
travelled
out
in
her
and
left
finally
for
the
south
on
november
she
arrived
in
mcmurdo
sound
on
january
and
our
hut
had
been
built
on
cape
evans
and
all
stores
landed
in
less
than
a
fortnight
shortly
afterwards
the
ship
sailed
the
party
which
was
left
at
cape
evans
under
scott
is
known
as
the
main
party
but
the
scientific
objects
of
the
expedition
included
the
landing
of
a
second
but
much
smaller
party
under
campbell
on
king
edward
vii
land
while
returning
from
an
abortive
attempt
to
land
here
they
found
a
norwegian
expedition
under
captain
roald
amundsen
in
nansen
old
ship
the
fram
in
the
bay
of
whales
reference
to
this
expedition
will
be
found
elsewhere
one
member
of
amundsen
party
was
johansen
the
only
companion
of
nansen
on
his
famous
arctic
sledge
journey
of
which
a
brief
outline
has
been
given
above
campbell
and
his
five
companions
were
finally
landed
at
cape
adare
and
built
their
hut
close
to
borchgrevinck
old
winter
quarters
the
ship
returned
to
new
zealand
under
pennell
came
back
to
the
antarctic
a
year
later
with
further
equipment
and
provisions
and
again
two
years
later
to
bring
back
to
civilization
the
survivors
of
the
expedition
the
adventures
and
journeyings
of
the
various
members
of
the
main
party
are
so
numerous
and
simultaneous
that
i
believe
it
will
help
the
reader
who
approaches
this
book
without
previous
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
expedition
to
give
here
a
brief
summary
of
the
course
of
events
those
who
are
familiar
already
with
these
facts
can
easily
skip
a
page
or
two
two
parties
were
sent
out
during
the
first
autumn
the
one
under
scott
to
lay
a
large
depôt
on
the
barrier
for
the
polar
journey
and
this
is
called
the
depôt
journey
the
other
to
carry
out
geological
work
among
the
western
mountains
so
called
because
they
form
the
western
side
of
mcmurdo
sound
this
is
called
the
first
geological
journey
and
another
similar
journey
during
the
following
summer
is
called
the
second
geological
journey
both
parties
joined
up
at
the
old
discovery
hut
at
hut
point
in
march
and
here
waited
for
the
sea
to
freeze
a
passage
northwards
to
cape
evans
meanwhile
the
men
left
at
cape
evans
were
continuing
the
complex
scientific
work
of
the
station
all
the
members
of
the
main
party
were
not
gathered
together
at
cape
evans
for
the
winter
until
may
during
the
latter
half
of
the
winter
a
journey
was
made
by
three
men
led
by
wilson
to
cape
crozier
to
investigate
the
embryology
of
the
emperor
penguin
this
is
called
the
winter
journey
the
journey
to
the
south
pole
absorbed
the
energies
of
most
of
the
sledging
members
during
the
following
summer
of
the
motor
party
turned
back
on
the
barrier
the
dog
party
at
the
bottom
of
the
beardmore
glacier
from
this
point
twelve
men
went
forward
four
of
these
men
under
atkinson
returned
from
the
top
of
the
glacier
in
latitude
they
are
known
as
the
first
return
party
a
fortnight
later
in
latitude
three
more
men
returned
under
lieutenant
evans
these
are
the
second
return
party
five
men
went
forward
scott
wilson
bowers
oates
and
seaman
evans
they
reached
the
pole
on
january
to
find
that
amundsen
had
reached
it
days
earlier
they
returned
statute
miles
and
perished
miles
from
their
winter
quarters
the
supporting
parties
got
back
safely
but
lieutenant
evans
was
very
seriously
ill
with
scurvy
the
food
necessary
for
the
return
of
the
polar
party
from
one
ton
camp
had
not
been
taken
out
at
the
end
of
february
evans
illness
caused
a
hurried
reorganization
of
plans
and
i
was
ordered
to
take
out
this
food
with
one
lad
and
two
this
was
done
and
the
journey
may
be
called
the
dog
journey
to
one
ton
camp
we
must
now
go
back
to
the
six
men
led
by
campbell
who
were
landed
at
cape
adare
in
the
beginning
of
they
were
much
disappointed
by
the
small
amount
of
sledge
work
which
they
were
able
to
do
in
the
summer
of
for
the
in
front
of
them
was
blown
out
early
in
the
year
and
they
were
unable
to
find
a
way
up
through
the
mountains
behind
them
on
to
the
plateau
therefore
when
the
terra
nova
appeared
on
january
it
was
decided
that
she
should
land
them
with
six
sledging
rations
and
some
extra
biscuits
pemmican
and
general
food
near
mount
melbourne
at
evans
coves
some
geographical
miles
south
of
cape
adare
and
some
geographical
miles
from
our
winter
quarters
at
cape
evans
late
on
the
night
of
january
they
were
camped
in
this
spot
and
saw
the
last
of
the
ship
steaming
out
of
the
bay
they
had
arranged
to
be
picked
up
again
on
february
let
us
return
to
mcmurdo
sound
my
two
arrived
at
hut
point
from
one
ton
depôt
on
march
exhausted
the
was
still
in
from
the
barrier
to
hut
point
but
from
there
onwards
was
open
water
and
therefore
no
communication
was
possible
with
cape
evans
atkinson
with
one
seaman
was
at
hut
point
and
the
situation
which
he
outlined
to
me
on
arrival
was
something
as
follows
the
ship
had
left
and
there
was
now
no
possibility
of
her
returning
owing
to
the
lateness
of
the
season
and
she
carried
in
her
lieut
evans
sick
with
scurvy
and
five
other
officers
and
three
men
who
were
returning
home
this
year
this
left
only
four
officers
and
four
men
at
cape
evans
in
addition
to
the
four
of
us
at
hut
point
the
serious
part
of
the
news
was
that
owing
to
a
heavy
pack
the
ship
had
been
absolutely
unable
to
reach
campbell
party
at
evans
coves
attempt
after
attempt
had
made
without
success
would
campbell
winter
where
he
was
would
he
try
to
sledge
down
the
coast
in
the
absence
of
scott
the
command
of
the
expedition
under
the
extraordinarily
difficult
circumstances
which
arose
both
now
and
during
the
coming
year
would
naturally
have
devolved
upon
lieutenant
evans
but
evans
very
sick
was
on
his
way
to
england
the
task
fell
to
atkinson
and
i
hope
that
these
pages
will
show
how
difficult
it
was
and
how
well
he
tackled
it
there
were
now
that
is
since
the
arrival
of
the
four
of
us
at
hut
point
and
no
help
could
be
got
from
cape
evans
owing
to
the
open
water
which
intervened
two
of
us
were
useless
for
further
sledging
and
the
dogs
were
absolutely
done
as
time
went
on
anxiety
concerning
the
of
the
polar
party
was
added
to
the
alarm
we
already
felt
about
campbell
and
his
men
winter
was
fast
closing
down
and
the
weather
was
bad
so
little
could
be
done
by
two
men
what
was
to
be
done
when
was
it
to
be
done
with
the
greatest
possible
chance
of
success
added
to
all
his
greater
anxieties
atkinson
had
me
on
his
hands
and
i
was
pretty
ill
in
the
end
he
made
two
attempts
the
first
with
one
seaman
keohane
to
sledge
out
on
to
the
barrier
leaving
on
march
they
found
the
conditions
very
bad
but
reached
a
point
a
few
miles
south
of
corner
camp
and
returned
soon
after
we
knew
the
southern
party
must
be
dead
nothing
more
could
be
done
until
communication
was
effected
with
winter
quarters
at
cape
evans
this
was
done
by
a
sledge
journey
over
the
newly
frozen
ice
in
the
bays
on
april
help
arrived
at
hut
point
on
april
the
second
attempt
was
then
made
and
this
consisted
of
a
party
of
four
men
who
tried
to
sledge
up
the
western
coast
in
order
to
meet
and
help
campbell
if
he
was
trying
to
sledge
to
us
this
plucky
attempt
failed
as
indeed
it
was
practically
certain
it
would
the
story
of
the
winter
that
followed
will
be
told
and
of
the
decision
which
had
to
be
taken
to
abandon
either
the
search
for
the
polar
party
who
must
be
dead
and
their
records
or
campbell
and
his
men
who
might
be
alive
there
were
not
enough
men
left
to
do
both
we
believed
that
the
polar
party
had
come
to
grief
through
scurvy
or
through
falling
into
a
crevasse
the
true
solution
never
occurred
to
us
for
we
felt
sure
that
except
for
accident
or
disease
they
could
find
their
way
home
without
difficulty
we
decided
to
leave
campbell
to
find
his
way
unaided
down
the
coast
and
to
try
and
find
the
polar
party
records
to
our
amazement
we
found
their
tent
some
geographical
miles
from
hut
point
only
geographical
miles
from
one
ton
camp
they
had
arrived
there
on
march
inside
the
tent
were
the
bodies
of
scott
wilson
and
bowers
oates
had
willingly
walked
out
to
his
death
some
eighteen
miles
before
in
a
blizzard
seaman
evans
lay
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
beardmore
glacier
having
found
the
bodies
and
the
records
the
search
party
returned
proposing
to
make
their
way
up
the
western
coast
in
search
of
campbell
on
arrival
at
hut
point
with
the
i
must
have
gone
to
open
the
hut
door
and
found
pinned
on
to
it
a
note
in
campbell
handwriting
but
my
recollection
of
this
apparently
memorable
incident
is
extraordinarily
vague
it
was
many
long
months
since
we
had
had
good
news
this
was
their
story
when
campbell
originally
landed
at
evans
coves
he
brought
with
him
sledging
provisions
for
six
weeks
in
addition
to
two
weeks
provisions
for
six
men
lbs
sugar
lbs
cocoa
lbs
chocolate
and
lbs
of
biscuit
some
oxo
and
spare
clothing
in
short
after
the
sledge
work
which
they
proposed
and
actually
carried
out
the
men
were
left
with
skeleton
rations
for
four
weeks
they
had
also
a
spare
tent
and
an
extra
it
was
not
seriously
anticipated
that
the
ship
would
have
great
difficulty
in
picking
them
up
in
the
latter
half
of
february
campbell
party
had
carried
out
successful
sledging
and
useful
geological
work
in
the
region
of
evans
coves
they
had
then
camped
on
the
beach
and
looked
for
the
ship
to
relieve
them
there
was
open
water
lashed
to
fury
by
the
wind
so
far
as
they
could
see
and
yet
she
did
not
come
they
concluded
that
she
must
have
been
wrecked
the
actual
fact
was
that
thick
pack
ice
lay
beyond
their
vision
through
which
pennell
was
trying
to
drive
his
ship
time
after
time
until
he
had
either
to
go
or
to
be
frozen
in
he
never
succeeded
in
approaching
nearer
than
miles
it
was
now
that
a
blizzard
wind
started
to
blow
down
from
the
plateau
behind
them
out
into
the
continually
open
sea
in
front
the
situation
was
bad
enough
already
but
of
course
such
weather
conditions
made
it
infinitely
worse
evans
coves
is
paved
with
boulders
over
which
all
journeys
had
to
be
fought
leaning
against
the
wind
as
it
blew
when
a
lull
came
the
luckless
traveller
fell
forward
on
to
his
face
under
these
circumstances
it
was
decided
that
preparations
must
be
made
to
winter
where
they
were
and
to
sledge
down
the
coast
to
cape
evans
in
the
following
spring
the
alternative
of
sledging
down
the
coast
in
march
and
april
never
seems
to
have
been
seriously
considered
at
hut
point
of
course
we
were
entirely
in
the
dark
as
to
what
the
party
would
do
hence
atkinson
journey
over
to
the
western
side
in
april
meanwhile
the
stranded
men
divided
into
two
parties
of
three
men
each
the
first
under
campbell
sank
a
shaft
six
feet
down
into
a
large
and
thence
with
pick
and
shovel
excavated
a
passage
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
cave
twelve
feet
by
nine
feet
and
five
feet
six
inches
high
the
second
under
levick
sought
out
and
killed
all
the
seal
and
penguin
they
could
find
but
their
supply
was
pitifully
small
and
the
men
never
had
a
full
meal
until
night
one
man
always
had
to
be
left
to
look
after
the
tents
which
were
already
so
worn
and
damaged
that
it
was
unsafe
to
leave
them
in
the
wind
by
march
the
cave
was
sufficiently
advanced
for
three
men
to
move
in
priestley
must
tell
how
this
was
done
but
it
should
not
be
supposed
that
the
weather
conditions
were
in
any
way
abnormal
on
what
they
afterwards
called
inexpressible
island
march
strong
breeze
all
day
freshening
to
a
full
gale
at
night
we
have
had
an
awful
day
but
have
managed
to
shift
enough
gear
into
the
cave
to
live
there
temporarily
our
tempers
have
never
been
so
tried
during
the
whole
of
our
life
together
but
they
have
stood
the
strain
pretty
successfully
may
i
never
have
such
another
three
trips
as
were
those
every
time
the
wind
lulled
a
little
i
fell
over
to
windward
and
at
every
gust
i
was
pitched
to
leeward
while
a
dozen
times
or
more
i
was
taken
off
my
feet
and
dashed
against
the
ground
or
against
unfriendly
boulders
the
other
two
had
equally
bad
times
dickason
hurt
his
knee
and
ankle
and
lost
his
sheath
knife
and
campbell
lost
a
compass
and
some
revolver
cartridges
in
the
two
trips
they
made
altogether
it
was
lucky
we
got
across
at
all
it
was
a
fortunate
thing
that
this
wind
often
blew
quite
clear
without
snowfall
or
drift
two
days
later
in
the
same
gale
the
tent
of
the
other
three
men
collapsed
on
top
of
them
at
at
the
sun
was
going
down
and
they
settled
to
make
their
way
across
to
their
comrades
levick
tells
the
story
as
follows
having
done
this
securing
the
remains
of
the
tent
etc
we
started
on
our
journey
this
lay
first
of
all
across
half
a
mile
of
clear
blue
ice
swept
by
the
unbroken
wind
which
met
us
almost
straight
in
the
face
we
could
never
stand
up
so
had
to
scramble
the
whole
distance
on
fours
lying
flat
on
our
bellies
in
the
gusts
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
other
side
we
had
had
enough
our
faces
had
been
rather
badly
bitten
and
i
have
a
very
strong
recollection
of
the
men
countenances
which
were
a
leaden
blue
streaked
with
white
patches
of
once
across
however
we
reached
the
shelter
of
some
large
boulders
on
the
shore
of
the
island
and
waited
here
long
enough
to
thaw
out
our
noses
ears
and
cheeks
a
scramble
of
another
six
hundred
yards
brought
us
to
the
igloo
into
which
we
found
that
the
rest
of
the
party
had
barricaded
themselves
and
after
a
little
shouting
they
came
and
let
us
in
giving
us
a
warm
welcome
and
about
the
most
welcome
hot
meal
that
i
think
any
of
us
had
ever
eaten
illustration
priestley
and
campbell
priestley
continues
after
the
arrival
of
the
evicted
party
we
made
hoosh
and
as
we
warmed
up
from
the
meal
we
cheered
up
and
had
one
of
the
most
successful
we
had
ever
had
forgetting
all
our
troubles
for
an
hour
or
two
it
is
a
pleasing
picture
to
look
back
upon
now
and
if
i
close
my
eyes
i
can
see
again
the
little
cave
cut
out
in
snow
and
ice
with
the
tent
flapping
in
the
doorway
barely
secured
by
and
shovel
arranged
crosswise
against
the
side
of
the
shaft
the
cave
is
lighted
up
with
three
or
four
small
blubber
lamps
which
give
a
soft
yellow
light
at
one
end
lie
campbell
dickason
and
myself
in
our
resting
after
the
day
work
and
opposite
to
us
on
a
raised
dais
formed
by
a
portion
of
the
floor
not
yet
levelled
levick
browning
and
abbott
sit
discussing
their
seal
hoosh
while
the
primus
hums
cheerily
under
the
cooker
containing
the
coloured
water
which
served
with
us
instead
of
cocoa
as
the
diners
warm
up
jests
begin
to
fly
between
the
rival
tents
and
the
interchange
is
brisk
though
we
have
the
upper
hand
having
an
inexhaustible
subject
in
the
recent
disaster
to
their
tent
and
their
forced
abandonment
of
their
household
gods
suddenly
some
one
starts
a
song
with
a
chorus
and
the
noise
from
the
primus
is
dwarfed
immediately
one
by
one
we
go
through
our
favourites
and
the
concert
lasts
for
a
couple
of
hours
by
this
time
the
lamps
are
getting
low
and
gradually
the
cold
begins
to
overcome
the
effects
of
the
hoosh
and
the
cocoa
one
after
another
the
singers
begin
to
shiver
and
all
thoughts
of
song
disappear
as
we
realize
what
we
are
in
for
a
night
with
one
bag
between
two
men
there
is
a
whole
world
of
discomfort
in
the
very
thought
and
no
one
feels
inclined
to
jest
about
that
for
the
moment
those
jests
will
come
all
right
when
the
night
is
safely
past
but
this
evening
it
is
anything
but
a
cheery
subject
of
contemplation
there
is
no
help
for
it
however
and
each
of
us
prepares
to
take
another
man
in
so
far
as
he
can
in
such
spirit
and
under
very
similar
conditions
this
dauntless
party
set
about
passing
through
one
of
the
most
horrible
winters
which
god
has
invented
they
were
very
hungry
for
the
wind
which
kept
the
sea
open
also
made
the
shore
almost
impossible
for
seals
there
were
days
however
such
as
when
browning
found
and
killed
a
seal
and
in
its
stomach
not
too
far
digested
to
be
still
eatable
were
fish
and
what
visions
of
joy
for
the
future
we
never
again
found
a
seal
with
an
eatable
meal
inside
him
but
we
were
always
hoping
to
do
so
and
a
kill
was
therefore
always
a
gamble
whenever
a
seal
was
sighted
in
future
some
one
said
and
there
was
always
a
scramble
to
search
the
beast
first
they
ate
blubber
cooked
with
blubber
had
blubber
lamps
their
clothes
and
gear
were
soaked
with
blubber
and
the
soot
blackened
them
their
cookers
walls
and
roof
choked
their
throats
and
inflamed
their
eyes
blubbery
clothes
are
cold
and
theirs
were
soon
so
torn
as
to
afford
little
protection
against
the
wind
and
so
stiff
with
blubber
that
they
would
stand
up
by
themselves
in
spite
of
frequent
scrapings
with
knives
and
rubbings
with
penguin
skins
and
always
there
were
underfoot
the
great
granite
boulders
which
made
walking
difficult
even
in
daylight
and
calm
weather
as
levick
said
the
road
to
hell
might
be
paved
with
good
intentions
but
it
seemed
probable
that
hell
itself
would
be
paved
something
after
the
style
of
inexpressible
island
but
there
were
consolations
the
lump
of
sugar
the
and
about
these
there
hangs
a
story
when
campbell
party
and
the
remains
of
the
main
party
forgathered
at
cape
evans
in
november
campbell
would
give
out
the
hymns
for
church
the
first
sunday
we
had
the
lord
ye
heavens
adore
him
and
the
second
and
the
third
we
suggested
a
change
to
which
campbell
asked
why
we
said
it
got
a
bit
monotonous
oh
no
said
campbell
we
always
sang
it
on
inexpressible
island
it
was
also
about
the
only
one
he
knew
apart
from
this
i
do
not
know
whether
king
cole
or
the
te
deum
was
more
popular
for
reading
they
had
david
copperfield
the
decameron
the
life
of
stevenson
and
a
new
testament
and
they
did
swedish
drill
and
they
gave
lectures
their
worst
difficulties
were
scurvy
and
ptomaine
poisoning
for
which
the
enforced
diet
was
responsible
from
the
first
they
decided
to
keep
nearly
all
their
unused
rations
for
sledging
down
the
coast
in
the
following
spring
and
this
meant
that
they
must
live
till
then
on
the
seal
and
penguin
which
they
could
kill
the
first
dysentery
was
early
in
the
winter
and
was
caused
by
using
the
salt
from
the
they
had
some
cerebos
salt
however
in
their
sledging
rations
and
used
it
for
a
week
which
stopped
the
disorder
and
they
gradually
got
used
to
the
salt
browning
however
who
had
had
enteric
fever
in
the
past
had
dysentery
almost
continually
right
through
the
winter
had
he
not
been
the
plucky
cheerful
man
he
is
he
would
have
died
in
june
again
there
was
another
bad
attack
of
dysentery
another
thing
which
worried
them
somewhat
was
the
back
a
kink
caused
by
seldom
being
able
to
stand
upright
then
in
the
beginning
of
september
they
had
ptomaine
poisoning
from
meat
which
had
been
too
long
in
what
they
called
the
oven
which
was
a
biscuit
box
hung
over
the
blubber
stove
into
which
they
placed
the
frozen
meat
to
thaw
it
out
this
oven
was
found
to
be
not
quite
level
and
in
a
corner
a
pool
of
old
blood
water
and
scraps
of
meat
had
collected
this
and
a
tainted
hoosh
which
they
did
not
have
the
strength
of
mind
to
throw
away
in
their
hungry
condition
seems
to
have
caused
the
outbreak
which
was
severe
browning
and
dickason
were
especially
bad
they
had
their
bad
days
those
first
days
of
realization
that
they
would
not
be
relieved
days
of
depression
disease
and
hunger
all
at
once
when
the
seal
seemed
as
if
they
would
give
out
and
they
were
thinking
they
would
have
to
travel
down
the
coast
in
the
winter
but
abbott
killed
two
seals
with
a
greasy
knife
losing
the
use
of
three
fingers
in
the
process
and
saved
the
situation
but
they
also
had
their
good
or
days
such
was
night
when
they
held
food
in
their
hands
and
did
not
want
to
eat
it
for
they
were
full
or
when
they
got
through
the
te
deum
without
a
hitch
or
when
they
killed
some
penguins
or
got
a
ration
of
mustard
plaster
from
the
medical
stores
never
was
a
more
cheerful
or
party
they
set
out
to
see
the
humorous
side
of
everything
and
if
they
could
not
do
so
one
day
at
any
rate
they
determined
to
see
to
it
the
next
what
is
more
they
succeeded
and
i
have
never
seen
a
company
of
better
welded
men
than
that
which
joined
us
for
those
last
two
months
in
mcmurdo
sound
on
september
they
started
home
so
they
called
it
this
meant
a
sledge
journey
of
some
two
hundred
miles
along
the
coast
and
its
possibility
depended
upon
the
presence
of
which
we
have
seen
to
have
been
absent
at
evans
coves
it
also
meant
crossing
the
drygalski
ice
tongue
an
obstacle
which
bulked
very
formidably
in
their
imaginations
during
the
winter
they
reached
the
last
rise
of
this
glacier
in
the
evening
of
october
and
then
saw
erebus
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
off
the
igloo
and
the
past
were
behind
cape
evans
and
the
future
were
in
front
and
the
was
in
as
far
as
they
could
see
dickason
was
half
crippled
with
dysentery
when
they
started
but
improved
browning
however
was
still
very
ill
but
now
they
were
able
to
eat
a
ration
of
four
biscuits
a
day
and
a
small
amount
of
pemmican
and
cocoa
which
gave
him
a
better
chance
than
the
continual
meat
as
they
neared
granite
harbour
a
month
after
starting
his
condition
was
so
serious
that
they
discussed
leaving
him
there
with
levick
until
they
could
get
medicine
and
suitable
food
from
cape
evans
but
their
troubles
were
nearly
over
for
on
reaching
cape
roberts
they
suddenly
sighted
the
depôt
left
by
taylor
in
the
previous
year
they
searched
round
like
dogs
scratching
in
the
drifts
and
found
a
whole
case
of
biscuits
and
there
were
butter
and
raisins
and
lard
day
and
night
merged
into
one
long
lingering
feast
and
when
they
started
on
again
their
mouths
were
sore
with
eating
biscuits
more
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
change
of
diet
saved
browning
life
as
they
moved
down
the
coast
they
found
another
depôt
and
yet
another
they
reached
hut
point
on
november
the
story
of
this
our
northern
party
has
been
told
in
full
by
the
two
men
most
able
to
tell
it
by
campbell
in
the
second
volume
of
book
by
priestley
in
a
separate
volume
called
antarctic
adventure
i
have
added
only
these
few
pages
because
save
in
so
far
as
their
adventures
touch
the
main
party
or
the
ship
it
is
better
that
i
should
refer
the
reader
to
these
two
accounts
than
that
i
should
try
and
write
again
at
second
hand
what
has
been
already
twice
told
i
will
only
say
here
that
the
history
of
what
these
men
did
and
suffered
has
been
overshadowed
by
the
more
tragic
tale
of
the
polar
party
they
are
not
men
who
wish
for
public
applause
but
that
is
no
reason
why
the
story
of
a
great
adventure
should
not
be
known
indeed
it
is
all
the
more
reason
why
it
should
be
known
to
those
who
have
not
read
it
i
recommend
priestley
book
mentioned
above
or
campbell
equally
modest
account
in
scott
last
expedition
the
terra
nova
arrived
at
cape
evans
on
january
just
as
we
had
started
to
prepare
for
another
year
and
so
the
remains
of
the
expedition
came
home
that
spring
scott
book
was
published
in
the
autumn
the
story
of
scott
last
expedition
of
is
a
book
of
two
volumes
the
first
volume
of
which
is
scott
personal
diary
of
the
expedition
written
from
day
to
day
before
he
turned
into
his
for
the
night
when
sledging
or
in
the
intervals
of
the
many
details
of
organization
and
preparation
in
the
hut
when
at
winter
quarters
the
readers
of
this
book
will
probably
have
read
that
diary
and
the
accounts
of
the
winter
journey
the
last
year
the
adventures
of
campbell
party
and
the
travels
of
the
terra
nova
which
follow
with
an
object
which
i
will
explain
presently
i
quote
a
review
of
scott
book
from
the
pen
of
one
of
punch
staff
there
is
courage
and
strength
and
loyalty
and
love
shining
out
of
the
second
volume
no
less
than
out
of
the
first
there
were
gallant
gentlemen
who
lived
as
well
as
gallant
gentlemen
who
died
but
it
is
the
story
of
scott
told
by
himself
which
will
give
the
book
a
place
among
the
great
books
of
the
world
that
story
begins
in
november
and
ends
on
march
and
it
is
because
when
you
come
to
the
end
you
will
have
lived
with
scott
for
sixteen
months
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
read
the
last
pages
without
tears
that
message
to
the
public
was
heartrending
enough
when
it
first
came
to
us
but
it
was
as
the
story
of
how
a
great
hero
fell
that
we
read
it
now
it
is
just
the
tale
of
how
a
dear
friend
died
to
have
read
this
book
is
to
have
known
scott
and
if
i
were
asked
to
describe
him
i
think
i
should
use
some
such
words
as
those
which
six
months
before
he
died
he
used
of
the
gallant
gentleman
who
went
with
him
wilson
must
always
fail
when
i
talk
of
him
he
wrote
believe
he
is
the
finest
character
i
ever
met
the
closer
one
gets
to
him
the
more
there
is
to
admire
every
quality
is
so
solid
and
dependable
whatever
the
matter
one
knows
bill
will
be
sound
shrewdly
practical
intensely
loyal
and
quite
unselfish
that
is
true
of
wilson
if
scott
says
so
for
he
knew
men
but
most
of
it
is
also
true
of
scott
himself
i
have
never
met
a
more
beautiful
character
than
that
which
is
revealed
unconsciously
in
these
journals
his
humanity
his
courage
his
faith
his
steadfastness
above
all
his
simplicity
mark
him
as
a
man
among
men
it
is
because
of
his
simplicity
that
his
last
message
the
last
entries
in
his
diary
his
last
letters
are
of
such
undying
beauty
the
letter
of
consolation
and
almost
of
apology
which
on
the
verge
of
death
he
wrote
to
wilson
wife
of
the
man
dying
at
his
side
may
well
be
scott
monument
he
could
have
no
finer
and
he
has
raised
a
monument
for
those
other
gallant
gentlemen
who
died
wilson
oates
bowers
evans
they
are
all
drawn
for
us
clearly
by
him
in
these
pages
they
stand
out
unmistakably
they
too
come
to
be
friends
of
ours
their
death
is
as
noble
and
as
heartbreaking
and
there
were
gallant
gentlemen
i
said
who
lived
you
may
read
amazing
stories
of
them
indeed
it
is
a
wonderful
tale
of
manliness
that
these
two
volumes
tell
us
i
put
them
down
now
but
i
have
been
for
a
few
days
in
the
company
of
the
brave
and
every
hour
with
them
has
made
me
more
proud
for
those
that
died
and
more
humble
for
myself
i
have
quoted
this
review
at
length
because
it
gives
the
atmosphere
of
into
which
we
were
plunged
on
our
return
that
atmosphere
was
very
agreeable
but
it
was
a
refracting
medium
through
which
the
expedition
could
not
be
seen
with
scientific
accuracy
and
the
expedition
was
nothing
if
not
scientific
whilst
we
knew
what
we
had
suffered
and
risked
better
than
any
one
else
we
also
knew
that
science
takes
no
account
of
such
things
that
a
man
is
no
better
for
having
made
the
worst
journey
in
the
world
and
that
whether
he
returns
alive
or
drops
by
the
way
will
be
all
the
same
a
hundred
years
hence
if
his
records
and
specimens
come
safely
to
hand
in
addition
to
scott
last
expedition
and
priestley
antarctic
adventures
griffith
taylor
who
was
physiographer
to
the
main
party
has
written
an
account
of
the
two
geological
journeys
of
which
he
was
the
leader
and
of
the
domestic
life
of
the
expedition
at
hut
point
and
at
cape
evans
up
to
february
in
a
book
called
with
scott
the
silver
lining
this
book
gives
a
true
glimpse
into
the
more
boisterous
side
of
our
life
with
much
useful
information
about
the
scientific
part
though
it
bears
little
upon
this
book
i
can
not
refrain
from
drawing
the
reader
attention
to
and
earning
some
of
his
thanks
for
a
little
book
called
antarctic
penguins
written
by
levick
the
surgeon
of
party
it
is
almost
entirely
about
adélie
penguins
the
author
spent
the
greater
part
of
a
summer
living
as
it
were
upon
sufferance
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
largest
penguin
rookeries
in
the
world
he
has
described
the
story
of
their
crowded
life
with
a
humour
with
which
perhaps
we
hardly
credited
him
and
with
a
simplicity
which
many
writers
of
children
stories
might
envy
if
you
think
your
own
life
hard
and
would
like
to
leave
it
for
a
short
hour
i
recommend
you
to
beg
borrow
or
steal
this
tale
and
read
and
see
how
the
penguins
live
it
is
all
quite
true
so
there
is
already
a
considerable
literature
about
the
expedition
but
no
connected
account
of
it
as
a
whole
scott
diary
had
he
lived
would
merely
have
formed
the
basis
of
the
book
he
would
have
written
as
his
personal
diary
it
has
an
interest
which
no
other
book
could
have
had
but
a
diary
in
this
life
is
one
of
the
only
ways
in
which
a
man
can
blow
off
steam
and
so
it
is
that
scott
book
accentuates
the
depression
which
used
to
come
over
him
sometimes
we
have
seen
the
importance
which
must
attach
to
the
proper
record
of
improvements
weights
and
methods
of
each
and
every
expedition
we
have
seen
how
scott
took
the
system
developed
by
the
arctic
explorers
at
the
point
of
development
to
which
it
had
been
brought
by
nansen
and
applied
it
for
the
first
time
to
antarctic
sledge
travelling
scott
voyage
of
the
discovery
gives
a
vivid
picture
of
mistakes
rectified
and
of
improvements
of
every
kind
shackleton
applied
the
knowledge
they
gained
in
his
first
expedition
scott
in
this
his
second
and
last
on
the
whole
i
believe
this
expedition
was
the
best
equipped
there
has
ever
been
when
the
double
purpose
exploratory
and
scientific
for
which
it
was
organized
is
taken
into
consideration
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
put
all
your
eggs
into
one
basket
to
organize
your
material
and
to
equip
and
choose
your
men
entirely
for
one
object
whether
it
be
the
attainment
of
the
pole
or
the
running
of
a
perfect
series
of
scientific
observations
your
difficulties
increase
directly
you
combine
the
one
with
the
other
as
was
done
in
this
case
neither
scott
nor
the
men
with
him
would
have
gone
for
the
pole
alone
yet
they
considered
the
pole
to
be
an
achievement
worthy
of
a
great
attempt
and
we
took
risks
we
knew
we
took
them
things
have
come
out
against
us
and
therefore
we
have
no
cause
for
complaint
it
is
it
must
be
of
the
first
importance
that
a
system
i
will
not
say
perfected
but
developed
to
a
pitch
of
high
excellence
at
such
a
cost
should
be
handed
down
as
completely
as
possible
to
those
who
are
to
follow
i
want
to
so
tell
this
story
that
the
leader
of
some
future
antarctic
expedition
perhaps
more
than
one
will
be
able
to
take
it
up
and
say
i
have
here
the
material
from
which
i
can
order
the
articles
and
quantities
which
will
be
wanted
for
so
many
men
for
such
and
such
a
time
i
have
also
a
record
of
how
this
material
was
used
by
scott
of
the
plans
of
his
journeys
and
how
his
plans
worked
out
and
of
the
improvements
which
his
parties
were
able
to
make
on
the
spot
or
suggest
for
the
future
i
do
agree
with
such
and
such
but
this
is
a
foundation
and
will
save
me
many
months
of
work
in
preparation
and
give
me
useful
knowledge
for
the
actual
work
of
my
expedition
if
this
book
can
guide
the
future
explorer
by
the
light
of
the
past
it
will
not
have
been
written
in
vain
but
this
was
not
my
main
object
in
writing
this
book
when
i
undertook
in
to
write
for
the
antarctic
committee
an
official
narrative
on
condition
that
i
was
given
a
free
hand
what
i
wanted
to
do
above
all
things
was
to
show
what
work
was
done
who
did
it
to
whom
the
credit
of
the
work
was
due
who
took
the
responsibility
who
did
the
hard
sledging
and
who
pulled
us
through
that
last
and
most
ghastly
year
when
two
parties
were
adrift
and
god
only
knew
what
was
best
to
be
done
when
had
things
gone
on
much
longer
men
would
undoubtedly
have
gone
mad
there
is
no
record
of
these
things
though
perhaps
the
world
thinks
there
is
generally
as
a
mere
follower
without
much
responsibility
and
often
scared
out
of
my
wits
i
was
in
the
thick
of
it
all
and
i
know
unfortunately
i
could
not
reconcile
a
sincere
personal
confession
with
the
decorous
obliquity
of
an
official
narrative
and
i
found
that
i
had
put
the
antarctic
committee
in
a
difficulty
from
which
i
could
rescue
them
only
by
taking
the
book
off
their
hands
for
it
was
clear
that
what
i
had
written
was
not
what
is
expected
from
a
committee
even
though
no
member
may
disapprove
of
a
word
of
it
a
proper
official
narrative
presented
itself
to
our
imaginations
and
sense
of
propriety
as
a
quarto
volume
uniform
with
the
scientific
reports
dustily
invisible
on
museum
shelves
and
replete
with
in
the
words
of
my
commission
times
of
starting
hours
of
march
ground
and
weather
conditions
not
very
useful
as
material
for
future
antarcticists
and
in
no
wise
effecting
any
catharsis
of
the
writer
conscience
i
could
not
pretend
that
i
had
fulfilled
these
conditions
and
so
i
decided
to
take
the
undivided
responsibility
on
my
own
shoulders
none
the
less
the
committee
having
given
me
access
to
its
information
is
entitled
to
all
the
credit
of
a
formal
official
narrative
without
the
least
responsibility
for
the
passages
which
i
have
studied
to
make
as
personal
in
style
as
possible
so
that
no
greater
authority
may
be
attached
to
them
than
i
deserve
i
need
hardly
add
that
the
nine
years
delay
in
the
appearance
of
my
book
was
caused
by
the
war
before
i
had
recovered
from
the
heavy
overdraft
made
on
my
strength
by
the
expedition
i
found
myself
in
flanders
looking
after
a
fleet
of
armoured
cars
a
war
is
like
the
antarctic
in
one
respect
there
is
no
getting
out
of
it
with
honour
as
long
as
you
can
put
one
foot
before
the
other
i
came
back
badly
invalided
and
the
book
had
to
wait
accordingly

atkinson
has
no
doubt
that
the
symptoms
of
the
northern
party
were
those
of
early
scurvy
conditions
of
temperature
in
the
igloo
allowed
of
decomposition
occurring
in
seal
meat
fresh
seal
meat
brought
in
from
outside
reduced
the
scurvy
symptoms
this
tenderness
of
gums
and
tongue
is
additional
evidence
of
scurvy
published
by
fisher
unwin
vol
narrative
of
the
northern
party
a
milne
chapter
i
from
england
to
south
africa
take
a
bowsy
short
leave
of
your
nymphs
on
the
shore
and
silence
their
mourning
with
vows
of
returning
though
never
intending
to
visit
them
more
and
scott
used
to
say
that
the
worst
part
of
an
expedition
was
over
when
the
preparation
was
finished
so
no
doubt
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
he
saw
the
terra
nova
out
from
cardiff
into
the
atlantic
on
june
cardiff
had
given
the
expedition
a
most
generous
and
enthusiastic
and
scott
announced
that
it
should
be
his
first
port
on
returning
to
england
just
three
years
more
and
the
terra
nova
worked
back
from
new
zealand
by
pennell
reached
cardiff
again
on
june
and
paid
off
there
from
the
first
everything
was
informal
and
most
pleasant
and
those
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
help
in
working
the
ship
out
to
new
zealand
under
steam
or
sail
must
in
spite
of
five
months
of
considerable
discomfort
and
very
hard
work
look
back
upon
the
voyage
as
one
of
the
very
happiest
times
of
the
expedition
to
some
of
us
perhaps
the
voyage
out
the
three
weeks
in
the
pack
ice
going
south
and
the
robinson
crusoe
life
at
hut
point
are
the
pleasantest
of
many
happy
memories
scott
made
a
great
point
that
so
far
as
was
possible
the
personnel
of
the
expedition
must
go
out
with
the
terra
nova
possibly
he
gave
instructions
that
they
were
to
be
worked
hard
and
no
doubt
it
was
a
good
opportunity
of
testing
our
mettle
we
had
been
chosen
out
of
volunteers
executive
officers
scientific
staff
crew
and
all
we
differed
entirely
from
the
crew
of
an
ordinary
merchant
ship
both
in
our
personnel
and
in
our
methods
of
working
the
executive
officers
were
drawn
from
the
navy
as
were
also
the
crew
in
addition
there
was
the
scientific
staff
including
one
doctor
who
was
not
a
naval
surgeon
but
who
was
also
a
scientist
and
two
others
called
by
scott
helpers
namely
oates
and
myself
the
scientific
staff
of
the
expedition
numbered
twelve
members
all
told
but
only
six
were
on
board
the
remainder
were
to
join
the
ship
at
lyttelton
new
zealand
when
we
made
our
final
embarcation
for
the
south
of
those
on
the
ship
wilson
was
chief
of
the
scientific
staff
and
united
in
himself
the
various
functions
of
vertebral
zoologist
doctor
artist
and
as
this
book
will
soon
show
the
unfailing
of
all
on
board
lieutenant
evans
was
in
command
with
campbell
as
first
officer
watches
were
of
course
assigned
immediately
to
the
executive
officers
the
crew
was
divided
into
a
port
and
starboard
watch
and
the
ordinary
routine
of
a
sailing
ship
with
auxiliary
steam
was
followed
beyond
this
no
work
was
definitely
assigned
to
any
individual
on
board
how
the
custom
of
the
ship
arose
i
do
not
know
but
in
effect
most
things
were
done
by
volunteer
labour
it
was
recognized
that
every
one
whose
work
allowed
turned
to
immediately
on
any
job
which
was
wanted
but
it
was
an
absolutely
voluntary
duty
volunteers
to
shorten
sail
to
coal
to
shift
cargo
to
pump
to
paint
or
wash
down
paintwork
they
were
constant
calls
some
of
them
almost
hourly
calls
day
and
night
and
there
was
never
any
failure
to
respond
fully
this
applied
not
only
to
the
scientific
staff
but
also
whenever
their
regular
duties
allowed
to
the
executive
officers
there
was
an
officer
on
the
ship
who
did
not
shift
coal
till
he
was
sick
of
the
sight
of
it
but
i
heard
no
complaints
such
a
system
soon
singles
out
the
real
willing
workers
but
it
is
apt
to
put
an
undue
strain
upon
them
meanwhile
most
of
the
executive
officers
as
well
as
the
scientific
staff
had
their
own
work
to
do
which
they
were
left
to
fit
in
as
most
convenient
the
first
days
out
from
england
were
spent
in
such
hard
and
crowded
work
that
we
shook
down
very
quickly
i
then
noticed
for
the
first
time
wilson
great
gift
of
tact
and
how
quick
he
was
to
see
the
small
things
which
make
so
much
difference
at
the
same
time
his
passion
for
work
set
a
high
standard
pennell
was
another
glutton
we
dropped
anchor
in
funchal
harbour
madeira
about
on
june
eight
days
out
the
ship
had
already
been
running
under
sail
and
steam
the
decks
were
as
clear
as
possible
there
was
some
paintwork
to
show
and
with
a
good
harbour
stow
she
looked
thoroughly
workmanlike
and
neat
some
scientific
work
in
particular
tow
netting
and
magnetic
observations
had
already
been
done
but
even
as
early
as
this
we
had
spent
hours
on
the
pumps
and
it
was
evident
that
these
pumps
were
going
to
be
a
constant
nightmare
in
madeira
as
everywhere
we
were
given
freely
of
such
things
as
we
required
we
left
in
the
early
morning
of
june
after
pennell
had
done
some
hours
magnetic
work
with
the
lloyd
creak
and
barrow
dip
circle
on
june
noon
position
lat
long
it
was
possible
to
write
a
fortnight
out
and
from
the
general
appearance
of
the
wardroom
we
might
have
been
out
a
year
we
were
to
a
great
extent
strangers
to
one
another
when
we
left
england
but
officers
and
crew
settled
down
to
their
jobs
quickly
and
when
men
live
as
close
as
we
did
they
settle
down
or
quarrel
before
very
long
let
us
walk
into
the
cabins
which
surround
the
small
wardroom
aft
the
first
on
the
left
is
that
of
scott
and
lieutenant
evans
but
scott
is
not
on
board
and
wilson
has
taken
his
place
in
the
next
cabin
to
them
is
drake
the
secretary
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
screw
are
oates
atkinson
and
levick
the
two
latter
being
doctors
and
on
the
port
side
campbell
and
pennell
who
is
navigator
then
rennick
and
bowers
the
latter
just
home
from
the
persian
gulf
both
of
these
are
watchkeepers
in
the
next
cabin
are
simpson
meteorologist
back
from
simla
with
nelson
and
lillie
marine
biologists
in
the
last
cabin
the
nursery
are
the
youngest
and
necessarily
the
best
behaved
of
this
community
wright
the
physicist
and
chemist
gran
the
norwegian
and
myself
wilson
helper
and
assistant
zoologist
it
is
difficult
to
put
a
man
down
as
performing
any
special
job
where
each
did
so
many
but
that
is
roughly
what
we
were
certain
men
already
began
to
stand
out
wilson
with
an
apparently
inexhaustible
stock
of
knowledge
on
little
things
and
big
always
ready
to
give
help
and
always
ready
with
sympathy
and
insight
a
tremendous
worker
and
as
unselfish
as
possible
a
universal
adviser
pennell
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
working
out
sights
taking
his
watch
on
the
bridge
or
if
not
on
watch
full
of
energy
aloft
trimming
coal
or
any
other
job
that
came
along
withal
spending
hours
a
day
on
magnetic
work
which
he
did
as
a
hobby
and
not
in
any
way
as
his
job
bowers
was
proving
himself
the
best
seaman
on
board
with
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
whereabouts
and
contents
of
every
case
box
and
bale
and
with
a
supreme
contempt
for
heat
or
cold
simpson
was
obviously
a
scientist
devoted
to
his
work
in
which
wright
gave
him
very
great
and
unselfish
help
while
at
the
same
time
doing
much
of
the
ship
work
oates
and
atkinson
generally
worked
together
in
a
solid
dependable
and
somewhat
humorous
way
evans
who
will
always
be
called
lieutenant
evans
in
this
book
to
distinguish
him
from
seaman
evans
was
in
charge
of
the
ship
and
did
much
to
cement
together
the
rough
material
into
a
nucleus
which
was
capable
of
standing
without
any
friction
the
strains
of
nearly
three
years
of
crowded
isolated
and
difficult
life
ably
seconded
by
victor
campbell
first
officer
commonly
called
the
mate
in
whose
hands
the
routine
and
discipline
of
the
ship
was
most
efficiently
maintained
i
was
very
frightened
of
campbell
scott
himself
was
unable
to
travel
all
the
way
out
to
new
zealand
in
the
terra
nova
owing
to
the
business
affairs
of
the
expedition
but
he
joined
the
ship
from
simon
bay
to
melbourne
the
voyage
itself
on
the
sailing
track
from
madeira
to
the
cape
was
at
first
uneventful
we
soon
got
into
hot
weather
and
at
night
every
available
bit
of
deck
space
was
used
on
which
to
sleep
the
more
particular
slung
hammocks
but
generally
men
used
such
deck
space
as
they
could
find
such
as
the
top
of
the
icehouse
where
they
were
free
from
the
running
tackle
and
rolled
themselves
into
their
blankets
so
long
as
we
had
a
wind
we
ran
under
sail
alone
and
on
those
days
men
would
bathe
over
the
side
in
the
morning
but
when
the
engines
were
going
we
could
get
the
hose
in
the
morning
which
was
preferred
especially
after
a
shark
was
seen
making
for
bowers
red
breast
as
he
swam
the
scene
on
deck
in
the
early
morning
was
always
interesting
all
hands
were
roused
before
six
and
turned
on
to
the
pumps
for
the
ship
was
leaking
considerably
normally
the
well
showed
about
ten
inches
of
water
when
the
ship
was
dry
before
pumping
the
sinker
would
show
anything
over
two
feet
the
ship
was
generally
dry
after
an
hour
to
an
hour
and
a
half
pumping
and
by
that
time
we
had
had
quite
enough
of
it
as
soon
as
the
officer
of
the
watch
had
given
the
order
vast
pumping
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
strip
and
the
deck
was
dotted
with
men
trying
to
get
the
maximum
amount
of
water
from
the
sea
in
a
small
bucket
let
down
on
a
line
from
the
moving
ship
first
efforts
in
this
direction
would
have
been
amusing
had
it
not
been
for
the
caustic
eye
of
the
on
the
bridge
if
the
reader
ever
gets
the
chance
to
try
the
experiment
especially
in
a
swell
he
will
soon
find
himself
with
neither
bucket
nor
water
the
poor
mate
was
annoyed
by
the
loss
of
his
buckets
everybody
was
working
very
hard
during
these
days
shifting
coal
reefing
and
furling
sail
aloft
hauling
on
the
ropes
on
deck
together
with
magnetic
and
meteorological
observations
collecting
and
making
skins
and
so
forth
during
the
first
weeks
there
was
more
cargo
stowing
and
paintwork
than
at
other
times
otherwise
the
work
ran
in
very
much
the
same
lines
all
the
way
out
a
period
of
nearly
five
months
on
july
we
were
overhauled
by
the
only
ship
we
ever
saw
so
far
as
i
can
remember
during
all
that
time
the
inverclyde
a
barque
out
from
glasgow
to
buenos
ayres
it
was
an
oily
calm
day
with
a
sea
like
glass
and
she
looked
as
wilson
quoted
like
a
painted
ship
upon
a
painted
ocean
as
she
lay
with
all
sail
set
we
picked
up
the
trade
two
days
later
being
then
north
of
the
cape
verde
islands
lat
long
at
noon
it
was
a
sunday
and
there
was
a
general
and
mend
throughout
the
ship
the
first
since
we
sailed
during
the
day
we
ran
from
deep
clear
blue
water
into
a
darkish
and
thick
green
sea
this
remarkable
change
of
colour
which
was
observed
by
the
discovery
expedition
in
much
the
same
place
was
supposed
to
be
due
to
a
large
mass
of
pelagic
fauna
called
plankton
the
plankton
which
drifts
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
is
distinct
from
the
nekton
which
swims
submerged
the
terra
nova
was
fitted
with
tow
nets
with
very
fine
meshes
for
collecting
these
inhabitants
of
the
open
sea
together
with
the
algae
or
minute
plant
organisms
which
afford
them
an
abundant
food
supply
the
plankton
nets
can
be
lowered
when
the
ship
is
running
at
full
speed
and
a
great
many
such
hauls
were
made
during
the
expedition
july
had
an
unpleasant
surprise
in
store
at
the
ship
bell
rang
and
there
was
a
sudden
cry
of
fire
quarters
two
minimax
fire
extinguishers
finished
the
fire
which
was
in
the
lazarette
and
was
caused
by
a
lighted
lamp
which
was
upset
by
the
roll
of
the
ship
the
result
was
a
good
deal
of
smoke
a
certain
amount
of
water
below
and
some
singed
paper
but
we
realized
that
a
fire
on
such
an
old
wooden
ship
would
be
a
very
serious
matter
and
greater
care
was
taken
after
this
such
a
voyage
shows
nature
in
her
most
attractive
form
and
always
there
was
a
man
close
by
whose
special
knowledge
was
in
the
whales
porpoises
dolphins
fish
birds
parasites
plankton
radium
and
other
things
which
we
watched
through
microscopes
or
nelson
caught
a
portuguese
arethusa
as
it
sailed
past
us
close
under
the
counter
these
animals
are
common
but
few
can
realize
how
beautiful
they
are
until
they
see
them
from
the
deep
sea
floating
and
sailing
in
a
big
glass
bowl
it
vainly
tried
to
sail
out
and
vigorously
tried
to
sting
all
who
touched
it
wilson
painted
it
from
first
to
last
the
study
of
life
of
all
kinds
was
of
absorbing
interest
to
all
on
board
and
when
we
landed
in
the
antarctic
as
well
as
on
the
ship
everybody
worked
and
was
genuinely
interested
in
all
that
lived
and
had
its
being
on
the
fringe
of
that
great
sterile
continent
not
only
did
officers
who
had
no
direct
interest
in
anything
but
their
own
particular
work
or
scientific
subject
spend
a
large
part
of
their
time
in
helping
making
notes
and
keeping
observations
but
the
seamen
also
had
a
large
share
in
the
specimens
and
data
of
all
descriptions
which
have
been
brought
back
several
of
them
became
good
pupils
for
skinning
birds
meanwhile
perhaps
the
constant
cries
of
whale
whale
or
new
bird
or
dolphins
sometimes
found
the
biologist
concerned
less
eager
to
leave
his
meal
than
the
observers
were
to
call
him
forth
good
opportunities
of
studying
the
life
of
sea
birds
whales
dolphins
and
other
forms
of
life
in
the
sea
even
those
comparatively
few
forms
which
are
visible
from
the
surface
are
not
too
common
a
modern
liner
moves
so
quickly
that
it
does
not
attract
life
to
it
in
the
same
way
as
a
ship
like
the
terra
nova
and
when
specimens
are
seen
they
are
gone
almost
as
soon
as
they
are
observed
those
who
wish
to
study
sea
life
and
there
is
much
to
be
done
in
this
field
should
travel
by
tramp
steamers
or
better
still
sailing
vessels
dolphins
were
constantly
playing
under
the
bows
of
the
ship
giving
a
very
good
chance
for
identification
and
whales
were
also
frequently
sighted
and
would
sometimes
follow
the
ship
as
did
also
hundreds
of
sea
birds
petrels
shearwaters
and
albatross
it
says
much
for
the
interest
and
keenness
of
the
officers
on
board
that
a
complete
hourly
log
was
kept
from
beginning
to
end
of
the
numbers
and
species
which
were
seen
generally
with
the
most
complete
notes
as
to
any
peculiarity
or
habit
which
was
noticed
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
full
use
will
be
made
by
those
in
charge
of
the
working
out
of
these
results
of
these
logs
which
were
kept
so
thoroughly
and
sometimes
under
such
difficult
circumstances
and
conditions
of
weather
and
sea
though
many
helped
this
log
was
largely
the
work
of
pennell
who
was
an
untiring
and
exact
observer
we
lost
the
trade
about
july
and
ran
into
the
doldrums
on
the
whole
we
could
not
complain
of
the
weather
we
never
had
a
gale
or
big
sea
until
after
leaving
south
trinidad
and
though
an
old
ship
with
no
modern
ventilation
is
bound
to
be
stuffy
in
the
tropics
we
lived
and
slept
on
deck
so
long
as
it
was
not
raining
if
it
rained
at
night
as
it
frequently
does
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
number
of
forms
could
be
heard
discussing
as
to
whether
it
was
best
to
stick
it
above
or
face
the
heat
below
and
if
the
rain
persisted
sleepy
and
somewhat
snappy
individuals
were
to
be
seen
trying
to
force
themselves
and
a
maximum
amount
of
damp
bedding
down
the
wardroom
gangway
at
the
same
time
a
thick
wooden
ship
will
keep
fairly
cool
in
the
not
severe
heat
through
which
we
passed
one
want
which
was
unavoidable
was
the
lack
of
fresh
water
there
was
none
to
wash
in
though
a
glass
of
water
was
allowed
for
shaving
with
an
unlimited
amount
of
sea
water
this
may
not
seem
much
of
a
hardship
nor
is
it
unless
you
have
very
dirty
work
to
do
but
inasmuch
as
some
of
the
officers
were
coaling
almost
daily
they
found
that
any
amount
of
cold
sea
water
even
with
a
euphemistically
named
soap
had
no
very
great
effect
in
removing
the
coal
dust
the
alternative
was
to
make
friends
with
the
authorities
and
draw
some
water
from
the
boilers
perhaps
therefore
it
was
not
with
purely
disinterested
motives
that
some
of
us
undertook
to
do
the
stoking
during
the
morning
watch
and
also
later
in
the
day
during
our
passage
through
the
tropics
since
the
staff
was
reduced
by
sickness
a
very
short
time
will
convince
anybody
that
the
ease
with
which
men
accustomed
to
this
work
get
through
their
watch
is
mainly
due
to
custom
and
method
the
ship
had
no
forced
draught
nor
modern
ventilating
apparatus
four
hours
in
the
boiling
fiery
furnace
which
the
terra
nova
stokehold
formed
in
the
tropics
unless
there
was
a
good
wind
to
blow
down
the
one
canvas
shaft
was
a
real
test
of
staying
power
and
the
actual
shovelling
of
the
coal
into
the
furnaces
one
after
the
other
was
as
child
play
to
handling
the
as
the
weighty
instrument
used
for
breaking
up
the
clinker
and
shaping
the
fire
was
called
the
boilers
were
cylindrical
marine
or
return
tube
boilers
the
furnaces
being
six
feet
long
by
three
feet
wide
slightly
lower
at
the
back
than
at
the
front
the
fire
on
the
bars
was
kept
that
is
some
nine
inches
high
at
the
back
tapering
to
about
six
inches
in
front
against
the
furnace
doors
the
furnaces
were
corrugated
for
strength
we
were
supposed
to
keep
the
pressure
on
the
gauge
between
and
but
it
wanted
some
doing
for
the
most
part
it
was
done
we
did
however
get
uncomfortable
days
with
the
rain
sluicing
down
and
a
high
temperature
everything
wet
on
deck
and
below
but
it
had
its
advantages
in
the
fresh
water
it
produced
every
bucket
was
on
duty
and
the
ship
company
stripped
naked
and
ran
about
the
decks
or
sat
in
the
stream
between
the
laboratories
and
wardroom
skylight
and
washed
their
very
dirty
clothes
the
stream
came
through
into
our
bunks
and
no
amount
of
caulking
ever
stopped
it
to
sleep
with
a
constant
drip
of
water
falling
upon
you
is
a
real
trial
these
hot
wet
days
were
more
trying
to
the
nerves
than
the
months
of
wet
rough
but
cooler
weather
to
come
and
it
says
much
for
the
good
spirit
which
prevailed
that
there
was
no
friction
though
we
were
crowded
together
like
sardines
in
a
tin
july
was
a
typical
day
lat
long
a
very
hot
rainy
night
followed
by
a
squall
which
struck
us
while
we
were
having
breakfast
so
we
went
up
and
set
all
sail
which
took
until
about
we
then
sat
in
the
water
on
the
deck
and
washed
clothes
until
just
before
when
the
wind
dropped
though
the
rain
continued
so
we
went
up
and
furled
all
sail
a
tedious
business
when
the
sails
are
wet
and
heavy
then
work
on
cargo
or
coal
till
supper
and
glad
to
get
to
sleep
on
july
lat
long
we
crossed
the
line
with
all
pomp
and
ceremony
at
neptune
in
the
person
of
seaman
evans
hailed
and
stopped
the
ship
he
came
on
board
with
his
motley
company
who
solemnly
paced
aft
to
the
break
of
the
poop
where
he
was
met
by
lieutenant
evans
his
wife
browning
a
doctor
paton
barber
cheetham
two
policemen
and
four
bears
of
whom
atkinson
and
oates
were
two
grouped
themselves
round
him
while
the
barrister
abbott
read
an
address
to
the
captain
and
then
the
procession
moved
round
to
the
bath
a
sail
full
of
water
slung
in
the
break
of
the
poop
on
the
starboard
side
nelson
was
the
first
victim
he
was
examined
then
overhauled
by
the
doctor
given
a
pill
and
a
dose
and
handed
over
to
the
barber
who
lathered
him
with
a
black
mixture
consisting
of
soot
flour
and
water
was
shaved
by
cheetham
with
a
great
wooden
razor
and
then
the
policemen
tipped
him
backwards
into
the
bath
where
the
bears
were
waiting
as
he
was
being
pushed
in
he
seized
the
barber
and
took
him
with
him
wright
lillie
simpson
and
levick
followed
with
about
six
of
the
crew
finally
gran
the
norwegian
was
caught
as
an
extra
never
having
been
across
the
line
in
a
british
ship
but
he
threw
the
doctor
over
his
head
into
the
bath
after
which
he
was
lathered
very
gingerly
and
cheetham
having
been
in
once
refused
to
shave
him
at
all
so
they
tipped
him
in
and
wished
they
had
never
caught
him
the
procession
and
neptune
presented
certificates
to
those
who
had
been
initiated
the
proceedings
closed
with
a
in
the
evening
these
were
of
very
frequent
occurrence
the
expedition
was
very
fond
of
singing
though
there
was
hardly
anybody
in
it
who
could
sing
the
usual
custom
at
this
time
was
that
every
one
had
to
contribute
a
song
in
turn
all
round
the
table
after
supper
if
he
could
not
sing
he
had
to
compose
a
limerick
if
he
could
not
compose
a
limerick
he
had
to
contribute
a
fine
towards
the
wine
fund
which
was
to
make
some
purchases
when
we
reached
cape
town
at
other
times
we
played
the
most
childish
games
there
was
one
called
priest
of
the
parish
has
lost
his
cap
over
which
we
laughed
till
we
cried
and
much
money
was
added
to
the
wine
fund
as
always
happens
certain
songs
became
conspicuous
for
a
time
one
of
these
i
am
sure
that
campbell
who
was
always
at
work
and
upon
whom
the
routine
of
the
ship
depended
will
never
forget
i
do
not
know
who
it
was
that
started
singing
everybody
works
but
father
that
poor
old
man
but
campbell
who
was
the
only
father
on
board
and
whose
hair
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
getting
thin
on
the
top
of
his
head
may
remember
we
began
to
make
preparations
for
a
run
ashore
a
real
adventure
on
an
uninhabited
and
unknown
island
the
sailing
track
of
ships
from
england
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
lies
out
towards
the
coast
of
brazil
and
not
far
from
the
mysterious
island
of
south
trinidad
miles
east
of
brazil
in
and
this
island
is
difficult
of
access
owing
to
its
steep
rocky
coast
and
the
big
atlantic
swell
which
seldom
ceases
it
has
therefore
been
little
visited
and
as
it
is
infested
with
land
crabs
the
stay
of
the
few
parties
which
have
been
there
has
been
short
but
scientifically
it
is
of
interest
not
only
for
the
number
of
new
species
which
may
be
obtained
there
but
also
for
the
extraordinary
attitude
of
wild
sea
birds
towards
human
beings
whom
they
have
never
learnt
to
fear
before
we
left
england
it
had
been
decided
to
attempt
a
landing
and
spend
a
day
there
if
we
should
pass
sufficiently
near
to
it
those
who
have
visited
it
in
the
past
include
the
astronomer
halley
who
occupied
it
in
sir
james
ross
outward
bound
for
the
antarctic
in
spent
a
day
there
landing
in
a
small
cove
a
short
distance
to
the
northward
of
the
nine
pin
rock
of
halley
the
surf
on
all
other
parts
being
too
great
to
admit
of
it
without
hazarding
the
destruction
of
our
boats
ross
also
writes
that
horsburgh
mentions
the
island
abounds
with
wild
pig
and
goats
one
of
the
latter
was
seen
with
the
view
to
add
somewhat
to
the
stock
of
useful
creatures
a
cock
and
two
hens
were
put
on
shore
they
seemed
to
enjoy
the
change
and
i
have
no
doubt
in
so
unfrequented
a
situation
and
so
delightful
a
climate
will
quickly
increase
in
numbers
i
am
afraid
we
did
not
find
any
of
their
descendants
nor
those
of
the
pig
and
goats
i
doubt
whether
fowls
would
survive
the
land
crabs
very
long
there
are
many
wild
birds
on
the
island
however
which
may
feed
the
shipwrecked
and
also
a
depôt
left
by
the
government
for
that
purpose
another
visitor
was
knight
who
wrote
a
book
called
the
cruise
of
the
falcon
concerning
his
efforts
to
discover
the
treasure
which
is
said
to
have
been
left
there
scott
also
visited
it
in
the
discovery
in
when
a
new
petrel
was
found
which
was
afterwards
called
wilsoni
after
the
same
bill
who
was
zoologist
of
both
scott
expeditions
and
so
it
came
about
that
on
the
evening
of
july
we
furled
sail
and
lay
five
miles
from
south
trinidad
with
all
our
preparations
made
for
a
very
thorough
search
of
this
island
of
treasure
everything
was
to
be
captured
alive
or
dead
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
at
five
the
next
morning
we
were
steaming
slowly
towards
what
looked
like
a
quite
impregnable
face
of
rock
with
bare
cliffs
standing
straight
out
of
the
water
which
luckily
for
us
was
comparatively
smooth
as
we
coasted
to
try
and
find
a
the
sun
was
rising
behind
the
island
which
reaches
to
a
height
of
two
thousand
feet
and
the
jagged
cliffs
stood
up
finely
against
the
rosy
sky
illustration
south
trinidad
wilson
del
we
dropped
our
anchor
to
the
south
of
the
island
and
a
boat
crew
left
to
prospect
for
a
whilst
wilson
seized
the
opportunity
to
shoot
some
birds
as
specimens
including
two
species
of
frigate
bird
and
the
seamen
caught
some
of
the
multitudinous
fish
we
also
fired
shots
at
the
sharks
which
soon
thronged
round
the
ship
and
about
which
we
were
to
think
more
before
the
day
was
done
the
boat
came
back
with
the
news
that
a
possible
had
been
found
and
the
landing
parties
got
off
about
the
landing
was
very
bad
a
ledge
of
rock
weathered
out
of
the
cliff
to
our
right
formed
as
it
were
a
staging
along
which
it
was
possible
to
pass
on
to
a
steeply
shelving
talus
slope
in
front
of
us
the
sea
being
comparatively
smooth
everybody
was
landed
dry
with
their
guns
and
collecting
gear
the
best
account
of
south
trinidad
is
contained
in
a
letter
written
by
bowers
to
his
mother
which
is
printed
here
but
some
brief
notes
which
i
jotted
down
at
the
time
may
also
be
of
interest
since
they
give
an
account
of
a
different
part
of
the
island
having
made
a
small
depôt
of
cartridges
together
with
a
little
fluffy
tern
and
a
tern
egg
which
wilson
found
on
the
rocks
we
climbed
westward
round
and
up
to
a
point
from
which
we
could
see
into
the
east
bay
this
was
our
first
stand
and
we
shot
several
petrel
oestrelata
trinitatis
and
also
petrel
oestrelata
arminjoniana
later
on
we
got
over
the
brow
of
a
cliff
where
the
petrel
were
nesting
we
took
two
nests
on
each
of
which
a
and
a
petrel
were
paired
wilson
caught
one
in
his
hands
and
i
caught
another
on
its
nest
it
really
did
not
know
whether
it
ought
to
fly
away
or
not
this
gives
rise
to
an
interesting
problem
since
these
two
birds
have
been
classified
as
different
species
and
it
now
looks
as
though
they
are
the
same
the
gannets
and
terns
were
quite
extraordinary
like
all
the
living
things
there
if
you
stay
still
enough
the
terns
perch
on
your
head
in
any
case
they
will
not
fly
off
the
rocks
till
you
are
two
or
three
feet
away
several
gannets
were
caught
in
the
men
hands
all
the
fish
which
the
biologist
collected
can
travel
quite
fast
on
land
when
the
discovery
was
here
wilson
saw
a
fish
come
out
of
the
sea
seize
a
land
crab
about
eighteen
inches
away
and
take
it
back
into
the
water
the
land
crabs
were
all
over
the
place
in
thousands
it
seems
probable
that
their
chief
enemies
are
themselves
they
are
regular
cannibals
then
we
did
a
real
long
climb
northwards
over
rocks
and
tufty
grass
till
from
the
point
we
had
reached
we
could
see
both
sides
of
the
island
and
the
little
martin
vas
islands
in
the
distance
we
found
lots
of
little
tern
and
terns
eggs
lying
out
on
the
bare
rock
with
no
nest
at
all
hooper
also
brought
us
two
little
gannets
all
fluffy
but
even
at
this
age
larger
than
a
rook
as
we
got
further
up
we
began
to
come
across
the
fossilized
trees
for
which
the
island
is
well
known
four
or
five
captain
biscuits
made
an
excellent
lunch
and
afterwards
we
started
to
the
real
top
of
the
island
a
hill
rising
to
the
west
of
us
it
was
covered
with
a
high
scrubby
bush
and
rocks
and
was
quite
thick
in
fact
there
was
more
vegetation
here
than
on
all
the
rest
we
had
seen
and
in
making
our
way
through
it
we
had
to
keep
calling
in
order
to
keep
touch
with
one
another
the
tree
ferns
were
numerous
but
stunted
the
gannets
were
sleeping
on
the
tops
of
the
bushes
and
some
of
the
crabs
had
climbed
up
the
bushes
and
were
sunning
themselves
on
the
top
these
crabs
were
round
us
in
thousands
i
counted
seven
watching
me
out
of
one
crack
between
two
rocks
we
sat
down
under
the
lee
of
the
summit
and
thought
it
would
not
be
bad
to
be
thrown
away
on
a
desert
island
little
thinking
how
near
we
were
to
being
stranded
for
a
time
at
any
rate
the
crabs
gathered
round
us
in
a
circle
with
their
eyes
turning
towards
us
as
if
they
were
waiting
for
us
to
die
to
come
and
eat
us
one
big
fellow
left
his
place
in
the
circle
and
waddled
up
to
my
feet
and
examined
my
boots
first
with
one
claw
and
then
with
the
other
he
took
a
taste
of
my
boot
he
went
away
obviously
disgusted
one
could
almost
see
him
shake
his
head
we
collected
as
well
as
our
birds
and
eggs
some
spiders
very
large
grasshoppers
cockchafers
with
big
and
small
centipedes
in
fact
the
place
teemed
with
insect
life
i
should
add
that
their
names
are
given
rather
from
the
general
appearance
of
the
animals
than
from
their
true
scientific
classes
we
had
a
big
and
fast
scramble
down
and
about
half
way
when
we
could
watch
the
sea
breaking
on
the
rocks
far
below
we
saw
that
there
was
a
bigger
swell
running
it
was
getting
late
and
we
made
our
way
down
as
fast
as
we
could
denting
our
guns
as
we
slipped
on
the
rocks
the
lower
we
got
the
bigger
the
sea
which
had
risen
in
our
absence
appeared
to
be
no
doubt
it
was
the
swell
of
a
big
disturbance
far
away
and
when
we
reached
the
débris
slope
where
we
had
landed
flanked
by
big
cliffs
we
found
everybody
gathered
there
and
the
boats
lying
off
it
being
quite
impossible
for
them
to
get
near
the
shore
they
had
just
got
a
ashore
on
a
buoy
bowers
went
out
on
to
the
rocks
and
secured
it
we
put
our
guns
and
specimens
into
a
pile
out
of
reach
as
we
thought
of
any
possible
sea
but
just
afterwards
two
very
large
waves
took
us
we
were
hauling
in
the
rope
and
must
have
been
a
good
thirty
feet
above
the
base
of
the
wave
it
hit
us
hard
and
knocked
us
all
over
the
place
and
wetted
the
guns
and
specimens
above
us
through
and
through
we
then
stowed
all
gear
and
specimens
well
out
of
the
reach
of
the
seas
and
then
went
out
through
the
surf
one
by
one
passing
ourselves
out
on
the
line
it
was
ticklish
work
but
hooper
was
the
only
one
who
really
had
a
bad
time
he
did
not
get
far
enough
out
among
the
rocks
which
fringed
the
steep
slope
from
which
he
started
as
a
wave
began
to
roll
back
the
next
wave
caught
him
and
crashed
him
back
and
he
let
go
of
the
line
he
was
under
quite
a
long
time
and
as
the
waves
washed
back
all
that
we
could
do
was
to
try
and
get
the
line
to
him
luckily
he
succeeded
in
finding
the
slack
of
the
line
and
got
out
when
we
first
got
down
to
the
shore
and
things
were
looking
nasty
wilson
sat
down
on
the
top
of
a
rock
and
ate
a
biscuit
in
the
coolest
possible
manner
it
was
an
example
to
avoid
all
panicking
for
he
did
not
want
the
biscuit
he
remarked
afterwards
to
me
apropos
to
hooper
that
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
a
number
of
men
knowing
that
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
could
quietly
watch
a
man
fighting
for
his
life
and
he
did
not
think
that
any
but
the
british
temperament
could
do
so
i
also
found
out
later
that
he
and
i
had
both
had
a
touch
of
cramp
while
waiting
for
our
turn
to
swim
out
through
the
surf
the
following
is
bowers
letter
the
past
week
has
been
so
crowded
with
incident
really
that
i
do
know
where
to
start
getting
to
land
made
me
long
for
the
mails
from
you
which
are
such
a
feature
of
getting
to
port
however
the
strange
uninhabited
island
which
we
visited
will
have
to
make
up
for
my
disappointment
till
we
get
to
capetown
or
rather
simon
town
campbell
and
i
sighted
trinidad
from
the
fore
yardarm
on
and
on
at
first
thing
in
the
morning
we
crept
up
to
an
anchorage
in
a
sea
of
glass
the
trades
making
a
considerable
sea
were
beating
on
the
eastern
sides
while
the
western
was
like
a
the
great
rocks
and
hills
to
over
feet
towered
above
us
as
we
went
in
very
close
in
order
to
get
our
anchor
down
as
the
water
is
very
deep
to
quite
a
short
distance
from
the
shore
west
bay
was
our
selection
and
so
clear
was
the
water
that
we
could
see
the
anchor
at
the
bottom
in
fathoms
a
number
of
sharks
and
other
fish
appeared
at
once
and
several
birds
evans
wanted
to
explore
so
oates
rennick
atkinson
and
myself
went
away
with
him
pulling
the
boat
we
examined
the
various
landings
and
found
them
all
rocky
and
dangerous
there
was
a
slight
surf
although
the
sea
looked
like
a
we
finally
decided
on
a
previously
unused
place
which
was
a
little
inlet
among
the
rocks
there
was
nothing
but
rock
but
there
was
a
little
nook
where
we
decided
to
try
and
land
we
returned
to
breakfast
and
found
that
wilson
and
had
shot
several
frigate
and
other
birds
from
the
ship
the
little
norwegian
boat
called
a
pram
being
used
to
pick
them
up
by
way
of
explanation
i
may
say
that
wilson
is
a
specialist
in
birds
and
is
making
a
collection
for
the
british
museum
we
all
landed
as
soon
as
possible
wilson
and
garrard
with
their
guns
for
birds
oates
with
the
dogs
and
atkinson
with
a
small
rifle
lillie
after
plants
and
geological
specimens
nelson
and
simpson
along
the
shore
after
sea
beasts
etc
and
last
but
not
least
came
the
entomological
party
under
yours
truly
with
wright
and
later
evans
as
assistants
pennell
joined
up
with
wilson
so
altogether
we
were
ready
to
the
island
i
have
taken
over
the
collection
of
insects
for
the
expedition
as
the
other
scientists
all
have
so
much
to
do
that
they
were
only
too
glad
to
shove
the
small
beasts
on
me
atkinson
is
a
specialist
in
parasites
it
is
called
i
never
heard
that
name
before
he
turns
out
the
interior
of
every
beast
that
is
killed
and
being
also
a
surgeon
i
suppose
the
subject
must
be
interesting
white
terns
abounded
on
the
island
they
were
and
so
tame
that
they
would
sit
on
one
hat
they
laid
their
eggs
on
pinnacles
of
rock
without
a
vestige
of
nest
and
singly
they
looked
just
like
stones
i
suppose
this
was
a
protection
from
the
about
which
you
will
have
heard
the
of
trinidad
are
a
byword
and
they
certainly
deserve
the
name
as
they
abound
from
to
the
top
of
the
island
the
higher
up
the
bigger
they
were
the
surface
of
the
hills
and
valleys
was
covered
with
loose
boulders
and
the
whole
island
being
of
volcanic
origin
coarse
grass
is
everywhere
and
at
about
feet
is
an
area
of
tree
ferns
and
subtropical
vegetation
extending
up
to
nearly
the
highest
parts
the
withered
trees
of
a
former
forest
are
everywhere
and
their
existence
unexplained
though
lillie
had
many
ingenious
theories
the
island
has
been
in
our
hands
the
germans
and
is
now
brazilian
nobody
has
been
able
to
settle
there
permanently
owing
to
the
these
also
exclude
mammal
life
captain
kidd
made
a
treasure
depôt
there
and
some
five
years
ago
a
chap
named
knight
lived
on
the
island
for
six
months
with
a
party
of
newcastle
miners
trying
to
get
at
it
he
had
the
place
all
right
but
a
huge
landslide
has
covered
up
of
a
million
of
the
pirate
gold
the
are
little
short
of
a
nightmare
they
peep
out
at
you
from
every
nook
and
boulder
their
dead
staring
eyes
follow
your
every
step
as
if
to
say
only
you
will
drop
down
we
will
do
the
rest
to
lie
down
and
sleep
on
any
part
of
the
island
would
be
suicidal
of
course
knight
had
a
specially
cleared
place
with
all
sorts
of
precautions
otherwise
he
would
never
have
survived
these
beasts
which
even
tried
to
nibble
your
boots
as
you
stood
staring
hard
at
you
the
whole
time
one
feature
that
would
soon
send
a
lonely
man
off
his
chump
is
that
no
matter
how
many
are
in
sight
they
are
all
looking
at
you
and
they
follow
step
by
step
with
a
sickly
deliberation
they
are
all
yellow
and
pink
and
next
to
spiders
seem
the
most
loathsome
creatures
on
god
earth
talking
about
spiders
bowers
always
had
the
greatest
horror
of
spiders
i
have
to
collect
them
as
well
as
insects
needless
to
say
i
caught
them
with
a
butterfly
net
and
never
touched
one
only
five
species
were
known
before
and
i
found
fifteen
or
more
at
any
rate
i
have
fifteen
for
certain
others
helped
me
to
catch
them
of
course
another
interesting
item
to
science
is
the
fact
that
i
caught
a
moth
hitherto
unknown
to
exist
on
the
island
also
various
flies
ants
etc
altogether
it
was
a
most
successful
day
wilson
got
dozens
of
birds
and
lillie
plants
etc
on
our
return
to
the
we
found
to
our
horror
that
a
southerly
swell
was
rolling
in
and
great
breakers
were
bursting
on
the
beach
about
five
we
all
collected
and
looked
at
the
whaler
and
pram
on
one
side
of
the
rollers
and
ourselves
on
the
other
first
it
was
impossible
to
take
off
the
guns
and
specimens
so
we
made
them
all
up
to
leave
for
the
morrow
second
a
sick
man
had
come
ashore
for
exercise
and
he
could
not
be
got
off
finally
atkinson
stayed
ashore
with
him
the
breakers
made
the
most
cauldron
in
our
little
nook
and
it
meant
a
tough
swim
for
all
of
us
three
of
us
swam
out
first
and
took
a
line
to
the
pram
and
finally
we
got
a
good
rope
from
the
whaler
which
had
anchored
well
out
to
the
shore
i
then
manoeuvred
the
pram
and
everybody
plunged
into
the
surf
and
hauled
himself
out
with
the
rope
all
well
but
minus
our
belongings
and
got
back
to
the
ship
very
wet
and
ravenous
was
a
mild
way
to
put
it
during
my
to
watch
that
night
the
surf
roared
like
thunder
and
the
ship
herself
was
rolling
like
anything
and
looked
horribly
close
to
the
shore
of
course
she
was
quite
safe
really
it
transpired
that
atkinson
and
the
seaman
had
a
horrible
night
with
salt
water
soaked
food
and
the
crabs
and
white
terns
which
sat
and
watched
them
all
night
squawking
in
chorus
whenever
they
moved
it
must
have
been
horrible
though
i
would
like
to
have
stayed
and
had
i
known
anybody
was
staying
would
have
volunteered
this
with
the
noise
of
the
surf
and
the
cold
made
it
pretty
rotten
for
them
in
the
morning
evans
rennick
oates
and
i
with
two
seamen
and
gran
took
the
whaler
and
pram
in
to
rescue
the
maroons
at
first
we
thought
we
would
do
it
by
a
rocket
line
to
the
end
of
the
sheer
cliff
the
impossibility
of
such
an
idea
was
at
once
evident
so
gran
and
i
went
in
close
in
the
pram
and
hove
them
lines
to
get
off
the
gear
first
i
found
the
pram
a
wonderful
boat
to
handle
you
could
go
in
to
the
very
edge
of
the
breaking
surf
lifted
like
a
cork
on
top
of
the
waves
and
as
long
as
you
kept
head
to
sea
and
kept
your
own
head
you
need
never
have
got
on
the
rocks
as
the
tremendous
took
you
out
like
a
shot
every
time
it
was
quite
exciting
however
as
we
would
slip
in
close
in
a
lull
and
the
chaps
in
the
whaler
would
yell
out
if
a
big
wave
passed
them
in
which
case
you
would
pull
out
for
dear
life
our
first
lines
carried
away
and
then
with
others
rennick
and
i
this
time
took
the
pram
while
atkinson
got
as
near
the
edge
as
safe
to
throw
us
the
gear
i
was
pulling
and
by
watching
our
chances
we
rescued
the
cameras
and
glasses
once
being
carried
over
feet
above
the
rocks
and
only
escaping
by
the
then
the
luckiest
incident
of
the
day
occurred
when
in
a
lull
we
got
our
sick
man
down
and
i
jumped
out
and
he
in
as
i
steadied
the
boat
stern
the
next
minute
the
boat
flew
out
on
the
with
the
seaman
absolutely
dry
and
i
was
of
course
enveloped
in
foam
and
blackness
two
seconds
later
by
a
following
wave
twice
the
day
before
this
had
happened
but
this
time
for
a
moment
i
thought
will
my
head
strike
as
i
was
like
a
feather
in
a
breeze
in
that
swirl
when
i
banked
it
was
about
feet
above
and
very
scratched
and
winded
i
clung
on
with
my
nails
and
scrambled
up
higher
the
next
wave
a
bigger
one
nearly
had
me
but
i
was
just
too
high
to
be
sucked
back
atkinson
and
i
then
started
getting
the
gear
down
evans
having
taken
my
place
in
the
pram
by
running
down
between
waves
we
hove
some
items
into
the
boat
including
the
guns
and
rifles
which
i
went
right
down
to
throw
these
were
caught
and
put
into
the
boat
but
evans
was
too
keen
to
save
a
bunch
of
boots
that
atkinson
threw
down
and
the
next
minute
the
pram
passed
over
my
head
and
landed
high
and
dry
like
a
bridge
over
the
rocks
between
which
i
was
wedged
i
then
scrambled
out
as
the
next
wave
washed
her
still
higher
right
over
and
over
with
evans
and
rennick
just
out
in
time
the
next
wave
a
huge
one
picked
her
up
and
out
she
bumped
over
the
rocks
and
out
to
sea
she
went
with
the
guns
fortunately
jammed
under
the
thwarts
she
was
rescued
by
the
whaler
baled
out
and
then
gran
and
one
of
the
seamen
manned
her
battered
remains
again
and
we
unable
to
save
the
gear
otherwise
lashed
it
to
threw
it
into
the
sea
and
let
it
drift
out
with
the
to
be
picked
up
by
the
pram
clothes
watches
and
ancient
guns
rifles
ammunition
birds
dead
and
all
specimens
were
with
the
basket
of
crockery
and
food
soaked
with
salt
water
however
the
choice
was
between
that
or
leaving
them
altogether
as
anybody
would
have
said
had
they
seen
the
huge
rollers
breaking
among
the
rocks
and
washing
to
feet
up
with
the
spray
in
fact
we
were
often
knocked
over
and
submerged
for
a
time
clinging
hard
to
some
rock
or
one
of
the
ropes
for
dear
life
evans
swam
off
first
then
i
was
about
half
an
hour
trying
to
rescue
a
hawser
and
some
lines
entangled
among
the
rocks
it
was
an
amusing
job
i
would
wait
for
a
lull
run
down
and
haul
away
staying
under
for
smaller
waves
and
running
up
the
rocks
like
a
hare
when
the
warning
came
from
the
boat
that
a
series
of
big
ones
were
coming
in
i
finally
rescued
most
of
it
had
to
cut
off
some
and
got
it
to
the
place
opposite
the
boat
and
with
rennick
secured
it
and
sent
it
out
to
sea
to
be
picked
up
my
pair
of
brown
tennis
shoes
old
ones
had
been
washed
off
my
feet
in
one
of
the
scrambles
so
i
was
wearing
a
pair
of
nelson
i
found
which
fortunately
for
him
was
one
of
the
few
pairs
saved
the
pram
came
in
and
waiting
for
a
rennick
swam
off
i
ran
down
after
the
following
wave
and
securing
my
green
hat
which
by
the
bye
is
a
most
useful
asset
struck
out
through
the
boiling
and
grabbed
the
pram
safely
as
we
were
lifted
on
the
crest
of
an
immense
roller
however
we
were
just
beyond
its
so
all
was
well
and
we
arrived
aboard
after
eight
hours
wash
and
wetness
and
none
the
worse
except
for
a
few
scratches
and
yours
truly
in
high
spirits
we
stayed
there
that
night
and
the
following
thursday
morning
left
winds
are
not
too
favourable
so
far
as
we
dropped
the
trades
almost
immediately
and
these
are
the
variables
between
the
trades
and
the
westerlies
still
miles
off
our
destination
evans
has
therefore
decided
to
steer
straight
for
simon
town
and
miss
out
the
other
islands
it
is
a
pity
but
as
it
is
winter
down
here
and
the
worst
month
of
the
year
for
storms
at
tristan
da
cunha
it
is
perhaps
just
as
well
i
am
longing
to
get
to
the
cape
to
have
your
letters
and
hear
all
about
you
except
for
the
absence
of
news
life
aboard
is
much
to
be
desired
i
simply
love
it
and
enjoy
every
day
of
my
existence
here
time
flies
like
anything
and
though
it
must
have
been
long
to
you
to
us
it
goes
like
the
wind
so
different
to
that
fortnight
on
the
passage
home
from
india
after
the
return
of
the
boat
crew
we
left
south
trinidad
and
the
zoologists
had
a
busy
time
trying
to
save
as
many
as
possible
of
the
bird
skins
which
had
been
procured
they
skinned
on
all
through
the
following
night
and
considering
that
the
birds
had
been
lying
out
in
the
tropics
for
hours
soaked
with
and
had
been
finally
capsized
in
the
overturned
boat
the
result
was
not
so
disappointing
as
was
expected
but
the
eggs
and
many
other
articles
were
lost
since
the
and
petrels
were
seen
flying
and
nesting
paired
together
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
their
former
classification
as
two
separate
species
will
have
to
be
revised
soon
after
leaving
south
trinidad
we
picked
up
our
first
big
long
swell
logged
at
and
began
to
learn
that
the
terra
nova
can
roll
as
few
ships
can
this
was
followed
by
a
stiff
gale
on
our
port
beam
and
we
took
over
our
first
green
seas
bowers
wrote
home
as
follows
all
chances
of
going
to
tristan
are
over
and
we
are
at
last
booming
along
with
strong
westerlies
with
the
enormous
southern
rollers
lifting
us
like
a
cork
on
their
crests
we
have
had
a
stiff
gale
and
a
very
high
sea
which
is
now
over
though
it
is
still
blowing
a
moderate
gale
and
the
usual
crowd
of
albatross
mollymawks
cape
hens
cape
pigeons
are
following
us
these
will
be
our
companions
down
to
the
south
wilson
idea
is
that
as
the
prevailing
winds
round
the
forties
are
westerlies
these
birds
simply
fly
round
and
round
the
world
via
cape
horn
new
zealand
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
we
have
had
a
really
good
opportunity
now
of
testing
the
ship
behaviour
having
been
becalmed
with
a
huge
beam
swell
rolling
each
way
and
having
stood
out
a
heavy
gale
with
a
high
sea
in
both
she
has
turned
up
trumps
and
really
i
think
a
better
little
sea
boat
never
floated
compared
to
the
loch
torridon
which
was
always
awash
in
bad
weather
we
are
as
dry
as
a
cork
and
never
once
shipped
a
really
heavy
sea
of
course
a
wooden
ship
has
some
buoyancy
of
herself
and
we
are
no
exception
we
are
certainly
an
exception
for
general
seaworthiness
if
not
for
speed
and
a
safer
sounder
ship
there
could
not
be
the
weather
is
now
cool
too
cold
some
people
call
it
i
am
still
comfortable
in
cotton
shirts
and
whites
while
some
are
wearing
shetland
gear
nearly
everybody
is
provided
with
shetland
things
i
am
glad
you
have
marked
mine
as
they
are
all
so
much
alike
i
am
certainly
as
well
provided
with
private
gear
as
anybody
and
far
better
than
most
so
being
as
well
a
generator
of
heat
in
myself
i
should
be
in
any
temperature
by
the
bye
evans
and
wilson
are
very
keen
on
my
being
in
the
western
party
while
campbell
wants
me
with
him
in
the
eastern
party
i
have
not
asked
to
go
ashore
but
am
keen
on
anything
and
am
ready
to
do
anything
in
fact
there
is
so
much
going
on
that
i
feel
i
should
like
to
be
in

sir
it
is
an
oilskinned
and
dripping
seaman
and
the
officer
of
the
watch
or
his
snotty
as
the
case
may
be
wakes
sufficiently
to
ask
what
it
like
two
hoops
sir
answers
the
seaman
and
makes
his
way
out
the
sleepy
man
who
has
been
wakened
wedges
himself
more
securely
into
his
six
foot
by
two
which
is
all
his
private
room
on
the
ship
and
collects
his
thoughts
amid
the
general
hubbub
of
engines
screw
and
the
roll
of
articles
which
have
worked
loose
to
consider
how
he
will
best
prevent
being
hurled
out
of
his
bunk
in
climbing
down
and
just
where
he
left
his
oilskins
and
if
as
is
possible
he
sleeps
in
the
nursery
his
task
may
not
be
so
simple
as
it
may
seem
for
this
cabin
which
proclaims
on
one
of
the
beams
that
it
is
designed
to
accommodate
four
seamen
will
house
six
scientists
or
in
addition
to
a
pianola
since
these
scientists
are
the
youngest
in
the
expedition
their
cabin
is
named
the
nursery
incidentally
it
forms
also
the
gangway
from
the
wardroom
to
the
from
which
it
is
divided
only
by
a
wooden
door
which
has
a
bad
habit
of
swinging
open
and
shutting
with
the
roll
of
the
ship
and
the
weight
of
the
oilskins
hung
upon
it
and
as
it
does
so
wave
upon
wave
the
clatter
of
the
engines
advances
and
recedes
if
however
it
is
the
officer
of
the
watch
he
will
be
in
a
smaller
cabin
farther
aft
which
he
shares
with
one
other
man
only
and
his
troubles
are
simplified
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
seams
in
the
deck
above
have
travelled
many
voyages
and
have
been
strained
in
addition
by
the
boat
davits
and
built
on
the
poop
a
good
deal
of
water
from
this
part
of
the
deck
which
is
always
awash
in
bad
weather
finds
its
way
below
that
is
into
the
upper
bunks
of
our
cabins
in
order
that
only
a
minimum
of
this
may
find
its
way
into
our
blankets
a
series
of
shoots
invented
and
carefully
tended
by
the
occupants
of
these
bunks
are
arranged
to
catch
this
water
as
it
falls
and
carry
it
over
our
heads
on
to
the
deck
of
the
cabin
thus
it
is
that
when
this
sleepy
officer
or
scientist
clambers
down
on
to
the
deck
he
will
if
he
is
lucky
find
the
water
there
instead
of
leaving
it
in
his
bunk
he
searches
round
for
his
gets

his

curses
if
the
strings
of
his
break
as
he
tries
to
tie
them
extra
firmly
round
his
neck
and
pushes
along
to
the
open
door
into
the
wardroom
it
is
still
quite
dark
for
the
sun
does
not
rise
for
another
hour
and
a
half
but
the
diminished
light
from
the
swinging
which
hangs
there
shows
him
a
desolate
early
morning
scene
which
he
comes
to
hate
especially
if
he
is
inclined
to
be
sick
as
likely
as
not
more
than
one
sea
has
partially
found
its
way
down
during
the
night
and
a
small
stream
runs
over
the
floor
each
time
the
ship
rolls
the
white
oilcloth
has
slipped
off
the
table
and
various
oddments
dirty
cocoa
cups
and
other
litter
from
the
night
are
rolling
about
too
the
tin
cups
and
plates
and
crockery
in
the
pantry
forrard
of
the
wardroom
come
together
with
a
sickening
crash
the
screw
keeps
up
a
ceaseless
pause
pause
watching
his
opportunity
he
slides
down
across
the
wet
linoleum
to
the
starboard
side
whence
the
gangway
runs
up
to
the
and
so
out
on
to
the
deck
having
glanced
at
the
barograph
slung
up
in
the
and
using
all
his
strength
to
force
the
door
out
enough
to
squeeze
through
he
scrambles
out
into
blackness
the
wind
is
howling
through
the
rigging
the
decks
are
awash
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
it
is
raining
for
the
spray
cut
off
by
the
wind
makes
rain
a
somewhat
insignificant
event
as
he
makes
his
way
up
on
to
the
bridge
not
a
very
lofty
climb
he
looks
to
see
what
sail
is
set
and
judges
so
far
as
he
can
the
force
of
the
wind
campbell
for
he
is
the
officer
of
the
morning
watch
has
a
talk
with
the
officer
he
is
relieving
bowers
he
is
given
the
course
the
last
hour
reading
on
the
cherub
patent
log
trailing
out
over
the
stern
and
the
experiences
of
the
middle
watch
of
the
wind
whether
rising
or
falling
or
squalling
and
its
effect
on
the
sails
and
the
ship
if
you
keep
her
on
her
present
course
she
all
right
but
if
you
try
and
bring
her
up
any
more
she
begins
to
shake
and
by
the
way
penelope
wants
to
be
called
at
bowers
who
is
oates
probably
makes
some
ribald
remarks
such
as
no
midshipman
should
to
a
full
lieutenant
and
they
both
disappear
below
campbell
snotty
myself
appears
about
five
minutes
afterwards
trying
to
look
as
though
some
important
duty
and
not
bed
had
kept
him
from
making
an
earlier
appearance
meanwhile
the
leading
hand
musters
the
watch
on
deck
and
reports
them
all
present
how
about
that
cocoa
says
campbell
cocoa
is
a
useful
thing
in
the
morning
watch
and
gran
who
used
to
be
campbell
snotty
and
whose
english
was
not
then
perfect
said
he
was
glad
of
a
change
because
he
did
not
like
being
turned
into
a
drumstick
he
meant
a
domestic
so
cocoa
is
the
word
and
the
snotty
starts
on
an
adventurous
voyage
over
the
deck
to
the
galley
which
is
forrard
if
he
is
unlucky
he
gets
a
sea
over
him
on
the
way
here
he
finds
the
hands
of
the
watch
smoking
and
keeping
warm
and
he
forages
round
for
some
hot
water
which
he
gets
safely
back
to
the
pantry
down
in
the
wardroom
here
he
mixes
the
cocoa
and
collects
sufficient
clean
mugs
if
he
can
find
them
spoons
sugar
and
biscuits
to
go
round
these
he
carefully
chocks
off
while
he
goes
and
calls
wilson
and
gives
him
his
share
for
wilson
gets
up
at
every
morning
to
sketch
the
sunrise
work
at
his
scientific
paintings
and
watch
the
flying
round
the
ship
then
back
to
the
bridge
and
woe
betide
him
if
he
falls
on
the
way
for
then
it
all
has
to
be
done
over
again
pennell
who
sleeps
under
the
chart
table
on
the
bridge
is
also
fed
and
inquires
anxiously
whether
there
are
any
stars
showing
if
there
are
he
is
up
immediately
to
get
an
observation
and
then
retires
below
to
work
it
out
and
to
tabulate
the
endless
masses
of
figures
which
go
to
make
up
the
results
of

luckily
the

is
just
turning

the

furled
luckily
they
are

the

reach
the

to
find
that
the

has
shifted
a

farther
aft
and
they
are
to
brace
round
this
finished
it
is
broad
daylight
and
the
men
set
to
work
to
coil
up
preparatory
to
washing
decks
not
that
this
would
seem
very
necessary
certainly
there
is
no
hose
wanted
this
morning
and
a
general
kind
of
tidying
up

coiling
down

is
more
what
is
done

when

their
wives
to

come
on
nelson
it
seven
all
hands
on
the
pumps
from
first
to
last
these
pumps
were
a
source
of
much
exercise
and
hearty
curses
a
wooden
ship
always
leaks
a
little
but
the
amount
of
water
taken
in
by
the
terra
nova
even
in
calm
weather
was
extraordinary
and
could
not
be
traced
until
the
ship
was
in
lyttelton
new
zealand
and
the
forepart
was
flooded
in
the
meantime
the
ship
had
to
be
kept
as
dry
as
possible
a
process
which
was
not
facilitated
by
forty
gallons
of
oil
which
got
loose
during
the
rough
weather
after
leaving
south
trinidad
and
found
its
way
into
the
bilges
as
we
found
later
some
stevedore
had
left
one
of
the
bottom
boards
only
into
its
neighbours
in
consequence

coal
dust
and
small
pieces
of
coal
which
was
stowed
in
this
hold
found
their
way
into
the
bilges
forty
gallons
of
oil
completed
the
havoc
and
the
pumps
would
gradually
get
more
and
more
blocked
until
it
was
necessary
to
send
for
davies
the
carpenter
to
take
parts
of
them
to
pieces
and
clear
out
the
oily
coal
balls
which
had
stopped
them
this
pumping
would
sometimes
take
till
nearly
eight
and
then
would
always
have
to
be
repeated
again
in
the
evening
and
sometimes
every
watch
had
to
take
a
turn
at
any
rate
it
was
good
for
our
muscles
the
pumps
were
placed
amidships
just
abaft
the
main
mast
and
ran
down
a
shaft
adjoining
the
after
hatch
which
led
into
the
holds
which
were
generally
used
for
coal
and
patent
fuel
the
spout
of
the
pump
opened
about
a
foot
above
the
deck
and
the
plungers
were
worked
by
means
of
two
horizontal
handles
much
as
a
bucket
is
wound
up
on
the
drum
of
a
cottage
well
unfortunately
this
part
of
the
main
deck
which
is
just
forward
of
the
break
of
the
poop
is
more
subject
to
seas
breaking
inboard
than
any
other
part
of
the
ship
so
when
the
ship
was
labouring
the
task
of
those
on
the
pump
was
not
an
enviable
one
during
the
big
gale
going
south
the
water
was
up
to
the
men
waists
as
they
tried
to
turn
the
handles
and
the
pumps
themselves
were
feet
under
water
from
england
to
cape
town
these
small
handles
were
a
great
inconvenience
there
was
very
much
pumping
to
be
done
and
there
were
plenty
of
men
to
do
it
but
the
handles
were
not
long
enough
to
allow
more
than
four
men
to
each
handle
also
they
gave
no
secure
purchase
when
the
ship
was
rolling
heavily
and
when
a
big
roll
came
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
practically
stop
pumping
and
hold
on
or
you
found
yourself
in
the
scuppers
at
cape
town
a
great
improvement
was
made
by
extending
the
crank
handles
right
across
the
decks
the
outside
end
turning
in
a
socket
under
the
rail
fourteen
men
could
then
get
a
good
purchase
on
the
handles
and
pumping
became
a
more
pleasant
exercise
and
less
of
a
nuisance
periodically
the
well
was
sounded
by
an
iron
rod
being
lowered
on
the
end
of
a
rope
by
which
the
part
that
came
up
wet
showed
the
depth
of
water
left
in
the
bilge
when
this
had
been
reduced
to
about
a
foot
in
the
well
the
ship
was
practically
dry
and
the
afterguard
free
to
bathe
and
go
to
breakfast
meanwhile
the
hands
of
the
watch
had
been
employed
on
ropes
and
sails
as
the
wind
made
necessary
and
when
running
under
steam
as
well
as
sail
hoisting
ashes
up
the
two
shoots
from
the
of
the
furnaces
to
the
deck
whence
they
went
into
the
ditch
it
is
eight
bells
and
the
two
stewards
are
hurrying
along
the
decks
hoping
to
get
the
breakfast
safely
from
galley
to
wardroom
a
few
naked
officers
are
pouring
over
their
heads
on
deck
for
we
are
under
sail
alone
and
there
is
no
steam
to
work
the
hose
the
watch
keepers
and
their
snotties
of
the
night
before
are
tumbling
out
of
their
bunks
and
a
great
noise
of
conversation
is
coming
from
the
wardroom
among
which
some
such
remarks
as
give
the
jam
a
wind
marie
after
you
with
the
coffee
push
along
the
butter
are
frequent
there
are
few
cobwebs
that
have
not
been
blown
away
by
rennick

breakfasting
preparatory
to

on

meanwhile
the

is
being
made

of

of
the

of

all
the
details
which
a
log
has
to
carry
including
a
reading
of
the
distance
run
as
shown
by
the
patent
log
line
many
is
the
time
i
have
forgotten
to
take
it
just
at
the
hour
and
have
put
down
what
i
thought
it
ought
to
be
and
not
what
it
was
the
morning
watch
is
finished
suddenly
there
is
a
yell
from
somewhere
amidships
steady
a
stranger
might
have
thought
there
was
something
wrong
but
it
is
a
familiar
sound
answered
by
a
steady
it
is
sir
from
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
an
anything
but
respectful
one
two
three
steady
from
everybody
having
breakfast
it
is
pennell
who
has
caused
this
uproar
and
the
origin
is
as
follows
pennell
is
the
navigator
and
the
standard
compass
owing
to
its
remoteness
from
iron
in
this
position
is
placed
on
the
top
of
the
the
steersman
however
steers
by
a
binnacle
compass
placed
aft
in
front
of
his
wheel
but
these
two
compasses
for
various
reasons
do
not
read
alike
at
a
given
moment
while
the
standard
is
the
truer
of
the
two
at
intervals
then
pennell
or
the
officer
of
the
watch
orders
the
steersman
to
stand
by
for
a
steady
and
goes
up
to
the
standard
compass
and
watches
the
needle
suppose
the
course
laid
down
is
a
liner
would
steer
almost
true
to
this
course
unless
there
was
a
big
wind
or
sea
but
not
so
the
old
terra
nova
even
with
a
good
steersman
the
needle
swings
a
good
many
degrees
either
side
of
the
but
as
it
steadies
momentarily
on
the
exact
course
pennell
shouts
his
steady
the
steersman
reads
just
where
the
needle
is
pointing
on
the
compass
card
before
him
say
and
knows
that
this
is
the
course
which
is
to
be
steered
by
the
binnacle
compass
pennell
yells
were
so
frequent
and
that
he
became
famous
for
them
and
many
times
in
working
on
the
ropes
in
rough
seas
and
big
winds
we
have
been
cheered
by
this
unmusical
noise
over
our
heads
we
left
simon
bay
on
friday
september
make
our
easting
from
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
new
zealand
that
famous
passage
in
the
roaring
forties
which
can
give
so
much
discomfort
or
worse
to
sailing
ships
on
their
way
south
africa
had
been
hospitable
the
admiral
commanding
the
station
the
naval
dockyard
and
mutine
and
pandora
had
been
more
than
kind
they
had
done
many
repairs
and
fittings
for
us
and
had
sent
fatigue
parties
to
do
it
thus
releasing
men
for
a
certain
amount
of
freedom
on
shore
which
was
appreciated
after
some
nine
weeks
at
sea
i
can
remember
my
first
long
bath
now
scott
who
was
up
country
when
we
arrived
joined
the
ship
here
and
wilson
travelled
ahead
of
us
to
melbourne
to
carry
out
some
expedition
work
chiefly
dealing
with
the
australian
members
who
were
to
join
us
in
new
zealand
one
or
two
of
us
went
out
to
wynberg
which
oates
knew
well
having
been
invalided
there
in
the
south
african
war
with
a
broken
leg
the
result
of
a
fight
against
big
odds
when
his
whole
party
wounded
he
refused
to
surrender
he
told
me
later
how
he
had
thought
he
would
bleed
to
death
and
the
man
who
lay
next
to
him
was
convinced
he
had
a
bullet
in
the
middle
of
his
brain
he
could
feel
it
wobbling
about
there
just
now
his
recollections
only
went
so
far
as
to
tell
of
a
badly
wounded
boer
who
lay
in
the
next
bed
to
him
when
he
was
convalescent
and
how
the
boer
insisted
on
getting
up
to
open
the
door
for
him
every
time
he
left
the
ward
much
to
his
own
discomfort
otherwise
the
recollections
which
survive
of
south
africa
are
an
excellent
speech
made
on
the
expedition
by
john
xavier
merriman
and
the
remark
of
a
seaman
who
came
out
to
dinner
concerning
one
john
the
waiter
that
he
moved
about
as
quick
as
a
piece
of
leaving
simon
town
at
daybreak
we
did
magnetic
work
all
day
sailing
out
from
false
bay
with
a
biggish
swell
in
the
evening
we
ran
southerly
in
good
weather
until
sunday
morning
when
the
swell
was
logged
at
and
the
glass
was
falling
fast
by
the
middle
watch
it
was
blowing
a
full
gale
and
for
some
thirty
hours
we
ran
under
reefed
foresail
lower
topsails
and
occasionally
reefed
upper
topsails
and
many
of
us
were
sick
then
after
two
days
of
comparative
calm
we
had
a
most
extraordinary
gale
from
the
east
a
thing
almost
unheard
of
in
these
latitudes
to
all
that
we
could
do
was
to
put
the
engines
at
dead
slow
and
sail
northerly
as
close
to
the
wind
as
possible
friday
night
september
it
blew
force
in
the
night
and
the
morning
watch
was
very
lively
with
the
lee
rail
under
water
directly
after
breakfast
on
saturday
september
we
wore
ship
and
directly
afterwards
the
gale
broke
and
it
was
raining
with
little
wind
during
the
day
the
morning
watch
had
a
merry
time
on
tuesday
september
when
a
fresh
gale
struck
them
while
they
were
squaring
yards
so
unexpected
was
it
that
the
main
yards
were
squared
and
the
fore
were
still
round
but
it
did
not
last
long
and
was
followed
by
two
splendid
days
fine
weather
with
sun
a
good
fair
wind
and
the
swell
astern
illustration
the
roaring
forties
wilson
del
the
big
swell
which
so
often
prevails
in
these
latitudes
is
a
most
inspiring
sight
and
must
be
seen
from
a
comparatively
small
ship
like
the
terra
nova
for
its
magnitude
to
be
truly
appreciated
as
the
ship
rose
on
the
crest
of
one
great
hill
of
water
the
next
big
ridge
was
nearly
a
mile
away
with
a
sloping
valley
between
at
times
these
seas
are
rounded
in
giant
slopes
as
smooth
as
glass
at
others
they
curl
over
leaving
a
foam
and
their
slopes
are
marbled
with
a
beautiful
spumy
tracery
very
wonderful
are
these
mottled
waves
with
a
following
sea
at
one
moment
it
seems
impossible
that
the
great
mountain
which
is
overtaking
the
ship
will
not
overwhelm
her
at
another
it
appears
inevitable
that
the
ship
will
fall
into
the
space
over
which
she
seems
to
be
suspended
and
crash
into
the
gulf
which
lies
below
but
the
seas
are
so
long
that
they
are
neither
dangerous
nor
uncomfortable
though
the
terra
nova
rolled
to
an
extraordinary
extent
quite
constantly
over
each
way
and
sometimes
the
cooks
however
had
a
bad
time
trying
to
cook
for
some
fifty
hands
in
the
little
galley
on
the
open
deck
poor
archer
efforts
to
make
bread
sometimes
ended
in
the
scuppers
and
the
occasional
jangle
of
the
bell
gave
rise
to
the
saying
that
a
moderate
roll
rings
the
bell
and
a
big
roll
brings
out
the
cook
noon
on
sunday
september
found
us
in
latitude
and
longitude
after
a
very
good
run
for
the
terra
nova
of
miles
in
the
last
hours
this
made
us
about
two
days
run
from
paul
an
uninhabited
island
formed
by
the
remains
of
an
old
volcano
the
crater
of
which
surrounded
as
it
were
by
a
of
land
forms
an
almost
landlocked
harbour
it
was
hoped
to
make
a
landing
here
for
scientific
work
but
it
is
a
difficult
harbour
to
make
we
ran
another
two
hundred
miles
on
monday
and
on
tuesday
all
preparations
were
made
for
the
landing
with
suitable
equipment
and
we
were
not
a
little
excited
at
the
opportunity
at
the
next
morning
all
hands
were
turned
out
to
take
in
sail
preparatory
to
rounding
paul
which
was
just
visible
the
weather
was
squally
but
not
bad
by
however
it
was
blowing
a
moderate
gale
and
by
the
time
we
had
taken
in
all
sail
we
had
to
give
up
hopes
of
a
landing
we
were
thoroughly
sick
of
sails
by
the
time
we
finally
reefed
the
foresail
and
ran
before
the
wind
under
this
and
lower
topsails
we
passed
quite
close
to
the
island
and
could
see
into
the
crater
and
the
cliffs
beyond
which
rose
from
it
covered
with
greenish
grass
there
were
no
trees
and
of
birds
we
only
saw
those
which
frequent
these
seas
we
had
hoped
to
find
penguins
and
albatross
nesting
on
the
island
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
this
failure
to
land
was
most
disappointing
the
island
is
feet
high
and
for
its
size
precipitous
it
extends
some
two
miles
in
length
and
one
mile
in
breadth
the
following
day
all
the
afterguard
were
turned
on
to
shift
coal
it
should
be
explained
that
up
to
this
time
the
bunkers
which
lay
one
on
the
port
and
the
other
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
furnaces
had
been
entirely
filled
as
required
by
two
or
more
officers
who
volunteered
from
day
to
day
we
took
on
board
tons
of
crown
patent
fuel
at
cardiff
in
june
this
coal
is
in
the
form
of
bricks
and
is
most
handy
since
it
can
be
thrown
by
hand
from
the
holds
through
the
bunker
doors
in
the
bulkhead
which
after
a
time
was
left
higher
than
the
sinking
level
of
the
coal
the
coal
to
be
landed
was
this
patent
fuel
and
it
was
now
decided
to
shift
farther
aft
all
the
patent
fuel
which
was
left
and
stack
it
against
the
bulkhead
the
coal
which
was
originally
there
having
been
fed
to
the
furnaces
thus
the
dust
which
was
finding
its
way
through
the
floorboards
and
choking
the
pumps
could
be
swept
up
and
a
good
stow
could
be
made
preparatory
to
the
final
in
new
zealand
while
the
coal
which
was
to
be
taken
on
board
at
lyttelton
could
be
loaded
through
the
main
hatch
in
the
meantime
the
gale
which
had
sprung
up
six
days
before
and
prevented
us
landing
had
died
down
after
leaving
paul
we
had
let
the
fires
out
and
run
under
sail
alone
and
the
following
two
days
we
ran
and
miles
respectively
being
practically
becalmed
at
times
on
the
following
day
and
only
running
miles
by
tuesday
night
september
we
had
finished
the
coaling
and
we
celebrated
the
occasion
by
a
champagne
dinner
at
the
same
time
we
raised
steam
scott
was
anxious
to
push
on
and
so
indeed
was
everybody
else
but
the
wind
was
not
disposed
to
help
us
and
headed
us
a
good
deal
during
the
next
few
days
and
it
was
not
until
october
that
we
were
able
to
set
all
plain
sail
in
the
morning
watch
this
absence
of
westerly
winds
in
a
region
in
which
they
are
usually
too
strong
for
comfort
was
explained
by
pennell
by
a
theory
that
we
were
travelling
in
an
anticyclone
which
itself
was
travelling
in
front
of
a
cyclone
behind
us
we
were
probably
moving
under
steam
about
the
same
pace
as
the
disturbance
which
would
average
some
miles
a
day
from
this
may
be
explained
many
of
the
reports
of
continual
bad
weather
met
by
sailing
ships
and
steamers
in
these
latitudes
if
we
had
been
a
sailing
ship
without
auxiliary
steam
the
cyclone
would
have
caught
us
up
and
we
should
have
been
travelling
with
it
and
consequently
in
continual
bad
weather
on
the
other
hand
a
steamer
pure
and
simple
would
have
steamed
through
good
and
bad
alike
but
we
with
our
auxiliary
steam
only
made
much
the
same
headway
as
the
disturbance
travelling
in
our
wake
and
so
remained
in
the
anticyclone
physical
observations
were
made
on
the
outward
voyage
by
simpson
and
wright
into
the
atmospheric
electricity
over
the
ocean
one
set
of
which
consisted
of
an
inquiry
into
the
potential
gradient
and
observations
were
undertaken
at
melbourne
for
the
determination
of
the
absolute
value
of
the
potential
gradient
over
the
sea
numerous
observations
were
also
made
on
the
radium
content
of
the
atmosphere
over
the
ocean
to
be
compared
afterwards
with
observations
in
the
antarctic
air
the
variations
in
radium
content
were
not
large
results
were
also
obtained
on
the
voyage
of
the
terra
nova
to
new
zealand
upon
the
subject
of
natural
ionization
in
closed
vessels
in
addition
to
the
work
of
the
ship
and
the
physical
work
above
mentioned
work
in
vertebrate
zoology
marine
biology
and
magnetism
together
with
observations
of
the
salinity
and
temperature
of
the
sea
was
carried
out
during
the
whole
voyage
in
vertebrate
zoology
wilson
kept
an
accurate
record
of
birds
and
he
and
lillie
another
record
of
whales
and
dolphins
all
the
birds
which
could
be
caught
both
at
sea
and
on
south
trinidad
island
were
skinned
and
made
up
into
museum
specimens
they
were
also
examined
for
external
and
internal
parasites
by
wilson
atkinson
and
myself
as
were
also
such
fish
and
other
animals
as
could
be
caught
including
flying
fish
a
shark
and
last
but
not
least
whales
in
new
zealand
the
method
of
catching
these
birds
may
be
worth
describing
a
bent
nail
was
tied
to
a
line
the
other
end
of
which
was
made
fast
to
the
halyards
over
the
stern
sufficient
length
of
line
was
allowed
either
to
cause
the
nail
to
just
trail
in
the
sea
in
the
wake
of
the
ship
or
for
the
line
to
just
clear
the
sea
thus
when
the
halyard
was
hoisted
to
some
thirty
or
forty
feet
above
the
deck
the
line
would
be
covering
a
considerable
distance
of
sea
the
birds
flying
round
the
ship
congregate
for
the
main
part
in
the
wake
for
here
they
find
the
scraps
thrown
overboard
on
which
they
feed
i
have
seen
six
albatross
all
together
trying
to
eat
up
an
empty
treacle
tin
as
they
fly
to
and
fro
their
wings
are
liable
to
touch
the
line
which
is
spread
out
over
the
sea
sometimes
they
will
hit
the
line
with
the
tips
of
their
wings
and
then
there
is
no
resulting
capture
but
sooner
or
later
a
bird
will
touch
the
line
with
the
part
of
the
wing
above
the
humerus
it
seems
that
on
feeling
the
contact
the
bird
suddenly
wheels
in
the
air
thereby
causing
a
loop
in
the
line
which
tightens
round
the
bone
at
any
rate
the
next
thing
that
happens
is
that
the
bird
is
struggling
on
the
line
and
may
be
hauled
on
board
the
difficulty
is
to
get
a
line
which
is
light
enough
to
fly
in
the
air
but
yet
strong
enough
to
hold
the
large
birds
such
as
albatross
without
breaking
we
tried
fishing
line
with
no
success
but
eventually
managed
to
buy
some
extra
strong
cobbler
thread
which
is
excellent
for
the
purpose
but
we
wanted
not
only
specimens
but
also
observations
of
the
species
the
numbers
which
appeared
and
their
habits
for
little
is
known
as
yet
of
these
sea
birds
and
so
we
enlisted
the
help
of
all
who
were
interested
and
it
may
be
said
that
all
the
officers
and
many
of
the
seamen
had
a
hand
in
producing
the
log
of
sea
birds
to
which
additions
were
made
almost
hourly
throughout
the
daylight
hours
most
officers
and
men
knew
the
more
common
sea
birds
in
the
open
ocean
and
certainly
of
those
in
the
pack
and
fringes
of
the
antarctic
continent
which
with
rare
exceptions
is
the
southern
limit
of
bird
life
a
number
of
observations
of
whales
illustrated
by
wilson
were
made
but
the
results
so
far
as
the
seas
from
england
to
the
cape
and
new
zealand
are
concerned
are
not
of
great
importance
partly
because
close
views
were
seldom
obtained
and
partly
because
the
whales
inhabiting
these
seas
are
fairly
well
known
on
october
in
latitude
and
longitude
two
adults
of
balaenoptera
borealis
northern
rorqual
were
following
the
ship
close
under
the
counter
length
feet
with
a
calf
some
feet
long
swimming
with
them
it
was
established
by
this
and
by
a
later
observation
in
new
zealand
when
lillie
helped
to
cut
up
a
similar
whale
at
the
norwegian
whaling
station
at
the
bay
of
islands
that
this
rorqual
which
frequents
the
seas
is
identical
with
our
northern
rorqual
but
this
was
the
only
close
observation
of
any
whales
obtained
before
we
left
new
zealand
general
information
with
regard
to
such
animals
is
useful
however
as
showing
the
relative
abundance
of
plankton
on
which
the
whales
feed
in
the
ocean
there
are
for
instance
more
whales
in
the
antarctic
than
in
warmer
seas
and
some
whales
at
any
rate
humpback
whales
probably
come
north
into
warmer
waters
in
the
winter
rather
for
breeding
purposes
than
to
get
food
with
regard
to
dolphins
four
species
were
observed
beyond
question
the
rarest
dolphin
seen
was
tersio
peronii
the
peculiarity
of
which
is
that
it
has
no
dorsal
fin
this
was
seen
on
october
in
latitude
and
longitude
reports
of
whales
and
dolphins
which
are
not
based
upon
carcases
and
skeletons
must
be
accepted
with
caution
it
is
most
difficult
to
place
species
with
scientific
accuracy
which
can
only
be
observed
swimming
in
the
water
and
of
which
more
often
than
not
only
blows
and
the
dorsal
fins
can
be
observed
the
nomenclature
of
dolphins
especially
leaves
much
to
be
desired
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
some
expedition
in
the
future
will
carry
a
norwegian
harpooner
who
could
do
other
work
as
well
since
they
are
very
good
sailors
wilson
was
strongly
of
this
opinion
and
tried
hard
to
get
a
harpooner
but
they
are
expensive
people
so
long
as
the
present
boom
in
whaling
lasts
and
perhaps
it
was
on
the
score
of
expense
that
the
idea
was
regretfully
abandoned
we
carried
whaling
gear
formerly
taken
on
the
discovery
expedition
and
kindly
lent
for
this
expedition
by
the
royal
geographical
society
of
london
a
few
shots
were
tried
but
an
unskilled
harpooner
stands
very
little
chance
if
you
go
whaling
you
must
have
had
experience
the
ship
was
not
slowed
down
to
enable
marine
biological
observations
to
be
taken
on
this
part
of
the
expedition
but
something
like
forty
samples
of
plankton
were
taken
with
a
net
we
were
unable
to
trawl
on
the
bottom
until
we
reached
melbourne
when
a
trawl
was
made
in
port
phillip
harbour
to
try
the
gear
and
accustom
men
to
its
use
it
was
not
a
purpose
of
the
expedition
to
spend
time
in
work
until
it
reached
antarctic
seas
for
four
days
the
wind
such
as
there
was
of
it
was
dead
ahead
it
is
not
very
often
in
the
forties
that
a
ship
can
not
make
progress
for
want
of
wind
but
having
set
all
plain
sail
on
october
with
a
falling
glass
we
got
a
certain
amount
of
wind
on
the
port
beam
and
did
miles
in
the
next
hours
sunday
being
quiet
scott
read
service
while
the
officers
and
men
grouped
round
the
wheel
we
seldom
had
service
on
deck
for
sundays
became
proverbial
days
for
a
blow
on
the
way
out
and
service
if
held
at
all
was
generally
in
the
on
one
famous
occasion
we
tried
to
play
the
pianola
to
accompany
the
hymns
but
since
the
rolls
were
scored
rather
for
musical
effect
than
for
church
services
the
pianola
was
suddenly
found
to
be
playing
something
quite
different
from
what
was
being
sung
all
through
the
expedition
the
want
of
some
one
who
could
play
the
piano
was
felt
and
such
a
man
is
certainly
a
great
asset
in
a
life
so
far
removed
from
all
the
pleasures
of
civilization
as
scott
wrote
in
the
voyage
of
the
discovery
where
one
of
the
officers
used
to
play
each
evening
this
hour
of
music
has
become
an
institution
which
none
of
us
would
willingly
forgo
i
do
know
what
thoughts
it
brings
to
others
though
i
can
readily
guess
but
of
such
things
one
does
not
care
to
write
i
can
well
believe
however
that
our
music
smooths
over
many
a
ruffle
and
brings
us
to
dinner
each
night
in
that
excellent
humour
where
all
seem
though
for
action
and
ready
for
fresh
argument
the
wind
freshened
to
our
joy
scott
was
impatient
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
the
time
for
doing
it
was
not
too
long
for
it
had
been
decided
to
leave
new
zealand
at
an
earlier
date
than
had
been
attempted
by
any
previous
expedition
in
order
to
penetrate
the
pack
sooner
and
make
an
early
start
on
the
depôt
journey
the
faintest
glow
of
the
aurora
australis
which
was
to
become
so
familiar
to
us
was
seen
at
this
time
but
what
aroused
still
more
interest
was
the
capture
of
several
albatross
on
the
lines
flowing
out
over
the
stern
the
first
was
a
cornicoides
we
put
him
down
on
the
deck
where
he
strutted
about
in
the
proudest
way
his
feet
going
flop
flop
flop
as
he
walked
he
was
a
most
beautiful
bird
sooty
black
body
a
great
black
head
with
a
line
of
white
over
each
eye
and
a
gorgeous
violet
line
running
along
his
black
beak
he
treated
us
with
the
greatest
contempt
which
from
such
a
beautiful
creature
we
had
every
appearance
of
deserving
another
day
a
little
later
we
caught
a
wandering
albatross
a
albatross
and
a
sooty
albatross
all
together
and
set
them
on
the
deck
tethered
to
the
ventilators
while
their
photographs
were
taken
they
were
such
beautiful
birds
that
we
were
loath
to
kill
them
but
their
value
as
scientific
specimens
outweighed
the
wish
to
set
them
free
and
we
gave
them
ether
so
that
they
did
not
suffer
the
southern
ocean
is
the
home
of
these
and
many
species
of
birds
but
among
them
the
albatross
is
it
has
been
mentioned
that
wilson
believed
that
the
albatross
at
any
rate
fly
round
and
round
the
world
over
these
stormy
seas
before
the
westerly
winds
landing
but
once
a
year
on
such
islands
as
kerguelen
paul
the
auckland
islands
and
others
to
breed
if
so
the
rest
that
they
can
obtain
upon
the
big
breaking
rollers
which
prevail
in
these
latitudes
must
be
unsatisfactory
judged
by
the
standard
of
more
civilized
birds
i
have
watched
sea
birds
elsewhere
of
which
the
same
individuals
appeared
to
follow
the
ship
day
after
day
for
many
thousands
of
miles
but
on
this
voyage
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
different
set
of
birds
appeared
each
morning
and
that
they
were
hungry
when
they
arrived
certainly
they
flew
astern
and
nearer
to
the
ship
in
the
morning
feeding
on
the
scraps
thrown
overboard
as
the
day
went
on
and
the
birds
hunger
was
satisfied
they
scattered
and
such
of
them
as
continued
to
fly
astern
of
the
ship
were
a
long
way
off
hence
we
caught
the
birds
in
the
early
morning
and
only
one
bird
was
caught
after
the
wind
continued
favourable
and
was
soon
blowing
quite
hard
on
friday
october
we
were
doing
knots
under
sail
alone
which
was
very
good
for
the
old
terra
push
as
she
was
familiarly
called
and
we
were
then
just
miles
from
melbourne
by
saturday
night
we
were
standing
by
topgallant
halyards
campbell
took
over
the
watch
at
on
sunday
morning
it
was
blowing
hard
and
squally
but
the
ship
still
carried
topgallants
there
was
a
big
following
sea
at
there
occurred
one
of
those
incidents
of
sea
life
which
are
interesting
though
not
important
quite
suddenly
the
first
really
big
squall
we
had
experienced
on
the
voyage
struck
us
topgallant
halyards
were
let
go
and
the
fore
topgallant
yard
came
down
but
the
main
topgallant
yard
jammed
when
only
half
down
it
transpired
afterwards
that
a
gasket
which
had
been
blown
over
the
yard
had
fouled
the
block
of
the
sheet
of
the
main
upper
topsail
the
topgallant
yard
was
all
tilted
to
starboard
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
the
sail
seemed
as
though
it
might
blow
out
at
any
moment
and
was
making
a
noise
like
big
guns
and
the
mast
was
shaking
badly
it
was
expected
that
the
topgallant
mast
would
go
but
nothing
could
be
done
while
the
full
fury
of
the
wind
lasted
campbell
paced
quietly
up
and
down
the
bridge
with
a
smile
on
his
face
the
watch
was
grouped
round
the
ratlines
ready
to
go
aloft
and
crean
volunteered
to
go
up
alone
and
try
and
free
the
yard
but
permission
was
refused
it
was
touch
and
go
with
the
mast
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
squall
passed
the
sail
was
freed
and
furled
and
the
next
big
squall
found
us
ready
to
lower
upper
topsails
and
all
was
well
finally
the
damage
was
a
split
sail
and
a
strained
mast
the
next
morning
a
new
topgallant
sail
was
bent
but
quite
the
biggest
hailstorm
i
have
ever
seen
came
on
in
the
middle
of
the
operation
much
of
the
hail
must
have
been
inches
in
circumference
and
hurt
even
through
thick
clothes
and
oilskins
at
the
same
time
there
were
several
waterspouts
formed
the
men
on
the
topgallant
yard
had
a
beastly
time
below
on
deck
men
made
and
pretended
they
were
snow
from
now
onwards
we
ran
on
our
course
before
a
gale
by
the
early
morning
of
october
cape
otway
light
was
in
sight
working
double
tides
in
the
and
with
every
stitch
of
sail
set
we
just
failed
to
reach
port
phillip
heads
by
when
the
tide
turned
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
through
we
went
up
melbourne
harbour
that
evening
very
dark
and
blowing
hard
a
telegram
was
waiting
for
scott
madeira
am
going
south
amundsen
this
telegram
was
dramatically
important
as
will
appear
when
we
come
to
the
last
act
of
the
tragedy
captain
roald
amundsen
was
one
of
the
most
notable
of
living
explorers
and
was
in
the
prime
of
life
two
years
younger
than
scott
he
had
been
in
the
antarctic
before
scott
with
the
belgica
expedition
in
and
therefore
did
not
consider
the
south
pole
in
any
sense
our
property
since
then
he
had
realized
the
dream
of
centuries
of
exploration
by
passing
through
the
passage
and
actually
doing
so
in
a
schooner
in
the
last
we
had
heard
of
him
was
that
he
had
equipped
nansen
old
ship
the
fram
for
further
exploration
in
the
arctic
this
was
only
a
feint
once
at
sea
he
had
told
his
men
that
he
was
going
south
instead
of
north
and
when
he
reached
madeira
he
sent
this
brief
telegram
which
meant
i
shall
be
at
the
south
pole
before
you
it
also
meant
though
we
did
not
appreciate
it
at
the
time
that
we
were
up
against
a
very
big
man
the
admiral
commanding
the
australian
station
came
on
board
the
event
of
the
inspection
was
nigger
the
black
ship
cat
distinguished
by
a
white
whisker
on
the
port
side
of
his
face
who
made
one
adventurous
voyage
to
the
antarctic
and
came
to
an
untimely
end
during
the
second
the
seamen
made
a
hammock
for
him
with
blanket
and
pillow
and
slung
it
forward
among
their
own
bedding
nigger
had
turned
in
not
feeling
very
well
owing
to
the
number
of
moths
he
had
eaten
the
ship
being
full
of
them
when
awakened
by
the
admiral
nigger
had
no
idea
of
the
importance
of
the
occasion
but
stretched
himself
yawned
in
the
most
natural
manner
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
again
this
cat
became
a
and
much
photographed
member
of
the
crew
of
the
terra
nova
he
is
said
to
have
imitated
the
romans
of
old
being
a
greedy
beast
by
having
eaten
as
much
seal
blubber
as
he
could
hold
made
himself
sick
and
gone
back
and
resumed
his
meal
he
had
most
beautiful
fur
when
the
ship
was
returning
from
the
antarctic
in
nigger
was
frightened
by
something
on
deck
and
jumped
into
the
sea
which
was
running
fairly
rough
however
the
ship
was
hove
to
a
boat
lowered
and
nigger
was
rescued
he
spent
another
happy
year
on
board
but
disappeared
one
dark
night
when
the
ship
was
returning
from
her
second
journey
to
the
south
in
during
a
big
gale
he
often
went
aloft
with
the
men
of
his
own
accord
this
night
he
was
seen
on
the
main
lower
topsail
yard
higher
than
which
he
never
would
go
he
disappeared
in
a
big
squall
probably
because
the
yard
was
covered
with
ice
wilson
rejoined
the
ship
at
melbourne
and
scott
left
her
to
arrange
further
business
matters
and
to
rejoin
in
new
zealand
when
he
landed
i
think
he
had
seen
enough
of
the
personnel
of
the
expedition
to
be
able
to
pass
a
fair
judgment
upon
them
i
can
not
but
think
that
he
was
pleased
such
enthusiasm
and
comradeship
as
prevailed
on
board
could
bear
only
good
fruit
it
would
certainly
have
been
possible
to
find
a
body
of
men
who
could
work
a
sailing
ship
with
greater
skill
but
not
men
who
were
more
willing
and
that
in
the
midst
of
considerable
discomfort
to
work
hard
at
distasteful
jobs
and
be
always
cheerful
and
it
must
have
been
clear
that
with
all
the
energy
which
was
being
freely
expended
the
expedition
came
first
and
the
individual
nowhere
it
is
to
the
honour
of
all
concerned
that
from
the
time
it
left
london
to
the
time
it
returned
to
new
zealand
after
three
years
this
spirit
always
prevailed
among
the
executive
officers
scott
was
putting
more
and
more
trust
in
campbell
who
was
to
lead
the
northern
party
he
was
showing
those
characteristics
which
enabled
him
to
bring
his
small
party
safely
through
one
of
the
hardest
winters
that
men
have
ever
survived
bowers
also
had
shown
seamanlike
qualities
which
are
an
excellent
test
by
which
to
judge
the
antarctic
traveller
a
good
seaman
in
sail
will
probably
make
a
useful
sledger
but
at
this
time
scott
can
hardly
have
foreseen
that
bowers
was
to
prove
the
hardest
traveller
that
ever
undertook
a
polar
journey
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
undaunted
but
he
had
already
proved
himself
a
sailor
among
the
junior
scientific
staff
too
several
were
showing
qualities
as
seamen
which
were
a
good
sign
for
the
future
altogether
i
think
it
must
have
been
with
a
cheerful
mind
that
scott
landed
in
australia
when
we
left
melbourne
for
new
zealand
we
were
all
a
bit
stale
which
was
not
altogether
surprising
and
a
run
ashore
was
to
do
us
a
world
of
good
after
five
months
of
solid
grind
crowded
up
in
a
ship
which
thought
nothing
of
rolling
each
way
also
though
everything
had
been
done
that
could
be
done
to
provide
them
the
want
of
fresh
meat
and
vegetables
was
being
felt
and
it
was
an
excellent
thing
that
a
body
of
men
for
whom
every
precaution
against
scurvy
that
modern
science
could
suggest
was
being
taken
should
have
a
good
course
of
antiscorbutic
food
and
an
equally
beneficial
change
of
life
before
leaving
civilization
and
so
it
was
with
some
anticipation
that
on
monday
morning
october
we
could
smell
the
land
new
zealand
that
home
of
so
many
antarctic
expeditions
where
we
knew
that
we
should
be
welcomed
scott
discovery
shackleton
nimrod
and
now
again
scott
terra
nova
have
all
in
turn
been
berthed
at
the
same
quay
in
lyttelton
for
aught
i
know
at
the
same
no
shed
into
which
they
have
spilled
out
their
holds
and
from
which
they
have
been
restowed
with
the
addition
of
all
that
new
zealand
scorning
payment
could
give
and
from
there
they
have
sailed
and
thither
their
relief
ships
have
returned
year
after
year
scott
words
of
the
discovery
apply
just
as
much
to
the
terra
nova
not
only
did
new
zealand
do
all
in
her
power
to
help
the
expedition
in
an
official
capacity
but
the
new
zealanders
welcomed
both
officers
and
men
with
open
arms
and
gave
them
to
understand
that
although
already
separated
by
many
thousands
of
miles
from
their
native
land
here
in
this
new
land
they
would
find
a
second
home
and
those
who
would
equally
think
of
them
in
their
absence
and
welcome
them
on
their
return
but
we
had
to
sail
round
the
southern
coast
of
new
zealand
and
northwards
up
the
eastern
coast
before
we
could
arrive
at
our
last
port
of
call
the
wind
went
ahead
and
it
was
not
until
the
morning
of
october
that
we
sailed
through
lyttelton
heads
the
word
had
gone
forth
that
we
should
sail
away
on
november
and
there
was
much
to
be
done
in
the
brief
month
that
lay
ahead
there
followed
four
weeks
of
strenuous
work
into
which
was
sandwiched
a
considerable
amount
of
play
the
ship
was
unloaded
when
as
usual
men
and
officers
acted
alike
as
stevedores
and
she
was
docked
that
an
examination
for
the
source
of
the
leak
might
be
made
by
miller
of
lyttelton
who
has
performed
a
like
service
for
more
than
one
antarctic
ship
but
the
different
layers
of
sheathing
protecting
a
ship
which
is
destined
to
fight
against
ice
are
so
complicated
that
it
is
a
very
difficult
matter
to
find
the
origin
of
a
leak
all
that
can
be
said
with
any
certainty
is
that
the
point
where
the
water
appears
inside
the
skin
of
the
ship
is
almost
certainly
not
the
locality
in
which
it
has
penetrated
the
outside
sheathing
our
good
friend
miller
wrote
scott
attacked
the
leak
and
traced
it
to
the
stern
we
found
the
false
stern
split
and
in
one
case
a
hole
bored
for
a
which
was
much
too
large
for
the
bolt
the
ship
still
leaks
but
the
water
can
now
be
kept
under
with
the
hand
pump
by
two
daily
efforts
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
twenty
minutes
this
in
lyttelton
but
in
a
not
far
distant
future
every
pump
was
choked
and
we
were
baling
with
three
buckets
literally
for
our
lives
bowers
feat
of
sorting
and
restowing
not
only
the
stores
we
had
but
the
cheese
butter
tinned
foods
bacon
hams
and
numerous
other
products
which
are
grown
in
new
zealand
and
which
any
expedition
leaving
that
country
should
always
buy
there
in
preference
to
carrying
them
through
the
tropics
was
a
masterstroke
of
and
organization
these
stores
were
all
relisted
before
stowing
and
the
or
northern
party
and
or
main
party
stores
were
not
only
easily
distinguishable
but
also
stowed
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
forthcoming
without
difficulty
at
the
right
time
and
in
their
due
order
the
two
huts
which
were
to
form
the
homes
of
our
two
parties
down
south
had
been
brought
out
in
the
ship
and
were
now
erected
on
a
piece
of
waste
ground
near
by
the
same
men
who
would
be
given
the
work
to
do
in
the
south
the
gear
peculiar
to
the
various
kinds
of
scientific
work
which
it
was
the
object
of
the
expedition
to
carry
out
was
also
stowed
with
great
care
the
more
bulky
objects
included
a
petrol
engine
and
small
dynamo
a
very
delicate
instrument
for
making
pendulum
observations
to
test
the
gravity
of
the
earth
meteorological
screens
and
a
dines
anemometer
there
was
also
a
special
hut
for
magnetic
observations
of
which
only
the
framework
was
finally
taken
with
the
necessary
but
bulky
magnetic
instruments
the
biological
and
photographic
gear
was
also
of
considerable
size
for
the
interior
of
the
huts
there
were
beds
with
spring
mattresses
a
real
luxury
but
one
well
worth
the
space
and
money
tables
chairs
cooking
ranges
and
piping
and
a
complete
acetylene
gas
plant
for
both
parties
there
were
also
extensive
ventilators
which
were
not
a
great
success
the
problem
of
ventilation
in
polar
regions
still
remains
to
be
solved
food
can
be
packed
into
a
comparatively
small
space
but
not
so
fuel
and
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
which
confront
the
polar
traveller
it
must
be
conceded
that
in
this
respect
norway
with
her
wonderful
fram
is
far
ahead
of
us
the
terra
nova
depended
on
coal
and
the
length
of
the
ship
stay
in
the
south
and
the
amount
of
exploration
she
could
do
after
landing
the
shore
parties
depended
almost
entirely
upon
how
much
coal
she
could
be
persuaded
to
hold
after
all
the
necessaries
of
modern
scientific
exploration
had
been
wedged
tightly
into
her
the
terra
nova
sailed
from
new
zealand
with
tons
of
coal
in
her
holds
and
bunkers
and
tons
on
deck
in
sacks
we
were
to
hear
more
of
those
sacks
meanwhile
stalls
were
being
built
under
the
forecastle
for
fifteen
ponies
and
since
room
could
not
be
found
below
for
the
remaining
four
stalls
were
built
on
the
port
side
of
the
fore
hatch
the
decks
were
caulked
and
deck
houses
and
other
fittings
which
might
carry
away
in
the
stormy
seas
of
the
south
were
further
secured
as
the
time
of
departure
drew
near
and
each
day
of
civilization
appeared
to
be
more
and
more
desirable
the
scene
in
lyttelton
became
animated
and
congested
here
is
a
scientist
trying
to
force
just
one
more
case
into
his
small
laboratory
or
decanting
a
mass
of
clothing
just
issued
into
the
bottom
of
his
bunk
to
be
slept
on
since
there
was
no
room
for
it
on
the
deck
of
his
cabin
on
the
main
deck
bowers
is
trying
to
get
one
more
frozen
sheep
into
the
in
the
rigging
working
parties
are
overhauling
the
running
gear
the
staff
are
busy
on
the
engine
and
though
the
ship
is
crowded
there
is
order
everywhere
and
it
is
clean
but
the
scene
on
the
morning
of
saturday
november
baffles
description
there
is
no
deck
visible
in
addition
to
tons
of
coal
in
sacks
on
deck
there
are
tons
of
petrol
stowed
in
drums
which
in
turn
are
cased
in
wood
on
the
top
of
sacks
and
cases
and
on
the
roof
of
the
are
dogs
chained
far
enough
apart
to
keep
them
from
following
their
first
instinct
to
fight
the
nearest
animal
they
can
see
the
ship
is
a
hubbub
of
howls
in
the
forecastle
and
in
the
four
stalls
on
deck
are
the
nineteen
ponies
wedged
tightly
in
their
wooden
stalls
and
dwarfing
everything
are
the
three
motor
sledges
in
their
huge
crates
x
x
two
of
them
on
either
side
of
the
main
hatch
the
third
across
the
break
of
the
poop
they
are
covered
with
tarpaulins
and
secured
in
every
possible
way
but
it
is
clear
that
in
a
big
sea
their
weight
will
throw
a
great
strain
upon
the
deck
it
is
not
altogether
a
cheerful
sight
but
all
that
care
and
skill
can
do
has
been
done
to
ensure
that
the
deck
cargo
will
not
shift
and
that
the
animals
may
be
as
sheltered
as
possible
from
wind
and
seas
and
it
no
good
worrying
about
what
ca
be
helped

when
we

from

wharf
at
lyttelton
at
we
were
to
call
at
dunedin
before
leaving

and
arrived
there
on
sunday

here
we
took
on
the
remainder
of
our

on
monday
night
we
danced
in
fantastic
clothing
for
we
had
left
our
grand
clothes
behind
and
sailed
finally
for
the
south
the
following
afternoon
amidst
the
greatest
enthusiasm
the
wives
remained
with
us
until
we
reached
the
open

amongst
those
who
only
left
us
at
the
last
minute
was
kinsey
of
christchurch
he
acted
for
scott

during
the

days
and
for
shackleton
in
we
all
owe
him
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
for
his
help
his
interest
in
the
expedition
is
wonderful
and
such
interest
on
the
part
of
a
thoroughly
shrewd
business
man
is
an
asset
of
which
i
have
taken
full
advantage
kinsey
will
act
as
my
agent
in
christchurch
during
my
absence
i
have
given
him
an
ordinary
power
of
attorney
and
i
think
have
left
him
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
his
kindness
to
us
was
beyond
words
loom
of
land
and
cape
saunders
light
blinking
the
ponies
and
dogs
were
the
first
consideration
even
in
quite
ordinary
weather
the
dogs
had
a
wretched
time
the
seas
continually
break
on
the
weather
bulwarks
and
scatter
clouds
of
heavy
spray
over
the
backs
of
all
who
must
venture
into
the
waist
of
the
ship
the
dogs
sit
with
their
tails
to
this
invading
water
their
coats
wet
and
dripping
it
is
a
pathetic
attitude
deeply
significant
of
cold
and
misery
occasionally
some
poor
beast
emits
a
long
pathetic
whine
the
group
forms
a
picture
of
wretched
dejection
such
a
life
is
truly
hard
for
these
poor
creatures
the
ponies
were
better
off
four
of
them
were
on
deck
amidships
and
they
were
well
boarded
round
it
is
significant
that
these
ponies
had
a
much
easier
time
in
rough
weather
than
those
in
the
bows
of
the
ship
under
the
forecastle
fifteen
ponies
close
side
by
side
seven
one
side
eight
the
other
heads
together
and
groom
between
swaying
swaying
continually
to
the
plunging
irregular
motion
one
takes
a
look
through
a
hole
in
the
bulkhead
and
sees
a
row
of
heads
with
sad
patient
eyes
come
swinging
up
together
from
the
starboard
side
whilst
those
on
the
port
swing
back
then
up
come
the
port
heads
while
the
starboard
recede
it
seems
a
terrible
ordeal
for
these
poor
beasts
to
stand
this
day
after
day
for
weeks
together
and
indeed
though
they
continue
to
feed
well
the
strain
quickly
drags
down
their
weight
and
condition
but
nevertheless
the
trial
can
not
be
gauged
from
human
standards
the
seas
through
which
we
had
to
pass
to
reach
the
must
be
the
most
stormy
in
the
world
dante
tells
us
that
those
who
have
committed
carnal
sin
are
tossed
about
ceaselessly
by
the
most
furious
winds
in
the
second
circle
of
hell
the
corresponding
hell
on
earth
is
found
in
the
southern
oceans
which
encircle
the
world
without
break
by
the
gales
which
follow
one
another
round
and
round
the
world
from
west
to
east
you
will
find
albatross
there
great
wanderers
and
sooties
and
mollymawks
sailing
as
lightly
before
these
furious
winds
as
ever
do
paolo
and
francesca
round
the
world
they
go
i
doubt
whether
they
land
more
than
once
a
year
and
then
they
come
to
the
islands
of
these
seas
to
breed
there
are
many
other
beautiful
but
most
beautiful
of
all
are
the
snowy
petrels
which
approach
nearer
to
the
fairies
than
anything
else
on
earth
they
are
quite
white
and
seemingly
transparent
they
are
the
familiar
spirits
of
the
pack
which
except
to
nest
they
seldom
if
ever
leave
flying
here
and
there
independently
in
a
mazy
fashion
glittering
against
the
blue
sky
like
so
many
white
moths
or
shining
snowflakes
and
then
there
are
the
giant
petrels
whose
coloration
is
a
puzzle
some
are
nearly
white
others
brown
and
they
exhibit
every
variation
between
the
one
and
the
other
and
on
the
whole
the
white
forms
become
more
general
the
farther
south
you
go
but
the
usual
theory
of
protective
coloration
will
not
fit
in
for
there
are
no
enemies
against
which
this
bird
must
protect
itself
is
it
something
to
do
with
radiation
of
heat
from
the
body
a
ship
which
sets
out
upon
this
journey
generally
has
a
bad
time
and
for
this
reason
the
overladen
state
of
the
terra
nova
was
a
cause
of
anxiety
the
australasian
meteorologists
had
done
their
best
to
forecast
the
weather
we
must
expect
everything
which
was
not
absolutely
necessary
had
been
ruthlessly
scrapped
yet
there
was
not
a
square
inch
of
the
hold
and
which
was
not
crammed
almost
to
bursting
and
there
was
as
much
on
the
deck
as
could
be
expected
to
stay
there
officers
and
men
could
hardly
move
in
their
living
quarters
when
standing
up
and
certainly
they
could
not
all
sit
down
to
say
that
we
were
heavy
laden
is
a
very
moderate
statement
of
the
facts
thursday
december
we
ran
into
a
gale
we
shortened
sail
in
the
afternoon
to
lower
topsails
jib
and
both
wind
and
sea
rose
with
great
rapidity
and
before
the
night
came
our
deck
cargo
had
begun
to
work
loose
you
know
how
carefully
everything
had
been
lashed
but
no
lashings
could
have
withstood
the
onslaught
of
these
coal
sacks
for
long
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
grapple
with
the
evil
and
nearly
all
hands
were
labouring
for
hours
in
the
waist
of
the
ship
heaving
coal
sacks
overboard
and
the
petrol
cases
in
the
best
manner
possible
under
such
difficult
and
dangerous
circumstances
the
seas
were
continually
breaking
over
these
people
and
now
and
again
they
would
be
completely
submerged
at
such
times
they
had
to
cling
for
dear
life
to
some
fixture
to
prevent
themselves
being
washed
overboard
and
with
coal
bags
and
loose
cases
washing
about
there
was
every
risk
of
such
hold
being
torn
away
no
sooner
was
some
semblance
of
order
restored
than
some
exceptionally
heavy
wave
would
tear
away
the
lashing
and
the
work
had
to
be
done
all
over
again
the
conditions
became
much
worse
during
the
night
and
things
were
complicated
for
some
of
us
by
i
have
lively
recollections
of
being
aloft
for
two
hours
in
the
morning
watch
on
friday
and
being
sick
at
intervals
all
the
time
for
sheer
downright
misery
give
me
a
hurricane
not
too
warm
the
yard
of
a
sailing
ship
a
wet
sail
and
a
bout
of
it
must
have
been
about
this
time
that
orders
were
given
to
clew
up
the
jib
and
then
to
furl
it
bowers
and
four
others
went
out
on
the
bowsprit
being
buried
deep
in
the
enormous
seas
every
time
the
ship
plunged
her
nose
into
them
with
great
force
it
was
an
education
to
see
him
lead
those
men
out
into
that
roaring
inferno
he
has
left
his
own
vivid
impression
of
this
gale
in
a
letter
home
his
tendency
was
always
to
underestimate
difficulties
whether
the
force
of
wind
in
a
blizzard
or
the
troubles
of
a
polar
traveller
this
should
be
remembered
when
reading
the
vivid
accounts
which
his
mother
has
so
kindly
given
me
permission
to
use
we
got
through
the
forties
with
splendid
speed
and
were
just
over
the
fifties
when
one
of
those
tremendous
gales
got
us
our
lat
was
about
a
part
of
the
world
absolutely
unfrequented
by
shipping
of
any
sort
and
as
we
had
already
been
blown
off
campbell
island
we
had
nothing
but
a
clear
sweep
to
cape
horn
to
leeward
one
realized
then
how
in
the
nimrod
in
spite
of
the
weather
they
always
had
the
security
of
a
big
steamer
to
look
to
if
things
came
to
the
worst
we
were
indeed
alone
by
many
hundreds
of
miles
and
never
having
felt
anxious
about
a
ship
before
the
old
whaler
was
to
give
me
a
new
experience
in
the
afternoon
of
the
beginning
of
the
gale
i
helped
make
fast
the
sails
upper
topsails
and
foresail
and
was
horrified
on
arrival
on
deck
to
find
that
the
heavy
water
we
continued
to
ship
was
starting
the
coal
bags
floating
in
places
these
acting
as
tore
adrift
some
of
my
carefully
stowed
petrol
cases
and
endangered
the
lot
i
had
started
to
make
sail
fast
at
and
it
was
when
i
had
finished
putting
on
additional
lashings
to
everything
i
could
so
rapidly
did
the
sea
get
up
that
one
was
continually
afloat
and
swimming
about
i
turned
in
for
hours
and
lay
awake
hearing
the
crash
of
the
seas
and
thinking
how
long
those
cases
would
stand
it
till
my
watch
came
at
midnight
as
a
relief
we
were
under
lower
topsails
and
hove
to
the
engines
going
dead
slow
to
assist
keeping
head
to
wind
at
another
time
i
should
have
been
easy
in
my
mind
now
the
water
that
came
aboard
was
simply
fearful
and
the
wrenching
on
the
old
ship
was
enough
to
worry
any
sailor
called
upon
to
fill
his
decks
with
garbage
fore
and
aft
still
nothing
and
do
nothing
if
funds
could
not
supply
another
ship
we
simply
had
to
overload
the
one
we
had
or
suffer
worse
things
down
south
the
watch
was
eventful
as
the
shaking
up
got
the
fine
coal
into
the
bilges
and
this
mixing
with
the
oil
from
the
engines
formed
balls
of
coal
and
grease
which
ordinarily
went
up
the
pumps
easily
now
however
with
the
great
strains
and
hundreds
of
tons
on
deck
as
she
continually
filled
the
water
started
to
come
in
too
fast
for
the
pumps
to
cope
with
an
alternative
was
offered
to
me
in
going
faster
so
as
to
shake
up
the
big
pump
on
the
main
engines
and
this
i
did
in
spite
of
myself
and
in
defiance
of
the
first
principles
of
seamanship
of
course
we
shipped
water
more
and
more
and
only
to
save
a
clean
breach
of
the
decks
did
i
slow
down
again
and
let
the
water
gain
my
next
card
was
to
get
the
watch
on
the
as
well
and
these
were
choked
too
or
nearly
so
anyhow
with
every
pump
hand
and
steam
going
the
water
continued
to
rise
in
the
stokehold
at
all
hands
took
in
the
fore
lower
topsail
leaving
us
under
a
minimum
of
sail
the
gale
increased
to
storm
force
force
out
of
and
such
a
sea
got
up
as
only
the
southern
fifties
can
produce
all
the
afterguard
turned
out
and
the
pumps
were
vigorously
shaken
up
sickening
work
as
only
a
dribble
came
out
we
had
to
throw
some
coal
overboard
to
clear
the
after
deck
round
the
pumps
and
i
set
to
work
to
rescue
cases
of
petrol
which
were
smashed
adrift
i
broke
away
a
plank
or
two
of
the
lee
bulwarks
to
give
the
seas
some
outlet
as
they
were
right
over
the
level
of
the
rail
and
one
was
constantly
on
the
verge
of
floating
clean
over
the
side
with
the
cataract
force
of
the
backwash
i
had
all
the
swimming
i
wanted
that
day
every
case
i
rescued
was
put
on
the
weather
side
of
the
poop
to
help
get
us
on
a
more
even
keel
she
sagged
horribly
and
the
unfortunate
ponies
though
under
cover
were
so
jerked
about
that
the
weather
ones
could
not
keep
their
feet
in
their
stalls
so
great
was
the
slope
and
strain
on
their
forelegs
oates
and
atkinson
worked
among
them
like
trojans
but
morning
saw
the
death
of
one
and
the
loss
of
one
dog
overboard
the
dogs
made
fast
on
deck
were
washed
to
and
fro
chained
by
the
neck
and
often
submerged
for
a
considerable
time
though
we
did
everything
in
our
power
to
get
them
up
as
high
as
possible
the
sea
went
everywhere
the
wardroom
was
a
swamp
and
so
were
our
bunks
with
all
our
nice
clothing
books
etc
however
of
this
we
cared
little
when
the
water
had
crept
up
to
the
furnaces
and
put
the
fires
out
and
we
realized
for
the
first
time
that
the
ship
had
met
her
match
and
was
slowly
filling
without
a
pump
to
suck
we
started
the
forlorn
hope
of
buckets
and
began
to
bale
her
out
had
we
been
able
to
open
a
hatch
we
could
have
cleared
the
main
pump
well
at
once
but
with
those
appalling
seas
literally
covering
her
it
would
have
meant
less
than
minutes
to
float
had
we
uncovered
a
hatch
the
chief
engineer
williams
and
carpenter
davies
after
we
had
all
put
our
heads
together
started
cutting
a
hole
in
the
engine
room
bulkhead
to
enable
us
to
get
into
the
from
the
engine
room
it
was
iron
and
therefore
at
least
a
hours
job
captain
scott
was
simply
splendid
he
might
have
been
at
cowes
and
to
do
him
and
teddy
evans
credit
at
our
worst
strait
none
of
our
landsmen
who
were
working
so
hard
knew
how
serious
things
were
capt
scott
said
to
me
quietly
am
afraid
it
a
bad
business
for
us
what
do
you
think
i
said
we
were
by
no
means
dead
yet
though
at
that
moment
oates
at
peril
of
his
life
got
aft
to
report
another
horse
dead
and
more
down
and
then
an
awful
sea
swept
away
our
lee
bulwarks
clean
between
the
fore
and
main
riggings
only
our
chain
lashings
saved
the
lee
motor
sledge
then
and
i
was
soon
diving
after
petrol
cases
captain
scott
calmly
told
me
that
they
not
matter
this
was
our
great
project
for
getting
to
the
pole
the
much
advertised
motors
that
not
matter
our
dogs
looked
finished
and
horses
were
finishing
and
i
went
to
bale
with
a
strenuous
prayer
in
my
heart
and
on
my
lips
and
so
we
pulled
through
that
day
we
sang
and
every
silly
song
we
ever
knew
and
then
everybody
in
the
ship
later
on
was
put
on
reliefs
to
bale
as
it
was
impossible
for
flesh
to
keep
heart
with
no
food
or
rest
even
the
pump
had
gone
wrong
so
we
drank
neat
lime
juice
or
anything
that
came
along
and
sat
in
our
saturated
state
awaiting
our
next
spell
my
dressing
gown
was
my
great
comfort
as
it
was
not
very
wet
and
it
is
a
lovely
warm
thing
to
make
a
long
yarn
short
we
found
later
in
the
day
that
the
storm
was
easing
a
bit
and
that
though
there
was
a
terrible
lot
of
water
in
the
ship
which
try
as
we
could
we
could
not
reduce
it
certainly
had
ceased
to
rise
to
any
great
extent
we
had
reason
to
hope
then
that
we
might
keep
her
afloat
till
the
pump
wells
could
be
cleared
had
the
storm
lasted
another
day
god
knows
what
our
state
would
have
been
if
we
had
been
above
water
at
all
you
can
not
imagine
how
utterly
helpless
we
felt
in
such
a
sea
with
a
tiny
ship
the
great
expedition
with
all
its
hopes
thrown
aside
for
its
life
god
had
shown
us
the
weakness
of
man
hand
and
it
was
enough
for
the
best
of
us
the
people
who
had
been
made
such
a
lot
of
lately
the
whole
scene
was
one
of
pathos
really
however
at
evans
and
i
with
the
carpenter
were
able
to
crawl
through
a
tiny
hole
in
the
bulkhead
burrow
over
the
coal
to
the
cofferdam
where
another
hole
having
been
easily
made
in
the
wood
we
got
down
below
with
davy
lamps
and
set
to
work
the
water
was
so
deep
that
you
had
to
continually
dive
to
get
your
hand
on
to
the
suction
after
hours
or
so
it
was
cleared
for
the
time
being
and
the
pumps
worked
merrily
i
went
in
again
at
and
had
another
lap
at
clearing
it
not
till
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
though
did
we
see
the
last
of
the
water
and
the
last
of
the
great
gale
during
the
time
the
pumps
were
working
we
continued
the
baling
till
the
water
got
below
the
furnaces
as
soon
as
we
could
light
up
we
did
and
got
the
other
pumps
under
weigh
and
once
the
ship
was
empty
clearing
away
the
suction
was
a
simple
matter
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
after
all
i
had
only
lost
about
gallons
of
the
petrol
and
bad
as
things
had
been
they
might
have
been
worse
you
will
ask
where
all
the
water
came
from
seeing
our
forward
leak
had
been
stopped
thank
god
we
did
not
have
that
to
cope
with
as
well
the
water
came
chiefly
through
the
deck
where
the
tremendous
strain
not
only
of
the
deck
load
but
of
the
smashing
seas
was
beyond
conception
she
was
caught
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage
and
we
were
dependent
for
our
lives
on
each
plank
standing
its
own
strain
had
one
gone
we
would
all
have
gone
and
the
great
anxiety
was
not
so
much
the
existing
water
as
what
was
going
to
open
up
if
the
storm
continued
we
might
have
dumped
the
deck
cargo
a
difficult
job
at
best
but
were
too
busy
baling
to
do
anything
else
that
captain
scott
account
will
be
moderate
you
may
be
sure
still
take
my
word
for
it
he
is
one
of
the
best
and
behaved
up
to
our
best
traditions
at
a
time
when
his
own
outlook
must
have
been
the
blackness
of
darkness
characteristically
bowers
ends
his
account
under
its
worst
conditions
this
earth
is
a
good
place
to
live
in
priestley
wrote
in
his
diary
if
dante
had
seen
our
ship
as
she
was
at
her
worst
i
fancy
he
would
have
got
a
good
idea
for
another
circle
of
hell
though
he
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
account
for
such
a
cheerful
and
ribald
lot
of
souls
the
situation
narrowed
down
to
a
fight
between
the
incoming
water
and
the
men
who
were
trying
to
keep
it
in
check
by
baling
her
out
the
terra
nova
will
never
be
more
full
of
water
nearly
up
to
the
furnaces
than
she
was
that
friday
morning
when
we
were
told
to
go
and
do
our
damndest
with
three
iron
buckets
the
constructors
had
not
allowed
for
baling
only
for
the
passage
of
one
man
at
a
time
up
and
down
the
two
iron
ladders
which
connected
the
floor
plates
with
the
deck
if
we
used
more
than
three
buckets
the
business
of
passing
them
rapidly
up
emptying
them
out
of
the
hatchway
and
returning
them
empty
became
unprofitable
we
were
divided
into
two
gangs
and
all
friday
and
friday
night
we
worked
two
hours
on
and
two
hours
off
like
fiends
wilson
journal
describes
the
scene
it
was
a
weird
night
work
with
the
howling
gale
and
the
darkness
and
the
immense
seas
running
over
the
ship
every
few
minutes
and
no
engines
and
no
sail
and
we
all
in
the
oil
and
bilge
water
singing
chanties
as
we
passed
up
slopping
buckets
full
of
bilge
each
man
above
slopping
a
little
over
the
heads
of
all
below
him
wet
through
to
the
skin
so
much
so
that
some
of
the
party
worked
altogether
naked
like
chinese
coolies
and
the
rush
of
the
wave
backwards
and
forwards
at
the
bottom
grew
hourly
less
in
the
dim
light
of
a
couple
of
oil
lamps
whose
light
just
made
the
darkness
visible
the
ship
all
the
time
rolling
like
a
sodden
lifeless
log
her
lee
gunwale
under
water
every
time
there
was
one
thrilling
moment
in
the
midst
of
the
worst
hour
on
friday
when
we
were
realizing
that
the
fires
must
be
drawn
and
when
every
pump
had
failed
to
act
and
when
the
bulwarks
began
to
go
to
pieces
and
the
petrol
cases
were
all
afloat
and
going
overboard
and
the
word
was
suddenly
passed
in
a
shout
from
the
hands
at
work
in
the
waist
of
the
ship
trying
to
save
petrol
cases
that
smoke
was
coming
up
through
the
seams
in
the
afterhold
as
this
was
full
of
coal
and
patent
fuel
and
was
next
the
and
as
it
had
not
been
opened
for
the
airing
it
required
to
get
rid
of
gas
on
account
of
the
flood
of
water
on
deck
making
it
impossible
to
open
the
hatchway
the
possibility
of
a
fire
there
was
patent
to
every
one
and
it
could
not
possibly
have
been
dealt
with
in
any
way
short
of
opening
the
hatches
and
flooding
the
ship
when
she
must
have
foundered
it
was
therefore
a
thrilling
moment
or
two
until
it
was
discovered
that
the
smoke
was
really
steam
arising
from
the
bilge
at
the
bottom
having
risen
to
the
heated
coal
meanwhile
men
were
working
for
all
our
lives
to
cut
through
two
bulkheads
which
cut
off
all
communication
with
the
suction
of
the
one
bulkhead
was
iron
the
other
wood
scott
wrote
at
this
time
we
are
not
out
of
the
wood
but
hope
dawns
as
indeed
it
should
for
me
when
i
find
myself
so
wonderfully
served
officers
and
men
are
singing
chanties
over
their
arduous
work
williams
is
working
in
sweltering
heat

not
a
single
one
has
lost
his
good
spirits
a
dog
was
drowned
last
night
one
pony
is
dead
and
two
others
in
a
bad
condition
probably
they
too
will
go
occasionally
a
heavy
sea
would
bear
one
of
them
away
and
he
was
only
saved
by
his
chain
meares
with
some
helpers
had
constantly
to
be
rescuing
these
wretched
creatures
from
hanging
and
trying
to
find
them
better
shelter
an
almost
hopeless
task
one
poor
beast
was
found
hanging
when
dead
one
was
washed
away
with
such
force
that
his
chain
broke
and
he
disappeared
overboard
the
next
wave
miraculously
washed
him
on
board
again
and
he
is
fit
and
well
i
believe
the
dog
was
osman
the
gale
has
exacted
heavy
toll
but
i
feel
all
will
be
well
if
we
can
only
cope
with
the
water
another
dog
has
just
been
washed
overboard
alas
thank
god
the
gale
is
abating
the
sea
is
still
mountainously
high
but
the
ship
is
not
labouring
so
heavily
as
she
was
the
highest
waves
of
which
i
can
find
any
record
were
feet
high
these
were
observed
by
sir
james
ross
in
the
north
atlantic
on
december
the
waves
were
logged
probably
by
pennell
who
was
extremely
careful
in
his
measurements
as
being
feet
high
estimated
at
one
time
i
saw
scott
standing
on
the
weather
rail
of
the
poop
buried
to
his
waist
in
green
sea
the
reader
can
then
imagine
the
condition
of
things
in
the
waist
of
the
ship
over
and
over
again
the
rail
from
the
to
the
main
was
covered
by
a
solid
sheet
of
curling
water
which
swept
aft
and
high
on
the
poop
at
another
time
bowers
and
campbell
were
standing
upon
the
bridge
and
the
ship
rolled
sluggishly
over
until
the
lee
combings
of
the
main
hatch
were
under
the
sea
they
watched
anxiously
and
slowly
she
righted
herself
but
she
wo
do
that
often
said
bowers
as
a
rule
if
a
ship
gets
that
far
over
she
goes
down
our
journey
was
uneventful
for
a
time
but
of
course
it
was
not
by
any
means
smooth
i
was
much
disturbed
last
night
by
the
motion
the
ship
was
pitching
and
twisting
with
short
sharp
movements
on
a
confused
sea
and
with
every
plunge
my
thoughts
flew
to
our
poor
ponies
this
afternoon
they
are
fairly
well
but
one
knows
that
they
must
be
getting
weaker
as
time
goes
on
and
one
longs
to
give
them
a
good
sound
rest
with
a
ship
on
an
even
keel
poor
patient
beasts
one
wonders
how
far
the
memory
of
such
fearful
discomfort
will
remain
with
them
animals
so
often
remember
places
and
conditions
where
they
have
encountered
difficulties
or
hurt
do
they
only
recollect
circumstances
which
are
deeply
impressed
by
some
shock
of
fear
or
sudden
pain
and
does
the
remembrance
of
prolonged
strain
pass
away
who
can
tell
but
it
would
seem
strangely
merciful
if
nature
should
blot
out
these
weeks
of
slow
but
inevitable
torture
on
december
noon
position
one
berg
was
sighted
far
away
to
the
west
as
it
gleamed
every
now
and
then
in
the
sun
two
more
were
seen
the
next
day
and
at
on
december
noon
position
the
pack
was
sighted
ahead
by
rennick
all
that
day
we
passed
bergs
and
streams
of
ice
the
air
became
dry
and
bracing
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
sun
shining
on
the
islands
of
ice
was
more
than
beautiful
and
then
bump
we
had
just
charged
the
first
big
floe
and
we
were
in
the
pack
the
sky
has
been
wonderful
with
every
form
of
cloud
in
every
condition
of
light
and
shade
the
sun
has
continually
appeared
through
breaks
in
the
cloudy
heavens
from
time
to
time
brilliantly
illuminating
some
field
of
pack
some
berg
or
some
patch
of
bluest
sea
so
sunlight
and
shadow
have
chased
each
other
across
our
scene
there
is
little
or
no
swell
the
ship
is
on
an
even
keel
steady
save
for
the
occasional
shocks
on
striking
ice
it
is
difficult
to
express
the
sense
of
relief
this
steadiness
gives
after
our
passage
one
can
only
imagine
the
relief
and
comfort
afforded
to
the
ponies
but
the
dogs
are
visibly
cheered
and
the
human
element
is
full
of
gaiety
the
voyage
seems
full
of
promise
in
spite
of
the
imminence
of
delay
we
had
met
the
pack
farther
north
than
any
other
ship
what
is
pack
speaking
very
generally
indeed
in
this
region
it
is
the
which
forms
over
the
ross
sea
area
during
the
winter
and
is
blown
northwards
by
the
southerly
blizzards
but
as
we
shall
see
the
ice
which
forms
over
this
area
is
of
infinite
variety
as
a
rule
great
sheets
spread
over
the
seas
which
fringe
the
antarctic
continent
in
the
autumn
grow
thicker
and
thicker
during
the
winter
and
spring
and
break
up
when
the
temperatures
of
sea
and
air
rise
in
summer
such
is
the
ice
which
forms
in
normal
seasons
round
the
shores
of
mcmurdo
sound
and
up
the
coast
of
the
western
mountains
of
victoria
land
in
sheltered
bays
this
ice
will
sometimes
remain
in
for
two
years
or
even
more
growing
all
the
time
until
some
phenomenal
releases
it
we
found
an
example
of
this
in
the
which
formed
between
hut
point
and
the
barrier
but
there
are
great
waters
which
can
never
freeze
for
very
long
cape
crozier
for
instance
where
the
emperor
penguins
nest
in
winter
is
one
of
the
windiest
places
in
the
world
in
july
it
was
completely
frozen
over
as
far
as
we
could
see
in
the
darkness
from
a
height
of
feet
within
a
few
days
a
hurricane
had
blown
it
all
away
and
the
sea
was
black
i
believe
and
we
had
experiences
to
prove
me
right
that
there
is
a
critical
period
early
in
the
winter
and
that
if
has
not
frozen
thick
enough
to
remain
fast
by
that
time
it
is
probable
that
the
sea
will
remain
open
for
the
rest
of
the
year
but
this
does
not
mean
that
no
ice
will
form
so
great
is
the
wish
of
the
sea
to
freeze
and
so
cold
is
the
air
that
the
wind
has
only
to
lull
for
one
instant
and
the
surface
is
covered
with
a
thin
film
of
ice
as
though
by
magic
but
the
next
blizzard
tears
it
out
by
force
or
a
spring
tide
coaxes
it
out
by
stealth
whether
it
be
a
foot
thick
or
only
a
fraction
of
an
inch
such
an
example
we
had
at
our
very
doors
during
our
last
winter
and
the
untamed
winds
which
blew
as
a
result
were
atrocious
thus
it
is
that
floes
from
a
few
inches
to
twenty
feet
thick
go
voyaging
out
to
join
the
belt
of
ice
which
is
known
as
the
pack
scott
seems
to
have
thought
that
the
whole
ross
sea
freezes
over
i
myself
think
this
doubtful
and
i
am
i
believe
the
only
person
living
who
has
seen
the
ross
sea
open
in
this
was
on
the
winter
journey
undertaken
by
wilson
bowers
and
myself
in
pursuit
of
emperor
penguin
eggs
but
of
that
later
it
is
clear
that
winds
and
currents
are
broadly
speaking
the
governing
factors
of
the
density
of
by
experience
we
know
that
clear
water
may
be
found
in
the
autumn
where
great
tracts
of
ice
barred
the
way
in
summer
the
tendency
of
the
pack
is
northwards
where
the
ice
melts
into
the
warmer
waters
but
the
bergs
remain
when
all
traces
of
the
pack
have
disappeared
and
drifting
northwards
still
form
the
menace
to
shipping
so
well
known
to
sailors
rounding
the
horn
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
that
one
monster
ice
island
of
twenty
miles
in
length
such
as
do
haunt
these
seas
drifting
into
navigated
waters
and
calving
into
hundreds
of
great
bergs
as
it
goes
will
in
itself
produce
what
seamen
call
a
bad
year
for
ice
and
the
last
stages
of
these
when
the
bergs
have
degenerated
into
are
even
worse
for
then
the
sharpest
eye
can
hardly
distinguish
them
as
they
float
nearly
submerged
though
they
have
lost
but
little
of
their
powers
of
evil
there
are
two
main
types
of
antarctic
berg
the
first
and
most
common
is
the
tabular
form
bergs
of
this
shape
cruise
about
in
thousands
and
thousands
a
less
common
form
is
known
as
the
pinnacled
berg
and
in
almost
every
case
this
is
a
tabular
berg
which
has
been
weathered
or
has
capsized
the
number
of
bergs
which
calve
direct
from
a
mountain
glacier
into
the
sea
is
probably
not
very
great
whence
then
do
they
come
the
origin
of
the
tabular
bergs
was
debated
until
a
few
years
ago
they
have
been
recorded
up
to
forty
and
even
fifty
miles
in
length
and
they
have
been
called
floe
bergs
because
it
was
supposed
that
they
froze
first
as
ordinary
and
increased
by
subsequent
additions
from
below
but
now
we
know
that
these
bergs
calve
off
from
the
antarctic
barriers
the
largest
of
which
is
known
as
the
great
ice
barrier
which
forms
the
southern
boundary
of
the
ross
sea
we
were
to
become
very
familiar
with
this
vast
field
of
ice
we
know
that
its
northern
face
is
afloat
we
guess
that
it
may
all
be
afloat
at
any
rate
the
open
sea
now
washes
against
its
face
at
least
forty
miles
south
of
where
it
ran
in
the
days
of
ross
though
this
barrier
may
be
the
largest
in
the
world
it
is
one
of
many
the
most
modern
review
of
this
mystery
scott
article
on
the
great
ice
barrier
must
serve
until
the
next
examination
by
some
future
explorer
a
berg
shows
only
about
of
its
total
mass
above
water
and
a
berg
two
hundred
feet
high
will
therefore
reach
approximately
fourteen
hundred
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
sea
winds
and
currents
have
far
more
influence
upon
them
than
they
have
upon
the
pack
through
which
these
bergs
plough
their
way
with
a
total
disregard
for
such
flimsy
obstacles
and
cause
much
chaos
as
they
go
for
the
rest
woe
betide
the
ship
which
is
so
fixed
into
the
pack
that
she
can
not
move
if
one
of
these
monsters
bears
down
upon
her
words
can
not
tell
the
beauty
of
the
scenes
through
which
we
were
to
pass
during
the
next
three
weeks
i
suppose
the
pack
in
winter
must
be
a
terrible
place
enough
a
place
of
darkness
and
desolation
hardly
to
be
found
elsewhere
but
forms
which
under
different
conditions
can
only
betoken
horror
now
conveyed
to
us
impressions
of
the
utmost
peace
and
beauty
for
the
sun
had
kissed
them
all
we
have
had
a
marvellous
day
the
morning
watch
was
cloudy
but
it
gradually
cleared
until
the
sky
was
a
brilliant
blue
fading
on
the
horizon
into
green
and
pink
the
floes
were
pink
floating
in
a
deep
blue
sea
and
all
the
shadows
were
mauve
we
passed
right
under
a
monster
berg
and
all
day
have
been
threading
lake
after
lake
and
lead
after
lead
is
regent
street
said
somebody
and
for
some
time
we
drove
through
great
streets
of
perpendicular
walls
of
ice
many
a
time
they
were
so
straight
that
one
imagined
they
had
been
cut
off
with
a
ruler
some
hundreds
of
yards
in
length
illustration
midnight
wilson
del
on
another
occasion
stayed
on
deck
till
midnight
the
sun
just
dipped
below
the
southern
horizon
the
scene
was
incomparable
the
northern
sky
was
gloriously
rosy
and
reflected
in
the
calm
sea
between
the
ice
which
varied
from
burnished
copper
to
salmon
pink
bergs
and
pack
to
the
north
had
a
pale
greenish
hue
with
deep
purple
shadows
the
sky
shaded
to
saffron
and
pale
green
we
gazed
long
at
these
beautiful
effects
but
this
was
not
always
so
there
was
one
day
with
rain
there
were
days
of
snow
and
hail
and
cold
wet
slush
and
fog
the
position
is
very
cheerless
all
hope
that
this
easterly
wind
will
open
the
pack
seems
to
have
vanished
we
are
surrounded
with
compacted
floes
of
immense
area
openings
appear
between
these
floes
and
we
slide
from
one
to
another
with
long
delays
between
it
is
difficult
to
keep
hope
alive
there
are
streaks
of
water
sky
over
open
leads
to
the
north
but
everywhere
to
the
south
we
have
the
uniform
white
sky
the
day
has
been
overcast
and
the
wind
force
to
from
the
snow
has
fallen
from
time
to
time
there
could
scarcely
be
a
more
dreary
prospect
for
the
eye
to
rest
upon
with
the
open
water
we
left
behind
the
albatross
and
the
cape
pigeon
which
had
accompanied
us
lately
for
many
months
in
their
place
we
found
the
antarctic
petrel
a
richly
piebald
bird
that
appeared
to
be
almost
black
and
white
against
the
ice
floes
and
the
snowy
petrel
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
no
one
of
us
whose
privilege
it
was
to
be
there
will
forget
our
first
sight
of
the
penguins
our
first
meal
of
seal
meat
or
that
first
big
berg
along
which
we
coasted
close
in
order
that
london
might
see
it
on
the
film
hardly
had
we
reached
the
thick
pack
which
prevailed
after
the
suburbs
had
been
passed
when
we
saw
the
little
adélie
penguins
hurrying
to
meet
us
great
scott
they
seemed
to
say
what
this
and
soon
we
could
hear
the
cry
which
we
shall
never
forget
aark
aark
they
said
and
full
of
wonder
and
curiosity
and
perhaps
a
little
out
of
breath
they
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
express
their
feelings
and
to
gaze
and
cry
in
wonder
to
their
companions
now
walking
along
the
edge
of
a
floe
in
search
of
a
narrow
spot
to
jump
and
so
avoid
the
water
and
with
head
down
and
much
hesitation
judging
the
width
of
the
narrow
gap
to
give
a
little
standing
jump
across
as
would
a
child
and
running
on
the
faster
to
make
up
for
its
delay
again
coming
to
a
wider
lead
of
water
necessitating
a
plunge
our
inquisitive
visitor
would
be
lost
for
a
moment
to
reappear
like
a
on
a
nearer
floe
where
wagging
his
tail
he
immediately
resumed
his
race
towards
the
ship
being
now
but
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
us
he
pokes
his
head
constantly
forward
on
this
side
and
on
that
to
try
and
make
out
something
of
the
new
strange
sight
crying
aloud
to
his
friends
in
his
amazement
and
exhibiting
the
most
amusing
indecision
between
his
desire
for
further
investigation
and
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
and
propriety
of
closer
contact
with
so
huge
a
beast
they
are
extraordinarily
like
children
these
little
people
of
the
antarctic
world
either
like
children
or
like
old
men
full
of
their
own
importance
and
late
for
dinner
in
their
black
and
white
and
rather
portly
withal
we
used
to
sing
to
them
as
they
to
us
and
you
might
often
see
a
group
of
explorers
on
the
poop
singing
has
rings
on
her
fingers
and
bells
on
her
toes
and
she
shall
have
music
wherever
she
goes
and
so
on
at
the
top
of
their
voices
to
an
admiring
group
of
adélie
penguins
meares
used
to
sing
to
them
what
he
called
save
and
declared
that
it
would
always
send
them
headlong
into
the
water
he
sang
flat
perhaps
that
was
why
two
or
more
penguins
will
combine
to
push
a
third
in
front
of
them
against
a
skua
gull
which
is
one
of
their
enemies
for
he
eats
their
eggs
or
their
young
if
he
gets
the
chance
they
will
refuse
to
dive
off
an
until
they
have
persuaded
one
of
their
companions
to
take
the
first
jump
for
fear
of
the
which
may
be
waiting
in
the
water
below
ready
to
seize
them
and
play
with
them
much
as
a
cat
will
play
with
a
mouse
as
levick
describes
in
his
book
about
the
penguins
at
cape
adare
at
the
place
where
they
most
often
went
in
a
long
terrace
of
ice
about
six
feet
in
height
ran
for
some
hundreds
of
yards
along
the
edge
of
the
water
and
here
just
as
on
the
crowds
would
stand
near
the
brink
when
they
had
succeeded
in
pushing
one
of
their
number
over
all
would
crane
their
necks
over
the
edge
and
when
they
saw
the
pioneer
safe
in
the
water
the
rest
followed
it
is
clear
then
that
the
adélie
penguin
will
show
a
certain
spirit
of
selfishness
in
tackling
his
hereditary
enemies
but
when
it
comes
to
the
danger
of
which
he
is
ignorant
his
courage
betrays
want
of
caution
meares
and
dimitri
exercised
the
out
upon
the
larger
floes
when
we
were
held
up
for
any
length
of
time
one
day
a
team
was
tethered
by
the
side
of
the
ship
and
a
penguin
sighted
them
and
hurried
from
afar
off
the
dogs
became
frantic
with
excitement
as
he
neared
them
he
supposed
it
was
a
greeting
and
the
louder
they
barked
and
the
more
they
strained
at
their
ropes
the
faster
he
bustled
to
meet
them
he
was
extremely
angry
with
a
man
who
went
and
saved
him
from
a
very
sudden
end
clinging
to
his
trousers
with
his
beak
and
furiously
beating
his
shins
with
his
flippers
it
was
not
an
uncommon
sight
to
see
a
little
adélie
penguin
standing
within
a
few
inches
of
the
nose
of
a
dog
which
was
almost
frantic
with
desire
and
passion
the
is
the
home
of
the
immature
penguins
both
emperor
and
adélie
but
we
did
not
see
any
large
numbers
of
immature
emperors
during
this
voyage
we
soon
became
acquainted
with
the
which
waits
under
the
for
the
little
penguins
he
is
a
brute
but
sinuous
and
graceful
as
the
seal
world
goes
he
preys
especially
upon
the
adélie
penguin
and
levick
found
no
less
than
eighteen
penguins
together
with
the
remains
of
many
others
in
the
stomach
of
one
in
the
water
the
leopard
seems
a
trifle
faster
than
the
adélies
as
one
of
them
occasionally
would
catch
up
with
one
of
the
fugitives
who
then
realizing
that
speed
alone
would
not
avail
him
started
dodging
from
side
to
side
and
sometimes
swam
rapidly
round
and
round
in
a
circle
of
about
twelve
feet
diameter
for
a
full
minute
or
more
doubtless
knowing
that
he
was
quicker
in
turning
than
his
great
heavy
pursuer
but
exhaustion
would
overtake
him
in
the
end
and
we
could
see
the
head
and
jaws
of
the
great
rise
to
the
surface
as
he
grabbed
his
victim
the
sight
of
a
little
adélie
tearing
round
and
round
in
this
manner
was
sadly
common
late
in
the
season
fish
and
small
seal
have
also
been
found
in
its
stomach
with
long
powerful
head
and
neck
and
a
sinuous
body
it
is
equipped
with
most
formidable
teeth
with
which
it
tears
strips
out
of
the
still
living
birds
and
flippers
which
are
adapted
entirely
for
speed
in
the
water
it
is
a
solitary
animal
with
a
large
range
of
distribution
it
has
been
supposed
to
bring
forth
its
young
in
the
pack
but
nothing
definite
is
known
on
this
subject
one
day
we
saw
a
big
swimming
along
with
the
ship
he
dived
under
the
floes
and
reappeared
from
floe
to
floe
as
we
went
and
for
a
time
we
thought
he
was
interested
in
us
but
soon
we
sighted
another
lying
away
on
a
floe
and
our
friend
in
the
water
began
to
rear
his
head
up
perpendicularly
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
wind
his
mate
as
we
supposed
he
was
down
wind
from
her
and
appeared
to
find
her
at
a
distance
of
to
yards
and
the
last
we
saw
of
him
he
was
heading
up
the
side
of
the
floe
where
she
lay
there
are
four
kinds
of
seal
in
the
antarctic
of
one
of
these
the
i
have
already
spoken
another
is
called
the
ross
seal
for
sir
james
ross
discovered
it
in
it
seems
to
be
a
solitary
beast
living
in
the
pack
and
is
peculiar
for
its
expression
of
countenance
it
has
always
been
rare
and
no
single
specimen
was
seen
on
this
expedition
though
the
terra
nova
must
have
passed
through
more
pack
than
most
whalers
see
in
a
it
looks
as
if
the
ross
seal
is
more
rare
than
was
supposed
illustration
a
sea
leopard
illustration
a
weddell
seal
the
very
common
seal
of
the
antarctic
is
the
weddell
which
seldom
lives
in
the
pack
but
spends
its
life
catching
fish
close
to
the
shores
of
the
continent
and
digesting
them
when
caught
lying
sluggishly
upon
the
we
came
to
know
them
later
in
their
hundreds
in
mcmurdo
sound
for
the
weddell
is
a
seal
and
is
only
found
in
large
numbers
near
the
coast
just
at
this
time
it
was
the
seal
which
we
saw
very
fairly
often
generally
several
of
them
together
but
never
in
large
numbers
wilson
has
pointed
out
in
his
article
upon
seals
in
the
discovery
report
that
the
weddell
and
the
seal
which
are
the
two
commoner
of
the
antarctic
seals
have
agreed
to
differ
both
in
habit
and
in
diet
and
therefore
they
share
the
field
successfully
he
shows
that
the
two
penguins
which
share
the
same
area
have
differentiated
in
a
somewhat
similar
manner
the
weddell
seal
and
the
emperor
penguin
have
the
following
points
in
common
namely
a
littoral
distribution
a
fish
diet
and
residential
habit
remaining
as
far
south
the
whole
year
round
as
open
water
will
allow
whereas
the
other
two
the
seal
and
the
adélie
penguin
have
in
common
a
more
pelagic
habit
a
crustacean
diet
and
a
distribution
definitely
migratory
in
the
case
of
the
penguin
and
although
not
so
definitely
migratory
in
the
case
of
the
seal
yet
checked
from
coming
so
far
south
as
weddell
seal
in
winter
by
a
strong
tendency
to
keep
in
touch
with
pelagic
ice
wilson
considers
that
the
advantage
lies
in
each
case
with
the
and
more
southern
species
the
weddell
seal
and
the
emperor
penguin
i
doubt
whether
he
would
confirm
this
now
the
emperor
penguin
weighing
six
stones
and
more
seems
to
me
to
have
a
very
much
harder
fight
for
life
than
the
little
adélie
before
the
discovery
started
from
england
in
an
was
produced
by
the
royal
geographical
society
giving
a
summary
of
the
information
which
existed
up
to
that
date
about
this
part
of
the
world
it
is
interesting
reading
and
to
the
antarctic
student
it
proves
how
little
was
known
in
some
branches
of
science
at
that
date
and
what
strides
were
made
during
the
next
few
years
to
read
what
was
known
of
the
birds
and
beasts
of
the
antarctic
and
then
to
read
zoological
report
of
the
discovery
expedition
is
an
education
in
what
one
man
can
still
do
in
an
part
of
the
world
to
elucidate
the
problems
which
await
him
the
teeth
of
a
seal
are
surmounted
by
perhaps
the
most
complicated
arrangement
of
cusps
found
in
any
living
mammal
the
mouth
is
so
arranged
that
the
teeth
of
the
upper
jaw
fit
into
those
of
the
lower
and
the
cusps
form
a
perfect
sieve
a
hitherto
unparalleled
function
for
the
teeth
of
a
mammal
the
food
of
this
seal
consists
mainly
of
euphausiae
animals
much
like
shrimps
which
it
doubtless
keeps
in
its
mouth
while
it
expels
the
water
through
its
teeth
like
those
whales
which
sift
their
food
through
their
baleen
plates
this
development
of
cusps
in
the
teeth
of
the
seal
is
probably
a
more
perfect
adaptation
to
this
purpose
than
in
any
other
mammal
and
has
been
produced
at
the
cost
of
all
usefulness
in
the
teeth
as
grinders
the
grit
however
which
forms
a
fairly
constant
part
of
the
contents
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
serves
no
doubt
to
grind
up
the
shells
of
the
crustaceans
and
in
this
way
the
necessity
for
grinders
is
completely
obviated
the
has
a
very
formidable
set
of
teeth
suitable
for
his
carnivorous
diet
the
weddell
living
on
fish
has
a
more
simple
group
but
these
are
liable
to
become
very
worn
in
old
age
due
to
his
habit
of
gnawing
out
holes
in
the
ice
for
himself
so
graphically
displayed
on
ponting
cinematograph
when
he
feels
death
approaching
the
seal
never
inclined
to
live
in
the
company
of
more
than
a
few
of
his
kind
becomes
still
more
solitary
the
weddell
seal
will
travel
far
up
the
glaciers
of
south
victoria
land
and
there
we
have
found
them
lying
dead
but
the
seal
will
wander
even
farther
he
leaves
the
pack
thirty
miles
from
the
and
feet
above
their
carcases
were
found
on
quite
a
number
of
occasions
and
it
is
hard
to
account
for
such
vagaries
on
other
grounds
than
that
a
sick
animal
will
go
any
distance
to
get
away
from
its
companions
and
perhaps
it
should
be
added
from
its
enemies
often
the
under
sides
of
the
floes
were
coloured
a
peculiar
yellow
this
coloration
is
caused
by
minute
unicellular
plants
called
diatoms
the
floating
life
of
the
antarctic
is
most
dense
diatoms
were
so
abundant
in
parts
of
the
ross
sea
that
a
large
plankton
net
meshes
to
an
inch
became
choked
in
a
few
minutes
with
them
and
other
members
of
the
phytoplankton
it
is
extremely
probable
that
in
such
localities
whales
feed
upon
the
plants
as
well
as
the
animals
of
the
plankton
i
do
not
know
to
what
extent
these
open
waters
are
frequented
by
whales
during
the
winter
but
in
the
summer
months
they
are
full
of
them
right
down
to
the
fringe
of
the
continent
most
common
of
all
is
the
kind
of
known
as
the
killer
whale
who
measures
feet
long
he
hunts
in
packs
up
to
at
least
a
hundred
strong
and
as
we
now
know
he
does
not
confine
his
attacks
to
seal
and
other
whales
but
will
also
hunt
man
though
perhaps
he
mistakes
him
for
a
seal
this
whale
is
a
toothed
beast
and
a
and
is
more
properly
a
dolphin
but
it
seems
that
there
are
at
least
five
or
six
other
kinds
of
whales
some
of
which
do
not
penetrate
south
of
the
pack
while
others
cruise
in
large
numbers
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
fast
ice
they
feed
upon
the
minute
surface
life
of
these
seas
and
large
numbers
of
them
were
seen
not
only
by
the
terra
nova
on
her
various
cruises
but
also
by
the
shore
parties
in
the
waters
of
mcmurdo
sound
in
both
wilson
and
lillie
we
had
skilled
whale
observers
and
their
work
has
gone
far
to
elucidate
the
still
obscure
questions
of
whale
distribution
in
the
south
the
offers
excellent
opportunities
for
the
identification
of
whales
because
their
movements
are
more
restricted
than
in
the
open
ocean
in
order
to
identify
the
observer
generally
has
only
the
blow
and
then
the
shape
of
the
back
and
fin
as
the
whale
goes
down
to
guide
him
in
the
pack
he
sometimes
gets
more
as
in
the
case
of
balaenoptera
acutorostrata
piked
whale
on
march
the
ship
was
ploughing
her
way
through
thick
in
which
the
water
was
freezing
between
the
floes
so
that
the
only
open
spaces
for
miles
around
were
those
made
by
the
slow
movement
of
the
ship
we
saw
several
of
these
whales
during
the
day
making
use
of
the
holes
in
the
ice
near
the
ship
for
the
purpose
of
blowing
there
was
scarcely
room
between
the
floes
for
the
whales
to
come
up
to
blow
in
their
usual
manner
which
consists
in
rising
almost
horizontally
and
breaking
the
surface
of
the
water
with
their
backs
on
this
occasion
they
pushed
their
snouts
obliquely
out
of
the
water
nearly
as
far
as
the
eye
and
after
blowing
withdrew
them
below
the
water
again
commander
pennell
noted
that
several
times
one
rested
its
head
on
a
floe
not
twenty
feet
from
the
ship
with
its
nostrils
just
on
the
raising
itself
a
few
inches
it
would
blow
and
then
subside
again
for
a
few
minutes
to
its
original
position
with
its
snout
resting
on
the
floe
they
took
no
notice
of
pieces
of
coal
which
were
thrown
at
them
by
the
men
on
board
the
ship
but
no
whale
which
we
saw
in
the
pack
and
we
often
saw
it
elsewhere
also
was
so
imposing
as
the
great
blue
whale
some
of
which
were
possibly
more
than
feet
long
we
used
to
watch
this
huge
whale
come
to
the
surface
again
and
again
to
blow
at
intervals
of
thirty
to
forty
seconds
and
from
the
fact
that
at
each
of
four
or
five
appearances
no
vestige
of
a
dorsal
fin
was
visible
we
began
to
wonder
whether
we
had
not
found
the
right
whale
that
was
once
reported
to
be
so
abundant
in
ross
sea
again
and
again
the
spout
went
up
into
the
cold
air
a
white
column
of
condensed
moisture
followed
by
a
smooth
broad
back
and
yet
no
fin
for
some
time
we
remained
uncertain
as
to
its
identity
till
at
last
in
sounding
for
a
longer
disappearance
and
a
greater
depth
than
usual
the
hinder
third
of
the
enormous
beast
appeared
above
the
surface
for
the
first
time
with
its
little
angular
dorsal
fin
at
once
dispelling
any
doubts
we
might
have
had
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
largest
mammal
that
has
ever
existed
as
it
comes
up
to
blow
one
sees
first
a
small
dark
hump
appear
and
then
immediately
a
jet
of
grey
fog
squirted
upwards
fifteen
to
eighteen
feet
gradually
spreading
as
it
rises
vertically
into
the
frosty
air
i
have
been
nearly
in
these
blows
once
or
twice
and
had
the
moisture
in
my
face
with
a
sickening
smell
of
shrimpy
oil
then
the
hump
elongates
and
up
rolls
an
immense
or
round
back
with
a
faint
ridge
along
the
top
on
which
presently
appears
a
small
dorsal
fin
and
then
the
whole
sinks
and
disappears
to
the
biologist
the
pack
is
of
absorbing
interest
if
you
want
to
see
life
naked
and
unashamed
study
the
struggles
of
this
from
the
diatom
in
the
to
the
big
killer
whale
each
stage
essential
to
the
life
of
the
stage
above
and
living
on
the
stage
below
the
protoplasmic
cycle
big
floes
have
little
floes
all
around
about
and
all
the
yellow
diatoms
could
do
without
forty
million
shrimplets
feed
upon
the
latter
and
make
the
penguin
and
the
seals
and
whales
much
fatter
along
comes
the
orca
and
kills
these
down
below
while
up
above
the
afterguard
attack
them
on
the
floe
and
if
a
sailor
tumbles
in
and
stoves
the
mushy
pack
in
he
crumpled
up
between
the
floes
and
so
they
get
whack
in
then
there
no
doubt
he
soon
becomes
a
patent
fertilizer
invigorating
diatoms
although
they
none
the
wiser
so
the
protoplasm
passes
on
its
round
like
a
huge
recurring
decimal
to
which
no
end
is
found
we
were
early
on
the
scene
compared
with
previous
expeditions
but
i
do
not
suppose
this
alone
can
explain
the
extremely
heavy
ice
conditions
we
met
possibly
we
were
too
far
east
our
progress
was
very
slow
and
often
we
were
hung
up
for
days
at
a
time
motionless
and
immovable
the
pack
all
close
about
us
patience
and
always
more
patience
from
the
masthead
one
can
see
a
few
patches
of
open
water
in
different
directions
but
the
main
outlook
is
the
same
scene
of
desolate
hummocky
pack
and
again
we
have
scarcely
moved
all
day
but
bergs
which
have
become
quite
old
friends
are
on
the
move
and
one
has
approached
and
almost
circled
us
and
then
without
warning
and
reason
as
far
as
we
could
see
it
would
open
out
again
and
broad
black
leads
and
lakes
would
appear
where
there
had
been
only
white
snow
and
ice
before
and
we
would
make
just
a
few
more
miles
and
sometimes
we
would
raise
steam
only
to
suffer
further
disappointment

in
the
sky
mean
ice
and
this
is
known
as
the
changes
were
as
sudden
as
they
were
unexpected
thus
early
in
the
morning
of
christmas
eve
about
a
fortnight
after
we
had
entered
the
pack
we
have
come
into
a
region
of
where
the
open
water
exceeds
the
ice
the
former
lies
in
great
irregular
pools
three
or
four
miles
or
more
across
and
connecting
with
many
leads
the
latter
and
the
fact
is
puzzling
still
contain
floes
of
enormous
dimensions
we
have
just
passed
one
which
is
at
least
two
miles
in
diameter
and
then
alas
alas
at
this
morning
we
were
brought
up
with
a
solid
sheet
of
pack
extending
in
all
directions
save
that
from
which
we
had
come
delay
was
always
irksome
to
scott
as
time
went
on
this
waiting
in
the
pack
became
almost
intolerable
he
began
to
think
we
might
have
to
winter
in
the
pack
and
all
the
time
our
scanty
supply
of
coal
was
being
eaten
up
until
it
was
said
that
campbell
party
would
never
be
taken
to
king
edward
vii
land
scott
found
decisions
to
bank
fires
to
raise
steam
or
to
let
fires
out
most
difficult
at
this
time
if
one
lets
fires
out
it
means
a
dead
loss
of
over
two
tons
when
the
boiler
has
to
be
heated
again
but
this
two
tons
would
only
cover
a
day
under
banked
fires
so
that
for
anything
longer
than
hours
it
is
economy
to
put
the
fires
out
at
each
stoppage
one
is
called
upon
to
decide
whether
it
is
to
be
for
more
or
less
than
hours
certainly
england
should
have
an
ship
for
polar
work
the
terra
nova
proved
a
wonderfully
fine
ice
ship
bowers
middle
watch
especially
became
famous
for
the
way
in
which
he
put
the
ship
at
the
ice
and
more
than
once
scott
was
alarmed
by
the
great
shock
and
collisions
which
were
the
result
i
have
seen
him
hurry
up
from
his
cabin
to
put
a
stop
to
it
but
bowers
never
hurt
the
ship
and
she
gallantly
responded
to
the
calls
made
upon
her
sometimes
it
was
a
matter
of
forcing
two
floes
apart
at
others
of
charging
and
breaking
one
often
we
went
again
and
again
at
some
stubborn
bit
backing
and
charging
alternately
as
well
as
the
space
behind
us
would
allow
if
sufficient
momentum
was
gained
the
ship
rode
upon
the
thicker
floes
rising
up
upon
it
and
pressing
it
down
beneath
her
until
suddenly
perhaps
when
its
nearest
edge
was
almost
amidships
the
weight
became
too
great
and
the
ice
split
beneath
us
at
other
times
a
tiny
crack
no
larger
than
a
vein
would
run
shivering
from
our
bows
which
widened
and
widened
until
the
whole
ship
passed
through
without
difficulty
always
when
below
one
heard
the
grumbling
of
the
ice
as
it
passed
along
the
side
but
it
was
slow
work
and
hard
on
the
engines
there
were
days
when
we
never
moved
at
all
i
can
imagine
few
things
more
trying
to
the
patience
than
the
long
wasted
days
of
waiting
exasperating
as
it
is
to
see
the
tons
of
coal
melting
away
with
the
smallest
mileage
to
our
credit
one
has
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
active
fighting
and
the
hope
of
better
fortune
to
wait
idly
is
the
worst
of
conditions
you
can
imagine
how
often
and
how
restlessly
we
climbed
to
the
crow
nest
and
studied
the
outlook
and
strangely
enough
there
was
generally
some
change
to
note
a
water
lead
would
mysteriously
open
up
a
few
miles
away
or
the
place
where
it
had
been
would
as
mysteriously
close
huge
icebergs
crept
silently
towards
or
past
us
and
continually
we
were
observing
these
formidable
objects
with
range
finder
and
compass
to
determine
the
relative
movement
sometimes
with
misgivings
as
to
our
ability
to
clear
them
under
steam
the
change
of
conditions
was
even
more
marked
sometimes
we
would
enter
a
lead
of
open
water
and
proceed
for
a
mile
or
two
without
hindrance
sometimes
we
would
come
to
big
sheets
of
thin
ice
which
broke
easily
as
our
prow
struck
them
and
sometimes
even
a
thin
sheet
would
resist
all
our
attempts
to
break
it
sometimes
we
would
push
big
floes
with
comparative
ease
and
sometimes
a
small
floe
would
bar
our
passage
with
such
obstinacy
that
one
would
almost
believe
it
possessed
of
an
evil
spirit
sometimes
we
passed
through
acres
of
sludgy
sodden
ice
which
hissed
as
it
swept
along
the
side
and
sometimes
the
hissing
ceased
seemingly
without
rhyme
or
reason
and
we
found
our
screw
churning
the
sea
without
any
effect
thus
the
steaming
days
passed
away
in
an
environment
and
are
remembered
as
an
unceasing
struggle
the
ship
behaved
splendidly
no
other
ship
not
even
the
discovery
would
have
come
through
so
well
certainly
the
nimrod
would
never
have
reached
the
south
water
had
she
been
caught
in
such
pack
as
a
result
i
have
grown
strangely
attached
to
the
terra
nova
as
she
bumped
the
floes
with
mighty
shocks
crushing
and
grinding
a
way
through
some
twisting
and
turning
to
avoid
others
she
seemed
like
a
living
thing
fighting
a
great
fight
if
only
she
had
more
economical
engines
she
would
be
suitable
in
all
respects
illustration
terra
nova
once
or
twice
we
got
among
floes
which
stood
or
feet
above
water
with
hummocks
and
pinnacles
as
high
as
feet
the
ship
could
have
stood
no
chance
had
such
floes
pressed
against
her
and
at
first
we
were
a
little
alarmed
in
such
situations
but
familiarity
breeds
contempt
there
never
was
any
pressure
in
the
heavy
ice
and
i
inclined
to
think
there
never
would
be
the
weather
changed
frequently
during
our
journey
through
the
pack
the
wind
blew
strong
from
the
west
and
from
the
east
the
sky
was
often
darkly
overcast
we
had
snowstorms
flaky
snow
and
even
light
rain
in
all
such
circumstances
we
were
better
placed
in
the
pack
than
outside
of
it
the
foulest
weather
could
do
us
little
harm
during
quite
a
large
percentage
of
days
however
we
had
bright
sunshine
which
even
with
the
temperature
well
below
freezing
made
everything
look
bright
and
cheerful
the
sun
also
brought
us
wonderful
cloud
effects
marvellously
delicate
tints
of
sky
cloud
and
ice
such
effects
as
one
might
travel
far
to
see
in
spite
of
our
impatience
we
would
not
willingly
have
missed
many
of
the
beautiful
scenes
which
our
sojourn
in
the
pack
afforded
us
ponting
and
wilson
have
been
busy
catching
these
effects
but
no
art
can
reproduce
such
colours
as
the
deep
blue
of
the
icebergs
as
a
rule
the
officer
of
the
watch
conned
from
the
crow
nest
shouting
his
orders
to
the
steersman
direct
and
to
the
through
the
midshipman
of
the
watch
who
stood
upon
the
bridge
it
is
thrilling
work
to
the
officer
in
charge
who
not
only
has
to
face
the
immediate
problem
of
what
floes
he
dare
and
what
he
dare
not
charge
but
also
to
puzzle
out
the
best
course
for
the
future
but
i
expect
he
soon
gets
sick
of
it
about
this
time
bowers
made
a
fancy
sketch
of
the
terra
nova
hitting
an
enormous
piece
of
ice
the
masts
are
all
whipped
forward
and
from
the
crow
nest
is
shot
first
the
officer
of
the
watch
followed
by
cigarette
ends
and
empty
cocoa
mugs
and
lastly
the
hay
with
which
the
floor
was
covered
upon
the
forecastle
stands
farmer
hayseed
oates
chewing
a
straw
with
the
greatest
composure
and
waiting
until
the
hay
shall
fall
at
his
feet
at
which
time
he
will
feed
it
to
his
ponies
this
nest
which
was
a
barrel
lashed
to
the
top
of
the
mainmast
to
which
entrance
was
gained
by
a
hinged
shielded
the
occupant
from
most
of
the
wind
i
am
not
sure
that
the
steersman
did
not
have
the
most
uninviting
job
but
hot
cocoa
is
a
most
comforting
drink
and
there
was
always
plenty
to
be
had
rennick
was
busy
sounding
the
depths
varied
from
to
at
least
fathoms
and
the
bottom
generally
showed
volcanic
deposits
our
line
of
soundings
showed
the
transition
from
the
ocean
depths
to
the
continental
shelf
a
series
of
temperatures
was
gained
by
nelson
by
means
of
reversible
thermometers
down
to
metres
the
winch
upon
which
the
sounding
line
was
wound
was
worked
by
hand
on
this
cruise
it
was
worked
mechanically
afterwards
and
of
course
this
ought
always
to
be
done
if
possible
just
now
it
was
a
wearisome
business
especially
when
we
lowered
a
bottle
one
day
to
metres
spent
hours
in
winding
it
up
and
found
it
still
open
when
it
arrived
at
the
surface
water
samples
were
also
obtained
at
the
various
depths
lillie
and
nelson
were
both
busy
for
plankton
with
apstein
nansen
nets
i
do
think
many
at
home
had
a
more
pleasant
christmas
day
than
we
it
was
beautifully
calm
with
the
pack
all
round
at
we
had
church
with
lots
of
christmas
hymns
and
then
decorated
the
with
all
our
sledging
flags
these
flags
are
carried
by
officers
on
arctic
expeditions
and
are
formed
of
the
george
cross
with
a
continuation
ending
in
a
in
the
heraldic
colours
to
which
the
individual
is
entitled
and
upon
this
is
embroidered
his
crest
the
men
forrard
had
their
christmas
dinner
of
fresh
mutton
at
there
was
plenty
of
penguin
for
them
but
curiously
enough
they
did
not
think
it
good
enough
for
a
christmas
dinner
the
ate
penguin
in
the
evening
and
after
the
toast
of
friends
we
began
to
sing
and
twice
round
the
table
everybody
had
to
contribute
a
song
ponting
banjo
songs
were
a
great
success
also
oates
vly
on
the
meares
sang
a
little
song
about
our
expedition
and
many
of
the
members
that
southward
would
go
of
his
own
composition
the
general
result
was
that
the
watches
were
all
over
the
place
that
night
at
day
whispered
in
my
ear
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
and
pennell
promised
to
call
me
if
there
was
so
i
remembered
no
more
until
past
six
and
crean
rabbit
gave
birth
to
seventeen
little
ones
and
it
was
said
that
crean
had
already
given
away
we
had
stopped
and
banked
fires
against
an
immense
composite
floe
on
the
evening
of
christmas
eve
how
we
watched
the
little
changes
in
the
ice
and
the
wind
and
scanned
the
horizon
for
those
black
patches
which
meant
open
water
ahead
but
always
there
was
that
same
white
sky
to
the
south
of
us
and
then
one
day
there
came
the
shadow
of
movement
on
the
sea
the
faintest
crush
on
the
brash
ice
the
whisper
of
great
disturbances
afar
off
it
settled
again
our
hopes
were
dashed
to
the
ground
then
came
the
wind
it
was
so
thick
that
we
could
not
see
far
but
even
in
our
restricted
field
changes
were
in
progress
we
commence
to
move
between
two
floes
make
or
yards
and
are
then
brought
up
bows
on
to
a
large
lump
this
may
mean
a
wait
of
anything
from
ten
minutes
to
whilst
the
ship
swings
round
falls
away
and
drifts
to
leeward
when
clear
she
forges
ahead
again
and
the
operation
is
repeated
occasionally
when
she
can
get
a
little
way
on
she
cracks
the
obstacle
and
slowly
passes
through
it
there
is
a
distinct
swell
very
long
very
low
i
counted
the
period
as
about
nine
seconds
every
one
says
the
ice
is
breaking
up
on
december
the
gale
abated
the
sky
cleared
and
showed
signs
of
open
water
ahead
it
was
cold
in
the
wind
but
the
sun
was
wonderful
and
we
lay
out
on
deck
and
basked
in
its
warmth
a
cheerful
careless
crowd
after
breakfast
there
was
a
consultation
between
scott
and
wilson
in
the
crow
nest
it
was
decided
to
raise
steam
meanwhile
we
sounded
and
found
a
volcanic
muddy
bottom
at
fathoms
the
last
sounding
showed
fathoms
we
had
passed
over
a
bank
steam
came
at
and
we
began
to
push
forward
at
first
it
was
hard
going
but
slowly
we
elbowed
our
way
until
the
spaces
of
open
water
became
more
frequent
soon
we
found
one
or
two
large
pools
several
miles
in
extent
then
the
floes
became
smaller
later
we
could
see
no
really
big
floes
at
all
the
sheets
of
thin
ice
are
broken
into
comparatively
regular
figures
none
more
than
thirty
yards
across
and
we
are
steaming
amongst
floes
of
small
area
evidently
broken
by
swell
and
with
edges
abraded
by
contact
we
could
not
be
far
from
the
southern
edge
of
the
pack
hours
after
raising
steam
we
were
still
making
good
progress
checking
sometimes
to
carve
our
way
through
some
obstacle
at
last
we
were
getting
a
return
for
the
precious
coal
expended
the
sky
was
overcast
the
outlook
from
the
masthead
flat
and
dreary
but
hour
by
hour
it
became
more
obvious
that
we
neared
the
threshold
of
the
open
sea

on

thus
titus
oates
quietly
to
me
a
few
hours
before
we
left
the
pack
i
went
and
looked
at
the
barograph
and
it
made
me
feel
within
a
few
hours
i
was
sick
sick
but
we
newcomers
to
the
antarctic
had
yet
to
learn
that
we
knew
nothing
about
its
barometer
nothing
very
terrible
happened
after
all
when
i
got
up
to
the
bridge
for
the
morning
watch
we
were
in
open
water
and
it
was
blowing
fresh
it
freshened
all
day
and
by
the
evening
it
was
blowing
a
southerly
with
a
short
choppy
north
sea
swell
and
very
warm
by
the
next
morning
there
was
a
big
sea
running
and
the
dogs
and
ponies
were
having
a
bad
time
rennick
had
the
morning
watch
these
days
and
i
was
his
humble
midshipman
at
we
sighted
what
we
thought
was
a
berg
on
the
port
bow
about
three
minutes
later
rennick
said
there
a
bit
of
pack
and
i
went
below
and
reported
to
evans
it
was
very
thick
with
driving
snow
and
also
foggy
and
before
evans
got
up
to
the
bridge
we
were
quite
near
the
pack
and
amongst
bits
which
had
floated
from
it
one
of
which
must
have
been
our
berg
we
took
in
the
headsails
as
quickly
as
possible
these
being
the
only
sails
set
and
nosed
along
dead
slow
to
leeward
under
steam
alone
gradually
we
could
see
either
pack
or
the
blink
of
it
all
along
our
port
and
starboard
beam
while
gradually
we
felt
our
way
down
a
big
patch
of
open
water
there
was
quite
a
meeting
on
the
bridge
and
it
was
decided
to
get
well
in
and
lie
in
open
water
under
lee
of
the
pack
till
the
gale
blew
itself
out
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
safe
course
would
have
been
to
go
about
and
stand
to
the
east
but
in
our
case
we
must
risk
trouble
to
get
smoother
water
for
the
ponies
we
passed
a
stream
of
ice
over
which
the
sea
was
breaking
heavily
and
one
realized
the
danger
of
being
amongst
loose
floes
in
such
a
sea
but
soon
we
came
to
a
compacter
body
of
floes
and
running
behind
this
we
were
agreeably
surprised
to
find
comparatively
smooth
water
we
ran
on
for
a
bit
then
stopped
and
lay
to
all
that
day
we
lay
behind
that
pack
steaming
slowly
to
leeward
every
now
and
then
as
the
ice
drifted
down
upon
us
towards
night
it
began
to
clear
it
was
new
year
eve
i
turned
in
thinking
to
wake
in
but
i
had
not
been
long
asleep
when
i
found
atkinson
at
my
side
have
you
seen
the
land
he
said
wrap
your
blankets
round
you
and
go
and
see
and
when
i
got
up
on
deck
i
could
see
nothing
for
a
while
then
he
said
all
the
high
lights
are
snow
lit
up
by
the
sun
and
there
they
were
the
most
glorious
peaks
appearing
as
it
were
like
satin
above
the
clouds
the
only
white
in
a
dark
horizon
the
first
glimpse
of
antarctic
land
sabine
and
the
great
mountains
of
the
admiralty
range
they
were
miles
away
but
icy
mountains
high
on
mountains
seem
to
the
shivering
sailor
from
afar
shapeless
and
white
an
atmosphere
of
cloud
and
truth
to
tell
i
went
back
to
my
warm
bunk
at
midnight
a
rowdy
mob
ringing
the
new
year
in
with
the
burst
into
our
nursery
i
expected
to
be
hauled
out
but
got
off
with
a
dig
in
the
ribs
from
birdie
bowers
in
brilliant
sunshine
we
coasted
down
victoria
land
it
is
absolutely
calm
with
glorious
bright
sunshine
several
people
were
sunning
themselves
at
sitting
on
deck
and
reading
at
on
monday
night
january
we
sighted
erebus
miles
away
the
next
morning
most
of
us
were
on
the
yards
furling
sail
we
were
heading
for
cape
crozier
the
northern
face
of
ross
island
was
open
to
our
fascinated
gaze
and
away
to
the
east
stretched
the
barrier
face
until
it
disappeared
below
the
horizon
adélie
penguins
and
killer
whales
were
abundant
in
the
water
through
which
we
steamed
i
have
seen
fuji
the
most
dainty
and
graceful
of
all
mountains
and
also
kinchinjunga
only
michael
angelo
among
men
could
have
conceived
such
grandeur
but
give
me
erebus
for
my
friend
whoever
made
erebus
knew
all
the
charm
of
horizontal
lines
and
the
lines
of
erebus
are
for
the
most
part
nearer
the
horizontal
than
the
vertical
and
so
he
is
the
most
restful
mountain
in
the
world
and
i
was
glad
when
i
knew
that
our
hut
would
lie
at
his
feet
and
always
there
floated
from
his
crater
the
lazy
banner
of
his
cloud
of
steam
now
we
had
reached
the
barrier
face
some
five
miles
east
of
the
point
at
which
it
joins
the
basalt
cliffs
of
cape
crozier
we
could
see
the
great
pressure
waves
which
had
proved
such
an
obstacle
to
travellers
from
the
discovery
to
the
emperor
penguin
rookery
the
knoll
was
clear
but
the
summit
of
mount
terror
was
in
the
clouds
as
for
the
barrier
we
seemed
to
have
known
it
all
our
lives
it
was
so
exactly
like
what
we
had
imagined
it
to
be
and
seen
in
the
pictures
and
photographs
scott
had
a
whaler
launched
and
we
pulled
in
under
the
cliffs
there
was
a
considerable
swell
we
were
to
examine
the
possibilities
of
landing
but
the
swell
was
so
heavy
in
its
break
among
the
floating
blocks
of
ice
along
the
actual
beach
and
ice
foot
that
a
landing
was
out
of
the
question
we
should
have
broken
up
the
boat
and
have
all
been
in
the
water
together
but
i
assure
you
it
was
tantalizing
to
me
for
there
about
six
feet
above
us
on
a
small
dirty
piece
of
the
old
bay
ice
about
ten
feet
square
one
living
emperor
penguin
chick
was
standing
disconsolately
stranded
and
close
by
stood
one
faithful
old
emperor
parent
asleep
this
young
emperor
was
still
in
the
down
a
most
interesting
fact
in
the
bird
life
history
at
which
we
had
rightly
guessed
but
which
no
one
had
actually
observed
before
it
was
in
a
stage
never
yet
seen
or
collected
for
the
wings
were
already
quite
clean
of
down
and
feathered
as
in
the
adult
also
a
line
down
the
breast
was
shed
of
down
and
part
of
the
head
this
bird
would
have
been
a
treasure
to
me
but
we
could
not
risk
life
for
it
so
it
had
to
remain
where
it
was
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
with
as
much
clean
ice
to
live
on
as
they
could
have
wished
for
these
destitute
derelicts
of
a
flourishing
colony
now
gone
north
to
sea
on
floating
bay
ice
should
have
preferred
to
remain
standing
on
the
only
piece
of
bay
ice
left
a
piece
about
ten
feet
square
and
now
pressed
up
six
feet
above
water
level
evidently
wondering
why
it
was
so
long
in
starting
north
with
the
general
exodus
which
must
have
taken
place
just
a
month
ago
the
whole
incident
was
most
interesting
and
full
of
suggestion
as
to
the
slow
working
of
the
brain
of
these
queer
people
another
point
was
most
weird
to
see
that
on
the
side
of
this
very
dirty
piece
of
which
was
about
two
feet
thick
and
which
hung
over
the
water
as
a
sort
of
cave
we
could
see
the
legs
and
lower
halves
of
dead
emperor
chicks
hanging
through
and
even
in
one
place
a
dead
adult
i
hope
to
make
a
picture
of
the
whole
quaint
incident
for
it
was
a
corner
crammed
full
of
imperial
history
in
the
light
of
what
we
already
knew
and
it
would
otherwise
have
been
about
as
unintelligible
as
any
group
of
animate
or
inanimate
nature
could
possibly
have
been
as
it
is
it
throws
more
light
on
the
life
history
of
this
strangely
primitive
bird
we
were
joking
in
the
boat
as
we
rowed
under
these
cliffs
and
saying
it
would
be
a
amusement
to
see
the
overhanging
cliff
part
company
and
fall
on
us
so
we
were
glad
to
find
that
we
were
rowing
back
to
the
ship
and
already
or
yards
away
from
the
place
and
in
open
water
when
there
was
a
noise
like
crackling
thunder
and
a
huge
plunge
into
the
sea
and
a
smother
of
rock
dust
like
the
smoke
of
an
explosion
and
we
realized
that
the
very
thing
had
happened
which
we
had
just
been
talking
about
altogether
it
was
a
very
exciting
row
for
before
we
got
on
board
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
ship
shoved
in
so
close
to
these
cliffs
by
a
belt
of
heavy
pack
ice
that
to
us
it
appeared
a
whether
she
got
out
again
or
got
forced
in
against
the
rocks
she
had
no
time
or
room
to
turn
and
got
clear
by
backing
out
through
the
belt
of
pack
stern
first
getting
heavy
bumps
under
the
counter
and
on
the
rudder
as
she
did
so
for
the
ice
was
heavy
and
the
swell
considerable
westward
of
cape
crozier
the
sides
of
mount
terror
slope
down
to
the
sea
forming
a
possible
in
calm
weather
here
there
is
a
large
adélie
penguin
rookery
in
summer
and
it
was
here
that
the
discovery
left
a
record
of
her
movements
tied
to
a
post
to
guide
the
relieving
ship
the
following
year
it
was
the
return
of
a
sledge
party
which
tried
to
reach
this
record
from
the
barrier
that
led
to
vince
terrible
death
as
we
coasted
along
we
could
see
this
post
quite
plainly
looking
as
new
as
the
day
it
was
erected
and
we
know
now
that
there
is
communication
with
the
barrier
behind
while
this
rookery
itself
is
free
from
the
blizzards
which
sweep
out
to
sea
by
cape
crozier
it
was
therefore
an
excellent
place
to
winter
and
it
was
a
considerable
disappointment
to
find
that
it
was
impossible
to
land
this
was
the
first
sight
we
had
of
a
rookery
of
the
little
adélie
penguin
hundreds
of
thousands
of
birds
dotted
the
shore
and
there
were
many
thousands
in
the
sea
round
the
ship
as
we
came
to
know
these
rookeries
better
we
came
to
look
upon
these
quaint
creatures
more
as
familiar
friends
than
as
casual
acquaintances
whatever
a
penguin
does
has
individuality
and
he
lays
bare
his
whole
life
for
all
to
see
he
can
not
fly
away
and
because
he
is
quaint
in
all
that
he
does
but
still
more
because
he
is
fighting
against
bigger
odds
than
any
other
bird
and
fighting
always
with
the
most
gallant
pluck
he
comes
to
be
considered
as
something
apart
from
the
ordinary
bird
sometimes
solemn
sometimes
humorous
enterprising
chivalrous
cheeky
and
always
unless
you
are
driving
a
a
welcome
and
in
some
ways
an
almost
human
friend
the
alternative
to
cape
crozier
was
somewhere
in
mcmurdo
sound
the
essential
thing
being
that
we
should
have
access
to
and
from
the
barrier
such
communication
having
to
be
by
since
the
land
is
for
the
most
part
impassable
as
we
steamed
from
cape
crozier
to
cape
bird
the
extremity
of
ross
island
we
carried
out
a
detailed
running
survey
when
we
neared
cape
bird
and
beaufort
island
we
could
see
that
there
was
much
pack
in
the
mouth
of
the
strait
by
keeping
close
in
to
the
land
we
avoided
the
worst
of
the
trouble
and
as
we
rounded
cape
bird
we
came
in
sight
of
the
old
landmarks
mount
discovery
and
the
western
mountains
seen
dimly
through
a
hazy
atmosphere
it
was
good
to
see
them
again
and
perhaps
after
all
we
are
better
this
side
of
the
island
it
gives
one
a
homely
feeling
to
see
such
a
familiar
scene
right
round
from
cape
crozier
to
cape
royds
the
coast
is
cold
and
forbidding
and
for
the
most
part
heavily
crevassed
west
of
cape
bird
are
some
small
penguin
rookeries
and
high
up
on
the
ice
slopes
could
be
seen
some
grey
granite
boulders
these
are
erratics
brought
by
ice
from
the
western
mountains
and
are
evidence
of
a
warmer
past
when
the
barrier
rose
some
two
thousand
feet
higher
than
it
does
now
and
stretched
many
hundreds
of
miles
farther
out
to
sea
but
now
the
antarctic
is
becoming
colder
the
deposition
of
snow
is
therefore
farther
north
and
the
formation
of
ice
correspondingly
less

many
watched
all
night
as
this
new
world
unfolded
itself
cape
by
cape
and
mountain
by
mountain
we
pushed
through
some
heavy
floes
and
at
on
january
we
came
through
the
last
of
the
strait
pack
some
three
miles
north
of
cape
royds
we
steered
for
the
cape
fully
expecting
to
find
the
edge
of
the
ranging
westward
from
it
to
our
astonishment
we
ran
on
past
the
cape
with
clear
water
or
thin
sludge
ice
on
all
sides
of
us
past
cape
royds
past
cape
barne
past
the
glacier
on
its
south
side
and
finally
round
and
past
inaccessible
island
a
good
two
miles
south
of
cape
royds
the
cape
itself
was
cut
off
from
the
south
we
could
have
gone
farther
but
the
last
sludge
ice
seemed
to
be
increasing
in
thickness
and
there
was
no
wintering
spot
to
aim
for
but
cape
armitage
i
have
never
seen
the
ice
of
the
sound
in
such
a
condition
or
the
land
so
free
from
snow
taking
these
facts
in
conjunction
with
the
exceptional
warmth
of
the
air
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
had
been
an
exceptionally
warm
summer
at
this
point
it
was
evident
that
we
had
a
considerable
choice
of
wintering
spots
we
could
have
gone
to
either
of
the
small
islands
to
the
mainland
the
glacier
tongue
or
pretty
well
anywhere
except
hut
point
my
main
wish
was
to
choose
a
place
that
would
not
be
easily
cut
off
from
the
barrier
and
my
eye
fell
on
a
cape
which
we
used
to
call
the
skuary
a
little
behind
us
it
was
separated
from
the
old
discovery
quarters
by
two
deep
bays
on
either
side
of
the
glacier
tongue
and
i
thought
that
these
bays
would
remain
frozen
until
late
in
the
season
and
that
when
they
froze
over
again
the
ice
would
soon
become
firm
i
called
a
council
and
put
these
propositions
to
push
on
to
the
glacier
tongue
and
winter
there
to
push
west
to
the
ice
and
to
make
our
way
to
an
inviting
spot
to
the
northward
of
the
cape
we
used
to
call
skuary
i
favoured
the
latter
course
and
on
discussion
we
found
it
obviously
the
best
so
we
turned
back
close
around
inaccessible
island
and
steered
for
the
fast
ice
off
the
cape
at
full
speed
after
piercing
a
small
fringe
of
thin
ice
at
the
edge
of
the
fast
floe
the
ship
stem
struck
heavily
on
hard
bay
ice
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
shore
here
was
a
road
to
the
cape
and
a
solid
wharf
on
which
to
land
our
stores
we
made
fast
with
scott
wilson
and
evans
walked
away
over
the
but
were
soon
back
they
reported
an
excellent
site
for
a
hut
on
a
shelving
beach
on
the
northern
side
of
the
cape
before
us
which
was
henceforward
called
cape
evans
after
our
second
in
command
landing
was
to
begin
forthwith
first
came
the
two
big
motor
sledges
which
took
up
so
much
of
our
deck
space
in
spite
of
the
hundreds
of
tons
of
which
had
washed
over
and
about
them
they
came
out
of
their
big
crates
looking
as
fresh
and
clean
as
if
they
had
been
packed
on
the
previous
day
they
were
running
that
same
afternoon
we
had
a
for
the
ponies
which
came
next
but
it
wanted
all
oates
skill
and
persuasion
to
get
them
into
it
all
seventeen
of
them
were
soon
on
the
floe
rolling
and
kicking
with
joy
and
thence
they
were
led
across
to
the
beach
where
they
were
carefully
picketed
to
a
rope
run
over
a
snow
slope
where
they
could
not
eat
sand
shackleton
lost
four
out
of
eight
ponies
within
a
month
of
his
arrival
his
ponies
were
picketed
on
rubbly
ground
at
cape
royds
and
ate
the
sand
for
the
salt
flavour
it
possessed
the
fourth
pony
died
from
eating
shavings
in
which
chemicals
had
been
packed
this
does
not
mean
that
they
were
hungry
merely
that
these
manchurian
ponies
eat
the
first
thing
that
comes
in
their
way
whether
it
be
a
bit
of
sugar
or
a
bit
of
erebus
meanwhile
the
were
running
light
loads
between
the
ship
and
the
shore
the
great
trouble
with
them
has
been
due
to
the
fatuous
conduct
of
the
penguins
groups
of
these
have
been
constantly
leaping
on
to
our
floe
from
the
moment
of
landing
on
their
feet
their
whole
attitude
expressed
devouring
curiosity
and
a
disregard
for
their
own
safety
they
waddle
forward
poking
their
heads
to
and
fro
in
their
usually
absurd
way
in
spite
of
a
string
of
howling
dogs
straining
to
get
at
them
they
seem
to
say
a
game
what
do
all
you
ridiculous
things
want
and
they
come
a
few
steps
nearer
the
dogs
make
a
rush
as
far
as
their
harness
or
leashes
allow
the
penguins
are
not
daunted
in
the
least
but
their
ruffs
go
up
and
they
squawk
with
semblance
of
anger
for
all
the
world
as
though
they
were
rebutting
a
rude
stranger
their
attitude
might
be
imagined
to
convey
the
sort
of
animal
you
are
well
you
come
to
the
wrong
place
we
are
going
to
be
bluffed
and
bounced
by
you
and
then
the
final
fatal
steps
forward
are
taken
and
they
come
within
reach
there
is
a
spring
a
squawk
a
horrid
red
patch
on
the
snow
and
the
incident
is
closed
everything
had
to
be
sledged
nearly
a
mile
and
a
half
across
the
but
at
midnight
after
seventeen
hours
continuous
work
the
position
was
most
satisfactory
the
large
amount
of
timber
which
went
to
make
the
hut
was
mostly
landed
the
ponies
and
dogs
were
sleeping
in
the
sun
on
shore
a
large
green
tent
housed
the
hut
builders
and
the
site
for
the
hut
was
levelled
such
weather
in
such
a
place
comes
nearer
to
satisfying
my
ideal
of
perfection
than
any
condition
i
have
ever
experienced
the
warm
glow
of
the
sun
with
the
keen
invigorating
cold
of
the
air
forms
a
combination
which
is
inexpressibly
and
satisfying
to
me
whilst
the
golden
light
on
this
wonderful
scene
of
mountain
and
ice
satisfies
every
claim
of
scenic
magnificence
no
words
of
mine
can
convey
the
impressiveness
of
the
wonderful
panorama
displayed
to
our
eyes
splendid
to
see
at
last
the
effect
of
all
the
months
of
preparation
and
organisation
there
is
much
snoring
about
me
as
i
write
from
men
tired
after
a
hard
day
work
and
preparing
for
such
another
i
also
must
sleep
for
i
have
had
none
for
hours
but
it
should
be
to
dream
happily
getting
to
bed
about
midnight
and
turning
out
at
we
kept
it
up
day
after
day
petrol
paraffin
pony
food
dog
food
sledges
and
sledging
gear
hut
furniture
provisions
of
all
kinds
both
for
life
at
the
hut
and
for
sledging
coal
scientific
instruments
and
gear
carbide
medical
stores
clothing
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
we
sledged
over
that
but
i
do
know
that
we
were
landed
as
regards
all
essentials
in
six
days
nothing
like
it
has
been
done
before
nothing
so
expeditious
and
complete
and
words
can
not
express
the
splendid
way
in
which
every
one
works
the
two
motors
the
two
parties
and
as
they
were
passed
for
work
by
oates
the
ponies
all
took
part
in
this
transport
as
usual
bowers
knew
just
where
everything
was
and
where
it
was
to
go
and
he
was
most
ably
seconded
on
the
ship
by
rennick
and
bruce
both
parties
and
commonly
did
ten
journeys
a
day
a
distance
of
over
thirty
miles
the
ponies
themselves
did
one
to
three
or
four
journeys
as
they
were
considered
fit
generally
speaking
the
transport
seemed
satisfactory
but
it
soon
became
clear
that
was
very
hard
on
the
motor
sledge
runners
the
motor
sledges
are
working
well
but
not
very
well
the
small
difficulties
will
be
got
over
but
i
rather
fear
they
will
never
draw
the
loads
we
expect
of
them
still
they
promise
to
be
a
help
and
they
are
a
lively
and
attractive
feature
of
our
present
scene
as
they
drone
along
over
the
floe
at
a
little
distance
without
silencers
they
sound
exactly
like
threshing
machines
the
ponies
were
the
real
problem
it
was
to
be
expected
that
they
would
be
helpless
and
exhausted
after
their
long
and
trying
voyage
not
a
bit
of
it
they
were
soon
rolling
about
biting
one
another
kicking
one
another
and
any
one
else
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
after
two
days
rest
on
shore
twelve
of
them
were
thought
fit
to
do
one
journey
on
which
they
pulled
loads
varying
from
to
lbs
with
ease
on
the
hard
surface
but
it
was
soon
clear
that
these
ponies
were
an
uneven
lot
there
were
the
steady
workers
like
punch
and
nobby
there
were
one
or
two
definitely
weak
ponies
like
blossom
blücher
and
jehu
and
there
were
one
or
two
strong
but
rather
impossible
beasts
one
of
these
was
soon
known
as
weary
willie
his
outward
appearance
belied
him
for
he
looked
like
a
pony
a
brief
acquaintance
soon
convinced
me
that
he
was
without
doubt
a
cross
between
a
pig
and
a
mule
he
was
obviously
a
strong
beast
and
since
he
always
went
as
slowly
as
possible
and
stopped
as
often
as
possible
it
was
most
difficult
to
form
any
opinion
as
to
what
load
he
was
really
able
to
draw
consequently
i
am
afraid
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
was
generally
overloaded
until
that
grim
day
on
the
barrier
when
he
was
set
upon
by
a
it
was
his
final
collapse
at
the
end
of
the
depôt
journey
which
caused
scott
to
stay
behind
when
we
went
out
on
the
but
of
that
i
shall
speak
again
twice
only
have
i
ever
seen
weary
willie
trot
we
were
leading
the
ponies
now
as
always
with
halters
and
without
bits
consequently
our
control
was
limited
especially
on
ice
but
doubtless
the
ponies
comfort
was
increased
especially
in
cold
weather
when
a
metal
bit
would
have
been
difficult
if
not
impossible
on
this
occasion
he
and
i
had
just
arrived
at
the
ship
after
a
trudge
in
which
i
seemed
to
be
pulling
both
weary
and
the
sledge
just
then
a
motor
and
we
started
back
across
that
floe
at
a
pace
which
surprised
weary
even
more
than
myself
for
he
fell
over
the
sledge
himself
and
me
and
for
days
i
felt
like
a
big
black
bruise
the
second
occasion
on
which
he
got
a
move
on
was
during
the
depôt
journey
when
gran
on
ski
tried
to
lead
him
christopher
and
hackenschmidt
were
impossible
ponies
christopher
as
we
shall
see
died
on
the
barrier
a
year
after
this
fighting
almost
to
the
last
hackenschmidt
so
called
from
his
vicious
habit
of
using
both
fore
and
hind
legs
in
attacking
those
who
came
near
him
led
an
even
more
lurid
life
but
had
a
more
peaceful
end
whether
oates
could
have
tamed
him
i
do
not
know
he
would
have
done
it
if
it
were
possible
for
his
management
of
horses
was
wonderful
but
in
any
case
hackenschmidt
sickened
at
the
hut
while
we
were
absent
on
the
depôt
journey
for
no
cause
which
could
be
ascertained
gradually
became
too
weak
to
stand
and
was
finally
put
out
of
his
misery
there
was
a
breathless
minute
when
hackenschmidt
with
a
sledge
attached
to
him
went
galloping
over
the
hills
and
boulders
below
him
all
unconscious
of
his
impending
fate
was
ponting
adjusting
a
large
camera
with
his
usual
accuracy
both
survived
there
were
runaways
innumerable
and
all
kinds
of
falls
but
these
ponies
could
tumble
about
unharmed
in
a
way
which
would
cause
an
english
horse
to
lie
up
for
a
week
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
bumping
of
the
sledges
close
at
the
heels
of
the
animals
is
the
root
of
the
evil
there
were
two
adventures
during
this
first
week
of
landing
stores
which
might
well
have
had
a
more
disastrous
conclusion
the
first
of
these
was
the
adventure
of
ponting
and
the
killer
whales
i
was
a
little
late
on
the
scene
this
morning
and
thereby
witnessed
a
most
extraordinary
scene
some
six
or
seven
killer
whales
old
and
young
were
skirting
the
fast
floe
edge
ahead
of
the
ship
they
seemed
excited
and
dived
rapidly
almost
touching
the
floe
as
we
watched
they
suddenly
appeared
astern
raising
their
snouts
out
of
water
i
had
heard
weird
stories
of
these
beasts
but
had
never
associated
serious
danger
with
them
close
to
the
water
edge
lay
the
wire
stern
rope
of
the
ship
and
our
two
esquimaux
dogs
were
tethered
to
this
i
did
not
think
of
connecting
the
movement
of
the
whales
with
this
fact
and
seeing
them
so
close
i
shouted
to
ponting
who
was
standing
abreast
of
the
ship
he
seized
his
camera
and
ran
towards
the
floe
edge
to
get
a
close
picture
of
the
beasts
which
had
momentarily
disappeared
the
next
moment
the
whole
floe
under
him
and
the
dogs
heaved
up
and
split
into
fragments
one
could
hear
the
booming
noise
as
the
whales
rose
under
the
ice
and
struck
it
with
their
backs
whale
after
whale
rose
under
the
ice
setting
it
rocking
fiercely
luckily
ponting
kept
his
feet
and
was
able
to
fly
to
security
by
an
extraordinary
chance
also
the
splits
had
been
made
around
and
between
the
dogs
so
that
neither
of
them
fell
into
the
water
then
it
was
clear
that
the
whales
shared
our
astonishment
for
one
after
another
their
huge
hideous
heads
shot
vertically
into
the
air
through
the
cracks
which
they
had
made
as
they
reared
them
to
a
height
of
six
or
eight
feet
it
was
possible
to
see
their
tawny
head
markings
their
small
glistening
eyes
and
their
terrible
array
of
teeth
by
far
the
largest
and
most
terrifying
in
the
world
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
that
they
looked
up
to
see
what
had
happened
to
ponting
and
the
dogs
the
latter
were
horribly
frightened
and
strained
to
their
chains
whining
the
head
of
one
killer
must
certainly
have
been
within
five
feet
of
one
of
the
dogs
after
this
whether
they
thought
the
game
insignificant
or
whether
they
missed
ponting
is
uncertain
but
the
terrifying
creatures
passed
on
to
other
hunting
grounds
and
we
were
able
to
rescue
the
dogs
and
what
was
even
more
important
our
petrol
five
or
six
tons
of
which
was
waiting
on
a
piece
of
ice
which
was
not
split
away
from
the
main
mass
of
course
we
have
known
well
that
killer
whales
continually
skirt
the
edge
of
the
floes
and
that
they
would
undoubtedly
snap
up
any
one
who
was
unfortunate
enough
to
fall
into
the
water
but
the
facts
that
they
could
display
such
deliberate
cunning
that
they
were
able
to
break
ice
of
such
thickness
at
least
feet
and
that
they
could
act
in
unison
were
a
revelation
to
us
it
is
clear
that
they
are
endowed
with
singular
intelligence
and
in
future
we
shall
treat
that
intelligence
with
every
respect
we
were
to
be
hunted
by
these
killer
whales
again
the
second
adventure
was
the
loss
of
the
third
motor
sledge
it
was
sunday
morning
january
and
scott
had
given
orders
that
this
motor
was
to
be
hoisted
out
of
the
ship
this
was
done
first
thing
and
the
motor
placed
on
firm
ice
later
campbell
told
me
one
of
the
men
had
dropped
a
leg
through
crossing
a
sludgy
patch
some
yards
from
the
ship
i
did
consider
it
very
serious
as
i
imagined
the
man
had
only
gone
through
the
surface
crust
about
i
started
for
the
shore
with
a
single
man
load
leaving
campbell
looking
about
for
the
best
crossing
for
the
motor
i
find
a
note
in
my
own
diary
as
to
what
happened
after
that
last
night
the
ice
was
getting
very
soft
in
places
and
i
was
a
little
doubtful
about
leading
ponies
over
a
spot
on
the
route
to
the
hut
which
is
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
ship
it
has
been
thawing
very
fast
the
last
few
days
and
has
been
very
hot
as
antarctic
weather
goes
this
morning
was
the
same
and
bailey
went
in
up
to
his
neck
some
after
the
motor
was
put
on
to
the
floe
we
were
told
to
tow
it
on
to
firm
ice
as
that
near
the
ship
was
breaking
up
all
hands
started
on
a
long
tow
line
we
got
on
to
the
rotten
piece
and
somebody
behind
shouted
must
run
from
that
moment
everything
happened
very
quickly
williamson
fell
right
in
through
the
ice
immediately
afterwards
we
were
all
brought
up
with
a
jerk
then
the
line
began
to
pull
us
backwards
the
stern
of
the
motor
had
sunk
through
the
ice
and
the
whole
car
began
to
sink
it
slowly
went
right
through
and
disappeared
and
then
the
tow
line
followed
it
everything
possible
was
done
to
hang
on
to
the
rope
but
in
the
end
we
had
to
let
it
go
each
man
keeping
his
hold
until
he
was
dragged
to
the
lip
of
the
hole
then
we
made
for
the
fast
ice
leaving
the
rotten
bit
between
us
and
the
ship
pennell
and
priestley
sounded
their
way
back
to
the
ship
and
day
asked
priestley
to
bring
his
goggles
when
he
returned
they
came
back
with
a
pennell
leading
suddenly
the
ice
gave
way
under
priestley
who
disappeared
entirely
and
came
up
so
we
learned
afterwards
under
the
ice
there
being
a
big
current
in
a
moment
pennell
was
lying
flat
upon
the
floe
on
his
chest
got
his
hand
under
priestley
arm
and
so
pulled
him
out
all
priestley
said
was
here
are
your
goggles
we
all
got
back
to
the
ship
but
communication
between
the
ship
and
the
shore
was
interrupted
for
the
rest
of
the
day
when
a
solid
road
was
found
right
up
to
the
ship
in
another
place
meanwhile
the
hut
was
rising
very
quickly
and
davies
who
was
chippy
chap
the
carpenter
deserves
much
credit
he
was
a
leading
shipwright
in
the
navy
always
willing
and
bright
and
with
a
very
thorough
knowledge
of
his
job
i
have
seen
him
called
up
hour
after
hour
day
and
night
on
the
ship
when
the
pumps
were
choked
by
the
coal
balls
which
formed
in
the
bilges
and
he
always
arrived
with
a
smile
on
his
face
altogether
he
was
one
of
our
most
useful
men
in
this
job
of
he
was
helped
by
two
of
our
seamen
keohane
and
abbott
and
others
latterly
i
believe
there
were
more
people
working
than
there
were
hammers
a
plan
of
this
hut
is
given
here
it
was
feet
long
by
feet
wide
and
feet
to
the
eaves
the
insulation
which
was
very
satisfactory
was
seaweed
sewn
up
in
the
form
of
a
quilt
the
sides
have
double
boarding
inside
and
outside
the
frames
with
a
layer
of
our
excellent
quilted
seaweed
insulation
between
each
pair
of
boardings
the
roof
has
a
single
inside
but
on
the
outside
is
a
then
a
layer
of
ruberoid
then
a
layer
of
quilted
seaweed
then
a
second
and
finally
a
cover
of
ruberoid
the
floor
consisted
of
a
wooden
boarding
next
the
frame
then
a
quilt
of
seaweed
then
a
layer
of
felt
upon
which
was
a
second
boarding
and
finally
linoleum
we
thought
we
should
be
warm
and
we
were
in
fact
during
the
winter
with
men
living
there
and
the
cooking
range
going
and
perhaps
also
the
stove
at
the
other
end
the
hut
not
infrequently
became
fuggy
big
though
it
was
the
entrance
was
through
a
door
in
a
porch
before
you
got
to
the
main
door
in
the
porch
were
the
generators
of
the
acetylene
gas
which
was
fitted
throughout
by
day
who
was
also
responsible
for
the
fittings
of
the
ventilator
cooking
range
and
stove
the
chimney
pipes
from
these
running
along
through
the
middle
of
the
hut
before
entering
a
common
vent
little
heat
was
lost
the
pipes
were
fitted
with
dampers
and
air
inlets
which
could
be
opened
or
shut
at
will
to
control
the
ventilation
besides
a
big
ventilator
in
the
top
of
the
hut
there
was
an
adjustable
air
inlet
also
at
the
base
of
the
chamber
which
formed
the
junction
of
the
two
chimneys
the
purpose
of
this
was
also
ventilation
but
it
was
not
successful
the
bulkhead
which
separated
the
men
quarters
or
mess
deck
from
the
rest
of
the
hut
was
formed
of
such
cases
as
contained
goods
in
glass
including
wine
which
would
have
frozen
and
broken
outside
the
bulkhead
did
not
go
as
high
as
the
top
of
the
hut
when
the
contents
of
a
case
were
wanted
a
side
of
the
box
was
taken
out
and
the
empty
case
then
formed
a
shelf
we
started
to
live
in
the
hut
on
january
beautifully
warm
the
gramophone
going
and
everybody
happy
but
for
a
long
time
before
this
most
of
the
landing
party
had
been
living
in
tents
on
shore
it
was
very
comfortable
far
more
so
than
might
be
supposed
judging
only
by
the
popular
idea
of
a
polar
life
we
were
now
almost
landed
there
were
just
a
few
things
more
to
come
over
from
the
ship
it
was
blowing
a
mild
blizzard
from
the
south
and
i
took
a
sledge
over
to
the
ship
which
was
quite
blotted
out
in
blinding
snow
at
times
it
was
as
hard
to
get
an
empty
sledge
over
as
generally
it
is
to
drag
a
full
one
tea
on
the
ship
which
was
very
full
of
welcome
but
also
very
full
of
the
superiority
of
their
own
comforts
over
those
of
the
land
their
own
comforts
were
not
so
very
obvious
since
they
had
tried
to
get
the
stove
in
the
wardroom
going
for
the
first
time
they
were
all
coughing
in
the
smoke
and
everything
inside
was
covered
with
smuts
the
hut
itself
was
some
twelve
feet
above
the
sea
and
situated
upon
what
was
now
an
almost
sandy
beach
of
black
lava
it
was
thought
that
this
was
high
enough
to
be
protected
from
any
swell
likely
to
arrive
in
such
a
sheltered
place
but
as
we
shall
see
scott
was
very
anxious
as
to
the
fate
of
the
hut
when
on
the
depôt
journey
a
swell
removed
not
only
miles
of
and
a
good
deal
of
barrier
but
also
the
end
of
glacier
tongue
we
never
saw
this
beach
again
for
the
autumn
gales
covered
it
with
thick
drifts
of
snow
and
the
thaw
was
never
enough
to
remove
this
for
the
two
other
summers
we
spent
here
there
is
no
doubt
this
was
an
exceptional
year
for
thaw
we
never
again
saw
a
little
waterfall
such
as
was
now
tumbling
down
the
rocks
from
skua
lake
into
the
sea
the
little
hill
of
feet
high
behind
us
was
soon
named
wind
vane
hill
and
there
were
other
meteorological
instruments
there
besides
a
or
always
forms
to
leeward
of
any
such
projection
and
that
beneath
this
hill
was
large
enough
for
us
to
drive
into
it
two
ice
caves
the
first
of
these
was
to
contain
our
larder
notably
the
frozen
mutton
carcasses
brought
down
by
us
from
new
zealand
in
the
on
deck
these
however
showed
signs
of
mildew
and
we
never
ate
very
freely
of
them
seal
and
penguin
were
our
stock
meat
foods
and
mutton
was
considered
to
be
a
luxury
the
second
cave
feet
long
by
feet
wide
hollowed
out
by
simpson
and
wright
was
for
the
magnetic
instruments
the
temperature
of
these
caves
was
found
to
be
fairly
constant
unfortunately
this
was
the
only
drift
into
which
we
could
tunnel
and
we
had
no
such
mass
of
snow
and
ice
as
is
afforded
by
the
barrier
which
can
be
burrowed
and
was
burrowed
extensively
by
amundsen
and
his
men
the
cases
containing
the
bulk
of
our
stores
were
placed
in
stacks
arranged
by
bowers
up
on
the
sloping
ground
to
the
west
of
the
hut
beginning
close
to
the
entrance
door
the
sledges
lay
on
the
hill
side
above
them
this
arrangement
was
very
satisfactory
during
the
first
winter
but
the
excessive
blizzards
of
the
second
winter
and
the
immense
amount
of
snow
which
was
gathering
about
the
camp
caused
us
to
move
everything
up
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
behind
the
hut
where
the
wind
kept
them
more
clear
amundsen
found
it
advisable
to
put
his
cases
in
two
long
lines
the
dogs
were
tethered
to
a
long
chain
or
rope
the
ponies
stable
was
built
against
the
northern
side
of
the
hut
and
was
thus
sheltered
from
the
blizzards
which
always
blow
here
from
the
south
against
the
south
side
of
the
hut
bowers
built
himself
a
every
day
he
conceives
or
carries
out
some
plan
to
benefit
the
camp
scott
seems
very
cheery
about
things
i
find
in
my
diary
about
this
time
and
well
he
might
be
a
man
could
hardly
be
better
served
we
slaved
until
we
were
nearly
and
then
we
found
something
else
to
do
until
we
were
quite
ship
company
and
landing
parties
alike
not
only
now
but
all
through
this
job
did
their
very
utmost
and
their
utmost
was
very
good
the
way
men
worked
was
fierce
if
you
can
picture
our
house
nestling
below
this
small
hill
on
a
long
stretch
of
black
sand
with
many
tons
of
provision
cases
ranged
in
neat
blocks
in
front
of
it
and
the
sea
lapping
the
below
you
will
have
some
idea
of
our
immediate
vicinity
as
for
our
wider
surroundings
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
their
beauty
in
sufficiently
glowing
terms
cape
evans
is
one
of
the
many
spurs
of
erebus
and
the
one
that
stands
closest
under
the
mountain
so
that
always
towering
above
us
we
have
the
grand
snowy
peak
with
its
smoking
summit
north
and
south
of
us
are
deep
bays
beyond
which
great
glaciers
come
rippling
over
the
lower
slopes
to
thrust
high
snouts
into
the
sea
the
sea
is
blue
before
us
dotted
with
shining
bergs
or
ice
floes
whilst
far
over
the
sound
yet
so
bold
and
magnificent
as
to
appear
near
stand
the
beautiful
western
mountains
with
their
numerous
lofty
peaks
their
deep
glacial
valley
and
clear
cut
scarps
a
vision
of
mountain
scenery
that
can
have
few
rivals
illustration
mt
erebus
the
ramp
and
the
hut
before
i
left
england
people
were
always
telling
me
the
antarctic
must
be
dull
without
much
life
now
we
are
in
ourselves
a
perfect
farmyard
there
are
nineteen
ponies
fifty
yards
off
and
thirty
dogs
just
behind
and
they
howl
like
the
wolves
they
are
at
intervals
led
by
dyk
the
skuas
are
nesting
all
round
and
fighting
over
the
remains
of
the
seals
which
we
have
killed
and
the
penguins
which
the
dogs
have
killed
whenever
they
have
got
the
chance
the
collie
bitch
which
we
have
brought
down
for
breeding
purposes
wanders
about
the
camp
a
penguin
is
standing
outside
my
tent
presumably
because
he
thinks
he
is
going
to
moult
here
a
seal
has
just
walked
up
into
the
horse
lines
there
are
plenty
of
weddell
and
penguins
and
whales
on
board
we
have
nigger
and
a
blue
persian
kitten
with
rabbits
and
squirrels
the
whole
place
teems
with
life
franky
drake
is
employed
all
day
wandering
round
for
ice
for
watering
the
ship
yesterday
he
had
made
a
pile
out
on
the
floe
and
the
men
wanted
to
have
a
flag
put
on
it
and
have
it
photographed
and
called
drake
furthest
south
january
was
fixed
as
the
day
upon
which
twelve
of
us
with
eight
ponies
and
the
two
were
to
start
south
to
lay
a
depôt
upon
the
barrier
for
the
polar
journey
scott
was
of
opinion
that
the
bays
between
us
and
the
hut
point
peninsula
would
freeze
over
in
march
probably
early
in
march
and
that
we
should
most
of
us
get
back
to
cape
evans
then
at
the
same
time
the
ponies
could
not
come
down
over
the
cliffs
of
this
tongue
of
land
and
preparations
had
to
be
made
for
a
lengthy
stay
at
hut
point
for
them
and
their
keepers
for
this
purpose
scott
meant
to
use
the
old
discovery
hut
at
hut
point
on
january
he
took
meares
and
one
and
started
for
hut
point
which
was
fifteen
statute
miles
to
the
south
of
us
they
crossed
glacier
tongue
finding
upon
it
a
depôt
of
compressed
fodder
and
maize
which
had
been
left
by
shackleton
the
open
water
to
the
west
nearly
reached
the
tongue
on
arrival
at
the
hut
scott
was
shocked
to
find
it
full
of
snow
and
ice
this
was
serious
and
as
we
found
afterwards
the
drifted
snow
had
thawed
down
into
ice
the
whole
of
the
inside
of
this
hut
was
a
big
ice
block
in
the
middle
of
this
ice
was
a
pile
of
cases
left
by
the
discovery
as
a
depôt
they
were
we
knew
full
of
biscuit
there
was
something
too
depressing
in
finding
the
old
hut
in
such
a
desolate
condition
i
had
had
so
much
interest
in
seeing
all
the
old
landmarks
and
the
huts
apparently
intact
to
camp
outside
and
feel
that
all
the
old
comforts
and
cheer
had
departed
was
dreadfully
heartrending
that
night
we
slept
badly
till
the
morning
and
therefore
late
after
breakfast
we
went
up
the
hills
there
was
a
keen
breeze
but
the
sun
shone
and
my
spirits
revived
there
was
very
much
less
snow
everywhere
than
i
had
ever
seen
the
ski
run
was
completely
cut
through
in
two
places
the
gap
and
observation
hill
almost
bare
a
great
bare
slope
on
the
side
of
arrival
heights
and
on
top
of
crater
heights
an
immense
bare
how
delighted
we
should
have
been
to
see
it
like
this
in
the
old
days
the
pond
was
thawed
and
the
confervae
green
in
fresh
water
the
hole
which
we
had
dug
in
the
mound
in
the
pond
was
still
there
as
meares
discovered
by
falling
into
it
up
to
his
waist
and
getting
very
wet
on
the
south
side
we
could
see
the
pressure
ridges
beyond
pram
point
as
of
old
horseshoe
bay
calm
and
unpressed
the
pressed
on
pram
point
and
along
the
gap
ice
front
and
a
new
ridge
running
around
armitage
about
miles
off
we
saw
ferrar
old
thermometer
tubes
standing
out
of
the
snow
slope
as
though
they
been
placed
yesterday
vince
cross
might
have
been
placed
yesterday
the
paint
was
so
fresh
and
the
inscription
so
legible
we
had
two
officers
who
had
been
with
shackleton
in
his
expedition
priestley
who
was
in
our
northern
party
and
day
who
was
in
charge
of
our
motors
priestley
with
two
others
sledged
over
to
cape
royds
and
has
left
an
account
of
the
old
hut
there
after
pitching
tent
levick
and
i
went
over
to
the
hut
to
forage
on
the
way
i
visited
derrick
point
and
took
a
large
tin
of
butter
while
levick
opened
up
the
hut
it
was
very
dark
inside
but
i
pulled
the
boarding
down
from
the
windows
so
that
we
could
see
all
right
it
was
very
funny
to
see
everything
lying
about
just
as
we
had
left
it
in
that
last
rush
to
get
off
in
the
lull
of
the
blizzard
on
marston
bunk
was
a
sixpenny
copy
of
the
story
of
bessie
costrell
which
some
one
had
evidently
read
and
left
open
perhaps
what
brought
the
old
times
back
again
more
than
anything
else
was
the
fact
that
as
i
came
out
of
the
larder
the
sleeve
of
my
wind
clothes
caught
the
tap
of
the
copper
and
turned
it
on
when
i
heard
the
drip
of
the
water
i
turned
instinctively
and
turned
the
tap
off
almost
expecting
to
hear
bobs
raucous
voice
cursing
me
for
my
clumsiness
perhaps
what
strikes
one
more
forcibly
than
anything
else
is
the
fact
that
nothing
has
been
disturbed
on
the
table
was
the
remains
of
a
batch
of
bread
that
bobs
had
cooked
for
us
and
that
was
only
partially
consumed
before
the
nimrod
called
for
us
some
of
the
rolls
showed
the
impression
of
bites
given
to
them
in
all
round
the
bread
were
the
sauces
pickles
pepper
and
salt
of
our
usual
standing
lunch
and
a
tin
of
gingerbreads
was
a
witness
to
the
dryness
of
the
climate
for
they
were
still
crisp
as
the
day
they
were
opened
in
the
cubicle
near
the
larder
were
the
loose
tins
that
poor
armytage
and
myself
had
collected
from
all
round
the
hut
before
we
left
on
the
shelves
of
my
cubicle
are
still
stacked
the
magazines
and
paper
brought
down
by
the
relief
ship
nothing
is
changed
at
all
except
the
company
it
is
almost
dismal
i
expect
to
see
people
come
in
through
the
door
after
a
walk
over
the
surrounding
hills
we
had
not
much
time
to
look
round
us
for
campbell
was
cooking
in
the
tent
so
we
slung
a
few
tins
of
jam
a
some
tea
and
gingerbreads
into
a
sack
and
returned
to
camp
by
this
time
it
was
snowing
heavily
and
continued
to
do
so
after
dinner
so
that
we
turned
in
immediately
and
went
off
to
sleep
one
thing
worth
mentioning
is
that
on
several
of
the
drifts
are
hoof
marks
some
of
them
looking
so
new
that
we
could
have
sworn
that
they
had
been
made
this
year
the
old
sport
levick
gave
us
a
start
by
suddenly
announcing
that
he
could
see
a
ship
quite
close
and
for
some
time
we
were
on
tenterhooks
but
his
ship
proved
to
be
the
terra
nova
off
the
skuary
the
whole
place
is
very
eerie
there
is
such
a
feeling
of
life
about
it
not
only
do
i
feel
it
but
the
others
do
also
last
night
after
i
turned
in
i
could
have
sworn
that
i
heard
people
shouting
to
each
other
i
thought
that
i
had
only
got
an
attack
of
nerves
but
campbell
asked
me
if
i
had
heard
any
shouting
for
he
had
certainly
done
so
it
must
have
been
the
seals
calling
to
each
other
but
it
certainly
did
sound
most
human
we
are
getting
so
worked
up
that
we
should
not
be
a
bit
surprised
to
see
a
settlement
of
japanese
or
some
other
such
people
some
day
when
we
stroll
round
towards
blacksand
beach
the
old
sport
created
some
amusement
this
evening
by
opening
a
tin
of
nestlé
milk
at
both
ends
instead
of
making
the
two
holes
at
one
end
he
informed
us
that
he
had
got
so
used
to
using
two
whole
tins
of
milk
for
cocoa
for
fourteen
people
at
night
that
he
always
opened
them
that
way
as
a
consequence
we
have
to
spend
most
of
our
spare
time
making
bungs
to
keep
the
milk
in
the
tin
meanwhile
as
was
to
be
expected
the
action
of
the
i
suspect
abnormal
summer
sea
temperature
was
showing
its
effect
upon
the
thaws
from
below
when
the
temperature
of
the
water
rises
the
northern
ice
goes
out
first
here
being
next
to
the
open
water
but
big
thaw
pools
form
at
the
same
time
wherever
a
current
of
water
flows
over
shallows
as
at
the
end
of
cape
evans
hut
point
and
cape
armitage
on
january
the
ice
was
breaking
away
between
the
point
of
cape
evans
and
the
ship
although
a
road
still
remained
fast
between
the
ship
and
the
shore
the
ship
began
to
get
up
steam
but
the
fast
ice
broke
away
quickly
that
night
i
believe
they
got
steam
in
three
hours
twelve
hours
being
the
time
generally
allowed
only
just
in
time
however
for
she
broke
adrift
as
it
was
reported
the
next
morning
she
made
fast
to
the
ice
only
yards
from
the
of
the
cape
for
the
present
the
position
is
extraordinarily
comfortable
with
a
southerly
blow
she
would
simply
bind
on
to
the
ice
receiving
great
shelter
from
the
end
of
the
cape
with
a
northerly
blow
she
might
turn
rather
close
to
the
shore
where
the
soundings
run
to
three
fathoms
but
behind
such
a
stretch
of
ice
she
could
scarcely
get
a
sea
or
swell
without
warning
it
looks
a
wonderfully
comfortable
little
nook
but
of
course
one
can
be
certain
of
nothing
in
this
place
one
knows
from
experience
how
deceptive
the
appearance
of
security
may
be
the
ship
difficulties
were
largely
due
to
the
shortage
of
coal
again
on
the
night
of
january
we
had
an
anxious
time
fearing
a
little
trouble
i
went
out
of
the
hut
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
saw
at
once
that
she
was
having
a
bad
time
the
ice
was
breaking
with
a
northerly
swell
and
the
wind
increasing
with
the
ship
on
dead
lee
shore
luckily
the
ice
anchors
had
been
put
well
in
on
the
floe
and
some
still
held
pennell
was
getting
up
steam
and
his
men
struggling
to
replace
the
anchors
we
got
out
the
men
and
gave
some
help
at
steam
was
up
and
i
was
right
glad
to
see
the
ship
back
out
to
windward
leaving
us
to
recover
anchors
and
hawsers
a
big
berg
drove
in
just
after
the
ship
had
got
away
and
grounded
where
she
had
been
lying
the
ship
returned
in
the
afternoon
and
it
seems
that
she
was
searching
round
for
an
anchorage
and
trying
to
look
behind
this
berg
there
was
a
strongish
northerly
wind
blowing
the
currents
and
soundings
round
cape
evans
were
then
unknown
the
current
was
setting
strongly
from
the
north
through
the
strip
of
sea
which
divides
inaccessible
island
from
cape
evans
a
distance
of
some
of
a
mile
the
engines
were
going
astern
but
the
current
and
wind
were
too
much
for
her
and
the
ship
ran
aground
being
fast
for
some
considerable
distance
aft
some
said
as
far
as
the
mainmast
visions
of
the
ship
failing
to
return
to
new
zealand
and
of
sixty
people
waiting
here
arose
in
my
mind
with
sickening
pertinacity
and
the
only
consolation
i
could
draw
from
such
imaginations
was
the
determination
that
the
southern
work
should
go
on
as
before
meanwhile
the
least
ill
possible
seemed
to
be
an
extensive
lightening
of
the
ship
with
boats
as
the
tide
was
evidently
high
when
she
struck
a
terribly
depressing
prospect
some
three
or
four
of
us
watched
it
gloomily
from
the
shore
whilst
all
was
bustle
on
board
the
men
shifting
cargo
aft
pennell
tells
me
they
shifted
tons
in
a
very
short
time
the
first
ray
of
hope
came
when
by
careful
watching
one
could
see
that
the
ship
was
turning
very
slowly
then
one
saw
the
men
running
from
side
to
side
and
knew
that
an
attempt
was
being
made
to
roll
her
off
the
rolling
produced
a
more
rapid
turning
movement
at
first
and
then
she
seemed
to
hang
again
but
only
for
a
short
time
the
engines
had
been
going
astern
all
the
time
and
presently
a
slight
movement
became
apparent
but
we
only
knew
she
was
getting
clear
when
we
heard
cheers
on
board
and
more
cheers
from
the
whaler
then
she
gathered
stern
way
and
was
clear
the
relief
was
enormous
all
this
took
some
time
and
scott
himself
came
back
into
the
hut
with
us
and
went
on
bagging
provisions
for
the
depôt
journey
at
such
times
of
real
disaster
he
was
a
very
philosophical
man
we
were
not
yet
ready
to
go
sledging
but
on
january
the
ice
in
north
bay
all
went
out
and
that
in
south
bay
began
to
follow
it
because
this
was
our
road
to
the
barrier
it
was
suddenly
decided
that
we
must
start
on
the
depôt
journey
the
following
day
or
perhaps
not
at
all
already
it
was
impossible
to
get
sledges
south
off
the
cape
but
there
was
a
way
to
walk
the
ponies
along
the
land
until
they
could
be
scrambled
down
a
steep
rubbly
slope
on
to
which
still
remained
would
it
float
away
before
we
got
there
it
was
touch
and
go
one
breathes
a
prayer
that
the
road
holds
for
the
few
remaining
hours
it
goes
in
one
place
between
a
berg
in
open
water
and
a
large
pool
of
the
glacier
face
it
may
be
weak
in
that
part
and
at
any
moment
the
narrow
isthmus
may
break
away
we
are
doing
it
on
a
very
narrow
margin

imaginative
friends
of
the
thirteen
men
who
started
from
cape
evans
on
january
may
have
thought
of
them
as
athletes
trained
for
some
weeks
or
months
to
endure
the
strains
which
they
were
to
face
sleeping
a
good
nine
hours
a
night
eating
carefully
regulated
meals
and
doing
an
allotted
task
each
day
under
scientific
control
they
would
be
far
from
the
mark
for
weeks
we
had
turned
in
at
midnight
too
tired
to
take
off
our
clothes
and
had
been
lucky
if
we
were
allowed
to
sleep
until
we
had
eaten
our
meals
when
we
could
and
we
had
worked
in
the
meantime
just
as
hard
as
it
was
physically
possible
to
do
if
we
sat
down
on
a
we
went
to
sleep
and
we
finally
left
the
camp
in
a
state
of
hurry
bordering
upon
panic
since
the
ice
to
the
south
of
us
the
road
to
the
barrier
was
being
nibbled
away
by
thaw
winds
and
tides
it
was
impossible
to
lead
the
ponies
down
from
the
cape
on
to
the
the
open
sea
was
before
us
and
on
our
right
front
it
was
necessary
to
lead
them
up
among
the
lava
blocks
which
lay
on
the
escarpment
of
erebus
towards
land
end
and
thence
to
slide
them
down
a
steep
but
rubbly
slope
to
the
ice
which
still
remained
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
ice
went
out
the
very
next
day
during
the
last
two
days
provisions
had
been
bagged
with
the
utmost
despatch
sledges
packed
letters
scribbled
clothing
sorted
and
rough
alterations
to
it
made
scott
was
busy
with
bowers
help
making
such
arrangements
as
could
be
suggested
for
a
further
year
stay
for
which
the
ship
was
to
order
the
necessaries
oates
was
busy
weighing
out
the
pony
food
for
the
journey
sorting
harness
and
generally
managing
a
most
unruly
mob
of
ponies
many
were
the
arguments
as
to
the
relative
value
of
a
pair
of
socks
or
their
equivalent
weight
in
tobacco
for
we
were
allowed
lbs
of
private
gear
apiece
to
consist
of
everything
which
we
did
not
habitually
wear
on
our
bodies
this
included
such
things
as
extra
pair
of
day
socks
a
shirt
tobacco
and
pipe
notebook
for
diary
and
pencil
extra
balaclava
helmet
extra
woollen
mitts
housewife
containing
buttons
needles
darning
needles
thread
and
wool
extra
pair
of
finnesko
big
with
which
to
hang
up
our
socks
and
perhaps
one
small
book
my
most
vivid
recollection
of
the
day
we
started
is
the
sight
of
bowers
out
of
breath
very
hot
and
in
great
pain
from
a
bad
knock
which
he
had
given
his
knee
against
a
rock
being
led
forward
by
his
big
pony
uncle
bill
over
whom
temporarily
he
had
but
little
control
he
had
been
left
behind
in
the
camp
giving
last
instructions
about
the
storage
of
cases
and
management
of
provisions
and
had
practically
lost
himself
in
trying
to
follow
us
over
what
was
then
unknown
ground
he
was
wearing
all
the
clothing
which
was
not
included
in
his
personal
gear
for
he
did
not
think
it
fair
to
give
the
pony
the
extra
weight
he
had
bruised
his
leg
in
an
ugly
way
and
for
many
days
he
came
to
me
to
bandage
it
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
let
the
doctors
see
it
they
would
forbid
him
to
go
forward
he
had
had
no
sleep
for
hours
that
first
night
january
we
pitched
our
inexperienced
camp
not
far
from
hut
point
but
our
first
taste
of
sledging
was
not
without
incident
starting
with
the
ponies
only
we
walked
them
to
glacier
tongue
where
the
ice
and
open
water
joined
and
as
we
went
we
watched
the
ship
pass
us
out
in
the
strait
and
moor
up
to
the
end
of
the
tongue
getting
the
ponies
across
the
tongue
with
its
shallow
but
numerous
crevasses
and
holes
was
ticklish
work
but
we
tethered
them
safely
off
the
terra
nova
which
meanwhile
was
landing
dogs
sledges
and
gear
then
we
got
some
lunch
on
board
a
large
lead
in
the
to
the
south
of
the
tongue
necessitated
some
hours
work
in
all
sledges
along
the
back
of
the
tongue
until
a
way
could
be
found
down
on
to
safe
ice
we
then
followed
with
the
ponies
if
a
pony
falls
into
one
of
these
holes
i
shall
sit
down
and
cry
said
oates
within
three
minutes
my
pony
was
wallowing
with
only
his
head
and
forelegs
visible
in
a
mess
of
brash
and
snow
which
had
concealed
a
crack
in
the
which
was
obviously
not
going
to
remain
much
longer
in
its
present
position
we
got
lashings
round
him
and
hauled
him
out
poor
guts
he
was
fated
to
drown
but
in
an
hour
he
appeared
to
have
forgotten
all
about
his
mishap
and
was
pulling
his
first
load
towards
hut
point
as
gallantly
as
always
the
next
day
we
took
further
stores
from
the
ship
to
the
camp
which
had
formed
some
of
these
loads
were
to
be
left
on
the
edge
of
the
barrier
when
we
got
there
but
for
the
present
we
had
to
relay
that
is
take
one
load
forward
and
come
back
for
another
on
the
we
sledged
back
to
the
ship
for
our
last
load
and
said
on
the
to
those
men
with
whom
we
had
already
worked
so
long
to
campbell
and
his
five
companions
who
were
to
suffer
so
much
to
cheery
pennell
and
his
ship
company
before
we
left
scott
thanked
pennell
and
his
men
for
their
splendid
work
they
have
behaved
like
bricks
and
a
finer
lot
of
men
never
sailed
in
a
ship
it
was
a
little
sad
to
say
farewell
to
all
these
good
fellows
and
campbell
and
his
men
i
do
most
heartily
trust
that
all
will
be
successful
in
their
ventures
for
indeed
their
unselfishness
and
their
generous
high
spirit
deserve
reward
god
bless
them
four
of
that
depôt
party
were
never
to
see
these
men
again
and
pennell
commander
of
the
queen
mary
went
down
with
his
ship
in
the
battle
of
jutland
two
days
later
january
we
sledged
our
first
loads
on
to
the
barrier
by
that
day
we
had
done
nearly
ninety
miles
of
relay
work
first
from
the
ship
at
glacier
tongue
to
our
camp
off
hut
point
and
then
onwards
those
first
days
of
sledging
were
wonderful
what
memories
they
must
have
brought
to
scott
and
wilson
when
to
us
who
had
never
seen
them
before
these
landmarks
were
almost
like
old
friends
as
we
made
our
way
over
the
frozen
sea
every
was
of
interest
and
every
type
of
snow
a
novelty
the
peak
of
terror
opened
out
behind
the
crater
of
erebus
and
we
walked
under
castle
rock
and
danger
slope
until
rounding
the
promontory
we
saw
the
little
jagged
hut
point
and
on
it
the
cross
placed
there
to
vince
memory
all
unchanged
there
was
the
old
discovery
hut
and
the
bay
in
which
the
discovery
lay
and
from
which
she
was
almost
miraculously
freed
at
the
last
moment
only
to
be
flung
upon
the
shoal
which
runs
out
from
the
point
where
some
tins
of
the
old
discovery
days
lie
on
the
bottom
still
and
glint
in
the
evening
sun
and
round
about
the
bay
were
the
heights
of
which
we
had
read
observation
hill
and
crater
hill
separated
from
it
by
the
gap
through
which
the
wind
was
streaming
of
course
it
was
for
this
must
be
the
famous
hut
point
wind
a
few
hundred
more
blizzards
had
swept
over
it
since
those
days
but
it
was
all
just
the
same
even
to
ferrar
little
stakes
placed
across
the
glacierets
to
mark
their
movement
more
even
to
the
footsteps
still
plainly
visible
on
the
slopes
the
ponies
were
dragging
up
to
lbs
each
these
days
and
though
they
did
not
seem
to
be
unduly
distressed
two
of
them
soon
showed
signs
of
lameness
this
caused
some
anxiety
but
the
trouble
was
mended
by
rest
on
the
whole
though
the
surface
was
hard
i
think
we
were
giving
them
too
much
weight
the
off
hut
point
and
observation
hill
was
already
very
dangerous
and
had
we
then
had
the
experience
and
knowledge
of
with
which
we
can
now
look
back
it
is
probable
that
we
should
not
have
slept
so
easily
upon
its
surface
parties
travelling
to
hut
point
and
beyond
in
summer
must
keep
well
out
from
the
point
and
cape
armitage
but
all
haste
was
being
made
to
transport
the
necessary
stores
on
to
the
barrier
surface
where
a
big
home
depôt
could
be
made
so
far
as
we
could
judge
in
safety
the
pressure
ridges
in
the
between
cape
armitage
and
pram
point
which
are
formed
by
the
movement
of
the
barrier
were
large
and
in
some
of
the
hollows
countless
seals
were
playing
in
the
water
judging
by
the
size
of
these
ridges
and
by
the
thickness
of
this
ice
when
it
broke
up
the
ice
south
of
hut
point
was
at
least
two
years
old
i
well
remember
the
day
we
took
the
first
of
our
loads
on
to
the
barrier
i
expect
we
were
all
a
little
excited
for
to
walk
upon
the
barrier
for
the
first
time
was
indeed
an
adventure
what
kind
of
surface
was
it
and
how
about
these
beastly
crevasses
of
which
we
had
read
so
much
scott
was
ahead
and
so
far
as
we
could
see
there
was
nothing
but
the
same
level
of
ice
all
round
when
suddenly
he
was
above
us
walking
up
the
sloping
and
quite
invisible
drift
a
minute
after
and
our
ponies
and
sledges
were
up
and
over
the
tide
crack
and
beneath
us
soft
and
yielding
snow
very
different
from
the
hard
surface
of
the
frozen
sea
which
we
had
just
left
really
it
was
rather
prosaic
and
a
tame
entrance
but
the
barrier
is
a
tricky
place
and
it
takes
years
to
get
to
know
her
on
our
outward
journey
this
day
oates
did
his
best
to
kill
a
seal
my
own
tent
was
promised
some
kidneys
if
we
were
good
and
our
mouths
watered
with
the
prospect
of
the
hoosh
before
us
the
seal
had
been
left
for
dead
and
when
on
our
homeward
way
we
neared
the
place
of
his
demise
titus
went
off
to
carve
our
dinner
from
him
the
next
thing
we
saw
was
the
seal
lolloping
straight
for
his
hole
while
oates
did
his
best
to
stab
him
the
quarry
made
off
safely
not
much
hurt
for
as
we
discovered
later
a
is
quite
useless
to
kill
a
seal
oates
returned
with
a
bad
cut
as
his
hand
had
slipped
down
the
knife
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
was
allowed
to
forget
it
this
barrier
which
we
were
to
know
so
well
was
soft
too
soft
for
the
ponies
and
apparently
flat
only
to
our
left
some
hundreds
of
yards
distant
there
were
two
little
snowy
mounds
we
got
out
the
telescope
which
we
carried
but
could
make
nothing
of
them
while
we
held
our
ponies
scott
walked
towards
them
and
soon
we
saw
him
brushing
away
snow
and
uncovering
something
dark
beneath
they
were
tents
obviously
left
by
shackleton
or
his
men
when
the
nimrod
was
embarking
his
southern
party
from
the
barrier
they
were
snowed
up
outside
and
iced
up
inside
almost
to
the
caps
afterwards
we
dug
them
out
a
good
evening
work
the
fabric
was
absolutely
rotten
we
just
tore
it
down
with
our
hands
but
the
bamboos
and
caps
were
as
sound
as
ever
when
we
had
dug
down
to
the
we
found
everything
intact
as
when
it
was
left
the
cooker
was
there
and
a
primus
scott
lighted
it
and
cooked
a
meal
we
often
used
it
afterwards
and
there
were
rowntree
cocoa
bovril
brand
extract
of
beef
sheep
tongues
cheese
and
biscuits
all
open
to
the
snow
and
all
quite
good
we
ate
them
for
several
days
there
is
something
impressive
in
these
first
meals
off
food
which
has
been
exposed
for
years
it
was
on
a
saturday
january
that
we
took
our
first
load
a
short
on
to
the
barrier
and
left
it
at
a
place
afterwards
known
as
the
fodder
depôt
two
days
later
we
moved
our
camp
mile
yards
farther
on
to
the
barrier
and
here
was
erected
the
main
depôt
known
as
safety
camp
because
it
was
supposed
that
even
if
a
phenomenal
of
should
occur
and
take
with
it
part
of
the
barrier
this
place
would
remain
subsequent
events
proved
the
supposition
well
founded
this
short
bit
of
barrier
sledging
gave
all
of
us
food
for
thought
for
the
surface
was
appallingly
soft
and
the
poor
ponies
were
sinking
deep
it
was
obvious
that
no
animals
could
last
long
under
such
conditions
but
somehow
shackleton
had
got
his
four
a
long
way
there
was
now
no
hurry
for
there
was
plenty
of
food
it
was
only
when
we
went
on
from
here
that
we
must
economize
food
and
travel
fast
it
was
determined
to
give
the
ponies
a
rest
while
we
made
the
depôt
and
rearranged
sledges
which
we
did
on
the
following
day
we
had
with
us
one
pair
of
pony
a
circle
of
wire
as
a
foundation
hooped
round
with
bamboo
and
with
beckets
of
the
same
material
the
surface
suggested
their
trial
which
was
completely
successful
the
question
of
had
been
long
and
anxiously
considered
and
shoes
for
all
the
ponies
were
at
cape
evans
but
as
we
had
so
lately
landed
from
the
ship
the
ponies
had
not
been
trained
in
their
use
and
they
had
not
been
brought
scott
immediately
sent
wilson
and
meares
with
a
to
see
whether
the
would
allow
them
to
reach
cape
evans
and
bring
back
shoes
for
the
other
ponies
meanwhile
the
next
morning
saw
us
trying
to
accustom
the
animals
to
wearing
by
exercising
them
in
the
one
pair
we
possessed
but
it
seemed
no
use
continuing
to
do
this
after
the
dog
party
came
in
they
had
found
the
gone
between
glacier
tongue
and
winter
quarters
and
so
were
they
reported
that
a
crevasse
at
the
edge
of
the
tongue
had
opened
under
the
sledge
which
had
tilted
back
into
the
crevasse
but
had
run
over
it
these
glacier
tongue
crevasses
are
shallow
things
gran
fell
into
one
later
and
walked
out
of
the
side
of
the
tongue
on
to
the
beyond
it
was
determined
to
start
on
the
following
day
with
five
provisions
for
men
and
animals
to
go
forward
for
about
fourteen
days
depôt
two
weeks
provisions
and
return
most
unfortunately
atkinson
would
have
to
be
left
behind
with
crean
to
look
after
him
he
had
chafed
his
foot
and
the
chafe
had
suppurated
to
his
great
disappointment
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
lie
up
luckily
we
had
another
tent
and
there
was
the
cooker
and
primus
we
had
dug
out
of
shackleton
tent
poor
crean
was
to
spend
his
spare
time
in
bringing
up
loads
from
the
fodder
depôt
to
safety
camp
and
worse
still
from
his
point
of
view
dig
a
hole
downwards
into
the
barrier
for
scientific
observations
we
left
the
following
morning
february
and
marched
on
a
patchy
surface
for
five
miles
camp
the
temperature
was
above
zero
and
scott
decided
to
see
whether
the
surface
was
not
better
at
night
on
the
whole
it
is
problematical
whether
this
is
the
case
we
came
to
the
conclusion
later
that
the
ideal
surface
for
pulling
a
sledge
on
ski
was
found
at
a
temperature
of
about
but
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
ponies
should
do
their
work
at
night
when
the
temperature
is
colder
and
rest
and
sleep
when
the
sun
has
its
greatest
altitude
and
power
and
so
we
camped
and
turned
in
to
our
at
and
marched
again
soon
after
midnight
doing
five
miles
before
and
five
miles
after
lunch
lunch
if
you
please
being
about
and
a
very
good
time
for
just
then
the
daylight
seemed
to
be
thin
and
bleak
and
one
always
felt
the
cold
our
road
lay
eastwards
through
the
strait
some
miles
in
width
which
runs
between
the
low
rather
uninteresting
scarp
of
white
island
to
the
south
and
the
beautiful
slopes
of
erebus
and
terror
to
the
north
this
part
of
the
barrier
is
stagnant
but
the
main
stream
in
front
of
us
unchecked
by
land
flows
uninterruptedly
northwards
towards
the
ross
sea
only
where
the
stream
presses
against
the
bluff
white
island
and
most
important
of
all
cape
crozier
and
rubs
itself
against
the
nearly
stationary
ice
upon
which
we
were
travelling
pressures
and
rendings
take
place
forming
some
nasty
crevasses
it
was
intended
to
steer
nearly
east
until
this
line
was
crossed
some
distance
north
of
white
island
and
then
steer
due
south
it
is
most
difficult
on
a
large
snow
surface
to
say
whether
it
is
flat
certainly
there
are
plenty
of
big
crevasses
for
several
miles
in
this
neighbourhood
though
they
are
generally
well
covered
and
we
found
only
very
small
ones
on
this
outward
journey
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
are
also
some
considerable
pressure
waves
as
we
came
up
to
camp
we
floundered
into
a
pocket
of
soft
snow
in
which
one
pony
after
another
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
until
they
were
buried
up
to
their
bellies
and
could
move
no
more
i
suppose
it
was
an
old
crevasse
filled
with
soft
snow
or
perhaps
one
of
the
hollows
which
had
been
recently
drifted
up
my
own
pony
somehow
got
through
with
his
sledge
to
the
other
side
and
every
moment
i
expected
the
ground
to
fall
below
us
and
a
chasm
to
swallow
us
up
the
others
had
to
be
unharnessed
and
led
out
the
only
set
of
was
then
put
on
to
bowers
big
pony
and
he
went
back
and
drew
the
stranded
sledges
out
beyond
we
pitched
our
camp
on
february
we
marched
for
ten
miles
to
camp
in
the
last
five
miles
we
crossed
several
crevasses
our
first
and
i
heard
oates
ask
some
one
what
they
looked
like
black
as
hell
he
said
but
we
saw
no
more
just
now
for
this
march
carried
us
beyond
the
line
of
pressure
which
runs
between
white
island
and
cape
crozier
this
halt
was
called
corner
camp
as
we
turned
here
and
marched
due
south
corner
camp
will
be
heard
of
again
and
again
in
this
story
it
is
thirty
miles
from
hut
point
by
it
was
blowing
our
first
barrier
blizzard
we
were
to
find
out
afterwards
that
a
corner
camp
blizzard
blows
nearly
as
often
as
a
hut
point
wind
the
bluff
seems
to
be
the
for
these
disturbances
which
pour
out
towards
the
sea
by
way
of
cape
crozier
corner
camp
is
in
the
direct
line
between
the
two
one
summer
blizzard
is
much
like
another
the
temperature
never
very
low
rises
and
you
are
not
cold
in
the
tent
sometimes
a
blizzard
is
a
very
welcome
rest
after
weeks
of
hard
pulling
dragging
yourself
awake
each
morning
feeling
as
though
you
had
only
just
gone
to
sleep
with
the
mental
strain
perhaps
which
work
among
crevasses
entails
it
is
most
pleasant
to
be
put
to
bed
for
two
or
three
days
you
may
sleep
dreamlessly
nearly
all
the
time
rousing
out
for
meals
or
waking
occasionally
to
hear
from
the
soft
warmth
of
your
reindeer
bag
the
deep
boom
of
the
tent
flapping
in
the
wind
or
drowsily
you
may
visit
other
parts
of
the
world
while
the
drifting
snow
purrs
against
the
green
tent
at
your
head
but
outside
there
is
raging
chaos
it
is
blowing
a
full
gale
the
air
is
full
of
falling
snow
and
the
wind
drives
this
along
and
adds
to
it
the
loose
snow
which
is
lying
on
the
surface
of
the
barrier
fight
your
way
a
few
steps
away
from
the
tent
and
it
will
be
gone
lose
your
sense
of
direction
and
there
is
nothing
to
guide
you
back
expose
your
face
and
hands
to
the
wind
and
they
will
very
soon
be
and
this
at
midsummer
imagine
the
added
cold
of
spring
and
autumn
the
cold
and
darkness
of
winter
the
animals
suffer
most
and
during
this
first
blizzard
all
our
ponies
were
weakened
and
two
of
them
became
practically
useless
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
had
stood
for
five
weeks
upon
a
heaving
deck
they
had
been
through
one
very
bad
gale
the
time
during
which
we
were
unloading
the
ship
was
limited
and
since
that
time
they
had
dragged
heavy
loads
the
greater
part
of
miles
nothing
was
left
undone
for
them
which
we
could
manage
but
necessarily
the
antarctic
is
a
grim
place
for
ponies
i
think
scott
felt
the
sufferings
of
the
ponies
more
than
the
animals
themselves
it
was
different
for
the
dogs
these
fairly
warm
blizzards
were
only
a
rest
for
them
snugly
curled
up
in
a
hole
in
the
snow
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
drifted
over
bieleglas
and
vaida
two
half
brothers
who
pulled
side
by
side
always
insisted
upon
sharing
one
hole
and
for
greater
warmth
one
would
lie
on
the
top
of
the
other
at
intervals
of
two
hours
or
so
they
fraternally
changed
places
this
blizzard
lasted
three
days
we
now
marched
nearly
due
south
the
open
barrier
in
front
mount
terror
and
the
sea
behind
for
five
days
covering
miles
when
being
now
level
with
the
southern
extremity
of
the
bluff
we
laid
the
bluff
depôt
the
bearings
of
bluff
depôt
as
well
as
those
of
corner
camp
are
given
in
scott
last
expedition
the
characteristics
of
these
days
were
the
collapse
of
two
of
the
ponies
blücher
and
blossom
and
the
partial
collapse
of
a
third
jimmy
pigg
although
the
surface
hardened
becoming
a
marbled
series
of
ridges
and
domes
in
this
region
for
the
rest
the
new
hands
were
finding
out
how
to
keep
warm
on
the
barrier
how
to
pitch
a
tent
and
cook
a
meal
in
twenty
minutes
and
the
thousand
and
one
little
tips
which
only
experience
can
teach
but
all
the
care
in
the
world
could
do
little
for
the
poor
ponies
it
must
be
confessed
at
once
that
some
of
these
ponies
were
very
poor
material
and
it
must
be
conceded
that
oates
who
was
in
charge
of
them
started
with
a
very
great
handicap
from
first
to
last
it
was
consummate
management
seconded
by
the
care
and
kindness
of
the
leaders
which
obtained
results
which
often
exceeded
the
most
sanguine
hopes
one
evening
we
watched
scott
digging
crumbly
blocks
of
snow
out
of
the
barrier
and
building
a
rough
wall
something
like
a
grouse
butt
to
the
south
of
his
pony
in
our
inmost
hearts
i
fear
we
viewed
these
proceedings
with
distrust
and
saw
in
it
but
little
usefulness
one
little
bit
of
leaky
wall
in
a
great
plain
of
snow
but
a
very
little
wind
which
you
must
understand
comes
almost
invariably
from
the
south
convinced
us
from
personal
experience
what
a
boon
these
walls
could
be
henceforward
every
night
on
camping
each
pony
leader
built
a
wall
behind
his
pony
while
his
pemmican
was
cooking
and
came
out
after
supper
to
finish
this
wall
before
he
turned
in
to
his
no
small
thing
when
you
consider
that
the
warmth
of
your
hours
of
rest
depends
largely
upon
getting
into
your
bag
immediately
you
have
eaten
your
hoosh
and
cocoa
and
not
seldom
you
might
hear
a
voice
in
your
dreams
bill
nobby
kicked
his
wall
down
and
out
bill
would
go
to
build
it
up
again

oates
wished
to
take
certain
of
the
ponies
as
far
south
as
possible
on
the
depôt
journey
and
then
to
kill
them
and
leave
the
meat
there
as
a
depôt
of
dog
food
for
the
polar
journey
scott
was
against
this
plan
here
at
bluff
depôt
he
decided
to
send
back
the
three
weakest
ponies
blossom
blücher
and
jimmy
pigg
with
their
leaders
lieutenant
evans
forde
and
keohane
they
started
back
the
next
morning
february
while
the
remainder
of
the
party
went
forward
over
a
surface
which
gradually
became
softer
as
we
left
behind
the
windy
region
of
the
bluff
we
now
had
with
us
the
two
teams
of
dogs
driven
by
meares
and
wilson

five
ponies

the
other
scott
was
evolving
in
his
mind
means
by
which
ponies
should
follow
one
another
in
a
string
the
second
pony
with
his
leading
rein
fastened
to
the
back
of
the
sledge
of
the
first
and
so
on
the
cavalcade
to
be
managed
by
two
or
three
men
only
instead
of
one
man
to
lead
each
pony
sunday
night
february
we
started
from
bluff
depôt
and
did
seven
miles
before
lunch
against
a
considerable
drift
and
wind
it
was
pretty
cold
and
ten
minutes
after
we
left
our
lunch
camp
with
the
ponies
it
was
blowing
a
full
blizzard
the
dog
party
had
not
started
so
we
camped
and
slept
five
in
the
tent
and
it
was
by
no
means
uncomfortable
probably
this
was
the
time
when
scott
first
thought
of
taking
a
party
to
the
pole
by
monday
evening
the
blizzard
was
over
the
dogs
came
up
and
we
did
miles
of
very
heavy
going
gran
pony
weary
willie
a
sluggish
and
obstinate
animal
was
far
behind
as
usual
when
we
halted
our
ponies
at
the
camping
place
farther
off
the
were
coming
up
what
happened
never
became
clear
poor
weary
it
seems
was
in
difficulties
in
a
the
dogs
of
one
team
being
very
hungry
took
charge
of
their
sledge
and
in
a
moment
were
on
the
horse
to
all
purposes
a
pack
of
ravenous
wolves
gran
and
weary
made
a
good
fight
and
the
dogs
were
driven
off
but
weary
came
into
camp
without
his
sledge
covered
with
blood
and
looking
very
sick
we
halted
after
doing
only
mile
more
after
lunch
for
the
pony
was
done
and
little
wonder
the
following
day
we
did
miles
with
difficulty
both
uncle
bill
and
weary
willie
going
very
slowly
and
stopping
frequently
the
going
was
very
deep
the
ponies
were
fast
giving
out
and
it
was
evident
that
we
had
much
to
learn
as
to
their
use
on
the
barrier
they
were
thin
and
very
hungry
their
rations
were
unsatisfactory
and
the
autumn
temperatures
and
winds
were
beyond
their
strength
we
went
on
one
more
day
in
a
minus
twenty
temperature
and
light
airs
and
then
in
latitude
it
was
determined
to
lay
the
depôt
which
was
afterwards
known
as
one
ton
and
return
in
view
of
subsequent
events
it
should
be
realized
that
this
depôt
was
just
a
cairn
of
snow
in
which
were
buried
food
and
oil
and
over
which
a
flag
waved
on
a
bamboo
there
is
no
land
visible
from
one
ton
except
on
a
very
clear
day
and
it
is
geographical
miles
from
hut
point
we
spent
a
day
making
up
the
mound
which
contained
about
a
ton
of
provisions
oil
compressed
fodder
oats
and
other
necessaries
for
the
forthcoming
polar
journey
scott
was
satisfied
with
the
result
and
indeed
this
depôt
ensured
that
we
could
start
southwards
for
the
pole
fully
laden
from
this
point
here
the
party
was
again
split
into
two
for
the
return
scott
was
anxious
to
get
such
news
about
the
landing
of
campbell
party
on
king
edward
vii
land
as
the
ship
should
have
left
at
hut
point
on
her
return
journey
he
decided
to
take
the
two
the
first
with
himself
and
meares
the
second
with
wilson
and
myself
and
make
a
quick
return
leaving
bowers
with
oates
and
gran
to
help
him
to
bring
back
the
five
ponies
driving
them
one
behind
the
other
the
return
of
the
pony
party
from
one
ton
depôt
a
letter
written
by
as
our
loads
were
so
light
titus
thought
it
would
be
better
for
the
ponies
to
do
their
full
march
in
one
stretch
and
so
have
a
longer
rest
we
therefore
decided
to
forgo
lunch
and
have
a
good
meal
on
camping
the
recent
trails
were
fresh
enough
to
follow
and
so
saved
us
steering
by
compass
which
is
very
difficult
as
the
needle
will
only
come
to
rest
after
you
have
been
standing
still
for
about
a
minute
that
march
was
extraordinary
the
snowy
mist
hid
all
distant
objects
and
made
all
close
ones
look
gigantic
although
we
were
walking
on
a
flat
undulating
plain
one
could
not
get
away
from
the
impression
that
the
ground
was
hilly
quite
steep
in
places
with
deep
hollows
by
the
wayside
suddenly
a
herd
of
apparent
cattle
would
appear
in
the
distance
then
you
would
think
it
a
team
of
dogs
broken
loose
and
rushing
towards
you
in
another
moment
one
would
be
walking
over
the
black
dots
of
some
old
horse
droppings
which
had
been
the
cause
of
the
hallucinations
since
then
i
have
often
been
completely
taken
in
by
appearances
under
certain
conditions
of
light
and
the
novelty
has
worn
off
sastrugi
are
the
hard
waves
formed
by
wind
on
a
snow
surface
these
are
seldom
more
than
a
foot
or
so
in
height
and
often
so
obscured
as
to
be
imperceptible
irregularities
on
this
occasion
they
often
appeared
like
immense
ridges
until
you
walked
over
them
after
going
about
miles
we
spotted
a
tiny
black
triangle
in
the
dead
white
void
ahead
it
was
over
a
mile
away
and
was
the
lunch
camp
of
the
dogs
we
were
fairly
close
before
they
broke
camp
and
hurriedly
packed
up
i
thought
they
looked
rather
sheepish
at
having
been
caught
up
like
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
again
still
we
had
been
marching
very
quickly
and
scott
was
delighted
to
see
weary
willie
going
so
well
they
then
dashed
off
and
after
completing
just
over
miles
we
reached
pagoda
cairn
where
a
bale
of
fodder
had
been
left
here
we
camped
and
threw
up
our
walls
as
quickly
as
possible
to
shelter
the
beasts
from
the
cold
wind
weary
was
the
most
annoying
he
would
deliberately
back
into
his
wall
and
knock
the
whole
structure
down
in
the
case
of
my
own
pony
i
had
to
put
the
wall
out
of
his
reach
as
his
aim
in
life
was
to
eat
it
generally
beginning
at
the
bottom
he
would
diligently
dislodge
a
block
and
bring
down
the
whole
fabric
one
can
not
be
angry
with
the
silly
beggars
titus
says
a
horse
has
practically
no
reasoning
power
the
thing
to
do
is
simply
to
throw
up
another
wall
and
keep
on
at
it
the
weather
cleared
during
the
night
and
the
next
day
february
we
started
off
under
ideal
conditions
the
sun
was
already
dipping
pretty
low
marks
easy
to
pick
up
and
on
this
occasion
we
could
plainly
see
a
cairn
over
seven
miles
away
raised
by
the
mirage
the
only
trouble
about
seeing
things
so
far
off
is
that
they
take
such
an
awful
time
to
reach
mirage
is
a
great
feature
down
here
and
one
of
the
most
common
of
optical
phenomena
on
the
barrier
it
is
often
difficult
to
persuade
oneself
that
open
water
does
not
lie
ahead
we
passed
the
scene
of
weary
fight
with
the
dogs
during
the
march
and
also
had
an
amusing
argument
as
to
a
dark
object
on
the
snow
ahead
at
first
we
thought
it
was
the
dog
camp
again
but
it
turned
out
to
be
an
empty
biscuit
tin
such
is
the
deceptive
nature
of
the
light
later
we
sighted
our
old
blizzard
camp
and
decided
to
utilize
the
walls
again
weary
willie
was
decidedly
worse
and
had
to
be
literally
jumped
along
by
the
pony
to
which
he
was
attached
within
half
a
mile
of
the
walls
weary
refused
to
go
farther
and
after
wasting
some
time
in
vain
efforts
to
urge
him
on
we
had
to
camp
where
we
were
having
only
done
miles
this
was
very
sad
but
i
took
hope
from
the
fact
that
titus
who
is
usually
pretty
pessimistic
had
not
yet
given
up
hopes
of
getting
him
back
alive
he
had
an
extra
whack
of
oats
at
the
expense
of
the
other
ponies
and
my
big
beast
made
up
for
his
shortage
by
hauling
the
sledge
towards
him
with
his
tethered
leg
and
forcing
his
nose
into
our
precious
biscuit
tank
out
of
which
he
helped
himself
liberally
at
our
expense
the
sledges
were
now
too
light
to
anchor
the
animals
so
we
had
to
peg
them
down
with
anything
we
could
and
bank
them
up
with
snow
weary
was
better
the
next
day
february
but
we
decided
at
the
outset
to
go
no
farther
than
the
bluff
camp
where
we
had
left
some
fodder
this
was
barely
miles
off
yet
my
old
animal
showed
signs
of
lassitude
before
the
end
there
was
nothing
alarming
however
and
we
saw
the
depôt
over
five
miles
off
which
interested
the
beasts
who
see
these
things
and
somehow
connect
them
in
the
backs
of
their
silly
old
heads
with
food
and
rest
weary
willie
made
a
decided
improvement
so
we
camped
in
high
spirits
captain
scott
had
asked
me
if
possible
to
take
some
theodolite
observations
for
the
determination
of
the
position
of
bluff
camp
ours
is
much
farther
off
and
farther
beyond
the
bluff
than
the
old
discovery
depôt
a
which
was
practically
the
same
position
shackleton
used
in
both
cases
scott
and
shackleton
were
keeping
nearer
the
coast
now
however
that
the
beardmore
has
been
discovered
we
can
aim
straight
for
that
which
takes
one
farther
east
by
at
least
miles
off
the
bluff
this
is
rather
an
advantage
i
think
as
close
in
to
this
remarkable
headland
the
onward
movement
of
the
barrier
arrested
by
the
immovable
hills
causes
a
terrific
chaos
of
crevasses
off
the
cliffs
at
the
end
these
extend
many
miles
and
include
some
chasms
big
enough
to
take
the
terra
nova
all
standing
needless
to
remark
one
is
well
clear
of
this
sort
of
scenery
with
ponies
hence
our
course
i
was
unable
to
get
any
observations
unfortunately
as
it
clouded
over
almost
at
once
and
later
in
the
day
started
to
snow
without
wind
this
often
happens
before
a
bliz
and
as
we
were
anxious
about
the
ponies
to
say
nothing
of
our
own
shortage
of
biscuit
we
felt
a
trifle
apprehensive
it
was
very
gloomy
when
we
left
camp
at
midnight
as
the
midnight
sun
was
already
cartwheeling
the
southern
horizon
the
first
sign
of
autumn
also
the
season
had
undoubtedly
broken
up
and
the
sky
was
covered
with
low
stratus
clouds
as
thick
as
a
hedge
we
lost
sight
of
the
cairn
almost
at
once
and
followed
the
remains
of
old
tracks
for
a
little
while
till
the
snowy
gloom
made
it
impossible
to
see
them
you
will
remember
that
it
was
at
the
bluff
camp
that
teddy
evans
returned
with
the
three
weak
ponies
so
there
were
plenty
of
traces
of
our
march
now
just
on
four
miles
from
the
start
i
saw
a
small
mound
some
distance
to
the
west
and
struck
over
there
it
was
a
small
cairn
without
the
signs
of
a
camp
and
rather
puzzled
me
at
the
time
as
i
shall
mention
it
later
i
will
call
it
x
for
convenience
we
then
pushed
on
and
i
found
steering
most
difficult
in
the
fuzzy
nothingness
ahead
one
could
see
no
point
on
which
to
fix
the
eye
and
the
compass
required
standing
still
to
look
at
it
every
time
our
sledging
compasses
are
spirit
ones
and
as
steady
as
a
small
hand
compass
could
possibly
be
you
will
understand
however
that
owing
to
the
proximity
of
the
magnetic
pole
the
pull
on
the
needle
is
chiefly
downwards
it
is
forced
into
a
horizontal
position
by
a
balancing
weight
on
the
side
so
it
is
obvious
that
its
direction
power
is
greatly
reduced
on
the
ship
owing
to
the
vibration
of
the
engines
and
the
motors
we
were
absolutely
unable
to
steer
by
the
compass
at
all
when
off
the
region
of
the
magnetic
pole
on
this
occasion
february
we
all
over
the
place
first
i
went
ahead
and
oates
said
i
then
he
went
ahead
and
i
understood
at
once
as
it
was
impossible
to
walk
straight
for
two
consecutive
minutes
however
we
plodded
along
with
frequent
stoppages
till
the
wind
came
away
and
then
having
determined
the
direction
of
that
steered
by
keeping
the
snow
on
our
backs
the
wind
was
not
strong
enough
to
be
unpleasant
and
all
was
well
we
legged
it
into
the
void
for
nearly
seven
miles
beyond
x
cairn
when
i
suddenly
found
myself
only
a
few
yards
away
from
another
cairn
this
shows
that
somehow
without
the
use
of
tracks
or
landmarks
we
had
marched
seven
miles
without
being
able
to
see
thirty
yards
and
had
yet
hit
off
the
direct
track
to
a
t
of
course
it
was
only
coincidence
though
some
people
might
credit
themselves
with
superlative
navigating
powers
on
such
evidence
the
wind
increased
and
with
the
knowledge
i
now
have
of
blizzards
i
would
camp
at
once
then
i
thought
it
better
to
shove
on
as
the
ponies
were
marching
splendidly
the
danger
lay
in
the
fact
that
though
it
is
easy
enough
for
you
to
march
with
the
wind
behind
you
ca
march
for
ever
and
you
will
probably
get
tired
before
the
wind
does
camping
in
a
stiff
breeze
is
always
difficult
to
say
nothing
of
a
gale
and
for
three
men
with
five
ponies
to
manage
would
be
wellnigh
impossible
fortunately
for
us
this
was
not
really
a
blizzard
though
it
was
quite
near
enough
to
one
the
sky
broke
later
and
showed
the
bluff
and
white
island
and
then
the
scurrying
clouds
of
drift
would
encircle
us
to
break
again
and
come
on
again
after
having
done
seventeen
miles
we
got
a
lull
and
stopped
to
camp
right
away
we
were
pretty
quick
about
it
and
fortunately
got
the
ponies
picketed
and
tent
pitched
before
the
wind
came
down
on
us
again
we
were
pretty
hungry
by
the
time
the
walls
were
erected
still
we
were
quite
happy
ate
everything
we
could
get
except
the
three
lumps
of
sugar
i
always
kept
for
old
uncle
bill
out
of
my
whack
the
little
blow
blew
itself
out
towards
evening
and
in
perfect
calm
and
sunshine
i
got
a
splendid
set
of
observations
erebus
and
terror
were
showing
up
as
clear
as
a
bell
and
i
got
a
large
number
of
angles
for
evans
survey
we
started
out
as
usual
and
had
the
most
pleasant
as
well
as
the
longest
of
our
return
marches
on
the
last
day
of
summer
february
we
did
eighteen
miles
right
off
the
reel
the
sun
was
brilliant
from
midnight
onwards
he
now
half
immersed
himself
below
the
horizon
for
a
short
interval
once
in
hours
all
old
cairns
were
visible
a
tremendous
distance
six
or
seven
miles
at
least
for
big
ones
mount
terror
lay
straight
ahead
and
looked
so
clear
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
imagine
it
miles
away
at
the
end
of
our
march
we
saw
a
small
cairn
beyond
our
outward
camp
mound
nobody
would
have
rigged
up
another
cairn
so
close
without
an
object
so
the
thought
of
a
dead
horse
flashed
through
my
mind
at
once
titus
was
so
sure
that
blücher
would
never
get
back
that
he
had
bet
gran
a
biscuit
on
it
i
saw
the
cairn
had
a
fodder
bale
on
the
top
and
later
saw
a
note
made
fast
to
the
wire
it
was
in
teddy
evans
handwriting
and
to
our
surprise
recorded
blossom
death
titus
was
so
sure
that
blossom
would
survive
blücher
that
we
started
to
think
back
and
thus
the
mystery
of
x
cairn
was
clear
to
me
i
was
quite
certain
now
that
both
the
ancient
ponies
had
died
and
that
jimmy
pigg
had
returned
alone
the
following
day
february
was
a
good
marching
day
also
but
a
bit
cloudy
latterly
we
did
fourteen
miles
as
this
evidence
of
pony
failure
made
us
all
the
more
anxious
about
ours
though
really
they
were
going
very
well
about
eight
miles
on
we
came
to
one
of
camps
and
the
solitary
pony
wall
told
its
own
tale
of
the
death
of
the
other
two
he
must
have
had
a
miserable
return
at
eleven
miles
there
were
two
bales
of
fodder
depôted
we
were
only
miles
odd
from
our
destination
off
cape
armitage
and
had
one
meal
over
three
days
food
if
therefore
we
could
average
miles
a
day
that
would
suffice
it
was
a
silly
risk
in
view
of
blizzards
and
other
possibilities
chiefly
our
own
inexperience
as
it
was
i
took
it
and
left
the
fodder
there
for
next
year
february
was
another
march
into
impenetrable
gloom
fortunately
corner
camp
though
dark
enough
was
not
shaded
in
mist
i
examined
it
for
notes
and
evidence
and
found
some
the
sun
set
properly
now
and
had
we
been
farther
from
home
i
should
have
changed
to
day
marching
i
have
seldom
seen
such
a
scene
of
utter
desolation
as
corner
camp
presented
on
that
gloomy
day
the
fog
then
settled
down
and
like
people
of
the
mist
we
struck
off
blindly
to
the
at
a
light
breeze
came
away
i
dreaded
a
blizzard
with
so
little
pony
food
and
already
regretted
my
folly
in
leaving
the
fodder
after
doing
twelve
miles
we
had
to
camp
as
it
was
impossible
even
to
march
straight
in
the
white
haze
we
made
five
colossal
walls
and
turned
in
hoping
for
the
best
fortune
favours
the
reckless
as
well
as
the
brave
at
times
and
it
did
this
time
as
the
blizzard
still
held
off
the
signs
of
one
impending
were
unmistakable
notwithstanding
weary
willie
did
less
well
on
february
and
as
the
surface
became
heavier
we
had
to
camp
after
only
doing
eleven
miles
i
thought
best
in
view
of
the
threatening
appearance
of
the
weather
to
have
a
six
hours
rest
and
march
into
safety
camp
the
same
day
a
distance
of
eight
miles
we
found
to
our
horror
that
gran
had
dropped
the
top
cap
of
our
primus
at
the
last
camp
cold
food
stared
us
in
face
however
we
did
manage
to
melt
some
snow
for
a
cheering
drink
by
cutting
a
piece
of
tin
as
near
the
shape
of
the
cap
as
possible
our
biscuit
was
finished
owing
to
the
ravages
of
my
pony
before
turning
in
i
saw
some
specks
to
the
and
skipping
my
theodolite
on
its
tripod
looked
through
the
telescope
and
saw
two
tents
and
a
number
of
ski
stuck
up
this
was
scott
party
together
with
jimmy
pigg
going
out
to
corner
camp
this
we
concluded
was
either
a
or
man
and
beast
party
bound
for
corner
camp
we
overslept
and
so
did
not
get
away
till
the
afternoon
it
was
still
very
cloudy
and
threatening
i
found
that
i
had
steered
considerably
to
the
southward
of
the
right
direction
in
the
fog
and
it
is
lucky
we
met
with
no
crevasses
off
white
island
safety
camp
at
last
appeared
and
the
last
four
miles
seemed
interminable
we
had
given
the
animals
their
last
feed
before
starting
not
a
particle
remained
but
they
stuck
it
the
surface
was
very
heavy
once
however
that
they
had
seen
the
camp
they
never
stopped
i
suppose
they
knew
they
were
nearly
home
we
marched
in
about
i
said
god
when
i
looked
at
the
weather
and
the
empty
sledges
the
dogs
were
in
camp
also
the
dome
tent
we
had
some
tents
shaped
like
a
dome
in
addition
to
those
we
used
for
sledging
out
of
which
uncle
bill
the
real
bill
wilson
and
meares
emerged
we
soon
had
the
ponies
behind
walls
and
well
fed
borrowed
their
primus
for
ourselves
and
had
a
square
meal
of
pemmican
and
biscuit
with
fids
of
seal
liver
in
it
end
of
bowers
account
the
return
of
the
dog
party
the
history
of
the
was
eventful
we
travelled
fast
doing
nearly
miles
in
the
first
three
days
by
which
time
we
were
approaching
corner
camp
the
dogs
were
thin
and
hungry
and
we
were
pushing
them
each
day
just
so
long
as
they
could
pull
running
ourselves
for
the
most
part
scott
determined
to
cut
the
corner
that
is
to
miss
corner
camp
and
cut
diagonally
across
our
outward
track
it
was
not
expected
that
this
would
bring
us
across
any
badly
crevassed
area
we
started
on
the
evening
of
february
in
a
very
bad
light
it
was
coldish
with
no
wind
after
going
about
three
miles
i
saw
a
drop
in
the
level
of
the
barrier
which
the
sledge
was
just
going
to
run
over
i
shouted
to
wilson
to
look
out
but
he
had
already
jumped
on
to
the
sledge
for
he
was
running
having
seen
stareek
put
his
paws
through
it
was
a
nasty
crevasse
about
twenty
feet
across
with
blue
holes
on
both
sides
the
sledge
ran
over
and
immediately
on
the
opposite
side
was
brought
up
by
a
large
of
pressure
which
we
had
not
seen
owing
to
the
light
meares
team
on
our
left
never
saw
any
sign
of
pressure
the
light
was
so
bad
that
we
never
saw
this
cairn
of
ice
until
we
ran
into
it
we
ran
level
for
another
two
miles
meares
and
scott
on
our
left
we
were
evidently
crossing
many
crevasses
quite
suddenly
we
saw
the
dogs
of
their
team
disappearing
following
one
another
just
like
dogs
going
down
a
hole
after
some
animal
in
a
moment
wrote
scott
the
whole
team
were
sinking
two
by
two
we
lost
sight
of
them
each
pair
struggling
for
foothold
osman
the
leader
exerted
all
his
strength
and
kept
a
foothold
it
was
wonderful
to
see
him
the
sledge
stopped
and
we
leapt
aside
the
situation
was
clear
in
another
moment
we
had
been
actually
travelling
along
the
bridge
or
snow
covering
of
a
crevasse
the
sledge
had
stopped
on
it
whilst
the
dogs
hung
in
their
harness
in
the
abyss
suspended
between
the
sledge
and
the
leading
dog
why
the
sledge
and
ourselves
did
follow
the
dogs
we
shall
never
know
we
of
the
other
sledge
stopped
hurriedly
tethered
our
team
and
went
to
their
assistance
with
the
alpine
rope
osman
the
big
leader
was
in
great
difficulties
he
crouched
resisting
with
all
his
enormous
strength
the
pull
of
the
rope
upon
which
the
team
hung
in
their
harness
in
mid
air
it
was
clear
that
if
osman
gave
way
the
sledge
and
dogs
would
probably
all
be
lost
down
the
crevasse
first
we
pulled
the
sledge
off
the
crevasse
and
drove
the
tethering
peg
and
driving
stick
through
the
cross
pieces
to
hold
it
firm
scott
and
meares
then
tried
to
pull
up
the
rope
from
osman
end
while
we
hung
on
to
the
sledge
to
prevent
it
slipping
down
the
crevasse
they
could
not
move
it
an
inch
we
then
put
the
strain
as
much
as
possible
on
to
a
peg
meanwhile
two
dogs
had
fallen
out
of
their
harness
into
the
crevasse
and
could
be
seen
lying
on
a
some
feet
down
later
they
curled
up
and
went
to
sleep
another
dog
as
he
hung
managed
to
get
some
purchase
for
his
feet
on
the
side
of
the
crevasse
and
a
free
fight
took
place
among
several
more
of
them
as
they
dangled
those
that
hung
highest
using
the
backs
of
those
under
them
to
get
a
purchase
it
takes
one
a
little
time
wrote
scott
to
make
plans
under
such
sudden
circumstances
and
for
some
minutes
our
efforts
were
rather
futile
we
could
not
get
an
inch
on
the
main
trace
of
the
sledge
or
on
the
leading
rope
which
was
binding
osman
to
the
snow
with
a
throttling
pressure
then
thought
became
clearer
we
unloaded
our
sledge
putting
in
safety
our
with
the
tent
and
cooker
choking
sounds
from
osman
made
it
clear
that
the
pressure
on
him
must
soon
be
relieved
i
seized
the
lashing
off
meares
passed
the
tent
poles
across
the
crevasse
and
with
meares
managed
to
get
a
few
inches
on
the
leading
line
this
freed
osman
whose
harness
was
immediately
cut
then
securing
the
alpine
rope
to
the
main
trace
we
tried
to
haul
up
together
one
dog
came
up
and
was
unlashed
but
by
this
time
the
rope
had
cut
so
far
back
at
the
edge
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
get
more
of
it
but
we
could
now
unbend
the
sledge
and
do
that
for
which
we
should
have
aimed
from
the
first
namely
run
the
sledge
across
the
gap
and
work
from
it
we
managed
to
do
this
our
fingers
constantly
numbed
wilson
held
on
to
the
anchored
trace
whilst
the
rest
of
us
laboured
at
the
leader
end
the
leading
rope
was
very
small
and
i
was
fearful
of
its
breaking
so
meares
was
lowered
down
a
foot
or
two
to
secure
the
alpine
rope
to
the
leading
end
of
the
trace
this
done
the
work
of
rescue
proceeded
in
better
order
two
by
two
we
hauled
the
animals
up
to
the
sledge
and
one
by
one
cut
them
out
of
their
harness
strangely
the
last
dogs
were
the
most
difficult
as
they
were
close
under
the
lip
of
the
gap
bound
in
by
the
rope
finally
with
a
gasp
we
got
the
last
poor
creature
on
to
firm
snow
we
had
recovered
eleven
of
the
thirteen
the
dogs
had
been
dangling
for
over
an
hour
and
some
of
them
showed
signs
of
internal
injuries
meanwhile
the
two
remaining
dogs
were
lying
down
the
crevasse
on
a
scott
proposed
going
down
on
the
alpine
rope
to
get
them
all
his
instincts
of
kindness
were
aroused
as
well
as
the
thought
of
the
loss
of
two
of
the
team
wilson
thought
it
was
a
mad
idea
and
very
dangerous
and
said
so
asking
however
whether
he
might
not
go
down
instead
of
scott
if
anybody
had
to
go
scott
insisted
and
we
paid
down
the
alpine
rope
to
test
the
distance
the
ledge
was
about
feet
below
we
lowered
scott
who
stood
on
the
ledge
while
we
hauled
up
the
two
dogs
in
turn
they
were
glad
to
see
him
and
little
wonder
but
the
rescued
dogs
which
were
necessarily
running
about
loose
on
the
barrier
in
their
mangled
harnesses
chose
this
moment
to
start
a
free
fight
with
the
other
team
with
a
hurried
shout
down
the
crevasse
we
had
to
rush
off
to
separate
them
nougis
had
been
considerably
mauled
before
this
was
done
also
incidentally
my
heel
but
at
last
we
separated
them
and
hauled
scott
to
the
surface
it
was
all
three
of
us
could
do
and
our
fingers
were
towards
the
end
scott
interest
in
the
incident
apart
from
the
recovery
of
the
dogs
was
scientific
since
we
were
running
across
the
line
of
cleavage
when
the
dogs
went
down
it
was
to
be
expected
that
we
should
be
crossing
the
crevasses
at
right
angles
and
not
be
travelling
as
actually
happened
parallel
to
or
along
them
while
we
were
getting
him
up
the
sixty
odd
feet
to
which
we
had
lowered
him
he
kept
muttering
i
wonder
why
this
is
running
the
way
it
is
you
expect
to
find
them
at
right
angles
and
when
down
the
crevasse
he
wanted
to
go
off
exploring
but
we
managed
to
persuade
him
that
the
upon
which
he
was
standing
was
utterly
unsafe
and
indeed
we
could
see
the
nothingness
below
through
the
blue
holes
in
the
shelf
another
regret
was
that
we
had
no
thermometer
the
temperature
of
the
inside
of
the
barrier
is
of
great
interest
and
a
fairly
reliable
record
of
the
average
temperature
throughout
the
year
might
have
been
obtained
when
so
far
down
into
it
altogether
we
could
congratulate
ourselves
on
a
fortunate
ending
to
a
nasty
business
we
expected
several
more
miles
of
crevasses
and
the
wind
was
getting
up
driving
the
surface
drift
like
smoke
over
the
ground
with
a
very
black
sky
to
the
south
we
pitched
the
tent
had
a
good
meal
and
mended
the
dog
harness
which
had
been
ruthlessly
cut
in
clearing
the
dogs
luckily
we
found
no
more
crevasses
for
it
was
now
blowing
hard
and
rescue
work
would
have
been
difficult
and
we
pushed
on
as
far
as
possible
that
night
doing
eleven
miles
after
lunch
and
sixteen
for
the
day
it
had
been
strenuous
for
we
had
been
working
in
or
over
the
crevasse
for
hours
and
dogs
and
men
were
tired
out
it
cleared
and
became
quite
warm
as
we
camped
there
was
a
pleasant
air
of
friendship
in
the
tent
that
night
rather
more
than
usual
that
is
generally
the
result
of
this
kind
of
business
we
reached
safety
camp
next
day
february
anxious
for
news
of
the
ship
doings
the
landing
of
campbell
party
and
of
the
ponies
which
had
been
sent
back
from
the
bluff
depôt
lieutenant
evans
forde
and
keohane
the
pony
leaders
were
there
but
only
one
pony
the
other
two
had
died
of
exhaustion
soon
after
they
left
us
and
we
had
passed
the
cairns
which
marked
their
graves
without
knowledge
their
story
was
grim
and
they
had
had
a
mournful
journey
back
first
blossom
and
then
blücher
collapsed
their
ends
being
hastened
by
the
blizzard
of
february
this
crevasse
incident
followed
by
the
news
of
the
loss
of
the
ponies
was
a
blow
to
scott
and
his
mind
was
also
uneasy
about
atkinson
and
crean
whom
we
had
left
here
and
who
had
disappeared
leaving
no
record
nor
was
the
report
from
the
terra
nova
here
so
we
judged
that
the
missing
men
and
the
report
must
be
at
hut
point
after
three
or
four
hours
sleep
and
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
biscuit
we
started
with
cooker
and
the
former
because
we
were
to
have
our
good
meal
at
the
hut
the
latter
in
case
we
were
hung
up
travelling
over
the
as
far
as
the
gap
from
which
we
saw
that
the
open
sea
reached
to
hut
point
we
made
our
way
into
the
hut
and
there
was
a
mystery
the
accumulations
of
ice
which
we
found
in
it
were
dug
away
there
was
a
notice
outside
dated
february
saying
mail
for
captain
scott
is
in
bag
inside
south
door
we
hunted
everywhere
but
there
was
no
atkinson
nor
crean
nor
mail
nor
the
things
which
the
ship
was
to
have
brought
all
kinds
of
wild
theories
were
advanced
by
the
presence
of
a
fresh
onion
and
some
bread
it
was
clear
that
the
ship
party
had
been
there
but
the
rest
was
utterly
vague
it
was
then
suggested
that
we
were
expected
back
about
this
time
and
that
the
missing
men
had
been
sledging
to
safety
camp
round
cape
armitage
on
the
very
shaky
while
we
passed
them
as
we
came
through
the
gap
sledge
tracks
were
found
leading
on
to
the
we
started
back
in
doubt
scott
was
terribly
anxious
we
were
all
tired
and
the
depôt
never
seemed
to
come
nearer
it
was
not
until
we
were
some
two
hundred
yards
from
it
that
we
saw
the
extra
tent
thank
god
i
heard
scott
mutter
under
his
breath
and
i
believe
you
were
even
more
anxious
than
i
was
bill
atkinson
had
the
ship
mail
signed
by
campbell
every
incident
of
the
day
scott
wrote
pales
before
the
startling
contents
of
the
which
atkinson
gave
me
a
letter
from
campbell
setting
out
his
doings
and
the
finding
of
amundsen
established
in
the
bay
of
whales
illustration
hut
point
wilson
del
strongly
as
scott
tries
to
word
this
it
quite
fails
to
convey
how
he
felt
and
how
we
all
felt
more
or
less
in
spite
of
the
warning
conveyed
in
the
telegram
from
madeira
to
melbourne
for
an
hour
or
so
we
were
furiously
angry
and
were
possessed
with
an
insane
sense
that
we
must
go
straight
to
the
bay
of
whales
and
have
it
out
with
amundsen
and
his
men
in
some
undefined
fashion
or
other
there
and
then
such
a
mood
could
not
and
did
not
bear
a
moment
reflection
but
it
was
natural
enough
we
had
just
paid
the
first
instalment
of
the
labour
of
making
a
path
to
the
pole
and
we
felt
however
unreasonably
that
we
had
earned
the
first
right
of
way
our
sense
of
and
solidarity
had
been
wrought
up
to
an
extraordinary
pitch
and
we
had
so
completely
forgotten
the
spirit
of
competition
that
its
sudden
intrusion
jarred
frightfully
i
do
not
defend
our
burst
of
rage
for
such
it
was
i
simply
record
it
as
an
integral
human
part
of
my
narrative
it
passed
harmlessly
and
account
proceeds
as
follows
one
thing
only
fixes
itself
definitely
in
my
mind
the
proper
as
well
as
the
wiser
course
for
us
is
to
proceed
exactly
as
though
this
had
not
happened
to
go
forward
and
do
our
best
for
the
honour
of
the
country
without
fear
or
panic
there
is
no
doubt
that
amundsen
plan
is
a
very
serious
menace
to
ours
he
has
a
shorter
distance
to
the
pole
by
miles
i
never
thought
he
could
have
got
so
many
dogs
safely
to
the
ice
his
plan
of
running
them
seems
excellent
but
above
and
beyond
all
he
can
start
his
journey
early
in
the
season
an
impossible
condition
with
ponies
we
read
that
on
leaving
mcmurdo
sound
the
terra
nova
coasted
eastward
along
the
barrier
face
with
campbell
and
his
men
who
were
to
be
landed
on
king
edward
vii
land
if
possible
she
surveyed
the
face
of
the
barrier
as
she
went
from
cape
crozier
to
longitude
whence
she
shaped
a
course
direct
for
cape
colbeck
which
priestley
states
in
his
diary
is
only
feet
high
according
to
our
measurement
and
looks
uncommonly
like
common
or
garden
barrier
here
they
met
heavy
pack
and
were
forced
to
return
without
finding
any
place
where
the
cliff
was
low
enough
to
allow
campbell
and
his
five
men
to
land
they
coasted
back
making
for
an
inlet
known
as
balloon
bight
priestley
tells
the
story
february
our
trip
has
not
been
without
outcome
after
all
and
all
our
doubts
about
wintering
here
or
in
south
victoria
land
have
been
settled
in
a
startling
fashion
about
ten
we
steamed
into
a
deep
bay
in
the
barrier
which
proved
to
be
shackleton
bay
of
whales
and
our
observations
in
the
last
expedition
shackleton
have
been
wonderfully
upheld
our
present
sights
and
angles
pennell
tells
me
are
almost
a
duplicate
of
those
that
we
got
every
one
has
always
been
doubtful
about
the
bay
of
whales
we
reported
but
now
the
matter
has
been
set
at
rest
finally
there
is
no
doubt
now
that
balloon
bight
and
the
neighbouring
bay
marked
on
the
discovery
chart
have
become
merged
into
one
and
further
that
since
that
period
the
resulting
bight
has
broken
back
considerably
more
indeed
it
seems
to
have
altered
a
good
deal
on
its
western
border
since
our
visit
to
it
in
otherwise
it
is
the
same
the
same
deceptive
caves
and
shadows
having
from
a
distance
the
appearance
of
rock
exposures
the
same
cliffs
the
same
undulations
behind
the
same
expanse
of
and
even
the
same
crowds
of
whales
i
hope
that
before
we
leave
we
shall
find
it
possible
to
survey
the
bight
but
that
depends
on
the
weather
it
was
satisfactory
to
find
all
our
observations
coming
right
and
everybody
backing
up
shackleton
and
i
turned
in
last
night
feeling
quite
cheerful
and
believing
that
there
would
be
a
really
good
chance
of
the
eastern
party
finding
a
home
on
the
barrier
here
our
last
chance
of
surveying
king
edward
land
however
man
proposes
but
god
disposes
and
i
was
waked
up
by
lillie
at
one
this
morning
by
the
astounding
news
that
there
was
a
ship
in
the
bay
at
anchor
to
the
all
was
confusion
on
board
for
a
few
minutes
everybody
rushing
up
on
deck
with
cameras
and
clothes
it
was
no
false
alarm
there
she
was
within
a
few
yards
of
us
and
what
is
more
those
of
us
who
had
read
nansen
books
recognized
the
fram
she
is
rigged
with
fore
and
aft
sails
and
as
she
has
petrol
engines
she
has
no
funnel
soon
afterwards
the
men
forward
declared
that
they
sighted
a
hut
on
the
barrier
and
the
more
excited
declared
that
there
was
a
party
coming
out
to
meet
us
campbell
levick
and
myself
were
therefore
lowered
over
the
side
of
the
ship
while
she
was
being
made
fast
and
set
off
on
ski
towards
the
dark
spot
we
could
see
this
proved
to
be
only
an
abandoned
depôt
and
we
returned
to
the
ship
where
campbell
who
in
his
anxiety
to
be
the
first
to
meet
them
had
left
us
beginners
far
behind
had
opened
up
conversation
with
the
night
watchman
he
informed
us
that
there
were
only
three
men
on
board
and
that
the
remainder
of
them
were
settling
amundsen
in
winter
quarters
about
as
far
from
the
depôt
as
the
depôt
was
from
the
ship
amundsen
is
coming
to
visit
the
fram
and
we
are
staying
long
enough
to
allow
pennell
and
campbell
to
interview
him
they
reached
the
pack
about
january
and
were
through
it
by
the
so
they
did
not
have
as
bad
a
time
as
we
did
they
inform
us
that
amundsen
does
not
intend
to
make
his
descent
on
the
pole
until
next
year
this
is
encouraging
as
it
means
a
fair
race
for
the
next
summer
though
the
news
we
are
bringing
to
them
will
keep
the
western
main
party
on
tenterhooks
of
excitement
all
the
winter
our
plans
have
of
course
been
decided
for
us
we
can
not
according
to
etiquette
trench
on
their
winter
quarters
but
must
return
to
mcmurdo
sound
and
then
go
off
towards
robertson
bay
and
settle
ourselves
as
best
we
can
while
we
are
waiting
events
we
have
not
been
by
any
means
idle
rennick
got
a
sounding
fathoms
and
the
crew
have
killed
three
seals
including
one
beautiful
silver
lillie
has
secured
water
samples
at
and
fathoms
and
has
had
a
haul
with
the
plankton
net
and
williams
is
endeavouring
to
fit
up
the
trawl
for
a
haul
if
we
get
time
and
appropriate
weather
i
got
a
roll
of
films
and
gave
the
roll
to
drake
to
take
home
and
get
developed
in
christchurch
there
are
photographs
of
the
fram
of
the
fram
and
terra
nova
together
of
their
depôt
and
of
the
and
the
which
is
decidedly
overcut
the
thick
snow
having
been
removed
in
places
by
the
swell
until
a
ledge
several
yards
wide
is
lying
just
submerged
it
has
been
calm
all
the
night
with
the
snow
falling
at
intervals
february
i
was
waked
at
seven
this
morning
by
levick
demanding
the
loan
of
my
camera
it
appears
that
amundsen
johansen
and
six
men
had
arrived
at
the
fram
this
morning
at
about
and
had
come
over
to
interview
campbell
and
pennell
campbell
pennell
and
levick
then
went
back
to
breakfast
with
them
and
stayed
until
nearly
noon
when
they
returned
telling
us
to
expect
amundsen
nilsen
the
first
lieutenant
of
the
fram
who
is
taking
her
back
after
landing
the
party
and
a
young
lieutenant
whose
name
none
of
us
caught
to
lunch
after
lunch
a
party
of
officers
and
men
went
to
see
the
rest
of
the
norwegians
see
over
the
ship
and
say
i
did
not
go
and
was
able
to
show
lieut
jensen
over
the
ship
in
the
meantime
about
three
we
let
go
the
ice
anchor
and
parted
from
the
fram
steaming
along
the
ice
very
slowly
in
order
to
dredge
from
to
fathoms
the
haul
was
successful
about
two
bucketsful
of
the
muddy
bottom
being
secured
and
a
still
more
valuable
catch
from
the
biological
point
of
view
were
two
long
crinoids
about
a
couple
of
feet
in
length
and
in
fairly
perfect
condition
which
had
become
attached
to
the
outside
of
the
net
we
are
now
standing
along
the
barrier
continuing
our
survey
to
the
bight
we
first
struck
after
which
we
sail
to
cape
evans
stay
a
day
there
and
then
make
up
north
to
try
and
effect
a
lodgment
on
the
coast
beyond
cape
adare
during
the
morning
browning
and
i
examined
the
forming
the
eastern
face
of
the
bight
we
found
it
to
be
made
of
clear
ice
of
grain
from
a
quarter
to
of
an
inch
in
size
and
full
of
bubbles
on
the
way
there
i
took
a
couple
of
photographs
of
some
of
dogs
and
when
we
were
there
i
got
a
few
of
crevasses
and
caves
in
the
barrier
face
well
we
have
left
the
norwegians
and
our
thoughts
are
full
too
full
of
them
at
present
the
impression
they
have
left
with
me
is
that
of
a
set
of
men
of
distinctive
personality
hard
and
evidently
inured
to
hardship
good
goers
and
pleasant
and
all
these
qualities
combine
to
make
them
very
dangerous
rivals
but
even
did
one
want
not
to
one
can
not
help
liking
them
individually
in
spite
of
the
rivalry
one
thing
i
have
particularly
noticed
is
the
way
in
which
they
are
refraining
from
getting
information
from
us
which
might
be
useful
to
them
we
have
news
which
will
make
the
western
party
as
uneasy
as
ourselves
and
the
world
will
watch
with
interest
a
race
for
the
pole
next
year
a
race
which
may
go
any
way
and
may
be
decided
by
luck
or
by
dogged
energy
and
perseverance
on
either
side
the
norwegians
are
in
dangerous
winter
quarters
for
the
ice
is
breaking
out
rapidly
from
the
bay
of
whales
which
they
believe
to
be
borchgrevink
bight
and
they
are
camped
directly
in
front
of
a
distinct
line
of
weakness
on
the
other
hand
if
they
get
through
the
winter
safely
and
they
are
aware
of
their
danger
they
have
unlimited
dogs
the
energy
of
a
nation
as
northern
as
ourselves
and
experience
with
that
could
be
beaten
by
no
collection
of
men
in
the
world
there
remains
the
beardmore
glacier
can
their
dogs
face
it
and
if
so
who
will
get
there
first
one
thing
i
feel
and
that
is
that
our
southern
party
will
go
far
before
they
permit
themselves
to
be
beaten
by
any
one
and
i
think
that
two
parties
are
very
likely
to
reach
the
pole
next
year
but
god
only
knows
which
will
get
there
first
a
few
of
the
things
we
learnt
about
the
norwegians
are
as
follows
the
engines
of
the
fram
occupy
only
half
the
size
of
our
wardroom
the
petrol
tanks
have
not
needed
replenishment
since
they
left
norway
and
their
propeller
can
be
lifted
by
three
men
they
kept
fresh
potatoes
from
norway
to
the
barrier
some
of
them
must
surely
be
renegade
irishmen
they
have
each
a
separate
cabin
in
the
fram
and
are
very
comfortable
they
are
using
for
transporting
their
stores
to
the
hut
eight
teams
of
five
dogs
each
working
every
alternate
day
they
intend
to
use
for
the
polar
journey
teams
of
ten
dogs
each
team
working
one
day
out
of
two
their
dogs
stop
at
a
whistle
and
if
they
make
a
break
they
can
be
stopped
by
overturning
the
sledge
empty
or
full
as
the
case
may
be
they
are
nine
in
the
shore
party
and
ten
in
the
ship
their
ship
is
going
back
to
buenos
ayres
with
nilsen
in
charge
and
during
the
winter
is
to
encircle
the
world
sounding
all
the
way
they
are
not
starting
on
the
dash
south
this
year
and
do
not
yet
know
whether
they
will
lay
depôts
this
year
they
have
dogs
and
ten
of
these
are
bitches
so
that
they
can
rear
pups
and
have
done
so
very
successfully
on
the
way
out
the
fram
acts
like
a
cork
in
the
sea
she
rolls
tremendously
but
does
not
ship
water
and
during
the
voyage
they
have
had
the
dogs
running
loose
about
the
decks
there
is
a
lot
more
miscellaneous
information
but
i
may
remember
it
more
coherently
a
little
later
when
the
main
impressions
of
the
rencontre
are
a
little
more
faint
it
will
be
seen
that
priestley
missed
three
points
first
he
was
left
with
a
conventional
but
very
erroneous
impression
of
amundsen
as
a
blunt
norwegian
sailor
not
in
the
least
an
intellectual
second
he
thought
amundsen
had
camped
on
the
ice
and
not
on
terra
firma
third
he
thought
amundsen
was
going
to
the
pole
by
the
old
route
over
the
beardmore
the
truth
was
that
amundsen
was
an
explorer
of
the
markedly
intellectual
type
rather
jewish
than
scandinavian
who
had
proved
his
sagacity
by
discovering
solid
footing
for
the
winter
by
pure
judgment
for
the
moment
let
it
be
confessed
we
all
underrated
amundsen
and
could
not
shake
off
the
feeling
that
he
had
stolen
a
march
on
us
back
to
mcmurdo
sound
and
the
news
left
at
hut
point
then
the
two
ponies
which
had
been
allotted
to
campbell
were
swum
ashore
at
cape
evans
since
he
thought
that
now
they
would
be
of
more
use
to
scott
than
to
himself
subsequent
events
proved
the
extreme
usefulness
of
this
unselfish
act
the
terra
nova
would
steam
north
and
try
and
land
campbell
party
on
the
extreme
northern
shores
of
queen
victoria
land
at
the
same
time
there
was
so
little
coal
left
that
it
might
be
necessary
to
go
straight
back
to
new
zealand
campbell
regretted
not
being
able
to
see
scott
supposing
that
the
altered
circumstances
caused
scott
to
wish
to
rearrange
his
parties
and
also
because
amundsen
had
asked
campbell
to
land
his
party
at
the
bay
of
whales
giving
him
the
area
to
the
east
to
explore
and
campbell
did
not
wish
to
accept
before
getting
permission
as
we
know
now
coal
ran
so
short
that
it
came
to
an
alternative
of
dumping
campbell
his
men
and
gear
hastily
on
the
beach
at
cape
adare
or
taking
them
back
to
new
zealand
as
one
member
of
the
crew
said
exploring
is
all
very
well
in
its
way
but
it
is
a
thing
which
can
be
very
easily
overdone
the
ship
was
as
ready
to
get
rid
of
them
as
they
were
to
get
rid
of
the
ship
they
were
landed
working
to
their
waists
in
the
surf
and
the
ship
got
safely
back
to
new
zealand
scott
decided
that
the
period
of
waiting
until
the
pony
party
arrived
from
one
ton
should
be
employed
in
sledging
stores
out
to
corner
camp
but
the
were
done
the
dogs
are
thin
as
rakes
they
are
ravenous
and
very
tired
i
feel
this
should
not
be
and
that
it
is
evident
that
they
are
underfed
the
ration
must
be
increased
next
year
and
we
must
have
some
diet
the
biscuit
alone
is
not
good
enough
in
addition
several
dogs
were
feeling
the
effects
of
injuries
due
to
the
crevasse
incident
there
remained
the
men
and
the
one
pony
which
had
survived
out
of
the
three
sent
back
from
bluff
depôt
namely
jimmy
pigg
the
party
started
on
friday
february
marching
by
day
it
consisted
of
scott
crean
and
myself
with
one
sledge
and
tent
lieutenant
evans
atkinson
and
forde
with
a
second
sledge
and
tent
and
keohane
leading
james
pigg
on
the
second
night
out
we
saw
the
pony
party
pass
us
in
the
distance
on
their
way
to
safety
camp
at
corner
camp
scott
decided
to
leave
lieutenant
evans
party
to
come
in
with
the
pony
more
slowly
and
himself
to
push
on
with
crean
and
myself
at
top
speed
for
safety
camp
we
made
a
forced
march
well
into
the
night
doing
miles
for
the
day
and
camped
some
ten
miles
from
safety
camp
where
the
pony
party
must
by
this
time
have
arrived
the
events
which
followed
were
disastrous
and
the
steps
which
led
to
a
catastrophe
which
entailed
the
loss
of
much
of
our
best
transport
and
only
by
a
miracle
did
not
lead
to
the
loss
of
several
lives
were
complicated
at
this
moment
the
night
of
february
there
were
three
parties
on
the
barrier
behind
scott
was
lieutenant
evans
party
and
the
pony
james
pigg
scott
himself
was
camped
within
easy
marching
distance
of
safety
camp
with
crean
and
myself
at
safety
camp
were
the
two
with
wilson
and
meares
while
the
pony
party
from
one
ton
depôt
had
just
arrived
with
five
ponies
which
were
for
the
most
part
thin
hungry
and
worn
between
safety
camp
and
hut
point
lay
the
frozen
sea
which
might
or
might
not
break
up
this
year
but
we
knew
from
our
observations
a
few
days
before
that
the
ice
was
in
a
shaky
condition
at
that
time
the
ice
sheet
extended
some
seven
miles
to
the
north
of
hut
point
the
season
was
fast
closing
in
temperatures
of
fifty
or
sixty
degrees
of
frost
had
been
common
for
the
last
fortnight
and
this
was
bad
for
the
ponies
we
had
been
unfortunate
in
having
several
severe
blizzards
and
it
was
already
clear
that
it
was
these
autumn
blizzards
more
than
cold
temperatures
and
soft
surfaces
which
the
ponies
could
not
endure
scott
was
most
anxious
to
get
the
animals
into
such
shelter
as
we
could
make
for
them
at
hut
point
the
next
morning
february
we
woke
to
a
regular
cold
autumn
blizzard
very
thick
wind
force
and
temperature
about
minus
twenty
this
was
disheartening
and
indeed
with
our
six
worn
ponies
still
on
the
barrier
the
outlook
for
them
was
discouraging
the
blizzard
came
to
an
end
the
next
morning
scott
must
take
up
the
first
part
of
that
story
packed
up
at
and
marched
into
safety
camp
found
every
one
very
cold
and
depressed
wilson
and
meares
had
had
continuous
bad
weather
since
we
left
bowers
and
oates
since
their
arrival
the
blizzard
had
raged
for
two
days
the
animals
looked
in
a
sorry
condition
but
all
were
alive
the
wind
blew
keen
and
cold
from
the
east
there
could
be
no
advantage
in
waiting
here
and
soon
all
arrangements
were
made
for
a
general
shift
to
hut
point
packing
took
a
long
time
the
snowfall
had
been
prodigious
and
parts
of
the
sledges
were
or
feet
under
drift
about
the
two
got
safely
away
then
the
pony
party
prepared
to
go
as
the
cloths
were
stript
from
the
ponies
the
ravages
of
the
blizzard
became
evident
the
animals
without
exception
were
terribly
emaciated
and
weary
willie
was
in
a
pitiable
condition
the
plan
was
for
the
ponies
to
follow
the
dog
tracks
our
small
party
to
start
last
and
get
in
front
of
the
ponies
on
the
i
was
very
anxious
about
the
passage
owing
to
the
spread
of
the
water
holes
the
two
left
with
meares
and
wilson
some
time
before
the
ponies
and
for
the
moment
they
go
out
of
this
story
bowers
pony
uncle
bill
was
ready
first
and
he
started
with
him
we
got
three
more
ponies
harnessed
punch
nobby
and
guts
and
tried
to
harness
weary
willie
but
when
we
attempted
to
lead
him
forward
he
immediately
fell
down
scott
rapidly
reorganized
he
sent
crean
and
me
forward
with
the
three
better
ponies
to
join
bowers
now
waiting
a
mile
ahead
oates
and
gran
he
kept
with
himself
to
try
and
help
the
sick
pony
his
diary
tells
how
we
made
desperate
efforts
to
save
the
poor
creature
got
him
once
more
on
his
legs
gave
him
a
hot
oat
mash
then
after
a
wait
of
an
hour
oates
led
him
off
and
we
packed
the
sledge
and
followed
on
ski
yards
from
the
camp
the
poor
creature
fell
again
and
i
felt
it
was
the
last
effort
we
camped
built
a
snow
wall
round
him
and
did
all
we
possibly
could
to
get
him
on
his
feet
every
effort
was
fruitless
though
the
poor
thing
made
pitiful
struggles
towards
midnight
we
propped
him
up
as
comfortably
as
we
could
and
went
to
bed
wednesday
march
our
pony
died
in
the
night
it
is
hard
to
have
got
him
back
so
far
only
for
this
it
is
clear
that
these
blizzards
are
terrible
for
the
poor
animals
their
coats
are
not
good
but
even
with
the
best
of
coats
it
is
certain
they
would
lose
condition
badly
if
caught
in
one
and
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
condition
at
the
beginning
of
a
journey
it
makes
a
late
start
necessary
for
next
year
well
we
have
done
our
best
and
bought
our
experience
at
a
heavy
cost
now
every
effort
must
be
bent
on
saving
the
remaining
animals
a
letter
from
bowers
home
which
certainly
does
not
overstate
the
adventures
of
himself
and
the
two
men
sent
forward
to
join
him
is
probably
the
best
description
of
the
incidents
which
followed
it
will
be
remembered
that
crean
and
i
with
three
ponies
were
sent
from
safety
camp
to
join
him
he
was
already
leading
one
pony
night
was
beginning
to
fall
and
the
light
was
bad
but
from
the
edge
of
the
barrier
the
two
could
still
be
seen
as
black
dots
in
the
distance
towards
cape
armitage
on
the
night
of
february
i
led
off
with
my
pony
and
was
surprised
at
the
delay
in
the
others
leaving
knowing
nothing
of
weary
collapse
over
the
edge
of
the
barrier
i
went
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
snow
incline
awaited
the
others
to
my
surprise
cherry
and
crean
appeared
with
punch
nobby
and
guts
in
a
string
and
then
i
heard
the
reason
for
oates
and
scott
not
having
come
on
my
orders
were
to
push
on
to
hut
point
over
the
without
delay
and
to
follow
the
dogs
previously
i
had
been
told
to
camp
on
the
only
in
case
of
the
beasts
being
unable
to
go
on
we
had
four
pretty
heavy
sledges
as
we
were
taking
six
weeks
man
food
and
oil
to
the
hut
as
well
as
a
lot
of
gear
from
the
depôt
and
pony
food
etc
unfortunately
the
dogs
misunderstood
their
orders
and
instead
of
piloting
us
dashed
off
on
their
own
we
saw
them
like
specks
in
the
distance
in
the
direction
of
the
old
seal
crack
having
crossed
this
they
wheeled
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
cape
armitage
and
disappeared
into
a
black
indefinite
mist
which
seemed
to
pervade
everything
in
that
direction
we
heard
afterwards
that
in
a
mile
or
two
they
came
to
some
alarming
signs
and
turning
made
for
the
gap
where
they
got
up
on
to
the
land
about
midnight
i
plugged
on
in
their
tracks
till
we
came
to
the
seal
crack
which
was
an
old
running
many
miles
from
pram
point
we
considered
the
ice
behind
this
crack
over
which
we
had
just
come
fast
ice
it
was
older
ice
than
that
beyond
as
it
had
undoubtedly
frozen
over
first
having
crossed
the
crack
we
streaked
on
for
cape
armitage
the
animals
were
going
badly
owing
to
the
effects
of
the
blizzard
and
frequent
stoppages
were
necessary
on
coming
to
some
shaky
ice
we
headed
farther
west
as
there
were
always
some
bad
places
off
the
cape
and
i
thought
it
better
to
make
a
good
circuit
crean
who
had
been
over
the
ice
recently
told
me
it
was
all
right
farther
round
however
about
a
mile
farther
on
i
began
to
have
misgivings
the
cracks
became
too
frequent
to
be
pleasant
and
although
the
ice
was
from
five
to
ten
feet
thick
one
does
not
like
to
see
water
squelching
between
them
as
we
did
later
it
spells
motion
and
motion
on
means
breakage
i
shoved
on
in
the
hope
of
getting
on
better
ice
round
the
cape
but
at
last
came
a
moving
crack
and
that
decided
me
to
turn
back
we
could
see
nothing
owing
to
the
black
mist
everything
looked
solid
as
ever
but
i
knew
enough
to
mistrust
moving
ice
however
solid
it
seemed
it
was
a
beastly
march
back
dark
gloomy
and
depressing
the
beasts
got
more
and
more
down
in
their
spirits
and
stopped
so
frequently
that
i
thought
we
would
never
reach
the
seal
crack
i
said
to
cherry
however
that
i
would
take
no
risks
and
camp
well
over
the
other
side
on
the
old
sound
ice
if
we
could
get
there
this
we
managed
to
do
eventually
here
there
was
soft
snow
whereas
on
the
sea
side
of
the
crack
it
was
hard
that
is
the
reason
we
lost
the
dogs
tracks
at
once
on
crossing
even
over
this
crack
i
thought
it
best
to
march
as
far
in
as
possible
we
got
well
into
the
bay
as
far
as
our
exhausted
ponies
would
drag
before
i
camped
and
threw
up
the
walls
fed
the
beasts
and
retired
to
feed
ourselves
we
had
only
the
primus
with
the
missing
cap
and
it
took
over
hours
to
heat
up
the
water
however
we
had
a
cup
of
pemmican
it
was
very
dark
and
i
mistook
a
small
bag
of
curry
powder
for
the
cocoa
bag
and
made
cocoa
with
that
mixed
with
sugar
crean
drank
his
right
down
before
discovering
anything
was
wrong
it
was
before
we
were
ready
to
turn
in
i
went
out
and
saw
everything
quiet
the
mist
still
hung
to
the
west
but
you
could
see
a
good
mile
and
all
was
still
the
sky
was
very
dark
over
the
strait
though
the
unmistakable
sign
of
open
water
i
turned
in
two
and
a
half
hours
later
i
awoke
hearing
a
noise
both
my
companions
were
snoring
i
thought
it
was
that
and
was
on
the
point
of
turning
in
again
having
seen
that
it
was
only
when
i
heard
the
noise
again
i
thought
pony
is
at
the
oats
and
went
out
i
can
not
describe
either
the
scene
or
my
feelings
i
must
leave
those
to
your
imagination
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
floating
pack
of
ice
the
tops
of
the
hills
were
visible
but
all
below
was
thin
mist
and
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
was
nothing
solid
it
was
all
broken
up
and
heaving
up
and
down
with
the
swell
long
black
tongues
of
water
were
everywhere
the
floe
on
which
we
were
had
split
right
under
our
picketing
line
and
cut
poor
guts
wall
in
half
guts
himself
had
gone
and
a
dark
streak
of
water
alone
showed
the
place
where
the
ice
had
opened
under
him
the
two
sledges
securing
the
other
end
of
the
line
were
on
the
next
floe
and
had
been
pulled
right
to
the
edge
our
camp
was
on
a
floe
not
more
than
yards
across
i
shouted
to
cherry
and
crean
and
rushed
out
in
my
socks
to
save
the
two
sledges
the
two
floes
were
touching
farther
on
and
i
dragged
them
to
this
place
and
got
them
on
to
our
floe
at
that
moment
our
own
floe
split
in
two
but
we
were
all
together
on
one
piece
i
then
got
my
finnesko
on
remarking
that
we
had
been
in
a
few
tight
places
but
this
was
about
the
limit
i
have
been
told
since
that
i
was
quixotic
not
to
leave
everything
and
make
for
safety
you
will
understand
however
that
i
never
for
one
moment
considered
the
abandonment
of
anything
we
packed
up
camp
and
harnessed
up
our
ponies
in
remarkably
quick
time
when
ready
to
move
i
had
to
decide
which
way
to
go
obviously
towards
cape
armitage
was
impossible
and
to
the
eastward
also
as
the
wind
was
from
that
direction
and
we
were
already
floating
west
towards
the
open
sound
our
only
hope
lay
to
the
south
and
thither
i
went
we
found
the
ponies
would
jump
the
intervals
well
at
least
punch
would
and
the
other
two
would
follow
him
my
idea
was
never
to
separate
but
to
get
everything
on
to
one
floe
at
a
time
and
then
wait
till
it
touched
or
nearly
touched
another
in
the
right
direction
and
then
jump
the
ponies
over
and
drag
the
four
sledges
across
ourselves
in
this
way
we
made
slow
but
sure
progress
while
one
was
acting
all
was
well
the
waiting
for
a
lead
to
close
was
the
worst
trial
sometimes
it
would
take
minutes
or
more
but
there
was
so
much
motion
in
the
ice
that
sooner
or
later
bump
you
would
go
against
another
piece
and
then
it
was
up
and
over
sometimes
they
split
sometimes
they
bounced
back
so
quickly
that
only
one
horse
could
get
over
and
then
we
had
to
wait
again
we
had
to
make
frequent
detours
and
were
moving
west
all
the
time
with
the
pack
still
we
were
getting
south
too
very
little
was
said
crean
like
most
bluejackets
behaved
as
if
he
had
done
this
sort
of
thing
often
before
cherry
the
practical
after
an
hour
or
two
dug
out
some
chocolate
and
biscuit
during
one
of
our
enforced
waits
and
distributed
it
i
felt
at
that
time
that
food
was
the
last
thing
on
earth
i
wanted
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
in
less
than
half
an
hour
though
i
had
eaten
the
lot
the
ponies
behaved
as
well
as
my
companions
and
jumped
the
floes
in
great
style
after
getting
them
on
a
new
floe
we
simply
left
them
and
there
they
stood
chewing
at
each
others
head
ropes
or
harness
till
we
were
over
with
the
sledges
and
ready
to
take
them
on
again
their
implicit
trust
in
us
was
touching
to
behold
a
sledge
makes
an
excellent
bridge
if
an
opening
is
too
wide
to
jump
after
some
hours
we
saw
fast
ice
ahead
and
thanked
god
for
it
meanwhile
a
further
unpleasantness
occurred
in
the
arrival
of
a
host
of
the
terrible
whales
these
were
reaping
a
harvest
of
seal
in
the
ice
and
cruised
among
the
floes
with
their
immense
black
fins
sticking
up
and
blowing
with
a
terrific
roar
the
killer
is
scientifically
known
as
the
orca
and
though
far
smaller
than
the
sperm
and
other
large
whales
is
a
much
more
dangerous
animal
he
is
armed
with
a
huge
iron
jaw
and
great
blunt
socket
teeth
killers
act
in
concert
too
and
as
you
may
remember
nearly
got
ponting
when
we
were
unloading
the
ship
by
pressing
up
the
thin
ice
from
beneath
and
splitting
it
in
all
directions
it
took
us
over
six
hours
to
get
close
to
the
fast
ice
which
proved
to
be
the
barrier
some
immense
chunks
of
which
we
actually
saw
break
off
and
join
the
pack
close
in
the
motion
was
less
owing
to
the
jambing
up
of
the
ice
somewhere
farther
west
we
had
only
just
cleared
the
strait
in
time
though
as
all
the
ice
in
the
centre
released
beyond
cape
armitage
headed
off
into
the
middle
of
the
strait
and
thence
to
the
ross
sea
our
spirits
rose
as
we
neared
the
barrier
edge
and
i
made
for
a
big
sloping
floe
which
i
expected
would
be
touching
at
any
rate
i
anticipated
no
difficulty
we
rushed
up
the
slope
towards
safety
and
were
little
prepared
for
the
scene
that
met
our
eyes
at
the
top
all
along
the
barrier
face
a
broad
lane
of
water
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
wide
extended
this
was
filled
with
brash
ice
which
was
heaving
up
and
down
to
the
swell
like
the
contents
of
a
cauldron
killers
were
cruising
there
with
fiendish
activity
and
the
barrier
edge
was
a
sheer
cliff
of
ice
on
the
other
side
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
high
it
was
a
case
of
so
near
and
yet
so
far
suddenly
our
great
sloping
floe
calved
in
two
so
we
beat
a
hasty
retreat
i
selected
a
floe
just
clear
of
this
turmoil
that
was
at
least
ten
feet
thick
and
fairly
rounded
with
a
flat
surface
here
we
collected
everything
and
having
done
all
that
man
could
do
we
fed
the
beasts
and
took
counsel
cherry
and
crean
both
volunteered
to
do
anything
in
the
spirit
they
had
shown
right
through
it
appeared
of
first
necessity
to
communicate
with
captain
scott
i
guessed
his
anxiety
on
our
behalf
and
as
we
could
do
nothing
more
we
wanted
help
of
some
sort
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
man
working
up
to
windward
along
the
barrier
face
might
happen
upon
a
floe
touching
the
barrier
it
was
obviously
impossible
to
take
ponies
up
there
anywhere
but
an
active
man
might
wait
his
opportunity
going
to
windward
too
he
could
always
retreat
on
to
our
floe
as
the
ice
was
being
pushed
together
in
our
direction
the
next
consideration
was
whom
to
send
to
go
myself
was
out
of
the
question
the
problem
was
whether
to
send
one
or
both
my
companions
as
my
object
was
to
save
the
animals
and
gear
it
appeared
to
me
that
one
man
remaining
would
be
helpless
in
the
event
of
the
floe
splitting
up
as
he
would
be
busy
saving
himself
i
therefore
decided
to
send
one
only
this
would
have
to
be
crean
as
cherry
who
wears
glasses
could
not
see
so
well
both
volunteered
but
as
i
say
i
thought
out
all
the
pros
and
cons
and
sent
crean
knowing
that
at
the
worst
he
could
get
back
to
us
at
any
time
i
sent
a
note
to
captain
scott
and
stuffing
crean
pockets
with
food
we
saw
him
depart
practical
cherry
suggested
pitching
the
tent
as
a
mark
of
our
whereabouts
and
having
done
this
i
mounted
the
theodolite
to
watch
crean
through
the
telescope
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
floe
made
this
difficult
especially
as
a
number
of
emperor
penguins
came
up
and
looked
just
like
men
in
the
distance
fortunately
the
sunlight
cleared
the
frost
smoke
and
as
it
fell
calm
our
westerly
motion
began
to
decrease
the
swell
started
to
go
down
outside
us
in
the
centre
of
the
strait
all
the
ice
had
gone
out
and
open
water
remained
we
were
one
of
a
line
of
loose
floes
floating
near
the
barrier
edge
crean
was
hours
moving
to
and
fro
before
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
up
on
the
barrier
i
said
god
one
of
us
is
out
of
the
wood
anyhow
it
was
not
a
pleasant
day
that
cherry
and
i
spent
all
alone
there
knowing
as
we
did
that
it
only
wanted
a
zephyr
from
the
south
to
send
us
irretrievably
out
to
sea
still
there
is
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
one
has
done
one
utmost
and
i
felt
that
having
been
delivered
so
wonderfully
so
far
the
same
hand
would
not
forsake
us
at
the
last
we
gave
the
ponies
all
they
could
eat
that
day
the
killers
were
too
interested
in
us
to
be
pleasant
they
had
a
habit
of
bobbing
up
and
down
perpendicularly
so
as
to
see
over
the
edge
of
a
floe
in
looking
for
seals
the
huge
black
and
yellow
heads
with
sickening
pig
eyes
only
a
few
yards
from
us
at
times
and
always
around
us
are
among
the
most
disconcerting
recollections
i
have
of
that
day
the
immense
fins
were
bad
enough
but
when
they
started
a
perpendicular
dodge
they
were
positively
beastly
as
the
day
wore
on
skua
gulls
looking
upon
us
as
certain
carrion
settled
down
comfortably
near
us
to
await
developments
the
swell
however
was
getting
less
and
less
and
it
resolved
itself
into
a
question
of
speed
as
to
whether
the
wind
or
captain
scott
would
reach
us
first
crean
had
got
up
into
the
barrier
at
great
risks
to
himself
as
i
gathered
afterwards
from
his
very
modest
account
he
had
reached
captain
scott
some
time
after
his
scott
meeting
with
wilson
i
heard
that
at
the
time
captain
scott
was
very
angry
with
me
for
not
abandoning
everything
and
getting
away
safely
myself
for
my
own
part
i
must
say
that
the
abandoning
of
the
ponies
was
the
one
thing
that
had
never
entered
my
head
it
was
a
long
way
round
but
at
he
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
barrier
opposite
us
with
oates
and
crean
everything
was
still
and
cherry
and
i
could
have
got
on
safe
ice
at
any
time
during
the
last
half
hour
by
using
the
sledge
as
a
ladder
a
big
overturned
fragment
had
jambed
in
the
lane
between
a
high
floe
and
the
barrier
edge
and
there
being
no
wind
it
remained
there
however
there
was
the
consideration
of
the
ponies
so
we
waited
scott
instead
of
blowing
me
up
was
too
relieved
at
our
safety
to
be
anything
but
pleased
i
said
about
the
ponies
and
the
sledges
he
said
do
care
a
damn
about
the
ponies
and
sledges
it
you
i
want
and
i
am
going
to
see
you
safe
here
up
on
the
barrier
before
i
do
anything
else
cherry
and
i
had
got
everything
ready
so
dragging
up
two
sledges
we
dumped
the
gear
off
them
and
using
them
as
ladders
one
down
from
the
berg
on
to
the
buffer
piece
of
ice
and
the
other
up
to
the
top
of
the
barrier
we
got
up
without
difficulty
captain
scott
was
so
pleased
that
i
realized
the
feeling
he
must
have
had
all
day
he
had
been
blaming
himself
for
our
deaths
and
here
we
were
very
much
alive
he
said
dear
chaps
you
ca
think
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
safe
cherry
likewise
i
was
all
for
saving
the
beasts
and
sledges
however
so
he
let
us
go
back
and
haul
the
sledges
on
to
the
nearest
floe
we
did
this
one
by
one
and
brought
the
ponies
along
while
titus
dug
down
a
slope
from
the
barrier
edge
in
the
hope
of
getting
the
ponies
up
it
scott
knew
more
about
ice
than
any
of
us
and
realizing
the
danger
we
did
still
wanted
to
abandon
things
i
fought
for
my
point
tooth
and
nail
and
got
him
to
concede
one
article
and
then
another
and
still
the
ice
did
not
move
till
we
had
thrown
and
hauled
up
every
article
on
to
the
barrier
except
the
two
ladders
and
the
ponies
to
my
intense
disappointment
at
this
juncture
the
ice
started
to
move
again
titus
had
been
digging
down
a
road
in
the
barrier
edge
and
i
hoped
to
dig
down
a
similar
slope
from
the
floe
the
snow
thus
shovelled
down
would
go
over
the
blue
ice
chunk
cover
up
the
slippery
ice
and
level
it
up
it
would
have
taken
hours
but
was
the
only
chance
of
getting
the
animals
up
we
dug
like
fury
until
captain
scott
peremptorily
ordered
us
up
i
ran
up
on
the
floe
and
took
the
nosebags
off
the
ponies
before
we
got
on
to
the
barrier
and
hauled
the
sledges
up
it
was
only
just
in
time
there
was
the
faintest
air
but
like
a
black
snake
the
lane
of
water
stretched
between
the
ponies
and
ourselves
it
widened
almost
imperceptibly
feet
feet
feet
feet
and
sick
as
we
were
about
the
ponies
we
were
glad
to
be
on
the
safe
side
of
that
we
dragged
the
sledges
in
a
little
way
and
leaving
them
pitched
the
two
tents
half
a
mile
farther
in
for
bits
of
the
barrier
were
continually
calving
while
supper
it
was
about
was
being
cooked
scott
and
i
walked
down
again
the
wind
had
gone
to
the
east
and
all
the
ice
was
under
weigh
a
lane
feet
wide
extended
along
the
barrier
edge
and
killers
were
chasing
up
and
down
it
like
racehorses
our
three
unfortunate
beasts
were
some
way
out
sailing
parallel
to
the
barrier
we
returned
and
if
ever
one
could
feel
miserable
i
did
then
my
feelings
were
nothing
to
what
poor
captain
scott
had
had
to
endure
that
day
i
at
once
broached
the
hopeful
side
of
the
subject
remarking
that
with
the
two
campbell
had
left
we
had
ten
ponies
at
winter
quarters
he
said
however
that
he
had
no
confidence
whatever
in
the
motors
after
the
way
their
rollers
had
become
messed
up
unloading
the
ship
he
had
had
his
confidence
in
the
dogs
much
shaken
on
the
return
journey
and
now
he
had
lost
the
most
solid
asset
the
best
of
his
pony
transport
he
said
course
we
shall
have
a
run
for
our
money
next
season
but
as
far
as
the
pole
is
concerned
i
have
but
very
little
hope
we
had
a
mournful
meal
but
after
the
others
turned
in
i
went
down
again
and
by
striking
across
diagonally
came
abreast
of
the
ponies
floe
over
a
mile
away
they
were
moving
west
fast
but
they
saw
me
and
remained
huddled
together
not
the
least
disturbed
or
doubting
that
we
would
bring
them
their
breakfast
nosebags
as
usual
in
the
morning
poor
trustful
creatures
if
i
could
have
done
it
then
i
would
gladly
have
killed
them
rather
than
picture
them
starving
on
that
floe
out
on
the
ross
sea
or
eaten
by
the
exultant
killers
that
cruised
around
after
breakfast
captain
scott
sent
me
to
bring
up
the
sledges
it
was
dead
calm
again
hope
always
springs
so
i
took
his
pair
of
glasses
and
looked
west
from
the
barrier
edge
nearly
all
the
ice
had
gone
but
a
medley
of
floes
had
been
hurled
up
against
a
long
point
of
barrier
much
farther
west
to
my
delight
i
saw
three
green
specks
on
one
of
these
the
pony
rugs
and
all
four
of
us
legged
it
back
to
the
tent
to
tell
captain
scott
we
were
soon
off
over
the
barrier
it
was
a
long
way
but
we
had
a
tent
and
some
food
crean
had
a
bad
day
of
and
could
see
absolutely
nothing
so
on
arrival
at
the
place
we
pitched
the
tent
and
left
him
there
the
ponies
were
in
a
much
worse
place
than
the
day
before
but
the
ice
was
still
there
and
some
floes
actually
touched
the
barrier
after
our
recent
experience
captain
scott
would
only
let
us
go
on
condition
that
as
soon
as
he
gave
the
order
we
were
to
drop
everything
and
run
for
the
barrier
i
was
in
a
feverish
hurry
and
with
titus
and
cherry
selected
a
possible
route
over
about
six
floes
and
some
low
brash
ice
the
hardest
jump
was
the
first
one
but
it
was
nothing
to
what
they
had
done
the
day
before
so
we
put
punch
at
it
why
he
hung
fire
i
can
not
think
but
he
did
at
the
very
edge
and
the
next
moment
was
in
the
water
i
will
draw
a
veil
over
our
struggle
to
get
the
plucky
little
pony
out
we
could
not
manage
it
and
titus
had
at
last
to
put
an
end
to
his
struggles
with
a
pick
there
was
now
my
pony
and
nobby
we
abandoned
that
route
while
captain
scott
looked
out
another
and
longer
one
by
going
right
out
on
the
this
we
decided
on
if
we
could
get
the
animals
off
their
present
floe
which
necessitated
a
good
jump
on
any
side
captain
scott
said
he
would
have
no
repetition
of
punch
misfortune
if
he
could
help
it
he
would
rather
kill
them
on
the
floe
anyhow
we
rushed
old
nobby
at
the
jump
but
he
refused
it
seemed
no
good
but
i
rushed
him
at
it
again
and
again
scott
was
for
killing
them
it
should
be
remembered
that
this
ice
with
the
men
on
it
might
drift
away
from
the
barrier
at
any
moment
and
then
there
might
be
no
further
chance
of
saving
the
men
but
i
was
not
and
pretending
not
to
hear
him
i
rushed
the
old
beast
again
he
cleared
it
beautifully
and
titus
seizing
the
opportunity
ran
my
pony
at
it
with
similar
success
we
then
returned
to
the
barrier
and
worked
along
westward
till
a
suitable
place
for
getting
up
was
found
there
scott
and
cherry
started
digging
a
road
while
titus
and
i
went
out
via
the
to
get
the
ponies
we
had
an
empty
sledge
as
a
bridge
or
ladder
in
case
of
emergency
and
had
to
negotiate
about
forty
floes
to
reach
the
animals
it
was
pretty
easy
going
though
and
we
brought
them
along
with
great
success
as
far
as
the
two
nearest
floes
at
this
place
the
ice
was
jambed
nobby
cleared
the
last
jump
splendidly
when
suddenly
in
the
open
water
pond
on
one
side
a
school
of
over
a
dozen
of
the
terrible
whales
arose
this
must
have
flurried
my
horse
just
as
he
was
jumping
as
instead
of
going
straight
he
jumped
sideways
and
just
missed
the
floe
with
his
hind
legs
it
was
another
horrible
situation
but
scott
rushed
nobby
up
on
the
barrier
while
titus
cherry
and
i
struggled
with
poor
old
uncle
bill
why
the
whales
did
not
come
under
the
ice
and
attack
him
i
can
not
say
perhaps
they
were
full
of
seal
perhaps
they
were
so
engaged
in
looking
at
us
on
the
top
of
the
floe
that
they
forgot
to
look
below
anyhow
we
got
him
safely
as
far
as
the
bottom
of
the
barrier
cliff
pulling
him
through
the
thin
ice
towards
a
low
patch
of
brash
captain
scott
was
afraid
of
something
happening
to
us
with
those
devilish
whales
so
close
and
was
for
abandoning
the
horse
right
away
i
had
no
eyes
or
ears
for
anything
but
the
horse
just
then
and
getting
on
to
the
thin
brash
ice
got
the
alpine
rope
fast
to
each
of
the
forefeet
crean
was
too
blind
to
do
anything
but
hold
the
rescued
horse
on
the
barrier
but
the
other
four
of
us
pulled
might
and
main
till
we
got
the
old
horse
out
and
lying
on
his
side
the
brash
ice
was
so
thin
that
had
a
come
up
then
he
would
have
scattered
it
and
the
lot
of
us
into
the
water
like
chaff
i
was
sick
with
disappointment
when
i
found
that
my
horse
could
not
rise
titus
said
done
we
shall
never
get
him
up
alive
the
cold
water
and
shock
on
top
of
all
his
recent
troubles
had
been
too
much
for
the
undefeated
old
sportsman
in
vain
i
tried
to
get
him
to
his
feet
three
times
he
tried
and
then
fell
over
backwards
into
the
water
again
at
that
moment
a
new
danger
arose
the
whole
piece
of
barrier
itself
started
to
subside
it
had
evidently
been
broken
before
and
the
tide
was
doing
the
rest
we
were
ordered
up
and
it
certainly
was
all
too
necessary
still
titus
and
i
hung
over
the
old
uncle
bill
head
i
said
ca
leave
him
to
be
eaten
alive
by
those
whales
there
was
a
pick
lying
up
on
the
floe
titus
said
shall
be
sick
if
i
have
to
kill
another
horse
like
i
did
the
last
i
had
no
intention
that
anybody
should
kill
my
own
horse
but
myself
and
getting
the
pick
i
struck
where
titus
told
me
i
made
sure
of
my
job
before
we
ran
up
and
jumped
the
opening
in
the
barrier
carrying
a
instead
of
leading
the
pony
i
had
almost
considered
safe
we
returned
to
our
old
camp
that
night
march
with
nobby
the
only
one
saved
of
the
five
that
left
one
ton
depôt
i
was
fearfully
cut
up
about
my
pony
and
punch
but
it
was
better
than
last
night
we
knew
they
would
not
have
to
starve
and
that
all
their
troubles
were
now
at
an
end
before
supper
i
went
for
a
walk
along
the
barrier
with
scott
and
the
next
day
we
started
back
we
left
one
tent
two
sledges
and
a
lot
of
gear
as
nobby
could
only
pull
two
light
sledges
and
we
could
not
pull
an
excessive
weight
on
that
bad
surface
as
it
was
we
had
over
lbs
on
the
sledge
when
we
left
it
was
a
glaring
day
with
the
surface
soft
and
sandy
a
combination
of
unpleasant
circumstances
it
took
five
hours
to
drag
as
far
as
the
place
we
had
originally
gone
down
on
to
the
from
the
barrier
evans
and
his
party
should
now
have
arrived
from
corner
camp
and
as
captain
scott
wanted
to
see
if
they
had
left
a
note
at
safety
camp
i
walked
up
there
while
the
tea
was
being
brewed
it
was
about
miles
away
and
i
found
traces
of
the
party
in
the
snow
but
no
note
it
fed
me
up
to
see
the
walls
so
recently
occupied
by
our
ponies
and
i
was
glad
to
leave
the
afternoon
march
was
interminable
it
seemed
as
if
we
would
never
reach
the
coast
at
last
we
came
to
the
pram
point
pressure
ridges
where
the
barrier
joins
the
peninsula
to
eastward
of
cape
armitage
they
are
waves
of
ice
up
to
feet
in
height
running
along
parallel
to
each
other
with
a
valley
in
between
each
and
are
only
crevassed
badly
at
the
outer
end
as
far
as
we
have
seen
though
there
are
smaller
crevasses
right
along
we
camped
in
one
of
these
valleys
about
i
was
thoroughly
tired
so
i
think
was
everybody
else
we
were
about
a
mile
from
the
ice
edge
and
the
problem
was
where
to
get
nobby
up
the
precipitous
slopes
this
was
solved
by
the
arrival
of
evans
atkinson
forde
and
keohane
about
midnight
they
had
seen
us
coming
in
from
the
heights
and
had
come
down
for
news
teddy
evans
had
arrived
the
day
before
and
being
warned
off
the
barrier
edge
by
a
note
left
by
captain
scott
had
made
for
the
land
with
his
party
and
one
horse
jimmy
pigg
he
had
found
a
good
way
up
a
mile
or
so
farther
east
almost
under
castle
rock
he
had
walked
to
hut
point
with
atkinson
the
next
day
and
heard
of
the
loss
of
cherry
myself
and
the
animals
from
bill
wilson
and
meares
who
had
been
left
there
to
look
after
their
teams
i
had
seen
atkinson
for
quite
a
while
when
we
met
this
time
the
next
day
we
relayed
the
sledges
up
the
slope
which
was
about
feet
high
rising
from
a
small
bay
it
was
so
steep
that
the
pony
could
only
be
led
up
and
we
had
to
put
on
crampons
to
grip
the
ice
these
are
merely
a
sole
of
leather
with
light
metal
plates
for
foot
and
heel
containing
spikes
these
were
altered
afterwards
they
have
leather
beckets
and
a
lanyard
rove
off
for
making
them
fast
over
the
finnesko
it
took
us
all
the
morning
to
get
everything
up
to
the
top
and
then
it
started
to
blow
the
camp
was
wonderfully
sheltered
jimmy
pigg
and
nobby
were
reunited
after
many
weeks
and
to
show
their
friendliness
the
former
bit
the
latter
in
the
back
of
the
neck
as
a
first
introduction
atkinson
had
gone
to
hut
point
to
reassure
uncle
bill
as
to
our
safety
and
arrived
again
with
gran
just
as
we
got
the
last
load
up
there
was
no
sugar
at
the
hut
except
what
the
dogs
had
brought
in
so
gran
who
was
quite
fresh
volunteered
to
get
a
couple
of
bags
from
the
depôt
at
safety
camp
which
could
plainly
be
seen
out
on
the
barrier
we
all
went
to
the
edge
of
the
slope
to
see
him
go
down
it
on
ski
he
did
it
splendidly
and
must
have
been
going
with
the
speed
of
an
express
train
down
the
incline
as
he
was
on
the
barrier
in
an
incredibly
short
time
compared
to
the
hours
we
had
dragged
up
the
same
slope
with
the
loads
teddy
titus
and
keohane
were
left
at
the
camp
to
be
joined
by
gran
later
scott
started
off
for
hut
point
with
crean
and
cherry
on
his
sledge
while
i
followed
with
forde
and
atkinson
the
others
helped
us
up
several
hundred
feet
of
slope
and
left
us
under
castle
rock
it
was
here
that
they
mistook
their
way
in
the
blizzard
and
lost
a
man
from
the
discovery
though
it
was
fine
below
it
was
blowing
like
anything
on
the
heights
i
was
too
busily
occupied
to
see
much
of
the
hills
and
which
i
got
to
know
so
well
later
it
was
about
three
miles
direct
to
the
hut
but
very
up
and
down
hill
at
the
last
however
you
see
the
bay
in
panorama
with
cape
armitage
on
one
side
and
hut
point
on
the
other
where
the
discovery
lay
two
whole
years
it
is
a
magnificent
view
from
the
heights
and
for
wild
desolate
grandeur
would
take
some
beating
the
western
mountains
and
the
great
dome
of
mount
discovery
across
the
black
strait
of
water
covered
with
dark
frost
smoke
and
here
and
there
an
iceberg
driving
fast
towards
the
sea
about
half
a
mile
below
us
was
the
little
hut
and
on
the
left
the
pyramid
of
observation
hill
it
is
a
perfect
chaos
of
hills
and
extinct
craters
just
here
it
was
blowing
like
fun
we
left
one
sledge
on
the
top
of
and
just
took
what
was
necessary
on
the
other
such
as
our
bags
etc
it
was
my
first
experience
of
steep
downhill
sledging
instead
of
anybody
pulling
forward
we
all
had
to
hang
back
and
guide
the
sledge
down
the
slippery
incline
without
letting
it
take
charge
or
getting
upset
it
is
great
fun
on
reaching
the
head
of
the
bay
however
we
had
quite
a
dangerous
little
bit
to
cross
here
it
was
swept
of
snow
and
there
was
nothing
but
glassy
ice
and
the
incline
ended
in
a
low
with
the
water
below
it
attached
as
we
were
to
the
sledge
we
should
have
been
at
a
disadvantage
had
it
come
to
swimming
which
a
slip
might
easily
have
brought
about
we
scratched
carefully
across
this
and
then
headed
down
on
the
snow
arriving
at
the
hut
all
well
the
old
hut
had
changed
tremendously
since
i
last
saw
it
having
been
dug
out
and
cleared
of
snow
and
ice
two
unrecognizable
sweeps
greeted
us
heartily
they
were
bill
and
meares
the
dogs
howled
a
chorus
for
our
benefit
it
was
quite
like
coming
home
inside
the
hut
the
cause
of
the
blackness
was
apparent
they
had
a
blubber
fire
going
an
open
one
with
no
chimney
or
uptake
for
the
smoke
after
such
a
long
life
it
fairly
choked
me
and
for
once
i
could
not
eat
a
square
meal
we
all
slept
in
a
row
against
the
west
wall
of
the
hut
with
our
feet
inboard
the
next
morning
captain
scott
bill
cherry
and
i
set
out
to
walk
to
castle
rock
and
meet
the
other
party
it
was
fairly
fizzing
from
the
sea
but
clear
once
up
on
the
heights
however
we
seemed
to
get
less
wind
a
couple
of
hours
later
we
were
at
the
great
rock
castle
rock
which
is
one
of
the
best
landmarks
about
here
the
party
in
the
saddle
camp
had
relayed
two
of
the
sledges
up
the
slope
these
we
hauled
on
to
the
top
while
the
two
ponies
were
harnessed
and
brought
up
there
were
three
sledges
left
to
take
on
altogether
so
the
ponies
took
one
each
and
we
the
other
meanwhile
captain
scott
walked
over
the
shoulder
under
castle
rock
to
see
down
the
strait
and
came
back
with
the
intelligence
that
he
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
but
half
the
glacier
tongue
had
broken
off
and
disappeared
this
great
tongue
of
ice
had
stood
there
on
arrival
of
the
discovery
ten
years
before
and
had
remained
ever
since
it
had
a
depôt
of
shackleton
on
it
and
campbell
had
depôted
his
fodder
on
it
for
us
on
the
eventful
night
of
the
of
the
ice
at
least
three
miles
of
the
tongue
which
had
been
considered
practically
terra
firma
had
gone
after
having
been
there
probably
for
centuries
we
headed
for
the
hut
bill
had
looked
out
a
route
for
the
ponies
to
avoid
slippery
places
it
started
to
bliz
but
was
not
too
thick
for
us
to
see
our
bearings
at
the
top
of
ski
slope
the
ponies
were
taken
out
of
the
sledges
and
led
down
a
circuitous
route
over
the
rocks
the
rest
of
us
put
everything
we
wanted
on
one
sledge
and
leaving
the
others
up
there
went
down
the
slope
as
before
the
two
ponies
arrived
before
us
and
were
stabled
in
the
verandah
that
night
for
the
first
time
since
the
establishment
of
safety
camp
the
depôt
party
were
all
together
again
minus
six
ponies
in
concluding
my
report
to
captain
scott
on
the
incident
which
he
asked
me
to
set
down
long
afterwards
i
said
reconsidering
the
foregoing
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
underestimated
the
danger
signs
on
the
on
february
and
on
the
following
day
might
have
attached
more
importance
to
the
safety
of
my
companions
as
it
was
however
all
circumstances
seemed
to
conspire
together
to
make
the
situation
unavoidable
i
did
not
forget
to
mention
the
splendid
behaviour
of
cherry
and
crean
and
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
regrets
i
took
the
blame
for
my
lack
of
experience
but
knew
that
having
done
everything
i
could
do
it
did
not
concern
me
if
anybody
liked
to
criticize
my
action
my
own
opinion
is
that
it
just
had
to
be
the
circumstances
leading
to
it
were
too
devious
for
mere
coincidence
six
hours
earlier
we
could
have
walked
to
the
hut
on
sound
a
few
hours
later
we
should
have
seen
open
water
on
arrival
at
the
barrier
edge
the
blizzard
that
knocked
out
the
beasts
the
death
of
weary
the
misunderstanding
of
the
dogs
everything
fitted
in
to
place
us
on
the
during
the
only
two
hours
of
the
whole
year
that
we
could
possibly
have
been
in
such
a
position
let
those
who
believe
in
coincidence
carry
on
believing
nobody
will
ever
convince
me
that
there
was
not
something
more
perhaps
in
the
light
of
next
year
we
shall
see
what
was
meant
by
such
an
apparent
blow
to
our
hopes
certainly
we
shall
start
for
the
pole
with
less
of
that
foolish
spirit
of
blatant
boast
and
ridiculous
blind
that
characterized
some
of
us
on
leaving
cardiff
poor
captain
scott
had
now
a
new
anxiety
thrust
upon
him
the
winter
station
with
ponies
stores
and
motors
was
all
situated
on
a
low
beach
not
twenty
yards
from
the
water
edge
and
now
that
the
ice
had
gone
out
and
the
hut
was
not
six
feet
above
at
the
floor
how
had
they
fared
in
the
storm
this
was
a
problem
we
could
not
solve
without
going
to
see
cape
evans
though
dimly
in
sight
was
as
far
off
as
new
zealand
till
the
sea
froze
over
the
idea
of
attempting
the
shoulder
of
erebus
did
occur
to
captain
scott
but
it
was
so
heavily
crevassed
as
to
make
a
journey
from
our
side
almost
impossible
on
the
other
side
professor
david
party
got
up
to
the
summit
without
finding
a
crevasse
captain
scott
took
his
reverses
like
a
brick
i
often
went
out
for
a
walk
with
him
and
sometimes
he
discussed
his
plans
for
next
season
he
took
his
losses
very
philosophically
and
never
blamed
any
of
us
this
is
the
end
of
that
part
of
bowers
letter
which
deals
with
the
incident
crean
told
me
afterwards
how
he
got
on
to
the
barrier
he
first
made
for
the
gap
following
the
best
path
of
the
ice
but
then
had
to
retrace
his
steps
and
make
for
white
island
jumping
from
floe
to
floe
but
then
i
was
pretty
lively
said
he
and
there
were
lots
of
penguins
and
seals
and
killers
knocking
round
that
day
crean
had
one
of
the
ski
sticks
and
that
was
a
great
help
to
me
for
getting
over
the
floes
it
was
a
sloping
piece
like
what
you
were
on
and
it
was
very
near
touching
the
barrier
in
one
corner
of
it
only
well
i
dug
a
hole
with
the
ski
stick
in
the
side
of
the
barrier
for
a
step
for
one
foot
and
when
i
finished
the
hole
i
straddled
my
legs
and
got
one
on
the
floe
and
one
in
the
side
of
the
barrier
then
i
got
the
stick
and
dug
it
in
on
top
and
i
gave
myself
a
bit
of
a
spring
and
got
my
outside
leg
up
top
it
was
a
terrible
place
but
i
thought
it
was
the
only
chance
i
made
straight
for
safety
camp
and
they
must
have
spotted
me
for
i
think
it
was
gran
that
met
me
on
skis
then
scott
and
wilson
and
oates
met
me
a
long
way
out
i
explained
how
it
happened
he
was
a
bit
but
he
never
said
anything
out
of
the
way
he
told
oates
to
go
inside
and
light
the
primus
and
give
me
a
meal
a
more
detailed
account
of
the
behaviour
of
the
hundreds
of
whales
which
infested
the
lanes
of
open
water
between
the
broken
floes
and
calved
bergs
is
of
interest
most
of
them
at
any
rate
were
killer
whales
orca
gladiator
and
they
were
cruising
about
in
great
numbers
snorting
and
blowing
while
occasionally
they
would
in
some
extraordinary
way
raise
themselves
and
look
about
over
the
ice
resting
the
fore
part
of
their
enormous
yellow
and
black
bodies
on
the
edge
of
the
floes
they
were
undisguisedly
interested
in
us
and
the
ponies
and
we
felt
that
if
we
once
got
into
the
water
our
ends
would
be
swift
and
bloody
but
i
have
a
very
distinct
recollection
that
the
whales
were
not
all
killers
and
that
some
at
any
rate
were
whales
this
was
impressed
upon
me
by
one
of
the
most
dramatic
moments
of
that
night
and
day
we
made
our
way
very
slowly
sometimes
waiting
twenty
minutes
for
the
floe
on
which
we
were
to
touch
the
next
one
in
the
direction
we
were
trying
to
go
but
before
us
in
the
distance
was
a
region
of
which
appeared
to
slope
gradually
up
on
to
the
fast
barrier
beyond
as
we
got
nearer
we
saw
a
dark
line
appear
at
intervals
between
the
two
this
we
considered
was
a
crevasse
at
the
edge
of
the
barrier
which
was
opening
and
shutting
with
the
very
big
swell
which
was
running
and
on
which
all
the
floes
were
bobbing
up
and
down
we
told
one
another
that
we
could
rush
the
ponies
over
this
as
it
closed
we
approached
the
barrier
and
began
to
rise
up
on
the
sloping
floes
which
had
edged
the
barrier
and
so
on
to
small
bergs
which
had
calved
from
the
barrier
itself
leaving
crean
with
the
ponies
bowers
and
i
went
forward
to
prospect
and
rose
on
to
a
berg
from
which
we
hoped
to
reach
the
barrier
i
can
never
forget
the
scene
that
met
us
between
us
and
the
barrier
was
a
lane
of
some
fifty
yards
wide
a
seething
cauldron
bergs
were
calving
off
as
we
watched
and
capsizing
and
hitting
other
bergs
splitting
into
two
and
falling
apart
the
killers
filled
the
whole
place
looking
downwards
into
a
hole
between
our
berg
and
the
next
a
hole
not
bigger
than
a
small
room
we
saw
at
least
six
whales
they
were
so
crowded
that
they
could
only
lie
so
as
to
get
their
snouts
out
of
the
water
and
my
memory
is
that
their
snouts
were
at
this
moment
our
berg
split
into
two
parts
and
we
hastily
retreated
to
the
lower
and
safer
floes
now
in
the
zoological
report
of
the
discovery
expedition
wilson
states
that
the
true
identity
of
the
whale
hyperoodon
rostrata
in
antarctic
seas
has
not
been
conclusively
established
but
that
inasmuch
as
it
certainly
frequents
seas
so
far
as
latitude
it
is
probable
that
certain
whales
which
he
and
other
members
of
that
expedition
saw
frequenting
the
edge
of
the
ice
were
as
they
appeared
to
be
whales
for
my
part
without
great
knowledge
of
whales
i
am
convinced
that
these
whales
which
lay
but
twenty
feet
below
us
were
whales
of
this
species
after
our
rescue
by
scott
we
pitched
our
tents
as
has
been
described
at
least
half
a
mile
from
the
fast
edge
of
the
barrier
all
night
long
or
as
it
really
was
early
morning
the
killers
were
snorting
and
blowing
under
the
barrier
and
sometimes
it
seemed
under
our
tents
time
and
again
some
member
of
the
party
went
out
of
the
tent
to
see
if
the
barrier
had
not
broken
farther
back
but
there
was
no
visible
change
and
it
must
have
been
that
the
apparently
solid
ice
on
which
we
were
was
split
up
by
crevasses
by
the
big
swell
which
had
been
running
and
that
round
us
hidden
by
snow
bridges
were
leads
of
water
in
which
whales
were
cruising
in
search
of
seal
the
next
day
most
of
the
ice
had
gone
out
to
sea
and
i
do
not
think
the
whales
were
so
numerous
the
most
noticeable
thing
about
them
that
day
was
the
organization
shown
by
the
band
of
whales
which
appeared
after
bowers
pony
uncle
bill
had
fallen
between
two
floes
and
we
were
trying
to
get
him
towards
the
barrier
good
god
look
at
the
whales
said
some
one
and
there
in
a
pool
of
water
behind
the
floe
on
which
we
were
working
lay
twelve
great
whales
in
perfect
line
facing
the
floe
and
out
in
front
of
them
like
the
captain
of
a
company
of
soldiers
was
another
as
we
turned
they
dived
as
one
whale
led
by
the
big
fellow
in
front
and
we
certainly
expected
that
they
would
attack
the
floe
on
which
we
stood
whether
they
never
did
so
or
whether
they
tried
and
failed
for
the
floes
here
were
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
thick
i
do
not
know
we
never
saw
them
again
one
other
incident
of
those
days
is
worth
recalling
cherry
crean
we
floating
out
to
sea
was
the
startling
awakening
from
bowers
standing
in
his
socks
outside
the
tent
at
that
wednesday
morning
and
indeed
at
first
sight
on
getting
outside
the
tent
it
looked
a
quite
hopeless
situation
i
thought
it
was
madness
to
try
and
save
the
ponies
and
gear
when
it
seemed
the
only
chance
at
all
of
saving
the
men
was
an
immediate
rush
for
the
barrier
and
i
said
so
well
i
going
to
try
was
bowers
answer
and
quixotic
or
no
he
largely
succeeded
i
never
knew
a
man
who
treated
difficulties
with
such
scorn
there
must
be
some
of
my
companions
who
look
back
upon
hut
point
with
a
peculiar
fondness
such
as
men
get
for
places
where
they
have
experienced
great
joys
and
great
trials
and
hut
point
has
an
atmosphere
of
its
own
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
partly
aesthetic
for
the
sea
and
great
mountains
and
the
glorious
colour
effects
which
prevail
in
spring
and
autumn
would
fascinate
the
least
imaginative
partly
mysterious
with
the
great
barrier
knocking
at
your
door
and
the
smoke
of
erebus
by
day
and
the
curtain
of
aurora
by
night
partly
the
associations
of
the
place
the
old
hut
the
old
landmarks
so
familiar
to
those
who
know
the
history
of
the
discovery
expedition
the
stakes
in
the
snow
the
holes
for
which
ice
was
dug
to
water
the
ship
vince
cross
on
the
point
now
there
is
another
cross
on
observation
hill
and
yet
when
we
first
arrived
the
hut
was
comfortless
enough
wilson
and
meares
and
gran
had
been
there
some
days
they
had
found
some
old
bricks
and
a
grid
and
there
was
an
open
blubber
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
was
no
outlet
for
the
smoke
and
smuts
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
your
neighbour
to
speak
without
coughing
or
to
open
your
eyes
long
before
they
began
to
smart
atkinson
and
crean
had
cleared
the
floor
of
ice
in
our
absence
but
the
space
between
the
lower
and
upper
roofs
was
solid
with
blue
ice
and
the
lower
roof
sagged
down
in
places
in
a
dangerous
way
the
wind
howled
continuously
and
to
say
that
the
hut
was
cold
is
a
very
mild
expression
of
the
reality
this
hut
was
built
by
the
discovery
expedition
who
themselves
lived
in
the
ship
which
lay
off
the
shore
frozen
into
the
as
a
workroom
and
as
a
refuge
in
case
of
shipwreck
it
was
useful
to
them
in
some
ways
but
was
too
large
to
heat
with
the
amount
of
coal
available
and
was
rather
a
white
elephant
scott
wrote
of
it
that
on
the
whole
our
large
hut
has
been
and
will
be
of
use
to
us
but
its
uses
are
never
likely
to
be
of
such
importance
as
to
render
it
indispensable
nor
cause
it
to
be
said
that
circumstances
have
justified
the
outlay
made
on
it
or
the
expenditure
of
space
and
trouble
in
bringing
it
to
its
final
home
it
is
here
now
however
and
here
it
will
stand
for
many
a
long
year
with
such
supplies
as
will
afford
the
necessaries
of
life
to
any
less
fortunate
party
who
may
follow
in
our
footsteps
and
be
forced
to
search
for
food
and
shelter
well
it
was
to
be
more
useful
to
scott
in
to
than
he
imagined
in
we
found
the
place
with
its
verandah
complete
the
remains
of
the
two
magnetic
huts
and
a
rubbish
heap
it
was
wonderful
what
that
rubbish
heap
yielded
up
bricks
to
build
a
blubber
stove
a
sheet
of
iron
to
put
over
the
top
of
it
a
length
of
stove
piping
to
form
a
chimney
somehow
somebody
made
cement
and
built
the
bricks
together
and
one
of
the
magnetic
huts
gave
up
its
asbestos
sheeting
to
insulate
the
chimney
from
the
woodwork
of
the
roofs
an
old
door
made
a
cook
table
old
cases
turned
upside
down
made
seats
the
provisions
left
by
the
discovery
were
biscuits
contained
in
some
forty
large
packing
cases
these
we
piled
up
across
the
middle
of
our
house
as
a
bulkhead
and
the
old
discovery
winter
awning
was
dug
out
of
the
snow
outside
and
fixed
against
the
wall
thus
made
to
keep
the
warmth
in
at
night
we
cleared
the
floor
space
and
spread
our
bags
illustration
hut
point
from
observation
hill
the
two
precious
survivors
of
the
eight
ponies
with
which
we
started
on
our
journey
were
housed
in
the
verandah
which
was
made
and
the
more
truculent
dogs
lay
tethered
outside
the
more
docile
were
allowed
their
freedom
but
even
so
the
dog
fights
were
not
infrequent
we
had
one
poor
little
dog
makaka
by
name
when
unloading
the
ship
this
dog
had
been
overrun
by
the
sledge
which
he
was
helping
to
pull
he
suffered
again
when
the
team
of
dogs
fell
down
the
crevasse
and
was
now
partially
paralysed
he
was
a
wretched
object
for
the
hair
refused
to
grow
on
his
hind
quarters
but
he
was
a
real
sportsman
and
had
no
idea
of
giving
in
meares
and
i
went
out
one
night
when
it
was
blowing
hard
attracted
by
the
cries
of
a
dog
it
was
makaka
who
had
ventured
to
climb
a
steep
slope
and
was
now
afraid
to
return
when
the
dogs
finally
returned
to
cape
evans
makaka
was
allowed
to
run
by
the
side
of
the
team
but
when
cape
evans
was
reached
he
was
gone
search
failed
to
find
him
and
after
some
weeks
hope
of
him
was
abandoned
but
a
month
afterwards
gran
and
debenham
went
over
to
hut
point
and
here
at
the
entrance
of
the
hut
they
found
makaka
pitifully
weak
but
able
to
bark
to
them
he
must
have
lived
on
seal
but
how
he
did
so
in
that
condition
is
a
mystery
the
reader
may
ask
how
it
was
that
being
so
near
our
winter
quarters
at
cape
evans
we
were
unable
to
reach
them
immediately
cape
evans
is
fifteen
miles
across
the
sea
from
hut
point
and
though
both
huts
are
on
the
same
island
hut
point
being
at
the
end
of
a
peninsula
and
cape
evans
on
the
remains
of
a
flow
of
lava
which
juts
out
into
the
sea
the
land
which
joins
the
two
has
never
yet
been
crossed
by
a
sledge
party
owing
to
the
great
ice
falls
which
cover
the
slopes
of
erebus
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
that
although
hut
point
is
surrounded
with
sea
or
on
every
side
except
that
of
arrival
heights
the
barrier
abuts
upon
the
hut
point
peninsula
to
the
south
beyond
pram
point
thus
there
is
always
communication
with
the
barrier
by
a
devious
route
by
which
indeed
we
had
just
arrived
but
farther
progress
north
is
cut
off
until
the
cold
temperature
of
the
autumn
and
winter
causes
the
open
sea
to
freeze
we
arrived
at
hut
point
on
march
and
scott
expected
to
be
able
to
cross
on
the
ice
by
about
march
however
it
was
nearly
a
month
after
that
when
the
first
party
could
pass
to
cape
evans
and
then
only
the
bays
were
frozen
and
the
sound
was
still
open
water
owing
to
the
winds
which
swept
the
ice
out
to
sea
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
formed
on
the
top
of
all
the
anxieties
which
had
oppressed
him
lately
scott
had
a
great
fear
that
a
swell
so
phenomenal
as
to
break
up
glacier
tongue
a
landmark
which
had
probably
been
there
for
centuries
might
have
swept
away
our
hut
at
cape
evans
he
was
so
alarmed
about
it
that
he
told
wilson
and
myself
to
prepare
to
form
a
sledging
party
with
him
to
penetrate
the
erebus
icefalls
and
reach
cape
evans
went
yesterday
to
castle
rock
with
wilson
to
see
what
chance
there
might
be
of
getting
to
cape
evans
the
day
was
bright
and
it
was
quite
warm
walking
in
the
sun
there
is
no
doubt
the
route
to
cape
evans
lies
over
the
worst
corner
of
erebus
from
this
distance
some
or
miles
at
least
the
whole
mountain
side
looks
a
mass
of
crevasses
but
a
route
might
be
found
at
a
level
of
or
feet
after
some
days
the
project
was
abandoned
as
being
hopeless
on
march
bowers
led
a
party
to
bring
in
the
gear
and
provisions
which
had
been
left
at
disaster
camp
the
material
that
is
which
had
been
rescued
from
the
they
were
away
three
days
and
found
the
pulling
very
hard
at
the
corner
of
the
bay
the
barrier
was
buckled
into
round
ridges
which
took
a
couple
of
hours
to
cross
we
marched
for
some
time
alongside
an
enormous
crevasse
which
lay
like
a
street
near
us
i
examined
it
at
one
point
which
must
have
been
feet
wide
and
though
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
bottom
for
snow
cornices
it
was
undoubtedly
open
as
i
could
hear
a
seal
blowing
below
bowers
letter
describes
them
dragging
their
heavy
load
up
the
slope
to
castle
rock
it
took
us
all
the
morning
to
reach
saddle
camp
with
the
loads
in
two
journeys
i
found
a
steady
plod
up
a
steep
hill
without
spells
is
better
and
less
exhausting
than
a
rush
and
a
number
of
rests
this
theory
i
put
into
practice
with
great
success
i
do
know
whether
everybody
saw
eye
to
eye
with
me
over
the
idea
of
getting
to
the
top
without
a
spell
after
the
second
sledge
was
up
atkinson
said
mind
you
as
a
rule
but
there
are
times
when
i
positively
hate
you
defoe
could
have
written
another
robinson
crusoe
with
hut
point
instead
of
san
juan
fernandez
our
sledging
supplies
were
mostly
exhausted
and
we
depended
upon
the
seals
we
could
kill
for
food
fuel
and
light
we
were
smutty
as
sweeps
from
the
blubber
we
burned
and
a
more
crew
would
have
been
hard
to
find
we
spent
our
fine
days
killing
cutting
up
and
carrying
in
seal
when
we
could
find
them
or
climbing
the
various
interesting
hills
and
craters
which
abound
here
and
our
evenings
in
long
discussions
which
seldom
settled
anything
some
looked
after
dogs
and
others
after
ponies
some
made
geological
collections
others
sketched
the
wonderful
sunsets
but
before
and
above
all
we
ate
and
slept
we
must
have
spent
a
good
twelve
hours
asleep
in
our
bags
every
day
after
our
six
weeks
sledging
and
we
rested
perhaps
this
is
not
everybody
notion
of
a
very
good
time
but
it
was
good
enough
for
us
the
weddell
seal
which
frequents
the
seas
which
fringe
the
antarctic
continent
was
a
standby
for
most
of
our
wants
for
he
can
at
a
pinch
provide
not
only
meat
to
eat
fuel
for
your
fire
and
oil
for
your
lamp
but
also
leather
for
your
finnesko
and
an
antidote
to
scurvy
as
he
lies
out
on
the
a
great
ungainly
shape
nothing
short
of
an
actual
prod
will
persuade
him
to
take
much
notice
of
an
antarctic
explorer
even
then
he
is
as
likely
as
not
to
yawn
in
your
face
and
go
to
sleep
again
his
instincts
are
all
to
avoid
the
water
when
alarmed
for
he
knows
his
enemies
the
killer
whales
live
there
but
if
you
drive
him
into
the
water
he
is
transformed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
into
a
thing
of
beauty
and
grace
which
can
travel
and
turn
with
extreme
celerity
and
which
can
successfully
chase
the
fish
on
which
he
feeds
we
were
lucky
now
in
that
a
small
bay
of
about
an
acre
in
extent
still
remained
within
two
miles
of
us
at
a
corner
where
barrier
sea
and
land
meet
called
pram
point
by
scott
in
the
discovery
days
now
pram
point
during
the
summer
months
is
one
of
the
most
populous
seal
nurseries
in
mcmurdo
sound
in
this
neighbourhood
the
barrier
moving
slowly
towards
the
peninsula
buckles
the
into
pressure
ridges
as
the
trough
of
each
ridge
is
forced
downwards
so
in
summer
pools
of
sea
water
are
formed
in
which
the
seal
make
their
holes
and
among
these
ridges
they
lie
and
bask
in
the
sun
the
males
fight
their
battles
the
females
bring
forth
their
young
the
children
play
and
chase
their
tails
just
like
kittens
now
that
the
had
broken
up
many
seal
were
to
be
found
in
this
sheltered
corner
under
the
green
and
blue
of
crater
hill
if
you
go
seal
killing
you
want
a
big
stick
a
bayonet
a
flensing
knife
and
a
steel
any
big
stick
will
do
so
long
as
it
will
hit
the
seal
a
heavy
blow
on
the
nose
this
stuns
him
and
afterwards
mercifully
he
feels
no
more
the
bayonet
knife
which
should
be
fitted
into
a
handle
with
a
to
prevent
the
slipping
of
the
hand
down
on
to
the
blade
should
be
at
least
inches
long
without
the
handle
this
is
used
to
reach
the
seal
heart
our
flensing
knives
were
one
foot
long
including
the
handle
the
blades
were
seven
inches
long
by
inches
broad
some
were
pointed
and
others
round
and
i
do
not
know
which
was
best
the
handles
should
be
of
wood
as
being
warmer
to
hold
killing
and
cutting
up
seals
is
a
gruesome
but
very
necessary
business
and
the
provision
of
suitable
implements
is
humane
as
well
as
economic
in
time
and
labour
the
skin
is
first
cut
off
with
the
blubber
attached
the
meat
is
then
cut
from
the
skeleton
the
entrails
cleaned
out
the
liver
carefully
excised
the
whole
is
then
left
to
freeze
in
pieces
on
the
snow
which
are
afterwards
collected
as
lumps
the
carcass
can
be
cut
up
with
an
axe
when
needed
and
fed
to
the
dogs
nothing
except
entrails
was
wasted

lighting
was
literally
a
burning
question
i
do
not
know
that
any
lamp
was
better
than
a
tin
matchbox
fed
with
blubber
with
strands
of
lamp
wick
sticking
up
in
it
but
all
kinds
of
patterns
big
and
small
were
made
by
proud
inventors
they
generally
gave
some
light
though
not
a
brilliant
one
there
were
more
ambitious
attempts
than
blubber
the
worst
of
these
perhaps
was
produced
by
oates
somebody
found
some
carbide
and
oates
immediately
schemed
to
light
the
hut
with
acetylene
i
think
he
was
the
only
person
who
did
not
view
the
preparation
with
nervousness
however
wilson
took
the
situation
into
his
tactful
hands
for
several
days
oates
and
wilson
were
deep
in
the
acetylene
plant
scheme
and
then
apparently
without
reason
it
was
found
that
it
could
not
be
done
it
was
a
successful
piece
of
strategy
which
no
woman
could
have
bettered
bowers
wilson
atkinson
and
i
were
on
crater
hill
one
morning
when
we
espied
a
sledge
party
approaching
from
the
direction
of
castle
rock
as
we
expected
this
was
the
geological
party
consisting
of
griffith
taylor
wright
debenham
and
seaman
evans
home
from
the
western
mountains
they
entirely
failed
to
recognize
in
our
black
faces
the
men
whom
they
had
last
seen
from
the
ship
at
glacier
tongue
i
hope
their
story
will
be
told
by
debenham
for
days
their
doings
were
the
topic
of
conversation
both
numerically
and
intellectually
they
were
an
addition
to
our
party
which
now
numbered
sixteen
taylor
especially
is
seldom
at
a
loss
for
conversation
and
his
remarks
are
generally
original
if
sometimes
crude
most
of
us
were
glad
to
listen
when
the
discussions
in
which
he
was
a
leading
figure
raged
round
the
blubber
stove
scott
and
wilson
were
always
in
the
thick
of
it
and
the
others
chimed
in
as
their
interest
knowledge
and
experience
led
rash
statements
on
questions
of
fact
were
always
dangerous
for
our
small
community
contained
so
many
specialists
that
errors
were
soon
exposed
at
the
same
time
there
were
few
parts
of
the
world
that
one
or
other
of
us
had
not
visited
at
least
once
later
when
we
came
to
our
own
limited
quarters
books
of
reference
were
constantly
in
demand
to
settle
disputes
such
books
as
the
times
atlas
a
good
encyclopaedia
and
even
a
latin
dictionary
are
invaluable
to
such
expeditions
for
this
purpose
to
them
i
would
add
who
who
from
odd
corners
we
unearthed
some
contemporary
reviews
the
girls
own
paper
and
the
family
herald
all
of
ten
years
ago
we
also
found
encased
in
ice
an
incomplete
copy
of
stanley
weyman
my
lady
rotha
it
was
carefully
thawed
out
and
read
by
everybody
and
the
excitement
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
end
of
the
book
was
missing
who
going
to
cook
was
one
of
the
last
queries
each
night
and
two
men
would
volunteer
it
is
not
great
fun
lighting
an
ordinary
coal
fire
on
a
cold
winter
morning
but
lighting
the
blubber
fire
at
hut
point
when
the
metal
frosted
your
fingers
and
the
frozen
blubber
had
to
be
induced
to
drip
was
a
far
more
arduous
task
the
water
was
converted
from
its
icy
state
and
by
that
time
the
stove
was
getting
hot
in
inverse
proportion
to
your
temper
seal
liver
fry
and
cocoa
with
unlimited

cabin
biscuits
were
the
standard
dish
for
breakfast
and
when
it
was
ready
a
sustained
cry
of
brought
the
sleepers
from
their
bags
wiping
reindeer
hairs
from
their
eyes
i
think
i
was
responsible
for
the
greatest
breakfast
failure
when
i
fried
some
biscuits
and
sardines
we
only
had
one
tin
leaving
the
biscuits
in
the
frying
pan
the
lid
of
a
cooker
after
taking
it
from
the
fire
they
went
on
cooking
and
became
as
charcoal
this
meal
was
known
as
on
april
bowers
prepared
to
make
a
fool
of
two
of
us
by
putting
chaff
in
our
pannikins
and
covering
the
top
only
with
seal
meat
the
plan
turned
back
upon
the
maker
for
he
had
not
enough
left
to
make
up
the
deficiency
and
as
i
found
out
many
weeks
afterwards
surreptitiously
gave
up
his
own
hoosh
to
the
april
fools
and
went
without
himself
of
such
are
the
small
incidents
which
afforded
real
amusement
and
even
live
in
the
memory
as
outstanding
features
of
our
existence
breakfast

was
a
general
one

for

a

axe
from
the
general
store
of
seal
meat
fids
of
sealskin
with
the
blubber
attached
a
good
three
inches
of
it
perhaps
were
brought
in
and
placed
by
the
stove
much
as
we
bring
in
a
scuttle
of
coal
gradually
the
community
scattered
as
duty
or
inclination
led
leaving
some
members
to
dig
away
the
which
had
accumulated
round
the
door
and
windows
during
the
night
by
lunch
time
every
one
had
some
new
item
of
interest
wright
had
found
a
new
form
of
ice
crystal
scott
had
tested
the
ice
off
the
point
and
found
it
five
inches
thick
wilson
had
found
new
seal
holes
off
cape
armitage
and
we
had
hopes
of
finding
our
food
and
fuel
nearer
home
atkinson
had
killed
an
emperor
penguin
which
weighed
over
ninety
pounds
a
record
and
the
assistant
zoologist
felt
he
would
have
to
skin
it
and
did
not
want
to
do
so
meares
had
found
an
excellent
place
to
roll
stones
down
arrival
heights
into
the
sea
debenham
had
a
new
theory
to
account
for
the
great
boulder
as
a
mammoth
block
different
in
structure
from
the
surrounding
geological
features
was
called
bowers
had
a
scheme
for
returning
from
the
pole
by
the
plateau
instead
of
the
barrier
oates
might
be
heard
saying
that
he
thought
he
could
do
with
another
chupattie
a
favourite
pastime
was
the
making
of
knots
could
you
make
a
clove
hitch
with
one
hand
the
afternoon
was
like
the
morning
save
that
the
sun
was
now
sinking
behind
the
western
mountains
these
autumn
effects
were
among
the
most
beautiful
sights
of
the
world
and
it
was
now
that
wilson
made
the
sketches
for
many
of
the
which
he
afterwards
painted
at
winter
quarters
the
majority
were
taken
from
the
summit
of
observation
hill
crouching
under
the
lee
of
the
rocks
into
which
nearly
two
years
after
we
built
the
cross
which
now
stands
to
commemorate
his
death
and
that
of
his
companions
he
sketched
quickly
with
bare
fingers
and
mittened
hands
jotting
down
the
outlines
of
hills
and
clouds
and
pencilling
in
the
colours
by
name
after
a
minute
more
or
less
the
fingers
become
too
cold
for
such
work
and
they
must
be
put
back
into
the
wool
and
fur
mitts
until
they
are
again
warm
enough
to
continue
pencil
and
sketch
book
a
winsor
and
newton
were
carried
in
a
little
wallet
on
his
belt
scott
carried
his
sledge
diaries
in
similar
books
in
a
similar
wallet
made
of
green
willesden
canvas
and
fastened
with
a
lanyard
there
was
a
good
fug
in
the
hut
by
dinner
time
this
was
a
mixed
blessing
it
was
good
for
our
gear
finnesko
mitts
socks
were
all
hung
up
and
dried
most
necessary
after
sledging
and
most
important
for
the
preservation
of
the
skins
but
it
also
started
the
most
infernal
from
the
roof
i
have
spoken
of
the
double
roof
of
the
old
discovery
hut
this
was
still
full
of
solid
ice
indeed
some
time
afterwards
a
large
portion
of
it
fell
but
luckily
the
inhabitants
were
outside
the
immediate
problem
was
to
prevent
the
leaks
falling
on
ourselves
our
food
or
our
clothing
and
bags
and
so
every
tin
was
brought
into
use
and
hung
from
leaky
spots
while
water
chutes
came
into
their
own
as
the
stove
cooled
so
did
the
drip
cease
and
in
no
prehistoric
cavern
did
more
stalactites
and
stalagmites
grow
apace
on
march
the
last
sledge
party
to
the
barrier
that
season
started
for
corner
camp
with
provisions
to
increase
the
existing
depôt
there
the
party
was
in
charge
of
lieutenant
evans
and
consisted
of
bowers
oates
atkinson
wright
and
myself
with
two
seamen
crean
and
forde
the
journey
out
and
back
took
eight
days
and
was
uneventful
as
sledge
journeys
go
thick
weather
prevailed
for
several
days
and
after
running
down
our
distance
to
corner
camp
we
waited
for
it
to
clear
we
found
ourselves
six
miles
from
the
depôt
and
among
crevasses
which
goes
to
show
how
easy
it
is
to
steer
off
the
course
under
such
conditions
and
how
creditable
the
navigation
is
when
a
course
is
kept
correctly
sometimes
more
by
instinct
than
by
skill
but
we
got
our
first
experience
of
cold
weather
sledging
which
was
useful
the
minus
thirties
and
forties
are
not
very
cold
as
we
were
to
understand
cold
afterwards
but
quite
cold
enough
to
start
with
cold
enough
to
teach
you
how
to
look
after
your
footgear
handle
metal
and
not
to
waste
time
however
the
sun
was
still
well
up
during
the
day
and
this
makes
all
the
difference
since
any
sun
does
more
drying
of
clothes
and
gear
than
none
at
all
at
the
same
time
we
began
to
realize
the
difficulties
which
attend
upon
spring
journeys
though
we
could
only
imagine
what
might
be
the
trials
on
a
journey
in
such
as
we
intended
to
essay
it
is
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event
but
in
looking
back
upon
the
expedition
as
a
whole
and
the
tragedy
which
was
to
come
mainly
from
the
unforeseen
cold
of
the
autumn
on
the
barrier
such
as
minus
forties
in
february
it
seems
that
we
might
have
grasped
that
these
temperatures
were
lower
than
might
have
been
expected
in
the
middle
of
march
quite
near
the
open
sea
even
if
this
had
occurred
to
any
one
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
did
i
doubt
whether
the
next
step
of
reasoning
would
have
followed
namely
the
possibility
that
the
interior
of
the
barrier
would
as
actually
happened
prove
to
be
much
colder
than
was
expected
at
this
date
on
the
contrary
i
several
times
heard
scott
mention
the
possibility
of
the
polar
party
not
returning
until
april
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
realized
that
pony
transport
to
the
foot
of
the
beardmore
glacier
made
a
late
start
inevitable
for
the
blizzards
our
ponies
had
already
suffered
proved
that
spring
weather
on
the
barrier
would
be
intolerable
to
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
scott
says
in
his
message
to
the
public
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
expected
the
temperature
and
surfaces
which
we
encountered
at
this
time
of
the
year
we
returned
to
find
everything
at
hut
point
including
the
hut
covered
with
frozen
spray
this
was
the
result
of
a
blizzard
of
which
we
only
felt
the
tail
end
on
the
barrier
scott
wrote
the
sea
was
breaking
constantly
and
heavily
on
the
ice
foot
the
spray
carried
right
over
the
point
covering
all
things
and
raining
on
the
roof
of
the
hut
poor
vince
cross
some
feet
above
the
water
was
enveloped
in
it
of
course
the
dogs
had
a
very
poor
time
and
we
went
and
released
two
or
three
getting
covered
in
spray
during
the
operation
our
wind
clothes
very
wet
this
is
the
third
gale
from
the
south
since
our
arrival
here
in
weeks
any
one
of
these
would
have
rendered
the
bay
impossible
for
a
ship
and
therefore
it
is
extraordinary
that
we
should
have
entirely
escaped
such
a
blow
when
the
discovery
was
in
it
in
it
is
difficult
to
see
long
distances
across
open
water
at
this
time
of
year
because
the
comparatively
warm
water
throws
up
into
the
air
a
fog
known
as
if
there
is
a
wind
this
smoke
is
carried
over
the
surface
of
the
sea
but
if
calm
the
smoke
rises
and
forms
a
dense
curtain
standing
on
arrival
heights
which
form
the
nail
of
the
peninsula
on
which
we
now
lived
we
could
see
the
four
islands
which
lie
near
cape
evans
and
a
black
smudge
in
the
face
of
the
glaciers
which
descend
from
erebus
which
we
knew
to
be
the
face
of
the
steep
slope
above
cape
evans
afterwards
named
the
ramp
but
for
the
present
our
comfortable
hut
might
have
been
thousands
of
miles
away
for
all
the
good
it
was
to
us
as
soon
as
the
wind
fell
calm
the
sea
was
covered
by
a
thin
layer
of
ice
in
hours
it
might
be
four
or
five
inches
thick
but
as
yet
it
never
proved
strong
enough
to
resist
the
next
blizzard
in
march
the
ice
to
the
south
was
safe
there
was
appearance
of
ice
in
the
two
bays
at
the
foot
of
erebus
slopes
in
the
beginning
of
april
we
treated
newly
formed
ice
with
far
too
little
respect
it
was
on
april
that
scott
asked
whether
any
of
us
would
like
to
walk
northwards
over
the
newly
formed
ice
towards
castle
rock
we
had
walked
about
two
miles
the
ice
heaving
up
and
down
as
we
went
dodging
the
open
pools
and
leads
to
the
best
of
our
ability
when
taylor
went
right
in
luckily
he
could
lever
himself
out
without
help
and
returned
to
the
hut
with
all
speed
we
prepared
to
cross
this
ice
to
cape
evans
the
next
day
but
the
whole
of
it
went
out
in
the
night
on
another
occasion
we
were
prepared
to
set
out
the
following
morning
but
the
ice
on
which
we
were
to
cross
went
out
on
the
turn
of
the
tide
some
five
hours
before
we
timed
ourselves
to
start
scott
was
of
opinion
that
the
ice
in
the
two
bays
under
erebus
was
firm
and
prepared
to
essay
this
route
the
first
of
these
bays
is
formed
by
the
junction
of
the
hut
point
peninsula
with
erebus
to
the
south
and
by
glacier
tongue
to
the
north
crossing
glacier
tongue
a
party
can
descend
on
to
the
second
bay
beyond
the
northern
boundary
of
which
is
cape
evans
the
dellbridge
islands
of
which
great
razorback
is
in
direct
line
between
glacier
tongue
and
cape
evans
help
to
hold
in
any
ice
which
forms
here
the
route
had
never
been
attempted
before
but
it
was
hoped
that
a
way
down
from
the
peninsula
on
to
the
frozen
sea
might
be
found
at
the
hutton
cliffs
an
outcrop
of
lava
rock
in
the
irregular
ice
face
a
party
consisting
of
scott
bowers
taylor
and
seaman
evans
with
one
tent
and
lieutenant
evans
wright
debenham
gran
and
crean
with
another
started
for
hut
point
it
was
dark
to
the
south
and
snowing
by
the
time
they
reached
the
top
of
ski
slope
we
helped
them
past
third
crater
the
ice
from
hut
point
to
glacier
tongue
was
impossible
and
so
they
went
on
past
castle
rock
and
were
to
try
and
get
down
somewhere
by
the
hutton
cliffs
on
to
some
fast
which
seemed
to
have
held
there
some
time
and
so
across
glacier
tongue
on
to
which
also
seemed
to
be
fast
as
far
as
cape
evans
after
lunch
wilson
and
i
started
about
in
half
a
blizzard
it
was
much
better
on
the
heights
and
fairly
clear
towards
erebus
but
we
could
not
see
any
traces
of
the
party
on
the
ice
april
this
morning
as
it
was
beginning
to
get
light
a
blizzard
started
and
it
is
blowing
very
hard
now
the
large
amount
of
snow
which
has
fallen
will
make
it
very
thick
we
are
all
anxious
about
the
returning
party
for
scott
talked
of
camping
on
the
the
ice
in
arrival
bay
just
north
of
hut
point
has
gone
out
they
have
food
for
two
meals
and
a
full
primus
for
each
tent
april
we
were
very
anxious
about
the
returning
party
especially
when
all
the
ice
north
of
hut
point
went
out
the
blizzard
blew
itself
out
this
morning
and
it
was
a
great
change
to
see
white
island
and
the
bluff
once
more
atkinson
came
in
before
lunch
and
told
me
that
looking
from
the
heights
the
ice
from
glacier
tongue
to
cape
evans
appeared
to
have
gone
out
this
sobered
our
lunch
we
all
made
our
way
to
second
crater
afterwards
and
found
the
ice
from
the
hutton
cliffs
to
glacier
tongue
and
thence
to
cape
evans
was
still
in
before
leaving
scott
arranged
to
give
véry
lights
at
from
cape
evans
on
the
first
clear
night
of
the
next
three
is
the
third
and
the
first
clear
night
we
were
out
punctually
and
then
as
we
watched
a
flare
blazed
up
followed
by
quite
a
firework
display
we
all
went
wild
with
excitement
knowing
that
all
was
well
meares
ran
in
and
soaked
some
awning
with
paraffin
and
we
lifted
it
as
an
answering
flare
and
threw
it
into
the
air
again
and
again
until
it
was
burning
in
little
bits
all
over
the
snow
the
relief
was
great
bowers
must
tell
the
story
of
the
returning
party
we
topped
the
ridges
and
headed
for
erebus
beyond
castle
rock
it
looked
a
little
threatening
at
first
but
cleared
a
bit
as
we
got
on
it
was
quite
interesting
to
be
breaking
new
ground
scott
is
a
fine
stepper
in
a
sledge
and
he
set
a
fast
and
easy
swing
all
the
time
it
was
snowing
and
misty
when
we
got
beyond
the
hutton
cliffs
but
we
pitched
the
tents
for
lunch
before
going
down
the
slope
there
was
no
doubt
that
a
blizzard
was
coming
up
it
cleared
during
lunch
which
we
finished
about
as
it
had
been
a
long
morning
march
it
was
just
as
well
for
us
that
the
mist
cleared
for
the
slope
was
not
only
crevassed
in
one
direction
but
it
ended
in
a
high
by
working
along
we
found
a
lowish
place
about
thirty
feet
down
from
top
to
bottom
over
this
we
lowered
men
and
sledges
it
had
started
to
blow
and
the
drift
was
flying
off
the
cliff
in
clouds
we
put
in
a
couple
of
strong
male
bamboos
to
lower
the
last
man
away
leaving
the
alpine
rope
there
to
facilitate
ascent
for
any
party
returning
to
hut
point
with
food
we
then
repacked
the
sledges
and
headed
across
the
bay
towards
the
glacier
tongue
where
we
arrived
after
dark
about
the
young
was
covered
in
a
salt
deposit
which
made
it
like
pulling
a
sledge
over
treacle
instead
of
ice
and
it
was
very
heavy
going
after
the
snow
uplands
the
tongue
was
mostly
hard
blue
ice
which
is
slipperiness
itself
and
crevassed
every
few
yards
most
of
these
were
bridged
but
you
were
continually
pushing
a
foot
or
sometimes
two
into
nothingness
in
the
none
of
us
however
went
down
to
the
extent
of
our
harness
arrived
on
the
other
side
we
struck
a
sheltered
dip
where
we
decided
to
camp
for
something
to
eat
it
was
after
and
i
was
for
camping
there
for
the
night
as
it
seemed
to
me
folly
to
venture
upon
a
piece
of
untried
newly
frozen
in
inky
darkness
with
a
blizzard
coming
up
behind
us
against
this
of
course
we
were
only
five
miles
from
cape
evans
and
though
we
had
hardly
any
grub
with
us
not
having
anticipated
the
cliff
or
the
saltness
of
the
and
having
to
set
out
to
do
the
journey
in
one
day
i
thought
hunger
in
a
better
than
lying
out
in
a
blizzard
on
less
than
one
foot
of
young
ice
after
a
meal
we
started
off
at
in
a
snowy
mist
in
which
we
could
literally
see
nothing
it
had
fallen
calm
though
and
at
last
we
could
see
the
outline
of
the
nearest
of
the
dellbridge
islands
called
the
great
razorback
our
course
lay
for
a
smaller
island
ahead
called
the
little
razorback
as
we
neared
the
little
razorback
island
the
snow
hid
everything
in
fact
we
could
hardly
see
the
island
itself
when
we
were
right
under
it
it
was
impossible
to
go
wandering
on
so
we
had
after
all
to
camp
on
the
there
was
scarcely
any
snow
to
put
on
the
valances
of
the
tents
and
the
wet
salt
soaked
the
bags
and
you
knew
that
there
was
only
about
six
or
ten
inches
of
precarious
ice
between
you
and
the
black
waters
beneath
altogether
i
decided
that
i
for
one
would
lie
awake
in
such
an
insecure
camp
as
expected
the
blizzard
overtook
us
shortly
after
midnight
and
the
shrieking
of
the
wind
among
the
rocks
above
might
have
been
pretty
unpleasant
had
it
not
assured
me
that
we
were
still
close
to
the
island
and
not
moving
seaward
needless
to
say
i
said
that
i
was
sure
the
camp
was
as
safe
as
a
church
at
daylight
taylor
dived
out
and
in
until
the
wind
from
the
door
blew
out
the
ice
valance
and
the
next
moment
the
tent
closed
on
us
like
an
umbrella
we
would
never
have
spread
it
again
had
not
some
of
the
drift
settled
round
us
and
so
we
were
able
to
secure
it
after
an
hour
or
two
the
air
was
full
of
thick
drift
and
to
work
off
some
of
taylor
energy
i
said
we
might
climb
the
island
and
look
for
cape
evans
the
island
rose
up
straight
from
the
sea
at
a
sharp
angle
all
round
and
we
climbed
it
with
difficulty
on
the
top
we
saw
the
reason
of
its
name
as
it
was
absolutely
so
sharp
right
along
that
you
could
bestride
the
top
as
though
sitting
in
a
saddle
it
was
too
windy
sitting
up
there
to
be
pleasant
so
we
descended
having
seen
nothing
but
clouds
of
flying
snow
and
the
peak
of
inaccessible
island
at
the
bottom
of
the
weather
side
we
found
a
small
ledge
perfectly
flat
and
just
big
enough
to
take
two
tents
pitched
close
together
at
this
place
the
island
made
a
wind
buffer
and
it
was
practically
calm
though
the
blizzard
yelled
all
round
i
urged
captain
scott
to
camp
on
this
ledge
and
taylor
fizzled
for
making
for
cape
evans
so
scott
decided
to
ensure
taylor
safety
as
he
put
it
and
we
made
for
the
ledge
once
there
we
had
an
ideal
camp
on
good
hard
ground
and
no
wind
and
had
we
had
food
the
blizzard
might
have
lasted
a
week
for
aught
i
cared
illustration
the
hut
erebus
and
clouds
we
were
two
nights
there
and
on
the
morning
of
the
it
took
off
enough
for
us
to
head
for
home
we
saw
sunny
jim
simpson
observatory
on
the
hill
but
still
did
not
know
how
the
hut
had
fared
till
we
got
round
the
cape
into
north
bay
there
was
the
winter
station
all
intact
however
and
though
north
bay
had
only
just
frozen
in
it
was
strong
enough
to
bear
us
safely
somebody
saw
us
and
in
another
moment
the
hut
poured
out
her
little
party
consisting
of
sunny
jim
ponting
nelson
day
lashly
hooper
clissold
dimitri
and
anton
ponting
face
was
a
study
as
he
ran
up
he
failed
to
recognize
any
of
us
and
stopped
dead
with
a
blank
look
as
he
admitted
afterwards
he
thought
it
was
the
norwegian
expedition
for
the
space
of
a
moment
and
then
we
were
all
being
greeted
as
heartily
as
if
we
had
really
done
something
to
be
proud
of
the
motors
had
had
to
be
shifted
and
a
lot
of
gear
placed
higher
up
the
beach
but
the
water
had
never
reached
near
the
hut
so
all
was
well
inside
it
looked
tremendous
and
we
looked
at
our
grimy
selves
in
a
glass
for
the
first
time
for
three
months
no
wonder
ponting
did
not
recognize
the
ruffians
he
photographed
a
group
of
us
which
will
amuse
you
some
day
when
it
is
permissible
to
send
photos
we
ate
heartily
and
had
hot
baths
and
generally
civilized
ourselves
i
have
since
concluded
that
the
hut
is
the
finest
place
in
the
southern
hemisphere
but
then
i
could
not
shake
down
to
it
at
once
i
hankered
for
a
out
on
the
snow
or
for
the
blubbery
atmosphere
of
hut
point
i
expect
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
all
my
special
pals
bill
cherry
titus
and
atch
had
been
left
behind
we
found
eight
ponies
at
winter
quarters
in
the
stable
hackenschmidt
having
died
these
with
our
two
at
hut
point
left
us
with
ten
to
start
the
winter
with
i
at
once
looked
out
the
other
big
siberian
horse
that
had
been
a
pair
with
my
late
lamented
they
were
the
only
siberian
ponies
all
the
rest
being
manchurians
and
singled
him
out
for
myself
should
powers
that
be
be
willing
a
party
had
to
return
to
hut
point
with
some
provision
in
a
day
or
two
so
i
asked
to
go
captain
scott
had
decided
to
go
himself
but
said
he
would
be
very
pleased
if
i
would
go
too
so
it
being
a
fine
day
we
left
the
following
monday
the
two
teams
consisted
of
captain
scott
lashly
day
and
dimitri
with
one
tent
and
sledge
and
crean
hooper
nelson
and
myself
with
the
other
we
had
it
fine
as
far
as
the
glacier
tongue
and
then
along
came
the
cheery
old
south
wind
in
our
faces
we
crossed
the
tongue
and
struggled
against
this
till
we
could
camp
under
the
hutton
cliffs
where
we
got
some
shelter
all
of
us
had
our
faces
the
washing
and
shaving
having
made
mine
quite
tender
it
was
a
bit
of
a
job
getting
up
the
cliff
we
had
to
stand
on
top
of
a
pile
of
fallen
ice
and
hoist
a
sledge
on
to
our
shoulders
at
least
on
to
the
shoulders
of
the
tall
ones
this
just
touched
the
overhanging
cornice
a
cornice
of
snow
is
caused
by
continual
drift
over
a
sharp
edge
it
takes
all
sorts
of
fantastic
shapes
but
usually
hangs
over
like
this
looking
edgeways
it
looks
as
if
it
must
fall
down
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
usually
very
tough
indeed
in
this
case
steps
were
cut
in
it
with
an
ice
axe
from
our
extemporary
ladder
and
captain
scott
and
i
got
up
first
with
the
aid
of
a
rope
and
the
ladder
we
got
the
light
ones
up
first
and
hauled
up
the
gear
last
of
all
hanging
the
sledge
from
the
top
with
one
rope
enabled
the
last
two
to
struggle
up
it
assisted
by
a
rope
round
them
from
above
it
was
a
cold
job
and
more
occurred
in
two
of
our
novices
one
on
a
foot
and
the
other
on
a
finger
we
faced
the
blast
again
but
got
it
partially
behind
us
on
reaching
the
heights
we
camped
for
the
night
under
castle
rock
on
an
inclined
slope
it
calmed
down
to
a
glorious
night
with
a
low
temperature
crean
and
i
lay
head
down
hill
to
make
nelson
and
hooper
who
had
never
sledged
before
more
comfortable
as
a
result
crean
slipped
half
out
of
the
tent
and
let
in
a
cold
stream
of
air
under
the
valance
for
which
i
was
at
a
loss
to
account
until
the
morning
disclosed
him
thus
fast
asleep
of
course
it
takes
a
lot
to
worry
captain
scott
coxswain
we
arrived
at
hut
point
and
had
a
great
reception
there
chiefly
on
account
of
the
food
we
brought
particularly
the
sugar
we
had
been
living
on
some
paraffin
sugar
when
i
left
before
and
even
this
was
finished
the
next
day
we
stayed
there
to
kill
seals
cherry
and
i
skinned
one
and
then
went
for
a
walk
round
cape
armitage
it
was
blowing
big
guns
off
the
cape
fairly
fizzing
in
fact
we
went
as
far
as
pram
point
and
then
turned
coming
in
with
it
behind
us
i
only
had
a
thin
balaclava
and
my
ears
were
nearly
nipped
meanwhile
those
of
us
who
had
been
left
at
hut
point
with
the
ponies
and
dogs
journeyed
out
one
afternoon
to
safety
camp
to
get
some
more
bales
of
compressed
fodder
easter
sunday
we
spent
in
a
howling
blizzard
which
cleared
in
the
afternoon
sufficiently
to
see
a
golden
sun
sinking
into
a
sea
of
purple
and
drift
i
have
it
on
record
that
we
had
tinned
haddock
this
day
for
breakfast
made
by
oates
with
great
care
a
biscuit
and
cheese
hoosh
for
lunch
and
a
pemmican
fry
this
evening
followed
by
cocoa
with
a
tin
of
sweetened
nestlé
milk
in
it
truly
a
great
luxury
for
the
rest
we
mended
our
finnesko
and
read
bleak
house
meares
told
us
how
the
chinese
who
were
going
to
war
with
the
lolos
who
are
one
of
the
eighteen
tribes
on
the
borders
of
thibet
and
china
tied
the
lolo
hostage
to
a
bench
and
having
cut
his
throat
caught
the
blood
which
dripped
from
it
into
this
they
dipped
their
flag
and
then
cut
out
the
heart
and
liver
which
the
officers
ate
while
the
men
ate
the
rest
the
relief
party
arrived
on
april
we
had
spent
such
a
happy
week
just
the
seven
of
us
at
the
discovery
hut
that
i
think
glad
as
we
were
to
see
the
men
we
would
most
of
us
have
rather
been
left
undisturbed
and
i
expected
that
it
would
mean
that
we
should
have
to
move
homewards
as
it
turned
out
meares
is
to
be
left
in
charge
of
the
party
which
remains
namely
forde
and
keohane
of
the
old
stagers
and
nelson
day
lashly
and
dimitri
of
the
he
is
very
amusing
with
the
stores
and
is
evidently
afraid
that
the
food
which
has
just
been
brought
in
sugar
flour
chocolate
etc
will
all
be
eaten
up
by
those
who
have
brought
it
so
we
have
dampers
without
butter
and
a
minimum
of
chocolate
tuesday
and
tuesday
night
was
one
of
our
few
still
cold
days
nearly
minus
thirty
the
sea
northwards
from
hut
point
whence
the
ice
had
previously
all
gone
out
froze
nearly
five
inches
by
wednesday
when
we
got
three
more
seal
scott
was
evidently
thinking
that
on
thursday
when
we
were
to
start
we
might
go
by
the
all
the
way
when
suddenly
with
no
warning
it
silently
floated
out
to
sea
illustration
a
cornice
of
snow
the
following
two
teams
travelled
to
cape
evans
via
the
hutton
cliffs
on
april
team
scott
wilson
atkinson
crean
team
bowers
oates
hooper
it
was
blowing
hard
as
usual
at
the
hutton
cliffs
and
we
got
rather
when
lowering
the
sledges
on
to
the
the
sun
was
leaving
us
for
the
next
four
months
but
luckily
the
light
just
lasted
for
this
operation
though
not
for
the
subsequent
meal
which
we
hastily
ate
under
the
cliffs
nor
for
the
crossing
of
glacier
tongue
bowers
wrote
home
i
had
the
lighter
team
and
knowing
what
a
flier
captain
scott
is
i
took
care
to
have
the
new
sledge
myself
our
weights
were
nothing
and
the
difference
was
only
in
the
sledge
runners
but
it
made
all
the
difference
to
us
that
day
scott
fairly
legged
it
as
i
expected
and
we
came
along
gaily
behind
him
he
could
not
understand
it
when
the
pace
began
to
tell
more
on
his
heavy
team
than
on
us
after
lowering
down
the
sledges
over
the
cliffs
we
recovered
the
rope
we
had
left
in
the
first
place
and
then
struck
out
over
the
then
our
good
runners
told
so
much
that
i
owned
up
to
mine
being
the
better
sledge
and
offered
to
give
them
one
of
my
team
this
was
declined
but
after
we
crossed
the
tongue
captain
scott
said
he
would
like
to
change
sledges
at
the
little
razorback
at
any
time
over
this
stretch
we
could
have
run
away
from
his
team
and
once
they
got
our
sledge
they
started
that
game
on
us
we
expected
it
and
never
had
i
stepped
out
so
hard
before
we
had
been
marching
hard
for
nearly
hours
and
now
we
had
two
miles
spurt
to
do
and
we
should
have
stuck
it
bad
runners
and
all
had
we
had
smooth
ice
as
it
was
we
struck
a
belt
of
rough
ice
and
in
the
dark
we
all
stumbled
and
i
went
down
a
whack
that
nearly
knocked
me
out
this
was
not
noticed
fortunately
and
still
we
hung
on
to
the
end
of
their
sledge
while
i
turned
hot
and
cold
and
sick
and
went
through
the
various
symptoms
before
i
got
my
equilibrium
back
which
i
fortunately
did
while
legging
it
at
full
speed
they
started
to
go
ahead
soon
after
that
though
and
we
could
not
hold
our
own
although
we
were
close
to
the
cape
i
had
the
same
thing
happen
again
after
another
fall
but
we
stuck
it
round
the
cape
and
arrived
only
about
yards
behind
i
have
never
felt
so
done
and
so
was
my
team
of
course
we
need
not
have
raced
but
we
did
and
i
would
do
the
same
thing
every
time
titus
produced
a
mug
of
brandy
he
had
sharked
from
the
ship
and
we
all
lapped
it
up
with
avidity
the
other
team
were
just
about
laid
out
too
so
i
do
think
there
was
much
to
be
said
either
way
two
days
later
the
sun
appeared
for
the
last
time
for
four
months
looking
back
i
realized
two
things
that
sledging
at
any
rate
in
summer
and
autumn
was
a
much
less
terrible
ordeal
than
my
imagination
had
painted
it
and
that
those
hut
point
days
would
prove
some
of
the
happiest
in
my
life
just
enough
to
eat
and
keep
us
warm
no
more
no
frills
nor
trimmings
there
is
many
a
worse
and
more
elaborate
life
the
necessaries
of
civilization
were
luxuries
to
us
and
as
priestley
found
under
circumstances
compared
to
which
our
life
at
hut
point
was
a
sunday
school
treat
the
luxuries
of
civilization
satisfy
only
those
wants
which
they
themselves
create

the
first
winter
the
highest
object
that
human
beings
can
set
before
themselves
is
not
the
pursuit
of
any
such
chimera
as
the
annihilation
of
the
unknown
it
is
simply
the
unwearied
endeavour
to
remove
its
boundaries
a
little
further
from
our
little
sphere
of
huxley
and
so
we
came
back
to
our
comfortable
hut
whatever
merit
there
may
be
in
going
to
the
antarctic
once
there
you
must
not
credit
yourself
for
being
there
to
spend
a
year
in
the
hut
at
cape
evans
because
you
explore
is
no
more
laudable
than
to
spend
a
month
at
davos
because
you
have
consumption
or
to
spend
an
english
winter
at
the
berkeley
hotel
it
is
just
the
most
comfortable
thing
and
the
easiest
thing
to
do
under
the
circumstances
in
our
case
the
best
thing
was
not
at
all
bad
for
the
hut
as
arctic
huts
go
was
as
palatial
as
is
the
ritz
as
hotels
go
whatever
the
conditions
of
darkness
cold
and
wind
might
be
outside
there
was
comfort
and
warmth
and
good
cheer
within
and
there
was
a
mass
of
work
to
be
done
as
well
as
at
least
two
journeys
of
the
first
magnitude
ahead
when
scott
first
sat
down
at
his
little
table
at
winter
quarters
to
start
working
out
a
most
complicated
scheme
of
weights
and
averages
for
the
southern
journey
his
thoughts
were
gloomy
i
know
this
is
the
end
of
the
pole
he
said
to
me
when
he
pulled
us
off
the
bergs
after
the
had
broken
up
the
loss
of
six
ponies
out
of
the
eight
with
which
we
started
the
depôt
journey
the
increasing
emaciation
and
weakness
of
the
pony
transport
as
we
travelled
farther
on
the
barrier
the
arrival
of
the
dogs
after
their
rapid
journey
home
starved
rakes
which
looked
as
though
they
were
absolutely
done
these
were
not
cheerful
recollections
with
which
to
start
to
plan
a
journey
of
eighteen
hundred
miles
on
the
other
hand
we
had
ten
ponies
left
though
two
or
three
of
them
were
of
more
than
doubtful
quality
and
it
was
obvious
that
considerable
improvement
could
and
must
be
made
in
the
feeding
of
both
ponies
and
dogs
with
regard
to
the
dogs
the
remedy
was
plain
their
ration
was
too
small
with
regard
to
the
ponies
the
question
was
not
so
simple
one
of
the
main
foods
for
the
ponies
which
we
had
brought
was
compressed
fodder
in
the
shape
of
bales
theoretically
this
fodder
was
excellent
food
value
and
was
made
of
wheat
which
was
cut
green
and
pressed
whether
it
was
really
wheat
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
about
its
nourishing
qualities
for
our
ponies
when
fed
upon
it
they
lost
weight
until
they
were
just
skin
and
bone
poor
beasts
it
was
pitiful
to
see
them
in
oates
we
had
a
man
who
had
forgotten
as
much
as
most
men
know
about
horses
it
was
no
fault
of
his
that
this
fodder
was
inadequate
nor
that
we
had
lost
so
many
of
the
best
ponies
which
we
had
oates
had
always
been
for
taking
the
worst
ponies
out
on
the
depôt
journey
travelling
as
far
on
to
the
barrier
as
they
could
go
and
there
killing
them
and
depôting
their
flesh
now
oates
took
the
ten
remaining
ponies
into
his
capable
hands
some
of
them
were
scarecrows
especially
poor
jehu
who
was
never
expected
to
start
at
all
and
ended
by
gallantly
pulling
his
somewhat
diminished
load
eight
marches
beyond
one
ton
camp
a
distance
of
miles
another
christopher
was
a
if
ever
a
horse
was
he
had
to
be
thrown
in
order
to
attach
him
to
the
sledge
to
the
end
he
would
lay
out
any
man
who
was
rash
enough
to
give
him
the
chance
once
started
and
it
took
four
men
to
achieve
this
it
was
impossible
to
halt
him
during
the
day
march
and
so
oates
and
his
three
tent
mates
and
their
ponies
had
to
go
without
any
lunch
meal
for
miles
of
the
southern
journey
oates
trained
them
and
fed
them
as
though
they
were
to
run
in
the
derby
they
were
exercised
whenever
possible
throughout
the
winter
and
spring
by
those
who
were
to
lead
them
on
the
actual
journey
fresh
and
good
food
was
found
in
the
shape
of
oilcake
and
oats
a
limited
quantity
of
each
of
which
had
been
brought
and
was
saved
for
the
actual
polar
journey
and
everything
which
care
and
foresight
could
devise
was
done
to
save
them
discomfort
it
is
a
grim
life
for
animals
but
in
the
end
we
were
to
know
that
up
to
the
time
of
that
bad
blizzard
almost
at
the
glacier
gateway
which
was
the
finishing
post
of
these
plucky
animals
they
had
fed
all
they
needed
slept
as
well
and
lived
as
well
as
any
and
better
than
most
horses
in
ordinary
life
at
home
i
congratulate
you
titus
said
wilson
as
we
stood
under
the
shadow
of
mount
hope
with
the
ponies
task
accomplished
and
i
thank
you
said
scott
titus
grunted
and
was
pleased
transport
difficulties
for
the
polar
journey
were
considerable
but
in
every
other
direction
the
outlook
was
bright
the
men
who
were
to
do
the
sledging
had
been
away
from
winter
quarters
for
three
months
they
had
had
plenty
of
sledging
experience
some
of
it
none
too
soft
the
sledges
clothing
and
outfit
generally
were
excellent
although
some
changes
were
suggested
and
could
be
put
into
effect
there
was
no
obvious
means
however
of
effecting
the
improvement
most
desired
a
satisfactory
for
the
ponies
the
work
already
accomplished
was
enormous
on
the
polar
journey
the
ponies
and
dogs
could
now
travel
light
for
the
first
hundred
and
thirty
geographical
miles
when
at
one
ton
camp
they
would
for
the
first
time
take
their
full
loads
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
start
again
with
full
loads
when
so
far
on
your
way
is
obvious
when
it
is
considered
that
the
distance
travelled
depends
upon
the
weight
of
food
that
can
be
carried
during
the
geological
journey
on
the
western
side
of
the
sound
taylor
and
his
party
had
carried
out
much
useful
geological
work
in
dry
valley
and
on
the
ferrar
and
koettlitz
glaciers
which
had
been
accurately
plotted
for
the
charts
and
had
been
examined
for
the
first
time
by
an
expert
physiographer
and
ice
specialist
the
ordinary
routine
of
scientific
and
meteorological
observations
usual
with
all
sledging
parties
was
observed
further
at
cape
evans
there
had
been
running
for
more
than
three
months
a
scientific
station
which
rivalled
in
thoroughness
and
exactitude
any
other
such
station
in
the
world
i
hope
that
later
a
more
detailed
account
may
be
given
of
this
continuous
series
of
observations
some
of
them
demanding
the
most
complex
mechanism
and
all
of
them
watched
over
by
enthusiastic
experts
it
must
here
suffice
to
say
that
we
who
on
our
return
saw
for
the
first
time
the
hut
and
its
annexes
completely
equipped
were
amazed
though
perhaps
the
gadget
which
appealed
most
to
us
at
first
was
the
electric
apparatus
by
which
the
cook
whose
invention
it
was
controlled
the
rising
of
his
excellent
bread
glad
as
we
were
to
find
it
all
and
to
enjoy
the
food
bath
and
comfort
which
it
offered
we
had
no
illusions
about
cape
evans
itself
it
is
uninteresting
as
only
a
spit
of
black
lava
covered
for
the
most
part
with
snow
and
swept
constantly
by
high
winds
and
drift
can
be
uninteresting
the
kenyte
lava
of
which
it
is
formed
is
a
remarkable
rock
and
is
found
in
few
parts
of
the
world
but
when
you
have
seen
one
bit
of
kenyte
you
have
seen
all
unlike
the
spacious
and
lofty
hut
point
peninsula
thirteen
miles
to
the
south
it
has
no
outstanding
hills
and
craters
no
landmarks
such
as
castle
rock
unlike
the
broad
folds
of
cape
royds
six
miles
to
the
north
it
has
none
of
the
rambling
walks
and
varied
lakes
in
which
is
found
most
of
the
limited
plant
life
which
exists
in
these
latitudes
and
though
a
few
mccormick
skuas
meet
here
there
is
no
nursery
of
penguins
such
as
that
which
makes
cape
royds
so
attractive
in
summer
nor
has
the
great
ice
sheet
which
reached
up
erebus
and
spread
over
the
ross
sea
in
the
past
spilled
over
cape
evans
in
its
retreat
a
wealth
of
foreign
granites
dolerites
porphyrys
and
sandstone
such
as
cover
the
otherwise
dull
surface
round
shackleton
old
winter
quarters
cape
evans
is
a
low
lava
flow
jutting
out
some
three
thousand
feet
from
the
face
of
the
glaciers
which
clothe
the
slopes
of
erebus
it
is
roughly
an
equilateral
triangle
in
shape
at
its
base
some
three
thousand
feet
mile
across
this
which
divides
the
cape
from
the
slopes
of
erebus
and
the
crevassed
glaciers
and
giant
which
clothe
them
consists
of
a
ramp
with
a
slope
of
thirty
degrees
and
a
varying
height
of
some
to
feet
from
our
hut
four
hundred
yards
away
it
looks
like
a
great
embankment
behind
which
rises
the
majestic
volcano
erebus
with
its
plume
of
steam
and
smoke
the
cape
itself
does
not
rise
on
the
average
more
than
thirty
feet
and
somewhat
resembles
the
back
of
a
hog
with
several
backbones
the
hollows
between
the
ridges
are
for
the
most
part
filled
with
snow
and
ice
while
in
one
or
two
places
where
the
accumulation
of
snow
is
great
enough
there
are
little
glacierets
which
do
not
travel
far
before
they
ignominiously
peter
out
there
are
two
small
lakes
called
skua
lake
and
island
lake
respectively
there
is
only
one
hill
which
is
almost
behind
the
hut
and
is
called
wind
vane
hill
for
on
it
were
placed
one
of
our
wind
vanes
and
certain
other
meteorological
instruments
into
the
glacieret
which
flowed
down
in
the
lee
of
this
hill
we
drove
two
caves
which
gave
both
an
even
low
temperature
and
excellent
insulation
one
of
them
was
therefore
used
for
our
magnetic
observations
and
the
other
as
an
for
the
mutton
we
had
brought
from
new
zealand
the
north
side
upon
which
we
had
built
our
hut
slopes
down
by
way
of
a
rubbly
beach
to
the
sea
in
north
bay
we
knew
there
was
a
beach
for
we
landed
upon
it
but
we
never
saw
it
again
even
in
the
height
of
summer
for
the
winter
blizzards
formed
an
ice
foot
several
feet
thick
the
other
side
of
the
cape
ends
abruptly
in
black
bastions
and
baby
cliffs
some
thirty
feet
high
the
apex
of
the
triangle
which
forms
as
it
were
the
cape
proper
is
a
similar
kenyte
bluff
the
whole
makes
a
tricky
place
on
which
to
walk
in
the
dark
for
the
surface
is
strewn
with
boulders
of
all
sizes
and
furrowed
and
channelled
by
drifts
of
hard
and
icy
snow
and
quite
suddenly
you
may
find
yourself
prostrate
upon
a
surface
of
slippery
blue
ice
it
may
be
easily
imagined
that
it
is
no
seemly
place
to
exercise
skittish
ponies
or
mules
in
a
cold
wind
but
there
is
no
other
place
when
the
is
unsafe
come
and
stand
outside
the
hut
door
all
round
you
except
where
the
cape
joins
the
mountain
is
the
sea
you
are
facing
north
with
your
back
to
the
great
ice
barrier
and
the
pole
with
your
eyes
looking
out
of
the
mouth
of
mcmurdo
sound
over
the
ross
sea
towards
new
zealand
two
thousand
miles
of
open
water
pack
and
bergs
look
over
the
sea
to
your
left
it
is
and
though
the
sun
will
not
appear
above
the
horizon
he
is
still
near
enough
to
throw
a
soft
yellow
light
over
the
western
mountains
these
form
the
thirty
miles
across
the
sound
and
as
they
disappear
northwards
are
miraged
up
into
the
air
and
float
black
islands
in
a
lemon
sky
straight
ahead
of
you
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
but
black
open
sea
with
a
high
light
over
the
horizon
which
you
know
betokens
pack
this
is
ice
blink
but
as
you
watch
there
appears
and
disappears
a
little
dark
smudge
this
puzzles
you
for
some
time
and
then
you
realize
that
this
is
the
mirage
of
some
far
mountain
or
of
beaufort
island
which
guards
the
mouth
of
mcmurdo
sound
against
such
traffic
as
ever
comes
that
way
by
piling
up
the
ice
floes
across
the
entrance
as
you
still
look
north
in
the
middle
distance
jutting
out
into
the
sea
is
a
low
black
line
of
land
with
one
excrescence
this
is
cape
royds
with
shackleton
old
hut
upon
it
the
excrescence
is
high
peak
and
this
line
marks
the
first
land
upon
the
eastern
side
of
mcmurdo
sound
which
you
can
see
and
indeed
is
actually
the
most
eastern
point
of
ross
island
it
disappears
abruptly
behind
a
high
wall
and
if
you
let
your
eyes
travel
round
towards
your
right
front
you
see
that
the
wall
is
a
perpendicular
cliff
two
hundred
feet
high
of
pure
green
and
blue
ice
which
falls
sheer
into
the
sea
and
forms
with
cape
evans
on
which
we
stand
the
bay
which
lies
in
front
of
our
hut
and
which
we
called
north
bay
this
great
with
its
crevasses
towers
bastions
and
cornices
was
a
source
of
delight
to
us
it
forms
the
snout
of
one
of
the
many
glaciers
which
slide
down
the
slopes
of
erebus
in
smooth
slopes
and
contours
where
the
mountain
underneath
is
of
regular
shape
in
impassable
icefalls
where
the
underlying
surface
is
steep
or
broken
this
particular
ice
stream
is
called
the
barne
glacier
and
is
about
two
miles
across
the
whole
background
from
our
right
front
to
our
right
rear
that
is
from
to
is
occupied
by
our
massive
and
volcanic
neighbour
erebus
he
stands
feet
high
we
live
beneath
his
shadow
and
have
both
admiration
and
friendship
for
him
sometimes
perhaps
tinged
with
respect
however
there
are
no
signs
of
dangerous
eruptive
disturbances
in
modern
times
and
we
feel
pretty
safe
despite
the
fact
that
the
smoke
which
issues
from
his
crater
sometimes
rises
in
dense
clouds
for
many
thousands
of
feet
and
at
others
the
trail
of
his
plume
can
be
measured
for
at
least
a
hundred
miles
if
you
are
not
too
cold
standing
about
it
does
not
pay
to
stand
about
at
cape
evans
let
us
make
our
way
behind
the
hut
and
up
wind
vane
hill
this
is
only
some
feet
high
yet
it
dominates
the
rest
of
the
cape
and
is
steep
enough
to
require
a
scramble
even
now
when
the
wind
is
calm
look
out
that
you
do
not
step
on
the
electric
wires
which
connect
the
cups
on
the
hill
with
the
recording
dial
in
the
hut
these
cups
revolve
in
the
wind
the
revolutions
being
registered
electrically
every
four
miles
a
signal
was
sent
to
the
hut
and
a
pen
working
upon
a
chronograph
registered
one
more
step
there
is
also
a
meteorological
screen
on
the
summit
which
has
to
be
visited
at
eight
each
morning
in
all
weathers
illustration
a
summer
view
over
cape
evans
and
mcmurdo
sound
from
the
ramp
emery
walker
limited
collotypers
arrived
on
the
top
you
will
now
be
facing
south
that
is
in
the
opposite
direction
to
which
you
were
facing
before
the
first
thing
that
will
strike
you
is
that
the
sea
now
frozen
in
the
bays
though
still
unfrozen
in
the
open
sound
flows
in
nearly
to
your
feet
the
second
that
though
the
sea
stretches
back
for
nearly
twenty
miles
yet
the
horizon
shows
land
or
ice
in
every
direction
for
a
ship
this
is
a
as
ross
found
seventy
years
ago
but
as
soon
as
you
have
grasped
these
two
facts
your
whole
attention
will
be
riveted
to
the
amazing
sight
on
your
left
here
are
the
southern
slopes
of
erebus
but
how
different
from
those
which
you
have
lately
seen
northwards
they
fell
in
broad
calm
lines
to
a
beautiful
stately
cliff
which
edged
the
sea
but
here
all
the
epithets
and
all
the
adjectives
which
denote
chaotic
immensity
could
not
adequately
tell
of
them
visualize
a
torrent
ten
miles
long
and
twenty
miles
broad
imagine
it
falling
over
mountainous
rocks
and
tumbling
over
itself
in
giant
waves
imagine
it
arrested
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
frozen
and
white
countless
blizzards
have
swept
their
drifts
over
it
but
have
failed
to
hide
it
and
it
continues
to
move
as
you
stand
in
the
still
cold
air
you
may
sometimes
hear
the
silence
broken
by
the
sharp
reports
as
the
cold
contracts
it
or
its
own
weight
splits
it
nature
is
tearing
up
that
ice
as
human
beings
tear
paper
the
is
not
so
high
here
and
is
more
broken
up
by
crevasses
and
caves
and
more
covered
with
snow
some
five
miles
along
the
coast
the
white
line
is
broken
by
a
bluff
and
black
outcrop
of
rock
this
is
head
and
beyond
it
is
the
low
white
line
of
glacier
tongue
jutting
out
for
miles
into
the
sea
we
know
for
we
have
already
crossed
it
that
there
is
a
small
frozen
bay
of
beyond
but
all
we
can
see
from
cape
evans
is
the
base
of
the
hut
point
peninsula
with
a
rock
outcrop
just
showing
where
the
hutton
cliffs
lie
the
peninsula
prevents
us
from
seeing
the
barrier
though
the
barrier
wind
is
constantly
flowing
over
it
as
the
clouds
of
drift
now
smoking
over
the
cliffs
bear
witness
farther
to
the
right
still
the
land
is
clear
castle
rock
stands
up
like
a
sentinel
and
beyond
are
arrival
heights
and
the
old
craters
we
have
got
to
know
so
well
during
our
stay
at
hut
point
the
discovery
hut
which
would
in
any
case
be
invisible
at
fifteen
miles
is
round
that
steep
rocky
corner
which
ends
the
peninsula
due
south
from
where
we
stand
there
remains
undescribed
the
quadrant
which
stretches
to
our
right
front
from
south
to
west
just
as
we
have
previously
seen
the
line
of
the
western
mountains
disappearing
to
the
north
miraged
up
in
the
light
of
the
sun
so
now
we
see
the
same
line
of
mountains
running
south
with
many
miles
of
sea
or
barrier
between
us
and
them
on
the
far
southern
horizon
almost
in
transit
with
hut
point
stands
minna
bluff
some
ninety
miles
away
beyond
which
we
have
laid
the
one
ton
depôt
and
from
this
point
as
our
eyes
move
round
to
the
right
we
see
peak
after
peak
of
these
great
mountain
ranges
discovery
morning
lister
hooker
and
the
glaciers
which
divide
them
one
from
another
they
rise
almost
without
a
break
to
a
height
of
thirteen
thousand
feet
between
us
and
them
is
the
barrier
to
the
south
and
the
sea
to
the
north
unless
a
blizzard
is
impending
or
blowing
they
are
clearly
visible
a
gigantic
wall
of
snow
and
ice
and
rock
which
bounds
our
view
to
the
west
constantly
varied
by
the
colour
of
the
antarctic
beyond
is
the
plateau
we
have
not
yet
mentioned
four
islands
which
lie
within
a
radius
of
about
three
miles
from
where
we
stand
the
most
important
is
a
mile
from
the
end
of
cape
evans
and
is
called
inaccessible
island
owing
to
the
inhospitality
of
its
steep
lava
side
even
when
the
sea
is
frozen
we
found
a
way
up
but
it
is
not
a
very
interesting
place
tent
island
lies
farther
out
and
to
the
the
remaining
two
which
are
more
islets
than
islands
rise
in
front
of
us
in
south
bay
they
are
called
great
and
little
razorback
being
ribs
of
rock
with
a
sharp
divide
in
the
centre
the
latter
of
these
is
the
refuge
upon
which
scott
party
returning
to
cape
evans
pitched
their
camp
when
overtaken
by
a
blizzard
some
weeks
ago
all
these
islands
are
of
volcanic
origin
and
black
in
general
colour
but
i
believe
there
is
evidence
to
show
that
the
lava
stream
which
created
them
flowed
from
mcmurdo
sound
rather
than
from
the
more
obvious
craters
of
erebus
their
importance
in
this
story
is
the
indirect
help
they
gave
in
holding
in
against
southerly
blizzards
and
in
forming
landmarks
which
proved
useful
more
than
once
to
men
who
had
lost
their
bearings
in
darkness
and
thick
weather
in
this
respect
also
several
icebergs
which
sailed
in
from
the
ross
sea
and
grounded
on
the
shallows
which
run
between
inaccessible
island
and
the
cape
as
well
as
in
south
bay
were
most
useful
as
well
as
being
interesting
and
beautiful
for
two
years
we
watched
the
weathering
of
these
great
towers
and
bastions
of
ice
by
sea
and
sun
and
wind
and
left
them
still
lying
in
the
same
positions
but
mere
tumbled
ruins
of
their
former
selves
many
places
in
the
panorama
we
have
examined
show
black
rock
and
the
cape
on
which
we
stand
exposes
at
times
more
black
than
white
this
fact
always
puzzles
those
who
naturally
conclude
that
all
the
antarctic
is
covered
with
ice
and
snow
the
explanation
is
simple
that
winds
of
the
great
velocity
which
prevails
in
this
region
will
not
only
prevent
snow
resting
to
windward
of
rocks
and
cliffs
but
will
even
wear
away
the
rocks
themselves
the
fact
that
these
winds
always
blow
from
the
south
or
southerly
causes
a
tendency
for
this
aspect
of
any
projecting
rock
to
be
blown
free
from
snow
while
the
north
or
lee
side
is
drifted
up
by
a
marbled
and
extremely
hard
tongue
of
snow
which
disappears
into
a
point
at
a
distance
which
depends
upon
the
size
of
the
rock
of
course
for
the
most
part
the
land
is
covered
to
such
a
depth
by
glaciers
and
snow
that
no
wind
will
do
more
than
pack
the
snow
or
expose
the
ice
beneath
at
the
same
time
to
visualize
the
antarctic
as
a
white
land
is
a
mistake
for
not
only
is
there
much
rock
projecting
wherever
mountains
or
rocky
capes
and
islands
rise
but
the
snow
seldom
looks
white
and
if
carefully
looked
at
will
be
found
to
be
shaded
with
many
colours
but
chiefly
with
cobalt
blue
or
and
all
the
gradations
of
lilac
and
mauve
which
the
mixture
of
these
colours
will
produce
a
white
day
is
so
rare
that
i
have
recollections
of
going
out
from
the
hut
or
the
tent
and
being
impressed
by
the
fact
that
the
snow
really
looked
white
when
to
the
beautiful
tints
in
the
sky
and
the
delicate
shading
on
the
snow
are
added
perhaps
the
deep
colours
of
the
open
sea
with
reflections
from
the
ice
foot
and
in
it
all
brilliant
blues
and
emerald
greens
then
indeed
a
man
may
realize
how
beautiful
this
world
can
be
and
how
clean
though
i
may
struggle
with
inadequate
expression
to
show
the
reader
that
this
pure
land
of
the
south
has
many
gifts
to
squander
upon
those
who
woo
her
chiefest
of
these
gifts
is
that
of
her
beauty
next
perhaps
is
that
of
grandeur
and
immensity
of
giant
mountains
and
limitless
spaces
which
must
awe
the
most
casual
and
may
well
terrify
the
least
imaginative
of
mortals
and
there
is
one
other
gift
which
she
gives
with
both
hands
more
prosaic
but
almost
more
desirable
that
is
the
gift
of
sleep
perhaps
it
is
true
of
others
as
is
certainly
the
case
with
me
that
the
more
horrible
the
conditions
in
which
we
sleep
the
more
soothing
and
wonderful
are
the
dreams
which
visit
us
some
of
us
have
slept
in
a
hurricane
of
wind
and
a
hell
of
drifting
snow
and
darkness
with
no
roof
above
our
heads
with
no
tent
to
help
us
home
with
no
conceivable
chance
that
we
should
ever
see
our
friends
again
with
no
food
that
we
could
eat
and
only
the
snow
which
drifted
into
our
which
we
could
drink
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
we
slept
not
only
soundly
the
greater
part
of
these
days
and
nights
but
with
a
certain
numbed
pleasure
we
wanted
something
sweet
to
eat
for
preference
tinned
peaches
in
syrup
well
that
is
the
kind
of
sleep
the
antarctic
offers
you
at
her
worst
or
nearly
at
her
worst
and
if
the
worst
or
best
happens
and
death
comes
for
you
in
the
snow
he
comes
disguised
as
sleep
and
you
greet
him
rather
as
a
welcome
friend
than
as
a
gruesome
foe
she
treats
you
thus
when
you
are
in
the
extremity
of
peril
and
hardship
perhaps
then
you
can
imagine
what
draughts
of
deep
and
healthy
slumber
she
will
give
a
tired
sledger
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
march
in
summer
when
after
a
nice
hot
supper
he
tucks
his
soft
dry
warm
furry
bag
round
him
with
the
light
beating
in
through
the
green
silk
tent
the
homely
smell
of
tobacco
in
the
air
and
the
only
noise
that
of
the
ponies
tethered
outside
munching
their
supper
in
the
sun
and
so
it
came
about
that
during
our
sojourn
at
cape
evans
in
our
comfortable
warm
roomy
home
we
took
our
full
allotted
span
of
sleep
most
were
in
their
bunks
by
sometimes
with
a
candle
and
a
book
not
rarely
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
the
acetylene
was
turned
off
at
for
we
had
a
limited
quantity
of
carbide
and
soon
the
room
was
in
complete
darkness
save
for
the
glow
of
the
galley
stove
and
where
a
splash
of
light
showed
the
night
watchman
preparing
his
supper
some
snored
loudly
but
none
so
loud
as
bowers
others
talked
in
their
sleep
the
more
so
when
some
nasty
experience
had
lately
set
their
nerves
on
edge
there
was
always
the
ticking
of
many
instruments
and
sometimes
the
ring
of
a
little
bell
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
what
most
of
them
meant
on
a
calm
night
no
sound
penetrated
except
perhaps
the
whine
of
a
dog
or
the
occasional
kick
of
a
pony
in
the
stable
outside
any
disturbance
was
the
night
watchman
job
but
on
a
bad
blizzard
night
the
wind
as
it
tore
seawards
over
the
hut
roared
and
howled
in
the
ventilator
let
into
the
roof
in
the
more
furious
gusts
the
whole
hut
shook
and
the
pebbles
picked
up
by
the
hurricane
scattered
themselves
noisily
against
the
woodwork
of
the
southern
wall
we
did
not
get
many
nights
like
these
the
first
winter
during
the
second
we
seemed
to
get
nothing
else
one
ghastly
blizzard
blew
for
six
weeks
the
night
watchman
took
his
last
hourly
observation
at
and
was
free
to
turn
in
after
waking
the
cook
and
making
up
the
fire
frequently
however
he
had
so
much
work
to
do
that
he
preferred
to
forgo
his
sleep
and
remain
up
for
instance
if
the
weather
looked
threatening
he
would
take
his
pony
out
for
exercise
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
morning
or
those
lists
of
stores
were
not
finished
or
that
fish
trap
had
to
be
looked
after
all
kinds
of
things
a
sizzling
on
the
fire
and
a
smell
of
porridge
and
fried
seal
liver
heralded
breakfast
which
was
at
in
theory
and
a
good
deal
later
in
practice
a
sleepy
eye
might
see
the
meteorologist
stumping
out
simpson
always
stumped
to
change
the
records
in
his
magnetic
cave
and
visit
his
instruments
on
the
hill
twenty
minutes
later
he
would
be
back
as
often
as
not
covered
with
drift
and
his
wind
helmet
all
iced
up
meanwhile
the
more
hardy
ones
were
washing
that
is
they
rubbed
themselves
all
shivering
with
snow
of
a
minus
temperature
and
pretended
they
liked
it
perhaps
they
were
right
but
we
told
them
it
was
swank
i
not
sure
that
it
was
it
should
be
explained
that
water
was
seldom
possible
in
a
land
where
ice
is
more
abundant
than
coal
one
great
danger
threatened
all
our
meals
in
this
hut
namely
that
of
a
cag
a
cag
is
an
argument
sometimes
well
informed
and
always
heated
upon
any
subject
under
the
sun
or
temporarily
in
our
case
the
moon
they
ranged
from
the
pole
to
the
equator
from
the
barrier
to
portsmouth
hard
and
plymouth
hoe
they
began
on
the
smallest
of
excuses
they
continued
through
the
widest
field
they
never
ended
they
were
left
in
mid
air
perhaps
to
be
caught
up
again
and
twisted
and
tortured
months
after
what
caused
the
cones
on
the
ramp
the
formation
of
ice
crystals
the
names
and
order
of
the
if
you
left
the
main
gate
of
portsmouth
dockyard
and
walked
to
the
unicorn
gate
if
you
ever
reached
so
far
the
best
kinds
of
crampons
in
the
antarctic
and
the
best
place
in
london
for
oysters
the
ideal
pony
rug
would
the
wine
steward
at
the
ritz
look
surprised
if
you
asked
him
for
a
pint
of
bitter
though
the
times
atlas
does
not
rise
to
nor
chambers
encyclopaedia
sink
to
behaviour
at
our
more
expensive
hotels
yet
they
settled
more
of
these
disputes
than
anything
else
on
the
day
we
are
discussing
though
mutterings
can
still
be
heard
from
nelson
cubicle
the
long
table
has
been
cleared
and
every
one
is
busy
by
from
now
until
supper
at
work
is
done
by
all
in
some
form
or
other
except
for
a
short
luncheon
interval
i
do
not
mean
for
a
minute
that
we
all
sit
down
as
a
man
may
do
in
an
office
at
home
and
solidly
grind
away
for
upwards
of
nine
hours
or
more
not
a
bit
of
it
we
have
much
work
out
of
doors
and
exercise
is
a
consideration
of
the
utmost
importance
but
when
we
go
out
each
individual
quite
naturally
takes
the
opportunity
to
carry
out
such
work
as
concerns
him
whether
it
deals
with
ice
or
rocks
dogs
or
horses
meteorology
or
biology
or
balloons
when
blizzards
allowed
the
ponies
were
exercised
by
their
respective
leaders
between
breakfast
and
when
they
were
fed
this
exercising
of
animals
might
be
a
pleasant
business
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
the
deuce
and
all
it
depended
on
the
pony
and
the
weather
a
blubber
fire
was
kept
burning
in
the
snug
stable
which
was
built
against
the
lee
wall
of
the
hut
the
ponies
were
therefore
quite
warm
and
found
it
chilly
directly
they
were
led
outside
even
if
there
was
no
wind
the
difficulties
of
exercising
them
in
the
dark
were
so
great
that
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
it
was
difficult
to
give
them
sufficient
work
for
the
good
feeding
they
received
add
to
this
the
fact
that
one
at
any
rate
of
these
variable
animals
was
really
savage
and
that
most
of
them
were
keen
to
break
away
if
possible
and
the
hour
of
exercise
was
not
without
its
thrills
even
on
the
calmest
and
most
moonlight
days
the
worst
days
were
those
when
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
the
ponies
should
be
taken
out
on
the
or
not
it
was
thick
weather
that
was
to
be
feared
for
then
if
the
leader
once
lost
his
bearings
it
was
most
difficult
for
him
to
return
an
overcast
sky
light
falling
snow
perhaps
a
light
northerly
wind
generally
meant
a
blizzard
but
the
blizzard
might
not
break
for
hours
it
might
be
upon
you
in
four
seconds
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
the
pony
should
miss
his
exercise
whether
the
fish
trap
should
be
raised
whether
to
put
off
your
intended
trip
to
cape
royds
generally
the
risks
were
taken
for
on
the
whole
it
is
better
to
be
a
little
than
a
little
while
always
there
was
a
something
inside
urging
you
to
do
it
just
because
there
was
a
certain
risk
and
you
hardly
liked
not
to
do
it
it
is
so
easy
to
be
afraid
of
being
afraid
let
me
give
one
instance
it
must
be
typical
of
many
it
was
thick
as
it
could
be
no
moon
no
stars
light
falling
snow
and
not
even
a
light
breeze
to
keep
in
your
face
to
give
direction
bowers
and
i
decided
to
take
our
ponies
out
and
once
over
the
tide
crack
where
the
working
joins
the
fast
we
kept
close
under
the
tall
cliffs
of
the
barne
glacier
so
far
all
was
well
and
also
when
we
struck
along
a
small
crack
into
the
middle
of
the
bay
where
there
was
a
thermometer
screen
this
we
read
with
some
difficulty
by
the
light
of
a
match
and
started
back
towards
the
hut
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
knew
we
were
quite
lost
until
an
iceberg
which
we
recognized
showed
us
that
we
had
been
walking
at
right
angles
to
our
course
and
got
us
safe
home
on
a
clear
crisp
day
with
the
full
moon
to
show
you
the
ridges
and
cracks
and
sastrugi
it
was
most
pleasant
to
put
on
your
ski
and
wander
forth
with
no
object
but
that
of
healthy
pleasure
perhaps
you
would
make
your
way
round
the
bluff
end
of
the
cape
and
strike
southwards
here
you
may
visit
nelson
working
with
his
thermometers
and
current
meters
and
other
instruments
over
a
circular
hole
in
the
ice
which
he
keeps
open
from
day
to
day
by
breaking
out
the
of
newly
formed
ice
he
has
connected
himself
with
the
hut
by
telephone
and
built
round
himself
an
igloo
of
drifted
snow
and
the
aforesaid
which
effectually
shelter
him
from
the
wind
or
you
may
meet
meares
and
dimitri
returning
with
the
from
a
visit
to
hut
point
a
little
farther
on
the
silence
is
complete
but
now
your
ear
catches
the
metallic
scratch
of
ski
sticks
on
hard
ice
there
is
some
one
else
over
there
it
may
be
many
miles
away
for
sound
travels
in
an
amazing
way
every
now
and
then
there
comes
a
sharp
crack
like
a
pistol
shot
it
is
the
ice
contracting
in
the
glaciers
of
erebus
and
you
know
that
it
is
getting
colder
your
breath
smokes
forming
white
rime
over
your
face
and
ice
in
your
beard
if
it
is
very
cold
you
may
actually
hear
it
crackle
as
it
freezes
in
mid
air
these
were
the
days
which
remain
visibly
in
the
mind
as
the
most
enjoyable
during
this
first
winter
season
it
was
all
so
novel
these
and
amongst
us
terrors
of
the
long
winter
night
the
atmosphere
is
very
clear
when
it
is
not
filled
with
snow
or
ice
crystals
and
the
moonlight
lay
upon
the
land
so
that
we
could
see
the
main
outlines
of
the
hut
point
peninsula
and
even
minna
bluff
out
on
the
barrier
ninety
miles
away
the
of
erebus
showed
as
great
dark
walls
but
above
them
the
blue
ice
of
the
glaciers
gleamed
silvery
and
the
steam
flowed
lazily
from
the
crater
carried
away
in
a
long
line
showing
us
that
the
northerly
breezes
prevailed
up
there
and
were
storing
up
trouble
in
the
south
sometimes
a
shooting
star
would
seem
to
fall
right
into
the
mountain
and
for
the
most
part
the
aurora
flitted
uneasily
about
in
the
sky
the
importance
of
plenty
of
exercise
was
generally
recognized
and
our
experience
showed
us
that
the
happiest
and
healthiest
members
of
our
party
during
this
first
year
were
those
who
spent
the
longest
period
in
the
fresh
air
as
a
rule
we
walked
and
worked
and
alone
not
i
feel
sure
because
of
any
individual
distaste
for
the
company
of
our
fellows
but
rather
because
of
a
general
inclination
to
spend
a
short
period
of
the
day
without
company
at
least
this
is
certainly
true
of
the
officers
i
am
not
so
sure
about
the
men
under
the
circumstances
the
only
time
in
the
year
that
a
man
could
be
alone
was
in
his
walks
abroad
from
winter
quarters
for
the
hut
of
course
was
always
occupied
and
when
sledging
this
existence
was
continuous
night
and
day
there
was
one
regular
exception
to
this
rule
every
possible
evening
that
is
to
say
if
it
was
not
blowing
a
full
blizzard
wilson
and
bowers
went
up
the
ramp
together
read
bertram
now
this
phrase
will
convey
little
meaning
without
some
explanation
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
ramp
as
the
steep
rubbly
slope
partly
covered
by
snow
and
partly
by
ice
which
divided
the
cape
on
which
we
lived
from
the
glaciated
slopes
of
erebus
after
a
breathless
scramble
up
this
embankment
one
came
upon
a
belt
of
rough
ground
from
which
arose
at
intervals
conical
mounds
the
origin
of
which
puzzled
us
for
many
months
at
length
by
the
obvious
means
of
cutting
a
section
through
one
of
them
it
was
proved
that
there
was
a
solid
kenyte
lava
block
in
the
centre
of
this
cone
proving
that
the
whole
was
formed
by
the
weathering
of
a
single
rock
threading
your
way
for
some
hundreds
of
yards
through
this
terrain
a
scramble
attended
by
many
slips
and
falls
on
a
dark
night
you
reached
the
first
signs
of
glaciation
a
little
farther
isolated
in
the
ice
stream
is
another
group
of
debris
cones
and
on
the
largest
of
these
we
placed
meteorological
screen
b
commonly
called
bertram
this
screen
together
with
a
algernon
and
c
clarence
which
were
in
north
and
south
bays
respectively
were
erected
by
bowers
who
thought
rightly
that
they
would
form
an
object
to
which
men
could
guide
their
walks
and
that
at
the
same
time
the
observations
of
maximum
minimum
and
present
temperatures
would
be
a
useful
check
to
the
meteorologist
when
he
came
to
compare
them
with
those
taken
at
the
hut
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
book
in
which
we
used
to
enter
these
observations
shows
that
the
air
temperatures
out
on
the
vary
considerably
from
those
on
the
cape
and
that
the
temperatures
several
hundred
feet
up
on
the
slopes
of
erebus
are
often
several
degrees
higher
than
those
taken
at
i
believe
that
much
of
the
weather
in
this
part
of
the
world
is
an
intensely
local
affair
and
these
screens
produced
useful
data
wilson
and
bowers
would
go
up
the
ramp
when
it
was
blowing
and
drifting
fairly
hard
so
that
although
the
rocks
and
landmarks
immediately
round
them
were
visible
all
beyond
was
blotted
out
it
is
quite
possible
to
walk
thus
among
landmarks
which
you
know
at
a
time
when
it
is
most
unwise
to
go
out
on
to
the
where
there
are
no
fixed
points
to
act
as
a
guide
it
was
wilson
pleasant
conceit
to
keep
his
balaclava
rolled
up
so
that
his
face
was
bare
on
such
occasions
being
somewhat
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
as
yet
been
imagine
our
joy
when
he
entered
the
hut
one
cold
windy
evening
with
two
white
spots
on
his
cheeks
which
he
vainly
tried
to
hide
behind
his

which
was

work

were

to
do
in

this
table
displayed
a
dark
blue
cloth
but
for
meals
and
at
all
other
times
it
was
covered
with
white
oilcloth
lunch
itself
was
a
pleasant
meatless
meal
consisting
of
limited
bread
and
butter
with
plenty
of
jam
or
cheese
tea
or
cocoa
the
latter
being
undoubtedly
a
most
useful
drink
in
a
cold
country
many
controversies
raged
over
the
rival
merits
of
tea
and
cocoa
some
of
us
made
for
ourselves
buttered
toast
at
the
galley
fire
i
must
myself
confess
to
a
weakness
for
welsh
rarebit
and
others
followed
my
example
on
cheese
days
in
making
messes
of
which
we
were
not
a
little
proud
scott
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
that
is
at
the
east
end
but
otherwise
we
all
took
our
places
haphazard
from
meal
to
meal
as
our
conversation
or
want
of
it
merited
or
as
our
arrival
found
a
vacant
chair
thus
if
you
felt
talkative
you
might
always
find
a
listener
in
debenham
if
inclined
to
listen
yourself
it
was
only
necessary
to
sit
near
taylor
or
nelson
if
on
the
other
hand
you
just
wanted
to
be
quiet
atkinson
or
oates
would
probably
give
you
a
congenial
atmosphere
there
was
never
any
want
of
conversation
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
no
conversation
was
expected
we
most
of
us
know
the
horrible
blankness
which
comes
over
our
minds
when
we
realize
that
because
we
are
eating
we
are
also
supposed
to
talk
whether
we
have
anything
to
say
or
not
it
was
also
due
to
the
more
primitive
reason
that
in
a
company
of
specialists
whose
travels
extended
over
most
parts
of
the
earth
and
whose
subjects
overlapped
and
interlocked
at
so
many
points
topics
of
conversation
were
not
only
numerous
but
full
of
possibilities
of
expansion
add
to
this
that
from
the
nature
of
our
work
we
were
probably
people
of
an
inquisitive
turn
of
mind
and
wanted
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
subjects
which
presented
themselves
and
you
may
expect
to
find
as
was
in
fact
the
case
an
atmosphere
of
pleasant
and
quite
interesting
conversation
which
sometimes
degenerated
into
heated
and
noisy
argument
the
business
of
eating
over
pipes
were
lit
without
further
formality
i
mention
pipes
only
because
while
we
had
a
most
bountiful
supply
of
tobacco
the
kindly
present
of
wills
our
supply
of
cigarettes
from
the
same
source
was
purposely
limited
and
only
a
small
quantity
were
landed
allowing
of
a
ration
to
such
members
who
wished
consequently
cigarettes
were
an
article
of
some
value
and
in
a
land
where
the
ordinary
forms
of
currency
are
valueless
they
became
a
frequent
stake
to
venture
when
making
bets
indeed
i
bet
you
ten
cigarettes
or
i
bet
you
a
dinner
when
we
get
back
to
london
became
the
most
frequent
bids
of
the
argumentative
gambler
occasionally
varied
when
the
bettor
was
more
than
usually
certain
of
the
issue
by
the
offer
of
a
pair
of
socks
by
two
we
were
dispersed
once
more
to
our
various
works
and
duties
if
it
was
bearable
outside
the
hut
would
soon
be
empty
save
for
the
cook
and
a
couple
of
seamen
washing
up
the
plates
otherwise
every
one
went
out
to
make
the
most
of
any
glimmering
of
daylight
which
still
came
to
us
from
the
sun
below
the
northern
horizon
and
here
it
may
be
explained
that
whereas
in
england
the
sun
rises
more
or
less
in
the
east
is
due
south
at
and
sets
in
the
west
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
antarctic
regions
in
the
latitude
in
which
we
now
lived
the
sun
is
at
his
highest
at
in
the
north
at
his
lowest
at
midnight
in
the
south
as
is
generally
known
he
remains
entirely
above
the
horizon
for
four
months
of
the
summer
and
entirely
below
the
horizon
for
four
months
in
the
winter
april
about
february
the
end
of
summer
he
begins
to
set
and
rise
due
south
at
midnight
the
next
day
he
sets
a
little
earlier
and
dips
a
little
deeper
during
march
and
april
he
is
going
deeper
and
deeper
every
day
until
by
the
middle
of
april
he
is
set
all
the
time
except
for
just
a
peep
over
the
northern
horizon
at
which
is
his
last
farewell
before
he
goes
away
the
reverse
process
takes
place
from
august
onwards
on
this
date
the
sun
just
peeped
above
the
sea
to
the
north
of
our
hut
the
next
day
he
rose
a
little
higher
and
longer
and
in
a
few
weeks
he
was
rising
well
in
the
east
and
sinking
behind
the
western
mountains
but
he
did
not
stop
there
soon
he
was
rising
in
the
until
in
the
latter
days
of
september
he
never
rose
for
he
never
set
but
circled
round
us
by
day
and
night
on
midsummer
day
december
at
the
south
pole
the
sun
circles
round
for
hours
without
changing
his
altitude
for
one
minute
of
a
degree
but
elsewhere
he
is
always
rising
in
the
sky
until
in
the
north
and
falling
from
that
time
until
midnight
in
the
south
often
far
too
often
it
was
blizzing
and
it
was
impossible
to
go
out
except
into
the
camp
to
take
the
observations
to
care
for
the
dogs
to
get
ice
for
water
or
to
bring
in
stores
even
a
short
excursion
of
a
few
yards
had
to
be
made
with
great
care
under
such
circumstances
and
certainly
no
one
went
outside
more
than
was
necessary
if
only
because
one
was
obliged
to
dig
the
accumulated
drift
from
the
door
before
it
was
possible
to
proceed
blizzard
or
no
blizzard
most
men
were
back
in
the
hut
soon
after
four
and
from
then
until
worked
steadily
at
their
jobs
as
supper
time
approached
some
person
would
sit
down
and
play
on
the
broadwood
pianola
which
was
one
of
our
blessings
and
so
it
was
that
we
came
to
supper
with
good
tempers
as
well
as
keen
appetites
soup
in
which
the
flavour
of
tomatoes
occurred
all
too
frequently
followed
by
seal
or
penguin
and
twice
a
week
by
new
zealand
mutton
with
tinned
vegetables
formed
the
basis
of
our
meal
and
this
was
followed
by
a
pudding
we
drank
lime
juice
and
water
which
sometimes
included
a
suspicious
penguin
flavour
derived
from
the
ice
slopes
from
which
our
water
was
quarried
during
our
passage
out
to
new
zealand
in
the
ship
or
as
meares
always
insisted
on
calling
her
the
steamer
it
was
our
pleasant
custom
to
have
a
glass
of
port
or
a
liqueur
after
dinner
alas
we
had
this
no
longer
after
leaving
new
zealand
space
allowed
of
little
wine
being
carried
in
the
terra
nova
even
if
the
general
medical
opinion
of
the
expedition
had
not
considered
its
presence
undesirable
we
had
however
a
few
cases
for
special
festivals
as
well
as
some
excellent
liqueur
brandy
which
was
carried
as
medical
comforts
on
our
sledge
journeys
any
officer
who
allowed
the
distribution
of
this
luxury
on
nearing
the
end
of
a
journey
became
extremely
popular
lack
of
wine
probably
led
to
the
suspension
of
a
custom
which
had
prevailed
on
the
terra
nova
namely
the
drinking
of
the
old
toast
of
saturday
night
sweethearts
and
wives
may
our
sweethearts
become
our
wives
and
our
wives
remain
our
sweethearts
and
that
more
appropriate
in
our
case
toast
of
sunday
namely
absent
friends
we
had
but
few
married
officers
though
i
must
say
most
survivors
of
the
expedition
hurried
to
remedy
this
single
state
of
affairs
when
they
returned
to
civilization
only
two
of
them
are
unmarried
now
most
of
them
will
probably
make
a
success
of
it
for
the
good
arctic
explorer
has
most
of
the
defects
and
qualities
of
a
good
husband
on
the
top
of
the
pianola
close
to
the
head
of
the
table
lived
the
gramophone
and
under
the
one
we
possessed
which
hung
on
the
bulkhead
of
scott
cubicle
was
a
box
with
shelves
on
which
lay
our
records
it
was
usual
to
start
the
gramophone
after
dinner
and
its
value
may
be
imagined
it
is
necessary
to
be
cut
off
from
civilization
and
all
that
it
means
to
enable
you
to
realize
fully
the
power
music
has
to
recall
the
past
or
the
depths
of
meaning
in
it
to
soothe
the
present
and
give
hope
for
the
future
we
had
also
records
of
good
classical
music
and
the
individual
who
played
them
had
his
reward
in
the
pleasant
atmosphere
of
homeliness
which
made
itself
felt
after
dinner
had
been
cleared
away
some
men
sat
on
at
the
table
occupied
with
books
and
games
others
dispersed
to
various
jobs
in
the
matter
of
games
it
was
noticeable
that
one
would
have
its
vogue
and
yield
place
to
another
without
any
apparent
reason
for
a
few
weeks
it
might
be
chess
which
would
then
yield
its
place
to
draughts
and
backgammon
and
again
come
into
favour
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
though
we
had
playing
cards
with
us
none
of
our
company
appeared
desirous
to
use
them
in
fact
i
can
not
remember
seeing
a
game
of
cards
played
except
in
the
ship
on
the
voyage
from
england
illustration
the
sea
fringe
of
ice
with
regard
to
books
we
were
moderately
well
provided
with
good
modern
fiction
and
very
well
provided
with
such
authors
as
thackeray
charlotte
brontë
and
dickens
with
all
respect
to
the
kind
givers
of
these
books
i
would
suggest
that
the
literature
most
acceptable
to
us
in
the
circumstances
under
which
we
did
most
of
our
reading
that
is
in
winter
quarters
was
the
best
of
the
more
recent
novels
such
as
barrie
kipling
merriman
and
maurice
hewlett
we
certainly
should
have
taken
with
us
as
much
of
shaw
barker
ibsen
and
wells
as
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
for
the
train
of
ideas
started
by
these
works
and
the
discussions
to
which
they
would
have
given
rise
would
have
been
a
godsend
to
us
in
our
isolated
circumstances
the
one
type
of
book
in
which
we
were
rich
was
arctic
and
antarctic
travel
we
had
a
library
of
these
given
to
us
by
sir
lewis
beaumont
and
sir
albert
markham
which
was
very
complete
they
were
extremely
popular
though
it
is
probably
true
that
these
are
books
which
you
want
rather
to
read
on
your
return
than
when
you
are
actually
experiencing
a
similar
life
they
were
used
extensively
in
discussions
or
lectures
on
such
polar
subjects
as
clothing
food
rations
and
the
building
of
igloos
while
we
were
constantly
referring
to
them
on
specific
points
and
getting
useful
hints
such
as
the
use
of
an
inner
lining
to
our
tents
and
the
mechanism
of
a
blubber
stove
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
importance
of
maps
and
books
of
reference
and
these
should
include
a
good
encyclopaedia
and
dictionaries
english
latin
and
greek
oates
was
generally
deep
in
napier
history
of
the
peninsular
war
and
some
of
us
found
herbert
paul
history
of
modern
england
a
great
most
of
us
managed
to
find
room
in
our
personal
gear
when
sledging
for
some
book
which
did
not
weigh
much
and
yet
would
last
scott
took
some
browning
on
the
polar
journey
though
i
only
saw
him
reading
it
once
wilson
took
maud
and
in
memoriam
bowers
always
had
so
many
weights
to
tally
and
observations
to
record
on
reaching
camp
that
i
feel
sure
he
took
no
reading
matter
bleak
house
was
the
most
successful
book
i
ever
took
away
sledging
though
a
volume
of
poetry
was
useful
because
it
gave
one
something
to
learn
by
heart
and
repeat
during
the
blank
hours
of
the
daily
march
when
the
idle
mind
is
all
too
apt
to
think
of
food
in
times
of
hunger
or
possibly
of
purely
imaginary
grievances
which
may
become
distorted
into
real
foundations
of
discord
under
the
abnormal
strain
of
living
for
months
in
the
unrelieved
company
of
three
other
men
if
your
companions
have
much
the
same
tastes
as
yourself
it
is
best
to
pool
your
allowance
of
weights
and
take
one
book
which
will
offer
a
wide
field
of
thought
and
discussion
i
have
heard
scott
and
wilson
bless
the
thought
which
led
them
to
take
darwin
origin
of
species
on
their
first
southern
journey
such
is
the
object
of
your
sledging
book
but
you
often
want
the
book
which
you
read
for
half
an
hour
before
you
go
to
sleep
at
winter
quarters
to
take
you
into
the
frivolous
fripperies
of
modern
social
life
which
you
may
not
know
and
may
never
wish
to
know
but
which
it
is
often
pleasant
to
read
about
and
never
so
much
so
as
when
its
charms
are
so
remote
as
to
be
entirely
tantalizing
scott
who
always
amazed
me
by
the
amount
of
work
he
got
through
without
any
apparent
effort
was
essentially
the
driving
force
of
the
expedition
in
the
hut
quietly
organizing
working
out
masses
of
figures
taking
the
greatest
interest
in
the
scientific
work
of
the
station
and
perhaps
turning
out
quite
by
the
way
an
elaborate
paper
on
an
abstruse
problem
in
the
neighbourhood
fond
of
his
pipe
and
a
good
book
browning
hardy
tess
was
one
of
his
favourites
galsworthy
barrie
was
one
of
his
greatest
friends
he
was
eager
to
accept
suggestions
if
they
were
workable
and
always
keen
to
sift
even
the
most
unlikely
theories
if
by
any
means
they
could
be
shaped
to
the
desired
end
a
quick
and
modern
brain
which
he
applied
with
thoroughness
to
any
question
of
practice
or
theory
essentially
an
attractive
personality
with
strong
likes
and
dislikes
he
excelled
in
making
his
followers
his
friends
by
a
few
words
of
sympathy
or
praise
i
have
never
known
anybody
man
or
woman
who
could
be
so
attractive
when
he
chose
sledging
he
went
harder
than
any
man
of
whom
i
have
ever
heard
men
never
realized
scott
until
they
had
gone
sledging
with
him
on
our
way
up
the
beardmore
glacier
we
were
going
at
top
pressure
some
seventeen
hours
out
of
the
and
when
we
turned
out
in
the
morning
we
felt
as
though
we
had
only
just
turned
in
by
lunch
time
we
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
through
in
the
afternoon
a
similar
amount
of
work
to
that
which
we
had
done
in
the
morning
a
cup
of
tea
and
two
biscuits
worked
wonders
and
the
first
two
hours
of
the
afternoon
march
went
pretty
well
indeed
they
were
the
best
hours
marching
of
the
day
but
by
the
time
we
had
been
going
some
or
hours
we
were
watching
scott
for
that
glance
to
right
and
left
which
betokened
the
search
for
a
good
camping
site
spell
oh
scott
would
cry
and
then
how
the
enemy
titus
to
oates
who
would
hopefully
reply
that
it
was
say
seven
oh
well
i
think
we
go
on
a
little
bit
more
scott
would
say
come
along
it
might
be
an
hour
or
more
before
we
halted
and
made
our
camp
sometimes
a
blizzard
had
its
silver
lining
scott
could
not
wait
however
welcome
a
blizzard
could
be
to
tired
bodies
i
speak
only
of
summer
sledging
to
scott
himself
any
delay
was
intolerable
and
it
is
hard
to
realize
how
difficult
waiting
may
be
to
one
in
a
responsible
position
it
was
our
simple
job
to
follow
to
get
up
when
we
were
roused
to
pull
our
hardest
to
do
our
special
work
as
thoroughly
and
quickly
as
possible
it
was
scott
who
had
to
organize
distances
and
weights
and
food
as
well
as
do
the
same
physical
work
as
ourselves
in
sledging
responsibility
and
physical
work
are
combined
to
an
extent
seldom
if
ever
found
elsewhere
his
was
a
subtle
character
full
of
lights
and
shades
england
knows
scott
as
a
hero
she
has
little
idea
of
him
as
a
man
he
was
certainly
the
most
dominating
character
in
our
not
uninteresting
community
indeed
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
carry
weight
in
any
gathering
of
human
beings
but
few
who
knew
him
realized
how
shy
and
reserved
the
man
was
and
it
was
partly
for
this
reason
that
he
so
often
laid
himself
open
to
misunderstanding
add
to
this
that
he
was
sensitive
femininely
sensitive
to
a
degree
which
might
be
considered
a
fault
and
it
will
be
clear
that
leadership
to
such
a
man
may
be
almost
a
martyrdom
and
that
the
confidence
so
necessary
between
leader
and
followers
which
must
of
necessity
be
based
upon
mutual
knowledge
and
trust
becomes
in
itself
more
difficult
it
wanted
an
understanding
man
to
appreciate
scott
quickly
to
others
knowledge
came
with
experience
he
was
not
a
strong
man
physically
and
was
in
his
youth
a
weakly
child
at
one
time
not
expected
to
live
but
he
was
well
proportioned
with
broad
shoulders
and
a
good
chest
a
stronger
man
than
wilson
weaker
than
bowers
or
seaman
evans
he
suffered
from
indigestion
and
told
me
at
the
top
of
the
beardmore
that
he
never
expected
to
go
on
during
the
first
stage
of
the
ascent
temperamentally
he
was
a
weak
man
and
might
very
easily
have
been
an
irritable
autocrat
as
it
was
he
had
moods
and
depressions
which
might
last
for
weeks
and
of
these
there
is
ample
evidence
in
his
diary
the
man
with
the
nerves
gets
things
done
but
sometimes
he
has
a
terrible
time
in
doing
them
he
cried
more
easily
than
any
man
i
have
ever
known
what
pulled
scott
through
was
character
sheer
good
grain
which
ran
over
and
under
and
through
his
weaker
self
and
clamped
it
together
it
would
be
stupid
to
say
he
had
all
the
virtues
he
had
for
instance
little
sense
of
humour
and
he
was
a
bad
judge
of
men
but
you
have
only
to
read
one
page
of
what
he
wrote
towards
the
end
to
see
something
of
his
sense
of
justice
for
him
justice
was
god
indeed
i
think
you
must
read
all
those
pages
and
if
you
have
read
them
once
you
will
probably
read
them
again
you
will
not
need
much
imagination
to
see
what
manner
of
man
he
was
and
notwithstanding
the
immense
fits
of
depression
which
attacked
him
scott
was
the
strongest
combination
of
a
strong
mind
in
a
strong
body
that
i
have
ever
known
and
this
because
he
was
so
weak
naturally
so
peevish
highly
strung
irritable
depressed
and
moody
practically
such
a
conquest
of
himself
such
vitality
such
push
and
determination
and
withal
in
himself
such
personal
and
magnetic
charm
he
was
naturally
an
idle
man
he
has
told
us
so
he
had
been
a
poor
man
and
he
had
a
horror
of
leaving
those
dependent
upon
him
in
difficulties
you
may
read
it
over
and
over
again
in
his
last
letters
and
messages
he
will
go
down
to
history
as
the
englishman
who
conquered
the
south
pole
and
who
died
as
fine
a
death
as
any
man
has
had
the
honour
to
die
his
triumphs
are
many
but
the
pole
was
not
by
any
means
the
greatest
of
them
surely
the
greatest
was
that
by
which
he
conquered
his
weaker
self
and
became
the
strong
leader
whom
we
went
to
follow
and
came
to
love
scott
had
under
him
this
first
year
in
his
main
party
a
total
of
officers
and
men
these
officers
may
be
divided
into
three
executive
officers
and
twelve
scientific
staff
but
the
distinction
is
very
rough
inasmuch
as
a
scientist
such
as
wilson
was
every
bit
as
executive
as
anybody
else
and
the
executive
officers
also
did
much
scientific
work
i
will
try
here
briefly
to
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
the
personality
and
activities
of
these
men
as
they
work
any
ordinary
day
in
the
hut
it
should
be
noticed
that
not
all
the
men
we
had
with
us
were
brought
to
do
sledging
work
some
were
chosen
rather
for
their
scientific
knowledge
than
for
their
physical
or
other
fitness
for
sledging
the
regular
sledgers
in
this
party
of
officers
were
scott
wilson
evans
bowers
oates
ponies
meares
dogs
atkinson
surgeon
wright
physicist
taylor
physiographer
debenham
geologist
gran
and
myself
while
day
was
to
drive
his
motors
as
far
as
they
would
go
on
the
polar
journey
this
leaves
simpson
who
was
the
meteorologist
and
whose
observations
had
of
necessity
to
be
continuous
nelson
whose
observations
into
marine
biology
temperatures
of
sea
salinity
currents
and
tides
came
under
the
same
heading
and
ponting
whose
job
was
photography
and
whose
success
in
this
art
everybody
recognizes
however
much
of
good
i
may
write
of
wilson
his
many
friends
in
england
those
who
served
with
him
on
the
ship
or
in
the
hut
and
most
of
all
those
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
sledge
with
him
for
it
is
sledging
which
is
far
the
greatest
test
will
all
be
dissatisfied
for
i
know
that
i
can
not
do
justice
to
his
value
if
you
knew
him
you
could
not
like
him
you
simply
had
to
love
him
bill
was
of
the
salt
of
the
earth
if
i
were
asked
what
quality
it
was
before
others
that
made
him
so
useful
and
so
lovable
i
think
i
should
answer
that
it
was
because
he
never
for
one
moment
thought
of
himself
in
this
respect
also
bowers
of
whom
i
will
speak
in
a
moment
was
most
extraordinary
and
in
passing
may
i
be
allowed
to
say
that
this
is
a
most
necessary
characteristic
of
a
good
antarctic
traveller
we
had
many
such
officers
and
seamen
and
the
success
of
the
expedition
was
in
no
small
measure
due
to
the
general
and
unselfish
way
in
which
personal
likes
and
dislikes
wishes
or
tastes
were
ungrudgingly
subordinated
to
the
common
weal
wilson
and
pennell
set
an
example
of
expedition
first
and
the
rest
nowhere
which
others
followed
ungrudgingly
it
pulled
us
through
more
than
one
difficulty
which
might
have
led
to
friction
wilson
was
a
man
of
many
parts
he
was
scott
man
he
was
the
expedition
chief
of
the
scientific
staff
he
was
a
doctor
of
george
hospital
and
a
zoologist
specializing
in
vertebrates
his
published
work
on
whales
penguins
and
seals
contained
in
the
scientific
report
of
the
discovery
expedition
is
still
the
best
available
and
makes
excellent
reading
even
to
the
on
the
outward
journey
of
the
terra
nova
he
was
still
writing
up
his
work
for
the
royal
commission
on
grouse
disease
the
published
report
of
which
he
never
lived
to
see
but
those
who
knew
him
best
will
probably
remember
wilson
by
his
paintings
rather
than
by
any
other
form
of
his
work
as
a
boy
his
father
sent
him
away
on
rambling
holidays
the
only
condition
being
that
he
should
return
with
a
certain
number
of
drawings
i
have
spoken
of
the
drawings
which
he
made
when
sledging
or
when
otherwise
engaged
away
from
painting
facilities
as
at
hut
point
he
brought
back
to
winter
quarters
a
filled
with
such
sketches
of
outlines
and
colours
of
sunsets
behind
the
western
mountains
of
lights
reflected
in
the
freezing
sea
or
in
the
glass
houses
of
the
ice
foot
of
the
steam
clouds
on
erebus
by
day
and
of
the
aurora
australis
by
night
next
door
to
scott
he
rigged
up
for
himself
a
table
consisting
of
two
venesta
cases
on
end
supporting
a
large
some
four
feet
square
on
this
he
set
to
work
systematically
to
paint
the
effects
which
he
had
seen
and
noted
he
painted
with
his
paper
wet
and
necessarily
therefore
he
worked
quickly
an
admirer
of
ruskin
he
wished
to
paint
what
he
saw
as
truly
as
possible
if
he
failed
to
catch
the
effect
he
wished
he
tore
up
the
picture
however
beautiful
the
result
he
had
obtained
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
faithfulness
of
his
colouring
the
pictures
recalled
then
and
will
still
recall
now
in
intimate
detail
the
effects
which
we
saw
together
as
to
the
accuracy
of
his
drawing
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
in
the
discovery
expedition
scott
wrote
on
his
southern
journey
wilson
is
the
most
indefatigable
person
when
it
is
fine
and
clear
at
the
end
of
our
fatiguing
days
he
will
spend
two
or
three
hours
seated
in
the
door
of
the
tent
sketching
each
detail
of
the
splendid
mountainous
to
the
west
his
sketches
are
most
astonishingly
accurate
i
have
tested
his
proportions
by
actual
angular
measurement
and
found
them
correct
in
addition
to
the
drawings
of
land
pack
icebergs
and
barrier
the
primary
object
of
which
was
scientific
and
geographical
wilson
has
left
a
number
of
paintings
of
atmospheric
phenomena
which
are
not
only
scientifically
accurate
but
are
also
exceedingly
beautiful
of
such
are
the
records
of
auroral
displays
parhelions
paraselene
lunar
halos
fog
bows
irridescent
clouds
refracted
images
of
mountains
and
mirage
generally
if
you
look
at
a
picture
of
a
parhelion
by
wilson
not
only
can
you
be
sure
that
the
mock
suns
circles
and
shafts
appeared
in
the
sky
as
they
are
shown
on
paper
but
you
can
also
rest
assured
that
the
number
of
degrees
between
say
the
sun
and
the
outer
ring
of
light
were
in
fact
such
as
he
has
represented
them
you
can
also
be
certain
in
looking
at
his
pictures
that
if
cirrus
cloud
is
shown
then
cirrus
and
not
stratus
cloud
was
in
the
sky
if
it
is
not
shown
then
the
sky
was
clear
it
is
accuracy
such
as
this
which
gives
an
exceptional
value
to
work
viewed
from
a
scientific
standpoint
mention
should
also
be
made
of
the
paintings
and
drawings
made
constantly
by
wilson
for
the
various
specialists
on
the
expedition
whenever
they
wished
for
colour
records
of
their
specimens
in
this
connection
the
paintings
of
fish
and
various
parasites
are
especially
valuable
i
am
not
specially
qualified
to
judge
wilson
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
but
if
you
want
accuracy
of
drawing
truth
of
colour
and
a
reproduction
of
the
soft
and
delicate
atmospheric
effects
which
obtain
in
this
part
of
the
world
then
you
have
them
here
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
painting
as
such
it
is
undeniable
that
an
artist
of
this
type
is
of
inestimable
value
to
an
expedition
which
is
doing
scientific
and
geographical
work
in
a
part
of
the
earth
wilson
himself
set
a
low
value
on
his
artistic
capacity
we
used
to
discuss
what
turner
would
have
produced
in
a
land
which
offered
colour
effects
of
such
beauty
if
we
urged
him
to
try
and
paint
some
peculiar
effect
and
he
felt
that
to
do
so
was
beyond
his
powers
he
made
no
scruple
of
saying
so
his
colour
is
clear
his
clean
and
he
handled
sledging
subjects
with
the
vigour
of
a
professional
who
knew
all
there
was
to
be
known
about
a
sledging
life
illustration
leading
ponies
on
the
barrier
wilson
del
scott
and
wilson
worked
hand
in
hand
to
further
the
scientific
objects
of
the
expedition
for
scott
though
no
specialist
in
any
one
branch
had
a
most
genuine
love
of
science
science
the
rock
foundation
of
all
effort
he
wrote
and
whether
discussing
ice
problems
with
wright
meteorology
with
simpson
or
geology
with
taylor
he
showed
not
only
a
mind
which
was
receptive
and
keen
to
learn
but
a
knowledge
which
was
quick
to
offer
valuable
suggestions
i
remember
pennell
condemning
anything
but
scientific
learning
in
dealing
with
the
problems
round
us
guesswork
was
his
argument
but
he
emphatically
made
an
exception
of
scott
who
had
an
uncanny
knack
of
hitting
upon
a
solution
over
and
over
again
in
his
diary
we
can
read
of
the
interest
he
took
in
pure
and
applied
science
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
this
side
of
an
expedition
in
high
northern
or
southern
latitudes
has
ever
been
more
fortunate
in
their
leader
wilson
own
share
in
the
scientific
results
is
more
obvious
because
he
was
the
director
of
the
work
but
no
published
reports
will
give
an
adequate
idea
of
the
ability
he
showed
in
the
various
interests
of
a
varied
community
nor
of
the
tact
he
displayed
in
dealing
with
the
difficulties
which
arose
above
all
his
judgment
was
excellent
and
scott
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
relied
upon
him
to
a
very
great
extent
the
value
of
judgment
in
a
land
where
a
wrong
decision
may
mean
disaster
as
well
as
loss
of
life
is
beyond
all
price
weather
in
which
changes
are
most
sudden
is
a
case
in
point
also
the
state
of
the
direction
to
be
followed
in
difficult
country
when
sledging
the
best
way
of
taking
crevassed
areas
when
they
must
be
crossed
and
all
the
ways
by
which
the
maximum
of
result
may
be
combined
with
the
minimum
of
danger
in
a
land
where
nature
is
sometimes
almost
too
big
an
enemy
to
fight
all
this
wants
judgment
and
if
possible
experience
wilson
could
supply
both
for
his
experience
was
as
wide
as
that
of
scott
and
i
have
constantly
known
scott
change
his
mind
after
a
talk
with
bill
for
the
rest
i
give
quotations
from
scott
diary
he
has
had
a
hand
in
almost
every
lecture
given
and
has
been
consulted
in
almost
every
effort
which
has
been
made
towards
the
solution
of
the
practical
or
theoretical
problems
of
our
polar
world
again
words
must
always
fail
me
when
i
talk
of
bill
wilson
i
believe
he
really
is
the
finest
character
i
ever
met
the
closer
one
gets
to
him
the
more
there
is
to
admire
every
quality
is
so
solid
and
dependable
can
not
you
imagine
how
that
counts
down
here
whatever
the
matter
one
knows
bill
will
be
sound
shrewdly
practical
intensely
loyal
and
quite
unselfish
add
to
this
a
wider
knowledge
of
persons
and
things
than
is
at
first
guessable
a
quiet
vein
of
humour
and
really
consummate
tact
and
you
have
some
idea
of
his
values
i
think
he
is
the
most
popular
member
of
the
party
and
that
is
saying
much
and
at
the
end
when
scott
himself
lay
dying
he
wrote
to
wilson
i
can
do
no
more
to
comfort
you
than
to
tell
you
that
he
died
as
he
lived
a
brave
true
man
the
best
of
comrades
and
staunchest
of
friends
physically
scott
had
been
a
delicate
boy
but
developed
into
a
strong
man
feet
inches
in
height
stone
lbs
in
weight
with
a
chest
measurement
of
inches
wilson
was
not
a
particularly
strong
man
on
leaving
with
the
discovery
he
was
but
lately
cured
of
consumption
yet
he
went
with
scott
to
his
farthest
south
and
helped
to
get
shackleton
back
alive
shackleton
owed
his
life
to
those
two
wilson
was
of
a
slimmer
more
athletic
build
a
great
walker
feet
inches
in
height
stones
in
weight
with
a
chest
measurement
of
inches
he
was
an
ideal
example
of
my
contention
which
i
believe
can
be
proved
many
times
over
to
be
a
fact
that
it
is
not
strength
of
body
but
rather
strength
of
will
which
carries
a
man
farthest
where
mind
and
body
are
taxed
at
the
same
time
to
their
utmost
limit
scott
was
years
of
age
at
his
death
and
wilson
bowers
was
of
a
very
different
build
aged
he
was
only
feet
inches
in
height
while
his
chest
measurement
which
i
give
more
as
a
general
guide
to
his
physique
than
for
any
other
reason
was
inches
and
his
weight
stones
he
was
recommended
to
scott
by
sir
clements
markham
who
was
dining
one
day
with
captain
on
the
worcester
on
which
ship
bowers
was
trained
bowers
was
then
home
from
india
and
the
talk
turned
to
the
antarctic
turned
to
sir
clements
in
the
course
of
conversation
and
alluding
to
bowers
said
here
is
a
man
who
will
be
leading
one
of
those
expeditions
some
day
he
lived
a
rough
life
after
passing
from
the
worcester
into
the
merchant
service
sailing
five
times
round
the
world
in
the
loch
torridon
thence
he
passed
into
the
service
of
the
royal
indian
marine
commanded
a
river
gunboat
on
the
irrawaddy
and
afterwards
served
on
fox
where
he
had
considerable
experience
often
in
open
boats
preventing
the
which
was
carried
on
by
the
afghans
in
the
persian
gulf
thence
he
came
to
us
it
is
at
any
rate
a
curious
fact
and
it
may
be
a
significant
one
that
bowers
who
enjoyed
a
greater
resistance
to
cold
than
any
man
on
this
expedition
joined
it
direct
from
one
of
the
hottest
places
on
the
globe
my
knowledge
is
insufficient
to
say
whether
it
is
possible
that
any
trace
can
be
found
here
of
cause
and
effect
especially
since
the
opposite
seems
to
be
the
more
common
experience
in
that
such
people
as
return
from
india
to
england
generally
find
the
english
winter
trying
i
give
the
fact
for
what
it
may
be
worth
remarking
only
that
the
cold
of
an
english
winter
is
generally
damp
while
that
of
the
antarctic
is
dry
so
far
at
any
rate
as
the
atmosphere
is
concerned
bowers
himself
always
professed
the
greatest
indifference
not
only
to
cold
but
also
to
heat
and
his
indifference
was
not
that
of
a
as
many
experiences
will
show
at
the
same
time
he
was
temperamentally
one
who
refused
to
admit
difficulties
indeed
if
he
did
not
actually
welcome
them
he
greeted
them
with
scorn
and
in
scorning
went
far
to
master
them
scott
believed
that
difficulties
were
made
to
be
overcome
bowers
certainly
believed
that
he
was
the
man
to
overcome
them
this
was
based
on
a
very
deep
and
broad
religious
feeling
and
carried
conviction
with
it
the
men
swore
by
him
both
on
the
ship
and
ashore
he
all
right
was
their
judgment
of
his
seamanship
which
was
admirable
i
like
being
with
birdie
because
i
always
know
where
i
am
was
the
remark
made
to
me
by
an
officer
one
evening
as
we
pitched
the
tent
we
had
just
been
spending
some
time
in
picking
up
a
depôt
which
a
less
able
man
might
well
have
missed
as
he
was
one
of
the
two
or
three
greatest
friends
of
my
life
i
find
it
hard
to
give
the
reader
a
mental
picture
of
birdie
bowers
which
will
not
appear
extravagant
there
were
times
when
his
optimism
appeared
forced
and
formal
though
i
believe
it
was
not
really
so
there
were
times
when
i
have
almost
hated
him
for
his
infernal
cheerfulness
to
those
accustomed
to
judge
men
by
the
standards
of
their
fashionable
and
corseted
bowers
appeared
crude
you
could
kill
that
man
if
you
took
a
to
him
was
the
comment
of
a
new
zealander
at
a
dance
at
christchurch
such
men
may
be
at
a
discount
in
conventional
life
but
give
me
a
snowy
waving
about
on
the
top
of
a
black
swell
a
ship
thrown
aback
a
almost
shattered
or
one
that
has
just
upset
their
supper
on
to
the
floorcloth
of
the
tent
which
is
much
the
same
thing
and
i
will
lie
down
and
cry
for
bowers
to
come
and
lead
me
to
food
and
safety
those
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
the
gods
loved
him
if
indeed
it
be
benevolent
to
show
your
favourites
a
clear
straight
shining
path
of
life
with
plenty
of
discomfort
and
not
a
little
pain
but
with
few
doubts
and
no
fears
browning
might
well
have
had
bowers
in
mind
when
he
wrote
of
one
who
never
turned
his
back
but
marched
breast
forward
never
doubted
clouds
would
break
never
dreamed
though
right
were
worsted
wrong
would
triumph
held
we
fall
to
rise
are
baffled
to
fight
better
sleep
to
wake
there
was
nothing
subtle
about
him
he
was
transparently
simple
straightforward
and
unselfish
his
capacity
for
work
was
prodigious
and
when
his
own
work
happened
to
take
less
than
his
full
time
he
characteristically
found
activity
in
serving
a
scientist
or
exercising
an
animal
so
he
used
to
help
to
send
up
balloons
with
instruments
attached
to
them
and
track
the
threads
which
led
to
them
when
detached
he
was
responsible
for
putting
up
the
three
outlying
meteorological
screens
and
read
them
more
often
than
anybody
else
at
times
he
looked
after
some
of
the
dogs
because
at
the
moment
there
was
nobody
else
whose
proper
job
it
happened
to
be
and
he
took
a
particular
fancy
to
one
of
our
strongest
huskies
called
krisravitza
which
is
the
russian
so
i
told
for
beautiful
this
fancy
originated
in
the
fact
that
to
kris
as
the
most
truculent
of
our
untamed
devils
fell
a
large
share
of
punishment
a
living
thing
in
trouble
be
it
dog
or
man
was
something
to
be
helped
being
the
smallest
man
in
the
party
he
schemed
to
have
allotted
to
him
the
largest
pony
available
both
for
the
depôt
and
polar
journeys
their
exercise
when
he
succeeded
was
a
matter
for
experiment
for
his
knowledge
of
horses
was
as
limited
as
his
love
of
animals
was
intense
he
started
to
exercise
his
second
pony
for
the
first
was
lost
on
the
floe
by
riding
him
i
soon
get
used
to
him
he
said
one
day
when
victor
had
just
deposited
him
in
the
to
say
nothing
of
his
getting
used
to
me
he
added
in
a
more
subdued
voice
this
was
work
and
as
such
more
congenial
than
that
which
had
to
be
done
inside
the
hut
but
his
most
important
work
was
indoors
and
he
brought
to
it
just
the
same
restless
enthusiasm
which
allowed
no
leisure
for
reading
or
relaxation
he
joined
as
one
of
the
ship
officers
in
london
given
charge
of
the
stores
the
way
in
which
he
stowed
the
ship
aroused
the
admiration
of
even
the
stevedores
especially
when
he
fell
down
the
main
hatch
one
morning
on
to
the
below
recovered
consciousness
in
about
half
a
minute
and
continued
work
for
the
rest
of
the
day
as
though
nothing
had
happened
as
the
voyage
out
proceeded
it
became
obvious
that
his
knowledge
of
the
stores
and
undefeatable
personality
would
be
of
great
value
to
the
shore
party
and
it
was
decided
that
he
should
land
to
his
great
delight
he
was
personally
responsible
for
all
food
supplies
whether
for
home
consumption
or
for
sledging
for
all
sledging
stores
and
the
distribution
of
weights
the
loading
of
sledges
the
consumption
of
coal
the
issue
of
clothing
bosun
stores
and
carpenter
stores
incidentally
the
keeper
of
stores
wanted
a
very
exact
knowledge
of
the
cases
which
contained
them
for
the
drifts
of
snow
soon
buried
them
as
they
lay
in
the
camp
outside
as
time
proved
his
capacity
scott
left
one
thing
after
another
in
bowers
hands
scott
was
a
leader
of
men
and
it
is
a
good
quality
in
such
to
delegate
work
from
themselves
on
to
those
who
prove
their
power
to
shoulder
the
burden
undoubtedly
bowers
saved
scott
a
great
deal
of
work
and
gave
him
time
which
he
might
not
otherwise
have
been
able
to
spare
to
interest
himself
in
the
scientific
work
of
the
station
greatly
to
its
benefit
and
do
a
good
deal
of
useful
writing
the
two
ways
in
which
bowers
helped
scott
most
this
winter
were
in
the
preparation
of
the
plans
and
the
working
out
of
the
weights
of
the
southern
journey
which
shall
be
discussed
later
and
in
the
routine
work
of
the
station
for
which
he
was
largely
responsible
and
which
ran
so
smoothly
that
i
am
unable
to
tell
the
reader
how
the
stores
were
issued
or
the
dinner
settled
by
what
rule
the
working
parties
for
fetching
ice
for
water
and
other
kindred
jobs
about
the
camp
were
ordered
they
just
happened
and
i
do
know
how
i
only
know
that
bowers
had
the
bunk
above
mine
in
the
hut
and
that
when
i
was
going
to
sleep
he
was
generally
standing
on
a
chair
and
using
his
own
bunk
as
a
desk
and
i
conclude
from
the
numerous
lists
of
stores
and
weights
which
are
now
in
my
hands
that
these
were
being
produced
anyway
the
job
was
done
and
the
fact
that
we
knew
nothing
about
it
goes
far
to
prove
how
efficiently
it
was
carried
through
for
him
difficulties
simply
did
not
exist
i
have
never
known
a
more
buoyant
virile
nature
scott
writings
abound
in
references
to
the
extraordinary
value
he
placed
upon
his
help
and
after
the
share
which
he
took
in
the
depôt
and
winter
journeys
it
was
clear
that
he
would
probably
be
taken
in
the
polar
party
as
indeed
proved
to
be
the
case
no
man
of
that
party
better
deserved
his
place
i
believe
he
is
the
hardest
traveller
that
ever
undertook
a
polar
journey
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
undaunted
the
standard
is
high
illustration
frozen
sea
and
cliffs
of
ice
bowers
gave
us
two
of
our
best
lectures
the
first
on
the
evolution
of
sledge
foods
at
the
end
of
which
he
discussed
our
own
rations
on
the
depôt
journey
and
made
suggestions
which
he
had
worked
out
scientifically
for
those
of
the
polar
journey
his
arguments
were
sound
enough
to
disarm
the
hostility
if
not
to
convert
to
his
opinions
at
least
one
scientist
who
had
come
to
hear
him
strongly
of
opinion
that
an
untrained
man
should
not
discuss
so
complex
a
subject
the
second
lecture
on
the
evolution
of
polar
clothing
was
also
the
fruit
of
much
work
the
general
conclusion
come
to
and
this
was
after
the
winter
journey
was
that
our
own
clothing
and
equipment
could
not
be
bettered
in
any
important
respect
though
it
must
be
always
understood
that
the
expedition
wore
clothing
and
not
furs
except
for
hands
and
feet
when
i
am
convinced
can
not
be
improved
upon
but
for
in
cold
weather
i
suspect
that
furs
may
be
better
the
table
was
cleared
after
supper
and
we
sat
round
it
for
these
lectures
three
times
a
week
there
was
no
compulsion
about
them
and
the
seamen
only
turned
up
for
those
which
especially
interested
them
such
as
meares
vivid
account
of
his
journeyings
on
the
eastern
or
chinese
borderland
of
thibet
this
land
is
inhabited
by
the
tribes
the
original
inhabitants
of
thibet
who
were
driven
out
by
the
present
inhabitants
and
meares
told
us
chiefly
of
the
lolos
who
killed
his
companion
brook
after
having
persuaded
him
that
they
were
friendly
and
anxious
to
help
him
he
had
no
pictures
and
very
makeshift
maps
yet
he
held
us
really
entranced
for
nearly
two
hours
by
the
sheer
interest
of
his
adventures
the
spirit
of
the
wanderer
is
in
meares
blood
he
has
no
happiness
but
in
the
wild
places
of
the
earth
i
have
never
met
so
extreme
a
type
even
now
he
is
looking
forward
to
getting
away
by
himself
to
hut
point
tired
already
of
our
scant
measure
of
civilization
three
lectures
a
week
were
too
many
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
the
second
winter
with
our
very
reduced
company
we
had
two
a
week
and
i
feel
sure
that
this
was
an
improvement
no
officer
nor
seaman
however
could
have
had
too
many
of
ponting
lectures
which
gave
us
glimpses
into
many
lands
illustrated
by
his
own
inimitable
slides
thus
we
lived
every
now
and
then
for
a
short
hour
in
burmah
india
or
japan
in
scenes
of
trees
and
flowers
and
feminine
charm
which
were
the
very
antithesis
of
our
present
situation
and
we
were
all
the
better
for
it
ponting
also
illustrated
the
subjects
of
other
lectures
with
slides
of
photographs
taken
during
the
autumn
or
from
printed
books
but
for
the
most
part
the
lecturers
were
perforce
content
with
designs
and
plans
drawn
on
paper
and
pinned
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
upon
a
large
propped
up
on
the
table
and
torn
off
sheet
by
sheet
from
the
practical
point
of
view
the
most
interesting
evening
to
us
was
that
on
which
scott
produced
the
plan
of
the
southern
journey
the
reader
may
ask
why
this
was
not
really
prepared
until
the
winter
previous
to
the
journey
itself
and
the
answer
clearly
is
that
it
was
impossible
to
arrange
more
than
a
rough
idea
until
the
autumn
sledging
had
taught
its
lesson
in
food
equipment
relative
reliability
of
dogs
ponies
and
men
and
until
the
changes
and
chances
of
our
life
showed
exactly
what
transport
would
be
available
for
the
following
sledging
season
thus
it
was
with
lively
anticipation
that
we
sat
down
on
may
an
advisory
committee
as
it
were
to
hear
and
give
our
suggestions
on
the
scheme
which
scott
had
evolved
in
the
early
weeks
of
the
winter
after
the
adventures
of
the
depôt
journey
and
the
loss
of
six
ponies
it
was
on
just
such
a
winter
night
too
that
scott
read
his
interesting
paper
on
the
ice
barrier
and
inland
ice
which
will
probably
form
the
basis
for
all
future
work
on
these
subjects
the
barrier
he
maintained
is
probably
afloat
and
covers
at
least
five
times
the
extent
of
the
north
sea
with
an
average
thickness
of
some
feet
though
it
has
only
been
possible
to
get
the
very
roughest
of
levels
according
to
the
movement
of
a
depôt
laid
in
the
discovery
days
the
barrier
moved
yards
towards
the
open
ross
sea
in
months
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
inclination
of
the
is
not
sufficient
to
cause
this
and
the
old
idea
that
the
glacier
streams
flowing
down
from
inland
plateau
provide
the
necessary
impetus
is
imperfect
it
was
simpson
suggestion
that
the
deposition
of
snow
on
the
barrier
leads
to
an
expansion
due
to
the
increase
of
weight
some
admittedly
vague
ideas
as
to
the
extent
and
character
of
the
inland
ended
a
clever
and
convincing
paper
which
contained
a
lot
of
good
reasoning
simpson
proved
an
excellent
lecturer
and
in
meteorology
and
in
the
explanation
of
the
many
instruments
with
which
his
corner
of
the
hut
was
full
he
possessed
subjects
which
interested
and
concerned
everybody
nelson
on
biological
problems
and
taylor
on
physiography
were
always
interesting
taylor
i
dreamt
of
your
lecture
last
night
how
could
i
live
so
long
in
the
world
and
not
know
something
of
so
fascinating
a
subject
thus
scott
on
the
morning
following
one
of
these
lectures
wright
on
ice
problems
radium
and
the
origin
of
matter
had
highly
technical
subjects
which
left
many
of
us
somewhat
befogged
but
atkinson
on
scurvy
had
an
audience
each
member
of
which
felt
that
he
had
a
personal
interest
in
the
subject
under
discussion
indeed
one
of
his
hearers
was
to
suffer
the
advanced
stage
of
this
dread
disease
within
six
months
atkinson
inclined
to
almroth
wright
theory
that
scurvy
is
due
to
an
acid
intoxication
of
the
blood
caused
by
bacteria
he
described
the
test
which
was
practised
on
us
monthly
and
before
and
after
sledge
journeys
in
this
the
blood
of
each
individual
is
drawn
and
various
strengths
of
dilute
sulphuric
acid
are
added
to
it
until
it
is
neutralized
the
healthy
man
showing
normal
to
while
the
man
with
scorbutic
signs
will
be
normal
to
according
to
the
stage
to
which
he
has
reached
the
only
thing
which
is
certain
to
stop
scurvy
is
fresh
vegetables
fresh
meat
when
life
is
otherwise
under
extreme
conditions
will
not
do
so
an
instance
being
the
siege
of
paris
when
they
had
plenty
of
horse
meat
in
voyages
were
being
ruined
by
scurvy
and
anson
lost
out
of
men
but
in
that
year
the
first
discoveries
were
made
and
was
introduced
by
blaine
from
this
time
scurvy
practically
disappeared
from
the
navy
and
there
was
little
scurvy
in
nelson
days
but
the
reason
is
not
clear
since
according
to
modern
research
only
helps
to
prevent
it
it
continued
in
the
merchant
service
and
in
a
decade
from
about
some
cases
were
admitted
into
the
dreadnought
hospital
whereas
in
the
decade
to
there
were
only
cases
we
had
at
cape
evans
a
salt
of
sodium
to
be
used
to
alkalize
the
blood
as
an
experiment
if
necessity
arose
darkness
cold
and
hard
work
are
in
atkinson
opinion
important
causes
of
scurvy
nansen
was
an
advocate
of
variety
of
diet
as
being
and
scott
recalled
a
story
told
him
by
nansen
which
he
had
never
understood
it
appeared
that
some
men
had
eaten
tins
of
tainted
food
some
of
it
was
slightly
tainted
some
of
it
was
really
bad
they
rejected
the
really
bad
ones
and
ate
those
only
which
were
slightly
tainted
and
of
course
said
nansen
they
should
have
eaten
the
worst
i
have
since
asked
nansen
about
this
story
he
tells
me
that
he
must
have
been
referring
to
the
crew
of
the
windward
the
ship
of
the
expedition
to
franz
josef
land
in
the
crew
of
this
ship
which
was
travelling
to
and
from
civilization
got
scurvy
though
the
land
party
kept
healthy
of
this
jackson
writes
in
the
case
of
the
crew
of
the
windward
i
fear
that
there
was
considerable
carelessness
in
the
use
of
tinned
meats
that
were
not
free
from
taint
although
tins
quite
gone
were
rejected
we
on
shore
largely
used
fresh
bear
meat
and
the
crew
of
the
windward
were
also
allowed
as
much
as
they
could
be
induced
to
eat
they
however
preferred
tinned
meat
several
days
a
week
to
a
diet
of
bear
meat
alone
and
some
of
the
crew
had
such
a
prejudice
against
bear
meat
as
to
refuse
to
eat
it
at
all
of
course
tainted
food
should
not
have
been
eaten
at
all
but
if
it
had
to
be
eaten
then
according
to
nansen
the
ptomaines
which
cause
scurvy
in
the
earlier
stages
of
decomposition
are
destroyed
by
the
ferment
which
forms
in
the
later
stages
they
should
therefore
have
taken
the
worst
tins
if
any
at
all
wilson
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
fresh
meat
alone
would
stop
scurvy
on
the
discovery
seal
meat
cured
it
as
to
scurvy
on
scott
discovery
southern
journey
he
made
light
of
it
however
during
the
winter
journey
i
remember
wilson
stating
that
shackleton
several
times
fell
in
a
faint
as
he
got
outside
the
tent
and
he
seems
to
have
been
seriously
ill
wilson
knew
that
he
himself
had
scurvy
some
time
before
the
others
knew
it
because
the
discoloration
of
his
gums
did
not
show
in
front
for
some
time
he
did
not
think
their
dogs
on
that
journey
had
scurvy
but
ptomaine
poisoning
from
fish
which
had
travelled
through
the
tropics
he
was
of
opinion
that
on
returning
from
sledge
journeys
on
the
discovery
they
had
wrongly
attributed
to
scurvy
such
symptoms
as
rash
on
the
body
swollen
legs
and
ankles
which
were
rather
the
result
of
excessive
fatigue
i
may
add
that
we
had
these
signs
on
our
return
from
the
winter
journey
then
there
were
lectures
on
geology
by
debenham
on
birds
and
beasts
and
also
on
sketching
by
wilson
on
surveying
by
evans
but
perhaps
no
lecture
remains
more
vividly
in
my
memory
than
that
given
by
oates
on
what
called
mismanagement
of
horses
of
course
to
all
of
us
who
were
relying
upon
the
ponies
for
the
first
stage
of
the
southern
journey
the
subject
was
of
interest
as
well
as
utility
but
the
greater
share
of
interest
centred
upon
the
lecturer
for
it
was
certainly
supposed
that
taciturn
titus
could
not
have
concealed
about
his
person
the
gift
of
the
gab
and
it
was
as
certain
as
it
could
be
that
the
whole
business
was
most
distasteful
to
him
imagine
our
delight
when
he
proved
to
have
an
elaborate
discourse
with
full
notes
of
which
no
one
had
seen
the
preparation
i
have
been
fortunate
in
securing
another
night
he
mentioned
amidst
mirth
and
proceeded
to
give
us
the
most
interesting
and
able
account
of
the
minds
and
bodies
of
horses
in
general
and
ours
in
particular
he
ended
with
a
story
of
a
at
which
he
was
a
guest
probably
against
his
will
a
young
lady
was
so
late
that
the
party
sat
down
to
dinner
without
waiting
longer
soon
she
arrived
covered
with
blushes
and
confusion
i
so
sorry
she
said
but
that
horse
was
the
limit
he
perhaps
it
was
a
jibber
suggested
her
hostess
to
help
her
out
no
he
was
a
i
heard
the
cabby
tell
him
so
several
times
titus
oates
was
the
most
cheerful
and
lovable
old
pessimist
that
you
could
imagine
often
after
tethering
and
feeding
our
ponies
at
a
night
camp
on
the
barrier
we
would
watch
the
coming
up
into
camp
i
give
these
dogs
ten
days
more
he
would
murmur
in
a
voice
such
as
some
people
used
when
they
heard
of
a
british
victory
i
am
acquainted
with
so
few
dragoons
that
i
do
not
know
their
general
characteristics
few
of
them
i
imagine
would
have
gone
about
with
the
slouch
which
characterized
his
method
of
locomotion
nor
would
many
of
them
have
dined
in
a
hat
so
shabby
that
it
was
picked
off
the
peg
and
passed
round
as
a
curiosity
he
came
to
look
after
the
horses
and
as
an
officer
in
the
inniskillings
he
no
doubt
had
excellent
training
but
his
skill
went
far
deeper
than
that
there
was
little
he
did
know
about
horses
and
the
pity
is
that
he
did
not
choose
our
ponies
for
us
in
siberia
we
should
have
had
a
very
different
lot
in
addition
to
his
general
charge
of
them
all
oates
took
as
his
own
pony
the
aforesaid
devil
christopher
for
the
southern
journey
and
for
previous
training
we
shall
hear
much
more
of
christopher
who
appeared
to
have
come
down
to
the
antarctic
to
initiate
the
inhabitants
into
all
the
vices
of
civilization
but
from
beginning
to
end
oates
management
of
this
animal
might
have
proved
a
model
to
any
governor
of
a
lunatic
asylum
his
tact
patience
and
courage
for
christopher
was
a
very
dangerous
beast
remain
some
of
the
most
vivid
recollections
of
a
very
gallant
gentleman
in
this
connection
let
me
add
that
no
animals
could
have
had
more
considerate
and
often
treatment
than
these
ponies
of
ours
granted
that
they
must
be
used
at
all
and
i
do
not
mean
to
enter
into
that
question
they
were
fed
trained
and
even
clothed
as
friends
and
companions
rather
than
as
beasts
of
burden
they
were
never
hit
a
condition
to
which
they
were
clearly
unaccustomed
they
lived
far
better
than
they
had
before
and
all
this
was
done
for
them
in
spite
of
the
conditions
under
which
we
ourselves
lived
we
became
very
fond
of
our
beasts
but
we
could
not
be
blind
to
their
faults
the
mind
of
a
horse
is
a
very
limited
concern
relying
almost
entirely
upon
memory
he
rivals
our
politicians
in
that
he
has
little
real
intellect
consequently
when
the
pony
was
faced
with
conditions
different
from
those
to
which
he
was
accustomed
he
showed
but
little
adaptability
and
when
you
add
to
this
frozen
harness
and
rugs
with
all
their
straps
and
buckles
and
lashings
an
incredible
facility
for
eating
anything
within
reach
including
his
own
tethering
ropes
and
the
headstalls
fringes
and
whatnots
of
his
companions
together
with
our
own
scanty
provisions
and
a
general
wish
to
do
anything
except
the
job
of
the
moment
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
pony
leader
lot
was
full
of
occasions
for
bad
temper
nevertheless
leaders
and
ponies
were
on
the
best
of
terms
excepting
always
christopher
which
is
really
not
surprising
when
you
come
to
think
that
most
of
the
leaders
were
sailors
whose
love
of
animals
is
profound
a
roof
was
built
against
the
northern
side
of
the
hut
and
the
ends
and
open
side
were
boarded
up
this
building
when
buttressed
by
the
bricks
of
coal
which
formed
our
fuel
and
drifted
up
with
snow
by
the
blizzards
formed
an
extremely
sheltered
and
even
warm
stable
the
ponies
stood
in
stalls
with
their
heads
towards
the
hut
and
divided
from
it
by
a
corridor
the
bars
which
kept
them
in
carried
also
their
food
boxes
they
lay
down
very
little
the
ground
was
too
cold
and
oates
was
of
opinion
that
litter
would
not
have
benefited
them
if
we
had
had
space
in
the
ship
to
bring
it
the
floor
of
their
stall
was
formed
of
the
gravel
on
which
the
hut
was
built
on
any
future
occasion
it
might
be
worth
consideration
whether
a
flooring
of
wood
might
add
to
their
comfort
as
you
walked
down
this
narrow
passage
you
passed
a
line
of
heads
many
of
which
would
have
a
nip
at
you
in
the
and
at
the
far
end
oates
had
rigged
up
for
himself
a
blubber
stove
more
elaborate
than
the
one
we
had
made
with
the
odds
and
ends
at
hut
point
but
in
principle
the
same
in
that
the
fids
of
sealskin
with
the
blubber
attached
to
them
were
placed
on
a
grid
and
the
heat
generated
caused
them
to
drop
their
oil
on
to
ashes
below
which
formed
the
fire
this
fire
not
only
warmed
the
stable
but
melted
the
snow
to
water
the
ponies
and
heated
their
bran
mashes
i
do
not
wonder
that
this
warm
companionable
home
appealed
to
their
minds
when
they
were
exercising
in
the
cold
dark
windy
they
were
always
trying
to
get
rid
of
their
leader
and
if
successful
generally
went
straight
back
to
the
hut
here
they
would
dodge
their
pursuers
until
such
time
as
they
were
sick
of
the
game
when
they
quietly
walked
into
the
stable
of
their
own
accord
to
be
welcomed
with
triumphant
squeals
and
kickings
by
their
companions
i
have
already
spoken
of
their
exercise
their
ration
during
the
winter
was
as
follows
chaff
noon
snow
chaff
and
oats
or
alternate
days
snow
hot
bran
mash
with
or
boiled
oats
and
chaff
finally
a
small
quantity
of
hay
in
the
spring
they
were
got
into
condition
on
hard
food
all
cold
and
by
a
carefully
increased
scale
of
exercise
during
the
latter
part
of
which
they
drew
sledges
with
very
light
loads
unfortunately
i
have
no
record
as
to
what
changes
of
feeding
stuffs
oates
would
have
made
if
it
had
been
possible
certainly
we
should
not
have
brought
the
bales
of
compressed
fodder
which
as
i
have
already
explained
was
theoretically
green
wheat
cut
young
but
practically
no
manner
of
use
as
a
food
though
of
some
use
perhaps
as
bulk
probably
he
would
have
used
hay
for
this
purpose
at
winter
quarters
had
our
stock
of
it
not
been
very
limited
for
hay
takes
up
too
much
room
on
a
ship
when
every
square
inch
of
stowage
space
is
of
value
the
original
weights
of
fodder
with
which
we
left
new
zealand
were
compressed
chaff
tons
hay
tons
tons
bran
tons
and
two
kinds
of
oats
of
which
the
white
was
better
than
the
black
we
wanted
more
bran
than
we
had
this
does
not
exhaust
our
list
of
feeding
stuffs
for
one
of
our
ponies
called
snippets
would
eat
blubber
and
so
far
as
i
know
it
agreed
with
him
we
left
new
zealand
with
nineteen
ponies
seventeen
of
which
were
destined
for
the
main
party
and
two
for
the
help
of
campbell
in
the
exploration
of
king
edward
vii
land
two
of
these
died
in
the
big
gale
at
sea
and
we
landed
fifteen
ponies
at
cape
evans
in
january
of
these
we
lost
six
on
the
depôt
journey
while
hackenschmidt
who
was
a
vicious
beast
sickened
and
wasted
away
in
our
absence
for
no
particular
reason
that
we
could
discover
until
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
shoot
him
thus
eight
only
out
of
the
original
seventeen
main
party
ponies
which
started
from
new
zealand
were
left
by
the
beginning
of
the
winter
i
have
told
how
during
our
absence
on
the
depôt
journey
the
ship
had
tried
to
land
campbell
with
his
two
ponies
on
king
edward
vii
land
but
had
been
prevented
from
reaching
it
by
pack
ice
coasting
back
in
search
of
a
landing
place
they
found
amundsen
in
the
bay
of
whales
under
the
circumstances
campbell
decided
not
to
land
his
party
there
but
to
try
and
land
on
the
north
coast
of
south
victoria
land
in
which
he
was
finally
successful
in
the
interval
the
ship
returned
to
cape
evans
with
the
news
and
since
he
was
of
opinion
that
his
animals
would
be
useless
to
him
in
that
region
he
took
the
opportunity
to
swim
the
two
ponies
ashore
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
for
the
ship
could
get
no
nearer
and
the
had
gone
thus
we
started
the
winter
with
campbell
two
ponies
jehu
and
chinaman
two
ponies
which
had
survived
the
depôt
journey
nobby
and
james
pigg
and
six
ponies
which
had
been
left
at
cape
evans
snatcher
snippets
bones
victor
michael
and
christopher
a
total
of
ten
of
these
ten
christopher
was
the
only
real
devil
with
vice
but
he
was
a
strong
pony
and
it
was
clear
that
he
would
be
useful
if
he
could
be
managed
bones
snatcher
victor
and
snippets
were
all
useful
ponies
michael
was
a
nice
beast
but
his
value
was
doubtful
chinaman
was
more
doubtful
still
and
it
was
questionable
sometimes
whether
jehu
would
be
able
to
pull
anything
at
all
this
leaves
nobby
and
jimmy
pigg
both
of
which
were
with
us
on
the
depôt
journey
nobby
was
the
best
of
the
two
he
was
the
only
survivor
from
the
disaster
and
i
am
not
sure
that
his
rescue
did
not
save
the
situation
with
regard
to
the
pole
jimmy
pigg
was
wending
his
way
slowly
back
from
corner
camp
at
this
time
and
so
was
also
saved
he
was
a
weak
pony
but
did
extremely
well
on
the
polar
journey
it
may
be
coincidence
that
these
two
ponies
the
only
ponies
which
had
gained
previous
sledging
experience
did
better
according
to
their
strength
than
any
of
the
others
but
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
their
familiarity
with
the
conditions
on
the
barrier
was
of
great
value
to
them
doing
away
with
much
useless
worry
and
exhaustion
and
so
it
will
be
understood
with
what
feelings
of
anxiety
any
cases
of
injury
or
illness
to
our
ponies
were
regarded
the
cases
of
injury
were
few
and
of
small
importance
thanks
to
the
care
with
which
they
were
exercised
in
the
dark
on
ice
which
was
by
no
means
free
from
inequalities
let
me
explain
in
passing
that
this
ice
is
almost
always
covered
by
at
least
a
thin
layer
of
drifted
snow
and
for
the
most
part
is
not
slippery
every
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
great
banging
and
crashing
heard
through
the
walls
of
the
hut
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
watchman
would
run
out
oates
put
on
his
boots
scott
be
audibly
uneasy
it
was
generally
bones
or
chinaman
kicking
their
stalls
perhaps
to
keep
themselves
warm
but
by
the
time
the
watchman
had
reached
the
stable
he
would
be
met
by
a
line
of
sleepy
faces
blinking
at
him
in
the
light
of
the
electric
torch
each
saying
plainly
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
responsible
for
a
breach
of
the
peace
but
antics
might
easily
lead
to
accidents
and
more
than
once
a
pony
was
found
twisted
up
in
some
way
in
his
stall
or
even
to
have
fallen
to
the
ground
their
heads
were
tied
on
either
side
to
the
stanchions
of
the
stall
and
so
if
they
tried
to
lie
down
complications
might
arise
more
alarming
was
the
one
serious
case
of
illness
preceded
by
a
slighter
case
of
a
similar
nature
in
another
pony
jimmy
pigg
had
a
slight
attack
of
colic
in
the
middle
of
june
but
he
was
feeding
all
right
again
during
the
evening
of
the
same
day
it
was
at
noon
july
that
bones
went
off
his
feed
this
was
followed
by
spasms
of
acute
pain
every
now
and
again
he
attempted
to
lie
down
and
oates
eventually
thought
it
was
wiser
to
allow
him
to
do
so
once
down
his
head
gradually
drooped
until
he
lay
at
length
every
now
and
then
twitching
very
horribly
with
the
pain
and
from
time
to
time
raising
his
head
and
even
scrambling
to
his
legs
when
it
grew
intense
i
do
think
i
ever
realized
before
how
pathetic
a
horse
could
be
under
such
conditions
no
sound
escapes
him
his
misery
can
only
be
indicated
by
those
distressing
spasms
and
by
dumb
movement
of
the
head
with
a
patient
expression
always
suggestive
of
appeal
towards
midnight
it
seemed
that
we
were
to
lose
him
and
apart
from
other
considerations
we
knew
that
unless
we
could
keep
all
the
surviving
animals
alive
the
risks
of
failure
in
the
coming
journey
were
much
increased
it
was
shortly
after
midnight
when
i
scott
was
told
that
the
animal
seemed
a
little
easier
at
i
was
again
in
the
stable
and
found
the
improvement
had
been
maintained
the
horse
still
lay
on
its
side
with
outstretched
head
but
the
spasms
had
ceased
its
eye
looked
less
distressed
and
its
ears
pricked
to
occasional
noises
as
i
stood
looking
it
suddenly
raised
its
head
and
rose
without
effort
to
its
legs
then
in
a
moment
as
though
some
bad
dream
had
passed
it
began
to
nose
at
some
hay
and
at
its
neighbour
within
three
minutes
it
had
drunk
a
bucket
of
water
and
had
started
to
feed
the
immediate
cause
of
the
trouble
was
indicated
by
a
small
ball
of
hay
covered
with
mucus
and
containing
so
far
not
very
serious
but
unfortunately
attached
to
this
mass
was
a
strip
of
the
lining
of
the
intestine
the
recovery
of
bones
was
uninterrupted
two
day
later
another
pony
went
off
his
feed
and
lay
down
but
was
soon
well
again
considerable
speculation
as
to
the
original
cause
of
this
illness
never
found
a
satisfactory
answer
some
traced
it
to
a
want
of
ventilation
and
it
is
necessary
to
say
that
both
the
ponies
who
were
ill
stood
next
to
the
blubber
stove
at
any
rate
a
big
ventilator
was
fitted
and
more
fresh
air
let
in
others
traced
it
to
the
want
of
water
supposing
that
the
animals
would
not
eat
as
much
snow
as
they
would
have
drunk
water
the
easy
remedy
for
this
was
to
give
them
water
instead
of
snow
we
also
gave
them
more
salt
than
they
had
had
before
whatever
the
cause
may
have
been
we
had
no
more
of
this
colic
and
the
improvement
in
their
condition
until
we
started
sledging
was
uninterrupted
all
the
ponies
were
treated
for
worms
it
was
also
found
that
they
had
lice
which
were
eradicated
after
some
time
and
difficulty
by
a
wash
of
tobacco
and
water
i
know
that
oates
wished
that
he
had
clipped
the
ponies
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
believing
that
they
would
have
grown
far
better
coats
if
this
had
been
done
he
also
would
have
wished
for
a
loose
box
for
each
pony
no
account
of
the
ponies
would
be
complete
without
mention
of
our
russian
pony
boy
anton
he
was
small
in
height
but
he
was
exceedingly
strong
and
had
a
chest
measurement
of
inches
illustration
erebus
and
lands
end
illustration
erebus
behind
great
razorback
i
believe
both
anton
and
dimitri
the
russian
dog
driver
were
brought
originally
to
look
after
the
ponies
and
dogs
on
their
way
from
siberia
to
new
zealand
but
they
proved
such
good
fellows
and
so
useful
that
we
were
very
glad
to
take
them
on
the
strength
of
the
landing
party
i
fear
that
anton
at
any
rate
did
not
realize
what
he
was
in
for
when
we
arrived
at
cape
crozier
in
the
ship
on
our
voyage
south
and
he
saw
the
two
great
peaks
of
ross
island
in
front
and
the
barrier
cliff
disappearing
in
an
unbroken
wall
below
the
eastern
horizon
he
imagined
that
he
reached
the
south
pole
and
was
suitably
elated
when
the
darkness
of
the
winter
closed
down
upon
us
this
apparently
unnatural
order
of
things
so
preyed
upon
his
superstitious
mind
that
he
became
seriously
alarmed
where
the
joined
the
land
in
front
of
the
hut
was
of
course
a
working
crack
caused
by
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
tide
sometimes
the
found
its
way
up
and
anton
was
convinced
that
the
weird
phosphorescent
lights
which
danced
up
out
of
the
sea
were
devils
in
propitiation
we
found
that
he
had
sacrificed
to
them
his
most
cherished
luxury
his
scanty
allowance
of
cigarettes
which
he
had
literally
cast
upon
the
waters
in
the
darkness
it
was
natural
that
his
thoughts
should
turn
to
the
comforts
of
his
siberian
home
and
the
wife
whom
he
was
going
to
marry
there
and
when
it
became
clear
that
a
another
year
would
be
spent
in
the
south
his
mind
was
troubled
and
so
he
went
to
oates
and
asked
him
if
i
go
away
at
the
end
of
this
year
will
captain
scott
disinherit
me
in
order
to
try
and
express
his
idea
for
he
knew
little
english
he
had
some
days
before
been
asking
what
we
called
it
when
a
father
died
and
left
his
son
nothing
poor
anton
he
looked
long
and
anxiously
for
the
ship
and
with
his
on
his
shoulder
was
amongst
the
first
to
trek
across
the
ice
to
meet
her
having
asked
for
and
obtained
a
job
of
work
there
was
no
happier
man
on
board
he
never
left
her
until
she
reached
new
zealand
nevertheless
he
was
always
cheerful
always
working
and
a
most
useful
addition
to
our
small
community
it
is
still
usual
to
talk
of
people
living
in
complete
married
happiness
when
we
really
mean
so
bernard
shaw
tells
me
that
they
confine
their
quarrels
to
thursday
nights
if
then
i
say
that
we
lived
this
life
for
nearly
three
years
from
the
day
when
we
left
england
until
the
day
we
returned
to
new
zealand
without
any
friction
of
any
kind
i
shall
be
supposed
to
be
making
a
formal
statement
of
somewhat
limited
truth
may
i
say
that
there
is
really
no
formality
about
it
and
nothing
but
the
truth
to
be
absolutely
accurate
i
must
admit
to
having
seen
a
man
in
a
very
state
on
one
occasion
that
was
all
it
did
last
and
may
have
been
well
justified
for
aught
i
know
i
have
forgotten
what
it
was
all
about
why
we
should
have
been
more
fortunate
than
polar
travellers
in
general
it
is
hard
to
say
but
undoubtedly
a
very
powerful
reason
was
that
we
had
no
idle
hours
there
was
no
time
to
quarrel
before
we
went
south
people
were
always
saying
you
will
get
fed
up
with
one
another
what
will
you
do
all
the
dark
winter
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
difficulty
was
to
get
through
with
the
work
often
after
working
all
through
a
long
officers
carried
on
as
a
matter
of
course
through
the
following
day
in
order
to
clear
off
arrears
there
was
little
reading
or
general
relaxation
during
the
day
certainly
not
before
supper
if
at
all
and
while
no
fixed
hours
for
work
were
laid
down
the
custom
was
general
that
all
hours
between
breakfast
and
supper
should
be
so
used
our
small
company
was
desperately
keen
to
obtain
results
the
youngest
and
most
cynical
pessimist
must
have
had
cause
for
wonder
to
see
a
body
of
healthy
and
not
unintellectual
men
striving
thus
to
add
their
small
quota
of
scientific
and
geographical
knowledge
to
the
sum
total
of
the
world
with
no
immediate
prospect
of
its
practical
utility
laymen
and
scientists
alike
were
determined
to
attain
the
objects
to
gain
which
they
had
set
forth
and
i
believe
that
in
a
vague
intangible
way
there
was
an
ideal
in
front
of
and
behind
this
work
it
is
really
not
desirable
for
men
who
do
not
believe
that
knowledge
is
of
value
for
its
own
sake
to
take
up
this
kind
of
life
the
question
constantly
put
to
us
in
civilization
was
and
still
is
what
is
the
use
is
there
gold
or
is
there
coal
the
commercial
spirit
of
the
present
day
can
see
no
good
in
pure
science
the
english
manufacturer
is
not
interested
in
research
which
will
not
give
him
a
financial
return
within
one
year
the
city
man
sees
in
it
only
so
much
energy
wasted
on
unproductive
work
truly
they
are
bound
to
the
wheel
of
conventional
life
now
unless
a
man
believes
that
such
a
view
is
wrong
he
has
no
business
to
be
south
our
magnetic
and
meteorological
work
may
i
suppose
have
a
fairly
immediate
bearing
upon
commerce
and
shipping
otherwise
i
can
not
imagine
any
branch
of
our
labours
which
will
do
more
at
present
than
swell
the
central
pool
of
unapplied
knowledge
the
members
of
this
expedition
believed
that
it
was
worth
while
to
discover
new
land
and
new
life
to
reach
the
southern
pole
of
the
earth
to
make
elaborate
meteorological
and
magnetic
observations
and
extended
geological
surveys
with
all
the
other
branches
of
research
for
which
we
were
equipped
they
were
prepared
to
suffer
great
hardship
and
some
of
them
died
for
their
beliefs
without
such
ideals
the
spirit
which
certainly
existed
in
our
small
community
would
have
been
impossible
but
if
the
reasons
for
this
happy
state
of
our
domestic
life
were
due
largely
to
the
adaptability
and
keenness
of
the
members
of
our
small
community
i
doubt
whether
the
frictions
which
have
caused
other
expeditions
to
be
less
comfortable
than
they
might
have
been
would
have
been
avoided
in
our
case
had
it
not
been
for
the
qualities
in
some
of
our
men
which
set
a
fashion
of
hard
work
without
any
thought
of
personal
gain
with
all
its
troubles
it
is
a
good
life
we
came
back
from
the
barrier
telling
one
another
we
loathed
the
place
and
nothing
on
earth
should
make
us
return
but
now
the
barrier
comes
back
to
us
with
its
clean
open
life
and
the
smell
of
the
cooker
and
its
soft
sound
sleep
so
much
of
the
trouble
of
this
world
is
caused
by
memories
for
we
only
remember
half
we
have
forgotten
or
nearly
forgotten
how
the
loss
of
a
biscuit
crumb
left
a
sense
of
injury
which
lasted
for
a
week
how
the
greatest
friends
were
so
much
on
one
another
nerves
that
they
did
not
speak
for
days
for
fear
of
quarrelling
how
angry
we
felt
when
the
cook
ran
short
on
the
weekly
bag
how
sick
we
were
after
the
first
meals
when
we
could
eat
as
much
as
we
liked
how
anxious
we
were
when
a
man
fell
ill
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
home
and
we
had
a
fortnight
of
thick
weather
and
had
to
find
our
depôts
or
starve
we
remember
the
cry
of
ho
which
preceded
the
cup
of
tea
which
gave
us
five
more
miles
that
evening
the
good
fellowship
which
completed
our
supper
after
safely
crossing
a
bad
patch
of
crevasses
the
square
inch
of
plum
pudding
which
celebrated
our
christmas
day
the
chanties
we
sang
all
over
the
barrier
as
we
marched
our
ponies
along
we
travelled
for
science
those
three
small
embryos
from
cape
crozier
that
weight
of
fossils
from
buckley
island
and
that
mass
of
material
less
spectacular
but
gathered
just
as
carefully
hour
by
hour
in
wind
and
drift
darkness
and
cold
were
striven
for
in
order
that
the
world
may
have
a
little
more
knowledge
that
it
may
build
on
what
it
knows
instead
of
on
what
it
thinks
some
of
our
men
were
ambitious
some
wanted
money
others
a
name
some
a
help
up
the
scientific
ladder
others
an
why
not
but
we
had
men
who
did
not
care
a
rap
for
money
or
fame
i
do
not
believe
it
mattered
to
wilson
when
he
found
that
amundsen
had
reached
the
pole
a
few
days
before
him
not
much
pennell
would
have
been
very
bored
if
you
had
given
him
a
knighthood
lillie
bowers
priestley
debenham
atkinson
and
many
others
were
much
the
same
but
there
is
no
love
lost
between
the
class
of
men
who
go
out
and
do
such
work
and
the
authorities
at
home
who
deal
with
their
collections
i
remember
a
conversation
in
the
hut
during
the
last
bad
winter
men
were
arguing
fiercely
that
professionally
they
lost
a
lot
by
being
down
south
that
they
fell
behindhand
in
current
work
got
out
of
the
running
and
so
forth
there
is
a
lot
in
that
and
then
the
talk
went
on
to
the
publication
of
results
and
the
way
in
which
they
would
wish
them
done
a
said
he
was
going
to
hand
over
his
work
to
be
mucked
up
by
such
and
such
a
body
at
home
b
said
he
was
going
to
have
his
buried
in
museum
never
to
be
seen
again
c
said
he
would
jolly
well
publish
his
own
results
in
the
scientific
journals
and
the
ears
of
the
armchair
scientists
who
might
deal
with
our
specimens
and
observations
should
have
been
warm
that
night
at
the
time
i
felt
a
little
indignant
it
seemed
to
me
that
these
men
ought
to
think
themselves
lucky
to
be
down
south
at
all
there
were
thousands
who
would
have
like
to
take
their
place
but
now
i
understand
quite
a
lot
more
than
i
did
then
science
is
a
big
thing
if
you
can
travel
a
winter
journey
in
her
cause
and
not
regret
it
i
am
not
sure
she
is
not
bigger
still
if
you
can
have
dealings
with
scientists
and
continue
to
follow
in
her
path

the

journey
ah
but
a
man
reach
should
exceed
his
grasp
or
what
a
heaven
for
browning
del
to
me
and
to
every
one
who
has
remained
here
the
result
of
this
effort
is
the
appeal
it
makes
to
our
imagination
as
one
of
the
most
gallant
stories
in
polar
history
that
men
should
wander
forth
in
the
depth
of
a
polar
night
to
face
the
most
dismal
cold
and
the
fiercest
gales
in
darkness
is
something
new
that
they
should
have
persisted
in
this
effort
in
spite
of
every
adversity
for
five
full
weeks
is
heroic
it
makes
a
tale
for
our
generation
which
i
hope
may
not
be
lost
in
the
telling

at

the

of
three
men
set
out
with
a
total
weight
of
lbs
to
draw
the
ski
and
sticks
in
the
above
list
being
left
behind
at
the
last
moment
it
was
impossible
to
load
the
total
bulk
upon
one
sledge
and
so
two
sledges
were
taken
one
toggled
on
behind
the
other
while
this
made
the
packing
and
handling
of
the
gear
much
easier
it
nearly
doubled
the
friction
surface
against
which
the
party
had
to
pull
midwinter
a
hard
night
clear
with
a
blue
sky
so
deep
that
it
looks
black
the
stars
are
steel
points
the
glaciers
burnished
silver
the
snow
rings
and
thuds
to
your
footfall
the
ice
is
cracking
to
the
falling
temperature
and
the
tide
crack
groans
as
the
water
rises
and
over
all
wave
upon
wave
fold
upon
fold
there
hangs
the
curtain
of
the
aurora
as
you
watch
it
fades
away
and
then
quite
suddenly
a
great
beam
flashes
up
and
rushes
to
the
zenith
an
arch
of
palest
green
and
orange
a
tail
of
flaming
gold
again
it
falls
fading
away
into
great
searchlight
beams
which
rise
behind
the
smoking
crater
of
mount
erebus
and
again
the
spiritual
veil
is
drawn
here
at
the
roaring
loom
of
time
i
ply
and
weave
for
god
the
garment
thou
seest
him
by
inside
the
hut
are
orgies
we
are
very
merry
and
indeed
why
not
the
sun
turns
to
come
back
to
us
and
such
a
day
comes
only
once
a
year
after
dinner
we
had
to
make
speeches
but
instead
of
making
a
speech
bowers
brought
in
a
wonderful
christmas
tree
made
of
split
bamboos
and
a
ski
stick
with
feathers
tied
to
the
end
of
each
branch
candles
sweets
preserved
fruits
and
the
most
absurd
toys
of
which
bill
was
the
owner
titus
got
three
things
which
pleased
him
immensely
a
sponge
a
whistle
and
a
which
went
off
when
he
pressed
in
the
butt
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
went
round
asking
whether
you
were
sweating
no
yes
you
are
he
said
and
wiped
your
face
with
the
sponge
if
you
want
to
please
me
very
much
you
will
fall
down
when
i
shoot
you
he
said
to
me
and
then
he
went
round
shooting
everybody
at
intervals
he
blew
the
whistle
he
danced
the
lancers
with
anton
and
anton
whose
dancing
puts
that
of
the
russian
ballet
into
the
shade
continually
apologized
for
not
being
able
to
do
it
well
enough
ponting
gave
a
great
lecture
with
slides
which
he
had
made
since
we
arrived
many
of
which
meares
had
coloured
when
one
of
these
came
up
one
of
us
would
shout
who
coloured
that
and
another
would
cry
meares
then
uproar
it
was
impossible
for
ponting
to
speak
we
had
a
milk
punch
when
scott
proposed
the
eastern
party
and
clissold
the
cook
proposed
good
old
true
milk
titus
blew
away
the
ball
of
his
gun
i
blew
it
into
the
cerulean
how
doth
homer
have
it
cerulean
azure
hence
erebus
as
we
turned
in
he
said
cherry
are
you
responsible
for
your
actions
and
when
i
said
yes
he
blew
loudly
on
his
whistle
and
the
last
thing
i
remembered
was
that
he
woke
up
meares
to
ask
him
whether
he
was
fancy
free
it
was
a
magnificent
bust
five
days
later
and
three
men
one
of
whom
at
any
rate
is
feeling
a
little
frightened
stand
panting
and
sweating
out
in
mcmurdo
sound
they
have
two
sledges
one
tied
behind
the
other
and
these
sledges
are
piled
high
with
and
camping
equipment
six
weeks
provisions
and
a
venesta
case
full
of
scientific
gear
for
pickling
and
preserving
in
addition
there
is
a
pickaxe
an
alpine
rope
a
large
piece
of
green
willesden
canvas
and
a
bit
of
board
scott
amazed
remark
when
he
saw
our
sledges
two
hours
ago
bill
why
are
you
taking
all
this
oil
pointing
to
the
six
cans
lashed
to
the
tray
on
the
second
sledge
had
a
bite
in
it
our
weights
for
such
travelling
are
enormous
lbs
a
man
it
is
but
it
is
pitchy
dark
and
it
is
not
warm
as
we
rested
my
mind
went
back
to
a
dusty
dingy
office
in
victoria
street
some
fifteen
months
ago
i
want
you
to
come
said
wilson
to
me
and
then
i
want
to
go
to
cape
crozier
in
the
winter
and
work
out
the
embryology
of
the
emperor
penguins
but
i
not
saying
much
about
it
it
might
never
come
off
well
this
was
better
than
victoria
street
where
the
doctors
had
nearly
refused
to
let
me
go
because
i
could
only
see
the
people
across
the
road
as
vague
blobs
walking
then
bill
went
and
had
a
talk
with
scott
about
it
and
they
said
i
might
come
if
i
was
prepared
to
take
the
additional
risk
at
that
time
i
would
have
taken
anything
after
the
depôt
journey
at
hut
point
walking
over
that
beastly
slippery
sloping
which
i
always
imagined
would
leave
me
some
day
in
the
sea
bill
asked
me
whether
i
would
go
with
him
and
who
else
for
a
third
there
can
have
been
little
doubt
whom
we
both
wanted
and
that
evening
bowers
had
been
asked
of
course
he
was
mad
to
come
and
here
we
were
this
winter
travel
is
a
new
and
bold
venture
wrote
scott
in
the
hut
that
night
but
the
right
men
have
gone
to
attempt
it
i
do
know
there
never
could
have
been
any
doubt
about
bill
and
birdie
probably
lashly
would
have
made
the
best
third
but
bill
had
a
prejudice
against
seamen
for
a
journey
like
this
they
do
take
enough
care
of
themselves
and
they
not
look
after
their
clothes
but
lashly
was
wonderful
if
scott
had
only
taken
a
party
and
lashly
to
the
pole
what
is
this
venture
why
is
the
embryo
of
the
emperor
penguin
so
important
to
science
and
why
should
three
sane
and
explorers
be
sledging
away
on
a
winter
night
to
a
cape
which
has
only
been
visited
before
in
daylight
and
then
with
very
great
difficulty
i
have
explained
more
fully
in
the
introduction
to
this
book
the
knowledge
the
world
possessed
at
this
time
of
the
emperor
penguin
mainly
due
to
wilson
but
it
is
because
the
emperor
is
probably
the
most
primitive
bird
in
existence
that
the
working
out
of
his
embryology
is
so
important
the
embryo
shows
remains
of
the
development
of
an
animal
in
former
ages
and
former
states
it
recapitulates
its
former
lives
the
embryo
of
an
emperor
may
prove
the
missing
link
between
birds
and
the
reptiles
from
which
birds
have
sprung
only
one
rookery
of
emperor
penguins
had
been
found
at
this
date
and
this
was
on
the
inside
a
little
bay
of
the
barrier
edge
at
cape
crozier
which
was
guarded
by
miles
of
some
of
the
biggest
pressure
in
the
antarctic
chicks
had
been
found
in
september
and
wilson
reckoned
that
the
eggs
must
be
laid
in
the
beginning
of
july
and
so
we
started
just
after
midwinter
on
the
weirdest
expedition
that
has
ever
been
or
ever
will
be
illustration
emperors
but
the
sweat
was
freezing
in
our
clothing
and
we
moved
on
all
we
could
see
was
a
black
patch
away
to
our
left
which
was
turk
head
when
this
disappeared
we
knew
that
we
had
passed
glacier
tongue
which
unseen
by
us
eclipsed
the
rocks
behind
and
then
we
camped
for
lunch
that
first
camp
only
lives
in
my
memory
because
it
began
our
education
of
camp
work
in
the
dark
had
we
now
struck
the
blighting
temperature
which
we
were
to
meet
there
was
just
enough
wind
to
make
us
want
to
hurry
down
harness
each
man
to
a
strap
on
the
sledge
quick
with
the
the
bags
to
hold
it
down
now
a
good
spread
with
the
bamboos
and
the
tent
inner
lining
hold
them
cherry
and
over
with
the
outer
covering
snow
on
to
the
skirting
and
inside
with
the
cook
with
his
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
that
is
how
we
tied
it
that
is
the
way
we
were
accustomed
to
do
it
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
when
the
sun
was
still
high
or
at
any
rate
only
setting
sledging
on
the
barrier
in
spring
and
summer
and
autumn
pulling
our
hands
from
our
mitts
when
necessary
plenty
of
time
to
warm
up
afterwards
in
the
days
when
we
took
pride
in
getting
our
tea
boiling
within
twenty
minutes
of
throwing
off
our
harness
when
the
man
who
wanted
to
work
in
his
fur
mitts
was
thought
a
bit
too
slow
but
now
it
work
we
shall
have
to
go
a
bit
slower
said
bill
and
we
shall
get
more
used
to
working
in
the
dark
at
this
time
i
remember
i
was
still
trying
to
wear
spectacles
we
spent
that
night
on
the
finding
that
we
were
too
far
in
towards
castle
rock
and
it
was
not
until
the
following
afternoon
that
we
reached
and
lunched
at
hut
point
i
speak
of
day
and
night
though
they
were
much
the
same
and
later
on
when
we
found
that
we
could
not
get
the
work
into
a
day
we
decided
to
carry
on
as
though
such
a
convention
did
not
exist
as
in
actual
fact
it
did
not
we
had
already
realized
that
cooking
under
these
conditions
would
be
a
bad
job
and
that
the
usual
arrangement
by
which
one
man
was
cook
for
the
week
would
be
intolerable
we
settled
to
be
cook
alternately
day
by
day
for
food
we
brought
only
pemmican
and
biscuit
and
butter
for
drink
we
had
tea
and
we
drank
hot
water
to
turn
in
on
pulling
out
from
hut
point
that
evening
we
brought
along
our
heavy
loads
on
the
two
sledges
with
comparative
ease
it
was
the
first
and
though
we
did
not
know
it
then
the
only
bit
of
good
pulling
we
were
to
have
good
pulling
to
the
sledge
traveller
means
easy
pulling
away
we
went
round
cape
armitage
and
eastwards
we
knew
that
the
barrier
edge
was
in
front
of
us
and
also
that
the
of
the
had
left
the
face
of
it
as
a
low
perpendicular
cliff
we
had
therefore
to
find
a
place
where
the
snow
had
formed
a
drift
this
we
came
right
up
against
and
met
quite
suddenly
a
very
keen
wind
flowing
as
it
always
does
from
the
cold
barrier
down
to
the
comparatively
warm
the
temperature
was
and
i
was
a
fool
to
take
my
hands
out
of
my
mitts
to
haul
on
the
ropes
to
bring
the
sledges
up
i
started
away
from
the
barrier
edge
with
all
ten
fingers
they
did
not
really
come
back
until
we
were
in
the
tent
for
our
night
meal
and
within
a
few
hours
there
were
two
or
three
large
blisters
up
to
an
inch
long
on
all
of
them
for
many
days
those
blisters
hurt
frightfully
we
were
camped
that
night
about
half
a
mile
in
from
the
barrier
edge
the
temperature
was
we
had
a
baddish
time
being
very
glad
to
get
out
of
our
shivering
bags
next
morning
june
we
began
to
suspect
as
we
knew
only
too
well
later
that
the
only
good
time
of
the
hours
was
breakfast
for
then
with
reasonable
luck
we
need
not
get
into
our
again
for
another
seventeen
hours
illustration
a
panoramic
view
of
ross
island
from
crater
hill
the
horror
of
the
nineteen
days
it
took
us
to
travel
from
cape
evans
to
cape
crozier
would
have
to
be
to
be
appreciated
and
any
one
would
be
a
fool
who
went
again
it
is
not
possible
to
describe
it
the
weeks
which
followed
them
were
comparative
bliss
not
because
later
our
conditions
were
better
they
were
far
worse
because
we
were
callous
i
for
one
had
come
to
that
point
of
suffering
at
which
i
did
not
really
care
if
only
i
could
die
without
much
pain
they
talk
of
the
heroism
of
the
dying
they
little
know
it
would
be
so
easy
to
die
a
dose
of
morphia
a
friendly
crevasse
and
blissful
sleep
the
trouble
is
to
go
on
it
was
the
darkness
that
did
it
i
do
believe
minus
seventy
temperatures
would
be
bad
in
daylight
not
comparatively
bad
when
you
could
see
where
you
were
going
where
you
were
stepping
where
the
sledge
straps
were
the
cooker
the
primus
the
food
could
see
your
footsteps
lately
trodden
deep
into
the
soft
snow
that
you
might
find
your
way
back
to
the
rest
of
your
load
could
see
the
lashings
of
the
food
bags
could
read
a
compass
without
striking
three
or
four
different
boxes
to
find
one
dry
match
could
read
your
watch
to
see
if
the
blissful
moment
of
getting
out
of
your
bag
was
come
without
groping
in
the
snow
all
about
when
it
would
not
take
you
five
minutes
to
lash
up
the
door
of
the
tent
and
five
hours
to
get
started
in
the
morning
but
in
these
days
we
were
never
less
than
four
hours
from
the
moment
when
bill
cried
time
to
get
up
to
the
time
when
we
got
into
our
harness
it
took
two
men
to
get
one
man
into
his
harness
and
was
all
they
could
do
for
the
canvas
was
frozen
and
our
clothes
were
frozen
until
sometimes
not
even
two
men
could
bend
them
into
the
required
shape
the
trouble
is
sweat
and
breath
i
never
knew
before
how
much
of
the
body
waste
comes
out
through
the
pores
of
the
skin
on
the
most
bitter
days
when
we
had
to
camp
before
we
had
done
a
march
in
order
to
nurse
back
our
frozen
feet
it
seemed
that
we
must
be
sweating
and
all
this
sweat
instead
of
passing
away
through
the
porous
wool
of
our
clothing
and
gradually
drying
off
us
froze
and
accumulated
it
passed
just
away
from
our
flesh
and
then
became
ice
we
shook
plenty
of
snow
and
ice
down
from
inside
our
trousers
every
time
we
changed
our
and
we
could
have
shaken
it
from
our
vests
and
from
between
our
vests
and
shirts
but
of
course
we
could
not
strip
to
this
extent
but
when
we
got
into
our
if
we
were
fortunate
we
became
warm
enough
during
the
night
to
thaw
this
ice
part
remained
in
our
clothes
part
passed
into
the
skins
of
our
and
soon
both
were
sheets
of
as
for
our
breath
in
the
daytime
it
did
nothing
worse
than
cover
the
lower
parts
of
our
faces
with
ice
and
solder
our
balaclavas
tightly
to
our
heads
it
was
no
good
trying
to
get
your
balaclava
off
until
you
had
had
the
primus
going
quite
a
long
time
and
then
you
could
throw
your
breath
about
if
you
wished
the
trouble
really
began
in
your
for
it
was
far
too
cold
to
keep
a
hole
open
through
which
to
breathe
so
all
night
long
our
breath
froze
into
the
skins
and
our
respiration
became
quicker
and
quicker
as
the
air
in
our
bags
got
fouler
and
fouler
it
was
never
possible
to
make
a
match
strike
or
burn
inside
our
bags
of
course
we
were
not
iced
up
all
at
once
it
took
several
days
of
this
kind
of
thing
before
we
really
got
into
big
difficulties
on
this
score
it
was
not
until
i
got
out
of
the
tent
one
morning
fully
ready
to
pack
the
sledge
that
i
realized
the
possibilities
ahead
we
had
had
our
breakfast
struggled
into
our
and
squared
up
inside
the
tent
which
was
comparatively
warm
once
outside
i
raised
my
head
to
look
round
and
found
i
could
not
move
it
back
my
clothing
had
frozen
hard
as
i
stood
perhaps
fifteen
seconds
for
four
hours
i
had
to
pull
with
my
head
stuck
up
and
from
that
time
we
all
took
care
to
bend
down
into
a
pulling
position
before
being
frozen
in
by
now
we
had
realized
that
we
must
reverse
the
usual
sledging
routine
and
do
everything
slowly
wearing
when
possible
the
fur
mitts
which
fitted
over
our
woollen
mitts
and
always
stopping
whatever
we
were
doing
directly
we
felt
that
any
part
of
us
was
getting
frozen
until
the
circulation
was
restored
henceforward
it
was
common
for
one
or
other
of
us
to
leave
the
other
two
to
continue
the
camp
work
while
he
stamped
about
in
the
snow
beat
his
arms
or
nursed
some
exposed
part
but
we
could
not
restore
the
circulation
of
our
feet
like
this
the
only
way
then
was
to
camp
and
get
some
hot
water
into
ourselves
before
we
took
our
off
the
difficulty
was
to
know
whether
our
feet
were
frozen
or
not
for
the
only
thing
we
knew
for
certain
was
that
we
had
lost
all
feeling
in
them
wilson
knowledge
as
a
doctor
came
in
here
many
a
time
he
had
to
decide
from
our
descriptions
of
our
feet
whether
to
camp
or
to
go
on
for
another
hour
a
wrong
decision
meant
disaster
for
if
one
of
us
had
been
crippled
the
whole
party
would
have
been
placed
in
great
difficulties
probably
we
should
all
have
died
on
june
the
temperature
was
all
day
and
there
was
sometimes
a
light
breeze
which
was
inclined
to
our
faces
and
hands
owing
to
the
weight
of
our
two
sledges
and
the
bad
surface
our
pace
was
not
more
than
a
slow
and
very
heavy
plod
at
our
lunch
camp
wilson
had
the
heel
and
sole
of
one
foot
and
i
had
two
big
toes
bowers
was
never
worried
by
feet
that
night
was
very
cold
the
temperature
falling
to
and
it
was
at
breakfast
on
june
we
had
not
shipped
the
linings
to
our
in
order
to
keep
them
dry
as
long
as
possible
my
own
fur
bag
was
too
big
for
me
and
throughout
this
journey
was
more
difficult
to
thaw
out
than
the
other
two
on
the
other
hand
it
never
split
as
did
bill
we
were
now
getting
into
that
cold
bay
which
lies
between
the
hut
point
peninsula
and
terror
point
it
was
known
from
old
discovery
days
that
the
barrier
winds
are
deflected
from
this
area
pouring
out
into
mcmurdo
sound
behind
us
and
into
the
ross
sea
at
cape
crozier
in
front
in
consequence
of
the
lack
of
high
winds
the
surface
of
the
snow
is
never
swept
and
hardened
and
polished
as
elsewhere
it
was
now
a
mass
of
the
hardest
and
smallest
snow
crystals
to
pull
through
which
in
cold
temperatures
was
just
like
pulling
through
sand
i
have
spoken
elsewhere
of
barrier
surfaces
and
how
when
the
cold
is
very
great
sledge
runners
can
not
melt
the
crystal
points
but
only
advance
by
rolling
them
over
and
over
upon
one
another
that
was
the
surface
we
met
on
this
journey
and
in
soft
snow
the
effect
is
accentuated
our
feet
were
sinking
deep
at
every
step
and
so
when
we
tried
to
start
on
june
we
found
we
could
not
move
both
sledges
together
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
one
on
at
a
time
and
come
back
for
the
other
this
has
often
been
done
in
daylight
when
the
only
risks
run
are
those
of
blizzards
which
may
spring
up
suddenly
and
obliterate
tracks
now
in
darkness
it
was
more
complicated
from
to
there
was
enough
light
to
see
the
big
holes
made
by
our
feet
and
we
took
on
one
sledge
trudged
back
in
our
tracks
and
brought
on
the
second
bowers
used
to
toggle
and
untoggle
our
harnesses
when
we
changed
sledges
of
course
in
this
relay
work
we
covered
three
miles
in
distance
for
every
one
mile
forward
and
even
the
single
sledges
were
very
hard
pulling
when
we
lunched
the
temperature
was
after
lunch
the
little
light
had
gone
and
we
carried
a
naked
lighted
candle
back
with
us
when
we
went
to
find
our
second
sledge
it
was
the
weirdest
kind
of
procession
three
frozen
men
and
a
little
pool
of
light
generally
we
steered
by
jupiter
and
i
never
see
him
now
without
recalling
his
friendship
in
those
days
we
were
very
silent
it
was
not
very
easy
to
talk
but
sledging
is
always
a
silent
business
i
remember
a
long
discussion
which
began
just
now
about
cold
snaps
was
this
the
normal
condition
of
the
barrier
or
was
it
a
cold
snap
what
constituted
a
cold
snap
the
discussion
lasted
about
a
week
do
things
slowly
always
slowly
that
was
the
burden
of
leadership
and
every
now
and
then
the
question
shall
we
go
on
and
the
answer
yes
i
think
we
are
all
right
as
long
as
our
appetites
are
good
said
bill
always
patient
unruffled
he
was
the
only
man
on
earth
as
i
believe
who
could
have
led
this
journey
that
day
we
made
miles
and
travelled
miles
to
do
it
the
temperature
was
when
we
camped
and
we
were
already
pretty
badly
iced
up
that
was
the
last
night
i
lay
i
had
written
slept
in
my
big
reindeer
bag
without
the
lining
of
which
we
each
carried
for
me
it
was
a
very
bad
night
a
succession
of
shivering
fits
which
i
was
quite
unable
to
stop
and
which
took
possession
of
my
body
for
many
minutes
at
a
time
until
i
thought
my
back
would
break
such
was
the
strain
placed
upon
it
they
talk
of
chattering
teeth
but
when
your
body
chatters
you
may
call
yourself
cold
i
can
only
compare
the
strain
to
that
which
i
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
see
in
a
case
of
one
of
my
big
toes
was
but
i
do
not
know
for
how
long
wilson
was
fairly
comfortable
in
his
smaller
bag
and
bowers
was
snoring
loudly
the
minimum
temperature
that
night
as
taken
under
the
sledge
was
and
as
taken
on
the
sledge
was
that
is
a
hundred
and
seven
degrees
of
frost
we
did
the
same
relay
work
on
july
but
found
the
pulling
still
harder
and
it
was
all
that
we
could
do
to
move
the
one
sledge
forward
from
now
onwards
wilson
and
i
but
not
to
the
same
extent
bowers
experienced
a
curious
optical
delusion
when
returning
in
our
tracks
for
the
second
sledge
i
have
said
that
we
found
our
way
back
by
the
light
of
a
candle
and
we
found
it
necessary
to
go
back
in
our
same
footprints
these
holes
became
to
our
tired
brains
not
depressions
but
elevations
hummocks
over
which
we
stepped
raising
our
feet
painfully
and
draggingly
and
then
we
remembered
and
said
what
fools
we
were
and
for
a
while
we
compelled
ourselves
to
walk
through
these
phantom
hills
but
it
was
no
lasting
good
and
as
the
days
passed
we
realized
that
we
must
suffer
this
absurdity
for
we
could
not
do
anything
else
but
of
course
it
took
it
out
of
us
during
these
days
the
blisters
on
my
fingers
were
very
painful
long
before
my
hands
were
or
indeed
anything
but
cold
which
was
of
course
a
normal
thing
the
matter
inside
these
big
blisters
which
rose
all
down
my
fingers
with
only
a
skin
between
them
was
frozen
into
ice
to
handle
the
cooking
gear
or
the
food
bags
was
agony
to
start
the
primus
was
worse
and
when
one
day
i
was
able
to
prick
six
or
seven
of
the
blisters
after
supper
and
let
the
liquid
matter
out
the
relief
was
very
great
every
night
after
that
i
treated
such
others
as
were
ready
in
the
same
way
until
they
gradually
disappeared
sometimes
it
was
difficult
not
to
howl
i
want
to
howl
many
times
every
hour
of
these
days
and
nights
but
i
invented
a
formula
instead
which
i
repeated
to
myself
continually
especially
i
remember
it
came
in
useful
when
at
the
end
of
the
march
with
my
feet
my
heart
beating
slowly
my
vitality
at
its
lowest
ebb
my
body
solid
with
cold
i
used
to
seize
the
shovel
and
go
on
digging
snow
on
to
the
tent
skirting
while
the
cook
inside
was
trying
to
light
the
primus
you
got
it
in
the
neck
stick
it
stick
it
got
it
in
the
neck
was
the
refrain
and
i
wanted
every
little
bit
of
encouragement
it
would
give
me
then
i
would
find
myself
repeating
stick
it
stick
it
stick
it
stick
it
and
then
you
got
it
in
the
neck
one
of
the
joys
of
summer
sledging
is
that
you
can
let
your
mind
wander
thousands
of
miles
away
for
weeks
and
weeks
oates
used
to
provision
his
little
yacht
there
was
a
pickled
herring
he
was
going
to
have
i
invented
the
compactest
little
revolving
bookcase
which
was
going
to
hold
not
books
but
pemmican
and
chocolate
and
biscuit
and
cocoa
and
sugar
and
have
a
cooker
on
the
top
and
was
going
to
stand
always
ready
to
quench
my
hunger
when
i
got
home
and
we
visited
restaurants
and
theatres
and
grouse
moors
and
we
thought
of
a
pretty
girl
or
girls
and
but
now
that
was
all
impossible
our
conditions
forced
themselves
upon
us
without
pause
it
was
not
possible
to
think
of
anything
else
we
got
no
respite
i
found
it
best
to
refuse
to
let
myself
think
of
the
past
or
the
future
to
live
only
for
the
job
of
the
moment
and
to
compel
myself
to
think
only
how
to
do
it
most
efficiently
once
you
let
yourself
imagine
this
day
also
july
we
were
harassed
by
a
nasty
little
wind
which
blew
in
our
faces
the
temperature
was
and
in
such
temperatures
the
effect
of
even
the
lightest
airs
is
blighting
and
immediately
freezes
any
exposed
part
but
we
all
fitted
the
bits
of
lined
with
fur
which
we
had
made
in
the
hut
across
our
balaclavas
in
front
of
our
noses
and
these
were
of
the
greatest
comfort
they
formed
other
places
upon
which
our
breath
could
freeze
and
the
lower
parts
of
our
faces
were
soon
covered
with
solid
sheets
of
ice
which
was
in
itself
an
additional
protection
this
was
a
normal
and
not
uncomfortable
condition
during
the
journey
the
hair
on
our
faces
kept
the
ice
away
from
the
skin
and
for
myself
i
would
rather
have
the
ice
than
be
without
it
until
i
want
to
get
my
balaclava
off
to
drink
my
hoosh
we
only
made
miles
and
it
took
hours
it
blew
force
that
night
with
a
temperature
of
and
there
was
some
drift
this
was
pretty
bad
but
luckily
the
wind
dropped
to
a
light
breeze
by
the
time
we
were
ready
to
start
the
next
morning
july
the
temperature
was
then
and
continued
so
all
day
falling
lower
in
the
evening
at
we
watched
a
bank
of
fog
form
over
the
peninsula
to
our
left
and
noticed
at
the
same
time
that
our
frozen
mitts
thawed
out
on
our
hands
and
the
outlines
of
the
land
as
shown
by
the
stars
became
obscured
we
made
miles
with
the
usual
relaying
and
camped
at
with
the
temperature
it
really
was
a
terrible
march
and
parts
of
both
my
feet
were
frozen
at
lunch
after
supper
i
pricked
six
or
seven
of
the
worst
blisters
and
the
relief
was
considerable
i
have
met
with
amusement
people
who
say
oh
we
had
minus
fifty
temperatures
in
canada
they
did
worry
or
i
been
down
to
minus
sixty
something
in
siberia
and
then
you
find
that
they
had
nice
dry
clothing
a
nice
night
sleep
in
a
nice
aired
bed
and
had
just
walked
out
after
lunch
for
a
few
minutes
from
a
nice
warm
hut
or
an
overheated
train
and
they
look
back
upon
it
as
an
experience
to
be
remembered
well
of
course
as
an
experience
of
cold
this
can
only
be
compared
to
eating
a
vanilla
ice
with
hot
chocolate
cream
after
an
excellent
dinner
at
claridge
but
in
our
present
state
we
began
to
look
upon
minus
fifties
as
a
luxury
which
we
did
not
often
get
that
evening
for
the
first
time
we
discarded
our
naked
candle
in
favour
of
the
rising
moon
we
had
started
before
the
moon
on
purpose
but
as
we
shall
see
she
gave
us
little
light
however
we
owed
our
escape
from
a
very
sticky
death
to
her
on
one
occasion
it
was
a
little
later
on
when
we
were
among
crevasses
with
terror
above
us
but
invisible
somewhere
on
our
left
and
the
barrier
pressure
on
our
right
we
were
quite
lost
in
the
darkness
and
only
knew
that
we
were
running
downhill
the
sledge
almost
catching
our
heels
there
had
been
no
light
all
day
clouds
obscured
the
moon
we
had
not
seen
her
since
yesterday
and
quite
suddenly
a
little
patch
of
clear
sky
drifted
as
it
were
over
her
face
and
she
showed
us
three
paces
ahead
a
great
crevasse
with
just
a
shining
icy
lid
not
much
thicker
than
glass
we
should
all
have
walked
into
it
and
the
sledge
would
certainly
have
followed
us
down
after
that
i
felt
we
had
a
chance
of
pulling
through
god
could
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
have
saved
us
just
to
prolong
our
agony
but
at
present
we
need
not
worry
about
crevasses
for
we
had
not
reached
the
long
stretch
where
the
moving
barrier
with
the
weight
of
many
hundred
miles
of
ice
behind
it
comes
butting
up
against
the
slopes
of
mount
terror
itself
some
eleven
thousand
feet
high
now
we
were
still
plunging
in
the
mass
of
soft
sandy
snow
which
lies
in
the
windless
area
it
seemed
to
have
no
bottom
at
all
and
since
the
snow
was
much
the
same
temperature
as
the
air
our
feet
as
well
as
our
bodies
got
colder
and
colder
the
longer
we
marched
in
ordinary
sledging
you
begin
to
warm
up
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
pulling
here
it
was
just
the
reverse
even
now
i
find
myself
unconsciously
kicking
the
toes
of
my
right
foot
against
the
heel
of
my
left
a
habit
i
picked
up
on
this
journey
by
doing
it
every
time
we
halted
well
no
not
always
for
there
was
one
halt
when
we
just
lay
on
our
backs
and
gazed
up
into
the
sky
where
so
the
others
said
there
was
blazing
the
most
wonderful
aurora
they
had
ever
seen
i
did
not
see
it
being
so
and
unable
to
wear
spectacles
owing
to
the
cold
the
aurora
was
always
before
us
as
we
travelled
east
more
beautiful
than
any
seen
by
previous
expeditions
wintering
in
mcmurdo
sound
where
erebus
must
have
hidden
the
most
brilliant
displays
now
most
of
the
sky
was
covered
with
swinging
swaying
curtains
which
met
in
a
great
whirl
overhead
lemon
yellow
green
and
orange
the
minimum
this
night
was
and
during
july
it
ranged
between
and
we
got
forward
only
miles
and
by
this
time
i
had
silently
made
up
my
mind
that
we
had
not
the
ghost
of
a
chance
of
reaching
the
penguins
i
am
sure
that
bill
was
having
a
very
bad
time
these
nights
though
it
was
an
impression
rather
than
anything
else
for
he
never
said
so
we
knew
we
did
sleep
for
we
heard
one
another
snore
and
also
we
used
to
have
dreams
and
nightmares
but
we
had
little
consciousness
of
it
and
we
were
now
beginning
to
drop
off
when
we
halted
on
the
march
our
were
getting
really
bad
by
now
and
already
it
took
a
long
time
to
thaw
a
way
down
into
them
at
night
bill
spread
his
in
the
middle
bowers
was
on
his
right
and
i
was
on
his
left
always
he
insisted
that
i
should
start
getting
my
legs
into
mine
before
started
we
were
rapidly
cooling
down
after
our
hot
supper
and
this
was
very
unselfish
of
him
then
came
seven
shivering
hours
and
first
thing
on
getting
out
of
our
in
the
morning
we
stuffed
our
personal
gear
into
the
mouth
of
the
bag
before
it
could
freeze
this
made
a
plug
which
when
removed
formed
a
frozen
hole
for
us
to
push
into
as
a
start
in
the
evening
we
got
into
some
strange
knots
when
trying
to
persuade
our
limbs
into
our
bags
and
suffered
terribly
from
cramp
in
consequence
we
would
wait
and
rub
but
directly
we
tried
to
move
again
down
it
would
come
and
grip
our
legs
in
a
vice
we
also
especially
bowers
suffered
agony
from
cramp
in
the
stomach
we
let
the
primus
burn
on
after
supper
now
for
a
time
it
was
the
only
thing
which
kept
us
going
and
when
one
who
was
holding
the
primus
was
seized
with
cramp
we
hastily
took
the
lamp
from
him
until
the
spasm
was
over
it
was
horrible
to
see
birdie
stomach
cramp
sometimes
he
certainly
got
it
much
worse
than
bill
or
i
suffered
a
lot
from
heartburn
especially
in
my
bag
at
nights
we
were
eating
a
great
proportion
of
fat
and
this
was
probably
the
cause
stupidly
i
said
nothing
about
it
for
a
long
time
later
when
bill
found
out
he
soon
made
it
better
with
the
medical
case
birdie
always
lit
the
candle
in
the
morning
so
called
and
this
was
an
heroic
business
moisture
collected
on
our
matches
if
you
looked
at
them
partly
i
suppose
it
was
bringing
them
from
outside
into
a
comparatively
warm
tent
partly
from
putting
boxes
into
pockets
in
our
clothing
sometimes
it
was
necessary
to
try
four
or
five
boxes
before
a
match
struck
the
temperature
of
the
boxes
and
matches
was
about
a
hundred
degrees
of
frost
and
the
smallest
touch
of
the
metal
on
naked
flesh
caused
a
if
you
wore
mitts
you
could
scarcely
feel
anything
especially
since
the
tips
of
our
fingers
were
already
very
callous
to
get
the
first
light
going
in
the
morning
was
a
beastly
cold
business
made
worse
by
having
to
make
sure
that
it
was
at
last
time
to
get
up
bill
insisted
that
we
must
lie
in
our
bags
seven
hours
every
night
in
civilization
men
are
taken
at
their
own
valuation
because
there
are
so
many
ways
of
concealment
and
there
is
so
little
time
perhaps
even
so
little
understanding
not
so
down
south
these
two
men
went
through
the
winter
journey
and
lived
later
they
went
through
the
polar
journey
and
died
they
were
gold
pure
shining
unalloyed
words
can
not
express
how
good
their
companionship
was
through
all
these
days
and
those
which
were
to
follow
the
worst
i
suppose
in
their
dark
severity
that
men
have
ever
come
through
alive
no
single
hasty
or
angry
word
passed
their
lips
when
later
we
were
sure
so
far
as
we
can
be
sure
of
anything
that
we
must
die
they
were
cheerful
and
so
far
as
i
can
judge
their
songs
and
cheery
words
were
quite
unforced
nor
were
they
ever
flurried
though
always
as
quick
as
the
conditions
would
allow
in
moments
of
emergency
it
is
hard
that
often
such
men
must
go
first
when
others
far
less
worthy
remain
illustration
camping
after
dark
wilson
del
there
are
those
who
write
of
polar
expeditions
as
though
the
whole
thing
was
as
easy
as
possible
they
are
trusting
i
suspect
in
a
public
who
will
say
what
a
fine
fellow
this
is
we
know
what
horrors
he
has
endured
yet
see
how
little
he
makes
of
all
his
difficulties
and
hardships
others
have
gone
to
the
opposite
extreme
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
use
in
trying
to
make
a
temperature
appear
formidable
to
an
uninitiated
reader
by
calling
it
fifty
degrees
of
frost
i
want
to
do
neither
of
these
things
i
am
not
going
to
pretend
that
this
was
anything
but
a
ghastly
journey
made
bearable
and
even
pleasant
to
look
back
upon
by
the
qualities
of
my
two
companions
who
have
gone
at
the
same
time
i
have
no
wish
to
make
it
appear
more
horrible
than
it
actually
was
the
reader
need
not
fear
that
i
am
trying
to
exaggerate
during
the
night
of
july
the
temperature
dropped
to
but
in
the
morning
we
wakened
we
really
did
wake
that
morning
to
great
relief
the
temperature
was
only
with
the
wind
blowing
some
miles
an
hour
with
steadily
falling
snow
it
only
lasted
a
few
hours
and
we
knew
it
must
be
blowing
a
howling
blizzard
outside
the
windless
area
in
which
we
lay
but
it
gave
us
time
to
sleep
and
rest
and
get
thoroughly
thawed
and
wet
and
warm
inside
our
to
me
at
any
rate
this
modified
blizzard
was
a
great
relief
though
we
all
knew
that
our
gear
would
be
worse
than
ever
when
the
cold
came
back
it
was
quite
impossible
to
march
during
the
course
of
the
day
the
temperature
dropped
to
during
the
following
night
to
the
soft
new
snow
which
had
fallen
made
the
surface
the
next
day
july
almost
impossible
we
relayed
as
usual
and
managed
to
do
eight
pulling
but
we
got
forward
only
miles
the
temperature
ranged
between
and
and
there
was
at
one
time
a
considerable
breeze
the
effect
of
which
was
paralysing
there
was
the
great
circle
of
a
halo
round
the
moon
with
a
vertical
shaft
and
mock
moons
we
hoped
that
we
were
rising
on
to
the
long
snow
cape
which
marks
the
beginning
of
mount
terror
that
night
the
temperature
was
at
breakfast
at
noon
nearly
the
day
lives
in
my
memory
as
that
on
which
i
found
out
that
records
are
not
worth
making
the
thermometer
as
swung
by
bowers
after
lunch
at
registered
which
is
degrees
of
frost
and
is
i
suppose
as
cold
as
any
one
will
want
to
endure
in
darkness
and
gear
and
clothes
the
lowest
temperature
recorded
by
a
discovery
spring
journey
party
was
and
in
those
days
fourteen
days
was
a
long
time
for
a
spring
party
to
be
away
sledging
and
they
were
in
daylight
this
was
our
tenth
day
out
and
we
hoped
to
be
away
for
six
weeks
luckily
we
were
spared
wind
our
naked
candle
burnt
steadily
as
we
trudged
back
in
our
tracks
to
fetch
our
other
sledge
but
if
we
touched
metal
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
with
naked
fingers
we
were
to
fasten
the
strap
buckles
over
the
loaded
sledge
was
difficult
to
handle
the
cooker
or
mugs
or
spoons
the
primus
or
oil
can
was
worse
how
bowers
managed
with
the
meteorological
instruments
i
do
not
know
but
the
meteorological
log
is
perfectly
kept
yet
as
soon
as
you
breathed
near
the
paper
it
was
covered
with
a
film
of
ice
through
which
the
pencil
would
not
bite
to
handle
rope
was
always
cold
and
in
these
very
low
temperatures
dreadfully
cold
work
the
toggling
up
of
our
harnesses
to
the
sledge
we
were
about
to
pull
the
untoggling
at
the
end
of
the
stage
the
lashing
up
of
our
in
the
morning
the
fastening
of
the
cooker
to
the
top
of
the
instrument
box
were
bad
but
not
nearly
so
bad
as
the
smaller
lashings
which
were
now
strings
of
ice
one
of
the
worst
was
round
the
weekly
food
bag
and
those
round
the
pemmican
tea
and
butter
bags
inside
were
thinner
still
but
the
real
devil
was
the
lashing
of
the
tent
door
it
was
like
wire
and
yet
had
to
be
tied
tight
if
you
had
to
get
out
of
the
tent
during
the
seven
hours
spent
in
our
you
must
tie
a
string
as
stiff
as
a
poker
and
your
way
into
a
bag
already
as
hard
as
a
board
our
paraffin
was
supplied
at
a
flash
point
suitable
to
low
temperatures
and
was
only
a
little
milky
it
was
very
difficult
to
splinter
bits
off
the
butter
the
temperature
that
night
was
and
i
will
not
pretend
that
it
did
not
convince
me
that
dante
was
right
when
he
placed
the
circles
of
ice
below
the
circles
of
fire
still
we
slept
sometimes
and
always
we
lay
for
seven
hours
again
and
again
bill
asked
us
how
about
going
back
and
always
we
said
no
yet
there
was
nothing
i
should
have
liked
better
i
was
quite
sure
that
to
dream
of
cape
crozier
was
the
wildest
lunacy
that
day
we
had
advanced
miles
by
the
utmost
labour
and
the
usual
relay
work
this
was
quite
a
good
march
and
cape
crozier
is
miles
from
cape
evans
more
than
once
in
my
short
life
i
have
been
struck
by
the
value
of
the
man
who
is
blind
to
what
appears
to
be
a
certainty
he
achieves
the
impossible
we
never
spoke
our
thoughts
we
discussed
the
age
of
stone
which
was
to
come
when
we
built
our
cosy
warm
rock
hut
on
the
slopes
of
mount
terror
and
ran
our
stove
with
penguin
blubber
and
pickled
little
emperors
in
warmth
and
dryness
we
were
quite
intelligent
people
and
we
must
all
have
known
that
we
were
not
going
to
see
the
penguins
and
that
it
was
folly
to
go
forward
and
yet
with
quiet
perseverance
in
perfect
friendship
almost
with
gentleness
those
two
men
led
on
i
just
did
what
i
was
told
it
is
desirable
that
the
body
should
work
feed
and
sleep
at
regular
hours
and
this
is
too
often
forgotten
when
sledging
but
just
now
we
found
we
were
unable
to
fit
hours
marching
and
hours
in
our
into
a
day
the
routine
camp
work
took
more
than
hours
such
were
the
conditions
we
therefore
ceased
to
observe
the
quite
imaginary
difference
between
night
and
day
and
it
was
noon
on
friday
july
before
we
got
away
the
temperature
was
and
there
was
a
thick
white
fog
generally
we
had
but
the
vaguest
idea
where
we
were
and
we
camped
at
after
managing
miles
for
the
day
but
what
a
relief
instead
of
labouring
away
our
hearts
were
beating
more
naturally
it
was
easier
to
camp
we
had
some
feeling
in
our
hands
and
our
feet
had
not
gone
to
sleep
birdie
swung
the
thermometer
and
found
it
only
now
if
we
tell
people
that
to
get
only
degrees
of
frost
can
be
an
enormous
relief
they
simply
wo
believe
us
i
remember
saying
perhaps
you
wo
but
it
was
all
the
same
and
i
wrote
that
night
there
is
something
after
all
rather
good
in
doing
something
never
done
before
things
were
looking
up
you
see
our
hearts
were
doing
very
gallant
work
towards
the
end
of
the
march
they
were
getting
beaten
and
were
finding
it
difficult
to
pump
the
blood
out
to
our
extremities
there
were
few
days
that
wilson
and
i
did
not
get
some
part
of
our
feet
as
we
camped
i
suspect
our
hearts
were
beating
comparatively
slowly
and
weakly
nothing
could
be
done
until
a
hot
drink
was
ready
tea
for
lunch
hot
water
for
supper
directly
we
started
to
drink
then
the
effect
was
wonderful
it
was
said
wilson
like
putting
a
bottle
against
your
heart
the
beats
became
very
rapid
and
strong
and
you
felt
the
warmth
travelling
outwards
and
downwards
then
you
got
your
off
puttees
cut
in
half
and
wound
round
the
bottom
of
the
trousers
finnesko
saennegrass
hair
socks
and
two
pairs
of
woollen
socks
then
you
nursed
back
your
feet
and
tried
to
believe
you
were
glad
a
does
not
hurt
until
it
begins
to
thaw
later
came
the
blisters
and
then
the
chunks
of
dead
skin
bill
was
anxious
it
seems
that
scott
had
twice
gone
for
a
walk
with
him
during
the
winter
and
tried
to
persuade
him
not
to
go
and
only
finally
consented
on
condition
that
bill
brought
us
all
back
unharmed
we
were
southern
journey
men
bill
had
a
tremendous
respect
for
scott
and
later
when
we
were
about
to
make
an
effort
to
get
back
home
over
the
barrier
and
our
case
was
very
desperate
he
was
most
anxious
to
leave
no
gear
behind
at
cape
crozier
even
the
scientific
gear
which
could
be
of
no
use
to
us
and
of
which
we
had
plenty
more
at
the
hut
scott
will
never
forgive
me
if
i
leave
gear
behind
he
said
it
is
a
good
sledging
principle
and
the
party
which
does
not
follow
it
or
which
leaves
some
of
its
load
to
be
fetched
in
later
is
seldom
a
good
one
but
it
is
a
principle
which
can
be
carried
to
excess
and
now
bill
was
feeling
terribly
responsible
for
both
of
us
he
kept
on
saying
that
he
was
sorry
but
he
had
never
dreamed
it
was
going
to
be
as
bad
as
this
he
felt
that
having
asked
us
to
come
he
was
in
some
way
chargeable
with
our
troubles
when
leaders
have
this
kind
of
feeling
about
their
men
they
get
much
better
results
if
the
men
are
good
if
men
are
bad
or
even
moderate
they
will
try
and
take
advantage
of
what
they
consider
to
be
softness
the
temperature
on
the
night
of
july
was
on
july
we
found
the
first
sign
that
we
might
be
coming
to
an
end
of
this
soft
powdered
arrowrooty
snow
it
was
frightfully
hard
pulling
but
every
now
and
then
our
finnesko
pierced
a
thin
crust
before
they
sank
right
in
this
meant
a
little
wind
and
every
now
and
then
our
feet
came
down
on
a
hard
slippery
patch
under
the
soft
snow
we
were
surrounded
by
fog
which
walked
along
with
us
and
far
above
us
the
moon
was
shining
on
its
roof
steering
was
as
difficult
as
the
pulling
and
four
hours
of
the
hardest
work
only
produced
miles
in
the
morning
and
three
more
hours
mile
in
the
afternoon
and
the
temperature
was
with
a
breeze
horrible
in
the
early
morning
of
the
next
day
snow
began
to
fall
and
the
fog
was
dense
when
we
got
up
we
could
see
nothing
at
all
anywhere
after
the
usual
four
hours
to
get
going
in
the
morning
we
settled
that
it
was
impossible
to
relay
for
we
should
never
be
able
to
track
ourselves
back
to
the
second
sledge
it
was
with
very
great
relief
that
we
found
we
could
move
both
sledges
together
and
i
think
this
was
mainly
due
to
the
temperature
which
had
risen
to
this
was
our
fourth
day
of
fog
in
addition
to
the
normal
darkness
and
we
knew
we
must
be
approaching
the
land
it
would
be
terror
point
and
the
fog
is
probably
caused
by
the
moist
warm
air
coming
up
from
the
sea
through
the
pressure
cracks
and
crevasses
for
it
is
supposed
that
the
barrier
here
is
afloat
i
wish
i
could
take
you
on
to
the
great
ice
barrier
some
calm
evening
when
the
sun
is
just
dipping
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
show
you
the
autumn
tints
on
ross
island
a
last
look
round
before
turning
in
a
good
day
march
behind
enough
fine
fat
pemmican
inside
you
to
make
you
happy
the
homely
smell
of
tobacco
from
the
tent
a
pleasant
sense
of
soft
fur
and
the
deep
sleep
to
come
and
all
the
softest
colours
god
has
made
are
in
the
snow
on
erebus
to
the
west
where
the
wind
can
scarcely
move
his
cloud
of
smoke
and
on
terror
to
the
east
not
so
high
and
more
regular
in
form
how
peaceful
and
dignified
it
all
is
that
was
what
you
might
have
seen
four
months
ago
had
you
been
out
on
the
barrier
plain
low
down
on
the
extreme
right
or
east
of
the
land
there
was
a
black
smudge
of
rock
peeping
out
from
great
that
was
the
knoll
and
close
under
it
were
the
cliffs
of
cape
crozier
the
knoll
looking
quite
low
and
the
cliffs
invisible
although
they
are
eight
hundred
feet
high
a
sheer
precipice
falling
to
the
sea
it
is
at
cape
crozier
that
the
barrier
edge
which
runs
for
four
hundred
miles
as
an
up
to
feet
high
meets
the
land
the
barrier
is
moving
against
this
land
at
a
rate
which
is
sometimes
not
much
less
than
a
mile
in
a
year
perhaps
you
can
imagine
the
chaos
which
it
piles
up
there
are
pressure
ridges
compared
to
which
the
waves
of
the
sea
are
like
a
ploughed
field
these
are
worst
at
cape
crozier
itself
but
they
extend
all
along
the
southern
slopes
of
mount
terror
running
parallel
with
the
land
and
the
disturbance
which
cape
crozier
makes
is
apparent
at
corner
camp
some
forty
miles
back
on
the
barrier
in
the
crevasses
we
used
to
find
and
the
occasional
ridges
we
had
to
cross
in
the
discovery
days
the
pressure
just
where
it
hit
cape
crozier
formed
a
small
bay
and
on
the
frozen
in
this
bay
the
men
of
the
discovery
found
the
only
emperor
penguin
rookery
which
had
ever
been
seen
the
ice
here
was
not
blown
out
by
the
blizzards
which
cleared
the
ross
sea
and
open
water
or
open
leads
were
never
far
away
this
gave
the
emperors
a
place
to
lay
their
eggs
and
an
opportunity
to
find
their
food
we
had
therefore
to
find
our
way
along
the
pressure
to
the
knoll
and
thence
penetrate
the
pressure
to
the
emperors
bay
and
we
had
to
do
it
in
the
dark
terror
point
which
we
were
approaching
in
the
fog
is
a
short
twenty
miles
from
the
knoll
and
ends
in
a
long
running
out
into
the
barrier
the
way
had
been
travelled
a
good
many
times
in
discovery
days
and
in
daylight
and
wilson
knew
there
was
a
narrow
path
free
from
crevasses
which
skirted
along
between
the
mountain
and
the
pressure
ridges
running
parallel
to
it
but
it
is
one
thing
to
walk
along
a
corridor
by
day
and
quite
another
to
try
to
do
so
at
night
especially
when
there
are
no
walls
by
which
you
can
correct
your
course
only
crevasses
anyway
terror
point
must
be
somewhere
close
to
us
now
and
vaguely
in
front
of
us
was
that
strip
of
snow
neither
barrier
nor
mountain
which
was
our
only
way
forward
we
began
to
realize
now
that
our
eyes
were
more
or
less
out
of
action
how
much
we
could
do
with
our
feet
and
ears
the
effect
of
walking
in
finnesko
is
much
the
same
as
walking
in
gloves
and
you
get
a
sense
of
touch
which
nothing
else
except
bare
feet
could
give
you
thus
we
could
feel
every
small
variation
in
surface
every
crust
through
which
our
feet
broke
every
hardened
patch
below
the
soft
snow
and
soon
we
began
to
rely
more
and
more
upon
the
sound
of
our
footsteps
to
tell
us
whether
we
were
on
crevasses
or
solid
ground
from
now
onwards
we
were
working
among
crevasses
fairly
constantly
i
loathe
them
in
full
daylight
when
much
can
be
done
to
avoid
them
and
when
if
you
fall
into
them
you
can
at
any
rate
see
where
the
sides
are
which
way
they
run
and
how
best
to
scramble
out
when
your
companions
can
see
how
to
stop
the
sledge
to
which
you
are
all
attached
by
your
harness
how
most
safely
to
hold
the
sledge
when
stopped
how
if
you
are
dangling
fifteen
feet
down
in
a
chasm
to
work
above
you
to
get
you
up
to
the
surface
again
and
then
our
clothes
were
generally
something
like
clothes
even
under
the
ideal
conditions
of
good
light
warmth
and
no
wind
crevasses
are
beastly
whether
you
are
pulling
over
a
level
and
uniform
snow
surface
never
knowing
what
moment
will
find
you
dropping
into
some
bottomless
pit
or
whether
you
are
rushing
for
the
alpine
rope
and
the
sledge
to
help
some
companion
who
has
disappeared
i
dream
sometimes
now
of
bad
days
we
had
on
the
beardmore
and
elsewhere
when
men
were
dropping
through
to
be
caught
up
and
hang
at
the
full
length
of
the
harnesses
and
toggles
many
times
in
an
hour
on
the
same
sledge
as
myself
on
the
beardmore
one
man
went
down
once
head
first
and
another
eight
times
to
the
length
of
his
harness
in
minutes
and
always
you
wondered
whether
your
harness
was
going
to
hold
when
the
jerk
came
but
those
days
were
a
sunday
school
treat
compared
to
our
days
of
buff
with
the
emperor
penguins
among
the
crevasses
of
cape
crozier
our
troubles
were
greatly
increased
by
the
state
of
our
clothes
if
we
had
been
dressed
in
lead
we
should
have
been
able
to
move
our
arms
and
necks
and
heads
more
easily
than
we
could
now
if
the
same
amount
of
icing
had
extended
to
our
legs
i
believe
we
should
still
be
there
standing
unable
to
move
but
happily
the
forks
of
our
trousers
still
remained
movable
to
get
into
our
canvas
harnesses
was
the
most
absurd
business
quite
in
the
early
days
of
our
journey
we
met
with
this
difficulty
and
somewhat
foolishly
decided
not
to
take
off
our
harness
for
lunch
the
harnesses
thawed
in
the
tent
and
froze
back
as
hard
as
boards
likewise
our
clothing
was
hard
as
boards
and
stuck
out
from
our
bodies
in
every
imaginable
fold
and
angle
to
fit
one
board
over
the
other
required
the
united
efforts
of
the
wearer
and
his
two
companions
and
the
process
had
to
be
repeated
for
each
one
of
us
twice
a
day
goodness
knows
how
long
it
took
but
it
can
not
have
been
less
than
five
minutes
thumping
at
each
man
as
we
approached
terror
point
in
the
fog
we
sensed
that
we
had
risen
and
fallen
over
several
rises
every
now
and
then
we
felt
hard
slippery
snow
under
our
feet
every
now
and
then
our
feet
went
through
crusts
in
the
surface
and
then
quite
suddenly
vague
indefinable
monstrous
there
loomed
a
something
ahead
i
remember
having
a
feeling
as
of
ghosts
about
as
we
untoggled
our
harnesses
from
the
sledge
tied
them
together
and
thus
roped
walked
upwards
on
that
ice
the
moon
was
showing
a
ghastly
ragged
mountainous
edge
above
us
in
the
fog
and
as
we
rose
we
found
that
we
were
on
a
pressure
ridge
we
stopped
looked
at
one
another
and
then
right
under
our
feet
more
bangs
and
creaks
and
groans
for
that
ice
was
moving
and
splitting
like
glass
the
cracks
went
off
all
round
us
and
some
of
them
ran
along
for
hundreds
of
yards
afterwards
we
got
used
to
it
but
at
first
the
effect
was
very
jumpy
from
first
to
last
during
this
journey
we
had
plenty
of
variety
and
none
of
that
monotony
which
is
inevitable
in
sledging
over
long
distances
of
barrier
in
summer
only
the
long
shivering
fits
following
close
one
after
the
other
all
the
time
we
lay
in
our
dreadful
hour
after
hour
and
night
after
night
in
those
temperatures
they
were
as
monotonous
as
could
be
later
we
got
even
as
we
lay
in
our
things
are
getting
pretty
bad
when
you
get
in
your
bag
there
was
only
a
glow
where
the
moon
was
we
stood
in
a
moonlit
fog
and
this
was
sufficient
to
show
the
edge
of
another
ridge
ahead
and
yet
another
on
our
left
we
were
utterly
bewildered
the
deep
booming
of
the
ice
continued
and
it
may
be
that
the
tide
has
something
to
do
with
this
though
we
were
many
miles
from
the
ordinary
coastal
ice
we
went
back
toggled
up
to
our
sledges
again
and
pulled
in
what
we
thought
was
the
right
direction
always
with
that
feeling
that
the
earth
may
open
underneath
your
feet
which
you
have
in
crevassed
areas
but
all
we
found
were
more
mounds
and
banks
of
snow
and
ice
into
which
we
almost
ran
before
we
saw
them
we
were
clearly
lost
it
was
near
midnight
and
i
wrote
it
may
be
the
pressure
ridges
or
it
may
be
terror
it
is
impossible
to
say
and
i
should
think
it
is
impossible
to
move
till
it
clears
we
were
steering
when
we
got
here
and
returned
till
we
seemed
to
be
in
a
hollow
and
camped
the
temperature
had
been
rising
from
at
and
it
was
now
snow
was
falling
and
nothing
whatever
could
be
seen
from
under
the
tent
came
noises
as
though
some
giant
was
banging
a
big
empty
tank
all
the
signs
were
for
a
blizzard
and
indeed
we
had
not
long
finished
our
supper
and
were
thawing
our
way
little
by
little
into
our
bags
when
the
wind
came
away
from
the
south
before
it
started
we
got
a
glimpse
of
black
rock
and
knew
we
must
be
in
the
pressure
ridges
where
they
nearly
join
mount
terror
it
is
with
great
surprise
that
in
looking
up
the
records
i
find
that
blizzard
lasted
three
days
the
temperature
and
wind
both
rising
till
it
was
and
blowing
force
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
july
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
july
it
was
blowing
storm
force
the
temperature
had
thus
risen
over
eighty
degrees
it
was
not
an
uncomfortable
time
wet
and
warm
the
risen
temperature
allowed
all
our
ice
to
turn
to
water
and
we
lay
steaming
and
beautifully
liquid
and
wondered
sometimes
what
we
should
be
like
when
our
gear
froze
up
once
more
but
we
did
not
do
much
wondering
i
suspect
we
slept
from
that
point
of
view
these
blizzards
were
a
perfect
godsend
we
also
revised
our
food
rations
from
the
moment
we
started
to
prepare
for
this
journey
we
were
asked
by
scott
to
try
certain
experiments
in
view
of
the
plateau
stage
of
the
polar
journey
the
following
summer
it
was
supposed
that
the
plateau
stage
would
be
the
really
tough
part
of
the
polar
journey
and
no
one
then
dreamed
that
harder
conditions
could
be
found
in
the
middle
of
the
barrier
in
march
than
on
the
plateau
ten
thousand
feet
higher
in
february
in
view
of
the
extreme
conditions
we
knew
we
must
meet
on
this
winter
journey
far
harder
of
course
in
point
of
weather
than
anything
experienced
on
the
polar
journey
we
had
determined
to
simplify
our
food
to
the
last
degree
we
only
brought
pemmican
biscuit
butter
and
tea
and
tea
is
not
a
food
only
a
pleasant
stimulant
and
hot
the
pemmican
was
excellent
and
came
from
beauvais
copenhagen
illustration
camp
work
in
a
blizzard
passing
in
the
cooker
wilson
del
the
immediate
advantage
of
this
was
that
we
had
few
food
bags
to
handle
for
each
meal
if
the
air
temperature
is
degrees
of
frost
then
everything
in
the
air
is
about
degrees
of
frost
too
you
have
only
to
untie
the
lashings
of
one
bag
in
a
temperature
with
your
feet
frozen
and
your
fingers
just
nursed
back
after
getting
a
match
to
strike
for
the
candle
you
will
have
tried
several
boxes
metal
to
realize
this
as
an
advantage
the
immediate
and
increasingly
pressing
disadvantage
is
that
you
have
no
sugar
have
you
ever
had
a
craving
for
sugar
which
never
leaves
you
even
when
asleep
it
is
unpleasant
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
craving
for
sweet
things
never
seriously
worried
us
on
this
journey
and
there
must
have
been
some
sugar
in
our
biscuits
which
gave
a
pleasant
sweetness
to
our
tea
or
nightly
hot
water
when
broken
up
and
soaked
in
it
these
biscuits
were
specially
made
for
us
by
huntley
and
palmer
their
composition
was
worked
out
by
wilson
and
that
firm
chemist
and
is
a
secret
but
they
are
probably
the
most
satisfying
biscuit
ever
made
and
i
doubt
whether
they
can
be
improved
upon
there
were
two
kinds
called
emergency
and
antarctic
but
there
was
i
think
little
difference
between
them
except
in
the
baking
a
biscuit
was
good
to
eat
when
sledging
if
your
supply
of
food
was
good
but
if
you
were
very
hungry
an
underbaked
one
was
much
preferred
by
taking
individually
different
quantities
of
biscuit
pemmican
and
butter
we
were
able
roughly
to
test
the
proportions
of
proteids
fats
and
wanted
by
the
human
body
under
such
extreme
circumstances
bill
was
all
for
fat
starting
with
oz
butter
oz
pemmican
and
only
oz
biscuit
a
day
bowers
told
me
he
was
going
for
proteids
oz
pemmican
and
oz
biscuit
and
suggested
i
should
go
the
whole
hog
on
i
did
not
like
this
since
i
knew
i
should
want
more
fat
but
the
rations
were
to
be
altered
as
necessary
during
the
journey
so
there
was
no
harm
in
trying
so
i
started
with
oz
of
biscuit
and
oz
of
pemmican
a
day
bowers
was
all
right
this
was
usual
with
him
but
he
did
not
eat
all
his
extra
pemmican
bill
could
not
eat
all
his
extra
butter
but
was
satisfied
i
got
hungry
certainly
got
more
than
the
others
and
wanted
more
fat
i
also
got
heartburn
however
before
taking
more
fat
i
increased
my
biscuits
to
but
this
did
not
satisfy
me
i
wanted
fat
bill
and
i
now
took
the
same
diet
he
giving
me
oz
of
butter
which
he
could
not
eat
and
i
giving
him
oz
of
biscuit
which
did
not
satisfy
my
wants
we
both
therefore
had
oz
pemmican
oz
biscuit
and
oz
butter
a
day
but
we
did
not
always
finish
our
butter
this
is
an
extremely
good
ration
and
we
had
enough
to
eat
during
most
of
this
journey
we
certainly
could
not
have
faced
the
conditions
without
i
will
not
say
that
i
was
entirely
easy
in
my
mind
as
we
lay
out
that
blizzard
somewhere
off
terror
point
i
do
know
how
the
others
were
feeling
the
unearthly
banging
going
on
underneath
us
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
we
were
quite
lost
in
the
pressure
and
it
might
be
the
deuce
and
all
to
get
out
in
the
dark
the
wind
eddied
and
swirled
quite
out
of
its
usual
straightforward
way
and
the
tent
got
badly
snowed
up
our
sledge
had
disappeared
long
ago
the
position
was
not
altogether
a
comfortable
one
tuesday
night
and
wednesday
it
blew
up
to
force
temperature
from
to
and
then
it
began
to
modify
and
get
squally
by
on
thursday
july
the
wind
had
nearly
ceased
the
temperature
was
falling
and
the
stars
were
shining
through
detached
clouds
we
were
soon
getting
our
breakfast
which
always
consisted
of
tea
followed
by
pemmican
we
soaked
our
biscuits
in
both
then
we
set
to
work
to
dig
out
the
sledges
and
tent
a
big
job
taking
several
hours
at
last
we
got
started
in
that
jerky
way
in
which
i
was
still
managing
to
jot
a
few
sentences
down
each
night
as
a
record
i
wrote
did
miles
during
day
seems
a
marvellous
run
rose
and
fell
over
several
ridges
of
terror
in
afternoon
suddenly
came
on
huge
crevasse
on
one
of
these
we
were
quite
high
on
terror
moon
saved
us
walking
in
it
might
have
taken
sledge
and
all
to
do
seven
miles
in
a
day
a
distance
which
had
taken
us
nearly
a
week
in
the
past
was
very
heartening
the
temperature
was
between
and
all
day
and
that
was
good
too
when
crossing
the
undulations
which
ran
down
out
of
the
mountain
into
the
true
pressure
ridges
on
our
right
we
found
that
the
wind
which
came
down
off
the
mountain
struck
along
the
top
of
the
undulation
and
flowing
each
way
caused
a
breeze
on
one
side
and
a
breeze
on
the
other
there
seemed
to
be
wind
in
the
sky
and
the
blizzard
had
not
cleared
as
far
away
as
we
should
have
wished
during
the
time
through
which
we
had
come
it
was
by
burning
more
oil
than
is
usually
allowed
for
cooking
that
we
kept
going
at
all
after
each
meal
was
cooked
we
allowed
the
primus
to
burn
on
for
a
while
and
thus
warmed
up
the
tent
then
we
could
nurse
back
our
frozen
feet
and
do
any
necessary
little
odd
jobs
more
often
we
just
sat
and
nodded
for
a
few
minutes
keeping
one
another
from
going
too
deeply
to
sleep
but
it
was
running
away
with
the
oil
we
started
with
tins
those
tins
scott
had
criticized
and
we
had
now
used
four
of
them
at
first
we
said
we
must
have
at
least
two
tins
with
which
to
go
back
but
by
now
our
estimate
had
come
down
to
one
full
gallon
tin
and
two
full
primus
lamps
our
were
awful
it
took
me
even
as
early
in
the
journey
as
this
an
hour
of
pushing
and
thumping
and
cramp
every
night
to
thaw
out
enough
of
mine
to
get
into
it
at
all
even
that
was
not
so
bad
as
lying
in
them
when
we
got
there
only
but
a
very
bad
night
according
to
my
diary
we
got
away
in
good
time
but
it
was
a
ghastly
day
and
my
nerves
were
quivering
at
the
end
for
we
could
not
find
that
straight
and
narrow
way
which
led
between
the
crevasses
on
either
hand
time
after
time
we
found
we
were
out
of
our
course
by
the
sudden
fall
of
the
ground
beneath
our
feet
in
we
went
and
then
are
we
too
far
right
nobody
knows
well
let
try
nearer
in
to
the
mountain
and
so
forth
by
hard
slogging
miles
this
morning
then
on
in
thick
gloom
which
suddenly
lifted
and
we
found
ourselves
under
a
huge
great
mountain
of
pressure
ridge
looking
black
in
shadow
we
went
on
bending
to
the
left
when
bill
fell
and
put
his
arm
into
a
crevasse
we
went
over
this
and
another
and
some
time
after
got
somewhere
up
to
the
left
and
both
bill
and
i
put
a
foot
into
a
crevasse
we
sounded
all
about
and
everywhere
was
hollow
and
so
we
ran
the
sledge
down
over
it
and
all
was
well
once
we
got
right
into
the
pressure
and
took
a
longish
time
to
get
out
again
bill
lengthened
his
trace
out
with
the
alpine
rope
now
and
often
afterwards
so
he
found
the
crevasses
well
ahead
of
us
and
the
sledge
nice
for
us
but
not
so
nice
for
bill
crevasses
in
the
dark
put
your
nerves
on
edge
when
we
started
next
morning
july
we
could
see
on
our
left
front
and
more
or
less
on
top
of
us
the
knoll
which
is
a
big
hill
whose
precipitous
cliffs
to
seaward
form
cape
crozier
the
sides
of
it
sloped
down
towards
us
and
pressing
against
its
on
ahead
were
miles
and
miles
of
great
pressure
ridges
along
which
we
had
travelled
and
which
hemmed
us
in
mount
terror
rose
ten
thousand
feet
high
on
our
left
and
was
connected
with
the
knoll
by
a
great
drift
of
snow
the
slope
of
this
in
one
place
runs
gently
out
on
to
the
corridor
along
which
we
had
sledged
and
here
we
turned
and
started
to
pull
our
sledges
up
there
were
no
crevasses
only
the
great
drift
of
snow
so
hard
that
we
used
our
crampons
just
as
though
we
had
been
on
ice
and
as
polished
as
the
china
sides
of
a
giant
cup
which
it
resembled
for
three
miles
we
slogged
up
until
we
were
only
yards
from
the
moraine
shelf
where
we
were
going
to
build
our
hut
of
rocks
and
snow
this
moraine
was
above
us
on
our
left
the
twin
peaks
of
the
knoll
were
across
the
cup
on
our
right
and
here
feet
up
the
mountain
side
we
pitched
our
last
camp
we
had
arrived
what
should
we
call
our
hut
how
soon
could
we
get
our
clothes
and
bags
dry
how
would
the
blubber
stove
work
would
the
penguins
be
there
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
days
out
surely
seldom
has
any
one
been
so
wet
our
bags
hardly
possible
to
get
into
our
just
frozen
boxes
birdie
patent
balaclava
is
like
iron
it
is
wonderful
how
our
cares
have
vanished
it
was
evening
but
we
were
so
keen
to
begin
that
we
went
straight
up
to
the
ridge
above
our
camp
where
the
rock
cropped
out
from
the
snow
we
found
that
most
of
it
was
but
that
there
were
plenty
of
boulders
some
gravel
and
of
course
any
amount
of
the
icy
snow
which
fell
away
below
us
down
to
our
tent
and
the
great
pressure
about
a
mile
beyond
between
us
and
that
pressure
as
we
were
to
find
out
afterwards
was
a
great
the
pressure
ridges
and
the
great
ice
barrier
beyond
were
at
our
feet
the
ross
sea
edge
but
some
four
miles
away
the
emperors
must
be
somewhere
round
that
shoulder
of
the
knoll
which
hides
cape
crozier
itself
from
our
view
our
scheme
was
to
build
an
igloo
with
rock
walls
banked
up
with
snow
using
a
sledge
as
a
ridge
beam
and
a
large
sheet
of
green
willesden
canvas
as
a
roof
we
had
also
brought
a
board
to
form
a
lintel
over
the
door
here
with
the
stove
which
was
to
be
fed
with
blubber
from
the
penguins
we
were
to
have
a
comfortable
warm
home
whence
we
would
make
excursions
to
the
rookery
perhaps
four
miles
away
perhaps
we
would
manage
to
get
our
tent
down
to
the
rookery
itself
and
do
our
scientific
work
there
on
the
spot
leaving
our
nice
hut
for
a
night
or
more
that
is
how
we
planned
it
that
same
night
we
started
to
dig
in
under
a
great
boulder
on
the
top
of
the
hill
hoping
to
make
this
a
large
part
of
one
of
the
walls
of
the
hut
but
the
rock
came
close
underneath
and
stopped
us
we
then
chose
a
moderately
level
piece
of
moraine
about
twelve
feet
away
and
just
under
the
level
of
the
top
of
the
hill
hoping
that
here
in
the
lee
of
the
ridge
we
might
escape
a
good
deal
of
the
tremendous
winds
which
we
knew
were
common
birdie
gathered
rocks
from
over
the
hill
nothing
was
too
big
for
him
bill
did
the
banking
up
outside
while
i
built
the
wall
with
the
boulders
the
rocks
were
good
the
snow
however
was
blown
so
hard
as
to
be
practically
ice
a
pick
made
little
impression
upon
it
and
the
only
way
was
to
chip
out
big
blocks
gradually
with
the
small
shovel
the
gravel
was
scanty
but
good
when
there
was
any
altogether
things
looked
very
hopeful
when
we
turned
in
to
the
tent
some
yards
down
the
slope
having
done
about
half
one
of
the
long
walls
the
view
from
eight
hundred
feet
up
the
mountain
was
magnificent
and
i
got
my
spectacles
out
and
cleared
the
ice
away
time
after
time
to
look
to
the
east
a
great
field
of
pressure
ridges
below
looking
in
the
moonlight
as
if
giants
had
been
ploughing
with
ploughs
which
made
furrows
fifty
or
sixty
feet
deep
these
ran
right
up
to
the
barrier
edge
and
beyond
was
the
frozen
ross
sea
lying
flat
white
and
peaceful
as
though
such
things
as
blizzards
were
unknown
to
the
north
and
the
knoll
behind
us
mount
terror
on
which
we
stood
and
over
all
the
grey
limitless
barrier
seemed
to
cast
a
spell
of
cold
immensity
vague
ponderous
a
of
wind
and
drift
and
darkness
god
what
a
place
there
was
now
little
moonlight
or
daylight
but
for
the
next
hours
we
used
both
to
their
utmost
being
up
at
all
times
by
day
and
night
and
often
working
on
when
there
was
great
difficulty
in
seeing
anything
digging
by
the
light
of
the
hurricane
lamp
by
the
end
of
two
days
we
had
the
walls
built
and
banked
up
to
one
or
two
feet
from
the
top
we
were
to
fit
the
roof
cloth
close
before
banking
up
the
rest
the
great
difficulty
in
banking
was
the
hardness
of
the
snow
it
being
impossible
to
fill
in
the
cracks
between
the
blocks
which
were
more
like
than
anything
else
the
door
was
in
being
a
triangular
tent
doorway
with
flaps
which
we
built
close
in
to
the
walls
cementing
it
with
snow
and
rocks
the
top
folded
over
a
plank
and
the
bottom
was
dug
into
the
ground
birdie
was
very
disappointed
that
we
could
not
finish
the
whole
thing
that
day
he
was
nearly
angry
about
it
but
there
was
a
lot
to
do
yet
and
we
were
tired
out
we
turned
out
early
the
next
morning
tuesday
to
try
and
finish
the
igloo
but
it
was
blowing
too
hard
when
we
got
to
the
top
we
did
some
digging
but
it
was
quite
impossible
to
get
the
roof
on
and
we
had
to
leave
it
we
realized
that
day
that
it
blew
much
harder
at
the
top
of
the
slope
than
where
our
tent
was
it
was
bitterly
cold
up
there
that
morning
with
a
wind
force
and
a
minus
thirty
temperature
the
oil
question
was
worrying
us
quite
a
lot
we
were
now
well
in
to
the
fifth
of
our
six
tins
and
economizing
as
much
as
possible
often
having
only
two
hot
meals
a
day
we
had
to
get
down
to
the
emperor
penguins
somehow
and
get
some
blubber
to
run
the
stove
which
had
been
made
for
us
in
the
hut
the
being
a
calm
fine
day
we
started
at
with
an
empty
sledge
two
alpine
rope
harnesses
and
skinning
tools
wilson
had
made
this
journey
through
the
cape
crozier
pressure
ridges
several
times
in
the
discovery
days
but
then
they
had
daylight
and
they
had
found
a
practicable
way
close
under
the
cliffs
which
at
the
present
moment
were
between
us
and
the
ridges
as
we
neared
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
slope
farther
to
the
north
than
we
had
previously
gone
we
had
to
be
careful
about
crevasses
but
we
soon
hit
off
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
skirted
along
it
until
it
petered
out
on
the
same
level
as
the
barrier
turning
left
handed
we
headed
towards
the
knowing
that
there
were
some
two
miles
of
pressure
between
us
and
cape
crozier
itself
for
about
half
a
mile
it
was
fair
going
rounding
big
knobs
of
pressure
but
always
managing
to
keep
more
or
less
on
the
flat
and
near
the
which
soon
rose
to
a
very
great
height
on
our
left
bill
idea
was
to
try
and
keep
close
under
this
cliff
along
that
same
discovery
way
which
i
have
mentioned
above
they
never
arrived
there
early
enough
for
the
eggs
in
those
days
the
chicks
were
hatched
whether
we
should
now
find
any
emperors
and
if
so
whether
they
would
have
any
eggs
was
by
no
means
certain
however
we
soon
began
to
get
into
trouble
meeting
several
crevasses
every
few
yards
and
i
have
no
doubt
crossing
scores
of
others
of
which
we
had
no
knowledge
though
we
hugged
the
cliffs
as
close
as
possible
we
found
ourselves
on
the
top
of
the
first
pressure
ridge
separated
by
a
deep
gulf
from
the
which
we
wished
to
reach
then
we
were
in
a
great
valley
between
the
first
and
second
ridges
we
got
into
huge
heaps
of
ice
pressed
up
in
every
shape
on
every
side
crevassed
in
every
direction
we
slithered
over
and
crawled
along
drift
ridges
trying
to
get
in
towards
the
cliffs
and
always
we
came
up
against
impossible
places
and
had
to
crawl
back
bill
led
on
a
length
of
alpine
rope
fastened
to
the
toggle
of
the
sledge
birdie
was
in
his
harness
also
fastened
to
the
toggle
and
i
was
in
my
harness
fastened
to
the
rear
of
the
sledge
which
was
of
great
use
to
us
both
as
a
bridge
and
a
ladder
two
or
three
times
we
tried
to
get
down
the
to
the
comparatively
level
road
under
the
cliff
but
it
was
always
too
great
a
drop
in
that
dim
light
every
proportion
was
distorted
some
of
the
places
we
actually
did
manage
to
negotiate
with
and
alpine
rope
looked
absolute
precipices
and
there
were
always
crevasses
at
the
bottom
if
you
slipped
on
the
way
back
i
did
slip
into
one
of
these
and
was
hauled
out
by
the
other
two
standing
on
the
wall
above
me
we
then
worked
our
way
down
into
the
hollow
between
the
first
and
second
large
pressure
ridges
and
i
believe
on
to
the
top
of
the
second
the
crests
here
rose
fifty
or
sixty
feet
after
this
i
do
know
where
we
went
our
best
landmarks
were
patches
of
crevasses
sometimes
three
or
four
in
a
few
footsteps
the
temperatures
were
lowish
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
wear
spectacles
and
this
was
a
tremendous
difficulty
to
me
and
handicap
to
the
party
bill
would
find
a
crevasse
and
point
it
out
birdie
would
cross
and
then
time
after
time
in
trying
to
step
over
or
climb
over
on
the
sledge
i
put
my
feet
right
into
the
middle
of
the
cracks
this
day
i
went
well
in
at
least
six
times
once
when
we
were
close
to
the
sea
rolling
into
and
out
of
one
and
then
down
a
steep
slope
until
brought
up
by
birdie
and
bill
on
the
rope
illustration
a
procession
of
emperors
illustration
the
knoll
behind
the
cliffs
of
cape
crozier
we
blundered
along
until
we
got
into
a
great
which
probably
formed
the
end
of
the
two
ridges
where
they
butted
on
to
the
on
all
sides
rose
great
walls
of
battered
ice
with
steep
in
the
middle
where
we
slithered
about
and
blundered
into
crevasses
to
the
left
rose
the
huge
cliff
of
cape
crozier
but
we
could
not
tell
whether
there
were
not
two
or
three
pressure
ridges
between
us
and
it
and
though
we
tried
at
least
four
ways
there
was
no
possibility
of
getting
forward
and
then
we
heard
the
emperors
calling
their
cries
came
to
us
from
the
we
could
not
see
but
which
must
have
been
a
chaotic
quarter
of
a
mile
away
they
came
echoing
back
from
the
cliffs
as
we
stood
helpless
and
tantalized
we
listened
and
realized
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
return
for
the
little
light
which
now
came
in
the
middle
of
the
day
was
going
fast
and
to
be
caught
in
absolute
darkness
there
was
a
horrible
idea
we
started
back
on
our
tracks
and
almost
immediately
i
lost
my
footing
and
rolled
down
a
slope
into
a
crevasse
birdie
and
bill
kept
their
balance
and
i
clambered
back
to
them
the
tracks
were
very
faint
and
we
soon
began
to
lose
them
birdie
was
the
best
man
at
following
tracks
that
i
have
ever
known
and
he
found
them
time
after
time
but
at
last
even
he
lost
them
altogether
and
we
settled
we
must
just
go
ahead
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
picked
them
up
again
and
by
then
were
out
of
the
worst
but
we
were
glad
to
see
the
tent
the
next
morning
thursday
june
we
started
work
on
the
igloo
at
and
managed
to
get
the
canvas
roof
on
in
spite
of
a
wind
which
harried
us
all
that
day
little
did
we
think
what
that
roof
had
in
store
for
us
as
we
packed
it
in
with
snow
blocks
stretching
it
over
our
second
sledge
which
we
put
athwartships
across
the
middle
of
the
longer
walls
the
windward
south
end
came
right
down
to
the
ground
and
we
tied
it
securely
to
rocks
before
packing
it
in
on
the
other
three
sides
we
had
a
good
two
feet
or
more
of
slack
all
round
and
in
every
case
we
tied
it
to
rocks
by
lanyards
at
intervals
of
two
feet
the
door
was
the
difficulty
and
for
the
present
we
left
the
cloth
arching
over
the
stones
forming
a
kind
of
portico
the
whole
was
well
packed
in
and
over
with
slabs
of
hard
snow
but
there
was
no
soft
snow
with
which
to
fill
up
the
gaps
between
the
blocks
however
we
felt
already
that
nothing
could
drag
that
roof
out
of
its
packing
and
subsequent
events
proved
that
we
were
right
it
was
a
bleak
job
for
three
in
the
morning
before
breakfast
and
we
were
glad
to
get
back
to
the
tent
and
a
meal
for
we
meant
to
have
another
go
at
the
emperors
that
day
with
the
first
glimpse
of
light
we
were
off
for
the
rookery
again
but
we
now
knew
one
or
two
things
about
that
pressure
which
we
had
not
known
hours
ago
for
instance
that
there
was
a
lot
of
alteration
since
the
discovery
days
and
that
probably
the
pressure
was
bigger
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
has
been
since
proved
by
photographs
that
the
ridges
now
ran
out
of
a
mile
farther
into
the
sea
than
they
did
ten
years
before
we
knew
also
that
if
we
entered
the
pressure
at
the
only
place
where
the
came
down
to
the
level
of
the
barrier
as
we
did
yesterday
we
could
neither
penetrate
to
the
rookery
nor
get
in
under
the
cliffs
where
formerly
a
possible
way
had
been
found
there
was
only
one
other
thing
to
do
to
go
over
the
cliff
and
this
was
what
we
proposed
to
try
and
do
now
these
are
some
two
hundred
feet
high
and
i
felt
uncomfortable
especially
in
the
dark
but
as
we
came
back
the
day
before
we
had
noticed
at
one
place
a
break
in
the
cliffs
from
which
there
hung
a
it
be
possible
to
get
down
that
drift
and
so
all
harnessed
to
the
sledge
with
bill
on
a
long
lead
out
in
front
and
birdie
and
myself
checking
the
sledge
behind
we
started
down
the
slope
which
ended
in
the
cliff
which
of
course
we
could
not
see
we
crossed
a
number
of
small
crevasses
and
soon
we
knew
we
must
be
nearly
there
twice
we
crept
up
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
with
no
success
and
then
we
found
the
slope
more
we
got
down
it
without
great
difficulty
and
it
brought
us
out
just
where
we
wanted
to
be
between
the
land
cliffs
and
the
pressure
illustration
the
barrier
pressure
at
cape
crozier
then
began
the
most
exciting
climb
among
the
pressure
that
you
can
imagine
at
first
very
much
as
it
was
the
day
before
pulling
ourselves
and
one
another
up
ridges
slithering
down
slopes
tumbling
into
and
out
of
crevasses
and
holes
of
all
sorts
we
made
our
way
along
under
the
cliffs
which
rose
higher
and
higher
above
us
as
we
neared
the
black
lava
precipices
which
form
cape
crozier
itself
we
straddled
along
the
top
of
a
snow
ridge
with
a
edge
balancing
the
sledge
between
us
as
we
wriggled
on
our
right
was
a
drop
of
great
depth
with
crevasses
at
the
bottom
on
our
left
was
a
smaller
drop
also
crevassed
we
crawled
along
and
i
can
tell
you
it
was
exciting
work
in
the
more
than
half
darkness
at
the
end
was
a
series
of
slopes
full
of
crevasses
and
finally
we
got
right
in
under
the
rock
on
to
moraine
and
here
we
had
to
leave
the
sledge
we
roped
up
and
started
to
worry
along
under
the
cliffs
which
had
now
changed
from
ice
to
rock
and
rose
feet
above
us
the
tumult
of
pressure
which
climbed
against
them
showed
no
order
here
four
hundred
miles
of
moving
ice
behind
it
had
just
tossed
and
twisted
those
giant
ridges
until
job
himself
would
have
lacked
words
to
reproach
their
maker
we
scrambled
over
and
under
hanging
on
with
our
axes
and
cutting
steps
where
we
could
not
find
a
foothold
with
our
crampons
and
always
we
got
towards
the
emperor
penguins
and
it
really
began
to
look
as
if
we
were
going
to
do
it
this
time
when
we
came
up
against
a
wall
of
ice
which
a
single
glance
told
us
we
could
never
cross
one
of
the
largest
pressure
ridges
had
been
thrown
end
on
against
the
cliff
we
seemed
to
be
stopped
when
bill
found
a
black
hole
something
like
a
fox
earth
disappearing
into
the
bowels
of
the
ice
we
looked
at
it
well
here
goes
he
said
and
put
his
head
in
and
disappeared
bowers
likewise
it
was
a
longish
way
but
quite
possible
to
wriggle
along
and
presently
i
found
myself
looking
out
of
the
other
side
with
a
deep
gully
below
me
the
rock
face
on
one
hand
and
the
ice
on
the
other
put
your
back
against
the
ice
and
your
feet
against
the
rock
and
lever
yourself
along
said
bill
who
was
already
standing
on
firm
ice
at
the
far
end
in
a
snow
pit
we
cut
some
fifteen
steps
to
get
out
of
that
hole
excited
by
now
and
thoroughly
enjoying
ourselves
we
found
the
way
ahead
easier
until
the
penguins
call
reached
us
again
and
we
stood
three
crystallized
ragamuffins
above
the
emperors
home
they
were
there
all
right
and
we
were
going
to
reach
them
but
where
were
all
the
thousands
of
which
we
had
heard
we
stood
on
an
which
was
really
a
dwarf
cliff
some
twelve
feet
high
and
the
with
a
good
many
strewn
upon
it
lay
below
the
cliff
dropped
straight
with
a
bit
of
an
overhang
and
no
this
may
have
been
because
the
sea
had
only
frozen
recently
whatever
the
reason
may
have
been
it
meant
that
we
should
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
in
getting
up
again
without
help
it
was
decided
that
some
one
must
stop
on
the
top
with
the
alpine
rope
and
clearly
that
one
should
be
i
for
with
short
sight
and
fogged
spectacles
which
i
could
not
wear
i
was
much
the
least
useful
of
the
party
for
the
job
immediately
ahead
had
we
had
the
sledge
we
could
have
used
it
as
a
ladder
but
of
course
we
had
left
this
at
the
beginning
of
the
moraine
miles
back
we
saw
the
emperors
standing
all
together
huddled
under
the
barrier
cliff
some
hundreds
of
yards
away
the
little
light
was
going
fast
we
were
much
more
excited
about
the
approach
of
complete
darkness
and
the
look
of
wind
in
the
south
than
we
were
about
our
triumph
after
indescribable
effort
and
hardship
we
were
witnessing
a
marvel
of
the
natural
world
and
we
were
the
first
and
only
men
who
had
ever
done
so
we
had
within
our
grasp
material
which
might
prove
of
the
utmost
importance
to
science
we
were
turning
theories
into
facts
with
every
observation
we
made
and
we
had
but
a
moment
to
give
illustration
emperors
barrier
and
sea
ice
wilson
del
the
disturbed
emperors
made
a
tremendous
row
trumpeting
with
their
curious
metallic
voices
there
was
no
doubt
they
had
eggs
for
they
tried
to
shuffle
along
the
ground
without
losing
them
off
their
feet
but
when
they
were
hustled
a
good
many
eggs
were
dropped
and
left
lying
on
the
ice
and
some
of
these
were
quickly
picked
up
by
eggless
emperors
who
had
probably
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
the
opportunity
in
these
poor
birds
the
maternal
side
seems
to
have
necessarily
swamped
the
other
functions
of
life
such
is
the
struggle
for
existence
that
they
can
only
live
by
a
glut
of
maternity
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
whether
such
a
life
leads
to
happiness
or
satisfaction
i
have
told
how
the
men
of
the
discovery
found
this
rookery
where
we
now
stood
how
they
made
journeys
in
the
early
spring
but
never
arrived
early
enough
to
get
eggs
and
only
found
parents
and
chicks
they
concluded
that
the
emperor
was
an
impossible
kind
of
bird
who
for
some
reason
or
other
nests
in
the
middle
of
the
antarctic
winter
with
the
temperature
anywhere
below
seventy
degrees
of
frost
and
the
blizzards
blowing
always
blowing
against
his
devoted
back
and
they
found
him
holding
his
precious
chick
balanced
upon
his
big
feet
and
pressing
it
maternally
or
paternally
for
both
sexes
squabble
for
the
privilege
against
a
bald
patch
in
his
breast
and
when
at
last
he
simply
must
go
and
eat
something
in
the
open
leads
near
by
he
just
puts
the
child
down
on
the
ice
and
twenty
chickless
emperors
rush
to
pick
it
up
and
they
fight
over
it
and
so
tear
it
that
sometimes
it
will
die
and
if
it
can
it
will
crawl
into
any
to
escape
from
so
much
kindness
and
there
it
will
freeze
likewise
many
broken
and
addled
eggs
were
found
and
it
is
clear
that
the
mortality
is
very
great
but
some
survive
and
summer
comes
and
when
a
big
blizzard
is
going
to
blow
they
know
all
about
the
weather
the
parents
take
the
children
out
for
miles
across
the
until
they
reach
the
threshold
of
the
open
sea
and
there
they
sit
until
the
wind
comes
and
the
swell
rises
and
breaks
that
off
and
away
they
go
in
the
blinding
drift
to
join
the
main
with
a
private
yacht
all
to
themselves
you
must
agree
that
a
bird
like
this
is
an
interesting
beast
and
when
seven
months
ago
we
rowed
a
boat
under
those
great
black
cliffs
and
found
a
disconsolate
emperor
chick
still
in
the
down
we
knew
definitely
why
the
emperor
has
to
nest
in
for
if
a
june
egg
was
still
without
feathers
in
the
beginning
of
january
the
same
egg
laid
in
the
summer
would
leave
its
produce
without
practical
covering
for
the
following
winter
thus
the
emperor
penguin
is
compelled
to
undertake
all
kinds
of
hardships
because
his
children
insist
on
developing
so
slowly
very
much
as
we
are
tied
in
our
human
relationships
for
the
same
reason
it
is
of
interest
that
such
a
primitive
bird
should
have
so
long
a
childhood
but
interesting
as
the
life
history
of
these
birds
must
be
we
had
not
travelled
for
three
weeks
to
see
them
sitting
on
their
eggs
we
wanted
the
embryos
and
we
wanted
them
as
young
as
possible
and
fresh
and
unfrozen
that
specialists
at
home
might
cut
them
into
microscopic
sections
and
learn
from
them
the
previous
history
of
birds
throughout
the
evolutionary
ages
and
so
bill
and
birdie
rapidly
collected
five
eggs
which
we
hoped
to
carry
safely
in
our
fur
mitts
to
our
igloo
upon
mount
terror
where
we
could
pickle
them
in
the
alcohol
we
had
brought
for
the
purpose
we
also
wanted
oil
for
our
blubber
stove
and
they
killed
and
skinned
three
birds
an
emperor
weighs
up
to
stones
the
ross
sea
was
frozen
over
and
there
were
no
seal
in
sight
there
were
only
emperors
as
compared
with
in
and
bill
reckoned
that
every
fourth
or
fifth
bird
had
an
egg
but
this
was
only
a
rough
estimate
for
we
did
not
want
to
disturb
them
unnecessarily
it
is
a
mystery
why
there
should
have
been
so
few
birds
but
it
certainly
looked
as
though
the
ice
had
not
formed
very
long
were
these
the
first
arrivals
had
a
previous
rookery
been
blown
out
to
sea
and
was
this
the
beginning
of
a
second
attempt
is
this
bay
of
becoming
unsafe
those
who
previously
discovered
the
emperors
with
their
chicks
saw
the
penguins
nursing
dead
and
frozen
chicks
if
they
were
unable
to
obtain
a
live
one
they
also
found
decomposed
eggs
which
they
must
have
incubated
after
they
had
been
frozen
now
we
found
that
these
birds
were
so
anxious
to
sit
on
something
that
some
of
those
which
had
no
eggs
were
sitting
on
ice
several
times
bill
and
birdie
picked
up
eggs
to
find
them
lumps
of
ice
rounded
and
about
the
right
size
dirty
and
hard
once
a
bird
dropped
an
ice
nest
egg
as
they
watched
and
again
a
bird
returned
and
tucked
another
into
itself
immediately
forsaking
it
for
a
real
one
however
when
one
was
offered
meanwhile
a
whole
procession
of
emperors
came
round
under
the
cliff
on
which
i
stood
the
light
was
already
very
bad
and
it
was
well
that
my
companions
were
quick
in
returning
we
had
to
do
everything
in
a
great
hurry
i
hauled
up
the
eggs
in
their
mitts
which
we
fastened
together
round
our
necks
with
lampwick
lanyards
and
then
the
skins
but
failed
to
help
bill
at
all
pull
he
cried
from
the
bottom
i
am
pulling
i
said
but
the
line
quite
slack
down
here
he
shouted
and
when
he
had
reached
the
top
by
climbing
up
on
bowers
shoulders
and
we
were
both
pulling
all
we
knew
birdie
end
of
the
rope
was
still
slack
in
his
hands
directly
we
put
on
a
strain
the
rope
cut
into
the
ice
edge
and
jammed
a
very
common
difficulty
when
working
among
crevasses
we
tried
to
run
the
rope
over
an
without
success
and
things
began
to
look
serious
when
birdie
who
had
been
running
about
prospecting
and
had
meanwhile
put
one
leg
through
a
crack
into
the
sea
found
a
place
where
the
cliff
did
not
overhang
he
cut
steps
for
himself
we
hauled
and
at
last
we
were
all
together
on
the
top
his
foot
being
by
now
surrounded
by
a
solid
mass
of
ice
we
legged
it
back
as
hard
as
we
could
go
five
eggs
in
our
fur
mitts
birdie
with
two
skins
tied
to
him
and
trailing
behind
and
myself
with
one
we
were
roped
up
and
climbing
the
ridges
and
getting
through
the
holes
was
very
difficult
in
one
place
where
there
was
a
steep
rubble
and
snow
slope
down
i
left
the
half
way
up
in
another
it
was
too
dark
to
see
our
former
footsteps
and
i
could
see
nothing
and
so
just
let
myself
go
and
trusted
to
luck
with
infinite
patience
bill
said
cherry
you
learn
how
to
use
an
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
my
were
in
rags
we
found
the
sledge
and
none
too
soon
and
now
had
three
eggs
left
more
or
less
whole
both
mine
had
burst
in
my
mitts
the
first
i
emptied
out
the
second
i
left
in
my
mitt
to
put
into
the
cooker
it
never
got
there
but
on
the
return
journey
i
had
my
mitts
far
more
easily
thawed
out
than
birdie
bill
had
none
and
i
believe
the
grease
in
the
egg
did
them
good
when
we
got
into
the
hollows
under
the
ridge
where
we
had
to
cross
it
was
too
dark
to
do
anything
but
feel
our
way
we
did
so
over
many
crevasses
found
the
ridge
and
crept
over
it
higher
up
we
could
see
more
but
to
follow
our
tracks
soon
became
impossible
and
we
plugged
straight
ahead
and
luckily
found
the
slope
down
which
we
had
come
all
day
it
had
been
blowing
a
nasty
cold
wind
with
a
temperature
between
and
which
we
felt
a
good
deal
now
it
began
to
get
worse
the
weather
was
getting
thick
and
things
did
not
look
very
nice
when
we
started
up
to
find
our
tent
soon
it
was
blowing
force
and
soon
we
missed
our
way
entirely
we
got
right
up
above
the
patch
of
rocks
which
marked
our
igloo
and
only
found
it
after
a
good
deal
of
search
i
have
heard
tell
of
an
english
officer
at
the
dardanelles
who
was
left
blinded
in
no
man
land
between
the
english
and
turkish
trenches
moving
only
at
night
and
having
no
sense
to
tell
him
which
were
his
own
trenches
he
was
fired
at
by
turk
and
english
alike
as
he
groped
his
ghastly
way
to
and
from
them
thus
he
spent
days
and
nights
until
one
night
he
crawled
towards
the
english
trenches
to
be
fired
at
as
usual
oh
god
what
can
i
do
some
one
heard
him
say
and
he
was
brought
in
such
extremity
of
suffering
can
not
be
measured
madness
or
death
may
give
relief
but
this
i
know
we
on
this
journey
were
already
beginning
to
think
of
death
as
a
friend
as
we
groped
our
way
back
that
night
sleepless
icy
and
in
the
dark
and
the
wind
and
the
drift
a
crevasse
seemed
almost
a
friendly
gift
things
must
improve
said
bill
next
day
i
think
we
reached
last
night
we
had
by
a
long
way
it
was
like
this
we
moved
into
the
igloo
for
the
first
time
for
we
had
to
save
oil
by
using
our
blubber
stove
if
we
were
to
have
any
left
to
travel
home
with
and
we
did
not
wish
to
cover
our
tent
with
the
oily
black
filth
which
the
use
of
blubber
necessitates
the
blizzard
blew
all
night
and
we
were
covered
with
drift
which
came
in
through
hundreds
of
leaks
in
this
place
we
had
found
no
soft
snow
with
which
we
could
pack
our
hard
snow
blocks
as
we
flensed
some
blubber
from
one
of
our
penguin
skins
the
powdery
drift
covered
everything
we
had
though
uncomfortable
this
was
nothing
to
worry
about
overmuch
some
of
the
drift
which
the
blizzard
was
bringing
would
collect
to
leeward
of
our
hut
and
the
rocks
below
which
it
was
built
and
they
could
be
used
to
make
our
hut
more
then
with
great
difficulty
we
got
the
blubber
stove
to
start
and
it
spouted
a
blob
of
boiling
oil
into
eye
for
the
rest
of
the
night
he
lay
quite
unable
to
stifle
his
groans
obviously
in
very
great
pain
he
told
us
afterwards
that
he
thought
his
eye
was
gone
we
managed
to
cook
a
meal
somehow
and
birdie
got
the
stove
going
afterwards
but
it
was
quite
useless
to
try
and
warm
the
place
i
got
out
and
cut
the
green
canvas
outside
the
door
so
as
to
get
the
roof
cloth
in
under
the
stones
and
then
packed
it
down
as
well
as
i
could
with
snow
and
so
blocked
most
of
the
drift
coming
in
it
is
extraordinary
how
often
angels
and
fools
do
the
same
thing
in
this
life
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
settle
which
we
were
on
this
journey
i
never
heard
an
angry
word
once
only
when
this
same
day
i
could
not
pull
bill
up
the
cliff
out
of
the
penguin
rookery
i
heard
an
impatient
one
and
these
groans
were
the
nearest
approach
to
complaint
most
men
would
have
howled
i
think
we
reached
last
night
was
strong
language
for
bill
i
was
incapacitated
for
a
short
time
he
says
in
his
report
to
scott
endurance
was
tested
on
this
journey
under
unique
circumstances
and
always
these
two
men
with
all
the
burden
of
responsibility
which
did
not
fall
upon
myself
displayed
that
quality
which
is
perhaps
the
only
one
which
may
be
said
with
certainty
to
make
for
success
we
spent
the
next
day
it
was
july
in
collecting
every
scrap
of
soft
snow
we
could
find
and
packing
it
into
the
crevasses
between
our
hard
snow
blocks
it
was
a
pitifully
small
amount
but
we
could
see
no
cracks
when
we
had
finished
to
counteract
the
lifting
tendency
the
wind
had
on
our
roof
we
cut
some
great
flat
hard
snow
blocks
and
laid
them
on
the
canvas
top
to
steady
it
against
the
sledge
which
formed
the
ridge
support
we
also
pitched
our
tent
outside
the
igloo
door
both
tent
and
igloo
were
therefore
eight
or
nine
hundred
feet
up
terror
both
were
below
an
outcrop
of
rocks
from
which
the
mountain
fell
steeply
to
the
barrier
behind
us
and
from
this
direction
came
the
blizzards
in
front
of
us
the
slope
fell
for
a
mile
or
more
down
to
the
so
that
we
had
to
wear
crampons
to
walk
upon
it
most
of
the
tent
was
in
the
lee
of
the
igloo
but
the
cap
of
it
came
over
the
igloo
roof
while
a
segment
of
the
tent
itself
jutted
out
beyond
the
igloo
wall
that
night
we
took
much
of
our
gear
into
the
tent
and
lighted
the
blubber
stove
i
always
mistrusted
that
stove
and
every
moment
i
expected
it
to
flare
up
and
burn
the
tent
but
the
heat
it
gave
as
it
burned
furiously
with
the
double
lining
of
the
tent
to
contain
it
was
considerable
it
did
not
matter
except
for
a
routine
which
we
never
managed
to
keep
whether
we
started
to
thaw
our
way
into
our
frozen
at
in
the
morning
or
in
the
afternoon
i
think
we
must
have
turned
in
during
the
afternoon
of
that
friday
leaving
the
cooker
our
finnesko
a
deal
of
our
bowers
bag
of
personal
gear
and
many
other
things
in
the
tent
i
expect
we
left
the
blubber
stove
there
too
for
it
was
quite
useless
at
present
to
try
and
warm
the
igloo
the
tent
was
under
our
in
the
igloo
things
must
improve
said
bill
after
all
there
was
much
for
which
to
be
thankful
i
do
think
anybody
could
have
made
a
better
igloo
with
the
hard
snow
blocks
and
rocks
which
were
all
we
had
we
would
get
it
by
degrees
the
blubber
stove
was
working
and
we
had
fuel
for
it
we
had
also
found
a
way
down
to
the
penguins
and
had
three
complete
though
frozen
eggs
the
two
which
had
been
in
my
mitts
smashed
when
i
fell
about
because
i
could
not
wear
spectacles
also
the
twilight
given
by
the
sun
below
the
horizon
at
noon
was
getting
longer
but
already
we
had
been
out
twice
as
long
in
winter
as
the
longest
previous
journeys
in
spring
the
men
who
made
those
journeys
had
daylight
where
we
had
darkness
they
had
never
had
such
low
temperatures
generally
nothing
approaching
them
and
they
had
seldom
worked
in
such
difficult
country
the
nearest
approach
to
healthy
sleep
we
had
had
for
nearly
a
month
was
when
during
blizzards
the
temperature
allowed
the
warmth
of
our
bodies
to
thaw
some
of
the
ice
in
our
clothing
and
into
water
the
wear
and
tear
on
our
minds
was
very
great
we
were
certainly
weaker
we
had
a
little
more
than
a
tin
of
oil
to
get
back
on
and
we
knew
the
conditions
we
had
to
face
on
that
journey
across
the
barrier
even
with
fresh
men
and
fresh
gear
it
had
been
almost
unendurable
and
so
we
spent
half
an
hour
or
more
getting
into
our
bags
cirrus
cloud
was
moving
across
the
face
of
the
stars
from
the
north
it
looked
rather
hazy
and
thick
to
the
south
but
it
is
always
difficult
to
judge
weather
in
the
dark
there
was
little
wind
and
the
temperature
was
in
the
minus
twenties
we
felt
no
particular
uneasiness
our
tent
was
well
dug
in
and
was
also
held
down
by
rocks
and
the
heavy
tank
off
the
sledge
which
were
placed
on
the
skirting
as
additional
security
we
felt
that
no
power
on
earth
could
move
the
thick
walls
of
our
igloo
nor
drag
the
canvas
roof
from
the
middle
of
the
embankment
into
which
it
was
packed
and
lashed
things
must
improve
said
bill
i
do
not
know
what
time
it
was
when
i
woke
up
it
was
calm
with
that
absolute
silence
which
can
be
so
soothing
or
so
terrible
as
circumstances
dictate
then
there
came
a
sob
of
wind
and
all
was
still
again
ten
minutes
and
it
was
blowing
as
though
the
world
was
having
a
fit
of
hysterics
the
earth
was
torn
in
pieces
the
indescribable
fury
and
roar
of
it
all
can
not
be
imagined
bill
bill
the
tent
has
gone
was
the
next
i
remember
from
bowers
shouting
at
us
again
and
again
through
the
door
it
is
always
these
early
morning
shocks
which
hit
one
hardest
our
slow
minds
suggested
that
this
might
mean
a
peculiarly
lingering
form
of
death
journey
after
journey
birdie
and
i
fought
our
way
across
the
few
yards
which
had
separated
the
tent
from
the
igloo
door
i
have
never
understood
why
so
much
of
our
gear
which
was
in
the
tent
remained
even
in
the
lee
of
the
igloo
the
place
where
the
tent
had
been
was
littered
with
gear
and
when
we
came
to
reckon
up
afterwards
we
had
everything
except
the
bottom
piece
of
the
cooker
and
the
top
of
the
outer
cooker
we
never
saw
these
again
the
most
wonderful
thing
of
all
was
that
our
finnesko
were
lying
where
they
were
left
which
happened
to
be
on
the
ground
in
the
part
of
the
tent
which
was
under
the
lee
of
the
igloo
also
birdie
bag
of
personal
gear
was
there
and
a
tin
of
sweets
birdie
brought
two
tins
of
sweets
away
with
him
one
we
had
to
celebrate
our
arrival
at
the
knoll
this
was
the
second
of
which
we
knew
nothing
and
which
was
for
bill
birthday
the
next
day
we
started
eating
them
on
saturday
however
and
the
tin
came
in
useful
to
bill
afterwards
to
get
that
gear
in
we
fought
against
solid
walls
of
black
snow
which
flowed
past
us
and
tried
to
hurl
us
down
the
slope
once
started
nothing
could
have
stopped
us
i
saw
birdie
knocked
over
once
but
he
clawed
his
way
back
just
in
time
having
passed
everything
we
could
find
in
to
bill
we
got
back
into
the
igloo
and
started
to
collect
things
together
including
our
very
dishevelled
minds
there
was
no
doubt
that
we
were
in
the
devil
of
a
mess
and
it
was
not
altogether
our
fault
we
had
had
to
put
our
igloo
more
or
less
where
we
could
get
rocks
with
which
to
build
it
very
naturally
we
had
given
both
our
tent
and
igloo
all
the
shelter
we
could
from
the
full
force
of
the
wind
and
now
it
seemed
we
were
in
danger
not
because
they
were
in
the
wind
but
because
they
were
not
sufficiently
in
it
the
main
force
of
the
hurricane
deflected
by
the
ridge
behind
fled
over
our
heads
and
appeared
to
form
by
suction
a
vacuum
below
our
tent
had
either
been
sucked
upwards
into
this
or
had
been
blown
away
because
some
of
it
was
in
the
wind
while
some
of
it
was
not
the
roof
of
our
igloo
was
being
wrenched
upwards
and
then
dropped
back
with
great
crashes
the
drift
was
spouting
in
not
it
seemed
because
it
was
blown
in
from
outside
but
because
it
was
sucked
in
from
within
the
lee
not
the
weather
wall
was
the
worst
already
everything
was
six
or
eight
inches
under
snow
very
soon
we
began
to
be
alarmed
about
the
igloo
for
some
time
the
heavy
snow
blocks
we
had
heaved
up
on
to
the
canvas
roof
kept
it
weighted
down
but
it
seemed
that
they
were
being
gradually
moved
off
by
the
hurricane
the
tension
became
unendurable
the
waiting
in
all
that
welter
of
noise
was
maddening
minute
after
minute
hour
after
hour
those
snow
blocks
were
off
now
anyway
and
the
roof
was
smashed
up
and
down
no
canvas
ever
made
could
stand
it
indefinitely
we
got
a
meal
that
saturday
morning
our
last
for
a
very
long
time
as
it
happened
oil
being
of
such
importance
to
us
we
tried
to
use
the
blubber
stove
but
after
several
preliminary
spasms
it
came
to
pieces
in
our
hands
some
solder
having
melted
and
a
very
good
thing
too
i
thought
for
it
was
more
dangerous
than
useful
we
finished
cooking
our
meal
on
the
primus
two
bits
of
the
cooker
having
been
blown
away
we
had
to
balance
it
on
the
primus
as
best
we
could
we
then
settled
that
in
view
of
the
shortage
of
oil
we
would
not
have
another
meal
for
as
long
as
possible
as
a
matter
of
fact
god
settled
that
for
us
we
did
all
we
could
to
stop
up
the
places
where
the
drift
was
coming
in
plugging
the
holes
with
our
socks
mitts
and
other
clothing
but
it
was
no
real
good
our
igloo
was
a
vacuum
which
was
filling
itself
up
as
soon
as
possible
and
when
snow
was
not
coming
in
a
fine
black
moraine
dust
took
its
place
covering
us
and
everything
for
hours
we
waited
for
the
roof
to
go
things
were
so
bad
now
that
we
dare
not
unlash
the
door
many
hours
ago
bill
had
told
us
that
if
the
roof
went
he
considered
that
our
best
chance
would
be
to
roll
over
in
our
until
we
were
lying
on
the
openings
and
get
frozen
and
drifted
in
gradually
the
situation
got
more
desperate
the
distance
between
the
canvas
and
the
sledge
on
which
it
should
have
been
resting
became
greater
and
this
must
have
been
due
to
the
stretching
of
the
canvas
itself
and
the
loss
of
the
snow
blocks
on
the
top
it
was
not
drawing
out
of
the
walls
the
crashes
as
it
dropped
and
banged
out
again
were
louder
there
was
more
snow
coming
through
the
walls
though
all
our
loose
mitts
socks
and
smaller
clothing
were
stuffed
into
the
worst
places
our
pyjama
jackets
were
stuffed
between
the
roof
and
the
rocks
over
the
door
the
rocks
were
lifting
and
shaking
here
till
we
thought
they
would
fall
we
talked
by
shouting
and
long
before
this
one
of
us
proposed
to
try
and
get
the
alpine
rope
lashed
down
over
the
roof
from
outside
but
bowers
said
it
was
an
absolute
impossibility
in
that
wind
you
could
never
ask
men
at
sea
to
try
such
a
thing
he
said
he
was
up
and
out
of
his
bag
continually
stopping
up
holes
pressing
against
bits
of
roof
to
try
and
prevent
the
flapping
and
so
forth
he
was
magnificent
and
then
it
went
birdie
was
over
by
the
door
where
the
canvas
which
was
bent
over
the
lintel
board
was
working
worse
than
anywhere
else
bill
was
practically
out
of
his
bag
pressing
against
some
part
with
a
long
stick
of
some
kind
i
do
know
what
i
was
doing
but
i
was
half
out
of
and
half
in
my
bag
the
top
of
the
door
opened
in
little
slits
and
that
green
willesden
canvas
flapped
into
hundreds
of
little
fragments
in
fewer
seconds
than
it
takes
to
read
this
the
uproar
of
it
all
was
indescribable
even
above
the
savage
thunder
of
that
great
wind
on
the
mountain
came
the
lash
of
the
canvas
as
it
was
whipped
to
little
tiny
strips
the
highest
rocks
which
we
had
built
into
our
walls
fell
upon
us
and
a
sheet
of
drift
came
in
birdie
dived
for
his
and
eventually
got
in
together
with
a
terrible
lot
of
drift
bill
also
but
he
was
better
off
i
was
already
half
into
mine
and
all
right
so
i
turned
to
help
bill
get
into
your
own
he
shouted
and
when
i
continued
to
try
and
help
him
he
leaned
over
until
his
mouth
was
against
my
ear
cherry
he
said
and
his
voice
was
terribly
anxious
i
know
he
felt
responsible
feared
it
was
he
who
had
brought
us
to
this
ghastly
end
the
next
i
knew
was
bowers
head
across
bill
body
we
all
right
he
yelled
and
we
answered
in
the
affirmative
despite
the
fact
that
we
knew
we
only
said
so
because
we
knew
we
were
all
wrong
this
statement
was
helpful
then
we
turned
our
bags
over
as
far
as
possible
so
that
the
bottom
of
the
bag
was
uppermost
and
the
flaps
were
more
or
less
beneath
us
and
we
lay
and
thought
and
sometimes
we
sang
i
suppose
wrote
wilson
we
were
all
revolving
plans
to
get
back
without
a
tent
and
the
one
thing
we
had
left
was
the
upon
which
we
were
actually
lying
of
course
we
could
not
speak
at
present
but
later
after
the
blizzard
had
stopped
we
discussed
the
possibility
of
digging
a
hole
in
the
snow
each
night
and
covering
it
over
with
the
i
do
not
think
we
had
any
idea
that
we
could
really
get
back
in
those
temperatures
in
our
present
state
of
ice
by
such
means
but
no
one
ever
hinted
at
such
a
thing
birdie
and
bill
sang
quite
a
lot
of
songs
and
hymns
snatches
of
which
reached
me
every
now
and
then
and
i
chimed
in
somewhat
feebly
i
suspect
of
course
we
were
getting
pretty
badly
drifted
up
i
was
resolved
to
keep
warm
wrote
bowers
and
beneath
my
debris
covering
i
paddled
my
feet
and
sang
all
the
songs
and
hymns
i
knew
to
pass
the
time
i
could
occasionally
thump
bill
and
as
he
still
moved
i
knew
he
was
alive
all
right
what
a
birthday
for
him
birdie
was
more
drifted
up
than
we
but
at
times
we
all
had
to
hummock
ourselves
up
to
heave
the
snow
off
our
bags
by
opening
the
flaps
of
our
bags
we
could
get
small
pinches
of
soft
drift
which
we
pressed
together
and
put
into
our
mouths
to
melt
when
our
hands
warmed
up
again
we
got
some
more
so
we
did
not
get
very
thirsty
a
few
ribbons
of
canvas
still
remained
in
the
wall
over
our
heads
and
these
produced
volleys
of
cracks
like
pistol
shots
hour
after
hour
the
canvas
never
drew
out
from
the
walls
not
an
inch
the
wind
made
just
the
same
noise
as
an
express
train
running
fast
through
a
tunnel
if
you
have
both
the
windows
down
i
can
well
believe
that
neither
of
my
companions
gave
up
hope
for
an
instant
they
must
have
been
frightened
but
they
were
never
disturbed
as
for
me
i
never
had
any
hope
at
all
and
when
the
roof
went
i
felt
that
this
was
the
end
what
else
could
i
think
we
had
spent
days
in
reaching
this
place
through
the
darkness
in
cold
such
as
had
never
been
experienced
by
human
beings
we
had
been
out
for
four
weeks
under
conditions
in
which
no
man
had
existed
previously
for
more
than
a
few
days
if
that
during
this
time
we
had
seldom
slept
except
from
sheer
physical
exhaustion
as
men
sleep
on
the
rack
and
every
minute
of
it
we
had
been
fighting
for
the
necessaries
of
bare
existence
and
always
in
the
dark
we
had
kept
ourselves
going
by
enormous
care
of
our
feet
and
hands
and
bodies
by
burning
oil
and
by
having
plenty
of
hot
fatty
food
now
we
had
no
tent
one
tin
of
oil
left
out
of
six
and
only
part
of
our
cooker
when
we
were
lucky
and
not
too
cold
we
could
almost
wring
water
from
our
clothes
and
directly
we
got
out
of
our
we
were
frozen
into
solid
sheets
of
armoured
ice
in
cold
temperatures
with
all
the
advantages
of
a
tent
over
our
heads
we
were
already
taking
more
than
an
hour
of
fierce
struggling
and
cramp
to
get
into
our
so
frozen
were
they
and
so
long
did
it
take
us
to
thaw
our
way
in
no
without
the
tent
we
were
dead
men
illustration
mt
erebus
illustration
ice
pressure
at
a
and
there
seemed
not
one
chance
in
a
million
that
we
should
ever
see
our
tent
again
we
were
feet
up
on
the
mountain
side
and
the
wind
blew
about
as
hard
as
a
wind
can
blow
straight
out
to
sea
first
there
was
a
steep
slope
so
hard
that
a
pick
made
little
impression
upon
it
so
slippery
that
if
you
started
down
in
finnesko
you
never
could
stop
this
ended
in
a
great
some
hundreds
of
feet
high
and
then
came
miles
of
pressure
ridges
crevassed
and
tumbled
in
which
you
might
as
well
look
for
a
daisy
as
a
tent
and
after
that
the
open
sea
the
chances
however
were
that
the
tent
had
just
been
taken
up
into
the
air
and
dropped
somewhere
in
this
sea
well
on
the
way
to
new
zealand
obviously
the
tent
was
gone
face
to
face
with
real
death
one
does
not
think
of
the
things
that
torment
the
bad
people
in
the
tracts
and
fill
the
good
people
with
bliss
i
might
have
speculated
on
my
chances
of
going
to
heaven
but
candidly
i
did
not
care
i
could
not
have
wept
if
i
had
tried
i
had
no
wish
to
review
the
evils
of
my
past
but
the
past
did
seem
to
have
been
a
bit
wasted
the
road
to
hell
may
be
paved
with
good
intentions
the
road
to
heaven
is
paved
with
lost
opportunities
i
wanted
those
years
over
again
what
fun
i
would
have
with
them
what
glorious
fun
it
was
a
pity
well
has
the
persian
said
that
when
we
come
to
die
we
remembering
that
god
is
merciful
will
gnaw
our
elbows
with
remorse
for
thinking
of
the
things
we
have
not
done
for
fear
of
the
day
of
judgment
and
i
wanted
peaches
and
syrup
badly
we
had
them
at
the
hut
sweeter
and
more
luscious
than
you
can
imagine
and
we
had
been
without
sugar
for
a
month
yes
especially
the
syrup
thus
impiously
i
set
out
to
die
making
up
my
mind
that
i
was
not
going
to
try
and
keep
warm
that
it
might
not
take
too
long
and
thinking
i
would
try
and
get
some
morphia
from
the
medical
case
if
it
got
very
bad
not
a
bit
heroic
and
entirely
true
yes
comfortable
warm
reader
men
do
not
fear
death
they
fear
the
pain
of
dying
and
then
quite
naturally
and
no
doubt
disappointingly
to
those
who
would
like
to
read
of
my
last
agonies
for
who
would
not
give
pleasure
by
his
death
i
fell
asleep
i
expect
the
temperature
was
pretty
high
during
this
great
blizzard
and
anything
near
zero
was
very
high
to
us
that
and
the
snow
which
drifted
over
us
made
a
pleasant
wet
kind
of
snipe
marsh
inside
our
and
i
am
sure
we
all
dozed
a
good
bit
there
was
so
much
to
worry
about
that
there
was
not
the
least
use
in
worrying
and
we
were
so
tired
we
were
hungry
for
the
last
meal
we
had
had
was
in
the
morning
of
the
day
before
but
hunger
was
not
very
pressing
and
so
we
lay
wet
and
quite
fairly
warm
hour
after
hour
while
the
wind
roared
round
us
blowing
storm
force
continually
and
rising
in
the
gusts
to
something
indescribable
storm
force
is
force
and
force
is
the
biggest
wind
which
can
be
logged
bowers
logged
it
force
but
he
was
always
so
afraid
of
overestimating
that
he
was
inclined
to
underrate
i
think
it
was
blowing
a
full
hurricane
sometimes
awake
sometimes
dozing
we
had
not
a
very
uncomfortable
time
so
far
as
i
can
remember
i
knew
that
parties
which
had
come
to
cape
crozier
in
the
spring
had
experienced
blizzards
which
lasted
eight
or
ten
days
but
this
did
not
worry
us
as
much
as
i
think
it
did
bill
i
was
numb
i
vaguely
called
to
mind
that
peary
had
survived
a
blizzard
in
the
open
but
was
that
in
the
summer
it
was
in
the
early
morning
of
saturday
july
that
we
discovered
the
loss
of
the
tent
some
time
during
that
morning
we
had
had
our
last
meal
the
roof
went
about
noon
on
sunday
and
we
had
had
no
meal
in
the
interval
because
our
supply
of
oil
was
so
low
nor
could
we
move
out
of
our
bags
except
as
a
last
necessity
by
sunday
night
we
had
been
without
a
meal
for
some
hours
the
rocks
which
fell
upon
us
when
the
roof
went
did
no
damage
and
though
we
could
not
get
out
of
our
bags
to
move
them
we
could
fit
ourselves
into
them
without
difficulty
more
serious
was
the
drift
which
began
to
pile
up
all
round
and
over
us
it
helped
to
keep
us
warm
of
course
but
at
the
same
time
in
these
comparatively
high
temperatures
it
saturated
our
bags
even
worse
than
they
were
before
if
we
did
not
find
the
tent
and
its
recovery
would
be
a
miracle
these
bags
and
the
of
the
tent
on
which
we
were
lying
were
all
we
had
in
that
fight
back
across
the
barrier
which
could
i
suppose
have
only
had
one
end
meanwhile
we
had
to
wait
it
was
nearly
miles
home
and
it
had
taken
us
the
best
part
of
three
weeks
to
come
in
our
less
miserable
moments
we
tried
to
think
out
ways
of
getting
back
but
i
do
not
remember
very
much
about
that
time
sunday
morning
faded
into
sunday
afternoon
into
sunday
night
into
monday
morning
till
then
the
blizzard
had
raged
with
monstrous
fury
the
winds
of
the
world
were
there
and
they
had
all
gone
mad
we
had
bad
winds
at
cape
evans
this
year
and
we
had
far
worse
the
next
winter
when
the
open
water
was
at
our
doors
but
i
have
never
heard
or
felt
or
seen
a
wind
like
this
i
wondered
why
it
did
not
carry
away
the
earth
in
the
early
hours
of
monday
there
was
an
occasional
hint
of
a
lull
ordinarily
in
a
big
winter
blizzard
when
you
have
lived
for
several
days
and
nights
with
that
turmoil
in
your
ears
the
lulls
are
more
trying
than
the
noise
the
feel
of
not
to
feel
it
i
do
not
remember
noticing
that
now
seven
or
eight
more
hours
passed
and
though
it
was
still
blowing
we
could
make
ourselves
heard
to
one
another
without
great
difficulty
it
was
two
days
and
two
nights
since
we
had
had
a
meal
we
decided
to
get
out
of
our
bags
and
make
a
search
for
the
tent
we
did
so
bitterly
cold
and
utterly
miserable
though
i
do
not
think
any
of
us
showed
it
in
the
darkness
we
could
see
very
little
and
no
trace
whatever
of
the
tent
we
returned
against
the
wind
nursing
our
faces
and
hands
and
settled
that
we
must
try
and
cook
a
meal
somehow
we
managed
about
the
weirdest
meal
eaten
north
or
south
we
got
the
wedged
under
our
bags
then
got
into
our
bags
and
drew
the
over
our
heads
between
us
we
got
the
primus
alight
somehow
and
by
hand
we
balanced
the
cooker
on
top
of
it
minus
the
two
members
which
had
been
blown
away
the
flame
flickered
in
the
draughts
very
slowly
the
snow
in
the
cooker
melted
we
threw
in
a
plentiful
supply
of
pemmican
and
the
smell
of
it
was
better
than
anything
on
earth
in
time
we
got
both
tea
and
pemmican
which
was
full
of
hairs
from
our
bags
penguin
feathers
dirt
and
debris
but
delicious
the
blubber
left
in
the
cooker
got
burnt
and
gave
the
tea
a
burnt
taste
none
of
us
ever
forgot
that
meal
i
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
such
a
meal
could
be
enjoyed
and
that
burnt
taste
will
always
bring
back
the
memory
it
was
still
dark
and
we
lay
down
in
our
bags
again
but
soon
a
little
glow
of
light
began
to
come
up
and
we
turned
out
to
have
a
further
search
for
the
tent
birdie
went
off
before
bill
and
me
clumsily
i
dragged
my
out
of
my
bag
on
my
feet
all
sopping
wet
it
was
impossible
to
get
it
back
and
i
let
it
freeze
it
was
soon
just
like
a
rock
the
sky
to
the
south
was
as
black
and
sinister
as
it
could
possibly
be
it
looked
as
though
the
blizzard
would
be
on
us
again
at
any
moment
i
followed
bill
down
the
slope
we
could
find
nothing
but
as
we
searched
we
heard
a
shout
somewhere
below
and
to
the
right
we
got
on
a
slope
slipped
and
went
sliding
down
quite
unable
to
stop
ourselves
and
came
upon
birdie
with
the
tent
the
outer
lining
still
on
the
bamboos
our
lives
had
been
taken
away
and
given
back
to
us
we
were
so
thankful
we
said
nothing
the
tent
must
have
been
gripped
up
into
the
air
shutting
as
it
rose
the
bamboos
with
the
inner
lining
lashed
to
them
had
entangled
the
outer
cover
and
the
whole
went
up
together
like
a
shut
umbrella
this
was
our
salvation
if
it
had
opened
in
the
air
nothing
could
have
prevented
its
destruction
as
it
was
with
all
the
accumulated
ice
upon
it
it
must
have
weighed
the
best
part
of
lbs
it
had
been
dropped
about
half
a
mile
away
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
slope
and
it
fell
in
a
hollow
still
shut
up
the
main
force
of
the
wind
had
passed
over
it
and
there
it
was
with
the
bamboos
and
fastenings
wrenched
and
strained
and
the
ends
of
two
of
the
poles
broken
but
the
silk
untorn
if
that
tent
went
again
we
were
going
with
it
we
made
our
way
back
up
the
slope
with
it
carrying
it
solemnly
and
reverently
precious
as
though
it
were
something
not
quite
of
the
earth
and
we
dug
it
in
as
tent
was
never
dug
in
before
not
by
the
igloo
but
in
the
old
place
farther
down
where
we
had
first
arrived
and
while
bill
was
doing
this
birdie
and
i
went
back
to
the
igloo
and
dug
and
scratched
and
shook
away
the
drift
inside
until
we
had
found
nearly
all
our
gear
it
is
wonderful
how
little
we
lost
when
the
roof
went
most
of
our
gear
was
hung
on
the
sledge
which
was
part
of
the
roof
or
was
packed
into
the
holes
of
the
hut
to
try
and
make
it
and
the
things
must
have
been
blown
inwards
into
the
bottom
of
the
hut
by
the
wind
from
the
south
and
the
back
draught
from
the
north
then
they
were
all
drifted
up
of
course
a
certain
number
of
mitts
and
socks
were
blown
away
and
lost
but
the
only
important
things
were
bill
fur
mitts
which
were
stuffed
into
a
hole
in
the
rocks
of
the
hut
we
loaded
up
the
sledge
and
pushed
it
down
the
slope
i
do
know
how
birdie
was
feeling
but
i
felt
so
weak
that
it
was
the
greatest
labour
the
blizzard
looked
right
on
top
of
us
we
had
another
meal
and
we
wanted
it
and
as
the
good
hoosh
ran
down
into
our
feet
and
hands
and
up
into
our
cheeks
and
ears
and
brains
we
discussed
what
we
would
do
next
birdie
was
all
for
another
go
at
the
emperor
penguins
dear
birdie
he
never
would
admit
that
he
was
beaten
i
do
know
that
he
ever
really
was
i
think
he
wilson
thought
he
had
landed
us
in
a
bad
corner
and
was
determined
to
go
straight
home
though
i
was
for
one
other
tap
at
the
rookery
however
i
had
placed
myself
under
his
orders
for
this
trip
voluntarily
and
so
we
started
the
next
day
for
home
there
could
really
be
no
doubt
we
had
to
go
back
and
we
were
already
very
doubtful
whether
we
should
ever
manage
to
get
into
our
in
very
low
temperature
so
ghastly
had
they
become
i
do
know
when
it
was
but
i
remember
walking
down
that
slope
i
know
why
perhaps
to
try
and
find
the
bottom
of
the
cooker
and
thinking
that
there
was
nothing
on
earth
that
a
man
under
such
circumstances
would
not
give
for
a
good
warm
sleep
he
would
give
everything
he
possessed
he
would
give
how
many
years
of
his
life
one
or
two
at
any
rate
perhaps
five
yes
i
would
give
five
i
remember
the
sastrugi
the
view
of
the
knoll
the
dim
hazy
black
smudge
of
the
sea
far
away
below
the
tiny
bits
of
green
canvas
that
twittered
in
the
wind
on
the
surface
of
the
snow
the
cold
misery
of
it
all
and
the
weakness
which
was
biting
into
my
heart
for
days
birdie
had
been
urging
me
to
use
his
lining
his
beautiful
dry
bag
of
the
finest
down
which
he
had
never
slipped
into
his
own
fur
bag
i
had
refused
i
felt
that
i
should
be
a
beast
to
take
it
we
packed
the
tank
ready
for
a
start
back
in
the
morning
and
turned
in
utterly
worn
out
it
was
only
that
night
but
my
left
big
toe
was
in
my
bag
which
i
was
trying
to
use
without
an
lining
and
my
bag
was
always
too
big
for
me
it
must
have
taken
several
hours
to
get
it
back
by
beating
one
foot
against
the
other
when
we
got
up
as
soon
as
we
could
as
we
did
every
night
for
our
bags
were
nearly
impossible
it
was
blowing
fairly
hard
and
looked
like
blizzing
we
had
a
lot
to
do
two
or
three
hours
work
packing
sledges
and
making
a
depôt
of
what
we
did
not
want
in
a
corner
of
the
igloo
we
left
the
second
sledge
and
a
note
tied
to
the
handle
of
the
pickaxe
we
started
down
the
slope
in
a
wind
which
was
rising
all
the
time
and
my
job
was
to
balance
the
sledge
behind
i
was
so
utterly
done
i
do
believe
i
could
have
pulled
effectively
birdie
was
much
the
strongest
of
us
the
strain
and
want
of
sleep
was
getting
me
in
the
neck
and
bill
looked
very
bad
at
the
bottom
we
turned
our
faces
to
the
barrier
our
backs
to
the
penguins
but
after
doing
about
a
mile
it
looked
so
threatening
in
the
south
that
we
camped
in
a
big
wind
our
hands
going
one
after
the
other
we
had
nothing
but
the
hardest
sastrugi
and
it
was
a
long
business
there
was
only
the
smallest
amount
of
drift
and
we
were
afraid
the
icy
snow
blocks
would
chafe
the
tent
birdie
lashed
the
full
biscuit
tin
to
the
door
to
prevent
its
flapping
and
also
got
what
he
called
the
tent
downhaul
round
the
cap
and
then
tied
it
about
himself
outside
his
bag
if
the
tent
went
he
was
going
too
i
was
feeling
as
if
i
should
crack
and
accepted
birdie
it
was
wonderfully
of
him
more
than
i
can
write
i
felt
a
brute
to
take
it
but
i
was
getting
useless
unless
i
got
some
sleep
which
my
big
bag
would
not
allow
bill
and
birdie
kept
on
telling
me
to
do
less
that
i
was
doing
more
than
my
share
of
the
work
but
i
think
that
i
was
getting
more
and
more
weak
birdie
kept
wonderfully
strong
he
slept
most
of
the
night
the
difficulty
for
him
was
to
get
into
his
bag
without
going
to
sleep
he
kept
the
meteorological
log
untiringly
but
some
of
these
nights
he
had
to
give
it
up
for
the
time
because
he
could
not
keep
awake
he
used
to
fall
asleep
with
his
pannikin
in
his
hand
and
let
it
fall
and
sometimes
he
had
the
primus
bill
bag
was
getting
hopeless
it
was
really
too
small
for
an
and
was
splitting
all
over
the
place
great
long
holes
he
never
consciously
slept
for
nights
he
did
sleep
a
bit
for
we
heard
him
except
for
this
night
and
the
next
when
birdie
was
still
fairly
dry
i
never
consciously
slept
except
that
i
used
to
wake
for
five
or
six
nights
running
with
the
same
nightmare
that
we
were
drifted
up
and
that
bill
and
birdie
were
passing
the
gear
into
my
bag
cutting
it
open
to
do
so
or
some
other
variation
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
been
asleep
at
all
we
had
hardly
reached
the
pit
wrote
bowers
when
a
furious
wind
came
on
again
and
we
had
to
camp
all
that
night
the
tent
flapped
like
the
noise
of
musketry
owing
to
two
poles
having
been
broken
at
the
ends
and
the
fit
spoilt
i
thought
it
would
end
matters
by
going
altogether
and
lashed
it
down
as
much
as
i
could
attaching
the
apex
to
a
line
round
my
own
bag
the
wind
abated
after
days
and
we
set
out
doing
five
or
six
miles
before
we
found
ourselves
among
crevasses
we
had
plugged
ahead
all
that
day
july
in
a
terrible
light
blundering
in
among
pressure
and
up
on
to
the
slopes
of
terror
the
temperature
dropped
from
to
several
times
we
stepped
into
crevasses
in
smooth
ice
we
continued
however
feeling
our
way
along
by
keeping
always
off
hard
and
on
the
crustier
deeper
snow
which
characterizes
the
hollows
of
the
pressure
ridges
which
i
believed
we
had
once
more
fouled
in
the
dark
we
had
no
light
and
no
landmarks
to
guide
us
except
vague
and
indistinct
silhouetted
slopes
ahead
which
were
always
altering
and
whose
distance
and
character
it
was
impossible
to
judge
we
never
knew
whether
we
were
approaching
a
steep
slope
at
close
quarters
or
a
long
slope
of
terror
miles
away
and
eventually
we
travelled
on
by
the
ear
and
by
the
feel
of
the
snow
under
our
feet
for
both
the
sound
and
the
touch
told
one
much
of
the
chances
of
crevasses
or
of
safe
going
we
continued
thus
in
the
dark
in
the
hope
that
we
were
at
any
rate
in
the
right
direction
and
then
we
camped
after
getting
into
a
bunch
of
crevasses
completely
lost
bill
said
at
any
rate
i
think
we
are
well
clear
of
the
pressure
but
there
were
pressure
pops
all
night
as
though
some
one
was
whacking
an
empty
tub
it
was
birdie
picture
hat
which
made
the
trouble
next
day
what
do
you
think
of
for
a
hat
sir
i
heard
him
say
to
scott
a
few
days
before
we
started
holding
it
out
much
as
lucille
displays
her
latest
paris
model
scott
looked
at
it
quietly
for
a
time
i
tell
you
when
you
come
back
birdie
he
said
it
was
a
complicated
affair
with
all
kinds
of
and
buttons
and
lanyards
he
thought
he
was
going
to
set
it
to
suit
the
wind
much
as
he
would
set
the
sails
of
a
ship
we
spent
a
long
time
with
our
housewifes
before
this
and
other
trips
for
everybody
has
their
own
ideas
as
to
how
to
alter
their
clothing
for
the
best
when
finished
some
looked
neat
like
bill
others
baggy
like
scott
or
seaman
evans
others
rough
and
ready
like
oates
and
bowers
a
few
perhaps
more
rough
than
ready
and
i
will
not
mention
names
anyway
birdie
hat
became
improper
immediately
it
was
well
iced
up
when
we
got
a
little
light
in
the
morning
we
found
we
were
a
little
north
of
the
two
patches
of
moraine
on
terror
though
we
did
not
know
it
we
were
on
the
point
where
the
pressure
runs
up
against
terror
and
we
could
dimly
see
that
we
were
right
up
against
something
we
started
to
try
and
clear
it
but
soon
had
an
enormous
ridge
blotting
out
the
moraine
and
half
terror
rising
like
a
great
hill
on
our
right
bill
said
the
only
thing
was
to
go
right
on
and
hope
it
would
lower
all
the
time
however
there
was
a
bad
feeling
that
we
might
be
putting
any
number
of
ridges
between
us
and
the
mountain
after
a
while
we
tried
to
cross
this
one
but
had
to
turn
back
for
crevasses
both
bill
and
i
putting
a
leg
down
we
went
on
for
about
twenty
minutes
and
found
a
lower
place
and
turned
to
rise
up
it
diagonally
and
reached
the
top
just
over
the
top
birdie
went
right
down
a
crevasse
which
was
about
wide
enough
to
take
him
he
was
out
of
sight
and
out
of
reach
from
the
surface
hanging
in
his
harness
bill
went
for
his
harness
i
went
for
the
bow
of
the
sledge
bill
told
me
to
get
the
alpine
rope
and
birdie
directed
from
below
what
we
could
do
we
could
not
possibly
haul
him
up
as
he
was
for
the
sides
of
the
crevasse
were
soft
and
he
could
not
help
himself
my
helmet
was
so
frozen
up
wrote
bowers
that
my
head
was
encased
in
a
solid
block
of
ice
and
i
could
not
look
down
without
inclining
my
whole
body
as
a
result
bill
stumbled
one
foot
into
a
crevasse
and
i
landed
in
it
with
both
mine
even
as
i
shouted
a
warning
the
bridge
gave
way
and
down
i
went
fortunately
our
sledge
harness
is
made
with
a
view
to
resisting
this
sort
of
thing
and
there
i
hung
with
the
bottomless
pit
below
and
the
sides
alongside
so
narrow
that
to
step
over
it
would
have
been
quite
easy
had
i
been
able
to
see
it
bill
said
do
you
want
i
asked
for
an
alpine
rope
with
a
bowline
for
my
foot
and
taking
up
first
the
bowline
and
then
my
harness
they
got
me
out
meanwhile
on
the
surface
i
lay
over
the
crevasse
and
gave
birdie
the
bowline
he
put
it
on
his
foot
then
he
raised
his
foot
giving
me
some
slack
i
held
the
rope
while
he
raised
himself
on
his
foot
thus
giving
bill
some
slack
on
the
harness
bill
then
held
the
harness
allowing
birdie
to
raise
his
foot
and
give
me
some
slack
again
we
got
him
up
inch
by
inch
our
fingers
getting
bitten
for
the
temperature
was
afterwards
we
often
used
this
way
of
getting
people
out
of
crevasses
and
it
was
a
wonderful
piece
of
presence
of
mind
that
it
was
invented
so
far
as
i
know
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
by
a
frozen
man
hanging
in
one
himself
in
front
of
us
we
could
see
another
ridge
and
we
did
not
know
how
many
lay
beyond
that
things
looked
pretty
bad
bill
took
a
long
lead
on
the
alpine
rope
and
we
got
down
our
present
difficulty
all
right
this
method
of
the
leader
being
on
a
long
trace
in
front
we
all
agreed
to
be
very
useful
from
this
moment
our
luck
changed
and
everything
went
for
us
to
the
end
when
we
went
out
on
the
the
whole
experience
was
over
in
a
few
days
hut
point
was
always
in
sight
and
there
was
daylight
i
always
had
the
feeling
that
the
whole
series
of
events
had
been
brought
about
by
an
extraordinary
run
of
accidents
and
that
after
a
certain
stage
it
was
quite
beyond
our
power
to
guide
the
course
of
them
when
on
the
way
to
cape
crozier
the
moon
suddenly
came
out
of
the
cloud
to
show
us
a
great
crevasse
which
would
have
taken
us
all
with
our
sledge
without
any
difficulty
i
felt
that
we
were
not
to
go
under
this
trip
after
such
a
deliverance
when
we
had
lost
our
tent
and
there
was
a
very
great
balance
of
probability
that
we
should
never
find
it
again
and
we
were
lying
out
the
blizzard
in
our
bags
i
saw
that
we
were
face
to
face
with
a
long
fight
against
cold
which
we
could
not
have
survived
i
can
not
write
how
helpless
i
believed
we
were
to
help
ourselves
and
how
we
were
brought
out
of
a
very
terrible
series
of
experiences
when
we
started
back
i
had
a
feeling
that
things
were
going
to
change
for
the
better
and
this
day
i
had
a
distinct
idea
that
we
were
to
have
one
more
bad
experience
and
that
after
that
we
could
hope
for
better
things
illustration
down
a
crevasse
by
running
along
the
hollow
we
cleared
the
pressure
ridges
and
continued
all
day
up
and
down
but
met
no
crevasses
indeed
we
met
no
more
crevasses
and
no
more
pressure
i
think
it
was
upon
this
day
that
a
wonderful
glow
stretched
over
the
barrier
edge
from
cape
crozier
at
the
base
it
was
the
most
vivid
crimson
it
is
possible
to
imagine
shading
upwards
through
every
shade
of
red
to
light
green
and
so
into
a
deep
blue
sky
it
is
the
most
vivid
red
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
sky
it
was
in
the
night
and
we
were
away
early
in
by
we
were
rising
terror
point
opening
erebus
rapidly
and
got
the
first
really
light
day
though
the
sun
would
not
appear
over
the
horizon
for
another
month
i
can
not
describe
what
a
relief
the
light
was
to
us
we
crossed
the
point
outside
our
former
track
and
saw
inside
us
the
ridges
where
we
had
been
blizzed
for
three
days
on
our
outward
journey
the
minimum
was
the
next
night
and
we
were
now
back
in
the
windless
bight
of
barrier
with
its
soft
snow
low
temperatures
fogs
and
mists
and
lingering
settlements
of
the
inside
crusts
saturday
and
sunday
the
and
we
plugged
on
across
this
waste
iced
up
as
usual
but
always
with
castle
rock
getting
bigger
sometimes
it
looked
like
fog
or
wind
but
it
always
cleared
away
we
were
getting
weak
how
weak
we
can
only
realize
now
but
we
got
in
good
marches
though
slow
days
when
we
did
miles
on
our
outward
journey
we
had
been
relaying
and
getting
forward
about
miles
a
day
at
this
point
the
surface
which
we
had
dreaded
so
much
was
not
so
sandy
or
soft
as
when
we
had
come
out
and
the
settlements
were
more
marked
these
are
caused
by
a
crust
falling
under
your
feet
generally
the
area
involved
is
some
twenty
yards
or
so
round
you
and
the
surface
falls
through
an
air
space
for
two
or
three
inches
with
a
soft
which
may
at
first
make
you
think
there
are
crevasses
about
in
the
region
where
we
now
travelled
they
were
much
more
pronounced
than
elsewhere
and
one
day
when
bill
was
inside
the
tent
lighting
the
primus
i
put
my
foot
into
a
hole
that
i
had
dug
this
started
a
big
settlement
sledge
tent
and
all
of
us
dropped
about
a
foot
and
the
noise
of
it
ran
away
for
miles
and
miles
we
listened
to
it
until
we
began
to
get
too
cold
it
must
have
lasted
a
full
three
minutes
in
the
pauses
of
our
marching
we
halted
in
our
harnesses
the
ropes
of
which
lay
slack
in
the
powdery
snow
we
stood
panting
with
our
backs
against
the
mountainous
mass
of
frozen
gear
which
was
our
load
there
was
no
wind
at
any
rate
no
more
than
light
airs
our
breath
crackled
as
it
froze
there
was
no
unnecessary
conversation
i
do
know
why
our
tongues
never
got
frozen
but
all
my
teeth
the
nerves
of
which
had
been
killed
split
to
pieces
we
had
been
going
perhaps
three
hours
since
lunch
how
are
your
feet
cherry
from
bill
very
cold
that
all
right
so
are
mine
we
did
worry
to
ask
birdie
he
never
had
a
foot
from
start
to
finish
half
an
hour
later
as
we
marched
bill
would
ask
the
same
question
i
tell
him
that
all
feeling
has
gone
bill
still
has
some
feeling
in
one
of
his
but
the
other
is
lost
he
settled
we
had
better
camp
another
ghastly
night
ahead
we
started
to
get
out
of
our
harnesses
while
bill
before
doing
anything
else
would
take
the
fur
mitts
from
his
hands
carefully
shape
any
soft
parts
as
they
froze
generally
however
our
mitts
did
not
thaw
on
our
hands
and
lay
them
on
the
snow
in
front
of
him
two
dark
dots
his
proper
fur
mitts
were
lost
when
the
igloo
roof
went
these
were
the
delicate
linings
we
had
in
addition
beautiful
things
to
look
at
and
to
feel
when
new
excellent
when
dry
to
turn
the
screws
of
a
theodolite
but
too
dainty
for
straps
and
lanyards
just
now
i
do
know
what
he
could
have
done
without
them
working
with
our
woollen
and
mitts
on
our
hands
all
the
time
and
our
fur
mitts
over
them
when
possible
we
gradually
got
the
buckles
undone
and
spread
the
green
canvas
on
the
snow
this
was
also
fitted
to
be
used
as
a
sail
but
we
never
could
have
rigged
a
sail
on
this
journey
the
shovel
and
the
bamboos
with
a
lining
itself
lined
with
ice
lashed
to
them
were
packed
on
the
top
of
the
load
and
were
now
put
on
the
snow
until
wanted
our
next
job
was
to
lift
our
three
one
by
one
on
to
the
they
covered
it
bulging
over
the
sides
those
obstinate
coffins
which
were
all
our
life
to
us
one
of
us
is
off
by
now
to
nurse
his
fingers
back
the
cooker
was
unlashed
from
the
top
of
the
instrument
box
some
parts
of
it
were
put
on
the
bags
with
the
primus
methylated
spirit
can
matches
and
so
forth
others
left
to
be
filled
with
snow
later
taking
a
pole
in
each
hand
we
three
spread
the
bamboos
over
the
whole
all
right
down
from
bill
and
we
lowered
them
gently
on
to
the
soft
snow
that
they
might
not
sink
too
far
the
ice
on
the
inner
lining
of
the
tent
was
formed
mostly
from
the
steam
of
the
cooker
this
we
had
been
unable
to
beat
or
chip
off
in
the
past
and
we
were
now
truth
to
tell
past
worrying
about
it
the
little
ventilator
in
the
top
made
to
let
out
this
steam
had
been
tied
up
in
order
to
keep
in
all
possible
heat
then
over
with
the
outer
cover
and
for
one
of
us
the
third
worst
job
of
the
day
was
to
begin
the
worst
job
was
to
get
into
our
bags
the
second
or
equal
worst
was
to
lie
in
them
for
six
hours
we
had
brought
it
down
to
six
this
third
worst
was
to
get
the
primus
lighted
and
a
meal
on
the
way
as
cook
of
the
day
you
took
the
broken
metal
framework
all
that
remained
of
our
candlestick
and
got
yourself
with
difficulty
into
the
funnel
which
formed
the
door
the
enclosed
space
of
the
tent
seemed
much
colder
than
the
outside
air
you
tried
three
or
four
and
no
match
would
strike
almost
desperate
you
asked
for
a
new
box
to
be
given
you
from
the
sledge
and
got
a
light
from
this
because
it
had
not
yet
been
in
the
warmth
so
called
of
the
tent
the
candle
hung
by
a
wire
from
the
cap
of
the
tent
it
would
be
tedious
to
tell
of
the
times
we
had
getting
the
primus
alight
and
the
lanyards
of
the
weekly
food
bag
unlashed
probably
by
now
the
other
two
men
have
dug
in
the
tent
squared
up
outside
filled
and
passed
in
the
cooker
set
the
thermometer
under
the
sledge
and
so
forth
there
were
always
one
or
two
odd
jobs
which
wanted
doing
as
well
but
you
may
be
sure
they
came
in
as
soon
as
possible
when
they
heard
the
primus
hissing
and
saw
the
glow
of
light
inside
birdie
made
a
bottom
for
the
cooker
out
of
an
empty
biscuit
tin
to
take
the
place
of
the
part
which
was
blown
away
on
the
whole
this
was
a
success
but
we
had
to
hold
it
steady
on
bill
for
the
flat
frozen
bags
spread
all
over
the
floor
space
cooking
was
a
longer
business
now
some
one
whacked
out
the
biscuit
and
the
cook
put
the
ration
of
pemmican
into
the
inner
cooker
which
was
by
now
half
full
of
water
as
opportunity
offered
we
got
out
of
our
day
and
into
our
night
fleecy
stockings
and
fur
boots
in
the
dim
light
we
examined
our
feet
for
i
do
not
think
it
took
us
less
than
an
hour
to
get
a
hot
meal
to
our
lips
pemmican
followed
by
hot
water
in
which
we
soaked
our
biscuits
for
lunch
we
had
tea
and
biscuits
for
breakfast
pemmican
biscuits
and
tea
we
could
not
have
managed
more
food
bags
three
were
bad
enough
and
the
lashings
of
everything
were
like
wire
the
lashing
of
the
tent
door
however
was
the
worst
and
it
to
be
tied
tightly
especially
if
it
was
blowing
in
the
early
days
we
took
great
pains
to
brush
rime
from
the
tent
before
packing
it
up
but
we
were
long
past
that
now
the
hoosh
got
down
into
our
feet
we
nursed
back
and
we
were
all
the
warmer
for
having
got
our
dry
on
before
supper
then
we
started
to
get
into
our
bags
illustration
panorama
and
map
of
the
winter
journey
copied
at
hut
point
by
apsley
from
a
drawing
by
wilson
birdie
bag
fitted
him
beautifully
though
perhaps
it
would
have
been
a
little
small
with
an
inside
he
must
have
had
a
greater
heat
supply
than
other
men
for
he
never
had
serious
trouble
with
his
feet
while
ours
were
constantly
he
slept
i
should
be
afraid
to
say
how
much
longer
than
we
did
even
in
these
last
days
it
was
a
pleasure
lying
awake
practically
all
night
to
hear
his
snores
he
turned
his
bag
inside
out
from
fur
to
skin
and
skin
to
fur
many
times
during
the
journey
and
thus
got
rid
of
a
lot
of
moisture
which
came
out
as
snow
or
actual
knobs
of
ice
when
we
did
turn
our
bags
the
only
way
was
to
do
so
directly
we
turned
out
and
even
then
you
had
to
be
quick
before
the
bag
froze
getting
out
of
the
tent
at
night
it
was
quite
a
race
to
get
back
to
your
bag
before
it
hardened
of
course
this
was
in
the
lowest
temperatures
we
could
not
burn
our
bags
and
we
tried
putting
the
lighted
primus
into
them
to
thaw
them
out
but
this
was
not
very
successful
before
this
time
when
it
was
very
cold
we
lighted
the
primus
in
the
morning
while
we
were
still
in
our
bags
and
in
the
evening
we
kept
it
going
until
we
were
just
getting
or
had
got
the
mouths
of
our
bags
levered
open
but
returning
we
had
no
oil
for
such
luxuries
until
the
last
day
or
two
i
do
not
believe
that
any
man
however
sick
he
is
has
a
much
worse
time
than
we
had
in
those
bags
shaking
with
cold
until
our
backs
would
almost
break
one
of
the
added
troubles
which
came
to
us
on
our
return
was
the
sodden
condition
of
our
hands
in
our
bags
at
night
we
had
to
wear
our
mitts
and
and
they
were
as
wet
as
they
could
be
when
we
got
up
in
the
morning
we
had
hands
white
crinkled
sodden
that
was
an
unhealthy
way
to
start
the
day
work
we
really
wanted
some
bags
of
saennegrass
for
hands
as
well
as
feet
one
of
the
blessings
of
that
kind
of
bag
being
that
you
can
shake
the
moisture
from
it
but
we
only
had
enough
for
our
wretched
feet
the
horrors
of
that
return
journey
are
blurred
to
my
memory
and
i
know
they
were
blurred
to
my
body
at
the
time
i
think
this
applies
to
all
of
us
for
we
were
much
weakened
and
callous
the
day
we
got
down
to
the
penguins
i
had
not
cared
whether
i
fell
into
a
crevasse
or
not
we
had
been
through
a
great
deal
since
then
i
know
that
we
slept
on
the
march
for
i
woke
up
when
i
bumped
against
birdie
and
birdie
woke
when
he
bumped
against
me
i
think
bill
steering
out
in
front
managed
to
keep
awake
i
know
we
fell
asleep
if
we
waited
in
the
comparatively
warm
tent
when
the
primus
was
alight
with
our
pannikins
or
the
primus
in
our
hands
i
know
that
our
were
so
full
of
ice
that
we
did
not
worry
if
we
spilt
water
or
hoosh
over
them
as
they
lay
on
the
when
we
cooked
on
them
with
our
maimed
cooker
they
were
so
bad
that
we
never
rolled
them
up
in
the
usual
way
when
we
got
out
of
them
in
the
morning
we
opened
their
mouths
as
much
as
possible
before
they
froze
and
hoisted
them
more
or
less
flat
on
to
the
sledge
all
three
of
us
helped
to
raise
each
bag
which
looked
rather
like
a
squashed
coffin
and
was
probably
a
good
deal
harder
i
know
that
if
it
was
only
when
we
camped
for
the
night
we
considered
quite
seriously
that
we
were
going
to
have
a
warm
one
and
that
when
we
got
up
in
the
morning
if
the
temperature
was
in
the
minus
sixties
we
did
not
enquire
what
it
was
the
day
march
was
bliss
compared
to
the
night
rest
and
both
were
awful
we
were
about
as
bad
as
men
can
be
and
do
good
travelling
but
i
never
heard
a
word
of
complaint
nor
i
believe
an
oath
and
i
saw
standing
every
test
always
we
were
getting
nearer
home
and
we
were
doing
good
marches
we
were
going
to
pull
through
it
was
only
a
matter
of
sticking
this
for
a
few
more
days
six
five
four
three
perhaps
now
if
we
were
not
blizzed
our
main
hut
was
behind
that
ridge
where
the
mist
was
always
forming
and
blowing
away
and
there
was
castle
rock
we
might
even
see
observation
hill
and
the
discovery
hut
furnished
and
trim
was
behind
it
and
they
would
have
sent
some
dry
from
cape
evans
to
greet
us
there
we
reckoned
our
troubles
over
at
the
barrier
edge
and
assuredly
it
was
not
far
away
you
got
it
in
the
neck
stick
it
you
got
it
in
the
neck
it
was
always
running
in
my
head
and
we
stick
it
how
good
the
memories
of
those
days
are
with
jokes
about
birdie
picture
hat
with
songs
we
remembered
off
the
gramophone
with
ready
words
of
sympathy
for
feet
with
generous
smiles
for
poor
jests
with
suggestions
of
happy
beds
to
come
we
did
not
forget
the
please
and
thank
you
which
mean
much
in
such
circumstances
and
all
the
little
links
with
decent
civilization
which
we
could
still
keep
going
i
swear
there
was
still
a
grace
about
us
when
we
staggered
in
and
we
kept
our
tempers
even
with
god
we
reach
hut
point
we
were
burning
more
oil
now
that
tin
had
lasted
us
well
and
burning
more
candle
too
at
one
time
we
feared
they
would
give
out
a
hell
of
a
morning
we
had
in
our
present
state
but
it
was
calm
and
the
barrier
edge
could
not
be
much
farther
now
the
surface
was
getting
harder
there
were
a
few
furrows
the
crust
was
coming
up
to
us
the
sledge
was
dragging
easier
we
always
suspected
the
barrier
sloped
downwards
hereabouts
now
the
hard
snow
was
on
the
surface
peeping
out
like
great
inverted
basins
on
which
we
slipped
and
our
feet
became
warmer
for
not
sinking
into
soft
snow
suddenly
we
saw
a
gleam
of
light
in
a
line
of
darkness
running
across
our
course
it
was
the
barrier
edge
we
were
all
right
now
we
ran
the
sledge
off
a
on
to
the
with
the
same
cold
stream
of
air
flowing
down
it
which
wrecked
my
hands
five
weeks
ago
pushed
out
of
this
camped
and
had
a
meal
the
temperature
had
already
risen
to
we
could
almost
feel
it
getting
warmer
as
we
went
round
cape
armitage
on
the
last
three
miles
we
managed
to
haul
our
sledge
up
the
ice
foot
and
dug
the
drift
away
from
the
door
the
old
hut
struck
us
as
fairly
warm
bill
was
convinced
that
we
ought
not
to
go
into
the
warm
hut
at
cape
evans
when
we
arrived
there
night
we
ought
to
get
back
to
warmth
gradually
live
in
a
tent
outside
or
in
the
annexe
for
a
day
or
two
but
i
sure
we
never
meant
to
do
it
just
now
hut
point
did
not
prejudice
us
in
favour
of
such
abstinence
it
was
just
as
we
had
left
it
there
was
nothing
sent
down
for
us
there
no
nor
sugar
but
there
was
plenty
of
oil
inside
the
hut
we
pitched
a
dry
tent
left
there
since
depôt
journey
days
set
two
primuses
going
in
it
sat
dozing
on
our
bags
and
drank
cocoa
without
sugar
so
thick
that
next
morning
we
were
gorged
with
it
we
were
very
happy
falling
asleep
between
each
mouthful
and
after
several
hours
discussed
schemes
of
not
getting
into
our
bags
at
all
but
some
one
would
have
to
keep
the
primus
going
to
prevent
and
we
could
not
trust
ourselves
to
keep
awake
bill
and
i
tried
to
sing
a
finally
we
sopped
our
way
into
our
bags
we
only
stuck
three
hours
and
thankfully
turned
out
at
and
were
ready
to
pack
up
when
we
heard
the
wind
come
away
it
was
no
good
so
we
sat
in
our
tent
and
dozed
again
the
wind
dropped
at
we
were
off
at
we
walked
out
into
what
seemed
to
us
a
blaze
of
light
it
was
not
until
the
following
year
that
i
understood
that
a
great
part
of
such
twilight
as
there
is
in
the
latter
part
of
the
winter
was
cut
off
from
us
by
the
mountains
under
which
we
travelled
now
with
nothing
between
us
and
the
northern
horizon
below
which
lay
the
sun
we
saw
as
we
had
not
seen
for
months
and
the
iridescent
clouds
that
day
were
beautiful
we
just
pulled
for
all
we
were
worth
and
did
nearly
two
miles
an
hour
for
two
miles
a
baddish
salt
surface
then
big
undulating
hard
sastrugi
and
good
going
we
slept
as
we
walked
we
had
done
eight
miles
by
and
were
past
glacier
tongue
we
lunched
there
as
we
began
to
gather
our
gear
together
to
pack
up
for
the
last
time
bill
said
quietly
i
want
to
thank
you
two
for
what
you
have
done
i
could
have
found
two
better
companions
and
what
is
more
i
never
shall
i
am
proud
of
that
antarctic
exploration
is
seldom
as
bad
as
you
imagine
seldom
as
bad
as
it
sounds
but
this
journey
had
beggared
our
language
no
words
could
express
its
horror
we
trudged
on
for
several
more
hours
and
it
grew
very
dark
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
where
cape
evans
lay
we
rounded
it
at
last
it
must
have
been
ten
or
eleven
and
it
was
possible
that
some
one
might
see
us
as
we
pulled
towards
the
hut
spread
out
well
said
bill
and
they
will
be
able
to
see
that
there
are
three
men
but
we
pulled
along
the
cape
over
the
up
the
bank
to
the
very
door
of
the
hut
without
a
sound
no
noise
from
the
stable
nor
the
bark
of
a
dog
from
the
snowdrifts
above
us
we
halted
and
stood
there
trying
to
get
ourselves
and
one
another
out
of
our
frozen
harnesses
the
usual
long
job
the
door
opened
good
god
here
is
the
crozier
party
said
a
voice
and
disappeared
thus
ended
the
worst
journey
in
the
world
and
now
the
reader
will
ask
what
became
of
the
three
penguins
eggs
for
which
three
human
lives
had
been
risked
three
hundred
times
a
day
and
three
human
frames
strained
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
human
endurance
let
us
leave
the
antarctic
for
a
moment
and
conceive
ourselves
in
the
year
in
the
natural
history
museum
in
south
kensington
i
had
written
to
say
that
i
would
bring
the
eggs
at
this
time
present
myself
the
sole
survivor
of
the
three
with
first
or
doorstep
custodian
of
the
sacred
eggs
i
did
not
take
a
verbatim
report
of
his
welcome
but
the
spirit
of
it
may
be
dramatized
as
follows
first
custodian
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
this
ai
an
what
call
have
you
to
come
meddling
with
our
eggs
do
you
want
me
to
put
the
police
on
to
you
is
it
the
crocodile
egg
you
after
i
know
nothing
about
eggs
you
best
speak
to
brown
it
him
that
varnishes
the
eggs
i
resort
to
brown
who
ushers
me
into
the
presence
of
the
chief
custodian
a
man
of
scientific
aspect
with
two
manners
one
affably
courteous
for
a
person
of
importance
i
guess
a
naturalist
rothschild
at
least
with
whom
he
is
conversing
and
the
other
extraordinarily
offensive
even
for
an
official
man
of
science
for
myself
i
announce
myself
with
becoming
modesty
as
the
bearer
of
the
eggs
and
proffer
them
the
chief
custodian
takes
them
into
custody
without
a
word
of
thanks
and
turns
to
the
person
of
importance
to
discuss
them
i
wait
the
temperature
of
my
blood
rises
the
conversation
proceeds
for
what
seems
to
me
a
considerable
period
suddenly
the
chief
custodian
notices
my
presence
and
seems
to
resent
it
chief
custodian
you
need
wait
heroic
explorer
i
should
like
to
have
a
receipt
for
the
eggs
if
you
please
chief
custodian
it
is
not
necessary
it
is
all
right
you
need
wait
heroic
explorer
i
should
like
to
have
a
receipt
but
by
this
time
the
chief
custodian
attention
is
again
devoted
wholly
to
the
person
of
importance
feeling
that
to
persist
in
overhearing
their
conversation
would
be
an
indelicacy
the
heroic
explorer
politely
leaves
the
room
and
establishes
himself
on
a
chair
in
a
gloomy
passage
outside
where
he
wiles
away
the
time
by
rehearsing
in
his
imagination
how
he
will
tell
off
the
chief
custodian
when
the
person
of
importance
retires
but
this
the
person
of
importance
shows
no
sign
of
doing
and
the
thoughts
and
intentions
become
darker
and
darker
as
the
day
wears
on
minor
officials
passing
to
and
from
the
presence
look
at
him
doubtfully
and
ask
his
business
the
reply
is
always
the
same
i
am
waiting
for
a
receipt
for
some
penguins
eggs
at
last
it
becomes
clear
from
the
explorer
expression
that
what
he
is
really
waiting
for
is
not
to
take
a
receipt
but
to
commit
murder
presumably
this
is
reported
to
the
destined
victim
at
all
events
the
receipt
finally
comes
and
the
explorer
goes
his
way
with
it
feeling
that
he
has
behaved
like
a
perfect
gentleman
but
so
very
dissatisfied
with
that
vapid
consolation
that
for
hours
he
continues
his
imaginary
rehearsals
of
what
he
would
have
liked
to
have
done
to
that
custodian
mostly
with
his
boots
by
way
of
teaching
him
manners
some
time
after
this
i
visited
the
natural
history
museum
with
captain
scott
sister
after
a
slight
preliminary
skirmish
in
which
we
convinced
a
minor
custodian
that
the
specimens
brought
by
the
expedition
from
the
antarctic
did
not
include
the
moths
we
found
preying
on
some
of
them
miss
scott
expressed
a
wish
to
see
the
penguins
eggs
thereupon
the
minor
custodians
flatly
denied
that
any
such
eggs
were
in
existence
or
in
their
possession
now
miss
scott
was
her
brother
sister
and
she
showed
so
little
disposition
to
take
this
lying
down
that
i
was
glad
to
get
her
away
with
no
worse
consequences
than
a
profanely
emphasized
threat
on
my
part
that
if
we
did
not
receive
ample
satisfaction
in
writing
within
hours
as
to
the
safety
of
the
eggs
england
would
reverberate
with
the
tale
the
ultimatum
was
effectual
and
due
satisfaction
was
forthcoming
in
time
but
i
was
relieved
when
i
learnt
later
on
that
they
had
been
entrusted
to
professor
assheton
for
the
necessary
microscopic
examination
but
he
died
before
he
could
approach
the
task
and
the
eggs
passed
into
the
hands
of
professor
cossar
ewart
of
edinburgh

report
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
wilson
that
no
emperor
penguin
embryos
were
obtained
during
the
cruise
of
the
discovery
but
though
embryos
were
conspicuous
by
their
absence
in
the
emperor
eggs
brought
home
by
the
national
antarctic
expedition
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
naturalists
on
board
the
discovery
learned
much
about
the
breeding
habits
of
the
largest
living
member
of
the
ancient
penguin
family
amongst
other
things
it
was
ascertained
that
in
the
case
of
the
emperor
as
in
the
king
penguin
the
egg
during
the
period
of
incubation
rests
on
the
upper
surface
of
the
feet
protected
and
kept
in
position
by
a
fold
of
skin
from
the
lower
breast
and
that
in
the
case
of
the
emperor
the
whole
process
of
incubation
is
carried
out
on
sea
ice
during
the
coldest
and
darkest
months
of
the
antarctic
winter
after
devoting
much
time
to
the
study
of
penguins
wilson
came
to
the
conclusion
that
emperor
embryos
would
throw
new
light
on
the
origin
and
history
of
birds
and
decided
that
if
he
again
found
his
way
to
the
antarctic
he
would
make
a
supreme
effort
to
visit
an
emperor
rookery
during
the
breeding
season
when
and
under
what
conditions
the
cape
crozier
rookery
was
eventually
visited
and
emperor
eggs
secured
is
graphically
told
in
the
winter
journey
the
question
now
arises
has
weirdest
expedition
that
has
ever
been
made
added
appreciably
to
our
knowledge
of
birds
it
is
admitted
that
birds
are
descended
from
bipedal
reptiles
which
flourished
some
millions
of
years
ago
reptiles
in
build
not
unlike
the
kangaroo
from
archaeopteryx
of
jurassic
times
we
know
primeval
birds
had
teeth
three
fingers
with
claws
on
each
hand
and
a
long
tail
provided
with
nearly
twenty
pairs
of
true
feathers
but
unfortunately
neither
this
bird
nor
yet
the
fossil
birds
found
in
america
throw
any
light
on
the
origin
of
feathers
ornithologists
and
others
who
have
devoted
much
time
to
the
study
of
birds
have
as
a
rule
assumed
that
feathers
were
made
out
of
scales
that
the
scales
along
the
margin
of
the
hand
and
forearm
and
along
each
side
of
the
tail
were
elongated
frayed
and
otherwise
modified
to
form
the
wing
and
tail
quills
and
that
later
other
scales
were
altered
to
provide
a
coat
capable
of
preventing
loss
of
heat
but
as
it
happens
a
study
of
the
development
of
feathers
affords
no
evidence
that
they
were
made
out
of
scales
there
are
neither
rudiments
of
scales
nor
feathers
in
very
young
bird
embryos
in
the
youngest
of
the
three
emperor
embryos
there
are
however
feather
rudiments
in
the
tail
region
the
embryo
was
probably
seven
or
eight
days
old
but
in
the
two
older
embryos
there
are
a
countless
number
of
feather
rudiments
of
minute
pimples
known
as
papillae
in
penguins
as
in
many
other
birds
there
are
two
distinct
crops
of
feather
papillae
viz
a
crop
of
relatively
large
papillae
which
develop
into
prepennae
the
forerunners
of
true
feathers
pennae
and
a
crop
of
small
papillae
which
develop
into
preplumulae
the
forerunners
of
true
down
feathers
plumulae
in
considering
the
origin
of
feathers
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
true
feathers
pennae
but
with
the
nestling
feathers
prepennae
and
more
especially
with
the
papillae
from
which
the
prepennae
are
developed
what
we
want
to
know
is
do
the
papillae
which
in
birds
develop
into
the
first
generation
of
feathers
correspond
to
the
papillae
which
in
lizards
develop
into
scales
the
late
professor
assheton
who
undertook
the
examination
of
some
of
the
material
brought
home
by
the
terra
nova
made
a
special
study
of
the
feather
papillae
of
the
emperor
penguin
embryos
from
cape
crozier
drawings
were
made
to
indicate
the
number
size
and
time
of
appearance
of
the
feather
papillae
but
unfortunately
in
the
notes
left
by
the
distinguished
embryologist
there
is
no
indication
whether
the
feather
papillae
were
regarded
as
modified
scale
papillae
or
new
creations
resulting
from
the
appearance
of
special
factors
in
the
when
eventually
the
three
emperor
penguin
embryos
reached
me
that
their
feather
rudiments
might
be
compared
with
the
feather
rudiments
of
other
birds
i
noticed
that
in
emperor
embryos
the
feather
papillae
appeared
before
the
scale
papillae
evidence
of
this
was
especially
afforded
by
the
largest
embryo
which
had
reached
about
the
same
stage
in
its
development
as
a
goose
embryo
in
the
largest
emperor
embryo
feather
papillae
occur
all
over
the
and
on
the
legs
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
tarsal
joint
beyond
the
tarsal
joint
even
in
the
largest
embryo
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
produce
the
papillae
which
in
older
penguin
embryos
represent
and
ultimately
develop
into
the
scaly
covering
of
the
foot
the
absence
of
papillae
on
the
foot
implied
either
that
the
scale
papillae
were
fundamentally
different
from
feather
papillae
or
that
for
some
reason
or
other
the
development
of
the
papillae
destined
to
give
rise
to
the
foot
scales
had
been
retarded
there
is
no
evidence
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
that
in
modern
lizards
the
scale
papillae
above
the
tarsal
joint
appear
before
the
scale
papillae
beyond
this
joint
the
absence
of
papillae
below
the
tarsal
joint
in
emperor
embryos
together
with
the
fact
that
in
many
birds
each
large
feather
papilla
is
accompanied
by
two
or
more
very
small
feather
papillae
led
me
to
study
the
papillae
of
the
limbs
of
other
birds
the
most
striking
results
were
obtained
from
the
embryos
of
chinese
geese
in
which
the
legs
are
relatively
longer
than
in
penguins
in
a
goose
embryo
the
whole
of
the
skin
below
and
for
some
distance
above
the
tarsal
joint
is
quite
smooth
whereas
the
skin
of
the
rest
of
the
leg
is
studded
with
feather
papillae
on
the
other
hand
in
an
goose
embryo
in
which
the
feather
papillae
of
the
legs
have
developed
into
filaments
each
containing
a
fairly
feather
scale
papillae
occur
not
only
on
the
foot
below
and
for
some
distance
above
the
tarsal
joint
but
also
between
the
roots
of
the
feather
filaments
between
the
tarsal
and
the
knee
joints
more
important
still
in
a
goose
embryo
a
number
of
the
papillae
situated
between
the
feather
filaments
of
the
leg
were
actually
developing
into
scales
each
of
which
overlapped
the
root
calamus
of
a
feather
just
as
scales
overlap
the
foot
feathers
in
grouse
and
other
birds
as
in
bird
embryos
there
is
no
evidence
that
feather
papillae
ever
develop
into
scales
or
that
scale
papillae
ever
develop
into
feathers
it
may
be
assumed
that
feather
papillae
are
fundamentally
different
from
scale
papillae
the
difference
presumably
being
due
to
the
presence
of
special
factors
in
the
just
as
in
armadillos
hairs
are
found
emerging
from
under
the
scales
in
ancient
birds
as
in
the
feet
of
some
modern
birds
the
coat
probably
consisted
of
both
feathers
and
scales
but
in
course
of
time
owing
perhaps
to
the
growth
of
the
scales
being
arrested
the
coat
of
the
birds
instead
of
consisting
throughout
of
scales
and
small
inconspicuous
feathers
was
almost
entirely
made
up
of
a
countless
number
of
downy
feathers
scales
only
persisting
below
the
tarsal
joint
if
the
conclusions
arrived
at
with
the
help
of
the
emperor
penguin
embryos
about
the
origin
of
feathers
are
justified

chapter
viii
spring
inside
was
pandemonium
most
men
had
gone
to
bed
and
i
have
a
blurred
memory
of
men
in
pyjamas
and
getting
hold
of
me
and
trying
to
get
the
chunks
of
armour
which
were
my
clothes
to
leave
my
body
finally
they
cut
them
off
and
threw
them
into
an
angular
heap
at
the
foot
of
my
bunk
next
morning
they
were
a
sodden
mass
weighing
lbs
bread
and
jam
and
cocoa
showers
of
questions
you
know
this
is
the
hardest
journey
ever
made
from
scott
a
broken
record
of
george
robey
on
the
gramophone
which
started
us
laughing
until
in
our
weak
state
we
found
it
difficult
to
stop
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
had
not
stood
the
journey
as
well
as
wilson
my
jaw
had
dropped
when
i
came
in
so
they
tell
me
then
into
my
warm
blanket
bag
and
i
managed
to
keep
awake
just
long
enough
to
think
that
paradise
must
feel
something
like
this
we
slept
ten
thousand
thousand
years
were
wakened
to
find
everybody
at
breakfast
and
passed
a
wonderful
day
lazying
about
half
asleep
and
wholly
happy
listening
to
the
news
and
answering
questions
we
are
looked
upon
as
beings
who
have
come
from
another
world
this
afternoon
i
had
a
shave
after
soaking
my
face
in
a
hot
sponge
and
then
a
bath
lashly
had
already
cut
my
hair
bill
looks
very
thin
and
we
are
all
very
from
want
of
sleep
i
have
not
much
appetite
my
mouth
is
very
dry
and
throat
sore
with
a
troublesome
hacking
cough
which
i
have
had
all
the
journey
my
taste
is
gone
we
are
getting
badly
spoiled
but
our
beds
are
the
height
of
all
our
pleasures
but
this
did
not
last
long
another
very
happy
day
doing
nothing
after
falling
asleep
two
or
three
times
i
went
to
bed
read
kim
and
slept
about
two
hours
after
each
meal
we
all
want
another
and
after
a
tremendous
supper
last
night
we
had
another
meal
before
turning
in
i
have
my
taste
back
but
all
our
fingers
are
impossible
they
might
be
so
many
pieces
of
lead
except
for
the
pins
and
needles
feeling
in
them
which
we
have
also
got
in
our
feet
my
toes
are
very
bulbous
and
some
are
coming
off
my
left
heel
is
one
big
burst
blister
going
straight
out
of
a
warm
bed
into
a
strong
wind
outside
nearly
bowled
me
over
i
felt
quite
faint
and
pulled
myself
together
thinking
it
was
all
nerves
but
it
began
to
come
on
again
and
i
had
to
make
for
the
hut
as
quickly
as
possible
birdie
is
now
full
of
schemes
for
doing
the
trip
again
next
year
bill
says
it
is
too
great
a
risk
in
the
darkness
and
he
will
not
consider
it
though
he
thinks
that
to
go
in
august
might
be
possible
and
again
a
day
or
two
later
i
came
in
covered
with
a
red
rash
which
is
rather
ticklish
my
ankles
and
knees
are
a
bit
puffy
but
my
feet
are
not
so
painful
as
bill
and
birdie
hands
itch
a
bit
we
must
be
very
weak
and
worn
out
though
i
think
birdie
is
the
strongest
of
us
he
seems
to
be
picking
up
very
quickly
bill
is
still
very
worn
and
rather
haggard
the
kindness
of
everybody
would
spoil
an
angel
i
have
put
these
personal
experiences
down
from
my
diary
because
they
are
the
only
contemporary
record
i
possess
scott
own
diary
at
this
time
contains
the
statement
the
crozier
party
returned
last
night
after
enduring
for
five
weeks
the
hardest
conditions
on
record
they
looked
more
than
any
one
i
have
yet
seen
their
faces
were
scarred
and
wrinkled
their
eyes
dull
their
hands
whitened
and
creased
with
the
constant
exposure
to
damp
and
cold
yet
the
scars
of
were
very
few
after
a
night
rest
our
travellers
are
very
different
in
appearance
and
mental
capacity
atch
has
been
lost
in
a
blizzard
was
the
news
which
we
got
as
soon
as
we
could
grasp
anything
since
then
he
has
spent
a
year
of
war
in
the
north
sea
seen
the
dardanelles
campaign
and
much
fighting
in
france
and
has
been
blown
up
in
a
monitor
i
doubt
whether
he
does
not
reckon
that
night
the
worst
of
the
lot
he
ought
to
have
been
blown
into
hundreds
of
little
bits
but
always
like
some
hardy
indiarubber
ball
he
turns
up
again
a
little
dented
but
with
the
same
tough
elasticity
which
refuses
to
be
hurt
and
with
the
same
quiet
voice
he
volunteers
for
the
next
and
tells
you
how
splendid
everybody
was
except
himself
it
was
the
blizzard
of
july
when
we
were
lying
in
the
windless
bight
on
our
way
to
cape
crozier
and
we
knew
it
must
be
blowing
all
round
us
at
any
rate
it
was
blowing
at
cape
evans
though
it
eased
up
in
the
afternoon
and
atkinson
and
taylor
went
up
the
ramp
to
read
the
thermometers
there
they
returned
without
great
difficulty
and
some
discussion
seems
to
have
arisen
as
to
whether
it
was
possible
to
read
the
two
screens
on
the
atkinson
said
he
would
go
and
read
that
in
north
bay
gran
said
he
was
going
to
south
bay
they
started
independently
at
gran
returned
an
hour
and
a
quarter
afterwards
he
had
gone
about
two
hundred
yards
atkinson
had
not
gone
much
farther
when
he
decided
that
he
had
better
give
it
up
so
he
turned
and
faced
the
wind
steering
by
keeping
it
on
his
cheek
we
discovered
afterwards
that
the
wind
does
not
blow
quite
in
the
same
direction
at
the
end
of
the
cape
as
it
does
just
where
the
hut
lies
perhaps
it
was
this
perhaps
his
left
leg
carried
him
a
little
farther
than
his
right
perhaps
it
was
that
the
numbing
effect
of
a
blizzard
on
a
man
brain
was
already
having
its
effect
certainly
atkinson
does
not
know
himself
but
instead
of
striking
the
cape
which
ran
across
his
true
front
he
found
himself
by
an
old
fish
trap
which
he
knew
was
yards
out
on
the
he
made
a
great
effort
to
steady
himself
and
make
for
the
cape
but
any
one
who
has
stood
in
a
blizzard
will
understand
how
difficult
that
is
the
snow
was
a
blanket
raging
all
round
him
and
it
was
quite
dark
he
walked
on
and
found
nothing
everything
else
is
vague
hour
after
hour
he
staggered
about
he
got
his
hand
badly
he
found
pressure
he
fell
over
it
he
was
crawling
in
it
on
his
hands
and
knees
stumbling
tumbling
tripping
buffeted
by
the
endless
lash
of
the
wind
sprawling
through
miles
of
punishing
snow
he
still
seems
to
have
kept
his
brain
working
he
found
an
island
thought
it
was
inaccessible
spent
ages
in
coasting
along
it
lost
it
found
more
pressure
and
crawled
along
it
he
found
another
island
and
the
same
horrible
almost
senseless
search
went
on
under
the
lee
of
some
rocks
he
waited
for
a
time
his
clothing
was
thin
though
he
had
his
and
a
horrible
thought
if
this
was
to
go
on
he
had
boots
on
his
feet
instead
of
warm
finnesko
here
also
he
kicked
out
a
hole
in
a
drift
where
he
might
have
more
chance
if
he
were
forced
to
lie
down
for
sleep
is
the
end
of
men
who
get
lost
in
blizzards
though
he
did
not
know
it
he
must
now
have
been
out
more
than
four
hours
there
was
little
chance
for
him
if
the
blizzard
continued
but
hope
revived
when
the
moon
showed
in
a
partial
lull
it
is
wonderful
that
he
was
sufficiently
active
to
grasp
the
significance
of
this
and
groping
back
in
his
brain
he
found
he
could
remember
the
bearing
of
the
moon
from
cape
evans
when
he
went
to
bed
the
night
before
the
hut
must
be
somewhere
over
there
this
must
be
inaccessible
island
he
left
the
island
and
made
in
that
direction
but
the
blizzard
came
down
again
with
added
force
and
the
moon
was
blotted
out
he
tried
to
return
to
the
island
and
failed
then
he
stumbled
on
another
island
perhaps
the
same
one
and
waited
again
the
lull
came
and
again
he
set
off
and
walked
and
walked
until
he
recognized
inaccessible
island
on
his
left
clearly
he
must
have
been
under
great
razorback
island
and
this
is
some
four
miles
from
cape
evans
the
moon
still
showed
and
on
he
walked
and
then
at
last
he
saw
a
flame
atkinson
continued
absence
was
not
noticed
at
the
hut
until
dinner
was
nearly
over
at
that
is
until
he
had
been
absent
about
two
hours
the
wind
at
cape
evans
had
dropped
though
it
was
thick
all
round
and
no
great
anxiety
was
felt
some
went
out
and
shouted
others
went
north
with
a
lantern
and
day
arranged
to
light
a
paraffin
flare
on
wind
vane
hill
atkinson
never
experienced
this
lull
and
having
seen
the
way
blizzards
will
sweep
down
the
strait
though
the
coastline
is
comparatively
clear
and
calm
i
can
understand
how
he
was
in
the
thick
of
it
all
the
time
i
feel
convinced
that
most
of
these
blizzards
are
local
affairs
the
party
which
had
gone
north
returned
at
without
news
and
scott
became
seriously
alarmed
between
and
six
search
parties
started
out
but
time
was
passing
and
atkinson
had
been
away
more
than
six
hours
the
light
which
atkinson
had
seen
was
a
flare
of
tow
soaked
in
petrol
lit
by
day
at
cape
evans
he
corrected
his
course
and
before
long
was
under
the
rock
upon
which
day
could
be
seen
working
like
some
lanky
devil
in
one
of
dante
hells
atkinson
shouted
again
and
again
but
could
not
attract
his
attention
and
finally
walked
almost
into
the
hut
before
he
was
found
by
two
men
searching
the
cape
it
was
all
my
own
damned
fault
he
said
but
scott
never
slanged
me
at
all
i
really
think
we
should
all
have
been
as
merciful
would
and
that
was
that
but
he
had
a
beastly
hand
theoretically
the
sun
returned
to
us
on
august
practically
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
except
blinding
drift
but
we
saw
his
upper
limb
two
days
later
in
scott
words
the
daylight
came
rushing
at
us
two
spring
journeys
were
contemplated
and
with
preparations
for
the
polar
journey
and
the
ordinary
routine
work
of
the
station
everybody
had
as
much
on
his
hands
as
he
could
get
through
lieutenant
evans
gran
and
forde
volunteered
to
go
out
to
corner
camp
and
dig
out
this
depôt
as
well
as
that
of
safety
camp
they
started
on
september
and
camped
on
the
beyond
cape
armitage
that
night
the
minimum
temperature
being
they
dug
out
safety
camp
next
morning
and
marched
on
towards
corner
camp
the
minimum
that
night
was
the
next
evening
they
made
their
night
camp
as
a
blizzard
was
coming
up
the
temperature
at
the
same
time
being
and
minimum
for
the
night
this
is
an
extremely
low
temperature
for
a
blizzard
they
made
a
start
in
a
very
cold
wind
the
next
afternoon
september
and
camped
at
that
night
was
bitterly
cold
and
they
found
that
the
minimum
showed
for
that
night
evans
reports
adversely
on
the
use
of
the
bag
and
inner
tent
but
here
none
of
our
winter
journey
men
would
agree
with
him
most
of
september
was
spent
in
digging
out
corner
camp
which
they
left
at
intending
to
travel
back
to
hut
point
without
stopping
except
for
meals
they
marched
all
through
that
night
with
two
halts
for
meals
and
arrived
at
hut
point
at
on
september
having
covered
a
distance
of
statute
miles
they
reached
cape
evans
the
following
day
after
an
absence
of
days
during
this
journey
forde
got
his
hand
badly
which
necessitated
his
return
in
the
terra
nova
in
march
he
owed
a
good
deal
to
the
skilful
treatment
atkinson
gave
it
wilson
was
still
looking
grey
and
drawn
some
days
and
i
was
not
too
fit
but
bowers
was
indefatigable
soon
after
we
got
in
from
cape
crozier
he
heard
that
scott
was
going
over
to
the
western
mountains
somehow
or
other
he
persuaded
scott
to
take
him
and
they
started
with
seaman
evans
and
simpson
on
september
on
what
scott
calls
a
remarkably
pleasant
and
instructive
little
spring
journey
and
what
bowers
called
a
jolly
picnic
this
picnic
started
from
the
hut
in
a
temperature
dragging
lbs
per
man
mainly
composed
of
stores
for
the
geological
party
of
the
summer
they
penetrated
as
far
north
as
dunlop
island
and
turned
back
from
there
on
september
reaching
cape
evans
on
september
marching
miles
statute
into
a
blizzard
wind
with
occasional
storms
of
drift
and
a
temperature
of
and
they
marched
a
little
too
long
for
a
storm
of
drift
came
against
them
and
they
had
to
camp
it
is
never
very
easy
pitching
a
tent
on
because
there
is
not
very
much
snow
on
the
ice
on
this
occasion
it
was
only
after
they
had
detached
the
inner
tent
which
was
fastened
to
the
bamboos
that
they
could
hold
the
bamboos
and
then
it
was
only
inch
by
inch
that
they
got
the
outer
cover
on
at
the
drift
took
off
though
the
wind
was
as
strong
as
ever
and
they
decided
to
make
for
cape
evans
they
arrived
at
after
one
of
the
most
strenuous
days
which
scott
could
remember
and
that
meant
a
good
deal
simpson
face
was
a
sight
during
his
absence
griffith
taylor
became
he
was
a
greedy
scientist
and
he
also
wielded
a
fluent
pen
consequently
his
output
during
the
year
and
a
half
which
he
spent
with
us
was
large
and
ranged
from
the
results
of
the
two
excellent
scientific
journeys
which
he
led
in
the
western
mountains
to
this
work
during
the
latter
half
of
september
he
was
a
most
valued
contributor
to
the
south
polar
times
and
his
prose
and
poetry
both
had
a
bite
which
was
never
equalled
by
any
other
of
our
amateur
journalists
when
his
pen
was
still
his
tongue
wagged
and
the
arguments
he
led
were
legion
the
hut
was
a
merrier
place
for
his
presence
when
the
weather
was
good
he
might
be
seen
striding
over
the
rocks
with
a
complete
disregard
of
the
effect
on
his
clothes
he
wore
through
a
pair
of
boots
quicker
than
anybody
i
have
ever
known
and
his
socks
had
to
be
mended
with
string
ice
movement
and
erosion
were
also
of
interest
to
him
and
almost
every
day
he
spent
some
time
in
studying
the
slopes
and
huge
of
the
barne
glacier
and
other
points
of
interest
with
equal
ferocity
he
would
throw
himself
into
his
curtained
bunk
because
he
was
bored
or
emerge
from
it
to
take
part
in
some
argument
which
was
troubling
the
table
his
diary
must
have
been
almost
as
long
as
the
reports
he
wrote
for
scott
of
his
geological
explorations
he
was
a
demon
and
he
had
a
passion
for
being
equipped
so
that
he
could
cope
with
any
observation
which
might
turn
up
thus
old
griff
on
a
sledge
journey
might
have
notebooks
protruding
from
every
pocket
and
hung
about
his
person
a
sundial
a
prismatic
compass
a
sheath
knife
a
pair
of
binoculars
a
geological
hammer
chronometer
pedometer
camera
aneroid
and
other
items
of
surveying
gear
as
well
as
his
goggles
and
mitts
and
in
his
hand
might
be
an
which
he
used
as
he
went
along
to
the
possible
advancement
of
science
but
the
certain
disorganization
of
his
companions
his
gaunt
untamed
appearance
was
atoned
for
by
a
halo
of
which
hovered
about
his
head
i
am
sure
he
must
have
been
an
untidy
person
to
have
in
your
tent
i
feel
equally
sure
that
his
would
have
been
sorry
to
lose
him
his
gear
took
up
more
room
than
was
strictly
his
share
and
his
mind
also
filled
up
a
considerable
amount
of
space
he
always
bulked
large
and
when
he
returned
to
the
australian
government
which
had
lent
him
for
the
first
two
sledging
seasons
he
left
a
noticeable
gap
in
our
company
from
the
time
we
returned
from
cape
crozier
until
now
scott
had
been
full
of
buck
our
return
had
taken
a
weight
off
his
mind
the
return
of
the
daylight
was
stimulating
to
everybody
and
to
a
man
of
his
impatient
and
impetuous
temperament
the
end
of
the
long
period
of
waiting
was
a
relief
also
everything
was
going
well
on
september
he
writes
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
the
detailed
plans
for
the
southern
journey
are
finished
at
last
every
figure
has
been
checked
by
bowers
who
has
been
an
enormous
help
to
me
if
the
motors
are
successful
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
glacier
and
if
they
fail
we
shall
still
get
there
with
any
ordinary
degree
of
good
fortune
to
work
three
units
of
four
men
from
that
point
onwards
requires
no
small
provision
but
with
the
proper
provision
it
should
take
a
good
deal
to
stop
the
attainment
of
our
object
i
have
tried
to
take
every
reasonable
possibility
of
misfortune
into
consideration
and
to
so
organize
the
parties
as
to
be
prepared
to
meet
them
i
fear
to
be
too
sanguine
yet
taking
everything
into
consideration
i
feel
that
our
chances
ought
to
be
good
and
again
he
writes
of
hopeful
signs
for
the
future
none
are
more
remarkable
than
the
health
and
spirit
of
our
people
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
a
more
vigorous
community
and
there
does
not
seem
to
be
a
single
weak
spot
in
the
twelve
good
men
and
true
who
are
chosen
for
the
southern
advance
all
are
now
experienced
sledge
travellers
knit
together
with
a
bond
of
friendship
that
has
never
been
equalled
under
such
circumstances
thanks
to
these
people
and
more
especially
to
bowers
and
petty
officer
evans
there
is
not
a
single
detail
of
our
equipment
which
is
not
arranged
with
the
utmost
care
and
in
accordance
with
the
tests
of
experience
indeed
bowers
had
been
of
the
very
greatest
use
to
scott
in
the
working
out
of
these
plans
not
only
had
he
all
the
details
of
stores
at
his
but
he
had
studied
polar
clothing
and
polar
food
was
full
of
plans
and
alternative
plans
and
best
of
all
refused
to
be
beaten
by
any
problem
which
presented
itself
the
actual
distribution
of
weights
between
dogs
motors
and
ponies
and
between
the
different
ponies
was
largely
left
in
his
hands
we
had
only
to
lead
our
ponies
out
on
the
day
of
the
start
and
we
were
sure
to
find
our
sledges
ready
each
with
the
right
load
and
weight
to
the
leader
of
an
expedition
such
a
man
was
worth
his
weight
in
gold
but
now
scott
became
worried
and
unhappy
we
were
running
things
on
a
fine
margin
of
transport
and
during
the
month
before
we
were
due
to
start
mishap
followed
mishap
in
the
most
disgusting
way
three
men
were
more
or
less
incapacitated
forde
with
his
frozen
hand
clissold
who
concussed
himself
by
a
fall
from
a
berg
and
debenham
who
hurt
his
knee
seriously
when
playing
one
of
the
ponies
jehu
was
such
a
crock
that
at
one
time
it
was
decided
not
to
take
him
out
at
all
and
very
bad
opinions
were
also
held
of
chinaman
another
dog
died
of
a
mysterious
disease
it
is
trying
writes
scott
but
i
am
past
despondency
things
must
take
their
course
and
if
this
waiting
were
to
continue
it
looks
as
though
we
should
become
a
regular
party
of
then
on
the
top
of
all
this
came
a
bad
accident
to
one
of
the
motor
axles
on
the
eve
of
departure
the
motors
were
to
be
taken
on
to
the
floe
the
drifts
made
the
road
very
uneven
and
the
first
and
best
motor
overrode
its
chain
the
chain
was
replaced
and
the
machine
proceeded
but
just
short
of
the
floe
was
thrust
to
a
steep
inclination
by
a
ridge
and
the
chain
again
overrode
the
sprockets
this
time
by
ill
fortune
day
slipped
at
the
critical
moment
and
without
intention
jammed
the
throttle
full
on
the
engine
brought
up
but
there
was
an
ominous
trickle
of
oil
under
the
back
axle
and
investigation
showed
that
the
axle
casing
aluminium
had
split
the
casing
had
been
stripped
and
brought
into
the
hut
we
may
be
able
to
do
something
to
it
but
time
presses
it
all
goes
to
show
that
we
want
more
experience
and
workshops
i
am
secretly
convinced
that
we
shall
not
get
much
help
from
the
motors
yet
nothing
has
ever
happened
to
them
that
was
unavoidable
a
little
more
care
and
foresight
would
make
them
splendid
allies
the
trouble
is
that
if
they
fail
no
one
will
ever
believe
this
in
the
meantime
meares
and
dimitri
ran
out
to
corner
camp
from
hut
point
twice
with
the
two
the
first
time
they
journeyed
out
and
back
in
two
days
and
a
night
returning
on
october
and
another
very
similar
run
was
made
before
the
end
of
the
month
the
motor
party
was
to
start
first
but
was
delayed
until
october
they
were
to
wait
for
us
in
latitude
certain
loads
on
if
the
motors
broke
down
the
two
engineers
were
day
and
lashly
and
their
two
helpers
who
steered
by
pulling
on
a
rope
in
front
were
lieutenant
evans
and
hooper
scott
was
immensely
eager
that
these
tractors
should
succeed
even
though
they
may
not
be
of
great
help
to
our
southern
advance
a
small
measure
of
success
will
be
enough
to
show
their
possibilities
their
ability
to
revolutionize
polar
transport
lashly
as
the
reader
may
know
by
now
was
a
chief
stoker
in
the
navy
and
accompanied
scott
on
his
plateau
journey
in
the
discovery
days
the
following
account
of
the
motors
chequered
career
is
from
his
diary
and
for
permission
to
include
here
both
it
and
the
story
of
the
adventures
of
the
second
return
party
an
extraordinarily
vivid
and
simple
narrative
i
can
not
be
too
grateful
after
the
motors
had
been
two
days
on
the
on
their
way
to
hut
point
lashly
writes
on
october
kicked
off
at
engine
going
well
surface
much
better
dropped
one
can
of
petrol
each
and
lubricating
oil
lunched
about
two
miles
from
hut
point
captain
scott
and
supporting
party
came
from
cape
evans
to
help
us
over
blue
ice
but
they
were
not
required
got
away
again
after
lunch
but
was
delayed
by
the
other
sledge
not
being
able
to
get
along
it
is
beginning
to
dawn
on
me
the
sledges
are
not
powerful
enough
for
the
work
as
it
is
one
continual
drag
over
this
perhaps
it
will
improve
on
the
barrier
it
seems
we
are
going
to
be
troubled
with
engine
overheating
after
we
have
run
about
to
a
mile
it
is
necessary
to
stop
at
least
half
an
hour
to
cool
the
engine
down
then
we
have
to
close
up
for
a
few
minutes
to
allow
the
carbrutta
to
warm
up
or
we
ca
get
the
petrol
to
vaporize
we
are
getting
new
experiences
every
day
we
arrived
at
hut
point
and
proceeded
to
cape
armitage
it
having
come
on
to
snow
pretty
thickly
so
we
pitched
our
tent
and
waited
for
the
other
car
to
come
up
she
has
been
delayed
all
the
afternoon
and
not
made
much
headway
at
bowers
and
garrard
came
out
to
us
and
told
us
to
come
back
to
hut
point
for
the
night
where
we
all
enjoyed
ourselves
with
a
good
hoosh
and
a
nice
night
with
all
hands
october
this
morning
being
fine
made
our
way
out
to
the
cars
and
got
them
going
after
a
bit
of
trouble
the
temperature
being
a
bit
low
i
got
away
in
good
style
the
surface
seems
to
be
improving
it
is
better
for
running
on
but
very
rough
and
the
overheating
is
not
overcome
nor
likely
to
be
as
far
as
i
can
see
just
before
arriving
at
the
barrier
my
car
began
to
develop
some
strange
knocking
in
the
engine
but
with
the
help
of
the
party
with
us
i
managed
to
get
on
the
barrier
the
other
car
got
up
the
slope
in
fine
style
and
waited
for
me
to
come
up
as
my
engine
is
giving
trouble
we
decided
to
camp
have
lunch
and
see
what
is
the
matter
on
opening
the
crank
chamber
we
found
the
crank
brasses
broke
into
little
pieces
so
there
is
nothing
left
to
do
but
replace
them
with
the
spare
ones
of
course
this
meant
a
cold
job
for
day
and
myself
as
handling
metal
on
the
barrier
is
not
a
thing
one
looks
forward
to
with
pleasure
anyhow
we
set
about
it
after
lieutenant
evans
and
hooper
had
rigged
up
a
screen
to
shelter
us
a
bit
and
by
we
were
finished
and
ready
to
proceed
but
owing
to
a
very
low
temperature
we
found
it
difficult
to
get
the
engines
to
go
so
we
decided
to
camp
for
the
night
october
turned
out
and
had
another
go
at
starting
which
took
some
little
time
owing
again
to
the
low
temperature
we
got
away
but
again
the
trouble
is
always
staring
us
in
the
face
overheating
and
the
surface
is
so
bad
and
the
pull
so
heavy
and
constant
that
it
looks
we
are
in
for
a
rough
time
we
are
continually
waiting
for
one
another
to
come
up
and
every
time
we
stop
something
has
to
be
done
my
fan
got
jammed
and
delayed
us
some
time
but
have
got
it
right
again
evans
had
to
go
back
for
his
spare
gear
owing
to
some
one
not
bringing
it
out
in
mistake
he
had
a
good
tramp
as
we
were
about
miles
out
from
hut
point
october
again
we
got
away
but
did
not
get
far
before
the
other
car
began
to
give
trouble
i
went
back
to
see
what
was
the
matter
it
seems
the
petrol
is
dirty
due
perhaps
to
putting
in
a
new
drum
anyhow
got
her
up
and
camped
for
lunch
after
lunch
made
a
move
and
all
seemed
to
be
going
well
when
day
car
gave
out
at
the
crank
brasses
the
same
as
mine
so
we
shall
have
to
see
what
is
the
next
best
thing
to
do
october
this
morning
before
getting
the
car
on
the
way
had
to
reconstruct
our
loads
as
day
car
is
finished
and
no
more
use
for
further
service
we
have
got
all
four
of
us
with
one
car
now
things
seems
to
be
going
fairly
well
but
we
are
still
troubled
with
the
overheating
which
means
to
say
half
our
time
is
wasted
we
can
see
dawning
on
us
the
harness
before
long
we
covered
seven
miles
and
camped
for
the
night
we
are
now
about
six
miles
from
corner
camp
october
got
away
with
difficulty
and
nearly
reached
corner
camp
but
the
weather
was
unkind
and
forced
us
to
camp
early
one
thing
we
have
been
able
to
bring
along
a
good
supply
of
pony
food
and
most
of
the
man
food
but
so
far
the
motor
sledges
have
proved
a
failure
november
started
away
with
the
usual
amount
of
agony
and
soon
arrived
at
corner
camp
where
we
left
a
note
to
captain
scott
explaining
the
cause
of
our
breakdown
i
told
evans
to
say
this
sledge
wo
go
much
farther
after
getting
about
a
mile
past
corner
camp
my
engine
gave
out
finally
so
here
is
an
end
to
the
motor
sledges
i
ca
say
i
am
sorry
because
i
am
not
and
the
others
are
i
think
of
the
same
opinion
as
myself
we
have
had
a
heavy
task
pulling
the
heavy
sledges
up
every
time
we
stopped
which
was
pretty
frequent
even
now
we
have
to
start
we
shall
not
be
much
more
tired
than
we
have
already
been
at
night
when
we
had
finished
now
comes
the
part
of
the
show
after
reorganizing
our
sledge
and
taking
aboard
all
the
man
food
we
can
pull
we
started
with
lbs
per
man
a
strong
head
wind
made
it
a
bit
uncomfortable
for
getting
along
anyhow
we
made
good
about
three
miles
and
camped
for
the
night
the
surface
not
being
very
good
made
the
travelling
a
bit
heavy
after
three
days
november
made
good
about
miles
if
the
surface
would
only
remain
as
it
is
now
we
could
get
along
pretty
well
we
are
now
thinking
of
the
ponies
being
on
their
way
hope
they
will
get
better
luck
than
we
had
with
the
motor
sledges
but
by
what
i
can
see
they
will
have
a
tough
time
of
it
november
we
have
worked
hard
and
covered
a
good
distance
miles
surface
rough
but
slippery
all
seems
to
be
going
pretty
well
but
we
have
generally
had
enough
by
the
time
comes
for
us
to
camp
november
we
have
again
made
good
progress
but
the
light
was
very
trying
sometimes
we
could
not
see
at
all
where
we
were
going
i
tried
to
find
some
of
the
cairns
that
were
built
by
the
depôt
party
last
year
came
upon
one
this
afternoon
which
is
about
miles
from
one
ton
depôt
so
at
the
rate
we
have
been
travelling
we
ought
to
reach
there
some
time
night
temperature
was
pretty
low
but
we
are
beginning
to
get
hardened
into
it
now
november
made
a
good
start
but
the
surface
is
getting
softer
every
day
and
makes
our
legs
ache
we
arrived
at
one
ton
depôt
and
camped
then
proceeded
to
dig
out
some
of
the
provisions
we
have
to
take
on
all
the
man
food
we
can
this
is
a
place
no
doubt
have
not
seen
anything
of
the
ponies
november
we
have
started
on
the
second
stage
of
our
journey
our
orders
are
to
proceed
one
degree
south
of
one
ton
depôt
and
wait
for
the
ponies
and
dogs
to
come
up
with
us
as
we
have
been
making
good
distances
each
day
the
party
will
hardly
overtake
us
but
we
have
found
the
load
is
much
heavier
to
drag
we
have
just
over
lbs
per
man
and
we
have
been
brought
up
on
several
occasions
and
to
start
again
required
a
pretty
good
strain
on
the
rope
anyhow
we
done
miles
a
pretty
good
show
considering
all
things
november
again
we
started
off
with
plenty
of
vim
but
it
was
jolly
tough
work
and
it
begins
to
tell
on
all
of
us
the
surface
is
covered
with
soft
crystals
which
do
improve
things
hooper
is
pretty
well
done
up
but
he
have
stuck
it
well
and
i
hope
he
will
although
he
could
not
tackle
the
food
in
the
best
of
spirits
we
know
he
wanted
it
evans
day
and
myself
could
eat
more
as
we
are
just
beginning
to
feel
the
tightening
of
the
belt
made
good
miles
and
we
are
now
building
cairns
all
the
way
one
about
three
miles
then
again
at
lunch
and
one
in
the
afternoon
and
one
at
night
this
will
keep
us
employed
november
it
has
been
very
heavy
work
the
surface
is
very
bad
and
we
are
pretty
well
full
up
but
not
with
food
is
no
doubt
the
hardest
work
one
can
do
no
wonder
the
motor
sledges
could
not
stand
it
i
have
been
thinking
of
the
trials
i
witnessed
of
the
motor
engines
in
wolseley
works
in
birmingham
they
were
pretty
stiff
but
nothing
compared
to
the
drag
of
a
heavy
load
on
the
barrier
surface
november
have
been
similar
to
the
two
previous
days
but
the
light
have
been
bad
and
snow
have
been
falling
which
do
not
improve
the
surface
we
have
been
doing
miles
a
day
geographical
and
quite
enough
too
as
we
have
all
had
enough
by
time
it
goes
camp
november
the
weather
seems
to
be
on
the
change
should
not
be
surprised
if
we
do
get
a
blizzard
before
long
but
of
course
we
do
want
that
hooper
seems
a
bit
fagged
but
he
sticks
it
pretty
well
day
keeps
on
plodding
his
only
complaint
is
should
like
a
little
more
to
eat
november
when
we
started
this
morning
evans
said
we
had
about
miles
to
go
to
reach
the
required
distance
the
hauling
have
been
about
the
same
but
the
weather
is
somewhat
finer
and
the
blizzard
gone
off
we
did
miles
and
camped
have
not
seen
anything
of
the
main
party
yet
but
shall
not
be
surprised
to
see
them
at
any
time
november
we
are
camped
after
doing
five
miles
where
we
are
supposed
to
be
lat
now
we
have
to
wait
the
others
coming
up
evans
is
quite
proud
to
think
we
have
arrived
before
the
others
caught
us
but
we
expect
they
will
be
long
although
we
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
as
our
daily
distance
have
been
good
we
have
built
a
large
cairn
this
afternoon
before
turning
in
the
weather
is
cold
but
excellent
they
waited
there
six
days
before
the
pony
party
arrived
when
the
upper
barrier
depôt
mount
hooper
was
left
in
the
cairn

until

it
may

that

we
shall
touch

and
see
the
great
achilles
whom
we
knew

much
is

much

and
we
are
not

which
in

moved

we
are

not

tennyson
take
it
all
in
all
it
is
wonderful
that
the
south
pole
was
reached
so
soon
after
the
north
pole
had
been
conquered
from
cape
columbia
to
the
north
pole
straight
going
is
geographical
miles
and
peary
who
took
on
his
expedition
dogs
covered
this
distance
in
days
from
hut
point
to
the
south
pole
and
back
is
geographical
or
statute
miles
the
distance
to
the
top
of
the
beardmore
glacier
alone
being
more
than
miles
farther
than
peary
had
to
cover
to
the
north
pole
scott
travelled
from
hut
point
to
the
south
pole
in
days
and
to
the
pole
and
back
to
his
last
camp
in
days
a
period
of
five
months
all
miles
are
geographical
unless
otherwise
stated
i
the
barrier
stage
the
departure
from
cape
evans
at
on
november
is
described
by
griffith
taylor
who
started
a
few
days
later
on
the
second
geological
journey
with
his
own
party
on
the
october
the
pony
parties
started
two
weak
ponies
led
by
atkinson
and
keohane
were
sent
off
first
at
and
i
accompanied
them
for
about
a
mile
keohane
pony
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
jimmy
pigg
and
he
stepped
out
much
better
than
his
mate
jehu
we
heard
through
the
telephone
of
their
safe
arrival
at
hut
point
next
morning
the
southern
party
finished
their
mail
posting
it
in
the
packing
case
on
atkinson
bunk
and
then
at
the
last
party
were
ready
for
the
pole
they
had
packed
the
sledges
overnight
and
they
took
lbs
personal
baggage
the
owner
had
asked
me
what
book
he
should
take
he
wanted
something
fairly
filling
i
recommended
glaciers
if
he
would
find
it
he
did
fancy
this
so
then
i
said
not
take
browning
as
i
doing
and
i
believe
that
he
did
so
wright
pony
was
the
first
harnessed
to
its
sledge
chinaman
is
rival
for
last
place
and
as
some
compensation
is
easy
to
harness
seaman
evans
led
snatcher
who
used
to
rush
ahead
and
take
the
lead
as
soon
as
he
was
harnessed
cherry
had
michael
a
steady
goer
and
wilson
led
nobby
the
pony
rescued
from
the
killer
whales
in
march
scott
led
out
snippets
to
the
sledges
and
harnessed
him
to
the
foremost
with
little
anton
help
only
it
turned
out
to
be
bowers
sledge
however
he
transferred
in
a
few
minutes
and
marched
off
rapidly
to
the
south
christopher
as
usual
behaved
like
a
demon
first
they
had
to
trice
his
front
leg
up
tight
under
his
shoulder
then
it
took
five
minutes
to
throw
him
the
sledge
was
brought
up
and
he
was
harnessed
in
while
his
head
was
held
down
on
the
floe
finally
he
rose
up
still
on
three
legs
and
started
off
galloping
as
well
as
he
was
able
after
several
violent
kicks
his
foreleg
was
released
and
after
more
flicks
with
his
hind
legs
he
set
off
fairly
steadily
titus
ca
stop
him
when
once
he
has
started
and
will
have
to
do
the
fifteen
miles
in
one
lap
probably
dear
old
titus
that
was
my
last
memory
of
him
imperturbable
as
ever
never
hasty
never
angry
but
soothing
that
vicious
animal
and
determined
to
get
the
best
out
of
most
unpromising
material
in
his
endeavour
to
do
his
simple
duty
bowers
was
last
to
leave
his
pony
victor
nervous
but
not
vicious
was
soon
in
the
traces
i
ran
to
the
end
of
the
cape
and
watched
the
little
cavalcade
already
strung
out
into
remote
units
rapidly
fade
into
the
lonely
white
waste
to
southward
that
evening
i
had
a
chat
with
wilson
over
the
telephone
from
the
discovery
hut
my
last
communication
with
those
five
gallant
spirits
all
the
ponies
arrived
at
hut
point
by
just
in
time
to
escape
a
stiff
blow
three
of
them
were
housed
with
ourselves
inside
the
hut
the
rest
being
put
into
the
verandah
the
march
showed
that
with
their
loads
the
speed
of
the
different
ponies
varied
to
such
an
extent
that
individuals
were
soon
separated
by
miles
it
reminded
me
of
a
regatta
or
a
somewhat
disorganized
fleet
with
ships
of
very
unequal
speed
it
was
decided
to
change
to
night
marching
and
the
following
evening
we
proceeded
in
the
following
order
which
was
the
way
of
our
going
for
the
present
the
three
slowest
ponies
started
first
namely
jehu
with
atkinson
chinaman
with
wright
james
pigg
with
keohane
this
party
was
known
as
the
baltic
fleet
two
hours
later
scott
party
followed
scott
with
snippets
wilson
with
nobby
and
myself
with
michael
both
these
parties
camped
for
lunch
in
the
middle
of
the
night
march
after
another
hour
the
remaining
four
men
set
to
work
to
get
christopher
into
his
sledge
when
he
was
started
they
harnessed
in
their
own
ponies
as
quickly
as
possible
and
followed
making
a
run
right
through
the
night
march
it
was
bad
for
men
and
ponies
but
it
was
impossible
to
camp
in
the
middle
of
the
march
owing
to
christopher
the
composition
of
this
party
was
oates
with
christopher
bowers
with
victor
seaman
evans
with
snatcher
crean
with
bones
each
of
these
three
parties
was
with
tent
cooker
and
weekly
bag
and
the
times
of
starting
were
so
planned
that
the
three
parties
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
march
about
the
same
time
there
was
a
strong
head
wind
and
low
drift
as
we
rounded
cape
armitage
on
our
way
to
the
barrier
and
the
future
probably
there
were
few
of
us
who
did
not
wonder
when
we
should
see
the
old
familiar
place
again
scott
party
camped
at
safety
camp
as
the
baltic
fleet
were
getting
under
weigh
again
soon
afterwards
ponting
appeared
with
a
dog
sledge
and
a
cinematograph
how
anomalous
it
seemed
which
was
up
in
time
to
catch
the
flying
rearguard
which
came
along
in
fine
form
snatcher
leading
and
being
stopped
every
now
and
again
a
wonderful
little
beast
christopher
had
given
the
usual
trouble
when
harnessed
but
was
evidently
subdued
by
the
barrier
surface
however
it
was
not
thought
advisable
to
halt
him
and
so
the
party
fled
through
in
the
wake
of
the
advance
guard
immediately
afterwards
scott
party
packed
up
and
good
luck
from
ponting
a
wave
of
the
hand
not
holding
in
a
frisky
pony
and
we
had
left
the
last
link
with
the
hut
the
future
is
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
i
can
think
of
nothing
left
undone
to
deserve
success
the
general
scheme
was
to
average
miles
statute
a
day
from
hut
point
to
one
ton
depôt
with
the
ponies
lightly
laden
from
one
ton
to
the
gateway
a
daily
average
of
miles
statute
was
necessary
to
carry
weekly
units
of
food
for
four
men
each
to
the
bottom
of
the
glacier
this
was
the
barrier
stage
of
the
journey
a
distance
of
miles
statute
as
actually
run
on
our
the
weekly
units
of
food
were
to
carry
the
polar
party
and
two
supporting
parties
forward
to
their
farthest
point
and
back
again
to
the
bottom
of
the
beardmore
where
three
more
units
were
to
be
left
in
a
depôt
all
went
well
this
first
day
on
the
barrier
and
encouraging
messages
left
on
empty
petrol
drums
told
us
that
the
motors
were
going
well
when
they
passed
but
the
next
day
we
passed
five
petrol
drums
which
had
been
dumped
this
meant
that
there
was
trouble
and
some
miles
from
hut
point
we
learned
that
the
big
end
of
the
no
cylinder
of
day
motor
had
broken
and
half
a
mile
beyond
we
found
the
motor
itself
drifted
up
with
snow
and
looking
a
mournful
wreck
the
next
day
march
sunday
november
brought
us
to
corner
camp
there
were
a
few
legs
down
crevasses
during
the
day
but
nothing
to
worry
about
from
here
we
could
see
to
the
south
an
ominous
mark
in
the
snow
which
we
hoped
might
not
prove
to
be
the
second
motor
it
was
the
big
end
of
no
cylinder
had
cracked
the
machine
otherwise
in
good
order
evidently
the
engines
are
not
fitted
to
working
in
this
climate
a
fact
that
should
be
certainly
capable
of
correction
one
thing
is
proved
the
system
of
propulsion
is
altogether
satisfactory
and
again
it
is
a
disappointment
i
had
hoped
better
of
the
machines
once
they
got
away
on
the
barrier
surface
scott
had
set
his
heart
upon
the
success
of
the
motors
he
had
run
them
in
norway
and
switzerland
and
everything
was
done
that
care
and
forethought
could
suggest
at
the
back
of
his
mind
i
feel
sure
was
the
wish
to
abolish
the
cruelty
which
the
use
of
ponies
and
dogs
necessarily
entails
a
small
measure
of
success
will
be
enough
to
show
their
possibilities
their
ability
to
revolutionize
polar
transport
seeing
the
machines
at
work
leaving
cape
evans
and
remembering
that
every
defect
so
far
shown
is
purely
mechanical
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
convinced
of
their
value
but
the
trifling
mechanical
defects
and
lack
of
experience
show
the
risk
of
cutting
out
trials
a
season
of
experiment
with
a
small
workshop
at
hand
may
be
all
that
stands
between
success
and
failure
i
do
not
believe
that
scott
built
high
hopes
on
these
motors
but
it
was
a
chance
to
help
those
who
followed
him
scott
was
always
trying
to
do
that
did
they
succeed
or
fail
they
certainly
did
not
help
us
much
the
motor
which
travelled
farthest
drawing
a
heavy
load
to
just
beyond
corner
camp
but
even
so
fifty
statute
miles
is
fifty
miles
and
that
they
did
it
at
all
was
an
enormous
advance
the
distance
travelled
included
hard
and
soft
surfaces
and
we
found
later
when
the
snow
bridges
fell
in
during
the
summer
that
this
car
had
crossed
safely
some
broad
crevasses
also
they
worked
in
temperatures
down
to
fahr
all
this
was
to
the
good
for
no
machine
had
travelled
on
the
barrier
before
the
general
design
seemed
to
be
right
all
that
was
now
wanted
was
experience
as
an
experiment
they
were
successful
in
the
south
but
scott
never
knew
their
true
possibilities
for
they
were
the
direct
ancestors
of
the
in
france
had
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
ponies
were
pulling
in
the
colder
part
of
the
day
and
resting
in
the
warm
which
was
good
their
coats
dried
well
in
the
sun
and
after
a
few
days
to
get
accustomed
to
the
new
conditions
they
slept
and
fed
in
comparative
comfort
on
the
other
hand
the
pulling
surface
was
undoubtedly
better
when
the
sun
was
high
and
the
temperature
warmer
taking
one
thing
with
another
there
was
no
doubt
that
was
better
for
ponies
but
we
seldom
if
ever
tried
it
illustration
camp
on
the
barrier
wilson
del
just
now
there
was
an
amazing
difference
between
day
and
night
conditions
at
midnight
one
was
making
short
work
of
everything
nursing
fingers
after
doing
up
harness
with
minus
temperatures
and
nasty
cold
winds
by
supper
time
the
next
morning
we
were
sitting
on
our
sledges
writing
up
our
diaries
or
meteorological
logs
and
even
dabbling
our
bare
toes
in
the
snow
but
not
for
long
shades
of
darkness
how
different
all
this
was
from
what
we
had
been
through
my
personal
impression
of
this
early
summer
sledging
on
the
barrier
was
one
of
constant
wonder
at
its
comfort
one
had
forgotten
that
a
tent
could
be
warm
and
a
dry
so
deep
were
the
contrary
impressions
that
only
actual
experience
was
convincing
it
is
a
sweltering
day
the
air
breathless
the
glare
intense
one
loses
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
temperature
is
low
one
mind
seeks
comparison
in
hot
sunlit
streets
and
scorching
pavements
yet
six
hours
ago
my
thumb
was
all
the
inconveniences
of
frozen
footwear
and
damp
clothes
and
have
vanished
entirely
we
could
not
expect
to
get
through
this
windy
area
of
corner
camp
without
some
bad
weather
the
surface
improved
the
ponies
took
their
heavier
loads
with
ease
but
as
we
came
to
our
next
camp
it
was
banking
up
to
the
and
the
breeze
freshened
almost
immediately
we
built
pony
walls
hurriedly
and
by
the
time
we
had
finished
supper
it
was
blowing
force
november
camp
there
was
a
moderate
gale
with
some
drift
all
day
which
increased
to
force
with
more
drift
at
night
it
was
impossible
to
march
the
drift
took
off
a
bit
the
next
morning
and
meares
and
dimitri
with
the
two
appeared
and
camped
astern
of
us
this
was
according
to
previous
plan
by
which
the
were
to
start
after
us
and
catch
us
up
since
they
travelled
faster
than
the
ponies
the
snow
and
drift
necessitated
digging
out
ponies
again
and
again
to
keep
them
well
sheltered
from
the
wind
the
walls
made
a
splendid
lee
but
some
sledges
at
the
extremities
were
buried
altogether
and
our
tent
being
rather
close
to
windward
of
our
wall
got
the
back
eddy
and
was
continually
being
snowed
up
above
the
door
after
noon
the
snow
ceased
except
for
surface
drift
snatcher
knocked
his
section
of
the
wall
over
and
jehu
did
so
more
than
ever
all
ponies
looked
pretty
miserable
as
in
spite
of
the
shelter
they
were
bunged
up
eyes
and
all
in
drift
which
had
become
ice
and
could
not
be
removed
without
considerable
difficulty
towards
evening
it
ceased
drifting
altogether
but
a
wind
force
kept
up
with
disconcerting
regularity
eventually
atkinson
party
got
away
at
midnight
castle
rock
is
still
visible
but
will
be
closed
by
the
north
end
of
white
island
in
the
next
march
then
to
the
old
landmarks
for
many
a
long
day
the
next
day
november
started
at
midnight
and
had
a
very
pleasant
march
truly
sledging
in
such
weather
is
great
mounts
discovery
and
morning
which
we
gradually
closed
looked
fine
in
the
general
panorama
of
mountains
we
are
now
nearly
abreast
the
north
end
of
the
bluff
we
all
came
up
to
camp
together
this
morning
it
looked
like
a
meet
of
the
hounds
and
jehu
ran
away
the
next
march
was
just
the
opposite
wind
force
to
and
falling
snow
the
surface
was
very
slippery
in
parts
and
on
the
hard
sastrugi
it
was
a
case
of
falling
or
stumbling
continually
the
light
got
so
bad
that
one
might
have
been
walking
in
the
clouds
for
all
that
could
be
discerned
and
yet
it
was
only
snowing
slightly
the
bluff
became
completely
obscured
and
the
usual
signs
of
a
blizzard
were
accentuated
at
lunch
camp
scott
packed
up
and
followed
us
we
overhauled
atkinson
about
hours
later
he
having
camped
and
we
were
not
sorry
as
in
addition
to
marching
against
a
fresh
southerly
breeze
the
light
brought
a
tremendous
strain
on
the
eyes
in
following
tracks
a
little
more
than
eight
miles
for
the
day
total
we
carried
these
depressing
conditions
for
three
more
marches
that
is
till
the
morning
of
november
the
surface
was
wretched
the
weather
horrid
the
snow
persistent
covering
everything
with
soft
downy
flakes
inch
upon
inch
and
mile
upon
mile
there
are
glimpses
of
despondency
in
the
diaries
if
this
should
come
as
an
exception
our
luck
will
be
truly
awful
the
camp
is
very
silent
and
cheerless
signs
that
things
are
going
awry
the
weather
was
horrid
overcast
gloomy
snowy
spirits
became
very
low
i
expected
these
marches
to
be
a
little
difficult
but
not
near
so
bad
as
indefinite
conditions
always
tried
scott
most
positive
disasters
put
him
into
more
cheerful
spirits
than
most
in
the
big
gale
coming
south
when
the
ship
nearly
sank
and
when
we
lost
one
of
the
cherished
motors
through
the
his
was
one
of
the
few
cheerful
faces
i
saw
even
when
the
ship
ran
aground
off
cape
evans
he
was
not
despondent
but
this
kind
of
thing
irked
him
bowers
wrote
the
unpleasant
weather
and
bad
surface
and
chinaman
indisposition
combined
to
make
the
outlook
unpleasant
and
on
arrival
in
camp
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
scott
had
a
grievance
he
felt
that
in
arranging
the
consumption
of
forage
his
own
unit
had
not
been
favoured
with
the
same
reduction
as
ours
in
fact
accused
me
of
putting
upon
his
three
horses
to
save
my
own
we
went
through
the
weights
in
detail
after
our
meal
and
after
a
certain
amount
of
argument
decided
to
carry
on
as
we
were
going
i
can
quite
understand
his
feelings
and
after
our
experience
of
last
year
a
bad
day
like
this
makes
him
fear
our
beasts
are
going
to
fail
us
the
talent
the
doctors
examined
chinaman
who
begins
to
show
signs
of
wear
poor
ancient
little
beggar
he
ought
to
be
a
pensioner
instead
of
finishing
his
days
on
a
job
of
this
sort
jehu
looks
pretty
rocky
too
but
seeing
that
we
did
not
expect
him
to
reach
the
glacier
tongue
and
that
he
has
now
done
more
than
miles
from
cape
evans
one
really
does
not
know
what
to
expect
of
these
creatures
certainly
titus
thinks
as
he
has
always
said
that
they
are
the
most
unsuitable
crowd
of
unfit
creatures
that
could
possibly
be
got
together
the
weather
was
about
as
poisonous
as
one
could
wish
a
fresh
breeze
and
driving
snow
from
the
with
an
awful
surface
the
recently
fallen
snow
thickly
covered
the
ground
with
powdery
stuff
that
the
unfortunate
ponies
fairly
wallowed
in
if
it
was
only
ourselves
to
consider
i
should
not
mind
a
bit
but
to
see
our
best
ponies
being
hit
like
this
at
the
start
is
most
distressing
a
single
march
like
that
of
last
night
must
shorten
their
usefulness
by
days
and
here
we
are
a
fortnight
out
and
barely
of
the
distance
to
the
glacier
covered
with
every
pony
showing
signs
of
wear
victor
looks
a
lean
and
lanky
beast
compared
with
his
condition
two
weeks
ago
but
the
ponies
began
to
go
better
and
it
was
about
this
time
that
jehu
was
styled
the
barrier
wonder
and
chinaman
the
thunderbolt
our
four
ponies
have
suffered
most
writes
bowers
i
do
agree
with
titus
that
it
is
best
to
march
them
right
through
without
a
lunch
camp
they
were
undoubtedly
pretty
tired
and
worst
of
all
did
not
go
their
feeds
properly
it
was
a
fine
warm
morning
for
them
our
warmest
temperature
hitherto
in
the
afternoon
it
came
on
to
snow
in
large
flakes
like
one
would
get
at
home
i
have
never
seen
such
snow
down
here
before
it
makes
the
surface
very
bad
for
the
sledges
the
manes
and
rugs
were
covered
in
little
knots
of
ice
the
next
march
november
was
rather
better
though
the
going
was
very
deep
and
heavy
and
all
the
ponies
were
showing
signs
of
wear
and
tear
this
was
followed
by
a
delightfully
warm
day
and
all
the
animals
were
standing
drowsily
in
the
sunshine
we
could
see
the
land
far
away
behind
us
the
first
sight
of
land
we
had
had
for
many
days
on
november
we
reached
one
ton
depôt
having
travelled
a
hundred
and
thirty
miles
from
hut
point
the
two
sledges
left
standing
were
still
upright
and
the
tattered
remains
of
a
flag
flapped
over
the
main
cairn
in
a
salt
tin
lashed
to
the
bamboo
was
a
note
from
lieutenant
evans
to
say
that
he
had
gone
on
with
the
motor
party
five
days
before
and
would
continue
to
and
await
us
there
he
has
done
something
over
miles
in
days
exceedingly
good
going
we
dug
out
the
cairn
which
we
found
just
as
we
had
left
it
except
that
there
was
a
big
tongue
of
drift
level
with
the
top
of
the
cairn
to
leeward
and
running
about
yards
to
showing
that
the
prevailing
wind
here
is
nine
months
before
we
had
sprinkled
some
oats
on
the
surface
of
the
snow
hoping
to
get
a
measurement
of
the
accretion
of
snow
during
the
winter
unfortunately
we
were
unable
to
find
the
oats
again
but
other
evidence
went
to
show
that
the
snow
deposit
was
very
small
a
minimum
thermometer
which
was
lashed
with
great
care
to
a
framework
registered
after
the
temperatures
already
experienced
by
us
on
the
barrier
during
the
winter
and
spring
this
was
surprisingly
high
especially
as
our
minimum
temperatures
were
taken
under
the
sledge
which
means
that
the
thermometer
is
shaded
from
radiation
while
this
thermometer
at
one
ton
was
left
open
to
the
sky
on
the
winter
journey
we
found
that
a
shaded
thermometer
registered
when
an
unshaded
one
registered
a
difference
of
all
the
provisions
left
here
were
found
to
be
in
excellent
condition
we
then
had
a
prolonged
council
of
war
this
meant
that
scott
called
bowers
and
perhaps
oates
into
our
tent
after
supper
was
finished
in
the
morning
somehow
these
conferences
were
always
rather
on
this
occasion
as
was
usually
the
case
the
question
was
ponies
it
was
decided
to
wait
here
one
day
and
rest
them
as
there
was
ample
food
the
main
discussion
centred
round
the
amount
of
forage
to
be
taken
on
from
here
while
the
state
of
the
ponies
the
amount
they
could
pull
and
the
distance
they
could
go
had
to
be
taken
into
consideration
oates
thinks
the
ponies
will
get
through
but
that
they
have
lost
condition
quicker
than
he
expected
considering
his
usually
pessimistic
attitude
this
must
be
thought
a
hopeful
view
personally
i
am
much
more
hopeful
i
think
that
a
good
many
of
the
beasts
are
actually
in
better
form
than
when
they
started
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
be
alarmed
about
the
remainder
always
excepting
the
weak
ones
which
we
have
always
regarded
with
doubt
well
we
must
wait
and
see
how
things
go
the
decision
made
was
to
take
just
enough
food
to
get
the
ponies
to
the
glacier
allowing
for
the
killing
of
some
of
them
before
that
date
it
was
obvious
that
jehu
and
chinaman
could
not
go
very
much
farther
and
it
was
also
necessary
that
ponies
should
be
killed
in
order
to
feed
the
dogs
the
two
were
carrying
about
a
week
pony
food
but
they
were
unable
to
advance
more
than
a
fortnight
from
one
ton
without
killing
ponies
this
decision
practically
meant
that
scott
abandoned
the
idea
of
taking
ponies
up
the
glacier
this
was
a
great
relief
for
the
crevassed
state
of
the
lower
reaches
of
the
glacier
as
described
by
shackleton
led
us
to
believe
that
the
attempt
was
suicidal
all
the
winter
our
brains
were
exercised
to
try
and
devise
some
method
by
which
the
ponies
could
be
driven
from
behind
and
by
which
the
connection
between
pony
and
sledge
could
be
loosed
if
the
pony
fell
into
a
crevasse
but
i
confess
that
there
seemed
little
chance
of
this
happening
from
all
we
saw
of
the
glacier
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
no
reasonable
chance
of
getting
ponies
up
it
and
that
dogs
could
only
be
driven
down
it
if
the
way
up
was
most
carefully
surveyed
and
kept
on
the
return
i
am
sure
that
in
this
kind
of
uncertainty
the
mental
strain
on
the
leader
of
a
party
is
less
than
that
on
his
men
the
leader
knows
quite
well
what
he
thinks
worth
while
risking
or
not
in
this
case
scott
probably
was
always
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
not
be
worth
while
taking
ponies
on
to
the
glacier
the
pony
leaders
however
only
knew
that
the
possibility
was
ahead
of
them
i
can
remember
now
the
relief
with
which
we
heard
that
it
was
not
intended
that
wilson
should
take
nobby
the
fittest
of
our
ponies
farther
than
the
gateway
up
to
now
christopher
had
lived
up
to
his
reputation
as
the
following
extracts
from
bowers
diary
will
show
three
times
we
downed
him
and
he
got
up
and
threw
us
about
with
all
four
of
us
hanging
on
like
grim
death
he
nearly
had
me
under
him
once
he
seems
fearfully
strong
but
it
is
a
pity
he
wastes
so
much
good
energy
christopher
as
usual
was
strapped
on
three
legs
and
then
got
down
on
his
knees
he
gets
more
cunning
each
time
and
if
he
does
not
succeed
in
biting
or
kicking
one
of
us
before
long
it
wo
be
his
fault
he
finds
the
soft
snow
does
not
hurt
his
knees
like
the
and
so
plunges
about
on
them
one
finnesko
are
so
slippery
that
it
is
difficult
to
exert
full
strength
on
him
and
he
bowled
oates
over
and
got
away
altogether
fortunately
the
lashing
on
his
fourth
leg
held
fast
and
we
were
able
to
secure
him
when
he
rejoined
the
other
animals
finally
he
lay
down
and
thought
he
had
defeated
us
but
we
had
the
sledge
connected
up
by
that
time
and
as
he
got
up
we
rushed
him
forward
before
he
had
time
to
kick
over
the
traces
dimitri
came
and
gave
us
a
hand
with
chris
three
of
us
hung
on
to
him
while
the
other
two
connected
up
the
sledge
we
had
a
struggle
for
over
twenty
minutes
and
he
managed
to
tread
on
me
but
no
damage
done
got
chris
in
by
a
dodge
titus
did
away
with
his
back
strap
and
nearly
had
him
away
unaided
before
he
realized
that
the
hated
sledge
was
fast
to
him
unfortunately
he
started
off
just
too
soon
and
bolted
with
only
one
trace
fast
this
pivoted
him
to
starboard
and
he
charged
the
line
i
expected
a
but
he
stopped
at
the
wall
between
bones
and
snatcher
and
we
cast
off
and
cleared
sledge
before
trying
again
by
laying
the
traces
down
the
side
of
the
sledge
instead
of
ahead
we
got
him
off
his
guard
again
and
he
was
away
before
he
knew
what
had
occurred
we
had
a
bad
time
with
chris
again
he
remembered
having
been
bluffed
before
and
could
not
be
got
near
the
sledge
at
all
three
times
he
broke
away
but
fortunately
he
always
ran
back
among
the
other
ponies
and
not
out
on
to
the
barrier
finally
we
had
to
down
him
and
he
was
so
tired
with
his
recent
struggles
that
after
one
abortive
attempt
we
got
him
fast
and
away
meanwhile
it
was
not
so
much
the
difficulties
of
sledging
as
the
depressing
blank
conditions
in
which
our
march
was
so
often
made
that
gave
us
such
troubles
as
we
had
the
routine
of
a
tent
makes
a
lot
of
difference
scott
tent
was
a
comfortable
one
to
live
in
and
i
was
always
glad
when
i
was
told
to
join
it
and
sorry
to
leave
he
was
himself
extraordinarily
quick
and
no
time
was
ever
lost
by
his
party
in
camping
or
breaking
camp
he
was
most
careful
some
said
but
i
do
not
think
so
that
everything
should
be
neat
and
shipshape
and
there
was
a
recognized
place
for
everything
on
the
depôt
journey
we
were
bidden
to
see
that
every
particle
of
snow
was
beaten
off
our
clothing
and
finnesko
before
entering
the
tent
if
it
was
drifting
we
had
to
do
this
after
entering
and
the
snow
was
carefully
cleared
off
the
afterwards
each
tent
was
supplied
with
a
small
brush
with
which
to
perform
this
office
in
addition
to
other
obvious
advantages
this
materially
helped
to
keep
clothing
finnesko
and
dry
and
thus
prolong
the
life
of
furs
after
all
is
said
and
done
said
wilson
one
day
after
supper
the
best
sledger
is
the
man
who
sees
what
has
to
be
done
and
does
it
and
says
nothing
about
it
scott
agreed
and
if
you
were
sledging
with
the
owner
you
had
to
keep
your
eyes
wide
open
for
the
little
things
which
cropped
up
and
do
them
quickly
and
say
nothing
about
them
there
is
nothing
so
irritating
as
the
man
who
is
always
coming
in
and
informing
all
and
sundry
that
he
has
repaired
his
sledge
or
built
a
wall
or
filled
the
cooker
or
mended
his
socks
i
moved
into
scott
tent
for
the
first
time
in
the
middle
of
the
depôt
journey
and
was
enormously
impressed
by
the
comfort
which
a
careful
routine
of
this
nature
evoked
there
was
a
homelike
air
about
the
tent
at
supper
time
and
though
a
lunch
camp
in
the
middle
of
the
night
is
always
rather
bleak
there
was
never
anything
slovenly
another
thing
which
struck
me
even
more
forcibly
was
the
cooking
we
were
of
course
on
just
the
same
ration
as
the
tent
from
which
i
had
come
i
was
hungry
and
said
so
bad
cooking
said
wilson
shortly
and
so
it
was
for
in
two
or
three
days
the
sharpest
edge
was
off
my
hunger
wilson
and
scott
had
learned
many
a
cooking
tip
in
the
past
and
instead
of
the
same
old
meal
day
by
day
the
weekly
ration
was
so
manoeuvred
by
a
clever
cook
that
it
was
seldom
quite
the
same
meal
sometimes
pemmican
plain
or
thicker
pemmican
with
some
arrowroot
mixed
with
it
at
others
we
surrendered
a
biscuit
and
a
half
apiece
and
had
a
dry
hoosh
biscuit
fried
in
pemmican
with
a
little
water
added
and
a
good
big
cup
of
cocoa
to
follow
dry
hooshes
also
saved
oil
there
were
cocoa
and
tea
upon
which
to
ring
the
changes
or
better
still
which
combined
the
stimulating
qualities
of
tea
with
the
food
value
of
cocoa
then
much
could
be
done
with
the
of
raisins
which
was
our
daily
whack
they
were
good
soaked
in
the
tea
but
best
perhaps
in
with
the
biscuits
and
pemmican
as
a
dry
hoosh
you
are
going
far
to
earn
my
undying
gratitude
cherry
was
a
satisfied
remark
of
scott
one
evening
when
having
saved
unbeknownst
to
my
companions
some
of
their
daily
ration
of
cocoa
arrowroot
sugar
and
raisins
i
made
a
chocolate
hoosh
but
i
am
afraid
he
had
indigestion
next
morning
there
were
meals
when
we
had
interesting
little
talks
as
when
i
find
in
my
diary
that
we
had
a
jolly
lunch
meal
discussing
authors
barrie
galsworthy
and
others
are
personal
friends
of
scott
some
one
told
max
beerbohm
that
he
was
like
captain
scott
and
immediately
so
scott
assured
us
he
grew
a
beard
but
about
three
weeks
out
the
topics
of
conversation
became
threadbare
from
then
onwards
it
was
often
that
whole
days
passed
without
conversation
beyond
the
routine
camp
ho
all
ready
pack
up
spell
ho
the
latter
after
some
two
hours
pulling
when
we
used
to
start
pulling
immediately
we
had
the
tent
down
the
sledge
packed
and
our
harness
over
our
bodies
and
ski
on
our
feet
after
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
effects
of
the
marching
would
be
felt
in
the
warming
of
hands
and
feet
and
the
consequent
thawing
of
our
mitts
and
finnesko
we
then
halted
long
enough
for
everybody
to
adjust
their
ski
and
clothing
then
on
perhaps
for
two
hours
or
more
before
we
halted
again
since
it
had
been
decided
to
lighten
the
ponies
weights
we
left
at
least
lbs
of
pony
forage
behind
when
we
started
from
one
ton
on
the
night
of
november
on
our
first
march
this
was
a
distinct
saving
and
instead
of
lbs
each
with
which
the
six
stronger
ponies
left
corner
camp
they
now
pulled
only
lbs
jehu
had
only
lbs
and
chinaman
lbs
the
had
lbs
of
pony
food
between
them
and
according
to
plan
the
two
teams
were
to
carry
lbs
from
one
ton
between
them
these
weights
included
the
sledges
with
straps
and
fittings
which
weighed
about
lbs
summer
seemed
long
in
coming
for
we
marched
into
a
considerable
breeze
and
the
temperature
was
oates
and
seaman
evans
had
quite
a
crop
of
i
pointed
out
to
meares
that
his
nose
was
gone
but
he
left
it
saying
that
he
had
got
tired
of
it
and
it
would
thaw
out
by
and
by
the
ponies
were
going
better
for
their
rest
the
next
day
march
was
over
crusty
snow
with
a
layer
of
loose
powdery
snow
at
the
top
and
a
temperature
of
was
chilly
towards
the
end
of
it
scott
got
frightened
that
the
ponies
were
not
going
as
well
as
they
should
another
council
of
war
was
held
and
it
was
decided
that
an
average
of
thirteen
miles
a
day
must
be
done
at
all
costs
and
that
another
sack
of
forage
should
be
dumped
here
putting
the
ponies
on
short
rations
later
if
necessary
oates
agreed
but
said
the
ponies
were
going
better
than
he
expected
that
jehu
and
chinaman
might
go
a
week
and
almost
certainly
would
go
three
days
bowers
was
always
against
this
dumping
meanwhile
scott
wrote
it
touch
and
go
whether
we
scrape
up
to
the
glacier
meanwhile
we
get
along
somehow

del
as
a
result
of
one
of
christopher
tantrums
bowers
records
that
his
was
carried
away
this
morning
i
took
my
into
the
tent
after
breakfast
and
rigged
up
a
fancy
lashing
with
raw
hide
thongs
so
as
to
give
it
the
necessary
play
with
security
a
splendid
parhelia
exhibition
was
caused
by
the
round
the
sun
was
a
halo
that
is
a
halo
from
the
sun
image
with
four
mock
suns
in
rainbow
colours
and
outside
this
another
halo
in
complete
rainbow
colours
above
the
sun
were
the
arcs
of
two
other
circles
touching
these
halos
and
the
arcs
of
the
great
circle
could
be
seen
faintly
on
either
side
below
was
a
glare
of
white
which
contained
an
exaggerated
mock
sun
which
was
as
dazzling
as
the
sun
himself
altogether
a
fine
example
of
a
pretty
common
phenomenon
down
here
and
the
next
day
we
saw
the
party
ahead
in
inverted
mirage
some
distance
above
their
heads
in
the
next
three
marches
we
covered
our
daily
miles
for
the
most
part
without
very
great
difficulty
but
poor
jehu
was
in
a
bad
way
stopping
every
few
hundred
yards
it
was
a
funereal
business
for
the
leaders
of
these
crock
ponies
and
at
this
stage
of
the
journey
atkinson
wright
and
keohane
had
many
more
difficulties
than
most
of
us
and
the
success
of
their
ponies
was
largely
due
to
their
patience
and
care
incidentally
big
icicles
formed
upon
the
ponies
noses
during
the
march
and
chinaman
used
wright
windproof
blouse
as
a
handkerchief
during
the
last
of
these
marches
that
is
on
the
morning
of
november
we
saw
a
massive
cairn
ahead
and
found
there
the
motor
party
consisting
of
lieutenant
evans
day
lashly
and
hooper
the
cairn
was
in
and
under
the
name
mount
hooper
formed
our
upper
barrier
depôt
we
left
there
three
s
summit
rations
two
cases
of
emergency
biscuits
and
two
cases
of
oil
which
constituted
three
weekly
food
units
for
the
three
parties
which
were
to
advance
from
the
bottom
of
the
beardmore
glacier
this
food
was
to
take
them
back
from
to
one
ton
camp
we
all
camped
for
the
night
miles
farther
on
sixteen
men
five
tents
ten
ponies
dogs
and
thirteen
sledges
the
party
had
been
waiting
for
six
days
and
having
expected
us
before
were
getting
anxious
about
us
they
declared
that
they
were
very
hungry
and
day
who
was
always
long
and
thin
looked
quite
gaunt
some
spare
biscuits
which
we
gave
them
from
our
tent
were
carried
off
with
gratitude
the
rest
of
us
who
were
driving
dogs
or
leading
ponies
still
found
our
barrier
ration
satisfying
we
had
now
been
out
three
weeks
and
had
travelled
miles
and
formed
a
very
good
idea
as
to
what
the
ponies
could
do
the
crocks
had
done
wonderfully
we
hope
jehu
will
last
three
days
he
will
then
be
finished
in
any
case
and
fed
to
the
dogs
it
is
amusing
to
see
meares
looking
eagerly
for
the
chance
of
a
feed
for
his
animals
he
has
been
expecting
it
daily
on
the
other
hand
atkinson
and
oates
are
eager
to
get
the
poor
animal
beyond
the
point
at
which
shackleton
killed
his
first
beast
reports
on
chinaman
are
very
favourable
and
it
really
looks
as
though
the
ponies
are
going
to
do
what
is
hoped
of
them
from
first
to
last
nobby
who
was
rescued
from
the
floe
was
the
strongest
pony
we
had
and
was
now
drawing
a
heavier
load
than
any
other
pony
by
lbs
he
was
a
contented
kind
of
animal
misnamed
a
pony
indeed
several
of
our
beasts
were
too
large
to
fit
this
description
christopher
of
course
was
wearing
himself
out
quicker
than
most
but
all
of
them
had
lost
a
lot
of
weight
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
all
the
oats
and
they
could
eat
bowers
writes
of
his
pony
victor
my
pony
has
taken
to
leading
the
line
like
his
opposite
number
last
season
he
is
a
steady
goer
and
as
gentle
as
a
dear
old
sheep
i
can
hardly
realize
the
strenuous
times
i
had
with
him
only
a
month
ago
when
it
took
about
four
of
us
to
get
him
harnessed
to
a
sledge
and
two
of
us
every
time
with
all
our
strength
to
keep
him
from
bolting
when
in
it
even
at
the
start
of
the
journey
he
was
as
nearly
unmanageable
as
any
beast
could
be
and
always
liable
to
bolt
from
sheer
excess
of
spirits
he
is
more
sober
now
after
three
weeks
of
featureless
barrier
but
i
think
i
am
more
fond
of
him
than
ever
he
has
lost
his
rotundity
like
all
the
other
horses
and
is
a
angular
beast
very
ugly
as
horses
go
but
still
i
would
not
change
him
for
any
other
the
ponies
were
fed
by
their
leaders
at
the
lunch
and
supper
halts
and
by
oates
and
bowers
during
the
sleep
halt
about
four
hours
before
we
marched
several
of
them
developed
a
troublesome
habit
of
swinging
their
nosebags
off
some
as
soon
as
they
were
put
on
others
in
their
anxiety
to
reach
the
corn
still
left
uneaten
in
the
bottom
of
the
bag
we
had
to
lash
their
bags
on
to
their
headstalls
victor
got
hold
of
his
head
rope
yesterday
and
devoured
it
not
because
he
is
hungry
as
he
wo
eat
all
his
allowance
even
now
the
original
intention
was
that
day
and
hooper
should
return
from
but
it
was
now
decided
that
their
unit
of
four
should
remain
intact
for
a
few
days
and
constitute
a
light
advance
party
to
make
the
track
the
weather
was
much
more
pleasant
and
we
saw
the
sun
most
days
while
i
note
only
one
temperature
below
since
leaving
one
ton
the
ponies
sank
in
a
cruel
distance
some
days
but
we
were
certainly
not
overworking
them
and
they
had
as
much
food
as
they
could
eat
we
knew
the
grim
part
was
to
come
but
we
never
realized
how
grim
it
was
to
be
from
this
northern
barrier
depôt
the
ponies
were
mostly
drawing
less
than
lbs
and
we
had
hopes
of
getting
through
to
the
glacier
without
much
difficulty
all
depended
on
the
weather
and
just
now
it
was
glorious
and
the
ponies
were
going
steadily
together
jehu
the
crockiest
of
the
crocks
was
led
back
along
the
track
and
shot
on
the
evening
of
november
having
reached
a
point
at
least
miles
beyond
that
where
shackleton
shot
his
first
pony
when
it
is
considered
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
he
could
start
at
all
this
must
be
conceded
to
have
been
a
triumph
of
in
which
both
oates
and
atkinson
shared
though
neither
so
much
as
jehu
himself
for
he
must
have
had
a
good
spirit
to
have
dragged
his
poor
body
so
far
a
year
care
and
good
feeding
three
weeks
work
with
good
treatment
a
reasonable
load
and
a
good
ration
and
then
a
painless
end
if
anybody
can
call
that
cruel
i
can
not
either
understand
it
or
agree
with
them
thus
bowers
who
continues
the
midnight
sun
reflected
from
the
snow
has
started
to
burn
my
face
and
lips
i
smear
them
with
hazeline
before
turning
in
and
find
it
a
good
thing
wearing
goggles
has
absolutely
prevented
any
recurrence
of
captain
scott
says
they
make
me
see
everything
through
spectacles
we
said
to
day
and
hooper
next
morning
and
they
set
their
faces
northwards
and
homewards
parties
on
the
barrier
are
not
much
fun
day
had
certainly
done
his
best
about
the
motors
and
they
had
helped
us
over
a
bad
bit
of
initial
surface
that
night
scott
wrote
only
a
few
more
marches
to
feel
safe
in
getting
to
our
goal
at
the
lunch
halt
on
november
in
lat
we
left
our
middle
barrier
depôt
containing
one
week
provisions
for
each
returning
unit
as
at
mount
hooper
a
reduction
of
lbs
in
our
weights
the
march
that
day
was
very
trying
it
is
always
rather
dismal
work
walking
over
the
great
snow
plain
when
sky
and
surface
merge
in
one
pall
of
dead
whiteness
but
it
is
cheering
to
be
in
such
good
company
with
everything
going
on
steadily
and
well
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
animals
were
tiring
and
a
tired
animal
makes
a
tired
man
i
find
the
next
day
november
was
no
better
the
most
dismal
start
imaginable
thick
as
a
hedge
snow
falling
and
drifting
with
keen
southerly
wind
bowers
notes
we
have
now
run
down
a
whole
degree
of
latitude
without
a
fine
day
or
anything
but
clouds
mist
and
driving
snow
from
the
south
we
certainly
did
have
some
difficult
marches
one
of
the
worst
effects
of
which
was
that
we
knew
we
must
be
making
a
winding
course
and
we
had
to
pick
up
our
depôts
on
the
return
somehow
here
is
a
typical
bad
morning
from
bowers
diary
the
first
four
miles
of
the
march
were
utter
misery
for
me
as
victor
either
through
lassitude
or
because
he
did
not
like
having
to
plug
into
the
wind
went
as
slow
as
a
funeral
horse
the
light
was
so
bad
that
wearing
goggles
was
most
necessary
and
the
driving
snow
filled
them
up
as
fast
as
you
cleared
them
i
dropped
a
long
way
astern
of
the
cavalcade
could
hardly
see
them
at
times
through
the
snow
but
the
fear
that
victor
of
all
the
beasts
should
give
out
was
like
a
nightmare
i
have
always
been
used
to
starting
later
than
the
others
by
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
catching
them
up
at
the
cairn
i
was
about
fed
up
to
the
neck
with
it
but
i
said
very
little
as
everybody
was
so
disgusted
with
the
weather
and
things
in
general
that
i
saw
that
i
was
not
the
only
one
in
tribulation
victor
turned
up
trumps
after
that
he
stepped
out
and
led
the
line
in
his
old
place
and
at
a
good
swinging
pace
considering
the
surface
my
temper
and
spirits
improving
at
every
step
in
the
afternoon
he
went
splendidly
again
and
finished
up
by
rolling
in
the
snow
when
i
had
taken
his
harness
off
a
thing
he
has
not
done
for
ten
or
twelve
days
it
certainly
does
not
look
like
exhaustion
indeed
these
days
we
were
fighting
for
our
marches
and
chinaman
who
was
killed
this
night
seemed
well
out
of
it
he
reached
a
point
less
than
miles
from
the
glacier
though
this
was
small
comfort
to
him
stumbling
and
groping
our
way
along
as
we
had
been
during
the
last
blizzard
we
were
totally
unprepared
for
the
sight
which
met
us
during
our
next
march
on
november
the
great
ramp
of
mountains
which
ran
to
the
west
of
us
and
would
soon
bar
our
way
to
the
south
partly
cleared
and
right
on
top
of
us
it
seemed
were
the
triple
peaks
of
mount
markham
after
some
miles
of
bleak
monotonous
barrier
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
indeed
we
camped
at
night
in
latitude
four
miles
beyond
scott
previous
farthest
south
in
then
they
had
the
best
of
luck
in
clear
fine
weather
which
shackleton
has
also
recorded
at
this
stage
of
his
southern
journey
it
is
curious
to
see
how
depressed
all
our
diaries
become
when
this
bad
weather
obtained
and
how
quickly
we
must
have
cheered
up
whenever
the
sun
came
out
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
similar
effect
was
produced
upon
the
ponies
truth
to
tell
the
mental
strain
upon
those
responsible
was
very
great
in
these
early
days
and
there
is
little
of
outside
interest
to
relieve
the
mind
the
crystal
surface
which
was
an
invisible
carpet
yesterday
becomes
a
shining
glorious
sheet
of
many
colours
the
irregularities
which
caused
you
so
many
falls
are
now
quite
clear
and
you
step
on
or
over
them
without
a
thought
and
when
there
is
added
some
of
the
most
wonderful
scenery
in
the
world
it
is
hard
to
recall
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
present
how
irritable
and
weary
you
felt
only
twenty
hours
ago
the
whisper
of
the
sledge
the
hiss
of
the
primus
the
smell
of
the
hoosh
and
the
soft
folds
of
your
how
jolly
they
can
all
be
and
generally
were
i
would
that
i
could
once
again
around
the
cooker
sit
and
hearken
to
its
soft
refrain
and
feel
so
jolly
fit
instead
of
silken
chains
the
uneventful
round
i
long
to
be
mid
plains
in
harness
outward
bound
with
the
pad
pad
pad
of
feet
with
two
hundred
pounds
per
man
not
enough
hoosh
or
biscuit
to
eat
well
done
lads
up
tent
outspan
nelson
in
south
polar
certainly
as
we
skirted
these
mountains
range
upon
range
during
the
next
two
marches
november
and
december
we
felt
we
could
have
little
cause
for
complaint
they
brought
us
to
lat
and
here
we
left
our
last
depôt
on
the
barrier
called
the
southern
barrier
depôt
with
a
week
ration
for
each
returning
party
as
usual
the
man
food
is
enough
for
one
week
for
each
returning
unit
of
four
men
the
next
depôt
beyond
being
the
middle
barrier
depôt
miles
north
as
we
ought
easily
to
do
over
miles
a
week
on
the
return
journey
there
is
little
likelihood
of
our
having
to
go
on
short
commons
if
all
goes
well
and
this
was
what
we
all
felt
until
we
found
the
polar
party
this
was
our
camp
and
we
had
been
out
a
month
illustration
the
mountains
which
lie
between
the
barrier
and
the
plateau
as
seen
on
december
from
the
drawings
by
wilson
emery
walker
limited
collotypers
it
was
important
that
we
should
have
fine
clear
weather
during
the
next
few
days
when
we
should
be
approaching
the
land
on
his
previous
southern
journey
scott
had
been
prevented
from
reaching
the
range
of
mountains
which
ran
along
to
our
right
by
a
huge
chasm
this
phenomenon
is
known
to
geologists
as
a
shear
crack
and
is
formed
by
the
movement
of
a
glacier
away
from
the
land
which
bounds
it
in
this
case
a
mass
of
many
hundred
miles
of
barrier
has
moved
away
from
the
mountains
and
the
disturbance
is
correspondingly
great
shackleton
has
described
how
he
approached
the
gateway
as
he
named
the
passage
between
mount
hope
and
the
mainland
by
means
of
which
he
passed
through
on
to
the
beardmore
glacier
as
he
and
his
companions
were
exploring
the
way
they
came
upon
an
enormous
chasm
feet
wide
and
feet
deep
which
barred
their
path
moving
along
to
the
right
they
found
a
place
where
the
chasm
was
filled
with
snow
and
here
they
crossed
to
the
land
some
miles
ahead
at
our
southern
barrier
depôt
we
reckoned
we
were
some
miles
from
this
gateway
and
in
three
more
marches
we
hoped
to
be
camped
under
this
land
christopher
was
shot
at
the
depôt
he
was
the
only
pony
who
did
not
die
instantaneously
perhaps
oates
was
not
so
calm
as
usual
for
chris
was
his
own
horse
though
such
a
brute
just
as
oates
fired
he
moved
and
charged
into
the
camp
with
the
bullet
in
his
head
he
was
caught
with
difficulty
nearly
giving
keohane
a
bad
bite
led
back
and
finished
we
were
well
rid
of
him
while
he
was
strong
he
fought
and
once
the
barrier
had
tamed
him
as
we
were
not
able
to
do
he
never
pulled
a
fair
load
he
could
have
gone
several
more
days
but
there
was
not
enough
pony
food
to
take
all
the
animals
forward
we
began
to
wonder
if
we
had
done
right
to
leave
so
much
behind
each
pony
provided
at
least
four
days
food
for
the
some
of
them
more
and
there
was
quite
a
lot
of
fat
on
them
even
on
jehu
this
was
comforting
as
going
to
prove
that
their
hardships
were
not
too
great
also
we
put
the
undercut
into
our
own
hoosh
and
it
was
very
good
though
we
had
little
oil
to
cook
it
we
had
been
starting
later
each
night
in
order
that
the
transition
from
night
to
day
marching
might
be
gradual
for
we
intended
to
march
by
day
when
we
started
pulling
up
the
glacier
and
there
were
no
ponies
to
rest
when
the
sun
was
high
it
may
be
said
therefore
that
our
next
march
was
on
december
before
we
started
scott
walked
over
to
bowers
i
have
come
to
a
decision
which
will
shock
you
victor
was
to
go
at
the
end
of
the
march
because
pony
food
was
running
so
short
birdie
wrote
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
did
a
splendid
march
and
kept
ahead
all
day
and
as
usual
marched
into
camp
first
pulling
over
lbs
easily
it
seemed
an
awful
pity
to
have
to
shoot
a
great
strong
animal
and
it
seemed
like
the
irony
of
fate
to
me
as
i
had
been
downed
for
the
ponies
with
needless
excess
of
food
and
the
drastic
reductions
had
been
made
against
my
strenuous
opposition
up
to
the
last
it
is
poor
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
that
i
was
right
now
that
my
horse
is
dead
good
old
victor
he
has
always
had
a
biscuit
out
of
my
ration
and
he
ate
his
last
before
the
bullet
sent
him
to
his
rest
here
ends
my
second
horse
in
not
quite
so
tragically
as
my
first
when
the
broke
up
but
none
the
less
i
feel
sorry
for
a
beast
that
has
been
my
constant
companion
and
care
for
so
long
he
has
done
his
share
in
our
undertaking
anyhow
and
may
i
do
my
share
as
well
when
i
get
into
harness
myself
the
snow
has
started
to
fall
over
his
bleak
and
it
looks
like
a
blizzard
the
outlook
is
dark
stormy
and
threatening
indeed
it
had
been
a
dismal
march
into
a
blank
white
wall
and
the
ponies
were
sinking
badly
in
the
snow
leaving
holes
a
full
foot
deep
the
temperature
was
and
the
flakes
of
snow
melted
when
they
lay
on
the
dark
colours
of
the
tents
and
our
furs
after
building
the
pony
walls
water
was
running
down
our
windproofs
i
note
we
are
doing
well
on
pony
meat
and
go
to
bed
very
content
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
could
not
do
more
than
heat
the
meat
by
throwing
it
into
the
pemmican
we
found
it
sweet
and
good
though
tough
the
party
consisted
of
lieut
evans
and
lashly
who
had
lost
their
motors
and
atkinson
and
wright
who
had
lost
their
ponies
they
were
really
quite
hungry
by
now
and
most
of
us
pretty
well
looked
forward
to
our
meals
and
kept
a
biscuit
to
eat
in
our
bags
if
we
could
the
pony
meat
therefore
came
as
a
relief
i
think
we
ought
to
have
depôted
more
of
it
on
the
cairns
as
it
was
what
we
did
not
eat
was
given
to
the
dogs
with
some
tins
of
extra
oil
and
a
depôted
pony
the
polar
party
would
probably
have
got
home
in
safety
on
december
we
roused
out
at
it
was
thick
and
snowy
as
we
breakfasted
the
blizzard
started
from
the
and
was
soon
blowing
force
a
full
gale
with
heavy
drift
the
strongest
wind
i
have
known
here
in
summer
it
was
impossible
to
start
but
we
turned
out
and
made
up
the
pony
walls
in
heavy
drift
one
of
them
being
blown
down
three
times
by
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
land
was
clear
we
started
at
with
what
we
thought
was
mount
hope
showing
up
ahead
but
soon
great
were
banking
up
and
in
two
hours
we
were
walking
in
a
deep
gloom
which
made
it
difficult
to
find
the
track
made
by
the
party
ahead
by
the
time
we
reached
the
cairn
which
was
always
built
at
the
end
of
the
first
four
miles
it
was
blowing
hard
from
the
of
all
the
unlikely
quarters
of
the
compass
bowers
and
scott
were
on
ski
i
put
on
my
windproof
blouse
and
nosed
out
the
track
for
two
miles
when
we
suddenly
came
upon
the
tent
of
the
leading
party
they
had
camped
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
steering
a
course
in
such
thick
weather
the
ponies
however
with
the
wind
abaft
the
beam
were
going
along
splendidly
and
scott
thought
it
worth
while
to
shove
on
we
therefore
carried
on
another
four
miles
making
ten
in
all
a
good
half
march
before
we
camped
on
ski
it
was
simply
ripping
except
for
the
inability
to
see
anything
at
all
with
the
wind
behind
and
the
good
sliding
surface
made
by
the
snow
one
fairly
slithered
along
camping
was
less
pleasant
as
it
was
blowing
a
gale
by
that
time
we
are
all
in
our
bags
again
now
with
a
good
hot
meal
inside
one
and
blow
high
or
blow
low
one
might
be
in
a
worse
place
than
a
reindeer
bag
it
was
all
right
for
the
people
on
ski
and
this
in
itself
gave
us
a
certain
sense
of
grievance
but
things
had
not
been
so
easy
with
the
ponies
who
were
sinking
very
deeply
in
places
while
we
ourselves
were
sinking
well
over
our
ankles
this
day
we
began
to
cross
the
great
undulations
in
the
barrier
with
the
crests
some
mile
apart
which
here
mark
the
approach
to
the
land
we
had
built
the
walls
to
the
north
of
the
ponies
on
camping
because
the
wind
was
from
that
direction
but
by
breakfast
on
december
it
was
blowing
a
thick
blizzard
from
the
we
began
to
feel
bewildered
by
these
extraordinary
weather
changes
and
not
a
little
exasperated
too
again
we
could
not
march
and
again
we
had
to
dig
out
the
sledges
and
ponies
and
to
move
them
all
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
walls
which
we
had
partly
to
rebuild
oh
for
the
simple
life
was
our
thought
and
poor
helpless
beasts
this
is
no
country
for
live
stock
by
this
time
we
could
not
see
the
neighbouring
tents
for
the
drift
the
situation
was
not
improved
by
the
fact
that
our
tent
doors
the
tents
having
been
pitched
for
the
strong
north
wind
then
blowing
were
now
facing
the
blizzard
and
sheets
of
snow
entered
with
each
individual
the
party
came
up
just
before
the
worst
of
the
blizzard
started
the
dogs
alone
were
comfortable
buried
deep
beneath
the
drifted
snow
the
sailors
began
to
debate
who
was
the
jonah
they
said
he
was
the
cameras
the
great
blizzard
was
brewing
all
about
us
but
at
as
though
a
curtain
was
rolled
back
the
thick
snow
fog
cleared
off
while
at
the
same
time
the
wind
fell
calm
and
a
great
mountain
appeared
almost
on
the
top
of
us
far
away
to
the
we
could
distinguish
by
looking
very
carefully
a
break
in
the
level
barrier
horizon
a
new
mountain
which
we
reckoned
must
be
at
least
in
latitude
and
very
high
towards
it
the
ranges
stretched
away
peak
upon
peak
range
upon
range
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
mountains
surpassed
anything
i
have
ever
seen
beside
the
least
of
these
giants
ben
nevis
would
be
a
mere
mound
and
yet
they
are
so
immense
as
to
dwarf
each
other
they
are
intersected
at
every
turn
with
mighty
glaciers
and
and
eternally
valleys
that
defy
description
so
clear
was
everything
that
every
rock
seemed
to
stand
out
and
the
effect
of
the
sun
as
he
came
round
between
us
and
the
mountains
was
to
make
the
scene
still
more
beautiful
altogether
we
marched
eleven
miles
this
day
and
camped
right
in
front
of
the
gateway
which
we
reckoned
to
be
some
thirteen
miles
away
we
saw
no
crevasses
but
crossed
ten
or
twelve
very
large
undulations
and
estimated
that
the
dips
between
them
were
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
mount
hope
was
bigger
than
we
expected
and
beyond
it
stretching
out
into
the
barrier
as
far
as
we
could
see
was
a
great
white
line
of
jagged
edges
the
chaos
of
pressure
which
this
vast
glacier
makes
as
it
flows
into
the
comparatively
stationary
ice
of
the
barrier
my
own
pony
michael
was
shot
after
we
came
into
camp
he
was
as
attractive
a
little
beast
as
we
had
his
light
weight
helped
him
on
soft
surfaces
but
his
small
hoofs
let
him
in
farther
than
most
and
i
notice
in
scott
diary
that
on
november
the
ponies
were
sinking
to
the
hock
and
michael
once
or
twice
almost
to
the
hock
itself
a
highly
strung
spirited
animal
his
off
days
took
the
form
of
fidgets
during
which
he
would
be
constantly
trying
to
stop
and
eat
snow
and
then
rush
forward
to
catch
up
the
other
ponies
life
was
a
constant
source
of
wonder
to
him
and
no
movement
in
the
camp
escaped
his
notice
before
we
had
been
long
on
the
barrier
he
developed
mischievous
habits
and
became
a
rope
eater
and
gnawer
of
other
ponies
fringes
as
we
called
the
coloured
tassels
we
hung
over
their
eyes
to
ward
off
however
he
was
by
no
means
the
only
culprit
and
he
lost
his
own
fringe
to
nobby
quite
early
in
the
proceedings
it
was
not
that
he
was
hungry
for
he
never
quite
finished
his
own
feed
at
any
rate
he
enjoyed
the
few
weeks
before
he
died
pricking
up
his
ears
and
getting
quite
excited
when
anything
happened
and
the
arrival
of
the
each
morning
after
he
had
been
tethered
sent
him
to
bed
with
much
to
dream
of
and
i
must
say
his
master
dreamed
pretty
regularly
too
michael
was
killed
right
in
front
of
the
gateway
on
december
just
before
the
big
blizzard
which
though
we
did
not
know
it
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
upon
us
and
he
was
untying
his
cloth
and
chewing
up
everything
he
could
reach
to
the
last
it
was
decided
after
we
camped
and
he
had
his
feed
already
on
meares
reported
that
he
had
no
more
food
for
the
dogs
he
walked
away
and
rolled
in
the
snow
on
the
way
down
not
having
done
so
when
we
got
in
he
was
just
like
a
naughty
child
all
the
way
and
pulled
all
out
he
has
been
a
good
friend
and
has
a
good
record
he
was
a
bit
done
the
blizzard
had
knocked
him
gallant
little
michael
as
we
got
into
our
bags
the
mountain
tops
were
fuzzy
with
drift
we
wanted
one
clear
day
to
get
across
the
chasm
one
short
march
and
the
ponies
task
was
done
their
food
was
nearly
finished
scott
wrote
that
night
we
are
practically
through
with
the
first
stage
of
our
journey
tuesday
december
camp
noon
we
awoke
this
morning
to
a
raging
howling
blizzard
the
blows
we
have
had
hitherto
have
lacked
the
very
fine
powdering
snow
that
especial
feature
of
the
blizzard
we
have
it
fully
developed
after
a
minute
or
two
in
the
open
one
is
covered
from
head
to
foot
the
temperature
is
high
so
that
what
falls
or
drives
against
one
sticks
the
ponies
heads
tails
legs
and
all
parts
not
protected
by
their
rugs
are
covered
with
ice
the
animals
are
standing
deep
in
snow
the
sledges
are
almost
covered
and
huge
drifts
above
the
tents
we
have
had
breakfast
rebuilt
the
walls
and
are
now
again
in
our
bags
one
can
not
see
the
next
tent
let
alone
the
land
what
on
earth
does
such
weather
mean
at
this
time
of
year
it
is
more
than
our
share
of
i
think
but
the
luck
may
turn
yet
it
has
blown
hard
all
day
with
quite
the
greatest
snowfall
i
remember
the
drifts
about
the
tents
are
simply
huge
the
temperature
was
this
forenoon
and
rose
to
in
the
afternoon
at
which
time
the

it

the
snow
and
as
a
consequence
there
are
pools

the

water

from

and
makes
everything
pretty
wretched
if
a
cold
snap
follows
before
we
have
had
time
to
dry
our
things
we
shall
be
mighty
uncomfortable
yet
after
all
it
would
be
humorous
enough
if
it
were
not
for
the
seriousness
of
delay
we
ca
afford
that
and
it
real
hard
luck
that
it
should
come
at
such
a
time
the
wind
shows
signs
of
easing
down

the

wednesday
december
camp
noon
miserable
utterly
miserable
we
have
camped
in
the
of
despond
the
tempest
rages
with
unabated
violence
the
temperature
has
gone
to
everything
in
the
tent
is
soaking
people
returning
from
the
outside
look
exactly
as
though
they
had
been
in
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
they
drip
pools
on
the
the
snow
is
steadily
climbing
higher
about
walls
ponies
tents
and
sledges
the
ponies
look
utterly
desolate
oh
but
this
is
too
crushing
and
we
are
only
miles
from
the
glacier
a
hopeless
feeling
descends
on
one
and
is
hard
to
fight
off
what
immense
patience
is
needed
for
such
occasions
bowers
describes
the
situation
as
follows
it
is
blowing
a
blizzard
such
as
one
might
expect
to
be
driven
at
us
by
all
the
powers
of
darkness
it
may
be
interesting
to
describe
it
as
it
is
my
first
experience
of
a
really
warm
blizzard
and
i
hope
to
be
troubled
by
cold
ones
only
or
at
least
moderate
ones
only
in
future
as
regards
temperature
when
i
swung
the
thermometer
this
morning
i
looked
and
looked
again
but
unmistakably
the
temperature
was
above
freezing
point
out
of
the
sun
direct
rays
for
the
first
time
since
we
came
down
here
what
this
means
to
us
nobody
can
conceive
we
try
to
treat
it
as
a
huge
joke
but
our
wretched
condition
might
be
amusing
to
read
of
it
later
we
are
wet
through
our
tents
are
wet
our
bags
which
are
our
life
to
us
and
the
objects
of
our
greatest
care
are
wet
the
poor
ponies
are
soaked
and
shivering
far
more
than
they
would
be
ordinarily
in
a
temperature
fifty
degrees
lower
our
sledges
the
parts
that
are
dug
out
are
wet
our
food
is
wet
everything
on
and
around
and
about
us
is
the
same
wet
as
ourselves
and
our
cold
clammy
clothes
water
trickles
down
the
tent
poles
and
only
forms
icicles
in
contact
with
the
snow
floor
the
warmth
of
our
bodies
has
formed
a
snow
bath
in
the
floor
for
each
of
us
to
lie
in
this
is
a
nice
little
catchwater
for
stray
streams
to
run
into
before
they
freeze
this
they
can
not
do
while
a
warm
human
lies
there
so
they
remain
liquid
and
the
accommodating
bag
mops
them
up
when
we
go
out
to
do
the
duties
of
life
fill
the
cooker
for
the
next
meal
dig
out
or
feed
the
ponies
or
anything
else
we
are
bunged
up
with
snow
not
the
driving
sandlike
snow
we
are
used
to
but
great
slushy
flakes
that
run
down
in
water
immediately
and
stream
off
you
the
drifts
are
tremendous
the
rest
of
the
show
is
indescribable
i
feel
most
for
the
unfortunate
animals
and
am
thankful
that
poor
old
victor
is
spared
this
i
mended
a
pair
of
half
mitts
and
we
are
having
two
meals
instead
of
three
this
idleness
when
one
is
simply
jumping
to
go
on
is
bad
enough
for
most
but
must
be
worse
for
captain
scott
i
feel
glad
that
he
has
bill
wilson
in
his
tent
there
is
something
always
so
reassuring
about
bill
he
comes
out
best
in
adversity
thursday
december
camp
the
storm
continues
and
the
situation
is
now
serious
one
small
feed
remains
for
the
ponies
after
so
that
we
must
either
march
or
sacrifice
the
animals
that
is
not
the
worst
with
the
help
of
the
dogs
we
could
get
on
without
doubt
the
serious
part
is
that
we
have
this
morning
started
our
summit
rations
that
is
to
say
the
food
calculated
from
the
glacier
depôt
has
been
begun
the
first
supporting
party
can
only
go
on
a
fortnight
from
this
date
and
so
forth

a
pony
camp
on
the

illustration
the
dog
teams
leaving
the
beardmore
glacier
this
day
was
just
as
warm
and
wetter
much
wetter
the
temperature
was
and
our
bags
were
like
sponges
the
huge
drifts
had
covered
everything
including
most
of
the
tent
the
pony
walls
and
sledges
at
intervals
we
dug
our
way
out
and
dug
up
the
wretched
ponies
and
got
them
on
to
the
top
again
henceforward
our
full
ration
will
be
oz
biscuit
oz
pemmican
oz
butter
oz
cocoa
oz
sugar
and
oz
tea
this
is
the
summit
ration
total
with
a
little
onion
powder
and
salt
i
am
all
for
this
seaman
evans
and
others
are
much
regretting
the
loss
of
chocolate
raisins
and
cereals
for
the
first
week
up
the
glacier
we
are
to
go
one
biscuit
short
to
provision
meares
on
the
way
back
the
motors
depôted
too
much
and
meares
has
been
brought
on
far
farther
than
his
orders
were
originally
bringing
him
originally
he
was
to
be
back
at
hut
point
on
december
the
dogs
however
are
getting
all
the
horse
that
is
good
for
them
and
are
very
fit
he
has
to
average
miles
a
day
going
back
michael
is
well
out
of
this
we
are
now
eating
him
he
was
in
excellent
condition
and
tastes
very
good
though
tough
by
this
time
there
was
little
sleep
left
for
us
as
we
lay
in
our
three
days
generally
see
these
blizzards
out
and
we
hoped
much
from
friday
december
but
when
we
breakfasted
at
we
were
getting
into
routine
wind
and
snow
were
monotonously
the
same
the
temperature
rose
to
these
temperatures
and
those
recorded
by
meares
on
his
way
home
must
be
a
record
for
the
interior
of
the
barrier
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
it
did
not
much
matter
now
whether
it
was
or
things
did
look
really
gloomy
that
morning
but
at
noon
there
came
a
gleam
of
comfort
the
wind
dropped
and
immediately
we
were
out
plunging
about
always
up
to
our
knees
in
soft
downy
snow
and
often
much
farther
first
we
shifted
our
tents
digging
them
up
with
the
greatest
care
that
the
shovel
might
not
tear
them
the
valances
were
encased
in
solid
ice
from
the
water
which
had
run
down
then
we
started
to
find
our
sledges
which
were
about
four
feet
down
they
were
dragged
out
and
everything
on
them
was
wringing
wet
there
was
a
gleam
of
sunshine
which
soon
gave
place
to
snow
and
gloom
but
we
started
to
make
experiments
in
haulage
four
men
on
ski
managed
to
move
a
sledge
with
four
others
sitting
upon
it
nobby
was
led
out
but
sank
to
his
belly
as
for
the
drifts
i
saw
oates
standing
behind
one
and
only
his
head
appeared
and
this
was
all
loose
snow
we
are
all
sitting
round
now
after
some
tea
it
is
much
better
than
getting
into
the
bags
i
can
hardly
think
that
the
ponies
can
pull
on
but
titus
thinks
they
can
pull
all
the
food
is
finished
and
what
they
have
had
was
only
what
they
would
not
eat
out
of
their
last
feed
yesterday
it
is
a
terrible
end
driven
to
death
on
no
more
food
to
be
then
cut
up
poor
devils
i
have
swopped
the
little
minister
with
silas
wright
for
dante
inferno
the
steady
patter
of
the
falling
snow
upon
the
tents
was
depressing
as
we
turned
in
but
the
temperature
was
below
freezing
the
next
morning
saturday
december
we
turned
out
to
a
cloudy
snowy
day
at
by
we
had
hauled
the
sledges
some
way
out
of
the
camp
and
started
to
lead
out
the
ponies
the
horses
could
hardly
move
sank
up
to
their
bellies
and
finally
lay
down
they
had
to
be
driven
lashed
on
it
was
a
grim
business
my
impressions
of
that
day
are
of
groping
our
way
for
bowers
and
i
were
pulling
a
light
sledge
ahead
to
make
the
track
through
a
vague
white
wall
first
a
confused
crowd
of
men
behind
us
gathered
round
the
leading
pony
sledge
pushing
it
forward
the
poor
beast
barely
able
to
struggle
out
of
the
holes
it
made
as
it
plunged
forward
the
others
were
induced
to
follow
and
after
a
start
had
been
made
the
regular
party
went
back
to
fetch
their
load
there
was
not
one
man
there
who
would
willingly
have
caused
pain
to
a
living
thing
but
what
else
was
to
be
done
we
could
not
leave
our
pony
depôt
in
that
bog
hour
after
hour
we
plugged
on
and
we
dare
not
halt
for
lunch
we
knew
we
could
never
start
again
after
crossing
many
waves
huge
pressure
ridges
suddenly
showed
themselves
all
round
and
we
got
on
to
a
steep
rise
with
the
coastal
chasm
on
our
right
hand
appearing
as
a
great
dip
full
of
enormous
pressure
scott
was
naturally
worried
about
crevasses
and
though
we
knew
there
was
a
way
through
the
finding
of
it
in
the
gloom
was
most
difficult
for
two
hours
we
about
getting
forward
it
is
true
but
much
bewildered
and
once
at
any
rate
almost
bogged
scott
joined
us
and
we
took
off
our
ski
so
as
to
find
the
crevasses
and
if
possible
a
hard
way
through
every
step
we
sank
about
fifteen
inches
and
often
above
our
knees
meanwhile
snatcher
was
saving
the
situation
in
and
led
the
line
of
ponies
snippets
nearly
fell
back
into
a
big
crevasse
into
which
his
hind
quarters
fell
but
they
managed
to
unharness
him
and
scramble
him
out
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
had
been
going
when
scott
decided
to
follow
the
chasm
we
found
a
big
dip
with
hard
ice
underneath
and
it
was
probably
here
that
we
made
the
crossing
we
could
now
see
the
ring
of
pressure
behind
us
almost
it
was
decided
to
make
the
depôt
here
but
the
ponies
still
plugged
on
in
the
most
plucky
way
though
they
had
to
be
driven
scott
settled
to
go
as
far
as
they
could
be
induced
to
march
and
they
did
wonderfully
we
had
never
thought
that
they
would
go
a
mile
but
painfully
they
marched
for
eleven
hours
without
a
long
halt
and
covered
a
distance
which
we
then
estimated
at
seven
miles
but
our
were
useless
being
clogged
with
the
soft
snow
and
we
afterwards
came
to
believe
the
distance
was
not
so
great
probably
not
more
than
five
when
we
had
reached
a
point
some
two
miles
from
the
top
of
the
snow
divide
which
fills
the
gateway
we
camped
thankful
to
rest
but
more
thankful
still
that
we
need
drive
those
weary
ponies
no
more
their
rest
was
near
it
was
a
horrid
business
and
the
place
was
known
as
shambles
camp
oates
came
up
to
scott
as
he
stood
in
the
shadow
of
mount
hope
well
i
congratulate
you
titus
said
wilson
and
thank
you
titus
said
scott
and
that
was
the
end
of
the

the

journey
the
southern
journey
involves
the
most
important
object
of
the
expedition
one
can
not
affect
to
be
blind
to
the
situation
the
scientific
public
as
well
as
the
more
general
public
will
gauge
the
result
of
the
scientific
work
of
the
expedition
largely
in

with
the
success
or
failure
of
the
main
object
with
success
all
roads
will
be
made
easy
all
work
will
receive
its

consideration
with
failure
even
the
most
brilliant
work
may
be
neglected

for

ii
the
beardmore
glacier
the
ponies
had
dragged
weekly
units
of
food
for
four
men
to
some
five
miles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glacier
but
we
were
late
for
some
days
we
had
been
eating
the
summit
ration
that
is
the
food
which
should
not
have
been
touched
until
the
glacier
depôt
had
been
laid
and
we
were
still
a
day
run
from
the
place
where
this
was
to
be
done
it
was
of
course
the
result
of
the
blizzard
which
no
one
could
have
expected
in
december
usually
one
of
the
two
most
settled
months
still
more
serious
was
the
deep
snow
which
lay
like
down
upon
the
surface
and
into
which
we
sank
commonly
to
our
knees
our
sledges
digging
themselves
in
until
the
crosspieces
were
ploughing
through
the
drift
shackleton
had
fine
weather
and
found
blue
ice
in
the
bottom
reaches
of
the
glacier
and
scott
lamented
what
was
unquestionably
bad
luck
it
was
noon
of
december
before
we
had
made
the
readjustments
necessary
for
we
left
here
pony
meat
for
man
and
dog
food
three
sledges
one
sledge
and
a
good
many
oddments
of
clothing
and
pony
gear
we
started
with
three
teams
each
pulling
for
these
first
few
miles

the

had

together
some

and
two
members
of
it
lieut
evans
and
lashly
had
already
been
since
the
breakdown
of
the
second
motor
at
corner
camp
it
was
certainly
not
so
fit
as
the
other
two
in
addition
to
these
three
sledges
the
two
which
had
been
doing
splendid
work
were
carrying
lbs
of
our
weight
as
well
as
the
provisions
for
the
lower
glacier
depôt
weighing
lbs
it
began
to
look
as
if
amundsen
had
chosen
the
right
form
of
transport
the
gateway
is
a
gap
in
the
mountains
a
side
door
as
it
were
to
the
great
tumbled
glacier
by
lunch
we
were
on
the
top
of
the
divide
but
it
took
six
hours
of
the
hardest
hauling
to
cover
the
mile
which
formed
the
rise
as
long
as
possible
we
stuck
to
ski
but
we
reached
a
point
at
which
we
could
not
move
the
sledges
on
ski
once
we
had
taken
them
off
we
were
up
to
our
knees
and
the
sledges
were
ploughing
the
snow
which
would
not
support
them
but
our
gear
was
drying
in
the
bright
sunshine
our
bags
were
spread
out
at
every
opportunity
and
the
great
jagged
cliffs
of
red
granite
were
welcome
to
the
eyes
after
statute
miles
of
snow
the
gateway
is
filled
by
a
giant
snowdrift
which
has
been
formed
between
mount
hope
on
our
left
and
the
mainland
on
our
right
from
book
we
gathered
that
the
beardmore
was
a
very
bad
glacier
indeed
once
on
the
top
of
the
divide
we
lunched
and
we
descended
in
the
evening
camping
at
midnight
on
the
edge
of
the
glacier
which
we
found
as
we
had
feared
covered
with
soft
snow
which
was
so
deep
as
to
give
no
indication
whatever
of
the
hard
ice
which
shackleton
found
here
we
camped
in
considerable
drift
and
a
blizzard
wind
which
is
still
blowing
and
i
hope
will
go
on
for
every
hour
it
is
sweeping
away
inches
of
this
soft
powdery
snow
into
which
we
have
been
sinking
all
day
before
setting
out
on
december
we
rigged
up
the
lower
glacier
depôt
three
weekly
summit
units
of
provisions
two
cases
of
emergency
biscuit
which
was
the
ration
for
three
weekly
units
and
two
cans
of
oil
these
provisions
were
calculated
to
carry
the
three
returning
parties
as
far
as
the
southern
barrier
depôt
we
also
left
one
can
of
spirit
used
for
lighting
the
primus
one
bottle
of
medical
brandy
and
certain
spare
and
personal
gear
not
required
on
the
sledges
themselves
we
stowed
eighteen
weekly
summit
units
besides
the
three
ready
bags
containing
the
ration
for
the
current
week
and
the
complement
of
biscuit
for
this
was
ten
cases
in
addition
to
the
three
boxes
of
biscuit
which
the
three
parties
were
using
then
there
were
eighteen
cans
of
oil
with
two
cans
of
lighting
spirit
and
a
little
additional
christmas
fare
which
bowers
had
packed
every
unit
of
food
was
worked
out
for
four
men

during
this
time
of
deep
snow
the
would
not
work
and
we
were
compelled
to
estimate
the
distance
marched
each
day
it
has
been
a
tremendous
slog
but
i
think
a
most
hopeful
day
before
starting
it
took
us
about
two
hours
to
make
the
depôt
and
then
we
got
straight
into
the
midst
of
the
big
pressure
the
dogs
with
ten
cases
of
biscuit
came
behind
and
pulled
very
well
we
soon
caught
sight
of
a
big
boulder
and
bill
and
i
roped
up
and
went
over
to
it
it
was
a
block
of
very
coarse
granite
nearly
gneiss
with
large
crystals
of
quartz
in
it
rusty
outside
and
quite
pinkish
when
chipped
and
with
veins
of
quartz
running
through
it
it
was
a
vast
thing
to
be
carried
along
on
the
ice
and
looked
very
typical
of
the
rock
round
instead
of
keeping
under
the
great
cliff
where
shackleton
made
his
depôt
we
steered
for
mount
kyffin
that
is
towards
the
middle
of
the
glacier
until
lunch
when
we
had
probably
done
about
two
or
three
miles
there
was
a
crevasse
wherever
we
went
but
we
managed
to
pull
on
ski
and
had
no
one
down
and
the
deep
snow
saved
the
dogs
the
were
certainly
running
very
big
risks
that
morning
they
turned
back
after
lunch
having
been
brought
on
far
longer
than
had
been
originally
intended
for
as
i
have
said
they
were
to
have
been
back
at
hut
point
before
now
and
their
provision
allowance
would
not
allow
of
further
advance
perhaps
we
rather
overestimated
the
dogs
capacities
when
bowers
wrote
the
dogs
are
wonderfully
fit
and
will
rush
meares
and
dimitri
back
like
the
wind
i
expect
he
will
be
nearly
back
by
christmas
as
they
will
do
about
thirty
miles
a
day
but
meares
told
us
when
we
got
back
to
the
hut
that
the
dogs
had
by
no
means
had
an
easy
journey
home
now
however
with
a
whirl
and
a
rush
they
were
off
on
the
homeward
trail
i
could
not
see
them
being
but
heard
the
familiar
orders
as
the
last
of
our
animal
transport
left
us
our
difficulties
during
the
next
four
days
were
increased
by
the
of
half
the
men
the
evening
we
reached
the
glacier
bowers
wrote
i
am
afraid
i
am
going
to
pay
dearly
for
not
wearing
goggles
yesterday
when
piloting
the
ponies
my
right
eye
has
gone
bung
and
my
left
one
is
pretty
dicky
if
i
am
in
for
a
dose
of
snow
glare
it
will
take
three
or
four
days
to
leave
me
and
i
am
afraid
i
am
in
the
ditch
this
time
it
is
painful
to
look
at
this
paper
and
my
eyes
are
fairly
burning
as
if
some
one
had
thrown
sand
into
them
and
then
i
have
missed
my
journal
for
four
days
having
been
enduring
the
pains
of
hell
with
my
eyes
as
well
as
doing
the
most
work
i
have
ever
come
up
against
i
was
as
blind
as
a
bat
and
so
was
keohane
in
my
team
cherry
pulled
alongside
me
with
crean
and
keohane
behind
by
sticking
plaster
over
my
glasses
except
one
small
central
spot
i
shut
off
most
light
and
could
see
the
points
of
my
ski
but
the
glasses
were
always
fogged
with
perspiration
and
my
eyes
kept
on
streaming
water
which
can
not
be
wiped
off
on
the
march
as
a
ski
stick
is
held
in
each
hand
and
so
heavy
were
our
weights
we
had
now
taken
on
the
weights
which
had
been
on
the
dog
sledges
that
if
any
of
the
pair
slacked
a
hand
even
the
sledge
stopped
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
keep
the
sledge
moving
for
short
spells
of
a
few
hundred
yards
the
whole
concern
sinking
so
deeply
into
the
soft
snow
as
to
form
a
the
starting
was
worse
than
pulling
as
it
required
from
ten
to
fifteen
desperate
jerks
on
the
harness
to
move
the
sledge
at
all
many
others
were
also
snowblind
caused
partly
by
the
strain
of
the
last
march
of
the
ponies
partly
by
not
having
realized
that
now
that
we
were
the
sun
was
more
powerful
and
more
precautions
should
be
taken
the
cocaine
and
zinc
sulphate
tablets
which
we
had
were
excellent
but
we
also
found
that
our
tea
leaves
which
had
been
boiled
twice
and
would
otherwise
have
been
thrown
away
relieved
the
pain
if
tied
into
some
cotton
and
kept
pressed
against
the
eyes
the
tannic
acid
in
the
tea
acted
as
an
astringent
a
snowblind
man
can
see
practically
nothing
anyhow
and
so
he
is
not
much
worse
off
if
a
handkerchief
is
tied
over
his
eyes
just
a
tiny
note
to
be
taken
back
by
the
dogs
things
are
not
so
rosy
as
they
might
be
but
we
keep
our
spirits
up
and
say
the
luck
must
turn
this
is
only
to
tell
you
that
i
find
i
can
keep
up
with
the
rest
as
well
as
of
old
illustration
mount
smith
and
the
land
to
the
wilson
del
emery
walker
limited
collotypers
then
for
the
first
time
we
were
left
with
our
full
loads
of
lbs
a
sledge
even
bowers
asked
scott
whether
he
was
going
to
try
it
without
relaying
that
night
scott
diary
runs
it
was
a
very
anxious
business
when
we
started
after
lunch
about
could
we
pull
our
full
loads
or
not
my
own
party
got
away
first
and
to
my
joy
i
found
we
could
make
fairly
good
headway
every
now
and
again
the
sledge
sank
in
a
soft
patch
which
brought
us
up
but
we
learned
to
treat
such
occasions
with
patience
we
got
sideways
to
the
sledge
and
hauled
it
out
evans
getting
out
of
his
ski
to
get
better
purchase
the
great
thing
is
to
keep
the
sledge
moving
and
for
an
hour
or
more
there
were
dozens
of
critical
moments
when
it
all
but
stopped
and
not
a
few
when
it
brought
up
altogether
the
latter
were
very
trying
and
tiring
altogether
it
was
an
encouraging
day
and
we
reckoned
we
had
made
seven
miles
generally
it
was
not
scott
team
which
made
the
heaviest
weather
these
days
but
on
december
they
were
in
greater
difficulties
than
any
of
us
it
was
indeed
a
gruelling
day
for
the
surface
was
worse
than
ever
and
many
men
were
after
five
hours
work
in
the
morning
we
were
about
half
a
mile
forward
we
were
in
a
sea
of
pressure
the
waves
coming
at
us
from
our
starboard
bow
the
distance
between
the
crests
not
being
very
great
we
could
not
have
advanced
at
all
had
it
not
been
for
our
ski
on
foot
one
sinks
to
the
knees
and
if
pulling
on
a
sledge
to
half
way
between
knee
and
thigh
on
december
the
sledges
sank
in
over
twelve
inches
and
all
the
gear
as
well
as
the
thwartship
pieces
were
acting
as
breaks
the
tugs
and
heaves
we
enjoyed
and
the
number
of
times
we
had
to
get
out
of
our
ski
to
upright
the
sledge
were
trifles
compared
with
the
strenuous
exertion
of
every
muscle
and
nerve
to
keep
the
wretched
drag
from
stopping
when
once
under
weigh
and
then
it
would
stick
and
all
the
starting
operations
had
to
be
gone
through
afresh
we
did
perhaps
half
a
mile
in
the
forenoon
anticipating
a
better
surface
in
the
afternoon
we
got
a
shock
teddy
evans
led
off
half
an
hour
earlier
to
pilot
a
way
and
captain
scott
tried
some
fake
with
his
spare
runners
he
lashed
them
under
the
sledge
to
prevent
the
ploughing
the
snow
that
involved
about
an
hour
work
we
had
to
continually
turn
our
runners
up
to
scrape
the
ice
off
them
for
in
these
temperatures
they
are
liable
to
get
warm
and
melt
the
snow
on
them
and
that
freezes
into
knobs
of
ice
which
act
like
sandpaper
or
spikes
on
a
pair
of
skates
we
bust
off
second
full
of
hope
having
done
so
well
in
the
forenoon
but
pride
goeth
before
a
fall
we
stuck
ten
yards
from
the
camp
and
nine
hours
later
found
us
little
more
than
half
a
mile
on
i
have
never
seen
a
sledge
sink
so
i
have
never
pulled
so
hard
or
so
nearly
crushed
my
inside
into
my
backbone
by
the
everlasting
jerking
with
all
my
strength
on
the
canvas
band
round
my
unfortunate
tummy
we
were
all
in
the
same
boat
however
i
saw
teddy
struggling
ahead
and
scott
astern
but
we
were
the
worst
off
as
the
leading
team
had
topped
the
rise
and
i
was
too
blind
to
pick
out
a
better
trail
we
fairly
played
ourselves
out
that
time
and
finally
had
to
give
it
up
and
relay
halving
the
load
we
went
forward
about
a
mile
with
it
and
leaving
that
lot
went
back
for
the
remainder
so
done
were
my
team
that
we
could
do
little
more
than
pull
the
half
loads
team
did
the
same
and
though
scott
did
not
we
camped
practically
the
same
time
having
gone
over
our
distance
three
times
mount
kyffin
was
still
ahead
of
us
to
the
left
we
seemed
as
if
we
can
never
come
up
with
it
scott
decided
that
if
we
could
not
move
our
full
loads
we
would
start
relaying
systematically
it
was
a
most
depressing
outlook
after
such
a
day
of
strenuous
labour
we
got
soaked
with
perspiration
these
days
though
generally
pulling
in
vest
pants
and
windproof
trousers
only
directly
we
stopped
we
cooled
quickly
two
skuas
appeared
at
lunch
attracted
probably
by
the
pony
flesh
below
but
it
was
a
long
way
from
the
sea
for
them
to
come
on
thursday
december
scott
wrote
indigestion
and
the
soggy
condition
of
my
clothes
kept
me
awake
for
some
time
last
night
and
the
exceptional
exercise
gives
bad
attacks
of
cramp
our
lips
are
getting
raw
and
blistered
the
eyes
of
the
party
are
improving
i
am
glad
to
say
we
are
just
starting
our
march

no
very
hopeful
outlook

but
we
slogged
along
with
much
better

once
into
the
middle
of
the
glacier
we
had
been
steering
more
or
less
for
the
cloudmaker
and
by
supper
were
well
past
mount
kyffin
and
were
about
feet
up
after
an
estimated
run
of
or
statute
miles
but
the
most
cheering
sign
was
that
the
blue
ice
was
gradually
coming
nearer
the
surface
at
lunch
it
was
two
feet
down
and
at
our
supper
camp
only
one
foot
in
pitching
our
tent
crean
broke
into
a
crevasse
which
ran
about
a
foot
in
front
of
the
door
and
there
was
another
at
scott
door
we
threw
an
empty
oil
can
down
and
it
echoed
for
a
terribly
long
time
we
spent
the
morning
of
december
crossing
a
maze
of
crevasses
though
they
were
well
bridged
i
believe
all
these
lower
reaches
of
the
glacier
are
badly
crevassed
but
the
thick
snow
and
our
ski
kept
us
from
tumbling
in
there
was
a
great
deal
of
competition
between
the
teams
which
was
perhaps
unavoidable
but
probably
a
pity
this
day
bowers
diary
records
did
a
splendid
bust
off
on
ski
leaving
scott
in
the
lurch
and
eventually
overhauling
the
party
which
had
left
some
time
before
us
all
the
morning
we
kept
up
a
steady
even
swing
which
was
quite
a
pleasure
but
the
same
day
scott
wrote
evans
is
now
decidedly
the
slowest
unit
though
bowers
is
not
much
faster
we
keep
up
and
overhaul
either
without
difficulty
bowers
team
considered
themselves
quite
good
but
both
teams
were
satisfied
of
their
own
superiority
as
a
matter
of
fact
scott
was
the
faster
as
it
should
have
been
for
it
was
certainly
the
heavier
of
the
two
it
was
a
very
bad
light
all
day
but
after
lunch
it
began
to
get
worse
and
by
it
was
snowing
hard
and
we
could
see
nothing
we
went
on
for
nearly
an
hour
steering
by
the
wind
and
any
glimpse
of
sastrugi
and
then
very
reluctantly
scott
camped
it
looks
better
now
the
surface
is
much
harder
and
more
and
as
a
rule
the
ice
is
only
six
inches
underneath
we
are
beginning
to
talk
about
christmas
we
get
very
thirsty
these
days
in
the
warm
temperatures
we
shall
feel
it
farther
up
when
the
cold
gets
into
our
open
pores
and
sunburnt
hands
and
cracked
lips
i
am
plastering
some
skin
on
mine
our
routine
now
is
turn
out
lunch
and
camp
at
and
we
get
a
short
hours
sleep
but
we
are
so
dead
tired
we
could
sleep
half
into
the
next
day

get
about

lunch

positive

are
raising

bowers
wrote
we
have
had
a
really
enjoyable
day
march
except
the
latter
end
of
the
afternoon
at
the
outset
in
the
forenoon
my
sledge
was
a
bit
in
the
lurch
and
scott
drew
steadily
away
from
us
i
knew
i
could
ordinarily
hold
my
own
with
him
but
for
the
first
two
hours
we
dropped
till
we
were
several
hundred
yards
astern
try
as
i
would
to
rally
up
my
team
we
could
gain
nothing
on
examining
the
runners
however
we
soon
discovered
the
cause
by
the
presence
of
a
thin
film
of
ice
after
that
we
ran
easily
the
thing
one
must
avoid
doing
is
to
touch
them
with
the
hand
or
mitt
as
anything
damp
will
make
ice
on
them
we
usually
turn
the
sledge
on
its
side
and
scrape
one
runner
at
a
time
with
the
back
of
our
knives
so
as
to
avoid
any
chance
of
cutting
or
chipping
them
in
the
afternoon
either
the
tea
or
the
butter
we
had
at
lunch
made
us
so
strong
that
we
fairly
overran
the
other
team
we
must
push
on
all
we
can
for
we
are
now
days
behind
shackleton
all
due
to
that
wretched
storm
so
far
since
we
got
among
the
disturbances
we
have
not
seen
such
alarming
crevasses
as
i
had
expected
certainly
dogs
could
have
come
up
as
far
as
this
illustration
mount
patrick
wilson
del
at
lunch
we
could
see
big
pressure
ahead
having
done
first
over
five
miles
soon
after
lunch
having
gone
down
a
bit
we
rose
among
very
rough
stuff
we
plugged
on
until
when
ski
became
quite
impossible
and
we
put
them
on
the
sledges
and
started
on
foot
we
immediately
began
putting
legs
down
one
step
would
be
on
blue
ice
and
the
next
two
feet
down
into
snow
very
hard
going
the
pressure
ahead
seemed
to
stretch
right
into
a
big
glacier
next
the
keltie
glacier
to
the
east
and
so
we
altered
course
for
a
small
bluff
point
about
of
the
way
along
the
base
of
the
cloudmaker
we
were
to
camp
at
but
did
not
do
so
until
about
the
last
hours
in
big
pressure
crossing
big
and
smaller
waves
and
hundreds
of
crevasses
which
one
of
us
generally
found
we
are
now
camped
in
very
big
pressure
and
with
difficulty
we
found
a
patch
big
enough
to
pitch
the
tent
free
from
crevasses
we
are
pretty
well
past
the
keltie
glacier
which
is
a
vast
tumbled
mass
there
is
a
long
line
of
ice
falls
ahead
and
i
think
there
is
a
hard
day
ahead
of
us
among
that
pressure
which
must
be
enormous
we
ca
go
farther
inshore
here
being
under
the
north
end
of
the
cloudmaker
and
a
fine
mountain
it
is
rising
precipitously
above
us
sunday
december
nearly
miles
temp
feet
we
have
had
an
exciting
day
this
morning
was
just
like
the
scenic
railway
at
earl
court
we
got
straight
on
to
the
big
pressure
waves
and
headed
for
the
humpy
rock
at
the
base
of
the
cloudmaker
it
was
a
hard
plug
up
the
waves
very
often
standing
pulls
and
all
that
we
could
do
for
a
course
was
a
very
varied
direction
going
down
the
other
side
was
the
exciting
part
all
we
could
do
was
to
set
the
sledge
straight
hang
on
to
the
straps
give
her
a
little
push
and
rush
down
the
slope
which
was
sometimes
so
sheer
that
the
sledge
was
in
the
air
sometimes
there
was
no
chance
to
brake
the
sledge
and
we
all
had
to
get
on
to
the
top
and
we
rushed
down
with
the
wind
whistling
in
our
ears
after
three
hours
of
this
it
levelled
out
again
a
bit
and
we
took
the
top
of
a
wave
and
ran
south
along
it
on
blue
ice
enormous
pressure
to
our
right
largely
i
think
caused
by
the
keltie
glacier
then
we
ascended
a
rise
snowy
and
crevassed
and
camped
after
doing
just
under
five
miles
with
big
pressure
ahead
in
the
afternoon
we
had
a
hard
surface
scott
started
off
at
a
great
speed
teddy
evans
and
i
following
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
team
or
my
sledge
as
we
had
a
desperate
job
to
keep
up
at
first
we
did
keep
up
all
right
but
were
heartily
glad
when
after
about
hours
scott
stopped
for
a
spell
i
rearranged
our
harness
putting
cherry
and
myself
on
the
long
span
again
which
we
had
temporarily
discarded
in
the
morning
we
were
both
winded
and
felt
wronged
the
rearrangement
was
a
success
however
and
the
remainder
of
the
march
was
a
pleasure
instead
of
a
desperate
struggle
it
finished
up
on
fields
of
blue
rippled
ice
with
sharp
knife
edges
and
snow
patches
few
and
far
between
we
are
all
camped
on
a
small
snow
patch
in
the
middle
of
a
pale
blue
rippled
sea
about
feet
above
sea
level
and
past
the
cloudmaker
which
means
that
we
are
half
way
up
the
glacier
we
had
done
miles
statute
the
beardmore
glacier
is
twice
as
large
as
the
malaspina
in
alaska
which
was
the
largest
known
glacier
until
shackleton
discovered
the
beardmore
those
who
knew
the
ferrar
glacier
professed
to
find
the
beardmore
unattractive
but
to
me
at
any
rate
it
was
grand
its
very
vastness
however
tends
to
dwarf
its
surroundings
and
great
tributary
glaciers
and
tumbled
which
anywhere
else
would
have
aroused
admiration
were
almost
unnoticed
in
a
stream
which
stretched
in
places
forty
miles
from
bank
to
bank
it
was
only
when
the
theodolite
was
levelled
that
we
realized
how
vast
were
the
mountains
which
surrounded
us
one
of
which
we
reckoned
to
be
well
over
twenty
thousand
feet
in
height
and
many
of
the
others
must
have
approached
that
measurement
lieutenant
evans
and
bowers
were
surveying
whenever
the
opportunity
offered
whilst
wilson
sat
on
the
sledge
or
on
his
and
sketched
before
leaving
on
the
morning
of
december
we
bagged
off
three
units
and
made
a
depôt
marked
by
a
red
flag
on
a
bamboo
which
was
stuck
into
a
small
mound
unfortunately
it
began
to
snow
in
the
night
and
no
bearings
were
taken
until
the
following
morning
when
only
the
base
of
the
mountains
on
the
west
side
was
visible
we
knew
we
might
have
difficulty
in
picking
up
this
depôt
again
and
certainly
we
all
did
it
was
thick
with
low
stratus
clouds
in
the
morning
and
snow
was
falling
in
large
crystals
our
socks
and
finnesko
hung
out
to
dry
were
covered
with
most
beautiful
feathery
crystals
in
the
warm
weather
one
gets
fairly
saturated
with
perspiration
on
the
march
and
is
always
wet
except
the
outside
covering
which
is
as
a
rule
more
or
less
frozen
according
to
existing
temperature
on
camping
at
night
i
shift
to
night
as
soon
as
ever
the
tent
is
pitched
and
generally
slip
on
my
windproof
blouse
as
one
cools
down
like
smoke
after
the
exertion
of
a
heavy
sledge
for
hours
at
lunch
camp
one
feet
often
get
pretty
cold
but
this
goes
off
as
soon
as
some
hot
tea
is
got
into
the
system
as
a
rule
even
when
snowing
one
socks
will
dry
if
there
is
a
bit
of
a
breeze
they
are
always
frozen
stiff
in
the
morning
and
can
best
be
thawed
out
by
bundling
the
lot
under
one
jersey
during
breakfast
they
can
then
be
put
on
tolerably
warm
even
if
wet
we
started
off
on
a
hard
rippled
blue
surface
like
a
sea
frozen
intact
while
the
wind
was
playing
on
it
it
soon
got
worse
and
we
had
to
have
one
and
sometimes
two
hands
back
to
keep
the
sledge
from
skidding
of
course
it
was
easy
enough
stuff
to
pull
on
but
the
ground
was
very
uneven
and
sledges
constantly
capsized
it
did
not
improve
the
runners
either
there
were
few
crevasses
all
day
we
went
on
in
dull
cloudy
weather
with
hardly
any
land
visible
and
the
glacier
to
be
seen
only
for
a
short
distance
in
the
afternoon
the
clouds
lifted
somewhat
and
showed
us
the
adam
mountains
the
surface
was
better
for
the
sledges
but
worse
for
us
as
there
were
countless
cracks
and
small
crevasses
into
which
we
constantly
trod
barking
our
shins
as
the
afternoon
sun
came
round
the
perspiration
fairly
streamed
down
and
it
was
impossible
to
keep
goggles
clear
the
surface
was
so
slippery
and
uneven
that
it
was
difficult
to
keep
one
foothold
however
we
did
miles
and
felt
that
we
had
really
done
a
good
day
work
when
we
camped
it
was
not
clear
enough
to
survey
in
the
evening
so
i
took
the
in
hand
and
worked
at
it
half
the
night
to
repair
christopher
damage
i
ended
up
by
making
a
fixing
of
which
i
was
very
proud
but
did
not
dare
to
look
at
the
time
so
i
do
know
how
much
sleep
i
missed
there
is
no
doubt
that
scott
knows
where
to
aim
for
in
a
glacier
as
it
was
just
here
that
shackleton
had
two
or
three
of
his
worst
days
work
in
such
a
maze
of
crevasses
that
he
said
that
often
a
slip
meant
death
for
the
whole
party
he
avoids
the
sides
of
the
glacier
and
goes
nowhere
near
the
snow
he
often
heads
straight
for
apparent
chaos
and
somehow
when
we
appear
to
have
reached
a
we
find
it
an
open
road
however
we
all
found
the
trouble
on
our
way
back
on
our
right
we
have
now
a
pretty
good
view
of
the
adam
marshall
and
wild
mountains
and
their
very
curious
horizontal
stratification
wright
has
found
amongst
bits
of
débris
an
undoubted
bit
of
sandstone
and
a
bit
of
black
basalt
we
must
get
to
know
more
of
the
geology
before
leaving
the
glacier
finally
december
total
height
feet
things
are
certainly
looking
up
seeing
that
we
have
risen
feet
and
marched
to
statute
miles
during
the
day
whereas
shackleton
last
march
was
statute
it
was
still
thick
when
we
turned
out
at
but
it
soon
cleared
with
a
fresh
southerly
wind
and
we
could
see
buckley
island
and
the
land
at
the
head
of
the
glacier
just
rising
we
started
late
for
birdie
wanted
to
get
our
dished
up
it
has
been
quite
a
job
getting
it
on
but
it
rode
well
this
afternoon
we
started
over
the
same
crevassed
stuff
but
soon
got
on
to
blue
ice
and
for
two
hours
had
a
most
pleasant
pull
and
then
up
a
steepish
rise
sometimes
on
blue
ice
and
sometimes
on
snow
after
the
pleasantest
morning
we
have
had
we
completed
miles
illustration
from
mount
deakin
to
mount
kinsey
wilson
del
emery
walker
limited
collotypers
angles
and
observations
were
taken
at
lunch
and
quite
a
lot
of
work
was
done
there
is
a
general
getting
squared
up
with
gear
for
we
know
that
those
going
on
will
not
have
many
more
days
of
warm
temperatures
at
one
time
i
think
scott
meant
trying
the
right
hand
of
the
island
or
nunatak
but
as
we
rose
this
was
obviously
impossible
for
there
is
a
huge
mass
of
pressure
coming
down
there
from
here
the
dominion
range
also
looks
as
if
it
were
a
nunatak
some
of
these
mountains
which
look
very
big
are
huge
since
the
six
thousand
feet
which
we
have
risen
have
to
be
added
on
to
them
and
many
of
them
are
very
grand
indeed
the
mill
glacier
is
a
vast
thing
with
big
pressure
across
it
there
also
seems
to
be
a
big
series
of
between
buckley
island
and
the
dominion
range
for
the
centre
of
which
scott
is
going
a
pretty
hard
plug
this
afternoon
but
no
disturbance
and
gradually
we
have
left
the
bare
ice
and
are
mostly
travelling
on
much
of
the
ice
is
white
i
have
been
writing
down
angles
and
times
for
birdie
and
writing
this
in
the
intervals
scott
heel
is
troubling
him
again
have
bad
bruises
on
knee
and
thigh
and
generally
there
has
been
a
run
on
the
medical
cases
for
chafes
and
minor
ailments
there
is
now
a
keen
southerly
wind
blowing
it
gets
a
little
colder
each
day
and
we
are
already
beginning
to
feel
it
on
our
sunburnt
faces
and
hands
of
the
crevasses
met
in
the
morning
bowers
wrote
so
far
nobody
has
dropped
down
the
length
of
his
harness
as
i
did
on
the
cape
crozier
journey
on
this
blue
ice
they
are
pretty
conspicuous
and
as
they
are
mostly
one
is
well
advised
to
step
over
any
line
of
snow
with
my
short
legs
this
was
strenuous
work
especially
as
the
weight
of
the
sledge
would
often
stop
me
with
a
jerk
just
before
my
leading
foot
quite
cleared
a
crevasse
and
the
next
minute
one
would
be
struggling
out
so
as
to
keep
the
sledge
on
the
move
it
is
fatal
to
stop
the
sledge
as
nobody
waits
for
stragglers
and
you
have
to
pick
up
your
lost
ground
by
strenuous
hurry
of
course
some
one
often
gets
so
far
down
a
hole
that
it
is
necessary
to
stop
and
help
him
out
december
has
been
a
great
march
over
two
miles
an
hour
and
on
the
whole
rising
a
lot
soon
after
starting
we
got
on
to
the
most
beautiful
icy
surface
smooth
except
for
cracks
and
only
patches
of
snow
most
of
which
we
could
avoid
we
came
along
at
a
great
rate
the
most
interesting
thing
to
see
was
that
the
mill
glacier
is
not
as
was
supposed
a
tributary
but
probably
is
an
outlet
falling
from
this
glacier
and
a
great
size
however
it
was
soon
covered
up
with
dense
black
cloud
and
there
were
billows
of
cloud
behind
us
and
below
at
lunch
birdie
made
the
disastrous
discovery
that
the
registering
dial
of
his
was
off
a
screw
had
shaken
out
on
the
bumpy
ice
and
the
clockwork
had
fallen
off
this
is
serious
for
it
means
that
one
of
the
three
returning
parties
will
have
to
go
without
and
their
navigation
will
be
much
more
difficult
birdie
is
very
upset
especially
after
all
the
trouble
he
has
taken
with
it
and
the
hours
which
he
has
sat
up
after
lunch
he
and
bill
walked
back
near
two
miles
in
the
tracks
but
could
not
see
it
it
was
then
getting
very
thick
coming
over
from
the
north
it
appeared
to
be
blizzing
down
the
glacier
though
clear
to
the
south
the
northerly
wind
drove
up
a
of
snow
and
very
soon
fogged
us
completely
however
we
found
our
way
back
to
camp
by
the
crampon
tracks
on
the
blue
ice
and
then
packed
up
to
leave
we
started
making
a
course
to
hit
the
east
side
of
the
island
where
there
seems
to
be
the
only
break
in
the
which
stretch
right
across
the
weather
lifted
and
we
are
now
camped
with
the
island
just
to
our
right
the
long
strata
of
coal
showing
plainly
in
it
and
just
in
front
of
us
is
this
steep
bit
up
through
the
falls
we
have
done
nearly
statute
miles
pulling
lbs
a
man
this
evening
has
been
rather
a
shock
as
i
was
getting
my
finnesko
on
to
the
top
of
my
ski
beyond
the
tent
scott
came
up
to
me
and
said
that
he
was
afraid
he
had
rather
a
blow
for
me
of
course
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
but
could
hardly
grasp
that
i
was
going
back
night
the
returning
party
is
to
be
atch
silas
keohane
and
self
illustration
night
camp
buckley
island
december
scott
was
very
put
about
said
he
had
been
thinking
a
lot
about
it
but
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
seamen
with
their
special
knowledge
would
be
needed
to
rebuild
the
sledge
i
suppose
wilson
told
me
it
was
a
whether
titus
or
i
should
go
on
that
being
so
i
think
titus
will
help
him
more
than
i
can
i
said
all
i
could
think
of
he
seemed
so
cut
up
about
it
saying
think
somehow
it
is
specially
hard
on
you
i
said
i
hoped
i
had
not
disappointed
him
and
he
caught
hold
of
me
and
said
no
no
so
if
that
is
the
case
all
is
well
he
told
me
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
glacier
he
was
hardly
expecting
to
go
on
himself
i
do
know
what
the
trouble
is
but
his
foot
is
troubling
him
and
also
i
think
indigestion
scott
just
says
in
his
diary
i
dreaded
this
necessity
of
choosing
nothing
could
be
more
heartrending
and
then
he
goes
on
to
sum
up
the
situation
i
calculated
our
programme
to
start
from
with
units
of
food
and
eight
men
we
ought
to
be
in
this
position
night
less
one
day
food
after
all
our
harassing
trouble
one
can
not
but
be
satisfied
with
such
a
prospect
december
upper
glacier
depôt
started
off
with
a
nippy
wind
in
our
faces
but
bright
sunshine
one
nose
and
lips
being
chapped
and
much
skinned
with
alternate
heat
and
cold
a
breeze
in
the
face
is
absolute
agony
until
you
warm
up
this
does
not
take
long
however
when
pulling
a
sledge
so
after
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
more
or
less
one
is
comfortable
unless
the
wind
is
very
strong
we
made
towards
the
only
place
where
it
seemed
possible
to
cross
the
mass
of
pressure
ice
caused
by
the
junction
of
the
plateau
with
the
glacier
and
congested
between
the
nunatak
buckley
island
and
the
dominion
range
scott
had
considered
at
one
time
going
up
to
westward
of
the
nunatak
but
this
appeared
more
chaotic
than
the
other
side
we
made
for
a
slope
close
to
the
end
of
the
island
or
nunatak
where
shackleton
must
have
got
up
also
it
is
obviously
the
only
place
when
you
look
at
it
from
a
commanding
rise
we
did
not
go
quite
so
close
to
the
land
as
shackleton
did
and
therefore
as
had
been
the
case
with
us
all
the
way
up
the
glacier
found
less
difficulties
than
he
met
with
scott
is
quite
wonderful
in
his
selections
of
route
as
we
have
escaped
excessive
dangers
and
difficulties
all
along
in
this
case
we
had
fairly
good
going
but
got
into
a
perfect
mass
of
crevasses
into
which
we
all
continually
fell
mostly
one
foot
but
often
two
and
occasionally
we
went
down
altogether
some
to
the
length
of
their
harness
to
be
hauled
out
with
the
alpine
rope
most
of
them
could
be
seen
by
the
strip
of
snow
on
the
blue
ice
they
were
often
too
wide
to
jump
though
and
the
only
thing
was
to
plant
your
feet
on
the
bridge
and
try
not
to
tread
heavily
as
a
rule
the
centre
of
a
bridged
crevasse
is
the
safest
place
the
rotten
places
are
at
the
edges
we
had
to
go
over
dozens
by
hopping
right
on
to
the
bridge
and
then
over
on
to
the
ice
it
is
a
bit
of
a
jar
when
it
gives
way
under
you
but
the
friendly
harness
is
made
to
trust
life
to
the
lord
only
knows
how
deep
these
vast
chasms
go
down
they
seem
to
extend
into
blue
black
nothingness
thousands
of
feet
below
before
reaching
the
rise
we
had
to
go
up
and
down
many
steep
slopes
and
on
the
one
side
the
sledges
were
overrunning
us
and
on
the
other
it
fairly
took
the
juice
out
of
you
to
reach
the
top
we
saw
the
stratification
on
the
nunatak
which
shackleton
supposed
to
be
coal
there
was
also
much
sandstone
and
red
granite
i
should
like
to
have
scratched
round
these
rocks
we
may
get
a
chance
on
our
return
journey
as
we
topped
each
rise
we
found
another
one
beyond
it
and
so
on
about
noon
some
clouds
settled
in
a
fog
round
us
and
being
fairly
in
a
trough
of
crevasses
we
could
not
get
on
fortunately
we
found
a
snow
patch
to
pitch
the
tents
on
but
even
there
were
crevasses
under
us
however
we
enjoyed
a
hearty
lunch
and
i
improved
the
shining
hour
by
preparing
my
rations
for
the
upper
glacier
depôt
at
it
cleared
and
mount
darwin
a
nunatak
to
the
of
the
others
could
be
seen
this
we
made
for
and
some
two
miles
on
exchanged
blue
ice
for
the
new
snow
which
was
much
harder
pulling
scott
was
fairly
wound
up
and
he
went
on
and
on
every
rise
topped
seemed
to
fire
him
with
a
desire
to
top
the
next
and
every
rise
had
another
beyond
and
above
it
we
camped
at
all
pretty
weary
having
come
up
nearly
feet
and
done
over
eleven
miles
in
a
direction
we
were
south
of
mount
darwin
in
and
our
corrected
altitude
proved
to
be
feet
above
the
barrier
i
worked
up
till
a
very
late
hour
getting
the
depôt
stores
ready
and
also
weighing
out
and
arranging
allowances
for
the
returning
party
and
arranging
the
stores
and
distribution
of
weights
of
the
two
parties
going
on
the
temperature
was
down
to
zero
the
lowest
it
has
been
for
some
time
this
summer
weather
there
is
a
very
mournful
air
those
going
on
and
those
turning
back
bill
came
in
while
i
was
cooking
to
say
he
told
me
he
fully
expected
to
come
back
with
the
next
party
that
he
could
see
scott
was
going
to
take
on
the
strongest
fellows
perhaps
three
seamen
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
if
bill
did
not
go
on
we
gave
away
any
gear
which
we
could
spare
to
those
going
on
and
i
find
the
following
in
my
diary
i
have
been
trying
to
give
away
my
spare
gear
where
it
may
be
most
acceptable
finnesko
to
birdie
pyjama
trousers
to
bill
and
a
bag
of
baccy
for
bill
to
give
scott
on
christmas
day
some
baccy
to
titus
jaeger
socks
and
half
my
scarf
to

and
a
bit
of
handkerchief
to
birdie
very
tired

we
are
struggling

the
polar
journey
people
perhaps
still
exist
who
believe
that
it
is
of
no
importance
to
explore
the
unknown
polar
regions
this
of
course
shows
ignorance
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
mention
here
of
what
scientific
importance
it
is
that
these
regions
should
be
thoroughly
explored
the
history
of
the
human
race
is
a
continual
struggle
from
darkness
towards
light
it
is
therefore
to
no
purpose
to
discuss
the
use
of
knowledge
man
wants
to
know
and
when
he
ceases
to
do
so
he
is
no

oates
lashly
seaman
evans
crean
for
the
first
week
on
the
plateau
bowers
wrote
a
full
diary
which
i
give
below
after
december
there
are
little
more
than
fragmentary
notes
until
january
the
day
the
party
started
to
return
from
the
pole
from
then
until
january
he
wrote
fully
nothing
after
that
until
january
followed
by
more
fragments
to
february
i
suppose
that
is
the
last
entry
he
made
but
this
is
not
surprising
even
in
a
man
of
bowers
energy
the
time
a
man
can
give
to
writing
under
such
conditions
is
limited
and
bowers
had
a
great
deal
of
it
to
do
before
he
could
think
of
a
diary
the
meteorological
log
sights
for
position
as
well
as
rating
sights
for
time
and
all
the
routine
work
of
weights
provisions
and
depôts
he
wrote
no
diary
at
the
pole
but
he
made
a
very
full
meteorological
report
while
there
in
addition
to
working
out
sights
the
wonder
is
that
he
kept
a
diary
at
all
bowers
december
we
have
had
a
brilliant
day
with
a
temperature
about
zero
and
no
wind
altogether
charming
conditions
i
rigged
up
the
upper
glacier
depôt
after
breakfast
we
depôted
two
units
for
return
of
the
two
parties
also
all
crampons
and
glacier
gear
such
as
crowbar
spare
alpine
rope
personal
gear
medical
and
in
fact
everything
we
could
dispense
with
i
left
my
old
finnesko
wind
trousers
and
some
other
spare
gear
in
a
bag
for
going
back
the
two
advance
parties
weights
amounted
to
lbs
per
man
they
consisted
of
the
permanent
weights
twelve
weeks
food
and
oil
spare
sledge
runners
etc
we
said
and
sent
back
messages
and
photo
films
with
the
first
returning
party
which
consisted
of
atch
cherry
silas
and
keohane
it
was
quite
touching
saying
farewell
to
our
good
pals
they
wished
us
luck
and
cherry
atch
and
silas
quite
overwhelmed
me
we
went
forward
the
owner
team
as
before
consisting
of
bill
titus
and
seaman
evans
and
lieut
teddy
evans
and
lashly
coming
over
to
my
sledge
and
tent
to
join
up
with
crean
and
myself
we
all
left
the
depôt
cairn
marked
with
two
spare
sledge
runners
and
a
large
black
flag
on
one
our
morning
march
was
not
so
long
as
usual
owing
to
making
up
the
depôt
but
we
did
five
miles
uphill
hauling
our
heavier
loads
more
easily
than
the
lighter
ones
yesterday
a
fall
in
the
temperature
had
improved
the
surface
we
had
also
sandpapered
our
runners
after
the
tearing
up
they
had
had
on
the
glacier
this
made
a
tremendous
difference
the
afternoon
march
brought
our
total
up
to
miles
for
the
day
on
a
course
we
are
steering
with
a
view
to
avoiding
which
shackleton
met
with
we
came
across
very
few
crevasses
the
few
we
found
were
as
broad
as
a
street
and
crossing
them
the
whole
party
sledge
and
all
would
be
on
the
bridge
at
once
they
only
gave
way
at
the
edges
and
we
did
nothing
worse
than
put
our
feet
through
now
and
then
the
surface
is
all
snow
now
névé
and
hard
sastrugi
which
seem
to
point
to
a
strong
prevalent
wind
here
we
are
well
clear
of
the
land
now
and
it
is
a
beautiful
evening
i
have
just
taken
six
photographs
of
the
dominion
range
we
can
see
many
new
mountains
our
position
by
observation
is
variation
being
december
turned
out
at
usual
time
i
am
cook
this
week
in
our
tent
after
breakfast
built
two
cairns
to
mark
spot
and
shoved
off
at
quarter
to
eight
we
started
up
a
big
slope
on
a
course
to
avoid
the
pressure
which
lay
across
our
track
to
the
southward
it
was
a
pretty
useful
slog
up
the
rise
at
one
time
it
seemed
as
if
we
would
never
top
the
slope
we
stopped
for
five
minutes
to
look
round
after
hours
hard
plugging
and
about
hours
later
reached
the
top
from
which
we
could
see
the
distant
mountains
which
have
so
recently
been
our
companions
they
are
beginning
to
look
pretty
magnificent
the
top
of
the
great
pressure
ridge
was
running
roughly
and
it
was
one
of
a
succession
of
ridges
which
probably
cover
an
area
of
fifty
or
sixty
square
miles
in
this
neighbourhood
shackleton
met
them
almost
to
south
at
the
top
of
the
ridge
were
vast
crevasses
into
which
we
could
have
dropped
the
terra
nova
easily
the
bridges
were
firm
however
except
at
the
sides
though
we
had
frequent
stumbles
into
the
conservatory
roof
so
to
speak
the
sledges
were
rushed
over
them
without
mishap
we
had
to
head
farther
west
to
clear
disturbances
and
at
one
time
were
going
at
lunch
camp
we
had
done
miles
and
in
the
afternoon
we
completed
fifteen
on
a
course
over
improved
ground
our
routine
is
to
actually
haul
our
sledges
for
nine
hours
a
day
five
in
the
morning
till
and
four
in
the
afternoon
we
turn
out
at
just
now
the
loads
are
still
pretty
heavy
but
the
surface
is
remarkably
good
considering
all
things
one
gets
pretty
weary
towards
the
end
of
the
day
all
my
muscles
have
had
their
turn
at
being
stiffened
up
these
hills
are
giving
my
back
ones
a
reminder
but
they
will
ache
less
and
finally
cease
to
do
so
as
is
the
case
with
legs
which
had
their
turn
first
december
we
started
off
heading
due
south
this
morning
as
we
are
many
miles
to
the
westward
of
shackleton
course
and
should
if
anywhere
be
clear
of
the
and
pressure
of
course
no
mortals
having
been
here
one
can
only
conjecture
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
found
later
in
the
day
that
we
were
not
clear
by
any
means
and
had
to
do
a
bit
of
dodging
about
to
avoid
disturbances
as
well
as
mount
vast
ridges
with
the
tops
of
them
a
chaos
of
crevasses
the
tops
are
pretty
hard
over
which
the
sledges
run
easily
it
is
quite
a
holiday
after
slogging
up
the
slopes
on
the
softer
surface
with
our
heavy
loads
which
amount
to
over
lbs
per
man
we
mark
our
night
camp
by
two
cairns
and
our
lunch
camp
by
single
ones
it
is
doubtful
however
among
these
ridges
if
we
will
ever
pick
them
up
again
and
it
does
not
really
matter
as
we
have
excellent
land
for
the
upper
glacier
depôt
we
completed
fourteen
miles
and
turned
in
as
usual
pretty
tired
december
a
strange
and
strenuous
christmas
for
me
with
plenty
of
snow
to
look
at
and
very
little
else
the
breeze
that
had
blown
in
our
faces
all
yesterday
blew
more
freshly
with
surface
drift
it
fairly
nipped
one
nose
and
face
starting
off
until
one
got
warmed
up
we
had
to
pull
in
wind
blouses
as
though
one
body
kept
warm
enough
on
the
march
the
arms
got
numbed
with
the
penetrating
wind
no
matter
how
vigorously
they
were
swung
another
thing
is
that
one
can
not
stop
the
team
on
the
march
to
get
clothes
on
and
off
so
it
is
better
to
go
the
whole
hog
and
be
too
hot
than
cause
delays
we
had
the
addition
of
a
little
pony
meat
for
breakfast
to
celebrate
the
day
i
am
the
cook
of
our
tent
this
week
we
steered
south
again
and
struck
our
friends
the
crevasses
and
climbed
ridges
again
about
the
middle
of
the
morning
we
were
all
falling
in
continually
but
lashly
in
my
team
had
the
worst
drop
he
fell
to
the
length
of
his
harness
and
the
trace
i
was
glad
that
having
noticed
his
rope
rather
worn
i
had
given
him
a
new
one
a
few
days
before
he
jerked
crean
and
me
off
our
feet
backwards
and
crean
harness
being
jammed
under
the
sledge
which
was
half
across
an
bridge
he
could
do
nothing
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
sledge
and
all
going
down
but
fortunately
the
crevasse
ran
diagonally
we
could
not
see
lashly
for
a
great
overhanging
piece
of
ice
was
over
him
teddy
evans
and
i
cleared
crean
and
we
all
three
got
lashly
up
with
the
alpine
rope
cut
into
the
snow
sides
which
overhung
the
hole
we
then
got
the
sledge
into
safety
is
lashly
birthday
he
is
married
and
has
a
family
is
years
of
age
and
due
for
his
pension
from
the
service
he
is
as
strong
as
most
and
is
an
undefeated
old
sportsman
being
a
chief
stoker
his
original
job
was
charge
of
one
of
the
motor
sledges
the
following
is
lashly
own
account
christmas
day
and
a
good
one
we
have
done
miles
over
a
very
changing
surface
first
of
all
it
was
very
much
crevassed
and
pretty
rotten
we
were
often
in
difficulties
as
to
which
way
we
should
tackle
it
i
had
the
misfortune
to
drop
clean
through
but
was
stopped
with
a
jerk
when
at
the
end
of
my
harness
it
was
not
of
course
a
very
nice
sensation
especially
on
christmas
day
and
being
my
birthday
as
well
while
spinning
round
in
space
like
i
was
it
took
me
a
few
seconds
to
gather
together
my
thoughts
and
see
what
kind
of
a
place
i
was
in
it
certainly
was
not
a
place
when
i
had
collected
myself
i
heard
some
one
calling
from
above
you
all
right
lashly
i
was
all
right
it
is
true
but
i
did
not
care
to
be
dangling
in
the
air
on
a
piece
of
rope
especially
when
i
looked
round
and
saw
what
kind
of
a
place
it
was
it
seemed
about
feet
deep
and
feet
wide
and
feet
long
this
information
i
had
ample
time
to
gain
while
dangling
there
i
could
measure
the
width
with
my
ski
sticks
as
i
had
them
on
my
wrists
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
i
saw
the
rope
come
down
alongside
me
with
a
bowline
in
it
for
me
to
put
my
foot
in
and
get
dragged
out
it
was
not
a
job
i
should
care
to
have
to
go
through
often
as
by
being
in
the
crevasse
i
had
got
cold
and
a
bit
on
the
hands
and
face
which
made
it
more
difficult
for
me
to
help
myself
anyhow
evans
bowers
and
crean
hauled
me
out
and
crean
wished
me
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
and
of
course
i
thanked
him
politely
and
the
others
laughed
but
all
were
pleased
i
was
not
hurt
bar
a
bit
of
a
shake
it
was
funny
although
they
called
to
the
other
team
to
stop
they
did
not
hear
but
went
trudging
on
and
did
not
know
until
they
looked
round
just
in
time
to
see
me
arrive
on
top
again
they
then
waited
for
us
to
come
up
with
them
the
captain
asked
if
i
was
all
right
and
could
go
on
again
which
i
could
honestly
say
to
and
at
night
when
we
stopped
for
dinner
i
felt
i
could
do
two
dinners
in
anyhow
we
had
a
pretty
good
dinner
consisted
of
pemmican
biscuits
chocolate
éclair
pony
meat
plum
pudding
and
crystallized
ginger
and
four
caramels
each
we
none
of
us
could
hardly
move
we
had
done
over
eight
miles
at
lunch
i
had
managed
to
scrape
together
from
the
barrier
rations
enough
extra
food
to
allow
us
a
stick
of
chocolate
each
for
lunch
with
two
spoonfuls
of
raisins
each
in
our
tea
in
the
afternoon
we
got
clear
of
crevasses
pretty
soon
but
towards
the
end
of
the
afternoon
captain
scott
got
fairly
wound
up
and
went
on
and
on
the
breeze
died
down
and
my
breath
kept
fogging
my
glasses
and
our
windproofs
got
oppressively
warm
and
altogether
things
were
pretty
rotten
at
last
he
stopped
and
we
found
we
had
done
miles
he
said
what
about
fifteen
miles
for
christmas
day
so
we
gladly
went
on
anything
definite
is
better
than
indefinite
trudging
we
had
a
great
feed
which
i
had
kept
hidden
and
out
of
the
official
weights
since
our
departure
from
winter
quarters
it
consisted
of
a
good
fat
hoosh
with
pony
meat
and
ground
biscuit
a
chocolate
hoosh
made
of
water
cocoa
sugar
biscuit
raisins
and
thickened
with
a
spoonful
of
arrowroot
this
is
the
most
satisfying
stuff
imaginable
then
came
square
inches
of
each
and
a
good
mug
of
cocoa
washed
down
the
whole
in
addition
to
this
we
had
four
caramels
each
and
four
squares
of
crystallized
ginger
i
positively
could
not
eat
all
mine
and
turned
in
feeling
as
if
i
had
made
a
beast
of
myself
i
wrote
up
my
journal
in
fact
i
should
have
liked
somebody
to
put
me
to
bed
december
we
have
seen
many
new
ranges
of
mountains
extending
to
the
of
the
dominion
range
they
are
very
distant
however
and
must
evidently
be
the
top
of
those
bounding
the
barrier
they
could
only
be
seen
from
the
tops
of
the
ridges
as
waves
up
which
we
are
continually
mounting
our
height
yesterday
morning
by
hypsometer
was
feet
that
is
our
last
hypsometer
record
as
i
had
the
misfortune
to
break
the
thermometer
the
hypsometer
was
one
of
my
chief
delights
and
nobody
could
have
been
more
disgusted
than
myself
at
its
breaking
however
we
have
the
aneroid
to
check
the
height
we
are
going
gradually
up
and
up
as
one
would
expect
a
considerable
amount
of
lassitude
was
felt
over
breakfast
after
our
feed
last
night
the
last
thing
on
earth
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
ship
the
harness
round
my
poor
tummy
when
we
started
as
usual
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
south
and
a
temperature
of
blew
in
our
faces
strange
to
say
however
we
do
get
i
suppose
it
is
the
life
i
could
not
tell
if
i
had
a
on
my
face
now
as
it
is
all
scales
so
are
my
lips
and
nose
a
considerable
amount
of
red
hair
is
endeavouring
to
cover
up
matters
we
crossed
several
ridges
and
after
the
effects
of
had
worn
off
did
a
pretty
good
march
of
thirteen
miles
no
more
christmas
days
so
no
more
big
hooshes
december
there
is
something
the
matter
with
our
sledge
or
our
team
as
we
have
an
awful
slog
to
keep
up
with
the
others
i
asked
bill
and
he
said
their
sledge
ran
very
easily
ours
is
nothing
but
a
desperate
drag
with
constant
rallies
to
keep
up
we
certainly
manage
to
do
so
but
i
am
sure
we
can
not
keep
this
up
for
long
we
are
all
pretty
well
done
up
after
doing
miles
our
salvation
is
on
the
summits
of
the
ridges
where
hard
névé
and
sastrugi
obtain
and
we
skip
over
this
slippery
stuff
and
make
up
lost
ground
easily
in
soft
snow
the
other
team
draw
steadily
ahead
and
it
is
fairly
to
know
you
are
putting
your
life
out
hour
after
hour
while
they
go
along
with
little
apparent
effort
december
the
last
few
days
have
been
absolutely
cloudless
with
unbroken
sunshine
for
hours
it
sounds
very
nice
but
the
temperature
never
comes
above
zero
and
what
shackleton
called
the
pitiless
increasing
wind
of
the
great
plateau
continues
to
blow
at
all
times
from
the
south
it
never
ceases
and
all
night
it
whistles
round
the
tents
all
day
it
blows
in
our
faces
sometimes
it
is
or
to
and
sometimes
even
to
but
always
southerly
chiefly
accompanied
by
low
drift
which
at
night
forms
quite
a
deposit
round
the
sledges
we
expected
this
wind
so
we
must
not
growl
at
getting
it
it
will
be
great
fun
sailing
the
sledges
back
before
it
as
far
as
weather
is
concerned
we
have
had
remarkably
fine
days
up
here
on
this
limitless
snow
plain
i
should
like
to
know
what
there
is
beneath
us
mountains
and
valleys
simply
levelled
off
to
the
top
with
ice
we
constantly
come
across
disturbances
which
i
can
only
imagine
are
caused
by
the
peaks
of
mountains
and
no
doubt
some
of
the
and
crevasses
are
accountable
to
the
same
source
our
coming
west
has
not
cleared
them
as
we
have
seen
more
disturbances
to
the
west
many
miles
away
however
they
are
getting
less
and
less
and
are
now
nothing
but
featureless
rises
with
apparently
no
crevasses
our
first
two
hours
pulling
lashly
december
a
nasty
head
wind
all
day
and
low
drift
which
accumulates
in
patches
and
makes
it
the
deuce
of
a
job
to
get
along
we
have
got
to
put
in
long
days
to
do
the
distance
december
sledges
going
heavy
surface
and
wind
the
same
as
yesterday
we
depôted
our
ski
that
is
the
party
returning
when
we
march
in
the
forenoon
and
camp
to
change
our
sledge
runners
into
feet
done
miles
but
a
bit
stiff
december
after
doing
miles
we
camped
and
done
the
sledges
which
took
us
until
and
we
had
to
dig
out
to
get
them
done
by
then
made
a
depôt
and
saw
the
old
year
out
and
the
new
year
in
we
all
wondered
where
we
should
be
next
new
year
it
was
so
still
and
quiet
the
weather
was
dull
and
overcast
all
night
in
fact
we
have
not
seen
much
of
the
sun
lately
it
would
be
so
nice
if
we
could
sometimes
get
a
glimpse
of
it
the
sun
is
always
cheering
january
year
we
pushed
on
as
usual
but
were
rather
late
getting
away
something
unusual
for
us
to
be
as
late
the
temperature
and
wind
is
still
very
troublesome
we
are
now
ahead
of
shackleton
dates
and
have
passed
the
parallel
so
it
is
only
miles
to
the
pole
january
the
dragging
is
still
very
heavy
and
we
seem
to
be
always
climbing
higher
we
are
now
over
feet
above
sea
level
it
makes
it
bad
as
we
do
get
enough
heat
in
our
food
and
the
tea
is
not
strong
enough
to
run
out
of
the
pot
everything
gets
cold
so
quickly
the
water
boils
at
about
scott
own
diary
of
this
first
fortnight
on
the
plateau
shows
the
immense
shove
of
the
man
he
was
getting
every
inch
out
of
the
miles
every
ounce
out
of
his
companions
also
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
always
was
that
blizzard
which
had
delayed
him
just
before
the
gateway
and
the
resulting
surfaces
which
had
delayed
him
in
the
lower
reaches
of
the
glacier
one
can
feel
the
averages
running
through
his
brain
so
many
miles
so
many
more
when
shall
we
come
to
an
end
of
this
pressure
can
we
go
straight
or
must
we
go
more
west
and
then
the
great
undulating
waves
with
troughs
eight
miles
wide
and
the
buried
mountains
causing
whirlpools
in
the
ice
how
immense
and
how
annoying
the
monotonous
march
the
necessity
to
keep
the
mind
concentrated
to
steer
amongst
disturbances
the
relief
of
a
steady
plod
when
the
disturbances
cease
for
a
time
then
more
pressure
and
more
crevasses
always
slog
on
slog
on
always
a
fraction
of
a
mile
more
on
december
he
writes
we
have
caught
up
shackleton
dates
they
made
wonderful
marches
averaging
nearly
fifteen
statute
miles
geog
a
day
for
the
marches
until
the
second
return
party
turned
back
on
january
scott
writes
on
december
it
seems
astonishing
to
be
disappointed
with
a
march
of
statute
miles
when
i
had
contemplated
doing
little
more
than
with
full
loads
the
last
returning
party
came
back
with
the
news
that
scott
must
reach
the
pole
with
the
greatest
ease
this
seemed
almost
a
certainty
and
yet
it
was
as
we
know
now
a
false
impression
scott
plans
were
based
on
shackleton
averages
over
the
same
country
the
blizzard
came
and
put
him
badly
behind
but
despite
this
he
caught
shackleton
up
no
doubt
the
general
idea
then
was
that
scott
was
going
to
have
a
much
easier
time
than
he
had
expected
we
certainly
did
not
realize
then
and
i
do
not
think
scott
himself
had
any
notion
of
the
price
which
had
been
paid
of
the
three
teams
of
four
men
each
which
started
from
the
bottom
of
the
beardmore
scott
team
was
a
very
long
way
the
strongest
it
was
the
team
which
with
one
addition
went
to
the
pole
lieutenant
evans
team
had
mostly
done
a
lot
of
already
it
was
hungry
and
i
think
a
bit
stale
bowers
team
was
fresh
and
managed
to
keep
up
for
the
most
part
but
it
was
very
done
at
the
end
of
the
day
scott
own
team
went
along
with
comparative
ease
from
the
top
of
the
glacier
two
teams
went
on
during
the
last
fortnight
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
the
first
of
them
was
scott
unit
complete
just
as
it
had
pulled
up
the
glacier
the
second
team
consisted
i
believe
of
the
men
whom
scott
considered
to
be
the
strongest
two
from
evans
team
and
two
from
bowers
all
team
were
fresh
to
the
extent
that
they
had
done
no
until
we
started
up
the
glacier
but
two
of
the
other
team
lieutenant
evans
and
lashly
had
been
since
the
breakdown
of
the
second
motor
on
november
they
had
four
hundred
statute
miles
farther
than
the
rest
indeed
lashly
journey
from
corner
camp
to
beyond
and
back
is
one
of
the
great
feats
of
polar
travelling
surely
and
not
very
slowly
scott
team
began
to
wear
down
the
other
team
they
were
going
easily
when
the
others
were
making
heavy
weather
and
were
sometimes
far
behind
during
the
fortnight
they
rose
according
to
the
corrected
observations
from
feet
upper
glacier
depôt
to
feet
above
sea
level
three
degree
depôt
the
rarefied
air
of
the
plateau
with
its
cold
winds
and
lower
temperatures
just
now
about
to
at
night
and
during
the
day
were
having
their
effect
on
the
second
team
as
well
as
the
forced
marches
this
is
quite
clear
from
scott
diary
and
from
the
other
diaries
also
what
did
not
appear
until
after
the
last
returning
party
had
turned
homewards
was
that
the
first
team
was
getting
worn
out
too
this
team
which
had
gone
so
strong
up
the
glacier
which
had
done
those
amazingly
good
marches
on
the
plateau
broke
up
unexpectedly
and
in
some
respects
rapidly
from
the
parallel
onwards
seaman
evans
was
the
first
man
to
crack
he
was
the
heaviest
largest
most
muscular
man
we
had
and
that
was
probably
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
his
allowance
of
food
was
the
same
as
the
others
but
one
mishap
which
contributed
to
his
collapse
seems
to
have
happened
during
this
first
fortnight
on
the
plateau
on
december
the
sledges
were
turned
into
ones
by
stripping
off
the
old
scratched
runners
which
had
come
up
the
glacier
and
shipping
new
ones
which
had
been
brought
for
the
purpose
this
job
was
done
by
the
seamen
and
evans
appears
to
have
had
some
accident
to
his
hand
which
is
mentioned
several
times
afterwards
meanwhile
scott
had
to
decide
whom
he
was
going
to
take
on
with
him
to
the
pole
for
it
was
becoming
clear
that
in
all
probability
he
reach
the
pole
what
castles
one
builds
now
hopefully
that
the
pole
is
ours
he
wrote
the
day
after
the
supporting
party
left
him
the
final
advance
to
the
pole
was
according
to
plan
to
have
been
made
by
four
men
we
were
organized
in
units
our
rations
were
made
up
for
four
men
for
a
week
our
tents
held
four
men
our
cookers
held
four
mugs
four
pannikins
and
four
spoons
four
days
before
the
supporting
party
turned
scott
ordered
the
second
sledge
of
four
men
to
depôt
their
ski
it
is
clear
i
suppose
that
at
this
time
he
meant
the
polar
party
to
consist
of
four
men
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
meant
one
of
those
men
to
be
himself
for
your
own
ear
also
i
am
exceedingly
fit
and
can
go
with
the
best
of
them
he
wrote
from
the
top
of
the
glacier
he
changed
his
mind
and
went
forward
a
party
of
five
scott
wilson
bowers
oates
and
seaman
evans
i
am
sure
he
wished
to
take
as
many
men
as
possible
to
the
pole
he
sent
three
men
back
lieutenant
evans
in
charge
and
two
seamen
lashly
and
crean
it
is
the
vivid
story
of
those
three
men
who
turned
on
january
in
latitude
which
is
told
by
lashly
in
the
next
chapter
scott
wrote
home
a
last
note
from
a
hopeful
position
i
think
it
going
to
be
all
right
we
have
a
fine
party
going
forward
and
arrangements
are
all
going
well

months

why
that

the

as

i
admit
the
cowardice
as
universal
as
sea
sickness

matters
just
as
little
but
that
about
putting
an
idea
into

man
head
is
stuff
and
nonsense
in
a
battle
all
you
need
to
make
you
fight
is
a
little
hot
blood
and
the
knowledge
that
it
more
dangerous
to
lose
than
to
win
don
juan
that
is
perhaps
why
battles
are
so
useless
but
men
never
really
overcome
fear
until
they
imagine
they
are

to
further
a
universal
purpose
fighting

turned

at

of
the

after
having
been
brought
forward
farther
than
had
been
intended
i
will
speak
later
i
am
going
to
say
very
little
about
the
first
return
party
which
consisted
of
atkinson
wright
keohane
and
myself
atkinson
was
in
command
and
before
we
left
scott
told
him
to
bring
the
out
to
meet
the
polar
party
if
as
seemed
likely
meares
returned
home
atkinson
is
a
naval
surgeon
and
you
will
find
this
party
referred
to
in
diary
as
the
doctor
it
was
a
sad
job
saying
it
was
thick
snowing
and
drifting
clouds
when
we
started
back
after
making
the
depôt
and
the
last
we
saw
of
them
as
we
swung
the
sledge
north
was
a
black
dot
just
disappearing
over
the
next
ridge
and
a
big
white
pressure
wave
ahead
of
them
scott
said
some
nice
things
when
we
said
anyway
he
has
only
to
average
seven
miles
a
day
to
get
to
the
pole
on
full
rations
practically
a
cert
for
him
i
do
hope
he
takes
bill
and
birdie
the
view
over
the
and
pressure
by
the
mill
glacier
from
the
top
of
the
is
one
of
the
finest
things
i
have
ever
seen
atch
is
doing
us
proud
no
five
hundred
mile
journey
down
the
beardmore
and
across
the
barrier
can
be
uneventful
even
in
midsummer
we
had
the
same
dreary
drag
the
same
thick
weather
fears
and
anxieties
which
other
parties
have
had
a
touch
of
the
same
dysentery
and
sickness
the
same
tumbles
and
crevasses
the
same
christmas
comforts
a
layer
of
plum
pudding
at
the
bottom
of
our
cocoa
and
some
rocks
collected
from
a
moraine
under
the
cloudmaker
the
same
groping
for
tracks
the
same
cairns
lost
and
found
the
same
and
weariness
nightmares
food
dreams
why
repeat
comparatively
speaking
it
was
a
very
little
journey
and
yet
the
distance
from
cape
evans
to
the
top
of
the
beardmore
glacier
and
back
is
statute
miles
scott
southern
journey
of
was
statute
miles
one
day
only
is
worth
recalling
we
got
into
the
same
big
pressure
above
the
cloudmaker
which
both
the
other
parties
experienced
but
where
the
other
two
parties
made
east
to
get
out
of
it
we
went
west
at
suggestion
west
was
right
the
day
really
lives
in
my
memory
because
of
the
troubles
of
keohane
he
fell
into
crevasses
to
the
full
length
of
his
harness
eight
times
in
minutes
little
wonder
he
looked
a
bit
dazed
and
atkinson
went
down
into
one
chasm
head
foremost
the
worst
crevasse
fall
i
ever
seen
but
luckily
the
shoulder
straps
of
his
harness
stood
the
strain
and
we
pulled
him
up
little
the
worse
all
three
parties
off
the
plateau
owed
a
good
deal
to
meares
who
on
his
return
with
the
two
built
up
the
cairns
which
had
been
obliterated
by
the
big
blizzard
of
december
the
ponies
walls
were
drifted
level
with
the
surface
and
meares
himself
had
an
anxious
time
finding
his
way
home
the
dog
tracks
also
helped
us
a
good
deal
the
dogs
were
sinking
deeply
and
making
heavy
weather

first
return
party
at
the
barrier
depôts
we
found
rather
despondent
notes
from
meares
about
his
progress
to
the
southern
barrier
depôt
he
had
uncomfortably
high
temperatures
and
a
very
soft
surface
and
found
the
cairns
drifted
up
and
hard
to
see
at
the
middle
barrier
depôt
we
found
a
note
from
him
dated
december
thick
weather
and
blizzards
had
delayed
him
and
once
he
had
got
right
off
the
tracks
and
had
been
out
from
his
camp
hunting
for
them
they
were
quite
well
a
little
eye
strain
from
searching
for
cairns
he
was
taking
a
little
butter
from
each
bag
of
the
three
depôted
weekly
units
and
with
this
would
have
enough
to
the
next
depôt
on
short
rations
at
the
upper
glacier
depôt
mount
hooper
the
news
from
meares
was
dated
christmas
eve
in
the
evening
the
dogs
were
going
slowly
but
steadily
in
very
soft
stuff
especially
his
last
two
days
he
was
running
short
of
food
having
only
biscuit
crumbs
tea
some
cornflour
and
half
a
cup
of
pemmican
he
was
therefore
taking
fifty
biscuits
and
a
day
provisions
for
two
men
from
each
of
our
units
he
had
killed
one
american
dog
some
camps
back
if
he
killed
more
he
was
going
to
kill
krisravitza
who
he
said
was
the
fattest
and
laziest
we
shall
take
on
thirty
biscuits
short
meares
was
to
have
turned
homewards
with
the
two
in
lat
scott
took
him
on
to
approximately
the
dogs
had
the
ponies
on
which
to
feed
to
make
up
the
deficiency
of
we
went
one
biscuit
a
day
short
when
going
up
the
beardmore
but
the
dogs
went
back
slower
than
was
estimated
and
his
provisions
were
insufficient
it
was
evident
that
the
would
arrive
too
late
and
be
too
done
to
take
out
the
food
which
had
still
to
be
sledged
to
one
ton
for
the
three
parties
returning
from
the
plateau
it
was
uncertain
whether
a
party
with
such
of
this
food
as
they
could
drag
would
arrive
at
the
depôt
before
us
we
might
have
to
travel
the
geographical
miles
from
one
ton
to
hut
point
on
the
little
food
which
was
already
at
that
depôt
and
we
were
saving
food
by
going
on
short
rations
to
meet
this
contingency
if
it
arose
judge
therefore
our
joy
when
we
reached
one
ton
in
the
evening
of
january
to
find
three
of
the
five
xs
rations
which
were
necessary
for
the
three
parties
a
party
consisting
of
day
nelson
hooper
and
clissold
had
brought
out
this
food
they
left
a
note
saying
the
crevasses
near
corner
camp
were
bad
and
open
day
and
hooper
had
reached
cape
evans
from
the
barrier
on
december
they
started
out
again
on
this
trip
on
december
it
is
a
common
experience
for
men
who
have
been
hungry
to
be
ill
after
reaching
plenty
of
food
atkinson
was
not
at
all
well
during
our
journey
in
to
hut
point
which
we
reached
without
difficulty
on
january
when
i
was
looking
for
data
concerning
the
return
of
the
last
supporting
party
of
which
no
account
has
been
published
i
wrote
to
lashly
and
asked
him
to
meet
and
tell
me
all
he
could
remember
he
was
very
willing
and
added
that
somewhere
or
other
he
had
a
diary
which
he
had
written
perhaps
it
might
be
of
use
i
asked
him
to
send
it
me
and
was
sent
some
dirty
thumbed
sheets
of
paper
and
this
is
what
i
read
january
very
heavy
going
this
will
be
our
last
night
together
as
we
are
to
return
after
going
on
in
the
forenoon
with
the
party
chosen
for
the
pole
that
is
capt
scott
wilson
capt
oates
lieut
bowers
and
taff
evans
the
captain
said
he
was
satisfied
we
were
all
in
good
condition
fit
to
do
the
journey
but
only
so
many
could
go
on
so
it
was
his
wish
evans
crean
and
myself
should
return
he
was
quite
aware
we
should
have
a
very
stiff
job
but
we
told
him
we
did
not
mind
that
providing
he
thought
they
could
reach
the
pole
with
the
assistance
we
had
been
able
to
give
them
the
first
time
i
have
heard
we
were
having
mules
coming
down
to
assist
us
next
year
i
was
offering
to
remain
at
hut
point
to
be
there
if
any
help
was
needed
but
the
captain
said
it
was
his
and
also
capt
oates
wish
if
the
mules
arrived
i
was
to
take
charge
of
and
look
after
them
until
their
return
but
if
they
did
not
arrive
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
not
come
to
hut
point
and
wait
their
return
we
had
a
long
talk
with
the
owner
scott
in
our
tent
about
things
in
general
and
he
seemed
pretty
confident
of
success
he
seemed
a
bit
afraid
of
us
getting
hung
up
but
as
he
said
we
had
a
splendid
navigator
who
he
was
sure
he
could
trust
to
pull
us
through
he
also
thanked
us
all
heartily
for
the
way
we
had
assisted
in
the
journey
and
he
should
be
sorry
when
we
parted
we
are
of
course
taking
the
mail
but
what
a
time
before
we
get
back
to
send
it
we
are
nearly
as
far
as
shackleton
was
on
his
journey
i
shall
not
write
more
it
is
too
cold
january
we
accompanied
the
pole
party
for
about
five
miles
and
everything
seemed
to
be
going
pretty
well
and
capt
scott
said
they
felt
confident
they
could
pull
the
load
quite
well
so
there
was
no
more
need
for
us
to
go
on
farther
so
we
stopped
and
did
all
the
talking
we
could
in
a
short
time
we
wished
them
every
success
and
a
safe
return
and
asked
each
one
if
there
was
anything
we
could
do
for
them
when
we
got
back
but
they
were
all
satisfied
they
had
left
nothing
undone
so
the
time
came
for
the
last
handshake
and
i
think
we
all
felt
it
very
much
they
then
wished
us
a
speedy
return
and
safe
and
then
they
moved
off
we
gave
them
three
cheers
and
watched
them
for
a
while
until
we
began
to
feel
cold
then
we
turned
and
started
for
home
we
soon
lost
sight
of
each
other
we
travelled
a
long
time
so
as
to
make
the
best
of
it
while
the
weather
was
suitable
as
we
have
to
keep
up
a
good
pace
on
the
food
allowance
it
wont
do
to
lay
up
much
one
thing
since
we
left
mt
darwin
we
have
had
weather
we
could
travel
in
although
we
have
not
seen
the
sun
much
of
late
we
did
miles
as
near
as
we
can
guess
by
the
cairns
we
have
passed
we
have
not
got
a
sledge
meter
so
shall
have
to
go
by
guess
all
the
way
home
owing
to
the
loss
of
a
sledge
meter
on
the
beardmore
glacier
one
of
the
three
parties
had
to
return
without
one
a
sledge
meter
gives
the
navigator
his
dead
reckoning
indicating
the
miles
travelled
like
the
log
of
a
ship
to
be
deprived
of
it
in
a
wilderness
of
snow
without
landmarks
adds
enormously
to
the
difficulties
and
anxieties
of
a
sledge
party
january
we
were
up
and
off
this
morning
the
weather
being
fine
but
the
surface
is
about
the
same
the
temperature
keeps
low
we
have
got
to
change
our
pulling
billets
crean
has
become
through
being
leader
so
i
shall
have
the
job
as
evans
seems
to
get
blind
rather
quickly
so
if
i
lead
and
he
directs
me
from
behind
we
ought
to
get
along
pretty
well
i
hope
my
eyes
will
keep
alright
we
made
good
miles
and
camped
january
we
are
making
good
progress
on
the
surface
we
have
to
contend
with
we
picked
up
the
degree
depôt
soon
after
noon
which
puts
us
up
to
time
we
took
our
provision
for
a
week
we
have
got
to
reach
mt
darwin
depôt
a
distance
of
miles
with
days
provisions
we
picked
up
our
ski
and
camped
for
the
night
we
have
been
wondering
if
the
others
have
got
the
same
wind
as
us
if
so
it
is
right
in
their
face
whereas
it
is
at
our
back
a
treat
to
what
it
is
facing
it
crean
eyes
are
pretty
bad
is
an
awful
complaint
and
no
one
i
can
assure
you
looks
forward
with
pleasure
when
it
begins
to
attack
january
we
have
had
a
very
good
day
as
far
as
travelling
goes
the
wind
has
been
behind
us
and
is
a
great
help
to
us
we
have
been
on
ski
all
day
for
the
first
time
it
seems
a
good
change
to
footing
it
the
one
thing
day
after
day
gets
on
one
nerves
crean
eyes
are
a
bit
better
but
far
from
being
well
the
temperature
is
pretty
low
which
dont
improve
the
surface
for
hauling
but
we
seem
to
be
getting
along
pretty
well
we
have
no
sledge
meter
so
we
have
to
go
by
guess
evans
says
we
done
miles
but
i
say
i
am
not
going
to
our
day
run
as
i
am
taking
charge
of
the
biscuits
so
that
we
dont
the
mark
this
we
have
all
agreed
to
so
that
we
should
exactly
know
how
we
stand
from
day
to
day
i
am
still
leading
not
very
nice
as
the
light
is
bad
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
land
to
the
east
of
us
but
could
only
have
been
a
mirage
january
on
turning
out
this
morning
we
found
it
was
blowing
a
bliz
so
it
was
almost
a
case
of
having
to
remain
in
camp
but
on
second
thoughts
we
thought
it
best
to
kick
off
as
we
cant
afford
to
lay
up
on
account
of
food
so
thought
it
best
to
push
on
i
wonder
if
the
pole
party
have
experienced
this
if
so
they
could
not
travel
as
it
would
be
in
their
face
where
we
have
got
it
at
our
back
we
have
lost
the
outward
bound
track
so
have
decided
to
make
a
straight
line
to
mt
darwin
which
will
be
on
shackleton
course
according
to
his
and
wild
diary
each
of
the
three
parties
which
went
forward
up
the
beardmore
glacier
carried
extracts
from
the
above
diaries
wild
was
shackleton
man
in
his
southern
journey
in
january
travelling
is
very
difficult
bad
light
and
still
blizzing
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
cairns
in
this
weather
i
am
giving
miles
the
weather
have
moderated
a
bit
and
looks
a
bit
more
promising
can
see
land
at
times
january
the
light
is
still
very
bad
with
a
good
deal
of
drift
but
we
must
push
on
as
we
are
a
long
way
from
our
depôt
but
we
hope
to
reach
it
before
our
provisions
run
out
i
am
keeping
a
good
eye
on
them
crean
eyes
have
got
alright
again
now
january
things
are
a
bit
better
could
see
the
land
alright
and
where
to
steer
for
it
is
so
nice
to
have
something
to
look
at
but
i
am
thinking
we
shall
all
have
our
work
cut
out
to
reach
the
depôt
before
our
provisions
run
short
i
am
deducting
a
small
portion
each
meal
so
that
we
shall
not
have
to
go
without
altogether
if
we
do
bring
up
at
the
proper
time
have
done
about
miles
january
the
day
has
been
full
of
adventure
at
first
we
got
into
some
very
rough
stuff
with
plenty
of
crevasses
had
to
get
rid
of
the
ski
and
put
our
thinking
cap
on
as
we
had
not
got
under
way
long
before
we
were
at
the
top
of
some
these
probably
are
what
shackleton
spoke
of
we
could
see
it
meant
a
descent
of
feet
or
make
a
big
circuit
which
meant
a
lot
of
time
and
a
big
delay
and
this
we
cant
afford
just
now
so
we
decided
on
the
descent
into
the
valley
this
proved
a
difficult
task
as
we
had
no
crampons
having
left
them
at
mt
darwin
depôt
but
we
managed
after
a
time
by
getting
hold
of
the
sledge
each
side
and
allowing
her
to
run
into
a
big
lump
of
pressure
which
was
we
knew
a
risky
thing
to
do
it
took
us
up
to
lunch
time
to
reach
the
valley
where
we
camped
for
lunch
where
we
all
felt
greatly
relieved
having
accomplished
the
thing
safely
no
damage
to
ourselves
or
the
sledge
but
we
lost
one
of
crean
ski
sticks
some
of
the
crevasses
we
crossed
were
to
feet
wide
but
well
bridged
in
the
centre
but
the
edges
were
very
dangerous
indeed
this
is
where
the
snow
and
ice
begins
to
roll
down
the
glacier
after
starting
on
our
way
again
we
found
we
had
to
climb
the
hill
things
dont
look
very
nice
ahead
again
we
dont
seem
to
be
more
than
a
day
run
from
the
depôt
but
it
will
surprise
me
if
we
reach
it
by
night
if
not
we
shall
have
to
go
on
short
rations
as
our
supply
is
nearly
run
out
and
we
have
not
lost
any
time
but
we
knew
on
starting
we
had
to
average
miles
per
day
to
reach
it
in
time
january
this
has
been
a
very
bad
day
for
us
what
with
and
crevasses
we
feel
all
full
up
the
strain
is
tremendous
some
days
we
are
camped
but
not
at
the
depôt
but
we
hope
to
pick
it
up
some
time
we
shall
be
glad
to
get
off
the
summit
as
the
temperature
is
very
low
we
expected
the
party
would
have
reached
the
pole
yesterday
providing
they
had
anything
of
luck
scott
reached
the
pole
on
january
january
sunday
we
reached
the
mt
darwin
depôt
at
and
camped
for
lunch
we
had
just
enough
now
for
our
meal
this
is
cutting
it
a
bit
fine
we
have
now
taken
our
days
allowance
which
has
got
to
take
us
another
miles
to
the
cloudmaker
depôt
this
we
shall
do
if
we
all
keep
as
fit
as
we
seem
just
now
we
left
a
note
at
the
depôt
to
inform
the
captain
of
our
safe
arrival
wishing
them
the
best
of
a
journey
home
we
are
quite
cheerful
here
after
having
put
things
right
at
the
depôt
where
we
found
the
sugar
exposed
to
the
sun
it
had
commenced
to
melt
but
we
put
everything
alright
before
we
left
and
picked
up
our
crampons
and
got
away
as
soon
as
we
could
we
know
there
is
not
much
time
to
spare
we
are
now
beginning
to
descend
rapidly
it
is
quite
warm
and
our
tea
and
food
is
warmer
things
are
going
pretty
favourable
we
are
looking
forward
to
making
good
runs
down
the
glacier
we
have
had
some
very
heavy
dragging
lately
up
the
sharp
rises
we
found
on
the
outward
journey
after
a
sharp
rise
we
found
a
long
gradual
run
down
two
and
three
miles
in
length
we
noticed
this
on
our
outward
journey
and
remarked
on
it
but
coming
back
the
long
uphill
drag
we
found
out
was
pretty
heavy
work
january
had
a
good
run
but
the
ice
was
very
rough
and
very
much
crevassed
but
with
crampons
on
we
made
splendid
progress
we
did
not
like
to
stop
but
we
thought
it
would
not
be
advisable
to
overdo
our
strength
as
it
is
a
long
way
to
go
yet
january
we
made
good
headway
again
but
we
camped
in
some
very
rough
ice
and
pressure
ridges
we
are
under
the
impression
we
are
slightly
out
of
our
proper
course
but
evans
thinks
we
cant
be
very
far
out
either
way
and
crean
and
i
are
of
the
same
opinion
according
to
the
marks
on
the
land
anyhow
we
hope
to
get
out
of
it
in
the
morning
and
make
the
cloudmaker
depôt
by
night
we
shall
then
feel
safe
but
the
weather
dont
look
over
promising
again
i
am
thinking
so
far
we
have
not
had
to
stop
for
weather
we
have
wondered
if
the
pole
party
have
been
as
lucky
with
the
weather
as
we
have
they
ought
by
now
to
be
homeward
bound
we
have
more
chance
now
of
writing
as
the
temperature
is
much
better
down
here
we
have
been
discussing
how
the
dogs
got
home
and
also
the
progress
made
by
the
doctor
atkinson
party
they
ought
to
be
nearing
home
we
have
thought
of
the
time
it
will
take
us
to
reach
it
at
the
rate
we
are
getting
along
now
january
we
have
experienced
what
we
none
of
us
ever
wants
to
be
our
lot
again
i
can
not
describe
the
maze
we
got
into
and
the
hairbreadth
escapes
we
have
had
to
pass
through
this
day
we
shall
remember
all
our
lives
the
more
we
tried
to
get
clear
the
worse
the
pressure
got
at
times
it
seemed
almost
impossible
for
us
to
get
along
and
when
we
had
got
over
the
places
it
was
more
than
we
could
face
to
try
and
retreat
so
we
struggled
on
for
hours
to
try
and
free
ourselves
but
everything
seemed
against
us
i
was
leading
with
a
long
trace
so
that
i
could
get
across
some
of
the
ridges
when
we
thought
it
possible
to
get
the
sledge
over
without
being
dashed
down
into
the
fathomless
pits
each
side
of
us
which
were
too
numerous
to
think
of
often
and
often
we
saw
openings
where
it
was
possible
to
drop
the
biggest
ship
afloat
in
and
loose
her
this
is
what
we
have
travelled
over
all
day
it
has
been
a
great
strain
on
us
all
and
evans
is
rather
down
and
thinks
he
has
led
us
into
such
a
hole
but
as
we
have
told
him
it
is
no
fault
of
his
as
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
coming
down
the
glacier
to
see
what
is
ahead
of
them
so
we
must
be
thankful
that
we
are
so
far
safe
we
seem
to
be
in
a
better
place
we
have
camped
not
being
able
to
reach
the
depôt
which
we
are
certain
is
not
far
off
dont
want
many
days
like
this
illustration
below
the
cloudmaker
january
we
started
off
all
in
good
spirits
trusting
we
should
be
able
to
reach
the
depôt
all
in
good
time
but
we
had
not
got
far
before
we
came
into
pressure
far
worse
than
we
were
in
yesterday
my
god
what
a
day
this
have
been
for
us
all
i
can
not
describe
what
we
really
have
come
through
no
one
could
believe
that
we
came
through
with
safety
if
we
had
only
had
a
camera
we
could
have
obtained
some
photographs
that
would
have
surprised
anyone
living
we
travelled
all
day
with
very
little
food
as
we
are
a
day
and
a
half
overdue
but
when
we
got
clear
i
can
say
clear
now
because
i
am
dotting
down
this
at
the
depôt
where
we
have
arrived
i
had
managed
to
keep
behind
just
a
small
amount
of
biscuit
and
a
drop
of
tea
to
liven
us
up
to
try
and
reach
the
depôt
which
we
reached
at
after
one
of
the
most
trying
days
of
my
life
shall
have
reason
to
never
forget
the
and
of
january
evans
is
complaining
of
his
eyes
more
trouble
ahead
january
after
putting
the
depôt
in
order
and
things
we
kicked
off
again
for
lower
glacier
depôt
evans
eyes
were
very
bad
on
starting
this
morning
but
we
made
a
pretty
good
start
i
picked
some
rock
which
i
intend
to
try
and
get
back
with
as
it
is
the
only
chance
we
have
had
of
getting
any
up
to
the
present
and
it
seemed
a
funny
thing
the
rock
i
got
some
pieces
of
looked
as
if
someone
before
me
had
been
chipping
some
off
i
wonder
if
it
was
the
doctor
party
but
we
could
not
see
any
trace
of
their
sledge
but
we
could
account
for
that
as
it
was
all
blue
ice
and
not
likely
to
leave
any
marks
behind
after
travelling
for
some
distance
we
got
on
the
same
ridge
as
we
ran
along
on
the
outward
journey
and
passed
what
we
took
to
be
the
doctor
xmas
camp
we
had
not
gone
far
past
before
we
got
into
soft
snow
so
we
decided
to
camp
for
lunch
evans
eyes
being
very
bad
indeed
we
are
travelling
now
on
our
own
i
am
leading
and
telling
him
the
course
i
am
steering
that
is
the
different
marks
on
the
mountains
but
we
shall
keep
on
this
ridge
for
some
distance
yet
after
lunch
we
did
not
proceed
far
before
we
decided
to
camp
the
surface
being
so
bad
and
evans
eyes
so
bad
we
thought
it
would
do
us
all
good
to
have
a
rest
last
night
we
left
a
note
for
capt
scott
but
did
not
say
much
about
our
difficulties
just
above
the
cloudmaker
as
it
would
be
better
to
tell
him
when
we
see
him
january
we
did
not
get
away
very
smart
but
as
we
found
the
surface
very
soft
we
decided
to
go
on
ski
evans
is
still
suffering
with
his
eyes
and
badly
after
getting
his
ski
on
we
tied
him
on
to
the
trace
so
that
he
could
help
to
drag
a
bit
when
we
were
troubling
about
the
ridges
we
came
over
on
our
outward
journey
but
strange
to
say
we
never
encountered
any
ridges
at
all
and
the
surface
although
very
soft
was
the
best
i
have
ever
sledged
over
ever
since
i
have
been
at
it
we
fancied
on
our
left
or
to
the
west
we
saw
what
we
took
to
be
the
ridges
what
we
seem
to
have
missed
altogether
although
evans
have
been
blind
and
could
not
see
anything
at
all
we
have
made
splendid
progress
and
covered
at
least
miles
as
near
as
we
can
guess
we
passed
one
of
the
doctor
homeward
bound
camps
and
kept
on
their
track
for
some
time
but
finally
lost
it
we
are
camped
and
we
all
feel
confident
we
shall
if
the
weather
remains
good
reach
the
depôt
night
january
sunday
we
started
off
as
usual
again
on
ski
the
weather
again
being
favourable
evans
eyes
is
still
bad
but
improving
it
will
be
a
good
job
when
they
are
better
i
picked
up
our
outward
bound
course
soon
after
we
started
this
morning
and
asked
evans
if
i
should
try
and
keep
it
as
it
will
save
him
the
trouble
of
directing
me
and
another
thing
we
came
out
without
going
through
any
crevasses
and
i
have
noticed
a
good
many
crevasses
what
seems
to
be
very
dangerous
ones
and
on
two
occasions
where
our
sledges
on
the
outward
journey
had
gone
over
two
of
the
crevasses
had
fallen
through
we
accomplished
the
journey
from
the
cloudmaker
to
this
depôt
in
three
days
we
all
feel
quite
proud
of
our
performance
evans
is
a
lot
better
and
old
tom
is
giving
us
a
song
while
he
is
covering
up
the
tent
with
snow
we
have
the
depôt
and
left
our
usual
note
for
capt
scott
wishing
them
a
speedy
return
we
hope
to
see
and
reach
the
barrier
and
be
clear
of
the
beardmore
for
ever
we
none
of
us
minds
the
struggle
we
have
been
through
to
attain
the
amount
of
success
so
far
reached
it
is
all
for
the
good
of
science
as
crean
says
we
reached
the
depôt
at
illustration
from
mount
kyffin
to
mount
patrick
wilson
del
emery
walker
limited
collotypers
january
we
made
a
good
start
this
morning
and
evans
eyes
is
got
pretty
well
alright
again
so
things
looks
a
bit
brighter
after
starting
we
soon
got
round
the
corner
from
the
granite
pillars
to
between
the
mainland
and
mt
hope
on
rising
up
on
the
slope
between
the
mountain
and
the
mainland
as
soon
as
we
sighted
the
barrier
crean
let
go
one
huge
yell
enough
to
frighten
the
ponies
out
of
their
graves
of
snow
and
no
more
beardmore
for
me
after
this
when
we
began
to
descend
on
to
the
barrier
it
only
required
one
of
us
to
drag
the
sledge
down
to
within
a
mile
of
the
pony
and
sledge
depôt
after
exchanging
our
sledge
as
arranged
picking
up
a
small
amount
of
pony
meat
and
fitted
up
bamboo
for
mast
so
that
we
shall
be
able
to
fix
up
a
sail
when
favourable
we
proceeded
on
our
way
to
cross
the
barrier
we
have
now
miles
to
travel
geographically
to
get
to
hut
point
evans
complained
to
me
while
outside
the
tent
that
he
had
a
stiffness
at
the
back
of
his
legs
behind
the
knees
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
it
was
and
he
said
could
not
account
for
it
so
if
he
dont
soon
get
rid
of
it
i
am
to
have
a
look
and
see
if
anything
is
the
matter
with
him
as
i
know
from
what
i
have
seen
and
been
told
before
the
symptoms
of
scurvy
is
pains
and
swelling
behind
the
knee
round
the
ankle
and
loosening
of
the
teeth
ulcerated
gums
i
watched
to
see
his
gums
and
i
am
convinced
he
is
on
the
point
of
something
anyhow
and
this
i
have
spoken
to
crean
about
but
he
dont
seem
to
realise
it
but
i
have
asked
him
to
wait
developments
for
a
time
it
seems
we
are
in
for
more
trouble
now
but
lets
hope
for
the
best
january
we
got
away
pretty
well
and
did
a
good
journey
having
covered
about
miles
over
a
fairly
good
surface
we
have
passed
the
blizzard
camp
and
glad
of
it
too
again
we
saw
in
several
places
where
the
bridges
on
the
crevasses
had
fallen
through
a
good
job
they
none
of
them
fell
through
when
we
were
going
over
them
as
the
width
would
have
taken
all
through
with
them
and
in
every
case
where
they
had
fallen
through
was
where
we
had
gone
over
as
the
mark
of
the
sledge
was
very
distinct
in
each
case
evans
seems
better
january
did
a
good
run
over
a
good
surface
the
weather
have
been
very
warm
not
much
to
write
as
everything
is
going
well
january
started
off
in
very
thick
weather
the
temperature
is
very
high
and
the
snow
is
wet
and
clogging
all
day
on
our
ski
which
made
dragging
heavy
and
towards
evening
it
got
worse
after
lunch
we
got
a
good
breeze
for
an
hour
when
it
changed
to
a
blizzard
and
almost
rained
we
saw
the
depôt
ahead
sometimes
so
we
tried
to
reach
it
as
we
thought
we
might
be
in
for
another
few
days
like
we
had
near
the
land
on
our
outward
journey
anyhow
we
reached
it
after
a
tremendous
struggle
owing
to
the
wet
and
bad
light
i
took
off
my
ski
and
carried
them
on
my
shoulder
to
finish
up
the
last
half
a
mile
the
blizzard
died
down
after
we
had
camped
and
turned
in
for
the
night
looked
at
the
thermometer
which
showed
january
this
have
been
a
most
wonderful
day
for
surface
this
morning
when
we
started
the
thermometer
stood
at
much
too
high
for
sledging
we
were
on
ski
or
we
might
have
been
on
stilts
for
the
amount
of
snow
clogging
on
our
ski
dont
know
how
we
should
have
got
on
without
our
ski
as
the
snow
was
so
very
soft
we
sank
right
in
when
we
tried
to
go
on
foot
but
we
were
fortunate
to
get
the
wind
behind
us
and
able
to
make
use
of
the
sail
we
made
a
very
good
day
of
it
did
miles
of
this
after
lunch
i
did
not
feel
well
outside
the
tent
this
morning
i
came
over
quite
giddy
and
faint
but
it
passed
off
quickly
and
have
felt
no
more
of
it
all
day
january
we
had
a
good
run
with
the
sail
up
it
only
required
one
of
us
to
keep
it
straight
no
need
whatever
to
pull
but
it
was
very
hot
anyone
could
take
off
all
their
clothes
and
march
it
is
really
too
hot
for
this
part
of
the
world
but
i
daresay
we
shall
soon
get
it
a
bit
colder
did
miles
it
is
nice
to
be
able
to
see
the
tracks
and
cairns
of
our
outward
journey
we
feel
satisfied
when
we
have
done
a
good
day
and
in
good
time
evans
is
now
suffering
from
looseness
of
the
bowels
crean
had
a
touch
of
it
a
few
days
ago
but
he
is
quite
alright
again
january
it
have
been
a
very
heavy
drag
the
snow
is
still
very
soft
and
the
sun
very
hot
it
fairly
scorches
anyone
face
we
are
almost
black
now
and
our
hair
is
long
and
getting
white
through
being
exposed
to
the
light
it
gets
bleached
i
am
glad
to
say
it
is
cooler
generally
we
got
over
miles
again
evans
is
still
very
loose
in
his
bowels
this
of
course
hinders
us
as
we
have
had
to
stop
several
times
only
another
few
more
sundays
and
we
hope
to
be
safely
housed
at
hut
point
or
cape
evans
we
have
now
been
out
days
january
another
good
day
was
helped
by
the
sail
all
day
one
man
could
again
manage
for
about
two
hours
the
weather
is
still
very
warm
plus
again
did
miles
only
to
the
next
depôt
evans
is
still
suffering
from
the
same
complaint
have
come
to
the
conclusion
to
stop
his
pemmican
as
i
feel
that
it
have
got
something
to
do
with
him
being
out
of
sorts
anyhow
we
are
going
to
try
it
gave
him
a
little
brandy
and
he
is
taking
some
chalk
and
opium
pills
to
try
and
stop
it
his
legs
are
getting
worse
and
we
are
quite
certain
he
is
suffering
from
scurvy
at
least
he
is
turning
black
and
blue
and
several
other
colours
as
well
january
very
bad
light
but
fair
wind
picked
up
the
depôt
this
evening
did
the
miles
quite
in
good
time
after
taking
our
food
we
found
a
shortage
of
oil
and
have
taken
what
we
think
will
take
us
to
the
next
depôt
there
seems
to
have
been
some
leakage
in
the
one
can
but
how
we
could
not
account
for
that
we
have
left
a
note
telling
capt
scott
how
we
found
it
but
they
will
have
sufficient
to
carry
them
on
to
the
next
depôt
but
we
all
know
the
amount
of
oil
allowed
on
the
journey
is
enough
but
if
any
waste
takes
place
it
means
extra
precautions
in
the
handling
of
it
evans
is
still
without
pemmican
and
seems
to
have
somewhat
recovered
from
the
looseness
but
things
are
not
by
a
long
way
with
him
as
they
should
be
only
two
more
depôts
now
to
pick
up
january
another
very
good
run
but
the
light
being
very
bad
we
had
to
continually
stop
and
steer
by
compass
this
a
difficult
task
especially
as
there
was
no
wind
to
help
keep
on
the
course
but
it
have
cleared
again
the
temperature
is
plus
in
the
day
and
at
night
just
now
did
miles
evans
is
allowed
a
little
pemmican
as
the
work
is
hard
and
it
wants
a
little
warm
food
to
put
life
into
anyone
in
this
part
of
the
world
february
we
had
a
very
fine
day
but
a
very
heavy
pull
but
we
did
miles
evans
and
myself
have
been
out
days
i
have
had
to
change
my
shirt
again
this
is
the
last
clean
side
i
have
got
i
have
been
wearing
two
shirts
and
each
side
will
now
have
done
duty
next
the
skin
as
i
have
changed
round
each
month
and
i
have
certainly
found
the
benefit
of
it
and
on
the
point
we
all
three
agree
evans
is
still
gradually
worse
it
is
no
good
closing
our
eyes
to
the
fact
we
must
push
on
as
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
yet
february
a
very
bad
light
again
could
not
make
much
progress
only
did
miles
but
we
must
think
ourselves
lucky
we
have
not
had
to
lay
up
and
get
delayed
but
we
have
had
the
wind
and
more
behind
us
otherwise
we
should
have
had
to
stop
evans
is
no
better
but
seems
to
be
in
great
pain
but
he
keeps
quite
cheerful
we
are
pleased
to
say
february
this
morning
we
were
forced
to
put
evans
on
his
ski
and
strap
him
on
as
he
could
not
lift
his
legs
i
looked
at
them
again
and
found
they
are
rapidly
getting
worse
things
are
looking
serious
on
his
part
but
we
have
been
trying
to
pump
him
up
he
will
get
through
alright
but
he
begins
to
think
different
himself
but
if
we
get
to
one
ton
and
can
get
a
change
of
food
it
may
relieve
him
he
is
a
brick
there
is
plenty
of
pluck
one
can
not
but
admire
such
pluck
the
light
have
been
dreadful
all
day
and
i
seemed
to
have
got
a
bit
depressed
at
times
not
being
able
to
see
anything
to
know
where
i
was
on
the
course
or
not
and
not
getting
a
word
from
evans
i
deliberately
went
off
the
course
to
see
if
anyone
was
taking
notice
but
to
my
surprise
i
was
quickly
told
i
was
off
the
course
this
i
thought
but
wanted
to
know
if
he
was
looking
out
which
he
was
it
came
on
to
bliz
after
we
camped
we
ought
to
reach
mt
hooper
night
february
started
in
splendid
weather
but
the
surface
was
bad
and
dragging
was
very
heavy
but
it
improved
as
the
day
went
on
and
we
arrived
at
the
depôt
at
we
are
now
miles
from
hut
point
and
this
sunday
night
we
hope
to
be
only
two
more
sundays
on
the
barrier
no
improvement
in
evans
much
worse
we
have
taken
out
our
food
and
left
nearly
all
the
pemmican
as
we
dont
require
it
on
account
of
none
of
us
caring
for
it
therefore
we
are
leaving
it
behind
for
the
others
they
may
require
it
we
have
left
our
note
and
wished
them
every
success
on
their
way
but
we
have
decided
it
is
best
not
to
say
anything
about
evans
being
ill
or
suffering
from
scurvy
this
old
cairn
have
stood
the
weather
and
is
still
a
huge
thing
february
had
a
very
fine
day
and
a
good
light
all
day
which
makes
things
much
more
cheerful
did
not
get
away
before
but
we
did
miles
it
is
gradually
getting
colder
evans
is
still
getting
worse
he
is
suffering
from
looseness
in
the
bowels
shall
have
to
stop
his
pemmican
february
another
fine
day
but
sun
was
very
hot
and
caused
us
to
sweat
a
good
deal
but
we
dont
mind
as
we
are
pretty
used
to
such
changes
we
shall
soon
be
looking
for
land
ahead
which
will
be
mt
discovery
or
mt
erebus
we
have
miles
to
go
to
hut
point
done
alright
again
miles
we
do
wonderfully
well
especially
as
evans
have
got
to
go
very
slowly
first
off
after
stopping
until
he
gets
the
stiffness
out
of
his
legs
but
he
is
suffering
a
good
deal
and
in
silence
he
never
complains
but
he
dont
get
much
sleep
we
shall
all
be
glad
when
we
arrive
at
one
ton
where
there
is
a
change
of
food
for
us
all
the
pemmican
is
too
much
especially
when
the
weather
is
warm
february
a
very
fine
day
but
heavy
going
we
are
bringing
the
land
in
sight
the
day
have
been
simply
lovely
did
miles
no
better
luck
with
our
patient
he
gets
along
without
a
murmur
we
have
got
to
help
him
in
and
out
of
the
tent
but
we
have
consulted
on
the
matter
and
he
is
determined
to
go
to
the
last
which
we
know
is
not
far
off
as
it
is
difficult
for
him
to
stand
but
he
is
the
essence
of
a
brick
to
keep
it
up
but
we
shall
have
to
drag
him
on
the
sledge
when
he
cant
go
any
further
february
have
been
very
favourable
and
fine
we
had
a
good
breeze
and
set
sail
after
lunch
if
we
get
a
good
day
we
hope
to
reach
one
ton
evans
have
passed
a
good
deal
of
blood
which
makes
things
look
a
lot
worse
i
have
to
do
nearly
everything
for
him
now
february
a
very
fine
day
and
quite
warm
reached
the
depôt
at
and
we
all
had
a
good
feed
of
oatmeal
oh
what
a
to
get
a
change
of
food
we
have
taken
enough
food
for
days
which
if
we
still
keep
up
our
present
rate
of
progress
it
ought
to
take
us
in
to
hut
point
we
can
not
take
too
heavy
a
load
as
there
is
only
the
two
of
us
pulling
now
and
this
our
last
port
of
call
before
we
reach
hut
point
but
things
are
not
looking
any
too
favourable
for
us
as
our
leader
is
gradually
getting
lower
every
day
it
is
almost
impossible
for
him
to
get
along
and
we
are
still
miles
from
hut
point
february
we
did
a
good
march
in
very
thick
weather
we
are
camped
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
evans
is
in
a
very
bad
state
if
this
is
scurvy
i
am
sorry
for
anyone
it
attacks
we
shall
do
our
utmost
to
get
him
back
alive
although
he
is
so
ill
he
is
very
cheerful
which
is
very
good
and
tries
to
do
anything
to
help
us
along
we
are
thinking
the
food
now
we
have
got
a
change
may
improve
things
i
am
very
pleased
to
say
crean
and
myself
are
in
the
best
of
health
which
we
are
thankful
for
february
we
built
a
cairn
and
left
all
our
gear
we
could
do
without
as
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
drag
the
load
now
and
evans
we
think
is
doing
well
as
long
as
he
can
keep
on
his
legs
we
have
had
a
very
bad
light
all
day
and
we
have
a
bliz
on
us
so
we
had
to
camp
early
our
day
run
has
been
miles
we
are
now
about
miles
from
our
base
february
we
did
not
get
away
until
on
account
of
bad
weather
but
after
we
put
evans
on
his
ski
he
went
on
slowly
it
is
against
our
wish
to
have
to
send
him
on
a
little
in
advance
but
it
is
best
as
we
shall
have
to
drag
him
out
of
this
we
are
certain
he
has
fainted
on
two
or
three
occasions
but
after
a
drop
of
brandy
he
has
been
able
to
proceed
but
it
is
very
awkward
especially
as
the
temperature
is
so
low
we
are
afraid
of
his
getting
our
progress
is
very
slow
the
light
is
very
bad
and
it
is
seldom
we
see
the
land
february
we
got
away
in
good
time
but
progress
was
slow
and
evans
could
not
go
and
we
consulted
awhile
and
came
to
the
conclusion
it
would
be
best
to
put
him
on
the
sledge
otherwise
he
may
not
pull
through
so
we
stopped
and
camped
and
decided
to
drop
everything
we
can
possibly
do
without
so
we
have
only
got
our
sleeping
bags
cooker
and
what
little
food
and
oil
we
have
left
our
load
is
not
much
but
evans
on
the
sledge
makes
it
pretty
heavy
work
for
us
both
but
he
says
he
is
comfortable
now
this
morning
he
wished
us
to
leave
him
but
this
we
could
not
think
of
we
shall
stand
by
him
to
the
end
one
way
or
other
so
we
are
the
masters
he
has
got
to
do
as
we
wish
and
we
hope
to
pull
him
through
this
morning
when
we
depôted
all
our
gear
i
changed
my
socks
and
got
my
foot
badly
frostbitten
and
the
only
way
was
to
fetch
it
round
so
although
evans
was
so
bad
he
proposed
to
stuff
it
on
his
stomach
to
try
and
get
it
right
again
i
did
not
like
to
risk
such
a
thing
as
he
is
certainly
very
weak
but
we
tried
it
and
it
succeeded
in
bringing
it
round
thanks
to
his
thoughtfulness
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
kindness
bestowed
on
me
at
a
critical
time
in
our
travels
but
i
think
we
could
go
to
any
length
of
trouble
to
assist
one
another
in
such
time
and
such
a
place
we
must
trust
in
a
higher
power
to
pull
us
through
when
we
pack
up
now
and
have
to
move
off
we
have
to
get
everything
ready
before
we
attempt
to
move
the
tent
as
it
is
impossible
for
our
leader
now
to
stand
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
get
him
ready
before
we
start
we
then
pull
the
sledge
alongside
his
bag
and
lift
him
on
to
it
and
strap
him
on
it
is
a
painful
piece
of
work
and
he
takes
it
pretty
well
but
we
ca
help
hurting
him
as
it
is
very
awkward
to
lift
him
the
snow
being
soft
and
the
light
so
bad
but
he
dont
complain
the
only
thing
we
hear
him
grind
his
teeth
february
another
good
start
after
the
usual
preparation
we
have
not
got
much
to
pack
but
it
takes
us
some
time
to
get
our
invalid
ready
the
surface
is
very
bad
and
our
progress
is
very
slow
but
we
have
proposed
to
go
longer
hours
and
try
to
cover
the
distance
that
is
if
we
can
stick
it
ourselves
february
we
started
in
fine
weather
this
morning
but
it
soon
came
over
thick
and
progress
became
slow
we
had
to
continually
consult
the
compass
as
we
have
had
no
wind
to
assist
us
but
after
awhile
the
sun
peeped
out
and
the
wind
sprang
up
and
we
were
able
to
set
sail
which
helped
us
put
in
a
good
march
february
it
have
been
a
very
heavy
drag
all
day
and
the
light
is
very
bad
but
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
castle
rock
and
observation
hill
we
uncovered
evans
to
let
him
have
a
look
and
we
have
reduced
our
ration
now
to
one
half
as
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
reach
hut
point
under
four
days
that
is
if
everything
goes
favourable
with
us
february
it
has
been
thick
this
morning
soon
after
we
started
we
saw
what
we
thought
was
the
dog
tent
the
two
going
out
to
meet
the
polar
party
a
thing
we
had
been
looking
for
to
try
and
get
relief
but
when
we
came
up
to
it
we
found
it
was
only
a
piece
of
biscuit
box
stuck
on
an
old
camp
for
a
guide
it
shows
how
deceiving
the
things
here
are
i
can
tell
you
our
hopes
were
raised
but
on
reaching
it
they
dropped
again
considerably
we
were
able
to
see
the
land
occasionally
and
during
one
of
the
breaks
this
afternoon
we
spotted
the
motor
oh
what
joy
we
again
uncovered
evans
to
let
him
have
a
look
and
after
trudging
along
for
another
three
hours
we
brought
up
alongside
it
and
camped
for
the
night
we
are
now
only
a
little
over
miles
from
hut
point
if
we
could
only
see
the
dogs
approaching
us
but
they
we
think
may
have
passed
us
while
the
weather
have
been
thick
evans
is
getting
worse
every
day
we
are
almost
afraid
to
sleep
at
night
as
he
seems
very
weak
if
the
temperature
goes
much
lower
it
will
be
a
job
to
keep
him
warm
we
have
found
some
biscuits
here
at
the
motor
but
nothing
else
but
that
will
assist
greatly
on
our
way
the
slogging
have
been
heavy
all
day
we
are
pretty
tired
i
dont
think
we
have
got
the
go
in
us
we
had
but
we
must
try
and
push
on
february
i
started
to
move
evans
this
morning
but
he
completely
collapsed
and
fainted
away
crean
was
very
upset
and
almost
cried
but
i
told
him
it
was
no
good
to
create
a
scene
but
put
up
a
bold
front
and
try
to
assist
i
really
think
he
thought
evans
had
gone
but
we
managed
to
pull
him
through
we
used
the
last
drop
of
brandy
after
awhile
we
got
him
on
the
sledge
and
proceeded
as
usual
but
finding
the
surface
very
bad
and
we
were
unable
to
make
less
than
a
mile
an
hour
we
stopped
and
decided
to
camp
we
told
evans
of
our
plans
which
were
crean
should
proceed
it
being
a
splendid
day
on
foot
to
hut
point
to
obtain
relief
if
possible
this
we
had
agreed
to
between
ourselves
i
offered
to
do
the
journey
and
crean
remain
behind
but
tom
said
he
would
much
rather
i
stayed
with
the
invalid
and
look
after
him
so
i
thought
it
best
i
should
remain
and
these
plans
were
agreed
to
by
all
of
us
so
after
we
had
camped
the
next
thing
was
the
food
problem
we
had
about
a
provisions
with
extra
biscuit
taken
from
the
motor
and
a
little
extra
oil
taken
from
the
same
place
so
we
gave
crean
what
he
thought
he
could
manage
to
accomplish
the
journey
of
miles
geographical
on
which
was
a
little
chocolate
and
biscuits
we
put
him
up
a
little
drink
but
he
would
not
carry
it
what
a
pity
we
did
not
have
some
ski
but
we
dumped
them
to
save
weight
so
crean
sailed
away
in
splendid
weather
for
a
try
to
bring
relief
i
was
in
a
bit
of
a
sweat
all
day
and
remained
up
to
watch
the
weather
till
long
after
midnight
i
was
afraid
of
the
weather
but
it
kept
clear
and
i
thought
he
might
have
reached
or
got
within
easy
distance
of
hut
point
but
there
was
the
possibility
of
his
dropping
down
a
crevasse
but
that
we
had
to
leave
to
chance
but
none
the
more
it
was
anxious
moments
as
if
it
comes
on
to
drift
the
weather
is
very
treacherous
in
these
parts
after
crean
left
i
left
evans
and
proceeded
to
corner
camp
which
was
about
a
mile
away
to
see
if
there
was
any
provisions
left
there
that
would
be
of
use
to
us
i
found
a
little
butter
a
little
cheese
and
a
little
treacle
that
had
been
brought
there
for
the
ponies
i
also
went
back
to
the
motor
and
got
a
little
more
oil
while
the
weather
was
fine
i
also
got
a
large
piece
of
burbery
and
tied
on
a
long
bamboo
and
stuck
up
a
big
flag
on
our
sledge
so
that
anyone
could
not
pass
our
way
without
seeing
us
or
our
flag
i
found
a
note
left
at
corner
camp
by
day
saying
there
was
a
lot
of
very
bad
crevasses
between
there
and
the
sea
ice
especially
off
white
island
this
put
me
in
a
bit
of
a
fix
as
i
of
course
at
once
thought
of
crean
he
being
on
foot
was
more
likely
to
go
down
than
he
would
had
he
been
on
ski
i
did
not
tell
evans
anything
about
the
crevasses
as
i
certainly
thought
it
would
be
best
kept
from
him
i
just
told
him
the
note
was
there
and
all
was
well
february
evans
seems
a
bit
better
and
more
cheerful
the
rest
will
do
him
good
and
assist
in
getting
a
little
strength
we
have
been
wondering
when
relief
will
reach
us
but
we
can
not
expect
it
for
at
least
a
day
or
two
yet
at
the
earliest
it
was
very
thick
this
morning
and
also
very
cold
the
temperature
is
dropping
rapidly
our
tent
was
all
covered
in
frost
rime
a
sure
sign
of
colder
weather
it
was
very
thick
this
morning
but
cleared
as
the
day
advanced
but
we
could
not
see
hut
point
i
wonder
if
poor
old
tom
reached
alright
we
have
very
little
food
now
except
biscuit
but
oil
is
better
we
have
got
gallon
and
if
relief
dont
come
for
some
time
we
shall
be
able
to
have
hot
water
when
all
other
things
are
gone
i
have
thought
out
a
plan
for
the
future
in
case
of
no
relief
coming
but
of
course
we
took
all
things
into
consideration
in
case
of
failure
but
we
must
hope
for
the
best
of
course
i
know
it
is
no
use
thinking
of
evans
being
able
to
move
any
further
as
he
cant
stand
at
all
the
only
thing
is
we
may
have
missed
the
dogs
if
so
there
is
still
a
chance
of
someone
being
at
hut
point
i
am
cold
now
and
can
not
write
more
we
lose
the
sun
at
midnight
now
if
all
had
went
well
we
should
have
been
home
by
now
february
tuesday
not
a
nice
day
a
low
drift
all
the
morning
and
increased
to
a
blizzard
at
times
have
had
to
remain
in
the
tent
all
day
to
try
and
keep
warm
have
not
got
much
food
except
biscuits
evans
is
about
the
same
but
quite
cheerful
we
have
had
whole
journey
over
and
over
it
have
passed
these
three
days
away
we
have
wondered
how
they
are
getting
on
behind
us
we
have
worked
it
out
and
they
ought
to
be
on
the
barrier
now
with
anything
of
luck
we
have
been
gambling
on
the
condition
of
the
ice
and
the
possibility
of
the
open
water
at
hut
point
at
any
time
now
and
also
about
what
news
of
home
although
home
is
one
of
the
foremost
thoughts
we
hardly
ever
mention
it
only
what
we
are
going
to
have
to
eat
when
we
do
arrive
there
i
think
we
have
got
everything
that
is
good
down
on
our
list
of
course
new
zealand
have
got
to
be
answerable
for
a
good
deal
plenty
of
apples
we
are
going
to
have
and
some
nice
cake
not
too
rich
as
we
think
we
can
eat
more
i
wonder
if
the
mules
will
have
arrived
as
i
am
to
look
after
them
till
capt
oates
returns
as
anton
will
be
gone
home
or
at
least
going
soon
we
shall
have
to
hurry
up
as
the
ship
is
to
leave
again
on
the
of
march
as
it
is
not
safe
to
remain
longer
in
these
regions
i
am
now
too
cold
to
write
and
i
dont
seem
settled
at
all
and
the
weather
is
still
pretty
bad
outside
so
we
are
not
going
to
look
for
anything
to
come
along
hark
from
us
both
yes
it
is
the
dogs
near
relief
at
last
who
is
there
i
did
not
stay
to
think
more
before
i
was
outside
the
tent
yes
sir
it
is
alright
the
doctor
and
dimitri
how
did
you
see
us
the
flag
lash
says
dimitri
the
doctor
how
is
mr
evans
alright
but
low
but
this
had
a
good
effect
on
him
after
the
first
few
minutes
we
got
their
tent
pitched
and
the
food
they
brought
us
i
was
soon
on
the
way
preparing
a
meal
for
us
all
but
evans
can
not
have
pemmican
but
the
doctor
have
brought
everything
that
will
do
him
good
some
onions
to
boil
and
several
other
things
dimitri
brought
along
a
good
lump
of
cake
we
are
in
clover
after
the
doctor
had
examined
my
patient
and
we
got
through
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
everything
we
could
think
of
especially
home
news
and
the
return
parties
and
the
ship
and
those
in
her
we
were
sorry
to
hear
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
very
near
and
that
the
mules
had
arrived
and
i
dont
know
what
we
now
settled
down
for
a
good
night
it
seems
to
me
we
are
in
a
new
world
a
weight
is
off
my
mind
and
i
can
once
more
see
a
bright
spot
in
the
sky
for
us
all
the
gloom
is
now
removed
the
bliz
is
bad
outside
and
doctor
and
dimitri
is
gone
and
turned
in
so
will
i
once
more
but
sleep
is
out
of
the
question
february
the
day
have
been
very
bad
and
we
are
obliged
to
remain
until
it
clears
we
are
going
to
move
off
as
soon
as
it
clears
the
day
have
been
very
cold
so
we
have
had
to
remain
in
our
bags
but
things
are
alright
and
we
have
got
plenty
to
eat
now
we
have
all
retired
for
the
night
as
the
bliz
is
still
raging
outside
february
the
wind
went
down
about
so
we
began
to
move
and
were
ready
to
kick
off
at
and
proposed
to
do
the
journey
in
two
stages
it
was
fearful
heavy
going
for
the
poor
dogs
we
arranged
so
that
evans
was
on
dimitri
sledge
and
doctor
and
myself
was
on
the
other
we
have
done
about
half
the
journey
and
are
now
camped
for
a
rest
for
the
dogs
and
ourselves
we
had
a
stiff
miles
the
doctor
and
myself
we
took
turns
in
riding
on
the
sledge
and
walking
and
running
to
keep
up
to
the
dogs
sometimes
we
sank
in
up
to
the
knees
but
we
struggled
through
it
my
legs
is
the
most
powerful
part
of
me
now
but
i
am
tired
and
shall
be
glad
when
it
is
over
i
must
lie
down
now
as
we
are
starting
again
soon
for
hut
point
but
the
surface
is
getting
better
as
we
have
passed
white
island
and
can
see
so
plainly
the
land
castle
rock
and
good
old
erebus
look
so
stately
with
the
smoke
rolling
out
it
is
so
clear
and
calm
and
peaceful
what
a
change
in
our
surroundings
of
a
few
days
ago
and
also
our
prospects
doctor
and
dimitri
have
done
everything
they
could
for
us
february
we
started
off
after
a
rest
for
the
dogs
and
reached
here
at
hut
point
at
where
we
can
rest
in
peace
for
a
time
dimitri
and
crean
are
going
to
cape
evans
the
ship
is
nowhere
in
sight
have
had
to
get
some
seal
meat
and
ice
and
prepare
a
meal
evans
is
alright
and
asleep
we
are
looking
for
a
mail
now
how
funny
we
should
always
be
looking
for
something
else
now
we
are
safe
end
of
lashly
diary
crean
has
told
me
the
story
of
his
walk
as
follows
he
started
at
on
sunday
morning
and
the
surface
was
good
very
good
surface
indeed
and
he
went
about
sixteen
miles
before
he
stopped
good
clear
weather
he
had
three
biscuits
and
two
sticks
of
chocolate
he
stopped
about
five
minutes
sitting
on
the
snow
and
ate
two
biscuits
and
the
chocolate
and
put
one
biscuit
back
in
his
pocket
he
was
quite
warm
and
not
sleepy
he
carried
on
just
the
same
and
passed
safety
camp
on
his
right
some
five
hours
later
and
thinks
it
was
about
on
monday
morning
that
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
barrier
tired
getting
cold
in
the
back
and
the
weather
coming
on
thick
it
was
bright
behind
him
but
it
was
coming
over
the
bluff
and
white
island
was
obscured
though
he
could
still
see
cape
armitage
and
castle
rock
he
slipped
a
lot
on
the
having
several
falls
on
to
his
back
and
it
was
getting
thicker
all
the
time
at
the
barrier
edge
there
was
a
light
wind
now
it
was
blowing
a
strong
wind
drifting
and
snowing
he
made
for
the
gap
and
could
not
get
up
at
first
to
avoid
taking
a
lot
out
of
himself
he
started
to
go
round
cape
armitage
but
soon
felt
slush
coming
through
his
finnesko
he
had
no
crampons
and
made
back
for
the
gap
he
climbed
up
to
the
left
of
the
gap
and
climbed
along
the
side
of
observation
hill
to
avoid
the
slippery
ice
when
he
got
to
the
top
it
was
still
clear
enough
to
see
vaguely
the
outline
of
hut
point
but
he
could
see
no
sledges
nor
dogs
he
sat
down
under
the
lee
of
observation
hill
and
finished
his
biscuit
with
a
bit
of
ice
i
was
very
dry
slid
down
the
side
of
observation
hill
and
thought
at
this
time
there
was
open
water
below
for
he
had
no
goggles
on
the
march
and
his
eyes
were
strained
but
on
getting
near
the
he
found
it
was
polished
and
made
his
way
round
to
the
hut
under
the
when
he
got
close
he
saw
the
dogs
and
sledges
on
the
and
it
was
now
blowing
very
hard
with
drift
he
walked
in
and
found
the
doctor
and
dimitri
inside
he
gave
me
a
tot
first
and
then
a
feed
of
porridge
but
i
could
keep
it
down
thats
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
ever
it
happened
and
it
was
the
brandy
that
did

walt

let
us
come

to
cape
evans
after
the
return
of
the
first
supporting
party
hitherto
our
ways
had
always
been
happy
for
the
most
part
they
had
been
pleasant
scott
was
going
to
reach
the
pole
probably
without
great
difficulty
for
when
we
left
him
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
he
had
only
to
average
seven
miles
a
day
to
go
there
on
full
rations
we
ourselves
had
averaged
geographical
miles
a
day
on
our
way
home
to
one
ton
depôt
and
there
seemed
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
other
two
parties
would
not
do
likewise
and
the
food
was
not
only
sufficient
but
abundant
if
such
marches
were
made
thus
we
were
content
as
we
wandered
over
the
cape
or
sat
upon
some
rock
warmed
by
the
sun
and
watched
the
penguins
bathing
in
the
lake
which
had
formed
in
the
between
us
and
inaccessible
island
all
round
us
were
the
cries
of
the
skua
gulls
as
they
squabbled
among
themselves
and
we
heard
the
swish
of
their
wings
as
they
swooped
down
upon
a
man
who
wandered
too
near
their
nests
out
upon
the
which
was
soggy
and
dangerous
lay
several
seal
and
the
bubblings
and
whistlings
and
gurglings
which
came
from
their
throats
chimed
musically
in
contrast
to
the
hoarse
aak
aak
of
the
adélie
penguins
the
tide
crack
was
sighing
and
groaning
all
the
time
it
was
very
restful
after
the
barrier
silence
meanwhile
the
terra
nova
had
been
seen
in
the
distance
but
the
state
of
the
prevented
her
approach
it
was
not
until
february
that
communication
was
opened
with
her
and
we
got
our
welcome
mails
and
news
of
the
world
during
the
last
year
we
heard
that
campbell
party
had
been
picked
up
at
cape
adare
and
landed
at
evans
coves
we
started
unloading
on
february
and
this
work
was
continued
until
february
there
was
about
three
miles
of
ice
between
the
ship
and
the
shore
and
we
were
doing
more
than
twenty
miles
a
day
in
the
case
of
men
who
had
been
sledging
much
and
who
might
be
wanted
to
sledge
again
this
was
a
mistake
latterly
the
ice
began
to
break
up
and
the
ship
left
on
the
to
pick
up
the
geological
party
on
the
western
side
of
mcmurdo
sound
but
she
met
great
obstacles
and
her
record
near
the
coasts
this
year
is
one
of
continual
fights
against
while
the
winds
experienced
as
the
season
advanced
were
very
strong
on
january
the
fast
ice
at
the
mouth
of
mcmurdo
sound
extended
as
far
as
the
southern
end
of
the
bird
peninsula
ten
days
later
they
found
fast
ice
extending
for
thirty
miles
from
the
head
of
granite
harbour
later
in
the
season
the
most
determined
efforts
were
made
again
and
again
to
penetrate
into
evans
coves
in
order
to
pick
up
campbell
and
his
men
until
the
ice
was
freezing
all
round
them
and
many
times
the
propeller
was
brought
up
dead
against
blocks
of
ice
the
expedition
was
originally
formed
for
two
years
from
the
date
of
leaving
england
but
before
the
ship
left
after
landing
us
at
cape
evans
in
january
the
possibility
of
a
third
year
was
considered
and
certain
requests
for
additional
transport
and
orders
for
stores
were
sent
home
thus
it
came
about
that
the
ship
now
landed
not
only
new
sledges
and
sledging
stores
but
also
fourteen
dogs
from
kamchatka
and
seven
mules
with
their
food
and
equipment
the
dogs
were
big
and
fat
but
the
only
ones
which
proved
of
much
service
for
sledging
were
snowy
a
nice
white
dog
and
bullett
it
was
oates
idea
that
mules
might
prove
a
better
form
of
transport
on
the
barrier
than
ponies
scott
therefore
wrote
to
sir
douglas
haig
then
in
india
that
if
he
failed
to
reach
the
pole
in
the
summer
of
it
is
my
intention
to
make
a
second
attempt
in
the
following
season
provided
fresh
transport
can
be
brought
down
the
circumstances
making
it
necessary
to
plan
to
sacrifice
the
transport
animals
used
in
any
attempt
before
directing
more
ponies
to
be
sent
down
i
have
thoroughly
discussed
the
situation
with
captain
oates
and
he
has
suggested
that
mules
would
be
better
than
ponies
for
our
work
and
that
trained
indian
transport
mules
would
be
ideal
it
is
evident
already
that
our
ponies
have
not
a
uniform
walking
pace
and
that
in
other
small
ways
they
will
be
troublesome
to
us
although
they
are
handy
little
beasts
the
indian
government
not
only
sent
seven
mules
but
when
they
arrived
we
found
that
they
had
been
most
carefully
trained
and
equipped
in
india
they
were
in
the
charge
of
lieutenant
george
pulleyn
and
the
care
and
thought
which
had
been
spent
upon
them
could
not
have
been
exceeded
the
equipment
was
also
extremely
good
and
well
adapted
to
the
conditions
while
most
of
the
improvements
made
by
us
as
the
result
of
a
experience
were
already
foreseen
and
provided
the
mules
themselves
by
name
lal
khan
gulab
begum
ranee
abdullah
pyaree
and
khan
sahib
were
beautiful
animals
atkinson
would
soon
have
to
start
on
his
travels
again
before
we
left
scott
at
the
top
of
the
beardmore
he
gave
him
orders
to
take
the
two
south
in
the
event
of
meares
having
to
return
home
as
seemed
likely
this
was
not
meant
in
any
way
to
be
a
relief
journey
scott
said
that
he
was
not
relying
upon
the
dogs
and
that
in
view
of
the
sledging
in
the
following
year
the
dogs
were
not
to
be
risked
although
it
was
settled
that
some
members
of
the
expedition
would
stay
while
others
returned
to
new
zealand
scott
and
several
of
his
companions
had
left
undecided
until
the
last
moment
the
question
of
whether
they
would
themselves
remain
in
the
south
for
another
year
in
the
event
of
scott
deciding
to
return
home
the
might
make
the
difference
between
catching
or
missing
the
ship
i
had
discussed
this
question
with
wilson
more
than
once
and
he
was
of
opinion
that
the
business
affairs
of
the
expedition
demanded
scott
return
if
possible
wilson
himself
inclined
to
the
view
that
he
himself
would
stay
if
scott
stayed
and
return
if
scott
returned
i
think
that
oates
meant
to
return
and
am
sure
that
bowers
meant
to
stay
indeed
he
welcomed
the
idea
of
one
more
year
in
a
way
which
i
do
not
think
was
equalled
by
any
other
member
of
the
expedition
for
the
most
part
we
felt
that
we
had
joined
up
for
two
years
but
that
if
there
was
to
be
a
third
year
we
would
rather
see
the
thing
through
than
return
home
i
hope
i
have
made
clear
that
the
primary
object
of
this
journey
with
the
was
to
hurry
scott
and
his
companions
home
so
that
they
might
be
in
time
to
catch
the
ship
if
possible
before
she
was
compelled
by
the
close
of
the
season
to
leave
mcmurdo
sound
another
thing
which
made
scott
anxious
to
communicate
with
the
ship
if
possible
before
the
season
forced
her
to
leave
the
sound
was
his
desire
to
send
back
news
from
many
remarks
which
he
made
and
also
from
the
discussions
in
the
hut
during
the
winter
it
was
obvious
that
he
considered
it
was
of
the
first
importance
that
the
news
of
reaching
the
pole
if
it
should
be
reached
be
communicated
to
the
world
without
the
delay
of
another
year
of
course
he
would
also
wish
to
send
news
of
the
safe
return
of
his
party
to
wives
and
relations
as
soon
as
possible
it
is
necessary
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
were
intended
to
hasten
the
return
of
the
polar
party
but
that
they
were
never
meant
to
form
a
relief
journey
but
now
atkinson
was
left
in
a
rather
difficult
position
i
note
in
my
diary
after
we
had
reached
the
hut
that
scott
was
to
have
sent
back
instructions
for
the
dog
party
with
us
but
these
have
it
would
seem
been
forgotten
but
it
may
be
that
scott
considered
that
he
had
given
these
instructions
in
a
conversation
he
had
with
atkinson
at
the
top
of
the
beardmore
glacier
when
scott
said
with
the
depôt
of
which
has
been
laid
come
as
far
as
you
can
according
to
the
plans
for
the
polar
journey
the
food
necessary
to
bring
the
three
advance
parties
of
back
from
one
ton
depôt
to
hut
point
was
to
be
taken
out
to
one
ton
during
the
absence
of
these
parties
this
food
consisted
of
five
weekly
units
of
what
were
known
as
xs
rations
it
was
also
arranged
that
if
possible
a
depôt
of
should
be
taken
out
at
the
same
time
this
was
the
depôt
referred
to
above
by
scott
in
the
event
of
the
return
of
the
in
the
first
half
of
december
which
was
the
original
plan
the
five
units
of
food
and
the
would
have
been
run
out
by
them
to
one
ton
if
the
did
not
return
in
time
to
do
this
a
party
from
cape
evans
was
to
take
out
three
of
the
five
units
of
food
it
has
been
shown
that
the
were
taken
farther
on
the
polar
journey
than
was
originally
intended
indeed
they
were
taken
from
where
they
were
to
have
turned
back
as
far
as
nor
were
they
able
to
make
the
return
journey
in
the
fast
time
which
had
been
expected
of
them
and
the
were
running
very
short
of
food
and
were
compelled
to
encroach
to
some
extent
upon
the
supplies
left
to
provide
for
the
wants
of
those
who
were
following
in
their
tracks
the
did
not
arrive
back
at
cape
evans
until
january
meanwhile
a
party
from
cape
evans
consisting
of
day
nelson
clissold
and
hooper
had
already
according
to
plan
taken
out
three
of
the
five
xs
rations
for
the
returning
parties
the
weights
of
the
party
did
not
allow
for
the
transport
of
the
remaining
two
xs
rations
nor
for
any
of
the
thus
it
was
that
when
atkinson
came
to
make
his
plans
to
go
south
with
the
dogs
he
found
that
there
was
no
south
of
corner
camp
and
that
the
rations
for
the
return
of
the
polar
party
from
one
ton
depôt
had
still
to
be
taken
out
that
is
to
say
the
depôt
of
spoken
of
by
scott
did
not
exist
there
was
however
enough
food
already
at
one
ton
to
allow
the
polar
party
to
come
in
on
reduced
rations
this
meant
that
what
the
could
do
was
limited
and
was
much
less
than
it
might
have
been
had
it
been
possible
to
take
out
the
depôt
of
to
one
ton
also
the
for
the
polar
party
had
to
be
added
to
the
weights
taken
by
the
dogs
to
estimate
even
approximately
at
what
date
a
party
will
reach
a
given
point
after
a
journey
of
this
length
when
the
weather
conditions
are
always
uncertain
and
the
number
of
travelling
days
unknown
was
a
most
difficult
task
the
only
guide
was
the
average
marches
per
diem
made
by
our
own
return
party
and
the
average
of
the
second
return
party
if
it
should
return
before
the
dog
party
set
out
a
week
one
way
or
the
other
was
certainly
not
a
large
margin
a
couple
of
blizzards
might
make
this
much
difference
in
the
plan
of
the
southern
journey
scott
working
on
averages
mentions
march
as
a
possible
date
of
return
to
hut
point
allowing
seven
days
in
from
one
ton
whilst
on
the
outward
journey
i
heard
scott
discuss
the
possibility
of
returning
in
april
and
the
polar
party
had
enough
food
to
allow
them
to
do
this
on
full
rations
atkinson
and
dimitri
with
the
two
left
cape
evans
for
hut
point
on
february
because
the
which
was
our
only
means
of
communication
between
these
places
and
so
to
the
barrier
was
beginning
to
break
up
atkinson
intended
to
leave
hut
point
for
the
barrier
in
about
a
week
time
at
on
february
crean
arrived
with
the
astounding
news
that
lieutenant
evans
still
alive
but
at
his
last
gasp
was
lying
out
near
corner
camp
and
that
lashly
was
nursing
him
that
the
last
supporting
party
had
consisted
of
three
men
only
a
possibility
which
had
never
been
considered
and
that
they
had
left
scott
travelling
rapidly
and
making
good
averages
only
geographical
miles
from
the
pole
scott
was
so
well
advanced
that
it
seemed
that
he
would
be
home
much
earlier
than
had
been
anticipated
a
blizzard
which
had
been
threatening
on
the
barrier
and
actually
blowing
at
hut
point
during
crean
solitary
journey
but
which
had
lulled
as
he
arrived
now
broke
with
full
force
and
nothing
could
be
done
for
evans
until
it
took
off
sufficiently
for
the
to
travel
but
in
the
meantime
crean
urgently
wanted
food
and
rest
and
warmth
as
these
were
supplied
to
him
atkinson
learned
bit
by
bit
the
story
of
the
saving
of
evans
life
told
so
graphically
in
lashly
diary
which
is
given
in
the
preceding
chapter
and
pieced
together
the
details
of
crean
solitary
walk
of
statute
miles
this
effort
was
made
it
should
be
remembered
at
the
end
of
a
journey
of
three
and
a
half
months
and
over
ground
rendered
especially
perilous
by
crevasses
from
which
a
man
travelling
alone
had
no
chance
of
rescue
in
case
of
accident
crean
was
walking
for
eighteen
hours
and
it
was
lucky
for
him
as
also
for
his
companions
that
the
blizzard
which
broke
half
an
hour
after
his
arrival
did
not
come
a
little
sooner
for
no
power
on
earth
could
have
saved
him
then
and
the
news
of
evans
plight
would
not
have
been
brought
the
blizzard
raged
all
that
day
and
the
next
night
and
morning
and
nothing
could
be
done
but
during
the
afternoon
of
the
the
conditions
improved
and
at
atkinson
and
dimitri
started
with
the
two
though
it
was
still
blowing
hard
and
very
thick
they
travelled
with
one
rest
for
the
dogs
until
the
next
day
but
had
a
very
hazy
idea
where
they
were
most
of
the
time
owing
to
the
vile
weather
once
at
any
rate
they
seem
to
have
got
right
in
under
white
island
when
they
camped
the
second
time
they
thought
they
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lashly
tent
and
in
a
temporary
clearance
they
saw
the
flag
which
lashly
had
put
up
on
the
sledge
evans
was
still
alive
and
atkinson
was
able
to
give
him
immediately
the
fresh
vegetables
fruit
and
seal
meat
which
his
body
wanted
atkinson
has
never
been
able
to
express
adequately
the
admiration
he
feels
for
lashly
care
and
nursing
all
that
night
and
the
next
day
the
blizzard
continued
and
made
a
start
impossible
and
it
was
not
until
on
the
morning
of
the
that
they
could
start
for
hut
point
evans
being
carried
in
his
on
the
sledge
lashly
has
told
how
they
got
home
at
cape
evans
we
knew
nothing
of
these
events
which
had
made
reorganization
inevitable
it
was
clear
that
atkinson
being
the
only
doctor
available
would
have
to
stay
with
evans
who
was
very
seriously
ill
indeed
atkinson
told
me
that
another
day
or
at
the
most
two
would
have
finished
him
in
fact
he
says
that
when
he
first
saw
him
he
thought
he
must
die
it
was
a
considerable
surprise
then
when
dimitri
with
crean
and
one
reached
cape
evans
about
on
february
with
a
note
from
atkinson
who
said
that
he
thought
he
had
better
stay
with
lieutenant
evans
and
that
some
one
else
should
take
out
the
dogs
he
suggested
that
wright
or
myself
should
take
them
this
was
our
first
intimation
that
the
dogs
had
not
already
gone
south
wright
and
i
started
for
hut
point
by
the
same
day
and
on
our
arrival
it
was
decided
by
atkinson
that
i
was
to
take
out
the
dogs
owing
to
the
early
departure
of
our
meteorologist
simpson
wright
who
had
special
qualifications
for
this
important
work
was
to
remain
at
cape
evans
dimitri
having
rested
his
overnight
at
cape
evans
arrived
at
hut
point
on
the
morning
of
the
now
the
daily
distance
which
every
party
had
to
average
from
hut
point
to
its
and
back
to
hut
point
so
as
to
be
on
full
rations
all
the
way
was
only
geographical
miles
from
hut
point
to
the
latitude
in
which
he
was
last
seen
scott
had
averaged
more
than
ten
geographical
miles
a
day
taking
into
consideration
the
advanced
latitude
at
which
the
second
return
party
had
left
scott
and
the
extremely
good
daily
averages
these
two
parties
had
marched
on
the
plateau
up
to
this
point
namely
geographical
miles
a
day
seeing
also
that
the
first
return
party
had
averaged
geographical
miles
on
their
return
from
to
one
ton
depôt
and
the
second
return
party
had
averaged
geographical
miles
on
their
return
from
to
the
same
place
although
one
of
the
three
men
was
seriously
ill
it
was
supposed
that
all
the
previous
estimates
made
for
the
return
of
the
polar
party
were
too
late
and
that
the
opportunity
to
reach
one
ton
camp
before
them
had
been
lost
meanwhile
the
full
rations
for
their
return
over
the
miles
statute
from
one
ton
to
hut
point
were
still
at
hut
point
my
orders
were
given
me
by
atkinson
and
were
verbal
as
follows
to
take
days
food
for
the
two
men
and
days
food
for
the
two
together
with
the
food
for
the
polar
party
to
travel
to
one
ton
depôt
as
fast
as
possible
and
leave
the
food
there
if
scott
had
not
arrived
at
one
ton
depôt
before
me
i
was
to
judge
what
to
do
that
scott
was
not
in
any
way
dependent
on
the
dogs
for
his
return
that
scott
had
given
particular
instructions
that
the
dogs
were
not
to
be
risked
in
view
of
the
sledging
plans
for
next
season
since
it
had
proved
impossible
to
take
the
depôt
of
together
with
the
full
polar
party
rations
to
one
ton
before
this
considering
the
unforeseen
circumstances
which
had
arisen
and
seeing
that
this
journey
of
the
was
not
indispensable
being
simply
meant
to
bring
the
last
party
home
more
speedily
i
do
not
believe
that
better
instructions
could
have
been
given
than
these
of
atkinson
i
was
eager
to
start
as
soon
as
the
team
which
had
come
back
from
cape
evans
was
rested
but
a
blizzard
prevented
this
on
the
morning
of
the
it
was
thick
as
a
hedge
but
it
cleared
enough
to
pack
sledges
in
the
afternoon
and
when
we
turned
into
our
bags
we
could
see
observation
hill
we
started
at
that
night
i
confess
i
had
my
misgivings
i
had
never
driven
one
dog
let
alone
a
team
of
them
i
knew
nothing
of
navigation
and
one
ton
was
a
hundred
and
thirty
miles
away
out
in
the
middle
of
the
barrier
and
away
from
landmarks
and
so
as
we
pushed
our
way
out
through
the
wind
and
drift
that
night
i
felt
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
hoped
for
rather
than
to
be
expected
but
we
got
along
very
well
dimitri
driving
his
team
in
front
as
he
did
most
of
this
journey
and
picking
up
marks
very
helpfully
with
his
sharp
eyes
in
the
low
temperatures
we
met
the
glasses
which
i
must
wear
are
almost
impossible
because
of
fogging
we
took
three
boxes
of
from
safety
camp
and
another
three
boxes
from
a
point
sixteen
miles
from
hut
point
here
we
rested
the
dogs
for
a
few
hours
and
started
again
at
all
day
the
light
was
appalling
and
the
wind
strong
but
to
my
great
relief
we
found
corner
camp
after
four
hours
more
travelling
the
flag
showing
plainly
though
the
cairn
itself
was
invisible
when
a
hundred
yards
away
this
was
the
last
place
where
there
was
any
on
the
route
and
the
dogs
got
a
good
feed
after
doing
miles
statute
for
the
day
run
this
was
more
than
we
had
hoped
the
only
disquieting
fact
was
that
both
the
which
we
had
were
working
wrong
the
better
of
the
two
seemed
however
to
be
marking
the
total
mileage
fairly
correctly
at
present
though
the
hands
which
indicated
more
detailed
information
were
quite
at
sea
we
had
no
minimum
thermometer
but
the
present
temperature
was
mount
terror
has
proved
our
friend
for
the
slope
just
above
the
knoll
has
remained
clear
when
everything
else
was
covered
and
we
have
steered
by
that
behind
us
it
seemed
when
we
started
in
low
drift
that
we
should
pick
up
nothing
but
by
good
luck
or
good
i
know
what
we
have
got
everything
first
the
motor
then
pony
walls
at
miles
where
we
stopped
and
had
a
cup
of
tea
i
wanted
to
do
miles
but
we
have
done
miles
on
the
best
running
surface
i
have
ever
seen
after
lunch
we
got
a
cairn
which
we
could
not
see
twenty
yards
away
after
we
had
reached
it
but
which
we
could
see
for
a
long
way
on
the
southern
horizon
against
a
thin
strip
of
blue
sky
we
camped
just
in
time
to
get
the
tent
pitched
before
a
line
of
drift
we
saw
coming
out
of
the
sky
hit
us
it
is
now
blowing
a
mild
blizzard
and
drifting
miles
in
two
days
is
more
than
i
expected
may
our
luck
continue
dogs
pulling
very
fit
and
not
done
up
i
had
my
first
upset
just
after
starting
the
sledge
capsizing
on
a
great
sastrugus
like
the
ramp
dimitri
was
a
long
way
ahead
and
all
behind
was
very
thick
i
had
to
unload
the
sledge
for
i
could
not
right
it
alone
just
as
i
righted
it
the
team
took
charge
i
missed
the
but
got
on
to
the
sledge
with
no
hope
of
stopping
them
and
i
was
carried
a
mile
to
the
south
leaving
four
boxes
of
the
weekly
bag
cooker
and
tent
poles
on
the
ground
the
team
stopped
when
they
reached
dimitri
team
and
by
then
the
gear
was
out
of
sight
we
went
back
for
it
and
made
good
miles
for
the
day
on
a
splendid
surface
the
sun
went
down
at
miraged
quite
flat
on
top
after
he
had
gone
down
a
great
bonfire
seemed
to
blaze
out
from
the
horizon
now
and
we
use
a
candle
for
the
first
time
bluff
if
anybody
had
told
me
we
could
reach
bluff
depôt
nearly
ninety
miles
in
four
days
i
would
not
have
believed
it
we
have
had
a
good
clear
day
with
much
mirage
dogs
a
bit
tired
the
next
three
days
run
took
us
to
one
ton
on
the
day
we
left
bluff
depôt
which
had
been
made
a
little
more
than
a
year
ago
when
certain
of
the
ponies
were
sent
home
on
the
depôt
journey
but
which
no
longer
contained
any
provisions
we
travelled
miles
there
was
a
good
light
and
it
was
as
warm
as
could
be
expected
in
march
the
next
day
march
we
did
miles
after
a
cold
and
sleepless
night
and
a
mild
blizzard
from
and
quite
thick
on
the
night
of
march
we
reached
one
ton
heading
into
a
strongish
wind
with
a
temperature
of
these
were
the
first
two
days
on
which
we
had
cold
weather
but
it
was
nothing
to
worry
about
for
us
and
was
certainly
not
colder
than
one
could
ordinarily
have
expected
at
this
time
of
year
arrived
at
one
ton
my
first
feeling
was
one
of
relief
that
the
polar
party
had
not
been
to
the
depôt
and
that
therefore
we
had
got
their
provisions
out
in
time
the
question
of
what
we
were
to
do
in
the
immediate
future
was
settled
for
us
for
four
days
out
of
the
six
during
which
we
were
at
one
ton
the
weather
made
travelling
southwards
that
is
against
the
wind
either
entirely
impossible
or
such
that
the
chance
of
seeing
another
party
at
any
distance
was
nil
on
the
two
remaining
days
i
could
have
run
a
day
farther
south
and
back
again
with
the
possibility
of
missing
the
party
on
the
way
i
decided
to
remain
at
the
depôt
where
we
were
certain
to
meet
on
the
day
after
we
arrived
at
one
ton
march
dimitri
came
to
me
and
said
that
the
dogs
ought
to
be
given
more
food
since
they
were
getting
done
and
were
losing
their
coats
they
had
of
course
done
a
great
deal
of
sledging
already
this
year
dimitri
had
long
experience
of
and
i
had
none
i
thought
and
i
still
think
he
was
right
i
increased
the
dog
ration
therefore
and
this
left
us
with
thirteen
more
days
including
that
for
march
the
weather
was
bad
when
we
were
at
one
ton
for
when
it
was
blowing
the
temperature
often
remained
comparatively
low
and
when
it
was
not
blowing
it
dropped
considerably
and
i
find
readings
in
my
diary
of
and
at
having
no
minimum
thermometer
we
did
not
know
the
night
temperatures
on
the
other
hand
i
find
an
entry
is
the
first
real
good
one
we
have
had
only
about
and
the
sun
shining
and
we
have
shifted
the
tent
dried
our
bags
and
gear
a
lot
and
been
pottering
about
all
day
at
this
time
however
when
we
were
at
one
ton
i
looked
upon
these
conditions
as
being
a
temporary
cold
snap
there
was
no
reason
then
to
suppose
these
were
normal
march
conditions
in
the
middle
of
the
barrier
where
no
one
had
ever
been
at
this
time
of
year
i
believe
now
they
are
normal
on
the
other
hand
in
our
meteorological
report
simpson
argues
that
they
were
abnormal
for
the
barrier
at
this
time
of
year
since
there
was
no
depôt
of
at
one
ton
it
was
not
possible
to
go
farther
south
except
for
the
one
day
mentioned
above
without
killing
dogs
my
orders
on
this
point
were
perfectly
explicit
i
saw
no
reason
for
disobeying
them
and
indeed
it
appeared
that
we
had
been
wrong
to
hurry
out
so
soon
before
the
time
that
scott
had
reckoned
that
he
would
return
and
that
the
polar
party
would
really
come
in
at
the
time
scott
had
calculated
before
starting
rather
than
at
the
time
we
had
reckoned
from
the
data
brought
back
by
the
last
return
party
from
the
particulars
already
given
it
will
be
seen
that
i
had
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
polar
party
could
be
in
want
of
food
the
polar
party
of
five
men
had
according
to
our
rations
plenty
of
food
either
on
their
sledge
or
in
the
depôts
in
addition
they
had
a
lot
of
pony
meat
depôted
at
middle
glacier
depôt
and
onwards
from
there
though
we
did
not
know
it
the
death
of
evans
at
the
foot
of
the
beardmore
glacier
provided
an
additional
amount
of
food
for
the
four
men
who
were
then
left
the
full
amount
of
oil
for
this
food
had
been
left
in
the
depôts
but
we
know
now
what
we
did
not
know
then
that
some
of
it
had
evaporated
these
matters
are
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
the
account
of
the
return
of
the
polar
party
and
after
thus
i
felt
little
anxiety
for
the
polar
party
but
i
was
getting
anxious
about
my
companion
soon
after
arrival
at
one
ton
it
was
clear
that
dimitri
was
feeling
the
cold
he
complained
of
his
head
then
his
right
arm
and
side
were
affected
and
from
this
time
onwards
he
found
that
he
could
do
less
and
less
with
his
right
side
still
i
did
not
worry
much
about
it
and
my
decision
as
to
our
movements
was
not
affected
by
this
complication
i
decided
to
allow
eight
days
food
for
our
return
which
meant
that
we
must
start
on
march
pretty
cold
night
when
we
turned
out
at
getting
our
gear
together
and
the
dogs
more
or
less
into
order
after
their
six
days
was
cold
work
and
we
started
in
minus
thirties
and
a
head
wind
the
dogs
were
mad
stark
staring
lunatics
dimitri
team
wrecked
my
and
i
left
it
lying
on
the
ground
a
mile
from
one
ton
all
we
could
do
was
to
hang
on
to
the
sledge
and
let
them
go
there
was
a
chance
to
go
back
turn
them
or
steer
them
dimitri
broke
his
my
team
fought
as
they
went
once
i
was
dragged
with
my
foot
pinned
under
my
which
was
itself
jammed
in
the
grummet
several
times
i
only
managed
to
catch
on
anywhere
this
went
on
for
six
or
seven
miles
and
then
they
got
better
our
remaining
was
quite
unreliable
but
following
our
outward
tracks
for
it
became
thick
and
overcast
and
judging
by
our
old
camping
sites
we
reckoned
that
we
had
done
an
excellent
run
of
to
miles
statute
for
the
day
the
temperature
when
we
camped
was
only
however
it
became
much
colder
in
the
night
and
when
we
turned
out
it
was
so
thick
that
i
decided
we
must
wait
at
on
march
there
was
one
small
patch
of
blue
sky
showing
and
we
started
to
steer
by
this
soon
it
was
blowing
a
mild
blizzard
and
we
stopped
after
doing
what
i
reckoned
was
eight
miles
steering
by
trying
to
keep
the
wind
on
my
ear
but
i
think
we
were
turning
circles
much
of
the
time
it
blew
hard
and
was
very
cold
during
the
night
and
we
turned
out
on
the
morning
of
march
to
a
blizzard
with
a
temperature
of
this
gradually
took
off
and
at
dimitri
said
he
could
see
the
bluff
and
we
were
right
into
the
land
and
therefore
the
pressure
this
was
startling
but
later
it
cleared
enough
to
reassure
me
though
dimitri
was
so
certain
that
during
the
first
part
of
our
run
that
day
i
steered
east
a
lot
we
did
to
miles
this
day
in
drift
and
a
temperature
of
by
now
i
was
becoming
really
alarmed
and
anxious
about
dimitri
who
seemed
to
be
getting
much
worse
and
to
be
able
to
do
less
and
less
sitting
on
a
sledge
the
next
day
with
a
head
wind
and
the
temperature
was
cold
the
land
was
clear
when
we
turned
out
and
i
could
see
that
we
must
be
far
outside
our
course
but
almost
immediately
it
became
foggy
we
made
in
towards
the
land
a
good
deal
and
made
a
good
run
but
owing
to
the
being
useless
and
the
bad
weather
generally
during
the
last
few
days
i
had
a
very
hazy
idea
indeed
where
we
were
when
we
camped
having
been
steering
for
some
time
by
the
faint
gleam
of
the
sun
through
the
mist
just
after
camping
dimitri
suddenly
pointed
to
a
black
spot
which
seemed
to
wave
to
and
fro
we
decided
that
it
was
the
flag
of
the
derelict
motor
near
corner
camp
which
up
to
that
time
i
thought
was
ten
to
fifteen
miles
away
this
was
a
great
relief
and
we
debated
packing
up
again
and
going
to
it
but
decided
to
stay
where
we
were
it
was
fairly
clear
on
the
morning
of
march
which
was
lucky
for
it
was
now
obvious
that
we
were
miles
from
corner
camp
and
much
too
near
the
land
the
flag
we
had
seen
must
have
been
a
miraged
piece
of
pressure
and
it
was
providential
that
we
had
not
made
for
it
and
found
worse
trouble
than
we
actually
experienced
try
all
i
could
that
morning
my
team
which
was
leading
insisted
on
edging
westwards
at
last
i
saw
what
i
thought
was
a
cairn
but
found
out
just
in
time
that
it
was
a
haycock
or
mound
of
ice
formed
by
pressure
by
its
side
was
a
large
open
crevasse
of
which
about
fifty
yards
of
had
fallen
in
for
several
miles
we
knew
that
we
were
crossing
big
crevasses
by
the
hollow
sound
and
it
was
with
considerable
relief
that
i
sighted
the
motor
and
then
corner
camp
some
two
or
three
miles
to
the
east
of
us
dimitri
had
left
his
alpine
rope
there
and
also
i
should
have
liked
to
have
brought
in
evans
sledge
but
it
would
have
meant
about
five
miles
extra
and
i
left
it
i
hope
scott
finding
no
note
will
not
think
we
are
lost
dimitri
seemed
to
be
getting
worse
and
we
pushed
on
until
we
camped
that
night
only
fifteen
miles
from
hut
point
my
main
anxiety
was
whether
the
between
us
and
hut
point
was
in
because
i
felt
that
the
job
of
getting
the
teams
up
on
to
the
peninsula
and
along
it
and
down
the
other
side
would
be
almost
more
than
we
could
do
there
was
an
ominous
sky
ahead
on
march
we
were
held
up
all
day
by
a
strong
blizzard
but
by
the
next
morning
we
could
see
just
the
outline
of
white
island
i
was
very
anxious
for
dimitri
said
that
he
had
nearly
fainted
and
i
felt
that
we
must
get
on
somehow
and
chance
the
being
in
he
stayed
inside
the
tent
as
long
as
possible
and
my
spirits
rose
as
the
land
began
to
clear
all
round
while
i
was
packing
up
both
sledges
from
safety
camp
the
mirage
at
the
edge
of
the
barrier
was
alarming
but
as
we
approached
the
edge
to
my
very
great
relief
i
found
that
the
was
still
in
and
that
what
we
had
taken
for
frost
smoke
was
only
drift
over
cape
armitage
pushing
into
the
drift
round
the
corner
i
found
atkinson
on
the
and
keohane
in
the
hut
behind
in
a
few
minutes
we
had
the
gist
of
one
another
news
the
ship
had
made
attempt
after
attempt
to
reach
campbell
and
his
five
men
but
they
had
not
been
taken
off
from
evans
coves
when
she
finally
left
mcmurdo
sound
on
march
she
would
make
another
effort
on
her
way
to
new
zealand
evans
was
better
and
was
being
taken
home
meanwhile
there
were
four
of
us
at
hut
point
and
we
could
not
communicate
with
our
companions
at
cape
evans
until
the
sound
froze
over
for
the
open
sea
was
washing
the
feet
of
vince
cross
we
were
not
unduly
alarmed
about
the
polar
party
at
present
but
began
to
make
arrangements
for
further
sledging
if
necessary
it
was
useless
to
think
of
taking
the
dogs
again
for
they
were
thoroughly
done
the
mules
and
the
new
dogs
were
at
cape
evans
in
four
or
five
days
atkinson
wishes
to
start
south
again
to
see
what
we
can
do
if
the
polar
party
is
not
in
i
agree
with
him
that
to
try
and
go
west
to
meet
campbell
is
useless
just
now
if
we
can
go
north
they
can
come
south
and
to
put
two
parties
there
on
the
new
is
to
double
the
risk
a
blizzard
day
but
only
about
force
i
think
they
will
have
been
able
to
travel
all
right
on
the
barrier
atkinson
thinks
of
starting
on
the
my
view
is
that
allowing
three
weeks
and
four
days
for
the
summit
and
ten
days
for
being
hung
up
by
weather
we
can
give
them
five
weeks
after
the
last
return
party
to
march
to
get
in
having
been
quite
safe
and
sound
all
the
way
we
feel
anxious
now
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
need
for
alarm
till
then
and
they
might
get
in
well
after
that
and
be
all
right
now
our
only
real
chance
of
finding
them
if
we
go
out
is
from
here
to
ten
miles
south
of
corner
camp
after
that
we
shall
do
all
we
can
but
it
would
be
no
good
because
there
is
no
very
definite
route
therefore
i
would
start
out
on
march
when
we
would
travel
that
part
with
most
chance
of
meeting
them
there
if
they
have
any
trouble
i
have
put
this
to
atkinson
and
will
willingly
do
what
he
decides
i
am
feeling
pretty
done
up
and
have
rested
the
prospect
of
what
will
be
a
hard
journey
feeling
as
i
do
is
rather
bad
i
do
think
there
is
really
cause
for
alarm
and
we
are
very
anxious
though
the
pole
party
could
not
be
in
yet
also
i
am
very
done
and
more
so
than
i
at
first
thought
i
am
afraid
it
is
a
bit
doubtful
whether
i
can
get
out
again
yet
but
i
feel
better
and
have
been
for
a
short
walk
i
am
taking
all
the
rest
i
can
last
night
a
very
strong
blizzard
blew
wind
force
and
big
snowfall
and
drift
this
morning
the
doors
and
windows
are
all
drifted
up
and
we
could
hardly
get
out
a
lot
of
snow
had
got
inside
the
hut
also
i
was
feeling
rotten
and
thought
that
to
go
out
and
clear
the
window
and
door
would
do
me
good
this
i
did
but
came
back
in
a
big
squall
passing
atkinson
as
i
came
in
then
i
felt
myself
going
faint
and
remember
pushing
the
door
to
get
in
if
possible
i
knew
no
more
until
i
came
to
on
the
floor
just
inside
the
door
having
broken
some
tendons
in
my
right
hand
in
falling
two
days
afterwards
the
dogs
sang
at
they
often
did
this
when
a
party
was
approaching
even
when
it
was
still
far
away
and
they
had
done
so
when
crean
came
in
on
his
walk
from
corner
camp
we
were
cheered
by
the
noise
but
no
party
arrived
and
the
singing
of
the
dogs
was
explained
later
by
some
seal
appearing
on
the
new
ice
in
arrival
bay
atkinson
decided
to
go
out
on
to
the
barrier
with
keohane
on
the
it
was
obvious
that
i
could
not
go
with
them
he
told
me
afterwards
that
when
i
came
in
with
the
he
was
sure
i
could
not
go
out
again
the
wind
came
away
yesterday
evening
first
and
then
but
not
bad
though
very
thick
it
was
a
surprise
to
find
we
could
see
the
western
mountains
this
morning
and
i
believe
it
has
been
a
good
day
on
the
barrier
though
it
is
still
blowing
with
low
drift
this
evening
we
are
now
on
the
days
when
i
expect
the
polar
party
in
pray
god
i
may
be
right
atkinson
and
i
look
at
one
another
and
he
looks
and
i
feel
quite
haggard
with
anxiety
he
says
he
does
not
think
they
have
scurvy
we
both
i
think
feel
quite
comfortable
in
comparison
about
campbell
he
only
wants
to
exercise
care
and
his
great
care
was
almost
a
byword
on
the
ship
they
are
fresh
and
they
have
plenty
of
seal
he
discussed
with
pennell
both
the
possibility
of
shipwreck
and
that
of
the
ship
being
unable
to
get
to
him
and
for
this
reason
landed
an
extra
month
rations
as
a
depôt
also
he
contemplated
the
idea
of
living
on
seal
he
knows
of
the
butter
point
depôt
and
knows
that
a
party
has
been
sledging
in
that
neighbourhood
though
he
does
not
know
of
the
depôts
they
left
at
cape
roberts
and
cape
bernacchi
they
are
right
out
on
the
points
and
taylor
says
he
could
not
miss
them
on
his
way
down
the
coast
this
day
atkinson
thought
he
saw
campbell
party
coming
in
and
the
next
day
keohane
and
dimitri
came
in
great
excitement
and
said
they
could
see
them
and
we
were
out
on
the
point
and
on
the
in
the
drift
for
quite
a
long
time
last
night
we
had
turned
in
about
two
hours
when
five
or
six
knocks
were
hit
on
the
little
window
over
our
heads
atkinson
shouted
and
cried
they
in
keohane
said
cook
some
one
lit
a
candle
and
left
it
in
the
far
corner
of
the
hut
to
give
them
light
and
we
all
rushed
out
but
there
was
no
one
there
it
was
the
nearest
approach
to
ghost
work
that
i
have
ever
heard
and
it
must
have
been
a
dog
which
sleeps
in
that
window
he
must
have
shaken
himself
hitting
the
window
with
his
tail
atkinson
thought
he
heard
footsteps
on
wednesday
march
atkinson
started
out
on
to
the
barrier
with
one
companion
keohane
during
the
whole
of
this
trip
the
temperatures
were
low
and
both
men
obtained
but
little
sleep
finding
of
course
that
a
tent
occupied
by
two
men
only
is
a
very
cold
place
the
first
two
days
they
made
nine
miles
each
day
on
march
they
pushed
on
in
thick
weather
for
eleven
miles
when
the
weather
cleared
enough
to
show
them
that
they
had
got
into
the
white
island
pressure
on
march
they
reached
a
point
south
of
corner
camp
when
taking
into
consideration
the
weather
and
temperatures
and
the
time
of
the
year
and
the
hopelessness
of
finding
the
party
except
at
any
definite
point
like
a
depôt
i
decided
to
return
from
here
we
depôted
the
major
portion
of
a
week
provisions
to
enable
them
to
communicate
with
hut
point
in
case
they
should
reach
this
point
at
this
date
in
my
own
mind
i
was
morally
certain
that
the
party
had
perished
and
in
fact
on
march
captain
scott
miles
south
of
one
ton
depôt
made
the
last
entry
in
his
diary
they
arrived
back
on
april
yesterday
evening
at
atkinson
and
keohane
arrived
it
was
pretty
thick
here
and
blowing
too
but
they
had
had
a
fair
day
on
the
barrier
they
had
been
out
to
corner
camp
and
eight
miles
farther
their
bags
were
bad
their
clothes
very
bad
after
six
days
they
must
have
had
minus
forties
constantly
it
is
a
moral
certainty
that
to
go
farther
south
would
serve
no
purpose
and
for
two
men
would
be
a
useless
risk
they
did
quite
right
to
come
back
they
are
much
in
want
of
sleep
poor
devils
and
i
do
hope
atkinson
will
allow
himself
to
rest
he
looks
as
though
he
might
knock
up
keohane
did
well
and
is
very
fit
they
came
in
over
fifteen
miles
yesterday
and
have
brought
in
the
sledge
of
the
second
return
party
the
one
they
took
out
being
very
heavy
pulling
they
had
no
day
on
which
they
could
not
travel
here
it
has
been
blowing
and
drifting
half
the
time
he
has
been
absent
and
a
few
days
later
we
have
got
to
face
it
now
the
pole
party
will
not
in
all
probability
ever
get
back
and
there
is
no
more
that
we
can
do
the
next
step
must
be
to
get
to
cape
evans
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
there
are
fresh
men
there
at
any
rate
fresh
compared
to
us
atkinson
was
the
senior
officer
left
and
unless
campbell
and
his
party
came
in
the
command
of
the
main
party
devolved
upon
him
it
was
not
a
position
which
any
one
could
envy
even
if
he
had
been
fresh
and
fit
amidst
all
his
anxieties
and
responsibilities
he
looked
after
me
with
the
greatest
patience
and
care
i
was
so
weak
that
sometimes
i
could
only
keep
on
my
legs
with
difficulty
the
glands
of
my
throat
were
swollen
so
that
i
could
hardly
speak
or
swallow
my
heart
was
strained
and
i
had
considerable
pain
at
such
a
time
i
was
only
a
nuisance
but
nothing
could
have
exceeded
his
kindness
and
his
skill
with
the
few
drugs
which
we
possessed
again
and
again
in
these
days
some
one
would
see
one
or
other
of
the
missing
parties
coming
in
it
always
proved
to
be
mirage
a
seal
or
pressure
or
i
do
not
know
what
but
never
could
we
quite
persuade
ourselves
that
these
excitements
might
not
have
something
in
them
and
every
time
hope
sprang
up
anew
meanwhile
the
matter
of
serious
importance
was
the
state
of
the
ice
in
the
bays
between
us
and
cape
evans
we
get
help
all
the
ice
in
the
middle
of
the
sound
was
swept
out
by
the
winds
of
march
to
april
and
on
the
following
day
atkinson
climbed
arrival
heights
to
see
how
the
remaining
ice
looked
the
view
over
the
sound
from
here
is
shown
in
the
frontispiece
to
this
book
the
ice
in
the
two
bays
to
cape
evans
is
quite
new
formed
this
morning
i
suppose
with
the
rest
that
is
in
the
sound
there
are
open
leads
between
glacier
tongue
and
cape
evans
inside
the
line
joining
the
ends
of
the
two
there
is
a
big
berg
in
between
glacier
tongue
and
the
islands
and
also
a
flat
one
off
cape
evans
we
had
some
good
freezing
days
after
this
and
on
april
we
tried
the
ice
this
afternoon
it
is
naturally
slushy
and
salt
but
some
hundred
yards
from
the
old
ice
it
is
six
inches
thick
probably
it
averages
about
this
thickness
all
over
the
sound
then
we
had
a
hard
blizzard
on
the
fourth
day
of
which
it
was
possible
to
get
up
the
heights
again
and
see
for
some
distance
as
far
as
could
be
judged
the
ice
in
the
two
bays
had
remained
firm
these
bays
are
those
formed
on
either
side
of
glacier
tongue
by
the
hut
point
peninsula
on
the
south
and
by
cape
evans
and
the
islands
on
the
north
on
april
atkinson
keohane
and
dimitri
started
for
cape
evans
meaning
to
travel
along
the
peninsula
to
the
hutton
cliffs
and
thence
to
cross
the
in
these
bays
if
it
proved
to
be
practicable
the
amount
of
daylight
was
now
very
restricted
and
the
sun
would
disappear
for
the
winter
a
week
hence
arrived
at
the
hutton
cliffs
where
it
was
blowing
as
usual
they
lost
no
time
in
lowering
themselves
and
their
sledge
on
to
the
and
were
then
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
how
slippery
it
was
we
set
sail
before
a
strong
following
breeze
and
all
sitting
on
the
sledge
had
reached
the
glacier
tongue
in
twenty
minutes
we
clambered
over
the
tongue
and
our
luck
and
the
breeze
still
holding
we
reached
cape
evans
completing
the
last
seven
miles
all
sitting
on
the
sledge
in
an
hour
illustration
cape
evans
from
arrival
heights
illustration
cape
royds
from
cape
barne
there
i
called
together
all
the
members
and
explained
the
situation
telling
them
what
had
been
done
and
what
i
then
proposed
to
do
also
asking
them
for
their
advice
in
this
trying
time
the
opinion
was
almost
unanimous
that
all
that
was
possible
had
been
already
done
owing
to
the
lateness
of
the
year
and
the
likelihood
of
our
being
unable
to
make
our
way
up
the
coast
to
campbell
one
or
two
members
suggested
that
another
journey
might
be
made
to
corner
camp
knowing
the
conditions
which
had
lately
prevailed
on
the
barrier
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
decide
the
uselessness
of
this
all
was
well
at
cape
evans
winds
and
temperatures
had
both
been
high
the
latter
being
in
marked
contrast
to
the
low
temperatures
we
had
experienced
at
hut
point
which
averaged
as
much
as
lower
than
those
that
were
recorded
in
the
previous
year
the
seven
mules
were
well
but
three
of
the
new
dogs
had
died
we
were
always
being
troubled
by
that
mysterious
disease
before
she
left
for
new
zealand
the
following
members
of
our
company
joined
the
ship
simpson
who
had
to
return
to
his
work
in
india
griffith
taylor
who
had
been
lent
to
us
by
the
australian
government
for
only
one
year
ponting
whose
photographic
work
was
done
day
whose
work
with
the
motors
was
done
meares
who
was
recalled
by
family
affairs
forde
whose
hand
had
never
recovered
the
effects
of
during
the
spring
clissold
who
fell
off
a
berg
and
concussed
himself
and
anton
whose
work
with
the
ponies
was
done
lieutenant
evans
was
invalided
home
archer
had
been
landed
to
take
clissold
place
as
cook
another
seaman
williamson
was
landed
to
take
forde
place
and
of
our
sledging
companions
he
was
the
only
fresh
man
wright
was
probably
the
most
fit
after
him
and
otherwise
we
had
no
one
who
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
been
considered
fit
to
go
out
sledging
again
this
season
especially
at
a
time
when
the
sun
was
just
leaving
us
for
the
winter
we
were
sledged
out
the
next
few
days
were
occupied
in
making
preparations
for
a
further
sledge
journey
and
on
april
a
party
started
to
return
to
hut
point
by
the
hutton
cliffs
atkinson
wright
keohane
and
williamson
were
to
try
and
sledge
up
the
western
coast
to
help
campbell
gran
and
dimitri
were
to
stay
with
me
at
hut
point
the
surface
of
the
was
now
extremely
slushy
and
bad
for
pulling
the
ice
had
begun
to
extrude
its
salt
a
blizzard
started
in
their
faces
and
they
ran
for
shelter
to
the
lee
of
little
razorback
island
the
weather
clearing
they
pushed
on
to
the
glacier
tongue
and
camped
there
for
the
night
somewhat
some
difficulty
was
experienced
the
next
morning
in
climbing
the
on
to
the
peninsula
but
atkinson
using
his
knife
as
a
purchase
and
the
sledge
held
at
by
four
men
as
a
ladder
succeeded
eventually
in
getting
a
foothold
meanwhile
i
was
left
alone
at
hut
point
where
blizzards
raged
periodically
with
the
usual
creakings
and
groanings
of
the
old
hut
foolishly
i
accompanied
my
companions
when
they
started
for
cape
evans
as
far
as
the
bottom
of
ski
slope
when
i
left
them
i
found
i
could
not
keep
my
feet
on
the
slippery
snow
and
ice
patches
and
i
had
several
nasty
falls
in
one
of
which
i
gave
my
shoulder
a
twist
it
was
this
shaking
combined
with
the
rather
desperate
conditions
which
caused
a
more
acute
state
of
illness
and
sickness
than
i
had
experienced
for
some
time
some
of
those
days
i
remained
alone
at
hut
point
i
was
too
weak
to
do
more
than
crawl
on
my
hands
and
knees
about
the
hut
i
had
to
get
blubber
from
the
door
to
feed
the
fire
and
chop
up
to
eat
to
cook
and
to
tend
the
dogs
some
of
whom
were
loose
while
most
of
them
were
tied
in
the
verandah
or
between
the
hut
door
and
vince
cross
the
hut
was
bitterly
cold
with
only
one
man
in
it
had
there
not
been
some
morphia
among
the
stores
brought
down
from
cape
evans
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
have
done
the
dogs
realized
that
they
could
take
liberties
which
they
would
not
have
dared
to
do
in
different
circumstances
they
whined
and
growled
and
squabbled
amongst
themselves
all
the
time
day
and
night
seven
or
eight
times
one
day
i
crawled
across
the
floor
to
try
and
lay
my
hands
upon
one
dog
who
was
the
ringleader
i
was
sure
it
was
dyk
but
never
detected
him
in
the
act
and
though
i
thrashed
him
with
difficulty
as
a
speculation
the
result
was
not
encouraging
i
would
willingly
have
killed
the
lot
of
them
just
then
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
lay
in
my
with
the
floor
of
the
hut
falling
from
me
or
its
walls
disappearing
in
the
distance
and
coming
back
and
roused
myself
at
intervals
to
feed
blubber
to
the
stove
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
delivered
out
of
hell
when
the
relief
party
arrived
on
the
night
of
april
i
had
been
alone
four
days
and
i
think
a
few
more
days
would
have
sent
me
off
my
head
not
the
least
welcome
of
the
things
they
had
brought
me
were
my
letters
copies
of
the
weekly
times
a
pair
of
felt
shoes
and
a
comb
atkinson
plan
was
to
start
on
april
over
the
old
which
lay
to
the
south
and
of
us
he
was
to
take
with
him
wright
keohane
and
williamson
and
they
wanted
to
reach
butter
point
and
thence
to
sledge
up
the
western
coast
if
the
was
in
and
campbell
was
sledging
down
upon
it
they
hoped
to
meet
him
and
might
be
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
him
even
if
they
did
not
meet
him
they
could
mark
more
obviously
certain
depôts
of
which
he
had
no
knowledge
left
by
our
own
geological
parties
on
the
route
he
must
follow
as
i
have
already
mentioned
these
were
on
cape
roberts
off
granite
harbour
and
on
cape
bernacchi
north
of
new
harbour
there
was
also
a
depôt
at
butter
point
but
campbell
already
knew
of
this
they
could
also
leave
instructions
to
this
effect
at
points
where
he
would
be
likely
to
see
them
there
was
no
question
that
there
was
grave
risk
in
this
journey
not
only
was
the
winter
approaching
and
the
daylight
limited
but
the
over
which
they
must
march
was
most
dangerous
is
always
forming
and
being
blown
out
to
sea
or
just
floating
away
on
the
tide
at
this
time
of
year
the
amount
of
old
ice
which
had
remained
during
the
summer
was
certain
to
be
limited
the
new
ice
was
thin
and
might
take
them
out
with
it
at
any
time
however
what
could
be
done
had
to
be
done
before
they
left
certain
signals
by
means
of
rockets
and
véry
lights
were
arranged
to
be
sent
up
by
us
at
hut
point
if
campbell
arrived
signals
had
also
been
arranged
between
hut
point
and
cape
evans
in
view
of
certain
events
we
did
not
have
but
i
think
we
ought
to
have
had
some
form
of
portable
heliograph
for
communications
between
hut
point
and
cape
evans
when
the
sun
was
up
and
some
kind
of
lamp
signal
apparatus
to
use
during
the
winter
they
started
at
on
wednesday
april
the
sun
was
now
only
just
peeping
over
the
northern
horizon
at
and
would
disappear
entirely
in
six
more
days
though
of
course
there
was
a
long
twilight
as
yet
for
fresh
men
on
old
it
would
not
have
been
an
easy
venture
for
men
on
a
coast
where
the
ice
was
probably
freezing
and
blowing
out
at
odd
times
it
was
very
brave
they
had
hard
pulling
their
first
two
days
and
the
minimum
temperature
for
the
corresponding
nights
was
and
consequently
they
soon
began
to
be
iced
up
on
the
other
hand
they
found
old
and
made
good
some
miles
camping
on
the
evening
of
the
about
four
miles
from
the
eskers
next
morning
they
had
to
venture
upon
newly
frozen
ice
and
a
blizzard
wind
was
blowing
they
crossed
the
four
miles
from
their
night
camp
to
the
eskers
glad
enough
to
reach
land
the
other
side
without
the
ice
going
to
sea
with
them
they
then
turned
towards
the
butter
point
depôt
but
were
compelled
to
camp
owing
to
the
blizzard
which
came
on
with
full
force
the
rise
in
temperature
to
zero
caused
a
general
thaw
of
and
clothing
which
dried
but
little
when
the
sun
had
no
power
on
the
following
morning
they
reached
the
butter
point
depôt
which
they
found
with
difficulty
for
there
was
no
flag
standing
even
as
they
struck
their
camp
they
saw
the
ice
to
the
north
of
them
breaking
up
and
going
out
to
sea
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
turn
back
for
neither
could
they
go
north
to
campbell
nor
could
campbell
come
south
to
them
wright
now
told
atkinson
how
much
he
had
been
opposed
to
this
journey
all
along
he
had
come
on
this
trip
fully
believing
that
there
was
every
possibility
of
the
party
being
lost
but
had
never
demurred
and
never
offered
a
contrary
opinion
and
one
can
not
be
thankful
enough
to
such
men
they
made
up
the
butter
point
depôt
marked
it
as
well
as
they
could
in
case
campbell
should
arrive
there
and
left
two
weeks
provisions
for
him
they
could
do
no
more
they
got
back
to
the
eskers
that
same
day
and
anxiously
awaited
the
twilight
of
the
morning
to
reveal
the
state
of
the
new
which
they
had
crossed
on
their
outward
journey
to
their
joy
some
of
it
remained
and
they
started
to
do
the
four
miles
between
them
and
the
old
for
two
miles
they
ran
with
the
sail
set
then
they
had
a
hard
pull
and
some
emperor
penguins
whom
they
could
see
led
them
to
suppose
that
there
was
open
water
ahead
but
they
got
through
all
right
and
did
ten
miles
for
the
day
on
monday
blizzard
in
morning
so
started
late
and
made
for
end
of
pinnacled
ice
we
found
our
little
bay
of
all
gone
out
luckily
there
was
a
sort
of
around
the
pinnacled
ice
and
we
completed
seven
miles
and
got
through
april
atkinson
and
his
party
got
in
about
after
a
long
pull
all
day
in
very
bad
weather
they
are
just
in
the
state
of
a
party
which
has
been
out
on
a
very
cold
spring
journey
clothes
and
very
wet
sweaters
pyjama
coats
and
so
forth
full
of
snow
atkinson
looks
quite
done
up
his
cheeks
are
fallen
in
and
his
throat
shows
thin
wright
is
also
a
good
deal
done
up
and
the
whole
party
has
evidently
had
little
sleep
they
have
had
a
difficult
and
dangerous
trip
and
it
is
a
good
thing
they
are
in
and
they
are
fortunate
to
have
had
no
mishaps
for
the
is
constantly
going
out
over
there
and
when
they
were
on
it
they
never
knew
that
they
might
not
find
themselves
cut
off
from
the
shore
big
leads
were
constantly
opening
even
in
ice
over
a
foot
thick
and
with
little
wind
but
even
if
the
ice
had
been
in
i
do
not
believe
that
they
could
have
gone
many
days
that
same
day
the
sun
appeared
for
the
last
time
for
four
months
april
seemed
to
be
a
quite
good
day
when
we
woke
and
wright
keohane
and
gran
started
back
for
cape
evans
before
we
could
then
see
the
outline
of
inaccessible
island
and
the
ice
in
the
sound
looked
fairly
firm
so
they
determined
to
go
by
the
way
of
the
under
castle
rock
instead
of
going
along
the
peninsula
to
the
hutton
cliffs
soon
after
they
started
it
came
up
thick
and
by
it
was
blowing
a
mild
blizzard
with
a
low
temperature
we
felt
considerable
anxiety
especially
when
a
full
blizzard
set
in
with
a
temperature
down
to
and
we
could
not
see
how
the
ice
was
standing
it
two
days
later
it
cleared
and
that
night
a
flare
was
lit
at
cape
evans
at
a
time
by
which
signal
we
knew
that
they
had
arrived
safely
we
heard
afterwards
that
when
it
came
up
thick
they
decided
to
follow
the
land
which
was
the
only
thing
that
they
could
see
they
soon
found
that
the
ice
was
not
nearly
so
good
as
was
supposed
there
were
open
pools
of
water
and
some
of
the
ice
was
moving
up
and
down
with
their
weight
as
they
crossed
it
gran
put
his
foot
in
then
wright
went
ahead
with
the
alpine
rope
the
ice
being
blue
the
pulling
easy
and
the
wind
force
as
far
as
turtleback
island
the
ice
was
newly
frozen
but
after
that
they
knew
they
were
on
oldish
ice
they
were
lost
on
cape
evans
in
the
blizzard
for
some
time
but
eventually
found
the
hut
safely
one
of
the
lessons
of
this
expedition
is
that
too
little
care
was
taken
in
travelling
on
atkinson
dimitri
and
i
left
for
cape
evans
with
the
two
on
may
directly
we
started
it
was
evident
that
the
surface
was
very
bad
even
the
ice
near
hut
point
which
had
been
frozen
for
a
long
time
was
hard
pulling
for
the
dogs
and
when
after
less
than
a
mile
we
got
on
to
ice
which
had
frozen
quite
lately
the
sledges
were
running
on
snow
which
in
turn
lay
on
salt
sleet
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
we
got
abreast
of
castle
rock
following
close
along
the
land
for
the
weather
was
very
thick
when
we
started
we
could
just
see
the
outline
of
inaccessible
island
but
by
now
the
horizon
was
lost
in
the
dusk
and
haze
we
decided
to
push
on
to
turtleback
island
and
go
over
glacier
tongue
in
order
to
get
on
to
the
older
ice
as
soon
as
possible
the
dogs
began
to
get
very
done
manuki
noogis
who
had
been
harnessed
in
as
leader
for
rabchick
had
deserted
in
the
night
gave
in
completely
lay
down
and
refused
to
be
persuaded
to
go
on
we
had
to
cast
him
off
and
hope
that
he
would
follow
after
a
time
turtleback
island
was
visible
in
the
gloom
but
it
was
all
we
could
do
pushing
and
pulling
the
sledges
to
help
the
dogs
to
get
them
so
far
we
were
now
on
the
older
ice
our
way
was
easier
and
we
reached
cape
evans
without
further
incident
we
found
rabchick
on
arrival
but
no
manuki
noogis
who
never
reappeared
as
we
neared
the
cape
atkinson
turned
to
me
would
you
go
for
campbell
or
the
polar
party
next
year
he
said
campbell
i
answered
just
then
it
seemed
to
me
unthinkable
that
we
should
leave
live
men
to
search
for
those
who
were
dead

a

last

was
given
to

account
of
the
last
and
worst
year
any
of

survivors
spent
some
one
should
have
compelled
him
to
write
for
he
will
not
do
so
if
he
can
help
it
the
problems
which
presented
themselves
were
unique
in
the
history
of
arctic
travel
the
weather
conditions
which
had
to
be
faced
during
this
last
winter
were
such
as
had
never
been
met
in
mcmurdo
sound
the
sledging
personnel
had
lately
undergone
journeys
in
one
case
no
less
than
four
journeys
of
major
importance
until
they
were
absolutely
worn
out
the
successful
issue
of
the
party
was
a
triumph
of
good
management
and
good
fellowship
the
saving
clause
was
that
as
regards
hut
food
heat
clothing
and
the
domestic
life
generally
we
were
splendidly
found
to
the
north
of
us
some
hundreds
of
miles
away
campbell
party
of
six
men
must
be
fighting
for
their
lives
against
these
same
conditions
or
worse
unless
indeed
they
had
already
perished
on
their
way
south
we
knew
they
must
be
in
desperate
plight
but
probably
they
were
alive
the
point
in
their
favour
was
that
they
were
fresh
men
to
the
south
of
us
anywhere
between
us
and
the
pole
were
five
men
we
knew
must
be
dead
the
immediate
problem
which
presented
itself
was
how
best
to
use
the
resources
which
were
left
to
us
our
numbers
were
much
reduced
nine
men
had
gone
home
before
any
hint
of
tragedy
reached
them
two
men
had
been
landed
from
the
ship
we
were
thirteen
men
for
this
last
year
of
these
thirteen
it
was
almost
certain
that
debenham
would
be
unable
to
go
out
sledging
again
owing
to
an
injury
to
his
knee
archer
had
come
to
cook
and
not
to
sledge
and
it
was
also
doubtful
about
myself
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
sledging
numbers
for
the
last
summer
totalled
eleven
five
officers
and
six
men
we
were
well
provided
with
transport
having
the
seven
mules
sent
down
by
the
indian
government
which
were
excellent
animals
as
well
as
our
original
two
the
additional
dogs
brought
down
by
the
ship
were
with
two
exceptions
of
no
real
sledging
value
our
had
however
already
travelled
some
miles
on
the
barrier
alone
not
counting
the
work
they
had
done
between
hut
point
and
cape
evans
and
though
we
did
not
realize
it
at
this
time
they
were
sick
of
it
and
never
worked
again
with
that
dash
which
we
had
come
to
expect
of
them
the
first
thing
which
we
settled
about
the
winter
which
lay
ahead
of
us
was
that
so
far
as
possible
everything
should
go
on
as
usual
the
scientific
work
must
of
course
be
continued
and
there
were
the
dogs
and
mules
to
be
looked
after
a
to
be
kept
and
the
meteorological
observations
and
auroral
notes
to
be
taken
owing
to
our
reduced
numbers
we
should
need
the
help
of
the
seamen
for
this
purpose
we
were
also
to
bring
out
another
volume
of
the
south
polar
times
on
day
the
importance
of
not
allowing
any
sense
of
depression
to
become
a
part
of
the
atmosphere
of
our
life
was
clear
to
all
this
was
all
the
more
necessary
when
as
we
shall
see
the
constant
blizzards
confined
us
week
after
week
to
our
hut
even
when
we
did
get
a
fine
day
we
were
almost
entirely
confined
to
the
rocky
cape
for
our
exercise
and
walks
when
there
was
it
was
most
unsafe
atkinson
was
in
command
in
addition
he
and
dimitri
took
over
the
care
of
the
dogs
many
of
these
both
those
which
had
been
out
sledging
and
those
just
arrived
were
in
a
very
poor
state
and
a
dog
hospital
was
soon
built
at
this
date
we
had
dogs
left
from
the
last
year
and
dogs
brought
down
recently
by
the
ship
three
of
the
new
dogs
had
already
died
lashly
was
in
charge
of
the
seven
mules
which
were
allotted
to
seven
men
for
exercise
nelson
was
to
continue
his
marine
biological
work
wright
was
to
be
meteorologist
as
well
as
chemist
and
physicist
gran
was
in
charge
of
stores
and
would
help
wright
in
the
meteorological
observations
debenham
was
geologist
and
photographer
i
was
ordered
to
take
a
long
rest
but
could
do
the
zoological
work
the
south
polar
times
and
keep
the
official
account
of
the
expedition
from
day
to
day
crean
was
in
charge
of
sledging
stores
and
equipment
archer
was
cook
hooper
our
domestic
took
over
in
addition
the
working
of
the
acetylene
plant
there
was
plenty
of
work
for
our
other
two
seamen
keohane
and
williamson
in
the
daily
life
of
the
camp
and
in
preparations
for
the
sledging
season
to
come
the
blizzard
which
threatened
us
all
the
way
from
hut
point
on
may
broke
soon
after
we
got
in
the
ice
in
north
bay
which
had
been
frozen
for
some
time
was
taken
out
on
the
first
day
of
this
blizzard
with
the
exception
of
a
small
strip
running
close
along
the
shore
the
rest
followed
the
next
afternoon
when
the
wind
was
still
rising
and
blew
in
the
gusts
up
to
miles
an
hour
the
curious
thing
was
that
all
this
time
the
air
had
been
quite
clear
this
was
the
second
day
of
the
blizzard
the
wind
continued
in
violence
as
the
night
wore
on
and
it
began
to
snow
becoming
very
thick
from
to
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
there
was
a
continuous
rattle
of
sand
and
stones
up
against
the
wall
of
the
hut
the
greater
part
of
the
time
the
anemometer
head
was
choked
by
the
drifting
snow
and
debenham
whose
it
was
had
a
bad
time
in
clearing
it
at
during
the
period
when
it
was
working
it
registered
a
gust
of
over
miles
an
hour
while
it
was
not
working
there
came
a
gust
which
woke
most
people
up
and
which
was
a
far
more
powerful
one
making
a
regular
hail
of
stones
against
the
wall
the
next
morning
the
wind
was
found
to
be
averaging
miles
an
hour
when
the
anemometer
on
the
hill
was
checked
for
three
minutes
later
it
was
averaging
miles
an
hour
this
blizzard
continued
to
rage
all
this
day
and
the
next
but
on
may
which
was
one
of
those
clear
beautiful
days
when
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
it
can
ever
blow
again
we
could
see
something
of
the
damage
to
the
the
centre
of
the
sound
was
clear
of
ice
and
the
open
water
stretched
to
the
of
us
as
far
back
as
tent
island
we
were
to
have
many
worse
blizzards
during
this
winter
but
this
particular
blow
was
important
because
it
came
at
a
critical
time
in
the
freezing
over
of
the
sea
and
once
it
had
been
dispersed
the
winds
of
the
future
never
allowed
the
ice
to
form
again
sufficiently
thick
to
withstand
the
wind
forces
which
obtained
thus
i
find
in
my
diary
of
may
up
to
the
present
we
have
never
considered
the
possibility
of
the
sea
in
this
neighbourhood
and
the
sound
out
to
the
west
of
us
not
freezing
over
permanently
in
the
winter
but
here
there
is
still
open
water
and
it
seems
quite
possible
that
there
may
not
be
any
permanent
freezing
this
year
at
any
rate
to
the
north
of
inaccessible
island
and
this
cape
though
north
bay
is
now
frozen
over
the
ice
in
it
was
blown
away
during
the
night
and
having
been
blown
back
again
is
now
only
joined
to
the
by
newly
frozen
ice
during
this
winter
the
ice
formed
in
north
bay
was
constantly
moving
away
from
the
quite
independently
of
wind
i
watched
it
carefully
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
do
so
in
the
dark
sometimes
at
any
rate
the
southern
side
of
the
moved
out
not
only
northwards
from
the
land
but
also
slightly
westwards
from
the
glacier
face
to
the
the
ice
was
sometimes
pressed
closely
up
against
the
glacier
it
seemed
that
the
whole
sheet
was
subject
to
a
screw
movement
the
origin
of
which
was
somewhere
out
by
inaccessible
island
the
result
was
that
we
often
had
a
series
of
leads
of
newly
frozen
ice
stretching
out
for
some
forty
yards
to
an
older
piece
of
ice
each
lead
being
of
a
different
age
it
was
an
interesting
study
in
the
formation
of
covered
at
times
by
very
beautiful
but
it
was
dangerous
for
the
dogs
who
sometimes
did
not
realize
that
these
leads
were
not
strong
enough
to
bear
them
vaida
went
in
one
day
but
managed
to
scramble
out
on
the
far
side
he
was
induced
to
return
to
the
land
with
difficulty
just
before
the
whole
sheet
of
ice
upon
which
he
stood
floated
out
to
sea
noogis
good
leader
wandered
away
several
times
during
the
winter
once
at
any
rate
he
seems
to
have
been
carried
off
on
a
piece
of
ice
and
to
have
managed
to
swim
to
land
for
when
he
arrived
in
camp
his
coat
was
full
of
icy
slush
finally
he
disappeared
altogether
all
search
for
him
was
in
vain
and
we
never
found
out
what
had
happened
illustration
cape
evans
in
winter
wilson
del
vaida
was
a
strong
animal
who
must
have
about
doubled
his
weight
since
we
came
in
from
one
ton
and
he
became
quite
a
this
winter
waiting
at
the
door
to
be
patted
by
men
as
they
went
out
and
coming
in
sometimes
during
the
but
he
did
not
like
to
be
turned
out
in
the
morning
and
for
my
part
i
did
not
like
the
job
for
he
could
prove
very
nasty
we
allowed
a
good
many
of
the
dogs
to
be
loose
this
year
and
sometimes
when
standing
quietly
upon
a
rock
on
the
cape
three
or
four
of
the
dogs
passed
like
shadows
in
the
darkness
busily
hunting
the
for
seals
this
was
the
trouble
of
giving
them
their
freedom
and
i
regret
to
say
we
found
many
carcasses
of
seal
and
emperor
penguins
there
was
one
new
dog
lion
who
accompanied
me
sometimes
to
the
top
of
the
ramp
to
see
how
the
ice
lay
out
in
the
sound
he
seemed
as
interested
in
it
as
i
was
and
while
i
was
using
would
sit
and
gaze
out
over
the
sea
which
according
to
its
age
lay
white
or
black
at
our
feet
of
course
we
had
a
dog
called
peary
and
another
one
called
cooke
peary
was
killed
on
the
barrier
because
he
would
not
pull
cooke
however
was
still
with
us
and
seemed
to
have
been
ostracized
by
his
fellows
a
position
which
in
some
way
he
enjoyed
loose
dogs
chased
him
at
sight
and
when
cooke
appeared
and
others
were
about
a
regular
steeplechase
started
he
also
came
up
the
ramp
with
me
one
day
up
he
suddenly
turned
and
fled
for
the
hut
as
hard
as
he
could
go
three
other
dogs
came
round
the
rocks
in
full
chase
and
they
all
gave
the
impression
of
thoroughly
enjoying
themselves
the
question
of
what
ought
to
be
done
for
the
best
during
the
coming
sledging
season
must
have
been
in
the
minds
of
all
of
us
which
of
the
two
missing
parties
were
we
to
try
and
find
a
winter
journey
to
relieve
campbell
and
his
five
men
was
out
of
the
question
i
doubt
the
possibility
of
such
a
journey
to
evans
coves
with
fit
men
to
us
at
any
rate
it
was
unthinkable
also
if
we
could
do
the
double
journey
up
and
down
campbell
could
certainly
do
the
single
journey
down
add
to
this
that
there
was
every
sign
of
open
water
under
the
western
mountains
though
this
did
not
influence
us
much
when
the
decision
was
made
the
problem
as
it
presented
itself
to
us
was
much
as
follows
campbell
party
have
been
picked
up
by
the
terra
nova
pennell
meant
to
have
another
try
to
reach
him
on
his
way
north
and
it
was
probable
that
the
ship
would
not
be
able
to
communicate
again
with
cape
evans
owing
to
ice
on
the
other
hand
it
was
likely
that
the
ship
had
been
able
to
relieve
him
it
also
seemed
that
he
could
not
have
travelled
down
the
coast
at
this
time
owing
to
the
state
of
the
the
danger
to
him
and
his
men
was
primarily
during
the
winter
every
day
after
the
winter
his
danger
was
lessened
if
we
started
in
the
end
of
october
to
relieve
campbell
estimating
the
probable
date
of
arrival
of
the
ship
we
judged
that
we
could
reach
him
only
five
or
six
weeks
before
the
ship
relieved
him
all
the
same
campbell
and
his
men
might
be
alive
and
having
lived
through
the
winter
the
arrival
of
help
might
make
the
difference
between
life
and
death
on
the
other
hand
we
knew
that
the
polar
party
must
be
dead
they
might
be
anywhere
between
hut
point
and
the
pole
drifted
over
by
snow
or
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
crevasse
which
seemed
the
most
likely
thing
to
have
happened
from
the
upper
glacier
depôt
in
to
the
pole
that
is
the
whole
distance
of
the
plateau
journey
we
did
not
know
the
courses
they
had
steered
nor
the
position
of
their
depôts
for
lieutenant
evans
who
brought
back
the
last
return
party
was
invalided
home
and
neither
of
the
seamen
who
remained
of
this
party
knew
the
courses
after
the
experience
of
both
the
supporting
parties
on
their
way
down
the
beardmore
glacier
when
we
all
got
into
frightfully
crevassed
areas
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
the
polar
party
must
have
fallen
down
a
crevasse
the
weight
of
five
men
as
compared
with
the
four
men
and
three
men
of
the
other
return
parties
supported
this
theory
lashly
was
inclined
to
think
they
had
had
scurvy
the
true
solution
never
once
occurred
to
us
for
they
had
full
rations
for
a
very
much
longer
period
of
time
than
according
to
their
averages
to
they
were
likely
to
be
out
the
first
object
of
the
expedition
had
been
the
pole
if
some
record
was
not
found
their
success
or
failure
would
for
ever
remain
uncertain
was
it
due
not
only
to
the
men
and
their
relatives
but
also
to
the
expedition
to
ascertain
their
fate
if
possible
the
chance
of
finding
the
remains
of
the
southern
party
did
not
seem
very
great
at
the
same
time
scott
was
strict
about
leaving
notes
at
depôts
and
it
seemed
likely
that
he
would
have
left
some
record
at
the
upper
glacier
depôt
before
starting
to
descend
the
beardmore
glacier
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
whether
he
did
so
if
we
went
south
we
must
be
prepared
to
reach
this
depôt
farther
than
that
i
have
explained
we
could
not
track
him
on
the
other
hand
if
we
went
south
prepared
to
go
to
the
upper
glacier
depôt
the
number
of
sledging
men
necessary
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
had
no
depôts
would
not
allow
of
our
sending
a
second
party
to
relieve
campbell
it
was
with
all
this
in
our
minds
that
we
sat
down
one
evening
in
the
hut
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
the
problem
was
a
hard
one
on
the
one
hand
we
might
go
south
fail
entirely
to
find
any
trace
of
the
polar
party
and
while
we
were
fruitlessly
travelling
all
the
summer
men
might
die
for
want
of
help
on
the
other
hand
we
might
go
north
to
find
that
campbell
men
were
safe
and
as
a
consequence
the
fate
of
the
polar
party
and
the
result
of
their
efforts
might
remain
for
ever
unknown
were
we
to
forsake
men
who
might
be
alive
to
look
for
those
whom
we
knew
were
dead
these
were
the
points
put
by
atkinson
to
the
meeting
of
the
whole
party
he
expressed
his
own
conviction
that
we
should
go
south
and
then
each
member
was
asked
what
he
thought
no
one
was
for
going
north
one
member
only
did
not
vote
for
going
south
and
he
preferred
not
to
give
an
opinion
considering
the
complexity
of
the
question
i
was
surprised
by
this
unanimity
we
prepared
for
another
southern
journey
it
is
impossible
to
express
and
almost
impossible
to
imagine
how
difficult
it
was
to
make
this
decision
then
we
knew
nothing
now
we
know
all
and
nothing
is
harder
than
to
realize
in
the
light
of
facts
the
doubts
which
others
have
experienced
in
the
fog
of
uncertainty
our
winter
routine
worked
very
smoothly
inside
the
hut
we
had
a
good
deal
more
room
than
we
needed
but
this
allowed
of
certain
work
being
done
in
its
shelter
which
would
otherwise
have
had
to
be
done
outside
for
instance
we
cut
a
hole
through
the
floor
of
the
and
sledged
in
some
heavy
boulders
of
kenyte
lava
these
were
frozen
solidly
into
the
rock
upon
which
the
hut
was
built
by
the
simple
method
of
pouring
hot
water
over
them
and
the
pedestal
so
formed
was
used
by
wright
for
his
pendulum
observations
i
was
able
to
skin
a
number
of
birds
in
the
hut
which
incidentally
was
a
very
much
colder
place
in
consequence
of
the
reduction
in
our
numbers
the
wind
was
most
turbulent
during
this
winter
the
mean
velocity
of
the
wind
in
miles
per
hour
for
the
month
of
may
was
for
june
and
for
july
the
percentage
of
hours
when
the
wind
was
blowing
over
fresh
gale
strength
on
the
beaufort
scale
for
the
month
of
may
was
for
june
and
for
july
per
cent
of
the
whole
these
figures
speak
for
themselves
after
may
we
lived
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
raging
winds
and
blinding
drift
and
the
sea
at
our
door
was
never
allowed
to
freeze
permanently
after
the
blizzard
in
the
beginning
of
may
which
i
have
already
described
the
ice
round
the
point
of
cape
evans
and
that
in
north
bay
formed
to
a
considerable
thickness
we
put
a
thermometer
screen
out
upon
it
and
atkinson
started
a
through
a
hole
in
it
there
was
a
good
deal
of
competition
over
this
trap
the
seamen
started
a
rival
one
which
was
to
have
been
a
very
large
affair
though
it
narrowed
down
to
a
less
ambitious
business
before
it
was
finished
there
was
a
sound
of
cheering
one
morning
and
crean
came
in
triumph
from
his
with
a
catch
of
atkinson
last
catch
had
numbered
one
but
the
seals
had
found
his
a
new
hole
caught
fish
until
a
seal
found
it
one
of
these
fish
a
tremasome
had
a
parasitic
growth
over
the
dorsal
sheath
external
parasites
are
not
common
in
the
antarctic
and
this
was
an
interesting
find
on
june
dimitri
and
hooper
went
with
a
team
of
nine
dogs
to
and
from
hut
point
to
see
if
they
could
find
noogis
the
dog
which
had
left
us
on
our
return
on
may
there
was
plenty
of
food
for
him
to
pick
up
there
no
trace
of
him
could
be
found
the
party
reported
a
bad
running
surface
no
pressure
in
the
ice
as
was
the
case
the
former
year
but
a
large
open
working
crack
running
from
great
razorback
to
tent
island
there
were
big
snowdrifts
at
hut
point
as
indeed
was
already
the
case
at
cape
evans
during
the
first
days
of
june
we
got
down
into
the
minus
thirties
and
our
spirits
rose
as
the
thermometer
dropped
we
wanted
permanent
june
the
weather
changes
since
the
night
before
last
have
been
luckily
for
us
uncommon
thursday
evening
a
strong
northerly
wind
started
with
some
drift
and
this
increased
during
the
night
until
it
blew
over
forty
miles
an
hour
the
temperature
being
a
strong
wind
from
the
north
is
rare
and
generally
is
the
prelude
of
a
blizzard
this
northerly
wind
fell
towards
morning
and
the
day
was
calm
and
clear
the
temperature
falling
until
it
was
at
the
barometer
had
been
abnormally
low
during
the
day
being
only
at
noon
then
at
with
the
temperature
at
this
blizzard
broke
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
big
upward
jump
of
the
barometer
which
seemed
to
mark
the
beginning
of
the
blizzard
much
more
than
the
thermometer
which
did
not
rise
much
the
wind
during
the
night
was
very
high
blowing
and
miles
an
hour
for
hours
at
a
time
and
has
not
yet
shown
any
sign
of
diminishing
now
after
lunch
the
hut
is
straining
and
creaking
while
a
shower
of
stones
rattles
at
intervals
against
it
the
drift
is
generally
very
heavy
june
the
temperature
has
been
higher
about
zero
during
the
day
and
the
blizzard
shows
no
signs
of
falling
yet
the
gusts
are
still
of
a
very
high
velocity
a
large
quantity
of
ice
to
the
north
seems
to
have
gone
out
at
any
rate
our
narrow
strip
along
the
front
which
is
so
valuable
to
us
will
probably
be
permanent
now
june
a
most
turbulent
day
it
is
very
hard
to
settle
down
to
do
anything
read
or
write
with
such
a
turmoil
outside
the
hut
shaking
until
we
begin
to
wonder
how
long
it
will
stand
such
winds
most
of
the
time
the
wind
is
averaging
about
sixty
miles
an
hour
but
the
gusts
are
far
greater
and
at
times
it
seems
that
something
must
go
just
before
lunch
i
was
racking
my
brains
to
write
an
editorial
for
the
south
polar
times
and
had
congratulated
ourselves
on
having
the
which
is
still
in
north
bay
as
we
were
having
lunch
nelson
came
in
and
said
thermometers
have
gone
all
the
ice
in
north
bay
has
gone
the
part
immediately
next
to
the
shore
which
has
now
been
in
so
long
and
which
was
over
two
feet
thick
we
had
considered
sure
to
stay
on
it
has
gone
out
the
north
bay
thermometer
screen
with
its
instruments
which
was
placed
yards
out
the
some
shovels
and
a
sledge
with
a
crowbar
the
gusts
were
exceptionally
strong
at
lunch
and
the
ice
must
have
gone
out
very
quickly
there
was
no
sign
of
it
afterwards
though
it
was
not
drifting
much
and
we
could
see
some
distance
to
lose
this
ice
in
north
bay
is
a
great
disappointment
for
it
means
so
much
to
us
here
whether
we
have
ice
or
water
at
our
doors
we
are
now
pretty
well
confined
to
the
cape
both
for
our
own
exercise
and
that
of
the
mules
and
in
the
dark
it
is
very
rough
walking
but
if
the
ice
in
south
bay
were
to
follow
it
would
be
a
calamity
cutting
us
off
entirely
from
the
south
and
all
sledging
next
year
let
us
hope
we
shall
be
spared
this
this
blizzard
lasted
for
eight
days
up
till
then
the
longest
blizzard
we
had
experienced
it
died
as
it
had
lived
blowing
hard
to
the
last
averaging
miles
an
hour
from
the
south
and
then
miles
an
hour
from
the
north
finally
back
to
the
south
and
so
to
calm
to
sit
here
with
no
noise
of
wind
whistling
in
the
ventilator
calm
and
starlight
outside
and
north
bay
freezing
over
once
more
is
a
very
great
relief
it
is
noteworthy
that
this
clearance
of
the
ice
as
also
that
in
the
beginning
of
may
coincided
roughly
with
the
maximum
declination
of
the
moon
and
therefore
with
a
run
of
spring
tides
it
would
be
tedious
to
give
any
detailed
account
of
the
winds
and
drift
which
followed
night
and
day
there
were
few
days
which
did
not
produce
their
blizzard
but
in
contrast
the
hours
of
bright
starlight
were
very
beautiful
walking
home
over
the
cape
in
the
darkness
this
afternoon
i
saw
an
eruption
of
erebus
which
compared
with
anything
we
have
seen
here
before
was
very
big
it
looked
as
though
a
great
mass
of
flame
shot
up
some
thousands
of
feet
into
the
air
and
as
suddenly
as
it
rose
fell
again
rising
again
to
about
half
the
height
and
then
disappearing
there
was
then
a
great
column
of
steam
rising
from
the
crater
and
probably
so
debenham
asserts
it
was
not
a
flame
which
appeared
but
the
reflection
from
a
big
bubble
breaking
in
the
crater
afterwards
the
smoke
cloud
stretched
away
southwards
and
we
could
not
see
the
end
of
it
blizzard
followed
blizzard
and
at
the
beginning
of
july
we
had
four
days
which
were
the
thickest
i
have
ever
seen
generally
when
you
go
out
into
a
blizzard
the
drift
is
blown
from
your
face
and
clothes
and
though
you
can
not
see
your
hand
especially
on
a
dark
winter
day
the
wind
prevents
you
being
smothered
the
wind
also
prevents
the
land
tents
hut
and
cases
from
being
covered
but
during
this
blizzard
the
drift
drove
at
you
in
such
blankets
of
snow
that
your
person
was
immediately
blotted
out
your
face
covered
and
your
eyes
plugged
up
gran
lost
himself
for
some
time
on
the
hill
when
taking
the
observations
and
wright
had
difficulty
in
getting
back
from
the
magnetic
cave
men
had
narrow
escapes
of
losing
themselves
though
they
were
but
a
few
feet
from
the
hut
when
this
blizzard
cleared
the
camp
was
buried
and
even
on
unobstructed
surfaces
the
snowdrifts
averaged
four
feet
of
additional
depth
two
enormous
drifts
ran
down
to
the
sea
from
either
end
of
the
hut
i
do
not
think
we
ever
found
some
of
our
stores
again
but
the
larger
part
we
carried
up
to
the
higher
ground
behind
us
where
they
remained
fairly
clear
about
this
time
i
began
to
notice
large
sheets
of
anchor
ice
off
the
end
of
cape
evans
that
is
to
say
ice
forming
and
remaining
on
the
bottom
of
the
open
sea
now
also
the
open
water
was
extending
round
the
cape
into
the
south
bay
behind
us
but
it
was
too
dark
to
get
any
reliable
idea
of
the
distribution
of
ice
in
the
sound
we
were
afraid
that
we
were
cut
off
from
hut
point
but
i
do
not
believe
that
this
was
the
case
though
the
open
water
must
have
stretched
many
miles
to
the
south
in
the
middle
of
the
sound
the
days
when
it
was
clear
enough
even
to
potter
about
outside
the
hut
were
exceptional
god
was
very
angry
july
a
blizzard
during
the
night
and
after
breakfast
it
was
drifting
a
lot
while
we
were
having
service
some
of
the
men
went
over
the
camp
to
get
ice
for
water
the
had
been
blown
out
of
north
bay
and
the
men
supposed
that
the
sea
was
open
and
would
look
black
but
crean
tells
me
that
they
nearly
walked
over
the
and
when
it
cleared
later
we
saw
the
sea
as
white
as
the
itself
a
strip
of
ice
which
was
lying
out
in
the
bay
last
night
must
have
been
brought
in
by
the
tide
even
against
a
wind
of
some
forty
miles
an
hour
this
shows
what
an
influence
the
tides
and
currents
have
in
comparison
with
the
winds
for
just
at
this
time
we
are
having
very
big
tides
it
was
blowing
and
drifting
all
the
morning
and
the
tide
was
flowing
in
pressing
the
ice
in
under
the
to
such
an
extent
that
later
it
remained
there
though
the
tide
was
ebbing
and
a
strong
southerly
was
blowing
incidentally
the
bergs
which
were
grounded
in
our
neighbourhood
were
shifted
and
broken
about
considerably
by
these
high
winds
also
the
meteorological
screen
placed
on
the
ramp
the
year
before
was
broken
from
its
upright
which
had
snapped
in
the
middle
and
must
have
been
taken
up
into
the
air
and
so
out
to
sea
for
there
was
no
trace
of
it
to
be
found
wright
lost
two
doors
placed
over
the
entrance
to
the
magnetic
cave
when
he
lifted
them
they
were
taken
out
of
his
hands
by
the
wind
and
disappeared
into
the
air
and
were
never
seen
again
illustration
north
bay
and
the
barne
glacier
so
ready
was
the
sea
to
freeze
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
it
already
contained
large
numbers
of
ice
crystals
and
time
and
again
i
have
stood
upon
the
watching
the
tongues
of
the
winds
licking
up
the
waters
as
they
roared
their
way
out
to
sea
then
with
no
warning
there
would
come
suddenly
and
completely
a
lull
and
there
would
be
a
film
of
ice
covering
the
surface
of
the
sea
come
so
quickly
that
all
you
could
say
was
that
it
was
not
there
before
and
it
was
there
now
and
then
down
would
come
the
wind
again
and
it
was
gone
once
when
the
winter
had
gone
and
daylight
had
returned
i
stood
upon
the
end
of
the
cape
the
air
all
calm
around
me
and
there
away
a
full
blizzard
was
blowing
the
islands
and
even
the
berg
between
inaccessible
island
and
the
cape
were
totally
obscured
in
the
thickest
drift
the
top
of
the
drift
which
was
very
distinct
thinned
to
show
dimly
the
crest
of
inaccessible
island
turk
head
was
visible
and
erebus
quite
clear
in
fact
i
was
just
on
the
edge
of
a
thick
blizzard
blowing
down
the
strait
the
side
showing
as
a
perpendicular
wall
about
feet
high
and
travelling
i
should
say
about
miles
an
hour
a
roar
came
out
from
it
of
the
wind
and
waves
the
weather
conditions
were
extraordinarily
local
as
another
experience
will
show
atkinson
and
dimitri
were
off
to
hut
point
with
the
dogs
carrying
biscuit
and
pemmican
for
the
coming
search
journey
i
went
with
them
some
way
and
then
left
them
to
place
a
flag
upon
the
end
of
glacier
tongue
for
surveying
purposes
it
was
clear
and
bright
and
it
was
easy
to
get
a
sketch
of
the
bearings
of
the
islands
from
this
position
which
showed
how
great
a
portion
of
the
tongue
must
have
broken
off
in
the
autumn
of
i
anticipated
a
pleasant
walk
home
but
was
somewhat
alarmed
when
heavy
wind
and
drift
came
down
from
the
direction
of
the
hutton
cliffs
wearing
spectacles
and
being
unable
to
see
without
them
i
managed
to
steer
with
difficulty
by
the
sun
which
still
showed
dimly
through
the
drift
it
was
amazing
suddenly
to
walk
out
of
the
wall
of
drift
into
light
airs
at
little
razorback
island
one
minute
it
was
blowing
and
drifting
hard
and
i
could
see
almost
nothing
the
next
it
was
calm
save
for
little
whirlwinds
of
snow
formed
by
eddies
of
air
drawn
in
from
the
north
in
another
three
hundred
yards
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
north
on
this
day
atkinson
found
wind
force
and
temperature
at
hut
point
at
cape
evans
the
temperature
was
zero
and
men
were
sitting
on
the
rocks
and
smoking
in
the
sun
many
instances
might
be
given
to
show
how
local
our
weather
conditions
often
were
there
was
a
morning
some
time
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
when
we
awoke
to
one
of
our
usual
tearing
blizzards
we
had
had
some
days
of
calm
and
the
ice
had
frozen
sufficiently
for
the
to
be
lowered
again
but
that
it
would
not
stand
much
of
this
wind
was
obvious
and
after
breakfast
atkinson
stuck
out
his
jaw
and
said
he
was
going
to
lose
another
trap
for
any
dash
blizzard
he
and
keohane
sallied
forth
on
to
the
ice
lost
to
our
sight
immediately
in
the
darkness
and
drift
they
got
it
but
arrived
on
the
cape
in
quite
a
different
place
and
we
were
glad
to
see
them
back
soon
afterwards
the
ice
blew
out
much
credit
is
due
to
the
mule
leaders
that
they
were
able
to
exercise
their
animals
without
hurt
cape
evans
in
the
dark
strewn
with
great
boulders
with
the
open
sea
at
your
feet
is
no
easy
place
to
manage
a
very
and
excitable
mule
just
out
of
a
warm
stable
especially
if
this
is
his
first
outing
for
several
days
and
the
wind
is
blowing
fresh
and
you
are
not
sure
if
your
face
is
and
you
are
quite
sure
that
your
hands
are
but
the
exercise
was
carried
out
without
mishap
the
mules
themselves
were
most
anxious
to
go
out
and
when
pyaree
developed
a
housemaid
knee
and
was
kept
in
she
revenged
herself
upon
her
more
fortunate
companions
by
biting
each
one
hard
as
it
passed
her
head
on
its
way
to
and
from
the
door
gulab
was
the
biggest
handful
and
williamson
managed
him
with
skill
some
of
them
especially
lal
khan
were
very
playful
running
round
and
round
their
leaders
and
stopping
to
paw
the
ground
khan
sahib
on
the
other
hand
was
bored
yawning
continually
it
was
suggested
that
he
was
suffering
from
polar
ennui
altogether
they
reflected
the
greatest
credit
upon
lashly
who
groomed
them
every
day
and
took
the
greatest
care
of
them
they
were
subject
to
the
most
violent
fits
of
jealousy
being
much
disturbed
if
a
rival
got
undue
attention
the
dog
vaida
however
was
good
friends
with
them
all
going
down
the
line
and
rubbing
noses
with
them
in
their
stalls
the
food
of
the
mules
was
based
upon
that
given
by
oates
to
the
ponies
the
year
before
and
the
results
were
successful
the
accommodation
given
to
the
dogs
in
the
terra
nova
on
the
way
south
is
open
to
criticism
as
the
reader
may
remember
they
were
chained
on
the
top
of
the
deck
cargo
on
the
main
deck
and
of
course
had
a
horrible
time
during
the
gale
and
any
subsequent
bad
weather
which
did
not
however
last
very
long
but
it
was
quite
impossible
to
put
them
anywhere
else
for
every
square
inch
between
decks
was
so
packed
that
even
our
personal
belongings
for
more
than
two
years
were
reduced
to
one
small
uniform
case
any
seaman
will
easily
understand
that
to
build
houses
or
shelters
on
deck
over
and
above
what
we
had
already
was
out
of
the
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
doubt
whether
the
dogs
had
a
worse
time
than
we
during
that
gale
in
good
weather
at
sea
and
at
all
times
in
the
pack
they
were
comfortable
enough
but
future
explorers
might
consider
whether
they
can
give
their
dogs
more
shelter
during
the
winter
than
we
were
able
to
do
amundsen
whose
winter
quarters
were
on
the
barrier
itself
and
who
experienced
lower
temperatures
and
very
much
less
wind
than
was
our
lot
at
cape
evans
had
his
dogs
in
tents
and
let
them
run
loose
in
the
camp
during
the
day
tents
would
have
gone
in
the
winds
we
experienced
and
i
have
explained
that
we
had
no
snow
in
which
we
could
make
houses
as
was
done
by
amundsen
in
the
barrier
our
more
peaceable
dogs
were
allowed
to
run
loose
especially
during
this
last
winter
at
the
beginning
of
which
we
also
built
a
dog
hospital
we
should
have
liked
to
loose
them
all
but
if
we
did
so
they
immediately
flew
at
one
another
throats
we
might
perhaps
have
let
them
loose
if
we
had
first
taken
the
precaution
amundsen
took
and
muzzled
all
of
them
before
doing
so
the
sport
of
fighting
so
his
dogs
discovered
lost
all
its
charm
when
they
found
they
could
not
taste
blood
and
they
gave
it
up
and
ran
about
unmuzzled
and
happy
but
the
slaughter
among
the
seals
and
penguins
would
have
been
horrible
with
us
and
many
dogs
might
have
been
carried
away
on
the
breaking
the
ones
lay
under
the
lee
of
a
line
of
cases
each
in
his
own
hole
they
curled
up
quite
snugly
buried
in
the
snowdrift
when
blizzards
were
blowing
and
lay
exactly
in
the
same
way
when
sledging
on
the
barrier
the
first
duty
of
the
after
pitching
his
own
tent
being
to
dig
holes
for
each
of
his
dogs
it
may
be
that
these
conditions
are
more
natural
to
them
than
any
other
and
that
they
are
warmer
when
covered
by
the
drifted
snow
than
they
would
be
in
any
unwarmed
shelter
but
this
i
doubt
at
any
rate
they
throve
exceedingly
under
these
rigorous
conditions
soon
becoming
fat
and
healthy
after
the
hardest
sledge
journeys
and
their
sledging
record
is
a
very
fine
one
we
could
not
have
built
them
a
hut
as
it
was
we
left
our
magnetic
hut
a
far
smaller
affair
in
new
zealand
for
there
was
no
room
to
stow
it
on
the
ship
i
would
not
advise
housing
dogs
in
a
hut
built
with
a
roof
as
an
annexe
to
the
main
but
this
would
be
one
way
of
doing
it
if
you
are
prepared
to
stand
the
noise
and
smell
the
provided
by
spratt
weighed
oz
each
and
their
sledging
ration
was
lbs
a
day
given
to
them
after
they
reached
the
night
camp
we
made
seal
pemmican
for
them
and
tried
this
when
sledging
as
an
occasional
variation
on
biscuit
but
they
did
not
thrive
on
this
diet
the
oil
in
the
biscuits
caused
purgation
as
also
did
the
pemmican
the
fat
was
partly
undigested
and
the
excreta
were
eaten
the
ponies
also
ate
their
excreta
at
times
certain
dogs
were
confirmed
leather
eaters
and
we
carried
chains
for
them
on
camping
these
dogs
were
taken
out
of
their
canvas
and
harnesses
and
attached
to
the
sledge
by
the
chains
care
being
taken
that
they
could
not
get
at
the
food
on
the
sledge
when
sledging
amundsen
gave
his
dogs
pemmican
but
i
do
not
know
what
else
he
also
fed
dog
to
dog
i
do
not
know
whether
we
could
have
fed
dog
to
dog
for
ours
were
siberian
dogs
which
i
am
told
will
not
eat
one
another
at
amundsen
winter
quarters
he
gave
them
seal
flesh
and
blubber
one
day
and
dried
fish
the
next
on
the
long
voyage
south
in
the
fram
he
fed
his
dogs
on
dried
fish
and
three
times
a
week
gave
them
a
porridge
of
dried
fish
tallow
and
maize
meal
boiled
together
at
cape
evans
or
at
hut
point
our
dogs
were
given
plenty
of
biscuit
some
evenings
and
plenty
of
fresh
frozen
seal
at
other
times
our
worst
trouble
with
the
dogs
came
from
far
away
probably
from
asia
there
are
references
in
scott
diary
to
four
dogs
as
attacked
by
a
mysterious
disease
during
our
first
year
in
the
south
one
of
these
dogs
died
within
two
minutes
we
lost
many
more
dogs
the
last
year
and
atkinson
has
given
me
the
following
memorandum
upon
the
parasite
a
nematode
worm
which
was
discovered
later
to
be
the
cause
of
the
trouble
a
certain
proportion
of
the
dogs
became
infected
with
this
nematode
and
it
was
the
cause
of
their
death
mainly
in
the
second
year
it
was
present
at
the
time
the
expedition
started
all
down
the
pacific
side
of
asia
and
papua
and
there
was
an
examination
microscopically
of
all
dogs
imported
at
this
time
into
new
zealand
the
secondary
host
is
the
mosquito
culex
the
symptoms
varied
the
onset
was
usually
with
intense
pain
during
which
the
animal
yelled
and
groaned
this
was
cardiac
in
origin
and
referable
to
the
presence
of
the
mature
form
in
the
beast
there
was
marked
haematuria
and
the
animals
were
anaemic
from
actual
loss
of
haemoglobins
in
nearly
all
cases
there
was
paralysis
affecting
the
hindquarters
during
the
later
stages
which
tended
to
spread
upwards
and
finally
ended
in
death
the
probable
place
of
infection
was
vladivostok
before
the
dogs
were
put
on
board
ship
and
deported
to
new
zealand
the
only
method
of
coping
with
the
disease
is
prevention
of
infection
in
infected
areas
it
is
probable
that
the
mosquitoes
would
not
bite
after
the
dog
coat
had
been
rubbed
with
paraffin
or
mosquito
netting
might
be
placed
over
the
kennels
especially
at
night
time
the
larval
forms
were
found
microscopically
in
the
blood
and
one
mature
form
in
the
heart
we
were
too
careful
about
killing
animals
i
have
explained
how
campbell
party
was
landed
at
evans
coves
some
of
the
party
wanted
to
kill
some
seals
on
the
off
chance
of
the
ship
not
turning
up
to
relieve
them
this
was
before
they
were
in
any
way
alarmed
but
it
was
decided
that
life
might
be
taken
unnecessarily
if
they
did
this
and
that
winter
this
party
nearly
died
of
starvation
and
yet
this
country
has
allowed
penguins
to
be
killed
by
the
million
every
year
for
commerce
and
a
farthing
worth
of
blubber
we
never
killed
unless
it
was
necessary
and
what
we
had
to
kill
was
used
to
the
utmost
both
for
food
and
for
the
scientific
work
in
hand
the
first
emperor
penguin
we
ever
saw
at
cape
evans
was
captured
after
an
exciting
chase
outside
the
hut
in
the
middle
of
a
blizzard
he
kept
us
busy
for
days
the
zoologist
got
a
museum
skin
showing
some
variation
from
the
usual
coloration
a
skeleton
and
some
useful
observation
on
the
digestive
glands
the
parasitologist
got
a
new
we
all
had
a
change
of
diet
many
a
pheasant
has
died
for
less
there
were
plenty
of
weddell
seal
round
us
this
winter
but
they
kept
out
of
the
wind
and
in
the
water
for
the
most
part
the
sea
is
the
warm
place
of
the
antarctic
for
the
temperature
never
falls
below
about
and
a
seal
which
has
been
lying
out
on
the
ice
in
a
minus
thirty
temperature
and
perhaps
some
wind
must
feel
as
he
slips
into
the
sea
much
the
same
sensations
as
occur
to
us
when
we
walk
out
of
a
cold
english
winter
day
into
a
heated
conservatory
on
the
other
hand
a
seaman
went
out
into
north
bay
to
bathe
from
a
boat
in
the
full
sun
of
a
day
and
he
was
out
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
in
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sights
of
this
winter
was
to
see
the
seals
outlined
in
phosphorescent
light
swimming
and
hunting
in
the
dark
water
we
had
lectures
but
not
as
many
as
during
the
previous
winter
when
they
became
rather
excessive
and
we
included
outside
subjects
we
read
in
many
a
polar
book
of
the
depressions
and
trials
of
the
long
polar
night
but
thanks
to
gramophones
pianolas
variety
of
food
and
some
study
of
the
needs
both
of
mind
and
body
we
suffered
very
little
from
the
first
year
months
of
darkness
there
is
quite
a
store
of
novelty
in
living
in
the
dark
most
of
us
i
think
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
but
a
second
winter
with
some
of
your
best
friends
dead
and
others
in
great
difficulties
perhaps
dying
when
all
is
unknown
and
every
one
is
sledged
to
a
standstill
and
blizzards
blow
all
day
and
all
night
is
a
ghastly
experience
this
year
there
was
not
one
of
our
company
who
did
not
welcome
the
return
of
the
sun
with
thankfulness
all
the
more
so
since
he
came
back
to
a
land
of
blizzards
and
made
many
of
our
difficulties
more
easy
to
tackle
those
who
got
little
outside
exercise
were
more
affected
by
the
darkness
than
others
this
last
year
of
course
the
difficulties
of
getting
sufficient
outdoor
exercise
were
much
increased
variety
is
important
to
the
man
who
travels
in
polar
regions
at
all
events
those
who
went
away
on
sledging
expeditions
stood
the
life
more
successfully
than
those
whose
duties
tied
them
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
hut
other
things
being
equal
the
men
with
the
greatest
store
of
nervous
energy
came
best
through
this
expedition
having
more
imagination
they
have
a
worse
time
than
their
more
phlegmatic
companions
but
they
get
things
done
and
when
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
their
strength
of
mind
triumphed
over
their
weakness
of
body
if
you
want
a
good
polar
traveller
get
a
man
without
too
much
muscle
with
good
physical
tone
and
let
his
mind
be
on
wires
of
steel
and
if
you
ca
get
both
sacrifice
physique
and
bank
on
will
note
a
lecture
given
at
this
time
by
wright
on
barrier
surfaces
is
especially
interesting
with
relation
to
the
winter
journey
and
the
tragedy
of
the
polar
party
the
general
tend
of
friction
set
up
by
a
upon
snow
of
ordinary
temperature
may
be
called
true
friction
it
is
probable
that
the
runners
melt
to
an
infinitesimal
degree
the
millions
of
crystal
points
over
which
they
glide
the
sledge
is
running
upon
water
crystals
in
such
temperatures
are
larger
and
softer
than
those
encountered
in
low
temperatures
it
is
now
that
halos
may
be
seen
in
the
snow
almost
reaching
to
your
feet
as
you
pull
and
moving
forward
with
you
we
steered
sometimes
by
keeping
these
halos
at
a
certain
angle
to
us
my
experience
is
that
the
best
pulling
surface
is
at
an
air
temperature
of
about
fahr
wright
experience
is
that
below
during
summer
temperatures
on
the
barrier
the
surface
is
fairly
good
that
between
and
less
good
and
between
and
best
the
worst
is
from
upwards
the
worst
of
all
being
round
about
freezing
point
as
the
temperature
became
high
the
amount
of
ice
melted
by
this
sliding
friction
was
excessive
it
was
then
that
we
found
ice
forming
upon
the
runners
often
in
almost
microscopic
amounts
but
nevertheless
causing
the
sledges
to
drag
seriously
thus
on
the
beardmore
we
took
enormous
care
to
keep
our
runners
free
from
ice
by
scraping
them
at
every
halt
with
the
back
of
our
knives
this
ice
is
perhaps
formed
when
the
runners
sink
into
the
snow
to
an
unusual
depth
at
which
the
temperature
of
the
snow
is
sufficiently
low
to
freeze
the
water
previously
formed
by
friction
or
radiation
from
the
sun
on
to
a
dark
runner
in
very
low
temperatures
the
snow
crystals
become
very
small
and
very
hard
so
hard
that
they
will
scratch
the
runners
the
friction
set
up
by
runners
in
such
temperatures
may
be
known
as
friction
and
the
effect
as
experienced
by
us
during
the
winter
journey
and
elsewhere
is
much
like
pulling
a
sledge
over
sand
this
rolling
friction
is
that
of
snow
crystal
against
snow
crystal
if
the
barometer
is
rising
you
get
flat
crystals
on
the
ice
if
it
is
falling
you
get
mirage
and
a
blizzard
when
you
get
mirage
the
air
is
actually
coming
out
of
the
barrier
thus
far
wright
lecture
since
we
returned
i
have
had
a
talk
with
nansen
about
the
which
he
recommends
to
the
future
explorer
the
ideal
combines
lightness
and
strength
he
tells
me
that
he
would
always
have
metal
runners
in
high
temperatures
in
which
they
will
run
better
than
wood
in
cold
temperatures
wood
is
necessary
metal
is
stronger
than
wood
with
same
weight
he
has
never
used
but
he
suggests
the
possible
use
of
aluminium
or
magnesium
for
the
metal
and
he
would
also
have
wooden
runners
with
metal
runners
attached
to
be
used
alternately
if
needed
the
discovery
expedition
used
german
silver
and
it
failed
nansen
suggests
that
the
failure
was
due
to
the
fact
that
these
runners
were
fitted
at
home
the
effect
of
this
is
that
the
wood
shrinks
and
the
german
silver
is
not
quite
flat
the
fitting
should
be
done
on
the
spot
nansen
did
this
himself
on
the
fram
and
the
result
was
excellent
i
believe
that
these
discovery
runners
were
not
a
continuous
strip
of
metal
but
were
built
up
in
strips
which
tore
at
the
points
of
junction
before
it
is
fitted
german
silver
should
be
heated
red
hot
and
allowed
to
cool
this
makes
it
more
ductile
like
lead
and
therefore
less
springy
the
metal
should
be
as
thin
as
possible
as
runners
melt
the
crystals
and
so
run
on
water
metal
is
unsuitable
for
cold
snow
for
low
temperatures
therefore
nansen
would
have
wooden
runners
under
the
metal
the
metal
being
taken
off
when
cold
conditions
obtained
he
would
choose
such
wood
as
is
the
best
conductor
of
heat
he
tried
birch
wood
in
the
first
crossing
of
greenland
but
would
not
recommend
it
as
being
too
easily
broken
in
the
use
of
oak
ash
maple
and
doubtless
also
hickory
for
runners
the
rings
of
growth
of
the
tree
should
be
as
far
apart
as
possible
that
is
to
say
they
should
be
fast
growing
ash
with
narrow
rings
breaks
there
is
ash
and
ash
american
ash
is
no
good
for
this
purpose
some
norwegian
ash
is
useful
and
some
not
our
own
sledges
with
ash
runners
varied
enormously
the
runners
of
a
sledge
should
curve
slightly
the
centre
being
nearest
to
the
snow
the
runners
of
ski
should
curve
also
slightly
in
this
case
upwards
in
the
centre
from
the
snow
this
is
done
by
the
way
the
wood
is
cut
wood
always
dries
with
the
curve
from
the
heart
towards
the
outside
of
the
tree
during
our
last
year
we
had
six
new
norwegian
sledges
twelve
feet
long
brought
down
by
the
ship
with
tapered
runners
of
hickory
which
were
inches
broad
in
the
fore
part
and
inches
only
at
the
stern
i
believe
that
this
was
an
idea
of
scott
who
considered
that
the
broad
runner
in
front
would
press
down
a
path
for
the
tapered
part
which
followed
the
total
area
of
friction
being
much
less
we
took
one
of
them
into
south
bay
one
morning
and
tried
it
against
an
ordinary
sledge
putting
lbs
on
each
of
them
the
surface
included
fairly
soft
as
well
as
harder
and
more
rubbly
going
there
was
no
difference
of
opinion
that
the
sledge
with
the
tapered
runners
pulled
easier
and
later
we
used
these
sledges
on
the
barrier
with
great
success
if
some
instrument
could
be
devised
to
test
sledges
in
this
way
it
would
be
of
very
great
service
no
team
of
men
can
make
an
exact
estimate
of
the
run
of
their
own
sledge
let
alone
the
sledge
which
your
pony
or
your
dogs
are
pulling
yet
sledges
vary
enormously
and
it
would
be
an
excellent
thing
for
a
leader
to
be
able
to
test
his
sledges
before
buying
them
and
also
to
be
able
to
pick
out
the
best
for
his
more
important
sledge
journeys
i
believe
it
can
be
done
by
attaching
some
kind
of
balance
between
the
sledge
and
the
men
pulling
it
other
points
mentioned
by
nansen
are
as
follows
tarred
ski
are
good
the
snow
does
not
stick
so
much
this
probably
refers
to
the
norwegian
compound
known
as
fahrt
but
he
does
not
recommend
tarred
runners
for
sledges
having
had
experience
of
a
tent
of
chinese
silk
which
would
go
into
his
pocket
but
was
very
cold
he
recommends
a
double
tent
the
inner
lining
being
detached
so
that
ice
could
be
shaken
from
both
coverings
he
suggests
the
possibility
of
a
woollen
lining
being
warmer
than
cotton
or
silk
or
linen
i
am
however
of
opinion
that
wool
would
collect
more
moisture
from
the
cooker
and
it
certainly
would
be
far
more
difficult
to
shake
off
the
ice
for
four
men
he
would
have
two
and
a
central
pole
coming
down
between
them
and
the
made
in
one
piece
with
the
tent
for
three
men
a
for
such
a
journey
as
our
winter
journey
he
would
not
brush
rime
formed
upon
the
tent
by
the
steam
from
the
cooker
and
breath
from
the
inside
of
tent
before
striking
camp
the
more
of
it
the
warmer
he
considers
that
or
are
infinitely
warmer
than
single
bags
objections
of
discomfort
are
overcome
for
you
are
so
tired
you
go
to
sleep
anyway
i
would
however
recommend
the
explorer
to
read
scott
remarks
upon
the
same
subject
before
making
up
his
mind

he
would
have
made
them
so
god
sent
his
daylight
to
scatter
the
nightmares
of
the
darkness
i
can
remember
now
the
joy
of
an
august
day
when
the
sun
looked
over
the
rim
of
the
barne
glacier
and
my
shadow
lay
upon
the
snow
it
was
wonderful
what
a
friendly
thing
that
became
we
put
the
first
trace
upon
the
sunshine
recorder
there
was
talk
of
expeditions
to
cape
royds
and
hut
point
and
survey
parties
and
we
ate
our
luncheon
by
the
daylight
which
shone
through
the
newly
cleared
window
the
coming
search
journey
was
organized
to
reach
the
upper
glacier
depôt
and
the
plans
were
modelled
upon
the
polar
journey
of
the
year
before
but
now
we
had
no
extensive
depôts
on
the
barrier
it
was
intended
that
the
dogs
should
run
two
trips
out
to
corner
camp
during
this
spring
it
was
hoped
that
two
parties
of
four
men
each
might
be
able
to
ascend
the
beardmore
one
of
them
remaining
about
up
and
doing
geological
and
other
scientific
work
while
the
other
went
up
to
the
top
in
our
inmost
thoughts
we
were
full
of
doubts
and
fears
i
had
a
long
talk
with
lashly
who
asked
me
what
i
candidly
thought
had
happened
to
the
southern
party
i
told
him
a
crevasse
he
says
he
does
not
think
so
he
thinks
it
is
scurvy
talking
about
crevasses
he
says
that
on
the
return
of
the
second
return
party
they
came
right
over
the
south
of
mount
darwin
descending
about
feet
into
a
great
valley
down
which
they
travelled
towards
the
west
and
so
to
the
upper
glacier
depôt
i
believe
scott
told
evans
lieut
that
he
meant
to
come
back
this
same
way
then
the
stuff
they
got
into
above
the
cloudmaker
must
have
been
horrible
there
are
places
there
you
could
put
paul
into
and
that
no
exaggeration
neither
and
they
spent
two
nights
in
it
all
the
way
down
to
the
gateway
he
says
there
were
crevasses
great
big
fellows
thirty
feet
across
which
we
of
the
first
return
party
had
crossed
both
going
and
coming
back
and
which
we
never
saw
but
then
much
of
the
snow
had
gone
and
they
were
visible
lieut
evans
was
very
badly
snowblind
most
of
this
time
then
outside
the
gateway
on
the
barrier
they
crossed
many
crevasses
and
some
had
fallen
in
where
we
had
passed
over
them
this
makes
one
think
is
the
state
of
affairs
in
which
we
found
the
glacier
an
extraordinary
one
the
snow
being
a
special
phenomenon
due
to
that
great
blizzard
and
snowfall
are
we
going
to
find
blue
ice
this
year
where
we
found
thick
soft
snow
last
well
i
have
got
a
regular
bad
needle
again
just
as
i
have
had
before
but
somehow
the
needle
has
always
worked
off
when
we
get
right
into
it
what
a
blessing
it
is
that
things
are
seldom
as
bad
in
the
reality
as
you
expect
they
are
going
to
be
in
your
imagination
though
i
must
say
the
winter
journey
was
worse
even
than
i
had
imagined
i
remember
that
this
time
last
year
the
thought
of
the
beardmore
was
very
terrible
but
the
reality
was
never
very
bad
lashly
thinks
it
would
be
practically
impossible
for
five
men
to
disappear
down
a
crevasse
where
three
men
got
through
and
he
said
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
worse
stuff
than
they
came
through
five
men
would
be
still
better
off
this
is
not
my
view
however
i
think
that
the
extra
weight
of
one
man
might
make
all
the
difference
in
crossing
a
big
crevasse
and
if
several
men
fell
through
one
of
those
great
bridges
when
sledge
and
men
were
all
on
it
i
do
not
think
the
bridge
would
hold
the
sledge
several
trips
were
made
to
cape
royds
over
the
barne
glacier
and
then
by
portaging
over
the
rocks
to
shackleton
old
hut
the
sea
was
open
here
except
for
small
niches
of
ice
and
the
hut
and
the
cape
were
comparatively
free
from
drifts
probably
the
open
water
had
swallowed
the
drifting
snow
not
so
hut
point
which
was
surrounded
by
huge
drifts
the
verandah
which
we
had
built
up
as
a
stable
was
filled
from
floor
to
roof
there
was
no
to
be
seen
only
a
long
from
the
door
to
the
the
hut
itself
when
we
had
dug
our
way
into
it
was
clear
we
took
down
stores
for
the
search
journey
and
brought
back
with
us
the
only
surviving
these
instruments
which
indicate
by
a
clockwork
arrangement
the
distance
travelled
in
miles
and
yards
are
actuated
by
a
wheel
which
runs
behind
the
sledge
they
are
of
the
greatest
possible
use
especially
when
sledging
out
of
sight
of
land
on
the
barrier
or
plateau
and
we
bitterly
regretted
that
we
had
no
more
they
do
not
have
an
easy
time
on
a
glacier
and
we
lost
the
mechanism
of
one
of
our
three
polar
journey
meters
when
on
the
beardmore
is
hard
on
them
and
when
the
ponies
are
like
christopher
plays
the
very
deuce
anyway
we
found
we
had
only
one
left
for
this
year
and
this
was
more
or
less
a
dud
it
was
mended
so
far
as
possible
but
was
never
really
reliable
and
latterly
was
useless
a
lot
of
trouble
was
taken
by
lashly
to
make
another
with
a
bicycle
wheel
from
one
of
our
experimental
trucks
the
revolutions
of
which
were
marked
on
a
counter
which
was
almost
exactly
similar
to
one
of
our
anemometer
registers
a
bicycle
wheel
of
course
stood
much
higher
than
our
proper
and
a
difficulty
rose
in
fixing
it
to
the
sledge
so
as
to
prevent
its
wobbling
and
at
the
same
time
allow
it
the
necessary
amount
of
play
meanwhile
the
mules
were
being
brought
on
in
condition
with
daylight
and
improved
weather
they
were
exercised
with
loaded
sledges
on
the
which
still
remained
in
south
bay
they
went
like
lambs
and
were
evidently
used
to
the
work
gulab
was
a
troublesome
little
animal
he
had
no
objection
to
pulling
a
sledge
but
was
just
again
and
again
he
was
got
into
position
for
having
his
traces
hitched
on
and
each
time
some
little
thing
the
flapping
of
a
mitt
the
touch
of
the
trace
or
the
feel
of
the
bow
of
the
sledge
frightened
him
and
he
was
off
and
the
same
performance
had
to
be
repeated
once
harnessed
he
was
very
good
the
breast
harness
sent
down
for
them
by
the
indian
government
was
used
it
was
excellent
though
oates
i
believe
had
an
idea
that
collars
were
better
however
we
had
not
got
the
collars
the
mules
themselves
looked
very
fit
and
strong
our
only
doubt
was
whether
their
small
hoofs
would
sink
into
soft
snow
even
farther
than
the
ponies
had
done
no
record
of
this
expedition
would
be
complete
without
some
mention
of
the
cases
of
fire
which
occurred
the
first
was
in
the
lazarette
of
the
ship
on
the
voyage
to
cape
town
it
was
caused
by
an
overturned
lamp
and
easily
extinguished
the
second
was
during
our
first
winter
in
the
antarctic
when
there
was
a
fire
in
the
motor
shed
which
was
formed
by
full
petrol
cases
built
up
round
the
motors
and
roofed
with
a
tarpaulin
this
threatened
to
be
more
serious
but
was
also
put
out
without
much
difficulty
the
third
and
fourth
cases
were
during
the
winter
which
had
just
passed
and
were
both
inside
winter
quarters
wright
wanted
a
lamp
to
heat
a
shed
which
he
was
building
out
of
cases
and
tarpaulins
for
certain
of
his
work
he
brought
a
lamp
not
a
primus
into
the
hut
and
tried
to
make
it
work
he
spent
some
time
in
the
morning
on
this
and
after
lunch
nelson
joined
him
the
lamp
was
fitted
with
an
indicator
to
show
the
pressure
obtained
by
pumping
nelson
was
pumping
kneeling
at
the
end
of
the
table
next
the
bulkhead
which
divided
the
officers
and
men
quarters
his
head
was
level
with
the
lamp
and
the
indicator
was
not
showing
a
high
pressure
wright
was
standing
close
by
suddenly
the
lamp
burst
a
rent
three
inches
long
appearing
in
the
join
where
the
bottom
of
the
oil
reservoir
is
fitted
to
the
rest
of
the
bowl
twenty
places
were
alight
immediately
clothing
bedding
papers
and
patches
of
burning
oil
were
all
over
the
table
and
floor
luckily
everybody
was
in
the
hut
for
it
was
blowing
a
blizzard
and
minus
twenty
outside
they
were
very
quick
and
every
outbreak
was
stopped
on
september
it
was
blowing
as
if
it
would
rip
your
off
you
we
were
bagging
pemmican
in
the
hut
when
some
one
said
can
you
smell
burning
at
first
we
could
not
see
anything
wrong
and
gran
said
it
must
be
some
brown
paper
he
had
burnt
but
after
three
or
four
minutes
looking
upwards
we
saw
that
the
top
of
the
chimney
piping
was
red
hot
where
it
went
out
through
the
roof
as
was
also
a
large
ventilator
trap
which
entered
the
flue
at
this
point
we
put
salt
down
from
outside
and
the
fire
seemed
to
die
down
but
shortly
afterwards
the
ventilator
trap
fell
on
to
the
table
leaving
a
cake
of
burning
soot
exposed
this
luckily
did
not
fall
and
we
raked
it
down
into
buckets
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
all
the
chimney
started
blazing
again
the
flames
shooting
up
into
the
blizzard
outside
we
got
this
out
by
pushing
snow
in
at
the
top
and
holding
baths
and
buckets
below
to
catch
the
débris
we
then
did
what
we
ought
to
have
done
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
took
the
piping
down
and
cleaned
it
all
out
our
last
fire
was
a
little
business
debenham
and
i
were
at
hut
point
i
noticed
that
the
place
was
full
of
smoke
which
was
quite
usual
with
a
blubber
fire
but
afterwards
we
found
that
the
old
hut
was
alight
between
the
two
roofs
the
inner
roof
was
too
shaky
to
allow
one
to
walk
on
it
and
so
at
debenham
suggestion
we
bent
a
tube
which
was
lying
about
and
syphoned
some
water
up
with
complete
success
our
more
usual
fire
extinguishers
were
minimax
and
they
left
nothing
to
be
desired
indeed
all
they
left
were
the
acid
stains
on
the
material
touched
from
such
grim
considerations
it
is
a
pleasure
to
turn
to
the
life
we
now
led
emperor
penguins
began
to
visit
us
in
companies
up
to
forty
in
number
probably
they
were
birds
whose
maternal
or
paternal
instincts
had
been
thwarted
at
cape
crozier
and
had
now
taken
to
a
vagrant
life
they
suffered
i
am
afraid
from
the
loose
dogs
and
on
one
occasion
debenham
was
out
on
the
with
a
team
of
those
dogs
of
ours
which
were
useless
for
serious
sledging
he
had
taken
them
in
hand
and
formed
a
team
which
was
very
creditable
to
him
if
not
to
themselves
on
this
occasion
he
had
managed
with
great
difficulty
to
restrain
them
from
joining
a
company
of
emperors
the
dogs
were
frantic
the
emperors
undisturbed
unable
to
go
himself
one
dog
called
little
ginger
unselfishly
bit
through
the
harness
which
restrained
two
of
his
companions
and
debenham
helplessly
holding
the
straining
sledge
could
only
witness
the
slaughter
which
followed
the
first
skua
gull
arrived
on
october
and
we
knew
they
would
soon
breed
on
any
level
gravel
or
rock
free
from
snow
and
we
should
see
the
antarctic
petrels
again
and
perhaps
a
rare
snowy
petrel
and
the
first
whales
would
be
finding
their
way
into
mcmurdo
sound
also
the
weddells
the
common
coastal
seals
of
the
antarctic
were
now
in
the
beginning
of
october
leaving
the
open
water
and
lying
out
on
the
ice
they
were
nearly
all
females
and
getting
ready
to
give
birth
to
their
young
the
weddell
seal
is
black
on
top
and
splashed
with
silver
in
other
places
he
measures
up
to
feet
from
nose
to
tail
eats
fish
is
corpulent
and
hulking
he
sometimes
carries
four
inches
of
blubber
on
the
ice
he
is
one
of
the
most
sluggish
of
god
creatures
he
sleeps
continually
digests
huge
meals
and
grunts
gurgles
pipes
trills
and
whistles
in
the
most
engaging
way
in
the
sea
he
is
transformed
into
one
of
the
most
elastic
and
lithe
of
beasts
catching
his
fish
and
swallowing
them
whole
as
you
stand
over
his
his
head
appears
and
he
snorts
at
you
with
surprise
but
no
fear
opening
and
shutting
his
nostrils
the
while
as
he
takes
in
a
supply
of
fresh
air
it
is
clear
that
they
travel
for
many
miles
beneath
the
ice
and
i
expect
they
find
their
way
from
to
by
listening
to
the
noise
made
by
other
seals
some
of
the
are
exit
and
entrance
holes
as
well
and
i
found
at
least
one
seal
which
appeared
to
have
died
owing
to
its
opening
freezing
up
they
may
be
heard
at
times
grinding
these
holes
open
with
their
teeth
ponting
took
some
patient
cinematographs
showing
the
process
of
sawing
the
openings
to
these
wells
and
their
teeth
are
naturally
much
worn
by
the
time
they
become
old
wilson
states
that
they
are
liable
to
kidney
trouble
their
skin
is
often
irritable
which
may
be
due
to
the
drying
salt
from
the
sea
and
i
have
seen
one
seal
which
was
covered
with
a
suppurating
rash
their
spleens
are
sometimes
enormously
enlarged
when
they
first
come
out
of
the
sea
on
to
the
ice
which
is
interesting
because
no
one
seems
to
know
much
about
spleens
speculation
was
caused
amongst
us
by
the
fact
that
some
of
these
had
as
it
were
a
above
them
one
day
i
was
on
the
at
cape
evans
at
a
time
when
north
bay
was
frozen
over
with
about
an
inch
or
more
of
ice
a
seal
suddenly
poked
his
nose
up
through
this
ice
to
get
air
and
when
he
disappeared
a
slab
which
had
been
raised
by
his
head
fell
back
into
this
trap
position
clearly
this
was
the
origin
of
the
door
weddell
seals
and
the
hut
point
life
are
inextricably
mixed
up
in
my
recollections
of
october
atkinson
debenham
dimitri
and
i
went
down
to
hut
point
on
the
with
the
two
we
were
to
run
two
depôts
out
on
to
the
barrier
and
debenham
whose
leg
prevented
his
further
sledging
was
to
do
geological
work
and
a
plane
table
survey
those
of
us
who
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
travelling
of
the
two
previous
sledge
seasons
were
sick
of
sledging
for
my
own
part
i
confess
i
viewed
the
whole
proceedings
with
distaste
and
i
have
no
doubt
the
others
did
too
but
the
job
had
to
be
done
if
possible
and
there
was
no
good
in
saying
we
were
sick
of
it
from
beginning
to
end
of
this
year
men
not
only
laboured
willingly
but
put
their
hearts
and
souls
into
the
work
to
have
to
do
another
three
months
journey
seemed
bad
enough
and
to
leave
our
comfortable
winter
quarters
three
weeks
before
we
started
on
that
journey
was
an
additional
irritation
we
ran
down
in
surface
drift
it
was
thick
to
the
south
the
wind
bit
our
faces
and
hands
we
could
see
nothing
by
the
time
we
got
in
and
the
snow
was
falling
heavily
the
stable
was
full
of
beastly
snow
the
hut
was
cold
and
cheerless
and
there
was
no
blubber
for
the
stove
and
if
we
had
only
taken
the
ship
and
gone
home
when
the
period
for
which
we
had
joined
was
passed
we
might
have
been
in
london
for
the
last
six
months
but
then
the
snow
stopped
the
wind
went
down
and
the
mountain
tops
appeared
in
all
their
glorious
beauty
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
perfect
summer
afternoon
with
a
warm
sun
beating
on
the
rocks
as
we
walked
round
to
pram
point
there
were
many
seals
here
already
and
it
was
clear
that
the
place
would
form
a
jolly
nursery
this
year
for
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
movement
on
the
barrier
and
the
was
seamed
with
pressure
ridges
up
to
twenty
feet
in
height
the
hollows
were
buckled
until
the
sea
water
came
up
and
formed
frozen
ponds
which
would
thaw
later
into
lovely
baths
sheltered
from
the
wind
the
children
could
chase
their
ridiculous
tails
to
their
hearts
content
their
mothers
would
lie
and
sleep
awakening
every
now
and
then
to
scratch
themselves
with
their
long
not
quite
yet
but
they
were
not
far
away
lappy
one
of
our
dogs
who
always
looked
more
like
a
spaniel
than
anything
else
heard
one
under
the
ice
and
started
to
burrow
down
to
him
nearly
three
weeks
later
i
paid
several
more
visits
to
this
delightful
place
it
was
thick
with
seals
big
seals
and
little
seals
hairy
seals
and
woolly
seals
every
day
added
appreciably
to
the
number
of
babies
and
to
the
baaings
and
bleatings
which
made
the
place
sound
like
a
great
sheepfold
in
every
case
where
i
approached
the
mothers
opened
their
mouths
and
bellowed
at
me
to
keep
away
but
they
did
not
come
for
me
though
i
actually
stroked
one
baby
often
when
the
mother
bellowed
the
little
one
would
also
open
his
mouth
producing
just
the
ghost
of
a
bellow
not
because
he
seemed
afraid
of
us
but
rather
because
he
thought
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
as
indeed
it
probably
was
one
old
cow
was
marked
with
hoops
all
round
her
body
like
an
advertisement
of
michelin
tyres
only
the
hoops
were
but
an
inch
apart
from
one
another
and
seemed
to
be
formed
by
darker
and
longer
bands
of
hair
probably
something
to
do
with
the
summer
moult
two
cows
which
scrambled
out
of
the
same
hole
one
after
the
other
were
fighting
the
hinder
one
biting
the
other
savagely
as
she
made
an
ungainly
entrance
the
first
was
not
in
calf
the
aggressor
however
was
this
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
they
were
both
much
cut
about
and
bleeding
a
seal
is
never
so
pretty
as
when
he
is
a
baby
with
his
grey
woolly
coat
which
he
keeps
for
a
fortnight
his
comparatively
long
flippers
and
tail
and
his
big
dark
eyes
he
looks
very
clean
and
i
watched
one
running
round
and
round
after
his
tail
putting
his
flipper
under
his
head
as
a
pillow
and
scratching
himself
seemingly
as
happy
as
possible
yet
it
was
pretty
cold
with
some
wind
little
is
known
of
the
lighter
side
of
a
weddell
life
it
seems
probable
that
their
courtship
is
a
ponderous
affair
about
october
atkinson
found
an
embryo
of
about
a
fortnight
old
which
is
an
interesting
stage
and
this
was
preserved
with
many
others
we
found
but
all
of
them
were
too
old
to
be
of
any
real
value
i
think
there
is
a
good
deal
of
variation
in
the
size
of
the
calves
at
birth
there
is
certainly
much
difference
between
the
care
of
individual
mothers
some
of
which
are
most
concerned
when
you
approach
while
others
take
little
notice
or
lop
away
from
you
leaving
their
calf
to
look
after
itself
or
to
find
another
mother
sometimes
they
are
none
too
careful
not
to
roll
or
lie
on
their
calves
one
afternoon
i
drove
a
bull
seal
towards
a
cow
with
a
calf
the
cow
went
for
him
with
open
mouth
bellowing
and
most
disturbed
the
bull
defended
himself
as
best
he
might
but
absolutely
refused
to
take
the
offensive
the
calf
imitated
his
mother
as
best
he
could
meanwhile
atkinson
and
dimitri
took
some
and
to
a
point
twelve
miles
south
of
corner
camp
they
started
on
october
with
the
two
and
found
a
most
terrible
surface
on
the
barrier
the
sledges
sometimes
sinking
as
far
as
the
the
minimum
temperatures
the
first
two
nights
were
and
strong
blizzard
at
corner
camp
a
for
a
day
and
a
half
before
they
could
push
on
in
wind
and
drift
and
lay
the
depôt
the
dogs
ran
back
from
corner
camp
to
hut
point
on
october
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
three
miles
from
corner
camp
three
dogs
of
atkinson
team
fell
into
a
crevasse
one
of
them
falling
right
down
to
the
length
of
his
harness
the
rest
of
the
team
however
pulled
on
and
dragged
the
three
dogs
out
as
they
went
atkinson
lost
his
which
was
left
standing
in
the
snow
and
served
to
mark
a
place
to
be
avoided
altogether
a
rather
lucky
escape
two
men
out
alone
with
two
are
somewhat
helpless
in
case
of
emergency
on
october
dimitri
and
i
started
to
take
a
further
depôt
out
to
corner
camp
with
the
two
pulling
about
lbs
each
we
found
a
much
better
surface
than
that
experienced
by
atkinson
in
places
really
smooth
and
hard
it
is
good
to
be
out
again
in
such
weather
and
it
has
been
a
very
pleasant
day
the
minimum
was
only
that
night
and
we
reached
corner
camp
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
following
the
old
tracks
where
possible
and
halting
occasionally
to
hunt
when
we
lost
them
here
we
made
the
depôt
and
the
dogs
had
a
rest
of
hours
and
two
biscuits
it
was
quaint
to
see
them
waiting
for
more
food
for
they
knew
they
had
not
had
their
full
whack
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
that
the
barrier
had
moved
a
long
way
during
the
last
year
it
had
buckled
up
the
at
pram
point
there
were
at
least
three
new
and
undulations
before
reaching
corner
camp
and
the
camp
itself
had
moved
visibly
judged
by
the
bearings
and
sketches
we
possessed
i
believe
the
annual
movement
had
not
been
less
than
half
a
mile
corner
camp
is
a
trap
for
blizzards
on
the
line
of
their
exit
at
cape
crozier
and
it
was
clouding
up
the
barometer
falling
and
the
temperature
rising
rapidly
so
we
decided
to
come
back
some
way
and
have
in
the
end
come
right
back
to
the
biscuit
depôt
since
it
looked
very
threatening
to
the
east
here
the
temperature
is
lower
and
it
is
clearing
ross
island
has
been
largely
obscured
but
the
clouds
are
opening
on
terror
we
had
a
very
good
run
and
the
dogs
pulled
splendidly
making
light
work
of
it
miles
for
the
day
half
of
it
with
loaded
sledges
lappy
feet
are
bleeding
a
good
bit
owing
to
the
snow
balling
in
between
his
toes
where
the
hair
is
unusually
long
bullet
who
is
fat
and
did
not
pull
celebrated
his
arrival
in
camp
by
going
for
bielchik
who
had
pulled
splendidly
all
day
there
is
much
mirage
and
observation
hill
and
castle
rock
are
reversed
we
reached
hut
point
the
next
day
lappy
feet
were
still
bad
and
dimitri
wrapped
him
in
his
windproof
blouse
and
strapped
him
on
to
the
sledge
all
went
well
until
we
got
on
to
the
when
lappy
escaped
and
arrived
an
easy
first
is
the
devil
before
i
started
my
language
would
not
have
shamed
a
sunday
school
and
now
if
it
were
not
sunday
i
would
tell
you
more
about
it
it
takes
all
kinds
to
make
a
world
and
a
we
had
aristocrats
like
osman
and
bolsheviks
like
krisravitza
and
lunatics
like
the
employer
of
labour
might
stand
amazed
when
he
saw
a
crowd
of
prospective
workmen
go
mad
with
joy
at
the
sight
of
their
driver
approaching
them
with
a
harness
in
his
hands
the
most
ardent
trade
unionist
might
boil
with
rage
at
the
sight
of
eleven
or
thirteen
huskies
dragging
a
heavy
load
including
their
idle
master
over
the
floe
with
every
appearance
of
intense
joy
but
truth
to
tell
there
were
signs
that
they
were
getting
rather
sick
of
it
and
within
a
few
days
we
were
to
learn
that
dogs
can
chuck
their
paws
in
as
well
as
many
another
they
had
their
king
of
course
osman
was
that
they
combined
readily
and
with
immense
effect
against
any
companion
who
did
not
pull
his
weight
or
against
one
who
pulled
too
much
dyk
was
unpopular
among
them
for
when
the
team
of
which
he
was
a
member
was
halted
he
constantly
whined
and
tugged
at
his
harness
in
his
eagerness
to
go
on
this
did
not
allow
the
rest
of
the
team
to
rest
and
they
were
justifiably
resentful
sometimes
a
team
got
a
down
upon
a
dog
without
our
being
able
to
discover
their
doggy
reason
in
any
case
we
had
to
watch
carefully
to
prevent
them
carrying
out
their
intentions
their
method
of
punishment
always
being
the
same
and
ending
if
unchecked
in
what
they
probably
called
justice
and
we
called
murder
i
have
referred
to
the
crusts
on
the
barrier
where
the
snow
lies
in
layers
with
an
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
inch
or
more
between
them
these
will
subside
as
you
pass
over
them
giving
the
inexperienced
polar
traveller
some
nasty
moments
until
he
learns
that
they
are
not
crevasses
but
the
dogs
thought
they
were
rabbits
and
pounced
time
after
time
there
was
a
little
dog
called
mukaka
who
got
dragged
under
the
sledge
in
one
of
the
mad
penguin
rushes
the
made
when
we
were
landing
stores
from
the
terra
nova
his
back
was
hurt
and
afterwards
he
died
he
is
paired
with
a
fat
lazy
and
very
greedy
black
dog
noogis
by
name
and
in
every
march
this
sprightly
little
mukaka
will
once
or
twice
notice
that
noogis
is
not
pulling
and
will
jump
over
the
trace
bite
noogis
like
a
snap
and
be
back
again
in
his
own
place
before
the
fat
dog
knows
what
has
happened
then
there
was
stareek
which
is
the
russian
for
old
man
starouka
being
old
woman
he
is
quite
a
ridiculous
man
and
quite
the
nicest
quietest
cleverest
old
dog
i
have
ever
come
across
he
looks
in
face
as
though
he
knew
all
the
wickedness
of
all
the
world
and
all
its
cares
and
as
if
he
were
bored
to
death
by
them
he
was
the
leader
of
team
on
the
depôt
journey
but
decided
that
he
was
not
going
out
again
thereafter
when
he
thought
there
was
no
one
looking
he
walked
naturally
but
if
he
saw
you
looking
at
him
he
immediately
had
a
paw
limped
painfully
over
the
snow
and
looked
so
pitiful
that
only
brutes
like
us
could
think
of
putting
him
to
pull
a
sledge
we
tried
but
he
refused
to
work
and
his
final
victory
was
complete
one
more
story
dimitri
is
telling
us
how
a
funny
old
stareek
at
sydney
came
and
objected
to
his
treatment
of
the
dogs
which
were
more
than
half
wolves
and
would
eat
you
without
provocation
he
says
to
me
not
whip
i
say
ho
he
go
and
fetch
meares
he
try
put
me
in
choky
then
he
go
to
anton
give
anton
cigarette
and
match
he
say
old
that
horse
pointing
to
hackenschmidt
anton
say
very
young
he
not
believe
he
go
try
see
hackenschmidt
teeth
and
old
starouka
too
and
hackenschmidt
he
draw
back
and
he
rush
forward
and
bite
old
stareek
twice
and
he
fall
backwards
over
case
and
ole
woman
pick
him
up
he
very
white
beard
which
went
so
i
not
see
him
again

a
beautiful
day
we
finished
digging
out
the
stable
for
the
mules
this
morning
and
brought
in
some
blubber
this
afternoon
the
bluff
has
its
cap
on
but
otherwise
the
sky
is
nearly
clear
there
is
a
little
cumulus
between
white
island
and
the
bluff
the
first
i
have
seen
this
year
on
the
barrier
it
is
most
noticeable
how
much
snow
has
disappeared
off
the
rocks
and
shingle
here
hut
the
mule
party
under
wright
consisting
of

williamson
keohane
and

left

at
and
arrived
here
at
after
a
good
march
in
perfect
weather
they
leave
debenham
and
archer
at
the
hut
and
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
dull
work
for
them
the
next
three
months
archer
turned
out
early
and
made
some
cakes
which
they
have
brought
with
them
they
camped
for
lunch
seven
miles
from

illustration
the
mule
party
leaves
cape
evans
october
this
is
the
start
of
the
search
journey
everything
which
forethought
can
do
has
been
done
and
to
a
point
twelve
miles
south
of
corner
camp
the
mules
will
be
travelling
light
owing
to
the
depôts
which
have
been
laid
the
barometer
has
been
falling
the
last
few
days
and
is
now
low
while
the
bluff
is
overcast
yet
it
does
not
look
like
blizzard
to
come
two
adélie
penguins
the
first
came
to
cape
evans
yesterday
and
a
skua
was
seen
there
on
the
so
summer
is
really
here
hut
it
is
now
and
the
mules
are
just
off
looking
very
fit
keeping
well
together
and
giving
no
trouble
at
the
start
their
leaders
turned
in
this
afternoon
and
begins
the
new
routine
of
night
marching
just
the
same
as
last
year
it
did
look
thick
on
the
barrier
this
afternoon
and
it
was
quite
a
question
whether
it
was
advisable
for
them
to
start
but
it
is
rolling
away
now
being
apparently
only
fog
which
is
now
disappearing
before
some
wind
or
perhaps
because
the
sun
is
losing
its
power
i
think
they
will
have
a
good
march
atkinson
dimitri
and
i
with
two
left
hut
point
last
night
at
we
have
had
a
coldish
night
run
when
we
left
after
lunch
now
the
surface
was
very
heavy
for
the
dogs
there
being
a
soft
coating
of
snow
over
everything
since
we
last
came
this
way
due
no
doubt
to
the
foggy
days
we
have
been
having
lately
the
makes
it
nearly
miles
the
mule
party
has
two
days
start
on
us
and
their
programme
is
to
do
twelve
miles
a
day
to
one
ton
depôt
their
tracks
are
fairly
clear
but
there
has
been
some
drift
from
the
east
since
they
passed
we
picked
up
our
cairns
well
we
are
pretty
wet
having
been
running
nearly
all
the
way
early
morning
miles
we
are
here
at
corner
camp
but
not
without
a
struggle
we
left
the
biscuit
depôt
at
yesterday
and
it
is
now
the
last
six
miles
took
us
four
hours
which
is
very
bad
going
for
dogs
and
we
have
all
been
running
most
of
the
way
the
surface
was
very
bad
crusty
and
also
soft
it
was
blowing
with
some
low
drift
and
overcast
and
snowing
we
followed
the
mule
tracks
with
difficulty
and
are
lucky
to
have
got
so
far
the
temperature
has
been
a
constant
zero
there
is
a
note
here
from
wright
about
the
mules
which
left
here
last
night
they
only
saw
two
small
crevasses
on
the
way
but
khan
sahib
got
into
the
at
the
edge
of
the
barrier
and
had
to
be
hauled
out
with
a
rope
the
mules
are
going
fast
over
the
first
part
of
the
day
but
show
a
tendency
to
stop
towards
the
end
they
keep
well
together
except
khan
sahib
who
is
a
slower
mule
than
the
others
it
is
now
blowing
with
some
drift
but
nothing
bad
and
beyond
the
bluff
it
seems
to
be
clear
we
are
all
pretty
tired
early
well
this
has
been
a
disappointing
day
but
we
must
hope
that
all
will
turn
out
well
we
turned
out
at
yesterday
and
then
it
was
clearing
all
round
a
mild
blizzard
having
been
blowing
since
we
camped
we
started
at
five
in
some
wind
and
low
drift
it
was
good
travelling
weather
and
except
for
the
first
three
miles
the
surface
has
been
fair
to
good
and
the
last
part
very
good
yet
the
dogs
could
not
manage
their
load
which
according
to
programme
should
go
up
a
further
lbs
each
team
here
at
dimitri
depôt
one
of
our
dogs
kusoi
gave
out
but
we
managed
to
get
him
along
tied
to
the
stern
of
the
sledge
because
the
team
behind
tried
to
get
at
him
and
he
realized
he
had
better
mend
his
ways
we
camped
for
lunch
when
tresor
also
was
pretty
well
done
we
were
then
on
a
very
good
surface
but
were
often
pushing
the
sledge
to
get
it
along
the
mule
party
were
gone
when
we
started
again
and
probably
did
not
see
us
we
came
on
to
the
depôt
but
we
can
not
hope
to
get
along
far
on
bad
surfaces
if
we
can
not
get
along
on
good
ones
the
note
left
by
wright
states
that
their
has
proved
useless
and
this
leaves
all
three
parties
of
us
with
only
one
which
is
not
very
reliable
now
so
it
has
been
decided
that
the
dogs
must
return
from
or
at
the
farthest
and
instead
of
four
mules
as
was
intended
going
on
from
there
five
must
go
on
instead
the
dogs
can
therefore
now
leave
behind
much
of
their
own
weights
and
take
on
the
mules
weights
instead
and
this
is
the
part
where
the
mules
weights
are
so
heavy
perhaps
the
new
scheme
is
the
best
but
it
puts
everything
on
the
mules
from
if
they
will
do
it
all
is
well
if
they
wo
we
have
nothing
to
fall
back
on
november
it
has
been
blowing
and
drifting
all
day
we
turned
out
again
at
on
the
and
the
depôt
with
what
we
were
to
leave
owing
to
the
new
programme
this
is
all
rather
sad
but
it
ca
be
helped
it
was
then
blowing
a
summer
blizzard
and
we
were
getting
when
we
started
following
the
mule
tracks
there
were
plenty
of
cairns
for
us
to
pick
up
and
with
the
lighter
loads
and
a
very
good
surface
we
came
along
much
better
lunching
at
eight
miles
we
arrived
just
as
the
mule
party
had
finished
their
hoosh
preparatory
to
starting
and
it
has
been
decided
that
the
mules
are
not
to
go
on
but
we
will
all
start
marching
together
the
news
from
this
party
is
on
the
whole
good
not
the
least
good
being
that
the
is
working
again
though
not
very
reliably
they
are
marching
well
and
at
a
great
pace
except
for
khan
sahib
gulab
however
is
terribly
chafed
both
by
his
collar
and
by
his
breast
harness
both
of
which
have
been
tried
he
has
a
great
raw
place
where
this
fits
on
one
side
and
is
chafed
but
not
so
badly
on
the
other
side
lal
khan
is
pulling
well
but
is
eating
very
little
pyaree
is
doing
very
well
but
has
some
difficulty
in
lifting
her
leg
when
in
soft
snow
abdullah
seems
to
be
considered
the
best
mule
at
present
on
the
whole
good
hearing
wright
is
bad
letting
in
light
through
cracks
in
a
good
many
places
but
he
makes
very
little
of
it
and
does
not
seem
to
be
cold
saying
it
is
good
ventilation
the
mule
cloths
which
have
a
rough
lining
to
their
outside
canvas
are
collecting
a
lot
of
snow
and
all
the
mules
are
matted
with
cakes
of
snow
they
are
terrible
anything
to
eat
though
they
are
not
hungry
and
they
have
even
learnt
to
pull
their
picketing
buckles
undone
and
go
walking
about
the
camp
indeed
nelson
says
that
the
only
time
when
khan
sahib
does
not
cast
himself
adrift
is
when
he
is
ready
to
start
on
the
march
early
we
had
a
really
good
yesterday
and
after
the
hard
slogging
with
the
dogs
during
the
last
few
days
i
for
one
was
very
glad
of
it
we
came
on
behind
and
in
sight
of
the
mules
this
last
march
and
the
change
in
the
dogs
was
wonderful
where
it
had
been
a
job
to
urge
them
on
over
quite
as
good
a
surface
yesterday
for
some
time
we
could
not
get
off
the
sledge
except
for
short
runs
although
we
had
taken
lbs
weight
off
the
mules
and
loaded
it
on
to
the
dogs
we
had
a
most
glorious
night
for
marching
and
it
is
now
bright
sunlight
and
the
animals
fur
is
quite
warm
where
the
sun
strikes
it
we
have
just
had
a
bit
of
a
fight
over
the
vaida
going
for
dyk
and
now
the
others
are
somewhat
excited
and
there
are
constant
growlings
and
murmurings
the
camp
makes
more
of
a
mark
than
last
year
for
the
mules
are
dark
while
the
ponies
were
white
or
grey
and
the
cloths
are
brown
instead
of
light
green
the
consequence
is
that
the
camp
shows
up
from
a
long
distance
off
we
are
building
cairns
at
regular
distances
and
there
should
be
no
difficulty
in
keeping
on
the
course
in
fair
weather
at
any
rate
now
in
the
land
of
big
sastrugi
erebus
is
beginning
to
look
small
but
we
could
see
an
unusually
big
smoke
from
the
crater
all
day
early
not
an
easy
day
it
was
and
overcast
when
we
turned
out
and
the
wind
was
then
dying
down
but
it
had
been
blowing
up
to
force
with
surface
drift
during
the
day
we
started
in
a
bad
light
and
the
surface
which
was
the
usual
hard
surface
common
here
with
big
sastrugi
was
covered
by
a
thin
layer
of
crystals
which
were
then
falling
this
naturally
made
it
very
much
harder
pulling
we
with
the
dogs
have
been
running
nearly
all
the
twelve
miles
and
i
for
one
am
tired
at
lunch
atkinson
thought
he
saw
a
tent
away
to
our
right
the
very
thought
of
it
came
as
a
shock
but
it
proved
to
be
a
false
alarm
we
have
been
keeping
a
sharp
for
the
gear
which
was
left
about
this
part
by
the
last
return
party
but
have
seen
no
sign
of
it
it
is
now
but
the
sun
is
shining
brightly
in
a
clear
sky
and
it
feels
beautifully
warm
it
seems
a
very
regular
thing
for
the
sky
to
cloud
over
as
the
sun
gets
low
towards
nightfall
and
directly
the
sun
begins
to
rise
again
the
clouds
disappear
in
a
most
wonderful
way
early
last
night
twelve
miles
was
quite
cold
for
the
time
of
year
being
at
lunch
and
now
but
it
is
calm
with
bright
sun
and
this
temperature
feels
warm
however
there
are
some
as
a
result
both
nelson
and
hooper
having
swollen
faces
the
same
powder
and
crystals
have
been
on
the
surface
but
we
have
carried
the
good
bluff
surface
so
far
being
now
four
miles
beyond
bluff
depôt
this
is
fortunate
and
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
we
were
already
getting
on
to
a
soft
surface
at
this
point
last
summer
if
so
there
must
have
been
more
wind
here
this
year
than
last
which
according
to
the
winter
we
have
had
seems
probable
we
made
up
the
bluff
depôt
after
lunch
putting
up
a
new
flag
and
building
up
the
cairn
leaving
two
cases
of
for
the
returning
it
is
curious
that
the
drift
to
leeward
of
the
cairn
that
is
was
quite
soft
the
snow
all
round
and
the
drifts
on
either
side
being
hard
exceptionally
hard
in
fact
why
this
drift
should
remain
soft
when
a
drift
in
the
same
place
is
usually
hard
is
difficult
to
explain
all
is
happy
in
the
mule
camp
they
have
given
lal
a
drink
of
water
and
he
has
started
to
eat
which
is
good
news
some
of
the
mules
seem
and
they
are
now
all
wearing
their
blinkers
i
have
just
heard
that
gran
swung
the
thermometer
at
four
this
morning
and
found
it
nelson
face
is
a
sight
his
nose
a
mere
swollen
lump
cheeks
and
his
goggles
have
frosted
him
where
the
rims
touched
his
face
poor
marie
early
twelve
more
miles
to
the
good
and
we
must
consider
ourselves
fortunate
in
still
carrying
on
the
same
good
surface
which
is
almost
if
not
quite
as
good
as
that
of
yesterday
this
is
the
only
time
i
have
ever
seen
a
hard
surface
here
not
more
than
fifteen
miles
from
one
ton
and
it
looks
as
if
there
had
been
much
higher
winds
the
sastrugi
which
have
been
facing
are
now
beginning
to
run
a
little
more
westerly
i
believe
this
to
be
quite
a
different
wind
circulation
from
ross
island
which
as
a
whole
gets
its
wind
from
the
bluff
the
bluff
is
i
believe
the
dividing
line
though
big
general
blizzards
sweep
over
the
whole
irrespective
of
local
areas
of
circulation
this
was
amply
corroborated
by
our
journey
out
here
last
autumn
well
this
is
better
than
then
just
round
here
we
had
a
full
blizzard
and
early
a
perfect
night
for
marching
but
about
and
chilly
for
waiting
about
the
mules
are
going
well
but
lal
khan
is
thinning
down
a
lot
abdullah
and
khan
sahib
are
also
off
their
feed
their
original
allowance
of
lbs
oats
and
oilcake
has
been
reduced
to
and
they
are
not
eating
this
the
dogs
took
another
lbs
off
them
and
pulled
it
very
well
the
surface
has
been
splendidly
hard
which
is
most
surprising
wright
does
not
think
that
there
has
been
an
abnormal
deposition
of
snow
the
last
winter
he
says
it
is
about
feet
which
is
much
the
same
as
last
year
the
mules
are
generally
not
sinking
in
more
than
two
inches
but
in
places
especially
latterly
they
have
been
in
five
or
six
this
is
the
first
we
have
had
this
year
of
crusts
and
some
of
them
have
been
exceptionally
big
two
at
lunch
must
have
lasted
several
seconds
the
dogs
seem
to
think
the
devil
is
after
them
when
one
of
these
goes
off
and
put
on
a
terrific
spurt
it
is
interesting
to
watch
them
snuffing
in
the
of
the
mules
where
there
is
evidently
some
scent
left
in
these
temperatures
they
are
always
kicking
their
legs
about
at
the
halts
as
the
sun
gained
power
this
morning
a
thick
fog
came
up
very
suddenly
i
believe
this
is
a
sign
of
good
weather
illustration
the
dog
party
leaves
hut
point
november
early
morning
one
ton
wright
got
a
latitude
sight
yesterday
putting
us
six
miles
from
one
ton
and
our
shows
and
here
we
are
more
this
morning
and
it
was
pretty
cold
starting
in
a
fair
wind
and
temperature
we
have
continued
this
really
splendid
surface
and
now
the
sastrugi
are
pointing
a
little
more
to
the
south
of
while
there
are
not
such
big
mounds
the
surface
does
not
yet
show
any
signs
of
getting
bad
there
were
the
most
beautiful
as
we
came
along
a
deep
black
to
the
west
shading
into
long
lines
of
grey
and
lemon
yellow
round
the
sun
with
a
vertical
shaft
through
them
and
a
bright
orange
horizon
now
there
is
a
brilliant
parhelion
given
sun
two
days
here
are
never
alike
whatever
the
monotony
of
the
barrier
may
be
there
is
endless
variety
in
the
sky
and
i
do
not
believe
that
anywhere
in
the
world
such
beautiful
colours
are
to
be
seen
i
had
a
fair
panic
as
we
came
up
to
the
depôt
i
did
not
see
that
one
body
of
the
ponies
had
gone
ahead
of
the
others
and
camped
but
ahead
of
the
travelling
ponies
was
the
depôt
looking
very
black
and
i
thought
that
there
was
a
tent
it
would
be
too
terrible
to
find
that
though
one
knew
that
we
had
done
all
that
we
could
if
we
had
done
something
different
we
could
have
saved
them
and
then
we
find
that
the
provisions
we
left
here
for
them
in
the
tank
are
soaked
with
paraffin
how
this
has
happened
is
a
mystery
but
i
think
that
the
oil
in
the
xs
tin
which
was
very
full
must
have
forced
its
way
out
in
a
sudden
rise
of
temperature
in
a
winter
blizzard
and
though
the
tin
was
not
touching
the
tank
it
has
found
its
way
in
altogether
things
seemed
rather
dismal
but
a
visit
to
the
mules
is
cheering
for
they
seem
very
fit
as
a
whole
and
their
leaders
are
cheerful
there
are
three
sacks
of
oats
here
had
we
known
it
would
have
saved
a
lot
of
weight
but
we
did
and
we
have
plenty
with
what
we
have
brought
so
they
will
be
of
little
use
to
us
there
is
no
compressed
fodder
which
would
have
been
very
useful
for
the
animals
which
are
refusing
the
oats
would
probably
eat
it
gulab
has
a
very
bad
chafe
but
he
is
otherwise
fit
and
it
does
not
seem
possible
in
this
life
to
kill
a
mule
because
of
chafing
it
is
a
great
deal
to
know
that
he
does
not
seem
to
be
hurt
by
it
and
pulls
away
gallantly
crean
says
he
had
to
run
a
mile
this
morning
with
rani
marie
says
he
is
inventing
some
new
ways
of
walking
one
step
forward
and
one
hop
back
in
order
to
keep
warm
when
leading
khan
sahib
up
to
date
we
can
not
say
that
the
fates
have
been
unkind
to
us
early
morning
i
am
afraid
our
do
not
agree
over
this
morning
march
the
programme
is
to
do
thirteen
miles
a
day
if
possible
from
here
that
is
before
lunch
and
afterwards
we
could
see
two
cairns
of
last
year
on
our
right
as
we
came
along
we
have
got
on
to
a
softer
surface
now
and
there
is
bad
news
of
lal
khan
and
it
will
depend
on
this
march
whether
he
must
be
shot
this
evening
or
not
it
was
intended
to
shoot
a
mule
two
marches
from
one
ton
but
till
just
lately
it
had
not
been
thought
that
it
must
be
lal
khan
he
is
getting
very
slow
and
came
into
camp
with
khan
sahib
the
trouble
of
course
is
that
he
will
not
eat
he
has
hardly
eaten
they
say
a
day
ration
since
he
left
hut
point
and
he
work
on
nothing
it
is
now
with
a
slight
southerly
wind
miles
south
of
one
we
have
found
them
to
say
it
has
been
a
ghastly
day
can
not
express
it
it
is
too
bad
for
words
the
tent
was
there
about
to
the
west
of
our
course
and
close
to
a
cairn
of
last
year
it
was
covered
with
snow
and
looked
just
like
a
cairn
only
an
extra
gathering
of
snow
showing
where
the
ventilator
was
and
so
we
found
the
door
it
was
drifted
up
some
feet
to
windward
just
by
the
side
two
pairs
of
ski
sticks
or
the
topmost
half
of
them
appeared
over
the
snow
and
a
bamboo
which
proved
to
be
the
mast
of
the
sledge
their
story
i
am
not
going
to
try
and
put
down
they
got
to
this
point
on
march
and
on
the
all
was
over
nor
will
i
try
and
put
down
what
there
was
in
that
tent
scott
lay
in
the
centre
bill
on
his
left
with
his
head
towards
the
door
and
birdie
on
his
right
lying
with
his
feet
towards
the
door
bill
especially
had
died
very
quietly
with
his
hands
folded
over
his
chest
birdie
also
quietly
oates
death
was
a
very
fine
one
we
go
on
to
try
and
find
his
body
he
was
glad
that
his
regiment
would
be
proud
of
him
they
reached
the
pole
a
month
after
amundsen
we
have
everything
records
diaries
etc
they
have
among
other
things
several
rolls
of
photographs
a
meteorological
log
kept
up
to
march
and
considering
all
things
a
great
many
geological
specimens
they
have
stuck
to
it
is
magnificent
that
men
in
such
case
should
go
on
pulling
everything
that
they
have
died
to
gain
i
think
they
realized
their
coming
end
a
long
time
before
by
scott
head
was
tobacco
there
is
also
a
bag
of
tea
atkinson
gathered
every
one
together
and
read
to
them
the
account
of
oates
death
given
in
scott
diary
scott
expressly
states
that
he
wished
it
known
his
scott
last
words
are
for
god
sake
take
care
of
our
people
then
atkinson
read
the
lesson
from
the
burial
service
from
corinthians
perhaps
it
has
never
been
read
in
a
more
magnificent
cathedral
and
under
more
impressive
circumstances
for
it
is
a
grave
which
kings
must
envy
then
some
prayers
from
the
burial
service
and
there
with
the
under
them
and
the
tent
above
we
buried
them
in
their
and
surely
their
work
has
not
been
in
vain
that
scene
can
never
leave
my
memory
we
with
the
dogs
had
seen
wright
turn
away
from
the
course
by
himself
and
the
mule
party
swerve
ahead
of
us
he
had
seen
what
he
thought
was
a
cairn
and
then
something
looking
black
by
its
side
a
vague
kind
of
wonder
gradually
gave
way
to
a
real
alarm
we
came
up
to
them
all
halted
wright
came
across
to
us
is
the
tent
i
do
not
know
how
he
knew
just
a
waste
of
snow
to
our
right
the
remains
of
one
of
last
year
cairns
a
mere
mound
and
then
three
feet
of
bamboo
sticking
quite
alone
out
of
the
snow
and
then
another
mound
of
snow
perhaps
a
trifle
more
pointed
we
walked
up
to
it
i
do
not
think
we
quite
realized
not
for
very
long
but
some
one
reached
up
to
a
projection
of
snow
and
brushed
it
away
the
green
flap
of
the
ventilator
of
the
tent
appeared
and
we
knew
that
the
door
was
below
two
of
us
entered
through
the
funnel
of
the
outer
tent
and
through
the
bamboos
on
which
was
stretched
the
lining
of
the
inner
tent
there
was
some
snow
not
much
between
the
two
linings
but
inside
we
could
see
nothing
the
snow
had
drifted
out
the
light
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
dig
the
tent
out
soon
we
could
see
the
outlines
there
were
three
men
here
bowers
and
wilson
were
sleeping
in
their
bags
scott
had
thrown
back
the
flaps
of
his
bag
at
the
end
his
left
hand
was
stretched
over
wilson
his
lifelong
friend
beneath
the
head
of
his
bag
between
the
bag
and
the
was
the
green
wallet
in
which
he
carried
his
diary
the
brown
books
of
diary
were
inside
and
on
the
were
some
letters
everything
was
tidy
the
tent
had
been
pitched
as
well
as
ever
with
the
door
facing
down
the
sastrugi
the
bamboos
with
a
good
spread
the
tent
itself
taut
and
shipshape
there
was
no
snow
inside
the
inner
lining
there
were
some
loose
pannikins
from
the
cooker
the
ordinary
tent
gear
the
personal
belongings
and
a
few
more
letters
and
records
personal
and
scientific
near
scott
was
a
lamp
formed
from
a
tin
and
some
lamp
wick
off
a
finnesko
it
had
been
used
to
burn
the
little
methylated
spirit
which
remained
i
think
that
scott
had
used
it
to
help
him
to
write
up
to
the
end
i
feel
sure
that
he
had
died
last
and
once
i
had
thought
that
he
would
not
go
so
far
as
some
of
the
others
we
never
realized
how
strong
that
man
was
mentally
and
physically
until
now
we
sorted
out
the

finnesko
socks
a
flag
there
was
even
a
book
which
i
had
lent
bill
for
the
journey
and
he
had
brought
it
back
somehow
we
learnt
that
amundsen
had
been
to
the
pole
and
that
they
too
had
been
to
the
pole
and
both
items
of
news
seemed
to
be
of
no
importance
whatever
there
was
a
letter
there
from
amundsen
to
king
haakon
there
were
the
personal
chatty
little
notes
we
had
left
for
them
on
the
beardmore
how
much
more
important
to
us
than
all
the
royal
letters
in
the
world
we
dug
down
the
bamboo
which
had
brought
us
to
this
place
it
led
to
the
sledge
many
feet
down
and
had
been
rigged
there
as
a
mast
and
on
the
sledge
were
some
more
odds
and
ends
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
biscuit
box
bowers
meteorological
log
and
the
geological
specimens
thirty
pounds
of
them
all
of
the
first
importance
drifted
over
also
were
the
harnesses
ski
and
hour
after
hour
so
it
seemed
to
me
atkinson
sat
in
our
tent
and
read
the
finder
was
to
read
the
diary
and
then
it
was
to
be
brought
home
these
were
scott
instructions
written
on
the
cover
but
atkinson
said
he
was
only
going
to
read
sufficient
to
know
what
had
happened
and
after
that
they
were
brought
home
unopened
and
unread
when
he
had
the
outline
we
all
gathered
together
and
he
read
to
us
the
message
to
the
public
and
the
account
of
oates
death
which
scott
had
expressly
wished
to
be
known
we
never
moved
them
we
took
the
bamboos
of
the
tent
away
and
the
tent
itself
covered
them
and
over
them
we
built
the
cairn
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
were
there
but
when
all
was
finished
and
the
chapter
of
corinthians
had
been
read
it
was
midnight
of
some
day
the
sun
was
dipping
low
above
the
pole
the
barrier
was
almost
in
shadow
and
the
sky
was
blazing
sheets
and
sheets
of
iridescent
clouds
the
cairn
and
cross
stood
dark
against
a
glory
of
burnished
gold
of
note
left
at
the
cairn
over
the
lat
this
cross
and
cairn
are
erected
over
the
bodies
of
capt
scott
wilson
cantab
bowers
royal
indian
marines
a
slight
token
to
perpetuate
their
gallant
and
successful
attempt
to
reach
the
pole
this
they
did
on
the
january
after
the
norwegian
expedition
had
already
done
so
inclement
weather
and
lack
of
fuel
was
the
cause
of
their
death
also
to
commemorate
their
two
gallant
comrades
capt
oates
of
the
inniskilling
dragoons
who
walked
to
his
death
in
a
blizzard
to
save
his
comrades
about
miles
south
of
this
position
also
of
seaman
edgar
evans
who
died
at
the
foot
of
the
beardmore
glacier
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
taketh
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
relief
expedition
signed
by
all
members
of
the
party
my
diary
goes
on
november
i
can
not
think
that
anything
which
could
be
done
to
give
these
three
great
men
for
great
they
were
a
fitting
grave
has
been
left
undone
a
great
cairn
has
been
built
over
them
a
mark
which
must
last
for
many
years
that
we
can
make
anything
that
will
be
permanent
on
this
barrier
is
impossible
but
as
far
as
a
lasting
mark
can
be
made
it
has
been
done
on
this
a
cross
has
been
fixed
made
out
of
ski
on
either
side
are
the
two
sledges
fixed
upright
and
dug
in
the
whole
is
very
simple
and
most
impressive
on
a
bamboo
standing
by
itself
is
left
the
record
which
i
have
copied
into
this
book
and
which
has
been
signed
by
us
all
we
shall
leave
some
provisions
here
and
go
on
lightly
laden
to
see
if
we
can
find
titus
oates
body
and
so
give
it
what
burial
we
can
we
start
in
about
an
hour
and
i
for
one
shall
be
glad
to
leave
this
place
i
am
very
very
sorry
that
this
question
of
the
shortage
of
oil
has
arisen
we
in
the
first
return
party
were
most
careful
with
our
measurement
having
a
ruler
of
wright
and
a
piece
of
bamboo
with
which
we
did
it
measuring
the
total
height
of
oil
in
each
case
and
then
dividing
up
the
stick
accordingly
with
the
ruler
and
we
were
careful
to
take
little
less
than
we
were
entitled
which
was
stated
to
me
and
stated
by
birdie
in
his
depôt
notes
to
be
of
everything
in
the
depôt
how
the
shortage
arose
is
a
mystery
and
they
eleven
miles
from
one
ton
and
plenty
titus
did
not
show
his
foot
till
about
three
days
before
he
died
the
foot
was
then
a
great
size
and
almost
every
night
it
would
be
again
then
the
last
day
at
lunch
he
said
he
could
go
on
no
more
but
they
said
he
must
he
wanted
them
to
leave
him
behind
in
his
bag
that
night
he
turned
in
hoping
never
to
wake
but
he
woke
and
then
he
asked
their
advice
they
said
they
must
all
go
on
together
a
thick
blizzard
was
blowing
and
he
said
after
a
bit
well
i
am
just
going
outside
and
i
may
be
some
time
they
searched
for
him
but
could
not
find
him
they
had
a
terrible
time
from
on
to
their
last
camp
there
bill
was
very
bad
and
birdie
and
the
owner
had
to
do
the
camping
and
then
eleven
miles
from
plenty
they
had
days
of
blizzard
and
that
was
the
they
had
a
good
spread
on
their
tent
and
their
were
standing
but
their
ski
were
drifted
up
on
the
ground
the
tent
was
in
excellent
condition
only
down
some
of
the
poles
there
were
some
chafes
they
had
been
trying
a
spirit
lamp
when
all
the
oil
was
gone
at
or
so
they
were
getting
temperatures
from
to
at
feet
lower
it
was
regularly
down
to
in
the
and
during
the
day
for
no
explainable
reason
bill
and
birdie
feet
got
bad
the
owner
feet
got
bad
last
it
is
all
too
horrible
i
am
almost
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
now
early
we
came
on
just
under
seven
miles
with
a
very
cold
moist
wind
hurting
our
faces
all
the
way
we
have
left
most
of
the
provisions
to
pick
up
again
we
purpose
going
on
thirteen
miles
and
search
for
oates
body
and
then
turn
back
and
get
the
provisions
back
to
hut
point
and
see
what
can
be
done
over
in
the
west
to
get
up
that
coast
we
hope
to
get
two
mules
back
to
hut
point
if
possible
we
want
to
communicate
with
cape
evans
atkinson
has
been
quite
splendid
in
this
very
trying
time
early
it
has
been
a
miserable
march
we
had
to
wait
some
time
after
hoosh
to
let
the
mules
get
ahead
then
we
went
on
in
a
cold
raw
fog
and
some
head
wind
with
constant
the
surface
has
been
very
bad
all
day
for
the
thirteen
miles
if
we
had
been
walking
in
arrowroot
it
would
have
been
much
like
this
was
at
lunch
the
temperature
was
then
on
when
it
was
drifting
with
the
wind
in
our
faces
and
in
a
bad
light
what
we
took
to
be
the
mule
party
ahead
proved
to
be
the
old
pony
walls
miles
from
one
ton
there
was
here
a
bit
of
sacking
on
the
cairn
and
oates
bag
inside
the
bag
was
the
theodolite
and
his
finnesko
and
socks
one
of
the
finnesko
was
slit
down
the
front
as
far
as
the
leather
beckets
evidently
to
get
his
bad
foot
into
it
this
was
fifteen
miles
from
the
last
camp
and
i
suppose
they
had
brought
on
his
bag
for
three
or
four
miles
in
case
they
might
find
him
still
alive
from
our
last
camp
there
was
a
very
large
and
quite
unmistakable
undulation
to
of
a
mile
from
crest
to
crest
the
pony
walls
behind
us
disappeared
almost
as
soon
as
we
started
to
go
down
and
reappeared
again
on
the
other
side
there
were
i
feel
sure
other
rolls
but
this
was
the
largest
we
have
seen
no
sign
of
oates
body
about
half
an
hour
ago
it
started
to
blow
a
blizzard
and
it
is
now
thick
but
the
wind
is
not
strong
the
mules
which
came
along
well
considering
the
surface
are
off
their
feed
and
this
may
be
the
reason
dimitri
saw
the
cairn
with
the
cross
more
than
eight
miles
away
this
morning
and
in
a
good
light
it
would
be
seen
from
much
farther
off
early
we
built
a
cairn
to
mark
the
spot
near
which
oates
walked
out
to
his
death
and
we
placed
a
cross
on
it
lashed
to
the
cross
is
a
record
as
follows
hereabouts
died
a
very
gallant
gentleman
captain
oates
of
the
inniskilling
dragoons
in
march
returning
from
the
pole
he
walked
willingly
to
his
death
in
a
blizzard
to
try
and
save
his
comrades
beset
by
hardship
this
note
is
left
by
the
relief
expedition
this
was
signed
by
atkinson
and
myself
we
saw
the
cairn
for
a
long
way
in
a
bad
light
as
we
came
back
the
original
plan
with
which
we
started
from
cape
evans
was
if
the
party
was
found
where
we
could
still
bear
out
sufficiently
to
the
eastward
to
have
a
good
chance
of
missing
the
pressure
caused
by
the
beardmore
to
go
on
and
do
what
we
could
to
survey
the
land
south
of
the
beardmore
for
this
was
the
original
plan
of
captain
scott
for
this
year
sledging
but
as
things
are
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
much
doubt
that
we
are
doing
right
in
losing
no
time
in
going
over
to
the
west
of
mcmurdo
sound
to
see
whether
we
can
go
up
to
evans
coves
and
help
campbell
and
his
party
we
brought
on
oates
bag
the
theodolite
was
inside
a
thickish
blizzard
blew
all
day
yesterday
but
it
was
clear
and
there
was
only
surface
drift
when
we
turned
out
for
the
night
march
then
again
as
we
came
along
the
sky
became
overcast
all
except
over
the
land
which
remains
clear
these
nights
when
everything
else
is
obscured
we
noticed
the
same
thing
last
year
now
the
wind
which
had
largely
dropped
has
started
again
and
it
is
drifting
we
have
had
wind
and
drift
on
four
out
of
the
last
five
days
early
when
we
were
ready
to
start
with
the
dogs
it
was
blowing
a
thick
blizzard
but
the
mules
had
already
started
some
time
when
it
was
not
thick
we
had
to
wait
until
nearly
before
we
could
start
and
came
along
following
tracks
it
is
very
warm
and
the
surface
is
covered
with
loose
snow
but
the
slide
in
it
seems
good
we
found
the
mules
here
at
the
cairn
and
cross
having
been
able
to
find
their
way
partly
by
the
old
tracks
i
have
been
trying
to
draw
the
grave
of
all
the
fine
monuments
in
the
world
none
seems
to
me
more
fitting
and
it
is
also
most
impressive
early
i
think
we
are
all
going
crazy
together
at
any
rate
things
are
pretty
difficult
the
latest
scheme
is
to
try
and
find
a
way
over
the
plateau
to
evans
coves
trying
to
strike
the
top
of
a
glacier
and
go
down
it
there
can
be
no
good
in
it
if
ever
men
did
it
they
would
arrive
about
the
time
the
ship
arrived
there
too
and
their
labour
would
be
in
vain
if
they
got
there
and
the
ship
did
not
arrive
there
is
another
party
stranded
they
would
have
to
wait
till
february
or
to
see
if
the
ship
was
coming
and
then
there
would
be
no
travelling
back
over
the
plateau
even
if
we
could
do
it
those
men
there
could
not
it
was
almost
oppressively
hot
yesterday
but
i
never
grumble
about
heat
again
it
has
now
cleared
a
lot
and
we
came
along
on
the
cairns
easily
but
on
a
very
soft
downy
surface
and
the
travelling
has
not
been
fast
we
bring
with
us
the
southern
party
gear
the
sledge
which
was
the
which
they
brought
on
from
the
bottom
of
the
glacier
has
been
left
early
i
am
thankful
to
say
that
the
plateau
journey
idea
has
been
given
up
once
more
we
have
come
along
in
thick
snowy
weather
if
we
had
not
men
on
ski
to
steer
we
could
never
keep
much
of
a
course
but
wright
is
steering
us
very
straight
keeping
a
check
on
the
course
by
watching
the
man
behind
and
so
far
we
have
been
picking
up
all
the
cairns
this
morning
we
passed
the
pony
walls
made
on
november
and
yet
they
were
nearly
level
with
the
ground
so
they
are
not
much
of
a
mark
yank
has
just
had
a
disagreement
with
kusoi
for
kusoi
objected
to
his
trying
to
get
at
the
meat
on
the
sledge
the
mules
have
been
sinking
in
a
long
way
and
are
marching
very
slowly
pyaree
eats
the
after
meals
rani
and
abdullah
divide
a
rope
between
them
at
the
halts
and
they
have
eaten
the
best
part
of
a
trace
since
our
last
camp
these
animals
eat
anything
but
their
proper
food
and
this
some
of
them
will
hardly
touch
it
cleared
a
bit
for
our
second
march
and
we
have
done
our
miles
but
it
was
very
slow
travelling
now
it
is
drifting
as
much
as
ever
yank
that
redoubtable
puller
has
just
eaten
himself
loose
for
the
third
time
since
hoosh
this
time
i
had
to
go
down
to
the
pony
walls
to
get
him
we
have
had
onions
for
the
first
time
in
our
hoosh
they
are
most
excellent
also
we
have
been
having
some
nestlé
condensed
milk
from
one
ton
depôt
which
i
do
not
want
to
see
again
the
depôt
i
mean
peary
must
know
what
he
is
about
taking
milk
as
a
ration
the
sweetness
is
a
great
thing
but
it
would
be
heavy
we
have
been
having
it
with
temperature
down
to
when
it
was
quite
manageable
but
i
do
know
what
it
would
be
like
in
colder
temperatures
early
we
have
done
our
miles
and
have
got
on
to
a
much
better
surface
by
what
we
and
others
have
seen
before
it
seems
that
last
winter
must
have
generally
been
an
exceptional
one
there
have
been
many
parties
out
here
we
have
never
before
seen
this
surface
on
which
it
is
often
too
slippery
to
walk
comfortably
i
do
not
know
what
temperatures
the
discovery
had
in
april
but
it
was
much
colder
last
april
than
it
was
the
year
before
and
then
nothing
had
been
experienced
down
here
to
compare
with
the
winds
last
winter
there
was
a
high
wind
and
a
lot
of
drift
yesterday
during
the
day
and
now
it
is
blowing
and
drifting
as
usual
during
the
last
nine
days
there
has
only
been
one
the
day
we
found
the
tent
when
it
has
not
been
drifting
during
all
or
part
of
the
day
it
is
all
right
for
travelling
north
but
we
should
be
having
very
uncomfortable
marches
if
we
were
marching
the
other
way
early
we
have
seemed
to
be
walking
in
circles
through
space
wright
by
dint
of
having
a
man
behind
to
give
him
a
fixed
point
to
steer
upon
has
steered
us
quite
straight
and
we
have
picked
up
every
cairn
the
pony
party
camped
for
lunch
by
two
cairns
but
they
never
knew
the
two
cairns
were
there
until
a
piece
of
paper
blew
away
and
had
to
be
fetched
and
it
was
caught
against
one
of
the
cairns
they
left
a
flag
there
to
guide
us
and
though
we
saw
and
brought
along
the
flag
we
never
saw
the
cairns
the
temperature
is
and
it
is
now
blowing
a
full
blizzard
all
this
snow
has
hitherto
been
lying
on
the
ground
and
making
a
very
soft
surface
for
though
the
wind
has
always
been
blowing
it
has
never
been
very
strong
this
snow
and
wind
which
have
now
persisted
for
nine
out
of
the
last
ten
days
make
most
dispiriting
marches
for
there
is
nothing
to
see
and
finding
tracks
or
steering
is
a
constant
strain
we
are
certainly
lucky
to
have
been
able
to
march
as
we
have
on
the
most
ardent
admirer
of
mules
could
not
say
that
they
were
a
success
the
question
is
whether
they
might
be
made
so
there
was
really
only
one
thing
against
them
but
that
is
a
very
important
one
they
would
not
eat
on
the
barrier
from
the
time
they
went
away
to
the
day
they
returned
those
that
did
return
poor
things
they
starved
themselves
and
yet
they
pulled
biggish
loads
for
days
if
they
would
have
eaten
they
would
have
been
a
huge
success
they
travelled
faster
than
the
ponies
and
with
one
exception
kept
together
better
than
the
ponies
if
both
were
eating
their
ration
it
is
questionable
whether
a
good
mule
or
a
good
pony
is
to
be
preferred
our
mules
were
of
the
best
and
they
were
beautifully
trained
and
equipped
by
the
indian
government
yet
on
november
a
fortnight
from
the
start
wright
records
mules
are
a
poor
substitute
for
ponies
not
many
will
see
hut
point
again
i
think
doubt
if
any
would
have
got
much
farther
than
this
if
surfaces
had
been
as
bad
this
year
as
last
though
they
would
not
eat
oats
compressed
fodder
and
they
were
quite
willing
to
eat
all
kinds
of
other
things
if
we
could
have
arrived
at
the
mule
equivalent
to
a
vegetarian
diet
they
might
have
pulled
to
the
beardmore
without
stopping
the
nearest
to
this
diet
at
which
we
could
arrive
was
saennegrass
tobacco
ash
and
rope
all
of
which
were
eaten
with
gusto
but
supplies
were
very
limited
they
ate
as
long
as
they
thought
we
were
not
looking
but
as
soon
as
they
realized
they
were
meant
to
eat
it
they
went
on
again
but
during
halts
at
cairns
rani
and
pyaree
would
stand
solemnly
chewing
the
same
piece
of
rope
from
different
ends
abdullah
always
led
the
line
and
followed
wright
ski
tracks
faithfully
so
that
if
another
man
was
ahead
and
wright
turned
aside
abdullah
always
turned
too
it
was
quite
a
manoeuvre
for
wright
to
read
the
at
the
back
of
the
sledge
as
for
begum
got
begum
out
of
a
soft
patch
by
rolling
her
over
on
the
whole
the
mules
failed
to
adapt
themselves
to
this
life
and
as
such
must
at
present
be
considered
to
be
a
failure
for
antarctic
work
certainly
those
of
our
ponies
which
had
the
best
chance
to
adapt
themselves
went
farthest
such
as
nobby
and
jimmy
pigg
both
of
whom
had
experience
of
barrier
sledging
before
they
started
on
the
polar
journey
early
it
has
cleared
at
last
the
disturbance
rolling
away
to
the
east
during
our
first
march
the
surface
was
very
bad
and
the
mules
were
not
going
well
at
this
time
last
year
many
of
the
ponies
were
still
quite
difficult
to
make
stand
just
before
starting
but
these
mules
start
off
now
most
dolefully
i
am
afraid
they
will
not
all
get
back
to
hut
point
two
and
a
half
miles
after
lunch
just
over
forty
miles
from
the
depôt
we
turned
out
to
the
eastward
and
found
the
gear
left
by
the
second
return
party
when
evans
was
so
ill
the
theodolite
which
belonged
to
evans
is
i
believe
there
but
though
we
dug
all
round
we
were
unable
to
find
it
the
ski
were
all
upright
drifted
to
within
six
inches
of
the
shoes
most
of
the
gear
was
clothing
which
we
have
left
with
the
skis
in
the
tank
we
brought
on
a
roll
of
birdie
photographs
taken
on
the
plateau
and
three
geological
specimens
rocks
i
think
this
was
all
of
importance
that
there
was
there
the
n
ration
which
we
have
now
come
to
consists
of
about
oz
of
food
at
present
doing
the
work
we
are
doing
and
with
these
high
temperatures
when
we
started
for
instance
and
now
the
men
do
not
want
it
for
what
it
was
intended
for
hard
it
would
probably
be
an
excellent
ration
and
very
satisfying
early
we
could
not
have
had
a
more
perfect
night
to
march
yesterday
at
holding
the
thermometer
in
the
sun
the
spirit
rose
to
it
was
almost
too
warm
in
the
tent
the
cairns
show
very
plainly
in
such
weather
navigation
of
this
kind
would
be
dead
easy
but
they
are
already
being
eaten
away
and
toppling
the
pony
walls
are
drifted
level
huge
drifts
quite
hard
running
up
to
windward
and
down
to
lee
the
dogs
are
getting
more
hungry
and
want
to
get
at
the
mules
which
makes
them
go
better
they
went
very
well
but
too
fast
once
for
we
had
a
general
bieliglass
under
the
sledge
and
the
rest
all
tangled
up
and
ready
for
a
fight
at
the
first
chance
how
one
of
the
front
pair
of
dogs
got
under
the
sledge
is
a
mystery
among
the
polar
party
gear
is
a
letter
to
the
king
of
norway
it
was
left
by
the
norwegians
for
scott
to
take
back
it
is
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
thin
windcloth
with
one
dark
check
line
in
it
coarser
and
rougher
and
i
should
say
heavier
than
our
mandelbergs
early
we
were
to
make
dimitri
depôt
this
morning
but
we
came
on
in
a
fog
and
the
mule
party
camped
after
running
down
the
distance
wright
came
back
and
said
if
we
have
passed
it
it
over
there
and
as
he
pointed
the
depôt
showed
not
more
than
yards
away
so
that
is
all
right
we
the
dog
party
go
on
in
advance
so
that
no
time
may
be
lost
and
if
the
ice
is
still
good
atkinson
will
get
over
to
cape
evans

early
a
glut
of
in
soft
snow
and
breaking
crusts
we
have
done
between
and
miles
we
saw
no
crevasses
and
have
marked
the
course
well
building
up
the
cairns
and
leaving
two
flags
so
the
mule
party
should
be
all
right
the
dogs
were
going
well
behind
the
ponies
but
directly
we
went
ahead
they
seemed
to
lose
heart
i
think
they
are
tired
of
the
barrier
a
cairn
now
awakens
little
interest
they
know
it
is
only
a
mark
and
it
does
not
mean
a
camp
they
are
all
well
fed
and
fairly
fat
and
in
good
condition
with
a
large
number
of
dogs
i
suppose
one
team
can
go
ahead
when
it
is
going
well
changing
places
with
another
each
keeping
the
others
going
but
i
do
not
think
that
these
dogs
now
will
do
much
more
but
they
have
already
done
as
much
as
any
dogs
of
which
we
have
any
record
the
land
is
clearing
gradually
i
have
never
seen
such
contrasts
of
black
rock
and
white
snow
and
white
island
was
capped
with
great
ranges
of
black
cumulus
over
which
rose
the
pure
white
peaks
of
the
royal
society
range
in
a
blue
sky
the
barrier
itself
was
quite
a
deep
grey
making
a
beautiful
picture
and
now
observation
hill
and
castle
rock
are
in
front
i
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
see
this
view
again
but
it
is
associated
with
many
memories
of
returning
to
home
and
plenty
after
some
long
and
hard
journeys
in
some
ways
i
feel
sorry
but
i
have
seen
it
often
enough
early
we
came
in
miles
with
our
loads
to
find
the
best
possible
news
campbell
party
all
well
are
at
cape
evans
they
arrived
here
on
november
starting
from
evans
coves
on
september
what
a
relief
it
is
and
how
different
things
seem
now
it
is
the
first
real
bit
of
good
news
since
february
last
it
seems
an
age
we
mean
to
get
over
the
if
possible
as
soon
as
we
can
and
then
we
shall
hear
their
story
early
starting
from
hut
point
about
last
evening
we
came
through
by
about
and
sat
up
talking
and
hearing
all
the
splendid
news
till
past
this
morning
all
the
northern
party
look
very
fat
and
fit
and
they
are
most
cheerful
about
the
time
they
have
had
and
make
light
of
all
the
anxious
days
they
must
have
spent
and
their
hard
times
i
can
not
write
all
their
story
when
the
ship
was
battling
with
the
pack
to
try
and
get
in
to
them
they
had
open
water
in
terra
nova
bay
to
the
horizon
as
seen
from
feet
high
they
prepared
for
the
winter
digging
their
hut
into
a
big
snowdrift
a
mile
from
where
they
were
landed
they
thought
that
the
ship
had
been
wrecked
or
that
every
one
had
been
taken
off
from
here
and
that
then
the
ship
had
been
blown
north
by
a
succession
of
furious
gales
which
they
had
and
could
not
get
back
they
never
considered
seriously
the
possibility
of
sledging
down
the
coast
before
the
winter
they
got
settled
in
and
were
very
warm
so
warm
that
in
august
they
did
away
with
one
door
of
which
they
had
three
of
biscuit
boxes
and
sacking
their
stove
was
the
bottom
of
an
oil
tin
and
they
cooked
by
dripping
blubber
on
to
seal
bones
which
became
soaked
with
the
blubber
and
campbell
tells
me
they
cooked
almost
as
quickly
as
a
primus
of
course
they
were
filthy
their
main
difficulty
was
dysentery
and
ptomaine
poisoning
their
stories
of
the
winter
are
most
amusing
of
placing
the
plug
or
sports
in
the
antarctic
of
lectures
of
how
dirty
they
were
of
their
books
of
which
they
had
four
including
david
copperfield
they
had
a
spare
tent
which
was
lucky
for
the
bamboos
of
one
of
theirs
were
blown
in
during
a
big
wind
and
the
men
inside
it
crept
along
the
piedmont
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
igloo
and
slept
two
in
a
bag
how
the
seal
seemed
as
if
they
would
give
out
and
they
were
on
half
rations
and
very
hungry
and
they
were
thinking
they
would
have
to
come
down
in
the
winter
when
they
got
two
seals
of
the
fish
they
got
from
the
stomach
of
a
seal
the
best
feed
they
had
the
blubber
they
have
eaten
but
they
were
buried
deep
in
the
snow
and
quite
warm
big
winds
all
the
time
from
the
cold
winds
off
the
plateau
in
the
igloo
they
could
hear
almost
nothing
outside
how
they
just
had
a
biscuit
a
day
at
times
sugar
on
sundays
etc
and
so
all
is
well
in
this
direction
and
we
have
done
right
in
going
south
and
we
have
at
least
succeeded
in
getting
all
records
i
suppose
any
news
is
better
than
no
news
the
pole
party
photos
of
themselves
at
the
pole
and
at
the
norwegian
cairn
a
norwegian
tent
post
and
two
flags
are
very
good
indeed
one
film
is
unused
one
used
on
these
two
subjects
taken
with
birdie
camera
all
the
party
look
fit
and
well
and
their
clothes
are
not
iced
up
it
was
calm
at
the
time
the
surface
looks
rather
soft
atkinson
and
campbell
have
gone
to
hut
point
with
one
and
we
are
all
to
forgather
here
the
ice
still
seems
good
from
here
to
hut
point
all
else
open
water
as
far
as
can
be
seen
a
steady
southerly
wind
has
been
blowing
here
for
three
days
now
the
mules
should
get
into
hut
point
it
is
the
happiest
day
for
nearly
a
year
almost
the
only
happy
one

scott
returned
from
the

expedition
impressed
by
the
value
of
youth
in
polar
work
but
the
five
who
went
forward
from
were
all
grown
men
chosen
from
a
body
which
was
largely
recruited
on
a
basis
of
youth
four
of
them
were
men
who
were
accustomed
to
take
responsibility
and
to
lead
others
four
of
them
had
wide
sledging
experience
and
were
accustomed
to
cold
temperatures
they
were
none
of
them
likely
to
get
flurried
in
emergency
to
panic
under
any
circumstances
or
to
wear
themselves
out
by
loss
of
nervous
control
scott
and
wilson
were
the
most
highly
strung
of
the
party
i
believe
that
the
anxiety
which
scott
suffered
served
as
a
stimulus
against
mental
monotony
rather
than
as
a
drain
upon
his
energy
scott
was
wilson
evans
oates
and
bowers
years
old
bowers
was
exceptionally
old
for
his
age
in
the
event
of
one
man
crocking
a
party
may
be
better
able
to
cope
with
the
situation
but
with
this
doubtful
exception
scott
had
nothing
to
gain
and
a
good
deal
to
lose
by
taking
an
extra
man
to
the
pole
that
he
did
so
means
i
think
that
he
considered
his
position
a
very
good
one
at
this
time
he
was
anxious
to
take
as
many
men
with
him
as
possible
i
have
an
impression
that
he
wanted
the
army
represented
as
well
as
the
navy
be
that
as
it
may
he
took
five
men
he
decided
to
take
the
extra
man
at
the
last
moment
and
in
doing
so
he
added
one
more
link
to
a
chain
but
he
was
content
and
four
days
after
the
last
return
party
left
them
as
he
lay
out
a
blizzard
quite
warm
in
his
though
the
temperature
was
he
wrote
a
long
diary
praising
his
companions
very
highly
indeed
so
our
five
people
are
perhaps
as
happily
selected
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
he
speaks
of
seaman
evans
as
being
a
giant
worker
with
a
really
remarkable
headpiece
there
is
no
mention
of
the
party
feeling
the
cold
though
they
were
now
at
the
greatest
height
of
their
journey
the
food
satisfied
them
thoroughly
there
is
no
shadow
of
trouble
here
only
evans
has
got
a
nasty
cut
on
his
hand
there
were
more
disadvantages
in
this
party
than
you
might
think
there
was
weeks
food
for
four
men
five
men
would
eat
this
in
about
four
weeks
in
addition
to
the
extra
risk
of
breakdown
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
discomfort
involved
for
everything
was
arranged
for
four
men
as
i
have
already
explained
the
tent
was
a
tent
and
an
inner
lining
had
been
lashed
to
the
bamboos
making
it
smaller
still
when
stretched
out
for
the
night
the
of
the
two
outside
men
must
have
been
partly
off
the
and
probably
on
the
snow
their
bags
must
have
been
touching
the
inner
tent
and
collecting
the
rime
which
was
formed
there
cooking
for
five
took
about
half
an
hour
longer
in
the
day
than
cooking
for
four
half
an
hour
off
your
sleep
or
half
an
hour
off
your
march
i
do
not
believe
that
five
men
on
the
lid
of
a
crevasse
are
as
safe
as
four
wilson
writes
that
the
stow
of
the
sledge
with
five
was
pretty
high
this
makes
it
and
liable
to
capsize
in
rough
country
but
what
would
have
paralysed
anybody
except
bowers
was
the
fact
that
they
had
only
four
pairs
of
ski
between
the
five
of
them
to
slog
along
on
foot
in
soft
snow
in
the
middle
of
four
men
pulling
rhythmically
on
ski
must
have
been
tiring
and
even
painful
and
birdie
legs
were
very
short
no
steady
swing
for
him
and
little
chance
of
getting
his
mind
off
the
job
in
hand
scott
could
never
have
meant
to
take
on
five
men
when
he
told
his
supporting
team
to
leave
their
ski
behind
only
four
days
before
he
reorganized
may
i
be
there
wrote
wilson
of
the
men
chosen
to
travel
the
to
the
pole
about
this
time
next
year
may
i
be
there
or
thereabouts
with
so
many
young
bloods
in
the
heyday
of
youth
and
strength
beyond
my
own
i
feel
there
will
be
a
most
difficult
task
in
making
choice
towards
the
end
i
should
like
to
have
bill
to
hold
my
hand
when
we
get
to
the
pole
said
scott
wilson
there
and
his
diary
is
that
of
an
artist
watching
the
clouds
and
mountains
of
a
scientist
observing
ice
and
rock
and
snow
of
a
doctor
and
above
all
of
a
man
with
good
judgment
you
will
understand
that
the
thing
which
really
interested
him
in
this
journey
was
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
it
is
a
restrained
and
for
the
most
part
a
simple
record
of
facts
there
is
seldom
any
comment
and
when
there
is
you
feel
that
for
this
very
reason
it
carries
more
weight
just
about
this
time
december
very
promising
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
afternoon
march
christmas
day
and
a
real
good
and
happy
one
with
a
very
long
march
january
we
had
only
hours
sleep
last
night
by
a
mistake
but
i
had
mine
solid
in
one
piece
actually
waking
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
i
fell
asleep
in
hours
before
never
moved
january
we
were
surprised
by
seeing
a
skua
gull
flying
over
us
evidently
hungry
but
not
weak
its
droppings
however
were
clear
mucus
nothing
in
them
at
all
it
appeared
in
the
afternoon
and
disappeared
again
about
hour
after
and
then
on
january
last
night
scott
told
us
what
the
plans
were
for
the
south
pole
scott
oates
bowers
petty
officer
evans
and
i
are
to
go
to
the
pole
teddie
evans
is
to
return
from
here
with
crean
and
lashly
scott
finished
his
week
cooking
and
i
begin
mine
just
that
the
next
day
bowers
wrote
i
had
my
farewell
breakfast
in
the
tent
with
teddy
evans
crean
and
lashly
after
so
little
sleep
the
previous
night
i
rather
dreaded
the
march
we
gave
our
various
notes
messages
and
letters
to
the
returning
party
and
started
off
they
accompanied
us
for
about
a
mile
before
returning
to
see
that
all
was
going
well
our
party
were
on
ski
with
the
exception
of
myself
i
first
made
fast
to
the
central
span
but
afterwards
connected
up
to
the
toggle
of
the
sledge
pulling
in
the
centre
between
the
inner
ends
of
captain
scott
and
wilson
traces
this
was
found
to
be
the
best
place
as
i
had
to
go
my
own
step
teddy
and
party
gave
us
three
cheers
and
crean
was
half
in
tears
they
have
a
sledge
to
go
back
with
of
course
and
ought
to
run
down
their
distance
easily
we
found
we
could
manage
our
load
easily
and
did
miles
before
lunch
completing
by
our
marching
hours
are
nine
per
day
it
is
a
long
slog
with
a
sledge
and
more
tiring
for
me
than
the
others
as
i
have
no
ski
however
as
long
as
i
can
do
my
share
all
day
and
keep
fit
it
does
not
matter
much
one
way
or
the
other
we
had
our
first
northerly
wind
on
the
plateau
and
a
deposit
of
snow
crystals
made
the
surface
like
sand
latterly
on
the
march
the
sledge
dragged
like
lead
in
the
evening
it
fell
calm
and
although
the
temperature
was
it
was
positively
pleasant
to
stand
about
outside
the
tent
and
bask
in
the
sun
rays
it
was
our
first
calm
since
we
reached
the
summit
too
our
socks
and
other
damp
articles
which
we
hang
out
to
dry
at
night
become
immediately
covered
with
long
feathery
crystals
exactly
like
plumes
socks
mitts
and
finnesko
dry
splendidly
up
here
during
the
night
we
have
little
trouble
with
them
compared
with
spring
and
winter
journeys
i
generally
spread
my
bag
out
in
the
sun
during
the
hours
of
lunch
time
which
gives
the
reindeer
hair
a
chance
to
get
rid
of
the
damage
done
by
the
deposit
of
breath
and
any
perspiration
during
the
night
plenty
of
sun
heavy
surfaces
iridescent
clouds
the
worst
windcut
sastrugi
i
have
seen
covered
with
bunches
of
crystals
like
gorse
ice
blink
all
round
hairy
faces
and
mouths
dreadfully
iced
up
on
the
march
hot
and
sweaty
days
work
but
sometimes
cold
hands
in
the
loops
of
the
ski
sticks
windy
streaky
cirrus
in
every
direction
all
thin
and
filmy
and
scrappy
horizon
clouds
all
being
wafted
about
these
are
some
of
the
impressions
here
and
there
in
wilson
diary
during
the
first
ten
days
of
the
party
solitary
march
on
the
whole
he
is
enjoying
himself
i
think
you
should
read
scott
diary
yourself
and
form
your
own
opinions
but
i
think
that
after
the
last
return
party
left
him
there
is
a
load
off
his
mind
the
thing
had
worked
so
far
it
was
up
to
now
that
great
mass
of
figures
and
weights
and
averages
those
years
of
preparation
those
months
of
anxiety
no
one
of
them
had
been
in
vain
they
were
up
to
date
in
distance
and
there
was
a
very
good
amount
of
food
probably
more
than
was
necessary
to
see
them
to
the
pole
and
off
the
plateau
on
full
rations
best
thought
of
all
perhaps
the
motors
with
their
uncertainties
the
ponies
with
their
suffering
the
glacier
with
its
possibilities
of
disaster
all
were
behind
and
the
two
main
supporting
parties
were
safely
on
their
way
home
here
with
him
was
a
fine
party
tested
and
strong
and
only
miles
from
the
pole
i
can
see
them
working
with
a
air
with
no
fuss
and
no
unnecessary
talk
each
man
knowing
his
job
and
doing
it
pitching
the
tent
finishing
the
camp
work
and
sitting
round
on
their
while
their
meal
was
cooked
warming
their
hands
on
their
mugs
saving
a
biscuit
to
eat
when
they
woke
in
the
night
packing
the
sledge
with
a
good
neat
stow
marching
with
a
solid
swing
we
have
seen
them
do
it
so
often
and
they
did
it
jolly
well
and
the
conditions
did
not
seem
so
bad
it
is
flat
calm
the
sun
so
warm
that
in
spite
of
the
temperature
we
can
stand
about
outside
in
the
greatest
comfort
it
is
amusing
to
stand
thus
and
remember
the
constant
horrors
of
our
situation
as
they
were
painted
for
us
the
sun
is
melting
the
snow
on
the
ski
etc
the
plateau
is
now
very
flat
but
we
are
still
ascending
slowly
the
sastrugi
are
getting
more
confused
predominant
from
the
i
wonder
what
is
in
store
for
us
at
present
everything
seems
to
be
going
with
extraordinary
smoothness
we
feel
the
cold
very
little
the
great
comfort
of
our
situation
is
the
excellent
drying
effect
of
the
sun
our
food
continues
to
amply
satisfy
what
luck
to
have
hit
on
such
an
excellent
ration
we
really
are
an
excellently
found
party
we
lie
so
very
comfortably
warmly
clothed
in
our
comfortable
bags
within
our
tent
then
something
happened
while
scott
was
writing
the
sentences
you
have
just
read
he
reached
the
summit
of
the
plateau
and
started
ever
so
slightly
to
go
downhill
the
list
of
corrected
altitudes
given
by
simpson
in
his
meteorological
report
are
of
great
interest
cape
evans
shambles
camp
upper
glacier
depôt
three
degree
depôt
one
and
a
half
degree
depôt
south
pole
feet
above
what
happened
is
not
quite
clear
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
surface
became
very
bad
that
the
party
began
to
feel
the
cold
and
that
before
long
evans
especially
began
to
crock
the
immediate
trouble
was
bad
surfaces
i
will
try
and
show
why
these
surfaces
should
have
been
met
in
what
was
you
must
remember
now
a
land
which
no
man
had
travelled
before
scott
laid
his
one
and
a
half
degree
depôt
or
miles
from
the
pole
on
january
that
day
they
started
to
go
down
but
for
several
days
before
that
the
plateau
had
been
pretty
flat
time
after
time
in
the
diaries
you
find
crystals
crystals
crystals
crystals
falling
through
the
air
crystals
bearding
the
sastrugi
crystals
lying
loose
upon
the
snow
sandy
crystals
upon
which
the
sun
shines
and
which
made
pulling
a
terrible
effort
when
the
sky
clouds
over
they
get
along
much
better
the
clouds
form
and
disperse
without
visible
reason
and
generally
the
wind
is
in
their
faces
wright
tells
me
that
there
is
certain
evidence
in
the
records
which
may
explain
these
crystals
halos
are
caused
by
crystals
and
nearly
all
those
logged
from
the
bottom
of
the
beardmore
to
the
pole
and
back
were
on
this
stretch
of
country
where
the
land
was
falling
bowers
mentions
that
the
crystals
did
not
appear
in
all
directions
which
goes
to
show
that
the
air
was
not
always
rising
but
sometimes
was
falling
and
therefore
not
depositing
its
moisture
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
surfaces
met
were
very
variable
and
it
may
be
that
the
snow
lay
in
waves
bowers
mentions
big
undulations
for
thirty
miles
before
the
pole
and
other
inequalities
may
have
been
there
which
were
not
visible
there
is
sometimes
evidence
that
these
crystals
were
formed
on
the
windward
side
of
these
waves
and
carried
over
by
a
strong
wind
and
deposited
on
the
lee
side
it
is
common
knowledge
that
as
you
rise
in
the
atmosphere
so
the
pressure
decreases
in
fact
it
is
usual
to
measure
your
height
by
reading
the
barometer
now
the
air
on
this
last
stretch
to
the
pole
was
rising
for
the
wind
was
from
the
south
and
as
we
have
seen
the
plateau
here
was
sloping
down
towards
the
pole
the
air
driven
uphill
by
this
southerly
wind
was
forced
to
rise
as
it
rose
it
expanded
because
the
pressure
was
less
air
which
has
expanded
without
any
heat
being
given
to
it
from
outside
that
is
in
a
vessel
is
said
to
expand
by
adiabatic
expansion
such
air
tends
first
to
become
saturated
and
then
to
precipitate
its
moisture
these
conditions
were
approximately
fulfilled
on
the
plateau
where
the
air
expanded
as
it
rose
but
could
get
little
or
no
heat
from
outside
the
air
therefore
precipitated
its
moisture
in
the
form
of
crystals
owing
to
the
rapid
changes
in
surfaces
on
one
occasion
they
depôted
their
ski
because
they
were
in
a
sea
of
sastrugi
and
had
to
walk
back
for
them
because
the
snow
became
level
and
soft
again
scott
guessed
that
the
coastal
mountains
could
not
be
far
away
and
we
now
know
that
the
actual
distance
was
only
miles
about
the
same
time
scott
mentions
that
he
had
been
afraid
that
they
were
weakening
in
their
pulling
but
he
was
reassured
by
getting
a
patch
of
good
surface
and
finding
the
sledge
coming
as
easily
as
of
old
on
the
night
of
january
eight
days
after
leaving
the
last
return
party
he
writes
at
camping
every
one
was
chilled
and
we
guessed
a
cold
snap
but
to
our
surprise
the
actual
temperature
was
higher
than
last
night
when
we
could
dawdle
in
the
sun
it
is
most
unaccountable
why
we
should
suddenly
feel
the
cold
in
this
manner
partly
the
exhaustion
of
the
march
but
partly
some
damp
quality
in
the
air
i
think
little
bowers
is
wonderful
in
spite
of
my
protest
he
take
sights
after
we
had
camped
after
marching
in
the
soft
snow
all
day
when
we
have
been
comparatively
restful
on
ski
on
january
wilson
wrote
a
very
cold
grey
thick
day
with
a
persistent
breeze
from
the
which
we
all
felt
considerably
but
temperature
was
only
at
lunch
and
in
the
evening
now
just
over
miles
from
the
pole
scott
wrote
the
same
day
again
we
noticed
the
cold
at
lunch
all
our
feet
were
cold
but
this
was
mainly
due
to
the
bald
state
of
our
finnesko
i
put
some
grease
under
the
bare
skin
and
found
it
make
all
the
difference
oates
seems
to
be
feeling
the
cold
and
fatigue
more
than
the
rest
of
us
but
we
are
all
very
fit
and
on
january
lunch
we
were
all
pretty
done
at
camping
and
wilson
we
made
a
depôt
the
last
depôt
of
provisions
at
lunch
time
and
went
on
for
our
last
lap
with
nine
days
provision
we
went
much
more
easily
in
the
afternoon
and
on
till
the
surface
was
a
funny
mixture
of
smooth
snow
and
sudden
patches
of
sastrugi
and
we
occasionally
appear
to
be
on
a
very
gradual
down
gradient
and
on
a
slope
down
from
the
west
to
east
in
the
light
of
what
happened
afterwards
i
believe
that
the
party
was
not
as
fit
at
this
time
as
might
have
been
expected
ten
days
before
and
that
this
was
partly
the
reason
why
they
felt
the
cold
and
found
the
pulling
so
hard
the
immediate
test
was
the
bad
surface
and
this
was
the
result
of
the
crystals
which
covered
the
ground
simpson
has
worked
out
that
there
is
an
almost
constant
pressure
gradient
driving
the
air
on
the
plateau
northwards
parallel
to
the
meridian
and
parallel
also
to
the
probable
edge
of
the
plateau
the
mean
velocity
for
the
months
of
this
december
and
january
was
about
miles
an
hour
during
this
plateau
journey
scott
logged
wind
force
and
over
on
occasions
and
this
wind
was
in
their
faces
from
the
beardmore
to
the
pole
and
at
their
backs
as
they
returned
a
low
temperature
when
it
is
calm
is
paradise
compared
to
a
higher
temperature
with
a
wind
and
it
is
this
constant
pitiless
wind
combined
with
the
altitude
and
low
temperatures
which
has
made
travelling
on
the
antarctic
plateau
so
difficult
while
the
mean
velocity
of
wind
during
the
two
midsummer
months
seems
to
be
fairly
constant
there
is
a
very
rapid
fall
of
temperature
in
january
the
mean
actual
temperature
found
on
the
plateau
this
year
in
december
was
the
minimum
observed
being
simpson
remarks
that
it
must
be
accounted
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
antarctic
that
it
contains
a
vast
area
of
the
earth
surface
where
the
mean
temperature
during
the
warmest
month
is
more
than
below
the
fahrenheit
zero
and
when
throughout
the
month
the
highest
temperature
was
only
but
the
mean
temperature
on
the
plateau
dropped
in
january
to
the
minimum
observed
being
these
temperatures
have
to
be
combined
with
the
wind
force
described
above
to
imagine
the
conditions
of
the
march
in
the
light
of
scott
previous
plateau
journey
and
shackleton
polar
journey
this
wind
was
always
expected
by
our
advance
parties
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
temperature
falls
as
solar
radiation
decreases
more
rapidly
than
was
generally
supposed
scott
probably
expected
neither
such
a
rapid
fall
of
temperature
nor
the
very
bad
surfaces
though
he
knew
that
the
plateau
would
mean
a
trying
time
and
indeed
it
was
supposed
that
it
would
be
much
the
hardest
part
of
the
journey
on
the
night
of
january
scott
wrote
it
ought
to
be
a
certain
thing
now
and
the
only
appalling
possibility
the
sight
of
the
norwegian
flag
forestalling
ours
they
were
miles
from
the
pole
the
story
of
the
next
three
days
is
taken
from
wilson
diary
we
got
away
at
and
made
miles
by
lunched
and
then
in
miles
came
on
a
black
flag
and
the
norwegians
sledge
ski
and
dog
tracks
running
about
and
both
ways
the
flag
was
of
black
bunting
tied
with
string
to
a
which
had
evidently
been
taken
off
a
sledge
the
age
of
the
tracks
was
hard
to
guess
but
probably
a
couple
of
weeks
or
three
or
more
the
flag
was
fairly
well
frayed
at
the
edges
we
camped
here
and
examined
the
tracks
and
discussed
things
the
surface
was
fairly
good
in
the
forenoon
temperature
and
all
the
afternoon
we
were
coming
downhill
with
again
a
rise
to
the
and
a
fall
and
a
scoop
to
the
east
where
the
norwegians
came
up
evidently
by
another
glacier
illustration
amundsen
polheim
wilson
del
we
camped
on
the
pole
itself
at
this
evening
in
the
morning
we
were
up
at
and
got
away
on
amundsen
tracks
going
for
three
hours
passing
two
small
snow
cairns
and
then
finding
the
tracks
too
much
snowed
up
to
follow
we
made
our
own
for
the
pole
camped
for
lunch
at
and
off
again
from
to
it
blew
from
force
to
all
day
in
our
teeth
with
temperature
the
coldest
march
i
ever
remember
it
was
difficult
to
keep
one
hands
from
freezing
in
double
woollen
and
fur
mitts
oates
evans
and
bowers
all
have
pretty
severe
noses
and
cheeks
and
we
had
to
camp
early
for
lunch
on
account
of
evans
hands
it
was
a
very
bitter
day
sun
was
out
now
and
again
and
observations
taken
at
lunch
and
before
and
after
supper
and
at
night
at
and
at
by
our
time
the
weather
was
not
clear
the
air
was
full
of
crystals
driving
towards
us
as
we
came
south
and
making
the
horizon
grey
and
thick
and
hazy
we
could
see
no
sign
of
cairn
or
flag
and
from
amundsen
direction
of
tracks
this
morning
he
has
probably
hit
a
point
about
miles
off
we
hope
for
clear
weather
but
in
any
case
are
all
agreed
that
he
can
claim
prior
right
to
the
pole
itself
he
has
beaten
us
in
so
far
as
he
made
a
race
of
it
we
have
done
what
we
came
for
all
the
same
and
as
our
programme
was
made
out
from
his
tracks
we
think
there
were
only
men
on
ski
with
plenty
of
dogs
on
rather
low
diet
they
seem
to
have
had
an
oval
tent
we
sleep
one
night
at
the
pole
and
have
had
a
double
hoosh
with
some
last
bits
of
chocolate
and
x
cigarettes
have
been
much
appreciated
by
scott
and
oates
and
evans
a
tiring
day
now
turning
into
a
somewhat
starchy
frozen
bag
we
start
for
home
and
shall
do
our
utmost
to
get
back
in
time
to
send
the
news
to
the
ship
sights
were
taken
in
the
night
and
at
about
we
turned
out
and
marched
from
this
night
camp
about
miles
back
in
a
direction
to
a
spot
which
we
judged
from
last
night
sights
to
be
the
pole
here
we
lunched
camp
built
a
cairn
took
photos
flew
the
queen
mother
union
jack
and
all
our
own
flags
we
call
this
the
pole
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
went
mile
farther
on
in
a
easterly
direction
after
taking
further
sights
to
the
actual
final
spot
and
here
we
left
the
union
jack
flying
during
the
forenoon
we
passed
the
norwegians
last
southerly
camp
they
called
it
polheim
and
left
here
a
small
tent
with
norwegian
and
fram
flags
flying
and
a
considerable
amount
of
gear
in
the
tent
half
reindeer
reinskin
trousers
pair
a
sextant
and
artif
icial
horizon
a
hypsometer
with
all
the
thermoms
broken
etc
i
took
away
the
of
it
which
i
have
wanted
for
sterilizing
and
making
disinfectant
lotions
of
snow
there
were
also
letters
there
one
from
amundsen
to
king
haakon
with
a
request
that
scott
should
send
it
to
him
there
was
also
a
list
of
the
five
men
who
made
up
their
party
but
no
news
as
to
what
they
had
done
i
made
some
sketches
here
but
it
was
blowing
very
cold
birdie
took
some
photos
we
found
no
sledge
there
though
they
said
there
was
one
it
may
have
been
buried
in
drift
the
tent
was
a
funny
little
thing
for
men
pegged
out
with
white
line
and
of
yellow
wood
i
took
some
strips
of
silk
off
the
tent
seams
it
was
perished
the
norskies
had
got
to
the
pole
on
december
and
were
here
from
to
at
our
lunch
south
pole
camp
we
saw
a
with
a
black
flag
about
mile
away
blowing
from
it
scott
sent
me
on
ski
to
fetch
it
and
i
found
a
note
tied
to
it
showing
that
this
was
the
norskies
actual
final
pole
position
i
was
given
the
flag
and
the
note
with
signature
and
i
got
a
piece
of
the
as
well
the
small
chart
of
our
wanderings
shows
best
how
all
these
things
lie
after
lunch
we
made
miles
from
the
pole
camp
to
the
north
again
and
here
we
are
camped
for
the
night
the
following
remarks
on
the
south
pole
area
were
written
by
bowers
in
the
meteorological
log
apparently
on
january
and
within
miles
of
the
south
pole
the
sastrugi
crossed
seem
to
indicate
belts
of
certain
prevalent
winds
these
were
definitely
up
to
about
lat
where
the
summit
was
passed
and
we
started
to
go
definitely
downhill
toward
the
pole
an
indefinite
area
was
then
crossed
and
sastrugi
later
in
about
those
from
the
predominated
at
this
point
also
the
surface
of
the
became
affected
by
undulations
running
more
or
less
at
right
angles
to
our
course
these
resolved
themselves
into
immense
waves
some
miles
in
extent
with
a
uniform
surface
both
in
hollow
and
crust
the
whole
surface
was
carpeted
with
a
deposit
of
which
while
we
were
there
fell
sometimes
in
the
form
of
minute
spicules
and
sometimes
in
plates
these
caused
an
almost
continuous
display
of
parhelia
the
flags
left
a
month
previously
by
the
norwegian
expedition
were
practically
undamaged
and
so
could
not
have
been
exposed
to
very
heavy
wind
during
that
time
their
sledging
and
ski
tracks
where
marked
were
raised
slightly
also
the
dogs
footprints
in
the
neighbourhood
of
their
south
pole
camp
the
drifts
were
but
there
was
one
drift
to
leeward
of
tent
they
had
pitched
their
tent
to
allow
for
wind
for
walking
on
foot
the
ground
was
all
pretty
soft
and
on
digging
down
the
crystalline
structure
of
the
snow
was
found
to
alter
very
little
and
there
were
no
layers
of
crust
such
as
are
found
on
the
barrier
the
snow
seems
so
lightly
put
together
as
not
to
cohere
and
makes
very
little
water
for
its
bulk
when
melted
the
constant
and
varied
motion
of
cirrus
and
the
forming
and
motion
of
radiant
points
shows
that
in
the
upper
atmosphere
at
this
time
of
the
year
there
is
little
or
no
tranquillity
that
is
the
bare
bones
of
what
was
without
any
possible
doubt
a
great
shock
consider
these
men
had
been
out
months
and
were
miles
from
home
the
glacier
had
been
a
heavy
grind
the
plateau
certainly
not
worse
probably
better
than
was
expected
as
far
as
that
place
where
the
last
return
party
left
them
but
then
in
addition
to
a
high
altitude
a
head
wind
and
a
temperature
which
averaged
came
this
shower
of
turning
the
surface
to
sand
especially
when
the
sun
was
out
they
were
living
in
cirrus
clouds
and
the
extraordinary
state
seems
to
have
obtained
that
the
surface
of
the
snow
was
colder
when
the
sun
was
shining
than
when
clouds
checked
the
radiation
from
it
they
began
to
descend
things
began
to
go
not
quite
right
they
felt
the
cold
especially
oates
and
evans
evans
hands
also
were
wrong
ever
since
the
seamen
made
that
new
sledge
the
making
of
that
sledge
must
have
been
fiercely
cold
work
one
of
the
hardest
jobs
they
did
i
am
not
sure
that
enough
notice
has
been
taken
of
that
and
then
the
norwegians
have
forestalled
us
and
are
first
at
the
pole
it
is
a
terrible
disappointment
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
my
loyal
companions
many
thoughts
come
and
much
discussion
have
we
had
we
must
march
on
to
the
pole
and
then
hasten
home
with
all
the
speed
we
can
compass
all
the
must
go
it
will
be
a
wearisome
return
the
pole
yes
but
under
very
different
circumstances
from
those
expected
companions
labouring
on
with
cold
feet
and
hands
evans
had
such
cold
hands
we
camped
for
lunch
the
wind
is
blowing
hard
and
there
is
that
curious
damp
cold
feeling
in
the
air
which
chills
one
to
the
bone
in
no
time
great
god
this
is
an
awful
place
this
is
not
a
cry
of
despair
it
is
an
ejaculation
provoked
by
the
ghastly
facts
even
now
in
january
the
temperature
near
the
south
pole
is
about
lower
than
it
is
during
the
corresponding
month
of
the
year
july
near
the
north
pole
and
if
it
is
like
this
in
what
is
it
like
in
at
the
same
time
it
was
with
the
exception
of
the
sandy
surfaces
what
they
had
looked
for
and
every
detail
of
organization
was
working
out
as
well
as
if
not
better
than
had
been
expected
bowers
was
so
busy
with
the
meteorological
log
and
sights
which
were
taken
in
terribly
difficult
circumstances
that
he
kept
no
diary
until
they
started
back
then
he
wrote
on
seven
consecutive
days
as
follows
a
splendid
clear
morning
with
a
fine
wind
blowing
during
breakfast
time
i
sewed
a
flap
attachment
on
to
the
hood
of
my
green
hat
so
as
to
prevent
the
wind
from
blowing
down
my
neck
on
the
march
we
got
up
the
mast
and
sail
on
the
sledge
and
headed
north
picking
up
amundsen
cairn
and
our
outgoing
tracks
shortly
afterwards
along
these
we
travelled
till
we
struck
the
other
cairn
and
finally
the
black
flag
where
we
had
made
our
outward
camp
we
then
with
much
relief
left
all
traces
of
the
norwegians
behind
us
and
headed
on
our
own
track
till
lunch
camp
when
we
had
covered
eight
miles
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
no
cairn
of
the
british
route
and
fairly
slithered
along
before
a
fresh
breeze
it
was
heavy
travelling
for
me
not
being
on
ski
but
one
does
not
mind
being
tired
if
a
good
march
is
made
we
did
sixteen
miles
altogether
for
the
day
and
so
should
pick
up
our
last
depôt
afternoon
the
weather
became
fairly
thick
soon
after
noon
and
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
there
was
considerable
drift
with
a
mist
caused
by
and
parhelion
good
sailing
breeze
again
this
morning
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
have
one
back
to
the
wind
instead
of
having
to
face
it
it
came
on
thicker
later
but
we
sighted
the
last
depôt
soon
after
and
reached
it
at
the
red
flag
on
the
bamboo
pole
was
blowing
out
merrily
to
welcome
us
back
from
the
pole
with
its
supply
of
necessaries
of
life
below
we
are
absolutely
dependent
upon
our
depôts
to
get
off
the
plateau
alive
and
so
welcome
the
lonely
little
cairns
gladly
at
this
one
called
the
last
depôt
we
picked
up
four
days
food
a
can
of
oil
some
methylated
spirit
for
lighting
purposes
and
some
personal
gear
we
had
left
there
the
bamboo
was
bent
on
to
the
as
a
yard
for
our
sail
instead
of
a
broken
of
amundsen
which
we
had
found
at
the
pole
and
made
a
temporary
yard
of
as
we
had
marched
extra
long
in
the
forenoon
in
order
to
reach
the
depôt
our
afternoon
march
was
shorter
than
usual
the
wind
increased
to
a
moderate
gale
with
heavy
gusts
and
considerable
drift
we
should
have
had
a
bad
time
had
we
been
facing
it
after
an
hour
i
had
to
shift
my
harness
aft
so
as
to
control
the
motions
of
the
sledge
unfortunately
the
surface
got
very
sandy
latterly
but
we
finished
up
with
miles
to
our
credit
and
camped
in
a
stiff
breeze
which
resolved
itself
into
a
blizzard
a
few
hours
later
i
was
glad
we
had
our
depôt
safe
wind
increased
to
force
during
night
with
heavy
drift
in
the
morning
it
was
blizzing
like
blazes
and
marching
was
out
of
the
question
the
wind
would
have
been
of
great
assistance
to
us
but
the
drift
was
so
thick
that
steering
a
course
would
have
been
next
to
impossible
we
decided
to
await
developments
and
get
under
weigh
as
soon
as
it
showed
any
signs
of
clearing
fortunately
it
was
shortlived
and
instead
of
lasting
the
regulation
two
days
it
eased
up
in
the
afternoon
and
found
us
off
with
our
sail
full
it
was
good
running
on
ski
but
soft
plodding
for
me
on
foot
i
shall
be
jolly
glad
to
pick
up
my
dear
old
ski
they
are
nearly
miles
away
yet
however
the
breeze
fell
altogether
latterly
and
i
shifted
up
into
my
old
place
as
middle
number
of
the
five
our
distance
completed
was
miles
when
camp
was
made
again
our
old
cairns
are
of
great
assistance
to
us
also
the
tracks
which
are
obliterated
in
places
by
heavy
drift
and
hard
sastrugi
but
can
be
followed
easily
we
came
across
evans
sheepskin
boots
this
morning
they
were
almost
covered
up
after
their
long
spell
since
they
fell
off
the
sledge
on
january
the
breeze
was
fair
from
the
but
got
lighter
and
lighter
at
lunch
camp
we
had
completed
miles
in
the
afternoon
the
breeze
fell
altogether
and
the
surface
acted
on
by
the
sun
became
perfect
sawdust
the
light
sledge
pulled
by
five
men
came
along
like
a
drag
without
a
particle
of
slide
or
give
we
were
all
glad
to
camp
soon
after
i
think
we
were
all
pretty
tired
out
we
did
altogether
miles
for
the
day
we
are
only
thirty
miles
from
the
degree
depôt
and
should
reach
it
in
two
marches
with
any
luck
the
minimum
temperature
this
night
was
uncorrected
started
off
with
a
bit
of
a
breeze
which
helped
us
a
little
temperature
after
the
first
two
hours
it
increased
to
force
and
filling
the
sail
we
sped
along
merrily
doing
miles
before
lunch
in
the
afternoon
it
was
even
stronger
and
i
had
to
go
back
on
the
sledge
and
act
as
guide
and
brakesman
we
had
to
lower
the
sail
a
bit
but
even
then
she
ran
like
a
bird
we
are
picking
up
our
old
cairns
famously
evans
got
his
nose
not
an
unusual
thing
with
him
but
as
we
were
all
getting
pretty
cold
latterly
we
stopped
at
a
quarter
to
seven
having
done
miles
we
camped
with
considerable
difficulty
owing
to
the
force
of
the
wind
the
same
night
scott
wrote
we
came
along
at
a
great
pace
and
should
have
got
within
an
easy
march
of
our
one
and
a
half
degree
depôt
had
not
wilson
suddenly
discovered
that
evans
nose
was
it
was
white
and
hard
we
thought
it
best
to
camp
at
got
the
tent
up
with
some
difficulty
and
now
pretty
cosy
after
good
hoosh
there
is
no
doubt
evans
is
a
good
deal
run
down
his
fingers
are
badly
blistered
and
his
nose
is
rather
seriously
congested
with
frequent
he
is
very
much
annoyed
with
himself
which
is
not
a
good
sign
i
think
wilson
bowers
and
i
are
as
fit
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
oates
gets
cold
feet
one
way
and
another
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
off
the
summit
the
weather
seems
to
be
breaking
up
bowers
resumes
the
tale
evans
has
got
his
fingers
all
blistered
with
otherwise
we
are
all
well
but
thinning
and
in
spite
of
our
good
rations
get
hungrier
daily
i
sometimes
spend
much
thought
on
the
march
with
plans
for
making
a
pig
of
myself
on
the
first
opportunity
as
that
will
be
after
a
further
march
of
miles
they
are
a
bit
premature
it
was
blowing
a
gale
when
we
started
and
it
increased
in
force
finally
with
the
sail
half
down
one
man
detached
tracking
ahead
and
titus
and
i
breaking
back
we
could
not
always
keep
the
sledge
from
overrunning
the
blizzard
got
worse
and
worse
till
having
done
only
seven
miles
we
had
to
camp
soon
after
twelve
we
had
a
most
difficult
job
camping
and
it
has
been
blowing
like
blazes
all
the
afternoon
i
think
it
is
moderating
now
we
are
only
seven
miles
from
our
depôt
and
this
delay
is
exasperating
scott
wrote
this
is
the
second
full
gale
since
we
left
the
pole
i
do
like
the
look
of
it
is
the
weather
breaking
up
if
so
god
help
us
with
the
tremendous
summit
journey
and
scant
food
wilson
and
bowers
are
my
i
do
like
the
easy
way
in
which
oates
and
evans
get
it
was
no
use
turning
out
at
our
usual
time
as
the
blizzard
was
as
furious
as
ever
we
therefore
decided
on
a
late
breakfast
and
no
lunch
unless
able
to
march
we
have
only
three
food
with
us
and
shall
be
in
queer
street
if
we
miss
the
depôt
our
bags
are
getting
steadily
wetter
so
are
our
clothes
it
shows
a
tendency
to
clear
off
now
breakfast
time
so
we
may
march
after
all
i
am
in
tribulation
as
regards
meals
now
as
we
have
run
out
of
salt
one
of
my
favourite
commodities
it
is
owing
to
atkinson
party
taking
back
an
extra
tin
by
mistake
from
the
upper
glacier
depôt
fortunately
we
have
some
depôted
there
so
i
will
only
have
to
endure
another
two
weeks
without
it
we
have
got
in
a
march
after
all
thank
the
lord
assisted
by
the
wind
we
made
an
excellent
rundown
to
our
one
and
a
half
degree
depôt
where
the
big
red
flag
was
blowing
out
like
fury
with
the
breeze
in
clouds
of
driving
drift
here
we
picked
up
cans
of
oil
and
one
food
for
five
men
together
with
some
personal
gear
depôted
we
left
the
bamboo
and
flag
on
the
cairn
i
was
much
relieved
to
pick
up
the
depôt
now
we
only
have
one
other
source
of
anxiety
on
this
endless
snow
summit
viz
the
three
degree
depôt
in
latitude
in
the
afternoon
we
did
miles
it
was
a
miserable
march
blizzard
all
the
time
and
our
sledge
either
sticking
in
sastrugi
or
overrunning
the
traces
we
had
to
lower
the
sail
half
down
and
titus
and
i
hung
on
to
her
it
was
most
strenuous
work
as
well
as
much
colder
than
pulling
ahead
most
of
the
time
we
had
to
brake
back
with
all
our
strength
to
keep
the
sledge
from
overrunning
bill
got
a
bad
go
of
snow
glare
from
following
the
track
without
goggles
on
this
day
last
year
we
started
the
depôt
journey
i
did
not
think
so
short
a
time
would
turn
me
into
an
old
hand
at
polar
travelling
neither
did
i
imagine
at
the
time
that
i
would
be
returning
from
the
pole
itself
wilson
was
very
subject
to
these
attacks
of
snow
blindness
and
also
to
headaches
before
blizzards
i
have
an
idea
that
his
anxiety
to
sketch
whenever
opportunity
offered
and
his
willingness
to
take
off
his
goggles
to
search
for
tracks
and
cairns
had
something
to
do
with
it
this
attack
was
very
typical
i
wrote
this
at
lunch
and
in
the
evening
had
a
bad
attack
of
snow
blindness
blizzard
in
afternoon
we
only
got
in
a
forenoon
march
could
see
enough
of
the
tracks
to
follow
at
all
my
eyes
did
begin
to
trouble
me
till
yesterday
though
it
was
the
strain
of
tracking
and
the
very
cold
drift
which
we
had
that
gave
me
this
attack
of
snow
glare
marched
on
foot
in
the
afternoon
as
my
eyes
were
too
bad
to
go
on
ski
we
had
a
lot
of
drift
and
wind
and
very
cold
had
and
cocaine
in
my
eyes
at
night
and
did
get
to
sleep
at
all
for
the
pain
dozed
about
an
hour
in
the
morning
only
marched
on
foot
again
all
day
as
i
could
see
my
way
on
ski
at
all
birdie
used
my
ski
eyes
still
very
painful
and
watering
tired
out
by
the
evening
had
a
splendid
night
sleep
and
though
very
painful
across
forehead
they
are
much
better
the
surface
was
awful
in
his
diary
of
the
day
after
they
left
the
pole
january
wilson
wrote
an
account
of
it
we
had
a
splendid
wind
right
behind
us
most
of
the
afternoon
and
went
well
until
about
when
the
sun
came
out
and
we
had
an
awful
grind
until
when
we
camped
the
sun
comes
out
on
sandy
drifts
all
on
the
move
in
the
wind
and
temp
and
gives
us
an
absolutely
awful
surface
with
no
glide
at
all
for
ski
or
sledge
and
just
like
fine
sand
the
weather
all
day
has
been
more
or
less
overcast
with
white
broken
and
for
degrees
above
the
horizon
there
is
a
grey
belt
looking
like
a
blizzard
of
drift
but
this
in
reality
is
caused
by
a
constant
fall
of
minute
snow
crystals
very
minute
sometimes
instead
of
crystal
plates
the
fall
is
of
minute
agglomerate
spicules
like
tiny
the
plates
glitter
in
the
sun
as
though
of
some
size
but
you
can
only
just
see
them
as
on
your
burberry
so
the
spicule
collections
are
only
just
visible
our
hands
are
never
warm
enough
in
camp
to
do
any
neat
work
now
the
weather
is
always
uncomfortably
cold
and
windy
about
but
after
lunch
i
got
a
bit
of
drawing
done
all
the
joy
had
gone
from
their
sledging
they
were
hungry
they
were
cold
the
pulling
was
heavy
and
two
of
them
were
not
fit
as
long
ago
as
january
scott
wrote
that
oates
was
feeling
the
cold
and
fatigue
more
than
the
others
and
again
he
refers
to
the
matter
on
january
on

wilson
wrote

scott
was
getting
alarmed
about
evans

his

are
really
bad
and
to
my
surprise
he
shows
signs
of
losing
heart
over
it
he
has
been
cheerful
since
the
accident
the
party
is
not
improving
in
condition
especially
evans

becoming
rather
dull

diary
quoted
above
finished
on

on
which
day
they
picked
up
their
one
and
a
half
degree
depôt
i
shall
sleep
much
better
with
our
provision
bag
full
again
wrote
scott
that
night
bowers
got
another
rating
sight
it
was
wonderful
how
he
managed
to
observe
in
such
a
horribly
cold
wind
they
marched
miles
the
next
day
but
got
off
the
outward
track
which
was
crooked
on
january
they
did
miles
on
a
very
bad
surface
of
sastrugi
all
day
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
we
began
to
get
out
of
them
by
jove
this
is
tremendous
labour
said
scott
they
were
getting
into
the
better
surfaces
again
miles
for
january
a
fine
day
and
a
good
march
on
very
decent
surface
on
january
bowers
wrote
his
last
full
day
diary
our
record
march
with
a
good
breeze
and
improving
surface
we
were
soon
in
among
the
double
tracks
where
the
supporting
party
left
us
then
we
picked
up
the
memorable
camp
where
i
transferred
to
the
advance
party
how
glad
i
was
to
change
over
the
camp
was
much
drifted
up
and
immense
sastrugi
were
everywhere
in
direction
and
we
did
miles
before
lunch
i
was
breaking
back
on
sledge
and
controlling
it
was
beastly
cold
and
my
hands
were
perished
in
the
afternoon
i
put
on
my
dogskin
mitts
and
was
far
more
comfortable
a
stiff
breeze
with
drift
continues
temperature
thank
god
our
days
of
having
to
face
it
are
over
we
completed
miles
statute
this
evening
and
so
are
only
miles
from
our
precious
three
degree
depôt
it
will
be
bad
luck
indeed
if
we
do
not
get
there
in
a
march
and
a
half
anyhow
nineteen
miles
again
on
january
but
during
the
previous
day
march
wilson
had
strained
a
tendon
in
his
leg
i
got
a
nasty
bruise
on
the
tib
ialis
ant
icus
which
gave
me
great
pain
all
the
afternoon
my
left
leg
exceedingly
painful
all
day
so
i
gave
birdie
my
ski
and
hobbled
alongside
the
sledge
on
foot
the
whole
of
the
tibialis
anticus
is
swollen
and
tight
and
full
of
teno
synovitis
and
the
skin
red
and
oedematous
over
the
shin
but
we
made
a
very
fine
march
with
the
help
of
a
brisk
breeze
january
again
walking
by
the
sledge
with
swollen
leg
but
not
nearly
so
painful
we
had
miles
to
go
to
reach
our
three
degree
depôt
picked
this
up
with
a
week
provision
and
a
line
from
evans
and
then
for
lunch
an
extra
biscuit
each
making
for
lunch
and
whack
of
butter
extra
as
well
afternoon
we
passed
cairn
where
birdie
ski
had
been
left
these
we
picked
up
and
came
on
till
when
the
wind
which
had
been
very
light
all
day
dropped
and
with
temp
it
felt
delightfully
warm
and
sunny
and
clear
we
have
extra
pemmican
in
the
hoosh
now
also
my
leg
pretty
swollen
again
they
travelled
miles
that
day
and
on
the
next
my
leg
much
more
comfortable
gave
me
no
pain
and
i
was
able
to
pull
all
day
holding
on
to
the
sledge
still
some
oedema
we
came
down
a
hundred
feet
or
so
on
a
fairly
steep
gradient
they
were
now
approaching
the
crevassed
surfaces
and
the
which
mark
the
entrance
to
the
beardmore
glacier
and
february
was
marked
by
another
accident
this
time
to
scott
on
a
very
slippery
surface
i
came
an
awful
on
my
shoulder
it
is
horribly
sore
and
another
sick
person
added
to
our
tent
three
out
of
five
injured
and
the
most
troublesome
surfaces
to
come
we
shall
be
lucky
if
we
get
through
without
serious
injury
wilson
leg
is
better
but
might
easily
get
bad
again
and
evans
fingers
we
have
managed
to
get
off
miles
the
extra
food
is
certainly
helping
us
but
we
are
getting
pretty
hungry
the
weather
is
already
a
trifle
warmer
the
altitude
lower
and
only
miles
or
so
to
mount
darwin
it
is
time
we
were
off
the
pray
god
another
four
days
will
see
us
pretty
well
clear
of
it
our
bags
are
getting
very
wet
and
we
ought
to
have
more
sleep
they
had
been
spending
some
time
in
finding
the
old
tracks
but
they
had
a
good
landfall
for
the
depôt
at
the
top
of
the
glacier
and
on
february
they
decided
to
push
on
due
north
and
to
worry
no
more
for
the
present
about
tracks
and
cairns
they
did
miles
that
day
wilson
diary
runs
sunny
and
breezy
again
came
down
a
series
of
slopes
and
finished
the
day
by
going
up
one
enormous
sastrugi
and
drifts
and
shiny
surface
wind
all
at
about
we
got
our
first
sight
again
of
mountain
peaks
on
our
eastern
horizon
we
crossed
the
outmost
line
of
crevassed
ridge
top
the
first
on
our
return
illustration
buckley
island
where
the
fossils
were
found
miles
clear
cloudless
blue
sky
surface
drift
during
forenoon
we
came
down
gradual
descent
including
or
irregular
terrace
slopes
on
crest
of
one
of
which
were
a
good
many
crevasses
southernmost
were
just
big
enough
for
scott
and
evans
to
fall
in
to
their
waists
and
very
deceptively
covered
up
they
ran
east
and
west
those
nearer
the
crest
were
the
ordinary
broad
crevasses
well
lidded
in
the
afternoon
we
again
came
to
a
crest
before
descending
with
street
crevasses
and
one
we
crossed
had
a
huge
hole
where
the
lid
had
fallen
in
big
enough
for
a
horse
and
cart
to
go
down
we
have
a
great
number
of
mountain
tops
on
our
right
and
south
of
our
beam
as
we
go
due
north
now
we
are
now
camped
just
below
a
great
crevassed
mound
on
a
mountain
top
evidently
miles
we
had
a
difficult
day
getting
in
amongst
a
frightful
chaos
of
broad
crevasses
we
kept
too
far
east
and
had
to
wind
in
and
out
amongst
them
and
cross
multitudes
of
bridges
we
then
bore
west
a
bit
and
got
on
better
all
the
afternoon
and
got
round
a
good
deal
of
the
upper
disturbances
of
the
falls
here
scott
wrote
we
are
camped
in
a
very
disturbed
region
but
the
wind
has
fallen
very
light
here
and
our
camp
is
comfortable
for
the
first
time
for
many
weeks
miles
we
again
had
a
forenoon
of
trying
to
cut
corners
got
in
amongst
great
chasms
running
and
and
had
to
come
out
again
we
then
again
kept
west
and
downhill
over
tremendous
sastrugi
with
a
slight
breeze
very
cold
in
afternoon
continued
bearing
more
and
more
towards
mount
darwin
we
got
round
one
of
the
main
lines
of
and
looked
back
up
to
it
very
cold
march
many
crevasses
i
walking
by
the
sledge
on
foot
found
a
good
many
the
others
all
on
ski
miles
clear
day
again
and
we
made
a
tedious
march
in
the
forenoon
along
a
flat
or
two
and
down
a
long
slope
and
then
in
the
afternoon
we
had
a
very
fresh
breeze
and
very
fast
run
down
long
slopes
covered
with
big
sastrugi
it
was
a
strenuous
job
steering
and
checking
behind
by
the
sledge
we
reached
the
upper
glacier
depôt
by
and
found
everything
right
this
was
the
end
of
the
plateau
the
beginning
of
the
glacier
their
hard
time
should
be
over
so
far
as
the
weather
was
concerned
wilson
notes
how
fine
the
land
looked
as
they
approached
it
the
colour
of
the
dominion
range
rock
is
in
the
main
all
brown
madder
or
dark
reddish
chocolate
but
there
are
numerous
bands
of
yellow
rock
scattered
amongst
it
i
think
it
is
composed
of
dolerite
and
sandstone
as
on
the
w
side
the
condition
of
the
party
was
of
course
giving
anxiety
how
much
it
is
impossible
to
say
a
good
deal
was
to
be
hoped
from
the
warm
weather
ahead
scott
and
bowers
were
probably
the
fittest
men
scott
shoulder
soon
mended
and
bowers
is
splendid
full
of
energy
and
bustle
all
the
time
wilson
was
feeling
the
cold
more
than
either
of
them
now
his
leg
was
not
yet
well
enough
to
wear
ski
oates
had
suffered
from
a
cold
foot
for
some
time
evans
however
was
the
only
man
whom
scott
seems
to
have
been
worried
about
his
cuts
and
wounds
suppurate
his
nose
looks
very
bad
and
altogether
he
shows
considerable
signs
of
being
played
out
well
we
have
come
through
our
seven
weeks
journey
and
most
of
us
are
fit
but
i
think
another
week
might
have
had
a
very
bad
effect
on
evans
who
is
going
steadily
downhill
they
had
all
been
having
extra
food
which
had
helped
them
much
though
they
complained
of
hunger
and
want
of
sleep
directly
they
got
into
the
warmer
weather
on
the
glacier
their
food
satisfied
them
but
we
must
march
to
keep
on
the
full
ration
and
we
want
rest
yet
we
shall
pull
through
all
right
we
are
by
no
means
worn
out
there
are
no
germs
in
the
antarctic
save
for
a
few
isolated
specimens
which
almost
certainly
come
down
from
civilization
in
the
upper
air
currents
you
can
sleep
all
night
in
a
wet
bag
and
clothing
and
sledge
all
day
in
a
mail
of
ice
and
you
will
not
catch
a
cold
nor
get
any
aches
you
can
get
deficiency
diseases
like
scurvy
for
inland
this
is
a
deficiency
country
without
vitamines
you
can
also
get
poisoned
if
you
allow
your
food
to
remain
thawed
out
too
long
and
if
you
do
not
cover
the
provisions
in
a
depôt
with
enough
snow
the
sun
will
get
at
them
even
though
the
air
temperature
is
far
below
freezing
but
it
is
not
easy
to
become
diseased
on
the
other
hand
once
something
does
go
wrong
it
is
the
deuce
and
all
to
get
it
right
especially
cuts
and
the
isolation
of
the
polar
traveller
may
place
him
in
most
difficult
circumstances
there
are
no
ambulances
and
hospitals
and
a
man
on
a
sledge
is
a
very
serious
weight
practically
any
man
who
undertakes
big
polar
journeys
must
face
the
possibility
of
having
to
commit
suicide
to
save
his
companions
and
the
difficulty
of
this
must
not
be
overrated
for
it
is
in
some
ways
more
desirable
to
die
than
to
live
if
things
are
bad
enough
we
got
to
that
stage
on
the
winter
journey
i
remember
discussing
this
question
with
bowers
who
had
a
scheme
of
doing
himself
in
with
a
if
necessity
arose
though
how
he
could
have
accomplished
it
i
do
know
or
as
he
said
there
might
be
a
crevasse
and
at
any
rate
there
was
the
medical
case
i
was
horrified
at
the
time
i
had
never
faced
the
thing
out
with
myself
like
that
they
left
the
upper
glacier
depôt
under
mount
darwin
on
february
this
day
they
collected
the
most
important
of
those
geological
specimens
to
which
at
wilson
special
request
they
clung
to
the
end
and
which
were
mostly
collected
by
him
mount
darwin
and
buckley
island
which
are
really
the
tops
of
high
mountains
stick
out
of
the
ice
at
the
top
of
the
glacier
and
the
course
ran
near
to
both
of
them
but
not
actually
up
against
them
shackleton
found
coal
on
buckley
island
and
it
was
clear
that
the
place
was
of
great
geological
importance
for
it
was
one
of
the
only
places
in
the
antarctic
where
fossils
could
be
found
so
far
as
we
knew
the
stretched
away
as
far
as
you
could
see
towards
the
mountains
which
bound
the
glacier
on
either
side
and
as
you
looked
upwards
towards
buckley
island
they
were
like
a
long
breaking
wave
one
of
the
great
difficulties
about
the
beardmore
was
that
you
saw
the
as
you
went
up
and
avoided
them
but
coming
down
you
knew
nothing
of
their
whereabouts
until
you
fell
into
the
middle
of
pressure
and
crevasses
and
then
it
was
almost
impossible
to
say
whether
you
should
go
right
or
left
to
get
out
evans
was
unable
to
pull
this
day
and
was
detached
from
the
sledge
but
this
was
not
necessarily
a
very
serious
sign
shackleton
on
his
return
journey
was
not
able
to
pull
at
this
place
wilson
wrote
as
follows
mt
buckley
a
very
busy
day
we
had
a
very
cold
forenoon
march
blowing
like
blazes
from
the
birdie
detached
and
went
on
ski
to
mt
darwin
and
collected
some
dolerite
the
only
rock
he
could
see
on
the
nunatak
which
was
nearest
we
got
into
a
sort
of
crusted
surface
where
the
snow
broke
through
nearly
to
our
knees
and
the
also
i
thought
at
first
we
were
all
on
a
thinly
bridged
crevasse
we
then
came
on
east
a
bit
and
gradually
got
worse
and
worse
going
over
an
having
great
trouble
to
prevent
sledge
taking
charge
but
eventually
got
down
and
then
made
or
into
the
land
and
camped
right
by
the
moraine
under
the
great
sandstone
cliffs
of
mt
buckley
out
of
the
wind
and
quite
warm
again
it
was
a
wonderful
change
after
lunch
we
all
geologized
on
till
supper
and
i
was
very
late
turning
in
examining
the
moraine
after
supper

all
strewn
over
the
rocks

we
made
our
way
along
down
the
moraine
and
at
the
end
of
mt
buckley
i
unhitched
and
had
half
an
hour
over
the
rocks
and
again
got
some
good
things
written
up
in
we
then
left
the
moraine
and
made
a
very
good
march
on
rough
blue
ice
all
day
with
very
small
and
scarce
scraps
of
névé
on
one
of
which
we
camped
for
the
night
with
a
rather
overcast
foggy
sky
which
cleared
to
bright
sun
in
the
night
we
are
all
thoroughly
enjoying
temps
of
or
thereabouts
now
with
no
wind
instead
of
the
summit
winds
which
are
incessant
with
temp
we
made
a
very
good
forenoon
march
from
to
towards
the
cloudmaker
weather
overcast
gradually
obscured
everything
in
snowfall
fog
starting
with
crystals
of
large
size
we
had
to
camp
after
hours
afternoon
march
as
it
got
too
thick
to
see
anything
and
we

limited
collotypers
the
next
day
in
bad
lights
and
on
a
bad
surface
they
fell
into
the
same
pressure
which
both
the
other
returning
parties
experienced
like
them
they
were
in
the
middle
of
it
before
they
realized
then
came
the
fatal
decision
to
steer
east
we
went
on
for
hours
hoping
to
do
a
good
distance
which
i
suppose
we
did
but
for
the
last
hour
or
two
we
pressed
on
into
a
regular
trap
getting
on
to
a
good
surface
we
did
not
reduce
our
lunch
meal
and
thought
all
going
well
but
half
an
hour
after
lunch
we
got
into
the
worst
ice
mess
i
have
ever
been
in
for
three
hours
we
plunged
on
on
ski
first
thinking
we
were
too
much
to
the
right
then
too
much
to
the
left
meanwhile
the
disturbance
got
worse
and
my
spirits
received
a
very
rude
shock
there
were
times
when
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
awful
turmoil
in
which
we
found
ourselves
the
turmoil
changed
in
character
irregular
crevassed
surface
giving
way
to
huge
chasms
closely
packed
and
most
difficult
to
cross
it
was
very
heavy
work
but
we
had
grown
desperate
we
won
through
at
and
i
write
after
hours
on
the
march
wilson
continues
the
story
we
had
a
good
night
just
outside
the
and
disturbances
and
a
small
breakfast
of
tea
thin
hoosh
and
biscuit
and
began
the
forenoon
by
a
decent
bit
of
travelling
on
rubbly
blue
ice
in
crampons
then
plunged
into
an
and
wandered
about
in
it
for
hours
and
hours
we
had
one
biscuit
and
some
tea
after
a
night
sleep
on
very
hard
and
irregular
blue
ice
amongst
the
crevasses
no
snow
on
the
tent
only
ski
etc
got
away
at
and
by
found
the
depôt
having
had
a
good
march
over
very
hard
rough
blue
ice
only
hour
in
the
disturbance
of
yesterday
the
weather
was
very
thick
snowing
and
overcast
could
only
just
see
the
points
of
bearing
for
depôt
however
we
got
there
tired
and
hungry
and
camped
and
had
hoosh
and
tea
and
biscuits
each
then
away
again
with
our
three
and
a
half
days
food
from
this
red
flag
depôt
and
off
down
by
the
cloudmaker
moraine
we
travelled
about
hours
on
hard
blue
ice
and
i
was
allowed
to
geologize
the
last
hour
down
the
two
outer
lines
of
boulders
the
outer
one
all
dolerite
and
quartz
rocks
the
inner
all
dolerite
and
sandstone
we
camped
on
the
inner
line
of
boulders
weather
clearing
all
the
afternoon
meanwhile
both
wilson
and
bowers
had
been
badly
though
wilson
does
not
mention
it
in
his
diary
and
this
night
scott
says
evans
had
no
power
to
assist
with
camping
work
a
good
march
followed
on
february
but
there
is
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
that
we
are
not
pulling
strong
probably
none
of
us
wilson
leg
still
troubles
him
and
he
does
like
to
trust
himself
on
ski
but
the
worst
case
is
evans
who
is
giving
us
serious
anxiety
this
morning
he
suddenly
disclosed
a
huge
blister
on
his
foot
it
delayed
us
on
the
march
when
he
had
to
have
his
crampon
readjusted
sometimes
i
feel
he
is
going
from
bad
to
worse
but
i
trust
he
will
pick
up
again
when
we
come
to
steady
work
on
ski
like
this
afternoon
he
is
hungry
and
so
is
wilson
we
ca
risk
opening
out
our
food
again
and
as
cook
at
present
i
am
serving
something
under
full
allowance
we
are
inclined
to
get
slack
and
slow
with
our
camping
arrangement
and
small
delays
increase
i
have
talked
of
the
matter
and
hope
for
improvement
we
can
not
do
distance
without
the
hours
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
party
more
wrong
i
mean
than
was
justified
by
the
tremendous
journey
they
had
already
experienced
except
for
the
blizzard
at
the
bottom
of
the
beardmore
and
the
surfaces
near
the
pole
it
had
been
little
worse
than
they
expected
evans
however
who
was
considered
by
scott
to
be
the
strongest
man
of
the
party
had
already
collapsed
and
it
is
admitted
that
the
rest
of
the
party
was
becoming
far
from
strong
there
seems
to
be
an
unknown
factor
here
somewhere
illustration

continues
i
got
on
ski
again
first
time
since
damaging
my
leg
and
was
on
them
all
day
for
hours
it
was
a
bit
painful
and
swelled
by
the
evening
and
every
night
i
put
on
snow
poultice
we
are
not
yet
abreast
of
mt
kyffin
and
much
discussion
how
far
we
are
from
the
lower
glacier
depôt
probably
to
and
we
have
to
reduce
food
again
only
one
biscuit
with
a
thin
hoosh
of
pemmican
we
have
to
make
one
day
food
which
remains
last
over
the
two
the
weather
became
heavily
overcast
during
the
afternoon
and
then
began
to
snow
and
though
we
got
in
our
hours
march
it
was
with
difficulty
and
we
only
made
a
bit
over
miles
however
we
are
nearer
the
depôt
got
a
good
start
in
fair
weather
after
one
biscuit
and
a
thin
breakfast
and
made
in
the
forenoon
again
the
weather
became
overcast
and
we
lunched
almost
at
our
old
bearing
on
kyffin
of
lunch
all
the
afternoon
the
weather
became
thick
and
thicker
and
after
hours
evans
collapsed
sick
and
giddy
and
unable
to
walk
even
by
the
sledge
on
ski
so
we
camped
can
see
no
land
at
all
anywhere
but
we
must
be
getting
pretty
near
the
pillar
rock
collapse
has
much
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
has
never
been
sick
in
his
life
and
is
now
helpless
with
his
hands
we
had
thin
meals
for
lunch
and
supper
the
weather
cleared
and
we
got
away
for
a
clear
run
to
the
depôt
and
had
gone
a
good
part
of
the
way
when
evans
found
his
ski
shoes
coming
off
he
was
allowed
to
readjust
and
continue
to
pull
but
it
happened
again
and
then
again
so
he
was
told
to
unhitch
get
them
right
and
follow
on
and
catch
us
up
he
lagged
far
behind
till
lunch
and
when
we
camped
we
had
lunch
and
then
went
back
for
him
as
he
had
not
come
up
he
had
fallen
and
had
his
hands
and
we
then
returned
for
the
sledge
and
brought
it
and
fetched
him
in
on
it
as
he
was
rapidly
losing
the
use
of
his
legs
he
was
comatose
when
we
got
him
into
the
tent
and
he
died
without
recovering
consciousness
that
night
about
we
had
a
short
rest
for
an
hour
or
two
in
our
bags
that
night
then
had
a
meal
and
came
on
through
the
pressure
ridges
about
miles
farther
down
and
reached
our
lower
glacier
depôt
here
we
camped
at
last
had
a
good
meal
and
slept
a
good
night
rest
which
we
badly
needed
our
depôt
was
all
right
a
very
terrible
day
on
discussing
the
symptoms
we
think
he
began
to
get
weaker
just
before
we
reached
the
pole
and
that
his
downward
path
was
accelerated
first
by
the
shock
of
his
fingers
and
later
by
falls
during
rough
travelling
on
the
glacier
further
by
his
loss
of
all
confidence
in
himself
wilson
thinks
it
certain
he
must
have
injured
his
brain
by
a
fall
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
lose
a
companion
in
this
way
but
calm
reflection
shows
that
there
could
not
have
been
a
better
ending
to
the
terrible
anxieties
of
the
past
week
discussion
of
the
situation
at
lunch
yesterday
shows
us
what
a
desperate
pass
we
were
in
with

stevenson
has
written
of
a
traveller
whose
wife
slumbered
by
his
side
what
time
his
spirit
forth
in
memory
of
days
gone
by
he
was
quite
happy
about
it
and
i
suppose
his
travels
had
been
peaceful
for
days
and
nights
such
as
these
men
spent
coming
down
the
beardmore
will
give
you
nightmare
after
nightmare
and
wake
you
shrieking
years
after
of
course
they
were
shaken
and
weakened
but
the
conditions
they
had
faced
and
the
time
they
had
been
out
do
not
in
my
opinion
account
entirely
for
their
weakness
nor
for
evans
collapse
which
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
was
the
biggest
heaviest
and
most
muscular
man
in
the
party
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
life
for
such
men
who
are
expected
to
pull
their
weight
and
to
support
and
drive
a
larger
machine
than
their
companions
and
at
the
same
time
to
eat
no
extra
food
if
as
seems
likely
the
ration
these
men
were
eating
was
not
enough
to
support
the
work
they
were
doing
then
it
is
clear
that
the
heaviest
man
will
feel
the
deficiency
sooner
and
more
severely
than
others
who
are
smaller
than
he
evans
must
have
had
a
most
terrible
time
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
diaries
that
he
had
suffered
very
greatly
without
complaint
at
home
he
would
have
been
nursed
in
bed
here
he
must
march
he
was
pulling
the
day
he
died
until
he
was
crawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
in
the
snow
horrible
most
horrible
perhaps
for
those
who
found
him
so
and
sat
in
the
tent
and
watched
him
die
i
am
told
that
simple
concussion
does
not
kill
as
suddenly
as
this
probably
some
clot
had
moved
in
his
brain
for
one
reason
and
another
they
took
very
nearly
as
long
to
come
down
the
glacier
with
a
featherweight
sledge
as
we
had
taken
to
go
up
it
with
full
loads
seven
days
food
were
allowed
from
the
upper
to
the
lower
glacier
depôt
bowers
told
me
that
he
thought
this
was
running
it
fine
but
the
two
supporting
parties
got
through
all
right
though
they
both
tumbled
into
the
horrible
pressure
above
the
cloudmaker
the
last
return
party
took
days
the
polar
party
days
the
latter
had
been
days
longer
on
the
plateau
than
the
former
owing
to
their
slow
progress
down
the
glacier
the
polar
party
went
on
short
rations
for
the
first
and
last
time
until
they
camped
on
march
with
the
exception
of
these
days
they
had
either
their
full
or
more
than
their
full
ration
until
that
date
until
they
reached
the
barrier
on
their
return
journey
the
weather
can
be
described
neither
as
abnormal
nor
as
unexpected
there
were
statute
miles
geo
to
be
covered
to
one
ton
depôt
and
statute
miles
geo
more
from
one
ton
to
hut
point
they
had
just
picked
up
one
week
food
for
five
men
between
the
beardmore
and
one
ton
were
three
more
depôts
each
with
one
week
food
for
five
men
they
were
four
men
their
way
was
across
the
main
body
of
the
barrier
out
of
sight
of
land
and
away
from
any
immediate
influence
of
the
comparatively
warm
sea
ahead
of
them
nothing
was
known
of
the
weather
conditions
in
the
middle
of
the
barrier
at
this
time
of
year
and
no
one
suspected
that
march
conditions
there
were
very
cold

wilson
diary
continues
we
had
only
five
hours
sleep
we
had
butter
and
biscuit
and
tea
when
we
woke
at
then
came
over
the
gap
entrance
to
the
camp
visiting
a
rock
moraine
of
mt
hope
on
the
way
late
in
getting
away
after
making
up
new
sledge
and
digging
out
pony
meat
we
made
on
a
very
heavy
surface
indeed
this
bad
surface
is
the
feature
of
their
first
homeward
marches
on
the
barrier
from
now
onwards
they
complain
always
of
the
terrible
surfaces
but
a
certain
amount
of
the
heavy
pulling
must
be
ascribed
to
their
own
weakness
in
the
low
temperatures
which
occurred
later
bad
surfaces
were
to
be
expected
but
now
the
temperatures
were
not
really
low
about
zero
to
fine
clear
days
for
the
most
part
and
a
thing
to
be
noticed
little
wind
they
wanted
wind
which
would
probably
be
behind
them
from
the
south
oh
for
a
little
wind
scott
writes
evans
evidently
had
plenty
he
was
already
very
anxious
if
this
goes
on
we
shall
have
a
bad
time
but
i
sincerely
trust
it
is
only
the
result
of
this
windless
area
close
to
the
coast
and
that
as
we
are
making
steadily
outwards
we
shall
shortly
escape
it
it
is
perhaps
premature
to
be
anxious
about
covering
distance
in
all
other
respects
things
are
improving
we
have
our
spread
on
the
sledge
and
they
are
drying
but
above
all
we
have
our
full
measure
of
food
again
we
had
a
sort
of
stew
fry
of
pemmican
and
horseflesh
and
voted
it
the
best
hoosh
we
had
ever
had
on
a
sledge
journey
the
absence
of
poor
evans
is
a
help
to
the
commissariat
but
if
he
had
been
here
in
a
fit
state
we
might
have
got
along
faster
i
wonder
what
is
in
store
for
us
with
some
little
alarm
at
the
lateness
of
the
season
and
on
february
when
they
made
miles
at
present
our
sledge
and
ski
leave
deeply
ploughed
tracks
which
can
be
seen
winding
for
miles
behind
it
is
distressing
but
as
usual
trials
are
forgotten
when
we
camp
and
good
food
is
our
lot
pray
god
we
get
better
travelling
as
we
are
not
so
fit
as
we
were
and
the
season
is
advancing
apace
and
on
february
we
never
won
a
march
of
miles
with
greater
difficulty
but
we
ca
go
on
like
this
a
breeze
suddenly
came
away
from
force
to
at
on
february
and
they
hoisted
the
sail
on
the
sledge
they
had
just
picked
up
they
immediately
lost
the
tracks
they
were
following
and
failed
to
find
the
cairns
and
camp
remains
which
they
should
have
picked
up
if
they
had
been
on
the
right
course
which
was
difficult
here
owing
to
the
thick
weather
we
had
on
the
outward
march
bowers
was
sure
they
were
too
near
the
land
and
they
steered
out
but
still
failed
to
pick
up
the
line
on
which
their
depôts
and
their
lives
depended
scott
was
convinced
they
were
outside
not
inside
the
line
the
next
morning
bowers
took
a
round
of
angles
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion
on
slender
evidence
that
they
were
still
too
near
the
land
they
had
an
unhappy
march
still
off
the
tracks
but
just
as
we
decided
to
lunch
bowers
wonderful
sharp
eyes
detected
an
old
double
lunch
cairn
the
theodolite
telescope
confirmed
it
and
our
spirits
rose
accordingly
then
wilson
had
another
bad
attack
of

hardly
keep
a
chink

wilson
del
they
were
in
evil
case
but
they
would
have
been
all
right
these
men
if
the
cold
had
not
come
down
upon
them
a
bolt
quite
literally
from
the
blue
of
a
clear
sky
unexpected
unforetold
and
fatal
the
cold
itself
was
not
so
tremendous
until
you
realize
that
they
had
been
out
four
months
that
they
had
fought
their
way
up
the
biggest
glacier
in
the
world
in
feet
of
soft
snow
that
they
had
spent
seven
weeks
under
plateau
conditions
of
rarefied
air
big
winds
and
low
temperatures
and
they
had
watched
one
of
their
companions
die
not
in
a
bed
in
a
hospital
or
ambulance
nor
suddenly
but
slowly
night
by
night
and
day
by
day
with
his
hands
and
his
brain
going
until
they
must
have
wondered
each
man
in
his
heart
whether
in
such
case
a
human
being
could
be
left
to
die
that
four
men
might
live
he
died
a
natural
death
and
they
went
out
on
to
the
barrier
given
such
conditions
as
were
expected
and
the
conditions
for
which
preparation
had
been
made
they
would
have
come
home
alive
and
well
some
men
say
the
weather
was
abnormal
there
is
some
evidence
that
it
was
the
fact
remains
that
the
temperature
dropped
into
the
minus
thirties
by
day
and
the
minus
forties
by
night
the
fact
also
remains
that
there
was
a
great
lack
of
southerly
winds
and
in
consequence
the
air
near
the
surface
was
not
being
mixed
excessive
radiation
took
place
and
a
layer
of
cold
air
formed
near
the
ground
crystals
also
formed
on
the
surface
of
the
snow
and
the
wind
was
not
enough
to
sweep
them
away
as
the
temperature
dropped
so
the
surface
for
the
runners
of
the
sledges
became
worse
as
i
explained
elsewhere
they
were
pulling
as
it
were
through
sand
in
the
face
of
the
difficulties
which
beset
them
their
marches
were
magnificent
miles
on
february
and
again
on
the
following
day
miles
on
february
and
miles
again
on
february
and
if
they
could
have
kept
this
up
they
would
have
come
through
without
a
doubt
but
i
think
it
was
about
now
that
they
suspected
and
then
were
sure
that
they
could
not
pull
through
scott
diary

march
is
as
follows
misfortunes
rarely
come
singly
we
marched
to
the
middle
barrier
depôt
fairly
easily
yesterday
afternoon
and
since
that
have
suffered
three
distinct
blows
which
have
placed
us
in
a
bad
position
first
we
found
a
shortage
of
oil
with
most
rigid
economy
it
can
scarce
carry
us
to
the
next
depôt
on
this
surface
miles
away
second
titus
oates
disclosed
his
feet
the
toes
showing
very
bad
indeed
evidently
bitten
by
the
late
temperatures
the
third
blow
came
in
the
night
when
the
wind
which
we
had
hailed
with
some
joy
brought
dark
overcast
weather
it
fell
below
in
the
night
and
this
morning
it
took
hours
to
get
our
on
but
we
got
away
before
eight
we
lost
cairn
and
tracks
together
and
made
as
steady
as
we
could
by
but
have
seen
nothing
worse
was
to
come
the
surface
is
simply
awful
in
spite
of
strong
wind
and
full
sail
we
have
only
done
miles
we
are
in
a
queer
street
since
there
is
no
doubt
we
can
not
do
the
extra
marches
and
feel
the
cold
horribly
they
did
nearly
ten
miles
that
day
but
on
march
they
had
a
terrible
time
god
help
us
wrote
scott
we
ca
keep
up
this
pulling
that
is
certain
amongst
ourselves
we
are
unendingly
cheerful
but
what
each
man
feels
in
his
heart
i
can
only
guess
putting
on
in
the
morning
is
getting
slower
and
slower
therefore
every
day
more
dangerous
the
following
extracts
are
taken
from
scott
diary
we
are
in
a
very
tight
place
indeed
but
none
of
us
despondent
or
at
least
we
preserve
every
semblance
of
good
cheer
but
one
heart
sinks
as
the
sledge
stops
dead
at
some
sastrugi
behind
which
the
surface
sand
lies
thickly
heaped
for
the
moment
the
temperature
is
in
the
an
improvement
which
makes
us
much
more
comfortable
but
a
colder
snap
is
bound
to
come
again
soon
i
fear
that
oates
at
least
will
weather
such
an
event
very
poorly
providence
to
our
aid
we
can
expect
little
from
man
now
except
the
possibility
of
extra
food
at
the
next
depôt
it
will
be
real
bad
if
we
get
there
and
find
the
same
shortage
of
oil
shall
we
get
there
such
a
short
distance
it
would
have
appeared
to
us
on
the
summit
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
if
wilson
and
bowers
were
so
determinedly
cheerful

things

regret
to

going
from

to
worse
we
got
a
slant
of
wind
yesterday
afternoon
and
going
on
hours
we
converted
our
wretched
morning
run
of
miles
into
something
over
we
went
to
bed
on
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
pemmican
solid
with
the
chill
off
the
result
is
telling
on
all
but
mainly
on
oates
whose
feet
are
in
a
wretched
condition
one
swelled
up
tremendously
last
night
and
he
is
very
lame
this
morning
we
started
march
on
tea
and
pemmican
as
last
night
we
pretend
to
prefer
the
pemmican
this
way
marched
for
hours
this
morning
over
a
slightly
better
surface
covered
with
high
moundy
sastrugi
sledge
capsized
twice
we
pulled
on
foot
covering
about
miles
we
are
two
pony
marches
and
miles
about
from
our
depôt
our
fuel
dreadfully
low
and
the
poor
soldier
nearly
done
it
is
pathetic
enough
because
we
can
do
nothing
for
him
more
hot
food
might
do
a
little
but
only
a
little
i
fear
we
none
of
us
expected
these
terribly
low
temperatures
and
of
the
rest
of
us
wilson
is
feeling
them
most
mainly
i
fear
from
his
devotion
in
doctoring
oates
feet
we
can
not
help
each
other
each
has
enough
to
do
to
take
care
of
himself
we
get
cold
on
the
march
when
the
trudging
is
heavy
and
the
wind
pierces
our
worn
garments
the
others
all
of
them
are
unendingly
cheerful
when
in
the
tent
we
mean
to
see
the
game
through
with
a
proper
spirit
but
tough
work
to
be
pulling
harder
than
we
ever
pulled
in
our
lives
for
long
hours
and
to
feel
that
the
progress
is
so
slow
one
can
only
say
help
us
and
plod
on
our
weary
way
cold
and
very
miserable
though
outwardly
cheerful
we
talk
of
all
sorts
of
subjects
in
the
tent
not
much
of
food
now
since
we
decided
to
take
the
risk
of
running
a
full
ration
we
simply
could
go
hungry
at
this
time
march
we
did
a
little
better
with
help
of
wind
yesterday
afternoon
finishing
miles
for
the
day
and
miles
from
depôt
but
this
morning
things
have
been
awful
it
was
warm
in
the
night
and
for
the
first
time
during
the
journey
i
overslept
myself
by
more
than
an
hour
then
we
were
slow
with
then
pulling
with
all
our
might
for
our
lives
we
could
scarcely
advance
at
rate
of
a
mile
an
hour
then
it
grew
thick
and
three
times
we
had
to
get
out
of
harness
to
search
for
tracks
the
result
is
something
less
than
miles
for
the
forenoon
the
sun
is
shining
now
and
the
wind
gone
poor
oates
is
unable
to
pull
sits
on
the
sledge
when
we
are
he
is
wonderfully
plucky
as
his
feet
must
be
giving
him
great
pain
he
makes
no
complaint
but
his
spirits
only
come
up
in
spurts
now
and
he
grows
more
silent
in
the
tent
we
are
making
a
spirit
lamp
to
try
and
replace
the
primus
when
our
oil
is
exhausted
march
a
little
worse
i
fear
one
of
oates
feet
bad
this
morning
he
is
wonderfully
brave
we
still
talk
of
what
we
will
do
together
at
home
we
only
made
miles
yesterday
this
morning
in
hours
we
did
just
over
miles
we
are
from
our
depôt
if
we
only
find
the
correct
proportion
of
food
there
and
this
surface
continues
we
may
get
to
the
next
depôt
mt
hooper
miles
farther
but
not
to
one
ton
camp
we
hope
against
hope
that
the
dogs
have
been
to
mt
hooper
then
we
might
pull
through
if
there
is
a
shortage
of
oil
again
we
can
have
little
hope
one
feels
that
for
poor
oates
the
crisis
is
near
but
none
of
us
are
improving
though
we
are
wonderfully
fit
considering
the
really
excessive
work
we
are
doing
we
are
only
kept
going
by
good
food
no
wind
this
morning
till
a
chill
northerly
air
came
ahead
sun
bright
and
cairns
showing
up
well
i
should
like
to
keep
the
track
to
the
end
march
worse
and
worse
in
morning
poor
oates
left
foot
can
never
last
out
and
time
over
something
awful
have
to
wait
in
night
for
nearly
an
hour
before
i
start
changing
and
then
am
generally
first
to
be
ready
wilson
feet
giving
trouble
now
but
this
mainly
because
he
gives
so
much
help
to
others
we
did
miles
this
morning
and
are
now
miles
from
the
depôt
a
ridiculously
small
distance
to
feel
in
difficulties
yet
on
this
surface
we
know
we
can
not
equal
half
our
old
marches
and
that
for
that
effort
we
expend
nearly
double
the
energy
the
great
question
is
what
shall
we
find
at
the
depôt
if
the
dogs
have
visited
it
we
may
get
along
a
good
distance
but
if
there
is
another
short
allowance
of
fuel
god
help
us
indeed
we
are
in
a
very
bad
way
i
fear
in
any
case
march
things
steadily
downhill
oates
foot
worse
he
has
rare
pluck
and
must
know
that
he
can
never
get
through
he
asked
wilson
if
he
had
a
chance
this
morning
and
of
course
bill
had
to
say
he
did
know
in
point
of
fact
he
has
none
apart
from
him
if
he
went
under
now
i
doubt
whether
we
could
get
through
with
great
care
we
might
have
a
dog
chance
but
no
more
the
weather
conditions
are
awful
and
our
gear
gets
steadily
more
icy
and
difficult
to
manage
yesterday
we
marched
up
the
depôt
mt
hooper
cold
comfort
shortage
on
our
allowance
all
round
i
do
know
that
any
one
is
to
blame
the
dogs
which
would
have
been
our
salvation
have
evidently
failed
meares
had
a
bad
trip
home
i
suppose
this
morning
it
was
calm
when
we
breakfasted
but
the
wind
came
from
the
as
we
broke
camp
it
rapidly
grew
in
strength
after
travelling
for
half
an
hour
i
saw
that
none
of
us
could
go
on
facing
such
conditions
we
were
forced
to
camp
and
are
spending
the
rest
of
the
day
in
a
comfortless
blizzard
camp
wind
quite
foul
march
titus
oates
is
very
near
the
end
one
feels
what
we
or
he
will
do
god
only
knows
we
discussed
the
matter
after
breakfast
he
is
a
brave
fine
fellow
and
understands
the
situation
but
he
practically
asked
for
advice
nothing
could
be
said
but
to
urge
him
to
march
as
long
as
he
could
one
satisfactory
result
to
the
discussion
i
practically
ordered
wilson
to
hand
over
the
means
of
ending
our
troubles
to
us
so
that
any
one
of
us
may
know
how
to
do
so
wilson
had
no
choice
between
doing
so
and
our
ransacking
the
medicine
case
we
have
opium
tabloids
apiece
and
he
is
left
with
a
tube
of
morphine
so
far
the
tragical
side
of
our
story
the
sky
completely
overcast
when
we
started
this
morning
we
could
see
nothing
lost
the
tracks
and
doubtless
have
been
swaying
a
good
deal
since
miles
for
the
forenoon
terribly
heavy
dragging
expected
it
know
that
miles
is
about
the
limit
of
our
endurance
now
if
we
get
no
help
from
wind
or
surfaces
we
have
days
food
and
should
be
about
miles
from
one
ton
camp
leaving
us
miles
short
of
our
distance
even
if
things
get
no
worse
meanwhile
the
season
rapidly
advances
march
we
did
miles
yesterday
under
our
necessary
average
things
are
left
much
the
same
oates
not
pulling
much
and
now
with
hands
as
well
as
feet
pretty
well
useless
we
did
miles
this
morning
in
hours
we
may
hope
for
this
afternoon
x
we
shall
be
miles
from
the
depôt
i
doubt
if
we
can
possibly
do
it
the
surface
remains
awful
the
cold
intense
and
our
physical
condition
running
down
god
help
us
not
a
breath
of
favourable
wind
for
more
than
a
week
and
apparently
liable
to
head
winds
at
any
moment
march
no
doubt
about
the
going
downhill
but
everything
going
wrong
for
us
yesterday
we
woke
to
a
strong
northerly
wind
with
temp
could
face
it
so
remained
in
camp
till
then
did
miles
wanted
to
march
later
but
party
feeling
the
cold
badly
as
the
breeze
never
took
off
entirely
and
as
the
sun
sank
the
temp
fell
long
time
getting
supper
in
dark
this
morning
started
with
southerly
breeze
set
sail
and
passed
another
cairn
at
good
speed
however
the
wind
shifted
to
by
or
blew
through
our
and
into
our
mitts
poor
wilson
horribly
cold
could
not
get
off
ski
for
some
time
bowers
and
i
practically
made
camp
and
when
we
got
into
the
tent
at
last
we
were
all
deadly
cold
then
temp
now
down
and
the
wind
strong
we
go
on
but
now
the
making
of
every
camp
must
be
more
difficult
and
dangerous
it
must
be
near
the
end
but
a
pretty
merciful
end
poor
oates
got
it
again
in
the
foot
i
shudder
to
think
what
it
will
be
like
it
is
only
with
greatest
pains
rest
of
us
keep
off
no
idea
there
could
be
temperatures
like
this
at
this
time
of
year
with
such
winds
truly
awful
outside
the
tent
must
fight
it
out
to
the
last
biscuit
but
ca
reduce
rations
illustration
a
blizzard
camp
wilson
del
march
or
saturday
lost
track
of
dates
but
think
the
last
correct
tragedy
all
along
the
line
at
lunch
the
day
before
yesterday
poor
titus
oates
said
he
could
go
on
he
proposed
we
should
leave
him
in
his
that
we
could
not
do
and
we
induced
him
to
come
on
on
the
afternoon
march
in
spite
of
its
awful
nature
for
him
he
struggled
on
and
we
made
a
few
miles
at
night
he
was
worse
and
we
knew
the
end
had
come
should
this
be
found
i
want
these
facts
recorded
oates
last
thoughts
were
of
his
mother
but
immediately
before
he
took
pride
in
thinking
that
his
regiment
would
be
pleased
with
the
bold
way
in
which
he
met
his
death
we
can
testify
to
his
bravery
he
has
borne
intense
suffering
for
weeks
without
complaint
and
to
the
very
last
was
able
and
willing
to
discuss
outside
subjects
he
did
not
would
not
give
up
hope
till
the
very
end
he
was
a
brave
soul
this
was
the
end
he
slept
through
the
night
before
last
hoping
not
to
wake
but
he
woke
in
the
morning
yesterday
it
was
blowing
a
blizzard
he
said
am
just
going
outside
and
may
be
some
time
he
went
out
into
the
blizzard
and
we
have
not
seen
him
since
i
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
that
we
have
stuck
to
our
sick
companions
to
the
last
in
case
of
edgar
evans
when
absolutely
out
of
food
and
he
lay
insensible
the
safety
of
the
remainder
seemed
to
demand
his
abandonment
but
providence
mercifully
removed
him
at
this
critical
moment
he
died
a
natural
death
and
we
did
not
leave
him
till
two
hours
after
his
death
we
knew
that
poor
oates
was
walking
to
his
death
but
though
we
tried
to
dissuade
him
we
knew
it
was
the
act
of
a
brave
man
and
an
english
gentleman
we
all
hope
to
meet
the
end
with
a
similar
spirit
and
assuredly
the
end
is
not
far
i
can
only
write
at
lunch
and
then
only
occasionally
the
cold
is
intense
at
my
companions
are
unendingly
cheerful
but
we
are
all
on
the
verge
of
serious
and
though
we
constantly
talk
of
fetching
through
i
do
think
any
one
of
us
believes
it
in
his
heart
we
are
cold
on
the
march
now
and
at
all
times
except
meals
yesterday
we
had
to
lay
up
for
a
blizzard
and
we
move
dreadfully
slowly
we
are
at
no
pony
camp
only
two
pony
marches
from
one
ton
depôt
we
leave
here
our
theodolite
a
camera
and
oates
diaries
and
geological
specimens
carried
at
wilson
special
request
will
be
found
with
us
or
on
our
sledge
march
lunch
we
are
miles
from
the
depôt
ill
fortune
presses
but
better
may
come
we
have
had
more
wind
and
drift
from
ahead
yesterday
had
to
stop
marching
wind
force
temp
no
human
being
could
face
it
and
we
are
worn
out
my
right
foot
has
gone
nearly
all
the
toes
two
days
ago
i
was
proud
possessor
of
best
feet
bowers
takes
first
place
in
condition
but
there
is
not
much
to
choose
after
all
the
others
are
still
confident
of
getting
through
or
pretend
to
be
i
do
know
we
have
the
last
fill
of
oil
in
our
primus
and
a
very
small
quantity
of
spirit
this
alone
between
us
and
thirst
the
wind
is
fair
for
the
moment
and
that
is
perhaps
a
fact
to
help
the
mileage
would
have
seemed
ridiculously
small
on
our
outward
journey
march
we
camped
with
difficulty
last
night
and
were
dreadfully
cold
till
after
our
supper
of
cold
pemmican
and
biscuit
and
a
half
pannikin
of
cocoa
cooked
over
the
spirit
then
contrary
to
expectation
we
got
warm
and
all
slept
well
we
started
in
the
usual
dragging
manner
sledge
dreadfully
heavy
we
are
miles
from
the
depôt
and
ought
to
get
there
in
three
days
what
progress
we
have
two
days
food
but
barely
a
day
fuel
all
our
feet
are
getting
bad
wilson
best
my
right
foot
worse
left
all
right
there
is
no
chance
to
nurse
one
feet
till
we
can
get
hot
food
into
us
amputation
is
the
least
i
can
hope
for
now
but
will
the
trouble
spread
that
is
the
serious
question
the
weather
does
give
us
a
chance
the
wind
from
to
and
temp
march
got
within
miles
of
depôt
monday
night
had
to
lay
up
all
yesterday
in
severe
blizzard
forlorn
hope
wilson
and
bowers
going
to
depôt
for
fuel
and
blizzard
bad
as
ever
wilson
and
bowers
unable
to
start
last
chance
no
fuel
and
only
one
or
two
of
food
left
must
be
near
the
end
have
decided
it
shall
be
natural
we
shall
march
for
the
depôt
with
or
without
our
effects
and
die
in
our
tracks
march
since
the
we
have
had
a
continuous
gale
from
and
we
had
fuel
to
make
two
cups
of
tea
apiece
and
bare
food
for
two
days
on
the
every
day
we
have
been
ready
to
start
for
our
depôt
away
but
outside
the
door
of
the
tent
it
remains
a
scene
of
whirling
drift
i
do
not
think
we
can
hope
for
any
better
things
now
we
shall
stick
it
out
to
the
end
but
we
are
getting
weaker
of
course
and
the
end
can
not
be
far
it
seems
a
pity
but
i
do
not
think
i
can
write
more
r
scott
for
god
sake
look
after
our
people
the
following
extracts
are
from
letters
written
by
scott
my
dear
wilson
if
this
letter
reaches
you
bill
and
i
will
have
gone
out
together
we
are
very
near
it
now
and
i
should
like
you
to
know
how
splendid
he
was
at
the
end
everlastingly
cheerful
and
ready
to
sacrifice
himself
for
others
never
a
word
of
blame
to
me
for
leading
him
into
this
mess
he
is
not
suffering
luckily
at
least
only
minor
discomforts
his
eyes
have
a
comfortable
blue
look
of
hope
and
his
mind
is
peaceful
with
the
satisfaction
of
his
faith
in
regarding
himself
as
part
of
the
great
scheme
of
the
almighty
i
can
do
no
more
to
comfort
you
than
to
tell
you
that
he
died
as
he
lived
a
brave
true
man
the
best
of
comrades
and
staunchest
of
friends
my
whole
heart
goes
out
to
you
in
pity
yours
scott
my
dear
bowers
i
am
afraid
this
will
reach
you
after
one
of
the
heaviest
blows
of
your
life
i
write
when
we
are
very
near
the
end
of
our
journey
and
i
am
finishing
it
in
company
with
two
gallant
noble
gentlemen
one
of
these
is
your
son
he
had
come
to
be
one
of
my
closest
and
soundest
friends
and
i
appreciate
his
wonderful
upright
nature
his
ability
and
energy
as
the
troubles
have
thickened
his
dauntless
spirit
ever
shone
brighter
and
he
has
remained
cheerful
hopeful
and
indomitable
to
the
end
sir
my
dear
barrie
we
are
pegging
out
in
a
very
comfortless
spot
hoping
this
letter
may
be
found
and
sent
to
you
i
write
a
word
of
farewell
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
the
end
but
sad
to
miss
many
a
humble
pleasure
which
i
had
planned
for
the
future
on
our
long
marches
i
may
not
have
proved
a
great
explorer
but
we
have
done
the
greatest
march
ever
made
and
come
very
near
to
great
success
my
dear
friend
yours
ever
scott
we
are
in
a
desperate
state
feet
frozen
etc
no
fuel
and
a
long
way
from
food
but
it
would
do
your
heart
good
to
be
in
our
tent
to
hear
our
songs
and
the
cheery
conversation
as
to
what
we
will
do
when
we
get
to
hut
point
we
are
very
near
the
end
but
have
not
and
will
not
lose
our
good
cheer
we
have
four
days
of
storm
in
our
tent
and
nowhere
food
or
fuel
we
did
intend
to
finish
ourselves
when
things
proved
like
this
but
we
have
decided
to
die
naturally
in
the
track
the
following
extracts
are
from
letters
written
to
other
friends
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
was
too
old
for
this
job
it
was
the
younger
men
that
went
under
first
after
all
we
are
setting
a
good
example
to
our
countrymen
if
not
by
getting
into
a
tight
place
by
facing
it
like
men
when
we
were
there
we
could
have
come
through
had
we
neglected
the
sick
wilson
the
best
fellow
that
ever
stepped
has
sacrificed
himself
again
and
again
to
the
sick
men
of
the
party
our
journey
has
been
the
biggest
on
record
and
nothing
but
the
most
exceptional
hard
luck
at
the
end
would
have
caused
us
to
fail
to
return
what
lots
and
lots
i
could
tell
you
of
this
journey
how
much
better
has
it
been
than
lounging
in
too
great
comfort
at
home
message
to
the
public
the
causes
of
the
disaster
are
not
due
to
faulty
organization
but
to
misfortune
in
all
risks
which
had
to
be
undertaken
the
loss
of
pony
transport
in
march
obliged
me
to
start
later
than
i
had
intended
and
obliged
the
limits
of
stuff
transported
to
be
narrowed
the
weather
throughout
the
outward
journey
and
especially
the
long
gale
in
stopped
us
the
soft
snow
in
lower
reaches
of
glacier
again
reduced
pace
we
fought
these
untoward
events
with
a
will
and
conquered
but
it
cut
into
our
provision
reserve
every
detail
of
our
food
supplies
clothing
and
depôts
made
on
the
interior
and
over
that
long
stretch
of
miles
to
the
pole
and
back
worked
out
to
perfection
the
advance
party
would
have
returned
to
the
glacier
in
fine
form
and
with
surplus
of
food
but
for
the
astonishing
failure
of
the
man
whom
we
had
least
expected
to
fail
edgar
evans
was
thought
the
strongest
man
of
the
party
the
beardmore
glacier
is
not
difficult
in
fine
weather
but
on
our
return
we
did
not
get
a
single
completely
fine
day
this
with
a
sick
companion
enormously
increased
our
anxieties
as
i
have
said
elsewhere
we
got
into
frightfully
rough
ice
and
edgar
evans
received
a
concussion
of
the
brain
he
died
a
natural
death
but
left
us
a
shaken
party
with
the
season
unduly
advanced
but
all
the
facts
above
enumerated
were
as
nothing
to
the
surprise
which
awaited
us
on
the
barrier
i
maintain
that
our
arrangements
for
returning
were
quite
adequate
and
that
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
expected
the
temperatures
and
surfaces
which
we
encountered
at
this
time
of
the
year
on
the
summit
in
lat
we
had
on
the
barrier
in
lat
feet
lower
we
had
in
the
day
at
night
pretty
regularly
with
continuous
during
our
day
marches
it
is
clear
that
these
circumstances
come
on
very
suddenly
and
our
wreck
is
certainly
due
to
this
sudden
advent
of
severe
weather
which
does
not
seem
to
have
any
satisfactory
cause
i
do
not
think
human
beings
ever
came
through
such
a
month
as
we
have
come
through
and
we
should
have
got
through
in
spite
of
the
weather
but
for
the
sickening
of
a
second
companion
captain
oates
and
a
shortage
of
fuel
in
our
depôts
for
which
i
can
not
account
and
finally
but
for
the
storm
which
has
fallen
on
us
within
miles
of
the
depôt
at
which
we
hoped
to
secure
our
final
supplies
surely
misfortune
could
scarcely
have
exceeded
this
last
blow
we
arrived
within
miles
of
our
old
one
ton
camp
with
fuel
for
one
last
meal
and
food
for
two
days
for
four
days
we
have
been
unable
to
leave
the
tent
the
gale
howling
about
us
we
are
weak
writing
is
difficult
but
for
my
own
sake
i
do
not
regret
this
journey
which
has
shown
that
englishmen
can
endure
hardships
help
one
another
and
meet
death
with
as
great
a
fortitude
as
ever
in
the
past
we
took
risks
we
knew
we
took
them
things
have
come
out
against
us
and
therefore
we
have
no
cause
for
complaint
but
bow
to
the
will
of
providence
determined
still
to
do
our
best
to
the
last
but
if
we
have
been
willing
to
give
our
lives
to
this
enterprise
which
is
for
the
honour
of
our
country
i
appeal
to
our
countrymen
to
see
that
those
who
depend
on
us
are
properly
cared
for
had
we
lived
i
should
have
had
a
tale
to
tell
of
the
hardihood
endurance
and
courage
of
my
companions
which
would
have
stirred
the
heart
of
every
englishman
these
rough
notes
and
our
dead
bodies
must
tell
the
tale
but
surely
surely
a
great
rich
country
like
ours
will
see
that
those
who
are
dependent
on
us
are
properly
provided

never

and
now
in

i

again
after
so
many
deaths
i
live
and
write
i
once
more
smell
the
dew
and
rain
and
relish
versing
o
my
onely
light
it
can
not
be
that
i
am
he
on
whom
thy
tempests
fell
all
night
herbert
i
shall
inevitably
be
asked
for
a
word
of
mature
judgment
of
the
expedition
of
a
kind
that
was
impossible
when
we
were
all
close
up
to
it
and
when
i
was
a
subaltern
of
not
incapable
of
judging
my
elders
but
too
young
to
have
found
out
whether
my
judgment
was
worth
anything
i
now
see
very
plainly
that
though
we
achieved
a
tragedy
which
will
never
be
forgotten
just
because
it
was
a
tragedy
tragedy
was
not
our
business
in
the
broad
perspective
opened
up
by
ten
years
distance
i
see
not
one
journey
to
the
pole
but
two
in
startling
contrast
one
to
another
on
the
one
hand
amundsen
going
straight
there
getting
there
first
and
returning
without
the
loss
of
a
single
man
and
without
having
put
any
greater
strain
on
himself
and
his
men
than
was
all
in
the
work
of
polar
exploration
nothing
more
could
be
imagined
on
the
other
hand
our
expedition
running
appalling
risks
performing
prodigies
of
superhuman
endurance
achieving
immortal
renown
commemorated
in
august
cathedral
sermons
and
by
public
statues
yet
reaching
the
pole
only
to
find
our
terrible
journey
superfluous
and
leaving
our
best
men
dead
on
the
ice
to
ignore
such
a
contrast
would
be
ridiculous
to
write
a
book
without
accounting
for
it
a
waste
of
time
first
let
me
do
full
justice
to
amundsen
i
have
not
attempted
to
disguise
how
we
felt
towards
him
when
after
leading
us
to
believe
that
he
had
equipped
the
fram
for
an
arctic
journey
and
sailed
for
the
north
he
suddenly
made
his
dash
for
the
south
nothing
makes
a
more
unpleasant
impression
than
a
feint
but
when
scott
reached
the
pole
only
to
find
that
amundsen
had
been
there
a
month
before
him
his
distress
was
not
that
of
a
schoolboy
who
has
lost
a
race
i
have
described
what
it
had
cost
scott
and
his
four
companions
to
get
to
the
pole
and
what
they
had
still
to
suffer
in
returning
until
death
stopped
them
much
of
that
risk
and
racking
toil
had
been
undertaken
that
men
might
learn
what
the
world
is
like
at
the
spot
where
the
sun
does
not
decline
in
the
heavens
where
a
man
loses
his
orbit
and
turns
like
a
joint
on
a
spit
and
where
his
face
however
he
turns
is
always
to
the
north
the
moment
scott
saw
the
norwegian
tent
he
knew
that
he
had
nothing
to
tell
that
was
not
already
known
his
achievement
was
a
mere
precaution
against
amundsen
perishing
on
his
way
back
and
that
risk
was
no
greater
than
his
own
the
polar
journey
was
literally
laid
waste
that
was
the
shock
that
staggered
them
well
might
bowers
be
glad
to
see
the
last
of
norskies
tracks
as
their
homeward
paths
diverged
all
this
heartsickness
has
passed
away
now
and
the
future
explorer
will
not
concern
himself
with
it
he
will
ask
what
was
the
secret
of
amundsen
slick
success
what
is
the
moral
of
our
troubles
and
losses
i
will
take
amundsen
success
first
undoubtedly
the
very
remarkable
qualities
of
the
man
himself
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
it
there
is
a
sort
of
sagacity
that
constitutes
the
specific
genius
of
the
explorer
and
amundsen
proved
his
possession
of
this
by
his
guess
that
there
was
terra
firma
in
the
bay
of
whales
as
solid
as
on
ross
island
then
there
is
the
quality
of
big
leadership
which
is
shown
by
daring
to
take
a
big
chance
amundsen
took
a
very
big
one
indeed
when
he
turned
from
the
route
to
the
pole
explored
and
ascertained
by
scott
and
shackleton
and
determined
to
find
a
second
pass
over
the
mountains
from
the
barrier
to
the
plateau
as
it
happened
he
succeeded
and
established
his
route
as
the
best
way
to
the
pole
until
a
better
is
discovered
but
he
might
easily
have
failed
and
perished
in
the
attempt
and
the
combination
of
reasoning
and
daring
that
nerved
him
to
make
it
can
hardly
be
overrated
all
these
things
helped
him
yet
any
rather
conservative
whaling
captain
might
have
refused
to
make
scott
experiment
with
motor
transport
ponies
and
and
stuck
to
the
dogs
and
to
the
use
of
ski
in
running
those
dogs
and
it
was
this
quite
commonplace
choice
that
sent
amundsen
so
gaily
to
the
pole
and
back
with
no
abnormal
strain
on
men
or
dogs
and
no
great
hardship
either
he
never
pulled
a
mile
from
start
to
finish
the
very
ease
of
the
exploit
makes
it
impossible
to
infer
from
it
that
amundsen
expedition
was
more
highly
endowed
in
personal
qualities
than
ours
we
did
not
suffer
from
too
little
brains
or
daring
we
may
have
suffered
from
too
much
we
were
primarily
a
great
scientific
expedition
with
the
pole
as
our
bait
for
public
support
though
it
was
not
more
important
than
any
other
acre
of
the
plateau
we
followed
in
the
steps
of
a
polar
expedition
which
brought
back
more
results
than
any
of
its
forerunners
scott
discovery
voyage
we
had
the
largest
and
most
efficient
scientific
staff
that
ever
left
england
we
were
discursive
we
were
full
of
intellectual
interests
and
curiosities
of
all
kinds
we
took
on
the
work
of
two
or
three
expeditions
it
is
obvious
that
there
are
disadvantages
in
such
a
division
of
energy
scott
wanted
to
reach
the
pole
a
dangerous
and
laborious
exploit
but
a
practicable
one
wilson
wanted
to
obtain
the
egg
of
the
emperor
penguin
a
horribly
dangerous
and
inhumanly
exhausting
feat
which
is
none
the
less
impracticable
because
the
three
men
who
achieved
it
survived
by
a
miracle
these
two
feats
had
to
be
piled
one
on
top
of
the
other
what
with
the
depôt
journey
and
others
in
addition
to
these
two
we
were
sledged
out
by
the
end
of
our
second
sledging
season
and
our
worst
year
was
still
to
come
we
the
survivors
went
in
search
of
the
dead
when
there
was
a
possibly
living
party
waiting
in
the
ice
somewhere
for
us
to
succour
them
that
turned
out
all
right
because
when
we
got
back
we
found
campbell
party
and
waiting
for
us
alive
and
well
but
suppose
they
also
had
perished
what
would
have
been
said
of
us
the
practical
man
of
the
world
has
plenty
of
criticism
of
the
way
things
were
done
he
says
dogs
should
have
been
taken
but
he
does
not
show
how
they
could
have
been
got
up
and
down
the
beardmore
he
is
scandalized
because
lbs
of
geological
specimens
were
deliberately
added
to
the
weight
of
the
sledge
that
was
dragging
the
life
out
of
the
men
who
had
to
haul
it
but
he
does
not
realize
that
it
is
the
friction
surfaces
of
the
snow
on
the
runners
which
mattered
and
not
the
dead
weight
which
in
this
case
was
almost
negligible
nor
does
he
know
that
these
same
specimens
dated
a
continent
and
may
elucidate
the
whole
history
of
plant
life
he
will
admit
that
we
were
all
very
wonderful
very
heroic
very
beautiful
and
devoted
that
our
exploits
gave
a
glamour
to
our
expedition
that
amundsen
can
not
claim
but
he
has
no
patience
with
us
and
declares
that
amundsen
was
perfectly
right
in
refusing
to
allow
science
to
use
up
the
forces
of
his
men
or
to
interfere
for
a
moment
with
his
single
business
of
getting
to
the
pole
and
back
again
no
doubt
he
was
but
we
were
not
out
for
a
single
business
we
were
out
for
everything
we
could
add
to
the
world
store
of
knowledge
about
the
antarctic
of
course
the
whole
business
simply
bristles
with
ifs
if
scott
had
taken
dogs
and
succeeded
in
getting
them
up
the
beardmore
if
we
had
not
lost
those
ponies
on
the
depôt
journey
if
the
dogs
had
not
been
taken
so
far
and
the
one
ton
depôt
had
been
laid
if
a
pony
and
some
extra
oil
had
been
depôted
on
the
barrier
if
a
party
had
been
taken
to
the
pole
if
i
had
disobeyed
my
instructions
and
gone
on
from
one
ton
killing
dogs
as
necessary
or
even
if
i
had
just
gone
on
a
few
miles
and
left
some
food
and
fuel
under
a
flag
upon
a
cairn
if
they
had
been
first
at
the
pole
if
it
had
been
any
other
season
but
that
but
always
the
bare
fact
remains
that
scott
could
not
have
travelled
from
mcmurdo
sound
to
the
pole
faster
than
he
did
except
with
dogs
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
could
not
have
done
it
why
then
says
the
practical
man
did
we
go
to
mcmurdo
sound
instead
of
to
the
bay
of
whales
because
we
gained
that
continuity
of
scientific
observation
which
is
so
important
in
this
work
and
because
the
sound
was
the
for
continuing
the
exploration
of
the
only
ascertained
route
to
the
pole
via
the
beardmore
glacier
i
am
afraid
it
was
all
inevitable
we
were
as
wise
as
any
one
can
be
before
the
event
i
admit
that
we
scrupulously
economical
of
our
pemmican
were
terribly
prodigal
of
our
but
we
had
to
be
the
draft
whatever
it
may
have
been
on
the
whole
was
not
excessive
at
any
given
point
and
anyhow
we
just
had
to
use
every
man
to
take
every
opportunity
there
is
so
much
to
do
and
the
opportunities
for
doing
it
are
so
rare
generally
speaking
i
do
see
how
we
could
have
done
differently
but
i
do
want
to
see
it
done
again
i
do
want
it
to
be
necessary
to
do
it
again
i
want
to
see
this
country
tackle
the
job
and
send
enough
men
to
do
one
thing
at
a
time
they
do
it
in
canada
why
not
in
england
too
but
we
wasted
our
in
one
way
which
could
have
been
avoided
i
have
described
how
every
emergency
was
met
by
calling
for
volunteers
and
how
the
volunteers
were
always
forthcoming
unfortunately
volunteering
was
relied
on
not
only
for
emergencies
but
for
a
good
deal
of
everyday
work
that
should
have
been
organised
as
routine
and
the
inevitable
result
was
that
the
willing
horses
were
overworked
it
was
a
point
of
honour
not
to
ca
canny
men
were
allowed
to
do
too
much
and
were
told
afterwards
that
they
had
done
too
much
and
that
is
not
discipline
they
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
do
too
much
until
our
last
year
we
never
insisted
on
a
regular
routine
money
was
scarce
probably
scott
could
not
have
obtained
the
funds
for
the
expedition
if
its
objective
had
not
been
the
pole
there
was
no
lack
of
the
things
which
could
be
bought
across
the
counter
from
big
business
houses
all
landing
sledging
and
scientific
equipment
was
but
one
of
the
first
and
most
important
items
the
ship
would
have
sent
columbus
on
strike
and
nearly
sent
us
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
people
talk
of
the
niggardly
equipment
of
columbus
when
he
sailed
west
from
the
canaries
to
try
a
to
an
inhabited
continent
of
magnificent
empires
as
he
thought
but
his
three
ships
were
relatively
to
the
resources
of
that
time
much
better
than
the
one
old
tramp
in
which
we
sailed
for
a
desert
of
ice
in
which
the
evening
and
morning
are
the
year
and
not
the
day
and
in
which
not
even
polar
bears
and
reindeers
can
live
amundsen
had
the
fram
built
for
polar
exploration
scott
had
the
discovery
but
when
one
thinks
of
these
nimrods
and
terra
novas
picked
up
in
the
market
and
faked
up
for
the
transport
of
ponies
dogs
motors
and
all
the
impedimenta
of
a
polar
expedition
to
say
nothing
of
the
men
who
have
to
try
and
do
scientific
work
inside
them
one
feels
disposed
to
clamour
for
a
polar
factory
act
making
it
a
crime
to
ship
men
for
the
ice
in
vessels
more
fit
to
ply
between
london
bridge
and
ramsgate
and
then
the
begging
that
is
necessary
to
obtain
even
this
equipment
shackleton
hanging
round
the
doors
of
rich
men
scott
writing
begging
letters
for
months
together
is
the
country
not
ashamed
modern
civilized
states
should
make
up
their
minds
to
the
endowment
of
research
which
includes
exploration
and
as
all
states
benefit
alike
by
the
scientific
side
of
it
there
is
plenty
of
scope
for
international
arrangement
especially
in
a
region
where
the
mere
grabbing
of
territory
is
meaningless
and
no
foreign
office
can
trace
the
frontier
between
king
edward
plateau
and
king
haakon
the
antarctic
continent
is
still
mostly
unexplored
but
enough
is
known
of
it
to
put
any
settlement
by
ordinary
pioneer
emigration
pilgrim
fathers
and
the
like
out
of
the
question
ross
island
is
not
a
place
for
a
settlement
it
is
a
place
for
an
elaborately
equipped
scientific
station
with
a
staff
in
residence
for
a
year
at
a
time
our
stay
of
three
years
was
far
too
much
another
year
would
have
driven
the
best
of
us
mad
of
the
five
main
journeys
which
fell
to
my
lot
one
the
winter
journey
should
not
have
been
undertaken
at
all
with
our
equipment
and
two
others
the
dog
journey
and
the
search
journey
had
better
have
been
done
by
fresh
men
it
is
no
use
repeating
that
englishmen
will
respond
to
every
call
and
stick
it
to
the
death
they
will
some
of
them
but
they
have
to
pay
the
price
all
the
same
and
the
price
in
my
case
was
an
overdraft
on
my
vital
capital
which
i
shall
never
quite
pay
off
and
in
the
case
of
five
bigger
stronger
more
seasoned
men
death
the
establishment
of
such
stations
and
of
such
a
service
can
not
be
done
by
individual
heroes
and
enthusiasts
cadging
for
cheques
from
rich
men
and
grants
from
private
scientific
societies
it
is
a
business
like
the
nares
arctic
expedition
for
public
organization
i
do
not
suppose
that
in
these
days
of
aviation
the
next
visit
to
the
pole
will
be
made
by
men
on
foot
dragging
sledges
or
by
men
on
sledges
dragged
by
dogs
mules
or
ponies
nor
will
depôts
be
laid
in
that
way
the
pack
will
not
i
hope
be
broken
through
by
any
old
ship
that
can
be
picked
up
in
the
market
specially
built
ships
and
enough
of
them
specially
engined
tractors
and
aeroplanes
specially
trained
men
and
plenty
of
them
will
all
be
needed
if
the
work
is
to
be
done
in
any
sort
of
humane
and
civilized
fashion
and
cabinet
ministers
and
voters
alike
must
learn
to
value
knowledge
that
is
not
baited
by
suffering
and
death
my
own
bolt
is
shot
i
do
not
suppose
i
shall
ever
go
south
again
before
i
go
west
but
if
i
do
it
will
be
under
proper
and
reasonable
conditions
i
may
not
come
back
a
hero
but
i
shall
come
back
none
the
worse
for
i
repeat
the
antarctic
in
moderation
as
to
length
of
stay
and
with
such
accommodation
as
is
now
easily
within
the
means
of
modern
civilized
powers
is
not
half
as
bad
a
place
for
public
service
as
the
worst
military
stations
on
the
equator
i
hope
that
by
the
time
scott
comes
home
for
he
is
coming
home
the
barrier
is
moving
and
not
a
trace
of
our
funeral
cairn
was
found
by
shackleton
men
in
the
hardships
that
wasted
his
life
will
be
only
a
horror
of
the
past
and
his
a
highway
as
practicable
as
piccadilly
and
now
let
me
come
down
to
tin
tacks
no
matter
how
well
the
thing
is
done
in
future
its
organizers
will
want
to
know
at
first
all
we
can
tell
them
about
oil
about
cold
and
about
food
first
as
to
oil
scott
complains
of
a
shortage
of
oil
at
several
of
his
last
depôts
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
shortage
was
due
to
the
perishing
of
the
leather
washers
of
the
tins
which
contained
the
paraffin
oil
all
these
tins
had
been
subjected
to
the
warmth
of
the
sun
in
summer
and
the
autumn
temperatures
which
were
unexpectedly
cold
in
his
voyage
of
the
discovery
scott
wrote
as
follows
of
the
tins
in
which
they
drew
their
oil
when
sledging
each
tin
had
a
small
cork
bung
which
was
a
decided
weakness
paraffin
in
the
most
annoying
manner
and
a
good
deal
of
oil
was
wasted
in
this
way
especially
when
the
sledges
were
travelling
over
rough
ground
and
were
shaken
or
as
frequently
happened
capsized
it
was
impossible
to
make
these
bungs
quite
tight
however
closely
they
were
jammed
down
so
that
in
spite
of
a
trifling
extra
weight
a
much
better
fitting
would
have
been
a
metallic
screwed
bung
to
find
on
opening
a
fresh
tin
of
oil
that
it
was
only
full
was
very
distressing
and
of
course
meant
that
the
cooker
had
to
be
used
with
still
greater
care
amundsen
wrote
of
his
paraffin
we
kept
it
in
the
usual
cans
but
they
proved
too
weak
not
that
we
lost
any
paraffin
but
bjaaland
had
to
be
constantly
soldering
to
keep
them
tight
our
own
tins
were
furnished
with
the
metallic
screwed
stoppers
which
scott
recommended
there
was
no
trouble
reported
until
we
came
up
to
one
ton
camp
when
on
the
search
journey
here
was
the
depôt
of
food
and
oil
which
i
had
laid
in
the
previous
autumn
for
the
polar
party
stowed
in
a
canvas
which
was
buried
beneath
seven
feet
of
snow
the
oil
was
placed
on
the
top
of
the
snow
in
order
that
the
red
tins
might
prove
an
additional
mark
for
the
depôt
when
we
dug
out
the
tank
the
food
inside
was
almost
uneatable
owing
to
the
quantity
of
paraffin
which
had
found
its
way
down
through
seven
feet
of
snow
during
the
winter
and
spring
we
then
found
the
polar
party
and
learned
of
the
shortage
of
oil
after
our
return
to
cape
evans
some
one
was
digging
about
the
camp
and
came
across
a
wooden
case
containing
eight
tins
of
paraffin
these
had
been
placed
there
in
september
to
be
landed
at
cape
crozier
by
the
terra
nova
when
she
came
down
the
ship
could
not
take
them
they
were
snowed
up
during
the
winter
lost
and
forgotten
until
dug
up
fifteen
months
afterwards
three
tins
were
full
three
empty
one
a
third
full
and
one
full
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
oil
which
was
specially
volatile
tended
to
vaporize
and
escape
through
the
stoppers
and
that
this
process
was
accelerated
by
the
perishing
and
i
suggest
also
the
hardening
and
shrinking
of
the
leather
washers
another
expedition
will
have
to
be
very
careful
on
this
point
they
might
reduce
the
risk
by
burying
the
oil
the
second
point
about
which
something
must
be
said
is
the
unexpected
cold
met
by
scott
on
the
barrier
which
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
disaster
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
expected
the
temperatures
and
surfaces
which
we
encountered
at
this
time
of
the
year
it
is
clear
that
these
circumstances
come
on
very
suddenly
and
our
wreck
is
certainly
due
to
this
sudden
advent
of
severe
weather
which
does
not
seem
to
have
any
satisfactory
cause
they
came
down
the
glacier
in
plus
temperatures
nor
was
there
anything
abnormal
for
more
than
a
week
after
they
got
on
to
the
barrier
then
there
came
a
big
drop
to
a
minimum
on
the
night
of
february
it
is
significant
that
the
sun
began
to
dip
below
the
southern
horizon
at
midnight
about
this
time
there
is
no
doubt
the
middle
of
the
barrier
is
a
pretty
awful
locality
wrote
scott
simpson
in
his
meteorological
report
has
little
doubt
that
the
temperatures
met
by
the
polar
party
were
abnormal
the
records
clearly
bring
to
light
the
possibility
of
great
cold
at
an
extremely
early
period
in
the
year
within
a
comparatively
few
miles
of
an
open
sea
where
the
temperatures
were
over
degrees
higher
it
is
quite
impossible
to
believe
that
normally
there
is
a
difference
of
nearly
degrees
in
march
between
mcmurdo
sound
and
the
south
of
the
barrier
the
temperatures
recorded
by
other
sledge
parties
in
march
and
those
recorded
at
cape
evans
form
additional
evidence
in
simpson
opinion
that
the
temperatures
experienced
by
scott
were
not
such
as
might
be
expected
during
normal
autumn
weather
simpson
explanation
is
based
upon
the
observations
made
in
mcmurdo
sound
by
sending
up
balloons
with
instruments
attached
these
showed
that
very
rapid
radiation
takes
place
from
the
snow
surface
in
winter
which
cools
the
air
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
a
cold
layer
of
air
is
thus
formed
near
the
ground
which
may
be
many
degrees
colder
than
the
air
above
it
it
becomes
as
it
were
colder
than
it
ought
to
be
this
however
can
only
happen
during
an
absence
of
wind
when
a
wind
blows
the
cold
layer
is
swept
away
the
air
is
mixed
and
the
temperature
rises
the
absence
of
wind
from
the
south
noted
by
scott
was
in
opinion
the
cause
of
the
low
temperatures
met
by
scott
the
temperature
was
reduced
ten
degrees
below
normal
at
cape
evans
and
perhaps
twenty
degrees
where
scott
was
the
third
question
is
that
of
food
it
is
this
point
which
is
most
important
to
future
explorers
it
is
a
fact
that
the
polar
party
failed
to
make
their
distance
because
they
became
weak
and
that
they
became
weak
although
they
were
eating
their
full
ration
or
more
than
their
full
ration
of
food
save
for
a
few
days
when
they
went
short
on
the
way
down
the
beardmore
glacier
the
first
man
to
weaken
was
the
biggest
and
heaviest
man
in
the
expedition
the
man
whom
we
had
least
expected
to
fail
the
rations
were
of
two
kinds
the
barrier
b
ration
was
that
which
was
used
on
the
barrier
during
the
outward
journey
towards
the
pole
the
summit
s
ration
was
the
result
of
our
experiments
on
the
winter
journey
i
expect
it
is
the
best
ration
which
has
been
used
to
date
and
consisted
of
biscuits
pemmican
butter
cocoa
sugar
and
tea
ounces
total
ounces
daily
per
man
the
twelve
men
who
went
forward
started
this
s
ration
at
the
foot
of
the
beardmore
and
it
was
this
ration
which
was
left
in
all
depôts
to
see
them
home
it
was
much
more
satisfying
than
the
barrier
ration
and
men
could
not
have
eaten
so
much
when
leading
ponies
or
driving
dogs
in
the
early
stages
of
summer
barrier
sledging
but
is
a
different
business
altogether
from
leading
ponies
or
driving
dogs
it
is
calculated
that
the
body
requires
certain
proportions
of
fat
carbohydrates
and
proteins
to
do
certain
work
under
certain
conditions
but
just
what
the
absolute
quantities
are
is
not
ascertained
the
work
of
the
polar
party
was
laborious
the
temperatures
the
most
important
of
the
conditions
varied
from
comparative
warmth
up
and
down
the
glacier
to
an
average
of
about
in
the
rarefied
air
of
the
plateau
the
temperatures
met
by
them
on
their
return
over
the
barrier
were
not
really
low
for
more
than
a
week
and
then
there
came
quite
commonly
minus
thirties
during
the
day
with
a
further
drop
to
minus
forties
at
night
when
for
a
time
the
sun
was
below
the
horizon
these
temperatures
which
are
not
very
terrible
to
men
who
are
fresh
and
whose
clothing
is
new
were
ghastly
to
these
men
who
had
striven
night
and
day
almost
ceaselessly
for
four
months
on
as
i
maintain
insufficient
food
did
these
temperatures
kill
them
undoubtedly
the
low
temperatures
caused
their
death
inasmuch
as
they
would
have
lived
had
the
temperatures
remained
high
but
evans
would
not
have
lived
he
died
before
the
low
temperatures
occurred
what
killed
evans
and
why
did
the
other
men
weaken
as
they
did
though
they
were
eating
full
rations
and
more
weaken
so
much
that
in
the
end
they
starved
to
death
i
have
always
had
a
doubt
whether
the
weather
conditions
were
sufficient
to
cause
the
tragedy
these
men
on
full
rations
were
supposed
to
be
eating
food
of
sufficient
value
to
enable
them
to
do
the
work
they
were
doing
under
the
conditions
which
they
actually
met
until
the
end
of
february
without
loss
of
strength
they
had
more
than
their
full
rations
but
the
conditions
in
march
were
much
worse
than
they
imagined
to
be
possible
when
three
survivors
out
of
the
five
pitched
their
last
camp
they
were
in
a
terrible
state
after
the
war
i
found
that
atkinson
had
come
to
wonder
much
as
i
but
he
had
gone
farther
for
he
had
the
values
of
our
rations
worked
out
by
a
chemical
expert
according
to
the
latest
knowledge
and
standards
i
may
add
that
being
in
command
after
scott
death
he
increased
the
ration
for
the
next
year
sledging
so
i
suppose
he
had
already
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
previous
ration
was
not
sufficient
the
following
are
some
of
the
data
for
which
i
am
indebted
to
him
the
whole
subject
will
be
investigated
by
him
and
the
results
published
in
a
more
detailed
form
according
to
the
most
modern
standards
the
food
requirements
for
laborious
work
at
a
temperature
of
zero
fahr
which
is
a
fair
barrier
average
temperature
to
take
are
calories
to
produce
of
work
the
actual
barrier
ration
which
we
used
would
generate
calories
equivalent
to
of
work
similar
requirements
for
laborious
work
at
fahr
which
is
a
high
average
plateau
temperature
are
calories
to
produce
of
work
the
actual
summit
ration
would
generate
calories
equivalent
to
of
work
these
requirements
are
calculated
for
total
absorption
of
all
but
in
practice
by
visual
proof
this
does
not
take
place
this
is
especially
noticeable
in
the
case
of
fats
a
quantity
of
which
were
digested
neither
by
men
ponies
nor
dogs
several
things
go
to
prove
that
our
ration
was
not
enough
in
the
first
case
we
were
probably
not
as
fit
as
we
seemed
after
long
sledge
journeys
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
sledging
men
developed
an
automaticity
of
certain
muscles
at
the
expense
of
other
muscles
for
instance
a
sledge
could
be
hauled
all
day
at
the
expense
of
the
arms
and
we
had
little
power
to
lift
weights
at
the
end
of
several
months
of
sledging
in
relation
to
this
i
would
add
that
when
the
relief
ship
arrived
in
february
four
of
us
were
at
cape
evans
but
just
arrived
from
three
months
of
the
polar
journey
the
land
party
we
four
among
them
were
turned
on
to
sledge
stores
ashore
this
in
practice
meant
twenty
miles
every
day
dragging
a
sledge
a
good
deal
of
heavy
cases
from
five
in
the
morning
to
very
late
at
night
with
uncertain
meals
and
no
rests
i
can
remember
now
how
hard
that
work
was
to
myself
and
i
expect
to
those
others
who
had
been
away
sledging
the
ship
party
sledged
only
every
other
day
because
they
were
not
used
to
it
this
was
extremely
bad
organization
and
in
view
of
the
possibility
that
some
of
the
men
might
be
required
for
further
sledging
in
the
autumn
just
silly
again
there
is
the
experience
of
the
parties
of
the
polar
journey
there
was
you
may
remember
a
party
on
the
way
to
the
beardmore
glacier
they
travelled
with
a
light
sledge
but
they
lost
weight
on
the
barrier
ration
it
is
significant
that
they
picked
up
condition
when
they
started
the
summit
ration
especially
lashly
the
polar
party
and
the
two
returning
parties
who
were
on
the
summit
ration
from
the
foot
of
the
beardmore
until
the
end
of
their
journeys
weakened
in
atkinson
opinion
more
than
they
should
have
done
had
their
ration
been
sufficient
the
first
return
party
covered
approximately
statute
miles
at
the
end
of
their
journey
their
pulling
muscles
were
all
right
but
atkinson
who
led
the
party
considers
that
they
were
at
least
per
cent
weaker
in
other
muscles
they
all
lost
a
great
deal
of
weight
though
they
had
the
best
conditions
of
the
three
returning
parties
and
the
temperatures
met
by
them
averaged
well
over
zero
the
second
return
party
faced
much
worse
conditions
they
were
only
three
men
and
one
of
the
three
was
so
sick
that
for
miles
he
could
not
pull
and
for
miles
he
had
to
be
dragged
on
the
sledge
the
average
temperature
approximated
zero
they
were
extremely
exhausted
scott
makes
constant
reference
to
the
increasing
hunger
of
the
polar
party
it
is
clear
that
the
food
did
not
compensate
for
the
conditions
which
were
met
in
increasing
severity
yet
they
were
eating
rather
more
than
their
full
ration
a
considerable
part
of
the
time
it
has
to
be
considered
that
the
temperatures
met
by
them
averaged
far
below
that
they
did
not
absorb
all
their
food
that
increased
heat
was
wanted
not
only
for
energy
to
do
extra
work
caused
by
bad
surfaces
and
contrary
winds
but
also
to
heat
their
bodies
and
to
thaw
out
their
clothing
and
i
believe
it
to
be
clear
that
the
rations
used
by
us
must
not
only
be
increased
by
future
expeditions
but
in
different
proportions
of
fats
proteins
and
carbohydrates
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
our
bodies
were
not
digesting
the
amount
of
fats
we
had
provided
atkinson
suggests
that
it
is
useless
to
increase
the
fats
at
the
expense
of
the
protein
and
carbohydrates
he
recommends
that
fats
should
total
about
ounces
daily
the
digestion
of
carbohydrates
is
easy
and
complete
and
though
that
of
protein
is
more
complicated
there
are
plenty
of
the
necessary
digestive
ferments
the
ration
should
be
increased
by
equal
amounts
of
protein
and
carbohydrates
both
should
be
provided
in
as
dry
and
pure
a
form
as
possible
there
is
no
censure
attached
to
this
criticism
our
ration
was
probably
the
best
which
has
been
used
but
more
is
known
now
than
was
known
then
we
are
all
out
to
try
and
get
these
things
right
for
the
future
campbell
reached
hut
point
only
five
days
after
we
left
it
with
the
a
characteristic
note
left
to
greet
us
on
our
return
regretted
they
were
too
late
to
take
part
in
the
search
journey
if
i
had
lived
through
ten
months
such
as
those
men
had
just
endured
wild
horses
would
not
have
dragged
me
out
sledging
again
but
they
were
keen
to
get
some
useful
work
done
in
the
time
which
remained
until
the
ship
arrived
we
had
the
polar
records
campbell
and
his
men
unaided
had
not
only
survived
their
terrible
winter
but
had
sledged
down
the
coast
after
it
we
ourselves
faced
by
a
difficult
alternative
had
fallen
on
our
feet
we
never
hoped
for
more
than
this
we
seldom
hoped
for
so
much
i
wanted
a
series
of
adélie
penguin
embryos
from
the
rookery
at
cape
royds
but
had
not
expected
an
opportunity
of
getting
them
because
i
was
away
sledging
during
the
summer
months
now
the
chance
had
come
atkinson
wanted
to
work
on
parasites
at
the
same
place
and
others
to
survey
but
the
real
job
was
an
ascent
of
erebus
the
active
volcano
which
rose
from
our
doors
to
some
feet
in
height
a
party
of
shackleton
men
under
professor
david
went
up
it
in
march
and
managed
to
haul
a
sledge
up
to
feet
from
which
point
they
had
to
portage
their
gear
a
year
before
this
debenham
with
the
help
of
a
telescope
selected
a
route
by
which
they
could
haul
a
sledge
up
to
feet
there
proved
to
be
no
great
difficulty
about
it
it
was
just
a
matter
of
legs
and
breath
they
were
a
cheery
company
in
the
evenings
and
working
hard
all
day
it
was
an
uneventful
trip
debenham
said
and
very
harmonious
the
best
trip
he
had
down
there
both
debenham
and
dickason
suffered
from
mountain
sickness
however
and
they
were
the
two
smokers
the
clearness
of
the
air
was
marked
at
feet
they
could
plainly
see
mount
melbourne
and
cape
jones
between
two
and
three
hundred
miles
away
and
several
uncharted
mountains
over
to
the
west
but
they
were
unable
to
plot
them
accurately
because
they
could
get
direction
rays
from
one
point
only
the
sound
itself
was
covered
by
cloud
most
of
the
time
but
beaufort
island
and
franklin
island
were
clear
unlike
david
party
they
could
see
no
signs
whatever
of
volcanic
action
on
mount
bird
which
is
almost
entirely
covered
with
ice
on
which
it
was
to
be
expected
that
some
mark
might
be
left
at
feet
terror
looked
very
imposing
but
mount
bird
and
terra
nova
were
insignificant
and
uninteresting
the
valley
between
the
old
crater
and
the
slopes
of
the
second
crater
greatly
impressed
them
and
they
found
a
fine
little
crevassed
glacier
in
it
both
priestley
and
debenham
are
of
opinion
that
it
is
possible
to
get
to
terror
by
this
valley
and
that
there
are
no
crevassed
areas
or
impossible
slopes
on
the
way
all
the
same
it
would
probably
be
more
sensible
to
go
from
cape
crozier
at
a
point
about
feet
up
priestley
gran
abbott
and
hooper
started
to
make
the
ascent
to
the
active
crater
on
december
they
packed
the
tent
poles
bags
inner
cooker
and
cooking
gear
with
four
provisions
and
reached
the
second
crater
at
about
feet
to
be
hung
up
by
cloud
all
the
next
day
at
these
altitudes
the
temperature
varied
between
and
though
at
simultaneously
they
were
round
about
by
on
the
the
conditions
were
good
clear
with
a
southerly
wind
blowing
the
steam
away
from
the
summit
the
party
got
away
as
soon
as
possible
and
reached
the
lip
of
the
active
crater
in
a
few
hours
looking
down
they
were
unable
to
see
the
bottom
for
it
was
full
of
steam
the
sides
sloped
at
a
steep
angle
for
some
feet
when
they
became
sheer
precipices
the
opening
appeared
to
be
about
paces
round
the
top
is
mostly
pumice
but
there
is
also
a
lot
of
kenyte
much
the
same
as
at
the
old
crater
was
mostly
kenyte
proving
that
this
is
the
oldest
rock
of
the
island
felspar
crystals
must
be
continually
thrown
out
for
they
were
lying
about
on
the
top
of
the
snow
i
have
one
nearly
inches
long
two
men
went
back
to
the
camp
for
one
had
a
foot
this
left
priestley
and
gran
who
tried
to
boil
the
hypsometer
but
failed
owing
to
the
wind
which
was
variable
and
enveloped
them
from
time
to
time
in
steam
and
sulphur
vapour
they
left
a
record
on
a
cairn
and
started
to
return
but
when
they
had
got
feet
down
priestley
found
that
he
had
left
a
tin
of
exposed
films
on
the
top
instead
of
the
record
gran
said
he
would
go
back
and
change
it
he
had
reached
the
top
when
there
was
a
loud
explosion
large
blocks
of
pumice
were
hurled
out
with
a
big
smoke
cloud
probably
a
big
bubble
had
burst
gran
was
in
the
middle
of
it
heard
it
gurgle
before
it
burst
saw
blocks
of
pumiceous
lava
in
shape
like
the
halves
of
volcanic
bombs
and
with
bunches
of
long
shreds
of
glass
in
their
interior
this
was
pélé
hair
gran
was
a
bit
sick
from
sulphur
dioxide
fumes
afterwards
they
reached
cape
royds
on
the
the
very
successful
trip
taking
fifteen
days
meanwhile
shackleton
old
hut
was
very
pleasant
at
this
time
of
year
in
winter
it
was
a
bit
too
draughty
with
bright
sunlight
a
lop
on
the
sea
which
splashed
and
gurgled
under
the
the
beautiful
mountains
all
round
us
and
the
penguins
nesting
at
our
door
this
was
better
than
the
beardmore
glacier
where
we
had
expected
to
be
at
this
date
what
then
must
it
have
been
to
the
six
men
who
were
just
returned
from
the
very
gate
of
hell
and
the
food
truly
shackleton
men
must
have
fed
like
from
all
the
delicacies
here
boiled
chicken
kidneys
mushrooms
ginger
garibaldi
biscuits
soups
of
all
kinds
it
is
a
splendid
change
best
of
all
are
the
skua
eggs
which
we
make
for
breakfast
in
fact
life
is
bearable
with
all
that
has
been
unknown
so
long
at
last
cleared
up
and
our
anxieties
for
party
laid
at
rest
for
three
weeks
i
worked
among
the
adélie
penguins
at
cape
royds
and
obtained
a
complete
series
of
their
embryos
it
was
always
wilson
idea
that
embryology
was
the
next
job
of
a
vertebral
zoologist
down
south
i
have
already
explained
that
the
penguin
is
an
interesting
link
in
the
evolutionary
chain
and
the
object
of
getting
this
embryo
is
to
find
out
where
the
penguins
come
in
whether
or
no
they
are
more
primitive
than
other
nonflying
birds
such
as
the
apteryx
the
ostrich
the
rhea
and
the
moa
which
last
is
only
just
extinct
is
an
open
question
but
wingless
birds
are
still
hanging
on
to
the
promontories
of
the
southern
continents
where
there
is
less
rivalry
than
in
the
highly
populated
land
areas
of
the
north
it
may
be
that
penguins
are
descended
from
ancestors
who
lived
in
the
northern
hemisphere
in
a
winged
condition
even
now
you
may
sometimes
see
them
try
to
fly
and
that
they
have
been
driven
towards
the
south
if
penguins
are
primitive
it
is
rational
to
infer
that
the
most
primitive
penguin
is
farthest
south
these
are
the
two
antarcticists
the
emperor
and
the
adélie
the
latter
appears
to
be
the
more
numerous
and
successful
of
the
two
and
for
this
reason
we
are
inclined
to
search
among
the
emperors
as
being
among
the
most
primitive
penguins
if
not
the
most
primitive
of
birds
now
living
hence
the
winter
journey
i
was
glad
to
get
in
addition
this
series
of
adélie
penguins
embryos
feeling
somewhat
like
a
giant
who
had
wandered
on
to
the
wrong
planet
and
who
was
distinctly
in
the
way
of
its
true
inhabitants
we
returned
too
late
to
see
the
eggs
laid
and
therefore
it
was
impossible
to
tell
how
old
the
embryos
were
my
hopes
rose
however
when
i
saw
some
eggless
nests
with
penguins
sitting
upon
them
but
later
i
found
that
these
were
used
as
bachelor
quarters
by
birds
whose
wives
were
sitting
near
i
tried
taking
eggs
from
nests
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
new
eggs
appeared
these
i
carefully
marked
and
it
was
not
until
i
opened
one
two
days
later
to
find
inside
an
embryo
at
least
two
weeks
old
that
i
realized
that
penguins
added
to
their
other
immoralities
some
of
those
from
whom
i
took
eggs
sat
upon
stones
of
a
similar
size
and
shape
with
every
appearance
of
content
one
sat
upon
the
half
of
the
red
tin
of
a
dutch
cheese
they
are
not
very
intelligent
all
the
world
loves
a
penguin
i
think
it
is
because
in
many
respects
they
are
like
ourselves
and
in
some
respects
what
we
should
like
to
be
had
we
but
half
their
physical
courage
none
could
stand
against
us
had
we
a
hundredth
part
of
their
maternal
instinct
we
should
have
to
kill
our
children
by
the
thousand
their
little
bodies
are
so
full
of
curiosity
that
they
have
no
room
for
fear
they
like
mountaineering
and
on
they
even
like
to
drill
one
day
there
had
been
a
blizzard
and
lying
open
to
the
view
of
all
was
a
deserted
nest
a
pile
of
coveted
stones
all
the
surrounding
rookery
made
their
way
to
and
fro
each
husband
acquiring
merit
for
after
each
journey
he
gave
his
wife
a
stone
this
was
the
plebeian
way
of
doing
things
but
my
friend
who
stood
ever
so
unconcerned
upon
a
rock
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
he
and
his
wife
who
sat
so
cosily
upon
the
other
side
the
victim
was
a
third
penguin
he
was
without
a
mate
but
this
was
an
opportunity
to
get
one
with
all
the
speed
his
little
legs
could
compass
he
ran
to
and
fro
taking
stones
from
the
deserted
nest
laying
them
beneath
a
rock
and
hurrying
back
for
more
on
that
same
rock
was
my
friend
when
the
victim
came
up
with
his
stone
he
had
his
back
turned
but
as
soon
as
the
stone
was
laid
and
the
other
gone
for
more
he
jumped
down
seized
it
with
his
beak
ran
round
gave
it
to
his
wife
and
was
back
on
the
rock
with
his
back
turned
before
you
could
say
killer
whale
every
now
and
then
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
where
the
next
stone
might
be
i
watched
this
for
twenty
minutes
all
that
time
and
i
do
not
know
for
how
long
before
that
wretched
bird
was
bringing
stone
after
stone
and
there
were
no
stones
there
once
he
looked
puzzled
looked
up
and
swore
at
the
back
of
my
friend
on
his
rock
but
immediately
he
came
back
and
he
never
seemed
to
think
he
had
better
stop
it
was
getting
cold
and
i
went
away
he
was
coming
for
another
the
life
of
an
adélie
penguin
is
one
of
the
most
unchristian
and
successful
in
the
world
the
penguin
which
went
in
for
being
a
true
believer
would
never
stand
the
ghost
of
a
chance
watch
them
go
to
bathe
some
fifty
or
sixty
agitated
birds
are
gathered
upon
the
peering
over
the
edge
telling
one
another
how
nice
it
will
be
and
what
a
good
dinner
they
are
going
to
have
but
this
is
all
swank
they
are
really
worried
by
a
horrid
suspicion
that
a
is
waiting
to
eat
the
first
to
dive
the
really
noble
bird
according
to
our
theories
would
say
i
will
go
first
and
if
i
am
killed
i
shall
at
any
rate
have
died
unselfishly
sacrificing
my
life
for
my
companions
and
in
time
all
the
most
noble
birds
would
be
dead
what
they
really
do
is
to
try
and
persuade
a
companion
of
weaker
mind
to
plunge
failing
this
they
hastily
pass
a
conscription
act
and
push
him
over
and
then
bang
in
go
all
the
rest
they
take
turns
in
sitting
on
their
eggs
and
after
many
days
the
fathers
may
be
seen
waddling
down
towards
the
sea
with
their
muddied
their
long
trick
done
it
may
be
a
fortnight
before
they
return
clean
pleased
with
life
and
with
a
grim
determination
to
relieve
their
wives
to
do
their
job
sometimes
they
are
met
by
others
going
to
bathe
they
stop
and
pass
the
time
of
day
well
perhaps
it
would
be
more
pleasant
and
what
does
a
day
or
two
matter
anyhow
they
turn
clean
and
dirty
alike
are
off
to
the
seaside
again
this
is
when
they
say
the
women
are
splendid
life
is
too
strenuous
for
them
to
have
any
use
for
the
virtues
of
brotherly
love
good
works
charity
and
benevolence
when
they
mate
the
best
thief
wins
when
they
nest
the
best
pair
of
thieves
hatch
out
their
eggs
in
a
long
unbroken
stream
which
stretches
down
below
the
horizon
they
march
in
from
the
open
sea
some
are
walking
on
their
human
feet
others
tobogganing
upon
their
shiny
white
breasts
after
their
long
walk
they
must
have
a
sleep
and
then
the
gentlemen
make
their
way
into
the
already
crowded
rookery
to
find
them
wives
but
first
a
suitor
must
find
or
steal
a
pebble
for
such
are
the
penguin
jewels
they
are
of
lava
black
russet
or
grey
with
crystals
bedded
in
them
they
are
rare
and
of
all
sizes
but
that
which
is
most
valued
is
the
size
of
a
pigeon
egg
armed
with
one
of
these
he
courts
his
maid
laying
it
at
her
feet
if
accepted
he
steals
still
more
stones
she
guards
them
jealously
taking
in
the
meantime
any
safe
opportunity
to
pick
others
from
under
her
nearest
neighbours
any
penguin
which
is
unable
to
fight
and
steal
successfully
fails
to
make
a
good
high
nest
or
loses
it
when
made
then
comes
a
blizzard
and
after
that
a
thaw
for
it
thaws
sometimes
right
down
by
the
where
the
adélies
have
their
nurseries
the
eggs
of
the
strong
and
wicked
hatch
out
but
those
of
the
weak
are
addled
you
must
have
a
jolly
good
pile
of
stones
to
hatch
eggs
after
a
blizzard
like
that
in
december
when
the
rookeries
were
completely
nests
eggs
parents
and
all
once
hatched
the
chicks
grow
quickly
from
pretty
grey
atoms
of
down
to
black
lumps
of
stomach
topped
by
a
small
and
quite
inadequate
head
they
are
two
or
more
weeks
old
and
they
leave
their
parents
or
their
parents
leave
them
i
do
not
know
which
if
socialism
be
the
nationalization
of
the
means
of
production
and
distribution
then
they
are
socialists
they
divide
into
parents
and
children
the
adult
community
comes
up
from
the
open
sea
bringing
food
inside
them
they
are
full
of
shrimps
but
not
for
their
own
children
these
if
not
already
dead
are
lost
in
a
crowd
of
hungry
tottering
infants
which
besiege
each
as
he
arrives
but
not
all
of
them
can
get
food
though
all
of
them
are
hungry
some
have
already
been
behindhand
too
long
they
have
not
managed
to
secure
food
for
days
and
they
are
weak
and
cold
and
very
weary
as
we
stood
there
and
watched
this
race
for
food
we
were
gradually
possessed
with
the
idea
that
the
chicks
looked
upon
each
adult
coming
up
from
the
shore
as
not
a
parent
only
but
a
the
parents
were
labouring
under
a
totally
different
idea
and
intended
either
to
find
their
own
infants
and
feed
them
or
else
to
assimilate
their
already
partially
digested
catch
themselves
the
more
robust
of
the
young
thus
worried
an
adult
until
because
of
his
importunity
he
was
fed
but
with
the
less
robust
a
much
more
pathetic
ending
was
the
rule
a
chick
that
had
fallen
behind
in
this
literal
race
for
life
starving
and
weak
and
getting
daily
weaker
because
it
could
not
run
fast
enough
to
insist
on
being
fed
again
and
again
ran
off
pursuing
with
the
rest
again
and
again
it
stumbled
and
fell
persistently
whining
out
its
hunger
in
a
shrill
and
melancholy
pipe
till
at
last
the
race
was
given
up
forced
thus
by
sheer
exhaustion
to
stop
and
rest
it
had
no
chance
of
getting
food
each
hurrying
parent
with
its
little
following
of
hungry
chicks
intent
on
one
thing
only
rushed
quickly
by
and
the
starveling
dropped
behind
to
gather
strength
for
one
more
effort
again
it
fails
a
robuster
bird
has
forced
the
pace
and
again
success
is
wanting
to
the
runt
sleepily
it
stands
there
with
eyes
in
a
torpor
resulting
from
exhaustion
cold
and
hunger
wondering
perhaps
what
all
the
bustle
round
it
means
a
little
dirty
dishevelled
dot
in
the
race
for
life
a
failure
deserted
by
its
parents
who
have
hunted
vainly
for
their
own
offspring
round
the
nest
in
which
they
hatched
it
but
from
which
it
may
by
now
have
wandered
half
a
mile
and
so
it
stands
lost
to
everything
around
till
a
skua
in
its
beat
drops
down
beside
it
and
with
a
few
strong
vicious
pecks
puts
an
end
to
the
failing
life
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
this
kind
of
treatment
the
adélie
penguin
has
a
hard
life
the
emperor
penguin
a
horrible
one
why
not
kill
off
the
unfit
right
away
before
they
have
had
time
to
breed
almost
before
they
have
had
time
to
eat
life
is
a
stern
business
in
any
case
why
pretend
that
it
is
anything
else
or
that
any
but
the
best
can
survive
at
all
and
in
consequence
i
challenge
you
to
find
a
more
jolly
happy
healthy
lot
of
old
gentlemen
in
the
world
we
admire
them
if
only
because
they
are
so
much
nicer
than
ourselves
but
it
is
grim
nature
is
an
uncompromising
nurse
nature
was
going
to
give
us
a
bad
time
too
if
we
were
not
relieved
and
on
january
as
there
were
still
no
signs
of
the
ship
it
was
decided
to
prepare
for
another
winter
we
were
to
go
on
rations
to
cook
with
oil
for
nearly
all
the
coal
was
gone
to
kill
and
store
up
seal
on
january
we
started
our
preparations
digging
a
cave
to
store
more
meat
and
so
forth
i
went
off
seal
hunting
after
breakfast
and
having
killed
and
cut
up
two
came
back
across
the
cape
at
all
the
men
were
out
working
in
the
camp
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
in
the
sound
and
then
quite
suddenly
the
bows
of
the
ship
came
out
from
behind
the
end
of
the
barne
glacier
two
or
three
miles
away
we
watched
her
cautious
approach
with
immense
relief
are
you
all
well
through
a
megaphone
from
the
bridge
the
polar
party
died
on
their
return
from
the
pole
we
have
their
records
a
pause
and
then
a
boat
evans
who
had
been
to
england
and
made
a
good
recovery
from
scurvy
was
in
command
with
him
were
pennell
rennick
bruce
lillie
and
drake
they
reported
having
had
a
very
big
gale
indeed
on
their
way
home
last
year
we
got
some
apples
off
the
ship
beauties
i
want
nothing
better
pennell
is
as
always
one
notices
among
the
ship
men
a
rather
unnatural
way
of
talking
not
so
much
in
special
instances
but
as
a
whole
contact
with
civilization
gives
it
an
affected
sound
i
notice
it
in
both
officers
and
men
on
board
the
terra
after
hours
loading
we
left
the
old
hut
for
good
and
all
at
this
afternoon
it
has
been
a
bit
of
a
rush
and
little
sleep
last
night
it
is
quite
wonderful
now
to
be
travelling
a
day
journey
in
an
hour
we
went
to
cape
royds
in
about
that
time
and
took
off
geological
and
zoological
specimens
i
should
like
to
sit
up
and
sketch
all
these
views
which
would
have
meant
long
travelling
without
the
ship
but
i
feel
very
tired
the
mail
is
almost
too
good
for
words
now
with
the
latest
waltz
on
the
gramophone
beer
for
dinner
and
apples
and
fresh
vegetables
to
eat
life
is
more
bearable
than
it
has
been
for
many
a
long
weary
week
and
month
i
leave
cape
evans
with
no
regret
i
never
want
to
see
the
place
again
the
pleasant
memories
are
all
swallowed
up
in
the
bad
ones
before
the
ship
arrived
it
was
decided
among
us
to
urge
the
erection
of
a
cross
on
observation
hill
to
the
memory
of
the
polar
party
on
the
arrival
of
the
ship
the
carpenter
immediately
set
to
work
to
make
a
great
cross
of
jarrah
wood
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
the
inscription
it
being
urged
that
there
should
be
some
quotation
from
the
bible
because
the
women
think
a
lot
of
these
things
but
i
was
glad
to
see
the
concluding
line
of
tennyson
ulysses
adopted
to
strive
to
seek
to
find
and
not
to
yield
the
open
water
stretched
about
a
mile
and
a
half
south
of
tent
island
and
here
we
left
the
ship
to
sledge
the
cross
to
hut
point
at
on
january
the
party
consisted
of
atkinson
wright
lashly
crean
debenham
keohane
and
davies
the
ship
carpenter
and
myself
hut
we
had
a
most
unpleasant
experience
coming
in
we
struck
wind
and
drift
just
about
a
mile
from
hut
point
then
we
saw
there
was
a
small
thaw
pool
off
the
point
and
came
out
to
give
it
a
wide
berth
atkinson
put
his
feet
down
into
water
we
turned
sharp
out
and
then
crean
went
right
in
up
to
his
arms
and
we
realized
that
the
ice
was
not
more
than
three
or
four
inches
of
slush
i
managed
to
give
him
a
hand
out
without
the
ice
giving
and
we
went
on
floundering
about
then
crean
went
right
in
again
and
the
sledge
nearly
went
too
we
pulled
the
sledge
and
the
sledge
pulled
him
out
except
for
some
more
soft
patches
that
was
all
but
it
was
quite
enough
i
think
we
got
out
of
it
most
fortunately
crean
got
some
dry
clothes
here
and
the
cross
has
had
a
coat
of
white
paint
and
is
drying
we
went
up
observation
hill
and
have
found
a
good
spot
right
on
the
top
and
have
already
dug
a
hole
which
will
with
the
rock
alongside
give
us
three
feet
from
there
we
can
see
that
this
year
old
ice
is
in
a
terrible
state
open
water
and
open
water
slush
all
over
near
the
land
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
here
off
cape
armitage
and
at
the
pram
point
pressure
it
is
extra
bad
i
only
hope
we
can
find
a
safe
way
back
you
would
not
think
crean
had
had
such
a
pair
of
duckings
to
hear
him
talking
so
merrily
i
really
do
think
the
cross
is
going
to
look
fine
observation
hill
was
clearly
the
place
for
it
it
knew
them
all
so
well
three
of
them
were
discovery
men
who
lived
three
years
under
its
shadow
they
had
seen
it
time
after
time
as
they
came
back
from
hard
journeys
on
the
barrier
observation
hill
and
castle
rock
were
the
two
which
always
welcomed
them
in
it
commanded
mcmurdo
sound
on
one
side
where
they
had
lived
and
the
barrier
on
the
other
where
they
had
died
no
more
fitting
pedestal
a
pedestal
which
in
itself
is
nearly
feet
high
could
have
been
found
january
rousing
out
at
we
got
the
large
piece
of
the
cross
up
observation
hill
by
it
was
a
heavy
job
and
the
ice
was
looking
very
bad
all
round
and
i
for
one
was
glad
when
we
had
got
it
up
by
or
so
it
is
really
magnificent
and
will
be
a
permanent
memorial
which
could
be
seen
from
the
ship
nine
miles
off
with
a
naked
eye
it
stands
nine
feet
out
of
the
rocks
and
many
feet
into
the
ground
and
i
do
not
believe
it
will
ever
move
when
it
was
up
facing
out
over
the
barrier
we
gave
three
cheers
and
one
more
we
got
back
to
the
ship
all
right
and
coasted
up
the
western
mountains
to
granite
harbour
a
wonderfully
interesting
trip
to
those
of
us
who
had
only
seen
these
mountains
from
a
distance
gran
went
off
to
pick
up
a
depôt
of
geological
specimens
lillie
did
a
trawl
this
was
an
absorbing
business
though
it
was
only
one
of
a
long
and
important
series
made
during
the
voyages
of
the
terra
nova
here
were
all
kinds
of
sponges
siliceous
glass
rope
tubular
and
they
were
generally
covered
with
mucus
some
fed
on
diatoms
so
minute
that
they
can
only
be
collected
by
centrifuge
some
have
gastric
juices
to
dissolve
the
siliceous
skeletons
of
the
diatoms
on
which
they
feed
they
anchor
themselves
in
the
mud
and
pass
water
in
and
out
of
their
bodies
sometimes
the
current
is
stimulated
by
cilia
there
were
colonies
of
gorgonacea
which
share
their
food
unselfishly
and
corals
and
marine
degenerate
worms
which
started
to
live
in
little
cells
like
coral
but
have
gone
down
in
the
world
and
there
were
starfishes
and
the
are
formed
of
hexagonal
plates
the
centre
of
each
of
which
is
a
ball
upon
which
a
spine
works
on
a
ball
and
socket
joint
these
spines
are
used
for
protection
and
when
large
they
can
be
used
for
locomotion
but
the
real
means
of
locomotion
are
five
double
rows
of
feet
working
by
suction
by
which
they
withdraw
the
water
inside
a
receptacle
in
the
shell
thereby
forming
a
vacuum
starfishes
do
the
same
we
found
a
species
of
which
had
such
large
spines
that
they
practically
formed
bars
the
spines
were
twice
as
long
as
the
and
shaped
just
like
oars
being
even
fluted
a
lobster
grows
by
discarding
his
suit
hiding
and
getting
another
growing
meanwhile
a
snail
or
an
oyster
retains
his
original
shell
and
adds
to
it
in
layers
all
the
way
down
increasing
one
edge
but
our
grows
by
an
increment
of
calcareous
matter
all
round
the
outside
of
each
plate
as
the
animal
grows
the
plates
get
bigger
there
was
a
which
nurses
its
young
having
a
brood
cavity
which
is
really
formed
out
of
the
mouth
this
is
a
peculiarity
of
a
new
antarctic
genus
found
first
on
the
discovery
it
has
the
most
complex
which
it
uses
as
legs
and
a
few
limy
rods
in
its
soft
skin
instead
of
the
bony
calcareous
plates
of
and
starfish
after
them
came
the
a
relic
of
the
old
crinoids
which
used
to
flourish
in
the
carboniferous
period
examples
of
which
can
be
found
in
the
derbyshire
limestone
and
there
were
thousands
of
like
beautiful
wheels
of
which
the
hubs
and
spokes
remained
but
not
the
circumference
these
spokes
or
legs
are
muscular
sensory
and
locomotive
they
differ
from
the
starfishes
in
that
they
have
no
digestive
glands
in
their
legs
and
from
the
in
that
they
do
not
use
their
legs
to
waft
food
into
their
mouths
once
upon
a
time
they
had
a
stalk
and
were
anchored
to
a
rock
and
there
are
still
very
rare
old
stalked
echinoderms
living
in
the
sea
this
apparently
geological
thing
was
found
by
wyville
thomson
in
still
living
in
the
seas
to
the
north
of
scotland
and
this
find
started
the
challenger
expedition
for
soundings
in
but
the
challenger
brought
back
little
in
this
line
most
of
the
species
we
found
were
peculiar
to
the
antarctic
there
were
polychaete
worms
by
the
hundred
showing
the
protrusable
mouth
which
is
shoved
into
the
mud
and
then
brought
back
into
the
body
and
the
bristles
on
the
highly
developed
projections
which
act
as
legs
by
which
they
get
about
the
mud
these
beasts
have
apparently
given
rise
to
the
arthropods
in
a
modified
and
later
form
they
had
taken
to
living
in
a
tube
both
for
protection
and
because
they
found
that
they
could
not
go
through
the
mud
which
had
become
too
viscous
for
them
so
they
stand
up
in
a
tube
and
collect
the
sediment
which
is
falling
by
means
of
tentacles
they
spread
from
one
locality
to
another
by
going
through
a
plankton
embryonic
stage
in
their
youth
they
may
be
compared
to
the
mason
worms
which
also
build
tubes
but
as
lillie
squatted
on
the
poop
surrounded
by
an
inner
ring
of
jars
and
tangled
masses
of
the
catch
and
an
outer
ring
of
curious
scientists
and
seamen
no
find
pleased
him
so
much
as
the
frequent
discovery
of
pieces
of
cephalodiscus
rarus
of
which
even
now
there
are
but
some
four
jars
full
in
the
world
it
is
as
interesting
as
it
is
uncommon
for
its
ancestor
was
a
link
between
the
vertebrates
and
invertebrates
though
no
one
knows
what
it
was
like
it
has
been
a
vertebrate
and
gone
back
and
now
has
the
signs
of
a
notochord
in
early
life
and
it
also
has
gills
first
found
on
the
graham
land
side
of
the
antarctic
continent
it
has
only
recently
been
discovered
in
the
ross
sea
and
occurs
nowhere
else
in
the
world
so
far
as
is
known
we
left
granite
harbour
in
the
early
morning
of
january
and
started
to
make
our
way
out
our
next
job
was
to
pick
up
the
geological
specimens
at
evans
coves
where
campbell
and
his
men
had
wintered
in
the
igloo
and
also
to
leave
a
depôt
there
for
future
explorers
we
met
very
heavy
pack
having
to
return
at
least
twelve
miles
and
try
another
way
the
sea
has
been
freezing
out
here
which
seems
an
extraordinary
thing
at
this
time
of
year
there
was
a
thin
layer
of
ice
over
the
water
between
the
floes
this
morning
and
i
feel
sure
that
most
of
these
big
level
floes
of
which
we
have
seen
several
are
the
remains
of
ice
which
has
frozen
comparatively
recently
the
propeller
had
a
bad
time
constantly
catching
up
on
ice
at
length
we
were
some
thirty
miles
north
of
cape
bird
making
roughly
towards
franklin
island
that
night
we
made
good
progress
in
fairly
open
water
and
we
passed
franklin
island
during
the
day
but
the
outlook
was
so
bad
in
the
evening
january
that
we
stopped
and
banked
fires
we
lay
just
where
we
stopped
until
at
on
january
when
the
ice
eased
up
sufficiently
for
us
to
get
along
and
we
started
to
make
the
same
slow
progress
slow
ahead
stop
to
the
bump
and
grind
for
a
bit
then
slow
astern
stop
slow
ahead
again
and
so
on
until
at
after
one
real
big
bump
which
brought
the
dinner
some
inches
off
the
table
cheetham
brought
us
out
into
open
water
mount
nansen
rose
sheer
and
massive
ahead
of
us
with
a
table
top
and
at
on
january
we
were
passing
the
dark
brown
granite
headland
of
the
northern
foothills
we
were
soon
made
fast
to
a
stretch
of
some
yards
of
thick
upon
which
the
wind
had
not
left
a
particle
of
snow
and
before
us
the
foothills
formed
that
opening
which
campbell
had
well
named
hell
gate
i
wish
i
had
seen
that
igloo
with
its
black
and
blubber
and
beastliness
those
who
saw
it
came
back
with
faces
of
amazement
and
admiration
we
left
a
depôt
at
the
head
of
the
bay
marked
with
a
bamboo
and
a
flag
and
then
we
turned
homewards
counting
the
weeks
and
days
and
then
the
hours
in
the
early
hours
of
january
we
left
the
pack
on
january
we
were
off
cape
adare
head
sea
and
wind
and
fog
very
ticklish
work
groping
along
hardly
seeing
the
ship
length
then
it
lifts
and
there
is
a
fair
horizon
everybody
pretty
including
most
of
the
seamen
from
cape
evans
all
of
us
feeling
rotten
very
thick
that
night
and
difficult
going
at
lat
a
partial
clearance
showed
a
berg
right
ahead
by
night
it
was
blowing
a
full
gale
and
it
was
not
too
easy
to
keep
in
our
bunks
our
object
was
now
to
make
east
in
order
to
allow
for
the
westerlies
later
on
we
passed
a
very
large
number
of
bergs
varied
every
now
and
then
by
growlers
on
february
latitude
and
longitude
we
coasted
along
one
side
of
a
berg
which
was
geographical
miles
long
the
only
other
side
of
which
we
got
a
good
view
stretched
away
until
lost
below
the
horizon
in
latitude
and
longitude
we
had
a
real
bad
day
head
wind
from
early
morning
and
simply
crowds
of
bergs
all
round
at
we
had
to
wedge
in
between
a
berg
and
a
long
line
of
pack
before
we
could
find
a
way
through
then
thick
fog
came
down
at
i
went
out
of
the
door
and
almost
knocked
my
head
against
a
great
berg
which
was
just
not
touching
the
ship
on
the
starboard
side
there
was
a
heavy
and
the
sea
sounded
cold
as
it
dashed
against
the
ice
after
crossing
the
deck
it
was
just
possible
to
see
in
the
fog
that
there
was
a
great
barrier
berg
just
away
on
the
port
side
we
groped
round
the
starboard
berg
to
find
others
beyond
our
friend
on
the
opposite
side
was
continuous
and
apparently
without
end
it
was
soon
clear
that
we
were
in
a
narrow
between
one
very
large
berg
and
a
number
of
others
it
took
an
hour
and
a
quarter
of
groping
to
leave
the
big
berg
behind
at
six
hours
later
we
were
still
just
feeling
our
way
along
and
we
had
hopes
of
being
out
of
the
ice
in
this
latitude
the
terra
nova
is
a
wood
barque
built
in
by
stephen
sons
dundee
tonnage
gross
and
net
measuring
x
x
compound
engines
with
two
cylinders
of
nominal
registered
at
johns
newfoundland
she
is
therefore
not
by
any
means
small
as
polar
ships
go
but
pennell
and
his
men
worked
her
with
bergs
and
growlers
all
round
them
generally
with
a
big
sea
running
and
often
in
darkness
or
fog
on
this
occasion
we
were
spared
many
of
the
most
ordinary
dangers
it
was
summer
our
voyage
was
an
easy
one
there
was
twilight
most
of
the
night
there
were
plenty
of
men
on
board
and
heaps
of
coal
imagine
then
what
kind
of
time
pennell
and
his
company
had
in
late
autumn
after
remaining
in
the
south
until
only
a
bare
ration
of
coal
was
left
for
steaming
until
the
sea
was
freezing
round
them
and
the
propeller
brought
up
dead
as
they
tried
to
force
their
way
through
it
pennell
was
a
very
sober
person
in
his
statements
yet
he
described
the
gale
through
which
the
terra
nova
passed
on
her
way
to
new
zealand
in
march
as
seeming
to
blow
the
ship
from
the
top
of
one
wave
to
the
top
of
the
next
and
the
nights
were
dark
and
the
bergs
were
all
round
them
they
never
tried
to
lay
a
meal
in
those
days
they
just
ate
what
they
could
hold
in
their
hands
he
confessed
to
me
that
one
hour
he
did
begin
to
wonder
what
was
going
to
happen
next
others
told
me
that
he
seemed
to
enjoy
every
minute
of
it
all
owing
to
press
contracts
and
the
necessity
of
preventing
leakage
of
news
the
terra
nova
had
to
remain
at
sea
for
hours
after
a
cable
had
been
sent
to
england
also
it
was
of
the
first
importance
that
the
relatives
should
be
informed
of
the
facts
before
the
newspapers
published
them
and
so
at
on
february
we
crept
like
a
phantom
ship
into
the
little
harbour
of
oamaru
on
the
east
coast
of
new
zealand
with
what
mixed
feelings
we
smelt
the
old
familiar
woods
and
grassy
slopes
and
saw
the
shadowy
outlines
of
human
homes
with
untiring
persistence
the
little
lighthouse
blinked
out
the
message
what
ship
that
what
that
they
were
obviously
puzzled
and
disturbed
at
getting
no
answer
a
boat
was
lowered
and
pennell
and
atkinson
were
rowed
ashore
and
landed
the
seamen
had
strict
orders
to
answer
no
questions
after
a
little
the
boat
returned
and
crean
announced
we
was
chased
sorr
but
they
got
nothing
out
of
us
we
put
out
to
sea
when
morning
broke
we
could
see
the
land
in
the
distance
greenness
trees
every
now
and
then
a
cottage
we
began
to
feel
impatient
we
unpacked
the
clothes
with
their
creases
three
years
old
which
had
been
sent
out
from
home
tried
them
on
and
they
felt
unpleasantly
tight
we
put
on
our
boots
and
they
were
positively
agony
we
shaved
off
our
beards
there
was
a
hiatus
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
sail
up
and
down
the
coast
and
if
possible
avoid
coastwise
craft
in
the
evening
the
little
ship
which
runs
daily
from
akaroa
to
lyttelton
put
out
to
sea
on
her
way
and
ranged
close
alongside
are
all
well
where
captain
scott
did
you
reach
the
pole
rather
unsatisfactory
answers
and
away
they
went
our
first
glimpse
however
of
civilized
life
at
dawn
the
next
morning
with
white
ensign
at
we
crept
through
lyttelton
heads
always
we
looked
for
trees
people
and
houses
how
different
it
was
from
the
day
we
left
and
yet
how
much
the
same
as
though
we
had
dreamed
some
horrible
nightmare
and
could
scarcely
believe
we
were
not
dreaming
still
the
came
out
in
the
tug
and
with
him
atkinson
and
pennell
come
down
here
a
minute
said
atkinson
to
me
and
it
made
a
tremendous
impression
i
had
no
idea
it
would
make
so
much
he
said
and
indeed
we
had
been
too
long
away
and
the
whole
thing
was
so
personal
to
us
and
our
perceptions
had
been
blunted
we
never
realized
we
landed
to
find
the
empire
almost
the
civilized
world
in
mourning
it
was
as
though
they
had
lost
great
friends
to
a
sensitive
world
the
knowledge
of
these
men
deaths
came
as
a
great
shock
and
now
although
the
world
has
almost
lost
the
sense
of
tragedy
it
appeals
to
their
pity
and
their
pride
the
disaster
may
well
be
the
first
thing
which
scott
name
recalls
to
your
mind
as
though
an
event
occurred
in
the
life
of
columbus
which
caused
you
to
forget
that
he
discovered
america
but
scott
reputation
is
not
founded
upon
the
conquest
of
the
south
pole
he
came
to
a
new
continent
found
out
how
to
travel
there
and
gave
knowledge
of
it
to
the
world
he
discovered
the
antarctic
and
founded
a
school
he
is
the
last
of
the
great
geographical
explorers
it
is
useless
to
try
and
light
a
fire
when
everything
has
been
burned
and
he
is
probably
the
last
polar
explorer
for
as
i
believe
the
future
of
such
exploration
is
in
the
air
but
not
yet
and
he
was
strong
we
never
realized
until
we
found
him
lying
there
dead
how
strong
mentally
and
physically
that
man
was
in
both
his
polar
expeditions
he
was
helped
to
an
extent
which
will
never
be
appreciated
by
wilson
in
the
last
expedition
by
bowers
i
believe
that
there
has
never
been
a
finer
sledge
party
than
these
three
men
who
combined
in
themselves
initiative
endurance
and
high
ideals
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
they
could
organize
they
did
organize
the
polar
journey
and
their
organization
seemed
to
have
failed
did
it
fail
scott
said
no
the
causes
of
this
disaster
are
not
due
to
faulty
organization
but
to
misfortune
in
all
risks
which
had
to
be
undertaken
nine
times
out
of
ten
says
the
meteorologist
he
would
have
come
through
but
he
struck
the
tenth
we
took
risks
we
knew
we
took
them
things
have
come
out
against
us
and
therefore
we
have
no
cause
for
complaint
no
better
epitaph
has
been
written
he
decided
to
use
the
only
route
towards
the
pole
of
which
the
world
had
any
knowledge
that
is
to
go
up
the
beardmore
glacier
then
the
only
discovered
way
up
through
the
mountains
which
divide
the
polar
plateau
from
the
great
ice
barrier
probably
it
is
the
only
possible
passage
for
those
who
travel
from
mcmurdo
sound
the
alternative
was
to
winter
on
the
barrier
as
amundsen
did
so
many
hundred
miles
away
from
the
that
in
travelling
south
the
chaos
caused
in
the
ice
plain
by
the
beardmore
in
its
outward
flow
would
be
avoided
to
do
so
meant
the
abandonment
of
a
great
part
of
the
scientific
programme
and
scott
was
not
a
man
to
go
south
just
to
reach
the
pole
amundsen
knew
that
scott
was
going
to
mcmurdo
sound
when
he
decided
to
winter
in
the
bay
of
whales
otherwise
he
might
have
gone
to
mcmurdo
sound
probably
no
man
would
have
refused
the
knowledge
which
had
already
been
gained
i
have
said
that
there
are
those
who
say
that
scott
should
have
relied
on
ski
and
dogs
if
you
read
shackleton
account
of
his
discovery
and
passage
of
the
beardmore
glacier
you
will
not
be
prejudiced
in
favour
of
dogs
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
we
found
a
much
better
way
up
than
shackleton
i
do
not
believe
it
possible
to
take
dogs
up
and
down
and
over
the
ice
disturbances
at
the
junction
with
the
plateau
unless
there
is
ample
time
to
survey
a
route
if
then
dogs
could
certainly
have
come
up
as
far
as
this
i
heard
scott
say
somewhere
under
the
cloudmaker
approximately
up
the
glacier
but
the
best
thing
you
could
do
with
dogs
in
pressure
such
as
we
all
experienced
on
our
way
down
would
be
to
drop
them
into
the
nearest
chasm
if
you
can
avoid
such
messes
well
and
good
if
not
you
must
not
rely
on
dogs
and
the
people
who
talk
of
these
things
have
no
knowledge
if
scott
was
going
up
the
beardmore
he
was
probably
right
not
to
take
dogs
actually
he
relied
on
ponies
to
the
foot
of
the
glacier
and
on
from
that
point
because
he
relied
on
ponies
he
was
not
able
to
start
before
november
the
experience
of
the
depôt
journey
showed
that
ponies
could
not
stand
the
weather
conditions
before
that
date
but
he
could
have
started
earlier
if
he
had
taken
dogs
in
place
of
ponies
to
the
foot
of
the
glacier
this
would
have
gained
him
a
few
days
in
his
race
against
the
autumn
conditions
when
returning
such
tragedies
inevitably
raise
the
question
is
it
worth
it
what
is
worth
what
is
life
worth
risking
for
a
feat
or
losing
for
your
country
to
face
a
thing
because
it
was
a
feat
and
only
a
feat
was
not
very
attractive
to
scott
it
had
to
contain
an
additional
object
knowledge
a
feat
had
even
less
attraction
for
wilson
and
it
is
a
most
noteworthy
thing
in
the
diaries
which
are
contained
in
this
book
that
he
made
no
comment
when
he
found
that
the
norwegians
were
first
at
the
pole
it
is
as
though
he
felt
that
it
did
not
really
matter
as
indeed
it
probably
did
not
it
is
most
desirable
that
some
one
should
tackle
these
and
kindred
questions
about
polar
life
there
is
a
wealth
of
matter
in
polar
psychology
there
are
unique
factors
here
especially
the
complete
isolation
and
four
months
darkness
every
year
even
in
mesopotamia
a
nation
insisted
at
last
that
adequate
arrangements
must
be
made
to
nurse
and
evacuate
the
sick
and
wounded
but
at
the
poles
a
man
must
make
up
his
mind
that
he
may
be
rotting
of
scurvy
as
evans
was
or
living
for
ten
months
on
of
seal
and
full
rations
of
ptomaine
poisoning
as
campbell
and
his
men
were
but
no
help
can
reach
him
from
the
outside
world
for
a
year
if
then
there
is
no
chance
of
a
wound
if
you
break
your
leg
on
the
beardmore
you
must
consider
the
most
expedient
way
of
committing
suicide
both
for
your
own
sake
and
that
of
your
companions
both
sexually
and
socially
the
polar
explorer
must
make
up
his
mind
to
be
starved
to
what
extent
can
hard
work
or
what
may
be
called
dramatic
imagination
provide
a
substitute
compare
our
thoughts
on
the
march
our
food
dreams
at
night
the
primitive
way
in
which
the
loss
of
a
crumb
of
biscuit
may
give
a
lasting
sense
of
grievance
night
after
night
i
bought
big
buns
and
chocolate
at
a
stall
on
the
island
platform
at
hatfield
station
but
always
woke
before
i
got
a
mouthful
to
my
lips
some
companions
who
were
not
so
highly
strung
were
more
fortunate
and
ate
their
phantom
meals
and
the
darkness
accompanied
it
may
be
almost
continually
by
howling
blizzards
which
prevent
you
seeing
your
hand
before
your
face
life
in
such
surroundings
is
both
mentally
and
physically
cramped
exercise
is
restricted
and
in
blizzards
quite
impossible
and
you
realize
how
much
you
lose
by
your
inability
to
see
the
world
about
you
when
you
are
i
am
told
that
when
confronted
by
a
lunatic
or
one
who
under
the
influence
of
some
great
grief
or
shock
contemplates
suicide
you
should
take
that
man
and
walk
him
about
nature
will
do
the
rest
to
normal
people
like
ourselves
living
under
abnormal
circumstances
nature
could
do
much
to
lift
our
thoughts
out
of
the
rut
of
everyday
affairs
but
she
loses
much
of
her
healing
power
when
she
can
not
be
seen
but
only
felt
and
when
that
feeling
is
intensely
uncomfortable
somehow
in
judging
polar
life
you
must
discount
compulsory
endurance
and
find
out
what
a
man
can
shirk
remembering
always
that
it
is
a
sledging
life
which
is
the
hardest
test
it
is
because
it
is
so
much
easier
to
shirk
in
civilization
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
standard
of
what
your
average
man
can
do
it
does
not
really
matter
much
whether
your
man
whose
work
lies
in
or
round
the
hut
shirks
a
bit
or
not
just
as
it
does
not
matter
much
in
civilization
it
is
just
rather
a
waste
of
opportunity
but
there
precious
little
shirking
in
barrier
sledging
a
week
finds
most
of
us
out
there
are
many
questions
which
ought
to
be
studied
the
effect
upon
men
of
going
from
heat
to
cold
such
as
bowers
coming
to
us

the
question
of

in

he

back
growth
and

in
hair
and
skin
there
are
many
reasons
which
send
men
to
the
poles
and
the
intellectual
force
uses
them
all
but
the
desire
for
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
is
the
one
which
really
counts
and
there
is
no
field
for
the
collection
of
knowledge
which
at
the
present
time
can
be
compared
to
the
antarctic
exploration
is
the
physical
expression
of
the
intellectual
passion
and
i
tell
you
if
you
have
the
desire
for
knowledge
and
the
power
to
give
it
physical
expression
go
out
and
explore
if
you
are
a
brave
man
you
will
do
nothing
if
you
are
fearful
you
may
do
much
for
none
but
cowards
have
need
to
prove
their
bravery
some
will
tell
you
that
you
are
mad
and
nearly
all
will
say
what
is
the
use
for
we
are
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
and
no
shopkeeper
will
look
at
research
which
does
not
promise
him
a
financial
return
within
a
year
and
so
you
will
sledge
nearly
alone
but
those
with
whom
you
sledge
will
not
be
shopkeepers
that
is
worth
a
good
deal
if
you
march
your
winter
journeys
you
will
have
your
reward
so
long
as
all
you
want
is
a

egg

modern
research
suggests
that
the
presence

absence
of
certain
vitamines
makes
a
difference
and
it
may
be
a
very
great
difference
in
the
ability
of
any
individual
to
profit
by
the
food
supplied
to
him
if
this
be
so
this
factor
must
have
had
great
influence
upon
the
fate
of
the
polar
party
whose
diet
was
seriously
deficient
in
if
not
absolutely
free
from
vitamines
the
importance
of
this
deficiency
to
the

explorer
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
and
i
suggest
that
no
future

sledge
party
can
ever
set

to

again
without

which
contains

blizzard
an
antarctic
blizzard
is
a
high
southerly
wind
generally
accompanied
by
clouds
of
drifting
snow
partly
falling
from
above
partly
picked
up
from
the
surface
in
the
daylight
of
summer
a
tent
can
not
be
seen
a
few
yards
off
in
the
darkness
of
winter
it
is
easy
to
be
lost
within
a
few
feet
of
a
hut
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
blizzard
has
a
bewildering
and
numbing
effect
upon
the
brain
of
any
one
exposed
to
it
brash
small

fragments

is

the
commonest
form
of
cloud
and
also
that
typical
of
blizzard
conditions
was
a
uniform
pall
stretching
all
over
the
sky
without
distinction
this
was
logged
by
us
as
clouds
are
the
woolly
billows
flat
below
and
rounded
on
top
which
are
formed
by
local
ascending
currents
of
air
they
were
rare
in
the
south
and
only
formed
over
open
water
or
mountains
are
the
mare
tails
and
similar
wispy
clouds
which
float
high
in
the
atmosphere
these
and
their
allied
forms
were
common
generally
speaking
the
clouds
were
due
to
stratification
of
the
air
into
layers
rather
than
to
ascending
currents
