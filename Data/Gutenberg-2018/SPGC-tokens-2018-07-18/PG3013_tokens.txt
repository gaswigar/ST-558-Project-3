birds
differs
markedly
from
all
the
other
comedies
of
aristophanes
which
have
come
down
to
us
in
subject
and
general
conception
it
is
just
an
extravaganza
pure
and
simple
a
graceful
whimsical
theme
chosen
expressly
for
the
sake
of
the
opportunities
it
afforded
of
bright
amusing
dialogue
pleasing
lyrical
interludes
and
charming
displays
of
brilliant
stage
effects
and
pretty
dresses
unlike
other
plays
of
the
same
author
there
is
here
apparently
no
serious
political
motif
underlying
the
surface
burlesque
and
buffoonery
some
critics
it
is
true
profess
to
find
in
it
a
reference
to
the
unfortunate
sicilian
expedition
then
in
progress
and
a
prophecy
of
its
failure
and
the
political
downfall
of
alcibiades
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
whole
thing
seems
rather
an
attempt
on
the
dramatist
part
to
relieve
the
overwrought
minds
of
his
anxious
and
discouraged
at
the
unsatisfactory
reports
from
before
syracuse
by
a
work
conceived
in
a
lighter
vein
than
usual
and
mainly
unconnected
with
contemporary
realities
the
play
was
produced
in
the
year
just
when
success
or
failure
in
sicily
hung
in
the
balance
though
already
the
outlook
was
gloomy
and
many
circumstances
pointed
to
impending
disaster
moreover
the
public
conscience
was
still
shocked
and
perturbed
over
the
mysterious
affair
of
the
mutilation
of
the
hermae
which
had
occurred
immediately
before
the
sailing
of
the
fleet
and
strongly
suspicious
of
alcibiades
participation
in
the
outrage
in
spite
of
the
inherent
charm
of
the
subject
the
splendid
outbursts
of
lyrical
poetry
in
some
of
the
choruses
and
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
and
costumes
birds
failed
to
win
the
first
prize
this
was
acclaimed
to
a
play
of
aristophanes
rival
amipsias
the
title
of
which
comastoe
or
seems
to
imply
that
the
chief
interest
was
derived
from
direct
allusions
to
the
outrage
above
mentioned
and
to
the
individuals
suspected
to
have
been
engaged
in
it
for
this
reason
which
militated
against
its
immediate
success
viz
the
absence
of
direct
allusion
to
contemporary
politics
there
are
of
course
incidental
references
here
and
there
to
topics
and
personages
of
the
day
the
play
appeals
perhaps
more
than
any
other
of
our
productions
to
the
modern
reader
sparkling
wit
whimsical
fancy
poetic
charm
are
of
all
ages
and
can
be
appreciated
as
readily
by
ourselves
as
by
an
athenian
audience
of
two
thousand
years
ago
though
of
course
much
is
inevitably
lost
without
the
important
adjuncts
of
music
scenery
dresses
and
what
we
may
call
generally
which
we
know
in
this
instance
to
have
been
on
the
most
magnificent
scale
the
plot
is
this
euelpides
and
pisthetaerus
two
old
athenians
disgusted
with
the
litigiousness
wrangling
and
sycophancy
of
their
countrymen
resolve
upon
quitting
attica
having
heard
of
the
fame
of
epops
the
hoopoe
sometime
called
tereus
and
now
king
of
the
birds
they
determine
under
the
direction
of
a
raven
and
a
jackdaw
to
seek
from
him
and
his
subject
birds
a
city
free
from
all
care
and
strife
arrived
at
the
palace
of
epops
they
knock
and
trochilus
the
wren
in
a
state
of
great
flutter
as
he
mistakes
them
for
fowlers
opens
the
door
and
informs
them
that
his
majesty
is
asleep
when
he
awakes
the
strangers
appear
before
him
and
after
listening
to
a
long
and
eloquent
harangue
on
the
superior
attractions
of
a
residence
among
the
birds
they
propose
a
notable
scheme
of
their
own
to
further
enhance
its
advantages
and
definitely
secure
the
sovereignty
of
the
universe
now
exercised
by
the
gods
of
olympus
the
birds
are
summoned
to
meet
in
general
council
they
come
flying
up
from
all
quarters
of
the
heavens
and
after
a
brief
during
which
they
come
near
tearing
the
two
human
envoys
to
pieces
they
listen
to
the
exposition
of
the
latters
plan
this
is
nothing
less
than
the
building
of
a
new
city
to
be
called
nephelococcygia
or
between
earth
and
heaven
to
be
garrisoned
and
guarded
by
the
birds
in
such
a
way
as
to
intercept
all
communication
of
the
gods
with
their
worshippers
on
earth
all
steam
of
sacrifice
will
be
prevented
from
rising
to
olympus
and
the
immortals
will
very
soon
be
starved
into
an
acceptance
of
any
terms
proposed
the
new
utopia
is
duly
constructed
and
the
daring
plan
to
secure
the
sovereignty
is
in
a
fair
way
to
succeed
meantime
various
quacks
and
charlatans
each
with
a
special
scheme
for
improving
things
arrive
from
earth
and
are
one
after
the
other
exposed
and
dismissed
presently
arrives
prometheus
who
informs
epops
of
the
desperate
straits
to
which
the
gods
are
by
this
time
reduced
and
advises
him
to
push
his
claims
and
demand
the
hand
of
basileia
dominion
the
handmaid
of
zeus
next
an
embassy
from
the
olympians
appears
on
the
scene
consisting
of
heracles
posidon
and
a
god
from
the
savage
regions
of
the
triballians
after
some
disputation
it
is
agreed
that
all
reasonable
demands
of
the
birds
are
to
be
granted
while
pisthetaerus
is
to
have
basileia

euelpides

you
wretch
we

we
are
exerting

only
to
return
to
the

spot
is
labour
lost

to
think
that

should
trust
to

crow
which
has
made
me
cover
more
than
a
thousand
furlongs
euelpides
and

has
torn

from

pisthetaerus
if
only
i
knew
where
we
were
euelpides
could
you
find
your
country
again
from
here
pisthetaerus
no
i
feel
quite
sure
i
could
not
any
more
than
could
execestides
find
his
f
a
stranger
who
wanted
to
pass
as
an
athenian
although
coming
originally
for
a
barbarian
country
euelpides
oh
dear
oh
dear
pisthetaerus
aye
aye
my
friend
is
indeed
the
road
of
oh
dears
we
are
following
euelpides
that
philocrates
the
played
us
a
scurvy
trick
when
he
pretended
these
two
guides
could
help
us
to
find
tereus
the
epops
who
is
a
bird
without
being
born
of
one
he
has
indeed
sold
us
this
jay
a
true
son
of
tharelides
for
an
obolus
and
this
crow
for
three
but
what
can
they
do
why
nothing
whatever
but
bite
and
scratch
what
the
matter
with
you
then
that
you
keep
opening
your
beak
do
you
want
us
to
fling
ourselves
headlong
down
these
rocks
there
is
no
road
that
way
f
a
king
of
thrace
a
son
of
ares
who
married
procne
the
daughter
of
pandion
king
of
athens
whom
he
had
assisted
against
the
megarians
he
violated
his
philomela
and
then
cut
out
her
tongue
she
nevertheless
managed
to
convey
to
her
sister
how
she
had
been
treated
they
both
agreed
to
kill
itys
whom
procne
had
borne
to
tereus
and
dished
up
the
limbs
of
his
own
son
to
the
father
at
the
end
of
the
meal
philomela
appeared
and
threw
the
child
head
upon
the
table
tereus
rushed
with
drawn
sword
upon
the
princesses
but
all
the
actors
in
this
terrible
scene
were
metamorph
o
sed
tereus
became
an
epops
hoopoe
procne
a
swallow
philomela
a
nightingale
and
itys
a
goldfinch
according
to
anacreon
and
apollodorus
it
was
procne
who
became
the
nightingale
and
philomela
the
swallow
and
this
is
the
version
of
the
tradition
followed
by
aristophanes
f
an
athenian
who
had
some
resemblance
to
a
jay
so
says
the
scholiast
at
any
rate
pisthetaerus
not
even
the
vestige
of
a
track
in
any
direction
euelpides
and
what
does
the
crow
say
about
the
road
to
follow
pisthetaerus
by
zeus
it
no
longer
croaks
the
same
thing
it
did
euelpides
and
which
way
does
it
tell
us
to
go
now
pisthetaerus
it
says
that
by
dint
of
gnawing
it
will
devour
my
fingers
euelpides
what
misfortune
is
ours
we
strain
every
nerve
to
get
to
the
birds
do
everything
we
can
to
that
end
and
we
can
not
find
our
way
yes
spectators
our
madness
is
quite
different
from
that
of
sacas
he
is
not
a
citizen
and
would
fain
be
one
at
any
cost
we
on
the
contrary
born
of
an
honourable
tribe
and
family
and
living
in
the
midst
of
our
we
have
fled
from
our
country
as
hard
as
ever
we
could
go
is
not
that
we
hate
it
we
recognize
it
to
be
great
and
rich
likewise
that
everyone
has
the
right
to
ruin
himself
but
the
crickets
only
chirrup
among
the
for
a
month
or
two
whereas
the
athenians
spend
their
whole
lives
in
chanting
forth
judgments
from
their
that
is
why
we
started
off
with
a
basket
a
and
some
myrtle
boughs
and
have
come
to
seek
a
quiet
country
in
which
to
settle
we
are
going
to
tereus
the
epops
to
learn
from
him
whether
in
his
aerial
flights
he
has
noticed
some
town
of
this
kind
f
literally
go
to
the
crows
a
proverbial
expression
equivalent
to
our
to
the
devil
f
they
leave
athens
because
of
their
hatred
of
lawsuits
and
informers
this
is
the
especial
failing
of
the
athenians
satirized
in
wasps
f
myrtle
boughs
were
used
in
sacrifices
and
the
founding
of
every
colony
was
started
by
a
sacrifice
pisthetaerus
here
look
euelpides
what
the
matter
pisthetaerus
why
the
crow
has
been
pointing
me
to
something
up
there
for
some
time
now
euelpides
and
the
jay
is
also
opening
its
beak
and
craning
its
neck
to
show
me
i
know
not
what
clearly
there
are
some
birds
about
here
we
shall
soon
know
if
we
kick
up
a
noise
to
start
them
pisthetaerus
do
you
know
what
to
do
knock
your
leg
against
this
rock
euelpides
and
you
your
head
to
double
the
noise
pisthetaerus
well
then
use
a
stone
instead
take
one
and
hammer
with
it
euelpides
good
idea
ho
there
within
slave
slave
pisthetaerus
what
that
friend
you
say
slave
to
summon
epops
it
would
be
much
better
to
shout
epops
epops
euelpides
well
then
epops
must
i
knock
again
epops
trochilus
who
there
who
calls
my
master
pisthetaerus
apollo
the
deliverer
what
an
enormous
beak
f
the
actors
wore
masks
made
to
resemble
the
birds
they
were
supposed
to
represent
trochilus
good
god
they
are
euelpides
the
mere
sight
of
him
petrifies
me
with
terror
what
a
horrible
monster
trochilus
woe
to
you
euelpides
but
we
are
not
men
trochilus
what
are
you
then
euelpides
i
am
the
fearling
an
african
bird
trochilus
you
talk
nonsense
euelpides
well
then
just
ask
it
of
my
feet
f
fear
had
had
disastrous
effects
upon
euelpides
internal
economy
and
this
his
feet
evidenced
trochilus
and
this
other
one
what
bird
is
it
pisthetaerus
i
i
am
a
cackling
from
the
land
of
the
pheasants
f
the
same
mishap
had
occurred
to
pisthetaerus
euelpides
but
you
yourself
in
the
name
of
the
gods
what
animal
are
you
trochilus
why
i
am
a
euelpides
why
have
you
been
conquered
by
a
cock
trochilus
no
but
when
my
master
was
turned
into
a
peewit
he
begged
me
to
become
a
bird
too
to
follow
and
to
serve
him
euelpides
does
a
bird
need
a
servant
then
trochilus
is
no
doubt
because
he
was
a
man
at
times
he
wants
to
eat
a
dish
of
loach
from
phalerum
i
seize
my
dish
and
fly
to
fetch
him
some
again
he
wants
some
i
seize
a
ladle
and
a
pot
and
run
to
get
it
euelpides
this
is
then
truly
a
come
trochilus
do
us
the
kindness
to
call
your
master
f
the
greek
word
for
a
wren
is
derived
from
the
same
root
as
run
trochilus
why
he
has
just
fallen
asleep
after
a
feed
of
and
a
few
grubs
euelpides
never
mind
wake
him
up
trochilus
i
an
certain
he
will
be
angry
however
i
will
wake
him
to
please
you
pisthetaerus
you
cursed
brute
why
i
am
almost
dead
with
terror
euelpides
oh
my
god
was
sheer
fear
that
made
me
lose
my
jay
pisthetaerus
ah
you
great
coward
were
you
so
frightened
that
you
let
go
your
jay
euelpides
and
did
you
not
lose
your
crow
when
you
fell
sprawling
on
the
ground
pray
tell
me
that
pisthetaerus
no
no
euelpides
where
is
it
then
pisthetaerus
it
has
flown
away
euelpides
then
you
did
not
let
it
go
oh
you
brave
fellow
epops
open
the
forest
that
i
may
go
out
f
no
doubt
there
was
some
scenery
to
represent
a
forest
besides
there
is
a
pun
intended
the
words
answering
for
and
in
greek
only
differ
slightly
in
sound
euelpides
by
heracles
what
a
creature
what
plumage
what
means
this
triple
crest
epops
who
wants
me
euelpides
the
twelve
great
gods
have
used
you
ill
meseems
epops
are
you
chaffing
me
about
my
feathers
i
have
been
a
man
strangers
euelpides
is
not
you
we
are
jeering
at
epops
at
what
then
euelpides
why
is
your
beak
that
looks
so
odd
to
us
epops
this
is
how
sophocles
outrages
me
in
his
tragedies
know
i
once
was
tereus
f
sophocles
had
written
a
tragedy
about
tereus
in
which
no
doubt
the
king
finally
appears
as
a
hoopoe
euelpides
you
were
tereus
and
what
are
you
now
a
bird
or
a
peacock
f
o
ne
would
expect
the
question
to
be
bird
or
man
are
you
a
peacock
the
hoopoe
resembles
the
peacock
inasmuch
as
both
have
crests
epops
i
am
a
bird
euelpides
then
where
are
your
feathers
for
i
do
see
them
epops
they
have
fallen
off
euelpides
through
illness
epops
no
all
birds
moult
their
feathers
you
know
every
winter
and
others
grow
in
their
place
but
tell
me
who
are
you
euelpides
we
we
are
mortals
epops
from
what
country
euelpides
from
the
land
of
the
beautiful
galleys
f
athens
epops
are
you
dicasts
f
the
athenians
were
madly
addicted
to
lawsuits
see
wasps
euelpides
no
if
anything
we
are
epops
is
that
kind
of
seed
sown
among
you
f
as
much
as
to
say
you
have
such
things
as
and
euelpides
practically
replaces
few
euelpides
you
have
to
look
hard
to
find
even
a
little
in
our
fields
epops
what
brings
you
here
euelpides
we
wish
to
pay
you
a
visit
epops
what
for
euelpides
because
you
formerly
were
a
man
like
we
are
formerly
you
had
debts
as
we
have
formerly
you
did
not
want
to
pay
them
like
ourselves
furthermore
being
turned
into
a
bird
you
have
when
flying
seen
all
lands
and
seas
thus
you
have
all
human
knowledge
as
well
as
that
of
birds
and
hence
we
have
come
to
you
to
beg
you
to
direct
us
to
some
cosy
town
in
which
one
can
repose
as
if
on
thick
coverlets
epops
and
are
you
looking
for
a
greater
city
than
athens
euelpides
no
not
a
greater
but
one
more
pleasant
to
dwell
in
epops
then
you
are
looking
for
an
aristocratic
country
euelpides
i
not
at
all
i
hold
the
son
of
scellias
in
horror
f
his
name
was
aristocrates
he
was
a
general
and
commanded
a
fleet
sent
in
aid
of
corcyra
epops
but
after
all
what
sort
of
city
would
please
you
best
euelpides
a
place
where
the
following
would
be
the
most
important
business
some
friend
would
come
knocking
at
the
door
quite
early
in
the
morning
saying
by
olympian
zeus
be
at
my
house
early
as
soon
as
you
have
bathed
and
bring
your
children
too
i
am
giving
a
nuptial
feast
so
do
fail
or
else
do
cross
my
threshold
when
i
am
in
distress
epops
ah
that
what
may
be
called
being
fond
of
hardships
and
what
say
you
pisthetaerus
my
tastes
are
similar
epops
and
they
are
pisthetaerus
i
want
a
town
where
the
father
of
a
handsome
lad
will
stop
in
the
street
and
say
to
me
reproachfully
as
if
i
had
failed
him
ah
is
this
well
done
stilbonides
you
met
my
son
coming
from
the
bath
after
the
gymnasium
and
you
neither
spoke
to
him
nor
embraced
him
nor
took
him
with
you
nor
ever
once
twitched
his
parts
would
anyone
call
you
an
old
friend
of
mine
epops
ah
wag
i
see
you
are
fond
of
suffering
but
there
is
a
city
of
delights
such
as
you
want
is
on
the
red
sea
euelpides
oh
no
not
a
where
some
fine
morning
the
salaminian
galley
can
appear
bringing
a
along
have
you
no
greek
town
you
can
propose
to
us
f
the
state
galley
which
carried
the
officials
of
the
athenian
republic
to
their
several
departments
and
brought
back
those
whose
time
had
expired
it
was
this
galley
that
was
sent
to
sicily
to
fetch
back
alcibiades
who
was
accused
of
sacrilege
epops
why
not
choose
lepreum
in
elis
for
your
settlement
euelpides
by
zeus
i
could
not
look
at
lepreum
without
disgust
because
of
melanthius
f
a
tragic
poet
who
was
a
leper
there
is
a
play
of
course
on
the
word
lepreum
epops
then
again
there
is
the
opuntian
where
you
could
live
euelpides
i
would
not
be
opuntian
for
a
talent
but
come
what
is
it
like
to
live
with
the
birds
you
should
know
pretty
well
f
an
allusion
to
opuntius
who
was
epops
why
is
not
a
disagreeable
life
in
the
first
place
one
has
no
purse
euelpides
that
does
away
with
much
roguery
epops
for
food
the
gardens
yield
us
white
sesame
poppies
and
mint
euelpides
why
is
the
life
of
the
indeed
f
the
ate
a
decorated
with
garlands
of
myrtle
poppies
and
mint
pisthetaerus
ha
i
am
beginning
to
see
a
great
plan
which
will
transfer
the
supreme
power
to
the
birds
if
you
will
but
take
my
advice
epops
take
your
advice
in
what
way
pisthetaerus
in
what
way
well
firstly
do
not
fly
in
all
directions
with
open
beak
it
is
not
dignified
among
us
when
we
see
a
thoughtless
man
we
ask
what
sort
of
bird
is
this
and
teleas
answers
is
a
man
who
has
no
brain
a
bird
that
has
lost
his
head
a
creature
you
can
not
catch
for
it
never
remains
in
any
one
place
epops
by
zeus
himself
your
jest
hits
the
mark
what
then
is
to
be
done
pisthetaerus
found
a
city
epops
we
birds
but
what
sort
of
city
should
we
build
pisthetaerus
oh
really
really
is
spoken
like
a
fool
look
down
epops
i
am
looking
pisthetaerus
now
look
upwards
epops
i
am
looking
pisthetaerus
turn
your
head
round
epops
ah
be
pleasant
for
me
if
i
end
in
twisting
my
neck
pisthetaerus
what
have
you
seen
epops
the
clouds
and
the
sky
pisthetaerus
very
well
is
not
this
the
pole
of
the
birds
then
epops
how
their
pole
pisthetaerus
or
if
you
like
it
the
land
and
since
it
turns
and
passes
through
the
whole
universe
it
is
called
if
you
build
and
fortify
it
you
will
turn
your
pole
into
a
fortified
city
in
this
way
you
will
reign
over
mankind
as
you
do
over
the
grasshoppers
and
cause
the
gods
to
die
of
rabid
hunger
f
from
the
word
meaning
turn
f
the
greek
words
for
and
only
differ
by
a
single
letter
epops
how
so
pisthetaerus
the
air
is
earth
and
heaven
when
we
want
to
go
to
delphi
we
ask
the
boeotians
for
leave
of
passage
in
the
same
way
when
men
sacrifice
to
the
gods
unless
the
latter
pay
you
tribute
you
exercise
the
right
of
every
nation
towards
strangers
and
do
allow
the
smoke
of
the
sacrifices
to
pass
through
your
city
and
territory
f
boeotia
separated
attica
from
phocis
epops
by
earth
by
snares
by
network
i
never
heard
of
anything
more
cleverly
conceived
and
if
the
other
birds
approve
i
am
going
to
build
the
city
along
with
you
f
he
swears
by
the
powers
that
are
to
him
dreadful
pisthetaerus
who
will
explain
the
matter
to
them
epops
you
must
yourself
before
i
came
they
were
quite
ignorant
but
since
i
have
lived
with
them
i
have
taught
them
to
speak
pisthetaerus
but
how
can
they
be
gathered
together
epops
easily
i
will
hasten
down
to
the
coppice
to
waken
my
dear
procne
as
soon
as
they
hear
our
voices
they
will
come
to
us
hot

as
already
stated
according
to
the
legend
accepted
by
aristophanes
it
was
procne
who
was
turned
into
the
nightengale
pisthetaerus
my
dear
bird
lose
no
time
i
beg
fly
at
once
into
the
coppice
and
awaken
procne
epops
chase
off
drowsy
sleep
dear
companion
let
the
sacred
hymn
gush
from
thy
divine
throat
in
melodious
strains
roll
forth
in
soft
cadence
your
refreshing
melodies
to
bewail
the
fate
of
itys
which
has
been
the
cause
of
so
many
tears
to
us
both
your
pure
notes
rise
through
the
thick
leaves
of
the
right
up
to
the
throne
of
zeus
where
phoebus
listens
to
you
phoebus
with
his
golden
hair
and
his
ivory
lyre
responds
to
your
plaintive
accents
he
gathers
the
choir
of
the
gods
and
from
their
immortal
lips
rushes
a
sacred
chant
of
blessed
voices
the
flute
is
played
behind
the
scene
f
the
son
of
tereus
and
procne
pisthetaerus
oh
by
zeus
what
a
throat
that
little
bird
possesses
he
has
filled
the
whole
coppice
with
melody

keep

tidings
let
all

birds
assemble
here
know
that
a
clever
old
man
has
come
to
us
bringing
an
entirely
new
idea
and
proposing
great
reforms
let
all
come
to
the
debate
here
here
here
here
torotorotorotorotix
kikkobau
kikkobau
torotorotorotorolililix
pisthetaerus
can
you
see
any
bird
euelpides
by
phoebus
no
and
yet
i
am
straining
my
eyesight
to
scan
the
sky
pisthetaerus
was
really
not
worth
epops
while
to
go
and
bury
himself
in
the
thicket
like
a
plover
when
phoenicopterus
torotina
torotina
pisthetaerus
hold
friend
here
is
another
bird
euelpides
i
faith
yes
is
a
bird
but
of
what
kind
is
it
a
peacock
pisthetaerus
epops
will
tell
us
what
is
this
bird
epops
is
not
one
of
those
you
are
used
to
seeing
is
a
bird
from
the
marshes
pisthetaerus
oh
oh
but
he
is
very
handsome
with
his
wings
as
crimson
as
flame
epops
undoubtedly
indeed
he
is
called
flamingo
f
an
african
bird
that
comes
to
the
southern
countries
of
europe
to
greece
italy
and
spain
it
is
even
seen
in
provence
euelpides
hi
i
say
you
pisthetaerus
what
are
you
shouting
for
euelpides
why
here
another
bird
pisthetaerus
aye
indeed
is
a
foreign
bird
too
what
is
this
bird
from
beyond
the
mountains
with
a
look
as
solemn
as
it
is
stupid
epops
he
is
called
the
mede
f
aristophanes
amusingly
mixes
up
real
birds
with
people
and
individuals
whom
he
represents
in
the
form
of
birds
he
is
personifying
the
medians
here
pisthetaerus
the
mede
but
by
heracles
how
if
a
mede
has
he
flown
here
without
a
camel
euelpides
here
another
bird
with
a
crest
pisthetaerus
ah
that
curious
i
say
epops
you
are
not
the
only
one
of
your
kind
then
epops
this
bird
is
the
son
of
philocles
who
is
the
son
of
epops
so
that
you
see
i
am
his
grandfather
just
as
one
might
say
hipponicus
the
son
of
callias
who
is
the
son
of
hipponicus
f
philocles
a
tragic
poet
had
written
a
tragedy
on
tereus
which
was
simply
a
plagiarism
of
the
play
of
the
same
name
by
sophocles
philocles
is
the
son
of
epops
because
he
got
his
inspiration
from
sophocles
tereus
and
at
the
same
time
is
father
to
epops
since
he
himself
produced
another
tereus
f
this
hipponicus
is
probably
the
orator
whose
ears
alcibiades
boxed
to
gain
a
bet
he
was
a
descendant
of
callias
who
was
famous
for
his
hatred
of
pisistratus
pisthetaerus
then
this
bird
is
callias
why
what
a
lot
of
his
feathers
he
has
lost
f
this
callias
who
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
foe
of
pisistratus
had
ruined
himself
epops
that
because
he
is
honest
so
the
informers
set
upon
him
and
the
women
too
pluck
out
his
feathers
pisthetaerus
by
posidon
do
you
see
that
bird
what
is
his
name
epops
this
one
is
the
glutton
pisthetaerus
is
there
another
glutton
besides
cleonymus
but
why
if
he
is
cleonymus
has
he
not
thrown
away
his
crest
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
these
crests
have
these
birds
come
to
contend
for
the
double
stadium
prize
f
cleonymus
had
cast
away
his
shield
he
was
as
great
a
glutton
as
he
was
a
coward
f
a
race
in
which
the
track
had
to
be
circled
twice
epops
they
are
like
the
carians
who
cling
to
the
crests
of
their
mountains
for
greater
safety
f
a
people
of
asia
minor
when
pursued
by
the
ionians
they
took
refuge
in
the
mountains
pisthetaerus
oh
posidon
do
you
see
what
swarms
of
birds
are
gathering
here
euelpides
by
phoebus
what
a
cloud
the
entrance
to
the
stage
is
no
longer
visible
so
closely
do
they
fly
together
pisthetaerus
here
is
the
partridge
euelpides
faith
there
is
the
francolin
pisthetaerus
there
is
the
poachard
euelpides
here
is
the
kingfisher
and
over
yonder
epops
is
the
barber
euelpides
what
a
bird
a
barber
pisthetaerus
why
sporgilus
is
one
here
comes
the
owl
f
an
athenian
barber
euelpides
and
who
is
it
brings
an
owl
to
athens
f
the
owl
was
dedicated
to
athene
and
being
respected
at
athens
it
had
greatly
multiplied
hence
the
proverb
owls
to
athens
similar
to
our
english
coals
to
newcastle
pisthetaerus
here
is
the
magpie
the
the
swallow
the
horned
owl
the
buzzard
the
pigeon
the
falcon
the
the
cuckoo
the
the
the
the
kestrel

oh
what
a
lot
of
birds
what
a
quantity
of
blackbirds
how
they
scold
how
they
come
rushing
up
what
a
noise
what
a
noise
can
they
be
bearing
us
oh
there
there
they
are
opening
their
beaks
and
staring
at
us
pisthetaerus
why
so
they
are

my
friends

titititititititi
what
good
thing
have
you
to
tell
me
epops
something
that
concerns
our
common
safety
and
that
is
just
as
pleasant
as
it
is
to
the
purpose
two
men
who
are
subtle
reasoners
have
come
here
to
seek
me
chorus
where
what
what
are
you
saying
epops
i
say
two
old
men
have
come
from
the
abode
of
men
to
propose
a
vast
and
splendid
scheme

a
horrible
crime

are
you
saying

same
plains
as
ourselves

violated
our
ancient
laws
he
has
broken
the
oaths
that
bind
all
birds
he
has
laid
a
snare
for
me
he
has
handed
us
over
to
the
attacks
of
that
impious
race
which
throughout
all
time
has
never
ceased
to
war
against
us
as
for
this
traitorous
bird
we
will
decide
his
case
later
but
the
two
old
men
shall
be
punished
forthwith
we
are
going
to
tear
them
to
pieces
pisthetaerus
is
all
over
with
us

you
are
the
sole
cause
of
all
our
trouble

you
bring
me
from
down
yonder

caution

such

not
learn
from

which
an
enemy
compels

know

the

the

then
i

hear
them

never
have
we
opposed

f
it
was
customary
when
speaking
in

and
also
at
feasts

wear
a
chaplet

the
question
euelpides
the
guests
wore
chaplets
of
flowers
herbs
and
leaves
which
had
the
property
of
being
refreshing
euelpides
is
it
a
question
of
feasting
what
does
it
all
mean
pisthetaerus
by
zeus
no
but
i
am
hunting
for
fine
tasty
words
to
break
down
the
hardness
of
their
i
grieve
so
much
for
you
who
at
one
time
were
kings
chorus
we
kings
over
whom
pisthetaerus
of
all
that
exists
firstly
of
me
and
of
this
man
even
of
zeus
himself
your
race
is
older
than
saturn
the
titans
and
the
earth
chorus
what
older
than
the
earth
pisthetaerus
by
phoebus
yes
chorus
by
zeus
but
i
never
knew
that
before
pisthetaerus
is
because
you
are
ignorant
and
heedless
and
have
never
read
your
aesop
is
he
who
tells
us
that
the
lark
was
born
before
all
other
creatures
indeed
before
the
earth
his
father
died
of
sickness
but
the
earth
did
not
exist
then
he
remained
unburied
for
five
days
when
the
bird
in
its
dilemma
decided
for
want
of
a
better
place
to
entomb
its
father
in
its
own
head
euelpides
so
that
the
lark
father
is
buried
at
cephalae
f
a
deme
of
attica
in
greek
the
word
also
means
and
hence
the
pun
epops
hence
if
we
existed
before
the
earth
before
the
gods
the
kingship
belongs
to
us
by
right
of
priority
euelpides
undoubtedly
but
sharpen
your
beak
well
zeus
wo
be
in
a
hurry
to
hand
over
his
sceptre
to
the
woodpecker
pisthetaerus
it
was
not
the
gods
but
the
birds
who
were
formerly
the
masters
and
kings
over
men
of
this
i
have
a
thousand
proofs
first
of
all
i
will
point
you
to
the
cock
who
governed
the
persians
before
all
other
monarchs
before
darius
and
megabyzus
is
in
memory
of
his
reign
that
he
is
called
the
persian
bird
f
one
of
darius
best
generals
after
his
expedition
against
the
scythians
this
prince
gave
him
the
command
of
the
army
which
he
left
in
europe
megabyzus
took
perinthos
afterwards
called
heraclea
and
conquered
thrace
euelpides
for
this
reason
also
even
he
alone
of
all
the
birds
wears
his
tiara
straight
on
his
head
like
the
great
king
f
all
persians
wore
the
tiara
but
always
on
one
side
the
great
king
alone
wore
it
straight
on
his
head
pisthetaerus
he
was
so
strong
so
great
so
feared
that
even
now
on
account
of
his
ancient
power
everyone
jumps
out
of
bed
as
soon
as
ever
he
crows
at
daybreak
blacksmiths
potters
tanners
shoemakers

and
armourers
all
put
on
their
shoes
and
go
to
work
before
it
is
daylight
euelpides
i
can
tell
you
something
about
that
was
the
cock
fault
that
i
lost
a
splendid
tunic
of
phrygian
wool
i
was
at
a
feast
in
town
given
to
celebrate
the
birth
of
a
child
i
had
drunk
pretty
freely
and
had
just
fallen
asleep
when
a
cock
i
suppose
in
a
greater
hurry
than
the
rest
began
to
crow
i
thought
it
was
dawn
and
set
out
for
alimos
i
had
hardly
got
beyond
the
walls
when
a
footpad
struck
me
in
the
back
with
his
bludgeon
down
i
went
and
wanted
to
shout
but
he
had
already
made
off
with
my
mantle
f
noted
as
the
birthplace
of
thucydides
a
deme
of
attica
of
the
tribe
of
leontis
demosthenes
tells
us
it
was
stadia
from
athens
pisthetaerus
formerly
also
the
kite
was
ruler
and
king
over
the
greeks
epops
the
greeks
pisthetaerus
and
when
he
was
king
was
he
who
first
taught
them
to
fall
on
their
knees
before
the
kites
f
the
appearance
of
the
kite
in
greece
betokened
the
return
of
springtime
it
was
therefore
worshipped
as
a
symbol
of
that
season
euelpides
by
zeus
is
what
i
did
myself
one
day
on
seeing
a
kite
but
at
the
moment
i
was
on
my
knees
and
leaning
backwards
with
mouth
agape
i
bolted
an
obolus
and
was
forced
to
carry
my
bag
home
empty
f
to
look
at
the
kite
who
no
doubt
was
flying
high
in
the
sky
f
as
already
shown
the
athenians
were
addicted
to
carrying
small
coins
in
their
this
obolus
was
for
the
purpose
of
buying
flour
to
fill
the
bag
he
was
carrying
pisthetaerus
the
cuckoo
was
king
of
egypt
and
of
the
whole
of
phoenicia
when
he
called
out
cuckoo
all
the
phoenicians
hurried
to
the
fields
to
reap
their
wheat
and
their
barley
f
in
phoenicia
and
egypt
the
cuckoo
makes
its
appearance
about
euelpides
hence
no
doubt
the
proverb
cuckoo
cuckoo
go
to
the
fields
ye
circumcised
f
this
was
an
egyptian
proverb
meaning
the
cuckoo
sings
we
go
harvesting
both
the
phoenicians
and
the
egyptians
practised
circumcision
pisthetaerus
so
powerful
were
the
birds
that
the
kings
of
grecian
cities
agamemnon
menelaus
for
instance
carried
a
bird
on
the
tip
of
their
sceptres
who
had
his
share
of
all
presents
f
the
staff
called
a
sceptre
generally
terminated
in
a
piece
of
carved
work
representing
a
flower
a
fruit
and
most
often
a
bird
euelpides
that
i
did
know
and
was
much
astonished
when
i
saw
priam
come
upon
the
stage
in
the
tragedies
with
a
bird
which
kept
watching
lysicrates
to
see
if
he
got
any
present
f
a
general
accused
of
treachery
the
bird
watches
lysicrates
because
according
to
pisthetaerus
he
had
a
right
to
a
share
of
the
presents
pisthetaerus
but
the
strongest
proof
of
all
is
that
zeus
who
now
reigns
is
represented
as
standing
with
an
eagle
on
his
head
as
a
symbol
of
his
royalty
his
daughter
has
an
owl
and
phoebus
as
his
servant
has
a
hawk
f
it
is
thus
that
phidias
represents
his
olympian
zeus
euelpides
by
demeter
is
well
spoken
but
what
are
all
these
birds
doing
in
heaven
pisthetaerus
when
anyone
sacrifices
and
according
to
the
rite
offers
the
entrails
to
the
gods
these
birds
take
their
share
before
zeus
formerly
men
always
swore
by
the
birds
and
never
by
the
gods
even
now
lampon
swears
by
the
goose
when
he
wants
to
lie
is
clear
that
you
were
great
and
sacred
but
now
you
are
looked
upon
as
slaves
as
fools
as
helots

are
thrown
at
you
as
at
raving
madmen

crowd
of

you
are
sold
in
heaps
and
the
buyers

you
over
to
be

are

would

up

into
a
mixture
of

to
which
another
sweet
and
greasy
sauce
is
added
and
the
whole
is

man
your
words
have
made
my
heart
bleed
i
have
groaned
over
the
treachery
of
our
fathers
who
knew
not
how
to
transmit
to
us
the
high
rank
they
held
from
their

but
is
a
benevolent
genius
a
happy
fate
that
sends
you
to
us

shall
be
our
deliverer
and
i
place
the
destiny
of
my
little
ones
and
my
own
in
your
hands
with
every
confidence
but
hasten
to
tell
me
what
must
be
done
we
should
not
be
worthy
to
live
if
we
did
not
seek
to
regain
our
royalty
by
every
possible
means
pisthetaerus
first
i
advise
that
the
birds
gather
together
in
one
city
and
that
they
build
a
wall
of
great
bricks
like
that
at
babylon
round
the
plains
of
the
air
and
the
whole
region
of
space
that
divides
earth
from
heaven
epops
oh
cebriones
oh
porphyrion
what
a
terribly
strong
place
f
as
if
he
were
saying
oh
gods
like
lampon
he
swears
by
the
birds
instead
of
swearing
by
the
the
names
of
these
birds
are
those
of
two
of
the
titans
pisthetaerus
th
en
this
being
well
done
and
completed
you
demand
back
the
empire
from
zeus
if
he
will
not
agree
if
he
refuses
and
does
not
at
once
confess
himself
beaten
you
declare
a
sacred
war
against
him
and
forbid
the
gods
henceforward
to
pass
through
your
country
with
lust
as
hitherto
for
the
purpose
of
fondling
their
alcmenas
their
alopes
or
their
semeles
if
they
try
to
pass
through
you
infibulate
them
with
rings
so
that
they
can
work
no
longer
you
send
another
messenger
to
mankind
who
will
proclaim
to
them
that
the
birds
are
kings
that
for
the
future
they
must
first
of
all
sacrifice
to
them
and
only
afterwards
to
the
gods
that
it
is
fitting
to
appoint
to
each
deity
the
bird
that
has
most
in
common
with
it
for
instance
are
they
sacrificing
to
aphrodite
let
them
at
the
same
time
offer
barley
to

immolating

to

amphitryon
king
of
thebes
and
mother
of
semele
the
daughter
of
cadmus
and
hermione
and
mother
of
bacchus
both
seduced
by
alope
daughter
of
cercyon
a
robber
who
reigned
at
eleusis
and
was
conquered
by
perseus
alope
was
honoured
with
posidon
caresses
by
him
she
had
a
son
named
hippothous
at
first
brought
up
by
shepherds
but
who
afterwards
was
restored
to
the
throne
of
his
grandfather
by
theseus
f
because
water
is
the
duck
domain
as
it
is
that
of
posidon
f
because
the
gull
like
heracles
is
voracious
f
the
germans
still
call
it
and
the
french
both
names
thus
containing
the
idea
of
euelpides
this
notion
of
an
immolated
gnat
delights
me
and
now
let
the
great
zeus
thunder
epops
but
how
will
mankind
recognize
us
as
gods
and
not
as
jays
us
who
have
wings
and
fly
pisthetaerus
you
talk
rubbish
hermes
is
a
god
and
has
wings
and
flies
and
so
do
many
other
gods
first
of
all
victory
flies
with
golden
wings
eros
is
undoubtedly
winged
too
and
iris
is
compared
by
homer
to
a
timorous
dove
if
men
in
their
blindness
do
not
recognize
you
as
gods
and
continue
to
worship
the
dwellers
in
olympus
then
a
cloud
of
sparrows
greedy
for
corn
must
descend
upon
their
fields
and
eat
up
all
their
seeds
we
shall
see
then
if
demeter
will
mete
them
out
any
wheat
f
the
scholiast
draws
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
homer
says
this
of
here
and
not
of
iris
iliad
v
it
is
only
another
proof
that
the
text
of
homer
has
reached
us
in
a
corrupted
form
or
it
may
be
that
aristophanes
was
liable
like
other
people
to
occasional
mistakes
of
quotation
euelpides
by
zeus
she
take
good
care
she
does
not
and
you
will
see
her
inventing
a
thousand
excuses
pisthetaerus
the
crows
too
will
prove
your
divinity
to
them
by
pecking
out
the
eyes
of
their
flocks
and
of
their
and
then
let
apollo
cure
them
since
he
is
a
physician
and
is
paid
for
the
purpose
f
in
sacrifices
euelpides
oh
do
do
that
wait
first
until
i
have
sold
my
two
young
bullocks
pisthetaerus
if
on
the
other
hand
they
recognize
that
you
are
god
the
principle
of
life
that
you
are
earth
saturn
posidon
they
shall
be
loaded
with
benefits
epops
name
me
one
of
these
then
pisthetaerus
firstly
the
locusts
shall
not
eat
up
their
a
legion
of
owls
and
kestrels
will
devour
them
moreover
the
gnats
and
the
shall
no
longer
ravage
the
figs
a
flock
of
thrushes
shall
swallow
the
whole
host
down
to
the
very
last
epops
and
how
shall
we
give
wealth
to
mankind
this
is
their
strongest
passion
pisthetaerus
when
they
consult
the
omens
you
will
point
them
to
the
richest
mines
you
will
reveal
the
paying
ventures
to
the
diviner
and
not
another
shipwreck
will
happen
or
sailor
perish
epops
no
more
shall
perish
how
is
that
pisthetaerus
when
the
auguries
are
examined
before
starting
on
a
voyage
some
bird
will
not
fail
to
say
do
start
there
will
be
a
storm
or
else
go
you
will
make
a
most
profitable
venture
euelpides
i
shall
buy
a
and
go
to
sea
i
will
not
stay
with
you
pisthetaerus
you
will
discover
treasures
to
them
which
were
buried
in
former
times
for
you
know
them
do
not
all
men
say
none
knows
where
my
treasure
lies
unless
perchance
it
be
some
bird
f
an
athenian
proverb
euelpides
i
shall
sell
my
boat
and
buy
a
spade
to
unearth
the
vessels
epops
and
how
are
we
to
give
them
health
which
belongs
to
the
gods
pisthetaerus
if
they
are
happy
is
not
that
the
chief
thing
towards
health
the
miserable
man
is
never
well
epops
old
age
also
dwells
in
olympus
how
will
they
get
at
it
must
they
die
in
early
youth
pisthetaerus
why
the
birds
by
zeus
will
add
three
hundred
years
to
their
life
epops
from
whom
will
they
take
them
pisthetaerus
from
whom
why
from
themselves
do
you
know
the
cawing
crow
lives
five
times
as
long
as
a
man
euelpides
ah
ah
these
are
far
better
kings
for
us
than
zeus
pisthetaerus
far
better
are
they
not
and
firstly
we
shall
not
have
to
build
them
temples
of
hewn
stone
closed
with
gates
of
gold
they
will
dwell
amongst
the
bushes
and
in
the
thickets
of
green
oak
the
most
venerated
of
birds
will
have
no
other
temple
than
the
foliage
of
the
olive
tree
we
shall
not
go
to
delphi
or
to
ammon
to
sacrifice
but
standing
erect
in
the
midst
of
arbutus
and
wild
olives
and
holding
forth
our
hands
filled
with
wheat
and
barley
we
shall
pray
them
to
admit
us
to
a
share
of
the
blessings
they
enjoy
and
shall
at
once
obtain
them
for
a
few
grains
of
wheat
f
a
celebrated
temple
to
zeus
in
an
oasis
of
libya

come
here
so
that
we
may
contemplate
the
nightingale
f
it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
according
to
the
legend
followed
by
aristophanes
procne
had
been
changed
into
a
nightingale
and
philomela
into
a
swallow
epops
let

be
as
you
desire
come

procne

strangers
pisthetaerus
oh
great
zeus

a
beautiful
little
bird
what
a
dainty
form
what
brilliant
plumage
f
the
actor
representing
procne
was
dressed
out
as
a
courtesan
but
wore
a
mask
of
a
bird
euelpides
do
you
know
how
dearly
i
should
like
to
splint
her
legs
for
her
pisthetaerus
she
is
dazzling
all
over
with
gold
like
a
young
girl
f
young
unmarried
girls
wore
golden
ornaments
the
apparel
of
married
women
was
much
simpler
euelpides
oh
how
i
should
like
to
kiss
her
pisthetaerus
why
wretched
man
she
has
two
little
sharp
points
on
her
beak
euelpides
i
would
treat
her
like
an
egg
the
shell
of
which
we
remove
before
eating
it
i
would
take
off
her
mask
and
then
kiss
her
pretty
face
epops
let
us
go
in
pisthetaerus
lead
the
way
and
may
success
attend
us
chorus
lovable
golden
bird
whom
i
cherish
above
all
others
you
whom
i
associate
with
all
my
songs
nightingale
you
have
come
you
have
come
to
show
yourself
to
me
and
to
charm
me
with
your
notes
come
you
who
play
spring
melodies
upon
the
harmonious
flute
lead
off
our
anapaests
weak
mortals
chained
to
the
earth
creatures
of
clay
as
frail
as
the
foliage
of
the
woods
you
unfortunate
race
whose
life
is
but
darkness
as
unreal
as
a
shadow
the
illusion
of
a
dream
hearken
to
us
who
are
immortal
beings
ethereal
ever
young
and
occupied
with
eternal
thoughts
for
we
shall
teach
you
about
all
celestial
matters
you
shall
know
thoroughly
what
is
the
nature
of
the
birds
what
the
origin
of
the
gods
of
the
rivers
of
erebus
and
chaos
thanks
to
us
even
prodicus
will
envy
you
your
knowledge
at
the
beginning
there
was
only
chaos
night
dark
erebus
and
deep
tartarus
earth
the
air
and
heaven
had
no
existence
firstly
night
laid
a
germless
egg
in
the
bosom
of
the
infinite
deeps
of
erebus
and
from
this
after
the
revolution
of
long
ages
sprang
the
graceful
eros
with
his
glittering
golden
wings
swift
as
the
whirlwinds
of
the
tempest
he
mated
in
deep
tartarus
with
dark
chaos
winged
like
himself
and
thus
hatched
forth
our
race
which
was
the
first
to
see
the
light
that
of
the
immortals
did
not
exist
until
eros
had
brought
together
all
the
ingredients
of
the
world
and
from
their
marriage
heaven
ocean
earth
and
the
imperishable
race
of
blessed
gods
sprang
into
being
thus
our
origin
is
very
much
older
than
that
of
the
dwellers
in
olympus
we
are
the
offspring
of
eros
there
are
a
thousand
proofs
to
show
it
we
have
wings
and
we
lend
assistance
to
lovers
how
many
handsome
youths
who
had
sworn
to
remain
insensible
have
not
been
vanquished
by
our
power
and
have
yielded
themselves
to
their
lovers
when
almost
at
the
end
of
their
youth
being
led
away
by
the
gift
of
a
quail
a
waterfowl
a
goose
or
a
cock
and
what
important
services
do
not
the
birds
render
to
mortals
first
of
all
they
mark
the
seasons
for
them
springtime
winter
and
autumn
does
the
screaming
crane
migrate
to
libya
it
warns
the
husbandman
to
sow
the
pilot
to
take
his
ease
beside
his
tiller
hung
up
in
his
dwelling
and
orestes
to
weave
a
tunic
so
that
the
rigorous
cold
may
not
drive
him
any
more
to
strip
other
folk
when
the
kite
reappears
he
tells
of
the
return
of
spring
and
of
the
period
when
the
fleece
of
the
sheep
must
be
clipped
is
the
swallow
in
sight
all
hasten
to
sell
their
warm
tunic
and
to
buy
some
light
clothing
we
are
your
ammon
delphi
dodona
your
phoebus
apollo
before
undertaking
anything
whether
a
business
transaction
a
marriage
or
the
purchase
of
food
you
consult
the
birds
by
reading
the
omens
and
you
give
this
name
of
omen
to
all
signs
that
tell
of
the
future
with
you
a
word
is
an
omen
you
call
a
sneeze
an
omen
a
meeting
an
omen

unknown
sound
an
omen

slave
or
an

omen

it
not
clear
that
we
are
a
prophetic
apollo
to
you
if
you
recognize
us
as
gods
we
shall
be
your
divining

through
us

will
know

winter

temperate
months

shall
not
withdraw
ourselves
to

most
priceless
gift

was
an
oracle
in
the
temple
of
zeus
there
was
surrounded
by
a
dense
forest
all
the
trees
of
which
were
endowed
with
the
gift
of
prophecy
both
the
sacred
oaks
and
the
pigeons
that
lived
in
them
answered
the
questions
of
those
who
came
to
consult
the
oracle
in
pure
greek
f
the
greek
word
for
is
the
same
as
that
for
f
a
satire
on
the
passion
of
the
greeks
for
seeing
an
omen
in
everything
f
an
imitation
of
the
nightingale
song
f
god
of
the
groves
and
wilds
f
the
of
the
gods
roaming
the
mountains
she
held
dances
always
attended
by
pan
and
his
accompanying
rout
of
fauns
and
satyrs
f
an
allusion
to
the
birds
are
armed
with
brazen
spurs
f
an
allusion
to
the
spots
on
this
bird
which
resemble
the
scars
left
by
a
branding
iron
f
he
was
of
asiatic
origin
but
wished
to
pass
for
an
athenian
f
or
philamnon
king
of
thrace
the
scholiast
remarks
that
the
phrygians
and
the
thracians
had
a
common
origin
f
the
greek
word
here
is
also
the
name
of
a
little
bird
f
a
who
had
become
the
phylarchs
were
the
headmen
of
the
tribes
they
presided
at
the
private
assemblies
and
were
charged
with
the
management
of
the
the
hipparchs
as
the
name
implies
were
the
leaders
of
the
cavalry
there
were
only
two
of
these
in
the
athenian
army
f
he
had
become
a
senator
pisthetaerus
halloa
what
this
by
zeus
i
never
saw
anything
so
funny
in
all
my
life
f
pisthetaerus
and
euelpides
now
both
return
with
wings
euelpides
what
makes
you
laugh
pisthetaerus
is
your
bits
of
wings
know
what
you
look
like
like
a
goose
painted
by
some
euelpides
and
you
look
like
a
blackbird
pisthetaerus
is
ourselves
asked
for
this
transformation
and
as
aeschylus
has
it
these
are
no
borrowed
feathers
but
truly
our
own
f
meaning
is
we
who
wanted
to
have
these
the
verse
from
aeschylus
quoted
here
is
taken
from
myrmidons
a
tragedy
of
which
only
a
few
fragments
remain
epops
come
now
what
must
be
done
pisthetaerus
first
give
our
city
a
great
and
famous
name
then
sacrifice
to
the
gods
euelpides
i
think
so
too
epops
let
see
what
shall
our
city
be
called
pisthetaerus
will
you
have
a
laconian
name
shall
we
call
it
sparta
euelpides
what
call
my
town
sparta
why
i
would
not
use
esparto
for
my
bed
even
though
i
had
nothing
but
bands
of
rushes
f
the
greek
word
signified
the
city
of
sparta
and
also
a
kind
of
broom
used
for
weaving
rough
matting
which
served
for
the
beds
of
the
very
poor
pisthetaerus
well
then
what
name
can
you
suggest
euelpides
some
name
borrowed
from
the
clouds
from
these
lofty
regions
in
which
we
dwell
in
short
some
name
pisthetaerus
do
you
like
nephelococcygia
f
a
fanciful
name
constructed
from
the
word
for
a
cloud
and
the
word
for
a
cuckoo
thus
a
city
of
clouds
and
is
a
clever
approximation
in
german
perhaps
is
the
best
english
equivalent
epops
oh
capital
truly
is
a
brilliant
thought
euelpides
is
it
in
nephelococcygia
that
all
the
wealth
of
theovenes
and
most
of
aeschines
is
f
he
was
a
boaster
nicknamed
because
he
promised
a
great
deal
and
never
kept
his
word
f
also
mentioned
in
wasps
pisthetaerus
no
is
rather
the
plain
of
phlegra
where
the
gods
withered
the
pride
of
the
sons
of
the
earth
with
their
shafts
f
because
the
war
of
the
titans
against
the
gods
was
only
a
fiction
of
the
poets
euelpides
oh
what
a
splendid
city
but
what
god
shall
be
its
patron
for
whom
shall
we
weave
the
peplus
f
a
sacred
cloth
with
which
the
statue
of
athene
in
the
acropolis
was
draped
pisthetaerus
why
not
choose
athene
polias
f
meaning
to
be
of
the
city
athene
had
a
temple
of
this
name
euelpides
oh
what
a
town
be
to
have
a
female
deity
armed
from
head
to
foot
while
clisthenes
was
spinning
f
an
athenian
effeminate
frequently
ridiculed
by
aristophanes
pisthetaerus
who
then
shall
guard
the
pelargicon
f
this
was
the
name
of
the
wall
surrounding
the
acropolis
epops
one
of
us
a
bird
of
persian
strain
who
is
everywhere
proclaimed
to
be
the
bravest
of
all
a
true
chick
of
ares
f
the
fighting
cock
euelpides
oh
noble
chick
what
a
god
for
a
rocky
home
pisthetaerus
come
into
the
air
with
you
to
help
the
workers

are
building

up

smouldering
beneath
the
ashes
go
round

then
d
i
spatch

the
other
to
mankind
on

and
come
back
here
f
to
waken
the
sentinels
who
might
else
have
fallen
there
are
several
merry
contradictions
in
the
various
parts
of
this
list
of
injunctions
euelpides
as
for
yourself

here

may
the
plague
take

troublesome

a
slave

you
wear
your

fact
is
all
we

assiduous
slaves
of
the
muses

truth
your
little
cloak
is
quite
holy
too
through
zeal
but
poet
what
ill
wind
drove
you
here

i
have
composed
verses
in
honour
of
your
nephelococcygia
a
host
of
splendid
dithyrambs

parthenians
worthy
of
simonides
himself
f
verses
sung
by

when
did
you
compose
them
how
long
since

oh
is
long
aye
very
long
that
i
have
sung
in
honour
of
this
city

i
am
only
celebrating
its
foundation
with
this
sacrifice
i
have
only
just
named
it
as
is
done
with
little
babies
f
this
ceremony
took
place
on

tenth
day
after
birth

may
be
styled
the

the
chargers
fly

to
me

what
a
pest
is
impossible
then
to
be
rid
of
him

take
the
lustral
water
and
circle
the
altar
priest
let
all
keep
silence
a
prophet
let
not
the
goat
be
sacrificed
f
which
the
priest
was
preparing
to
sacrifice
pisthetaerus
who
are
you
prophet
who
am
i
a
prophet
pisthetaerus
get
you
gone
prophet
wretched
man
insult
not
sacred
things
for
there
is
an
oracle
of
bacis
which
exactly
applies
to
nephelococcygia
pisthetaerus
why
did
you
not
reveal
it
to
me
before
i
founded
my
city
prophet
the
divine
spirit
was
against
it
pisthetaerus
well
is
best
to
know
the
terms
of
the
oracle
prophet
but
when
the
wolves
and
the
white
crows
shall
dwell
together
between
corinth
and
sicyon
pisthetaerus
but
how
do
the
corinthians
concern
me
prophet
is
the
regions
of
the
air
that
bacis
indicated
in
this
manner
they
must
first
sacrifice
a
goat
to
pandora
and
give
the
prophet
who
first
reveals
my
words
a
good
cloak
and
new
sandals
pisthetaerus
are
the
sandals
there
prophet
read
and
besides
this
a
goblet
of
wine
and
a
good
share
of
the
entrails
of
the
victim
pisthetaerus
of
the
entrails
is
it
so
written
prophet
read
if
you
do
as
i
command
divine
youth
you
shall
be
an
eagle
among
the
clouds
if
not
you
shall
be
neither
nor
eagle
nor
woodpecker
pisthetaerus
is
all
that
there
prophet
read
pisthetaerus
this
oracle
in
no
sort
of
way
resembles
the
one
apollo
dictated
to
me
if
an
impostor
comes
without
invitation
to
annoy
you
during
the
sacrifice
and
to
demand
a
share
of
the
victim
apply
a
stout
stick
to
his
ribs
prophet
you
are
drivelling
pisthetaerus
and
do
spare
him
were
he
an
eagle
from
out
of
the
clouds
were
it
lampon
himself
or
the
great
diopithes
f
noted
athenian
diviner
who
when
the
power
was
still
shared
between
thucydides
and
pericles
predicted
that
it
would
soon
be
centred
in
the
hands
of
the
latter
his
ground
for
this
prophecy
was
the
sight
of
a
ram
with
a
single
horn
f
no
doubt
another
athenian
diviner
and
possibly
the
same
person
whom
aristophanes
names
in
knights
and
wasps
as
being
a
thief
prophet
is
all
that
there
pisthetaerus
here
read
it
yourself
and
go
and
hang
yourself

i
am

quiet

you
take
me
for
a
lydian
or
a
phrygian

think
to
frighten
me
with
your
big
words
know
that
if
zeus
worries
me
again
i
shall
go
at
the
head
of
my
eagles
who
are
armed
with
lightning
and
reduce
his
dwelling
and
that
of
amphion
to
cinders
i
shall
send
more
than
six
hundred
porphyrions
clothed
in
leopards
skins
up
to
heaven
against
him
and
formerly
a
single
porphyrion
gave
him
enough
to
do

for
you
his
messenger
if
you
annoy
me
i
shall
begin
by
stretching
your
legs
asunder
and
so
conduct
myself
iris
though
you
be
that
despite
my
age
you
will
be
astonished
i
will
show
you
something
that
will
make
you
three
times
over
f
for
a
poltroon
like
the
slaves
most
of
whom
came
to
athens
from
these
countries
f
a
parody
of
a
passage
in
the
lost
tragedy
of
of
aeschylus
f
because
this
bird
has
a
spotted
porphyrion

also
the
name
of
one
of
the
titans

tried
to
storm
heave

may
you
perish
you
wretch
you
and
your
infamous
words
pisthetaerus
wo
you
be
off
quickly
come
stretch
your
wings
or
look
out
for
squalls
iris
if
my
father
does
not
punish
you
for
your
insults
pisthetaerus
ha
but
just
you
be
off
elsewhere
to
roast
younger
folk
than
us
with
your
lightning
chorus
we
forbid
the
gods
the
sons
of
zeus
to
pass
through
our
city
and
the
mortals
to
send
them
the
smoke
of
their
sacrifices
by
this
road
pisthetaerus
is
odd
that
the
messenger
we
sent
to
the
mortals
has
never
returned
herald
oh
blessed
pisthetaerus
very
wise
very
illustrious
very
gracious
thrice
happy
very
come
prompt
me
somebody
do
pisthetaerus
get
to
your
story
herald
all
peoples
are
filled
with
admiration
for
your
wisdom
and
they
award
you
this
golden
crown
pisthetaerus
i
accept
it
but
tell
me
why
do
the
people
admire
me
herald
oh
you
who
have
founded
so
illustrious
a
city
in
the
air
you
know
not
in
what
esteem
men
hold
you
and
how
many
there
are
who
burn
with
desire
to
dwell
in
it
before
your
city
was
built
all
men
had
a
mania
for
sparta
long
hair
and
fasting
were
held
in
honour
men
went
dirty
like
socrates
and
carried
staves
now
all
is
changed
firstly
as
soon
as
is
dawn
they
all
spring
out
of
bed
together
to
go
and
seek
their
food
the
same
as
you
do
then
they
fly
off
towards
the
notices
and
finally
devour
the
decrees
the
is
so
clear
that
many
actually
bear
the
names
of
birds
there
is
a
halting
victualler
who
styles
himself
the
partridge
menippus
calls
himself
the
swallow
opuntius
the
crow
philocles
the
lark
theogenes
the
lycurgus
the
ibis
chaerephon
the
bat
syracosius
the
magpie
midias
the
quail
indeed
he
looks
like
a
quail
that
has
been
hit
hard
over
the
head
out
of
love
for
the
birds
they
repeat
all
the
songs
which
concern
the
swallow
the
teal
the
goose
or
the
pigeon
in
each
verse
you
see
wings
or
at
all
events
a
few
feathers
this
is
what
is
happening
down
there
finally
there
are
more
than
ten
thousand
folk
who
are
coming
here
from
earth
to
ask
you
for
feathers
and
hooked
claws
so
mind
you
supply
yourself
with
wings
for
the
immigrants
f
all
these
surnames
bore
some
relation
to
the
character
or
the
build
of
the
individual
to
whom
the
poet
applies
chaerephon
socrates
disciple
was
of
white
and
ashen
opuntius
was
syracosius
was
a
midias
had
a
passion
for
and
besides
resembled
that
bird
physically
pisthetaerus
ah
by
zeus
is
not
the
time
for
idling
go
as
quick
as
possible
and
fill
every
hamper
every
basket
you
can
find
with
wings
manes
will
bring
them
to
me
outside
the
walls
where
i
will
welcome
those
who
present
themselves
f
pisthetaerus
servant
already
mentioned
chorus
this
town
will
soon
be
inhabited
by
a
crowd
of
men
pisthetaerus
if
fortune
favours
us
chorus
folk
are
more
and
more
delighted
with
it
pisthetaerus
come
hurry
up
and
bring
them
along
chorus
will
not
man
find
here
everything
that
can
please
him
wisdom
love
the
divine
graces
the
sweet
face
of
gentle
peace
pisthetaerus
oh
you
lazy
servant
wo
you
hurry
yourself
chorus
let
a
basket
of
wings
be
brought
speedily
come
beat
him
as
i
do
and
put
some
life
into
him
he
is
as
lazy
as
an
ass
pisthetaerus
aye
manes
is
a
great
craven
chorus
begin
by
putting
this
heap
of
wings
in
order
divide
them
in
three
parts
according
to
the
birds
from
whom
they
came
the
singing
the
prophetic
and
the
aquatic
birds
then
you
must
take
care
to
distribute
them
to
the
men
according
to
their
character
f
from
the
inspection
of
which
auguries
were
taken
the
eagles
the
vultures
the
crows
pisthetaerus
to
manes
oh
by
the
kestrels
i
can
keep
my
hands
off
you
no
longer
you
are
too
slow
and
lazy
altogether
a
parricide
oh
might
i
but
become
an
eagle
who
soars
in
the
skies
oh
might
i
fly
above
the
azure
waves
of
the
barren
sea
f
or
rather
a
young
man
who
contemplated
parricide
f
a
parody
of
verses
in
sophocles
pisthetaerus
ha
seem
the
news
was
true
i
hear
someone
coming
who
talks
of
wings
parricide
nothing
is
more
charming
than
to
fly
i
burn
with
desire
to
live
under
the
same
laws
as
the
birds
i
am
and
fly
towards
you
for
i
want
to
live
with
you
and
to
obey
your
laws
pisthetaerus
which
laws
the
birds
have
many
laws
parricide
all
of
them
but
the
one
that
pleases
me
most
is
that
among
the
birds
it
is
considered
a
fine
thing
to
peck
and
strangle
father
pisthetaerus
aye
by
zeus
according
to
us
he
who
dares
to
strike
his
father
while
still
a
chick
is
a
brave
fellow
parricide
and
therefore
i
want
to
dwell
here
for
i
want
to
strangle
my
father
and
inherit
his
wealth
pisthetaerus
but
we
have
also
an
ancient
law
written
in
the
code
of
the
storks
which
runs
thus
when
the
stork
father
has
reared
his
young
and
has
taught
them
to
fly
the
young
must
in
their
turn
support
the
father
parricide
is
hardly
worth
while
coming
all
this
distance
to
be
compelled
to
keep
my
father
pisthetaerus
no
no
young
friend
since
you
have
come
to
us
with
such
willingness
i
am
going
to
give
you
these
black
wings
as
though
you
were
an
orphan
bird
furthermore
some
good
advice
that
i
received
myself
in
infancy
do
strike
your
father
but
take
these
wings
in
one
hand
and
these
spurs
in
the
other
imagine
you
have
a
cock
crest
on
your
head
and
go
and
mount
guard
and
fight
live
on
your
pay
and
respect
your
father
life
you
a
gallant
fellow
very
well
then
fly
to
thrace
and
fight
f
the
athenians
were
then
besieging
amphipolis
in
the
thracian
chalcidice
parricide
by
bacchus
is
well
spoken
i
will
follow
your
counsel
pisthetaerus
is
acting
wisely
by
zeus
cinesias
on
my
light
pinions
i
soar
off
to
olympus
in
its
capricious
flight
my
muse
flutters
along
the
thousand
paths
of
poetry
in
turn
f
there
was
a
real
cinesias
a
dythyrambic
poet
born
at
thebes
pisthetaerus
this
is
a
fellow
will
need
a
whole
shipload
of
wings
cinesias
singing
and
being
fearless
and
vigorous
it
is
seeking
fresh
outlet
pisthetaerus
welcome
cinesias
you
man
why
have
you
come
here
your
game
leg
in
circles
f
the
scholiast
thinks
that
cinesias
who
was
tall
and
slight
of
build
wore
a
kind
of
corset
of
to
support
his
waist
surely
rather
a
interpretation
cinesias
i
want
to
become
a
bird
a
tuneful
nightingale
pisthetaerus
enough
of
that
sort
of
ditty
tell
me
what
you
want
cinesias
give
me
wings
and
i
will
fly
into
the
topmost
airs
to
gather
fresh
songs
in
the
clouds
in
the
midst
of
the
vapours
and
the
fleecy
snow
pisthetaerus
gather
songs
in
the
clouds
cinesias
is
on
them
the
whole
of
our
art
depends
the
most
brilliant
dithyrambs
are
those
that
flap
their
wings
in
void
space
and
are
clothed
in
mist
and
dense
obscurity
to
appreciate
this
just
listen
pisthetaerus
oh
no
no
no
cinesias
by
hermes
but
indeed
you
shall
i
shall
travel
through
thine
ethereal
empire
like
a
winged
bird
who
cleaveth
space
with
his
long
neck
pisthetaerus
stop
easy
all
i
say
f
the
greek
word
used
here
was
the
word
of
command
employed
to
stop
the
rowers
cinesias
as
i
soar
over
the
seas
carried
by
the
breath
of
the
winds
pisthetaerus
by
zeus
but
i
cut
your
breath
short
cinesias
now
rushing
along
the
tracks
of
notus
now
nearing
boreas
across
the
infinite
wastes
of
the
ether
pisthetaerus
beats
him
ah
old
man
that
a
pretty
and
clever
idea
truly
pisthetaerus
what
are
you
not
delighted
to
be
cleaving
the
air
f
cinesias
makes
a
bound
each
time
that
pisthetaerus
strikes
him
cinesias
to
treat
a
dithyrambic
poet
for
whom
the
tribes
dispute
with
each
other
in
this
style
f
the
tribes
of
athens
or
rather
the
rich
citizens
belonging
to
them
were
wont
on
to
give
representations
of
dithyrambic
choruses
as
well
as
of
tragedies
and
comedies
pisthetaerus
will
you
stay
with
us
and
form
a
chorus
of
winged
birds
as
slender
as
leotrophides
for
the
cecropid
tribe
f
another
dithyrambic
poet
a
man
of
extreme
leanness
cinesias
you
are
making
game
of
me
is
clear
but
know
that
i
shall
never
leave
you
in
peace
if
i
do
not
have
wings
wherewith
to
traverse
the
air
an
informer
what
are
these
birds
with
downy
feathers
who
look
so
pitiable
to
me
tell
me
oh
swallow
with
the
long
dappled
wings
f
a
parody
of
a
hemistich
from
the
informer
is
dissatisfied
at
only
seeing
birds
of
sombre
plumage
and
poor
appearance
he
would
have
preferred
to
denounce
the
rich
pisthetaerus
oh
but
is
a
regular
invasion
that
threatens
us
here
comes
another
of
them
humming
along
informer
swallow
with
the
long
dappled
wings
once
more
i
summon
you
pisthetaerus
it
his
cloak
i
believe
he
addressing
it
stands
in
great
need
of
the
swallows
return
f
the
informer
says
the
scholiast
was
clothed
with
a
ragged
cloak
the
tatters
of
which
hung
down
like
wings
in
fact
a
cloak
that
could
not
protect
him
from
the
cold
and
must
have
made
him
long
for
the
swallows
return
the
spring
informer
where
is
he
who
gives
out
wings
to
all
comers
pisthetaerus
is
i
but
you
must
tell
me
for
what
purpose
you
want
them
informer
ask
no
questions
i
want
wings
and
wings
i
must
have
pisthetaerus
do
you
want
to
fly
straight
to
pellene
f
a
town
in
achaia
where
woollen
cloaks
were
made
informer
i
why
i
am
an
accuser
of
the
islands
an
informer
f
his
trade
was
to
accuse
the
rich
citizens
of
the
subject
islands
and
drag
them
before
the
athenian
court
he
explains
later
the
special
advantages
of
this
branch
of
the
informer
business
pisthetaerus
a
fine
trade
truly
informer
a
hatcher
of
lawsuits
hence
i
have
great
need
of
wings
to
prowl
round
the
cities
and
drag
them
before
justice
pisthetaerus
would
you
do
this
better
if
you
had
wings
informer
no
but
i
should
no
longer
fear
the
pirates
i
should
return
with
the
cranes
loaded
with
a
supply
of
lawsuits
by
way
of
ballast
pisthetaerus
so
it
seems
despite
all
your
youthful
vigour
you
make
it
your
trade
to
denounce
strangers
informer
well
and
why
not
i
do
know
how
to
dig
pisthetaerus
but
by
zeus
there
are
honest
ways
of
gaining
a
living
at
your
age
without
all
this
infamous
trickery
informer
my
friend
i
am
asking
you
for
wings
not
for
words
pisthetaerus
is
just
my
words
that
give
you
wings
informer
and
how
can
you
give
a
man
wings
with
your
words
pisthetaerus
is
thus
that
all
first
start
informer
all
pisthetaerus
have
you
not
often
heard
the
father
say
to
young
men
in
the
barbers
shops
it
astonishing
how
diitrephes
advice
has
made
my
son
fly
to
mine
says
another
has
flown
towards
tragic
poetry
on
the
wings
of
his
imagination
informer
so
that
words
give
wings
pisthetaerus
undoubtedly
words
give
wings
to
the
mind
and
make
a
man
soar
to
heaven
thus
i
hope
that
my
wise
words
will
give
you
wings
to
fly
to
some
less
degrading
trade
informer
but
i
do
not
want
to
pisthetaerus
what
do
you
reckon
on
doing
then
informer
i
wo
belie
my
breeding
from
generation
to
generation
we
have
lived
by
informing
quick
therefore
give
me
quickly
some
light
swift
hawk
or
kestrel
wings
so
that
i
may
summon
the
islanders
sustain
the
accusation
here
and
haste
back
there
again
on
flying
pinions
pisthetaerus
i
see
in
this
way
the
stranger
will
be
condemned
even
before
he
appears
informer
that
just
it
pisthetaerus
and
while
he
is
on
his
way
here
by
sea
you
will
be
flying
to
the
islands
to
despoil
him
of
his
property
informer
you
hit
it
precisely
i
must
whirl
hither
and
thither
like
a
perfect
pisthetaerus
i
catch
the
idea
wait
i
faith
i
got
some
fine
corcyraean
wings
how
do
you
like
them
f
that
is
whips
corcyra
being
famous
for
these
articles
informer
oh
woe
is
me
why
is
a
whip
pisthetaerus
no
no
these
are
the
wings
i
tell
you
that
set
the
top
informer
oh
oh
oh
pisthetaerus
take
your
flight
clear
off
you
miserable
cur
or
you
will
soon
see
what
comes
of
quibbling
and
lying
come
let
us
gather
up
our
wings
and
withdraw
chorus
in
my
ethereal
flights
i
have
seen
many
things
new
and
strange
and
wondrous
beyond
belief
there
is
a
tree
called
cleonymus
belonging
to
an
unknown
species
it
has
no
heart
is
good
for
nothing
and
is
as
tall
as
it
is
cowardly
in
springtime
it
shoots
forth
calumnies
instead
of
buds
and
in
autumn
it
strews
the
ground
with
bucklers
in
place
of
leaves
far
away
in
the
regions
of
darkness
where
no
ray
of
light
ever
enters
there
is
a
country
where
men
sit
at
the
table
of
the
heroes
and
dwell
with
them
always
save
always
in
the
evening
should
any
mortal
meet
the
hero
orestes
at
night
he
would
soon
be
stripped
and
covered
with
blows
from
head
to
foot
f
cleonymous
is
a
standing
butt
of
aristophanes
wit
both
as
an
informer
and
a
notorious
poltroon
f
in
allusion
to
the
cave
of
the
bandit
orestes
the
poet
terms
him
a
hero

because
of
his
heroic
name
orestes
prometheus
ah
by
the
gods
if
only
zeus
does
not
espy
me
where
is
pisthetaerus
pisthetaerus

any
god
behind
me
pisthetaerus
no
none
but
who
are
you
pray
prometheus
what

time

time
why
it
past
noon

you
prometheus

it
the
fall
of
day
is
it
no
later
than
that
f
prometheus
wants
night
to
come
and
so
reduce
the
risk
of
being
seen
from
olympus
pisthetaerus
oh
my
word
but
you
grow
tiresome
prometheus
what
is
zeus
doing
is
he
dispersing
the
clouds
or
gathering
them
f
the
clouds
would
prevent
zeus
seeing
what
was
happening
below
him
pisthetaerus
take
care
lest
i
lose
all
patience
prometheus
come
i
will
raise
my
mask

stop
speak
lower
pisthetaerus
why
what
the
matter
prometheus
prometheus
do
call
me
by
my
name
you
will
be
my
ruin
if
zeus
should
see
me
here
but
if
you
want
me
to
tell
you
how
things
are
going
in
heaven
take
this
umbrella
and
shield
me
so
that
the
gods
do
see
me
pisthetaerus
i
can
recognize
prometheus
in
this
cunning
trick
come
quick
then
and
fear
nothing
speak
on
prometheus
then
listen
pisthetaerus
i
am
listening
proceed
prometheus
it
all
over
with
zeus
pisthetaerus
ah
and
since
when
pray
prometheus
since
you
founded
this
city
in
the
air
there
is
not
a
man
who
now
sacrifices
to
the
gods
the
smoke
of
the
victims
no
longer
reaches
us
not
the
smallest
offering
comes
we
fast
as
though
it
were
the
festival
of
demeter
the
barbarian
gods
who
are
dying
of
hunger
are
bawling
like
illyrians
and
threaten
to
make
an
armed
descent
upon
zeus
if
he
does
not
open
markets
where
joints
of
the
victims
are
sold
f
the
third
day
of
the
festival
of
demeter
was
a
fast
f
a
people
addicted
to
violence
and
brigandage
pisthetaerus
what
there
are
other
gods
besides
you
barbarian
gods
who
dwell
above
olympus
prometheus
if
there
were
no
barbarian
gods
who
would
be
the
patron
of
execestides
f
who
being
reputed
a
stranger
despite
his
pretension
to
the
title
of
a
citizen
could
only
have
a
strange
god
for
his
patron
or
tutelary
deity
pisthetaerus
and
what
is
the
name
of
these
gods
prometheus
their
name
why
the
triballi
f
the
triballi
were
a
thracian
people
it
was
a
term
commonly
used
in
athens
to
describe
coarse
men
obscene
debauchees
and
greedy
parasites
pisthetaerus
ah
indeed
is
from
that
no
doubt
that
we
derive
the
word
f
there
is
a
similar
pun
in
the
greek
prometheus
most
likely
but
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
for
certain
namely
that
zeus
and
the
celestial
triballi
are
going
to
send
deputies
here
to
sue
for
peace
now
do
you
treat
unless
zeus
restores
the
sceptre
to
the
birds
and
gives
you
basileia
in
marriage
f
the
of
greece
the
real
object
of
the
war
pisthetaerus
who
is
this
basileia
prometheus
a
very
fine
young
damsel
who
makes
the
lightning
for
zeus
all
things
come
from
her
wisdom
good
laws
virtue
the
fleet
calumnies
the
public
paymaster
and
the
triobolus
pisthetaerus
ah
then
she
is
a
sort
of
general
manageress
to
the
god
prometheus
yes
precisely
if
he
gives
you
her
for
your
wife
yours
will
be
the
almighty
power
that
is
what
i
have
come
to
tell
you
for
you
know
my
constant
and
habitual
goodwill
towards
men
pisthetaerus
oh
yes
is
thanks
to
you
that
we
roast
our
meat
f
prometheus
had
stolen
the
fire
from
the
gods
to
gratify
mankind
prometheus
i
hate
the
gods
as
you
know
pisthetaerus
aye
by
zeus
you
have
always
detested
them
prometheus
towards
them
i
am
a
veritable
timon
but
i
must
return
in
all
haste
so
give
me
the
umbrella
if
zeus
should
see
me
from
up
there
he
would
think
i
was
escorting
one
of
the
canephori
f
a
celebrated
misanthrope
contemporary
to
aristophanes
hating
the
society
of
men
he
had
only
a
single
friend
apimantus
to
whom
he
was
attached
because
of
their
similarity
of
character
he
also
liked
alcibiades
because
he
foresaw
that
this
young
man
would
be
the
ruin
of
his
country
f
the
canephori
were
young
maidens
chosen
from
the
first
families
of
the
city
who
carried
baskets
wreathed
with
myrtle
at
the
feast
of
athene
while
at
those
of
bacchus
and
demeter
they
appeared
with
gilded

daughters
of

aliens

behind
them

one
day
to
see
his
soul
which
he
had
left
there
when
still
alive
he
offered
a
little
victim
a
camel
slit
his
throat

following
the
example
of
ulysses
stepped
one
pace
backwards

bat
of

up
from

sciapodes

dwelt
on

wishes
to
convey
that
they
are
walking
in
the
dark
and
busying
themselves
with
the
greatest
nonsense
f
this
pisander
was
a
notorious
coward
for
this
reason
the
poet
jestingly
supposes
that
he
had
lost
his
soul
the
seat
of
courage
f
considering
the
shape
and
height
of
the
camel
it
can
certainly
not

to
have

is

is

come
as
ambassadors
to
triballus
hi
what
are
you
up
to
you
are
throwing
your
cloak
over
the
left
shoulder
come
fling
it
quick
over
the
right
and
why
pray
does
it
draggle
in
this
fashion
have
you
ulcers
to
hide
like
laespodias
oh
democracy
whither
oh
whither
are
you
leading
us
is
it
possible
that
the
gods
have
chosen
such

envoy

appears
on
the
stage
accompanied
by
heracles
and
a
triballian
god
f
an
athenian
neptune
is
trying
to
give
triballus
some
notions
of
elegance
and
good
behaviour
f
aristophanes
supposes
that
democracy
is
in
the
ascendant
in
olympus
as
it
is
in
athens
triballus
leave
me
alone
posidon
ugh
the
cursed
savage
you
are
by
far
the
most
barbarous
of
all
the
tell
me
heracles
what
are
we
going
to
do
heracles
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
want
to
strangle
the
fellow
who
has
dared
to
block
us
in
posidon
but
my
friend
we
are
envoys
of
peace
heracles
all
the
more
reason
why
i
wish
to
strangle
him

hand
me
the
bring
me
the
silphium
for
sauce
pass
me
the
cheese
and
watch
the
coals
f
he
is
addressing
his
servant
manes

mortal
we
who
greet
you
are
three
gods

wait
a
bit
till
i
have
prepared
my
silphium
pickle
heracles
what
are
these
meats
f
heracles
softens
at
sight
of
the
heracles
is
the
glutton
of
the
comic
poets
pisthetaerus
these
are
birds
that
have
been
punished
with
death
for
attacking
the
people
friends
heracles
and
you
are
seasoning
them
before
answering
us
pisthetaerus
ah
heracles
welcome
welcome
what
the
matter
f
he
pretends
not
to
have
seen
them
at
first
being
so
much
engaged
with
his
cookery
heracles
the
gods
have
sent
us
here
as
ambassadors
to
treat
for
peace
a
servant
there
no
more
oil
in
the
flask
pisthetaerus
and
yet
the
birds
must
be
thoroughly
basted
with
it
f
he
pretends
to
forget
the
presence
of
the
ambassadors
heracles
we
have
no
interest
to
serve
in
fighting
you
as
for
you
be
friends
and
we
promise
that
you
shall
always
have
in
your
pools
and
the
warmest
of
warm
weather
so
far
as
these
points
go
we
are
armed
with
plenary
authority
pisthetaerus
we
have
never
been
the
aggressors
and
even
now
we
are
as
well
disposed
for
peace
as
yourselves
provided
you
agree
to
one
equitable
condition
namely
that
zeus
yield
his
sceptre
to
the
birds
if
only
this
is
agreed
to
i
invite
the
ambassadors
to
dinner
heracles
that
good
enough
for
me
i
vote
for
peace
posidon
you
wretch
you
are
nothing
but
a
fool
and
a
glutton
do
you
want
to
dethrone
your
own
father
pisthetaerus
what
an
error
why
the
gods
will
be
much
more
powerful
if
the
birds
govern
the
earth
at
present
the
mortals
are
hidden
beneath
the
clouds
escape
your
observation
and
commit
perjury
in
your
name
but
if
you
had
the
birds
for
your
allies
and
a
man
after
having
sworn
by
the
crow
and
zeus
should
fail
to
keep
his
oath
the
crow
would
dive
down
upon
him
unawares
and
pluck
out
his
eye
posidon
well
thought
of
by
posidon
f
posidon
jestingly
swears
by
himself
heracles
my
notion
too
pisthetaerus
to
the
triballian
and
you
what
your
opinion
triballus
nabaisatreu
f
the
barbarian
god
utters
some
gibberish
which
pisthetaerus
interprets
into
consent
pisthetaerus
see
he
also
approves
but
hear
another
thing
in
which
we
can
serve
you
if
a
man
vows
to
offer
a
sacrifice
to
some
god
and
then
procrastinates
pretending
that
the
gods
can
wait
and
thus
does
not
keep
his
word
we
shall
punish
his
stinginess
posidon
ah
ah
and
how
pisthetaerus
while
he
is
counting
his
money
or
is
in
the
bath
a
kite
will
relieve
him
before
he
knows
it
either
in
coin
or
in
clothes
of
the
value
of
a
couple
of
sheep
and
carry
it
to
the
god
heracles
i
vote
for
restoring
them
the
sceptre
posidon
ask
the
triballian
heracles
hi
triballian
do
you
want
a
thrashing
triballus
saunaka
baktarikrousa
heracles
he
says
right
willingly
posidon
if
that
be
the
opinion
of
both
of
you
why
i
consent
too
heracles
very
well
we
accord
the
sceptre
pisthetaerus
ah
i
was
nearly
forgetting
another
condition
i
will
leave
here
to
zeus
but
only
if
the
young
basileia
is
given
me
in
marriage
posidon
then
you
do
want
peace
let
us
withdraw
pisthetaerus
it
matters
mighty
little
to
me
cook
look
to
the
gravy
heracles
what
an
odd
fellow
this
posidon
is
where
are
you
off
to
are
we
going
to
war
about
a
woman
posidon
what
else
is
there
to
do
heracles
what
else
why
conclude
peace
posidon
oh
you
ninny
do
you
always
want
to
be
fooled
why
you
are
seeking
your
own
downfall
if
zeus
were
to
die
after
having
yielded
them
the
sovereignty
you
would
be
ruined
for
you
are
the
heir
of
all
the
wealth
he
will
leave
behind
pisthetaerus
oh
by
the
gods
how
he
is
cajoling
you
step
aside
that
i
may
have
a
word
with
you
your
uncle
is
getting
the
better
of
you
my
poor
friend
the
law
will
not
allow
you
an
obolus
of
the
paternal
property
for
you
are
a
bastard
and
not
a
legitimate
child
f
heracles
the
god
of
strength
was
far
from
being
remarkable
in
the
way
of
cleverness
heracles
i
a
bastard
what
that
you
tell
me
pisthetaerus
why
certainly
are
you
not
born
of
a
stranger
woman
besides
is
not
athene
recognized
as
zeus
sole
heiress
and
no
daughter
would
be
that
if
she
had
a
legitimate
brother
heracles
but
what
if
my
father
wished
to
give
me
his
property
on
his
even
though
i
be
a
bastard
pisthetaerus
the
law
forbids
it
and
this
same
posidon
would
be
the
first
to
lay
claim
to
his
wealth
in
virtue
of
being
his
legitimate
brother
listen
thus
runs
solon
law
a
bastard
shall
not
inherit
if
there
are
legitimate
children
and
if
there
are
no
legitimate
children
the
property
shall
pass
to
the
nearest
kin
f
this
was
athenian
law
heracles
and
i
get
nothing
whatever
of
the
paternal
property
pisthetaerus
absolutely
nothing
but
tell
me
has
your
father
had
you
entered
on
the
registers
of
his
phratria
f
the
poet
attributes
to
the
gods
the
same
customs
as
those
which
governed
athens
and
according
to
which
no
child
was
looked
upon
as
legitimate
unless
his
father
had
entered
him
on
the
registers
of
his
phratria
the
phratria
was
a
division
of
the
tribe
and
consisted
of
thirty
families
heracles
no
and
i
have
long
been
surprised
at
the
omission
pisthetaerus
what
ails
you
that
you
should
shake
your
fist
at
heaven
do
you
want
to
fight
it
why
be
on
my
side
i
will
make
you
a
king
and
will
feed
you
on
bird
milk
and
honey
heracles
your
further
condition
seems
fair
to
me
i
cede
you
the
young
damsel
posidon
but
i
i
vote
against
this
opinion
pisthetaerus
then
it
all
depends
on
the
triballian
to
the
triballian
what
do
you
say
triballus
big
bird
give
daughter
pretty
and
queen
heracles
you
say
that
you
give
her
posidon
why
no
he
does
not
say
anything
of
the
sort
that
he
gives
her
else
i
can
not
understand
any
better
than
the
swallows
pisthetaerus
exactly
so
does
he
not
say
she
must
be
given
to
the
swallows
posidon
very
well
you
two
arrange
the
matter
make
peace
since
you
wish
it
so
i
hold
my
tongue
heracles
we
are
of
a
mind
to
grant
you
all
that
you
ask
but
come
up
there
with
us
to
receive
basileia
and
the
celestial
bounty
pisthetaerus
here
are
birds
already
cut
up
and
very
suitable
for
a
nuptial
feast
heracles
you
go
and
if
you
like
i
will
stay
here
to
roast
them
pisthetaerus
you
to
roast
them
you
are
too
much
the
glutton
come
along
with
us
heracles
ah
how
well
i
would
have
treated
myself
pisthetaerus
let
some
one
bring
me
a
beautiful
and
magnificent
tunic
for
the
wedding
chorus
at
phanae
near
the
clepsydra

dwells
a
people

have
neither

reap

among
them
the
philippi

to

englottogastorian
philippi

introduced
the
custom
all
over

of
cutting
out

chorus
continues
to
tell
what
it
has
seen
on
its
flights
f
the
harbour
of
the
island
of
chios

this
name
is
here
used
in
the
sense

being
the
land
of
informers

greek
for

gain
