the
indifference
of

an
audacious
proposition
anthony
robeson
glanced
about
him
in
a
satisfied
way
at
the
shaded
nook
under
the
boughs
into
which
he
had
guided
the
boat
then
he
drew
in
his
oars
and
let
the
little
craft
drift
this
is
an
ideal
spot
said
he
looking
into
his
friend
face
in
which
to
tell
you
a
rather
interesting
piece
of
news
oh
fine
cried
his
friend
settling
herself
among
the
cushions
in
the
stern
and
tilting
back
her
parasol
so
that
the
light
through
its
white
expanse
framed
her
face
in
a
sort
of
glory
tell
me
at
once
i
suspected
you
came
with
something
on
your
mind
there
could
be
a
lovelier
place
on
the
river
than
this
for
confidences
but
i
can
guess
yours
tony
you
found
and
you
be
my
friend
just
the
same
questioned
anthony
anxiously
my
chum
my
confidante
oh
well
tony
that
absurd
declared
juliet
marcy
severely
as
if
would
allow
it
she
three
thousand
miles
away
i
ashamed
of
you
just
in
the
interval
then
pleaded
anthony
i
need
you
now
worse
than
ever
for
i
a
tremendous
responsibility
on
my
hands
the
the
you
know
is
to
come
off
in
september
and
this
is
june
and
i
a
house
to
furnish
will
you
help
me
do
it
juliet
robeson
she
said
explosively
under
her
breath
with
a
laugh
then
she
sat
up
and
leaned
forward
with
a
commanding
gesture
tell
me
all
about
it
what
is
her
name
and
who
is
she
where
did
you
meet
her
are
you
very
much
would
i
marry
a
girl
if
i
were
not
much
demanded
anthony
well
i
tell
you
since
you
insist
on
these
before
you
really
come
down
to
business
her
name
is
eleanor
langham
and
she
lives
in
san
francisco
her
family
is
old
aristocratic
wealthy
yet
she
condescends
to
me
he
looked
up
keenly
into
her
eyes
and
her
brown
lashes
fell
for
an
instant
before
something
in
his
glance
but
she
said
quickly
go
on
when
the
affair
is
over
i
want
to
bring
my
bride
straight
home
anthony
proceeded
with
a
tinge
of
colour
in
his
smooth
clear
cheek
i
shall
have
no
vacation
to
speak
of
at
that
time
of
year
and
no
time
to
spend
in
furnishing
a
house
yet
i
want
it
all
ready
for
her
so
you
see
i
need
a
friend
i
shall
have
two
weeks
to
spare
in
july
and
if
you
would
help
me
but
tony
she
interrupted
how
could
i
if
if
we
were
seen
shopping
together
no
we
could
go
shopping
together
in
new
york
without
being
liable
to
run
into
a
wondering
crowd
of
friends
of
course
not
in
the
places
where
you
would
want
to
go
but
here
you
are
only
a
couple
of
hours
from
boston
you
will
be
here
all
summer
you
and
dingley
and
i
could
run
into
boston
for
a
day
at
a
time
without
anybody
being
the
wiser
i
know
that
is
i
confident
dingley
would
do
it
for
me
oh
of
course
did
auntie
ever
deny
you
anything
since
the
days
when
she
used
to
give
you
jam
as
often
as
you
came
across
to
play
with
me
never
have
you
photograph
inquired
miss
marcy
with
an
emphasis
which
left
no
possible
doubt
as
to
whose
photograph
she
meant
i
expected
that
said
anthony
gravely
i
expected
it
even
sooner
but
i
am
prepared
she
sat
watching
him
curiously
as
he
slowly
drew
from
his
a
tiny
leather
case
and
gazed
at
it
precisely
as
a
lover
might
be
expected
to
gaze
at
his
lady
image
before
jealously
surrendering
it
into
other
hands
she
had
never
seen
anthony
robeson
look
at
any
photograph
except
her
own
with
just
that
expression
she
had
often
wondered
if
he
ever
would
she
had
recommended
this
course
of
procedure
to
him
many
times
usually
after
once
more
gently
refusing
to
marry
him
she
had
begun
at
last
to
doubt
whether
it
would
ever
be
possible
to
divert
tony
mind
from
its
object
but
that
trip
to
san
francisco
and
the
months
he
had
spent
there
in
the
interests
of
the
firm
he
served
had
evidently
brought
about
the
desired
change
she
had
not
seen
him
since
his
return
until
when
he
had
run
up
into
the
country
where
was
the
marcy
summer
home
to
tell
her
as
she
now
understood
his
news
and
to
make
his
somewhat
extraordinary
request
she
accepted
the
photograph
with
a
smile
and
studied
it
with
attention
oh
but
is
she
pretty
she
cried
warmly
and
generously
for
she
was
thinking
as
she
looked
how
much
prettier
was
miss
langham
than
miss
marcy
is
she
agreed
anthony
with
enthusiasm
lovely
what
eyes
and
what
a
dear
mouth
you
right
she
looks
clever
too
she
is
how
tall
is
she
about
up
to
my
shoulder
she
little
then
well
i
do
know
objected
anthony
surveying
his
own
stalwart
length
of
limb
a
girl
does
have
to
be
a
dwarf
not
to
be
on
a
level
with
me
i
should
say
she
must
be
somewhere
near
your
height
what
a
magnificent
dresser
is
she
she
never
irritates
one
with
the
fact
oh
but
i
can
see
and
she
going
to
marry
you
tony
what
can
you
give
her
a
little
box
of
a
house
one
maidservant
an
occasional
trip
into
town
four
new
frocks
a
year
moderate
ones
you
know
in
keeping
with
her
circumstances
and
my
name
replied
anthony
composedly
you
wo
let
her
live
in
town
then
let
her
good
heavens
what
sort
of
a
place
could
i
give
her
in
town
on
my
salary
now
in
the
very
rural
suburb
i
picked
out
she
can
live
in
the
greatest
comfort
and
we
can
have
a
real
home
something
i
have
had
since
dad
died
and
the
old
home
and
the
money
and
all
the
rest
of
it
went
his
face
was
grave
now
and
he
was
staring
down
into
the
water
as
if
he
saw
there
both
what
he
had
lost
and
what
he
hoped
to
gain
yes
said
juliet
sympathetically
though
she
did
not
know
how
to
imagine
the
girl
whose
photograph
she
held
in
the
surroundings
anthony
suggested
presently
she
went
on
in
her
gentlest
tone
i
not
saying
that
the
name
is
a
proud
one
to
offer
her
tony
and
if
she
is
willing
to
share
your
altered
fortunes
i
no
doubt
she
will
be
happy
along
with
your
name
you
give
her
a
heart
worth
having
thank
you
said
anthony
without
looking
up
miss
marcy
coloured
slightly
and
hastened
to
supplement
this
speech
with
another
the
question
is
since
the
home
is
to
be
hers
why
not
let
her
furnish
it
her
tastes
and
mine
might
not
agree
besides
well
why
you
know
tony
explained
juliet
in
some
confusion
i
know
how
to
be
economical
i
aware
that
you
have
been
brought
up
on
the
most
economical
basis
anthony
acknowledged
frankly
but
i
take
care
of
my
funds
no
matter
how
extravagant
you
are
inclined
to
be
if
i
should
hand
you
five
dollars
and
say
a
you
could
do
it
could
you
you
satisfy
your
ideals
of
course
but
you
could
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
discriminating
choice
within
the
limit
juliet
laughed
but
in
her
eyes
there
grew
nevertheless
a
look
of
doubt
tony
she
demanded
how
much
have
you
to
spend
on
the
furnishing
of
that
house
just
five
hundred
dollars
said
anthony
concisely
and
that
must
cover
the
repairing
and
painting
of
the
outside
really
juliet
have
i
done
fairly
well
to
save
up
that
and
the
cost
of
the
house
and
lot
for
a
fellow
who
till
five
years
ago
never
did
a
thing
for
himself
and
never
expected
to
need
to
yes
i
know
the
piano
in
your
cost
twice
that
and
so
did
the
horses
you
drive
and
a
very
few
of
your
pretty
gowns
would
swallow
another
five
but
anthony
robeson
will
have
to
chasten
her
ideas
a
trifle
do
you
know
juliet
i
think
she
will
for
love
of
me
he
was
smiling
at
his
own
audacious
confidence
juliet
attempted
no
reply
to
this
very
unanswerable
statement
she
studied
the
photograph
in
silence
and
he
lay
watching
her
in
her
boating
suit
she
was
a
pleasant
object
to
look
at
will
you
help
me
he
asked
again
at
length
i
more
anxious
than
i
can
tell
you
to
have
everything
ready
i
should
like
to
fail
you
tony
since
you
really
wish
it
though
very
sure
you
find
me
a
poor
adviser
but
you
have
been
a
brother
to
me
since
the
days
for
nothing
and
if
i
can
help
you
with
suggestions
as
to
colour
and
style
i
be
glad
to
though
i
shall
all
the
while
be
trying
to
live
up
to
this
photograph
and
that
will
be
a
little
hard
on
the
scale
you
only
to
look
out
that
everything
is
in
good
taste
said
anthony
quietly
and
that
you
ca
help
doing
my
wife
will
thank
you
and
the
new
home
will
be
sweet
to
her
because
of
you
it
surely
will
to
me
measurements
it
was
on
the
first
day
of
robeson
july
vacation
that
he
came
to
take
juliet
marcy
and
her
aunt
dingley
who
had
long
stood
to
her
in
the
place
of
the
mother
she
had
early
lost
to
see
the
home
he
had
bought
in
a
remote
suburb
of
a
great
city
it
was
a
journey
from
the
marcy
country
place
but
he
had
insisted
that
juliet
could
not
furnish
the
house
intelligently
until
she
had
studied
it
in
detail
so
at
eleven
of
a
hot
july
morning
miss
marcy
found
herself
surveying
from
the
roadway
a
small
white
house
with
green
blinds
shading
its
odd
windows
a
very
box
of
a
house
as
anthony
had
said
set
well
back
from
the
quiet
street
and
surrounded
by
untrimmed
trees
and
overgrown
shrubbery
the
whole
place
had
a
neglected
appearance
even
the
luxuriant
which
did
its
best
to
hide
the
worn
white
paint
of
the
served
to
intensify
the
look
of
decay
charming
is
it
asked
robeson
with
the
air
of
the
delighted
proprietor
of
course
everything
looks
gone
to
seed
but
paint
and
a
and
a
few
other
things
will
make
another
place
of
it
it
good
old
colonial
that
sure
and
only
needs
a
bit
of
fixing
up
to
be
quite
correct
architecturally
small
as
it
is
he
led
the
way
up
the
weedy
path
dingley
and
juliet
exchanging
amused
glances
behind
his
back
he
opened
the
doors
with
a
flourish
and
waved
the
ladies
in
they
entered
with
skirts
and
noses
involuntarily
sniffing
at
the
musty
air
anthony
ran
around
opening
windows
and
explaining
the
points
of
the
house
when
they
had
been
over
it
dingley
warm
and
weary
subsided
upon
the
while
juliet
and
anthony
fell
to
discussing
the
possibilities
of
the
place
you
see
said
anthony
mopping
his
heated
brow
it
is
like
having
big
high
rooms
to
decorate
these
little
rooms
he
put
up
his
hand
and
succeeded
from
his
fine
height
in
touching
the
ceiling
of
the
lower
front
room
in
which
they
stood
wo
stand
anything
but
the
most
simple
treatment
and
expensive
papers
and
upholsteries
would
be
out
of
place
it
will
take
only
very
small
rugs
to
suit
the
floors
the
main
thing
for
you
to
think
of
will
be
colours
and
effects
you
find
five
hundred
dollars
will
go
a
long
way
even
after
the
repairs
and
outside
painting
are
disposed
of
he
looked
so
appealing
that
juliet
could
but
answer
heartily
yes
sure
of
it
and
now
tony
do
you
think
you
better
draw
a
plan
of
the
house
putting
in
all
the
measurements
so
we
shall
know
just
how
to
go
to
work
and
i
will
go
around
and
dream
a
while
in
each
room
give
me
the
photograph
you
devoted
lover
so
i
can
plan
things
to
suit
anthony
laughed
and
put
his
hand
into
his
but
he
drew
it
out
empty
why
i
left
it
behind
he
admitted
in
some
embarrassment
i
really
thought
i
had
it
oh
tony
and
on
this
very
trip
when
we
needed
it
most
how
could
you
leave
it
behind
do
you
always
carry
it
next
your
heart
is
that
the
prescribed
place
certainly
i
should
doubt
a
man
love
if
he
did
not
constantly
wear
my
likeness
right
where
it
could
feel
his
heart
beating
for
me
now
i
never
supposed
remarked
anthony
considering
her
attentively
that
you
had
so
much
romance
about
you
do
you
realise
that
for
an
extremely
practical
young
person
such
as
you
have
mostly
appeared
to
be
that
is
a
particularly
sentimental
suggestion
er
should
you
wear
his
in
the
same
way
may
i
inquire
of
course
returned
juliet
with
defiance
in
her
eyes
whose
lashes
when
they
fell
at
length
before
his
steadily
interested
gaze
swept
a
daintily
colouring
cheek
have
you
ever
worn
one
inquired
this
hardy
young
man
nothing
daunted
by
these
signs
of
righteous
indignation
but
all
he
got
for
answer
was
a
vigorous
you
absurd
boy
now
go
to
work
at
your
measurements
i
going
upstairs
there
one
room
up
there
the
one
with
the
gable
corners
and
the
little
bits
of
windows
that
perfectly
fascinating
it
must
be
done
in
delft
blue
and
white
since
i
have
the
photograph
she
turned
on
the
threshold
to
smile
roguishly
back
at
him
memory
must
serve
beautiful
dark
hair
eyes
like
a
madonna
a
perfect
nose
the
dearest
mouth
in
the
world
oh
yes
she
vanished
around
the
corner
only
to
put
her
head
in
again
with
the
air
of
one
who
fires
a
parting
shot
at
a
discomfited
enemy
but
tony
do
you
honestly
think
the
house
is
large
enough
for
such
a
queen
of
a
woman
wo
her
throne
take
up
the
whole
of
the
first
floor
then
she
was
gone
up
the
diminutive
staircase
and
her
light
footsteps
could
be
heard
on
the
bare
floors
overhead
left
alone
anthony
robeson
stood
still
for
a
moment
looking
fixedly
at
the
door
by
which
she
had
gone
the
smile
with
which
he
had
answered
her
gay
fling
had
faded
his
eyes
had
grown
dark
with
a
singular
fire
his
hands
were
clenched
suddenly
he
strode
across
the
floor
and
stopped
by
the
door
he
was
looking
down
at
the
quaint
old
latch
which
served
instead
of
a
knob
then
with
a
glance
at
the
unconscious
back
of
dingley
sitting
sleepily
on
the
little
porch
outside
he
stooped
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
the
iron
where
juliet
hand
had
lain
shopping
with
a
chaperon
five
hundred
dollars
mused
miss
marcy
on
the
boston
train
next
morning
six
rooms
kitchen
and
three
bedrooms
that
you
forget
warned
anthony
robeson
from
the
seat
where
he
faced
juliet
and
dingley
that
must
cover
the
outside
painting
and
repairs
you
ca
figure
on
having
more
than
three
hundred
dollars
left
for
the
inside
dear
me
yes
frowned
juliet
she
held
anthony
plan
in
her
hand
and
her
tablets
and
pencil
lay
in
her
lap
well
i
can
spend
fifty
dollars
on
each
room
only
some
will
need
more
than
others
the
will
take
the
most
no
the
the
kitchen
will
take
the
most
suggested
dingley
your
range
will
use
up
the
most
of
your
fifty
and
kitchen
utensils
count
up
very
rapidly
it
will
be
a
very
small
range
anthony
said
a
little
toy
stove
would
be
more
practical
for
our
the
kitchen
how
big
is
it
juliet
by
fourteen
read
juliet
from
the
centre
of
the
room
you
can
hit
all
the
side
walls
with
the
broom
speaking
of
walls
tony
those
must
be
our
first
consideration
if
we
get
our
colour
scheme
right
everything
else
will
follow
i
have
it
all
in
my
head
so
it
proved
but
it
also
proved
when
they
had
been
hard
at
work
for
an
hour
at
a
decorator
that
the
tints
and
designs
for
which
miss
marcy
asked
were
not
readily
to
be
found
in
the
to
which
anthony
rigidly
held
her
i
must
have
the
softest
most
restful
greens
for
the
she
announced
there
but
that
is
a
dollar
a
roll
whispered
anthony
then
cents
but
for
that
little
room
tony
cents
a
roll
is
all
we
can
allow
insisted
anthony
firmly
and
less
than
that
everywhere
else
the
salesman
was
very
obliging
and
showed
the
best
things
possible
for
the
money
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
appeal
in
the
eyes
of
this
critical
but
restricted
young
buyer
there
that
will
do
i
think
said
juliet
at
length
with
a
long
breath
the
green
for
the
and
for
the
bit
of
a
hall
no
no
tony
i
just
thought
you
must
take
away
that
little
partition
and
let
the
stairs
go
up
out
of
the
that
will
improve
the
apparent
size
of
things
wonderfully
all
right
agreed
anthony
obediently
then
we
put
that
rich
red
in
the
for
upstairs
there
is
the
tiny
rose
pattern
and
the
delft
blue
and
that
little
pale
yellow
and
white
stripe
in
the
kitchen
we
have
the
tile
pattern
we
wo
have
a
border
anywhere
the
rooms
are
too
low
just
those
simplest
mouldings
and
the
ivory
white
on
the
ceilings
the
woodwork
must
all
be
white
there
now
that
settled
next
come
the
floors
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
juliet
was
becoming
interested
in
her
task
though
the
july
heat
was
intense
she
led
the
way
with
rapid
steps
to
the
place
where
she
meant
to
select
her
rugs
here
the
three
spent
a
trying
two
hours
it
was
hard
to
please
miss
marcy
with
japanese
jute
rugs
satisfactory
in
colouring
though
many
of
them
were
when
she
longed
to
buy
persian
pieces
of
distinction
if
juliet
had
a
special
weakness
it
was
for
choice
antique
rugs
she
cornered
anthony
at
last
while
dingley
and
the
salesman
were
politely
but
unequivocally
disputing
over
the
quality
of
a
certain
piece
of
chinese
weaving
tony
she
begged
please
let
me
get
that
one
dear
turkish
square
for
the
it
will
give
character
to
the
whole
room
and
the
colours
are
perfectly
exquisite
i
simply
ca
get
one
of
those
cheap
things
to
go
in
front
of
that
beautiful
old
fireplace
imagine
the
firelight
on
that
square
it
would
make
you
want
to
spend
your
evenings
at
home
please
do
you
imagine
that
i
shall
ever
want
to
spend
them
anywhere
else
asked
tony
softly
looking
down
into
her
appealing
face
why
chum
i
like
to
get
that
tabriz
you
admire
so
much
if
it
would
please
you
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
should
have
to
pull
the
whole
house
up
forty
notches
to
match
it
but
even
the
turkish
square
is
out
of
the
question
but
tony
juliet
was
whispering
now
with
her
head
a
little
bent
and
her
eyes
on
the
lapel
of
his
coat
wo
you
let
me
do
it
as
my
my
contribution
i
like
to
put
something
of
my
own
into
your
house
you
dear
little
girl
anthony
answered
and
possibly
for
her
own
peace
of
mind
it
was
fortunate
that
miss
langham
of
california
could
not
see
the
look
with
which
he
regarded
miss
marcy
of
massachusetts
i
sure
you
would
and
you
are
putting
into
it
just
what
is
priceless
to
me
your
individuality
and
your
perfect
taste
but
i
ca
let
even
you
help
furnish
that
house
she
must
take
what
i
and
only
i
can
give
her
you
perfectly
ridiculous
murmured
juliet
turning
away
with
an
expression
of
deep
displeasure
as
if
she
would
bring
all
sorts
of
elegant
stuff
with
her
and
make
your
cheap
things
look
insignificant
i
do
think
she
will
returned
anthony
with
conviction
she
bring
nothing
out
of
keeping
with
the
house
i
thought
you
told
me
she
was
of
a
wealthy
family
she
is
but
if
she
marries
me
she
leaves
all
that
behind
i
have
no
wife
on
any
other
basis
well
for
a
son
of
the
robesons
of
kentucky
you
are
absolutely
the
most
absurd
boy
anybody
ever
heard
of
declared
the
girl
hotly
under
her
breath
then
she
walked
over
and
ordered
a
certain
inexpensive
rug
for
the
with
the
air
of
a
princess
and
the
cheeks
of
a
poppy
the
cost
of
frocks
it
may
have
been
that
miss
marcy
was
piqued
into
trying
to
see
how
little
she
could
spend
but
certain
it
was
that
from
the
time
she
left
the
carpet
shop
she
begged
for
no
exceptions
to
robeson
rule
of
strict
economy
she
selected
simple
delicate
muslins
for
the
windows
one
and
all
without
a
glance
at
finer
draperies
bought
denims
and
printed
stuffs
as
if
she
had
never
heard
of
costlier
upholsteries
and
turned
away
from
seductive
pieces
of
turkish
and
indian
embroideries
offered
for
her
inspection
with
a
demure
no
i
do
care
to
look
at
those
now
which
more
than
once
brought
a
covert
smile
to
anthony
lips
and
a
twinkle
to
the
eyes
of
the
salesman
it
was
so
very
evident
that
the
fair
buyer
did
not
pass
them
by
for
lack
of
interest
altogether
it
was
an
interesting
week
these
three
people
spent
for
a
week
it
took
anthony
began
to
protest
after
the
first
two
days
and
said
he
could
not
ask
so
much
of
his
friends
but
juliet
would
not
be
hindered
from
taking
infinite
pains
and
dingley
good
humouredly
lent
the
two
her
chaperonage
and
her
occasional
counsel
such
as
only
the
matron
of
long
housewifely
experience
can
furnish
the
selection
of
the
furniture
took
perhaps
the
most
time
and
was
the
hardest
because
of
the
difficulty
of
finding
good
styles
in
keeping
with
the
limited
purse
anthony
possessed
a
number
of
good
pieces
of
antique
character
but
beyond
these
everything
was
to
be
purchased
juliet
turned
in
despair
from
one
shop
after
another
and
when
it
came
to
the
fitting
of
the
she
grew
distinctly
indignant
it
a
perfect
shame
she
said
that
they
ca
offer
really
good
designs
in
the
cheap
things
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
hideous
tony
if
i
were
you
i
rather
eat
my
breakfast
off
one
of
those
white
kitchen
tables
or
she
broke
off
suddenly
rushed
away
down
the
long
room
to
a
group
of
chastely
elegant
furniture
and
came
back
after
a
little
with
a
face
of
great
eagerness
to
drag
her
companions
away
with
her
she
took
them
to
survey
a
set
of
the
costliest
of
all
have
you
gone
crazy
anthony
inquired
not
at
all
tony
just
study
that
table
it
massive
but
simple
simple
as
beauty
always
is
look
at
those
perfectly
straight
legs
what
clever
cabinet
maker
could
copy
that
in
in
ash
tony
then
there
are
stains
i
heard
of
them
that
rub
into
wood
and
then
finish
in
some
way
so
it
smooth
and
satiny
you
could
do
that
i
sure
you
could
then
you
get
the
lovely
big
top
you
want
and
the
chairs
do
you
see
the
plain
things
i
know
they
could
be
made
this
way
then
the
would
be
simply
dear
juliet
you
coming
on
declared
anthony
with
satisfaction
that
evening
as
the
two
back
at
the
marcy
country
place
strolled
slowly
over
the
lawn
toward
the
river
edge
at
this
rate
you
do
for
a
poor
wife
yourself
some
day
that
frock
you
have
on
now
is
that
a
sort
of
concession
to
the
humble
company
you
in
in
what
way
juliet
glanced
down
at
the
gown
whose
delicate
skirts
she
was
daintily
lifting
and
in
which
she
looked
like
a
flower
in
its
calyx
she
had
rejoiced
to
exchange
the
dusty
dress
in
which
she
had
come
home
from
town
for
this
which
suggested
coolness
in
each
fresh
fold
why
it
strikes
me
as
about
the
simplest
dress
i
ever
saw
you
wear
it
really
well
the
least
expensive
thing
you
have
had
in
that
line
in
some
time
the
amused
laugh
with
which
this
observation
was
greeted
might
have
been
disconcerting
to
anybody
but
anthony
robeson
but
he
maintained
his
ground
with
calmness
how
many
of
these
do
you
think
you
can
furnish
anthony
with
in
a
year
juliet
inquired
her
lips
forcing
themselves
to
soberness
but
the
laughter
lingering
in
her
eyes
several
as
girlishly
demure
as
that
i
fancy
asserted
the
young
man
with
confidence
but
juliet
momentary
gravity
broke
down
oh
you
clever
boy
she
said
i
shall
advise
anthony
to
send
you
shopping
for
her
when
she
needs
a
new
frock
you
will
order
home
just
what
she
wants
without
stopping
to
ask
the
price
you
will
be
so
confident
that
you
know
a
cheap
thing
when
you
see
it
afterward
you
will
pay
the
bill
and
then
the
awful
frown
on
your
brow
you
will
have
to
live
on
bread
and
milk
for
a
month
to
get
your
accounts
straightened
out
oh
tony
no
i
should
do
for
a
poor
wife
not
judging
by
this
demure
gown
you
poor
but
tony
with
a
swift
change
of
manner
i
do
think
the
little
house
will
be
very
charming
indeed
i
can
hardly
wait
to
know
that
the
painting
and
papering
are
done
so
that
we
can
go
down
and
get
things
in
order
i
long
to
arrange
those
fascinating
new
tin
things
in
that
bit
of
a
cupboard
tony
turning
to
him
solemnly
does
know
how
to
cook
i
think
she
is
learning
now
he
assured
her
seems
to
me
she
mentioned
it
in
he
fumbled
in
his
and
brought
out
a
letter
juliet
stole
an
interested
glance
at
it
she
observed
that
there
were
three
closely
written
sheets
of
the
heavy
linen
paper
and
that
the
handwriting
was
one
suggestive
of
a
pleasing
individuality
anthony
in
the
dim
twilight
was
scanning
page
after
page
in
a
lover
absorbed
way
juliet
walked
along
by
his
side
in
silence
she
was
thinking
of
the
face
in
the
photograph
and
wondering
if
miss
eleanor
langham
really
loved
anthony
robeson
as
he
deserved
to
be
loved
for
he
is
a
dear
dear
fellow
she
said
to
herself
and
if
she
could
just
see
him
planning
so
enthusiastically
for
her
comfort
even
if
he
does
have
to
economise
she
no
it
not
in
this
letter
observed
anthony
putting
the
sheets
together
with
a
lingering
touch
which
did
not
escape
his
companion
quick
eyes
it
must
have
been
in
yesterday
does
she
write
every
day
did
you
ever
hear
of
an
engaged
pair
who
did
write
every
day
it
must
take
a
good
deal
of
your
time
she
remarked
but
of
course
she
can
cook
every
sane
girl
takes
a
course
nowadays
as
essential
as
french
you
did
then
of
course
do
you
remember
when
i
used
to
edify
you
with
new
and
wonderful
dishes
every
time
you
dropped
in
to
luncheon
but
did
you
learn
the
more
important
things
i
paid
especial
attention
to
soups
sir
laughed
juliet
now
if
anthony
has
done
that
you
can
live
very
economically
i
suggest
it
to
her
said
anthony
gravely
muslins
and
tackhammers
it
took
several
trips
to
the
small
house
and
a
great
deal
of
hemming
and
ruffling
of
muslin
on
the
part
of
juliet
and
the
marcy
to
say
nothing
of
many
days
of
anthony
hard
labour
to
get
everything
in
place
but
it
was
all
done
at
length
and
the
hour
arrived
to
close
the
new
home
and
leave
it
to
wait
the
oncoming
day
in
september
when
it
should
be
permanently
opened
i
just
go
over
it
once
more
said
juliet
to
dingley
the
latter
lady
was
lying
in
a
hammock
out
under
the
apple
trees
waiting
for
train
time
and
her
final
release
from
duties
which
were
becoming
decidedly
wearisome
it
was
the
first
day
of
august
and
the
evening
was
a
warm
one
anthony
had
gone
off
upon
a
last
errand
of
some
sort
dingley
was
too
exhausted
to
offer
to
accompany
her
niece
and
juliet
ran
back
into
the
house
alone
she
wandered
slowly
through
the
rooms
looking
about
to
see
if
there
might
be
any
perfecting
touch
which
she
could
add
it
was
a
charming
place
even
a
daughter
of
the
house
of
marcy
could
but
own
to
that
under
her
skilful
management
the
little
rooms
had
blossomed
into
a
fresh
satisfying
beauty
that
needed
only
the
addition
of
the
personal
adornment
which
anthony
bride
would
be
sure
to
bring
to
become
a
home
the
home
not
only
of
a
poor
man
but
of
a
refined
and
cultured
one
as
well
restricted
though
she
had
been
to
the
most
inexpensive
means
of
bringing
about
this
happy
result
juliet
had
made
them
all
tell
toward
an
effect
of
great
harmony
and
beauty
perhaps
to
nobody
was
this
more
of
a
revelation
than
to
the
girl
herself
she
was
very
proud
of
the
as
she
looked
about
it
the
partition
between
it
and
the
tiny
hall
had
been
removed
according
to
her
suggestion
and
the
straight
staircase
altered
by
means
of
a
landing
and
an
abrupt
turn
which
transformed
it
into
picturesqueness
with
its
low
broad
steps
its
slender
spindles
and
odd
posts
it
added
much
to
the
character
of
the
room
like
most
old
new
england
houses
this
one
chief
glory
was
its
great
central
chimney
with
big
fireplaces
opening
both
into
the
and
the
in
the
former
between
the
fireplace
and
the
staircase
and
forming
a
suggestion
of
an
inglenook
juliet
had
contrived
a
high
wide
seat
cushioned
in
dull
green
and
boasting
a
number
of
pretty
pillows
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
had
surreptitiously
added
a
little
to
these
in
the
matter
of
certain
modestly
rich
bits
of
material
and
she
contemplated
the
result
with
great
satisfaction
it
may
be
remarked
with
no
comment
whatever
that
in
spite
of
their
beauty
there
was
not
a
pillow
of
all
those
scattered
about
the
house
which
a
weary
man
might
not
tuck
under
his
head
without
fear
of
ruining
a
creation
too
delicate
for
any
use
but
to
be
admired
having
seized
upon
the
idea
of
staining
cheap
material
she
had
carried
it
out
in
a
set
of
low
bookcases
across
the
end
and
one
side
of
the
room
these
awaited
the
coming
of
the
several
hundreds
of
choice
books
which
anthony
had
saved
from
his
father
library
two
fine
old
portraits
dear
to
the
hearts
of
many
generations
of
the
robesons
of
kentucky
lent
distinction
to
the
home
of
their
young
descendant
altogether
the
room
was
both
quaint
and
artistic
and
with
its
few
plain
chairs
and
tables
mostly
heirlooms
and
all
of
good
old
colonial
design
was
a
room
in
which
one
could
readily
imagine
one
self
sitting
down
to
a
winter
evening
of
cosy
comfort
such
as
is
not
always
to
be
had
in
far
finer
the
was
a
study
in
its
reds
and
browns
and
its
furniture
was
an
astonishing
success
if
one
were
not
too
severely
critical
as
she
surveyed
it
juliet
seemed
to
see
the
future
master
and
mistress
of
this
little
home
sitting
down
opposite
each
other
in
the
fireglow
and
smiling
across
the
coming
robeson
if
one
might
judge
by
her
photograph
was
a
woman
to
lend
grace
and
dignity
to
her
surroundings
whatever
they
might
be
juliet
could
imagine
her
pretty
stately
way
of
presiding
at
such
small
feasts
as
the
room
was
destined
to
see
making
her
guests
quite
forget
that
she
was
not
mistress
of
a
mansion
equal
to
any
in
the
land
would
she
be
happy
could
she
be
happy
here
after
all
that
she
had
had
of
another
and
very
different
sort
of
life
for
some
reason
as
juliet
stood
and
looked
and
thought
her
face
grew
very
sober
and
a
breath
escaped
her
lips
the
little
kitchen
was
an
exceedingly
alluring
place
gay
in
the
bravery
of
fresh
paint
and
spotless
shining
utensils
there
were
even
crisp
curtains
at
eight
cents
a
yard
tied
back
at
the
high
triple
window
with
its
diminutive
panes
it
needed
only
a
pot
or
two
of
growing
plants
in
the
window
and
a
phyllis
in
a
figured
gown
to
be
the
kitchen
of
one
dreams
but
it
was
upon
the
rooms
on
the
upper
floor
that
juliet
had
exhausted
her
imagination
and
effort
nothing
could
have
been
conceived
of
more
dainty
than
they
here
her
denims
and
muslins
had
run
riot
low
clad
in
ruffled
hangings
their
padded
tops
delicate
with
the
breath
of
orris
beds
valanced
with
similar
stuffs
chairs
their
seats
cushioned
into
comfort
everything
was
done
in
the
cleverest
imitation
of
the
ancient
styles
in
keeping
with
the
house
it
all
made
one
think
of
the
patter
of
buckled
slippers
and
stiff
rustling
brocaded
gowns
and
powdered
hair
and
the
odours
of
long
ago
anthony
would
never
know
what
his
friendly
had
put
into
these
rooms
of
sentiment
and
charm
a
question
of
identity
at
the
door
of
the
room
the
one
upon
which
the
girl
had
lavished
her
most
tender
fancies
she
stood
at
length
looking
in
and
as
she
looked
something
swam
before
her
eyes
a
sob
rose
in
her
throat
she
choked
it
back
she
brushed
her
hand
across
her
face
then
she
tried
to
laugh
oh
what
a
goose
i
am
she
said
sternly
to
herself
and
then
she
ran
across
the
room
sank
upon
her
knees
before
the
with
its
blue
and
white
cushions
and
burying
her
face
in
one
of
them
cried
her
wretched
jealous
longing
heart
out
anthony
coming
in
hastily
but
softly
through
the
small
kitchen
heard
the
rush
of
footsteps
overhead
and
stopped
he
waited
a
moment
listening
eagerly
then
he
came
noiselessly
into
the
and
stood
still
his
face
always
strong
and
somewhat
stern
in
its
repose
had
in
it
a
certain
unusual
intensity
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
that
there
was
an
hour
before
train
time
then
he
sat
down
where
he
could
see
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
waited
by
and
by
light
footsteps
crossed
the
floor
above
and
came
through
the
little
hall
from
where
he
sat
anthony
caught
the
gleam
of
juliet
crisp
linen
skirt
presently
she
came
slowly
down
as
she
turned
upon
the
landing
she
met
anthony
eyes
looking
up
in
a
fashion
quite
unusual
to
the
straightforward
gaze
of
his
friend
her
eyes
fell
he
saw
that
her
cheeks
were
pale
he
rose
to
meet
her
come
and
rest
he
said
you
are
tired
you
have
worked
too
hard
such
a
helper
a
man
never
had
before
and
you
have
made
a
wonderful
success
juliet
i
ca
thank
you
it
beyond
that
but
she
would
not
be
led
to
the
cosy
corner
by
the
window
she
found
something
needing
her
attention
in
the
curtain
of
the
bookcase
in
the
dimmest
corner
of
the
room
and
began
solicitously
to
pull
it
in
various
ways
as
if
there
were
something
wrong
with
it
he
watched
her
standing
with
his
arm
on
the
high
i
think
you
enjoyed
it
just
a
little
bit
yourself
though
he
observed
did
you
chum
yes
indeed
said
juliet
her
back
was
toward
him
her
head
bent
down
but
his
quick
ear
detected
a
peculiar
quality
in
her
voice
he
questioned
her
again
hurriedly
you
not
sorry
you
did
it
oh
no
said
juliet
now
there
is
not
much
in
two
such
simple
replies
as
these
to
indicate
the
state
of
one
mind
and
heart
but
when
a
girl
has
been
crying
stormily
and
uninterruptedly
for
a
and
is
only
not
crying
still
because
she
is
holding
back
the
torrent
of
her
unhappiness
by
sheer
force
of
will
it
is
radically
impossible
to
say
so
much
as
four
words
in
a
perfectly
natural
way
anthony
understood
in
a
breath
that
the
unfamiliar
note
in
his
friend
voice
was
that
of
tears
and
strange
to
say
into
his
face
there
flashed
a
look
of
triumph
but
he
only
said
very
gently
come
here
a
minute
will
you
juliet
she
bent
lower
over
the
curtain
then
she
stood
up
without
looking
at
him
and
moved
toward
the
door
i
believe
i
rather
tired
she
said
in
a
low
tone
it
has
been
so
warm
all
day
and
i
i
have
a
headache
in
three
steps
he
came
after
her
stopping
her
with
his
hand
grasping
hers
as
she
would
have
left
the
room
come
back
please
he
urged
your
aunt
is
asleep
out
there
i
think
i
wanted
to
go
over
the
house
once
more
with
you
if
you
would
but
too
tired
for
that
just
come
back
and
sit
down
in
this
nook
of
yours
and
let
talk
a
little
she
could
not
well
refuse
and
he
put
her
into
a
nest
of
cushions
arranging
them
carefully
behind
her
back
and
head
and
sat
down
facing
her
he
had
placed
her
just
where
the
waning
light
from
the
western
sky
fell
full
on
her
face
his
own
was
in
the
shadow
he
was
watching
her
unmercifully
she
felt
that
and
desperately
turned
her
face
aside
burying
in
a
friendly
pillow
the
cheek
which
was
colouring
under
his
gaze
is
the
headache
so
bad
he
asked
softly
i
never
knew
juliet
marcy
to
have
a
headache
before
poor
little
girl
dear
little
girl
who
has
worked
so
hard
to
please
her
old
friend
he
leaned
forward
and
she
felt
his
hand
upon
her
hair
the
tenderness
in
his
voice
and
touch
were
carrying
away
all
her
defences
but
he
went
on
without
giving
her
respite
do
you
think
will
be
happy
here
chum
will
it
take
the
place
of
the
old
life
for
a
few
years
till
i
can
give
her
more
she
have
nothing
here
you
know
outside
of
this
little
home
but
my
love
that
would
be
enough
for
any
ordinary
woman
would
it
she
was
not
looking
at
him
but
she
could
see
him
as
plainly
as
if
she
were
always
she
had
thought
him
the
strongest
best
fellow
she
knew
he
had
been
her
devoted
friend
so
long
she
had
not
realised
in
the
least
until
lately
how
it
was
going
to
seem
to
get
on
without
him
but
she
knew
now
she
felt
a
dreadful
choking
in
her
throat
again
it
seemed
to
be
closely
connected
with
another
peculiar
sensation
as
if
her
heart
had
turned
into
a
lump
of
lead
in
another
minute
she
knew
that
she
should
break
down
which
would
be
humiliating
beyond
words
she
started
up
from
her
cushions
with
a
fierce
attempt
to
keep
a
grip
upon
herself
i
know
you
very
happy
she
breathed
and
i
very
glad
but
really
i
i
not
at
all
sentimental
i
afraid
a
headache
does
not
make
one
sympathetic
but
she
could
not
get
past
him
anthony
stalwart
figure
barred
the
way
his
strong
hands
put
her
gently
back
among
the
cushions
she
turned
her
head
away
fighting
hard
for
that
thing
she
could
not
keep
her
is
it
really
a
headache
asked
the
low
voice
in
her
ear
just
a
headache
not
by
any
chance
a
heartache
juliet
anthony
robeson
she
cried
but
guardedly
lest
the
open
window
betray
her
what
do
you
mean
you
say
very
strange
things
why
should
i
have
a
heartache
because
you
are
marrying
the
girl
you
love
how
often
have
i
begged
you
to
go
and
find
her
do
you
think
i
would
have
done
all
this
for
her
and
you
if
i
had
cared
she
tried
to
look
defiantly
into
his
eyes
those
fine
eyes
of
his
which
were
watching
her
so
intently
tried
to
meet
them
steadily
with
her
own
lovely
ones
and
failed
swiftly
an
intense
colour
dyed
her
cheeks
and
she
dropped
her
head
like
a
guilty
child
of
course
i
care
that
is
in
a
way
she
was
somehow
forced
to
admit
before
the
bar
of
his
silence
why
should
i
hate
to
lose
the
friend
who
used
to
carry
my
books
to
school
and
fought
the
other
boys
for
my
sake
and
has
been
a
brother
to
me
all
these
years
of
course
i
do
and
when
i
am
tired
i
cry
for
nothing
just
nothing
i
it
was
certainly
a
brave
attempt
at
eloquence
but
perhaps
it
was
not
wonderfully
convincing
at
all
events
it
did
not
keep
anthony
from
taking
possession
of
one
of
her
hands
and
interrupting
her
with
a
most
irrelevant
speech
juliet
do
you
remember
telling
me
that
you
should
expect
a
man
who
loved
you
to
carry
your
likeness
always
with
him
and
you
asked
me
for
and
i
had
to
own
i
had
left
it
behind
yet
i
had
one
with
me
then
it
is
always
with
me
and
that
was
why
i
forgot
the
other
look
he
drew
out
a
little
silver
case
and
juliet
reluctantly
releasing
one
eye
from
the
shelter
of
the
friendly
sofa
pillow
saw
with
a
start
her
own
face
look
smiling
back
at
her
it
was
a
little
picture
of
her
girlish
self
which
she
had
given
him
long
ago
when
he
went
away
to
college
no
he
said
quickly
as
he
recognised
the
indignant
question
which
instantly
showed
in
her
eyes
i
not
disloyal
to
eleanor
langham
because
dear
there
is
no
such
person
with
a
little
cry
she
flung
herself
away
from
him
among
the
pillows
hiding
her
face
from
sight
there
was
a
moment
silence
while
anthony
robeson
his
own
face
growing
pale
with
the
immensity
of
the
stakes
for
which
he
played
made
his
last
venture
the
little
home
is
only
for
you
juliet
if
you
wo
share
it
with
me
it
shall
be
closed
and
sold
perhaps
it
was
an
audacious
thing
to
do
it
has
come
over
me
a
great
many
times
that
it
was
too
audacious
ever
to
be
forgiven
but
i
could
help
the
hope
that
if
you
should
make
the
home
yourself
you
might
come
to
feel
that
life
with
a
man
who
had
his
way
to
make
could
be
borne
after
all
if
you
loved
him
enough
it
all
depended
on
that
as
i
said
i
did
mean
to
be
presumptuous
but
it
was
a
desperate
chance
with
me
dear
i
could
give
you
up
and
i
thought
perhaps
just
you
cared
more
than
you
knew
anyhow
i
loved
you
so
i
had
to
risk
it
juliet
charming
brown
head
was
buried
so
deep
in
the
pillows
that
only
its
back
with
the
masses
of
waving
hair
was
visible
but
up
from
the
depths
came
a
smothered
question
the
photograph
anthony
face
lightened
as
if
the
sun
had
struck
it
but
he
kept
his
voice
quiet
borrowed
it
my
old
friend
dennison
i
never
even
saw
the
girl
though
i
ought
to
beg
her
pardon
for
the
use
i
have
made
of
her
face
she
married
now
and
lives
abroad
somewhere
will
you
forgive
me
he
was
standing
over
her
leaning
down
so
that
his
cheek
touched
the
rumpled
hair
how
is
it
juliet
could
you
live
in
the
little
home
with
love
and
me
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
got
any
answer
but
at
last
a
flushed
wet
radiant
face
came
into
view
an
arm
was
reached
out
and
as
with
an
inarticulate
deep
note
of
joy
he
drew
her
up
into
his
embrace
a
voice
half
tears
half
laughter
cried
oh
tony
you
dear
bad
darling
insolent
boy
i
did
think
i
could
do
without
you
but
i
ca
and
oh
tony
she
was
sobbing
in
his
arms
now
while
he
regarded
the
top
of
her
head
with
laughing
exultant
eyes
so
glad
so
glad
there
is
any
eleanor
langham
oh
i
hated
her
did
you
sweetheart
he
answered
laughing
aloud
now
then
bending
with
his
lips
close
to
hers
well
to
tell
the
truth
to
tell
the
honest
truth
little
girl
did
an
argument
without
logic
i
do
like
it
repeated
horatio
marcy
obstinately
and
shook
his
head
for
the
fifth
time
i
not
a
word
to
say
against
anthony
my
dear
not
a
word
he
a
fine
fellow
and
comes
of
a
good
family
and
i
respect
him
and
the
start
he
has
made
since
things
went
to
pieces
but
juliet
waited
her
eyes
downcast
her
cheeks
very
much
flushed
her
mouth
in
lines
of
mutiny
but
her
father
continued
settling
back
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
decision
you
will
certainly
make
the
mistake
of
your
life
if
you
think
you
can
be
happy
in
the
sort
of
existence
he
offers
you
you
not
used
to
it
you
not
been
brought
up
to
it
you
can
spend
more
money
in
a
forenoon
than
he
can
earn
in
a
you
do
know
how
to
adapt
yourself
to
life
on
a
basis
of
rigid
economy
i
you
do
forbid
it
sir
forbid
it
no
a
man
ca
forbid
a
year
old
woman
to
do
as
she
pleases
but
i
advise
you
i
warn
you
i
ask
you
seriously
to
consider
what
it
all
means
you
are
used
to
very
many
habits
of
living
which
will
be
entirely
beyond
anthony
means
for
many
years
to
come
you
are
fond
of
travel
of
dress
of
social
father
dear
said
his
daughter
interrupting
him
gently
by
a
change
of
tactics
she
came
to
him
and
sat
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
rested
her
cheek
lightly
upon
the
top
of
his
thick
let
drop
all
this
for
the
present
let
not
discuss
it
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
particular
favour
before
we
say
another
word
about
it
come
with
me
down
to
see
the
house
it
only
three
hours
away
we
can
go
after
breakfast
and
be
back
for
dinner
at
seven
it
all
i
ask
my
arguments
are
all
there
please
so
it
came
about
that
at
eleven
on
a
certain
morning
in
august
horatio
marcy
discovered
himself
to
be
eyeing
with
critical
reluctant
gaze
a
quaintly
attractive
white
house
among
trees
and
vines
he
became
aware
at
the
same
time
of
a
sudden
close
clasp
on
his
arm
here
it
is
said
a
low
voice
in
his
ear
does
it
look
habitable
very
pretty
very
pretty
my
dear
marcy
admitted
no
sane
man
could
do
otherwise
the
little
house
might
have
been
placed
very
comfortably
between
the
walls
of
the
at
the
marcy
country
house
but
there
was
an
indefinable
undeniable
air
of
gracious
hospitality
and
homelikeness
about
its
aspect
and
its
surroundings
gave
it
an
appearance
of
being
ample
for
the
accommodation
of
any
two
people
not
anxious
to
get
away
from
each
other
juliet
produced
an
antique
of
a
clumsy
pattern
and
opened
the
door
into
the
she
ran
across
to
the
windows
and
threw
them
open
then
turned
to
see
what
expression
might
be
at
the
moment
illumining
marcy
face
he
was
glancing
about
him
with
curious
eyes
which
rested
finally
upon
the
portrait
of
a
courtly
gentleman
in
ruffles
and
flowing
hair
hanging
above
the
fireplace
he
adjusted
a
pair
of
eyeglasses
and
gave
the
portrait
the
honour
of
his
serious
attention
that
is
an
ancestor
juliet
explained
does
he
give
distinction
to
the
room
and
is
the
room
well
just
a
little
bit
itself
in
spite
of
its
simplicity
because
of
it
perhaps
the
tables
and
most
of
the
chairs
are
what
anthony
found
left
in
the
old
kentucky
homestead
after
the
sale
last
year
and
bought
in
with
the
last
of
his
money
her
eyes
were
very
bright
but
her
voice
was
quiet
marcy
looked
at
the
furniture
in
question
stared
at
the
walls
then
at
the
rug
on
the
polished
floor
the
rug
held
his
attention
for
two
long
minutes
then
he
glanced
sharply
at
his
daughter
the
colourings
of
that
rug
are
very
good
do
you
think
she
asked
with
composure
it
will
last
until
anthony
can
afford
a
better
one
marcy
turned
significantly
toward
the
door
of
the
and
juliet
led
him
through
he
surveyed
the
room
in
silence
laying
a
hand
upon
a
chair
back
then
looked
suddenly
down
at
the
chair
and
brought
his
eyeglasses
to
bear
upon
it
the
furniture
was
made
by
a
country
who
charged
country
prices
for
doing
it
tony
rubbed
in
a
very
thin
stain
and
rubbed
the
wood
in
oil
afterward
till
it
got
this
soft
polish
the
visitor
looked
incredulous
but
he
accepted
the
explanation
with
a
polite
though
exceedingly
slight
smile
then
he
was
taken
to
inspect
the
kitchen
from
here
he
was
led
through
the
pantry
back
to
the
and
so
upstairs
he
looked
still
silently
in
at
the
door
of
each
room
exquisite
in
its
dainty
readiness
for
occupancy
as
he
studied
the
room
his
daughter
observed
that
he
retained
less
of
the
air
of
the
connoisseur
than
he
had
elsewhere
exhibited
she
had
shown
him
this
place
last
with
artful
intent
no
room
in
his
own
homes
of
luxury
could
appeal
to
him
with
more
of
beauty
than
was
visible
here
when
marcy
reached
the
again
he
found
himself
placed
gently
but
insistently
in
the
easiest
chair
the
room
afforded
close
by
an
open
window
through
which
floated
all
the
soft
odours
of
country
air
blowing
lightly
across
apple
orchards
and
gardens
of
flowers
his
daughter
bringing
from
the
ingle
seat
a
plump
cushion
dropped
upon
it
at
his
feet
but
instead
of
beginning
any
sort
of
argument
she
laid
her
arm
upon
his
knee
and
her
head
down
upon
her
arm
and
became
as
still
as
a
kitten
who
has
composed
itself
for
sleep
only
through
the
contact
of
the
warm
young
arm
her
father
could
feel
that
she
was
alive
and
waiting
for
his
speech
when
he
spoke
at
last
it
was
with
grave
quiet
in
a
gentler
tone
than
that
which
he
had
used
the
day
before
in
his
own
library
you
helped
anthony
furnish
this
house
yes
father
do
you
mind
telling
me
how
much
you
had
at
your
disposal
five
hundred
dollars
juliet
maintained
her
position
without
moving
and
her
face
was
out
of
sight
did
this
include
the
repairs
upon
the
place
yes
but
you
know
wages
are
low
just
now
and
lumber
is
cheap
having
no
roof
to
the
porch
made
it
inexpensive
the
painting
anthony
helped
at
himself
he
worked
every
minute
of
his
two
weeks
vacation
on
whatever
would
cost
most
to
hire
done
anthony
worked
at
painting
the
house
there
was
astonishment
in
marcy
voice
he
had
known
the
robesons
of
kentucky
all
his
life
he
had
never
seen
one
of
them
lift
his
hand
to
do
manual
labour
there
had
been
no
need
yes
said
juliet
and
the
cheek
which
rested
against
her
father
knee
began
to
grow
warm
you
have
obtained
a
somewhat
extraordinary
effect
of
harmony
and
comfort
inside
the
house
marcy
pursued
it
is
difficult
to
understand
just
how
you
brought
it
about
with
so
small
an
expenditure
of
money
it
was
quite
impossible
now
for
juliet
to
keep
her
head
down
she
looked
up
eagerly
but
she
still
managed
to
speak
quietly
it
effect
father
and
it
is
art
not
money
the
paper
on
the
wall
cost
cents
a
roll
but
it
is
the
right
paper
for
the
place
and
the
wrong
paper
at
ten
times
that
sum
would
give
the
room
such
a
background
of
soft
restfulness
then
you
see
the
old
white
woodwork
is
in
very
good
style
and
the
green
walls
bring
it
out
the
old
floor
was
easily
dressed
to
give
that
beautiful
waxed
finish
they
told
me
how
to
do
that
at
the
best
decorator
in
boston
the
rug
fits
the
colourings
very
well
anthony
old
furniture
would
give
any
such
room
dignity
the
portrait
lends
the
finishing
touch
i
think
you
see
when
you
analyse
it
all
there
nothing
in
the
least
wonderful
but
it
looks
like
a
home
does
it
and
when
the
little
things
are
in
which
grow
in
a
home
the
photographs
a
bowl
of
from
the
garden
the
lovely
old
copper
lamp
you
gave
me
on
my
birthday
ca
you
think
how
dear
it
will
all
be
marcy
glanced
down
keenly
into
his
daughter
face
there
are
a
great
many
things
of
your
own
at
home
which
would
naturally
come
into
your
married
home
he
said
juliet
coloured
richly
yes
she
answered
with
steady
eyes
but
except
for
the
lamp
and
the
photographs
and
a
few
such
very
little
things
i
should
not
bring
them
anthony
is
poor
but
he
is
very
proud
i
hurt
him
by
furnishing
his
home
with
the
overflow
of
mine
besides
i
do
need
those
things
i
do
want
them
all
i
want
out
of
the
old
home
is
your
love
your
blessing
dear
the
sharp
eyes
meeting
hers
softened
suddenly
juliet
drew
herself
to
her
knees
and
leaning
forward
across
her
father
lap
reached
both
arms
up
and
flung
them
about
his
neck
he
held
her
close
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
all
at
once
he
found
the
slender
figure
in
his
arms
shaken
with
feeling
juliet
was
not
crying
but
she
was
drawing
long
deep
breaths
like
a
child
who
tries
to
control
itself
you
need
have
no
doubt
of
either
of
those
things
my
little
girl
said
her
father
in
her
ear
both
are
ready
it
is
only
your
happiness
i
want
i
distrust
the
power
of
any
poor
man
to
give
it
to
you
that
is
all
since
i
have
seen
this
house
the
question
looks
less
doubtful
to
me
i
admit
that
gladly
but
i
still
am
anxious
for
the
future
even
in
this
attractive
place
there
must
be
monotony
drudgery
lack
of
many
things
you
have
always
had
and
felt
you
must
have
you
have
never
learned
to
do
without
them
i
understand
that
robeson
will
not
accept
them
at
my
hand
nor
at
yours
i
do
know
that
i
think
the
less
of
him
for
that
but
you
will
have
to
learn
i
want
you
to
be
very
sure
that
you
can
do
it
and
that
it
will
be
worth
while
there
was
a
little
silence
then
juliet
gently
drew
herself
away
and
rose
to
her
feet
she
stood
looking
down
at
the
imposing
figure
of
the
elderly
man
in
the
chair
and
there
was
something
in
her
face
he
had
never
seen
there
before
there
just
one
thing
about
it
sir
she
said
i
ca
possibly
spare
anthony
robeson
out
of
my
life
i
tried
to
do
it
and
i
know
i
would
rather
live
it
out
in
this
little
home
with
him
than
share
the
most
promising
future
with
any
other
man
but
there
this
you
must
remember
a
man
who
was
brought
up
to
do
nothing
but
ride
fine
horses
and
shoot
and
dance
must
have
something
in
him
to
go
to
work
and
advance
and
earn
enough
to
buy
even
such
a
home
as
this
in
five
years
he
has
a
future
of
his
own
marcy
looked
thoughtful
yes
that
may
be
true
he
said
i
rather
think
it
is
and
father
she
bent
to
lay
a
roseleaf
cheek
against
his
own
you
began
with
mother
in
a
poorer
home
than
this
and
were
so
happy
do
i
know
that
yes
yes
dear
he
sighed
that
true
too
but
we
were
both
poor
had
always
been
so
it
was
an
advance
for
us
not
a
coming
down
it
no
coming
down
for
me
there
was
spirit
and
fire
in
the
girl
eyes
now
just
to
wear
less
costly
clothes
to
walk
instead
of
drive
to
live
on
simpler
food
what
are
those
things
look
at
these
she
pointed
to
the
rows
of
books
in
the
bookcases
which
lined
two
walls
of
the
room
marrying
a
man
of
refinement
of
family
of
the
sort
of
blood
that
tells
he
an
educated
man
he
loves
the
things
those
books
stand
for
he
good
and
strong
and
fine
and
if
i
not
safe
with
him
i
never
be
safe
with
anybody
but
besides
all
that
i
i
love
him
with
all
there
is
of
me
oh
you
satisfied
now
blushing
furiously
she
turned
away
her
father
got
to
his
feet
stood
looking
after
her
a
moment
with
something
very
tender
coming
into
his
eyes
then
took
a
step
toward
her
and
gathered
her
into
his
arms
on
account
of
the
this
is
the
nineteenth
day
of
august
observed
anthony
robeson
we
finished
furnishing
the
house
for
my
future
bride
on
the
third
day
of
the
month
over
two
weeks
have
gone
by
since
then
the
place
must
need
dusting
he
glanced
casually
at
the
figure
in
white
which
sat
just
above
him
upon
the
step
of
the
great
porch
at
the
back
of
the
marcy
country
house
it
was
past
twilight
the
moon
was
not
yet
up
and
only
the
glow
from
a
distant
shaded
lamp
at
the
other
end
of
the
porch
served
to
give
him
a
hint
as
to
the
expression
upon
his
companion
face
i
beginning
to
lie
awake
nights
he
continued
trying
to
remember
just
how
my
little
home
looks
i
ca
recall
whether
we
set
the
on
the
stove
or
left
it
in
the
can
you
think
you
put
it
on
the
stove
yourself
said
juliet
you
would
have
filled
it
if
auntie
dingley
had
told
you
it
would
rust
anthony
swerved
about
upon
the
heavy
oriental
rug
which
covered
the
steps
until
his
back
rested
against
the
column
he
clasped
his
arms
about
one
knee
and
inclined
his
head
at
the
precise
angle
which
would
enable
him
to
study
continuously
the
shadowy
outlines
of
the
face
above
him
shot
across
with
a
ruby
ray
from
the
lamp
i
wish
i
could
recollect
he
pursued
whether
i
left
the
porch
awning
up
or
down
it
has
rained
three
times
in
the
two
weeks
it
ought
not
to
be
down
i
sure
it
is
juliet
assured
him
there
was
a
hint
of
laughter
in
her
voice
it
was
rather
absurd
to
put
up
that
awning
at
all
i
suppose
but
when
you
ca
afford
a
roof
to
your
piazza
and
compromise
on
an
awning
instead
you
naturally
want
to
see
how
it
is
going
to
look
and
you
rush
it
up
besides
i
think
there
was
a
strong
impression
on
my
mind
that
only
a
few
days
intervened
before
our
occupancy
of
the
place
it
shows
how
misled
one
can
be
there
was
no
reply
to
this
observation
made
in
a
depressed
tone
after
a
minute
anthony
went
on
these
cares
of
the
householder
they
absorb
me
i
always
wondering
if
the
lawn
needs
mowing
and
if
the
new
roof
leaks
i
get
anxious
about
the
blinds
do
any
of
them
work
loose
and
swing
around
and
bang
their
lives
out
in
the
night
have
the
neighbours
chickens
rooted
up
that
row
of
hollyhock
seeds
then
those
books
i
placed
on
the
shelves
so
hurriedly
are
any
of
them
by
chance
upside
down
is
volume
elbowed
by
volume
ii
or
by
volume
and
i
ca
get
away
to
see
coming
up
here
every
saturday
night
and
tearing
back
every
sunday
midnight
takes
all
my
time
you
might
spend
next
sunday
in
the
new
house
alone
of
course
you
have
so
many
cares
they
would
keep
you
from
getting
lonely
anthony
made
no
immediate
answer
to
this
suggestion
beyond
laughing
up
at
his
companion
in
the
dim
light
for
an
instant
then
growing
immediately
sober
again
but
presently
he
began
upon
a
new
aspect
of
the
subject
juliet
are
we
to
be
married
in
church
tony
i
do
know
but
what
do
you
think
i
do
think
what
do
you
mean
that
of
course
you
do
well
what
about
it
i
do
know
are
we
to
have
a
big
wedding
do
you
want
one
i
but
that
not
the
question
do
you
want
a
big
wedding
she
hesitated
an
instant
then
she
answered
softly
but
with
decision
no
anthony
drew
a
long
breath
thank
the
lord
he
said
devoutly
why
she
asked
in
some
surprise
i
never
exactly
understood
why
the
boys
i
been
best
man
for
were
so
miserable
over
the
prospect
of
a
show
wedding
but
i
know
now
a
runaway
marriage
appeals
to
me
now
as
it
never
did
before
i
want
to
be
married
tremendously
but
i
want
to
get
it
over
a
soft
laugh
answered
him
we
get
it
over
anthony
sat
up
suddenly
will
we
he
asked
with
eagerness
when
i
did
say
juliet
when
are
you
going
to
say
it
why
tony
dear
that
right
put
in
the
he
murmured
i
heard
mighty
few
of
yet
and
they
sound
great
to
me
we
been
engaged
only
two
weeks
and
two
days
and
the
little
house
is
spoiling
even
though
you
not
sure
about
the
and
the
awning
i
you
do
want
to
hurry
things
do
i
rebelliously
if
i
very
good
and
say
great
cæsar
but
tony
now
see
here
he
leaned
forward
and
stared
up
at
her
without
touching
her
he
was
as
yet
allowed
few
of
the
lover
favours
and
prized
them
the
more
for
that
do
you
think
our
case
is
just
like
other
people
here
i
been
waiting
for
you
all
my
days
waiting
and
waiting
and
tortured
all
the
time
by
suspense
then
i
lived
that
month
of
july
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
you
never
know
what
you
put
me
through
those
days
talking
and
jollying
about
langham
and
never
for
one
instant
until
just
that
last
day
giving
me
the
smallest
pinch
of
hope
that
it
was
anything
to
you
except
just
what
it
pretended
to
be
then
i
been
a
long
time
without
a
home
and
the
little
house
sweetheart
it
looks
like
heaven
to
me
must
i
stay
outside
till
christmas
when
everything
all
ready
confound
it
i
do
want
to
play
the
pathetic
string
and
the
lord
knows
i
happy
as
a
fellow
can
be
who
got
the
desire
of
his
life
but
a
warm
hand
came
gently
upon
his
hair
and
for
joy
at
the
touch
he
fell
silent
once
he
turned
his
head
and
put
his
lips
against
the
white
sleeve
as
it
fell
near
and
looked
up
an
instant
with
eyes
whose
expression
the
person
above
him
felt
rather
than
saw
through
the
subdued
light
by
and
by
she
took
up
the
conversation
so
you
are
rejoiced
that
i
do
want
a
great
wedding
immensely
relieved
what
would
you
like
best
i
do
dare
tell
you
you
may
tell
me
what
you
would
like
julie
of
course
father
would
say
the
town
house
even
if
it
were
a
small
affair
auntie
dingley
would
probably
agree
to
having
it
here
if
that
were
what
you
we
wanted
that
is
anthony
looked
up
quickly
even
at
christmas
why
yes
we
could
come
back
people
do
that
sometimes
yes
must
we
do
what
other
people
do
would
you
rather
not
ten
thousand
times
it
seems
to
me
that
the
biggest
mistake
people
make
is
the
way
they
do
this
thing
juliet
think
of
the
little
house
we
made
it
you
made
it
for
years
without
doubt
it
to
hold
us
and
our
experiences
do
you
know
i
like
to
give
it
this
one
to
begin
with
holding
my
breath
plainly
she
was
holding
hers
her
head
was
turned
away
he
could
just
see
her
profile
outlined
against
the
ruby
light
and
at
the
moment
there
were
footsteps
inside
a
long
french
window
near
at
hand
which
lay
open
into
the
library
horatio
marcy
came
out
and
stood
still
just
behind
them
anthony
sprang
to
his
feet
and
came
forward
up
the
steps
the
older
man
greeted
him
cordially
anthony
pulled
a
big
chair
into
position
and
marcy
sat
down
he
was
smoking
and
wore
an
air
of
relaxation
he
and
his
guest
fell
to
talking
the
younger
man
entering
into
the
conversation
with
as
much
ease
and
spirit
as
if
he
were
not
fresh
from
what
was
to
him
at
this
hour
a
much
more
interesting
discussion
juliet
sat
quietly
and
listened
it
grew
into
an
absorbing
argument
after
a
little
the
two
men
taking
opposite
sides
of
a
great
governmental
question
just
then
claiming
public
interest
dingley
came
out
and
joined
the
group
and
she
and
juliet
listened
with
increasing
delight
in
a
contest
of
brains
such
as
was
now
offered
them
marcy
himself
while
he
put
forth
his
arguments
with
conviction
and
with
skill
was
evidently
enjoying
the
keen
wit
and
wisdom
of
his
young
opponent
the
elder
man
met
objection
with
objection
set
up
men
of
straw
to
be
knocked
down
and
ended
at
last
with
a
hearty
laugh
and
a
frankly
appreciative
well
anthony
you
have
convinced
me
of
one
thing
certainly
there
are
more
sides
to
the
question
than
i
had
understood
i
will
admit
that
made
a
strong
argument
but
when
i
come
back
i
down
you
with
fresh
material
i
shall
have
plenty
of
it
are
you
going
away
soon
sir
anthony
asked
with
some
surprise
marcy
was
a
frequent
traveller
preferring
to
look
after
various
business
interests
in
faraway
ports
himself
rather
than
entrust
them
to
others
yes
i
shall
be
off
in
a
few
weeks
and
for
a
longer
time
than
usual
i
have
told
these
ladies
of
my
household
yet
but
this
is
as
good
a
time
as
any
juliet
little
girl
i
may
be
gone
all
winter
this
time
she
came
quickly
to
him
without
speaking
and
gave
him
her
regretful
answer
silently
when
do
you
go
horatio
dingley
asked
about
the
first
of
october
i
had
fully
decided
till
i
had
thought
of
inviting
you
two
to
go
with
me
he
looked
with
a
smile
at
his
sister
and
his
daughter
then
somewhat
quizzically
at
anthony
the
latter
was
regarding
him
with
an
alert
face
in
which
as
nearly
as
could
be
made
out
in
the
dim
light
were
no
signs
of
discomfiture
horatio
said
dingley
i
wish
you
would
come
into
the
library
for
a
few
minutes
this
reminds
me
of
a
letter
i
had
from
one
of
your
old
friends
asking
when
you
were
to
be
at
home
the
french
window
closed
on
the
two
older
people
juliet
left
sitting
on
the
arm
of
her
father
chair
found
anthony
behind
her
do
you
want
to
go
on
a
voyage
to
the
philippines
he
was
asking
over
her
shoulder
i
not
sure
just
what
i
do
want
she
answered
rather
breathlessly
the
would
rust
while
you
were
gone
he
got
no
reply
the
dust
would
grow
inches
deep
on
the
we
polished
so
carefully
juliet
rose
and
walked
slowly
to
the
edge
of
the
steps
anthony
followed
let
go
and
walk
on
the
terrace
he
proposed
and
they
ran
down
to
the
smooth
sward
below
it
was
a
warm
night
with
no
dew
and
the
grass
was
dry
all
the
stars
were
out
anthony
walked
beside
the
figure
in
white
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
do
white
ruffled
curtains
like
those
at
our
windows
ever
grow
musty
from
being
shut
up
he
insinuated
gently
i
do
know
will
you
write
from
every
port
you
touch
at
it
will
take
a
good
many
letters
to
satisfy
me
i
suppose
so
suppose
what
that
you
will
write
juliet
stood
still
you
the
greatest
wheedler
i
ever
saw
she
said
is
that
a
compliment
it
not
meant
for
one
what
am
i
to
do
when
i
married
to
me
i
do
know
poor
child
i
can
only
pity
you
what
do
you
think
the
prospect
is
for
me
never
to
be
able
to
get
the
smallest
concession
from
you
except
by
every
art
of
coaxing
yet
if
i
can
get
this
thing
i
want
by
any
means
i
warn
you
i
shall
not
give
up
until
i
seen
you
sail
you
not
see
me
sail
he
wheeled
upon
her
he
had
her
hand
in
his
grasp
and
if
you
do
go
i
stay
with
me
she
laughed
irresistibly
how
could
i
stay
without
you
will
you
marry
me
before
your
father
goes
oh
tony
tony
we
ca
be
married
without
his
blessing
can
we
no
dear
father
then
i
tell
you
said
she
a
bishop
and
a
juliet
marcy
prospective
found
anthony
robeson
best
man
at
her
elbow
the
moment
she
entered
the
of
the
big
railway
station
now
although
she
greeted
him
with
a
charming
little
conscious
look
there
was
nothing
either
new
or
singular
about
the
quiet
rush
he
had
made
across
the
the
instant
he
saw
her
the
rest
of
the
party
of
twenty
people
who
were
going
down
into
the
country
to
the
wedding
understood
it
perfectly
although
the
engagement
had
not
been
announced
and
probably
would
not
be
until
wayne
carey
should
have
an
income
decidedly
larger
than
he
had
at
present
judith
dearborn
joined
the
group
at
once
and
carey
reluctantly
followed
her
judith
had
a
way
of
joining
groups
and
of
giving
her
betrothed
many
impatient
thereby
just
think
of
this
she
said
to
the
others
when
i
knew
juliet
had
really
given
in
to
anthony
robeson
at
last
i
thought
i
should
be
asked
to
assist
at
an
impressive
church
wedding
but
here
we
are
going
down
to
what
tony
describes
as
box
of
a
house
in
the
most
rural
of
suburbs
if
really
as
small
as
he
says
even
twenty
people
will
be
a
tight
fit
how
in
the
world
did
they
come
to
be
married
there
asked
the
sister
of
the
best
man
everybody
had
been
summoned
to
this
wedding
so
hurriedly
and
so
informally
that
nobody
knew
much
about
it
the
son
of
the
bishop
whose
father
was
going
down
to
perform
the
ceremony
answered
promptly
tony
tells
me
its
juliet
own
choice
you
see
they
furnished
the
house
together
with
her
aunt
dingley
and
juliet
fell
so
in
love
with
it
that
she
must
needs
be
married
in
it
what
occurred
to
that
girl
i
know
after
the
robesons
of
kentucky
lost
their
money
and
everything
else
but
their
social
standing
i
thought
it
was
all
up
with
anthony
but
plucky
he
made
a
way
for
himself
and
he
won
juliet
somehow
he
seems
to
be
a
late
edition
of
that
obstinate
chap
who
remarked
will
find
a
way
or
make
one
by
jove
he
must
have
made
one
when
he
convinced
juliet
marcy
that
she
could
be
happy
in
a
house
where
twenty
people
are
a
tight
fit
when
the
train
stopped
at
the
small
station
judith
dearborn
said
in
wayne
carey
ear
as
he
glanced
wonderingly
from
the
train
is
this
it
juliet
marcy
must
be
perfectly
crazy
she
certainly
must
admitted
robeson
best
man
but
he
stifled
a
sigh
if
juliet
marcy
could
do
so
crazy
a
thing
as
to
marry
anthony
robeson
on
the
comparatively
small
salary
that
young
man
brought
up
to
do
nothing
at
all
was
now
earning
why
must
wayne
carey
wait
for
several
times
that
income
before
he
could
have
juliet
closest
friend
was
there
really
such
a
difference
in
girls
but
at
the
next
instant
he
was
shouting
hilariously
and
so
was
everybody
else
except
the
bishop
and
the
bishop
wife
who
only
smiled
indulgently
the
rest
of
the
party
were
young
people
and
their
glee
brooked
no
repression
the
moment
they
reached
the
little
platform
they
comprehended
not
only
that
they
were
coming
to
a
most
informal
wedding
they
were
also
in
for
a
decidedly
novel
lark
close
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
stood
a
great
cushioned
with
fragrant
hay
and
garlanded
with
goldenrod
and
purple
asters
standing
erect
on
the
front
one
hand
grasping
the
reins
which
reached
out
over
a
of
big
farm
horses
the
other
waving
a
triumphant
greeting
to
his
friends
was
anthony
robeson
in
white
from
head
to
foot
his
face
alight
with
happiness
and
fun
he
looked
like
a
young
king
there
could
be
no
other
comparison
for
his
splendid
outlines
as
he
towered
there
and
better
yet
he
looked
as
he
had
ever
looked
through
prosperity
and
through
poverty
like
a
robeson
of
kentucky
below
him
prettier
than
she
had
ever
been
and
that
was
saying
much
her
eyes
brilliant
with
the
spirit
of
the
day
laughing
dressed
also
in
white
a
big
white
hat
drooping
over
her
brown
curls
stood
juliet
marcy
in
a
storm
of
salutations
and
congratulations
the
guests
rushed
toward
this
extraordinary
equipage
and
the
radiant
pair
who
were
its
charioteers
all
regrets
over
the
probable
commonplaceness
of
a
small
country
wedding
had
vanished
illustration
standing
erect
one
hand
grasping
the
reins
was
anthony
robeson
might
have
known
they
would
do
things
up
in
shape
somehow
grunted
the
bishop
son
approvingly
this
is
the
stuff
conventionality
be
tabooed
they
going
to
the
other
extreme
and
that
the
way
to
do
if
you
want
an
altar
and
candles
and
a
at
the
organ
have
a
let
me
get
up
here
next
to
ben
hur
and
the
lady
even
the
bishop
sitting
with
clerical
carefully
parted
his
handsome
face
beaming
benevolently
from
under
his
round
hat
and
bishop
granted
by
special
dispensation
a
cushion
upon
the
hay
seat
enjoyed
that
drive
anthony
plying
a
long
beribboned
lash
aroused
his
steeds
into
an
exhilarating
trot
and
the
carrying
safely
its
crew
of
young
society
people
in
their
gayest
mood
swept
over
the
from
the
station
to
the
house
like
a
royal
barge
as
they
drew
up
a
chorus
of
oh
not
merely
polite
but
sincerely
surprised
and
admiring
recognised
the
quaint
beauty
of
the
little
house
it
was
no
commonplace
country
home
now
though
the
changes
wrought
had
been
comparatively
slight
it
looked
as
if
it
might
have
stood
for
years
in
just
this
fashion
yet
it
was
as
far
removed
from
its
primitive
characterless
condition
as
may
be
an
artist
drawing
of
a
face
upon
which
he
has
altered
but
a
line
dingley
and
horatio
marcy
a
pair
whose
presence
anywhere
would
have
been
a
voucher
for
the
decorum
of
the
most
unconventional
proceedings
welcomed
the
party
upon
the
wide
uncovered
porch
we
going
to
be
married
very
soon
to
have
it
over
called
anthony
but
you
may
explore
the
house
first
so
your
minds
shall
be
at
rest
during
the
crisis
just
do
wander
too
far
away
in
examining
this
ancestral
mansion
there
are
six
rooms
i
should
advise
your
going
in
line
otherwise
complications
may
occur
in
the
upper
hall
please
all
try
to
get
into
the
kitchen
at
once
it
ca
be
done
it
will
hold
juliet
and
me
at
the
same
time
all
the
rooms
have
been
stretched
to
do
that
they
had
to
be
but
i
not
sure
as
to
their
capacity
for
more
now
make
yourselves
absolutely
at
home
the
place
is
yours
for
a
few
hours
after
that
it
mine
and
juliet
he
glanced
laughing
at
his
bride
as
he
spoke
from
where
he
stood
in
the
doorway
she
was
on
the
little
landing
of
the
staircase
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
she
looked
down
and
across
at
him
and
nearly
everybody
in
the
room
they
were
thronging
through
at
the
moment
caught
that
glance
she
was
smiling
back
at
him
and
her
eyes
lingered
only
an
instant
after
they
met
his
but
her
friends
all
saw
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
juliet
marcy
who
since
she
had
laid
aside
her
pinafores
had
kept
many
men
at
bay
had
at
last
surrendered
as
for
anthony
why
he
always
been
in
love
with
her
said
the
bishop
son
in
the
ear
of
the
best
man
as
in
accordance
with
their
host
permission
they
peeped
admiringly
in
at
the
little
kitchen
but
any
idiot
can
see
that
fairly
off
his
feet
now
ideal
condition
eh
say
this
great
jove
it
is
i
going
to
get
asked
out
here
to
dinner
as
soon
as
they
are
back
let
go
upstairs
the
girls
are
just
coming
down
hear
gurgling
over
what
they
saw
upstairs
the
best
man
looked
in
at
the
room
with
eyes
which
one
with
penetration
might
have
said
were
envious
indeed
he
stared
at
everything
with
much
the
same
expression
he
was
the
soberest
man
present
ordinarily
he
could
be
counted
on
to
enliven
such
occasions
but
his
fits
of
hilarity
were
only
momentary
and
during
the
intervals
he
was
observed
by
the
bishop
son
to
be
gazing
somewhat
yearningly
into
space
with
an
abstraction
new
to
him
nobody
knew
just
how
the
moment
for
the
ceremony
arrived
but
when
the
survey
of
the
house
was
over
and
everybody
had
instinctively
come
back
to
the
the
affair
was
brought
about
most
naturally
the
bishop
at
a
word
from
the
best
man
took
his
place
in
the
doorway
opening
upon
the
porch
which
had
been
set
in
a
great
nodding
border
of
goldenrod
anthony
making
his
way
among
his
guests
came
with
a
quiet
face
up
to
juliet
and
bending
said
softly
now
dear
a
hush
followed
instantly
and
the
guests
fell
back
to
places
at
the
sides
of
the
room
best
man
was
at
his
elbow
and
the
two
went
over
to
the
bishop
to
stand
by
his
side
marcy
moved
quietly
into
his
place
juliet
with
judith
who
had
kept
beside
her
walked
across
the
floor
and
anthony
meeting
her
led
her
a
step
farther
to
face
the
bishop
it
was
but
a
suggestion
of
the
usual
convention
and
anthony
in
his
white
clothes
surrounded
as
he
was
by
men
in
was
assuredly
the
most
unconventional
bridegroom
that
had
ever
been
seen
juliet
too
wore
the
simplest
of
white
gowns
with
no
other
adornment
than
that
of
her
own
beauty
yet
somehow
as
the
guests
grown
sober
in
an
instant
looked
on
and
noted
these
things
there
was
not
one
who
felt
that
either
grace
or
dignity
was
lacking
the
rich
voice
of
the
bishop
was
as
impressive
as
it
had
ever
been
in
chancel
or
at
altar
the
look
on
anthony
face
was
one
which
fitted
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
his
vows
and
juliet
giving
herself
to
the
man
whose
altered
fortunes
she
was
agreeing
to
share
bore
a
loveliness
which
made
her
a
bride
one
would
remember
long
and
envy
there
that
done
said
the
bishop
son
with
a
gusty
sigh
of
relief
which
brought
the
laugh
so
necessary
to
the
relaxing
of
the
tension
which
accompanies
such
scenes
jove
it
a
good
thing
to
see
a
fellow
like
robeson
safely
tied
up
at
last
you
never
can
tell
where
these
quixotic
ideas
about
houses
and
and
weddings
may
lead
it
a
terrible
strain
though
to
see
people
married
i
always
tremble
like
a
leaf
i
weigh
only
a
hundred
and
now
and
these
things
affect
me
it
so
frightful
to
think
what
might
happen
if
they
should
trip
up
on
their
specifications
there
was
a
simple
wedding
breakfast
served
by
whom
nobody
could
tell
it
was
eaten
out
in
the
orchard
a
pleasant
place
for
the
neglected
grass
had
been
close
cut
and
an
garden
at
one
side
perfumed
the
air
with
late
september
flowers
the
trim
little
country
maids
who
brought
the
plates
came
from
a
path
which
led
presumably
to
the
next
house
some
distance
down
the
road
there
were
several
innovations
in
the
various
dishes
delicious
to
taste
altogether
it
was
a
little
feast
which
everybody
enjoyed
with
unusual
zest
and
the
life
of
the
party
was
the
bridegroom
i
never
saw
a
fellow
able
to
scintillate
like
that
at
his
own
wedding
remarked
the
son
of
the
bishop
to
the
best
man
sister
usually
they
are
so
completely
dashed
by
their
own
temerity
in
getting
into
such
an
irretrievable
situation
that
they
sit
with
their
ears
drooping
and
their
eyes
bleared
do
you
suppose
it
getting
married
in
tennis
clothes
done
it
tennis
clothes
cried
the
best
man
sister
with
a
merry
laugh
if
you
realised
how
much
handsomer
he
looks
than
you
men
in
your
you
would
not
make
fun
make
fun
repeated
the
bishop
son
solemnly
i
joke
only
to
keep
my
head
above
water
i
never
in
my
life
was
so
completely
submerged
in
the
desire
to
get
married
instantly
and
live
in
a
picturesque
nothing
can
keep
me
from
it
longer
than
it
takes
to
find
the
girl
and
the
if
if
his
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
and
a
hint
of
redness
crept
into
his
face
which
belied
his
jesting
words
you
knew
of
the
girl
i
er
say
should
you
mind
living
in
a
the
best
man
sister
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
can
discern
when
even
an
inveterate
joker
is
daring
to
be
somewhat
more
than
half
in
earnest
and
she
flushed
so
prettily
that
the
son
of
the
bishop
caught
her
hand
boyishly
under
the
little
table
he
had
hitherto
been
considered
a
hopeless
old
bachelor
so
it
may
readily
be
seen
that
now
the
contagion
had
caught
him
his
was
quite
a
serious
case
on
a
threshold
when
it
was
all
over
judith
dearborn
went
upstairs
with
juliet
to
help
her
dress
for
her
going
away
the
looked
about
the
room
with
thoughtful
eyes
this
is
certainly
the
dearest
room
i
ever
saw
she
said
oh
juliet
do
you
think
you
really
will
be
happy
here
what
do
you
think
about
it
dear
asked
juliet
oh
i
well
really
i
never
imagined
that
a
little
old
house
like
this
could
be
made
so
awfully
attractive
but
juliet
you
you
must
be
very
very
fond
of
anthony
to
give
up
so
many
things
how
well
he
looked
seems
to
me
he
grown
gloriously
in
every
way
since
he
since
his
family
came
into
so
many
misfortunes
juliet
smiled
but
answered
nothing
and
you
so
different
too
never
in
my
life
would
i
have
imagined
you
having
a
wedding
like
this
and
yet
it
been
absolutely
the
prettiest
one
i
ever
saw
that
a
sweet
gown
to
go
away
in
but
it
the
simplest
thing
you
ever
wore
i
sure
juliet
where
are
you
going
we
are
going
to
drive
through
the
berkshires
in
a
cart
juliet
marcy
corrected
juliet
with
a
little
laugh
but
in
a
tone
which
it
was
a
pity
anthony
could
not
hear
do
forget
that
i
so
proud
of
the
name
and
i
think
a
drive
through
the
berkshires
will
be
a
perfectly
ideal
trip
judith
dearborn
was
not
assisting
the
bride
at
all
instead
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
staring
at
juliet
with
much
the
same
abstraction
of
manner
observable
in
the
best
man
throughout
the
day
of
course
you
did
need
to
live
this
way
observed
miss
dearborn
at
length
you
could
have
afforded
to
live
much
more
expensively
no
i
could
said
juliet
with
a
flash
in
her
eyes
though
she
smiled
i
could
have
afforded
to
do
one
thing
that
would
hurt
tony
pride
why
judith
he
a
of
kentucky
well
he
looks
it
admitted
judith
and
you
a
marcy
of
massachusetts
the
two
go
well
together
juliet
do
you
know
somehow
i
thought
it
was
a
fearful
sacrifice
you
were
making
even
for
such
a
man
as
anthony
but
this
room
ah
this
room
repeated
juliet
then
she
came
over
and
dropped
on
her
knees
by
her
friend
in
her
impulsive
way
and
put
both
arms
around
her
the
plain
little
gown
touched
folds
with
the
one
whose
elegance
was
equalled
only
by
its
cost
anthony
robeson
wife
looked
straight
up
into
the
eyes
of
her
and
whispered
judith
do
put
wayne
and
your
room
off
too
long
you
will
not
be
any
happier
to
wait
if
you
love
him
drawn
up
close
to
the
door
stood
the
cart
beside
it
waited
anthony
around
the
cart
crowded
twenty
people
when
juliet
came
through
them
to
say
the
son
of
the
bishop
murmured
er
robeson
yes
farnham
said
juliet
promptly
her
delicate
flush
answering
the
name
as
it
had
answered
it
many
times
that
day
when
are
you
going
to
be
at
home
to
your
friends
the
fifteenth
day
of
october
said
juliet
and
from
then
on
every
day
in
the
week
every
week
in
the
year
come
and
see
us
everybody
but
expect
any
formal
invitations
i
be
down
declared
the
bishop
son
i
be
down
once
a
week
please
do
stay
long
after
we
are
gone
requested
anthony
putting
his
bride
into
the
cart
and
springing
in
beside
her
he
gathered
up
the
reins
he
called
take
this
next
train
home
it
goes
in
an
hour
lock
the
door
carey
and
hang
the
key
up
in
plain
sight
by
the
window
there
we
live
in
the
country
now
and
that
the
way
we
do
then
he
drove
rapidly
away
down
the
road
and
that
pair
said
the
son
of
the
bishop
gravely
looking
after
them
and
speaking
to
the
company
in
general
married
so
to
speak
in
a
and
going
for
a
wedding
trip
in
a
through
the
berkshires
is
juliet
marcy
and
anthony
robeson
no
my
son
said
the
bishop
slowly
and
everybody
always
listened
when
the
bishop
spoke
it
is
anthony
and
juliet
robeson
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
i
think
two
happier
young
people
i
never
married
and
may
god
be
with
them
the
best
man
said
that
he
and
the
would
walk
the
to
the
station
the
son
of
the
bishop
and
the
sister
of
the
best
man
had
already
taken
this
course
without
saying
anything
about
it
nearly
everybody
murmured
something
about
it
being
a
lovely
evening
and
a
glorious
sunset
and
a
charming
road
and
pairing
off
advisedly
adopted
the
same
plan
the
bishop
and
bishop
dingley
and
marcy
decided
on
being
driven
over
to
the
station
in
a
light
surrey
provided
for
this
anticipated
emergency
the
best
man
and
the
succeeded
in
dropping
behind
the
rest
of
the
pedestrians
their
friends
were
used
to
that
and
let
them
mercifully
alone
mighty
pretty
affair
observed
carey
in
a
melancholy
tone
yes
in
its
way
admitted
judith
dearborn
with
apparent
reluctance
cosy
house
very
tony
seemed
happy
ecstatic
judith
inflection
was
peculiar
nobody
would
have
suspected
juliet
of
feeling
blue
about
living
off
here
she
does
seem
to
what
made
the
difference
anthony
robeson
probably
must
seem
pretty
good
to
him
to
have
her
care
like
that
i
presume
so
it
is
everybody
that
could
inspire
such
an
affection
in
such
a
girl
no
indeed
carey
looked
intensely
gloomy
the
two
walked
on
in
silence
miss
dearborn
studying
the
sunset
carey
studying
miss
dearborn
suddenly
he
spoke
again
judith
do
all
our
plans
for
the
future
seem
as
desirable
to
you
as
they
did
this
morning
which
ones
apartment
in
the
locality
we
picked
out
life
in
the
style
the
locality
calls
for
and
for
it
all
until
i
with
a
burst
of
tremendous
energy
good
heavens
darling
what
the
use
why
if
i
could
have
you
and
a
little
home
like
that
he
bit
his
lip
hard
the
walked
on
her
head
turned
still
farther
away
than
before
they
were
nearing
the
station
just
ahead
lay
a
turn
in
the
road
the
last
turn
the
rest
of
the
party
with
a
shout
back
at
this
dilatory
pair
disappeared
around
it
from
the
distance
came
the
long
shrill
whistle
of
the
approaching
train
the
glanced
behind
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
ahead
and
saw
nothing
to
alarm
a
girl
with
an
impulse
in
her
heart
at
a
point
where
great
masses
of
reddening
sumac
hid
a
little
dip
in
the
road
from
everything
earthly
she
stopped
suddenly
and
turning
put
out
both
hands
she
looked
up
into
a
face
which
warmed
on
the
instant
into
a
joy
and
said
very
gently
you
may
the
sun
had
been
gone
only
two
hours
and
the
soft
early
autumn
darkness
had
but
lately
settled
down
upon
the
silent
little
house
waiting
alone
for
its
owners
to
come
back
some
october
day
when
a
cart
driven
slowly
rolled
along
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
it
stopped
where
are
we
asked
juliet
voice
this
is
a
private
house
i
thought
we
why
tony
do
you
see
we
come
around
in
a
circle
instead
of
going
on
to
that
little
inn
you
spoke
of
this
is
is
it
said
anthony
voice
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
so
it
is
he
leaped
out
and
came
around
to
juliet
side
what
a
fluke
but
the
happy
laugh
in
his
voice
betrayed
him
anthony
robeson
cried
juliet
softly
you
need
not
pretend
to
be
surprised
you
meant
to
do
it
did
i
he
reached
out
both
arms
to
take
her
down
perhaps
i
did
do
you
mind
robeson
shall
we
go
on
juliet
looked
down
at
him
no
i
do
think
i
mind
she
said
he
swung
her
down
and
they
went
slowly
up
the
walk
somehow
said
anthony
robeson
looking
up
at
the
house
lying
as
if
asleep
in
the
september
night
when
i
thought
of
taking
you
to
that
little
public
inn
and
then
remembered
that
we
might
have
this
instead
we
can
go
on
with
our
wedding
journey
he
led
her
silently
upon
the
porch
he
found
the
key
where
in
jest
he
had
bade
his
best
man
put
it
and
unlocked
the
door
and
threw
it
open
he
stepped
first
upon
the
threshold
and
turning
held
out
his
arms
come
he
said
smiling
in
the
darkness
a
bachelor
at
dinner
hallo
there
anthony
robeson
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
you
ca
notice
a
fellow
the
big
figure
rushing
through
the
snow
paused
wheeled
and
thrust
out
a
hand
of
hearty
greeting
that
you
carey
hat
over
your
eyes
like
a
train
robber
electric
lights
all
behind
you
and
you
expect
me
to
smile
at
you
as
i
go
by
how
are
you
how
judith
infernally
lonely
i
mean
i
am
judith
off
on
a
visit
to
her
mother
say
tony

me
home
with
you
will

i
want
some
decent
things
to
eat
so
i
holding
you
up
on
purpose
good
come
on
train
goes
in
a
few
minutes
juliet
will
be
delighted
the
two
hurried
on
together
into
the
station
from
which
the
suburban
trains
were
constantly
leaving
as
they
entered
they
encountered
a
mutual
friend
at
whom
both
flung
themselves
enthusiastically
with
alternate
greetings
roger
barnes
roger
old
fellow
glad
to
see
you
back
patient
safely
landed
get
a
big
fee
where
you
going
let
take
him
home
with
us
tony
the
third
man
looked
smiling
at
tony
i
challenge
you
to
said
he
that
easy
come
on
responded
anthony
robeson
with
cordiality
just
telephone
mrs
robeson
that
it
said
roger
barnes
you
do
dare
not
to
i
understand
go
ahead
but
if
she
too
much
dashed
let
me
know
will
you
anthony
turned
laughing
into
a
telephone
closet
from
which
he
emerged
in
time
to
catch
his
train
with
his
guests
it
all
right
he
assured
them
but
it
only
fair
to
let
her
know
a
few
minutes
ahead
you
like
to
understand
roger
before
you
start
you
whether
your
emergency
case
is
a
or
a
cut
lip
so
you
can
tell
whether
to
take
your
glue
or
your
by
all
means
said
the
bachelor
of
the
party
and
i
suppose
you
think
juliet
marcy
robeson
is
now
smiling
happily
to
herself
over
this
little
surprise
i
lay
you
anything
you
please
that
if
i
can
make
her
own
up
she
admit
that
she
said
heavens
into
the
telephone
when
she
got
your
message
anthony
shook
his
head
evidently
you
do
know
what
guests
in
the
remote
suburbs
on
a
stormy
february
night
mean
to
a
poor
girl
whose
nearest
neighbour
is
five
hundred
feet
away
your
ideas
of
married
life
need
a
little
freshening
too
they
pretty
antique
it
was
a
from
the
station
to
the
house
the
box
of
a
house
which
had
been
anthony
home
for
five
months
and
toward
which
he
now
led
his
friends
with
the
air
of
a
man
about
to
show
his
most
treasured
possessions
he
strode
through
the
deepening
snow
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
strenuous
tramp
setting
a
pace
which
wayne
carey
with
his
office
life
if
not
the
doctor
more
vigorously
built
and
bred
found
difficult
to
maintain
here
we
are
called
the
leader
pointing
toward
windows
glowing
with
a
ruddy
light
the
doctor
looked
up
with
interest
carey
was
a
frequent
visitor
but
the
busy
surgeon
old
chum
of
though
he
was
was
about
to
have
his
first
introduction
to
a
place
of
which
he
had
heard
much
but
of
whose
nearness
to
paradise
he
doubted
with
the
strong
skepticism
of
a
man
who
has
seen
many
a
fair
beginning
end
in
all
unhappiness
and
desolation
as
they
stamped
upon
the
little
porch
the
door
flew
open
the
brilliancy
and
comfort
of
a
room
leaped
out
at
them
a
delicious
faint
odour
of
cookery
assailed
their
hungry
nostrils
and
the
welcome
which
makes
all
worth
having
met
them
on
the
threshold
wayne
said
the
rich
young
voice
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
i
so
glad
roger
barnes
this
is
just
downright
good
of
you
it
so
long
you
promised
us
this
tony
what
she
said
to
tony
must
have
been
whispered
in
his
ear
if
voiced
at
all
for
the
two
guests
looking
on
with
laughing
envious
eyes
saw
their
hostess
swept
unceremoniously
into
a
bearlike
embrace
swung
into
the
air
as
one
thrusts
up
a
child
poised
there
an
instant
laughing
and
protesting
then
slowly
lowered
to
be
kissed
and
set
down
once
more
lightly
upon
the
floor
it
all
right
i
did
tumble
your
hair
a
bit
said
anthony
coolly
excuse
me
gentlemen
but
wayne
understands
and
roger
will
some
day
i
hope
that
a
man
who
has
been
thinking
about
it
all
the
way
home
ca
put
it
off
on
account
of
a
couple
of
idiots
who
stand
and
stare
instead
of
politely
turning
their
backs
oh
do
mention
it
it
does
disturb
me
at
all
and
robeson
is
becoming
reconciled
to
my
impetuosity
by
degrees
make
yourselves
at
home
boys
juliet
take
them
upstairs
tony
please
of
course
we
ca
let
them
go
back
now
we
have
them
it
beginning
to
storm
heavily
is
it
i
thought
so
take
them
to
the
tony
and
dinner
will
be
served
as
soon
as
you
are
down
by
jupiter
i
believe
she
means
it
declared
the
doctor
with
approval
as
the
door
of
the
bedroom
closed
on
his
host
i
think
i
can
tell
when
a
woman
is
shamming
she
improved
has
she
tremendously
pretty
girl
always
but
well
bloomed
now
nice
little
house
believe
i
have
to
stay
though
i
ought
not
just
to
take
observations
on
tony
his
enthusiasm
has
all
the
appearance
of
reality
in
fact
it
strikes
me
he
has
rather
it
was
on
his
lips
to
say
rather
more
than
you
have
but
it
occurred
to
him
in
time
that
jokes
on
this
ground
are
dangerous
wayne
carey
had
been
married
in
november
was
living
in
a
somewhat
unpretentious
way
in
a
downtown
and
certainly
had
so
much
of
a
air
that
it
made
the
doctor
pause
so
he
substituted
rather
more
than
i
should
have
expected
even
of
a
fellow
who
has
got
the
girl
he
has
wanted
all
his
life
and
fell
to
washing
and
brushing
vigorously
eyeing
meanwhile
the
little
room
with
a
critical
bachelor
appreciation
of
beauty
and
comfort
in
the
quarters
he
is
to
occupy
it
was
very
simply
furnished
certainly
but
it
struck
him
as
a
place
where
his
dreams
were
likely
to
be
pleasant
for
every
reason
in
the
world
downstairs
juliet
in
the
was
surveying
her
table
with
the
hostess
satisfaction
opposite
her
stood
a
tall
and
slender
girl
with
a
face
of
great
attractiveness
i
wish
robeson
she
was
saying
eagerly
you
would
let
me
serve
you
as
your
maid
and
not
make
a
guest
of
me
really
i
should
love
to
do
it
i
do
need
to
meet
your
friends
and
i
do
mind
seeming
what
i
really
am
your
rachel
redding
juliet
interrupted
lifting
an
affectionate
glance
across
the
table
if
you
want
to
seem
what
you
really
are
my
friend
you
will
let
me
do
as
i
like
my
shabby
clothes
murmured
the
girl
if
i
could
look
as
much
like
a
princess
as
you
do
in
them
robeson
in
that
lovely
dull
red
you
a
queen
dowager
finished
juliet
gayly
well
i
be
proud
of
you
and
you
can
be
proud
of
me
if
you
like
and
together
we
make
those
hungry
men
think
there
nothing
like
us
the
dinner
the
thing
is
it
the
luckiest
chance
in
the
world
i
sent
for
those
oysters
this
morning
doctor
barnes
is
perfectly
fine
but
he
never
would
believe
in
the
happiness
of
married
life
if
the
coffee
were
poor
or
the
beefsteak
too
much
broiled
does
the
table
look
pretty
those
red
geranium
blossoms
you
brought
me
give
it
just
the
gay
touch
it
needed
this
winter
night
three
men
standing
about
the
wide
fireplace
warming
cold
hands
at
its
friendly
blaze
turned
expectantly
as
their
youthful
hostess
came
in
followed
by
a
graceful
girl
in
gray
juliet
presented
her
guests
with
the
air
of
conferring
upon
them
a
favour
and
they
seemed
quite
ready
to
accept
it
as
such
anthony
looked
on
with
interest
to
see
a
person
whom
he
had
known
hitherto
only
as
a
pretty
but
poor
young
neighbour
whom
juliet
had
engaged
to
help
her
for
a
certain
part
of
every
day
introduced
as
his
wife
friend
and
greeted
by
doctor
barnes
and
wayne
carey
with
quite
evident
admiration
and
pleasure
he
looked
hard
at
her
as
carey
seated
her
noticing
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
really
worth
consideration
and
remembering
vaguely
that
juliet
had
more
than
once
tried
to
impress
him
with
the
fact
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
other
fellows
with
whose
eyes
as
their
host
he
was
now
stimulated
to
observe
her
he
might
have
been
still
some
time
longer
in
coming
to
the
realisation
that
juliet
had
found
somebody
in
whom
her
genuine
interest
was
not
misplaced
but
anthony
robeson
had
all
his
life
been
singularly
blind
to
the
fascinations
of
most
other
women
than
juliet
as
he
turned
his
keen
gaze
from
rachel
redding
to
the
charming
figure
that
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
the
satisfaction
in
his
eyes
became
so
pronounced
that
it
could
mean
roger
barnes
admitted
to
himself
as
he
caught
it
nothing
less
than
a
very
real
happiness
it
was
not
an
elaborate
dinner
it
was
not
by
any
means
the
sort
of
dinner
juliet
might
have
prepared
had
she
known
that
morning
whom
she
was
to
entertain
it
was
merely
a
dinner
planned
with
affectionate
care
to
please
and
satisfy
one
hungry
man
who
liked
good
things
to
eat
and
amplified
as
much
as
possible
in
quantity
after
anthony
message
reached
her
and
by
that
admirable
collusion
between
hostess
and
feminine
friend
which
can
sometimes
be
effected
when
the
situation
demands
it
the
dinner
prepared
for
three
seemed
ample
for
five
illustration
three
men
standing
about
the
wide
fireplace
turned
expectantly
as
their
youthful
hostess
came
in
followed
by
a
graceful
girl
in
gray
between
them
juliet
and
rachel
redding
served
the
various
dishes
and
changed
the
plates
which
anthony
handed
from
his
place
it
was
gracefully
done
and
so
simply
that
the
absence
of
a
maid
was
a
thing
to
be
enjoyed
rather
than
regretted
when
juliet
in
the
softly
sweeping
frock
which
made
of
her
a
warm
picture
for
a
winter
night
slipped
from
her
chair
and
moved
about
the
room
or
brought
in
from
the
kitchen
a
steaming
dish
she
seemed
the
ideal
hostess
herself
bestowing
what
her
own
hands
had
prepared
and
when
rachel
redding
offered
a
man
a
cup
of
fragrant
coffee
smiling
down
in
the
general
direction
of
his
uplifted
face
without
meeting
his
eyes
there
was
certainly
nothing
lost
from
his
enjoyment
of
the
beverage
say
but
this
dinner
has
tasted
just
about
right
was
wayne
satisfied
observation
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
at
last
after
draining
his
third
cup
of
coffee
and
the
pot
itself
if
he
had
but
known
it
went
to
the
spot
asked
anthony
leaning
back
also
with
the
expression
of
the
friendly
host
he
was
young
to
cultivate
that
expression
but
he
appeared
to
find
no
difficulty
about
it
it
did
every
last
mouthful
good
now
if
you
fellows
will
come
back
to
the
fire
and
have
a
pipeful
of
talk
we
shall
not
be
missed
in
this
house
on
ordinary
occasions
we
reverse
the
order
of
privileges
the
men
retire
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
and
the
women
i
not
allowed
to
tell
what
they
do
but
after
remaining
discreetly
out
of
sight
for
some
little
time
during
which
faint
sounds
as
of
the
rattle
of
china
penetrate
through
closed
doors
they
reappear
pleasantly
flushed
and
full
of
a
sort
of
relieved
joy
i
know
what
i
wish
said
roger
barnes
looking
back
from
the
doorway
at
young
robeson
i
wish
that
when
the
dishes
are
all
ready
you
would
let
me
know
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
have
a
at
them
i
know
all
about
it
my
mother
taught
me
how
he
looked
so
precisely
as
if
he
meant
it
and
the
glance
he
sent
past
juliet
at
rachel
redding
was
so
suggestive
of
his
dislike
to
be
separated
for
the
coming
hour
from
the
feminine
portion
of
the
household
that
his
hostess
answered
promptly
of
course
you
may
we
never
refuse
an
offer
like
that
we
will
try
you
on
promise
of
good
behaviour
the
bachelor
begs
a
when
the
door
closed
on
the
three
juliet
produced
from
somewhere
two
aprons
attractive
affairs
on
the
pinafore
order
one
of
which
she
slipped
upon
rachel
the
other
donned
herself
these
are
my
kitchen
she
said
gayly
noting
how
the
pretty
garment
became
the
girl
calculated
to
impress
the
masculine
mind
with
the
charm
of
domesticity
in
women
the
doctor
needs
a
little
illustrated
lesson
of
the
sort
life
in
is
adapted
to
encourage
a
man
in
the
belief
that
real
comfort
is
to
be
found
anywhere
outside
of
a
bachelor
club
before
he
was
called
the
doctor
forsook
a
cigar
and
the
seductive
hollows
of
anthony
easiest
chair
and
marched
briskly
out
to
the
kitchen
you
see
i
distrust
you
he
announced
putting
in
his
head
at
the
door
i
afraid
you
will
get
them
all
done
without
me
not
a
bit
of
it
here
you
are
and
juliet
tied
a
big
white
apron
about
a
waist
here
your
towel
no
do
touch
the
glass
a
man
is
too
unconscious
of
his
strength
a
surgeon
demurred
rachel
softly
from
over
her
steaming
dishpan
thank
you
miss
redding
said
the
doctor
smiling
ah
how
stupid
of
me
juliet
made
amends
swiftly
miss
redding
remembers
that
when
i
got
my
telephone
message
i
told
her
that
the
most
distinguished
young
specialist
in
the
city
was
coming
here
to
dinner
a
hand
trained
to
such
delicate
tasks
as
those
of
surgery
here
roger
barnes
forgive
me
and
wipe
my
most
precious
goblets
you
have
my
nerves
unsteady
with
such
speeches
as
that
said
he
but
he
accepted
the
trust
he
held
the
goblets
and
the
other
daintily
cut
and
engraved
pieces
of
glass
with
evident
pleasure
in
the
task
meanwhile
juliet
and
rachel
made
rapid
work
of
the
greater
part
of
the
dishes
handling
thin
china
with
the
dexterity
of
housewives
who
love
their
work
and
their
china
talk
and
laughter
flowed
brightly
through
it
all
and
when
the
doctor
had
finished
his
glass
he
looked
disappointed
at
seeing
not
much
left
to
do
at
the
moment
rachel
was
scrubbing
and
scraping
a
big
portions
of
whose
surface
strongly
resisted
her
efforts
in
spite
of
previous
soaking
the
assistant
looking
about
him
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
fell
upon
this
dish
here
here
said
he
let
me
have
it
i
use
on
it
some
of
the
unconscious
strength
robeson
credits
me
with
but
rachel
clung
to
the
dish
proper
housekeepers
she
averred
always
say
all
thank
you
as
soon
as
the
china
is
done
and
finish
the
pots
and
kettles
after
the
guest
has
gone
back
to
pleasanter
things
i
see
did
you
ever
have
a
man
for
before
never
a
surgeon
admitted
miss
redding
then
you
do
appreciate
the
fact
that
a
man
likes
to
do
big
things
which
make
the
most
show
and
get
the
credit
for
them
he
took
the
dish
away
from
her
by
a
dexterous
little
twist
in
which
conscious
strength
certainly
asserted
itself
rachel
laughing
with
a
dash
of
colour
in
cheeks
which
were
normally
of
dark
ivory
tints
accepted
the
he
handed
her
hallo
there
cried
wayne
carey
voice
from
the
door
you
having
more
fun
out
here
than
we
are
in
there
and
that
not
fair
the
lord
of
the
manor
is
getting
so
chesty
over
the
delights
of
a
country
home
in
a
february
snowbank
that
he
becoming
heavy
company
no
room
for
you
here
returned
the
doctor
removing
with
a
flourish
the
last
candied
sugar
lump
from
the
bottom
of
the
big
dish
and
beginning
to
swash
about
vigorously
in
the
hot
water
we
do
something
besides
talk
out
here
we
work
our
kitchen
is
so
small
we
have
to
waste
no
time
in
steps
as
we
dry
the
things
we
chuck
them
straight
into
their
places
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
caught
up
a
shining
and
cast
it
straight
at
carey
that
gentleman
dodged
but
anthony
caught
it
performed
upon
it
an
imitation
of
the
cymbals
then
turned
about
and
laid
it
in
a
nest
of
similar
tins
upon
a
shelf
in
an
open
closet
ah
but
i
well
trained
he
boasted
if
you
were
you
would
put
it
away
wet
observed
rachel
slyly
anthony
withdrew
the
tin
wiped
it
with
much
solicitude
and
replaced
it
these
little
technicalities
are
beyond
me
he
apologised
your
real
athlete
in
kitchen
work
is
your
scientific
man
see
him
dry
that
with
the
now
i
know
better
than
that
go
away
all
of
you
commanded
the
mistress
of
the
place
go
back
to
the
fire
and
we
join
you
if
you
are
very
good
we
bring
you
a
special
treat
that
settles
it
said
the
doctor
and
led
the
retreat
but
not
without
a
backward
glance
at
the
little
kitchen
juliet
had
gone
into
the
with
a
trayful
of
glass
and
silver
rachel
redding
was
plunging
half
a
dozen
white
towels
into
a
pan
of
steaming
water
barnes
stood
an
instant
staring
hard
at
the
slender
figure
in
the
white
pinafore
the
round
young
arms
gleaming
in
the
lamplight
then
he
turned
to
follow
the
others
there
are
some
pictures
which
linger
long
in
a
man
memory
why
he
can
hardly
tell
with
all
his
varied
experiences
roger
barnes
had
never
before
discovered
how
attractive
a
background
a
kitchen
makes
for
a
beautiful
woman
so
that
she
be
there
mistress
of
the
situation
long
after
he
had
gone
back
to
the
fire
his
absent
eyes
while
the
others
talked
were
studying
the
to
him
unaccustomed
and
singularly
charming
scene
he
had
just
left
in
the
kitchen
when
juliet
and
rachel
came
in
at
length
they
found
a
plan
afoot
for
their
entertainment
wayne
carey
was
standing
at
the
window
showing
cause
why
the
whole
party
should
go
out
and
coast
upon
the
hill
near
by
you
admit
he
argued
with
anthony
that
you
know
where
we
can
get
a
pair
of
bobs
and
if
you
ca
i
bribe
some
of
those
youngsters
out
there
to
let
us
have
theirs
the
storm
has
stopped
the
boys
have
swept
off
the
whole
hill
i
should
judge
by
the
way
their
track
shines
again
under
the
moonlight
i
have
had
a
good
coast
since
i
left
college
he
turned
to
juliet
will
you
go
he
asked
coaxingly
of
course
we
will
promised
juliet
tony
wants
to
go
he
just
enjoying
making
you
tease
as
for
the
doctor
if
my
right
hand
has
not
forgot
her
cunning
he
agreed
in
ten
minutes
the
party
was
off
a
young
matron
of
five
months
standing
is
not
so
materially
changed
from
the
girl
she
used
to
be
that
she
can
fail
to
be
the
gayest
of
company
perhaps
with
the
more
zest
that
the
old
good
times
seem
a
bit
far
away
already
and
she
is
glad
to
bring
them
back
as
for
the
real
girl
of
the
party
in
this
case
it
chanced
to
be
a
country
lass
who
had
been
away
to
school
and
through
college
had
been
brought
home
by
love
and
duty
to
some
elderly
people
who
needed
her
and
had
known
many
hours
of
stifled
longing
for
the
sort
of
companionship
with
which
she
had
grown
happily
familiar
matron
and
maid
they
were
a
pair
for
whose
sakes
the
men
who
were
with
them
gladly
made
slaves
of
themselves
to
give
them
an
evening
of
glorious
outdoor
fun
and
at
small
sacrifice
what
a
night
exulted
the
doctor
striding
up
the
long
hill
beside
rachel
redding
breathing
deep
i
thanking
all
my
lucky
stars
that
they
led
my
path
across
anthony
robeson
i
been
intending
to
come
out
here
ever
since
he
was
married
and
might
not
have
done
it
for
another
six
months
if
i
had
got
started
he
have
all
he
wants
of
me
now
it
the
most
delightful
spot
i
been
in
for
many
moons
it
is
a
dear
little
home
agreed
rachel
warmly
robeson
would
make
the
most
commonplace
house
in
the
world
one
where
everybody
would
want
to
come
that
evident
yet
somehow
knowing
her
well
as
a
girl
i
never
should
have
suspected
just
those
qualities
you
did
know
her
then
i
suppose
she
was
a
girl
other
girls
liked
heartily
and
men
enthusiastically
one
of
the
be
a
good
friend
but
do
come
too
near
sort
you
know
but
she
was
very
fond
of
travel
and
change
ready
for
everything
in
the
way
of
sport
and
well
i
certainly
never
saw
her
before
in
anything
resembling
an
apron
of
any
description
what
a
delightful
article
of
attire
an
apron
is
anyhow
i
think
i
never
appreciated
it
before
that
because
you
never
saw
one
of
robeson
aprons
hers
are
not
like
other
people
she
makes
hers
poetic
does
she
she
certainly
does
even
the
ones
for
baking
and
sweeping
not
ruffled
or
beribboned
but
cut
with
an
eye
to
attractiveness
and
always
of
becoming
colour
i
see
she
an
artist
that
was
noticeable
in
the
oysters
if
she
made
the
dish
of
course
she
did
the
coffee
was
the
best
i
ever
drank
was
it
you
made
that
then
remarked
the
doctor
astutely
i
glad
it
was
good
said
rachel
demurely
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
doctor
barnes
insisted
that
anthony
had
been
the
best
steerer
of
coasting
parties
known
to
the
juvenile
world
and
placed
him
at
the
helm
next
came
juliet
with
both
arms
clasped
as
far
about
her
husband
stalwart
frame
as
they
would
go
carey
had
wanted
to
be
the
end
man
but
doctor
barnes
would
have
none
of
it
you
have
to
take
care
of
robeson
he
said
firmly
and
placed
him
next
this
brought
miss
redding
last
and
roger
barnes
knowing
man
as
behind
upon
bobs
already
fairly
full
the
last
man
as
every
coaster
understands
has
to
be
alert
to
help
out
any
possible
bad
steering
and
so
keeps
a
watchful
head
thrust
half
over
the
shoulder
in
front
the
foregoing
explanation
will
show
how
it
came
about
that
all
down
the
long
swift
descent
rachel
breathless
with
the
unaccustomed
delight
of
the
flight
felt
upon
her
cheek
a
warm
breath
and
was
conscious
of
a
most
extraordinary
nearness
of
the
lips
which
kept
saying
merry
things
into
her
ear
the
ear
itself
grew
warm
before
the
bottom
of
the
track
was
reached
that
was
a
great
coast
cried
the
doctor
as
they
reached
the
end
of
the
long
slide
now
for
another
i
a
boy
again
this
beats
the
best
thing
i
could
have
had
in
town
if
i
had
run
across
anthony
so
they
had
another
and
another
and
one
more
then
rachel
redding
stopping
in
front
of
a
small
house
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
said
to
them
and
slipped
away
before
barnes
had
realised
what
had
happened
does
she
live
there
he
questioned
juliet
as
the
four
who
were
left
moved
on
toward
home
anthony
and
wayne
were
discussing
a
subject
on
which
they
had
differed
at
the
top
of
the
hill
somehow
i
got
the
impression
she
lived
with
you
no
but
she
comes
over
a
good
deal
i
could
get
on
without
her
as
a
friend
juliet
looked
up
at
him
i
think
it
would
be
better
that
you
should
know
roger
she
said
and
i
sure
miss
redding
herself
would
prefer
it
that
i
pay
her
for
several
hours
a
day
of
regular
work
you
only
to
see
her
to
understand
that
she
does
this
simply
because
it
the
only
thing
open
to
her
as
long
as
her
father
and
mother
ca
spare
her
to
go
away
she
gave
up
her
college
course
in
the
middle
because
she
said
they
were
pining
to
death
for
her
they
are
in
very
greatly
reduced
circumstances
after
a
lifetime
of
prosperity
she
a
rare
creature
i
learning
to
appreciate
her
more
every
day
she
never
said
a
word
about
her
loneliness
here
but
it
shows
in
her
eyes
it
a
perfect
delight
to
me
to
have
her
with
me
and
i
mean
to
give
her
all
the
fun
i
can
for
all
that
demure
manner
and
her
madonna
face
she
as
full
of
mischief
as
a
kitten
when
something
starts
her
off
juliet
said
the
doctor
soberly
turning
to
look
searchingly
down
at
her
in
the
moonlight
would
you
be
willing
to
let
me
come
often
juliet
looked
up
quickly
so
that
you
may
see
her
she
asked
straightforwardly
yes
i
wo
pretend
it
anything
else
i
can
tell
you
honestly
that
if
there
were
no
other
reason
i
should
want
to
come
because
of
my
old
friendship
for
you
and
anthony
and
because
this
evening
in
your
little
home
has
given
me
a
rare
pleasure
i
know
of
no
place
like
it
but
tell
you
squarely
that
i
want
the
chance
to
meet
your
friend
often
and
at
once
if
i
do
you
will
have
other
people
coming
out
from
town
yes
said
juliet
and
something
in
the
way
she
said
it
made
him
ask
quickly
has
that
already
happened
am
i
too
late
i
do
know
whether
you
too
late
but
i
know
that
we
suddenly
grown
most
attractive
to
another
man
from
town
if
you
had
gone
into
rachel
home
the
odour
of
violets
would
have
met
you
at
the
door
he
sends
them
every
few
days
said
the
doctor
it
was
not
much
of
a
comment
but
it
spoke
volumes
he
had
been
keen
before
he
was
determined
now
violets
well
there
were
rarer
flowers
than
those
smoke
and
talk
at
the
house
there
remained
for
the
guests
an
hour
before
the
fire
where
juliet
brought
in
something
hot
and
sweet
and
sour
and
spicy
which
tasted
delicious
and
brought
her
a
shower
of
compliments
while
they
drank
a
friendly
draught
to
her
when
she
had
left
them
standing
in
an
admiring
group
on
the
and
wishing
her
happy
dreams
they
settled
into
luxurious
positions
of
ease
before
the
fire
a
fire
in
the
last
stages
of
red
comfort
before
it
dies
into
a
smoulder
of
torrid
ashes
anthony
robeson
said
wayne
carey
regarding
the
andirons
fixedly
over
his
pipe
you
a
happy
man
anthony
laughed
contentedly
he
had
thrown
himself
down
upon
the
with
his
head
on
a
pillow
pulled
from
the
settle
and
lay
flat
on
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
neck
it
was
an
attitude
deeply
expressive
of
masculine
comfort
you
exactly
right
said
he
and
you
would
be
the
same
if
you
would
give
up
living
in
that
infernal
what
do
you
want
to
fool
with
your
first
year
of
married
life
like
that
for
you
told
me
that
judith
was
bowled
over
by
our
wedding
and
was
ready
to
go
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
with
a
will
i
know
it
admitted
carey
but
he
spoke
hesitatingly
we
seem
to
find
this
sort
of
thing
you
had
corralled
all
there
was
nonsense
you
had
everything
we
looked
at
was
so
old
and
mouldy
or
so
new
and
inartistic
or
so
or
so
far
away
well
we
could
seem
to
get
at
it
so
we
said
we
board
a
while
and
wait
until
we
could
look
around
how
does
it
work
why
i
suppose
it
works
very
well
said
carey
cautiously
judith
seems
contented
we
have
as
good
meals
as
the
average
in
such
houses
and
the
people
are
rather
a
nice
lot
we
invited
around
quite
a
good
deal
and
judith
likes
that
i
ought
to
like
it
better
than
i
do
somehow
i
so
confoundedly
tired
when
i
get
home
nights
i
ca
help
thinking
of
you
and
juliet
here
in
this
jolly
room
there
an
abominable
blue
and
yellow
on
our
and
it
has
a
way
of
appearing
to
turn
seasick
in
the
evening
under
the
electrics
sometimes
i
think
it
that
that
makes
me
feel
seasick
too
inquired
the
doctor
with
his
professional
air
he
was
standing
with
his
arm
on
the
looking
alternately
down
on
his
friends
and
around
the
long
low
room
it
a
jolly
room
the
very
essence
of
comfort
and
cosiness
it
was
a
beautiful
room
too
in
a
simple
way
one
which
satisfied
his
sense
of
harmony
in
colours
and
fabrics
a
keen
sense
with
him
as
it
is
apt
to
be
with
men
of
his
profession
judith
likes
this
too
you
know
carey
went
on
loyally
she
thinks
it
great
but
how
to
get
it
for
ourselves
that
another
matter
somehow
you
were
lucky
did
you
ever
happen
to
see
asked
anthony
a
photograph
i
took
just
for
fun
of
this
house
as
it
was
when
juliet
saw
it
first
no
well
just
look
in
that
box
on
the
end
of
the
farther
bookcase
will
you
it
near
the
top
there
that
it
he
lay
looking
up
through
lashes
at
the
two
men
as
they
studied
the
photograph
the
doctor
leaning
over
carey
shoulder
on
your
word
man
did
it
look
like
that
cried
barnes
just
like
that
yes
i
heard
it
did
admitted
carey
but
i
never
quite
believed
it
could
have
been
as
bad
as
that
who
planned
it
all
the
doctor
asked
getting
possession
of
the
photograph
as
carey
laid
it
down
and
giving
it
careful
scrutiny
my
little
jove
are
there
any
more
like
her
they
pretty
rare
i
understand
juliet
has
one
in
training
one
with
a
good
deal
of
native
capacity
i
should
judge
let
me
know
when
her
graduation
day
approaches
remarked
the
doctor
when
he
fell
asleep
that
night
in
the
dainty
barnes
was
wondering
whether
robeson
got
her
own
breakfasts
and
hoping
that
she
certainly
did
not
at
least
when
guests
were
in
the
house
he
was
down
half
an
hour
earlier
than
necessary
and
to
his
great
satisfaction
found
a
slender
figure
brushing
up
ashes
and
setting
the
fireplace
in
order
for
the
morning
fire
as
he
begged
leave
to
help
he
noted
the
satin
smoothness
of
miss
redding
heavy
black
hair
and
the
trim
perfection
of
her
attire
she
reminded
him
of
his
hospital
nurses
in
their
immaculate
blue
and
white
when
he
saw
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
found
her
similarly
dressed
a
certain
skepticism
grew
in
his
mind
when
he
went
out
to
breakfast
he
murmured
in
anthony
ear
just
tell
me
old
fellow
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
a
bachelor
do
these
girls
of
your
household
always
look
like
this
in
the
early
morning
i
know
mean
but
you
will
know
how
to
evade
me
if
i
too
impertinent
anthony
glanced
from
juliet
resembling
a
pink
carnation
in
her
wash
frock
february
though
it
was
to
rachel
redding
in
dark
blue
and
white
and
smiled
mischievously
robeson
and
miss
redding
you
are
challenged
he
announced
here
a
fine
old
chump
who
has
an
awful
suspicion
that
maybe
when
there
are
no
guests
you
come
down
in
calico
wrappers
with
aprons
on
juliet
gave
the
doctor
a
glance
which
made
him
pretend
to
shrink
behind
carey
for
protection
will
you
please
answer
him
tony
she
said
on
my
word
and
honour
roger
barnes
then
said
anthony
proudly
they
always
look
like
this
when
the
doctor
left
he
was
weighing
carefully
in
his
mind
an
urgent
problem
after
waiting
six
months
before
making
his
first
visit
at
the
robesons
how
soon
could
he
decently
come
again
strawberries
here
are
yer
strawberries
ma
juliet
alone
in
her
little
kitchen
ran
to
the
door
in
dismay
she
looked
down
at
a
boy
carrying
a
big
basket
filled
with
but
my
order
was
for
next
wednesday
she
said
well
pa
said
he
you
ruther
have
when
they
was
at
the
best
an
that
now
this
hot
weather
a
dryin
up
may
not
be
any
good
ones
by
wednesday
every
housekeeper
knows
that
if
there
is
one
thing
particularly
liable
to
happen
it
is
the
arrival
of
fruit
for
preserving
at
the
most
inopportune
moment
of
the
week
it
matters
little
what
the
excuse
of
the
sender
may
be
there
is
always
a
sufficient
reason
why
the
original
date
set
by
the
buyer
has
been
ignored
in
this
case
the
strawberries
had
been
engaged
from
a
neighbour
and
juliet
understood
at
once
that
she
must
not
refuse
to
take
them
she
stood
looking
at
the
rows
of
baskets
upon
the
table
when
the
boy
had
placed
them
there
and
gone
whistling
away
she
was
in
the
midst
of
a
flurry
of
work
it
was
saturday
and
she
was
cooking
and
baking
putting
together
various
dishes
to
be
used
upon
the
morrow
horatio
marcy
had
lately
returned
from
abroad
he
and
dingley
were
to
spend
the
coming
sabbath
with
juliet
and
anthony
the
first
occasion
on
which
father
should
be
entertained
in
the
house
it
was
an
event
of
importance
and
his
daughter
meant
to
show
him
several
things
concerning
her
fitness
for
her
present
position
rachel
redding
was
not
available
upon
this
saturday
morning
her
mother
had
been
taken
seriously
ill
the
night
before
and
rachel
had
sent
word
that
she
could
not
leave
her
juliet
had
not
minded
much
although
it
was
a
day
when
rachel
help
would
have
been
especially
acceptable
as
it
was
she
had
reached
a
point
where
her
housewifely
marshalling
of
the
work
was
at
a
critical
stage
a
cake
had
been
put
into
the
oven
a
large
bowl
of
soup
stock
had
been
brought
from
a
cool
retreat
to
have
the
smooth
coating
of
fat
removed
from
its
surface
various
other
dishes
in
process
of
construction
awaited
the
skilled
touch
of
the
cook
i
shall
have
to
do
them
i
suppose
said
robeson
to
herself
regarding
the
strawberries
with
a
disapproving
eye
but
they
had
to
come
she
went
at
the
strawberries
wishing
she
had
ordered
less
they
were
fine
berries
on
top
by
degrees
as
the
boxes
lowered
they
became
less
fine
it
seemed
desirable
to
separate
the
superior
from
the
inferior
and
treat
them
differently
only
the
best
would
do
for
the
delectable
preserve
which
was
to
go
into
glasses
and
be
served
on
special
occasions
the
others
could
be
made
into
jam
less
attractive
to
the
eye
if
hardly
less
acceptable
to
the
palate
juliet
was
obliged
to
put
down
her
every
fifth
minute
to
attend
to
one
or
other
of
the
various
saucepans
and
upon
the
little
range
her
cheeks
grew
flushed
for
the
day
was
hot
and
the
kitchen
hotter
it
must
be
admitted
that
her
occasional
glance
out
over
the
green
fields
and
the
woods
beyond
was
a
longing
one
the
better
selection
of
the
berries
went
into
the
clear
syrup
in
the
juliet
flew
to
get
her
glass
pots
ready
she
stopped
to
stir
something
in
a
saucepan
she
thrust
some
eggs
into
the
small
to
cool
them
for
the
salad
dressing
soon
to
be
made
she
kept
one
eye
on
the
clock
for
the
strawberry
preserve
had
to
be
timed
to
a
minute
ten
no
more
no
less
it
was
a
strenuous
hour
as
she
dipped
up
the
fourth
ladleful
of
crimson
richness
translucent
as
a
church
window
and
filled
the
waiting
jar
a
peculiar
pungent
odour
drifted
across
the
fragrance
of
the
strawberries
juliet
dropped
her
ladle
and
pulled
open
the
oven
door
the
delicate
cake
which
she
had
compounded
with
especial
care
because
it
was
dingley
favourite
lay
a
blackened
ruin
some
of
it
had
run
over
upon
the
oven
bottom
and
become
a
mass
of
cinders
juliet
jerked
the
out
into
the
daylight
and
shut
the
oven
door
with
a
slam
it
was
at
this
unpropitious
moment
that
a
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
a
tall
slim
figure
in
crisp
cool
white
linen
a
charming
white
hat
surmounted
wayne
carey
carefully
ordered
hair
a
white
parasol
in
her
hands
completed
a
particularly
chaste
and
appropriate
morning
toilette
for
a
young
woman
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
kitchens
she
was
regarding
with
interest
the
young
person
at
the
range
juliet
wore
one
of
her
characteristic
working
frocks
and
the
big
pinafore
which
enveloped
it
from
head
to
foot
was
of
an
attractive
design
but
the
morning
flurry
had
set
its
signs
upon
her
and
the
pinafore
was
not
as
immaculate
as
it
had
been
three
hours
earlier
her
hair
curling
moistly
about
her
flushed
face
had
been
impatiently
pushed
back
more
than
once
and
its
disorder
while
not
unpicturesque
was
suggestive
of
a
somewhat
perturbed
mind
her
hands
were
pink
with
strawberry
juice
she
looked
warm
tired
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
at
the
moment
not
a
little
out
of
temper
the
smile
with
which
she
welcomed
her
friend
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
one
of
absolute
pleasure
i
afraid
i
come
at
the
wrong
time
said
judith
regretfully
did
you
just
burn
something
too
bad
i
suppose
all
young
housekeepers
do
that
where
your
assistant
she
not
here
said
juliet
ladling
up
strawberry
preserve
with
more
haste
than
caution
her
fingers
shook
a
little
but
she
kept
her
voice
tranquil
it
all
right
a
number
of
things
had
to
be
done
at
once
that
all
please
do
stay
in
this
hot
place
take
off
your
hat
and
find
a
cool
corner
somewhere
in
the
house
i
be
in
presently
i
must
bother
you
i
was
going
to
stay
for
lunch
with
you
it
was
so
hot
in
town
but
i
must
think
of
it
when
you
so
of
course
you
stay
said
juliet
with
decision
what
you
see
before
you
is
only
the
smoke
of
battle
it
will
soon
clear
away
run
off
and
i
be
with
you
presently
you
find
the
late
magazines
in
the
her
tone
was
intended
to
deceive
and
it
was
sufficiently
successful
judith
was
anxious
to
stay
she
was
also
interested
in
the
situation
she
had
heard
much
from
wayne
in
praise
of
juliet
successful
housekeeping
and
had
seen
enough
of
it
herself
to
be
curious
about
its
inner
workings
for
the
first
time
she
had
happened
upon
a
scene
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
there
were
phases
in
this
sort
of
domestic
life
less
ideal
than
she
was
asked
to
believe
she
went
back
into
the
coolness
and
quiet
of
the
with
a
full
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
no
hot
kitchens
ever
threatened
her
own
peace
of
mind
juliet
finished
her
strawberry
preserve
saw
that
everything
liable
to
burn
was
removed
to
safe
quarters
then
deliberately
took
off
her
apron
and
stole
out
of
the
kitchen
door
she
went
swiftly
down
through
the
orchard
to
the
path
by
the
brook
then
out
of
sight
of
everything
human
ran
several
rods
down
it
with
a
sweep
of
skirts
which
put
everything
in
the
bird
creation
to
flight
at
a
certain
pleasant
spot
among
the
willows
sheltered
from
all
possible
observation
she
paused
and
flung
herself
down
upon
the
warm
ground
but
not
in
any
attitude
of
despair
neither
did
she
cry
tears
of
vexation
and
weariness
she
was
a
healthy
girl
with
the
perfect
physical
being
whose
poise
is
not
upset
by
so
small
a
matter
as
a
fatiguing
morning
because
a
cake
had
burned
an
extra
amount
of
work
had
had
to
be
conquered
and
an
unexpected
guest
had
arrived
her
nerves
were
not
worn
to
the
rending
point
but
having
been
reared
in
the
belief
that
a
breath
of
outdoors
is
the
great
antidote
for
all
physical
or
mental
discomforts
born
of
confinement
indoors
she
had
acquired
a
habit
of
running
away
from
her
cares
at
any
and
all
times
of
day
in
precisely
this
fashion
and
many
were
the
advantages
she
had
reaped
from
this
somewhat
unusual
course
of
procedure
anthony
robeson
lay
upon
one
side
her
arm
outstretched
her
cheek
pillowed
upon
her
arm
she
was
drawing
long
deep
breaths
and
looking
lazily
off
at
a
stretch
of
blue
sky
cleft
in
the
exact
centre
by
one
great
graceful
elm
tree
one
would
have
thought
she
had
forgotten
every
care
in
the
world
not
to
mention
the
guest
from
the
city
waiting
expectantly
for
her
hostess
to
appear
after
ten
minutes
of
this
sort
of
indolence
the
figure
in
the
blue
and
white
print
dress
sat
up
clasped
both
arms
about
her
knees
and
remained
regarding
with
half
closed
eyes
the
softly
fluttering
leaves
of
the
willows
along
the
edge
of
the
brook
the
hot
flush
died
out
of
her
cheeks
the
lips
whose
expression
a
few
minutes
since
had
indicated
under
a
combination
of
trying
circumstances
relaxed
into
their
natural
sweetness
with
a
tendency
toward
mirth
and
her
whole
aspect
became
that
merely
of
the
young
athlete
resting
from
one
encounter
and
preparing
herself
for
another
at
length
she
rose
shook
out
her
skirts
and
said
aloud
now
judith
dearborn
carey
i
ready
to
upset
your
expectations
since
you
looked
in
at
me
this
morning
you
been
thinking
i
wished
i
had
have
you
well
you
may
just
understand
that
i
do
wish
anything
of
the
sort
and
in
five
minutes
more
she
had
walked
in
upon
her
guest
by
way
of
the
front
door
her
pretty
face
serene
her
hands
full
of
pink
june
roses
which
she
threw
in
a
fragrant
mass
of
beauty
into
her
friend
lap
put
those
into
bowls
for
me
will
you
she
requested
arrange
them
to
suit
yourself
are
they
lovely
i
suppose
you
getting
hungry
in
half
an
hour
you
shall
be
served
with
a
very
modest
but
i
trust
not
insufficient
lunch
would
you
like
hot
chocolate
or
iced
tea
iced
tea
by
all
means
chose
judith
who
being
used
to
the
privileges
of
selection
from
a
variety
of
offered
foods
and
beverages
was
apt
to
want
what
was
not
set
before
her
when
at
a
private
table
juliet
understood
this
propensity
of
her
friend
and
slyly
took
advantage
of
it
as
it
happened
she
knew
that
at
the
moment
she
was
quite
out
of
chocolate
but
she
had
counted
advisedly
upon
judith
choice
on
a
hot
june
day
and
she
smiled
to
herself
as
she
chopped
ice
and
sliced
lemon
at
the
end
of
the
half
hour
judith
who
found
the
coolness
of
the
too
delightful
to
allow
her
to
keep
watch
of
her
friend
in
the
hot
kitchen
much
as
she
was
tempted
to
do
so
was
summoned
to
an
equally
cool
upon
the
bare
table
daintily
set
out
upon
some
of
the
embroidered
white
doilies
of
juliet
wedding
linen
was
a
simple
lunch
of
a
character
which
appealed
to
the
guest
critical
appetite
in
a
way
which
made
her
draw
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
you
certainly
do
have
a
trick
of
serving
things
to
make
them
taste
better
than
other
people
she
acknowledged
glancing
from
the
little
platter
of
broiled
chicken
with
its
bit
of
parsley
to
the
crisp
fruit
salad
made
up
of
she
knew
not
what
but
presenting
an
appetising
appearance
then
regarding
fondly
a
dish
of
spinach
pleasingly
flanked
by
thin
slices
of
boiled
egg
it
really
too
hot
to
eat
anything
very
solid
agreed
juliet
with
guile
rachel
and
i
have
a
way
of
planning
our
lunches
a
day
or
two
ahead
so
that
the
leftovers
we
use
up
are
not
yesterday
but
the
day
before
and
we
remember
with
surprise
how
good
the
original
dish
was
far
back
in
the
past
i
wish
anthony
could
have
his
midday
meal
at
home
though
perhaps
if
he
did
the
dinners
would
strike
him
so
happily
do
you
think
it
great
fun
to
see
a
big
hearty
man
sit
down
at
a
table
and
look
at
it
with
an
expression
of
adoration
women
may
deride
the
fact
as
they
will
but
a
healthy
body
does
demand
good
things
to
eat
and
should
be
blamed
for
liking
them
wayne
has
much
appetite
said
judith
eating
away
with
relish
he
dislikes
the
people
at
our
table
sometimes
i
think
that
why
he
bolts
his
food
and
gets
off
in
such
a
hurry
by
the
way
juliet
are
you
and
tony
coming
in
to
the
reardons
of
course
you
are
i
suppose
we
must
admitted
juliet
with
reluctance
we
have
refused
a
good
many
things
since
we
been
here
but
i
did
promise
reardon
we
would
try
to
come
the
little
repast
over
judith
offered
with
well
simulated
warmth
to
help
her
friend
with
the
after
work
but
juliet
would
have
none
of
her
she
sent
her
guest
out
into
a
hammock
under
the
trees
and
despatched
the
business
of
putting
the
little
kitchen
to
rights
with
the
celerity
of
one
who
means
to
have
done
with
it
in
the
middle
of
the
june
afternoon
judith
awoke
from
a
nap
in
the
hammock
to
find
her
hostess
standing
laughing
beside
her
fresh
in
a
thin
gown
of
flowered
dimity
well
yawned
judith
heavily
i
must
have
gone
off
to
sleep
i
was
tired
i
am
tireder
this
is
a
fatiguing
sort
of
weather
do
you
think
so
but
you
do
look
it
and
after
all
that
work
i
found
you
in
why
are
you
used
up
it
me
to
do
things
in
the
heat
juliet
dropped
a
big
blue
denim
pillow
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
upon
it
in
a
flutter
of
dimity
she
lifted
a
smiling
face
and
said
with
spirit
last
summer
i
could
walk
miles
over
a
golf
course
twice
a
day
and
not
mind
it
in
the
least
the
year
before
i
was
most
of
the
time
on
the
river
rowing
till
i
was
as
strong
as
a
girl
could
be
i
had
gymnasium
work
and
fencing
lessons
and
have
been
brought
up
to
keep
myself
in
perfect
trim
by
my
baths
and
exercise
what
frail
thing
am
i
that
a
little
housework
should
use
me
up
yes
i
know
you
always
did
go
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
reflected
judith
eyeing
her
companion
fresh
colour
and
bright
eyes
i
suppose
i
ought
but
i
never
cared
for
it
i
do
mean
the
baths
and
all
that
of
course
any
woman
adores
warm
baths
i
do
like
the
cold
plunges
and
showers
you
always
add
on
then
do
expect
the
results
it
is
everybody
who
has
your
energetic
temperament
i
hate
golf
despise
tennis
never
rowed
a
stroke
in
my
life
and
could
no
more
keep
house
as
you
are
doing
than
i
could
fly
let
me
see
said
juliet
demurely
pretending
to
consider
what
is
it
that
you
do
like
to
do
you
know
well
enough
and
little
enough
of
it
i
can
get
now
with
a
husband
who
never
cares
to
stir
there
was
a
suspicion
of
bitterness
in
judith
voice
but
juliet
ignoring
it
went
blithely
on
i
a
strong
conviction
that
one
ca
be
happy
without
being
busy
now
that
i
ca
keep
up
my
athletic
sports
i
should
become
a
pale
hypochondriac
without
these
housewifely
affairs
to
employ
me
i
do
like
to
embroider
i
ca
paint
china
i
not
a
musician
i
somehow
care
to
begin
to
devote
myself
to
clubs
in
town
i
love
my
books
and
the
great
outdoors
and
plenty
of
action
you
a
strange
girl
was
judith
verdict
getting
languidly
out
of
the
hammock
an
hour
later
after
an
animated
discussion
with
her
friend
on
various
matters
touching
on
the
lives
of
both
either
you
a
remarkable
actress
or
you
as
contented
as
you
seem
to
be
i
wish
i
had
your
enthusiasm
everything
bores
me
look
at
this
frock
after
lying
in
a
hammock
is
white
linen
the
prettiest
thing
when
you
put
it
on
and
the
most
used
up
when
you
take
it
off
of
any
fabric
known
to
the
shops
it
is
indeed
but
if
anybody
can
afford
to
wear
it
it
you
who
never
sit
recklessly
about
on
banks
and
fences
but
keep
cool
and
correct
and
stately
and
discontented
i
admit
i
talked
like
a
fractious
child
all
day
but
i
had
a
good
time
and
want
to
come
oftener
than
i
have
may
i
of
course
you
may
must
you
go
i
keep
you
to
dinner
and
send
for
wayne
you
an
angel
but
i
an
engagement
for
five
and
there
the
reardons
this
evening
you
wo
forget
that
you
and
anthony
will
be
sure
to
come
i
not
promise
absolutely
but
i
see
reardon
was
so
kind
as
to
leave
it
open
it
an
informal
affair
i
believe
informal
but
very
gorgeous
just
the
same
she
would
give
anybody
but
you
such
an
elastic
invitation
as
that
and
you
should
appreciate
her
eagerness
to
get
you
declared
judith
who
cared
very
much
from
whom
her
invitations
came
and
could
never
understand
her
friend
careless
attitude
toward
the
most
impressive
of
them
juliet
watched
her
guest
go
down
the
street
and
waved
an
affectionate
hand
at
her
as
judith
looked
back
from
her
seat
in
the
trolley
car
poor
old
judy
she
said
to
herself
how
glad
you
are
you
not
i
and
how
very
very
glad
i
am
i
not
you
an
observation
it
must
be
admitted
essentially
feminine
no
man
is
ever
heard
to
felicitate
himself
upon
the
fact
that
he
is
not
some
other
man
anthony
plays
maid
after
dinner
that
night
juliet
having
once
more
put
things
in
order
and
slipped
off
the
big
pinafore
which
had
kept
her
spotless
joined
her
husband
in
the
garden
up
and
down
which
he
was
comfortably
pacing
hands
in
pockets
pipe
in
mouth
jolly
spot
is
it
come
and
perambulate
he
suggested
just
for
a
minute
tony
are
we
going
to
the
reardons
he
stood
still
and
considered
i
do
know
are
we
did
you
accept
on
condition
that
you
felt
like
it
i
represented
you
as
coming
home
decidedly
fagged
these
hot
nights
and
not
always
caring
to
stir
wise
schemer
i
do
mind
the
aspersion
on
my
physical
being
she
urged
i
suppose
she
did
i
do
know
why
i
do
anthony
smiled
down
at
his
wife
everybody
is
a
bit
curious
about
us
these
days
your
position
you
see
is
considered
very
extraordinary
nonsense
tony
shall
we
go
possibly
we
better
though
it
racks
my
soul
to
think
of
dressing
the
less
i
wear
my
festive
garments
the
less
i
want
to
for
that
very
reason
suppose
we
discipline
ourselves
and
go
do
you
mind
not
at
all
we
have
to
dress
at
once
for
it
nearly
eight
now
and
by
the
time
we
have
caught
a
train
and
got
to
hollyhurst
to
be
sure
here
goes
then
half
an
hour
later
anthony
wrestling
with
a
refractory
cuff
button
looked
up
to
see
his
wife
at
his
elbow
she
was
very
nearly
a
vision
of
elegance
and
beauty
the
lacking
essential
was
explained
to
him
by
a
voice
very
much
out
of
breath
and
a
trifle
petulant
if
you
care
anything
for
me
tony
stop
everything
and
hook
me
up
all
mixed
up
and
i
ca
reach
and
i
sure
i
torn
that
little
lace
frill
at
the
back
all
right
where
do
i
begin
under
my
left
arm
i
think
i
ca
possibly
see
neither
can
i
he
was
poking
about
under
the
lifted
arm
among
folds
of
filmy
stuff
here
we
are
no
we
are
does
this
top
hook
go
in
this
little
pocket
on
the
other
side
i
suppose
so
ca
you
tell
whether
it
does
by
the
look
it
seems
a
bit
blind
to
me
murmured
anthony
struggling
it
meant
to
be
blind
it
must
show
when
it
fastened
it
certainly
does
now
hold
on
do
wriggle
i
got
it
now
found
the
combination
three
turns
to
the
right
five
to
the
left
clear
around
once
then
hullo
i
come
out
wrong
the
thing
does
track
at
the
bottom
you
missed
a
hook
oh
no
i
hung
onto
all
the
way
down
then
you
missed
an
eye
you
have
to
unhook
it
all
and
begin
again
anthony
obeyed
i
glad
i
do
have
to
get
into
my
clothes
around
the
corner
this
way
he
commented
here
you
are
we
stuck
to
the
schedule
this
time
wait
dear
you
have
fastened
the
shoulder
there
are
ever
so
many
little
hooks
along
there
and
around
the
arm
hole
i
should
say
there
were
what
the
good
of
so
many
where
do
they
begin
look
out
wait
a
minute
juliet
if
you
do
stop
twisting
around
so
i
never
can
do
it
i
can
do
great
heroic
acts
it
the
little
trials
that
floor
me
there
no
that
does
look
right
juliet
ran
to
the
mirror
it
is
right
she
cried
look
that
corner
should
lap
over
like
that
oh
if
i
could
only
reach
myself
you
ca
i
often
tried
it
the
human
anatomy
stand
still
julie
you
getting
nervous
if
there
one
thing
that
trying
murmured
juliet
why
do
you
let
your
dressmakers
build
your
frocks
this
way
why
not
get
into
all
in
front
where
you
can
see
what
you
doing
now
i
got
it
is
that
right
yes
wait
tony
here
the
girdle
it
fastens
behind
anthony
surveyed
the
incomprehensible
affair
of
silk
and
velvet
ribbon
she
put
into
his
hands
looks
like
a
to
me
he
said
juliet
laughed
and
fitted
it
about
her
own
waist
anthony
attempted
to
make
it
join
at
the
back
of
the
points
she
held
out
to
him
it
wo
come
together
he
said
oh
yes
it
will
draw
it
tight
i
am
drawing
it
tight
it
smaller
than
you
are
you
ca
wear
it
juliet
laughed
again
anthony
tugged
wait
till
i
hold
my
breath
she
said
guns
he
ejaculated
and
by
the
exertion
of
much
force
fastened
the
girdle
then
he
stood
off
a
step
or
two
and
looked
at
his
wife
curiously
flushed
and
laughing
she
returned
his
gaze
can
you
breathe
he
asked
solicitously
of
course
i
can
what
with
it
is
a
little
tight
of
course
she
admitted
this
is
one
of
my
trousseau
dresses
i
grown
a
little
stouter
i
suppose
never
mind
i
can
stand
it
for
thank
you
very
much
you
must
hurry
now
tony
i
have
had
my
pay
for
playing
maid
he
said
and
came
close
he
surveyed
his
wife
fair
neck
and
shoulders
turned
her
around
and
deliberately
kissed
the
soft
hollow
where
the
firm
white
flesh
of
her
neck
met
the
waving
brown
hair
drawn
lightly
upwards
that
the
spot
that
tantalized
me
for
about
six
years
he
observed
hunting
hurriedly
through
various
drawers
and
boxes
in
the
room
in
search
of
gloves
and
fan
juliet
heard
her
husband
come
in
his
turn
to
her
open
door
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
look
at
me
he
requested
in
a
melancholy
voice
juliet
turned
gave
him
one
glance
and
broke
into
a
merry
peal
oh
tony
what
the
matter
have
you
been
growing
stouter
too
it
must
be
he
said
solemnly
his
clawhammer
coat
was
so
tight
across
the
shoulders
that
the
strain
was
evident
he
was
holding
his
arms
in
the
exaggerated
position
of
the
small
boy
who
wears
a
last
year
suit
juliet
revolved
around
her
well
built
figure
with
interest
it
does
look
tight
she
said
but
have
you
grown
heavier
all
at
once
it
ca
be
long
since
you
wore
that
coat
before
do
believe
i
have
for
months
it
been
altogether
and
informals
i
have
been
to
an
evening
affair
with
ladies
for
a
good
while
it
does
look
as
it
feels
i
sure
it
getting
very
late
we
ought
to
be
off
and
juliet
gathered
up
her
belongings
and
gave
him
a
long
loose
coat
to
hold
for
her
which
covered
her
finery
completely
now
the
hour
when
i
regret
that
i
have
a
carriage
for
you
said
anthony
as
they
descended
the
stairs
he
got
into
his
outer
coat
reluctantly
i
shall
split
something
around
my
back
before
the
evening
is
over
he
prophesied
resignedly
never
mind
remember
how
tight
my
girdle
is
it
grows
tighter
every
minute
they
got
out
upon
the
porch
and
anthony
locked
the
door
if
i
should
show
that
to
any
man
i
know
except
carey
he
would
howl
he
remarked
holding
up
the
queer
old
brass
affair
before
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
he
looked
down
at
juliet
in
the
gathering
june
twilight
you
wish
we
did
have
to
go
yes
i
do
she
agreed
frankly
let
not
my
dear
boy
at
this
hour
we
could
telephone
should
you
feel
rather
ashamed
to
so
late
not
a
bit
but
of
course
we
go
if
you
say
so
she
laughed
and
he
joined
her
boyishly
she
hesitated
if
i
see
you
looking
faint
in
that
girdle
shall
i
throw
a
glass
of
cold
water
over
you
please
do
if
i
hear
a
sound
as
of
rending
cloth
shall
i
divert
the
attention
of
the
company
by
all
means
they
were
laughing
like
two
children
anthony
sat
down
in
one
of
the
porch
chairs
he
drew
a
long
sigh
i
never
hated
to
leave
my
dear
home
so
since
i
came
into
it
he
said
gloomily
juliet
pulled
off
her
coat
if
you
do
the
telephoning
i
stay
she
said
he
jumped
to
his
feet
let
me
loosen
that
girdle
for
you
i
have
been
breathing
below
the
fifth
rib
myself
since
you
put
it
on
just
in
sympathy
he
declared
a
outdoors
the
trouble
is
said
anthony
robeson
shifting
his
position
on
the
step
below
juliet
so
that
he
could
rest
his
head
against
her
knee
the
trouble
is
we
getting
too
popular
juliet
laughed
and
ran
her
fingers
through
his
thick
locks
gently
tweaking
them
the
two
were
alone
together
in
the
warm
darkness
of
a
july
evening
upon
their
own
little
porch
it
the
first
evening
we
had
to
ourselves
since
the
big
snowdrift
under
the
front
windows
melted
that
was
about
the
date
roger
barnes
met
louis
lockwood
here
the
first
time
ye
gods
but
they
kept
each
footprints
warm
since
then
have
they
and
now
cathcart
is
giving
indications
of
having
contracted
the
fatal
malady
ca
rachel
redding
be
incarcerated
somewhere
until
the
next
moon
is
past
i
notice
they
all
have
worse
symptoms
each
third
quarter
that
girl
looks
innocent
but
by
heaven
julie
i
think
she
has
it
down
fine
no
you
do
said
juliet
persuasively
i
should
catch
her
at
it
if
she
were
deliberately
trying
to
keep
two
such
men
as
roger
and
louis
pitted
against
each
other
they
doing
it
all
themselves
i
known
her
to
run
away
when
she
saw
one
of
them
coming
so
that
she
could
be
found
but
tony
dear
i
a
plan
good
i
hope
it
a
duel
between
the
two
principals
if
it
is
i
going
to
tamper
with
the
weapons
and
see
that
each
injures
himself
past
help
i
getting
a
little
weary
of
playing
the
hospitable
host
to
a
trio
of
listen
we
entertain
them
all
at
once
for
a
week
with
some
extra
girls
and
judith
and
wayne
and
then
we
announce
that
we
not
at
home
for
a
month
all
at
once
a
anthony
sat
up
and
laughed
uproariously
i
tremendous
faith
in
you
love
but
where
in
the
name
of
all
the
french
sardines
that
ever
were
dovetailed
would
you
put
such
a
crowd
i
a
practical
plan
louis
lockwood
belongs
to
a
fishing
club
that
spends
every
august
up
in
canada
they
have
a
big
tent
twenty
by
for
he
told
me
so
the
other
day
he
would
get
it
for
us
we
would
put
it
out
in
the
orchard
close
to
the
river
you
and
wayne
and
roger
and
louis
and
stevens
cathcart
could
sleep
down
there
and
i
could
easily
take
care
of
judith
and
suzanne
gerard
and
marie
dresser
here
in
the
house
rachel
should
stay
here
too
and
auntie
dingley
would
send
down
mary
mckaim
to
cook
for
us
i
sure
that
not
so
bad
but
why
rachel
when
you
have
so
little
room
because
i
want
her
to
have
all
the
fun
because
if
i
do
keep
her
here
she
will
be
running
away
half
the
time
and
because
now
comes
the
real
reason
observed
anthony
sagely
i
do
want
the
other
girls
thinking
she
has
the
unfair
advantage
of
taking
a
man
away
from
the
party
every
evening
to
walk
down
home
with
her
wise
little
chaperon
i
can
see
roger
and
louis
now
glaring
at
each
other
as
the
hour
approaches
for
her
departure
what
do
you
think
of
my
plan
it
only
a
plan
you
know
tony
subject
to
your
approval
diplomat
murmured
anthony
reaching
up
one
arm
and
drawing
it
about
her
shoulders
you
know
you
safe
to
have
my
approval
when
you
put
it
in
that
tone
well
provided
you
can
figure
out
the
finances
and
i
know
you
would
propose
it
if
you
had
done
that
already
i
do
see
any
objection
on
one
condition
though
julie
mind
you
on
one
condition
name
it
of
course
i
can
only
be
here
evenings
during
your
house
party
so
my
condition
is
that
i
have
you
and
the
home
all
to
myself
for
my
vacation
afterward
not
a
wooer
nor
a
chum
admitted
no
overdressed
women
out
from
town
taking
afternoon
tea
no
invitations
to
lonesome
husbands
out
to
dinner
just
you
and
i
did
you
ever
imagine
life
in
the
rural
localities
would
be
so
gay
anyhow
i
want
to
go
fishing
with
you
tramping
through
the
woods
with
you
sitting
out
here
on
the
porch
with
you
in
short
have
you
all
to
myself
and
he
turned
completely
about
kneeling
below
her
on
the
step
crushing
her
in
both
arms
so
vigorously
that
he
stopped
her
breath
eat
you
up
what
a
prospect
she
cried
softly
when
she
found
herself
partially
released
are
you
sure
you
need
a
vacation
just
for
that
certain
of
it
i
had
to
share
you
with
other
people
all
the
year
and
now
i
got
to
give
you
up
to
a
jealous
lovers
assemblage
so
after
that
mind
you
i
have
my
satisfaction
when
doctor
barnes
was
told
of
the
plan
he
looked
gloomy
going
to
ask
lockwood
he
inquired
at
once
of
course
assented
juliet
promptly
i
do
see
any
course
about
it
what
would
marie
dresser
do
to
me
if
i
did
invite
him
he
does
care
for
her
oh
yes
he
does
why
last
winter
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
asking
her
to
marry
him
everybody
expected
the
announcement
any
day
last
winter
and
this
summer
are
two
different
propositions
marie
does
think
so
she
get
mightily
undeceived
then
whom
else
are
you
asking
stevens
cathcart
the
doctor
groaned
is
this
a
dose
you
fixing
for
me
i
going
to
be
too
busy
i
ca
come
very
well
said
juliet
placidly
she
was
sewing
upon
the
porch
and
the
doctor
sat
on
the
step
he
looked
up
with
a
grimace
i
suppose
you
think
i
be
out
on
the
next
train
after
the
rest
arrive
i
certainly
do
roger
williams
barnes
i
presume
you
are
inviting
suzanne
he
queried
why
not
no
reason
why
not
cathcart
admires
her
immensely
or
did
before
he
began
to
cultivate
this
place
juliet
laughed
suzanne
would
never
forgive
you
if
she
heard
that
said
the
doctor
slowly
has
she
ever
met
miss
redding
no
he
meditated
for
several
minutes
in
silence
while
juliet
sewed
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
one
of
the
most
attractive
masculine
profiles
with
which
she
was
familiar
he
was
not
as
handsome
a
man
as
louis
lockwood
but
every
line
of
his
face
stood
for
strength
not
without
some
pretensions
to
good
looks
he
looked
up
at
length
and
straight
at
her
would
you
mind
telling
me
he
began
just
what
you
intend
to
effect
with
this
combination
i
never
gave
you
credit
you
know
juliet
for
wanting
to
manage
fate
and
i
do
believe
it
now
no
i
do
want
to
manage
fate
said
juliet
smiling
over
her
work
but
i
admit
i
want
two
things
i
want
you
to
see
rachel
redding
beside
suzanne
gerard
and
i
want
rachel
to
see
you
beside
louis
lockwood
and
suzanne
i
see
said
the
doctor
grimly
in
other
words
you
want
your
protégée
to
have
fair
play
just
that
juliet
answered
more
gravely
now
i
think
lots
of
you
roger
and
well
of
you
you
know
i
do
and
yet
and
yet
let
me
guard
my
girl
she
not
like
the
others
and
you
and
louis
are
making
it
tremendously
hard
for
her
between
you
you
seem
to
be
planning
to
make
it
infinitely
harder
juliet
shook
her
head
trust
me
roger
please
all
right
i
will
promised
the
doctor
but
just
assure
me
that
on
my
side
i
on
nobody
side
was
all
the
comfort
he
got
juliet
invitations
received
delighted
acceptances
though
wayne
carey
and
doctor
barnes
would
be
able
to
come
out
only
for
the
nights
in
time
however
for
late
and
festive
suppers
outdoors
the
tent
in
the
orchard
with
its
comfortable
bunks
was
accepted
by
all
the
men
with
enthusiasm
and
to
satisfy
the
men
is
the
essential
thing
you
know
tony
juliet
had
observed
sagely
when
she
saw
their
pleasure
in
their
quarters
the
girls
will
accept
any
crowding
together
if
they
have
a
mirror
and
room
to
tie
a
sash
in
as
long
as
devoted
admirers
are
not
wanting
the
moment
miss
dresser
and
miss
gerard
saw
miss
rachel
redding
to
quote
anthony
the
fun
began
wayne
carey
had
already
met
her
and
had
been
carefully
coached
by
juliet
as
to
the
bearing
she
must
assume
toward
juliet
new
friend
so
when
marie
and
suzanne
began
to
inquire
of
judith
the
latter
was
prepared
to
answer
them
she
a
beauty
in
her
way
is
she
judith
asserted
immensely
fond
of
her
i
should
judge
but
who
is
she
demanded
suzanne
a
neighbour
a
country
girl
a
school
and
college
girl
a
comparatively
poor
girl
and
a
lucky
girl
for
juliet
likes
her
have
the
men
met
her
before
goodness
yes
have
you
heard
how
they
beg
invitations
home
to
dinner
of
anthony
just
to
see
her
judith
was
enjoying
the
situation
this
statement
however
was
no
part
of
juliet
coaching
i
did
see
anything
particularly
attractive
about
her
said
marie
promptly
she
a
demure
thing
one
would
think
she
ever
lifted
those
long
lashes
to
look
at
a
man
but
that
just
the
kind
awfully
plainly
dressed
that
her
style
said
suzanne
these
poor
pretty
girls
are
once
in
a
while
just
clever
enough
to
make
capital
out
of
their
poverty
by
wearing
simply
fetching
things
in
pale
gray
dimity
and
dark
blue
lawn
and
sunbonnets
stevens
cathcart
would
be
just
the
kind
to
be
carried
away
with
her
roger
barnes
would
look
at
her
twice
louis
might
pretend
to
admire
her
to
please
juliet
admitted
marie
he
has
a
way
of
making
every
girl
think
he
is
in
love
with
her
and
he
is
to
a
certain
extent
but
it
never
serious
whether
it
were
serious
in
this
instance
miss
dresser
soon
had
opportunity
to
judge
after
dinner
that
first
night
anthony
proposed
taking
all
his
guests
out
upon
the
river
in
a
big
he
had
rented
but
when
he
made
up
the
party
rachel
was
not
to
be
found
i
afraid
she
gone
home
said
juliet
i
run
down
and
see
proposed
lockwood
instantly
and
was
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
when
cathcart
got
off
ahead
of
him
i
have
her
back
presently
he
called
as
he
dashed
down
the
road
you
people
go
on
we
catch
you
we
wait
for
you
lockwood
shouted
after
him
why
should
we
wait
demurred
marie
beginning
to
walk
away
toward
the
river
if
we
do
he
liable
not
to
find
it
convenient
to
catch
up
with
us
lockwood
retorted
if
they
prefer
their
own
company
why
not
let
them
have
it
she
said
over
her
shoulder
run
along
louis
murmured
doctor
barnes
one
girl
at
a
time
he
turned
to
juliet
shall
we
go
he
said
anthony
caught
his
glance
and
laughing
turned
to
suzanne
will
you
console
an
old
married
man
miss
gerard
he
inquired
but
when
cathcart
reappeared
which
he
did
very
soon
rachel
was
not
with
him
she
said
she
had
to
stay
with
her
mother
he
explained
in
a
tone
which
so
closely
resembled
a
growl
that
everybody
laughed
bear
up
stevie
boy
chaffed
wayne
carey
i
confident
she
likes
you
but
she
may
not
like
you
all
the
time
you
know
they
seldom
do
rachel
causes
anxiety
in
spite
of
all
juliet
efforts
to
bring
about
rachel
presence
as
one
of
her
guests
she
found
herself
unable
to
accomplish
it
whenever
she
was
needed
for
help
rachel
was
never
absent
but
the
moment
she
was
free
the
girl
was
off
and
that
quite
without
the
appearance
of
running
away
the
men
of
the
party
followed
her
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
remain
the
girls
confident
that
her
disappearances
were
part
of
a
very
deep
game
begged
her
to
stay
it
was
useless
rachel
excuses
were
ready
her
manner
charmingly
regretful
in
a
quiet
way
but
stay
she
would
not
roger
barnes
waylaid
her
one
evening
as
she
was
vanishing
down
the
path
by
the
brook
leading
to
her
own
home
here
you
go
again
he
began
discontentedly
i
wish
i
knew
why
rachel
paused
it
was
difficult
to
do
otherwise
with
a
large
and
determined
figure
blocking
a
very
narrow
path
i
have
ever
so
many
things
waiting
at
home
for
me
to
do
at
nine
in
the
evening
at
whatever
hour
i
am
through
at
mrs
robeson
i
wish
i
could
imagine
something
of
what
they
are
it
might
relieve
my
mind
a
little
why
i
will
tell
you
said
rachel
with
great
appearance
of
frankness
i
have
to
do
some
mending
for
mother
read
the
evening
paper
for
father
and
set
the
bread
then
the
clothes
must
be
sprinkled
for
ironing
in
the
morning
the
doctor
studied
her
face
in
the
dimming
light
who
washed
the
clothes
he
asked
bluntly
do
you
think
you
ought
to
ask
said
rachel
yes
i
in
the
habit
of
asking
questions
of
patients
of
everybody
i
care
for
you
do
have
to
answer
but
if
you
do
i
shall
know
who
did
the
washing
yes
i
did
it
said
rachel
steadily
it
is
easily
done
and
then
you
came
over
here
and
got
breakfast
not
at
all
i
helped
robeson
and
mary
mckaim
get
it
doctor
barnes
do
you
know
that
you
are
standing
directly
in
my
path
certainly
said
the
doctor
it
what
i
here
for
then
i
shall
have
to
go
back
and
take
the
road
home
if
you
do
you
will
evade
me
only
to
encounter
another
man
keeping
a
ferret
eye
on
the
robeson
house
door
and
i
think
cathcart
is
already
patrolling
the
road
in
front
of
your
house
the
girl
turned
you
are
making
me
feel
very
absurd
she
said
i
want
to
go
home
doctor
barnes
please
let
me
pass
you
may
i
go
with
you
i
would
rather
not
well
that
frank
he
said
amusement
and
chagrin
struggling
for
the
uppermost
i
wonder
i
do
stalk
angrily
away
i
wish
you
would
roger
barnes
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
i
wish
you
would
give
some
other
girls
a
leaf
out
of
your
book
he
said
the
more
you
turn
me
down
the
more
ardently
i
long
to
be
with
you
while
the
opposite
sort
of
thing
i
tell
you
miss
redding
if
you
want
to
be
rid
of
me
try
these
tactics
say
with
a
languishing
smile
doctor
barnes
wo
you
take
me
a
little
way
down
this
lovely
path
perhaps
that
will
accomplish
your
ends
i
often
felt
an
instant
desire
not
to
do
the
thing
i
begged
to
doctor
barnes
said
rachel
redding
and
he
caught
the
mischief
in
her
tone
even
rachel
could
be
mischievous
as
juliet
had
said
you
take
me
a
little
way
down
this
lovely
path
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
replied
the
doctor
promptly
and
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
him
whereupon
she
slipped
by
him
and
before
he
could
realise
that
she
had
gone
was
running
fleetly
away
in
the
twilight
down
the
winding
path
with
an
exclamation
he
was
off
after
her
but
though
he
dashed
at
the
pace
of
a
hunter
through
the
intricacies
of
the
way
he
presently
discovered
that
he
was
following
nothing
but
the
summer
breeze
rustling
the
willow
leaves
and
wafting
into
his
face
the
breath
of
hay
the
aftermath
of
late
july
he
stopped
at
length
and
stared
about
him
baffled
and
half
angry
there
never
was
a
girl
like
you
he
muttered
if
you
are
deliberately
trying
to
make
men
mad
to
get
you
you
are
succeeding
infuriatingly
well
if
i
catch
you
it
will
be
your
fault
if
i
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
i
tell
you
now
for
i
suppose
you
are
hiding
somewhere
in
this
undergrowth
till
i
give
it
up
and
you
can
get
away
home
you
shall
listen
to
me
if
you
are
here
for
you
ca
help
yourself
he
was
speaking
in
a
low
even
tone
walking
slowly
along
the
path
and
peering
sharply
into
the
bushes
on
both
sides
suddenly
he
stood
still
he
had
detected
a
spot
beside
a
willow
which
showed
nearly
white
in
the
deepening
darkness
rachel
was
wearing
white
he
remembered
his
heart
quickened
its
paces
and
he
paused
an
instant
to
get
past
a
certain
tightening
in
his
throat
then
he
bent
forward
and
whispered
if
that
not
you
there
i
can
say
what
i
like
and
there
be
some
satisfaction
in
that
if
you
speak
now
you
may
save
yourself
but
if
you
do
i
no
reason
to
think
you
and
so
i
can
say
there
was
a
sharply
perceptible
noise
farther
down
the
path
toward
the
redding
home
barnes
turned
quickly
and
stood
up
straight
waiting
footsteps
came
rapidly
along
the
path
no
footsteps
of
hers
evidently
a
man
voice
humming
a
tune
grew
momentarily
plainer
then
the
voice
stopped
humming
and
began
to
sing
in
a
subdued
but
clear
and
fine
barytone
down
through
the
lane
come
i
again
seeking
my
love
for
you
run
to
me
dear
losing
all
fear
love
and
the
voice
stopped
two
men
figures
confronted
each
other
in
an
extremely
narrow
path
it
was
not
too
dark
yet
for
each
to
be
plainly
recognisable
to
the
other
hallo
that
you
lockwood
hi
there
roger
barnes
what
you
doing
here
fishing
looking
for
something
i
lost
getting
pretty
dark
to
find
it
something
valuable
rather
think
i
give
it
up
for
too
bad
nice
night
lockwood
was
hastening
toward
the
end
of
the
path
which
came
out
near
anthony
house
barnes
looked
after
him
grimly
that
voice
of
yours
young
man
he
thought
handicaps
me
from
the
start
now
if
i
could
just
warble
my
emotions
that
way
he
turned
and
peered
again
at
the
white
place
by
the
tree
he
moved
stealthily
toward
it
and
ascertained
presently
that
it
was
not
what
it
seemed
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
walked
rapidly
down
the
path
to
the
redding
house
when
he
came
in
sight
of
it
he
saw
that
the
kitchen
windows
were
lighted
and
that
a
man
stood
with
his
arm
on
the
sill
of
one
of
them
silhouetted
against
the
light
were
the
familiar
outlines
of
stevens
cathcart
as
barnes
stood
staring
amazedly
at
this
a
slender
figure
in
white
came
to
the
window
and
in
the
stillness
he
could
hear
the
quiet
voice
please
let
me
close
the
window
cathcart
thank
you
no
and
men
in
a
boat
by
rachel
redding
murmured
the
doctor
to
himself
and
slipped
back
to
the
willow
path
from
which
he
at
length
emerged
to
join
the
group
upon
the
porch
which
then
it
may
be
observed
held
for
the
first
time
that
night
its
full
complement
of
men
three
big
chinese
lanterns
shed
a
softly
pleasant
light
upon
the
porch
and
the
lawn
at
its
foot
suzanne
gerard
and
marie
dresser
made
a
most
attractive
picture
one
in
a
low
chair
the
other
upon
a
pile
of
cushions
on
the
step
suzanne
lightly
picked
a
mandolin
marie
was
singing
softly
down
through
the
lane
come
i
again
seeking
my
love
for
you
run
to
me
dear
losing
all
fear
love
and
my
life
will
be
true
it
was
one
of
the
songs
of
the
summer
foolish
words
seductive
music
everybody
hummed
it
half
the
time
roger
barnes
smiled
to
himself
remembering
where
he
had
heard
it
last
come
here
and
give
account
commanded
suzanne
the
instant
he
appeared
every
unmarried
man
vanished
the
moment
twilight
fell
you
are
the
last
to
show
your
face
i
challenge
you
one
and
all
to
swear
that
you
have
not
been
within
sight
of
a
certain
small
brown
house
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
since
supper
her
voice
was
music
in
her
eyes
was
laughter
marie
sang
on
pointing
her
words
with
smiles
at
one
and
another
of
the
culprits
from
his
seat
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
where
his
head
rested
against
juliet
knee
as
she
sat
behind
him
anthony
laughed
to
himself
then
he
turned
his
head
and
whispered
to
his
wife
feel
the
claws
through
the
velvet
poor
boys
they
have
my
sympathy
an
unknown
quantity
rachel
said
juliet
decisively
next
morning
is
the
last
of
my
house
party
and
i
refuse
to
let
you
off
i
asking
ten
or
twelve
more
people
out
from
town
you
must
spend
this
evening
with
my
guests
or
forfeit
my
friendship
she
was
smiling
as
she
said
it
but
her
tone
was
not
to
be
denied
if
that
is
the
alternative
rachel
answered
returning
the
smile
with
an
affectionate
look
of
a
sort
which
neither
louis
lockwood
nor
stevens
cathcart
nor
roger
barnes
had
ever
seen
on
her
face
though
they
had
dreamed
of
it
of
course
i
shall
stay
but
i
tell
you
frankly
i
would
rather
not
why
not
rachel
i
think
you
know
why
not
robeson
rachel
answered
yes
i
know
why
not
admitted
juliet
girls
are
queer
things
ray
they
defeat
their
own
ends
all
the
time
lots
of
them
suzanne
and
marie
are
dear
girls
with
ever
so
many
nice
things
about
them
but
they
do
they
do
know
enough
not
to
pursue
chase
run
down
the
object
of
their
desires
and
of
course
the
object
being
run
down
panting
into
a
corner
dodges
evades
gets
out
and
runs
away
rachel
dear
what
are
you
going
to
wear
my
best
frock
said
rachel
smiling
which
is
white
cut
out
at
the
neck
a
little
short
in
the
sleeves
to
the
elbows
it
was
my
sophomore
evening
dress
it
will
be
all
right
i
know
rachel
wear
a
white
rose
in
those
low
black
braids
of
yours
will
you
no
i
think
i
wo
refused
rachel
why
not
rachel
did
not
answer
into
her
cool
cheek
crept
a
tinge
of
rebellious
telltale
colour
juliet
studied
her
a
minute
in
silence
then
came
up
to
her
and
laying
both
hands
on
her
shoulders
looked
up
into
her
eyes
you
try
to
fair
do
you
dear
she
said
heartily
whatever
the
rest
may
do
and
whatever
they
may
do
rachel
redding
do
you
care
it
not
your
fault
that
they
are
as
jealous
of
you
as
girls
can
be
and
keep
sweet
outside
i
be
jealous
of
you
myself
if
she
paused
laughing
when
you
grow
jealous
said
rachel
it
will
be
because
you
have
grown
blind
if
anybody
ever
wore
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
no
not
there
but
beating
sturdily
in
the
right
place
for
one
woman
in
the
world
it
right
you
are
said
anthony
robeson
coming
up
behind
them
and
i
hope
you
may
convince
her
of
it
she
has
no
confidence
in
her
own
powers
rachel
stood
looking
at
them
a
moment
her
dark
eyes
very
bright
to
see
you
two
she
said
slowly
at
length
is
to
believe
it
all
the
evening
promised
to
be
a
gay
one
the
men
of
the
party
had
sent
to
town
for
many
lanterns
flags
and
decorations
of
the
sort
and
had
made
the
porch
and
lawn
the
setting
for
a
brilliant
scene
a
dozen
young
people
had
been
asked
out
and
came
enthusiastically
we
wind
up
with
a
flourish
said
anthony
in
his
wife
ear
as
they
descended
the
stairs
together
and
then
we
send
them
all
off
where
they
cease
from
troubling
i
think
it
was
the
best
plan
in
the
world
but
i
be
glad
to
prowl
about
my
beloved
home
without
observing
cathcart
scowling
at
lockwood
roger
barnes
evading
suzanne
or
even
my
good
boy
wayne
with
that
eternal
wonder
on
his
face
as
to
why
his
flat
does
not
look
like
our
eden
hush
and
do
look
too
happy
tony
oh
here
comes
rachel
is
she
lovely
now
watch
murmured
anthony
his
face
full
of
amusement
it
as
good
as
the
best
comedy
i
ever
saw
see
suzanne
she
never
looked
toward
rachel
but
do
tell
me
she
was
aware
of
the
very
instant
rachel
came
upon
the
porch
i
believe
she
read
it
in
roger
barnes
face
i
wager
ten
to
one
his
pulse
is
countable
at
the
present
instant
i
do
blame
him
juliet
answered
smiling
at
her
guests
she
my
ideal
of
a
girl
who
wo
hold
out
a
finger
to
the
men
yes
she
your
sort
admitted
anthony
i
know
what
it
is
poor
fellows
i
been
through
it
your
cold
shoulder
used
to
warm
up
my
heart
hotter
than
any
other
girl
kindness
look
at
the
boys
now
they
jump
and
run
away
from
the
other
girls
but
they
like
to
and
all
deadly
anxious
for
fear
the
others
will
get
the
start
say
julie
you
ought
not
to
have
asked
those
new
youngsters
down
from
town
they
catch
it
sure
as
fate
they
at
the
susceptible
age
i
see
five
of
them
now
all
staring
at
rachel
you
positively
must
stay
here
with
me
any
longer
whispered
juliet
go
and
devote
yourself
to
her
and
keep
them
off
for
a
little
not
on
your
life
anthony
returned
she
can
take
care
of
herself
if
i
mix
up
in
this
fray
you
likely
to
be
husbandless
lockwood
and
roger
are
getting
dangerous
and
i
going
to
keep
on
the
outskirts
where
safe
they
were
all
upon
the
lawn
rachel
unable
to
help
herself
according
to
anthony
intimation
the
centre
of
a
group
of
men
who
would
not
give
each
other
a
chance
when
a
stranger
appeared
upon
the
edge
of
the
circle
of
light
he
stood
watching
the
scene
for
a
moment
a
tall
slender
fellow
with
a
pale
face
and
eyes
then
he
asked
somebody
to
tell
miss
redding
that
huntington
would
like
to
speak
with
her
rachel
thus
summoned
rose
looked
about
her
caught
sight
of
the
stranger
and
went
swiftly
down
the
lawn
a
dozen
people
among
them
all
the
men
who
had
been
the
guests
of
the
week
saw
the
meeting
they
observed
that
the
newcomer
put
out
both
hands
that
his
smile
was
very
bright
and
that
he
stood
looking
down
into
miss
redding
face
as
if
at
sight
of
it
he
had
instantly
forgotten
everything
else
in
the
world
rachel
leaving
him
came
back
up
the
lawn
to
find
her
hostess
as
she
passed
it
became
evident
to
a
good
many
pairs
of
sharp
eyes
that
her
beauty
had
received
a
keen
accession
from
the
sweeping
over
her
cheeks
of
a
burning
blush
so
unusual
that
they
could
not
fail
to
take
note
of
it
juliet
came
back
down
the
lawn
with
rachel
who
presented
huntington
and
presently
without
a
word
of
to
any
one
else
the
two
went
away
down
the
road
now
who
under
the
heavens
was
that
grunted
louis
lockwood
in
ear
catching
his
host
around
the
corner
of
the
house
do
know
brother
perhaps
has
any
relative
do
know
just
a
messenger
maybe
give
it
up
she
blushed
like
anything
did
she
man
she
is
going
to
marry
probably
oh
that
ca
be
the
lady
looks
marriageable
to
me
observed
anthony
strolling
away
he
ran
into
cathcart
say
who
was
that
fellow
tony
began
stevens
do
ask
me
he
looked
confoundedly
as
if
he
meant
to
embrace
her
on
the
spot
so
he
did
agreed
anthony
soothingly
do
blame
him
do
you
he
may
not
have
seen
her
for
a
month
what
condition
do
you
suppose
you
be
in
if
a
week
should
get
away
from
you
out
of
her
vicinity
bother
you
tony
do
you
know
who
he
was
intimate
friend
i
should
judge
she
turned
pink
as
a
carnation
say
hollyhock
suggested
anthony
or
peony
only
a
vivid
colour
could
do
justice
to
it
that
right
groaned
cathcart
she
never
looked
like
that
for
any
of
us
never
said
anthony
promptly
and
got
away
chuckling
hold
on
there
robeson
man
said
the
voice
of
roger
barnes
and
anthony
found
himself
again
held
up
come
on
old
roger
boy
said
his
host
pleasantly
we
amble
down
the
road
a
bit
and
give
you
a
chance
to
get
a
grip
on
yourself
no
i
know
who
he
is
i
all
worn
out
assuring
louis
and
steve
of
that
she
did
turn
red
she
did
look
upset
with
joy
i
infer
that
girl
has
made
more
havoc
in
one
short
week
playing
off
all
the
while
too
than
suzanne
and
marie
have
accomplished
in
the
biggest
season
they
ever
knew
and
i
believe
roger
boy
you
about
the
hardest
hit
of
any
of
them
the
doctor
did
not
answer
the
two
had
walked
away
from
the
house
and
were
marching
arm
in
arm
at
a
good
pace
down
the
road
she
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
suggested
anthony
there
was
no
reply
she
has
a
dead
weight
of
a
helpless
father
and
mother
the
doctor
put
match
to
a
cigar
juliet
says
her
brother
died
of
dissipation
in
a
doctor
barnes
began
to
chew
hard
on
a
cigar
that
he
had
failed
to
light
but
she
a
mighty
sweet
girl
said
anthony
softly
see
here
tony
the
doctor
burst
oh
hang
it
all
i
see
said
his
friend
with
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
go
ahead
roger
barnes
there
nothing
in
life
like
it
and
the
good
lord

mercy
on
you
for
the
sort
of
girl
worth
caring
for
does
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
all
gone
little
girl
said
anthony
jubilantly
as
he
turned
back
into
the
house
the
next
evening
after
watching
out
of
sight
the
big
of
lockwood
which
had
carried
all
his
away
at
once
they
are
mighty
fine
people
and
i
like
them
all
immensely
but
i
have
enjoyed
to
the
full
this
speeding
the
parting
guest
and
now
for
my
vacation
it
begins
what
shall
we
do
asked
juliet
allowing
him
to
draw
her
into
his
favourite
settle
corner
go
fishing
if
you
put
up
a
jolly
little
i
mean
a
jolly
big
lunch
and
array
yourself
in
unspoilable
attire
i
give
you
a
day
great
sport
whether
we
catch
any
fish
or
not
there
one
fish
you
sure
of
he
always
on
the
end
of
your
line
hooked
fast
and
resigned
to
his
fate
juliet
are
they
really
all
gone
i
sure
they
are
good
mary
mckaim
peace
be
to
her
ashes
for
she
never
gets
any
on
the
toast
has
she
gone
too
she
packing
rachel
safe
at
home
with
her
presumable
fiancé
he
ca
be
her
fiancé
tony
that
what
lockwood
said
but
i
suppose
he
can
just
the
same
rachel
away
do
you
say
yes
she
did
come
over
at
all
you
know
i
noticed
it
by
the
gloom
on
three
stalwart
men
faces
well
if
everybody
safely
out
of
the
way
i
going
to
commit
myself
to
what
tony
she
was
laughing
for
he
had
risen
looked
all
about
him
with
great
anxiety
tiptoed
to
each
door
and
listened
at
it
and
was
now
come
back
to
stand
before
her
smiling
down
at
her
and
holding
out
his
arms
to
the
statement
he
said
gathering
her
close
and
speaking
into
her
upturned
rosy
face
that
without
doubt
this
is
the
dearest
home
in
the
world
and
that
you
are
the
sweetest
woman
who
ever
has
stood
or
ever
will
stand
here
in
it
all
the
april
stars
are
out
it
was
an
april
night
balmy
with
the
breath
of
an
exceptionally
early
spring
all
the
april
stars
were
out
as
anthony
came
to
the
door
of
the
little
house
and
opening
it
flung
himself
out
upon
the
porch
drawing
great
breaths
he
looked
up
into
the
sky
and
clasped
his
arms
tightly
over
his
breast
o
god
he
said
aloud
take
care
of
her
he
went
back
into
the
house
after
a
minute
and
paced
the
floor
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
stopping
at
each
turn
to
listen
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
then
took
up
his
stride
again
his
lips
set
his
eyes
dark
with
anxiety
over
and
over
he
went
to
the
open
door
to
look
up
at
the
stars
as
if
somehow
he
could
bear
his
ordeal
best
outdoors
when
half
the
night
had
gone
dingley
came
downstairs
anthony
met
her
at
the
foot
she
smiled
reassuringly
into
his
face
this
is
hard
for
you
dear
boy
she
said
but
they
think
by
morning
morning
he
cried
everything
is
going
well
it
only
two
morning
she
says
tell
you
she
going
to
be
very
happy
soon
but
at
that
anthony
turned
away
where
his
face
could
not
be
seen
and
stood
by
the
open
door
dingley
laid
an
affectionate
hand
on
his
arm
do
worry
tony
she
said
gently
i
ca
help
it
this
is
new
to
you
juliet
is
young
and
strong
and
full
of
courage
bless
her
in
the
morning
you
both
be
very
happy
i
hope
so
why
anthony
dear
said
the
kindly
little
woman
i
never
knew
you
to
be
so
faint
of
heart
anthony
faced
around
again
if
my
strength
could
do
her
any
good
i
be
a
lion
for
her
he
said
but
when
all
i
can
do
is
to
wait
and
think
what
i
do
if
he
was
gone
suddenly
into
the
night
with
a
tender
smile
on
her
lips
dingley
went
on
upon
the
errand
which
had
brought
her
downstairs
worth
something
to
a
woman
to
be
able
to
make
a
man
heart
ache
like
that
she
said
to
herself
with
a
little
sigh
anthony
would
not
have
understood
but
even
in
this
hour
the
older
woman
in
her
wisdom
was
envying
juliet
morning
came
at
last
as
mornings
do
with
the
first
streaks
of
the
gray
dawn
anthony
heard
a
little
strange
cry
new
to
his
ears
he
leaped
up
the
stairs
four
at
a
time
and
paused
breathless
by
the
closed
door
of
the
room
after
what
seemed
to
him
an
interminable
time
dingley
came
out
at
sight
of
anthony
her
face
broke
into
smiles
and
at
the
same
moment
tears
filled
her
eyes
it
a
splendid
boy
tony
she
said
i
meant
to
come
to
you
the
first
minute
but
i
waited
to
be
perfectly
sure
he
did
breathe
well
at
first
but
anthony
pushed
this
news
aside
impatiently
juliet
he
questioned
eagerly
she
all
right
you
poor
man
dingley
assured
him
you
shall
see
her
presently
just
for
a
minute
the
first
thing
she
said
was
tony
go
down
now
i
call
you
soon
anthony
stole
away
downstairs
to
the
outer
door
again
this
time
he
ran
out
upon
the
porch
and
down
the
lawn
and
orchard
in
the
early
to
the
willow
path
by
the
brook
he
dashed
along
this
path
to
its
end
and
back
again
as
if
he
must
in
some
way
give
expression
to
his
relief
from
the
tension
of
the
night
but
he
was
back
and
waiting
impatiently
long
before
he
received
his
summons
to
his
wife
room
on
his
way
up
he
wrung
the
friendly
hand
of
joseph
wilberforce
the
best
man
in
the
city
at
times
like
these
and
thanked
him
in
a
few
uneven
words
then
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
do
be
afraid
tony
said
a
very
sweet
clear
voice
we
ever
so
well
anthony
robeson
junior
and
i
anthony
robeson
senior
walked
across
the
room
in
a
dim
gray
fog
which
obscured
nearly
everything
except
the
sight
of
a
pair
of
eyes
which
were
shining
upon
him
brightly
enough
to
penetrate
any
fog
at
the
bedside
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
i
suppose
i
an
awful
chump
he
murmured
but
nothing
ever
broke
me
up
so
in
all
my
life
juliet
laughed
it
was
not
a
sentimental
greeting
but
she
understood
all
it
meant
but
i
so
happy
dear
she
said
are
you
somehow
i
ca
seem
to
be
yet
i
too
badly
scared
he
such
a
beautiful
big
boy
i
suppose
i
shall
be
devoted
to
him
some
time
but
all
i
can
think
of
now
is
to
make
sure
i
got
you
the
nurse
in
her
white
cap
came
softly
in
and
glanced
at
tony
meaningly
if
you
come
in
here
you
may
see
your
son
robeson
she
said
and
went
out
again
anthony
bent
over
his
wife
he
whispered
with
a
kiss
and
obediently
went
across
the
hall
he
stood
looking
dazedly
down
at
the
round
warm
bundle
the
nurse
laid
in
his
arms
my
son
he
said
how
odd
that
sounds
then
he
hastily
gave
the
bundle
back
to
the
nurse
and
got
away
downstairs
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
never
dreamed
it
was
going
to
knock
me
over
like
this
he
was
saying
to
himself
i
ca
look
at
her
i
ca
look
at
him
i
feel
like
a
big
boy
who
has
seen
a
little
fellow
take
his
thrashing
for
him
and
in
this
humble
albeit
most
sincerely
thankful
frame
of
mind
he
absently
drank
his
breakfast
coffee
and
never
realised
that
in
her
confusion
of
spirit
good
mary
mckaim
who
was
here
again
in
time
of
need
had
brewed
him
instead
a
powerful
cup
of
tea
a
prior
claim
come
up
come
up
you
just
the
people
we
want
cried
anthony
heartily
from
his
own
porch
thought
you
be
getting
out
to
see
us
some
of
these
fine
august
nights
sit
down
juliet
will
be
out
in
a
minute
baby
asleep
asked
judith
carey
as
she
and
wayne
settled
comfortably
into
two
of
the
deep
bamboo
chairs
with
which
the
porch
was
furnished
to
be
sure
he
asleep
at
this
hour
anthony
assured
her
proudly
been
asleep
for
two
hours
regular
as
a
clock
that
youngster
nurse
trained
him
right
at
the
beginning
and
juliet
has
kept
it
up
four
months
old
now
and
sleeps
from
six
at
night
till
four
in
the
morning
without
waking
how
that
i
suppose
it
remarkable
agreed
wayne
meekly
but
i
do
know
anything
about
it
he
might
sleep
hours
out
of
i
should
understand
whether
to
call
him
a
prodigy
or
an
idiot
why
yes
you
would
judith
interposed
with
spirit
think
of
that
baby
on
the
floor
above
us
they
walking
the
floor
half
the
night
with
her
girl
babies
may
be
different
carey
suggested
diffidently
at
which
anthony
shouted
i
do
care
all
the
girls
i
ever
knew
wanted
to
sit
up
nights
carey
insisted
with
a
feeble
grin
juliet
came
out
welcoming
her
friends
with
the
cordiality
for
which
she
was
famous
it
so
hot
in
town
she
condoled
with
them
you
should
get
out
into
our
delicious
air
oftener
somehow
with
our
breezes
we
mind
the
heat
it
heaven
here
anyhow
sighed
carey
stretching
back
in
his
chair
with
a
long
breath
judith
looked
sober
you
say
it
heaven
commented
anthony
staring
hard
at
his
friend
and
you
profess
to
admire
everything
we
do
and
eat
and
say
but
you
continue
to
pay
good
money
every
week
for
a
lot
of
extremely
dubious
comforts
from
my
point
of
view
it
one
of
the
very
best
places
in
that
part
of
the
city
protested
judith
anthony
eyed
her
keenly
yes
if
that
what
you
paying
for
you
got
it
i
admit
if
it
a
consolation
to
you
to
know
that
the
address
you
give
when
you
go
shopping
is
one
that
you
not
ashamed
of
why
all
right
but
i
reckon
juliet
here
does
blush
when
she
orders
things
sent
home
to
the
country
oh
juliet
began
judith
she
does
need
an
address
to
make
all
the
salespeople
pay
her
their
most
respectful
attention
she
i
understand
said
anthony
that
sweetly
imperious
way
of
hers
when
she
shops
i
remember
it
the
first
time
i
ever
went
shopping
with
her
juliet
gave
him
a
laughing
glance
if
i
remember
she
said
it
was
i
who
did
all
the
dictating
on
that
historic
expedition
when
we
furnished
this
house
we
got
to
go
shopping
again
anthony
informed
them
we
planning
to
put
a
little
wing
on
the
house
opening
from
under
the
stairs
in
the
for
a
nursery
and
a
den
going
to
put
the
two
together
asked
a
new
voice
from
the
dimness
of
the
lawn
oh
hullo
roger
barnes
come
up
no
i
think
we
have
a
partition
between
but
i
want
a
room
below
stairs
for
tony
junior
so
his
mother
wo
wear
herself
out
carrying
him
up
and
down
that
youngster
weighs
seventeen
pounds
and
a
fraction
already
i
was
confident
i
get
some
statistics
if
i
came
out
said
the
doctor
settling
himself
near
juliet
with
a
purpose
as
she
instantly
recognised
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
wait
longer
to
learn
how
much
he
had
gained
since
i
met
tony
day
before
yesterday
it
was
seventeen
without
the
fraction
then
that
right
guy
me
returned
anthony
comfortably
i
do
mind
the
boy
i
want
a
talk
with
you
said
the
doctor
softly
to
juliet
as
the
others
fell
to
discussing
the
project
of
the
enlarged
house
i
got
to
have
it
too
or
go
off
my
head
juliet
nodded
understanding
him
presently
she
rose
i
have
an
errand
to
do
she
said
will
you
walk
over
to
the
evanstons
with
me
roger
now
tell
me
began
the
doctor
the
instant
they
were
off
is
she
going
to
persist
in
this
awful
sacrifice
poor
rachel
breathed
juliet
so
many
lovers
and
so
unhappy
is
she
unhappy
begged
the
doctor
is
she
if
i
only
were
sure
of
it
what
girl
would
be
unhappy
to
be
making
even
one
man
out
of
two
as
miserable
as
you
but
you
know
what
i
mean
is
she
going
to
marry
huntington
out
of
love
as
well
as
pity
or
only
pity
roger
juliet
stood
still
in
the
road
regarding
him
in
the
dim
light
with
kind
eyes
if
i
knew
i
would
tell
you
that
rachel
secret
but
i
do
know
she
as
loyal
as
a
magnet
and
as
reserved
as
you
would
want
her
to
be
if
you
were
mr
huntington
she
everything
she
ought
to
be
i
a
dastard
for
saying
it
but
i
could
forgive
her
for
being
disloyal
enough
to
him
to
show
me
just
a
corner
of
her
heart
even
if
she
loves
him
it
what
i
called
it
an
awful
sacrifice
a
man
dying
with
consumption
if
she
does
except
as
the
friend
of
her
early
girlhood
when
she
did
know
men
or
her
own
heart
juliet
it
impious
roger
dear
keep
hold
of
yourself
juliet
replied
you
too
strong
and
fine
to
want
to
come
between
her
and
her
own
decision
if
she
has
made
it
if
you
were
a
man
said
he
hotly
would
you
let
a
woman
marry
you
dying
yes
answered
juliet
stoutly
if
she
insisted
women
are
capable
of
saying
anything
in
an
argument
he
growled
i
say
it
outrageous
to
let
her
do
it
she
does
love
him
she
does
love
me
he
blurted
juliet
turned
to
him
anxiously
roger
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
yes
i
do
i
got
to
tell
somebody
and
there
nobody
but
you
you
perfect
woman
if
ever
a
man
knew
a
thing
without
its
being
put
into
words
i
know
that
it
was
only
a
look
weeks
ago
but
i
as
sure
of
it
as
i
am
of
myself
i
had
nothing
but
coolness
from
her
since
but
that
in
and
the
thought
that
loving
me
she
going
to
give
herself
to
him
a
wreck
do
you
wonder
it
driving
me
mad
you
ought
not
to
have
told
me
this
said
juliet
tears
in
her
voice
if
rachel
is
doing
this
it
because
she
sure
she
ought
of
course
she
is
and
that
why
i
tell
you
you
have
more
influence
with
her
than
any
one
ca
you
show
her
that
duty
the
most
urgent
in
the
world
never
requires
a
thing
like
that
let
her
be
his
friend
to
the
last
the
sort
of
friend
she
knows
how
to
be
with
a
warm
hand
in
his
cold
one
but
never
his
the
doctor
grew
choky
with
his
vehemence
and
stopped
short
juliet
was
silent
full
of
distress
she
thought
of
the
two
men
huntington
a
frail
ghost
in
the
grip
of
a
deadly
illness
yet
fighting
it
desperately
and
desperately
clinging
to
the
girl
he
loved
a
clever
fellow
educated
as
a
mining
engineer
successful
even
beginning
to
be
distinguished
in
his
work
until
his
health
gave
out
barnes
the
embodiment
of
strength
standing
high
in
his
profession
life
and
the
world
before
him
a
fit
mate
for
the
girl
who
deserved
the
best
there
could
be
for
her
juliet
thought
of
them
both
and
found
her
heart
aching
for
them
and
for
rachel
redding
they
were
slowly
approaching
the
brown
house
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
errand
at
the
evanstons
forgotten
when
suddenly
a
familiar
figure
in
white
came
toward
them
from
the
doorway
the
doctor
started
at
sight
of
it
and
juliet
grew
breathless
all
at
once
i
thought
it
was
you
two
said
rachel
this
rising
moon
struck
you
full
just
now
and
i
could
see
you
plainly
i
wanted
to
see
you
both
and
this
is
my
last
chance
i
am
going
away
there
was
an
instant
silence
while
roger
barnes
tried
to
choose
which
of
all
the
things
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
should
come
first
juliet
broke
the
stillness
walk
back
up
the
road
with
us
dear
she
said
and
tell
us
how
and
where
you
go
i
have
but
a
minute
to
spare
said
rachel
let
me
say
to
you
both
here
no
by
heaven
you
shall
not
burst
out
the
doctor
in
a
suppressed
voice
of
fire
which
startled
juliet
you
owe
me
ten
minutes
in
place
of
the
last
letter
you
have
answered
there
are
a
score
of
them
you
know
but
the
last
has
to
be
answered
somehow
rachel
hesitated
very
well
she
said
at
length
but
only
with
mrs
robeson
ca
you
trust
me
he
was
angry
now
yes
but
not
myself
she
answered
so
low
he
barely
caught
the
words
he
seized
her
hand
then
trust
me
for
us
both
he
said
so
instantly
gentle
and
tender
that
juliet
found
it
possible
to
say
what
a
moment
before
she
had
thought
unwise
enough
go
with
him
ray
dear
i
think
it
is
his
right
so
presently
she
found
herself
crossing
her
own
lawn
alone
while
the
two
who
had
just
left
her
went
slowly
on
up
the
road
together
her
heart
was
beating
hard
and
painfully
for
she
loved
them
both
and
foresaw
for
them
only
the
hardest
interview
of
their
lives
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
rachel
redding
stood
again
upon
her
own
porch
and
roger
barnes
looked
up
at
her
from
the
walk
below
with
heavy
eyes
at
least
he
said
you
have
done
what
i
never
would
have
believed
even
you
could
do
convinced
me
against
my
will
that
you
are
right
you
love
him
he
worships
you
there
is
a
promise
of
life
for
him
in
arizona
with
you
i
ca
forbid
the
bans
but
i
shall
always
believe
what
you
dare
not
dispute
that
if
i
had
come
first
you
she
held
out
her
hand
that
you
must
not
say
she
said
but
there
is
one
thing
you
may
say
that
you
are
my
best
friend
whom
i
can
count
on
as
long
as
there
is
life
left
in
me
he
answered
fervently
he
wrung
her
hand
in
both
his
looked
long
and
steadily
up
into
her
face
as
if
his
eyes
could
never
leave
the
lovely
outlines
showing
clear
in
the
light
from
the
windows
then
turned
away
and
strode
off
toward
the
station
without
a
look
behind
everybody
gives
advice
i
should
do
it
in
brown
leather
said
cathcart
decidedly
looking
about
him
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
anthony
den
the
carpenters
had
gone
the
plasterers
had
finished
their
work
and
the
floor
had
just
been
swept
up
you
all
right
as
far
as
you
go
observed
anthony
who
stood
at
his
elbow
but
you
do
go
far
enough
if
you
want
me
to
hang
these
walls
with
brown
leather
you
have
to
put
up
the
money
i
may
be
sufficiently
prosperous
to
afford
the
addition
to
my
house
but
i
have
reached
the
stage
of
covering
the
walls
with
burlap
would
be
the
thing
tony
judith
suggested
anthony
was
surrounded
by
people
the
room
was
half
full
of
them
elbowing
each
other
about
paint
the
walls
advised
lockwood
there
are
papers
said
cathcart
with
the
air
of
one
condescending
to
lower
a
high
standard
for
the
sake
of
those
who
could
not
live
up
to
it
i
suppose
so
admitted
anthony
at
four
dollars
a
roll
i
saw
a
simple
thing
on
that
order
that
struck
me
the
other
day
at
heminways
i
thought
it
might
be
about
forty
cents
a
roll
it
was
a
dollar
a
square
yard
i
told
them
i
would
think
it
over
i
have
got
through
thinking
it
over
yet
you
want
a
said
wayne
carey
what
for
why
to
put
plates
and
steins
and
things
on
have
a
plate
or
a
stein
baby
has
a
silver
mug
would
that
do
cathcart
smiled
in
a
superior
way
you
had
a
lot
of
mighty
fine
stuff
in
your
yale
days
he
remarked
pity
you
let
it
all
go
i
should
have
cared
for
that
truck
now
anthony
declared
easily
though
he
deceived
nobody
by
it
most
of
them
remembered
if
cathcart
had
forgotten
how
the
college
boy
had
sacrificed
all
his
treasures
at
a
blow
when
the
news
of
his
family
misfortunes
had
come
it
had
yielded
little
enough
after
all
to
throw
into
the
abyss
of
their
sudden
poverty
but
the
act
had
proved
the
spirit
of
the
elder
son
of
the
house
you
certainly
will
want
plenty
of
rugs
and
hangings
of
the
right
sort
cathcart
pursued
anthony
looked
at
him
i
can
see
that
you
have
got
to
be
suppressed
he
said
with
a
hand
on
stevens
collar
i
can
tell
you
in
a
breath
just
what
going
into
this
room
at
present
the
floor
is
to
have
a
matting
one
of
those
heavy
mattings
auntie
dingley
has
presented
me
with
one
fine
old
persian
rug
from
the
marcy
library
which
she
insists
is
out
of
key
with
the
rest
of
the
stuff
i
glad
it
is
it
furnish
the
key
to
my
decorations
then
i
a
splendid
old
desk
i
picked
up
in
a
place
where
they
temporarily
forgot
themselves
in
setting
a
price
on
it
that
going
by
the
window
i
a
little
dürer
engraving
and
a
few
good
foreign
photographs
juliet
has
put
under
glass
for
me
for
the
rest
i
have
what
i
like
best
clear
space
room
the
bamboo
chairs
off
the
porch
with
some
winter
cushions
in
my
books
and
that
he
pointed
to
the
windows
outside
which
lay
a
long
country
vista
stretching
away
over
fields
and
river
to
the
woods
in
the
distance
turning
rich
autumn
tints
now
under
the
late
october
frosts
it
enough
said
carey
with
the
suppressed
sigh
which
usually
accompanied
any
allusion
of
his
to
anthony
environment
dens
are
too
stuffy
as
a
rule
fellows
try
to
see
how
much
useless
lumber
they
can
accumulate
in
altogether
inadequate
space
but
you
ought
to
have
a
couch
said
judith
oh
yes
i
going
to
have
a
couch
assented
anthony
laughing
across
her
head
at
juliet
a
gem
of
a
couch
we
making
it
ourselves
not
to
see
it
till
it
done
it
be
no
brickbat
couch
either
it
be
a
flowery
bed
of
ease
or
if
not
flowery
invitingly
covered
with
some
stunning
stuff
juliet
has
fished
out
of
a
neighbour
attic
now
come
and
see
the
nursery
juliet
proposed
and
the
party
crowded
through
the
door
into
the
around
to
the
one
by
its
side
which
opened
into
an
attractive
room
behind
the
den
all
air
and
sunshine
i
refuse
to
suggest
said
cathcart
instantly
the
decorations
for
this
place
that
good
remarked
anthony
cheerfully
so
much
verbiage
out
of
the
way
it
be
pink
and
white
i
suppose
said
judith
pink
is
the
colour
for
boys
i
told
behind
all
their
backs
anthony
glanced
at
his
wife
affection
and
amusement
in
his
face
she
read
the
look
and
smiled
back
it
was
no
part
of
their
plan
to
let
the
boy
grow
up
alone
and
as
a
mother
she
seemed
to
him
far
more
beautiful
than
she
had
ever
been
we
are
going
to
have
a
little
paper
with
pictures
all
over
it
explained
juliet
there
are
all
sorts
of
softly
harmonising
colours
in
it
and
just
a
matting
on
the
floor
with
a
rug
to
play
on
his
white
crib
and
some
gay
little
curtains
at
the
windows
have
you
made
the
partition
old
man
asked
lockwood
this
combination
strikes
me
as
a
little
dubious
it
no
use
explaining
to
a
fiendish
old
bachelor
said
anthony
leading
the
way
out
of
the
place
that
i
think
i
was
missing
a
good
deal
if
i
should
get
so
far
away
that
i
could
hear
little
tony
laugh
or
cry
julie
where
the
boy
may
i
bring
him
down
he
disappeared
upstairs
whence
sounds
of
hilarity
were
at
once
heard
presently
he
reappeared
on
the
stairs
bearing
aloft
upon
his
shoulder
a
rosy
cherub
of
a
baby
smiling
and
waving
a
chubby
fist
at
the
company
the
beauty
in
his
face
was
an
exquisite
mixture
of
that
belonging
to
both
father
and
mother
anthony
and
his
son
together
made
a
picture
worth
seeing
once
more
wayne
carey
smothered
a
sigh
but
judith
hardened
her
heart
since
baby
anthony
had
come
wayne
had
been
difficult
to
manage
lockwood
stayed
after
the
others
had
gone
sitting
smoking
before
the
fire
with
anthony
after
juliet
had
left
them
alone
he
brought
the
conversation
around
to
a
point
which
anthony
had
expected
what
do
you
hear
of
that
man
huntington
he
asked
as
indifferently
as
a
man
is
ever
able
to
ask
a
question
which
means
much
to
him
huntington
why
the
last
was
that
he
was
improving
a
little
i
believe
arizona
is
a
great
place
for
that
sort
of
thing
good
deal
of
a
sacrifice
for
her
people
to
go
with
her
way
out
there
she
could
leave
them
behind
father
mother
a
cripple
i
understand
that
arizona
air
is
bracing
them
too
the
fellow
own
mother
was
one
of
the
party
was
she
i
believe
so
he
all
she
has
i
do
see
with
all
those
people
to
chaperon
her
why
she
could
have
gone
along
with
him
without
marrying
him
observed
lockwood
in
a
gruff
tone
anthony
smiled
that
would
have
been
a
tantalus
draught
indeed
he
remarked
i
imagine
poor
huntington
will
need
all
the
concessions
he
can
get
if
he
keeps
on
breathing
even
arizona
air
anthony
said
lockwood
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
during
which
he
had
puffed
away
with
his
eyes
intent
on
the
fire
do
you
fancy
rachel
redding
cared
enough
for
that
man
to
immolate
herself
like
that
looks
very
much
like
it
i
know
it
looks
like
it
but
if
i
read
that
girl
right
she
was
the
sort
to
stick
to
anything
she
said
she
do
if
it
took
the
breath
out
of
her
body
how
long
had
she
known
him
any
idea
a
good
while
i
believe
i
thought
so
early
engagement
you
see
ought
never
to
have
stood
if
you
been
huntington
you
probably
have
had
the
unreasonable
notion
that
it
should
she
a
magnificent
girl
said
lockwood
blowing
a
great
volume
of
smoke
into
the
air
with
head
elevated
and
eyes
she
made
those
two
who
were
here
with
her
last
summer
seem
like
thirty
cents
beside
her
nice
girls
too
fine
girls
elegant
dressers
i
do
know
what
the
matter
was
neither
did
they
he
chuckled
a
little
they
could
believe
their
own
eyes
when
they
saw
three
of
us
going
daft
over
a
girl
they
have
staked
a
copper
on
in
a
with
themselves
they
took
it
gamely
i
say
that
for
them
marie
wo
have
me
back
i
do
blame
her
neither
do
i
have
got
to
the
stage
sometimes
think
i
never
shall
one
experience
like
that
spoils
a
man
for
the
average
girl
the
truth
is
tony
the
most
of
them
er
overdo
the
act
i
want
a
girl
to
keep
me
guessing
till
the
last
minute
tell
that
to
the
girl
advised
anthony
i
wish
i
could
yet
there
were
a
good
many
times
when
i
thought
if
rachel
redding
would
just
look
my
way
i
should
take
it
ill
of
her
i
wonder
if
she
have
been
like
that
if
she
had
been
engaged
to
another
fellow
probably
anthony
got
up
and
stretched
himself
he
was
growing
weary
of
other
men
confidences
you
right
she
would
she
built
that
way
yet
when
you
get
to
fancying
what
she
be
if
she
just
let
herself
go
and
show
she
cared
look
here
my
young
friend
said
anthony
i
advise
you
to
go
home
and
go
to
bed
sitting
here
dreaming
over
alexander
huntington
is
good
for
you
what
you
want
to
be
doing
is
to
forget
her
huntington
going
to
get
well
and
they
going
to
live
happily
ever
after
and
you
fellows
out
here
can
look
up
other
girls
plenty
of
only
for
the
love
of
heaven
see
if
you
can
avoid
all
setting
your
affections
on
the
same
girl
next
time
it
too
rough
on
your
friends
roger
barnes
proves
invaluable
time
went
swinging
on
and
by
and
by
it
came
to
be
tony
robeson
junior
second
christmas
day
he
rode
down
to
breakfast
on
his
father
shoulder
crowing
loudly
on
a
gorgeous
brown
and
scarlet
rooster
which
he
had
found
on
his
christmas
tree
the
evening
before
he
had
been
put
to
bed
immediately
thereafter
and
had
gone
to
sleep
with
the
rooster
in
his
arms
the
fowl
had
a
charmingly
realistic
crow
operated
by
a
pneumatic
device
upon
which
the
baby
had
promptly
learned
to
blow
he
performed
upon
it
uninterruptedly
throughout
breakfast
see
here
my
son
said
anthony
hurriedly
finishing
his
coffee
see
if
you
ca
appreciate
some
of
your
less
voiceful
toys
here
a
rabbit
with
fine
soft
ears
for
you
to
pull
there
a
train
of
cars
let
me
wind
it
for
you
your
grandfather
marcy
must
have
expended
several
good
dollars
on
that
you
want
to
show
up
an
interest
in
it
when
he
comes
out
to
see
you
and
here
auntie
dingley
pickaninny
well
i
do
blame
you
for
failing
to
embrace
that
auntie
dingley
was
born
in
massachusetts
illustration
toys
which
can
be
relied
upon
to
please
a
twenty
months
old
infant
the
boy
cast
an
indifferently
polite
eye
on
these
gifts
as
their
charms
were
exhibited
to
him
and
clasped
the
brown
and
scarlet
rooster
to
his
breast
there
were
moments
half
hours
even
when
he
became
sufficiently
diverted
from
his
fowl
to
cease
from
making
it
crow
but
at
intervals
throughout
the
day
the
family
were
given
to
understand
once
for
all
that
it
is
not
the
most
expensive
and
ornate
toys
which
can
be
relied
upon
to
please
a
infant
even
the
automobile
presented
by
roger
barnes
and
warranted
to
go
three
times
around
the
room
without
stopping
was
a
tame
affair
to
the
recipient
compared
with
the
shrill
salute
remember
tony
juliet
had
said
a
month
before
christmas
you
are
not
to
give
me
any
expensive
personal
gift
this
year
i
care
for
nothing
half
so
much
as
for
making
the
home
complete
if
if
you
cared
to
give
me
something
toward
the
bathroom
fund
all
right
said
anthony
promptly
for
he
had
learned
by
this
time
to
know
his
wife
well
the
bathroom
fund
was
dear
to
her
heart
the
small
room
at
the
front
of
the
house
upstairs
which
had
been
left
unfurnished
had
been
temporarily
fitted
up
as
a
bathroom
by
sundry
ingenious
devices
in
the
way
of
a
tin
bath
and
a
hot
and
cold
water
connection
but
a
full
equipment
of
the
best
sort
was
to
be
put
in
as
soon
as
practicable
and
there
was
a
growing
fund
therefor
on
christmas
morning
nevertheless
in
addition
to
a
generous
addition
to
the
fund
juliet
found
beside
her
plate
an
exceedingly
personal
gift
in
the
shape
of
a
little
brooch
of
rare
design
bearing
the
stamp
of
a
superior
maker
must
i
scold
you
she
asked
smiling
up
at
him
as
he
stood
beside
her
watching
her
face
flush
with
pleasure
kiss
me
instead
he
answered
promptly
and
do
expect
me
to
give
up
making
you
now
and
then
a
real
present
even
though
it
has
to
be
a
small
one
it
too
much
fun
beside
his
own
plate
he
found
her
gift
a
set
of
histories
he
had
long
wanted
it
was
a
beautiful
edition
and
he
would
have
looked
reproachfully
at
the
giver
if
she
had
not
forestalled
him
by
running
around
the
table
to
say
softly
in
his
ear
both
arms
about
his
neck
just
at
christmas
time
dearest
let
me
have
my
way
the
day
was
a
happy
one
horatio
marcy
and
dingley
arrived
on
the
morning
train
and
stayed
until
evening
at
the
christmas
dinner
judith
and
wayne
carey
and
roger
barnes
were
the
additional
guests
and
mary
mckaim
was
in
the
kitchen
dinner
over
everybody
sat
about
the
fireplace
talking
when
juliet
came
in
to
carry
little
tony
off
to
bed
five
minutes
more
begged
barnes
on
whose
knee
the
child
sat
a
willing
captive
to
the
arts
of
his
entertainer
his
eyes
bright
with
the
excitement
of
this
great
day
were
fixed
upon
the
doctor
face
and
so
barnes
continued
the
story
he
had
begun
the
rooster
climbed
right
up
the
man
leg
the
toy
obeyed
his
command
and
scaled
the
eminence
from
the
floor
where
it
had
been
hiding
behind
a
noah
ark
and
perched
on
his
knee
and
cried
the
rooster
crowed
lustily
and
little
tony
laughed
ecstatically
then
the
rooster
flew
up
on
the
man
shoulder
and
flapped
his
wings
and
all
at
once
he
fell
right
over
backwards
and
tumbled
on
his
head
on
the
got
to
go
to
bed
tony
shall
the
rooster
go
too
all
right
may
i
carry
him
up
for
you
juliet
deep
in
that
discussion
get
on
my
back
old
man
that
the
way
everybody
looked
after
the
two
as
the
doctor
mounted
the
stairs
that
rooster
has
captivated
the
child
more
than
all
the
mechanical
toys
he
has
had
said
dingley
what
a
handsome
fellow
he
is
said
carey
his
eyes
following
little
tony
till
he
disappeared
i
never
saw
a
healthier
happier
child
how
sturdy
he
is
on
his
legs
have
you
noticed
he
saying
a
good
many
words
too
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
see
him
imitate
that
rooster
juliet
father
and
dingley
left
on
an
early
evening
train
and
only
the
three
younger
guests
remained
when
juliet
came
downstairs
after
putting
her
boy
to
bed
she
set
about
gathering
up
the
toys
scattered
over
the
floor
and
barnes
helped
her
in
the
midst
of
this
labour
during
which
they
all
made
merry
with
some
of
the
more
elaborate
mechanical
affairs
juliet
suddenly
said
what
that
and
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
let
me
go
offered
anthony
he
probably
too
excited
to
get
to
sleep
easily
after
all
this
hullo
he
crowing
with
the
rooster
yet
but
juliet
went
up
and
he
followed
her
saying
from
the
landing
to
his
guests
excuse
me
for
a
little
i
get
the
boy
quiet
and
let
his
mother
come
down
i
a
fine
talent
for
that
sort
of
thing
that
rooster
will
have
to
be
given
some
soothing
syrup
he
too
lively
a
fowl
i
never
saw
a
man
fonder
of
his
youngster
than
tony
carey
observed
the
child
is
a
particularly
fine
specimen
the
doctor
said
i
think
i
never
saw
a
more
ideal
development
than
he
shows
he
began
to
tell
an
incident
in
which
little
tony
had
been
involved
when
he
was
interrupted
barnes
called
anthony
voice
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
come
up
here
please
there
was
something
in
the
imperative
quality
of
this
summons
which
made
the
doctor
run
up
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
judith
and
wayne
listened
the
rooster
could
still
be
heard
crowing
faintly
but
distinctly
perhaps
he
grown
too
excited
over
it
judith
suggested
they
ought
to
take
it
away
carey
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
listened
there
were
rapid
movements
overhead
the
doctor
voice
could
be
heard
giving
directions
through
which
sounded
the
steady
crowing
of
the
toy
hold
him
so
now
move
him
that
way
as
i
thump
now
the
other
carey
turned
pale
he
got
that
rooster
in
his
throat
he
said
solemnly
the
rooster
was
nearly
but
the
incongruity
of
this
suggestion
did
not
strike
him
judith
hastily
rose
from
her
chair
and
went
to
him
had
we
better
go
up
he
whispered
heavens
no
judith
clutched
his
arm
we
could
do
any
good
the
doctor
there
such
things
make
me
ill
they
ought
not
to
have
let
him
have
the
toy
to
take
to
bed
with
him
how
could
it
get
into
his
throat
perhaps
they
are
making
it
crow
to
divert
him
perhaps
he
hurt
himself
somehow
he
got
the
crow
part
of
that
thing
in
his
throat
carey
persisted
in
an
anxious
whisper
the
manufacturers
ought
to
be
prosecuted
for
making
a
toy
that
will
come
apart
like
that
do
stand
there
protested
his
wife
maybe
it
nothing
come
here
and
sit
down
but
carey
stood
still
presently
anthony
came
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
wayne
said
he
rapidly
telephone
roger
office
ask
the
trained
nurse
miss
hughes
to
send
a
messenger
with
the
doctor
emergency
surgical
case
by
the
first
train
he
can
catch
the
if
he
quick
tell
miss
hughes
to
follow
as
soon
as
she
can
get
ready
prepared
to
stay
all
night
then
he
disappeared
his
voice
had
been
steady
and
quiet
but
his
eyes
had
showed
his
friend
that
the
order
was
given
under
tension
carey
sprang
to
the
telephone
and
his
hand
shook
as
he
took
down
the
receiver
upstairs
roger
barnes
in
command
was
giving
cool
concise
orders
his
eyes
on
his
little
patient
when
he
had
despatched
juliet
for
various
things
including
boiling
water
which
she
must
get
downstairs
he
said
to
anthony
in
a
conversational
tone
it
will
probably
not
be
safe
to
wait
till
my
instruments
get
here
and
there
no
surgeon
near
enough
to
call
i
not
going
to
take
any
chances
on
this
boy
if
i
see
the
necessity
i
going
to
get
into
that
throat
and
give
him
air
i
shall
want
you
and
carey
to
hold
him
juliet
must
be
downstairs
anthony
nodded
he
did
not
quite
understand
but
a
few
minutes
later
when
juliet
had
brought
the
boiling
water
he
suddenly
perceived
what
his
friend
meant
alcohol
now
please
said
the
doctor
when
juliet
had
disappeared
again
barnes
drew
from
his
pocket
a
and
tried
its
blades
it
a
fortunate
thing
somebody
made
me
a
present
of
such
a
good
one
he
observed
but
it
needs
sharpening
a
bit
have
you
an
handy
with
tightly
shut
lips
anthony
watched
the
doctor
put
a
bright
edge
on
his
smallest
blade
then
satisfied
drop
the
open
knife
into
the
water
bubbling
over
a
anthony
turned
his
head
away
for
an
instant
from
the
struggling
little
figure
on
the
bed
barnes
eyed
him
keenly
you
game
of
course
he
said
anthony
eyes
met
his
and
flashed
fire
do
you
know
me
better
than
that
all
right
and
the
young
surgeon
smiled
but
i
seen
a
medical
man
himself
go
to
pieces
over
his
own
child
this
is
a
simple
matter
he
went
on
lightly
luckily
boiling
water
is
a
more
potent
antiseptic
than
all
the
drugs
on
the
market
and
alcohol
another
i
shall
want
a
new
hairpin
or
two
if
juliet
has
a
wire
that
the
alcohol
thank
you
now
if
you
the
hairpins
juliet
ah
a
silver
one
all
the
better
this
also
he
dropped
into
the
boiling
water
then
he
spoke
very
quietly
to
tony
mother
as
she
bent
over
her
child
fighting
for
his
breath
it
a
bit
tough
to
watch
he
said
but
we
have
him
all
right
presently
suppose
you
go
and
get
his
crib
ready
for
him
you
might
fill
some
bags
and
bottles
and
have
things
warm
and
comfortable
the
rang
below
after
a
minute
carey
dashed
upstairs
he
looked
into
the
room
and
spoke
anxiously
the
messenger
just
missed
the
he
and
the
nurse
will
come
on
the
all
right
said
the
doctor
as
if
the
delay
were
of
small
consequence
we
going
to
want
your
help
presently
carey
i
think
just
ask
carey
to
keep
robeson
with
her
for
a
few
minutes
if
she
can
carey
went
down
and
gave
his
wife
the
message
then
he
hurried
back
and
stood
waiting
just
outside
the
door
and
all
at
once
the
summons
came
in
a
breath
the
doctor
had
changed
his
rôle
he
spoke
sharply
robeson
now
carey
we
waited
up
to
the
limit
keep
cool
hold
him
like
a
rock
wayne
carey
came
down
to
his
wife
ten
minutes
later
smiled
tremulously
sank
into
a
chair
and
fell
to
crying
like
a
baby
softly
so
that
he
could
not
be
heard
but
juliet
says
he
be
all
right
murmured
judith
unsteadily
yes
yes
carey
wiped
his
eyes
and
blew
his
nose
i
just
a
little
unnerved
that
all
lord
and
he
dropped
off
to
sleep
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
with
barnes
holding
the
gash
in
his
throat
open
with
a
hairpin
to
let
the
air
in
when
it
comes
to
emergency
surgery
i
tell
you
it
a
lucky
thing
to
have
an
expert
in
the
house
completely
worn
out
the
little
chap
when
the
nurse
comes
they
get
out
the
whistle
and
sew
the
place
up
she
ought
to
be
here
i
go
meet
that
train
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
hurried
out
of
the
house
presently
he
was
back
followed
by
an
erect
young
woman
who
wore
a
long
coat
over
the
uniform
she
had
not
taken
time
to
change
carey
carried
the
long
black
bag
she
had
brought
with
her
by
and
by
anthony
and
roger
barnes
came
down
the
former
was
pale
but
as
quietly
composed
as
ever
the
latter
nonchalant
yet
wearing
that
gleam
of
satisfaction
in
his
eye
which
is
ever
the
badge
of
the
successful
surgeon
well
carey
said
the
doctor
smiling
why
not
relax
that
tension
a
bit
the
youngster
is
right
as
a
trivet
i
suppose
that
your
idea
of
being
right
as
a
trivet
judith
retorted
in
bed
with
a
trained
nurse
watching
you
and
a
doctor
staying
all
night
to
make
sure
bless
you
what
better
would
you
have
if
it
were
any
other
boy
the
doctor
would
have
been
home
and
in
bed
an
hour
ago
i
assure
you
carey
if
you
do
stop
acting
like
a
great
fool
i
put
you
to
bed
too
for
carey
was
wringing
barnes
hand
and
the
tears
were
running
unashamed
down
his
cheeks
i
gave
him
that
rooster
myself
he
said
and
choked
upstairs
all
was
quiet
the
little
life
was
safe
rescued
at
the
crucial
moment
when
interference
became
necessary
by
the
skill
and
daring
which
do
not
hesitate
to
use
the
means
at
hand
when
the
authorized
tools
can
not
be
had
every
precaution
had
been
taken
against
harm
from
these
same
unconventional
means
and
the
doctor
when
he
left
his
patient
in
the
hands
of
his
nurse
felt
small
anxiety
for
the
ultimate
outcome
he
said
this
very
positively
to
the
boy
father
and
mother
holding
a
hand
of
each
and
bidding
them
go
peacefully
to
sleep
he
would
have
slipped
away
then
but
they
would
not
let
him
go
there
were
no
tears
no
fuss
but
juliet
said
her
eyes
with
their
heavy
shadows
of
past
suspense
meeting
his
steadily
roger
nothing
can
ever
tell
you
what
i
feel
about
this
and
anthony
gripping
his
friend
hand
with
a
grip
of
steel
added
we
shall
never
thank
the
lord
enough
for
having
you
on
hand
roger
barnes
but
when
the
young
surgeon
had
gone
warm
with
pleasure
over
the
service
he
had
done
those
he
loved
this
night
the
ones
he
had
left
behind
found
their
had
reached
the
ragged
edge
turning
to
her
husband
juliet
flung
herself
into
his
arms
and
met
there
the
tenderest
reception
she
had
ever
known
so
does
a
common
anxiety
knit
hearts
which
had
thought
they
could
be
no
tighter
bound
judith
and
wayne
carey
walking
along
silent
streets
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
day
after
christmas
on
their
way
to
take
their
train
home
had
little
to
say
only
once
judith
ventured
an
observation
to
her
companion
surely
such
a
scene
as
you
went
through
last
night
must
diminish
a
trifle
that
envy
you
are
always
possessed
with
when
you
at
that
house
but
wayne
staring
up
at
the
wintry
sky
answered
more
roughly
than
his
wife
had
ever
heard
him
speak
god
knows
i
envy
them
even
at
a
time
like
this
two
not
of
a
kind
yes
they
are
very
pleasant
rooms
juliet
admitted
with
the
air
of
one
endeavouring
to
be
polite
she
sat
upon
a
divan
and
glanced
from
the
to
the
green
velvet
chairs
the
carpet
and
the
stiff
lace
curtains
you
get
the
afternoon
sun
and
the
view
opposite
is
bad
the
vestibule
seemed
to
be
well
kept
and
i
rang
only
three
times
before
i
made
you
hear
the
janitor
promised
to
fix
that
bell
said
judith
hastily
oh
i
know
the
colour
combinations
are
dreadful
but
one
ca
help
that
in
rented
rooms
of
course
our
things
look
badly
with
the
ones
that
belong
here
but
as
soon
as
we
can
we
are
going
to
move
into
a
still
better
place
going
to
keep
house
not
just
yet
judith
hesitated
you
seem
to
think
there
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
but
to
keep
house
i
sure
of
it
i
ca
see
why
a
girl
does
need
to
assume
all
the
cares
of
life
the
minute
she
marries
why
ca
she
keep
young
and
fresh
for
a
while
juliet
glanced
toward
a
mirror
opposite
how
old
and
haggard
i
must
be
looking
she
observed
with
it
must
be
confessed
a
touch
of
complacency
the
woman
who
could
have
seen
that
image
reflected
as
her
own
without
complacency
must
have
been
indifferent
indeed
of
course
you
manage
it
somehow
i
suppose
because
anthony
takes
such
care
of
you
but
you
wait
till
five
years
more
have
gone
over
your
head
and
see
if
you
not
tired
of
it
if
i
as
tired
of
it
as
you
are
began
juliet
and
stopped
but
seriously
judith
is
it
nothing
to
you
to
please
wayne
why
of
course
judith
flushed
but
wayne
is
satisfied
are
you
sure
of
it
certainly
oh
sometimes
when
we
go
to
see
you
and
you
make
things
so
pleasant
with
your
big
fire
and
your
good
things
to
eat
he
gets
a
spasm
of
wishing
we
were
by
ourselves
but
juliet
shook
her
head
wayne
does
say
a
word
she
said
and
he
as
devoted
to
you
as
a
man
can
be
but
judith
if
i
know
the
symptoms
that
husband
of
yours
is
starving
for
a
home
and
do
i
dare
say
it
judith
was
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
ugly
walls
opposite
it
was
her
bedroom
window
and
the
opposite
walls
were
not
six
feet
away
i
suppose
you
dare
say
anything
she
answered
looking
as
if
she
were
about
to
cry
i
sure
i
envy
you
you
so
supremely
contented
i
think
i
was
made
to
care
for
children
that
might
come
said
juliet
softly
i
sure
it
would
judith
as
for
wayne
if
you
could
see
the
look
on
his
face
i
surprised
there
more
than
once
when
he
had
little
anthony
and
he
thought
nobody
noticed
it
would
make
your
heart
ache
dear
do
deny
him
or
yourself
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
either
of
you
at
least
do
deny
it
for
lack
of
a
home
i
sure
i
ca
imagine
tony
junior
in
these
rooms
of
yours
they
do
look
she
explained
smiling
exactly
babyish
she
rose
to
go
she
looked
so
young
and
fair
and
sweet
as
she
spoke
her
gentle
homily
that
judith
half
doubting
half
believing
admitted
to
herself
that
of
one
thing
there
could
be
no
question
anthony
robeson
envied
nobody
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
the
visits
of
the
robesons
to
the
various
apartments
which
were
in
rotation
occupied
by
the
careys
were
few
somehow
it
seemed
much
easier
and
simpler
for
the
pair
who
had
no
children
and
no
housekeeping
to
hamper
them
to
run
out
into
the
suburbs
than
for
their
friends
to
get
into
town
so
the
careys
came
with
ever
increasing
frequency
always
warmly
welcomed
and
enjoyed
the
hours
within
the
little
house
so
thoroughly
that
in
time
the
influence
of
the
content
they
saw
so
often
began
to
have
its
inevitable
effect
i
great
news
for
you
said
anthony
coming
home
one
march
day
when
little
tony
was
nearing
his
second
birthday
it
about
the
careys
guess
they
are
going
to
housekeeping
how
did
you
know
i
did
know
but
judith
told
me
weeks
ago
she
supposed
she
should
have
to
come
to
it
have
they
found
a
house
carey
thinks
he
has
judith
does
like
the
place
for
about
fifty
good
and
sufficient
reasons
to
her
he
trying
to
persuade
her
he
has
an
option
on
it
for
ten
days
he
wants
us
to
come
out
and
look
at
it
with
them
where
is
it
about
as
far
east
of
the
city
as
we
are
north
if
is
a
good
day
i
promised
we
would
run
out
with
them
on
the
i
suspect
they
need
us
badly
wayne
looks
like
a
man
distracted
the
great
trouble
i
fancy
is
going
to
be
that
judith
dearborn
carey
is
still
too
much
of
a
dearborn
to
be
able
to
make
a
home
out
of
anything
and
carey
ca
do
it
alone
indeed
he
ca
poor
fellow
i
never
saw
a
man
in
my
life
who
wanted
a
home
as
badly
as
wayne
does
let
do
our
best
to
help
them
we
will
but
the
only
way
to
do
it
thoroughly
is
to
make
judith
over
even
you
ca
accomplish
that
there
hope
if
she
has
agreed
at
all
to
trying
the
experiment
juliet
declared
and
thought
about
her
friends
all
the
rest
of
the
day
it
was
but
five
minutes
walk
from
the
suburban
station
where
the
party
got
off
next
morning
to
the
house
which
carey
eagerly
pointed
out
as
the
four
approached
there
it
is
he
said
do
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
till
seen
the
whole
thing
i
know
it
does
look
promising
as
yet
but
i
keep
remembering
the
photographs
of
your
home
robeson
before
you
went
at
it
i
inclined
to
think
this
can
be
made
right
too
anthony
and
juliet
studied
carey
choice
with
interest
judith
looked
on
dubiously
it
was
plain
that
if
she
should
consent
it
would
be
against
her
will
it
looks
so
commonplace
and
ugly
she
said
aside
to
juliet
as
the
four
completed
the
tour
around
the
house
and
prepared
to
enter
your
home
is
enough
to
be
interesting
but
this
is
just
modern
enough
to
be
ugly
look
at
that
big
window
in
front
with
the
cheap
coloured
glass
across
the
top
what
could
you
do
with
that
several
things
said
her
friend
promptly
you
might
put
in
a
row
of
narrow
casement
windows
across
the
front
with
diamond
panes
no
the
porch
is
attractive
with
all
that
gingerbread
work
but
you
could
take
it
away
and
have
something
plain
and
simple
the
general
lines
of
the
house
are
not
bad
it
has
been
an
house
judith
but
somebody
who
did
know
how
has
altered
it
and
spoiled
it
people
are
always
doing
that
there
must
have
been
a
fanlight
over
this
door
you
could
restore
it
and
do
you
see
that
quaint
round
window
in
the
gable
probably
they
looked
at
that
and
longed
to
do
away
with
it
but
happily
for
you
did
know
how
carey
glanced
curiously
at
his
friend
wife
then
anxiously
at
his
own
juliet
face
was
alight
with
interest
judith
heavy
with
dissatisfaction
he
wondered
for
the
thousandth
time
what
made
the
difference
he
would
have
given
a
year
salary
to
see
judith
look
interested
in
this
desire
of
his
heart
it
was
hard
to
push
a
thing
like
this
against
the
will
of
the
only
person
whose
help
he
could
not
do
without
carey
was
determined
to
have
the
home
even
judith
acknowledged
that
she
had
not
been
happy
in
any
of
the
seven
apartments
they
had
tried
during
the
less
than
four
years
of
their
married
life
carey
believed
with
all
his
heart
that
their
only
chance
for
happiness
lay
in
getting
away
from
a
manner
of
living
which
was
using
up
every
penny
he
could
earn
without
giving
them
either
satisfaction
or
comfort
his
salary
would
not
permit
him
to
rent
the
sort
of
thing
in
the
sort
of
neighbourhood
which
judith
longed
for
and
if
it
should
he
did
not
believe
his
wife
would
find
such
environments
any
more
congenial
than
the
present
one
carey
had
a
theory
that
a
woman
like
a
man
must
be
busy
to
be
contented
he
meant
to
try
it
with
his
handsome
discontented
wife
oh
what
a
pretty
hall
cried
robeson
with
enthusiasm
how
lucky
that
the
vandals
who
made
the
house
over
did
lay
their
desecrating
hands
on
that
staircase
the
hall
looks
gloomy
to
me
said
carey
with
a
disapproving
glance
at
the
walls
of
course
with
that
dingy
brown
paper
and
the
woodwork
stained
that
hideous
imitation
of
oak
you
can
scrape
all
that
off
paint
it
white
put
on
a
warm
rich
paper
restore
your
fanlight
and
you
have
a
particularly
attractive
hall
i
wish
i
could
see
things
that
are
not
visible
as
you
seem
to
be
able
to
sighed
judith
looking
unconvinced
i
never
did
like
a
long
straight
staircase
like
that
and
there
not
room
to
make
a
turn
you
do
want
to
do
you
it
so
wide
and
low
it
does
need
to
turn
and
the
posts
and
rails
are
extremely
good
how
about
this
front
room
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
front
room
and
the
two
men
watching
her
vivid
face
as
it
glowed
above
her
furs
noting
the
capable
womanly
way
she
had
of
looking
at
the
best
side
of
everything
and
discerning
in
a
flash
of
imagination
and
intuition
what
could
be
done
with
unpromising
material
appreciated
her
with
that
full
masculine
appreciation
which
it
is
so
well
worth
the
trouble
of
any
woman
to
win
judith
was
not
blind
she
saw
little
by
little
as
juliet
went
from
room
to
room
seizing
in
each
upon
its
possibilities
ignoring
its
poorer
features
except
to
suggest
their
betterment
giving
her
friendly
counsel
in
a
way
which
continually
took
the
prospective
homemakers
into
consideration
that
she
herself
was
losing
something
immeasurably
valuable
in
not
attempting
to
cultivate
these
same
winning
characteristics
and
in
the
same
breath
judith
was
forced
to
admit
to
herself
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
begin
there
is
really
a
very
pretty
view
from
the
she
said
as
a
first
effort
at
seeing
something
to
admire
both
juliet
and
anthony
agreed
to
this
statement
with
a
cordiality
which
came
very
near
suggesting
that
it
was
a
relief
to
find
carey
on
the
optimistic
side
of
the
discussion
even
in
this
small
detail
as
for
carey
he
looked
so
surprised
and
grateful
that
judith
heart
smote
her
with
a
vigour
to
which
she
was
unaccustomed
i
suppose
you
could
use
this
room
as
a
sort
of
den
she
was
prompted
to
suggest
to
her
husband
and
such
a
delighted
smile
illumined
carey
face
that
the
sight
of
it
was
almost
pathetic
to
his
friends
who
understood
his
situation
rather
better
than
he
did
himself
in
his
pleasure
carey
put
his
arm
about
his
wife
shoulders
could
i
though
he
agreed
enthusiastically
and
you
could
use
it
for
a
retreat
while
i
was
away
for
the
day
a
retreat
from
what
too
much
excitement
began
judith
the
old
habit
of
scorn
of
everything
which
was
not
of
the
city
returning
upon
her
irresistibly
but
it
chanced
that
she
caught
juliet
eyes
unconsciously
wearing
such
an
expression
of
solicitude
to
see
her
friend
complaisant
in
this
matter
which
meant
so
much
that
judith
hurriedly
followed
her
ironic
question
with
the
more
kindly
supplement
but
doubtless
i
should
have
plenty
and
be
glad
to
get
away
you
certainly
would
asserted
anthony
we
never
guessed
how
much
there
would
be
to
occupy
us
in
the
country
but
there
seems
hardly
time
to
write
letters
nobody
can
believe
till
he
tries
how
much
pleasure
there
is
in
wheedling
a
garden
into
growing
nor
how
well
the
labour
makes
him
sleep
o
nights
yes
i
think
i
could
sleep
here
said
carey
and
passed
a
hand
over
a
brow
which
was
aching
at
that
very
moment
i
have
done
that
satisfactorily
for
six
months
you
do
it
here
anthony
prophesied
confidently
it
a
fine
air
with
a
good
breath
of
the
salt
sea
in
it
which
we
do
get
your
sleeping
rooms
are
all
well
aired
and
lighted
a
thing
you
do
always
find
in
more
pretentious
houses
and
when
the
paint
and
paper
go
on
you
own
yourselves
surprised
at
the
transformation
i
was
never
so
astonished
in
my
life
as
i
was
at
the
change
in
the
little
bedroom
in
our
house
which
has
that
pale
stripe
on
the
wall
it
was
a
north
room
and
the
old
wall
was
a
forlorn
slate
like
a
thundercloud
my
little
artist
here
with
her
eye
for
colours
instantly
announced
that
she
would
get
the
sunshine
into
that
room
and
so
she
did
with
no
more
potent
a
charm
than
that
paper
and
a
fresh
coat
of
white
paint
carey
looked
at
juliet
with
longing
in
his
eye
he
wanted
to
ask
her
to
supervise
the
alterations
in
his
purchase
if
he
should
make
it
but
he
remembered
other
occasions
when
he
had
held
the
sayings
and
doings
of
robeson
before
the
eyes
of
carey
with
disastrous
result
and
he
dared
not
make
the
suggestion
he
hoped
however
that
judith
might
be
inclined
to
ask
the
assistance
of
her
friend
and
himself
hinted
at
it
cautiously
but
judith
beyond
inquiring
what
juliet
thought
of
certain
possible
changes
seemed
inclined
to
shoulder
her
own
responsibilities
anthony
left
his
wife
upon
the
train
to
return
to
his
work
the
careys
accompanied
him
so
that
he
had
no
chance
to
talk
things
over
until
he
came
home
to
dinner
at
night
but
when
he
saw
juliet
again
almost
her
first
words
showed
him
where
her
thoughts
were
tony
i
ca
get
those
people
off
my
mind
do
you
suppose
they
will
ever
make
a
home
out
of
anything
they
have
much
genius
for
utilizing
raw
material
i
very
much
afraid
anthony
responded
thoughtfully
carey
has
the
will
and
he
can
furnish
a
moderate
amount
of
funds
but
whether
judith
can
furnish
anything
but
objections
and
contrariety
i
do
dare
to
predict
if
her
heart
were
in
it
i
should
have
more
hope
of
her
there
one
thing
i
can
tell
her
if
she
does
set
her
soul
to
the
giving
the
old
boy
a
taste
of
peace
and
rest
she
have
him
worn
out
before
his
time
a
fellow
who
does
know
how
it
feels
to
sleep
soundly
and
whose
head
bothers
him
half
the
time
needs
looking
after
he
a
slave
to
his
office
desk
and
needs
far
more
than
an
active
chap
like
me
to
get
out
of
the
city
as
much
as
he
can
yes
he
worried
and
restless
tony
he
so
devoted
to
judith
and
so
anxious
to
make
her
happy
her
dissatisfaction
rests
on
him
like
a
weight
do
you
see
that
every
time
you
see
them
together
every
time
and
more
plainly
what
the
matter
with
her
anyhow
julie
she
seemed
promising
enough
as
a
girl
you
certainly
found
enough
in
her
to
make
you
two
congenial
she
no
more
like
you
than
electric
light
is
like
sunshine
said
anthony
picking
up
the
simile
with
a
laugh
and
a
glance
of
appreciation
judith
shines
in
the
surroundings
she
was
born
and
brought
up
in
misses
them
and
does
know
how
to
adapt
herself
to
any
others
she
ought
to
have
been
the
wife
of
some
high
official
she
could
entertain
royally
and
have
everybody
at
her
feet
magnificent
characteristics
but
mighty
unavailable
in
the
present
circumstances
it
carries
out
my
comparison
i
prefer
the
sunlight
and
i
have
poor
carey
we
hope
said
juliet
and
if
we
have
the
smallest
chance
to
help
we
do
it
but
as
anthony
had
anticipated
there
was
small
chance
to
help
meeting
carey
a
fortnight
later
anthony
inquired
after
the
new
home
and
carey
replied
with
apparent
lack
of
enthusiasm
that
the
house
had
been
leased
for
a
term
of
three
years
with
refusal
of
the
purchase
at
the
expiration
of
the
time
he
explained
that
judith
had
been
unwilling
to
burn
her
bridges
by
buying
the
place
outright
and
that
he
thought
perhaps
the
present
plan
was
the
better
one
under
these
conditions
but
the
fact
that
the
house
was
not
their
own
made
it
seem
unwise
to
expend
very
much
upon
alterations
beyond
those
of
paint
and
paper
with
the
prospect
of
a
sale
the
owner
had
unwillingly
consented
to
replace
the
gingerbread
porch
with
one
in
better
style
but
refused
to
do
more
the
big
window
with
its
abominable
topping
of
cheap
coloured
glass
was
to
remain
for
the
present
and
i
think
this
whole
arrangement
is
bound
to
defeat
my
purpose
said
carey
unhappily
the
very
changes
we
ca
afford
to
make
in
a
rented
house
are
the
ones
judith
needs
to
have
made
to
reconcile
her
to
the
experiment
she
says
she
feels
ill
every
time
she
comes
to
the
house
and
sees
that
window
she
wants
a
porcelain
sink
in
the
kitchen
she
would
like
and
a
system
of
electric
bells
we
to
have
a
servant
if
we
can
find
her
we
put
green
paper
on
all
the
downstairs
rooms
and
it
turns
out
the
wrong
green
i
wanted
a
sort
of
that
looked
more
cheerful
but
it
seems
green
is
the
only
thing
i
know
what
the
matter
with
me
perhaps
i
bilious
green
seems
to
be
all
right
in
your
house
but
in
mine
it
makes
me
want
to
go
outdoors
that
precisely
what
you
should
do
anthony
advised
cheerfully
get
outdoors
all
you
can
start
your
garden
mow
your
lawn
yourself
make
over
that
gravel
path
to
your
front
door
i
only
evenings
objected
carey
and
we
not
settled
yet
the
paper
only
just
on
we
have
moved
we
buying
furniture
we
bought
a
sideboard
yesterday
it
cost
so
much
we
had
to
get
a
cheaper
range
for
the
kitchen
than
seemed
desirable
but
judith
liked
the
sideboard
so
well
i
was
glad
to
buy
it
i
do
know
when
we
shall
get
to
living
there
permanently
this
furnishing
business
knocks
me
out
we
do
seem
to
know
what
we
want
i
like
he
hesitated
i
hoped
robeson
might
be
able
to
give
us
the
advantage
of
her
experience
but
it
turns
out
that
judith
has
a
sort
of
pride
in
doing
it
herself
and
of
course
i
presume
you
made
some
mistakes
yourselves
eh
he
suggested
this
with
eagerness
oh
of
course
agreed
anthony
readily
though
he
wondered
what
they
were
and
inwardly
begged
juliet
pardon
for
this
answer
given
out
of
masculine
sympathy
with
his
friend
helplessness
you
come
out
all
right
he
hastily
assured
carey
once
you
are
living
in
the
new
place
things
will
adjust
themselves
keep
up
your
courage
your
daily
walk
to
and
from
the
train
will
do
wonders
lack
of
exercise
will
make
a
rainbow
look
gloomy
to
a
fellow
i
think
you
great
cause
for
rejoicing
that
judith
has
agreed
to
try
the
experiment
at
all
and
as
with
all
experiments
you
must
be
patient
while
it
works
itself
out
that
so
agreed
carey
a
gleam
of
hope
in
his
eyes
and
anthony
got
away
but
by
himself
the
happier
man
shook
his
head
doubtfully
where
everything
depends
on
the
woman
he
said
to
himself
and
you
married
one
that
her
maker
never
fashioned
for
domestic
joys
you
certainly
up
against
a
mighty
difficult
proposition
the
careys
are
at
home
wayne
and
judith
carey
had
been
keeping
house
for
two
months
before
judith
was
willing
to
accede
to
her
husband
often
repeated
request
that
they
entertain
the
robesons
we
been
there
together
and
separately
till
it
a
wonder
their
hospitality
does
freeze
up
he
urged
let
have
them
out
night
and
keep
them
over
till
next
day
at
least
i
like
to
have
them
sleep
under
this
roof
they
bring
us
good
luck
one
would
think
the
robesons
were
the
only
people
worth
knowing
said
judith
with
a
petulance
of
which
she
had
the
grace
as
her
husband
stared
at
her
to
be
ashamed
they
the
truest
friends
we
have
in
the
world
he
said
with
a
dignity
of
manner
unusual
with
him
sometimes
i
think
they
are
the
only
people
worth
knowing
out
of
all
those
on
your
calling
list
we
differ
about
that
your
ideas
of
who
are
worth
knowing
are
very
peculiar
heaven
knows
i
fond
of
juliet
but
i
get
decidedly
tired
of
having
her
held
up
as
a
model
and
i
have
been
anxious
to
entertain
her
until
we
were
in
order
we
certainly
as
much
in
order
now
as
we
shall
be
for
some
time
have
them
out
you
find
they
see
everything
there
is
to
praise
their
way
so
anthony
and
juliet
were
asked
and
came
wayne
prophecy
was
proven
a
true
one
even
judith
grew
complacent
as
her
friends
admired
the
result
of
her
and
in
truth
there
was
much
to
admire
judith
was
a
young
woman
of
taste
and
more
or
less
discretion
and
if
she
could
have
had
full
sway
in
her
purchasing
the
result
might
have
been
admirable
as
it
was
the
unspoken
criticism
in
the
minds
of
both
the
guests
as
they
followed
their
hosts
about
the
house
was
that
judith
had
struck
a
in
her
construction
of
a
home
a
little
too
ambitious
to
be
wholly
satisfactory
i
believe
in
buying
the
best
of
everything
as
far
as
you
go
she
said
indicating
a
particularly
costly
lounging
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
of
course
that
was
very
expensive
but
it
will
always
be
right
and
we
can
get
others
to
go
with
it
the
bookcases
were
another
purchase
but
they
give
an
air
to
the
room
worth
paying
for
i
only
one
objection
to
this
room
said
wayne
with
some
hesitation
as
judith
says
the
things
in
it
seem
to
be
all
right
and
it
certainly
looks
in
good
taste
if
i
any
judge
but
i
do
know
just
how
to
explain
it
he
hesitated
again
and
smiled
deprecatingly
at
his
wife
speak
out
said
judith
she
was
in
a
very
good
humour
for
her
guests
had
shown
so
fine
a
tact
in
their
commendation
that
she
was
in
quite
a
glow
of
satisfaction
and
for
the
first
time
felt
the
pleasure
of
the
hostess
in
an
attractive
home
it
ca
be
a
serious
objection
for
you
liked
every
single
thing
we
put
into
it
indeed
i
have
agreed
carey
eagerly
glancing
about
the
brilliantly
lit
room
i
like
it
all
awfully
well
especially
in
the
daylight
the
corner
by
the
window
is
a
famous
place
for
reading
but
you
see
i
so
little
here
in
the
daytime
except
on
sundays
of
course
i
know
we
lack
the
fireplace
that
makes
your
jolly
but
it
seems
as
if
we
lack
something
besides
that
we
might
have
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
tell
what
it
is
anthony
knew
by
a
certain
curve
in
the
corner
of
his
wife
mouth
that
she
longed
to
tell
him
what
it
was
for
himself
he
could
not
discover
he
studied
the
room
searchingly
and
was
unable
to
determine
why
attractive
as
it
really
was
it
certainly
did
upon
this
cool
may
evening
lack
the
look
of
warm
comfort
and
hospitality
of
which
his
own
home
was
so
full
possibly
it
because
everything
is
so
new
he
ventured
rooms
come
to
have
a
look
of
home
you
know
just
by
living
in
them
and
leaving
things
about
it
a
pretty
room
all
right
and
i
fancy
it
will
take
on
the
friendly
expression
you
want
when
you
get
to
strewing
your
books
and
magazines
around
a
little
more
and
laying
your
pipe
down
on
the
corner
of
the
you
know
and
all
that
i
can
upset
things
for
you
in
half
a
minute
if
you
give
me
leave
you
have
my
full
permission
said
judith
laughing
i
fancy
it
just
as
you
say
wayne
is
used
to
it
yet
he
always
likes
his
old
slippers
better
than
the
handsomest
new
ones
i
can
buy
him
come
dinner
has
been
served
for
five
minutes
no
more
artistic
suggestions
till
afterward
the
dinner
was
perfect
it
should
have
been
so
for
a
caterer
was
in
the
kitchen
and
a
hired
waitress
served
the
viands
without
disaster
as
a
delectable
meal
it
was
a
success
as
an
exhibition
of
capacity
for
home
making
it
was
something
of
a
failure
it
certainly
did
not
for
a
moment
deceive
the
guests
for
the
life
of
her
as
juliet
tasted
course
after
course
of
the
elaborate
meal
she
could
not
help
reckoning
up
what
it
had
cost
neither
could
she
refrain
from
wondering
what
sort
of
a
repast
judith
would
have
produced
without
help
after
dinner
as
wayne
and
anthony
smoked
in
front
of
the
fireless
in
the
den
each
in
a
more
luxurious
chair
than
was
to
be
found
in
anthony
whole
house
judith
took
juliet
to
task
you
may
try
to
disguise
it
she
complained
but
i
known
you
too
long
not
to
be
able
to
read
you
you
would
rather
have
had
me
cook
that
dinner
myself
and
bring
it
in
all
red
and
blistered
from
being
over
the
stove
as
long
as
the
dinner
was
red
and
blistered
you
would
have
been
unhappy
juliet
returned
lightly
but
you
must
think
that
she
who
entertains
may
read
my
ingenuous
face
my
dear
it
is
necessary
that
i
attempt
to
convert
the
world
to
my
way
of
thinking
and
i
have
told
you
that
when
auntie
dingley
goes
abroad
with
father
again
this
winter
i
to
have
mary
mckaim
for
eight
whole
months
i
can
assure
you
i
know
how
to
appreciate
the
comfort
of
having
a
competent
cook
in
the
kitchen
she
got
up
and
crossed
the
room
judith
what
an
exquisite
lamp
she
observed
i
forgotten
that
you
had
it
was
it
one
of
your
wedding
presents
judith
followed
her
to
where
she
stood
examining
an
imposing
lamp
with
jeweled
inlets
in
the
metal
shade
yes
she
said
carelessly
it
pretty
enough
i
do
care
much
for
lamps
not
to
read
by
it
bright
enough
for
anybody
but
a
blind
man
to
read
here
judith
glanced
at
the
ornate
chandelier
of
electric
lights
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
the
rooms
are
so
high
that
the
lights
are
out
of
reach
for
reading
but
this
is
beautiful
have
you
never
used
it
it
might
be
used
with
an
electric
connection
i
suppose
no
i
never
used
it
as
an
oil
lamp
i
hate
kerosene
oil
but
you
have
some
in
the
house
oh
yes
i
think
so
wayne
insisted
on
getting
some
little
something
always
happening
to
the
wires
out
here
that
one
of
the
numerous
joys
of
living
in
the
suburbs
let
fill
this
and
try
it
juliet
suggested
turning
a
pair
of
very
bright
eyes
upon
her
friend
if
you
never
lit
it
i
do
believe
you
half
appreciated
it
you
neglecting
one
of
the
prettiest
sources
of
decoration
you
have
in
the
house
out
of
sympathy
for
the
giver
whoever
he
was
you
ought
to
let
his
gift
have
a
chance
to
show
you
its
beauty
stevens
cathcart
gave
it
to
us
i
believe
said
judith
here
let
me
have
it
i
fill
it
since
you
insist
but
i
never
thought
very
much
of
it
it
was
put
away
in
a
closet
until
we
came
here
it
took
up
so
much
room
i
never
found
a
place
for
it
cathcart
gave
it
to
you
that
proves
my
point
that
it
worth
admiring
if
there
a
connoisseur
in
things
of
this
sort
it
he
he
probably
picked
it
up
in
some
european
shop
smiling
to
herself
as
if
something
gave
her
satisfaction
juliet
awaited
the
return
of
her
hostess
she
understood
from
the
manner
of
exit
with
the
lamp
that
the
free
and
easy
familiarity
with
which
guests
invaded
every
portion
of
anthony
little
home
was
not
to
be
made
a
precedent
for
the
same
sort
of
thing
in
judith
the
lamp
reappeared
accompanied
by
a
lamentation
over
the
disagreeable
qualities
of
kerosene
oil
for
any
use
whatever
you
can
put
electricity
into
this
and
use
it
as
a
if
you
prefer
said
juliet
as
she
lit
it
and
adjusted
the
shade
may
i
set
it
on
the
big
table
over
here
right
in
the
center
please
if
you
do
mind
moving
that
bowl
of
carnations
there
of
course
you
can
send
it
back
to
oblivion
over
there
on
the
bookcase
if
you
really
do
like
but
you
do
like
it
do
you
it
handsomer
than
i
thought
it
was
judith
admitted
without
enthusiasm
juliet
glanced
up
at
the
blazing
chandelier
overhead
may
i
turn
off
some
of
this
light
she
asked
you
wo
get
the
full
beauty
of
your
lamp
till
you
give
it
a
chance
by
itself
judith
assented
juliet
snapped
off
three
out
of
the
four
lights
and
smiled
mischievously
at
her
friend
then
she
extinguished
the
fourth
so
that
the
only
luminary
left
in
the
room
was
the
lamp
judith
groaned
maybe
you
like
a
gloomy
room
like
this
i
do
look
at
it
i
can
hardly
see
anything
in
the
corners
wait
a
little
bit
you
so
used
to
the
glare
your
eyes
are
not
good
for
seeing
what
i
mean
study
the
lamp
itself
a
minute
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
fascinating
as
the
gleam
through
those
jewels
an
electric
bulb
inside
would
add
to
the
brilliancy
though
it
not
so
soft
a
light
to
read
by
and
the
effect
in
the
room
is
so
warm
observe
those
carnations
under
the
lamplight
honey
come
over
here
to
the
doorway
and
look
at
your
whole
room
under
these
new
conditions
is
it
charming
enticing
let
draw
that
lovely
morris
chair
up
close
to
the
table
as
if
you
were
expecting
wayne
to
come
in
and
read
the
evening
paper
by
the
lamp
juliet
softly
clapped
her
hands
her
face
shining
with
friendly
enthusiasm
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
whole
room
as
she
had
said
had
taken
on
a
new
look
of
homelike
comfort
and
cheer
which
it
had
lacked
before
even
judith
was
forced
to
see
it
it
looks
very
well
she
admitted
but
i
should
have
more
light
from
above
i
like
plenty
of
light
so
do
i
if
you
manage
it
well
whereupon
the
guest
having
gained
her
point
and
made
sufficient
demonstration
of
it
turned
the
conversation
into
other
channels
but
the
lamp
was
not
yet
through
with
its
position
of
reformer
the
two
men
having
finished
their
cigars
and
hearing
sounds
of
merriment
from
the
adjoining
room
came
strolling
in
anthony
comprehending
at
a
glance
the
change
which
had
come
over
the
aspect
of
the
room
and
the
cause
thereof
advanced
smiling
but
carey
came
to
a
standstill
upon
the
threshold
his
lips
drawn
into
an
astonished
whistle
what
happened
he
ejaculated
and
stood
staring
do
you
like
it
asked
his
wife
i
should
say
i
did
but
what
done
it
what
makes
the
room
look
so
different
it
looks
why
it
looks
like
your
rooms
he
cried
gazing
at
anthony
he
can
say
nothing
more
flattering
than
that
said
judith
evidently
not
altogether
pleased
it
the
highest
compliment
he
knows
carey
stared
at
the
lamp
i
did
know
we
had
that
he
said
is
it
that
that
does
it
i
fancy
it
is
said
anthony
i
never
understood
it
till
i
was
taught
but
it
seems
to
be
a
fact
that
a
low
light
in
a
room
gives
it
a
more
homelike
effect
than
a
high
one
i
do
know
why
it
one
of
my
pet
theories
well
i
must
say
this
is
a
pretty
convincing
demonstration
of
it
carey
agreed
sitting
down
in
a
chair
in
a
corner
his
hands
in
his
pockets
still
studying
this
to
him
remarkable
transformation
it
certainly
does
look
like
a
happy
home
now
before
it
was
a
place
to
receive
calls
in
he
turned
smiling
contentedly
to
his
wife
something
about
the
glance
which
she
returned
warned
him
that
further
admiration
was
unnecessary
the
contented
smile
faded
a
little
he
got
up
and
came
over
to
the
table
now
let
have
a
good
talk
he
proposed
two
hours
later
in
the
seclusion
of
the
upstairs
anthony
said
under
his
breath
they
coming
on
are
they
do
you
see
glimmerings
of
hope
that
some
day
this
will
resemble
a
home
in
a
sort
of
way
is
judith
becoming
domesticated
a
trifle
she
did
get
up
that
dinner
juliet
turned
upon
him
a
smiling
face
and
laid
her
finger
on
her
lip
do
tempt
me
to
discuss
it
she
warned
him
my
feelings
might
run
away
with
me
and
that
would
never
do
under
their
very
roof
exemplary
little
guest
may
i
say
as
much
as
this
then
i
give
a
good
deal
to
see
wayne
speak
his
mind
once
in
a
way
without
a
side
glance
to
see
if
her
royal
majesty
approves
but
juliet
shook
her
head
do
tempt
me
she
begged
again
something
inside
of
me
that
boils
and
boils
with
rage
and
if
i
should
just
take
the
cover
off
might
i
get
scalded
all
right
i
leave
the
cover
on
just
one
observation
more
when
i
get
inside
our
own
four
walls
again
i
going
to
give
a
tremendous
whoop
of
joy
and
satisfaction
that
raise
the
roof
right
off
the
house
the
robeson
will
when
people
are
busy
and
happy
the
years
may
go
by
like
a
dream
so
the
months
rolled
around
and
brought
little
tony
past
the
third
anniversary
of
his
birth
and
into
another
summer
of
lusty
development
except
to
the
growing
child
however
time
seemed
to
bring
slight
changes
to
the
little
home
under
whose
roof
he
grew
the
mistress
thereof
lost
no
charm
either
for
her
husband
or
her
friends
anthony
indeed
insisted
that
she
grew
younger
certainly
as
time
taught
her
new
lessons
without
laying
hands
upon
her
beauty
she
gained
attractiveness
in
every
way
you
look
as
much
like
a
girl
as
ever
anthony
said
to
her
one
morning
as
dressed
for
a
trip
into
town
she
came
out
upon
the
porch
where
he
and
little
tony
were
frolicing
together
you
had
ever
a
sweetly
blarneying
tongue
said
she
and
bestowed
a
parting
caress
impartially
upon
both
the
persons
before
her
i
feel
a
bit
guilty
at
making
a
nursemaid
of
you
for
even
one
morning
of
your
vacation
but
that
all
right
do
your
errands
with
an
easy
conscience
i
enjoy
looking
after
the
boy
and
am
rather
glad
your
usual
little
maid
is
away
that
one
thing
my
vacation
is
for
to
get
upon
a
basis
of
mutual
understanding
and
confidence
with
my
son
we
see
too
little
of
each
other
so
juliet
caught
the
early
car
and
left
the
two
male
robesons
together
father
and
son
waving
to
her
from
the
porch
when
she
was
out
of
sight
the
elder
robeson
turned
to
the
younger
now
son
he
said
i

to
mow
the
lawn

tony

with
decision
all

in
front
of
me
and
mind
you
push
hard
that
the
stuff
all
went
joyously
for
ten
minutes
then
little
tony
wriggled
out
from
between
his
father
arms
and
went
over
to
the
porch
step
he
sat
down
and
crossed
two
fat
legs
he
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
watched
with
serious
eyes
the
progress
of
the
three
times
across
before
he
said
wistfully
favver
i
wis
you
wiv
me
when
i
get
this
job
done
perhaps
i
will
said
anthony
and
made
the
grass
fly
merrily
presently
he
put
away
the
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
sturdy
little
figure
in
the
blue
russian
blouse
what
do
you
want
to
play
he
asked
tony
face
lit
up
le
play
he
proposed
enthusiastically

said
tony
eagerly

son
his
father
responded
doubtfully
young
persons
of
three
are
not
considered
old
enough
to
play
with
the
real
thing
wo
make
believe

just
as

repeated
the
child
le
put

out
wiv
watto
favver
watto
repeated
anthony
laughing
what
do
you
mean
by
oh
i
see
as
tony
demonstrated
his
meaning
by
running
to
the
garden
hose
which
remained
attached
to
a
hydrant
behind
the
house
well
son
if
i
let
you
have
a
real
fire
and
put
it
out
with
real
water
will
you
promise
me
never
to
try
anything
of
that
sort
by
yourself
tony
walked
over
to
his
father
and
laid
a
little
brown
fist
in
anthony
aw
wight
he
said
solemnly
anthony
looked
down
at
the
clasped
hands
and
smiled
at
the
serious
uplifted
face
is
that
the
way
mother
teaches
you
to
promise
her
he
asked
with
interest
tony
nodded
aw
wight
he
said
come
on
le
make
fire
the
fire
was
made
out
of
a
brought
up
from
the
cellar
it
burned
realistically
down
by
the
orchard
and
was
only
discovered
by
chance
when
anthony
robeson
junior
happened
to
glance
that
way
fire
he
shouted
and
alarmed
the
fire
company
who
as
fire
companies
should
be
were
ready
to
start
on
the
instant
the
propelled
by
a
pair
of
stout
legs
made
a
gallant
dash
down
the
edge
of
the
garden
followed
by
the
company
their
equipment
just
three
feet
long
it
took
energetic
and
skilful
work
to
quench
the
conflagration
which
raged
furiously
and
made
plenty
of
good
black
smoke
the
fire
chief
rushed
dramatically
about
ordering
his
men
with
ringing
commands
once
he
stubbed
his
bare
toe
and
fell
and
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
though
he
must
cry
but
like
the
brave
fellow
that
he
was
he
smothered
his
pain
behind
an
uplifted
elbow
and
in
a
moment
was
again
in
the
thick
of
the
fray
his
men
obeyed
him
with
admirable
promptitude
although
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
of
fire
chiefs
he
himself
took
hold
of
the
hose
and
poured
its
volume
upon
the
blazing
structure
when
the
fire
was
out
the
chief
breathless
his
blue
blouse
bearing
the
marks
of
the
encounter
with
flood
and
flame
sat
down
upon
the
overturned
and
beamed
upon
his
company
vat
was
awful
nice
fire
he
said
le
have
anuver
another
oh
no
protested
the
company
hastily
no
more
of
that
just
now
pick
up
your
wagon
and
put
it
back
where
it
belongs
i
see
to
the
hose
anthony
gently
displaced
the
fire
chief
and
rolled
away
the
hose
then
he
looked
back
down
the
garden
and
saw
his
son
poking
among
the
ruins
of
the
fire
come
here
tony
he
called
and
bring
the
tony
came
slowly
but
without
the
toy
wagon
anthony
stood
still
when
the
boy
reached
him
he
said
why
did
you
bring
the
cart
i
ve
chief
tony
responded
gravely
my
mens
bring
ve
cart
your
men
are
there
you
have
to
bring
it
yourself
tony
shook
his
head
i
ve
chief
he
repeated
and
looked
his
father
in
the
eye
anthony
understood
it
was
not
the
first
time
there
were
moments
in
one
experience
with
anthony
robeson
junior
when
one
seemed
to
encounter
a
deadlock
in
the
child
will
reasoning
and
commands
were
apt
at
such
times
to
be
alike
futile
the
odd
thing
about
it
was
that
it
was
impossible
to
predict
when
these
moments
were
at
hand
they
arose
without
warning
when
the
boy
was
apparently
in
the
best
of
tempers
and
they
did
not
seem
to
be
the
result
of
any
previous
mismanagement
on
the
part
of
those
in
authority
over
him
of
one
point
anthony
senior
was
sure
the
child
like
all
children
and
possibly
more
than
most
possessed
a
vivid
imagination
when
he
announced
himself
to
be
a
fire
chief
there
could
be
no
question
that
he
believed
himself
to
be
for
the
time
that
which
he
pretended
to
be
his
father
understood
therefore
that
to
make
progress
with
the
boy
it
was
necessary
to
get
back
to
the
standpoint
of
reality
before
commands
could
be
expected
to
take
hold
so
he
sat
down
on
a
rustic
seat
near
juliet
roses
and
spoke
in
a
pleasantly
way
yes
you
been
a
fire
chief
son
and
a
good
one
that
was
a
great
game
but
the
game
is
over
now
and
you
not
a
fire
chief
any
more
you
tony
robeson
and
the
little
cart
is
your
plaything
father
wants
you
to
bring
it
here
and
put
it
in
its
place
in
the
house
it
looks
a
little
bit
like
rain
and
the
cart
must
be
left
out
to
get
wet
see
but
tony
still
shook
his
head
my
men
put
it
in
he
said
with
calmness
undisturbed
you
have
any
men
you
played
there
were
some
but
the
play
is
over
and
there
are
any
men
if
you
do
put
the
cart
in
it
may
get
wet
i
ve
chief
said
little
tony
chiefs
do
draw
carts
when
they
turned
back
to
little
boys
they
do
you
turned
back
to
a
little
boy
no
i
has
said
tony
and
his
eyes
met
his
father
unflinchingly
i
going
to
be
a
chief
all
ve
time
the
argument
seemed
unanswerable
anthony
considered
swiftly
what
to
do
he
studied
the
grave
brown
eyes
an
instant
in
silence
their
beauty
and
the
inflexibility
in
their
depths
appealing
to
him
with
equal
force
he
loved
the
tough
little
will
he
recognised
it
as
his
own
the
same
powerful
quality
which
had
brought
him
thus
far
on
the
road
to
fortune
after
being
landed
at
the
furthermost
end
from
the
goal
he
would
not
for
worlds
deal
with
his
son
will
in
any
but
the
way
which
should
seem
to
him
wisest
he
rose
from
his
seat
he
spoke
quietly
but
with
force
very
well
he
said
if
you
still
a
fire
chief
of
course
you
too
big
to
play
much
obliged
to
you
for
putting
out
my
fire
but
now
that
it
out
i
want
your
in
my
garden
any
longer
when
your
men
take
it
away
i
shall
be
glad
but
of
course
we
ca
play
any
more
till
you
stop
being
a
fire
chief
and
the
is
back
in
its
corner
in
the
nursery
when
you
are
ready
to
be
tony
robeson
again
find
me
in
my
den
he
smiled
at
his
son
and
walked
away
tony
watched
him
go
tony
hands
were
clasped
behind
his
back
his
legs
planted
wide
apart
anthony
senior
found
it
difficult
to
remain
in
the
den
he
was
obliged
to
keep
track
of
a
small
figure
in
a
blue
blouse
from
whichever
of
the
various
windows
commanded
the
doings
of
that
young
person
he
perceived
that
the
fire
chief
was
still
holding
dominion
over
the
scene
at
the
end
of
an
hour
small
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
anthony
looked
up
from
the
letter
he
was
attempting
to
write
favver
may
i
have
a
bread
and
butter
asked
a
pleasant
voice
anthony
turned
about
in
his
chair
is
the
in
the
nursery
he
inquired
gravely
tony
shook
his
head
oh
then
you
are
still
the
fire
chief
fire
chiefs
go
to
the
hotel
for
their
bread
and
butter
i
have
any
bread
and
butter
for
the
fire
chief
he
turned
back
to
his
desk
the
small
figure
in
the
doorway
stood
still
a
moment
then
the
footsteps
were
heard
retreating
five
minutes
later
anthony
looking
out
saw
tony
careering
about
the
garden
on
a
obstinate
little
duffer
he
said
affectionately
to
himself
playing
go
to
the
hotel
i
suppose
perhaps
when
that
imagination
of
his
gets
to
work
at
hypothetical
bread
and
butter
he
find
the
reality
preferable
to
the
fancy
in
a
short
time
anthony
again
reconnoitred
the
garden
was
empty
he
looked
out
at
the
front
of
the
house
no
small
figure
in
blue
was
to
be
seen
he
went
out
and
took
a
turn
about
the
place
he
called
the
boy
there
was
no
response
from
past
experience
and
from
the
statements
of
juliet
and
the
young
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
whom
at
various
times
she
was
in
the
habit
of
engaging
to
assist
her
in
the
oversight
of
the
child
at
his
play
he
knew
that
tony
had
a
trick
of
getting
himself
out
of
sight
in
an
incredibly
brief
space
of
time
as
a
fire
chief
he
may
consider
himself
free
to
do
what
he
pleases
said
anthony
to
himself
and
set
about
a
thorough
search
of
the
place
having
no
doubt
that
at
any
moment
he
should
come
upon
the
boy
carrying
out
the
details
of
his
imaginary
vocation
after
a
time
he
went
back
into
the
house
and
scoured
it
from
top
to
bottom
and
when
even
here
there
was
to
be
discovered
no
trace
of
the
child
he
began
to
feel
a
slight
uneasiness
there
was
no
source
of
immediate
danger
to
a
stray
child
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
he
was
aware
except
the
electric
line
and
little
tony
had
never
manifested
the
slightest
inclination
to
approach
this
by
himself
there
were
no
open
ponds
no
traps
of
any
kind
for
the
incautious
feet
of
a
everybody
knew
tony
and
everybody
admired
and
loved
him
so
that
as
anthony
took
up
his
hat
and
started
upon
a
more
extended
search
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
of
finding
the
runaway
without
delay
in
a
very
short
time
it
became
a
rousing
of
the
neighbourhood
it
was
saturday
and
all
the
children
who
knew
tony
were
at
hand
they
were
soon
eagerly
searching
for
him
near
and
far
without
finding
the
slightest
trace
of
his
passing
anthony
now
thoroughly
alarmed
telephoned
in
every
direction
warned
every
police
station
in
the
city
and
took
every
possible
step
for
the
discovery
of
the
child
it
occurred
to
him
with
tremendous
force
that
the
boy
might
have
been
stolen
such
things
did
happen
it
seemed
almost
the
only
way
to
account
for
such
a
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
before
it
seemed
possible
two
hours
had
slipped
past
and
now
on
every
car
which
whirled
by
the
corner
anthony
began
to
expect
juliet
he
dreaded
yet
longed
to
see
her
he
turned
cold
at
the
thought
of
telling
her
the
situation
yet
at
the
same
time
he
felt
as
if
she
might
have
some
sort
of
a
solution
ready
which
nobody
else
had
thought
of
and
while
still
searching
over
and
over
the
entire
ground
he
kept
watch
of
the
arriving
cars
he
saw
his
wife
suddenly
appear
he
went
to
meet
her
what
is
it
she
said
the
instant
her
eye
met
his
i
think
it
all
right
dear
he
told
her
as
quietly
as
he
could
but
somehow
we
ca
find
tony
he
disappeared
during
five
minutes
when
i
was
in
the
house
too
short
a
time
for
him
to
have
got
very
far
away
but
we
ca
find
him
do
you
think
he
may
be
hiding
does
he
ever
hide
himself
so
effectually
as
that
the
bright
colour
in
her
face
had
slipped
out
of
it
on
the
instant
for
he
could
not
keep
the
anxiety
out
of
his
voice
but
she
said
no
word
of
reproach
nor
did
she
lose
command
of
herself
in
any
way
how
long
has
he
been
gone
she
asked
going
straight
toward
the
house
anthony
close
behind
her
i
think
i
am
afraid
nearly
two
hours
i
will
tell
you
what
happened
it
is
possible
something
i
said
is
responsible
for
all
this
though
i
know
she
was
going
swiftly
about
the
house
as
he
told
her
the
story
of
his
attempt
to
teach
the
boy
a
lesson
and
she
was
listening
closely
to
every
word
as
she
examined
for
herself
each
nook
and
corner
she
disclosed
several
possible
hiding
places
of
which
anthony
had
not
thought
explaining
that
tony
knew
them
all
and
sometimes
betook
himself
to
them
in
the
course
of
various
games
the
two
came
out
upon
the
porch
and
juliet
stood
still
thinking
you
have
done
everything
to
intercept
him
if
he
should
really
have
got
far
away
everything
i
can
think
of
except
start
out
myself
i
am
ready
to
do
that
if
you
think
best
not
until
i
have
gone
over
the
neighbourhood
myself
i
do
believe
he
is
far
away
i
believe
he
is
near
he
may
have
heard
every
call
you
and
the
children
have
made
and
would
answer
if
by
any
chance
his
pride
has
been
a
little
hurt
he
is
very
likely
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
wait
have
you
looked
i
wonder
if
the
children
know
she
was
off
without
stopping
to
explain
through
the
garden
and
down
the
old
path
by
the
brook
anthony
followed
i
been
down
here
a
dozen
times
he
called
the
brook
is
too
shallow
to
hurt
him
and
he
certainly
not
anywhere
on
it
within
a
mile
the
children
have
been
all
over
the
ground
but
juliet
did
not
pause
she
ran
along
the
path
for
some
distance
then
turned
abruptly
at
a
point
where
an
abandoned
lot
filled
with
stumps
joined
the
area
by
the
brook
she
made
her
swift
way
among
these
stumps
anthony
following
his
hope
rising
as
he
noted
the
directness
of
his
wife
aim
at
the
biggest
stump
she
came
to
a
standstill
carefully
swung
like
a
door
a
great
slab
of
bark
and
disclosed
a
hollow
the
sunlight
streamed
in
upon
a
little
heap
of
blue
and
a
tangled
brown
mass
of
hair
anthony
robeson
junior
lay
fast
asleep
in
his
cunningly
devised
retreat
without
a
word
his
father
stood
looking
down
at
the
boy
flushed
cheeks
then
he
turned
to
juliet
standing
beside
him
smiling
through
the
tears
which
had
not
come
until
the
anxiety
was
past
his
own
eyes
were
wet
that
was
a
bad
scare
he
said
softly
thank
god
it
over
then
he
stooped
and
gently
lifted
the
fire
chief
and
carried
him
home
without
waking
him
twenty
children
flocked
joyfully
from
all
about
to
see
and
hushed
their
shouts
of
congratulation
at
juliet
smiling
warning
anthony
went
alone
down
the
garden
to
the
place
where
the
cart
had
stood
it
was
still
there
he
stood
and
looked
at
it
his
eyes
very
tender
but
his
lips
firm
the
little
chap
did
give
in
he
said
to
himself
it
going
to
be
hard
to
make
him
but
for
the
sake
of
the
robeson
will
i
think
we
have
to
take
up
the
job
where
we
left
it
mightily
like
to
flunk
the
whole
business
now
but
i
should
be
a
pretty
weak
sort
of
a
beggar
if
i
did
when
little
tony
had
wakened
from
his
nap
and
had
been
washed
and
brushed
and
fed
and
made
fresh
in
a
clean
frock
his
mother
brought
him
to
his
father
is
this
tony
robeson
anthony
asked
soberly
tony
considered
for
a
moment
then
shook
his
head
i
ve
fire
chief
he
said
with
polite
stubbornness
have
your
men
put
away
the
cart
no
favver
are
they
going
to
do
it
i
did
tell
vem
to
why
not
did
want
to
listen
son
said
anthony
i
could
make
the
fire
chief
put
away
the
cart
i
stronger
than
he
is
you
know
i
could
make
him
walk
out
to
where
it
lies
in
the
garden
and
i
could
make
his
hands
pick
it
up
and
carry
it
into
the
house
and
then
it
would
be
do
you
think
i
could
tony
considered
es
i
fink
could
he
admitted
evidently
the
question
was
one
he
could
reflect
upon
from
the
standpoint
of
the
outsider
but
i
do
want
to
do
that
i
want
tony
robeson
to
put
the
cart
away
because
his
father
asks
him
to
do
it
do
you
think
he
ought
to
do
that
i
is
tony
robeson
ve
fire
chief
were
you
the
fire
chief
when
you
woke
up
and
mother
washed
you
and
dressed
you
and
gave
you
your
lunch
i
do
think
she
thought
you
were
if
you
had
been
the
fire
chief
she
would
have
left
you
to
take
care
of
yourself
tony
thought
about
it
i
dess
tony
wiv
muvver
he
said
then
you
are
tony
with
me
the
thick
locks
shook
vehemently
in
the
sir
with
the
negative
response
i
said
i
was
ve
fire
chief
and
got
to
ve
fire
chief
he
reiterated
without
question
it
was
a
battle
of
wills
but
anthony
mind
was
made
up
for
lack
of
time
to
deal
with
them
previous
similar
issues
had
been
dodged
in
various
ways
compromises
had
been
effected
it
was
plain
that
argument
and
reasoning
the
wiles
of
the
affectionately
wise
adversary
who
does
not
want
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
direct
conflict
had
been
tried
anthony
could
see
no
way
out
except
to
dominate
the
child
by
the
force
of
his
own
resolute
character
it
was
not
the
way
by
which
he
wanted
to
obtain
the
mastery
but
it
was
becoming
plain
to
him
that
in
this
case
at
least
it
was
the
only
way
left
his
face
grew
stern
all
at
once
his
eyes
though
still
kind
met
his
son
with
determination
tony
he
said
very
gravely
and
there
was
a
new
quality
in
his
tone
to
which
the
child
was
not
accustomed
you
are
not
the
fire
chief
now
you
are
tony
robeson
shall
not
let
you
be
the
fire
chief
any
do
you
understand
there
was
no
threat
in
the
words
only
a
decisiveness
of
the
sort
before
which
men
give
way
because
they
see
that
there
is
no
alternative
tony
stared
into
his
father
eyes
curiously
his
own
grew
big
with
wonder
with
something
which
was
not
alarm
but
akin
to
it
he
gazed
and
gazed
as
if
fascinated
anthony
look
held
his
the
man
powerful
eyes
did
not
flinch
neither
did
the
boy
it
is
possible
that
both
pulses
quickened
a
beat
little
tony
drew
his
eyes
away
at
last
turned
and
started
for
the
door
silently
anthony
watched
him
as
he
reached
for
the
knob
turned
again
and
looked
back
at
his
father
on
the
very
threshold
the
child
stood
still
and
stared
back
his
brown
eyes
filled
his
red
lips
quivered
the
stern
face
which
watched
his
melted
into
a
winning
smile
and
anthony
held
out
his
arms
an
instant
longer
and
his
son
had
run
across
the
floor
and
flung
himself
into
them
when
the
childish
storm
of
tears
had
quieted
and
several
big
hugs
had
been
exchanged
anthony
set
the
boy
down
upon
the
floor
and
took
his
hand
silently
the
two
walked
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
garden
the
cart
stood
patiently
waiting
just
where
it
had
waited
all
day
little
tony
ran
to
it
and
picked
it
up
over
his
exquisite
face
broke
the
first
smile
that
had
been
seen
there
since
the
earliest
disregarded
command
of
the
morning
ve
fire
chief
gone
he
said
he
was
a
bad
fire
chief
so
together
the
man
and
the
boy
escorted
the
cart
to
the
nursery
and
backed
it
carefully
into
its
stall
between
the
milk
wagon
and
the
automobile
then
the
child
went
to
his
play
but
the
man
drew
a
long
breath
i
would
rather
manage
a
hundred
striking
workmen
he
said
to
himself
with
emphasis
on
guard
while
little
tony
had
been
growing
waxing
strong
and
sturdy
while
juliet
had
been
tending
and
training
him
learning
as
every
mother
does
more
than
she
could
impart
anthony
in
his
place
had
not
stood
still
the
strength
and
determination
he
had
from
the
first
hour
put
into
his
daily
work
had
begun
to
tell
his
position
in
a
great
mercantile
establishment
had
steadily
advanced
as
he
had
made
himself
more
and
more
indispensable
to
its
heads
cathcart
the
successful
architect
began
to
talk
about
a
new
home
for
the
man
into
whose
hands
henderson
and
henderson
were
putting
large
interests
to
manage
for
them
and
whose
salary
he
asserted
must
now
justify
indeed
call
for
life
under
more
ideal
surroundings
than
the
little
home
in
the
unfashionable
suburb
which
poverty
had
at
first
made
necessary
let
me
draw
some
plans
for
you
urged
cathcart
one
evening
in
june
when
he
had
run
out
to
see
his
friend
juliet
was
by
chance
away
and
cathcart
took
advantage
of
this
to
call
anthony
attention
in
a
politely
frank
fashion
to
the
shortcomings
of
his
present
residence
it
all
right
in
its
way
he
said
standing
upon
a
corner
of
the
lawn
with
anthony
and
surveying
the
house
critically
robeson
certainly
deserves
full
credit
for
the
admirable
way
in
which
she
restored
the
old
house
and
added
just
the
changes
in
keeping
with
its
possibilities
always
said
it
could
have
been
better
done
with
the
means
you
told
me
you
were
able
to
put
at
her
disposal
but
the
place
is
too
small
for
you
now
i
do
think
we
feel
it
so
said
anthony
tentatively
strolling
beside
cathcart
along
the
edge
of
the
lawn
his
hands
in
his
pockets
lifting
friendly
eyes
at
the
little
house
since
we
put
in
the
bathroom
that
small
room
off
the
upper
hall
you
know
and
added
the
nursery
and
den
we
very
comfortable
the
furnace
keeps
us
warm
as
toast
and
we
soon
to
have
the
water
system
out
here
so
we
wo
have
to
depend
upon
our
present
expedients
i
fond
of
the
place
and
i
confident
robeson
is
devoted
to
it
i
can
understand
that
agreed
cathcart
of
course
the
spot
where
you
began
life
together
will
always
have
its
charm
for
you
both
in
fact
the
sentiment
of
the
matter
may
blind
you
to
the
real
inadequacies
of
the
place
for
a
man
in
your
position
my
position
is
so
stable
that
i
want
to
build
a
marble
palace
on
it
yet
said
anthony
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eye
he
enjoyed
watching
another
man
manoeuvre
for
his
favourable
hearing
of
a
scheme
it
was
an
art
in
which
he
was
himself
accomplished
it
was
one
of
the
points
of
his
value
to
henderson
and
henderson
everybody
knows
that
you
in
a
fair
way
to
become
head
man
with
the
hendersons
said
cathcart
and
everybody
also
knows
that
you
might
as
well
have
struck
a
it
superb
the
way
you
have
come
into
the
confidence
of
those
old
conservatives
that
all
well
enough
but
i
do
see
that
it
entails
upon
me
the
duty
of
laying
out
all
i
saved
on
a
new
house
i
know
what
you
fellows
are
when
you
begin
to
draw
plans
your
love
of
the
ideal
runs
away
with
the
other
man
pocketbook
not
at
all
declared
cathcart
particularly
when
he
a
friend
and
you
understand
just
what
he
can
afford
to
do
why
do
you
talk
about
enlarging
the
old
house
that
much
more
likely
to
appeal
to
my
desires
the
two
had
reached
the
back
of
the
house
and
were
close
by
the
kitchen
windows
cathcart
reached
up
and
took
hold
of
a
sill
with
a
strong
hand
he
wrenched
and
pounded
about
the
window
until
he
succeeded
in
showing
that
it
was
old
and
uncertain
that
why
he
said
dusting
his
hand
with
his
handkerchief
the
house
is
old
fairly
rotten
in
places
the
minute
you
began
to
enlarge
it
in
any
ambitious
way
you
find
it
would
be
cheaper
to
tear
it
down
and
begin
again
but
the
site
robeson
the
site
is
desirable
the
place
is
respectable
enough
but
it
has
no
future
the
good
building
is
all
going
south
not
north
of
the
city
you
do
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
here
you
could
sell
out
except
at
a
loss
your
arguments
are
good
very
good
admitted
anthony
so
good
that
like
to
put
you
on
your
mettle
to
draw
me
a
set
of
plans
for
just
the
sort
of
thing
you
think
i
ought
to
have
or
robeson
ought
to
have
for
she
the
one
to
be
considered
anything
will
do
for
me
i
let
you
do
this
on
one
condition
name
it
that
you
also
do
your
level
best
to
demonstrate
to
me
what
a
clever
man
and
an
artist
of
your
proportions
could
make
out
of
this
house
provided
he
really
wanted
to
show
the
extent
of
his
ability
now
that
fair
if
you
really
care
to
convince
me
you
wo
fool
with
this
proposition
you
make
a
study
of
the
one
problem
as
thoroughly
as
you
do
of
the
other
and
let
me
decide
the
case
on
its
merits
if
i
thought
you
giving
the
old
house
a
fair
chance
i
should
take
up
its
cause
out
of
pure
affection
he
smiled
at
cathcart
discontented
face
with
so
brilliant
a
good
humour
that
the
architect
cleared
up
by
jove
robeson
he
said
i
think
i
see
what
endears
you
to
the
hendersons
i
would
have
said
you
could
have
induced
me
to
try
my
hand
at
the
old
house
but
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
follow
your
instructions
to
the
letter
and
win
out
too
good
said
anthony
and
do
mention
it
to
my
wife
we
keep
it
for
a
surprise
and
i
promise
you
when
the
time
comes
i
wo
prejudice
her
in
any
way
cathcart
drew
out
a
notebook
and
pencil
and
entered
some
memoranda
on
the
spot
while
anthony
coming
up
on
the
piazza
of
the
laid
upon
the
old
dutch
a
hand
which
seemed
to
caress
it
he
was
wondering
if
by
any
possible
magic
cathcart
could
create
in
the
rarest
abode
in
the
world
a
new
door
which
he
should
ever
care
to
enter
as
he
now
cared
to
enter
this
i
think
said
juliet
decidedly
you
wrong
about
it
and
i
know
returned
anthony
with
emphasis
that
you
are
the
two
faced
each
other
they
were
walking
through
a
short
stretch
of
woodland
which
lay
as
yet
untouched
by
the
hand
of
suburban
property
owners
it
was
a
favourite
ground
for
the
diversions
of
the
robesons
when
they
had
not
time
to
spend
in
getting
farther
away
they
had
been
strolling
through
it
now
in
the
early
june
evening
discussing
a
matter
relative
to
the
investment
of
a
certain
moderate
sum
of
money
which
had
come
into
anthony
hands
it
developed
that
their
ideas
about
it
differed
radically
it
not
safe
to
do
as
you
propose
said
juliet
to
do
what
you
propose
would
be
only
one
better
than
tying
it
up
in
an
old
stocking
or
putting
it
away
in
the
coffee
pot
it
essentially
a
woman
plan
no
man
would
do
it
the
honour
of
considering
it
a
moment
juliet
flushed
brilliantly
even
in
anthony
cheek
the
colour
rose
a
little
their
eyes
met
with
a
challenge
very
well
said
juliet
proudly
i
offer
no
more
woman
plans
invest
the
money
as
you
like
then
when
you
lost
it
anthony
eyes
flashed
when
i
lost
it
he
began
and
turned
away
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
then
he
stopped
short
that
is
like
you
he
said
juliet
stared
at
him
an
instant
then
she
shut
her
lips
together
and
walked
on
in
silence
anthony
shut
his
lips
together
also
it
was
not
their
habit
to
indulge
in
sharp
altercation
while
both
had
decided
ideas
about
things
both
were
also
much
too
well
bred
to
be
willing
to
allow
differences
of
opinion
which
must
arise
as
inevitably
as
two
human
beings
live
under
the
same
roof
to
degenerate
into
the
deplorable
thing
commonly
referred
to
as
a
quarrel
when
they
had
proceeded
a
few
rods
juliet
turned
abruptly
off
from
the
path
and
picked
up
from
the
ground
a
slender
straight
stick
evidently
cut
and
trimmed
by
some
boy
and
then
thrown
aside
she
looked
about
her
and
after
some
search
found
another
of
similar
size
untrimmed
she
held
out
the
latter
to
anthony
he
accepted
it
with
a
look
of
surprise
then
she
walked
into
the
path
in
front
of
him
stood
stiff
and
straight
her
small
heels
together
and
made
him
the
fencer
salute
guard
she
cried
his
lips
relaxing
anthony
grasped
his
stick
and
fell
into
position
a
moment
more
and
two
accomplished
fencers
were
engaged
in
close
combat
juliet
happened
to
be
wearing
a
trim
linen
skirt
of
short
walking
length
which
impeded
her
movements
as
slightly
as
anything
not
strictly
adapted
to
the
exercise
could
do
although
her
fencing
lessons
were
some
years
past
the
paraphernalia
belonging
both
to
herself
and
anthony
were
in
the
house
and
an
occasional
bout
with
the
masks
and
foils
was
a
means
of
exercise
and
diversion
which
both
thoroughly
enjoyed
although
juliet
was
no
match
for
the
superior
skill
and
endurance
of
her
husband
she
was
nevertheless
no
mean
antagonist
and
her
alertness
of
eye
and
hand
usually
gave
him
sufficient
to
do
to
make
the
encounter
a
stimulating
one
on
the
present
occasion
anthony
challenged
to
combat
with
his
coat
and
cuffs
on
and
wielding
the
more
awkward
weapon
of
the
two
impromptu
foils
found
himself
distinctly
at
a
disadvantage
moreover
he
was
at
the
moment
not
precisely
in
the
mood
for
fun
and
he
began
to
defend
himself
with
a
somewhat
lazy
indifference
after
a
minute
or
two
however
he
discovered
that
his
adversary
slightly
ruffled
temper
was
inspiring
her
hand
and
wrist
to
distinctly
effective
work
and
he
found
himself
forced
to
look
to
his
methods
attack
and
parade
disengagement
and
thrust
the
battle
was
waged
over
the
uneven
ground
of
the
wood
and
presently
anthony
discovered
that
the
richly
glowing
face
opposite
his
was
a
smiling
one
the
absurdity
of
the
match
struck
him
irresistibly
and
he
smiled
in
return
he
tripped
a
little
over
an
obtruding
and
juliet
took
advantage
of
her
opportunity
to
press
him
hard
he
fended
off
the
attack
and
himself
assumed
the
aggressive
an
instant
more
and
he
had
disarmed
her
and
had
thrown
his
own
stick
flying
after
hers
both
were
laughing
heartily
enough
forgive
the
trick
cried
anthony
a
man
must
disarm
his
wife
when
she
becomes
his
enemy
breathless
juliet
sank
upon
a
small
knoll
her
hand
at
her
side
if
been
dressed
for
it
she
panted
you
need
coaching
on
your
time
thrusts
but
you
gave
me
plenty
to
do
as
it
was
anthony
admitted
more
than
that
you
presented
me
with
a
chance
to
recover
my
equilibrium
i
was
hot
inside
before
now
it
all
on
the
outside
he
looked
down
at
her
affectionately
she
smiled
back
i
was
crosser
than
sticks
she
said
i
really
ca
imagine
why
now
i
apologise
so
do
i
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
ground
at
her
feet
lay
flat
on
his
back
his
clasped
hands
behind
his
head
and
gazed
up
into
the
i
take
your
advice
into
careful
consideration
said
he
i
know
you
wo
do
anything
rash
said
she
and
they
both
laughed
again
how
much
more
diplomatic
that
sort
of
talk
is
he
observed
why
do
we
ever
allow
ourselves
to
use
any
other
because
we
are
human
i
suppose
juliet
was
putting
a
mass
of
waving
brown
hair
disordered
by
the
fight
into
shape
again
it
is
nice
we
do
do
it
often
you
came
home
tired
and
found
a
wife
who
had
been
entertaining
people
from
town
all
the
afternoon
but
it
all
right
now
is
it
she
bent
forward
and
anthony
took
her
outstretched
hand
in
his
own
and
gave
it
a
grip
which
made
it
sting
he
began
to
whistle
cheerfully
should
we
be
happier
if
we
never
disagreed
she
asked
thoughtfully
the
whistle
stopped
jupiter
no
i
want
a
thinking
being
to
talk
things
over
with
not
a
mental
pincushion
thank
is
it
lovely
here
julie
do
you
know
we
have
been
married
five
years
next
september
it
does
seem
possible
i
should
know
it
to
look
at
you
he
observed
he
rolled
upon
his
left
side
and
regarded
her
from
under
intent
brows
you
have
grown
a
day
older
i
not
sure
that
a
compliment
it
meant
for
one
do
you
know
you
a
beauty
i
never
was
one
and
never
shall
be
she
answered
laughing
but
she
could
not
object
to
the
obvious
sincerity
of
his
opinion
as
he
delivered
it
you
near
enough
to
satisfy
me
i
rather
have
your
good
looks
than
all
the
well
i
sat
in
front
of
a
newly
married
pair
on
the
way
home
that
fellow
scrivener
and
his
bride
what
people
call
a
raving
beauty
i
suppose
i
would
have
her
in
the
house
at
a
dollar
an
hour
she
a
whiner
had
him
doing
something
to
satisfy
her
whim
every
minute
i
heard
him
trying
to
tell
her
about
something
that
interested
him
but
she
could
take
time
from
herself
to
listen
his
voice
had
a
note
of
fatigue
in
it
already
or
i
not
robeson
i
tell
you
juliet
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
makes
a
bachelor
vow
to
stay
single
and
he
ca
be
blamed
suppose
a
bachelor
had
overheard
us
half
an
hour
ago
i
glad
none
did
but
if
he
had
it
would
have
disgusted
him
the
way
the
other
sort
of
thing
did
me
a
brisk
little
altercation
is
nothing
with
unlimited
hours
of
friendliness
and
understanding
before
and
after
but
a
perpetual
drizzle
of
fault
finding
and
exactions
would
make
a
fellow
go
hang
himself
robeson
do
you
know
you
a
very
exceptional
young
person
in
what
way
sir
whatever
you
do
you
never
nag
i
an
awful
suspicion
that
judith
carey
nags
you
know
how
to
let
a
man
alone
when
he
in
the
mood
for
being
alone
she
never
does
carey
had
me
out
there
not
long
ago
for
what
he
called
a
quiet
confidential
talk
on
some
business
matters
we
went
into
what
is
supposed
to
be
his
private
room
and
shut
the
door
probably
she
came
to
that
door
not
less
than
twelve
times
during
that
two
hours
she
called
carey
away
on
every
sort
of
pretext
once
she
got
him
to
do
a
stroke
of
work
for
her
that
took
up
at
least
ten
minutes
neither
of
us
could
spare
and
she
looked
like
a
thundercloud
every
time
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
cæsar
think
of
having
to
live
with
that
sort
of
person
no
wonder
carey
looks
old
before
his
time
it
certainly
unfortunate
but
i
not
an
exception
tony
there
are
plenty
of
women
who
know
when
to
keep
out
of
the
way
well
then
they
erratic
on
some
other
line
that
all
absolutely
the
only
thoroughly
sweet
and
sane
woman
i
know
my
dear
boy
remember
how
snappish
i
was
just
this
evening
i
was
grouchy
enough
to
match
it
i
tell
you
julie
the
women
who
talk
you
to
death
on
every
subject
important
or
trivial
bore
you
with
idiotic
questions
or
impertinence
about
your
affairs
how
do
i
know
so
much
about
my
dear
dozens
of
them
come
into
the
office
every
day
and
henderson
has
acquired
a
habit
lately
of
turning
them
all
over
to
me
i
earn
a
double
salary
every
hour
i
spend
that
way
wish
i
could
put
in
a
demand
for
it
speaking
of
salaries
dear
anthony
suddenly
sat
up
i
no
right
to
be
grouchy
for
i
promised
another
advance
next
month
splendid
she
put
out
her
hand
and
the
two
shook
hands
vigorously
again
like
the
pair
of
comrades
they
were
juliet
said
her
husband
watching
her
face
closely
it
been
a
happy
five
years
has
it
a
happy
five
years
tony
do
you
mean
it
he
smiled
at
her
you
never
been
sorry
then
he
got
to
his
feet
and
held
out
his
hand
again
to
help
her
up
the
mortal
combat
we
engaged
in
gave
you
a
magnificent
colour
he
commented
and
passed
affectionate
fingers
across
the
smooth
cheek
near
his
shoulder
sweetheart
he
drew
her
into
his
arms
i
may
fence
with
you
once
in
a
while
with
sharp
words
for
weapons
but
do
you
know
how
i
love
you
i
wonder
why
it
strange
is
it
after
all
these
years
to
be
really
we
should
long
since
have
become
interested
each
in
some
other
a
hand
came
gently
but
effectually
upon
his
mouth
he
kissed
the
hand
no
i
wo
say
it
it
a
cynical
philosophy
and
i
not
take
its
language
on
my
lips
not
with
my
wife
in
my
arms
giving
the
lie
to
that
sort
of
thing
julie
we
not
sentimentalists
because
we
still
care
who
thinks
we
are
plenty
of
envious
skeptics
i
wager
i
see
it
in
their
glances
they
ca
believe
it
genuine
dear
is
it
genuine
look
up
and
tell
me
she
looked
up
and
seeing
his
heart
in
his
eyes
met
his
deep
caress
with
a
tenderness
which
told
him
more
than
she
could
have
put
into
the
words
she
suddenly
found
it
impossible
to
speak
lockwood
pays
a
call
did
you
know
roger
barnes
was
back
asked
wayne
carey
of
anthony
robeson
on
the
evening
of
the
of
june
as
the
two
met
on
the
street
corner
from
which
anthony
was
to
take
his
car
electrics
ran
within
a
few
rods
of
his
home
now
but
they
ran
only
at
intervals
and
were
difficult
to
catch
no
to
stay
this
time
i
hope
off
again
never
saw
such
a
fellow
restless
as
a
fish
been
working
all
winter
in
vienna
off
on
the
overland
limited
to
sail
saturday
for
hongkong
goes
to
do
a
special
operation
on
the
emperor
brother
or
some
swell
of
the
sort
he
been
doing
some
mighty
slick
operating
according
to
the
medical
review
i
ran
across
in
a
throat
specialist
office
i
must
see
him
where
is
he
at
your
house
now
more
than
likely
said
he
got
to
see
you
and
if
you
have
seen
him
yet
you
sure
to
before
he
goes
night
by
the
way
anthony
do
you
know
what
we
heard
lately
about
rachel
redding
huntington
that
she
was
married
to
huntington
till
the
night
he
died
almost
three
years
ago
anthony
stared
guess
it
straight
too
pursued
carey
queer
she
should
have
kept
it
all
this
time
did
juliet
hear
from
her
at
all
only
once
or
twice
i
believe
her
father
and
mother
both
died
last
winter
are
you
sure
the
man
who
told
me
was
a
traveller
said
she
and
huntington
mother
were
coming
back
to
live
east
again
he
was
an
eastern
man
himself
knew
huntington
and
got
interested
when
he
heard
the
name
out
in
arizona
huntington
rather
an
uncommon
name
you
know
but
what
could
have
been
her
motive
for
keeping
everything
so
still
i
no
idea
said
anthony
and
let
carey
talk
on
by
himself
till
the
car
came
he
was
unwilling
to
discuss
rachel
redding
affairs
on
a
street
corner
even
with
wayne
carey
because
she
was
juliet
friend
but
he
had
an
idea
as
to
why
rachel
had
been
so
reserved
about
herself
there
were
three
men
in
the
east
whose
interest
in
huntington
life
or
death
had
not
been
an
altogether
unbiased
one
he
could
understand
that
the
girl
would
not
be
eager
to
declare
herself
free
to
them
though
the
fact
of
huntington
death
had
reached
them
soon
after
its
occurrence
but
this
other
fact
that
she
had
married
him
only
at
the
last
moment
it
was
obvious
that
the
sort
of
girl
rachel
redding
was
would
never
make
capital
out
of
that
strange
occurrence
whatever
its
explanation
might
be
that
roger
barnes
knew
nothing
of
it
he
was
quite
certain
he
missed
juliet
from
the
corner
where
she
and
the
boy
usually
met
him
and
hurrying
on
to
the
house
came
upon
his
wife
just
as
she
was
leaving
oh
i
did
realise
i
was
late
dear
she
said
while
anthony
swung
his
little
son
up
to
his
shoulder
eliciting
triumphant
shouts
as
a
reward
tony
rachel
is
here
hush
yes
she
upstairs
and
her
window
is
open
walk
down
the
orchard
with
me
and
i
tell
you
her
coming
an
hour
ago
was
what
made
me
forget
the
time
carey
was
talking
about
her
this
afternoon
said
anthony
strolling
by
her
side
and
carrying
on
a
frolic
with
the
boy
at
the
same
time
just
heard
a
singular
thing
that
she
was
married
to
huntington
till
the
very
night
he
died
she
told
me
she
going
away
she
insists
but
i
shall
not
let
her
no
huntington
would
let
her
marry
him
after
they
went
away
he
said
he
would
take
her
unless
he
got
well
tony
he
was
a
fine
character
in
our
sympathy
for
roger
barnes
we
have
appreciated
him
it
was
only
at
the
last
that
he
let
her
do
it
she
found
out
how
happy
it
would
make
him
then
and
she
would
have
it
so
i
glad
she
did
poor
fellow
juliet
roger
barnes
is
in
town
really
juliet
stopped
her
breath
catching
oh
tony
came
day
before
yesterday
leaves
night
for
hongkong
tony
anthony
looked
down
at
her
smiling
there
a
situation
for
you
can
you
be
expected
to
keep
your
friendly
hands
off
that
possibility
he
wo
go
away
without
coming
to
see
us
most
certainly
not
then
he
will
naturally
come
it
more
than
probable
tony
i
wo
be
trying
to
manage
fate
that
what
the
doctor
calls
it
if
i
keep
rachel
here
until
after
until
after
the
overland
limited
leaves
for
san
francisco
well
fate
needs
a
little
assistance
once
in
a
while
i
think
you
may
legitimately
persuade
rachel
to
stay
if
you
can
what
is
her
hurry
anyway
i
ca
find
out
except
that
i
imagine
she
afraid
of
meeting
one
of
the
men
she
most
assuredly
would
meet
if
they
knew
she
had
come
she
thinks
roger
barnes
is
in
vienna
still
she
does
ye
gods
i
think
my
knees
will
begin
to
tremble
if
i
see
their
meeting
imminent
come
son
let
try
a
race
to
the
house
i
give
you
to
the
big
crooked
apple
tree
one
two
three
go
juliet
followed
more
slowly
thinking
busily
rachel
had
been
very
decided
about
going
back
into
the
city
that
night
huntington
senior
was
with
friends
who
had
begged
her
daughter
acceptance
of
their
hospitality
and
for
the
elder
woman
sake
she
had
acquiesced
rachel
was
a
keeper
of
promises
juliet
knew
and
to
tell
her
of
the
probability
of
the
doctor
appearance
would
be
a
doubtful
means
of
securing
her
detention
but
if
for
any
reason
the
doctor
should
fail
to
appear
juliet
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
give
fate
her
chance
until
nine
that
night
if
by
that
time
barnes
had
not
come
juliet
looked
on
eagerly
while
anthony
greeted
rachel
her
friend
had
never
seemed
to
her
so
lovely
as
now
in
her
simple
black
gown
accentuating
as
it
did
the
deep
tone
of
her
hair
and
eyes
her
face
had
gained
in
colour
and
contour
in
the
arizona
climate
its
tints
were
richer
the
delicacy
of
her
features
was
not
changed
but
their
beauty
was
greater
you
lived
much
outdoors
i
see
said
anthony
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
three
had
gone
out
upon
the
porch
and
it
been
good
for
you
i
even
slept
outdoors
rachel
told
them
fully
half
the
year
and
ridden
horseback
every
day
i
ca
quite
think
how
the
electrics
are
going
to
seem
in
place
of
my
gallop
on
scot
the
people
on
the
ranch
where
we
were
have
simply
made
me
do
the
things
they
did
the
owner
was
a
dear
old
gentleman
he
gave
me
scot
he
wanted
to
send
him
after
me
but
nurses
have
small
use
for
horses
i
believe
she
ended
smiling
that
the
plan
is
it
yes
it
what
i
can
do
best
i
think
i
am
to
enter
the
the
first
of
july
at
the
larchmont
memorial
hospital
i
wager
tremendous
odds
you
do
thought
anthony
in
spite
of
that
confident
tone
if
roger
barnes
looks
in
it
all
up
with
your
plans
or
make
a
bigger
fight
than
even
you
can
do
a
man
who
ca
stay
in
his
own
town
because
you
are
out
of
it
he
was
sitting
purposely
where
he
faced
the
road
he
had
considerately
offered
rachel
a
chair
with
her
back
to
the
highway
juliet
was
swinging
lightly
in
the
hammock
behind
the
vines
anthony
talking
on
about
arizona
and
the
larchmont
memorial
kept
an
eye
on
the
approach
to
the
house
from
the
corner
where
visitors
always
left
the
car
his
watch
was
rewarded
at
length
by
the
sight
of
a
figure
rapidly
turning
the
corner
and
making
straight
for
the
house
now
we
in
for
it
he
thought
from
now
on
the
question
with
juliet
and
me
will
be
how
we
can
most
gracefully
efface
ourselves
without
seeming
to
do
it
if
i
remember
this
young
person
correctly
she
a
little
difficult
to
leave
unchaperoned
against
her
will
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
kept
track
of
the
approaching
figure
it
was
coming
on
at
a
great
pace
and
in
the
twilight
could
be
seen
looming
taller
and
taller
as
it
crossed
the
road
and
turned
in
across
the
lawn
making
a
short
cut
according
to
barnes
own
fashion
so
that
the
coming
footsteps
were
noiseless
even
to
the
moment
when
the
figure
reached
the
porch
itself
now
for
it
thought
anthony
feeling
as
if
the
curtain
were
about
to
ascend
on
the
fourth
act
of
a
play
when
the
third
had
ended
amidst
all
possible
excitement
i
found
the
roses
blooming
just
as
they
used
to
do
at
the
side
of
the
house
rachel
warm
contralto
voice
was
answering
a
question
from
juliet
only
so
untended
i
think
i
shall
have
to
come
out
again
before
i
begin
my
work
to
look
after
them
anthony
did
not
turn
as
the
step
he
had
been
watching
for
sounded
upon
the
porch
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
help
keeping
his
eyes
upon
face
rachel
herself
looked
up
with
the
air
of
the
visitor
who
does
not
know
the
guests
of
the
house
and
the
expression
anthony
saw
upon
her
face
showed
only
the
slightest
possible
surprise
certainly
no
other
feeling
juliet
rose
ah
lockwood
she
said
with
a
cordiality
sincere
little
person
though
she
was
anthony
knew
for
once
she
did
not
feel
in
the
dusk
i
could
be
quite
sure
lockwood
eyes
instantly
turned
to
rachel
that
he
had
known
in
some
way
whom
he
was
to
see
was
evident
from
a
most
unusual
agitation
in
his
manner
huntington
he
got
out
somehow
taking
her
hand
and
staring
eagerly
down
into
her
face
i
heard
you
were
home
and
i
hoped
to
find
you
here
i
you
are
i
am
extremely
glad
half
an
hour
later
anthony
came
upon
his
wife
in
the
darkness
of
the
oh
you
should
have
left
them
when
i
was
away
she
said
little
tony
cried
out
and
i
had
to
go
i
know
rachel
does
want
to
be
left
with
him
angels
and
chaperons
defend
us
muttered
anthony
i
ca
stand
it
forever
to
feel
a
man
wanting
to
kill
me
for
staying
by
him
through
a
meeting
like
this
after
three
years
i
did
know
but
lockwood
would
attempt
to
throw
me
off
my
own
porch
give
him
a
chance
he
has
any
anyhow
it
after
nine
whispered
juliet
i
know
it
roger
taking
a
terrible
risk
he
does
know
she
here
but
i
thought
he
cared
enough
for
us
to
that
what
i
been
so
sure
of
he
probably
been
detained
by
some
case
he
getting
so
distinguished
the
minute
he
sets
foot
in
town
now
the
folks
with
things
the
matter
with
them
begin
to
block
his
path
i
hope
she
knows
what
she
throws
over
her
shoulder
if
she
refuses
him
now
i
do
see
that
she
going
to
have
a
chance
to
refuse
him
mourned
juliet
do
you
think
he
ever
forgive
us
if
we
let
him
get
away
without
knowing
she
was
here
lockwood
found
it
out
somehow
carey
safe
to
tell
him
if
he
sees
him
and
he
pretty
sure
to
at
roger
club
you
could
telephone
where
if
he
can
he
come
here
if
only
to
get
news
of
her
she
never
let
him
write
to
her
has
she
he
told
me
she
had
when
he
was
here
last
fall
and
she
did
know
where
he
was
whispered
anthony
we
give
fate
her
chance
if
she
bungles
the
game
we
take
it
into
our
own
hands
but
i
a
feeling
i
like
to
let
it
happen
by
itself
if
it
will
when
lockwood
had
gone
which
was
not
until
eleven
in
spite
of
the
way
his
hosts
remained
in
his
vicinity
rachel
stood
still
upon
the
porch
smiling
a
little
wearily
at
juliet
my
staying
all
night
has
been
settled
for
me
she
said
there
was
no
way
to
go
luckily
for
us
juliet
answered
sit
here
a
little
longer
dear
such
a
perfect
night
and
i
know
we
shall
see
little
enough
of
you
when
you
get
at
work
rachel
dropped
into
the
hammock
i
should
like
to
lie
here
all
night
she
said
and
watch
the
stars
until
i
go
to
sleep
i
done
that
so
many
many
nights
from
under
a
tent
flap
all
at
once
she
looked
up
her
eyes
widening
upon
the
porch
step
stood
a
strong
figure
as
unlike
lockwood
gracefully
slender
one
as
possible
a
man
eyes
were
gazing
steadily
down
into
hers
determined
gray
eyes
with
a
light
in
them
the
two
faces
were
plainly
visible
to
each
other
in
the
radiance
from
the
open
door
a
affair
if
she
had
not
been
standing
in
the
doorway
juliet
would
have
run
away
but
she
had
to
welcome
roger
barnes
a
traveler
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
almost
a
year
her
presence
however
after
one
glad
greeting
seemed
not
to
bother
him
much
he
turned
from
her
to
rachel
who
had
risen
and
took
her
outstretched
hand
in
both
his
it
been
rather
a
long
evening
he
said
wandering
around
and
around
this
place
waiting
for
the
other
man
to
go
i
explored
the
orchard
and
the
willow
path
and
every
familiar
haunt
i
had
to
refresh
myself
occasionally
by
stealing
up
for
a
glimpse
of
your
face
between
the
vines
but
somehow
that
only
made
it
harder
to
wait
i
had
to
march
myself
off
again
with
my
fists
gripped
tight
in
my
pockets
to
keep
them
off
that
fellow
eating
you
up
with
his
eyes
confound
him
you
who
belong
only
to
me
he
did
not
smile
as
he
said
the
last
words
but
stood
looking
eagerly
at
her
with
a
gaze
that
never
faltered
she
tried
to
draw
her
hands
away
it
was
useless
juliet
slipped
off
knowing
that
neither
of
them
would
see
her
go
come
down
on
the
lawn
with
me
he
said
but
she
resisted
please
stay
here
doctor
barnes
she
said
and
please
let
me
have
my
hand
i
ca
talk
so
you
need
talk
for
a
while
he
answered
he
sat
down
facing
her
at
six
i
found
out
you
were
here
at
eight
as
soon
as
i
could
get
away
i
came
out
i
told
you
how
i
spent
the
evening
if
i
had
needed
anything
to
sharpen
my
longing
for
you
that
would
have
done
it
but
i
think
i
had
reached
about
the
limit
of
what
i
could
bear
in
that
line
already
it
has
been
one
constant
augmenting
thirst
for
a
draught
that
was
out
of
my
reach
i
should
have
kept
my
promise
not
to
write
you
another
day
after
i
had
been
here
this
time
and
heard
what
i
have
heard
rachel
she
did
not
answer
her
face
was
turned
away
she
was
very
still
only
a
slightly
quickened
breathing
of
which
he
was
barely
conscious
betrayed
to
him
that
this
was
not
listening
of
an
ordinary
sort
i
should
have
said
anything
could
make
any
difference
with
my
feeling
to
strengthen
it
he
went
on
very
quietly
after
a
while
but
i
find
it
has
i
do
try
to
explain
it
to
myself
except
by
the
one
thing
i
am
sure
of
that
alexander
huntington
was
the
noblest
and
most
heroic
of
men
and
deserved
to
the
full
those
last
few
hours
of
knowledge
that
you
had
taken
his
name
and
i
can
understand
your
loyalty
to
him
in
wishing
to
wear
it
these
three
years
but
rachel
i
ca
let
you
wear
it
any
longer
she
turned
her
face
a
shade
farther
away
i
am
leaving
night
for
another
year
absence
he
spoke
as
simply
as
if
he
were
discussing
the
most
ordinary
of
subjects
so
i
can
see
but
one
thing
to
do
and
that
is
he
got
up
and
came
around
behind
her
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
vines
where
the
light
did
not
touch
him
and
that
is
to
take
you
with
me
he
had
not
said
it
doubtfully
although
his
inflection
was
very
gentle
she
moved
quickly
startled
doctor
barnes
yes
i
ready
for
them
you
ca
raise
an
objection
that
i
not
ready
for
not
one
that
i
ca
meet
except
one
and
that
you
ca
raise
rachel
she
was
silent
the
words
upon
her
lips
held
in
check
by
this
last
bold
declaration
you
see
you
ca
being
truthful
he
said
smiling
a
little
if
i
seem
too
confident
forgive
me
but
i
carried
with
me
all
these
years
that
one
look
when
you
forgot
to
veil
your
eyes
away
from
me
as
you
always
had
and
always
have
since
then
when
i
get
that
look
from
you
again
he
paused
drawing
a
long
breath
i
do
dare
dream
of
it
rachel
will
you
go
she
tried
to
glance
at
him
and
managed
it
but
no
higher
than
his
shoulders
i
am
engaged
to
take
the
training
for
nurses
at
the
larchmont
memorial
she
began
but
he
interrupted
her
joyfully
you
do
say
do
love
you
only
was
intending
to
be
a
nurse
i
told
you
you
could
say
it
because
it
is
true
you
do
love
me
rachel
tell
me
so
her
hurried
breathing
was
plainly
perceptible
now
she
rose
quickly
as
if
she
could
not
bear
the
telltale
lamplight
upon
her
face
any
longer
and
went
hurriedly
across
the
porch
and
down
upon
the
lawn
into
the
starlight
he
followed
her
his
pulses
bounding
oh
give
up
to
me
he
said
in
her
ear
his
own
breath
coming
fast
you
been
fighting
it
four
years
now
it
no
use
we
were
made
for
each
other
and
we
known
it
from
the
first
you
stood
heroically
by
your
first
promise
you
gave
him
all
you
could
but
that
all
over
you
do
have
to
be
true
to
anything
or
anybody
now
but
me
give
up
dear
and
let
me
know
what
it
feels
like
to
have
you
pull
a
man
toward
you
instead
of
pushing
him
away
they
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
orchard
in
deep
shadow
and
she
stopped
i
do
know
what
i
came
down
here
for
she
said
in
confusion
i
do
you
were
running
away
it
your
instinct
to
run
away
i
love
you
for
it
it
what
first
made
me
want
to
follow
but
i
ca
stand
your
running
away
much
longer
look
rachel
can
you
see
i
holding
out
my
arms
rachel
i
ca
wait
for
an
instant
longer
she
held
out
while
he
stood
silent
holding
himself
that
he
might
have
the
joy
of
receiving
her
surrender
then
all
at
once
he
realised
that
it
had
been
worth
all
his
days
of
patient
and
impatient
waiting
for
turning
to
him
at
last
she
gave
herself
with
the
abandon
such
natures
are
capable
of
showing
when
they
yield
after
long
resistance
into
the
arms
which
closed
hungrily
around
her
if
anybody
could
have
told
what
happened
during
the
next
hours
it
would
have
been
juliet
for
it
was
she
who
took
the
helm
of
affairs
she
lay
awake
half
the
night
or
what
there
was
left
of
it
after
the
doctor
had
come
back
with
rachel
and
told
his
friends
what
had
happened
and
what
was
yet
to
happen
planning
to
make
the
hasty
wedding
as
ideal
as
might
be
she
was
a
wonderful
planner
and
a
most
energetic
and
enthusiastic
young
matron
as
well
so
by
five
in
the
afternoon
she
had
accomplished
all
that
had
seemed
to
her
good
rachel
part
was
only
to
see
that
her
trunk
was
packed
her
explanations
offered
and
said
and
her
choice
made
of
several
exquisite
white
gowns
which
juliet
had
had
sent
out
from
town
but
i
ca
be
married
in
white
robeson
she
had
said
protestingly
when
juliet
had
opened
the
boxes
yes
you
can
and
must
this
is
your
only
bridal
dear
the
other
you
know
that
was
only
what
the
doctor
said
of
it
once
hand
in
his
to
the
last
the
hand
of
a
friend
but
this
is
this
different
rachel
had
turned
away
her
face
yes
this
is
different
she
had
owned
but
he
asked
me
to
beg
you
for
him
to
have
it
so
juliet
urged
and
rachel
was
silent
so
the
simplest
of
the
white
frocks
it
was
and
in
it
rachel
looked
as
juliet
had
meant
she
should
only
judith
and
wayne
carey
were
asked
down
to
see
them
married
to
humour
the
doctor
the
ceremony
was
performed
in
the
orchard
near
the
entrance
to
the
willow
path
the
time
afterward
was
short
and
before
she
knew
it
juliet
was
bidding
the
two
i
got
her
said
the
doctor
looking
from
juliet
to
rachel
who
stood
at
his
side
she
mine
all
mine
i
have
to
keep
saying
it
over
and
over
to
make
sure
for
your
comfort
answered
juliet
smiling
at
them
both
i
tell
you
that
she
looks
as
if
she
were
yours
does
she
he
cried
laughing
happily
how
does
she
look
he
turned
and
surveyed
her
she
looks
very
proud
and
sweet
and
still
she
always
been
those
things
and
very
beautiful
more
beautiful
than
ever
before
but
do
you
think
she
really
looks
as
if
she
were
mine
tell
me
how
juliet
turned
from
him
big
and
eager
like
a
boy
to
his
bride
proud
and
sweet
and
still
as
he
had
said
i
never
seen
rachel
look
absolutely
happy
before
she
told
him
there
always
been
a
bit
of
a
shadow
but
now
look
down
into
her
eyes
roger
there
no
shadow
there
now
but
when
he
would
have
looked
rachel
lashes
fell
not
yet
then
rachel
he
whispered
then
he
turned
to
juliet
and
anthony
who
had
come
up
to
stand
beside
her
if
it
had
been
for
you
and
your
this
day
would
never
have
come
for
me
he
said
you
have
been
good
friends
and
true
to
us
both
let
us
keep
you
so
and
juliet
proves
herself
still
indifferent
on
a
july
evening
a
month
later
cathcart
and
a
great
roll
of
paper
arrived
on
the
robeson
porch
for
an
hour
juliet
looked
and
listened
while
anthony
as
he
had
promised
said
not
a
word
to
bias
her
decision
cathcart
laid
before
her
plans
for
a
new
house
which
were
even
anthony
could
but
admit
to
himself
beyond
praise
from
every
standpoint
the
artistic
the
domestic
the
practical
even
the
economical
so
far
as
the
modern
architect
understands
the
meaning
of
the
word
the
plans
were
ideal
juliet
studied
them
absorbedly
showing
plainly
her
appreciation
of
them
it
would
be
a
beautiful
home
she
said
at
length
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
perfect
than
such
a
house
cathcart
looked
triumphant
without
glancing
at
anthony
he
produced
another
set
of
plans
just
to
please
myself
robeson
he
announced
i
have
spent
some
interesting
hours
in
trying
to
show
what
could
be
done
with
this
old
house
should
any
one
care
to
lay
out
a
reasonable
sum
upon
it
frankly
old
houses
never
repay
much
expenditure
of
money
yet
there
is
a
certain
satisfaction
in
working
out
the
details
of
restoration
and
improvement
which
makes
interesting
study
purely
as
a
matter
of
that
sort
i
have
fancied
such
extensions
as
these
he
laid
the
plans
before
her
juliet
looked
bent
over
them
cried
out
with
delight
and
called
upon
anthony
to
join
her
oh
cathcart
she
said
eagerly
before
you
proved
yourself
an
exceedingly
fine
architect
but
now
you
show
yourself
a
master
to
make
this
of
the
old
house
why
it
far
the
higher
art
anthony
glanced
laughing
across
at
cathcart
whose
face
had
fallen
so
pronouncedly
that
juliet
would
have
seen
it
if
she
had
been
observing
but
she
was
too
absorbed
in
the
new
plans
if
we
could
do
this
she
was
saying
it
would
satisfy
my
best
ideals
of
a
permanent
home
but
my
dear
robeson
stammered
the
man
of
castles
consider
the
location
the
neighbourhood
the
rural
character
of
the
surroundings
i
do
she
answered
still
studying
the
plans
i
love
them
all
and
the
old
home
most
of
all
ever
since
i
knew
how
had
she
known
they
wondered
that
a
change
of
houses
was
a
possible
thing
for
us
i
have
been
homesick
in
anticipation
of
a
change
i
could
bear
to
think
of
yet
i
wondered
if
we
ought
to
go
but
if
you
can
make
this
of
the
old
home
she
lifted
to
her
husband
an
enthusiastic
face
his
eyes
met
hers
in
a
long
look
in
which
each
read
deep
into
the
mind
of
the
other
then
anthony
robeson
like
a
man
who
hears
precisely
what
he
most
wants
to
hear
turned
smiling
to
cathcart
i
think
you
lost

it
is
the
spirit
of
the

one
can
by
it
perhaps
the
better
understand
why
men

women
too
willingly

every
privation
