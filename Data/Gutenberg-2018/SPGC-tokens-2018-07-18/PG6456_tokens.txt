behold
human
beings
living
in
a
sort
of
underground
den
which
has
a
mouth
open
towards
the
light
and
reaching
all
across
the
den
they
have
been
here
from
their
childhood
and
have
their
legs
and
necks
chained
so
that
they
can
not
move
and
can
only
see
before
them
for
the
chains
are
arranged
in
such
a
manner
as
to
prevent
them
from
turning
round
their
heads
at
a
distance
above
and
behind
them
the
light
of
a
fire
is
blazing
and
between
the
fire
and
the
prisoners
there
is
a
raised
way
and
you
will
see
if
you
look
a
low
wall
built
along
the
way
like
the
screen
which
marionette
players
have
before
them
over
which
they
show
the
puppets
i
see
he
said
and
do
you
see
i
said
men
passing
along
the
wall
carrying
vessels
which
appear
over
the
wall
also
figures
of
men
and
animals
made
of
wood
and
stone
and
various
materials
and
some
of
the
prisoners
as
you
would
expect
are
talking
and
some
of
them
are
silent
this
is
a
strange
image
he
said
and
they
are
strange
prisoners
like
ourselves
i
replied
and
they
see
only
their
own
shadows
or
the
shadows
of
one
another
which
the
fire
throws
on
the
opposite
wall
of
the
cave
true
he
said
how
could
they
see
anything
but
the
shadows
if
they
were
never
allowed
to
move
their
heads
and
of
the
objects
which
are
being
carried
in
like
manner
they
would
see
only
the
shadows
yes
he
said
and
if
they
were
able
to
talk
with
one
another
would
they
not
suppose
that
they
were

was

chapter
i
introduction
the
world
outside
and
the
pictures
in
our
heads
there
is
an
island
in
the
ocean
where
in
a
few
englishmen
frenchmen
and
germans
lived
no
cable
reaches
that
island
and
the
british
mail
steamer
comes
but
once
in
sixty
days
in
september
it
had
not
yet
come
and
the
islanders
were
still
talking
about
the
latest
newspaper
which
told
about
the
approaching
trial
of
madame
caillaux
for
the
shooting
of
gaston
calmette
it
was
therefore
with
more
than
usual
eagerness
that
the
whole
colony
assembled
at
the
quay
on
a
day
in
to
hear
from
the
captain
what
the
verdict
had
been
they
learned
that
for
over
six
weeks
now
those
of
them
who
were
english
and
those
of
them
who
were
french
had
been
fighting
in
behalf
of
the
sanctity
of
treaties
against
those
of
them
who
were
germans
for
six
strange
weeks
they
had
acted
as
if
they
were
friends
when
in
fact
they
were
enemies
but
their
plight
was
not
so
different
from
that
of
most
of
the
population
of
europe
they
had
been
mistaken
for
six
weeks
on
the
continent
the
interval
may
have
been
only
six
days
or
six
hours
there
was
an
interval
there
was
a
moment
when
the
picture
of
europe
on
which
men
were
conducting
their
business
as
usual
did
not
in
any
way
correspond
to
the
europe
which
was
about
to
make
a
jumble
of
their
lives
there
was
a
time
for
each
man
when
he
was
still
adjusted
to
an
environment
that
no
longer
existed
all
over
the
world
as
late
as
july
men
were
making
goods
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
ship
buying
goods
they
would
not
be
able
to
import
careers
were
being
planned
enterprises
contemplated
hopes
and
expectations
entertained
all
in
the
belief
that
the
world
as
known
was
the
world
as
it
was
men
were
writing
books
describing
that
world
they
trusted
the
picture
in
their
heads
and
then
over
four
years
later
on
a
thursday
morning
came
the
news
of
an
armistice
and
people
gave
vent
to
their
unutterable
relief
that
the
slaughter
was
over
yet
in
the
five
days
before
the
real
armistice
came
though
the
end
of
the
war
had
been
celebrated
several
thousand
young
men
died
on
the
battlefields
looking
back
we
can
see
how
indirectly
we
know
the
environment
in
which
nevertheless
we
live
we
can
see
that
the
news
of
it
comes
to
us
now
fast
now
slowly
but
that
whatever
we
believe
to
be
a
true
picture
we
treat
as
if
it
were
the
environment
itself
it
is
harder
to
remember
that
about
the
beliefs
upon
which
we
are
now
acting
but
in
respect
to
other
peoples
and
other
ages
we
flatter
ourselves
that
it
is
easy
to
see
when
they
were
in
deadly
earnest
about
ludicrous
pictures
of
the
world
we
insist
because
of
our
superior
hindsight
that
the
world
as
they
needed
to
know
it
and
the
world
as
they
did
know
it
were
often
two
quite
contradictory
things
we
can
see
too
that
while
they
governed
and
fought
traded
and
reformed
in
the
world
as
they
imagined
it
to
be
they
produced
results
or
failed
to
produce
any
in
the
world
as
it
was
they
started
for
the
indies
and
found
america
they
diagnosed
evil
and
hanged
old
women
they
thought
they
could
grow
rich

always
selling
and
never
buying

why
then
argue
whether
he
hung
it
up
in
air
or
upon
the
water
and
raise
a
controversy
as
to
how
the
thin
air
could
sustain
the
earth
or
why
if
upon
the
waters
the
earth
does
not
go
crashing
down
to
the
bottom
not
because
the
earth
is
in
the
middle
as
if
suspended
on
even
balance
but
because
the
majesty
of
god
constrains
it
by
the
law
of
his
will
does
it
endure

unstable
and

scripture

why

but
a
century
and
a
half
after
ambrose
opinion
was
still
troubled
on
this
occasion
by
the
problem
of
the
antipodes
a
monk
named
cosmas
famous
for
his
scientific
attainments
was
therefore
deputed
to
write
a
christian
topography
or
christian
opinion
concerning
the
world
footnote
lecky
in
vol
i
pp
it
is
clear
that
he
knew
exactly
what
was
expected
of
him
for
he
based
all
his
conclusions
on
the
scriptures
as
he
read
them
it
appears
then
that
the
world
is
a
flat
parallelogram
twice
as
broad
from
east
to
west
as
it
is
long
from
north
to
in
the
center
is
the
earth
surrounded
by
ocean
which
is
in
turn
surrounded
by
another
earth
where
men
lived
before
the
deluge
this
other
earth
was
noah
port
of
embarkation
in
the
north
is
a
high
conical
mountain
around
which
revolve
the
sun
and
moon
when
the
sun
is
behind
the
mountain
it
is
night
the
sky
is
glued
to
the
edges
of
the
outer
earth
it
consists
of
four
high
walls
which
meet
in
a
concave
roof
so
that
the
earth
is
the
floor
of
the
universe
there
is
an
ocean
on
the
other
side
of
the
sky
constituting
the
waters
that
are
above
the
firmament
the
space
between
the
celestial
ocean
and
the
ultimate
roof
of
the
universe
belongs
to
the
blest
the
space
between
the
earth
and
sky
is
inhabited
by
the
angels
finally
since
paul
said
that
all
men
are
made
to
live
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
how
could
they
live
on
the
back
where
the
antipodes
are
supposed
to
be
with
such
a
passage
before
his
eyes
a
christian
we
are
told
should
not
speak
of
the
antipodes
footnote
far
less
should
he
go
to
the
antipodes
nor
should
any
christian
prince
give
him
a
ship
to
try
nor
would
any
pious
mariner
wish
to
try
for
cosmas
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
absurd
about
his
map
only
by
remembering
his
absolute
conviction
that
this
was
the
map
of
the
universe
can
we
begin
to
understand
how
he
would
have
dreaded
magellan
or
peary
or
the
aviator
who
risked
a
collision
with
the
angels
and
the
vault
of
heaven
by
flying
seven
miles
up
in
the
air
in
the
same
way
we
can
best
understand
the
furies
of
war
and
politics
by
remembering
that
almost
the
whole
of
each
party
believes
absolutely
in
its
picture
of
the
opposition
that
it
takes
as
fact
not
what
is
but
what
it
supposes
to
be
the
fact
and
that
therefore
like
hamlet
it
will
stab
polonius
behind
the
rustling
curtain
thinking
him
the
king
and
perhaps
like
hamlet
add
thou
wretched
rash
intruding
fool
farewell
i
took
thee
for
thy
better
take
thy
fortune
great
men
even
during
their
lifetime
are
usually
known
to
the
public
only
through
a
fictitious
personality
hence
the
modicum
of
truth
in
the
old
saying
that
no
man
is
a
hero
to
his
valet
there
is
only
a
modicum
of
truth
for
the
valet
and
the
private
secretary
are
often
immersed
in
the
fiction
themselves
royal
personages
are
of
course
constructed
personalities
whether
they
themselves
believe
in
their
public
character
or
whether
they
merely
permit
the
chamberlain
to
it
there
are
at
least
two
distinct
selves
the
public
and
regal
self
the
private
and
human
the
biographies
of
great
people
fall
more
or
less
readily
into
the
histories
of
these
two
selves
the
official
biographer
reproduces
the
public
life
the
revealing
memoir
the
other
the
charnwood
lincoln
for
example
is
a
noble
portrait
not
of
an
actual
human
being
but
of
an
epic
figure
replete
with
significance
who
moves
on
much
the
same
level
of
reality
as
aeneas
or
george
oliver
hamilton
is
a
majestic
abstraction
the
sculpture
of
an
idea
an
essay
as
oliver
himself
calls
it
on
american
union
it
is
a
formal
monument
to
the
of
federalism
hardly
the
biography
of
a
person
sometimes
people
create
their
own
facade
when
they
think
they
are
revealing
the
interior
scene
the
repington
diaries
and
margot
asquith
are
a
species
of
in
which
the
intimate
detail
is
most
revealing
as
an
index
of
how
the
authors
like
to
think
about
themselves
but
the
most
interesting
kind
of
portraiture
is
that
which
arises
spontaneously
in
people
minds
when
victoria
came
to
the
throne
says
strachey
footnote
lytton
strachey
p
among
the
outside
public
there
was
a
great
wave
of
enthusiasm
sentiment
and
romance
were
coming
into
fashion
and
the
spectacle
of
the
little
innocent
modest
with
fair
hair
and
pink
cheeks
driving
through
her
capital
filled
the
hearts
of
the
beholders
with
raptures
of
affectionate
loyalty
what
above
all
struck
everybody
with
overwhelming
force
was
the
contrast
between
queen
victoria
and
her
uncles
the
nasty
old
men
debauched
and
selfish
pigheaded
and
ridiculous
with
their
perpetual
burden
of
debts
confusions
and
disreputabilities
they
had
vanished

greatest

of
the
boxes
of
the
packages
and

which
unknown
people
sent
him
with
a
frantic
testimonial
of
their
admiration
i
think
that
outside
of
general
joffre
no
commander
in
the

has
been
able
to
realize
a
comparable
idea
of
what
glory
is

i
have
known
a
hairdresser
who
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
make
a
portrait
of
the
general
out
of
hair
belonging
to
persons
who
were
dear
to
him
a
professional
penman
had
the
same
idea
but
the
features
were
composed
of
thousands
of
little
phrases
in
tiny
characters
which
sang
the
praise
of
the
general
as
to
letters
he
had
them
in
all
scripts
from
all
countries
written
in
every
dialect
affectionate
letters
grateful
overflowing
with
love
filled
with
adoration
they
called
him
savior
of
the
world
father
of
his
country
agent
of
god
benefactor
of
humanity
etc
and
not
only
frenchmen
but
americans
argentinians
australians
etc
etc
thousands
of
little
children
without
their
parents
knowledge
took
pen
in
hand
and
wrote
to
tell
him
their
love
most
of
them
called
him
our
father
and
there
was
poignancy
about
their
effusions
their
adoration
these
sighs
of
deliverance
that
escaped
from
thousands
of
hearts
at
the
defeat
of
barbarism
to
all
these
naif
little
souls
joffre
seemed
like
george
crushing
the
dragon
certainly
he
incarnated
for
the
conscience
of
mankind
the
victory
of
good
over
evil
of
light
over
darkness
lunatics
simpletons
the
and
the
crazy
turned
their
darkened
brains
toward
him
as
toward
reason
itself
i
have
read
the
letter
of
a
person
living
in
sydney
who
begged
the
general
to
save
him
from
his
enemies
another
a
new
zealander
requested
him
to
send
some
soldiers
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
who
owed
him
ten
pounds
and
would
not
pay
finally
some
hundreds
of
young
girls
overcoming
the
timidity
of
their
sex
asked
for
engagements
their
families
not
to
know
about
it
others
wished
only
to
serve
him
this
ideal
joffre
was
compounded
out
of
the
victory
won
by
him
his
staff
and
his
troops
the
despair
of
the
war
the
personal
sorrows
and
the
hope
of
future
victory
but
beside
there
is
the
exorcism
of
devils
by
the
same
mechanism
through
which
heroes
are
incarnated
devils
are
made
if
everything
good
was
to
come
from
joffre
foch
wilson
or
roosevelt
everything
evil
originated
in
the
kaiser
wilhelm
lenin
and
trotsky
they
were
as
omnipotent
for
evil
as
the
heroes
were
omnipotent
for
good
to
many
simple
and
frightened
minds
there
was
no
political
reverse
no
strike
no
obstruction
no
mysterious
death
or
mysterious
conflagration
anywhere
in
the
world
of
which
the
causes
did
not
wind
back
to
these
personal
sources
of
evil
worldwide
concentration
of
this
kind
on
a
symbolic
personality
is
rare
enough
to
be
clearly
remarkable
and
every
author
has
a
weakness
for
the
striking
and
irrefutable
example
the
vivisection
of
war
reveals
such
examples
but
it
does
not
make
them
out
of
nothing
in
a
more
normal
public
life
symbolic
pictures
are
no
less
governant
of
behavior
but
each
symbol
is
far
less
inclusive
because
there
are
so
many
competing
ones
not
only
is
each
symbol
charged
with
less
feeling
because
at
most
it
represents
only
a
part
of
the
population
but
even
within
that
part
there
is
infinitely
less
suppression
of
individual
difference
the
symbols
of
public
opinion
in
times
of
moderate
security
are
subject
to
check
and
comparison
and
argument
they
come
and
go
coalesce
and
are
forgotten
never
organizing
perfectly
the
emotion
of
the
whole
group
there
is
after
all
just
one
human
activity
left
in
which
whole
populations
accomplish
the
union
sacrée
it
occurs
in
those
middle
phases
of
a
war
when
fear
pugnacity
and
hatred
have
secured
complete
dominion
of
the
spirit
either
to
crush
every
other
instinct
or
to
enlist
it
and
before
weariness
is
felt
at
almost
all
other
times
and
even
in
war
when
it
is
deadlocked
a
sufficiently
greater
range
of
feelings
is
aroused
to
establish
conflict
choice
hesitation
and
compromise
the
symbolism
of
public
opinion
usually
bears
as
we
shall
see
footnote
part
the
marks
of
this
balancing
of
interest
think
for
example
of
how
rapidly
after
the
armistice
the
precarious
and
by
no
means
successfully
established
symbol
of
allied
unity
disappeared
how
it
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
breakdown
of
each
nation
symbolic
picture
of
the
other
britain
the
defender
of
public
law
france
watching
at
the
frontier
of
freedom
america
the
crusader
and
think
then
of
how
within
each
nation
the
symbolic
picture
of
itself
frayed
out
as
party
and
class
conflict
and
personal
ambition
began
to
stir
postponed
issues
and
then
of
how
the
symbolic
pictures
of
the
leaders
gave
way
as
one
by
one
wilson
clemenceau
lloyd
george
ceased
to
be
the
incarnation
of
human
hope
and
became
merely
the
negotiators
and
administrators
for
a
disillusioned
world
whether
we
regret
this
as
one
of
the
soft
evils
of
peace
or
applaud
it
as
a
return
to
sanity
is
obviously
no
matter
here
our
first
concern
with
fictions
and
symbols
is
to
forget
their
value
to
the
existing
social
order
and
to
think
of
them
simply
as
an
important
part
of
the
machinery
of
human
communication
now
in
any
society
that
is
not
completely
in
its
interests
and
so
small
that
everyone
can
know
all
about
everything
that
happens
ideas
deal
with
events
that
are
out
of
sight
and
hard
to
grasp

is
aware
that
a
war
is
raging
in

and
tries
to
conceive
it
she

certainly
she
has
never
been

is
now
the

it

no

can
imagine
them

the

do
not

as

two

miss

has
no

so
if

about

she
fastens
upon

the
kaiser
as
if
they
were
engaged
in
a
personal
duel
perhaps
if
you
could
see
what
she
sees
with
her

the
image
in

might
be
not

an
eighteenth

with
a
shadowy
army

of
a

the
general
was
in
his
middle
class
office
before
the
worktable
without
papers
where
he
sat
down
to
write
his
signature
suddenly
it
was
noticed
that
there
were
no
maps
on
the
walls
but
since
according
to
popular
ideas
it
is
not
possible
to
think
of
a
general
without
maps
a

were
placed
in

for
the
picture
and

the
only
feeling
that
anyone
can
have
about
an
event
he
does
not
experience
is
the
feeling
aroused
by
his
mental
image
of
that
event
that
is
why
until
we
know
what
others
think
they
know
we
can
not
truly
understand
their
acts
i
have
seen
a
young
girl
brought
up
in
a
pennsylvania
mining
town
plunged
suddenly
from
entire
cheerfulness
into
a
paroxysm
of
grief
when
a
gust
of
wind
cracked
the
kitchen
for
hours
she
was
inconsolable
and
to
me
incomprehensible
but
when
she
was
able
to
talk
it
transpired
that
if
a
broke
it
meant
that
a
close
relative
had
died
she
was
therefore
mourning
for
her
father
who
had
frightened
her
into
running
away
from
home
the
father
was
of
course
quite
thoroughly
alive
as
a
telegraphic
inquiry
soon
proved
but
until
the
telegram
came
the
cracked
glass
was
an
authentic
message
to
that
girl
why
it
was
authentic
only
a
prolonged
investigation
by
a
skilled
psychiatrist
could
show
but
even
the
most
casual
observer
could
see
that
the
girl
enormously
upset
by
her
family
troubles
had
hallucinated
a
complete
fiction
out
of
one
external
fact
a
remembered
superstition
and
a
turmoil
of
remorse
and
fear
and
love
for
her
father
abnormality
in
these
instances
is
only
a
matter
of
degree
when
an
who
has
been
frightened
by
a
bomb
exploded
on
his
doorstep
convinces
himself
by
the
reading
of
revolutionary
literature
that
a
revolution
is
to
happen
on
the
first
of
may
we
recognize
that
much
the
same
mechanism
is
at
work
the
war
of
course
furnished
many
examples
of
this
pattern
the
casual
fact
the
creative
imagination
the
will
to
believe
and
out
of
these
three
elements
a
counterfeit
of
reality
to
which
there
was
a
violent
instinctive
response
for
it
is
clear
enough
that
under
certain
conditions
men
respond
as
powerfully
to
fictions
as
they
do
to
realities
and
that
in
many
cases
they
help
to
create
the
very
fictions
to
which
they
respond
let
him
cast
the
first
stone
who
did
not
believe
in
the
russian
army
that
passed
through
england
in
august
did
not
accept
any
tale
of
atrocities
without
direct
proof
and
never
saw
a
plot
a
traitor
or
a
spy
where
there
was
none
let
him
cast
a
stone
who
never
passed
on
as
the
real
inside
truth
what
he
had
heard
someone
say
who
knew
no
more
than
he
did
in
all
these
instances
we
must
note
particularly
one
common
factor
it
is
the
insertion
between
man
and
his
environment
of
a
to
that
his
behavior
is
a
response
but
because
it
behavior
the
consequences
if
they
are
acts
operate
not
in
the
where
the
behavior
is
stimulated
but
in
the
real
environment
where
action
eventuates
if
the
behavior
is
not
a
practical
act
but
what
we
call
roughly
thought
and
emotion
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
there
is
any
noticeable
break
in
the
texture
of
the
fictitious
world
but
when
the
stimulus
of
the
results
in
action
on
things
or
other
people
contradiction
soon
develops
then
comes
the
sensation
of
butting
one
head
against
a
stone
wall
of
learning
by
experience
and
witnessing
herbert
spencer
tragedy
of
the
murder
of
a
beautiful
theory
by
a
gang
of
brutal
facts
the
discomfort
in
short
of
a
maladjustment
for
certainly
at
the
level
of
social
life
what
is
called
the
adjustment
of
man
to
his

through
the

not
mean

i
mean
a
representation
of
the
environment
which
is
in
lesser
or
greater
degree
made
by
man
himself
the
range
of
fiction
extends
all
the
way
from
complete
hallucination
to
the
scientists
perfectly
use
of
a
schematic
model
or
his
decision
that
for
his
particular
problem
accuracy
beyond
a
certain
number
of
decimal
places
is
not
important
a
work
of
fiction
may
have
almost
any
degree
of
fidelity
and
so
long
as
the
degree
of
fidelity
can
be
taken
into
account
fiction
is
not
misleading
in
fact
human
culture
is
very
largely
the
selection
the
rearrangement
the
tracing
of
patterns
upon
and
the
stylizing
of
what
william
james
called
the
random
irradiations
and
resettlements
of
our
ideas
footnote
james
of
vol
ii
the
alternative
to
the
use
of
fictions
is
direct
exposure
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
sensation
that
is
not
a
real
alternative
for
however
refreshing
it
is
to
see
at
times
with
a
perfectly
innocent
eye
innocence
itself
is
not
wisdom
though
a
source
and
corrective
of
wisdom
for
the
real
environment
is
altogether
too
big
too
complex
and
too
fleeting
for
direct
acquaintance
we
are
not
equipped
to
deal
with
so
much
subtlety
so
much
variety
so
many
permutations
and
combinations
and
although
we
have
to
act
in
that
environment
we
have
to
reconstruct
it
on
a
simpler
model
before
we
can
manage
with
it
to
traverse
the
world
men
must
have
maps
of
the
world
their
persistent
difficulty
is
to
secure
maps
on
which
their
own
need
or
someone
else
need
has
not
sketched
in
the
coast
of
bohemia
the
analyst
of
public
opinion
must
begin
then
by
recognizing
the
triangular
relationship
between
the
scene
of
action
the
human
picture
of
that
scene
and
the
human
response
to
that
picture
working
itself
out
upon
the
scene
of
action
it
is
like
a
play
suggested
to
the
actors
by
their
own
experience
in
which
the
plot
is
transacted
in
the
real
lives
of
the
actors
and
not
merely
in
their
stage
parts
the
moving
picture
often
emphasizes
with
great
skill
this
double
drama
of
interior
motive
and
external
behavior
two
men
are
quarreling
ostensibly
about
some
money
but
their
passion
is
inexplicable
then
the
picture
fades
out
and
what
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
men
sees
with
his
mind
eye
is
reënacted
across
the
table
they
were
quarreling
about
money
in
memory
they
are
back
in
their
youth
when
the
girl
jilted
him
for
the
other
man
the
exterior
drama
is
explained
the
hero
is
not
greedy
the
hero
is
in
love
a
scene
not
so
different
was
played
in
the
united
states
senate
at
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
september
some
of
the
senators
read
a
news
dispatch
in
the
about
the
landing
of
american
marines
on
the
dalmatian
coast
the
newspaper
said
facts
now
established
the
following
important
facts
appear
already
the
orders
to
rear
admiral
andrews
commanding
the
american
naval
forces
in
the
adriatic
came
from
the
british
admiralty
via
the
war
council
and
rear
admiral
knapps
in
london
the
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
american
navy
department
was
not
asked
without
daniels
knowledge
daniels
was
admittedly
placed
in
a
peculiar
position
when
cables
reached
here
stating
that
the
forces
over
which
he
is
presumed
to
have
exclusive
control
were
carrying
on
what
amounted
to
naval
warfare
without
his
knowledge
it
was
fully
realized
that
the
admiralty
might
desire
to
issue
orders
to
rear
admiral
to
act
on
behalf
of
great
britain
and
her
allies
because
the
situation
required
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
some
nation
if
followers
were
to
be
held
in
check
it
was
further
realized
that
the
new
league
of
nations
plan
foreigners
would
be
in
a
position
to
direct
american
naval
forces
in
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
american
navy
department
etc
italics
mine
the
first
senator
to
comment
is
knox
of
pennsylvania
indignantly
he
demands
investigation
in
brandegee
of
connecticut
who
spoke
next
indignation
has
already
stimulated
credulity
where
knox
indignantly
wishes
to
know
if
the
report
is
true
brandegee
a
half
a
minute
later
would
like
to
know
what
would
have
happened
if
marines
had
been
killed
knox
interested
in
the
question
forgets
that
he
asked
for
an
inquiry
and
replies
if
american
marines
had
been
killed
it
would
be
war
the
mood
of
the
debate
is
still
conditional
debate
proceeds
mccormick
of
illinois
reminds
the
senate
that
the
wilson
administration
is
prone
to
the
waging
of
small
unauthorized
wars
he
repeats
theodore
roosevelt
quip
about
waging
peace
more
debate
brandegee
notes
that
the
marines
acted
under
orders
of
a
supreme
council
sitting
somewhere
but
he
can
not
recall
who
represents
the
united
states
on
that
body
the
supreme
council
is
unknown
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
therefore
new
of
indiana
submits
a
resolution
calling
for
the
facts
so
far
the
senators
still
recognize
vaguely
that
they
are
discussing
a
rumor
being
lawyers
they
still
remember
some
of
the
forms
of
evidence
but
as
men
they
already
experience
all
the
indignation
which
is
appropriate
to
the
fact
that
american
marines
have
been
ordered
into
war
by
a
foreign
government
and
without
the
consent
of
congress
emotionally
they
want
to
believe
it
because
they
are
republicans
fighting
the
league
of
nations
this
arouses
the
democratic
leader
hitchcock
of
nebraska
he
defends
the
supreme
council
it
was
acting
under
the
war
powers
peace
has
not
yet
been
concluded
because
the
republicans
are
delaying
it
therefore
the
action
was
necessary
and
legal
both
sides
now
assume
that
the
report
is
true
and
the
conclusions
they
draw
are
the
conclusions
of
their
partisanship
yet
this
extraordinary
assumption
is
in
a
debate
over
a
resolution
to
investigate
the
truth
of
the
assumption
it
reveals
how
difficult
it
is
even
for
trained
lawyers
to
suspend
response
until
the
returns
are
in
the
response
is
instantaneous
the
fiction
is
taken
for
truth
because
the
fiction
is
badly
needed
a
few
days
later
an
official
report
showed
that
the
marines
were
not
landed
by
order
of
the
british
government
or
of
the
supreme
council
they
had
not
been
fighting
the
italians
they
had
been
landed
at
the
request
of
the
italian
government
to
protect
italians
and
the
american
commander
had
been
officially
thanked
by
the
italian
authorities
the
marines
were
not
at
war
with
italy
they
had
acted
according
to
an
established
international
practice
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
league
of
nations
the
scene
of
action
was
the
adriatic
the
picture
of
that
scene
in
the
senators
heads
at
washington
was
furnished
in
this
case
probably
with
intent
to
deceive
by
a
man
who
cared
nothing
about
the
adriatic
but
much
about
defeating
the
league
to
this
picture
the
senate
responded
by
a
strengthening
of
its
partisan
differences
over
the
league
whether
in
this
particular
case
the
senate
was
above
or
below
its
normal
standard
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
nor
whether
the
senate
compares
favorably
with
the
house
or
with
other
parliaments
at
the
moment
i
should
like
to
think
only
about
the
spectacle
of
men
acting
upon
their
environment
moved
by
stimuli
from
their
for
when
full
allowance
has
been
made
for
deliberate
fraud
political
science
has
still
to
account
for
such
facts
as
two
nations
attacking
one
another
each
convinced
that
it
is
acting
in
or
two
classes
at
war
each
certain
that
it
speaks
for
the
common
interest
they
live
we
are
likely
to
say
in
different
worlds
more
accurately
they
live
in
the
same
world
but
they
think
and
feel
in
different
ones
it
is
to
these
special
worlds
it
is
to
these
private
or
group
or
class
or
provincial
or
occupational
or
national
or
sectarian
artifacts
that
the
political
adjustment
of
mankind
in
the
great
society
takes
place
their
variety
and
complication
are
impossible
to
describe
yet
these
fictions
determine
a
very
great
part
of
political
behavior
we
must
think
of
perhaps
fifty
sovereign
parliaments
consisting
of
at
least
a
hundred
legislative
bodies
with
them
belong
at
least
fifty
hierarchies
of
provincial
and
municipal
assemblies
which
with
their
executive
administrative
and
legislative
organs
constitute
formal
authority
on
earth
but
that
does
not
begin
to
reveal
the
complexity
of
political
life
for
in
each
of
these
innumerable
centers
of
authority
there
are
parties
and
these
parties
are
themselves
hierarchies
with
their
roots
in
classes
sections
cliques
and
clans
and
within
these
are
the
individual
politicians
each
the
personal
center
of
a
web

next

may
be

scientist
and
regard
his

as
somehow
rather
less

than
his

he
may
come
almost
to
regard
his
own

the

is
the

are
undoubtedly
names
for

work

no
statement

explain

that
their
their

are
a

in

were

that
except
for

nine
months

existence

human
being
manages
its
affairs
as
well
as
a
plant
the
chief
difficulty
in
adapting
the
psychoanalytic
scheme
to
political
thought
arises
in
this
connection
the
freudians
are
concerned
with
the
maladjustment
of
distinct
individuals
to
other
individuals
and
to
concrete
circumstances
they
have
assumed
that
if
internal
derangements
could
be
straightened
out
there
would
be
little
or
no
confusion
about
what
is
the
obviously
normal
relationship
but
public
opinion
deals
with
indirect
unseen
and
puzzling
facts
and
there
is
nothing
obvious
about
them
the
situations
to
which
public
opinions
refer
are
known
only
as
opinions
the
psychoanalyst
on
the
other
hand
almost
always
assumes
that
the
environment
is
knowable
and
if
not
knowable
then
at
least
bearable
to
any
unclouded
intelligence
this
assumption
of
his
is
the
problem
of
public
opinion
instead
of
taking
for
granted
an
environment
that
is
readily
known
the
social
analyst
is
most
concerned
in
studying
how
the
larger
political
environment
is
conceived
and
how
it
can
be
conceived
more
successfully
the
psychoanalyst
examines
the
adjustment
to
an
x
called
by
him
the
environment
the
social
analyst
examines
the
x
called
by
him
the
he
is
of
course
permanently
and
constantly
in
debt
to
the
new
psychology
not
only
because
when
rightly
applied
it
so
greatly
helps
people
to
stand
on
their
own
feet
come
what
may
but
because
the
study
of
dreams
fantasy
and
rationalization
has
thrown
light
on
how
the
is
put
together
but
he
can
not
assume
as
his
criterion
either
what
is
called
a
normal
biological
career

the

what
for
a
sociologist
is
a
normal
social
career
or
one
freed
from
suppressions
and

conservative
critics
do
to
be
sure
assume
the
first
and
romantic
ones
the
second
but
in
assuming
them
they
are
taking
the
whole
world
for
granted
they
are
saying
in
effect
either
that
society
is
the
sort
of
thing
which
corresponds
to
their
idea
of
what
is
normal
or
the
sort
of
thing
which
corresponds
to
their
idea
of
what
is
free
both
ideas
are
merely
public
opinions
and
while
the
psychoanalyst
as
physician
may
perhaps
assume
them
the
sociologist
may
not
take
the
products
of
existing
public
opinion
as
criteria
by
which
to
study
public
opinion
the
world
that
we
have
to
deal

is
out

it
has
to
be
explored

imagined
man
is
no
aristotelian
god
contemplating
all
existence
at
one
glance
he
is
the
creature
of
an
evolution
who
can
just
about
span
a
sufficient
portion
of
reality
to
manage
his
survival
and
snatch
what
on
the
scale
of
time
are
but
a
few
moments
of
insight
and
happiness
yet
this
same
creature
has
invented
ways
of
seeing
what
no
naked
eye
could
see
of
hearing
what
no
ear
could
hear
of
weighing
immense
masses
and
infinitesimal
ones
of
counting
and
separating
more
items
than
he
can
individually
remember
he
is
learning
to
see
with
his
mind
vast
portions
of
the
world
that
he
could
never
see
touch
smell
hear
or
remember
gradually
he
makes
for
himself
a
trustworthy
picture
inside
his
head
of
the
world
beyond
his
reach
those
features
of
the
world
outside
which
have
to
do
with
the
behavior
of
other
human
beings
in
so
far
as
that
behavior
crosses
ours
is
dependent
upon
us
or
is
interesting
to
us
we
call
roughly
public
affairs
the
pictures
inside
the
heads
of
these
human
beings
the
pictures
of
themselves
of
others
of
their
needs
purposes
and
relationship
are
their
public
opinions
those
pictures
which
are
acted
upon
by
groups
of
people
or
by
individuals
acting
in
the
name
of
groups
are
public
opinion
with
capital
letters
and
so
in
the
chapters
which
follow
we
shall
inquire
first
into
some
of
the
reasons
why
the
picture
inside
so
often
misleads
men
in
their
dealings
with
the
world
outside
under
this
heading
we
shall
consider
first
the
chief
factors
which
limit
their
access
to
the
facts
they
are
the
artificial
censorships
the
limitations
of
social
contact
the
comparatively
meager
time
available
in
each
day
for
paying
attention
to
public
affairs
the
distortion
arising
because
events
have
to
be
compressed
into
very
short
messages
the
difficulty
of
making
a
small
vocabulary
express
a
complicated
world
and
finally
the
fear
of
facing
those
facts
which
would
seem
to
threaten
the
established
routine
of
men
lives
the
analysis
then
turns
from
these
more
or
less
external
limitations
to
the
question
of
how
this
trickle
of
messages
from
the
outside
is
affected
by
the
stored
up
images
the
preconceptions
and
prejudices
which
interpret
fill
them
out
and
in
their
turn
powerfully
direct
the
play
of
our
attention
and
our
vision
itself
from
this
it
proceeds
to
examine
how
in
the
individual
person
the
limited
messages
from
outside
formed
into
a
pattern
of
stereotypes
are
identified
with
his
own
interests
as
he
feels
and
conceives
them
in
the
succeeding
sections
it
examines
how
opinions
are
crystallized
into
what
is
called
public
opinion
how
a
national
will
a
group
mind
a
social
purpose
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
is
formed
the
first
five
parts
constitute
the
descriptive
section
of
the
book
there
follows
an
analysis
of
the
traditional
democratic
theory
of
public
opinion
the
substance
of
the
argument
is
that
democracy
in
its
original
form
never
seriously
faced
the
problem
which
arises
because
the
pictures
inside
people
heads
do
not
automatically
correspond
with
the
world
outside
and
then
because
the
democratic
theory
is
under
criticism
by
socialist
thinkers
there
follows
an
examination
of
the
most
advanced
and
coherent
of
these
criticisms
as
made
by
the
english
guild
socialists
my
purpose
here
is
to
find
out
whether
these
reformers
take
into
account
the
main
difficulties
of
public
opinion
my
conclusion
is
that
they
ignore
the
difficulties
as
completely
as
did
the
original
democrats
because
they
too
assume
and
in
a
much
more
complicated
civilization
that
somehow
mysteriously
there
exists
in
the
hearts
of
men
a
knowledge
of
the
world
beyond
their
reach
i
argue
that
representative
government
either
in
what
is
ordinarily
called
politics
or
in
industry
can
not
be
worked
successfully
no
matter
what
the
basis
of
election
unless
there
is
an
independent
expert
organization
for
making
the
unseen
facts
intelligible
to
those
who
have
to
make
the
decisions
i
attempt
therefore
to
argue
that
the
serious
acceptance
of
the
principle
that
personal
representation
must
be
supplemented
by
representation
of
the
unseen
facts
would
alone
permit
a
satisfactory
decentralization
and
allow
us
to
escape
from
the
intolerable
and
unworkable
fiction
that
each
of
us
must
acquire
a
competent
opinion
about
all
public
affairs
it
is
argued
that
the
problem
of
the
press
is
confused
because
the
critics
and
the
apologists
expect
the
press
to
realize
this
fiction
expect
it
to
make
up
for
all
that
was
not
foreseen
in
the
theory
of
democracy
and
that
the
readers
expect
this
miracle
to
be
performed
at
no
cost
or
trouble
to
themselves
the
newspapers
are
regarded
by
democrats
as
a
panacea
for
their
own
defects
whereas
analysis
of
the
nature
of
news
and
of
the
economic
basis
of
journalism
seems
to
show
that
the
newspapers
necessarily
and
inevitably
reflect
and
therefore
in
greater
or
lesser
measure
intensify
the
defective
organization
of
public
opinion
my
conclusion
is
that
public
opinions
must
be
organized
for
the
press
if
they
are
to
be
sound
not
by
the
press
as
is
the
case
today
this
organization
i
conceive
to
be
in
the
first
instance
the
task
of
a
political
science
that
has
won
its
proper
place
as
formulator
in
advance
of
real
decision
instead
of
apologist
critic
or
reporter
after
the
decision
has
been
made
i
try
to
indicate
that
the
perplexities
of
government
and
industry
are
conspiring
to
give
political
science
this
enormous
opportunity
to
enrich
itself
and
to
serve
the
public
and
of
course
i
hope
that
these
pages
will
help
a
few
people
to
realize
that
opportunity
more
vividly
and
therefore
to
pursue
it
more
consciously

the
picture
of
a
general
presiding
over
an
editorial
conference
at
the
most
terrible
hour
of
one
of
the
great
battles
of
history
seems
more
like
a
scene
from
the
chocolate
soldier
than
a
page
from
life
yet
we
know
at
first
hand
from
the
officer
who
edited
the
french
communiqués
that
these
conferences
were
a
regular
part
of
the
business
of
war
that
in
the
worst
moment
of
verdun
general
joffre
and
his
cabinet
met
and
argued
over
the
nouns
adjectives
and
verbs
that
were
to
be
printed
in
the
newspapers
the
next
morning
the
evening
communiqué
of
the
february
says
de
pierrefeu
footnote
q
pp
was
edited
in
a
dramatic
atmosphere
berthelot
of
the
prime
minister
office
had
just
telephoned
by
order
of
the
minister
asking
general
pellé
to
strengthen
the
report
and
to
emphasize
the
proportions
of
the
attack
it
was
necessary
to
prepare
the
public
for
the
worst
outcome
in
case
the
affair
turned
into
a
catastrophe
this
anxiety
showed
clearly
that
neither
at
nor
at
the
ministry
of
war
had
the
government
found
reason
for
confidence
as
berthelot
spoke
general
pellé
made
notes
he
handed
me
the
paper
on
which
he
had
written
the
government
wishes
together
with
the
order
of
the
day
issued
by
general
von
deimling
and
found
on
some
prisoners
in
which
it
was
stated
that
this
attack
was
the
supreme
offensive
to
secure
peace
skilfully
used
all
this
was
to
demonstrate
that
germany
was
letting
loose
a
gigantic
effort
an
effort
without
precedent
and
that
from
its
success
she
hoped
for
the
end
of
the
war
the
logic
of
this
was
that
nobody
need
be
surprised
at
our
withdrawal
when
a
half
hour
later
i
went
down
with
my
manuscript
i
found
gathered
together
in
colonel
claudel
office
he
being
away
the
general
janin
colonel
dupont
and
renouard
fearing
that
i
would
not
succeed
in
giving
the
desired
impression
general
pellé
had
himself
prepared
a
proposed
communiqué
i
read
what
i
had
just
done
it
was
found
to
be
too
moderate
general
pellé
on
the
other
hand
seemed
too
alarming
i
had
purposely
omitted
von
deimling
order
of
the
day
to
put
it
into
the
communiqué
be
to
break
with
the
formula
to
which
the
public
was
would
be
to
transform
it
into
a
kind
of
pleading
it
would
seem
to
say
do
you
suppose
we
can
resist
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
the
public
would
be
distracted
by
this
change
of
tone
and
would
believe
that
everything
was
lost
i
explained
my
reasons
and
suggested
giving
deimling
text
to
the
newspapers
in
the
form
of
a
separate
note
opinion
being
divided
general
pellé
went
to
ask
general
de
castelnau
to
come
and
decide
finally
the
general
arrived
smiling
quiet
and
good
humored
said
a
few
pleasant
words
about
this
new
kind
of
literary
council
of
war
and
looked
at
the
texts
he
chose
the
simpler
one
gave
more
weight
to
the
first
phrase
inserted
the
words
had
been
anticipated
which
supply
a
reassuring
quality
and
was
flatly
against
inserting
von
deimling
order
but
was
for
transmitting
it
to
the
press
in
a
special
note
general
joffre
that
evening
read
the
communiqué
carefully
and
approved
it
within
a
few
hours
those
two
or
three
hundred
words
would
be
read
all
over
the
world
they
would
paint
a
picture
in
men
minds
of
what
was
happening
on
the
slopes
of
verdun
and
in
front
of
that
picture
people
would
take
heart
or
despair
the
shopkeeper
in
brest
the
peasant
in
lorraine
the
deputy
in
the
palais
bourbon
the
editor
in
amsterdam
or
minneapolis
had
to
be
kept
in
hope
and
yet
prepared
to
accept
possible
defeat
without
yielding
to
panic
they
are
told
therefore
that
the
loss
of
ground
is
no
surprise
to
the
french
command
they
are
taught
to
regard
the
affair
as
serious
but
not
strange
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
french
general
staff
was
not
fully
prepared
for
the
german
offensive
supporting
trenches
had
not
been
dug
alternative
roads
had
not
been
built
barbed
wire
was
lacking
but
to
confess
that
would
have
aroused
images
in
the
heads
of
civilians
that
might
well
have
turned
a
reverse
into
a
disaster
the
high
command
could
be
disappointed
and
yet
pull
itself
together
the
people
at
home
and
abroad
full
of
uncertainties
and
with
none
of
the
professional
man
singleness
of
purpose
might
on
the
basis
of
a
complete
story
have
lost
sight
of
the
war
in
a
melee
of
faction
and
about
the
competence
of
the
officers
instead
therefore
of
letting
the
public
act
on
all
the
facts
which
the
generals
knew
the
authorities
presented
only
certain
facts
and
these
only
in
such
a
way
as
would
be
most
likely
to
steady
the
people
in
this
case
the
men
who
arranged
the
knew
what
the
real
one
was
but
a
few
days
later
an
incident
occurred
about
which
the
french
staff
did
not
know
the
truth
the
germans
announced
footnote
on
february
pierrefeu
pp
that
on
the
previous
afternoon
they
had
taken
fort
douaumont
by
assault
at
french
headquarters
in
chantilly
no
one
could
understand
this
news
for
on
the
morning
of
the
after
the
engagement
of
the
xxth
corps
the
battle
had
taken
a
turn
for
the
better
reports
from
the
front
said
nothing
about
douaumont
but
inquiry
showed
that
the
german
report
was
true
though
no
one
as
yet
knew
how
the
fort
had
been
taken
in
the
meantime
the
german
communiqué
was
being
flashed
around
the
world
and
the
french
had
to
say
something
so
headquarters
explained
in
the
midst
of
total
ignorance
at
chantilly
about
the
way
the
attack
had
taken
place
we
imagined
in
the
evening
communiqué
of
the
a
plan
of
the
attack
which
certainly
had
a
thousand
to
one
chance
of
being
true
the
communiqué
of
this
imaginary
battle
read
a
bitter
struggle
is
taking
place
around
fort
de
douaumont
which
is
an
advanced
post
of
the
old
defensive
organization
of
verdun
the
position
taken
this
morning
by
the
enemy
several
unsuccessful
assaults
that
cost
him
very
heavy
has
been
reached
again
and
passed
by
our
troops
whom
the
enemy
has
not
been
able
to
drive
back
footnote

my

the

a
furious

fruitless
assaults

extremely
heavy

footnote
the
french
text
says
pertes
tres

thus
the
english
translation
exaggerates
the
original
text
was
reached
again
and
gone
beyond
by
our
troops
which
all
the
attempts
of
the
enemy
have
not
been
able
to
push
back
what
had
actually
happened
differed
from
both
the
french
and
german
accounts
while
changing
troops
in
the
line
the
position
had
somehow
been
forgotten
in
a
confusion
of
orders
only
a
battery
commander
and
a
few
men
remained
in
the
fort
some
german
soldiers
seeing
the
door
open
had
crawled
into
the
fort
and
taken
everyone
inside
prisoner
a
little
later
the
french
who
were
on
the
slopes
of
the
hill
were
horrified
at
being
shot
at
from
the
fort
there
had
been
no
battle
at
douaumont
and
no
losses
nor
had
the
french
troops
advanced
beyond
it
as
the
communiqués
seemed
to
say
they
were
beyond
it
on
either
side
to
be
sure
but
the
fort
was
in
enemy
hands
yet
from
the
communiqué
everyone
believed
that
the
fort
was
half
surrounded
the
words
did
not
explicitly
say
so
but
the
press
as
usual
forced
the
pace
military
writers
concluded
that
the
germans
would
soon
have
to
surrender
in
a
few
days
they
began
to
ask
themselves
why
the
garrison
since
it
lacked
food
had
not
yet
surrendered
it
was
necessary
through
the
press
bureau
to
request
them
to
drop
the
encirclement
theme
footnote
pierrefeu
pp
the
editor
of
the
french
communiqué
tells
us
that
as
the
battle
dragged
out
his
colleagues
and
he
set
out
to
neutralize
the
pertinacity
of
the
germans
by
continual
insistence
on
their
terrible
losses
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
at
this
time
and
in
fact
until
late
in
the
orthodox
view
of
the
war
for
all
the
allied
peoples
was
that
it
would
be
decided
by
attrition
nobody
believed
in
a
war
of
movement
it
was
insisted
that
strategy
did
not
count
or
diplomacy
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
killing
germans
the
general
public
more
or
less
believed
the
dogma
but
it
had
constantly
to
be
reminded
of
it
in
face
of
spectacular
german
successes
almost
no
day
passed
but
the
communiqué
ascribed
to
the
germans
with
some
appearance
of
justice
heavy
losses
extremely
heavy
spoke
of
bloody
sacrifices
heaps
of
corpses
hecatombs
likewise
the
wireless
constantly
used
the
statistics
of
the
intelligence
bureau
at
verdun
whose
chief
major
cointet
had
invented
a
method
of
calculating
german
losses
which
obviously
produced
marvelous
results
every
fortnight
the
figures
increased
a
hundred
thousand
or
so
these
casualties
put
out
divided
into
daily
weekly
monthly
losses
repeated
in
all
sorts
of
ways
produced
a
striking
effect
our
formulae
varied
little
to
prisoners
the
german
losses
in
the
course
of
the
attack
have
been
considerable
is
proved
that
the
losses
enemy
exhausted
by
his
losses
has
not
renewed
the
attack
certain
formulae
later
abandoned

they
had
been
overworked
were
used
each

our

constant

itself

to
create
a
bloody
background
in

of
the
denials
from
nauen
the

tried
vainly
to
destroy
the

the
thesis
of
the
french
command
which

guidance
of
the
censors
this
offensive
engages
the
active
forces
of
our
opponent
whose
manpower
is
declining
we
have
learned
that
the

is

footnote
p
according
to
de
pierrefeu
the
french
command
had
converted
itself
to
this
belief
by
an
extraordinary
aberration
of
mind
only
the
attrition
of
the
enemy
was
seen
it
appeared
that
our
forces
were
not
subject
to
attrition
general
nivelle
shared
these
ideas
we
saw
the
result
in
we
have
learned
to
call
this
propaganda
a
group
of
men
who
can
prevent
independent
access
to
the
event
arrange
the
news
of
it
to
suit
their
purpose
that
the
purpose
was
in
this
case
patriotic
does
not
affect
the
argument
at
all
they
used
their
power
to
make
the
allied
publics
see
affairs
as
they
desired
them
to
be
seen
the
casualty
figures
of
major
cointet
which
were
spread
about
the
world
are
of
the
same
order
they
were
intended
to
provoke
a
particular
kind
of
inference
namely
that
the
war
of
attrition
was
going
in
favor
of
the
french
but
the
inference
is
not
drawn
in
the
form
of
argument
it
results
almost
automatically
from
the
creation
of
a
mental
picture
of
endless
germans
slaughtered
on
the
hills
about
verdun
by
putting
the
dead
germans
in
the
focus
of
the
picture
and
by
omitting
to
mention
the
french
dead
a
very
special
view
of
the
battle
was
built
up
it
was
a
view
designed
to
neutralize
the
effects
of
german
territorial
advances
and
the
impression
of
power
which
the
persistence
of
the
offensive
was
making
it
was
also
a
view
that
tended
to
make
the
public
acquiesce
in
the
demoralizing
defensive
strategy
imposed
upon
the
allied
armies
for
the
public
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
war
consists
of
great
strategic
movements
flank
attacks
encirclements
and
dramatic
surrenders
had
gradually
to
forget
that
picture
in
favor
of
the
terrible
idea
that
by
matching
lives
the
war
would
be
won
through
its
control
over
all
news
from
the
front
the
general
staff
substituted
a
view
of
the
facts
that
comported
with
this
strategy
the
general
staff
of
an
army
in
the
field
is
so
placed
that
within
wide
limits
it
can
control
what
the
public
will
perceive
it
controls
the
selection
of
correspondents
who
go
to
the
front
controls
their
movements
at
the
front

censors
their
messages
from
the
front

operates
the
wires
the
government
behind
the
army
by
its
command
of
cables
and
passports
mails
and
custom
houses
and
blockades
increases
the
control
it
emphasizes
it
by
legal
power
over
publishers
over
public
meetings
and
by
its
secret
service
but
in
the
case
of
an
army
the
control
is
far
from
perfect
there
is
always
the
enemy
communiqué
which
in
these
days
of
wireless
can
not
be
kept
away
from
neutrals
above
all
there
is
the
talk
of
the
soldiers
which
blows
back
from
the
front
and
is
spread
about
when
they
are
on
leave

american
attack
at
mihiel

in
the
everybody
in

told

else
the
deep
secret
an
army
is
an
unwieldy
thing
and
that
is
why
the
naval
and
diplomatic
censorship
is
almost
always
much
more
complete
fewer
people
know
what
is
going

their
acts
are
more
easily
supervised
without
some
form
of
censorship
propaganda
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
is
impossible
in
order
to
conduct
a
propaganda
there
must
be
some
barrier
between
the
public
and
the
event
access
to
the
real
environment
must
be
limited
before
anyone
can
create
a
that
he
thinks
wise
or
desirable
for
while
people
who
have
direct
access
can
misconceive
what
they
see
no
one
else
can
decide
how
they
shall
misconceive
it
unless
he
can
decide
where
they
shall
look
and
at
what
the
military
censorship
is
the
simplest
form
of
barrier
but
by
no
means
the
most
important
because
it
is
known
to
exist
and
is
therefore
in
certain
measure
agreed
to
and
discounted
at
different
times
and
for
different
subjects
some
men
impose
and
other
men
accept
a
particular
standard
of
secrecy
the
frontier
between
what
is
concealed
because
publication
is
not
as
we
say
compatible
with
the
public
interest
fades
gradually
into
what
is
concealed
because
it
is
believed
to
be
none
of
the
public
business
the
notion
of
what
constitutes
a
person
private
affairs
is
elastic
thus
the
amount

privacy
is
insisted
upon
at
all
kinds
of
places
in
the
area
of
what
is
called

it
is
often
very
illuminating
therefore
to
ask
yourself
how
you
got
at
the
facts
on
which
you
base
your
opinion
who
actually
saw

the
thing
about
which
you
have
an
opinion
was
it
the
man
who
told
you
or
the
man
who
told
him
or
someone
still
further
removed
and
how
much
was
he
permitted
to
see
when
he
informs
you
that
france
thinks
this
and
that
what
part
of
france
did
he
watch
how
was
he
able
to
watch
it
where
was
he
when
he
watched
it
what
frenchmen
was
he
permitted
to
talk
to
what
newspapers
did
he
read
and
where
did
they
learn
what
they
say
you
can
ask
yourself
these
questions
but
you
can
rarely
answer
them
they
will
remind
you
however
of
the
distance
which
often
separates
your
public
opinion
from
the
event
with
which
it
deals
and
the
reminder
is
itself
a
protection

can
be
had
by
considering

propaganda
during

remembering
that
the

had
run
over
two
years
and
a
half
before
america
entered
it
that
millions
upon
millions
of

had
been

had
been
delivered

so
it
may
well
happen
as
it
did
for
example
in
the
case
of
salem

that
a

will
reduce
a
whole

center

international
influences
converge
to
a
genteel
provincial
town
all
the
immediate
effects
of
more
rapid
transit
are
not
necessarily
good
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
for
example
that
the
railroad
system
of
france
so
highly
centralized
upon
paris
has
been
an
unmixed
blessing
to
the
french
people
it
is
certainly
true
that
problems
arising
out
of
the
means
of
communication
are
of
the
utmost
importance
and
one
of
the
most
constructive
features
of
the
program
of
the

has
been
the
study
given

the
wisdom

taking

in

the

also
there

limitations
none

real
because

the

and
at

is
wider
than
the

to
which
they
belong
among
women
the
social
set
and
the
circle
of
talk
are
frequently
almost
identical
it
is
in
the
social
set
that
ideas
derived
from
reading
and
lectures
and
from
the
circle
of
talk
converge
are
sorted
out
accepted
rejected

it

finally
decided
in
each
phase
of
a
discussion
which
authorities
and
which

information
are
admissible
and
which
not
our
social
set
consists
of
those
who
figure
as
people
in
the
phrase
people
are
saying
they
are
the
people
whose
approval
matters
most
intimately
to
us
in

among

of
wide
interests
and
with
the
means
for
moving
about
the
social

is
not
so
rigidly
defined
but
even
in
big
cities
there
are
quarters
and
nests
of
villages
containing
social
sets
in
smaller
communities
there
may
exist
a
freer
circulation
a
more
genuine
fellowship
from
after
breakfast
to
before
dinner
but
few
people
do
not
know
nevertheless
which
set
they
really
belong
to
and
which
not
usually
the
distinguishing
mark
of
a
social
set
is
the
presumption
that
the
children
may
intermarry
to
marry
outside
the
set
involves
at
the
very
least
a
moment
of
doubt
before
the
engagement
can
be
approved
each
social
set
has
a
fairly
clear
picture
of
its
relative
position
in
the
hierarchy
of
social
sets
between
sets
at
the
same
level
association
is
easy
individuals
are
quickly
accepted
hospitality
is
normal
and
unembarrassed
but
in
contact
between
sets
that
are
higher
or
lower
there
is
always
reciprocal
hesitation
a
faint
malaise
and
a
consciousness
of
difference
to
be
sure
in
a
society
like
that
of
the
united
states
individuals
move
somewhat
freely
out
of
one
set
into
another
especially
where
there
is
no
racial
barrier
and
where
economic
position
changes
so
rapidly
economic
position
however
is
not
measured
by
the
amount
of
income
for
in
the
first
generation
at
least
it
is
not
income
that
determines
social
standing
but
the
character
of
a
man
work
and
it
may
take
a
generation
or
two
before
this
fades
out
of
the
family
tradition
thus
banking
law
medicine
public
utilities
newspapers
the
church
large
retailing
brokerage
manufacture
are
rated
at
a
different
social
value
from
salesmanship
superintendence
expert
technical
work
nursing
school
teaching
shop
keeping
and
those
in
turn
are
rated
as
differently
from
plumbing
being
a
chauffeur
dressmaking
subcontracting
or
stenography
as
these
are
from
being
a
butler
lady
maid
a
moving
picture
operator
or
a
locomotive
engineer
and
yet
the
financial
return
does
not
necessarily
coincide
with
these
gradations
whatever
the
tests
of
admission
the
social
set
when
formed
is
not
a
mere
economic
class
but
something
which
more
nearly
resembles
a
biological
clan

love
marriage
and

to

more

with

opinions
encounter
the

respectability
propriety

complacently
within

a
persistent
sense

its
place

at
any

there
is
something
which
might
almost
be

but
vertically
the
actual
binding
together
of
society
in
so
far
as
it

accomplished
by

for

social
set
but
its
importance
comes
from
the
fact
that
here
at
last
the
distinction
between
public
and
private
affairs
practically
disappears
the
private
affairs
of
this
set
are
public
matters
and
public
matters
are
its
private
often
its
family
affairs
the
confinements
of
margot
asquith
like
the
confinements
of
royalty
are
as
the
philosophers
say
in
much
the
same
universe
of
discourse
as
a
tariff
bill
or
a
parliamentary
debate
there
are
large
areas
of
governments
in
which
this
social
set
is
not
interested
and
in
america
at
least
it
has
exercised
only
a
fluctuating
control
over
the
national
government
but
its
power
in
foreign
affairs
is
always
very
great
and
in
war
time
its
prestige
is
enormously
enhanced
that
is
natural
enough
because
these
cosmopolitans
have
a
contact
with
the
outer
world
that
most
people
do
not
possess
they
have
dined
with
each
other
in
the
capitals
and
their
sense
of
national
honor
is
no
mere
abstraction
it
is
a
concrete
experience
of
being
snubbed
or
approved
by
their
friends
to
kennicott
of
gopher
prairie
it
matters
mighty
little
what
winston
thinks
and
a
great
deal
what
ezra
stowbody
thinks
but
to
mingott
with
a
daughter
married
to
the
earl
of
swithin
it
matters
a
lot
when
she
visits
her
daughter
or
entertains
winston
himself
kennicott
and
mingott
are
both
socially
sensitive
but
mingott
is
sensitive
to
a
social
set
that
governs
the
world
while
kennicott
social
set
governs
only
in
gopher
prairie
but
in
matters
that
effect
the
larger
relationships
of
the
great
society
kennicott
will
often
be
found
holding
what
he
thinks
is
purely
his
own
opinion
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
has
trickled
down
to
gopher
prairie
from
high
society
transmuted
on
its
passage
through
the
provincial
social
sets
it
is
no
part
of
our
inquiry
to
attempt
an
account
of
the
social
tissue
we
need
only
fix
in
mind
how
big
is
the
part
played
by
the
social
set
in
our
spiritual
contact
with
the
world
how
it
tends
to
fix
what
is
admissible
and
to
determine
how
it
shall
be
judged
affairs
within
its
immediate
competence
each
set
more
or
less
determines
for
itself
above
all
it
determines
the
detailed
administration
of
the
judgment
but
the
judgment
itself
is
formed
on
patterns

that
may
be
inherited
from
the
past
transmitted
or
imitated
from
other
social
sets
the
highest
social
set
consists
of
those
who
embody
the
leadership
of
the
great
society
as
against
almost
every
other
social
set
where
the
bulk
of
the
opinions
are
first
hand
only
about
local
affairs
in
this
highest
society
the
big
decisions
of
war
and
peace
of
social
strategy
and
the
ultimate
distribution
of
political
power
are
intimate
experiences
within
a
circle
of
what
potentially
at
least
are
personal
acquaintances
since
position
and
contact
play
so
big
a
part
in
determining
what
can
be
seen
heard
read
and
experienced
as
well
as
what
it
is
permissible
to
see
hear
read
and
know
it
is
no
wonder
that
moral
judgment
is
so
much
more
common
than
constructive
thought
yet
in
truly
effective
thinking
the
prime
necessity
is
to
liquidate
judgments

disentangle

curious
and
man
history

what
it
is
political
opinion
on
the
scale
of
the
great
society
requires
an
amount
of
selfless
equanimity
rarely
attainable
by
any
one
for
any
length
of
time
we
are
concerned
in
public
affairs
but
immersed
in
our
private
ones
the
time
and
attention
are
limited
that
we
can
spare
for
the
labor
of
not
taking
opinions
for

we
are

time

naturally
it
is
possible
to
make
a
rough
estimate
only
of
the
amount
of
attention
people
give
each
day
to
informing
themselves
about
public
affairs
yet
it
is
interesting
that
three
estimates
that

examined
agree
tolerably
well

they
were
made
at

in

received
replies
from

between
seventy
and
percent
of
all
those
who
replied
to
either
inquiry
thought
they
spent
a
quarter
of

a

reading

only
four
percent
of
the
chicago
group
guessed
at
less
than
this
and
percent
guessed
at
more
among
the
new

a
little
over
eight
percent
figured
their
newspaper
reading
at
less
than
fifteen
minutes
and
seventeen
and
a
half
at
more
very
few
people
have
an
accurate
idea
of
fifteen
minutes
so
the
figures
are
not
to
be
taken
literally
moreover
business
men
professional
people
and
college
students
are
most
of
them
liable
to
a
curious
little
bias
against
appearing
to
spend
too
much
time
over
the
newspapers
and
perhaps
also
to
a
faint
suspicion
of
a
desire
to
be
known
as
rapid
readers
all
that
the
figures
can
justly
be
taken
to
mean
is
that
over
three
quarters
of
those
in
the
selected
groups
rate
rather
low
the
attention
they
give
to
printed
news
of
the
outer
world
these
time
estimates
are
fairly
well
confirmed
by
a
test
which
is
less
subjective
scott
asked
his
chicagoans
how
many
papers
they
read
each

are
percent
which
comes
fairly
close
to
the
percent
in
scott
group
who
rate
themselves
at
fifteen
minutes
a
day
the
omnivorous
readers
of
from
four
to
eight
papers
coincide
roughly
with
the
percent
who
rated
themselves
at
more
than
fifteen
minutes
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
guess
how
the

is
distributed

these

correspond
a

too
closely
with

ideals
of
what
is
cultured
and
moral
manly
and
decisive
not

they

business

they
were
asked
not
what

why
they

nearly
percent
based
their
conscious
preference
on
local

or
political
or
financial
or
foreign
or

or

the

thirty

decided
on

not

they
ranged
from
not
quite
seven
who
decided
for
ethical

down
to
one
twentieth
of
one

about

how
do
these
preferences
correspond
with
the
space
given
by

to
various
subjects
unfortunately
there
are
no
data
collected
on
this
point
for
the
newspapers
read
by
the
chicago
and
new

groups
at
the
time
the

were
made
but
there
is
an
interesting
analysis
made
over
twenty

by
wilcox
he
studied
one

ten

and
classified
the

it

exclude

and
recompute
the
percentages
for
the
advertisements
occupied
only
an
infinitesimal
part
of
the
conscious
preference
of
the
chicago
group
or
the
college
group
i
think
this
is
justifiable
for
our
purposes
because
the
press
prints
what
advertisements
it
can
get
footnote
except
those
which
it
regards
as
objectionable
and
those
which
in
rare
instances
are
crowded
out
whereas
the
rest
of
the
paper
is
designed
to
the
taste
of
its

that
is
to
say

miscellaneous

you
find
a

of
of
the
edited

devoted
in
to
the
of
reasons
given
by
chicago
business
men
in
for
preferring
a
particular
newspaper
and
to
the
five
features
which
most
interested
of
the
new
york
college
students
in
this
would
seem
to
show
that
the
tastes
of
business
men
and
college
students
in
big
cities
still
correspond
more
or
less
to
the
averaged
judgments
of
newspaper
editors
in
big
cities
twenty
years
ago
since
that
time
the
proportion
of
features
to
news
has
undoubtedly
increased
and
so
has
the
circulation
and
the
size
of
newspapers
therefore
if
you
could
secure
accurate
replies
from
more
typical
groups
than
college
students
or
business
and
professional
men
you
would
expect
to
find
a
smaller
percentage
of
time
devoted
to
public
affairs
as
well
as
a
smaller
percentage
of
space
on
the
other
hand
you
would
expect
to
find
that
the
average
man
spends
more
than
the
quarter
of
an
hour
on
his
newspaper
and
that
while
the
percentage
of
space
given
to
public
affairs
is
less
than
twenty
years
ago
the
net
amount
is
greater
no
elaborate
deductions
are
to
be
drawn
from
these
figures
they
help
merely
to
make
somewhat
more
concrete
our
notions
of
the
effort
that
goes
day
by
day
into
acquiring
the
data
of
our
opinions
the
newspapers
are
of
course
not
the
only
means

they
are
certainly

exchange
in
words
in
quarters
well
acquainted
with
french
ways
and
character
i
find
a
tendency
to
think
that
undue
sensibility
has
been
shown
by
our
press
and
public
opinion
in
the
lively
and
at
times
intemperate
language
of
the
french
press
through
the
present
crisis
the
point
was
put
to
me
by
a
neutral
observer
in
the
following
manner
words
like
money
are
tokens
of
value
they
represent
meaning
therefore
and
just
as
money
their
representative
value
goes
up
and
down
the
french
word
was
used
by
bossuet
with
a
terrible
weight
of
meaning
which
it
has
lost
a
similar
thing
can
be
observed
with
the
english
word
some
nations
constitutionally
tend
to
understate
others
to
overstate
what
the
british
tommy
called
an
unhealthy
place
could
only
be
described
by
an
italian
soldier
by
means
of
a
rich
vocabulary
aided
with
an
exuberant
mimicry
nations
that
understate
keep
their
sound
nations
that
overstate
suffer
from
inflation
in
their
language
expressions
such
as
distinguished
scholar
clever
writer
must
be
translated
into
french
as
great
savant
exquisite
master
it
is
a
mere
matter
of
exchange
just
as
in
france
one
pound
pays
francs
and
yet
one
knows
that
that
does
not
increase
its
value
at
home
englishmen
reading
the
french
press
should
endeavour
to
work
out
a
mental
operation
similar
to
that
of
the
banker
who
puts
back
francs
into
pounds
and
not
forget
in
so
doing
that
while
in
normal
times
the
change
was
it
is
now
on
account
of
the
war
for
there
is
a
war
fluctuation
on
word
exchanges
as
well
as
on
money
exchanges
the
argument
one
hopes
works
both
ways
and
frenchmen
do
not
fail
to
realize
that
there
is
as
much
value
behind
english
reticence
as
behind
their
own
exuberance
of
expression
millions
of
those
who
are
watching
him
can
read
hardly
at
all
millions
more
can
read
the
words
but
can
not
understand
them
of
those
who
can
both
read
and
understand
a
good
we
may
assume
have
some
part
of
half
an
hour
a
day
to
spare
for
the
subject
to
them
the
words
so
acquired
are
the
cue
for
a
whole
train
of
ideas
on
which
ultimately
a
vote
of
untold
consequences
may
be
based
necessarily
the
ideas
which
we
allow
the
words
we
read
to
evoke
form
the
biggest
part
of
the
original
data
of
our
opinions
the
world
is
vast
the
situations
that
concern
us
are
intricate
the
messages
are
few
the
biggest
part
of
opinion
must
be
constructed
in
the
imagination
when
we
use
the
word
mexico
what
picture
does
it
evoke
in
a
resident
of
new
york
likely
as
not
it
is
some
composite
of
sand
cactus
oil
wells
greasers
indians
testy
old
cavaliers
flourishing
whiskers
and
sovereignty
or
perhaps
an
idyllic
peasantry
à
la
jean
jacques
assailed
by
the
prospect
of
smoky
industrialism
and
fighting
for
the
rights
of
man
what
does
the
word
japan
evoke
is
it
a
vague
horde
of
yellow
men
surrounded
by
yellow
perils
picture
brides
fans
samurai
banzais
art
and
cherry
blossoms
or
the
word
alien
according
to
a
group
of
new
england
college
students
writing
in
the
year
an
alien
was
the
following
footnote
new
december
a
person
hostile
to
this
country
a
person
against
the
government
a
person
who
is
on
the
opposite
side
a
native
of
an
unfriendly
country
a
foreigner
at
war
a
foreigner
who
tries
to
do
harm
to
the
country
he
is
in
an
enemy
from
a
foreign
land
a
person
against
a
country
etc
yet
the
word
alien
is
an
unusually
exact
legal
term
far
more
exact
than
words
like
sovereignty
independence
national
honor
rights
defense
aggression
imperialism
capitalism
socialism
about
which
we
so
readily
take
sides
for
or
against
the
power
to
dissociate
superficial
analogies
attend
to
differences
and
appreciate
variety
is
lucidity
of
mind
it
is
a
relative
faculty
yet
the
differences
in
lucidity
are
extensive
say
as
between
a
newly
born
infant
and
a
botanist
examining
a
flower
to
the
infant
there
is
precious
little
difference
between
his
own
toes
his
father

the
lamp
on
the
table
the
moon
in
the
sky
and
a
nice
bright
yellow
edition
of
guy
de
maupassant
to
many
a
member
of
the
union
league
club
there
is
no
remarkable
difference
between
a
democrat
a
socialist
an
anarchist
and
a
burglar
while
to
a
highly
sophisticated
anarchist
there
is
a
whole
universe
of
difference
between
bakunin
tolstoi
and
kropotkin
these
examples
show
how
difficult
it
might
be
to
secure
a
sound
public
opinion
about
de
maupassant
among
babies
or
about
democrats
in
the
union
league
club
a
man
who
merely
rides
in
other
people
automobiles
may
not
rise
to
finer
discrimination
than
between
a
ford
a
taxicab
and
an
automobile
but
let
that
same
man
own
a
car
and
drive
it
let
him
as
the
psychoanalysts
would
say
project
his
libido
upon
automobiles
and
he
will
describe
a
difference
in
carburetors
by
looking
at
the
rear
end
of
a
car
a
city
block
away
that
is
why
it
is
often
such
a
relief
when
the
talk
turns
from
general
topics
to
a
man
own
hobby
it
is
like
turning
from
the
landscape
in
the
parlor
to
the
ploughed
field
outdoors
it
is
a
return
to
the
three
dimensional
world
after

of
his

it
is
announced
with

so
long
as

a
broad
appeal
takes
account
of

a

human

are
like

there

there
are
deeper
strata
which

thus
the

indistinguishable
from
any

no
wonder
that
the
magazines
with
the
large
circulations
prefer
the
face
of
a
pretty
girl
to
any
other
trade
mark
a
face
pretty
enough
to
be
alluring
but
innocent
enough
to
be
acceptable
for
the
psychic
level
on
which
the
stimulus
acts
determines
whether
the
public
is
to
be
potentially
a
large
or
a
small
one
thus
the
environment
with
which
our
public
opinions
deal
is
refracted
in
many
ways
by
censorship
and
privacy
at
the
source
by
physical
and
social
barriers
at
the
other
end
by
scanty
attention
by
the
poverty
of
language
by
distraction
by
unconscious
constellations
of
feeling
by
wear

tear
violence
monotony
these
limitations
upon
our
access
to
that
environment
combine
with
the
obscurity
and
complexity
of
the
facts
themselves
to
thwart
clearness
and
justice
of

to
substitute

some

we
watch

just
as

a

is
a
connection
between

vision
and

facts
but
it
is
often
a
strange
connection
a
man
has
rarely
looked
at
a
landscape
let
us
say
except
to
examine
its
possibilities
for
division
into
building
lots
but
he
has
seen
a
number
of
landscapes
hanging
in
the
parlor
and
from
them
he
has
learned
to
think
of
a
landscape
as
a
rosy
sunset
or
as
a
country
road
with
a
church
steeple
and
a
silver
moon
one
day
he
goes
to
the
country
and
for
hours
he
does
not
see
a
single
landscape
then
the
sun
goes
down
looking
rosy
at
once
he
recognizes
a
landscape
and
exclaims
that
it
is
beautiful
but
two
days
later
when
he
tries
to
recall
what
he
saw
the
odds
are
that
he
will
remember
chiefly
some
landscape
in
a
parlor
unless
he
has
been
drunk
or
dreaming
or
insane
he
did
see
a
sunset
but
he
saw
in
it
and
above
all
remembers
from
it
more
of
what
the
oil
painting
taught
him
to
observe
than
what
an
impressionist
painter
for
example
or
a
cultivated
japanese
would
have
seen
and
taken
away
with
him
and
the
japanese
and
the
painter
in
turn
will
have
seen
and
remembered
more
of
the
form
they
had
learned
unless
they
happen
to
be
the
very
rare
people
who
find
fresh
sight
for
mankind
in
untrained
observation
we
pick
recognizable
signs
out
of
the
environment
the
signs
stand
for
ideas
and
these
ideas
we
fill
out
with
our
stock
of
images
we
do
not
so
much
see
this
man
and
that
sunset
rather
we
notice
that
the
thing
is
man
or
sunset
and
then
see
chiefly
what
our
mind
is
already
full
of
on
those
subjects
there
is
economy
in
this
for
the
attempt
to
see
all
things
freshly

in

rather
than
as

a
circle
of
friends
and
in
relation
to
close
associates
or
competitors
there
is
no
shortcut
through
and
no
substitute
for
an
individualized
understanding
those
whom
we
love
and
admire
most
are
the
men
and
women
whose
consciousness
is
peopled
thickly
with
persons
rather
than
with
types
who
know
us
rather
than
the
classification
into
which
we
might
fit
for
even
without
phrasing
it
to
ourselves
we
feel
intuitively
that
all
classification
is
in
relation
to
some
purpose
not
necessarily
our
own
that
between
two
human
beings
no
association
has
final
dignity
in
which
each
does
not
take
the
other
as
an
end
in
himself
there
is
a
taint
on
any
contact
between
two
people
which
does
not
affirm
as
an
axiom
the
personal
inviolability
of
both
but
modern
life
is
hurried
and
multifarious
above
all
physical
distance
separates
men
who
are
often
in
vital
contact
with
each
other
such
as
employer
and
employee
official
and
voter
there
is
neither
time
nor
opportunity
for
intimate
acquaintance
instead
we
notice
a
trait
which
marks
a
well
known
type
and
fill
in
the
rest
of
the
picture
by
means
of
the
stereotypes
we
carry
about
in
our
heads
he
is
an
agitator
that
much
we
notice
or
are
told
well
an
agitator
is
this
sort
of
person
and
so
is
this
sort
of
person
he
is
an
intellectual
he
is
a
plutocrat
he
is
a
foreigner
he
is
a
south
european
he
is
from
back
bay
he
is
a
harvard
man
how
different
from
the
statement
he
is
a
yale
man
he
is
a
regular
fellow
he
is
a
west
pointer
he
is
an
old
army
sergeant
he
is
a
greenwich
villager
what
do
we
know
about
him
then
and
about
her
he
is
an
international
banker
he
is
from
main
street
the
subtlest
and
most
pervasive
of
all
influences
ere
those
which
create
and
maintain
the
repertory
of
stereotypes
we
are
told
about
the
world
before
we
see
it
we
imagine
most
things
before
we
experience
them
and
those
preconceptions
unless
education
has
made
us
acutely
aware
govern
deeply
the
whole
process
of
perception
they
mark
out
certain
objects
as
familiar
or
strange
emphasizing
the
difference
so
that
the
slightly
familiar
is
seen
as
very
familiar
and
the
somewhat
strange
as
sharply
alien
they
are
aroused
by
small
signs
which
may
vary
from
a
true
index
to
a
vague
analogy
aroused
they
flood
fresh
vision
with
older
images
and
project
into
the
world
what
has
been
resurrected
in
memory
were
there
no
practical
uniformities
in
the
environment
there
would
be
no
economy
and
only
error
in
the
human
habit
of
accepting
foresight
for
sight
but
there
are
uniformities
sufficiently
accurate
and
the
need
of
economizing
attention
is
so
inevitable
that
the
abandonment
of
all
stereotypes
for
a
wholly
innocent
approach
to
experience
would
impoverish
human
life
what
matters
is
the
character
of
the
stereotypes
and
the
gullibility
with
which
we
employ
them
and
these
in
the
end
depend
upon
those
inclusive
patterns
which
constitute
our
philosophy
of
life
if
in
that
philosophy
we
assume
that
the
world
is
codified
according
to
a
code
which
we
possess
we
are
likely
to
make
our
reports
of
what
is
going
on
describe
a
world
run
by
our
code
but
if
our
philosophy
tells
us
that
each
man
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
world
that
his
intelligence
catches
at
best
only
phases
and
aspects
in
a
coarse
net
of
ideas
then
when
we
use
our
stereotypes
we
tend
to
know
that
they
are
only
stereotypes
to
hold
them
lightly
to
modify
them
gladly
we
tend
also
to
realize
more
and
more
clearly
when
our
ideas
started
where
they
started
how
they
came
to
us
why
we
accepted
them
all
useful
history
is
antiseptic
in
this
fashion
it
enables
us
to
know
what
fairy
tale
what
school
book
what
tradition
what
novel
play
picture
phrase
planted
one
preconception
in
this
mind
another
in
that
mind
those
who
wish
to
censor
art
do
not
at
least
underestimate
this
influence
they
generally
misunderstand
it
and
almost
always
they
are
absurdly
bent
on
preventing
other
people
from
discovering
anything
not
sanctioned
by
them
but
at
any
rate
like
plato
in
his
argument
about
the
poets
they
feel
vaguely
that
the
types
acquired
through
fiction
tend
to
be
imposed
on
reality
thus
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
moving
picture
is
steadily
building
up
imagery
which
is
then
evoked
by
the
words
people
read
in
their
newspapers
in
the
whole
experience
of
the
race
there
has
been
no
aid
to
visualization
comparable
to
the
cinema
if
a
florentine
wished
to
visualize
the
saints
he
could
go
to
the
frescoes
in
his
church
where
he
might
see
a
vision
of
saints
standardized
for
his
time
by
giotto
if
an
athenian
wished
to
visualize
the
gods
he
went
to
the
temples
but
the
number
of
objects
which
were
pictured
was
not
great
and
in
the
east
where
the
spirit
of
the
second
commandment
was
widely
accepted
the
portraiture
of
concrete
things
was
even
more
meager
and
for
that
reason
perhaps
the
faculty
of
practical
decision
was
by
so
much
reduced
in
the
western
world
however
during
the
last
few
centuries
there
has
been
an
enormous
increase
in
the
volume
and
scope
of
secular
description
the
word
picture
the
narrative
the
illustrated
narrative
and
finally
the
moving
picture
and
perhaps
the
talking
picture
photographs
have
the
kind
of
authority
over
imagination
which
the
printed
word
had
yesterday
and
the
spoken
word
before
that
they
seem
utterly
real
they
come
we
imagine
directly
to
us
without
human
meddling
and
they
are
the
most
effortless
food
for
the
mind
conceivable
any
description
in
words
or
even
any
inert
picture
requires
an
effort
of
memory
before
a
picture
exists
in
the
mind
but
on
the
screen
the
whole
process
of
observing
describing
reporting
and
then
imagining
has
been
accomplished
for
you
without
more
trouble
than
is
needed
to
stay
awake
the
result
which
your
imagination
is
always
aiming
at
is
reeled
off
on
the
screen
the
shadowy
idea
becomes
vivid
your
hazy
notion
let
us
say
of
the
ku
klux
klan
thanks
to
griffiths
takes
vivid
shape
when
you
see
the
birth
of
a
nation
historically
it
may
be
the
wrong
shape
morally
it
may
be
a
pernicious
shape
but
it
is
a
shape
and
i
doubt
whether
anyone
who
has
seen
the
film
and
does
not
know
more
about
the
ku
klux
klan
than
griffiths
will
ever
hear
the
name
again
without
seeing
those
white
horsemen
and
so
when
we
speak
of
the
mind
of
a
group
of
people
of
the
french
mind
the
militarist
mind
the
bolshevik
mind
we
are
liable
to
serious
confusion
unless
we
agree
to
separate
the
instinctive
equipment
from
the
stereotypes
the
patterns
and
the
formulae
which
play
so
decisive
a
part
in
building
up
the
mental
world
to
which
the
native
character
is
adapted
and
responds
failure
to
make
this
distinction
accounts
for
oceans
of
loose
talk
about
collective
minds
national
souls
and
race
psychology
to
be
sure
a
stereotype
may
be
so
consistently
and
authoritatively
transmitted
in
each
generation
from
parent
to
child
that
it
seems
almost
like
a
biological
fact
in
some
respects
we
may
indeed
have
become
as
wallas
says
footnote
graham
wallas
social
p
biologically
parasitic
upon
our
social
heritage
but
certainly
there
is
not
the
least
scientific
evidence
which
would
enable
anyone
to
argue
that
men
are
born
with
the
political
habits
of
the
country
in
which
they
are
born
in
so
far
as
political
habits
are
alike
in
a
nation
the
first
places
to
look
for
an
explanation
are
the
nursery
the
school
the
church
not
in
that
limbo
inhabited
by
group
minds
and
national
souls
until
you
have
thoroughly
failed
to
see
tradition
being
handed
on
from
parents
teachers
priests
and
uncles
it
is
a
solecism
of
the
worst
order
to
ascribe
political
differences
to
the
germ
plasm
it
is
possible
to
generalize
tentatively
and
with
a
decent
humility
about
comparative
differences
within
the
same
category
of
education
and
experience
yet
even
this
is
a
tricky
enterprise
for
almost
no
two
experiences
are
exactly
alike
not
even
of
two
children
in
the
same
household
the
older
son
never
does
have
the
experience
of
being
the
younger
and
therefore
until
we
are
able
to
discount
the
difference
in
nurture
we
must
withhold
judgment
about
differences
of
nature
as
well
judge
the
productivity
of
two
soils
by
comparing
their
yield
before
you
know
which
is
in
labrador
and
which
in
iowa
whether
they
have
been
cultivated
and
enriched

or
allowed

chapter
vii
stereotypes
as
defense
there
is
another
reason
besides
economy
of
effort
why
we
so
often
hold
to
our
stereotypes
when
we
might
pursue
a
more
disinterested
vision
the
systems
of
stereotypes
may
be
the
core
of
our
personal
tradition
the
defenses
of
our
position
in
society
they
are
an
ordered
more
or
less
consistent
picture
of
the
world
to
which
our
habits
our
tastes
our
capacities
our
comforts
and
our
hopes
have
adjusted
themselves
they
may
not
be
a
complete
picture
of
the
world
but
they
are
a
picture
of
a
possible
world
to
which
we
are
adapted
in
that
world
people
and
things
have
their
places
and
do
certain
expected
things
we
feel
at
home
there
we
fit
in
we
are
members
we
know
the
way
around
there
we
find
the
charm
of
the
familiar
the
normal
the
dependable
its
grooves
and
shapes
are
where
we
are
accustomed
to
find
them
and
though
we
have
abandoned
much
that
might
have
tempted
us
before
we
creased
ourselves
into
that
mould
once
we
are
firmly
in
it
fits
as
snugly
as
an
old
shoe
no
wonder
then
that
any
disturbance
of
the
stereotypes
seems
like
an
attack
upon
the
foundations
of
the
universe
it
is
an
attack
upon
the
foundations
of
universe
and
where
big
things
are
at
stake
we
do
not
readily
admit
that
there
is
any
distinction
between
our
universe
and
the
universe
a
world
which
turns
out
to
be
one
in
which
those
we
honor
are
unworthy
and
those
we
despise
are
noble
is
there
is
anarchy
if
our
order
of
precedence
is
not
the
only
possible
one
for
if
the
meek
should
indeed
inherit
the
earth
if
the
first
should
be
last
if
those
who
are
without
sin
alone
may
cast
a
stone
if
to
caesar
you
render
only
the
things
that
are
caesar
then
the
foundations
of
would
be
shaken
for
those
who
have
arranged
their
lives
as
if
these
maxims
were
not
true
a
pattern
of
stereotypes
is
not
neutral
it
is
not
merely
a
way
of
substituting
order
for
the
great
blooming
buzzing
confusion
of
reality
it
is
not
merely
a
short
cut
it
is
all
these
things
and
something
more
it
is
the
guarantee
of
our
it
is
the
projection
upon
the
world
of
our
own
sense
of
our
own
value
our
own
position
and
our
own
rights
the
stereotypes
are
therefore
highly
charged
with
the
feelings
that
are
attached
to
them
they
are
the
fortress
of
our
tradition
and
behind
its
defenses
we
can
continue
to
feel
ourselves
safe
in
the
position
we
occupy
when
for
example
in
the
fourth
century
aristotle
wrote
his
defense
of
slavery
in
the
face
of
increasing
skepticism
footnote
zimmern
see
his
footnote
p
the
athenian
slaves
were
in
great
part
indistinguishable
from
free
citizens
zimmern
quotes
an
amusing
passage
from
the
old
oligarch
explaining
the
good
treatment
of
the
slaves
suppose
it
were
legal
for
a
slave
to
be
beaten
by
a
citizen
it
would
frequently
happen
that
an
athenian
might
be
mistaken
for
a
slave
or
an
alien
and
receive
a
beating
since
the
athenian
people
is
not
better
clothed
than
the
slave
or
alien
nor
in
personal
appearance
is
there
any
superiority
this
absence
of
distinction
would
naturally
tend
to
dissolve
the
institution
if
free
men
and
slaves
looked
alike
what
basis
was
there
for
treating
them
so
differently
it
was
this
confusion
which
aristotle
set
himself
to
clear
away
in
the
first
book
of
his
politics
with
unerring
instinct
he
understood
that
to
justify
slavery
he
must
teach
the
greeks
a
way
of
their
slaves
that
comported
with
the
continuance
of
slavery
so
said
aristotle
there
are
beings
who
are
slaves
by
nature
footnote
bk
ch
he
then
is
by
nature
formed
a
slave
who
is
fitted
to
become
the
chattel
of
another
person
on
that
account
is
all
this
really
says
is
that
whoever
happens
to
be
a
slave
is
by
nature
intended
to
be
one
logically
the
statement
is
worthless
but
in
fact
it
is
not
a
proposition
at
all
and
logic
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
is
a
stereotype
or
rather
it
is
part
of
a
stereotype
the
rest
follows
almost
immediately
after
asserting
that
slaves
perceive
reason
but
are
not
endowed
with
the
use
of
it
aristotle
insists
that
it
is
the
intention
of
nature
to
make
the
bodies
of
slaves
and
free
men
different
from
each
other
that
the
one
should
be
robust
for
their
necessary
purposes
but
the
other
erect
useless
indeed
for
such
servile
labours
but
fit
for
civil
life
it
is
clear
then
that
some
men
are
free
by
nature
and
others
are
slaves
if
we
ask
ourselves
what
is
the
matter
with
aristotle
argument
we
find
that
he
has
begun
by
erecting
a
great
barrier
between
himself
and
the
facts
when
he
had
said
that
those
who
are
slaves
are
by
nature
intended
to
be
slaves
he
at
one
stroke
excluded
the
fatal
question
whether
those
particular
men
who
happened
to
be
slaves
were
the
particular
men
intended
by
nature
to
be
slaves
for
that
question
would
have
tainted
each
case
of
slavery
with
doubt
and
since
the
fact
of
being
a
slave
was
not
evidence
that
a
man
was
destined
to
be
one
no
certain
test
would
have
remained
aristotle
therefore
excluded
entirely
that
destructive
doubt
those
who
are
slaves
are
intended
to
be
slaves
each
slave
holder
was
to
look
upon
his
chattels
as
natural
slaves
when
his
eye
had
been
trained
to
see
them
that
way
he
was
to
note
as
confirmation
of
their
servile
character
the
fact
that
they
performed
servile
work
that
they
were
competent
to
do
servile
work
and
that
they
had
the
muscles
to
do
servile
work
this
is
the
perfect
stereotype
its
hallmark
is
that
it
precedes
the
use
of
reason
is
a
form
of
perception
imposes
a
certain
character
on
the
data
of
our
senses
before
the
data
reach
the
intelligence
the
stereotype
is
like
the
lavender
on
beacon
street
like
the
at
a
costume
ball
who
judges
whether
the
guest
has
an
appropriate
masquerade
there
is
nothing
so
obdurate
to
education
or
to
criticism
as
the
stereotype
it
stamps
itself
upon
the
evidence
in
the
very
act
of
securing
the
evidence
that
is
why
the
accounts
of
returning
travellers
are
often
an
interesting
tale
of
what
the
traveller
carried
abroad
with
him
on
his
trip
if
he
carried
chiefly
his
appetite
a
zeal
for
tiled
bathrooms
a
conviction
that
the
pullman
car
is
the
acme
of
human
comfort
and
a
belief
that
it
is
proper
to
tip
waiters
taxicab
drivers
and
barbers
but
under
no
circumstances
station
agents
and
ushers
then
his
odyssey
will
be
replete
with
good
meals
and
bad
meals
bathing
adventures
escapades
and
voracious
demands
for
money
or
if
he
is
a
more
serious
soul
he
may
while
on
tour
have
found
himself
at
celebrated
spots
having
touched
base
and
cast
one
furtive
glance
at
the
monument
he
buried
his
head
in
baedeker
read
every
word
through
and
moved
on
to
the
next
celebrated
spot
and
thus
returned
with
a
compact
and
orderly
impression
of
europe
rated
one
star
or
two
in
some
measure
stimuli
from
the
outside
especially
when
they
are
printed
or
spoken
words
evoke
some
part
of
a
system
of
stereotypes
so
that
the
actual
sensation
and
the
preconception
occupy
consciousness
at
the
same
time
the
two
are
blended
much
as
if
we
looked
at
red

he
may
be
shaken
to
such
an

as
to
distrust
all

to
expect
that
normally

will
not
be
what
it
is
generally
supposed
to
be
in

if

inverting

role
played
by

when

circulate
they
spread
from
place
to

they
were
reproduced
by
the

and
they
soon
permeated
the
whole
of
germany
it
was
said
that
the
belgian
people
by
the
clergy
had
intervened
perfidiously
in
the
hostilities
had
attacked
by
surprise
isolated
detachments
had
indicated
to
the

the
positions
occupied
by
the
troops
that
old
men
and
even

had
been
guilty
of
horrible
atrocities
upon
wounded
and
defenseless
german
soldiers
tearing
out
their
eyes
and
cutting
off
fingers
nose
or

the
priests
from
their
pulpits
had
exhorted
the
people
to
commit
these
crimes
promising
them
as
a
reward
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
had
even
taken
the
lead
in
this
public
credulity
accepted
these

the

powers
in

welcomed
them
without
hesitation
and
endorsed
them
with

public
opinion
in

was
disturbed
and
a
lively
indignation
manifested
itself
especially
against
the
who
were
held
responsible
for
the
barbarities
attributed
to
the

by

they

there
may
have
been
some
sniping
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
every
angry
belgian
had
rushed
to
the
library
opened
a
manual
of
international
law
and
had
informed
himself
whether
he
had
a
right
to
take
potshot
at
the
infernal
nuisance
tramping
through
his
streets
it
would
be
no
less
extraordinary
if
an
army
that
had
never
been
under
fire
did
not
regard
every
bullet
that
came
its
way
as
unauthorized
because
it
was
inconvenient
and
indeed
as
somehow
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
the
kriegspiel
which
then
constituted
its
only
experience
of
war
one
can
imagine
the
more
sensitive
bent
on
convincing
themselves
that
the
people
to
whom
they
were
doing
such
terrible
things
must
be
terrible
people
and
so
the
legend
may
have
been
spun
until
it
reached
the
censors
and
propagandists
who
whether
they
believed
it
or
not
saw
its
value
and
let
it
loose
on
the
german
civilians
they
too
were
not
altogether
sorry
to
find
that
the
people
they
were
outraging
were
and
above
all
since
the
legend
came
from
their
heroes
they
were
not
only
entitled
to
believe
it
they
were
unpatriotic
if
they
did
not
but
where
so
much
is
left
to
the
imagination
because
the
scene
of
action
is
lost
in
the
fog
of
war
there
is
no
check
and
no
control
the
legend
of
the
ferocious
belgian
priests
soon
tapped
an
old
hatred
for
in
the
minds
of
most
patriotic
protestant
germans
especially
of
the
upper
classes
the
picture
of
bismarck
victories
included
a
long
quarrel
with
the
roman
catholics
by
a
process
of
association
belgian
priests
became
priests
and
hatred
of
belgians
a
vent
for
all
their
hatreds
these
german
protestants
did
what
some
americans
did
when
under
the
stress
of
war
they
created
a
compound
object
of
hatred
out
of
the
enemy
abroad
and
all
their
opponents
at
home
against
this
synthetic
enemy
the
hun
in
germany
and
the
hun
within
the
gate
they
launched
all
the
animosity
that
was
in
them
the
catholic
resistance
to
the
atrocity
tales
was
of
course
defensive
it
was
aimed
at
those
particular
fictions
which
aroused
animosity
against
all
catholics
rather
than
against
belgian
catholics
alone
the
says
van
langenhove
had
only
an
ecclesiastical
bearing
and
confined
their
attention
almost
exclusively
to
the
reprehensible
acts
attributed
to
the
priests
and
yet
one
can
not
help
wondering
a
little
about
what
was
set
in
motion
in
the
minds
of
german
catholics
by
this
revelation
of
what
empire
meant
in
relation
to
them
and
also
whether
there
was
any
obscure
connection
between
that
knowledge
and
the
fact
that
the
prominent
german
politician
who
was
willing
in
the

thus
it

the

we
are

with
the

who
foozled

most
of
us
would
deal
with
affairs
through
a
rather
haphazard
and
shifting
assortment
of
stereotypes
if
a
comparatively
few
men
in
each
generation
were
not
constantly
engaged
in
arranging
standardizing
and
improving
them
into
logical
systems
known
as
the
laws
of
political
economy
the
principles
of
politics
and
the
like
generally
when
we
write
about
culture
tradition
and
the
group
mind
we
are
thinking
of
these
systems
perfected
by
men
of
genius
now
there
is
no
disputing
the
necessity
of
constant
study
and
criticism
of
these
idealized
versions
but
the
historian
of
people
the
politician
and
the
publicity
man
can
not
stop
there
for
what
operates
in
history
is
not
the
systematic
idea
as
a
genius
formulated
it
but
shifting
imitations
replicas
counterfeits
analogies
and
distortions
in
individual
minds
thus
marxism
is
not
necessarily
what
karl
marx
wrote
in
das
kapital
but
whatever
it
is
that
all
the
warring
sects
believe
who
claim
to
be
the
faithful
from
the
gospels
you
can
not
deduce
the
history
of
christianity
nor
from
the
constitution
the
political
history
of
america
it
is
das
kapital
as
conceived
the
gospels
as
preached
and
the
preachment
as
understood
the
constitution
as
interpreted
and
administered
to
which
you
have
to
go
for
while
there
is
a
reciprocating
influence
between
the
standard
version
and
the
current
versions
it
is
these
current
versions
as
distributed
among
men
which
affect
their
behavior

unfortunately
it
is

so
much
harder
to
know
this
actual

than
it
is
to
summarize
and
to
comment
upon
the

in
people

too
busy
to
indulge
in
the
strange
trade
of
formulating
their

they

it

no

that
scholars
who

precision
so
often
confine
their

to
the
neater
formulations
of
other
scholars
the
theory
of

says
a
critic
whose
eyelids
like
the
lady
lisa
are
a
little
weary
promises
to
develop
into
a
principle
as
adequate
to
universal
application
as
was
the
theory
of
evolution
this
latter
theory
from
being
a
technical
biological
hypothesis
became
an
inspiring
guide
to
workers
in
practically
every
branch
of

manners

electric

everything

very
general
term
it
also
became
imprecise

in
many
cases
the
original
definite
meaning
of
the
word
was
lost
and
the
theory
it
had
been
evoked
to
describe
was
misunderstood
we
are
hardy
enough
to
prophesy
a
similar
career
and
fate
for
the
theory
of
relativity
the
technical
physical
theory
at
present
imperfectly
understood
will
become
still
more
vague
and
dim
history
repeats
itself
and
relativity
like
evolution
after
receiving
a
number
of
intelligible
but
somewhat
inaccurate
popular
expositions
in
its
scientific
aspect
will
be
launched
on
a
career
we
suggest
that
by
that
time
it
will
probably
be
called
many
of
these
larger
applications
will
doubtless
be
justified
some
will
be
absurd
and
a
considerable
number
will
we
imagine
reduce
to
truisms
and
the
physical
theory
the
mere
seed
of
this
mighty
growth
will
become
once

the

technical

a

a

for

this

taken
up

imposed
an
optimistic
turn
upon

that
theory
of

is
as
professor
bury
says
neutral
between
pessimism
and
optimism
but
it
promised
continual
change
and
the
changes
visible
in
the
world
marked
such
extraordinary
conquests
of
nature
that
the
popular
mind
made
a

of
the
two
evolution
first
in
darwin
himself
and
then
more
elaborately
in
herbert
spencer
was
a
progress
towards

the
stereotype
represented
by
such
words
as
progress
and
perfection
was
composed
fundamentally
of
mechanical
inventions
and
mechanical
it
has
remained
on
the
whole
to
this
day
in
america
more
than
anywhere
else
the
spectacle
of
mechanical
progress
has
made
so
deep
an
impression
that
it
has
suffused
the
whole
moral
code
an
american
will
endure
almost
any
insult
except
the
charge
that
he
is
not
progressive
be
he
of
long
native
ancestry
or
a
recent
immigrant
the
aspect
that
has
always
struck
his
eye
is
the
immense
physical
growth

american
civilization
that
constitutes
a
fundamental
stereotype
through
which
he
views

so
not
every
american
of
course
sees
the
world
this
way
henry
adams
did
and
william
allen
white
does
but
those
men
do
who
in
the
magazines
devoted

appear
as
makers
of
america
they
mean
just
about
that
when
they
preach

progress
prosperity
being
constructive
the
american
way
of
doing
things
it
is
easy
to
laugh
but
in
fact
they
are
using
a
very
great
pattern
of
human
endeavor
for
one
thing
it
adopts
an
impersonal
criterion
for
another
it
adopts
an
earthly
criterion
for
a
third
it
is
habituating
men
to
think
quantitatively
to
be
sure
the
ideal
confuses
excellence
with
size
happiness
with
speed
and
human
nature
with
contraption
yet
the
same
motives
are
at
work
which
have
ever
actuated
any
moral
code
or
ever
will
the
desire
for
the
biggest
the
fastest
the
highest
or
if
you
are
a
maker
of
wristwatches

the
smallest
the
love
in

of
the
superlative
and
the
peerless
is
in
essence
and
possibility
a
noble
passion
certainly
the
american
version
of
progress
has
fitted
an
extraordinary
range
of
facts
in
the
economic
situation
and
in
human
nature
it
turned
an
unusual
amount
of
pugnacity
acquisitiveness
and
lust
of
power
into
productive
work
nor
has
it
until
more
recently
perhaps
seriously
frustrated
the
active
nature
of
the
active
members
of
the
community
they
have
made
a
civilization
which
provides
them
who
made
it
with
what
they
feel
to
be
ample
satisfaction
in
work
mating
and
play
and
the
rush
of
their
victory
over
mountains
wildernesses
distance
and
human
competition
has
even
done
duty
for
that
part
of
religious
feeling
which
is
a
sense
of
communion
with
the
purpose
of
the
universe
the
pattern
has
been
a
success
so
nearly
perfect
in
the
sequence
of
ideals
practice
and
results
that
any
challenge
to
it
is
called
and
yet
this
pattern
is
a
very
partial
and
inadequate
way
of
representing
the
world
the
habit
of
thinking
about
progress
as
development
has
meant
that
many
aspects
of
the

were

americans
have
in

mass
seen
little
that
did
not
accord
with
that
progress
they
saw
the
expansion
of
cities
but
not
the

of

they
cheered
the
census
statistics
but
refused
to
consider
overcrowding
they
pointed
with
pride
to
their
growth
but
would
not
see
the
drift
from
the
land
or
the
unassimilated
immigration
they
expanded
industry
furiously
at
reckless
cost
to
their
natural
resources
they
built
up
gigantic
corporations
without
arranging
for
industrial
relations
they
grew
to
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
nations
on
earth
without
preparing
their
institutions
or
their
minds
for
the
ending
of
their
isolation
they
stumbled
into
the
world
war
morally
and
physically
unready
and
they
stumbled
out

disillusioned
but
hardly
more
experienced
in

war
the
good
and
the
evil
influence
of
the
american
stereotype
was
plainly
visible
the
idea
that
the
war
could
be
won
by
recruiting
unlimited
armies
raising
unlimited
credits
building
an
unlimited
number
of
ships
producing
unlimited
munitions
and
concentrating
without
limit
on
these
alone
fitted
the
traditional
stereotype
and
resulted
in
something
like
a
physical
miracle

wesley

points
out
that
the
total
production
of
goods
after
our
entrance
into
the
war
did
not
greatly
increase
in
volume
over
that
of
the
year
but
that
production
for
war
purposes
did
increase
but
among
those
most
affected
by
the
stereotype
there
was
no
place
for
the
consideration
of
what
the
fruits
of
victory
were
or
how
they
were
to
be
attained
therefore
aims
were
ignored
or
regarded
as
automatic
and
victory
was
conceived
because
the
stereotype
demanded
it
as
nothing
but
an
annihilating
victory
in
the
field
in
peace
time
you
did
not
ask
what
the
fastest
motor
car
was
for
and
in

you
did
not
ask
what
the
completest
victory
was
for

the
pattern
did
not
fit

facts
in

you
can
go
on
endlessly
supplanting
small
things
with
big
ones
and
big
ones
with
bigger
ones
in
war
when
you
have
won
absolute
victory
you
can
not
go
on
to
a
more
absolute
victory
you
have
to
do
something
on
an
entirely
different
pattern
and
if
you
lack
such
a
pattern
the
end
of
the
war
is
to
you
what
it
was
to
so
many
good
people
an
anticlimax
in
a
dreary
and
savorless
world
this
marks
the
point
where
the
stereotype
and
the
facts
that
can
not
be
ignored
definitely
part
company
there
is
always
such
a
point
because
our
images
of
how
things
behave
are
simpler
and
more
fixed
than
the
ebb
and
flow
of
affairs
there
comes
a
time
therefore
when
the
blind
spots
come
from
the
edge
of
vision
into
the
center
then
unless
there
are
critics
who
have
the
courage
to
sound
an
alarm
and
leaders
capable
of
understanding
the
change
and
a

tolerant

instead
of
economizing

when
the

likely
as
not
that

he
has

against
most

had
made

turn

of

one
thing
is
common
to
these
cycles
there
is
in
each
set
of
stereotypes
a
point
where
effort
ceases
and
things
happen
of
their
own
accord
as
you
would
like
them
to
the
progressive
stereotype
powerful
to
incite
work
almost
completely
obliterates
the
attempt
to
decide
what
work
and
why
that
work
a
blessed
release
from
stupid
officialdom
assumes
that
men
will
move
by
spontaneous
combustion
towards
a
harmony
collectivism
an
antidote
to
ruthless
selfishness
seems
in
the
marxian
mind
to
suppose
an
economic
determinism
towards
efficiency
and
wisdom
on
the
part
of
socialist
officials
strong
government
imperialism
at
home
and
abroad
at
its
best
deeply
conscious
of
the
price
of
disorder
relies
at
last
on
the
notion
that
all
that
matters
to
the
governed
will
be
known
by
the
governors
in
each
theory
there
is
a
spot
of
blind
automatism
that
spot
covers
up
some
fact
which
if
it
were
taken
into
account
would
check
the
vital
movement
that
the
stereotype
provokes
if
the
progressive
had
to
ask
himself
like
the
chinaman
in
the
joke
what
he
wanted
to
do
with
the
time
he
saved
by
breaking
the
record
if
the
advocate
of
had
to
contemplate
not
only
free
and
exuberant
energies
of
men
but
what
some
people
call
their
human
nature
if
the
collectivist
let
the
center
of
his
attention
be
occupied
with
the
problem
of
how
he
is
to
secure
his
officials
if
the
imperialist
dared
to
doubt
his
own
inspiration
you

which
with
their

might
cause

and

consequently
the
stereotype
not
only
saves
time
in
a
busy
life
and
is
a
defense
of
our
position
in
society
but
tends
to
preserve
us
from
all
the
bewildering
effect
of
trying
to
see
the

steadily

see
it

anyone
who

recall
what
queer

he
mistook
for

the

in

in

a

sound

the
pealing

bell
the
distant
stroke
of
a
hammer
like
a
thunderclap
for
our
constellations
of
imagery
will
vibrate
to
a
stimulus
that
is
perhaps
but
vaguely
similar
to
some
aspect
of
them
they
may
in
hallucination
flood
the
whole
consciousness
they
may
enter
very
little
into
perception
though
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
such
an
experience
is
extremely
rare
and
highly
sophisticated
as
when
we
gaze
blankly
at
a
familiar
word
or
object
and
it
gradually
ceases
to
be
familiar
certainly
for
the
most
part
the
way
we
see
things
is
a
combination
of
what
is
there
and
of
what
we
expected
to
find
the
heavens
are
not
the
same
to
an
astronomer
as
to
a
pair
of
lovers
a
page
of
kant
will
start
a
different
train
of
thought
in
a
kantian
and
in
a
radical
empiricist
the
tahitian
belle
is
a
better
looking
person
to
her
tahitian
suitor
than
to
the
readers
of
the
geographic
expertness
in
any
subject
is
in
fact
a
multiplication
of
the
number
of
aspects
we
are
prepared
to
discover
plus
the
habit
of
discounting
our
expectations
where
to
the
ignoramus
all
things
look
alike
and
life
is
just
one
thing
after
another
to
the
specialist
things
are
highly
individual
for
a
chauffeur
an
epicure
a
connoisseur
a
member
of
the
president
cabinet
or
a
professor
wife
there
are
evident
distinctions
and
qualities
not
at
all
evident
to
the
casual
person
who
discusses
automobiles
wines
old
masters
republicans
and
college
faculties
but
in
our
public
opinions
few
can
be
expert
while
life
is
as
bernard
shaw
has
made
plain
so
short
those
who
are
expert
are
so
on
only
a
few
topics
even
among
the
expert
soldiers
as
we
learned
during
the
war
expert
cavalrymen
were
not
necessarily
brilliant
with
and
tanks
indeed
sometimes
a
little
expertness
on
a
small
topic
may
simply
exaggerate
our
normal
human
habit
of
trying
to
squeeze
into
our
stereotypes
all
that
can
be
squeezed
and
of
casting
into
outer
darkness
that
which
does
not
fit
whatever
we
recognize
as
familiar
we
tend
if
we
are
not
very
careful
to
visualize
with
the
aid
of
images
already
in
our
mind
thus
in
the
american
view
of
progress
and
success
there
is
a
definite
picture
of
human
nature
and
of
society
it
is
the
kind
of
human
nature
and
the
kind
of
society
which
logically
produce
the
kind
of
progress
that
is
regarded
as
ideal
and
then
when
we
seek
to
describe
or
explain
actually
successful
men
and
events
that
have
really
happened
we
read
back
into
them
the
qualities
that
are
presupposed
in
the
stereotypes
these
qualities
were
standardized
rather
innocently
by
the
older
economists
they
set
out
to
describe
the
social
system
under
which
they
lived
and
found
it
too
complicated
for
words
so
they
constructed
what
they
sincerely
hoped
was
a
simplified
diagram
not
so
different
in
principle
and
in
veracity
from
the
parallelogram
with
legs
and
head
in
a
child
drawing
of
a
complicated
cow
the
scheme
consisted
of
a
capitalist
who
had
diligently
saved
capital
from
his
labor
an
entrepreneur
who
conceived
a
socially
useful
demand
and
organized
a
factory
a
collection
of
workmen
who
freely
contracted
take
it
or
leave
it
for
their
labor
a
landlord
and
a
group
of
consumers
who
bought
in
the
cheapest
market
those
goods
which
by
the
ready
use
of
the
calculus
they
knew
would
give
them
the
most
pleasure
the
model
worked
the
kind
of
people
which
the
model
assumed
living
in
the
sort
of
world
the
model
assumed
invariably
coöperated
harmoniously
in
the
books
where
the
model
was
described
with
modification
and
embroidery
this
pure
fiction
used
by
economists
to
simplify
their
thinking
was
retailed
and
popularized
until
for
large
sections
of
the
population
it
prevailed
as
the
economic
mythology
of
the
day
it
supplied
a
standard
version
of
capitalist
promoter
worker
and
consumer
in
a
society
that
was
naturally
more
bent
on
achieving
success
than
on
explaining
it
the
buildings
which
rose
and
the
bank
accounts
which
accumulated
were
evidence
that
the
stereotype
of
how
the
thing
had
been
done
was
accurate
and
those
who
benefited
most
by
success
came
to
believe
they
were
the
kind
of
men
they
were
supposed
to
be
no
wonder
that
the
candid
friends
of
successful
men
when
they
read
the
official
biography
and
the
obituary
have
to
restrain
themselves
from
asking
whether
this
is
indeed
their
friend
to
the
vanquished
and
the
victims
the
official
portraiture
was
of
course
unrecognizable
for
while
those
who
exemplified
progress
did
not
often
pause
to
inquire
whether
they
had
arrived
according
to
the
route
laid
down
by
the
economists
or
by
some
other
just
as
creditable
the
unsuccessful
people
did
inquire
no
one

both
sides
of
the
argument
for
when

is
well
fixed
our
attention
is
called
to
those
facts
which
support
it
and
diverted
from
those
which
contradict
so
perhaps
it
is
because
they
are
attuned
to
find
it
that
kindly
people
discover
so
much
reason
for
kindness
malicious
people
so
much
malice
we
speak
quite
accurately
of
seeing
through
spectacles
or
with
a
jaundiced
eye
if
as
philip
littell
once
wrote
of
a
distinguished
professor
we
see
life
as
through
a
class
darkly
our
stereotypes
of
what
the
best
people
and
the
lower
classes
are
like
will
not
be
contaminated
by
understanding
what
is
alien
will
be
rejected
what
is
different
will
fall
upon
unseeing
eyes
we
do
not
see
what
our
eyes
are
not
accustomed
to
take
into
account
sometimes
consciously
more
often
without
knowing
it
we
are
impressed
by
those
facts
which
fit
our
philosophy
this
philosophy
is
a
more
or
less
organized
series
of
images
for
describing
the
unseen
world
but
not
only
for
describing
it
for
judging
it
as
well
and
therefore
the
stereotypes
are
loaded
with
preference
suffused
with
affection
or
dislike
attached
to
fears
lusts
strong
wishes
pride
hope
whatever
invokes
the
stereotype
is
judged
with
the
appropriate
sentiment
except
where
we
deliberately
keep
prejudice
in
suspense
we
do
not
study
a
man
and
judge
him
to
be
bad
we
see
a
bad
man
we
see
a
dewy
morn
a
blushing

a
sainted

a
humorless
englishman

in

workaday
world
that
is
often
the
real
judgment
long
in
advance
of
the
evidence
and
it
contains
within
itself
the
conclusion
which
the
evidence
is
pretty
certain
to
confirm
neither
justice
nor
mercy
nor
truth
enter
into
such
a
judgment
for
the
judgment
has
preceded
the
evidence
yet
a
people
without
prejudices
a
people
with
altogether
neutral
vision
is
so
unthinkable
in
any
civilization
of
which
it
is
useful
to
think
that
no
scheme
of
education
could
be
based
upon
that
ideal
prejudice
can
be
detected
discounted
and
refined
but
so
long
as
finite
men
must
compress
into
a
short
schooling
preparation
for
dealing
with
a
vast
civilization
they
must
carry
pictures
of
it
around
with
them
and
have
prejudices
the
quality
of
their
thinking
and
doing
will
depend
on
whether
those
prejudices
are
friendly
friendly
to
other
people
to
other
ideas
whether
they
evoke
love
of
what
is
felt
to
be
positively
good
rather
than
hatred
of
what
is
not
contained
in
their
version
of
the
good
morality
good
taste
and
good
form
first
standardize
and
then
emphasize
certain
of
these
underlying
prejudices
as
we
adjust
ourselves
to
our
code
we
adjust
the
facts
we
see
to
that
code
rationally
the
facts
are
neutral
to
all
our

makers
of

fix
upon

then
by

form

intuition
deduce
the

of
behavior
which
would
produce

they
acknowledge
the

apply
where
they
apply
but
in
daily
living
how
does
a
man
know
whether
his
predicament
is
the
one
the
had
in
mind
he
is
told
not
to
kill
but
if
his
children
are
attacked
may
he
kill
to
stop
a
killing
the
ten
commandments
are
silent
on
the
point
therefore
around
every
code
there
is
a
cloud
of
interpreters
who
deduce
more
specific
cases
suppose
then
that
the
doctors
of
the
law
decide
that
he
may
kill
in
for
the
next
man
the
doubt
is
almost
as
great
how
does
he
know
that
he
is
defining
correctly
or
that
he
has
not
misjudged
the
facts
imagined
the
attack
and
is
really
the
aggressor
perhaps
he
has
provoked
the
attack
but
what
is
a
provocation
exactly
these
confusions
infected
the
minds
of
most
germans
in
august
far
more
serious
in

than
any
difference
of

is
the
difference
in
the
assumptions
about
facts
to
which
the

is

religious
moral

are
nothing

truth
of
which
is
by
no

to
a
at
the
core
of
every
moral
code
there
is
a
picture
of
human
nature
a
map
of

universe
and
a
version
of

to

the
sort
conceived
in

of
the
kind

so
far
as
the
facts

of
the
environment
and
of
memory
are
different
by
so
far
the
rules
of
the
code
are
difficult
to
apply
with
success
now
every
moral
code
has
to
conceive
human
psychology
the
material
world
and
tradition
some
way
or
other
but
in
the
codes
that
are
under
the
influence
of
science
the
conception
is
known
to
be
an
hypothesis
whereas
in
the
codes
that
come
unexamined
from
the
past
or
bubble
up
from
the
caverns
of
the
mind
the
conception
is
not
taken
as
an
hypothesis
demanding
proof
or
contradiction
but
as
a
fiction
accepted
without
question
in
the
one
case
man
is
humble
about
his
beliefs
because
he
knows
they
are
tentative
and
incomplete
in
the
other
he
is
dogmatic
because
his
belief
is
a
completed
myth
the
moralist
who
submits
to
the
scientific
discipline
knows
that
though
he
does
not
know
everything
he
is
in
the
way
of
knowing
something
the
dogmatist
using
a
myth
believes
himself
to
share
part
of
the
insight
of
omniscience
though
he
lacks
the
criteria
by
which
to
tell
truth
from
error
for
the
distinguishing
mark
of
a
myth
is
that
truth
and
error
fact
and
fable
report
and
fantasy
are
all
on
the
same
plane
of
credibility
the
myth
is
then
not
necessarily
false
it
might
happen
to
be
wholly
true
it
may
happen
to
be
partly
true
if
it
has
affected
human
conduct
a
long
time
it
is
almost
certain
to
contain
much
that
is
profoundly
and
importantly
true
what
a
myth
never
contains
is
the
critical
power
to
separate
its
truths
from
its
errors
for
that
power
comes
only
by
realizing
that
no
human
opinion
whatever
its
supposed
origin
is
too
exalted
for
the
test
of
evidence
that
every
opinion
is
only
somebody
opinion
and
if
you
ask
why
the
test
of
evidence
is
preferable
to
any
other
there
is
no
answer
unless
you
are
willing
to
use
the
test
in
order
to
test
it
the
statement
is
i
think
susceptible
of
overwhelming
proof
that
moral
codes
assume
a
particular
view
of
the
facts
under
the
term
moral
codes
i
include
all
kinds
personal
family
economic
professional
legal
patriotic
international
at
the
center
of
each
there
is
a
pattern
of
stereotypes
about
psychology
sociology
and
history
the
same
view
of
human
nature
institutions
or
tradition
rarely
persists
through
all
our
codes
compare
for
example
the
economic
and
the
patriotic
codes
there
is
a
war
supposed
to
affect
all
alike
two
men
are
partners
in
business
one
enlists
the
other
takes
a
war
contract
the
soldier
sacrifices
everything
perhaps
even
his
life
he
is
paid
a
dollar
a
day
and
no
one
says
no
one
believes
that
you
could
make
a
better
soldier
out
of
him
by
any
form
of
economic
incentive
that
motive
disappears
out
of
his
human
nature
the
contractor
sacrifices
very
little
is
paid
a
handsome
profit
over
costs
and
few
say
or
believe
that
he
would
produce
the
munitions
if
there
were
no
economic
incentive
that
may
be
unfair
to
him
the
point
is
that
the
accepted
patriotic
code
assumes
one
kind
of
human
nature
the
commercial
code
another
and
the
codes
are
probably
founded
on
true
expectations
to
this
extent
that
when
a
man
adopts
a
certain
code
he
tends
to
exhibit
the
kind
of
human
nature
which
the
code
demands
that
is
one
reason
why
it
is
so
dangerous
to
generalize
about
human
nature
a
loving
father
can
be
a
sour
boss
an
earnest
municipal
reformer
and
a
rapacious
jingo
abroad
his
family
life
his
business
career
his
politics
and
his
foreign
policy
rest
on
totally
different
versions
of
what
others
are
like
and
of
how
he
should
act
these
versions
differ
by
codes
in
the
same
person
the
codes
differ
somewhat
among
persons
in
the
same
social
set
differ
widely
as
between
social
sets
and
between
two
nations
or
two
colors
may
differ
to
the
point
where
there
is
no
common
assumption
whatever
that
is
why
people
professing
the
same
stock
of
religious
beliefs
can
go
to
war
the
element
of
their
belief
which
determines
conduct
is
that
view
of
the
facts
which
they
assume
that
is
where
codes
enter
so
subtly
and
so
pervasively
into
the
making
of
public
opinion
the
orthodox
theory
holds
that
a
public
opinion
constitutes
a
moral
judgment
on
a
group
of
facts
the
theory
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
the
present
state
of
education
a
public
opinion
is
primarily
a
moralized
and
codified
version
of
the
facts
i
am
arguing
that
the
pattern
of
stereotypes
at
the
center
of
our
codes
largely
determines
what
group
of
facts
we
shall
see
and
in
what
light
we
shall
see
them
that
is
why
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
the
news
policy
of
a
journal
tends
to
support
its
editorial
policy
why
a
capitalist
sees
one
set
of
facts
and
certain
aspects
of
human
nature
literally
sees
them
his
socialist
opponent
another
set
and
other
aspects
and
why
each
regards
the
other
as
unreasonable
or
perverse
when
the
real
difference
between
them
is
a
difference
of
perception
that
difference
is
imposed
by
the
difference
between
the
capitalist
and
socialist
pattern
of
stereotypes
there
are
no
classes
in
america
writes
an
american
editor
the
history
of
all
hitherto
existing
society
is
the
history
of
class
struggles
says
the
communist
manifesto
if
you
have
the
editor
pattern
in
your
mind
you
will
see
vividly
the
facts
that
confirm
it
vaguely
and
ineffectively
those
that
contradict
if
you
have
the
communist
pattern
you
will
not
only
look
for
different
things
but
you
will
see
with
a
totally
different
emphasis
what
you
and
the
editor
happen
to
see
in
common
and
since
my
moral
system
rests
on
my
accepted
version
of
the
facts
he
who
denies
either
my
moral
judgments
or
my
version
of
the
facts
is
to
me
perverse
alien
dangerous
how
shall
i
account
for
him
the
opponent
has
always
to
be
explained
and
the
last
explanation
that
we
ever
look
for
is
that
he
sees
a
different
set
of
facts
such
an
explanation
we
avoid
because
it
saps
the
very
foundation
of
our
own
assurance
that
we
have
seen
life
steadily
and
seen
it
whole
it
is
only
when
we
are
in
the
habit
of
recognizing
our
opinions
as
a
partial
experience
seen
through
our
stereotypes
that
we
become
truly
tolerant
of
an
opponent
without
that
habit
we
believe
in
the
absolutism
of
our
own
vision
and
consequently
in
the
treacherous
character
of
all
opposition
for
while
men
are
willing
to
admit
that
there
are
two
sides
to
a
question
they
do
not
believe
that
there
are
two
sides
to
what
they
regard
as
a
fact
and
they
never
do
believe
it
until
after
long
critical
education
they
are
fully
conscious
of
how
and
subjective
is
their
apprehension
of
their
social
data
so
where
two
factions
see
vividly
each
its
own
aspect
and
contrive
their
own
explanations
of
what
they
see
it
is
almost
impossible
for
them
to
credit
each
other
with
honesty
if
the
pattern
fits
their
experience
at
a
crucial
point
they
no
longer
look
upon
it
as
an
interpretation
they
look
upon
it
as
reality
it
may
not
resemble
the
reality
except
that
it
culminates
in
a
conclusion
which
fits
a
real
experience
i
may
represent
my
trip
from
new
york
to
boston
by
a
straight
line
on
a
map
just
as
a
man
may
regard
his
triumph
as
the
end
of
a
straight
and
narrow
path
the
road
by
which
i
actually
went
to
boston
may
have
involved
many
detours
much
turning
and
twisting
just
as
his
road
may
have
involved
much
besides
pure
enterprise
labor
and
thrift
but
provided
i
reach
boston
and
he
succeeds
the
airline
and
the
straight
path
will
serve
as
ready
made
charts
only
when
somebody
tries
to
follow
them
and
does
not
arrive
do
we
have
to
answer
objections
if
we
insist
on
our
charts
and
he
insists
on
rejecting
them
we
soon
tend
to
regard
him
as
a
dangerous
fool
and
he
to
regard
us
as
liars
and
hypocrites
thus
we
gradually
paint
portraits
of
each
other
for
the
opponent
presents
himself
as
the
man
who
says
evil
be
thou
my
good
he
is
an
annoyance
who
does
not
fit
into
the
scheme
of
things
nevertheless
he
interferes
and
since
that
scheme
is
based
in
our
minds
on
incontrovertible
fact
fortified
by
irresistible
logic
some
place
has
to
be
found
for
him
in
the
scheme
rarely
in
politics
or
industrial
disputes
is
a
place
made
for
him
by
the
simple
admission
that
he
has
looked
upon
the
same
reality
and
seen
another
aspect
of
it
that
would
shake
the
whole
scheme
thus
to
the
italians
in
paris
fiume
was
italian
it
was
not
merely
a
city
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
include
within
the
italian
kingdom
it
was
italian
they
fixed
their
whole
mind
upon
the
italian
majority
within
the
legal
boundaries
of
the
city
itself
the
american
delegates
having
seen
more
italians
in
new
york
than
there
are
in
fiume
without
regarding
new
york
as
italian
fixed
their
eyes
on
fiume
as
a
central
european
port
of
entry
they
saw
vividly
the
jugoslavs
in
the
suburbs
and
the
hinterland
some
of
the
italians
in
paris
were
therefore
in
need
of
a
convincing
explanation
of
the
american
perversity
they
found
it
in
a
rumor
which
started
no
one
knows
where
that
an
influential
american
diplomat
was
in
the
snares
of
a
jugoslav
mistress
she
had
been
seen
he
had
been
seen
at
versailles
just
off
the
boulevard
the
villa
with
the
large
trees
this
is
a
rather
common
way
of
explaining
away
opposition
in
their
more
libelous
form
such
charges
rarely
reach
the
printed
page
and
a
roosevelt
may
have
to
wait
years
or
a
harding
months
before
he
can
force
an
issue
and
end
a
whispering
campaign
that
has
reached
into
every
circle

to
endure

fearful
amount
of
poisonous

would
willingly
have

it
happened
in

nation
that
the
war
party
which
was
in
control
of
the
foreign
office
the
high
command
and
most
of
the

had
claims
on

of

claims
were
called
the

ruritania

the
cultivated
classes

regarded
kipling
treitschke

as
one
hundred
percent
ruritanian

aroused

sectors

piece
they
invoked

stereotype
which
some
one
or
more
of
their

found
it
difficult
to
resist
because
that
ally
had
claims
for
which
it
hoped
to
find

was
inhabited
by
ruritanians
and
on
the
principle
that
no
people
ought
to
live
under
alien
rule
they
were
then
came
a
city
of
considerable
commercial
importance
not
inhabited
by
ruritanians
but
until
the
eighteenth
century
it
had
been
part
of
ruritania
and
on
the
principle
of
historic
right
it
was
annexed
farther
on
there
was
a
splendid
mineral
deposit
owned
by
aliens
and
worked
by
aliens
on
the
principle
of
reparation
for
damage
it
was
annexed
beyond
this
there
was
a
territory
inhabited
by
aliens
constituting
the
natural
geographical
frontier
of
another
nation
never
historically
a
part
of
ruritania
but
one
of
the
provinces
which
had
been
federated
into
ruritania
had
formerly
traded
in
those
markets
and
the
upper
class
culture
was
ruritanian
on
the
principle
of
cultural
superiority
and
the
necessity
of
defending
civilization
the
lands
were
claimed
finally
there
was
a
port
wholly
disconnected
from
ruritania
geographically
ethnically
economically
historically
traditionally
it
was
demanded
on
the
ground
that
it
was
needed
for
national
defense
in
the
treaties
that
concluded
the
great
war
you
can
multiply
examples
of
this
kind
now
i
do
not
wish
to
imply
that
i
think
it
was
possible
to
resettle
europe
consistently
on
any
one
of
these
principles
i
am
certain
that
it
was
not
the
very
use
of
these
principles
so
pretentious
and
so
absolute
meant
that
the
spirit
of
accommodation
did
not
prevail
and
that
therefore
the
substance
of
peace
was
not
there
for
the
moment
you
start
to
discuss
factories
mines
mountains
or
even
political
authority
as
perfect
examples
of
some
eternal
principle
or
other
you
are
not
arguing
you
are
fighting
that
eternal
principle
censors
out
all
the
objections
isolates
the
issue
from
its
background
and
its
context
and
sets
going
in
you
some
strong
emotion
appropriate
enough
to
the
principle
highly
inappropriate
to
the
docks
warehouses
and
real
estate
and
having
started
in
that
mood
you
can
not
stop
a
real
danger
exists
to
meet
it
you
have
to
invoke
more
absolute
principles
in
order
to
defend
what
is
open
to
attack
then
you
have
to
defend
the
defenses
erect
buffers
and
buffers
for
the
buffers
until
the
whole
affair
is
so
scrambled
that
it
seems
less
dangerous
to
fight
than
to
keep
on
talking
there
are
certain
clues
which
often
help
in
detecting
the
false
absolutism
of
a
stereotype
in
the
case
of
the
ruritanian
propaganda
the
principles
blanketed
each
other
so
rapidly
that
one
could
readily
see
how
the
argument
had
been
constructed
the
series
of
contradictions
showed
that
for
each
sector
that
stereotype
was
employed
which
would
obliterate
all
the
facts
that
interfered
with
the
claim
contradiction
of
this
sort
is
often
a
good
clue
inability
to
take
account
of
space
is
another
in
the
spring
of
for
example
large
numbers
of
people
appalled
by
the
withdrawal
of
russia
demanded
the
reestablishment
of
an
eastern
front
the
war
as
they
had
conceived
it
was
on
two
fronts
and
when
one
of
them
disappeared
there
was
an
instant
demand
that
it
be
recreated
the
unemployed
japanese
army
was
to
man
the
front
substituting
for
the
russian
but
there
was
one
insuperable
obstacle
between
vladivostok
and
the
eastern
battleline
there
were
five
thousand
miles
of
country
spanned
by
one
broken
down
railway
yet
those
five
thousand
miles
would
not
stay
in
the
minds
of
the
enthusiasts
so
overwhelming
was
their
conviction
that
an
eastern
front
was
needed
and
so
great
their
confidence
in
the
valor
of
the
japanese
army
that
mentally
they
had
projected
that
army
from
vladivostok
to
poland
on
a
magic
carpet
in
vain
our
military
authorities
argued
that
to
land
troops
on
the
rim
of
siberia
had
as
little
to
do
with
reaching
the
germans
as
climbing
from
the
cellar
to
the
roof
of
the
woolworth
building
had
to
do
with
reaching
the
moon
the
stereotype
in
this
instance
was
the
war
on
two
fronts
ever
since
men
had
begun
to
imagine
the
great
war
they
had
conceived
germany
held
between
france
and
russia
one
generation
of
strategists
and
perhaps
two
had
lived
with
that
visual
image
as
the
starting
point
of
all
their
calculations
for
nearly
four
years
every
they
saw
had
deepened
the
impression
that
this
was
the
war
when
affairs
took
a
new
turn
it
was
not
easy
to
see
them
as
they
were
then
they
were
seen
through
the
stereotype
and
facts
which
conflicted
with
it
such
as
the
distance
from
japan
to
poland
were
incapable
of
coming
vividly
into
consciousness
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
american
authorities
dealt
with
the
new
facts
more
realistically
than
the
french
in
part
this
was
because
previous
to
they
had
no
preconception
of
a
war
upon
the
continent
in
part
because
the
americans
engrossed
in
the
mobilization
of
their
forces
had
a
vision
of
the
western
front
which
was
itself
a
stereotype
that
excluded
from
consciousness
any
very
vivid
sense
of
the
other
theatres
of
war
in
the
spring
of
this
american
view
could
not
compete
with
the
traditional
french
view
because
while
the
americans
believed
enormously
in
their
own
powers
the
french
at
that
time
before
cantigny
and
the
second
marne
had
the
gravest
doubts
the
american
confidence
suffused
the
american
stereotype
gave
it
that
power
to
possess
consciousness
that
liveliness
and
sensible
pungency
that
stimulating
effect
upon
the
will
that
emotional
interest
as
an
object
of
desire
that
congruity
with
the
activity
in
hand
which
james
notes
as
characteristic
of
what
we
regard
as
real
footnote
of
vol
ii
p
the
french
in
despair
remained
fixed
on
their
accepted
image
and
when
facts
gross
geographical
facts
would
not
fit
with
the
preconception
they
were
either
censored
out
of
mind
or
the
facts
were
themselves
stretched
out
of
shape
thus
the
difficulty
of
the
japanese
reaching
the
germans
five
thousand
miles
away
was
in
measure
overcome
by
bringing
the
germans
more
than
half
way
to
meet
them
between
march
and
june
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
german
army
operating
in
eastern
siberia
this
phantom
army
consisted
of
some
german
prisoners
actually
seen
more
german
prisoners
thought
about
and
chiefly
of
the
delusion
that
those
five
thousand
intervening
miles
did
not
really
exist

absurd
complications
have
arisen
through
failure
to
conceive
the
practical
geography
of
a
region
under
some
general
formula
like
statesmen
have
at
various
times
drawn
lines
on
maps

when
surveyed
on

ran
through
the
middle
of
a
factory
down
the
center
of
a
village
street
diagonally
across
the
nave
of
a

between
the

of
a
peasant
cottage

have

time
no

fares
badly
a

is
that
of

man

elaborate

control

to
enjoy
the
large
patrimony
which
he
expected
to
bequeath
to
them
and
with
that
in
view
he
left
a
will
which
was
a
voluminous
compound
of
restraints

showed
thereby
how
great
were
both
his
confidence

his

the
desire
to
impose

is
a
very
human

human

and
then
because
constitutions
are
difficult
to
amend
zealous
people

a
taste

have
loved
to
write
on
this
imperishable
brass

kinds

rules

restrictions
that
given
any
decent
humility
about
the

ought
to
be
no
more
permanent
than

a
presumption

a
very
acute
sense

relative
time
distant
time
past

as
james
says
of
the
longer
duration
we
have
no
direct
sense
footnote

the
longest
duration
which
we
immediately
feel

what
is
called
the
specious
present
it
endures
according
to
titchener
for
about
six
seconds
footnote
cited
by
warren
p
all
impressions
within
this
period
of
time
are
present
to
us
this
makes
it
possible
for
us
to
perceive
changes
and
events
as
well
as
stationary
objects
the
perceptual
present
is
supplemented
by
the
ideational
present
through
the
combination
of
perceptions
with
memory
images
entire
days
months
and
even
years
of
the
past
are
brought
together
into
the
present
in
this
ideational
present
vividness
as
james
said
is
proportionate
to
the
number
of
discriminations
we
perceive
within
it
thus
a
vacation
in
which
we
were
bored
with
nothing
to
do
passes
slowly
while
we
are
in
it
but
seems
very
short
in
memory
great
activity
kills
time
rapidly
but
in
memory
its
duration
is
long
on
the
relation
between
the
amount
we
discriminate
and
our
time
perspective
james
has
an
interesting
passage
footnote
vol
i
p
we
have
every
reason
to
think
that
creatures
may
possibly
differ
enormously
in
the
amounts
of
duration
which
they
intuitively
feel
and
in
the
fineness
of
the
events
that
may
fill
it
von
baer
has
indulged
in
some
interesting
computations
of
the
effect
of
such
differences
in
changing
the
aspect
of
nature
suppose
we
were
able
within
the
length
of
a
second
to
note
events
distinctly
instead
of
barely
as
now
footnote
in
the
moving
picture
this
effect
is
admirably
produced
by
the
camera
if
our
life
were
then
destined
to
hold
the
same
number
of
impressions
it
might
be
times
as
short
we
should
live
less
than
a
month
and
personally
know
nothing
of
the
change
of
seasons
if
born
in
winter
we
should
believe
in
summer
as
we
now
believe
in
the
heats
of
the
carboniferous
era
the
motions
of
organic
beings
would
be
so
slow
to
our
senses
as
to
be
inferred
not
seen
the
sun
would
stand
still
in
the
sky
the
moon
be
almost
free
from
change
and
so
on

now
reverse
the
hypothesis
and
suppose
a
being
to
get
only
one
part
of
the
sensations
we
get
in
a
given
time
and
consequently
to
live
times
as
long
winters

right
when
he
insists
that
if

he
is

ask
for
any

of

he
is
thinking
of
the
salvaging

under

it
all
depends
upon
the
practical
purpose
for
which
you
adopt
the
measure
there
are
situations
when
the
time
perspective
needs
to
be
lengthened
and
others
when
it
needs
to
be
shortened
the

that
it
does
not
matter
if
chinese
die
of
famine
because
in
two
generations
the
birthrate
will
make
up
the
loss
has
used
a
time
perspective
to
excuse
his
inertia
a
person
who
pauperizes
a
healthy
young
man
because
he
is
sentimentally
overimpressed
with
an
immediate
difficulty
has
lost
sight
of
the
duration
of
the
beggar
life
the
people
who
for
the
sake
of
an
immediate
peace
are
willing
to
buy
off
an
aggressive
empire
by
indulging
its
appetite
have
allowed
a
specious
present
to
interfere
with
the
peace
of
their
children
the
people
who
will
not
be
patient
with
a
troublesome
neighbor
who
want
to
bring
everything
to
a
showdown
are
no
less
the
victims
of
a
specious
present
into
almost
every
social
problem
the
proper
calculation
of
time
enters
suppose
for
example
it
is
a
question
of
timber
some
trees
grow
faster
than
others
then
a
sound
forest
policy
is
one
in
which
the
amount
of
each
species
and
of
each
age
cut
in
each
season
is
made
good
by
replanting
in
so
far
as
that
calculation
is
correct
the
truest
economy
has
been
reached
to
cut
less
is
waste
and
to
cut
more
is
exploitation
but
there
may
come
an
emergency
say
the
need
for
aeroplane
spruce
in
a
war
when
the
year
allowance
must
be
exceeded
an
alert
government
will
recognize
that
and
regard
the
restoration
of
the
balance
as
a
charge
upon
the
future
coal
involves
a
different
theory
of
time
because
coal
unlike
a
tree
is
produced
on
the
scale
of
geological
time
the
supply
is
limited
therefore
a
correct
social
policy
involves
intricate
computation
of
the
available
reserves
of
the
world
the
indicated
possibilities
the
present
rate
of
use
the
present
economy
of
use
and
the
alternative
fuels
but
when
that
computation
has
been
reached
it
must
finally
be
squared
with
an
ideal
standard
involving
time
suppose
for
example
that
engineers
conclude
that
the
present
fuels
are
being
exhausted
at
a
certain
rate
that
barring
new
discoveries
industry
will
have
to
enter
a
phase
of
contraction
at
some
definite
time
in
the
future
we
have
then
to
determine
how
much
thrift
and
we
will
use
after
all
feasible
economies
have
been
exercised
in
order
not
to
rob
posterity
but
what
shall
we
consider
posterity
our
grandchildren
our
great
grandchildren
perhaps
we
shall
decide
to
calculate
on
a
hundred
years
believing
that
to
be
ample
time
for
the
discovery
of
alternative
fuels
if
the
necessity
is
made
clear
at
once
the
figures
are
of
course
hypothetical
but
in
calculating
that
way
we
shall
be
employing
what
reason
we
have
we
shall
be
giving
social
time
its
place
in
public
opinion
let
us
now
imagine
a
somewhat
different
case
a
contract
between
a
city
and
a
company
the
company
says
that
it
will
not
invest
its
capital
unless
it
is
granted
a
monopoly
of
the
main
highway
for
years
in
the
minds
of
the
men
who
make
that
demand
years
is
so
long
as
to
mean
forever
but
suppose
there
is
reason
to
think
that
surface
cars
run
from
a
central
power
plant
on
tracks
are
going
out
of
fashion
in
twenty
years
then
it
is
a
most
unwise
contract
to
make
for
you
are
virtually
condemning
a
future
generation
to
inferior
transportation
in
making
such
a
contract
the
city
officials
lack
a
realizing
sense
of
years
far
better
to
give
the
company
a
subsidy
now
in
order
to
attract
capital
than
to
stimulate
investment
by
indulging
a
fallacious
sense
of
eternity
no
city
official
and
no
company
official
has
a
sense
of
real
time
when
he
talks
about
years
popular
history
is
a
happy
hunting
ground
of
time
confusions
to
the
average
englishman
for
example
the
behavior
of
cromwell
the
corruption
of
the
act
of
union
the
famine
of
are
wrongs
suffered
by
people
long
dead
and
done
by
actors
long
dead
with
whom
no
living
person
irish
or
english
has
any
real
connection
but
in
the
mind
of
a
patriotic
irishman
these
same
events
are
almost
contemporary
his
memory
is
like
one
of
those
historical
paintings
where
virgil
and
dante
sit
side
by
side
conversing
these
perspectives
and
foreshortenings
are
a
great
barrier
between
peoples
it
is
ever
so
difficult
for
a
person
of
one
tradition
to
remember
what
is
contemporary
in
the
tradition
of
another
almost
nothing
that
goes
by
the
name
of
historic
rights
or
historic
wrongs
can
be
called
a
truly
objective
view
of
the
past
take
for
example
the
debate
about
it
all
depends
on
the
original
date
you
select
if
you
start
with
the
rauraci
and
sequani
the
lands
are
historically
part
of
ancient
gaul
if
you
prefer
henry
i
they
are
historically
a
german
territory
if
you
take
they
belong
to
the
house
of
austria
if
you
take
and
the
peace
of
westphalia
most
of
them
are
french
if
you
take
louis
xiv
and
the
year
they
are
almost
all
french
if
you
are
using
the
argument
from
history
you
are
fairly
certain
to
select
those
dates
in
the
past
which
support
your
view
of
what
should
be
done
now
arguments
about
races
and
nationalities
often
betray
the
same
arbitrary
view
of
time
during
the
war
under
the
influence
of
powerful
feeling
the
difference
between
teutons
on
the
one
hand
and
and
french
on
the
other
was
popularly
believed
to
be
an
eternal
difference
they
had
always
been
opposing
races
yet
a
generation
ago
historians
like
freeman
were
emphasizing
the
common
teutonic
origin
of
the
west
european
peoples
and
ethnologists
would
certainly
insist
that
the
germans
english
and
the
greater
part
of
the
french
are
branches
of
what
was
once
a
common
stock
the
general
rule
is
if
you
like
a
people
you
come
down
the
branches
to
the
trunk
if
you
dislike
them
you
insist
that
the
separate
branches
are
separate
trunks
in
one
case
you
fix
your
attention
on
the
period
before
they
were
distinguishable
in
the
other
on
the
period
after
which
they
became
distinct
and
the
view
which
fits
the
mood
is
taken
as
the
truth
an
amiable
variation
is
the
family
tree
usually
one
couple
are
appointed
the
original
ancestors
if
possible
a
couple
associated
with
an
honorific
event
like
the
norman
conquest
that
couple
have
no
ancestors
they
are
not
descendants
yet
they
were
the
descendants
of
ancestors
and
the
expression
that
was
the
founder
of
his
house
means
not
that
he
is
the
adam
of
his
family
but
that
he
is
the
particular
ancestor
from
whom
it
is
desirable
to
start
or
perhaps
the
earliest
ancestor
of
which
there
is
a
record
but
genealogical
tables
exhibit
a
deeper
prejudice
unless
the
female
line
happens
to
be
especially
remarkable
descent
is
traced
down
through
the
males
the
tree
is
male
at
various
moments
females
accrue
to
it
as
itinerant
bees
light
upon
an
ancient
apple
tree
but
the
future
is
the
most
illusive
time
of
all
our
temptation
here
is
to
jump
over
necessary
steps
in
the
sequence
and
as
we
are
governed
by
hope
or
doubt
to
exaggerate
or
to
minimize
the
time
required
to
complete
various
parts
of
a
process
the
discussion
of
the
role
to
be
exercised
by
in
the
management
of
industry
is
riddled
with
this
difficulty
for
management
is
a
word
that
covers
many
functions
footnote
cf
carter
goodrich
the
frontier
of
control
some
of
these
require
no
training
some
require
a
little
training
others
can
be
learned
only
in
a
lifetime
and
the
truly
discriminating
program
of
industrial
democratization
would
be
one
based
on
the
proper
time
sequence
so
that
the
assumption
of
responsibility
would
run
parallel
to
a
complementary
program
of
industrial
training
the
proposal
for
a
sudden
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
is
an
attempt
to
do
away
with
the
intervening
time
of
preparation
the
resistance
to
all
sharing
of
responsibility
an
attempt
to
deny
the
alteration
of
human
capacity
in
the
course
of
time
primitive
notions
of
democracy
such
as
rotation
in
office
and
contempt
for
the
expert
are
really
nothing
but
the
old
myth
that
the
goddess
of
wisdom
sprang
mature
and
fully
armed
from
the
brow
of
jove
they
assume
that
what
it
takes
years
to
learn
need
not
be
learned
at
all
whenever
the
phrase
backward
people
is
used
as
the
basis
of
a
policy
the
conception
of
time
is
a
decisive
element
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nations
says
footnote
article
xix
for
example
that
the
character
of
the
mandate
must
differ
according
to
the
stage
of
the
development
of
the
people
as
well
as
on
other
grounds
certain
communities
it
asserts
have
reached
a
stage
of
development
where
their
independence
can
be
provisionally
recognized
subject
to
advice
and
assistance
until
such
time
as
they
are
able
to
stand
alone
the
way
in
which
the
mandatories
and
the
mandated
conceive
that
time
will
influence
deeply
their
relations
thus
in
the
case
of
cuba
the
judgment
of
the
american
government
virtually
coincided
with
that
of
the
cuban
patriots
and
though
there
has
been
trouble
there
is
no
finer
page
in
the
history
of
how
strong
powers
have
dealt
with
the
weak
oftener
in
that
history
the
estimates
have
not
coincided
where
the
imperial
people
whatever
its
public
expressions
has
been
deeply
convinced
that
the
backwardness
of
the
backward
was
so
hopeless
as
not
to
be
worth
remedying
or
so
profitable
that
it
was
not
desirable
to
remedy
it
the
tie
has
festered
and
poisoned
the
peace
of
the
world
there
have
been
a
few
cases
very
few
where
backwardness
has
meant
to
the
ruling
power
the
need
for
a
program
of
forwardness
a
program
with
definite
standards
and
definite
estimates
of
time
far
more
frequently
so
frequently
in
fact
as
to
seem
the
rule
backwardness
has
been
conceived
as
an
intrinsic
and
eternal
mark
of
inferiority
and
then
every
attempt
to
be
less
backward
has
been
frowned
upon
as
the
sedition
which
under
these
conditions
it
undoubtedly
is
in
our
own
race
wars
we
can
see
some
of
the
results
of
the
failure
to
realize
that
time
would
gradually
obliterate
the
slave
morality
of
the
negro
and
that
social
adjustment
based
on
this
morality
would
begin
to
break
down
it
is
hard
not
to
picture
the
future
as
if
it
obeyed
our
present
purposes
to
annihilate
whatever
delays
our
desire
or
immortalize
whatever
stands
between
us
and
our
fears
in
putting
together
our
public
opinions
not
only
do
we
have
to
picture
more
space
than
we
can
see
with
our
eyes
and
more
time
than
we
can
feel
but
we
have
to
describe
and
judge
more
people
more
actions
more
things
than
we
can
ever
count
or
vividly
imagine
we
have
to
summarize
and
generalize
we
have
to
pick
out
samples
and
treat
them
as
typical
to
pick
fairly
a
good
sample
of
a
large
class
is
not
easy
the
problem
belongs
to
the
science
of
statistics
and
it
is
a
most
difficult
affair
for
anyone
whose
mathematics
is
primitive
and
mine
remain
azoic
in
spite
of
the
half
dozen
manuals
which
i
once
devoutly
imagined
that
i
understood
all
they
have
done
for
me
is
to
make
me
a
little
more
conscious
of
how
hard
it
is
to
classify
and
to
sample
how
readily
we
spread
a
little
butter
over
the
whole
universe
some
time
ago
a
group
of
social
workers
in
sheffield
england
started
out
to
substitute
an
accurate
picture
of
the
mental
equipment
of
the
workers
of
that
city
for
the
impressionistic
one
they
had
footnote
equipment
of
the
they
wished
to
say
with
some
decent
grounds
for
saying
it
how
the
workers
of
sheffield
were
equipped
they
found
as
we
all
find
the
moment
we
refuse
to
let
our
first
notion
prevail
that
they
were
beset
with
complications
of
the
test
they
employed
nothing
need
be
said
here
except
that
it
was
a
large
questionnaire
for
the
sake
of
the
illustration
assume
that
the
questions
were
a
fair
test
of
mental
equipment
for
english
city
life
theoretically
then
those
questions
should
have
been
put
to
every
member
of
the
working
class
but
it
is
not
so
easy
to
know
who
are
the
working
class
however
assume
again
that
the
census
knows
how
to
classify
them
then
there
were
roughly
men
and
women
who
ought
to
have
been
questioned
they
possessed
the
answers
which
would
justify
or
refute
the
casual
phrase
about
the
ignorant
workers
or
the
intelligent
workers
but
nobody
could
think
of
questioning
the
whole
two
hundred
thousand
so
the
social
workers
consulted
an
eminent
statistician
professor
bowley
he
advised
them
that
not
less
than
men
and
women
would
prove
to
be
a
fair
sample
according
to
mathematical
calculation
this
number
would
not
show
a
greater
deviation
from
the
average
than
in
footnote
p
they
had
therefore
to
question
at
least
people
before
they
could
pretend
to
talk
about
the
average
workingman
but
which
people
should
they
approach
we
might
have
gathered
particulars
concerning
workers
to
whom
one
or
another
of
us
had
a
access
we
might
have
worked
through
philanthropic
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
were
in
contact
with
certain
sections
of
workers
at
a
club
a
mission
an
infirmary
a
place
of
worship
a
settlement
but
such
a
method
of
selection
would
produce
entirely
worthless
results
the
workers
thus
selected
would
not
be
in
any
sense
representative
of
what
is
popularly
called
average
run
of
workers
they
would
represent
nothing
but
the
little
coteries
to
which
they
belonged
the
right
way
of
securing
to
which
at
immense
cost
of
time
and
labour
we
rigidly
adhered
is
to
get
hold
of
your
workers
by
some
or
or
method
of
approach
this
they
did
and
after
all
these
precautions
they
came
to
no
more
definite
conclusion
than
that
on
their
classification
and
according
to
their
questionnaire
among
sheffield
workers
about
one
quarter
were
well
equipped
approaching
were
inadequately
equipped
and
that
about
were
compare
this
conscientious
and
almost
pedantic
method
of
arriving
at
an
opinion
with
our
usual
judgments
about
masses
of
people
about
the
volatile
irish
and
the
logical
french
and
the
disciplined
germans
and
the
ignorant
slavs
and
the
honest
chinese
and
the
untrustworthy
japanese
and
so
on
and
so
on
all
these
are
generalizations
drawn
from
samples
but
the
samples
are
selected
by
a
method
that
statistically
is
wholly
unsound
thus
the
employer
will
judge
labor
by
the
most
troublesome
employee
or
the
most
docile
that
he
knows
and
many
a
radical
group
has
imagined
that
it
was
a
fair
sample
of
the
working
class
how
many
women
views
on
the
servant
question
are
little
more
than
the
reflection
of
their
own
treatment
of
their
servants
the
tendency
of
the
casual
mind
is
to
pick
out
or
stumble
upon
a
sample
which
supports
or
defies
its
prejudices
and
then
to
make
it
the
representative
of
a
whole
class
a
great
deal
of
confusion
arises
when
people
decline
to
classify
themselves
as
we
have
classified
them
prophecy
would
be
so
much
easier
if
only
they
would
stay
where
we
put
them
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
phrase
like
the
working
class
will
cover
only
some
of
the
truth
for
a
part
of
the
time
when
you
take
all
the
people
below
a
certain
level
of
income
and
call
them
the
working
class
you
can
not
help
assuming
that
the
people
so
classified
will
behave
in
accordance
with
your
stereotype
just
who
those
people
are
you
are
not
quite

or
less

this
truism
is
inordinately
difficult
to
live
by
because
every
one
of

is
so
little
trained
in
the
selection
of
our
samples
if
we
believe
that
a
certain
thing
ought
to
be
true
we
can
almost
always
find
either
an
instance
where
it
is
true
or
someone
who
believes
it
ought
to
be
true
it
is
ever
so
hard
when
a
concrete
fact
illustrates
a
hope
to
weigh
that
fact
properly
when
the
first
six
people
we
meet
agree
with
us
it
is
not
easy
to
remember
that
they
may
all
have
read
the

newspaper
at
breakfast
and
yet
we
can
not
send
out
a
questionnaire
to
random
samples
every
time
we
wish
to
estimate
a
probability
in
dealing
with
any
large
mass
of
facts
the
presumption
is
against
our
having
picked
true
samples
if
we
are
acting
on
a
casual
impression
and
when
we
try
to
go
one
step
further
in

to
seek
the
causes

unseen

complicated
affairs
haphazard
opinion
is
very
tricky
there
are
few
big
issues
in
public
life
where
cause
and
effect
are
obvious
at
once
they
are
not
obvious
to
scholars
who
have
devoted
years

to
studying
business
cycles
or
price
and
wage
movements
or
the
migration
and
the
assimilation
of
peoples
or
the
diplomatic
purposes
of
foreign
powers
yet
somehow
we
are
all
supposed
to
have
opinions
on
these
matters
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
commonest
form
of
reasoning
is
the
intuitive
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
the
more
untrained
a
mind
the
more
readily
it
works
out
a
theory
that
two
things
which
catch
its
attention
at
the
same
time
are
causally
connected
we
have
already
dwelt
at
some
length
on
the
way
things
reach
our
attention
we
have
seen
that
our
access
to
information
is
obstructed
and
uncertain
and
that
our
apprehension
is
deeply
controlled
by
our
stereotypes
that
the
evidence
available
to
our
reason
is
subject
to
illusions
of
defense
prestige
morality
space
time
and
sampling
we
must
note
now
that
with
this
initial
taint
public
opinions
are
still
further
beset
because
in
a
series
of
events
seen
mostly
through
stereotypes
we
readily
accept
sequence
or
parallelism
as
equivalent
to
cause
and
effect
this
is
most
likely
to
happen
when
two
ideas
that
come
together
arouse
the
same
feeling
if
they
come
together
they
are
likely
to
arouse
the
same
feeling
and
even
when
they
do
not
arrive
together
a
powerful
feeling
attached
to
one
is
likely
to
suck
out
of
all
the
corners
of
memory
any
idea
that
feels
about
the

everything

the
deepest
of

the
human

imputes
human

things
the
bewildering
variety
of
our
impressions
even
after
they
have
been
censored
in
all
kinds
of
ways
tends
to
force
us
to
adopt
the
greater
economy
of
the
allegory
so
great
is
the
multitude
of
things
that
we
can
not
keep
them
vividly
in
mind
usually
then
we
name
them
and
let
the
name
stand
for
the
whole
impression
but
a
name
is
porous
old
meanings
slip
out
and
new
ones
slip
in
and
the
attempt
to
retain
the
full
meaning
of
the
name
is
almost
as
fatiguing
as
trying
to
recall
the
original
impressions
yet
names
are
a
poor
currency
for
thought
they
are
too
empty
too
abstract
too
inhuman
and
so
we
begin
to
see
the
name
through
some
personal
stereotype
to
read
into
it
finally
to
see
in
it
the
incarnation
of
some
human
quality
yet
human
qualities
are
themselves
vague
and
fluctuating
they
are
best
remembered
by
a
physical
sign
and
therefore
the
human
qualities
we
tend
to
ascribe
to
the
names
of
our
impressions
themselves
tend
to
be
visualized
in
physical
metaphors

their
transformation
into

requires
first
abstraction
from
the
original
and
then
animation
of
what
has
been
abstracted
we
can
not
be
much
interested
in
or
much
moved
by
the
things
we
do
not
see
of

each
of
us
sees
very
little
and
therefore
they
remain
dull
and
unappetizing
until
somebody
with
the
makings
of
an
artist
has
translated
them
into
a
moving
picture
thus
the
abstraction
imposed
upon
our
knowledge
of
reality
by
all
the
limitations
of
our
access
and
of
our
prejudices
is
compensated

a
clear
thinker
is
almost
always
a
good
visualizer
but
for
that
same
reason
because
he
is
cinematographic
he
is
often
by
that
much
external
and
insensitive
for
the
people
who
have
intuition
which
is
probably
another
name
for
musical
or
muscular
perception
often
appreciate
the
quality
of
an
event
and
the
inwardness
of
an
act
far
better
than
the
visualizer
they
have
more
understanding
when
the
crucial
element
is
a
desire
that
is
never
crudely
overt
and
appears
on
the
surface
only
in
a
veiled
gesture
or
in
a
rhythm
of
speech
visualization
may
catch
the
stimulus
and
the
result
but
the
intermediate
and
internal
is
often
as
badly
caricatured
by
a
visualizer
as
is
the
intention
of
the
composer
by
an
enormous
soprano
in
the
sweet
maiden
part
nevertheless
though
they
have
often
a
peculiar
justice
intuitions
remain
highly
private
and
largely
incommunicable
but
social
intercourse
depends
on
communication
and
while
a
person
can
often
steer
his
own
life
with
the
utmost
grace
by
virtue
of
his
intuitions
he
usually
has
great
difficulty
in
making
them
real
to
others
when
he
talks
about
them
they
sound
like
a
sheaf
of
mist
for
while
intuition
does
give
a
fairer
perception
of
human
feeling
the
reason
with
its
spatial
and
tactile
prejudice
can
do
little
with
that
perception
therefore
where
action
depends
on
whether
a
number
of
people
are
of
one
mind
it
is
probably
true
that
in
the
first
instance
no
idea
is
lucid
for
practical
decision
until
it
has
visual
or
tactile
value
but
it
is
also
true
that
no
visual
idea
is
significant
to
us
until
it
has
enveloped
some
stress
of
our
own
personality
until
it
releases
or
resists
depresses
or
enhances
some
craving
of
our
own
it
remains
one
of
the
objects
which
do
not
matter

have
always
been
the
surest
way
of
conveying
an
idea
and
next
in

words
that
call
up
pictures
in
memory
but
the
idea
conveyed
is
not
fully
our
own
until
we
have
identified
ourselves
with
some
aspect
of
the
picture
the
identification
or
what
vernon
lee
has
called
empathy
footnote
and
may
be
almost
infinitely
subtle
and
symbolic
the
mimicry
may
be
performed
without
our
being
aware
of
it
and
sometimes
in
a
way
that
would
horrify
those
sections
of
our
personality
which
support
our
in
sophisticated
people
the
participation
may
not
be
in
the
fate
of
the
hero
but
in
the
fate
of
the
whole
idea
to
which
both
hero
and
villain
are
essential
but
these
are
refinements
in
popular
representation
the
handles
for
identification
are
almost
always
marked
you
know
who
the
hero
is
at

promises
to
be

popular

the
image
now
there
are
two
forms
of
exercise
which
far
transcend
all
others
both
as
to
ease
with
which
they
are
aroused
and
eagerness
with
which
stimuli
for
them
are
sought
they
are
sexual
passion
and
fighting
and
the
two
have
so
many
associations
with
each

blend
into
each
other
so
intimately
that

outranks

is

to

there
are

none

the

the

principle
or

for
the

insists
that
suspense
constitutes
the
difference
between
the
masterpieces
in
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art
and
the
pictures
at
the
rivoli
or
the
rialto
theatres
had
she
made
it
clear
that
the
masterpieces
lack
either
an
easy
mode
of
identification
or
a
theme
popular
for
this
generation
she
would
be
wholly
right
in
saying
that
this
explains
why
the
people
straggle
into
the
metropolitan
by
twos
and
threes
and
struggle
into
the
rialto
and
rivoli
by
hundreds
the
twos
and
threes
look
at
a
picture
in
the
art
museum
for
less
than
ten
minutes
unless
they
chance
to
be
art
students
critics
or
connoisseurs
the
hundreds
in
the
rivoli
or
the
rialto
look
at
the
picture
for
more
than
an
hour
as
far
as
beauty
is
concerned
there
can
be
no
comparison
of
the
merits
of
the
two
pictures
yet
the
motion
picture
draws
more
people
and
holds
them
at
attention
longer
than
do
the
masterpieces
not
through
any
intrinsic
merit
of
its
own
but
because
it
depicts
unfolding
events
the
outcome
of
which
the
audience
is
breathlessly
waiting
it
possesses
the
element
of
struggle
which
never
fails
to
arouse
suspense
in
order
then
that
the
distant
situation
shall
not
be
a
gray
flicker
on
the
edge
of
attention
it
should
be
capable
of
translation
into
pictures
in
which
the
opportunity
for
identification
is
recognizable
unless
that
happens
it
will
interest
only
a
few
for
a
little
while
it
will
belong
to
the
sights
seen
but
not
felt
to
the
sensations
that
beat
on
our
sense
organs
and
are
not
acknowledged
we
have
to
take
sides
we
have
to
be
able
to
take
sides
in
the
recesses
of
our
being
we
must
step
out
of
the
audience
on
to
the
stage
and
wrestle
as
the
hero
for
the
victory
of
good
over
evil
we
must
breathe
into
the
allegory
the
breath
of
our
life
and
so
in
spite
of
the
critics
a
verdict
is
rendered
in
the
old
controversy
about
realism
and
romanticism
our
popular
taste
is
to
have
the
drama
originate
in
a
setting
realistic
enough
to
make
identification
plausible
and
to
have
it
terminate
in
a
setting
romantic
enough
to
be
desirable
but
not
so
romantic
as
to
be
inconceivable
in
between
the
beginning
and
the
end
the
canons
are
liberal
but
the
true
beginning
and
the
happy
ending
are
landmarks
the
moving
picture
audience
rejects
fantasy
logically
developed
because
in
pure
fantasy
there
is
no
familiar
foothold
in
the
age
of
machines
it
rejects
realism
relentlessly
pursued
because
it
does
not
enjoy
defeat
in
a
struggle
that
has
become
its
own
what
will
be
accepted
as
true
as
realistic
as
good
as
evil
as
desirable
is
not
eternally
fixed
these
are
fixed
by
stereotypes
acquired
from
earlier
experiences
and
carried
over
into
judgment
of
later
ones
and
therefore
if
the
financial
investment
in
each
film
and
in
popular
magazines
were
not
so
exorbitant
as
to
require
instant
and
widespread
popularity
men
of
spirit
and
imagination
would
be
able
to
use
the
screen
and
the
periodical
as
one
might
dream
of
their
being
used
to
enlarge
and
to
refine
to
verify
and
criticize
the
repertory
of
images
with
which
our
imaginations
work
but
given
the
present
costs
the
men
who
make
moving
pictures
like
the
church
and
the
court
painters
of
other
ages
must
adhere
to
the
stereotypes
that
they
find
or
pay
the
price
of
frustrating
expectation
the
stereotypes
can
be
altered
but
not
in
time
to
guarantee
success
when
the
film
is
released
six
months
from
now
the
men
who
do
alter
the
stereotypes
the
pioneering
artists
and
critics
are
naturally
depressed
and
angered
at
managers
and
editors
who
protect
their
investments
they
are
risking
everything
then
why
not
the
others
that
is
not
quite
fair
for
in
their
righteous
fury
they
have
forgotten
their
own
rewards
which
are
beyond
any
that
their
employers
can
hope
to
feel
they
could
not
and
would
not
if
they
could
change
places
and
they
have
forgotten
another
thing
in
the
unceasing
war
with
philistia
they
have
forgotten
that
they
are
measuring
their
own
success
by
standards
that
artists
and
wise
men
of
the
past
would
never
have
dreamed
of
invoking
they
are
asking
for
circulations
and
audiences
that
were
never
considered
by
any
artist
until
the
last
few
generations
and
when
they
do
not
get
them
they
are
disappointed
those
who
catch
on
like
sinclair
lewis
in
main
street
are
men
who
have
succeeded
in
projecting
definitely
what
great
numbers
of
other
people
were
obscurely
trying
to
say
inside
their
heads
you
have
said
it
for
me
they
establish
a
new
form
which
is
then
endlessly
copied
until
it
too
becomes
a
stereotype
of
perception
the
next
pioneer
finds
it
difficult
to
make
the
public
see
main
street
any
other
way
and
he
like
the
forerunners
of
sinclair
lewis
has
a
quarrel
with
the
public
this
quarrel
is
due
not
only
to
the
conflict
of
stereotypes
but
to
the
pioneering
artist
reverence
for
his
material
whatever
the
plane
he
chooses
on
that
plane
he
remains
if
he
is
dealing
with
the
inwardness
of
an
event
he
follows
it
to
its
conclusion
regardless
of
the
pain
it
causes
he
will
not
tag
his
fantasy
to
help
anyone
or
cry
peace
where
there
is
no
peace
there
is
his
america
but
big
audiences
have
no
stomach
for
such
severity
they
are
more
interested
in
themselves
than
in
anything
else
in
the
world
the
selves
in
which
they
are
interested
are
the
selves
that
have
been
revealed
by
schools
and
by
tradition
they
insist
that
a
work
of
art
shall
be
a
vehicle
with
a
step
where
they
can
climb
aboard
and
that
they
shall
ride
not
according
to
the
contours
of
the
country
but
to
a
land
where
for
an
hour
there
are
no
clocks
to
punch
and
no
dishes
to
to
satisfy
these
demands
there
exists
an
intermediate
class
of
artists
who
are
able
and
willing
to
confuse
the
planes
to
piece
together
a
compound
out
of
the
inventions
of
greater
men
and
as
miss
patterson
advises
give
what
real
life
so
rarely
triumphant
resolution
of
a
set
of
difficulties
the
anguish
of
virtue
and
the
triumph
of
sin
changed
to
the
glorifications
of
virtue
and
the
eternal
punishment
of
its
enemy
footnote
the
hero
and
heroine
must
in
general
possess
youth
beauty
goodness
exalted
and
unalterable
constancy
the
ideologies
of
politics
obey
these
rules
the
foothold
of
realism
is
always
there
the
picture
of
some
real
evil
such
as
the
german
threat
or
class
conflict
is
recognizable
in
the
argument
there
is
a
description
of
some
aspect
of
the
world
which
is
convincing
because
it
agrees
with
familiar
ideas
but
as
the
ideology
deals
with
an
unseen
future
as
well
as
with
a
tangible
present
it
soon
crosses
imperceptibly
the
frontier
of
verification
in
describing
the
present
you
are
more
or
less
tied
down
to
common
experience
in
describing
what
nobody
has
experienced
you
are
bound
to
let
go
you
stand
at
armageddon
more
or
less
but
you
battle
for
the
lord
perhaps
a
true
beginning
true
according
to
the
standards
prevailing
and
a
happy
ending
every
marxist
is
hard
as
nails
about
the
brutalities
of
the
present
and
mostly
sunshine
about
the
day
after
the
dictatorship
so
were
the
war
propagandists
there
was
not
a
bestial
quality
in
human
nature
they
did
not
find
everywhere
east
of
the
rhine
or
west
of
it
if
they
were
germans
the
bestiality
was
there
all
right
but
after
the
victory
eternal
peace
plenty
of
this
is
quite
cynically
deliberate
for
the
skilful
propagandist
knows
that
while
you
must
start
with
a
plausible
analysis
you
must
not
keep
on
analyzing
because
the
tedium
of
real
political
accomplishment
will
soon
destroy
interest
so
the
propagandist
exhausts
the
interest
in
reality
by
a
tolerably
plausible
beginning
and
then
stokes
up
energy
for
a
long
voyage
by
brandishing
a
passport
to
heaven
the
formula
works
when
the
public
fiction
enmeshes
itself
with
a
private
urgency
but
once
enmeshed
in
the
heat
of
battle
the
original
self
and
the
original
stereotype
which
effected
the
junction
may
be
wholly
lost
to
sight
chapter
xii
reconsidered
therefore
the
identical
story
is
not
the
same
story
to
all
who
hear
it
each
will
enter
it
at
a
slightly
different
point
since
no
two
experiences
are
exactly
alike
he
will
reenact
it
in
his
own
way
and
transfuse
it
with
his
own
feelings
sometimes
an
artist
of
compelling
skill
will
force
us
to
enter
into
lives
altogether
unlike
our
own
lives
that
seem
at
first
glance
dull
repulsive
or
eccentric
but
that
is
rare
in
almost
every
story
that
catches
our
attention
we
become
a
character
and
act
out
the
role
with
a
pantomime
of
our
own
the
pantomime
may
be
subtle
or
gross
may
be
sympathetic
to
the
story
or
only
crudely
analogous
but
it
will
consist
of
those
feelings
which
are
aroused
by
our
conception
of
the
role
and
so
the
original
theme
as
it
circulates
is
stressed
twisted
and
embroidered
by
all
the
minds
through
which
it
goes
it
is
as
if
a
play
of
shakespeare
were
rewritten
each
time
it
is
performed
with
all
the
changes
of
emphasis
and
meaning
that
the
actors
and
audience
inspired
something
very
like
that
seems
to
have
happened
to
the
stories
in
the
sagas
before
they
were
definitively
written
down
in
our
time
the
printed
record
such
as
it
is
checks
the
exuberance
of
each
individual
fancy
but
against
rumor
there
is
little
or
no
checks
and
the
original
story
true
or
invented
grows
wings
and
horns
hoofs
and
beaks
as
the
artist
in
each
gossip
works
upon
it
the
first
narrator
account
does
not
keep
its
shape
and
proportions
it
is
edited
and
revised
by
all
who
played
with
it
as
they
heard
it
used
it
for
day
dreams
and
passed
it
on
footnote
for
an
interesting
example
see
the
case
described
by
jung
für
vol
i
translated
by
constance
long
in
ch
iv
consequently
the
more
mixed
the
audience
the
greater
will
be
the
variation
in
the
response
for
as
the
audience
grows
larger
the
number
of
common
words
diminishes
thus
the
common
factors
in
the
story
become
more
abstract
this
story
lacking
precise
character
of
its
own
is
heard
by
people
of
highly
varied
character
they
give
it
their
own
character
the
character
they
give
it
varies
not
only
with
sex
and
age
race
and
religion
and
social
position
but
within
these
cruder
classifications
according
to
the
inherited
and
acquired
constitution
of
the
individual
his
faculties
his
career
the
progress
of
his
career
an
emphasized
aspect
of
his
career
his
moods
and
tenses
or
his
place
on
the
board
in
any
of
the
games
of
life
that
he
is
playing
what
reaches
him
of
public
affairs
a
few
lines
of
print
some
photographs
anecdotes
and
some
casual
experience
of
his
own
he
conceives
through
his
set
patterns
and
recreates
with
his
own
emotions
he
does
not
take
his
personal
problems
as
partial
samples
of
the
greater
environment
he
takes
his
stories
of
the
greater
environment
as
a
mimic
enlargement
of
his
private
life
but
not
necessarily
of
that
private
life
as
he
would
describe
it
to
himself
for
in
his
private
life
the
choices
are
narrow
and
much
of
himself
is
squeezed
down
and
out
of
sight
where
it
can
not
directly
govern
his
outward
behavior
and
thus
beside
the
more
average
people
who
project
the
happiness
of
their
own
lives
into
a
general
good
will
or
their
unhappiness
into
suspicion
and
hate
there
are
the
outwardly
happy
people
who
are
brutal
everywhere
but
in
their
own
circle
as
well
as
the
people
who
the
more
they
detest
their
families
their
friends
their
jobs
the
more
they
overflow
with
love
for
mankind
as
you
descend
from
generalities
to
detail
it
becomes
more
apparent
that
the
character
in
which
men
deal
with
their
affairs
is
not
fixed
possibly
their
different
selves
have
a
common
stem
and
common
qualities
but
the
branches
and
the
twigs
have
many
forms
nobody
confronts
every
situation
with
the
same
character
his
character
varies
in
some
degree
through
the
sheer
influence
of
time
and
accumulating
memory
since
he
is
not
an
automaton
his
character
varies
not
only
in
time
but
according
to
circumstance
the
legend
of
the
solitary
englishman
in
the
south
seas
who
invariably
shaves
and
puts
on
a
black
tie
for
dinner
bears
witness
to
his
own
intuitive
and
civilized
fear
of
losing
the
character
which
he
has
acquired
so
do
diaries
and
albums
and
souvenirs
old
letters
and
old
clothes
and
the
love
of
unchanging
routine
testify
to
our
sense
of
how
hard
it
is
to
step
twice
in
the
heraclitan
river
there
is
no
one
self
always
at
work
and
therefore
it
is
of
great
importance
in
the
formation
of
any
public
opinion
what
self
is
engaged
the
japanese
ask
the
right
to
settle
in
california
clearly
it
makes
a
whole
lot
of
difference
whether
you
conceive
the
demand
as
a
desire
to
grow
fruit
or
to
marry
the
white
man
daughter
if
two
nations
are
disputing
a
piece
of
territory
it
matters
greatly
whether
the
people
regard
the
negotiations
as
a
real
estate
deal
an
attempt
to
humiliate
them
or
in
the
excited
and
provocative
language
which
usually
enclouds
these
arguments
as
a
rape
for
the
self
which
takes
charge
of
the
instincts
when
we
are
thinking
about
lemons
or
distant
acres
is
very
different
from
the
self
which
appears
when
we
are
thinking
even
potentially
as
the
outraged
head
of
a
family
in
one
case
the
private
feeling
which
enters
into
the
opinion
is
tepid
in
the
other
red
hot
and
so
while
it
is
so
true
as
to
be
mere
tautology
that
determines
opinion
the
statement
is
not
illuminating
until
we
know
which
self
out
of
many
selects
and
directs
the
interest
so
conceived
religious
teaching
and
popular
wisdom
have
always
distinguished
several
personalities
in
each
human
being
they
have
been
called
the
higher
and
lower
the
spiritual
and
the
material
the
divine
and
the
carnal
and
although
we
may
not
wholly
accept
this
classification
we
can
not
fail
to
observe
that
distinctions
exist
instead
of
two
antithetic
selves
a
modern
man
would
probably
note
a
good
many
not
so
sharply
separated
he
would
say
that
the
distinction
drawn
by
theologians
was
arbitrary
and
external
because
many
different
selves
were
grouped
together
as
higher
provided
they
fitted
into
the
theologian
categories
but
he
would
recognize
nevertheless
that
here
was
an
authentic
clue
to
the
variety
of
human
nature
we
have
learned
to
note
many
selves
and
to
be
a
little
less
ready
to
issue
judgment
upon
them
we
understand
that
we
see
the
same
body
but
often
a
different
man
depending
on
whether
he
is
dealing
with
a
social
equal
a
social
inferior
or
a
social
superior
on
whether
he
is
making
love
to
a
woman
he
is
eligible
to
marry
or
to
one
whom
he
is
not
on
whether
he
is
courting

controlled
in

though
you
choke
with
rage
you
must
not

you
would
not
wish
to
display
a
personality
that
exudes
murderous
hate
you
frown
upon
it
and
the
people
around
you
also
frown
but
if
a
war
breaks
out
the
chances
are
that
everybody
you
admire
will
begin
to
feel
the
justification
of
killing
and
hating
at
first
the
vent
for
these
feelings
is
very
narrow
the
selves
which
come
to
the
front
are
those
which
are
attuned
to
a
real
love
of
country
the
kind
of
feeling
that
you

in

wilson
address
to
congress
on

the
reality
of
war
is
still
abhorred
and
what
war
actually
means
is
learned
but
gradually
for
previous
wars
are
only
transfigured
memories
in
that
honeymoon
phase
the
realists
of
war
rightly
insist
that
the
nation
is
not
yet
awake
and
reassure
each
other
by
saying
wait
for
the
casualty
lists
gradually
the
impulse
to
kill
becomes
the
main
business
and
all
those
characters
which
might
modify
it
disintegrate
the
impulse
becomes
central
is
sanctified
and
gradually
turns
unmanageable
it
seeks
a
vent
not
alone
on
the
idea
of
the
enemy
which
is
all
the
enemy
most
people
actually
see
during
the
war
but
upon
all
the
persons
and
objects
and
ideas
that
have
always
been
hateful
hatred
of
the
enemy
is
legitimate
these
other
hatreds
have
themselves
legitimized
by
the
crudest
analogy
and
by
what
once
having
cooled
off
we
recognize
as
the
most
analogy
it
takes
a
long
time
to
subdue
so
powerful
an
impulse
once
it
goes
loose
and
therefore
when
the
war
is
over
in
fact
it
takes
time
and
struggle
to
regain
and
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
peace
in
civilian
character
modern
war
as
herbert
croly
has
said
is
inherent
in
the
political
structure
of
modern
society
but
outlawed
by
its
ideals
for
the
civilian
population
there
exists
no
ideal
code
of
conduct
in
war
such
as
the
soldier
still
possesses
and
chivalry
once
prescribed
the
civilians
are
without
standards
except
those
that
the
best
of
them
manage
to
improvise
the
only
standards
they
possess
make
war
an
accursed
thing
yet
though
the
war
may
be
a
necessary
one
no
moral
training
has
prepared
them
for
it
only
their
higher
selves
have
a
code
and
patterns
and
when
they
have
to
act
in
what
the
higher
regards
as
a
lower
character
profound
disturbance
results
the
preparation
of
characters
for
all
the
situations
in
which
men
may
find
themselves
is
one
function
of
a
moral
education
clearly
then
it
depends
for
its
success
upon
the
sincerity
and
knowledge
with
which
the
environment
has
been
explored
for
in
a
world
falsely
conceived
our
own
characters
are
falsely
conceived
and
we
misbehave
so
the
moralist
must
choose
either
he
must
offer
a
pattern
of
conduct
for
every
phase
of
life
however
distasteful
some
of
its
phases
may
be
or
he
must
guarantee
that
his
pupils
will
never
be
confronted
by
the
situations
he
disapproves
either
he
must
abolish
war
or
teach
people
how
to
wage
it
with
the
greatest
psychic
economy
either
he
must
abolish
the
economic
life
of
man
and
feed
him
with
stardust
and
dew
or
he
must
investigate
all
the
perplexities
of
economic
life
and
offer
patterns
of
conduct
which
are
applicable
in
a
world
where
no
man
is
but
that
is
just
what
the
prevailing
moral
culture
so
generally
refuses
to
do
in
its
best
aspects
it
is
diffident
at
the
awful
complication
of
the
modern
world
in
its
worst
it
is
just
cowardly
now
whether
the
moralists
study
economics
and
politics
and
psychology
or
whether
the
social
scientists
educate
the
moralists
is
no
great
matter
each
generation
will
go
unprepared
into
the
modern
world
unless
it
has
been
taught
to
conceive
the
kind
of
personality
it
will
have
to
be
among
the
issues
it
will
most
likely
meet
most
of
this
the
naive
view
of
leaves
out
of
account
it
forgets
that
self
and
interest
are
both
conceived
somehow
and
that
for
the
most
part
they
are
conventionally
conceived
the
ordinary
doctrine
of
usually
omits
altogether
the
cognitive
function
so
insistent
is
it
on
the
fact
that
human
beings
finally
refer
all
things
to
themselves
that
it
does
not
stop
to
notice
that
men
ideas
of
all
things
and
of
themselves
are
not
instinctive
they
are
acquired
thus
it
may
be
true
enough
as
james
madison
wrote
in
the
tenth
paper
of
the
federalist
that
a
landed
interest
a
manufacturing
interest
a
mercantile
interest
a
moneyed
interest
with
many
lesser
interests
grow
up
of
necessity
in
civilized
nations
and
divide
them
into
different
classes
actuated
by
different
sentiments
and
views
but
if
you
examine
the
context
of
madison
paper
you
discover
something
which
i
think
throws
light
upon
that
view
of
instinctive
fatalism
called
sometimes
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
madison
was
arguing
for
the
federal
constitution
and
among
the
numerous
advantages
of
the
union
he
set
forth
its
tendency
to
break
and
control
the
violence
of
faction
faction
was
what
worried
madison
and
the
causes
of
faction
he
traced
to
the
nature
of
man
where
latent
dispositions
are
brought
into
different
degrees
of
activity
according
to
the
different
circumstances
of
civil
society
a
zeal
for
different
opinions
concerning
religion
concerning
government
and
many
other
points
as
well
of
speculation
as
of
practice
an
attachment
to
different
leaders
ambitiously
contending
for
preeminence
and
power
or
to
persons
of
other
descriptions
whose
fortunes
have
been
interesting
to
the
human
passions
have
in
turn
divided
mankind
into
parties
inflamed
them
with
mutual
animosity
and
rendered
them
much
more
disposed
to
vex
and
oppress
each
other
than
to
coöperate
for
their
common
good
so
strong
is
this
propensity
of
mankind
to
fall
into
mutual
animosities
that
where
no
substantial
occasion
presents
itself
the
most
frivolous
and
fanciful
distinctions
have
been
sufficient
to
kindle
their
unfriendly
passions
and
excite
their
most
violent
conflicts
but
the
and
source
of
factions
has
been
the
various
and
unequal
distribution
of
property
madison
theory
therefore
is
that
the
propensity
to
faction
may
be
kindled
by
religious
or
political
opinions
by
leaders
but
most
commonly
by
the
distribution
of
property
yet
note
that
madison
claims
only
that
men
are
divided
by
their
relation
to
property
he
does
not
say
that
their
property
and
their
opinions
are
cause
and
effect
but
that
differences
of
property
are
the
causes
of
differences
of
opinion
the
pivotal
word
in
madison
argument
is
different
from
the
existence
of
differing
economic
situations
you
can
tentatively
infer
a
probable
difference
of
opinions
but
you
can
not
infer
what
those
opinions
will
necessarily
be
this
reservation
cuts
radically
into
the
claims
of
the
theory
as
that
theory
is
usually
held
that
the
reservation
is
necessary
the
enormous
contradiction
between
dogma
and
practice
among
orthodox
socialists
bears
witness
they
argue
that
the
next
stage
in
social
evolution
is
the
inevitable
result
of
the
present
stage
but
in
order
to
produce
that
inevitable
next
stage
they
organize
and
agitate
to
produce
class
consciousness
why
one
asks
does
not
the
economic
situation
produce
consciousness
of
class
in
everybody
it
just
does
that
is
all
and
therefore
the
proud
claim
will
not
stand
that
the
socialist
philosophy
rests
on
prophetic
insight
into
destiny
it
rests
on
an
hypothesis
about
human
nature

resist

that

since

there
is

theory
have
the
validity
which
is
so
often
claimed
for
it
it
would
enable
us
to
prophesy
we
could
analyze
the
economic
interests
of
a
people
and
deduce
what
the
people
was
bound
to
do
marx
tried
that
and
after
a
good
guess
about
the
trusts
went
wholly
wrong
the
first
socialist
experiment
came
not
as
he
predicted
out
of
the
culmination
of
capitalist
development
in
the
west
but
out
of
the
collapse
of
a
system
in
the
east
why
did
he
go
wrong
why
did
his
greatest
disciple
lenin
go
wrong
because
the
marxians
thought
that
men
economic
position
would
irresistibly
produce
a
clear
conception
of
their
economic
interests
they
thought
they
themselves
possessed
that
clear
conception
and
that
what
they
knew
the
rest
of
mankind
would
learn
the
event
has
shown
not
only
that
a
clear
conception
of
interest
does
not
arise
automatically
in
everyone
but
that
it
did
not
arise
even
in
marx
and
lenin
themselves
after
all
that
marx
and
lenin
have
written
the
social
behavior
of
mankind
is
still
obscure
it
ought
not
to
be
if
economic
position
alone
determined
public
opinion
position
ought
if
their
theory
were
correct
not
only
to
divide
mankind
into
classes
but
to
supply
each
class
with
a
view
of
its
interest
and
a
coherent
policy
for
obtaining
it
yet
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
all
classes
of
men
are
in
constant
perplexity
as
to
what
their
interests
are
footnote
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
it
came
to
the
test
lenin
completely
abandoned
the
materialistic
interpretation
of
politics
had
he
held
sincerely
to
the
marxian
formula
when
he
seized
power
in
he
would
have
said
to
himself
according
to
the
teachings
of
marx
socialism
will
develop
out
of
a
mature
capitalism
here
am
i
in
control
of
a
nation
that
is
only
entering
upon
a
capitalist
development
it
is
true
that
i
am
a
socialist
but
i
am
a
scientific
socialist
it
follows
that
for
the
present
all
idea
of
a
socialist
republic
is
out
of
the
question
we
must
advance
capitalism
in
order
that
the
evolution
which
marx
predicted
may
take
place
but
lenin
did
nothing
of
the
sort
instead
of
waiting
for
evolution
to
evolve
he
tried
by
will
force
and
education
to
defy
the
historical
process
which
his
philosophy
assumed
since
this
was
written
lenin
has
abandoned
communism
on
the
ground
that
russia
does
not
possess
the
necessary
basis
in
a
mature
capitalism
he
now
says
that
russia
must
create
capitalism
which
will
create
a
proletariat
which
will
some
day
create
communism
this
is
at
least
consistent
with
marxist
dogma
but
it
shows
how
little
determinism
there
is
in
the
opinions
of
a
determinist
this
dissolves
the
impact
of
economic
determinism
for
if
our
economic
interests
are
made
up
of
our
variable
concepts
of
those
interests
then
as
the
master
key
to
social
processes
the
theory
fails
that
theory
assumes
that
men
are
capable
of
adopting
only
one
version
of
their
interest
and
that
having
adopted
it
they
move
fatally
to
realize
it
it
assumes
the
existence
of
a
specific
class
interest
that
assumption
is
false
a
class
interest
can
be
conceived
largely
or
narrowly
selfishly
or
unselfishly
in
the
light
of
no
facts
some
facts
many
facts
truth
and
error
and
so
collapses
the
marxian
remedy
for
class
conflicts
that
remedy
assumes
that
if
all
property
could
be
held
in
common
class
differences
would
disappear
the
assumption
is
false
property
might
well
be
held
in
common
and
yet
not
be
conceived
as
a
whole
the
moment
any
group
of
people
failed
to
see
communism
in
a
communist
manner
they
would
divide
into
classes
on
the
basis
of
what
they
saw
in
respect
to
the
existing
social
order
marxian
socialism
emphasizes
property
conflict
as
the
maker
of
opinion
in
respect
to
the
loosely
defined
working
class
it
ignores
property
conflict
as
the
basis
of
agitation
in
respect
to
the
future
it
imagines
a
society
without
property
conflict
and
therefore
without
conflict
of
opinion
now
in
the
existing
social
order
there
may
be
more
instances
where
one
man
must
lose
if
another
is
to
gain
than
there
would
be
under
socialism
but
for
every
case
where
one
must
lose
for
another
to
gain
there
are
endless
cases
where
men
simply
imagine
the
conflict
because
they
are
uneducated
and
under
socialism
though
you
removed
every
instance
of
absolute
conflict
the
partial
access
of
each
man
to
the
whole
range
of
facts
would
nevertheless
create
conflict
a
socialist
state
will
not
be
able
to
dispense
with
education
morality
or
liberal
science
though
on
strict
materialistic
grounds
the
communal
ownership
of
properties
ought
to
make
them
superfluous
the
communists
in
russia
would
not
propagate
their
faith
with
such
unflagging
zeal
if
economic
determinism
were
alone
determining
the
opinion
of
the
russian
people
the
socialist
theory
of
human
nature
is
like
the
hedonistic
calculus
an
example
of
false
determinism
both
assume
that
the
unlearned
dispositions
fatally
but
intelligently
produce
a
certain
type
of
behavior
the
socialist
believes
that
the
dispositions
pursue
the
economic
interest
of
a
class
the
hedonist
believes
that
they
pursue
pleasure
and
avoid
pain
both
theories
rest
on
a
naive
view
of
instinct
a
view
defined
by
james
footnote
of
vol
ii
p
though
radically
qualified
by
him
as
the
faculty
of
acting
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
certain
ends
without
foresight
of
the
ends
and
without
previous
education
in
the
performance
it
is
doubtful
whether
instinctive
action
of
this
sort
figures
at
all
in
the
social
life
of
mankind
for
as
james
pointed
out
footnote
vol
ii
p
every
instinctive
act
in
an
animal
with
memory
must
cease
to
be
after
being
once
repeated
whatever
the
equipment
at
birth
the
innate
dispositions
are
from
earliest
infancy
immersed
in
experience
which
determines
what
shall
excite
them
as
stimulus
they
become
capable
as
mcdougall
says
footnote
introduction
to
fourth
edition
pp
of
being
initiated
not
only
by
the
perception
of
objects
of
the
kind
which
directly
excite
the
innate
disposition
the
natural
or
native
excitants
of
the

most
definitions
of

take
account
only

it
is
only
the
central
part
of
the
disposition
footnote
p
says
mcdougall
further
that
retains
its
specific
character
and
remains
common
to
all
individuals
and
all
situations
in
which
the
instinct
is
excited
the
cognitive
processes
and
the
actual
bodily
movements
by
which
the
instinct
achieves
its
end
may
be
indefinitely
complicated
in
other
words
man
has
an
instinct
of
fear
but
what
he
will
fear
and
how
he
will
try
to
escape
is
determined
not
from
birth
but
by
experience
if
it
were
not
for
this
variability
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
the
inordinate
variety
of
human
nature
but
when
you
consider
that
all
the
important
tendencies
of
the
creature
his
appetites
his
loves
his
hates
his
curiosity
his
sexual
cravings
his
fears
and
pugnacity
are
freely
attachable
to
all
sorts
of
objects
as
stimulus
and
to
all
kinds
of
objects
as
gratification
the
complexity
of
human
nature
is
not
so
inconceivable
and
when
you
think
that
each
new
generation
is
the
casual
victim
of
the
way
a
previous
generation
was
conditioned
as
well
as
the
inheritor
of
the
environment
that
resulted
the
possible
combinations
and
permutations
are
enormous
there
is
no
prima
facie
case
then
for
supposing
that
because
persons
crave
some
particular
thing
or
behave
in
some
particular
way
human
nature
is
fatally
constituted
to
crave
that
and
act
thus
the
craving
and
the
action
are
both
learned
and
in
another
generation
might
be
learned
differently
analytic
psychology
and
social
history
unite
in
supporting
this
conclusion
psychology
indicates
how
essentially
casual
is
the
nexus
between
the
particular
stimulus
and
the
particular
response
anthropology
in
the
widest
sense
reinforces
the
view
by
demonstrating
that
the
things
which
have
excited
men
passions
and
the
means
which
they
have
used
to
realize
them
differ
endlessly
from
age
to
age
and
from
place
to
place
men
pursue
their
interest
but
how
they
shall
pursue
it
is
not
fatally
determined
and
therefore
within
whatever
limits
of
time
this
planet
will
continue
to
support
human
life
man
can
set
no
term
upon
the
creative
energies
of
men

can
issue
no
doom
of
automatism
he
can
say
if
he
must
that
for
his
life
there
will
be
no
changes
which
he
can
recognize
as
good
but
in
saying
that
he
will
be
confining
his
life
to
what
he
can
see
with
his
eye
rejecting
what
he
might
see
with
his
mind
he
will
be

as
the
measure
of
good

which
is
only
the
one
he
happens

speaking
at

had
assured
the

without

sign
of
hesitancy
what
were
the
motives
of
americans
in
footnote
york
may
as
he
described
them
they
were
not
the
motives
which
president
wilson
had
insisted
upon
when
enunciated
the
american
mind
now
of
course
neither
harvey
nor
wilson
nor
the
critics
and
friends
of
either
nor
any
one
else
can
know
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
what
went
on
in
thirty
or
forty
million
adult
minds
but
what
everybody
knows
is
that
a
war
was
fought
and
won
by
a
multitude
of
efforts
stimulated
no
one
knows
in
what
proportion
by
the
motives
of
wilson
and
the
motives
of
harvey
and
all
kinds
of
hybrids
of
the
two
people
enlisted
and
fought
worked
paid
taxes
sacrificed
to
a
common
end
and
yet
no
one
can
begin
to
say
exactly
what
moved
each
person
to
do
each
thing
that
he
did
it
is
no
use
then
harvey
telling
a
soldier
who
thought
this
was
a
war
to
end
war
that
the
soldier
did
not
think
any
such
thing
the
soldier
who
thought
that
and
harvey
who
thought
something
else
thought
in
the
same
speech
harvey
formulated
with
equal
clarity
what
the
voters
of
had
in
their
minds
that
is
a
rash
thing
to
do
and
if
you
simply
assume
that
all
who
voted
your
ticket
voted
as
you
did
then
it
is
a
disingenuous
thing
to
do
the
count
shows
that
sixteen
millions
voted
republican
and
nine
millions
democratic
they
voted
says
harvey
for
and
against
the
league
of
nations
and
in
support
of
this
claim
he
can
point
to
wilson
request
for
a
referendum
and
to
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
democratic
party
and
cox
insisted
that
the
league
was
the
issue
but
then
saying
that
the
league
was
the
issue
did
not
make
the
league
the
issue
and
by
counting
the
votes
on
election
day
you
do
not
know
the
real
division
of
opinion
about
the
league
there
were
for
example
nine
million
democrats
are
you
entitled
to
believe
that
all
of
them
are
staunch
supporters
of
the
league
certainly
you
are
not
for
your
knowledge
of
american
politics
tells
you
that
many
of
the
millions
voted
as
they
always
do
to
maintain
the
existing
social
system
in
the
south
and
that
whatever
their
views
on
the
league
they
did
not
vote
to
express
their
views
those
who
wanted
the
league
were
no
doubt
pleased
that
the
democratic
party
wanted
it
too
those
who
disliked
the
league
may
have
held
their
noses
as
they
voted
but
both
groups
of
southerners
voted
the
same
ticket
were
the
republicans
more
unanimous
anybody
can
pick
republican
voters
enough
out
of
his
circle
of
friends
to
cover
the
whole
gamut
of
opinion
from
the
irreconcilability
of
senators
johnson
and
knox
to
the
advocacy
of
secretary
hoover
and
chief
justice
taft
no
one
can
say
definitely
how
many
people
felt
in
any
particular
way
about
the
league
nor
how
many
people
let
their
feelings
on
that
subject
determine
their
vote
when
there
are
only
two
ways
of
expressing
a
hundred
varieties
of
feeling
there
is
no
certain
way
of
knowing
what
the
decisive
combination
was
senator
borah
found
in
the
republican
ticket
a
reason
for
voting
republican
but
so
did
president
lowell
the
republican
majority
was
composed
of
men
and
women
who
thought
a
republican
victory
would
kill
the
league
plus
those
who
thought
it
the
most
practical
way
to
secure
the
league
plus
those
who
thought
it
the
surest
way
offered
to
obtain
an
amended
league
all
these
voters
were
inextricably
entangled
with
their
own
desire
or
the
desire
of
other
voters
to
improve
business
or
put
labor
in
its
place
or
to
punish
the
democrats
for
going
to
war
or
to
punish
them
for
not
having
gone
sooner
or
to
get
rid
of
burleson
or
to
improve
the
price
of
wheat
or
to
lower
taxes
or
to
stop
daniels
from
outbuilding
the
world
or
to
help
harding
do
the
same
thing
and
yet
a
sort
of
decision
emerged
harding
moved
into
the
white
house
for
the
least
common
denominator
of
all
the
votes
was
that
the
democrats
should
go
and
the
republicans
come
in
that
was
the
only
factor
remaining
after
all
the
contradictions
had
cancelled
each
other
out
but
that
factor
was
enough
to
alter
policy
for
four
years
the
precise
reasons
why
change
was
desired
on
that
november
day
in
are
not
recorded
not
even
in
the
memories
of
the
individual
voters
the
reasons
are
not
fixed
they
grow
and
change
and
melt
into
other
reasons
so
that
the
public
opinions
harding
has
to
deal
with
are
not
the
opinions
that
elected
him
that
there
is
no
inevitable
connection
between
an
assortment
of
opinions
and
a
particular
line
of
action
everyone
saw
in
elected
apparently
on
the
cry
that
he
kept
us
out
of
war
wilson
within
five
months
led
the
country
into
war
the
working
of
the
popular
will
therefore
has
always
called
for
explanation
those
who
have
been
most
impressed
by
its
erratic
working
have
found
a
prophet
in
lebon
and
have
welcomed
generalizations
about
what
sir
robert
peel
called
that
great
compound
of
folly
weakness
prejudice
wrong
feeling
right
feeling
obstinacy
and
newspaper
paragraphs
which
is
called
public
opinion
others
have
concluded
that
since
out
of
drift
and
incoherence
settled
aims
do
appear
there
must
be
a
mysterious
contrivance
at
work
somewhere
over
and
above
the
inhabitants
of
a
nation
they
invoke
a
collective
soul
a
national
mind
a
spirit
of
the
age
which
imposes
order
upon
random
opinion
an
oversoul
seems
to
be
needed
for
the
emotions
and
ideas
in
the
members
of
a
group

not
disclose
anything
so
simple
and
so
crystalline
as
the
formula
which
those
same
individuals
will
accept
as
a
true
statement
of
their
public
opinion
but
the
facts
can
i
think
be
explained
more
convincingly
without
the
help
of
the
oversoul
in
any
of
its
disguises
after
all
the
art
of
inducing
all
sorts
of
people
who
think
differently
to
vote
alike
is
practiced
in
every
political
campaign
in
for
example
the
republican
candidate
had
to
produce
republican
votes
out
of
many
different
kinds
of
republicans
let
us
look
at
hughes
first
speech
after
accepting
the
nomination
footnote
delivered
at
carnegie
hall
new
york
city
july
the
context
is
still
clear
enough
in
our
minds
to
obviate
much
explanation
yet
the
issues
are
no
longer
contentious
the
candidate
was
a
man
of
unusually
plain
speech
who
had
been
out
of
politics
for
several
years
and
was
not
personally
committed
on
the
issues
of
the
recent
past
he
had
moreover
none
of
that
wizardry
which
popular
leaders
like
roosevelt
wilson
or
lloyd
george
possess
none
of
that
histrionic
gift
by
which
such
men
impersonate
the
feelings
of
their
followers
from
that
aspect
of
politics
he
was
by
temperament
and
by
training
remote
but
yet
he
knew
by
calculation
what
the
politician
technic
is
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
know
just
how
to
do
a
thing
but
who
can
not
quite
do
it
themselves
they
are
often
better
teachers
than
the
virtuoso
to
whom
the
art
is
so
much
second
nature
that
he
himself
does
not
know
how
he
does
it
the
statement
that
those
who
can
do
those
who
can
not
teach
is
not
nearly
so
much
of
a
reflection
on
the
teacher
as
it
sounds
hughes
knew
the
occasion
was
momentous
and
he
had
prepared
his
manuscript
carefully
in
a
box
sat
theodore
roosevelt
just
back
from
missouri
all
over
the
house
sat
the
veterans
of
armageddon
in
various
stages
of
doubt
and
dismay
on
the
platform
and
in
the
other
boxes
the
sepulchres
and
men
of
were
to
be
seen
obviously
in
the
best
of
health
and
in
a
melting
mood
out
beyond
the
hall
there
were
powerful
and
powerful
a
war
party
in
the
east
and
in
the
big
cities
a
peace
party
in
the
middle
and
far
west
there
was
strong
feeling
about
mexico
hughes
had
to
form
a
majority
against
the
democrats
out
of
people
divided
into
all
sorts
of
combinations
on
taft
roosevelt
war
neutrality
mexican
intervention
about
the
morality
or
the
wisdom
of
the
affair
we
are
of
course
not
concerned
here
our
only
interest
is
in
the
method
by
which
a
leader
of
heterogeneous
opinion
goes
about
the
business
of
securing
a
homogeneous
vote
this
gathering
is
a
happy
augury
it
means
the
strength
of
it
means
that
the
party
of
is
restored
the
italicized
words
are
binders
in
such
a
speech
has
of
course
no
relation
to
abraham
lincoln
it
is
merely
a
stereotype
by
which
the
piety
which
surrounds
that
name
can
be
transferred
to
the
republican
candidate
who
now
stands
in
his
shoes
lincoln
reminds
the
republicans
bull
moose
and
old
guard
that
before
the
schism
they
had
a
common
history
about
the
schism
no
one
can
afford
to
speak
but
it
is
there
as
yet
unhealed
the
speaker
must
heal
it
now
the
schism
of
had
arisen
over
domestic
questions
the
reunion
of
was
as
roosevelt
had
declared
to
be
based
on
a
common
indignation
against
conduct
of
international
affairs
but
international
affairs
were
also
a
dangerous
source
of
conflict
it
was
necessary
to
find
an
opening
subject
which
would
not
only
ignore
but
would
avoid
also
the
explosive
conflicts
of
the
speaker
skilfully
selected
the
spoils
system
in
diplomatic
appointments
deserving
democrats
was
a
discrediting
phrase
and
hughes
at
once
evokes
it
the
record
being
indefensible
there
is
no
hesitation
in
the
vigor
of
the
attack
logically
it
was
an
ideal
introduction
to
a
common
mood
hughes
then
turns
to
mexico
beginning
with
an
historical
review
he
had
to
consider
the
general
sentiment
that
affairs
were
going
badly
in
mexico
also
a
no
less
general
sentiment
that
war
should
be
avoided
and
two
powerful
currents
of
opinion
one
of
which
said
president
wilson
was
right
in
not
recognizing
huerta
the
other
which
preferred
huerta
to
carranza
and
intervention
to
both
huerta
was
the
first
sore
spot
in
the
record
he
was
certainly
in
fact
the
head
of
the
government
in
mexico
but
the
moralists
who
regarded
huerta
as
a
drunken
murderer
had
to
be
placated
whether
or
not
he
should
be
recognized
was
a
question
to
be
determined
in
the
exercise
of
a
sound
discretion
but
according
to
correct
principles
so
instead
of
saying
that
huerta
should
have
been
recognized
the
candidate
says
that
correct
principles
ought
to
be
applied
everybody
believes
in
correct
principles
and
everybody
of
course
believes
he
possesses
them
to
blur
the
issue
still
further
president
policy
is
described
as
intervention
it
was
that
in
law
perhaps
but
not
in
the
sense
then
currently
meant
by
the
word
by
stretching
the
word
to
cover
what
wilson
had
done
as
well
as
what
the
real
interventionists
wanted
the
issue
between
the
two
factions
was
to
be
repressed
having
got
by
the
two
explosive
points
and
by
letting
the
words
mean
all
things
to
all
men
the
speech
passes
for
a
while
to
safer
ground
the
candidate
tells
the
story
of
tampico
vera
cruz
villa
santa
ysabel
columbus
and
carrizal
hughes
is
specific
either
because
the
facts
as
known
from
the
newspapers
are
irritating
or
because
the
true
explanation
is
as
for
example
in
regard
to
tampico
too
complicated
no
contrary
passions
could
be
aroused
by
such
a
record
but
at
the
end
the
candidate
had
to
take
a
position
his
audience
expected
it
the
indictment
was
roosevelt
would
hughes
adopt
his
remedy
intervention
the
nation
has
no
policy
of
aggression
toward
mexico
we
have
no
desire
for
any
part
of
her
territory
we
wish
her
to
have
peace
stability
and
prosperity
we
should
be
ready
to
aid
her
in
binding
up
her
wounds
in
relieving
her
from
starvation
and
distress
in
giving
her
in
every
practicable
way
the
benefits
of
our
disinterested
friendship
the
conduct
of
this
administration
has
created
difficulties
which
we
shall
have
to
surmount
shall
have
to
adopt
a
new
policy
a
policy
of
and
consistency
through
which
alone
we
can
promote
an
enduring
the
theme
friendship
is
for
the
the
theme
new
policy
and
firmness
is
for
the
interventionists
on
the
record
the
detail
is
overwhelming
on
the
issue
everything
is
cloudy
concerning
the
european
war
hughes
employed
an
ingenious
formula
i
stand
for
the
unflinching
maintenance
of
american
rights
on
land
and
sea
in
order
to
understand
the
force
of
that
statement
at
the
time
it
was
spoken
we
must
remember
how
each
faction
during
the
period
of
neutrality
believed
that
the
nations
it
opposed
in
europe
were
alone
violating
american
rights
hughes
seemed
to
say
to
the
i
would
have
coerced
germany
but
the
had
been
insisting
that
british
sea
power
was
violating
most
of
our
rights
the
formula
covers
two
diametrically
opposed
purposes
by
the
symbolic
phrase
american
rights
but
there
was
the
lusitania
like
the
schism
it
was
an
invincible
obstacle
to
harmony
i
am
confident
that
there
would
have
been
no
destruction
of
american
lives
by
the
sinking
of
the
lusitania
thus
what
can
not
be
compromised
must
be
obliterated
when
there
is
a
question
on
which
we
can
not
all
hope
to
get
together
let
us
pretend
that
it
does
not
exist
about
the
future
of
american
relations
with
europe
hughes
was
silent
nothing
he
could
say
would
possibly
please
the
two
irreconcilable
factions
for
whose
support
he
was
bidding
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
hughes
did
not
invent
this
technic
and
did
not
employ
it
with
the
utmost
success
but
he
illustrated
how
a
public
opinion
constituted
out
of
divergent
opinions
is
clouded
how
its
meaning
approaches
the
neutral
tint
formed
out
of
the
blending
of
many
colors
where
superficial
harmony
is
the
aim
and
conflict
the
fact
obscurantism
in
a
public
appeal
is
the
usual
result
almost
always
vagueness
at
a
crucial
point
in
public
debate
is
a
symptom
of
but
how
is
it
that
a
vague
idea
so
often
has
the
power
to
unite
deeply
felt
opinions
these
opinions
we
recall
however
deeply
they
may
be
felt
are
not
in
continual
and
pungent
contact
with
the
facts
they
profess
to
treat
on
the
unseen
environment
mexico
the
european
war
our
grip
is
slight
though
our
feeling
may
be
intense
the
original
pictures
and
words
which
aroused
it
have
not
anything
like
the
force
of
the
feeling
itself
the
account
of
what
has
happened
out
of
sight
and
hearing
in
a
place
where
we
have
never
been
has
not
and
never
can
have
except
briefly
as
in
a
dream
or
fantasy
all
the
dimensions
of
reality
but
it
can
arouse
all
and
sometimes
even
more
emotion
than
the
reality
for
the
trigger
can
be
pulled
by
more
than
one
stimulus
the
stimulus
which
originally
pulled
the
trigger
may
have
been
a
series
of
pictures
in
the
mind
aroused
by
printed
or
spoken
words
these
pictures
fade
and
are
hard
to
keep
steady
their
contours
and
their
pulse
fluctuate
gradually
the
process
sets
in
of
knowing
what
you
feel
without
being
entirely
certain
why
you
feel
it
the
fading
pictures
are
displaced
by
other
pictures
and
then
by
names
or
symbols
but
the
emotion
goes
on
capable
now
of
being
aroused
by
the
substituted
images
and
names
even
in
severe
thinking
these
substitutions
take
place
for
if
a
man
is
trying
to
compare
two
complicated
situations
he
soon
finds
exhausting
the
attempt
to
hold
both
fully
in
mind
in
all
their
detail
he
employs
a
shorthand
of
names
and
signs
and
samples
he
has
to
do
this
if
he
is
to
advance
at
all
because
he
can
not
carry
the
whole
baggage
in
every
phrase
through
every
step
he
takes
but
if
he
forgets
that
he
has
substituted
and
simplified
he
soon
lapses
into
verbalism
and
begins
to
talk
about
names
regardless
of
objects
and
then
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
when
the
name
divorced
from
its
first
thing
is
carrying
on
a
misalliance
with
some
other
thing
it
is
more
difficult
still
to
guard
against
changelings
in
casual
politics
for
by
what
is
known
to
psychologists
as
conditioned
response
an
emotion
is
not
attached
merely
to
one
idea
there
are
no
end
of
things
which
can
arouse
the
emotion
and
no
end
of
things
which
can
satisfy
it
this
is
particularly
true
where
the
stimulus
is
only
dimly
and
indirectly
perceived
and
where
the
objective
is
likewise
indirect
for
you
can
associate
an
emotion
say
fear
first
with
something
immediately
dangerous
then
with
the
idea
of
that
thing
then
with
something
similar
to
that
idea
and
so
on
and
on
the
whole
structure
of
human
culture
is
in
one
respect
an
elaboration
of
the
stimuli
and
responses
of
which
the
original
emotional
capacities
remain
a
fairly
fixed
center
no
doubt
the
quality
of
emotion
has
changed
in
the
course
of
history
but
with
nothing
like
the
speed
or
elaboration
that
has
characterized
the
conditioning
of
it
people
differ
widely
in
their
susceptibility
to
ideas
there
are
some
in
whom
the
idea
of
a
starving
child
in
russia
is
practically
as
vivid
as
a
starving
child
within
sight
there
are
others
who
are
almost
incapable
of
being
excited
by
a
distant
idea
there
are
many
gradations
between
and
there
are
people
who
are
insensitive
to
facts
and
aroused
only
by
ideas
but
though
the
emotion
is
aroused
by
the
idea
we
are
unable
to
satisfy
the
emotion
by
acting
ourselves
upon
the
scene
itself
the
idea
of
the
starving
russian
child
evokes
a
desire
to
feed
the
child
but
the
person
so
aroused
can
not
feed
it
he
can
only
give
money
to
an
impersonal
organization
or
to
a
personification
which
he
calls
hoover
his
money
does
not
reach
that
child
it
goes
to
a
general
pool
from
which
a
mass
of
children
are
fed
and
so
just
as
the
idea
is
second
hand
so
are
the
effects
of
the
action
second
hand
the
cognition
is
indirect
the
conation
is
indirect
only
the
effect
is
immediate
of
the
three
parts
of
the
process
the
stimulus
comes
from
somewhere
out
of
sight
the
response
reaches
somewhere
out
of
sight
only
the
emotion
exists
entirely
within
the
person
of
the
child
hunger
he
has
only
an
idea
of
the
child
relief
he
has
only
an
idea
but
of
his
own
desire
to
help
he
has
a
real
experience
it
is
the
central
fact
of
the
business
the
emotion
within
himself
which
is
first
hand
within
limits
that
vary
the
emotion
is
transferable
both
as
regards
stimulus
and
response
therefore
if
among
a
number
of
people
possessing
various
tendencies
to
respond
you
can
find
a
stimulus
which
will
arouse
the
same
emotion
in
many
of
them
you
can
substitute
it
for
the
original
stimuli
if
for
example
one
man
dislikes
the
league
another
hates
wilson
and
a
third
fears
labor
you
may
be
able
to
unite
them
if
you
can
find
some
symbol
which
is
the
antithesis
of
what
they
all
hate
suppose
that
symbol
is
americanism
the
first
man
may
read
it
as
meaning
the
preservation
of
american
isolation
or
as
he
may
call
it
independence
the
second
as
the
rejection
of
a
politician
who
clashes
with
his
idea
of
what
an
american
president
should
be
the
third
as
a
call
to
resist
revolution
the
symbol
in
itself
signifies
literally
no
one
thing
in
particular
but
it
can
be
associated
with
almost
anything
and
because
of
that
it
can
become
the
common
bond
of
common
feelings
even
though
those
feelings
were
originally
attached
to
disparate
ideas
when
political
parties
or
newspapers
declare
for
americanism
progressivism
law
and
order
justice
humanity
they
hope
to
amalgamate
the
emotion
of
conflicting
factions
which
would
surely
divide
if
instead
of
these
symbols
they
were
invited
to
discuss
a
specific
program
for
when
a
coalition
around
the
symbol
has
been
effected
feeling
flows
toward
conformity
under
the
symbol
rather
than
toward
critical
scrutiny
of
the
measures
it
is
i
think
convenient
and
technically
correct
to
call
multiple
phrases
like
these
symbolic
they
do
not
stand
for
specific
ideas
but
for
a
sort
of
truce
or
junction
between
ideas
they
are
like
a
strategic
railroad
center
where
many
roads
converge
regardless
of
their
ultimate
origin
or
their
ultimate
destination
but
he
who
captures
the
symbols
by
which
public
feeling
is
for
the
moment
contained
controls
by
that
much
the
approaches
of
public
policy
and
as
long
as
a
particular
symbol
has
the
power
of
coalition
ambitious
factions
will
fight
for
possession
think
for
example
of
lincoln
name
or
of
roosevelt
a
leader
or
an
interest
that
can
make
itself
master
of
current
symbols
is
master
of
the
current
situation
there
are
limits
of
course
too
violent
abuse
of
the
actualities
which
groups
of
people
think
the
symbol
represents
or
too
great
resistance
in
the
name
of
that
symbol
to
new
purposes
will
so
to
speak
burst
the
symbol
in
this
manner
during
the
year
the
imposing
symbol
of
holy
russia
and
the
little
father
burst
under
the
impact
of
suffering
and
defeat
the
tremendous
consequences
of
russia
collapse
were
felt
on
all
the
fronts
and
among
all
the
peoples
they
led
directly
to
a
striking
experiment
in
the
crystallization
of
a
common
opinion
out
of
the
varieties
of
opinion
churned
up
by
the
war
the
fourteen
points
were
addressed
to
all
the
governments
allied
enemy
neutral
and
to
all
the
peoples
they
were
an
attempt
to
knit
together
the
chief
imponderables
of
a
world
war
necessarily
this
was
a
new
departure
because
this
was
the
first
great
war
in
which
all
the
deciding
elements
of
mankind
could
be
brought
to
think
about
the
same
ideas
or
at
least
about
the
same
names
for
ideas
simultaneously
without
cable
radio
telegraph
and
daily
press
the
experiment
of
the
fourteen
points
would
have
been
impossible
it
was
an
attempt
to
exploit
the
modern
machinery
of
communication
to
start
the
return
to
a
common
consciousness
throughout
the
world
but
first
we
must
examine
some
of
the
circumstances
as
they
presented
themselves
at
the
end
of
for
in
the
form
which
the
document
finally
assumed
all
these
considerations
are
somehow
represented
during
the
summer
and
autumn
a
series
of
events
had
occurred
which
profoundly
affected
the
temper
of
the
people
and
the
course
of
the
war
in
july
the
russians
had
made
a
last
offensive
had
been
disastrously
beaten
and
the
process
of
demoralization
which
led
to
the
bolshevik
revolution
of
november
had
begun
somewhat
earlier
the
french
had
suffered
a
severe
and
almost
disastrous
defeat
in
champagne
which
produced
mutinies
in
the
army
and
a
defeatist
agitation
among
the
civilians
england
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
the
submarine
raids
from
the
terrible
losses
of
the
flanders
battles
and
in
november
at
cambrai
the
british
armies
met
a
reverse
that
appalled
the
troops
at
the
front
and
the
leaders
at
home
extreme
war
weariness
pervaded
the
whole
of
western
europe
in
effect
the
agony
and
disappointment
had
jarred
loose
concentration
on
the
accepted
version
of
the
war
their
interests
were
no
longer
held
by
the
ordinary
official
pronouncements
and
their
attention
began
to
wander
fixing
now
upon
their
own
suffering
now
upon
their
party
and
class
purposes
now
upon
general
resentments
against
the
governments
that
more
or
less
perfect
organization
of
perception
by
official
propaganda
of
interest
and
attention
by
the
stimuli
of
hope
fear
and
hatred
which
is
called
morale
was
by
way
of
breaking
down
the
minds
of
men
everywhere
began
to
search
for
new
attachments
that
promised
relief
suddenly
they
beheld
a
tremendous
drama
on
the
eastern
front
there
was
a
christmas
truce
an
end
of
slaughter
an
end
of
noise
a
promise
of
peace
at
the
dream
of
all
simple
people
had
come
to
life
it
was
possible
to
negotiate
there
was
some
other
way
to
end
the
ordeal
than
by
matching
lives
with
the
enemy
timidly
but
with
rapt
attention
people
began
to
turn
to
the
east
why
not
they
asked
what
is
it
all
for
do
the
politicians
know
what
they
are
doing
are
we
really
fighting
for
what
they
say
is
it
possible
perhaps
to
secure
it
without
fighting
under
the
ban
of
the
censorship
little
of
this
was
allowed
to
show
itself
in
print
but
when
lord
lansdowne
spoke
there
was
a
response
from
the
heart
the
earlier
symbols
of
the
war
had
become
hackneyed
and
had
lost
their
power
to
unify
beneath
the
surface
a
wide
schism
was
opening
up
in
each
allied
country
something
similar
was
happening
in
central
europe
there
too
the
original
impulse
of
the
war
was
weakened
the
union
sacrée
was
broken
the
vertical
cleavages
along
the
battle
front
were
cut
across
by
horizontal
divisions
running
in
all
kinds
of
unforeseeable
ways
the
moral
crisis
of
the
war
had
arrived
before
the
military
decision
was
in
sight
all
this
president
wilson
and
his
advisers
realized
they
had
not
of
course
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
situation
but
what
i
have
sketched
they
knew
they
knew
also
that
the
allied
governments
were
bound
by
a
series
of
engagements
that
in
letter
and
in
spirit
ran
counter
to
the
popular
conception
of
what
the
war
was
about
the
resolutions
of
the
paris
economic
conference
were
of
course
public
property
and
the
network
of
secret
treaties
had
been
published
by
the
bolsheviks
in
november
of
footnote
president
wilson
stated
at
his
conference
with
the
senators
that
he
had
never
heard
of
these
treaties
until
he
reached
paris
that
statement
is
perplexing
the
fourteen
points
as
the
text
shows
could
not
have
been
formulated
without
a
knowledge
of
the
secret
treaties
the
substance
of
those
treaties
was
before
the
president
when
he
and
colonel
house
prepared
the
final
published
text
of
the
fourteen
points
their
terms
were
only
vaguely
known
to
the
peoples
but
it
was
definitely
believed
that
they
did
not
comport
with
the
idealistic
slogan
of
no
annexations
and
no
indemnities
popular
questioning
took
the
form
of
asking
how
many
thousand
english
lives
or
dalmatia
were
worth
how
many
french
lives
poland
or
mesopotamia
were
worth
nor
was
such
questioning
entirely
unknown
in
america
the
whole
allied
cause
had
been
put
on
the
defensive
by
the
refusal
to
participate
at
here
was
a
highly
sensitive
state
of
mind
which
no
competent
leader
could
fail
to
consider
the
ideal
response
would
have
been
joint
action
by
the
allies
that
was
found
to
be
impossible
when
it
was
considered
at
the
interallied
conference
of
october
but
by
december
the
pressure
had
become
so
great
that
george
and
wilson
were
moved
independently
to
make
some
response
the
form
selected
by
the
president
was
a
statement
of
peace
terms
under
fourteen
heads
the
numbering
of
them
was
an
artifice
to
secure
precision
and
to
create
at
once
the
impression
that
here
was
a
document
the
idea
of
stating
peace
terms
instead
of
war
aims
arose
from
the
necessity
of
establishing
a
genuine
alternative
to
the
negotiations
they
were
intended
to
compete
for
attention
by
substituting
for
the
spectacle
of
parleys
the
much
grander
spectacle
of
a
public
debate
having
enlisted
the
interest
of
the
world
it
was
necessary
to
hold
that
interest
unified
and
flexible
for
all
the
different
possibilities
which
the
situation
contained
the
terms
had
to
be
such
that
the
majority
among
the
allies
would
regard
them
as
worth
while
they
had
to
meet
the
national
aspirations
of
each
people
and
yet
to
limit
those
aspirations
so
that
no
one
nation
would
regard
itself
as
a
catspaw
for
another
the
terms
had
to
satisfy
official
interests
so
as
not
to
provoke
official
disunion
and
yet
they
had
to
meet
popular
conceptions
so
as
to
prevent
the
spread
of
demoralization
they
had
in
short
to
preserve
and
confirm
allied
unity
in
case
the
war
was
to
go
on
but
they
had
also
to
be
the
terms
of
a
possible
peace
so
that
in
case
the
german
center
and
left
were
ripe
for
agitation
they
would
have
a
text
with
which
to
smite
the
governing
class
the
terms
had
therefore
to
push
the
allied
governors
nearer
to
their
people
drive
the
german
governors
away
from
their
people
and
establish
a
line
of
common
understanding
between
the
allies
the
germans
and
the
subject
peoples
of
the
fourteen
points
were
a
daring
attempt
to
raise
a
standard
to
which
almost
everyone
might
repair
if
a
sufficient
number
of
the
enemy
people
were
ready
there
would
be
peace
if
not
then
the
allies
would
be
better
prepared
to
sustain
the
shock
of
war
all
these
considerations
entered
into
the
making
of
the
fourteen
points
no
one
man
may
have
had
them
all
in
mind
but
all
the
men
concerned
had
some
of
them
in
mind
against
this
background
let
us
examine
certain
aspects
of
the
document
the
first
five
points
and
the
fourteenth
deal
with
open
diplomacy
freedom
of
the
seas
equal
trade
opportunities
reduction
of
armaments
no
imperialist
annexation
of
colonies
and
the
league
of
nations
they
might
be
described
as
a
statement
of
the
popular
generalizations
in
which
everyone
at
that
time
professed
to
believe
but
number
three
is
more
specific
it
was
aimed
consciously
and
directly
at
the
resolutions
of
the
paris
economic
conference
and
was
meant
to
relieve
the
german
people
of
their
fear
of
suffocation
number
six
is
the
first
point
dealing
with
a
particular
nation
it
was
intended
as
a
reply
to
russian
suspicion
of
the
allies
and
the
eloquence
of
its
promises
was
attuned
to
the
drama
of
number
seven
deals
with
belgium
and
is
as
unqualified
in
form
and
purpose
as
was
the
conviction
of
practically
the
whole
world
including
very
large
sections
of
central
europe
over
number
eight
we
must
pause
it
begins
with
an
absolute
demand
for
evacuation
and
restoration
of
french
territory
and
then
passes
on
to
the
question
of
the
phrasing
of
this
clause
most
perfectly
illustrates
the
character
of
a
public
statement
which
must
condense
a
vast
complex
of
interests
in
a
few
words
and
the
wrong
done
to
france
by
prussia
in
in
the
matter
of
which
has
unsettled
the
peace
of
the
world
for
nearly
fifty
years
should
be
righted
every
word
here
was
chosen
with
meticulous
care
the
wrong
done
should
be
righted
why
not
say
that
should
be
restored
it
was
not
said
because
it
was
not
certain
that
all
of
the
french
that
would
fight
on
indefinitely
for
reannexation
if
they
were
offered
a
plebiscite
and
because
it
was
even
less
certain
whether
the
english
and
italians
would
fight
on
the
formula
had
therefore
to
cover
both
contingencies
the
word
righted
guaranteed
satisfaction
to
france
but
did
not
read
as
a
commitment
to
simple
annexation
but
why
speak
of
the
wrong
done
by
in
the
word
prussia
was
of
course
intended
to
remind
the
south
germans
that
belonged
not
to
them
but
to
prussia
why
speak
of
peace
unsettled
for
fifty
years
and
why
the
use
of
in
the
first
place
what
the
french
and
the
rest
of
the
world
remembered
was
that
was
the
nodal
point
of
their
grievance
but
the
formulators
of
the
fourteen
points
knew
that
french
officialdom
planned
for
more
than
the
of
the
secret
memoranda
that
had
passed
between
the
ministers
and
french
officials
in
covered
the
annexation
of
the
saar
valley
and
some
sort
of
dismemberment
of
the
rhineland
it
was
planned
to
include
the
saar
valley
under
the
term
because
it
had
been
part
of
in
though
it
had
been
detached
in
and
was
no
part
of
the
territory
at
the
close
of
the
war
the
official
french
formula
for
annexing
the
saar
was
to
subsume
it
under
meaning
the
of
by
insistence
on
the
president
was
really
defining
the
ultimate
boundary
between
germany
and
france
was
adverting
to
the
secret
treaty
and
was
casting
it
aside
number
nine
a
little
less
subtly
does
the
same
thing
in
respect
to
italy
clearly
recognizable
lines
of
nationality
are
exactly
what
the
lines
of
the
treaty
of
london
were
not
those
lines
were
partly
strategic
partly
economic
partly
imperialistic
partly
ethnic
the
only
part
of
them
that
could
possibly
procure
allied
sympathy
was
that
which
would
recover
the
genuine
italia
irredenta
all
the
rest
as
everyone
who
was
informed
knew
merely
delayed
the
impending
jugoslav
revolt
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
apparently
unanimous
enthusiasm
which
greeted
the
fourteen
points
represented
agreement
on
a
program
everyone
seemed
to
find
something
that
he
liked
and
stressed
this
aspect
and
that
detail
but
no
one
risked
a
discussion
the
phrases
so
pregnant
with
the
underlying
conflicts
of
the
civilized
world
were
accepted
they
stood
for
opposing
ideas
but
they
evoked
a
common
emotion
and
to
that
extent
they
played
a
part
in
rallying
the
western
peoples
for
the
desperate
ten
months
of
war
which
they
had
still
to
endure
as
long
as
the
fourteen
points
dealt
with
that
hazy
and
happy
future
when
the
agony
was
to
be
over
the
real
conflicts
of
interpretation
were
not
made
manifest
they
were
plans
for
the
settlement
of
a
wholly
invisible
environment
and
because
these
plans
inspired
all
groups
each
with
its
own
private
hope
all
hopes
ran
together
as
a
public
hope
for
harmonization
as
we
saw
in
hughes
speech
is
a
hierarchy
of
symbols
as
you
ascend
the
hierarchy
in
order
to
include
more
and
more
factions
you
may
for
a
time
preserve
the
emotional
connection
though
you
lose
the
intellectual
but
even
the
emotion
becomes
thinner
as
you
go
further
away
from
experience
you
go
higher
into
generalization
or
subtlety
as
you
go
up
in
the
balloon
you
throw
more
and
more
concrete
objects
overboard
and
when
you
have
reached
the
top
with
some
phrase
like
the
rights
of
humanity
or
the
world
made
safe
for
democracy
you
see
far
and
wide
but
you
see
very
little
yet
the
people
whose
emotions
are
entrained
do
not
remain
passive
as
the
public
appeal
becomes
more
and
more
all
things
to
all
men
as
the
emotion
is
stirred
while
the
meaning
is
dispersed
their
very
private
meanings
are
given
a
universal
application
whatever
you
want
badly
is
the
rights
of
humanity
for
the
phrase
ever
more
vacant
capable
of
meaning
almost
anything
soon
comes
to
mean
pretty
nearly
everything
wilson
phrases
were
understood
in
endlessly
different
ways
in
every
corner
of
the
earth
no
document
negotiated
and
made
of
public
record
existed
to
correct
the
confusion
footnote
the
american
interpretation
of
the
fourteen
points
was
explained
to
the
allied
statesmen
just
before
the
armistice
and
so
when
the
day
of
settlement
came
everybody
expected
everything
the
european
authors
of
the
treaty
had
a
large
choice
and
they
chose
to
realize
those
expectations
which
were
held
by
those
of
their
countrymen
who
wielded
the
most
power
at
home
they
came
down
the
hierarchy
from
the
rights
of
humanity
to
the
rights
of
france
britain
and
italy
they
did
not
abandon
the
use
of
symbols
they
abandoned
only
those
which
after
the
war
had
no
permanent
roots
in
the
imagination
of
their
constituents
they
preserved
the
unity
of
france
by
the
use
of
symbolism
but
they
would
not
risk
anything
for
the
unity
of
europe
the
symbol
france
was
deeply
attached
the
symbol
europe
had
only
a
recent
history
nevertheless
the
distinction
between
an
omnibus
like
europe
and
a
symbol
like
france
is
not
sharp
the
history
of
states
and
empires
reveals
times
when
the
scope
of
the
unifying
idea
increases
and
also
times
when
it
shrinks
one
can
not
say
that
men
have
moved
consistently
from
smaller
loyalties
to
larger
ones
because
the
facts
will
not
bear
out
the
claim
the
roman
empire
and
the
holy
roman
empire
bellied
out
further
than
those
national
unifications
in
the
nineteenth
century
from
which
believers
in
a
world
state
argue
by
analogy
nevertheless
it
is
probably
true
that
the
real
integration
has
increased
regardless
of
the
temporary
inflation
and
deflation
of
empires
such
a
real
integration
has
undoubtedly
occurred
in
american
history
in
the
decade
before
most
men
it
seems
felt
that
their
state
and
their
community
were
real
but
that
the
confederation
of
states
was
unreal
the
idea
of
their
state
its
flag
its
most
conspicuous
leaders
or
whatever
it
was
that
represented
massachusetts
or
virginia
were
genuine
symbols
that
is
to
say
they
were
fed
by
actual
experiences
from
childhood
occupation
residence
and
the
like
the
span
of
men
experience
had
rarely
traversed
the
imaginary
boundaries
of
their
states
the
word
virginian
was
related
to
pretty
nearly
everything
that
most
virginians
had
ever
known
or
felt
it
was
the
most
extensive
political
idea
which
had
genuine
contact
with
their
experience
their
experience
not
their
needs
for
their
needs
arose
out
of
their
real
environment
which
in
those
days
was
at
least
as
large
as
the
thirteen
colonies
they
needed
a
common
defense
they
needed
a
financial
and
economic
regime
as
extensive
as
the
confederation
but
as
long
as
the
of
the
state
encompassed
them
the
state
symbols
exhausted
their
political
interest
an
interstate
idea
like
the
confederation
represented
a
powerless
abstraction
it
was
an
omnibus
rather
than
a
symbol
and
the
harmony
among
divergent
groups
which
the
omnibus
creates
is
transient
i
have
said
that
the
idea
of
confederation
was
a
powerless
abstraction
yet
the
need
of
unity
existed
in
the
decade
before
the
constitution
was
adopted
the
need
existed
in
the
sense
that
affairs
were
askew
unless
the
need
of
unity
was
taken
into
account
gradually
certain
classes
in
each
colony
began
to
break
through
the
state
experience
their
personal
interests
led
across
the
state
lines
to
interstate
experiences
and
gradually
there
was
constructed
in
their
minds
a
picture
of
the
american
environment
which
was
truly
national
in
scope
for
them
the
idea
of
federation
became
a
true
symbol
and
ceased
to
be
an
omnibus
the
most
imaginative
of
these
men
was
alexander
hamilton
it
happened
that
he
had
no

from

thus
to
most
men
of
the
time
the
question
of
whether
the
capital
should
be
in
virginia
or
in
philadelphia
was
of
enormous
importance
because
they
were
locally
minded
to
hamilton
this
question
was
of
no
emotional
consequence
what
he
wanted
was
the
assumption
of
the
state
debts
because
they
would
further
nationalize
the
proposed
union
so
he
gladly
traded
the
site
of
the
capitol
for
two

from
men
who
represented
the
potomac
district

hamilton
the
union
was
a
symbol
that
represented
all
his
interests
and
his
whole
experience
to
white

lee
from
the
potomac
the

of
their
province
was

symbols
are
often
so
useful
and
so
mysteriously
powerful
that
the
word
itself
exhales
a
magical
glamor
in
thinking
about
symbols
it
is
tempting
to
treat
them
as
if
they
possessed
independent
energy

no

of
symbols
which
once
provoked
ecstasy
have
quite
ceased

anybody
the

full
of
dead
emblems
and
incantations

there
is

in
the

that
which
it

by

in
the
human
mind
the
symbols
that
have
lost
their
power
and
the
symbols
incessantly
suggested
which
fail
to

remind
us
that
if
we
were
patient
enough
to
study
in

the

should

otherwise
they

alliance
as
well
as
a
declaration
of
independence
for
all
the
world
plus
a
monroe
doctrine
for
the
planet
since
the
offering
of
symbols
is
so
generous
and
the
meaning
that
can
be
imputed
is
so
elastic
how
does
any
particular
symbol
take
root
in
any
particular
person
mind
it
is
planted
there
by
another
human
being
whom
we
recognize
as
authoritative
if
it
is
planted
deeply
enough
it
may
be
that
later
we
shall
call
the
person
authoritative
who
waves
that
symbol
at
us
but
in
the
first
instance
symbols
are
made
congenial
and
important
because
they
are
introduced
to
us
by
congenial
and
important
people
for
we
are
not
born
out
of
an
egg
at
the
age
of
eighteen
with
a
realistic
imagination
we
are
still
as
shaw
recalls
in
the
era
of
burge
and
lubin
where
in
infancy
we
are
dependent
upon
older
beings
for
our
contacts
and
so
we
make
our
connections
with
the
outer
world
through
certain
beloved
and
authoritative
persons
they
are
the
first
bridge
to
the
invisible
world
and
though
we
may
gradually
master
for
ourselves
many
phases
of
that
larger
environment
there
always
remains
a
vaster
one
that
is
unknown
to
that
we
still
relate
ourselves
through
authorities
where
all
the
facts
are
out
of
sight
a
true
report
and
a
plausible
error
read
alike
sound
alike
feel
alike
except
on
a
few
subjects
where
our
own
knowledge
is
great
we
can
not
choose

true
and
false
accounts

we
choose
between
trustworthy
and
untrustworthy
reporters

the

enough
this

is
sometimes
regarded
as
inherently
undignified
as

complete
independence
in

is
simply
unthinkable
if
we
could
not
take
practically
everything
for

we
should
spend
our
lives
in
utter
triviality
the
nearest
thing
to
a
wholly
independent
adult
is
a
hermit

the
range
of
a
action
is
very
short

entirely
for
himself

can
act
only
within
a
tiny
radius
and
for
simple
ends
if
he
has
time
to
think
great
thoughts
we
can
be
certain
that
he
has
accepted
without

before
he
went
in

a
whole
repertory
of
painfully
acquired
information
about
how

how

also
about
what
the
great
questions
are
on
all

a
very
few
matters
for
short
stretches
in

the
utmost
independence
that
we
can
exercise
is
to
multiply
the
authorities
to
whom
we
give
a
friendly
hearing
as
congenital
amateurs
our
quest
for
truth
consists
in
stirring
up
the
experts
and
forcing
them
to
answer
any
heresy
that
has
the
accent
of
conviction
in
such
a
debate
we
can
often
judge
who
has
won
the
dialectical
victory

we
are
virtually
defenseless
against
a
false
premise
that
none
of

has
challenged
or
a

that
none

never

invariably
regarded
it

perverse
for
there
are
two
visions
of
democracy
one
presupposes
the

the
other
an
oversoul
regulating
everything
of
the
two
the
oversoul
has
some
advantage
because
it
does
at
least
recognize
that
the
mass
makes
decisions
that
are
not
spontaneously
born
in

the
oversoul
as
presiding
genius
in

behavior
is
a
superfluous
mystery

we
fix
our
attention

the
machine
the
machine

quite
prosaic
reality
it

human

who
can

they
perform
all
the
duties
usually
assigned
to
the
oversoul
the
reason
for
the
machine
is
not
the
perversity
of
human
nature
it
is
that
out
of
the
private
notions
of
any
group
no
common
idea
emerges
by
itself

the
number
of
ways
is
limited

which
a
multitude

can

would

carry

after

most
of

the
choice
had
to
be
connected
by
the
transfer
of
interest
through
the
symbols
with
individual
opinion
the
professional
politicians
learned
this
long
before
the
democratic
philosophers
and
so
they
organized
the
caucus
the
nominating
convention
and
the
steering
committee
as
the
means
of
formulating
a
definite
choice
everyone
who
wishes
to
accomplish
anything
that
requires
the
cooperation
of
a
large
number
of
people
follows
their
example
sometimes
it
is
done
rather
brutally
as
when
the
peace
conference
reduced
itself
to
the
council
of
ten
and
the
council
of
ten
to
the
big
three
or
four
and
wrote
a
treaty
which
the
minor
allies
their
own
constituents
and
the
enemy
were
permitted
to
take
or
leave
more
consultation
than
that
is
generally
possible
and
desirable
but
the
essential
fact
remains
that
a
small
number
of
heads
present
a
choice
to
a
large
group
the
abuses
of
the
steering
committee
have
led
to
various
proposals
such
as
the
initiative
referendum
and
direct
primary
but
these
merely
postponed
or
obscured
the
need
for
a
machine
by
complicating
the
elections
or
as
wells
once
said
with
scrupulous
accuracy
the
selections
for
no
amount
of
balloting
can
obviate
the
need
of
creating
an
issue
be
it
a
measure
or
a
candidate
on
which
the
voters
can
say
yes
or
no
there
is
in
fact
no
such
thing
as
direct
legislation
for
what
happens
where
it
is
supposed
to
exist
the
citizen
goes
to
the
polls
receives
a
ballot
on
which
a
number
of
measures
are
printed
almost
always
in
abbreviated
form
and
if
he
says
anything
at
all
he
says
yes
or
no
the
most
brilliant
amendment
in
the
world
may
occur
to
him
he
votes
yes
or
no
on
that
bill
and
no
other
you
have
to
commit
violence
against
the
english
language
to
call
that
legislation
i
do
not
argue
of
course
that
there
are
no
benefits
whatever
you
call
the
process
i
think
that
for
certain
kinds
of
issues
there
are
distinct
benefits
but
the
necessary
simplicity
of
any
mass
decision
is
a
very
important
fact
in
view
of
the
inevitable
complexity
of
the
world
in
which
those
decisions
operate
the
most
complicated
form
of
voting
that
anyone
proposes
is
i

the
preferential
ballot
among
a

says
to

more
indirect

there
is
no

also
that
it

are

that

one
can
say
that
successful

require
a
higher
organization
of

a

may
therefore

result

that
is
as
he
rightly
says
a
chaos
of
individualism
and

the
disintegration
of
a
symbol
like

russia
or
the

is
always
the
beginning
of
a
long
upheaval
these
great
symbols
possess
by
transference
all
the
minute
and

loyalties
of
an
ancient
and

society
they
evoke
the
feeling
that
each

has
for

the
great
symbols
take
up
these
devotions
and
can
arouse
them
without
calling
forth
the
primitive
images
the
lesser
symbols
of
public

the
more
casual

always
referred

the

both
a

to
work
for

just
because
the
few
who
are

placed
must
choose

the

is
also
an

into

are
not
flattering
if

yet
it
is
impossible
to
conclude
that
symbols
are
altogether
instruments

devil
in

realm

contemplation
they
are
undoubtedly

they
may
be
beneficent

are

the
necessity
is
often
imagined
the
peril
manufactured
but
when
quick
results
are
imperative
the
manipulation
of
masses
through
symbols
may
be
the
only
quick
way
of
having
a
critical
thing
done
it
is
often
more
important
to
act
than
to

it

it

does
that
it
obscures

and
obfuscates

it
immobilizes

at

it
enormously

run
the

escapes
from

the

the

the
incidence
of
policy
determines
the
relation
between
leader
and
following
if
those
whom
he
needs
in
his
plan
are
remote
from
the
place
where
the
action
takes
place
if
the
results
are
hidden
or
postponed
if
the
individual
obligations
are
indirect
or
not
yet
due
above
all
if
assent
is
an
exercise
of
some
pleasurable
emotion
the
leader
is
likely
to
have
a
free
hand
those
programs
are
immediately
most
popular
like
prohibition
among
teetotalers
which
do
not
at
once
impinge
upon
the
private
habits
of
the
followers
that
is
one
great
reason
why
governments
have
such
a
free
hand
in
foreign
affairs
most
of
the
frictions
between
two
states
involve
a
series
of
obscure
and
contentions
occasionally
on
the
frontier
but
far
more
often
in
regions
about
which
school
geographies
have
supplied
no
precise
ideas
in
czechoslovakia
america
is
regarded
as
the
liberator
in
american
newspaper
paragraphs
and
musical
comedy
in
american
conversation
by
and
large
it
has
never
been
finally
settled
whether
the
country
we
liberated
is
czechoslavia
or
jugoslovakia
in
foreign
affairs
the
incidence
of
policy
is
for
a
very
long
time
confined
to
an
unseen
environment
nothing
that
happens
out
there
is
felt
to
be
wholly
real
and
so
because
in
the
period
nobody
has
to
fight
and
nobody
has
to
pay
governments
go
along
according
to
their
lights
without
much
reference
to
their
people
in
local
affairs
the
cost
of
a
policy
is
more
easily
visible
and
therefore
all
but
the
most
exceptional
leaders
prefer
policies
in
which
the
costs
are
as
far
as
possible
indirect
they
do
not
like
direct
taxation
they
do
not
like
to
pay
as
they
go
they
like
long
term
debts
they
like
to
have
the
voters
believe
that
the
foreigner
will
pay
they
have
always
been
compelled
to
calculate
prosperity
in
terms
of
the
producer
rather
than
in
terms
of
the
consumer
because
the
incidence
on
the
consumer
is
distributed
over
so
many
trivial
items
labor
leaders
have
always
preferred
an
increase
of
money
wages
to
a
decrease
in
prices
there
has
always
been
more
popular
interest
in
the
profits
of
millionaires
which
are
visible
but
comparatively
unimportant
than
in
the
wastes
of
the
industrial
system
which
are
huge
but
elusive
a
legislature
dealing
with
a
shortage
of
houses
such
as
exists
when
this
is
written
illustrates
this
rule
first
by
doing
nothing
to
increase
the
number
of
houses
second
by
smiting
the
greedy
landlord
on
the
hip
third
by
investigating
the
profiteering
builders
and
working
men
for
a
constructive
policy
deals
with
remote
and
uninteresting
factors
while
a
greedy
landlord
or
a
profiteering
plumber
is
visible
and
immediate
but
while
people
will
readily
believe
that
in
an
unimagined
future
and
in
unseen
places
a
certain
policy
will
benefit
them
the
actual
working
out
of
policy
follows
a
different
logic
from
their
opinions
a
nation
may
be
induced
to
believe
that
jacking
up
the
freight
rates
will
make
the
railroads
prosperous
but
that
belief
will
not
make
the
roads
prosperous
if
the
impact
of
those
rates
on
farmers
and
shippers
is
such
as
to
produce
a
commodity
price
beyond
what
the
consumer
can
pay
whether
the
consumer
will
pay
the
price
depends
not
upon
whether
he
nodded
his
head
nine
months
previously
at
the
proposal
to
raise
rates
and
save
business
but
on
whether
he
now
wants
a
new
hat
or
a
new
automobile
enough
to
pay
for
them
leaders
often
pretend
that
they
have
merely
uncovered
a
program
which
existed
in
the
minds
of
their
public
when
they
believe
it
they
are
usually
deceiving
themselves
programs
do
not
invent
themselves
synchronously
in
a
multitude
of
minds
that
is
not
because
a
multitude
of
minds
is
necessarily
inferior
to
that
of
the
leaders
but
because
thought
is
the
function
of
an
organism
and
a
mass
is
not
an
organism
this
fact
is
obscured
because
the
mass
is
constantly
exposed
to
suggestion
it
reads
not
the
news
but
the
news
with
an
aura
of
suggestion
about
it
indicating
the
line
of
action
to
be
taken
it
hears
reports
not
objective
as
the
facts
are
but
already
stereotyped
to
a
certain
pattern
of
behavior
thus
the
ostensible
leader
often
finds
that
the
real
leader
is
a
powerful
newspaper
proprietor
but
if
as
in
a
laboratory
one
could
remove
all
suggestion
and
leading
from
the
experience
of
a
multitude
one
would
i
think
find
something
like
this
a
mass
exposed
to
the
same
stimuli
would
develop
responses
that
could
theoretically
be
charted
in
a
polygon
of
error
there
would
be
a
certain
group
that
felt
sufficiently
alike
to
be
classified
together
there
would
be
variants
of
feeling
at
both
ends
these
classifications
would
tend
to
harden
as
individuals
in
each
of
the
classifications
made
their
reactions
vocal
that
is
to
say
when
the
vague
feelings
of
those
who
felt
vaguely
had
been
put
into
words
they
would
know
more
definitely
what
they
felt
and
would
then
feel
it
more
definitely
leaders
in
touch
with
popular
feeling
are
quickly
conscious
of
these
reactions
they
know
that
high
prices
are
pressing
upon
the
mass
or
that
certain
classes
of
individuals
are
becoming
unpopular
or
that
feeling
towards
another
nation
is
friendly
or
hostile
but
always
barring
the
effect
of
suggestion
which
is
merely
the
assumption
of
leadership
by
the
reporter
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
feeling
of
the
mass
that
fatally
determined
the
choice
of
any
particular
policy
all
that
the
feeling
of
the
mass
demands
is
that
policy
as
it
is
developed
and
exposed
shall
be
if
not
logically
then
by
analogy
and
association
connected
with
the
original
feeling
so
when
a
new
policy
is
to
be
launched
there
is
a
preliminary
bid
for
community
of
feeling

footnote
excellently
analyzed
in

behavior

crowds
pp
in
the

phase
the
leader
vocalizes
the
prevalent
opinion
of
the
mass
he
identifies
himself
with
the
familiar
attitudes
of
his
audience
sometimes
by
telling
a
good
story
sometimes
by
brandishing
his
patriotism

by

it
will

by
them
where
the

is

all
that
is
essential
is
that
the
program
shall
be
verbally
and
emotionally
connected
at
the
start
with
what
has
become
vocal
in
the

trusted
men
in
a
familiar
role
subscribing
to
the
accepted
symbols
can
go
a
very
long
way
on
their
own
initiative
without
explaining
the
substance
of
their
programs
but
wise
leaders
are
not
content
to
do
that
provided
they
think
publicity
will
not
strengthen
opposition
too
much
and
that
debate
will
not
delay
action
too
long
they
seek
a
certain
measure
of
consent
they
take
if
not
the
whole
mass
then
the
subordinates
of
the
hierarchy
sufficiently
into
their
confidence
to
prepare
them
for
what
might
happen
and
to
make
them
feel
that
they
have
freely
willed
the
result
but
however
sincere
the
leader
may
be
there
is
always
when
the
facts
are
very
complicated
a
certain
amount
of
illusion
in
these
consultations
for
it
is
impossible
that
all
the
contingencies
shall
be
as
vivid
to
the
whole
public
as
they
are
to
the
more
experienced
and
the
more
imaginative
a
fairly
large
percentage
are
bound
to
agree
without
having
taken
the
time
or
without
possessing
the
background
for
appreciating
the
choices
which
the
leader
presents
to
them
no
one
however
can
ask
for
more
and
only
theorists
do
if
we
have
had
our
day
in
court
if
what
we
had
to
say
was
heard
and
then
if
what
is
done
comes
out
well
most
of
us
do
not
stop
to
consider
how
much
our
opinion
affected
the
business
in
hand
and
therefore
if
the
established
powers
are
sensitive
and
if
they
are
visibly
trying
to
meet
popular
feeling
and
actually
removing
some
of
the
causes
of
dissatisfaction
no
matter
how
slowly
they
proceed
provided
they
are
seen
to
be
proceeding
they
have
little
to
fear
it
takes
stupendous
and
persistent
blundering
plus
almost
infinite
tactlessness
to
start
a
revolution
from
below
palace
revolutions
interdepartmental
revolutions
are
a
different
matter
so
too
is
demagogy
that
stops
at
relieving
the
tension
by
expressing
the
feeling
but
the
statesman
knows
that
such
relief
is
temporary
and
if
indulged
too
often
unsanitary
he
therefore
sees
to
it
that
he
arouses
no
feeling
which
he
can
not
sluice
into
a
program
that
deals
with
the
facts
to
which
the
feelings
refer
but
all
leaders
are
not
statesmen
all
leaders
hate
to
resign
and
most
leaders
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
bad
as
things
are
the
other
fellow
would
not
make
them
worse
they
do
not
passively
wait
for
the
public
to
feel
the
incidence
of
policy
because
the
incidence
of
that
discovery
is
generally
upon
their
own
heads
they
are
therefore
intermittently
engaged
in
mending
their
fences
and
consolidating
their
position
the
mending
of
fences
consists
in
offering
an
occasional
scapegoat
in
redressing
a
minor
grievance
affecting
a
powerful
individual
or
faction
rearranging
certain
jobs
placating

stop

study
the
daily
activity
of
any
public
official
who
depends
on

and
you
can
enlarge
this
list
there
are
congressmen
elected
year
after
year
who
never
think
of
dissipating
their
energy
on
public
affairs
they
prefer
to
do
a
little
service
for
a
lot
of
people
on
a
lot
of
little
subjects
rather
than
to
engage
in
trying
to
do
a
big
service
out
there
in
the
void
but
the
number
of
people
to
whom
any
organization
can
be
a
successful
valet
is
limited
and
shrewd
politicians
take
care
to
attend
either
the
influential
or
somebody
so
blatantly
uninfluential
that
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
is
a
mark
of
sensational
magnanimity
the
far
greater
number
who
can
not
be
held
by
favors
the
anonymous
multitude
receive

the
established
leaders
of
any
organization
have
great
natural
advantages
they
are
believed
to
have
better
sources
of
information
the
books
and
papers
are
in
their
offices
they
took
part
in
the
important
conferences
they
met
the
important
people
they
have
responsibility
it
is
therefore
easier
for
them
to
secure
attention
and
to
speak
in
a
convincing
tone
but
also
they
have
a
very
great
deal
of
control
over
the
access
to
the
facts
every
official
is
in
some
degree
a
censor
and
since
no
one
can
suppress
information
either
by
concealing
it
or
forgetting
to
mention
it
without
some
notion
of
what
he
wishes
the
public
to
know
every
leader
is
in
some
degree
a
propagandist
strategically
placed
and
compelled
often
to
choose
even
at
the
best
between
the
equally
cogent
though
conflicting
ideals
of
safety
for
the
institution
and
candor
to
his
public
the
official
finds
himself
deciding
more
and
more
consciously
what
facts
in
what
setting
in
what
guise
he
shall
permit
the
public
to
know
that
the
manufacture
of
consent
is
capable
of
great
refinements
no
one
i
think
denies
the
process
by
which
public
opinions
arise
is
certainly
no
less
intricate
than
it
has
appeared
in
these
pages
and
the
opportunities
for
manipulation
open
to
anyone
who
understands
the
process
are
plain
enough
the
creation
of
consent
is
not
a
new
art
it
is
a
very
old
one
which
was
supposed
to
have
died
out
with
the
appearance
of
democracy
but
it
has
not
died
out
it
has
in
fact
improved
enormously
in
technic
because
it
is
now
based
on
analysis
rather
than
on
rule
of
thumb
and
so
as
a
result
of
psychological
research
coupled
with
the
modern
means
of
communication
the
practice
of
democracy
has
turned
a
corner
a
revolution
is
taking
place
infinitely
more
significant
than
any
shifting
of
economic
power
within
the
life
of
the
generation
now
in
control
of
affairs
persuasion
has
become
a
art
and
a
regular
organ
of
popular
government
none
of
us
begins
to
understand
the
consequences
but
it
is
no
daring
prophecy
to
say
that
the
knowledge
of
how
to
create
consent
will
alter
every
political
calculation
and
modify
every
political
premise
under
the
impact
of
propaganda
not
necessarily
in
the
sinister
meaning
of
the
word
alone
the
old
constants
of
our
thinking
have
become
variables
it
is
no
longer
possible
for
example
to
believe
in
the
original
dogma
of
democracy
that
the
knowledge
needed
for
the
management
of
human
affairs
comes
up
spontaneously
from
the
human
heart
where
we
act
on
that
theory
we
expose
ourselves
to
and
to
forms
of
persuasion
that
we
can
not
verify
it

demonstrated
that
we
can
not

little
the

in
the

taken
for

american
political
writers
have
been

interested
either
in

make

common

in
how
to
prevent
the

will
from
subverting
the
purposes
for
which
they
believe
the
government
exists
according
to
their
traditions
they
have
wished
either
to
tame
opinion

to
obey
it

the
editor
of

series

writes
that

of
the
political
scene
there
is
as
i
shall
try
to
indicate
further
on
the
prospect
of
radical
improvement
by
the
development
of
principles
already
in
operation
but
this
development
will
depend
on
how
well
we
learn
to
use
knowledge
of
the
way
opinions
are
put
together
to
watch
over
our
own
opinions
when
they
are
being
put
together
for
casual
opinion
being
the
product
of
partial
contact
of
tradition
and
personal
interests
can
not
in
the
nature
of
things
take
kindly
to
a
method
of
political
thought
which
is
based
on
exact
record
measurement
analysis
and
comparison
just
those
qualities
of
the
mind
which
determine
what
shall
seem
interesting
important
familiar
personal
and
dramatic
are
the
qualities
which
in
the
first
instance
realistic
opinion
frustrates
therefore
unless
there
is
in
the
community
at
large
a
growing
conviction
that
prejudice
and
intuition
are
not
enough
the
working
out
of
realistic
opinion
which
takes
time
money
labor
conscious
effort
patience
and
equanimity
will
not
find
enough
support
that
conviction
grows
as
increases
and
makes
us
conscious
of
buncombe
contemptuous
of
ourselves
when
we
employ
it
and
on
guard
to
detect
it
without
an
ingrained
habit
of
analyzing
opinion
when
we
read
talk
and
decide
most
of
us
would
hardly
suspect
the
need
of
better
ideas
nor
be
interested
in
them
when
they
appear
nor
be
able
to
prevent
the
new
technic
of
political
intelligence
from
being
manipulated
yet
democracies
if
we
are
to
judge
by
the
oldest
and
most
powerful
of
them
have
made
a
mystery
out
of
public
opinion
there
have
been
skilled
organizers
of
opinion
who
understood
the
mystery
well
enough
to
create
majorities
on
election
day
but
these
organizers
have
been
regarded
by
political
science
as
low
fellows
or
as
problems
not
as
possessors
of
the
most
effective
knowledge
there
was
on
how
to
create
and
operate
public
opinion
the
tendency
of
the
people
who
have
voiced
the
ideas
of
democracy
even
when
they
have
not
managed
its
action
the
tendency
of
students
orators
editors
has
been
to
look
upon
public
opinion
as
men
in
other
societies
looked
upon
the
uncanny
forces
to
which
they
ascribed
the
last
word
in
the
direction
of
events
for
in
almost
every
political
theory
there
is
an
inscrutable
element
which
in
the
heyday
of
that
theory
goes
unexamined
behind
the
appearances
there
is
a
fate
there
are
guardian
spirits
or
mandates
to
a
chosen
people
a
divine
monarchy
a
of
heaven
or
a
class
of
the
better
born
the
more
obvious
angels
demons
and
kings
are
gone
out
of
democratic
thinking
but
the
need
for
believing
that
there
are
reserve
powers
of
guidance
persists
it
persisted
for
those
thinkers
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
designed
the
matrix
of
democracy
they
had
a
pale
god
but
warm
hearts
and
in
the
doctrine
of
popular
sovereignty
they
found
the
answer
to
their
need
of
an
infallible
origin
for
the
new
social
order
there
was
the
mystery
and
only
enemies
of
the
people
touched
it
with
profane
and
curious
hands
they
did
not
remove
the
veil
because
they
were
practical
politicians
in
a
bitter
and
uncertain
struggle
they
had
themselves
felt
the
aspiration
of
democracy
which
is
ever
so
much
deeper
more
intimate
and
more
important
than
any
theory
of
government
they
were
engaged
as
against
the
prejudice
of
ages
in
the
assertion
of
human
dignity
what
possessed
them
was
not
whether
john
smith
had
sound
views
on
any
public
question
but
that
john
smith
scion
of
a
stock
that
had
always
been
considered
inferior
would
now
bend
his
knee
to
no
other
man
it
was
this
spectacle
that
made
it
bliss
in
that
dawn
to
be
alive
but
every
analyst
seems
to
degrade
that
dignity
to
deny
that
all
men
are
reasonable
all
the
time
or
educated
or
informed
to
note
that
people
are
fooled
that
they
do
not
always
know
their
own
interests
and
that
all
men
are
not
equally
fitted
to
govern
the
critics
were
about
as
welcome
as
a
small
boy
with
a
drum
every
one
of
these
observations
on
the
fallibility
of
man
was
being
exploited
ad
nauseam
had
democrats
admitted
there
was
truth
in
any
of
the
aristocratic
arguments
they
would
have
opened
a
breach
in
the
defenses
and
so
just
as
aristotle
had
to
insist
that
the
slave
was
a
slave
by
nature
the
democrats
had
to
insist
that
the
free
man
was
a
legislator
and
administrator
by
nature
they
could
not
stop
to
explain
that
a
human
soul
might
not
yet
have
or
indeed
might
never
have
this
technical
equipment
and
that
nevertheless
it
had
an
inalienable
right
not
to
be
used
as
the
unwilling
instrument
of
other
men
the
superior
people
were
still
too
strong
and
too
unscrupulous
to
have
refrained
from
capitalizing
so
candid
a
statement
so
the
early
democrats
insisted
that
a
reasoned
righteousness
welled
up
spontaneously
out
of
the
mass
of
men
all
of
them
hoped
that
it
would
many
of
them
believed
that
it
did
although
the
cleverest
like
thomas
jefferson
had
all
sorts
of
private
reservations
but
one
thing
was
certain
if
public
opinion
did
not
come
forth
spontaneously
nobody
in
that
age
believed
it
would
come
forth
at
all
for
in
one
fundamental
respect
the
political
science
on
which
democracy
was
based
was
the
same
science
that
aristotle
formulated
it
was
the
same
science
for
democrat
and
aristocrat
royalist
and
republican
in
that
its
major
premise
assumed
the
art
of
government
to
be
a
natural
endowment
men
differed
radically
when
they
tried
to
name
the
men
so
endowed
but
they
agreed
in
thinking
that
the
greatest
question
of
all
was
to
find
those
in
whom
political
wisdom
was
innate
royalists
were
sure
that
kings
were
born
to
govern
alexander
hamilton
thought
that
while
there
are
strong
minds
in
every
walk
of
life
the
representative
body
with
too
few
exceptions
to
have
any
influence
on
the
spirit
of
the
government
will
be
composed
of
landholders
merchants
and
men
of
the
learned
professions

the
main
premise
was
the
same
to
govern
was
an
instinct
that
appeared
according
to
your
social
preferences
in
one
man
or
a
chosen
few
in
all
males
or
only
in
males
who
were
white
and
perhaps
even
in
all
men
and
all
women
in
deciding
who
was
most
fit
to
govern
knowledge
of
the
world
was
taken
for
granted
the
aristocrat
believed
that
those
who
dealt
with
large
affairs
possessed
the
instinct
the
democrats
asserted
that
all
men
possessed
the
instinct
and
could
therefore
deal
with
large
affairs
it
was
no
part
of
political
science
in
either
case
to
think
out
how
knowledge
of
the
world
could
be
brought
to
the
ruler
if
you
were
for
the
people
you
did
not
try
to
work
out
the
question
of
how
to
keep
the
voter
informed
by
the
age
of
he
had
his
political
faculties
what
counted
was
a
good
heart
a
reasoning
mind
a
balanced
judgment
these
would
ripen
with
age
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
consider
how
to
inform
the
heart
and
feed
the
reason
men
took
in
their
facts
as
they
took
in
their
breath
but
the
facts
men
could
come
to
possess
in
this
effortless
way
were
limited
they
could
know
the
customs
and
more
obvious
character
of
the
place
where
they
lived
and
worked
but
the
outer
world
they
had
to
conceive
and
they
did
not
conceive
it
instinctively
nor
absorb
trustworthy
knowledge
of
it
just
by
living
therefore
the
only
environment
in
which
spontaneous
politics
were
possible
was
one
confined
within
the
range
of
the
ruler
direct
and
certain
knowledge
there
is
no
escaping
this
conclusion
wherever
you
found
government
on
the
natural
range
of
men
faculties
if
as
aristotle
said
footnote
bk
vii
ch
the
citizens
of
a
state
are
to
judge
and
distribute
offices
according
to
merit
then
they
must
know
each
other
characters
where
they
do
not
possess
this
knowledge
both
the
election
to
offices
and
the
decision
of
law
suits
will
go
wrong
obviously
this
maxim
was
binding
upon
every
school
of
political
thought
but
it
presented
peculiar
difficulties
to
the
democrats
those
who
believed
in
class
government
could
fairly
claim
that
in
the
court
of
the
king
or
in
the
country
houses
of
the
gentry
men
did
know
each
other
characters
and
as
long
as
the
rest
of
mankind
was
passive
the
only
characters
one
needed
to
know
were
the
characters
of
men
in
the
ruling
class
but
the
democrats
who
wanted
to
raise
the
dignity
of
all
men
were
immediately
involved
by
the
immense
size
and
confusion
of
their
ruling
class
the
male
electorate
their
science
told
them
that
politics
was
an
instinct
and
that
the
instinct
worked
in
a
limited
environment
their
hopes
bade
them
insist
that
all
men
in
a
very
large
environment
could
govern
in
this
deadly
conflict
between
their
ideals
and
their
science
the
only
way
out
was
to
assume
without
much
discussion
that
the
voice
of
the
people
was
the
voice
of
god
the
paradox
was
too
great
the
stakes
too
big
their
ideal
too
precious
for
critical
examination
they
could
not
show
how
a
citizen
of
boston
was
to
stay
in
boston
and
conceive
the
views
of
a
virginian
how
a
virginian
in
virginia
could
have
real
opinions
about
the
government
at
washington
how
congressmen
in
washington
could
have
opinions
about
china
or
mexico
for
in
that
day
it
was
not
possible
for
many
men
to
have
an
unseen
environment
brought
into
the
field
of
their
judgment
there
had
been
some
advances
to
be
sure
since
aristotle
there
were
a
few
newspapers
and
there
were
books
better
roads
perhaps
and
better
ships
but
there
was
no
great
advance
and
the
political
assumptions
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
essentially
to
be
those
that
had
prevailed
in
political
science
for
two
thousand
years
the
pioneer
democrats
did
not
possess
the
material
for
resolving
the
conflict
between
the
known
range
of
man
attention
and
their
illimitable
faith
in
his
dignity
their
assumptions
antedated
not
only
the
modern
newspaper
the
press
services
photography
and
moving
pictures
but
what
is
really
more
significant
they
antedated
measurement
and
record
quantitative
and
comparative
analysis
the
canons
of
evidence
and
the
ability
of
psychological
analysis
to
correct
and
discount
the
prejudices
of
the
witness
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
our
records
are
satisfactory
our
analysis
unbiased
our
measurements
sound
i
do
mean
to
say
that
the
key
inventions
have
been
made
for
bringing
the
unseen
world
into
the
field
of
judgment
they
had
not
been
made
in
the
time
of
aristotle
and
they
were
not
yet
important
enough
to
be
visible
for
political
theory
in
the
age
of
rousseau
montesquieu
or
thomas
jefferson
in
a
later
chapter
i
think
we
shall
see
that
even
in
the
latest
theory
of
human
reconstruction
that
of
the
english
guild
socialists
all
the
deeper
premises
have
been
taken
over
from
this
older
system
of
political
thought
that
system
whenever
it
was
competent
and
honest
had
to
assume
that
no
man
could
have
more
than
a
very
partial
experience
of
public
affairs
in
the
sense
that
he
can
give
only
a
little
time
to
them
that
assumption
is
still
true
and
of
the
utmost
consequence
but
ancient
theory
was
compelled
to
assume
not
only
that
men
could
give
little
attention
to
public
questions
but
that
the
attention
available
would
have
to
be
confined
to
matters
close
at
hand
it
would
have
been
visionary
to
suppose
that
a
time
would
come
when
distant
and
complicated
events
could
conceivably
be
reported
analyzed
and
presented
in
such
a
form
that
a
really
valuable
choice
could
be
made
by
an
amateur
that
time
is
now
in
sight
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
that
the
continuous
reporting
of
an
unseen
environment
is
feasible
it
is
often
done
badly
but
the
fact
that
it
is
done
at
all
shows
that
it
can
be
done
and
the
fact
that
we
begin
to
know
how
badly
it
is
often
done
shows
that
it
can
be
done
better
with
varying
degrees
of
skill
and
honesty
distant
complexities
are
reported
every
day
by
engineers
and
accountants
for
business
men
by
secretaries
and
civil
servants
for
officials
by
intelligence
officers
for
the
general
staff
by
some
journalists
for
some
readers
these
are
crude
beginnings
but
radical
far
more
radical
in
the
literal
meaning
of
that
word
than
the
repetition
of
wars
revolutions
abdications
and
restorations
as
radical
as
the
change
in
the
scale
of
human
life
which
has
made
it
possible
for
lloyd
george
to
discuss
welsh
coal
mining
after
breakfast
in
london
and
the
fate
of
the
arabs
before
dinner
in
paris
for
the
possibility
of
bringing
any
aspect
of
human
affairs
within
the
range
of
judgment
breaks
the
spell
which
has
lain
upon
political
ideas
there
have
of
course
been
plenty
of
men
who
did
not
realize
that
the
range
of
attention
was
the
main
premise
of
political
science
they
have
built
on
sand
they
have
demonstrated
in
their
own
persons
the
effects
of
a
very
limited
and
knowledge
of
the
world
but
for
the
political
thinkers
who
have
counted
from
plato
and
aristotle
through
machiavelli
and
hobbes
to
the
democratic
theorists
speculation
has
revolved

had

the
whole

of
a
few

groups
of
people
would
engage

always
been
evident
this
much
truth
there
is
at
any
rate
in
that
famous
passage
in
the
leviathan
where
hobbes
says
that
though
there
had
never
been
any

particular
men
were
in

of
war

at

of
the
natural
condition
of
mankind
as
concerning
their
felicity
and
misery
to
circumvent
this
conclusion
one
great
branch
of
human
thought
which
had
and
has
many
schools
proceeded
in
this
fashion
it
conceived
an
ideally
just
pattern
of
human
relations
in
which
each
person
had
well
defined
functions
and
rights
if
he
conscientiously
filled
the

him

he

his
and
all
the
dutiful

every
caste
system
illustrates
this
principle
you
find
it
in
plato
republic
and
in
aristotle
in
the
feudal
ideal
in
the
circles
of
dante
paradise
in
the

concord
would
be
heard
if
each

improvised
as
he
went
along
but
there
have
also
been
philosophers
who
were
bored
by
these
schemes
of
rights
and
duties
took
conflict
for
granted
and
tried
to
see
how
their
side
might
come
out
on
top
they
have
always
seemed
more
realistic
even
when
they
seemed
alarming
because
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
generalize
the
experience
that
nobody
could
escape
machiavelli
is
the
classic
of
this
school
a
man
most
mercilessly
maligned

are
done
into

in

most
infamous
chapter
footnote
ch
xviii
concerning
the
way
in
which
princes
should
keep
faith
translation
by
k
marriott
he
wrote
that
a
prince
ought
to
take
care
that
he
never
lets
anything
slip
from
his
lips
that
is
not
replete
with
the
five
qualities
that
he
may
appear
to
him
who
hears
and
sees
him
altogether
merciful
faithful
humane
upright
and
religious
there
is
nothing
more
necessary
to
appear
to
have
than
this
last
quality
inasmuch
as
men
judge
generally
more
by
the
eye
than
by
the
hand
because
it
belongs
to
everybody
to
see
you
to
few
to
come
in
touch
with
you
everyone
sees
what
you
appear
to
be
few
really
know
what
you
are
and
those
few
dare
not
oppose
themselves
to
the
opinion
of
the
many
who
have
the
majesty
of
the
state
to
defend
them
and
in
the
actions
of
all
men
and
especially
of
princes
which
it
is
not
prudent
to
challenge
one
judges
by
the
result
one
prince
of
the
present
time
whom
it
is
not
well
to
name
never
preaches
anything
else
but
peace
and
good
faith
and
to
both
he
is
most
hostile
and
either
if
he
had
kept
it
would
have
deprived
him
of
reputation
and
kingdom
many
a
time
that
is
cynical
but
it
is
the
cynicism
of
a
man
who
saw
truly
without
knowing
quite
why
he
saw
what
he
saw
machiavelli
is
thinking
of
the
run
of
men
and
princes
who
judge
generally
more
by
the
eye
than
by
the
hand
which
is
his
way
of
saying
that
their
judgments
are
subjective
he
was
too
close
to
earth
to
pretend
that
the
italians
of
his
day
saw
the
world
steadily
and
saw
it
whole
he
would
not
indulge
in
fantasies
and
he
had
not
the
materials
for
imagining
a
race
of
men
that
had
learned
how
to
correct
their
vision
the
world
as
he
found
it
was
composed
of
people
whose
vision
could
rarely
be
corrected
and
machiavelli
knew
that
such
people
since
they
see
all
public
relations
in
a
private
way
are
involved
in
perpetual
strife
what
they
see
is
their
own
personal
class
dynastic
or
municipal
version
of
affairs
that
in
reality
extend
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
their
vision
they
see
their
aspect
they
see
it
as
right
but
they
cross
other
people
who
are
similarly
then
their
very
existence
is
endangered
or
at
least
what
they
for
unsuspected
private
reasons
regard
as
their
existence
and
take
to
be
a
danger
the
end
which
is
impregnably
based
on
a
real
though

experience
justifies
the
means
they
will
sacrifice

have
to

corruption

furnished
an

however
much
of
the
romantic
return
to
nature
may
have
entered
into
this
exclamation
there
was
also
an
element
of
solid
sense
jefferson
was
right
in
thinking
that
a
group
of
independent
farmers
comes
nearer
to
fulfilling
the
requirements
of
spontaneous
democracy
than
any
other
human
society
but
if
you
are
to
preserve
the
ideal
you
must
fence
off
these
ideal
communities
from
the
abominations
of
the
world
if
the
farmers
are
to
manage
their
own
affairs
they
must
confine
affairs
to
those
they
are
accustomed
to
managing
jefferson
drew
all
these
logical
conclusions
he
disapproved
of
manufacture
of
foreign
commerce
and
a
navy
of
intangible
forms
of
property
and
in
theory
of
any
form
of
government
that
was
not
centered
in
the
small
group
he
had
critics
in
his
day
one
of
them
remarked
that
wrapt
up
in
the
fullness
of
and
strong
enough
in
reality
to
defend
ourselves
against
every
invader
we
might
enjoy
an
eternal
rusticity

political
science

purposes
it
was

the
necessity
that
in
jefferson
time
no
one
could
have
conceived
public
opinions
that
were
not
spontaneous
and
subjective
the
democratic
tradition
is
therefore
always
trying
to
see
a
world
where
people
are
exclusively
concerned
with
affairs

which
the
causes

effects
all
operate

has
democratic
theory
been
able
to
conceive
itself
in
the

a
wide
and
unpredictable
environment
the
mirror
is
concave
and
although
democrats
recognize
that
they
are
in
contact
with
external
affairs
they
see
quite
surely
that
every
contact
outside
that
group
is
a
threat
to
democracy
as
originally
conceived
that
is
a
wise
fear
if
democracy
is
to
be
spontaneous
the

of

must
remain

the

an
analysis

public
opinion
seems
to
demonstrate
that

are

apathy

what
one
of

called

willingness

the
democrats
had
caught
sight
of
a
dazzling
possibility
that
every
human
being
should
rise
to
his
full
stature
freed
from
limitations
with
what
they
knew
of
the
art
of
government
they
could
no
more
than
aristotle
before
them
conceive
a
society
of
autonomous
individuals
except
an
enclosed
and
simple
one
they
could
then
select
no
other
premise
if
they
were
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
all
the
people
could
spontaneously
manage
their
public
affairs
having
adopted
the
premise
because
it
was
necessary
to
their
keenest
hope
they
drew
other
conclusions
as
well
since
in
order
to
have
spontaneous
you
had
to
have
a
simple
community
they
took
it
for
granted
that
one
man
was
as
competent
as
the
next
to
manage
these
simple
and
affairs
where
the
wish
is
father
to
the
thought
such
logic
is
convincing
moreover
the
doctrine
of
the
omnicompetent
citizen
is
for
most
practical
purposes
true
in
the
rural
township
everybody
in
a
village
sooner
or
later
tries
his
hand
at
everything
the
village
does
there
is
rotation
in
office
by
men
who
are
jacks
of
all
trades
there
was
no
serious
trouble
with
the
doctrine
of
the
omnicompetent
citizen
until
the
democratic
stereotype
was
universally
applied
so
that
men
looked
at
a
complicated
civilization
and
saw
an
enclosed
village
not
only
was
the
individual
citizen
fitted
to
deal
with
all
public
affairs
but
he
was
consistently
and
endowed
with
unflagging
interest
he
was
enough
in
the
township
where
he
knew
everybody
and
was
interested
in
everybody
business
the
idea
of
enough
for
the
township
turned
easily
into
the
idea
of
enough
for
any
purpose
for
as
we
have
noted
quantitative
thinking
does
not
suit
a
stereotype
but
there
was
another
turn
to
the
circle
since
everybody
was
assumed
to
be
interested
enough
in
important
affairs
only
those
affairs
came
to
seem
important
in
which
everybody
was
interested
this
meant
that
men
formed
their
picture
of
the
world
outside
from
the
unchallenged
pictures
in
their
heads
these
pictures
came
to
them
well
stereotyped
by
their
parents
and
teachers
and
were
little
corrected
by
their
own
experience
only
a
few
men
had
affairs
that
took
them
across
state
lines
even
fewer
had
reason
to
go
abroad
most
voters
lived
their
whole
lives
in
one
environment
and
with
nothing
but
a
few
feeble
newspapers
some
pamphlets
political
speeches
their
religious
training
and
rumor
to
go
on
they
had
to
conceive
that
larger
environment
of
commerce
and
finance
of
war
and
peace
the
number
of
public
opinions
based
on
any
objective
report
was
very
small
in
proportion
to
those
based
on
casual
fancy
and
so
for
many
different
reasons
was
a
spiritual
ideal
in
the
formative
period
the
physical
isolation
of
the
township
the
loneliness
of
the
pioneer
the
theory
of
democracy
the
protestant
tradition
and
the
limitations
of
political
science
all
converged
to
make
men
believe
that
out
of
their
own
consciences
they
must
extricate
political
wisdom
it
is
not
strange
that
the
deduction
of
laws
from
absolute
principles
should
have
usurped
so
much
of
their
free
energy
the
american
political
mind
had
to
live
on
its
capital
in
legalism
it
found
a
tested
body
of
rules
from
which
new
rules
could
be
spun
without
the
labor
of
earning
new
truths
from
experience
the
formulae
became
so
curiously
sacred
that
every
good
foreign
observer
has
been
amazed
at
the
contrast
between
the
dynamic
practical
energy
of
the
american
people
and
the
static
theorism
of
their
public
life
that
steadfast
love
of
fixed
principles
was
simply
the
only
way
known
of
achieving
but
it
meant
that
the
public
opinions
of
any
one
community
about
the
outer
world
consisted
chiefly
of
a
few
stereotyped
images
arranged
in
a
pattern
deduced
from
their
legal
and
their
moral
codes
and
animated
by
the
feeling
aroused
by
local
experiences
thus
democratic
theory
starting
from
its
fine
vision
of
ultimate
human
dignity
was
forced
by
lack
of
the
instruments
of
knowledge
for
reporting
its
environment
to
fall
back
upon
the
wisdom
and
experience
which
happened
to
have
accumulated

the
voter

virtue
these
chosen
people
in
their
environment
had
all
the
facts
before
them
the
environment
was
so
familiar
that
one
could
take
it
for
granted
that
men
were
talking
about
substantially
the
same
things
the
only
real
disagreements
therefore
would
be
in
judgments
about
the
same
facts
there
was
no
need
to
guarantee
the
sources
of
information

rudimentary

into

conceive

can

it
was
carefully

was
established

convictions
who
stated
them
bluntly
there
was
little
real
discrepancy
between
their
public
and
their
private
views
but
jefferson
mind
was
a
mass
of
ambiguities
not
solely
because
of
its
defects
as
hamilton
and
his
biographers
have
thought
but
because
he
believed
in
a
union
and
he
believed
in
spontaneous
democracies
and
in
the
political
science
of
his
age
there
was
no
satisfactory
way
to
reconcile
the
two
jefferson
was
confused
in
thought
and
action
because
he
had
a
vision
of
a
new
and
tremendous
idea
that
no
one
had
thought
out
in
all
its
bearings
but
though
popular
sovereignty
was
not
clearly
understood
by
anybody
it
seemed
to
imply
so
great
an
enhancement
of
human
life
that
no
constitution
could
stand
which
frankly
denied
it
the
frank
denials
were
therefore
expunged
from
consciousness
and
the
document
which
is
on
its
face
an
honest
example
of
limited
constitutional
democracy
was
talked
and
thought
about
as
an
instrument
for
direct
popular
rule
jefferson
actually
reached
the
point
of
believing
that
the
federalists
had
perverted
the
constitution
of
which
in
his
fancy
they
were
no
longer
the
authors
and
so
the
constitution
was
in
spirit
rewritten
partly
by
actual
amendment
partly
by
practice
as
in
the
case
of
the
electoral
college
but
chiefly
by
looking
at
it
through
another
set
of
stereotypes
the
facade
was
no
longer
permitted
to
look
oligarchic
the
american
people
came
to
believe
that
their
constitution
was
a
democratic
instrument
and
treated
it
as
such
they
owe
that
fiction
to
the
victory
of
thomas
jefferson
and
a
great
conservative
fiction
it
has
been
it
is
a
fair
guess
that
if
everyone
had
always
regarded
the
constitution
as
did
the
authors
of
it
the
constitution
would
have
been
violently
overthrown
because
loyalty
to
the
constitution
and
loyalty
to
democracy
would
have
seemed
incompatible
jefferson
resolved
that
paradox
by
teaching
the
american
people
to
read
the
constitution
as
an
expression
of
democracy
he
himself
stopped
there
but
in
the
course
of
years
or
so
social
conditions
had
changed
so
radically
that
andrew

carried
out
the
political

which
jefferson
had
prepared

tradition

has
any

to
henry
jones

the
political
center
of
that
revolution

the
question

the
men
who
founded
the

public
office
was
regarded
as
a
species
of
property
not
lightly
to
be
disturbed
and
it
was
undoubtedly
their
hope
that
the
offices
would
remain
in
the
hands
of
their
social
class
but
the
democratic
theory
had
as
one
of
its
main
principles
the
doctrine
of
the
omnicompetent
citizen
therefore
when
people
began
to
look
at
the
constitution
as
a
democratic
instrument
it
was
certain
that
permanence
in
office
would
seem
undemocratic
the
natural
ambitions
of
men
coincided
here
with
the
great
moral
impulse
of
their
age
jefferson
had
popularized
the
idea
without
carrying
it
ruthlessly
into
practice
and
removals
on
party
grounds
were
comparatively
few
under
the
virginian
presidents
it
was
jackson
who
founded
the
practice
of
turning
public
office
into
patronage
curious
as
it
sounds
to
us
the
principle
of
rotation
in
office
with
short
terms
was
regarded
as
a
great
reform
not
only
did
it
acknowledge
the
new
dignity
of
the
average
man
by
treating
him
as
fit
for
any
office

did
it
destroy
the
monopoly
of
a
small
social
class

appear
to
open
careers
to
talent

it
had
been
advocated
for
centuries
as

remedy
for
political
corruption

as
the
one
way
to
prevent
the
creation
of

bureaucracy

the
practice

rapid
change
in

the
application
to

from

did
not

did
for

classes

often
fail
to
realize
how
much
of
the
stability
of
our
government
we
owe
to
patronage
for
it
was
patronage
that
weaned
natural
leaders
from
too
much
attachment
to
the
community
it
was
patronage
that
weakened
the
local
spirit
and
brought
together
in
some
kind
of
peaceful
cooperation
the
very
men
who
as
provincial
celebrities
would
in
the
absence
of
a
sense
of
common
interest
have
torn
the
union
apart
but
of
course
the
democratic
theory
was
not
supposed
to
produce
a
new
governing
class

it
has
never
accommodated
itself
to
the
fact
when
the
democrat
wanted
to
abolish
monopoly
of
offices
to
have
rotation

the
idea
of

class
of
politicians
was
just
what
the
democrat
did
not
like
but
he
could
not

what

and
so
while
the
revolution
under
jefferson
and
jackson
produced
the
patronage
which
made
the
two
party
system
which
created
a
substitute
for
the
rule
of
the
gentry
and
a
discipline
for
governing
the
deadlock
of
the
checks
and
balances
all
that
happened
as
it
were
invisibly
thus
rotation
in
office
might
be
the
ostensible
theory
in
practice
the
offices
oscillated
between
the
henchmen
tenure
might
not
be
a
permanent
monopoly
but
the
professional
politician
was
permanent
government
might
be
as
president
harding
once
said
a
simple
thing
but
winning
elections
was
a
sophisticated
performance
the
salaries
in
office
might
be
as
ostentatiously
frugal
as
jefferson
but
the
expenses
of
party
organization
and
the
fruits
of
victory
were
in
the
grand
manner
the
stereotype
of
democracy
controlled
the
visible
government
the
corrections
the
exceptions
and
adaptations
of
the
american
people
to
the
real
facts
of
their
environment
have
had
to
be
invisible
even
when
everybody
knew
all
about
them
it
was
only
the
words
of
the
law
the
speeches
of
politicians
the
platforms
and
the
formal
machinery
of
administration
that
have
had
to
conform
to
the
pristine
image
of
democracy
if
one
had
asked
a
philosophical
democrat
how
these
communities
were
to
coöperate
when
their
public
opinions
were
so
he
would
have
pointed
to
representative
government
embodied
in
the
congress
and
nothing
would
surprise
him
more
than
the
discovery
of
how
steadily
the
prestige
of
representative
government
has
declined
while
the
power
of
the
presidency
has
grown
some
critics
have
traced
this
to
the
custom
of
sending
only
local
celebrities
to
washington
they
have
thought
that
if
congress
could
consist
of
the
nationally
eminent
men
the
life
of
the
capital
would
be
more
brilliant
it
would
be
of
course
and
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
retiring
presidents
and
cabinet
officers
followed
the
example
of
john
quincy
adams
but
the
absence
of
these
men
does
not
explain
the
plight
of
congress
for
its
decline
began
when
it
was
relatively
the
most
eminent
branch
of
the
government
indeed
it
is
more
probable
that
the
reverse
is
true
and
that
congress
ceased
to
attract
the
eminent
as
it
lost
direct
influence
on
the
shaping
of
national
policy
the
main
reason
for
the
discredit
which
is
world
wide
is
i
think
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
a
congress
of
representatives
is
essentially
a
group
of
blind
men
in
a
vast
unknown
world
with
some
exceptions
the
only
method
recognized
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
theory
of
representative
government
by
which
congress
can
inform
itself
is
to
exchange
opinions
from
the
districts
there
is
no
systematic
adequate
and
authorized
way
for
congress
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
the
theory
is
that
the
best
man
of
each
district
brings
the
best
wisdom
of
his
constituents
to
a
central
place
and
that
all
these
wisdoms
combined
are
all
the
wisdom
that
congress
needs
now
there
is
no
need
to
question
the
value
of
expressing
local
opinions
and
exchanging
them
congress
has
great
value
as
the
of
a
continental
nation
in
the
coatrooms
the
hotel
lobbies
the
boarding
houses
of
capitol
hill
at
the
of
the
congressional
matrons
and
from
occasional
entries
into
the
drawing
rooms
of
cosmopolitan
washington
new
vistas
are
opened
and
wider
horizons
but
even
if
the
theory
were
applied
and
the
districts
always
sent
their
wisest
men
the
sum
or
a
combination
of
local
impressions
is
not
a
wide
enough
base
for
national
policy
and
no
base
at
all
for
the
control
of
foreign
policy
since
the
real
effects
of
most
laws
are
subtle
and
hidden
they
can
not
be
understood
by
filtering
local
experiences
through
local
states
of
mind
they
can
be
known
only
by
controlled
reporting
and
objective
analysis
and
just
as
the
head
of
a
large
factory
can
not
know
how
efficient
it
is
by
talking
to
the
foreman
but
must
examine
cost
sheets
and
data
that
only
an
accountant
can
dig
out
for
him
so
the
lawmaker
does
not
arrive
at
a
true
picture
of
the
state
of
the
union
by
putting
together
a
mosaic
of
local
pictures
he
needs
to
know
the
local
pictures
but
unless
he
possesses
instruments
for
calibrating
them
one
picture
is
as
good
as
the
next
and
a
great
deal
better
the
president
does
come
to
the
assistance
of
congress
by
delivering
messages
on
the
state
of
the
union
he
is
in
a
position
to
do
that
because
he
presides
over
a
vast
collection
of
bureaus
and
their
agents
which
report
as
well
as
act
but
he
tells
congress
what
he
chooses
to
tell
it
he
can
not
be
heckled
and
the
censorship
as
to
what
is
compatible
with
the
public
interest
is
in
his
hands
it
is
a
wholly
and
tricky
relationship
which
sometimes
reaches
such
heights
of
absurdity
that
congress
in
order
to
secure
an
important
document
has
to
thank
the
enterprise
of
a
chicago
newspaper
or
the
calculated
indiscretion
of
a
subordinate
official
so
bad
is
the
contact
of
legislators
with
necessary
facts
that
they
are
forced
to
rely
either
on
private
tips
or
on
that
legalized
atrocity
the
congressional
investigation
where
congressmen
starved
of
their
legitimate
food
for
thought
go
on
a
wild
and
feverish
and
do
not
stop
at
cannibalism
except
for
the
little
that
these
investigations
yield
the
occasional
communications
from
the
executive
departments
interested
and
disinterested
data
collected
by
private
persons
such
newspapers
periodicals
and
books
as
congressmen
read
and
a
new
and
excellent
practice
of
calling
for
help
from
expert
bodies
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
tariff
commission
the
creation
of
congressional
opinion
is
incestuous
from
this
it
follows
either
that
legislation
of
a
national
character
is
prepared
by
a
few
informed
insiders
and
put
through
by
partisan
force
or
that
the
legislation
is
broken
up
into
a
collection
of
local
items
each
of
which
is
enacted
for
a
local
reason
tariff
schedules
navy
yards
army
posts
rivers
and
harbors
post
offices
and
federal
buildings
pensions
and
patronage
these
are
fed
out
to
concave
communities
as
tangible
evidence
of
the
benefits
of
national
life
being
concave
they
can
see
the
white
marble
building
which
rises
out
of
federal
funds
to
raise
local
realty
values
and
employ
local
contractors
more
readily
than
they
can
judge
the
cumulative
cost
of
the
pork
barrel
it
is
fair
to
say
that
in
a
large
assembly
of
men
each
of
whom
has
practical
knowledge
only
of
his
own
district
laws
dealing
with
translocal
affairs
are
rejected
or
accepted
by
the
mass
of
congressmen
without
creative
participation
of
any
kind
they
participate
only
in
making
those
laws
that
can
be
treated
as
a
bundle
of
local
issues
for
a
legislature
without
effective
means
of
information
and
analysis
must
oscillate
between
blind
regularity
tempered
by
occasional
insurgency
and
logrolling
and
it
is
the
logrolling
which
makes
the
regularity
palatable
because
it
is
by
logrolling
that
a
congressman
proves
to
his
more
active
constituents
that
he
is
watching
their
interests
as
they
conceive
them
this
is
no
fault
of
the
individual
congressman
except
when
he
is
complacent
about
it
the
cleverest
and
most
industrious
representative
can
not
hope
to
understand
a
fraction
of
the
bills
on
which
he
votes
the
best
he
can
do
is
to
specialize
on
a
few
bills
and
take
somebody
word
about
the
rest
i
have
known
congressmen
when
they
were
boning
up
on
a
subject
to
study
as
they
had
not
studied
since
they
passed
their
final
examinations
many
large
cups
of
black
coffee
wet
towels
and
all
they
had
to
dig
for
information
sweat
over
arranging
and
verifying
facts
which
in
any
consciously
organized
government
should
have
been
easily
available
in
a
form
suitable
for
decision
and
even
when
they
really
knew
a
subject
their
anxieties
had
only
begun
for
back
home
the
editors
the
board
of
trade
the
central
federated
union
and
the
women
clubs
had
spared
themselves
these
labors
and
were
prepared
to
view
the
congressman
performance
through
local
spectacles
what
patronage
did
to
attach
political
chieftains
to
the
national
government

infinite
variety
of
local
subsidies
and
privileges

for
communities
patronage
and
pork
amalgamate
and
stabilize
thousands
of
special
opinions
local
discontents
private
ambitions
there
are
but
two
other
alternatives
one
is
government
by
terror
and
obedience
the
other
is
government
based
on
such
a
highly
developed
system
of
information
analysis
and
that
the
knowledge
of
national
circumstances
and
reasons
of
state
is
evident
to
all
men
the
autocratic
system
is
in
decay
the
voluntary
system
is
in
its
very
earliest
development
and
so
in
calculating
the
prospects
of
association
among
large
groups
of
people
a
league
of
nations
industrial
government
or
a
federal
union
of
states
the
degree
to
which
the
material
for
a
common
consciousness
exists
determines
how
far
cooperation
will
depend
upon
force
or
upon
the
milder
alternative
to
force
which
is
patronage
and
privilege
the
secret
of
great
like
alexander
hamilton
is
that
they
know
how
to
calculate
these
principles

old
image
in

guild
socialism
whenever
the
quarrels
of
groups
become
unbearable
reformers
in
the
past
found
themselves
forced
to
choose
between
two
great
alternatives
they
could
take
the
path
to
rome
and
impose
a
roman
peace
upon
the
warring
tribes
they
could
take
the
path
to
isolation
to
autonomy
and
almost
always
they
chose
that
path
which
they
had
least
recently
travelled
if
they
had
tried
out
the
deadening
monotony
of
empire
they
cherished
above
all
other
things
the
simple
freedom
of
their
own
community
but
if
they
had
seen
this
simple
freedom
squandered
in
parochial
jealousies
they
longed
for
the
spacious
order
of
a
great
and
powerful
state
whichever
choice
they
made
the
essential
difficulty
was
the
same
if
decisions
were
decentralized
they
soon
floundered
in
a
chaos
of
local
opinions
if
they
were
centralized
the
policy
of
the
state
was
based
on
the
opinions
of
a
small
social
set
at
the
capital
in
any
case
force
was
necessary
to
defend
one
local
right
against
another
or
to
impose
law
and
order
on
the
localities
or
to
resist
class
government
at
the
center
or
to
defend
the
whole
society
centralized
or
decentralized
against
the
outer
barbarian
modern
democracy
and
the
industrial
system
were
both
born
in
a
time
of
reaction
against
kings
crown
government
and
a
regime
of
detailed
economic
regulation
in
the
industrial
sphere
this
reaction
took
the
form
of
extreme
devolution
known
as
individualism
each
economic
decision
was
to
be
made
by
the
man
who
had
title
to
the
property
involved
since
almost
everything
was
owned
by
somebody
there
would
be
somebody
to
manage
everything
this
was
plural
sovereignty
with
a
vengeance
it
was
economic
government
by
anybody
economic
philosophy
though
it
was
supposed
to
be
controlled
by
immutable
laws
of
political
economy
that
must
in
the
end
produce
harmony
it
produced
many
splendid
things
but
enough
sordid
and
terrible
ones
to
start
one
of
these
was
the
trust
which
established
a
kind
of
roman
peace
within
industry
and
a
roman
predatory
imperialism
outside
people
turned
to
the
legislature
for
relief
they
invoked
representative
government
founded
on
the
image
of
the
township
farmer
to
regulate
the
corporations
the
working
class
turned
to
labor
organization
there
followed
a
period
of
increasing
centralization
and
a
sort
of
race
of
armaments
the
trusts
interlocked
the
craft
unions
federated
and
combined
into
a
labor
movement
the
political
system
grew
stronger
at
washington
and
weaker
in
the
states
as
the
reformers
tried
to
match
its
strength
against
big
business
in
this
period
practically
all
the
schools
of
socialist
thought
from
the
marxian
left
to
the
new
nationalists
around
theodore
roosevelt
looked
upon
centralization
as
the
first
stage
of
an
evolution
which
would
end
in
the
absorption
of
all
the
powers
of
business
by
the
political
state
the
evolution
never
took
place
except
for
a
few
months
during
the
war
that
was
enough
and
there
was
a
turn
of
the
wheel
against
the
omnivorous
state
in
favor
of
several
new
forms
of
pluralism
but
this
time
society
was
to
swing
back
not
to
the
atomic
individualism
of
adam
smith
economic
man
and
thomas
jefferson
farmer
but
to
a
sort
of
molecular
individualism
of
voluntary
groups
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
all
these
oscillations
of
theory
is
that
each
in
turn
promises
a
world
in
which
no
one
will
have
to
follow
machiavelli
in
order
to
survive
they
are
all
established
by
some
form
of
coercion
they
all
exercise
coercion
in

to
maintain
themselves
and

a
result
of
coercion
yet
they
do
not
accept
coercion
either
physical
power
or
special
position
patronage
or

society
in
being
what
keeps
it
running
as
a
society
cole
has
two
answers
to
this
question
one
is
the
orthodox
marxian
answer
that
the
abolition
of
capitalist
property
will
remove
the
motive
to
aggression
yet
he
does
not
really
believe
that
because
if
he
did
he
would
care
as
little
as
does
the
average
marxian
how
the
working
class
is
to
run
the
government
once
it
is
in
control
if
his
diagnosis
were
correct
the
marxian
would
be
quite
right
if
the
disease
were
the
capitalist
class
and
only
the
capitalist
class
salvation
would
automatically
follow
its
extinction
but
cole
is
enormously
concerned
about
whether
the
society
which
follows
the
revolution
is
to
be
run
by
state
collectivism
by
guilds
or
cooperative
societies
by
a
democratic
parliament
or
by
functional
representation
in
fact
it
is
as
a
new
theory
of
representative
government
that
guild
socialism
challenges
attention
the
guildsmen
do
not
expect
a
miracle
to
result
from
the
disappearance
of
capitalist
property
rights
they
do
expect
and
of
course
quite
rightly
that
if
equality
of
income
were
the
rule
social
relations
would
be
profoundly
altered
but
they
differ
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
from
the
orthodox
russian
communist
in
this
respect
the
communist
proposes
to
establish
equality
by
force
of
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
believing
that
if
once
people
were
equalized
both
in
income
and
in
service
they
would
then
lose
the
incentives
to
aggression
the
guildsmen
also
propose
to
establish
equality
by
force
but
are
shrewd
enough
to
see
that
if
an
equilibrium
is
to
be
maintained
they
have
to
provide
institutions
for
maintaining
it
guildsmen
therefore
put
their
faith
in
what
they
believe
to
be
a
new
theory
of
democracy
their
object
says
cole
is
to
get
the
mechanism
right
and
to
adjust
it
as
far
as
possible
to
the
expression
of
men
social
wills
reference
p
these
wills
need
to
be
given
opportunity
for
in
in
any
and
every
form
of
social
action
behind
these
words
is
the
true
democratic
impulse
the
desire
to
enhance
human
dignity
as
well
as
the
traditional
assumption
that
this
human
dignity
is
impugned
unless
each
person
will
enters
into
the
management
of
everything
that
affects
him
the
guildsman
like
the
earlier
democrat
therefore
looks
about
him
for
an
environment
in
which
this
ideal
of
can
be
realized
a
hundred
years
and
more
have
passed
since
rousseau
and
jefferson
and
the
center
of
interest
has
shifted
from
the
country
to
the
city
the
new
democrat
can
no
longer
turn
to
the
idealized
rural
township
for
the
image
of
democracy
he
turns
now
to
the
workshop
the
spirit
of
association
must
be
given
free
play
in
the
sphere
in
which
it
is
best
able
to
find
expression
this
is
manifestly
the
factory
in
which
men
have
the
habit
and
tradition
of
working
together
the
factory
is
the
natural
and
fundamental
unit
of
industrial
democracy
this
involves
not
only
that
the
factory
must
be
free
as
far
as
possible
to
manage
its
own
affairs
but
also
that
the
democratic
unit
of
the
factory
must
be
made
the
basis
of
the
larger
democracy
of
the
guild
and
that
the
larger
organs
of
guild
administration
and
government
must
be
based
largely
on
the
principle
of
factory
representation
footnote
p
factory
is
of
course
a
very
loose
word
and
cole
asks
us
to
take
it
as
meaning
mines
shipyards
docks
stations
and
every
place
which
is
a
natural
center
of
production
footnote
but
a
factory
in
this
sense
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
an
industry
the
factory
as
cole
conceives
it
is
a
work
place
where
men
are
really
in
personal
contact
an
environment
small
enough
to
be
known
directly
to
all
the
workers
this
democracy
if
it
is
to
be
real
must
come
home
to
and
be
exercisable
directly
by
every
individual
member
of
the
guild
footnote
p
this
is
important
because
cole
like
jefferson
is
seeking
a
natural
unit
of
government
the
only
natural
unit
is
a
perfectly
familiar
environment
now
a
large
plant
a
railway
system
a
great
coal
field
is
not
a
natural
unit
in
this
sense
unless
it
is
a
very
small
factory
indeed
what
cole
is
really
thinking
about
is
the
shop
that
is
where
men
can
be
supposed
to
have
the
habit
and
tradition
of
working
together
the
rest
of
the
plant
the
rest
of
the
industry
is
an
inferred
environment
anybody
can
see
and
almost
everybody
will
admit
that
in
the
purely
internal
affairs
of
the
shop
is
government
of
affairs
that
can
be
taken
in
at
a
single
view

dispute
would
arise
as
to
what
constitute
the
internal
affairs
of
a
shop
obviously
the
biggest
interests
like
wages
standards
of
production
the
purchase
of
supplies
the
marketing
of
the
product
the
larger
planning
of

are
by
no

freedom

limiting
conditions
from

outside
it
can

laid
out
for
the

can
deal
with
the
temper

can

disputes
above
all
it
can
act
as
a
unit
in
dealing
with
other
shops
and
perhaps
with
the
plant
as
a
whole
but
isolation
is
impossible
the
unit
of
industrial
democracy
is
thoroughly
entangled
in
foreign
affairs
and
it
is
the
management
of
these
external
relations
that
constitutes
the
test
of
the
guild
socialist
theory

have
to
be
managed
by

all
this

its

ascribed
to

be
either
a

aspects

his

be
wrong
than
right
if
it
is
a
generalization
from
the
experience
of
the
individual
shop
as
a
matter
of
experience
the
representatives
of
a
guild
society
would
find
just
as
the
higher
trade

officials
find
today
that
on
a
great
number
of
questions

they
have
to

there
is
no
actual

the
guildsmen
insist
however
that
such
criticism
is
blind
because
it
ignores
a
great
political
discovery
you
may
be
quite
right
they
would
say
in
thinking
that
the
representatives
of
the
shops
would
have
to
make
up
their
own
minds
on
many
questions
about
which
the
shops
have
no
opinion
but
you
are
simply
entangled
in
an
ancient
fallacy
you
are
looking
for
somebody
to
represent
a
group

people

can
not
be

the
only
representative

therefore
each
person
must
help

then
that
the
representatives
speak
not
for

for
certain

in
which
the

are

that
there

between

if
there

there
would
be
no
need
to

now
the
peculiar
virtue
of
functional
democracy
is
supposed
to
be
that
men
vote
candidly
according
to
their
own
interests
which
it
is
assumed
they
know
by
daily
experience
they
can
do
that
within
the
group
but
in
its
external
relations
the
group
as
a
whole
or
its
representative
is
dealing
with
matters
that
transcend
immediate
experience
the
shop
does
not
arrive
spontaneously
at
a
view
of
the
whole
situation
therefore
the
public
opinions
of
a
shop
about
its
rights
and
duties
in
the
industry
and
in
society
are
matters
of
education
or
propaganda
not
the
automatic
product
of
whether
the
guildsmen
elect
a
delegate
or
a
representative
they
do
not
escape
the
problem
of
the
orthodox
democrat
either
the
group
as
a
whole
or
the
elected
spokesman
must
stretch
his
mind
beyond
the
limits
of
direct
experience
he
must
vote
on
questions
coming
up
from
other
shops
and
on
matters
coming
from
beyond
the
frontiers
of
the
whole
industry
the
primary
interest
of
the
shop
does
not
even
cover
the
function
of
a
whole
industrial
vocation
the
function
of
a
vocation
a
great
industry
a
district
a
nation
is
a
concept
not
an
experience
and
has
to
be
imagined
invented
taught
and
believed
and
even
though
you
define
function
as
carefully
as
possible
once
you
admit
that
the
view
of
each
shop
on
that
function
will
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
view
of
other
shops
you
are
saying
that
the
representative
of
one
interest
is
concerned
in
the
proposals
made
by
other
interests
you
are
saying
that
he
must
conceive
a
common
interest
and
in
voting
for
him
you
are
choosing
a
man
who
will
not
simply
represent
your
view
of
your
function
which
is
all
that
you
know
at
first
hand
but
a
man
who
will
represent
your
views
about
other
people

of
that
function
you
are
voting
as
indefinitely
as
the
orthodox
democrat
the
guildsmen
in
their
own
minds
have
solved
the
question
of
how
to
conceive
a
common
interest
by
playing
with
the
word
function
they
imagine
a
society
in
which
all
the
main
work
of
the
world
has
been
analysed
into
functions
and
these
functions
in
turn
synthesized
harmoniously

purposes
of

as
a
whole

essential
agreement
about
the
role
of

organized
group
in
carrying
out
those
purposes
it
was
a
nice
sentiment
therefore
which
led
them
to
take
the
name
of
their
theory
from
an
institution
that
arose
in

catholic
feudal
society

they
should
remember
that
the
scheme

function
which
the
wise
men
of
that
age
assumed
was
not
worked
out

mortal
man

is
unclear
how
the
guildsmen
think
the
scheme
is
going
to
be
worked
out
and
made
acceptable
in
the
modern
world

they
seem
to
argue
that
the
scheme
will
develop
from

at

times
that
the

will
define

are

involved
or
that
his
mind
is
occupied

interested

that
would
determine
the
whole
course
of
his
life
cole
i
am
afraid
leans
towards
john
smith
he
is
answering
the
very
foolish
objection
that
to
vote
by
functions
is
to
be
voting
very
often
if
a
man
is
not
interested
enough
to
vote
and
can
not
be
aroused
to
interest
enough
to
make
him
vote
on
say
a
dozen
distinct
subjects
he
waives
his
right
to
vote
and
the
result
is
no
less
democratic
than
if
he
voted
blindly
and
without
interest
cole
thinks
that
the
uninstructed
voter
waives
his
right
to
vote
from
this
it
follows
that
the
votes
of
the
instructed
reveal
their
interest
and
their
interest
defines
the
function

therefore
have

i
am
considerably
in
doubt
whether
cole
thinks

brown

and
robinson
should
qualify
in
any
election
where
they
assert
that
they
are
interested
or
that
somebody
else
not
named
picks
the
functions
in
which
they
are
entitled
to
be
interested
if
i
were
asked
to
say
what
i
believe
cole
thinks
it
would
be
that
he
has
smoothed
over
the
difficulty
by
the
enormously
strange
assumption
that
it
is
the
uninstructed
voter
who
waives
his
right
to
vote
and
has
concluded
that
whether
functional
voting
is
arranged
by
a
higher
power
or
from
below
on
the
principle
that
a
man
may
vote
when
it
interests
him
to
vote
only
the
instructed
will
be
voting
anyway
and
therefore
the
institution
will
work
but
there
are
two
kinds
of
uninstructed
voter
there
is
the
man
who
does
not
know
and
knows
that
he
does
not
know
he
is
generally
an
enlightened
person
he
is
the
man
who
waives
his
right
to
vote
but
there
is
also
the
man
who
is
uninstructed
and
does
not
know
that
he
is
or
care
he
can
always
be
gotten
to
the
polls
if
the
party
machinery
is
working
his
vote
is
the
basis
of
the
machine
and
since
the
communes
of
the
guild
society
have
large
powers
over
taxation
wages
prices
credit
and
natural
resources
it
would
be
preposterous
to
assume
that
elections
will
not
be
fought
at
least
as
passionately
as
our
own
the
way
people
exhibit
their
interest
will
not
then
delimit
the
functions
of
a
functional
society
there
are
two
other
ways
that
function
might
be
defined
one
would
be
by
the
trade
unions
which
fought
the
battle
that
brought
guild
socialism
into
being
such
a
struggle
would
harden
groups
of
men
together
in
some
sort
of
functional
relation
and
these
groups
would
then
become
the
vested
interests
of
the
guild
socialist
society
some
of
them
like
the
miners
and
railroad
men
would
be
very
strong
and
probably
deeply
attached
to
the
view
of
their
function
which
they
learned
from
the
battle
with
capitalism
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
certain
favorably
placed
trade
unions
would
under
a
socialist
state
become
the
center
of
coherence
and
government
but
a
guild
society
would
inevitably
find
them
a
tough
problem
to
deal
with
for
direct
action
would
have
revealed
their
strategic
power
and
some
of
their
leaders
at
least
would
not
offer
up
this
power
readily
on
the
altar
of
freedom
in
order
to
coordinate
them
guild
society
would
have
to
gather
together
its
strength
and
fairly
soon
one
would
find
i
think
that
the
radicals
under
guild
socialism
would
be
asking
for
communes
strong
enough
to
define
the
functions
of
the
guilds
but
if
you
are
going
to
have
the
government
commune
define
functions
the
premise
of
the
theory
disappears
it
had
to
suppose
that
a
scheme
of
functions
was
obvious
in
order
that
the
concave
shops
would
voluntarily
relate
themselves
to
society
if
there
is
no
settled
scheme
of
functions
in
every
voter
head
he
has
no
better
way
under
guild
socialism
than
under
orthodox
democracy
of
turning
a
opinion
into
a
social
judgment
and
of
course
there
can
be
no
such
settled
scheme
because
even
if
cole
and
his
friends
devised
a
good
one
the
shop
democracies
from
which
all
power
derives
would
judge
the
scheme
in
operation
by
what
they
learn
of
it
and
by
what
they
can
imagine
the
guilds
would
see
the
same
scheme
differently
and
so
instead
of
the
scheme
being
the
skeleton
that
keeps
guild
society
together
the
attempt
to
define
what
the
scheme
ought
to
be
would
be
under
guild
socialism
as
elsewhere
the
main
business
of
politics
if
we
could
allow
cole
his
scheme
of
functions
we
could
allow
him
almost
everything
unfortunately
he
has
inserted
in
his
premise
what
he
wishes
a
guild
society
to
deduce
footnote
i
have
dealt
with
cole
theory
rather
than
with
the
experience
of
soviet
russia
because
while
the
testimony
is
fragmentary
all
competent
observers
seem
to
agree
that
russia
in
does
not
illustrate
a
communist
state
in
working
order
russia
is
in
revolution
and
what
you
can
learn
from
russia
is
what
a
revolution
is
like
you
can
learn
very
little
about
what
a
communist
society
would
be
like
it
is
however
immensely
significant
that
first
as
practical
revolutionists
and
then
as
public
officials
the
russian
communists
have
relied
not
upon
the
spontaneous
democracy
of
the
russian
people
but
on
the
discipline
special
interest
and
the
noblesse
oblige
of
a
specialized
loyal
and
indoctrinated
members
of
the
communist
party
in
the
transition
on
which
no
time
limit
has
been
set
i
believe
the
cure
for
class
government
and
the
coercive
state
is
strictly
homeopathic
there
is
also
the
question
of
why
i
selected
cole
books
rather
than
the
much
more
closely
reasoned
constitution
for
the
socialist
commonwealth
of
great
britain
by
sidney
and
beatrice
webb
i
admire
that
book
very
much
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
convince
myself
that
it
is
not
an
intellectual
tour
de
force
cole
seems
to
me
far
more
authentically
in
the
spirit
of
the
socialist
movement
and
therefore
a
better
witness
chapter
xx
a
new
image
the
lesson
is
i
think
a
fairly
clear
one
in
the
absence
of
institutions
and
education
by
which
the
environment
is
so
successfully
reported
that
the
realities
of
public
life
stand
out
sharply
against
opinion
the
common
interests
very
largely
elude
public
opinion
entirely
and
can
be
managed
only
by
a
specialized
class
whose
personal
interests
reach
beyond
the
locality
this
class
is
irresponsible
for
it
acts
upon
information
that
is
not
common
property
in
situations
that
the
public
at
large
does
not
conceive
and
it
can
be
held
to
account
only
on
the
accomplished
fact
the
democratic
theory
by
failing
to
admit
that
opinions
are
not
sufficient
to
procure
good
government
is
involved
in
perpetual
conflict
between
theory
and
practice
according
to
the
theory
the
full
dignity
of
man
requires
that
his
will
should
be
as
cole
says
expressed
in
any
and
every
form
of
social
action
it
is
supposed
that
the
expression
of
their
will
is
the
consuming
passion
of
men
for
they
are
assumed
to
possess
by
instinct
the
art
of
government
but
as
a
matter
of
plain
experience
is
only
one
of
the
many
interests
of
a
human
personality
the
desire
to
be
the
master
of
one
own
destiny
is
a
strong
desire
but
it
has
to
adjust
itself
to
other
equally
strong
desires
such
as
the
desire
for
a
good
life
for
peace
for
relief
from
burdens
in
the
original
assumptions
of
democracy
it
was
held
that
the
expression
of
each
will
would
spontaneously
satisfy
not
only
his
desire
for
but
his
desire
for
a
good
life
because
the
instinct
to
express
one
self
in
a
good
life
was
innate
the
emphasis
therefore
has
always
been
on
the
mechanism
for
expressing
the
will
the
democratic
el
dorado
has
always
been
some
perfect
environment
and
some
perfect
system
of
voting
and
representation
where
the
innate
good
will
and
instinctive
statesmanship
of
every
man
could
be
translated
into
action
in
limited
areas
and
for
brief
periods
the
environment
has
been
so
favorable
that
is
to
say
so
isolated
and
so
rich
in
opportunity
that
the
theory
worked
well
enough
to
confirm
men
in
thinking
that
it
was
sound
for
all
time
and
everywhere
then
when
the
isolation
ended
and
society
became
complex
and
men
had
to
adjust
themselves
closely
to
one
another
the
democrat
spent
his
time
trying
to
devise
more
perfect
units
of
voting
in
the
hope
that
somehow
he
would
as
cole
says
get
the
mechanism
right
and
adjust
it
as
far
as
possible
to
social
wills
but
while
the
democratic
theorist
was
busy
at
this
he
was
far
away
from
the
actual
interests
of
human
nature
he
was
absorbed
by
one
interest
mankind
was
interested
in
all
kinds
of
other
things
in
order
in
its
rights
in
prosperity
in
sights
and
sounds
and
in
not
being
bored
in
so
far
as
spontaneous
democracy
does
not
satisfy
their
other
interests
it
seems
to
most
men
most
of
the
time
to
be
an
empty
thing
because
the
art
of
successful
is
not
instinctive
men
do
not
long
desire
for
its
own
sake
they
desire
it
for
the
sake
of
the
results
that
is
why
the
impulse
to
is
always
strongest
as
a
protest
against
bad
conditions
the
democratic
fallacy
has
been
its
preoccupation
with
the
origin
of
government
rather
than
with
the
processes
and
results
the
democrat
has
always
assumed
that
if
political
power
could
be
derived
in
the
right
way
it
would
be
beneficent
his
whole
attention
has
been
on
the
source
of
power
since
he
is
hypnotized
by
the
belief
that
the
great
thing
is
to
express
the
will
of
the
people
first
because
expression
is
the
highest
interest
of
man
and
second
because
the
will
is
instinctively
good
but
no
amount
of
regulation
at
the
source
of
a
river
will
completely
control
its
behavior
and
while
democrats
have
been
absorbed
in
trying
to
find
a
good
mechanism
for
originating
social
power
that
is
to
say
a
good
mechanism
of
voting
and
representation
they
neglected
almost
every
other
interest
of
men
for
no
matter
how
power
originates
the
crucial
interest
is
in
how
power
is
exercised
what
determines
the
quality
of
civilization
is
the
use
made
of
power
and
that
use
can
not
be
controlled
at
the
source
if
you
try
to
control
government
wholly
at
the
source
you
inevitably
make
all
the
vital
decisions
invisible
for
since
there
is
no
instinct
which
automatically
makes
political
decisions
that
produce
a
good
life
the
men
who
actually
exercise
power
not
only
fail
to
express
the
will
of
the
people
because
on
most
questions
no
will
exists
but
they
exercise
power
according
to
opinions
which
are
hidden
from
the
electorate
if
then
you
root
out
of
the
democratic
philosophy
the
whole
assumption
in
all
its
ramifications
that
government
is
instinctive
and
that
therefore
it
can
be
managed
by
opinions
what
becomes
of
the
democratic
faith
in
the
dignity
of
man
it
takes
a
fresh
lease
of
life
by
associating
itself
with
the
whole
personality
instead
of
with
a
meager
aspect
of
it
for
the
traditional
democrat
risked
the
dignity
of
man
on
one
very
precarious
assumption
that
he
would
exhibit
that
dignity
instinctively
in
wise
laws
and
good
government
voters
did
not
do
that
and
so
the
democrat
was
forever
being
made
to
look
a
little
silly
by
men
but
if
instead
of
hanging
human
dignity
on
the
one
assumption
about
you
insist
that
man
dignity
requires
a
standard
of
living
in
which
his
capacities
are
properly
exercised
the
whole
problem
changes
the
criteria
which
you
then
apply
to
government
are
whether
it
is
producing
a
certain
minimum
of
health
of
decent
housing
of
material
necessities
of
education
of
freedom
of
pleasures
of
beauty
not
simply
whether
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
these
things
it
vibrates
to
the
opinions
that
happen
to
be
floating
around
in
minds
in
the
degree
to
which
these
criteria
can
be
made
exact
and
objective
political
decision
which
is
inevitably
the
concern
of
comparatively
few
people
is
actually
brought
into
relation
with
the
interests
of
men
there
is
no
prospect
in
any
time
which
we
can
conceive
that
the
whole
invisible
environment
will
be
so
clear
to
all
men
that
they
will
spontaneously
arrive
at
sound
public
opinions
on
the
whole
business
of
government
and
even
if
there
were
a
prospect
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
many
of
us
would
wish
to
be
bothered
or
would
take
the
time
to
form
an
opinion
on
any
and
every
form
of
social
action
which
affects
us
the
only
prospect
which
is
not
visionary
is
that
each
of
us
in
his
own
sphere
will
act
more
and
more
on
a
realistic
picture
of
the
invisible
world
and
that
we
shall
develop
more
and
more
men
who
are
expert
in
keeping
these
pictures
realistic
outside
the
rather
narrow
range
of
our
own
possible
attention
social
control
depends
upon
devising
standards
of
living
and
methods
of
audit
by
which
the
acts
of
public
officials
and
industrial
directors
are
measured
we
can
not
ourselves
inspire
or
guide
all
these
acts
as
the
mystical
democrat
has
always
imagined
but
we
can
steadily
increase
our
real
control
over
these
acts
by
insisting
that
all
of
them
shall
be
plainly
recorded
and
their
results
objectively
measured
i
should
say
perhaps
that
we
can
progressively
hope
to
insist
for
the
working
out
of
such
standards

of
such
audits

the

the
idea
that
men
have

go

and
study
the
world
in
order
to
govern
it
has
played
a
very
minor
part
in
political
thought
it
could
figure
very
little
because
the
machinery
for
reporting
the
world
in
any
way
useful
to
government
made
comparatively
little
progress
from
the
time
of
aristotle
to
the
age
in
which
the
premises
of
democracy
were
established
therefore
if
you
had
asked
a
pioneer
democrat
where
the
information
was
to
come
from
on
which
the
will
of
the
people
was
to
be
based
he
would
have
been
puzzled
by
the
question
it
would
have
seemed
a
little
as
if
you
had
asked
him
where
his
life
or
his
soul
came
from
the
will
of
the
people
he
almost
always
assumed
exists
at
all
times
the
duty
of
political
science
was
to
work
out
the
inventions
of
the
ballot
and
representative
government
if
they
were
properly
worked
out
and
applied
under
the
right
conditions
such
as
exist
in
the
village
or

shop
the
mechanism
would
somehow
overcome
the
brevity
of
attention
which
aristotle
had
observed
and
the
narrowness
of
its
range
which
the
theory
of
a
community
tacitly
acknowledged
we
have
seen
how
even
at
this
late
date
the
guild
socialists
are
transfixed
by
the
notion
that
if
only
you
can
build
on
the
right
unit
of
voting
and
representation
an
intricate
cooperative
commonwealth
is
possible
convinced
that
the
wisdom
was
there
if
only
you
could
find

have
treated

supposing
that
no

are
we
to
believe
then
that
the
truth
is
generated
by
the
encounter
like
fire
by
rubbing
two
sticks
behind
this
classic
doctrine
of
liberty
which
american
democrats
embodied
in
their
bill
of
rights
there
are
in
fact
several
different
theories
of
the
origin
of
truth
one
is
a
faith
that
in
the
competition
of
opinions
the
truest
will
win
because
there
is
a
peculiar
strength
in
the
truth
this
is
probably
sound
if
you
allow
the
competition
to
extend
over
a
sufficiently
long
time
when
men
argue
in
this
vein
they
have
in
mind
the
verdict
of
history
and
they
think
specifically
of
heretics
persecuted
when
they
lived
canonized
after
they
were
dead
question
rests
also
on
a
belief
that
the
capacity
to
recognize
truth
is
inherent
in
all
men
and
that
truth
freely
put
in
circulation
will
win
acceptance
it
derives
no
less
from
the
experience
which
has
shown
that
men
are
not
likely
to
discover
truth
if
they
can
not
speak
it
except
under
the
eye
of
an
uncomprehending
policeman
no
one
can
possibly
overestimate
the
practical
value
of
these
civil
liberties
nor
the
importance
of
maintaining
them
when
they
are
in
jeopardy
the
human
spirit
is
in
jeopardy
and
should
there
come
a
time
when
they
have
to
be
curtailed
as
during
a
war
the
suppression
of
thought
is
a
risk
to
civilization
which
might
prevent
its
recovery
from
the
effects
of
war
if
the
hysterics
who
exploit
the
necessity
were
numerous
enough
to
carry
over
into
peace
the
taboos
of
war
fortunately
the
mass
of
men
is
too
tolerant
long
to
enjoy
the
professional
inquisitors
as
gradually
under
the
criticism
of
men
not
willing
to
be
terrorized
they
are
revealed
as
creatures
who
of
the
time
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
footnote
for
example
the
publications
of
the
lusk
committee
in
new
york
and
the
public
statements
and
prophecies
of
mitchell
palmer
who
was
of
the
united
states
during
the
period
of
president
wilson
illness
but
in
spite
of
its
fundamental
importance
civil
liberty
in
this
sense
does
not
guarantee
public
opinion
in
the
modern
world
for
it
always
assumes
either
that
truth
is
spontaneous
or
that
the
means
of
securing
truth
exist
when
there
is
no
external
interference
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
an
invisible
environment
the
assumption
is
false
the
truth
about
distant
or
complex
matters
is
not
and
the
machinery
for
assembling
information
is
technical
and
expensive
yet
political
science
and
especially
democratic
political
science
has
never
freed
itself
from
the
original
assumption
of
aristotle
politics
sufficiently
to
restate
the
premises
so
that
political
thought
might
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
of
how
to
make
the
invisible
world
visible
to
the
citizens
of
a
modern
state
so
deep
is
the
tradition
that
until
quite
recently
for
example
political
science
was
taught
in
our
colleges
as
if
newspapers
did
not
exist
i
am
not
referring
to
schools
of
journalism
for
they
are
trade
schools
intended
to
prepare
men
and
women
for
a
career
i
am
referring
to
political
science
as
expounded
to
future
business
men
lawyers
public
officials
and
citizens
at
large
in
that
science
a
study
of
the
press
and
the
sources
of
popular
information
found
no
place
it
is
a
curious
fact
to
anyone
not
immersed
in
the
routine
interests
of
political
science
it
is
almost
inexplicable
that
no
american
student
of
government
no
american
sociologist
has
ever
written
a
book
on
there
are
occasional
references
to
the
press
and
statements
that
it
is
not
or
that
it
ought
to
be
free
and
truthful
but
i
can
find
almost
nothing
else
and
this
disdain
of
the
professionals
finds
its
counterpart
in
public
opinions
universally
it
is
admitted
that
the
press
is
the
chief
means
of
contact
with
the
unseen
environment
and
practically
everywhere
it
is
assumed
that
the
press
should
do
spontaneously
for
us
what
primitive
democracy
imagined
each
of
us
could
do
spontaneously
for
himself
that
every
day
and
twice
a
day
it
will
present
us
with
a
true
picture
of
all
the
outer
world
in
which
we
are
interested
this
insistent
and
ancient
belief
that
truth
is
not
earned
but
inspired
revealed
supplied
gratis
comes
out
very
plainly
in
our
economic
prejudices
as
readers
of
newspapers
we
expect
the
newspaper
to
serve
us
with
truth
however
unprofitable
the
truth
may
be
for
this
difficult
and
often
dangerous
service
which
we
recognize
as
fundamental
we
expected
to
pay
until
recently
the
smallest
coin
turned
out
by
the
mint
we
have
accustomed
ourselves
now
to
paying
two
and
even
three
cents
on
weekdays
and
on
sundays
for
an
illustrated
encyclopedia
and
vaudeville
entertainment
attached
we
have
screwed
ourselves
up
to
paying
a
nickel
or
even
a
dime
nobody
thinks
for
a
moment
that
he
ought
to
pay
for
his
newspaper
he
expects
the
fountains
of
truth
to
bubble
but
he
enters
into
no
contract
legal
or
moral
involving
any
risk
cost
or
trouble
to
himself
he
will
pay
a
nominal
price
when
it
suits
him
will
stop
paying
whenever
it
suits
him
will
turn
to
another
paper
when
that
suits
him
somebody
has
said
quite
aptly
that
the
newspaper
editor
has
to
be
every
day
this
casual
and
relationship
between
readers
and
press
is
an
anomaly
of
our
civilization
there
is
nothing
else
quite
like
it
and
it
is
therefore
hard
to
compare
the
press
with
any
other
business
or
institution
it
is
not
a
business
pure
and
simple
partly
because
the
product
is
regularly
sold
below
cost
but
chiefly
because
the
community
applies
one
ethical
measure
to
the
press
and
another
to
trade
or
manufacture
ethically
a
newspaper
is
judged
as
if
it
were
a
church
or
a
school
but
if
you
try
to
compare
it
with
these
you
fail
the
taxpayer
pays
for
the
public
school
the
private
school
is
endowed
or
supported
by
tuition
fees
there
are
subsidies
and
collections
for
the
church
you
can
not
compare
journalism
with
law
medicine
or
engineering
for
in
every
one
of
these
professions
the
consumer
pays
for
the
service
a
free
press
if
you
judge
by
the
attitude
of
the
readers
means
newspapers
that
are
virtually
given
away
yet
the
critics
of
the
press
are
merely
voicing
the
moral
standards
of
the
community
when
they
expect
such
an
institution
to
live
on
the
same
plane
as
that
on
which
the
school
the
church
and
the
disinterested
professions
are
supposed
to
live
this
illustrates
again
the
concave
character
of
democracy
no
need
for
artificially
acquired
information
is
felt
to
exist
the
information
must
come
naturally
that
is
to
say
gratis
if
not
out
of
the
heart
of
the
citizen
then
gratis
out
of
the
newspaper
the
citizen
will
pay
for
his
telephone
his
railroad
rides
his
motor
car
his
entertainment
but
he
does
not
pay
openly
for
his
news
he
will
however
pay
handsomely
for
the
privilege
of
having
someone
read
about
him
he
will
pay
directly
to
advertise
and
he
will
pay
indirectly
for
the
advertisements
of
other
people
because
that
payment
being
concealed
in
the
price
of
commodities
is
part
of
an
invisible
environment
that
he
does
not
effectively
comprehend
it
would
be
regarded
as
an
outrage
to
have
to
pay
openly
the
price
of
a
good
ice
cream
soda
for
all
the
news
of
the
world
though
the
public
will
pay
that
and
more
when
it
buys
the
advertised
commodities
the
public
pays
for
the
press
but
only
when
the
payment
is
concealed
circulation
is
therefore
the
means
to
an
end
it
becomes
an
asset
only
when
it
can
be
sold
to
the
advertiser
who
buys
it
with
revenues
secured

indirect
taxation

the
kind
of
circulation
which
the
advertiser
will
buy
depends
on
what
he
has
to
sell
it
may
be
quality
or
mass
on
the
whole
there
is
no
sharp
dividing
line
for
in
respect
to
most
commodities
sold
by
advertising
the
customers
are
neither
the
small
class
of
the
very
rich
nor
the
very
poor
they
are
the
people
with
enough
surplus
over
bare
necessities
to
exercise
discretion
in
their
buying
the
paper
therefore
which
goes
into
the
homes
of
the
fairly
prosperous
is
by
and
large
the
one
which
offers
most
to
the
advertiser
it
may
also
go
into
the
homes
of
the
poor
but
except
for
certain
lines
of
goods
an
analytical
advertising
agent
does
not
rate
that
circulation
as
a
great
asset
unless
as
seems
to
be
the
case
with
certain
of
hearst
properties
the
circulation
is
enormous
a
newspaper
which
angers
those
whom
it
pays
best
to
reach
through
advertisements
is
a
bad
medium
for
an
advertiser
and
since
no
one
ever
claimed
that
advertising
was
philanthropy
advertisers
buy
space
in
those
publications
which
are
fairly
certain
to
reach
their
future
customers
one
need
not
spend
much
time
worrying
about
the
unreported
scandals
of
the
merchants
they
represent
nothing
really
significant
and
incidents
of
this
sort
are
less
common
than
many
critics
of
the
press
suppose
the
real
problem
is
that
the
readers
of
a
newspaper
unaccustomed
to
paying
the
cost
of
newsgathering
can
be
capitalized
only
by
turning
them
into
circulation
that
can
be
sold
to
manufacturers
and
merchants
and
those
whom
it
is
most
important
to
capitalize
are
those
who
have
the
most
money
to
spend
such
a
press
is
bound
to
respect
the
point
of
view
of
the
buying
public
it
is
for
this
buying
public
that
newspapers
are
edited
and
published
for
without
that
support
the
newspaper
can
not
live
a
newspaper
can
flout
an
advertiser
it
can
attack
a
powerful
banking
or
traction
interest
but
if
it
alienates
the
buying
public
it
loses
the
one
indispensable
asset
of
its
existence

mr
given
formerly

the
new
york
evening
sun
stated
in
that
out
of
over
two
thousand
three
hundred
dailies
published
in
the
united
states
there
were
about
one
hundred
and
printed
in
cities
having
over
one
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
these
constitute
the
press
for
general
news
they
are
the
key
papers
which
collect
the
news
dealing
with
great
events
and
even
the
people
who
do
not
read
any
one
of
the
one
hundred
and
depend
ultimately
upon
them
for
news
of
the
outer
world
for
they
make
up
the
great
press
associations
which
coöperate
in
the
exchange
of
news
each
is
therefore
not
only
the
informant
of
its
own
readers
but
it
is
the
local
reporter
for
the
newspapers
of
other
cities
the
rural
press
and
the
special
press
by
and
large
take
their
general
news
from
these
key
papers
and
among
these
there
are
some
very
much
richer
than
others
so
that
for
international
news
in
the
main
the
whole
press
of
the
nation
may
depend
upon
the
reports
of
the
press
associations
and
the
special
services
of
a
few
metropolitan
dailies
roughly
speaking
the
economic
support
for
general
news
gathering
is
in
the
price
paid
for
advertised
goods
by
the
fairly
prosperous
sections
of
cities
with
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
these
buying
publics
are
composed
of
the
members
of
families
who
depend
for
their
income
chiefly
on
trade
merchandising
the
direction
of
manufacture
and
finance
they
are
the
clientele
among
whom
it
pays
best
to
advertise
in
a
newspaper
they
wield
a
concentrated
purchasing
power
which
may
be
less
in
volume
than
the
aggregate
for
farmers
and
workingmen
but
within
the
radius
covered
by
a
daily
newspaper
they
are
the
quickest
assets
they
have
moreover
a
double
claim
to
attention
they
are
not
only
the
best
customers
for
the
advertiser
they
include
the
advertisers
therefore
the
impression
made
by
the
newspapers
on
this
public
matters
deeply
fortunately
this
public
is
not
unanimous
it
may
be
capitalistic
but
it
contains
divergent
views
on
what
capitalism
is
and
how
it
is
to
be
run
except
in
times
of
danger
this
respectable
opinion
is
sufficiently
divided
to
permit
of
considerable
differences
of
policy
these
would
be
greater
still
if
it
were
not
that
publishers
are
themselves
usually
members
of
these
urban
communities
and
honestly
see
the
world
through
the
lenses
of
their
associates
and
friends
they
are
engaged
in
a
speculative
business
footnote
sometimes
so
speculative
that
in
order
to
secure
credit
the
publisher
has
to
go
into
bondage
to
his
creditors
information
on
this
point
is
very
difficult
to
obtain
and
for
that
reason
its
general
importance
is
often
much
exaggerated
which
depends
on
the
general
condition
of
trade
and
more
peculiarly
on
a
circulation
based
not
on
a
marriage
contract
with
their
readers
but
on
free
love
the
object
of
every
publisher
is
therefore
to
turn
his
circulation
from
a
medley
of
news
stand
buyers
into
a
devoted
band
of
constant
readers
a
newspaper
that
can
really
depend
upon
the
loyalty
of
its
readers
is
as
independent
as
a
newspaper
can
be
given
the
economics
of
modern
journalism
footnote
it
is
an
axiom
in
newspaper
publishing
readers
more
independence
of
the
influence
of
advertisers
fewer
readers
and
more
dependence
on
the
advertiser
it
may
seem
like
a
contradiction
yet
it
is
the
truth
to
assert
the
greater
the
number
of
advertisers
the
less
influence
they
are
individually
able
to
exercise
with
the
publisher
adolph
ochs
a
body
of
readers
who
stay
by
it
through
thick
and
thin
is
a
power
greater
than
any
which
the
individual
advertiser
can
wield
and
a
power
great
enough
to
break
up
a
combination
of
advertisers
therefore
whenever
you
find
a
newspaper
betraying
its
readers
for
the
sake
of
an
advertiser
you
can
be
fairly
certain
either
that
the
publisher
sincerely
shares
the
views
of
the
advertiser
or
that
he
thinks
perhaps
mistakenly
he
can
not
count
upon
the
support
of
his
readers
if
he
openly
resists
dictation
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
readers
who
do
not
pay
in
cash
for
their
news
will
pay
for
it
in
loyalty
chapter
xxii
the
constant
reader
i
the
loyalty
of
the
buying
public
to
a
newspaper
is
not
stipulated
in
any
bond
in
almost
every
other
enterprise
the
person
who
expects
to
be
served
enters
into
an
agreement
that
controls
his
passing
whims
at
least
he
pays
for
what
he
obtains
in
the
publishing
of
periodicals
the
nearest
approach
to
an
agreement
for
a
definite
time
is
the
paid
subscription
and
that
is
not
i
believe
a
great
factor
in
the
economy
of
a
metropolitan
daily
the
reader
is
the
sole
and
the
daily
judge
of
his
loyalty
and
there
can
be
no
suit
against
him
for
breach
of
promise
or
nonsupport
though
everything
turns
on
the
constancy
of
the
reader
there
does
not
exist
even
a
vague
tradition
to
call
that
fact
to
the
reader
mind
his
constancy
depends
on
how
he
happens
to
feel
or
on
his
habits
and
these
depend
not
simply
on
the
quality
of
the
news
but
more
often
on
a
number
of
obscure
elements
that
in
our
casual
relation
to
the
press
we
hardly
take
the
trouble
to
make
conscious
the
most
important
of
these
is
that
each
of
us
tends
to
judge
a
newspaper
if
we
judge
it
at
all
by
its
treatment
of
that
part
of
the
news
in
which
we
feel
ourselves
involved
the
newspaper
deals
with
a
multitude
of
events
beyond
our
experience
but
it
deals
also
with
some
events
within
our
experience
and
by
its
handling
of
those
events
we
most
frequently
decide
to
like
it
or
dislike
it
to
trust
it
or
refuse
to
have
the
sheet
in
the
house
if
the
newspaper
gives
a
satisfactory
account
of
that
which
we
think
we
know
our
business
our
church
our
party
it
is
fairly
certain
to
be
immune
from
violent
criticism
by
us
what
better
criterion
does
the
man
at
the
breakfast
table
possess
than
that
the
newspaper
version
checks
up
with
his
own
opinion
therefore
most
men
tend
to
hold
the
newspaper
most
strictly
accountable
in
their
capacity
not
of
general
readers
but
of
special
pleaders
on
matters
of
their
own
experience
rarely
is
anyone
but
the
interested
party
able
to
test
the
accuracy
of
a
report
if
the
news
is
local
and
if
there
is
competition
the
editor
knows
that
he
will
probably
hear
from
the
man
who
thinks
his
portrait
unfair
and
inaccurate
but
if
the
news
is
not
local
the
corrective
diminishes
as
the
subject
matter
recedes
into
the
distance
the
only
people
who
can
correct
what
they
think
is
a
false
picture
of
themselves
printed
in
another
city
are
members
of
groups
well
enough
organized
to
hire
publicity
men
now
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
general
reader
of
a
newspaper
has
no
standing
in
law
if
he
thinks
he
is
being
misled
by
the
news
it
is
only
the
aggrieved
party
who
can
sue
for
slander
or
libel
and
he
has
to
prove
a
material
injury
to
himself
the
law
embodies
the
tradition
that
general
news
is
not
a
matter
of
common
concern
footnote
the
reader
will
not
mistake
this
as
a
plea
for
censorship
it
might
however
be
a
good
thing
if
there
were
competent
tribunals
preferably
not
official
ones
where
charges
of
untruthfulness
and
unfairness
in
the
general
news
could
be
sifted
liberty
and
the
news
pp
except
as
to
matter
which
is
vaguely
described
as
immoral
or
seditious
but
the
body
of
the
news
though
unchecked
as
a
whole
by
the
disinterested
reader
consists
of
items
about
which
some
readers
have
very
definite
preconceptions
those
items
are
the
data
of
his
judgment
and
news
which
men
read
without
this
personal
criterion
they
judge
by
some
other
standard
than
their
standard
of
accuracy
they
are
dealing
here
with
a
subject
matter
which
to
them
is
indistinguishable
from
fiction
the
canon
of
truth
can
not
be
applied
they
do
not
boggle
over
such
news
if
it
conforms
to
their
stereotypes
and
they
continue
to
read
it
if
it
interests
them

how
absent

to

there
are
newspapers
even
in
large
cities
edited
on
the
principle
that
the
readers
wish
to
read
about
themselves
the
theory
is
that
if
enough
people
see
their
own
names
in
the
paper
often
enough
can
read
about
their
weddings
funerals
sociables
foreign

their
fiftieth
birthdays
their
sixtieth
birthdays
their
silver
weddings
their

will

can
not

out
of

feeling
that
they
are

of

that
they
read
about
in

the
printed
diary
of
the

town
tends
to
be
the
printed
diary
of
a
smart
set
and
it
is
as
we
have
already
noted
the
dailies
of
the
cities
which
carry
the
burden
of
bringing
distant
news
to
the
private
citizen
but
it
is
not
primarily
their
political
and
social
news
which
holds
the
circulation
the
interest
in
that
is
intermittent
and
few
publishers
can
bank
on
it
alone
the
newspaper
therefore
takes
to
itself
a
variety
of
other
features
all
primarily
designed
to
hold
a
body
of
readers
together
who
so
far
as
big
news
is
concerned
are
not
able
to
be
critical
moreover
in
big
news
the
competition
in
any
one
community
is
not
very
serious
the
press
services
standardize
the
main
events
it
is
only
once
in
a
while
that
a
great
scoop
is
made
there
is
apparently
not
a
very
great
reading
public
for
such
massive
reporting
as
has
made
the
new
york
times
of
recent
years
indispensable
to
men
of
all
shades
of
opinion
in
order
to
differentiate
themselves
and
collect
a
steady
public
most
papers
have
to
go
outside
the
field
of
general
news
they
go
to
the
dazzling
levels
of
society
to
scandal
and
crime
to

thundering
partisanship
not
because
publishers
and
editors
are
interested
in
everything
but
news
but
because
they
have
to
find
some
way
of
holding
on
to
that
alleged
host
of
passionately
interested
readers
who
are
supposed
by
some
critics
of
the
press
to
be
clamoring
for
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
the
newspaper
editor
occupies
a
strange
position
his
enterprises
depend
upon
indirect
taxation
levied
by
his
advertisers
upon
his
readers
the
patronage
of
the
advertisers
depends
upon
the
skill
in
holding
together
an
effective
group
of
customers
these
customers
deliver
judgment
according
to
their
private
experiences
and
their
stereotyped
expectations
for
in
the
nature
of
things
they
have
no
independent
knowledge
of
most
news
they
read
if
the
judgment
is
not
unfavorable
the
editor
is
at
least
within
range
of
a
circulation
that
pays
but
in
order
to
secure
that
circulation
he
can
not
rely
wholly
upon
news
of
the
greater
environment
he
handles
that
as
interestingly
as
he
can
of
course
but
the
quality
of
the
general
news
especially
about
public
affairs
is
not
in
itself
sufficient
to
cause
very
large
numbers
of
readers
to
discriminate
among
the
dailies
this
somewhat
relationship
between
newspapers
and
public
information
is
reflected
in
the
salaries
of
newspaper
men
reporting
which
theoretically
constitutes
the
foundation
of
the
whole
institution
is
the
most
poorly
paid
branch
of
newspaper
work
and
is
the
least
regarded
by
and
large
able
men
go
into
it
only
by
necessity
or
for
experience
and
with
the
definite
intention
of
being
graduated
as
soon
as
possible
for
straight
reporting
is
not
a
career
that
offers
many
great
rewards
the
rewards
in
journalism
go
to
specialty
work
to
signed
correspondence
which
has
editorial
quality
to
executives
and
to
men
with
a
knack
and
flavor
of
their
own
this
is
due
no
doubt
to
what
economists
call
the
rent
of
ability
but
this
economic
principle
operates
with
such
peculiar
violence
in
journalism
that
newsgathering
does
not
attract
to
itself
anything
like
the
number
of
trained
and
able
men
which
its
public
importance
would
seem
to
demand
the
fact
that
the
able
men
take
up
straight
reporting
with
the
intention
of
leaving
it
as
soon
as
possible
is
i
think
the
chief
reason
why
it
has
never
developed
in
sufficient
measure
those
corporate
traditions
that
give
to
a
profession
prestige
and
a
jealous
for
it
is
these
corporate
traditions
which
engender
the
pride
of
craft
which
tend
to
raise
the
standards
of
admission
punish
breaches
of
the
code
and
give
men
the
strength
to
insist
upon
their
status
in
society
yet
all
this
does
not
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
for
while
the
economics
of
journalism
is
such
as
to
depress
the
value
of
news
reporting
it
is
i
am
certain
a
false
determinism
which
would
abandon
the
analysis
at
that
point
the
intrinsic
power
of
the
reporter
appears
to
be
so
great
the
number
of
very
able
men
who
pass
through
reporting
is
so
large
that
there
must
be
some
deeper
reason
why
comparatively
speaking
so
little
serious
effort
has
gone
into
raising
the
vocation
to
the
level

of
medicine

from

of

which
are
prostituted
by
a
more
or
less
conscious
conspiracy
of
the
rich
owners
of

if
this
theory
is
correct
then
a
certain
conclusion
follows
it
is
that
the
fair
body
of
truth
would
be
inviolate
in
a
press
not
in
any
way
connected
with
big
business
for
if
it
should
happen
that
a
press
not
controlled
by
and
not
even
friendly
with
big
business
somehow
failed
to
contain
the
fair
body
of
truth
something
would
be
wrong
with
theory
there
is
such
a
press
strange
to
say
in
proposing
a
remedy
sinclair
does
not
advise
his
readers
to
subscribe
to
the
nearest
radical
newspaper
why
not
if
the
troubles
of
american
journalism
go
back
to
the
brass
check
of
big
business
why
does
not
the
remedy
lie
in
reading
the
papers
that
do
not
in
any
remote
way
accept
the
brass
check
why
subsidize
a
national
news
with
a
large
board
of
directors
of
all
creeds
or
causes
to
print
a
paper
full
of
facts
regardless
of
what
is
injured
the

is
big

that
is
the
steel
trust
standard

and
the
like
why
not
urge
everybody
to
read
or
socialist
papers
sinclair
does
not
say
why
not
but
the
reason
is
simple
he
can
not
convince
anybody
not
even
himself
that
the
press
is
the
remedy
for
the
capitalist
press
he
ignores
the
press
both
in
his
theory
of
the
brass
check
and
in
his
constructive
proposal
but
if
you
are
diagnosing
american
journalism
you
can
not
ignore
it
if
what
you
care
about
is
the
fair
body
of
truth
you
do
not
commit
the
gross
logical
error
of
assembling
all
the
instances
of
unfairness
and
lying
you
can
find
in
one
set
of
newspapers
ignore
all
the
instances
you
could
easily
find
in
another
set
and
then
assign
as
the
cause
of
the
lying
the
one
supposedly
common
characteristic
of
the
press
to
which
you
have
confined
your
investigation
if
you
are
going
to
blame
capitalism
for
the
faults
of
the
press
you
are
compelled
to
prove
that
those
faults
do
not
exist
except
where
capitalism
controls
that
sinclair
can
not
do
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
while
in
his
diagnosis
he
traces
everything
to
capitalism
in
his
prescription
he
ignores
both
capitalism
and
one
would
have
supposed
that
the
inability
to
take
any
paper
as
a
model
of
truthfulness
and
competence
would
have
caused
sinclair
and
those
who
agree
with
him
to
look
somewhat
more
critically
at
their
assumptions
they
would
have
asked
themselves
for
example
where
is
the
fair
body
of
truth
that
big
business
prostitutes
but
business
does
not
seem
to
obtain
for
that
question
leads
i
believe
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
to
the
question
of
what
is
news
chapter
xxiii
the
nature
of
news
all
the
reporters
in
the
world
working
all
the
hours
of
the
day
could
not
witness
all
the
happenings
in
the
world
there
are
not
a
great
many
reporters
and
none
of
them
has
the
power
to
be
in
more
than
one
place
at
a
time
reporters
are
not
clairvoyant
they
do
not
gaze
into
a
crystal
ball
and
see
the
world
at
will
they
are
not
assisted
by
yet
the
range
of
subjects
these
comparatively
few
men
manage
to
cover
would
be
a
miracle
indeed
if
it
were
not
a
standardized
routine
newspapers
do
not
try
to
keep
an
eye
on
all

occur

john
smith
let
it
be

becomes
a
broker
for
ten
years
he
pursues
the
even
tenor
of
his
way
and
except
for
his
customers
and
his

no
one
gives
him
a
thought
to

is
as
if
he
were
not
but
in
the
eleventh
year
he
suffers
heavy
losses
and
at
last
his
resources
all
gone
summons
his
lawyer
and
arranges
for
the
making
of
an
assignment
the
lawyer
posts
off
to
the
county
clerk
office
and
a
clerk
there
makes
the
necessary
entries
in
the
official
docket
here
in

the

while
the
clerk
is
writing
smith

obituary
a

glances
over

and
a
few

later
the
reporters
know

troubles
and
are
as
well
informed
concerning
his
business
status
as
they
would

footnote
p
when
mr

says
that
the

his

he
does
not
mean
that
they
know

as
smith
knows
them
or
as
arnold
bennett
would
know
them
if
he
had
made
smith
the

the
newspapers
know
only
in
a
few
minutes
the
bald
facts
which
are
recorded
in
the
county

that
overt
act
uncovers
the
news
about
smith
whether
the
news
will
be
followed
up
or
not
is
another
matter
the
point
is
that
before
a
series
of
events
become
news
they
have
usually
to
make
themselves
noticeable
in
some
more
or
less
overt
act
generally
too
in
a
crudely
overt
act
smith
friends
may
have
known
for
years
that
he
was
taking
risks
rumors
may
even
have
reached
the
financial
editor
if
smith
friends
were
talkative
but
apart
from
the
fact
that
none
of
this
could
be
published
because
it
would
be
libel
there
is
in
these
rumors
nothing
definite
on
which
to
peg
a
story
something
definite
must
occur
that
has
unmistakable
form
it
may
be
the
act
of
going
into
bankruptcy
it
may
be
a
fire
a
collision
an
assault
a
riot
an
arrest
a
denunciation
the
introduction
of
a
bill
a
speech
a

citizen
an
editorial

a

the
proposal
to
build
a
bridge
there
must
be
a
manifestation
the
course
of
events
must
assume
a
certain
definable
shape
and
until
it
is
in
a
phase
where
some
aspect
is
an
accomplished
fact
news
does
not
separate
itself
from
the
ocean
of
possible
truth
naturally
there
is
room
for
wide
difference
of
opinion
as
to
when
events
have
a
shape
that
can
be
reported
a
good
journalist
will
find
news
oftener
than
a
hack
if
he
sees
a
building
with
a
dangerous
list
he
does
not
have
to
wait
until
it
falls
into
the
street
in
order
to
recognize
news
it
was
a
great
reporter
who
guessed
the
name
of
the
next
indian
viceroy
when
he
heard
that
lord
was
inquiring
about
climates
there
are
lucky
shots
but
the
number
of
men
who
can
make
them
is
small
usually
it
is
the
stereotyped
shape
assumed
by
an
event
at
an
obvious
place
that
uncovers
the
run
of
the
news
the
most
obvious
place
is
where
people
affairs
touch
public
authority
de
minimis
non
curat
lex
it
is
at
these
places
that
marriages
births
deaths
contracts
failures
arrivals
departures
lawsuits
disorders
epidemics
and
calamities
are
made
known
in
the
first
instance
therefore
the
news
is
not
a
mirror
of
social
conditions
but
the
report
of
an
aspect
that
has
obtruded
itself
the
news
does
not
tell
you
how
the
seed
is
germinating
in
the
ground
but
it
may
tell
you
when
the
first
sprout
breaks
through
the
surface
it
may
even
tell
you
what
somebody
says
is
happening
to
the
seed
under
ground
it
may
tell
you
that
the
sprout
did
not
come
up
at
the
time
it
was
expected
the
more
points
then
at
which
any
happening
can
be
fixed
objectified
measured
named
the
more
points
there
are
at
which
news
can
occur
so
if
some
day
a
legislature
having
exhausted
all
other
ways
of
improving
mankind
should
forbid
the
scoring
of
baseball
games
it
might
still
be
possible
to
play
some
sort
of
game
in
which
the
umpire
decided
according
to
his
own
sense
of
fair
play
how
long
the
game
should
last
when
each
team
should
go
to
bat
and
who
should
be
regarded
as
the
winner
if
that
game
were
reported
in
the
newspapers
it
would
consist
of
a
record
of
the
umpire
decisions
plus
the
reporter
impression
of
the
hoots
and
cheers
of
the
crowd
plus
at
best
a
vague
account
of
how
certain
men
who
had
no
specified
position
on
the
field
moved
around
for
a
few
hours
on
an
unmarked
piece
of
sod
the
more
you
try
to
imagine
the
logic
of
so
absurd
a
predicament
the
more
clear
it
becomes
that
for
the
purposes
of
newsgathering
let
alone
the
purposes
of
playing
the
game
it
is
impossible
to
do
much
without
an
apparatus
and
rules
for
naming
scoring
recording
because
that
machinery
is
far
from
perfect
the
umpire
life
is
often
a
distracted
one
many
crucial
plays
he
has
to
judge
by
eye
the
last
vestige
of
dispute
could
be
taken
out
of
the
game
as
it
has
been

the

that
there
is
a

direct

between
the

the
system
of

if
you
call
to
mind
the
topics
which
form
the
principal
indictment
by
reformers
against
the
press
you
find
they
are
subjects
in
which
the
newspaper
occupies
the
position
of
the
umpire
in
the

all
news

is
of

are
all
descriptions
of

of
sincerity
aspiration
motive
intention
of
mass
feeling
of
national
feeling
of
public

the
policies
of
foreign

is
much
news
about
what
is
going

happen
so
are
questions
turning
on
private

private

working

the

backward

conservatism
imperialism
radicalism
liberty

all
involve
data
that

spasmodically

the
data
may
be
hidden
because
of
a
censorship
or
a
tradition

they
may
not
exist
because
nobody
thinks
record
important
because
he
thinks
it
red
tape
or
because
nobody
has
yet
invented
an
objective
system
of
measurement
then
the
news
on
these
subjects
is
bound
to
be
debatable
when
it
is
not
wholly
neglected
the
events
which
are
not
scored
are
reported
either
as
personal
and
conventional
opinions
or
they
are
not

they
do
not

until
somebody
protests
or
somebody
investigates
or
somebody
publicly
in
the
etymological
meaning
of
the
word
makes
an
of

this
is
the
underlying
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
press
agent
the
enormous
discretion
as
to
what
facts
and
what
impressions
shall
be
reported
is
steadily
convincing
every
organized
group
of
people
that
whether
it
wishes
to
secure
publicity
or
to
avoid
it
the
exercise
of
discretion
can
not
be
left
to
the
reporter
it
is
safer
to
hire
a
press
agent
who
stands
between
the
group
and
the
newspapers
having
hired
him
the
temptation
to
exploit
his
strategic
position
is
very
great
shortly
before

says
frank

the
newspapers
of

york
took
a
census
of
the

agents
who
were

and
found
that
there
were
about
twelve
hundred
of
them
how
many
there
are
now
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
many
of
the
direct
channels
to
news
have
been
closed
and
the
information
for
the
public
is
first
filtered
through
publicity

the

were
reporting
the
simple
recovery
of
obvious
facts
the
press
agent
would
be
little
more
than
a
clerk
but
since
in
respect
to
most
of
the
big
topics
of
news
the
facts
are
not
simple
and
not
at
all
obvious
but
subject
to
choice
and
opinion
it
is
natural
that
everyone
should
wish
to
make
his
own
choice
of
facts
for
the
newspapers
to
print
the
publicity
man
does
that
and
in
doing
it
he
certainly
saves
the
reporter
much
trouble
by
presenting
him
a
clear
picture
of
a
situation
out
of
which
he
might
otherwise
make
neither
head
nor
tail
but
it
follows
that
the
picture
which
the
publicity
man
makes
for
the
reporter
is
the
one
he
wishes
the
public
to
see
he
is
censor
and
propagandist
responsible
only
to
his
employers
and
to
the
whole
truth
responsible
only
as
it
accords
with
the
conception
of
his
own
interests
the
development
of
the
publicity
man
is
a
clear
sign
that
the
facts
of
modern
life
do
not
spontaneously
take
a
shape
in
which
they
can
be
known
they
must
be
given
a
shape
by
somebody
and
since
in
the
daily
routine
reporters
can
not
give
a
shape
to
facts
and
since
there
is
little
disinterested
organization
of
intelligence
the
need
for
some
formulation
is
being
met
by
the
interested
parties
the
good
press
agent
understands
that
the
virtues
of
his
cause
are
not
news
unless
they
are
such
strange
virtues
that
they
jut
right
out
of
the
routine
of
life
this
is
not
because
the
newspapers
do
not
like
virtue
but
because
it
is
not
worth
while
to
say
that
nothing
has
happened
when
nobody
expected
anything
to
happen
so
if
the
publicity
man
wishes
free
publicity
he
has
speaking
quite
accurately
to
start
something
he
arranges
a
stunt
obstructs
the
traffic
teases
the
police
somehow
manages
to
entangle
his
client
or
his
cause
with
an
event
that
is
already
news
the
suffragists
knew
this
did
not
particularly
enjoy
the
knowledge
but
acted
on
it
and
kept
suffrage
in
the
news
long
after
the
arguments
pro
and
con
were
straw
in
their
mouths
and
people
were
about
to
settle
down
to
thinking
of
the

the

the
causes

are

let
us
suppose

up

conception
of

the

may
be

below
the
theoretical
standard

may
be

wretched

conditions
may

the

babe
ruth
is
an
exceptional
man
newspapers
can
not
time
all
motorists
they
have
to
take
their
news
about
speeding
from
the
police
the
bad
conditions
as
such
are
not
news
because
in
all
but
exceptional
cases
journalism
is
not
a
first
hand
report
of
the
raw
material
it
is
a
report
of
that
material
after
it
has
been
stylized
thus
bad
conditions
might
become
news
if
the
board
of
health
reported
an
unusually
high
death
rate
in
an
industrial
area
failing
an
intervention
of
this
sort
the
facts
do
not
become
news
until
the
workers
organize
and
make
a
demand
upon
their
employers
even
then
if
an
easy
settlement
is
certain
the
news
value
is
low
whether
or
not
the
conditions
themselves
are
remedied
in
the
settlement
but
if
industrial
relations
collapse
into
a
strike
or
lockout
the
news
value
increases
if
the
stoppage
involves
a
service
on
which
the
readers
of
the
newspapers
immediately
depend
or
if
it
involves
a
breach
of
order
the
news
value
is
still
greater
the
underlying
trouble
appears
in
the
news
through
certain
easily
recognizable
symptoms
a
demand
a
strike
disorder
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
worker
or
of
the
disinterested
seeker
of
justice
the
demand
the
strike
and
the
disorder
are
merely
incidents
in
a
process
that
for
them
is
richly
complicated
but
since
all
the
immediate
realities
lie
outside
the
direct
experience
both
of
the
reporter
and
of
the
special
public
by
which
most
newspapers
are
supported
they
have
normally
to
wait
for
a
signal
in
the
shape
of
an
overt
act
when
that
signal
comes
say
through
a
walkout
of
the
men
or
a
summons
for
the
police
it
calls
into
play
the
stereotypes
people
have
about
strikes
and
disorders
the
unseen
struggle
has
none
of
its
own
flavor
it
is
noted
abstractly
and
that
abstraction
is
then
animated
by
the
immediate
experience
of
the
reader
and
reporter
obviously
this
is
a
very
different
experience
from
that
which
the
strikers
have
they
feel
let
us
say
the
temper
of
the
foreman
the
monotony
of
the
machine
the
depressingly
bad
air
the
drudgery
of
their
wives
the
stunting
of
their
children
the
dinginess
of
their
tenements
the
slogans
of
the
strike
are
invested
with
these
feelings
but
the
reporter
and
reader
see
at
first
only
a
strike
and
some
catchwords
they
invest
these
with
their
feelings
their
feelings
may
be
that
their
jobs
are
insecure
because
the
strikers
are
stopping
goods
they
need
in
their
work
that
there
will
be
shortage
and
higher
prices
that
it
is
all
devilishly
inconvenient
these
too
are
realities
and
when
they
give
color
to
the
abstract
news
that
a
strike
has
been
called
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
the
workers
are
at
a
disadvantage
it
is
in
the
nature
that
is
to
say
of
the
existing
system
of
industrial
relations
that
news
arising
from
grievances
or
hopes
by
workers
should
almost
invariably
be
uncovered
by
an
overt
attack
on
production
you
have
therefore
the
circumstances
in
all
their
sprawling
complexity
the
overt
act
which
signalizes
them
the
stereotyped
bulletin
which
publishes
the
signal
and
the
meaning
that
the
reader
himself
injects
after
he
has
derived
that
meaning
from
the
experience
which
directly
affects
him
now
the
reader
experience
of
a
strike
may
be
very
important
indeed
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
central
trouble
which
caused
the
strike
it
is
eccentric
yet
this
eccentric
meaning
is
automatically
the
most
interesting
footnote
ch
xi
the
enlisting
of
interest
to
enter
imaginatively
into
the
central
issues
is
for
the
reader
to
step
out
of
himself
and
into
very
different
lives
it
follows
that
in
the
reporting
of
strikes
the
easiest
way
is
to
let
the
news
be
uncovered
by
the
overt
act
and
to
describe
the
event
as
the
story
of
interference
with
the
reader
life
that
is
where
his
attention
is
first
aroused
and
his
interest
most
easily
enlisted
a
great
deal
i
think
myself
the
crucial
part
of
what
looks
to
the
worker
and
the
reformer
as
deliberate
misrepresentation
on
the
part
of
newspapers
is
the
direct
outcome
of
a
practical
difficulty
in
uncovering
the
news
and
the
emotional
difficulty
of
making
distant
facts
interesting
unless
as
emerson
says
we
can
perceive
them
to
be
only
a
new
version
of
our
familiar
experience
and
can
set
about
translating
them
at
once
into
our
parallel
facts
footnote
from
his
essay
entitled
and
the
quotation
occurs
in
a
passage
cited
on
page
of
professor
brown
if
you
study
the
way
many
a
strike
is
reported
in
the
press
you
will
find
very
often
that
the
issues
are
rarely
in
the
headlines
barely
in
the
leading
paragraphs
and
sometimes
not
even
mentioned
anywhere
a
labor
dispute
in
another
city
has
to
be
very
important
before
the
news
account
contains
any
definite
information
as
to
what
is
in
dispute
the
routine
of
the
news
works
that
way
with
modifications
it
works
that
way
in
regard
to
political
issues
and
international
news
as
well
the
news
is
an
account
of
the
overt
phases
that
are
interesting
and
the
pressure
on
the
newspaper
to
adhere
to
this
routine
comes
from
many
sides
it
comes
from
the
economy
of
noting
only
the
stereotyped
phase
of
a
situation
it
comes
from
the
difficulty
of
finding
journalists
who
can
see
what
they
have
not
learned
to
see
it
comes
from
the
almost
unavoidable
difficulty
of
finding
sufficient
space
in
which
even
the
best
journalist
can
make
plausible
an
unconventional
view
it
comes
from
the
economic
necessity
of
interesting
the
reader
quickly
and
the
economic
risk
involved
in
not
interesting
him
at
all
or
of
offending
him
by
unexpected
news
insufficiently
or
clumsily
described
all
these
difficulties
combined
make
for
uncertainty
in
the
editor
when
there
are
dangerous
issues
at
stake
and
cause
him
naturally
to
prefer
the
indisputable
fact
and
a
treatment
more
readily
adapted
to
the
reader
interest
the
indisputable
fact
and
the
easy
interest
are
the
strike
itself
and
the
reader
inconvenience
all
the
subtler
and
deeper
truths
are
in
the
present
organization
of
industry
very
unreliable
truths
they
involve
judgments
about
standards
of
living
productivity
human
rights
that
are
endlessly
debatable
in
the
absence
of
exact
record
and
quantitative
analysis
and
as
long
as
these
do
not
exist
in
industry
the
run
of
news
about
it
will
tend
as
emerson
said
quoting
from
isocrates
to
make
of
moles
mountains
and

there
is
no

procedure
in
industry
and
no

sifting

the

fact

sensational
to
the

is
the
fact
that
almost

largely

even

that
arose
from
the
assertion
rather
than
the
reasons
which
led
to
it
the
reasons
are
intangible
the
editor
deals
with
these
bulletins
he
sits
in
his
office
reads
them
rarely
does
he
see
any
large
portion
of
the
events
themselves
he
must
as
we
have
seen
woo
at
least
a
section
of
his
readers
every
day
because
they
will
leave
him
without
mercy
if
a
rival
paper
happens
to
hit
their
fancy
he
works
under
enormous
pressure
for
the
competition
of
newspapers
is
often
a
matter
of
minutes
every
bulletin
requires
a
swift
but
complicated
judgment
it
must
be
understood
put
in
relation
to
other
bulletins
also
understood
and
played
up
or
played
down
according
to
its
probable
interest
for
the
public
as
the
editor
conceives
it
without
standardization
without
stereotypes
without
routine
judgments
without
a
fairly
ruthless
disregard
of
subtlety
the
editor
would
soon
die
of
excitement
the
final
page
is
of
a
definite
size
must
be
ready
at
a
precise
moment
there
can
be
only
a
certain
number
of
captions
on
the
items
and
in
each
caption
there
must
be
a
definite
number
of
letters
always
there
is
the
precarious
urgency
of
the
buying
public
the
law
of
libel
and
the
possibility
of
endless
trouble
the
thing
could
not
be
managed
at
all
without
systematization
for
in
a
standardized
product
there
is
economy
of
time
and
effort
as
well
as
a
partial
guarantee
against
failure
it
is
here
that
newspapers
influence
each
other
most
deeply
thus
when
the
war
broke
out
the
american
newspapers
were
confronted
with
a
subject
about
which
they
had
no
previous
experience
certain
dailies
rich
enough
to
pay
cable
tolls
took
the
lead
in
securing
news
and
the
way
that
news
was
presented
became
a
model
for
the
whole
press
but
where
did
that
model
come
from
it
came
from
the
english
press
not
because
northcliffe
owned
american
newspapers
but
because
at
first
it
was
easier
to
buy
english
correspondence
and
because
later
it
was
easier
for
american
journalists
to
read
english
newspapers
than
it
was
for
them
to
read
any
others
london
was
the
cable
and
news
center
and
it
was
there
that
a
certain
technic
for
reporting
the
war
was
evolved
something
similar
occurred
in
the
reporting
of
the
russian
revolution
in
that
instance
access
to
russia
was
closed
by
military
censorship
both
russian
and
allied
and
closed
still
more
effectively
by
the
difficulties
of
the
russian
language
but
above
all
it
was
closed
to
effective
news
reporting
by
the
fact
that
the
hardest
thing
to
report
is
chaos
even
though
it
is
an
evolving
chaos
this
put
the
formulating
of
russian
news
at
its
source
in
helsingfors
stockholm
geneva
paris
and
london
into
the
hands
of
censors
and
propagandists
they
were
for
a
long
time
subject
to
no
check
of
any
kind
until
they
had
made
themselves
ridiculous
they
created
let
us
admit
out
of
some
genuine
aspects
of
the
huge
russian
maelstrom
a
set
of
stereotypes
so
evocative
of
hate
and
fear
that
the
very
best
instinct
of
journalism
its
desire
to
go
and
see

was

every

which
you

is
a

not
entirely
a
matter
of
the

it

his
judgment
as
to
what
will
absorb
the
half
hour
attention
a
certain
set
of
readers
will
give
to
his
newspaper
now
the
problem
of
securing
attention
is
by
no
means
equivalent
to
displaying
the
news
in
the
perspective
laid
down
by
religious
teaching
or
by
some
form
of
ethical
culture
it
is
a
problem
of
provoking
feeling
in
the
reader
of
inducing
him
to
feel
a
sense
of
personal
identification
with
the
stories
he
is
reading
news
which
does
not
offer
this
opportunity
to
introduce
oneself
into
the
struggle
which
it
depicts
can
not
appeal
to
a
wide
audience
the
audience
must
participate
in
the
news
much
as
it
participates
in
the
drama
by
personal
identification
just
as
everyone
holds
his
breath
when
the
heroine
is
in
danger
as
he
helps
babe
ruth
swing
his
bat
so
in
subtler
form
the
reader
enters
into
the
news
in
order
that
he
shall
enter
he
must
find
a
familiar
foothold
in
the
story
and
this
is
supplied
to
him
by
the
use
of
stereotypes
they
tell
him
that
if
an
association
of
plumbers
is
called
a
combine
it
is
appropriate
to
develop
his
hostility
if
it
is
called
a
group
of
leading

men
the
cue
is
for
a
favorable
reaction
it
is
in
a
combination
of
these
elements
that
the
power
to
create
opinion
resides
editorials
reinforce
sometimes
in
a
situation
that
on
the
news
pages
is
too
confusing
to
permit
of
identification
they
give
the

a

by

of
which

a

he
must
have

as

of

he
will
soon

opinion
on
it
it
will
be
difficult
to
make
him
think
but
if
he
does
think
he
can
not
rest
in
a
negative
he
will
come
to
some
decision
and
on
any
ordinary
topic
of
course
it
is
so
a
grocer
has
a
full
creed
as
to
foreign
policy
a
young
lady
a
complete
theory
of
the
sacraments
as
to
which
neither
has
any
doubt
whatever
yet
that
same
grocer
will
have
many
doubts
about
his
groceries
and
that
young
lady
marvelously
certain
about
the
sacraments
may
have
all
kinds
of
doubts
as
to
whether
to
marry
the
grocer
and
if
not
whether
it
is
proper
to
accept
his
attentions
the
ability
to
rest
in
the
negative
implies
either
a
lack
of
interest
in
the
result
or
a
vivid
sense
of
competing
alternatives
in
the
case
of
foreign
policy
or
the
sacraments
the
interest
in
the
results
is
intense
while
means
for
checking
the
opinion
are
poor
this
is
the
plight
of
the
reader
of
the
general
news
if
he
is
to
read
it
at
all
he
must
be
interested
that
is
to
say
he
must
enter
into
the
situation
and
care
about
the
outcome
but
if
he
does
that
he
can
not
rest
in
a
negative
and
unless
independent
means
of
checking
the
lead
given
him
by
his
newspaper
exists
the
very
fact
that
he
is
interested
may
make
it
difficult
to
arrive
at
that
balance
of
opinions
which
may
most
nearly
approximate
the
truth
the
more
passionately
involved
he
becomes
the
more
he
will
tend
to
resent
not
only
a
different
view
but
a
disturbing
bit
of
news
that
is
why
many
a
newspaper
finds
that
having
honestly
evoked
the
partisanship
of
its
readers
it
can
not
easily
supposing
the
editor
believes
the
facts
warrant
it
change
position
if
a
change
is
necessary
the
transition
has
to
be
managed
with
the
utmost
skill
and
delicacy
usually
a
newspaper
will
not
attempt
so
hazardous
a
performance
it
is
easier
and
safer
to
have
the
news
of
that
subject
taper
off
and
disappear

chapter
xxiv
news
truth
and
a
conclusion
as
we
begin
to
make
more
and
more
exact
studies
of
the
press
much
will
depend
upon
the
hypothesis
we
hold
if
we
assume
with
sinclair
and
most
of
his
opponents
that
news
and
truth
are
two
words
for
the
same
thing
we
shall
i
believe
arrive
nowhere
we
shall
prove
that
on
this
point
the
newspaper
lied
we
shall
prove
that
on
that
point
sinclair
account
lied
we
shall
demonstrate
that
sinclair
lied
when
he
said
that
somebody
lied
and
that
somebody
lied
when
he
said
sinclair
lied
we
shall
vent
our
feelings
but
we
shall
vent
them
into
air
the
hypothesis
which
seems
to
me
the
most
fertile
is
that
news
and
truth
are
not
the
same
thing
and
must
be
clearly
distinguished
footnote
when
i
wrote
and
the
news
i
did
not
understand
this
distinction
clearly
enough
to
state
it
but
ff
the
function
of
news
is
to
signalize
an
event
the
function
of
truth
is
to
bring
to
light
the
hidden
facts
to
set
them
into
relation
with
each
other
and
make
a
picture
of
reality
on
which
men
can
act
only
at
those
points
where
social
conditions
take
recognizable
and
measurable
shape
do
the
body
of
truth
and
the
body
of
news
coincide
that
is
a
comparatively
small
part
of
the
whole
field
of
human
interest
in
this
sector
and
only
in
this
sector
the
tests
of
the
news
are
sufficiently
exact
to
make
the
charges
of
perversion
or
suppression
more
than
a
partisan
judgment
there
is
no
defense
no
extenuation
no
excuse
whatever
for
stating
six
times
that
lenin
is
dead
when
the
only
information
the
paper
possesses
is
a
report
that
he
is
dead
from
a
source
repeatedly
shown
to
be
unreliable
the
news
in
that
instance
is
not
lenin
dead
but
helsingfors
says
lenin
is
dead
and
a
newspaper
can
be
asked
to
take
the
responsibility
of
not
making
lenin
more
dead
than
the
source
of
the
news
is
reliable
if
there
is
one
subject
on
which
editors
are
most
responsible
it
is
in
their
judgment
of
the
reliability
of
the
source
but
when
it
comes
to
dealing
for
example
with
stories
of
what
the
russian
people
want
no
such
test
exists
the
absence
of
these
exact
tests
accounts
i
think
for
the
character
of
the
profession
as
no
other
explanation
does
there
is
a
very
small
body
of
exact
knowledge
which
it
requires
no
outstanding
ability
or
training
to
deal
with
the
rest
is
in
the
journalist
own
discretion
once
he
departs
from
the
region
where
it
is
definitely
recorded
at
the
county
clerk
office
that
john
smith
has
gone
into
bankruptcy
all
fixed
standards
disappear
the
story
of
why
john
smith
failed
his
human
frailties
the
analysis
of
the
economic
conditions
on
which
he
was
shipwrecked
all
of
this
can
be
told
in
a
hundred
different
ways
there
is
no
discipline
in
applied
psychology
as
there
is
a
discipline
in
medicine
engineering
or
even
law
which
has
authority
to
direct
the
journalist
mind
when
he
passes
from
the
news
to
the
vague
realm
of
truth
there
are
no
canons
to
direct
his
own
mind
and
no
canons
that
coerce
the
reader
judgment
or
the
publisher
his
version
of
the
truth
is
only
his
version
how
can
he
demonstrate
the
truth
as
he
sees
it
he
can
not
demonstrate
it
any
more
than
sinclair
lewis
can
demonstrate
that
he
has
told
the
whole
truth
about
main
street
and
the
more
he
understands
his
own
weaknesses
the
more
ready
he
is
to
admit
that
where
there
is
no
objective
test
his
own
opinion
is
in
some
vital
measure
constructed
out
of
his
own
stereotypes
according
to
his
own
code
and
by
the
urgency
of
his
own
interest
he
knows
that
he
is
seeing
the
world
through
subjective
lenses
he
can
not
deny
that
he
too
is
as
shelley
remarked
a
dome
of
glass
which
stains
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
and
by
this
knowledge
his
assurance
is
tempered
he
may
have
all
kinds
of
moral
courage
and
sometimes
has
but
he
lacks
that
sustaining
conviction
of
a
certain
technic
which
finally
freed
the
physical
sciences
from
theological
control
it
was
the
gradual
development
of
an
irrefragable
method
that
gave
the
physicist
his
intellectual
freedom
as
against
all
the
powers
of
the
world
his
proofs
were
so
clear
his
evidence
so
sharply
superior
to
tradition
that
he
broke
away
finally
from
all
control
but
the
journalist
has
no
such
support
in
his
own
conscience
or
in
fact
the
control
exercised
over
him
by
the
opinions
of
his
employers
and
his
readers
is
not
the
control
of
truth
by
prejudice
but
of
one
opinion
by
another
opinion
that
it
is
not
demonstrably
less
true
between
judge
gary
assertion
that
the
unions
will
destroy
american
institutions
and
gomper
assertion
that
they
are
agencies
of
the
rights
of
man
the
choice
has
in
large
measure
to
be
governed
by
the
will
to
believe
the
task
of
deflating
these
controversies
and
reducing
them
to
a
point
where
they
can
be
reported
as
news
is
not
a
task
which
the
reporter
can
perform
it
is
possible
and
necessary
for
journalists
to
bring
home
to
people
the
uncertain
character
of
the
truth
on
which
their
opinions
are
founded
and
by
criticism
and
agitation
to
prod
social
science
into
making
more
usable
formulations
of
social
facts
and
to
prod
statesmen
into
establishing
more
visible
institutions
the
press
in
other
words
can
fight
for
the
extension
of
reportable
truth
but
as
social
truth
is
organized
the
press
is
not
constituted
to
furnish
from
one
edition
to
the
next
the
amount
of
knowledge
which
the
democratic
theory
of
public
opinion
demands
this
is
not
due
to
the
brass
check
as
the
quality
of
news
in
radical
papers
shows
but
to
the
fact
that
the
press
deals
with
a
society
in
which
the
governing
forces
are
so
imperfectly
recorded
the
theory
that
the
press
can
itself
record
those
forces
is
false
it
can
normally
record
only
what
has
been
recorded
for
it
by
the
working
of
institutions
everything
else
is
argument
and
opinion
and
fluctuates
with
the
vicissitudes
the
and
the
courage
of
the
human
mind
if
the
press
is
not
so
universally
wicked
nor
so
deeply
conspiring
as
sinclair
would
have
us
believe
it
is
very
much
more
frail
than
the
democratic
theory
has
as
yet
admitted
it
is
too
frail
to
carry
the
whole
burden
of
popular
sovereignty
to
supply
spontaneously
the
truth
which
democrats
hoped
was
inborn
and
when
we
expect
it
to
supply
such
a
body
of
truth
we
employ
a
misleading
standard
of
judgment
we
misunderstand
the
limited
nature
of
news
the
illimitable
complexity
of
society
we
overestimate
our
own
endurance
public
spirit
and
competence
we
suppose
an
appetite
for
uninteresting
truths
which
is
not
discovered
by
any
honest
analysis
of
our
own
tastes
if
the
newspapers
then
are
to
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
translating
the
whole
public
life
of
mankind
so
that
every
adult
can
arrive
at
an
opinion
on
every
moot
topic
they
fail
they
are
bound
to
fail
in
any
future
one
can
conceive
they
will
continue
to
fail
it
is
not
possible
to
assume
that
a
world
carried
on
by
division
of
labor
and
distribution
of
authority
can
be
governed
by
universal
opinions
in
the
whole
population
unconsciously
the
theory
sets
up
the
single
reader
as
theoretically
omnicompetent
and
puts
upon
the
press
the
burden
of
accomplishing
whatever
representative
government
industrial
organization
and
diplomacy
have
failed
to
accomplish
acting
upon

the

knowledge
have
become
a
bundle
of
problems
which
the
population
as
a
whole
reading
the
press
as
a
whole
is
supposed
to
solve
the
press
in
other
words
has
come
to
be
regarded
as
an
organ
of
direct
democracy
charged
on
a
much
wider
scale
and
from
day
to
day
with
the
function
often
attributed
to
the
initiative
referendum
and
recall
the
court
of
public
opinion
open
day
and
night
is
to
lay
down
the
law
for
everything
all
the
time
it
is
not
workable
and
when
you
consider
the
nature
of
news
it
is
not
even
thinkable
for
the
news
as
we
have
seen
is
precise
in
proportion
to
the
precision
with
which
the
event
is
recorded
unless
the
event
is
capable
of
being
named
measured
given
shape
made
specific
it
either
fails
to
take
on
the
character
of
news
or
it
is
subject
to
the
accidents
and
prejudices
of
observation
therefore
on
the
whole
the
quality
of
the
news
about
modern
society
is
an
index
of
its
social
organization
the
better
the
institutions
the
more
all
interests
concerned
are
formally
represented
the
more
issues
are
disentangled
the
more
objective
criteria
are
introduced
the
more
perfectly
an
affair
can
be
presented
as
news
at
its
best
the
press
is
a
servant
and
guardian
of
institutions
at
its
worst
it
is
a
means
by
which
a
few
exploit
social
disorganization
to
their
own
ends
in
the
degree
to
which
institutions
fail
to
function
the
unscrupulous
journalist
can
fish
in
troubled
waters
and
the
conscientious
one
must
gamble
with
uncertainties
the
press
is
no
substitute
for
institutions
it
is
like
the
beam
of
a
searchlight
that
moves
restlessly
about
bringing
one
episode
and
then
another
out
of
darkness
into
vision
men
can
not
do
the
work
of
the
world
by
this
light
alone
they
can
not
govern
society
by
episodes
incidents
and
eruptions
it
is
only
when
they
work
by
a
steady
light
of
their
own
that
the
press
when
it
is
turned
upon
them
reveals
a
situation
intelligible
enough
for
a
popular
decision
the
trouble
lies
deeper
than
the
press
and
so
does
the
remedy
it
lies
in
social
organization
based
on
a
system
of
analysis
and
record
and
in
all
the
corollaries
of
that
principle
in
the
abandonment
of
the
theory
of
the
omnicompetent
citizen
in
the
decentralization
of
decision
in
the
coordination
of
decision
by
comparable
record
and
analysis
if
at
the
centers
of
management
there
is
a
running
audit
which
makes
work
intelligible
to
those
who
do
it
and
those
who
superintend
it
issues
when
they
arise
are
not
the
mere
collisions
of
the
blind
then
too
the
news
is
uncovered
for
the
press
by
a
system
of
intelligence
that
is
also
a
check
upon
the
press
that
is
the
radical
way
for
the
troubles
of
the
press
like
the
troubles
of
representative
government
be
it
territorial
or
functional
like
the
troubles
of
industry
be
it
capitalist
cooperative
or
communist
go
back
to
a
common
source
to
the
failure
of
people
to
transcend
their
casual
experience
and
their
prejudice
by
inventing
creating
and
organizing
a
machinery
of
knowledge
it
is
because
they
are
compelled
to
act
without
a
reliable
picture
of
the
world
that
governments
schools
newspapers
and
churches
make
such
small
headway
against
the
more
obvious
failings
of
democracy
against
violent
prejudice
apathy
preference
for
the
curious
trivial
as
against
the
dull
important
and
the
hunger
for
sideshows
and
three
legged
calves
this
is
the
primary
defect
of
popular
government
a
defect
inherent
in
its
traditions
and
all
its
other
defects
can
i
believe
be
traced
to
this

bureaus

they

interesting
public

are
built
up
instead
of

break
down
the

break
through
the

offer
men
a

of
facts
which
is
unfamiliar
and
to
them
impersonal
when
this
is
not
painful
it
is
dull
and
those
to
whom
it
is
painful
the
trading
politician
and
the
partisan
who
has
much
to
conceal
often
exploit
the
dullness
that
the
public
feels
in
order
to
remove
the
pain
that
they
feel
yet
every
complicated
community
has
sought
the
assistance
of
special
men
of
augurs
priests
elders
our
own
democracy
based
though
it
was
on
a
theory
of
universal
competence
sought
lawyers
to
manage
its
government
and
to
help
manage
its
industry
it
was
recognized
that
the
specially
trained
man
was
in
some
dim
way
oriented
to
a
wider
system
of
truth
than
that
which
arises
spontaneously
in
the
mind
but
experience
has
shown
that
the
traditional
lawyer
equipment
was
not
enough
assistance
the
great
society
had
grown
furiously
and
to
colossal
dimensions
by
the
application
of
technical
knowledge
it
was
made
by
engineers
who
had
learned
to
use
exact
measurements
and
quantitative
analysis
it
could
not
be
governed
men
began
to
discover
by
men
who
thought
deductively
about
rights
and
wrongs
it
could
be
brought
under
human
control
only
by
the
technic
which
had
created
it
gradually
then
the
more
enlightened
directing
minds
have
called
in
experts
who
were
trained
or
had
trained
themselves
to
make
parts
of
this
great
society
intelligible
to
those
who
manage
it
these
men
are
known
by
all
kinds
of
names
as
statisticians
accountants
auditors
industrial
counsellors
engineers
of
many
species
scientific
managers
personnel
administrators
research
men
scientists
and
sometimes
just
as
plain
private
secretaries
they
have
brought
with
them
each
a
jargon
of
his
own
as
well
as
filing
cabinets
card
catalogues
graphs
contraptions
and
above
all
the
perfectly
sound
ideal
of
an
executive
who
sits
before
a
desk
one
sheet
of
typewritten
paper
before
him
and
decides
on
matters
of
policy
presented
in
a
form
ready
for
his
rejection
or
approval
this
whole
development
has
been
the
work
not
so
much
of
a
spontaneous
creative
evolution
as
of
blind
natural
selection
the
statesman
the
executive
the
party
leader
the
head
of
a
voluntary
association
found
that
if
he
had
to
discuss
two
dozen
different
subjects
in
the
course
of
the
day
somebody
would
have
to
coach
him
he
began
to
clamor
for
memoranda
he
found
he
could
not
read
his
mail
he
demanded
somebody
who
would
the
interesting
sentences
in
the
important
letters
he
found
he
could
not
digest
the
great
stacks
of
reports
that
grew
mellow
on
his
desk
he
demanded
summaries
he
found
he
could
not
read
an
unending
series
of
figures
he
embraced
the
man
who
made
colored
pictures
of
them
he
found
that
he
really
did
not
know
one
machine
from
another
he
hired
engineers
to
pick
them
and
tell
him
how
much
they
cost
and
what
they
could
do
he
peeled
off
one
burden
after
another
as
a
man
will
take
off
first
his
hat
then
his
coat
then
his
collar
when
he
is
struggling
to
move
an
unwieldy
load
yet
curiously
enough
though
he
knew
that
he
needed
help
he
was
slow
to
call
in
the
social
scientist
the
chemist
the
physicist
the
geologist
had
a
much
earlier
and
more
friendly
reception
laboratories
were
set
up
for
them
inducements
offered
for
there
was
quick
appreciation
of
the
victories
over
nature
but
the
scientist
who
has
human
nature
as
his
problem
is
in
a
different
case
there
are
many
reasons
for
this
the
chief
one
that
he
has
so
few
victories
to
exhibit
he
has
so
few
because
unless
he
deals
with
the
historic
past
he
can
not
prove
his
theories
before
offering
them
to
the
public
the
physical
scientist
can
make
an
hypothesis
test
it
revise
the
hypothesis
hundreds
of
times
and
if
after
all
that
he
is
wrong
no
one
else
has
to
pay
the
price
but
the
social
scientist
can
not
begin
to
offer
the
assurance
of
a
laboratory
test
and
if
his
advice
is
followed
and
he
is
wrong
the
consequences
may
be
incalculable
he
is
in
the
nature
of
things
far
more
responsible
and
far
less
certain
but
more
than
that
in
the
laboratory
sciences
the
student
has
conquered
the
dilemma
of
thought
and
action
he
brings
a
sample
of
the
action
to
a
quiet
place
where
it
can
be
repeated
at
will
and
examined
at
leisure
but
the
social
scientist
is
constantly
being
impaled
on
a
dilemma
if
he
stays
in
his
library
where
he
has
the
leisure
to
think
he
has
to
rely
upon
the
exceedingly
casual
and
meager
printed
record
that
comes
to
him
through
official
reports
newspapers
and
interviews
if
he
goes
out
into
the
world
where
things
are
happening
he
has
to
serve
a
long
often
wasteful
apprenticeship
before
he
is
admitted
to
the
sanctum
where
they
are
being
decided
what
he
can
not
do
is
to
dip
into
action
and
out
again
whenever
it
suits
him
there
are
no
privileged
listeners
the
man
of
affairs
observing
that
the
social
scientist
knows
only
from
the
outside
what
he
knows
in
part
at
least
from
the
inside
recognizing
that
the
social
scientist
hypothesis
is
not
in
the
nature
of
things
susceptible
of
laboratory
proof
and
that
verification
is
possible
only
in
the
real
world
has
developed
a
rather
low
opinion
of
social
scientists
who
do
not
share
his
views
of
public
policy
in
his
heart
of
hearts
the
social
scientist
shares
this
estimate
of
himself
he
has
little
inner
certainty
about
his
own
work
he
only
half
believes
in
it
and
being
sure
of
nothing
he
can
find
no
compelling
reason
for
insisting
on
his
own
freedom
of
thought
what
can
he
actually
claim
for
it
in
the
light
of
his
own
conscience

no
may
his
data
are
uncertain
his
means
of
verification
lacking
the
very
best
qualities
in
him
are
a
source
of
frustration
for
if
he
is
really
critical
and
saturated
in
the
scientific
spirit
he
can
not
be
doctrinaire
and
go
to
armageddon
against
the
trustees
and
the
students
and
the
civic
federation
and
the
conservative
press
for
a
theory
of
which
he
is
not
sure
if
you
are
going
to
armageddon
you
have
to
battle
for
the
lord
but
the
political
scientist
is
always
a
little
doubtful
whether
the
lord
called
him
consequently
if
so
much
of
social
science
is
apologetic
rather
than
constructive
the
explanation
lies
in
the
opportunities
of
social
science
not
in
capitalism
the
physical
scientists
achieved
their
freedom
from
clericalism
by
working
out
a
method
that
produced
conclusions
of
a
sort
that
could
not
be
suppressed
or
ignored
they
convinced
themselves
and
acquired
dignity
and
knew
what
they
were
fighting
for
the
social
scientist
will
acquire
his
dignity
and
his
strength
when
he
has
worked
out
his
method
he
will
do
that
by
turning
into
opportunity
the
need
among
directing
men
of
the
great
society
for
instruments
of
analysis
by
which
an
invisible
and
made
intelligible
but
as
things
go
now
the
social
scientist
assembles
his
data
out
of
a
mass
of
unrelated
material
social
processes
are
recorded
spasmodically
quite
often
as
accidents
of
administration
a
report
to
congress
a
debate
an
investigation
legal
briefs
a
census
a
tariff
a
tax
schedule
the
material
like
the
skull
of
the
piltdown
man
has
to
be
put
together
by
ingenious
inference
before
the
student
obtains
any
sort
of
picture
of
the
event
he
is
studying
though
it
deals
with
the
conscious
life
of
his
fellow
citizens
it
is
all
too
often
distressingly
opaque
because
the
man
who
is
trying
to
generalize
has
practically
no
supervision
of
the
way
his
data
are
collected
imagine
medical
research
conducted
by
students
who
could
rarely
go
into
a
hospital
were
deprived
of
animal
experiment
and
compelled
to
draw
conclusions
from
the
stories
of
people
who
had
been
ill
the
reports
of
nurses
each
of
whom
had
her
own
system
of
diagnosis
and
the
statistics
compiled
by
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
on
the
excess
profits
of
druggists
the
social
scientist
has
usually
to
make
what
he
can
out
of
categories
that
were
uncritically
in
the
mind
of
an
official
who
administered
some
part
of
a
law
or
who
was
out
to
justify
to
persuade
to
claim
or
to
prove
the
student
knows
this
and
as
a
protection
against
it
has
developed
that
branch
of
scholarship
which
is
an
elaborated
suspicion
about
where
to
discount
his
information
that
is
a
virtue
but
it
becomes
a
very
thin
virtue
when
it
is
merely
a
corrective
for
the
unwholesome
position
of
social
science
for
the
scholar
is
condemned
to
guess
as
shrewdly
as
he
can
why
in
a
situation
not
clearly
understood
something
or
other
may
have
happened
but
the
expert
who
is
employed
as
the
mediator
among
representatives
and
as
the
mirror
and
measure
of
administration
has
a
very
different
control
of
the
facts
instead
of
being
the
man
who
generalizes
from
the
facts
dropped
to
him
by
the
men
of
action
he
becomes
the
man
who
prepares
the
facts
for
the
men
of
action
this
is
a
profound
change
in
his
strategic
position
he
no
longer
stands
outside
chewing
the
cud
provided
by
busy
men
of
affairs
but
he
takes
his
place
in
front
of
decision
instead
of
behind
it
the
sequence
is
that
the
man
of
affairs
finds
his
facts
and
decides
on
the
basis
of
them
then
some
time
later
the
social
scientist
deduces
excellent
reasons
why
he
did
or
did
not
decide
wisely
this
ex
post
facto
relationship
is
academic
in
the
bad
sense
of
that
fine
word
the
real
sequence
should
be
one
where
the
disinterested
expert
first
finds
and
formulates
the
facts
for
the
man
of
action
and
later
makes
what
wisdom
he
can
out
of
comparison
between
the
decision
which
he
understands
and
the
facts
which
he
organized
for
the
physical
sciences
this
change
in
strategic
position
began
slowly
and
then
accelerated
rapidly
there
was
a
time
when
the
inventor
and
the
engineer
were
romantic
outsiders
treated
as
cranks
the
business
man
and
the
artisan
knew
all
the
mysteries
of
their
craft
then
the
mysteries
grew
more
mysterious
and
at
last
industry
began
to
depend
upon
physical
laws
and
chemical
combinations
that
no
eye
could
see
and
only
a
trained
mind
could
conceive
the
scientist
moved
from
his
noble
garret
in
the
latin
quarter
into
office
buildings
and
laboratories
for
he
alone
could
construct
a
working
image
of
the
reality
on
which
industry
rested
from
the
new
relationship
he
took
as
much
as
he
gave
perhaps
more
pure
science
developed
faster
than
applied
though
it
drew
its
economic
support
a
great
deal
of
its
inspiration
and
even
more
of
its
relevancy
from
constant
contact
with
practical
decision
but
physical
science
still
labored
under
the
enormous
limitation
that
the
men
who
made
decisions
had
only
their
commonsense
to
guide
them
they
administered
without
scientific
aid
a
world
complicated
by
scientists
again
they
had
to
deal
with
facts
they
could
not
apprehend
and
as
once
they
had
to
call
in
engineers
they
now
have
to
call
in
statisticians
accountants
experts
of
all
sorts
these
practical
students
are
the
true
pioneers
of
a
new
social
science
they
are
in
mesh
with
the
driving
wheels

which
to
work
in
the
exchange
of
technic
and
result
among
expert
staffs
one
can
see
i
think
the
beginning
of
experimental
method
in
social
science
when
each
school
district
and
budget
and
health
department
and
factory
and
tariff
schedule
is
the
material
of
knowledge
for
every
other
the
number
of
comparable
experiences
begins
to
approach
the
dimensions
of
genuine
experiment
in
states
and
cities
and
school
houses
manufacturing
establishments
mines
and
quarries
there
is
a
wealth
of
experience
if
only
it
were
recorded
and
available
and
there
is
too
opportunity
for
trial
and
error
at
such
slight
risk
that
any
reasonable
hypothesis
might
be
given
a
fair
test
without
shaking
the
foundations
of
society
the
wedge
has
been
driven
not
only
by
some
directors
of
industry
and
some
statesmen
who
had
to
have
help
but
by
the
bureaus
of
municipal
research
footnote
the
number
of
these
organizations
in
the
united
states
is
very
great
some
are
alive
some
half
dead
they
are
in
rapid
flux

of
them

chapter

intelligence
work
the
practice
of
democracy
has
been
ahead
of
its
theory
for
the
theory
holds
that
the
adult
electors
taken
together
make
decisions
out
of
a
will
that
is
in
them
but
just
as
there
grew
up
governing
hierarchies
which
were
invisible
in
theory
so
there
has
been
a
large
amount
of
constructive
adaptation
also
unaccounted
for
in
the
image
of
democracy
ways
have
been
found
to
represent
many
interests
and
functions
that
are
normally
out
of
sight
we
are
most
conscious
of
this
in
our
theory
of
the
courts
when
we
explain
their
legislative
powers
and
their
vetoes
on
the
theory
that
there
are
interests
to
be
guarded
which
might
be
forgotten
by
the
elected
officials
but
the
census
bureau
when
it
counts
classifies
and
correlates
people
things
and
changes
is
also
speaking
for
unseen
factors
in
the
environment
the
geological
survey
makes
mineral
resources
evident
the
department
of
agriculture
represents
in
the
councils
of
the
nation
factors
of
which
each
farmer
sees
only
an
infinitesimal
part
school
authorities
the
tariff
commission
the
consular
service
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
give
representation
to
persons
ideas
and
objects
which
would
never
automatically
find
themselves
represented
in
this
perspective
by
an
election
the
children
bureau
is
the
spokesman
of
a
whole
complex
of
interests
and
functions
not
ordinarily
visible
to
the
voter
and
therefore
incapable
of
becoming
spontaneously
a
part
of
his
public
opinions
thus
the
printing
of
comparative
statistics
of
infant
mortality
is
often
followed
by
a
reduction
of
the
death
rate
of
babies
municipal
officials
and
voters
did
not
have
before
publication
a
place
in
their
picture
of
the
environment
for
those
babies
the
statistics
made
them
visible
as
visible
as
if
the
babies
had
elected
an
alderman
to
air
their
grievances
in
the
state
department
the
government
maintains
a
division
of
far
eastern
affairs
what
is
it
for
the
japanese
and
the
chinese
governments
both
maintain
ambassadors
in
washington
are
they
not
qualified
to
speak
for
the
far
east
they
are
its
representatives
yet
nobody
would
argue
that
the
american
government
could
learn
all
that
it
needed
to
know
about
the
far
east
by
consulting
these
ambassadors
supposing
them
to
be
as
candid
as
they
know
how
to
be
they
are
still
limited
channels
of
information
therefore
to
supplement
them
we
maintain
embassies
in
tokio
and
peking
and
consular
agents
at
many
points
also
i
assume
some
secret
agents
these
people
are
supposed
to
send
reports
which
pass
through
the
division
of
far
eastern
affairs
to
the
secretary
of
state
now
what
does
the
secretary
expect
of
the
division
i
know
one
who
expected
it
to
spend
its
appropriation
but
there
are
secretaries
to
whom
special
revelation
is
denied
and
they
turn
to
their
divisions
for
help
the
last
thing
they
expect
to
find
is
a
neat
argument
justifying
the
american
position
what
they
demand
is
that
the
experts
shall
bring
the
far
east
to
the
secretary
desk
with
all
the
elements
in
such
relation
that
it
is
as
if
he
were
in
contact
with
the
far
east
itself
the
expert
must
translate
simplify
generalize
but
the
inference
from
the
result
must
apply
in
the
east
not
merely
on
the
premises
of
the
report
if
the
secretary
is
worth
his
salt
the
very
last
thing
he
will
tolerate
in
his
experts
is
the
suspicion
that
they
have
a
policy
he
does
not
want
to
know
from
them
whether
they
like
japanese
policy
in
china
he
wants
to
know
what
different
classes
of
chinese
and
japanese
english
frenchmen
germans
and
russians
think
about
it
and
what
they
are
likely
to
do
because
of
what
they
think
he
wants
all
that
represented
to
him
as
the
basis
of
his
decision
the
more
faithfully
the
division
represents
what
is
not
otherwise
represented
either
by
the
japanese
or
american
ambassadors
or
the
senators
and
congressmen
from
the
pacific
coast
the
better
secretary
of
state
he
will
be
he
may
decide
to
take
his
policy
from
the
pacific
coast
but
he
will
take
his
view
of
japan
from
japan
it
is
no
accident
that
the
best
diplomatic
service
in
the
world
is
the
one
in
which
the
divorce
between
the
assembling
of
knowledge
and
the
control
of
policy
is
most
perfect
during
the
war
in
many
british
embassies
and
in
the
british
foreign
office
there
were
nearly
always
men
permanent
officials
or
else
special
appointees
who
quite
successfully
discounted
the
prevailing
war
mind
they
discarded
the
rigmarole
of
being
pro
and
con
of
having
favorite
nationalities
and
pet
aversions
and
undelivered
perorations
in
their
bosoms
they
left
that
to
the
political
chiefs
but
in
an
american
embassy
i
once
heard
an
ambassador
say
that
he
never
reported
anything
to
washington
which
would
not
cheer
up
the
folks
at
home
he
charmed
all
those
who
met
him
helped
many
a
stranded
war
worker
and
was
superb
when
he
unveiled
a
monument
he
did
not
understand
that
the
power
of
the
expert
depends
upon
separating
himself
from
those
who
make
the
decisions
upon
not
caring
in
his
expert
self
what
decision
is
made
the
man
who
like
the
ambassador
takes
a
line
and
meddles
with
the
decision
is
soon
discounted
there
he
is
just
one
more
on
that
side
of
the
question
for
when
he
begins
to
care
too
much
he
begins
to
see
what
he
wishes
to
see
and
by
that
fact
ceases
to
see
what
he
is
there
to
see
he
is
there
to
represent
the
unseen
he
represents
people
who
are
not
voters
functions
of
voters
that
are
not
evident
events
that
are
out
of
sight
mute
people
unborn
people
relations
between
things
and
people
he
has
a
constituency
of
intangibles
and
intangibles
can
not
be
used
to
form
a
political
majority
because
voting
is
in
the
last
analysis
a
test
of
strength
a
sublimated
battle
and
the
expert
represents
no
strength
available
in
the
immediate
but
he
can
exercise
force
by
disturbing
the
line
up
of
the
forces
by
making
the
invisible
visible
he
confronts
the
people
who
exercise
material
force
with
a
new
environment
sets
ideas
and
feelings
at
work
in
them
throws
them
out
of
position
and
so
in
the
profoundest
way
affects
the
decision
men
can
not
long
act
in
a
way
that
they
know
is
a
contradiction
of
the
environment
as
they
conceive
it
if
they
are
bent
on
acting
in
a
certain
way
they
have
to
reconceive
the
environment
they
have
to
censor
out
to
rationalize
but
if
in
their
presence
there
is
an
insistent
fact
which
is
so
obtrusive
that
they
can
not
explain
it
away
one
of
three
courses
is
open
they
can
perversely
ignore
it
though
they
will
cripple
themselves
in
the
process
will
overact
their
part
and
come
to
grief
they
can
take
it
into
account
but
refuse
to
act
they
pay
in
internal
discomfort
and
frustration
or
and
i
believe
this
to
be
the
most
frequent
case
they
adjust
their
whole
behavior
to
the
enlarged
environment
the
idea
that
the
expert
is
an
ineffectual
person
because
he
lets
others
make
the
decisions
is
quite
contrary
to
experience
the
more
subtle
the
elements
that
enter
into
the
decision
the
more
irresponsible
power
the
expert
wields
he
is
certain
moreover
to
exercise
more
power
in
the
future
than
ever
he
did
before
because
increasingly
the
relevant
facts
will
elude
the
voter
and
the
administrator
all
governing
agencies
will
tend
to
organize
bodies
of
research
and
information
which
will
throw
out
tentacles
and
expand
as
have
the
intelligence
departments
of
all
the
armies
in
the
world
but
the
experts
will
remain
human
beings
they
will
enjoy
power
and
their
temptation
will
be
to
appoint
themselves
censors
and
so
absorb
the
real
function
of
decision
unless
their
function
is
correctly
defined
they
will
tend
to
pass
on
the
facts
they
think
appropriate
and
to
pass
down
the
decisions
they
approve
they
will
tend
in
short
to
become
a
bureaucracy
the
only
institutional
safeguard
is
to
separate
as
absolutely
as
it
is
possible
to
do
so
the
staff
which
executes
from
the
staff
which
investigates
the
two
should
be
parallel
but
quite
distinct
bodies
of
men
recruited
differently
paid
if
possible
from
separate
funds
responsible
to
different
heads
intrinsically
uninterested
in
each
other
personal
success
in
industry
the
auditors
accountants
and
inspectors
should
be
independent
of
the
manager
the
superintendents
foremen
and
in
time
i
believe
we
shall
come
to
see
that
in
order
to
bring
industry
under
social
control
the
machinery
of
record
will
have
to
be
independent
of
the
boards
of
directors
and
the
shareholders
but
in
building
the
intelligence
sections
of
industry
and
politics
we
do
not
start
on
cleared
ground
and
apart
from
insisting
on
this
basic
separation
of
function
it
would
be
cumbersome
to
insist
too
precisely
on
the
form
which
in
any
particular
instance
the
principle
shall
take
there
are
men
who
believe
in
intelligence
work
and
will
adopt
it
there
are
men
who
do
not
understand
it
but
can
not
do
their
work
without
it
there
are
men
who
will
resist
but
provided
the
principle
has
a
foothold
somewhere
in
every
social
agency
it
will
make
progress
and
the
way
to
begin
is
to
begin
in
the
federal
government
for
example
it
is
not
necessary
to
straighten
out
the
administrative
tangle
and
the
illogical
duplications
of
a
century
growth
in
order
to
find
a
neat
place
for
the
intelligence
bureaus
which
washington
so
badly
needs
before
election
you
can
promise
to
rush
bravely
into
the
breach
but
when
you
arrive
there
all
out
of
breath
you
find
that
each
absurdity
is
invested
with
habits
strong
interests
and
chummy
congressmen
attack
all
along
the
line
and
you
engage
every
force
of
reaction
you
go
forth
to
battle
as
the
poet
said
and
you
always
fall
you
can
lop
off
an
antiquated
bureau
here
a
covey
of
clerks
there
you
can
combine
two
bureaus
and
by
that
time
you
are
busy
with
the
tariff
and
the
railroads
and
the
era
of
reform
is
over
besides
in
order
to
effect
a
truly
logical
reorganization
of
the
government
such
as
all
candidates
always
promise
you
would
have
to
disturb
more
passions
than
you
have
time
to
quell
and
any
new
scheme
supposing
you
had
one
ready
would
require
officials
to
man
it
say
what
one
will
about
officeholders
even
soviet
russia
was
glad
to
get
many
of
the
old
ones
back
and
these
old
officials
if
they
are
too
ruthlessly
treated
will
sabotage
utopia
itself
no
administrative
scheme
is
workable
without
good
will
and
good
will
about
strange
practices
is
impossible
without
education
the
better
way
is
to
introduce
into
the
existing
machinery
wherever
you
can
find
an
opening
agencies
that
will
hold
up
a
mirror
week
by
week
month
by
month
you
can
hope
then
to
make
the
machine
visible
to
those
who
work
it
as
well
as
to
the
chiefs
who
are
responsible
and
to
the
public
outside
when
the
begin
to
see
themselves
or
rather
when
the
outsiders
the
chiefs
and
the
subordinates
all
begin
to
see
the
same
facts
the
same
damning
facts
if
you
like
the
obstruction
will
diminish
the
reformer
opinion
that
a
certain
bureau
is
inefficient
is
just
his
opinion
not
so
good
an
opinion
in
the
eyes
of
the
bureau
as
its
own
but
let
the
work
of
that
bureau
be
analysed
and
recorded
and
then
compared
with
other
bureaus
and
with
private
corporations
and
the
argument
moves
to
another
plane
there
are
ten
departments
at
washington
represented
in
the
cabinet
suppose
then
there
was
a
permanent
intelligence
section
for
each
what
would
be
some
of
the
conditions
of
effectiveness
beyond
all
others
that
the
intelligence
officials
should
be
independent
both
of
the
congressional
committees
dealing
with
that
department
and
of
the
secretary
at
the
head
of
it
that
they
should
not
be
entangled
either
in
decision
or
in
action
independence
then
would
turn
mainly
on
three
points
on
funds
tenure
and
access
to
the
facts
for
clearly
if
a
particular
congress
or
departmental
official
can
deprive
them
of
money
dismiss
them
or
close
the
files
the
staff
becomes
its
creature
the
question
of
funds
is
both
important
and
difficult
no
agency
of
research
can
be
really
free
if
it
depends
upon
annual
doles
from
what
may
be
a
jealous
or
a
parsimonious
congress
yet
the
ultimate
control
of
funds
can
not
be
removed
from
the
legislature
the
financial
arrangement
should
insure
the
staff
against
joker
and
rider
attack
against
sly
destruction
and
should
at
the
same
time
provide
for
growth
the
staff
should
be
so
well
entrenched
that
an
attack
on
its
existence
would
have
to
be
made
in
the
open
it
might
perhaps
work
behind
a
federal
charter
creating
a
trust
fund
and
a
sliding
scale
over
a
period
of
years
based
on
the
appropriation
for
the
department
to
which
the
intelligence
bureau
belonged
no
great
sums
of
money
are
involved
anyway
the
trust
fund
might
cover
the
overhead
and
capital
charges
for
a
certain
minimum
staff
the
sliding
scale
might
cover
the
enlargements
at
any
rate
the
appropriation
should
be
put
beyond
accident
like
the
payment
of
any
long
term
obligation
this
is
a
much
less
serious
way
of
tying
the
hands
of
congress
than
is
the
passage
of
a
constitutional
amendment
or
the
issuance
of
government
bonds
congress
could
repeal
the
charter
but
it
would
have
to
repeal
it
not
throw
monkey
wrenches
into
it
tenure
should
be
for
life
with
provision
for
retirement
on
a
liberal
pension
with
sabbatical
years
set
aside
for
advanced
study
and
training
and
with
dismissal
only
after
a
trial
by
professional
colleagues
the
conditions
which
apply
to
any
intellectual
career
should
apply
here
if
the
work
is
to
be
salient
the
men
who
do
it
must
have
dignity
security
and
in
the
upper
ranks
at
least
that
freedom
of
mind
which
you
find
only
where
men
are
not
too
immediately
concerned
in
practical
decision
access
to
the
materials
should
be
established
in
the
organic
act
the
bureau
should
have
the
right
to
examine
all
papers
and
to
question
any
official
or
any
outsider
continuous
investigation
of
this
sort
would
not
at
all
resemble
the
sensational
legislative
inquiry
and
the
spasmodic
fishing
expedition
which
are
now
a
common
feature
of
our
government
the
bureau
should
have
the
right

propose
accounting
methods

the
proposal
is
rejected
or
violated
after
it
has
been
accepted
to
appeal
under
its
charter
to
congress
in
the
first
instance
each
intelligence
bureau
would
be
the
connecting
link
between
congress
and
the
department
a
better
link
in
my
judgment
than
the
appearance
of
cabinet
officers
on
the
floor
of
both
house
and
senate
though
the
one
proposal
in
no
way
excludes
the
other
the
bureau
would
be
the
congressional
eye
on
the
execution
of
its
policy
it
would
be
the
departmental
answer
to
congressional
criticism
and
then
since
operation
of
the
department
would
be
permanently
visible
perhaps
congress
would
cease
to
feel
the
need
of
that
minute
legislation
born
of
distrust
and
a
false
doctrine
of
the
separation
of
powers
which
does
so
much
to
make
efficient
administration
difficult
but
of
course
each
of
the
ten
bureaus
could
not
work
in
a
watertight
compartment
in
their
relation
one
to
another
lies
the
best
chance
for
that
coordination
of
which
so
much
is
heard
and
so
little
seen
clearly
the
various
staffs
would
need
to
adopt
wherever
possible
standards
of
measurement
that
were
comparable
they
would
exchange
their
records
then
if
the
war
department
and
the
post
office
both
buy
lumber
hire
carpenters
or
construct
brick
walls
they
need
not
necessarily
do
them
through
the
same
agency
for
that
might
mean
cumbersome
but
they
would
be
able
to
use
the
same
measure
for
the
same
things
be
conscious
of
the
comparisons
and
be
treated
as
competitors
and
the
more
competition
of
this
sort
the
better
for
the
value
of
competition
is
determined
by
the
value
of
the
standards
used
to
measure
it
instead
then
of
asking
ourselves
whether
we
believe
in
competition
we
should
ask
ourselves
whether
we
believe
in
that
for
which
the
competitors
compete
no
one
in
his
senses
expects
to
abolish
competition
for
when
the
last
vestige
of
emulation
had
disappeared
social
effort
would
consist
in
mechanical
obedience
to
a
routine
tempered
in
a
minority
by
native
inspiration
yet
no
one
expects
to
work
out
competition
to
its
logical
conclusion
in
a
murderous
struggle
of
each
against
all
the
problem
is
to
select
the
goals
of
competition
and
the
rules
of
the
game
almost
always
the
most
visible
and
obvious
standard
of
measurement
will
determine
the
rules
of
the
game
such
as
money
power
popularity
applause
or
veblen
conspicuous
waste
what
other
standards
of
measurement
does
our
civilization
normally
provide
how
does
it
measure
efficiency
productivity
service
for
which
we
are
always
clamoring
by
and
large
there
are
no
measures
and
there
is
therefore
not
so
much
competition
to
achieve
these
ideals
for
the
difference
between
the
higher
and
the
lower
motives
is
not
as
men
often
assert
a
difference
between
altruism
and
selfishness
footnote
ch
xii
it
is
a
difference
between
acting
for
easily
understood
aims
and
for
aims
that
are
obscure
and
vague
exhort
a
man
to
make
more
profit
than
his
neighbor
and
he
knows
at
what
to
aim
exhort
him
to
render
more
social
service
and
how
is
he
to
be
certain
what
service
is
social
what
is
the
test
what
is
the
measure
a
subjective
feeling
somebody
opinion
tell
a
man
in
time
of
peace
that
he
ought
to
serve
his
country
and
you
have
uttered
a
pious
platitude
tell
him
in
time
of
war
and
the
word
service
has
a
meaning
it
is
a
number
of
concrete
acts
enlistment
or
buying
bonds
or
saving
food
or
working
for
a
dollar
a
year
and
each
one
of
these
services
he
sees
definitely
as
part
of
a
concrete
purpose
to
put
at
the
front
an
army
larger
and
better
armed
than
the
enemy
so
the
more
you
are
able
to
analyze
administration
and
work
out
elements
that
can
be
compared
the
more
you
invent
quantitative
measures
for
the
qualities
you
wish
to
promote
the
more
you
can
turn
competition
to
ideal
ends

you

contrive
the

the
term

to

in

information
is
probably
scattered
through
the
departments
of
interior

either
a
clerk
in

looks
up

the

should
be
able
to
call
on
its
own
intelligence
bureau
to
assemble
the
facts
in
a
way
suited
to
the

the

pretty

become

the
most
extraordinary
kind

the
men
in

what
the

are

problems
of

would
traverse
concretely
the
whole

of
the

it

difficult

see
why
all
this
material
except
a

diplomatic

military
secrets
should
not
be
open
to
the

it

for

students
to
make
the
work
need
not
all
be
done
in

it
could
be
done
in

to
washington
the
central
agency
would
thus
have
in
it
the
makings
of
a
national
university
the
staff
could
be
recruited
there
for
the
bureaus
from
among
college
graduates
they
would
be
working
on
theses
selected
after
consultation

the
curators
of

national
university
and
teachers
scattered

if
the
association
was
as
flexible
as
it
ought
to
be
there
would
be
as
a
supplement

the
permanent

a
steady
turnover
of

specialist
appointments
from

and

lecturers
called
out
from

thus
the
training
and
the
recruiting
of
the
staff
would
go
together
a
part
of
the
research
itself
would
be
done
by
students
and
political
science
in
the
universities
would
be
associated
with
politics
in
america
in
its
main
outlines
the
principle
is
equally
applicable
to
state
governments
to
cities
and
to
rural
counties
the
work
of
comparison
and
interchange
could
take
place
by
federations
of
state

city
and
county
bureaus
and
within
those
federations
any
desirable
regional
combination
could
be
organized
so

a

regional

they
have
a

in

that
it

disturb
by
coordinating
their
information
several
administrative
areas
could
reconcile
autonomy
of
decision
with
cooperation
new

already
an
unwieldy
unit
for

yet
for
many
purposes
such

health
and
transportation
the
metropolitan
district
is
the
true
unit
of
administration
in
that
district
however
there
are
large
cities
like
yonkers
jersey

paterson
elizabeth
hoboken
bayonne
they
could
not
all
be
managed
from

and
yet
they
should
act
together
for
many
functions
ultimately
perhaps
some
such
flexible
scheme
of
local

as

may
be
the
proper
solution

such

might

could

that
there
was

a
circulation
of

a
circulation
of

the
risks
of
dry
rot
would
not
be
so
great
nor
would
it
be
true
to
say
that
these
intelligence
bureaus
will
complicate
life
they
will
tend
on
the
contrary
to
simplify
by
revealing
a
complexity
now
so
great
as
to
be
humanly
unmanageable
the
present
fundamentally
invisible
system
of
government
is
so
intricate
that
most
people
have
given
up
trying
to
follow
it
and
because
they
do
not
try
they
are
tempted
to
think
it
comparatively
simple
it
is
on
the
contrary
elusive
concealed
opaque
the
employment
of
an
intelligence
system
would
mean
a
reduction
of
personnel
per
unit
of
result
because
by
making
available
to
all
the
experience
of
each
it
would
reduce
the
amount
of
trial
and
error
and
because
by
making
the
social

visible
it
would
assist

to
it

not
involve
a
great
additional
band
of

if
you
take
into
account
the
time
now
spent
vainly
by
special
investigating
committees
grand
juries
district
attorneys
reform
organizations
and
bewildered
office
holders
in
trying
to
find
their
way
through
a
dark
muddle
if
the
analysis
of
public
opinion
and
of
the
democratic
theories
in
relation
to
the
modern
environment
is
sound
in
principle
then
i
do
not
see
how
one
can
escape
the
conclusion
that
such
intelligence
work
is
the
clue
to
betterment
i
am
not
referring
to
the
few
suggestions
contained
in
this
chapter
they
are
merely
illustrations
the
task
of
working
out
the
technic
is
in
the
hands
of
men
trained
to
do
it
and
not
even
they
can
completely
foresee
the
form
much
less
the
details
the
number
of
social
phenomena
which
are
now
recorded
is
small
the
instruments
of
analysis
are
very
crude
the
concepts
often
vague
and
uncriticized
but
enough
has
been
done
to
demonstrate
i
think
that
unseen
environments
can
be
reported
effectively
that
they
can
be
reported
to
divergent
groups
of
people
in
a
way
which
is
neutral
to
their
prejudice
and
capable
of
overcoming
their
subjectivism
if
that
is
true
then
in
working
out
the
intelligence
principle
men
will
find
the
way
to
overcome
the
central
difficulty
of
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
an
unseen
reality
because
of
that
difficulty
it
has
been
impossible
for
any
community
to
reconcile
its
need
for
isolation
with
the
necessity
for
wide
contact
to
reconcile
the
dignity
and
individuality
of
local
decision
with
security
and
wide
coordination
to
secure
effective
leaders
without
sacrificing
responsibility
to
have
useful
public
opinions
without
attempting
universal
public
opinions
on
all
subjects
as
long
as
there
was
no
way
of
establishing
common
versions
of
unseen
events
common
measures
for
separate
actions
the
only
image
of
democracy
that
would
work
even
in
theory
was
one
based
on
an
isolated
community
of
people
whose
political
faculties
were
limited

to

maxim
by
the
range
of
their
vision
but
now
there
is
a
way
out
a
long
one
to
be
sure
but
a
way
it
is
fundamentally
the
same
way
as
that
which
has
enabled

citizen
of
chicago
with
no
better
eyes
or

than
an
athenian
to

it
is

discrepancies

the

is
we
quite
naturally
greet
with

the
reading

would
after
devoting
themselves
to

become

they
are
working
it
makes
what
they
do
visible
and
by
that
much
they
become
more
responsible
to
the
general
public
the
purpose
then
is
not
to
burden
every
citizen
with
expert
opinions
on
all
questions
but
to
push
that
burden
away
from
him
towards
the
responsible
administrator
an
intelligence
system
has
value
of
course
as
a
source
of
general
information
and
as
a
check
on
the
daily
press
but
that
is
secondary
its
real
use
is
as
an
aid
to
representative
government
and
administration
both
in
politics
and
industry
the
demand
for
the
assistance
of
expert
reporters
in
the
shape
of
accountants
statisticians
secretariats
and
the
like
comes
not
from
the
public
but
from
men
doing
public
business
who
can
no
longer
do
it
by
rule
of
thumb
it
is
in
origin
and
in
ideal
an
instrument
for
doing
public
business
better
rather
than
an
instrument
for
knowing
better
how
badly
public
business
is
done
as
a
private
citizen
as
a
sovereign
voter
no
one
could
attempt
to
digest
these
documents
but
as
one
party
to
a
dispute
as
a
committeeman
in
a
legislature
as
an
officer
in
government
business
or
a
trade
union
as
a
member
of
an
industrial
council
reports
on
the
specific
matter
at
issue
will
be
increasingly
welcome
the
private
citizen
interested
in
some
cause
would
belong
as
he
does
now
to
voluntary
societies
which
employed
a
staff
to
study
the
documents
and
make
reports
that
served
as
a
check
on
officialdom
there
would
be
some
study
of
this
material
by
newspaper
men
and
a
good
deal
by
experts
and
by
political
scientists
but
the
outsider
and
every
one
of
us
is
an
outsider
to
all
but
a
few
aspects
of
modern
life
has
neither
time
nor
attention
nor
interest
nor
the
equipment
for
specific
judgment
it
is
on
the
men
inside
working
under
conditions
that
are
sound
that
the
daily
administrations
of
society
must
rest
the
general
public
outside
can
arrive
at
judgments
about
whether
these
conditions
are
sound
only
on
the
result
after
the
event
and
on
the
procedure
before
the
event
the
broad
principles
on
which
the
action
of
public
opinion
can
be
continuous
are
essentially
principles
of
procedure
the
outsider
can
ask
experts
to
tell
him
whether
the
relevant
facts
were
duly
considered
he
can
not
in
most
cases
decide
for
himself
what
is
relevant
or
what
is
due
consideration
the
outsider
can
perhaps
judge
whether
the
groups
interested
in
the
decision
were
properly
heard
whether
the
ballot
if
there
was
one
was
honestly
taken
and
perhaps
whether
the
result
was
honestly
accepted
he
can
watch
the
procedure
when
the
news
indicates
that
there
is
something
to
watch
he
can
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
the
procedure
itself
is
right
if
its
normal
results
conflict
with
his
ideal
of
a
good
life
footnote
chapter
xx
but
if
he
tries
in
every
case
to
substitute
himself
for
the
procedure
to
bring
in
public
opinion
like
a
providential
uncle
in
the
crisis
of
a
play
he
will
confound
his
own
confusion
he
will
not
follow
any
train
of
thought
consecutively
for
the
practice
of
appealing
to
the
public
on
all
sorts
of
intricate
matters
means
almost
always
a
desire
to
escape
criticism
from
those
who
know
by
enlisting
a
large
majority
which
has
had
no
chance
to
know
the
verdict
is
made
to
depend
on
who
has
the
loudest
or
the
most
entrancing
voice
the
most
skilful
or
the
most
brazen
publicity
man
the
best
access
to
the
most
space
in
the
newspapers
for
even
when
the
editor
is
scrupulously
fair
to
the
other
side
fairness
is
not
enough
there
may
be
several
other
sides
unmentioned
by
any
of
the
organized
financed
and
active
partisans
the
private
citizen
beset
by
partisan
appeals
for
the
loan
of
his
public
opinion
will
soon
see
perhaps
that
these
appeals
are
not
a
compliment
to
his
intelligence
but
an
imposition
on
his
good
nature
and
an
insult
to
his
sense
of
evidence
as
his
civic
education
takes
account
of
the
complexity
of
his
environment
he
will
concern
himself
about
the
equity
and
the
sanity
of
procedure
and
even
this
he
will
in
most
cases
expect
his
elected
representative
to
watch
for
him
he
will
refuse
himself
to
accept
the
burden
of
these
decisions
and
will
turn
down
his
thumbs
in
most
cases
on
those
who
in
their
hurry
to
win
rush
from
the
conference
table
with
the
first
dope
for
the
reporters
only
by
insisting
that
problems
shall
not
come
up
to
him
until
they
have
passed
through
a
procedure
can
the
busy
citizen
of
a
modern
state
hope
to
deal
with
them
in
a
form
that
is
intelligible
for
issues
as
they
are
stated
by
a
partisan
almost
always
consist
of
an
intricate
series
of
facts
as
he
has
observed
them
surrounded
by
a
large
fatty
mass
of
stereotyped
phrases
charged
with
his
emotion
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
day
he
will
emerge
from
the
conference
room
insisting
that
what
he
wants
is
some
soulfilling
idea
like
justice
welfare
americanism
socialism
on
such
issues
the
citizen
outside
can
sometimes
be
provoked
to
fear
or
admiration
but
to
judgment
never
before
he
can
do
anything
with
the
argument
the
fat
has
to
be
boiled
out
of
it
for
him
that
can
be
done
by
having
the
representative
inside
carry
on
discussion
in
the
presence
of
some
one
chairman
or
mediator
who
forces
the
discussion
to
deal
with
the
analyses
supplied
by
experts
this
is
the
essential
organization
of
any
representative
body
dealing
with
distant
matters
the
partisan
voices
should
be
there
but
the
partisans
should
find
themselves
confronted
with
men
not
personally
involved
who
control
enough
facts
and
have
the
dialectical
skill
to
sort
out
what
is
real
perception
from
what
is
stereotype
pattern
and
elaboration
it
is
the
socratic
dialogue
with
all
of
energy
for
breaking
through
words
to
meanings
and
something
more
than
that
because
the
dialectic
in
modern
life
must
be
done
by
men
who
have
explored
the
environment
as
well
as
the
human
mind
there
is
for
example
a
grave
dispute
in
the
steel
industry
each
side
issues
a
manifesto
full
of
the
highest
ideals
the
only
public
opinion
that
is
worth
respect
at
this
stage
is
the
opinion
which
insists
that
a
conference
be
organized
for
the
side
which
says
its
cause
is
too
just
to
be
contaminated
by
conference
there
can
be
little
sympathy
since
there
is
no
such
cause
anywhere
among
mortal
men
perhaps
those
who
object
to
conference
do
not
say
quite
that
perhaps
they
say
that
the
other
side
is
too
wicked
they
can
not
shake
hands
with
traitors
all
that
public
opinion
can
do
then
is
to
organize
a
hearing
by
public
officials
to
hear
the
proof
of
wickedness
it
can
not
take
the
partisans
word
for
it
but
suppose
a
conference
is
agreed
to
and
suppose
there
is
a
neutral
chairman
who
has
at
his
beck
and
call
the
consulting
experts
of
the
corporation
the
union
and
let
us
say
the
department
of
labor
judge
gary
states
with
perfect
sincerity
that
his
men
are
well
paid
and
not
overworked
and
then
proceeds
to
sketch
the
history
of
russia
from
the
time
of
peter
the
great
to
the
murder
of
the
czar
foster
rises
states
with
equal
sincerity
that
the
men
are
exploited
and
then
proceeds
to
outline
the
history
of
human
emancipation
from
jesus
of
nazareth
to
abraham
lincoln
at
this
point
the
chairman
calls
upon
the
intelligence
men
for
wage
tables
in
order
to
substitute
for
the
words
well
paid
and
exploited
a
table
showing
what
the
different
classes
paid
does
judge
gary
think
they
are
all
well
paid
he
does
does
foster
think
they
are
all
exploited
no
he
thinks
that
groups
c
m
and
x
are
exploited
what
does
he
mean
by
exploited
he
means
they
are
not
paid
a
living
wage
they
are
says
judge
gary
what
can
a
man
buy
on
that
wage
asks
the
chairman
nothing
says
foster
everything
he
needs
says
judge
gary
the
chairman
consults
the
budgets
and
price
statistics
of
the
government
footnote
see
an
article
on
the
cost
of
living
and
wage
cuts
in
the
july
by
leo
wolman
for
a
brilliant
discussion
of
the
naive
use
of
such
figures
and
the
warning
is
of
particular
importance
because
it
comes
from
an
economist
and
statistician
who
has
himself
done
so
much
to
improve
the
technic
of
industrial
disputes
he
rules
that

can
meet
an
average
budget
but
that
c
and
m
can
not
judge
gary
serves
notice
that
he
does
not
regard
the
official
statistics
as
sound
the
budgets
are
too
high
and
prices
have
come
down
foster
also
serves
notice
of
exception
the
budget
is
too
low
prices
have
gone
up
the
chairman
rules
that
this
point
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
conference
that
the
official
figures
stand
and
that
judge

should
carry
their
appeals
to
the
standing
committee

says
judge

we
shall
be
ruined

we
change
these

scales

do
you

by
ruined
asks
the
chairman
produce
your
books
i
ca
they
are
private
says
judge
gary
what
is
private
does
not
interest
us
says
the
chairman
and
therefore
issues
a
statement
to
the
public
announcing
that
the
wages
of
workers
in
groups
c
and
m
are
much
below
the
official
minimum
living
wage
and
that
judge
gary
declines
to
increase
them
for
reasons
that
he
refuses
to
state
after
a
procedure
of
that
sort
a
public
opinion
in
the
eulogistic
sense
of
the
term
footnote
as
used
by
lowell
in
his
opinion
and
popular
can
exist
the
value
of
expert
mediation
is
not
that
it
sets
up
opinion
to
coerce
the
partisans
but
that
it
disintegrates
partisanship
judge
gary
and
foster
may
remain
as
little
convinced
as
when
they
started
though
even
they
would
have
to
talk
in
a
different
strain
but
almost
everyone
else
who
was
not
personally
entangled
would
save
himself
from
being
entangled
for
the
entangling
stereotypes
and
slogans
to
which
his
reflexes
are
so
ready
to
respond
are
by
this
kind
of
dialectic
untangled
on
many
subjects
of
great
public
importance
and
in
varying
degree
among
different
people
for
more
personal
matters
the
threads
of
memory
and
emotion
are
in
a
snarl
the
same
word

connote
any
number
of
different
ideas
emotions
are
displaced
from
the
images
to
which
they
belong
to
names
which
resemble
the
names
of
these
images
in
the
uncriticized
parts
of
the
mind
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
association
by
mere
clang
contact
and
succession
there
are
stray
emotional
attachments
there
are
words
that
were
names
and
are
masks
in
dreams
reveries
and
panic
we
uncover
some
of
the
disorder
enough
to
see
how
the
naive
mind
is
composed
and
how
it
behaves
when
not
disciplined
by
wakeful
effort
and
external
resistance
we
see
that
there
is
no
more
natural
order
than
in
a
dusty
old
attic
there
is
often
the
same
incongruity
between
fact
idea
and
emotion
as
there
might
be
in
an
opera
house
if
all
the
wardrobes
were
dumped
in
a
heap

all
the

mixed
up

through
the
mist

no

honeycombed
with

there
is
a
good
supply
of
ropes
muscles
and
lampposts
while
this
world
moves
the
spirit
of
liberty
will
burn
in
the
breast
of
man
the
man
who
found
these
phrases
in
his
mind
needs
help
he
needs
a
socrates
who
will
separate
the
words
him
until
he
has
defined
them
and
made
words
the
names
of
ideas
made
them
mean
a
particular
object
and
nothing
else
for
these
tense
syllables
have
got
themselves
connected
in
his
mind
by
primitive
association
and
are
bundled
together
by
his
memories
of
christmas
his
indignation
as
a
conservative
and
his
thrills
as
the
heir
to
a
revolutionary
tradition
sometimes
the
snarl
is
too
huge
and
ancient
for
quick
unravelling
sometimes
as
in
modern
psychotherapy
there
are
layers
upon
layers
of
memory
reaching
back
to
infancy
which
have
to
be
separated
and
named
the
effect
of
naming
the
effect
that
is
of
saying
that
the
labor
groups
c
and
m
but
not
x
are
underpaid
instead
of
saying
that
labor
is
exploited
is
incisive
perceptions
recover
their
identity
and
the
emotion
they
arouse
is
specific
since
it
is
no
longer
reinforced
by
large
and
accidental
connections
with
everything
from
christmas
to
moscow
the
disentangled
idea
with
a
name
of
its
own
and
an
emotion
that
has
been
scrutinized
is
ever
so
much
more
open
to
correction
by
new
data
in
the
problem
it
had
been
imbedded
in
the
whole
personality
had
affiliations
of
some
sort
with
the
whole
ego
a
challenge
would
reverberate
through
the
whole
soul
after
it
has
been
thoroughly
criticized
the
idea
is
no
longer
but
it
is
objectified
it
is
at
arm
length
its
fate
is
not
bound
up
with
my
fate
but
with
the
fate
of
the
outer
world
upon
which
i
am
acting
of
this
kind
will
help
to
bring
our
public
opinions
into
grip
with
the
environment
that
is
the
way
the
enormous
censoring
stereotyping
and
dramatizing
apparatus
can
be
liquidated
where
there
is
no
difficulty
in
knowing
what
the
relevant
environment
is
the
critic
the
teacher
the
physician
can
unravel
the
mind
but
where
the
environment
is
as
obscure
to
the
analyst
as
to
his
pupil
no
analytic
technic
is
sufficient
intelligence
work
is
required
in
political
and
industrial
problems
the
critic
as
such
can
do
something
but
unless
he
can
count
upon
receiving
from
expert
reporters
a
valid
picture
of
the
environment
his
dialectic
can
not
go
far
therefore
though
here
as
in
most
other
matters
education
is
the
supreme
remedy
the
value
of
this
education
will
depend
upon
the
evolution
of
knowledge
and
our
knowledge
of
human
institutions
is
still
extraordinarily
meager
and
impressionistic
the
gathering
of
social
knowledge
is
on
the
whole
still
haphazard
not
as
it
will
have
to
become
the
normal
accompaniment
of
action
and
yet
the
collection
of
information
will
not
be
made
one
may
be
sure
for
the
sake
of
its
ultimate
use
it
will
be
made
because
modern
decision
requires
it
to
be
made
but
as
it
is
being
made
there
will
accumulate
a
body
of
data
which
political
science
can
turn
into
generalization
and
build
up
for
the
schools
into
a
conceptual
picture
of
the
world
when
that
picture
takes
form
civic
education
can
become
a
preparation
for
dealing
with
an
unseen
environment
as
a
working
model
of
the
social
system
becomes
available
to
the
teacher
he
can
use
it
to
make
the
pupil
acutely
aware
of
how
his
mind
works
on
unfamiliar
facts
until
he
has
such
a
model
the
teacher
can
not
hope
to
prepare
men
fully
for
the
world
they
will
find
what
he
can
do
is
to
prepare
them
to
deal
with
that
world
with
a
great
deal
more
sophistication
about
their
own
minds
he
can
by
the
use
of
the
case
method
teach
the
pupil
the
habit
of
examining
the
sources
of
his
information
he
can
teach
him
for
example
to
look
in
his
newspaper
for
the
place
where
the
dispatch
was
filed
for
the
name
of
the
correspondent
the
name
of
the
press
service
the
authority
given
for
the
statement
the
circumstances
under
which
the
statement
was
secured
he
can
teach
the
pupil
to
ask
himself
whether
the
reporter
saw
what
he
describes
and
to
remember
how
that
reporter
described
other
events
in
the
past
he
can
teach
him
the
character
of
censorship
of
the
idea
of
privacy
and
furnish
him
with
knowledge
of
past
propaganda
he
can
by
the
proper
use
of
history
make
him
aware
of
the
stereotype
and
can
educate
a
habit
of
introspection

he

the
study
of
error
is
not
only
in
the
highest
degree
prophylactic
but
it
serves
as
a
stimulating
introduction
to
the
study
of
truth
as
our
minds
become
more
deeply
aware
of
their
own
subjectivism
we
find
a
zest
in
objective
method
that
is
not
otherwise
there
we
see
vividly
as
normally
we
should
not
the
enormous
mischief
and
casual
cruelty
of
our
prejudices
and
the
destruction
of
a
prejudice

painful
at
first
because
of
its
connection
with

an
immense
relief
and
a
fine
pride

it
is
successfully
done
there
is
a
radical
enlargement
of
the

of
attention
as
the
current
categories
dissolve
a
hard

version

the

up
the
scene

there

an
emotional
incentive
to
hearty
appreciation
of
scientific
method
which
otherwise
it
is
not
easy
to
arouse
and
is
impossible
to
sustain
prejudices
are
so
much
easier
and
more
interesting
for
if
you
teach
the
principles
of
science
as
if
they
had
always
been
accepted
their
chief
virtue
as
a
discipline
which
is
objectivity
will
make
them
dull
but
teach
them
at
first
as
victories
over
the
superstitions
of
the
mind
and
the
exhilaration
of
the
chase
and
of
the
conquest
may
carry
the
pupil
over
that
hard
transition
from
his
own
experience
to
the
phase
where
his
curiosity
has
matured
and
his
reason
has
acquired
passion
chapter

the
appeal
to
reason
i
have
written
and
then
thrown
away
several
endings
to
this
book
over
all
of
them
there
hung
that
fatality
of
last
chapters
in
which
every
idea
seems
to
find
its
place
and
all
the
mysteries
that
the
writer
has
not
forgotten
are
unravelled
in
politics
the
hero
does
not
live
happily
ever
after
or
end
his
life
perfectly
there
is
no
concluding
chapter
because
the
hero
in
politics
has
more
future
before
him
than
there
is
recorded
history
behind
him
the
last
chapter
is
merely
a
place
where
the
writer
imagines
that
the
polite
reader
has
begun
to
look
furtively
at
his
watch
when
plato
came
to
the
point
where
it
was
fitting
that
he
should
sum
up
his
assurance
turned
into
as
he
thought
how
absurd
it
would
sound
to
say
what
was
in
him
about
the
place
of
reason
in
politics
those
sentences
in
book
five
of
the
republic
were
hard
even
for
plato
to
speak
they
are
so
sheer
and
so
stark
that
men
can
neither
forget
them
nor
live
by
them
so
he
makes
socrates
say
to
glaucon
that
he
will
be
broken
and
drowned
in
laughter
for
telling
what
is
the
least
change
which
will
enable
a
state
to
pass
into
the
truer
form

because
the
thought
he
would
fain
have
uttered
if
it
had
not
seemed
too
extravagant
was
that
until
philosophers
are
kings
or
the

of
this

no

the

hardly
had
he
said
these
awful
words
when
he
realized
they
were
a
counsel
of
perfection
and
felt
embarrassed
at
the
unapproachable
grandeur
of
his
idea
so
he
hastens
to
add
that
of
course
the
true
pilot
will
be
called
a
prater
a
a
footnote
bk
vi
but
this
wistful
admission
though
it
protects
him
against
whatever
was
the
greek
equivalent
for
the
charge
that
he
lacked
a
sense
of
humor
furnished
a
humiliating
tailpiece
to
a
solemn
thought
he
becomes
defiant
and
warns
adeimantus
that
he
must
attribute
the
uselessness
of
philosophers
to
the
fault
of
those
who
will
not
use
them
and
not
to
themselves
the
pilot
should
not
humbly
beg
the
sailors
to
be
commanded
by
him
that
is
not
the
order
of
nature
and
with
this
haughty
gesture
he
hurriedly
picked
up
the
tools
of
reason
and
disappeared
into
the
academy
leaving
the
world
to
machiavelli
thus
in
the
first
great
encounter
between
reason
and
politics
the
strategy
of
reason
was
to
retire
in
anger
but
meanwhile
as
plato
tells
us
the
ship
is
at
sea
there
have
been
many
ships
on
the
sea
since
plato
wrote
and
whether
we
are
wise
or
foolish
in
our
belief
we
could
no
longer
call
a
man
a
true
pilot
simply
because
he
knows
how
to
pay
attention
to
the
year
and
seasons
and
sky
and
stars
and
winds
and
whatever
else
belongs
to
his
art
footnote
bk
vi
he
can
dismiss
nothing
which
is
necessary
to
make
that
ship
sail
prosperously
because
there
are
mutineers
aboard
he
can
not
say
so
much
the
worse
for
us
all
it
is
not
in
the
order
of
nature
that
i
should
handle
a
mutiny
it
is
not
in
the
order
of
philosophy
that
i
should
consider
mutiny
i
know
how
to
navigate
i
do
not
know
how
to
navigate
a
ship
full
of
sailors
and
if
they
do
not
see
that
i
am
the
man
to
steer
i
can
not
help
it
we
shall
all
go
on
the
rocks
they
to
be
punished
for
their
sins
i
with
the
assurance
that
i
knew
better
whenever
we
make
an
appeal
to
reason
in
politics
the
difficulty
in
this
parable
recurs
for
there
is
an
inherent
difficulty
about
using
the
method
of
reason
to
deal
with
an
unreasoning
world
even
if
you
assume
with
plato
that
the
true
pilot
knows
what
is
best
for
the
ship
you
have
to
recall
that
he
is
not
so
easy
to
recognize
and
that
this
uncertainty
leaves
a
large
part
of
the
crew
unconvinced
by
definition
the
crew
does
not
know
what
he
knows
and
the
pilot
fascinated
by
the
stars
and
winds
does
not
know
how
to
make
the
crew
realize
the
importance
of
what
he
knows
there
is
no
time
during
mutiny
at
sea
to
make
each
sailor
an
expert
judge
of
experts
there
is
no
time
for
the
pilot
to
consult
his
crew
and
find
out
whether
he
is
really
as
wise
as
he
thinks
he
is
for
education
is
a
matter
of
years
the
emergency
a
matter
of
hours
it
would
be
altogether
academic
then
to
tell
the
pilot
that
the
true
remedy
is
for
example
an
education
that
will
endow
sailors
with
a
better
sense
of
evidence
you
can
tell
that
only
to
shipmasters
on
dry
land
in
the
crisis
the
only
advice
is
to
use
a
gun
or
make
a
speech
utter
a
stirring
slogan
offer
a
compromise
employ
any
quick
means
available
to
quell
the
mutiny
the
sense
of
evidence
being
what
it
is
it
is
only
on
shore
where
men
plan
for
many
voyages
that
they
can
afford
to
and
must
for
their
own
salvation
deal
with
those
causes
that
take
a
long
time
to
remove
they
will
be
dealing
in
years
and
generations
not
in
emergencies
alone
and
nothing
will
put
a
greater
strain
upon
their
wisdom
than
the
necessity
of
distinguishing
false
crises
from
real
ones
for
when
there
is
panic
in
the
air
with
one
crisis
tripping
over
the
heels
of
another
actual
dangers
mixed
with
imaginary
scares
there
is
no
chance
at
all
for
the
constructive
use
of
reason
and
any
order
soon
seems
preferable
to
any
disorder
it
is
only
on
the
premise
of
a
certain
stability
over
a
long
run
of
time
that
men
can
hope
to
follow
the
method
of
reason
this
is
not
because
mankind
is
inept
or
because
the
appeal
to
reason
is
visionary
but
because
the
evolution
of
reason
on
political
subjects
is
only
in
its
beginnings
our
rational
ideas
in
politics
are
still
large
thin
generalities
much
too
abstract
and
unrefined
for
practical
guidance
except
where
the
aggregates
are
large
enough
to
cancel
out
individual
peculiarity
and
exhibit
large
uniformities
reason
in
politics
is
especially
immature
in
predicting
the
behavior
of
individual
men
because
in
human
conduct
the
smallest
initial
variation
often
works
out
into
the
most
elaborate
differences
that
perhaps
is
why
when
we
try
to
insist
solely
upon
an
appeal
to
reason
in
dealing
with
sudden
situations
we
are
broken
and
drowned
in
laughter
for
the
rate
at
which
reason
as
we
possess
it
can
advance
itself
is
slower
than
the
rate
at
which
action
has
to
be
taken
in
the
present
state
of
political
science
there
is
therefore
a
tendency
for
one
situation
to
change
into
another
before
the
first
is
clearly
understood
and
so
to
make
much
political
criticism
hindsight
and
little
else
both
in
the
discovery
of
what
is
unknown
and
in
the
propagation
of
that
which
has
been
proved
there
is
a
which
ought
to
in
a
much
greater
degree
than
it
ever
has
occupy
the
political
philosopher
we
have
begun
chiefly
under
the
inspiration
of
graham
wallas
to
examine
the
effect
of
an
invisible
environment
upon
our
opinions
we
do
not
as
yet
understand
except
a
little
by
rule
of
thumb
the
element
of
time
in
politics
though
it
bears
most
directly
upon
the
practicability
of
any
constructive
proposal
footnote
wells
in
the
opening
chapters
of
in
the
we
can
see
for
example
that
somehow
the
relevancy
of
any
plan
depends
upon
the
length
of
time
the
operation
requires
because
on
the
length
of
time
it
will
depend
whether
the
data
which
the
plan
assumes
as
given
will
in
truth
remain
the
same
footnote

better

current

the
intelligence

of
any

facts
there
is
a
factor
here
which
realistic
and
experienced
men
do
take
into
account
and
it
helps
to
mark
them
off
somehow
from
the
opportunist
the
visionary
the
philistine
and
the
pedant
footnote
not
all
but
some
of
the
differences
between
reactionaries
conservatives
liberals
and
radicals
are
due
i
think
to
a
different
intuitive
estimate
of
the
rate
of
change
in
social
affairs
but
just
how
the
calculation
of
time
enters
into
politics
we
do
not
know
at
present
in
any
systematic
way
until
we
understand
these
matters
more
clearly
we
can
at
least
remember
that
there
is
a
problem
of
the
utmost
theoretical
difficulty
and
practical
consequence
it
will
help
us
to
cherish
plato
ideal
without
sharing
his
hasty
conclusion
about
the
perversity
of
those
who
do
not
listen
to
reason
it
is
hard
to
obey
reason
in
politics
because
you
are
trying
to
make
two
processes
march
together
which
have
as
yet
a
different
gait
and
a
different
pace
until
reason
is
subtle
and
particular
the
immediate
struggle
of
politics
will
continue
to
require
an
amount
of
native
wit
force
and
unprovable
faith
that
reason
can
neither
provide
nor
control
because
the
facts
of
life
are
too
undifferentiated
for
its
powers
of
understanding
the
methods
of
social
science
are
so
little
perfected
that
in
many
of
the
serious
decisions
and
most
of
the
casual
ones
there
is
as
yet
no
choice
but
to
gamble
with
fate
as
intuition
prompts
but
we
can
make
a
belief
in
reason
one
of
those
intuitions
we
can
use
our
wit
and
our
force
to
make
footholds
for
reason
behind
our
pictures
of
the
world
we
can
try
to
see
the
vista
of
a
longer
duration
of
events
and
wherever
it
is
possible
to
escape
from
the
urgent
present
allow
this
longer
time
to
control
our
decisions
and
yet
even
when
there
is
this
will
to
let
the
future
count
we
find
again
and
again
that
we
do
not
know
for
certain
how
to
act
according
to
the
dictates
of
reason
the
number
of
human
problems
on
which
reason
is
prepared
to
dictate
is
small
there
is
however
a
noble
counterfeit
in
that
charity
which
comes
from
and
an
unarguable
belief
that
no
one
of
our
gregarious
species
is
alone
in
his
longing
for
a
friendlier
world
so
many
of
the
grimaces
men
make
at
each
other
go
with
a
flutter
of
their
pulse
that
they
are
not
all
of
them
important
and
where
so
much
is
uncertain
where
so
many
actions
have
to
be
carried
out
on
guesses
the
demand
upon
the
reserves
of
mere
decency
is
enormous
and
it
is
necessary
to
live
as
if
good
will
would
work
we
can
not
prove
in
every
instance
that
it
will
nor
why
hatred
intolerance
suspicion
bigotry
secrecy
fear
and
lying
are
the
seven
deadly
sins
against
public
opinion
we
can
only
insist
that
they
have
no
place
in
the
appeal
to
reason
that
in
the
longer
run
they
are
a
poison
and
taking
our
stand
upon
a
view
of
the
world
which
outlasts
our
own
predicaments
and
our
own
lives
we
can
cherish
a
hearty
prejudice
against
them
we
can
do
this
all
the
better
if
we
do
not
allow
frightfulness
and
fanaticism
to
impress
us
so
deeply
that
we
throw
up
our
hands
peevishly
and
lose
interest
in
the
longer
run
of
time
because
we
have
lost
faith
in
the
future
of
man
there
is
no
ground
for
this
despair
because
all
the
on
which
as
james
said
our
destiny
hangs
are
as
pregnant
as
they
ever
were
what
we
have
seen
of
brutality
we
have
seen
and
because
it
was
strange
it
was
not
conclusive
it
was
only
berlin
moscow
versailles
in
to
not
armageddon
as
we
rhetorically
said
the
more
realistically
men
have
faced
out
the
brutality
and
the
hysteria
the
more
they
have
earned
the
right
to
say
that
it
is
not
foolish
for
men
to
believe
because
another
great
war
took
place
that
intelligence
courage
and
effort
can
not
ever
contrive
a
good
life
for
all
men
great
as
was
the
horror
it
was
not
universal
there
were
corrupt
and
there
were
incorruptible
there
was
muddle
and
there
were
miracles
there
was
huge
lying
there
were
men
with
the
will
to
uncover
it
it
is
no
judgment
but
only
a
mood
when
men
deny
that
what
some
men
have
been
more
men
and
ultimately
enough
men
might
be
you
can
despair
of
what
has
never
been
you
can
despair
of
ever
having
three
heads
though
shaw
has
declined
to
despair
even
of
that
but
you
can
not
despair
of
the
possibilities
that
could
exist
by
virtue
of
any
human
quality
which
a
human
being
has
exhibited
and
if
amidst
all
the
evils
of
this
decade
you
have
not
seen
men
and
women
known
moments
that
you
would
like
to
multiply
the
