one
jed
cochrane
tried
to
be
cynical
as
the
helicab
hummed
softly
through
the
night
over
the
city
the
cab
flew
at
two
thousand
feet
where
lighted
buildings
seemed
to
soar
toward
it
from
the
canyons
which
were
streets
there
were
lights
and
people
everywhere
and
cochrane
sardonically
reminded
himself
that
he
was
no
better
than
anybody
else
only
he
been
trying
to
keep
from
realizing
it
he
looked
down
at
the
trees
and
shrubbery
on
the
and
at
a
dance
that
was
going
on
atop
one
of
the
tallest
buildings
all
roofs
were
nowadays
they
were
the
only
spaces
available
when
you
looked
down
at
a
city
like
this
you
had
cynical
thoughts
fourteen
million
people
in
this
city
ten
million
in
that
eight
in
another
and
ten
in
another
still
and
twelve
million
in
yet
another
big
cities
swarming
millions
of
people
all
desperately
anxious
so
cochrane
realized
bitterly
all
desperately
anxious
about
their
jobs
and
keeping
them
even
as
me
and
i
said
cochrane
harshly
to
himself
sure
i
shaking
in
my
shoes
right
along
with
the
rest
of
them
but
it
hurt
to
realize
that
he
been
kidding
himself
he
thought
he
was
important
important
at
least
to
the
advertising
firm
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
but
right
now
he
was
on
the
way
like
a
common
legman
to
take
the
to
lunar
city
and
he
been
informed
of
it
just
thirty
minutes
ago
then
he
been
told
casually
to
get
to
the
right
away
his
secretary
and
two
technical
men
and
a
writer
were
taking
the
same
rocket
he
get
his
instructions
from
william
holden
on
the
way
a
part
of
his
mind
said
indignantly
till
i
get
hopkins
on
the
phone
it
was
a
mixup
he
would
send
me
off
anywhere
with
the
dikkipatti
hour
depending
on
me
he
not
that
crazy
but
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
regardless
he
raged
when
the
message
reached
him
he
insisted
that
he
had
to
talk
to
hopkins
in
person
before
he
obeyed
any
such
instructions
but
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
he
was
riding
in
a
helicab
and
he
was
making
adjustments
in
his
own
mind
to
the
humiliation
he
unconsciously
foresaw
there
were
really
three
levels
of
thought
in
his
mind
one
had
adopted
a
defensive
cynicism
and
one
desperately
insisted
that
he
could
be
as
unimportant
as
his
instructions
implied
and
the
third
watched
the
other
two
as
the
helicab
flew
with
cushioned
booming
noises
over
the
dark
canyons
of
the
city
and
the
innumerable
lonely
lights
of
the
rooftops
there
was
a
thin
roaring
sound
high
aloft
cochrane
jerked
his
head
back
the
stars
filled
all
the
firmament
but
he
knew
what
to
look
for
he
stared
upward
one
of
the
stars
grew
brighter
he
did
know
when
he
first
picked
it
out
but
he
knew
when
he
found
it
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
it
it
was
a
very
white
star
and
for
a
space
of
minutes
it
seemed
in
no
wise
different
from
its
fellows
but
it
grew
brighter
presently
it
was
very
bright
it
was
brighter
than
sirius
in
seconds
more
it
was
brighter
than
venus
it
increased
more
and
more
rapidly
in
its
brilliance
it
became
the
brightest
object
in
all
the
heavens
except
the
crescent
moon
and
the
cold
intensity
of
its
light
was
greater
than
any
part
of
that
then
cochrane
could
see
that
this
star
was
not
quite
round
he
could
detect
the
flame
of
the
it
came
down
with
a
rush
he
saw
the
vertical
stabbing
pencil
of
light
plunge
earthward
it
slowed
remarkably
as
it
plunged
with
all
the
flying
aircraft
above
the
city
harshly
lighted
by
its
glare
the
itself
showed
clearly
cochrane
saw
the
buildings
and
the
other
waiting
to
take
off
in
half
an
hour
or
less
the
white
flame
hit
the
ground
and
splashed
it
spread
out
in
a
wide
flat
disk
of
intolerable
brightness
the
sleek
hull
of
the
ship
which
still
rode
the
flame
down
glinted
vividly
as
it
settled
into
the
inferno
of
its
own
making
then
the
light
went
out
the
glare
cut
off
abruptly
there
was
only
a
dim
redness
where
the
tarmac
had
been
made
incandescent
for
a
little
while
that
glow
faded
and
cochrane
became
aware
of
the
enormous
stillness
he
had
not
really
noticed
the
rocket
deafening
roar
until
it
ended
the
helicab
flew
onward
almost
silently
with
only
the
throbbing
pulses
of
its
overhead
vanes
making
any
sound
at
all
kidded
myself
about
those
rockets
said
cochrane
bitterly
to
himself
thought
getting
to
the
moon
meant
starting
to
the
stars
new
worlds
to
live
on
i
had
a
lot
more
fun
before
i
found
out
the
facts
of
life
but
he
knew
that
this
cynicism
and
this
bitterness
came
out
of
the
hurt
to
the
vanity
that
still
insisted
everything
was
a
mistake
received
orders
which
disillusioned
him
about
his
importance
to
the
firm
and
to
the
business
to
which
he
given
years
of
his
life
it
hurt
to
find
out
that
he
was
just
another
man
just
another
expendable
most
people
fought
against
making
the
discovery
and
some
succeeded
in
avoiding
it
but
cochrane
saw
his
own
with
a
savage
clarity
even
as
he
tried
to
keep
them
he
did
not
admire
himself
at
all
the
helicab
began
to
slant
down
toward
the
buildings
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
the
earth
of
course
was
covered
with
buildings
except
for
the
there
was
no
unoccupied
ground
for
thirty
miles
in
any
direction
the
cab
was
down
to
a
thousand
feet
to
five
hundred
cochrane
saw
the
rocket
with
running
busily
to
and
fro
and
hovering
around
it
he
saw
the
rocket
he
should
take
standing
upright
on
the
faintly
lighted
field
the
cab
touched
ground
cochrane
stood
up
and
paid
the
fare
he
got
out
and
the
cab
rose
four
or
five
feet
and
flitted
over
to
the
he
went
into
the
building
he
felt
himself
growing
more
bitter
still
then
he
found
bill
holden
doctor
william
holden
standing
dejectedly
against
a
wall
i
believe
you
got
some
orders
for
me
bill
said
cochrane
sardonically
and
just
what
psychiatric
help
can
i
give
you
holden
said
tiredly
i
do
like
this
any
better
than
you
do
jed
i
scared
to
death
of
but
go
get
your
ticket
and
i
tell
you
about
it
on
the
way
up
it
a
special
production
job
i
roped
in
on
it
too
happy
holiday
said
cochrane
because
holden
looked
about
as
miserable
as
a
man
could
look
he
went
to
the
ticket
desk
he
gave
his
name
on
request
he
produced
identification
then
he
said
sourly
while
you
working
on
this
i
make
a
he
went
to
a
pay
visiphone
and
again
there
were
different
levels
of
awareness
in
his
mind
one
consciously
and
defensively
cynical
and
one
frightened
at
the
revelation
of
his
unimportance
and
the
third
finding
the
others
an
unedifying
spectacle
he
put
the
call
through
with
an
confidence
which
he
angrily
recognized
as
an
attempt
to
deceive
himself
he
got
the
office
he
said
calmly
this
is
jed
cochrane
i
asked
for
a
visiphone
contact
with
mr
hopkins
he
had
a
secretary
on
the
she
looked
at
memos
and
said
pleasantly
oh
yes
hopkins
is
at
dinner
he
said
he
could
be
disturbed
but
for
you
to
go
on
to
the
moon
according
to
your
instructions
mr
cochrane
cochrane
hung
up
and
raged
with
one
part
of
his
mind
another
part
and
he
despised
it
began
to
argue
that
after
all
he
had
better
wait
before
thinking
there
was
any
intent
to
humiliate
him
after
all
his
orders
must
have
been
issued
with
due
consideration
the
third
part
disliked
the
other
two
parts
intensely
one
for
raging
without
daring
to
speak
and
one
for
trying
to
find
alibis
for
not
even
raging
he
went
back
to
the
the
clerk
said
heartily
here
you
are
the
rest
of
your
party
already
on
board
cochrane
you
better
hurry
in
five
minutes
holden
joined
him
they
went
through
the
gate
and
got
into
the
that
would
rush
them
out
to
the
rocket
holden
said
heavily
i
was
waiting
for
you
and
hoping
you
would
come
i
not
a
good
traveller
jed
the
small
vehicle
rushed
to
a
city
man
the
dark
expanse
of
the
was
astounding
then
a
spidery
metal
framework
swallowed
the
and
them
the
vehicle
stopped
an
elevator
accepted
them
and
lifted
an
indefinite
distance
through
the
night
toward
the
stars
a
sort
of
gangplank
with
a
canvas
siderail
reached
out
across
emptiness
cochrane
crossed
it
and
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
a
spiral
ramp
inside
the
rocket
a
stewardess
looked
at
the
tickets
she
led
the
way
up
and
stopped
this
is
your
seat
cochrane
she
said
professionally
i
strap
you
in
this
first
time
you
do
it
later
cochrane
lay
down
in
a
with
an
mattress
of
foam
rubber
the
stewardess
adjusted
straps
he
thought
bitter
ironic
thoughts
a
voice
said
mr
cochrane
he
turned
his
head
there
was
babs
deane
his
secretary
with
her
eyes
very
bright
she
regarded
him
from
a
exactly
opposite
his
she
said
happily
west
and
jamison
are
the
science
men
cochrane
i
got
bell
as
the
writer
a
great
triumph
cochrane
told
her
did
you
get
any
idea
what
all
this
is
about
why
we
going
up
no
admitted
babs
cheerfully
i
have
the
least
idea
but
i
going
to
the
moon
it
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
cochrane
shrugged
his
shoulders
shrugging
was
not
comfortable
in
the
straps
that
held
him
babs
was
a
good
secretary
she
was
the
only
one
cochrane
had
ever
had
who
did
not
try
to
make
use
of
her
position
as
secretary
to
the
producer
of
the
dikkipatti
hour
on
television
other
secretaries
had
used
their
nearness
to
him
to
wangle
acting
or
dancing
or
singing
assignments
on
other
and
lesser
shows
as
a
rule
they
lasted
just
four
public
appearances
before
they
were
back
at
desks
spoiled
for
further
secretarial
use
by
their
taste
of
fame
but
babs
had
tried
that
yet
she
jumped
at
a
chance
for
a
trip
to
the
moon
a
panel
up
toward
the
nose
of
the
rocket
the
upper
end
of
this
passenger
compartment
glowed
suddenly
flaming
red
letters
said
ninety
cochrane
found
an
ironic
flavor
in
the
thought
that
splendid
daring
and
incredible
technology
had
made
his
coming
journey
possible
heroes
had
ventured
magnificently
into
the
emptiness
beyond
earth
atmosphere
uncountable
millions
of
dollars
had
been
spent
enormous
intelligence
and
infinite
pains
had
been
devoted
to
making
possible
a
journey
of
two
hundred
thousand
miles
through
sheer
nothingness
this
was
the
most
splendid
achievement
of
human
science
the
reaching
of
a
satellite
of
earth
and
the
building
of
a
human
city
there
and
for
what
undoubtedly
so
that
one
jed
cochrane
could
be
ordered
by
telephone
by
somebody
secretary
to
go
and
get
on
a
and
get
to
the
moon
go
having
failed
to
make
a
protest
because
his
boss
would
interrupt
dinner
to
listen
so
he
could
keep
his
job
by
obeying
for
this
splendid
purpose
scientists
had
labored
and
dedicated
men
had
risked
their
lives
of
course
cochrane
reminded
himself
with
conscious
justice
of
course
there
was
the
very
great
value
of
cachets
to
devotees
of
philately
there
was
the
value
of
the
tourist
facilities
to
anybody
who
could
spend
that
much
money
for
something
to
brag
about
afterward
there
were
the
mines
running
at
a
slight
loss
and
various
other
fine
achievements
there
was
even
a
nightclub
in
lunar
city
where
one
highball
cost
the
equivalent
of
say
a
week
pay
for
a
secretary
like
babs
and
the
panel
changed
its
red
glowing
sign
it
said
somewhere
down
below
a
door
closed
with
a
cushioned
soft
definiteness
the
inside
of
the
rocket
suddenly
seemed
extraordinarily
still
the
silence
was
oppressive
it
was
dead
then
there
came
the
whirring
of
very
many
electric
fans
stirring
up
the
air
the
stewardess
voice
came
from
below
him
in
the
upended
cylinder
which
was
the
we
take
off
in
seconds
you
will
find
yourself
feeling
very
heavy
there
is
no
cause
to
be
alarmed
if
you
observe
that
breathing
is
oppressive
the
oxygen
content
of
the
air
in
this
ship
is
well
above
and
you
will
not
need
to
breathe
so
deeply
simply
relax
in
your
chair
everything
has
been
thought
of
everything
has
been
tested
repeatedly
you
need
not
disturb
yourself
at
all
simply
relax
silence
two
three
there
was
a
roar
it
was
a
deep
booming
numbing
roar
that
came
from
somewhere
outside
the
rocket
hull
simultaneously
something
thrust
cochrane
deep
into
the
of
his
he
felt
the
cushion
piling
up
on
all
sides
of
his
body
so
that
it
literally
surrounded
him
it
resisted
the
tendency
of
his
arms
and
legs
and
abdomen
to
flatten
out
and
flow
sidewise
to
spread
him
in
a
thin
layer
over
the
chair
in
which
he
rested
he
felt
his
cheeks
dragged
back
he
was
unduly
conscious
of
the
weight
of
objects
in
his
pockets
his
stomach
pressed
hard
against
his
backbone
his
sensations
were
those
of
someone
being
struck
a
hard
prolonged
blow
all
over
his
body
it
was
so
startling
a
sensation
though
he
read
about
it
that
he
simply
stayed
still
and
blankly
submitted
to
it
presently
he
felt
himself
gasp
presently
again
he
noticed
that
one
of
his
feet
was
going
to
sleep
he
tried
to
move
it
and
succeeded
only
in
stirring
it
feebly
the
roaring
went
on
and
on
and
on
the
red
letters
in
the
panel
said
stage
ends
in
five
by
the
time
he
read
it
the
rocket
hiccoughed
and
stopped
then
he
felt
a
surge
of
panic
he
was
falling
he
had
no
weight
it
was
the
sensation
of
a
suddenly
dropping
elevator
a
hundred
times
multiplied
he
bounced
out
of
the
depression
in
the
he
was
prevented
from
floating
away
only
by
the
straps
that
held
him
there
was
a
sputter
and
a
series
of
jerks
then
he
had
weight
again
as
roarings
began
once
more
this
was
not
the
ghastly
continued
impact
of
the
but
still
it
was
weight
considerably
greater
weight
than
the
normal
weight
of
earth
cochrane
wiggled
the
foot
that
had
gone
to
sleep
pins
and
needles
lessened
their
annoyance
as
sensation
returned
to
it
he
was
able
to
move
his
arms
and
hands
they
felt
abnormally
heavy
and
he
experienced
an
extreme
and
intolerable
weariness
he
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
this
was
the
the
had
blasted
off
at
six
gravities
acceleration
until
clear
of
atmosphere
and
a
little
more
of
remarkably
effective
design
plus
the
of
one
blood
with
oxygen
made
so
high
an
acceleration
safe
and
not
unendurable
for
the
necessary
length
of
time
it
lasted
now
at
three
gravities
one
did
not
feel
on
the
receiving
end
of
a
violent
thrust
but
one
did
feel
utterly
worn
out
and
spent
most
people
stayed
awake
through
the
stage
and
went
heavily
to
sleep
under
three
gravities
cochrane
fought
the
sensation
of
fatigue
he
had
not
liked
himself
for
accepting
the
orders
that
had
brought
him
here
they
had
been
issued
in
bland
confidence
that
he
had
no
personal
affairs
which
could
not
be
abandoned
to
obey
cryptic
orders
from
the
secretary
of
a
boss
he
had
actually
never
seen
he
felt
a
sort
of
which
it
would
have
been
restful
to
forget
in
sleep
but
he
grimaced
and
held
himself
awake
to
contemplate
the
unpretty
spectacle
of
himself
and
his
actions
the
red
light
said
stage
ends
ten
and
in
ten
seconds
the
rockets
hiccoughed
once
more
and
were
silent
and
there
was
that
sickening
feeling
of
free
fall
but
he
grimly
made
himself
think
of
it
as
soaring
upward
instead
of
dropping
which
was
the
fact
too
and
waited
until
the
rockets
boomed
suddenly
and
went
on
and
on
and
on
this
was
nearly
normal
acceleration
the
effect
of
this
acceleration
was
the
feel
of
nearly
normal
weight
he
felt
about
as
one
would
feel
in
earth
in
a
tilted
back
so
that
one
faced
the
ceiling
he
knew
approximately
where
the
ship
would
be
by
this
time
and
it
ought
to
have
been
a
thrill
cochrane
was
hundreds
of
miles
above
earth
and
headed
eastward
out
and
up
if
a
port
were
open
at
this
height
his
glance
should
span
continents
no
the
ship
had
taken
off
at
night
it
would
still
be
in
shadow
there
would
be
nothing
at
all
to
be
seen
below
unless
one
or
two
small
patches
of
misty
light
which
would
be
earth
great
cities
but
overhead
there
would
be
stars
by
myriads
and
myriads
of
every
possible
color
and
degree
of
brightness
they
would
crowd
each
other
for
room
in
which
to
shine
the
was
spiralling
out
and
out
and
up
and
up
to
keep
its
rendezvous
with
the
space
platform
the
platform
of
course
was
that
artificial
satellite
of
earth
which
was
four
thousand
miles
out
and
went
around
the
planet
in
a
little
over
four
hours
traveling
from
west
to
east
it
had
been
made
because
to
break
the
bonds
of
earth
gravity
was
terribly
costly
in
fuel
when
a
ship
had
to
accelerate
slowly
to
avoid
harm
to
human
cargo
the
space
platform
was
a
filling
station
in
emptiness
at
which
the
would
refuel
for
its
next
and
longer
and
much
less
difficult
journey
of
two
hundred
thousand
miles
the
stewardess
came
up
the
ramp
moving
briskly
she
stopped
and
glanced
at
each
passenger
in
each
chair
in
turn
when
cochrane
turned
his
open
eyes
upon
her
she
said
soothingly
there
no
need
to
be
disturbed
everything
is
going
perfectly
i
not
disturbed
said
cochrane
i
not
even
nervous
i
perfectly
all
right
but
you
should
be
drowsy
she
observed
concerned
most
people
are
if
you
nap
you
feel
better
for
it
she
felt
his
pulse
in
a
businesslike
manner
it
was
normal
take
my
nap
for
me
said
cochrane
or
put
it
back
in
stock
i
want
it
i
perfectly
all
right
she
considered
him
carefully
she
was
remarkably
pretty
but
her
manner
was
strictly
detached
she
said
there
a
button
you
can
reach
it
if
you
need
anything
you
may
call
me
by
pushing
it
he
shrugged
he
lay
still
as
she
went
on
to
inspect
the
other
passengers
there
was
nothing
to
do
and
nothing
to
see
travellers
were
treated
pretty
much
like
parcels
these
days
travel
like
television
entertainment
and
most
of
the
other
facilities
of
human
life
was
designed
for
the
of
the
human
race
whose
likes
and
dislikes
and
predilections
could
be
learned
exactly
by
surveys
anybody
who
did
like
what
everybody
liked
or
did
react
like
everybody
reacted
was
subject
to
annoyances
cochrane
resigned
himself
to
them
the
red
changed
again
considerably
later
this
time
they
said
flight
thirty
they
did
not
say
free
fall
which
was
the
technical
term
for
a
rocket
coasting
upward
or
downward
in
space
but
cochrane
braced
himself
and
his
were
tense
when
the
rockets
stopped
again
and
stayed
off
the
sensation
of
continuous
fall
began
an
electronic
speaker
beside
his
chair
began
to
speak
there
were
other
such
mechanisms
beside
each
other
and
the
interior
of
the
rocket
filled
with
a
soft
murmur
which
was
sardonically
like
choral
recitation
sensation
of
weightlessness
you
now
said
the
voice
soothingly
natural
at
this
stage
of
your
flight
the
ship
has
attained
its
maximum
intended
speed
and
is
still
rising
to
meet
the
space
platform
you
may
consider
that
we
have
left
atmosphere
and
its
limitations
behind
now
we
have
spread
sails
of
inertia
and
glide
on
a
wind
of
pure
momentum
toward
our
destination
the
feeling
of
weightlessness
is
perfectly
normal
you
will
be
greatly
interested
in
the
space
platform
we
will
reach
it
in
something
over
two
hours
of
free
flight
it
is
an
artificial
satellite
with
an
our
ship
will
enter
for
refueling
you
will
be
able
to
leave
the
ship
and
move
about
inside
the
platform
to
lunch
if
you
choose
to
buy
souvenirs
and
mail
them
back
and
to
view
earth
from
a
height
of
four
thousand
miles
through
windows
then
as
now
you
will
feel
no
sensation
of
weight
you
will
be
taken
on
a
tour
of
the
space
platform
if
you
wish
there
are
cochrane
grimly
endured
the
rest
of
the
taped
lecture
he
thought
sourly
to
himself
a
captive
audience
without
even
an
interest
in
the
production
presently
he
saw
bill
holden
head
the
psychiatrist
had
squirmed
inside
the
straps
that
held
him
and
now
was
staring
about
within
the
rocket
his
complexion
was
greenish
i
understand
you
to
brief
me
cochrane
told
him
on
the
way
up
do
you
want
to
tell
me
now
what
all
this
is
about
i
like
a
nice
dramatic
narrative
with
gestures
holden
said
sickly
go
to
hell
wo
you
his
head
disappeared
was
of
course
as
definite
an
ailment
as
seasickness
it
came
from
no
weight
but
cochrane
seemed
to
be
immune
he
turned
his
mind
to
the
possible
purposes
of
his
journey
he
knew
nothing
at
all
his
own
personal
share
in
the
activities
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
the
biggest
advertising
agency
in
the
world
was
the
production
of
the
dikkipatti
hour
television
show
regularly
every
wednesday
night
between
and
central
time
it
was
a
good
show
it
was
among
the
ten
most
popular
shows
on
three
continents
it
was
not
reasonable
that
he
be
ordered
to
drop
it
and
take
orders
from
a
psychiatrist
even
one
he
known
unprofessionally
for
years
but
there
was
not
much
these
days
that
really
made
sense
in
a
world
where
cities
with
populations
of
less
than
five
millions
were
considered
small
towns
values
were
peculiar
one
of
the
deplorable
results
of
living
in
a
world
with
inhabitants
was
that
there
were
too
many
people
and
not
enough
jobs
when
one
had
a
good
job
and
somebody
higher
up
than
oneself
gave
an
order
it
was
obeyed
there
was
always
somebody
else
or
several
somebodies
waiting
for
every
job
there
was
hoping
for
it
maybe
praying
for
it
and
if
a
good
job
was
lost
one
had
to
start
all
over
this
task
might
be
anything
it
was
not
however
connected
in
any
way
with
the
weekly
production
of
the
dikkipatti
hour
and
if
that
production
were
scamped
this
week
because
cochrane
was
away
he
would
be
the
one
to
take
the
loss
in
reputation
the
fact
that
he
was
on
the
moon
would
count
it
would
be
assumed
that
he
was
slipping
and
a
slip
was
not
good
it
was
definitely
not
good
could
do
a
documentary
right
cochrane
told
himself
angrily
i
could
make
a
very
authentic
production
i
got
the
material
he
felt
weight
for
a
moment
it
was
accompanied
by
booming
noises
the
sounds
were
not
in
the
air
outside
because
there
was
no
air
they
were
reverberations
of
the
themselves
transmitted
to
the
fabric
of
the
ship
the
ship
were
correcting
the
course
of
the
vessel
and
yes
there
was
another
surge
of
power
nudging
it
to
a
more
correct
line
of
flight
to
meet
the
space
platform
coming
up
from
behind
the
platform
went
around
the
world
six
times
a
day
four
thousand
miles
out
during
three
of
its
revolutions
anybody
on
the
ground
anywhere
could
spot
it
in
daylight
as
an
infinitesimal
star
bright
enough
to
be
seen
against
the
sky
blueness
rising
in
the
west
and
floating
eastward
to
set
at
the
place
of
sunrise
there
was
again
weightlessness
a
does
burn
its
all
the
time
it
runs
them
to
get
started
and
it
runs
them
to
stop
but
it
does
not
run
them
to
travel
this
ship
was
floating
above
the
earth
which
might
be
a
vast
sunlit
ball
filling
half
the
universe
below
the
rocket
or
might
be
a
blackness
as
of
the
pit
cochrane
had
lost
track
of
time
but
not
of
the
shattering
effect
of
being
snatched
from
the
job
he
knew
and
thought
important
to
travel
incredibly
to
do
something
he
had
no
idea
of
he
felt
in
his
mind
like
somebody
who
climbs
stairs
in
the
dark
and
tries
to
take
a
step
that
is
there
it
was
a
shock
to
find
that
his
work
was
important
even
in
the
eyes
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
that
he
count
that
nothing
counted
there
was
another
dull
booming
outside
and
another
touch
of
weight
then
the
rocket
floated
on
endlessly
a
long
time
later
something
touched
the
ship
outer
hull
it
was
a
definite
positive
clanking
sound
and
then
there
was
the
gentlest
and
vaguest
of
tuggings
and
cochrane
could
feel
the
ship
being
maneuvered
he
knew
it
had
made
contact
with
the
space
platform
and
was
being
drawn
inside
its
lock
there
was
still
no
weight
the
stewardess
began
to
unstrap
the
passengers
one
by
one
supplying
each
with
slippers
cochrane
heard
her
giving
instructions
in
their
use
he
knew
the
was
being
filled
with
air
from
the
huge
globular
platform
in
time
the
door
at
the
back
bottom
base
of
the
opened
somebody
said
flatly
space
platform
the
ship
will
be
in
this
for
some
three
hours
plus
for
refueling
warning
will
be
given
before
departure
passengers
have
the
freedom
of
the
platform
and
will
be
given
every
possible
privilege
the
slippers
did
hold
one
feet
to
the
spiral
ramp
but
one
had
to
hold
on
to
a
to
make
progress
on
the
way
down
to
the
exit
door
cochrane
encountered
babs
she
said
breathlessly
i
ca
believe
i
really
here
i
can
believe
it
said
cochrane
without
even
liking
it
particularly
babs
who
told
you
to
come
on
this
trip
where
all
the
orders
come
from
hopkins
secretary
said
babs
happily
she
did
tell
me
to
come
i
managed
that
she
said
for
me
to
name
two
science
men
and
two
writers
who
could
work
with
you
i
told
her
one
writer
was
more
than
enough
for
any
production
job
but
you
need
me
i
assumed
it
was
a
production
job
so
she
changed
the
orders
and
here
i
am
fine
said
cochrane
his
sense
of
the
ironic
deepened
he
thought
he
was
an
executive
and
reasonably
important
but
somebody
higher
up
than
he
was
had
disposed
of
him
with
finality
and
that
secretary
and
his
own
had
determined
all
the
details
and
he
count
at
all
he
was
a
pawn
in
the
hands
of
and
assorted
secretaries
let
me
know
what
my
job
to
be
and
how
to
do
it
babs
babs
nodded
she
did
catch
the
sarcasm
but
she
could
think
very
straight
just
now
she
was
on
the
space
platform
which
was
the
second
most
glamorous
spot
in
the
universe
the
most
glamorous
spot
of
course
was
the
moon
cochrane
hobbled
ashore
into
the
platform
having
no
weight
whatever
he
was
able
to
move
only
by
the
curious
sticky
adhesion
of
his
slippers
to
the
steel
beneath
him
or
were
they
beneath
there
was
a
crew
member
walking
upside
down
on
a
floor
which
ought
to
be
a
ceiling
directly
over
cochrane
head
he
opened
a
door
in
a
and
went
in
still
upside
down
cochrane
felt
a
sudden
dizziness
at
that
but
he
went
on
using
then
he
saw
william
holden
looking
greenish
and
ill
and
trying
sickishly
to
answer
questions
from
west
and
jamison
and
bell
who
had
been
plucked
from
their
private
lives
just
as
cochrane
had
and
were
now
clamorously
demanding
of
bill
holden
that
he
explain
what
had
happened
to
them
cochrane
snapped
angrily
leave
the
man
alone
he
if
you
get
him
too
much
upset
this
place
will
be
a
mess
holden
closed
his
eyes
and
said
gratefully
shoo
them
away
jed
and
then
come
back
cochrane
waved
his
hands
at
them
they
went
away
stumbling
and
holding
on
to
each
other
in
the
eerie
and
nightmarish
situation
of
there
were
other
passengers
from
the
in
this
great
central
space
of
the
platform
there
was
a
fat
woman
looking
indignantly
at
the
picture
of
a
painted
on
the
wall
somebody
had
painted
it
with
a
pointing
to
zero
pounds
a
sign
said
weight
no
there
was
the
stewardess
from
the
rocket
off
duty
here
she
smoked
a
cigarette
in
the
blast
of
an
electric
fan
there
was
a
party
of
giggling
foolishly
and
clutching
at
everything
and
buying
souvenirs
to
mail
back
to
earth
all
right
bill
said
cochrane
they
gone
now
tell
me
why
all
the
not
inconsiderable
genius
in
the
employ
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
in
my
person
has
been
mobilized
and
sent
up
to
the
moon
bill
holden
swallowed
he
stood
up
with
his
eyes
closed
holding
onto
a
in
the
great
central
room
of
the
platform
i
have
to
keep
my
eyes
shut
he
explained
queasily
it
makes
me
ill
to
see
people
walking
on
and
across
ceilings
a
stout
tourist
was
doing
exactly
that
at
the
moment
if
one
could
walk
anywhere
at
all
with
shoes
one
could
walk
everywhere
the
stout
man
did
walk
up
the
he
adventured
onto
the
ceiling
where
he
was
to
the
balance
of
his
party
he
stood
there
looking
up
down
at
them
and
he
wore
a
peculiarly
astonished
and
and
wholly
foolish
grin
his
wife
squealed
for
him
to
come
down
that
she
could
bear
looking
at
him
so
all
right
said
cochrane
you
keeping
your
eyes
closed
but
supposed
to
take
orders
from
you
what
sort
of
orders
are
you
going
to
give
i
not
sure
yet
said
holden
thinly
we
are
sent
up
here
on
a
private
job
for
hopkins
one
of
your
bosses
hopkins
has
a
daughter
she
married
to
a
man
named
dabney
he
neurotic
he
made
a
great
scientific
discovery
and
it
is
properly
appreciated
so
you
and
i
and
your
team
of
tame
scientists
we
on
our
way
to
the
moon
to
save
his
reason
why
save
his
reason
asked
cochrane
cynically
if
it
makes
him
happy
to
be
a
crackpot
it
does
said
holden
with
his
eyes
still
closed
he
gulped
your
job
and
a
large
part
of
my
practice
depends
on
keeping
him
out
of
a
it
amounts
to
a
job
a
production
with
me
merely
censoring
aspects
that
might
be
bad
for
dabney
psyche
otherwise
he
be
frustrated
are
we
all
demanded
cochrane
who
in
hades
does
he
think
he
is
most
of
us
want
appreciation
but
we
have
to
be
glad
when
we
do
our
work
and
get
paid
for
it
we
then
he
swore
bitterly
he
had
been
taken
off
the
job
he
spent
years
learning
to
do
acceptably
to
phoney
a
personal
satisfaction
for
the
of
one
of
the
partners
of
the
firm
he
worked
for
it
was
humiliation
to
be
considered
merely
a
lackey
who
could
be
ordered
to
perform
personal
services
for
his
boss
without
regard
to
the
damage
to
the
work
he
was
really
responsible
for
it
was
even
more
humiliating
to
know
he
had
to
do
it
because
he
could
afford
not
to
babs
appeared
obviously
gloating
over
the
mere
fact
that
she
was
walking
in
slippers
on
the
steel
decks
of
the
space
platform
her
eyes
were
very
bright
she
said
cochrane
had
you
better
come
look
at
earth
out
of
the
quartz
earthside
windows
why
demanded
cochrane
bitterly
if
it
was
that
i
have
to
hold
onto
something
with
both
hands
in
order
to
do
it
i
be
kicking
myself
why
should
i
want
to
do
tourist
stuff
so
said
babs
so
later
on
you
can
tell
when
a
writer
or
a
scenic
designer
tries
to
put
something
over
on
you
in
a
space
platform
show
cochrane
grimaced
in
theory
i
should
but
do
you
realize
what
all
this
is
about
i
just
learned
when
babs
shook
her
head
he
said
sardonically
we
are
on
the
way
to
the
moon
to
stage
a
private
production
out
of
sheer
cruelty
we
hired
to
rob
a
happy
man
of
the
luxury
of
feeling
sorry
for
himself
we
under
holden
orders
to
cure
a
man
of
being
a
crackpot
babs
hardly
listened
she
was
too
much
filled
with
the
zest
of
being
where
she
never
dared
hope
to
be
able
to
go
i
would
want
to
be
cured
of
being
a
crackpot
protested
cochrane
if
only
i
could
afford
such
a
luxury
i
babs
said
urgently
you
have
to
hurry
really
they
told
me
it
starts
in
ten
minutes
so
i
came
to
find
you
right
away
what
starts
we
in
eclipse
now
explained
babs
we
in
the
earth
shadow
in
about
five
minutes
we
be
coming
out
into
sunlight
again
and
we
see
the
new
earth
guarantee
that
it
will
be
a
new
earth
cochrane
said
morosely
and
i
come
i
did
do
too
well
on
the
old
one
but
he
followed
her
in
all
the
embarrassment
of
walking
on
shoes
in
a
total
absence
of
effective
gravity
it
was
quite
a
job
simply
to
start
off
without
precaution
if
he
merely
tried
to
march
away
from
where
he
was
his
feet
would
walk
out
from
under
him
and
he
be
left
lying
on
his
back
in
again
to
stop
without
putting
one
foot
out
ahead
for
a
prop
would
mean
that
after
his
feet
paused
his
body
would
continue
onward
and
he
would
achieve
a
flop
and
besides
one
could
not
walk
with
a
regular
motion
or
in
seconds
he
would
find
his
feet
churning
emptiness
in
complete
futility
cochrane
tried
to
walk
and
then
irritably
took
a
and
hauled
himself
along
it
with
his
legs
trailing
behind
him
like
the
tail
of
a
swimming
mermaid
he
thought
of
the
simile
and
was
not
impressed
by
his
own
dignity
presently
babs
halted
herself
in
what
was
plainly
a
metal
blister
in
the
outer
skin
of
the
platform
there
was
a
round
quartz
window
showing
the
inside
of
windows
beyond
it
babs
pushed
a
button
marked
and
the
valves
of
steel
drew
back
cochrane
blinked
lifted
even
out
of
his
irritableness
by
the
sight
before
him
he
saw
the
immensity
of
the
heavens
studded
with
innumerable
stars
some
were
brighter
than
others
and
they
were
of
every
imaginable
color
tiny
glintings
of
lurid
tint
through
the
earth
atmosphere
they
would
blend
into
an
indefinite
faint
luminosity
appeared
so
close
together
that
there
seemed
no
possible
interval
however
tiny
the
appearance
of
a
gap
one
had
but
to
look
at
it
for
an
instant
to
perceive
infinitesimal
flecks
of
colored
fire
there
also
each
tiniest
glimmering
was
a
sun
but
that
was
not
what
made
cochrane
catch
his
breath
there
was
a
monstrous
space
of
nothingness
immediately
before
his
eyes
it
was
round
and
vast
and
near
it
was
black
with
the
utter
blackness
of
the
pit
it
was
earth
seen
from
its
shadow
unlighted
even
by
the
moon
there
was
no
faintest
relief
from
its
absolute
darkness
it
was
as
if
in
the
midst
of
the
splendor
of
the
heavens
there
was
a
chasm
through
which
one
glimpsed
the
unthinkable
nothing
from
which
creation
was
called
in
the
beginning
until
one
realized
that
this
was
simply
the
dark
side
of
earth
the
spectacle
was
one
of
horror
after
a
moment
cochrane
said
with
a
carefully
steadied
voice
my
most
disparaging
opinions
of
earth
were
never
as
black
as
this
wait
said
babs
confidently
cochrane
waited
he
had
to
hold
carefully
in
his
mind
that
this
visible
abyss
this
enormity
of
purest
dark
was
not
an
opening
into
nothingness
but
was
simply
earth
at
night
as
seen
from
space
then
he
saw
a
faint
faint
arch
of
color
forming
at
its
edge
it
spread
swiftly
immediately
it
seemed
there
was
a
pinkish
glowing
line
among
the
multitudinous
stars
it
was
red
it
was
very
very
bright
it
became
a
complete
it
was
the
light
of
the
sun
refracted
around
the
edge
of
the
world
within
minutes
it
seemed
in
seconds
the
line
of
light
was
a
glory
among
the
stars
and
then
very
swiftly
the
blazing
orb
which
was
the
sun
appeared
from
behind
earth
it
was
intolerably
bright
but
it
did
not
brighten
the
firmament
it
swam
among
all
the
myriads
of
myriads
of
suns
burning
luridly
and
in
a
terrible
silence
with
visibly
writhing
prominences
rising
from
the
edge
of
its
disk
cochrane
squinted
at
it
with
eyes
then
babs
cried
softly
beautiful
oh
beautiful
and
cochrane
shielded
his
eyes
and
saw
the
world
before
him
the
arc
of
light
became
an
arch
and
then
a
crescent
and
swelled
even
as
he
looked
dawn
flowed
below
the
space
platform
and
it
seemed
that
seas
and
continents
and
clouds
and
beauty
poured
over
the
disk
of
darkness
before
him
he
stood
here
staring
until
the
steel
shutters
slowly
closed
babs
said
in
regret
you
have
to
keep
your
hand
on
the
button
to
keep
the
shutters
open
else
the
window
might
get
pitted
with
dust
cochrane
said
cynically
and
how
much
good
will
it
have
done
me
to
see
that
babs
how
can
that
be
faked
in
a
studio
and
how
much
would
a
television
screen
show
of
it
he
turned
away
then
he
added
sourly
you
stay
and
look
if
you
like
babs
i
already
had
my
vanity
smashed
to
little
bits
if
i
look
at
that
again
i
want
to
weep
in
pure
frustration
because
i
ca
do
anything
even
faintly
as
well
worth
watching
i
prefer
to
cut
down
my
notions
of
the
cosmos
to
a
tolerable
size
but
you
go
ahead
and
look
he
went
back
to
holden
holden
was
painfully
dragging
himself
back
into
the
cochrane
went
with
him
they
returned
weightless
to
the
admirably
designed
in
which
they
had
traveled
to
this
place
and
in
which
they
would
travel
farther
cochrane
settled
down
to
stare
numbly
at
the
wall
above
him
he
had
been
humiliated
enough
by
the
actions
of
one
of
the
heads
of
an
advertising
agency
he
found
himself
resenting
even
as
he
experienced
the
humbling
which
had
been
imposed
upon
him
by
the
cosmos
itself
presently
the
other
passengers
returned
and
the
moonship
was
maneuvered
out
of
the
lock
and
to
emptiness
again
and
again
presently
rockets
roared
and
there
was
further
feeling
of
intolerable
weight
but
it
was
not
as
bad
as
the
from
earth
there
followed
some
hours
of
pure
tedium
after
the
first
accelerating
blasts
the
rockets
were
silent
there
was
no
weight
there
was
nothing
to
hear
except
the
droning
murmur
of
unresting
electric
fans
stirring
the
air
ceaselessly
so
that
excess
moisture
from
breathing
could
be
extracted
by
the
dehumidifiers
but
for
them
if
the
air
had
been
left
stagnant
the
journey
would
have
been
insupportable
there
was
nothing
to
see
because
ports
opening
on
outer
space
were
not
safe
for
passengers
to
look
through
mere
humans
untrained
to
keep
their
minds
on
technical
matters
could
break
down
at
the
spectacle
of
the
universe
there
could
be
no
activity
some
of
the
passengers
took
cochrane
did
not
it
was
against
the
law
for
to
produce
a
sensation
of
euphoria
of
the
law
considered
that
pleasure
might
lead
to
addiction
but
if
a
pill
merely
made
a
person
drowsy
so
that
he
dozed
for
hours
halfway
between
sleeping
and
awake
no
harm
appeared
to
be
done
yet
there
were
plenty
of
addicts
many
people
were
not
especially
anxious
to
feel
good
they
were
quite
satisfied
not
to
feel
anything
at
all
cochrane
could
take
that
way
of
escape
he
lay
strapped
in
his
chair
and
thought
unhappily
of
many
things
he
came
to
feel
unclean
as
people
used
to
feel
when
they
traveled
for
days
on
end
on
railroad
trains
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
bath
one
could
not
even
change
clothes
because
baggage
went
separately
to
the
moon
in
a
robot
which
was
faster
and
cheaper
than
a
passenger
transport
but
would
kill
anybody
who
tried
to
ride
it
acceleration
is
economical
of
fuel
and
is
not
but
nobody
can
live
through
a
from
earth
so
passengers
stayed
in
the
clothes
in
which
they
entered
the
ship
and
the
only
possible
concession
to
fastidiousness
was
the
disposable
underwear
one
could
get
and
change
to
in
the
babs
deane
did
not
take
either
but
cochrane
knew
better
than
to
be
more
than
remotely
friendly
with
her
outside
of
office
hours
he
did
not
want
to
give
her
any
excuse
to
tell
him
anything
for
his
own
good
so
he
spoke
pleasantly
and
kept
company
only
with
his
own
thoughts
but
he
did
notice
that
she
looked
rapt
and
even
through
the
long
and
dreary
hours
of
free
flight
she
was
mentally
tracking
the
moonship
through
the
void
she
know
when
the
continents
of
earth
were
plain
to
see
and
the
tints
of
vegetation
on
the
two
hemispheres
northern
and
southern
and
she
know
when
could
be
seen
and
why
the
stewardess
was
not
too
much
of
a
diversion
she
was
brisk
and
calm
and
soothing
but
she
became
a
trifle
reluctant
to
draw
too
near
the
chairs
in
which
her
passengers
rode
presently
cochrane
made
deductions
and
maliciously
devised
a
television
commercial
in
it
a
stewardess
in
uniform
and
looking
fresh
and
charming
would
say
sweetly
that
she
went
without
bathing
for
days
at
a
time
on
and
did
not
offend
because
she
used
whoosit
antistinkum
and
then
he
thought
pleasurably
of
the
heads
that
would
roll
did
such
a
commercial
actually
get
on
the
air
but
he
did
make
plans
for
the
he
been
sent
to
the
moon
to
do
psychiatry
was
specialized
these
days
as
physical
medicine
had
been
before
it
an
extremely
expensive
diagnostician
had
been
sent
to
the
moon
to
tap
dabney
reflexes
and
he
gravely
diagnosed
frustration
and
suggested
young
holden
for
the
curative
treatment
frustration
was
the
typical
neurosis
of
the
rich
anyhow
and
bill
holden
had
specialized
in
its
cure
his
main
reliance
was
on
the
making
of
a
dramatic
production
centering
about
his
patient
which
was
expensive
enough
and
effective
enough
to
have
made
him
a
quick
reputation
but
he
could
tell
cochrane
what
was
required
of
him
not
yet
he
knew
the
disease
but
not
the
case
he
have
to
see
and
know
dabney
before
he
could
make
use
of
the
his
patient
had
provided
from
the
staff
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
hours
after
from
the
space
platform
the
turned
end
for
end
and
began
to
blast
to
kill
its
velocity
toward
the
moon
it
began
at
the
red
glowing
sign
gave
warning
of
it
and
rose
to
one
gravity
and
then
to
two
after
days
of
two
gravities
was
punishing
cochrane
thought
to
look
at
babs
she
was
rapt
lost
in
picturings
of
what
must
be
outside
the
ship
which
she
could
not
see
she
be
imagining
what
the
television
screens
had
shown
often
enough
from
the
great
pock
marked
face
of
luna
with
its
in
incredible
numbers
and
complexity
and
the
vast
open
seas
which
were
solidified
oceans
of
lava
would
be
clear
to
her
mind
eye
she
would
be
imagining
the
gradual
changes
of
the
moon
face
with
nearness
when
the
colorings
appear
from
a
distance
all
the
moon
seems
tan
or
sandy
in
tint
when
one
comes
closer
there
are
tawny
reds
and
in
the
and
even
blues
and
yellows
and
everywhere
there
is
the
ashy
color
of
the
moondust
glancing
at
her
absorbed
in
her
satisfaction
cochrane
suspected
that
with
only
half
an
excuse
she
would
explain
to
him
how
the
several
hundreds
of
degrees
difference
in
the
of
the
moon
between
midnight
and
noon
made
rocks
split
and
and
fracture
so
that
stuff
as
fine
as
talcum
powder
covered
every
space
not
too
sharply
tilted
for
it
to
rest
on
the
feeling
of
deceleration
increased
for
part
of
a
second
they
had
the
sensation
of
three
gravities
then
there
was
a
curious
yielding
jar
really
very
slight
and
then
the
feeling
of
excess
weight
ended
altogether
but
not
the
feeling
of
weight
they
still
had
weight
it
was
constant
it
was
steady
but
it
was
very
slight
they
were
on
the
moon
but
cochrane
felt
no
elation
in
the
tedious
hours
from
the
space
platform
he
thought
too
much
he
was
actually
aware
of
the
humiliations
and
frustrations
most
men
had
to
conceal
from
themselves
because
they
could
afford
expensive
psychiatric
treatments
frustration
was
the
disease
of
all
humanity
these
days
and
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
about
it
nothing
it
simply
possible
to
rebel
and
rebellion
is
the
process
by
which
humiliation
and
frustration
is
cured
but
one
could
not
rebel
against
the
plain
fact
that
earth
had
more
people
on
it
than
one
planet
could
support
merely
arriving
at
the
moon
did
not
seem
an
especially
useful
achievement
either
to
cochrane
or
to
humanity
at
large
things
looked
bad
chapter
two
cochrane
stood
when
the
stewardess
voice
authorized
the
action
with
sardonic
docility
he
unfastened
his
and
stepped
out
into
the
spiral
descending
aisle
it
seemed
strange
to
have
weight
again
even
as
little
as
this
cochrane
weighed
on
the
moon
just
of
what
he
would
weigh
on
earth
here
he
would
tip
a
at
just
about
pounds
by
flexing
his
toes
he
could
jump
absurdly
he
did
and
he
rose
very
slowly
and
hovered
feeling
singularly
foolish
and
descended
with
a
vast
deliberation
he
landed
on
the
ramp
again
feeling
absurd
indeed
he
saw
babs
grinning
at
him
i
think
said
cochrane
i
have
to
take
up
she
laughed
then
there
were
clankings
and
something
fastened
itself
outside
and
after
a
moment
the
of
the
moonship
opened
they
went
down
the
ramp
to
board
the
holding
onto
the
and
helping
each
other
the
tourist
giggled
foolishly
they
went
out
the
thick
doorway
and
found
themselves
in
an
enclosure
very
much
like
the
interior
of
a
rather
small
submarine
but
it
did
have
shielded
windows
ports
and
babs
instantly
pulled
herself
into
a
seat
beside
one
and
feasted
her
eyes
she
saw
the
jagged
peaks
nearby
and
the
crenelated
wall
miles
off
to
one
side
and
the
smooth
frozen
lava
of
the
sea
across
that
dusty
surface
the
horizon
was
remarkably
near
and
cochrane
remembered
vaguely
that
the
moon
was
only
the
size
of
earth
so
its
horizon
would
naturally
be
nearer
he
glanced
at
the
stars
that
shone
even
through
the
glass
that
denatured
the
sunshine
and
then
he
looked
for
holden
the
psychiatrist
looked
puffy
and
sleepy
and
haggard
and
disheveled
when
a
person
does
have
even
a
little
weight
relieves
the
symptoms
but
the
consequences
last
for
days
do
worry
he
said
sourly
when
he
saw
cochrane
eyes
upon
him
i
wo
waste
any
time
i
find
my
man
and
get
to
work
at
once
just
let
me
get
back
to
earth
there
were
more
clankings
the
sealing
off
from
the
rocket
then
the
vehicle
stirred
the
landscape
outside
began
to
move
they
saw
lunar
city
as
they
approached
it
it
was
five
giant
from
five
feet
in
height
down
to
three
there
were
airlocks
at
their
bases
and
tunnels
connecting
them
and
about
their
sides
but
they
were
which
was
completely
reasonable
there
is
no
air
on
the
moon
by
day
the
sun
shines
down
with
absolute
ferocity
it
heats
everything
as
with
a
at
night
all
heat
radiates
away
to
empty
space
and
the
drops
well
below
that
of
liquid
air
so
lunar
city
was
a
group
of
domes
which
were
essentially
hemispheres
of
plastic
brought
from
earth
and
inflated
and
covered
with
dust
with
airlocks
to
permit
entrance
and
exit
they
were
inhabitable
they
needed
no
framework
to
support
them
because
there
were
no
stormwinds
or
earthquakes
to
put
stresses
on
them
they
needed
neither
heating
nor
cooling
equipment
they
were
buried
under
forty
feet
of
with
vacuum
between
the
lunar
city
was
not
beautiful
but
human
beings
could
live
in
it
the
carried
them
a
bare
half
mile
and
they
alighted
inside
a
lock
and
another
door
and
another
opened
and
closed
and
they
emerged
into
a
scene
which
no
amount
of
television
could
really
portray
the
main
dome
was
a
thousand
feet
across
and
half
as
high
there
were
green
plants
growing
in
tubs
and
pots
and
the
air
was
fresh
it
smelled
strange
there
could
be
no
vegetation
on
the
rocket
and
it
seemed
new
and
blissful
to
breathe
really
freshened
air
after
days
of
the
canned
variety
but
this
freshness
made
cochrane
realize
that
he
feel
better
for
a
bath
he
took
a
shower
in
his
hotel
room
the
room
was
very
much
like
one
on
earth
except
that
it
had
no
windows
but
the
shower
was
strange
the
sprays
were
tiny
cochrane
felt
as
if
he
were
being
sprayed
by
atomizers
rather
than
until
he
noticed
that
water
ran
off
him
very
slowly
and
realized
that
a
normal
shower
would
have
been
overwhelming
he
scooped
up
a
handful
of
water
and
let
it
drop
it
took
a
full
second
to
fall
two
and
a
half
feet
it
was
unsettling
but
fresh
clothing
from
his
waiting
baggage
made
him
feel
better
he
went
to
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
and
it
was
not
a
lounge
and
the
hotel
was
not
a
hotel
everything
in
the
dome
was
indoors
in
the
sense
that
it
was
under
a
globular
ceiling
fifty
stories
high
but
everything
was
also
in
the
sense
of
bright
light
and
growing
trees
and
bushes
and
shrubs
he
found
babs
freshly
garmented
and
waiting
for
him
she
said
in
businesslike
tones
cochrane
i
asked
at
the
desk
doctor
holden
has
gone
to
consult
dabney
he
asked
that
we
stay
within
call
i
sent
word
to
west
and
jamison
and
mr
bell
cochrane
approved
of
her
secretarial
efficiency
then
we
sit
somewhere
and
wait
since
this
is
an
office
find
some
refreshment
they
asked
for
a
table
and
got
one
near
the
swimming
pool
and
babs
wore
her
office
manner
all
crispness
and
business
until
they
were
seated
but
this
swimming
pool
was
not
like
a
pool
on
earth
the
water
was
deeply
sunk
beneath
the
pool
rim
and
great
waves
surged
back
and
forth
the
swimmers
babs
gasped
a
man
stood
on
a
board
quite
thirty
feet
above
the
water
he
prepared
to
dive
that
johnny
simms
she
said
awed
who
he
the
playboy
said
babs
staring
he
a
psychopathic
personality
and
his
family
has
millions
they
keep
him
up
here
out
of
trouble
married
too
bad
if
he
has
millions
said
cochrane
i
would
marry
a
man
with
a
psychopathic
personality
protested
babs
keep
away
from
people
in
the
advertising
business
then
cochrane
told
her
johnny
simms
did
not
jounce
up
and
down
on
the
diving
board
to
start
he
simply
leaped
upward
and
went
ceilingward
for
easily
fifteen
feet
and
hung
stationary
for
a
full
breath
and
then
began
to
descend
in
literal
slow
motion
he
fell
only
two
and
a
half
feet
the
first
second
and
five
feet
more
the
one
after
and
twelve
and
a
half
after
that
it
took
him
over
four
seconds
to
drop
feet
into
the
water
and
the
splash
that
arose
when
he
struck
the
surface
rose
four
yards
and
subsided
with
a
lunatic
deliberation
watching
babs
could
not
keep
her
businesslike
demeanor
she
was
bursting
with
the
joyous
knowledge
that
she
was
on
the
moon
seeing
the
impossible
and
looking
at
fame
they
sipped
at
drinks
but
the
liquid
rose
much
too
swiftly
in
the
straws
and
cochrane
reflected
that
the
drink
in
babs
glass
would
cost
dabney
as
much
as
babs
earned
in
a
week
back
home
and
his
own
was
costing
no
less
presently
a
written
note
came
from
holden
send
west
and
jamison
right
away
to
dabney
lunar
laboratory
to
get
details
of
discovery
from
man
named
jones
get
and
driver
from
hotel
i
will
want
you
in
an
i
be
back
said
cochrane
wait
he
left
the
table
and
found
west
and
jamison
in
bell
room
all
three
in
conference
over
a
bottle
west
and
jamison
were
cochrane
scientific
team
for
the
yet
unformulated
task
he
was
to
perform
west
was
the
popularizing
specialist
he
could
make
a
television
audience
believe
that
it
understood
all
the
seven
dimensions
required
for
some
branches
of
theory
his
explanation
did
not
stick
of
course
one
did
remember
them
but
they
were
singularly
convincing
in
cultural
episodes
on
television
productions
jamison
was
the
prophecy
expert
he
could
extrapolate
anything
into
anything
else
and
make
you
believe
that
a
drop
in
the
birthdate
on
kamchatka
was
the
beginning
of
a
trend
that
would
leave
the
earth
depopulated
in
exactly
four
hundred
and
years
they
were
good
men
for
a
television
producer
to
have
on
call
now
instructed
they
went
out
to
be
briefed
by
somebody
who
undoubtedly
knew
more
than
both
of
them
put
together
but
whom
they
would
regard
with
tolerant
suspicion
bell
left
behind
said
cagily
this
script
i
got
to
do
now
will
that
laboratory
be
the
set
where
is
it
in
the
dome
it
not
in
the
dome
cochrane
told
him
west
and
jamison
took
a
to
get
to
it
i
do
know
what
the
set
will
be
i
do
know
anything
yet
i
waiting
to
be
told
about
the
job
myself
if
i
got
to
cook
up
a
observed
bell
i
have
to
know
the
set
who
act
you
know
how
amateurs
can
ham
up
any
script
how
about
a
part
for
babs
nice
kid
cochrane
found
himself
annoyed
without
knowing
why
we
just
have
to
wait
until
we
know
what
our
job
is
he
said
curtly
and
turned
to
go
bell
said
one
more
thing
if
you
planning
to
use
a
news
cameraman
up
here
do
i
used
to
be
a
cameraman
before
i
got
crazy
and
started
to
write
let
me
do
the
i
got
a
better
idea
of
using
a
camera
to
tell
a
story
now
than
hold
it
said
cochrane
we
not
up
here
to
a
show
our
job
is
psychiatry
craziness
to
a
producer
a
psychiatric
production
would
seem
craziness
a
might
have
trouble
writing
out
a
psychiatrist
prescription
or
he
might
not
but
producing
it
would
be
out
of
all
rationality
no
camera
the
patient
would
be
the
star
and
most
lines
would
be
ad
libbed
cochrane
viewed
such
a
production
with
extreme
distaste
but
of
course
if
a
man
wanted
only
to
be
famous
it
might
be
handled
as
a
straight
job
in
any
case
though
it
would
amount
to
flattery
in
three
dimensions
and
cochrane
would
rather
have
no
part
in
it
but
he
had
to
arrange
the
whole
thing
he
went
back
to
the
table
and
rejoined
babs
she
confided
that
been
talking
to
johnny
simms
wife
she
was
nice
but
homesick
cochrane
sat
down
and
thought
morbid
thoughts
then
he
realized
that
he
was
irritated
because
babs
did
notice
he
finished
his
drink
and
ordered
another
half
an
hour
later
holden
found
them
he
had
in
tow
a
youngish
man
with
a
remarkably
narrow
forehead
and
an
expression
of
deep
anxiety
cochrane
winced
a
neurotic
type
if
there
ever
was
one
jed
said
holden
heartily
here
dabney
dabney
jed
cochrane
is
here
as
a
specialist
in
he
take
charge
of
this
affair
your
sent
him
up
here
to
see
that
you
are
done
justice
to
dabney
seemed
to
think
earnestly
before
he
spoke
it
is
not
for
myself
he
explained
in
an
anxious
tone
it
is
my
work
that
is
important
after
all
this
is
a
fundamental
scientific
discovery
but
nobody
pays
any
attention
it
is
extremely
important
extremely
science
itself
is
held
back
by
the
lack
of
attention
paid
to
my
discovery
which
holden
assured
him
is
about
to
be
changed
it
a
matter
of
public
relations
jed
a
specialist
he
take
over
the
young
man
held
up
his
hand
for
attention
he
thought
visibly
then
he
said
worriedly
i
would
take
you
over
to
my
laboratory
but
i
promised
my
wife
i
would
call
her
in
half
an
hour
from
now
johnny
simms
wife
just
reminded
me
my
wife
is
back
on
earth
so
you
will
have
to
go
to
the
laboratory
without
me
and
have
jones
show
you
the
proof
of
my
work
a
very
intelligent
man
jones
in
a
subordinate
way
of
course
yes
i
will
get
you
a
jeep
and
you
can
go
there
at
once
and
when
you
come
back
you
can
tell
me
what
you
plan
but
you
understand
that
it
is
not
for
myself
that
i
want
credit
it
is
my
discovery
it
is
terribly
important
it
is
vital
it
must
not
be
overlooked
holden
escorted
him
away
while
cochrane
carefully
controlled
his
features
after
a
few
moments
holden
came
back
his
face
sagging
this
your
drink
jed
he
asked
dispiritedly
i
need
it
he
picked
up
the
glass
and
emptied
it
the
history
of
that
case
would
be
interesting
if
one
could
really
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
come
along
his
tone
was
dreariness
itself
i
got
a
jeep
waiting
for
us
babs
stood
up
her
eyes
shining
may
i
come
mr
cochrane
cochrane
waved
her
along
holden
tried
to
stalk
gloomily
but
nobody
can
stalk
in
gravity
he
reeled
and
then
depressedly
accommodated
himself
to
conditions
on
the
moon
there
was
an
airlock
with
a
smaller
edition
of
the
that
had
brought
them
from
the
ship
to
the
city
it
was
a
metal
body
raised
some
ten
feet
off
the
ground
on
outrageously
large
wheels
it
was
very
similar
to
the
used
in
lumberyards
on
earth
it
would
straddle
boulders
in
its
path
it
could
go
anywhere
in
spite
of
dust
and
detritus
and
its
metal
body
was
and
held
air
for
breathing
even
out
on
the
moon
surface
they
climbed
in
there
was
the
sound
of
pumping
which
grew
fainter
the
outer
opened
the
rolled
outside
babs
stared
with
passionate
rapture
out
of
a
shielded
port
there
were
impossibly
jagged
stones
preposterously
steep
cliffs
there
had
been
no
weather
to
remove
the
sharp
edge
of
anything
in
a
hundred
million
years
the
vehicle
trundled
over
the
lava
sea
toward
the
rampart
of
mighty
mountains
towering
over
lunar
city
it
reached
a
steep
ascent
it
climbed
and
the
way
was
remarkably
rough
and
the
vehicle
springless
but
it
was
nevertheless
a
cushioned
ride
a
bump
can
not
be
harsh
in
light
gravity
the
vehicle
rode
as
if
on
wings
all
right
said
cochrane
tell
me
the
worst
what
the
trouble
with
him
is
he
the
result
of
six
generations
of
keeping
the
money
in
the
family
or
is
he
a
freak
holden
groaned
a
little
he
practically
a
stock
model
of
a
rich
young
man
without
brains
enough
for
a
job
in
the
family
firm
and
too
much
money
for
anything
else
fortunately
for
his
family
he
did
react
like
johnny
simms
though
they
good
friends
a
hundred
years
ago
dabney
have
gone
in
for
the
arts
but
it
hard
to
fool
yourself
that
way
now
fifty
years
ago
he
have
gone
in
for
sociology
but
we
really
are
doing
the
best
that
can
be
done
with
too
many
people
and
not
enough
world
so
he
went
in
for
science
it
incapacity
does
show
up
but
he
has
stumbled
on
something
it
sounds
really
important
it
must
have
been
an
accident
the
only
trouble
is
that
it
does
mean
a
thing
yet
because
he
accomplished
more
than
he
ever
expected
to
he
frustrated
because
it
not
appreciated
what
a
joke
cochrane
said
cynically
you
paint
a
dark
picture
bill
are
you
trying
to
make
this
thing
into
a
challenge
you
ca
make
a
man
famous
for
discovering
something
that
matter
said
holden
hopelessly
and
this
is
that
nothing
impossible
to
public
relations
if
you
spend
enough
money
cochrane
assured
him
what
this
useless
triumph
of
his
the
jeep
bounced
over
a
small
cliff
and
fell
gently
for
half
a
second
and
rolled
on
babs
beamed
he
found
said
holden
discouragedly
a
way
to
send
messages
faster
than
light
it
a
detour
around
einstein
stuff
not
denying
it
but
evading
it
right
now
it
takes
not
quite
two
seconds
for
a
message
to
go
from
the
moon
to
earth
that
at
the
speed
of
light
dabney
has
proof
we
see
it
that
he
can
cut
that
down
some
per
cent
only
it
ca
be
used
for
communication
because
both
ends
have
to
be
in
a
vacuum
it
could
be
used
to
the
space
platform
but
what
the
difference
it
a
real
discovery
for
which
there
no
possible
use
there
no
place
to
send
messages
to
cochrane
eyes
grew
bright
and
hard
there
were
some
three
thousand
million
suns
in
the
immediate
locality
of
earth
and
more
only
a
relatively
short
distance
way
and
it
had
not
mattered
to
anybody
the
situation
did
not
seem
likely
to
change
but
the
climbed
and
climbed
it
was
a
mile
above
the
bay
of
the
lava
sea
and
the
that
were
a
city
it
looked
like
ten
miles
because
of
the
curve
of
the
horizon
the
mountains
all
about
looked
like
a
madman
dream
but
he
wants
appreciation
said
holden
angrily
people
on
earth
almost
trampling
on
each
other
for
lack
of
room
and
people
like
me
trying
to
keep
them
sane
when
they
every
reason
for
despair
and
he
wants
appreciation
cochrane
grinned
he
whistled
softly
never
underestimate
a
genius
bill
he
said
kindly
i
refer
modestly
to
myself
in
two
weeks
your
patient
i
guarantee
it
will
be
acclaimed
the
hope
the
blessing
the
greatest
man
in
all
the
history
of
humanity
it
be
phoney
of
course
but
we
have
marilyn
winters
little
aphrodite
herself
making
passes
at
him
in
hopes
of
a
publicity
break
it
a
natural
how
you
do
it
demanded
holden
the
turned
in
its
crazy
bumping
progress
a
flat
area
had
been
blasted
in
rock
which
had
been
unchanged
since
the
beginning
of
time
here
there
was
a
human
structure
typically
it
was
a
leaning
against
a
cliff
there
was
an
airlock
and
another
jeep
waited
outside
and
there
were
eccentric
metal
devices
on
the
flat
space
shielded
from
direct
sunshine
and
with
cables
running
to
them
from
the
airlock
door
how
repeated
cochrane
i
get
the
details
here
let
go
how
do
we
manage
it
was
a
matter
he
discovered
of
and
they
were
tricky
to
get
into
and
felt
horrible
when
one
was
in
struggling
cochrane
thought
to
say
you
can
wait
here
in
the
jeep
babs
but
she
was
already
climbing
into
a
suit
very
much
oversized
for
her
with
the
look
of
high
excitement
that
cochrane
had
forgotten
anybody
could
wear
they
got
out
of
a
tiny
airlock
that
held
just
one
person
at
a
time
they
started
for
the
laboratory
and
suddenly
cochrane
saw
babs
staring
upward
through
the
dark
glass
that
a
needs
in
the
moon
daytime
if
its
occupant
is
to
be
fried
by
sunlight
cochrane
automatically
glanced
up
too
he
saw
earth
it
hung
almost
in
it
was
huge
it
was
gigantic
it
was
colossal
it
was
four
times
the
diameter
of
the
moon
as
seen
from
earth
and
it
covered
sixteen
times
as
much
of
the
sky
its
continents
were
plain
to
see
and
its
seas
and
the
at
its
poles
gleamed
whitely
and
over
all
of
it
there
was
a
faintly
bluish
haze
which
was
like
a
glamour
a
fey
and
eerie
veiling
which
made
earth
a
sight
to
draw
at
one
behind
it
and
all
about
it
there
was
the
background
of
space
so
thickly
jeweled
with
stars
that
there
seemed
no
room
for
another
tiny
gem
cochrane
looked
he
said
nothing
holden
stumbled
on
to
the
airlock
he
remembered
to
hold
the
door
open
for
babs
and
then
there
was
the
interior
of
the
laboratory
it
was
not
wholly
familiar
even
to
cochrane
who
had
used
sets
on
the
dikkipatti
hour
of
most
of
the
locations
in
which
human
dramas
can
unfold
this
was
a
physics
laboratory
pure
and
simple
the
air
smelled
of
ozone
and
spilled
acid
and
oil
and
food
and
and
other
items
west
and
jamison
were
already
here
their
removed
they
sat
before
beer
at
a
table
with
innumerable
diagrams
scattered
about
there
was
a
man
rather
impatiently
turning
to
face
his
new
visitors
holden
clumsily
unfastened
the
of
his
helmet
and
gloomily
explained
his
mission
he
introduced
cochrane
and
babs
verifying
in
the
process
that
the
dark
man
was
the
jones
he
had
come
to
see
a
physics
laboratory
high
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
lunar
apennines
is
an
odd
place
for
a
psychiatrist
to
introduce
himself
on
professional
business
but
holden
only
explained
unhappily
that
dabney
had
sent
them
to
learn
about
his
discovery
and
arrange
for
a
job
to
make
it
known
cochrane
saw
jones
expression
flicker
sarcastically
just
once
during
holden
explanation
otherwise
he
was
i
was
explaining
the
discovery
to
these
two
he
observed
shoot
it
said
cochrane
to
west
it
was
reasonable
to
ask
west
for
an
explanation
because
he
would
translate
everything
into
televisable
terms
west
said
briskly
exactly
as
if
before
a
television
camera
that
dabney
had
started
from
the
fact
that
the
properties
of
space
are
modified
by
energy
fields
magnetic
and
gravitational
and
electrostatic
fields
rotate
polarized
light
or
bend
light
or
do
this
or
that
as
the
case
may
be
but
all
previous
modifications
of
the
constants
of
space
had
been
in
essentially
spherical
fields
all
previous
fields
had
extended
in
all
directions
increasing
in
intensity
as
the
square
of
the
distance
cut
said
cochrane
west
automatically
abandoned
his
professional
delivery
he
placidly
himself
to
his
beer
how
about
it
jones
asked
cochrane
dabney
got
a
variation
what
is
it
it
a
field
of
force
that
does
spread
out
you
set
up
two
plates
and
establish
this
field
between
them
said
jones
curtly
circularly
polarized
and
it
does
expand
it
like
a
searchlight
beam
or
a
microwave
beam
and
it
stays
the
same
size
like
a
pipe
in
that
field
or
pipe
radiation
travels
faster
than
it
does
outside
the
properties
of
space
are
changed
between
the
plates
therefore
the
speed
of
all
radiation
that
all
cochrane
meditatively
seated
himself
he
approved
of
this
jones
whose
eyebrows
practically
met
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
he
was
not
more
polite
than
politeness
required
he
did
not
express
rapture
at
the
mention
of
his
employer
name
but
what
can
be
done
with
it
asked
cochrane
practically
nothing
said
jones
succinctly
it
changes
the
properties
of
space
but
that
all
can
you
think
of
any
use
for
a
i
ca
cochrane
cocked
an
eye
at
jamison
who
could
extrapolate
at
the
drop
of
an
equation
but
jamison
shook
his
head
communication
between
planets
he
said
morosely
when
we
get
to
them
chats
between
sweethearts
on
earth
and
pluto
broadcasts
to
the
stars
when
we
find
that
another
one
set
up
a
similar
plate
and
is
ready
to
chat
with
us
there
nothing
else
cochrane
waved
his
hand
it
is
good
policy
to
put
a
specialist
in
his
place
occasionally
demonstration
he
asked
jones
there
are
plates
across
the
crater
out
yonder
said
jones
without
emotion
twenty
miles
clear
reach
i
can
send
a
message
across
and
get
it
relayed
twice
and
back
through
two
angles
in
about
five
per
cent
of
the
time
radiation
ought
to
take
cochrane
said
with
benign
cynicism
jamison
you
work
by
guessing
where
you
can
go
jones
works
by
guessing
where
he
is
but
this
is
a
public
relations
job
i
do
know
where
we
are
or
where
we
can
go
but
i
know
where
we
want
to
take
this
thing
jones
looked
at
him
not
hostilely
but
with
the
detached
interest
of
a
man
accustomed
to
nearly
exact
science
when
he
watches
somebody
work
in
one
of
the
least
precise
of
them
all
holden
said
you
mean
you
worked
out
some
sort
of
production
no
production
said
cochrane
blandly
it
is
necessary
a
straight
we
concoct
a
story
and
then
let
it
leak
out
we
make
it
so
good
that
even
the
people
who
do
believe
it
ca
help
spreading
it
he
nodded
at
jamison
right
now
jamison
we
want
a
theory
that
the
sending
of
radiation
at
twenty
times
the
speed
of
light
means
that
there
is
a
way
to
send
matter
faster
than
light
as
soon
as
we
work
it
out
it
means
that
the
which
increases
with
speed
einstein
stuff
is
not
a
property
of
matter
but
of
space
just
as
the
that
increases
when
an
airplane
goes
faster
is
a
property
of
air
and
not
of
the
plane
maybe
we
need
to
work
out
a
theory
that
all
inertia
is
a
property
of
space
we
see
if
we
need
that
but
anyhow
just
as
a
plane
can
go
faster
in
thin
air
so
matter
any
matter
will
move
faster
in
this
field
as
soon
as
we
get
the
trick
of
it
you
see
holden
shook
his
head
what
that
got
in
it
to
make
dabney
famous
he
asked
jamison
will
extrapolate
from
there
cochrane
assured
him
go
ahead
jamison
you
on
jamison
said
promptly
with
the
hypnotic
smoothness
of
the
practiced
professional
when
this
development
has
been
completed
not
only
will
messages
be
sent
at
multiples
of
the
speed
of
light
but
matter
ships
the
barrier
to
the
high
destiny
of
mankind
the
limitation
of
our
race
to
a
single
planet
of
a
minor
sun
these
handicaps
crash
and
will
shatter
as
the
great
minds
of
humanity
bend
their
efforts
to
make
the
dabney
principle
the
operative
principle
of
our
ships
there
are
thousands
of
millions
of
suns
in
our
galaxy
and
not
less
than
one
in
three
has
planets
and
among
these
myriads
of
unknown
worlds
there
will
be
thousands
with
seas
and
land
and
clouds
and
continents
fit
for
men
to
enter
upon
there
to
rear
their
cities
there
will
be
starships
roaming
distant
and
landing
on
planets
in
the
milky
way
we
ourselves
will
see
to
rigel
and
arcturus
and
journey
on
singing
through
the
void
to
andromeda
and
aldebaran
dabney
has
made
the
first
breach
in
the
barrier
to
the
illimitable
greatness
of
humanity
then
he
stopped
and
said
professionally
i
can
polish
that
up
a
bit
of
course
all
right
fair
conceded
cochrane
he
turned
to
holden
how
about
a
job
on
that
order
wo
that
sort
of
publicity
meet
the
requirements
will
your
patient
be
satisfied
with
that
grade
of
appreciation
holden
drew
a
deep
breath
he
said
unsteadily
as
a
neurotic
personality
he
wo
require
that
it
be
true
all
want
is
the
seeming
but
jed
could
it
be
really
true
could
it
cochrane
laughed
unpleasantly
he
did
not
admire
himself
his
laughter
showed
it
what
do
you
want
he
demanded
you
got
me
a
job
i
did
want
you
shoved
it
down
my
throat
now
there
the
way
to
get
it
done
what
more
can
you
ask
holden
winced
then
he
said
heavily
i
like
for
it
to
be
true
jones
moved
suddenly
he
said
in
an
oddly
surprised
voice
know
it
can
be
i
did
realize
it
can
be
true
i
can
make
a
ship
go
faster
than
light
cochrane
said
with
exquisite
irony
thanks
but
we
do
need
it
we
are
getting
paid
for
that
all
we
need
is
a
modicum
of
appreciation
for
a
neurotic
of
a
partner
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
a
job
is
all
that
required
you
give
west
the
theory
and
jamison
will
do
the
prophecy
and
bell
will
write
it
out
jones
said
calmly
i
will
like
hell
look
i
discovered
this
field
in
the
first
place
i
sold
it
to
dabney
because
he
wanted
to
be
famous
i
got
my
pay
and
he
can
keep
it
but
if
he
ca
understand
it
himself
even
to
lecture
about
it
do
you
think
i
going
to
throw
in
some
extra
stuff
i
noticed
that
i
can
fit
into
that
theory
but
nobody
else
can
do
you
think
i
going
to
give
him
starships
as
a
bonus
holden
said
nodding
with
his
lips
twisted
i
should
have
figured
that
he
bought
his
great
discovery
from
you
eh
and
that
what
he
gets
frustrated
about
cochrane
snapped
i
thought
you
psychiatrists
knew
the
facts
of
life
bill
dabney
not
unusual
in
my
business
he
almost
a
typical
sponsor
when
you
ask
me
to
throw
away
starships
said
jones
coldly
for
a
publicity
feature
i
do
play
i
wo
take
the
credit
for
the
field
away
from
dabney
i
sold
him
that
with
my
eyes
open
but
starships
are
more
important
than
a
fool
hankering
to
be
famous
he
never
try
it
he
be
afraid
it
would
work
i
do
play
holden
said
stridently
i
do
give
a
damn
about
any
deal
you
made
with
dabney
but
if
you
can
get
us
to
the
stars
all
us
humans
who
need
it
you
got
to
jones
said
again
calmly
i
willing
make
me
an
offer
not
cash
but
a
chance
to
do
something
real
not
just
a
trick
for
a
neurotic
ego
cochrane
grinned
at
him
very
peculiarly
i
like
your
approach
you
got
illusions
they
nice
things
to
have
i
would
mind
having
some
myself
bill
he
said
to
william
holden
how
much
nerve
has
dabney
speaking
unprofessionally
said
holden
he
a
worm
with
wants
he
has
anything
but
cravings
why
cochrane
grinned
again
his
head
cocked
on
one
side
he
would
take
part
in
an
enterprise
to
reach
the
stars
would
he
when
holden
shook
his
head
cochrane
said
zestfully
i
guess
that
the
peak
of
his
ambition
would
be
to
have
the
credit
for
it
if
it
worked
but
he
would
risk
being
associated
with
it
until
it
had
worked
right
right
said
holden
i
said
he
was
a
worm
what
you
driving
at
i
outlining
what
you
twisting
my
arm
to
make
me
do
said
cochrane
in
case
you
have
noticed
bill
if
jones
can
really
make
a
ship
go
faster
than
light
i
can
repeated
jones
i
simply
did
think
of
the
thing
in
connection
with
travel
i
only
thought
of
it
for
signalling
then
said
cochrane
i
literally
forced
for
dabney
sake
to
do
something
that
he
scream
shrilly
at
if
he
heard
about
it
we
going
to
have
a
party
bill
a
party
after
your
and
my
and
jones
hearts
what
do
you
mean
demanded
holden
we
make
a
production
after
all
said
cochrane
grinning
we
are
going
to
take
dabney
discovery
the
one
he
bought
publicity
rights
to
very
seriously
indeed
i
going
to
get
him
acclaim
first
we
break
a
story
of
what
dabney
field
means
for
the
future
of
mankind
and
then
we
prove
it
we
take
a
journey
to
the
stars
want
to
make
your
reservations
now
you
mean
said
west
incredulously
a
genuine
trip
why
cochrane
snapped
at
him
suddenly
because
i
ca
kid
myself
any
more
he
rasped
i
found
out
how
little
i
count
in
the
world
and
the
estimation
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
i
found
out
i
only
a
little
man
when
i
thought
i
was
a
big
one
and
i
wo
take
it
now
i
got
an
excuse
to
try
to
be
a
big
man
that
reason
enough
is
it
then
he
glared
around
the
small
laboratory
under
the
he
was
irritated
because
he
did
not
feel
splendid
emotions
after
making
a
resolution
and
a
plan
which
ought
to
go
down
in
history
if
it
worked
he
was
uplifted
he
was
aware
of
any
particular
feeling
of
being
the
instrument
of
destiny
or
anything
else
he
simply
felt
peevish
and
annoyed
and
obstinate
about
trying
the
impossible
trick
it
annoyed
him
additionally
perhaps
to
see
the
expression
of
admiration
on
babs
face
as
she
looked
at
him
across
the
untidy
laboratory
table
cluttered
up
with
chapter
three
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
the
american
continents
were
discovered
because
were
unknown
in
the
fifteenth
century
there
being
no
refrigeration
meat
did
not
keep
but
meat
was
not
too
easy
to
come
by
so
it
had
to
be
eaten
even
when
it
stank
therefore
it
was
a
noble
enterprise
and
to
the
glory
of
the
kingdoms
of
castile
and
aragon
to
put
up
the
financial
backing
for
even
a
crackpot
who
might
get
spices
cheaper
and
thereby
make
the
consumption
of
slightly
spoiled
meat
less
unpleasant
which
was
why
columbus
got
three
ships
and
crews
of
jailbirds
for
them
from
a
government
still
busy
trying
to
drive
the
moors
out
of
the
last
corner
of
spain
this
was
a
precedent
for
the
matter
on
hand
now
cochrane
happened
to
know
the
details
about
columbus
because
he
checked
over
the
research
when
he
did
a
show
on
the
dikkipatti
hour
dealing
with
him
there
were
more
precedents
the
elaborate
bargain
by
which
columbus
was
to
be
made
hereditary
high
admiral
of
the
western
oceans
with
a
bite
of
all
revenue
obtained
by
the
passage
he
was
to
discover
he
had
to
hold
out
for
such
terms
to
make
the
package
he
was
selling
look
attractive
nobody
buys
anything
that
is
underpriced
too
much
it
looks
phoney
so
cochrane
made
his
preliminaries
rather
more
impressive
than
they
need
have
been
from
a
strictly
practical
point
of
view
in
order
to
make
the
enterprise
practical
from
a
financial
aspect
there
was
another
precedent
he
did
not
intend
to
follow
columbus
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
when
he
set
sail
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
when
he
arrived
at
the
end
of
his
voyage
and
he
did
know
where
he
been
when
he
got
back
cochrane
expected
to
improve
on
the
achievement
of
the
earlier
explorer
doings
in
these
respects
he
commandeered
the
legal
department
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
to
set
up
the
enterprise
with
strict
legality
and
discretion
there
came
into
being
a
corporation
called
spaceways
which
could
not
possibly
be
considered
phoney
from
any
inspection
of
its
charter
expert
legal
advice
arranged
that
its
actual
should
appear
to
be
untraceable
deft
manipulation
contrived
that
though
its
stock
was
legally
vested
in
cochrane
and
holden
and
jones
cochrane
negligently
threw
in
jones
as
a
convenient
name
to
use
and
they
were
officially
the
owners
of
nearly
all
the
stock
nobody
who
checked
up
would
believe
they
were
anything
but
dummies
stockholdings
in
west
and
jamison
and
bell
names
would
look
like
smaller
holdings
held
for
other
than
the
main
entrepreneurs
but
these
were
not
only
the
legal
owners
of
record
they
were
the
true
owners
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
wanted
no
actual
part
of
spaceways
they
considered
the
enterprise
merely
a
psychiatric
treatment
for
a
neurotic
which
of
course
it
was
so
spaceways
quite
honestly
and
validly
belonged
to
the
people
who
would
cure
dabney
of
his
frustration
and
nobody
at
all
believed
that
it
would
ever
do
anything
else
not
anybody
but
those
six
owners
anyhow
and
as
it
turned
out
not
all
of
them
the
psychiatric
treatment
began
with
an
from
lunar
city
saying
that
dabney
the
scientist
had
consented
to
act
as
consulting
physicist
to
spaceways
for
the
practical
application
of
his
recent
discovery
of
a
way
to
send
messages
faster
than
light
this
was
news
simply
because
it
came
from
the
moon
it
got
fairly
wide
distribution
but
no
emphasis
then
the
publicity
campaign
broke
on
orders
from
cochrane
jamison
the
extrapolating
genius
got
slightly
plastered
in
company
with
the
two
reporters
in
lunar
city
he
confided
that
spaceways
had
been
organized
and
was
backed
to
develop
the
dabney
field
into
a
field
the
news
men
pumped
him
of
all
his
extrapolations
cynically
they
checked
to
see
who
might
be
preparing
to
unload
stock
they
found
no
preparations
for
no
registration
of
the
company
for
raising
funds
it
was
going
to
the
public
for
money
it
selling
anybody
anything
then
cochrane
refused
to
see
any
reporters
at
all
everybody
connected
with
the
enterprise
shut
up
tighter
than
a
clam
and
jamison
vanished
into
a
hotel
room
where
he
was
kept
occupied
with
beverages
and
food
at
dabney
expense
none
of
this
was
standard
for
a
phoney
promotion
deal
the
news
story
exploded
let
loose
on
an
overcrowded
planet
which
had
lost
all
hope
of
relief
after
fifty
years
in
which
only
the
moon
had
been
colonized
and
its
colony
had
a
population
in
the
hundreds
only
the
idea
of
travel
was
the
one
impossible
dream
that
everybody
wanted
to
believe
in
the
story
spread
in
a
manner
that
could
only
be
described
as
in
character
and
of
course
dabney
as
the
scientist
responsible
for
the
new
hope
became
known
to
all
peoples
the
experts
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
checked
on
the
publicity
given
to
dabney
strict
advertising
agency
accounting
figured
that
to
date
the
of
dabney
and
his
discovery
were
the
lowest
in
the
history
of
advertising
surveys
disclosed
that
within
three
less
than
of
every
hundred
interviews
questioned
were
completely
ignorant
of
dabney
and
the
prospect
of
travel
to
the
stars
through
his
discovery
more
people
knew
dabney
name
than
knew
the
name
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
was
only
the
beginning
the
leading
show
jumped
eight
points
in
it
actually
reached
rating
when
it
assigned
a
regular
period
to
the
dabney
field
and
its
possibilities
in
human
terms
on
the
sixth
day
after
calculated
indiscretion
the
public
consciousness
was
literally
saturated
with
the
idea
of
transportation
dabney
was
mentioned
in
every
interview
of
every
stuffed
shirt
he
was
referred
to
on
every
comedy
show
three
separate
jokes
had
been
invented
which
were
developed
into
one
thousand
eight
hundred
switcheroos
most
of
them
only
imperceptibly
different
from
the
original
trio
and
even
marilyn
winters
little
aphrodite
herself
was
demanding
a
sequence
in
her
next
television
show
on
the
seventh
day
bill
holden
came
into
the
office
where
cochrane
worked
feverishly
doctor
cochrane
said
holden
a
word
with
you
doctor
asked
cochrane
doctor
repeated
holden
i
just
been
interviewing
my
patient
you
good
my
patient
is
adjusted
cochrane
raised
his
eyebrows
he
famous
said
holden
grimly
he
now
considers
that
everybody
in
the
world
knows
that
he
is
a
great
scientist
he
is
appreciated
he
is
happily
making
plans
to
go
back
to
earth
and
address
a
few
learned
societies
and
let
people
admire
him
he
can
now
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
being
the
man
who
discovered
the
principle
by
which
will
some
day
be
achieved
even
when
the
furor
dies
down
he
will
have
been
a
great
man
and
he
will
stay
a
great
man
in
his
own
estimation
in
short
he
cured
cochrane
grinned
then
i
fired
we
are
said
holden
there
are
professional
ethics
even
among
psychiatrists
jed
i
have
to
admit
that
the
guy
now
has
a
permanent
adjustment
to
reality
he
has
been
recognized
as
a
great
scientist
he
is
no
longer
frustrated
cochrane
leaned
back
in
his
chair
that
may
be
good
medical
ethics
he
observed
but
it
lousy
business
practice
bill
you
say
he
adjusted
to
reality
that
means
that
he
will
now
have
a
socially
acceptable
reaction
to
anything
that
likely
to
happen
to
him
holden
nodded
a
person
does
dabney
the
same
person
he
the
same
fool
but
he
get
along
all
right
a
psychiatrist
ca
change
a
personality
all
he
can
do
is
make
it
adjust
to
the
world
about
so
the
guy
does
have
to
be
tucked
away
in
a
in
that
sense
dabney
is
adjusted
you
played
a
dirty
trick
on
him
said
cochrane
you
stabilized
him
and
that
the
rottenest
trick
anybody
can
play
on
anybody
put
him
into
a
sort
of
moral
it
a
dirty
trick
bill
look
who
talking
said
holden
wearily
i
suppose
the
advertising
business
is
altruistic
and
unmercenary
the
devil
no
said
cochrane
indignantly
we
serve
a
useful
purpose
we
tell
people
that
they
smell
bad
and
so
give
them
an
alibi
for
the
unpopularity
their
stupidity
has
produced
but
then
we
tell
them
to
use
breath
sweetener
or
whosit
deodorant
they
immediately
become
the
life
of
every
party
they
attend
it
a
lie
of
course
but
it
a
dynamic
lie
it
gives
the
frustrated
individual
something
to
do
it
sells
him
hope
and
therefore
activity
and
inactivity
is
a
sort
of
death
holden
looked
at
cochrane
with
a
dreary
disinterest
you
adjusted
jed
but
do
you
really
believe
that
stuff
cochrane
grinned
again
only
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
it
about
true
but
it
does
have
that
much
truth
in
it
nobody
ever
gets
anything
done
while
they
merely
make
socially
acceptable
responses
to
the
things
that
happen
to
them
take
dabney
himself
we
got
a
hell
of
a
thing
coming
along
now
just
because
he
would
make
the
socially
acceptable
response
to
having
a
rich
wife
and
no
brains
he
rebelled
so
mankind
will
start
moving
to
the
stars
you
still
believe
it
cochrane
grimaced
yesterday
morning
i
sweated
blood
in
a
out
in
the
crater
beyond
jones
laboratory
he
tried
his
trick
he
had
a
small
mounted
on
the
far
side
of
that
crater
miles
it
was
in
front
of
the
that
established
the
dabney
field
across
the
crater
to
another
plate
near
us
jones
turned
on
the
field
he
ignited
the
rocket
by
remote
control
i
was
watching
with
a
telescope
i
gave
him
the
word
to
fire
how
long
do
you
think
it
took
that
rocket
to
cross
the
crater
in
that
field
that
works
like
a
pipe
it
smashed
into
the
plate
at
the
lab
holden
shook
his
head
it
took
slightly
said
cochrane
slightly
under
of
a
second
holden
blinked
cochrane
said
a
has
an
acceleration
of
about
six
hundred
feet
per
second
level
flight
no
gravity
component
mass
acceleration
only
it
should
have
taken
a
hundred
seconds
plus
to
cross
that
crater
over
twenty
miles
it
should
have
stayed
on
course
it
did
stay
on
course
inside
the
field
it
did
take
under
of
a
second
the
gadget
works
holden
drew
a
deep
breath
so
now
you
need
more
money
and
you
want
me
not
to
discharge
my
patient
as
cured
not
a
bit
of
it
snapped
cochrane
i
do
want
him
as
a
patient
only
willing
to
accept
him
as
a
customer
but
if
he
wants
fame
sell
it
to
him
not
as
something
to
lean
his
fragile
psyche
on
but
something
to
wallow
in
do
you
think
he
could
ever
get
too
famous
for
his
own
satisfaction
of
course
not
said
holden
he
the
same
fool
then
we
in
business
cochrane
told
him
not
that
i
could
peddle
my
fish
elsewhere
i
going
to
but
i
give
him
preference
i
want
him
out
at
the
tests
this
afternoon
they
be
public
this
afternoon
asked
holden
a
lunar
day
is
two
a
lunar
night
is
equally
cochrane
said
impatiently
i
got
out
of
bed
four
hours
ago
to
me
that
morning
i
eat
lunch
in
an
hour
that
noon
say
three
hours
from
now
whatever
it
is
lunar
time
holden
glanced
at
his
watch
and
made
computations
he
said
that
be
two
hundred
and
three
if
you
curious
but
what
a
shoo
said
cochrane
i
send
babs
to
find
you
and
load
you
on
the
jeep
you
see
then
now
i
busy
holden
shrugged
and
went
away
and
cochrane
stared
at
his
own
watch
since
a
lunar
day
and
night
together
fill
earth
days
of
time
a
strictly
lunar
day
contains
nearly
three
hundred
forty
to
call
of
that
period
an
hour
would
be
an
affectation
to
call
each
earth
hours
a
day
would
have
been
absurd
so
the
actual
period
of
the
moon
rotation
was
divided
into
familiar
and
a
in
the
hotel
lobby
in
lunar
city
notified
those
interested
that
will
be
from
to
there
would
be
another
sunday
some
time
during
the
lunar
afternoon
cochrane
debated
momentarily
whether
this
information
could
be
used
in
the
publicity
campaign
of
spaceways
inc
strictly
speaking
there
was
some
slight
obligation
to
throw
extra
fame
dabney
way
regardless
because
the
corporation
had
been
formed
as
a
device
any
other
features
such
as
changing
the
history
of
the
human
race
were
technically
incidental
but
cochrane
put
his
watch
away
to
talk
about
horology
on
the
moon
would
add
to
dabney
stature
as
a
phoney
scientist
it
did
matter
he
went
back
to
the
business
at
hand
some
two
years
before
there
had
been
a
fake
corporation
organized
strictly
for
the
benefit
of
its
promoters
it
had
built
a
ostensibly
for
the
establishment
of
a
colony
on
mars
the
ship
had
managed
to
stagger
up
to
luna
but
no
farther
its
promoters
had
sold
stock
on
the
promise
that
a
ship
that
could
barely
reach
luna
could
take
off
from
that
small
globe
with
six
times
as
much
fuel
as
it
could
lift
off
of
earth
which
was
true
investors
put
in
their
money
on
that
verifiable
fact
but
the
truth
happened
to
be
of
course
that
it
would
still
take
an
impossible
amount
of
fuel
to
accelerate
the
ship
so
heavily
loaded
to
a
speed
where
it
would
reach
mars
in
one
human
lifetime
taking
off
from
luna
would
solve
only
the
problem
of
gravity
it
would
do
a
thing
about
inertia
so
the
ship
never
rose
from
its
landing
near
lunar
city
the
corporation
that
had
built
it
went
profitably
bankrupt
cochrane
had
been
working
feverishly
to
find
out
who
owned
that
ship
now
just
before
the
he
mentioned
he
found
that
the
ship
belonged
to
the
hotel
who
had
bought
it
in
hope
of
renting
it
sooner
or
later
for
television
in
case
anybody
was
crazy
enough
to
make
a
television
on
the
moon
he
was
now
discouraged
cochrane
chartered
it
putting
up
a
bond
to
return
it
undamaged
if
the
ship
was
lost
the
would
get
back
his
investment
about
a
week
pay
so
cochrane
had
a
practically
in
his
pocket
when
the
public
demonstration
of
the
dabney
field
came
off
at
the
site
of
the
demonstration
was
the
shadowed
part
of
the
floor
of
a
crater
twenty
miles
across
with
walls
some
ten
thousand
jagged
feet
high
the
sunshine
made
the
plain
beyond
the
shadow
into
a
sea
of
blinding
brightness
the
sunlit
parts
of
the
crater
walls
were
no
less
terribly
glaring
but
above
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
the
stars
began
infinitely
small
and
with
innumerable
degrees
of
brightness
the
earth
hung
in
like
a
swollen
green
apple
monstrous
in
size
and
the
figures
which
moved
about
the
scene
of
the
test
could
be
seen
only
faintly
by
reflected
light
from
the
lava
plain
because
one
eyes
had
to
be
adjusted
to
the
on
the
plain
and
mountains
there
were
not
many
persons
present
three
jeeps
waited
in
the
out
of
the
burning
sunshine
there
were
no
more
than
a
dozen
individuals
to
watch
and
to
perform
the
test
of
the
dabney
field
cochrane
had
scrupulously
edited
all
of
the
experiment
to
give
dabney
the
credit
he
had
paid
for
there
were
present
then
the
party
from
earth
cochrane
and
babs
and
holden
with
the
two
tame
scientists
and
bell
the
writer
and
the
only
two
reporters
on
the
moon
only
news
syndicates
could
stand
the
of
a
field
man
in
lunar
city
and
then
there
were
jones
and
dabney
and
two
other
figures
apparently
brought
by
dabney
there
was
of
course
no
sound
at
all
on
the
moon
itself
there
was
no
air
to
carry
it
but
from
each
plastic
helmet
a
antenna
projected
straight
upward
and
the
microwaves
of
made
a
jumble
of
slightly
metallic
sounds
in
the
headphones
of
each
suit
as
soon
as
cochrane
got
out
of
the
jeep
and
was
recognized
dabney
said
agitatedly
cochrane
cochrane
i
have
to
discuss
something
with
you
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
will
you
come
into
the
laboratory
cochrane
helped
babs
to
the
ground
and
made
his
way
to
the
airlock
in
the
against
the
cliff
he
went
in
with
two
other
figures
who
detached
themselves
from
the
rest
to
follow
him
once
inside
the
odorous
cramped
laboratory
dabney
opened
his
and
began
to
speak
before
cochrane
was
ready
to
hear
him
his
companion
beamed
and
therefore
cochrane
dabney
was
saying
agitatedly
i
insist
that
measures
be
taken
to
protect
my
scientific
reputation
if
this
test
should
fail
it
will
militate
against
the
acceptance
of
my
discovery
i
warn
you
and
i
have
my
friend
simms
here
as
witness
that
i
will
not
be
responsible
for
the
operation
of
apparatus
made
by
a
subordinate
who
does
not
fully
comprehend
the
theory
of
my
discovery
i
will
not
be
involved
cochrane
nodded
dabney
of
course
did
understand
the
theory
of
the
field
he
bought
to
but
there
was
no
point
in
bringing
that
up
johnny
simms
beamed
at
both
of
them
he
was
the
swimmer
babs
had
pointed
out
in
the
his
face
was
completely
unlined
and
placid
like
the
face
of
a
college
undergraduate
he
had
never
worried
about
anything
he
never
had
a
care
in
the
world
he
merely
listened
with
placid
interest
i
take
it
said
cochrane
that
you
do
mind
the
test
being
made
so
long
as
you
do
have
to
accept
responsibility
for
its
failure
and
so
long
as
you
get
the
credit
for
its
success
if
it
works
that
right
is
it
if
it
fails
i
am
not
responsible
insisted
dabney
stridently
if
it
succeeds
it
will
be
because
of
my
discovery
cochrane
sighed
a
little
this
was
a
shabby
business
but
dabney
would
have
convinced
himself
by
now
that
he
was
the
genius
he
wanted
people
to
believe
him
before
the
test
said
cochrane
gently
you
make
a
speech
it
will
be
recorded
you
disclaim
the
crass
and
vulgar
mechanical
details
and
emphasize
that
you
are
like
einstein
dealing
in
theoretic
physics
only
that
you
are
naturally
interested
in
attempts
to
use
your
discovery
but
your
presence
is
a
sign
of
your
interest
but
not
your
responsibility
i
shall
have
to
think
it
over
began
dabney
nervously
you
can
say
promised
cochrane
that
if
it
does
not
work
you
will
check
over
what
jones
did
and
tell
him
why
said
dabney
hesitantly
i
could
do
that
but
i
must
think
it
over
first
you
will
have
to
delay
if
i
were
you
said
cochrane
confidentially
i
would
plan
a
speech
to
that
effect
because
the
test
is
coming
off
in
five
minutes
he
closed
his
as
dabney
began
to
protest
he
went
into
the
lock
he
knew
better
than
to
hold
anything
up
while
waiting
for
a
neurotic
to
make
a
decision
dabney
had
all
he
wanted
now
from
this
moment
on
he
would
be
frantic
for
fear
of
losing
it
but
there
could
be
no
argument
outside
the
laboratory
in
the
airlessness
anything
anybody
said
by
could
be
heard
by
everybody
when
dabney
and
simms
followed
out
of
the
lock
cochrane
was
helping
jones
set
up
the
device
that
had
been
prepared
for
this
test
it
was
really
two
devices
one
was
a
very
flat
cone
much
like
a
and
hardly
larger
with
a
sort
of
of
coils
and
batteries
attached
the
other
was
a
rocket
designed
to
make
a
streak
of
red
flame
in
emptiness
nobody
had
yet
figured
out
what
good
a
distress
signal
would
do
between
earth
and
moon
but
the
idea
was
soothing
the
rocket
was
four
feet
long
and
six
inches
in
diameter
at
its
nose
there
was
a
second
cone
with
other
coils
and
batteries
jones
set
the
separate
cone
on
the
ground
and
packed
stones
around
and
under
it
to
brace
it
his
movements
were
almost
ridiculously
deliberate
bending
over
he
bent
slowly
or
the
motion
would
lift
his
feet
off
the
ground
straightening
up
he
straightened
slowly
or
the
upward
impetus
of
his
trunk
would
again
lift
him
beyond
contact
with
solidity
but
he
braced
the
flat
cone
carefully
he
set
the
over
that
cone
the
entire
was
under
six
feet
tall
and
the
cones
were
no
more
than
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
he
said
flatly
i
all
ready
the
hand
and
arm
of
a
figure
lifted
for
attention
dabney
voice
came
worriedly
from
the
headphones
of
every
suit
i
wish
it
understood
he
said
in
some
agitation
that
this
first
attempted
application
of
my
discovery
is
made
with
my
consent
but
that
i
am
not
aware
of
the
mechanical
details
as
a
scientist
my
work
has
been
in
pure
science
i
have
worked
for
the
advancement
of
human
knowledge
but
the
technological
applications
of
my
discovery
are
not
mine
still
if
this
device
does
not
work
i
will
take
time
from
my
more
important
researches
to
inquire
into
what
part
of
my
discovery
has
been
inadequately
understood
and
applied
it
may
be
that
present
technology
is
not
qualified
to
apply
my
discovery
jones
said
without
emotion
but
cochrane
could
imagine
his
expression
inside
his
helmet
that
right
i
consulted
dabney
about
the
principles
but
the
apparatus
is
my
doing
i
take
the
responsibility
for
that
then
cochrane
added
with
pleasant
irony
since
all
this
is
recorded
dabney
can
enlarge
upon
his
disinterest
later
right
now
we
can
go
ahead
dabney
disavows
us
unless
we
are
successful
let
us
let
it
go
at
that
then
he
said
the
set
to
track
a
muffled
voice
said
boredly
by
from
the
observatory
up
on
the
crater
rim
ready
visual
and
records
and
we
got
the
timers
set
to
clock
the
signals
as
they
come
the
voice
was
not
enthusiastic
cochrane
had
had
to
put
up
his
own
money
to
have
the
nearside
lunar
observatory
put
a
telescope
to
watch
the
rocket
flight
in
theory
this
should
make
a
streak
of
relatively
red
sparks
a
tiny
in
its
nose
was
set
to
send
microwave
signals
at
intervals
on
the
face
of
it
it
had
looked
like
a
rather
futile
performance
let
go
said
cochrane
he
noted
with
surprise
that
his
mouth
was
suddenly
dry
this
affair
was
out
of
all
reason
a
producer
of
television
shows
should
not
be
the
person
to
discover
in
an
abstruse
scientific
development
the
way
to
reach
the
stars
a
neurotic
of
an
advertising
tycoon
should
not
be
the
instrument
by
which
the
discovery
should
come
about
a
psychiatrist
should
not
be
the
means
of
associating
jones
a
very
junior
physicist
with
no
money
and
cochrane
and
the
things
cochrane
was
prepared
to
bring
about
if
only
this
gadget
worked
jones
said
cochrane
with
a
little
difficulty
let
follow
an
ancient
tradition
let
babs
christen
the
enterprise
by
throwing
the
switch
jones
pointed
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
and
babs
moved
to
the
switch
he
indicated
she
said
absorbedly
five
four
three
two
one
she
threw
the
switch
there
was
a
spout
of
lurid
red
flame
the
rocket
vanished
it
vanished
it
did
not
rise
visibly
it
simply
went
away
from
where
it
was
with
all
the
abruptness
of
a
light
going
out
there
was
a
flurry
of
the
most
brilliant
imaginable
carmine
flame
that
light
remained
but
the
rocket
did
not
so
much
rise
as
disappear
cochrane
jerked
his
head
up
he
was
close
to
the
line
of
the
ascent
he
could
see
a
trail
of
red
sparks
which
stretched
to
invisibility
it
was
an
extraordinarily
thin
line
the
separate
flecks
of
crimson
light
which
comprised
it
were
distant
in
space
they
were
so
far
from
each
other
that
the
was
a
complete
failure
as
a
device
making
a
streak
of
light
that
should
be
visible
the
muffled
voice
in
the
said
blankly
what
you
do
to
that
rocket
the
others
did
not
move
they
seemed
stunned
the
vanishing
of
the
rocket
was
no
way
for
a
rocket
to
act
in
all
expectation
it
should
have
soared
skyward
with
a
reasonable
velocity
and
should
have
accelerated
rather
more
swiftly
from
the
moon
surface
than
it
would
have
done
from
earth
but
it
should
have
remained
visible
during
all
its
flight
its
trail
should
have
been
a
thick
red
line
instead
the
red
sparks
were
so
far
separated
the
trail
was
so
attenuated
that
it
was
visible
only
from
a
spot
near
its
base
the
observatory
voice
said
more
blankly
still
i
picked
up
the
trail
i
ca
see
it
nearby
but
it
seems
to
start
thin
about
fifty
miles
up
and
go
on
away
from
there
that
rocket
should
ha
gone
more
than
twenty
miles
what
happened
for
the
microwave
said
jones
voice
in
headphones
the
voice
from
the
observatory
squeaked
suddenly
this
was
not
one
of
the
astronomers
but
part
of
the
mechanical
staff
been
willing
to
do
an
unreasonable
chore
for
pay
the
blip
it
crazy
nothing
can
go
that
fast
and
then
in
the
phones
there
came
the
relayed
signal
of
the
in
the
vanished
rocket
the
was
that
of
a
radar
pulse
beginning
at
low
pitch
and
rising
three
octaves
in
the
tenth
of
a
second
at
middle
c
the
middle
of
the
range
of
a
piano
there
was
a
momentary
spurt
of
extra
volume
but
in
the
relayed
signal
that
louder
instant
had
dropped
four
tones
cochrane
said
crisply
jones
what
speed
would
that
be
take
a
to
figure
said
jones
voice
very
calmly
it
faster
than
anything
ever
went
cochrane
waited
for
the
next
beep
it
did
not
come
in
ten
seconds
it
was
easily
fifteen
even
he
could
figure
out
what
that
meant
a
that
stretched
ten
seconds
of
interval
at
source
to
fifteen
at
reception
the
voice
from
the
observatory
wailed
crazy
it
ca
be
going
like
that
they
waited
fifteen
seconds
more
sixteen
eighteen
twenty
the
beep
sounded
the
spurt
of
sound
had
dropped
a
full
octave
the
traveling
normally
might
have
attained
a
maximum
velocity
of
some
two
thousand
feet
per
second
it
was
now
moving
at
a
speed
which
was
an
appreciably
large
fraction
of
the
speed
of
light
which
was
starkly
impossible
it
simply
happened
to
be
true
they
heard
the
signal
once
more
the
observatory
receiver
had
been
stepped
up
to
maximum
amplification
the
signal
was
distinct
but
very
faint
indeed
and
the
rocket
was
then
traveling
so
it
was
later
computed
at
of
the
speed
of
light
between
the
flat
cone
on
the
front
of
the
and
the
flat
cone
on
the
ground
a
field
of
force
existed
the
field
was
not
on
the
back
surface
of
the
torpedo
cone
but
before
the
front
surface
it
went
back
to
the
moon
from
there
so
all
the
torpedo
and
its
batteries
were
in
the
columnar
stressed
space
and
an
amount
of
that
should
have
sent
the
torpedo
maybe
twenty
miles
during
its
period
of
burning
had
actually
extended
its
flight
to
more
than
hundred
miles
before
the
red
sparks
were
too
far
separated
to
be
traced
any
farther
and
by
then
had
kicked
the
torpedo
up
impossibly
close
to
in
a
sense
the
dabney
field
had
an
effect
similar
to
the
invention
of
railways
the
same
horsepower
moved
vastly
more
weight
faster
over
steel
rails
than
it
could
haul
over
a
rutted
dirt
road
the
same
moved
more
weight
faster
in
the
dabney
field
than
in
normal
space
there
would
be
a
practical
limit
to
the
speed
at
which
a
wagon
could
be
drawn
over
a
rough
road
the
speed
of
light
was
a
limit
to
the
speed
of
matter
in
normal
space
but
on
a
railway
the
practical
speed
at
which
a
vehicle
could
travel
went
up
from
three
miles
an
hour
to
a
hundred
and
twenty
in
the
dabney
field
it
was
yet
to
be
discovered
what
the
limiting
velocity
might
be
but
old
formulas
for
acceleration
and
simply
did
not
apply
in
a
dabney
field
jones
rode
back
to
lunar
city
with
cochrane
and
holden
and
babs
his
face
was
babs
tried
to
recover
the
mien
and
manner
of
the
perfect
secretary
cochrane
she
said
professionally
will
you
want
to
read
the
publicity
releases
bell
turns
out
from
what
west
and
jamison
tell
him
i
do
think
it
matters
said
cochrane
the
newsmen
will
pump
west
and
jamison
empty
anyhow
it
all
right
in
fact
it
better
than
our
own
releases
would
be
they
contradict
each
other
it
sound
more
authentic
that
way
we
building
up
a
for
information
the
small
rolled
and
bumped
gently
down
the
long
improbable
highway
back
to
lunar
city
its
engine
ran
smoothly
as
always
do
it
ran
on
seventy
per
cent
hydrogen
peroxide
first
developed
as
a
fuel
back
in
the
for
the
pumps
of
the
rockets
that
tried
to
win
the
second
world
war
for
germany
when
hydrogen
peroxide
comes
in
contact
with
a
catalyst
such
as
permanganate
of
potash
it
breaks
down
into
oxygen
and
water
but
the
water
is
in
the
form
of
steam
which
is
used
in
engines
the
jeep
fuel
supplied
steam
for
power
and
its
ashes
were
water
to
drink
and
oxygen
to
breathe
steam
ran
all
motorized
vehicles
on
luna
what
are
you
thinking
about
jones
asked
cochrane
suddenly
jones
said
meditatively
i
wondering
what
sort
of
a
system
would
give
me
i
boosted
the
field
intensity
this
time
the
results
were
pretty
good
i
thinking
suppose
i
made
the
field
with
a
or
maybe
a
unit
even
a
portable
gives
a
couple
of
million
watts
for
the
of
a
second
suppose
i
fixed
up
a
to
give
me
a
field
with
a
few
billion
watts
in
it
it
might
be
practically
like
though
it
would
really
be
only
travel
i
think
i
got
to
work
on
that
idea
a
little
cochrane
digested
the
information
in
silence
far
be
it
from
me
he
said
presently
to
discourage
such
contemplation
bill
what
on
your
mind
holden
said
moodily
i
convinced
that
the
thing
works
but
jed
you
talk
as
if
you
any
more
worries
yet
even
if
you
and
jones
do
have
a
way
to
make
a
ship
travel
faster
than
light
you
have
got
a
ship
or
the
capital
you
need
i
got
scenery
that
looks
like
a
ship
said
cochrane
mildly
consider
that
part
settled
but
there
are
supplies
air
water
food
a
crew
we
ca
pay
for
such
things
here
on
the
moon
the
cost
of
everything
is
preposterous
how
can
you
try
out
this
idea
without
more
capital
than
you
can
possibly
raise
i
going
to
imitate
my
old
friend
christopher
columbus
said
cochrane
i
going
to
give
the
customers
what
they
want
columbus
did
try
to
sell
anybody
shares
in
new
continents
who
wanted
new
continents
who
wanted
to
move
to
a
new
world
who
wants
new
planets
now
everybody
would
like
to
see
their
neighbors
move
away
and
leave
more
room
but
nobody
wants
to
move
himself
columbus
sold
a
promise
of
something
that
had
an
value
that
could
be
sold
in
every
town
and
village
that
had
a
merchandising
system
already
set
up
i
going
to
offer
just
such
a
marketable
commodity
i
have
on
the
way
up
here
within
hours
and
the
freight
and
their
contents
will
all
be
paid
for
he
turned
to
babs
he
looked
more
sardonic
and
cynical
than
ever
before
babs
you
just
witnessed
one
of
the
moments
that
ought
to
be
illustrated
in
all
the
along
with
ben
franklin
flying
a
kite
what
topmost
in
your
mind
she
hesitated
and
then
flushed
the
crunched
and
clanked
loudly
over
the
trail
that
led
downhill
there
was
no
sound
outside
of
course
there
was
no
air
but
the
noise
inside
the
was
notable
the
in
particular
made
a
highly
individual
racket
i
rather
not
say
said
babs
awkwardly
what
your
own
main
feeling
mr
cochrane
mine
cochrane
grinned
i
thinking
what
a
hell
of
a
funny
world
this
is
when
people
like
dabney
and
bill
and
jones
and
i
are
the
ones
who
have
to
begin
operation
outer
space
chapter
four
cochrane
said
kindly
into
the
microphone
to
earth
cancel
section
c
paragraph
nine
then
section
b
from
paragraph
eleven
then
after
you
canceled
the
entire
last
section
fourteen
we
can
sign
up
the
deal
there
was
a
pause
about
two
seconds
for
his
voice
to
reach
earth
about
two
seconds
for
the
beginning
of
the
reply
to
reach
him
the
man
at
the
other
end
protested
wildly
we
a
long
way
apart
said
cochrane
blandly
and
our
talk
only
travels
at
the
speed
of
light
you
not
talking
from
one
continent
to
another
save
tolls
yes
or
no
another
pause
the
man
on
earth
profanely
agreed
cochrane
signed
the
contract
before
him
the
other
man
signed
not
only
the
documents
but
all
conversation
was
recorded
there
were
witnesses
the
contract
was
binding
cochrane
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
blinked
wearily
he
spent
hours
going
over
the
contract
with
joint
networks
and
had
weeded
out
a
total
of
six
he
was
very
tired
he
yawned
you
can
tell
jones
babs
he
said
that
all
the
high
done
he
can
spend
money
and
you
can
transmit
my
resignation
to
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
and
since
this
is
a
pretty
risky
operation
you
better
send
a
service
message
asking
what
you
to
do
with
yourself
they
probably
tell
you
to
take
the
next
rocket
back
and
report
to
the
secretarial
pool
i
afraid
the
same
fate
probably
awaits
west
and
jamison
and
bell
babs
said
guiltily
cochrane
you
been
so
busy
i
had
to
use
my
own
judgment
i
did
want
to
interrupt
you
what
now
demanded
cochrane
the
publicity
on
the
said
babs
guiltily
was
so
good
that
the
firm
was
worried
for
fear
we
seem
to
be
doing
it
for
a
client
of
the
firm
which
we
are
so
we
all
been
put
on
a
status
officially
we
all
sick
and
the
firm
is
paying
our
expenses
until
we
regain
our
health
kind
of
them
said
cochrane
what
the
bite
they
sending
up
talent
contracts
for
us
to
sign
admitted
babs
when
we
go
back
we
would
command
top
prices
for
interviews
the
firm
of
course
will
want
to
control
that
cochrane
raised
his
eyebrows
i
see
but
you
actually
be
kept
off
the
air
so
dabney
can
be
television
boy
he
go
on
marilyn
winter
show
bet
because
that
has
the
biggest
audience
on
the
planet
he
lecture
little
aphrodite
herself
on
the
constants
of
space
and
she
flutter
her
eyelashes
at
him
and
shove
her
in
his
direction
and
breathe
how
wonderful
it
is
to
be
a
man
of
science
how
you
know
demanded
babs
surprised
cochrane
winced
heaven
help
me
babs
i
did
i
tried
to
guess
at
something
too
impossible
even
for
the
advertising
business
but
i
failed
i
failed
you
and
my
official
gang
then
are
here
with
the
firm
blessing
free
of
all
commands
and
obligations
but
drawing
salary
and
expenses
yes
admitted
babs
and
so
are
you
i
get
off
said
cochrane
firmly
forward
my
resignation
it
a
matter
of
pure
vanity
but
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
do
move
in
a
mysterious
way
to
latch
onto
a
fast
buck
i
going
to
get
some
sleep
is
there
anything
else
you
had
to
use
your
judgment
on
the
contracts
for
of
the
the
original
broadcast
had
an
of
such
said
cochrane
are
the
uses
of
fame
our
cash
she
showed
him
a
neatly
typed
statement
for
the
original
run
of
the
so
much
it
was
to
be
with
a
popularization
of
the
technical
details
by
west
and
a
lurid
extrapolation
of
things
to
come
by
jamison
the
sponsors
who
got
hold
of
commercial
time
with
that
expanded
and
version
would
expect
and
get
an
unparalleled
in
history
dabney
was
to
take
a
bow
on
the
rebroadcast
too
very
much
the
dignified
and
aloof
scientist
there
were
other
interviews
dabney
again
from
a
script
written
by
bell
and
jones
jones
hated
the
idea
of
being
interviewed
but
he
had
faced
a
and
answered
idiotic
questions
and
gone
angrily
back
to
his
work
spaceways
had
a
already
amounting
to
more
than
twenty
years
of
cochrane
best
he
was
selling
publicity
for
sponsors
to
hang
their
commercials
on
in
a
strict
parallel
to
christopher
columbus
selling
of
spices
to
come
but
cochrane
was
delivering
for
cash
were
on
the
way
moonward
now
whose
cargoes
of
supplies
for
a
cochrane
was
accepting
only
when
a
bonus
in
money
was
paid
for
the
right
to
brag
about
it
oxygen
paid
for
the
privilege
of
supplying
dehydrated
vegetables
were
accepted
on
similar
terms
with
whoosit
instant
coffee
and
somebody
else
noodle
soup
in
bags
if
said
cochrane
tiredly
looking
up
from
the
statement
we
could
only
start
off
in
a
fleet
instead
of
a
single
ship
babs
we
not
only
be
equipped
but
so
rich
before
we
started
that
we
want
to
stay
home
to
enjoy
it
he
yawned
prodigiously
i
going
to
get
some
sleep
let
me
sleep
too
long
he
went
off
to
his
and
was
out
cold
before
his
head
had
drifted
down
to
its
pillow
but
he
was
not
pleased
with
himself
it
annoyed
him
that
his
revolt
against
being
an
expendable
employee
had
taken
the
form
of
acting
like
one
of
his
former
bosses
in
collecting
ruthlessly
for
the
brains
in
the
case
of
jones
and
the
neurotic
idiosyncrasies
in
the
case
of
dabney
of
other
men
the
gesture
by
which
he
had
become
independent
was
not
quite
the
splendid
scornful
one
he
have
liked
the
fact
that
this
sort
of
gesture
worked
and
nothing
else
would
have
did
not
make
him
feel
better
but
he
slept
he
dreamed
that
he
was
back
at
his
normal
business
of
producing
a
television
show
nobody
but
himself
cared
whether
the
show
went
on
or
not
the
actual
purpose
of
all
his
subordinates
seemed
to
be
to
cut
as
many
throats
among
their
as
possible
in
a
business
way
of
course
so
that
by
their
own
survival
they
might
succeed
to
a
better
job
and
higher
pay
this
is
what
is
called
the
fine
spirit
of
teamwork
by
which
things
get
done
both
in
private
and
public
enterprise
it
was
a
very
realistic
dream
but
it
was
not
restful
while
he
slept
the
world
wagged
on
and
the
cosmos
continued
on
its
normal
course
the
two
moons
of
earth
one
natural
and
one
artificial
swung
in
splendid
circles
about
a
psychiatrist
should
not
be
the
means
of
missing
text
that
planet
divided
rings
the
red
spot
of
jupiter
and
the
bands
on
that
world
moved
in
orderly
fashion
about
its
circumference
away
giant
cepheid
suns
expanded
monstrously
and
contracted
again
rather
more
rapidly
than
their
gravitational
fields
could
account
for
double
stars
sedately
swung
about
each
other
comets
reached
their
farthest
points
and
mere
aggregations
of
frigid
jagged
stones
and
metal
prepared
for
another
plunge
back
into
light
and
heat
and
warmth
and
various
prosaic
actions
took
place
on
luna
when
cochrane
waked
and
went
back
to
the
in
use
as
an
office
he
found
babs
talking
confidentially
to
a
woman
girl
rather
whom
cochrane
vaguely
remembered
then
he
did
a
double
take
he
did
remember
her
three
or
four
years
before
she
been
the
outstanding
television
personality
of
the
year
she
been
pretty
but
not
so
pretty
that
you
did
realize
that
she
was
a
person
she
was
everything
that
marilyn
winters
was
not
and
she
been
number
two
name
in
television
cochrane
said
blankly
are
you
alicia
keith
the
girl
smiled
faintly
she
was
as
pretty
as
she
had
been
she
looked
patient
and
an
expression
of
patience
on
a
woman
face
is
certainly
not
unpleasant
but
it
is
glamorous
either
i
was
she
said
i
married
johnny
simms
cochrane
looked
at
babs
they
live
up
here
explained
babs
i
pointed
him
out
at
the
the
day
we
got
here
wonderful
said
cochrane
how
johnny
said
alicia
has
bought
into
your
spaceways
corporation
he
got
your
man
west
drunk
and
bought
his
shares
of
spaceway
stock
cochrane
sat
down
not
hard
because
it
was
impossible
to
sit
down
hard
on
the
moon
but
he
sat
down
as
hard
as
it
was
possible
to
sit
why
he
do
that
he
found
out
you
had
hold
of
the
old
mars
colony
ship
he
understands
you
going
to
take
a
trip
out
to
the
stars
he
wants
to
go
along
very
much
like
a
little
boy
he
hates
it
here
then
why
live
cochrane
checked
the
question
not
quite
in
time
he
ca
go
back
to
earth
said
alicia
calmly
he
a
psychopathic
personality
he
sane
and
quite
bright
and
rather
dear
in
his
way
but
he
simply
ca
remember
what
is
right
and
wrong
especially
when
he
gets
excited
when
they
fixed
up
lunar
city
as
an
international
colony
by
sheer
oversight
they
forgot
to
arrange
for
extradition
from
it
so
johnny
can
live
here
he
ca
live
anywhere
else
not
for
long
cochrane
said
nothing
he
wants
to
go
with
you
said
alicia
pleasantly
he
thrilled
the
lawyer
his
family
keeps
up
here
to
watch
over
him
is
thrilled
too
he
wants
to
go
back
and
visit
his
family
and
as
a
stockholder
johnny
can
keep
you
from
taking
a
ship
or
any
other
corporate
property
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
but
he
rather
go
with
you
of
course
i
have
to
go
too
it
blackmail
said
cochrane
without
heat
a
pretty
neat
job
of
it
too
babs
you
see
holden
about
this
he
a
psychiatrist
he
turned
to
alicia
why
do
you
want
to
go
i
do
know
whether
it
be
dangerous
or
not
i
married
johnny
said
alicia
her
smile
was
composed
i
thought
it
would
be
wonderful
to
be
able
to
trust
somebody
that
nobody
else
could
trust
after
a
moment
she
added
it
would
be
if
one
could
a
few
moments
later
she
went
away
very
pleasantly
and
very
calmly
her
husband
had
no
sense
of
right
or
wrong
not
in
action
anyhow
she
tried
to
keep
him
from
doing
too
much
damage
by
exercising
the
knowledge
she
had
of
what
was
fair
and
what
was
not
cochrane
grimaced
and
told
babs
to
make
a
note
to
talk
to
holden
but
there
were
other
matters
on
hand
too
there
were
waivers
to
be
signed
by
everybody
who
went
along
off
luna
then
cochrane
said
thoughtfully
alicia
keith
would
be
a
good
name
for
he
plunged
into
the
mess
of
and
haggling
which
somebody
has
to
do
before
any
achievement
of
consequence
can
come
about
pioneer
efforts
in
particular
require
the
same
sort
of
process
as
the
settling
of
a
frontier
farm
instead
of
trees
to
be
chopped
and
dug
up
by
the
roots
there
are
the
gratuitous
obstructionists
who
have
to
be
chopped
off
at
the
ankles
in
a
business
way
and
the
people
who
exercise
infinite
ingenuity
trying
to
get
a
cut
of
something
anything
somebody
else
is
doing
and
of
course
there
are
the
since
spaceways
was
being
financed
on
sales
of
publicity
which
could
be
turned
on
this
product
and
that
cut
into
its
revenue
and
capital
back
on
earth
a
crackpot
inventor
had
a
lawyer
busily
garnering
free
advertisement
by
press
conferences
about
the
injury
done
his
client
by
spaceways
who
had
stolen
his
invention
to
travel
through
space
faster
than
light
somebody
in
the
senate
made
a
speech
accusing
the
spaceway
project
of
being
a
political
move
by
the
party
in
power
for
some
dire
ultimate
purpose
ultimately
the
crackpot
inventor
would
get
on
the
air
and
announce
triumphantly
that
only
part
of
his
invention
had
been
stolen
because
he
been
too
smart
to
write
it
down
or
tell
anybody
and
he
tell
anybody
not
even
a
court
the
full
details
of
his
invention
unless
paid
million
in
cash
down
and
royalties
afterward
the
project
for
a
congressional
investigation
of
spaceways
would
die
in
committee
but
there
were
other
griefs
the
useless
spaceship
hulk
had
to
be
emptied
of
the
stored
in
it
this
was
done
by
men
working
in
occupational
rules
required
them
to
exert
not
more
than
of
the
effort
they
would
have
done
if
working
for
themselves
when
the
ship
was
empty
air
was
released
in
it
and
immediately
froze
to
so
radiant
heaters
had
to
be
installed
and
powered
to
warm
up
the
hull
to
where
an
atmosphere
could
exist
in
it
its
generators
had
to
be
thawed
from
the
stage
of
brittleness
and
warmed
to
where
they
could
be
run
without
breaking
themselves
to
bits
but
there
were
good
breaks
too
presently
a
former
grounded
to
an
administrative
job
on
luna
on
his
own
free
time
checked
over
the
ship
jones
arranged
it
with
of
adamite
the
stuff
discovered
by
pure
accident
in
a
back
on
earth
the
propelling
apparatus
checked
out
the
had
been
taken
over
in
fullness
of
design
from
pumps
on
earth
they
were
all
right
the
apparatus
had
been
developed
from
the
aeriating
in
which
antibiotics
were
grown
on
earth
it
needed
only
reseeding
with
algae
microscopic
plants
which
when
supplied
with
ultraviolet
light
fed
avidly
on
carbon
dioxide
and
yielded
oxygen
the
ship
was
a
rather
involved
combination
of
essentially
simple
devices
it
could
be
put
back
into
such
workability
as
it
had
once
possessed
with
practically
no
trouble
it
was
jones
moved
into
it
with
masses
of
apparatus
from
the
laboratory
in
the
lunar
apennines
he
labored
lovingly
fanatically
like
most
spectacular
discoveries
the
dabney
field
was
basically
simple
it
was
almost
idiotically
uncomplicated
in
theory
it
was
a
condition
of
the
space
just
outside
one
surface
of
a
sheet
of
metal
it
was
like
that
on
the
wires
of
a
when
electricity
is
transmitted
in
the
form
of
alterations
and
travels
on
the
skins
of
many
strands
of
metal
because
current
simply
does
not
flow
inside
of
wires
but
only
on
their
surfaces
the
dabney
field
formed
on
the
surface
or
infinitesimally
beyond
it
of
a
metal
sheet
in
which
were
induced
in
a
varying
fashion
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
so
jones
made
the
exterior
forward
surface
of
the
abandoned
spaceship
into
a
generator
of
the
dabney
field
it
was
not
only
simple
it
was
too
simple
having
made
the
bow
of
the
ship
into
a
dabney
field
plate
he
immediately
arranged
that
he
could
at
will
make
the
rear
of
the
ship
into
another
dabney
field
plate
the
two
plates
turned
on
together
amounted
to
something
that
could
be
contemplated
with
startled
awe
but
jones
planned
to
start
off
at
least
in
a
manner
exactly
like
the
test
the
job
of
wiring
up
for
travel
however
was
not
much
more
difficult
than
wiring
a
bungalow
when
one
knew
how
it
should
be
done
two
came
in
picked
up
by
radar
and
guided
to
landings
by
remote
control
the
lunar
city
beam
receiver
picked
up
music
aimed
up
from
earth
and
duly
relayed
it
to
the
which
were
the
buildings
of
the
city
the
colonists
and
became
familiar
with
new
tunes
dealing
with
prospective
travel
to
the
stars
one
work
of
genius
tied
in
a
drama
titled
of
to
the
lunar
operation
and
charmed
listeners
saw
and
heard
the
latest
youthful
tenor
gently
plead
of
hate
come
to
the
stars
and
the
publicity
department
responsible
for
the
masterpiece
considered
itself
not
far
from
genius
too
there
was
confusion
thrice
and
four
and
five
times
confounded
cochrane
came
in
to
dispute
furiously
with
holden
whether
it
was
better
to
have
a
psychopathic
personality
on
the
or
to
have
a
legal
battle
in
the
courts
cochrane
won
jones
arrived
belligerent
to
do
battle
for
technical
devices
which
would
cost
money
look
said
cochrane
harassedly
i
not
trying
to
boss
you
come
to
me
for
authority
if
you
can
make
that
ship
take
off
i
be
in
it
and
my
neck
will
be
in
as
much
danger
as
yours
you
buy
what
will
keep
my
neck
as
safe
as
possible
along
with
yours
i
busy
raising
money
and
fighting
off
crackpots
and
dodging
lawsuits
and
getting
supplies
i
got
a
job
that
needs
three
men
anyhow
all
i
hoping
is
that
you
get
ready
to
take
off
before
i
start
cutting
out
paperdolls
when
can
we
leave
we
said
jones
suspiciously
you
going
if
you
think
i
stay
behind
and
face
what
happen
if
this
business
flops
cochrane
told
him
you
crazy
there
are
too
many
people
on
earth
already
there
no
room
for
a
man
who
tried
something
big
and
failed
if
this
flops
i
rather
be
a
frozen
corpse
with
a
happy
smile
on
my
face
i
understand
that
in
space
one
freezes
than
somebody
living
on
assisted
survival
status
on
earth
oh
said
jones
mollified
how
many
people
are
to
go
ask
bill
holden
cochrane
told
him
remember
if
you
need
something
get
it
i
try
to
pay
for
it
if
we
come
back
with
of
outer
space
even
if
we
only
circumnavigate
mars
we
have
money
enough
to
pay
for
anything
jones
regarded
cochrane
with
something
almost
like
warmth
i
like
this
way
of
doing
business
he
said
it
not
business
protested
cochrane
this
is
getting
something
done
by
the
way
have
you
picked
out
a
destination
for
us
to
aim
at
when
jones
shook
his
head
cochrane
said
harassedly
better
get
one
picked
out
but
when
we
make
out
our
papers
for
destination
we
say
the
stars
a
nice
line
for
the
news
broadcasts
oh
yes
tell
bill
holden
to
try
to
find
us
a
skipper
an
astrogator
somebody
who
can
tell
us
how
to
get
back
if
we
get
anywhere
we
need
to
get
back
from
is
there
such
a
person
i
got
him
said
jones
he
checked
the
ship
for
me
former
pilot
he
here
in
lunar
city
thanks
he
shook
hands
with
cochrane
before
he
left
which
for
jones
was
an
expression
of
overwhelming
emotion
cochrane
turned
back
to
his
desk
let
see
that
arrangement
for
cachets
on
stamps
and
covers
to
be
taken
along
and
postmarked
outer
space
put
in
a
stipulation
for
extra
payment
in
case
we
touch
on
planets
and
invent
postmarks
for
them
he
worked
on
while
babs
took
notes
presently
he
was
dictating
and
as
he
talked
frowning
he
took
a
from
his
pocket
and
absently
worked
the
it
made
ink
exude
from
the
on
the
moon
the
surface
tension
of
the
ink
was
exactly
the
same
as
on
earth
but
the
gravity
was
less
so
a
drop
of
ink
of
really
impressive
size
could
be
formed
before
the
moon
weak
gravity
made
it
fall
dictating
as
he
worked
the
pen
cochrane
achieved
a
mass
of
ink
which
was
quite
the
size
of
a
large
grape
before
it
fell
into
his
it
was
the
largest
he
made
to
date
it
fell
and
splashed
violently
as
he
regarded
it
with
harried
satisfaction
more
time
passed
a
arrived
from
earth
there
were
new
tourists
under
the
plastic
dome
out
by
the
former
jones
made
experiments
with
small
plastic
balloons
coated
with
a
conducting
varnish
in
a
vacuum
a
cubic
inch
of
air
at
will
expand
to
make
many
cubic
feet
of
if
a
balloon
can
sustain
an
internal
pressure
of
one
ounce
to
the
square
foot
a
thimbleful
of
air
will
inflate
a
sizeable
globe
to
that
pressure
jones
was
arranging
tiny
dabney
field
with
tiny
atomic
batteries
to
power
them
each
such
balloon
would
be
a
dabney
field
plate
when
cast
adrift
in
emptiness
and
its
little
battery
would
keep
it
in
operation
for
twenty
years
or
more
baggage
came
up
from
earth
for
johnny
simms
it
was
mostly
and
ammunition
for
them
johnny
as
the
heir
to
innumerable
millions
back
on
earth
had
had
a
happy
life
but
hardly
one
to
give
him
a
practical
view
of
things
to
him
meant
landing
on
such
exotic
planets
as
the
fictioneers
had
been
writing
about
for
a
hundred
years
or
so
he
really
looked
upon
the
venture
into
space
as
a
combined
expedition
and
escape
from
lunar
city
and
he
did
look
forward
too
to
freedom
from
his
family
legal
representative
and
the
constant
reminder
of
ethical
and
moral
values
which
johnny
preferred
happily
to
ignore
came
up
and
cameras
to
use
it
in
every
imaginable
item
an
expedition
to
space
could
use
or
even
might
use
was
thrust
upon
spaceways
manufacturers
yearned
to
have
their
products
used
in
connection
with
the
hottest
news
story
in
decades
there
was
a
steady
trailing
of
from
the
airlocks
of
lunar
city
to
the
ship
the
time
of
lunar
sunset
arrived
five
hundred
and
three
hours
time
was
measured
from
midnight
to
midnight
astronomical
fashion
the
great
blazing
sun
whose
streamer
prominences
even
were
too
bright
to
be
looked
at
with
the
naked
eye
the
sun
neared
and
reached
the
horizon
there
was
no
change
in
the
sky
there
were
no
sunset
colorings
the
incandescent
brightness
on
the
mountains
was
not
lessened
in
the
least
only
the
direction
of
the
stark
black
shadows
shifted
the
glaring
sun
descended
its
motion
was
almost
infinitely
slow
its
disk
was
of
the
order
of
half
a
degree
of
arc
and
it
took
a
full
hour
to
be
fully
obscured
and
then
there
was
at
first
no
difference
in
the
look
of
things
save
that
the
the
solidified
arid
sea
of
showers
was
as
dark
as
the
shadows
in
the
mountains
they
still
gleamed
brightly
for
a
very
long
time
the
sunshine
glowed
on
their
flanks
the
brightness
rose
and
rose
and
blackness
followed
it
at
long
last
only
the
topmost
peaks
of
the
apennines
blazed
luridly
against
a
background
of
stars
whose
light
seemed
feeble
by
comparison
then
it
was
night
indeed
but
the
earth
shone
forth
a
of
seas
and
clouds
and
continents
vast
and
nostalgic
in
the
sky
and
now
earthshine
fell
upon
the
moon
it
was
many
times
brighter
than
moonlight
ever
was
upon
the
earth
even
at
lunar
sunset
the
earthlight
was
sixteen
times
brighter
at
midnight
when
the
earth
was
full
it
would
be
bright
enough
for
any
activity
actually
the
human
beings
on
luna
were
nearly
nocturnal
in
their
habits
because
it
was
easier
to
run
in
frigidity
and
keep
men
and
machines
warm
enough
for
functioning
than
it
was
to
protect
them
against
the
heat
of
midday
on
the
moon
so
the
activity
about
the
salvaged
increased
there
were
electric
lights
blazing
in
the
to
guide
freight
vehicles
with
their
loads
the
went
and
returned
and
went
and
returned
the
last
shipload
of
travelers
from
earth
wanted
to
see
the
about
which
all
the
world
was
talking
even
cochrane
presently
became
curious
there
came
a
time
when
all
the
connected
with
what
had
happened
was
done
with
and
conditional
contracts
drawn
up
on
everything
that
could
be
foreseen
it
was
time
for
something
new
to
happen
cochrane
said
dubiously
babs
have
you
seen
the
ship
she
shook
her
head
i
think
we
better
go
take
a
look
at
it
said
cochrane
do
you
know
i
been
acting
like
a
damned
business
man
i
only
been
out
of
lunar
city
three
times
once
to
the
laboratory
to
talk
once
to
test
a
across
the
crater
and
once
when
the
went
off
i
have
even
seen
the
nightclub
here
in
the
city
you
should
said
babs
i
went
once
with
doctor
holden
the
dancing
was
marvelous
bill
holden
eh
said
cochrane
he
found
himself
annoyed
took
you
to
the
nightclub
but
not
to
see
the
ship
the
ship
farther
explained
babs
i
could
always
be
found
at
the
nightclub
if
you
needed
me
i
went
when
you
were
asleep
damn
said
cochrane
hm
you
ought
to
get
a
bonus
what
would
you
rather
have
babs
a
bonus
in
cash
or
spaceways
stock
i
got
some
stock
said
babs
bell
the
writer
you
know
got
in
a
poker
game
he
was
cleaned
out
so
i
gave
him
all
the
money
i
had
i
told
you
i
cleared
out
my
before
we
came
up
i
think
for
half
his
shares
either
you
got
very
badly
stuck
cochrane
told
her
cynically
or
else
you
be
so
rich
you
wo
speak
to
me
oh
no
said
babs
warmly
never
cochrane
yawned
let
get
out
and
take
a
look
at
the
ship
maybe
i
can
stow
cargo
or
something
now
there
no
more
babs
said
with
an
odd
calm
jones
wanted
you
out
there
today
in
an
hour
he
said
i
promised
you
go
i
meant
to
mention
it
in
time
cochrane
did
not
notice
her
tone
he
was
as
only
a
man
can
be
who
has
driven
himself
at
top
speed
for
days
on
end
over
a
business
deal
business
deals
are
stimulating
only
in
their
major
aspects
most
of
the
details
are
niggling
tedious
routine
and
boring
and
very
often
cochrane
had
done
with
only
babs
help
an
amount
of
mental
labor
that
in
the
offices
of
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
would
have
been
divided
among
two
six
lawyers
and
at
least
twelve
account
executives
the
work
therefore
would
actually
have
been
done
by
not
less
than
twenty
secretaries
but
babs
and
cochrane
had
done
it
all
in
the
on
the
way
to
the
ship
he
felt
that
heavy
exhausted
sense
of
relaxation
which
is
not
pleasurable
at
all
babs
annoyed
him
a
little
too
she
was
late
getting
to
the
airlock
and
seemed
breathless
when
she
arrived
the
crunched
and
clanked
and
rumbled
over
the
gently
undulating
lava
sea
beneath
its
giant
wheels
babs
looked
zestfully
out
of
the
windows
the
picture
was
of
course
quite
incredible
in
the
relatively
dim
earthlight
the
moonscape
was
somehow
softened
and
yet
the
impossibly
jagged
mountains
and
steep
cliffsides
and
the
passes
of
monstrous
stone
these
things
remained
daunting
it
was
like
riding
through
a
dream
in
which
everything
nearby
seemed
fey
and
glamorous
but
the
background
was
and
ominous
there
were
the
usual
noises
inside
the
jeep
the
air
had
a
metallic
smell
one
could
detect
the
odors
of
oil
and
ozone
and
varnish
and
plastic
upholstery
there
were
the
crunching
sounds
of
the
wheels
traveling
over
stone
there
was
the
paradoxic
gentleness
of
all
the
jeep
motions
because
of
the
low
gravity
cochrane
even
noted
the
extraordinary
feel
of
an
upholstered
seat
when
one
weighs
only
as
much
as
back
on
earth
all
his
sensations
were
dreamlike
but
he
felt
that
headachy
exhaustion
that
comes
of
overwork
too
long
continued
i
try
he
said
tiredly
to
see
that
you
have
some
fun
before
you
go
back
babs
you
go
back
as
soon
as
we
dive
off
into
whatever
diving
into
but
you
ought
to
get
in
the
regular
tourist
stuff
up
here
anyhow
babs
said
nothing
pointedly
the
clanked
and
rumbled
onward
the
hissing
of
steam
was
audible
the
vehicle
swung
around
a
pinnacle
of
stone
and
cochrane
saw
the
in
the
pale
earthlight
it
was
singularly
beautiful
it
had
been
designed
to
lure
investors
in
a
promotion
it
was
and
gigantic
and
it
glittered
like
silver
it
stood
upright
on
its
and
it
had
lighted
ports
and
electric
lights
burned
in
the
emptiness
about
it
but
there
was
only
one
at
its
base
a
figure
moved
toward
a
dangling
sling
and
sat
in
it
he
rose
deliberately
toward
an
open
and
the
other
moved
soundlessly
away
back
toward
lunar
city
there
was
no
debris
about
there
was
no
cargo
waiting
to
be
loaded
cochrane
did
see
a
great
metal
plate
tilted
on
the
ground
with
a
large
box
attached
to
it
by
cables
that
would
be
the
generators
and
the
for
a
dabney
field
it
was
plainly
to
remain
on
the
moon
it
was
not
underneath
the
ship
cochrane
puzzled
tiredly
over
it
for
a
moment
then
he
understood
the
ship
would
lift
on
its
rockets
hover
over
the
plate
which
would
be
generating
its
half
of
the
field
and
then
jones
would
switch
on
the
apparatus
in
the
ship
itself
the
forward
nose
of
the
ship
would
become
another
generator
of
the
dabney
field
the
ship
inertia
in
that
field
would
be
effectively
reduced
to
a
fraction
of
its
former
value
the
rockets
which
might
give
it
an
acceleration
of
a
few
hundred
feet
per
second
anywhere
but
in
a
dabney
field
would
immediately
accelerate
the
ship
and
all
its
contents
to
an
otherwise
unattainable
velocity
the
occupants
of
the
rocket
would
lose
their
relative
inertia
to
the
same
degree
as
the
ship
they
should
feel
no
more
acceleration
than
from
the
same
in
normal
space
but
they
would
travel
cochrane
felt
that
there
was
a
fallacy
somehow
in
the
working
of
the
dabney
field
as
he
understood
it
if
there
was
less
inertia
in
the
dabney
field
why
a
rocket
should
push
as
hard
in
it
because
it
was
the
inertia
of
the
that
gave
the
but
cochrane
was
much
too
tired
to
work
out
a
theoretic
objection
to
something
he
knew
did
work
he
was
almost
dozing
when
babs
touched
his
arm
mr
cochrane
he
got
wearily
into
the
clumsy
costume
but
he
saw
again
that
babs
wore
the
look
of
rapturous
adventure
that
he
had
seen
her
wear
before
they
got
out
of
the
one
after
the
other
the
sling
came
down
the
gleaming
side
they
got
in
it
together
it
lifted
them
the
vast
polished
hull
of
the
slid
past
them
only
ten
feet
away
the
ground
diminished
they
seemed
less
to
be
lifted
than
to
float
skyward
and
in
this
sling
in
this
completely
unreal
ascent
cochrane
roused
suddenly
he
felt
the
acute
unease
which
comes
of
height
he
had
looked
down
upon
earth
from
a
height
of
four
thousand
miles
with
no
feeling
of
dizziness
he
had
looked
at
earth
a
miles
away
with
no
consciousness
of
depth
but
a
mere
fifty
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
moon
he
felt
like
somebody
swinging
out
of
a
skyscraper
window
then
the
airlock
opening
was
beside
them
and
the
sling
rolled
inward
they
were
in
the
lock
and
cochrane
found
himself
pushing
babs
away
from
the
unrailed
opening
he
was
relieved
when
the
airlock
closed
inside
the
ship
with
the
off
there
was
light
and
warmth
and
a
remarkably
atmosphere
the
ship
had
been
built
to
sell
stock
in
a
scheme
for
colonizing
mars
prospective
investors
had
been
shown
through
it
it
had
been
designed
to
be
a
convincing
of
space
it
was
but
cochrane
found
himself
not
needed
for
any
consultation
and
jones
was
busy
and
bill
holden
highly
preoccupied
he
saw
alicia
keith
but
her
name
was
simms
now
she
smiled
at
him
but
took
babs
by
the
arm
they
went
off
somewhere
cochrane
waited
for
somebody
to
tell
him
what
to
look
at
and
to
admire
he
saw
jamison
and
bell
and
he
saw
a
man
he
had
not
seen
before
he
settled
down
in
a
deeply
upholstered
chair
he
felt
neglected
everybody
was
busy
but
mostly
he
felt
tired
he
slept
then
babs
was
shaking
his
arm
her
eyes
shining
mr
cochrane
she
cried
urgently
cochrane
wake
up
go
on
up
to
the
we
going
to
take
off
he
blinked
at
her
we
then
he
started
up
and
went
five
feet
into
the
air
from
the
violence
of
his
uncalculated
movement
we
no
you
do
you
go
back
to
lunar
city
where
you
be
safe
then
he
heard
a
peculiar
drumming
rumbling
noise
he
had
heard
it
before
in
the
moonship
it
was
rockets
being
tested
being
burned
rockets
in
the
very
last
seconds
of
preparation
before
for
the
stars
he
did
drop
back
to
the
floor
beside
the
chair
he
occupied
the
floor
rose
to
meet
him
i
had
our
baggage
brought
on
board
said
babs
happily
i
going
because
i
a
stockholder
hold
on
to
something
and
climb
those
stairs
if
you
want
to
see
us
go
up
i
going
to
be
busy
chapter
five
the
physical
sensations
of
ascending
to
the
ship
were
weird
in
the
extreme
cochrane
had
just
been
wakened
from
a
sleep
and
it
was
always
startling
on
the
moon
to
wake
and
find
self
weighing
of
normal
it
took
seconds
to
remember
how
one
got
that
way
but
on
the
way
up
the
stairs
cochrane
was
further
confused
by
the
fact
that
the
ship
was
surging
this
way
and
swaying
that
it
moved
above
the
moon
surface
to
get
over
the
tilted
flat
dabney
field
plate
on
the
ground
a
hundred
yards
from
the
original
position
the
dabney
field
obviously
was
not
in
being
the
ship
hovered
on
its
rockets
they
had
been
designed
to
lift
it
off
of
earth
and
they
had
against
six
times
the
effective
gravity
here
and
with
an
acceleration
of
more
gravities
on
top
of
that
so
the
ship
rose
lightly
almost
skittishly
when
gyros
turned
to
make
it
drift
sidewise
as
a
helicopter
tilts
in
earth
atmosphere
it
fairly
swooped
to
a
new
position
somebody
jockeyed
it
this
way
and
that
cochrane
got
to
the
by
holding
on
with
both
hands
to
railings
he
was
angry
and
appalled
the
was
a
hemisphere
with
vertical
picturing
the
stars
overhead
jones
stood
in
an
odd
sort
of
harness
beside
a
set
of
that
did
not
match
the
smoothly
designed
other
controls
of
the
ship
he
looked
out
of
a
plastic
blister
by
which
he
could
see
around
and
below
the
ship
he
made
urgent
signals
to
a
man
cochrane
had
never
seen
before
who
sat
in
a
before
many
other
complex
controls
with
his
hands
playing
back
and
forth
upon
them
a
loudspeaker
blatted
unmusically
it
was
dabney
voice
highly
agitated
and
uneasy
my
work
for
the
advancement
of
science
has
been
applied
by
other
minds
i
need
to
specify
that
if
the
experiment
now
about
to
begin
does
not
succeed
it
will
not
invalidate
my
discovery
which
has
been
amply
verified
by
other
means
it
may
be
indeed
that
my
discovery
is
so
far
ahead
of
present
engineering
see
here
raged
cochrane
you
ca
take
off
with
babs
on
board
this
is
dangerous
nobody
paid
any
attention
jones
made
frantic
gestures
to
indicate
the
most
delicate
of
adjustments
the
man
in
the
obeyed
the
instruction
with
an
absorbed
attention
jones
suddenly
threw
a
switch
something
lighted
somewhere
there
was
a
momentary
throbbing
sound
which
was
not
quite
a
sound
take
it
away
said
jones
in
a
flat
voice
the
man
in
the
pressed
hard
on
the
controls
cochrane
glanced
desperately
out
of
one
of
the
side
ports
he
saw
the
moonscape
the
frozen
lava
sea
with
its
layer
of
moondust
he
saw
many
gathered
near
as
if
most
of
the
population
of
lunar
city
had
been
gathered
to
watch
this
event
he
saw
the
extraordinary
nearness
of
the
moon
horizon
but
it
was
the
most
momentary
of
glimpses
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
roar
a
protest
he
felt
the
upward
curiously
comforting
thrust
of
acceleration
to
one
full
the
moonscape
was
snatched
away
from
beneath
the
ship
it
did
not
descend
the
ship
did
not
seem
to
rise
the
moon
itself
diminished
and
vanished
like
a
pricked
bubble
the
speed
of
its
disappearance
was
not
it
specifically
was
not
attributable
to
one
of
lift
applied
on
a
moon
the
loudspeaker
hiccoughed
and
was
silent
cochrane
uttered
the
roar
he
had
started
before
the
added
acceleration
began
but
it
was
useless
out
the
he
saw
the
stars
they
were
not
still
and
changeless
and
winking
as
they
appeared
from
the
moon
these
stars
seemed
to
stir
uneasily
to
shift
ever
so
slightly
among
themselves
like
flecks
of
bright
color
drifting
on
a
breeze
jones
said
in
an
interested
voice
now
we
try
the
booster
he
threw
another
switch
and
again
there
was
a
momentary
throbbing
sound
which
was
not
quite
a
sound
it
was
actually
a
sensation
which
one
seemed
to
feel
all
through
one
body
it
lasted
only
the
fraction
of
a
second
but
while
it
lasted
the
stars
out
the
ceased
to
be
stars
they
became
little
lines
of
light
all
moving
toward
the
stern
but
at
varying
rates
of
speed
some
of
them
passed
beyond
view
some
of
them
moved
only
a
little
but
all
shifted
then
they
were
again
tiny
spots
of
light
of
innumerable
tints
and
colors
of
every
conceivably
degree
of
brightness
stirring
and
moving
with
relation
to
each
other
the
devil
said
cochrane
raging
jones
turned
to
him
and
jones
was
not
quite
now
not
quite
he
looked
even
pleased
then
his
face
went
back
to
impassiveness
again
it
worked
he
said
mildly
i
know
it
worked
sputtered
cochrane
but
where
are
we
how
far
did
we
come
i
have
the
least
idea
said
jones
mildly
as
before
does
it
matter
cochrane
glared
at
him
then
he
realized
how
completely
too
late
it
was
to
protest
anything
the
man
he
had
seen
absorbed
in
the
handling
of
controls
now
lifted
his
hands
from
the
board
the
rockets
died
there
was
a
vast
silence
and
weightlessness
cochrane
weighed
nothing
this
was
free
flight
again
like
practically
all
of
the
hours
from
the
space
platform
to
the
moon
the
pilot
left
the
controls
and
in
an
accustomed
fashion
soared
to
a
port
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
he
gazed
out
and
then
behind
and
said
in
a
tone
of
astonished
satisfaction
this
is
good
there
the
sun
how
far
asked
jones
it
fifth
magnitude
said
the
pilot
happily
we
really
did
pile
on
the
horses
jones
looked
momentarily
pleased
again
cochrane
said
in
a
voice
that
even
to
himself
sounded
outraged
you
mean
the
sun
a
star
from
here
what
the
devil
happened
booster
said
jones
nearly
with
enthusiasm
when
the
field
was
just
a
radiation
i
used
forty
milliamperes
of
current
to
the
square
centimetre
of
that
was
the
when
we
sent
the
across
the
crater
for
the
test
i
stepped
the
up
i
used
a
tenth
of
an
ampere
per
square
centimetre
i
told
you
and
do
you
remember
that
i
wondered
what
would
happen
if
i
used
a
system
cochrane
held
fast
to
a
the
more
power
you
put
into
your
infernal
field
he
demanded
the
more
speed
you
get
jones
said
contentedly
there
a
limit
it
depends
on
the
temperature
of
the
things
in
the
field
but
i
fixed
up
the
field
now
like
a
outfit
like
a
we
took
off
with
a
light
field
it
on
now
we
have
to
keep
it
on
but
i
got
hold
of
some
pretty
storage
condensers
i
hooked
them
up
in
parallel
to
get
a
momentary
surge
of
current
when
i
shorted
them
through
my
coils
could
make
it
a
steady
current
everything
would
blow
but
i
had
a
surge
of
probably
six
amps
per
square
centimetre
for
a
while
cochrane
swallowed
the
field
was
sixty
times
as
strong
as
the
one
the
used
we
went
we
going
sixty
times
as
fast
we
had
lots
more
speed
than
that
but
then
jones
enthusiasm
dwindled
i
have
had
time
to
check
he
said
unhappily
it
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
get
at
right
away
but
in
theory
the
field
should
modify
the
effect
of
inertia
as
the
fourth
power
of
its
strength
sixty
to
the
fourth
is
how
far
demanded
cochrane
is
proxima
centaurus
that
the
nearest
star
to
earth
how
near
did
we
come
to
reaching
it
the
pilot
on
the
other
side
of
the
said
with
a
trace
less
than
his
former
zest
that
looks
like
sirius
over
there
we
did
head
for
proxima
centaurus
said
jones
mildly
it
too
close
and
we
have
to
keep
the
back
on
the
moon
lined
up
with
us
more
or
less
so
we
headed
out
roughly
along
the
moon
axis
toward
where
its
north
pole
points
then
where
are
we
headed
where
are
we
going
we
not
going
anywhere
just
yet
said
jones
without
interest
we
have
to
find
out
where
we
are
and
from
that
cochrane
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
look
he
protested
who
running
this
show
you
did
tell
me
you
were
going
to
take
off
you
did
pick
out
a
destination
you
did
jones
said
very
patiently
we
have
to
try
out
the
ship
we
have
to
find
out
how
fast
it
goes
with
how
much
field
and
how
much
we
have
to
find
out
how
far
we
went
and
if
it
was
in
a
straight
line
we
even
have
to
find
out
how
to
land
the
ship
a
new
piece
of
apparatus
we
ca
do
things
with
it
until
we
find
out
what
it
can
do
cochrane
stared
at
him
then
he
swallowed
i
see
he
said
the
financial
and
business
department
of
spaceways
has
done
its
stuff
for
the
time
being
jones
nodded
the
technical
staff
now
takes
over
jones
nodded
again
i
still
think
said
cochrane
that
we
could
have
done
with
a
little
interdepartmental
cooperation
how
long
before
you
know
what
about
jones
shook
his
head
i
ca
even
guess
ask
babs
to
come
up
here
will
you
cochrane
threw
up
his
hands
he
went
toward
the
that
led
below
he
went
down
into
the
main
saloon
a
tiny
green
light
winked
on
and
off
urgently
on
the
far
side
babs
was
seated
at
a
tiny
board
there
as
cochrane
looked
she
pushed
buttons
with
professional
skill
bill
holden
sat
in
a
with
his
face
a
greenish
hue
we
took
off
said
holden
in
a
strained
voice
we
did
said
cochrane
and
the
sun
a
fifth
magnitude
star
from
where
we
got
to
which
is
no
place
in
particular
and
i
just
found
out
that
we
started
off
at
random
and
jones
and
the
pilot
he
picked
up
are
now
happily
about
to
do
some
research
holden
closed
his
eyes
when
you
want
to
cheer
me
up
he
said
feebly
you
can
tell
me
about
to
crash
somewhere
and
this
misery
will
soon
be
over
cochrane
said
bitterly
taking
off
without
a
destination
letting
babs
come
along
they
know
how
far
we
come
and
they
do
know
where
we
going
this
is
a
hell
of
a
way
to
run
a
business
who
called
it
a
business
asked
holden
as
feebly
as
before
it
started
out
as
a
psychiatric
treatment
babs
voice
came
from
the
side
of
the
saloon
where
she
sat
at
a
and
microphone
she
was
saying
professionally
i
assure
you
it
true
we
are
linked
to
you
by
the
dabney
field
in
which
radiation
travels
much
faster
than
light
when
you
were
a
little
boy
did
you
ever
put
a
string
between
two
tin
cans
and
then
talk
along
the
string
cochrane
stopped
beside
her
scowling
she
looked
up
the
press
association
men
on
luna
cochrane
they
saw
us
take
off
and
the
radar
verified
that
we
traveled
some
hundred
of
thousands
of
miles
but
then
we
simply
vanished
they
do
understand
how
they
can
talk
to
us
without
even
the
between
earth
and
lunar
city
i
was
explaining
i
take
it
said
cochrane
jones
wants
you
in
the
cameras
who
was
handling
the
cameras
bell
said
babs
briskly
it
his
hobby
along
with
and
children
tell
him
to
get
some
pictures
of
the
around
us
said
cochrane
and
then
you
can
see
what
jones
wants
i
will
do
a
little
business
he
settled
down
in
the
seat
babs
had
vacated
he
faced
the
two
reporters
in
the
screen
they
had
seen
the
ship
take
off
it
was
verified
beyond
any
reasonable
question
the
microwave
beam
to
earth
was
working
at
capacity
to
transmit
statements
from
the
moon
observatory
which
annoyedly
conceded
that
the
spaceways
salvaged
ship
had
taken
off
with
an
acceleration
beyond
belief
but
the
astronomers
said
firmly
the
ship
and
all
its
contents
must
necessarily
have
been
destroyed
by
the
shock
of
their
departure
the
acceleration
must
have
been
as
great
as
the
shock
of
a
meteor
hitting
luna
you
can
consider
cochrane
told
them
that
i
am
now
an
angel
if
you
like
but
how
about
getting
a
statement
from
dabney
a
man
back
on
luna
uttered
the
first
profanity
ever
to
travel
faster
than
light
all
he
can
talk
about
he
said
savagely
is
how
wonderful
he
is
he
agrees
with
the
observatory
that
you
must
all
be
dead
he
said
so
can
you
give
us
any
evidence
that
you
alive
and
out
in
space
visual
evidence
for
broadcast
at
this
moment
the
entire
fabric
of
the
moved
slightly
there
was
no
sound
of
rockets
the
ship
seemed
to
turn
a
little
but
that
was
all
no
gravity
no
acceleration
it
was
a
singularly
uncomfortable
sensation
on
top
of
the
discomfort
of
weightlessness
cochrane
said
sardonically
if
you
ca
take
my
word
that
i
alive
i
try
to
get
you
some
proof
hm
i
send
you
some
pictures
of
the
around
us
shoot
them
to
observatories
back
on
earth
and
let
them
figure
out
for
themselves
where
we
are
displacement
of
the
relative
positions
of
the
stars
ought
to
let
them
figure
things
out
he
left
the
holden
still
looked
greenish
in
his
the
main
saloon
was
otherwise
empty
cochrane
made
his
way
gingerly
to
the
stair
going
below
he
stepped
into
thin
air
and
descended
by
a
pull
on
the
this
was
the
the
ship
having
been
built
to
impress
investors
in
a
enterprise
it
had
been
beautifully
equipped
with
trimmings
and
having
had
to
rise
from
earth
to
luna
and
needing
to
take
an
acceleration
of
a
good
many
gravities
it
had
necessarily
to
be
reasonably
it
had
had
in
fact
to
be
an
honest
job
of
in
order
to
put
across
a
phoney
promotion
but
there
were
trimmings
that
could
have
been
spared
the
ports
opening
upon
emptiness
for
example
were
not
really
practical
arrangements
but
everybody
but
holden
and
the
two
men
in
the
now
clustered
at
those
ports
looking
out
at
the
stars
there
was
jamison
and
bell
the
writer
and
johnny
simms
and
his
wife
babs
had
been
here
and
gone
bell
was
busy
with
a
camera
as
cochrane
moved
to
tell
him
of
the
need
for
to
prove
to
a
waiting
planet
that
they
were
alive
johnny
simms
turned
and
saw
cochrane
his
expression
was
amiable
and
unawed
hello
said
johnny
simms
cheerfully
cochrane
nodded
curtly
i
bought
west
stock
in
spaceways
said
johnny
simms
amusedly
because
i
want
to
come
along
right
so
i
heard
said
cochrane
as
curtly
as
before
west
said
johnny
simms
told
him
gleefully
that
he
was
going
back
to
earth
punch
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
on
their
separate
noses
and
then
go
down
to
south
carolina
and
raise
edible
snails
for
the
rest
of
his
life
an
understandable
ambition
said
cochrane
he
frowned
waiting
to
talk
to
bell
who
was
taking
an
infernally
long
time
to
focus
a
camera
out
of
a
it
going
to
be
good
when
he
tries
to
cash
my
check
said
johnny
simms
delightedly
i
stopped
payment
on
it
when
he
would
pick
up
the
tab
for
some
drinks
i
invited
him
to
have
cochrane
forced
his
face
to
impassiveness
johnny
simms
was
that
way
he
understood
he
was
a
psychopathic
personality
he
was
completely
insensitive
to
notions
of
ethics
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
were
as
completely
meaningless
to
him
as
tones
to
a
person
or
pastel
tints
to
a
man
who
is
they
simply
did
register
his
mind
was
up
to
par
and
he
could
be
a
charming
companion
he
could
experience
the
most
kindly
of
emotions
and
most
generous
of
impulses
which
he
put
into
practice
but
he
also
had
a
normal
person
impulse
to
less
admirable
behavior
and
he
simply
could
not
understand
that
there
was
any
difference
between
impulses
he
put
the
unpleasing
ones
into
practice
too
he
been
on
the
moon
to
avoid
extradition
because
of
past
impulses
which
society
called
murderous
on
this
ship
it
was
yet
to
be
discovered
what
he
would
do
but
because
he
was
technically
sane
his
lawyers
could
have
prevented
a
take
off
unless
he
came
along
cochrane
at
the
moment
felt
an
impulse
to
heave
him
out
an
airlock
as
a
probable
danger
but
cochrane
was
not
a
psychopathic
personality
he
stopped
bell
in
his
and
looked
at
the
first
of
the
prints
they
were
excellent
he
went
back
to
the
to
transmit
them
back
to
luna
he
sent
them
off
they
would
be
forwarded
to
observatories
on
earth
and
inspected
they
literally
could
not
be
faked
there
were
thousands
of
stars
on
each
print
with
the
milky
way
for
background
on
some
and
each
of
those
thousands
of
stars
would
be
identified
and
each
would
have
changed
its
relative
position
from
that
seen
on
earth
with
relation
to
every
other
star
astronomers
could
detect
the
spot
from
which
the
picture
had
been
taken
but
to
fake
a
single
print
would
have
required
years
of
computation
and
almost
certainly
there
would
have
been
somewhere
these
pictures
were
unassailable
evidence
that
a
human
expedition
had
reached
a
point
in
space
that
had
been
beyond
all
human
dreaming
then
cochrane
had
nothing
to
do
he
was
a
supernumerary
member
of
the
crew
the
pilot
and
jones
were
in
charge
of
the
ship
jamison
would
take
care
of
the
catering
when
came
probably
alicia
keith
no
alicia
simms
would
help
nothing
else
needed
attention
the
rockets
either
worked
or
they
did
the
needed
no
supervision
cochrane
found
himself
without
a
function
he
went
restlessly
back
to
the
he
found
babs
looking
helpless
and
jones
staring
blankly
at
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hands
while
the
pilot
was
still
at
a
staring
at
the
stars
through
one
of
those
squat
thick
telescopes
used
on
luna
for
the
examination
of
the
planets
how
goes
the
research
asked
cochrane
we
stumped
said
jones
painfully
i
forgot
something
what
whenever
i
wanted
anything
said
jones
i
wrote
it
out
and
gave
a
memo
to
babs
she
attended
to
it
my
system
exactly
admitted
cochrane
i
wrote
out
a
memo
for
her
said
jones
unhappily
asking
for
and
for
her
to
get
somebody
to
set
up
a
system
of
astrogation
for
outside
the
solar
system
nobody
ever
bothered
to
do
that
before
nobody
ever
reached
even
mars
but
i
figured
we
need
it
cochrane
waited
jones
showed
him
a
creased
bit
of
paper
closely
written
i
wrote
out
the
memo
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
said
jones
and
i
forgot
to
give
it
to
babs
so
we
ca
astrogate
we
do
know
how
we
did
get
either
or
instructions
we
lost
cochrane
waited
apparently
al
was
mistaken
in
the
star
he
spotted
as
our
sun
added
jones
he
referred
to
the
pilot
whom
cochrane
had
not
met
before
anyhow
we
ca
find
it
again
we
turned
the
ship
to
look
at
some
more
stars
and
we
ca
pick
it
out
any
more
cochrane
said
you
keep
looking
of
course
for
what
asked
jones
he
waved
his
hand
out
the
four
plastic
from
where
he
stood
cochrane
could
see
thousands
of
thousands
of
stars
out
those
four
small
openings
they
were
of
every
conceivable
color
and
degree
of
brightness
the
milky
way
was
like
a
band
of
diamonds
we
know
the
sun
a
yellow
star
said
jones
but
we
do
know
how
bright
it
should
be
or
what
the
sky
should
look
like
beyond
it
constellations
asked
cochrane
find
said
jones
vexedly
cochrane
did
try
if
a
pilot
could
not
spot
familiar
a
television
producer
was
likely
to
see
them
and
it
was
obvious
once
one
thought
that
the
brighter
stars
seen
from
earth
would
be
mostly
the
nearer
ones
if
jones
was
right
in
his
guess
that
his
booster
had
increased
the
speed
of
the
ship
by
sixty
to
the
fourth
power
it
would
have
gone
some
millions
of
times
as
fast
as
the
for
a
brief
period
the
ratio
was
actually
something
over
nineteen
million
times
and
it
happened
that
nobody
had
been
able
to
measure
the
speed
of
that
cochrane
was
no
mathematician
but
he
could
see
that
there
was
no
data
for
computation
on
hand
after
one
found
out
how
fast
an
acceleration
of
one
in
a
dabney
field
of
strength
speeded
up
a
ship
something
like
dead
reckoning
could
be
managed
but
all
that
could
be
known
right
now
was
that
they
had
come
a
long
way
he
remembered
a
television
show
he
produced
laid
in
space
on
an
imaginary
voyage
the
had
had
one
of
the
characters
say
that
no
constellation
would
be
visible
at
a
hundred
from
the
solar
system
it
would
be
rather

he
escaped
from
from

block
away
with
no
memories
of
the
flight
from
it
cochrane
said
suddenly
in
a
pleased
tone
this
is
a
pretty
good
break
if
we
can
keep
them
from
finding
out
about
it
back
home
we
have
an
entirely
new
program
good
for
a
sequence
on
just
this
babs
stared
at
him
main
set
this
said
cochrane
enthusiastically
get
a
scientist
back
home
with
a
panel
of
experts
discuss
our
problems
here
we
navigate
from
home
with
the
whole
business
on
the
air
we
have
up
to
a
record
everybody
on
earth
will
feel
like
he
here
with
us
sharing
our
problems
jones
said
irritably
you
do
get
it
we
lost
we
ca
check
our
speed
without
knowing
where
we
are
and
how
far
we
come
we
ca
find
out
what
the
ship
will
do
when
we
ca
find
out
what
it
done
do
you
see
cochrane
said
patiently
i
know
but
we
in
touch
with
luna
through
the
dabney
field
that
got
us
here
it
transmitted
radiation
before
faster
than
light
transmitting
voice
and
pictures
now
now
we
set
up
a
television
show
which
pays
for
our
astrogation
and
lets
the
world
sit
in
on
the
prettier
aspects
of
our
travels
hm
how
long
before
you
can
sit
down
on
a
planet
after
you
have
all
the
navigational
aids
of
say
the
four
best
observatories
on
earth
to
help
you

arrange

he
went
happily
down
the
stairs
again
this
was
a
spiral
stair
and
he
zestfully
spun
around
it
as
he
went
to
the
next
deck
below
at
the
bottom
he
called
up
to
babs

along
to

need
some
legal

for
the
biggest
deal
in
the
history
of
advertising
made
at
several
times
the
speed
of
light
and
he
went
zestfully
to
the
communicator
to
set
it
up
and
time
passed
data
arrived
which
at
once
solved
jones
and
the
pilot
problem
of
where
they
were
and
how
far
they
had
come
it
was
actually
and
they
spent
an
hour
making
further
tests
and
getting
further
determinations
and
then
they
got
a
destination
they
stopped
in
space
to
extrude
from
the
airlock
a
small
package
which
expanded
into
a
plastic
balloon
with
a
minute
atomic
battery
attached
to
it
the
plastic
was
an
electric
conductor
it
was
a
of
the
dabney
field
it
took
over
the
field
from
earth
and
maintained
it
it
provided
a
second
field
for
the
ship
to
maintain
the
ship
then
could
move
at
any
angle
from
the
balloon
the
dabney
field
stretched
through
emptiness
to
the
balloon
and
then
at
any
desired
direction
to
the
ship
the
ship
rockets
thrust
again
and
the
came
into
play
there
were
maneuverings
a
second
balloon
was
put
out
in
space
at
central
time
on
a
period
relinquished
by
other
advertisers
bought
out
a
new
program
went
on
the

it
was
a
show
sponsored
by
the
intercity
credit
corporation
buy
on
credit
guaranteed
with
ten
straight
minutes
of
commercials
interjected
in
four
sections
it
was
the
show
ever
put
on
the
air
it
showed
the
interior
of
the
ship
with
occasional
brief
switches
to
authoritative
persons
on
earth
for
comment
on
what
was
relayed
from
the
skies
the
first
broadcast
ensured
the
success
of
the
program
beyond
possible
dispute
it
started
with
curt
conversation
between
jones
and
the
pilot
al
jones
loathed
this
part
of
it
but
al
turned
out
to
be
something
of
a
ham
on
the
problems
of
approaching
a
new
solar

cut
to

back
on

on
its

from

the

panned

was
a

the

it
it
swelled

as
the

cochrane
stood
out
of
and
acted
as
director
as
well
as
producer
of
the
opus
he
used
even
johnny
simms
as
an
offstage
voice
repeating
stern
commands
it
was
corny
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
it
had
a
large
content
of
ham
but
it
happened
to
be
authentic
the
ship
had
reached
another
planet
with
vast
and
what
appeared
to
be
no
more
than
a
equatorial
belt
where
there
was
less
than
complete
glaciation
the
rockets
roared
and
boomed
as
the
ship
let
down
into
the
television
audiences
back
on
earth
viewed
the
new
planet
nearly
as
soon
as
did
those
in
the
ship
the
was
roughly
three
seconds
for
a
distance
of
the
surface
of
the
planet
was
wild
and
dramatic
beyond
belief
there
were
valleys
where
vegetation
grew
luxuriantly
there
were
ranges
of
mountains
interpenetrating
the
equatorial
strip
and
there
were
masses
of
white
which
as
the
ship
descended
could
be
identified
as
glaciers
moving
down
toward
the
vegetation
but
as
the
ship
sank
lower
and
lower
and
the
sound
of
its
rockets
became
thunderous
because
of
the
atmosphere
around
it
a
new
feature
took
over
the
central
position
in
one
concept
of
what
the
planet
was
actually
like
the
planet
was
volcanic
there
were
smoking
cones
everywhere
in
the
among
the
in
between
the
glaciers
and
even
among
the
tumbled
areas
whose
greenness
proved
that
here
was
an
environment
which
might
be
perilous
but
where
life
should
thrive
abundantly
the
ship
continued
to
descend
toward
a
great
forest

a
terminal
moraine
chapter

jamison
declaimed
wearing
a
as
bell
zestfully
panned
his
camera
and
the
ship
swung
down
it
was
an
impressive
broadcast
the
rockets
roared
with
the
coming
of
air
about
the
ship
they
no
longer
made
a
mere
rumbling
they
created
a
tumult
which
was
like
the
growl
of
thunder
if
one
were
in
the
midst
of
the
it
was
a
numbing
noise
it
was
almost
a
paralyzing
noise
but
jamison
talked
with
professional
smoothness
this
planet
he
orated
while
pictures
from
bell
camera
went
direct
to
the
transmitter
below
this
planet
is
the
first
world
other
than
earth
on
which
a
human
ship
has
landed
it
is
paradoxic
that
before
men
have
walked
on
mars
red
plains
and
breathed
its
thin
cold
air
or
fought
for
life
in
the
formaldehyde
gales
of
venus
that
they
should
look
upon
a
world
which
welcomes
them
from
illimitable
remoteness
here
we
descend
and
all
mankind
can
watch
our
descent
upon
a
world
whose
vegetation
is
green
whose
glaciers
prove
that
there
is
air
and
water
in
plenty
whose
very
smoking
volcanoes
assure
us
of
its
close
kinship
to
earth
he
lifted
the
mike
away
from
his
throat
and
framed
words
with
his
lips
i
still
on

nodded
cochrane
wore

carrying
what
the
communicator
carried
as
this
broadcast
went
through
an
angled
dabney

back
to

and
then
to

he
spoke
close
to

if
your
voice
fades
it
will
be
the
best
possible
suspense
good
television
jamison
let
the
back
against
his
skin
the
roaring
of
the
rockets
would
affect
it
only
as
his
throat
vibrated
from
the
sound
it
would
register
even
so
i
see
said
jamison
above
the
forests
of
giant
trees
like
the
sequoias
of
mother
earth
i
see
rushing
rivers
foaming
along
their
rocky
beds
taking
their
rise
in
glaciers
we
are
still
too
high
to
look
for
living
creatures
but
we
descend
swiftly
now
we
are
level
with
the
highest
of
the
mountains
now
we
descend
below
their
smoking
tops
under
us
there
is
a
vast
valley
miles
wide
leagues
long
here
a
city
could
be
built
over
it
looms
a
gigantic
capped
with
green
one
would
expect
a
castle
to
be
built
there
he
raised
his
eyebrows
at
cochrane
they
were
well
in
atmosphere
now
and
it
had
been
an
obvious
defect
condition
necessity
of
the
dabney
field
that
both
of
its
plates
should
be
in
a
vacuum
one
was
certainly
in
air
now
but
cochrane
made
that
gesture
which
in
television
informs
the
actors
that
time
to
cutting
is
measured
in
tens
of
seconds
and
he
held
up
two
fingers
twenty
seconds
we
gaze
and
you
gaze
with
us
said
jamison
upon
a
world
that
future
generations
will
come
to
know
as
home
the
site
of
the
first
human
colony
among
the

cochrane
began
to
beat

we
are
about
to

jamison
declaimed
we
do
not
know
what
we

that
he
paused
dramatically
a
living
creature
a
living
creature
sighted
down
below
we
sign
off
now
from
the
stars
the
ending
had
been
perfectly
timed
allowing
for
a
interval
for
the
broadcast
to
reach
the
moon
and
just
about
two
more
for
it
to
be
relayed
to
earth
his
final
word
stars
had
been
uttered
at
the
precise
instant
to
allow
a
commercial
by
intercity
credit
in
the
united
states
by

in

by
fabricanos

in

and
near

oil
along

at
the
end
of
that
four
minutes
it
would
be
time
for
station
identification
and
a
and
the
divers
flashes
before
other
programs
came
on
the
air
the
rockets
roared
and
thundered
the
ship
went
down
and
down
jamison
said
i
thought
we
be
cut
off
when
we
hit
air
that
what
jones
thought
cochrane
assured
him
he
bellowed
above
the
outside
tumult
bell
see
anything
alive
down
below
bell
shook
his
head
he
stayed
at
the
camera
aimed
out
a
storing
up
for
later
use
there
was
the
feel
of
gravitation
now
actually
it
was
the
fact
that
the
ship
slowed
swiftly
in
its
descent
cochrane
went
to
a
port
the
ship
continued
its
descent
living
creature
where
jamison
shrugged
he
had
used
it
as
a
line
an
extrapolation
from
the
fact
that
there
was
vegetation
below
he
looked
somehow
distastefully
out
the
port
at
a
swiftly
rising
green
ground
below
he
was
a
city
man
he
had
literally
never
before
seen
what
looked
like
habitable
territory
of
such
vast
extent
with
no
houses
on
it
in
a
valley
easily
ten
miles
long
and
two
wide
there
was
not
a
square
inch
of
concrete
or
of
glass
there
was
not
a
man
made
object
in
view
the
sky
was
blue
and
there
were
clouds
but
to
jamison
the
sight
of
vegetation
implied
rooftops
there
ought
to
be
parapets
where
roofs
ended
to
let
light
down
to
windows
and
streets
below
he
had
never
before
seen
grass
save
on
elevated
nor
bushes
not
arranged
as
landscaping
and
certainly
not
trees
other
than
the
domesticated
growths
which
can
grow
on
the
tops
of
buildings
to
jamison
this
was
desolation
on
the
moon
absence
of
structures
was
understandable
there
was
no
air
but
here
there
should
be
a
city
the
ship
swayed
a
little
as
the
rockets
swung
their
blasts
to
balance
the
descending
mass
the
intended
slowed
and
slowed
and
hovered
and
there
was
terrifying
smoke
and
flame
suddenly
all
about
and
then
there
was
a
distinct
crunching
impact
the
rockets
continued
to
burn
their
ferocity
diminished
they
slackened
again
and
yet
again
they
were
reduced
to
a
mere
faint
murmur
there
was
a
remarkable
immobility
of
everything
it
was
the
result
of
gravity
gravity
or
very
near
it
there
was
a
distinct
pressure
of
one
feet
against
the
floor
and
a
feeling
of
heaviness
to
one
body
which
was
very
different
from
lunar
city
and
more
different
still
from
free
flight
in
emptiness
nothing
but
swirling
masses
of
smoke
could
be
seen
out
the
ports
they
had
landed
in
a
forest
of
sorts
and
the
had
burned
away
everything
underneath
down
to
solid
soil
in
a
circle
forty
yards
about
the
ship
the
ground
was
a
mass
of
smoking
steaming
ash
beyond
that
flames
licked
hungrily
creating
more
dense
vapor
beyond
that
still
there
was
only
coiling
smoke
cochrane
headphones
yielded
babs
voice
almost
wailing
cochrane
we
must
have
landed
i
want
to
see
cochrane
pressed
the
button
are
we
still
hooked
up
to
lunar
city
he
demanded
we
ca
be
but
are
we
said
babs
voice
mutinously
broadcast
went
through
all
right
they
want
to
talk
to
you
everybody
wants
to
talk
to
you
tell
them
to
call
back
later
commanded
cochrane
then
leave
the
beam
working
however
it
works
and
come
up
if
you
like
tell
the
moon
operator
you
be
away
for
ten
minutes
he
continued
to
stare
out
the
window
al
the
pilot
stayed
in
his
cushioned
seat
before
the
bank
of
the
rockets
were
barely
alight
the
ship
stayed
as
it
had
landed
upright
on
its
triple
fins
he
said
to
jones
it
feels
like
we
solid
we
wo
topple
jones
nodded
the
cut
off
nothing
happened
i
think
we
could
have
saved
fuel
on
that
landing
said
jones
then
he
added
pleased
nice
the
dabney
field
still
on
it
has
to
be
started
in
a
vacuum
but
it
looks
like
it
can
hold
air
away
from
itself
once
it
established
nice
babs
rushed
up
the
stairs
she
gazed
impassionedly
out
of
a
then
she
said
disappointedly
it
looks
like
it
looks
like
hell
said
cochrane
just
smoke
and
steam
and
stuff
we
can
hope
though
that
we
have
started
a
forest
fire
but
have
just
burned
off
a
they
stared
out
presently
they
went
to
another
port
and
gazed
out
of
that
the
smoke
was
annoying
and
yet
it
could
have
been
foreseen
a
landing
at
its
on
earth
heated
the
tarmac
to
in
the
process
of
landing
had
to
wait
for
it
to
cool
before
they
could
approach
here
the
ship
had
landed
in
woodland
naturally
its
flames
had
seared
the
spot
where
it
came
down
and
there
was
inflammable
stuff
about
which
caught
fire
so
the
ship
was
in
the
situation
of
a
phoenix
necessarily
nesting
in
a
conflagration
anywhere
it
landed
the
same
thing
would
apply
unless
it
tried
landing
on
a
glacier
but
then
it
would
settle
down
into
a
lake
of
boiling
water
amid
steam
and
could
expect
to
be
frozen
in
as
soon
as
its
cooled
now
there
was
nothing
to
do
they
had
to
wait
once
the
whole
ship
quivered
very
slightly
as
if
the
ground
trembled
faintly
under
it
but
there
was
nothing
at
which
to
be
alarmed
they
could
see
that
this
particular
forest
was
composed
mainly
of
two
kinds
of
trees
which
burned
differently
one
had
a
central
trunk
and
it
burned
with
resinous
flames
and
much
black
and
smoke
the
other
was
a
curious
growth
a
solid
massive
trunk
which
did
not
touch
ground
at
all
but
was
held
up
by
aerial
roots
which
supported
it
aloft
through
very
many
slender
shafts
widely
spread
possibly
the
heavier
part
was
formed
on
the
ground
and
lifted
as
its
grew
it
was
irritating
though
to
be
unable
to
see
from
the
ship
so
long
as
the
fire
burned
outside
the
pall
of
smoke
lasted
for
a
long
time
in
three
hours
there
were
no
longer
any
fiercely
blazing
areas
but
the
ashes
still
smouldered
and
smoke
still
rose
in
three
hours
and
a
half
the
local
sun
began
to
set
there
were
colorings
in
the
sky
beyond
all
comparison
glorious
which
was
logical
enough
when
krakatoa
back
on
earth
blew
itself
to
bits
in
the
eighteen
hundreds
it
sent
such
volumes
of
dust
into
the
air
that
sunsets
all
around
the
globe
were
notably
improved
for
three
years
afterward
on
this
planet
smoking
cones
were
everywhere
visible
volcanic
dust
then
made
nightfall
magnificent
past
description
there
was
not
only
gold
and
crimson
in
the
west
the
zenith
itself
glowed
carmine
and
yellow
and
those
in
the
gazed
up
at
a
sky
such
as
none
of
them
could
have
imagined
possible
the
colors
changed
and
changed
from
yellow
to
gold
all
over
the
sky
and
still
the
glory
continued
presently
there
was
a
deep
deep
red
deep
past
imagining
and
presently
faint
bluish
stars
pierced
it
and
they
stared
up
at
new
strange
very
bright
indeed
and
all
about
the
ship
there
was
a
bed
of
white
ash
with
glowing
embers
in
it
and
a
thin
sheet
of
white
smoke
still
flowed
away
down
the
valley
it
was
long
after
sunset
when
cochrane
got
up
from
the
communicator
communication
with
earth
was
broken
at
last
there
was
a
balloon
out
in
space
somewhere
with
an
atomic
battery
maintaining
all
its
surface
as
a
dabney
field
plate
the
ship
maintained
a
field
between
itself
and
that
plate
the
balloon
maintained
another
field
between
itself
and
another
balloon
a
mere
from
the
solar
system
but
the
substance
of
this
planet
intervened
between
the
nearer
balloon
and
the
ship
jones
made
tests
and
observed
that
the
field
continued
to
exist
but
was
plugged
by
the
matter
of
this
world
come
tomorrow
when
there
was
no
barrier
to
the
passage
of
radiation
they
could
communicate
with
earth
again
but
cochrane
was
weary
and
now
discouraged
so
long
as
talk
with
earth
was
possible
he
kept
at
it
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talking
to
be
done
but
a
good
deal
of
it
was
extremely
unsatisfactory
he
found
bill
holden
having
supper
with
babs
on
the
floor
below
the
communicator
very
much
of
the
recent
talk
had
been
over
head
he
felt
humiliated
by
the
indignation
of
scientists
who
would
not
tell
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
without
previous
information
he
could
not
give
when
he
went
over
to
the
he
felt
that
he
creaked
from
weariness
and
dejection
babs
looked
at
him
solicitously
and
then
jumped
up
to
get
him
something
to
eat
everybody
else
was
again
watching
out
the
ship
ports
at
the
new
strange
world
of
which
they
could
see
next
to
nothing
bill
said
cochrane
fretfully
i
just
been
given
the
of
my
life
you
expecting
to
get
out
of
the
airlock
in
the
morning
and
take
a
walk
but
i
been
talking
to
earth
i
been
given
the
devil
for
landing
on
a
strange
planet
without
bringing
along
a
bacteriologist
an
organic
chemist
an
ecologist
an
epidemiologist
and
a
complete
laboratory
to
test
everything
with
before
daring
to
take
a
breath
of
outside
air
i
warned
not
to
open
a
port
holden
said
you
sound
as
if
you
been
talking
to
a
biologist
with
a
reputation
you
ought
to
know
better
than
that
cochrane
protested
i
wanted
to
talk
to
somebody
who
knew
more
than
i
did
what
could
i
do
but
get
a
man
with
a
reputation
holden
shook
his
head
we
psychiatrists
he
observed
go
around
peeping
under
the
corners
of
rugs
at
what
people
try
to
hide
from
themselves
we
have
a
view
of
humanity
we
know
better
than
to
throw
a
difficult
problem
at
a
man
with
an
established
name
they
neurotic
about
their
reputations
like
dabney
they
get
panicky
at
the
idea
of
anybody
catching
them
in
a
mistake
no
big
name
in
medicine
or
biology
would
dare
tell
you
that
of
course
it
all
right
for
us
to
take
a
walk
in
the
rather
pretty
landscape
outside
then
who
will
demanded
cochrane
we
make
what
tests
we
can
said
holden
comfortingly
and
decide
for
ourselves
we
can
take
a
chance
we
only
risking
our
lives
babs
brought
cochrane
a
plate
he
put
food
in
his
mouth
and
chewed
and
swallowed
they
say
we
ca
afford
to
breathe
the
local
air
at
all
until
we
know
its
bacteriology
we
ca
touch
anything
until
we
test
it
as
a
possible
allergen
we
ca
holden
grunted
what
would
those
same
authorities
have
told
your
friend
columbus
on
a
strange
continent
he
be
sure
to
find
strange
plants
and
strange
animals
he
find
strange
races
of
men
and
he
ought
to
find
strange
diseases
they
have
warned
him
not
to
risk
it
would
cochrane
ate
with
a
sort
of
angry
vigor
then
he
snapped
if
you
want
to
know
we
got
to
land
we
sunk
if
we
do
go
outside
and
move
around
we
spoil
our
this
is
the
greatest
anybody
on
earth
ever
tuned
in
to
follow
if
we
back
down
on
exploration
our
audience
will
be
disgusted
and
resentful
and
they
take
it
out
on
our
sponsors
babs
said
softly
to
holden
that
my
boss
cochrane
glared
at
her
he
did
know
how
to
take
the
comment
he
said
to
holden
tomorrow
we
try
to
figure
out
some
sort
of
test
and
try
the
air
i
go
out
in
a
and
crack
the
i
can
close
it
again
before
anything
lethal
gets
in
but
there
no
use
stepping
out
into
a
bed
of
coals
tonight
i
have
to
wait
till
morning
holden
smiled
at
him
babs
regarded
him
with
intent
enigmatic
eyes
neither
of
them
said
anything
more
cochrane
finished
his
meal
then
he
found
himself
without
an
occupation
gravity
on
this
planet
was
very
nearly
the
same
as
on
earth
it
felt
like
more
of
course
because
all
of
them
had
been
subject
only
to
for
nearly
three
weeks
jones
and
the
pilot
had
been
in
gravity
for
a
much
longer
time
and
the
absence
of
gravity
had
caused
their
muscles
to
lose
tone
by
just
about
the
amount
that
the
same
time
spent
in
a
hospital
bed
would
have
done
they
felt
physically
worn
out
it
was
a
healthy
tiredness
though
and
their
muscles
would
come
back
to
normal
as
quickly
as
one
recovers
strength
after
illness
rather
faster
in
fact
but
tonight
there
would
be
no
on
the
johnny
simms
disappeared
after
symptoms
of
fretfulness
akin
to
those
of
an
small
boy
jamison
gave
up
and
bell
and
al
the
pilot
fell
asleep
while
jones
was
trying
to
discuss
something
technical
with
him
jones
himself
yawned
and
yawned
and
when
al
snored
in
his
face
he
gave
up
they
retired
to
their
bunks
there
was
no
point
in
standing
guard
over
the
ship
if
the
bed
of
hot
ashes
did
not
guard
it
it
was
not
likely
that
an
individual
merely
sitting
up
and
staring
out
its
ports
would
do
much
good
there
were
extremely
minor
practically
unnoticeable
vibrations
of
the
ship
from
time
to
time
they
would
be
volcanic
temblors
to
be
expected
they
were
not
alarming
certainly
and
the
forest
outside
was
guarantee
of
no
great
violence
to
be
anticipated
the
trees
stood
firm
and
tall
there
was
no
worry
about
the
ship
it
was
perfectly
practical
and
even
necessary
simply
to
turn
out
the
lights
and
go
to
sleep
but
cochrane
could
not
relax
he
was
annoyed
by
the
soreness
of
his
muscles
he
was
irritated
by
the
picture
given
him
of
the
expedition
as
a
group
of
heedless
ignoramuses
who
taken
off
without
or
bacteriological
equipment
without
even
apparatus
to
test
the
air
of
planets
they
might
land
on
and
who
now
were
sternly
warned
not
to
make
any
use
of
their
achievement
cochrane
was
not
overwhelmed
by
the
achievement
itself
though
less
than
eighteen
hours
since
the
ship
and
all
its
company
had
been
aground
on
luna
and
now
they
were
landed
on
a
new
world
twice
as
far
from
earth
as
the
pole
star
it
is
probable
that
cochrane
was
not
awed
because
he
had
a
point
of
view
he
regarded
this
entire
affair
as
a
production
he
was
absorbed
in
the
details
of
putting
it
across
he
looked
at
it
from
his
own
quite
narrow
professional
viewpoint
it
did
not
disturb
him
that
he
was
surrounded
by
a
wilderness
he
considered
the
wilderness
the
set
on
which
his
production
belonged
though
he
was
as
much
a
city
man
as
anybody
else
he
went
back
to
the
with
the
ship
standing
on
its
tail
that
was
the
highest
point
and
as
the
embers
burned
out
and
the
smoke
lessened
it
was
possible
to
look
out
into
the
night
he
stared
at
the
trees
beyond
the
burned
area
and
at
the
dark
masses
of
mountains
which
blotted
out
the
stars
he
estimated
them
without
quite
realizing
it
in
view
of
what
they
would
look
like
on
a
television
screen
when
light
objects
in
the
rattled
slightly
he
paid
no
attention
his
had
been
rickety
back
home
babs
seemed
to
be
sleepless
too
there
was
next
to
no
light
where
cochrane
was
merely
the
which
assured
that
the
dabney
field
still
existed
though
blocked
for
use
by
the
substance
of
a
planet
babs
arrived
in
the
room
only
minutes
after
cochrane
he
was
moving
restlessly
from
one
port
to
another
staring
out
i
thought
i
tell
you
babs
volunteered
that
doctor
holden
put
some
algae
from
the
tanks
in
the
airlock
and
then
opened
the
outer
door
why
asked
cochrane
algae
earth
explained
babs
if
the
air
is
poisonous
it
will
be
killed
by
morning
we
can
close
the
outer
door
of
the
lock
pump
out
the
air
that
came
from
this
planet
and
then
let
air
in
from
the
ship
so
we
can
see
what
happens
oh
said
cochrane
and
then
i
could
sleep
said
babs
guilelessly
do
you
mind
if
i
stay
here
everybody
else
has
gone
to
bed
oh
no
said
cochrane
stay
if
you
like
he
stared
out
at
the
dark
presently
he
moved
to
another
port
after
a
moment
he
pointed
there
a
glow
in
the
sky
there
he
said
curtly
she
looked
there
was
a
vast
curving
blackness
which
masked
the
stars
beyond
it
there
was
a
reddish
glare
as
if
of
some
monstrous
burning
but
the
color
was
not
right
for
a
fire
not
exactly
a
city
asked
babs
breathlessly
a
volcano
cochrane
told
her
i
staged
shows
that
pretended
to
show
intellectual
creatures
on
other
planets
funny
how
we
been
dreaming
of
such
things
back
on
earth
but
it
is
likely
not
since
we
actually
reached
the
stars
why
since
then
because
said
cochrane
half
ironically
man
was
given
dominion
over
all
created
things
i
do
think
we
find
rivals
for
that
dominion
i
ca
imagine
we
find
another
race
of
creatures
who
could
be
persons
heaven
knows
we
try
to
rob
each
other
of
dignity
but
i
do
think
there
another
race
to
humiliate
us
when
we
find
them
after
a
moment
he
added
bad
enough
that
we
here
because
there
are
deodorants
and
cosmetics
and
and
such
things
that
people
want
to
advertise
to
each
other
we
would
be
here
but
for
them
and
for
the
fact
that
some
people
are
neurotics
and
some
do
like
their
bosses
and
some
are
crazy
in
other
fashions
some
crazinesses
are
bad
argued
babs
i
made
a
living
out
of
them
agreed
cochrane
sourly
but
i
like
them
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
could
arrange
things
better
i
know
i
could
but
i
like
to
try
in
my
own
small
way
i
even
trying
babs
chuckled
that
because
you
are
a
man
women
are
so
foolish
we
realists
we
like
creation
even
men
the
way
creation
is
i
do
cochrane
said
irritably
we
accomplished
something
terrific
and
i
do
get
a
kick
out
of
it
my
head
is
full
of
business
details
that
have
to
be
attended
to
tomorrow
i
ought
to
be
uplifted
i
ought
to
be
gloating
i
ought
to
be
happy
but
i
worrying
for
fear
that
this
infernal
planet
is
going
to
disappoint
our
audience
babs
chuckled
again
then
she
went
to
the
stair
leading
to
the
compartment
below
what
the
matter
he
demanded
after
all
i
going
to
leave
you
alone
said
babs
cheerfully
always
very
careful
not
to
talk
to
me
in
any
personal
fashion
i
think
you
afraid
i
tell
you
something
for
your
own
good
if
i
stayed
here
i
might
goodnight
she
started
down
the
stairs
cochrane
said
vexedly
hold
on
confound
it
i
did
know
i
was
so
transparent
i
sorry
babs
look
tell
me
something
for
my
own
good
babs
hesitated
and
then
said
very
cheerfully
you
only
see
things
the
way
a
man
sees
them
this
show
this
trip
this
whole
business
does
thrill
you
because
you
do
see
it
the
way
a
woman
would
such
as
how
what
does
a
woman
see
that
i
do
a
woman
said
babs
sees
this
planet
as
a
place
that
men
and
women
will
come
to
live
on
to
live
on
you
do
you
miss
all
the
real
implications
of
people
actually
living
here
but
they
the
things
a
woman
sees
first
of
all
cochrane
frowned
i
not
so
conceited
i
ca
listen
to
somebody
else
if
you
got
an
idea
not
an
idea
said
babs
just
a
reaction
and
you
ca
explain
a
reaction
to
somebody
who
has
had
it
goodnight
she
vanished
down
the
stairs
some
time
later
cochrane
heard
the
extremely
minute
sound
of
a
door
closing
on
one
of
the
cabins
three
decks
down
in
the
he
went
back
to
his
restless
inspection
of
the
night
outside
he
tried
to
make
sense
of
what
babs
had
said
he
failed
altogether
in
the
end
he
settled
in
one
of
the
cushioned
chairs
that
had
made
this
ship
so
attractive
to
deluded
investors
he
intended
to
think
out
what
babs
might
have
meant
she
was
after
all
the
most
competent
secretary
he
ever
had
and
he
been
wryly
aware
of
how
helpless
he
would
be
without
her
now
he
tried
painstakingly
to
imagine
what
changes
in
one
view
the
inclusion
of
women
among
pioneers
would
involve
he
worked
out
some
seemingly
valid
points
but
it
was
not
a
congenial
mental
occupation
he
fell
asleep
without
realizing
it
and
was
waked
by
the
sound
of
voices
all
about
him
it
was
morning
again
and
johnny
simms
was
shouting
boyishly
at
something
he
saw
outside
get
at
it
boy
he
cried
enthusiastically
grab
him
that
the
way
cochrane
opened
his
eyes
johnny
simms
gazed
out
and
down
from
a
waving
his
arms
his
wife
alicia
looked
out
of
the
same
port
without
seeming
to
share
his
excited
approval
bell
had
dragged
a
camera
across
the
and
was
in
the
act
of
focussing
it
through
a
particular
window
what
the
matter
demanded
cochrane
he
struggled
out
of
his
chair
and
johnny
simms
pleasure
evaporated
abruptly
he
swore
nastily
viciously
at
something
outside
the
ship
his
wife
touched
his
arm
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
tone
he
turned
furiously
upon
her
mouthing
foulnesses
cochrane
was
formidably
beside
him
and
johnny
simms
expression
of
fury
smoothed
out
instantly
he
looked
pleasant
and
amiable
the
fight
stopped
he
explained
offhandedly
it
was
a
good
fight
but
one
of
the
creatures
would
stay
and
take
his
licking
alicia
said
steadily
there
were
some
animals
there
they
looked
rather
like
bears
only
they
had
enormous
ears
cochrane
looked
at
johnny
simms
with
hot
eyes
it
was
absurd
to
be
so
chivalrous
perhaps
but
he
was
enraged
after
an
instant
he
turned
away
and
went
to
the
port
the
area
was
now
only
ashes
at
its
edge
charcoal
showed
and
now
he
could
see
trees
and
brushwood
on
beyond
the
trees
did
not
seem
strange
because
no
trees
would
have
seemed
familiar
the
brush
did
not
impress
him
as
exotic
because
his
experience
with
actual
plants
was
restricted
to
the
artificial
plants
on
television
sets
and
the
artificially
arranged
plants
on
rooftops
he
hardly
let
his
eyes
dwell
on
the
vegetation
at
all
he
searched
for
movement
he
saw
the
moving
furry
rumps
of
half
a
dozen
unknown
creatures
as
they
dived
into
concealment
as
if
they
had
been
frightened
he
looked
down
and
could
see
the
hull
of
the
ship
and
two
of
the
three
fins
on
which
it
rested
the
airlock
door
was
opening
out
it
swung
wide
it
swung
back
against
the
hull
holden
making
some
sort
of
test
of
the
air
cochrane
said
shortly
the
animals
were
scared
when
the
outside
door
swung
open
i
see
what
he
finds
out
he
hurried
down
he
found
babs
standing
beside
the
inner
door
of
the
airlock
she
looked
somehow
pale
there
were
two
saucers
of
greenish
stuff
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
that
would
be
of
course
the
algae
from
the
tanks
the
algae
were
alive
said
babs
holden
went
in
the
lock
to
try
the
air
himself
he
said
he
be
very
careful
for
some
obscure
reason
cochrane
felt
ashamed
there
was
a
long
a
desperately
long
wait
then
sounds
of
machinery
the
outer
door
closing
small
whistlings
compressed
air
the
inner
door
opened
bill
holden
came
out
of
the
lock
his
expression
zestfully
surprised
hello
jed
i
tried
the
air
it
all
right
at
a
guess
maybe
a
little
high
in
oxygen
but
it
feels
wonderfully
good
to
breathe
and
i
can
report
that
the
trees
are
wood
and
the
green
is
chlorophyll
and
this
is
an
planet
that
little
smoky
smell
about
is
completely
familiar
and
i
taking
that
as
an
analysis
i
going
to
take
a
walk
cochrane
found
himself
watching
babs
face
she
looked
enormously
relieved
but
even
cochrane
who
was
looking
for
something
of
the
sort
without
realizing
it
could
not
read
anything
but
relief
in
her
expression
she
did
not
for
example
look
admiring
i
borrow
one
of
johnny
simms
guns
said
holden
and
take
a
look
around
it
either
perfectly
safe
or
we
all
dead
anyhow
frankly
i
think
it
safe
it
feels
right
outside
jed
it
honestly
feels
right
i
come
with
you
said
cochrane
jones
and
the
pilot
are
necessary
if
the
ship
to
get
back
to
earth
but
we
expendable
he
went
back
to
the
johnny
simms
zestfully
undertook
to
outfit
them
with
arms
he
made
no
proposal
to
accompany
them
in
twenty
minutes
or
so
cochrane
and
holden
went
into
the
airlock
and
the
door
closed
a
light
came
on
automatically
precisely
like
the
light
in
an
electric
refrigerator
cochrane
found
his
lips
twitching
a
little
as
the
analogy
came
to
him
seconds
later
the
outer
door
opened
and
they
gazed
down
among
the
branches
of
tall
trees
cochrane
winced
there
was
no
railing
and
the
height
bothered
him
but
holden
swung
out
the
sling
he
and
cochrane
descended
dangling
down
fifty
feet
of
unscarred
shining
metal
hull
the
ground
was
still
hot
underfoot
holden
cast
off
the
sling
and
moved
toward
cooler
territory
with
an
undignified
haste
cochrane
followed
him
the
smells
were
absolutely
commonplace
scorched
wood
smokiness
there
were
noises
occasional
cracklings
from
burned
not
wholly
consumed
shrill
musical
notes
and
in
and
among
the
smells
there
was
an
astonishing
freshness
in
the
feel
of
the
air
cochrane
was
especially
apt
to
notice
it
because
he
had
lived
in
a
city
back
on
earth
and
had
spent
four
days
in
the
and
then
had
breathed
the
lunar
city
air
for
eighteen
days
more
and
had
just
come
from
the
whose
air
was
distinctly
of
the
canned
variety
he
did
not
notice
the
noise
of
the
sling
again
in
motion
behind
him
he
was
all
eyes
and
ears
and
acute
awareness
of
the
completely
strange
environment
he
was
the
more
conscious
of
a
general
strangeness
because
he
was
so
completely
an
urban
product
yet
he
and
holden
were
vastly
less
aware
of
the
real
strangeness
about
them
than
men
of
previous
generations
would
have
been
they
did
not
notice
the
oddity
of
croaking
sounds
like
frogs
coming
from
the
when
they
had
threaded
their
way
among
leaning
charred
poles
and
came
to
green
stuff
underfoot
and
merely
toasted
foliage
all
around
cochrane
heard
a
sweet
trilling
which
came
from
a
hole
in
the
ground
but
he
was
not
astonished
by
the
place
from
which
the
trilling
came
he
was
astonished
at
the
sound
itself
there
was
a
cry
behind
them
cochrane
doctor
holden
they
swung
about
and
there
was
babs
on
the
ground
just
disentangling
herself
from
the
sling
she
had
followed
them
out
after
waiting
until
they
had
left
the
airlock
and
could
not
protest
cochrane
swore
to
himself
but
when
babs
joined
them
breathlessly
after
a
hopping
run
over
the
hot
ground
he
said
only
fancy
meeting
you
here
i
could
resist
said
babs
in
breathless
apology
and
you
do
have
guns
it
safe
enough
oh
look
she
stared
at
a
bush
which
was
covered
with
pale
purple
flowers
small
creatures
hovered
in
the
air
about
it
she
approached
it
and
exclaimed
again
at
the
sweetness
of
its
scent
cochrane
and
holden
joined
her
in
admiration
in
a
sense
they
were
foolishly
unwary
this
was
completely
strange
territory
it
could
have
contained
anything
earlier
explorers
would
have
approached
every
bush
with
caution
and
moved
over
every
hilltop
with
suspicion
anticipating
deadly
creatures
unparalleled
monsters
and
exotic
and
peculiar
circumstances
designed
to
entrap
the
unprepared
earlier
explorers
of
course
would
probably
have
had
advice
from
famous
men
to
prepare
them
for
all
possible
danger
but
this
was
a
valley
between
mountains
the
river
that
ran
down
its
length
was
fed
by
glaciers
this
was
a
temperate
climate
the
trees
were
either
coniferous
or
something
similar
and
the
vegetation
grew
well
but
not
with
the
frenzy
of
a
tropic
region
there
were
fruits
here
and
there
later
to
be
sure
they
would
prove
to
be
mostly
astringent
and
unpalatable
they
were
plants
which
would
eventually
turn
out
to
be
possessed
of
roots
which
were
almost
unanimously
useless
for
human
purposes
there
were
even
some
plants
with
thorns
and
spines
upon
them
but
they
encountered
no
danger
by
and
large
wild
animals
everywhere
are
ferocious
only
when
desperate
no
natural
setting
can
permanently
be
so
deadly
that
human
being
will
be
attacked
immediately
they
appear
an
area
in
which
peril
is
continuous
is
one
in
which
there
is
so
much
killing
that
there
is
no
left
to
maintain
its
predators
on
the
whole
there
is
simply
a
limit
to
how
dangerous
any
place
can
be
dangerous
beasts
have
to
be
relatively
rare
or
they
will
not
have
enough
to
eat
when
they
will
thin
out
until
they
are
relatively
rare
and
do
have
enough
to
eat
so
the
three
explorers
moved
safely
though
their
boldness
was
that
of
ignorance
below
gigantic
trees
nearly
as
tall
as
the
standing
on
end
they
saw
a
small
furry
biped
some
twelve
inches
tall
which
waddled
insanely
in
the
exact
line
of
their
progress
and
with
no
apparent
hope
of
outdistancing
them
they
saw
a
gauzy
creature
with
incredibly
spindly
legs
it
flew
from
one
to
another
clinging
to
rough
bark
on
each
in
turn
once
they
came
upon
a
small
animal
which
looked
at
them
with
enormous
blue
eyes
and
then
fled
with
a
sinuous
gait
on
legs
so
short
that
they
seemed
mere
flippers
it
dived
into
a
hole
and
vanished
but
they
came
out
to
clear
space
they
could
look
for
miles
and
miles
there
was
a
savannah
of
rolling
soil
which
gradually
sloped
down
to
a
river
the
grass
if
it
was
grass
was
quite
green
but
it
had
multitudes
of
tiny
flowers
down
the
central
rib
of
each
leaf
nearby
it
seemed
the
color
of
but
it
faded
imperceptibly
into
an
incredible
tint
in
the
distance
the
on
either
side
of
the
valley
were
sheer
and
tall
there
was
a
great
stony
spur
reaching
out
above
the
lowland
and
there
was
forest
at
its
top
and
bare
brown
stone
dropping
two
thousand
feet
sheer
and
up
the
valley
where
it
narrowed
a
waterfall
leaped
out
from
the
cliff
and
dropped
hundreds
of
feet
in
an
arc
of
purest
white
until
it
was
lost
to
view
behind
they
looked
they
stared
cochrane
was
a
television
producer
and
holden
was
a
psychiatrist
and
babs
was
a
highly
efficient
secretary
they
did
not
make
scientific
observations
the
ecological
system
of
the
valley
escaped
their
notice
they
were
qualified
to
observe
that
the
flying
things
around
seemed
mostly
to
be
furry
instead
of
feathered
and
that
insects
seemed
few
and
huge
and
fragile
and
they
did
not
notice
that
most
of
the
plants
appeared
to
be
deciduous
so
indicating
that
this
planet
had
pronounced
seasons
but
holden
said
up
in
greenland
there
a
hospital
on
a
cliff
like
that
people
with
delusions
of
grandeur
sometimes
get
cured
just
by
looking
at
something
that
so
much
greater
and
more
splendid
than
they
are
i
like
to
see
a
hospital
up
yonder
babs
said
a
city
could
be
built
in
this
valley
not
a
tall
city
with
gray
streets
and
gardens
on
the
roofs
this
could
be
a
nice
little
city
like
people
used
to
have
there
would
be
little
houses
all
separate
and
there
be
grass
all
around
and
people
could
pluck
flowers
if
they
wanted
to
to
take
inside
there
could
be
families
here
and
homes
not
cochrane
said
nothing
he
was
envious
of
the
others
they
saw
and
they
dreamed
according
to
their
natures
cochrane
somehow
felt
forlorn
presently
he
said
depressedly
we
go
back
to
the
ship
you
can
work
out
your
woman
viewpoint
stuff
with
bell
babs
he
write
it
or
you
can
give
it
to
alicia
to
put
over
when
we
go
on
the
air
babs
made
no
reply
the
absence
of
comment
was
almost
pointed
cochrane
realized
that
she
would
do
it
though
he
could
see
why
they
did
go
back
to
the
ship
cochrane
sent
babs
and
holden
up
the
sling
first
while
he
waited
down
below
it
was
a
singular
sensation
to
stand
there
he
was
the
only
human
being
afoot
on
a
planet
the
size
of
earth
or
larger
at
the
foot
of
a
cliff
of
metal
which
was
the
hull
he
had
a
weapon
in
his
hand
and
it
should
defend
him
from
anything
but
he
felt
very
lonely
the
sling
came
down
for
him
he
felt
sick
at
heart
as
it
lifted
him
he
had
an
overwhelming
conviction
of
incompetence
though
he
could
not
detail
the
reasons
the
rope
hauled
him
up
swaying
to
the
dizzy
height
of
the
door
he
could
not
feel
elated
he
was
partly
responsible
for
humankind
greatest
achievement
to
date
but
he
had
not
quite
the
viewpoint
that
would
let
him
enjoy
its
contemplation
the
ground
quivered
very
faintly
as
he
rose
it
was
not
an
earthquake
it
was
merely
a
temblor
such
as
anyone
would
expect
to
feel
occasionally
with
six
smoking
volcanic
cones
in
view
the
green
stuff
all
around
was
proof
that
it
could
be
disregarded
chapter
seven
in
the
united
states
some
away
it
happened
to
be
tuesday
on
this
tuesday
the
broadcast
from
the
stars
was
sponsored
by
harvey
the
national
men
clothing
chain
advertising
department
preferred
shows
because
differences
of
opinion
in
the
shows
proper
led
so
neatly
into
their
you
can
disagree
about
anything
but
the
quality
of
a
harvey
suit
that
superb
therefore
the
broadcast
after
the
landing
of
the
ship
on
the
volcanic
planet
was
partly
commercial
and
partly
pictures
and
reports
from
the
spaceways
expedition
and
partly
queries
and
comments
by
individuals
on
earth
inevitably
there
was
dabney
and
dabney
was
neurotic
he
did
his
best
to
make
a
shambles
of
everything
the
show
started
promptly
enough
at
the
beginning
there
was
a
of
puppets
marching
row
on
row
indicating
the
enormous
popularity
of
harvey
suits
then
a
fast
minute
about
two
feuding
mountaineers
who
found
they
could
possibly
retain
their
enmity
when
they
found
themselves
in
agreement
on
the
quality
of
harvey
suits
that
superb
the
commercial
ended
with
a
choral
dance
of
madly
enthusiastic
miniature
figures
dancing
while
they
lustily
sang
the
you
can
disagree
yes
siree
you
can
disagree
about
anything
indeed
everything
you
and
me
but
you
ca
no
you
ca
disagree
about
the
strictly
super
extra
super
qualitee
of
a
suit
superb
and
thereupon
the
television
audience
of
several
continents
saw
the
image
of
mankind
first
starship
poised
upon
its
among
trees
more
splendid
than
even
television
shows
had
ever
pictured
before
the
camera
panned
slowly
and
showed
such
open
spaces
as
very
few
humans
had
ever
seen
unencumbered
by
buildings
and
mountains
of
a
grandeur
difficult
for
most
people
to
believe
in
the
scene
cut
to
the
and
al
the
pilot
acted
briskly
as
the
leader
of
an
just
returned
though
he
actually
had
left
the
ship
he
introduced
jamison
wearing
improvised
leggings
and
other
trappings
appropriate
to
an
explorer
in
wilderness
jamison
began
to
extrapolate
from
his
observations
out
the
port
adding
for
authority
smoothly
and
hypnotically
he
pictured
the
valley
as
the
ship
descended
the
last
few
thousand
feet
and
told
of
the
human
colony
to
be
founded
in
this
vast
and
hospitable
area
just
explored
mountainside
hotels
for
would
look
down
upon
a
scene
of
tranquility
and
cozy
spaciousness
this
would
be
the
first
human
outpost
in
the
stars
in
the
other
valleys
of
this
magnificent
world
there
would
be
and
humankind
would
again
begin
to
regard
meat
as
a
normal
and
part
of
its
diet
on
this
planet
certainly
there
were
minerals
beyond
doubt
and
the
estimate
was
that
at
least
the
equivalent
of
the
asian
continent
had
been
made
available
for
human
occupation
and
this
splendid
addition
to
the
resources
of
humanity
the
second
commercial
cut
jamison
off
naturally
the
sponsor
was
paying
for
time
so
for
jamison
was
substituted
the
other
fiction
about
the
poor
young
man
who
found
himself
envied
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
firm
which
employed
him
his
impeccable
attire
caused
him
to
be
promoted
to
without
any
question
of
whether
or
not
he
could
fill
the
job
because
of
course
he
wore
a
harvey
suit
alicia
keith
showed
herself
on
the
screen
and
gave
the
woman
viewpoint
as
written
about
by
bell
she
talked
pleasantly
about
how
it
felt
to
move
about
on
a
planet
never
before
trodden
by
human
beings
she
was
interrupted
by
the
pictured
face
of
the
lady
editor
of
joint
feminine
programs
who
asked
sweetly
tell
me
alicia
what
do
you
think
the
attainment
of
the
stars
will
mean
to
the
average
american
housewife
in
the
immediate
future
right
now
then
dabney
came
on
his
appearance
was
fitted
into
the
sequence
from
lunar
city
and
his
gestures
were
extravagant
as
anybody
gestures
will
be
where
their
hands
and
arms
weigh
so
small
a
fraction
of
i
wish
said
dabney
impressively
to
congratulate
the
men
who
have
so
swiftly
adapted
my
discovery
of
travel
to
practical
use
i
am
overwhelmed
at
having
been
able
to
achieve
a
scientific
triumph
which
in
time
will
mean
that
mankind
future
stretches
endlessly
and
splendidly
into
the
future
here
there
was
canned
applause
dabney
held
up
his
hand
for
attention
he
thought
visibly
but
he
said
urgently
i
admit
that
i
am
disturbed
by
the
precipitancy
of
the
action
that
has
been
taken
i
feel
as
if
i
were
like
some
powerful
djinni
giving
gifts
which
the
recipients
may
use
without
thought
more
canned
applause
inserted
because
he
had
given
instructions
for
it
whenever
he
paused
the
at
luna
city
took
pleasure
in
following
instructions
exactly
dabney
held
up
his
hand
again
again
he
performed
feats
of
meditation
in
plain
view
at
the
moment
he
said
anxiously
as
the
author
of
this
truly
magnificent
achievement
i
have
to
use
the
same
intellect
which
produced
it
to
examine
the
possibility
of
its
use
may
not
explorers
who
took
off
without
my
having
examined
their
plans
and
precautions
may
not
users
of
my
gift
to
humanity
do
harm
may
they
not
find
bacteria
the
human
body
can
not
resist
may
they
not
bring
back
plagues
and
epidemics
have
they
prepared
themselves
to
use
my
discovery
only
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
or
have
they
been
precipitous
i
shall
have
to
apply
myself
to
the
devising
of
methods
by
which
my
discovery
made
so
that
humanity
might
attain
hitherto
i
shall
have
to
devise
means
by
which
it
will
be
truly
a
blessing
to
mankind
dabney
of
course
had
tasted
the
limelight
all
the
world
considered
him
the
greatest
scientist
of
all
time
except
of
course
the
people
who
knew
something
about
science
but
the
first
actual
voyagers
in
space
had
become
immediately
greater
heroes
than
himself
it
was
intolerable
to
dabney
to
be
restricted
to
taking
bows
on
programs
in
which
they
starred
so
he
wrote
a
star
part
for
himself
the
bearded
biologist
who
followed
him
was
to
have
lectured
on
the
pictures
and
reports
forwarded
to
him
beforehand
but
he
could
not
ignore
so
promising
a
lead
to
show
how
much
he
knew
so
he
lectured
authoritatively
on
the
danger
of
organisms
being
introduced
on
earth
he
painted
a
lurid
picture
quoting
from
the
history
of
epidemics
he
wound
up
with
a
specific
prophecy
of
something
like
the
black
death
of
the
middle
ages
as
lurking
among
the
stars
to
decimate
humanity
he
was
a
victim
of
the
which
affects
some
people
on
television
when
they
think
millions
of
other
people
are
listening
to
them
they
depart
madly
from
their
scripts
to
try
to
say
something
startling
enough
to
justify
all
the
attention
they
getting
the
broadcast
ended
with
a
sentimental
live
commercial
in
which
a
dazzlingly
beautiful
girl
melted
into
the
arms
of
the
worthy
young
man
she
had
previously
scorned
she
found
him
irresistible
when
she
noticed
that
he
was
wearing
a
suit
she
instantly
knew
by
its
quality
could
only
come
from
harvey
on
the
planet
of
glaciers
and
volcanoes
holden
fumed
dammit
he
protested
they
talk
like
we
lepers
like
if
we
ever
come
back
we
be
carriers
of
some
monstrous
disease
that
will
wipe
out
the
human
race
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
no
more
likely
to
catch
an
disease
than
to
catch
from
sick
chickens
that
broadcast
nothing
to
worry
about
said
cochrane
but
it
is
insisted
holden
dabney
and
that
fool
biologist
presented
as
a
reason
for
panic
they
could
have
every
human
being
on
earth
scared
to
death
we
bring
back
germs
and
everybody
die
of
the
croup
cochrane
grinned
good
publicity
if
we
needed
it
actually
they
boosted
the
show
from
now
on
every
presentation
has
a
dramatic
kick
it
did
have
before
now
everybody
will
feel
suspense
waiting
for
the
next
show
has
jamison
got
the
purple
death
on
the
planet
of
smoky
hilltops
will
darling
alicia
keith
break
out
in
green
spots
next
time
we
watch
her
on
the
air
has
captain
al
of
the
breathed
in
spores
of
the
swelling
fungus
are
the
doomed
tune
in
on
our
next
broadcast
and
see
my
dear
bill
if
we
were
signed
up
for
sponsors
fees
i
raise
our
prices
after
this
trick
holden
looked
unconvinced
cochrane
said
kindly
do
worry
i
could
turn
off
the
panic
tomorrow
as
much
panic
as
there
is
kursten
kasten
hopkins
and
fallowe
had
a
proposal
they
set
great
store
by
they
wanted
to
parcel
out
a
big
contest
for
a
name
for
mankind
second
planet
they
had
regional
sponsors
lined
up
it
would
have
been
worldwide
advertisers
were
drooling
over
the
prospect
of
people
proposing
names
for
this
planet
on
they
were
planning
five
million
and
who
be
afraid
of
us
then
but
i
turned
it
down
because
we
have
got
a
helicopter
we
could
stage
enough
different
shows
from
this
planet
to
keep
it
going
the
minimum
six
weeks
for
a
contest
like
that
instead
we
taking
off
in
a
couple
of
hours
jones
agrees
the
astronomers
back
home
have
picked
out
another
star
that
ought
to
have
planets
we
going
to
run
over
and
see
what
pickings
we
can
find
not
too
far
only
he
regarded
holden
quizzically
to
see
how
the
last
phases
affected
him
holden
did
notice
it
a
contest
it
does
make
sense
i
know
it
is
sense
said
cochrane
it
beginning
to
get
my
back
i
see
now
that
a
job
is
only
as
good
as
its
man
he
went
zestfully
to
find
babs
to
tell
her
to
leave
the
and
let
queries
go
unanswered
as
a
matter
of
simple
business
policy
the
sling
which
swung
out
of
the
airlock
now
became
busy
they
had
landed
on
this
planet
and
they
were
going
to
leave
it
and
there
had
been
a
minimum
of
actual
contact
with
its
soil
so
jamison
took
his
leggings
put
on
for
the
show
and
he
and
bell
went
down
to
the
ground
and
foraged
through
the
woods
jamison
carried
one
of
johnny
guns
which
he
regarded
with
acute
suspicion
and
bell
carried
cameras
they
photographed
trees
and
underbrush
first
as
atmosphere
and
then
with
fanatic
attention
to
leaves
and
fruits
or
flowers
bell
got
pictures
of
one
of
the
small
furry
bipeds
that
cochrane
and
holden
had
spied
when
babs
was
with
them
he
got
a
picture
of
what
he
believed
to
be
a
it
was
thicker
and
heavier
and
huger
than
any
web
on
earth
and
rather
fearfully
looked
for
the
monster
that
could
string
cables
as
thick
as
then
he
found
that
it
was
not
a
snare
at
all
it
was
a
construction
at
whose
center
something
undiscoverable
had
made
a
nest
with
eggs
in
it
some
creature
had
made
an
unapproachable
home
for
itself
where
its
young
would
not
be
assailed
by
predators
al
the
pilot
went
out
of
the
lock
and
descended
to
the
ground
and
went
as
far
as
the
edge
of
the
but
he
did
not
go
any
farther
he
wandered
about
unhappily
pretending
that
he
did
not
want
to
go
into
the
woods
he
tried
to
appear
quite
content
to
view
trees
for
his
experience
of
the
first
planet
on
which
men
had
landed
he
did
kick
up
some
pebbles
and
one
of
them
had
flecks
of
what
looked
like
gold
in
it
al
regarded
it
excitedly
and
then
thought
of
but
he
did
scrabble
for
more
presently
he
had
a
of
small
stones
which
would
be
regarded
with
rapture
by
his
nieces
and
nephews
because
they
had
come
from
the
stars
actually
they
were
quite
commonplace
minerals
the
flecks
of
what
looked
like
gold
were
only
iron
pyrates
jones
did
not
leave
the
ship
he
was
puttering
nor
alicia
holden
urged
her
to
take
a
walk
and
she
said
quietly
johnny
out
with
a
gun
he
hunting
i
do
like
to
be
with
johnny
when
he
may
be
disappointed
she
smiled
and
holden
sourly
went
away
there
had
been
no
particular
consequences
of
johnny
simms
inability
to
remember
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
but
holden
felt
like
a
normal
man
about
men
whose
wives
look
patient
even
psychiatrists
feel
that
it
is
somehow
disreputable
to
illtreat
a
woman
who
does
fight
back
this
attitude
is
instinctive
it
is
what
is
called
the
fine
impulse
to
chivalry
which
is
one
of
the
prides
of
modern
culture
holden
settled
dourly
down
at
the
communicator
to
get
an
outgoing
call
to
earth
when
there
were
some
hundreds
of
incoming
calls
backed
up
by
sheer
obstinacy
and
bad
manners
he
made
it
he
got
a
connection
to
a
hospital
where
he
was
known
and
he
talked
to
its
bacteriologist
the
bacteriologist
was
competent
but
not
yet
famous
with
holden
giving
honest
guesses
at
the
color
of
the
sunlight
and
its
probable
content
and
with
careful
estimates
of
the
exactness
with
which
burning
vegetation
here
smelled
like
they
arrived
at
imprecise
but
common
sense
conclusions
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
possible
organic
compounds
only
so
many
actually
took
part
in
the
of
creatures
on
earth
yet
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
species
prepared
to
make
use
of
anything
usable
if
the
sunlight
and
temperature
of
the
two
worlds
were
similar
it
was
somewhat
more
than
likely
that
the
same
chemical
compounds
would
be
used
by
living
things
on
both
so
that
there
could
be
on
the
new
planet
which
could
be
harmful
but
on
the
other
hand
either
they
would
be
familiar
in
the
toxins
they
produced
and
human
bodies
could
resist
them
or
else
they
would
be
new
compounds
to
which
humans
would
react
allergically
basically
then
if
anybody
on
the
ship
developed
hives
they
had
reason
to
be
frightened
but
so
long
as
nobody
sneezed
or
broke
out
in
welts
their
lives
were
probably
safe
this
comforting
conclusion
took
a
long
time
to
work
out
meanwhile
babs
and
cochrane
had
swung
down
to
the
ground
and
went
hiking
cochrane
was
armed
as
before
though
he
had
no
experience
as
a
marksman
in
television
shows
he
had
directed
the
firing
of
weapons
shooting
blank
charges
cut
to
a
minimum
so
they
would
blast
the
mikes
he
knew
what
motions
to
go
through
but
nothing
else
they
did
not
explore
in
the
same
direction
as
their
first
excursion
the
ship
was
to
take
off
presently
as
soon
as
this
planet
had
turned
enough
for
the
nose
to
point
nearly
in
the
direction
of
their
next
target
they
had
two
hours
for
exploration
they
came
upon
something
which
lay
still
across
their
path
like
a
great
serpent
cochrane
looked
at
it
startledly
then
he
saw
that
the
round
glistening
seeming
snake
was
fastened
to
the
ground
by
rootlets
it
was
a
plant
which
grew
like
a
creeper
absorbing
nourishment
from
a
vast
somewhere
no
doubt
it
would
rear
upward
and
spread
out
leaves
to
absorb
the
sun
light
it
used
in
a
way
the
principle
of
those
lateral
wells
which
in
dry
climates
gather
water
too
scarce
to
collect
in
merely
vertical
holes
they
went
on
and
on
admiring
and
amazed
all
about
them
were
curiosities
of
adaptation
freaks
of
ecological
adjustment
marvels
of
symbiotic
cooperation
a
botanist
would
have
swooned
with
joy
at
the
material
all
about
a
biologist
would
have
babbled
happily
babs
and
cochrane
admired
without
information
they
walked
interestedly
but
unawed
among
the
unparalleled
back
on
earth
they
knew
as
much
as
most
people
about
nature
practically
nothing
at
all
babs
had
never
seen
any
wild
plants
before
she
was
fascinated
by
what
she
saw
and
exclaimed
at
everything
but
she
did
not
realize
a
fraction
of
the
marvels
on
which
her
eyes
rested
on
the
whole
she
survived
it
a
pity
we
have
got
a
helicopter
cochrane
said
regretfully
if
we
could
fly
around
from
place
to
place
and
send
back
pictures
we
ca
do
it
in
the
ship
it
would
burn
more
fuel
than
we
got
babs
wrinkled
her
forehead
doctor
holden
badly
worried
because
we
ca
make
as
alluring
a
picture
as
he
like
cochrane
halted
to
watch
something
which
was
flat
like
a
disk
of
flesh
and
which
moved
slowly
out
of
their
path
with
disquieting
writhing
motions
it
vanished
and
he
said
yes
bill
an
honest
man
even
if
he
is
a
psychiatrist
he
wants
desperately
to
do
something
for
the
poor
devils
back
home
who
so
pitifully
frustrated
there
are
tens
of
millions
of
men
who
ca
hope
for
anything
better
than
to
keep
the
food
and
shelter
supply
intact
for
themselves
and
their
families
they
ca
even
pretend
to
hope
for
more
than
that
there
is
more
than
so
much
to
go
around
but
bill
wants
to
give
them
hope
he
figures
that
without
hope
the
world
will
turn
madhouse
in
another
generation
it
will
you
trying
to
do
something
about
that
said
babs
quickly
you
think
you
offering
hope
to
everybody
back
on
earth
no
snapped
cochrane
i
not
trying
anything
so
abstract
as
furnishing
hope
to
a
frustrated
humanity
nobody
can
supply
an
abstraction
nobody
can
accomplish
an
abstraction
everything
actually
done
is
specific
and
real
maybe
you
can
find
abstract
qualities
in
it
after
it
done
but
i
a
practical
man
i
not
trying
to
produce
an
improved
psychological
climate
suitable
for
debilitated
psychos
i
trying
to
get
a
job
done
i
wondered
admitted
babs
what
the
job
is
cochrane
grimaced
you
would
believe
it
babs
there
was
an
odd
quivering
underfoot
trees
shook
there
was
no
other
peculiarity
anywhere
nothing
fell
no
rocks
rolled
in
a
valley
among
volcanoes
where
the
smoke
from
no
less
than
six
cones
could
be
seen
at
once
temblors
would
not
do
damage
what
damage
mild
shakings
could
do
would
have
been
done
centuries
since
babs
said
uneasily
that
feels
queer
does
it
cochrane
nodded
but
just
as
he
and
babs
had
never
been
conditioned
to
be
afraid
of
animals
they
had
been
conditioned
by
at
home
and
to
here
against
alarm
at
movements
of
their
surroundings
temblors
were
evidently
frequent
at
this
place
trees
were
anchored
against
them
as
against
prevailing
winds
in
exposed
situations
landslides
did
not
remain
poised
to
fall
really
unstable
slopes
had
been
shaken
down
long
ago
i
wish
we
had
a
helicopter
cochrane
repeated
the
look
of
the
mountains
as
we
came
down
with
glaciers
between
the
smoking
cones
that
was
good
we
could
have
held
interest
here
until
we
worked
that
naming
contest
we
could
use
the
extra
capital
that
would
bring
in
as
it
is
we
got
to
move
on
with
practically
nothing
accomplished
the
trouble
is
that
i
did
think
we
would
succeed
as
we
have
heaven
knows
i
could
have
gotten
helicopters
he
helped
her
up
a
small
steep
incline
where
rock
protruded
from
a
hillside
the
ground
trembled
again
not
alarmingly
but
babs
hold
of
his
hand
tightened
a
little
they
continued
to
climb
they
came
out
atop
a
small
bare
prominence
which
rose
above
the
forest
here
they
could
see
over
the
treetops
in
a
truly
extensive
view
the
mountains
all
about
were
clearly
visible
some
were
ten
and
some
twenty
miles
away
some
still
farther
were
barely
visible
in
the
thin
haze
of
distance
but
there
was
a
thick
pall
of
smoke
hovering
about
one
of
the
farthest
it
was
at
one
time
in
human
history
it
would
have
seemed
typically
a
volcanic
cloud
to
cochrane
and
babs
it
was
typically
the
cloud
of
an
atomic
explosion
the
ground
shook
sharply
underfoot
babs
staggered
flying
things
rose
from
the
forests
in
swarms
they
hovered
and
darted
and
flapped
above
the
temblors
did
not
alarm
the
creatures
of
the
valley
but
like
this
last
were
another
matter
a
great
tree
rearing
above
its
fellows
toppled
slowly
with
ripping
tearing
noises
it
bent
sedately
toward
the
smoking
mountain
it
crashed
thunderously
down
upon
smaller
trees
there
were
other
rending
noises
the
flying
things
rose
higher
seeming
agitated
echoes
sounded
in
the
ears
of
the
two
atop
the
hill
there
was
another
sharp
shock
babs
gave
a
little
inarticulate
cry
she
pointed
there
was
much
smoke
in
the
distance
over
the
cone
which
was
indistinct
in
the
smoke
of
its
own
making
over
the
edge
of
the
distant
mountains
a
glare
appeared
it
was
a
thin
line
of
bright
white
light
with
infinite
deliberation
it
began
to
creep
down
the
slanting
blessedly
remote
mountainside
the
ground
seemed
to
shift
abruptly
and
then
shift
back
across
and
down
the
valley
five
miles
away
a
portion
of
the
stony
wall
detached
itself
and
slid
downward
in
seeming
slow
motion
two
more
great
trees
made
ripping
sounds
one
crashed
there
was
an
enormous
darkness
above
one
part
of
the
sky
its
under
side
glowed
from
fires
as
of
hell
in
the
crater
beneath
it
there
were
sparkings
above
the
mountaintop
very
oddly
indeed
the
sky
overhead
was
peacefully
blue
but
at
the
horizon
a
sheet
of
fire
rolled
down
slopes
it
seemed
to
move
with
infinite
deliberation
but
to
move
visibly
at
such
a
distance
it
must
have
been
traveling
like
an
it
must
have
been
unthinkably
hot
molten
stone
thin
as
water
pouring
downward
in
a
flood
of
fire
there
was
no
longer
a
sensation
of
the
ground
trembling
underfoot
now
the
noticeable
sensation
was
when
the
ground
was
still
temblors
were
practically
continuous
there
were
distinct
sharp
impacts
as
of
violent
blows
nearby
babs
stared
fascinated
she
glanced
up
at
cochrane
his
skin
was
white
there
were
beads
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
we
safe
here
are
we
she
asked
scared
i
think
so
but
i
not
going
to
take
you
through
falling
trees
while
this
is
going
on
there
another
tree
down
i
worrying
about
the
ship
if
it
topples
she
looked
at
the
nose
of
the
gleaming
silver
metal
rising
from
the
trees
about
the
it
had
burned
clear
a
third
of
its
length
was
visible
if
it
topples
said
cochrane
we
never
be
able
to
take
off
it
has
to
point
up
to
lift
babs
looked
from
the
ship
to
him
and
back
again
then
her
eyes
went
fearfully
to
the
remote
mountain
rumblings
came
from
it
now
they
were
not
loud
they
were
hardly
more
than
dull
growlings
at
the
lower
limit
of
audible
pitch
they
were
like
faint
and
distant
thunder
there
were
flashings
like
lightning
in
the
cloud
which
now
enveloped
the
top
cochrane
made
an
indescribable
small
sound
he
stared
at
the
ship
as
passed
over
the
ground
a
faint
unanimous
movement
of
the
treetops
became
visible
it
seemed
to
cochrane
that
the
wavered
as
if
about
to
fall
from
its
upright
position
it
was
not
designed
to
stand
such
violence
as
a
fall
would
imply
its
hull
would
be
dented
or
rent
it
was
at
least
possible
that
its
would
detonate
but
even
if
its
fall
were
checked
by
trees
about
it
it
could
never
take
off
again
the
eight
humans
of
its
company
could
never
juggle
it
back
to
a
vertical
position
would
merely
push
it
in
the
direction
its
nose
pointed
toppled
its
would
merely
shove
it
blindly
over
stones
and
trees
and
to
destruction
the
ship
swayed
again
visibly
made
its
weight
have
the
effect
of
blows
part
of
its
foundation
rested
on
stone
only
feet
below
the
but
one
of
the
rested
on
humus
as
the
shocks
passed
that
sank
into
the
soft
soil
the
leaned
perceptibly
flying
creatures
darted
back
and
forth
above
the
miles
away
insensate
violence
reigned
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
shot
miles
into
the
air
and
half
a
mountainside
glowed
and
there
was
the
sound
of
thunder
and
the
ground
shook
and
quivered
there
were
movements
nearby
a
creature
with
yellow
fur
and
the
shape
of
a
bear
with
huge
ears
came
padding
out
of
the
forest
it
swarmed
up
the
bare
stone
of
the
hill
on
which
babs
and
cochrane
stood
it
ignored
them
halfway
up
the
unwooded
part
of
the
hill
it
stopped
and
made
plaintive
noises
other
creatures
came
many
had
come
while
the
man
and
girl
were
too
absorbed
to
notice
now
two
more
of
the
large
animals
came
out
into
the
open
and
climbed
the
hill
babs
said
shakily
do
you
think
they
do
you
think
there
was
a
nearer
roaring
the
leaned
and
leaned
cochrane
lips
tensed
the
rockets
bellowed
and
a
storm
of
hurtling
smoke
flashed
up
around
it
it
lifted
staggering
as
its
tried
frantically
to
swing
its
lower
parts
underneath
its
mass
it
lurched
violently
and
the
rockets
flamed
terribly
it
lifted
again
its
tail
was
higher
than
the
trees
but
it
did
not
point
straight
up
it
surged
horribly
across
the
top
of
the
forest
leaving
a
vast
flash
of
flaming
vegetation
behind
it
then
it
steadied
and
aimed
skyward
and
climbed
then
it
was
not
obviously
the
dabney
field
booster
had
been
flashed
on
to
get
the
ship
out
to
space
the
ship
had
vanished
into
emptiness
the
dabney
field
had
flicked
it
some
hundred
and
from
earth
moon
in
the
flicker
of
a
it
might
have
gone
that
far
again
whoever
was
in
it
had
had
no
choice
but
to
take
off
and
no
way
to
take
off
without
suicidal
use
of
fuel
in
any
other
way
cochrane
looked
at
where
the
ship
had
vanished
seconds
passed
there
came
the
thunderclap
of
air
closing
the
vacuum
the
ship
disappearance
had
left
there
were
squealings
behind
the
pair
on
the
hilltop
eight
of
the
huge
yellow
beasts
were
out
in
the
open
now
tiny
furry
biped
animals
waddled
desperately
to
get
out
of
their
way
smaller
creatures
scuttled
here
and
there
a
sinuous
creature
with
fur
but
no
apparent
legs
writhed
its
way
upward
but
all
the
creatures
were
frightened
they
observed
an
absolute
truce
under
the
overmastering
greater
fear
of
nature
far
away
the
volcano
on
the
skyline
boomed
and
flashed
and
emitted
monstrous
clouds
of
smoke
the
shining
incandescent
lava
on
its
flanks
glared
across
the
glaciers
babs
gasped
suddenly
she
realized
the
situation
in
which
she
and
cochrane
had
been
left
shivering
she
pressed
close
to
him
as
the
distant
black
spread
toward
the
center
of
the
sky
chapter
eight
before
sunset
they
reached
the
area
of
ashes
where
the
ship
had
stood
cochrane
was
sure
that
if
anybody
else
had
been
left
behind
besides
themselves
the
was
an
inevitable
rendezvous
only
three
members
of
the
ship
company
had
been
inside
when
babs
and
cochrane
left
to
stroll
for
the
two
hours
astronomers
on
earth
had
set
as
a
jones
had
been
in
the
ship
and
holden
and
alicia
simms
everybody
else
had
been
exploring
their
attitude
had
been
exactly
that
of
and
tourists
but
they
could
have
gotten
back
before
the
apparently
they
had
nobody
seemed
to
have
returned
to
the
space
since
the
ship
departure
the
blast
of
the
rockets
had
erased
all
previous
tracks
but
still
there
was
a
thin
layer
of
ash
resettled
over
the
clearing
footprints
would
have
been
visible
in
it
anybody
remaining
would
have
come
here
nobody
had
babs
and
cochrane
were
left
alone
there
were
still
temblors
but
the
sharper
shocks
no
longer
came
there
was
conflagration
in
the
wood
where
the
lurching
ship
had
left
a
long
fresh
streak
of
the
two
castaways
stared
at
the
round
empty
overhead
the
blue
sky
turned
yellow
but
where
the
smoke
from
the
eruption
rose
the
sky
early
became
a
brownish
red
and
presently
the
yellow
faded
to
gold
unburned
green
foliage
all
about
was
singularly
beautiful
in
that
golden
glow
but
it
was
more
beautiful
still
as
the
sky
turned
and
then
carmine
in
turn
and
then
crimson
from
one
horizon
to
the
other
save
where
the
volcanic
marred
the
color
then
the
east
darkened
and
became
a
red
so
deep
as
to
be
practically
black
and
unfamiliar
bright
stars
began
to
peep
through
it
before
darkness
was
complete
cochrane
dragged
burning
branches
from
the
edge
of
the
new
fire
the
heat
was
searing
and
built
a
new
and
smaller
fire
in
the
place
where
the
ship
had
been
this
is
for
warmth
he
explained
briefly
but
so
we
have
light
if
we
need
it
and
it
is
likely
that
animals
will
be
anything
but
afraid
of
it
he
went
off
to
drag
charred
masses
of
burnable
stuff
from
the
first
forest
fire
he
built
a
sort
of
rampart
in
the
very
center
of
the
clearing
he
brought
great
heaps
of
scorched
wood
he
did
not
know
how
much
was
needed
to
keep
the
fire
going
until
dawn
when
he
finished
babs
was
silently
at
work
trying
to
find
out
how
to
keep
the
fire
going
the
burning
parts
had
to
be
kept
together
one
branch
burning
alone
died
out
two
brands
in
contact
kept
each
other
alight
i
sorry
we
have
anything
to
eat
cochrane
told
her
i
not
hungry
she
assured
him
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
there
nothing
to
do
until
morning
unconsciously
cochrane
looked
grim
then
there
be
plenty
food
for
one
thing
we
do
know
actually
whether
or
not
there
anything
really
edible
on
this
planet
for
us
it
could
be
that
there
are
fruits
or
possibly
stalks
or
leaves
that
would
be
nourishing
only
we
do
know
which
is
which
we
have
to
be
careful
we
might
pick
something
like
poison
ivy
babs
said
but
the
ship
will
come
back
of
course
agreed
cochrane
but
it
may
take
them
some
time
to
find
us
this
is
a
pretty
big
planet
you
know
he
estimated
his
supply
of
burnable
stuff
he
improved
the
rampart
he
had
made
at
first
babs
stared
at
him
after
four
or
five
minutes
he
stepped
back
you
can
lean
against
this
he
explained
you
can
watch
the
fire
quite
comfortably
and
it
a
sort
of
wall
the
fire
will
light
one
side
of
you
and
the
wall
will
feel
comforting
behind
you
when
you
get
sleepy
babs
nodded
she
swallowed
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean
when
you
say
they
may
have
trouble
finding
us
because
this
planet
is
so
large
cochrane
nodded
reluctantly
of
course
there
this
space
for
a
marker
he
observed
cheerfully
but
it
could
take
several
days
for
them
to
see
it
babs
swallowed
again
she
said
carefully
the
ship
ca
hover
like
a
helicopter
to
search
you
said
so
it
does
have
fuel
enough
they
ca
really
search
for
us
at
all
the
only
way
to
make
a
real
search
would
be
to
go
back
to
earth
and
bring
back
helicopters
and
fuel
for
them
and
men
to
fly
them
is
that
right
not
necessarily
but
we
do
have
to
figure
on
a
matter
of
well
two
or
three
days
as
a
possibility
babs
moistened
her
lips
and
he
said
quickly
i
did
a
show
once
about
some
miners
lost
in
a
wilderness
a
period
show
in
it
they
knew
that
part
of
their
food
was
poisoned
they
know
what
they
had
to
have
all
their
food
and
of
course
they
have
laboratories
with
which
to
test
for
poison
babs
eyed
him
oddly
they
bandaged
their
arms
said
cochrane
and
put
scraps
of
the
different
foodstuffs
under
the
bandages
the
one
that
was
poisonous
showed
it
affected
the
skin
like
an
i
try
that
trick
in
the
morning
when
there
light
to
pick
samples
by
there
are
berries
and
stuff
there
must
be
fruits
a
few
hours
should
test
them
babs
said
without
intonation
and
we
can
watch
what
the
animals
eat
cochrane
nodded
gravely
animals
on
earth
can
live
on
things
that
to
put
it
mildly
humans
do
not
find
satisfying
grass
for
example
but
it
was
good
for
babs
to
think
of
cheering
things
right
now
there
would
be
plenty
of
discouragement
to
contemplate
later
there
was
a
flicker
of
brightness
in
the
sky
presently
the
earth
quivered
something
made
a
plaintive
sound
off
in
the
night
something
else
made
a
noise
like
the
tinkling
of
bells
there
was
an
abstracted
hooting
presently
which
now
was
nearby
and
now
was
far
away
and
once
they
heard
something
which
was
exactly
like
the
noise
of
water
running
into
a
pool
but
the
source
of
that
particular
burbling
moved
through
the
dark
wood
beyond
the
clearing
it
was
not
wholly
dark
where
they
were
even
aside
from
their
own
small
fire
the
burning
trees
in
the
departing
ship
sent
up
a
column
of
white
which
remaining
flames
illuminated
the
remarkably
primitive
camp
cochrane
had
made
looked
like
a
camp
on
a
tiny
because
of
the
ashes
we
got
to
think
about
shelter
said
babs
presently
very
quietly
indeed
if
there
are
glaciers
there
must
be
winter
here
if
there
is
winter
we
have
to
find
out
which
animals
we
can
eat
and
how
to
store
them
hold
on
protested
cochrane
that
looking
too
far
ahead
babs
clasped
her
hands
together
it
could
have
been
to
keep
their
trembling
from
being
seen
cochrane
was
regarding
her
face
she
kept
that
under
admirable
control
is
it
asked
babs
on
the
broadcast
jamison
said
that
there
was
as
much
land
here
as
on
all
the
continent
of
asia
maybe
he
exaggerated
say
there
only
as
much
land
not
as
there
is
in
south
america
it
all
forest
and
plain
and
uninhabited
she
moistened
her
lips
but
her
voice
was
very
steady
if
all
of
south
america
was
uninhabited
and
there
were
two
people
lost
in
it
and
nobody
knew
where
they
were
how
long
would
it
take
to
find
them
it
would
be
a
matter
of
luck
admitted
cochrane
if
the
ship
comes
back
it
ca
hover
to
look
for
us
there
is
fuel
enough
it
could
spot
us
from
space
if
it
went
in
an
orbit
like
a
space
platform
by
the
time
they
could
get
help
they
would
even
be
sure
we
were
alive
if
we
ca
count
on
being
found
right
away
this
place
will
be
green
again
in
two
or
three
weeks
they
could
find
it
anyhow
cochrane
fidgeted
he
had
worked
out
all
this
for
himself
he
been
disturbed
at
having
to
tell
it
or
even
admit
it
to
babs
now
she
said
in
a
constrained
voice
if
men
came
to
this
planet
and
built
a
city
and
hunted
for
us
it
might
still
be
a
hundred
years
before
anybody
happened
to
come
into
this
valley
looking
for
us
would
be
worse
than
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
i
do
think
we
going
to
be
found
again
cochrane
was
silent
he
felt
guiltily
relieved
that
he
did
not
have
to
break
this
news
to
babs
most
men
have
an
instinctive
feeling
that
a
woman
will
blame
them
for
bad
news
they
hear
a
long
time
later
babs
said
as
quietly
as
before
johnny
simms
asked
me
to
come
along
while
he
went
hunting
i
did
at
least
i
i
not
cast
away
with
him
cochrane
said
gruffly
do
sit
there
and
brood
try
to
get
some
sleep
she
nodded
after
a
long
while
her
head
drooped
she
jerked
awake
again
cochrane
ordered
her
vexedly
to
make
herself
comfortable
she
stretched
out
beside
the
wall
of
wood
that
cochrane
had
made
she
said
quietly
while
we
looking
for
food
tomorrow
morning
we
better
keep
our
eyes
open
for
a
place
to
build
a
house
she
closed
her
eyes
cochrane
kept
watch
through
the
dark
hours
he
heard
in
the
forest
and
once
toward
dawn
the
distant
volcano
seemed
to
undergo
a
fresh
paroxysm
of
activity
boomings
and
explosions
rumbled
in
the
night
there
were
flickerings
in
the
sky
but
there
were
fewer
temblors
after
it
and
no
shocks
at
all
more
than
once
cochrane
found
himself
dozing
it
was
difficult
to
stay
in
a
state
of
alarm
there
was
but
one
single
outcry
in
the
forest
that
sounded
like
the
shriek
of
a
creature
seized
by
a
carnivore
that
was
not
nearby
he
tried
to
make
plans
he
felt
bitterly
that
he
knew
so
few
of
the
things
that
would
be
useful
to
a
castaway
but
he
had
been
a
city
man
all
his
life
woodcraft
was
not
only
out
of
his
experience
on
overcrowded
earth
it
would
have
been
completely
useless
from
time
to
time
he
found
himself
thinking
instead
of
practical
matters
of
the
astonishing
sturdiness
of
spirit
babs
displayed
when
she
waked
well
after
daybreak
and
sat
up
blinking
he
said
er
babs
we
in
this
together
from
now
on
if
you
want
to
tell
me
something
for
my
own
good
go
ahead
right
she
rubbed
her
eyes
on
her
knuckles
and
said
i
have
done
that
anyhow
for
both
our
good
do
you
think
better
try
to
find
a
place
where
we
can
get
a
drink
of
water
water
has
to
be
right
to
drink
they
set
off
cochrane
carrying
the
weapon
he
brought
from
the
ship
it
was
babs
who
pointed
out
that
a
stream
should
almost
certainly
be
found
where
rain
would
descend
downhill
babs
too
spotted
one
of
the
small
furry
bipeds
feasting
gluttonously
on
small
round
objects
that
grew
from
the
base
of
a
small
tree
instead
of
on
its
branches
the
tree
evidently
depended
on
rather
than
on
flying
creatures
to
scatter
its
seeds
they
gathered
samples
of
the
fruit
cochrane
peeled
a
sliver
of
the
meat
from
one
of
the
round
objects
and
put
it
under
his
watchstrap
they
found
a
stream
they
found
other
fruits
and
cochrane
prepared
the
same
test
for
them
as
for
the
first
one
of
the
samples
turned
his
skin
red
and
angry
almost
immediately
he
discarded
it
and
all
the
fruits
of
the
kind
from
which
it
came
at
midday
they
tasted
the
fruit
the
flesh
was
red
and
juicy
there
was
a
texture
it
was
satisfying
to
chew
on
the
taste
was
indeterminate
save
for
a
very
mild
flavor
of
maple
and
peppermint
mixed
together
they
had
no
symptoms
of
distress
afterward
other
fruits
were
less
satisfactory
of
the
samples
which
the
said
were
one
was
acrid
and
astringent
and
two
others
had
no
taste
except
that
of
greenness
practically
the
taste
of
any
leaf
one
might
chew
i
suppose
said
cochrane
wryly
as
they
headed
back
toward
the
at
nightfall
we
got
to
find
out
if
the
animals
can
be
eaten
babs
nodded
yes
tonight
i
taking
part
of
the
watch
as
you
remarked
this
morning
we
in
this
together
he
looked
at
her
sharply
and
she
flushed
i
mean
it
she
said
doggedly
i
watching
part
of
the
night
he
was
desperately
tired
his
muscles
were
not
yet
back
to
normal
after
the
low
gravity
on
the
moon
she
had
more
rest
than
he
he
had
to
let
her
help
but
there
was
embarrassment
between
them
because
it
looked
as
if
they
would
have
to
spend
the
rest
of
their
lives
together
and
they
had
not
made
the
decision
it
had
been
made
for
them
and
they
had
not
acknowledged
it
yet
when
they
reached
the
clearing
cochrane
began
to
drag
new
logs
toward
the
central
place
where
much
of
last
night
supply
of
fuel
remained
babs
began
to
haul
stuff
with
him
he
said
vexedly
quit
it
i
already
been
realizing
how
little
i
know
about
the
things
we
going
to
need
to
survive
let
me
fool
myself
about
masculine
strength
anyhow
she
smiled
at
him
a
very
little
but
she
went
obediently
to
the
fire
to
experiment
with
cookery
of
the
one
palatable
variety
of
fruit
from
this
planet
trees
he
drove
himself
to
bring
more
wood
than
before
when
he
settled
down
she
said
absorbedly
try
this
jed
then
she
flushed
hotly
because
she
inadvertently
used
his
familiar
name
but
she
extended
something
that
was
toasted
and
not
too
much
burned
he
ate
with
weariness
sweeping
over
him
like
a
wave
the
cooked
fruit
was
almost
a
normal
food
but
it
did
need
salt
there
would
be
trouble
finding
salt
on
this
planet
the
water
that
should
be
in
the
seas
was
frozen
in
the
glaciers
salt
would
not
have
been
leached
out
of
the
soil
and
gathered
in
the
seas
it
would
be
a
serious
problem
but
cochrane
was
very
tired
indeed
i
take
the
first
two
hours
said
babs
briskly
then
i
wake
you
he
showed
her
how
to
use
the
weapon
he
meant
to
let
himself
drift
quietly
off
to
sleep
acting
as
if
he
had
a
little
trouble
going
off
but
he
did
he
lay
down
and
the
next
thing
he
knew
babs
was
shaking
him
violently
in
the
first
dazed
instant
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
thought
they
were
surrounded
by
forest
fire
but
it
was
that
it
was
dawn
and
babs
had
let
him
sleep
the
whole
night
through
and
the
sky
was
from
one
horizon
to
the
other
more
he
heard
the
cries
of
creatures
in
the
forest
but
also
he
heard
a
roaring
sound
very
thin
and
far
away
which
could
only
be
one
thing
jed
jed
get
up
quick
the
ship
coming
back
the
ship
we
got
to
move
she
dragged
him
to
his
feet
he
was
suddenly
he
ran
with
her
he
flung
back
his
head
and
stared
up
as
he
ran
there
was
a
of
flame
and
vapor
almost
directly
overhead
it
grew
swiftly
in
size
it
plunged
downward
they
reached
the
surrounding
forest
and
plunged
into
it
babs
stumbled
and
cochrane
caught
her
and
they
ran
onward
hand
in
hand
to
get
clear
away
from
the
of
the
rockets
the
grew
louder
and
louder
the
castaways
gazed
it
was
the
ship
from
below
fierce
flames
poured
down
and
raging
the
silver
hull
slanted
a
little
it
shifted
its
line
of
descent
it
came
down
with
a
peculiar
deftness
of
handling
that
cochrane
had
not
realized
before
its
rockets
splashed
but
the
flame
did
not
extend
out
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
that
had
been
burned
off
at
first
the
indeed
did
not
approach
the
proportion
to
be
seen
on
rockets
on
or
as
cochrane
had
seen
below
the
descending
on
earth
the
ship
settled
within
yards
of
its
original
its
rockets
dwindled
but
remained
burning
they
dwindled
again
the
noise
was
outrageous
but
still
not
the
intolerable
tumult
of
a
landing
on
earth
the
rockets
cut
off
the
airlock
door
opened
cochrane
and
babs
waved
cheerfully
from
the
edge
of
the
clearing
holden
appeared
in
the
door
and
shouted
down
sorry
to
be
so
long
coming
back
he
waved
and
vanished
they
had
of
course
to
wait
until
the
ground
at
least
partly
cooled
before
the
could
be
used
around
them
the
noises
of
the
forest
continued
there
were
cooling
crackling
sounds
from
the
ship
i
wonder
how
they
found
their
way
back
said
babs
i
did
think
they
ever
could
did
you
babs
said
cochrane
you
lied
to
me
you
said
you
wake
me
in
two
hours
but
you
let
me
sleep
all
night
you
let
me
sleep
the
night
before
she
told
him
composedly
i
was
fresher
than
you
were
and
today
have
been
a
pretty
bad
one
we
were
going
to
try
to
kill
some
animals
you
needed
the
rest
cochrane
said
slowly
i
found
out
something
babs
why
you
could
face
things
why
we
humans
have
all
gone
mad
i
think
i
gotten
the
woman
viewpoint
now
babs
i
like
it
she
inspected
the
looming
of
the
ship
now
waiting
for
the
ground
to
cool
so
they
could
come
aboard
i
think
we
have
made
out
if
the
ship
had
come
cochrane
told
her
we
have
had
a
woman
viewpoint
to
work
from
yours
you
looked
ahead
to
building
a
house
of
course
you
thought
of
finding
food
but
you
were
thinking
of
the
possibility
of
winter
and
building
a
house
you
thinking
only
of
survival
you
were
thinking
far
ahead
women
must
think
farther
ahead
than
men
do
babs
looked
at
him
briefly
and
then
returned
to
her
apparently
absorbed
contemplation
of
the
ship
that
what
the
matter
with
people
back
on
earth
cochrane
said
urgently
there
no
frustration
as
long
as
women
can
look
ahead
far
ahead
past
here
and
now
when
women
can
do
that
they
can
keep
men
going
it
when
there
nothing
to
plan
for
that
men
ca
go
on
because
women
ca
hope
you
see
you
saw
a
city
here
a
little
city
with
separate
homes
on
earth
too
many
people
ca
think
of
more
than
and
keeping
food
enough
for
them
them
only
coming
in
they
ca
hope
for
more
and
it
when
that
happens
you
see
babs
did
not
answer
cochrane
fumbled
he
said
angrily
confound
it
ca
you
see
what
i
trying
to
say
we
have
been
better
off
as
castaways
than
back
on
earth
crowded
and
scared
of
our
jobs
i
saying
i
rather
stay
here
with
you
than
go
back
to
the
way
i
was
living
before
we
started
off
on
this
voyage
i
think
the
two
of
us
could
make
out
under
any
circumstances
i
do
want
to
try
to
make
out
without
you
it
is
sense
then
he
scowled
helplessly
dammit
staged
plenty
of
shows
in
which
a
man
asked
a
girl
to
marry
him
and
they
were
all
phoney
it
different
now
that
mean
it
what
a
good
way
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
babs
looked
momentarily
up
into
his
face
she
smiled
ever
so
faintly
they
watching
us
from
the
ports
she
said
if
you
want
my
viewpoint
if
we
were
to
wave
to
them
that
we
be
right
back
we
can
get
some
more
of
those
fruits
i
cooked
it
might
be
interesting
to
have
some
to
show
them
he
scowled
more
deeply
than
before
i
sorry
you
feel
that
way
but
if
that
it
and
on
the
way
said
babs
when
they
not
watching
you
might
kiss
me
they
had
a
considerable
pile
of
the
fruits
ready
when
the
ground
had
cooled
enough
for
them
to
reach
the
once
aboard
the
ship
cochrane
headed
for
the
with
jamison
and
bell
tagging
after
him
bell
had
an
argument
but
the
volcano
calmed
down
there
only
a
wall
of
steam
where
the
lava
hit
the
glaciers
and
we
could
fix
up
a
story
in
a
couple
of
hours
i
got
background
shots
you
and
babs
could
make
the
and
we
have
a
castaway
story
perfect
the
first
true
castaway
story
from
the
stars
you
know
what
that
would
mean
cochrane
snarled
at
him
try
it
and
i
tear
you
limb
from
limb
i
put
enough
of
other
people
private
lives
on
the
screen
my
own
stays
off
i
not
going
to
have
even
a
phoney
built
around
babs
and
me
for
people
to
gabble
about
bell
said
in
an
injured
tone
i
only
trying
to
do
a
good
job
i
started
off
on
this
business
as
a
writer
i
have
had
a
real
chance
to
show
what
i
can
do
with
this
sort
of
material
forget
it
cochrane
snapped
again
stick
to
your
cameras
jamison
said
hopefully
you
give
me
some
data
on
plants
and
animals
cochrane
you
i
doing
a
book
with
bell
pictures
and
let
me
alone
raged
cochrane
he
reached
the
al
the
pilot
sat
at
the
controls
with
an
air
of
special
alertness
you
all
right
for
our
lined
up
trip
we
ought
to
leave
in
about
twenty
minutes
we
be
pointing
just
about
right
then
i
all
right
said
cochrane
and
you
can
take
off
when
you
please
to
jones
he
said
how
you
find
us
i
did
think
it
could
be
done
doctor
holden
figured
it
out
said
jones
simple
enough
but
i
was
lost
when
the
came
everybody
else
ran
to
the
ship
we
waited
for
you
you
did
come
it
had
been
of
course
because
cochrane
would
not
risk
taking
babs
through
a
forest
in
which
trees
were
falling
we
finally
had
to
choose
between
taking
off
and
crashing
so
we
took
off
that
was
quite
right
we
all
be
messed
up
if
you
had
cochrane
told
him
jones
waved
his
hands
i
did
think
we
could
ever
find
you
again
we
were
sixty
away
when
that
booster
effect
died
out
then
doctor
holden
got
on
the
communicator
he
got
earth
the
astronomers
back
there
located
us
and
gave
us
the
line
to
get
back
by
we
found
the
planet
even
then
i
see
how
we
pick
out
the
valley
but
doc
had
had
checking
the
shots
we
transmitted
as
we
were
making
our
landing
we
had
the
whole
first
approach
on
they
put
a
crowd
of
to
work
we
went
in
a
space
platform
orbit
around
the
planet
transmitting
what
we
saw
from
out
there
they
figured
the
orbit
for
us
too
and
they
checked
what
we
transmitted
against
what
we
photographed
going
down
so
they
were
able
to
spot
the
exact
valley
and
tell
us
where
to
come
down
we
actually
spotted
this
valley
last
night
but
we
could
land
in
the
dark
cochrane
felt
abashed
i
could
have
done
that
job
he
admitted
so
i
did
think
anybody
could
hm
did
all
this
cost
a
lot
of
fuel
jones
actually
smiled
i
worked
out
something
we
do
use
as
much
fuel
as
we
did
probably
using
too
much
now
al
go
ahead
and
lift
i
want
to
check
what
the
new
stuff
does
anyhow
take
off
the
pilot
threw
a
switch
and
jones
threw
another
a
newly
installed
one
just
added
to
his
improvised
a
light
glowed
brightly
al
pressed
one
button
very
gently
a
roaring
set
up
outside
the
ship
started
up
there
was
practically
no
feeling
of
acceleration
this
time
the
ship
rose
lightly
even
the
was
mild
indeed
compared
to
its
from
luna
and
the
sound
of
its
first
landing
on
the
planet
just
below
cochrane
saw
the
valley
floors
recede
and
drop
below
from
all
directions
then
valleys
flowed
toward
the
ship
and
underneath
glaciers
appeared
and
volcanic
cones
and
then
enormous
stretches
of
white
with
smoking
dots
here
and
there
upon
it
in
seconds
it
seemed
the
horizon
was
visibly
curved
in
other
seconds
the
planet
being
left
behind
was
a
monstrous
white
ball
and
there
were
patches
of
intolerable
white
sunlight
coming
in
the
ports
and
cochrane
felt
queer
jones
had
given
the
order
for
jones
had
determined
to
leave
at
this
moment
because
jones
had
tests
he
wanted
to
make
cochrane
felt
like
a
passenger
from
the
man
who
decided
things
because
he
was
the
one
who
knew
what
had
to
be
done
he
had
become
something
else
he
had
been
absent
two
nights
and
part
of
a
day
and
decisions
had
been
made
in
which
he
had
no
part
it
felt
queer
it
felt
even
startling
we
in
a
modification
of
the
modified
dabney
field
now
observed
jones
in
a
gratified
tone
you
know
the
original
theory
i
do
acknowledged
cochrane
the
field
always
a
pipe
a
tube
a
column
of
stressed
space
between
the
jones
reminded
him
when
we
landed
the
first
time
back
yonder
the
tail
of
the
ship
was
in
the
field
at
all
the
field
stretched
from
the
bow
of
the
ship
only
out
to
that
last
balloon
we
dropped
we
were
letting
down
at
an
angle
to
that
line
it
was
like
a
kite
and
a
string
and
the
kite
tail
the
string
was
the
dabney
field
and
the
directions
we
were
heading
was
the
kite
tail
cochrane
nodded
it
occurred
to
him
that
jones
was
very
much
unlike
dabney
jones
had
discovered
the
dabney
field
but
having
sold
the
to
it
he
now
apparently
thought
dabney
field
was
the
proper
technical
term
for
his
own
discovery
even
in
his
own
mind
back
on
the
moon
jones
went
on
zestfully
i
was
sure
that
a
field
once
established
would
hold
in
atmosphere
i
hoped
that
with
enough
power
i
could
keep
it
but
i
was
sure
this
does
mean
much
to
me
jones
said
cochrane
what
does
it
add
up
to
why
the
field
held
down
into
atmosphere
and
we
were
out
of
the
primary
field
as
far
as
the
tail
of
the
ship
was
concerned
but
this
time
we
landed
i
hooked
in
some
circuits
there
was
a
second
dabney
field
from
the
stern
of
the
ship
to
the
bow
there
was
the
main
one
going
out
to
those
balloons
and
then
back
to
earth
but
there
was
and
is
a
second
one
only
enclosing
the
ship
it
a
sort
of
bubble
we
can
still
trail
a
field
behind
us
and
anybody
can
follow
in
any
sort
of
ship
that
put
into
it
but
now
the
ship
has
a
completely
independent
second
field
its
tail
is
never
outside
cochrane
did
not
have
the
sort
of
mind
to
find
such
information
either
lucid
or
suggestive
so
what
happens
we
have
both
plates
of
a
dabney
field
always
with
us
said
jones
triumphantly
we
always
in
a
field
even
landing
in
atmosphere
and
the
ship
has
practically
no
mass
even
when
it
letting
down
to
landing
it
has
weight
but
next
to
no
mass
did
you
notice
the
difference
stupid
as
it
may
seem
i
did
admitted
cochrane
i
have
the
least
idea
what
you
talking
about
jones
looked
at
him
patiently
now
we
can
shoot
our
exhaust
out
of
the
field
the
not
the
main
one
i
still
numb
said
cochrane
multiple
sclerosis
of
the
i
suppose
let
me
just
take
your
word
for
it
jones
tried
once
more
try
to
see
it
listen
when
we
landed
the
first
time
we
had
to
use
a
lot
of
fuel
because
the
tail
of
the
ship
was
in
the
dabney
field
it
had
mass
so
we
had
to
use
a
lot
of
to
slow
down
that
mass
in
the
field
the
ship
has
much
mass
the
amount
depends
on
the
strength
of
the
field
but
rockets
depend
for
their
thrust
on
the
mass
that
thrown
away
astern
looked
at
that
way
rockets
should
push
hard
in
a
dabney
field
there
ought
to
be
any
gain
to
be
had
by
the
field
at
all
you
see
cochrane
fumbled
in
his
head
oh
yes
i
thought
of
that
but
there
is
an
advantage
the
ship
does
work
because
said
jones
triumphant
again
the
depends
partly
on
temperature
the
gases
in
the
are
hot
away
up
in
the
thousands
of
degrees
they
do
have
normal
inertia
but
they
do
have
what
you
might
call
they
acquire
a
sort
of
fictitious
mass
when
they
get
hot
enough
so
we
carry
along
fuel
that
has
any
inertia
to
speak
of
when
it
cold
but
acquires
a
lunatic
sort
of
substitute
for
inertia
when
it
genuinely
hot
so
a
ship
can
travel
in
a
dabney
field
i
relieved
acknowledged
cochrane
i
thought
you
were
about
to
tell
me
that
we
could
lift
off
the
moon
and
i
was
going
to
ask
how
we
got
here
jones
smiled
patiently
what
i
telling
you
now
is
that
we
can
shoot
out
of
the
dabney
field
we
make
with
the
stern
of
the
ship
landing
we
keep
our
fuel
and
the
ship
with
next
to
no
mass
and
we
shoot
it
out
to
where
it
does
have
mass
and
the
effect
is
practically
the
same
as
if
we
were
pushing
against
something
solid
and
so
we
started
off
with
fuel
for
maybe
five
or
six
landings
and
against
earth
gravity
but
with
this
new
trick
we
got
fuel
for
a
couple
of
hundred
ah
said
cochrane
mildly
this
is
the
first
thing
you
said
that
meant
anything
to
me
congratulations
what
comes
next
i
thought
you
be
pleased
said
jones
what
i
really
telling
you
is
that
now
we
got
fuel
enough
to
reach
the
milky
way
let
not
suggested
cochrane
and
say
we
did
you
got
a
new
star
picked
out
to
travel
to
jones
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
him
the
gesture
indicated
practically
hysterical
frustration
but
he
said
yes
back
on
earth
they
anxious
for
us
to
check
on
suns
and
planets
for
once
said
cochrane
i
am
one
with
the
great
scientific
minds
let
go
over
he
made
his
way
to
the
circular
stairway
leading
down
to
the
main
saloon
on
his
clumsy
way
across
the
saloon
floor
to
the
communicator
he
felt
the
peculiar
sensation
of
the
which
should
have
been
a
sound
but
was
it
was
the
sensation
which
had
preceded
the
preposterous
leap
of
the
away
from
luna
when
in
a
of
time
all
stars
looked
like
streaks
of
light
and
the
ship
traveled
nearly
two
sunshine
blinked
and
then
shone
again
in
the
ports
around
the
saloon
walls
the
second
shining
came
from
a
different
direction
as
if
somebody
had
switched
off
one
exterior
light
and
turned
on
another
and
at
a
different
angle
to
the
floor
cochrane
reached
the
communicator
he
felt
no
weight
he
strapped
himself
into
the
chair
he
switched
on
the
which
sent
radiation
along
the
field
to
a
balloon
two
hundred
odd
from
earth
that
was
the
balloon
near
the
glacier
planet
and
then
switched
to
the
field
traveling
to
a
second
balloon
then
the
last
hundred
back
to
the
moon
and
then
from
luna
city
down
to
earth
he
put
in
his
call
he
got
an
emergency
message
that
had
been
waiting
for
him
seconds
later
he
fought
his
way
frantically
through
to
the
again
jamison
bell
he
cried
desperately
we
got
a
broadcast
due
in
twenty
minutes
i
lost
track
of
time
we
sponsored
on
four
continents
and
we
damwell
have
to
put
on
a
show
what
the
devil
why
somebody
jamison
said
obviously
from
a
where
he
swung
a
squat
from
one
object
to
another
that
a
we
be
squashed
if
we
landed
there
though
that
big
moon
looks
promising
i
think
we
better
try
yonder
okay
said
jones
in
a
flat
voice
center
on
the
next
one
in
al
and
we
toddle
over
cochrane
felt
the
ship
swinging
in
emptiness
he
knew
because
it
seemed
to
turn
while
he
felt
that
he
stayed
still
we
got
a
show
to
put
on
he
raged
we
got
to
fake
something
jamison
looked
aside
from
his
telescope
tell
him
bell
he
said
expansively
i
wrote
a
script
of
sorts
said
bell
apologetically
the
not
so
good
that
why
i
wanted
a
castaway
narrative
to
put
in
it
though
i
would
have
had
time
really
we
spliced
film
and
jamison
narrated
it
and
you
can
run
it
off
it
a
kind
of
show
we
ran
it
as
a
survey
of
the
basing
it
on
pictures
we
took
while
we
were
in
orbit
around
it
it
a
sort
of
travelogue
jamison
did
himself
proud
alicia
can
find
the
for
you
he
went
back
to
his
cameras
cochrane
saw
a
monstrous
globe
swing
past
a
port
it
was
a
featureless
mass
of
clouds
save
for
striations
across
what
must
be
its
equator
it
looked
like
the
lunar
observatory
pictures
of
jupiter
back
in
the
sun
family
of
planets
it
went
past
the
port
and
a
moon
swam
into
view
it
was
a
very
large
moon
it
had
at
least
one
and
therefore
an
atmosphere
and
there
were
mottlings
of
its
surface
which
could
hardly
be
anything
but
continents
and
seas
we
got
to
put
a
show
on
raged
cochrane
and
now
it
all
set
bell
assured
him
you
can
transmit
it
i
hope
you
like
it
cochrane
sputtered
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
transmit
whatever
bell
and
jamison
had
gotten
ready
he
swam
with
nightmarelike
difficulty
back
to
the
communicator
he
shouted
frantically
for
babs
she
and
alicia
came
alicia
found
the
and
cochrane
threaded
it
into
the
transmitter
and
bitterly
ran
the
first
few
feet
babs
smiled
at
him
and
alicia
looked
at
him
oddly
evidently
babs
had
confided
the
consequence
of
their
but
cochrane
faced
an
emergency
he
began
to
check
timings
with
earth
when
the
ship
approached
a
second
planet
cochrane
saw
nothing
of
it
he
was
furiously
monitoring
the
broadcast
of
a
show
in
which
he
had
no
hand
at
all
from
his
own
professional
standpoint
it
was
terrible
jamison
spouted
interminably
so
cochrane
considered
al
the
pilot
was
actually
interviewed
by
an
offscreen
voice
but
the
pictures
from
space
were
excellent
while
the
ship
floated
in
orbit
waiting
to
descend
to
pick
up
babs
and
cochrane
bell
had
hooked
his
camera
to
an
amplifying
telescope
and
he
did
have
magnificent
shots
of
dramatic
terrain
on
the
planet
now
twenty
behind
cochrane
watched
the
show
in
a
mingling
of
jealousy
and
relief
it
was
not
as
good
as
he
would
have
done
but
fortunately
bell
and
jamison
had
stuck
fairly
close
to
straight
and
shots
of
vegetation
and
animals
had
been
interspersed
with
the
remoter
pictures
with
moderate
competence
if
without
undue
imagination
an
audience
which
had
not
seen
many
shows
of
the
kind
would
be
thrilled
it
even
amounted
to
a
valid
change
of
pace
anybody
who
watched
this
would
at
least
want
to
see
more
and
different
pictures
from
the
stars
halfway
through
he
heard
the
noise
of
rockets
he
knew
the
ship
was
descending
through
atmosphere
by
the
steady
sound
though
he
had
not
the
faintest
idea
what
was
outside
he
ground
his
teeth
as
for
timing
he
received
the
commercial
inserted
in
the
film
the
commercials
served
the
purpose
of
course
he
could
not
watch
the
other
pictures
shown
to
residents
of
other
than
north
america
in
the
commercial
portions
of
the
show
he
was
counting
seconds
to
resume
transmission
when
he
felt
the
slight
but
distant
impact
which
meant
that
the
ship
had
touched
ground
a
very
short
time
after
even
the
lessened
precautionary
cut
off
cochrane
ground
his
teeth
the
ship
had
landed
on
a
planet
he
had
not
seen
and
in
whose
choice
he
had
had
no
hand
he
was
humiliated
the
other
members
of
the
ship
company
looked
out
at
scenes
no
other
human
eyes
had
ever
beheld
he
regarded
the
final
commercial
inserted
into
the
broadcast
for
its
american
sponsor
it
showed
purportedly
the
true
story
of
two
girl
friends
one
blonde
and
one
brunette
who
were
at
all
parties
they
tried
frantically
to
remedy
the
situation
by
the
use
of
this
toothpaste
and
that
and
this
deodorant
and
the
other
in
vain
but
then
they
became
the
centers
of
all
the
festivities
they
attended
as
soon
as
they
began
to
wash
their
hair
with
rayglo
shampoo
holden
and
johnny
simms
came
clattering
down
from
the
together
they
looked
excited
they
plunged
together
toward
the
that
would
take
them
to
the
deck
on
which
the
airlock
opened
holden
panted
jed
creatures
outside
they
look
like
men
the
faithfully
monitored
the
end
of
the
commercial
two
charming
girls
radiant
and
lovely
raised
their
voices
in
grateful
song
hymning
the
virtues
of
rayglo
shampoo
there
followed
brisk
reminders
of
the
superlative
magical
results
obtained
by
those
who
used
rayglo
foundation
cream
rayglo
kisspruf
lipstick
and
rayglo
home
permanent
in
four
strengths
for
normal
and
children
hair
cochrane
heard
the
clanking
of
the
airlock
door
chapter
nine
he
made
for
the
where
the
ports
offered
the
highest
and
widest
and
best
views
of
everything
outside
when
he
arrived
babs
and
alicia
stood
together
staring
out
and
down
bell
frantically
worked
a
camera
jamison
gaped
at
the
outer
world
al
the
pilot
made
frustrated
gestures
not
quite
daring
to
leave
his
controls
while
there
was
even
an
outside
chance
the
ship
might
find
flaws
in
their
support
jones
adjusted
something
on
the
new
set
of
controls
he
had
established
for
the
extra
dabney
field
jones
was
not
wholly
normal
in
some
ways
he
was
absorbed
in
technical
matters
even
more
fully
than
cochrane
in
his
own
commercial
enterprises
cochrane
pushed
to
a
port
to
see
the
ship
had
landed
in
a
small
glade
there
were
trees
nearby
the
trees
had
extremely
long
lanceolate
leaves
roughly
the
shape
of
stretched
out
even
longer
in
the
gentle
breeze
that
blew
outside
they
waved
extravagantly
there
were
hills
in
the
distance
and
nearby
of
gray
rocks
this
sky
was
blue
like
the
sky
of
earth
it
was
of
course
inevitable
that
any
colorless
atmosphere
with
suspended
in
it
would
establish
a
blue
sky
holden
was
visible
below
moving
toward
a
patch
of
vegetation
rising
some
seven
or
eight
feet
from
the
rolling
soil
he
had
hopped
quickly
over
the
scorched
area
immediately
outside
the
ship
it
was
much
smaller
than
that
made
by
the
first
landing
on
the
other
planet
but
even
so
he
had
probably
damaged
his
footwear
to
excess
but
he
now
stood
a
hundred
yards
from
the
ship
he
made
gestures
he
seemed
to
be
talking
as
if
trying
to
persuade
some
living
creature
to
show
itself
we
saw
them
peeping
said
babs
breathlessly
coming
beside
cochrane
once
one
of
them
ran
from
one
patch
of
reeds
to
another
it
looked
like
a
man
there
are
at
least
three
of
them
in
there
whatever
they
are
they
ca
be
men
said
cochrane
grimly
they
ca
johnny
simms
was
not
in
sight
where
simms
he
has
a
gun
said
babs
he
was
going
to
get
one
anyhow
so
he
could
protect
doctor
holden
cochrane
glanced
straight
down
the
airlock
door
was
open
and
the
end
of
a
weapon
peered
out
johnny
simms
might
be
in
a
better
position
there
to
protect
holden
by
but
he
was
assuredly
safer
himself
there
was
no
movement
anywhere
holden
did
not
move
closer
to
the
reeds
he
still
seemed
to
be
speaking
soothingly
to
the
unseen
creatures
why
ca
there
be
men
here
asked
babs
i
do
mean
actually
men
but
manlike
creatures
why
could
there
be
rational
creatures
like
us
i
know
you
said
so
but
cochrane
shook
his
head
he
believed
implicitly
that
there
could
not
be
men
on
this
planet
on
the
glacier
planet
every
animal
had
been
separately
devised
from
the
creatures
of
earth
there
were
resemblances
explicable
as
the
result
of
parallel
evolution
by
analogy
there
could
not
be
exactly
identical
mankind
on
another
world
because
evolution
there
would
be
parallel
but
not
the
same
but
if
there
were
even
a
mental
equal
to
men
no
matter
how
unhuman
such
a
creature
might
appear
if
there
were
a
really
rational
animal
anywhere
in
the
cosmos
off
of
earth
the
result
would
be
catastrophic
we
humans
cochrane
told
her
live
by
our
conceit
we
demand
more
than
animality
of
ourselves
because
we
believe
we
are
more
than
animals
and
we
believe
we
are
the
only
creatures
that
are
if
we
came
to
believe
we
were
not
unique
but
were
simply
a
cleverer
animal
be
finished
every
nation
has
always
started
to
destroy
itself
every
time
such
an
idea
spread
but
we
are
only
clever
animals
protested
babs
we
unique
cochrane
glanced
at
her
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
quite
true
holden
still
stood
patiently
before
the
patch
of
reeds
still
seemed
to
talk
still
with
his
hands
outstretched
in
what
men
consider
the
universal
sign
of
peace
there
was
a
sudden
movement
at
the
back
of
the
quite
fifty
yards
from
holden
a
thing
which
did
look
like
a
man
fled
madly
for
the
nearest
edge
of
woodland
it
was
the
size
of
a
man
it
had
the
color
of
naked
human
flesh
it
ran
with
its
head
down
and
it
could
not
be
seen
too
clearly
but
it
was
startlingly
manlike
in
outline
up
in
the
bell
fairly
yipped
with
excitement
and
swung
his
camera
holden
remained
oblivious
he
still
tried
to
lure
something
out
of
concealment
a
second
creature
raced
for
the
woods
tiny
gray
threads
appeared
in
the
air
between
the
airlock
and
the
racing
thing
smoke
johnny
simms
was
shooting
zestfully
at
the
unidentified
animal
he
was
using
that
tracer
ammunition
which
poor
shots
and
worse
sportsmen
adopt
to
make
up
for
bad
marksmanship
the
threads
of
smoke
seemed
to
form
a
net
about
the
running
things
they
dodged
and
frantically
both
of
them
reached
safety
a
third
tried
it
and
now
johnny
simms
turned
on
automatic
fire
bullets
spurted
from
his
weapon
trailing
threads
of
smoke
so
that
the
trails
looked
like
a
stream
from
a
hose
the
stream
swept
through
the
space
occupied
by
the
fugitive
it
leaped
convulsively
and
crashed
to
earth
it
kicked
blindly
cochrane
swore
between
the
instant
of
the
beginning
of
the
flight
and
this
instant
less
than
two
seconds
had
passed
the
threads
which
were
drifted
away
then
a
new
thread
streaked
out
johnny
simms
fired
once
more
at
his
victim
it
kicked
violently
and
was
still
holden
turned
angrily
there
seemed
to
be
shoutings
between
him
and
johnny
simms
then
holden
trudged
around
the
there
was
no
longer
any
sign
of
life
in
the
still
shape
on
the
ground
but
it
was
normal
precaution
not
to
walk
into
a
thicket
in
which
unknown
large
living
things
had
recently
been
sighted
johnny
simms
fired
again
and
again
from
his
post
in
the
airlock
the
smoke
which
traced
his
bullets
ranged
to
the
woodland
he
shot
at
imagined
targets
there
he
fired
at
his
previous
victim
simply
because
it
was
something
to
shoot
at
he
shot
recklessly
foolishly
alicia
his
wife
touched
jamison
on
the
arm
and
spoke
to
him
urgently
jamison
followed
her
reluctantly
down
the
stairs
she
would
be
going
to
the
airlock
johnny
simms
shooting
at
the
landscape
might
shoot
holden
a
thread
of
passed
within
feet
of
holden
body
he
turned
and
shouted
back
at
the
ship
the
inner
airlock
door
clanked
open
there
was
the
sound
of
a
shot
and
the
dead
thing
was
hit
again
the
bullet
had
been
fired
dangerously
close
to
holden
there
were
voices
below
johnny
simms
bellowed
enragedly
alicia
cried
out
there
was
silence
below
but
cochrane
was
already
plunging
toward
the
stairs
babs
followed
closely
when
they
rushed
down
onto
the
deck
they
found
alicia
deathly
white
but
with
a
flaming
red
mark
on
her
cheek
they
found
johnny
simms
roaring
with
rage
waving
the
weapon
he
been
shooting
jamison
was
uneasily
in
the
act
of
trying
to
placate
bellowed
johnny
simms
i
came
on
this
ship
to
hunt
i
going
to
hunt
try
and
stop
me
he
waved
his
weapon
i
paid
my
money
he
shouted
i
wo
take
orders
from
anybody
nobody
can
boss
me
cochrane
said
icily
i
can
stop
being
a
fool
put
down
that
gun
you
nearly
shot
holden
you
might
still
kill
somebody
put
it
down
he
walked
grimly
toward
johnny
simms
johnny
was
near
the
open
airlock
door
the
outer
door
was
open
too
he
could
not
retreat
he
edged
sidewise
cochrane
changed
the
direction
of
his
advance
there
are
people
like
johnny
simms
everywhere
as
a
rule
they
are
not
classed
as
unable
to
tell
right
from
wrong
unless
they
are
rich
enough
to
hire
a
psychiatrist
yet
a
variable
but
percentage
of
the
human
race
ignores
rules
of
conduct
at
all
times
they
are
the
handicap
the
burden
the
main
hindrance
to
the
maintenance
or
the
progress
of
civilization
they
are
not
consciously
evil
they
simply
do
not
bother
to
act
otherwise
than
as
rational
animals
the
rest
of
humanity
has
to
defend
itself
with
police
with
laws
and
sometimes
with
revolts
though
those
like
johnny
simms
have
no
motive
beyond
the
indulgence
of
immediate
inclinations
but
for
that
indulgence
johnny
would
risk
any
injury
to
anybody
else
he
edged
further
aside
cochrane
was
white
with
disgusted
fury
johnny
simms
went
into
panic
he
raised
his
weapon
aiming
at
cochrane
keep
back
he
cried
ferociously
i
do
care
if
i
kill
you
and
he
did
not
it
was
the
stark
senselessness
which
makes
juvenile
delinquents
and
hitlers
and
causes
thugs
and
hoodlums
and
snide
lawyers
and
tricky
business
men
it
was
the
pure
perversity
which
makes
sane
men
frustrate
it
was
an
example
of
that
infinite
stupidity
which
is
crime
but
is
also
only
stupidity
cochrane
saw
babs
pulling
competently
at
one
of
the
chairs
at
one
of
the
tables
nearby
he
stopped
and
johnny
simms
took
courage
cochrane
said
icily
just
what
the
hell
do
you
think
we
here
for
anyhow
johnny
simms
eyes
were
wide
and
blank
like
the
eyes
of
a
small
boy
in
a
frenzy
of
destruction
when
he
has
forgotten
what
he
started
out
to
do
and
has
become
obsessed
with
what
damage
he
is
doing
i
not
going
to
be
pushed
around
cried
johnny
simms
more
ferociously
still
from
now
on
i
going
to
tell
you
what
to
do
babs
swung
the
chair
she
had
slid
from
its
fastenings
it
came
down
with
a
satisfying
on
johnny
simms
head
his
gun
went
off
the
bullet
missed
cochrane
by
fractions
of
an
inch
he
plunged
ahead
some
indefinite
time
later
babs
was
pulling
desperately
at
him
he
had
johnny
simms
on
the
floor
and
was
throttling
him
johnny
simms
strangled
and
tore
at
his
fingers
sanity
came
back
to
cochrane
with
the
effect
of
something
snapping
he
got
up
he
nodded
to
babs
and
she
picked
up
the
gun
johnny
simms
had
used
i
think
said
cochrane
breathing
hard
that
you
a
good
sample
of
everything
i
dislike
the
worst
thing
you
do
is
make
me
act
like
you
if
you
touch
a
gun
again
on
this
ship
i
probably
kill
you
if
you
get
arrogant
again
i
will
beat
the
living
daylights
out
of
you
get
up
johnny
simms
got
up
he
looked
thoroughly
scared
then
amazingly
he
beamed
at
cochrane
he
said
amiably
i
forgot
i
that
way
alicia
tell
you
i
do
blame
you
for
getting
mad
i
sorry
but
i
that
way
he
brushed
himself
off
beaming
at
alicia
and
jamison
and
babs
and
cochrane
cochrane
ground
his
teeth
he
went
to
the
airlock
and
looked
down
outside
holden
was
bent
over
the
creature
johnny
simms
had
killed
he
straightened
up
and
came
back
toward
the
ship
he
went
faster
when
the
ground
grew
hot
under
his
feet
he
fairly
leaped
into
the
and
started
it
up
not
human
he
reported
to
cochrane
when
he
slipped
from
the
sling
in
the
airlock
there
no
question
about
it
when
you
are
close
it
more
nearly
a
bird
than
anything
else
it
was
it
has
a
beak
there
are
penguins
on
earth
that
have
been
mistaken
for
men
i
did
a
show
once
said
cochrane
coldly
that
had
clips
of
old
films
of
cockfighting
in
it
there
was
a
kind
of
gamecock
called
cornish
game
that
was
fairly
manshaped
if
it
had
been
big
enough
pull
in
the
sling
and
close
the
lock
we
moving
he
turned
away
babs
stood
by
alicia
offering
a
handkerchief
for
alicia
to
put
to
her
cheek
jamison
listened
unhappily
as
johnny
simms
explained
brightly
that
he
had
always
been
that
way
when
he
got
excited
he
did
realize
what
he
was
doing
he
said
almost
with
pride
that
he
had
ever
been
any
other
way
than
that
he
did
really
mean
to
kill
anybody
but
when
he
got
excited
what
happened
demanded
holden
our
little
psychopath
said
cochrane
in
a
grating
voice
put
on
an
act
he
threatened
me
with
a
rifle
he
hit
alicia
first
jamison
trace
that
see
if
it
got
through
to
the
skin
of
the
ship
he
started
for
the
stairs
again
then
he
was
startled
by
the
frozen
immobility
of
holden
holden
face
was
deadly
his
hands
were
clenched
johnny
simms
said
with
a
fine
boyish
frankness
i
sorry
cochrane
no
hard
feelings
yes
cochrane
snapped
hard
feelings
i
got
them
he
took
holden
arm
he
steered
him
up
the
steps
holden
resisted
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
and
cochrane
gripped
his
arm
tighter
he
got
him
up
to
the
deck
above
if
i
been
here
said
holden
unsteadily
i
have
killed
him
if
he
hit
alicia
psychopath
or
no
psychopath
shut
up
said
cochrane
firmly
he
shot
at
me
and
in
my
small
way
a
psychopath
too
bill
my
psychosis
is
that
i
do
like
his
kind
of
psychosis
i
am
psychotically
devoted
to
sense
and
my
possibly
quaint
idea
of
decency
i
am
abnormally
concerned
with
the
real
world
and
you
better
come
back
to
it
look
here
i
pathologically
in
revolt
against
such
imbecilities
as
an
overcrowded
earth
and
people
being
afraid
of
their
jobs
and
people
going
crackpot
from
despair
you
want
me
to
get
cured
of
that
do
you
then
get
hold
of
yourself
bill
holden
swallowed
he
was
still
white
but
he
managed
to
grimace
you
right
lucky
i
was
outside
you
not
a
bad
psychologist
yourself
jed
i
better
said
cochrane
cynically
at
putting
on
shows
with
scrap
and
so
i
going
to
look
at
the
films
bell
took
as
we
landed
on
this
planet
and
work
out
some
ideas
for
broadcasts
he
went
up
another
flight
and
holden
went
with
him
in
a
sort
of
stilly
unnatural
calm
cochrane
ran
the
through
the
reversed
camera
for
examination
outside
there
waved
long
green
tresses
of
extraordinarily
elongated
leaves
the
patches
of
stuff
stirred
in
the
breeze
jamison
appeared
in
the
he
began
to
question
holden
hopefully
about
the
outside
it
was
not
grass
it
was
there
would
be
jamison
decided
happily
an
infinitude
of
forms
of
life
they
would
most
likely
be
insects
and
there
would
be
carnivorous
other
insects
to
prey
upon
them
some
species
would
find
it
advantageous
to
be
burrowing
insects
there
must
be
other
kinds
of
birds
than
the
giant
specimens
that
looked
like
men
at
a
distance
too
on
the
glacier
planet
there
had
been
few
birds
but
many
furry
creatures
possibly
the
situation
was
reversed
here
though
of
course
it
need
not
be
hm
said
cochrane
when
the
films
were
all
run
through
and
land
and
seas
plenty
of
green
vegetation
so
presumably
the
air
is
normal
for
humans
since
you
alive
holden
we
can
assume
it
instantly
fatal
ca
we
the
gravity
tolerable
a
little
on
the
light
side
maybe
compared
to
the
glacier
planet
he
was
silent
staring
at
the
blank
wall
of
the
he
frowned
suddenly
he
said
does
anybody
back
on
earth
know
that
babs
and
i
were
castaways
no
said
holden
still
very
quiet
indeed
alicia
ran
the
she
told
everybody
you
were
too
busy
to
be
called
to
the
communicator
it
was
queer
with
you
away
jamison
and
bell
tied
themselves
in
chairs
and
spliced
tape
johnny
of
course
his
voice
was
very
carefully
toneless
would
do
anything
useful
i
was
a
lot
of
the
time
but
i
did
help
alicia
figure
out
what
to
say
on
the
communicator
there
must
be
hundreds
of
calls
backed
up
for
you
to
take
good
said
cochrane
i
go
take
some
of
them
jones
could
we
make
a
flit
to
somewhere
else
on
this
planet
jones
said
negligently
i
told
you
we
got
fuel
to
reach
the
milky
way
where
do
you
want
to
go
anywhere
said
cochrane
the
scenery
is
dramatic
enough
here
for
a
new
broadcast
we
got
to
have
some
lurid
stuff
for
our
next
show
things
are
shaping
up
except
for
the
need
of
just
the
right
scenery
to
send
back
to
earth
what
kind
of
scenery
do
you
want
animals
preferred
said
cochrane
dinosaurs
would
do
or
buffalo
or
a
reasonable
facsimile
what
i
actually
like
more
than
anything
else
would
really
be
a
herd
of
buffalo
jamison
gasped
buffalo
meat
said
cochrane
in
an
explanatory
tone
on
the
hoof
the
job
all
this
has
turned
into
demands
a
careful
stimulation
of
all
the
basic
urges
so
i
want
people
to
think
of
steaks
and
chops
and
roasts
if
i
could
get
herds
of
animals
from
one
horizon
to
another
coming
up
said
jones
negligently
i
call
you
cochrane
did
not
believe
him
he
went
down
to
the
communicator
again
he
prepared
to
take
the
calls
from
earth
that
had
been
backed
up
behind
the
emergency
demand
for
an
immediate
that
he
met
while
the
ship
came
to
its
landing
there
was
an
enormous
amount
of
business
piled
up
and
it
was
slow
work
handling
it
his
voice
took
six
seconds
to
pass
through
something
over
two
hundred
of
space
in
the
dabney
field
and
then
two
seconds
in
normal
space
from
the
relay
in
lunar
city
it
was
twelve
seconds
between
the
time
he
finished
saying
something
before
the
first
word
of
the
reply
reached
him
it
was
very
slow
communication
he
reflected
annoyedly
that
he
have
to
ask
jones
to
make
a
special
dabney
field
communication
field
as
strong
as
was
necessary
to
take
care
of
the
situation
the
rockets
growled
and
roared
outside
the
ship
lifted
johnny
simms
came
storming
up
from
below
my
trophy
he
cried
indignantly
i
want
my
trophy
cochrane
looked
up
impatiently
from
the
screen
what
trophy
the
thing
i
shot
cried
johnny
simms
fiercely
i
want
to
have
it
mounted
nobody
else
ever
killed
anything
like
that
i
want
it
the
ship
surged
upward
more
strongly
cochrane
said
coldly
it
too
late
now
get
out
i
busy
he
returned
his
eyes
to
the
screen
johnny
simms
raced
for
the
stairs
a
little
later
cochrane
heard
shoutings
in
the
but
he
was
too
busy
to
inquire
the
ship
drifted
with
all
the
queasy
sensation
of
and
lifted
again
and
then
there
was
a
fairly
long
period
of
weightlessness
at
such
times
holden
would
be
greenish
and
sick
and
tormented
by
which
might
be
good
for
him
at
this
particular
time
for
a
long
time
it
seemed
there
were
alternating
periods
of
lift
and
free
fall
which
in
themselves
were
disturbing
once
the
free
fall
lasted
until
cochrane
began
to
feel
uneasy
but
then
the
rockets
roared
once
more
and
boomed
loudly
as
if
the
ship
were
leaving
the
planet
altogether
but
cochrane
was
talking
business
in
part
he
bluffed
in
part
quite
automatically
he
demanded
much
more
than
he
expected
to
get
simply
because
it
is
the
custom
in
business
not
to
be
frank
about
anything
whatever
he
asked
the
other
man
would
offer
less
so
he
asked
too
much
and
the
other
man
offered
too
little
each
knowing
in
advance
very
nearly
on
what
terms
they
would
finally
settle
considering
the
cost
of
time
to
lunar
city
not
to
mention
the
extension
to
the
stars
it
was
absurd
but
it
was
the
way
business
is
done
presently
cochrane
called
babs
and
alicia
and
had
them
witness
a
tentative
agreement
which
had
to
be
ratified
by
a
board
of
directors
of
a
corporation
back
on
earth
that
board
would
jump
at
it
but
the
stipulation
for
possible
cancellation
had
to
be
made
it
was
cochrane
felt
satisfyingly
competent
at
handling
it
while
the
formalities
were
in
progress
the
ship
surged
and
fell
and
swayed
and
surged
again
cochrane
said
ruefully
i
hate
to
ask
you
to
work
under
conditions
like
this
babs
babs
grinned
he
flushed
a
little
i
know
when
you
were
working
for
me
i
was
considerate
who
am
i
working
for
now
us
said
cochrane
then
he
looked
guiltily
at
alicia
he
felt
embarrassment
at
having
said
anything
in
the
least
sentimental
before
her
considering
johnny
simms
it
was
not
too
tactful
her
cheek
where
it
had
been
red
now
showed
a
distinct
bruise
he
said
sorry
alicia
about
johnny
i
got
into
it
myself
said
alicia
i
loved
him
he
is
really
bad
if
you
want
to
know
i
think
he
simply
decided
years
ago
that
he
would
grow
up
past
the
age
of
six
he
was
a
rich
man
spoiled
little
boy
it
was
fun
so
he
made
a
career
of
it
his
family
let
him
i
she
smiled
faintly
i
making
a
career
of
taking
care
of
him
something
can
be
done
even
with
a
growled
cochrane
holden
but
he
would
be
the
best
one
to
try
he
definitely
would
be
the
best
one
to
try
said
alicia
very
quietly
cochrane
turned
away
she
knew
how
bill
holden
felt
which
might
or
might
not
be
comforting
to
him
the
communicator
again
the
pictures
of
furry
bipeds
on
the
glacier
planet
had
made
a
sensation
on
television
a
wanted
the
right
to
make
toys
like
them
the
pictures
were
copyrighted
cochrane
made
the
deal
there
would
be
miniature
animals
on
sale
in
all
within
days
spaceways
would
collect
a
royalty
on
each
toy
sold
the
rockets
boomed
and
lessened
their
noise
and
wavered
up
and
down
again
then
there
was
that
deliberate
crunching
feel
of
the
great
pressing
into
soil
with
all
the
ship
weight
bearing
down
the
rockets
ran
on
drumming
for
a
little
longer
then
they
cut
off
we
landed
again
let
see
where
we
are
they
went
up
to
the
johnny
simms
stood
against
the
wall
sulking
he
had
managed
his
life
very
successfully
by
acting
like
a
spoiled
little
boy
now
he
had
lost
any
idea
of
saner
conduct
at
the
moment
he
looked
ridiculous
but
alicia
had
a
bruised
cheek
and
cochrane
could
have
been
killed
and
holden
had
been
in
danger
because
johnny
simms
wanted
to
and
insisted
on
acting
like
a
rich
man
spoiled
little
boy
it
occurred
to
cochrane
that
alicia
would
probably
find
recompense
for
her
humiliation
and
pain
in
the
penitence
exactly
as
temporary
as
any
other
emotion
when
she
and
johnny
simms
were
alone
together
the
ship
had
come
down
close
to
the
of
the
planet
away
to
the
west
there
was
the
glint
of
blue
sea
dusk
was
already
descending
here
there
were
smoothly
contoured
hills
in
view
and
there
was
a
dark
patch
of
forest
on
one
hilltop
and
the
trees
at
the
woodland
edge
had
the
same
drooping
foliage
of
the
trees
first
seen
but
there
were
larger
and
more
solid
giants
among
them
the
ship
had
landed
on
a
small
plateau
and
downhill
from
it
a
spring
gushed
out
with
such
force
that
the
was
rounded
by
pressure
from
below
the
water
overflowed
and
went
down
toward
the
sea
i
think
we
all
right
said
al
the
pilot
but
he
stayed
in
his
seat
in
case
the
ship
threatened
to
sway
over
cochrane
inspected
the
outer
world
well
we
sighted
what
i
think
you
want
said
jones
he
looked
and
yet
secretly
complacent
just
watch
the
dusk
grew
deeper
colorings
appeared
in
the
west
they
were
very
similar
to
the
on
earth
not
many
volcanoes
here
the
amount
of
dust
was
limited
as
on
earth
a
great
star
winked
into
view
in
the
east
it
was
as
bright
as
venus
seen
from
earth
it
had
a
disk
close
to
it
infinitely
small
there
was
a
speck
of
light
which
seemed
somehow
like
a
star
cochrane
squinted
at
it
he
thought
of
the
great
world
he
seen
out
a
port
on
the
way
here
it
had
an
attendant
which
itself
had
icecaps
and
seas
and
continents
he
called
jamison
i
think
that
the
planet
agreed
jamison
we
passed
close
by
it
we
saw
it
it
had
a
moon
observed
cochrane
a
big
one
it
looked
like
a
world
itself
what
would
it
be
like
there
cooler
than
this
said
jamison
promptly
because
it
farther
from
the
sun
but
it
might
pick
up
some
heat
from
reflection
from
its
primary
white
clouds
it
would
be
a
fair
world
it
has
oceans
and
continents
and
strings
of
islands
but
its
sea
is
strange
and
dark
and
restless
gigantic
tides
surge
in
its
depths
drawn
by
the
planetary
colossus
about
which
it
swings
its
animal
life
cut
said
cochrane
dryly
what
do
you
really
think
could
it
be
another
inhabitable
world
for
people
to
move
to
jamison
looked
annoyed
at
having
been
cut
off
probably
he
said
more
prosaically
the
tides
would
be
monstrous
though
might
be
used
for
power
said
cochrane
we
see
then
jones
spoke
with
elaborate
casualness
here
something
to
look
at
on
the
ground
cochrane
moved
to
see
the
dusk
had
deepened
still
more
the
smooth
ground
had
become
a
dark
olive
where
bare
hillsides
gave
upon
the
sky
there
were
dark
masses
flowing
slowly
forward
the
edges
of
the
hills
turned
black
and
the
blackness
moved
down
their
nearer
slopes
it
was
not
an
even
front
of
darkness
there
were
patches
which
preceded
the
others
they
did
not
stay
distinct
they
merged
with
the
masses
which
followed
them
and
other
patches
separated
in
their
places
all
of
the
darkness
moved
without
haste
with
a
sort
of
inexorable
deliberation
it
moved
toward
the
ship
and
the
valley
and
the
gushing
fountain
and
the
stream
which
flowed
from
it
what
on
earth
began
cochrane
you
not
on
earth
said
jones
chidingly
al
and
i
found
you
asked
for
buffalo
or
a
reasonable
facsimile
i
wo
guarantee
anything
but
we
spotted
what
looked
like
herds
of
beasts
moving
over
the
green
plains
inland
we
checked
and
they
seemed
to
be
moving
in
this
direction
once
we
dropped
down
low
and
bell
got
some
pictures
when
he
enlarged
them
we
decided
they
do
so
we
lined
up
where
they
were
all
headed
for
and
here
we
are
and
here
they
are
cochrane
stared
with
all
his
eyes
behind
him
he
heard
bell
fuming
to
himself
as
he
tried
to
adjust
a
camera
for
pictures
in
the
little
remaining
light
babs
stood
beside
cochrane
staring
incredulously
the
darkness
was
beasts
they
blackened
the
hillsides
on
three
sides
of
the
ship
they
came
deliberately
leisurely
onward
they
were
literally
uncountable
they
were
as
numerous
as
the
buffalo
that
formerly
thronged
the
western
plains
of
america
in
black
shaggy
masses
they
came
toward
the
spring
and
its
stream
nearby
their
heads
could
be
distinguished
and
all
of
this
was
perfectly
natural
the
cosmos
is
one
thing
where
life
exists
its
living
creatures
will
fit
themselves
cunningly
into
each
niche
where
life
can
be
maintained
on
vast
green
plains
there
will
be
animals
to
graze
and
there
will
be
animals
to
prey
on
them
so
the
grazing
things
will
band
together
in
herds
for
and
reproduction
and
where
the
ground
is
covered
with
plants
such
plants
will
shelter
innumerable
tiny
creatures
and
some
of
them
will
be
burrowers
so
rain
will
drain
quickly
into
those
burrowings
and
not
make
streams
and
therefore
the
drainage
will
reappear
as
springs
and
the
grazing
animals
will
go
to
those
springs
to
drink
often
they
will
gather
more
densely
at
nightfall
for
greater
protection
from
their
enemies
they
will
even
often
gather
at
the
springs
or
their
overflowing
brooks
this
will
happen
anywhere
that
plains
and
animals
exist
on
any
planet
to
the
edge
of
the
galaxy
because
there
are
laws
for
living
things
as
well
as
stones
great
dark
masses
of
the
beasts
moved
unhurriedly
past
the
ship
they
were
roughly
the
size
of
cattle
which
itself
would
be
determined
by
the
gravity
of
the
planet
setting
a
maximum
favorable
size
for
grazing
beasts
with
an
ample
there
were
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
them
visible
in
the
deepening
night
they
crowded
to
the
gushing
spring
and
to
the
stream
that
flowed
from
it
they
drank
sometimes
groups
of
them
waited
patiently
until
the
way
to
the
water
was
clear
well
said
jones
i
think
you
filled
my
order
admitted
cochrane
the
night
became
starlight
only
and
cochrane
impatiently
demanded
of
al
or
somebody
that
they
measure
the
length
of
a
complete
day
and
night
on
this
planet
the
stars
would
move
overhead
at
a
rate
so
many
degrees
in
so
much
time
he
needed
said
cochrane
as
if
this
order
also
could
be
filled
a
not
more
than
six
hours
shorter
or
longer
than
an
jones
and
al
conferred
and
prepared
to
take
some
sort
of
reading
without
any
suitable
instrument
cochrane
moved
restlessly
about
he
did
not
notice
johnny
simms
johnny
had
stood
sullenly
in
his
place
not
moving
to
look
out
the
windows
ostentatiously
ignoring
everything
and
everybody
and
nobody
paid
attention
it
was
not
a
matter
to
offend
an
adult
but
it
was
very
shocking
indeed
to
a
rich
man
son
who
had
been
able
to
make
a
career
of
staying
emotionally
at
a
level
cochrane
thoughts
were
almost
feverish
if
the
here
was
suitable
all
his
planning
was
successful
if
it
was
too
long
or
too
short
he
had
grimly
to
look
further
and
spaceways
would
still
not
be
as
completely
a
success
as
he
wanted
it
would
have
been
much
simpler
to
have
measured
the
apparent
size
of
the
local
sun
by
any
means
available
and
then
simply
to
have
timed
the
intervals
between
its
touching
of
the
horizon
and
its
complete
setting
but
cochrane
thought
of
it
at
sunset
presently
he
wandered
down
to
where
babs
and
alicia
worked
in
the
kitchen
to
prepare
a
meal
he
tried
to
help
the
atmosphere
was
much
more
like
that
in
a
small
apartment
back
home
than
on
a
among
the
stars
this
was
not
in
any
way
such
a
journey
of
exploration
as
the
writers
of
fiction
had
imagined
jamison
came
down
presently
and
offered
to
prepare
some
special
dish
in
which
he
claimed
to
excel
there
was
no
mention
of
johnny
simms
alicia
elaborately
ignoring
all
that
was
past
told
jamison
that
babs
and
cochrane
were
now
an
acknowledged
romance
and
actually
had
plans
for
marriage
immediately
the
ship
returned
to
earth
jamison
made
the
usual
inept
jests
suited
to
such
an
occasion
presently
they
called
the
others
to
dinner
jones
and
johnny
simms
were
long
behind
the
others
and
jones
expression
was
conspicuously
johnny
simms
looked
sulkily
rebellious
his
sulking
had
not
attracted
attention
in
the
he
had
meant
to
refuse
sulkily
to
come
to
dinner
but
jones
would
trust
him
alone
in
the
now
he
sat
down
scowling
and
ostentatiously
refused
to
eat
despite
alicia
coaxing
he
snarled
at
her
this
also
was
not
in
the
tradition
of
the
behavior
of
voyagers
of
space
they
dined
in
the
saloon
of
a
ship
that
had
never
been
meant
really
to
leave
the
moon
the
ship
stood
upright
under
strange
stars
upon
a
stranger
world
and
all
about
it
outside
there
were
the
resting
forms
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
creatures
like
cattle
and
the
conversation
was
partly
jests
about
and
cochrane
new
romantic
status
and
partly
about
a
television
broadcast
which
had
to
be
ready
for
a
certain
number
of
yet
ahead
and
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
johnny
simms
glowering
at
the
table
and
refusing
to
eat
it
was
a
mistake
probably
much
much
later
cochrane
and
babs
were
again
in
the
and
this
time
they
were
alone
look
said
cochrane
vexedly
do
you
realize
that
i
have
kissed
you
since
we
got
back
on
the
ship
what
happened
you
said
babs
indignantly
you
been
thinking
about
something
else
every
second
of
the
time
cochrane
did
not
think
about
anything
else
for
several
minutes
he
began
to
recall
with
new
tolerance
the
insane
antics
of
people
he
had
been
producing
shows
about
they
had
reason
those
imaginary
people
to
act
unreasonably
but
presently
his
mind
was
working
again
we
got
to
make
some
plans
for
ourselves
he
said
we
can
live
back
on
earth
of
course
we
already
made
a
neat
sum
out
of
the
broadcasts
from
this
trip
but
i
do
think
we
want
to
live
the
way
one
has
to
live
on
earth
with
too
many
people
there
i
like
somebody
came
clattering
up
the
stairs
from
below
johnny
it
was
bell
is
he
up
here
cochrane
released
babs
no
he
not
here
why
he
missing
said
bell
apprehensively
alicia
says
he
took
a
gun
a
gun
gone
anyhow
he
vanished
cochrane
swore
under
his
breath
a
fool
asserting
his
dignity
with
a
gun
could
be
a
serious
matter
indeed
he
switched
on
the
lights
he
was
not
there
they
went
down
and
hunted
over
the
main
saloon
he
was
not
there
then
holden
called
harshly
from
the
next
deck
down
there
was
alicia
by
the
inner
airlock
door
her
face
was
deathly
pale
she
had
opened
the
door
the
outer
door
was
open
too
and
it
had
not
been
opened
since
this
last
landing
by
anybody
else
the
cables
were
run
out
they
swung
slowly
in
the
light
that
fell
upon
them
from
the
inside
of
the
ship
a
smell
came
in
the
opening
it
was
the
smell
of
beasts
it
was
a
musky
ammoniacal
smell
somehow
not
alien
even
though
it
was
unfamiliar
there
were
noises
outside
in
the
night
grunting
sounds
snortings
there
were
such
sounds
as
a
vast
concourse
of
grazing
creatures
would
make
in
the
when
gathered
by
thousands
and
myriads
for
safety
and
for
rest
he
went
out
said
alicia
desperately
he
meant
to
punish
us
he
a
spoiled
little
boy
we
were
nice
to
him
and
he
was
afraid
of
us
too
so
he
ran
away
to
make
us
sorry
cochrane
went
to
look
out
of
the
lock
and
to
call
johnny
simms
back
he
gazed
into
absolute
blackness
on
the
ground
he
felt
a
queasy
giddiness
because
there
was
no
at
the
outer
lock
door
and
he
knew
the
depth
of
the
fall
outside
he
raged
within
himself
johnny
simms
would
feel
triumphant
when
he
was
called
he
would
require
to
be
pleaded
with
to
return
he
would
pompously
set
terms
for
returning
before
he
was
killed
cochrane
saw
a
flash
of
fire
and
the
short
streak
of
a
patch
before
it
hit
something
he
heard
the
report
of
the
gun
he
heard
a
bellow
of
agony
and
then
a
scream
of
purest
terror
from
johnny
simms
then
from
the
ground
arose
a
truly
monstrous
tumult
every
one
of
the
creatures
below
raised
its
voice
in
a
horrible
bleating
cry
the
volume
of
sound
was
numbing
was
agonizing
in
sheer
impact
there
were
stirrings
and
clickings
as
of
horns
clashing
against
each
other
another
scream
from
johnny
simms
he
had
moved
it
appeared
that
he
was
running
cochrane
saw
more
there
were
more
shots
he
clenched
his
hands
and
waited
for
the
thunderous
vibration
that
would
be
all
this
multitude
of
animals
pounding
through
the
night
in
blind
stampede
it
did
not
come
there
was
only
that
bleating
horrible
outcry
as
all
the
beasts
bellowed
of
alarm
and
created
this
noise
to
frighten
their
assailants
away
twice
more
there
were
shots
in
the
night
johnny
simms
fired
crazily
and
screamed
in
hysterical
panic
each
time
the
shots
and
screaming
were
farther
away
there
were
no
portable
lights
with
which
to
make
a
search
it
was
unthinkable
to
go
blundering
among
the
beasts
in
darkness
there
was
nothing
to
do
cochrane
could
only
watch
and
listen
helplessly
while
the
strong
rose
to
his
nostrils
and
the
innumerable
noises
of
unseen
uneasy
creatures
sounded
in
his
ears
inside
the
ship
alicia
wept
hopelessly
babs
tried
in
vain
to
comfort
her
chapter
ten
the
sun
rose
cochrane
noted
the
time
it
was
fourteen
hours
since
sunset
the
local
day
would
be
something
more
than
an
in
length
the
manner
of
sunrise
was
familiar
there
was
a
pale
gray
light
in
the
sky
it
strengthened
then
reddish
colors
appeared
and
changed
to
gold
and
the
unnamed
stars
winked
out
one
after
another
presently
the
nearer
hillsides
ceased
to
be
black
there
was
light
everywhere
alicia
white
and
haggard
waited
to
see
what
the
light
would
show
but
there
was
heavy
mist
everywhere
the
were
clear
and
the
edge
of
the
visible
woodland
and
the
top
half
of
the
ship
shining
hull
rose
clear
of
slowly
writhing
fog
but
everything
else
seemed
submerged
in
a
sea
of
milk
but
the
mist
grew
thinner
as
the
sun
shone
on
it
its
top
writhed
to
nothingness
all
this
was
wholly
commonplace
even
clouds
in
the
sky
were
of
types
enough
which
was
when
one
thought
about
it
inevitable
this
was
a
sun
of
the
same
kind
and
color
as
the
star
which
warmed
the
planet
earth
it
had
planets
like
the
sun
of
men
home
world
there
was
a
law
bode
law
which
specified
that
planets
must
float
in
orbits
bearing
relationships
to
each
other
there
must
also
be
a
law
that
planets
in
those
orbits
must
bear
relationships
of
size
to
each
other
there
must
be
a
law
that
winds
must
blow
under
ordinary
conditions
and
clouds
form
at
appointed
heights
and
times
it
would
be
very
remarkable
if
earth
were
an
exception
to
natural
laws
that
other
worlds
obey
so
the
strangeness
of
the
morning
to
those
who
watched
from
the
ship
was
more
like
the
strangeness
of
an
alien
land
on
earth
than
that
of
a
wholly
alien
planet
the
lower
dawnmist
thinned
gazing
down
cochrane
saw
dark
masses
moving
slowly
past
the
ship
three
metal
they
were
the
beasts
of
the
night
moving
deliberately
from
their
to
the
vast
plains
inland
there
were
bunches
of
hundreds
and
bunches
of
scores
there
were
occasional
knots
of
dozens
only
from
overhead
and
through
the
mist
cochrane
could
not
see
individual
animals
too
clearly
but
they
were
heavy
beasts
and
clumsy
ones
they
moved
sluggishly
their
numbers
dwindled
he
saw
groups
of
no
more
than
four
or
five
he
saw
single
animals
trudging
patiently
away
he
saw
no
more
at
all
then
the
sunlight
touched
the
inland
hills
the
last
of
the
morning
mist
dissolved
and
there
were
the
dead
bodies
of
two
beasts
near
the
base
of
the
ship
johnny
simms
had
killed
them
with
his
first
panicky
shots
of
the
night
there
was
another
dead
beast
a
away
cochrane
gave
orders
jones
and
al
could
not
leave
the
ship
they
were
needed
to
get
it
back
to
earth
with
full
knowledge
of
how
to
make
other
starships
cochrane
tried
to
leave
babs
behind
but
she
would
not
stay
bell
had
loaded
himself
with
a
camera
and
besides
a
weapon
before
cochrane
even
began
his
organization
holden
was
needed
for
an
extra
gun
alicia
tearless
and
despairing
would
not
be
left
behind
cochrane
turned
wryly
to
jamison
i
do
think
johnny
was
killed
he
said
he
gotten
a
long
way
off
before
it
happened
anyhow
we
got
to
hunt
for
him
with
beasts
like
those
of
last
night
there
naturally
be
other
creatures
to
prey
on
them
we
might
run
into
anything
if
we
do
get
back
you
get
to
the
lawyers
i
had
representing
spaceways
they
get
rich
off
the
job
but
you
end
up
rich
too
the
best
bet
all
around
said
jamison
in
a
low
tone
would
be
to
find
him
trampled
to
death
i
agree
said
cochrane
sourly
but
apparently
the
beasts
stampede
maybe
they
do
even
charge
but
just
form
rings
to
protect
their
females
and
young
like
i
afraid
he
alive
but
also
afraid
we
never
find
him
he
marshaled
his
group
jones
had
ready
deftly
removed
for
the
purpose
from
nobody
had
used
since
leaving
lunar
city
and
holden
took
one
to
keep
in
touch
by
they
went
down
in
the
sling
two
at
a
time
cochrane
regarded
the
two
dead
animals
near
the
base
of
the
ship
they
were
roughly
the
size
of
cattle
and
they
were
shaggy
like
buffalo
they
had
branching
pointed
deadly
horns
they
had
hoofs
single
hoofs
not
cloven
they
were
not
like
any
earth
animal
but
horns
and
hoofs
will
appear
in
any
system
of
parallel
evolution
it
would
seem
even
more
certain
that
proteins
and
amino
acids
and
such
compounds
as
hemoglobin
and
fat
and
should
be
identical
as
a
matter
of
chemical
inevitability
these
creatures
had
teeth
and
they
were
herbivorous
bell
photographed
them
painstakingly
somehow
said
cochrane
i
think
they
be
wholesome
food
if
we
can
we
empty
a
and
take
a
carcass
for
tests
holden
fingered
his
rifle
unhappily
alicia
said
nothing
babs
stayed
close
beside
her
they
went
on
they
came
to
another
dead
animal
a
away
the
ground
was
full
of
the
scent
and
the
hoofmarks
of
the
departed
herd
bell
photographed
again
they
did
not
stop
johnny
simms
had
been
this
way
because
of
the
carcass
he
was
here
now
they
topped
the
next
rise
in
the
ground
they
saw
two
other
slaughtered
creatures
it
was
wholly
evident
now
that
these
animals
did
not
charge
but
only
stood
their
ground
when
alarmed
johnny
simms
had
fired
blindly
when
he
blundered
into
their
groupings
the
last
carcass
they
saw
was
barely
two
hundred
yards
from
the
one
patch
of
woodland
visible
from
the
ship
cochrane
said
with
some
grimness
if
his
eyes
had
gotten
used
to
the
darkness
he
might
have
seen
the
forest
and
tried
to
get
into
it
to
get
away
from
those
animals
and
if
johnny
simms
had
not
stopped
short
instantly
he
reached
the
woods
and
presumable
safety
he
would
be
utterly
lost
by
now
there
could
be
nothing
less
hopeful
than
the
situation
of
a
man
lost
on
a
strange
planet
not
knowing
in
what
direction
he
had
blundered
on
his
first
starting
out
even
nearby
three
directions
out
of
four
would
be
wrong
farther
away
the
chance
of
stumbling
on
the
way
back
to
the
ship
would
be
nonexistent
alicia
saw
a
human
footprint
on
the
trodden
muck
near
the
last
carcass
it
pointed
toward
the
wood
they
reached
the
wood
and
search
looked
hopeless
then
by
purest
chance
they
found
a
place
where
johnny
had
stumbled
and
fallen
headlong
leaped
up
and
fled
crazily
for
some
fifteen
yards
they
could
track
him
by
the
trampled
dried
small
growths
he
knocked
down
in
his
flight
then
there
were
no
more
such
growths
all
signs
of
his
flight
were
lost
but
they
went
on
there
were
strangenesses
everywhere
of
which
they
could
realize
only
a
small
part
because
they
had
been
back
on
earth
there
was
one
place
where
trees
grew
like
banyans
and
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
penetrate
them
they
swerved
aside
there
was
another
spot
where
giant
trees
like
sequoias
made
a
atmosphere
and
it
seemed
an
impiety
to
speak
but
holden
reported
tonelessly
in
the
and
assured
jones
and
al
and
jamison
that
all
so
far
was
well
they
heard
a
vast
commotion
of
chattering
voices
and
they
hoped
that
it
might
be
a
disturbance
of
johnny
simms
causing
but
when
they
reached
the
place
there
was
dead
silence
only
there
were
hundreds
of
tiny
nests
everywhere
they
could
not
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
single
one
of
the
nests
inhabitants
but
they
felt
that
they
were
peeked
at
from
under
leaves
and
around
branches
cochrane
looked
unhappy
indeed
in
cold
blood
he
knew
that
johnny
simms
had
left
the
ship
in
exactly
the
sort
of
resentful
bravado
with
which
a
spoiled
little
boy
will
run
away
from
home
to
punish
his
parents
quite
possibly
he
had
intended
only
to
go
out
into
the
night
and
wait
near
the
ship
until
he
was
missed
but
he
found
himself
among
the
unknown
beasts
he
gone
into
blind
panic
now
he
was
lost
indeed
but
one
could
not
refuse
to
search
for
him
simply
because
it
was
hopeless
cochrane
could
not
imagine
doing
any
less
than
continuing
to
search
as
long
as
alicia
had
hope
she
might
hope
on
indefinitely
they
heard
the
faint
distant
incisive
sound
of
a
shot
holden
voice
reported
it
in
the
cochrane
nodded
brightly
to
alicia
and
fired
a
shot
in
turn
he
was
relieved
it
looked
like
everything
would
end
in
a
commonplace
fashion
the
party
from
the
ship
headed
toward
the
source
of
the
other
sound
in
half
an
hour
cochrane
was
about
to
fire
again
but
they
heard
the
hysterical
of
firing
it
seemed
no
nearer
but
it
could
only
be
johnny
simms
cochrane
and
holden
fired
together
for
assurance
to
johnny
bell
took
pictures
again
they
marched
toward
where
the
shots
had
been
fired
again
they
trudged
on
for
a
long
time
seemingly
johnny
had
moved
away
from
them
as
they
followed
him
they
breasted
a
hill
and
there
was
a
breeze
with
the
smell
of
water
in
it
and
they
saw
that
here
the
land
sloped
very
gradually
toward
the
sea
and
the
sea
was
in
view
it
was
infinitely
blue
and
it
reached
toward
the
most
alluring
of
horizons
between
them
and
the
sea
there
was
only
stuff
brownish
and
sparse
there
was
sand
underfoot
a
curious
bluish
sand
only
here
and
there
did
the
vegetation
grow
higher
than
their
heads
more
shots
between
them
and
the
sea
cochrane
and
holden
fired
again
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
the
fool
demanded
holden
irritably
he
knows
we
coming
why
does
he
stand
still
or
come
to
meet
us
cochrane
shrugged
that
thought
was
disturbing
him
too
they
pressed
forward
and
suddenly
holden
exclaimed
that
looks
like
a
man
two
men
cochrane
caught
the
barest
glimpse
of
something
running
about
far
ahead
it
looked
like
naked
human
flesh
it
was
the
size
of
a
man
it
vanished
another
popped
into
view
and
darted
madly
out
of
sight
they
did
not
see
the
newcomers
he
shot
something
like
that
back
where
we
first
landed
said
cochrane
grimly
we
better
hurry
they
did
hurry
there
was
a
last
flurry
of
shooting
it
was
automatic
fire
it
is
not
wise
to
shoot
on
automatic
if
one
ammunition
is
limited
johnny
simms
firearm
chattered
furiously
for
part
of
a
second
it
stopped
short
he
could
have
fired
so
short
a
burst
he
was
out
of
bullets
they
ran
when
they
drew
near
him
a
hooting
set
up
things
scattered
away
large
things
birds
the
size
of
men
they
heard
johnny
simms
screaming
they
came
panting
to
the
very
beach
on
which
waves
broke
in
absolutely
normal
grandeur
the
sand
was
commonplace
save
for
a
slight
bluish
tint
johnny
simms
was
out
on
the
beach
in
the
open
he
was
down
he
had
flung
his
gun
at
something
and
was
weaponless
he
lay
on
the
sand
shrieking
there
were
four
ungainly
monstrous
birds
like
oversized
cornish
game
gamecocks
pecking
at
him
two
ran
crazily
away
at
sight
of
the
humans
two
others
remained
then
they
fled
one
of
them
halted
darted
back
and
took
a
last
peck
at
johnny
simms
before
it
fled
again
holden
fired
and
missed
cochrane
ran
toward
the
kicking
shrieking
johnny
simms
but
alicia
got
there
first
he
was
a
completely
pitiable
object
his
clothing
had
been
almost
completely
stripped
away
in
the
brief
time
since
his
last
burst
of
shots
there
were
wounds
on
his
bare
flesh
after
all
the
beak
of
a
bird
as
tall
as
a
man
is
not
a
weapon
to
be
despised
johnny
simms
would
have
been
pecked
to
death
but
for
the
party
from
the
ship
he
had
been
spotted
and
harried
by
a
huntingpack
of
the
creatures
at
earliest
dawn
a
man
would
have
stood
still
and
killed
some
of
them
then
the
rest
would
either
have
run
away
or
devoured
their
slaughtered
fellows
but
johnny
simms
was
not
he
had
made
a
career
of
being
a
rich
man
spoiled
little
boy
now
he
had
a
fright
great
enough
and
an
escape
narrow
enough
to
shatter
the
nerves
of
a
normal
man
to
johnny
simms
the
effect
was
catastrophic
he
could
not
walk
and
the
distance
was
too
great
to
carry
him
holden
reported
by
and
jones
proposed
to
butcher
one
of
the
animals
johnny
had
killed
and
put
it
in
a
freezer
emptied
for
the
purpose
and
then
lift
the
ship
and
land
by
the
sea
it
seemed
a
reasonable
proposal
johnny
was
surely
not
seriously
wounded
but
that
meant
time
to
wait
alicia
sat
by
her
husband
soothing
him
holden
moved
along
the
beach
examining
the
shells
that
had
come
ashore
he
picked
up
one
shell
more
glorious
in
its
coloring
than
any
of
the
creatures
of
earth
this
shell
grew
neither
in
the
flat
spiral
nor
the
form
of
earth
mollusks
it
grew
in
a
spiral
so
that
the
result
was
an
extraordinary
lustrous
complex
sphere
bell
fairly
danced
with
excitement
as
he
photographed
it
with
lavish
pains
to
get
all
the
colors
just
right
cochrane
and
babs
moved
along
the
beach
also
it
was
not
possible
to
be
apprehensive
cochrane
talked
largely
presently
he
was
saying
with
infinite
satisfaction
the
chemical
compounds
here
are
bound
to
be
the
same
it
a
new
world
bigger
than
the
glacier
planet
those
beasts
last
night
if
they
good
will
make
this
a
place
like
the
old
west
and
everybody
envies
the
pioneers
this
is
a
new
earth
everything
so
nearly
the
same
i
never
observed
babs
heard
of
blue
sand
on
earth
he
frowned
at
her
he
stooped
and
picked
up
a
handful
of
the
beach
stuff
it
was
not
blue
the
tiny
pebbles
were
ordinary
quartz
and
granite
rock
they
would
have
to
be
yet
there
was
a
blueness
the
blue
grains
were
very
much
smaller
than
the
white
and
tan
and
gray
ones
cochrane
looked
closely
then
he
blew
all
the
sand
blew
out
of
his
hand
except
at
last
one
tiny
grain
it
was
white
it
glittered
greasily
cochrane
moved
four
paces
and
wetted
his
hand
in
the
sea
he
tried
to
wet
the
it
would
not
wet
he
began
to
laugh
i
did
a
show
once
he
told
babs
about
the
old
ever
hear
of
them
they
used
to
find
diamonds
in
blue
clay
which
was
as
hard
as
rock
here
blue
clay
goes
out
from
the
land
to
under
the
waves
this
is
a
tiny
diamond
washed
out
by
the
sea
this
is
the
last
thing
we
need
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
we
due
on
the
air
in
two
hours
and
a
half
now
we
got
what
we
want
let
go
have
holden
tell
jones
to
hurry
but
babs
complained
suddenly
jed
what
sort
of
life
am
i
going
to
lead
with
you
here
we
are
and
nobody
can
see
us
and
you
do
even
notice
cochrane
was
penitent
in
fact
they
had
to
hurry
back
down
the
beach
to
join
the
others
when
the
appeared
as
a
silvery
gleam
high
in
the
air
and
then
came
swooping
down
with
fierce
flames
underneath
it
to
settle
a
inland
bell
had
a
picture
of
the
tiny
diamond
by
the
time
the
ground
was
cool
enough
for
them
to
the
ship
the
way
he
photographed
it
against
a
background
which
had
nothing
by
which
its
size
could
be
estimated
the
little
white
stone
looked
like
a
kohinoor
it
was
two
transparent
pyramids
set
base
to
base
and
he
even
got
from
it
and
jamison
forewarned
took
pictures
from
the
air
of
the
areas
they
showed
the
tint
the
one
tiny
diamond
explained
the
broadcast
was
highly
successful
it
began
with
a
commercial
in
which
the
evils
of
faulty
elimination
were
discussed
with
infinite
delicacy
and
it
was
clearly
proved
to
an
audience
waiting
to
look
beyond
the
stars
that
only
greshham
intestinal
emollient
allowed
the
body
to
make
full
use
of
vitamins
proteins
and
the
very
newest
enzymatic
which
everybody
needed
for
really
perfect
health
there
followed
the
approach
shots
to
this
planet
shots
of
the
great
on
the
plains
views
of
luxuriant
waving
foliage
the
tide
of
shaggy
animals
as
they
came
at
dusk
to
their
and
there
was
an
picturing
of
the
soil
which
the
last
of
all
declared
to
be
diamondiferous
cochrane
direction
of
this
show
was
almost
inspired
the
views
of
the
animal
herd
were
calculated
to
make
any
member
of
his
audience
think
in
simultaneous
terms
of
glamour
and
adventure
with
perfect
personal
safety
of
course
and
of
steaks
chops
and
roasts
the
more
gifted
viewers
back
on
earth
might
even
envision
filets
mignon
the
infinitesimal
diamond
with
its
prismatic
glitterings
of
course
roused
cupidity
of
another
sort
there
were
four
commercials
cut
into
these
alluring
views
the
last
was
superimposed
upon
a
view
bell
had
taken
of
the
and
it
might
have
seemed
that
the
television
audience
would
confuse
the
charm
of
the
new
world
as
pictured
with
the
product
insistently
praised
but
the
public
was
pretty
well
toughened
up
against
commercials
nowadays
it
was
not
deceived
as
usual
it
only
deceived
itself
but
there
was
no
deception
about
the
fact
that
there
was
a
new
and
unoccupied
planet
fit
for
human
habitation
that
was
true
and
the
fretting
overcrowded
cities
immediately
became
places
where
everybody
made
happy
plans
for
his
neighbor
to
move
there
but
the
more
irritable
people
would
begin
to
think
vaguely
that
it
might
be
worth
going
to
for
themselves
the
ship
took
off
two
hours
after
the
broadcast
part
of
that
time
was
taken
up
with
astrogational
conferences
with
astronomers
on
earth
cochrane
had
this
conference
taped
for
the
auxiliary
in
which
the
audience
shared
the
problems
as
well
as
the
triumphs
of
the
cochrane
wanted
to
get
back
to
earth
so
far
as
television
was
concerned
it
would
be
unwise
the
ship
and
its
crew
would
travel
indefinitely
without
a
lack
of
sponsors
but
for
once
cochrane
agreed
entirely
with
holden
we
heading
back
he
told
babs
because
if
we
keep
on
people
will
accept
our
shows
as
just
another
superior
kind
of
they
have
the
dream
quality
of
win
a
million
and
the
they
be
things
to
dream
about
but
never
to
think
of
doing
anything
about
we
going
to
make
the
series
disappointingly
short
in
order
to
make
it
more
convincingly
factual
we
wo
spin
it
out
for
its
until
it
practically
loses
everything
else
no
said
babs
she
put
her
hand
in
his
she
found
it
necessary
to
remind
him
now
and
then
so
the
ship
started
home
and
it
would
not
return
direct
to
earth
or
lunar
city
for
a
very
definite
reason
cochrane
meant
to
have
all
his
business
affairs
neatly
wrapped
up
before
landing
they
could
get
another
show
or
two
across
and
some
highly
involved
contracts
could
be
haggled
to
completion
more
smoothly
if
one
of
the
parties
spaceways
was
not
available
except
when
it
felt
like
being
available
the
other
parties
would
be
more
anxious
so
the
did
not
deal
with
a
direct
return
to
earth
but
with
a
small
star
not
too
far
out
of
the
direct
line
the
pole
star
could
have
been
visited
but
it
was
a
double
star
cochrane
had
no
abstract
scientific
curiosity
his
approach
was
strictly
that
of
a
man
of
business
he
did
the
business
there
was
of
course
a
suitable
pause
not
too
far
from
the
second
planet
the
planet
of
the
shaggy
beasts
they
put
out
a
plastic
balloon
with
a
dabney
field
generator
inside
it
it
would
float
in
emptiness
indefinitely
the
field
would
hold
for
not
less
than
twenty
years
it
would
serve
as
a
beacon
a
highway
a
railroad
track
through
space
for
other
ships
planning
to
visit
the
third
world
now
available
to
men
ultimately
better
arrangements
could
be
made
jones
was
already
ecstatically
designing
dabney
field
installations
there
would
be
dabney
fields
extending
from
star
to
star
along
them
as
along
pneumatic
tubes
ships
would
travel
at
unthinkable
speeds
toward
absolutely
certain
destinations
true
at
times
they
could
not
be
used
because
of
the
bulk
of
planets
between
and
but
with
due
attention
to
scheduling
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
indeed
to
arrange
for
something
close
to
service
between
he
explained
all
this
to
cochrane
with
holden
listening
in
oh
surely
said
cochrane
cynically
and
you
have
objecting
because
you
make
money
you
be
regulated
out
of
existence
were
you
thinking
that
spaceways
would
run
this
transportation
system
you
planning
without
cutting
anybody
else
in
on
even
the
glory
of
it
jones
looked
at
him
but
he
was
annoyed
i
want
some
money
he
said
i
thought
we
could
get
this
thing
set
up
and
then
i
could
get
myself
a
ship
and
facilities
for
doing
some
really
original
work
i
like
to
work
something
out
and
not
have
to
sell
the
to
it
i
arrange
it
promised
cochrane
i
got
our
lawyers
setting
up
a
deal
right
now
you
going
to
get
as
many
tricky
patents
as
you
can
on
this
field
and
assign
them
all
to
spaceways
and
spaceways
is
going
to
assign
them
all
to
a
magnificent
space
development
association
a
sort
of
chamber
of
commerce
for
all
the
outer
planets
and
all
the
stuffed
shirts
in
creation
are
going
to
leap
madly
to
get
honorary
posts
on
it
and
it
will
be
practically
beyond
criticism
and
it
will
have
the
public
interest
passionately
at
its
heart
and
it
will
be
practically
beyond
interference
and
it
will
be
as
inefficient
as
hell
and
the
more
inefficient
it
is
the
more
it
will
have
to
take
in
to
allow
for
its
inefficiency
and
for
your
patents
it
has
to
give
us
a
flat
cut
of
its
gross
and
meanwhile
we
get
ours
from
the
planets
we
landed
on
and
publicized
we
got
customers
we
built
up
a
market
for
our
planets
eh
said
jones
in
frank
astonishment
we
said
cochrane
rate
as
first
inhabitants
and
therefore
proprietors
and
governments
of
the
first
two
planets
ever
landed
on
beyond
earth
when
the
was
formed
there
were
elaborate
laws
made
to
take
care
of
surviving
nation
prides
and
so
on
whoever
first
stays
on
a
planet
a
full
rotation
is
its
proprietor
and
government
until
other
inhabitants
arrive
then
the
government
is
all
of
them
but
the
proprietorship
remains
with
the
first
we
own
two
planets
nice
planets
glamorized
planets
too
so
i
already
made
deals
for
the
on
the
glacier
world
holden
had
listened
with
increasing
uneasiness
now
he
said
doggedly
that
not
right
jed
i
do
mind
making
money
but
there
are
things
that
are
more
important
millions
of
people
back
home
hundreds
of
millions
of
poor
devils
spend
their
lives
scared
to
death
of
losing
their
jobs
not
daring
to
hope
for
more
than
bare
subsistence
i
want
to
do
something
for
them
people
need
hope
jed
simply
to
be
healthy
maybe
i
a
fool
but
the
human
race
needs
hope
more
than
i
need
money
cochrane
looked
patient
what
would
you
suggest
i
think
said
holden
heavily
that
we
ought
to
give
what
we
got
to
the
world
let
the
governments
of
the
world
take
over
and
assist
emigration
there
not
one
but
will
be
glad
to
do
it
unfortunately
said
cochrane
you
are
perfectly
right
they
would
there
have
been
resettlement
projects
and
such
stuff
for
generations
i
very
much
afraid
that
just
what
you
propose
will
be
done
to
some
degree
somewhere
or
other
on
other
planets
as
they
turned
up
but
on
the
glacier
planet
there
will
be
hotels
the
rich
will
want
to
go
there
to
stay
to
to
ride
to
hunt
to
ski
and
to
fly
in
helicopters
over
volcanoes
the
hotels
will
need
to
be
staffed
there
will
be
guides
and
foresters
and
hunters
it
will
cost
too
much
to
bring
food
from
earth
so
farms
will
be
started
it
will
be
cheaper
to
buy
food
from
independent
farmers
than
to
raise
it
with
hired
help
so
the
farmers
will
be
independent
there
will
have
to
be
stores
to
supply
them
with
what
they
need
and
tourists
with
what
they
do
need
but
want
from
the
minute
the
glacier
planet
starts
up
as
a
tourist
resort
there
will
be
jobs
for
hundreds
of
people
it
wo
be
long
before
there
are
jobs
for
thousands
there
be
a
there
anybody
who
wants
to
can
go
there
to
work
and
if
he
does
go
there
expecting
a
certified
psychologically
conditioned
environment
but
just
a
good
job
with
possible
or
probable
advancement
that
the
environment
we
humans
want
presently
the
hotels
wo
even
be
tourist
hotels
just
be
the
normal
hotels
that
exist
everywhere
that
there
are
cities
and
people
moving
about
among
them
then
it
wo
be
a
and
tourists
will
be
a
nuisance
it
be
home
for
one
hell
of
a
lot
of
people
and
they
have
made
every
bit
of
it
themselves
holden
said
uncomfortably
it
be
slow
it
be
sure
snapped
cochrane
the
first
settlements
in
america
were
failures
until
the
people
started
to
work
for
themselves
look
at
this
planet
we
leaving
how
many
people
will
come
to
work
that
silly
diamond
mine
how
many
will
hunt
to
supply
them
with
meat
how
many
will
farm
to
supply
the
hunters
and
the
miners
with
other
food
and
how
many
others
will
be
along
to
run
stores
and
manufacture
things
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
you
thinking
of
encouraging
people
to
move
to
the
stars
to
make
more
room
on
earth
you
get
nice
passive
colonists
who
obediently
move
because
the
said
it
was
wise
and
the
government
paid
for
it
i
thinking
of
colonists
who
fight
and
quite
possibly
cheat
and
lie
a
little
to
get
jobs
where
they
can
take
care
of
their
families
the
way
they
want
to
i
want
people
to
move
to
get
what
they
want
in
spite
of
any
discouragement
anybody
throws
at
them
now
shoo
i
busy
jones
asked
mildly
at
what
the
latest
proposed
deal
said
cochrane
impatiently
is
for
rights
to
bore
for
oil
the
uranium
concessions
are
farmed
out
is
pending
not
for
cash
but
a
cut
and
holden
said
uneasily
there
one
other
thing
jed
all
your
plans
and
all
your
scheming
could
still
be
blocked
if
back
on
earth
they
think
we
might
bring
plagues
back
to
earth
remember
dabney
suggested
that
and
some
biologist
or
other
agreed
with
him
cochrane
grinned
there
a
there
are
herds
of
what
people
will
call
cattle
there
food
and
riches
there
scenery
and
adventure
room
to
do
things
nobody
could
keep
political
office
if
he
tried
to
keep
his
constituents
from
food
and
cash
and
adventure
even
by
proxy
when
they
send
expendable
cousin
albert
out
to
see
if
he
can
make
a
living
there
we
got
to
take
reasonable
precautions
against
germs
of
course
we
have
trouble
enforcing
them
but
we
manage
al
called
down
from
the
the
ship
was
sufficiently
aligned
he
thought
for
their
next
he
wanted
jones
to
charge
the
and
flash
it
over
jones
went
a
little
later
there
was
the
peculiar
sensation
of
a
sound
that
was
not
a
sound
but
was
felt
all
through
one
the
result
was
not
satisfactory
the
ship
was
still
in
empty
space
and
the
nearest
star
was
still
a
star
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
still
not
too
good
thereafter
the
ship
drove
and
jumped
and
jumped
and
drove
jamison
came
down
to
where
cochrane
conducted
business
via
communicator
he
waited
cochrane
said
dammit
i
wo
agree
i
want
twelve
per
cent
or
i
take
up
another
offer
what
the
last
was
to
jamison
jamison
said
uneasily
we
found
another
planet
about
clouds
oceans
seas
even
rivers
but
there
no
green
on
it
it
all
bare
rocks
cochrane
thought
concentratedly
then
he
said
impatiently
the
whiskered
people
back
home
said
that
life
could
have
gotten
started
on
all
the
planets
suited
for
it
they
said
there
must
be
planets
where
life
has
reached
though
they
perfectly
suited
for
it
make
a
landing
and
try
the
air
with
algae
like
we
did
on
the
first
planet
he
turned
back
to
the
communicator
you
reason
he
snapped
to
a
man
on
earth
that
all
this
is
only
on
paper
but
that
the
only
reason
you
getting
a
chance
at
it
i
guarantee
that
jones
will
install
drives
on
ships
that
meet
our
requirements
of
or
government
standards
whichever
are
strictest
for
ten
per
cent
of
your
company
stock
plus
twelve
per
cent
cash
of
the
cost
of
each
ship
nothing
less
he
heard
the
rockets
make
the
louder
sound
that
was
the
symptom
of
descent
against
gravity
the
world
was
lifeless
the
ship
had
landed
on
bare
stone
when
cochrane
looked
out
the
ports
there
had
been
trouble
finding
a
flat
space
on
which
the
three
would
find
a
suitable
foundation
it
had
taken
half
an
hour
of
maneuvering
to
locate
such
a
place
and
to
settle
solidly
on
it
then
the
look
of
things
was
appalling
the
was
a
naked
mass
of
what
seemed
to
be
basalt
polygons
similar
to
the
giants
causeway
of
ireland
back
on
earth
there
was
no
softness
anywhere
the
stone
which
on
other
planets
underlay
soil
here
showed
harshly
there
was
no
soil
there
was
no
microscopic
life
to
nibble
at
rocks
and
make
soil
in
which
less
minute
life
could
live
the
nudity
of
the
stones
led
to
glaring
colors
everywhere
the
colors
were
brilliant
as
nowhere
else
but
on
earth
moon
there
was
no
vegetation
at
all
that
was
somehow
shocking
the
ship
company
stared
and
stared
but
there
could
be
no
comment
there
was
a
vast
dark
sea
to
the
left
of
the
inland
there
were
mountains
and
valleys
but
the
mountains
were
not
sloped
there
were
heaps
of
detritus
at
the
bases
of
their
cliffs
but
it
was
simply
detritus
no
tiniest
patch
of
lichen
grew
anywhere
no
blade
of
grass
no
moss
no
leaf
nothing
the
air
was
empty
nothing
flew
there
were
clouds
to
be
sure
the
sky
was
even
blue
though
a
darker
blue
than
earth
because
there
was
no
vegetation
to
break
stone
down
to
dust
or
to
form
dust
by
its
own
decay
the
sea
was
violently
active
great
waves
flung
themselves
toward
the
harsh
coastline
and
beat
upon
it
with
insensate
violence
they
shattered
into
masses
of
foam
but
the
foam
broke
too
quickly
and
left
the
surging
water
dark
again
far
down
the
line
of
foam
there
were
dark
clouds
and
rain
fell
in
masses
and
lightning
flashed
but
it
was
a
scene
of
desolation
which
was
somehow
more
horrible
even
than
the
scarred
and
battered
moon
of
earth
cochrane
looked
out
very
carefully
alicia
came
to
him
a
trifle
hesitant
johnny
asleep
now
he
did
sleep
at
first
and
while
we
were
out
of
gravity
he
was
unhappy
but
he
went
off
to
sleep
the
instant
we
landed
he
needs
rest
could
we
just
stay
landed
here
until
he
catches
up
on
sleep
cochrane
nodded
alicia
smiled
at
him
and
went
away
there
was
still
the
mark
of
a
bruise
on
her
cheek
she
went
down
to
where
her
husband
needed
her
holden
said
dourly
this
world
useless
so
is
her
husband
wait
till
we
check
the
air
said
cochrane
absently
i
checked
it
holden
told
him
indifferently
i
went
in
the
port
and
sniffed
at
the
cracked
outer
door
i
did
die
so
i
opened
the
door
there
is
a
smell
of
stone
that
all
the
air
perfectly
breathable
the
ocean
probably
absorbed
all
soluble
gases
and
poisonous
gases
are
soluble
if
they
were
they
could
be
poisonous
mmmmmm
said
cochrane
thoughtfully
jamison
came
over
to
him
we
not
going
to
stay
here
are
we
he
asked
i
do
like
to
look
at
it
the
moon
bad
enough
but
at
least
nothing
could
live
there
anything
could
live
here
but
it
does
i
do
like
it
we
stay
here
at
least
while
johnny
has
a
nap
i
do
want
bell
to
take
all
the
pictures
he
can
though
probably
not
for
broadcast
but
for
business
reasons
i
need
pictures
to
back
up
a
deal
jamison
went
away
holden
said
without
interest
you
make
no
deals
with
this
planet
this
is
one
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
i
do
want
any
part
of
it
cochrane
shrugged
speaking
of
things
you
do
want
any
part
of
what
about
johnny
simms
speaking
as
a
psychiatrist
what
effect
will
that
business
of
being
in
the
dark
all
night
and
nearly
being
pecked
to
death
what
will
it
do
to
him
are
psychopaths
the
way
they
are
because
they
ca
face
reality
or
because
they
never
had
to
holden
stared
away
down
the
incredible
lifeless
coastline
at
the
distant
storm
there
was
darkness
under
many
layers
of
cloud
the
sea
foamed
and
lashed
and
instantly
was
free
of
foam
again
because
there
were
no
plankton
no
animalcules
no
tiny
gluey
organic
beings
in
it
to
give
the
water
the
property
of
making
foam
which
endured
there
was
thunder
yonder
in
the
storm
and
no
ear
heard
it
over
a
vast
world
there
was
sunshine
which
no
eyes
saw
there
was
night
in
which
nothing
rested
and
somewhere
dawn
was
breaking
now
and
nothing
sang
look
at
that
jed
said
holden
heavily
there
a
reality
none
of
us
wants
to
face
we
all
more
or
less
fugitives
from
what
we
are
afraid
is
reality
that
is
real
and
it
makes
me
feel
small
and
futile
so
i
do
like
to
look
at
it
johnny
simms
did
want
to
face
what
one
does
grow
up
to
face
it
made
him
feel
futile
so
he
picked
a
pleasanter
role
than
realist
cochrane
nodded
but
his
unrealism
of
last
night
put
him
into
a
very
realistic
mess
that
he
could
dodge
will
it
change
him
probably
said
holden
without
any
expression
at
all
in
his
voice
they
used
to
put
lunatics
in
when
they
were
people
taken
to
lunacy
for
escape
from
reality
it
made
them
go
back
to
reality
to
escape
from
the
snakes
used
to
be
used
later
for
the
same
effect
we
too
soft
to
use
either
treatment
now
but
johnny
gave
himself
the
works
the
odds
are
that
from
now
on
he
will
never
want
to
be
alone
even
for
an
instant
and
he
will
never
again
quite
dare
to
be
angry
with
anybody
or
make
anybody
angry
you
choked
him
and
he
ran
away
and
it
was
bad
so
from
now
on
i
guess
that
johnny
will
be
a
very
little
boy
in
a
grown
man
body
he
said
very
wryly
indeed
alicia
will
be
very
happy
taking
care
of
him
a
moment
later
he
added
i
look
at
that
the
way
i
look
at
the
landscape
yonder
cochrane
said
nothing
holden
liked
alicia
too
much
it
would
not
make
any
difference
at
all
after
a
moment
though
he
changed
the
subject
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
bet
this
planet
you
think
it
no
good
i
going
to
talk
to
the
chlorella
companies
they
grow
edible
yeast
in
tanks
and
chlorella
in
vats
and
they
produce
an
important
amount
of
food
but
they
have
to
grow
the
stuff
indoors
and
they
have
a
ghastly
job
keeping
everything
sterile
here
a
place
where
they
can
sow
chlorella
in
the
oceans
they
can
grow
yeast
in
lakes
suppose
they
use
this
world
to
grow
monstrous
quantities
of
unattractive
but
useful
foodstuff
in
a
way
wild
it
will
be
good
material
for
ships
taking
colonists
out
to
our
other
i
suppose
he
added
meditatively
they
ship
it
back
in
bulk
dried
holden
blinked
he
was
jolted
out
of
even
his
depression
jed
he
said
warmly
tell
that
to
the
world
prove
that
and
people
will
stop
being
afraid
they
wo
be
afraid
of
starving
before
they
can
get
to
the
stars
jed
jed
this
is
the
thing
the
world
needs
most
of
all
but
cochrane
grimaced
maybe
he
admitted
it
but
i
tasted
the
stuff
i
think
it
foul
still
if
people
want
it
he
went
back
down
to
the
communicator
to
contact
the
chlorella
companies
of
earth
to
find
out
if
there
was
any
special
data
they
would
need
to
pass
on
the
proposal
and
so
presently
the
ship
took
off
for
home
it
landed
on
the
moon
first
and
johnny
simms
was
loaded
into
a
and
transferred
to
lunar
city
where
he
could
live
without
being
extradited
back
to
earth
he
would
stay
there
alicia
guaranteed
that
they
move
to
the
glacier
planet
as
soon
as
hotels
were
built
maybe
some
day
travel
to
the
planet
of
the
shaggy
beasts
johnny
would
never
be
troublesome
again
he
was
pathetically
anxious
now
to
have
people
like
him
and
stay
with
him
and
not
under
any
circumstances
be
angry
with
him
or
shut
him
away
from
them
alicia
would
now
have
a
occupation
keeping
people
from
taking
advantage
of
him
but
the
ship
went
back
to
earth
and
on
earth
jamison
became
the
leading
television
personality
of
all
time
describing
and
extrapolating
the
delicious
dangers
and
the
splendid
industrial
opportunities
of
bell
was
his
companion
and
presently
jamison
conceded
privately
to
cochrane
that
he
and
bell
would
need
shortly
to
take
off
on
another
journey
of
exploration
with
some
other
expedition
neither
of
them
thought
to
retire
though
they
were
enough
they
were
in
the
spaceways
company
which
guaranteed
them
a
living
cochrane
put
spaceways
into
full
operation
he
fought
savagely
against
personal
publicity
but
he
worked
himself
half
to
death
he
spent
hours
every
day
in
frenzied
haggling
and
in
the
cynical
examination
of
deftly
business
proposals
his
lawyers
insisted
that
he
needed
an
office
he
did
and
presently
he
had
four
secretaries
and
there
developed
an
entire
hierarchy
of
persons
under
him
one
day
his
chief
secretary
told
him
commiseratingly
that
somebody
had
waited
two
hours
past
to
see
him
it
was
hopkins
who
had
not
been
willing
to
interrupt
his
dinner
to
listen
to
a
protest
from
cochrane
hopkins
was
still
exactly
as
important
as
ever
it
was
only
that
cochrane
was
more
so
it
woke
cochrane
up
he
stormed
to
babs
and
ruthlessly
cancelled
appointments
and
abandoned
or
transferred
enterprises
and
made
preparations
for
a
more
satisfactory
way
of
life
they
went
in
time
to
the
spaceways
terminal
to
take
ship
for
the
stars
the
terminal
was
improvised
but
it
was
busy
already
eighteen
ships
a
day
went
away
from
there
in
dabney
fields
eighteen
others
arrived
jones
was
already
off
somewhere
in
a
ship
built
according
to
his
own
notions
officially
he
was
doing
research
for
spaceways
but
actually
nobody
told
him
what
to
do
he
puttered
happily
with
improbable
contrivances
and
sometimes
got
even
more
improbable
results
holden
was
already
off
of
earth
he
was
on
the
planet
of
the
shaggy
beasts
acting
as
consultant
on
the
cases
of
persons
who
arrived
there
and
became
emotionally
disturbed
because
they
could
do
as
they
pleased
instead
of
being
forced
by
economic
necessity
to
do
otherwise
but
this
day
babs
and
cochrane
went
together
into
the
grand
concourse
of
the
spaceways
terminal
there
were
people
everywhere
the
of
enterprises
on
the
three
planets
now
under
development
took
applications
for
jobs
on
those
remote
worlds
and
explained
how
long
one
had
to
contract
to
work
in
order
to
have
one
fare
paid
chambers
of
commerce
representatives
were
prepared
to
give
technical
information
to
prospective
entrepreneurs
there
were
and
desks
and
desks
hmmm
said
cochrane
suddenly
know
i
have
heard
of
dabney
in
months
what
happened
to
him
dabney
said
babs
she
beamed
women
in
the
terminal
saw
the
clothes
she
was
wearing
they
did
not
recognize
her
cochrane
had
kept
her
off
the
air
but
they
envied
her
she
felt
very
nice
indeed
dabney
oh
i
had
to
use
my
own
judgment
there
jed
you
were
so
busy
after
all
he
was
scientific
consultant
to
spaceways
he
did
pay
jones
cold
cash
for
when
everything
else
got
so
much
more
important
than
just
the
scientific
theory
he
got
in
a
terrible
state
his
family
consulted
doctor
holden
and
we
arranged
it
he
right
down
this
way
she
pointed
and
there
was
a
splendid
office
built
out
from
the
wall
of
the
grand
concourse
it
was
elevated
so
that
it
was
charmingly
conspicuous
there
was
a
chastely
designed
but
highly
visible
sign
under
the
stairway
leading
to
it
the
sign
said
dabney
scientific
dabney
sat
at
an
imposing
desk
in
plain
view
of
all
the
thousands
who
had
shipped
out
and
the
millions
who
would
ship
out
in
time
to
come
he
thought
visibly
presently
he
stood
up
and
paced
meditatively
up
and
down
the
office
which
was
as
as
a
bowl
of
equal
size
in
the
same
place
he
seemed
to
see
someone
down
in
the
concourse
he
could
have
recognized
cochrane
of
course
but
he
did
not
he
bowed
he
was
a
great
man
undoubtedly
he
returned
to
his
wife
each
evening
happily
convinced
that
he
had
done
the
world
a
great
favor
by
permitting
it
to
glimpse
him
cochrane
and
babs
went
on
their
baggage
was
taken
care
of
the
departure
of
a
ship
for
the
stars
these
days
was
much
less
complicated
and
vastly
more
comfortable
than
it
used
to
be
when
a
mere
took
off
when
they
were
in
the
ship
babs
heaved
a
sigh
of
absolute
relief
now
she
said
zestfully
now
you
retired
jed
you
do
have
to
worry
about
anything
and
so
now
i
going
to
try
to
make
you
worry
about
me
not
worry
about
me
but
think
about
me
of
course
said
cochrane
he
regarded
her
with
honest
affection
we
take
a
good
long
vacation
first
on
the
glacier
planet
then
we
build
a
house
somewhere
in
the
hills
back
of
diamondville
jed
said
babs
accusingly
there
a
fair
population
there
already
said
cochrane
apologetically
it
wo
be
long
before
a
local
television
station
will
be
logical
i
was
just
thinking
babs
that
after
we
get
bored
with
loafing
i
could
start
a
program
there
really
sound
stuff
not
commercial
and
of
course
with
the
dabney
field
it
could
be
piped
back
to
earth
if
any
sponsor
wanted
it
i
think
they
would
presently
the
ship
with
babs
and
cochrane
among
its
passengers
took
off
to
the
stars
it
was
a
perfectly
routine
flight
after
all
was
almost
six
months
old
it
was
a
novelty
any
longer
operation
outer
space
was
old
