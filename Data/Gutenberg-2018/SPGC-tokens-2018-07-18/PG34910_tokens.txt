the
inner
beauty
nothing
in
the
whole
world
is
so
athirst
for
beauty
as
the
soul
nor
is
there
anything
to
which
beauty
clings
so
readily
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
capable
of
such
spontaneous
uplifting
of
such
speedy
ennoblement
nothing
that
offers
more
scrupulous
obedience
to
the
pure
and
noble
commands
it
receives
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
yields
deeper
submission
to
the
empire
of
a
thought
that
is
loftier
than
other
thoughts
and
on
this
earth
of
ours
there
are
but
few
souls
that
can
withstand
the
dominion
of
the
soul
that
has
suffered
itself
to
become
beautiful
in
all
truth
might
it
be
said
that
beauty
is
the
unique
aliment
of
our
soul
for
in
all
places
does
it
search
for
beauty
and
it
perishes
not
of
hunger
even
in
the
most
degraded
of
lives
for
indeed
nothing
of
beauty
can
pass
by
and
be
altogether
unperceived
perhaps
does
it
never
pass
by
save
only
in
our
unconsciousness
but
its
action
is
no
less
puissant
in
gloom
of
night
than
by
light
of
day
the
joy
it
procures
may
be
less
tangible
but
other
difference
there
is
none
look
at
the
most
ordinary
of
men
at
a
time
when
a
little
beauty
has
contrived
to
steal
into
their
darkness
they
have
come
together
it
matters
not
where
and
for
no
special
reason
but
no
sooner
are
they
assembled
than
their
very
first
thought
would
seem
to
be
to
close
the
great
doors
of
life
yet
has
each
one
of
them
when
alone
more
than
once
lived
in
accord
with
his
soul
he
has
loved
perhaps
of
a
surety
he
has
suffered
inevitably
must
he
too
have
heard
the
sounds
that
come
from
the
distant
country
of
splendor
and
terror
and
many
an
evening
has
he
bowed
down
in
silence
before
laws
that
are
deeper
than
the
sea
and
yet
when
these
men
are
assembled
it
is
with
the
basest
of
things
that
they
love
to
debauch
themselves
they
have
a
strange
indescribable
fear
of
beauty
and
as
their
number
increases
so
does
this
fear
become
greater
resembling
indeed
their
dread
of
silence
or
of
a
verity
that
is
too
pure
and
so
true
is
this
that
were
one
of
them
to
have
done
something
heroic
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
would
ascribe
wretched
motives
to
his
conduct
thereby
endeavoring
to
find
excuses
for
it
and
these
motives
would
lie
readily
to
his
hand
in
that
lower
region
where
he
and
his
fellows
were
assembled
and
yet
listen
a
proud
and
lofty
word
has
been
spoken
a
word
that
has
in
a
measure
undammed
the
springs
of
life
for
one
instant
has
a
soul
dared
to
reveal
itself
even
such
as
it
is
in
love
and
sorrow
such
as
it
is
in
face
of
death
and
in
the
solitude
that
dwells
around
the
stars
of
night
disquiet
prevails
on
some
faces
there
is
astonishment
others
smile
but
have
you
never
felt
at
moments
such
as
those
how
unanimous
is
the
fervor
wherewith
every
soul
admires
and
how
unspeakably
even
the
very
feeblest
from
the
remotest
depths
of
its
dungeon
approves
the
word
it
has
recognized
as
akin
to
itself
for
they
have
all
suddenly
sprung
to
life
again
in
the
primitive
and
normal
atmosphere
that
is
their
own
and
could
you
but
hearken
with
angels
ears
i
doubt
not
but
you
would
hear
mightiest
applause
in
that
kingdom
of
amazing
radiance
wherein
the
souls
do
dwell
do
you
not
think
that
even
the
most
timid
of
them
would
take
courage
unto
themselves
were
but
similar
words
to
be
spoken
every
evening
do
you
not
think
that
men
would
live
purer
lives
and
yet
though
the
word
come
not
again
still
will
something
momentous
have
happened
that
must
leave
still
more
momentous
trace
behind
every
evening
will
its
sisters
recognize
the
soul
that
pronounced
the
word
and
henceforth
be
the
conversation
never
so
trivial
its
mere
presence
will
i
know
not
how
add
thereto
something
of
majesty
whatever
else
betide
there
has
been
a
change
that
we
can
not
determine
no
longer
will
such
absolute
power
be
vested
in
the
baser
side
of
things
and
henceforth
even
the
most
of
souls
will
know
that
there
is
somewhere
a
place
of
refuge
certain
it
is
that
the
natural
and
primitive
relationship
of
soul
to
soul
is
a
relationship
of
beauty
for
beauty
is
the
only
language
of
our
soul
none
other
is
known
to
it
it
has
no
other
life
it
can
produce
nothing
else
in
nothing
else
can
it
take
interest
and
therefore
it
is
that
the
most
oppressed
nay
the
most
degraded
of
souls
if
it
may
truly
be
said
that
a
soul
can
be
degraded
immediately
hail
with
acclamation
every
thought
every
word
or
deed
that
is
great
and
beautiful
beauty
is
the
only
element
wherewith
the
soul
is
organically
connected
and
it
has
no
other
standard
of
judgment
this
is
brought
home
to
us
at
every
moment
of
our
life
and
is
no
less
evident
to
the
man
by
whom
beauty
may
more
than
once
have
been
denied
than
to
him
who
is
ever
seeking
it
in
his
heart
should
a
day
come
when
you
stand
in
profoundest
need
of
another
sympathy
would
you
go
to
him
who
was
wont
to
greet
the
passage
of
beauty
with
a
sneering
smile
would
you
go
to
him
whose
shake
of
the
head
had
sullied
a
generous
action
or
a
mere
impulse
that
was
pure
even
though
perhaps
you
had
been
of
those
who
commended
him
you
would
none
the
less
when
it
was
truth
that
knocked
at
your
door
turn
to
the
man
who
had
known
how
to
prostrate
himself
and
love
in
its
very
depths
had
your
soul
passed
its
judgment
and
it
is
the
silent
and
unerring
judgment
that
will
rise
to
the
surface
after
thirty
years
perhaps
and
send
you
towards
a
sister
who
shall
be
more
truly
you
than
you
are
yourself
for
that
she
has
been
nearer
to
beauty
there
needs
but
so
little
to
encourage
beauty
in
our
soul
so
little
to
awaken
the
slumbering
angels
or
perhaps
is
there
no
need
of
awakening
it
is
enough
that
we
lull
them
not
to
sleep
it
requires
more
effort
to
fall
perhaps
than
to
rise
can
we
without
putting
constraint
upon
ourselves
confine
our
thoughts
to
everyday
things
at
times
when
the
sea
stretches
before
us
and
we
are
face
to
face
with
the
night
and
what
soul
is
there
but
knows
that
it
is
ever
confronting
the
sea
ever
in
presence
of
an
eternal
night
did
we
but
dread
beauty
less
it
would
come
about
that
nought
else
in
life
would
be
visible
for
in
reality
it
is
beauty
that
underlies
everything
it
is
beauty
alone
that
exists
there
is
no
soul
but
is
conscious
of
this
none
that
is
not
in
readiness
but
where
are
those
that
hide
not
their
beauty
and
yet
must
one
of
them
begin
why
not
dare
to
be
the
one
to
begin
the
others
are
all
watching
eagerly
around
us
like
little
children
in
front
of
a
marvelous
place
they
press
upon
the
threshold
whispering
to
each
other
and
peering
through
every
crevice
but
there
is
not
one
who
dares
put
his
shoulder
to
the
door
they
are
all
waiting
for
some
person
to
come
and
fling
it
open
but
hardly
ever
does
such
a
one
pass
by
and
yet
what
is
needed
to
become
the
person
for
whom
they
lie
in
wait
so
little
the
soul
is
not
exacting
a
thought
that
is
almost
beautiful
a
thought
that
you
speak
not
but
that
you
cherish
within
you
at
this
moment
will
irradiate
you
as
though
you
were
a
transparent
vase
they
will
see
it
and
their
greeting
to
you
will
be
very
different
than
had
you
been
meditating
how
best
to
deceive
your
brother
we
are
surprised
when
certain
men
tell
us
that
they
have
never
come
across
real
ugliness
that
they
can
not
conceive
that
a
soul
can
be
base
yet
need
there
be
no
cause
for
surprise
these
men
had
begun
they
themselves
had
been
the
first
to
be
beautiful
and
had
therefore
attracted
all
the
beauty
that
passed
by
as
a
lighthouse
attracts
the
vessels
from
the
four
corners
of
the
horizon
but
there
are
those
who
complain
of
women
for
instance
never
dreaming
that
the
first
time
a
man
meets
a
woman
a
single
word
or
thought
that
denies
the
beautiful
or
profound
will
be
enough
to
poison
for
ever
his
existence
in
her
soul
for
my
part
said
a
sage
to
me
one
day
i
have
never
come
across
a
single
woman
who
did
not
bring
to
me
something
that
was
great
he
was
great
himself
first
of
all
therein
lay
his
secret
there
is
one
thing
only
that
the
soul
can
never
forgive
it
is
to
have
been
compelled
to
behold
or
share
or
pass
close
to
an
ugly
action
word
or
thought
it
can
not
forgive
for
forgiveness
here
were
but
the
denial
of
itself
and
yet
with
the
generality
of
men
ingenuity
strength
and
skill
do
but
imply
that
the
soul
must
first
of
all
be
banished
from
their
life
and
that
every
impulse
that
lies
too
deep
must
be
carefully
brushed
aside
even
in
love
do
they
act
thus
and
therefore
it
is
that
the
woman
who
is
so
much
nearer
the
truth
can
scarcely
ever
live
a
moment
of
the
true
life
with
them
it
is
as
though
men
dreaded
the
contact
of
their
soul
and
were
anxious
to
keep
its
beauty
at
immeasurable
distance
whereas
on
the
contrary
we
should
endeavor
to
move
in
advance
of
ourselves
if
at
this
moment
you
think
or
say
something
that
is
too
beautiful
to
be
true
in
you
if
you
have
but
endeavored
to
think
or
say
it
on
the
morrow
it
will
be
true
we
must
try
to
be
more
beautiful
than
ourselves
we
shall
never
distance
our
soul
we
can
never
err
when
it
is
question
of
silent
or
hidden
beauty
besides
so
long
as
the
spring
within
us
be
limpid
it
matters
but
little
whether
error
there
be
or
not
but
do
any
of
us
ever
dream
of
making
the
slightest
unseen
effort
and
yet
in
the
domain
where
we
are
everything
is
effective
for
that
everything
is
waiting
all
the
doors
are
unlocked
we
have
but
to
push
them
open
and
the
palace
is
full
of
manacled
queens
a
single
word
will
very
often
suffice
to
clear
the
mountain
of
refuse
why
not
have
the
courage
to
meet
a
base
question
with
a
noble
answer
do
you
imagine
it
would
pass
quite
unnoticed
or
merely
arouse
surprise
do
you
not
think
it
would
be
more
akin
to
the
discourse
that
would
naturally
be
held
between
two
souls
we
know
not
where
it
may
give
encouragement
where
freedom
even
he
who
rejects
your
word
will
in
spite
of
himself
have
taken
a
step
towards
the
beauty
that
is
within
him
nothing
of
beauty
dies
without
having
purified
something
nor
can
aught
of
beauty
be
lost
let
us
not
be
afraid
of
sowing
it
along
the
road
it
may
remain
there
for
weeks
or
years
but
like
the
diamond
it
can
not
dissolve
and
finally
there
will
pass
by
some
one
whom
its
glitter
will
attract
he
will
pick
it
up
and
go
his
way
rejoicing
then
why
keep
back
a
lofty
beautiful
word
for
that
you
doubt
whether
others
will
understand
an
instant
of
higher
goodness
was
impending
over
you
why
hinder
its
coming
even
though
you
believe
not
that
those
about
you
will
profit
thereby
what
if
you
are
among
men
of
the
valley
is
that
sufficient
reason
for
checking
the
instinctive
movement
of
your
soul
towards
the
mountain
peaks
does
darkness
rob
deep
feeling
of
its
power
have
the
blind
nought
but
their
eyes
wherewith
to
distinguish
those
who
love
them
from
those
who
love
them
not
can
the
beauty
not
exist
that
is
not
understood
and
is
there
not
in
every
man
something
that
does
understand
in
regions
far
beyond
what
he
seems
to
understand
far
beyond
too
what
he
believes
he
understands
even
to
the
very
wretchedest
of
all
said
to
me
one
day
the
loftiest
minded
creature
it
has
ever
been
my
happiness
to
know
even
to
the
very
wretchedest
of
all
i
never
have
the
courage
to
say
anything
in
reply
that
is
ugly
or
mediocre
i
have
for
a
long
time
followed
that
man
life
and
have
seen
the
inexplicable
power
he
exercised
over
the
most
obscure
the
most
unapproachable
the
blindest
even
the
most
rebellious
of
souls
for
no
tongue
can
tell
the
power
of
a
soul
that
strives
to
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
beauty
and
is
actively
beautiful
in
itself
and
indeed
is
it
not
the
quality
of
this
activity
that
renders
life
either
miserable
or
divine
if
we
could
but
probe
to
the
root
of
things
it
might
well
be
discovered
that
it
is
by
the
strength
of
some
souls
that
are
beautiful
that
others
are
sustained
in
life
is
it
not
the
idea
we
each
form
of
certain
chosen
ones
that
constitutes
the
only
living
effective
morality
but
in
this
idea
how
much
is
there
of
the
soul
that
is
chosen
how
much
of
him
who
chooses
do
not
these
things
blend
very
mysteriously
and
does
not
this
ideal
morality
lie
infinitely
deeper
than
the
morality
of
the
most
beautiful
books
a
influence
exists
therein
whose
limits
it
is
indeed
difficult
to
define
and
a
fountain
of
strength
whereat
we
all
of
us
drink
many
times
a
day
would
not
any
weakness
in
one
of
those
creatures
whom
you
thought
perfect
and
loved
in
the
region
of
beauty
at
once
lessen
your
confidence
in
the
universal
greatness
of
things
and
would
your
admiration
for
them
suffer
and
again
i
doubt
whether
anything
in
the
world
can
beautify
a
soul
more
spontaneously
more
naturally
than
the
knowledge
that
somewhere
in
its
neighborhood
there
exists
a
pure
and
noble
being
whom
it
can
unreservedly
love
when
the
soul
has
veritably
drawn
near
to
such
a
being
beauty
is
no
longer
a
lovely
lifeless
thing
that
one
exhibits
to
the
stranger
for
it
suddenly
takes
unto
itself
an
imperious
existence
and
its
activity
becomes
so
natural
as
to
be
henceforth
irresistible
wherefore
you
will
do
well
to
think
it
over
for
none
are
alone
and
those
who
are
good
must
watch
plotinus
in
the
eighth
book
of
the
fifth
ennead
after
speaking
of
the
beauty
that
is
intelligible
divine
concludes
thus
as
regards
ourselves
we
are
beautiful
when
we
belong
to
ourselves
and
ugly
when
we
lower
ourselves
to
our
inferior
nature
also
are
we
beautiful
when
we
know
such
knowledge
bear
it
in
mind
however
that
here
we
are
on
the
mountains
where
not
to
know
oneself
means
far
more
than
mere
ignorance
of
what
takes
place
within
us
at
moments
of
jealousy
or
love
fear
or
envy
happiness
or
unhappiness
here
not
to
know
oneself
means
to
be
unconscious
of
all
the
divine
that
throbs
in
man
as
we
wander
from
the
gods
within
us
so
does
ugliness
enwrap
us
as
we
discover
them
so
do
we
become
more
beautiful
but
it
is
only
by
revealing
the
divine
that
is
in
us
that
we
may
discover
the
divine
in
others
needs
must
one
god
beckon
to
another
and
no
signal
is
so
imperceptible
but
they
will
every
one
of
them
respond
it
can
not
be
said
too
often
that
be
the
crevice
never
so
small
it
will
yet
suffice
for
all
the
waters
of
heaven
to
pour
into
our
soul
every
cup
is
stretched
out
to
the
unknown
spring
and
we
are
in
a
region
where
none
think
of
aught
but
beauty
if
we
could
ask
of
an
angel
what
it
is
that
our
souls
do
in
the
shadow
i
believe
the
angel
would
answer
after
having
looked
for
many
years
perhaps
and
seen
far
more
than
the
things
the
soul
seems
to
do
in
the
eyes
of
men
they
transform
into
beauty
all
the
little
things
that
are
given
to
them
ah
we
must
admit
that
the
human
soul
is
possessed
of
singular
courage
resignedly
does
it
labor
its
whole
life
long
in
the
darkness
whither
most
of
us
relegate
it
where
it
is
spoken
to
by
none
there
never
complaining
does
it
do
all
that
in
its
power
lies
striving
to
tear
from
out
the
pebbles
we
fling
to
it
the
nucleus
of
eternal
light
that
peradventure
they
contain
and
in
the
midst
of
its
work
it
is
ever
lying
in
wait
for
the
moment
when
it
may
show
to
a
sister
who
is
more
tenderly
cared
for
or
who
chances
to
be
nearer
the
treasures
it
has
so
toilfully
amassed
but
thousands
of
existences
there
are
that
no
sister
visits
thousands
of
existences
wherein
life
has
infused
such
timidity
into
the
soul
that
it
departs
without
saying
a
word
without
even
once
having
been
able
to
deck
itself
with
the
humblest
jewels
of
its
humble
crown
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
does
it
watch
over
everything
from
out
its
invisible
heaven
it
warns
and
loves
it
admires
attracts
repels
at
every
fresh
event
does
it
rise
to
the
surface
where
it
lingers
till
it
be
thrust
down
again
being
looked
upon
as
wearisome
and
insane
it
wanders
to
and
fro
like
cassandra
at
the
gates
of
the
atrides
it
is
ever
giving
utterance
to
words
of
shadowy
truth
but
there
are
none
to
listen
when
we
raise
our
eyes
it
yearns
for
a
ray
of
sun
or
star
that
it
may
weave
into
a
thought
or
haply
an
impulse
which
shall
be
unconscious
and
very
pure
and
if
our
eyes
bring
it
nothing
still
will
it
know
how
to
turn
its
pitiful
disillusion
into
something
ineffable
that
it
will
conceal
even
till
its
death
when
we
love
how
eagerly
does
it
drink
in
the
light
from
behind
the
closed
door
keen
with
expectation
it
yet
wastes
not
a
minute
and
the
light
that
steals
through
the
apertures
becomes
beauty
and
truth
to
the
soul
but
if
the
door
open
not
and
how
many
lives
are
there
wherein
it
does
open
it
will
go
back
into
its
prison
and
its
regret
will
perhaps
be
a
loftier
verity
that
shall
never
be
seen
for
we
are
now
in
the
region
of
transformations
whereof
none
may
speak
and
though
nothing
born
this
side
of
the
door
can
be
lost
yet
does
it
never
mingle
with
our
life
i
said
just
now
that
the
soul
changed
into
beauty
the
little
things
we
gave
to
it
it
would
even
seem
the
more
we
think
of
it
that
the
soul
has
no
other
reason
for
existence
and
that
all
its
activity
is
consumed
in
amassing
at
the
depths
of
us
a
treasure
of
indescribable
beauty
might
not
everything
naturally
turn
into
beauty
were
we
not
unceasingly
interrupting
the
arduous
labors
of
our
soul
does
not
evil
itself
become
precious
so
soon
as
it
has
gathered
therefrom
the
deep
lying
diamond
of
repentance
the
acts
of
injustice
whereof
you
have
been
guilty
the
tears
you
have
caused
to
flow
will
not
these
end
too
by
becoming
so
much
radiance
and
love
in
your
soul
have
you
ever
cast
your
eyes
into
this
kingdom
of
purifying
flame
that
is
within
you
perhaps
a
great
wrong
may
have
been
done
you
the
act
itself
being
mean
and
disheartening
the
mode
of
action
of
the
basest
and
ugliness
wrapped
you
round
as
your
tears
fell
but
let
some
years
elapse
then
give
one
look
into
your
soul
and
tell
me
whether
beneath
the
recollection
of
that
act
you
see
not
something
that
is
already
purer
than
thought
an
indescribable
unnameable
force
that
has
nought
in
common
with
the
forces
of
this
world
a
mysterious
inexhaustible
spring
of
the
other
life
whereat
you
may
drink
for
the
rest
of
your
days
and
yet
will
you
have
rendered
no
assistance
to
the
untiring
queen
other
thoughts
will
have
filled
your
mind
and
it
will
be
without
your
knowledge
that
the
act
will
have
been
purified
in
the
silence
of
your
being
and
will
have
flown
into
the
precious
waters
that
lie
in
the
great
reservoir
of
truth
and
beauty
which
unlike
the
shallower
reservoir
of
true
or
beautiful
thoughts
has
an
ever
unruffled
surface
and
remains
for
all
time
out
of
reach
of
the
breath
of
life
emerson
tells
us
that
there
is
not
an
act
or
event
in
our
life
but
sooner
or
later
casts
off
its
outer
shell
and
bewilders
us
by
its
sudden
flights
from
the
very
depths
of
us
on
high
into
the
empyrean
and
this
is
true
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
emerson
had
foreseen
for
the
further
we
advance
in
these
regions
the
diviner
are
the
spheres
we
discover
we
can
form
no
adequate
conception
of
what
this
silent
activity
of
the
souls
that
surround
us
may
really
mean
perhaps
you
have
spoken
a
pure
word
to
one
of
your
fellows
by
whom
it
has
not
been
understood
you
look
upon
it
as
lost
and
dismiss
it
from
your
mind
but
one
day
peradventure
the
word
comes
up
again
extraordinarily
transformed
and
revealing
the
unexpected
fruit
it
has
borne
in
the
darkness
then
silence
once
more
falls
over
all
but
it
matters
not
we
have
learned
that
nothing
can
be
lost
in
the
soul
and
that
even
to
the
very
pettiest
there
come
moments
of
splendor
it
is
unmistakably
borne
home
to
us
that
even
the
unhappiest
and
the
most
destitute
of
men
have
at
the
depths
of
their
being
and
in
spite
of
themselves
a
treasure
of
beauty
that
they
can
not
despoil
they
have
but
to
acquire
the
habit
of
dipping
into
this
treasurer
it
suffices
not
that
beauty
should
keep
solitary
festival
in
life
it
has
to
become
a
festival
of
every
day
there
needs
no
great
effort
to
be
admitted
into
the
ranks
of
those
whose
eyes
no
longer
behold
earth
in
flower
and
sky
in
glory
in
infinitesimal
fragments
but
indeed
in
sublime
masses
and
i
speak
here
of
flowers
and
sky
that
are
purer
and
more
lasting
than
those
that
we
behold
thousands
of
channels
there
are
through
which
the
beauty
of
our
soul
may
sail
even
unto
our
thoughts
above
all
is
there
the
wonderful
central
channel
of
love
is
it
not
in
love
that
are
found
the
purest
elements
of
beauty
that
we
can
offer
to
the
soul
some
there
are
who
do
thus
in
beauty
love
each
other
and
to
love
thus
means
that
little
by
little
the
sense
of
ugliness
is
lost
that
eyes
are
closed
to
all
the
littlenesses
of
life
to
all
but
the
freshness
and
virginity
of
the
very
humblest
of
souls
loving
thus
we
have
no
longer
even
the
need
to
forgive
loving
thus
we
can
no
longer
have
anything
to
conceal
for
that
the
soul
transforms
all
things
into
beauty
it
is
to
behold
evil
in
so
far
only
as
it
purifies
indulgence
and
teaches
us
no
longer
to
confound
the
sinner
with
his
sin
loving
thus
do
we
raise
on
high
within
ourselves
all
those
about
us
who
have
attained
an
eminence
where
failure
has
become
impossible
heights
whence
a
paltry
action
has
so
far
to
fall
that
touching
earth
it
is
compelled
to
yield
up
its
diamond
soul
it
is
to
transform
though
all
unconsciously
the
feeblest
intention
that
hovers
about
us
into
illimitable
movement
it
is
to
summon
all
that
is
beautiful
in
earth
heaven
or
soul
to
the
banquet
of
love
loving
thus
we
do
indeed
exist
before
our
fellows
as
we
exist
before
god
it
means
that
the
least
gesture
will
call
forth
the
presence
of
the
soul
with
all
its
treasure
no
longer
is
there
need
of
death
disaster
or
tears
for
that
the
soul
shall
appear
a
smile
suffices
loving
thus
we
perceive
truth
in
happiness
as
profoundly
as
some
of
the
heroes
perceived
it
in
the
radiance
of
greatest
sorrow
it
means
that
the
beauty
that
turns
into
love
is
undistinguishable
from
the
love
that
turns
into
beauty
it
means
to
be
able
no
longer
to
tell
where
the
ray
of
a
star
leaves
off
and
the
kiss
of
an
ordinary
thought
begins
it
means
to
have
come
so
near
to
god
that
the
angels
possess
us
loving
thus
the
same
soul
will
have
been
so
beautified
by
us
all
that
it
will
become
little
by
little
the
unique
angel
mentioned
by
swedenborg
it
means
that
each
day
will
reveal
to
us
a
new
beauty
in
that
mysterious
angel
and
that
we
shall
walk
together
in
a
goodness
that
shall
ever
become
more
and
more
living
loftier
and
loftier
for
there
exists
also
a
lifeless
beauty
made
up
of
the
past
alone
but
the
veritable
love
renders
the
past
useless
and
its
approach
creates
a
boundless
future
of
goodness
without
disaster
and
without
tears
to
love
thus
is
but
to
free
one
soul
and
to
become
as
beautiful
as
the
soul
thus
freed
if
in
the
emotion
that
this
spectacle
can
not
fail
to
awaken
in
thee
says
the
great
plotinus
when
dealing
with
kindred
matters
and
of
all
the
intellects
known
to
me
that
of
plotinus
draws
the
nearest
to
the
divine
if
in
the
emotion
that
this
spectacle
can
not
fail
to
awaken
in
thee
thou
proclaimest
not
that
it
is
beautiful
and
if
plunging
thine
eyes
into
thyself
thou
dost
not
then
feel
the
charm
of
beauty
it
is
in
vain
that
thy
disposition
being
such
thou
shouldst
seek
the
intelligible
beauty
for
thou
wouldst
seek
it
only
with
that
which
is
ugly
and
impure
therefore
it
is
that
the
discourse
we
hold
here
is
not
addressed
to
all
men
but
if
thou
hast
recognized
beauty
within
thyself
see
that
thou
rise
to
the
recollection
of
the
intelligible
beauty
the
invisible
goodness
it
is
a
thing
said
to
me
one
evening
the
sage
i
had
chanced
to
meet
by
the
sea
shore
whereon
the
waves
were
breaking
almost
noiselessly
it
is
a
thing
that
we
scarcely
notice
that
none
seem
to
take
into
account
and
yet
do
i
conceive
it
to
be
one
of
the
forces
that
safeguard
mankind
in
a
thousand
diverse
ways
do
the
gods
from
whom
we
spring
reveal
themselves
within
us
but
it
may
well
be
that
this
unnoticed
secret
goodness
to
which
sufficiently
direct
allusion
has
never
yet
been
made
is
the
purest
token
of
their
eternal
life
whence
it
comes
we
know
not
it
is
there
in
its
simplicity
smiling
on
the
threshold
of
our
soul
and
those
in
whom
its
smiles
lies
deepest
or
shine
forth
most
frequently
may
make
us
suffer
day
and
night
and
they
will
yet
shall
it
be
beyond
our
power
to
cease
to
love
them
it
is
not
of
this
world
and
still
are
there
few
agitations
of
ours
in
which
it
takes
not
part
it
cares
not
to
reveal
itself
even
in
look
or
tear
nay
it
seeks
concealment
for
reasons
one
can
not
divine
it
is
as
though
it
were
afraid
to
make
use
of
its
power
it
knows
that
its
most
involuntary
movement
will
cause
immortal
things
to
spring
to
life
about
it
and
we
are
miserly
with
immortal
things
why
are
we
so
fearful
lest
we
exhaust
the
heaven
within
us
we
dare
not
act
upon
the
whisper
of
the
god
who
inspires
us
we
are
afraid
of
everything
that
can
not
be
explained
by
word
or
gesture
and
we
shut
our
eyes
to
all
that
we
do
ourselves
notwithstanding
in
the
empire
where
explanations
are
vain
whence
comes
the
timidity
of
the
divine
in
man
for
truly
might
it
be
said
that
the
nearer
a
movement
of
our
soul
approaches
the
divine
so
much
the
more
scrupulously
do
we
conceal
it
from
the
eyes
of
our
brethren
can
it
be
that
man
is
nothing
but
a
frightened
god
or
has
the
command
been
laid
upon
us
that
the
superior
powers
must
not
be
betrayed
upon
all
that
does
not
form
part
of
this
too
visible
world
there
rests
the
tender
meekness
of
the
little
ailing
girl
for
whom
her
mother
will
not
send
when
strangers
come
to
the
house
and
therefore
it
is
that
this
secret
goodness
of
ours
has
never
yet
passed
through
the
silent
portals
of
our
soul
it
lives
within
us
like
a
prisoner
forbidden
to
approach
the
barred
window
of
her
cell
but
indeed
what
matter
though
it
do
not
approach
enough
that
it
be
there
hide
as
it
may
let
it
but
raise
its
head
move
a
link
of
its
chain
or
open
its
hand
and
the
prison
is
illumined
the
pressure
of
radiance
from
within
bursts
open
the
iron
barrier
and
then
suddenly
there
yawns
a
gulf
between
words
and
beings
a
gulf
peopled
with
agitated
angels
silence
falls
over
all
the
eyes
turn
away
for
a
moment
and
two
souls
embrace
tearfully
on
the
threshold
it
is
not
a
thing
that
comes
from
this
earth
of
ours
and
all
descriptions
can
be
of
no
avail
they
who
would
understand
must
have
in
themselves
too
the
same
point
of
sensibility
if
you
have
never
in
your
life
felt
the
power
of
your
invisible
goodness
go
no
further
it
would
be
useless
but
are
there
really
any
who
have
not
felt
this
power
and
have
the
worst
of
us
never
been
invisibly
good
i
know
not
of
so
many
in
this
world
does
the
aim
seem
to
be
the
discouragement
of
the
divine
in
their
soul
and
yet
there
needs
but
one
instant
of
respite
for
the
divine
to
spring
up
again
and
even
the
wickedest
are
not
incessantly
on
their
guard
and
hence
doubtless
has
it
arisen
that
so
many
of
the
wicked
are
good
unseen
of
all
whereas
divers
saints
and
sages
are
not
invisibly
good
more
than
once
have
i
been
the
cause
of
suffering
he
went
on
even
as
each
being
is
the
cause
of
suffering
about
him
i
have
caused
suffering
because
we
are
in
a
world
where
all
is
held
together
by
invisible
threads
in
a
world
where
none
are
alone
and
where
the
gentlest
gesture
of
love
or
kindliness
may
so
often
wound
the
innocence
by
our
side
i
have
caused
suffering
too
because
there
are
times
when
the
best
and
tenderest
are
impelled
to
seek
i
know
not
what
part
of
themselves
in
the
grief
of
others
for
indeed
there
are
seeds
that
only
spring
up
in
our
soul
beneath
the
rain
of
tears
shed
because
of
us
and
none
the
less
do
these
seeds
produce
good
flowers
and
salutary
fruit
what
would
you
it
is
no
law
of
our
making
and
i
know
not
whether
i
would
dare
to
love
the
man
who
had
made
no
one
weep
frequently
indeed
will
the
greatest
suffering
be
caused
by
those
whose
love
is
greatest
for
a
strange
timid
tender
cruelty
is
most
often
the
anxious
sister
of
love
on
all
sides
does
love
search
for
the
proofs
of
love
and
the
first
proofs
who
is
not
prone
to
discover
them
in
the
tears
of
the
beloved
even
death
could
not
suffice
to
reassure
the
lover
who
dared
to
give
ear
to
the
unreasoning
claims
of
love
for
to
the
intimate
cruelty
of
love
the
instant
of
death
seems
too
brief
over
beyond
death
there
is
yet
room
for
a
sea
of
doubts
and
even
in
those
who
die
together
may
disquiet
still
linger
as
they
die
long
slowly
falling
tears
are
needed
here
grief
is
love
first
food
and
every
love
that
has
not
been
fed
on
a
little
pure
suffering
must
die
like
the
babe
that
one
had
tried
to
nourish
on
the
nourishment
of
a
man
will
the
love
inspired
by
the
woman
who
always
brought
the
smile
to
your
lips
be
quite
the
same
as
the
love
you
feel
for
her
who
at
times
called
forth
your
tears
alas
needs
must
love
weep
and
often
indeed
is
it
at
the
very
moment
when
the
sobs
burst
forth
that
love
chains
are
forged
and
tempered
for
life
thus
he
continued
i
have
caused
suffering
because
i
loved
and
also
have
i
caused
suffering
because
i
did
not
love
but
how
great
was
the
difference
in
the
two
cases
in
the
one
the
slowly
dropping
tears
of
love
seemed
already
to
know
at
the
depths
of
them
that
they
were
bedewing
all
that
was
ineffable
in
our
united
souls
in
the
other
the
poor
tears
knew
that
they
were
falling
in
solitude
on
a
desert
but
it
is
at
those
very
moments
when
the
soul
is
all
ear
or
haply
all
soul
that
i
have
recognized
the
might
of
an
invisible
goodness
that
could
offer
to
the
wretched
tears
of
an
expiring
love
the
divine
illusions
of
a
love
on
the
eve
of
birth
has
there
never
come
to
you
one
of
those
sorrowful
evenings
when
dejection
lay
heavy
upon
your
unsmiling
kisses
and
it
at
length
dawned
upon
your
soul
that
it
had
been
mistaken
with
direst
difficulty
did
your
words
ring
forth
in
the
cold
air
of
the
separation
that
was
to
be
final
you
were
about
to
part
for
ever
and
your
almost
lifeless
hands
were
outstretched
for
the
farewell
of
a
departure
that
should
know
no
return
when
suddenly
your
soul
made
an
imperceptible
movement
within
itself
on
that
instant
did
the
soul
by
the
side
of
you
awake
on
the
summits
of
its
being
something
sprang
to
life
in
regions
loftier
far
than
the
love
of
jaded
lovers
and
for
all
that
the
bodies
might
shrink
asunder
henceforth
would
the
souls
never
forget
that
for
an
instant
they
had
beheld
each
other
high
above
mountains
they
had
never
seen
and
that
for
a
second
space
they
had
been
good
with
a
goodness
they
had
never
known
until
that
day
what
can
this
be
this
mysterious
movement
that
i
speak
of
here
in
connection
with
love
only
but
which
may
well
take
place
in
the
smallest
events
of
life
is
it
i
know
not
what
sacrifice
or
inner
embrace
is
it
the
profoundest
desire
to
be
soul
for
a
soul
or
the
consciousness
ever
quickening
within
us
of
the
presence
of
a
life
that
is
invisible
but
equal
to
our
own
is
it
all
that
is
admirable
and
sorrowful
in
the
mere
act
of
living
that
at
such
moments
floods
our
being
is
it
the
aspect
of
life
one
and
indivisible
i
know
not
but
in
truth
it
is
then
that
we
feel
that
there
lurks
somewhere
an
unknown
force
it
is
then
that
we
feel
that
we
are
the
treasures
of
an
unknown
god
who
loves
all
that
not
a
gesture
of
this
god
may
pass
unperceived
and
that
we
are
at
length
in
the
regions
of
things
that
do
not
betray
themselves
certain
it
is
that
from
the
day
of
our
birth
to
the
day
of
our
death
we
never
emerge
from
this
clearly
defined
region
but
wander
in
god
like
helpless
or
like
the
blind
who
despairingly
seek
the
very
temple
in
which
they
do
indeed
befind
themselves
we
are
there
in
life
man
against
man
soul
against
soul
and
day
and
night
are
spent
under
arms
we
never
see
each
other
we
never
touch
each
other
we
see
nothing
but
bucklers
and
helmets
we
touch
nothing
but
iron
and
brass
but
let
a
tiny
circumstance
come
from
the
simpleness
of
the
sky
for
one
instant
only
cause
the
weapons
to
fall
are
there
not
always
tears
beneath
the
helmet
childlike
smiles
behind
the
buckler
and
is
not
another
verity
revealed
he
thought
for
a
moment
then
went
on
more
sadly
a
woman
as
i
believe
i
told
you
just
now
a
woman
to
whom
i
had
caused
suffering
against
my
will
for
the
most
careful
of
us
scatter
suffering
around
them
without
their
knowledge
a
woman
to
whom
i
had
caused
suffering
against
my
will
revealed
to
me
one
evening
the
sovereign
power
of
this
invisible
good
to
be
good
we
must
needs
have
suffered
but
perhaps
it
is
necessary
to
have
caused
suffering
before
we
can
become
better
this
was
brought
home
to
me
that
evening
i
felt
that
i
had
arrived
alone
at
that
sad
zone
of
kisses
when
it
seems
to
us
that
we
are
visiting
the
hovels
of
the
poor
while
she
who
had
lingered
on
the
road
was
still
smiling
in
the
palace
of
the
first
days
love
as
men
understand
it
was
dying
between
us
like
a
child
stricken
with
a
disease
come
one
knows
not
whence
a
disease
that
has
no
pity
we
said
nothing
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
recall
what
my
thoughts
were
at
that
earnest
moment
they
were
doubtless
of
no
significance
i
was
probably
thinking
of
the
last
face
i
had
seen
of
the
quivering
gleam
of
a
lantern
at
a
deserted
street
corner
and
nevertheless
everything
took
place
in
a
light
a
thousand
times
purer
a
thousand
times
higher
than
had
there
intervened
all
the
forces
of
pity
and
love
which
i
command
in
my
thoughts
and
my
heart
we
parted
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
but
at
one
and
the
same
moment
had
we
understood
our
inexpressible
thought
we
know
now
that
another
love
had
sprung
to
life
a
love
that
demands
not
the
words
the
little
attentions
and
smiles
of
ordinary
love
we
have
never
met
again
perhaps
centuries
will
elapse
before
we
ever
do
meet
again
much
is
to
learn
much
to
forget
through
worlds
i
shall
traverse
not
a
few
before
we
shall
again
find
ourselves
in
the
same
movement
of
the
soul
as
on
that
evening
but
we
can
well
afford
to
wait
and
thus
ever
since
that
day
have
i
greeted
in
all
places
even
in
the
very
bitterest
of
moments
the
beneficent
presence
of
this
marvellous
power
he
who
has
but
once
clearly
seen
it
shall
never
again
find
it
possible
to
turn
away
from
its
face
you
will
often
behold
it
smiling
in
the
last
retreat
of
hatred
in
the
depths
of
the
cruellest
tears
and
yet
does
it
not
reveal
itself
to
the
eyes
of
the
body
its
nature
changes
from
the
moment
that
it
manifests
itself
by
means
of
an
exterior
act
and
we
are
no
longer
in
the
truth
according
to
the
soul
but
in
a
kind
of
falsehood
as
conceived
by
man
goodness
and
love
that
are
have
no
influence
on
the
soul
for
they
have
departed
from
the
kingdoms
where
they
have
their
dwelling
but
do
they
only
remain
blind
they
can
soften
destiny
itself
i
have
known
more
than
one
man
who
performed
every
act
of
kindness
and
mercy
without
touching
a
single
soul
and
i
have
known
others
who
seemed
to
live
in
falsehood
and
injustice
yet
were
no
souls
driven
from
them
nor
did
any
for
an
instant
even
believe
that
these
men
were
not
good
nay
more
even
those
who
do
not
know
you
who
are
merely
told
of
your
acts
of
goodness
and
deeds
of
love
if
you
be
not
good
according
to
the
invisible
goodness
these
even
will
feel
that
something
is
lacking
and
they
will
never
be
touched
in
the
depths
of
their
being
one
might
almost
believe
that
there
exists
somewhere
a
place
where
all
is
weighed
in
the
presence
of
the
spirits
or
perhaps
out
yonder
the
other
side
of
the
night
a
reservoir
of
certitudes
whither
the
silent
herd
of
souls
flock
every
morning
to
slake
their
thirst
perhaps
we
do
not
yet
know
what
the
word
to
love
means
there
are
within
us
lives
in
which
we
love
unconsciously
to
love
thus
means
more
than
to
have
pity
to
make
inner
sacrifices
to
be
anxious
to
help
and
give
happiness
it
is
a
thing
that
lies
a
thousand
fathoms
deeper
where
our
softest
swiftest
strongest
words
can
not
reach
it
at
moments
we
might
believe
it
to
be
a
recollection
furtive
but
excessively
keen
of
the
great
primitive
unity
there
is
in
this
love
a
force
that
nothing
can
resist
which
of
us
and
he
question
himself
the
side
of
the
light
from
which
our
gaze
is
habitually
averted
which
of
us
but
will
find
in
himself
the
recollection
of
certain
strange
workings
of
this
force
which
of
us
when
by
the
side
of
the
most
ordinary
person
perhaps
but
has
suddenly
become
conscious
of
the
advent
of
something
that
none
had
summoned
was
it
the
soul
or
perhaps
life
that
had
turned
within
itself
like
a
sleeper
on
the
point
of
awakening
i
know
not
nor
did
you
know
and
no
one
spoke
of
it
but
you
did
not
separate
from
each
other
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
love
thus
is
to
love
according
to
the
soul
and
there
is
no
soul
that
does
not
respond
to
this
love
for
the
soul
of
man
is
a
guest
that
has
gone
hungry
these
centuries
back
and
never
has
it
to
be
summoned
twice
to
the
nuptial
feast
the
souls
of
all
our
brethren
are
ever
hovering
about
us
craving
for
a
caress
and
only
waiting
for
the
signal
but
how
many
beings
there
are
who
all
their
life
long
have
not
dared
make
such
a
signal
it
is
the
disaster
of
our
entire
existence
that
we
live
thus
away
from
our
soul
and
stand
in
such
dread
of
its
slightest
movement
did
we
but
allow
it
to
smile
frankly
in
its
silence
and
its
radiance
we
should
be
already
living
an
eternal
life
we
have
only
to
think
for
an
instant
how
much
it
succeeds
in
accomplishing
during
those
rare
moments
when
we
knock
off
its
chains
for
it
is
our
custom
to
enchain
it
as
though
it
were
distraught
what
it
does
in
love
for
instance
for
there
we
do
permit
it
at
times
to
approach
the
lattices
of
external
life
and
would
it
not
be
in
accordance
with
the
primal
truth
if
all
men
were
to
feel
that
they
were
face
to
face
with
each
other
even
as
the
woman
feels
with
the
man
she
loves
this
invisible
and
divine
goodness
of
which
i
only
speak
here
because
of
its
being
one
of
the
surest
and
nearest
signs
of
the
unceasing
activity
of
our
soul
this
invisible
and
divine
goodness
ennobles
in
decisive
fashion
all
that
it
has
unconsciously
touched
let
him
who
has
a
grievance
against
his
fellow
descend
into
himself
and
seek
out
whether
he
never
has
been
good
in
the
presence
of
that
fellow
for
myself
i
have
never
met
any
one
by
whose
side
i
have
felt
my
invisible
goodness
bestir
itself
without
he
has
become
at
that
very
instant
better
than
myself
be
good
at
the
depths
of
you
and
you
will
discover
that
those
who
surround
you
will
be
good
even
to
the
same
depths
nothing
responds
more
infallibly
to
the
secret
cry
of
goodness
than
the
secret
cry
of
goodness
that
is
near
while
you
are
actively
good
in
the
invisible
all
those
who
approach
you
will
unconsciously
do
things
that
they
could
not
do
by
the
side
of
any
other
man
therein
lies
a
force
that
has
no
name
a
spiritual
rivalry
that
knows
no
resistance
it
is
as
though
this
were
the
actual
place
where
is
the
sensitive
spot
of
our
soul
for
there
are
souls
that
seem
to
have
forgotten
their
existence
and
to
have
renounced
everything
that
enables
the
being
to
rise
but
once
touched
here
they
all
draw
themselves
erect
and
in
the
divine
plains
of
the
secret
goodness
the
most
humble
of
souls
can
not
endure
defeat
and
yet
it
is
possible
that
nothing
is
changing
in
the
life
one
sees
but
is
it
only
that
which
matters
and
is
our
existence
indeed
confined
to
actions
we
can
take
in
our
hand
like
stones
on
the
highroad
if
you
ask
yourself
as
we
are
told
we
should
ask
every
evening
what
of
immortal
have
i
done
is
it
always
on
the
material
side
that
we
can
count
weigh
and
measure
unerringly
is
it
there
that
you
must
begin
your
search
it
is
possible
for
you
to
cause
extraordinary
tears
to
flow
it
is
possible
that
you
may
fill
a
heart
with
certitudes
and
give
eternal
life
unto
a
soul
and
no
one
shall
know
of
it
nor
shall
you
even
know
yourself
it
may
be
that
nothing
is
changing
it
may
be
that
were
it
put
to
the
test
all
would
crumble
and
that
this
goodness
we
speak
of
would
yield
to
the
smallest
fear
it
matters
not
something
divine
has
happened
and
somewhere
must
our
god
have
smiled
may
it
not
be
the
supreme
aim
of
life
thus
to
bring
to
birth
the
inexplicable
within
ourselves
and
do
we
know
how
much
we
add
to
ourselves
when
we
awake
something
of
the
incomprehensible
that
slumbers
in
every
corner
here
you
have
awakened
love
which
will
not
fall
asleep
again
the
soul
that
your
soul
has
regarded
that
has
wept
with
you
the
holy
tears
of
the
solemn
joy
that
none
may
behold
will
bear
you
no
resentment
not
even
in
the
midst
of
torture
it
will
not
even
feel
the
need
of
forgiving
so
convinced
is
it
of
one
knows
not
what
that
nothing
can
henceforth
dim
or
efface
the
smile
that
it
wears
within
for
nothing
can
ever
separate
two
souls
which
for
an
instant
have
been
good
together
silence
as
we
advance
through
life
it
is
more
and
more
brought
home
to
us
that
nothing
takes
place
that
is
not
in
accord
with
some
curious
preconceived
design
and
of
this
we
never
breathe
a
word
we
scarcely
dare
to
let
our
minds
dwell
upon
it
but
of
its
existence
somewhere
above
our
heads
we
are
absolutely
convinced
the
most
fatuous
of
men
smiles
at
the
first
encounters
as
though
he
were
the
accomplice
of
the
destiny
of
his
brethren
and
in
this
domain
even
those
who
can
speak
the
most
profoundly
realise
they
perhaps
more
than
others
that
words
can
never
express
the
real
special
relationship
that
exists
between
two
beings
were
i
to
speak
to
you
at
this
moment
of
the
gravest
things
of
all
of
love
death
or
destiny
it
is
not
love
death
or
destiny
that
i
should
touch
and
my
efforts
notwithstanding
there
would
always
remain
between
us
a
truth
which
had
not
been
spoken
which
we
had
not
even
thought
of
speaking
and
yet
it
is
this
truth
only
voiceless
though
it
has
been
which
will
have
lived
with
us
for
an
instant
and
by
which
we
shall
have
been
wholly
absorbed
for
that
truth
was
our
truth
as
regards
death
destiny
or
love
and
it
was
in
silence
only
that
we
could
perceive
it
and
nothing
save
only
the
silence
will
have
had
any
importance
my
sisters
says
a
child
in
the
you
have
each
of
you
a
secret
thought
i
wish
to
know
it
we
too
have
something
that
people
wish
to
know
but
it
is
hidden
far
above
the
secret
thought
it
is
our
secret
silence
but
all
questions
are
useless
when
our
spirit
is
alarmed
its
own
agitation
becomes
a
barrier
to
the
second
life
that
lives
in
this
secret
and
would
we
know
what
it
is
that
lies
hidden
there
we
must
cultivate
silence
among
ourselves
for
it
is
then
only
that
for
one
instant
the
eternal
flowers
unfold
their
petals
the
mysterious
flowers
whose
form
and
colour
are
ever
changing
in
harmony
with
the
soul
that
is
by
their
side
as
gold
and
silver
are
weighed
in
pure
water
so
does
the
soul
test
its
weight
in
silence
and
the
words
that
we
let
fall
have
no
meaning
apart
from
the
silence
that
wraps
them
round
if
i
tell
someone
that
i
love
him
as
i
may
have
told
a
hundred
others
my
words
will
convey
nothing
to
him
but
the
silence
which
will
ensue
if
i
do
indeed
love
him
will
make
clear
in
what
depths
lie
the
roots
of
my
love
and
will
in
its
turn
give
birth
to
a
conviction
that
shall
itself
be
silent
and
in
the
course
of
a
lifetime
this
silence
and
this
conviction
will
never
again
be
the
same
is
it
not
silence
that
determines
and
fixes
the
savour
of
love
deprived
of
it
love
would
lose
its
eternal
essence
and
perfume
who
has
not
known
those
silent
moments
which
separated
the
lips
to
reunite
the
souls
it
is
these
that
we
must
ever
seek
there
is
no
silence
more
docile
than
the
silence
of
love
and
it
is
indeed
the
only
one
that
we
may
claim
for
ourselves
alone
the
other
great
silences
those
of
death
grief
or
destiny
do
not
belong
to
us
they
come
towards
us
at
their
own
hour
following
in
the
track
of
events
and
those
whom
they
do
not
meet
need
not
reproach
themselves
but
we
can
all
go
forth
to
meet
the
silence
of
love
they
lie
in
wait
for
us
night
and
day
at
our
threshold
and
are
no
less
beautiful
than
their
brothers
and
it
is
thanks
to
them
that
those
who
have
seldom
wept
may
know
the
life
of
the
soul
almost
as
intimately
as
those
to
whom
much
grief
has
come
and
therefore
it
is
that
such
of
us
as
have
loved
deeply
have
learnt
many
secrets
that
are
unknown
to
others
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
things
quiver
in
silence
on
the
lips
of
true
friendship
and
love
that
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
silence
of
other
lips
to
which
friendship
and
love
are
unknown
