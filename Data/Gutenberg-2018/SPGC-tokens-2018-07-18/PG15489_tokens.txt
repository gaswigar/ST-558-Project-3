the
medical
profession
is
justly
conservative
human
life
should
not
be
considered
as
the
proper
material
for
wild
experiments
conservatism
however
is
too
often
a
welcome
excuse
for
lazy
minds
loath
to
adapt
themselves
to
fast
changing
conditions
remember
the
scornful
reception
which
first
was
accorded
to
discoveries
in
the
domain
of
the
unconscious
when
after
years
of
patient
observations
he
finally
decided
to
appear
before
medical
bodies
to
tell
them
modestly
of
some
facts
which
always
recurred
in
his
dream
and
his
patients
dreams
he
was
first
laughed
at
and
then
avoided
as
a
crank
the
words
dream
interpretation
were
and
still
are
indeed
fraught
with
unpleasant
unscientific
associations
they
remind
one
of
all
sorts
of
childish
superstitious
notions
which
make
up
the
thread
and
woof
of
dream
books
read
by
none
but
the
ignorant
and
the
primitive
the
wealth
of
detail
the
infinite
care
never
to
let
anything
pass
unexplained
with
which
he
presented
to
the
public
the
result
of
his
investigations
are
impressing
more
and
more
scientists
but
the
examination
of
his
evidential
data
demands
arduous
work
and
presupposes
an
absolutely
open
mind
this
is
why
we
still
encounter
men
totally
unfamiliar
with
writings
men
who
were
not
even
interested
enough
in
the
subject
to
attempt
an
interpretation
of
their
dreams
or
their
patients
dreams
deriding
freud
theories
and
combatting
them
with
the
help
of
statements
which
he
never
made
some
of
them
like
professor
boris
sidis
reach
at
times
conclusions
which
are
strangely
similar
to
freud
but
in
their
ignorance
of
psychoanalytic
literature
they
fail
to
credit
freud
for
observations
antedating
theirs
besides
those
who
sneer
at
dream
study
because
they
have
never
looked
into
the
subject
there
are
those
who
do
not
dare
to
face
the
facts
revealed
by
dream
study
dreams
tell
us
many
an
unpleasant
biological
truth
about
ourselves
and
only
very
free
minds
can
thrive
on
such
a
diet
is
a
plant
which
withers
fast
in
the
pellucid
atmosphere
of
dream
investigation
the
weakling
and
the
neurotic
attached
to
his
neurosis
are
not
anxious
to
turn
such
a
powerful
searchlight
upon
the
dark
corners
of
their
psychology
freud
theories
are
anything
but
theoretical
he
was
moved
by
the
fact
that
there
always
seemed
to
be
a
close
connection
between
his
patients
dreams
and
their
mental
abnormalities
to
collect
thousands
of
dreams
and
to
compare
them
with
the
case
histories
in
his
possession
he
did
not
start
out
with
a
preconceived
bias
hoping
to
find
evidence
which
might
support
his
views
he
looked
at
facts
a
thousand
times
until
they
began
to
tell
him
something
his
attitude
toward
dream
study
was
in
other
words
that
of
a
statistician
who
does
not
know
and
has
no
means
of
foreseeing
what
conclusions
will
be
forced
on
him
by
the
information
he
is
gathering
but
who
is
fully
prepared
to
accept
those
unavoidable
conclusions
this
was
indeed
a
novel
way
in
psychology
psychologists
had
always
been
wont
to
build
in
what
bleuler
calls
autistic
ways
that
is
through
methods
in
no
wise
supported
by
evidence
some
attractive
hypothesis
which
sprung
from
their
brain
like
minerva
from
jove
brain
fully
armed
after
which
they
would
stretch
upon
that
unyielding
frame
the
hide
of
a
reality
which
they
had
previously
killed
it
is
only
to
minds
suffering
from
the
same
distortions
to
minds
also
autistically
inclined
that
those
empty
artificial
structures
appear
acceptable
molds
for
philosophic
thinking
the
pragmatic
view
that
truth
is
what
works
had
not
been
as
yet
expressed
when
freud
published
his
revolutionary
views
on
the
psychology
of
dreams
five
facts
of
first
magnitude
were
made
obvious
to
the
world
by
his
interpretation
of
dreams
first
of
all
freud
pointed
out
a
constant
connection
between
some
part
of
every
dream
and
some
detail
of
the
dreamer
life
during
the
previous
waking
state
this
positively
establishes
a
relation
between
sleeping
states
and
waking
states
and
disposes
of
the
widely
prevalent
view
that
dreams
are
purely
nonsensical
phenomena
coming
from
nowhere
and
leading
nowhere
secondly
freud
after
studying
the
dreamer
life
and
modes
of
thought
after
noting
down
all
his
mannerisms
and
the
apparently
insignificant
details
of
his
conduct
which
reveal
his
secret
thoughts
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
in
every
dream
the
attempted
or
successful
gratification
of
some
wish
conscious
or
unconscious
thirdly
he
proved
that
many
of
our
dream
visions
are
symbolical
which
causes
us
to
consider
them
as
absurd
and
unintelligible
the
universality
of
those
symbols
however
makes
them
very
transparent
to
the
trained
observer
fourthly
freud
showed
that
sexual
desires
play
an
enormous
part
in
our
unconscious
a
part
which
puritanical
hypocrisy
has
always
tried
to
minimize
if
not
to
ignore
entirely
finally
freud
established
a
direct
connection
between
dreams
and
insanity
between
the
symbolic
visions
of
our
sleep
and
the
symbolic
actions
of
the
mentally
deranged
there
were
of
course
many
other
observations
which
freud
made
while
dissecting
the
dreams
of
his
patients
but
not
all
of
them
present
as
much
interest
as
the
foregoing
nor
were
they
as
revolutionary
or
likely
to
wield
as
much
influence
on
modern
psychiatry
other
explorers
have
struck
the
path
blazed
by
freud
and
leading
into
man
unconscious
jung
of
zurich
adler
of
vienna
and
kempf
of
washington
have
made
to
the
study
of
the
unconscious
contributions
which
have
brought
that
study
into
fields
which
freud
himself
never
dreamt
of
invading
one
fact
which
can
not
be
too
emphatically
stated
however
is
that
but
for
freud
wishfulfillment
theory
of
dreams
neither
jung
energic
theory
nor
adler
theory
of
organ
inferiority
and
compensation
nor
kempf
dynamic
mechanism
might
have
been
formulated
freud
is
the
father
of
modern
abnormal
psychology
and
he
established
the
psychoanalytical
point
of
view
no
one
who
is
not
well
grounded
in
freudian
lore
can
hope
to
achieve
any
work
of
value
in
the
field
of
psychoanalysis
on
the
other
hand
let
no
one
repeat
the
absurd
assertion
that
freudism
is
a
sort
of
religion
bounded
with
dogmas
and
requiring
an
act
of
faith
freudism
as
such
was
merely
a
stage
in
the
development
of
psychoanalysis
a
stage
out
of
which
all
but
a
few
bigoted
camp
followers
totally
lacking
in
originality
have
evolved
thousands
of
stones
have
been
added
to
the
structure
erected
by
the
viennese
physician
and
many
more
will
be
added
in
the
course
of
time
but
the
new
additions
to
that
structure
would
collapse
like
a
house
of
cards
but
for
the
original
foundations
which
are
as
indestructible
as
harvey
statement
as
to
the
circulation
of
the
blood
regardless
of
whatever
additions
or
changes
have
been
made
to
the
original
structure
the
analytic
point
of
view
remains
unchanged
that
point
of
view
is
not
only
revolutionising
all
the
methods
of
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
mental
derangements
but
compelling
the
intelligent
physician
to
revise
entirely
his
attitude
to
almost
every
kind
of
disease
the
insane
are
no
longer
absurd
and
pitiable
people
to
be
herded
in
asylums
till
nature
either
cures
them
or
relieves
them
through
death
of
their
misery
the
insane
who
have
not
been
made
so
by
actual
injury
to
their
brain
or
nervous
system
are
the
victims
of
unconscious
forces
which
cause
them
to
do
abnormally
things
which
they
might
be
helped
to
do
normally
insight
into
one
psychology
is
replacing
victoriously
sedatives
and
rest
cures
physicians
dealing
with
purely
physical
cases
have
begun
to
take
into
serious
consideration
the
mental
factors
which
have
predisposed
a
patient
to
certain
ailments
freud
views
have
also
made
a
revision
of
all
ethical
and
social
values
unavoidable
and
have
thrown
an
unexpected
flood
of
light
upon
literary
and
artistic
accomplishment
but
the
freudian
point
of
view
or
more
broadly
speaking
the
psychoanalytic
point
of
view
shall
ever
remain
a
puzzle
to
those
who
from
laziness
or
indifference
refuse
to
survey
with
the
great
viennese
the
field
over
which
he
carefully
groped
his
way
we
shall
never
be
convinced
until
we
repeat
under
his
guidance
all
his
laboratory
experiments
we
must
follow
him
through
the
thickets
of
the
unconscious
through
the
land
which
had
never
been
charted
because
academic
philosophers
following
the
line
of
least
effort
had
decided
that
it
could
not
be
charted
ancient
geographers
when
exhausting
their
store
of
information
about
distant
lands
yielded
to
an
unscientific
craving
for
romance
and
without
any
evidence
to
support
their
day
dreams
filled
the
blank
spaces
left
on
their
maps
by
unexplored
tracts
with
amusing
inserts
such
as
here
there
are
lions
thanks
to
freud
interpretation
of
dreams
the
royal
road
into
the
unconscious
is
now
open
to
all
explorers
they
shall
not
find
lions
they
shall
find
man
himself
and
the
record
of
all
his
life
and
of
his
struggle
with
reality
and
it
is
only
after
seeing
man
as
his
unconscious
revealed
by
his
dreams
presents
him
to
us
that
we
shall
understand
him
fully
for
as
freud
said
to
putnam
we
are
what
we
are
because
we
have
been
what
we
have
been
not
a
few
students
however
have
been
discouraged
from
attempting
a
study
of
freud
dream
psychology
the
book
in
which
he
originally
offered
to
the
world
his
interpretation
of
dreams
was
as
circumstantial
as
a
legal
record
to
be
pondered
over
by
scientists
at
their
leisure
not
to
be
assimilated
in
a
few
hours
by
the
average
alert
reader
in
those
days
freud
could
not
leave
out
any
detail
likely
to
make
his
extremely
novel
thesis
evidentially
acceptable
to
those
willing
to
sift
data
freud
himself
however
realized
the
magnitude
of
the
task
which
the
reading
of
his
imposed
upon
those
who
have
not
been
prepared
for
it
by
long
psychological
and
scientific
training
and
he
abstracted
from
that
gigantic
work
the
parts
which
constitute
the
essential
of
his
discoveries
the
publishers
of
the
present
book
deserve
credit
for
presenting
to
the
reading
public
the
gist
of
freud
psychology
in
the
master
own
words
and
in
a
form
which
shall
neither
discourage
beginners
nor
appear
too
elementary
to
those
who
are
more
advanced
in
psychoanalytic
study
dream
psychology
is
the
key
to
freud
works
and
to
all
modern
psychology
with
a
simple
compact
manual
such
as
there
shall
be
no
longer
any
excuse
for
ignorance
of
the
most
revolutionary
psychological
system
of
modern
times

dreams
have
a
meaning
in
what
we
may
term
prescientific
days
people
were
in
no
uncertainty
about
the
interpretation
of
dreams
when
they
were
recalled
after
awakening
they
were
regarded
as
either
the
friendly
or
hostile
manifestation
of
some
higher
powers
demoniacal
and
divine
with
the
rise
of
scientific
thought
the
whole
of
this
expressive
mythology
was
transferred
to
psychology
there
is
but
a
small
minority
among
educated
persons
who
doubt
that
the
dream
is
the
dreamer
own
psychical
act
but
since
the
downfall
of
the
mythological
hypothesis
an
interpretation
of
the
dream
has
been
wanting
the
conditions
of
its
origin
its
relationship
to
our
psychical
life
when
we
are
awake
its
independence
of
disturbances
which
during
the
state
of
sleep
seem
to
compel
notice
its
many
peculiarities
repugnant
to
our
waking
thought
the
incongruence
between
its
images
and
the
feelings
they
engender
then
the
evanescence
the
way
in
which
on
awakening
our
thoughts
thrust
it
aside
as
something
bizarre
and
our
reminiscences
mutilating
or
rejecting
it
all
these
and
many
other
problems
have
for
many
hundred
years
demanded
answers
which
up
till
now
could
never
have
been
satisfactory
before
all
there
is
the
question
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
dream
a
question
which
is
in
itself
there
is
firstly
the
psychical
significance
of
the
dream
its
position
with
regard
to
the
psychical
processes
as
to
a
possible
biological
function
secondly
has
the
dream
a
meaning
can
sense
be
made
of
each
single
dream
as
of
other
mental
syntheses
three
tendencies
can
be
observed
in
the
estimation
of
dreams
many
philosophers
have
given
currency
to
one
of
these
tendencies
one
which
at
the
same
time
preserves
something
of
the
dream
former
the
foundation
of
dream
life
is
for
them
a
peculiar
state
of
psychical
activity
which
they
even
celebrate
as
elevation
to
some
higher
state
schubert
for
instance
claims
the
dream
is
the
liberation
of
the
spirit
from
the
pressure
of
external
nature
a
detachment
of
the
soul
from
the
fetters
of
matter
not
all
go
so
far
as
this
but
many
maintain
that
dreams
have
their
origin
in
real
spiritual
excitations
and
are
the
outward
manifestations
of
spiritual
powers
whose
free
movements
have
been
hampered
during
the
day
dream
phantasies
scherner
volkelt
a
large
number
of
observers
acknowledge
that
dream
life
is
capable
of
extraordinary
achievements
at
any
rate
in
certain
fields
memory
in
striking
contradiction
with
this
the
majority
of
medical
writers
hardly
admit
that
the
dream
is
a
psychical
phenomenon
at
all
according
to
them
dreams
are
provoked
and
initiated
exclusively
by
stimuli
proceeding
from
the
senses
or
the
body
which
either
reach
the
sleeper
from
without
or
are
accidental
disturbances
of
his
internal
organs
the
dream
has
no
greater
claim
to
meaning
and
importance
than
the
sound
called
forth
by
the
ten
fingers
of
a
person
quite
unacquainted
with
music
running
his
fingers
over
the
keys
of
an
instrument
the
dream
is
to
be
regarded
says
binz
as
a
physical
process
always
useless
frequently
morbid
all
the
peculiarities
of
dream
life
are
explicable
as
the
incoherent
effort
due
to
some
physiological
stimulus
of
certain
organs
or
of
the
cortical
elements
of
a
brain
otherwise
asleep
but
slightly
affected
by
scientific
opinion
and
untroubled
as
to
the
origin
of
dreams
the
popular
view
holds
firmly
to
the
belief
that
dreams
really
have
got
a
meaning
in
some
way
they
do
foretell
the
future
whilst
the
meaning
can
be
unravelled
in
some
way
or
other
from
its
oft
bizarre
and
enigmatical
content
the
reading
of
dreams
consists
in
replacing
the
events
of
the
dream
so
far
as
remembered
by
other
events
this
is
done
either
scene
by
scene
to
some
rigid
or
the
dream
as
a
whole
is
replaced
by
something
else
of
which
it
was
a
persons
laugh
at
these
efforts
dreams
are
but
one
day
i
discovered
to
my
amazement
that
the
popular
view
grounded
in
superstition
and
not
the
medical
one
comes
nearer
to
the
truth
about
dreams
i
arrived
at
new
conclusions
about
dreams
by
the
use
of
a
new
method
of
psychological
investigation
one
which
had
rendered
me
good
service
in
the
investigation
of
phobias
obsessions
illusions
and
the
like
and
which
under
the
name
had
found
acceptance
by
a
whole
school
of
investigators
the
manifold
analogies
of
dream
life
with
the
most
diverse
conditions
of
psychical
disease
in
the
waking
state
have
been
rightly
insisted
upon
by
a
number
of
medical
observers
it
seemed
therefore
hopeful
to
apply
to
the
interpretation
of
dreams
methods
of
investigation
which
had
been
tested
in
psychopathological
processes
obsessions
and
those
peculiar
sensations
of
haunting
dread
remain
as
strange
to
normal
consciousness
as
do
dreams
to
our
waking
consciousness
their
origin
is
as
unknown
to
consciousness
as
is
that
of
dreams
it
was
practical
ends
that
impelled
us
in
these
diseases
to
fathom
their
origin
and
formation
experience
had
shown
us
that
a
cure
and
a
consequent
mastery
of
the
obsessing
ideas
did
result
when
once
those
thoughts
the
connecting
links
between
the
morbid
ideas
and
the
rest
of
the
psychical
content
were
revealed
which
were
heretofore
veiled
from
consciousness
the
procedure
i
employed
for
the
interpretation
of
dreams
thus
arose
from
psychotherapy
this
procedure
is
readily
described
although
its
practice
demands
instruction
and
experience
suppose
the
patient
is
suffering
from
intense
morbid
dread
he
is
requested
to
direct
his
attention
to
the
idea
in
question
without
however
as
he
has
so
frequently
done
meditating
upon
it
every
impression
about
it
without
any
exception
which
occurs
to
him
should
be
imparted
to
the
doctor
the
statement
which
will
be
perhaps
then
made
that
he
can
not
concentrate
his
attention
upon
anything
at
all
is
to
be
countered
by
assuring
him
most
positively
that
such
a
blank
state
of
mind
is
utterly
impossible
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
great
number
of
impressions
will
soon
occur
with
which
others
will
associate
themselves
these
will
be
invariably
accompanied
by
the
expression
of
the
observer
opinion
that
they
have
no
meaning
or
are
unimportant
it
will
be
at
once
noticed
that
it
is
this
which
prevented
the
patient
from
imparting
the
ideas
which
had
indeed
already
excluded
them
from
consciousness
if
the
patient
can
be
induced
to
abandon
this
and
to
pursue
the
trains
of
thought
which
are
yielded
by
concentrating
the
attention
most
significant
matter
will
be
obtained
matter
which
will
be
presently
seen
to
be
clearly
linked
to
the
morbid
idea
in
question
its
connection
with
other
ideas
will
be
manifest
and
later
on
will
permit
the
replacement
of
the
morbid
idea
by
a
fresh
one
which
is
perfectly
adapted
to
psychical
continuity
this
is
not
the
place
to
examine
thoroughly
the
hypothesis
upon
which
this
experiment
rests
or
the
deductions
which
follow
from
its
invariable
success
it
must
suffice
to
state
that
we
obtain
matter
enough
for
the
resolution
of
every
morbid
idea
if
we
especially
direct
our
attention
to
the
associations
disturb
our
those
which
are
otherwise
put
aside
by
the
critic
as
worthless
refuse
if
the
procedure
is
exercised
on
oneself
the
best
plan
of
helping
the
experiment
is
to
write
down
at
once
all
one
first
indistinct
fancies
i
will
now
point
out
where
this
method
leads
when
i
apply
it
to
the
examination
of
dreams
any
dream
could
be
made
use
of
in
this
way
from
certain
motives
i
however
choose
a
dream
of
my
own
which
appears
confused
and
meaningless
to
my
memory
and
one
which
has
the
advantage
of
brevity
probably
my
dream
of
last
night
satisfies
the
requirements
its
content
fixed
immediately
after
awakening
runs
as
follows
company
at
table
or
table
spinach
is
served
sitting
next
to
me
gives
me
her
undivided
attention
and
places
her
hand
familiarly
upon
my
knee
in
defence
i
remove
her
hand
then
she
says
you
have
always
had
such
beautiful
i
then
distinctly
see
something
like
two
eyes
as
a
sketch
or
as
the
contour
of
a
spectacle
lens
this
is
the
whole
dream
or
at
all
events
all
that
i
can
remember
it
appears
to
me
not
only
obscure
and
meaningless
but
more
especially
odd
is
a
person
with
whom
i
am
scarcely
on
visiting
terms
nor
to
my
knowledge
have
i
ever
desired
any
more
cordial
relationship
i
have
not
seen
her
for
a
long
time
and
do
not
think
there
was
any
mention
of
her
recently
no
emotion
whatever
accompanied
the
dream
process
reflecting
upon
this
dream
does
not
make
it
a
bit
clearer
to
my
mind
i
will
now
however
present
the
ideas
without
premeditation
and
without
criticism
which
introspection
yielded
i
soon
notice
that
it
is
an
advantage
to
break
up
the
dream
into
its
elements
and
to
search
out
the
ideas
which
link
themselves
to
each
fragment
at
table
or
table
the
recollection
of
the
slight
event
with
which
the
evening
of
yesterday
ended
is
at
once
called
up
i
left
a
small
party
in
the
company
of
a
friend
who
offered
to
drive
me
home
in
his
cab
i
prefer
a
taxi
he
said
that
gives
one
such
a
pleasant
occupation
there
is
always
something
to
look
at
when
we
were
in
the
cab
and
the
turned
the
disc
so
that
the
first
sixty
hellers
were
visible
i
continued
the
jest
we
have
hardly
got
in
and
we
already
owe
sixty
hellers
the
taxi
always
reminds
me
of
the
table
it
makes
me
avaricious
and
selfish
by
continuously
reminding
me
of
my
debt
it
seems
to
me
to
mount
up
too
quickly
and
i
am
always
afraid
that
i
shall
be
at
a
disadvantage
just
as
i
can
not
resist
at
table
the
comical
fear
that
i
am
getting
too
little
that
i
must
look
after
myself
in
connection
with
this
i
quote
to
earth
this
weary
earth
ye
bring
us
to
guilt
ye
let
us
heedless
go
another
idea
about
the
table
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
very
cross
with
my
dear
wife
at
the
at
a
tyrolese
health
resort
because
she
was
not
sufficiently
reserved
with
some
neighbors
with
whom
i
wished
to
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
i
begged
her
to
occupy
herself
rather
with
me
than
with
the
strangers
that
is
just
as
if
i
had
at
a
disadvantage
at
the
table
the
contrast
between
the
behavior
of
my
wife
at
the
table
and
that
of
in
the
dream
now
strikes
me
addresses
herself
entirely
to
me
further
i
now
notice
that
the
dream
is
the
reproduction
of
a
little
scene
which
transpired
between
my
wife
and
myself
when
i
was
secretly
courting
her
the
caressing
under
cover
of
the
tablecloth
was
an
answer
to
a
wooer
passionate
letter
in
the
dream
however
my
wife
is
replaced
by
the
unfamiliar
is
the
daughter
of
a
man
to
whom
i
i
can
not
help
noticing
that
here
there
is
revealed
an
unsuspected
connection
between
the
dream
content
and
my
thoughts
if
the
chain
of
associations
be
followed
up
which
proceeds
from
one
element
of
the
dream
one
is
soon
led
back
to
another
of
its
elements
the
thoughts
evoked
by
the
dream
stir
up
associations
which
were
not
noticeable
in
the
dream
itself
is
it
not
customary
when
some
one
expects
others
to
look
after
his
interests
without
any
advantage
to
themselves
to
ask
the
innocent
question
satirically
do
you
think
this
will
be
done
the
sake
of
your
beautiful
hence
speech
in
the
dream
you
have
always
had
such
beautiful
eyes
means
nothing
but
people
always
do
everything
to
you
for
love
of
you
you
have
had
for
the
contrary
is
of
course
the
truth
i
have
always
paid
dearly
for
whatever
kindness
others
have
shown
me
still
the
fact
that
had
a
ride
for
yesterday
when
my
friend
drove
me
home
in
his
cab
must
have
made
an
impression
upon
me
in
any
case
the
friend
whose
guests
we
were
yesterday
has
often
made
me
his
debtor
recently
i
allowed
an
opportunity
of
requiting
him
to
go
by
he
has
had
only
one
present
from
me
an
antique
shawl
upon
which
eyes
are
painted
all
round
a
occhiale
as
a
against
the
moreover
he
is
an
that
same
evening
i
had
asked
him
after
a
patient
whom
i
had
sent
to
him
for
as
i
remarked
nearly
all
parts
of
the
dream
have
been
brought
into
this
new
connection
i
still
might
ask
why
in
the
dream
it
was
that
was
served
up
because
spinach
called
up
a
little
scene
which
recently
occurred
at
our
table
a
child
whose
are
really
deserving
of
praise
refused
to
eat
spinach
as
a
child
i
was
just
the
same
for
a
long
time
i
loathed
until
in
later
life
my
tastes
altered
and
it
became
one
of
my
favorite
dishes
the
mention
of
this
dish
brings
my
own
childhood
and
that
of
my
child
near
together
you
should
be
glad
that
you
have
some
spinach
his
mother
had
said
to
the
little
gourmet
some
children
would
be
very
glad
to
get
spinach
thus
i
am
reminded
of
the
parents
duties
towards
their
children
goethe
words
to
earth
this
weary
earth
ye
bring
us
to
guilt
ye
let
us
heedless
go
take
on
another
meaning
in
this
connection
here
i
will
stop
in
order
that
i
may
recapitulate
the
results
of
the
analysis
of
the
dream
by
following
the
associations
which
were
linked
to
the
single
elements
of
the
dream
torn
from
their
context
i
have
been
led
to
a
series
of
thoughts
and
reminiscences
where
i
am
bound
to
recognize
interesting
expressions
of
my
psychical
life
the
matter
yielded
by
an
analysis
of
the
dream
stands
in
intimate
relationship
with
the
dream
content
but
this
relationship
is
so
special
that
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
have
inferred
the
new
discoveries
directly
from
the
dream
itself
the
dream
was
passionless
disconnected
and
unintelligible
during
the
time
that
i
am
unfolding
the
thoughts
at
the
back
of
the
dream
i
feel
intense
and
emotions
the
thoughts
themselves
fit
beautifully
together
into
chains
logically
bound
together
with
certain
central
ideas
which
ever
repeat
themselves
such
ideas
not
represented
in
the
dream
itself
are
in
this
instance
the
antitheses
unselfish
to
be
indebted
to
work
for
i
could
draw
closer
the
threads
of
the
web
which
analysis
has
disclosed
and
would
then
be
able
to
show
how
they
all
run
together
into
a
single
knot
i
am
debarred
from
making
this
work
public
by
considerations
of
a
private
not
of
a
scientific
nature
after
having
cleared
up
many
things
which
i
do
not
willingly
acknowledge
as
mine
i
should
have
much
to
reveal
which
had
better
remain
my
secret
why
then
do
not
i
choose
another
dream
whose
analysis
would
be
more
suitable
for
publication
so
that
i
could
awaken
a
fairer
conviction
of
the
sense
and
cohesion
of
the
results
disclosed
by
analysis
the
answer
is
because
every
dream
which
i
investigate
leads
to
the
same
difficulties
and
places
me
under
the
same
need
of
discretion
nor
should
i
forgo
this
difficulty
any
the
more
were
i
to
analyze
the
dream
of
some
one
else
that
could
only
be
done
when
opportunity
allowed
all
concealment
to
be
dropped
without
injury
to
those
who
trusted
me
the
conclusion
which
is
now
forced
upon
me
is
that
the
dream
is
a
of
for
those
emotional
and
intellectual
trains
of
thought
which
i
attained
after
complete
analysis
i
do
not
yet
know
the
process
by
which
the
dream
arose
from
those
thoughts
but
i
perceive
that
it
is
wrong
to
regard
the
dream
as
psychically
unimportant
a
purely
physical
process
which
has
arisen
from
the
activity
of
isolated
cortical
elements
awakened
out
of
sleep
i
must
further
remark
that
the
dream
is
far
shorter
than
the
thoughts
which
i
hold
it
replaces
whilst
analysis
discovered
that
the
dream
was
provoked
by
an
unimportant
occurrence
the
evening
before
the
dream
naturally
i
would
not
draw
such
conclusions
if
only
one
analysis
were
known
to
me
experience
has
shown
me
that
when
the
associations
of
any
dream
are
honestly
followed
such
a
chain
of
thought
is
revealed
the
constituent
parts
of
the
dream
reappear
correctly
and
sensibly
linked
together
the
slight
suspicion
that
this
concatenation
was
merely
an
accident
of
a
single
first
observation
must
therefore
be
absolutely
relinquished
i
regard
it
therefore
as
my
right
to
establish
this
new
view
by
a
proper
nomenclature
i
contrast
the
dream
which
my
memory
evokes
with
the
dream
and
other
added
matter
revealed
by
analysis
the
former
i
call
the
dream
the
latter
without
at
first
further
subdivision
its
i
arrive
at
two
new
problems
hitherto
unformulated
what
is
the
psychical
process
which
has
transformed
the
latent
content
of
the
dream
into
its
manifest
content
what
is
the
motive
or
the
motives
which
have
made
such
transformation
exigent
the
process
by
which
the
change
from
latent
to
manifest
content
is
executed
i
name
the
in
contrast
with
this
is
the
of
which
produces
the
reverse
transformation
the
other
problems
of
the
dream
the
inquiry
as
to
its
stimuli
as
to
the
source
of
its
materials
as
to
its
possible
purpose
the
function
of
dreaming
the
forgetting
of
dreams
these
i
will
discuss
in
connection
with
the
latent
i
shall
take
every
care
to
avoid
a
confusion
between
the
and
the
for
i
ascribe
all
the
contradictory
as
well
as
the
incorrect
accounts
of
to
the
ignorance
of
this
latent
content
now
first
laid
bare
through
analysis
the
conversion
of
the
latent
dream
thoughts
into
those
manifest
deserves
our
close
study
as
the
first
known
example
of
the
transformation
of
psychical
stuff
from
one
mode
of
expression
into
another
from
a
mode
of
expression
which
moreover
is
readily
intelligible
into
another
which
we
can
only
penetrate
by
effort
and
with
guidance
although
this
new
mode
must
be
equally
reckoned
as
an
effort
of
our
own
psychical
activity
from
the
standpoint
of
the
relationship
of
latent
to
manifest
dreams
can
be
divided
into
three
classes
we
can
in
the
first
place
distinguish
those
dreams
which
have
a
and
are
at
the
same
time
which
allow
us
to
penetrate
into
our
psychical
life
without
further
ado
such
dreams
are
numerous
they
are
usually
short
and
as
a
general
rule
do
not
seem
very
noticeable
because
everything
remarkable
or
exciting
surprise
is
absent
their
occurrence
is
moreover
a
strong
argument
against
the
doctrine
which
derives
the
dream
from
the
isolated
activity
of
certain
cortical
elements
all
signs
of
a
lowered
or
subdivided
psychical
activity
are
wanting
yet
we
never
raise
any
objection
to
characterizing
them
as
dreams
nor
do
we
confound
them
with
the
products
of
our
waking
life
a
second
group
is
formed
by
those
dreams
which
are
indeed
and
have
a
distinct
meaning
but
appear
strange
because
we
are
unable
to
reconcile
their
meaning
with
our
mental
life
that
is
the
case
when
we
dream
for
instance
that
some
dear
relative
has
died
of
plague
when
we
know
of
no
ground
for
expecting
apprehending
or
assuming
anything
of
the
sort
we
can
only
ask
ourself
wonderingly
what
brought
that
into
my
head
to
the
third
group
those
dreams
belong
which
are
void
of
both
meaning
and
intelligibility
they
are
complicated
and
the
overwhelming
number
of
our
dreams
partake
of
this
character
and
this
has
given
rise
to
the
contemptuous
attitude
towards
dreams
and
the
medical
theory
of
their
limited
psychical
activity
it
is
especially
in
the
longer
and
more
complicated
that
signs
of
incoherence
are
seldom
missing
the
contrast
between
manifest
and
latent
is
clearly
only
of
value
for
the
dreams
of
the
second
and
more
especially
for
those
of
the
third
class
here
are
problems
which
are
only
solved
when
the
manifest
dream
is
replaced
by
its
latent
content
it
was
an
example
of
this
kind
a
complicated
and
unintelligible
dream
that
we
subjected
to
analysis
against
our
expectation
we
however
struck
upon
reasons
which
prevented
a
complete
cognizance
of
the
latent
dream
thought
on
the
repetition
of
this
same
experience
we
were
forced
to
the
supposition
that
there
is
an
bond
with
laws
of
its
own
between
the
unintelligible
and
complicated
nature
of
the
dream
and
the
difficulties
attending
communication
of
the
thoughts
connected
with
the
before
investigating
the
nature
of
this
bond
it
will
be
advantageous
to
turn
our
attention
to
the
more
readily
intelligible
dreams
of
the
first
class
where
the
manifest
and
latent
content
being
identical
the
dream
work
seems
to
be
omitted
the
investigation
of
these
dreams
is
also
advisable
from
another
standpoint
the
dreams
of
are
of
this
nature
they
have
a
meaning
and
are
not
bizarre
this
by
the
way
is
a
further
objection
to
reducing
dreams
to
a
dissociation
of
cerebral
activity
in
sleep
for
why
should
such
a
lowering
of
psychical
functions
belong
to
the
nature
of
sleep
in
adults
but
not
in
children
we
are
however
fully
justified
in
expecting
that
the
explanation
of
psychical
processes
in
children
essentially
simplified
as
they
may
be
should
serve
as
an
indispensable
preparation
towards
the
psychology
of
the
adult
i
shall
therefore
cite
some
examples
of
dreams
which
i
have
gathered
from
children
a
girl
of
nineteen
months
was
made
to
go
without
food
for
a
day
because
she
had
been
sick
in
the
morning
and
according
to
nurse
had
made
herself
ill
through
eating
strawberries
during
the
night
after
her
day
of
fasting
she
was
heard
calling
out
her
name
during
sleep
and
adding
eggs
she
is
dreaming
that
she
is
eating
and
selects
out
of
her
menu
exactly
what
she
supposes
she
will
not
get
much
of
just
now
the
same
kind
of
dream
about
a
forbidden
dish
was
that
of
a
little
boy
of
months
the
day
before
he
was
told
to
offer
his
uncle
a
present
of
a
small
basket
of
cherries
of
which
the
child
was
of
course
only
allowed
one
to
taste
he
woke
up
with
the
joyful
news
hermann
eaten
up
all
the
cherries
a
girl
of
three
and
a
half
years
had
made
during
the
day
a
sea
trip
which
was
too
short
for
her
and
she
cried
when
she
had
to
get
out
of
the
boat
the
next
morning
her
story
was
that
during
the
night
she
had
been
on
the
sea
thus
continuing
the
interrupted
trip
a
boy
of
five
and
a
half
years
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
his
party
during
a
walk
in
the
dachstein
region
whenever
a
new
peak
came
into
sight
he
asked
if
that
were
the
dachstein
and
finally
refused
to
accompany
the
party
to
the
waterfall
his
behavior
was
ascribed
to
fatigue
but
a
better
explanation
was
forthcoming
when
the
next
morning
he
told
his
dream
had
ascended
the
obviously
he
expected
the
ascent
of
the
dachstein
to
be
the
object
of
the
excursion
and
was
vexed
by
not
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
mountain
the
dream
gave
him
what
the
day
had
withheld
the
dream
of
a
girl
of
six
was
similar
her
father
had
cut
short
the
walk
before
reaching
the
promised
objective
on
account
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
on
the
way
back
she
noticed
a
signpost
giving
the
name
of
another
place
for
excursions
her
father
promised
to
take
her
there
also
some
other
day
she
greeted
her
father
next
day
with
the
news
that
she
had
dreamt
that
father
had
been
with
her
to
both
what
is
common
in
all
these
dreams
is
obvious
they
completely
satisfy
wishes
excited
during
the
day
which
remain
unrealized
they
are
simply
and
undisguisedly
realizations
of
wishes
the
following
not
quite
understandable
at
first
sight
is
nothing
else
than
a
wish
realized
on
account
of
poliomyelitis
a
girl
not
quite
four
years
of
age
was
brought
from
the
country
into
town
and
remained
over
night
with
a
childless
aunt
in
a
big
for
her
naturally
huge
bed
the
next
morning
she
stated
that
she
had
dreamt
that
bed
was
much
too
small
for
her
so
that
she
could
find
no
place
in
to
explain
this
dream
as
a
wish
is
easy
when
we
remember
that
to
be
big
is
a
frequently
expressed
wish
of
all
children
the
bigness
of
the
bed
reminded
miss
only
too
forcibly
of
her
smallness
this
nasty
situation
became
righted
in
her
dream
and
she
grew
so
big
that
the
bed
now
became
too
small
for
her
even
when
children
dreams
are
complicated
and
polished
their
comprehension
as
a
realization
of
desire
is
fairly
evident
a
boy
of
eight
dreamt
that
he
was
being
driven
with
achilles
in
a
guided
by
diomedes
the
day
before
he
was
assiduously
reading
about
great
heroes
it
is
easy
to
show
that
he
took
these
heroes
as
his
models
and
regretted
that
he
was
not
living
in
those
days
from
this
short
collection
a
further
characteristic
of
the
dreams
of
children
is
manifest
connection
with
the
life
of
the
the
desires
which
are
realized
in
these
dreams
are
left
over
from
the
day
or
as
a
rule
the
day
previous
and
the
feeling
has
become
intently
emphasized
and
fixed
during
the
day
thoughts
accidental
and
indifferent
matters
or
what
must
appear
so
to
the
child
find
no
acceptance
in
the
contents
of
the
dream
innumerable
instances
of
such
dreams
of
the
infantile
type
can
be
found
among
adults
also
but
as
mentioned
these
are
mostly
exactly
like
the
manifest
content
thus
a
random
selection
of
persons
will
generally
respond
to
thirst
at
with
a
dream
about
drinking
thus
striving
to
get
rid
of
the
sensation
and
to
let
sleep
continue
many
persons
frequently
have
these
comforting
before
waking
just
when
they
are
called
they
then
dream
that
they
are
already
up
that
they
are
washing
or
already
in
school
at
the
office
where
they
ought
to
be
at
a
given
time
the
night
before
an
intended
journey
one
not
infrequently
dreams
that
one
has
already
arrived
at
the
destination
before
going
to
a
play
or
to
a
party
the
dream
not
infrequently
anticipates
in
impatience
as
it
were
the
expected
pleasure
at
other
times
the
dream
expresses
the
realization
of
the
desire
somewhat
indirectly
some
connection
some
sequel
must
be
known
the
first
step
towards
recognizing
the
desire
thus
when
a
husband
related
to
me
the
dream
of
his
young
wife
that
her
monthly
period
had
begun
i
had
to
bethink
myself
that
the
young
wife
would
have
expected
a
pregnancy
if
the
period
had
been
absent
the
dream
is
then
a
sign
of
pregnancy
its
meaning
is
that
it
shows
the
wish
realized
that
pregnancy
should
not
occur
just
yet
under
unusual
and
extreme
circumstances
these
dreams
of
the
infantile
type
become
very
frequent
the
leader
of
a
polar
expedition
tells
us
for
instance
that
during
the
wintering
amid
the
ice
the
crew
with
their
monotonous
diet
and
slight
rations
dreamt
regularly
like
children
of
fine
meals
of
mountains
of
tobacco
and
of
home
it
is
not
uncommon
that
out
of
some
long
complicated
and
intricate
dream
one
specially
lucid
part
stands
out
containing
unmistakably
the
realization
of
a
desire
but
bound
up
with
much
unintelligible
matter
on
more
frequently
analyzing
the
seemingly
more
transparent
dreams
of
adults
it
is
astonishing
to
discover
that
these
are
rarely
as
simple
as
the
dreams
of
children
and
that
they
cover
another
meaning
beyond
that
of
the
realization
of
a
wish
it
would
certainly
be
a
simple
and
convenient
solution
of
the
riddle
if
the
work
of
analysis
made
it
at
all
possible
for
us
to
trace
the
meaningless
and
intricate
dreams
of
adults
back
to
the
infantile
type
to
the
realization
of
some
intensely
experienced
desire
of
the
day
but
there
is
no
warrant
for
such
an
expectation
their
dreams
are
generally
full
of
the
most
indifferent
and
bizarre
matter
and
no
trace
of
the
realization
of
the
wish
is
to
be
found
in
their
content
before
leaving
these
infantile
dreams
which
are
obviously
unrealized
desires
we
must
not
fail
to
mention
another
chief
characteristic
of
dreams
one
that
has
been
long
noticed
and
one
which
stands
out
most
clearly
in
this
class
i
can
replace
any
of
these
dreams
by
a
phrase
expressing
a
desire
if
the
sea
trip
had
only
lasted
longer
if
i
were
only
washed
and
dressed
if
i
had
only
been
allowed
to
keep
the
cherries
instead
of
giving
them
to
my
uncle
but
the
dream
gives
something
more
than
the
choice
for
here
the
desire
is
already
realized
its
realization
is
real
and
actual
the
dream
presentations
consist
chiefly
if
not
wholly
of
scenes
and
mainly
of
visual
sense
images
hence
a
kind
of
transformation
is
not
entirely
absent
in
this
class
of
dreams
and
this
may
be
fairly
designated
as
the
dream
work
idea
merely
existing
in
the
region
of
possibility
is
replaced
by
a
vision
of
its
ii
the
dream
mechanism
we
are
compelled
to
assume
that
such
transformation
of
scene
has
also
taken
place
in
intricate
dreams
though
we
do
not
know
whether
it
has
encountered
any
possible
desire
the
dream
instanced
at
the
commencement
which
we
analyzed
somewhat
thoroughly
did
give
us
occasion
in
two
places
to
suspect
something
of
the
kind
analysis
brought
out
that
my
wife
was
occupied
with
others
at
table
and
that
i
did
not
like
it
in
the
dream
itself
the
occurs
for
the
person
who
replaces
my
wife
gives
me
her
undivided
attention
but
can
one
wish
for
anything
pleasanter
after
a
disagreeable
incident
than
that
the
exact
contrary
should
have
occurred
just
as
the
dream
has
it
the
stinging
thought
in
the
analysis
that
i
have
never
had
anything
for
nothing
is
similarly
connected
with
the
woman
remark
in
the
dream
you
have
always
had
such
beautiful
eyes
some
portion
of
the
opposition
between
the
latent
and
manifest
content
of
the
dream
must
be
therefore
derived
from
the
realization
of
a
wish
another
manifestation
of
the
dream
work
which
all
incoherent
dreams
have
in
common
is
still
more
noticeable
choose
any
instance
and
compare
the
number
of
separate
elements
in
it
or
the
extent
of
the
dream
if
written
down
with
the
dream
thoughts
yielded
by
analysis
and
of
which
but
a
trace
can
be
refound
in
the
dream
itself
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
dream
working
has
resulted
in
an
extraordinary
compression
or
it
is
not
at
first
easy
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
the
extent
of
the
condensation
the
more
deeply
you
go
into
the
analysis
the
more
deeply
you
are
impressed
by
it
there
will
be
found
no
factor
in
the
dream
whence
the
chains
of
associations
do
not
lead
in
two
or
more
directions
no
scene
which
has
not
been
pieced
together
out
of
two
or
more
impressions
and
events
for
instance
i
once
dreamt
about
a
kind
of
where
the
bathers
suddenly
separated
in
all
directions
at
one
place
on
the
edge
a
person
stood
bending
towards
one
of
the
bathers
as
if
to
drag
him
out
the
scene
was
a
composite
one
made
up
out
of
an
event
that
occurred
at
the
time
of
puberty
and
of
two
pictures
one
of
which
i
had
seen
just
shortly
before
the
dream
the
two
pictures
were
the
surprise
in
the
bath
from
schwind
cycle
of
the
melusine
note
the
bathers
suddenly
separating
and
the
flood
by
an
italian
master
the
little
incident
was
that
i
once
witnessed
a
lady
who
had
tarried
in
the
until
the
men
hour
being
helped
out
of
the
water
by
the
the
scene
in
the
dream
which
was
selected
for
analysis
led
to
a
whole
group
of
reminiscences
each
one
of
which
had
contributed
to
the
dream
content
first
of
all
came
the
little
episode
from
the
time
of
my
courting
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
the
pressure
of
a
hand
under
the
table
gave
rise
in
the
dream
to
the
under
the
table
which
i
had
subsequently
to
find
a
place
for
in
my
recollection
there
was
of
course
at
the
time
not
a
word
about
undivided
attention
analysis
taught
me
that
this
factor
is
the
realization
of
a
desire
through
its
contradictory
and
related
to
the
behavior
of
my
wife
at
the
table
an
exactly
similar
and
much
more
important
episode
of
our
courtship
one
which
separated
us
for
an
entire
day
lies
hidden
behind
this
recent
recollection
the
intimacy
the
hand
resting
upon
the
knee
refers
to
a
quite
different
connection
and
to
quite
other
persons
this
element
in
the
dream
becomes
again
the
of
two
distinct
series
of
reminiscences
and
so
on
the
stuff
of
the
dream
thoughts
which
has
been
accumulated
for
the
formation
of
the
dream
scene
must
be
naturally
fit
for
this
application
there
must
be
one
or
more
common
factors
the
dream
work
proceeds
like
francis
galton
with
his
family
photographs
the
different
elements
are
put
one
on
top
of
the
other
what
is
common
to
the
composite
picture
stands
out
clearly
the
opposing
details
cancel
each
other
this
process
of
reproduction
partly
explains
the
wavering
statements
of
a
peculiar
vagueness
in
so
many
elements
of
the
dream
for
the
interpretation
of
dreams
this
rule
holds
good
when
analysis
discloses
as
to
read
each
section
of
the
apparent
alternatives
as
a
separate
outlet
for
a
series
of
impressions
when
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
the
dream
thoughts
the
dream
work
takes
the
trouble
to
create
a
something
in
order
to
make
a
common
presentation
feasible
in
the
dream
the
simplest
way
to
approximate
two
dream
thoughts
which
have
as
yet
nothing
in
common
consists
in
making
such
a
change
in
the
actual
expression
of
one
idea
as
will
meet
a
slight
responsive
recasting
in
the
form
of
the
other
idea
the
process
is
analogous
to
that
of
rhyme
when
consonance
supplies
the
desired
common
factor
a
good
deal
of
the
dream
work
consists
in
the
creation
of
those
frequently
very
witty
but
often
exaggerated
digressions
these
vary
from
the
common
presentation
in
the
dream
content
to
dream
thoughts
which
are
as
varied
as
are
the
causes
in
form
and
essence
which
give
rise
to
them
in
the
analysis
of
our
example
of
a
dream
i
find
a
like
case
of
the
transformation
of
a
thought
in
order
that
it
might
agree
with
another
essentially
foreign
one
in
following
out
the
analysis
i
struck
upon
the
thought
should
like
to
have
something
for
but
this
formula
is
not
serviceable
to
the
dream
hence
it
is
replaced
by
another
one
i
should
like
to
enjoy
something
free
of
cost
the
word
kost
taste
with
its
double
meaning
is
appropriate
to
a
table
it
moreover
is
in
place
through
the
special
sense
in
the
dream
at
home
if
there
is
a
dish
which
the
children
decline
their
mother
first
tries
gentle
persuasion
with
a
just
taste
it
that
the
dream
work
should
unhesitatingly
use
the
double
meaning
of
the
word
is
certainly
remarkable
ample
experience
has
shown
however
that
the
occurrence
is
quite
usual
through
condensation
of
the
dream
certain
constituent
parts
of
its
content
are
explicable
which
are
peculiar
to
the
dream
life
alone
and
which
are
not
found
in
the
waking
state
such
are
the
composite
and
mixed
persons
the
extraordinary
mixed
figures
creations
comparable
with
the
fantastic
animal
compositions
of
orientals
a
moment
thought
and
these
are
reduced
to
unity
whilst
the
fancies
of
the
dream
are
ever
formed
anew
in
an
inexhaustible
profusion
every
one
knows
such
images
in
his
own
dreams
manifold
are
their
origins
i
can
build
up
a
person
by
borrowing
one
feature
from
one
person
and
one
from
another
or
by
giving
to
the
form
of
one
the
name
of
another
in
my
dream
i
can
also
visualize
one
person
but
place
him
in
a
position
which
has
occurred
to
another
there
is
a
meaning
in
all
these
cases
when
different
persons
are
amalgamated
into
one
substitute
such
cases
denote
an
and
a
just
like
a
comparison
of
the
original
person
from
a
certain
point
of
view
a
comparison
which
can
be
also
realized
in
the
dream
itself
as
a
rule
however
the
identity
of
the
blended
persons
is
only
discoverable
by
analysis
and
is
only
indicated
in
the
dream
content
by
the
formation
of
the
combined
person
the
same
diversity
in
their
ways
of
formation
and
the
same
rules
for
its
solution
hold
good
also
for
the
innumerable
medley
of
dream
contents
examples
of
which
i
need
scarcely
adduce
their
strangeness
quite
disappears
when
we
resolve
not
to
place
them
on
a
level
with
the
objects
of
perception
as
known
to
us
when
awake
but
to
remember
that
they
represent
the
art
of
dream
condensation
by
an
exclusion
of
unnecessary
detail
prominence
is
given
to
the
common
character
of
the
combination
analysis
must
also
generally
supply
the
common
features
the
dream
says
simply
these
things
have
an
x
in
the
decomposition
of
these
mixed
images
by
analysis
is
often
the
quickest
way
to
an
interpretation
of
the
dream
thus
i
once
dreamt
that
i
was
sitting
with
one
of
my
former
university
tutors
on
a
bench
which
was
undergoing
a
rapid
continuous
movement
amidst
other
benches
this
was
a
combination
of
and
moving
staircase
i
will
not
pursue
the
further
result
of
the
thought
another
time
i
was
sitting
in
a
carriage
and
on
my
lap
an
object
in
shape
like
a
which
however
was
made
of
transparent
glass
the
scene
at
once
brought
to
my
mind
the
proverb
he
who
keeps
his
hat
in
his
hand
will
travel
safely
through
the
land
by
a
slight
turn
the
reminded
me
of
and
i
knew
that
i
was
about
to
invent
something
which
was
to
make
me
as
rich
and
independent
as
his
invention
had
made
my
countryman
auer
of
welsbach
then
i
should
be
able
to
travel
instead
of
remaining
in
vienna
in
the
dream
i
was
traveling
with
my
invention
with
the
it
is
true
rather
awkward
glass
the
dream
work
is
peculiarly
adept
at
representing
two
contradictory
conceptions
by
means
of
the
same
mixed
image
thus
for
instance
a
woman
dreamt
of
herself
carrying
a
tall
as
in
the
picture
of
the
annunciation
is
her
own
name
but
the
stalk
was
bedecked
with
thick
white
blossoms
resembling
camellias
contrast
with
chastity
la
dame
aux
camelias
a
great
deal
of
what
we
have
called
dream
condensation
can
be
thus
formulated
each
one
of
the
elements
of
the
dream
content
is
by
the
matter
of
the
dream
thoughts
it
is
not
derived
from
one
element
of
these
thoughts
but
from
a
whole
series
these
are
not
necessarily
interconnected
in
any
way
but
may
belong
to
the
most
diverse
spheres
of
thought
the
dream
element
truly
represents
all
this
disparate
matter
in
the
dream
content
analysis
moreover
discloses
another
side
of
the
relationship
between
dream
content
and
dream
thoughts
just
as
one
element
of
the
dream
leads
to
associations
with
several
dream
thoughts
so
as
a
rule
the
dream
thought
represents
more
than
one
dream
the
threads
of
the
association
do
not
simply
converge
from
the
dream
thoughts
to
the
dream
content
but
on
the
way
they
overlap
and
interweave
in
every
way
next
to
the
transformation
of
one
thought
in
the
scene
its
dramatization
condensation
is
the
most
important
and
most
characteristic
feature
of
the
dream
work
we
have
as
yet
no
clue
as
to
the
motive
calling
for
such
compression
of
the
content
in
the
complicated
and
intricate
dreams
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
condensation
and
dramatization
do
not
wholly
account
for
the
difference
between
dream
contents
and
dream
thoughts
there
is
evidence
of
a
third
factor
which
deserves
careful
consideration
when
i
have
arrived
at
an
understanding
of
the
dream
thoughts
by
my
analysis
i
notice
above
all
that
the
matter
of
the
manifest
is
very
different
from
that
of
the
latent
dream
content
that
is
i
admit
only
an
apparent
difference
which
vanishes
on
closer
investigation
for
in
the
end
i
find
the
whole
dream
content
carried
out
in
the
dream
thoughts
nearly
all
the
dream
thoughts
again
represented
in
the
dream
content
nevertheless
there
does
remain
a
certain
amount
of
difference
the
essential
content
which
stood
out
clearly
and
broadly
in
the
dream
must
after
analysis
rest
satisfied
with
a
very
subordinate
rôle
among
the
dream
thoughts
these
very
dream
thoughts
which
going
by
my
feelings
have
a
claim
to
the
greatest
importance
are
either
not
present
at
all
in
the
dream
content
or
are
represented
by
some
remote
allusion
in
some
obscure
region
of
the
dream
i
can
thus
describe
these
phenomena
the
dream
work
the
psychical
intensity
of
those
thoughts
and
conceptions
to
which
it
properly
pertains
flows
to
others
which
in
my
judgment
have
no
claim
to
such
there
is
no
other
process
which
contributes
so
much
to
concealment
of
the
meaning
and
to
make
the
connection
between
the
dream
content
and
dream
ideas
irrecognizable
during
this
process
which
i
will
call
dream
i
notice
also
the
psychical
intensity
significance
or
emotional
nature
of
the
thoughts
become
transposed
in
sensory
vividness
what
was
clearest
in
the
dream
seems
to
me
without
further
consideration
the
most
important
but
often
in
some
obscure
element
of
the
dream
i
can
recognize
the
most
direct
offspring
of
the
principal
dream
thought
i
could
only
designate
this
dream
displacement
as
the
of
psychical
the
phenomena
will
not
have
been
considered
in
all
its
bearings
unless
i
add
that
this
displacement
or
transvaluation
is
shared
by
different
dreams
in
extremely
varying
degrees
there
are
dreams
which
take
place
almost
without
any
displacement
these
have
the
same
time
meaning
and
intelligibility
as
we
found
in
the
dreams
which
recorded
a
desire
in
other
dreams
not
a
bit
of
the
dream
idea
has
retained
its
own
psychical
value
or
everything
essential
in
these
dream
ideas
has
been
replaced
by
unessentials
whilst
every
kind
of
transition
between
these
conditions
can
be
found
the
more
obscure
and
intricate
a
dream
is
the
greater
is
the
part
to
be
ascribed
to
the
impetus
of
displacement
in
its
formation
the
example
that
we
chose
for
analysis
shows
at
least
this
much
of
displacement
that
its
content
has
a
different
center
of
interest
from
that
of
the
dream
ideas
in
the
forefront
of
the
dream
content
the
main
scene
appears
as
if
a
woman
wished
to
make
advances
to
me
in
the
dream
idea
the
chief
interest
rests
on
the
desire
to
enjoy
disinterested
love
which
shall
cost
nothing
this
idea
lies
at
the
back
of
the
talk
about
the
beautiful
eyes
and
the
allusion
to
spinach
if
we
abolish
the
dream
displacement
we
attain
through
analysis
quite
certain
conclusions
regarding
two
problems
of
the
dream
which
are
most
disputed
as
to
what
provokes
a
dream
at
all
and
as
to
the
connection
of
the
dream
with
our
waking
life
there
are
dreams
which
at
once
expose
their
links
with
the
events
of
the
day
in
others
no
trace
of
such
a
connection
can
be
found
by
the
aid
of
analysis
it
can
be
shown
that
every
dream
without
any
exception
is
linked
up
with
our
impression
of
the
day
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
of
the
day
previous
to
the
dream
the
impressions
which
have
incited
the
dream
may
be
so
important
that
we
are
not
surprised
at
our
being
occupied
with
them
whilst
awake
in
this
case
we
are
right
in
saying
that
the
dream
carries
on
the
chief
interest
of
our
waking
life
more
usually
however
when
the
dream
contains
anything
relating
to
the
impressions
of
the
day
it
is
so
trivial
unimportant
and
so
deserving
of
oblivion
that
we
can
only
recall
it
with
an
effort
the
dream
content
appears
then
even
when
coherent
and
intelligible
to
be
concerned
with
those
indifferent
trifles
of
thought
undeserving
of
our
waking
interest
the
depreciation
of
dreams
is
largely
due
to
the
predominance
of
the
indifferent
and
the
worthless
in
their
content
analysis
destroys
the
appearance
upon
which
this
derogatory
judgment
is
based
when
the
dream
content
discloses
nothing
but
some
indifferent
impression
as
instigating
the
dream
analysis
ever
indicates
some
significant
event
which
has
been
replaced
by
something
indifferent
with
which
it
has
entered
into
abundant
associations
where
the
dream
is
concerned
with
uninteresting
and
unimportant
conceptions
analysis
reveals
the
numerous
associative
paths
which
connect
the
trivial
with
the
momentous
in
the
psychical
estimation
of
the
individual
is
only
the
action
of
displacement
if
what
is
indifferent
obtains
recognition
in
the
dream
content
instead
of
those
impressions
which
are
really
the
stimulus
or
instead
of
the
things
of
real
in
answering
the
question
as
to
what
provokes
the
dream
as
to
the
connection
of
the
dream
in
the
daily
troubles
we
must
say
in
terms
of
the
insight
given
us
by
replacing
the
manifest
latent
dream
content
dream
does
never
trouble
itself
about
things
which
are
not
deserving
of
our
concern
during
the
day
and
trivialities
which
do
not
trouble
us
during
the
day
have
no
power
to
pursue
us
whilst
what
provoked
the
dream
in
the
example
which
we
have
analyzed
the
really
unimportant
event
that
a
friend
invited
me
to
a
ride
in
his
the
table
scene
in
the
dream
contains
an
allusion
to
this
indifferent
motive
for
in
conversation
i
had
brought
the
taxi
parallel
with
the
table
but
i
can
indicate
the
important
event
which
has
as
its
substitute
the
trivial
one
a
few
days
before
i
had
disbursed
a
large
sum
of
money
for
a
member
of
my
family
who
is
very
dear
to
me
small
wonder
says
the
dream
thought
if
this
person
is
grateful
to
me
for
this
this
love
is
not
but
love
that
shall
cost
nothing
is
one
of
the
prime
thoughts
of
the
dream
the
fact
that
shortly
before
this
i
had
had
several
with
the
relative
in
question
puts
the
one
drive
with
my
friend
in
a
position
to
recall
the
connection
with
the
other
person
the
indifferent
impression
which
by
such
ramifications
provokes
the
dream
is
subservient
to
another
condition
which
is
not
true
of
the
real
source
of
the
dream
the
impression
must
be
a
recent
one
everything
arising
from
the
day
of
the
dream
i
can
not
leave
the
question
of
dream
displacement
without
the
consideration
of
a
remarkable
process
in
the
formation
of
dreams
in
which
condensation
and
displacement
work
together
towards
one
end
in
condensation
we
have
already
considered
the
case
where
two
conceptions
in
the
dream
having
something
in
common
some
point
of
contact
are
replaced
in
the
dream
content
by
a
mixed
image
where
the
distinct
germ
corresponds
to
what
is
common
and
the
indistinct
secondary
modifications
to
what
is
distinctive
if
displacement
is
added
to
condensation
there
is
no
formation
of
a
mixed
image
but
a
which
bears
the
same
relationship
to
the
individual
elements
as
does
the
resultant
in
the
parallelogram
of
forces
to
its
components
in
one
of
my
dreams
for
instance
there
is
talk
of
an
injection
with
on
first
analysis
i
discovered
an
indifferent
but
true
incident
where
played
a
part
as
the
excitant
of
the
dream
i
can
not
yet
vindicate
the
exchange
of
amyl
for
propyl
to
the
round
of
ideas
of
the
same
dream
however
there
belongs
the
recollection
of
my
first
visit
to
munich
when
the
struck
me
the
attendant
circumstances
of
the
analysis
render
it
admissible
that
the
influence
of
this
second
group
of
conceptions
caused
the
displacement
of
amyl
to
propyl
is
so
to
say
the
mean
idea
between
and
it
got
into
the
dream
as
a
kind
of
by
simultaneous
condensation
and
displacement
the
need
of
discovering
some
motive
for
this
bewildering
work
of
the
dream
is
even
more
called
for
in
the
case
of
displacement
than
in
condensation
although
the
work
of
displacement
must
be
held
mainly
responsible
if
the
dream
thoughts
are
not
refound
or
recognized
in
the
dream
content
unless
the
motive
of
the
changes
be
guessed
it
is
another
and
milder
kind
of
transformation
which
will
be
considered
with
the
dream
thoughts
which
leads
to
the
discovery
of
a
new
but
readily
understood
act
of
the
dream
work
the
first
dream
thoughts
which
are
unravelled
by
analysis
frequently
strike
one
by
their
unusual
wording
they
do
not
appear
to
be
expressed
in
the
sober
form
which
our
thinking
prefers
rather
are
they
expressed
symbolically
by
allegories
and
metaphors
like
the
figurative
language
of
the
poets
it
is
not
difficult
to
find
the
motives
for
this
degree
of
constraint
in
the
expression
of
dream
ideas
the
dream
content
consists
chiefly
of
visual
scenes
hence
the
dream
ideas
must
in
the
first
place
be
prepared
to
make
use
of
these
forms
of
presentation
conceive
that
a
political
leader
or
a
barrister
address
had
to
be
transposed
into
pantomime
and
it
will
be
easy
to
understand
the
transformations
to
which
the
dream
work
is
constrained
by
regard
for
this
of
the
dream
around
the
psychical
stuff
of
dream
thoughts
there
are
ever
found
reminiscences
of
impressions
not
infrequently
of
early
childhood
scenes
which
as
a
rule
have
been
visually
grasped
whenever
possible
this
portion
of
the
dream
ideas
exercises
a
definite
influence
upon
the
modelling
of
the
dream
content
it
works
like
a
center
of
crystallization
by
attracting
and
rearranging
the
stuff
of
the
dream
thoughts
the
scene
of
the
dream
is
not
infrequently
nothing
but
a
modified
repetition
complicated
by
interpolations
of
events
that
have
left
such
an
impression
the
dream
but
very
seldom
reproduces
accurate
and
unmixed
reproductions
of
real
scenes
the
dream
content
does
not
however
consist
exclusively
of
scenes
but
it
also
includes
scattered
fragments
of
visual
images
conversations
and
even
bits
of
unchanged
thoughts
it
will
be
perhaps
to
the
point
if
we
instance
in
the
briefest
way
the
means
of
dramatization
which
are
at
the
disposal
of
the
dream
work
for
the
repetition
of
the
dream
thoughts
in
the
peculiar
language
of
the
dream
the
dream
thoughts
which
we
learn
from
the
analysis
exhibit
themselves
as
a
psychical
complex
of
the
most
complicated
superstructure
their
parts
stand
in
the
most
diverse
relationship
to
each
other
they
form
backgrounds
and
foregrounds
stipulations
digressions
illustrations
demonstrations
and
protestations
it
may
be
said
to
be
almost
the
rule
that
one
train
of
thought
is
followed
by
its
contradictory
no
feature
known
to
our
reason
whilst
awake
is
absent
if
a
dream
is
to
grow
out
of
all
this
the
psychical
matter
is
submitted
to
a
pressure
which
condenses
it
extremely
to
an
inner
shrinking
and
displacement
creating
at
the
same
time
fresh
surfaces
to
a
selective
interweaving
among
the
constituents
best
adapted
for
the
construction
of
these
scenes
having
regard
to
the
origin
of
this
stuff
the
term
can
be
fairly
applied
to
this
process
the
logical
chains
which
hitherto
held
the
psychical
stuff
together
become
lost
in
this
transformation
to
the
dream
content
the
dream
work
takes
on
as
it
were
only
the
essential
content
of
the
dream
thoughts
for
elaboration
it
is
left
to
analysis
to
restore
the
connection
which
the
dream
work
has
destroyed
the
dream
means
of
expression
must
therefore
be
regarded
as
meager
in
comparison
with
those
of
our
imagination
though
the
dream
does
not
renounce
all
claims
to
the
restitution
of
logical
relation
to
the
dream
thoughts
it
rather
succeeds
with
tolerable
frequency
in
replacing
these
by
formal
characters
of
its
own
by
reason
of
the
undoubted
connection
existing
between
all
the
parts
of
dream
thoughts
the
dream
is
able
to
embody
this
matter
into
a
single
scene
it
upholds
a
as
in
time
and
just
as
the
painter
who
groups
all
the
poets
for
his
picture
of
parnassus
who
though
they
have
never
been
all
together
on
a
mountain
peak
yet
form
ideally
a
community
the
dream
continues
this
method
of
presentation
in
individual
dreams
and
often
when
it
displays
two
elements
close
together
in
the
dream
content
it
warrants
some
special
inner
connection
between
what
they
represent
in
the
dream
thoughts
it
should
be
moreover
observed
that
all
the
dreams
of
one
night
prove
on
analysis
to
originate
from
the
same
sphere
of
thought
the
causal
connection
between
two
ideas
is
either
left
without
presentation
or
replaced
by
two
different
long
portions
of
dreams
one
after
the
other
this
presentation
is
frequently
a
reversed
one
the
beginning
of
the
dream
being
the
deduction
and
its
end
the
hypothesis
the
direct
of
one
thing
into
another
in
the
dream
seems
to
serve
the
relationship
of
and
the
dream
never
utters
the
but
accepts
both
as
having
equal
rights
in
the
same
connection
when
is
used
in
the
reproduction
of
dreams
it
is
as
i
have
already
mentioned
to
be
replaced
by
conceptions
which
stand
in
opposition
to
one
another
are
preferably
expressed
in
dreams
by
the
same
element
there
seems
no
not
in
dreams
opposition
between
two
ideas
the
relation
of
conversion
is
represented
in
dreams
in
a
very
remarkable
way
it
is
expressed
by
the
reversal
of
another
part
of
the
dream
content
just
as
if
by
way
of
appendix
we
shall
later
on
deal
with
another
form
of
expressing
disagreement
the
common
dream
sensation
of
serves
the
purpose
of
representing
disagreement
of
impulses
a
of
the
only
one
of
the
logical
relationships
that
of
identity
is
found
highly
developed
in
the
mechanism
of
dream
formation
dream
work
makes
use
of
these
cases
as
a
for
condensation
drawing
together
everything
which
shows
such
agreement
to
a
these
short
crude
observations
naturally
do
not
suffice
as
an
estimate
of
the
abundance
of
the
dream
formal
means
of
presenting
the
logical
relationships
of
the
dream
thoughts
in
this
respect
individual
dreams
are
worked
up
more
nicely
or
more
carelessly
our
text
will
have
been
followed
more
or
less
closely
auxiliaries
of
the
dream
work
will
have
been
taken
more
or
less
into
consideration
in
the
latter
case
they
appear
obscure
intricate
incoherent
when
the
dream
appears
openly
absurd
when
it
contains
an
obvious
paradox
in
its
content
it
is
so
of
purpose
through
its
apparent
disregard
of
all
logical
claims
it
expresses
a
part
of
the
intellectual
content
of
the
dream
ideas
absurdity
in
the
dream
denotes
scorn
in
the
dream
thoughts
as
this
explanation
is
in
entire
disagreement
with
the
view
that
the
dream
owes
its
origin
to
dissociated
uncritical
cerebral
activity
i
will
emphasize
my
view
by
an
example
one
of
my
acquaintances
m
has
been
attacked
by
no
less
a
person
than
goethe
in
an
essay
with
we
all
maintain
unwarrantable
violence
m
has
naturally
been
ruined
by
this
attack
he
complains
very
bitterly
of
this
at
a
but
his
respect
for
goethe
has
not
diminished
through
this
personal
experience
i
now
attempt
to
clear
up
the
chronological
relations
which
strike
me
as
improbable
goethe
died
in
as
his
attack
upon
m
must
of
course
have
taken
place
before
m
must
have
been
then
a
very
young
man
it
seems
to
me
plausible
that
he
was
eighteen
i
am
not
certain
however
what
year
we
are
actually
in
and
the
whole
calculation
falls
into
obscurity
the
attack
was
moreover
contained
in
goethe
essay
on
the
absurdity
of
the
dream
becomes
the
more
glaring
when
i
state
that
m
is
a
young
business
man
without
any
poetical
or
literary
interests
my
analysis
of
the
dream
will
show
what
method
there
is
in
this
madness
the
dream
has
derived
its
material
from
three
sources
m
to
whom
i
was
introduced
at
a
begged
me
one
day
to
examine
his
elder
brother
who
showed
signs
of
mental
trouble
in
conversation
with
the
patient
an
unpleasant
episode
occurred
without
the
slightest
occasion
he
disclosed
one
of
his
brother
i
had
asked
the
patient
the
of
his
of
in
dream
and
led
him
to
various
calculations
which
might
show
up
his
want
of
memory
a
medical
journal
which
displayed
my
name
among
others
on
the
cover
had
published
a
review
of
a
book
by
my
friend
f
of
berlin
from
the
pen
of
a
very
reviewer
i
communicated
with
the
editor
who
indeed
expressed
his
regret
but
would
not
promise
any
redress
thereupon
i
broke
off
my
connection
with
the
paper
in
my
letter
of
resignation
i
expressed
the
hope
that
our
relations
would
not
suffer
from
here
is
the
real
source
of
the
dream
the
derogatory
reception
of
my
friend
work
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
in
my
judgment
it
contained
a
fundamental
biological
discovery
which
only
now
several
years
later
commences
to
find
favor
among
the
professors
a
little
while
before
a
patient
gave
me
the
medical
history
of
her
brother
who
exclaiming
nature
had
gone
out
of
his
mind
the
doctors
considered
that
the
exclamation
arose
from
a
study
of
beautiful
essay
and
indicated
that
the
patient
had
been
overworking
i
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
seemed
more
to
me
that
the
exclamation
nature
was
to
be
taken
in
that
sexual
meaning
known
also
to
the
less
educated
in
our
country
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
view
had
something
in
it
because
the
unfortunate
youth
afterwards
mutilated
his
genital
organs
the
patient
was
eighteen
years
old
when
the
attack
occurred
the
first
person
in
the
behind
the
ego
was
my
friend
who
had
been
so
scandalously
treated
i
now
attempted
to
clear
up
the
chronological
relation
my
friend
book
deals
with
the
chronological
relations
of
life
and
amongst
other
things
correlates
duration
of
life
with
a
number
of
days
in
many
ways
important
to
biology
the
ego
is
however
represented
as
a
general
paralytic
i
am
not
certain
what
year
we
are
actually
in
the
dream
exhibits
my
friend
as
behaving
like
a
general
paralytic
and
thus
riots
in
absurdity
but
the
dream
thoughts
run
ironically
of
course
he
is
a
madman
a
fool
and
you
are
the
genius
who
understands
all
about
it
but
should
it
be
the
way
this
inversion
obviously
took
place
in
the
dream
when
goethe
attacked
the
young
man
which
is
absurd
whilst
any
one
however
young
can
easily
attack
the
great
goethe
i
am
prepared
to
maintain
that
no
dream
is
inspired
by
other
than
egoistic
emotions
the
ego
in
the
dream
does
not
indeed
represent
only
my
friend
but
stands
for
myself
also
i
identify
myself
with
him
because
the
fate
of
his
discovery
appears
to
me
typical
of
the
acceptance
of
if
i
were
to
publish
my
own
theory
which
gives
sexuality
predominance
in
the
ætiology
of
psychoneurotic
disorders
see
the
allusion
to
the
patient
nature
nature
the
same
criticism
would
be
leveled
at
me
and
it
would
even
now
meet
with
the
same
contempt
when
i
follow
out
the
dream
thoughts
closely
i
ever
find
only
and
as
with
the
dream
it
is
well
known
that
the
discovery
of
a
cracked
sheep
skull
on
the
lido
in
venice
gave
goethe
the
hint
for
the
vertebral
theory
of
the
skull
my
friend
plumes
himself
on
having
as
a
student
raised
a
hubbub
for
the
resignation
of
an
aged
professor
who
had
done
good
work
including
some
in
this
very
subject
of
comparative
anatomy
but
who
on
account
of
had
become
quite
incapable
of
teaching
the
agitation
my
friend
inspired
was
so
successful
because
in
the
german
universities
an
is
not
demanded
for
academic
work
is
no
protection
against
in
the
hospital
here
i
had
for
years
the
honor
to
serve
under
a
chief
who
long
fossilized
was
for
decades
notoriously
and
was
yet
permitted
to
continue
in
his
responsible
office
a
trait
after
the
manner
of
the
find
in
the
lido
forces
itself
upon
me
here
it
was
to
this
man
that
some
youthful
colleagues
in
the
hospital
adapted
the
then
popular
slang
of
that
day
no
goethe
has
written
that
no
schiller
composed
that
etc
we
have
not
exhausted
our
valuation
of
the
dream
work
in
addition
to
condensation
displacement
and
definite
arrangement
of
the
psychical
matter
we
must
ascribe
to
it
yet
another
activity
one
which
is
indeed
not
shared
by
every
dream
i
shall
not
treat
this
position
of
the
dream
work
exhaustively
i
will
only
point
out
that
the
readiest
way
to
arrive
at
a
conception
of
it
is
to
take
for
granted
probably
unfairly
that
it
subsequently
influences
the
dream
content
which
has
already
been
built
its
mode
of
action
thus
consists
in
so
coördinating
the
parts
of
the
dream
that
these
coalesce
to
a
coherent
whole
to
a
dream
composition
the
dream
gets
a
kind
of
façade
which
it
is
true
does
not
conceal
the
whole
of
its
content
there
is
a
sort
of
preliminary
explanation
to
be
strengthened
by
interpolations
and
slight
alterations
such
elaboration
of
the
dream
content
must
not
be
too
pronounced
the
misconception
of
the
dream
thoughts
to
which
it
gives
rise
is
merely
superficial
and
our
first
piece
of
work
in
analyzing
a
dream
is
to
get
rid
of
these
early
attempts
at
interpretation
the
motives
for
this
part
of
the
dream
work
are
easily
gauged
this
final
elaboration
of
the
dream
is
due
to
a
for
a
fact
at
once
betraying
the
origin
of
an
action
which
behaves
towards
the
actual
dream
content
just
as
our
normal
psychical
action
behaves
towards
some
proffered
perception
that
is
to
our
liking
the
dream
content
is
thus
secured
under
the
pretense
of
certain
expectations
is
perceptually
classified
by
the
supposition
of
its
intelligibility
thereby
risking
its
falsification
whilst
in
fact
the
most
extraordinary
misconceptions
arise
if
the
dream
can
be
correlated
with
nothing
familiar
every
one
is
aware
that
we
are
unable
to
look
at
any
series
of
unfamiliar
signs
or
to
listen
to
a
discussion
of
unknown
words
without
at
once
making
perpetual
changes
through
regard
for
through
our
falling
back
upon
what
is
familiar
we
can
call
those
dreams
made
which
are
the
result
of
an
elaboration
in
every
way
analogous
to
the
psychical
action
of
our
waking
life
in
other
dreams
there
is
no
such
action
not
even
an
attempt
is
made
to
bring
about
order
and
meaning
we
regard
the
dream
as
quite
mad
because
on
awaking
it
is
with
this
part
of
the
dream
work
the
dream
elaboration
that
we
identify
ourselves
so
far
however
as
our
analysis
is
concerned
the
dream
which
resembles
a
medley
of
disconnected
fragments
is
of
as
much
value
as
the
one
with
a
smooth
and
beautifully
polished
surface
in
the
former
case
we
are
spared
to
some
extent
the
trouble
of
breaking
down
the
of
the
dream
content
all
the
same
it
would
be
an
error
to
see
in
the
dream
façade
nothing
but
the
misunderstood
and
somewhat
arbitrary
elaboration
of
the
dream
carried
out
at
the
instance
of
our
psychical
life
wishes
and
phantasies
are
not
infrequently
employed
in
the
erection
of
this
façade
which
were
already
fashioned
in
the
dream
thoughts
they
are
akin
to
those
of
our
waking
life
as
they
are
very
properly
called
these
wishes
and
phantasies
which
analysis
discloses
in
our
dreams
at
night
often
present
themselves
as
repetitions
and
refashionings
of
the
scenes
of
infancy
thus
the
dream
façade
may
show
us
directly
the
true
core
of
the
dream
distorted
through
admixture
with
other
matter
beyond
these
four
activities
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
discovered
in
the
dream
work
if
we
keep
closely
to
the
definition
that
dream
work
denotes
the
transference
of
dream
thoughts
to
dream
content
we
are
compelled
to
say
that
the
dream
work
is
not
creative
it
develops
no
fancies
of
its
own
it
judges
nothing
decides
nothing
it
does
nothing
but
prepare
the
matter
for
condensation
and
displacement
and
refashions
it
for
dramatization
to
which
must
be
added
the
inconstant
mechanism
that
of
explanatory
elaboration
it
is
true
that
a
good
deal
is
found
in
the
dream
content
which
might
be
understood
as
the
result
of
another
and
more
intellectual
performance
but
analysis
shows
conclusively
every
time
that
these
operations
were
already
present
in
the
dream
thoughts
and
have
only
been
taken
over
by
the
dream
a
syllogism
in
the
dream
is
nothing
other
than
the
repetition
of
a
syllogism
in
the
dream
thoughts
it
seems
inoffensive
if
it
has
been
transferred
to
the
dream
without
alteration
it
becomes
absurd
if
in
the
dream
work
it
has
been
transferred
to
other
matter
a
calculation
in
the
dream
content
simply
means
that
there
was
a
calculation
in
the
dream
thoughts
whilst
this
is
always
correct
the
calculation
in
the
dream
can
furnish
the
silliest
results
by
the
condensation
of
its
factors
and
the
displacement
of
the
same
operations
to
other
things
even
speeches
which
are
found
in
the
dream
content
are
not
new
compositions
they
prove
to
be
pieced
together
out
of
speeches
which
have
been
made
or
heard
or
read
the
words
are
faithfully
copied
but
the
occasion
of
their
utterance
is
quite
overlooked
and
their
meaning
is
most
violently
changed
it
is
perhaps
not
superfluous
to
support
these
assertions
by
examples
seemingly
inoffensive
dream
of
a
patient
she
was
going
to
market
with
her
cook
who
carried
the
basket
the
butcher
said
to
her
when
she
asked
him
for
something
that
is
all
gone
and
wished
to
give
her
something
else
remarking
that
very
good
she
declines
and
goes
to
the
greengrocer
who
wants
to
sell
her
a
peculiar
vegetable
which
is
bound
up
in
bundles
and
of
a
black
color
she
says
i
know
that
i
wo
take
it
the
remark
that
is
all
gone
arose
from
the
treatment
a
few
days
before
i
said
myself
to
the
patient
that
the
earliest
reminiscences
of
childhood
all
as
such
but
are
replaced
by
transferences
and
dreams
thus
i
am
the
butcher
the
second
remark
i
do
know
that
arose
in
a
very
different
connection
the
day
before
she
had
herself
called
out
in
rebuke
to
the
cook
who
moreover
also
appears
in
the
dream
yourself
i
do
know
that
is
i
do
know
this
kind
of
behavior
i
wo
have
it
the
more
harmless
portion
of
this
speech
was
arrived
at
by
a
displacement
of
the
dream
content
in
the
dream
thoughts
only
the
other
portion
of
the
speech
played
a
part
because
the
dream
work
changed
an
imaginary
situation
into
utter
irrecognizability
and
complete
inoffensiveness
while
in
a
certain
sense
i
behave
in
an
unseemly
way
to
the
lady
the
situation
resulting
in
this
phantasy
is
however
nothing
but
a
new
edition
of
one
that
actually
took
place
a
dream
apparently
meaningless
relates
to
figures
she
wants
to
pay
something
her
daughter
takes
three
florins
kreuzers
out
of
her
purse
but
she
says
are
you
doing
it
only
cost
kreuzers
the
dreamer
was
a
stranger
who
had
placed
her
child
at
school
in
vienna
and
who
was
able
to
continue
under
my
treatment
so
long
as
her
daughter
remained
at
vienna
the
day
before
the
dream
the
directress
of
the
school
had
recommended
her
to
keep
the
child
another
year
at
school
in
this
case
she
would
have
been
able
to
prolong
her
treatment
by
one
year
the
figures
in
the
dream
become
important
if
it
be
remembered
that
time
is
money
one
year
equals
days
or
expressed
in
kreuzers
kreuzers
which
is
three
florins
kreuzers
the
kreuzers
correspond
with
the
three
weeks
which
remained
from
the
day
of
the
dream
to
the
end
of
the
school
term
and
thus
to
the
end
of
the
treatment
it
was
obviously
financial
considerations
which
had
moved
the
lady
to
refuse
the
proposal
of
the
directress
and
which
were
answerable
for
the
triviality
of
the
amount
in
the
dream
a
lady
young
but
already
ten
years
married
heard
that
a
friend
of
hers
miss
elise
l
of
about
the
same
age
had
become
engaged
this
gave
rise
to
the
following
dream
was
sitting
with
her
husband
in
the
theater
the
one
side
of
the
stalls
was
quite
empty
her
husband
tells
her
elise
l
and
her
fiancé
had
intended
coming
but
could
only
get
some
cheap
seats
three
for
one
florin
fifty
kreuzers
and
these
they
would
not
take
in
her
opinion
that
would
not
have
mattered
very
the
origin
of
the
figures
from
the
matter
of
the
dream
thoughts
and
the
changes
the
figures
underwent
are
of
interest
whence
came
the
one
florin
fifty
kreuzers
from
a
trifling
occurrence
of
the
previous
day
her
had
received
florins
as
a
present
from
her
husband
and
had
quickly
got
rid
of
it
by
buying
some
ornament
note
that
florins
is
one
hundred
times
one
florin
fifty
kreuzers
for
the
concerned
with
the
tickets
the
only
link
is
that
elise
l
is
exactly
three
months
younger
than
the
dreamer
the
scene
in
the
dream
is
the
repetition
of
a
little
adventure
for
which
she
has
often
been
teased
by
her
husband
she
was
once
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
tickets
in
time
for
a
piece
and
when
she
came
to
the
theater
side
of
the
stalls
was
almost
it
was
therefore
quite
unnecessary
for
her
to
have
been
in
a
nor
must
we
overlook
the
absurdity
of
the
dream
that
two
persons
should
take
three
tickets
for
the
theater
now
for
the
dream
ideas
it
was
to
have
married
so
early

have
been
so
great

shows
me
that
i
should
have
been
able
to
get

husband

indeed
one
a
times
if
i
had
but
waited

could
have
bought
such
men
with

iii
why
the
dream
disguises
the
desires
in
the
foregoing
exposition
we
have
now
learnt
something
of
the
dream
work
we
must
regard
it
as
a
quite
special
psychical
process
which
so
far
as
we
are
aware
resembles
nothing
else
to
the
dream
work
has
been
transferred
that
bewilderment
which
its
product
the
dream
has
aroused
in
us
in
truth
the
dream
work
is
only
the
first
recognition
of
a
group
of
psychical
processes
to
which
must
be
referred
the
origin
of
hysterical
symptoms
the
ideas
of
morbid
dread
obsession
and
illusion
condensation
and
especially
displacement
are
features
in
these
other
processes
the
regard
for
appearance
remains
on
the
other
hand
peculiar
to
the
dream
work
if
this
explanation
brings
the
dream
into
line
with
the
formation
of
psychical
disease
it
becomes
the
more
important
to
fathom
the
essential
conditions
of
processes
like
dream
building
it
will
be
probably
a
surprise
to
hear
that
neither
the
state
of
sleep
nor
illness
is
among
the
indispensable
conditions
a
whole
number
of
phenomena
of
the
everyday
life
of
healthy
persons
forgetfulness
slips
in
speaking
and
in
holding
things
together
with
a
certain
class
of
mistakes
are
due
to
a
psychical
mechanism
analogous
to
that
of
the
dream
and
the
other
members
of
this
group
displacement
is
the
core
of
the
problem
and
the
most
striking
of
all
the
dream
performances
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
subject
shows
that
the
essential
condition
of
displacement
is
purely
psychological
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
motive
we
get
on
the
track
by
thrashing
out
experiences
which
one
can
not
avoid
in
the
analysis
of
dreams
i
had
to
break
off
the
relations
of
my
dream
thoughts
in
the
analysis
of
my
dream
on
because
i
found
some
experiences
which
i
do
not
wish
strangers
to
know
and
which
i
could
not
relate
without
serious
damage
to
important
considerations
i
added
it
would
be
no
use
were
i
to
select
another
instead
of
that
particular
dream
in
every
dream
where
the
content
is
obscure
or
intricate
i
should
hit
upon
dream
thoughts
which
call
for
secrecy
if
however
i
continue
the
analysis
for
myself
without
regard
to
those
others
for
whom
indeed
so
personal
an
event
as
my
dream
can
not
matter
i
arrive
finally
at
ideas
which
surprise
me
which
i
have
not
known
to
be
mine
which
not
only
appear
to
me
but
which
are
and
which
i
would
like
to
oppose
vehemently
whilst
the
chain
of
ideas
running
through
the
analysis
intrudes
upon
me
inexorably
i
can
only
take
these
circumstances
into
account
by
admitting
that
these
thoughts
are
actually
part
of
my
psychical
life
possessing
a
certain
psychical
intensity
or
energy
however
by
virtue
of
a
particular
psychological
condition
the
could
not
become
conscious
to
i
call
this
particular
condition
it
is
therefore
impossible
for
me
not
to
recognize
some
casual
relationship
between
the
obscurity
of
the
dream
content
and
this
state
of
repression
this
of
whence
i
conclude
that
the
cause
of
the
obscurity
is
desire
to
conceal
these
thus
i
arrive
at
the
conception
of
the
as
the
deed
of
the
dream
work
and
of
serving
to
disguise
this
object
i
will
test
this
in
my
own
dream
and
ask
myself
what
is
the
thought
which
quite
innocuous
in
its
distorted
form
provokes
my
liveliest
opposition
in
its
real
form
i
remember
that
the
free
drive
reminded
me
of
the
last
expensive
drive
with
a
member
of
my
family
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
being
i
should
for
once
like
to
experience
affection
for
which
i
should
not
have
to
pay
and
that
shortly
before
the
dream
i
had
to
make
a
heavy
disbursement
for
this
very
person
in
this
connection
i
can
not
get
away
from
the
thought
i
regret
this
it
is
only
when
i
acknowledge
this
feeling
that
there
is
any
sense
in
my
wishing
in
the
dream
for
an
affection
that
should
entail
no
outlay
and
yet
i
can
state
on
my
honor
that
i
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
when
it
became
necessary
to
expend
that
sum
the
regret
the
was
unconscious
to
me
why
it
was
unconscious
is
quite
another
question
which
would
lead
us
far
away
from
the
answer
which
though
within
my
knowledge
belongs
elsewhere
if
i
subject
the
dream
of
another
person
instead
of
one
of
my
own
to
analysis
the
result
is
the
same
the
motives
for
convincing
others
is
however
changed
in
the
dream
of
a
healthy
person
the
only
way
for
me
to
enable
him
to
accept
this
repressed
idea
is
the
coherence
of
the
dream
thoughts
he
is
at
liberty
to
reject
this
explanation
but
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
person
suffering
from
any
neurosis
say
from
hysteria
the
recognition
of
these
repressed
ideas
is
compulsory
by
reason
of
their
connection
with
the
symptoms
of
his
illness
and
of
the
improvement
resulting
from
exchanging
the
symptoms
for
the
repressed
ideas
take
the
patient
from
whom
i
got
the
last
dream
about
the
three
tickets
for
one
florin
fifty
kreuzers
analysis
shows
that
she
does
not
think
highly
of
her
husband
that
she
regrets
having
married
him
that
she
would
be
glad
to
change
him
for
some
one
else
it
is
true
that
she
maintains
that
she
loves
her
husband
that
her
emotional
life
knows
nothing
about
this
depreciation
a
hundred
times
better
but
all
her
symptoms
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
as
this
dream
when
her
repressed
memories
had
rewakened
a
certain
period
when
she
was
conscious
that
she
did
not
love
her
husband
her
symptoms
disappeared
and
therewith
disappeared
her
resistance
to
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
this
conception
of
repression
once
fixed
together
with
the
distortion
of
the
dream
in
relation
to
repressed
psychical
matter
we
are
in
a
position
to
give
a
general
exposition
of
the
principal
results
which
the
analysis
of
dreams
supplies
we
learnt
that
the
most
intelligible
and
meaningful
dreams
are
unrealized
desires
the
desires
they
pictured
as
realized
are
known
to
consciousness
have
been
held
over
from
the
daytime
and
are
of
absorbing
interest
the
analysis
of
obscure
and
intricate
dreams
discloses
something
very
similar
the
dream
scene
again
pictures
as
realized
some
desire
which
regularly
proceeds
from
the
dream
ideas
but
the
picture
is
unrecognizable
and
is
only
cleared
up
in
the
analysis
the
desire
itself
is
either
one
repressed
foreign
to
consciousness
or
it
is
closely
bound
up
with
repressed
ideas
the
formula
for
these
dreams
may
be
thus
stated
are
concealed
realizations
of
repressed
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
they
are
right
who
regard
the
dream
as
foretelling
the
future
although
the
future
which
the
dream
shows
us
is
not
that
which
will
occur
but
that
which
we
would
like
to
occur
folk
psychology
proceeds
here
according
to
its
wont
it
believes
what
it
wishes
to
believe
dreams
can
be
divided
into
three
classes
according
to
their
relation
towards
the
realization
of
desire
firstly
come
those
which
exhibit
a
these
are
dreams
of
the
infantile
type
becoming
ever
rarer
among
adults
secondly
dreams
which
express
in
form
some
these
constitute
by
far
the
larger
number
of
our
dreams
and
they
require
analysis
for
their
understanding
thirdly
these
dreams
where
repression
exists
but
or
with
but
slight
concealment
these
dreams
are
invariably
accompanied
by
a
feeling
of
dread
which
brings
the
dream
to
an
end
this
feeling
of
dread
here
replaces
dream
displacement
i
regarded
the
dream
work
as
having
prevented
this
in
the
dream
of
the
second
class
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
prove
that
what
is
now
present
as
intense
dread
in
the
dream
was
once
desire
and
is
now
secondary
to
the
repression
there
are
also
definite
dreams
with
a
painful
content
without
the
presence
of
any
anxiety
in
the
dream
these
can
not
be
reckoned
among
dreams
of
dread
they
have
however
always
been
used
to
prove
the
unimportance
and
the
psychical
futility
of
dreams
an
analysis
of
such
an
example
will
show
that
it
belongs
to
our
second
class
of
dreams
a
realization
of
repressed
desires
analysis
will
demonstrate
at
the
same
time
how
excellently
adapted
is
the
work
of
displacement
to
the
concealment
of
desires
a
girl
dreamt
that
she
saw
lying
dead
before
her
the
only
surviving
child
of
her
sister
amid
the
same
surroundings
as
a
few
years
before
she
saw
the
first
child
lying
dead
she
was
not
sensible
of
any
pain
but
naturally
combatted
the
view
that
the
scene
represented
a
desire
of
hers
nor
was
that
view
necessary
years
ago
it
was
at
the
funeral
of
the
child
that
she
had
last
seen
and
spoken
to
the
man
she
loved
were
the
second
child
to
die
she
would
be
sure
to
meet
this
man
again
in
her
sister
house
she
is
longing
to
meet
him
but
struggles
against
this
feeling
the
day
of
the
dream
she
had
taken
a
ticket
for
a
lecture
which
announced
the
presence
of
the
man
she
always
loved
the
dream
is
simply
a
dream
of
impatience
common
to
those
which
happen
before
a
journey
theater
or
simply
anticipated
pleasures
the
longing
is
concealed
by
the
shifting
of
the
scene
to
the
occasion
when
any
joyous
feeling
were
out
of
place
and
yet
where
it
did
once
exist
note
further
that
the
emotional
behavior
in
the
dream
is
adapted
not
to
the
displaced
but
to
the
real
but
suppressed
dream
ideas
the
scene
anticipates
the
meeting
there
is
here
no
call
for
painful
emotions
there
has
hitherto
been
no
occasion
for
philosophers
to
bestir
themselves
with
a
psychology
of
repression
we
must
be
allowed
to
construct
some
clear
conception
as
to
the
origin
of
dreams
as
the
first
steps
in
this
unknown
territory
the
scheme
which
we
have
formulated
not
only
from
a
study
of
dreams
is
it
is
true
already
somewhat
complicated
but
we
can
not
find
any
simpler
one
that
will
suffice
we
hold
that
our
psychical
apparatus
contains
two
procedures
for
the
construction
of
thoughts
the
second
one
has
the
advantage
that
its
products
find
an
open
path
to
consciousness
whilst
the
activity
of
the
first
procedure
is
unknown
to
itself
and
can
only
arrive
at
consciousness
through
the
second
one
at
the
borderland
of
these
two
procedures
where
the
first
passes
over
into
the
second
a
censorship
is
established
which
only
passes
what
pleases
it
keeping
back
everything
else
that
which
is
rejected
by
the
censorship
is
according
to
our
definition
in
a
state
of
repression
under
certain
conditions
one
of
which
is
the
sleeping
state
the
balance
of
power
between
the
two
procedures
is
so
changed
that
what
is
repressed
can
no
longer
be
kept
back
in
the
sleeping
state
this
may
possibly
occur
through
the
negligence
of
the
censor
what
has
been
hitherto
repressed
will
now
succeed
in
finding
its
way
to
consciousness
but
as
the
censorship
is
never
absent
but
merely
off
guard
certain
alterations
must
be
conceded
so
as
to
placate
it
it
is
a
compromise
which
becomes
conscious
in
this
case
a
compromise
between
what
one
procedure
has
in
view
and
the
demands
of
the
other
laxity
of
the
censor
this
is
the
foundation
for
the
origin
of
many
another
psychological
process
just
as
it
is
for
the
dream
in
such
compromises
we
can
observe
the
processes
of
condensation
of
displacement
the
acceptance
of
superficial
associations
which
we
have
found
in
the
dream
work
it
is
not
for
us
to
deny
the
demonic
element
which
has
played
a
part
in
constructing
our
explanation
of
dream
work
the
impression
left
is
that
the
formation
of
obscure
dreams
proceeds
as
if
a
person
had
something
to
say
which
must
be
agreeable
for
another
person
upon
whom
he
is
dependent
to
hear
it
is
by
the
use
of
this
image
that
we
figure
to
ourselves
the
conception
of
the
and
of
the
censorship
and
ventured
to
crystallize
our
impression
in
a
rather
crude
but
at
least
definite
psychological
theory
whatever
explanation
the
future
may
offer
of
these
first
and
second
procedures
we
shall
expect
a
confirmation
of
our
correlate
that
the
second
procedure
commands
the
entrance
to
consciousness
and
can
exclude
the
first
from
consciousness
once
the
sleeping
state
overcome
the
censorship
resumes
complete
sway
and
is
now
able
to
revoke
that
which
was
granted
in
a
moment
of
weakness
that
the
of
dreams
explains
this
in
part
at
least
we
are
convinced
by
our
experience
confirmed
again
and
again
during
the
relation
of
a
dream
or
during
analysis
of
one
it
not
infrequently
happens
that
some
fragment
of
the
dream
is
suddenly
forgotten
this
fragment
so
forgotten
invariably
contains
the
best
and
readiest
approach
to
an
understanding
of
the
dream
probably
that
is
why
it
sinks
into
oblivion
into
a
renewed
suppression
viewing
the
dream
content
as
the
representation
of
a
realized
desire
and
referring
its
vagueness
to
the
changes
made
by
the
censor
in
the
repressed
matter
it
is
no
longer
difficult
to
grasp
the
function
of
dreams
in
fundamental
contrast
with
those
saws
which
assume
that
sleep
is
disturbed
by
dreams
we
hold
the
as
the
guardian
of
so
far
as
children
dreams
are
concerned
our
view
should
find
ready
acceptance
the
sleeping
state
or
the
psychical
change
to
sleep
whatsoever
it
be
is
brought
about
by
the
child
being
sent
to
sleep
or
compelled
thereto
by
fatigue
only
assisted
by
the
removal
of
all
stimuli
which
might
open
other
objects
to
the
psychical
apparatus
the
means
which
serve
to
keep
external
stimuli
distant
are
known
but
what
are
the
means
we
can
employ
to
depress
the
internal
psychical
stimuli
which
frustrate
sleep
look
at
a
mother
getting
her
child
to
sleep
the
child
is
full
of
beseeching
he
wants
another
kiss
he
wants
to
play
yet
awhile
his
requirements
are
in
part
met
in
part
drastically
put
off
till
the
following
day
clearly
these
desires
and
needs
which
agitate
him
are
hindrances
to
sleep
every
one
knows
the
charming
story
of
the
bad
boy
baldwin
groller
who
awoke
at
night
bellowing
out
want
the
a
really
good
boy
instead
of
bellowing
would
have
that
he
was
playing
with
the
rhinoceros
because
the
dream
which
realizes
his
desire
is
believed
during
sleep
it
removes
the
desire
and
makes
sleep
possible
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
belief
accords
with
the
dream
image
because
it
is
arrayed
in
the
psychical
appearance
of
probability
the
child
is
without
the
capacity
which
it
will
acquire
later
to
distinguish
hallucinations
or
phantasies
from
reality
the
adult
has
learnt
this
differentiation
he
has
also
learnt
the
futility
of
desire
and
by
continuous
practice
manages
to
postpone
his
aspirations
until
they
can
be
granted
in
some
roundabout
method
by
a
change
in
the
external
world
for
this
reason
it
is
rare
for
him
to
have
his
wishes
realized
during
sleep
in
the
short
psychical
way
it
is
even
possible
that
this
never
happens
and
that
everything
which
appears
to
us
like
a
child
dream
demands
a
much
more
elaborate
explanation
thus
it
is
that
for
adults
for
every
sane
person
without
exception
a
differentiation
of
the
psychical
matter
has
been
fashioned
which
the
child
knew
not
a
psychical
procedure
has
been
reached
which
informed
by
the
experience
of
life
exercises
with
jealous
power
a
dominating
and
restraining
influence
upon
psychical
emotions
by
its
relation
to
consciousness
and
by
its
spontaneous
mobility
it
is
endowed
with
the
greatest
means
of
psychical
power
a
portion
of
the
infantile
emotions
has
been
withheld
from
this
procedure
as
useless
to
life
and
all
the
thoughts
which
flow
from
these
are
found
in
the
state
of
repression
whilst
the
procedure
in
which
we
recognize
our
normal
ego
reposes
upon
the
desire
for
sleep
it
appears
compelled
by
the
conditions
of
sleep
to
abandon
some
of
the
energy
with
which
it
was
wont
during
the
day
to
keep
down
what
was
repressed
this
neglect
is
really
harmless
however
much
the
emotions
of
the
child
spirit
may
be
stirred
they
find
the
approach
to
consciousness
rendered
difficult
and
that
to
movement
blocked
in
consequence
of
the
state
of
sleep
the
danger
of
their
disturbing
sleep
must
however
be
avoided
moreover
we
must
admit
that
even
in
deep
sleep
some
amount
of
free
attention
is
exerted
as
a
protection
against
which
might
perchance
make
an
awakening
seem
wiser
than
the
continuance
of
sleep
otherwise
we
could
not
explain
the
fact
of
our
being
always
awakened
by
stimuli
of
certain
quality
as
the
old
physiologist
burdach
pointed
out
the
mother
is
awakened
by
the
whimpering
of
her
child
the
miller
by
the
cessation
of
his
mill
most
people
by
gently
calling
out
their
names
this
attention
thus
on
the
alert
makes
use
of
the
internal
stimuli
arising
from
repressed
desires
and
fuses
them
into
the
dream
which
as
a
compromise
satisfies
both
procedures
at
the
same
time
the
dream
creates
a
form
of
psychical
release
for
the
wish
which
is
either
suppressed
or
formed
by
the
aid
of
repression
inasmuch
as
it
presents
it
as
realized
the
other
procedure
is
also
satisfied
since
the
continuance
of
the
sleep
is
assured
our
ego
here
gladly
behaves
like
a
child
it
makes
the
dream
pictures
believable
saying
as
it
were
quite
right
but
let
me
sleep
the
contempt
which
once
awakened
we
bear
the
dream
and
which
rests
upon
the
absurdity
and
apparent
illogicality
of
the
dream
is
probably
nothing
but
the
reasoning
of
our
sleeping
ego
on
the
feelings
about
what
was
repressed
with
greater
right
it
should
rest
upon
the
incompetency
of
this
disturber
of
our
sleep
in
sleep
we
are
now
and
then
aware
of
this
contempt
the
dream
content
transcends
the
censorship
rather
too
much
we
think
it
only
a
dream
and
sleep
on
it
is
no
objection
to
this
view
if
there
are
borderlines
for
the
dream
where
its
function
to
preserve
sleep
from
interruption
can
no
longer
be
maintained
as
in
the
dreams
of
impending
dread
it
is
here
changed
for
another
function
to
suspend
the
sleep
at
the
proper
time
it
acts
like
a
conscientious
who
first
does
his
duty
by
quelling
disturbances
so
as
not
to
waken
the
citizen
but
equally
does
his
duty
quite
properly
when
he
awakens
the
street
should
the
causes
of
the
trouble
seem
to
him
serious
and
himself
unable
to
cope
with
them
alone
this
function
of
dreams
becomes
especially
well
marked
when
there
arises
some
incentive
for
the
sense
perception
that
the
senses
aroused
during
sleep
influence
the
dream
is
well
known
and
can
be
experimentally
verified
it
is
one
of
the
certain
but
much
overestimated
results
of
the
medical
investigation
of
dreams
hitherto
there
has
been
an
insoluble
riddle
connected
with
this
discovery
the
stimulus
to
the
sense
by
which
the
investigator
affects
the
sleeper
is
not
properly
recognized
in
the
dream
but
is
intermingled
with
a
number
of
indefinite
interpretations
whose
determination
appears
left
to
psychical
there
is
of
course
no
such
psychical
to
an
external
the
sleeper
can
react
in
many
ways
either
he
awakens
or
he
succeeds
in
sleeping
on
in
the
latter
case
he
can
make
use
of
the
dream
to
dismiss
the
external
stimulus
and
this
again
in
more
ways
than
one
for
instance
he
can
stay
the
stimulus
by
dreaming
of
a
scene
which
is
absolutely
intolerable
to
him
this
was
the
means
used
by
one
who
was
troubled
by
a
painful
perineal
abscess
he
dreamt
that
he
was
on
horseback
and
made
use
of
the
poultice
which
was
intended
to
alleviate
his
pain
as
a
saddle
and
thus
got
away
from
the
cause
of
the
trouble
or
as
is
more
frequently
the
case
the
external
stimulus
undergoes
a
new
rendering
which
leads
him
to
connect
it
with
a
repressed
desire
seeking
its
realization
and
robs
him
of
its
reality
and
is
treated
as
if
it
were
a
part
of
the
psychical
matter
thus
some
one
dreamt
that
he
had
written
a
comedy
which
embodied
a
definite
it
was
being
performed
the
first
act
was
over
amid
enthusiastic
applause
there
was
great
clapping
at
this
moment
the
dreamer
must
have
succeeded
in
prolonging
his
sleep
despite
the
disturbance
for
when
he
woke
he
no
longer
heard
the
noise
he
concluded
rightly
that
some
one
must
have
been
beating
a
carpet
or
bed
the
dreams
which
come
with
a
loud
noise
just
before
waking
have
all
attempted
to
cover
the
stimulus
to
waking
by
some
other
explanation
and
thus
to
prolong
the
sleep
for
a
little
while
whosoever
has
firmly
accepted
this
as
the
chief
motive
for
the
distortion
of
dreams
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
as
the
result
of
dream
interpretation
that
most
of
the
dreams
of
adults
are
traced
by
analysis
to
erotic
desires
this
assertion
is
not
drawn
from
dreams
obviously
of
a
sexual
nature
which
are
known
to
all
dreamers
from
their
own
experience
and
are
the
only
ones
usually
described
as
sexual
dreams
these
dreams
are
ever
sufficiently
mysterious
by
reason
of
the
choice
of
persons
who
are
made
the
objects
of
sex
the
removal
of
all
the
barriers
which
cry
halt
to
the
dreamer
sexual
needs
in
his
waking
state
the
many
strange
reminders
as
to
details
of
what
are
called
perversions
but
analysis
discovers
that
in
many
other
dreams
in
whose
manifest
content
nothing
erotic
can
be
found
the
work
of
interpretation
shows
them
up
as
in
reality
realization
of
sexual
desires
whilst
on
the
other
hand
that
much
of
the
when
awake
the
thoughts
saved
us
as
surplus
from
the
day
only
reaches
presentation
in
dreams
with
the
help
of
repressed
erotic
desires
towards
the
explanation
of
this
statement
which
is
no
theoretical
postulate
it
must
be
remembered
that
no
other
class
of
instincts
has
required
so
vast
a
suppression
at
the
behest
of
civilization
as
the
sexual
whilst
their
mastery
by
the
highest
psychical
processes
are
in
most
persons
soonest
of
all
relinquished
since
we
have
learnt
to
understand
often
so
vague
in
its
expression
so
invariably
overlooked
and
misunderstood
we
are
justified
in
saying
that
nearly
every
civilized
person
has
retained
at
some
point
or
other
the
infantile
type
of
sex
life
thus
we
understand
that
repressed
infantile
sex
desires
furnish
the
most
frequent
and
most
powerful
impulses
for
the
formation
of
dreams
if
the
dream
which
is
the
expression
of
some
erotic
desire
succeeds
in
making
its
manifest
content
appear
innocently
asexual
it
is
only
possible
in
one
way
the
matter
of
these
sexual
presentations
can
not
be
exhibited
as
such
but
must
be
replaced
by
allusions
suggestions
and
similar
indirect
means
differing
from
other
cases
of
indirect
presentation
those
used
in
dreams
must
be
deprived
of
direct
understanding
the
means
of
presentation
which
answer
these
requirements
are
commonly
termed
symbols
a
special
interest
has
been
directed
towards
these
since
it
has
been
observed
that
the
dreamers
of
the
same
language
use
the
like
symbols
indeed
that
in
certain
cases
community
of
symbol
is
greater
than
community
of
speech
since
the
dreamers
do
not
themselves
know
the
meaning
of
the
symbols
they
use
it
remains
a
puzzle
whence
arises
their
relationship
with
what
they
replace
and
denote
the
fact
itself
is
undoubted
and
becomes
of
importance
for
the
technique
of
the
interpretation
of
dreams
since
by
the
aid
of
a
knowledge
of
this
symbolism
it
is
possible
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
elements
of
a
dream
or
parts
of
a
dream
occasionally
even
the
whole
dream
itself
without
having
to
question
the
dreamer
as
to
his
own
ideas
we
thus
come
near
to
the
popular
idea
of
an
interpretation
of
dreams
and
on
the
other
hand
possess
again
the
technique
of
the
ancients
among
whom
the
interpretation
of
dreams
was
identical
with
their
explanation
through
symbolism
though
the
study
of
dream
symbolism
is
far
removed
from
finality
we
now
possess
a
series
of
general
statements
and
of
particular
observations
which
are
quite
certain
there
are
symbols
which
practically
always
have
the
same
meaning
emperor
and
empress
king
and
queen
always
mean
the
parents
room
a
woman
and
so
on
the
sexes
are
represented
by
a
great
variety
of
symbols
many
of
which
would
be
at
first
quite
incomprehensible
had
not
the
clews
to
the
meaning
been
often
obtained
through
other
channels
there
are
symbols
of
universal
circulation
found
in
all
dreamers
of
one
range
of
speech
and
culture
there
are
others
of
the
narrowest
individual
significance
which
an
individual
has
built
up
out
of
his
own
material
in
the
first
class
those
can
be
differentiated
whose
claim
can
be
at
once
recognized
by
the
replacement
of
sexual
things
in
common
speech
those
for
instance
arising
from
agriculture
as
reproduction
seed
from
others
whose
sexual
references
appear
to
reach
back
to
the
earliest
times
and
to
the
obscurest
depths
of
our
the
power
of
building
symbols
in
both
these
special
forms
of
symbols
has
not
died
out
recently
discovered
things
like
the
airship
are
at
once
brought
into
universal
use
as
sex
symbols
it
would
be
quite
an
error
to
suppose
that
a
profounder
knowledge
of
dream
symbolism
the
language
of
dreams
would
make
us
independent
of
questioning
the
dreamer
regarding
his
impressions
about
the
dream
and
would
give
us
back
the
whole
technique
of
ancient
dream
interpreters
apart
from
individual
symbols
and
the
variations
in
the
use
of
what
is
general
one
never
knows
whether
an
element
in
the
dream
is
to
be
understood
symbolically
or
in
its
proper
meaning
the
whole
content
of
the
dream
is
certainly
not
to
be
interpreted
symbolically
the
knowledge
of
dream
symbols
will
only
help
us
in
understanding
portions
of
the
dream
content
and
does
not
render
the
use
of
the
technical
rules
previously
given
at
all
superfluous
but
it
must
be
of
the
greatest
service
in
interpreting
a
dream
just
when
the
impressions
of
the
dreamer
are
withheld
or
are
insufficient
dream
symbolism
proves
also
indispensable
for
understanding
the
typical
dreams
and
the
dreams
that
repeat
themselves
dream
symbolism
leads
us
far
beyond
the
dream
it
does
not
belong
only
to
dreams
but
is
likewise
dominant
in
legend
myth
and
saga
in
wit
and
in
folklore
it
compels
us
to
pursue
the
inner
meaning
of
the
dream
in
these
productions
but
we
must
acknowledge
that
symbolism
is
not
a
result
of
the
dream
work
but
is
a
peculiarity
probably
of
our
unconscious
thinking
which
furnishes
to
the
dream
work
the
matter
for
condensation
displacement

dramatization

iv
dream
analysis
perhaps
we
shall
now
begin
to
suspect
that
dream
interpretation
is
capable
of
giving
us
hints
about
the
structure
of
our
psychic
apparatus
which
we
have
thus
far
expected
in
vain
from
philosophy
we
shall
not
however
follow
this
track
but
return
to
our
original
problem
as
soon
as
we
have
cleared
up
the
subject
of
the
question
has
arisen
how
dreams
with
disagreeable
content
can
be
analyzed
as
the
fulfillment
of
wishes
we
see
now
that
this
is
possible
in
case
has
taken
place
in
case
the
disagreeable
content
serves
only
as
a
disguise
for
what
is
wished
keeping
in
mind
our
assumptions
in
regard
to
the
two
psychic
instances
we
may
now
proceed
to
say
disagreeable
dreams
as
a
matter
of
fact
contain
something
which
is
disagreeable
to
the
second
instance
but
which
at
the
same
time
fulfills
a
wish
of
the
first
instance
they
are
wish
dreams
in
the
sense
that
every
dream
originates
in
the
first
instance
while
the
second
instance
acts
towards
the
dream
only
in
repelling
not
in
a
creative
manner
if
we
limit
ourselves
to
a
consideration
of
what
the
second
instance
contributes
to
the
dream
we
can
never
understand
the
dream
if
we
do
so
all
the
riddles
which
the
authors
have
found
in
the
dream
remain
unsolved
that
the
dream
actually
has
a
secret
meaning
which
turns
out
to
be
the
fulfillment
of
a
wish
must
be
proved
afresh
for
every
case
by
means
of
an
analysis
i
therefore
select
several
dreams
which
have
painful
contents
and
attempt
an
analysis
of
them
they
are
partly
dreams
of
hysterical
subjects
which
require
long
preliminary
statements
and
now
and
then
also
an
examination
of
the
psychic
processes
which
occur
in
hysteria
i
can
not
however
avoid
this
added
difficulty
in
the
exposition
when
i
give
a
psychoneurotic
patient
analytical
treatment
dreams
are
always
as
i
have
said
the
subject
of
our
discussion
it
must
therefore
give
him
all
the
psychological
explanations
through
whose
aid
i
myself
have
come
to
an
understanding
of
his
symptoms
and
here
i
undergo
an
unsparing
criticism
which
is
perhaps
not
less
keen
than
that
i
must
expect
from
my
colleagues
contradiction
of
the
thesis
that
all
dreams
are
the
fulfillments
of
wishes
is
raised
by
my
patients
with
perfect
regularity
here
are
several
examples
of
the
dream
material
which
is
offered
me
to
refute
this
position
you
always
tell
me
that
the
dream
is
a
wish
fulfilled
begins
a
clever
lady
patient
now
i
shall
tell
you
a
dream
in
which
the
content
is
quite
the
opposite
in
which
a
wish
of
mine
is
fulfilled
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
your
theory
the
dream
is
as
follows
i
want
to
give
a
supper
but
having
nothing
at
hand
except
some
smoked
salmon
i
think
of
going
marketing
but
i
remember
that
it
is
sunday
afternoon
when
all
the
shops
are
closed
i
next
try
to
telephone
to
some
caterers
but
the
telephone
is
out
of
order
thus
i
must
resign
my
wish
to
give
a
supper
i
answer
of
course
that
only
the
analysis
can
decide
the
meaning
of
this
dream
although
i
admit
that
at
first
sight
it
seems
sensible
and
coherent
and
looks
like
the
opposite
of
a
but
what
occurrence
has
given
rise
to
this
dream
i
ask
you
know
that
the
stimulus
for
a
dream
always
lies
among
the
experiences
of
the
preceding
day
the
husband
of
the
patient
an
upright
and
conscientious
wholesale
butcher
had
told
her
the
day
before
that
he
is
growing
too
fat
and
that
he
must
therefore
begin
treatment
for
obesity
he
was
going
to
get
up
early
take
exercise
keep
to
a
strict
diet
and
above
all
accept
no
more
invitations
to
suppers
she
proceeds
laughingly
to
relate
how
her
husband
at
an
inn
table
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
artist
who
insisted
upon
painting
his
portrait
because
he
the
painter
had
never
found
such
an
expressive
head
but
her
husband
had
answered
in
his
rough
way
that
he
was
very
thankful
for
the
honor
but
that
he
was
quite
convinced
that
a
portion
of
the
backside
of
a
pretty
young
girl
would
please
the
artist
better
than
his
whole
face
she
said
that
she
was
at
the
time
very
much
in
love
with
her
husband
and
teased
him
a
good
deal
she
had
also
asked
him
not
to
send
her
any
caviare
what
does
that
mean
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
wanted
for
a
long
time
to
eat
a
caviare
sandwich
every
forenoon
but
had
grudged
herself
the
expense
of
course
she
would
at
once
get
the
caviare
from
her
husband
as
soon
as
she
asked
him
for
it
but
she
had
begged
him
on
the
contrary
not
to
send
her
the
caviare
in
order
that
she
might
tease
him
about
it
longer
this
explanation
seems
to
me
unadmitted
motives
are
in
the
habit
of
hiding
behind
such
unsatisfactory
explanations
we
are
reminded
of
subjects
hypnotized
by
bernheim
who
carried
out
a
posthypnotic
order
and
who
upon
being
asked
for
their
motives
instead
of
answering
i
do
not
know
why
i
did
that
had
to
invent
a
reason
that
was
obviously
inadequate
something
similar
is
probably
the
case
with
the
caviare
of
my
patient
i
see
that
she
is
compelled
to
create
an
unfulfilled
wish
in
life
her
dream
also
shows
the
reproduction
of
the
wish
as
accomplished
but
why
does
she
need
an
unfulfilled
wish
the
ideas
so
far
produced
are
insufficient
for
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
i
beg
for
more
after
a
short
pause
which
corresponds
to
the
overcoming
of
a
resistance
she
reports
further
that
the
day
before
she
had
made
a
visit
to
a
friend
of
whom
she
is
really
jealous
because
her
husband
is
always
praising
this
woman
so
much
fortunately
this
friend
is
very
lean
and
thin
and
her
husband
likes
figures
now
of
what
did
this
lean
friend
speak
naturally
of
her
wish
to
become
somewhat
stouter
she
also
asked
my
patient
when
are
you
going
to
invite
us
again
you
always
have
such
a
good
table
now
the
meaning
of
the
dream
is
clear
i
may
say
to
the
patient
it
is
just
as
though
you
had
thought
at
the
time
of
the
request
course
i
invite
you
so
you
can
eat
yourself
fat
at
my
house
and
become
still
more
pleasing
to
my
husband
i
would
rather
give
no
more
suppers
the
dream
then
tells
you
that
you
can
not
give
a
supper
thereby
fulfilling
your
wish
not
to
contribute
anything
to
the
rounding
out
of
your
friend
figure
the
resolution
of
your
husband
to
refuse
invitations
to
supper
for
the
sake
of
getting
thin
teaches
you
that
one
grows
fat
on
the
things
served
in
company
now
only
some
conversation
is
necessary
to
confirm
the
solution
the
smoked
salmon
in
the
dream
has
not
yet
been
traced
how
did
the
salmon
mentioned
in
the
dream
occur
to
you
smoked
salmon
is
the
favorite
dish
of
this
friend
she
answered
i
happen
to
know
the
lady
and
may
corroborate
this
by
saying
that
she
grudges
herself
the
salmon
just
as
much
as
my
patient
grudges
herself
the
caviare
the
dream
admits
of
still
another
and
more
exact
interpretation
which
is
necessitated
only
by
a
subordinate
circumstance
the
two
interpretations
do
not
contradict
one
another
but
rather
cover
each
other
and
furnish
a
neat
example
of
the
usual
ambiguity
of
dreams
as
well
as
of
all
other
psychopathological
formations
we
have
seen
that
at
the
same
time
that
she
dreams
of
the
denial
of
the
wish
the
patient
is
in
reality
occupied
in
securing
an
unfulfilled
wish
the
caviare
sandwiches
her
friend
too
had
expressed
a
wish
namely
to
get
fatter
and
it
would
not
surprise
us
if
our
lady
had
dreamt
that
the
wish
of
the
friend
was
not
being
fulfilled
for
it
is
her
own
wish
that
a
wish
of
her
friend
for
increase
in
weight
should
not
be
fulfilled
instead
of
this
however
she
dreams
that
one
of
her
own
wishes
is
not
fulfilled
the
dream
becomes
capable
of
a
new
interpretation
if
in
the
dream
she
does
not
intend
herself
but
her
friend
if
she
has
put
herself
in
the
place
of
her
friend
or
as
we
may
say
has
identified
herself
with
her
friend
i
think
she
has
actually
done
this
and
as
a
sign
of
this
identification
she
has
created
an
unfulfilled
wish
in
reality
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
hysterical
identification
to
clear
this
up
a
thorough
exposition
is
necessary
identification
is
a
highly
important
factor
in
the
mechanism
of
hysterical
symptoms
by
this
means
patients
are
enabled
in
their
symptoms
to
represent
not
merely
their
own
experiences
but
the
experiences
of
a
great
number
of
other
persons
and
can
suffer
as
it
were
for
a
whole
mass
of
people
and
fill
all
the
parts
of
a
drama
by
means
of
their
own
personalities
alone
it
will
here
be
objected
that
this
is
hysterical
imitation
the
ability
of
hysteric
subjects
to
copy
all
the
symptoms
which
impress
them
when
they
occur
in
others
as
though
their
pity
were
stimulated
to
the
point
of
reproduction
but
this
only
indicates
the
way
in
which
the
psychic
process
is
discharged
in
hysterical
imitation
the
way
in
which
a
psychic
act
proceeds
and
the
act
itself
are
two
different
things
the
latter
is
slightly
more
complicated
than
one
is
apt
to
imagine
the
imitation
of
hysterical
subjects
to
be
it
corresponds
to
an
unconscious
concluded
process
as
an
example
will
show
the
physician
who
has
a
female
patient
with
a
particular
kind
of
twitching
lodged
in
the
company
of
other
patients
in
the
same
room
of
the
hospital
is
not
surprised
when
some
morning
he
learns
that
this
peculiar
hysterical
attack
has
found
imitations
he
simply
says
to
himself
the
others
have
seen
her
and
have
done
likewise
that
is
psychic
infection
yes
but
psychic
infection
proceeds
in
somewhat
the
following
manner
as
a
rule
patients
know
more
about
one
another
than
the
physician
knows
about
each
of
them
and
they
are
concerned
about
each
other
when
the
visit
of
the
doctor
is
over
some
of
them
have
an
attack
soon
it
is
known
among
the
rest
that
a
letter
from
home
a
return
of
lovesickness
or
the
like
is
the
cause
of
it
their
sympathy
is
aroused
and
the
following
syllogism
which
does
not
reach
consciousness
is
completed
in
them
if
it
is
possible
to
have
this
kind
of
an
attack
from
such
causes
i
too
may
have
this
kind
of
an
attack
for
i
have
the
same
reasons
if
this
were
a
cycle
capable
of
becoming
conscious
it
would
perhaps
express
itself
in
of
getting
the
same
attack
but
it
takes
place
in
another
psychic
sphere
and
therefore
ends
in
the
realization
of
the
dreaded
symptom
identification
is
therefore
not
a
simple
imitation
but
a
sympathy
based
upon
the
same
etiological
claim
it
expresses
an
as
though
and
refers
to
some
common
quality
which
has
remained
in
the
unconscious
identification
is
most
often
used
in
hysteria
to
express
sexual
community
an
hysterical
woman
identifies
herself
most
readily
although
not
exclusively
with
persons
with
whom
she
has
had
sexual
relations
or
who
have
sexual
intercourse
with
the
same
persons
as
herself
language
takes
such
a
conception
into
consideration
two
lovers
are
one
in
the
hysterical
phantasy
as
well
as
in
the
dream
it
is
sufficient
for
the
identification
if
one
thinks
of
sexual
relations
whether
or
not
they
become
real
the
patient
then
only
follows
the
rules
of
the
hysterical
thought
processes
when
she
gives
expression
to
her
jealousy
of
her
friend
which
moreover
she
herself
admits
to
be
unjustified
in
that
she
puts
herself
in
her
place
and
identifies
herself
with
her
by
creating
a
symptom
the
denied
wish
i
might
further
clarify
the
process
specifically
as
follows
she
puts
herself
in
the
place
of
her
friend
in
the
dream
because
her
friend
has
taken
her
own
place
relation
to
her
husband
and
because
she
would
like
to
take
her
friend
place
in
the
esteem
of
her
husband
the
contradiction
to
my
theory
of
dreams
in
the
case
of
another
female
patient
the
most
witty
among
all
my
dreamers
was
solved
in
a
simpler
manner
although
according
to
the
scheme
that
the
of
one
wish
signifies
the
fulfillment
of
another
i
had
one
day
explained
to
her
that
the
dream
is
a
wish
of
fulfillment
the
next
day
she
brought
me
a
dream
to
the
effect
that
she
was
traveling
with
her
to
their
common
summer
resort
now
i
knew
that
she
had
struggled
violently
against
spending
the
summer
in
the
neighborhood
of
her
i
also
knew
that
she
had
luckily
avoided
her
by
renting
an
estate
in
a
country
resort
now
the
dream
reversed
this
solution
was
not
this
in
the
flattest
contradiction
to
my
theory
of
in
the
dream
certainly
it
was
only
necessary
to
draw
the
inferences
from
this
dream
in
order
to
get
at
its
interpretation
according
to
this
dream
i
was
in
the
wrong
was
thus
her
wish
that
i
should
be
in
the
wrong
and
this
wish
the
dream
showed
her
as
but
the
wish
that
i
should
be
in
the
wrong
which
was
fulfilled
in
the
theme
of
the
country
home
referred
to
a
more
serious
matter
at
that
time
i
had
made
up
my
mind
from
the
material
furnished
by
her
analysis
that
something
of
significance
for
her
illness
must
have
occurred
at
a
certain
time
in
her
life
she
had
denied
it
because
it
was
not
present
in
her
memory
we
soon
came
to
see
that
i
was
in
the
right
her
wish
that
i
should
be
in
the
wrong
which
is
transformed
into
the
dream
thus
corresponded
to
the
justifiable
wish
that
those
things
which
at
the
time
had
only
been
suspected
had
never
occurred
at
all
without
an
analysis
and
merely
by
means
of
an
assumption
i
took
the
liberty
of
interpreting
a
little
occurrence
in
the
case
of
a
friend
who
had
been
my
colleague
through
the
eight
classes
of
the
gymnasium
he
once
heard
a
lecture
of
mine
delivered
to
a
small
assemblage
on
the
novel
subject
of
the
dream
as
the
fulfillment
of
a
wish
he
went
home
dreamt
he
had
lost
all
his
he
was
a
lawyer
and
then
complained
to
me
about
it
i
took
refuge
in
the
evasion
one
ca
win
all
one
suits
but
i
thought
to
myself
if
for
eight
years
i
sat
as
primus
on
the
first
bench
while
he
moved
around
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
class
may
he
not
naturally
have
had
a
wish
from
his
boyhood
days
that
i
too
might
for
once
completely
disgrace
myself
in
the
same
way
another
dream
of
a
more
gloomy
character
was
offered
me
by
a
female
patient
as
a
contradiction
to
my
theory
of
the
the
patient
a
young
girl
began
as
follows
you
remember
that
my
sister
has
now
only
one
boy
charles
she
lost
the
elder
one
otto
while
i
was
still
at
her
house
otto
was
my
favorite
it
was
i
who
really
brought
him
up
i
like
the
other
little
fellow
too
but
of
course
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
dead
one
now
i
dreamt
last
night
that
saw
charles
lying
dead
before
me
he
was
lying
in
his
little
coffin
his
hands
folded
there
were
candles
all
about
and
in
short
it
was
just
like
the
time
of
little
otto
death
which
shocked
me
so
now
tell
me
what
does
this
mean
you
know
me
am
i
really
bad
enough
to
wish
my
sister
to
lose
the
only
child
she
has
left
or
does
the
dream
mean
that
i
wish
charles
to
be
dead
rather
than
otto
whom
i
like
so
much
better
i
assured
her
that
this
interpretation
was
impossible
after
some
reflection
i
was
able
to
give
her
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
which
i
subsequently
made
her
confirm
having
become
an
orphan
at
an
early
age
the
girl
had
been
brought
up
in
the
house
of
a
much
older
sister
and
had
met
among
the
friends
and
visitors
who
came
to
the
house
a
man
who
made
a
lasting
impression
upon
her
heart
it
looked
for
a
time
as
though
these
barely
expressed
relations
were
to
end
in
marriage
but
this
happy
culmination
was
frustrated
by
the
sister
whose
motives
have
never
found
a
complete
explanation
after
the
break
the
man
who
was
loved
by
our
patient
avoided
the
house
she
herself
became
independent
some
time
after
little
otto
death
to
whom
her
affection
had
now
turned
but
she
did
not
succeed
in
freeing
herself
from
the
inclination
for
her
sister
friend
in
which
she
had
become
involved
her
pride
commanded
her
to
avoid
him
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
transfer
her
love
to
the
other
suitors
who
presented
themselves
in
order
whenever
the
man
whom
she
loved
who
was
a
member
of
the
literary
profession
announced
a
lecture
anywhere
she
was
sure
to
be
found
in
the
audience
she
also
seized
every
other
opportunity
to
see
him
from
a
distance
unobserved
by
him
i
remembered
that
on
the
day
before
she
had
told
me
that
the
professor
was
going
to
a
certain
concert
and
that
she
was
also
going
there
in
order
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
him
this
was
on
the
day
of
the
dream
and
the
concert
was
to
take
place
on
the
day
on
which
she
told
me
the
dream
i
could
now
easily
see
the
correct
interpretation
and
i
asked
her
whether
she
could
think
of
any
event
which
had
happened
after
the
death
of
little
otto
she
answered
immediately
certainly
at
that
time
the
professor
returned
after
a
long
absence
and
i
saw
him
once
more
beside
the
coffin
of
little
otto
it
was
exactly
as
i
had
expected
i
interpreted
the
dream
in
the
following
manner
if
now
the
other
boy
were
to
die
the
same
thing
would
be
repeated
you
would
spend
the
day
with
your
sister
the
professor
would
surely
come
in
order
to
offer
condolence
and
you
would
see
him
again
under
the
same
circumstances
as
at
that
time
the
dream
signifies
nothing
but
this
wish
of
yours
to
see
him
again
against
which
you
are
fighting
inwardly
i
know
that
you
are
carrying
the
ticket
for
concert
in
your
bag
your
dream
is
a
dream
of
impatience
it
has
anticipated
the
meeting
which
is
to
take
place
by
several
hours
in
order
to
disguise
her
wish
she
had
obviously
selected
a
situation
in
which
wishes
of
that
sort
are
commonly
suppressed
a
situation
which
is
so
filled
with
sorrow
that
love
is
not
thought
of
and
yet
it
is
very
easily
probable
that
even
in
the
actual
situation
at
the
bier
of
the
second
more
dearly
loved
boy
which
the
dream
copied
faithfully
she
had
not
been
able
to
suppress
her
feelings
of
affection
for
the
visitor
whom
she
had
missed
for
so
long
a
time
a
different
explanation
was
found
in
the
case
of
a
similar
dream
of
another
female
patient
who
was
distinguished
in
her
earlier
years
by
her
quick
wit
and
her
cheerful
demeanors
and
who
still
showed
these
qualities
at
least
in
the
notion
which
occurred
to
her
in
the
course
of
treatment
in
connection
with
a
longer
dream
it
seemed
to
this
lady
that
she
saw
her
daughter
lying
dead
before
her
in
a
box
she
was
strongly
inclined
to
convert
this
into
an
objection
to
the
theory
of
but
herself
suspected
that
the
detail
of
the
box
must
lead
to
a
different
conception
of
the
dream
in
the
course
of
the
analysis
it
occurred
to
her
that
on
the
evening
before
the
conversation
of
the
company
had
turned
upon
the
english
word
box
and
upon
the
numerous
translations
of
it
into
german
such
as
box
theater
box
chest
box
on
the
ear
from
other
components
of
the
same
dream
it
is
now
possible
to
add
that
the
lady
had
guessed
the
relationship
between
the
english
word
box
and
the
german
and
had
then
been
haunted
by
the
memory
that
as
well
as
box
is
used
in
vulgar
speech
to
designate
the
female
genital
organ
it
was
therefore
possible
making
a
certain
allowance
for
her
notions
on
the
subject
of
topographical
anatomy
to
assume
that
the
child
in
the
box
signified
a
child
in
the
womb
of
the
mother
at
this
stage
of
the
explanation
she
no
longer
denied
that
the
picture
of
the
dream
really
corresponded
to
one
of
her
wishes
like
so
many
other
young
women
she
was
by
no
means
happy
when
she
became
pregnant
and
admitted
to
me
more
than
once
the
wish
that
her
child
might
die
before
its
birth
in
a
fit
of
anger
following
a
violent
scene
with
her
husband
she
had
even
struck
her
abdomen
with
her
fists
in
order
to
hit
the
child
within
the
dead
child
was
therefore
really
the
fulfillment
of
a
wish
but
a
wish
which
had
been
put
aside
for
fifteen
years
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
fulfillment
of
the
wish
was
no
longer
recognized
after
so
long
an
interval
for
there
had
been
many
changes
meanwhile
the
group
of
dreams
to
which
the
two
last
mentioned
belong
having
as
content
the
death
of
beloved
relatives
will
be
considered
again
under
the
head
of
typical
dreams
i
shall
there
be
able
to
show
by
new
examples
that
in
spite
of
their
undesirable
content
all
these
dreams
must
be
interpreted
as
for
the
following
dream
which
again
was
told
me
in
order
to
deter
me
from
a
hasty
generalization
of
the
theory
of
wishing
in
dreams
i
am
indebted
not
to
a
patient
but
to
an
intelligent
jurist
of
my
acquaintance
my
informant
tells
me
i
am
walking
in
front
of
my
house
with
a
lady
on
my
arm
here
a
closed
wagon
is
waiting
a
gentleman
steps
up
to
me
gives
his
authority
as
an
agent
of
the
police
and
demands
that
i
should
follow
him
i
only
ask
for
time
in
which
to
arrange
my
can
you
possibly
suppose
this
is
a
wish
of
mine
to
be
arrested
of
course
not
i
must
admit
do
you
happen
to
know
upon
what
charge
you
were
arrested
yes
i
believe
for
infanticide
infanticide
but
you
know
that
only
a
mother
can
commit
this
crime
upon
her
newly
born
child
that
is
true
and
under
what
circumstances
did
you
dream
what
happened
on
the
evening
before
i
would
rather
not
tell
you
that
it
is
a
delicate
matter
but
i
must
have
it
otherwise
we
must
forgo
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
well
then
i
will
tell
you
i
spent
the
night
not
at
home
but
at
the
house
of
a
lady
who
means
very
much
to
me
when
we
awoke
in
the
morning
something
again
passed
between
us
then
i
went
to
sleep
again
and
dreamt
what
i
have
told
you
the
woman
is
married
yes
and
you
do
not
wish
her
to
conceive
a
child
no
that
might
betray
us
then
you
do
not
practice
normal
coitus
i
take
the
precaution
to
withdraw
before
ejaculation
am
i
permitted
to
assume
that
you
did
this
trick
several
times
during
the
night
and
that
in
the
morning
you
were
not
quite
sure
whether
you
had
succeeded
that
might
be
the
case
then
your
dream
is
the
fulfillment
of
a
wish
by
means
of
it
you
secure
the
assurance
that
you
have
not
begotten
a
child
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
that
you
have
killed
a
child
i
can
easily
demonstrate
the
connecting
links
do
you
remember
a
few
days
ago
we
were
talking
about
the
distress
of
matrimony
ehenot
and
about
the
inconsistency
of
permitting
the
practice
of
coitus
as
long
as
no
impregnation
takes
place
while
every
delinquency
after
the
ovum
and
the
semen
meet
and
a
foetus
is
formed
is
punished
as
a
crime
in
connection
with
this
we
also
recalled
the
mediæval
controversy
about
the
moment
of
time
at
which
the
soul
is
really
lodged
in
the
foetus
since
the
concept
of
murder
becomes
admissible
only
from
that
point
on
doubtless
you
also
know
the
gruesome
poem
by
lenau
which
puts
infanticide
and
the
prevention
of
children
on
the
same
plane
strangely
enough
i
had
happened
to
think
of
lenau
during
the
afternoon
another
echo
of
your
dream
and
now
i
shall
demonstrate
to
you
another
subordinate
in
your
dream
you
walk
in
front
of
your
house
with
the
lady
on
your
arm
so
you
take
her
home
instead
of
spending
the
night
at
her
house
as
you
do
in
actuality
the
fact
that
the
which
is
the
essence
of
the
dream
disguises
itself
in
such
an
unpleasant
form
has
perhaps
more
than
one
reason
from
my
essay
on
the
etiology
of
anxiety
neuroses
you
will
see
that
i
note
interrupted
coitus
as
one
of
the
factors
which
cause
the
development
of
neurotic
fear
it
would
be
consistent
with
this
that
if
after
repeated
cohabitation
of
the
kind
mentioned
you
should
be
left
in
an
uncomfortable
mood
which
now
becomes
an
element
in
the
composition
of
your
dream
you
also
make
use
of
this
unpleasant
state
of
mind
to
conceal
the
furthermore
the
mention
of
infanticide
has
not
yet
been
explained
why
does
this
crime
which
is
peculiar
to
females
occur
to
you
i
shall
confess
to
you
that
i
was
involved
in
such
an
affair
years
ago
through
my
fault
a
girl
tried
to
protect
herself
from
the
consequences
of
a
with
me
by
securing
an
abortion
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
carrying
out
the
plan
but
i
was
naturally
for
a
long
time
worried
lest
the
affair
might
be
discovered
i
understand
this
recollection
furnished
a
second
reason
why
the
supposition
that
you
had
done
your
trick
badly
must
have
been
painful
to
you
a
young
physician
who
had
heard
this
dream
of
my
colleague
when
it
was
told
must
have
felt
implicated
by
it
for
he
hastened
to
imitate
it
in
a
dream
of
his
own
applying
its
mode
of
thinking
to
another
subject
the
day
before
he
had
handed
in
a
declaration
of
his
income
which
was
perfectly
honest
because
he
had
little
to
declare
he
dreamt
that
an
acquaintance
of
his
came
from
a
meeting
of
the
tax
commission
and
informed
him
that
all
the
other
declarations
of
income
had
passed
uncontested
but
that
his
own
had
awakened
general
suspicion
and
that
he
would
be
punished
with
a
heavy
fine
the
dream
is
a
fulfillment
of
the
wish
to
be
known
as
a
physician
with
a
large
income
it
likewise
recalls
the
story
of
the
young
girl
who
was
advised
against
accepting
her
suitor
because
he
was
a
man
of
quick
temper
who
would
surely
treat
her
to
blows
after
they
were
married
the
answer
of
the
girl
was
i
wish
he
strike
me
her
wish
to
be
married
is
so
strong
that
she
takes
into
the
bargain
the
discomfort
which
is
said
to
be
connected
with
matrimony
and
which
is
predicted
for
her
and
even
raises
it
to
a
wish
if
i
group
the
very
frequently
occurring
dreams
of
this
sort
which
seem
flatly
to
contradict
my
theory
in
that
they
contain
the
denial
of
a
wish
or
some
occurrence
decidedly
unwished
for
under
the
head
of
counter
i
observe
that
they
may
all
be
referred
to
two
principles
of
which
one
has
not
yet
been
mentioned
although
it
plays
a
large
part
in
the
dreams
of
human
beings
one
of
the
motives
inspiring
these
dreams
is
the
wish
that
i
should
appear
in
the
wrong
these
dreams
regularly
occur
in
the
course
of
my
treatment
if
the
patient
shows
a
resistance
against
me
and
i
can
count
with
a
large
degree
of
certainty
upon
causing
such
a
dream
after
i
have
once
explained
to
the
patient
my
theory
that
the
dream
is
a
i
may
even
expect
this
to
be
the
case
in
a
dream
merely
in
order
to
fulfill
the
wish
that
i
may
appear
in
the
wrong
the
last
dream
which
i
shall
tell
from
those
occurring
in
the
course
of
treatment
again
shows
this
very
thing
a
young
girl
who
has
struggled
hard
to
continue
my
treatment
against
the
will
of
her
relatives
and
the
authorities
whom
she
had
consulted
dreams
as
follows
is
forbidden
at
home
to
come
to
me
any
more
she
then
reminds
me
of
the
promise
i
made
her
to
treat
her
for
nothing
if
necessary
and
i
say
to
her
i
can
show
no
consideration
in
money
matters
it
is
not
at
all
easy
in
this
case
to
demonstrate
the
fulfillment
of
a
wish
but
in
all
cases
of
this
kind
there
is
a
second
problem
the
solution
of
which
helps
also
to
solve
the
first
where
does
she
get
the
words
which
she
puts
into
my
mouth
of
course
i
have
never
told
her
anything
like
that
but
one
of
her
brothers
the
very
one
who
has
the
greatest
influence
over
her
has
been
kind
enough
to
make
this
remark
about
me
it
is
then
the
purpose
of
the
dream
that
this
brother
should
remain
in
the
right
and
she
does
not
try
to
justify
this
brother
merely
in
the
dream
it
is
her
purpose
in
life
and
the
motive
for
her
being
ill
the
other
motive
for
counter
is
so
clear
that
there
is
danger
of
overlooking
it
as
for
some
time
happened
in
my
own
case
in
the
sexual
of
many
people
there
is
a
masochistic
component
which
has
arisen
through
the
conversion
of
the
aggressive
sadistic
component
into
its
opposite
such
people
are
called
ideal
masochists
if
they
seek
pleasure
not
in
the
bodily
pain
which
may
be
inflicted
upon
them
but
in
humiliation
and
in
chastisement
of
the
soul
it
is
obvious
that
such
persons
can
have
counter
and
disagreeable
dreams
which
however
for
them
are
nothing
but
affording
satisfaction
for
their
masochistic
inclinations
here
is
such
a
dream
a
young
man
who
has
in
earlier
years
tormented
his
elder
brother
towards
whom
he
was
homosexually
inclined
but
who
had
undergone
a
complete
change
of
character
has
the
following
dream
which
consists
of
three
parts
is
insulted
by
his
adults
are
caressing
each
other
with
homosexual
brother
has
sold
the
enterprise
whose
management
the
young
man
reserved
for
his
own
he
awakens
from
the
dream
with
the
most
unpleasant
feelings
and
yet
it
is
a
masochistic
which
might
be
translated
it
would
serve
me
quite
right
if
my
brother
were
to
make
that
sale
against
my
interest
as
a
punishment
for
all
the
torments
which
he
has
suffered
at
my
hands
i
hope
that
the
above
discussion
and
examples
will
suffice
until
further
objection
can
be
raised
to
make
it
seem
credible
that
even
dreams
with
a
painful
content
are
to
be
analyzed
as
the
fulfillments
of
wishes
nor
will
it
seem
a
matter
of
chance
that
in
the
course
of
interpretation
one
always
happens
upon
subjects
of
which
one
does
not
like
to
speak
or
think
the
disagreeable
sensation
which
such
dreams
arouse
is
simply
identical
with
the
antipathy
which
endeavors
usually
with
success
to
restrain
us
from
the
treatment
or
discussion
of
such
subjects
and
which
must
be
overcome
by
all
of
us
if
in
spite
of
its
unpleasantness
we
find
it
necessary
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
but
this
disagreeable
sensation
which
occurs
also
in
dreams
does
not
preclude
the
existence
of
a
wish
every
one
has
wishes
which
he
would
not
like
to
tell
to
others
which
he
does
not
want
to
admit
even
to
himself
we
are
on
other
grounds
justified
in
connecting
the
disagreeable
character
of
all
these
dreams
with
the
fact
of
dream
disfigurement
and
in
concluding
that
these
dreams
are
distorted
and
that
the
in
them
is
disguised
until
recognition
is
impossible
for
no
other
reason
than
that
a
repugnance
a
will
to
suppress
exists
in
relation
to
the
of
the
dream
or
in
relation
to
the
wish
which
the
dream
creates
dream
disfigurement
then
turns
out
in
reality
to
be
an
act
of
the
censor
we
shall
take
into
consideration
everything
which
the
analysis
of
disagreeable
dreams
has
brought
to
light
if
we
reword
our
formula
as
follows
dream
is
the
disguised
fulfillment
of
a
suppressed
repressed
now
there
still
remain
as
a
particular
species
of
dreams
with
painful
content
dreams
of
anxiety
the
inclusion
of
which
under
dreams
of
wishing
will
find
least
acceptance
with
the
uninitiated
but
i
can
settle
the
problem
of
anxiety
dreams
in
very
short
order
for
what
they
may
reveal
is
not
a
new
aspect
of
the
dream
problem
it
is
a
question
in
their
case
of
understanding
neurotic
anxiety
in
general
the
fear
which
we
experience
in
the
dream
is
only
seemingly
explained
by
the
dream
content
if
we
subject
the
content
of
the
dream
to
analysis
we
become
aware
that
the
dream
fear
is
no
more
justified
by
the
dream
content
than
the
fear
in
a
phobia
is
justified
by
the
idea
upon
which
the
phobia
depends
for
example
it
is
true
that
it
is
possible
to
fall
out
of
a
window
and
that
some
care
must
be
exercised
when
one
is
near
a
window
but
it
is
inexplicable
why
the
anxiety
in
the
corresponding
phobia
is
so
great
and
why
it
follows
its
victims
to
an
extent
so
much
greater
than
is
warranted
by
its
origin
the
same
explanation
then
which
applies
to
the
phobia
applies
also
to
the
dream
of
anxiety
in
both
cases
the
anxiety
is
only
superficially
attached
to
the
idea
which
accompanies
it
and
comes
from
another
source
on
account
of
the
intimate
relation
of
dream
fear
to
neurotic
fear
discussion
of
the
former
obliges
me
to
refer
to
the
latter
in
a
little
essay
on
the
anxiety
neurosis
i
maintained
that
neurotic
fear
has
its
origin
in
the
sexual
life
and
corresponds
to
a
libido
which
has
been
turned
away
from
its
object
and
has
not
succeeded
in
being
applied
from
this
formula
which
has
since
proved
its
validity
more
and
more
clearly
we
may
deduce
the
conclusion
that
the
content
of
anxiety
dreams
is
of
a
sexual
nature
the
libido
belonging
to
which
content
has
been
transformed
into
fear
to
sit
for
the
painter
goethe
and
if
he
has
no
backside
how
can
the
nobleman
sit
i
myself
regret
the
introduction
of
such
passages
from
the
psychopathology
of
hysteria
which
because
of
their
fragmentary
representation
and
of
being
torn
from
all
connection
with
the
subject
can
not
have
a
very
enlightening
influence
if
these
passages
are
capable
of
throwing
light
upon
the
intimate
relations
between
the
dream
and
the
psychoneuroses
they
have
served
the
purpose
for
which
i
have
taken
them
up
something
like
the
smoked
salmon
in
the
dream
of
the
deferred
supper
it
often
happens
that
a
dream
is
told
incompletely
and
that
a
recollection
of
the
omitted
portions
appear
only
in
the
course
of
the
analysis
these
portions
subsequently
fitted
in
regularly
furnish
the
key
to
the
interpretation
below
about
forgetting
in
dreams
similar
counter
have
been
repeatedly
reported
to
me
within
the
last
few
years
by
my
pupils
who
thus
reacted
to
their
first
encounter
with
the
wish
theory
of
the
dream
see
papers
on
hysteria
and
other
translated
by
brill
of
nervous
and
mental
monograph
series
v
sex
in
dreams
the
more
one
is
occupied
with
the
solution
of
dreams
the
more
willing
one
must
become
to
acknowledge
that
the
majority
of
the
dreams
of
adults
treat
of
sexual
material
and
give
expression
to
erotic
wishes
only
one
who
really
analyzes
dreams
that
is
to
say
who
pushes
forward
from
their
manifest
content
to
the
latent
dream
thoughts
can
form
an
opinion
on
this
subject
never
the
person
who
is
satisfied
with
registering
the
manifest
content
as
for
example
näcke
in
his
works
on
sexual
dreams
let
us
recognize
at
once
that
this
fact
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
but
that
it
is
in
complete
harmony
with
the
fundamental
assumptions
of
dream
explanation
no
other
impulse
has
had
to
undergo
so
much
suppression
from
the
time
of
childhood
as
the
sex
impulse
in
its
numerous
components
from
no
other
impulse
have
survived
so
many
and
such
intense
unconscious
wishes
which
now
act
in
the
sleeping
state
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
dreams
in
dream
interpretation
this
significance
of
sexual
complexes
must
never
be
forgotten
nor
must
they
of
course
be
exaggerated
to
the
point
of
being
considered
exclusive
of
many
dreams
it
can
be
ascertained
by
a
careful
interpretation
that
they
are
even
to
be
taken
bisexually
inasmuch
as
they
result
in
an
irrefutable
secondary
interpretation
in
which
they
realize
homosexual
feelings
that
is
feelings
that
are
common
to
the
normal
sexual
activity
of
the
dreaming
person
but
that
all
dreams
are
to
be
interpreted
bisexually
seems
to
me
to
be
a
generalization
as
indemonstrable
as
it
is
improbable
which
i
should
not
like
to
support
above
all
i
should
not
know
how
to
dispose
of
the
apparent
fact
that
there
are
many
dreams
satisfying
other
than
in
the
widest
sense
erotic
needs
as
dreams
of
hunger
thirst
convenience
likewise
the
similar
assertions
that
behind
every
dream
one
finds
the
death
sentence
stekel
and
that
every
dream
shows
a
continuation
from
the
feminine
to
the
masculine
line
adler
seem
to
me
to
proceed
far
beyond
what
is
admissible
in
the
interpretation
of
dreams
we
have
already
asserted
elsewhere
that
dreams
which
are
conspicuously
innocent
invariably
embody
coarse
erotic
wishes
and
we
might
confirm
this
by
means
of
numerous
fresh
examples
but
many
dreams
which
appear
indifferent
and
which
would
never
be
suspected
of
any
particular
significance
can
be
traced
back
after
analysis
to
unmistakably
sexual
which
are
often
of
an
unexpected
nature
for
example
who
would
suspect
a
sexual
wish
in
the
following
dream
until
the
interpretation
had
been
worked
out
the
dreamer
relates
two
stately
palaces
stands
a
little
house
receding
somewhat
whose
doors
are
closed
my
wife
leads
me
a
little
way
along
the
street
up
to
the
little
house
and
pushes
in
the
door
and
then
i
slip
quickly
and
easily
into
the
interior
of
a
courtyard
that
slants
obliquely
any
one
who
has
had
experience
in
the
translating
of
dreams
will
of
course
immediately
perceive
that
penetrating
into
narrow
spaces
and
opening
locked
doors
belong
to
the
commonest
sexual
symbolism
and
will
easily
find
in
this
dream
a
representation
of
attempted
coition
from
behind
between
the
two
stately
buttocks
of
the
female
body
the
narrow
slanting
passage
is
of
course
the
vagina
the
assistance
attributed
to
the
wife
of
the
dreamer
requires
the
interpretation
that
in
reality
it
is
only
consideration
for
the
wife
which
is
responsible
for
the
detention
from
such
an
attempt
moreover
inquiry
shows
that
on
the
previous
day
a
young
girl
had
entered
the
household
of
the
dreamer
who
had
pleased
him
and
who
had
given
him
the
impression
that
she
would
not
be
altogether
opposed
to
an
approach
of
this
sort
the
little
house
between
the
two
palaces
is
taken
from
a
reminiscence
of
the
hradschin
in
prague
and
thus
points
again
to
the
girl
who
is
a
native
of
that
city
if
with
my
patients
i
emphasize
the
frequency
of
the
oedipus
dream
of
having
sexual
intercourse
with
one
mother
i
get
the
answer
i
can
not
remember
such
a
dream
immediately
afterwards
however
there
arises
the
recollection
of
another
disguised
and
indifferent
dream
which
has
been
dreamed
repeatedly
by
the
patient
and
the
analysis
shows
it
to
be
a
dream
of
this
same
content
that
is
another
oedipus
dream
i
can
assure
the
reader
that
veiled
dreams
of
sexual
intercourse
with
the
mother
are
a
great
deal
more
frequent
than
open
ones
to
the
same
effect
there
are
dreams
about
landscapes
and
localities
in
which
emphasis
is
always
laid
upon
the
assurance
i
have
been
there
before
in
this
case
the
locality
is
always
the
genital
organ
of
the
mother
it
can
indeed
be
asserted
with
such
certainty
of
no
other
locality
that
one
has
been
there
before
a
large
number
of
dreams
often
full
of
fear
which
are
concerned
with
passing
through
narrow
spaces
or
with
staying
in
the
water
are
based
upon
fancies
about
the
embryonic
life
about
the
sojourn
in
the
womb
and
about
the
act
of
birth
the
following
is
the
dream
of
a
young
man
who
in
his
fancy
has
already
while
in
embryo
taken
advantage
of
his
opportunity
to
spy
upon
an
act
of
coition
between
his
parents
he
is
in
a
deep
shaft
in
which
there
is
a
window
as
in
the
semmering
tunnel
at
first
he
sees
an
empty
landscape
through
this
window
and
then
he
composes
a
picture
into
it
which
is
immediately
at
hand
and
which
fills
out
the
empty
space
the
picture
represents
a
field
which
is
being
thoroughly
harrowed
by
an
implement
and
the
delightful
air
the
accompanying
idea
of
hard
work
and
the
clods
of
earth
make
a
pleasant
impression
he
then
goes
on
and
sees
a
primary
school
opened
and
he
is
surprised
that
so
much
attention
is
devoted
in
it
to
the
sexual
feelings
of
the
child
which
makes
him
think
of
me
here
is
a
pretty
of
a
female
patient
which
was
turned
to
extraordinary
account
in
the
course
of
treatment
her
summer
resort
at
the
lake
she
hurls
herself
into
the
dark
water
at
a
place
where
the
pale
moon
is
reflected
in
the
dreams
of
this
sort
are
parturition
dreams
their
interpretation
is
accomplished
by
reversing
the
fact
reported
in
the
manifest
dream
content
thus
instead
of
throwing
one
self
into
the
water
read
coming
out
of
the
water
that
is
being
born
the
place
from
which
one
is
born
is
recognized
if
one
thinks
of
the
bad
sense
of
the
french
la
lune
the
pale
moon
thus
becomes
the
white
bottom
popo
which
the
child
soon
recognizes
as
the
place
from
which
it
came
now
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
the
patient
wishing
to
be
born
at
her
summer
resort
i
asked
the
dreamer
this
and
she
answered
without
hesitation
the
treatment
made
me
as
though
i
were
born
again
thus
the
dream
becomes
an
invitation
to
continue
the
cure
at
this
summer
resort
that
is
to
visit
her
there
perhaps
it
also
contains
a
very
bashful
allusion
to
the
wish
to
become
a
mother
herself
another
dream
of
parturition
with
its
interpretation
i
take
from
the
work
of
jones
she
stood
at
the
seashore
watching
a
small
boy
who
seemed
to
be
hers
wading
into
the
water
this
he
did
till
the
water
covered
him
and
she
could
only
see
his
head
bobbing
up
and
down
near
the
surface
the
scene
then
changed
to
the
crowded
hall
of
a
hotel
her
husband
left
her
and
she
into
conversation
with
a
stranger
the
second
half
of
the
dream
was
discovered
in
the
analysis
to
represent
a
flight
from
her
husband
and
the
entering
into
intimate
relations
with
a
third
person
behind
whom
was
plainly
indicated
mr
x
brother
mentioned
in
a
former
dream
the
first
part
of
the
dream
was
a
fairly
evident
birth
phantasy
in
dreams
as
in
mythology
the
delivery
of
a
child
the
uterine
waters
is
commonly
presented
by
distortion
as
the
entry
of
the
child
water
among
many
others
the
births
of
adonis
osiris
moses
and
bacchus
are
illustrations
of
this
the
bobbing
up
and
down
of
the
head
in
the
water
at
once
recalled
to
the
patient
the
sensation
of
quickening
she
had
experienced
in
her
only
pregnancy
thinking
of
the
boy
going
into
the
water
induced
a
reverie
in
which
she
saw
herself
taking
him
out
of
the
water
carrying
him
into
the
nursery
washing
him
and
dressing
him
and
installing
him
in
her
household
the
second
half
of
the
dream
therefore
represents
thoughts
concerning
the
elopement
which
belonged
to
the
first
half
of
the
underlying
latent
content
the
first
half
of
the
dream
corresponded
with
the
second
half
of
the
latent
content
the
birth
phantasy
besides
this
inversion
in
order
further
inversions
took
place
in
each
half
of
the
dream
in
the
first
half
the
child
the
water
and
then
his
head
bobbed
in
the
underlying
dream
thoughts
first
the
quickening
occurred
and
then
the
child
left
the
water
a
double
inversion
in
the
second
half
her
husband
left
her
in
the
dream
thoughts
she
left
her
husband
another
parturition
dream
is
related
by
abraham
of
a
young
woman
looking
forward
to
her
first
confinement
from
a
place
in
the
floor
of
the
house
a
subterranean
canal
leads
directly
into
the
water
parturition
path
amniotic
liquor
she
lifts
up
a
trap
in
the
floor
and
there
immediately
appears
a
creature
dressed
in
a
brownish
fur
which
almost
resembles
a
seal
this
creature
changes
into
the
younger
brother
of
the
dreamer
to
whom
she
has
always
stood
in
maternal
relationship
dreams
of
saving
are
connected
with
parturition
dreams
to
save
especially
to
save
from
the
water
is
equivalent
to
giving
birth
when
dreamed
by
a
woman
this
sense
is
however
modified
when
the
dreamer
is
a
man
robbers
burglars
at
night
and
ghosts
of
which
we
are
afraid
before
going
to
bed
and
which
occasionally
even
disturb
our
sleep
originate
in
one
and
the
same
childish
reminiscence
they
are
the
nightly
visitors
who
have
awakened
the
child
to
set
it
on
the
chamber
so
that
it
may
not
wet
the
bed
or
have
lifted
the
cover
in
order
to
see
clearly
how
the
child
is
holding
its
hands
while
sleeping
i
have
been
able
to
induce
an
exact
recollection
of
the
nocturnal
visitor
in
the
analysis
of
some
of
these
anxiety
dreams
the
robbers
were
always
the
father
the
ghosts
more
probably
corresponded
to
feminine
persons
with
white
when
one
has
become
familiar
with
the
abundant
use
of
symbolism
for
the
representation
of
sexual
material
in
dreams
one
naturally
raises
the
question
whether
there
are
not
many
of
these
symbols
which
appear
once
and
for
all
with
a
firmly
established
significance
like
the
signs
in
stenography
and
one
is
tempted
to
compile
a
new
according
to
the
cipher
method
in
this
connection
it
may
be
remarked
that
this
symbolism
does
not
belong
peculiarly
to
the
dream
but
rather
to
unconscious
thinking
particularly
that
of
the
masses
and
it
is
to
be
found
in
greater
perfection
in
the
folklore
in
the
myths
legends
and
manners
of
speech
in
the
proverbial
sayings
and
in
the
current
witticisms
of
a
nation
than
in
its
dreams
the
dream
takes
advantage
of
this
symbolism
in
order
to
give
a
disguised
representation
to
its
latent
thoughts
among
the
symbols
which
are
used
in
this
manner
there
are
of
course
many
which
regularly
or
almost
regularly
mean
the
same
thing
only
it
is
necessary
to
keep
in
mind
the
curious
plasticity
of
psychic
material
now
and
then
a
symbol
in
the
dream
content
may
have
to
be
interpreted
not
symbolically
but
according
to
its
real
meaning
at
another
time
the
dreamer
owing
to
a
peculiar
set
of
recollections
may
create
for
himself
the
right
to
use
anything
whatever
as
a
sexual
symbol
though
it
is
not
ordinarily
used
in
that
way
nor
are
the
most
frequently
used
sexual
symbols
unambiguous
every
time
after
these
limitations
and
reservations
i
may
call
attention
to
the
following
emperor
and
empress
king
and
queen
in
most
cases
really
represent
the
parents
of
the
dreamer
the
dreamer
himself
or
herself
is
the
prince
or
princess
all
elongated
objects
sticks
and
umbrellas
on
account
of
the
which
might
be
compared
to
an
erection
all
elongated
and
sharp
weapons
knives
daggers
and
pikes
are
intended
to
represent
the
male
member
a
frequent
not
very
intelligible
symbol
for
the
same
is
a
on
account
of
the
rubbing
and
scraping
little
cases
boxes
caskets
closets
and
stoves
correspond
to
the
female
part
the
symbolism
of
lock
and
key
has
been
very
gracefully
employed
by
uhland
in
his
song
about
the
grafen
eberstein
to
make
a
common
smutty
joke
the
dream
of
walking
through
a
row
of
rooms
is
a
brothel
or
harem
dream
staircases
ladders
and
flights
of
stairs
or
climbing
on
these
either
upwards
or
downwards
are
symbolic
representations
of
the
sexual
act
smooth
walls
over
which
one
is
climbing
façades
of
houses
upon
which
one
is
letting
oneself
down
frequently
under
great
anxiety
correspond
to
the
erect
human
body
and
probably
repeat
in
the
dream
reminiscences
of
the
upward
climbing
of
little
children
on
their
parents
or
foster
parents
smooth
walls
are
men
often
in
a
dream
of
anxiety
one
is
holding
on
firmly
to
some
projection
from
a
house
tables
set
tables
and
boards
are
women
perhaps
on
account
of
the
opposition
which
does
away
with
the
bodily
contours
since
bed
and
board
et
constitute
marriage
the
former
are
often
put
for
the
latter
in
the
dream
and
as
far
as
practicable
the
sexual
presentation
complex
is
transposed
to
the
eating
complex
of
articles
of
dress
the
woman
hat
may
frequently
be
definitely
interpreted
as
the
male
genital
in
dreams
of
men
one
often
finds
the
cravat
as
a
symbol
for
the
penis
this
indeed
is
not
only
because
cravats
hang
down
long
and
are
characteristic
of
the
man
but
also
because
one
can
select
them
at
pleasure
a
freedom
which
is
prohibited
by
nature
in
the
original
of
the
symbol
persons
who
make
use
of
this
symbol
in
the
dream
are
very
extravagant
with
cravats
and
possess
regular
collections
of
them
all
complicated
machines
and
apparatus
in
dream
are
very
probably
genitals
in
the
description
of
which
dream
symbolism
shows
itself
to
be
as
tireless
as
the
activity
of
wit
likewise
many
landscapes
in
dreams
especially
with
bridges
or
with
wooded
mountains
can
be
readily
recognized
as
descriptions
of
the
genitals
finally
where
one
finds
incomprehensible
neologisms
one
may
think
of
combinations
made
up
of
components
having
a
sexual
significance
children
also
in
the
dream
often
signify
the
genitals
as
men
and
women
are
in
the
habit
of
fondly
referring
to
their
genital
organ
as
their
little
one
as
a
very
recent
symbol
of
the
male
genital
may
be
mentioned
the
flying
machine
utilization
of
which
is
justified
by
its
relation
to
flying
as
well
as
occasionally
by
its
form
to
play
with
a
little
child
or
to
beat
a
little
one
is
often
the
representation
of
onanism
a
number
of
other
symbols
in
part
not
sufficiently
verified
are
given
by
stekel
who
illustrates
them
with
examples
right
and
left
according
to
him
are
to
be
conceived
in
the
dream
in
an
ethical
sense
the
right
way
always
signifies
the
road
to
righteousness
the
left
the
one
to
crime
thus
the
left
may
signify
homosexuality
incest
and
perversion
while
the
right
signifies
marriage
relations
with
a
prostitute
the
meaning
is
always
determined
by
the
individual
moral
of
the
dreamer
relatives
in
the
dream
generally
play
the
rôle
of
genitals
not
to
be
able
to
catch
up
with
a
wagon
is
interpreted
by
stekel
as
regret
not
to
be
able
to
come
up
to
a
difference
in
age
baggage
with
which
one
travels
is
the
burden
of
sin
by
which
one
is
oppressed
also
numbers
which
frequently
occur
in
the
dream
are
assigned
by
stekel
a
fixed
symbolical
meaning
but
these
interpretations
seem
neither
sufficiently
verified
nor
of
general
validity
although
the
interpretation
in
individual
cases
can
generally
be
recognized
as
probable
in
a
recently
published
book
by
stekel
sprache
des
which
i
was
unable
to
utilize
there
is
a
list
of
the
most
common
sexual
symbols
the
object
of
which
is
to
prove
that
all
sexual
symbols
can
be
bisexually
used
he
states
is
there
a
symbol
which
if
in
any
way
permitted
by
the
phantasy
may
not
be
used
simultaneously
in
the
masculine
and
the
feminine
sense
to
be
sure
the
clause
in
parentheses
takes
away
much
of
the
absoluteness
of
this
assertion
for
this
is
not
at
all
permitted
by
the
phantasy
i
do
not
however
think
it
superfluous
to
state
that
in
my
experience
stekel
general
statement
has
to
give
way
to
the
recognition
of
a
greater
manifoldness
besides
those
symbols
which
are
just
as
frequent
for
the
male
as
for
the
female
genitals
there
are
others
which
preponderately
or
almost
exclusively
designate
one
of
the
sexes
and
there
are
still
others
of
which
only
the
male
or
only
the
female
signification
is
known
to
use
long
firm
objects
and
weapons
as
symbols
of
the
female
genitals
or
hollow
objects
chests
pouches
as
symbols
of
the
male
genitals
is
indeed
not
allowed
by
the
fancy
it
is
true
that
the
tendency
of
the
dream
and
the
unconscious
fancy
to
utilize
the
sexual
symbol
bisexually
betrays
an
archaic
trend
for
in
childhood
a
difference
in
the
genitals
is
unknown
and
the
same
genitals
are
attributed
to
both
sexes
these
very
incomplete
suggestions
may
suffice
to
stimulate
others
to
make
a
more
careful
collection
i
shall
now
add
a
few
examples
of
the
application
of
such
symbolisms
in
dreams
which
will
serve
to
show
how
impossible
it
becomes
to
interpret
a
dream
without
taking
into
account
the
symbolism
of
dreams
and
how
imperatively
it
obtrudes
itself
in
many
cases
the
hat
as
a
symbol
of
the
man
of
the
male
genital
a
fragment
from
the
dream
of
a
young
woman
who
suffered
from
agoraphobia
on
account
of
a
fear
of
temptation
i
am
walking
in
the
street
in
summer
i
wear
a
straw
hat
of
peculiar
shape
the
middle
piece
of
which
is
bent
upwards
and
the
side
pieces
of
which
hang
downwards
the
description
became
here
obstructed
and
in
such
a
fashion
that
one
is
lower
than
the
other
i
am
cheerful
and
in
a
confidential
mood
and
as
i
pass
a
troop
of
young
officers
i
think
to
myself
none
of
you
can
have
any
designs
upon
me
as
she
could
produce
no
associations
to
the
hat
i
said
to
her
the
hat
is
really
a
male
genital
with
its
raised
middle
piece
and
the
two
downward
hanging
side
pieces
i
intentionally
refrained
from
interpreting
those
details
concerning
the
unequal
downward
hanging
of
the
two
side
pieces
although
just
such
individualities
in
the
determinations
lead
the
way
to
the
interpretation
i
continued
by
saying
that
if
she
only
had
a
man
with
such
a
virile
genital
she
would
not
have
to
fear
the
officers
that
is
she
would
have
nothing
to
wish
from
them
for
she
is
mainly
kept
from
going
without
protection
and
company
by
her
fancies
of
temptation
this
last
explanation
of
her
fear
i
had
already
been
able
to
give
her
repeatedly
on
the
basis
of
other
material
it
is
quite
remarkable
how
the
dreamer
behaved
after
this
interpretation
she
withdrew
her
description
of
the
hat
and
claimed
not
to
have
said
that
the
two
side
pieces
were
hanging
downwards
i
was
however
too
sure
of
what
i
had
heard
to
allow
myself
to
be
misled
and
i
persisted
in
it
she
was
quiet
for
a
while
and
then
found
the
courage
to
ask
why
it
was
that
one
of
her
husband
testicles
was
lower
than
the
other
and
whether
it
was
the
same
in
all
men
with
this
the
peculiar
detail
of
the
hat
was
explained
and
the
whole
interpretation
was
accepted
by
her
the
hat
symbol
was
familiar
to
me
long
before
the
patient
related
this
dream
from
other
but
less
transparent
cases
i
believe
that
the
hat
may
also
be
taken
as
a
female
genital
the
little
one
as
the
genital
to
be
run
over
as
a
symbol
of
sexual
intercourse
another
dream
of
the
same
agoraphobic
patient
her
mother
sends
away
her
little
daughter
so
that
she
must
go
alone
she
rides
with
her
mother
to
the
railroad
and
sees
her
little
one
walking
directly
upon
the
tracks
so
that
she
can
not
avoid
being
run
over
she
hears
the
bones
crackle
from
this
she
experiences
a
feeling
of
discomfort
but
no
real
horror
she
then
looks
out
through
the
car
window
to
see
whether
the
parts
can
not
be
seen
behind
she
then
reproaches
her
mother
for
allowing
the
little
one
to
go
out
alone
analysis
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
to
give
here
a
complete
interpretation
of
the
dream
it
forms
part
of
a
cycle
of
dreams
and
can
be
fully
understood
only
in
connection
with
the
others
for
it
is
not
easy
to
get
the
necessary
material
sufficiently
isolated
to
prove
the
symbolism
the
patient
at
first
finds
that
the
railroad
journey
is
to
be
interpreted
historically
as
an
allusion
to
a
departure
from
a
sanatorium
for
nervous
diseases
with
the
superintendent
of
which
she
naturally
was
in
love
her
mother
took
her
away
from
this
place
and
the
physician
came
to
the
railroad
station
and
handed
her
a
bouquet
of
flowers
on
leaving
she
felt
uncomfortable
because
her
mother
witnessed
this
homage
here
the
mother
therefore
appears
as
a
disturber
of
her
love
affairs
which
is
the
rôle
actually
played
by
this
strict
woman
during
her
daughter
girlhood
the
next
thought
referred
to
the
sentence
she
then
looks
to
see
whether
the
parts
can
be
seen
behind
in
the
dream
façade
one
would
naturally
be
compelled
to
think
of
the
parts
of
the
little
daughter
run
over
and
ground
up
the
thought
however
turns
in
quite
a
different
direction
she
recalls
that
she
once
saw
her
father
in
the
naked
from
behind
she
then
begins
to
talk
about
the
sex
differentiation
and
asserts
that
in
the
man
the
genitals
can
be
seen
from
behind
but
in
the
woman
they
can
not
in
this
connection
she
now
herself
offers
the
interpretation
that
the
little
one
is
the
genital
her
little
one
she
has
a
daughter
her
own
genital
she
reproaches
her
mother
for
wanting
her
to
live
as
though
she
had
no
genital
and
recognizes
this
reproach
in
the
introductory
sentence
of
the
dream
the
mother
sends
away
her
little
one
so
that
she
must
go
alone
in
her
phantasy
going
alone
on
the
street
signifies
to
have
no
man
and
no
sexual
relations
coire
to
go
together
and
this
she
does
not
like
according
to
all
her
statements
she
really
suffered
as
a
girl
on
account
of
the
jealousy
of
her
mother
because
she
showed
a
preference
for
her
father
the
little
one
has
been
noted
as
a
symbol
for
the
male
or
the
female
genitals
by
stekel
who
can
refer
in
this
connection
to
a
very
widespread
usage
of
language
the
deeper
interpretation
of
this
dream
depends
upon
another
dream
of
the
same
night
in
which
the
dreamer
identifies
herself
with
her
brother
she
was
a
tomboy
and
was
always
being
told
that
she
should
have
been
born
a
boy
this
identification
with
the
brother
shows
with
special
clearness
that
the
little
one
signifies
the
genital
the
mother
threatened
him
her
with
castration
which
could
only
be
understood
as
a
punishment
for
playing
with
the
parts
and
the
identification
therefore
shows
that
she
herself
had
masturbated
as
a
child
though
this
fact
she
now
retained
only
in
memory
concerning
her
brother
an
early
knowledge
of
the
male
genital
which
she
later
lost
she
must
have
acquired
at
that
time
according
to
the
assertions
of
this
second
dream
moreover
the
second
dream
points
to
the
infantile
sexual
theory
that
girls
originate
from
boys
through
castration
after
i
had
told
her
of
this
childish
belief
she
at
once
confirmed
it
with
an
anecdote
in
which
the
boy
asks
the
girl
was
it
cut
off
to
which
the
girl
replied
no
it
always
been
so
the
sending
away
of
the
little
one
of
the
genital
in
the
first
dream
therefore
also
refers
to
the
threatened
castration
finally
she
blames
her
mother
for
not
having
been
born
a
boy
that
being
run
over
symbolizes
sexual
intercourse
would
not
be
evident
from
this
dream
if
we
were
not
sure
of
it
from
many
other
sources
representation
of
the
genital
by
structures
stairways
and
shafts
dream
of
a
young
man
inhibited
by
a
father
complex
he
is
taking
a
walk
with
his
father
in
a
place
which
is
surely
the
prater
for
the
may
be
seen
in
front
of
which
there
is
a
small
front
structure
to
which
is
attached
a
captive
balloon
the
balloon
however
seems
quite
collapsed
his
father
asks
him
what
this
is
all
for
he
is
surprised
at
it
but
he
explains
it
to
his
father
they
come
into
a
court
in
which
lies
a
large
sheet
of
tin
his
father
wants
to
pull
off
a
big
piece
of
this
but
first
looks
around
to
see
if
any
one
is
watching
he
tells
his
father
that
all
he
needs
to
do
is
to
speak
to
the
watchman
and
then
he
can
take
without
any
further
difficulty
as
much
as
he
wants
to
from
this
court
a
stairway
leads
down
into
a
shaft
the
walls
of
which
are
softly
upholstered
something
like
a
leather
pocketbook
at
the
end
of
this
shaft
there
is
a
longer
platform
and
then
a
new
shaft
begins
analysis
this
dream
belongs
to
a
type
of
patient
which
is
not
favorable
from
a
therapeutic
point
of
view
they
follow
in
the
analysis
without
offering
any
resistances
whatever
up
to
a
certain
point
but
from
that
point
on
they
remain
almost
inaccessible
this
dream
he
almost
analyzed
himself
the
rotunda
he
said
is
my
genital
the
captive
balloon
in
front
is
my
penis
about
the
weakness
of
which
i
have
worried
we
must
however
interpret
in
greater
detail
the
rotunda
is
the
buttock
which
is
regularly
associated
by
the
child
with
the
genital
the
smaller
front
structure
is
the
scrotum
in
the
dream
his
father
asks
him
what
this
is
all
for
that
is
he
asks
him
about
the
purpose
and
arrangement
of
the
genitals
it
is
quite
evident
that
this
state
of
affairs
should
be
turned
around
and
that
he
should
be
the
questioner
as
such
a
questioning
on
the
side
of
the
father
has
never
taken
place
in
reality
we
must
conceive
the
dream
thought
as
a
wish
or
take
it
conditionally
as
follows
if
i
had
only
asked
my
father
for
sexual
enlightenment
the
continuation
of
this
thought
we
shall
soon
find
in
another
place
the
court
in
which
the
tin
sheet
is
spread
out
is
not
to
be
conceived
symbolically
in
the
first
instance
but
originates
from
his
place
of
business
for
discretionary
reasons
i
have
inserted
the
tin
for
another
material
in
which
the
father
deals
without
however
changing
anything
in
the
verbal
expression
of
the
dream
the
dreamer
had
entered
his
father
business
and
had
taken
a
terrible
dislike
to
the
questionable
practices
upon
which
profit
mainly
depends
hence
the
continuation
of
the
above
dream
thought
if
i
had
only
asked
him
would
be
he
would
have
deceived
me
just
as
he
does
his
customers
for
the
pulling
off
which
serves
to
represent
commercial
dishonesty
the
dreamer
himself
gives
a
second
explanation
namely
onanism
this
is
not
only
entirely
familiar
to
us
but
agrees
very
well
with
the
fact
that
the
secrecy
of
onanism
is
expressed
by
its
opposite
why
one
can
do
it
quite
openly
it
moreover
agrees
entirely
with
our
expectations
that
the
onanistic
activity
is
again
put
off
on
the
father
just
as
was
the
questioning
in
the
first
scene
of
the
dream
the
shaft
he
at
once
interprets
as
the
vagina
by
referring
to
the
soft
upholstering
of
the
walls
that
the
act
of
coition
in
the
vagina
is
described
as
a
going
down
instead
of
in
the
usual
way
as
a
going
up
i
have
also
found
true
in
other
instances
the
details
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
shaft
there
is
a
longer
platform
and
then
a
new
shaft
he
himself
explains
biographically
he
had
for
some
time
consorted
with
women
sexually
but
had
then
given
it
up
because
of
inhibitions
and
now
hopes
to
be
able
to
take
it
up
again
with
the
aid
of
the
treatment
the
dream
however
becomes
indistinct
toward
the
end
and
to
the
experienced
interpreter
it
becomes
evident
that
in
the
second
scene
of
the
dream
the
influence
of
another
subject
has
begun
to
assert
itself
in
this
his
father
business
and
his
dishonest
practices
signify
the
first
vagina
represented
as
a
shaft
so
that
one
might
think
of
a
reference
to
the
mother
the
male
genital
symbolized
by
persons
and
the
female
by
a
landscape
dream
of
a
woman
of
the
lower
class
whose
husband
is
a
policeman
reported
by
b
dattner
then
some
one
broke
into
the
house
and
anxiously
called
for
a
policeman
but
he
went
with
two
tramps
by
mutual
consent
into
a
church
to
which
led
a
great
many
stairs
behind
the
church
there
was
a
mountain
on
top
of
which
a
dense
forest
the
policeman
was
furnished
with
a
helmet
a
gorget
and
a
cloak
the
two
vagrants
who
went
along
with
the
policeman
quite
peaceably
had
tied
to
their
loins
aprons
a
road
led
from
the
church
to
the
mountain
this
road
was
overgrown
on
each
side
with
grass
and
brushwood
which
became
thicker
and
thicker
as
it
reached
the
height
of
the
mountain
where
it
spread
out
into
quite
a
forest
a
stairway
dream
reported
and
interpreted
by
otto
rank
for
the
following
transparent
pollution
dream
i
am
indebted
to
the
same
colleague
who
furnished
us
with
the
dream
i
am
running
down
the
stairway
in
the
after
a
little
girl
whom
i
wish
to
punish
because
she
has
done
something
to
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
some
one
held
the
child
for
me
a
woman
i
grasp
it
but
do
not
know
whether
i
have
hit
it
for
i
suddenly
find
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
stairway
where
i
practice
coitus
with
the
child
in
the
air
as
it
were
it
is
really
no
coitus
i
only
rub
my
genital
on
her
external
genital
and
in
doing
this
i
see
it
very
distinctly
as
distinctly
as
i
see
her
head
which
is
lying
sideways
during
the
sexual
act
i
see
hanging
to
the
left
and
above
me
also
as
if
in
the
air
two
small
pictures
landscapes
representing
a
house
on
a
green
on
the
smaller
one
my
surname
stood
in
the
place
where
the
painter
signature
should
be
it
seemed
to
be
intended
for
my
birthday
present
a
small
sign
hung
in
front
of
the
pictures
to
the
effect
that
cheaper
pictures
could
also
be
obtained
i
then
see
myself
very
indistinctly
lying
in
bed
just
as
i
had
seen
myself
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
i
am
awakened
by
a
feeling
of
dampness
which
came
from
the
pollution
interpretation
the
dreamer
had
been
in
a
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
the
dream
where
while
he
was
waiting
he
examined
some
pictures
which
were
exhibited
which
represented
motives
similar
to
the
dream
pictures
he
stepped
nearer
to
a
small
picture
which
particularly
took
his
fancy
in
order
to
see
the
name
of
the
artist
which
however
was
quite
unknown
to
him
later
in
the
same
evening
in
company
he
heard
about
a
bohemian
who
boasted
that
her
illegitimate
child
was
made
on
the
stairs
the
dreamer
inquired
about
the
details
of
this
unusual
occurrence
and
learned
that
the
went
with
her
lover
to
the
home
of
her
parents
where
there
was
no
opportunity
for
sexual
relations
and
that
the
excited
man
performed
the
act
on
the
stairs
in
witty
allusion
to
the
mischievous
expression
used
about
the
dreamer
remarked
the
child
really
grew
on
the
cellar
steps
these
experiences
of
the
day
which
are
quite
prominent
in
the
dream
content
were
readily
reproduced
by
the
dreamer
but
he
just
as
readily
reproduced
an
old
fragment
of
infantile
recollection
which
was
also
utilized
by
the
dream
the
was
the
house
in
which
he
had
spent
the
greatest
part
of
his
childhood
and
in
which
he
had
first
become
acquainted
with
sexual
problems
in
this
house
he
used
among
other
things
to
slide
down
the
banister
astride
which
caused
him
to
become
sexually
excited
in
the
dream
he
also
comes
down
the
stairs
very
rapidly
so
rapidly
that
according
to
his
own
distinct
assertions
he
hardly
touched
the
individual
stairs
but
rather
flew
or
slid
down
as
we
used
to
say
upon
reference
to
this
infantile
experience
the
beginning
of
the
dream
seems
to
represent
the
factor
of
sexual
excitement
in
the
same
house
and
in
the
adjacent
residence
the
dreamer
used
to
play
pugnacious
games
with
the
neighboring
children
in
which
he
satisfied
himself
just
as
he
did
in
the
dream
if
one
recalls
from
freud
investigation
of
sexual
symbolism
that
in
the
dream
stairs
or
climbing
stairs
almost
regularly
symbolizes
coitus
the
dream
becomes
clear
its
motive
power
as
well
as
its
effect
as
is
shown
by
the
pollution
is
of
a
purely
libidinous
nature
sexual
excitement
became
aroused
during
the
sleeping
state
in
the
dream
this
is
represented
by
the
rapid
running
or
sliding
down
the
stairs
and
the
sadistic
thread
in
this
is
on
the
basis
of
the
pugnacious
playing
indicated
in
the
pursuing
and
overcoming
of
the
child
the
libidinous
excitement
becomes
enhanced
and
urges
to
sexual
action
represented
in
the
dream
by
the
grasping
of
the
child
and
the
conveyance
of
it
to
the
middle
of
the
stairway
up
to
this
point
the
dream
would
be
one
of
pure
sexual
symbolism
and
obscure
for
the
unpracticed
dream
interpreter
but
this
symbolic
gratification
which
would
have
insured
undisturbed
sleep
was
not
sufficient
for
the
powerful
libidinous
excitement
the
excitement
leads
to
an
orgasm
and
thus
the
whole
stairway
symbolism
is
unmasked
as
a
substitute
for
coitus
freud
lays
stress
on
the
rhythmical
character
of
both
actions
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
sexual
utilization
of
the
stairway
symbolism
and
this
dream
especially
seems
to
corroborate
this
for
according
to
the
express
assertion
of
the
dreamer
the
rhythm
of
a
sexual
act
was
the
most
pronounced
feature
in
the
whole
dream
still
another
remark
concerning
the
two
pictures
which
aside
from
their
real
significance
also
have
the
value
of
weibsbilder
literally
but
idiomatically
this
is
at
once
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
dream
deals
with
a
big
and
a
little
picture
just
as
the
dream
content
presents
a
big
grown
up
and
a
little
girl
that
cheap
pictures
could
also
be
obtained
points
to
the
prostitution
complex
just
as
the
dreamer
surname
on
the
little
picture
and
the
thought
that
it
was
intended
for
his
birthday
point
to
the
parent
complex
to
be
born
on
the
stairway
to
be
conceived
in
coitus
the
indistinct
final
scene
in
which
the
dreamer
sees
himself
on
the
staircase
landing
lying
in
bed
and
feeling
wet
seems
to
go
back
into
childhood
even
beyond
the
infantile
onanism
and
manifestly
has
its
prototype
in
similarly
pleasurable
scenes
of
a
modified
to
one
of
my
very
nervous
patients
who
was
an
abstainer
whose
fancy
was
fixed
on
his
mother
and
who
repeatedly
dreamed
of
climbing
stairs
accompanied
by
his
mother
i
once
remarked
that
moderate
masturbation
would
be
less
harmful
to
him
than
enforced
abstinence
this
influence
provoked
the
following
dream
his
piano
teacher
reproaches
him
for
neglecting
his
and
for
not
practicing
the
of
moscheles
and
clementi
ad
in
relation
to
this
he
remarked
that
the
is
only
a
stairway
and
that
the
piano
itself
is
only
a
stairway
as
it
has
a
scale
it
is
correct
to
say
that
there
is
no
series
of
associations
which
can
not
be
adapted
to
the
representation
of
sexual
facts
i
conclude
with
the
dream
of
a
chemist
a
young
man
who
has
been
trying
to
give
up
his
habit
of
masturbation
by
replacing
it
with
intercourse
with
women
on
the
day
before
the
dream
he
had
given
a
student
instruction
concerning
grignard
reaction
in
which
magnesium
is
to
be
dissolved
in
absolutely
pure
ether
under
the
catalytic
influence
of
iodine
two
days
before
there
had
been
an
explosion
in
the
course
of
the
same
reaction
in
which
the
investigator
had
burned
his
hand
dream
i
is
to
make
he
sees
the
apparatus
with
particular
clearness
but
he
has
substituted
himself
for
the
magnesium
he
is
now
in
a
curious
swaying
attitude
he
keeps
repeating
to
himself
this
is
the
right
thing
it
is
working
my
feet
are
beginning
to
dissolve
and
my
knees
are
getting
soft
then
he
reaches
down
and
feels
for
his
feet
and
meanwhile
he
does
not
know
how
he
takes
his
legs
out
of
the
crucible
and
then
again
he
says
to
himself
that
can
not
be
yes
it
must
be
so
it
has
been
done
correctly
then
he
partially
awakens
and
repeats
the
dream
to
himself
because
he
wants
to
tell
it
to
me
he
is
distinctly
afraid
of
the
analysis
of
the
dream
he
is
much
excited
during
this
state
and
repeats
continually

his

lady
but
he
does
not

up
until

he
says
to
himself

too

when
you
get

it

he
feels
sure
that
even
the
first
dream
contains
a
reference
to
the
lady
whom
he
is
to

at
the
rendezvous
the
dream
was
dreamed
during
the
night
before
the
expected
meeting
the
student
to
whom
he
gave
the
instruction
is
a
particularly
unpleasant
fellow
he
had
said
to
the
chemist
that
is
right
because
the
magnesium
was
still
unaffected
and
the
latter
answered
as
though
he
did
not
care
anything
about
it
it
certainly
is
right
he
himself
must
be
this
student
he
is
as
indifferent
towards
his
analysis
as
the
student
is
towards
his
synthesis
the
in
the
dream
however
who
accomplishes
the
operation
is
myself
how
unpleasant
he
must
seem
to
me
with
his
indifference
towards
the
success
achieved
moreover
he
is
the
material
with
which
the
analysis
synthesis
is
made

question

success
of
the
treatment
the
legs
in
the
dream
recall
an
impression
of
the
previous
evening
he
met
a
lady
at
a
dancing
lesson
whom
he
wished
to
conquer
he
pressed
her
to
him
so
closely
that
she
once
cried
out
after
he
had
stopped
pressing
against
her
legs
he
felt
her
firm
responding
pressure
against
his
lower
thighs
as
far
as
just
above
his
knees
at
the
place
mentioned
in
the
dream
in
this
situation
then
the
woman
is

magnesium
in
the
retort
which
is
at
last
working
he
is
feminine
towards
me
as
he
is
masculine
towards
the
woman
if
it
will
work
with
the
woman
the
treatment
will
also
work
feeling
and
becoming
aware
of
himself
in
the
region
of
his
knees
refers
to
masturbation
and
corresponds
to
his
fatigue
of
the
previous
day
the
rendezvous
had
actually
been
set
for
eleven
his
wish
to
oversleep
and
to
remain
with
his
usual
sexual
objects
that
is
with
masturbation
corresponds
with
his
resistance
it
is
only
of
late
that
i
have
learned
to
value
the
significance
of
fancies
and
unconscious
thoughts
about
life
in
the
womb
they
contain
the
explanation
of
the
curious
fear
felt
by
so
many
people
of
being
buried
alive
as
well
as
the
profoundest
unconscious
reason
for
the
belief
in
a
life
after
death
which
represents
nothing
but
a
projection
into
the
future
of
this
mysterious
life
before
birth
act
of
birth
moreover
is
the
first
experience
with
fear
and
is

and

the
wish
in
dreams
that
the
dream
should
be
nothing
but
a
surely
seemed
strange
to
us
all
and
that
not
alone
because
of
the
contradictions
offered
by
the
anxiety
dream
after
learning
from
the
first
analytical
explanations
that
the
dream
conceals
sense
and
psychic
validity
we
could
hardly
expect
so
simple
a
determination
of
this
sense
according
to
the
correct
but
concise
definition
of
aristotle
the
dream
is
a
continuation
of
thinking
in
sleep
in
so
far
as
one
sleeps
considering
that
during
the
day
our
thoughts
produce
such
a
diversity
of
psychic
acts
judgments
conclusions
contradictions
expectations
intentions
why
should
our
sleeping
thoughts
be
forced
to
confine
themselves
to
the
production
of
wishes
are
there
not
on
the
contrary
many
dreams
that
present
a
different
psychic
act
in
dream
form
a
solicitude
and
is
not
the
very
transparent
father
dream
mentioned
above
of
just
such
a
nature
from
the
gleam
of
light
falling
into
his
eyes
while
asleep
the
father
draws
the
solicitous
conclusion
that
a
candle
has
been
upset
and
may
have
set
fire
to
the
corpse
he
transforms
this
conclusion
into
a
dream
by
investing
it
with
a
senseful
situation
enacted
in
the
present
tense
what
part
is
played
in
this
dream
by
the
and
which
are
we
to
suspect
the
predominance
of
the
thought
continued
from
the
waking
state
or
of
the
thought
incited
by
the
new
sensory
impression
all
these
considerations
are
just
and
force
us
to
enter
more
deeply
into
the
part
played
by
the
in
the
dream
and
into
the
significance
of
the
waking
thoughts
continued
in
sleep
it
is
in
fact
the
that
has
already
induced
us
to
separate
dreams
into
two
groups
we
have
found
some
dreams
that
were
plainly
and
others
in
which
could
not
be
recognized
and
was
frequently
concealed
by
every
available
means
in
this
latter
class
of
dreams
we
recognized
the
influence
of
the
dream
censor
the
undisguised
wish
dreams
were
chiefly
found
in
children
yet
fleeting
wish
dreams
i
purposely
emphasize
this
word
to
occur
also
in
adults
we
may
now
ask
whence
the
wish
fulfilled
in
the
dream
originates
but
to
what
opposition
or
to
what
diversity
do
we
refer
this
whence
i
think
it
is
to
the
opposition
between
conscious
daily
life
and
a
psychic
activity
remaining
unconscious
which
can
only
make
itself
noticeable
during
the
night
i
thus
find
a
threefold
possibility
for
the
origin
of
a
wish
firstly
it
may
have
been
incited
during
the
day
and
owing
to
external
circumstances
failed
to
find
gratification
there
is
thus
left
for
the
night
an
acknowledged
but
unfulfilled
wish
secondly
it
may
come
to
the
surface
during
the
day
but
be
rejected
leaving
an
unfulfilled
but
suppressed
wish
or
thirdly
it
may
have
no
relation
to
daily
life
and
belong
to
those
wishes
that
originate
during
the
night
from
the
suppression
if
we
now
follow
our
scheme
of
the
psychic
apparatus
we
can
localize
a
wish
of
the
first
order
in
the
system
forec
we
may
assume
that
a
wish
of
the
second
order
has
been
forced
back
from
the
forec
system
into
the
unc
system
where
alone
if
anywhere
it
can
maintain
itself
while
a
of
the
third
order
we
consider
altogether
incapable
of
leaving
the
unc
system
this
brings
up
the
question
whether
wishes
arising
from
these
different
sources
possess
the
same
value
for
the
dream
and
whether
they
have
the
same
power
to
incite
a
dream
on
reviewing
the
dreams
which
we
have
at
our
disposal
for
answering
this
question
we
are
at
once
moved
to
add
as
a
fourth
source
of
the
the
actual
wish
incitements
arising
during
the
night
such
as
thirst
and
sexual
desire
it
then
becomes
evident
that
the
source
of
the
does
not
affect
its
capacity
to
incite
a
dream
that
a
wish
suppressed
during
the
day
asserts
itself
in
the
dream
can
be
shown
by
a
great
many
examples
i
shall
mention
a
very
simple
example
of
this
class
a
somewhat
sarcastic
young
lady
whose
younger
friend
has
become
engaged
to
be
married
is
asked
throughout
the
day
by
her
acquaintances
whether
she
knows
and
what
she
thinks
of
the
fiancé
she
answers
with
unqualified
praise
thereby
silencing
her
own
judgment
as
she
would
prefer
to
tell
the
truth
namely
that
he
is
an
ordinary
person
the
following
night
she
dreams
that
the
same
question
is
put
to
her
and
that
she
replies
with
the
formula
in
case
of
subsequent
orders
it
will
suffice
to
mention
the
number
finally
we
have
learned
from
numerous
analyses
that
the
wish
in
all
dreams
that
have
been
subject
to
distortion
has
been
derived
from
the
unconscious
and
has
been
unable
to
come
to
perception
in
the
waking
state
thus
it
would
appear
that
all
wishes
are
of
the
same
value
and
force
for
the
dream
formation
i
am
at
present
unable
to
prove
that
the
state
of
affairs
is
really
different
but
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
assume
a
more
stringent
determination
of
the
children
dreams
leave
no
doubt
that
an
unfulfilled
wish
of
the
day
may
be
the
instigator
of
the
dream
but
we
must
not
forget
that
it
is
after
all
the
wish
of
a
child
that
it
is
a
of
infantile
strength
only
i
have
a
strong
doubt
whether
an
unfulfilled
wish
from
the
day
would
suffice
to
create
a
dream
in
an
adult
it
would
rather
seem
that
as
we
learn
to
control
our
impulses
by
intellectual
activity
we
more
and
more
reject
as
vain
the
formation
or
retention
of
such
intense
wishes
as
are
natural
to
childhood
in
this
indeed
there
may
be
individual
variations
some
retain
the
infantile
type
of
psychic
processes
longer
than
others
the
differences
are
here
the
same
as
those
found
in
the
gradual
decline
of
the
originally
distinct
visual
imagination
in
general
however
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
unfulfilled
wishes
of
the
day
are
insufficient
to
produce
a
dream
in
adults
i
readily
admit
that
the
wish
instigators
originating
in
conscious
like
contribute
towards
the
incitement
of
dreams
but
that
is
probably
all
the
dream
would
not
originate
if
the
foreconscious
wish
were
not
reinforced
from
another
source
that
source
is
the
unconscious
i
believe
that
conscious
wish
is
a
dream
inciter
only
if
it
succeeds
in
arousing
a
similar
unconscious
wish
which
reinforces
following
the
suggestions
obtained
through
the
psychoanalysis
of
the
neuroses
i
believe
that
these
unconscious
wishes
are
always
active
and
ready
for
expression
whenever
they
find
an
opportunity
to
unite
themselves
with
an
emotion
from
conscious
life
and
that
they
transfer
their
greater
intensity
to
the
lesser
intensity
of
the
latter
it
may
therefore
seem
that
the
conscious
wish
alone
has
been
realized
in
a
dream
but
a
slight
peculiarity
in
the
formation
of
this
dream
will
put
us
on
the
track
of
the
powerful
helper
from
the
unconscious
these
ever
active
and
as
it
were
immortal
wishes
from
the
unconscious
recall
the
legendary
titans
who
from
time
immemorial
have
borne
the
ponderous
mountains
which
were
once
rolled
upon
them
by
the
victorious
gods
and
which
even
now
quiver
from
time
to
time
from
the
convulsions
of
their
mighty
limbs
i
say
that
these
wishes
found
in
the
repression
are
of
themselves
of
an
infantile
origin
as
we
have
learned
from
the
psychological
investigation
of
the
neuroses
i
should
like
therefore
to
withdraw
the
opinion
previously
expressed
that
it
is
unimportant
whence
the
originates
and
replace
it
by
another
as
follows
wish
manifested
in
the
dream
must
be
an
infantile
in
the
adult
it
originates
in
the
while
in
the
child
where
no
separation
and
censor
as
yet
exist
between
forec
and
or
where
these
are
only
in
the
process
of
formation
it
is
an
unfulfilled
and
unrepressed
wish
from
the
waking
state
i
am
aware
that
this
conception
can
not
be
generally
demonstrated
but
i
maintain
nevertheless
that
it
can
be
frequently
demonstrated
even
when
it
was
not
suspected
and
that
it
can
not
be
generally
refuted
the
which
remain
from
the
conscious
waking
state
are
therefore
relegated
to
the
background
in
the
dream
formation
in
the
dream
content
i
shall
attribute
to
them
only
the
part
attributed
to
the
material
of
actual
sensations
during
sleep
if
i
now
take
into
account
those
other
psychic
instigations
remaining
from
the
waking
state
which
are
not
wishes
i
shall
only
adhere
to
the
line
mapped
out
for
me
by
this
train
of
thought
we
may
succeed
in
provisionally
terminating
the
sum
of
energy
of
our
waking
thoughts
by
deciding
to
go
to
sleep
he
is
a
good
sleeper
who
can
do
this
napoleon
is
reputed
to
have
been
a
model
of
this
sort
but
we
do
not
always
succeed
in
accomplishing
it
or
in
accomplishing
it
perfectly
unsolved
problems
harassing
cares
overwhelming
impressions
continue
the
thinking
activity
even
during
sleep
maintaining
psychic
processes
in
the
system
which
we
have
termed
the
foreconscious
these
mental
processes
continuing
into
sleep
may
be
divided
into
the
following
groups
that
which
has
not
been
terminated
during
the
day
owing
to
casual
prevention
that
which
has
been
left
unfinished
by
temporary
paralysis
of
our
mental
power
the
unsolved
that
which
has
been
rejected
and
suppressed
during
the
day
this
unites
with
a
powerful
group
formed
by
that
which
has
been
excited
in
our
unc
during
the
day
by
the
work
of
the
foreconscious
finally
we
may
add
group
consisting
of
the
indifferent
and
hence
unsettled
impressions
of
the
day
we
should
not
underrate
the
psychic
intensities
introduced
into
sleep
by
these
remnants
of
waking
life
especially
those
emanating
from
the
group
of
the
unsolved
these
excitations
surely
continue
to
strive
for
expression
during
the
night
and
we
may
assume
with
equal
certainty
that
the
sleeping
state
renders
impossible
the
usual
continuation
of
the
excitement
in
the
foreconscious
and
the
termination
of
the
excitement
by
its
becoming
conscious
as
far
as
we
can
normally
become
conscious
of
our
mental
processes
even
during
the
night
in
so
far
we
are
not
asleep
i
shall
not
venture
to
state
what
change
is
produced
in
the
forec
system
by
the
sleeping
state
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
psychological
character
of
sleep
is
essentially
due
to
the
change
of
energy
in
this
very
system
which
also
dominates
the
approach
to
motility
which
is
paralyzed
during
sleep
in
contradistinction
to
this
there
seems
to
be
nothing
in
the
psychology
of
the
dream
to
warrant
the
assumption
that
sleep
produces
any
but
secondary
changes
in
the
conditions
of
the
unc
system
hence
for
the
nocturnal
excitation
in
the
force
there
remains
no
other
path
than
that
followed
by
the
wish
excitements
from
the
unc
this
excitation
must
seek
reinforcement
from
the
and
follow
the
detours
of
the
unconscious
excitations
but
what
is
the
relation
of
the
foreconscious
day
remnants
to
the
dream
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
penetrate
abundantly
into
the
dream
that
they
utilize
the
dream
content
to
obtrude
themselves
upon
consciousness
even
during
the
night
indeed
they
occasionally
even
dominate
the
dream
content
and
impel
it
to
continue
the
work
of
the
day
it
is
also
certain
that
the
day
remnants
may
just
as
well
have
any
other
character
as
that
of
wishes
but
it
is
highly
instructive
and
even
decisive
for
the
theory
of
to
see
what
conditions
they
must
comply
with
in
order
to
be
received
into
the
dream
let
us
pick
out
one
of
the
dreams
cited
above
as
examples
the
dream
in
which
my
friend
otto
seems
to
show
the
symptoms
of
disease
my
friend
otto
appearance
occasioned
me
some
concern
during
the
day
and
this
worry
like
everything
else
referring
to
this
person
affected
me
i
may
also
assume
that
these
feelings
followed
me
into
sleep
i
was
probably
bent
on
finding
out
what
was
the
matter
with
him
in
the
night
my
worry
found
expression
in
the
dream
which
i
have
reported
the
content
of
which
was
not
only
senseless
but
failed
to
show
any
but
i
began
to
investigate
for
the
source
of
this
incongruous
expression
of
the
solicitude
felt
during
the
day
and
analysis
revealed
the
connection
i
identified
my
friend
otto
with
a
certain
baron
and
myself
with
a
professor
there
was
only
one
explanation
for
my
being
impelled
to
select
just
this
substitution
for
the
day
thought
i
must
have
always
been
prepared
in
the
unc
to
identify
myself
with
professor
as
it
meant
the
realization
of
one
of
the
immortal
infantile
wishes
viz
that
of
becoming
great
repulsive
ideas
respecting
my
friend
that
would
certainly
have
been
repudiated
in
a
waking
state
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
creep
into
the
dream
but
the
worry
of
the
day
likewise
found
some
form
of
expression
through
a
substitution
in
the
dream
content
the
day
thought
which
was
no
wish
in
itself
but
rather
a
worry
had
in
some
way
to
find
a
connection
with
the
infantile
now
unconscious
and
suppressed
wish
which
then
allowed
it
though
already
properly
prepared
to
originate
for
consciousness
the
more
dominating
this
worry
the
stronger
must
be
the
connection
to
be
established
between
the
contents
of
the
wish
and
that
of
the
worry
there
need
be
no
connection
nor
was
there
one
in
any
of
our
examples
we
can
now
sharply
define
the
significance
of
the
unconscious
wish
for
the
dream
it
may
be
admitted
that
there
is
a
whole
class
of
dreams
in
which
the
incitement
originates
preponderatingly
or
even
exclusively
from
the
remnants
of
daily
life
and
i
believe
that
even
my
cherished
desire
to
become
at
some
future
time
a
professor
extraordinarius
would
have
allowed
me
to
slumber
undisturbed
that
night
had
not
my
worry
about
my
friend
health
been
still
active
but
this
worry
alone
would
not
have
produced
a
dream
the
motive
power
needed
by
the
dream
had
to
be
contributed
by
a
wish
and
it
was
the
affair
of
the
worriment
to
procure
for
itself
such
wish
as
a
motive
power
of
the
dream
to
speak
figuratively
it
is
quite
possible
that
a
day
thought
plays
the
part
of
the
contractor
in
the
dream
but
it
is
known
that
no
matter
what
idea
the
contractor
may
have
in
mind
and
how
desirous
he
may
be
of
putting
it
into
operation
he
can
do
nothing
without
capital
he
must
depend
upon
a
capitalist
to
defray
the
necessary
expenses
and
this
capitalist
who
supplies
the
psychic
expenditure
for
the
dream
is
invariably
and
indisputably
wish
from
the
no
matter
what
the
nature
of
the
waking
thought
may
be
in
other
cases
the
capitalist
himself
is
the
contractor
for
the
dream
this
indeed
seems
to
be
the
more
usual
case
an
unconscious
wish
is
produced
by
the
day
work
which
in
turn
creates
the
dream
the
dream
processes
moreover
run
parallel
with
all
the
other
possibilities
of
the
economic
relationship
used
here
as
an
illustration
thus
the
entrepreneur
may
contribute
some
capital
himself
or
several
entrepreneurs
may
seek
the
aid
of
the
same
capitalist
or
several
capitalists
may
jointly
supply
the
capital
required
by
the
entrepreneur
thus
there
are
dreams
produced
by
more
than
one
and
many
similar
variations
which
may
readily
be
passed
over
and
are
of
no
further
interest
to
us
what
we
have
left
unfinished
in
this
discussion
of
the
we
shall
be
able
to
develop
later
the
tertium
comparationis
in
the
comparisons
just
employed
the
sum
placed
at
our
free
disposal
in
proper
allotment
admits
of
still
finer
application
for
the
illustration
of
the
dream
structure
we
can
recognize
in
most
dreams
a
center
especially
supplied
with
perceptible
intensity
this
is
regularly
the
direct
representation
of
the
for
if
we
undo
the
displacements
of
the
by
a
process
of
retrogression
we
find
that
the
psychic
intensity
of
the
elements
in
the
dream
thoughts
is
replaced
by
the
perceptible
intensity
of
the
elements
in
the
dream
content
the
elements
adjoining
the
have
frequently
nothing
to
do
with
its
sense
but
prove
to
be
descendants
of
painful
thoughts
which
oppose
the
wish
but
owing
to
their
frequently
artificial
connection
with
the
central
element
they
have
acquired
sufficient
intensity
to
enable
them
to
come
to
expression
thus
the
force
of
expression
of
the
is
diffused
over
a
certain
sphere
of
association
within
which
it
raises
to
expression
all
elements
including
those
that
are
in
themselves
impotent
in
dreams
having
several
strong
wishes
we
can
readily
separate
from
one
another
the
spheres
of
the
individual
the
gaps
in
the
dream
likewise
can
often
be
explained
as
boundary
zones
although
the
foregoing
remarks
have
considerably
limited
the
significance
of
the
day
remnants
for
the
dream
it
will
nevertheless
be
worth
our
while
to
give
them
some
attention
for
they
must
be
a
necessary
ingredient
in
the
formation
of
the
dream
inasmuch
as
experience
reveals
the
surprising
fact
that
every
dream
shows
in
its
content
a
connection
with
some
impression
of
a
recent
day
often
of
the
most
indifferent
kind
so
far
we
have
failed
to
see
any
necessity
for
this
addition
to
the
dream
mixture
this
necessity
appears
only
when
we
follow
closely
the
part
played
by
the
unconscious
wish
and
then
seek
information
in
the
psychology
of
the
neuroses
we
thus
learn
that
the
unconscious
idea
as
such
is
altogether
incapable
of
entering
into
the
foreconscious
and
that
it
can
exert
an
influence
there
only
by
uniting
with
a
harmless
idea
already
belonging
to
the
foreconscious
to
which
it
transfers
its
intensity
and
under
which
it
allows
itself
to
be
concealed
this
is
the
fact
of
transference
which
furnishes
an
explanation
for
so
many
surprising
occurrences
in
the
psychic
life
of
neurotics
the
idea
from
the
foreconscious
which
thus
obtains
an
unmerited
abundance
of
intensity
may
be
left
unchanged
by
the
transference
or
it
may
have
forced
upon
it
a
modification
from
the
content
of
the
transferring
idea
i
trust
the
reader
will
pardon
my
fondness
for
comparisons
from
daily
life
but
i
feel
tempted
to
say
that
the
relations
existing
for
the
repressed
idea
are
similar
to
the
situations
existing
in
austria
for
the
american
dentist
who
is
forbidden
to
practise
unless
he
gets
permission
from
a
regular
physician
to
use
his
name
on
the
public
signboard
and
thus
cover
the
legal
requirements
moreover
just
as
it
is
naturally
not
the
busiest
physicians
who
form
such
alliances
with
dental
practitioners
so
in
the
psychic
life
only
such
foreconscious
or
conscious
ideas
are
chosen
to
cover
a
repressed
idea
as
have
not
themselves
attracted
much
of
the
attention
which
is
operative
in
the
foreconscious
the
unconscious
entangles
with
its
connections
preferentially
either
those
impressions
and
ideas
of
the
foreconscious
which
have
been
left
unnoticed
as
indifferent
or
those
that
have
soon
been
deprived
of
this
attention
through
rejection
it
is
a
familiar
fact
from
the
association
studies
confirmed
by
every
experience
that
ideas
which
have
formed
intimate
connections
in
one
direction
assume
an
almost
negative
attitude
to
whole
groups
of
new
connections
i
once
tried
from
this
principle
to
develop
a
theory
for
hysterical
paralysis
if
we
assume
that
the
same
need
for
the
transference
of
the
repressed
ideas
which
we
have
learned
to
know
from
the
analysis
of
the
neuroses
makes
its
influence
felt
in
the
dream
as
well
we
can
at
once
explain
two
riddles
of
the
dream
viz
that
every
dream
analysis
shows
an
interweaving
of
a
recent
impression
and
that
this
recent
element
is
frequently
of
the
most
indifferent
character
we
may
add
what
we
have
already
learned
elsewhere
that
these
recent
and
indifferent
elements
come
so
frequently
into
the
dream
content
as
a
substitute
for
the
most
of
the
dream
thoughts
for
the
further
reason
that
they
have
least
to
fear
from
the
resisting
censor
but
while
this
freedom
from
censorship
explains
only
the
preference
for
trivial
elements
the
constant
presence
of
recent
elements
points
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
need
for
transference
both
groups
of
impressions
satisfy
the
demand
of
the
repression
for
material
still
free
from
associations
the
indifferent
ones
because
they
have
offered
no
inducement
for
extensive
associations
and
the
recent
ones
because
they
have
had
insufficient
time
to
form
such
associations
we
thus
see
that
the
day
remnants
among
which
we
may
now
include
the
indifferent
impressions
when
they
participate
in
the
dream
formation
not
only
borrow
from
the
unc
the
motive
power
at
the
disposal
of
the
repressed
wish
but
also
offer
to
the
unconscious
something
indispensable
namely
the
attachment
necessary
to
the
transference
if
we
here
attempted
to
penetrate
more
deeply
into
the
psychic
processes
we
should
first
have
to
throw
more
light
on
the
play
of
emotions
between
the
foreconscious
and
the
unconscious
to
which
indeed
we
are
urged
by
the
study
of
the
psychoneuroses
whereas
the
dream
itself
offers
no
assistance
in
this
respect
just
one
further
remark
about
the
day
remnants
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
are
the
actual
disturbers
of
sleep
and
not
the
dream
which
on
the
contrary
strives
to
guard
sleep
but
we
shall
return
to
this
point
later
we
have
so
far
discussed
the
we
have
traced
it
to
the
sphere
of
the
and
analyzed
its
relations
to
the
day
remnants
which
in
turn
may
be
either
wishes
psychic
emotions
of
any
other
kind
or
simply
recent
impressions
we
have
thus
made
room
for
any
claims
that
may
be
made
for
the
importance
of
conscious
thought
activity
in
dream
formations
in
all
its
variations
relying
upon
our
thought
series
it
would
not
be
at
all
impossible
for
us
to
explain
even
those
extreme
cases
in
which
the
dream
as
a
continuer
of
the
day
work
brings
to
a
happy
conclusion
and
unsolved
problem
possess
an
example
the
analysis
of
which
might
reveal
the
infantile
or
repressed
wish
source
furnishing
such
alliance
and
successful
strengthening
of
the
efforts
of
the
foreconscious
activity
but
we
have
not
come
one
step
nearer
a
solution
of
the
riddle
why
can
the
unconscious
furnish
the
motive
power
for
the
only
during
sleep
the
answer
to
this
question
must
throw
light
on
the
psychic
nature
of
wishes
and
it
will
be
given
with
the
aid
of
the
diagram
of
the
psychic
apparatus
we
do
not
doubt
that
even
this
apparatus
attained
its
present
perfection
through
a
long
course
of
development
let
us
attempt
to
restore
it
as
it
existed
in
an
early
phase
of
its
activity
from
assumptions
to
be
confirmed
elsewhere
we
know
that
at
first
the
apparatus
strove
to
keep
as
free
from
excitement
as
possible
and
in
its
first
formation
therefore
the
scheme
took
the
form
of
a
reflex
apparatus
which
enabled
it
promptly
to
discharge
through
the
motor
tracts
any
sensible
stimulus
reaching
it
from
without
but
this
simple
function
was
disturbed
by
the
wants
of
life
which
likewise
furnish
the
impulse
for
the
further
development
of
the
apparatus
the
wants
of
life
first
manifested
themselves
to
it
in
the
form
of
the
great
physical
needs
the
excitement
aroused
by
the
inner
want
seeks
an
outlet
in
motility
which
may
be
designated
as
inner
changes
or
as
an
expression
of
the
emotions
the
hungry
child
cries
or
fidgets
helplessly
but
its
situation
remains
unchanged
for
the
excitation
proceeding
from
an
inner
want
requires
not
a
momentary
outbreak
but
a
force
working
continuously
a
change
can
occur
only
if
in
some
way
a
feeling
of
gratification
is
experienced
which
in
the
case
of
the
child
must
be
through
outside
help
in
order
to
remove
the
inner
excitement
an
essential
constituent
of
this
experience
is
the
appearance
of
a
certain
perception
of
food
in
our
example
the
memory
picture
of
which
thereafter
remains
associated
with
the
memory
trace
of
the
excitation
of
want
thanks
to
the
established
connection
there
results
at
the
next
appearance
of
this
want
a
psychic
feeling
which
revives
the
memory
picture
of
the
former
perception
and
thus
recalls
the
former
perception
itself
it
actually
the
situation
of
the
first
gratification
we
call
such
a
feeling
a
wish
the
reappearance
of
the
perception
constitutes
the
and
the
full
revival
of
the
perception
by
the
want
excitement
constitutes
the
shortest
road
to
the
we
may
assume
a
primitive
condition
of
the
psychic
apparatus
in
which
this
road
is
really
followed
where
the
wishing
merges
into
an
hallucination
this
first
psychic
activity
therefore
aims
at
an
identity
of
perception
it
aims
at
a
repetition
of
that
perception
which
is
connected
with
the
fulfillment
of
the
want
this
primitive
mental
activity
must
have
been
modified
by
bitter
practical
experience
into
a
more
expedient
secondary
activity
the
establishment
of
the
identity
perception
on
the
short
regressive
road
within
the
apparatus
does
not
in
another
respect
carry
with
it
the
result
which
inevitably
follows
the
revival
of
the
same
perception
from
without
the
gratification
does
not
take
place
and
the
want
continues
in
order
to
equalize
the
internal
with
the
external
sum
of
energy
the
former
must
be
continually
maintained
just
as
actually
happens
in
the
hallucinatory
psychoses
and
in
the
deliriums
of
hunger
which
exhaust
their
psychic
capacity
in
clinging
to
the
object
desired
in
order
to
make
more
appropriate
use
of
the
psychic
force
it
becomes
necessary
to
inhibit
the
full
regression
so
as
to
prevent
it
from
extending
beyond
the
image
of
memory
whence
it
can
select
other
paths
leading
ultimately
to
the
establishment
of
the
desired
identity
from
the
outer
world
this
inhibition
and
consequent
deviation
from
the
excitation
becomes
the
task
of
a
second
system
which
dominates
the
voluntary
motility
through
whose
activity
the
expenditure
of
motility
is
now
devoted
to
previously
recalled
purposes
but
this
entire
complicated
mental
activity
which
works
its
way
from
the
memory
picture
to
the
establishment
of
the
perception
identity
from
the
outer
world
merely
represents
a
detour
which
has
been
forced
upon
the
by
experience
thinking
is
indeed
nothing
but
the
equivalent
of
the
hallucinatory
wish
and
if
the
dream
be
called
a
this
becomes
as
nothing
but
a
wish
can
impel
our
psychic
apparatus
to
activity
the
dream
which
in
fulfilling
its
wishes
follows
the
short
regressive
path
thereby
preserves
for
us
only
an
example
of
the
primary
form
of
the
psychic
apparatus
which
has
been
abandoned
as
inexpedient
what
once
ruled
in
the
waking
state
when
the
psychic
life
was
still
young
and
unfit
seems
to
have
been
banished
into
the
sleeping
state
just
as
we
see
again
in
the
nursery
the
bow
and
arrow
the
discarded
primitive
weapons
of
humanity
dream
is
a
fragment
of
the
abandoned
psychic
life
of
the
in
the
psychoses
these
modes
of
operation
of
the
psychic
apparatus
which
are
normally
suppressed
in
the
waking
state
reassert
themselves
and
then
betray
their
inability
to
satisfy
our
wants
in
the
outer
world
the
unconscious
evidently
strive
to
assert
themselves
during
the
day
also
and
the
fact
of
transference
and
the
psychoses
teach
us
that
they
endeavor
to
penetrate
to
consciousness
and
dominate
motility
by
the
road
leading
through
the
system
of
the
foreconscious
it
is
therefore
the
censor
lying
between
the
unc
and
the
the
assumption
of
which
is
forced
upon
us
by
the
dream
that
we
have
to
recognize
and
honor
as
the
guardian
of
our
psychic
health
but
is
it
not
carelessness
on
the
part
of
this
guardian
to
diminish
its
vigilance
during
the
night
and
to
allow
the
suppressed
emotions
of
the
unc
to
come
to
expression
thus
again
making
possible
the
hallucinatory
regression
i
think
not
for
when
the
critical
guardian
goes
to
rest
and
we
have
proof
that
his
slumber
is
not
profound
he
takes
care
to
close
the
gate
to
motility
no
matter
what
feelings
from
the
otherwise
inhibited
unc
may
roam
about
on
the
scene
they
need
not
be
interfered
with
they
remain
harmless
because
they
are
unable
to
put
in
motion
the
motor
apparatus
which
alone
can
exert
a
modifying
influence
upon
the
outer
world
sleep
guarantees
the
security
of
the
fortress
which
is
under
guard
conditions
are
less
harmless
when
a
displacement
of
forces
is
produced
not
through
a
nocturnal
diminution
in
the
operation
of
the
critical
censor
but
through
pathological
enfeeblement
of
the
latter
or
through
pathological
reinforcement
of
the
unconscious
excitations
and
this
while
the
foreconscious
is
charged
with
energy
and
the
avenues
to
motility
are
open
the
guardian
is
then
overpowered
the
unconscious
excitations
subdue
the
forec
through
it
they
dominate
our
speech
and
actions
or
they
enforce
the
hallucinatory
regression
thus
governing
an
apparatus
not
designed
for
them
by
virtue
of
the
attraction
exerted
by
the
perceptions
on
the
distribution
of
our
psychic
energy
we
call
this
condition
a
psychosis
we
are
now
in
the
best
position
to
complete
our
psychological
construction
which
has
been
interrupted
by
the
introduction
of
the
two
systems
unc
and
forec
we
have
still
however
ample
reason
for
giving
further
consideration
to
the
wish
as
the
sole
psychic
motive
power
in
the
dream
we
have
explained
that
the
reason
why
the
dream
is
in
every
case
a
wish
realization
is
because
it
is
a
product
of
the
which
knows
no
other
aim
in
its
activity
but
the
fulfillment
of
wishes
and
which
has
no
other
forces
at
its
disposal
but
if
we
avail
ourselves
for
a
moment
longer
of
the
right
to
elaborate
from
the
dream
interpretation
such
psychological
speculations
we
are
in
duty
bound
to
demonstrate
that
we
are
thereby
bringing
the
dream
into
a
relationship
which
may
also
comprise
other
psychic
structures
if
there
exists
a
system
of
the
or
something
sufficiently
analogous
to
it
for
the
purpose
of
our
discussion
the
dream
can
not
be
its
sole
manifestation
every
dream
may
be
a
but
there
must
be
other
forms
of
abnormal
beside
this
of
dreams
indeed
the
theory
of
all
psychoneurotic
symptoms
culminates
in
the
proposition
they
too
must
be
taken
as
of
the
our
explanation
makes
the
dream
only
the
first
member
of
a
group
most
important
for
the
psychiatrist
an
understanding
of
which
means
the
solution
of
the
purely
psychological
part
of
the
psychiatric
problem
but
other
members
of
this
group
of
the
hysterical
symptoms
evince
one
essential
quality
which
i
have
so
far
failed
to
find
in
the
dream
thus
from
the
investigations
frequently
referred
to
in
this
treatise
i
know
that
the
formation
of
an
hysterical
symptom
necessitates
the
combination
of
both
streams
of
our
psychic
life
the
symptom
is
not
merely
the
expression
of
a
realized
unconscious
wish
but
it
must
be
joined
by
another
wish
from
the
foreconscious
which
is
fulfilled
by
the
same
symptom
so
that
the
symptom
is
at
least
doubly
determined
once
by
each
one
of
the
conflicting
systems
just
as
in
the
dream
there
is
no
limit
to
further
the
determination
not
derived
from
the
unc
is
as
far
as
i
can
see
invariably
a
stream
of
thought
in
reaction
against
the
unconscious
wish
a
hence
i
may
say
in
general
that
hysterical
symptom
originates
only
where
two
contrasting
having
their
source
in
different
psychic
systems
are
able
to
combine
in
one
compare
my
latest
formulation
of
the
origin
of
the
hysterical
symptoms
in
a
treatise
published
by
the
für
by
hirschfeld
and
others
examples
on
this
point
would
prove
of
little
value
as
nothing
but
a
complete
unveiling
of
the
complication
in
question
would
carry
conviction
i
therefore
content
myself
with
the
mere
assertion
and
will
cite
an
example
not
for
conviction
but
for
explication
the
hysterical
vomiting
of
a
female
patient
proved
on
the
one
hand
to
be
the
realization
of
an
unconscious
fancy
from
the
time
of
puberty
that
she
might
be
continuously
pregnant
and
have
a
multitude
of
children
and
this
was
subsequently
united
with
the
wish
that
she
might
have
them
from
as
many
men
as
possible
against
this
immoderate
wish
there
arose
a
powerful
defensive
impulse
but
as
the
vomiting
might
spoil
the
patient
figure
and
beauty
so
that
she
would
not
find
favor
in
the
eyes
of
mankind
the
symptom
was
therefore
in
keeping
with
her
punitive
trend
of
thought
and
being
thus
admissible
from
both
sides
it
was
allowed
to
become
a
reality
this
is
the
same
manner
of
consenting
to
a
which
the
queen
of
the
parthians
chose
for
the
triumvir
crassus
believing
that
he
had
undertaken
the
campaign
out
of
greed
for
gold
she
caused
molten
gold
to
be
poured
into
the
throat
of
the
corpse
now
hast
thou
what
thou
hast
longed
for
as
yet
we
know
of
the
dream
only
that
it
expresses
a
of
the
unconscious
and
apparently
the
dominating
foreconscious
permits
this
only
after
it
has
subjected
the
wish
to
some
distortions
we
are
really
in
no
position
to
demonstrate
regularly
a
stream
of
thought
antagonistic
to
the
which
is
realized
in
the
dream
as
in
its
counterpart
only
now
and
then
have
we
found
in
the
dream
traces
of
reaction
formations
as
for
instance
the
tenderness
toward
friend
in
the
uncle
dream
but
the
contribution
from
the
foreconscious
which
is
missing
here
may
be
found
in
another
place
while
the
dominating
system
has
withdrawn
on
the
wish
to
sleep
the
dream
may
bring
to
expression
with
manifold
distortions
a
wish
from
the
and
realize
this
wish
by
producing
the
necessary
changes
of
energy
in
the
psychic
apparatus
and
may
finally
retain
it
through
the
entire
duration
of
sleep
this
persistent
wish
to
sleep
on
the
part
of
the
foreconscious
in
general
facilitates
the
formation
of
the
dream
let
us
refer
to
the
dream
of
the
father
who
by
the
gleam
of
light
from
the
death
chamber
was
brought
to
the
conclusion
that
the
body
has
been
set
on
fire
we
have
shown
that
one
of
the
psychic
forces
decisive
in
causing
the
father
to
form
this
conclusion
instead
of
being
awakened
by
the
gleam
of
light
was
the
wish
to
prolong
the
life
of
the
child
seen
in
the
dream
by
one
moment
other
wishes
proceeding
from
the
repression
probably
escape
us
because
we
are
unable
to
analyze
this
dream
but
as
a
second
motive
power
of
the
dream
we
may
mention
the
father
desire
to
sleep
for
like
the
life
of
the
child
the
sleep
of
the
father
is
prolonged
for
a
moment
by
the
dream
the
underlying
motive
is
let
the
dream
go
on
otherwise
i
must
wake
up
as
in
this
dream
so
also
in
all
other
dreams
the
wish
to
sleep
lends
its
support
to
the
unconscious
wish
we
reported
dreams
which
were
apparently
dreams
of
convenience
but
properly
speaking
all
dreams
may
claim
this
designation
the
efficacy
of
the
wish
to
continue
to
sleep
is
the
most
easily
recognized
in
the
waking
dreams
which
so
transform
the
objective
sensory
stimulus
as
to
render
it
compatible
with
the
continuance
of
sleep
they
interweave
this
stimulus
with
the
dream
in
order
to
rob
it
of
any
claims
it
might
make
as
a
warning
to
the
outer
world
but
this
wish
to
continue
to
sleep
must
also
participate
in
the
formation
of
all
other
dreams
which
may
disturb
the
sleeping
state
from
within
only
now
then
sleep
on
why
it
but
a
dream
this
is
in
many
cases
the
suggestion
of
the
forec
to
consciousness
when
the
dream
goes
too
far
and
this
also
describes
in
a
general
way
the
attitude
of
our
dominating
psychic
activity
toward
dreaming
though
the
thought
remains
tacit
i
must
draw
the
conclusion
that
our
entire
sleeping
state
we
are
just
as
certain
that
we
are
dreaming
as
we
are
certain
that
we
are
we
are
compelled
to
disregard
the
objection
urged
against
this
conclusion
that
our
consciousness
is
never
directed
to
a
knowledge
of
the
former
and
that
it
is
directed
to
a
knowledge
of
the
latter
only
on
special
occasions
when
the
censor
is
unexpectedly
surprised
against
this
objection
we
may
say
that
there
are
persons
who
are
entirely
conscious
of
their
sleeping
and
dreaming
and
who
are
apparently
endowed
with
the
conscious
faculty
of
guiding
their
dream
life
such
a
dreamer
when
dissatisfied
with
the
course
taken
by
the
dream
breaks
it
off
without
awakening
and
begins
it
anew
in
order
to
continue
it
with
a
different
turn
like
the
popular
author
who
on
request
gives
a
happier
ending
to
his
play
or
at
another
time
if
placed
by
the
dream
in
a
sexually
exciting
situation
he
thinks
in
his
sleep
i
do
not
care
to
continue
this
dream
and
exhaust
myself
by
a
pollution
i
prefer
to
defer
it
in
favor
of
a
real
situation
they
share
this
character
of
indestructibility
with
all
psychic
acts
that
are
really
unconscious
that
is
with
psychic
acts
belonging
to
the
system
of
the
unconscious
only
these
paths
are
constantly
open
and
never
fall
into
disuse
they
conduct
the
discharge
of
the
exciting
process
as
often
as
it
becomes
endowed
with
unconscious
excitement
to
speak
metaphorically
they
suffer
the
same
form
of
annihilation
as
the
shades
of
the
lower
region
in
the
who
awoke
to
new
life
the
moment
they
drank
blood
the
processes
depending
on
the
foreconscious
system
are
destructible
in
a
different
way
the
psychotherapy
of
the
neuroses
is
based
on
this
difference
le

of

has
been
borrowed
from
theory
of
by

revived

in

paris
vii
the
function
of
the
dream
since
we
know
that
the
foreconscious
is
suspended
during
the
night
by
the
wish
to
sleep
we
can
proceed
to
an
intelligent
investigation
of
the
dream
process
but
let
us
first
sum
up
the
knowledge
of
this
process
already
gained
we
have
shown
that
the
waking
activity
leaves
day
remnants
from
which
the
sum
of
energy
can
not
be
entirely
removed
or
the
waking
activity
revives
during
the
day
one
of
the
unconscious
wishes
or
both
conditions
occur
simultaneously
we
have
already
discovered
the
many
variations
that
may
take
place
the
unconscious
wish
has
already
made
its
way
to
the
day
remnants
either
during
the
day
or
at
any
rate
with
the
beginning
of
sleep
and
has
effected
a
transference
to
it
this
produces
a
wish
transferred
to
the
recent
material
or
the
suppressed
recent
wish
comes
to
life
again
through
a
reinforcement
from
the
unconscious
this
wish
now
endeavors
to
make
its
way
to
consciousness
on
the
normal
path
of
the
mental
processes
through
the
foreconscious
to
which
indeed
it
belongs
through
one
of
its
constituent
elements
it
is
confronted
however
by
the
censor
which
is
still
active
and
to
the
influence
of
which
it
now
succumbs
it
now
takes
on
the
distortion
for
which
the
way
has
already
been
paved
by
its
transference
to
the
recent
material
thus
far
it
is
in
the
way
of
becoming
something
resembling
an
obsession
delusion
or
the
like
a
thought
reinforced
by
a
transference
and
distorted
in
expression
by
the
censor
but
its
further
progress
is
now
checked
through
the
dormant
state
of
the
foreconscious
this
system
has
apparently
protected
itself
against
invasion
by
diminishing
its
excitements
the
dream
process
therefore
takes
the
regressive
course
which
has
just
been
opened
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
sleeping
state
and
thereby
follows
the
attraction
exerted
on
it
by
the
memory
groups
which
themselves
exist
in
part
only
as
visual
energy
not
yet
translated
into
terms
of
the
later
systems
on
its
way
to
regression
the
dream
takes
on
the
form
of
dramatization
the
subject
of
compression
will
be
discussed
later
the
dream
process
has
now
terminated
the
second
part
of
its
repeatedly
impeded
course
the
first
part
expended
itself
progressively
from
the
unconscious
scenes
or
phantasies
to
the
foreconscious
while
the
second
part
gravitates
from
the
advent
of
the
censor
back
to
the
perceptions
but
when
the
dream
process
becomes
a
content
of
perception
it
has
so
to
speak
eluded
the
obstacle
set
up
in
the
forec
by
the
censor
and
by
the
sleeping
state
it
succeeds
in
drawing
attention
to
itself
and
in
being
noticed
by
consciousness
for
consciousness
which
means
to
us
a
sensory
organ
for
the
reception
of
psychic
qualities
may
receive
stimuli
from
two
sources
first
from
the
periphery
of
the
entire
apparatus
viz
from
the
perception
system
and
secondly
from
the
pleasure
and
pain
stimuli
which
constitute
the
sole
psychic
quality
produced
in
the
transformation
of
energy
within
the
apparatus
all
other
processes
in
the
system
even
those
in
the
foreconscious
are
devoid
of
any
psychic
quality
and
are
therefore
not
objects
of
consciousness
inasmuch
as
they
do
not
furnish
pleasure
or
pain
for
perception
we
shall
have
to
assume
that
those
liberations
of
pleasure
and
pain
automatically
regulate
the
outlet
of
the
occupation
processes
but
in
order
to
make
possible
more
delicate
functions
it
was
later
found
necessary
to
render
the
course
of
the
presentations
more
independent
of
the
manifestations
of
pain
to
accomplish
this
the
forec
system
needed
some
qualities
of
its
own
which
could
attract
consciousness
and
most
probably
received
them
through
the
connection
of
the
foreconscious
processes
with
the
memory
system
of
the
signs
of
speech
which
is
not
devoid
of
qualities
through
the
qualities
of
this
system
consciousness
which
had
hitherto
been
a
sensory
organ
only
for
the
perceptions
now
becomes
also
a
sensory
organ
for
a
part
of
our
mental
processes
thus
we
have
now
as
it
were
two
sensory
surfaces
one
directed
to
perceptions
and
the
other
to
the
foreconscious
mental
processes
i
must
assume
that
the
sensory
surface
of
consciousness
devoted
to
the
forec
is
rendered
less
excitable
by
sleep
than
that
directed
to
the
the
giving
up
of
interest
for
the
nocturnal
mental
processes
is
indeed
purposeful
nothing
is
to
disturb
the
mind
the
forec
wants
to
sleep
but
once
the
dream
becomes
a
perception
it
is
then
capable
of
exciting
consciousness
through
the
qualities
thus
gained
the
sensory
stimulus
accomplishes
what
it
was
really
destined
for
namely
it
directs
a
part
of
the
energy
at
the
disposal
of
the
forec
in
the
form
of
attention
upon
the
stimulant
we
must
therefore
admit
that
the
dream
invariably
awakens
us
that
is
it
puts
into
activity
a
part
of
the
dormant
force
of
the
forec
this
force
imparts
to
the
dream
that
influence
which
we
have
designated
as
secondary
elaboration
for
the
sake
of
connection
and
comprehensibility
this
means
that
the
dream
is
treated
by
it
like
any
other
content
of
perception
it
is
subjected
to
the
same
ideas
of
expectation
as
far
at
least
as
the
material
admits
as
far
as
the
direction
is
concerned
in
this
third
part
of
the
dream
it
may
be
said
that
here
again
the
movement
is
progressive
to
avoid
misunderstanding
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
temporal
peculiarities
of
these
dream
processes
in
a
very
interesting
discussion
apparently
suggested
by
maury
puzzling
guillotine
dream
goblet
tries
to
demonstrate
that
the
dream
requires
no
other
time
than
the
transition
period
between
sleeping
and
awakening
the
awakening
requires
time
as
the
dream
takes
place
during
that
period
one
is
inclined
to
believe
that
the
final
picture
of
the
dream
is
so
strong
that
it
forces
the
dreamer
to
awaken
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
picture
is
strong
only
because
the
dreamer
is
already
very
near
awakening
when
it
appears
un
rêve
un
réveil
qui
commence
it
has
already
been
emphasized
by
dugas
that
goblet
was
forced
to
repudiate
many
facts
in
order
to
generalize
his
theory
there
are
moreover
dreams
from
which
we
do
not
awaken
some
dreams
in
which
we
dream
that
we
dream
from
our
knowledge
of
the
we
can
by
no
means
admit
that
it
extends
only
over
the
period
of
awakening
on
the
contrary
we
must
consider
it
probable
that
the
first
part
of
the
begins
during
the
day
when
we
are
still
under
the
domination
of
the
foreconscious
the
second
phase
of
the
viz
the
modification
through
the
censor
the
attraction
by
the
unconscious
scenes
and
the
penetration
to
perception
must
continue
throughout
the
night
and
we
are
probably
always
right
when
we
assert
that
we
feel
as
though
we
had
been
dreaming
the
whole
night
although
we
can
not
say
what
i
do
not
however
think
it
necessary
to
assume
that
up
to
the
time
of
becoming
conscious
the
dream
processes
really
follow
the
temporal
sequence
which
we
have
described
viz
that
there
is
first
the
transferred
then
the
distortion
of
the
censor
and
consequently
the
change
of
direction
to
regression
and
so
on
we
were
forced
to
form
such
a
succession
for
the
sake
of
in
reality
however
it
is
much
rather
a
matter
of
simultaneously
trying
this
path
and
that
and
of
emotions
fluctuating
to
and
fro
until
finally
owing
to
the
most
expedient
distribution
one
particular
grouping
is
secured
which
remains
from
certain
personal
experiences
i
am
myself
inclined
to
believe
that
the
often
requires
more
than
one
day
and
one
night
to
produce
its
result
if
this
be
true
the
extraordinary
art
manifested
in
the
construction
of
the
dream
loses
all
its
marvels
in
my
opinion
even
the
regard
for
comprehensibility
as
an
occurrence
of
perception
may
take
effect
before
the
dream
attracts
consciousness
to
itself
to
be
sure
from
now
on
the
process
is
accelerated
as
the
dream
is
henceforth
subjected
to
the
same
treatment
as
any
other
perception
it
is
like
fireworks
which
require
hours
of
preparation
and
only
a
moment
for
ignition
through
the
the
dream
process
now
gains
either
sufficient
intensity
to
attract
consciousness
to
itself
and
arouse
the
foreconscious
which
is
quite
independent
of
the
time
or
profundity
of
sleep
or
its
intensity
being
insufficient
it
must
wait
until
it
meets
the
attention
which
is
set
in
motion
immediately
before
awakening
most
dreams
seem
to
operate
with
relatively
slight
psychic
intensities
for
they
wait
for
the
awakening
this
however
explains
the
fact
that
we
regularly
perceive
something
dreamt
on
being
suddenly
aroused
from
a
sound
sleep
here
as
well
as
in
spontaneous
awakening
the
first
glance
strikes
the
perception
content
created
by
the
while
the
next
strikes
the
one
produced
from
without
but
of
greater
theoretical
interest
are
those
dreams
which
are
capable
of
waking
us
in
the
midst
of
sleep
we
must
bear
in
mind
the
expediency
elsewhere
universally
demonstrated
and
ask
ourselves
why
the
dream
or
the
unconscious
wish
has
the
power
to
disturb
sleep
the
fulfillment
of
the
foreconscious
wish
this
is
probably
due
to
certain
relations
of
energy
into
which
we
have
no
insight
if
we
possessed
such
insight
we
should
probably
find
that
the
freedom
given
to
the
dream
and
the
expenditure
of
a
certain
amount
of
detached
attention
represent
for
the
dream
an
economy
in
energy
keeping
in
view
the
fact
that
the
unconscious
must
be
held
in
check
at
night
just
as
during
the
day
we
know
from
experience
that
the
dream
even
if
it
interrupts
sleep
repeatedly
during
the
same
night
still
remains
compatible
with
sleep
we
wake
up
for
an
instant
and
immediately
resume
our
sleep
it
is
like
driving
off
a
fly
during
sleep
we
awake
and
when
we
resume
our
sleep
we
have
removed
the
disturbance
as
demonstrated
by
familiar
examples
from
the
sleep
of
wet
nurses
the
fulfillment
of
the
wish
to
sleep
is
quite
compatible
with
the
retention
of
a
certain
amount
of
attention
in
a
given
direction
but
we
must
here
take
cognizance
of
an
objection
that
is
based
on
a
better
knowledge
of
the
unconscious
processes
although
we
have
ourselves
described
the
unconscious
wishes
as
always
active
we
have
nevertheless
asserted
that
they
are
not
sufficiently
strong
during
the
day
to
make
themselves
perceptible
but
when
we
sleep
and
the
unconscious
wish
has
shown
its
power
to
form
a
dream
and
with
it
to
awaken
the
foreconscious
why
then
does
this
power
become
exhausted
after
the
dream
has
been
taken
cognizance
of
would
it
not
seem
more
probable
that
the
dream
should
continually
renew
itself
like
the
troublesome
fly
which
when
driven
away
takes
pleasure
in
returning
again
and
again
what
justifies
our
assertion
that
the
dream
removes
the
disturbance
of
sleep
that
the
unconscious
wishes
always
remain
active
is
quite
true
they
represent
paths
which
are
passable
whenever
a
sum
of
excitement
makes
use
of
them
moreover
a
remarkable
peculiarity
of
the
unconscious
processes
is
the
fact
that
they
remain
indestructible
nothing
can
be
brought
to
an
end
in
the
unconscious
nothing
can
cease
or
be
forgotten
this
impression
is
most
strongly
gained
in
the
study
of
the
neuroses
especially
of
hysteria
the
unconscious
stream
of
thought
which
leads
to
the
discharge
through
an
attack
becomes
passable
again
as
soon
as
there
is
an
accumulation
of
a
sufficient
amount
of
excitement
the
mortification
brought
on
thirty
years
ago
after
having
gained
access
to
the
unconscious
affective
source
operates
during
all
these
thirty
years
like
a
recent
one
whenever
its
memory
is
touched
it
is
revived
and
shows
itself
to
be
supplied
with
the
excitement
which
is
discharged
in
a
motor
attack
it
is
just
here
that
the
office
of
psychotherapy
begins
its
task
being
to
bring
about
adjustment
and
forgetfulness
for
the
unconscious
processes
indeed
the
fading
of
memories
and
the
flagging
of
affects
which
we
are
apt
to
take
as
and
to
explain
as
a
primary
influence
of
time
on
the
psychic
memories
are
in
reality
secondary
changes
brought
about
by
painstaking
work
it
is
the
foreconscious
that
accomplishes
this
work
and
the
only
course
to
be
pursued
by
psychotherapy
is
the
subjugate
the
unc
to
the
domination
of
the
forec
there
are
therefore
two
exits
for
the
individual
unconscious
emotional
process
it
is
either
left
to
itself
in
which
case
it
ultimately
breaks
through
somewhere
and
secures
for
once
a
discharge
for
its
excitation
into
motility
or
it
succumbs
to
the
influence
of
the
foreconscious
and
its
excitation
becomes
confined
through
this
influence
instead
of
being
discharged
it
is
the
latter
process
that
occurs
in
the
dream
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
is
directed
by
the
conscious
excitement
the
energy
from
the
which
confronts
the
dream
when
grown
to
perception
restricts
the
unconscious
excitement
of
the
dream
and
renders
it
harmless
as
a
disturbing
factor
when
the
dreamer
wakes
up
for
a
moment
he
has
actually
chased
away
the
fly
that
has
threatened
to
disturb
his
sleep
we
can
now
understand
that
it
is
really
more
expedient
and
economical
to
give
full
sway
to
the
unconscious
wish
and
clear
its
way
to
regression
so
that
it
may
form
a
dream
and
then
restrict
and
adjust
this
dream
by
means
of
a
small
expenditure
of
foreconscious
labor
than
to
curb
the
unconscious
throughout
the
entire
period
of
sleep
we
should
indeed
expect
that
the
dream
even
if
it
was
not
originally
an
expedient
process
would
have
acquired
some
function
in
the
play
of
forces
of
the
psychic
life
we
now
see
what
this
function
is
the
dream
has
taken
it
upon
itself
to
bring
the
liberated
excitement
of
the
unc
back
under
the
domination
of
the
foreconscious
it
thus
affords
relief
for
the
excitement
of
the
unc
and
acts
as
a
for
the
latter
and
at
the
same
time
it
insures
the
sleep
of
the
foreconscious
at
a
slight
expenditure
of
the
waking
state
like
the
other
psychic
formations
of
its
group
the
dream
offers
itself
as
a
compromise
serving
simultaneously
both
systems
by
fulfilling
both
wishes
in
so
far
as
they
are
compatible
with
each
other
a
glance
at
robert
elimination
theory
will
show
that
we
must
agree
with
this
author
in
his
main
point
viz
in
the
determination
of
the
function
of
the
dream
though
we
differ
from
him
in
our
hypotheses
and
in
our
treatment
of
the
dream
process
the
above
qualification
in
so
far
as
the
two
wishes
are
compatible
with
each
other
contains
a
suggestion
that
there
may
be
cases
in
which
the
function
of
the
dream
suffers
shipwreck
the
dream
process
is
in
the
first
instance
admitted
as
a
of
the
unconscious
but
if
this
tentative
disturbs
the
foreconscious
to
such
an
extent
that
the
latter
can
no
longer
maintain
its
rest
the
dream
then
breaks
the
compromise
and
fails
to
perform
the
second
part
of
its
task
it
is
then
at
once
broken
off
and
replaced
by
complete
wakefulness
here
too
it
is
not
really
the
fault
of
the
dream
if
while
ordinarily
the
guardian
of
sleep
it
is
here
compelled
to
appear
as
the
disturber
of
sleep
nor
should
this
cause
us
to
entertain
any
doubts
as
to
its
efficacy
this
is
not
the
only
case
in
the
organism
in
which
an
otherwise
efficacious
arrangement
became
inefficacious
and
disturbing
as
soon
as
some
element
is
changed
in
the
conditions
of
its
origin
the
disturbance
then
serves
at
least
the
new
purpose
of
announcing
the
change
and
calling
into
play
against
it
the
means
of
adjustment
of
the
organism
in
this
connection
i
naturally
bear
in
mind
the
case
of
the
anxiety
dream
and
in
order
not
to
have
the
appearance
of
trying
to
exclude
this
testimony
against
the
theory
of
wherever
i
encounter
it
i
will
attempt
an
explanation
of
the
anxiety
dream
at
least
offering
some
suggestions
that
a
psychic
process
developing
anxiety
may
still
be
a
has
long
ceased
to
impress
us
as
a
contradiction
we
may
explain
this
occurrence
by
the
fact
that
the
wish
belongs
to
one
system
the
unc
while
by
the
other
system
the
forec
this
wish
has
been
rejected
and
suppressed
the
subjection
of
the
unc
by
the
forec
is
not
complete
even
in
perfect
psychic
health
the
amount
of
this
suppression
shows
the
degree
of
our
psychic
normality
neurotic
symptoms
show
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
two
systems
the
symptoms
are
the
results
of
a
compromise
of
this
conflict
and
they
temporarily
put
an
end
to
it
on
the
one
hand
they
afford
the
unc
an
outlet
for
the
discharge
of
its
excitement
and
serve
it
as
a
sally
port
while
on
the
other
hand
they
give
the
forec
the
capability
of
dominating
the
unc
to
some
extent
it
is
highly
instructive
to
consider
the
significance
of
any
hysterical
phobia
or
of
an
agoraphobia
suppose
a
neurotic
incapable
of
crossing
the
street
alone
which
we
would
justly
call
a
symptom
we
attempt
to
remove
this
symptom
by
urging
him
to
the
action
which
he
deems
himself
incapable
of
the
result
will
be
an
attack
of
anxiety
just
as
an
attack
of
anxiety
in
the
street
has
often
been
the
cause
of
establishing
an
agoraphobia
we
thus
learn
that
the
symptom
has
been
constituted
in
order
to
guard
against
the
outbreak
of
the
anxiety
the
phobia
is
thrown
before
the
anxiety
like
a
fortress
on
the
frontier
unless
we
enter
into
the
part
played
by
the
affects
in
these
processes
which
can
be
done
here
only
imperfectly
we
can
not
continue
our
discussion
let
us
therefore
advance
the
proposition
that
the
reason
why
the
suppression
of
the
unconscious
becomes
absolutely
necessary
is
because
if
the
discharge
of
presentation
should
be
left
to
itself
it
would
develop
an
affect
in
the
unc
which
originally
bore
the
character
of
pleasure
but
which
since
the
appearance
of
the
repression
bears
the
character
of
pain
the
aim
as
well
as
the
result
of
the
suppression
is
to
stop
the
development
of
this
pain
the
suppression
extends
over
the
unconscious
ideation
because
the
liberation
of
pain
might
emanate
from
the
ideation
the
foundation
is
here
laid
for
a
very
definite
assumption
concerning
the
nature
of
the
affective
development
it
is
regarded
as
a
motor
or
secondary
activity
the
key
to
the
innervation
of
which
is
located
in
the
presentations
of
the
unc
through
the
domination
of
the
forec
these
presentations
become
as
it
were
throttled
and
inhibited
at
the
exit
of
the
impulses
the
danger
which
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
forec
ceases
to
occupy
the
energy
therefore
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
unconscious
excitations
liberate
such
an
affect
as
in
consequence
of
the
repression
that
has
previously
taken
place
can
only
be
perceived
as
pain
or
anxiety
this
danger
is
released
through
the
full
sway
of
the
dream
process
the
determinations
for
its
realization
consist
in
the
fact
that
repressions
have
taken
place
and
that
the
suppressed
emotional
wishes
shall
become
sufficiently
strong
they
thus
stand
entirely
without
the
psychological
realm
of
the
dream
structure
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
our
subject
is
connected
through
just
one
factor
namely
the
freeing
of
the
unc
during
sleep
with
the
subject
of
the
development
of
anxiety
i
could
dispense
with
discussion
of
the
anxiety
dream
and
thus
avoid
all
obscurities
connected
with
it
as
i
have
often
repeated
the
theory
of
the
anxiety
belongs
to
the
psychology
of
the
neuroses
i
would
say
that
the
anxiety
in
the
dream
is
an
anxiety
problem
and
not
a
dream
problem
we
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
it
after
having
once
demonstrated
its
point
of
contact
with
the
subject
of
the
dream
process
there
is
only
one
thing
left
for
me
to
do
as
i
have
asserted
that
the
neurotic
anxiety
originates
from
sexual
sources
i
can
subject
anxiety
dreams
to
analysis
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
sexual
material
in
their
dream
thoughts
for
good
reasons
i
refrain
from
citing
here
any
of
the
numerous
examples
placed
at
my
disposal
by
neurotic
patients
but
prefer
to
give
anxiety
dreams
from
young
persons
personally
i
have
had
no
real
anxiety
dream
for
decades
but
i
recall
one
from
my
seventh
or
eighth
year
which
i
subjected
to
interpretation
about
thirty
years
later
the
dream
was
very
vivid
and
showed
me
beloved
mother
with
peculiarly
calm
sleeping
countenance
carried
into
the
room
and
laid
on
the
bed
by
two
or
three
persons
with
i
awoke
crying
and
screaming
and
disturbed
my
parents
the
very
tall
figures
draped
in
a
peculiar
manner
with
beaks
i
had
taken
from
the
illustrations
of
philippson
bible
i
believe
they
represented
deities
with
heads
of
sparrowhawks
from
an
egyptian
tomb
relief
the
analysis
also
introduced
the
reminiscence
of
a
naughty
janitor
boy
who
used
to
play
with
us
children
on
the
meadow
in
front
of
the
house
i
would
add
that
his
name
was
philip
i
feel
that
i
first
heard
from
this
boy
the
vulgar
word
signifying
sexual
intercourse
which
is
replaced
among
the
educated
by
the
latin
coitus
but
to
which
the
dream
distinctly
alludes
by
the
selection
of
the
birds
heads
i
must
have
suspected
the
sexual
significance
of
the
word
from
the
facial
expression
of
my
teacher
my
mother
features
in
the
dream
were
copied
from
the
countenance
of
my
grandfather
whom
i
had
seen
a
few
days
before
his
death
snoring
in
the
state
of
coma
the
interpretation
of
the
secondary
elaboration
in
the
dream
must
therefore
have
been
that
my
mother
was
dying
the
tomb
relief
too
agrees
with
this
in
this
anxiety
i
awoke
and
could
not
calm
myself
until
i
had
awakened
my
parents
i
remember
that
i
suddenly
became
calm
on
coming
face
to
face
with
my
mother
as
if
i
needed
the
assurance
that
my
mother
was
not
dead
but
this
secondary
interpretation
of
the
dream
had
been
effected
only
under
the
influence
of
the
developed
anxiety
i
was
not
frightened
because
i
dreamed
that
my
mother
was
dying
but
i
interpreted
the
dream
in
this
manner
in
the
foreconscious
elaboration
because
i
was
already
under
the
domination
of
the
anxiety
the
latter
however
could
be
traced
by
means
of
the
repression
to
an
obscure
obviously
sexual
desire
which
had
found
its
satisfying
expression
in
the
visual
content
of
the
dream
a
man
years
old
who
had
been
severely
ill
for
a
year
had
had
many
terrifying
dreams
between
the
ages
of
eleven
and
thirteen
he
thought
that
a
man
with
an
ax
was
running
after
him
he
wished
to
run
but
felt
paralyzed
and
could
not
move
from
the
spot
this
may
be
taken
as
a
good
example
of
a
very
common
and
apparently
sexually
indifferent
anxiety
dream
in
the
analysis
the
dreamer
first
thought
of
a
story
told
him
by
his
uncle
which
chronologically
was
later
than
the
dream
viz
that
he
was
attacked
at
night
by
a
individual
this
occurrence
led
him
to
believe
that
he
himself
might
have
already
heard
of
a
similar
episode
at
the
time
of
the
dream
in
connection
with
the
ax
he
recalled
that
during
that
period
of
his
life
he
once
hurt
his
hand
with
an
ax
while
chopping
wood
this
immediately
led
to
his
relations
with
his
younger
brother
whom
he
used
to
maltreat
and
knock
down
in
particular
he
recalled
an
occasion
when
he
struck
his
brother
on
the
head
with
his
boot
until
he
bled
whereupon
his
mother
remarked
i
fear
he
will
kill
him
some
day
while
he
was
seemingly
thinking
of
the
subject
of
violence
a
reminiscence
from
his
ninth
year
suddenly
occurred
to
him
his
parents
came
home
late
and
went
to
bed
while
he
was
feigning
sleep
he
soon
heard
panting
and
other
noises
that
appeared
strange
to
him
and
he
could
also
make
out
the
position
of
his
parents
in
bed
his
further
associations
showed
that
he
had
established
an
analogy
between
this
relation
between
his
parents
and
his
own
relation
toward
his
younger
brother
he
subsumed
what
occurred
between
his
parents
under
the
conception
violence
and
wrestling
and
thus
reached
a
sadistic
conception
of
the
coitus
act
as
often
happens
among
children
the
fact
that
he
often
noticed
blood
on
his
mother
bed
corroborated
his
conception
that
the
sexual
intercourse
of
adults
appears
strange
to
children
who
observe
it
and
arouses
fear
in
them
i
dare
say
is
a
fact
of
daily
experience
i
have
explained
this
fear
by
the
fact
that
sexual
excitement
is
not
mastered
by
their
understanding
and
is
probably
also
inacceptable
to
them
because
their
parents
are
involved
in
it
for
the
same
son
this
excitement
is
converted
into
fear
at
a
still
earlier
period
of
life
sexual
emotion
directed
toward
the
parent
of
opposite
sex
does
not
meet
with
repression
but
finds
free
expression
as
we
have
seen
before
for
the
night
terrors
with
hallucinations
frequently
found
in
children
i
would
unhesitatingly
give
the
same
explanation
here
too
we
are
certainly
dealing
with
the
incomprehensible
and
rejected
sexual
feelings
which
if
noted
would
probably
show
a
temporal
periodicity
for
an
enhancement
of
the
sexual
may
just
as
well
be
produced
accidentally
through
emotional
impressions
as
through
the
spontaneous
and
gradual
processes
of
development
i
lack
the
necessary
material
to
sustain
these
explanations
from
observation
on
the
other
hand
the
pediatrists
seem
to
lack
the
point
of
view
which
alone
makes
comprehensible
the
whole
series
of
phenomena
on
the
somatic
as
well
as
on
the
psychic
side
to
illustrate
by
a
comical
example
how
one
wearing
the
blinders
of
medical
mythology
may
miss
the
understanding
of
such
cases
i
will
relate
a
case
which
i
found
in
a
thesis
on
by
a
boy
of
delicate
health
began
to
become
anxious
and
dreamy
his
sleep
became
restless
and
about
once
a
week
it
was
interrupted
by
an
acute
attack
of
anxiety
with
hallucinations
the
memory
of
these
dreams
was
invariably
very
distinct
thus
he
related
that
the
shouted
at
him
now
we
have
you
now
we
have
you
and
this
was
followed
by
an
odor
of
sulphur
the
fire
burned
his
skin
this
dream
aroused
him
he
was
unable
to
scream
at
first
then
his
voice
returned
and
he
was
heard
to
say
distinctly
no
no
not
me
why
i
have
done
nothing
or
please
do
i
shall
never
do
it
again
occasionally
also
he
said
albert
has
not
done
that
later
he
avoided
undressing
because
as
he
said
the
fire
attacked
him
only
when
he
was
undressed
from
amid
these
evil
dreams
which
menaced
his
health
he
was
sent
into
the
country
where
he
recovered
within
a
year
and
a
half
but
at
the
age
of
fifteen
he
once
confessed
je
pas
mais
continuellement
des
picotements
et
des
surexcitations
aux
à
la
fin
cela
tant
que
plusieurs
fois
pensé
me
jeter
par
la
fenêtre
au
dortoir
it
is
certainly
not
difficult
to
suspect
that
the
boy
had
practiced
masturbation
in
former
years
that
he
probably
denied
it
and
was
threatened
with
severe
punishment
for
his
wrongdoing
his
confession
je
ne
le
ferai
plus
his
denial
albert
jamais
fait
ça
that
under
the
pressure
of
puberty
the
temptation
to
through
the
tickling
of
the
genitals
was
reawakened
that
now
however
a
struggle
of
repression
arose
in
him
suppressing
the
and
changing
it
into
fear
which
subsequently
took
the
form
of
the
punishments
with
which
he
was
then
threatened
let
us
however
quote
the
conclusions
drawn
by
our
author
this
observation
shows
that
the
influence
of
puberty
may
produce
in
a
boy
of
delicate
health
a
condition
of
extreme
weakness
and
that
it
may
lead
to
a
marked
cerebral
this
cerebral
anæmia
produces
a
transformation
of
character
demonomaniacal
hallucinations
and
very
violent
nocturnal
perhaps
also
diurnal
states
of
anxiety
demonomania
and
the
of
the
day
can
be
traced
to
the
influences
of
religious
education
which
the
subject
underwent
as
a
child
all
manifestations
disappeared
as
a
result
of
a
lengthy
sojourn
in
the
country
bodily
exercise
and
the
return
of
physical
strength
after
the
termination
of
the
period
of
puberty
a
predisposing
influence
for
the
origin
of
the
cerebral
condition
of
the
boy
may
be
attributed
to
heredity
and
to
the
father
chronic
syphilitic
state
the
concluding
remarks
of
the
author
read

the
primary
and
secondary
process
regression
in
venturing
to
attempt
to
penetrate
more
deeply
into
the
psychology
of
the
dream
processes
i
have
undertaken
a
difficult
task
to
which
indeed
my
power
of
description
is
hardly
equal
to
reproduce
in
description
by
a
succession
of
words
the
simultaneousness
of
so
complex
a
chain
of
events
and
in
doing
so
to
appear
unbiassed
throughout
the
exposition
goes
fairly
beyond
my
powers
i
have
now
to
atone
for
the
fact
that
i
have
been
unable
in
my
description
of
the
dream
psychology
to
follow
the
historic
development
of
my
views
the
for
my
conception
of
the
dream
were
reached
through
earlier
investigations
in
the
psychology
of
the
neuroses
to
which
i
am
not
supposed
to
refer
here
but
to
which
i
am
repeatedly
forced
to
refer
whereas
i
should
prefer
to
proceed
in
the
opposite
direction
and
starting
from
the
dream
to
establish
a
connection
with
the
psychology
of
the
neuroses
i
am
well
aware
of
all
the
inconveniences
arising
for
the
reader
from
this
difficulty
but
i
know
of
no
way
to
avoid
them
as
i
am
dissatisfied
with
this
state
of
affairs
i
am
glad
to
dwell
upon
another
which
seems
to
raise
the
value
of
my
efforts
as
has
been
shown
in
the
introduction
to
the
first
chapter
i
found
myself
confronted
with
a
theme
which
had
been
marked
by
the
sharpest
contradictions
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
after
our
elaboration
of
the
dream
problems
we
found
room
for
most
of
these
contradictions
we
have
been
forced
however
to
take
decided
exception
to
two
of
the
views
pronounced
viz
that
the
dream
is
a
senseless
and
that
it
is
a
somatic
process
apart
from
these
cases
we
have
had
to
accept
all
the
contradictory
views
in
one
place
or
another
of
the
complicated
argument
and
we
have
been
able
to
demonstrate
that
they
had
discovered
something
that
was
correct
that
the
dream
continues
the
impulses
and
interests
of
the
waking
state
has
been
quite
generally
confirmed
through
the
discovery
of
the
latent
thoughts
of
the
dream
these
thoughts
concern
themselves
only
with
things
that
seem
important
and
of
momentous
interest
to
us
the
dream
never
occupies
itself
with
trifles
but
we
have
also
concurred
with
the
contrary
view
that
the
dream
gathers
up
the
indifferent
remnants
from
the
day
and
that
not
until
it
has
in
some
measure
withdrawn
itself
from
the
waking
activity
can
an
important
event
of
the
day
be
taken
up
by
the
dream
we
found
this
holding
true
for
the
dream
content
which
gives
the
dream
thought
its
changed
expression
by
means
of
disfigurement
we
have
said
that
from
the
nature
of
the
association
mechanism
the
dream
process
more
easily
takes
possession
of
recent
or
indifferent
material
which
has
not
yet
been
seized
by
the
waking
mental
activity
and
by
reason
of
the
censor
it
transfers
the
psychic
intensity
from
the
important
but
also
disagreeable
to
the
indifferent
material
the
hypermnesia
of
the
dream
and
the
resort
to
infantile
material
have
become
main
supports
in
our
theory
in
our
theory
of
the
dream
we
have
attributed
to
the
wish
originating
from
the
infantile
the
part
of
an
indispensable
motor
for
the
formation
of
the
dream
we
naturally
could
not
think
of
doubting
the
experimentally
demonstrated
significance
of
the
objective
sensory
stimuli
during
sleep
but
we
have
brought
this
material
into
the
same
relation
to
the
as
the
thought
remnants
from
the
waking
activity
there
was
no
need
of
disputing
the
fact
that
the
dream
interprets
the
objective
sensory
stimuli
after
the
manner
of
an
illusion
but
we
have
supplied
the
motive
for
this
interpretation
which
has
been
left
undecided
by
the
authorities
the
interpretation
follows
in
such
a
manner
that
the
perceived
object
is
rendered
harmless
as
a
sleep
disturber
and
becomes
available
for
the
though
we
do
not
admit
as
special
sources
of
the
dream
the
subjective
state
of
excitement
of
the
sensory
organs
during
sleep
which
seems
to
have
been
demonstrated
by
trumbull
ladd
we
are
nevertheless
able
to
explain
this
excitement
through
the
regressive
revival
of
active
memories
behind
the
dream
a
modest
part
in
our
conception
has
also
been
assigned
to
the
inner
organic
sensations
which
are
wont
to
be
taken
as
the
cardinal
point
in
the
explanation
of
the
dream
these
the
sensation
of
falling
flying
or
inhibition
stand
as
an
ever
ready
material
to
be
used
by
the
to
express
the
dream
thought
as
often
as
need
arises
that
the
dream
process
is
a
rapid
and
momentary
one
seems
to
be
true
for
the
perception
through
consciousness
of
the
already
prepared
dream
content
the
preceding
parts
of
the
dream
process
probably
take
a
slow
fluctuating
course
we
have
solved
the
riddle
of
the
superabundant
dream
content
compressed
within
the
briefest
moment
by
explaining
that
this
is
due
to
the
appropriation
of
almost
fully
formed
structures
from
the
psychic
life
that
the
dream
is
disfigured
and
distorted
by
memory
we
found
to
be
correct
but
not
troublesome
as
this
is
only
the
last
manifest
operation
in
the
work
of
disfigurement
which
has
been
active
from
the
beginning
of
the
in
the
bitter
and
seemingly
irreconcilable
controversy
as
to
whether
the
psychic
life
sleeps
at
night
or
can
make
the
same
use
of
all
its
capabilities
as
during
the
day
we
have
been
able
to
agree
with
both
sides
though
not
fully
with
either
we
have
found
proof
that
the
dream
thoughts
represent
a
most
complicated
intellectual
activity
employing
almost
every
means
furnished
by
the
psychic
apparatus
still
it
can
not
be
denied
that
these
dream
thoughts
have
originated
during
the
day
and
it
is
indispensable
to
assume
that
there
is
a
sleeping
state
of
the
psychic
life
thus
even
the
theory
of
partial
sleep
has
come
into
play
but
the
characteristics
of
the
sleeping
state
have
been
found
not
in
the
dilapidation
of
the
psychic
connections
but
in
the
cessation
of
the
psychic
system
dominating
the
day
arising
from
its
desire
to
sleep
the
withdrawal
from
the
outer
world
retains
its
significance
also
for
our
conception
though
not
the
only
factor
it
nevertheless
helps
the
regression
to
make
possible
the
representation
of
the
dream
that
we
should
reject
the
voluntary
guidance
of
the
presentation
course
is
uncontestable
but
the
psychic
life
does
not
thereby
become
aimless
for
we
have
seen
that
after
the
abandonment
of
the
desired
undesired
ones
gain
the
mastery
the
loose
associative
connection
in
the
dream
we
have
not
only
recognized
but
we
have
placed
under
its
control
a
far
greater
territory
than
could
have
been
supposed
we
have
however
found
it
merely
the
feigned
substitute
for
another
correct
and
senseful
one
to
be
sure
we
too
have
called
the
dream
absurd
but
we
have
been
able
to
learn
from
examples
how
wise
the
dream
really
is
when
it
simulates
absurdity
we
do
not
deny
any
of
the
functions
that
have
been
attributed
to
the
dream
that
the
dream
relieves
the
mind
like
a
valve
and
that
according
to
robert
assertion
all
kinds
of
harmful
material
are
rendered
harmless
through
representation
in
the
dream
not
only
exactly
coincides
with
our
theory
of
the
twofold
in
the
dream
but
in
his
own
wording
becomes
even
more
comprehensible
for
us
than
for
robert
himself
the
free
indulgence
of
the
psychic
in
the
play
of
its
faculties
finds
expression
with
us
in
the
with
the
dream
on
the
part
of
the
foreconscious
activity
the
return
to
the
embryonal
state
of
psychic
life
in
the
dream
and
the
observation
of
havelock
ellis
an
archaic
world
of
vast
emotions
and
imperfect
thoughts
appear
to
us
as
happy
anticipations
of
our
deductions
to
the
effect
that
modes
of
work
suppressed
during
the
day
participate
in
the
formation
of
the
dream
and
with
us
as
with
delage
the
material
becomes
the
mainspring
of
the
dreaming
we
have
fully
recognized
the
rôle
which
scherner
ascribes
to
the
dream
phantasy
and
even
his
interpretation
but
we
have
been
obliged
so
to
speak
to
conduct
them
to
another
department
in
the
problem
it
is
not
the
dream
that
produces
the
phantasy
but
the
unconscious
phantasy
that
takes
the
greatest
part
in
the
formation
of
the
dream
thoughts
we
are
indebted
to
scherner
for
his
clew
to
the
source
of
the
dream
thoughts
but
almost
everything
that
he
ascribes
to
the
is
attributable
to
the
activity
of
the
unconscious
which
is
at
work
during
the
day
and
which
supplies
incitements
not
only
for
dreams
but
for
neurotic
symptoms
as
well
we
have
had
to
separate
the
from
this
activity
as
being
something
entirely
different
and
far
more
restricted
finally
we
have
by
no
means
abandoned
the
relation
of
the
dream
to
mental
disturbances
but
on
the
contrary
we
have
given
it
a
more
solid
foundation
on
new
ground
thus
held
together
by
the
new
material
of
our
theory
as
by
a
superior
unity
we
find
the
most
varied
and
most
contradictory
conclusions
of
the
authorities
fitting
into
our
structure
some
of
them
are
differently
disposed
only
a
few
of
them
are
entirely
rejected
but
our
own
structure
is
still
unfinished
for
disregarding
the
many
obscurities
which
we
have
necessarily
encountered
in
our
advance
into
the
darkness
of
psychology
we
are
now
apparently
embarrassed
by
a
new
contradiction
on
the
one
hand
we
have
allowed
the
dream
thoughts
to
proceed
from
perfectly
normal
mental
operations
while
on
the
other
hand
we
have
found
among
the
dream
thoughts
a
number
of
entirely
abnormal
mental
processes
which
extend
likewise
to
the
dream
contents
these
consequently
we
have
repeated
in
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
all
that
we
have
termed
the
seems
so
remote
from
the
psychic
processes
recognized
by
us
as
correct
that
the
severest
judgments
of
the
authors
as
to
the
low
psychic
activity
of
dreaming
seem
to
us
well
founded
perhaps
only
through
still
further
advance
can
enlightenment
and
improvement
be
brought
about
i
shall
pick
out
one
of
the
constellations
leading
to
the
formation
of
dreams
we
have
learned
that
the
dream
replaces
a
number
of
thoughts
derived
from
daily
life
which
are
perfectly
formed
logically
we
can
not
therefore
doubt
that
these
thoughts
originate
from
our
normal
mental
life
all
the
qualities
which
we
esteem
in
our
mental
operations
and
which
distinguish
these
as
complicated
activities
of
a
high
order
we
find
repeated
in
the
dream
thoughts
there
is
however
no
need
of
assuming
that
this
mental
work
is
performed
during
sleep
as
this
would
materially
impair
the
conception
of
the
psychic
state
of
sleep
we
have
hitherto
adhered
to
these
thoughts
may
just
as
well
have
originated
from
the
day
and
unnoticed
by
our
consciousness
from
their
inception
they
may
have
continued
to
develop
until
they
stood
complete
at
the
onset
of
sleep
if
we
are
to
conclude
anything
from
this
state
of
affairs
it
will
at
most
prove
the
most
complex
mental
operations
are
possible
without
the
coöperation
of
which
we
have
already
learned
independently
from
every
psychoanalysis
of
persons
suffering
from
hysteria
or
obsessions
these
dream
thoughts
are
in
themselves
surely
not
incapable
of
consciousness
if
they
have
not
become
conscious
to
us
during
the
day
this
may
have
various
reasons
the
state
of
becoming
conscious
depends
on
the
exercise
of
a
certain
psychic
function
viz
attention
which
seems
to
be
extended
only
in
a
definite
quantity
and
which
may
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
stream
of
thought
in
question
by
other
aims
another
way
in
which
such
mental
streams
are
kept
from
consciousness
is
the
following
our
conscious
reflection
teaches
us
that
when
exercising
attention
we
pursue
a
definite
course
but
if
that
course
leads
us
to
an
idea
which
does
not
hold
its
own
with
the
critic
we
discontinue
and
cease
to
apply
our
attention
now
apparently
the
stream
of
thought
thus
started
and
abandoned
may
spin
on
without
regaining
attention
unless
it
reaches
a
spot
of
especially
marked
intensity
which
forces
the
return
of
attention
an
initial
rejection
perhaps
consciously
brought
about
by
the
judgment
on
the
ground
of
incorrectness
or
unfitness
for
the
actual
purpose
of
the
mental
act
may
therefore
account
for
the
fact
that
a
mental
process
continues
until
the
onset
of
sleep
unnoticed
by
consciousness
let
us
recapitulate
by
saying
that
we
call
such
a
stream
of
thought
a
foreconscious
one
that
we
believe
it
to
be
perfectly
correct
and
that
it
may
just
as
well
be
a
more
neglected
one
or
an
interrupted
and
suppressed
one
let
us
also
state
frankly
in
what
manner
we
conceive
this
presentation
course
we
believe
that
a
certain
sum
of
excitement
which
we
call
occupation
energy
is
displaced
from
an
along
the
association
paths
selected
by
that
a
neglected
stream
of
thought
has
received
no
such
occupation
and
from
a
suppressed
or
rejected
one
this
occupation
has
been
withdrawn
both
have
thus
been
left
to
their
own
emotions
the
of
thought
stocked
with
energy
is
under
certain
conditions
able
to
draw
to
itself
the
attention
of
consciousness
through
which
means
it
then
receives
a
surplus
of
energy
we
shall
be
obliged
somewhat
later
to
elucidate
our
assumption
concerning
the
nature
and
activity
of
consciousness
a
train
of
thought
thus
incited
in
the
forec
may
either
disappear
spontaneously
or
continue
the
former
issue
we
conceive
as
follows
it
diffuses
its
energy
through
all
the
association
paths
emanating
from
it
and
throws
the
entire
chain
of
ideas
into
a
state
of
excitement
which
after
lasting
for
a
while
subsides
through
the
transformation
of
the
excitement
requiring
an
outlet
into
dormant
energy
if
this
first
issue
is
brought
about
the
process
has
no
further
significance
for
the
dream
formation
but
other
are
lurking
in
our
foreconscious
that
originate
from
the
sources
of
our
unconscious
and
from
the
ever
active
wishes
these
may
take
possession
of
the
excitations
in
the
circle
of
thought
thus
left
to
itself
establish
a
connection
between
it
and
the
unconscious
wish
and
transfer
to
it
the
energy
inherent
in
the
unconscious
wish
henceforth
the
neglected
or
suppressed
train
of
thought
is
in
a
position
to
maintain
itself
although
this
reinforcement
does
not
help
it
to
gain
access
to
consciousness
we
may
say
that
the
hitherto
foreconscious
train
of
thought
has
been
drawn
into
the
unconscious
other
constellations
for
the
dream
formation
would
result
if
the
foreconscious
train
of
thought
had
from
the
beginning
been
connected
with
the
unconscious
wish
and
for
that
reason
met
with
rejection
by
the
dominating
or
if
an
unconscious
wish
were
made
active
for
other
possibly
somatic
reasons
and
of
its
own
accord
sought
a
transference
to
the
psychic
remnants
not
occupied
by
the
forec
all
three
cases
finally
combine
in
one
issue
so
that
there
is
established
in
the
foreconscious
a
stream
of
thought
which
having
been
abandoned
by
the
foreconscious
occupation
receives
occupation
from
the
unconscious
wish
the
stream
of
thought
is
henceforth
subjected
to
a
series
of
transformations
which
we
no
longer
recognize
as
normal
psychic
processes
and
which
give
us
a
surprising
result
viz
a
psychopathological
formation
let
us
emphasize
and
group
the
same
the
intensities
of
the
individual
ideas
become
capable
of
discharge
in
their
entirety
and
proceeding
from
one
conception
to
the
other
they
thus
form
single
presentations
endowed
with
marked
intensity
through
the
repeated
recurrence
of
this
process
the
intensity
of
an
entire
train
of
ideas
may
ultimately
be
gathered
in
a
single
presentation
element
this
is
the
principle
of
or
it
is
condensation
that
is
mainly
responsible
for
the
strange
impression
of
the
dream
for
we
know
of
nothing
analogous
to
it
in
the
normal
psychic
life
accessible
to
consciousness
we
find
here
also
presentations
which
possess
great
psychic
significance
as
junctions
or
as
of
whole
chains
of
thought
but
this
validity
does
not
manifest
itself
in
any
character
conspicuous
enough
for
internal
perception
hence
what
has
been
presented
in
it
does
not
become
in
any
way
more
intensive
in
the
process
of
condensation
the
entire
psychic
connection
becomes
transformed
into
the
intensity
of
the
presentation
content
it
is
the
same
as
in
a
book
where
we
space
or
print
in
heavy
type
any
word
upon
which
particular
stress
is
laid
for
the
understanding
of
the
text
in
speech
the
same
word
would
be
pronounced
loudly
and
deliberately
and
with
emphasis
the
first
comparison
leads
us
at
once
to
an
example
taken
from
the
chapter
on
the
trimethylamine
in
the
dream
of
irma
injection
historians
of
art
call
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
most
ancient
historical
sculptures
follow
a
similar
principle
in
expressing
the
rank
of
the
persons
represented
by
the
size
of
the
statue
the
king
is
made
two
or
three
times
as
large
as
his
retinue
or
the
vanquished
enemy
a
piece
of
art
however
from
the
roman
period
makes
use
of
more
subtle
means
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
the
figure
of
the
emperor
is
placed
in
the
center
in
a
firmly
erect
posture
special
care
is
bestowed
on
the
proper
modelling
of
his
figure
his
enemies
are
seen
cowering
at
his
feet
but
he
is
no
longer
represented
a
giant
among
dwarfs
however
the
bowing
of
the
subordinate
to
his
superior
in
our
own
days
is
only
an
echo
of
that
ancient
principle
of
representation
the
direction
taken
by
the
condensations
of
the
dream
is
prescribed
on
the
one
hand
by
the
true
foreconscious
relations
of
the
dream
thoughts
an
the
other
hand
by
the
attraction
of
the
visual
reminiscences
in
the
unconscious
the
success
of
the
condensation
work
produces
those
intensities
which
are
required
for
penetration
into
the
perception
systems
through
this
free
transferability
of
the
intensities
moreover
and
in
the
service
of
condensation
compromises
as
it
were
are
formed
the
numerous
examples
this
likewise
is
something
unheard
of
in
the
normal
presentation
course
where
it
is
above
all
a
question
of
selection
and
retention
of
the
proper
presentation
element
on
the
other
hand
composite
and
compromise
formations
occur
with
extraordinary
frequency
when
we
are
trying
to
find
the
linguistic
expression
for
foreconscious
thoughts
these
are
considered
slips
of
the
tongue
the
presentations
which
transfer
their
intensities
to
one
another
are
loosely
and
are
joined
together
by
such
forms
of
association
as
are
spurned
in
our
serious
thought
and
are
utilized
in
the
production
of
the
effect
of
wit
only
among
these
we
particularly
find
associations
of
the
sound
and
consonance
types
contradictory
thoughts
do
not
strive
to
eliminate
one
another
but
remain
side
by
side
they
often
unite
to
produce
condensation
if
no
existed
or
they
form
compromises
for
which
we
should
never
forgive
our
thoughts
but
which
we
frequently
approve
of
in
our
actions
these
are
some
of
the
most
conspicuous
abnormal
processes
to
which
the
thoughts
which
have
previously
been
rationally
formed
are
subjected
in
the
course
of
the
as
the
main
feature
of
these
processes
we
recognize
the
high
importance
attached
to
the
fact
of
rendering
the
occupation
energy
mobile
and
capable
of
discharge
the
content
and
the
actual
significance
of
the
psychic
elements
to
which
these
energies
adhere
become
a
matter
of
secondary
importance
one
might
possibly
think
that
the
condensation
and
compromise
formation
is
effected
only
in
the
service
of
regression
when
occasion
arises
for
changing
thoughts
into
pictures
but
the
analysis
and
still
more
distinctly
the
synthesis
of
dreams
which
lack
regression
toward
pictures
the
dream
autodidasker
conversation
with
present
the
same
processes
of
displacement
and
condensation
as
the
others
hence
we
can
not
refuse
to
acknowledge
that
the
two
kinds
of
essentially
different
psychic
processes
participate
in
the
formation
of
the
dream
one
forms
perfectly
correct
dream
thoughts
which
are
equivalent
to
normal
thoughts
while
the
other
treats
these
ideas
in
a
highly
surprising
and
incorrect
manner
the
latter
process
we
have
already
set
apart
as
the
proper
what
have
we
now
to
advance
concerning
this
latter
psychic
process
we
should
be
unable
to
answer
this
question
here
if
we
had
not
penetrated
considerably
into
the
psychology
of
the
neuroses
and
especially
of
hysteria
from
this
we
learn
that
the
same
incorrect
psychic
processes
as
well
as
others
that
have
not
been
enumerated
control
the
formation
of
hysterical
symptoms
in
hysteria
too
we
at
once
find
a
series
of
perfectly
correct
thoughts
equivalent
to
our
conscious
thoughts
of
whose
existence
however
in
this
form
we
can
learn
nothing
and
which
we
can
only
subsequently
reconstruct
if
they
have
forced
their
way
anywhere
to
our
perception
we
discover
from
the
analysis
of
the
symptom
formed
that
these
normal
thoughts
have
been
subjected
to
abnormal
treatment
and
been
transformed
into
the
symptom
by
means
of
condensation
and
compromise
formation
through
superficial
associations
under
cover
of
contradictions
and
eventually
over
the
road
of
in
view
of
the
complete
identity
found
between
the
peculiarities
of
the
and
of
the
psychic
activity
forming
the
psychoneurotic
symptoms
we
shall
feel
justified
in
transferring
to
the
dream
the
conclusions
urged
upon
us
by
hysteria
from
the
theory
of
hysteria
we
borrow
the
proposition
that
an
abnormal
psychic
elaboration
of
a
normal
train
of
thought
takes
place
only
when
the
latter
has
been
used
for
the
transference
of
an
unconscious
wish
which
dates
from
the
infantile
life
and
is
in
a
state
of
in
accordance
with
this
proposition
we
have
construed
the
theory
of
the
dream
on
the
assumption
that
the
actuating
invariably
originates
in
the
unconscious
which
as
we
ourselves
have
admitted
can
not
be
universally
demonstrated
though
it
can
not
be
refuted
but
in
order
to
explain
the
real
meaning
of
the
term
which
we
have
employed
so
freely
we
shall
be
obliged
to
make
some
further
addition
to
our
psychological
construction
we
have
above
elaborated
the
fiction
of
a
primitive
psychic
apparatus
whose
work
is
regulated
by
the
efforts
to
avoid
accumulation
of
excitement
and
as
far
as
possible
to
maintain
itself
free
from
excitement
for
this
reason
it
was
constructed
after
the
plan
of
a
reflex
apparatus
the
motility
originally
the
path
for
the
inner
bodily
change
formed
a
discharging
path
standing
at
its
disposal
we
subsequently
discussed
the
psychic
results
of
a
feeling
of
gratification
and
we
might
at
the
same
time
have
introduced
the
second
assumption
viz
that
accumulation
of
excitement
following
certain
modalities
that
do
not
concern
us
is
perceived
as
pain
and
sets
the
apparatus
in
motion
in
order
to
reproduce
a
feeling
of
gratification
in
which
the
diminution
of
the
excitement
is
perceived
as
pleasure
such
a
current
in
the
apparatus
which
emanates
from
pain
and
strives
for
pleasure
we
call
a
wish
we
have
said
that
nothing
but
a
wish
is
capable
of
setting
the
apparatus
in
motion
and
that
the
discharge
of
excitement
in
the
apparatus
is
regulated
automatically
by
the
perception
of
pleasure
and
pain
the
first
wish
must
have
been
an
hallucinatory
occupation
of
the
memory
for
gratification
but
this
hallucination
unless
it
were
maintained
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
proved
incapable
of
bringing
about
a
cessation
of
the
desire
and
consequently
of
securing
the
pleasure
connected
with
gratification
thus
there
was
required
a
second
activity
in
our
terminology
the
activity
of
a
second
system
which
should
not
permit
the
memory
occupation
to
advance
to
perception
and
therefrom
to
restrict
the
psychic
forces
but
should
lead
the
excitement
emanating
from
the
craving
stimulus
by
a
devious
path
over
the
spontaneous
motility
which
ultimately
should
so
change
the
outer
world
as
to
allow
the
real
perception
of
the
object
of
gratification
to
take
place
thus
far
we
have
elaborated
the
plan
of
the
psychic
apparatus
these
two
systems
are
the
germ
of
the
unc
and
forec
which
we
include
in
the
fully
developed
apparatus
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
successfully
to
change
the
outer
world
through
the
motility
there
is
required
the
accumulation
of
a
large
sum
of
experiences
in
the
memory
systems
as
well
as
a
manifold
fixation
of
the
relations
which
are
evoked
in
this
memory
material
by
different
we
now
proceed
further
with
our
assumption
the
manifold
activity
of
the
second
system
tentatively
sending
forth
and
retracting
energy
must
on
the
one
hand
have
full
command
over
all
memory
material
but
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
a
superfluous
expenditure
for
it
to
send
to
the
individual
mental
paths
large
quantities
of
energy
which
would
thus
flow
off
to
no
purpose
diminishing
the
quantity
available
for
the
transformation
of
the
outer
world
in
the
interests
of
expediency
i
therefore
postulate
that
the
second
system
succeeds
in
maintaining
the
greater
part
of
the
occupation
energy
in
a
dormant
state
and
in
using
but
a
small
portion
for
the
purposes
of
displacement
the
mechanism
of
these
processes
is
entirely
unknown
to
me
any
one
who
wishes
to
follow
up
these
ideas
must
try
to
find
the
physical
analogies
and
prepare
the
way
for
a
demonstration
of
the
process
of
motion
in
the
stimulation
of
the
neuron
i
merely
hold
to
the
idea
that
the
activity
of
the
first
greek
psi
is
directed
the
free
outflow
of
the
quantities
of
and
that
the
second
system
brings
about
an
inhibition
of
this
outflow
through
the
energies
emanating
from
it
it
produces
a
into
dormant
energy
probably
by
raising
the
i
therefore
assume
that
under
the
control
of
the
second
system
as
compared
with
the
first
the
course
of
the
excitement
is
bound
to
entirely
different
mechanical
conditions
after
the
second
system
has
finished
its
tentative
mental
work
it
removes
the
inhibition
and
congestion
of
the
excitements
and
allows
these
excitements
to
flow
off
to
the
motility
an
interesting
train
of
thought
now
presents
itself
if
we
consider
the
relations
of
this
inhibition
of
discharge
by
the
second
system
to
the
regulation
through
the
principle
of
pain
let
us
now
seek
the
counterpart
of
the
primary
feeling
of
gratification
namely
the
objective
feeling
of
fear
a
perceptive
stimulus
acts
on
the
primitive
apparatus
becoming
the
source
of
a
painful
emotion
this
will
then
be
followed
by
irregular
motor
manifestations
until
one
of
these
withdraws
the
apparatus
from
perception
and
at
the
same
time
from
pain
but
on
the
reappearance
of
the
perception
this
manifestation
will
immediately
repeat
itself
perhaps
as
a
movement
of
flight
until
the
perception
has
again
disappeared
but
there
will
here
remain
no
tendency
again
to
occupy
the
perception
of
the
source
of
pain
in
the
form
of
an
hallucination
or
in
any
other
form
on
the
contrary
there
will
be
a
tendency
in
the
primary
apparatus
to
abandon
the
painful
memory
picture
as
soon
as
it
is
in
any
way
awakened
as
the
overflow
of
its
excitement
would
surely
produce
more
precisely
begin
to
produce
pain
the
deviation
from
memory
which
is
but
a
repetition
of
the
former
flight
from
perception
is
facilitated
also
by
the
fact
that
unlike
perception
memory
does
not
possess
sufficient
quality
to
excite
consciousness
and
thereby
to
attract
to
itself
new
energy
this
easy
and
regularly
occurring
deviation
of
the
psychic
process
from
the
former
painful
memory
presents
to
us
the
model
and
the
first
example
of
as
is
generally
known
much
of
this
deviation
from
the
painful
much
of
the
behavior
of
the
ostrich
can
be
readily
demonstrated
even
in
the
normal
psychic
life
of
adults
by
virtue
of
the
principle
of
pain
the
first
system
is
therefore
altogether
incapable
of
introducing
anything
unpleasant
into
the
mental
associations
the
system
can
not
do
anything
but
wish
if
this
remained
so
the
mental
activity
of
the
second
system
which
should
have
at
its
disposal
all
the
memories
stored
up
by
experiences
would
be
hindered
but
two
ways
are
now
opened
the
work
of
the
second
system
either
frees
itself
completely
from
the
principle
of
pain
and
continues
its
course
paying
no
heed
to
the
painful
reminiscence
or
it
contrives
to
occupy
the
painful
memory
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preclude
the
liberation
of
pain
we
may
reject
the
first
possibility
as
the
principle
of
pain
also
manifests
itself
as
a
regulator
for
the
emotional
discharge
of
the
second
system
we
are
therefore
directed
to
the
second
possibility
namely
that
this
system
occupies
a
reminiscence
in
such
a
manner
as
to
inhibit
its
discharge
and
hence
also
to
inhibit
the
discharge
comparable
to
a
motor
innervation
for
the
development
of
pain
thus
from
two
starting
points
we
are
led
to
the
hypothesis
that
occupation
through
the
second
system
is
at
the
same
time
an
inhibition
for
the
emotional
discharge
viz
from
a
consideration
of
the
principle
of
pain
and
from
the
principle
of
the
smallest
expenditure
of
innervation
let
us
however
keep
to
the
fact
this
is
the
key
to
the
theory
of
repression
that
the
second
system
is
capable
of
occupying
an
idea
only
when
it
is
in
position
to
check
the
development
of
pain
emanating
from
it
whatever
withdraws
itself
from
this
inhibition
also
remains
inaccessible
for
the
second
system
and
would
soon
be
abandoned
by
virtue
of
the
principle
of
pain
the
inhibition
of
pain
however
need
not
be
complete
it
must
be
permitted
to
begin
as
it
indicates
to
the
second
system
the
nature
of
the
memory
and
possibly
its
defective
adaptation
for
the
purpose
sought
by
the
mind
the
psychic
process
which
is
admitted
by
the
first
system
only
i
shall
now
call
the
process
and
the
one
resulting
from
the
inhibition
of
the
second
system
i
shall
call
the
process
i
show
by
another
point
for
what
purpose
the
second
system
is
obliged
to
correct
the
primary
process
the
primary
process
strives
for
a
discharge
of
the
excitement
in
order
to
establish
a
identity
with
the
sum
of
excitement
thus
gathered
the
secondary
process
has
abandoned
this
intention
and
undertaken
instead
the
task
of
bringing
about
a
all
thinking
is
only
a
circuitous
path
from
the
memory
of
gratification
taken
as
an
to
the
identical
occupation
of
the
same
memory
which
is
again
to
be
attained
on
the
track
of
the
motor
experiences
the
state
of
thinking
must
take
an
interest
in
the
connecting
paths
between
the
presentations
without
allowing
itself
to
be
misled
by
their
intensities
but
it
is
obvious
that
condensations
and
intermediate
or
compromise
formations
occurring
in
the
presentations
impede
the
attainment
of
this
by
substituting
one
idea
for
the
other
they
deviate
from
the
path
which
otherwise
would
have
been
continued
from
the
original
idea
such
processes
are
therefore
carefully
avoided
in
the
secondary
thinking
nor
is
it
difficult
to
understand
that
the
principle
of
pain
also
impedes
the
progress
of
the
mental
stream
in
its
pursuit
of
the
thought
identity
though
indeed
it
offers
to
the
mental
stream
the
most
important
points
of
departure
hence
the
tendency
of
the
thinking
process
must
be
to
free
itself
more
and
more
from
exclusive
adjustment
by
the
principle
of
pain
and
through
the
working
of
the
mind
to
restrict
the
affective
development
to
that
minimum
which
is
necessary
as
a
signal
this
refinement
of
the
activity
must
have
been
attained
through
a
recent
of
energy
brought
about
by
consciousness
but
we
are
aware
that
this
refinement
is
seldom
completely
successful
even
in
the
most
normal
psychic
life
and
that
our
thoughts
ever
remain
accessible
to
falsification
through
the
interference
of
the
principle
of
pain
this
however
is
not
the
breach
in
the
functional
efficiency
of
our
psychic
apparatus
through
which
the
thoughts
forming
the
material
of
the
secondary
mental
work
are
enabled
to
make
their
way
into
the
primary
psychic
process
with
which
formula
we
may
now
describe
the
work
leading
to
the
dream
and
to
the
hysterical
symptoms
this
case
of
insufficiency
results
from
the
union
of
the
two
factors
from
the
history
of
our
evolution
one
of
which
belongs
solely
to
the
psychic
apparatus
and
has
exerted
a
determining
influence
on
the
relation
of
the
two
systems
while
the
other
operates
fluctuatingly
and
introduces
motive
forces
of
organic
origin
into
the
psychic
life
both
originate
in
the
infantile
life
and
result
from
the
transformation
which
our
psychic
and
somatic
organism
has
undergone
since
the
infantile
period
when
i
termed
one
of
the
psychic
processes
in
the
psychic
apparatus
the
primary
process
i
did
so
not
only
in
consideration
of
the
order
of
precedence
and
capability
but
also
as
admitting
the
temporal
relations
to
a
share
in
the
nomenclature
as
far
as
our
knowledge
goes
there
is
no
psychic
apparatus
possessing
only
the
primary
process
and
in
so
far
it
is
a
theoretic
fiction
but
so
much
is
based
on
fact
that
the
primary
processes
are
present
in
the
apparatus
from
the
beginning
while
the
secondary
processes
develop
gradually
in
the
course
of
life
inhibiting
and
covering
the
primary
ones
and
gaining
complete
mastery
over
them
perhaps
only
at
the
height
of
life
owing
to
this
retarded
appearance
of
the
secondary
processes
the
essence
of
our
being
consisting
in
unconscious
wish
feelings
can
neither
be
seized
nor
inhibited
by
the
foreconscious
whose
part
is
once
for
all
restricted
to
the
indication
of
the
most
suitable
paths
for
the
wish
feelings
originating
in
the
unconscious
these
unconscious
wishes
establish
for
all
subsequent
psychic
efforts
a
compulsion
to
which
they
have
to
submit
and
which
they
must
strive
if
possible
to
divert
from
its
course
and
direct
to
higher
aims
in
consequence
of
this
retardation
of
the
foreconscious
occupation
a
large
sphere
of
the
memory
material
remains
inaccessible
among
these
indestructible
and
unincumbered
wish
feelings
originating
from
the
infantile
life
there
are
also
some
the
fulfillments
of
which
have
entered
into
a
relation
of
contradiction
to
the
of
the
secondary
thinking
the
fulfillment
of
these
wishes
would
no
longer
produce
an
affect
of
pleasure
but
one
of
pain
it
is
just
this
transformation
of
affect
that
constitutes
the
nature
of
what
we
designate
as
repression
in
which
we
recognize
the
infantile
first
step
of
passing
adverse
sentence
or
of
rejecting
through
to
investigate
in
what
way
and
through
what
motive
forces
such
a
transformation
can
be
produced
constitutes
the
problem
of
repression
which
we
need
here
only
skim
over
it
will
suffice
to
remark
that
such
a
transformation
of
affect
occurs
in
the
course
of
development
one
may
think
of
the
appearance
in
infantile
life
of
disgust
which
was
originally
absent
and
that
it
is
connected
with
the
activity
of
the
secondary
system
the
memories
from
which
the
unconscious
wish
brings
about
the
emotional
discharge
have
never
been
accessible
to
the
and
for
that
reason
their
emotional
discharge
can
not
be
inhibited
it
is
just
on
account
of
this
affective
development
that
these
ideas
are
not
even
now
accessible
to
the
foreconscious
thoughts
to
which
they
have
transferred
their
wishing
power
on
the
contrary
the
principle
of
pain
comes
into
play
and
causes
the
forec
to
deviate
from
these
thoughts
of
transference
the
latter
left
to
themselves
are
repressed
and
thus
the
existence
of
a
store
of
infantile
memories
from
the
very
beginning
withdrawn
from
the
becomes
the
preliminary
condition
of
repression
in
the
most
favorable
case
the
development
of
pain
terminates
as
soon
as
the
energy
has
been
withdrawn
from
the
thoughts
of
transference
in
the
and
this
effect
characterizes
the
intervention
of
the
principle
of
pain
as
expedient
it
is
different
however
if
the
repressed
unconscious
wish
receives
an
organic
enforcement
which
it
can
lend
to
its
thoughts
of
transference
and
through
which
it
can
enable
them
to
make
an
effort
towards
penetration
with
their
excitement
even
after
they
have
been
abandoned
by
the
occupation
of
the
forec
a
defensive
struggle
then
ensues
inasmuch
as
the
forec
reinforces
the
antagonism
against
the
repressed
ideas
and
subsequently
this
leads
to
a
penetration
by
the
thoughts
of
transference
the
carriers
of
the
unconscious
wish
in
some
form
of
compromise
through
symptom
formation
but
from
the
moment
that
the
suppressed
thoughts
are
powerfully
occupied
by
the
unconscious
and
abandoned
by
the
foreconscious
occupation
they
succumb
to
the
primary
psychic
process
and
strive
only
for
motor
discharge
or
if
the
path
be
free
for
hallucinatory
revival
of
the
desired
perception
identity
we
have
previously
found
empirically
that
the
incorrect
processes
described
are
enacted
only
with
thoughts
that
exist
in
the
repression
we
now
grasp
another
part
of
the
connection
these
incorrect
processes
are
those
that
are
primary
in
the
psychic
apparatus
appear
wherever
thoughts
abandoned
by
the
foreconscious
occupation
are
left
to
themselves
and
can
fill
themselves
with
the
uninhibited
energy
striving
for
discharge
from
the
we
may
add
a
few
further
observations
to
support
the
view
that
these
processes
designated
incorrect
are
really
not
falsifications
of
the
normal
defective
thinking
but
the
modes
of
activity
of
the
psychic
apparatus
when
freed
from
inhibition
thus
we
see
that
the
transference
of
the
foreconscious
excitement
to
the
motility
takes
place
according
to
the
same
processes
and
that
the
connection
of
the
foreconscious
presentations
with
words
readily
manifest
the
same
displacements
and
mixtures
which
are
ascribed
to
inattention
finally
i
should
like
to
adduce
proof
that
an
increase
of
work
necessarily
results
from
the
inhibition
of
these
primary
courses
from
the
fact
that
we
gain
a
a
surplus
to
be
discharged
through
laughter
we
allow
these
streams
of
thought
to
come
to
the
theory
of
the
psychoneuroses
asserts
with
complete
certainty
that
only
sexual
from
the
infantile
life
experience
repression
emotional
transformation
during
the
developmental
period
of
childhood
these
are
capable
of
returning
to
activity
at
a
later
period
of
development
and
then
have
the
faculty
of
being
revived
either
as
a
consequence
of
the
sexual
constitution
which
is
really
formed
from
the
original
bisexuality
or
in
consequence
of
unfavorable
influences
of
the
sexual
life
and
they
thus
supply
the
motive
power
for
all
psychoneurotic
symptom
formations
it
is
only
by
the
introduction
of
these
sexual
forces
that
the
gaps
still
demonstrable
in
the
theory
of
repression
can
be
filled
i
will
leave
it
undecided
whether
the
postulate
of
the
sexual
and
infantile
may
also
be
asserted
for
the
theory
of
the
dream
i
leave
this
here
unfinished
because
i
have
already
passed
a
step
beyond
the
demonstrable
in
assuming
that
the
invariably
originates
from
the
unconscious
nor
will
i
further
investigate
the
difference
in
the
play
of
the
psychic
forces
in
the
dream
formation
and
in
the
formation
of
the
hysterical
symptoms
for
to
do
this
we
ought
to
possess
a
more
explicit
knowledge
of
one
of
the
members
to
be
compared
but
i
regard
another
point
as
important
and
will
here
confess
that
it
was
on
account
of
this
very
point
that
i
have
just
undertaken
this
entire
discussion
concerning
the
two
psychic
systems
their
modes
of
operation
and
the
repression
for
it
is
now
immaterial
whether
i
have
conceived
the
psychological
relations
in
question
with
approximate
correctness
or
as
is
easily
possible
in
such
a
difficult
matter
in
an
erroneous
and
fragmentary
manner
whatever
changes
may
be
made
in
the
interpretation
of
the
psychic
censor
and
of
the
correct
and
of
the
abnormal
elaboration
of
the
dream
content
the
fact
nevertheless
remains
that
such
processes
are
active
in
dream
formation
and
that
essentially
they
show
the
closest
analogy
to
the
processes
observed
in
the
formation
of
the
hysterical
symptoms
the
dream
is
not
a
pathological
phenomenon
and
it
does
not
leave
behind
an
enfeeblement
of
the
mental
faculties
the
objection
that
no
deduction
can
be
drawn
regarding
the
dreams
of
healthy
persons
from
my
own
dreams
and
from
those
of
neurotic
patients
may
be
rejected
without
comment
hence
when
we
draw
conclusions
from
the
phenomena
as
to
their
motive
forces
we
recognize
that
the
psychic
mechanism
made
use
of
by
the
neuroses
is
not
created
by
a
morbid
disturbance
of
the
psychic
life
but
is
found
ready
in
the
normal
structure
of
the
psychic
apparatus
the
two
psychic
systems
the
censor
crossing
between
them
the
inhibition
and
the
covering
of
the
one
activity
by
the
other
the
relations
of
both
to
consciousness
or
whatever
may
offer
a
more
correct
interpretation
of
the
actual
conditions
in
their
stead
all
these
belong
to
the
normal
structure
of
our
psychic
instrument
and
the
dream
points
out
for
us
one
of
the
roads
leading
to
a
knowledge
of
this
structure
if
in
addition
to
our
knowledge
we
wish
to
be
contented
with
a
minimum
perfectly
established
we
shall
say
that
the
dream
gives
us
proof
that
the
material
continues
to
exist
even
in
the
normal
person
and
remains
capable
of
psychic
the
dream
itself
is
one
of
the
manifestations
of
this
suppressed
material
theoretically
this
is
true
in
cases
according
to
substantial
experience
it
is
true
in
at
least
a
great
number
of
such
as
most
conspicuously
display
the
prominent
characteristics
of
dream
life
the
suppressed
psychic
material
which
in
the
waking
state
has
been
prevented
from
expression
and
cut
off
from
internal
perception
the
antagonistic
adjustment
of
the
finds
ways
and
means
of
obtruding
itself
on
consciousness
during
the
night
under
the
domination
of
the
compromise
formations
flectere
si
nequeo

movebo
at
any
rate
the
interpretation
of
dreams
is
the
to
a
knowledge
of
the
unconscious
in
the
psychic
life
in
following
the
analysis
of
the
dream
we
have
made
some
progress
toward
an
understanding
of
the
composition
of
this
most
marvelous
and
most
mysterious
of
instruments
to
be
sure
we
have
not
gone
very
far
but
enough
of
a
beginning
has
been
made
to
allow
us
to
advance
from
other
pathological
formations
further
into
the
analysis
of
the
unconscious
disease
at
least
that
which
is
justly
termed
functional
is
not
due
to
the
destruction
of
this
apparatus
and
the
establishment
of
new
splittings
in
its
interior
it
is
rather
to
be
explained
dynamically
through
the
strengthening
and
weakening
of
the
components
in
the
play
of
forces
by
which
so
many
activities
are
concealed
during
the
normal
function
we
have
been
able
to
show
in
another
place
how
the
composition
of
the
apparatus
from
the
two
systems
permits
a
subtilization
even
of
the
normal
activity
which
would
be
impossible
for
a
single
system
the
significant
observations
by
bueuer
in
our
on
and
ed
here
as
in
other
places
there
are
gaps
in
the
treatment
of
the
subject
which
i
have
left
intentionally
because
to
fill
them
up
would
require
on
the
one
hand
too
great
effort
and
on
the
other
hand
an
extensive
reference
to
material
that
is
foreign
to
the
dream
thus
i
have
avoided
stating
whether
i
connect
with
the
word
suppressed
another
sense
than
with
the
word
repressed
it
has
been
made
clear
only
that
the
latter
emphasizes
more
than
the
former
the
relation
to
the
unconscious
i
have
not
entered
into
the
cognate
problem
why
the
dream
thoughts
also
experience
distortion
by
the
censor
when
they
abandon
the
progressive
continuation
to
consciousness
and
choose
the
path
of
regression
i
have
been
above
all
anxious
to
awaken
an
interest
in
the
problems
to
which
the
further
analysis
of
the
dreamwork
leads
and
to
indicate
the
other
themes
which
meet
these
on
the
way
it
was
not
always
easy
to
decide
just
where
the
pursuit
should
be
discontinued
that
i
have
not
treated
exhaustively
the
part
played
in
the
dream
by
the
psychosexual
life
and
have
avoided
the
interpretation
of
dreams
of
an
obvious
sexual
content
is
due
to
a
special
reason
which
may
not
come
up
to
the
reader
expectation
to
be
sure
it
is
very
far
from
my
ideas
and
the
principles
expressed
by
me
in
neuropathology
to
regard
the
sexual
life
as
a
pudendum
which
should
be
left
unconsidered
by
the
physician
and
the
scientific
investigator
i
also
consider
ludicrous
the
moral
indignation
which
prompted
the
translator
of
artemidoros
of
daldis
to
keep
from
the
reader
knowledge
the
chapter
on
sexual
dreams
contained
in
the
of
the
as
for
myself
i
have
been
actuated
solely
by
the
conviction
that
in
the
explanation
of
sexual
dreams
i
should
be
bound
to
entangle
myself
deeply
in
the
still
unexplained
problems
of
perversion
and
bisexuality
and
for
that
reason
i
have
reserved
this
material
for
another
connection
ix
the
unconscious
and
consciousness
reality
on
closer
inspection
we
find
that
it
is
not
the
existence
of
two
systems
near
the
motor
end
of
the
apparatus
but
of
two
kinds
of
processes
or
modes
of
emotional
discharge
the
assumption
of
which
was
explained
in
the
psychological
discussions
of
the
previous
chapter
this
can
make
no
difference
for
us
for
we
must
always
be
ready
to
drop
our
auxiliary
ideas
whenever
we
deem
ourselves
in
position
to
replace
them
by
something
else
approaching
more
closely
to
the
unknown
reality
let
us
now
try
to
correct
some
views
which
might
be
erroneously
formed
as
long
as
we
regarded
the
two
systems
in
the
crudest
and
most
obvious
sense
as
two
localities
within
the
psychic
apparatus
views
which
have
left
their
traces
in
the
terms
repression
and
penetration
thus
when
we
say
that
an
unconscious
idea
strives
for
transference
into
the
foreconscious
in
order
later
to
penetrate
consciousness
we
do
not
mean
that
a
second
idea
is
to
be
formed
situated
in
a
new
locality
like
an
interlineation
near
which
the
original
continues
to
remain
also
when
we
speak
of
penetration
into
consciousness
we
wish
carefully
to
avoid
any
idea
of
change
of
locality
when
we
say
that
a
foreconscious
idea
is
repressed
and
subsequently
taken
up
by
the
unconscious
we
might
be
tempted
by
these
figures
borrowed
from
the
idea
of
a
struggle
over
a
territory
to
assume
that
an
arrangement
is
really
broken
up
in
one
psychic
locality
and
replaced
by
a
new
one
in
the
other
locality
for
these
comparisons
we
substitute
what
would
seem
to
correspond
better
with
the
real
state
of
affairs
by
saying
that
an
energy
occupation
is
displaced
to
or
withdrawn
from
a
certain
arrangement
so
that
the
psychic
formation
falls
under
the
domination
of
a
system
or
is
withdrawn
from
the
same
here
again
we
replace
a
topical
mode
of
presentation
by
a
dynamic
it
is
not
the
psychic
formation
that
appears
to
us
as
the
moving
factor
but
the
innervation
of
the
same
i
deem
it
appropriate
and
justifiable
however
to
apply
ourselves
still
further
to
the
illustrative
conception
of
the
two
systems
we
shall
avoid
any
misapplication
of
this
manner
of
representation
if
we
remember
that
presentations
thoughts
and
psychic
formations
should
generally
not
be
localized
in
the
organic
elements
of
the
nervous
system
but
so
to
speak
between
them
where
resistances
and
paths
form
the
correlate
corresponding
to
them
everything
that
can
become
an
object
of
our
internal
perception
is
virtual
like
the
image
in
the
telescope
produced
by
the
passage
of
the
rays
of
light
but
we
are
justified
in
assuming
the
existence
of
the
systems
which
have
nothing
psychic
in
themselves
and
which
never
become
accessible
to
our
psychic
perception
corresponding
to
the
lenses
of
the
telescope
which
design
the
image
if
we
continue
this
comparison
we
may
say
that
the
censor
between
two
systems
corresponds
to
the
refraction
of
rays
during
their
passage
into
a
new
medium
thus
far
we
have
made
psychology
on
our
own
responsibility
it
is
now
time
to
examine
the
theoretical
opinions
governing
psychology
and
to
test
their
relation
to
our
theories
the
question
of
the
unconscious
in
psychology
is
according
to
the
authoritative
words
of
lipps
less
a
psychological
question
than
the
question
of
psychology
as
long
as
psychology
settled
this
question
with
the
verbal
explanation
that
the
psychic
is
the
conscious
and
that
unconscious
psychic
occurrences
are
an
obvious
contradiction
a
psychological
estimate
of
the
observations
gained
by
the
physician
from
abnormal
mental
states
was
precluded
the
physician
and
the
philosopher
agree
only
when
both
acknowledge
that
unconscious
psychic
processes
are
the
appropriate
and
expression
for
an
established
fact
the
physician
can
not
but
reject
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
the
assertion
that
consciousness
is
the
indispensable
quality
of
the
psychic
he
may
assume
if
his
respect
for
the
utterings
of
the
philosophers
still
be
strong
enough
that
he
and
they
do
not
treat
the
same
subject
and
do
not
pursue
the
same
science
for
a
single
intelligent
observation
of
the
psychic
life
of
a
neurotic
a
single
analysis
of
a
dream
must
force
upon
him
the
unalterable
conviction
that
the
most
complicated
and
correct
mental
operations
to
which
no
one
will
refuse
the
name
of
psychic
occurrences
may
take
place
without
exciting
the
consciousness
of
the
person
it
is
true
that
the
physician
does
not
learn
of
these
unconscious
processes
until
they
have
exerted
such
an
effect
on
consciousness
as
to
admit
communication
or
observation
but
this
effect
of
consciousness
may
show
a
psychic
character
widely
differing
from
the
unconscious
process
so
that
the
internal
perception
can
not
possibly
recognize
the
one
as
a
substitute
for
the
other
the
physician
must
reserve
for
himself
the
right
to
penetrate
by
a
process
of
deduction
from
the
effect
on
consciousness
to
the
unconscious
psychic
process
he
learns
in
this
way
that
the
effect
on
consciousness
is
only
a
remote
psychic
product
of
the
unconscious
process
and
that
the
latter
has
not
become
conscious
as
such
that
it
has
been
in
existence
and
operative
without
betraying
itself
in
any
way
to
consciousness
a
reaction
from
the
of
the
quality
of
consciousness
becomes
the
indispensable
preliminary
condition
for
any
correct
insight
into
the
behavior
of
the
psychic
in
the
words
of
lipps
the
unconscious
must
be
accepted
as
the
general
basis
of
the
psychic
life
the
unconscious
is
the
larger
circle
which
includes
within
itself
the
smaller
circle
of
the
conscious
everything
conscious
has
its
preliminary
step
in
the
unconscious
whereas
the
unconscious
may
stop
with
this
step
and
still
claim
full
value
as
a
psychic
activity
properly
speaking
the
unconscious
is
the
real
psychic
inner
nature
is
just
as
unknown
to
us
as
the
reality
of
the
external
world
and
it
is
just
as
imperfectly
reported
to
us
through
the
data
of
consciousness
as
is
the
external
world
through
the
indications
of
our
sensory
a
series
of
dream
problems
which
have
intensely
occupied
older
authors
will
be
laid
aside
when
the
old
opposition
between
conscious
life
and
dream
life
is
abandoned
and
the
unconscious
psychic
assigned
to
its
proper
place
thus
many
of
the
activities
whose
performances
in
the
dream
have
excited
our
admiration
are
now
no
longer
to
be
attributed
to
the
dream
but
to
unconscious
thinking
which
is
also
active
during
the
day
if
according
to
scherner
the
dream
seems
to
play
with
a
symboling
representation
of
the
body
we
know
that
this
is
the
work
of
certain
unconscious
phantasies
which
have
probably
given
in
to
sexual
emotions
and
that
these
phantasies
come
to
expression
not
only
in
dreams
but
also
in
hysterical
phobias
and
in
other
symptoms
if
the
dream
continues
and
settles
activities
of
the
day
and
even
brings
to
light
valuable
inspirations
we
have
only
to
subtract
from
it
the
dream
disguise
as
a
feat
of
and
a
mark
of
assistance
from
obscure
forces
in
the
depth
of
the
mind
the
devil
in
tartini
sonata
dream
the
intellectual
task
as
such
must
be
attributed
to
the
same
psychic
forces
which
perform
all
such
tasks
during
the
day
we
are
probably
far
too
much
inclined
to
the
conscious
character
even
of
intellectual
and
artistic
productions
from
the
communications
of
some
of
the
most
highly
productive
persons
such
as
goethe
and
helmholtz
we
learn
indeed
that
the
most
essential
and
original
parts
in
their
creations
came
to
them
in
the
form
of
inspirations
and
reached
their
perceptions
almost
finished
there
is
nothing
strange
about
the
assistance
of
the
conscious
activity
in
other
cases
where
there
was
a
concerted
effort
of
all
the
psychic
forces
but
it
is
a
much
abused
privilege
of
the
conscious
activity
that
it
is
allowed
to
hide
from
us
all
other
activities
wherever
it
participates
it
will
hardly
be
worth
while
to
take
up
the
historical
significance
of
dreams
as
a
special
subject
where
for
instance
a
chieftain
has
been
urged
through
a
dream
to
engage
in
a
bold
undertaking
the
success
of
which
has
had
the
effect
of
changing
history
a
new
problem
results
only
so
long
as
the
dream
regarded
as
a
strange
power
is
contrasted
with
other
more
familiar
psychic
forces
the
problem
however
disappears
when
we
regard
the
dream
as
a
form
of
expression
for
feelings
which
are
burdened
with
resistance
during
the
day
and
which
can
receive
reinforcements
at
night
from
deep
emotional
sources
but
the
great
respect
shown
by
the
ancients
for
the
dream
is
based
on
a
correct
psychological
surmise
it
is
a
homage
paid
to
the
unsubdued
and
indestructible
in
the
human
mind
and
to
the
demoniacal
which
furnishes
the
and
which
we
find
again
in
our
unconscious
not
inadvisedly
do
i
use
the
expression
in
our
unconscious
for
what
we
so
designate
does
not
coincide
with
the
unconscious
of
the
philosophers
nor
with
the
unconscious
of
lipps
in
the
latter
uses
it
is
intended
to
designate
only
the
opposite
of
conscious
that
there
are
also
unconscious
psychic
processes
beside
the
conscious
ones
is
the
hotly
contested
and
energetically
defended
issue
lipps
gives
us
the
more
theory
that
everything
psychic
exists
as
unconscious
but
that
some
of
it
may
exist
also
as
conscious
but
it
was
not
to
prove
this
theory
that
we
have
adduced
the
phenomena
of
the
dream
and
of
the
hysterical
symptom
formation
the
observation
of
normal
life
alone
suffices
to
establish
its
correctness
beyond
any
doubt
the
new
fact
that
we
have
learned
from
the
analysis
of
the
psychopathological
formations
and
indeed
from
their
first
member
viz
dreams
is
that
the
unconscious
hence
the
psychic
occurs
as
a
function
of
two
separate
systems
and
that
it
occurs
as
such
even
in
normal
psychic
life
consequently
there
are
two
kinds
of
unconscious
which
we
do
not
as
yet
find
distinguished
by
the
psychologists
both
are
unconscious
in
the
psychological
sense
but
in
our
sense
the
first
which
we
call
is
likewise
incapable
of
consciousness
whereas
the
second
we
term
forec
because
its
emotions
after
the
observance
of
certain
rules
can
reach
consciousness
perhaps
not
before
they
have
again
undergone
censorship
but
still
regardless
of
the
unc
system
the
fact
that
in
order
to
attain
consciousness
the
emotions
must
traverse
an
unalterable
series
of
events
or
succession
of
instances
as
is
betrayed
through
their
alteration
by
the
censor
has
helped
us
to
draw
a
comparison
from
spatiality
we
described
the
relations
of
the
two
systems
to
each
other
and
to
consciousness
by
saying
that
the
system
forec
is
like
a
screen
between
the
system
unc
and
consciousness
the
system
forec
not
only
bars
access
to
consciousness
but
also
controls
the
entrance
to
voluntary
motility
and
is
capable
of
sending
out
a
sum
of
mobile
energy
a
portion
of
which
is
familiar
to
us
as
attention
we
must
also
steer
clear
of
the
distinctions
superconscious
and
subconscious
which
have
found
so
much
favor
in
the
more
recent
literature
on
the
psychoneuroses
for
just
such
a
distinction
seems
to
emphasize
the
equivalence
of
the
psychic
and
the
conscious
what
part
now
remains
in
our
description
of
the
once
and
consciousness
none
other
than
that
of
a
sensory
organ
for
the
perception
of
psychic
qualities
according
to
the
fundamental
idea
of
schematic
undertaking
we
can
conceive
the
conscious
perception
only
as
the
particular
activity
of
an
independent
system
for
which
the
abbreviated
designation
cons
commends
itself
this
system
we
conceive
to
be
similar
in
its
mechanical
characteristics
to
the
perception
system
p
hence
excitable
by
qualities
and
incapable
of
retaining
the
trace
of
changes
it
is
devoid
of
memory
the
psychic
apparatus
which
with
the
sensory
organs
of
the
is
turned
to
the
outer
world
is
itself
the
outer
world
for
the
sensory
organ
of
cons
the
teleological
justification
of
which
rests
on
this
relationship
we
are
here
once
more
confronted
with
the
principle
of
the
succession
of
instances
which
seems
to
dominate
the
structure
of
the
apparatus
the
material
under
excitement
flows
to
the
cons
sensory
organ
from
two
sides
firstly
from
the
whose
excitement
qualitatively
determined
probably
experiences
a
new
elaboration
until
it
comes
to
conscious
perception
and
secondly
from
the
interior
of
the
apparatus
itself
the
quantitative
processes
of
which
are
perceived
as
a
qualitative
series
of
pleasure
and
pain
as
soon
as
they
have
undergone
certain
changes
the
philosophers
who
have
learned
that
correct
and
highly
complicated
thought
structures
are
possible
even
without
the
coöperation
of
consciousness
have
found
it
difficult
to
attribute
any
function
to
consciousness
it
has
appeared
to
them
a
superfluous
mirroring
of
the
perfected
psychic
process
the
analogy
of
our
cons
system
with
the
systems
of
perception
relieves
us
of
this
embarrassment
we
see
that
perception
through
our
sensory
organs
results
in
directing
the
occupation
of
attention
to
those
paths
on
which
the
incoming
sensory
excitement
is
diffused
the
qualitative
excitement
of
the
serves
the
mobile
quantity
of
the
psychic
apparatus
as
a
regulator
for
its
discharge
we
may
claim
the
same
function
for
the
overlying
sensory
organ
of
the
cons
system
by
assuming
new
qualities
it
furnishes
a
new
contribution
toward
the
guidance
and
suitable
distribution
of
the
mobile
occupation
quantities
by
means
of
the
perceptions
of
pleasure
and
pain
it
influences
the
course
of
the
occupations
within
the
psychic
apparatus
which
normally
operates
unconsciously
and
through
the
displacement
of
quantities
it
is
probable
that
the
principle
of
pain
first
regulates
the
displacements
of
occupation
automatically
but
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
consciousness
of
these
qualities
adds
a
second
and
more
subtle
regulation
which
may
even
oppose
the
first
and
perfect
the
working
capacity
of
the
apparatus
by
placing
it
in
a
position
contrary
to
its
original
design
for
occupying
and
developing
even
that
which
is
connected
with
the
liberation
of
pain
we
learn
from
neuropsychology
that
an
important
part
in
the
functional
activity
of
the
apparatus
is
attributed
to
such
regulations
through
the
qualitative
excitation
of
the
sensory
organs
the
automatic
control
of
the
primary
principle
of
pain
and
the
restriction
of
mental
capacity
connected
with
it
are
broken
by
the
sensible
regulations
which
in
their
turn
are
again
automatisms
we
learn
that
the
repression
which
though
originally
expedient
terminates
nevertheless
in
a
harmful
rejection
of
inhibition
and
of
psychic
domination
is
so
much
more
easily
accomplished
with
reminiscences
than
with
perceptions
because
in
the
former
there
is
no
increase
in
occupation
through
the
excitement
of
the
psychic
sensory
organs
when
an
idea
to
be
rejected
has
once
failed
to
become
conscious
because
it
has
succumbed
to
repression
it
can
be
repressed
on
other
occasions
only
because
it
has
been
withdrawn
from
conscious
perception
on
other
grounds
these
are
hints
employed
by
therapy
in
order
to
bring
about
a
retrogression
of
accomplished
repressions
the
value
of
the
which
is
produced
by
the
regulating
influence
of
the
cons
sensory
organ
on
the
mobile
quantity
is
demonstrated
in
the
teleological
connection
by
nothing
more
clearly
than
by
the
creation
of
a
new
series
of
qualities
and
consequently
a
new
regulation
which
constitutes
the
precedence
of
man
over
the
animals
for
the
mental
processes
are
in
themselves
devoid
of
quality
except
for
the
excitements
of
pleasure
and
pain
accompanying
them
which
as
we
know
are
to
be
held
in
check
as
possible
disturbances
of
thought
in
order
to
endow
them
with
a
quality
they
are
associated
in
man
with
verbal
memories
the
qualitative
remnants
of
which
suffice
to
draw
upon
them
the
attention
of
consciousness
which
in
turn
endows
thought
with
a
new
mobile
energy
the
manifold
problems
of
consciousness
in
their
entirety
can
be
examined
only
through
an
analysis
of
the
hysterical
mental
process
from
this
analysis
we
receive
the
impression
that
the
transition
from
the
foreconscious
to
the
occupation
of
consciousness
is
also
connected
with
a
censorship
similar
to
the
one
between
the
unc
and
the
forec
this
censorship
too
begins
to
act
only
with
the
reaching
of
a
certain
quantitative
degree
so
that
few
intense
thought
formations
escape
it
every
possible
case
of
detention
from
consciousness
as
well
as
of
penetration
to
consciousness
under
restriction
is
found
included
within
the
picture
of
the
psychoneurotic
phenomena
every
case
points
to
the
intimate
and
twofold
connection
between
the
censor
and
consciousness
i
shall
conclude
these
psychological
discussions
with
the
report
of
two
such
occurrences
on
the
occasion
of
a
consultation
a
few
years
ago
the
subject
was
an
intelligent
and
girl
her
attire
was
strange
whereas
a
woman
garb
is
usually
groomed
to
the
last
fold
she
had
one
of
her
stockings
hanging
down
and
two
of
her
waist
buttons
opened
she
complained
of
pains
in
one
of
her
legs
and
exposed
her
leg
unrequested
her
chief
complaint
however
was
in
her
own
words
as
follows
she
had
a
feeling
in
her
body
as
if
something
was
stuck
into
it
which
moved
to
and
fro
and
made
her
tremble
through
and
through
this
sometimes
made
her
whole
body
stiff
on
hearing
this
my
colleague
in
consultation
looked
at
me
the
complaint
was
quite
plain
to
him
to
both
of
us
it
seemed
peculiar
that
the
patient
mother
thought
nothing
of
the
matter
of
course
she
herself
must
have
been
repeatedly
in
the
situation
described
by
her
child
as
for
the
girl
she
had
no
idea
of
the
import
of
her
words
or
she
would
never
have
allowed
them
to
pass
her
lips
here
the
censor
had
been
deceived
so
successfully
that
under
the
mask
of
an
innocent
complaint
a
phantasy
was
admitted
to
consciousness
which
otherwise
would
have
remained
in
the
foreconscious
another
example
i
began
the
psychoanalytic
treatment
of
a
boy
of
fourteen
years
who
was
suffering
from
hysterical
vomiting
headache
by
assuring
him
that
after
closing
his
eyes
he
would
see
pictures
or
have
ideas
which
i
requested
him
to
communicate
to
me
he
answered
by
describing
pictures
the
last
impression
he
had
received
before
coming
to
me
was
visually
revived
in
his
memory
he
had
played
a
game
of
checkers
with
his
uncle
and
now
saw
the
checkerboard
before
him
he
commented
on
various
positions
that
were
favorable
or
unfavorable
on
moves
that
were
not
safe
to
make
he
then
saw
a
dagger
lying
on
the
an
object
belonging
to
his
father
but
transferred
to
the
by
his
phantasy
then
a
sickle
was
lying
on
the
board
next
a
scythe
was
added
and
finally
he
beheld
the
likeness
of
an
old
peasant
mowing
the
grass
in
front
of
the
boy
distant
parental
home
a
few
days
later
i
discovered
the
meaning
of
this
series
of
pictures
disagreeable
family
relations
had
made
the
boy
nervous
it
was
the
case
of
a
strict
and
crabbed
father
who
lived
unhappily
with
his
mother
and
whose
educational
methods
consisted
in
threats
of
the
separation
of
his
father
from
his
tender
and
delicate
mother
and
the
remarrying
of
his
father
who
one
day
brought
home
a
young
woman
as
his
new
mamma
the
illness
of
the
boy
broke
out
a
few
days
later
it
was
the
suppressed
anger
against
his
father
that
had
composed
these
pictures
into
intelligible
allusions
the
material
was
furnished
by
a
reminiscence
from
mythology
the
sickle
was
the
one
with
which
zeus
castrated
his
father
the
scythe
and
the
likeness
of
the
peasant
represented
kronos
the
violent
old
man
who
eats
his
children
and
upon
whom
zeus
wreaks
vengeance
in
so
unfilial
a
manner
the
marriage
of
the
father
gave
the
boy
an
opportunity
to
return
the
reproaches
and
threats
of
his
father
which
had
previously
been
made
because
the
child
played
with
his
genitals
the
checkerboard
the
prohibitive
moves
the
dagger
with
which
a
person
may
be
killed
we
have
here
long
repressed
memories
and
their
unconscious
remnants
which
under
the
guise
of
senseless
pictures
have
slipped
into
consciousness
by
devious
paths
left
open
to
them
i
should
then
expect
to
find
the
theoretical
value
of
the
study
of
dreams
in
its
contribution
to
psychological
knowledge
and
in
its
preparation
for
an
understanding
of
neuroses
who
can
foresee
the
importance
of
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
activities
of
the
psychic
apparatus
when
even
our
present
state
of
knowledge
produces
a
happy
therapeutic
influence
in
the
curable
forms
of
the
psychoneuroses
what
about
the
practical
value
of
such
study
some
one
may
ask
for
psychic
knowledge
and
for
the
discovering
of
the
secret
peculiarities
of
individual
character
have
not
the
unconscious
feelings
revealed
by
the
dream
the
value
of
real
forces
in
the
psychic
life
should
we
take
lightly
the
ethical
significance
of
the
suppressed
wishes
which
as
they
now
create
dreams
may
some
day
create
other
things
i
do
not
feel
justified
in
answering
these
questions
i
have
not
thought
further
upon
this
side
of
the
dream
problem
i
believe
however
that
at
all
events
the
roman
emperor
was
in
the
wrong
who
ordered
one
of
his
subjects
executed
because
the
latter
dreamt
that
he
had
killed
the
emperor
he
should
first
have
endeavored
to
discover
the
significance
of
the
dream
most
probably
it
was
not
what
it
seemed
to
be
and
even
if
a
dream
of
different
content
had
the
significance
of
this
offense
against
majesty
it
would
still
have
been
in
place
to
remember
the
words
of
plato
that
the
virtuous
man
contents
himself
with
dreaming
that
which
the
wicked
man
does
in
actual
life
i
am
therefore
of
the
opinion
that
it
is
best
to
accord
freedom
to
dreams
whether
any
reality
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
unconscious
wishes
and
in
what
sense
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
offhand
reality
must
naturally
be
denied
to
all
transition
and
intermediate
thoughts
if
we
had
before
us
the
unconscious
wishes
brought
to
their
last
and
truest
expression
we
should
still
do
well
to
remember
that
more
than
one
single
form
of
existence
must
be
ascribed
to
the
psychic
reality
action
and
the
conscious
expression
of
thought
mostly
suffice
for
the
practical
need
of
judging
a
man
character
action
above
all
merits
to
be
placed
in
the
first
rank
for
many
of
the
impulses
penetrating
consciousness
are
neutralized
by
real
forces
of
the
psychic
life
before
they
are
converted
into
action
indeed
the
reason
why
they
frequently
do
not
encounter
any
psychic
obstacle
on
their
way
is
because
the
unconscious
is
certain
of
their
meeting
with
resistances
later
in
any
case
it
is
instructive
to
become
familiar
with
the
much
soil
from
which
our
virtues
proudly
arise
for
the
complication
of
human
character
moving
dynamically
in
all
directions
very
rarely
accommodates
itself
to
adjustment
through
a
simple
alternative
as
our
antiquated
moral
philosophy
would
have
it
and
how
about
the
value
of
the
dream
for
a
knowledge
of
the
future
that
of
course
we
can
not
consider
one
feels
inclined
to
substitute
for
a
knowledge
of
the
past
for
the
dream
originates
from
the
past
in
every
sense
to
be
sure
the
ancient
belief
that
the
dream
reveals
the
future
is
not
entirely
devoid
of
truth
by
representing
to
us
a
wish
as
fulfilled
the
dream
certainly
leads
us
into
the
future
but
this
future
taken
by
the
dreamer
as
present
has
been
formed
into
the
likeness
of
that
past
by
the
indestructible
wish
