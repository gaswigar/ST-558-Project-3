the
pension
beaurepas
by
henry
james
chapter
i
was
not
rich
on
the
contrary
and
i
had
been
told
the
pension
beaurepas
was
cheap
i
had
moreover
been
told
that
a
house
is
a
capital
place
for
the
study
of
human
nature
i
had
a
fancy
for
a
literary
career
and
a
friend
of
mine
had
said
to
me
if
you
mean
to
write
you
ought
to
go
and
live
in
a
there
is
no
other
such
place
to
pick
up
material
i
had
read
something
of
this
kind
in
a
letter
addressed
by
stendhal
to
his
sister
i
have
a
passionate
desire
to
know
human
nature
and
have
a
great
mind
to
live
in
a
where
people
can
not
conceal
their
real
characters
i
was
an
admirer
of
la
chartreuse
de
parme
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
one
could
not
do
better
than
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
its
author
i
remembered
too
the
magnificent
in
balzac
pere
goriot
the
pension
bourgeoise
des
deux
sexes
et
autres
kept
by
madame
vauquer
nee
de
conflans
magnificent
i
mean
as
a
piece
of
portraiture
the
establishment
as
an
establishment
was
certainly
sordid
enough
and
i
hoped
for
better
things
from
the
pension
beaurepas
this
institution
was
one
of
the
most
esteemed
in
geneva
and
standing
in
a
little
garden
of
its
own
not
far
from
the
lake
had
a
very
homely
comfortable
sociable
aspect
the
regular
entrance
was
as
one
might
say
at
the
back
which
looked
upon
the
street
or
rather
upon
a
little
place
adorned
like
every
place
in
geneva
great
or
small
with
a
fountain
this
fact
was
not
prepossessing
for
on
crossing
the
threshold
you
found
yourself
more
or
less
in
the
kitchen
encompassed
with
culinary
odours
this
however
was
no
great
matter
for
at
the
pension
beaurepas
there
was
no
attempt
at
gentility
or
at
concealment
of
the
domestic
machinery
the
latter
was
of
a
very
simple
sort
madame
beaurepas
was
an
excellent
little
old
woman
she
was
very
far
advanced
in
life
and
had
been
keeping
a
pension
for
forty
years
whose
only
faults
were
that
she
was
slightly
deaf
that
she
was
fond
of
a
surreptitious
pinch
of
snuff
and
that
at
the
age
of
three
she
wore
flowers
in
her
cap
there
was
a
tradition
in
the
house
that
she
was
not
so
deaf
as
she
pretended
that
she
feigned
this
infirmity
in
order
to
possess
herself
of
the
secrets
of
her
lodgers
but
i
never
subscribed
to
this
theory
i
am
convinced
that
madame
beaurepas
had
outlived
the
period
of
indiscreet
curiosity
she
was
a
philosopher
on
a
basis
she
had
been
having
lodgers
for
forty
years
and
all
that
she
asked
of
them
was
that
they
should
pay
their
bills
make
use
of
the
and
fold
their
napkins
she
cared
very
little
for
their
secrets
ai
vus
de
toutes
les
couleurs
she
said
to
me
she
had
quite
ceased
to
care
for
individuals
she
cared
only
for
types
for
categories
her
large
observation
had
made
her
acquainted
with
a
great
number
and
her
mind
was
a
complete
collection
of
heads
she
flattered
herself
that
she
knew
at
a
glance
where
to
a
and
if
she
made
any
mistakes
her
deportment
never
betrayed
them
i
think
that
as
regards
individuals
she
had
neither
likes
nor
dislikes
but
she
was
capable
of
expressing
esteem
or
contempt
for
a
species
she
had
her
own
ways
i
suppose
of
manifesting
her
approval
but
her
manner
of
indicating
the
reverse
was
simple
and
unvarying
je
trouve
que
deplace
this
exhausted
her
view
of
the
matter
if
one
of
her
inmates
had
put
arsenic
into
the
i
believe
madame
beaurepas
would
have
contented
herself
with
remarking
that
the
proceeding
was
out
of
place
the
line
of
misconduct
to
which
she
most
objected
was
an
undue
assumption
of
gentility
she
had
no
patience
with
boarders
who
gave
themselves
airs
when
people
come
chez
moi
it
is
not
to
cut
a
figure
in
the
world
i
have
never
had
that
illusion
i
remember
hearing
her
say
and
when
you
pay
seven
francs
a
day
tout
compris
it
comprises
everything
but
the
right
to
look
down
upon
the
others
but
there
are
people
who
the
less
they
pay
the
more
they
take
themselves
au
serieux
my
most
difficult
boarders
have
always
been
those
who
have
had
the
little
rooms
madame
beaurepas
had
a
niece
a
young
woman
of
some
forty
odd
years
and
the
two
ladies
with
the
assistance
of
a
couple
of
peasant
women
kept
the
house
going
if
on
your
exits
and
entrances
you
peeped
into
the
kitchen
it
made
very
little
difference
for
celestine
the
cook
had
no
pretension
to
be
an
invisible
functionary
or
to
deal
in
occult
methods
she
was
always
at
your
service
with
a
grateful
grin
she
blacked
your
boots
she
trudged
off
to
fetch
a
cab
she
would
have
carried
your
baggage
if
you
had
allowed
her
on
her
broad
little
back
she
was
always
tramping
in
and
out
between
her
kitchen
and
the
fountain
in
the
place
where
it
often
seemed
to
me
that
a
large
part
of
the
preparation
for
our
dinner
went
forward
the
wringing
out
of
towels
and
the
washing
of
potatoes
and
cabbages
the
scouring
of
saucepans
and
cleansing
of
water
bottles
you
enjoyed
from
the
doorstep
a
perpetual
of
celestine
and
of
her
large
loose
woollen
ankles
as
she
craned
from
the
waist
over
into
the
fountain
and
dabbled
in
her
various
utensils
this
sounds
as
if
life
went
on
in
a
very
fashion
at
the
pension
beaurepas
as
if
the
tone
of
the
establishment
were
sordid
but
such
was
not
at
all
the
case
we
were
simply
very
bourgeois
we
practised
the
good
old
genevese
principle
of
not
sacrificing
to
appearances
this
is
an
excellent
principle
when
you
have
the
reality
we
had
the
reality
at
the
pension
beaurepas
we
had
it
in
the
shape
of
soft
short
beds
equipped
with
fluffy
duvets
of
admirable
coffee
served
to
us
in
the
morning
by
celestine
in
person
as
we
lay
recumbent
on
these
downy
couches
of
copious
wholesome
succulent
dinners
conformable
to
the
best
provincial
traditions
for
myself
i
thought
the
pension
beaurepas
picturesque
and
this
with
me
at
that
time
was
a
great
word
i
was
young
and
ingenuous
i
had
just
come
from
america
i
wished
to
perfect
myself
in
the
french
tongue
and
i
innocently
believed
that
it
flourished
by
lake
leman
i
used
to
go
to
lectures
at
the
academy
and
come
home
with
a
violent
appetite
i
always
enjoyed
my
morning
walk
across
the
long
bridge
there
was
only
one
just
there
in
those
days
which
spans
the
deep
blue
of
the
lake
and
up
the
dark
steep
streets
of
the
old
calvinistic
city
the
garden
faced
this
way
toward
the
lake
and
the
old
town
and
this
was
the
pleasantest
approach
to
the
house
there
was
a
high
wall
with
a
double
gate
in
the
middle
flanked
by
a
couple
of
ancient
massive
posts
the
big
rusty
grille
contained
some
the
garden
was
rather
mouldy
and
weedy
tangled
and
untended
but
it
contained
a
little
thin
flowing
fountain
several
green
benches
a
rickety
little
table
of
the
same
complexion
and
three
in
tubs
which
were
deposited
as
effectively
as
possible
in
front
of
the
windows
of
the
salon
chapter
ii
as
commonly
happens
in
the
rustle
of
petticoats
was
at
the
pension
beaurepas
the
most
familiar
form
of
the
human
tread
there
was
the
usual
allotment
of
economical
widows
and
old
maids
and
to
maintain
the
balance
of
the
sexes
there
were
only
an
old
frenchman
and
a
young
american
it
hardly
made
the
matter
easier
that
the
old
frenchman
came
from
lausanne
he
was
a
native
of
that
estimable
town
but
he
had
once
spent
six
months
in
paris
he
had
tasted
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
he
had
got
beyond
lausanne
whose
resources
he
pronounced
inadequate
lausanne
as
he
said
manquait
when
obliged
for
reasons
which
he
never
specified
to
bring
his
residence
in
paris
to
a
close
he
had
fallen
back
on
geneva
he
had
broken
his
fall
at
the
pension
beaurepas
geneva
was
after
all
more
like
paris
and
at
a
genevese
there
was
sure
to
be
plenty
of
americans
with
whom
one
could
talk
about
the
french
metropolis
pigeonneau
was
a
little
lean
man
with
a
large
narrow
nose
who
sat
a
great
deal
in
the
garden
reading
with
the
aid
of
a
large
magnifying
glass
a
volume
from
the
cabinet
de
lecture
one
day
a
fortnight
after
my
arrival
at
the
pension
beaurepas
i
came
back
rather
earlier
than
usual
from
my
academic
session
it
wanted
half
an
hour
of
the
midday
breakfast
i
went
into
the
salon
with
the
design
of
possessing
myself
of
the
day
galignani
before
one
of
the
little
english
old
maids
should
have
removed
it
to
her
virginal
bower
a
privilege
to
which
madame
beaurepas
frequently
alluded
as
one
of
the
attractions
of
the
establishment
in
the
salon
i
found
a
a
tall
gentleman
in
a
high
black
hat
whom
i
immediately
recognised
as
a
compatriot
i
had
often
seen
him
or
his
equivalent
in
the
hotel
parlours
of
my
native
land
he
apparently
supposed
himself
to
be
at
the
present
moment
in
a
hotel
parlour
his
hat
was
on
his
head
or
rather
half
off
it
pushed
back
from
his
forehead
and
rather
suspended
than
poised
he
stood
before
a
table
on
which
old
newspapers
were
scattered
one
of
which
he
had
taken
up
and
with
his
on
his
nose
was
holding
out
at
it
was
that
honourable
but
extremely
diminutive
sheet
the
journal
de
geneve
a
newspaper
of
about
the
size
of
a
as
i
drew
near
looking
for
my
galignani
the
tall
gentleman
gave
me
over
the
top
of
his
a
somewhat
solemn
stare
presently
however
before
i
had
time
to
lay
my
hand
on
the
object
of
my
search
he
silently
offered
me
the
journal
de
geneve
it
appears
he
said
to
be
the
paper
of
the
country
yes
i
answered
i
believe
it
the
best
he
gazed
at
it
again
still
holding
it
at
as
if
it
had
been
a
well
he
said
i
suppose
it
natural
a
small
country
should
have
small
papers
you
could
wrap
it
up
mountains
and
all
in
one
of
our
dailies
i
found
my
galignani
and
went
off
with
it
into
the
garden
where
i
seated
myself
on
a
bench
in
the
shade
presently
i
saw
the
tall
gentleman
in
the
hat
appear
in
one
of
the
open
windows
of
the
salon
and
stand
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
legs
a
little
apart
he
looked
very
much
bored
and
i
do
know
why
i
immediately
began
to
feel
sorry
for
him
he
was
not
at
all
a
picturesque
personage
he
looked
like
a
jaded
faded
man
of
business
but
after
a
little
he
came
into
the
garden
and
began
to
stroll
about
and
then
his
restless
unoccupied
carriage
and
the
vague
unacquainted
manner
in
which
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
place
seemed
to
make
it
proper
that
as
an
older
resident
i
should
exercise
a
certain
hospitality
i
said
something
to
him
and
he
came
and
sat
down
beside
me
on
my
bench
clasping
one
of
his
long
knees
in
his
hands
when
is
it
this
big
breakfast
of
theirs
comes
off
he
inquired
that
what
i
call
it
the
little
breakfast
and
the
big
breakfast
i
never
thought
i
should
live
to
see
the
time
when
i
should
care
to
eat
two
breakfasts
but
a
man
glad
to
do
anything
over
here
for
myself
i
observed
i
find
plenty
to
do
he
turned
his
head
and
glanced
at
me
with
a
dry
deliberate
looking
eye
you
getting
used
to
the
life
are
you
i
like
the
life
very
much
i
answered
laughing
how
long
have
you
tried
it
do
you
mean
in
this
place
well
i
mean
anywhere
it
seems
to
me
pretty
much
the
same
all
over
i
have
been
in
this
house
only
a
fortnight
i
said
well
what
should
you
say
from
what
you
have
seen
my
companion
asked
oh
said
i
you
can
see
all
there
is
immediately
it
very
simple
sweet
simplicity
eh
i
afraid
my
two
ladies
will
find
it
too
simple
everything
is
very
good
i
went
on
and
madame
beaurepas
is
a
charming
old
woman
and
then
it
very
cheap
cheap
is
it
my
friend
repeated
meditatively
does
it
strike
you
so
i
asked
i
thought
it
very
possible
he
had
not
inquired
the
terms
but
he
appeared
not
to
have
heard
me
he
sat
there
clasping
his
knee
and
blinking
in
a
contemplative
manner
at
the
sunshine
are
you
from
the
united
states
sir
he
presently
demanded
turning
his
head
again
yes
sir
i
replied
and
i
mentioned
the
place
of
my
nativity
i
presumed
he
said
that
you
were
american
or
english
i
from
the
united
states
myself
from
new
york
city
many
of
our
people
here
not
so
many
as
i
believe
there
have
sometimes
been
there
are
two
or
three
ladies
well
my
interlocutor
declared
i
am
very
fond
of
ladies
society
i
think
when
it
superior
there
nothing
comes
up
to
it
i
got
two
ladies
here
myself
i
must
make
you
acquainted
with
them
i
rejoined
that
i
should
be
delighted
and
i
inquired
of
my
friend
whether
he
had
been
long
in
europe
well
it
seems
precious
long
he
said
but
my
time
not
up
yet
we
have
been
here
fourteen
weeks
and
a
half
are
you
travelling
for
pleasure
i
asked
my
companion
turned
his
head
again
and
looked
at
me
looked
at
me
so
long
in
silence
that
i
at
last
also
turned
and
met
his
eyes
no
sir
he
said
presently
no
sir
he
repeated
after
a
considerable
interval
excuse
me
said
i
for
there
was
something
so
solemn
in
his
tone
that
i
feared
i
had
been
indiscreet
he
took
no
notice
of
my
ejaculation
he
simply
continued
to
look
at
me
i
travelling
he
said
at
last
to
please
the
doctors
they
seemed
to
think
they
would
like
it
ah
they
sent
you
abroad
for
your
health
they
sent
me
abroad
because
they
were
so
confoundedly
muddled
they
did
know
what
else
to
do
that
often
the
best
thing
i
ventured
to
remark
it
was
a
confession
of
weakness
they
wanted
me
to
stop
plaguing
them
they
did
know
enough
to
cure
me
and
that
the
way
they
thought
they
would
get
round
it
i
wanted
to
be
cured
i
did
want
to
be
transported
i
had
done
any
harm
i
assented
to
the
general
proposition
of
the
inefficiency
of
doctors
and
asked
my
companion
if
he
had
been
seriously
i
did
sleep
he
said
after
some
delay
ah
that
very
annoying
i
suppose
you
were
overworked
i
did
eat
i
took
no
interest
in
my
food
well
i
hope
you
both
eat
and
sleep
now
i
said
i
could
hold
a
pen
my
neighbour
went
on
i
could
sit
still
i
could
walk
from
my
house
to
the
cars
and
it
only
a
little
way
i
lost
my
interest
in
business
you
needed
a
holiday
i
observed
that
what
the
doctors
said
it
was
so
very
smart
of
them
i
had
been
paying
strict
attention
to
business
for
years
in
all
that
time
you
have
never
had
a
holiday
i
exclaimed
with
horror
my
companion
waited
a
little
sundays
he
said
at
last
no
wonder
then
you
were
out
of
sorts
well
sir
said
my
friend
i
should
have
been
where
i
was
three
years
ago
if
i
had
spent
my
time
travelling
round
europe
i
was
in
a
very
advantageous
position
i
did
a
very
large
business
i
was
considerably
interested
in
lumber
he
paused
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
me
a
moment
have
you
any
business
interests
yourself
i
answered
that
i
had
none
and
he
went
on
again
slowly
softly
deliberately
well
sir
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
business
in
the
united
states
is
not
what
it
was
a
short
time
since
business
interests
are
very
insecure
there
seems
to
be
a
general
off
different
parties
offer
different
explanations
of
the
fact
but
so
far
as
i
am
aware
none
of
their
observations
have
set
things
going
again
i
ingeniously
intimated
that
if
business
was
dull
the
time
was
good
for
coming
away
whereupon
my
neighbour
threw
back
his
head
and
stretched
his
legs
a
while
well
sir
that
one
view
of
the
matter
certainly
there
something
to
be
said
for
that
these
things
should
be
looked
at
all
round
that
the
ground
my
wife
took
that
the
ground
he
added
in
a
moment
that
a
lady
would
naturally
take
and
he
gave
a
little
dry
laugh
you
think
it
slightly
illogical
i
remarked
well
sir
the
ground
i
took
was
that
the
worse
a
man
business
is
the
more
it
requires
looking
after
i
should
want
to
go
out
to
take
a
walk
not
even
to
go
to
church
if
my
house
was
on
fire
my
firm
is
not
doing
the
business
it
was
it
like
a
sick
child
it
requires
nursing
what
i
wanted
the
doctors
to
do
was
to
fix
me
up
so
that
i
could
go
on
at
home
i
have
taken
anything
they
have
given
me
and
as
many
times
a
day
i
wanted
to
be
right
there
i
had
my
reasons
i
have
them
still
but
i
came
off
all
the
same
said
my
friend
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
was
a
great
deal
younger
than
he
but
there
was
something
so
simple
and
communicative
in
his
tone
so
expressive
of
a
desire
to
fraternise
and
so
exempt
from
any
theory
of
human
differences
that
i
quite
forgot
his
seniority
and
found
myself
offering
him
paternal
i
advice
do
think
about
all
that
said
i
simply
enjoy
yourself
amuse
yourself
get
well
travel
about
and
see
europe
at
the
end
of
a
year
by
the
time
you
are
ready
to
go
home
things
will
have
improved
over
there
and
you
will
be
quite
well
and
happy
my
friend
laid
his
hand
on
my
knee
he
looked
at
me
for
some
moments
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
say
you
are
very
young
but
he
said
presently
you
have
got
used
to
europe
any
way
chapter
iii
at
breakfast
i
encountered
his
ladies
his
wife
and
daughter
they
were
placed
however
at
a
distance
from
me
and
it
was
not
until
the
pensionnaires
had
dispersed
and
some
of
them
according
to
custom
had
come
out
into
the
garden
that
he
had
an
opportunity
of
making
me
acquainted
with
them
will
you
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
daughter
he
said
moved
apparently
by
a
paternal
inclination
to
provide
this
young
lady
with
social
diversion
she
was
standing
with
her
mother
in
one
of
the
paths
looking
about
with
no
great
complacency
as
i
imagined
at
the
homely
characteristics
of
the
place
and
old
pigeonneau
was
hovering
near
hesitating
apparently
between
the
desire
to
be
urbane
and
the
absence
of
a
pretext
ruck
miss
sophy
ruck
said
my
friend
leading
me
up
ruck
was
a
large
plump
person
with
a
smooth
fair
face
a
somnolent
eye
and
an
elaborate
coiffure
miss
sophy
was
a
girl
of
very
small
and
very
pretty
what
i
suppose
would
have
been
called
a
lively
brunette
both
of
these
ladies
were
attired
in
black
silk
dresses
very
much
trimmed
they
had
an
air
of
the
highest
elegance
do
you
think
highly
of
this
pension
inquired
ruck
after
a
few
preliminaries
it
a
little
rough
but
it
seems
to
me
comfortable
i
answered
does
it
take
a
high
rank
in
geneva
ruck
pursued
i
imagine
it
enjoys
a
very
fair
fame
i
said
smiling
i
should
never
dream
of
comparing
it
to
a
new
york
said
ruck
it
quite
a
different
style
her
daughter
observed
miss
ruck
had
folded
her
arms
she
was
holding
her
elbows
with
a
pair
of
white
little
hands
and
she
was
tapping
the
ground
with
a
pretty
little
foot
we
hardly
expected
to
come
to
a
pension
said
ruck
but
we
thought
we
would
try
we
had
heard
so
much
about
swiss
pensions
i
was
saying
to
ruck
that
i
wondered
whether
this
was
a
favourable
specimen
i
was
afraid
we
might
have
made
a
mistake
we
knew
some
people
who
had
been
here
they
thought
everything
of
madame
beaurepas
said
miss
sophy
they
said
she
was
a
real
friend
and
parker
perhaps
you
have
heard
her
speak
of
them
ruck
pursued
madame
beaurepas
has
had
a
great
many
americans
she
is
very
fond
of
americans
i
replied
well
i
must
say
i
should
think
she
would
be
if
she
compares
them
with
some
others
mother
is
always
comparing
observed
miss
ruck
of
course
i
am
always
comparing
rejoined
the
elder
lady
i
never
had
a
chance
till
now
i
never
knew
my
privileges
give
me
an
american
and
ruck
indulged
in
a
little
laugh
well
i
must
say
there
are
some
things
i
like
over
here
said
miss
sophy
with
courage
and
indeed
i
could
see
that
she
was
a
young
woman
of
great
decision
you
like
the
shops
that
what
you
like
her
father
affirmed
the
young
lady
addressed
herself
to
me
without
heeding
this
remark
i
suppose
you
feel
quite
at
home
here
oh
he
likes
it
he
has
got
used
to
the
life
exclaimed
ruck
i
wish
you
teach
ruck
said
his
wife
it
seems
as
if
he
could
get
used
to
anything
i
used
to
you
my
dear
the
husband
retorted
giving
me
a
humorous
look
he
intensely
restless
continued
ruck
that
what
made
me
want
to
come
to
a
pension
i
thought
he
would
settle
down
more
i
do
think
i
am
used
to
you
after
all
said
her
husband
in
view
of
a
possible
exchange
of
conjugal
repartee
i
took
refuge
in
conversation
with
miss
ruck
who
seemed
perfectly
able
to
play
her
part
in
any
colloquy
i
learned
from
this
young
lady
that
with
her
parents
after
visiting
the
british
islands
she
had
been
spending
a
month
in
paris
and
that
she
thought
she
should
have
died
when
she
left
that
city
i
hung
out
of
the
carriage
when
we
left
the
hotel
said
miss
ruck
i
assure
you
i
did
and
mother
did
too
out
of
the
other
window
i
hope
said
i
yes
one
out
of
each
window
she
replied
promptly
father
had
hard
work
i
can
tell
you
we
had
half
finished
there
were
ever
so
many
places
we
wanted
to
go
to
your
father
insisted
on
coming
away
yes
after
we
had
been
there
about
a
month
he
said
he
had
enough
he
fearfully
restless
he
very
much
out
of
health
mother
and
i
said
to
him
that
if
he
was
restless
in
paris
he
need
hope
for
peace
anywhere
we
do
mean
to
leave
him
alone
till
he
takes
us
back
there
was
an
air
of
keen
resolution
in
miss
ruck
pretty
face
of
lucid
apprehension
of
desirable
ends
which
made
me
as
she
pronounced
these
words
direct
a
glance
of
covert
compassion
toward
her
poor
recalcitrant
father
he
had
walked
away
a
little
with
his
wife
and
i
saw
only
his
back
and
his
stooping
shoulders
whose
air
of
acute
resignation
was
thrown
into
relief
by
the
voluminous
tranquillity
of
ruck
he
will
have
to
take
us
back
in
september
any
way
the
young
girl
pursued
he
will
have
to
take
us
back
to
get
some
things
we
have
ordered
have
you
ordered
a
great
many
things
i
asked
jocosely
well
i
guess
we
have
ordered
some
of
course
we
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
being
in
paris
ladies
always
do
we
have
left
the
principal
things
till
we
go
back
of
course
that
is
the
principal
interest
for
ladies
mother
said
she
should
feel
so
shabby
if
she
just
passed
through
we
have
promised
all
the
people
to
be
back
in
september
and
i
never
broke
a
promise
yet
so
ruck
has
got
to
make
his
plans
accordingly
and
what
are
his
plans
i
do
know
he
does
seem
able
to
make
any
his
great
idea
was
to
get
to
geneva
but
now
that
he
has
got
here
he
does
seem
to
care
it
the
effect
of
ill
health
he
used
to
be
so
bright
but
now
he
is
quite
subdued
it
about
time
he
should
improve
any
way
we
went
out
last
night
to
look
at
the
jewellers
windows
in
that
street
behind
the
hotel
i
had
always
heard
of
those
windows
we
saw
some
lovely
things
but
it
did
seem
to
rouse
father
he
get
tired
of
geneva
sooner
than
he
did
of
paris
ah
said
i
there
are
finer
things
here
than
the
windows
we
are
very
near
some
of
the
most
beautiful
scenery
in
europe
i
suppose
you
mean
the
mountains
well
we
have
seen
plenty
of
mountains
at
home
we
used
to
go
to
the
mountains
every
summer
we
are
familiar
enough
with
the
mountains
are
we
mother
the
young
lady
demanded
appealing
to
ruck
who
with
her
husband
had
drawn
near
again
are
we
what
inquired
the
elder
lady
are
we
familiar
with
the
mountains
well
i
hope
so
said
ruck
ruck
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
gave
me
a
sociable
there
nothing
much
you
can
tell
them
he
said
the
two
ladies
stood
face
to
face
a
few
moments
surveying
each
other
garments
do
you
want
to
go
out
the
young
girl
at
last
inquired
of
her
mother
well
i
think
we
had
better
we
have
got
to
go
up
to
that
place
to
what
place
asked
ruck
to
that
jeweller
to
that
big
one
they
all
seemed
big
enough
they
were
too
big
and
ruck
gave
me
another
wink
that
one
where
we
saw
the
blue
cross
said
his
daughter
oh
come
what
do
you
want
of
that
blue
cross
poor
ruck
demanded
she
wants
to
hang
it
on
a
black
velvet
ribbon
and
tie
it
round
her
neck
said
his
wife
a
black
velvet
ribbon
no
i
thank
you
cried
the
young
lady
do
you
suppose
i
would
wear
that
cross
on
a
black
velvet
ribbon
on
a
nice
little
gold
chain
if
you
please
a
little
narrow
gold
chain
like
an
that
the
proper
thing
for
that
blue
cross
i
know
the
sort
of
chain
i
mean
i
going
to
look
for
one
when
i
want
a
thing
said
miss
ruck
with
decision
i
can
generally
find
it
look
here
sophy
her
father
urged
you
do
want
that
blue
cross
i
do
want
it
i
happen
to
want
it
and
sophy
glanced
at
me
with
a
little
laugh
her
laugh
which
in
itself
was
pretty
suggested
that
there
were
various
relations
in
which
one
might
stand
to
miss
ruck
but
i
think
i
was
conscious
of
a
certain
satisfaction
in
not
occupying
the
paternal
one
do
worry
the
poor
child
said
her
mother
come
on
mother
said
miss
ruck
we
are
going
to
look
about
a
little
explained
the
elder
lady
to
me
by
way
of
taking
leave
i
know
what
that
means
remarked
ruck
as
his
companions
moved
away
he
stood
looking
at
them
a
moment
while
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
head
behind
and
stood
rubbing
it
a
little
with
a
movement
that
displaced
his
hat
i
may
remark
in
parenthesis
that
i
never
saw
a
hat
more
easily
displaced
than
mr
ruck
i
supposed
he
was
going
to
say
something
querulous
but
i
was
mistaken
ruck
was
unhappy
but
he
was
very
well
they
want
to
pick
up
something
he
said
that
the
principal
interest
for
ladies
chapter
iv
ruck
distinguished
me
as
the
french
say
he
honoured
me
with
his
esteem
and
as
the
days
elapsed
with
a
large
portion
of
his
confidence
sometimes
he
bored
me
a
little
for
the
tone
of
his
conversation
was
not
cheerful
tending
as
it
did
almost
exclusively
to
a
melancholy
dirge
over
the
financial
prostration
of
our
common
country
no
sir
business
in
the
united
states
is
not
what
it
once
was
he
found
occasion
to
remark
several
times
a
day
there
not
the
same
spring
there
not
the
same
hopeful
feeling
you
can
see
it
in
all
departments
he
used
to
sit
by
the
hour
in
the
little
garden
of
the
pension
with
a
roll
of
american
newspapers
in
his
lap
and
his
high
hat
pushed
back
swinging
one
of
his
long
legs
and
reading
the
new
york
herald
he
paid
a
daily
visit
to
the
american
banker
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhone
and
remained
there
a
long
time
turning
over
the
old
papers
on
the
green
velvet
table
in
the
middle
of
the
salon
des
etrangers
and
fraternising
with
chance
compatriots
but
in
spite
of
these
diversions
his
time
hung
heavily
upon
his
hands
i
used
sometimes
to
propose
to
him
to
take
a
walk
but
he
had
a
mortal
horror
of
pedestrianism
and
regarded
my
own
taste
for
it
as
a
morbid
form
of
activity
you
kill
yourself
if
you
do
look
out
he
said
walking
all
over
the
country
i
do
want
to
walk
round
that
way
i
ai
a
postman
briefly
speaking
ruck
had
few
resources
his
wife
and
daughter
on
the
other
hand
it
was
to
be
supposed
were
possessed
of
a
good
many
that
could
not
be
apparent
to
an
unobtrusive
young
man
they
also
sat
a
great
deal
in
the
garden
or
in
the
salon
side
by
side
with
folded
hands
contemplating
material
objects
and
were
remarkably
independent
of
most
of
the
usual
feminine
aids
to
idleness
light
literature
tapestry
the
use
of
the
piano
they
were
however
much
fonder
of
locomotion
than
their
companion
and
i
often
met
them
in
the
rue
du
rhone
and
on
the
quays
loitering
in
front
of
the
jewellers
windows
they
might
have
had
a
cavalier
in
the
person
of
old
pigeonneau
who
possessed
a
high
appreciation
of
their
charms
but
who
owing
to
the
absence
of
a
common
idiom
was
deprived
of
the
pleasures
of
intimacy
he
knew
no
english
and
ruck
and
her
daughter
had
as
it
seemed
an
incurable
mistrust
of
the
beautiful
tongue
which
as
the
old
man
endeavoured
to
impress
upon
them
was
the
language
of
conversation
they
have
a
tournure
de
princesse
a
distinction
supreme
he
said
to
me
one
is
surprised
to
find
them
in
a
little
pension
at
seven
francs
a
day
oh
they
do
come
for
economy
i
answered
they
must
be
rich
they
do
come
for
my
beaux
yeux
for
mine
said
pigeonneau
sadly
perhaps
it
for
yours
young
man
je
vous
recommande
la
mere
i
reflected
a
moment
they
came
on
account
of
ruck
because
at
hotels
he
so
restless
pigeonneau
gave
me
a
knowing
nod
of
course
he
is
with
such
a
wife
as
that
a
femme
superbe
madame
ruck
is
preserved
in
perfection
a
miraculous
fraicheur
i
like
those
large
fair
quiet
women
they
are
often
dans
the
most
agreeable
warrant
you
that
at
heart
madame
ruck
is
a
finished
coquette
i
rather
doubt
it
i
said
you
suppose
her
cold
ne
vous
y
fiez
pas
it
is
a
matter
in
which
i
have
nothing
at
stake
you
young
americans
are
droll
said
pigeonneau
you
never
have
anything
at
stake
but
the
little
one
for
example
i
warrant
you
she
not
cold
she
is
admirably
made
she
is
very
pretty
is
very
pretty
vous
dites
cela
ton
when
you
pay
compliments
to
mademoiselle
ruck
i
hope
that
not
the
way
you
do
it
i
do
pay
compliments
to
mademoiselle
ruck
ah
decidedly
said
pigeonneau
you
young
americans
are
droll
i
should
have
suspected
that
these
two
ladies
would
not
especially
commend
themselves
to
madame
beaurepas
that
as
a
maitresse
de
salon
which
she
in
some
degree
aspired
to
be
she
would
have
found
them
wanting
in
a
certain
flexibility
of
deportment
but
i
should
have
gone
quite
wrong
madame
beaurepas
had
no
fault
at
all
to
find
with
her
new
pensionnaires
i
have
no
observation
whatever
to
make
about
them
she
said
to
me
one
evening
i
see
nothing
in
those
ladies
which
is
at
all
deplace
they
do
complain
of
anything
they
meddle
they
take
what
given
them
they
leave
me
tranquil
the
americans
are
often
like
that
often
but
not
always
madame
beaurepas
pursued
we
are
to
have
a
specimen
of
a
very
different
sort
an
american
i
inquired
two
americaines
a
mother
and
a
daughter
there
are
americans
and
americans
when
you
are
difficiles
you
are
more
so
than
any
one
and
when
you
have
pretensions
ah
per
exemple
it
serious
i
foresee
that
with
this
little
lady
everything
will
be
serious
beginning
with
her
cafe
au
lait
she
has
been
staying
at
the
pension
chamousset
my
concurrent
you
know
farther
up
the
street
but
she
is
coming
away
because
the
coffee
is
bad
she
holds
to
her
coffee
it
appears
i
do
know
what
liquid
madame
chamousset
may
have
invented
but
we
will
do
the
best
we
can
for
her
only
i
know
she
will
make
me
des
histoires
about
something
else
she
will
demand
a
new
lamp
for
the
salon
vous
alles
voir
cela
she
wishes
to
pay
but
eleven
francs
a
day
for
herself
and
her
daughter
tout
compris
and
for
their
eleven
francs
they
expect
to
be
lodged
like
princesses
but
she
is
very
is
that
what
you
call
it
in
english
oh
pour
cela
she
is
ladylike
i
caught
a
glimpse
on
the
morrow
of
this
ladylike
person
who
was
arriving
at
her
new
residence
as
i
came
in
from
a
walk
she
had
come
in
a
cab
with
her
daughter
and
her
luggage
and
with
an
air
of
perfect
softness
and
serenity
she
was
disputing
the
fare
as
she
stood
among
her
boxes
on
the
steps
she
addressed
her
cabman
in
a
very
english
accent
but
with
extreme
precision
and
correctness
i
wish
to
be
perfectly
reasonable
but
i
do
wish
to
encourage
you
in
exorbitant
demands
with
a
franc
and
a
half
you
are
sufficiently
paid
it
is
not
the
custom
at
geneva
to
give
a
for
so
short
a
drive
i
have
made
inquiries
and
i
find
it
is
not
the
custom
even
in
the
best
families
i
am
a
stranger
yes
but
i
always
adopt
the
custom
of
the
native
families
i
think
it
my
duty
toward
the
natives
but
i
am
a
native
too
moi
said
the
cabman
with
an
angry
laugh
you
seem
to
me
to
speak
with
a
german
accent
continued
the
lady
you
are
probably
from
basel
a
franc
and
a
half
is
sufficient
i
see
you
have
left
behind
the
little
red
bag
which
i
asked
you
to
hold
between
your
knees
you
will
please
to
go
back
to
the
other
house
and
get
it
very
well
if
you
are
impolite
i
will
make
a
complaint
of
you
at
the
administration
aurora
you
will
find
a
pencil
in
the
outer
pocket
of
my
embroidered
satchel
please
to
write
down
his
number
do
you
see
it
distinctly
in
case
we
should
forget
it
the
young
lady
addressed
as
aurora
a
slight
fair
girl
holding
a
large
parcel
of
umbrellas
stood
at
hand
while
this
allocution
went
forward
but
she
apparently
gave
no
heed
to
it
she
stood
looking
about
her
in
a
listless
manner
at
the
front
of
the
house
at
the
corridor
at
celestine
tucking
up
her
apron
in
the
doorway
at
me
as
i
passed
in
amid
the
disseminated
luggage
her
mother
parsimonious
attitude
seeming
to
produce
in
miss
aurora
neither
sympathy
nor
embarrassment
at
dinner
the
two
ladies
were
placed
on
the
same
side
of
the
table
as
myself
below
ruck
and
her
daughter
my
own
position
being
on
the
right
of
ruck
i
had
therefore
little
observation
of
church
such
i
learned
to
be
her
name
but
i
occasionally
heard
her
soft
distinct
voice
white
wine
if
you
please
we
prefer
white
wine
there
is
none
on
the
table
then
you
will
please
to
get
some
and
to
remember
to
place
a
bottle
of
it
always
here
between
my
daughter
and
myself
that
lady
seems
to
know
what
she
wants
said
ruck
and
she
speaks
so
i
can
understand
her
i
ca
understand
every
one
over
here
i
should
like
to
make
that
lady
acquaintance
perhaps
she
knows
what
want
too
it
seems
hard
to
find
out
but
i
want
any
of
their
sour
white
wine
that
one
of
the
things
i
want
i
expect
she
be
an
addition
to
the
pension
ruck
made
the
acquaintance
of
church
that
evening
in
the
parlour
being
presented
to
her
by
his
wife
who
presumed
on
the
rights
conferred
upon
herself
by
the
mutual
proximity
at
table
of
the
two
ladies
i
suspected
that
in
church
view
ruck
presumed
too
far
the
fugitive
from
the
pension
chamousset
as
pigeonneau
called
her
was
a
little
fresh
plump
comely
woman
looking
less
than
her
age
with
a
round
bright
serious
face
she
was
very
simply
and
frugally
dressed
not
at
all
in
the
manner
of
ruck
companions
and
she
had
an
air
of
quiet
distinction
which
was
an
excellent
defensive
weapon
she
exhibited
a
polite
disposition
to
listen
to
what
ruck
might
have
to
say
but
her
manner
was
equivalent
to
an
intimation
that
what
she
valued
least
in
house
life
was
its
social
opportunities
she
had
placed
herself
near
a
lamp
after
carefully
screwing
it
and
turning
it
up
and
she
had
opened
in
her
lap
with
the
assistance
of
a
large
embroidered
marker
an
octavo
volume
which
i
perceived
to
be
in
german
to
ruck
and
her
daughter
she
was
evidently
a
puzzle
with
her
economical
attire
and
her
expensive
culture
the
two
younger
ladies
however
had
begun
to
fraternise
very
freely
and
miss
ruck
presently
went
wandering
out
of
the
room
with
her
arm
round
the
waist
of
miss
church
it
was
a
very
warm
evening
the
long
windows
of
the
salon
stood
wide
open
into
the
garden
and
inspired
by
the
balmy
darkness
pigeonneau
and
mademoiselle
beaurepas
a
most
obliging
little
woman
who
lisped
and
always
wore
a
huge
cravat
declared
they
would
organise
a
fete
de
nuit
they
engaged
in
this
undertaking
and
the
fete
developed
itself
consisting
of
red
paper
lanterns
hung
about
on
the
trees
and
of
several
glasses
of
sirop
carried
on
a
tray
by
the
celestine
as
the
festival
deepened
to
its
climax
i
went
out
into
the
garden
where
pigeonneau
was
master
of
ceremonies
but
where
are
those
charming
young
ladies
he
cried
miss
ruck
and
the
transfuge
their
absence
has
been
remarked
and
they
are
wanting
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
occasion
voyez
i
have
selected
a
glass
of
syrup
a
generous
glass
for
mademoiselle
ruck
and
i
advise
you
my
young
friend
if
you
wish
to
make
a
good
impression
to
put
aside
one
which
you
may
offer
to
the
other
young
lady
what
is
her
name
miss
church
i
see
it
a
singular
name
there
is
a
church
in
which
i
would
willingly
worship
ruck
presently
came
out
of
the
salon
having
concluded
his
interview
with
church
through
the
open
window
i
saw
the
latter
lady
sitting
under
the
lamp
with
her
german
octavo
while
ruck
established
in
an
near
her
gazed
at
her
with
an
air
of
fascination
well
i
told
you
she
would
know
what
i
want
said
ruck
she
says
i
want
to
go
up
to
appenzell
wherever
that
is
that
i
want
to
drink
whey
and
live
in
a
high
latitude
what
did
she
call
it
a
high
altitude
she
seemed
to
think
we
ought
to
leave
for
appenzell
morrow
she
got
it
all
fixed
she
says
this
ai
a
high
enough
lat
a
high
enough
altitude
and
she
says
i
must
go
too
high
either
that
would
be
just
as
bad
she
seems
to
know
just
the
right
figure
she
says
she
give
me
a
list
of
the
hotels
where
we
must
stop
on
the
way
to
appenzell
i
asked
her
if
she
did
want
to
go
with
as
but
she
says
she
rather
sit
still
and
read
i
expect
she
a
big
reader
the
daughter
of
this
accomplished
woman
now
reappeared
in
company
with
miss
ruck
with
whom
she
had
been
strolling
through
the
outlying
parts
of
the
garden
well
said
miss
ruck
glancing
at
the
red
paper
lanterns
are
they
trying
to
stick
the
into
the
trees
it
an
illumination
in
honour
of
our
arrival
the
other
young
girl
rejoined
it
a
triumph
over
madame
chamousset
meanwhile
at
the
pension
chamousset
i
ventured
to
suggest
they
have
put
out
their
lights
they
are
sitting
in
darkness
lamenting
your
departure
she
looked
at
me
smiling
she
was
standing
in
the
light
that
came
from
the
house
pigeonneau
meanwhile
who
had
been
awaiting
his
chance
advanced
to
miss
ruck
with
his
glass
of
syrup
i
have
kept
it
for
you
mademoiselle
he
said
i
have
jealously
guarded
it
it
is
very
delicious
miss
ruck
looked
at
him
and
his
syrup
without
any
motion
to
take
the
glass
well
i
guess
it
sour
she
said
in
a
moment
and
she
gave
a
little
shake
of
her
head
pigeonneau
stood
staring
with
his
syrup
in
his
hand
then
he
slowly
turned
away
he
looked
about
at
the
rest
of
us
as
if
to
appeal
from
miss
ruck
insensibility
and
went
to
deposit
his
rejected
tribute
on
a
bench
wo
you
give
it
to
me
asked
miss
church
in
faultless
french
le
sirop
moi
pigeonneau
came
back
with
alacrity
and
presented
the
glass
with
a
very
low
bow
i
adore
good
manners
murmured
the
old
man
this
incident
caused
me
to
look
at
miss
church
with
quickened
interest
she
was
not
strikingly
pretty
but
in
her
charming
irregular
face
there
was
something
brilliant
and
ardent
like
her
mother
she
was
very
simply
dressed
she
wants
to
go
to
america
and
her
mother
wo
let
her
said
miss
sophy
to
me
explaining
her
companion
situation
i
am
very
sorry
for
america
i
answered
laughing
well
i
do
want
to
say
anything
against
your
mother
but
i
think
it
shameful
miss
ruck
pursued
mamma
has
very
good
reasons
she
will
tell
you
them
all
well
i
sure
i
do
want
to
hear
them
said
miss
ruck
you
have
got
a
right
to
go
to
your
own
country
every
one
has
a
right
to
go
to
their
own
country
mamma
is
not
very
patriotic
said
aurora
church
smiling
well
i
call
that
dreadful
her
companion
declared
i
have
heard
that
there
are
some
americans
like
that
but
i
never
believed
it
there
are
all
sorts
of
americans
i
said
laughing
aurora
one
of
the
right
sort
rejoined
miss
ruck
who
had
apparently
become
very
intimate
with
her
new
friend
are
you
very
patriotic
i
asked
of
the
young
girl
she
right
down
homesick
said
miss
sophy
she
dying
to
go
if
i
were
you
my
mother
would
have
to
take
me
mamma
is
going
to
take
me
to
dresden
well
i
declare
i
never
heard
of

so
dreadful
cried
miss
ruck
it
like
something
in
a
story
i
never
heard
there
was
anything
very
dreadful
in
dresden
i
interposed
miss
ruck
looked
at
me
a
moment
well
i
do
believe
you
are
a
good
american
she
replied
and
i
never
supposed
you
were
you
had
better
go
in
there
and
talk
to
mrs
church
dresden
is
really
very
nice
is
it
i
asked
of
her
companion
it
is
nice
if
you
happen
to
prefer
new
york
said
miss
sophy
miss
church
prefers
new
york
tell
him
you
are
dying
to
see
new
york
it
will
make
him
angry
she
went
on
i
have
no
desire
to
make
him
angry
said
aurora
smiling
it
is
only
miss
ruck
who
can
do
that
i
rejoined
have
you
been
a
long
time
in
europe
always
i
call
that
wicked
miss
sophy
declared
you
might
be
in
a
worse
place
i
continued
i
find
europe
very
interesting
miss
ruck
gave
a
little
laugh
i
was
saying
that
you
wanted
to
pass
for
a
european
yes
i
want
to
pass
for
a
dalmatian
miss
ruck
looked
at
me
a
moment
well
you
had
better
not
come
home
she
said
no
one
will
speak
to
you
were
you
born
in
these
countries
i
asked
of
her
companion
oh
no
i
came
to
europe
when
i
was
a
small
child
but
i
remember
america
a
little
and
it
seems
delightful
wait
till
you
see
it
again
it
just
too
lovely
said
miss
sophy
it
the
grandest
country
in
the
world
i
added
miss
ruck
began
to
toss
her
head
come
away
my
dear
she
said
if
there
a
creature
i
despise
it
a
man
that
tries
to
say
funny
things
about
his
own
country
do
you
think
one
can
be
tired
of
europe
aurora
asked
lingering
possibly
after
many
years
father
was
tired
of
it
after
three
weeks
said
miss
ruck
i
have
been
here
sixteen
years
her
friend
went
on
looking
at
me
with
a
charming
intentness
as
if
she
had
a
purpose
in
speaking
it
used
to
be
for
my
education
i
do
know
what
it
for
now
she
beautifully
educated
said
miss
ruck
she
knows
four
languages
i
am
not
very
sure
that
i
know
english
you
should
go
to
boston
cried
miss
sophy
they
speak
splendidly
in
boston
mon
reve
said
aurora
still
looking
at
me
have
you
been
all
over
europe
i
asked
in
all
the
different
countries
she
hesitated
a
moment
everywhere
that
there
a
pension
mamma
is
devoted
to
pensions
we
have
lived
at
one
time
or
another
in
every
pension
in
europe
well
i
should
think
you
had
seen
about
enough
said
miss
ruck
it
a
delightful
way
of
seeing
europe
aurora
rejoined
with
her
brilliant
smile
you
may
imagine
how
it
has
attached
me
to
the
different
countries
i
have
such
charming
souvenirs
there
is
a
pension
awaiting
us
now
at
dresden
eight
francs
a
day
without
wine
that
rather
dear
mamma
means
to
make
them
give
us
wine
mamma
is
a
great
authority
on
pensions
she
is
known
that
way
all
over
europe
last
winter
we
were
in
italy
and
she
discovered
one
at
piacenza
four
francs
a
day
we
made
economies
your
mother
does
seem
to
mingle
much
observed
miss
ruck
glancing
through
the
window
at
the
scholastic
attitude
of
church
no
she
does
mingle
except
in
the
native
society
though
she
lives
in
pensions
she
detests
them
why
does
she
live
in
them
then
asked
miss
sophy
rather
resentfully
oh
because
we
are
so
poor
it
the
cheapest
way
to
live
we
have
tried
having
a
cook
but
the
cook
always
steals
mamma
used
to
set
me
to
watch
her
that
the
way
i
passed
my
jeunesse
my
belle
jeunesse
we
are
frightfully
poor
the
young
girl
went
on
with
the
same
strange
frankness
a
curious
mixture
of
girlish
grace
and
conscious
cynicism
nous
pas
le
sou
that
one
of
the
reasons
we
do
go
back
to
america
mamma
says
we
ca
afford
to
live
there
well
any
one
can
see
that
you
an
american
girl
miss
ruck
remarked
in
a
consolatory
manner
i
can
tell
an
american
girl
a
mile
off
you
got
the
american
style
i
afraid
i
have
the
american
toilette
said
aurora
looking
at
the
other
superior
splendour
well
your
dress
was
cut
in
france
any
one
can
see
that
yes
said
aurora
with
a
laugh
my
dress
was
cut
in
france
at
avranches
well
you
got
a
lovely
figure
any
way
pursued
her
companion
ah
said
the
young
girl
at
avranches
too
my
figure
was
admired
and
she
looked
at
me
askance
with
a
certain
coquetry
but
i
was
an
innocent
youth
and
i
only
looked
back
at
her
wondering
she
was
a
great
deal
nicer
than
miss
ruck
and
yet
miss
ruck
would
not
have
said
that
i
try
to
be
like
an
american
girl
she
continued
i
do
my
best
though
mamma
does
at
all
encourage
it
i
am
very
patriotic
i
try
to
copy
them
though
mamma
has
brought
me
up
a
la
francaise
that
is
as
much
as
one
can
in
pensions
for
instance
i
have
never
been
out
of
the
house
without
mamma
oh
never
never
but
sometimes
i
despair
american
girls
are
so
wonderfully
frank
i
ca
be
frank
like
that
i
am
always
afraid
but
i
do
what
i
can
as
you
see
excusez
du
peu
i
thought
this
young
lady
at
least
as
outspoken
as
most
of
her
unexpatriated
sisters
there
was
something
almost
comical
in
her
despondency
but
she
had
by
no
means
caught
as
it
seemed
to
me
the
american
tone
whatever
her
tone
was
however
it
had
a
fascination
there
was
something
dainty
about
it
and
yet
it
was
decidedly
audacious
the
young
ladies
began
to
stroll
about
the
garden
again
and
i
enjoyed
their
society
until
pigeonneau
festival
came
to
an
end
chapter
ruck
did
not
take
his
departure
for
appenzell
on
the
morrow
in
spite
of
the
eagerness
to
witness
such
an
event
which
he
had
attributed
to
church
he
continued
on
the
contrary
for
many
days
after
to
hang
about
the
garden
to
wander
up
to
the
and
back
again
to
engage
in
desultory
conversation
with
his
boarders
and
to
endeavour
to
assuage
his
constitutional
restlessness
by
perusal
of
the
american
journals
but
on
the
morrow
i
had
the
honour
of
making
church
acquaintance
she
came
into
the
salon
after
the
midday
breakfast
with
her
german
octavo
under
her
arm
and
she
appealed
to
me
for
assistance
in
selecting
a
quiet
corner
would
you
very
kindly
she
said
move
that
large
fauteuil
a
little
more
this
way
not
the
largest
the
one
with
the
little
cushion
the
fauteuils
here
are
very
insufficient
i
must
ask
madame
beaurepas
for
another
thank
you
a
little
more
to
the
left
please
that
will
do
are
you
particularly
engaged
she
inquired
after
she
had
seated
herself
if
not
i
should
like
to
have
some
conversation
with
you
it
is
some
time
since
i
have
met
a
young
american
of
shall
i
call
it
your
affiliations
i
have
learned
your
name
from
madame
beaurepas
i
think
i
used
to
know
some
of
your
people
i
do
know
what
has
become
of
all
my
friends
i
used
to
have
a
charming
little
circle
at
home
but
now
i
meet
no
one
i
know
you
think
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
people
one
meets
and
the
people
one
would
like
to
meet
fortunately
sometimes
added
my
interlocutress
graciously
it
quite
the
same
i
suppose
you
are
a
specimen
a
favourable
specimen
she
went
on
of
young
america
tell
me
now
what
is
young
america
thinking
of
in
these
days
of
ours
what
are
its
feelings
its
opinions
its
aspirations
what
is
its
ideal
i
had
seated
myself
near
church
and
she
had
pointed
this
interrogation
with
the
gaze
of
her
bright
little
eyes
i
felt
it
embarrassing
to
be
treated
as
a
favourable
specimen
of
young
america
and
to
be
expected
to
answer
for
the
great
republic
observing
my
hesitation
church
clasped
her
hands
on
the
open
page
of
her
book
and
gave
an
intense
melancholy
smile
has
it
an
ideal
she
softly
asked
well
we
must
talk
of
this
she
went
on
without
insisting
speak
for
the
present
for
yourself
simply
have
you
come
to
europe
with
any
special
design
nothing
to
boast
of
i
said
i
am
studying
a
little
ah
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
gathering
up
a
little
european
culture
that
what
we
lack
you
know
at
home
no
individual
can
do
much
of
coarse
but
you
must
not
be
discouraged
every
little
counts
i
see
that
you
at
least
are
doing
your
part
i
rejoined
gallantly
dropping
my
eyes
on
my
companion
learned
volume
yes
i
frankly
admit
that
i
am
fond
of
study
there
is
no
one
after
all
like
the
germans
that
is
for
facts
for
opinions
i
by
no
means
always
go
with
them
i
form
my
opinions
myself
i
am
sorry
to
say
however
church
continued
that
i
can
hardly
pretend
to
diffuse
my
acquisitions
i
am
afraid
i
am
sadly
selfish
i
do
little
to
irrigate
the
soil
i
belong
i
frankly
confess
it
to
the
class
of
absentees
i
had
the
pleasure
last
evening
i
said
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
your
daughter
she
told
me
you
had
been
a
long
time
in
europe
church
smiled
benignantly
can
one
ever
be
too
long
we
shall
never
leave
it
your
daughter
wo
like
that
i
said
smiling
too
has
she
been
taking
you
into
her
confidence
she
is
a
more
sensible
young
lady
than
she
sometimes
appears
i
have
taken
great
pains
with
her
she
is
really
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
it
superbly
educated
she
seemed
to
me
a
very
charming
girl
i
rejoined
and
i
learned
that
she
speaks
four
languages
it
is
not
only
that
said
church
in
a
tone
which
suggested
that
this
might
be
a
very
superficial
species
of
culture
she
has
made
what
we
call
de
fortes
etudes
such
as
i
suppose
you
are
making
now
she
is
familiar
with
the
results
of
modern
science
she
keeps
pace
with
the
new
historical
school
ah
said
i
she
has
gone
much
farther
than
i
you
doubtless
think
i
exaggerate
and
you
force
me
therefore
to
mention
the
fact
that
i
am
able
to
speak
of
such
matters
with
a
certain
intelligence
that
is
very
evident
i
said
but
your
daughter
thinks
you
ought
to
take
her
home
i
began
to
fear
as
soon
as
i
had
uttered
these
words
that
they
savoured
of
treachery
to
the
young
lady
but
i
was
reassured
by
seeing
that
they
produced
on
her
mother
placid
countenance
no
symptom
whatever
of
irritation
my
daughter
has
her
little
theories
church
observed
she
has
i
may
say
her
illusions
and
what
wonder
what
would
youth
be
without
its
illusions
aurora
has
a
theory
that
she
would
be
happier
in
new
york
in
boston
in
philadelphia
than
in
one
of
the
charming
old
cities
in
which
our
lot
is
cast
but
she
is
mistaken
that
is
all
we
must
allow
our
children
their
illusions
must
we
not
but
we
must
watch
over
them
although
she
herself
seemed
proof
against
discomposure
i
found
something
vaguely
irritating
in
her
soft
sweet
positiveness
american
cities
i
said
are
the
paradise
of
young
girls
do
you
mean
asked
church
that
the
young
girls
who
come
from
those
places
are
angels
yes
i
said
resolutely
this
young
lady
what
is
her
odd
name
with
whom
my
daughter
has
formed
a
somewhat
precipitate
acquaintance
is
miss
ruck
an
angel
but
i
wo
force
you
to
say
anything
uncivil
it
would
be
too
cruel
to
make
a
single
exception
well
said
i
at
any
rate
in
america
young
girls
have
an
easier
lot
they
have
much
more
liberty
my
companion
laid
her
hand
for
an
instant
on
my
arm
my
dear
young
friend
i
know
america
i
know
the
conditions
of
life
there
so
well
there
is
perhaps
no
subject
on
which
i
have
reflected
more
than
on
our
national
idiosyncrasies
i
am
afraid
you
do
approve
of
them
said
i
a
little
brutally
brutal
indeed
my
proposition
was
and
church
was
not
prepared
to
assent
to
it
in
this
rough
shape
she
dropped
her
eyes
on
her
book
with
an
air
of
acute
meditation
then
raising
them
we
are
very
crude
she
softly
observed
we
are
very
crude
lest
even
this
statement
should
seem
to
savour
of
the
vice
that
she
deprecated
she
went
on
to
explain
there
are
two
classes
of
minds
you
know
those
that
hold
back
and
those
that
push
forward
my
daughter
and
i
are
not
pushers
we
move
with
little
steps
we
like
the
old
trodden
paths
we
like
the
old
old
world
ah
said
i
you
know
what
you
like
there
is
a
great
virtue
in
that
yes
we
like
europe
we
prefer
it
we
like
the
opportunities
of
europe
we
like
the
rest
there
is
so
much
in
that
you
know
the
world
seems
to
me
to
be
hurrying
pressing
forward
so
fiercely
without
knowing
where
it
is
going
i
often
ask
in
my
little
quiet
way
but
i
have
yet
to
learn
that
any
one
can
tell
me
you
a
great
conservative
i
observed
while
i
wondered
whether
i
myself
could
answer
this
inquiry
church
gave
me
a
smile
which
was
equivalent
to
a
confession
i
wish
to
retain
a
little
just
a
little
surely
we
have
done
so
much
we
might
rest
a
while
we
might
pause
that
is
all
my
to
stop
a
little
to
wait
i
have
seen
so
many
changes
i
wish
to
draw
in
to
draw
in
to
hold
back
to
hold
back
you
should
hold
your
daughter
back
i
answered
laughing
and
getting
up
i
got
up
not
by
way
of
terminating
our
interview
for
i
perceived
church
exposition
of
her
views
to
be
by
no
means
complete
but
in
order
to
offer
a
chair
to
miss
aurora
who
at
this
moment
drew
near
she
thanked
me
and
remained
standing
but
without
at
first
as
i
noticed
meeting
her
mother
eye
you
have
been
engaged
with
your
new
acquaintance
my
dear
this
lady
inquired
yes
mamma
dear
said
the
young
girl
gently
do
you
find
her
very
edifying
aurora
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
looked
at
her
mother
i
know
mamma
she
is
very
fresh
i
ventured
to
indulge
in
a
respectful
laugh
your
mother
has
another
word
for
that
but
i
must
not
i
added
be
crude
ah
vous
voulez
inquired
church
and
yet
i
pretend
i
said
it
in
jest
i
feel
it
too
much
we
have
been
having
a
little
social
discussion
she
said
to
her
daughter
there
is
still
so
much
to
be
said
and
i
wish
she
continued
turning
to
me
that
i
could
give
you
our
point
of
view
do
you
wish
aurora
that
we
could
give
him
our
point
of
view
yes
mamma
said
aurora
we
consider
ourselves
very
fortunate
in
our
point
of
view
do
we
dearest
mamma
demanded
very
fortunate
indeed
mamma
you
see
we
have
acquired
an
insight
into
european
life
the
elder
lady
pursued
we
have
our
place
at
many
a
european
fireside
we
find
so
much
to
esteem
so
much
to
enjoy
do
we
not
my
daughter
so
very
much
mamma
the
young
girl
went
on
with
a
sort
of
inscrutable
submissiveness
i
wondered
at
it
it
offered
so
strange
a
contrast
to
the
mocking
freedom
of
her
tone
the
night
before
but
while
i
wondered
i
was
careful
not
to
let
my
perplexity
take
precedence
of
my
good
manners
i
do
know
what
you
ladies
may
have
found
at
european
firesides
i
said
but
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
what
you
have
left
there
church
got
up
to
acknowledge
my
compliment
we
have
spent
some
charming
hours
and
that
reminds
me
that
we
have
just
now
such
an
occasion
in
prospect
we
are
to
call
upon
some
genevese
friends
the
family
of
the
pasteur
galopin
they
are
to
go
with
us
to
the
old
library
at
the
hotel
de
ville
where
there
are
some
very
interesting
documents
of
the
period
of
the
reformation
we
are
promised
a
glimpse
of
some
manuscripts
of
poor
servetus
the
antagonist
and
victim
you
know
of
calvin
here
of
course
one
can
only
speak
of
calvin
under
one
breath
but
some
day
when
we
are
more
private
and
church
looked
round
the
room
i
will
give
you
my
view
of
him
i
think
it
has
a
touch
of
originality
aurora
is
familiar
with
are
you
not
my
daughter
familiar
with
my
view
of
calvin
yes
mamma
said
aurora
with
docility
while
the
two
ladies
went
to
prepare
for
their
visit
to
the
pasteur
galopin
chapter
vi
she
has
demanded
a
new
lamp
i
told
you
she
would
this
communication
was
made
me
by
madame
beaurepas
a
couple
of
days
later
and
she
has
asked
for
a
new
tapis
de
lit
and
she
has
requested
me
to
provide
celestine
with
a
pair
of
light
shoes
i
told
her
that
as
a
general
thing
cooks
are
not
shod
with
satin
that
poor
celestine
church
may
be
exacting
i
said
but
she
is
a
clever
little
woman
a
lady
who
pays
but
five
francs
and
a
half
should
be
too
clever
deplace
i
do
like
the
type
what
type
do
you
call
mrs
church
mon
dieu
said
madame
beaurepas
une
de
ces
mamans
comme
vous
en
avez
qui
promenent
leur
fille
she
is
trying
to
marry
her
daughter
i
do
think
she
of
that
sort
but
madame
beaurepas
shrewdly
held
to
her
idea
she
is
trying
it
in
her
own
way
she
does
it
very
quietly
she
does
want
an
american
she
wants
a
foreigner
and
she
wants
a
mari
serieux
but
she
is
travelling
over
europe
in
search
of
one
she
would
like
a
magistrate
a
magistrate
a
gros
bonnet
of
some
kind
a
professor
or
a
deputy
i
am
very
sorry
for
the
poor
girl
i
said
laughing
you
need
pity
her
too
much
she
a
sly
thing
ah
for
that
no
i
exclaimed
she
a
charming
girl
madame
beaurepas
gave
an
elderly
grin
she
has
hooked
you
eh
but
the
mother
wo
have
you
i
developed
my
idea
without
heeding
this
insinuation
she
a
charming
girl
but
she
is
a
little
odd
it
a
necessity
of
her
position
she
is
less
submissive
to
her
mother
than
she
has
to
pretend
to
be
that
in
it
to
make
her
life
possible
she
wishes
to
get
away
from
her
mother
continued
madame
beaurepas
she
wishes
to
courir
les
champs
she
wishes
to
go
to
america
her
native
country
precisely
and
she
will
certainly
go
i
hope
so
i
rejoined
some
fine
morning
or
evening
she
will
go
off
with
a
young
man
probably
with
a
young
american
allons
donc
said
i
with
disgust
that
will
be
quite
america
enough
pursued
my
cynical
hostess
i
have
kept
a
for
forty
years
i
have
seen
that
type
have
such
things
as
that
happened
chez
vous
i
asked
everything
has
happened
chez
moi
but
nothing
has
happened
more
than
once
therefore
this
wo
happen
here
it
will
be
at
the
next
place
they
go
to
or
the
next
besides
here
there
is
no
young
american
pour
la
partie
none
except
you
monsieur
you
are
susceptible
but
you
are
too
reasonable
it
lucky
for
you
i
am
reasonable
i
answered
it
thanks
to
that
fact
that
you
escape
a
scolding
one
morning
about
this
time
instead
of
coming
back
to
breakfast
at
the
pension
after
my
lectures
at
the
academy
i
went
to
partake
of
this
meal
with
a
at
an
ancient
in
the
collegiate
quarter
on
separating
from
my
friend
i
took
my
way
along
that
charming
public
walk
known
in
geneva
as
the
treille
a
shady
terrace
of
immense
elevation
overhanging
a
portion
of
the
lower
town
there
are
spreading
trees
and
benches
and
over
the
tiles
and
chimneys
of
the
ville
basse
there
is
a
view
of
the
alps
on
the
other
side
as
you
turn
your
back
to
the
view
the
promenade
is
overlooked
by
a
row
of
tall
hotels
the
dwellings
of
the
local
aristocracy
i
was
very
fond
of
the
place
and
often
resorted
to
it
to
stimulate
my
sense
of
the
picturesque
presently
as
i
lingered
there
on
this
occasion
i
became
aware
that
a
gentleman
was
seated
not
far
from
where
i
stood
with
his
back
to
the
alpine
chain
which
this
morning
was
brilliant
and
distinct
and
a
newspaper
unfolded
in
his
lap
he
was
not
reading
however
he
was
staring
before
him
in
gloomy
contemplation
i
do
know
whether
i
recognised
first
the
newspaper
or
its
proprietor
one
in
either
case
would
have
helped
me
to
identify
the
other
one
was
the
new
york
herald
the
other
of
course
was
ruck
as
i
drew
nearer
he
transferred
his
eyes
from
the
stony
masks
of
the
gray
old
houses
on
the
other
side
of
the
terrace
and
i
knew
by
the
expression
of
his
face
just
how
he
had
been
feeling
about
these
distinguished
abodes
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
their
proprietors
were
a
dusky
unsociable
company
plunging
their
roots
into
a
superfluous
past
i
endeavoured
therefore
as
i
sat
down
beside
him
to
suggest
something
more
impersonal
that
a
beautiful
view
of
the
alps
i
observed
yes
said
ruck
without
moving
i
examined
it
fine
thing
in
its
way
fine
thing
beauties
of
nature
that
sort
of
thing
we
came
up
on
purpose
to
look
at
it
your
ladies
then
have
been
with
you
yes
they
are
just
walking
round
they
awfully
restless
they
keep
saying
i
restless
but
i
as
quiet
as
a
sleeping
child
to
them
it
takes
he
added
in
a
moment
drily
the
form
of
shopping
are
they
shopping
now
well
if
they
ai
they
trying
to
they
told
me
to
sit
here
a
while
and
they
just
walk
round
i
generally
know
what
that
means
but
that
the
principal
interest
for
ladies
he
added
retracting
his
irony
we
thought
we
come
up
here
and
see
the
cathedral
church
seemed
to
think
it
a
dead
loss
that
we
should
see
the
cathedral
especially
as
we
had
seen
many
yet
and
i
had
to
come
up
to
the
banker
any
way
well
we
certainly
saw
the
cathedral
i
do
know
as
we
are
any
the
better
for
it
and
i
do
know
as
i
should
know
it
again
but
we
saw
it
any
way
i
do
know
as
i
should
want
to
go
there
regularly
but
i
suppose
it
will
give
us
in
conversation
a
kind
of
hold
on
church
eh
i
guess
we
want
something
of
that
kind
well
ruck
continued
i
stepped
in
at
the
banker
to
see
if
there
was
something
and
they
handed
me
out
a
herald
i
hope
the
herald
is
full
of
good
news
i
said
ca
say
it
is
bad
news
political
i
inquired
or
commercial
oh
hang
politics
it
business
sir
there
ai
any
business
it
all
gone
to
and
ruck
became
profane
nine
failures
in
one
day
what
do
you
that
i
hope
they
have
injured
you
i
said
well
they
have
helped
me
much
so
many
houses
on
fire
all
if
they
happen
to
take
place
in
your
own
street
they
increase
the
value
of
your
property
when
mine
catches
i
suppose
they
write
and
tell
me
one
of
these
days
when
they
got
nothing
else
to
do
i
did
get
a
blessed
letter
this
morning
i
suppose
they
think
i
having
such
a
good
time
over
here
it
a
pity
to
disturb
me
if
i
could
attend
to
business
for
about
half
an
hour
i
find
out
something
but
i
ca
and
it
no
use
talking
the
state
of
my
health
was
never
so
unsatisfactory
as
it
was
about
five
this
morning
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
that
i
said
and
i
recommend
you
strongly
not
to
think
of
business
i
do
ruck
replied
i
thinking
of
cathedrals
thinking
of
the
beauties
of
nature
come
he
went
on
turning
round
on
the
bench
and
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
parapet
i
think
of
those
mountains
over
there
they
are
pretty
certainly
ca
you
get
over
there
over
where
over
to
those
hills
do
they
run
a
train
right
up
you
can
go
to
chamouni
i
said
you
can
go
to
grindelwald
and
zermatt
and
fifty
other
places
you
ca
go
by
rail
but
you
can
drive
all
right
we
drive
and
not
in
a
concern
either
yes
chamouni
is
one
of
the
places
we
put
down
i
hope
there
are
a
few
nice
shops
in
chamouni
ruck
spoke
with
a
certain
quickened
emphasis
and
in
a
tone
more
explicitly
humorous
than
he
commonly
employed
i
thought
he
was
excited
and
yet
he
had
not
the
appearance
of
excitement
he
looked
like
a
man
who
has
simply
taken
in
the
face
of
disaster
a
sudden
somewhat
imaginative
resolution
not
to
worry
he
presently
twisted
himself
about
on
his
bench
again
and
began
to
watch
for
his
companions
well
they
are
walking
round
he
resumed
i
guess
they
hit
on
something
somewhere
and
they
got
a
carriage
waiting
outside
of
that
archway
too
they
seem
to
do
a
big
business
in
archways
here
do
they
they
like
to
have
a
carriage
to
carry
home
the
things
those
ladies
of
mine
then
they
sure
they
got
them
the
ladies
after
this
to
do
them
justice
were
not
very
long
in
appearing
they
came
toward
us
from
under
the
archway
to
which
ruck
had
somewhat
invidiously
alluded
slowly
and
with
a
rather
exhausted
step
and
expression
my
companion
looked
at
them
a
moment
as
they
advanced
they
tired
he
said
softly
when
they
tired
like
that
it
very
expensive
well
said
ruck
i
glad
you
had
some
company
her
husband
looked
at
her
in
silence
through
narrowed
eyelids
and
i
suspected
that
this
gracious
observation
on
the
lady
part
was
prompted
by
a
restless
conscience
miss
sophy
glanced
at
me
with
her
little
straightforward
air
of
defiance
it
would
have
been
more
proper
if
we
had
had
the
company
why
did
you
come
after
us
instead
of
sitting
there
she
asked
of
ruck
companion
i
was
told
by
your
father
i
explained
that
you
were
engaged
in
sacred
rites
miss
ruck
was
not
gracious
though
i
doubt
whether
it
was
because
her
conscience
was
better
than
her
mother
well
for
a
gentleman
there
is
nothing
so
sacred
as
society
replied
miss
ruck
in
the
manner
of
a
person
accustomed
to
giving
neat
retorts
i
suppose
you
refer
to
the
cathedral
said
her
mother
well
i
must
say
we
did
go
back
there
i
do
know
what
it
may
be
of
a
sunday
but
it
gave
me
a
chill
we
discovered
the
loveliest
little
observed
the
young
girl
with
a
serenity
that
was
superior
to
bravado
her
father
looked
at
her
a
while
then
turned
about
again
leaning
on
the
parapet
and
gazed
away
at
the
hills
well
it
was
certainly
cheap
said
ruck
also
contemplating
the
alps
we
are
going
to
chamouni
said
her
husband
you
have
any
occasion
for
lace
at
chamouni
well
i
glad
to
hear
you
have
decided
to
go
somewhere
rejoined
his
wife
i
do
want
to
be
a
fixture
at
a
you
can
wear
lace
anywhere
said
miss
ruck
if
you
pat
it
on
right
that
the
great
thing
with
lace
i
do
think
they
know
how
to
wear
lace
in
europe
i
know
how
i
mean
to
wear
mine
but
i
mean
to
keep
it
till
i
get
home
her
father
transferred
his
melancholy
gaze
to
her
appointed
little
person
there
was
a
great
deal
of
very
detail
in
miss
ruck
appearance
then
in
a
tone
of
voice
quite
out
of
consonance
with
his
facial
despondency
have
you
purchased
a
great
deal
he
inquired
i
have
purchased
enough
for
you
to
make
a
fuss
about
he
ca
make
a
fuss
about
that
said
ruck
well
you
see
declared
the
young
girl
with
a
little
sharp
laugh
but
her
father
went
on
in
the
same
tone
have
you
got
it
in
your
pocket
why
do
you
put
it
on
why
do
you
hang
it
round
you
i
hang
it
round
you
if
you
do
look
out
cried
miss
sophy
do
you
want
to
show
it
to
this
gentleman
ruck
continued
mercy
how
you
do
talk
about
that
lace
said
his
wife
well
i
want
to
be
lively
there
every
reason
for
it
we
going
to
chamouni
you
restless
that
what
the
matter
with
you
and
ruck
got
up
no
i
ai
said
her
husband
i
never
felt
so
quiet
i
feel
as
peaceful
as
a
little
child
ruck
who
had
no
sense
whatever
of
humour
looked
at
her
daughter
and
at
me
well
i
hope
you
improve
she
said
send
in
the
bills
ruck
went
on
rising
to
his
feet
hesitate
sophy
i
do
care
what
you
do
now
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
miss
ruck
joined
her
mother
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
and
we
followed
the
ladies
to
the
carriage
in
your
place
said
miss
sophy
to
her
father
i
would
talk
so
much
about
pennies
and
pounds
before
strangers
poor
ruck
appeared
to
feel
the
force
of
this
observation
which
in
the
consciousness
of
a
man
who
had
never
been
mean
could
hardly
fail
to
strike
a
responsive
chord
he
coloured
a
little
and
he
was
silent
his
companions
got
into
their
vehicle
the
front
seat
of
which
was
adorned
with
a
large
parcel
ruck
gave
the
parcel
a
little
poke
with
his
umbrella
and
then
turning
to
me
with
a
rather
grimly
penitential
smile
after
all
he
said
for
the
ladies
that
the
principal
interest
chapter
vii
old
pigeonneau
had
more
than
once
proposed
to
me
to
take
a
walk
but
i
had
hitherto
been
unable
to
respond
to
so
alluring
an
invitation
it
befell
however
one
afternoon
that
i
perceived
him
going
forth
upon
a
desultory
stroll
with
a
certain
lonesomeness
of
demeanour
that
attracted
my
sympathy
i
hastily
overtook
him
and
passed
my
hand
into
his
venerable
arm
a
proceeding
which
produced
in
the
good
old
man
so
jovial
a
sense
of
comradeship
that
he
ardently
proposed
we
should
bend
our
steps
to
the
english
garden
no
locality
less
festive
was
worthy
of
the
occasion
to
the
english
garden
accordingly
we
went
it
lay
beyond
the
bridge
beside
the
lake
it
was
very
pretty
and
very
animated
there
was
a
band
playing
in
the
middle
and
a
considerable
number
of
persons
sitting
under
the
small
trees
on
benches
and
little
chairs
or
strolling
beside
the
blue
water
we
joined
the
strollers
we
observed
our
companions
and
conversed
on
obvious
topics
some
of
these
last
of
course
were
the
pretty
women
who
embellished
the
scene
and
who
in
the
light
of
pigeonneau
comprehensive
criticism
appeared
surprisingly
numerous
he
seemed
bent
upon
our
making
up
our
minds
as
to
which
was
the
prettiest
and
as
this
was
an
innocent
game
i
consented
to
play
at
it
suddenly
pigeonneau
stopped
pressing
my
arm
with
the
liveliest
emotion
la
voila
la
voila
the
prettiest
he
quickly
murmured
coming
toward
us
in
a
blue
dress
with
the
other
it
was
at
the
other
i
was
looking
for
the
other
to
my
surprise
was
our
interesting
the
daughter
of
a
vigilant
mother
pigeonneau
meanwhile
had
redoubled
his
exclamations
he
had
recognised
miss
sophy
ruck
oh
la
belle
rencontre
nos
aimables
convives
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
world
in
effect
we
immediately
greeted
and
joined
the
young
ladies
who
like
ourselves
were
walking
arm
in
arm
and
enjoying
the
scene
i
was
citing
you
with
admiration
to
my
friend
even
before
i
had
recognised
you
said
pigeonneau
to
miss
ruck
i
do
believe
in
french
compliments
remarked
this
young
lady
presenting
her
back
to
the
smiling
old
man
are
you
and
miss
ruck
walking
alone
i
asked
of
her
companion
you
had
better
accept
of
pigeonneau
gallant
protection
and
of
mine
aurora
church
had
taken
her
hand
out
of
miss
ruck
arm
she
looked
at
me
smiling
with
her
head
a
little
inclined
while
upon
her
shoulder
she
made
her
open
parasol
revolve
which
is
most
improper
to
walk
alone
or
to
walk
with
gentlemen
i
wish
to
do
what
is
most
improper
what
mysterious
logic
governs
your
conduct
i
inquired
he
thinks
you
ca
understand
him
when
he
talks
like
that
said
miss
ruck
but
i
do
understand
you
always
so
i
have
always
ventured
to
hope
my
dear
miss
ruck
well
if
i
did
it
would
be
much
loss
rejoined
this
young
lady
allons
en
marche
cried
pigeonneau
smiling
still
and
undiscouraged
by
her
inhumanity
let
as
make
together
the
tour
of
the
garden
and
he
imposed
his
society
upon
miss
ruck
with
a
respectful
elderly
grace
which
was
evidently
unable
to
see
anything
in
her
reluctance
but
modesty
and
was
sublimely
conscious
of
a
mission
to
place
modesty
at
its
ease
this
couple
walked
in
front
while
aurora
church
and
i
strolled
along
together
i
am
sure
this
is
more
improper
said
my
companion
this
is
delightfully
improper
i
do
say
that
as
a
compliment
to
you
she
added
i
would
say
it
to
any
man
no
matter
how
stupid
oh
i
am
very
stupid
i
answered
but
this
does
seem
to
me
wrong
not
for
you
no
only
for
me
there
is
nothing
that
a
man
can
do
that
is
wrong
is
there
en
morale
you
know
i
mean
ah
yes
he
can
steal
but
i
think
there
is
nothing
else
is
there
i
do
know
one
does
know
those
things
until
after
one
has
done
them
then
one
is
enlightened
and
you
mean
that
you
have
never
been
enlightened
you
make
yourself
out
very
good
that
is
better
than
making
one
self
out
bad
as
you
do
the
young
girl
glanced
at
me
a
moment
and
then
with
her
charming
smile
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
a
false
position
is
your
position
false
i
inquired
smiling
too
at
this
large
formula
distinctly
so
in
what
way
oh
in
every
way
for
instance
i
have
to
pretend
to
be
a
jeune
fille
i
am
not
a
jeune
fille
no
american
girl
is
a
jeune
fille
an
american
girl
is
an
intelligent
responsible
creature
i
have
to
pretend
to
be
very
innocent
but
i
am
not
very
innocent
you
do
pretend
to
be
very
innocent
you
pretend
to
be
what
shall
i
call
it
very
wise
that
no
pretence
i
am
wise
you
are
not
an
american
girl
i
ventured
to
observe
my
companion
almost
stopped
looking
at
me
there
was
a
little
flush
in
her
cheek
voila
she
said
there
my
false
position
i
want
to
be
an
american
girl
and
i
not
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
i
went
on
an
american
girl
talk
as
you
are
talking
now
please
tell
me
said
aurora
church
with
expressive
eagerness
how
would
she
talk
i
ca
tell
you
all
the
things
an
american
girl
would
say
but
i
think
i
can
tell
you
the
things
she
would
say
she
reason
out
her
conduct
as
you
seem
to
me
to
do
aurora
gave
me
the
most
flattering
attention
i
see
she
would
be
simpler
to
do
very
simple
things
that
are
not
at
all
simple
that
is
the
american
girl
i
permitted
myself
a
small
explosion
of
hilarity
i
do
know
whether
you
are
a
french
girl
or
what
you
are
i
said
but
you
are
very
witty
ah
you
mean
that
i
strike
false
notes
cried
aurora
church
sadly
that
just
what
i
want
to
avoid
i
wish
you
would
always
tell
me
the
conversational
union
between
miss
ruck
and
her
neighbour
in
front
of
us
had
evidently
not
become
a
close
one
the
young
lady
suddenly
turned
round
to
us
with
a
question
do
you
want
some
she
does
strike
false
notes
i
murmured
there
was
a
kind
of
pavilion
or
kiosk
which
served
as
a
cafe
and
at
which
the
delicacies
procurable
at
such
an
establishment
were
dispensed
miss
ruck
pointed
to
the
little
green
tables
and
chairs
which
were
set
out
on
the
gravel
pigeonneau
fluttering
with
a
sense
of
dissipation
seconded
the
proposal
and
we
presently
sat
down
and
gave
our
order
to
a
nimble
attendant
i
managed
again
to
place
myself
next
to
aurora
church
our
companions
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
my
neighbour
was
delighted
with
our
situation
this
is
best
of
all
she
said
i
never
believed
i
should
come
to
a
cafe
with
two
strange
men
now
you
ca
persuade
me
this
is
wrong
to
make
it
wrong
we
ought
to
see
your
mother
coming
down
that
path
ah
my
mother
makes
everything
wrong
said
the
young
girl
attacking
with
a
little
spoon
in
the
shape
of
a
spade
the
apex
of
a
pink
ice
and
then
she
returned
to
her
idea
of
a
moment
before
you
must
promise
to
tell
me
to
warn
me
in
some
way
whenever
i
strike
a
false
note
you
must
give
a
little
cough
like
that
ahem
you
will
keep
me
very
busy
and
people
will
think
i
am
in
a
consumption
voyons
she
continued
why
have
you
never
talked
to
me
more
is
that
a
false
note
why
have
you
been
that
what
american
girls
call
it
that
what
miss
ruck
calls
it
i
assured
myself
that
our
companions
were
out
of
earshot
and
that
miss
ruck
was
much
occupied
with
a
large
vanilla
cream
because
you
are
always
entwined
with
that
young
lady
there
is
no
getting
near
you
aurora
looked
at
her
friend
while
the
latter
devoted
herself
to
her
ice
you
wonder
why
i
like
her
so
much
i
suppose
so
does
mamma
elle
perd
i
do
like
her
particularly
je
suis
pas
folle
but
she
gives
me
information
she
tells
me
about
america
mamma
has
always
tried
to
prevent
my
knowing
anything
about
it
and
i
am
all
the
more
curious
and
then
miss
ruck
is
very
fresh
i
may
not
be
so
fresh
as
miss
ruck
i
said
but
in
future
when
you
want
information
i
recommend
you
to
come
to
me
for
it
our
friend
offers
to
take
me
to
america
she
invites
me
to
go
back
with
her
to
stay
with
her
you
could
do
that
could
you
and
the
young
girl
looked
at
me
a
moment
bon
a
false
note
i
can
see
it
by
your
face
you
remind
me
of
a
maitre
de
piano
you
overdo
the
character
the
poor
american
girl
i
said
are
you
going
to
stay
with
that
delightful
family
i
will
go
and
stay
with
any
one
that
will
take
me
or
ask
me
it
a
real
nostalgie
she
says
that
in
new
york
in
should
have
the
most
lovely
time
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
enjoy
it
absolute
liberty
to
begin
with
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
certain
liberty
here
i
rejoined
ah
this
oh
i
shall
pay
for
this
i
shall
be
punished
by
mamma
and
i
shall
be
lectured
by
madame
galopin
the
wife
of
the
pasteur
his
digne
epouse
madame
galopin
for
mamma
is
the
incarnation
of
european
opinion
that
what
vexes
me
with
mamma
her
thinking
so
much
of
people
like
madame
galopin
going
to
see
madame
galopin
mamma
calls
that
being
in
european
society
european
society
so
sick
of
that
expression
i
have
heard
it
since
i
was
six
years
old
who
is
madame
galopin
who
thinks
anything
of
her
here
she
is
nobody
she
is
perfectly
if
i
like
america
better
than
mamma
i
also
know
europe
better
but
your
mother
certainly
i
objected
a
trifle
timidly
for
my
young
lady
was
excited
and
had
a
charming
little
passion
in
her
your
mother
has
a
great
many
social
relations
all
over
the
continent
she
thinks
so
but
half
the
people
do
care
for
us
they
are
not
so
good
as
we
and
they
know
it
i
do
them
that
justice
and
they
wonder
why
we
should
care
for
them
when
we
are
polite
to
them
they
think
the
less
of
us
there
are
plenty
of
people
like
that
mamma
thinks
so
much
of
them
simply
because
they
are
foreigners
if
i
could
tell
you
all
the
dull
stupid
people
i
have
had
to
talk
to
for
no
better
reason
than
that
they
were
de
leur
pays
germans
french
italians
turks
everything
when
i
complain
mamma
always
says
that
at
any
rate
it
practice
in
the
language
and
she
makes
so
much
of
the
english
too
i
do
know
what
that
practice
in
before
i
had
time
to
suggest
an
hypothesis
as
regards
this
latter
point
i
saw
something
that
made
me
rise
with
a
certain
solemnity
from
my
chair
this
was
nothing
less
than
the
neat
little
figure
of
church
a
perfect
model
of
the
femme
comme
il
faut
approaching
our
table
with
an
impatient
step
and
followed
most
unexpectedly
in
her
advance
by
the
form
of
ruck
she
had
evidently
come
in
quest
of
her
daughter
and
if
she
had
commanded
this
gentleman
attendance
it
had
been
on
no
softer
ground
than
that
of
his
unenvied
paternity
to
her
guilty
child
accomplice
my
movement
had
given
the
alarm
and
aurora
church
and
pigeonneau
got
up
miss
ruck
alone
did
not
in
the
local
phrase
derange
herself
church
beneath
her
modest
little
bonnet
looked
very
serious
but
not
at
all
fluttered
she
came
straight
to
her
daughter
who
received
her
with
a
smile
and
then
she
looked
all
round
at
the
rest
of
us
very
fixedly
and
tranquilly
without
bowing
i
must
do
both
these
ladies
the
justice
to
mention
that
neither
of
them
made
the
least
little
scene
i
have
come
for
you
dearest
said
the
mother
yes
dear
mamma
come
for
you
come
for
you
church
repeated
looking
down
at
the
relics
of
our
little
feast
i
was
obliged
to
ask
assistance
i
was
puzzled
i
thought
a
long
time
well
church
i
was
glad
to
see
you
puzzled
once
in
your
life
said
ruck
with
friendly
jocosity
but
you
came
pretty
straight
for
all
that
i
had
hard
work
to
keep
up
with
you
we
will
take
a
cab
aurora
church
went
on
without
heeding
this
pleasantry
a
closed
one
come
my
daughter
yes
dear
mamma
the
young
girl
was
blushing
yet
she
was
still
smiling
she
looked
round
at
us
all
and
as
her
eyes
met
mine
i
thought
she
was
beautiful
she
said
to
us
i
have
had
a
lovely
time
we
must
not
linger
said
her
mother
it
is
five
we
are
to
dine
you
know
with
madame
galopin
i
had
quite
forgotten
aurora
declared
that
will
be
charming
do
you
want
me
to
assist
you
to
carry
her
back
ma
am
asked
ruck
church
hesitated
a
moment
with
her
serene
little
gaze
do
you
prefer
then
to
leave
your
daughter
to
finish
the
evening
with
these
gentlemen
ruck
pushed
back
his
hat
and
scratched
the
top
of
his
head
well
i
do
know
how
would
you
like
that
sophy
well
i
never
exclaimed
sophy
as
church
marched
off
with
her
daughter
chapter
viii
i
had
half
expected
that
church
would
make
me
feel
the
weight
of
her
disapproval
of
my
own
share
in
that
little
act
of
revelry
in
the
english
garden
but
she
maintained
her
claim
to
being
a
highly
reasonable
woman
i
could
not
but
admire
the
justice
of
this
pretension
by
recognising
my
irresponsibility
i
had
taken
her
daughter
as
i
found
her
which
was
according
to
church
view
in
a
very
equivocal
position
the
natural
instinct
of
a
young
man
in
such
a
situation
is
not
to
protest
but
to
profit
and
it
was
clear
to
church
that
i
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
miss
appearing
in
public
under
the
insufficient
chaperonage
of
miss
ruck
besides
she
liked
to
converse
and
she
apparently
did
me
the
honour
to
believe
that
of
all
the
members
of
the
pension
beaurepas
i
had
the
most
cultivated
understanding
i
found
her
in
the
salon
a
couple
of
evenings
after
the
incident
i
have
just
narrated
and
i
approached
her
with
a
view
of
making
my
peace
with
her
if
this
should
prove
necessary
but
church
was
as
gracious
as
i
could
have
desired
she
put
her
marker
into
her
book
and
folded
her
plump
little
hands
on
the
cover
she
made
no
specific
allusion
to
the
english
garden
she
embarked
rather
upon
those
general
considerations
in
which
her
refined
intellect
was
so
much
at
home
always
at
your
studies
church
i
ventured
to
observe
que
to
say
studies
is
to
say
too
much
one
study
in
the
parlour
of
a
but
i
do
what
i
can
i
have
always
done
what
i
can
that
is
all
i
have
ever
claimed
no
one
can
do
more
and
you
seem
to
have
done
a
great
deal
do
you
know
my
secret
she
asked
with
an
air
of
brightening
confidence
and
she
paused
a
moment
before
she
imparted
her
secret
to
care
only
for
the
best
to
do
the
best
to
know
the
best
to
have
to
desire
to
recognise
only
the
best
that
what
i
have
always
done
in
my
quiet
little
way
i
have
gone
through
europe
on
my
devoted
little
errand
seeking
seeing
heeding
only
the
best
and
it
has
not
been
for
myself
alone
it
has
been
for
my
daughter
my
daughter
has
had
the
best
we
are
not
rich
but
i
can
say
that
she
has
had
you
madam
i
rejoined
finely
certainly
such
as
i
am
i
have
been
devoted
we
have
got
something
everywhere
a
little
here
a
little
there
that
the
real
secret
to
get
something
everywhere
you
always
can
if
you
are
devoted
sometimes
it
has
been
a
little
music
sometimes
a
little
deeper
insight
into
the
history
of
art
every
little
counts
you
know
sometimes
it
has
been
just
a
glimpse
a
view
a
lovely
landscape
an
impression
we
have
always
been
on
the
sometimes
it
has
been
a
valued
friendship
a
delightful
social
tie
here
comes
the
society
the
poor
daughter
bugbear
i
said
to
myself
certainly
i
remarked
aloud
i
admit
rather
perversely
if
you
have
lived
a
great
deal
in
pensions
you
must
have
got
acquainted
with
lots
of
people
church
dropped
her
eyes
a
moment
and
then
with
considerable
gravity
i
think
the
european
pension
system
in
many
respects
remarkable
and
in
some
satisfactory
but
of
the
friendships
that
we
have
formed
few
have
been
contracted
in
establishments
of
this
kind
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
i
said
laughing
i
do
say
it
for
you
though
i
might
say
it
for
some
others
we
have
been
interested
in
european
homes
oh
i
see
we
have
the
entree
of
the
old
genevese
society
i
like
its
tone
i
prefer
it
to
that
of
ruck
added
church
calmly
to
that
of
ruck
and
miss
ruck
of
miss
ruck
especially
ah
the
poor
rucks
have
any
tone
at
all
i
said
do
take
them
more
seriously
than
they
take
themselves
tell
me
this
my
companion
rejoined
are
they
fair
examples
examples
of
what
of
our
american
tendencies
is
a
big
word
dear
lady
tendencies
are
difficult
to
calculate
and
you
should
abuse
those
good
rucks
who
have
been
very
kind
to
your
daughter
they
have
invited
her
to
go
and
stay
with
them
in
street
aurora
has
told
me
it
might
be
very
serious
it
might
be
very
droll
i
said
to
me
declared
church
it
is
simply
terrible
i
think
we
shall
have
to
leave
the
pension
beaurepas
i
shall
go
back
to
madame
chamousset
on
account
of
the
rucks
i
asked
pray
why
do
they
go
themselves
i
have
given
them
some
excellent
addresses
written
down
the
very
hours
of
the
trains
they
were
going
to
appenzell
i
thought
it
was
arranged
they
talk
of
chamouni
now
i
said
but
they
are
very
helpless
and
undecided
i
will
give
them
some
chamouni
addresses
ruck
will
send
a
chaise
a
porteurs
i
will
give
her
the
name
of
a
man
who
lets
them
lower
than
you
get
them
at
the
hotels
after
that
they
must
go
well
i
doubt
i
observed
whether
ruck
will
ever
really
be
seen
on
the
mer
de
glace
in
a
high
hat
he
not
like
you
he
does
value
his
european
privileges
he
takes
no
interest
he
regrets
wall
street
acutely
as
his
wife
says
he
is
very
restless
but
he
has
no
curiosity
about
chamouni
so
you
must
not
depend
too
much
on
the
effect
of
your
addresses
is
it
a
frequent
type
asked
church
with
an
air
of
control
i
am
afraid
so
ruck
is
a
man
of
business
he
is
broken
down
in
health
and
i
suspect
he
is
broken
down
in
fortune
he
has
spent
his
whole
life
in
buying
and
selling
he
knows
how
to
do
nothing
else
his
wife
and
daughter
have
spent
their
lives
not
in
selling
but
in
buying
and
they
on
their
side
know
how
to
do
nothing
else
to
get
something
in
a
shop
that
they
can
put
on
their
backs
that
is
their
one
idea
they
have
another
in
their
heads
of
course
they
spend
no
end
of
money
and
they
do
it
with
an
implacable
persistence
with
a
mixture
of
audacity
and
of
cunning
they
do
it
in
his
teeth
and
they
do
it
behind
his
back
the
mother
protects
the
daughter
and
the
daughter
eggs
on
the
mother
between
them
they
are
bleeding
him
to
death
ah
what
a
picture
murmured
church
i
am
afraid
they
are
i
share
your
fears
they
are
perfectly
ignorant
they
have
no
resources
the
vision
of
fine
clothes
occupies
their
whole
imagination
they
have
not
an
idea
even
a
worse
one
to
compete
with
it
poor
ruck
who
is
extremely
and
soft
seems
to
me
a
really
tragic
figure
he
is
getting
bad
news
every
day
from
home
his
business
is
going
to
the
dogs
he
is
unable
to
stop
it
he
has
to
stand
and
watch
his
fortunes
ebb
he
has
been
used
to
doing
things
in
a
big
way
and
he
feels
mean
if
he
makes
a
fuss
about
bills
so
the
ladies
keep
sending
them
in
but
have
they
common
sense
do
they
know
they
are
ruining
themselves
they
do
believe
it
the
duty
of
an
american
husband
and
father
is
to
keep
them
going
if
he
asks
them
how
that
his
own
affair
so
by
way
of
not
being
mean
of
being
a
good
american
husband
and
father
poor
ruck
stands
staring
at
bankruptcy
church
looked
at
me
a
moment
in
quickened
meditation
why
if
aurora
were
to
go
to
stay
with
them
she
might
not
even
be
properly
fed
i
do
on
the
whole
recommend
i
said
laughing
that
your
daughter
should
pay
a
visit
to
street
why
should
i
be
subjected
to
such
trials
so
sadly
eprouvee
why
should
a
daughter
of
mine
like
that
dreadful
girl
does
she
like
her
pray
do
you
mean
asked
my
companion
softly
that
aurora
is
a
hypocrite
i
hesitated
a
moment
a
little
since
you
ask
me
i
think
you
have
forced
her
to
be
church
answered
this
possibly
presumptuous
charge
with
a
tranquil
candid
exultation
i
never
force
my
daughter
she
is
nevertheless
in
a
false
position
i
rejoined
she
hungers
and
thirsts
to
go
back
to
her
own
country
she
wants
come
out
in
new
york
which
is
certainly
socially
speaking
the
el
dorado
of
young
ladies
she
likes
any
one
for
the
moment
who
will
talk
to
her
of
that
and
serve
as
a
with
her
native
shores
miss
ruck
performs
this
agreeable
office
your
idea
is
then
that
if
she
were
to
go
with
miss
ruck
to
america
she
would
drop
her
afterwards
i
complimented
church
upon
her
logical
mind
but
i
repudiated
this
cynical
supposition
i
ca
imagine
her
when
it
should
come
to
the
point
embarking
with
the
famille
ruck
but
i
wish
she
might
go
nevertheless
church
shook
her
head
serenely
and
smiled
at
my
inappropriate
zeal
i
trust
my
poor
child
may
never
be
guilty
of
so
fatal
a
mistake
she
is
completely
in
error
she
is
wholly
unadapted
to
the
peculiar
conditions
of
american
life
it
would
not
please
her
she
would
not
sympathise
my
daughter
ideal
is
not
the
ideal
of
the
class
of
young
women
to
which
miss
ruck
belongs
i
fear
they
are
very
numerous
they
give
the
tone
they
give
the
tone
it
is
you
that
are
mistaken
i
said
go
home
for
six
months
and
see
i
have
not
unfortunately
the
means
to
make
costly
experiments
my
daughter
has
had
great
advantages
rare
advantages
and
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
believe
that
au
fond
she
does
not
appreciate
them
one
thing
is
certain
i
must
remove
her
from
this
pernicious
influence
we
must
part
company
with
this
deplorable
family
if
ruck
and
his
ladies
can
not
be
induced
to
go
to
chamouni
a
journey
that
no
traveller
with
the
smallest
would
omit
my
daughter
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
retire
we
shall
go
to
dresden
to
dresden
the
capital
of
saxony
i
had
arranged
to
go
there
for
the
autumn
but
it
will
be
simpler
to
go
immediately
there
are
several
works
in
the
gallery
with
which
my
daughter
has
not
i
think
sufficiently
familiarised
herself
it
is
especially
strong
in
the
seventeenth
century
schools
as
my
companion
offered
me
this
information
i
perceived
ruck
come
lounging
in
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
elbows
making
acute
angles
he
had
his
usual
anomalous
appearance
of
both
seeking
and
avoiding
society
and
he
wandered
obliquely
toward
church
whose
last
words
he
had
overheard
the
seventeenth
century
schools
he
said
slowly
as
if
he
were
weighing
some
very
small
object
in
a
very
of
scales
now
do
you
suppose
they
had
schools
at
that
period
church
rose
with
a
good
deal
of
precision
making
no
answer
to
this
incongruous
jest
she
clasped
her
large
volume
to
her
neat
little
bosom
and
she
fixed
a
gentle
serious
eye
upon
ruck
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
chamouni
she
said
well
replied
ruck
i
suppose
you
got
friends
all
over
i
have
friends
at
chamouni
but
they
are
leaving
to
their
great
regret
i
had
got
up
too
i
listened
to
this
statement
and
i
wondered
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
mention
the
subject
of
my
agitation
i
asked
myself
whether
this
was
a
sudden
improvisation
consecrated
by
maternal
devotion
but
this
point
has
never
been
elucidated
they
are
giving
up
some
charming
rooms
perhaps
you
would
like
them
i
would
suggest
your
telegraphing
the
weather
is
glorious
continued
church
and
the
highest
peaks
are
now
perceived
with
extraordinary
distinctness
ruck
listened
as
he
always
listened
respectfully
well
he
said
i
do
know
as
i
want
to
go
up
mount
blank
that
the
principal
attraction
is
it
there
are
many
others
i
thought
i
would
offer
you
an
an
exceptional
opportunity
well
said
ruck
you
right
down
friendly
but
i
seem
to
have
more
opportunities
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
i
do
seem
able
to
take
hold
it
only
needs
a
little
decision
remarked
church
with
an
air
which
was
an
admirable
example
of
this
virtue
i
wish
you
night
sir
and
she
moved
noiselessly
away
ruck
with
his
long
legs
apart
stood
staring
after
her
then
he
transferred
his
perfectly
quiet
eyes
to
me
does
she
own
a
hotel
over
there
he
asked
has
she
got
any
stock
in
mount
blank
chapter
ix
the
next
day
madame
beaurepas
handed
me
with
her
own
elderly
fingers
a
missive
which
proved
to
be
a
telegram
after
glancing
at
it
i
informed
her
that
it
was
apparently
a
signal
for
my
departure
my
brother
had
arrived
in
england
and
proposed
to
me
to
meet
him
there
he
had
come
on
business
and
was
to
spend
but
three
weeks
in
europe
but
my
house
empties
itself
cried
the
old
woman
the
famille
ruck
talks
of
leaving
me
and
madame
church
nous
fait
la
reverence
church
is
going
away
she
is
packing
her
trunk
she
is
a
very
extraordinary
person
do
you
know
what
she
asked
me
this
morning
to
invent
some
combination
by
which
the
famille
ruck
should
move
away
i
informed
her
that
i
was
not
an
inventor
that
poor
famille
ruck
me
by
getting
rid
of
them
said
madame
church
as
she
would
have
asked
celestine
to
remove
a
dish
of
cabbage
she
speaks
as
if
the
world
were
made
for
madame
church
i
intimated
to
her
that
if
she
objected
to
the
company
there
was
a
very
simple
remedy
and
at
present
elle
fait
ses
paquets
she
really
asked
you
to
get
the
rucks
out
of
the
house
she
asked
me
to
tell
them
that
their
rooms
had
been
let
three
months
ago
to
another
family
she
has
an
aplomb
church
aplomb
caused
me
considerable
diversion
i
am
not
sure
that
it
was
not
in
some
degree
to
laugh
over
it
at
my
leisure
that
i
went
out
into
the
garden
that
evening
to
smoke
a
cigar
the
night
was
dark
and
not
particularly
balmy
and
most
of
my
pensioners
after
dinner
had
remained
a
long
straight
walk
conducted
from
the
door
of
the
house
to
the
ancient
grille
that
i
have
described
and
i
stood
here
for
some
time
looking
through
the
iron
bars
at
the
silent
empty
street
the
prospect
was
not
entertaining
and
i
presently
turned
away
at
this
moment
i
saw
in
the
distance
the
door
of
the
house
open
and
throw
a
shaft
of
lamplight
into
the
darkness
into
the
lamplight
there
stepped
the
figure
of
a
female
who
presently
closed
the
door
behind
her
she
disappeared
in
the
dusk
of
the
garden
and
i
had
seen
her
but
for
an
instant
but
i
remained
under
the
impression
that
aurora
church
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
had
come
out
for
a
meditative
stroll
i
lingered
near
the
gate
keeping
the
red
tip
of
my
cigar
turned
toward
the
house
and
before
long
a
young
lady
emerged
from
among
the
shadows
of
the
trees
and
encountered
the
light
of
a
lamp
that
stood
just
outside
the
gate
it
was
in
fact
aurora
church
but
she
seemed
more
bent
upon
conversation
than
upon
meditation
she
stood
a
moment
looking
at
me
and
then
she
said
ought
i
to
retire
to
return
to
the
house
if
you
ought
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
tell
you
so
i
answered
but
we
are
all
alone
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
garden
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
alone
with
a
young
lady
i
am
not
at
all
terrified
ah
but
i
said
the
young
girl
i
have
never
been
alone
then
quickly
she
interrupted
herself
good
there
another
false
note
yes
i
am
obliged
to
admit
that
one
is
very
false
she
stood
looking
at
me
i
am
going
away
after
that
there
will
be
no
one
to
tell
me
chapter
x
that
will
matter
little
i
presently
replied
telling
you
will
do
no
good
ah
why
do
you
say
that
murmured
aurora
church
i
said
it
partly
because
it
was
true
but
i
said
it
for
other
reasons
as
well
which
it
was
hard
to
define
standing
there
in
the
night
air
in
the
vague
light
this
young
lady
looked
extremely
interesting
and
the
interest
of
her
appearance
was
not
diminished
by
a
suspicion
on
my
own
part
that
she
had
come
into
the
garden
knowing
me
to
be
there
i
thought
her
a
charming
girl
and
i
felt
very
sorry
for
her
but
as
i
looked
at
her
the
terms
in
which
madame
beaurepas
had
ventured
to
characterise
her
recurred
to
me
with
a
certain
force
i
had
professed
a
contempt
for
them
at
the
time
but
it
now
came
into
my
head
that
perhaps
this
unfortunately
situated
this
insidiously
mutinous
young
creature
was
looking
out
for
a
preserver
she
was
certainly
not
a
girl
to
throw
herself
at
a
man
head
but
it
was
possible
that
in
her
intense
her
almost
to
put
into
effect
an
ideal
which
was
perhaps
after
all
charged
with
as
many
fallacies
as
her
mother
affirmed
she
might
do
something
reckless
and
irregular
something
in
which
a
sympathetic
compatriot
as
yet
unknown
would
find
his
profit
the
image
unshaped
though
it
was
of
this
sympathetic
compatriot
filled
me
with
a
sort
of
envy
for
some
moments
i
was
silent
conscious
of
these
things
and
then
i
answered
her
question
because
some
things
some
differences
are
felt
not
learned
to
you
liberty
is
not
natural
you
are
like
a
person
who
has
bought
a
repeater
and
in
his
satisfaction
is
constantly
making
it
sound
to
a
real
american
girl
her
liberty
is
a
very
old
clock
ah
you
mean
then
said
the
poor
girl
that
my
mother
has
ruined
me
ruined
you
she
has
so
perverted
my
mind
that
when
i
try
to
be
natural
i
am
necessarily
immodest
that
again
is
a
false
note
i
said
laughing
she
turned
away
i
think
you
are
cruel
by
no
means
i
declared
because
for
my
own
taste
i
prefer
you
as
as
i
hesitated
and
she
turned
back
as
what
as
you
are
she
looked
at
me
a
while
again
and
then
she
said
in
a
little
reasoning
voice
that
reminded
me
of
her
mother
only
that
it
was
conscious
and
studied
i
was
not
aware
that
i
am
under
any
particular
obligation
to
please
you
and
then
she
gave
a
clear
laugh
quite
at
variance
with
her
voice
oh
there
is
no
obligation
i
said
but
one
has
preferences
i
am
very
sorry
you
are
going
away
what
does
it
matter
to
you
you
are
going
yourself
as
i
am
going
in
a
different
direction
that
makes
all
the
greater
separation
she
answered
nothing
she
stood
looking
through
the
bars
of
the
tall
gate
at
the
empty
dusky
street
this
grille
is
like
a
cage
she
said
at
last
fortunately
it
is
a
cage
that
will
open
and
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
lock
do
open
it
and
she
pressed
the
gate
back
if
you
should
open
it
i
would
go
out
and
never
return
where
should
you
go
to
america
straight
away
somehow
or
other
i
would
go
to
the
american
consul
i
would
beg
him
to
give
me
money
to
help
me
i
received
this
assertion
without
a
smile
i
was
not
in
a
smiling
humour
on
the
contrary
i
felt
singularly
excited
and
i
kept
my
hand
on
the
lock
of
the
gate
i
believed
or
i
thought
i
believed
what
my
companion
said
and
i
had
absurd
as
it
may
appear
an
irritated
vision
of
her
throwing
herself
upon
consular
sympathy
it
seemed
to
me
for
a
moment
that
to
pass
out
of
that
gate
with
this
yearning
straining
young
creature
would
be
to
pass
into
some
mysterious
felicity
if
i
were
only
a
hero
of
romance
i
would
offer
myself
to
take
her
to
america
in
a
moment
more
perhaps
i
should
have
persuaded
myself
that
i
was
one
but
at
this
juncture
i
heard
a
sound
that
was
not
romantic
it
proved
to
be
the
very
realistic
tread
of
celestine
the
cook
who
stood
grinning
at
us
as
we
turned
about
from
our
colloquy
i
ask
bien
pardon
said
celestine
the
mother
of
mademoiselle
desires
that
mademoiselle
should
come
in
immediately
le
pasteur
galopin
has
come
to
make
his
adieux
to
ces
dames
aurora
gave
me
only
one
glance
but
it
was
a
touching
one
then
she
slowly
departed
with
celestine
the
next
morning
on
coming
into
the
garden
i
found
that
church
and
her
daughter
had
departed
i
was
informed
of
this
fact
by
old
pigeonneau
who
sat
there
under
a
tree
having
his
coffee
at
a
little
green
table
i
have
nothing
to
envy
you
he
said
i
had
the
last
glimpse
of
that
charming
miss
aurora
i
had
a
very
late
glimpse
i
answered
and
it
was
all
i
could
possibly
desire
i
have
always
noticed
rejoined
pigeonneau
that
your
desires
are
more
moderate
than
mine
que
i
am
of
the
old
school
je
crois
que
la
race
se
perd
i
regret
the
departure
of
that
young
girl
she
had
an
enchanting
smile
ce
sera
une
femme
for
the
mother
i
can
console
myself
i
am
not
sure
that
she
was
a
femme
though
she
wished
to
pass
for
one
round
rosy
potelee
she
yet
had
not
the
temperament
of
her
appearance
she
was
a
femme
austere
i
have
often
noticed
that
contradiction
in
american
ladies
you
see
a
plump
little
woman
with
a
speaking
eye
and
the
contour
and
complexion
of
a
ripe
peach
and
if
you
venture
to
conduct
yourself
in
the
smallest
degree
in
accordance
with
these
indices
you
discover
a
species
of
methodist
of
what
do
you
call
it
of
quakeress
on
the
other
hand
you
encounter
a
tall
lean
angular
person
without
colour
without
grace
all
elbows
and
knees
and
you
find
it
a
nature
of
the
tropics
the
women
of
duty
look
like
coquettes
and
the
others
look
like
alpenstocks
however
we
have
still
the
handsome
madame
ruck
a
real
femme
de
rubens
la
it
is
very
true
that
to
talk
to
her
one
must
know
the
flemish
tongue
i
had
determined
in
accordance
with
my
brother
telegram
to
go
away
in
the
afternoon
so
that
having
various
duties
to
perform
i
left
pigeonneau
to
his
international
comparisons
among
other
things
i
went
in
the
course
of
the
morning
to
the
banker
to
draw
money
for
my
journey
and
there
i
found
ruck
with
a
pile
of
crumpled
letters
in
his
lap
his
chair
tipped
back
and
his
eyes
gloomily
fixed
on
the
fringe
of
the
green
plush
i
timidly
expressed
the
hope
that
he
had
got
better
news
from
home
whereupon
he
gave
me
a
look
in
which
considering
his
provocation
the
absence
of
irritation
was
conspicuous
he
took
up
his
letters
in
his
large
hand
and
crushing
them
together
held
it
out
to
me
that
epistolary
matter
he
said
is
worth
about
five
cents
but
i
guess
he
added
rising
i
have
taken
it
in
by
this
time
when
i
had
drawn
my
money
i
asked
him
to
come
and
breakfast
with
me
at
the
little
brasserie
much
favoured
by
students
to
which
i
used
to
resort
in
the
old
town
i
could
eat
sir
he
said
i
could
eat
bad
news
takes
away
the
appetite
but
i
guess
i
go
with
you
so
that
i
need
go
to
table
down
there
at
the
pension
the
old
woman
down
there
is
always
accusing
me
of
turning
up
my
nose
at
her
food
well
i
guess
i
sha
turn
up
my
nose
at
anything
now
we
went
to
the
little
brasserie
where
poor
ruck
made
the
lightest
possible
breakfast
but
if
he
ate
very
little
he
talked
a
great
deal
he
talked
about
business
going
into
a
hundred
details
in
which
i
was
quite
unable
to
follow
him
his
talk
was
not
angry
nor
bitter
it
was
a
long
meditative
melancholy
monologue
if
it
had
been
a
trifle
less
incoherent
i
should
almost
have
called
it
philosophic
i
was
very
sorry
for
him
i
wanted
to
do
something
for
him
but
the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
when
we
had
breakfasted
to
see
him
safely
back
to
the
pension
beaurepas
we
went
across
the
treille
and
down
the
corraterie
out
of
which
we
turned
into
the
rue
du
rhone
in
this
latter
street
as
all
the
world
knows
are
many
of
those
brilliant
jewellers
shops
for
which
geneva
is
famous
i
always
admired
their
glittering
windows
and
never
passed
them
without
a
lingering
glance
even
on
this
occasion
as
i
was
with
my
impending
departure
and
with
my
companion
troubles
i
suffered
my
eyes
to
wander
along
the
precious
tiers
that
flashed
and
twinkled
behind
the
huge
clear
plates
of
glass
thanks
to
this
inveterate
habit
i
made
a
discovery
in
the
largest
and
most
brilliant
of
these
establishments
i
perceived
two
ladies
seated
before
the
counter
with
an
air
of
absorption
which
sufficiently
proclaimed
their
identity
i
hoped
my
companion
would
not
see
them
but
as
we
came
abreast
of
the
door
a
little
beyond
we
found
it
open
to
the
warm
summer
air
ruck
happened
to
glance
in
and
he
immediately
recognised
his
wife
and
daughter
he
slowly
stopped
looking
at
them
i
wondered
what
he
would
do
the
salesman
was
holding
up
a
bracelet
before
them
on
its
velvet
cushion
and
flashing
it
about
in
an
irresistible
manner
ruck
said
nothing
but
he
presently
went
in
and
i
did
the
same
it
will
be
an
opportunity
i
remarked
as
cheerfully
as
possible
for
me
to
bid
to
the
ladies
they
turned
round
when
ruck
came
in
and
looked
at
him
without
confusion
well
you
had
better
go
home
to
breakfast
remarked
his
wife
miss
sophy
made
no
remark
but
she
took
