its
story
and

lessons
by

beesley
b
a
scholar
of
gonville
and
caius
college
one
of
the
survivors
preface
the
circumstances
in
which
this
book
came
to
be
written
are
as
follows
some
five
weeks
after
the
survivors
from
the
titanic
landed
in
new
york
i
was
the
guest
at
luncheon
of
hon
samuel
j
elder
and
hon
charles
gallagher
both
lawyers
in
boston
after
luncheon
i
was
asked
to
relate
to
those
present
the
experiences
of
the
survivors
in
leaving
the
titanic
and
reaching
the
carpathia
when
i
had
done
so
robert
lincoln
the
editor
of
the
urged
me
as
a
matter
of
public
interest
to
write
a
correct
history
of
the
titanic
disaster
his
reason
being
that
he
knew
several
publications
were
in
preparation
by
people
who
had
not
been
present
at
the
disaster
but
from
newspaper
accounts
were
piecing
together
a
description
of
it
he
said
that
these
publications
would
probably
be
erroneous
full
of
highly
coloured
details
and
generally
calculated
to
disturb
public
thought
on
the
matter
he
was
supported
in
his
request
by
all
present
and
under
this
general
pressure
i
accompanied
him
to
houghton
mifflin
company
where
we
discussed
the
question
of
publication
houghton
mifflin
company
took
at
that
time
exactly
the
same
view
that
i
did
that
it
was
probably
not
advisable
to
put
on
record
the
incidents
connected
with
the
titanic
sinking
it
seemed
better
to
forget
details
as
rapidly
as
possible
however
we
decided
to
take
a
few
days
to
think
about
it
at
our
next
meeting
we
found
ourselves
in
agreement
again
but
this
time
on
the
common
ground
that
it
would
probably
be
a
wise
thing
to
write
a
history
of
the
titanic
disaster
as
correctly
as
possible
i
was
supported
in
this
decision
by
the
fact
that
a
short
account
which
i
wrote
at
intervals
on
board
the
carpathia
in
the
hope
that
it
would
calm
public
opinion
by
stating
the
truth
of
what
happened
as
nearly
as
i
could
recollect
it
appeared
in
all
the
american
english
and
colonial
papers
and
had
exactly
the
effect
it
was
intended
to
have
this
encourages
me
to
hope
that
the
effect
of
this
work
will
be
the
same
another
matter
aided
me
in
coming
to
a
decision
the
duty
that
we
as
survivors
of
the
disaster
owe
to
those
who
went
down
with
the
ship
to
see
that
the
reforms
so
urgently
needed
are
not
allowed
to
be
forgotten
whoever
reads
the
account
of
the
cries
that
came
to
us
afloat
on
the
sea
from
those
sinking
in
the
water
must
remember
that
they
were
addressed
to
him
just
as
much
as
to
those
who
heard
them
and
that
the
duty
of
seeing
that
reforms
are
carried
out
devolves
on
every
one
who
knows
that
such
cries
were
heard
in
utter
helplessness

the
history
of
the
titanic
of
the
white
star
line
is
one
of
the
most
tragically
short
it
is
possible
to
conceive
the
world
had
waited
expectantly
for
its
launching
and
again
for
its
sailing
had
read
accounts
of
its
tremendous
size
and
its
unexampled
completeness
and
luxury
had
felt
it
a
matter
of
the
greatest
satisfaction
that
such
a
comfortable
and
above
all
such
a
safe
boat
had
been
designed
and
built
the
unsinkable
lifeboat
and
then
in
a
moment
to
hear
that
it
had
gone
to
the
bottom
as
if
it
had
been
the
veriest
tramp
steamer
of
a
few
hundred
tons
and
with
it
fifteen
hundred
passengers
some
of
them
known
the
world
over
the
improbability
of
such
a
thing
ever
happening
was
what
staggered
humanity
if
its
history
had
to
be
written
in
a
single
paragraph
it
would
be
somewhat
as
follows
the
titanic
was
built
by
harland
wolff
at
their
works
at
queen
island
belfast
side
by
side
with
her
sister
ship
the
olympic
the
twin
vessels
marked
such
an
increase
in
size
that
specially
joiner
and
boiler
shops
were
prepared
to
aid
in
their
construction
and
the
space
usually
taken
up
by
three
building
slips
was
given
up
to
them
the
keel
of
the
titanic
was
laid
on
march
and
she
was
launched
on
may
she
passed
her
trials
before
the
board
of
trade
officials
on
march
at
belfast
arrived
at
southampton
on
april
and
sailed
the
following
wednesday
april
with
passengers
and
crew
on
her
maiden
voyage
to
new
york
she
called
at
cherbourg
the
same
day
queenstown
thursday
and
left
for
new
york
in
the
afternoon
expecting
to
arrive
the
following
wednesday
morning
but
the
voyage
was
never
completed
she
collided
with
an
iceberg
on
sunday
at
in
lat
and
long
and
sank
two
hours
and
a
half
later
of
her
passengers
and
of
her
crew
were
drowned
and
rescued
by
the
carpathia
such
is
the
record
of
the
titanic
the
largest
ship
the
world
had
ever
seen
she
was
three
inches
longer
than
the
olympic
and
one
thousand
tons
more
in
gross
tonnage
and
her
end
was
the
greatest
maritime
disaster
known
the
whole
civilized
world
was
stirred
to
its
depths
when
the
full
extent
of
loss
of
life
was
learned
and
it
has
not
yet
recovered
from
the
shock
and
that
is
without
doubt
a
good
thing
it
should
not
recover
from
it
until
the
possibility
of
such
a
disaster
occurring
again
has
been
utterly
removed
from
human
society
whether
by
separate
legislation
in
different
countries
or
by
international
agreement
no
living
person
should
seek
to
dwell
in
thought
for
one
moment
on
such
a
disaster
except
in
the
endeavour
to
glean
from
it
knowledge
that
will
be
of
profit
to
the
whole
world
in
the
future
when
such
knowledge
is
practically
applied
in
the
construction
equipment
and
navigation
of
passenger
steamers
and
not
until
then
will
be
the
time
to
cease
to
think
of
the
titanic
disaster
and
of
the
hundreds
of
men
and
women
so
needlessly
sacrificed
a
few
words
on
the
ship
construction
and
equipment
will
be
necessary
in
order
to
make
clear
many
points
that
arise
in
the
course
of
this
book
a
few
figures
have
been
added
which
it
is
hoped
will
help
the
reader
to
follow
events
more
closely
than
he
otherwise
could
the
considerations
that
inspired
the
builders
to
design
the
titanic
on
the
lines
on
which
she
was
constructed
were
those
of
speed
weight
of
displacement
passenger
and
cargo
accommodation
high
speed
is
very
expensive
because
the
initial
cost
of
the
necessary
powerful
machinery
is
enormous
the
running
expenses
entailed
very
heavy
and
passenger
and
cargo
accommodation
have
to
be
fined
down
to
make
the
resistance
through
the
water
as
little
as
possible
and
to
keep
the
weight
down
an
increase
in
size
brings
a
builder
at
once
into
conflict
with
the
question
of
dock
and
harbour
accommodation
at
the
ports
she
will
touch
if
her
total
displacement
is
very
great
while
the
lines
are
kept
slender
for
speed
the
draught
limit
may
be
exceeded
the
titanic
therefore
was
built
on
broader
lines
than
the
ocean
racers
increasing
the
total
displacement
but
because
of
the
broader
build
she
was
able
to
keep
within
the
draught
limit
at
each
port
she
visited
at
the
same
time
she
was
able
to
accommodate
more
passengers
and
cargo
and
thereby
increase
largely
her
earning
capacity
a
comparison
between
the
mauretania
and
the
titanic
illustrates
the
difference
in
these
respects
displacement

power
speed

mauretania
titanic
the
vessel
when
completed
was
feet
long
feet
broad
her
height
from
keel
to
bridge
was
feet
she
had
steel
decks
a
cellular
double
bottom
feet
through
the
inner
and
outer
skins
and
with
bilge
keels
projecting
feet
for
feet
of
her
length
amidships
these
latter
were
intended
to
lessen
the
tendency
to
roll
in
a
sea
they
no
doubt
did
so
very
well
but
as
it
happened
they
proved
to
be
a
weakness
for
this
was
the
first
portion
of
the
ship
touched
by
the
iceberg
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
keels
were
forced
inwards
by
the
collision
and
made
the
work
of
smashing
in
the
two
skins
a
more
simple
matter
not
that
the
final
result
would
have
been
any
different
her
machinery
was
an
expression
of
the
latest
progress
in
marine
engineering
being
a
combination
of
reciprocating
engines
with
parsons
turbine
engine
a
combination
which
gives
increased
power
with
the
same
steam
consumption
an
advance
on
the
use
of
reciprocating
engines
alone
the
reciprocating
engines
drove
the
and
the
turbine
a
making
her
a
vessel
to
drive
these
engines
she
had
enormous
boilers
and
furnaces
three
elliptical
funnels
feet
inches
in
the
widest
diameter
took
away
smoke
and
water
gases
the
fourth
one
was
a
dummy
for
ventilation
she
was
fitted
with
lifeboats
feet
long
swung
on
davits
of
the
welin
type
these
davits
are
specially
designed
for
dealing
with
two
and
where
necessary
three
sets
of
lifeboats
altogether
more
than
enough
to
have
saved
every
soul
on
board
on
the
night
of
the
collision
she
was
divided
into
compartments
by
transverse
watertight
bulkheads
reaching
from
the
double
bottom
to
the
upper
deck
in
the
forward
end
and
to
the
saloon
deck
in
the
after
end
fig
in
both
cases
well
above
the
water
line
communication
between
the
engine
rooms
and
boiler
rooms
was
through
watertight
doors
which
could
all
be
closed
instantly
from
the
captain
bridge
a
single
switch
controlling
powerful
operated
them
they
could
also
be
closed
by
hand
with
a
lever
and
in
case
the
floor
below
them
was
flooded
by
accident
a
float
underneath
the
flooring
shut
them
automatically
these
compartments
were
so
designed
that
if
the
two
largest
were
flooded
with
water
a
most
unlikely
contingency
in
the
ordinary
way
the
ship
would
still
be
quite
safe
of
course
more
than
two
were
flooded
the
night
of
the
collision
but
exactly
how
many
is
not
yet
thoroughly
established
her
crew
had
a
complement
of
made
up
of
stewards
cooks
engineers
and
engaged
in
her
navigation
the
machinery
and
equipment
of
the
titanic
was
the
finest
obtainable
and
represented
the
last
word
in
marine
construction
all
her
structure
was
of
steel
of
a
weight
size
and
thickness
greater
than
that
of
any
ship
yet
known
the
girders
beams
bulkheads
and
floors
all
of
exceptional
strength
it
would
hardly
seem
necessary
to
mention
this
were
it
not
that
there
is
an
impression
among
a
portion
of
the
general
public
that
the
provision
of
turkish
baths
gymnasiums
and
other
luxuries
involved
a
sacrifice
of
some
more
essential
things
the
absence
of
which
was
responsible
for
the
loss
of
so
many
lives
but
this
is
quite
an
erroneous
impression
all
these
things
were
an
additional
provision
for
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
passengers
and
there
is
no
more
reason
why
they
should
not
be
provided
on
these
ships
than
in
a
large
hotel
there
were
places
on
the
titanic
deck
where
more
boats
and
rafts
could
have
been
stored
without
sacrificing
these
things
the
fault
lay
in
not
providing
them
not
in
designing
the
ship
without
places
to
put
them
on
whom
the
responsibility
must
rest
for
their
not
being
provided
is
another
matter
and
must
be
left
until
later
when
arranging
a
tour
round
the
united
states
i
had
decided
to
cross
in
the
titanic
for
several
reasons
one
that
it
was
rather
a
novelty
to
be
on
board
the
largest
ship
yet
launched
and
another
that
friends
who
had
crossed
in
the
olympic
described
her
as
a
most
comfortable
boat
in
a
seaway
and
it
was
reported
that
the
titanic
had
been
still
further
improved
in
this
respect
by
having
a
thousand
tons
more
built
in
to
steady
her
i
went
on
board
at
southampton
at
wednesday
april
after
staying
the
night
in
the
town
it
is
pathetic
to
recall
that
as
i
sat
that
morning
in
the
breakfast
room
of
an
hotel
from
the
windows
of
which
could
be
seen
the
four
huge
funnels
of
the
titanic
towering
over
the
roofs
of
the
various
shipping
offices
opposite
and
the
procession
of
stokers
and
stewards
wending
their
way
to
the
ship
there
sat
behind
me
three
of
the
titanic
passengers
discussing
the
coming
voyage
and
estimating
among
other
things
the
probabilities
of
an
accident
at
sea
to
the
ship
as
i
rose
from
breakfast
i
glanced
at
the
group
and
recognized
them
later
on
board
but
they
were
not
among
the
number
who
answered
to
the
on
the
carpathia
on
the
following
monday
morning
between
the
time
of
going
on
board
and
sailing
i
inspected
in
the
company
of
two
friends
who
had
come
from
exeter
to
see
me
off
the
various
decks
and
libraries
and
so
extensive
were
they
that
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
it
was
quite
easy
to
lose
one
way
on
such
a
ship
we
wandered
casually
into
the
gymnasium
on
the
boatdeck
and
were
engaged
in
bicycle
exercise
when
the
instructor
came
in
with
two
photographers
and
insisted
on
our
remaining
there
while
his
friends
as
we
thought
at
the
time
made
a
record
for
him
of
his
apparatus
in
use
it
was
only
later
that
we
discovered
that
they
were
the
photographers
of
one
of
the
illustrated
london
papers
more
passengers
came
in
and
the
instructor
ran
here
and
there
looking
the
very
picture
of
robust
health
and
fitness
in
his
white
flannels
placing
one
passenger
on
the
electric
horse
another
on
the
camel
while
the
laughing
group
of
onlookers
watched
the
inexperienced
riders
vigorously
shaken
up
and
down
as
he
controlled
the
little
motor
which
made
the
machines
imitate
so
realistically
horse
and
camel
exercise
it
is
related
that
on
the
night
of
the
disaster
right
up
to
the
time
of
the
titanic
sinking
while
the
band
grouped
outside
the
gymnasium
doors
played
with
such
supreme
courage
in
face
of
the
water
which
rose
foot
by
foot
before
their
eyes
the
instructor
was
on
duty
inside
with
passengers
on
the
bicycles
and
the
still
assisting
and
encouraging
to
the
last
along
with
the
bandsmen
it
is
fitting
that
his
name
which
i
do
not
think
has
yet
been
put
on
record
it
is
mccawley
should
have
a
place
in
the
honourable
list
of
those
who
did
their
duty
faithfully
to
the
ship
and
the
line
they
served
chapter
ii
from
southampton
to
the
night
of
the
collision
soon
after
noon
the
whistles
blew
for
friends
to
go
ashore
the
gangways
were
withdrawn
and
the
titanic
moved
slowly
down
the
dock
to
the
accompaniment
of
last
messages
and
shouted
farewells
of
those
on
the
quay
there
was
no
cheering
or
hooting
of
steamers
whistles
from
the
fleet
of
ships
that
lined
the
dock
as
might
seem
probable
on
the
occasion
of
the
largest
vessel
in
the
world
putting
to
sea
on
her
maiden
voyage
the
whole
scene
was
quiet
and
rather
ordinary
with
little
of
the
picturesque
and
interesting
ceremonial
which
imagination
paints
as
usual
in
such
circumstances
but
if
this
was
lacking
two
unexpected
dramatic
incidents
supplied
a
thrill
of
excitement
and
interest
to
the
departure
from
dock
the
first
of
these
occurred
just
before
the
last
gangway
was
withdrawn
a
knot
of
stokers
ran
along
the
quay
with
their
kit
slung
over
their
shoulders
in
bundles
and
made
for
the
gangway
with
the
evident
intention
of
joining
the
ship
but
a
petty
officer
guarding
the
shore
end
of
the
gangway
firmly
refused
to
allow
them
on
board
they
argued
gesticulated
apparently
attempting
to
explain
the
reasons
why
they
were
late
but
he
remained
obdurate
and
waved
them
back
with
a
determined
hand
the
gangway
was
dragged
back
amid
their
protests
putting
a
summary
ending
to
their
determined
efforts
to
join
the
titanic
those
stokers
must
be
thankful
men
that
some
circumstance
whether
their
own
lack
of
punctuality
or
some
unforeseen
delay
over
which
they
had
no
control
prevented
their
being
in
time
to
run
up
that
last
gangway
they
will
have
told
and
will
no
doubt
tell
for
years
the
story
of
how
their
lives
were
probably
saved
by
being
too
late
to
join
the
titanic
the
second
incident
occurred
soon
afterwards
and
while
it
has
no
doubt
been
thoroughly
described
at
the
time
by
those
on
shore
perhaps
a
view
of
the
occurrence
from
the
deck
of
the
titanic
will
not
be
without
interest
as
the
titanic
moved
majestically
down
the
dock
the
crowd
of
friends
keeping
pace
with
us
along
the
quay
we
came
together
level
with
the
steamer
new
york
lying
moored
to
the
side
of
the
dock
along
with
the
oceanic
the
crowd
waving
to
those
on
board
as
well
as
they
could
for
the
intervening
bulk
of
the
two
ships
but
as
the
bows
of
our
ship
came
about
level
with
those
of
the
new
york
there
came
a
series
of
reports
like
those
of
a
revolver
and
on
the
quay
side
of
the
new
york
snaky
coils
of
thick
rope
flung
themselves
high
in
the
air
and
fell
backwards
among
the
crowd
which
retreated
in
alarm
to
escape
the
flying
ropes
we
hoped
that
no
one
was
struck
by
the
ropes
but
a
sailor
next
to
me
was
certain
he
saw
a
woman
carried
away
to
receive
attention
and
then
to
our
amazement
the
new
york
crept
towards
us
slowly
and
stealthily
as
if
drawn
by
some
invisible
force
which
she
was
powerless
to
withstand
it
reminded
me
instantly
of
an
experiment
i
had
shown
many
times
to
a
form
of
boys
learning
the
elements
of
physics
in
a
laboratory
in
which
a
small
magnet
is
made
to
float
on
a
cork
in
a
bowl
of
water
and
small
steel
objects
placed
on
neighbouring
pieces
of
cork
are
drawn
up
to
the
floating
magnet
by
magnetic
force
it
reminded
me
too
of
seeing
in
my
little
boy
bath
how
a
large
celluloid
floating
duck
would
draw
towards
itself
by
what
is
called
capillary
attraction
smaller
ducks
frogs
beetles
and
other
animal
folk
until
the
menagerie
floated
about
as
a
unit
oblivious
of
their
natural
antipathies
and
reminding
us
of
the
happy
families
one
sees
in
cages
on
the
seashore
on
the
new
york
there
was
shouting
of
orders
sailors
running
to
and
fro
paying
out
ropes
and
putting
mats
over
the
side
where
it
seemed
likely
we
should
collide
the
tug
which
had
a
few
moments
before
cast
off
from
the
bows
of
the
titanic
came
up
around
our
stern
and
passed
to
the
quay
side
of
the
new
york
stern
made
fast
to
her
and
started
to
haul
her
back
with
all
the
force
her
engines
were
capable
of
but
it
did
not
seem
that
the
tug
made
much
impression
on
the
new
york
apart
from
the
serious
nature
of
the
accident
it
made
an
irresistibly
comic
picture
to
see
the
huge
vessel
drifting
down
the
dock
with
a
snorting
tug
at
its
heels
for
all
the
world
like
a
small
boy
dragging
a
diminutive
puppy
down
the
road
with
its
teeth
locked
on
a
piece
of
rope
its
feet
splayed
out
its
head
and
body
shaking
from
side
to
side
in
the
effort
to
get
every
ounce
of
its
weight
used
to
the
best
advantage
at
first
all
appearance
showed
that
the
sterns
of
the
two
vessels
would
collide
but
from
the
stern
bridge
of
the
titanic
an
officer
directing
operations
stopped
us
dead
the
suction
ceased
and
the
new
york
with
her
tug
trailing
behind
moved
obliquely
down
the
dock
her
stern
gliding
along
the
side
of
the
titanic
some
few
yards
away
it
gave
an
extraordinary
impression
of
the
absolute
helplessness
of
a
big
liner
in
the
absence
of
any
motive
power
to
guide
her
but
all
excitement
was
not
yet
over
the
new
york
turned
her
bows
inward
towards
the
quay
her
stern
swinging
just
clear
of
and
passing
in
front
of
our
bows
and
moved
slowly
head
on
for
the
teutonic
lying
moored
to
the
side
mats
were
quickly
got
out
and
so
deadened
the
force
of
the
collision
which
from
where
we
were
seemed
to
be
too
slight
to
cause
any
damage
another
tug
came
up
and
took
hold
of
the
new
york
by
the
bows
and
between
the
two
of
them
they
dragged
her
round
the
corner
of
the
quay
which
just
here
came
to
an
end
on
the
side
of
the
river
we
now
moved
slowly
ahead
and
passed
the
teutonic
at
a
creeping
pace
but
notwithstanding
this
the
latter
strained
at
her
ropes
so
much
that
she
heeled
over
several
degrees
in
her
efforts
to
follow
the
titanic
the
crowd
were
shouted
back
a
group
of
officials
probably
the
and
his
staff
standing
on
the
sea
side
of
the
moored
ropes
jumped
back
over
them
as
they
drew
up
taut
to
a
rigid
line
and
urged
the
crowd
back
still
farther
but
we
were
just
clear
and
as
we
slowly
turned
the
corner
into
the
river
i
saw
the
teutonic
swing
slowly
back
into
her
normal
station
relieving
the
tension
alike
of
the
ropes
and
of
the
minds
of
all
who
witnessed
the
incident
illustration
four
decks
of
olympic
sister
ship
of
titanic
unpleasant
as
this
incident
was
it
was
interesting
to
all
the
passengers
leaning
over
the
rails
to
see
the
means
adopted
by
the
officers
and
crew
of
the
various
vessels
to
avoid
collision
to
see
on
the
titanic
at
the
stern
an
officer
and
seamen
telephoning
and
ringing
bells
hauling
up
and
down
little
red
and
white
flags
as
danger
of
collision
alternately
threatened
and
diminished
no
one
was
more
interested
than
a
young
american
kinematograph
photographer
who
with
his
wife
followed
the
whole
scene
with
eager
eyes
turning
the
handle
of
his
camera
with
the
most
evident
pleasure
as
he
recorded
the
unexpected
incident
on
his
films
it
was
obviously
quite
a
windfall
for
him
to
have
been
on
board
at
such
a
time
but
neither
the
film
nor
those
who
exposed
it
reached
the
other
side
and
the
record
of
the
accident
from
the
titanic
deck
has
never
been
thrown
on
the
screen
as
we
steamed
down
the
river
the
scene
we
had
just
witnessed
was
the
topic
of
every
conversation
the
comparison
with
the
collision
was
drawn
in
every
little
group
of
passengers
and
it
seemed
to
be
generally
agreed
that
this
would
confirm
the
suction
theory
which
was
so
successfully
advanced
by
the
cruiser
hawke
in
the
law
courts
but
which
many
people
scoffed
at
when
the
british
admiralty
first
suggested
it
as
the
explanation
of
the
cruiser
ramming
the
olympic
and
since
this
is
an
attempt
to
chronicle
facts
as
they
happened
on
board
the
titanic
it
must
be
recorded
that
there
were
among
the
passengers
and
such
of
the
crew
as
were
heard
to
speak
on
the
matter
the
direst
misgivings
at
the
incident
we
had
just
witnessed
sailors
are
proverbially
superstitious
far
too
many
people
are
prone
to
follow
their
lead
or
indeed
the
lead
of
any
one
who
asserts
a
statement
with
an
air
of
conviction
and
the
opportunity
of
constant
repetition
the
sense
of
mystery
that
shrouds
a
prophetic
utterance
particularly
if
it
be
an
ominous
one
for
so
constituted
apparently
is
the
human
mind
that
it
will
receive
the
impress
of
an
evil
prophecy
far
more
readily
than
it
will
that
of
a
beneficent
one
possibly
through
subservient
fear
to
the
thing
it
dreads
possibly
through
the
degraded
morbid
attraction
which
the
sense
of
evil
has
for
the
innate
evil
in
the
human
mind
leads
many
people
to
pay
a
certain
respect
to
superstitious
theories
not
that
they
wholly
believe
in
them
or
would
wish
their
dearest
friends
to
know
they
ever
gave
them
a
second
thought
but
the
feeling
that
other
people
do
so
and
the
half
conviction
that
there
may
be
something
in
it
after
all
sways
them
into
tacit
obedience
to
the
most
absurd
and
childish
theories
i
wish
in
a
later
chapter
to
discuss
the
subject
of
superstition
in
its
reference
to
our
life
on
board
the
titanic
but
will
anticipate
events
here
a
little
by
relating
a
second
bad
omen
which
was
hatched
at
queenstown
as
one
of
the
tenders
containing
passengers
and
mails
neared
the
titanic
some
of
those
on
board
gazed
up
at
the
liner
towering
above
them
and
saw
a
head
black
from
his
work
in
the
stokehold
below
peering
out
at
them
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
enormous
funnels
a
dummy
one
for
ventilation
that
rose
many
feet
above
the
highest
deck
he
had
climbed
up
inside
for
a
joke
but
to
some
of
those
who
saw
him
there
the
sight
was
seed
for
the
growth
of
an
omen
which
bore
fruit
in
an
unknown
dread
of
dangers
to
come
an
american
lady
may
she
forgive
me
if
she
reads
these
lines
has
related
to
me
with
the
deepest
conviction
and
earnestness
of
manner
that
she
saw
the
man
and
attributes
the
sinking
of
the
titanic
largely
to
that
arrant
foolishness
you
may
say
yes
indeed
but
not
to
those
who
believe
in
it
and
it
is
well
not
to
have
such
prophetic
thoughts
of
danger
passed
round
among
passengers
and
crew
it
would
seem
to
have
an
unhealthy
influence
we
dropped
down
spithead
past
the
shores
of
the
isle
of
wight
looking
superbly
beautiful
in
new
spring
foliage
exchanged
salutes
with
a
white
star
tug
in
wait
for
one
of
their
liners
inward
bound
and
saw
in
the
distance
several
warships
with
attendant
black
destroyers
guarding
the
entrance
from
the
sea
in
the
calmest
weather
we
made
cherbourg
just
as
it
grew
dusk
and
left
again
about
after
taking
on
board
passengers
and
mails
we
reached
queenstown
about
noon
on
thursday
after
a
most
enjoyable
passage
across
the
channel
although
the
wind
was
almost
too
cold
to
allow
of
sitting
out
on
deck
on
thursday
morning
the
coast
of
ireland
looked
very
beautiful
as
we
approached
queenstown
harbour
the
brilliant
morning
sun
showing
up
the
green
hillsides
and
picking
out
groups
of
dwellings
dotted
here
and
there
above
the
rugged
grey
cliffs
that
fringed
the
coast
we
took
on
board
our
pilot
ran
slowly
towards
the
harbour
with
the
dropping
all
the
time
and
came
to
a
stop
well
out
to
sea
with
our
screws
churning
up
the
bottom
and
turning
the
sea
all
brown
with
sand
from
below
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
the
ship
stopped
rather
suddenly
and
in
my
ignorance
of
the
depth
of
the
harbour
entrance
that
perhaps
the
had
revealed
a
smaller
depth
than
was
thought
safe
for
the
great
size
of
the
titanic
this
seemed
to
be
confirmed
by
the
sight
of
sand
churned
up
from
the
bottom
but
this
is
mere
supposition
passengers
and
mails
were
put
on
board
from
two
tenders
and
nothing
could
have
given
us
a
better
idea
of
the
enormous
length
and
bulk
of
the
titanic
than
to
stand
as
far
astern
as
possible
and
look
over
the
side
from
the
top
deck
forwards
and
downwards
to
where
the
tenders
rolled
at
her
bows
the
merest
cockleshells
beside
the
majestic
vessel
that
rose
deck
after
deck
above
them
truly
she
was
a
magnificent
boat
there
was
something
so
graceful
in
her
movement
as
she
rode
up
and
down
on
the
slight
swell
in
the
harbour
a
slow
stately
dip
and
recover
only
noticeable
by
watching
her
bows
in
comparison
with
some
landmark
on
the
coast
in
the
near
distance
the
two
little
tenders
tossing
up
and
down
like
corks
beside
her
illustrated
vividly
the
advance
made
in
comfort
of
motion
from
the
time
of
the
small
steamer
presently
the
work
of
transfer
was
ended
the
tenders
cast
off
and
at
with
the
screws
churning
up
the
sea
bottom
again
the
titanic
turned
slowly
through
a
until
her
nose
pointed
down
along
the
irish
coast
and
then
steamed
rapidly
away
from
queenstown
the
little
house
on
the
left
of
the
town
gleaming
white
on
the
hillside
for
many
miles
astern
in
our
wake
soared
and
screamed
hundreds
of
gulls
which
had
quarrelled
and
fought
over
the
remnants
of
lunch
pouring
out
of
the
waste
pipes
as
we
in
the
harbour
entrance
and
now
they
followed
us
in
the
expectation
of
further
spoil
i
watched
them
for
a
long
time
and
was
astonished
at
the
ease
with
which
they
soared
and
kept
up
with
the
ship
with
hardly
a
motion
of
their
wings
picking
out
a
particular
gull
i
would
keep
him
under
observation
for
minutes
at
a
time
and
see
no
motion
of
his
wings
downwards
or
upwards
to
aid
his
flight
he
would
tilt
all
of
a
piece
to
one
side
or
another
as
the
gusts
of
wind
caught
him
rigidly
unbendable
as
an
aeroplane
tilts
sideways
in
a
puff
of
wind
and
yet
with
graceful
ease
he
kept
pace
with
the
titanic
forging
through
the
water
at
twenty
knots
as
the
wind
met
him
he
would
rise
upwards
and
obliquely
forwards
and
come
down
slantingly
again
his
wings
curved
in
a
beautiful
arch
and
his
tail
feathers
outspread
as
a
fan
it
was
plain
that
he
was
possessed
of
a
secret
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
learn
that
of
utilizing
as
escalators
up
and
down
which
he
can
glide
at
will
with
the
expenditure
of
the
minimum
amount
of
energy
or
of
using
them
as
a
ship
does
when
it
sails
within
one
or
two
points
of
a
head
wind
aviators
of
course
are
imitating
the
gull
and
soon
perhaps
we
may
see
an
aeroplane
or
a
glider
dipping
gracefully
up
and
down
in
the
face
of
an
opposing
wind
and
all
the
time
forging
ahead
across
the
atlantic
ocean
the
gulls
were
still
behind
us
when
night
fell
and
still
they
screamed
and
dipped
down
into
the
broad
wake
of
foam
which
we
left
behind
but
in
the
morning
they
were
gone
perhaps
they
had
seen
in
the
night
a
steamer
bound
for
their
queenstown
home
and
had
escorted
her
back
all
afternoon
we
steamed
along
the
coast
of
ireland
with
grey
cliffs
guarding
the
shores
and
hills
rising
behind
gaunt
and
barren
as
dusk
fell
the
coast
rounded
away
from
us
to
the
northwest
and
the
last
we
saw
of
europe
was
the
irish
mountains
dim
and
faint
in
the
dropping
darkness
with
the
thought
that
we
had
seen
the
last
of
land
until
we
set
foot
on
the
shores
of
america
i
retired
to
the
library
to
write
letters
little
knowing
that
many
things
would
happen
to
us
all
many
experiences
sudden
vivid
and
impressive
to
be
encountered
many
perils
to
be
faced
many
good
and
true
people
for
whom
we
should
have
to
mourn
before
we
saw
land
again
there
is
very
little
to
relate
from
the
time
of
leaving
queenstown
on
thursday
to
sunday
morning
the
sea
was
calm
so
calm
indeed
that
very
few
were
absent
from
meals
the
wind
westerly
and
southwesterly
fresh
as
the
daily
chart
described
it
but
often
rather
cold
generally
too
cold
to
sit
out
on
deck
to
read
or
write
so
that
many
of
us
spent
a
good
part
of
the
time
in
the
library
reading
and
writing
i
wrote
a
large
number
of
letters
and
posted
them
day
by
day
in
the
box
outside
the
library
door
possibly
they
are
there
yet
each
morning
the
sun
rose
behind
us
in
a
sky
of
circular
clouds
stretching
round
the
horizon
in
long
narrow
streaks
and
rising
tier
upon
tier
above
the
red
and
pink
and
fading
from
pink
to
white
as
the
sun
rose
higher
in
the
sky
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
to
one
who
had
not
crossed
the
ocean
before
or
indeed
been
out
of
sight
of
the
shores
of
england
to
stand
on
the
top
deck
and
watch
the
swell
of
the
sea
extending
outwards
from
the
ship
in
an
unbroken
circle
until
it
met
the
with
its
hint
of
infinity
behind
the
wake
of
the
vessel
white
with
foam
where
fancy
suggested
the
propeller
blades
had
cut
up
the
long
atlantic
rollers
and
with
them
made
a
level
white
road
bounded
on
either
side
by
banks
of
green
blue
and
waves
that
would
presently
sweep
away
the
white
road
though
as
yet
it
stretched
back
to
the
horizon
and
dipped
over
the
edge
of
the
world
back
to
ireland
and
the
gulls
while
along
it
the
morning
sun
glittered
and
sparkled
and
each
night
the
sun
sank
right
in
our
eyes
along
the
sea
making
an
undulating
glittering
path
way
a
golden
track
charted
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
which
our
ship
followed
unswervingly
until
the
sun
dipped
below
the
edge
of
the
horizon
and
the
pathway
ran
ahead
of
us
faster
than
we
could
steam
and
slipped
over
the
edge
of
the
skyline
as
if
the
sun
had
been
a
golden
ball
and
had
wound
up
its
thread
of
gold
too
quickly
for
us
to
follow
from
noon
thursday
to
noon
friday
we
ran
miles
friday
to
saturday
miles
saturday
to
sunday
miles
the
second
day
run
of
miles
was
the
purser
told
us
a
disappointment
and
we
should
not
dock
until
wednesday
morning
instead
of
tuesday
night
as
we
had
expected
however
on
sunday
we
were
glad
to
see
a
longer
run
had
been
made
and
it
was
thought
we
should
make
new
york
after
all
on
tuesday
night
the
purser
remarked
they
are
not
pushing
her
this
trip
and
do
intend
to
make
any
fast
running
i
do
suppose
we
shall
do
more
than
now
it
is
not
a
bad
day
run
for
the
first
trip
this
was
at
lunch
and
i
remember
the
conversation
then
turned
to
the
speed
and
build
of
atlantic
liners
as
factors
in
their
comfort
of
motion
all
those
who
had
crossed
many
times
were
unanimous
in
saying
the
titanic
was
the
most
comfortable
boat
they
had
been
on
and
they
preferred
the
speed
we
were
making
to
that
of
the
faster
boats
from
the
point
of
view
of
lessened
vibration
as
well
as
because
the
faster
boats
would
bore
through
the
waves
with
a
twisted
motion
instead
of
the
straight
swing
of
the
titanic
i
then
called
the
attention
of
our
table
to
the
way
the
titanic
listed
to
port
i
had
noticed
this
before
and
we
all
watched
the
through
the
portholes
as
we
sat
at
the
purser
table
in
the
saloon
it
was
plain
she
did
so
for
the
and
sea
on
the
port
side
were
visible
most
of
the
time
and
on
the
starboard
only
sky
the
purser
remarked
that
probably
coal
had
been
used
mostly
from
the
starboard
side
it
is
no
doubt
a
common
occurrence
for
all
vessels
to
list
to
some
degree
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
titanic
was
cut
open
on
the
starboard
side
and
before
she
sank
listed
so
much
to
port
that
there
was
quite
a
chasm
between
her
and
the
swinging
lifeboats
across
which
ladies
had
to
be
thrown
or
to
cross
on
chairs
laid
flat
the
previous
listing
to
port
may
be
of
interest
returning
for
a
moment
to
the
motion
of
the
titanic
it
was
interesting
to
stand
on
the
as
i
frequently
did
in
the
angle
between
lifeboats
and
on
the
starboard
side
two
boats
i
have
every
reason
to
remember
for
the
first
carried
me
in
safety
to
the
carpathia
and
it
seemed
likely
at
one
time
that
the
other
would
come
down
on
our
heads
as
we
sat
in
trying
to
get
away
from
the
ship
side
and
watch
the
general
motion
of
the
ship
through
the
waves
resolve
itself
into
two
motions
one
to
be
observed
by
contrasting
the
from
which
the
trailed
away
behind
in
the
foaming
wake
with
the
horizon
and
observing
the
long
slow
heave
as
we
rode
up
and
down
i
timed
the
average
period
occupied
in
one
vibration
but
do
not
now
remember
the
figures
the
second
motion
was
a
roll
and
could
be
calculated
by
watching
the
port
rail
and
contrasting
it
with
the
horizon
as
before
it
seems
likely
that
this
double
motion
is
due
to
the
angle
at
which
our
direction
to
new
york
cuts
the
general
set
of
the
gulf
stream
sweeping
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
across
to
europe
but
the
almost
regularity
of
the
two
vibratory
movements
was
what
attracted
my
attention
it
was
while
watching
the
side
roll
that
i
first
became
aware
of
the
list
to
port
looking
down
astern
from
the
or
from
b
deck
to
the
steerage
quarters
i
often
noticed
how
the
passengers
were
enjoying
every
minute
of
the
time
a
most
uproarious
skipping
game
of
the
type
was
the
great
favourite
while
in
and
out
and
roundabout
went
a
scotchman
with
his
bagpipes
playing
something
that
gilbert
says
faintly
resembled
an
air
standing
aloof
from
all
of
them
generally
on
the
raised
stern
deck
above
the
playing
field
was
a
man
of
about
twenty
to
years
of
age
always
gloved
and
nicely
groomed
and
obviously
quite
out
of
place
among
his
he
never
looked
happy
all
the
time
i
watched
him
and
classified
him
at
hazard
as
the
man
who
had
been
a
failure
in
some
way
at
home
and
had
received
the
proverbial
shilling
plus
fare
to
america
he
did
not
look
resolute
enough
or
happy
enough
to
be
working
out
his
own
problem
another
interesting
man
was
travelling
steerage
but
had
placed
his
wife
in
the
second
cabin
he
would
climb
the
stairs
leading
from
the
steerage
to
the
second
deck
and
talk
affectionately
with
his
wife
across
the
low
gate
which
separated
them
i
never
saw
him
after
the
collision
but
i
think
his
wife
was
on
the
carpathia
whether
they
ever
saw
each
other
on
the
sunday
night
is
very
doubtful
he
would
not
at
first
be
allowed
on
the
deck
and
if
he
were
the
chances
of
seeing
his
wife
in
the
darkness
and
the
crowd
would
be
very
small
indeed
of
all
those
playing
so
happily
on
the
steerage
deck
i
did
not
recognize
many
afterwards
on
the
carpathia
coming
now
to
sunday
the
day
on
which
the
titanic
struck
the
iceberg
it
will
be
interesting
perhaps
to
give
the
day
events
in
some
detail
to
appreciate
the
general
attitude
of
passengers
to
their
surroundings
just
before
the
collision
service
was
held
in
the
saloon
by
the
purser
in
the
morning
and
going
on
deck
after
lunch
we
found
such
a
change
in
temperature
that
not
many
cared
to
remain
to
face
the
bitter
wind
an
artificial
wind
created
mainly
if
not
entirely
by
the
ship
rapid
motion
through
the
chilly
atmosphere
i
should
judge
there
was
no
wind
blowing
at
the
time
for
i
had
noticed
about
the
same
force
of
wind
approaching
queenstown
to
find
that
it
died
away
as
soon
as
we
stopped
only
to
rise
again
as
we
steamed
away
from
the
harbour
returning
to
the
library
i
stopped
for
a
moment
to
read
again
the
day
run
and
observe
our
position
on
the
chart
the
rev
carter
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
was
similarly
engaged
and
we
renewed
a
conversation
we
had
enjoyed
for
some
days
it
had
commenced
with
a
discussion
of
the
relative
merits
of
his
university
oxford
with
mine
cambridge
as
educational
agencies
the
opportunities
at
each
for
the
formation
of
character
apart
from
mere
education
as
such
and
had
led
on
to
the
lack
of
sufficiently
qualified
men
to
take
up
the
work
of
the
church
of
england
a
matter
apparently
on
which
he
felt
very
deeply
and
from
that
to
his
own
work
in
england
as
a
priest
he
told
me
some
of
his
parish
problems
and
spoke
of
the
impossibility
of
doing
half
his
work
in
his
church
without
the
help
his
wife
gave
i
knew
her
only
slightly
at
that
time
but
meeting
her
later
in
the
day
i
realized
something
of
what
he
meant
in
attributing
a
large
part
of
what
success
he
had
as
a
vicar
to
her
my
only
excuse
for
mentioning
these
details
about
the
carters
now
and
later
in
the
day
is
that
while
they
have
perhaps
not
much
interest
for
the
average
reader
they
will
no
doubt
be
some
comfort
to
the
parish
over
which
he
presided
and
where
i
am
sure
he
was
loved
he
next
mentioned
the
absence
of
a
service
in
the
evening
and
asked
if
i
knew
the
purser
well
enough
to
request
the
use
of
the
saloon
in
the
evening
where
he
would
like
to
have
a
hymn
the
purser
gave
his
consent
at
once
and
carter
made
preparations
during
the
afternoon
by
asking
all
he
knew
and
many
he
did
not
to
come
to
the
saloon
at
the
library
was
crowded
that
afternoon
owing
to
the
cold
on
deck
but
through
the
windows
we
could
see
the
clear
sky
with
brilliant
sunlight
that
seemed
to
augur
a
fine
night
and
a
clear
day
and
the
prospect
of
landing
in
two
days
with
calm
weather
all
the
way
to
new
york
was
a
matter
of
general
satisfaction
among
us
all
i
can
look
back
and
see
every
detail
of
the
library
that
afternoon
the
beautifully
furnished
room
with
lounges
armchairs
and
small
writing
or
scattered
about
round
the
walls
of
the
room
and
the
library
in
shelves
flanking
one
side
the
whole
finished
in
mahogany
relieved
with
white
fluted
wooden
columns
that
supported
the
deck
above
through
the
windows
there
is
the
covered
corridor
reserved
by
general
consent
as
the
playground
and
here
are
playing
the
two
navatril
children
with
their
father
devoted
to
them
never
absent
from
them
who
would
have
thought
of
the
dramatic
history
of
the
happy
group
at
play
in
the
corridor
that
afternoon
the
abduction
of
the
children
in
nice
the
assumed
name
the
separation
of
father
and
children
in
a
few
hours
his
death
and
their
subsequent
union
with
their
mother
after
a
period
of
doubt
as
to
their
parentage
how
many
more
similar
secrets
the
titanic
revealed
in
the
privacy
of
family
life
or
carried
down
with
her
untold
we
shall
never
know
in
the
same
corridor
is
a
man
and
his
wife
with
two
children
and
one
of
them
he
is
generally
carrying
they
are
all
young
and
happy
he
is
dressed
always
in
a
grey
knickerbocker
suit
with
a
camera
slung
over
his
shoulder
i
have
not
seen
any
of
them
since
that
afternoon
close
beside
me
so
near
that
i
can
not
avoid
hearing
scraps
of
their
conversation
are
two
american
ladies
both
dressed
in
white
young
probably
friends
only
one
has
been
to
india
and
is
returning
by
way
of
england
the
other
is
a
in
america
a
graceful
girl
with
a
distinguished
air
heightened
by
a
pair
of
engaged
in
conversation
with
them
is
a
gentleman
whom
i
subsequently
identified
from
a
photograph
as
a
resident
of
cambridge
massachusetts
genial
polished
and
with
a
courtly
air
towards
the
two
ladies
whom
he
has
known
but
a
few
hours
from
time
to
time
as
they
talk
a
child
acquaintance
breaks
in
on
their
conversation
and
insists
on
their
taking
notice
of
a
large
doll
clasped
in
her
arms
i
have
seen
none
of
this
group
since
then
in
the
opposite
corner
are
the
young
american
kinematograph
photographer
and
his
young
wife
evidently
french
very
fond
of
playing
patience
which
she
is
doing
now
while
he
sits
back
in
his
chair
watching
the
game
and
interposing
from
time
to
time
with
suggestions
i
did
not
see
them
again
in
the
middle
of
the
room
are
two
catholic
priests
one
quietly
reading
either
english
or
irish
and
probably
the
latter
the
other
dark
bearded
with
hat
talking
earnestly
to
a
friend
in
german
and
evidently
explaining
some
verse
in
the
open
bible
before
him
near
them
a
young
fire
engineer
on
his
way
to
mexico
and
of
the
same
religion
as
the
rest
of
the
group
none
of
them
were
saved
it
may
be
noted
here
that
the
percentage
of
men
saved
in
the
is
the
lowest
of
any
other
division
only
eight
per
cent
many
other
faces
recur
to
thought
but
it
is
impossible
to
describe
them
all
in
the
space
of
a
short
book
of
all
those
in
the
library
that
sunday
afternoon
i
can
remember
only
two
or
three
persons
who
found
their
way
to
the
carpathia
looking
over
this
room
with
his
back
to
the
library
shelves
is
the
library
steward
thin
stooping
and
generally
with
nothing
to
do
but
serve
out
books
but
this
afternoon
he
is
busier
than
i
have
ever
seen
him
serving
out
baggage
for
passengers
to
fill
in
mine
is
before
me
as
i
write
form
for
nonresidents
in
the
united
states
steamship
titanic
no
d
etc
i
had
filled
it
in
that
afternoon
and
slipped
it
in
my
instead
of
returning
it
to
the
steward
before
me
too
is
a
small
cardboard
square
white
star
line
titanic
this
label
must
be
given
up
when
the
article
is
returned
the
property
will
be
deposited
in
the
purser
safe
the
company
will
not
be
liable
to
passengers
for
the
loss
of
money
jewels
or
ornaments
by
theft
or
otherwise
not
so
deposited
the
property
deposited
in
my
case
was
money
placed
in
an
envelope
sealed
with
my
name
written
across
the
flap
and
handed
to
the
purser
the
label
is
my
receipt
along
with
other
similar
envelopes
it
may
be
still
intact
in
the
safe
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
in
all
probability
it
is
not
as
will
be
seen
presently
after
dinner
carter
invited
all
who
wished
to
the
saloon
and
with
the
assistance
at
the
piano
of
a
gentleman
who
sat
at
the
purser
table
opposite
me
a
young
scotch
engineer
going
out
to
join
his
brother
at
the
foot
of
the
rockies
he
started
some
hundred
passengers
singing
hymns
they
were
asked
to
choose
whichever
hymn
they
wished
and
with
so
many
to
choose
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
do
more
than
have
the
greatest
favourites
sung
as
he
announced
each
hymn
it
was
evident
that
he
was
thoroughly
versed
in
their
history
no
hymn
was
sung
but
that
he
gave
a
short
sketch
of
its
author
and
in
some
cases
a
description
of
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
composed
i
think
all
were
impressed
with
his
knowledge
of
hymns
and
with
his
eagerness
to
tell
us
all
he
knew
of
them
it
was
curious
to
see
how
many
chose
hymns
dealing
with
dangers
at
sea
i
noticed
the
hushed
tone
with
which
all
sang
the
hymn
for
those
in
peril
on
the
sea
the
singing
must
have
gone
on
until
after
ten
when
seeing
the
stewards
standing
about
waiting
to
serve
biscuits
and
coffee
before
going
off
duty
carter
brought
the
evening
to
a
close
by
a
few
words
of
thanks
to
the
purser
for
the
use
of
the
saloon
a
short
sketch
of
the
happiness
and
safety
of
the
voyage
hitherto
the
great
confidence
all
felt
on
board
this
great
liner
with
her
steadiness
and
her
size
and
the
happy
outlook
of
landing
in
a
few
hours
in
new
york
at
the
close
of
a
delightful
voyage
and
all
the
time
he
spoke
a
few
miles
ahead
of
us
lay
the
peril
on
the
sea
that
was
to
sink
this
same
great
liner
with
many
of
those
on
board
who
listened
with
gratitude
to
his

much

it

have
the

retired
to

about
quarter
to
eleven
they
were

it
may
be
a
matter
of
pleasure
to
many
people
to
know
that
their
friends
were
perhaps
among
that
gathering
of
people
in

and
that
at
the

the
sound
of
the
hymns
still
echoed
in

ears

they
stood
on

deck

quietly

courageously
who
can

had

chapter
iii
the
collision
and
embarkation
in
lifeboats
i
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
secure
a
cabin
to
myself
d
quite
close
to
the
saloon
and
most
convenient
in
every
way
for
getting
about
the
ship
and
on
a
big
ship
like
the
titanic
it
was
quite
a
consideration
to
be
on
d
deck
only
three
decks
below
the
top
or
below
d
again
were
cabins
on
e
and
f
decks
and
to
walk
from
a
cabin
on
f
up
to
the
top
deck
climbing
five
flights
of
stairs
on
the
way
was
certainly
a
considerable
task
for
those
not
able
to
take
much
exercise
the
titanic
management
has
been
criticised
among
other
things
for
supplying
the
boat
with
lifts
it
has
been
said
they
were
an
expensive
luxury
and
the
room
they
took
up
might
have
been
utilized
in
some
way
for
more
appliances
whatever
else
may
have
been
superfluous
lifts
certainly
were
not
old
ladies
for
example
in
cabins
on
f
deck
would
hardly
have
got
to
the
top
deck
during
the
whole
voyage
had
they
not
been
able
to
ring
for
the
perhaps
nothing
gave
one
a
greater
impression
of
the
size
of
the
ship
than
to
take
the
lift
from
the
top
and
drop
slowly
down
past
the
different
floors
discharging
and
taking
in
passengers
just
as
in
a
large
hotel
i
wonder
where
the
was
that
night
i
would
have
been
glad
to
find
him
in
our
boat
or
on
the
carpathia
when
we
took
count
of
the
saved
he
was
quite
young
not
more
than
sixteen
i
think
a
handsome
boy
with
a
love
for
the
sea
and
the
games
on
deck
and
the
view
over
the
ocean
and
he
did
not
get
any
of
them
one
day
as
he
put
me
out
of
his
lift
and
saw
through
the
vestibule
windows
a
game
of
deck
quoits
in
progress
he
said
in
a
wistful
tone
my
i
wish
i
could
go
out
there
sometimes
i
wished
he
could
too
and
made
a
jesting
offer
to
take
charge
of
his
lift
for
an
hour
while
he
went
out
to
watch
the
game
but
he
smilingly
shook
his
head
and
dropped
down
in
answer
to
an
imperative
ring
from
below
i
think
he
was
not
on
duty
with
his
lift
after
the
collision
but
if
he
were
he
would
smile
at
his
passengers
all
the
time
as
he
took
them
up
to
the
boats
waiting
to
leave
the
sinking
ship
after
undressing
and
climbing
into
the
top
berth
i
read
from
about
eleven
to
the
time
we
struck
about
quarter
to
twelve
during
this
time
i
noticed
particularly
the
increased
vibration
of
the
ship
and
i
assumed
that
we
were
going
at
a
higher
speed
than
at
any
other
time
since
we
sailed
from
queenstown
now
i
am
aware
that
this
is
an
important
point
and
bears
strongly
on
the
question
of
responsibility
for
the
effects
of
the
collision
but
the
impression
of
increased
vibration
is
fixed
in
my
memory
so
strongly
that
it
seems
important
to
record
it
two
things
led
me
to
this
conclusion
first
that
as
i
sat
on
the
sofa
undressing
with
bare
feet
on
the
floor
the
jar
of
the
vibration
came
up
from
the
engines
below
very
noticeably
and
second
that
as
i
sat
up
in
the
berth
reading
the
spring
mattress
supporting
me
was
vibrating
more
rapidly
than
usual
this
motion
was
always
noticeable
as
one
lay
in
bed
but
that
night
there
was
certainly
a
marked
increase
in
the
motion
referring
to
the
plan
footnote
see
figure
page
it
will
be
seen
that
the
vibration
must
have
come
almost
directly
up
from
below
when
it
is
mentioned
that
the
saloon
was
immediately
above
the
engines
as
shown
in
the
plan
and
my
cabin
next
to
the
saloon
from
these
two
data
on
the
assumption
that
greater
vibration
is
an
indication
of
higher
speed
and
i
suppose
it
must
be
then
i
am
sure
we
were
going
faster
that
night
at
the
time
we
struck
the
iceberg
than
we
had
done
before
during
the
hours
i
was
awake
and
able
to
take
note
of
anything
and
then
as
i
read
in
the
quietness
of
the
night
broken
only
by
the
muffled
sound
that
came
to
me
through
the
ventilators
of
stewards
talking
and
moving
along
the
corridors
when
nearly
all
the
passengers
were
in
their
cabins
some
asleep
in
bed
others
undressing
and
others
only
just
down
from
the
and
still
discussing
many
things
there
came
what
seemed
to
me
nothing
more
than
an
extra
heave
of
the
engines
and
a
more
than
usually
obvious
dancing
motion
of
the
mattress
on
which
i
sat
nothing
more
than
that
no
sound
of
a
crash
or
of
anything
else
no
sense
of
shock
no
jar
that
felt
like
one
heavy
body
meeting
another
and
presently
the
same
thing
repeated
with
about
the
same
intensity
the
thought
came
to
me
that
they
must
have
still
further
increased
the
speed
and
all
this
time
the
titanic
was
being
cut
open
by
the
iceberg
and
water
was
pouring
in
her
side
and
yet
no
evidence
that
would
indicate
such
a
disaster
had
been
presented
to
us
it
fills
me
with
astonishment
now
to
think
of
it
consider
the
question
of
list
alone
here
was
this
enormous
vessel
running
on
to
an
iceberg
and
a
passenger
sitting
quietly
in
bed
reading
felt
no
motion
or
list
to
the
opposite
or
port
side
and
this
must
have
been
felt
had
it
been
more
than
the
usual
roll
of
the
ship
never
very
much
in
the
calm
weather
we
had
all
the
way
again
my
bunk
was
fixed
to
the
wall
on
the
starboard
side
and
any
list
to
port
would
have
tended
to
fling
me
out
on
the
floor
i
am
sure
i
should
have
noted
it
had
there
been
any
and
yet
the
explanation
is
simple
enough
the
titanic
struck
the
berg
with
a
force
of
impact
of
over
a
million
her
plates
were
less
than
an
inch
thick
and
they
must
have
been
cut
through
as
a
knife
cuts
paper
there
would
be
no
need
to
list
it
would
have
been
better
if
she
had
listed
and
thrown
us
out
on
the
floor
for
it
would
have
been
an
indication
that
our
plates
were
strong
enough
to
offer
at
any
rate
some
resistance
to
the
blow
and
we
might
all
have
been
safe
and
so
with
no
thought
of
anything
serious
having
happened
to
the
ship
i
continued
my
reading
and
still
the
murmur
from
the
stewards
and
from
adjoining
cabins
and
no
other
sound
no
cry
in
the
night
no
alarm
given
no
one
afraid
there
was
then
nothing
which
could
cause
fear
to
the
most
timid
person
but
in
a
few
moments
i
felt
the
engines
slow
and
stop
the
dancing
motion
and
the
vibration
ceased
suddenly
after
being
part
of
our
very
existence
for
four
days
and
that
was
the
first
hint
that
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
had
happened
we
have
all
heard
a
clock
stop
suddenly
in
a
quiet
room
and
then
have
noticed
the
clock
and
the
ticking
noise
of
which
we
seemed
until
then
quite
unconscious
so
in
the
same
way
the
fact
was
suddenly
brought
home
to
all
in
the
ship
that
the
engines
that
part
of
the
ship
that
drove
us
through
the
sea
had
stopped
dead
but
the
stopping
of
the
engines
gave
us
no
information
we
had
to
make
our
own
calculations
as
to
why
we
had
stopped
like
a
flash
it
came
to
me
we
have
dropped
a
propeller
blade
when
this
happens
the
engines
always
race
away
until
they
are
controlled
and
this
accounts
for
the
extra
heave
they
gave
not
a
very
logical
conclusion
when
considered
now
for
the
engines
should
have
continued
to
heave
all
the
time
until
we
stopped
but
it
was
at
the
time
a
sufficiently
tenable
hypothesis
to
hold
acting
on
it
i
jumped
out
of
bed
slipped
on
a
over
pyjamas
put
on
shoes
and
went
out
of
my
cabin
into
the
hall
near
the
saloon
here
was
a
steward
leaning
against
the
staircase
probably
waiting
until
those
in
the
above
had
gone
to
bed
and
he
could
put
out
the
lights
i
said
why
have
we
stopped
i
do
know
sir
he
replied
but
i
do
suppose
it
is
anything
much
well
i
said
i
am
going
on
deck
to
see
what
it
is
and
started
towards
the
stairs
he
smiled
indulgently
at
me
as
i
passed
him
and
said
all
right
sir
but
it
is
mighty
cold
up
there
i
am
sure
at
that
time
he
thought
i
was
rather
foolish
to
go
up
with
so
little
reason
and
i
must
confess
i
felt
rather
absurd
for
not
remaining
in
the
cabin
it
seemed
like
making
a
needless
fuss
to
walk
about
the
ship
in
a
but
it
was
my
first
trip
across
the
sea
i
had
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
and
was
keenly
alive
to
note
every
new
experience
and
certainly
to
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
with
a
propeller
dropped
seemed
sufficient
reason
for
going
on
deck
and
yet
the
steward
with
his
fatherly
smile
and
the
fact
that
no
one
else
was
about
the
passages
or
going
upstairs
to
reconnoitre
made
me
feel
guilty
in
an
undefined
way
of
breaking
some
code
of
a
régime
an
englishman
fear
of
being
thought
unusual
perhaps
i
climbed
the
three
flights
of
stairs
opened
the
vestibule
door
leading
to
the
top
deck
and
stepped
out
into
an
atmosphere
that
cut
me
clad
as
i
was
like
a
knife
walking
to
the
starboard
side
i
peered
over
and
saw
the
sea
many
feet
below
calm
and
black
forward
the
deserted
deck
stretching
away
to
the
quarters
and
the
captain
bridge
and
behind
the
steerage
quarters
and
the
stern
bridge
nothing
more
no
iceberg
on
either
side
or
astern
as
far
as
we
could
see
in
the
darkness
there
were
two
or
three
men
on
deck
and
with
one
the
scotch
engineer
who
played
hymns
in
the
saloon
i
compared
notes
of
our
experiences
he
had
just
begun
to
undress
when
the
engines
stopped
and
had
come
up
at
once
so
that
he
was
fairly
none
of
us
could
see
anything
and
all
being
quiet
and
still
the
scotchman
and
i
went
down
to
the
next
deck
through
the
windows
of
the
we
saw
a
game
of
cards
going
on
with
several
onlookers
and
went
in
to
enquire
if
they
knew
more
than
we
did
they
had
apparently
felt
rather
more
of
the
heaving
motion
but
so
far
as
i
remember
none
of
them
had
gone
out
on
deck
to
make
any
enquiries
even
when
one
of
them
had
seen
through
the
windows
an
iceberg
go
by
towering
above
the
decks
he
had
called
their
attention
to
it
and
they
all
watched
it
disappear
but
had
then
at
once
resumed
the
game
we
asked
them
the
height
of
the
berg
and
some
said
one
hundred
feet
others
sixty
feet
one
of
the
onlookers
a
motor
engineer
travelling
to
america
with
a
model
carburetter
he
had
filled
in
his
declaration
form
near
me
in
the
afternoon
and
had
questioned
the
library
steward
how
he
should
declare
his
patent
said
well
i
am
accustomed
to
estimating
distances
and
i
put
it
at
between
eighty
and
ninety
feet
we
accepted
his
estimate
and
made
guesses
as
to
what
had
happened
to
the
titanic
the
general
impression
was
that
we
had
just
scraped
the
iceberg
with
a
glancing
blow
on
the
starboard
side
and
they
had
stopped
as
a
wise
precaution
to
examine
her
thoroughly
all
over
i
expect
the
iceberg
has
scratched
off
some
of
her
new
paint
said
one
and
the
captain
does
like
to
go
on
until
she
is
painted
up
again
we
laughed
at
his
estimate
of
the
captain
care
for
the
ship
poor
captain
smith
he
knew
by
this
time
only
too
well
what
had
happened
one
of
the
players
pointing
to
his
glass
of
whiskey
standing
at
his
elbow
and
turning
to
an
onlooker
said
just
run
along
the
deck
and
see
if
any
ice
has
come
aboard
i
would
like
some
for
this
amid
the
general
laughter
at
what
we
thought
was
his
imagination
only
too
realistic
alas
for
when
he
spoke
the
forward
deck
was
covered
with
ice
that
had
tumbled
over
and
seeing
that
no
more
information
was
forthcoming
i
left
the
and
went
down
to
my
cabin
where
i
sat
for
some
time
reading
again
i
am
filled
with
sorrow
to
think
i
never
saw
any
of
the
occupants
of
that
again
nearly
all
young
men
full
of
hope
for
their
prospects
in
a
new
world
mostly
unmarried
keen
alert
with
the
makings
of
good
citizens
presently
hearing
people
walking
about
the
corridors
i
looked
out
and
saw
several
standing
in
the
hall
talking
to
a
steward
most
of
them
ladies
in
other
people
were
going
upstairs
and
i
decided
to
go
on
deck
again
but
as
it
was
too
cold
to
do
so
in
a
i
dressed
in
a
norfolk
jacket
and
trousers
and
walked
up
there
were
now
more
people
looking
over
the
side
and
walking
about
questioning
each
other
as
to
why
we
had
stopped
but
without
obtaining
any
definite
information
i
stayed
on
deck
some
minutes
walking
about
vigorously
to
keep
warm
and
occasionally
looking
downwards
to
the
sea
as
if
something
there
would
indicate
the
reason
for
delay
the
ship
had
now
resumed
her
course
moving
very
slowly
through
the
water
with
a
little
white
line
of
foam
on
each
side
i
think
we
were
all
glad
to
see
this
it
seemed
better
than
standing
still
i
soon
decided
to
go
down
again
and
as
i
crossed
from
the
starboard
to
the
port
side
to
go
down
by
the
vestibule
door
i
saw
an
officer
climb
on
the
last
lifeboat
on
the
port
side
number
and
begin
to
throw
off
the
cover
but
i
do
not
remember
that
any
one
paid
any
particular
attention
to
him
certainly
no
one
thought
they
were
preparing
to
man
the
lifeboats
and
embark
from
the
ship
all
this
time
there
was
no
apprehension
of
any
danger
in
the
minds
of
passengers
and
no
one
was
in
any
condition
of
panic
or
hysteria
after
all
it
would
have
been
strange
if
they
had
been
without
any
definite
evidence
of
danger
as
i
passed
to
the
door
to
go
down
i
looked
forward
again
and
saw
to
my
surprise
an
undoubted
tilt
downwards
from
the
stern
to
the
bows
only
a
slight
slope
which
i
do
think
any
one
had
noticed
at
any
rate
they
had
not
remarked
on
it
as
i
went
downstairs
a
confirmation
of
this
tilting
forward
came
in
something
unusual
about
the
stairs
a
curious
sense
of
something
out
of
balance
and
of
not
being
able
to
put
one
feet
down
in
the
right
place
naturally
being
tilted
forward
the
stairs
would
slope
downwards
at
an
angle
and
tend
to
throw
one
forward
i
could
not
see
any
visible
slope
of
the
stairway
it
was
perceptible
only
by
the
sense
of
balance
at
this
time
on
d
deck
were
three
ladies
i
think
they
were
all
saved
and
it
is
a
good
thing
at
least
to
be
able
to
chronicle
meeting
some
one
who
was
saved
after
so
much
record
of
those
who
were
not
standing
in
the
passage
near
the
cabin
oh
why
have
we
stopped
they
said
we
did
stop
i
replied
but
we
are
now
going
on
oh
no
one
replied
i
can
not
feel
the
engines
as
i
usually
do
or
hear
them
listen
we
listened
and
there
was
no
throb
audible
having
noticed
that
the
vibration
of
the
engines
is
most
noticeable
lying
in
a
bath
where
the
throb
comes
straight
from
the
floor
through
its
metal
sides
too
much
so
ordinarily
for
one
to
put
one
head
back
with
comfort
on
the
bath
i
took
them
along
the
corridor
to
a
bathroom
and
made
them
put
their
hands
on
the
side
of
the
bath
they
were
much
reassured
to
feel
the
engines
throbbing
down
below
and
to
know
we
were
making
some
headway
i
left
them
and
on
the
way
to
my
cabin
passed
some
stewards
standing
unconcernedly
against
the
walls
of
the
saloon
one
of
them
the
library
steward
again
was
leaning
over
a
table
writing
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
they
had
neither
any
knowledge
of
the
accident
nor
any
feeling
of
alarm
that
we
had
stopped
and
had
not
yet
gone
on
again
full
speed
their
whole
attitude
expressed
perfect
confidence
in
the
ship
and
officers
turning
into
my
gangway
my
cabin
being
the
first
in
the
gangway
i
saw
a
man
standing
at
the
other
end
of
it
fastening
his
tie
anything
fresh
he
said
not
much
i
replied
we
are
going
ahead
slowly
and
she
is
down
a
little
at
the
bows
but
i
do
think
it
is
anything
serious
come
in
and
look
at
this
man
he
laughed
he
wo
get
up
i
looked
in
and
in
the
top
bunk
lay
a
man
with
his
back
to
me
closely
wrapped
in
his
and
only
the
back
of
his
head
visible
why
wo
he
get
up
is
he
asleep
i
said
no
laughed
the
man
dressing
he
says
but
before
he
could
finish
the
sentence
the
man
above
grunted
you
do
catch
me
leaving
a
warm
bed
to
go
up
on
that
cold
deck
at
midnight
i
know
better
than
that
we
both
told
him
laughingly
why
he
had
better
get
up
but
he
was
certain
he
was
just
as
safe
there
and
all
this
dressing
was
quite
unnecessary
so
i
left
them
and
went
again
to
my
cabin
i
put
on
some
underclothing
sat
on
the
sofa
and
read
for
some
ten
minutes
when
i
heard
through
the
open
door
above
the
noise
of
people
passing
up
and
down
and
a
loud
shout
from
above
all
passengers
on
deck
with
lifebelts
on
i
placed
the
two
books
i
was
reading
in
the
side
pockets
of
my
norfolk
jacket
picked
up
my
lifebelt
curiously
enough
i
had
taken
it
down
for
the
first
time
that
night
from
the
wardrobe
when
i
first
retired
to
my
cabin
and
my
and
walked
upstairs
tying
on
the
lifebelt
as
i
came
out
of
my
cabin
i
remember
seeing
the
assistant
with
his
foot
on
the
stairs
about
to
climb
them
whisper
to
a
steward
and
jerk
his
head
significantly
behind
him
not
that
i
thought
anything
of
it
at
the
time
but
i
have
no
doubt
he
was
telling
him
what
had
happened
up
in
the
bows
and
was
giving
him
orders
to
call
all
passengers
going
upstairs
with
other
passengers
no
one
ran
a
step
or
seemed
alarmed
we
met
two
ladies
coming
down
one
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
said
oh
i
have
no
lifebelt
will
you
come
down
to
my
cabin
and
help
me
to
find
it
i
returned
with
them
to
f
deck
the
lady
who
had
addressed
me
holding
my
arm
all
the
time
in
a
grip
much
to
my
amusement
and
we
found
a
steward
in
her
gangway
who
took
them
in
and
found
their
lifebelts
coming
upstairs
again
i
passed
the
purser
window
on
f
deck
and
noticed
a
light
inside
when
halfway
up
to
e
deck
i
heard
the
heavy
metallic
clang
of
the
safe
door
followed
by
a
hasty
step
retreating
along
the
corridor
towards
the
quarters
i
have
little
doubt
it
was
the
purser
who
had
taken
all
valuables
from
his
safe
and
was
transferring
them
to
the
charge
of
the
purser
in
the
hope
they
might
all
be
saved
in
one
package
that
is
why
i
said
above
that
perhaps
the
envelope
containing
my
money
was
not
in
the
safe
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
it
is
probably
in
a
bundle
with
many
others
like
it
waterlogged
at
the
bottom
reaching
the
top
deck
we
found
many
people
assembled
there
some
fully
dressed
with
coats
and
wraps
for
anything
that
might
happen
others
who
had
thrown
wraps
hastily
round
them
when
they
were
called
or
heard
the
summons
to
equip
themselves
with
lifebelts
not
in
much
condition
to
face
the
cold
of
that
night
fortunately
there
was
no
wind
to
beat
the
cold
air
through
our
clothing
even
the
breeze
caused
by
the
ship
motion
had
died
entirely
away
for
the
engines
had
stopped
again
and
the
titanic
lay
peacefully
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
motionless
quiet
not
even
rocking
to
the
roll
of
the
sea
indeed
as
we
were
to
discover
presently
the
sea
was
as
calm
as
an
inland
lake
save
for
the
gentle
swell
which
could
impart
no
motion
to
a
ship
the
size
of
the
titanic
to
stand
on
the
deck
many
feet
above
the
water
lapping
idly
against
her
sides
and
looking
much
farther
off
than
it
really
was
because
of
the
darkness
gave
one
a
sense
of
wonderful
security
to
feel
her
so
steady
and
still
was
like
standing
on
a
large
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
but
there
were
now
more
evidences
of
the
coming
catastrophe
to
the
observer
than
had
been
apparent
when
on
deck
last
one
was
the
roar
and
hiss
of
escaping
steam
from
the
boilers
issuing
out
of
a
large
steam
pipe
reaching
high
up
one
of
the
funnels
a
harsh
deafening
boom
that
made
conversation
difficult
and
no
doubt
increased
the
apprehension
of
some
people
merely
because
of
the
volume
of
noise
if
one
imagines
twenty
locomotives
blowing
off
steam
in
a
low
key
it
would
give
some
idea
of
the
unpleasant
sound
that
met
us
as
we
climbed
out
on
the
top
deck
but
after
all
it
was
the
kind
of
phenomenon
we
ought
to
expect
engines
blow
off
steam
when
standing
in
a
station
and
why
should
not
a
ship
boilers
do
the
same
when
the
ship
is
not
moving
i
never
heard
any
one
connect
this
noise
with
the
danger
of
boiler
explosion
in
the
event
of
the
ship
sinking
with
her
boilers
under
a
high
pressure
of
steam
which
was
no
doubt
the
true
explanation
of
this
precaution
but
this
is
perhaps
speculation
some
people
may
have
known
it
quite
well
for
from
the
time
we
came
on
deck
until
boat
got
away
i
heard
very
little
conversation
of
any
kind
among
the
passengers
it
is
not
the
slightest
exaggeration
to
say
that
no
signs
of
alarm
were
exhibited
by
any
one
there
was
no
indication
of
panic
or
hysteria
no
cries
of
fear
and
no
running
to
and
fro
to
discover
what
was
the
matter
why
we
had
been
summoned
on
deck
with
lifebelts
and
what
was
to
be
done
with
us
now
we
were
there
we
stood
there
quietly
looking
on
at
the
work
of
the
crew
as
they
manned
the
lifeboats
and
no
one
ventured
to
interfere
with
them
or
offered
to
help
them
it
was
plain
we
should
be
of
no
use
and
the
crowd
of
men
and
women
stood
quietly
on
the
deck
or
paced
slowly
up
and
down
waiting
for
orders
from
the
officers
now
before
we
consider
any
further
the
events
that
followed
the
state
of
mind
of
passengers
at
this
juncture
and
the
motives
which
led
each
one
to
act
as
he
or
she
did
in
the
circumstances
it
is
important
to
keep
in
thought
the
amount
of
information
at
our
disposal
men
and
women
act
according
to
judgment
based
on
knowledge
of
the
conditions
around
them
and
the
best
way
to
understand
some
apparently
inconceivable
things
that
happened
is
for
any
one
to
imagine
himself
or
herself
standing
on
deck
that
night
it
seems
a
mystery
to
some
people
that
women
refused
to
leave
the
ship
that
some
persons
retired
to
their
cabins
and
so
on
but
it
is
a
matter
of
judgment
after
all
so
that
if
the
reader
will
come
and
stand
with
the
crowd
on
deck
he
must
first
rid
himself
entirely
of
the
knowledge
that
the
titanic
has
sunk
an
important
necessity
for
he
can
not
see
conditions
as
they
existed
there
through
the
mental
haze
arising
from
knowledge
of
the
greatest
maritime
tragedy
the
world
has
known
he
must
get
rid
of
any
foreknowledge
of
disaster
to
appreciate
why
people
acted
as
they
did
secondly
he
had
better
get
rid
of
any
picture
in
thought
painted
either
by
his
own
imagination
or
by
some
artist
whether
pictorial
or
verbal
from
information
supplied
some
are
most
inaccurate
these
mostly
and
where
they
err
they
err
on
the
highly
dramatic
side
they
need
not
have
done
so
the
whole
conditions
were
dramatic
enough
in
all
their
bare
simplicity
without
the
addition
of
any
high
colouring
having
made
these
mental
erasures
he
will
find
himself
as
one
of
the
crowd
faced
with
the
following
conditions
a
perfectly
still
atmosphere
a
brilliantly
beautiful
starlight
night
but
no
moon
and
so
with
little
light
that
was
of
any
use
a
ship
that
had
come
quietly
to
rest
without
any
indication
of
disaster
no
iceberg
visible
no
hole
in
the
ship
side
through
which
water
was
pouring
in
nothing
broken
or
out
of
place
no
sound
of
alarm
no
panic
no
movement
of
any
one
except
at
a
walking
pace
the
absence
of
any
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
accident
of
the
extent
of
damage
of
the
danger
of
the
ship
sinking
in
a
few
hours
of
the
numbers
of
boats
rafts
and
other
lifesaving
appliances
available
their
capacity
what
other
ships
were
near
or
coming
to
help
in
fact
an
almost
complete
absence
of
any
positive
knowledge
on
any
point
i
think
this
was
the
result
of
deliberate
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
officers
and
perhaps
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
in
particular
he
must
remember
that
the
ship
was
a
sixth
of
a
mile
long
with
passengers
on
three
decks
open
to
the
sea
and
port
and
starboard
sides
to
each
deck
he
will
then
get
some
idea
of
the
difficulty
presented
to
the
officers
of
keeping
control
over
such
a
large
area
and
the
impossibility
of
any
one
knowing
what
was
happening
except
in
his
own
immediate
vicinity
perhaps
the
whole
thing
can
be
summed
up
best
by
saying
that
after
we
had
embarked
in
the
lifeboats
and
rowed
away
from
the
titanic
it
would
not
have
surprised
us
to
hear
that
all
passengers
would
be
saved
the
cries
of
drowning
people
after
the
titanic
gave
the
final
plunge
were
a
thunderbolt
to
us
i
am
aware
that
the
experiences
of
many
of
those
saved
differed
in
some
respects
from
the
above
some
had
knowledge
of
certain
things
some
were
experienced
travellers
and
sailors
and
therefore
deduced
more
rapidly
what
was
likely
to
happen
but
i
think
the
above
gives
a
fairly
accurate
representation
of
the
state
of
mind
of
most
of
those
on
deck
that
night
all
this
time
people
were
pouring
up
from
the
stairs
and
adding
to
the
crowd
i
remember
at
that
moment
thinking
it
would
be
well
to
return
to
my
cabin
and
rescue
some
money
and
warmer
clothing
if
we
were
to
embark
in
boats
but
looking
through
the
vestibule
windows
and
seeing
people
still
coming
upstairs
i
decided
it
would
only
cause
confusion
passing
them
on
the
stairs
and
so
remained
on
deck
i
was
now
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
top
boat
deck
the
time
about
we
watched
the
crew
at
work
on
the
lifeboats
numbers
some
inside
arranging
the
oars
some
coiling
ropes
on
the
deck
the
ropes
which
ran
through
the
pulleys
to
lower
to
the
sea
others
with
cranks
fitted
to
the
rocking
arms
of
the
davits
as
we
watched
the
cranks
were
turned
the
davits
swung
outwards
until
the
boats
hung
clear
of
the
edge
of
the
deck
just
then
an
officer
came
along
from
the
deck
and
shouted
above
the
noise
of
escaping
steam
all
women
and
children
get
down
to
deck
below
and
all
men
stand
back
from
the
boats
he
had
apparently
been
off
duty
when
the
ship
struck
and
was
lightly
dressed
with
a
white
muffler
twisted
hastily
round
his
neck
the
men
fell
back
and
the
women
retired
below
to
get
into
the
boats
from
the
next
deck
two
women
refused
at
first
to
leave
their
husbands
but
partly
by
persuasion
and
partly
by
force
they
were
separated
from
them
and
sent
down
to
the
next
deck
i
think
that
by
this
time
the
work
on
the
lifeboats
and
the
separation
of
men
and
women
impressed
on
us
slowly
the
presence
of
imminent
danger
but
it
made
no
difference
in
the
attitude
of
the
crowd
they
were
just
as
prepared
to
obey
orders
and
to
do
what
came
next
as
when
they
first
came
on
deck
i
do
not
mean
that
they
actually
reasoned
it
out
they
were
the
average
teutonic
crowd
with
an
inborn
respect
for
law
and
order
and
for
traditions
bequeathed
to
them
by
generations
of
ancestors
the
reasons
that
made
them
act
as
they
did
were
impersonal
instinctive
hereditary
but
if
there
were
any
one
who
had
not
by
now
realized
that
the
ship
was
in
danger
all
doubt
on
this
point
was
to
be
set
at
rest
in
a
dramatic
manner
suddenly
a
rush
of
light
from
the
forward
deck
a
hissing
roar
that
made
us
all
turn
from
watching
the
boats
and
a
rocket
leapt
upwards
to
where
the
stars
blinked
and
twinkled
above
us
up
it
went
higher
and
higher
with
a
sea
of
faces
upturned
to
watch
it
and
then
an
explosion
that
seemed
to
split
the
silent
night
in
two
and
a
shower
of
stars
sank
slowly
down
and
went
out
one
by
one
and
with
a
gasping
sigh
one
word
escaped
the
lips
of
the
crowd
rockets
anybody
knows
what
rockets
at
sea
mean
and
presently
another
and
then
a
third
it
is
no
use
denying
the
dramatic
intensity
of
the
scene
separate
it
if
you
can
from
all
the
terrible
events
that
followed
and
picture
the
calmness
of
the
night
the
sudden
light
on
the
decks
crowded
with
people
in
different
stages
of
dress
and
undress
the
background
of
huge
funnels
and
tapering
masts
revealed
by
the
soaring
rocket
whose
flash
illumined
at
the
same
time
the
faces
and
minds
of
the
obedient
crowd
the
one
with
mere
physical
light
the
other
with
a
sudden
revelation
of
what
its
message
was
every
one
knew
without
being
told
that
we
were
calling
for
help
from
any
one
who
was
near
enough
to
see
the
crew
were
now
in
the
boats
the
sailors
standing
by
the
pulley
ropes
let
them
slip
through
the
cleats
in
jerks
and
down
the
boats
went
till
level
with
b
deck
women
and
children
climbed
over
the
rail
into
the
boats
and
filled
them
when
full
they
were
lowered
one
by
one
beginning
with
number
the
first
on
the
deck
and
working
backwards
towards
all
this
we
could
see
by
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
which
was
now
quite
open
to
the
sea
the
four
boats
which
formed
a
natural
barrier
being
lowered
from
the
deck
and
leaving
it
exposed
about
this
time
while
walking
the
deck
i
saw
two
ladies
come
over
from
the
port
side
and
walk
towards
the
rail
separating
the
from
the
deck
there
stood
an
officer
barring
the
way
may
we
pass
to
the
boats
they
said
no
madam
he
replied
politely
your
boats
are
down
on
your
own
deck
pointing
to
where
they
swung
below
the
ladies
turned
and
went
towards
the
stairway
and
no
doubt
were
able
to
enter
one
of
the
boats
they
had
ample
time
i
mention
this
to
show
that
there
was
at
any
rate
some
arrangement
whether
official
or
not
for
separating
the
classes
in
embarking
in
boats
how
far
it
was
carried
out
i
do
not
know
but
if
the
ladies
were
not
expected
to
enter
a
boat
from
the
deck
while
steerage
passengers
were
allowed
access
to
the
deck
it
would
seem
to
press
rather
hardly
on
the
men
and
this
is
rather
supported
by
the
low
percentage
saved
almost
immediately
after
this
incident
a
report
went
round
among
men
on
the
top
deck
the
starboard
side
that
men
were
to
be
taken
off
on
the
port
side
how
it
originated
i
am
quite
unable
to
say
but
can
only
suppose
that
as
the
port
boats
numbers
to
were
not
lowered
from
the
top
deck
quite
so
soon
as
the
starboard
boats
they
could
still
be
seen
on
deck
it
might
be
assumed
that
women
were
being
taken
off
on
one
side
and
men
on
the
other
but
in
whatever
way
the
report
started
it
was
acted
on
at
once
by
almost
all
the
men
who
crowded
across
to
the
port
side
and
watched
the
preparation
for
lowering
the
boats
leaving
the
starboard
side
almost
deserted
two
or
three
men
remained
however
not
for
any
reason
that
we
were
consciously
aware
of
i
can
personally
think
of
no
decision
arising
from
reasoned
thought
that
induced
me
to
remain
rather
than
to
cross
over
but
while
there
was
no
process
of
conscious
reason
at
work
i
am
convinced
that
what
was
my
salvation
was
a
recognition
of
the
necessity
of
being
quiet
and
waiting
in
patience
for
some
opportunity
of
safety
to
present
itself
soon
after
the
men
had
left
the
starboard
side
i
saw
a
bandsman
the
come
round
the
vestibule
corner
from
the
staircase
entrance
and
run
down
the
now
deserted
starboard
deck
his
trailing
behind
him
the
spike
dragging
along
the
floor
this
must
have
been
about
i
suppose
the
band
must
have
begun
to
play
soon
after
this
and
gone
on
until
after
many
brave
things
were
done
that
night
but
none
more
brave
than
by
those
few
men
playing
minute
after
minute
as
the
ship
settled
quietly
lower
and
lower
in
the
sea
and
the
sea
rose
higher
and
higher
to
where
they
stood
the
music
they
played
serving
alike
as
their
own
immortal
requiem
and
their
right
to
be
recorded
on
the
rolls
of
undying
fame
looking
forward
and
downward
we
could
see
several
of
the
boats
now
in
the
water
moving
slowly
one
by
one
from
the
side
without
confusion
or
noise
and
stealing
away
in
the
darkness
which
swallowed
them
in
turn
as
the
crew
bent
to
the
oars
an
officer
i
think
first
officer
murdock
came
striding
along
the
deck
clad
in
a
long
coat
from
his
manner
and
face
evidently
in
great
agitation
but
determined
and
resolute
he
looked
over
the
side
and
shouted
to
the
boats
being
lowered
lower
away
and
when
afloat
row
around
to
the
gangway
and
wait
for
orders
aye
aye
sir
was
the
reply
and
the
officer
passed
by
and
went
across
the
ship
to
the
port
side
almost
immediately
after
this
i
heard
a
cry
from
below
of
any
more
ladies
and
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
deck
saw
boat
swinging
level
with
the
rail
of
b
deck
with
the
crew
some
stokers
a
few
men
passengers
and
the
rest
ladies
the
latter
being
about
half
the
total
number
the
boat
was
almost
full
and
just
about
to
be
lowered
the
call
for
ladies
was
repeated
twice
again
but
apparently
there
were
none
to
be
found
just
then
one
of
the
crew
looked
up
and
saw
me
looking
over
any
ladies
on
your
deck
he
said
no
i
replied
then
you
had
better
jump
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
deck
with
my
feet
over
threw
the
which
i
had
carried
on
my
arm
all
of
the
time
into
the
boat
dropped
and
fell
in
the
boat
near
the
stern
as
i
picked
myself
up
i
heard
a
shout
wait
a
moment
here
are
two
more
ladies
and
they
were
pushed
hurriedly
over
the
side
and
tumbled
into
the
boat
one
into
the
middle
and
one
next
to
me
in
the
stern
they
told
me
afterwards
that
they
had
been
assembled
on
a
lower
deck
with
other
ladies
and
had
come
up
to
b
deck
not
by
the
usual
stairway
inside
but
by
one
of
the
vertically
upright
iron
ladders
that
connect
each
deck
with
the
one
below
it
meant
for
the
use
of
sailors
passing
about
the
ship
other
ladies
had
been
in
front
of
them
and
got
up
quickly
but
these
two
were
delayed
a
long
time
by
the
fact
that
one
of
them
the
one
that
was
helped
first
over
the
side
into
boat
near
the
middle
was
not
at
all
active
it
seemed
almost
impossible
for
her
to
climb
up
a
vertical
ladder
we
saw
her
trying
to
climb
the
swinging
rope
ladder
up
the
carpathia
side
a
few
hours
later
and
she
had
the
same
difficulty
as
they
tumbled
in
the
crew
shouted
lower
away
but
before
the
order
was
obeyed
a
man
with
his
wife
and
a
baby
came
quickly
to
the
side
the
baby
was
handed
to
the
lady
in
the
stern
the
mother
got
in
near
the
middle
and
the
father
at
the
last
moment
dropped
in
as
the
boat
began
its
journey
down
to
the
sea
many
feet
below
chapter
iv
the
sinking
of
the
titanic
seen
from
a
lifeboat
looking
back
now
on
the
descent
of
our
boat
down
the
ship
side
it
is
a
matter
of
surprise
i
think
to
all
the
occupants
to
remember
how
little
they
thought
of
it
at
the
time
it
was
a
great
adventure
certainly
it
was
exciting
to
feel
the
boat
sink
by
jerks
foot
by
foot
as
the
ropes
were
paid
out
from
above
and
shrieked
as
they
passed
through
the
pulley
blocks
the
new
ropes
and
gear
creaking
under
the
strain
of
a
boat
laden
with
people
and
the
crew
calling
to
the
sailors
above
as
the
boat
tilted
slightly
now
at
one
end
now
at
the
other
lower
aft
lower
stern
and
lower
together
as
she
came
level
again
but
i
do
not
think
we
felt
much
apprehension
about
reaching
the
water
safely
it
certainly
was
thrilling
to
see
the
black
hull
of
the
ship
on
one
side
and
the
sea
seventy
feet
below
on
the
other
or
to
pass
down
by
cabins
and
saloons
brilliantly
lighted
but
we
knew
nothing
of
the
apprehension
felt
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
officers
whether
the
boats
and
would
stand
the
strain
of
the
weight
of
our
sixty
people
the
ropes
however
were
new
and
strong
and
the
boat
did
not
buckle
in
the
middle
as
an
older
boat
might
have
done
whether
it
was
right
or
not
to
lower
boats
full
of
people
to
the
water
and
it
seems
likely
it
was
not
i
think
there
can
be
nothing
but
the
highest
praise
given
to
the
officers
and
crew
above
for
the
way
in
which
they
lowered
the
boats
one
after
the
other
safely
to
the
water
it
may
seem
a
simple
matter
to
read
about
such
a
thing
but
any
sailor
knows
apparently
that
it
is
not
so
an
experienced
officer
has
told
me
that
he
has
seen
a
boat
lowered
in
practice
from
a
ship
deck
with
a
trained
crew
and
no
passengers
in
the
boat
with
practised
sailors
paying
out
the
ropes
in
daylight
in
calm
weather
with
the
ship
lying
in
dock
and
has
seen
the
boat
tilt
over
and
pitch
the
crew
headlong
into
the
sea
contrast
these
conditions
with
those
obtaining
that
monday
morning
at
and
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
that
whether
the
lowering
crew
were
trained
or
not
whether
they
had
or
had
not
drilled
since
coming
on
board
they
did
their
duty
in
a
way
that
argues
the
greatest
efficiency
i
can
not
help
feeling
the
deepest
gratitude
to
the
two
sailors
who
stood
at
the
ropes
above
and
lowered
us
to
the
sea
i
do
not
suppose
they
were
saved
perhaps
one
explanation
of
our
feeling
little
sense
of
the
unusual
in
leaving
the
titanic
in
this
way
was
that
it
seemed
the
climax
to
a
series
of
extraordinary
occurrences
the
magnitude
of
the
whole
thing
dwarfed
events
that
in
the
ordinary
way
would
seem
to
be
full
of
imminent
peril
it
is
easy
to
imagine
it
a
voyage
of
four
days
on
a
calm
sea
without
a
single
untoward
incident
the
presumption
perhaps
already
mentally
half
realized
that
we
should
be
ashore
in
hours
and
so
complete
a
splendid
voyage
and
then
to
feel
the
engine
stop
to
be
summoned
on
deck
with
little
time
to
dress
to
tie
on
a
lifebelt
to
see
rockets
shooting
aloft
in
call
for
help
to
be
told
to
get
into
a
lifeboat
after
all
these
things
it
did
not
seem
much
to
feel
the
boat
sinking
down
to
the
sea
it
was
the
natural
sequence
of
previous
events
and
we
had
learned
in
the
last
hour
to
take
things
just
as
they
came
at
the
same
time
if
any
one
should
wonder
what
the
sensation
is
like
it
is
quite
easy
to
measure
feet
from
the
windows
of
a
tall
house
or
a
block
of
flats
look
down
to
the
ground
and
fancy
himself
with
some
sixty
other
people
crowded
into
a
boat
so
tightly
that
he
could
not
sit
down
or
move
about
and
then
picture
the
boat
sinking
down
in
a
continuous
series
of
jerks
as
the
sailors
pay
out
the
ropes
through
cleats
above
there
are
more
pleasant
sensations
than
this
how
thankful
we
were
that
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
titanic
lay
so
steadily
and
quietly
as
we
dropped
down
her
side
we
were
spared
the
bumping
and
grinding
against
the
side
which
so
often
accompanies
the
launching
of
boats
i
do
not
remember
that
we
even
had
to
fend
off
our
boat
while
we
were
trying
to
get
free
as
we
went
down
one
of
the
crew
shouted
we
are
just
over
the
condenser
exhaust
we
do
want
to
stay
in
that
long
or
we
shall
be
swamped
feel
down
on
the
floor
and
be
ready
to
pull
up
the
pin
which
lets
the
ropes
free
as
soon
as
we
are
afloat
i
had
often
looked
over
the
side
and
noticed
this
stream
of
water
coming
out
of
the
side
of
the
titanic
just
above
the
in
fact
so
large
was
the
volume
of
water
that
as
we
ploughed
along
and
met
the
waves
coming
towards
us
this
stream
would
cause
a
splash
that
sent
spray
flying
we
felt
as
well
as
we
could
in
the
crowd
of
people
on
the
floor
along
the
sides
with
no
idea
where
the
pin
could
be
found
and
none
of
the
crew
knew
where
it
was
only
of
its
existence
somewhere
but
we
never
found
it
and
all
the
time
we
got
closer
to
the
sea
and
the
exhaust
roared
nearer
and
nearer
until
finally
we
floated
with
the
ropes
still
holding
us
from
above
the
exhaust
washing
us
away
and
the
force
of
the
tide
driving
us
back
against
the
side
the
latter
not
of
much
account
in
influencing
the
direction
however
thinking
over
what
followed
i
imagine
we
must
have
touched
the
water
with
the
condenser
stream
at
our
bows
and
not
in
the
middle
as
i
thought
at
one
time
at
any
rate
the
resultant
of
these
three
forces
was
that
we
were
carried
parallel
to
the
ship
directly
under
the
place
where
boat
would
drop
from
her
davits
into
the
sea
looking
up
we
saw
her
already
coming
down
rapidly
from
b
deck
she
must
have
filled
almost
immediately
after
ours
we
shouted
up
stop
lowering
footnote
in
an
account
which
appeared
in
the
newspapers
of
april
i
have
described
this
boat
as
not
knowing
they
were
numbered
alternately
and
the
crew
and
passengers
in
the
boat
above
hearing
us
shout
and
seeing
our
position
immediately
below
them
shouted
the
same
to
the
sailors
on
the
boat
deck
but
apparently
they
did
not
hear
for
she
dropped
down
foot
by
foot
twenty
feet
fifteen
ten
and
a
stoker
and
i
in
the
bows
reached
up
and
touched
her
bottom
swinging
above
our
heads
trying
to
push
away
our
boat
from
under
her
it
seemed
now
as
if
nothing
could
prevent
her
dropping
on
us
but
at
this
moment
another
stoker
sprang
with
his
knife
to
the
ropes
that
still
held
us
and
i
heard
him
shout
one
two
as
he
cut
them
through
the
next
moment
we
had
swung
away
from
underneath
and
were
clear
of
her
as
she
dropped
into
the
water
in
the
space
we
had
just
before
occupied
i
do
not
know
how
the
bow
ropes
were
freed
but
imagine
that
they
were
cut
in
the
same
way
for
we
were
washed
clear
of
the
titanic
at
once
by
the
force
of
the
stream
and
floated
away
as
the
oars
were
got
out
i
think
we
all
felt
that
that
was
quite
the
most
exciting
thing
we
had
yet
been
through
and
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
gratitude
went
up
as
we
swung
away
from
the
boat
above
our
heads
but
i
heard
no
one
cry
aloud
during
the
experience
not
a
woman
voice
was
raised
in
fear
or
hysteria
i
think
we
all
learnt
many
things
that
night
about
the
bogey
called
fear
and
how
the
facing
of
it
is
much
less
than
the
dread
of
it
the
crew
was
made
up
of
cooks
and
stewards
mostly
the
former
i
think
their
white
jackets
showing
up
in
the
darkness
as
they
pulled
away
two
to
an
oar
i
do
not
think
they
can
have
had
any
practice
in
rowing
for
all
night
long
their
oars
crossed
and
clashed
if
our
safety
had
depended
on
speed
or
accuracy
in
keeping
time
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
us
shouting
began
from
one
end
of
the
boat
to
the
other
as
to
what
we
should
do
where
we
should
go
and
no
one
seemed
to
have
any
knowledge
how
to
act
at
last
we
asked
who
is
in
charge
of
this
boat
but
there
was
no
reply
we
then
agreed
by
general
consent
that
the
stoker
who
stood
in
the
stern
with
the
tiller
should
act
as
captain
and
from
that
time
he
directed
the
course
shouting
to
other
boats
and
keeping
in
touch
with
them
not
that
there
was
anywhere
to
go
or
anything
we
could
do
our
plan
of
action
was
simple
to
keep
all
the
boats
together
as
far
as
possible
and
wait
until
we
were
picked
up
by
other
liners
the
crew
had
apparently
heard
of
the
wireless
communications
before
they
left
the
titanic
but
i
never
heard
them
say
that
we
were
in
touch
with
any
boat
but
the
olympic
it
was
always
the
olympic
that
was
coming
to
our
rescue
they
thought
they
knew
even
her
distance
and
making
a
calculation
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
ought
to
be
picked
up
by
her
about
two
in
the
afternoon
but
this
was
not
our
only
hope
of
rescue
we
watched
all
the
time
the
darkness
lasted
for
steamers
lights
thinking
there
might
be
a
chance
of
other
steamers
coming
near
enough
to
see
the
lights
which
some
of
our
boats
carried
i
am
sure
there
was
no
feeling
in
the
minds
of
any
one
that
we
should
not
be
picked
up
next
day
we
knew
that
wireless
messages
would
go
out
from
ship
to
ship
and
as
one
of
the
stokers
said
the
sea
will
be
covered
with
ships
afternoon
they
will
race
up
from
all
over
the
sea
to
find
us
some
even
thought
that
fast
torpedo
boats
might
run
up
ahead
of
the
olympic
and
yet
the
olympic
was
after
all
the
farthest
away
of
them
all
eight
other
ships
lay
within
three
hundred
miles
of
us
how
thankful
we
should
have
been
to
know
how
near
help
was
and
how
many
ships
had
heard
our
message
and
were
rushing
to
the
aid
i
think
nothing
has
surprised
us
more
than
to
learn
so
many
ships
were
near
enough
to
rescue
us
in
a
few
hours
almost
immediately
after
leaving
the
titanic
we
saw
what
we
all
said
was
a
ship
lights
down
on
the
horizon
on
the
titanic
port
side
two
lights
one
above
the
other
and
plainly
not
one
of
our
boats
we
even
rowed
in
that
direction
for
some
time
but
the
lights
drew
away
and
disappeared
below
the
horizon
but
this
is
rather
anticipating
we
did
none
of
these
things
first
we
had
no
eyes
for
anything
but
the
ship
we
had
just
left
as
the
oarsmen
pulled
slowly
away
we
all
turned
and
took
a
long
look
at
the
mighty
vessel
towering
high
above
our
midget
boat
and
i
know
it
must
have
been
the
most
extraordinary
sight
i
shall
ever
be
called
upon
to
witness
i
realize
now
how
totally
inadequate
language
is
to
convey
to
some
other
person
who
was
not
there
any
real
impression
of
what
we
saw
but
the
task
must
be
attempted
the
whole
picture
is
so
intensely
dramatic
that
while
it
is
not
possible
to
place
on
paper
for
eyes
to
see
the
actual
likeness
of
the
ship
as
she
lay
there
some
sketch
of
the
scene
will
be
possible
first
of
all
the
climatic
conditions
were
extraordinary
the
night
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
i
have
ever
seen
the
sky
without
a
single
cloud
to
mar
the
perfect
brilliance
of
the
stars
clustered
so
thickly
together
that
in
places
there
seemed
almost
more
dazzling
points
of
light
set
in
the
black
sky
than
background
of
sky
itself
and
each
star
seemed
in
the
keen
atmosphere
free
from
any
haze
to
have
increased
its
brilliance
tenfold
and
to
twinkle
and
glitter
with
a
staccato
flash
that
made
the
sky
seem
nothing
but
a
setting
made
for
them
in
which
to
display
their
wonder
they
seemed
so
near
and
their
light
so
much
more
intense
than
ever
before
that
fancy
suggested
they
saw
this
beautiful
ship
in
dire
distress
below
and
all
their
energies
had
awakened
to
flash
messages
across
the
black
dome
of
the
sky
to
each
other
telling
and
warning
of
the
calamity
happening
in
the
world
beneath
later
when
the
titanic
had
gone
down
and
we
lay
still
on
the
sea
waiting
for
the
day
to
dawn
or
a
ship
to
come
i
remember
looking
up
at
the
perfect
sky
and
realizing
why
shakespeare
wrote
the
beautiful
words
he
puts
in
the
mouth
of
lorenzo
jessica
look
how
the
floor
of
heaven
is
thick
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
there
not
the
smallest
orb
which
thou
but
in
his
motion
like
an
angel
sings
still
quiring
to
the
cherubims
such
harmony
is
in
immortal
souls
but
whilst
this
muddy
vesture
of
decay
doth
grossly
close
it
in
we
can
not
hear
it
but
it
seemed
almost
as
if
we
could
that
night
the
stars
seemed
really
to
be
alive
and
to
talk
the
complete
absence
of
haze
produced
a
phenomenon
i
had
never
seen
before
where
the
sky
met
the
sea
the
line
was
as
clear
and
definite
as
the
edge
of
a
knife
so
that
the
water
and
the
air
never
merged
gradually
into
each
other
and
blended
to
a
softened
rounded
horizon
but
each
element
was
so
exclusively
separate
that
where
a
star
came
low
down
in
the
sky
near
the
edge
of
the
waterline
it
still
lost
none
of
its
brilliance
as
the
earth
revolved
and
the
water
edge
came
up
and
covered
partially
the
star
as
it
were
it
simply
cut
the
star
in
two
the
upper
half
continuing
to
sparkle
as
long
as
it
was
not
entirely
hidden
and
throwing
a
long
beam
of
light
along
the
sea
to
us
in
the
evidence
before
the
united
states
senate
committee
the
captain
of
one
of
the
ships
near
us
that
night
said
the
stars
were
so
extraordinarily
bright
near
the
horizon
that
he
was
deceived
into
thinking
that
they
were
ships
lights
he
did
not
remember
seeing
such
a
night
before
those
who
were
afloat
will
all
agree
with
that
statement
were
often
deceived
into
thinking
they
were
lights
of
a
ship
and
next
the
cold
air
here
again
was
something
quite
new
to
us
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
to
blow
keenly
round
us
as
we
stood
in
the
boat
and
because
of
its
continued
persistence
to
make
us
feel
cold
it
was
just
a
keen
bitter
icy
motionless
cold
that
came
from
nowhere
and
yet
was
there
all
the
time
the
stillness
of
it
if
one
can
imagine
cold
being
motionless
and
still
was
what
seemed
new
and
strange
and
these
the
sky
and
the
air
were
overhead
and
below
was
the
sea
here
again
something
uncommon
the
surface
was
like
a
lake
of
oil
heaving
gently
up
and
down
with
a
quiet
motion
that
rocked
our
boat
dreamily
to
and
fro
we
did
not
need
to
keep
her
head
to
the
swell
often
i
watched
her
lying
broadside
on
to
the
tide
and
with
a
boat
loaded
as
we
were
this
would
have
been
impossible
with
anything
like
a
swell
the
sea
slipped
away
smoothly
under
the
boat
and
i
think
we
never
heard
it
lapping
on
the
sides
so
oily
in
appearance
was
the
water
so
when
one
of
the
stokers
said
he
had
been
to
sea
for
years
and
never
yet
seen
such
a
calm
night
we
accepted
it
as
true
without
comment
just
as
expressive
was
the
remark
of
another
it
reminds
me
of
a
bloomin
picnic
it
was
quite
true
it
did
a
picnic
on
a
lake
or
a
quiet
inland
river
like
the
cam
or
a
backwater
on
the
thames
and
so
in
these
conditions
of
sky
and
air
and
sea
we
gazed
broadside
on
the
titanic
from
a
short
distance
she
was
absolutely
still
indeed
from
the
first
it
seemed
as
if
the
blow
from
the
iceberg
had
taken
all
the
courage
out
of
her
and
she
had
just
come
quietly
to
rest
and
was
settling
down
without
an
effort
to
save
herself
without
a
murmur
of
protest
against
such
a
foul
blow
for
the
sea
could
not
rock
her
the
wind
was
not
there
to
howl
noisily
round
the
decks
and
make
the
ropes
hum
from
the
first
what
must
have
impressed
all
as
they
watched
was
the
sense
of
stillness
about
her
and
the
slow
insensible
way
she
sank
lower
and
lower
in
the
sea
like
a
stricken
animal
the
mere
bulk
alone
of
the
ship
viewed
from
the
sea
below
was
an
sight
imagine
a
ship
nearly
a
sixth
of
a
mile
long
feet
high
to
the
top
decks
with
four
enormous
funnels
above
the
decks
and
masts
again
high
above
the
funnels
with
her
hundreds
of
portholes
all
her
saloons
and
other
rooms
brilliant
with
light
and
all
round
her
little
boats
filled
with
those
who
until
a
few
hours
before
had
trod
her
decks
and
read
in
her
libraries
and
listened
to
the
music
of
her
band
in
happy
content
and
who
were
now
looking
up
in
amazement
at
the
enormous
mass
above
them
and
rowing
away
from
her
because
she
was
sinking
i
had
often
wanted
to
see
her
from
some
distance
away
and
only
a
few
hours
before
in
conversation
at
lunch
with
a
had
registered
a
vow
to
get
a
proper
view
of
her
lines
and
dimensions
when
we
landed
at
new
york
to
stand
some
distance
away
to
take
in
a
full
view
of
her
beautiful
proportions
which
the
narrow
approach
to
the
dock
at
southampton
made
impossible
little
did
i
think
that
the
opportunity
was
to
be
found
so
quickly
and
so
dramatically
the
background
too
was
a
different
one
from
what
i
had
planned
for
her
the
black
outline
of
her
profile
against
the
sky
was
bordered
all
round
by
stars
studded
in
the
sky
and
all
her
funnels
and
masts
were
picked
out
in
the
same
way
her
bulk
was
seen
where
the
stars
were
blotted
out
and
one
other
thing
was
different
from
expectation
the
thing
that
ripped
away
from
us
instantly
as
we
saw
it
all
sense
of
the
beauty
of
the
night
the
beauty
of
the
ship
lines
and
the
beauty
of
her
lights
and
all
these
taken
in
themselves
were
intensely
beautiful
that
thing
was
the
awful
angle
made
by
the
level
of
the
sea
with
the
rows
of
porthole
lights
along
her
side
in
dotted
lines
row
above
row
the
sea
level
and
the
rows
of
lights
should
have
been
parallel
should
never
have
met
and
now
they
met
at
an
angle
inside
the
black
hull
of
the
ship
there
was
nothing
else
to
indicate
she
was
injured
nothing
but
this
apparent
violation
of
a
simple
geometrical
law
that
parallel
lines
should
never
meet
even
if
produced
ever
so
far
both
ways
but
it
meant
the
titanic
had
sunk
by
the
head
until
the
lowest
portholes
in
the
bows
were
under
the
sea
and
the
portholes
in
the
stern
were
lifted
above
the
normal
height
we
rowed
away
from
her
in
the
quietness
of
the
night
hoping
and
praying
with
all
our
hearts
that
she
would
sink
no
more
and
the
day
would
find
her
still
in
the
same
position
as
she
was
then
the
crew
however
did
not
think
so
it
has
been
said
frequently
that
the
officers
and
crew
felt
assured
that
she
would
remain
afloat
even
after
they
knew
the
extent
of
the
damage
some
of
them
may
have
done
so
and
perhaps
from
their
scientific
knowledge
of
her
construction
with
more
reason
at
the
time
than
those
who
said
she
would
sink
but
at
any
rate
the
stokers
in
our
boat
had
no
such
illusion
one
of
them
i
think
he
was
the
same
man
that
cut
us
free
from
the
pulley
ropes
told
us
how
he
was
at
work
in
the
and
in
anticipation
of
going
off
duty
in
quarter
of
an
hour
thus
confirming
the
time
of
the
collision
as
had
near
him
a
pan
of
soup
keeping
hot
on
some
part
of
the
machinery
suddenly
the
whole
side
of
the
compartment
came
in
and
the
water
rushed
him
off
his
feet
picking
himself
up
he
sprang
for
the
compartment
doorway
and
was
just
through
the
aperture
when
the
watertight
door
came
down
behind
him
like
a
knife
as
he
said
they
work
them
from
the
bridge
he
had
gone
up
on
deck
but
was
ordered
down
again
at
once
and
with
others
was
told
to
draw
the
fires
from
under
the
boiler
which
they
did
and
were
then
at
liberty
to
come
on
deck
again
it
seems
that
this
particular
knot
of
stokers
must
have
known
almost
as
soon
as
any
one
of
the
extent
of
injury
he
added
mournfully
i
could
do
with
that
hot
soup
now
and
indeed
he
could
he
was
clad
at
the
time
of
the
collision
he
said
in
trousers
and
singlet
both
very
thin
on
account
of
the
intense
heat
in
the
and
although
he
had
added
a
short
jacket
later
his
teeth
were
chattering
with
the
cold
he
found
a
place
to
lie
down
underneath
the
tiller
on
the
little
platform
where
our
captain
stood
and
there
he
lay
all
night
with
a
coat
belonging
to
another
stoker
thrown
over
him
and
i
think
he
must
have
been
almost
unconscious
a
lady
next
to
him
who
was
warmly
clad
with
several
coats
tried
to
insist
on
his
having
one
of
hers
a
one
thrown
over
him
but
he
absolutely
refused
while
some
of
the
women
were
insufficiently
clad
and
so
the
coat
was
given
to
an
irish
girl
with
pretty
auburn
hair
standing
near
leaning
against
the
gunwale
with
an
outside
berth
and
so
more
exposed
to
the
cold
air
this
same
lady
was
able
to
distribute
more
of
her
wraps
to
the
passengers
a
rug
to
one
a
fur
boa
to
another
and
she
has
related
with
amusement
that
at
the
moment
of
climbing
up
the
carpathia
side
those
to
whom
these
articles
had
been
lent
offered
them
all
back
to
her
but
as
like
the
rest
of
us
she
was
encumbered
with
a
lifebelt
she
had
to
say
she
would
receive
them
back
at
the
end
of
the
climb
i
had
not
seen
my
since
i
dropped
into
the
boat
but
some
time
in
the
night
a
steerage
passenger
found
it
on
the
floor
and
put
it
on
it
is
not
easy
at
this
time
to
call
to
mind
who
were
in
the
boat
because
in
the
night
it
was
not
possible
to
see
more
than
a
few
feet
away
and
when
dawn
came
we
had
eyes
only
for
the
rescue
ship
and
the
icebergs
but
so
far
as
my
memory
serves
the
list
was
as
follows
no
passengers
three
women
one
baby
two
men
from
the
second
cabin
and
the
other
passengers
steerage
mostly
women
a
total
of
about
passengers
the
rest
about
and
possibly
more
were
crew
and
stokers
near
to
me
all
night
was
a
group
of
three
swedish
girls
warmly
clad
standing
close
together
to
keep
warm
and
very
silent
indeed
there
was
very
little
talking
at
any
time
one
conversation
took
place
that
is
i
think
worth
repeating
one
more
proof
that
the
world
after
all
is
a
small
place
the
ten
old
baby
which
was
handed
down
at
the
last
moment
was
received
by
a
lady
next
to
me
the
same
who
shared
her
wraps
and
coats
the
mother
had
found
a
place
in
the
middle
and
was
too
tightly
packed
to
come
through
to
the
child
and
so
it
slept
contentedly
for
about
an
hour
in
a
stranger
arms
it
then
began
to
cry
and
the
temporary
nurse
said
will
you
feel
down
and
see
if
the
baby
feet
are
out
of
the
blanket
i
do
know
much
about
babies
but
i
think
their
feet
must
be
kept
warm
wriggling
down
as
well
as
i
could
i
found
its
toes
exposed
to
the
air
and
wrapped
them
well
up
when
it
ceased
crying
at
once
it
was
evidently
a
successful
diagnosis
having
recognized
the
lady
by
her
voice
it
was
much
too
dark
to
see
faces
as
one
of
my
at
the
purser
table
i
said
surely
you
are
miss
yes
she
replied
and
you
must
be
beesley
how
curious
we
should
find
ourselves
in
the
same
boat
remembering
that
she
had
joined
the
boat
at
queenstown
i
said
do
you
know
clonmel
a
letter
from
a
great
friend
of
mine
who
is
staying
there
at
giving
the
address
came
aboard
at
queenstown
yes
it
is
my
home
and
i
was
dining
at
just
before
i
came
away
it
seemed
that
she
knew
my
friend
too
and
we
agreed
that
of
all
places
in
the
world
to
recognize
mutual
friends
a
crowded
lifeboat
afloat
in
at
twelve
hundred
miles
from
our
destination
was
one
of
the
most
unexpected
and
all
the
time
as
we
watched
the
titanic
sank
lower
and
lower
by
the
head
and
the
angle
became
wider
and
wider
as
the
stern
porthole
lights
lifted
and
the
bow
lights
sank
and
it
was
evident
she
was
not
to
stay
afloat
much
longer
the
now
told
the
oarsmen
to
row
away
as
hard
as
they
could
two
reasons
seemed
to
make
this
a
wise
decision
one
that
as
she
sank
she
would
create
such
a
wave
of
suction
that
boats
if
not
sucked
under
by
being
too
near
would
be
in
danger
of
being
swamped
by
the
wave
her
sinking
would
create
and
we
all
knew
our
boat
was
in
no
condition
to
ride
big
waves
crowded
as
it
was
and
manned
with
untrained
oarsmen
the
second
was
that
an
explosion
might
result
from
the
water
getting
to
the
boilers
and
dèbris
might
fall
within
a
wide
radius
and
yet
as
it
turned
out
neither
of
these
things
happened
at
about
i
think
we
were
any
distance
from
a
mile
to
two
miles
away
it
is
difficult
for
a
landsman
to
calculate
distance
at
sea
but
we
had
been
afloat
an
hour
and
a
half
the
boat
was
heavily
loaded
the
oarsmen
unskilled
and
our
course
erratic
following
now
one
light
and
now
another
sometimes
a
star
and
sometimes
a
light
from
a
port
lifeboat
which
had
turned
away
from
the
titanic
in
the
opposite
direction
and
lay
almost
on
our
horizon
and
so
we
could
not
have
gone
very
far
away
about
this
time
the
water
had
crept
up
almost
to
her
sidelight
and
the
captain
bridge
and
it
seemed
a
question
only
of
minutes
before
she
sank
the
oarsmen
lay
on
their
oars
and
all
in
the
lifeboat
were
motionless
as
we
watched
her
in
absolute
silence
save
some
who
would
not
look
and
buried
their
heads
on
each
others
shoulders
the
lights
still
shone
with
the
same
brilliance
but
not
so
many
of
them
many
were
now
below
the
surface
i
have
often
wondered
since
whether
they
continued
to
light
up
the
cabins
when
the
portholes
were
under
water
they
may
have
done
so
and
then
as
we
gazed
she
tilted
slowly
up
revolving
apparently
about
a
centre
of
gravity
just
astern
of
amidships
until
she
attained
a
vertically
upright
position
and
there
she
remained
motionless
as
she
swung
up
her
lights
which
had
shone
without
a
flicker
all
night
went
out
suddenly
came
on
again
for
a
single
flash
then
went
out
altogether
and
as
they
did
so
there
came
a
noise
which
many
people
wrongly
i
think
have
described
as
an
explosion
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
nothing
but
the
engines
and
machinery
coming
loose
from
their
bolts
and
bearings
and
falling
through
the
compartments
smashing
everything
in
their
way
it
was
partly
a
roar
partly
a
groan
partly
a
rattle
and
partly
a
smash
and
it
was
not
a
sudden
roar
as
an
explosion
would
be
it
went
on
successively
for
some
seconds
possibly
fifteen
to
twenty
as
the
heavy
machinery
dropped
down
to
the
bottom
now
the
bows
of
the
ship
i
suppose
it
fell
through
the
end
and
sank
first
before
the
ship
but
it
was
a
noise
no
one
had
heard
before
and
no
one
wishes
to
hear
again
it
was
stupefying
stupendous
as
it
came
to
us
along
the
water
it
was
as
if
all
the
heavy
things
one
could
think
of
had
been
thrown
downstairs
from
the
top
of
a
house
smashing
each
other
and
the
stairs
and
everything
in
the
way
several
apparently
authentic
accounts
have
been
given
in
which
definite
stories
of
explosions
have
been
related
in
some
cases
even
with
wreckage
blown
up
and
the
ship
broken
in
two
but
i
think
such
accounts
will
not
stand
close
analysis
in
the
first
place
the
fires
had
been
withdrawn
and
the
steam
allowed
to
escape
some
time
before
she
sank
and
the
possibility
of
explosion
from
this
cause
seems
very
remote
then
as
just
related
the
noise
was
not
sudden
and
definite
but
prolonged
more
like
the
roll
and
crash
of
thunder
the
probability
of
the
noise
being
caused
by
engines
falling
down
will
be
seen
by
referring
to
figure
page
where
the
engines
are
placed
in
compartments
and
as
the
titanic
tilted
up
they
would
almost
certainly
fall
loose
from
their
bed
and
plunge
down
through
the
other
compartments
no
phenomenon
like
that
pictured
in
some
american
and
english
papers
occurred
that
of
the
ship
breaking
in
two
and
the
two
ends
being
raised
above
the
surface
i
saw
these
drawings
in
preparation
on
board
the
carpathia
and
said
at
the
time
that
they
bore
no
resemblance
to
what
actually
happened
when
the
noise
was
over
the
titanic
was
still
upright
like
a
column
we
could
see
her
now
only
as
the
stern
and
some
feet
of
her
stood
outlined
against
the
sky
looming
black
in
the
darkness
and
in
this
position
she
continued
for
some
minutes
i
think
as
much
as
five
minutes
but
it
may
have
been
less
then
first
sinking
back
a
little
at
the
stern
i
thought
she
slid
slowly
forwards
through
the
water
and
dived
slantingly
down
the
sea
closed
over
her
and
we
had
seen
the
last
of
the
beautiful
ship
on
which
we
had
embarked
four
days
before
at
southampton
and
in
place
of
the
ship
on
which
all
our
interest
had
been
concentrated
for
so
long
and
towards
which
we
looked
most
of
the
time
because
it
was
still
the
only
object
on
the
sea
which
was
a
fixed
point
to
us
in
place
of
the
titanic
we
had
the
level
sea
now
stretching
in
an
unbroken
expanse
to
the
horizon
heaving
gently
just
as
before
with
no
indication
on
the
surface
that
the
waves
had
just
closed
over
the
most
wonderful
vessel
ever
built
by
man
hand
the
stars
looked
down
just
the
same
and
the
air
was
just
as
bitterly
cold
there
seemed
a
great
sense
of
loneliness
when
we
were
left
on
the
sea
in
a
small
boat
without
the
titanic
not
that
we
were
uncomfortable
except
for
the
cold
nor
in
danger
we
did
not
think
we
were
either
but
the
titanic
was
no
longer
there
we
waited
head
on
for
the
wave
which
we
thought
might
come
the
wave
we
had
heard
so
much
of
from
the
crew
and
which
they
said
had
been
known
to
travel
for
miles
and
it
never
came
but
although
the
titanic
left
us
no
such
legacy
of
a
wave
as
she
went
to
the
bottom
she
left
us
something
we
would
willingly
forget
forever
something
which
it
is
well
not
to
let
the
imagination
dwell
on
the
cries
of
many
hundreds
of
our
struggling
in
the
water
i
would
willingly
omit
any
further
mention
of
this
part
of
the
disaster
from
this
book
but
for
two
reasons
it
is
not
possible
first
that
as
a
matter
of
history
it
should
be
put
on
record
and
secondly
that
these
cries
were
not
only
an
appeal
for
help
in
the
awful
conditions
of
danger
in
which
the
drowning
found
themselves
an
appeal
that
could
never
be
answered
but
an
appeal
to
the
whole
world
to
make
such
conditions
of
danger
and
hopelessness
impossible
ever
again
a
cry
that
called
to
the
heavens
for
the
very
injustice
of
its
own
existence
a
cry
that
clamoured
for
its
own
destruction
we
were
utterly
surprised
to
hear
this
cry
go
up
as
the
waves
closed
over
the
titanic
we
had
heard
no
sound
of
any
kind
from
her
since
we
left
her
side
and
as
mentioned
before
we
did
not
know
how
many
boats
she
had
or
how
many
rafts
the
crew
may
have
known
but
they
probably
did
not
and
if
they
did
they
never
told
the
passengers
we
should
not
have
been
surprised
to
know
all
were
safe
on
some
device
so
that
unprepared
as
we
were
for
such
a
thing
the
cries
of
the
drowning
floating
across
the
quiet
sea
filled
us
with
stupefaction
we
longed
to
return
and
rescue
at
least
some
of
the
drowning
but
we
knew
it
was
impossible
the
boat
was
filled
to
and
to
return
would
mean
the
swamping
of
us
all
and
so
the
told
his
crew
to
row
away
from
the
cries
we
tried
to
sing
to
keep
all
from
thinking
of
them
but
there
was
no
heart
for
singing
in
the
boat
at
that
time
the
cries
which
were
loud
and
numerous
at
first
died
away
gradually
one
by
one
but
the
night
was
clear
frosty
and
still
the
water
smooth
and
the
sounds
must
have
carried
on
its
level
surface
free
from
any
obstruction
for
miles
certainly
much
farther
from
the
ship
than
we
were
situated
i
think
the
last
of
them
must
have
been
heard
nearly
forty
minutes
after
the
titanic
sank
lifebelts
would
keep
the
survivors
afloat
for
hours
but
the
cold
water
was
what
stopped
the
cries
there
must
have
come
to
all
those
safe
in
the
lifeboats
scattered
round
the
drowning
at
various
distances
a
deep
resolve
that
if
anything
could
be
done
by
them
in
the
future
to
prevent
the
repetition
of
such
sounds
they
would
do
it
at
whatever
cost
of
time
or
other
things
and
not
only
to
them
are
those
cries
an
imperative
call
but
to
every
man
and
woman
who
has
known
of
them
it
is
not
possible
that
ever
again
can
such
conditions
exist
but
it
is
a
duty
imperative
on
one
and
all
to
see
that
they
do
not
think
of
it
a
few
more
boats
a
few
more
planks
of
wood
nailed
together
in
a
particular
way
at
a
trifling
cost
and
all
those
men
and
women
whom
the
world
can
so
ill
afford
to
lose
would
be
with
us
there
would
be
no
mourning
in
thousands
of
homes
which
now
are
desolate
and
these
words
need
not
have
been
written
chapter
v
the
rescue
all
accounts
agree
that
the
titanic
sunk
about
a
watch
in
our
boat
gave
the
time
as
shortly
afterwards
we
were
then
in
touch
with
three
other
boats
one
was
on
our
starboard
quarter
and
the
others
i
have
always
supposed
were
and
but
i
do
not
know
definitely
we
never
got
into
close
touch
with
each
other
but
called
occasionally
across
the
darkness
and
saw
them
looming
near
and
then
drawing
away
again
we
called
to
ask
if
any
officer
were
aboard
the
other
three
but
did
not
find
one
so
in
the
absence
of
any
plan
of
action
we
rowed
slowly
forward
or
what
we
thought
was
forward
for
it
was
in
the
direction
the
titanic
bows
were
pointing
before
she
sank
i
see
now
that
we
must
have
been
pointing
northwest
for
we
presently
saw
the
northern
lights
on
the
starboard
and
again
when
the
carpathia
came
up
from
the
south
we
saw
her
from
behind
us
on
the
southeast
and
turned
our
boat
around
to
get
to
her
i
imagine
the
boats
must
have
spread
themselves
over
the
ocean
fanwise
as
they
escaped
from
the
titanic
those
on
the
starboard
and
port
sides
forward
being
almost
dead
ahead
of
her
and
the
stern
boats
being
broadside
from
her
this
explains
why
the
port
boats
were
so
much
longer
in
reaching
the
carpathia
as
late
as
while
some
of
the
starboard
boats
came
up
as
early
as
some
of
the
port
boats
had
to
row
across
the
place
where
the
titanic
sank
to
get
to
the
carpathia
through
the
debris
of
chairs
and
wreckage
of
all
kinds
none
of
the
other
three
boats
near
us
had
a
light
and
we
missed
lights
badly
we
could
not
see
each
other
in
the
darkness
we
could
not
signal
to
ships
which
might
be
rushing
up
full
speed
from
any
quarter
to
the
titanic
rescue
and
now
we
had
been
through
so
much
it
would
seem
hard
to
have
to
encounter
the
additional
danger
of
being
in
the
line
of
a
rescuing
ship
we
felt
again
for
the
lantern
beneath
our
feet
along
the
sides
and
i
managed
this
time
to
get
down
to
the
locker
below
the
tiller
platform
and
open
it
in
front
by
removing
a
board
to
find
nothing
but
the
zinc
airtank
which
renders
the
boat
unsinkable
when
upset
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
light
in
the
boat
we
felt
also
for
food
and
water
and
found
none
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
none
had
been
put
in
but
here
we
were
mistaken
i
have
a
letter
from
second
officer
lightoller
in
which
he
assures
me
that
he
and
fourth
officer
pitman
examined
every
lifeboat
from
the
titanic
as
they
lay
on
the
carpathia
deck
afterwards
and
found
biscuits
and
water
in
each
not
that
we
wanted
any
food
or
water
then
we
thought
of
the
time
that
might
elapse
before
the
olympic
picked
us
up
in
the
afternoon
towards
we
saw
a
faint
glow
in
the
sky
ahead
on
the
starboard
quarter
the
first
gleams
we
thought
of
the
coming
dawn
we
were
not
certain
of
the
time
and
were
eager
perhaps
to
accept
too
readily
any
relief
from
darkness
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
look
each
other
in
the
face
and
see
who
were
our
companions
in
good
fortune
to
be
free
from
the
hazard
of
lying
in
a
steamer
track
invisible
in
the
darkness
but
we
were
doomed
to
disappointment
the
soft
light
increased
for
a
time
and
died
away
a
little
glowed
again
and
then
remained
stationary
for
some
minutes
the
northern
lights
it
suddenly
came
to
me
and
so
it
was
presently
the
light
arched
fanwise
across
the
northern
sky
with
faint
streamers
reaching
towards
the
i
had
seen
them
of
about
the
same
intensity
in
england
some
years
ago
and
knew
them
again
a
sigh
of
disappointment
went
through
the
boat
as
we
realized
that
the
day
was
not
yet
but
had
we
known
it
something
more
comforting
even
than
the
day
was
in
store
for
us
all
night
long
we
had
watched
the
horizon
with
eager
eyes
for
signs
of
a
steamer
lights
we
heard
from
the
that
the
first
appearance
would
be
a
single
light
on
the
horizon
the
masthead
light
followed
shortly
by
a
second
one
lower
down
on
the
deck
if
these
two
remained
in
vertical
alignment
and
the
distance
between
them
increased
as
the
lights
drew
nearer
we
might
be
certain
it
was
a
steamer
but
what
a
night
to
see
that
first
light
on
the
horizon
we
saw
it
many
times
as
the
earth
revolved
and
some
stars
rose
on
the
clear
horizon
and
others
sank
down
to
it
there
were
lights
on
every
quarter
some
we
watched
and
followed
until
we
saw
the
deception
and
grew
wiser
some
were
lights
from
those
of
our
boats
that
were
fortunate
enough
to
have
lanterns
but
these
were
generally
easily
detected
as
they
rose
and
fell
in
the
near
distance
once
they
raised
our
hopes
only
to
sink
them
to
zero
again
near
what
seemed
to
be
the
horizon
on
the
port
quarter
we
saw
two
lights
close
together
and
thought
this
must
be
our
double
light
but
as
we
gazed
across
the
miles
that
separated
us
the
lights
slowly
drew
apart
and
we
realized
that
they
were
two
boats
lanterns
at
different
distances
from
us
in
line
one
behind
the
other
they
were
probably
the
forward
port
boats
that
had
to
return
so
many
miles
next
morning
across
the
graveyard
but
notwithstanding
these
hopes
and
disappointments
the
absence
of
lights
food
and
water
as
we
thought
and
the
bitter
cold
it
would
not
be
correct
to
say
we
were
unhappy
in
those
early
morning
hours
the
cold
that
settled
down
on
us
like
a
garment
that
wraps
close
around
was
the
only
real
discomfort
and
that
we
could
keep
at
bay
by
not
thinking
too
much
about
it
as
well
as
by
vigorous
friction
and
gentle
stamping
on
the
floor
it
made
too
much
noise
to
stamp
hard
i
never
heard
that
any
one
in
boat
b
had
any
after
effects
from
the
cold
even
the
stoker
who
was
so
thinly
clad
came
through
without
harm
after
all
there
were
many
things
to
be
thankful
for
so
many
that
they
made
insignificant
the
temporary
inconvenience
of
the
cold
the
crowded
boat
the
darkness
and
the
hundred
and
one
things
that
in
the
ordinary
way
we
might
regard
as
unpleasant
the
quiet
sea
the
beautiful
night
how
different
from
two
nights
later
when
flashes
of
lightning
and
peals
of
thunder
broke
the
sleep
of
many
on
board
the
carpathia
and
above
all
the
fact
of
being
in
a
boat
at
all
when
so
many
of
our
and
crew
whose
cries
no
longer
moaned
across
the
water
to
us
were
silent
in
the
water
gratitude
was
the
dominant
note
in
our
feelings
then
but
grateful
as
we
were
our
gratitude
was
soon
to
be
increased
a
hundred
fold
about
as
nearly
as
i
can
judge
some
one
in
the
bow
called
our
attention
to
a
faint
gleam
in
the
southeast
we
all
turned
quickly
to
look
and
there
it
was
certainly
streaming
up
from
behind
the
horizon
like
a
distant
flash
of
a
warship
searchlight
then
a
faint
boom
like
guns
afar
off
and
the
light
died
away
again
the
stoker
who
had
lain
all
night
under
the
tiller
sat
up
suddenly
as
if
from
a
dream
the
overcoat
hanging
from
his
shoulders
i
can
see
him
now
staring
out
across
the
sea
to
where
the
sound
had
come
from
and
hear
him
shout
that
was
a
cannon
but
it
was
not
it
was
the
carpathia
rocket
though
we
did
not
know
it
until
later
but
we
did
know
now
that
something
was
not
far
away
racing
up
to
our
help
and
signalling
to
us
a
preliminary
message
to
cheer
our
hearts
until
she
arrived
with
every
sense
alert
eyes
gazing
intently
at
the
horizon
and
ears
open
for
the
least
sound
we
waited
in
absolute
silence
in
the
quiet
night
and
then
creeping
over
the
edge
of
the
sea
where
the
flash
had
been
we
saw
a
single
light
and
presently
a
second
below
it
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
well
above
the
horizon
and
they
remained
in
line
but
we
had
been
deceived
before
and
we
waited
a
little
longer
before
we
allowed
ourselves
to
say
we
were
safe
the
lights
came
up
rapidly
so
rapidly
it
seemed
only
a
few
minutes
though
it
must
have
been
longer
between
first
seeing
them
and
finding
them
well
above
the
horizon
and
bearing
down
rapidly
on
us
we
did
not
know
what
sort
of
a
vessel
was
coming
but
we
knew
she
was
coming
quickly
and
we
searched
for
paper
rags
anything
that
would
burn
we
were
quite
prepared
to
burn
our
coats
if
necessary
a
hasty
paper
torch
was
twisted
out
of
letters
found
in
some
one
pocket
lighted
and
held
aloft
by
the
stoker
standing
on
the
tiller
platform
the
little
light
shone
in
flickers
on
the
faces
of
the
occupants
of
the
boat
ran
in
broken
lines
for
a
few
yards
along
the
black
oily
sea
where
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
presence
of
that
awful
thing
which
had
caused
the
whole
terrible
disaster
ice
in
little
chunks
the
size
of
one
fist
bobbing
harmlessly
up
and
down
and
spluttered
away
to
blackness
again
as
the
stoker
threw
the
burning
remnants
of
paper
overboard
but
had
we
known
it
the
danger
of
being
run
down
was
already
over
one
reason
being
that
the
carpathia
had
already
seen
the
lifeboat
which
all
night
long
had
shown
a
green
light
the
first
indication
the
carpathia
had
of
our
position
but
the
real
reason
is
to
be
found
in
the
carpathia
log
went
full
speed
ahead
during
the
night
stopped
at
with
an
iceberg
dead
ahead
it
was
a
good
reason
with
our
torch
burnt
and
in
darkness
again
we
saw
the
headlights
stop
and
realized
that
the
rescuer
had
hove
to
a
sigh
of
relief
went
up
when
we
thought
no
hurried
scramble
had
to
be
made
to
get
out
of
her
way
with
a
chance
of
just
being
missed
by
her
and
having
to
meet
the
wash
of
her
screws
as
she
tore
by
us
we
waited
and
she
slowly
swung
round
and
revealed
herself
to
us
as
a
large
steamer
with
all
her
portholes
alight
i
think
the
way
those
lights
came
slowly
into
view
was
one
of
the
most
wonderful
things
we
shall
ever
see
it
meant
deliverance
at
once
that
was
the
amazing
thing
to
us
all
we
had
thought
of
the
afternoon
as
our
time
of
rescue
and
here
only
a
few
hours
after
the
titanic
sank
before
it
was
yet
light
we
were
to
be
taken
aboard
it
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
and
i
think
everyone
eyes
filled
with
tears
men
as
well
as
women
as
they
saw
again
the
rows
of
lights
one
above
the
other
shining
kindly
to
them
across
the
water
and
thank
god
was
murmured
in
heartfelt
tones
round
the
boat
the
boat
swung
round
and
the
crew
began
their
long
row
to
the
steamer
the
captain
called
for
a
song
and
led
off
with
pull
for
the
shore
boys
the
crew
took
it
up
quaveringly
and
the
passengers
joined
in
but
i
think
one
verse
was
all
they
sang
it
was
too
early
yet
gratitude
was
too
deep
and
sudden
in
its
overwhelming
intensity
for
us
to
sing
very
steadily
presently
finding
the
song
had
not
gone
very
well
we
tried
a
cheer
and
that
went
better
it
was
more
easy
to
relieve
our
feelings
with
a
noise
and
time
and
tune
were
not
necessary
ingredients
in
a
cheer
in
the
midst
of
our
thankfulness
for
deliverance
one
name
was
mentioned
with
the
deepest
feeling
of
gratitude
that
of
marconi
i
wish
that
he
had
been
there
to
hear
the
chorus
of
gratitude
that
went
out
to
him
for
the
wonderful
invention
that
spared
us
many
hours
and
perhaps
many
days
of
wandering
about
the
sea
in
hunger
and
storm
and
cold
perhaps
our
gratitude
was
sufficiently
intense
and
vivid
to
marconi
some
of
it
to
him
that
night
all
around
we
saw
boats
making
for
the
carpathia
and
heard
their
shouts
and
cheers
our
crew
rowed
hard
in
friendly
rivalry
with
other
boats
to
be
among
the
first
home
but
we
must
have
been
eighth
or
ninth
at
the
side
we
had
a
heavy
load
aboard
and
had
to
row
round
a
huge
iceberg
on
the
way
and
then
as
if
to
make
everything
complete
for
our
happiness
came
the
dawn
first
a
beautiful
quiet
shimmer
away
in
the
east
then
a
soft
golden
glow
that
crept
up
stealthily
from
behind
the
as
if
it
were
trying
not
to
be
noticed
as
it
stole
over
the
sea
and
spread
itself
quietly
in
every
direction
so
quietly
as
if
to
make
us
believe
it
had
been
there
all
the
time
and
we
had
not
observed
it
then
the
sky
turned
faintly
pink
and
in
the
distance
the
thinnest
fleeciest
clouds
stretched
in
thin
bands
across
the
horizon
and
close
down
to
it
becoming
every
moment
more
and
more
pink
and
next
the
stars
died
slowly
save
one
which
remained
long
after
the
others
just
above
the
horizon
and
near
by
with
the
crescent
turned
to
the
north
and
the
lower
horn
just
touching
the
horizon
the
thinnest
palest
of
moons
and
with
the
dawn
came
a
faint
breeze
from
the
west
the
first
breath
of
wind
we
had
felt
since
the
titanic
stopped
her
engines
anticipating
a
few
hours
as
the
day
drew
on
to
the
time
the
last
boats
came
up
this
breeze
increased
to
a
fresh
wind
which
whipped
up
the
sea
so
that
the
last
boat
laden
with
people
had
an
anxious
time
in
the
choppy
waves
before
they
reached
the
carpathia
an
officer
remarked
that
one
of
the
boats
could
not
have
stayed
afloat
another
hour
the
wind
had
held
off
just
long
enough
the
captain
shouted
along
our
boat
to
the
crew
as
they
strained
at
the
oars
two
pulling
and
an
extra
one
facing
them
and
pushing
to
try
to
keep
pace
with
the
other
boats
a
new
moon
turn
your
money
over
boys
that
is
if
you
have
any
we
laughed
at
him
for
the
quaint
superstition
at
such
a
time
and
it
was
good
to
laugh
again
but
he
showed
his
disbelief
in
another
superstition
when
he
added
well
i
shall
never
say
again
that
is
an
unlucky
number
boat
is
the
best
friend
we
ever
had
if
there
had
been
among
us
and
it
is
almost
certain
that
there
were
so
fast
does
superstition
cling
those
who
feared
events
connected
with
the
number
thirteen
i
am
certain
they
agreed
with
him
and
never
again
will
they
attach
any
importance
to
such
a
foolish
belief
perhaps
the
belief
itself
will
receive
a
shock
when
it
is
remembered
that
boat
of
the
titanic
brought
away
a
full
load
from
the
sinking
vessel
carried
them
in
such
comfort
all
night
that
they
had
not
even
a
drop
of
water
on
them
and
landed
them
safely
at
the
side
where
they
climbed
aboard
without
a
single
mishap
it
almost
tempts
one
to
be
the
thirteenth
at
table
or
to
choose
a
house
numbered
fearless
of
any
croaking
about
flying
in
the
face
of
what
is
humorously
called
providence
looking
towards
the
carpathia
in
the
faint
light
we
saw
what
seemed
to
be
two
large
fully
rigged
sailing
ships
near
the
horizon
with
all
sails
set
standing
up
near
her
and
we
decided
that
they
must
be
fishing
vessels
off
the
banks
of
newfoundland
which
had
seen
the
carpathia
stop
and
were
waiting
to
see
if
she
wanted
help
of
any
kind
but
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
light
shone
on
them
and
they
stood
revealed
as
huge
icebergs
peaked
in
a
way
that
readily
suggested
a
ship
when
the
sun
rose
higher
it
turned
them
pink
and
sinister
as
they
looked
towering
like
rugged
white
peaks
of
rock
out
of
the
sea
and
terrible
as
was
the
disaster
one
of
them
had
caused
there
was
an
awful
beauty
about
them
which
could
not
be
overlooked
later
when
the
sun
came
above
the
horizon
they
sparkled
and
glittered
in
its
rays
deadly
white
like
frozen
snow
rather
than
translucent
ice
as
the
dawn
crept
towards
us
there
lay
another
almost
directly
in
the
line
between
our
boat
and
the
carpathia
and
a
few
minutes
later
another
on
her
port
quarter
and
more
again
on
the
southern
and
western
horizons
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
all
differing
in
shape
and
size
and
tones
of
colour
according
as
the
sun
shone
through
them
or
was
reflected
directly
or
obliquely
from
them
illustration
the
carpathia
we
drew
near
our
rescuer
and
presently
could
discern
the
bands
on
her
funnel
by
which
the
crew
could
tell
she
was
a
cunarder
and
already
some
boats
were
at
her
side
and
passengers
climbing
up
her
ladders
we
had
to
give
the
iceberg
a
wide
berth
and
make
a
détour
to
the
south
we
knew
it
was
sunk
a
long
way
below
the
surface
with
such
things
as
projecting
ledges
not
that
it
was
very
likely
there
was
one
so
near
the
surface
as
to
endanger
our
small
boat
but
we
were
not
inclined
to
take
any
risks
for
the
sake
of
a
few
more
minutes
when
safety
lay
so
near
once
clear
of
the
berg
we
could
read
the
cunarder
name
c
a
r
p
a
t
h
i
a
a
name
we
are
not
likely
ever
to
forget
we
shall
see
her
sometimes
perhaps
in
the
shipping
lists
as
i
have
done
already
once
when
she
left
genoa
on
her
return
voyage
and
the
way
her
lights
climbed
up
over
the
horizon
in
the
darkness
the
way
she
swung
and
showed
her
lighted
portholes
and
the
moment
when
we
read
her
name
on
her
side
will
all
come
back
in
a
flash
we
shall
live
again
the
scene
of
rescue
and
feel
the
same
thrill
of
gratitude
for
all
she
brought
us
that
night
we
rowed
up
to
her
about
and
sheltering
on
the
port
side
from
the
swell
held
on
by
two
ropes
at
the
stern
and
bow
women
went
up
the
side
first
climbing
rope
ladders
with
a
noose
round
their
shoulders
to
help
their
ascent
men
passengers
scrambled
next
and
the
crew
last
of
all
the
baby
went
up
in
a
bag
with
the
opening
tied
up
it
had
been
quite
well
all
the
time
and
never
suffered
any
ill
effects
from
its
cold
journey
in
the
night
we
set
foot
on
deck
with
very
thankful
hearts
grateful
beyond
the
possibility
of
adequate
expression
to
feel
a
solid
ship
beneath
us
once
more
chapter
vi
the
sinking
of
the
titanic
seen
from
her
deck
the
two
preceding
chapters
have
been
to
a
large
extent
the
narrative
of
a
single
eyewitness
and
an
account
of
the
escape
of
one
boat
only
from
the
titanic
side
it
will
be
well
now
to
return
to
the
titanic
and
reconstruct
a
more
general
and
complete
account
from
the
experiences
of
many
people
in
different
parts
of
the
ship
a
considerable
part
of
these
experiences
was
related
to
the
writer
first
hand
by
survivors
both
on
board
the
carpathia
and
at
other
times
but
some
are
derived
from
other
sources
which
are
probably
as
accurate
as
information
other
reports
which
seemed
at
first
sight
to
have
been
founded
on
the
testimony
of
eyewitnesses
have
been
found
on
examination
to
have
passed
through
several
hands
and
have
therefore
been
rejected
the
testimony
even
of
has
in
some
cases
been
excluded
when
it
seemed
not
to
agree
with
direct
evidence
of
a
number
of
other
witnesses
or
with
what
reasoned
judgment
considered
probable
in
the
circumstances
in
this
category
are
the
reports
of
explosions
before
the
titanic
sank
the
breaking
of
the
ship
in
two
parts
the
suicide
of
officers
it
would
be
well
to
notice
here
that
the
titanic
was
in
her
correct
course
the
southerly
one
and
in
the
position
which
prudence
dictates
as
a
safe
one
under
the
ordinary
conditions
at
that
time
of
the
year
to
be
strictly
accurate
she
was
sixteen
miles
south
of
the
regular
summer
route
which
all
companies
follow
from
january
to
august
perhaps
the
real
history
of
the
disaster
should
commence
with
the
afternoon
of
sunday
when
marconigrams
were
received
by
the
titanic
from
the
ships
ahead
of
her
warning
her
of
the
existence
of
icebergs
in
connection
with
this
must
be
taken
the
marked
fall
of
temperature
observed
by
everyone
in
the
afternoon
and
evening
of
this
day
as
well
as
the
very
low
temperature
of
the
water
these
have
generally
been
taken
to
indicate
that
without
any
possibility
of
doubt
we
were
near
an
iceberg
region
and
the
severest
condemnation
has
been
poured
on
the
heads
of
the
officers
and
captain
for
not
having
regard
to
these
climatic
conditions
but
here
caution
is
necessary
there
can
be
little
doubt
now
that
the
low
temperature
observed
can
be
traced
to
the
icebergs
and
subsequently
encountered
but
experienced
sailors
are
aware
that
it
might
have
been
observed
without
any
icebergs
being
near
the
cold
labrador
current
sweeps
down
by
newfoundland
across
the
track
of
atlantic
liners
but
does
not
necessarily
carry
icebergs
with
it
cold
winds
blow
from
greenland
and
labrador
and
not
always
from
icebergs
and
so
that
falls
in
temperature
of
sea
and
air
are
not
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
close
proximity
of
icebergs
on
the
other
hand
a
single
iceberg
separated
by
many
miles
from
its
fellows
might
sink
a
ship
but
certainly
would
not
cause
a
drop
in
temperature
either
of
the
air
or
water
then
as
the
labrador
current
meets
the
warm
gulf
stream
flowing
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
across
to
europe
they
do
not
necessarily
intermingle
nor
do
they
always
run
side
by
side
or
one
on
top
of
the
other
but
often
interlaced
like
the
fingers
of
two
hands
as
a
ship
sails
across
this
region
the
thermometer
will
record
within
a
few
miles
temperatures
of
and
so
on
it
is
little
wonder
then
that
sailors
become
accustomed
to
place
little
reliance
on
temperature
conditions
as
a
means
of
estimating
the
probabilities
of
encountering
ice
in
their
track
an
experienced
sailor
has
told
me
that
nothing
is
more
difficult
to
diagnose
than
the
presence
of
icebergs
and
a
strong
confirmation
of
this
is
found
in
the
official
sailing
directions
issued
by
the
hydrographic
department
of
the
british
admiralty
no
reliance
can
be
placed
on
any
warning
being
conveyed
to
the
mariner
by
a
fall
in
temperature
either
of
sea
or
air
of
approaching
ice
some
decrease
in
temperature
has
occasionally
been
recorded
but
more
often
none
has
been
observed
but
notification
by
marconigram
of
the
exact
location
of
icebergs
is
a
vastly
different
matter
i
remember
with
deep
feeling
the
effect
this
information
had
on
us
when
it
first
became
generally
known
on
board
the
carpathia
rumours
of
it
went
round
on
wednesday
morning
grew
to
definite
statements
in
the
afternoon
and
were
confirmed
when
one
of
the
titanic
officers
admitted
the
truth
of
it
in
reply
to
a
direct
question
i
shall
never
forget
the
overwhelming
sense
of
hopelessness
that
came
over
some
of
us
as
we
obtained
definite
knowledge
of
the
warning
messages
it
was
not
then
the
unavoidable
accident
we
had
hitherto
supposed
the
sudden
plunging
into
a
region
crowded
with
icebergs
which
no
seaman
however
skilled
a
navigator
he
might
be
could
have
avoided
the
beautiful
titanic
wounded
too
deeply
to
recover
the
cries
of
the
drowning
still
ringing
in
our
ears
and
the
thousands
of
homes
that
mourned
all
these
calamities
none
of
all
these
things
need
ever
have
been
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
men
who
went
through
all
the
experiences
of
the
collision
and
the
rescue
and
the
subsequent
scenes
on
the
quay
at
new
york
with
hardly
a
tremor
were
quite
overcome
by
this
knowledge
and
turned
away
unable
to
speak
i
for
one
did
so
and
i
know
others
who
told
me
they
were
similarly
affected
i
think
we
all
came
to
modify
our
opinions
on
this
matter
however
when
we
learnt
more
of
the
general
conditions
attending
steamship
services
the
discussion
as
to
who
was
responsible
for
these
warnings
being
disregarded
had
perhaps
better
be
postponed
to
a
later
chapter
one
of
these
warnings
was
handed
to
ismay
by
captain
smith
at
and
returned
at
the
latter
request
at
that
it
might
be
posted
for
the
information
of
officers
as
a
result
of
the
messages
they
were
instructed
to
keep
a
special
lookout
for
ice
this
second
officer
lightoller
did
until
he
was
relieved
at
by
first
officer
murdock
to
whom
he
handed
on
the
instructions
during
lightoller
watch
about
the
captain
had
joined
him
on
the
bridge
and
discussed
the
time
we
should
be
getting
up
towards
the
vicinity
of
the
ice
and
how
we
should
recognize
it
if
we
should
see
it
and
refreshing
our
minds
on
the
indications
that
ice
gives
when
it
is
in
the
vicinity
apparently
too
the
officers
had
discussed
among
themselves
the
proximity
of
ice
and
lightoller
had
remarked
that
they
would
be
approaching
the
position
where
ice
had
been
reported
during
his
watch
the
lookouts
were
cautioned
similarly
but
no
ice
was
sighted
until
a
few
minutes
before
the
collision
when
the
lookout
man
saw
the
iceberg
and
rang
the
bell
three
times
the
usual
signal
from
the
crow
nest
when
anything
is
seen
by
telephone
he
reported
to
the
bridge
the
presence
of
an
iceberg
but
murdock
had
already
ordered
quartermaster
hichens
at
the
wheel
to
starboard
the
helm
and
the
vessel
began
to
swing
away
from
the
berg
but
it
was
far
too
late
at
the
speed
she
was
going
to
hope
to
steer
the
huge
titanic
over
a
sixth
of
a
mile
long
out
of
reach
of
danger
even
if
the
iceberg
had
been
visible
half
a
mile
away
it
is
doubtful
whether
some
portion
of
her
tremendous
length
would
not
have
been
touched
and
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
that
the
lookout
could
have
seen
the
berg
half
a
mile
away
in
the
conditions
that
existed
that
night
even
with
glasses
the
very
smoothness
of
the
water
made
the
presence
of
ice
a
more
difficult
matter
to
detect
in
ordinary
conditions
the
dash
of
the
waves
against
the
foot
of
an
iceberg
surrounds
it
with
a
circle
of
white
foam
visible
for
some
distance
long
before
the
iceberg
itself
but
here
was
an
oily
sea
sweeping
smoothly
round
the
deadly
monster
and
causing
no
indication
of
its
presence
there
is
little
doubt
moreover
that
the
crow
nest
is
not
a
good
place
from
which
to
detect
icebergs
it
is
proverbial
that
they
adopt
to
a
large
extent
the
colour
of
their
surroundings
and
seen
from
above
at
a
high
angle
with
the
black
sea
behind
the
iceberg
must
have
been
almost
invisible
until
the
titanic
was
close
upon
it
i
was
much
struck
by
a
remark
of
sir
ernest
shackleton
on
his
method
of
detecting
icebergs
to
place
a
lookout
man
as
low
down
near
the
as
he
could
get
him
remembering
how
we
had
watched
the
titanic
with
all
her
lights
out
standing
upright
like
an
enormous
black
finger
as
one
observer
stated
and
had
only
seen
her
thus
because
she
loomed
black
against
the
sky
behind
her
i
saw
at
once
how
much
better
the
sky
was
than
the
black
sea
to
show
up
an
bulk
and
so
in
a
few
moments
the
titanic
had
run
obliquely
on
the
berg
and
with
a
shock
that
was
astonishingly
slight
so
slight
that
many
passengers
never
noticed
it
the
submerged
portion
of
the
berg
had
cut
her
open
on
the
starboard
side
in
the
most
vulnerable
portion
of
her
anatomy
the
bilge
footnote
see
figure
page
the
most
authentic
accounts
say
that
the
wound
began
at
about
the
location
of
the
foremast
and
extended
far
back
to
the
stern
the
brunt
of
the
blow
being
taken
by
the
forward
plates
which
were
either
punctured
through
both
bottoms
directly
by
the
blow
or
through
one
skin
only
and
as
this
was
torn
away
it
ripped
out
some
of
the
inner
plates
the
fact
that
she
went
down
by
the
head
shows
that
probably
only
the
forward
plates
were
doubly
punctured
the
stern
ones
being
cut
open
through
the
outer
skin
only
after
the
collision
murdock
had
at
once
reversed
the
engines
and
brought
the
ship
to
a
standstill
but
the
iceberg
had
floated
away
astern
the
shock
though
little
felt
by
the
enormous
mass
of
the
ship
was
sufficient
to
dislodge
a
large
quantity
of
ice
from
the
berg
the
forecastle
deck
was
found
to
be
covered
with
pieces
of
ice
feeling
the
shock
captain
smith
rushed
out
of
his
cabin
to
the
bridge
and
in
reply
to
his
anxious
enquiry
was
told
by
murdock
that
ice
had
been
struck
and
the
emergency
doors
instantly
closed
the
officers
roused
by
the
collision
went
on
deck
some
to
the
bridge
others
while
hearing
nothing
of
the
extent
of
the
damage
saw
no
necessity
for
doing
so
captain
smith
at
once
sent
the
carpenter
below
to
sound
the
ship
and
fourth
officer
boxhall
to
the
steerage
to
report
damage
the
latter
found
there
a
very
dangerous
condition
of
things
and
reported
to
captain
smith
who
then
sent
him
to
the
and
here
again
it
was
easy
to
see
matters
looked
very
serious
were
floating
about
and
the
water
rising
rapidly
all
this
was
reported
to
the
captain
who
ordered
the
lifeboats
to
be
got
ready
at
once
boxhall
went
to
the
chartroom
to
work
out
the
ship
position
which
he
then
handed
to
the
marconi
operators
for
transmission
to
any
ship
near
enough
to
help
in
the
work
of
rescue
reports
of
the
damage
done
were
by
this
time
coming
to
the
captain
from
many
quarters
from
the
chief
engineer
from
the
designer
andrews
and
in
a
dramatic
way
from
the
sudden
appearance
on
deck
of
a
swarm
of
stokers
who
had
rushed
up
from
below
as
the
water
poured
into
the
and
they
were
immediately
ordered
down
below
to
duty
again
realizing
the
urgent
heed
of
help
he
went
personally
to
the
marconi
room
and
gave
orders
to
the
operators
to
get
into
touch
with
all
the
ships
they
could
and
to
tell
them
to
come
quickly
the
assistant
operator
bride
had
been
asleep
and
knew
of
the
damage
only
when
phillips
in
charge
of
the
marconi
room
told
him
ice
had
been
encountered
they
started
to
send
out
the
message
which
interpreted
means
all
stations
attend
and
d
distress
the
position
of
the
vessel
in
latitude
and
longitude
following
later
they
sent
out
an
arbitrary
message
agreed
upon
as
an
international
soon
after
the
vessel
struck
ismay
had
learnt
of
the
nature
of
the
accident
from
the
captain
and
chief
engineer
and
after
dressing
and
going
on
deck
had
spoken
to
some
of
the
officers
not
yet
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
grave
injury
done
to
the
vessel
by
this
time
all
those
in
any
way
connected
with
the
management
and
navigation
must
have
known
the
importance
of
making
use
of
all
the
ways
of
safety
known
to
them
and
that
without
any
delay
that
they
thought
at
first
that
the
titanic
would
sink
as
soon
as
she
did
is
doubtful
but
probably
as
the
reports
came
in
they
knew
that
her
ultimate
loss
in
a
few
hours
was
a
likely
contingency
on
the
other
hand
there
is
evidence
that
some
of
the
officers
in
charge
of
boats
quite
expected
the
embarkation
was
a
precautionary
measure
and
they
would
all
return
after
daylight
certainly
the
first
information
that
ice
had
been
struck
conveyed
to
those
in
charge
no
sense
of
the
gravity
of
the
circumstances
one
officer
even
retired
to
his
cabin
and
another
advised
a
steward
to
go
back
to
his
berth
as
there
was
no
danger
and
so
the
order
was
sent
round
all
passengers
on
deck
with
lifebelts
on
and
in
obedience
to
this
a
crowd
of
hastily
dressed
or
partially
dressed
people
began
to
assemble
on
the
decks
belonging
to
their
respective
classes
except
the
steerage
passengers
who
were
allowed
access
to
other
decks
tying
on
lifebelts
over
their
clothing
in
some
parts
of
the
ship
women
were
separated
from
the
men
and
assembled
together
near
the
boats
in
others
men
and
women
mingled
freely
together
husbands
helping
their
own
wives
and
families
and
then
other
women
and
children
into
the
boats
the
officers
spread
themselves
about
the
decks
superintending
the
work
of
lowering
and
loading
the
boats
and
in
three
cases
were
ordered
by
their
superior
officers
to
take
charge
of
them
at
this
stage
great
difficulty
was
experienced
in
getting
women
to
leave
the
ship
especially
where
the
order
was
so
rigorously
enforced
women
and
children
only
women
in
many
cases
refused
to
leave
their
husbands
and
were
actually
forcibly
lifted
up
and
dropped
in
the
boats
they
argued
with
the
officers
demanding
reasons
and
in
some
cases
even
when
induced
to
get
in
were
disposed
to
think
the
whole
thing
a
joke
or
a
precaution
which
it
seemed
to
them
rather
foolish
to
take
in
this
they
were
encouraged
by
the
men
left
behind
who
in
the
same
condition
of
ignorance
said
to
their
friends
as
they
went
down
adding
that
they
would
see
them
again
at
to
illustrate
further
how
little
danger
was
apprehended
when
it
was
discovered
on
the
deck
that
the
forward
lower
deck
was
covered
with
small
ice
snowballing
matches
were
arranged
for
the
following
morning
and
some
passengers
even
went
down
to
the
deck
and
brought
back
small
pieces
of
ice
which
were
handed
round
below
decks
too
was
additional
evidence
that
no
one
thought
of
immediate
danger
two
ladies
walking
along
one
of
the
corridors
came
across
a
group
of
people
gathered
round
a
door
which
they
were
trying
vainly
to
open
and
on
the
other
side
of
which
a
man
was
demanding
in
loud
terms
to
be
let
out
either
his
door
was
locked
and
the
key
not
to
be
found
or
the
collision
had
jammed
the
lock
and
prevented
the
key
from
turning
the
ladies
thought
he
must
be
afflicted
in
some
way
to
make
such
a
noise
but
one
of
the
men
was
assuring
him
that
in
no
circumstances
should
he
be
left
and
that
his
the
bystander
son
would
be
along
soon
and
would
smash
down
his
door
if
it
was
not
opened
in
the
mean
time
he
has
a
stronger
arm
than
i
have
he
added
the
son
arrived
presently
and
proceeded
to
make
short
work
of
the
door
it
was
smashed
in
and
the
inmate
released
to
his
great
satisfaction
and
with
many
expressions
of
gratitude
to
his
rescuer
but
one
of
the
head
stewards
who
came
up
at
this
juncture
was
so
incensed
at
the
damage
done
to
the
property
of
his
company
and
so
little
aware
of
the
infinitely
greater
damage
done
the
ship
that
he
warned
the
man
who
had
released
the
prisoner
that
he
would
be
arrested
on
arrival
in
new
york
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
no
general
warning
had
been
issued
to
passengers
here
and
there
were
experienced
travellers
to
whom
collision
with
an
iceberg
was
sufficient
to
cause
them
to
make
every
preparation
for
leaving
the
ship
but
the
great
majority
were
never
enlightened
as
to
the
amount
of
damage
done
or
even
as
to
what
had
happened
we
knew
in
a
vague
way
that
we
had
collided
with
an
iceberg
but
there
our
knowledge
ended
and
most
of
us
drew
no
deductions
from
that
fact
alone
another
factor
that
prevented
some
from
taking
to
the
boats
was
the
drop
to
the
water
below
and
the
journey
into
the
unknown
sea
certainly
it
looked
a
tremendous
way
down
in
the
darkness
the
sea
and
the
night
both
seemed
very
cold
and
lonely
and
here
was
the
ship
so
firm
and
well
lighted
and
warm
but
perhaps
what
made
so
many
people
declare
their
decision
to
remain
was
their
strong
belief
in
the
theory
of
the
titanic
unsinkable
construction
again
and
again
was
it
repeated
this
ship
can
not
sink
it
is
only
a
question
of
waiting
until
another
ship
comes
up
and
takes
us
off
husbands
expected
to
follow
their
wives
and
join
them
either
in
new
york
or
by
transfer
in
from
steamer
to
steamer
many
passengers
relate
that
they
were
told
by
officers
that
the
ship
was
a
lifeboat
and
could
not
go
down
one
lady
affirms
that
the
captain
told
her
the
titanic
could
not
sink
for
two
or
three
days
no
doubt
this
was
immediately
after
the
collision
it
is
not
any
wonder
then
that
many
elected
to
remain
deliberately
choosing
the
deck
of
the
titanic
to
a
place
in
a
lifeboat
and
yet
the
boats
had
to
go
down
and
so
at
first
they
went
this
is
the
real
explanation
of
why
they
were
not
as
fully
loaded
as
the
later
ones
it
is
important
then
to
consider
the
question
how
far
the
captain
was
justified
in
withholding
all
the
knowledge
he
had
from
every
passenger
from
one
point
of
view
he
should
have
said
to
them
this
ship
will
sink
in
a
few
hours
there
are
the
boats
and
only
women
and
children
can
go
to
them
but
had
he
the
authority
to
enforce
such
an
order
there
are
such
things
as
panics
and
rushes
which
get
beyond
the
control
of
a
handful
of
officers
even
if
armed
and
where
even
the
bravest
of
men
get
swept
off
their
feet
mentally
as
well
as
physically
on
the
other
hand
if
he
decided
to
withhold
all
definite
knowledge
of
danger
from
all
passengers
and
at
the
same
time
persuade
and
if
it
was
not
sufficient
compel
women
and
children
to
take
to
the
boats
it
might
result
in
their
all
being
saved
he
could
not
foresee
the
tenacity
of
their
faith
in
the
boat
there
is
ample
evidence
that
he
left
the
bridge
when
the
ship
had
come
to
rest
and
went
among
passengers
urging
them
to
get
into
the
boat
and
rigorously
excluding
all
but
women
and
children
some
would
not
go
officer
lowe
testified
that
he
shouted
who
next
for
the
boat
and
could
get
no
replies
the
boats
even
were
sent
away
although
the
fear
of
their
buckling
in
the
middle
was
responsible
as
well
for
this
but
the
captain
with
the
few
boats
at
his
disposal
could
hardly
do
more
than
persuade
and
advise
in
the
terrible
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
how
appalling
to
think
that
with
a
few
more
boats
and
the
ship
was
provided
with
that
particular
kind
of
davit
that
would
launch
more
boats
there
would
have
been
no
decision
of
that
kind
to
make
it
could
have
been
stated
plainly
this
ship
will
sink
in
a
few
hours
there
is
room
in
the
boats
for
all
passengers
beginning
with
women
and
children
poor
captain
smith
i
care
not
whether
the
responsibility
for
such
speed
in
iceberg
regions
will
rest
on
his
shoulders
or
not
no
man
ever
had
to
make
such
a
choice
as
he
had
that
night
and
it
seems
difficult
to
see
how
he
can
be
blamed
for
withholding
from
passengers
such
information
as
he
had
of
the
danger
that
was
imminent
when
one
reads
in
the
press
that
lifeboats
arrived
at
the
carpathia
half
full
it
seems
at
first
sight
a
dreadful
thing
that
this
should
have
been
allowed
to
happen
but
it
is
so
easy
to
make
these
criticisms
afterwards
so
easy
to
say
that
captain
smith
should
have
told
everyone
of
the
condition
of
the
vessel
he
was
faced
with
many
conditions
that
night
which
such
criticism
overlooks
let
any
person
consider
some
few
of
the
problems
presented
to
him
the
ship
was
bound
to
sink
in
a
few
hours
there
was
lifeboat
accommodation
for
all
women
and
children
and
some
men
there
was
no
way
of
getting
some
women
to
go
except
by
telling
them
the
ship
was
doomed
a
course
he
deemed
it
best
not
to
take
and
he
knew
the
danger
of
boats
buckling
when
loaded
full
his
solution
of
these
problems
was
apparently
the
following
to
send
the
boats
down
half
full
with
such
women
as
would
go
and
to
tell
the
boats
to
stand
by
to
pick
up
more
passengers
passed
down
from
the
cargo
ports
there
is
good
evidence
that
this
was
part
of
the
plan
i
heard
an
officer
give
the
order
to
four
boats
and
a
lady
in
number
boat
on
the
port
side
tells
me
the
sailors
were
so
long
looking
for
the
port
where
the
captain
personally
had
told
them
to
wait
that
they
were
in
danger
of
being
sucked
under
by
the
vessel
how
far
any
systematic
attempt
was
made
to
stand
by
the
ports
i
do
not
know
i
never
saw
one
open
or
any
boat
standing
near
on
the
starboard
side
but
then
boats
to
went
down
full
and
on
reaching
the
sea
rowed
away
at
once
there
is
good
evidence
then
that
captain
smith
fully
intended
to
load
the
boats
full
in
this
way
the
failure
to
carry
out
the
intention
is
one
of
the
things
the
whole
world
regrets
but
consider
again
the
great
size
of
the
ship
and
the
short
time
to
make
decisions
and
the
omission
is
more
easily
understood
the
fact
is
that
such
a
contingency
as
lowering
away
boats
was
not
even
considered
beforehand
and
there
is
much
cause
for
gratitude
that
as
many
as
seven
hundred
and
five
people
were
rescued
the
whole
question
of
a
captain
duties
seems
to
require
revision
it
was
totally
impossible
for
any
one
man
to
attempt
to
control
the
ship
that
night
and
the
weather
conditions
could
not
well
have
been
more
favourable
for
doing
so
one
of
the
reforms
that
seem
inevitable
is
that
one
man
shall
be
responsible
for
the
boats
their
manning
loading
and
lowering
leaving
the
captain
free
to
be
on
the
bridge
to
the
last
moment
but
to
return
for
a
time
to
the
means
taken
to
attract
the
notice
of
other
ships
the
wireless
operators
were
now
in
touch
with
several
ships
and
calling
to
them
to
come
quickly
for
the
water
was
pouring
in
and
the
titanic
beginning
to
go
down
by
the
head
bride
testified
that
the
first
reply
received
was
from
a
german
boat
the
frankfurt
which
was
all
right
stand
by
but
not
giving
her
position
from
comparison
of
the
strength
of
signals
received
from
the
frankfurt
and
from
other
boats
the
operators
estimated
the
frankfurt
was
the
nearest
but
subsequent
events
proved
that
this
was
not
so
she
was
in
fact
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
away
and
arrived
at
next
morning
when
the
carpathia
had
left
with
the
rescued
the
next
reply
was
from
the
carpathia
miles
away
on
the
outbound
route
to
the
mediterranean
and
it
was
a
prompt
and
welcome
one
coming
hard
followed
by
the
position
then
followed
the
olympic
and
with
her
they
talked
for
some
time
but
she
was
five
hundred
and
sixty
miles
away
on
the
southern
route
too
far
to
be
of
any
immediate
help
at
the
speed
of
knots
she
would
expect
to
be
up
about
next
day
and
this
was
about
the
time
that
those
in
boat
had
calculated
we
had
always
assumed
in
the
boat
that
the
stokers
who
gave
this
information
had
it
from
one
of
the
officers
before
they
left
but
in
the
absence
of
any
knowledge
of
the
much
nearer
ship
the
carpathia
it
is
more
probable
that
they
knew
in
a
general
way
where
the
sister
ship
the
olympic
should
be
and
had
made
a
rough
calculation
other
ships
in
touch
by
wireless
were
the
mount
temple
fifty
miles
the
birma
one
hundred
miles
the
parisian
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
the
virginian
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
and
the
baltic
three
hundred
miles
but
closer
than
any
of
these
closer
even
than
the
carpathia
were
two
ships
the
californian
less
than
twenty
miles
away
with
the
wireless
operator
off
duty
and
unable
to
catch
the
signal
which
was
now
making
the
air
for
many
miles
around
quiver
in
its
appeal
for
help
immediate
urgent
help
for
the
hundreds
of
people
who
stood
on
the
titanic
deck
the
second
vessel
was
a
small
steamer
some
few
miles
ahead
on
the
port
side
without
any
wireless
apparatus
her
name
and
destination
still
unknown
and
yet
the
evidence
for
her
presence
that
night
seems
too
strong
to
be
disregarded
boxhall
states
that
he
and
captain
smith
saw
her
quite
plainly
some
five
miles
away
and
could
distinguish
the
lights
and
a
red
port
light
they
at
once
hailed
her
with
rockets
and
morse
electric
signals
to
which
boxhall
saw
no
reply
but
captain
smith
and
stewards
affirmed
they
did
the
second
and
third
officers
saw
the
signals
sent
and
her
lights
the
latter
from
the
lifeboat
of
which
he
was
in
charge
seaman
hopkins
testified
that
he
was
told
by
the
captain
to
row
for
the
light
and
we
in
boat
certainly
saw
it
in
the
same
position
and
rowed
towards
it
for
some
time
but
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
made
to
attract
its
attention
it
drew
slowly
away
and
the
lights
sank
below
the
horizon
the
pity
of
it
so
near
and
so
many
people
waiting
for
the
shelter
its
decks
could
have
given
so
easily
it
seems
impossible
to
think
that
this
ship
ever
replied
to
the
signals
those
who
said
so
must
have
been
mistaken
the
united
state
senate
committee
in
its
report
does
not
hesitate
to
say
that
this
unknown
steamer
and
the
californian
are
identical
and
that
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
latter
to
come
to
the
help
of
the
titanic
is
culpable
negligence
there
is
undoubted
evidence
that
some
of
the
crew
on
the
californian
saw
our
rockets
but
it
seems
impossible
to
believe
that
the
captain
and
officers
knew
of
our
distress
and
deliberately
ignored
it
judgment
on
the
matter
had
better
be
suspended
until
further
information
is
forthcoming
an
engineer
who
has
served
in
the
service
tells
me
that
it
is
a
common
practice
for
small
boats
to
leave
the
fishing
smacks
to
which
they
belong
and
row
away
for
miles
sometimes
even
being
lost
and
wandering
about
among
icebergs
and
even
not
being
found
again
in
these
circumstances
rockets
are
part
of
a
fishing
smack
equipment
and
are
sent
up
to
indicate
to
the
small
boats
how
to
return
is
it
conceivable
that
the
californian
thought
our
rockets
were
such
signals
and
therefore
paid
no
attention
to
them
incidentally
this
engineer
did
not
hesitate
to
add
that
it
is
doubtful
if
a
big
liner
would
stop
to
help
a
small
sending
off
distress
signals
or
even
would
turn
about
to
help
one
which
she
herself
had
cut
down
as
it
lay
in
her
path
without
a
light
he
was
strong
in
his
affirmation
that
such
things
were
commonly
known
to
all
officers
in
the
service
with
regard
to
the
other
vessels
in
wireless
communication
the
mount
temple
was
the
only
one
near
enough
from
the
point
of
distance
to
have
arrived
in
time
to
be
of
help
but
between
her
and
the
titanic
lay
the
enormous
and
icebergs
were
near
her
in
addition
the
seven
ships
which
caught
the
message
started
at
once
to
her
help
but
were
all
stopped
on
the
way
except
the
birma
by
the
wireless
announcing
the
fate
of
the
titanic
and
the
people
aboard
her
the
message
must
have
affected
the
captains
of
these
ships
very
deeply
they
would
understand
far
better
than
the
travelling
public
what
it
meant
to
lose
such
a
beautiful
ship
on
her
first
voyage
the
only
thing
now
left
to
be
done
was
to
get
the
lifeboats
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
to
this
task
the
other
officers
were
in
the
meantime
devoting
all
their
endeavours
lightoller
sent
away
boat
after
boat
in
one
he
had
put
women
and
children
in
another
thirty
in
another
and
then
running
short
of
seamen
to
man
the
boats
he
sent
major
peuchen
an
expert
yachtsman
in
the
next
to
help
with
its
navigation
by
the
time
these
had
been
filled
he
had
difficulty
in
finding
women
for
the
fifth
and
sixth
boats
for
the
reasons
already
stated
all
this
time
the
passengers
remained
to
use
his
own
expression
as
quiet
as
if
in
church
to
man
and
supervise
the
loading
of
six
boats
must
have
taken
him
nearly
up
to
the
time
of
the
titanic
sinking
taking
an
average
of
some
twenty
minutes
to
a
boat
still
at
work
to
the
end
he
remained
on
the
ship
till
she
sank
and
went
down
with
her
his
evidence
before
the
united
states
committee
was
as
follows
did
you
leave
the
ship
no
sir
did
the
ship
leave
you
yes
sir
it
was
a
piece
of
work
well
and
cleanly
done
and
his
escape
from
the
ship
one
of
the
most
wonderful
of
all
seems
almost
a
reward
for
his
devotion
to
duty
captain
smith
officers
wilde
and
murdock
were
similarly
engaged
in
other
parts
of
the
ship
urging
women
to
get
in
the
boats
in
some
cases
directing
junior
officers
to
go
down
in
some
of
them
officers
pitman
boxhall
and
lowe
were
sent
in
this
way
in
others
placing
members
of
the
crew
in
charge
as
the
boats
were
lowered
orders
were
shouted
to
them
where
to
make
for
some
were
told
to
stand
by
and
wait
for
further
instructions
others
to
row
for
the
light
of
the
disappearing
steamer
it
is
a
pitiful
thing
to
recall
the
effects
of
sending
down
the
first
boats
half
full
in
some
cases
men
in
the
company
of
their
wives
had
actually
taken
seats
in
the
boats
young
men
married
only
a
few
weeks
and
on
their
wedding
trip
and
had
done
so
only
because
no
more
women
could
then
be
found
but
the
strict
interpretation
by
the
particular
officer
in
charge
there
of
the
rule
of
women
and
children
only
compelled
them
to
get
out
again
some
of
these
boats
were
lowered
and
reached
the
carpathia
with
many
vacant
seats
the
anguish
of
the
young
wives
in
such
circumstances
can
only
be
imagined
in
other
parts
of
the
ship
however
a
different
interpretation
was
placed
on
the
rule
and
men
were
allowed
and
even
invited
by
officers
to
get
in
not
only
to
form
part
of
the
crew
but
even
as
passengers
this
of
course
in
the
first
boats
and
when
no
more
women
could
be
found
the
varied
understanding
of
this
rule
was
a
frequent
subject
of
discussion
on
the
carpathia
in
fact
the
rule
itself
was
debated
with
much
there
were
not
wanting
many
who
doubted
the
justice
of
its
rigid
enforcement
who
could
not
think
it
well
that
a
husband
should
be
separated
from
his
wife
and
family
leaving
them
penniless
or
a
young
bridegroom
from
his
wife
of
a
few
short
weeks
while
ladies
with
few
relatives
with
no
one
dependent
upon
them
and
few
responsibilities
of
any
kind
were
saved
it
was
mostly
these
ladies
who
pressed
this
view
and
even
men
seemed
to
think
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
it
perhaps
there
is
theoretically
but
it
would
be
impossible
i
think
in
practice
to
quote
lightoller
again
in
his
evidence
before
the
united
states
senate
committee
when
asked
if
it
was
a
rule
of
the
sea
that
women
and
children
be
saved
first
he
replied
no
it
is
a
rule
of
human
nature
that
is
no
doubt
the
real
reason
for
its
existence
but
the
selective
process
of
circumstances
brought
about
results
that
were
very
bitter
to
some
it
was
heartrending
for
ladies
who
had
lost
all
they
held
dearest
in
the
world
to
hear
that
in
one
boat
was
a
stoker
picked
up
out
of
the
sea
so
drunk
that
he
stood
up
and
brandished
his
arms
about
and
had
to
be
thrown
down
by
ladies
and
sat
upon
to
keep
him
quiet
if
comparisons
can
be
drawn
it
did
seem
better
that
an
educated
refined
man
should
be
saved
than
one
who
had
flown
to
drink
as
his
refuge
in
time
of
danger
these
discussions
turned
sometimes
to
the
old
enquiry
what
is
the
purpose
of
all
this
why
the
disaster
why
this
man
saved
and
that
man
lost
who
has
arranged
that
my
husband
should
live
a
few
short
happy
years
in
the
world
and
the
happiest
days
in
those
years
with
me
these
last
few
weeks
and
then
be
taken
from
me
i
heard
no
one
attribute
all
this
to
a
divine
power
who
ordains
and
arranges
the
lives
of
men
and
as
part
of
a
definite
scheme
sends
such
calamity
and
misery
in
order
to
purify
to
teach
to
spiritualize
i
do
not
say
there
were
not
people
who
thought
and
said
they
saw
divine
wisdom
in
it
all
so
inscrutable
that
we
in
our
ignorance
saw
it
not
but
i
did
not
hear
it
expressed
and
this
book
is
intended
to
be
no
more
than
a
partial
chronicle
of
the
many
different
experiences
and
convictions
there
were
those
on
the
other
hand
who
did
not
fail
to
say
emphatically
that
indifference
to
the
rights
and
feelings
of
others
blindness
to
duty
towards
our
fellow
men
and
women
was
in
the
last
analysis
the
cause
of
most
of
the
human
misery
in
the
world
and
it
should
undoubtedly
appeal
more
to
our
sense
of
justice
to
attribute
these
things
to
our
own
lack
of
consideration
for
others
than
to
shift
the
responsibility
on
to
a
power
whom
we
first
postulate
as
being
and
all
the
boats
were
lowered
and
sent
away
by
about
and
by
this
time
the
ship
was
very
low
in
the
water
the
forecastle
deck
completely
submerged
and
the
sea
creeping
steadily
up
to
the
bridge
and
probably
only
a
few
yards
away
no
one
on
the
ship
can
have
had
any
doubt
now
as
to
her
ultimate
fate
and
yet
the
fifteen
hundred
passengers
and
crew
on
board
made
no
demonstration
and
not
a
sound
came
from
them
as
they
stood
quietly
on
the
decks
or
went
about
their
duties
below
it
seems
incredible
and
yet
if
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
same
feeling
that
existed
on
deck
before
the
boats
left
and
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
the
explanation
is
straightforward
and
reasonable
in
its
simplicity
an
attempt
is
made
in
the
last
chapter
to
show
why
the
attitude
of
the
crowd
was
so
quietly
courageous
there
are
accounts
which
picture
excited
crowds
running
about
the
deck
in
terror
fighting
and
struggling
but
two
of
the
most
accurate
observers
colonel
gracie
and
lightoller
affirm
that
this
was
not
so
that
absolute
order
and
quietness
prevailed
the
band
still
played
to
cheer
the
hearts
of
all
near
the
engineers
and
their
crew
i
have
never
heard
any
one
speak
of
a
single
engineer
being
seen
on
deck
still
worked
at
the
electric
light
engines
far
away
below
keeping
them
going
until
no
human
being
could
do
so
a
second
longer
right
until
the
ship
tilted
on
end
and
the
engines
broke
loose
and
fell
down
the
light
failed
then
only
because
the
engines
were
no
longer
there
to
produce
light
not
because
the
men
who
worked
them
were
not
standing
by
them
to
do
their
duty
to
be
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
ship
far
away
from
the
deck
where
at
any
rate
there
was
a
chance
of
a
dive
and
a
swim
and
a
possible
rescue
to
know
that
when
the
ship
went
as
they
knew
it
must
soon
there
could
be
no
possible
hope
of
climbing
up
in
time
to
reach
the
sea
to
know
all
these
things
and
yet
to
keep
the
engines
going
that
the
decks
might
be
lighted
to
the
last
moment
required
sublime
courage
but
this
courage
is
required
of
every
engineer
and
it
is
not
called
by
that
name
it
is
called
duty
to
stand
by
his
engines
to
the
last
possible
moment
is
his
duty
there
could
be
no
better
example
of
the
supremest
courage
being
but
duty
well
done
than
to
remember
the
engineers
of
the
titanic
still
at
work
as
she
heeled
over
and
flung
them
with
their
engines
down
the
length
of
the
ship
the
simple
statement
that
the
lights
kept
on
to
the
last
is
really
their
epitaph
but
lowell
words
would
seem
to
apply
to
them
with
peculiar
force
the
longer
on
this
earth
we
live
and
weigh
the
various
qualities
of
men
the
more
we
feel
the
high
beauty
of
plain
devotedness
to
duty
steadfast
and
still
nor
paid
with
mortal
praise
but
finding
amplest
recompense
for
life
ungarlanded
expense
in
work
done
squarely
and
unwasted
days
for
some
time
before
she
sank
the
titanic
had
a
considerable
list
to
port
so
much
so
that
one
boat
at
any
rate
swung
so
far
away
from
the
side
that
difficulty
was
experienced
in
getting
passengers
in
this
list
was
increased
towards
the
end
and
colonel
gracie
relates
that
lightoller
who
has
a
deep
powerful
voice
ordered
all
passengers
to
the
starboard
side
this
was
close
before
the
end
they
crossed
over
and
as
they
did
so
a
crowd
of
steerage
passengers
rushed
up
and
filled
the
decks
so
full
that
there
was
barely
room
to
move
soon
afterwards
the
great
vessel
swung
slowly
stern
in
the
air
the
lights
went
out
and
while
some
were
flung
into
the
water
and
others
dived
off
the
great
majority
still
clung
to
the
rails
to
the
sides
and
roofs
of
lying
prone
on
the
deck
and
in
this
position
they
were
when
a
few
minutes
later
the
enormous
vessel
dived
obliquely
downwards
as
she
went
no
doubt
many
still
clung
to
the
rails
but
most
would
do
their
best
to
get
away
from
her
and
jump
as
she
slid
forwards
and
downwards
whatever
they
did
there
can
be
little
question
that
most
of
them
would
be
taken
down
by
suction
to
come
up
again
a
few
moments
later
and
to
fill
the
air
with
those
heartrending
cries
which
fell
on
the
ears
of
those
in
the
lifeboats
with
such
amazement
another
survivor
on
the
other
hand
relates
that
he
had
dived
from
the
stern
before
she
heeled
over
and
swam
round
under
her
enormous
triple
screws
lifted
by
now
high
out
of
the
water
as
she
stood
on
end
fascinated
by
the
extraordinary
sight
he
watched
them
up
above
his
head
but
presently
realizing
the
necessity
of
getting
away
as
quickly
as
possible
he
started
to
swim
from
the
ship
but
as
he
did
she
dived
forward
the
screws
passing
near
his
head
his
experience
is
that
not
only
was
no
suction
present
but
even
a
wave
was
created
which
washed
him
away
from
the
place
where
she
had
gone
down
of
all
those
fifteen
hundred
people
flung
into
the
sea
as
the
titanic
went
down
innocent
victims
of
thoughtlessness
and
apathy
of
those
responsible
for
their
safety
only
a
very
few
found
their
way
to
the
carpathia
it
will
serve
no
good
purpose
to
dwell
any
longer
on
the
scene
of
helpless
men
and
women
struggling
in
the
water
the
heart
of
everyone
who
has
read
of
their
helplessness
has
gone
out
to
them
in
deepest
love
and
sympathy
and
the
knowledge
that
their
struggle
in
the
water
was
in
most
cases
short
and
not
physically
painful
because
of
the
low
temperature
the
evidence
seems
to
show
that
few
lost
their
lives
by
drowning
is
some
consolation
if
everyone
sees
to
it
that
his
sympathy
with
them
is
so
practical
as
to
force
him
to
follow
up
the
question
of
reforms
personally
not
leaving
it
to
experts
alone
then
he
will
have
at
any
rate
done
something
to
atone
for
the
loss
of
so
many
valuable
lives
we
had
now
better
follow
the
adventures
of
those
who
were
rescued
from
the
final
event
in
the
disaster
two
accounts
those
of
colonel
gracie
and
lightoller
agree
very
closely
the
former
went
down
clinging
to
a
rail
the
latter
dived
before
the
ship
went
right
under
but
was
sucked
down
and
held
against
one
of
the
blowers
they
were
both
carried
down
for
what
seemed
a
long
distance
but
lightoller
was
finally
blown
up
again
by
a
terrific
gust
that
came
up
the
blower
and
forced
him
clear
colonel
gracie
came
to
the
surface
after
holding
his
breath
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
and
they
both
swam
about
holding
on
to
any
wreckage
they
could
find
finally
they
saw
an
upturned
collapsible
boat
and
climbed
on
it
in
company
with
twenty
other
men
among
them
bride
the
marconi
operator
after
remaining
thus
for
some
hours
with
the
sea
washing
them
to
the
waist
they
stood
up
as
day
broke
in
two
rows
back
to
back
balancing
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
and
afraid
to
turn
lest
the
boat
should
roll
over
finally
a
lifeboat
saw
them
and
took
them
off
an
operation
attended
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
they
reached
the
carpathia
in
the
early
dawn
not
many
people
have
gone
through
such
an
experience
as
those
men
did
lying
all
night
on
an
overturned
boat
and
praying
together
as
they
did
all
the
time
for
the
day
and
a
ship
to
take
them
off
some
account
must
now
be
attempted
of
the
journey
of
the
fleet
of
boats
to
the
carpathia
but
it
must
necessarily
be
very
brief
experiences
differed
considerably
some
had
no
encounters
at
all
with
icebergs
no
lack
of
men
to
row
discovered
lights
and
food
and
water
were
picked
up
after
only
a
few
hours
exposure
and
suffered
very
little
discomfort
others
seemed
to
see
icebergs
round
them
all
night
long
and
to
be
always
rowing
round
them
others
had
so
few
men
aboard
in
some
cases
only
two
or
three
that
ladies
had
to
row
and
in
one
case
to
steer
found
no
lights
food
or
water
and
were
adrift
many
hours
in
some
cases
nearly
eight
the
first
boat
to
be
picked
up
by
the
carpathia
was
one
in
charge
of
boxhall
there
was
only
one
other
man
rowing
and
ladies
worked
at
the
oars
a
green
light
burning
in
this
boat
all
night
was
the
greatest
comfort
to
the
rest
of
us
who
had
nothing
to
steer
by
although
it
meant
little
in
the
way
of
safety
in
itself
it
was
a
point
to
which
we
could
look
the
green
light
was
the
first
intimation
captain
rostron
had
of
our
position
and
he
steered
for
it
and
picked
up
its
passengers
first
pitman
was
sent
by
first
officer
murdock
in
charge
of
boat
with
forty
passengers
and
five
of
the
crew
it
would
have
held
more
but
no
women
could
be
found
at
the
time
it
was
lowered
pitman
says
that
after
leaving
the
ship
he
felt
confident
she
would
float
and
they
would
all
return
a
passenger
in
this
boat
relates
that
men
could
not
be
induced
to
embark
when
she
went
down
and
made
appointments
for
the
next
morning
with
him
tied
to
boat
was
boat
one
of
those
that
contained
few
people
a
few
were
transferred
from
number
but
it
would
have
held
many
more
fifth
officer
lowe
was
in
charge
of
boat
with
women
and
children
and
some
of
the
crew
so
full
was
the
boat
that
as
she
went
down
lowe
had
to
fire
his
revolver
along
the
ship
side
to
prevent
any
more
climbing
in
and
causing
her
to
buckle
this
boat
like
boat
was
difficult
to
release
from
the
lowering
tackle
and
had
to
be
cut
away
after
reaching
the
sea
lowe
took
in
charge
four
other
boats
tied
them
together
with
lines
found
some
of
them
not
full
and
transferred
all
his
passengers
to
these
distributing
them
in
the
darkness
as
well
as
he
could
then
returning
to
the
place
where
the
titanic
had
sunk
he
picked
up
some
of
those
swimming
in
the
water
and
went
back
to
the
four
boats
on
the
way
to
the
carpathia
he
encountered
one
of
the
collapsible
boats
and
took
aboard
all
those
in
her
as
she
seemed
to
be
sinking
boat
was
one
of
the
four
tied
together
and
the
seaman
in
charge
testified
that
he
tried
to
row
to
the
drowning
but
with
forty
women
and
children
and
only
one
other
man
to
row
it
was
not
possible
to
pull
such
a
heavy
boat
to
the
scene
of
the
wreck
boat
was
a
small
ship
boat
and
had
four
or
five
passengers
and
seven
of
the
crew
boat
was
one
of
the
last
to
leave
on
the
port
side
and
by
this
time
there
was
such
a
list
that
deck
chairs
had
to
bridge
the
gap
between
the
boat
and
the
deck
when
lowered
it
remained
for
some
time
still
attached
to
the
ropes
and
as
the
titanic
was
rapidly
sinking
it
seemed
she
would
be
pulled
under
the
boat
was
full
of
women
who
besought
the
sailors
to
leave
the
ship
but
in
obedience
to
orders
from
the
captain
to
stand
by
the
cargo
port
they
remained
near
so
near
in
fact
that
they
heard
china
falling
and
smashing
as
the
ship
went
down
by
the
head
and
were
nearly
hit
by
wreckage
thrown
overboard
by
some
of
the
officers
and
crew
and
intended
to
serve
as
rafts
they
got
clear
finally
and
were
only
a
short
distance
away
when
the
ship
sank
so
that
they
were
able
to
pull
some
men
aboard
as
they
came
to
the
surface
this
boat
had
an
unpleasant
experience
in
the
night
with
icebergs
many
were
seen
and
avoided
with
difficulty
quartermaster
hickens
was
in
charge
of
boat
and
in
the
absence
of
sailors
major
peuchen
was
sent
to
help
to
man
her
they
were
told
to
make
for
the
light
of
the
steamer
seen
on
the
port
side
and
followed
it
until
it
disappeared
there
were
forty
women
and
children
here
boat
had
only
one
seaman
and
as
captain
smith
had
enforced
the
rule
of
women
and
children
only
ladies
had
to
row
later
in
the
night
when
little
progress
had
been
made
the
seaman
took
an
oar
and
put
a
lady
in
charge
of
the
tiller
this
boat
again
was
in
the
midst
of
icebergs
of
the
four
collapsible
boats
although
collapsible
is
not
really
the
correct
term
for
only
a
small
portion
collapses
the
canvas
edge
surf
boats
is
really
their
name
one
was
launched
at
the
last
moment
by
being
pushed
over
as
the
sea
rose
to
the
edge
of
the
deck
and
was
never
righted
this
is
the
one
twenty
men
climbed
on
another
was
caught
up
by
lowe
and
the
passengers
transferred
with
the
exception
of
three
men
who
had
perished
from
the
effects
of
immersion
the
boat
was
allowed
to
drift
away
and
was
found
more
than
a
month
later
by
the
celtic
in
just
the
same
condition
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
long
this
boat
had
remained
afloat
after
she
was
supposed
to
be
no
longer
seaworthy
a
curious
coincidence
arose
from
the
fact
that
one
of
my
brothers
happened
to
be
travelling
on
the
celtic
and
looking
over
the
side
saw
adrift
on
the
sea
a
boat
belonging
to
the
titanic
in
which
i
had
been
wrecked
the
two
other
collapsible
boats
came
to
the
carpathia
carrying
full
loads
of
passengers
in
one
the
forward
starboard
boat
and
one
of
the
last
to
leave
was
ismay
here
four
chinamen
were
concealed
under
the
feet
of
the
passengers
how
they
got
there
no
one
knew
or
indeed
how
they
happened
to
be
on
the
titanic
for
by
the
immigration
laws
of
the
united
states
they
are
not
allowed
to
enter
her
ports
it
must
be
said
in
conclusion
that
there
is
the
greatest
cause
for
gratitude
that
all
the
boats
launched
carried
their
passengers
safely
to
the
rescue
ship
it
would
not
be
right
to
accept
this
fact
without
calling
attention
to
it
it
would
be
easy
to
enumerate
many
things
which
might
have
been
present
as
elements
of
danger
chapter
vii
the
carpathia
return
to
new
york
the
journey
of
the
carpathia
from
the
time
she
caught
the
from
the
titanic
at
about
on
monday
morning
and
turned
swiftly
about
to
her
rescue
until
she
arrived
at
new
york
on
the
following
thursday
at
was
one
that
demanded
of
the
captain
officers
and
crew
of
the
vessel
the
most
exact
knowledge
of
navigation
the
utmost
vigilance
in
every
department
both
before
and
after
the
rescue
and
a
capacity
for
organization
that
must
sometimes
have
been
taxed
to
the
breaking
point
the
extent
to
which
all
these
qualities
were
found
present
and
the
manner
in
which
they
were
exercised
stands
to
the
everlasting
credit
of
the
cunard
line
and
those
of
its
servants
who
were
in
charge
of
the
carpathia
captain
rostron
part
in
all
this
is
a
great
one
and
wrapped
up
though
his
action
is
in
a
modesty
that
is
conspicuous
in
its
nobility
it
stands
out
even
in
his
own
account
as
a
piece
of
work
well
and
courageously
done
as
soon
as
the
titanic
called
for
help
and
gave
her
position
the
carpathia
was
turned
and
headed
north
all
hands
were
called
on
duty
a
new
watch
of
stokers
was
put
on
and
the
highest
speed
of
which
she
was
capable
was
demanded
of
the
engineers
with
the
result
that
the
distance
of
miles
between
the
two
ships
was
covered
in
three
and
a
half
hours
a
speed
well
beyond
her
normal
capacity
the
three
doctors
on
board
each
took
charge
of
a
saloon
in
readiness
to
render
help
to
any
who
needed
their
services
the
stewards
and
catering
staff
were
hard
at
work
preparing
hot
drinks
and
meals
and
the
purser
staff
ready
with
blankets
and
berths
for
the
shipwrecked
passengers
as
soon
as
they
got
on
board
on
deck
the
sailors
got
ready
lifeboats
swung
them
out
on
the
davits
and
stood
by
prepared
to
lower
away
their
crews
if
necessary
fixed
nooses
and
bags
for
the
children
at
the
hatches
to
haul
the
rescued
up
the
side
on
the
bridge
was
the
captain
with
his
officers
peering
into
the
darkness
eagerly
to
catch
the
first
signs
of
the
crippled
titanic
hoping
in
spite
of
her
last
despairing
message
of
sinking
by
the
head
to
find
her
still
afloat
when
her
position
was
reached
a
double
watch
of
lookout
men
was
set
for
there
were
other
things
as
well
as
the
titanic
to
look
for
that
night
and
soon
they
found
them
as
captain
rostron
said
in
his
evidence
they
saw
icebergs
on
either
side
of
them
between
and
passing
twenty
large
ones
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
feet
high
and
many
smaller
ones
and
frequently
had
to
manoeuvre
the
ship
to
avoid
them
it
was
a
time
when
every
faculty
was
called
upon
for
the
highest
use
of
which
it
was
capable
with
the
knowledge
before
them
that
the
enormous
titanic
the
supposedly
unsinkable
ship
had
struck
ice
and
was
sinking
rapidly
with
the
lookout
constantly
calling
to
the
bridge
as
he
must
have
done
icebergs
on
the
starboard
icebergs
on
the
port
it
required
courage
and
judgment
beyond
the
ordinary
to
drive
the
ship
ahead
through
that
lane
of
icebergs
and
manoeuvre
round
them
as
he
himself
said
he
took
the
risk
of
full
speed
in
his
desire
to
save
life
and
probably
some
people
might
blame
him
for
taking
such
a
risk
but
the
senate
committee
assured
him
that
they
at
any
rate
would
not
and
we
of
the
lifeboats
have
certainly
no
desire
to
do
so
the
ship
was
finally
stopped
at
with
an
iceberg
reported
dead
ahead
the
same
no
doubt
we
had
to
row
around
in
boat
as
we
approached
the
carpathia
and
about
the
same
time
the
first
lifeboat
was
sighted
again
she
had
to
be
manoeuvred
round
the
iceberg
to
pick
up
the
boat
which
was
the
one
in
charge
of
boxhall
from
him
the
captain
learned
that
the
titanic
had
gone
down
and
that
he
was
too
late
to
save
any
one
but
those
in
lifeboats
which
he
could
now
see
drawing
up
from
every
part
of
the
horizon
meanwhile
the
passengers
of
the
carpathia
some
of
them
aroused
by
the
unusual
vibration
of
the
screw
some
by
sailors
tramping
overhead
as
they
swung
away
the
lifeboats
and
got
ropes
and
lowering
tackle
ready
were
beginning
to
come
on
deck
just
as
day
broke
and
here
an
extraordinary
sight
met
their
eyes
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
to
the
north
and
west
lay
an
unbroken
stretch
of
field
ice
with
icebergs
still
attached
to
the
floe
and
rearing
aloft
their
mass
as
a
hill
might
suddenly
rise
from
a
level
plain
ahead
and
to
the
south
and
east
huge
floating
monsters
were
showing
up
through
the
waning
darkness
their
number
added
to
moment
by
moment
as
the
dawn
broke
and
flushed
the
horizon
pink
it
is
remarkable
how
busy
all
those
icebergs
made
the
sea
look
to
have
gone
to
bed
with
nothing
but
sea
and
sky
and
to
come
on
deck
to
find
so
many
objects
in
sight
made
quite
a
change
in
the
character
of
the
sea
it
looked
quite
crowded
and
a
lifeboat
alongside
and
people
clambering
aboard
mostly
women
in
nightdresses
and
in
cloaks
and
shawls
in
anything
but
ordinary
clothes
out
ahead
and
on
all
sides
little
torches
glittered
faintly
for
a
few
moments
and
then
guttered
out
and
shouts
and
cheers
floated
across
the
quiet
sea
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
unexpected
sight
than
this
that
lay
before
the
carpathia
passengers
as
they
lined
the
sides
that
morning
in
the
early
dawn
no
novelist
would
dare
to
picture
such
an
array
of
beautiful
climatic
conditions
the
rosy
dawn
the
morning
star
the
moon
on
the
horizon
the
sea
stretching
in
level
beauty
to
the
and
on
this
sea
to
place
an
like
the
arctic
regions
and
icebergs
in
numbers
everywhere
white
and
turning
pink
and
deadly
cold
and
near
them
rowing
round
the
icebergs
to
avoid
them
little
boats
coming
suddenly
out
of
with
passengers
rescued
from
the
most
wonderful
ship
the
world
has
known
no
artist
would
have
conceived
such
a
picture
it
would
have
seemed
so
highly
dramatic
as
to
border
on
the
impossible
and
would
not
have
been
attempted
such
a
combination
of
events
would
pass
the
limit
permitted
the
imagination
of
both
author
and
artist
the
passengers
crowded
the
rails
and
looked
down
at
us
as
we
rowed
up
in
the
early
morning
stood
quietly
aside
while
the
crew
at
the
gangways
below
took
us
aboard
and
watched
us
as
if
the
ship
had
been
in
dock
and
we
had
rowed
up
to
join
her
in
a
somewhat
unusual
way
some
of
them
have
related
that
we
were
very
quiet
as
we
came
aboard
it
is
quite
true
we
were
but
so
were
they
there
was
very
little
excitement
on
either
side
just
the
quiet
demeanour
of
people
who
are
in
the
presence
of
something
too
big
as
yet
to
lie
within
their
mental
grasp
and
which
they
can
not
yet
discuss
and
so
they
asked
us
politely
to
have
hot
coffee
which
we
did
and
food
which
we
generally
declined
we
were
not
hungry
and
they
said
very
little
at
first
about
the
lost
titanic
and
our
adventures
in
the
night
much
that
is
exaggerated
and
false
has
been
written
about
the
mental
condition
of
passengers
as
they
came
aboard
we
have
been
described
as
being
too
dazed
to
understand
what
was
happening
as
being
too
overwhelmed
to
speak
and
as
looking
before
us
with
set
staring
gaze
dazed
with
the
shadow
of
the
dread
event
that
is
no
doubt
what
most
people
would
expect
in
the
circumstances
but
i
know
it
does
not
give
a
faithful
record
of
how
we
did
arrive
in
fact
it
is
simply
not
true
as
remarked
before
the
one
thing
that
matters
in
describing
an
event
of
this
kind
is
the
exact
truth
as
near
as
the
fallible
human
mind
can
state
it
and
my
own
impression
of
our
mental
condition
is
that
of
supreme
gratitude
and
relief
at
treading
the
firm
decks
of
a
ship
again
i
am
aware
that
experiences
differed
considerably
according
to
the
boats
occupied
that
those
who
were
uncertain
of
the
fate
of
their
relatives
and
friends
had
much
to
make
them
anxious
and
troubled
and
that
it
is
not
possible
to
look
into
another
consciousness
and
say
what
is
written
there
but
dealing
with
mental
conditions
as
far
as
they
are
delineated
by
facial
and
bodily
expressions
i
think
joy
relief
gratitude
were
the
dominant
emotions
written
on
the
faces
of
those
who
climbed
the
and
were
hauled
up
in
cradles
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
no
one
in
any
one
boat
knew
who
were
saved
in
other
boats
few
knew
even
how
many
boats
there
were
and
how
many
passengers
could
be
saved
it
was
at
the
time
probable
that
friends
would
follow
them
to
the
carpathia
or
be
found
on
other
steamers
or
even
on
the
pier
at
which
we
landed
the
hysterical
scenes
that
have
been
described
are
imaginative
true
one
woman
did
fill
the
saloon
with
hysterical
cries
immediately
after
coming
aboard
but
she
could
not
have
known
for
a
certainty
that
any
of
her
friends
were
lost
probably
the
sense
of
relief
after
some
hours
of
journeying
about
the
sea
was
too
much
for
her
for
a
time
one
of
the
first
things
we
did
was
to
crowd
round
a
steward
with
a
bundle
of
telegraph
forms
he
was
the
bearer
of
the
welcome
news
that
passengers
might
send
marconigrams
to
their
relatives
free
of
charge
and
soon
he
bore
away
the
first
sheaf
of
hastily
scribbled
messages
to
the
operator
by
the
time
the
last
boatload
was
aboard
the
pile
must
have
risen
high
in
the
marconi
cabin
we
learned
afterwards
that
many
of
these
never
reached
their
destination
and
this
is
not
a
matter
for
surprise
there
was
only
one
operator
cottam
on
board
and
although
he
was
assisted
to
some
extent
later
when
bride
from
the
titanic
had
recovered
from
his
injuries
sufficiently
to
work
the
apparatus
he
had
so
much
to
do
that
he
fell
asleep
over
this
work
on
tuesday
night
after
three
days
continuous
duty
without
rest
but
we
did
not
know
the
messages
were
held
back
and
imagined
our
friends
were
aware
of
our
safety
then
too
a
of
the
rescued
was
held
in
the
carpathia
saloon
on
the
monday
and
this
was
marconied
to
land
in
advance
of
all
messages
it
seemed
certain
then
that
friends
at
home
would
have
all
anxiety
removed
but
there
were
mistakes
in
the
official
list
first
telegraphed
the
experience
of
my
own
friends
illustrates
this
the
marconigram
i
wrote
never
got
through
to
england
nor
was
my
name
ever
mentioned
in
any
list
of
the
saved
even
a
week
after
landing
in
new
york
i
saw
it
in
a
final
list
of
the
missing
and
it
seemed
certain
that
i
had
never
reached
the
carpathia
so
much
so
that
as
i
write
there
are
before
me
obituary
notices
from
the
english
papers
giving
a
short
sketch
of
my
life
in
england
after
landing
in
new
york
and
realizing
from
the
lists
of
the
saved
which
a
reporter
showed
me
that
my
friends
had
no
news
since
the
titanic
sank
on
monday
morning
until
that
night
thursday
i
cabled
to
england
at
once
as
i
had
but
two
shillings
rescued
from
the
titanic
the
white
star
line
paid
for
the
cables
but
the
messages
were
not
delivered
until
next
morning
at
my
friends
read
in
the
papers
a
short
account
of
the
disaster
which
i
had
supplied
to
the
press
so
that
they
knew
of
my
safety
and
experiences
in
the
wreck
almost
at
the
same
time
i
am
grateful
to
remember
that
many
of
my
friends
in
london
refused
to
count
me
among
the
missing
during
the
three
days
when
i
was
so
reported
there
is
another
side
to
this
record
of
how
the
news
came
through
and
a
sad
one
indeed
again
i
wish
it
were
not
necessary
to
tell
such
things
but
since
they
all
bear
on
the
equipment
of
the
lines
powerful
marconi
apparatus
relays
of
operators
it
is
best
they
should
be
told
the
name
of
an
american
gentleman
the
same
who
sat
near
me
in
the
library
on
sunday
afternoon
and
whom
i
identified
later
from
a
photograph
was
consistently
reported
in
the
lists
as
saved
and
aboard
the
carpathia
his
son
journeyed
to
new
york
to
meet
him
rejoicing
at
his
deliverance
and
never
found
him
there
when
i
met
his
family
some
days
later
and
was
able
to
give
them
some
details
of
his
life
aboard
ship
it
seemed
almost
cruel
to
tell
them
of
the
opposite
experience
that
had
befallen
my
friends
at
home
returning
to
the
journey
of
the
carpathia
the
last
boatload
of
passengers
was
taken
aboard
at
the
lifeboats
were
hauled
on
deck
while
the
collapsibles
were
abandoned
and
the
carpathia
proceeded
to
steam
round
the
scene
of
the
wreck
in
the
hope
of
picking
up
anyone
floating
on
wreckage
before
doing
so
the
captain
arranged
in
the
saloon
a
service
over
the
spot
where
the
titanic
sank
as
nearly
as
could
be
calculated
a
service
as
he
said
of
respect
to
those
who
were
lost
and
of
gratitude
for
those
who
were
saved
she
cruised
round
and
round
the
scene
but
found
nothing
to
indicate
there
was
any
hope
of
picking
up
more
passengers
and
as
the
californian
had
now
arrived
followed
shortly
afterwards
by
the
birma
a
russian
tramp
steamer
captain
rostron
decided
to
leave
any
further
search
to
them
and
to
make
all
speed
with
the
rescued
to
land
as
we
moved
round
there
was
surprisingly
little
wreckage
to
be
seen
wooden
and
small
pieces
of
other
wood
but
nothing
of
any
size
but
covering
the
sea
in
huge
patches
was
a
mass
of
seaweed
as
we
called
it
for
want
of
a
name
it
was
said
to
be
cork
but
i
never
heard
definitely
its
correct
description
the
problem
of
where
to
land
us
had
next
to
be
decided
the
carpathia
was
bound
for
gibraltar
and
the
captain
might
continue
his
journey
there
landing
us
at
the
azores
on
the
way
but
he
would
require
more
linen
and
provisions
the
passengers
were
mostly
women
and
children
dishevelled
and
in
need
of
many
attentions
he
could
not
give
them
then
too
he
would
soon
be
out
of
the
range
of
wireless
communication
with
the
weak
apparatus
his
ship
had
and
he
soon
decided
against
that
course
halifax
was
the
nearest
in
point
of
distance
but
this
meant
steaming
north
through
the
ice
and
he
thought
his
passengers
did
not
want
to
see
more
ice
he
headed
back
therefore
to
new
york
which
he
had
left
the
previous
thursday
working
all
afternoon
along
the
edge
of
the
which
stretched
away
north
as
far
as
the
unaided
eye
could
reach
i
have
wondered
since
if
we
could
possibly
have
landed
our
passengers
on
this
from
the
lifeboats
and
gone
back
to
pick
up
those
swimming
had
we
known
it
was
there
i
should
think
it
quite
feasible
to
have
done
so
it
was
certainly
an
extraordinary
sight
to
stand
on
deck
and
see
the
sea
covered
with
solid
ice
white
and
dazzling
in
the
sun
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
icebergs
we
ran
close
up
only
two
or
three
hundred
yards
away
and
steamed
parallel
to
the
floe
until
it
ended
towards
night
and
we
saw
to
our
infinite
satisfaction
the
last
of
the
icebergs
and
the
field
fading
away
astern
many
of
the
rescued
have
no
wish
ever
to
see
an
iceberg
again
we
learnt
afterwards
the
field
was
nearly
seventy
miles
long
and
twelve
miles
wide
and
had
lain
between
us
and
the
birma
on
her
way
to
the
rescue
boxhall
testified
that
he
had
crossed
the
grand
banks
many
times
but
had
never
seen
before
the
testimony
of
the
captains
and
officers
of
other
steamers
in
the
neighbourhood
is
of
the
same
kind
they
had
never
seen
so
many
icebergs
this
time
of
the
year
or
never
seen
such
dangerous
ice
floes
and
threatening
bergs
undoubtedly
the
titanic
was
faced
that
night
with
unusual
and
unexpected
conditions
of
ice
the
captain
knew
not
the
extent
of
these
conditions
but
he
knew
somewhat
of
their
existence
alas
that
he
heeded
not
their
warning
during
the
day
the
bodies
of
eight
of
the
crew
were
committed
to
the
deep
four
of
them
had
been
taken
out
of
the
boats
dead
and
four
died
during
the
day
the
engines
were
stopped
and
all
passengers
on
deck
bared
their
heads
while
a
short
service
was
read
when
it
was
over
the
ship
steamed
on
again
to
carry
the
living
back
to
land
the
passengers
on
the
carpathia
were
by
now
hard
at
work
finding
clothing
for
the
survivors
the
barber
shop
was
raided
for
ties
collars
combs
of
which
it
happened
there
was
a
large
stock
in
hand
one
good
samaritan
went
round
the
ship
with
a
box
of
offering
them
indiscriminately
to
all
in
some
cases
clothing
could
not
be
found
for
the
ladies
and
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
time
on
board
in
their
and
cloaks
in
which
they
came
away
from
the
titanic
they
even
slept
in
them
for
in
the
absence
of
berths
women
had
to
sleep
on
the
floor
of
the
saloons
and
in
the
library
each
night
on
straw
and
here
it
was
not
possible
to
undress
properly
the
men
were
given
the
floor
and
a
supply
of
blankets
but
the
room
was
small
and
some
elected
to
sleep
out
on
deck
i
found
a
pile
of
towels
on
the
bathroom
floor
ready
for
next
morning
baths
and
made
up
a
very
comfortable
bed
on
these
later
i
was
waked
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
man
offering
me
a
berth
in
his
cabin
another
occupant
was
unable
to
leave
his
berth
for
physical
reasons
and
so
the
cabin
could
not
be
given
up
to
ladies
on
tuesday
the
survivors
met
in
the
saloon
and
formed
a
committee
among
themselves
to
collect
subscriptions
for
a
general
fund
out
of
which
it
was
resolved
by
vote
to
provide
as
far
as
possible
for
the
destitute
among
the
steerage
passengers
to
present
a
loving
cup
to
captain
rostron
and
medals
to
the
officers
and
crew
of
the
carpathia
and
to
divide
any
surplus
among
the
crew
of
the
titanic
the
work
of
this
committee
is
not
yet
june
at
an
end
but
all
the
resolutions
except
the
last
one
have
been
acted
upon
and
that
is
now
receiving
the
attention
of
the
committee
the
presentations
to
the
captain
and
crew
were
made
the
day
the
carpathia
returned
to
new
york
from
her
mediterranean
trip
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
all
the
survivors
to
know
that
the
united
states
senate
has
recognized
the
service
rendered
to
humanity
by
the
carpathia
and
has
voted
captain
rostron
a
gold
medal
commemorative
of
the
rescue
on
the
afternoon
of
tuesday
i
visited
the
steerage
in
company
with
a
to
take
down
the
names
of
all
who
were
saved
we
grouped
them
into
nationalities
english
irish
and
swedish
mostly
and
learnt
from
them
their
names
and
homes
the
amount
of
money
they
possessed
and
whether
they
had
friends
in
america
the
irish
girls
almost
universally
had
no
money
rescued
from
the
wreck
and
were
going
to
friends
in
new
york
or
places
near
while
the
swedish
passengers
among
whom
were
a
considerable
number
of
men
had
saved
the
greater
part
of
their
money
and
in
addition
had
railway
tickets
through
to
their
destinations
inland
the
saving
of
their
money
marked
a
curious
racial
difference
for
which
i
can
offer
no
explanation
no
doubt
the
irish
girls
never
had
very
much
but
they
must
have
had
the
necessary
amount
fixed
by
the
immigration
laws
there
were
some
pitiful
cases
of
women
with
children
and
the
husband
lost
some
with
one
or
two
children
saved
and
the
others
lost
in
one
case
a
whole
family
was
missing
and
only
a
friend
left
to
tell
of
them
among
the
irish
group
was
one
girl
of
really
remarkable
beauty
black
hair
and
deep
violet
eyes
with
long
lashes
and
perfectly
shaped
features
and
quite
young
not
more
than
eighteen
or
twenty
i
think
she
lost
no
relatives
on
the
titanic
the
following
letter
to
the
london
times
is
reproduced
here
to
show
something
of
what
our
feeling
was
on
board
the
carpathia
towards
the
loss
of
the
titanic
it
was
written
soon
after
we
had
the
definite
information
on
the
wednesday
that
ice
warnings
had
been
sent
to
the
titanic
and
when
we
all
felt
that
something
must
be
done
to
awaken
public
opinion
to
safeguard
ocean
travel
in
the
future
we
were
not
aware
of
course
how
much
the
outside
world
knew
and
it
seemed
well
to
do
something
to
inform
the
english
public
of
what
had
happened
at
as
early
an
opportunity
as
possible
i
have
not
had
occasion
to
change
any
of
the
opinions
expressed
in
this
letter
sir
as
one
of
few
surviving
englishmen
from
the
steamship
titanic
which
sank
in
on
monday
morning
last
i
am
asking
you
to
lay
before
your
readers
a
few
facts
concerning
the
disaster
in
the
hope
that
something
may
be
done
in
the
near
future
to
ensure
the
safety
of
that
portion
of
the
travelling
public
who
use
the
atlantic
highway
for
business
or
pleasure
i
wish
to
dissociate
myself
entirely
from
any
report
that
would
seek
to
fix
the
responsibility
on
any
person
or
persons
or
body
of
people
and
by
simply
calling
attention
to
matters
of
fact
the
authenticity
of
which
is
i
think
beyond
question
and
can
be
established
in
any
court
of
inquiry
to
allow
your
readers
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
as
to
the
responsibility
for
the
collision
first
that
it
was
known
to
those
in
charge
of
the
titanic
that
we
were
in
the
iceberg
region
that
the
atmospheric
and
temperature
conditions
suggested
the
near
presence
of
icebergs
that
a
wireless
message
was
received
from
a
ship
ahead
of
us
warning
us
that
they
had
been
seen
in
the
locality
of
which
latitude
and
longitude
were
given
second
that
at
the
time
of
the
collision
the
titanic
was
running
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
third
that
the
accommodation
for
saving
passengers
and
crew
was
totally
inadequate
being
sufficient
only
for
a
total
of
about
this
gave
with
the
highest
possible
complement
of
a
less
than
one
in
three
chance
of
being
saved
in
the
case
of
accident
fourth
that
the
number
landed
in
the
carpathia
approximately
is
a
high
percentage
of
the
possible
and
bears
excellent
testimony
to
the
courage
resource
and
devotion
to
duty
of
the
officers
and
crew
of
the
vessel
many
instances
of
their
nobility
and
personal
are
within
our
possession
and
we
know
that
they
did
all
they
could
do
with
the
means
at
their
disposal
fifth
that
the
practice
of
running
mail
and
passenger
vessels
through
fog
and
iceberg
regions
at
a
high
speed
is
a
common
one
they
are
timed
to
run
almost
as
an
express
train
is
run
and
they
can
not
therefore
slow
down
more
than
a
few
knots
in
time
of
possible
danger
i
have
neither
knowledge
nor
experience
to
say
what
remedies
i
consider
should
be
applied
but
perhaps
the
following
suggestions
may
serve
as
a
help
first
that
no
vessel
should
be
allowed
to
leave
a
british
port
without
sufficient
boat
and
other
accommodation
to
allow
each
passenger
and
member
of
the
crew
a
seat
and
that
at
the
time
of
booking
this
fact
should
be
pointed
out
to
a
passenger
and
the
number
of
the
seat
in
the
particular
boat
allotted
to
him
then
second
that
as
soon
as
is
practicable
after
sailing
each
passenger
should
go
through
boat
drill
in
company
with
the
crew
assigned
to
his
boat
third
that
each
passenger
boat
engaged
in
the
transatlantic
service
should
be
instructed
to
slow
down
to
a
few
knots
when
in
the
iceberg
region
and
should
be
fitted
with
an
efficient
searchlight
yours
faithfully
lawrence
beesley
it
seemed
well
too
while
on
the
carpathia
to
prepare
as
accurate
an
account
as
possible
of
the
disaster
and
to
have
this
ready
for
the
press
in
order
to
calm
public
opinion
and
to
forestall
the
incorrect
and
hysterical
accounts
which
some
american
reporters
are
in
the
habit
of
preparing
on
occasions
of
this
kind
the
first
impression
is
often
the
most
permanent
and
in
a
disaster
of
this
magnitude
where
exact
and
accurate
information
is
so
necessary
preparation
of
a
report
was
essential
it
was
written
in
odd
corners
of
the
deck
and
saloon
of
the
carpathia
and
fell
it
seemed
very
happily
into
the
hands
of
the
one
reporter
who
could
best
deal
with
it
the
associated
press
i
understand
it
was
the
first
report
that
came
through
and
had
a
good
deal
of
the
effect
intended
the
carpathia
returned
to
new
york
in
almost
every
kind
of
climatic
conditions
icebergs
and
bitter
cold
to
commence
with
brilliant
warm
sun
thunder
and
lightning
in
the
middle
of
one
night
and
so
closely
did
the
peal
follow
the
flash
that
women
in
the
saloon
leaped
up
in
alarm
saying
rockets
were
being
sent
up
again
cold
winds
most
of
the
time
fogs
every
morning
and
during
a
good
part
of
one
day
with
the
foghorn
blowing
constantly
rain
choppy
sea
with
the
spray
blowing
overboard
and
coming
in
through
the
saloon
windows
we
said
we
had
almost
everything
but
hot
weather
and
stormy
seas
so
that
when
we
were
told
that
nantucket
lightship
had
been
sighted
on
thursday
morning
from
the
bridge
a
great
sigh
of
relief
went
round
to
think
new
york
and
land
would
be
reached
before
next
morning
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
good
many
felt
the
waiting
period
of
those
four
days
very
trying
the
ship
crowded
far
beyond
its
limits
of
comfort
the
want
of
necessities
of
clothing
and
toilet
and
above
all
the
anticipation
of
meeting
with
relatives
on
the
pier
with
in
many
cases
the
knowledge
that
other
friends
were
left
behind
and
would
not
return
home
again
a
few
looked
forward
to
meeting
on
the
pier
their
friends
to
whom
they
had
said
au
revoir
on
the
titanic
deck
brought
there
by
a
faster
boat
they
said
or
at
any
rate
to
hear
that
they
were
following
behind
us
in
another
boat
a
very
few
indeed
for
the
thought
of
the
icy
water
and
the
many
hours
immersion
seemed
to
weigh
against
such
a
possibility
but
we
encouraged
them
to
hope
the
californian
and
the
birma
had
picked
some
up
stranger
things
have
happened
and
we
had
all
been
through
strange
experiences
but
in
the
midst
of
this
rather
tense
feeling
one
fact
stands
out
as
remarkable
no
one
was
captain
rostron
testified
that
on
tuesday
the
doctor
reported
a
clean
bill
of
health
except
for
and
shaken
nerves
there
were
none
of
the
illnesses
supposed
to
follow
from
exposure
for
hours
in
the
cold
night
and
it
must
be
remembered
a
considerable
number
swam
about
for
some
time
when
the
titanic
sank
and
then
either
sat
for
hours
in
their
wet
things
or
lay
flat
on
an
upturned
boat
with
the
sea
water
washing
partly
over
them
until
they
were
taken
off
in
a
lifeboat
no
scenes
of
women
weeping
and
brooding
over
their
losses
hour
by
hour
until
they
were
driven
mad
with
grief
yet
all
this
has
been
reported
to
the
press
by
people
on
board
the
carpathia
these
women
met
their
sorrow
with
the
sublimest
courage
came
on
deck
and
talked
with
their
and
women
face
to
face
and
in
the
midst
of
their
loss
did
not
forget
to
rejoice
with
those
who
had
joined
their
friends
on
the
carpathia
deck
or
come
with
them
in
a
boat
there
was
no
need
for
those
ashore
to
call
the
carpathia
a
or
to
send
coroners
and
coffins
to
the
pier
to
meet
her
her
passengers
were
generally
in
good
health
and
they
did
not
pretend
they
were
not
presently
land
came
in
sight
and
very
good
it
was
to
see
it
again
it
was
eight
days
since
we
left
southampton
but
the
time
seemed
to
have
stretched
out
to
the
crack
of
doom
and
to
have
become
eight
weeks
instead
so
many
dramatic
incidents
had
been
crowded
into
the
last
few
days
that
the
first
four
peaceful
uneventful
days
marked
by
nothing
that
seared
the
memory
had
faded
almost
out
of
recollection
it
needed
an
effort
to
return
to
southampton
cherbourg
and
queenstown
as
though
returning
to
some
event
of
last
year
i
think
we
all
realized
that
time
may
be
measured
more
by
events
than
by
seconds
and
minutes
what
the
astronomer
would
call
april
the
survivors
called
the
sinking
of
the
titanic
the
hours
that
followed
were
designated
being
adrift
in
an
open
sea
and
was
being
rescued
by
the
carpathia
the
clock
was
a
mental
one
and
the
hours
minutes
and
seconds
marked
deeply
on
its
face
were
emotions
strong
and
silent
surrounded
by
tugs
of
every
kind
from
which
as
well
as
from
every
available
building
near
the
river
magnesium
bombs
were
shot
off
by
photographers
while
reporters
shouted
for
news
of
the
disaster
and
photographs
of
passengers
the
carpathia
drew
slowly
to
her
station
at
the
cunard
pier
the
gangways
were
pushed
across
and
we
set
foot
at
last
on
american
soil
very
thankful
grateful
people
the
mental
and
physical
condition
of
the
rescued
as
they
came
ashore
has
here
again
been
greatly
exaggerated
one
description
says
we
were
bordering
on
hallucination
only
now
beginning
to
realize
the
horror
it
is
unfortunate
such
pictures
should
be
presented
to
the
world
there
were
some
painful
scenes
of
meeting
between
relatives
of
those
who
were
lost
but
once
again
women
showed
their
and
went
through
the
ordeal
in
most
cases
with
extraordinary
calm
it
is
well
to
record
that
the
same
account
added
a
few
strangely
enough
are
calm
and
lucid
if
for
few
we
read
a
large
majority
it
will
be
much
nearer
the
true
description
of
the
landing
on
the
cunard
pier
in
new
york
there
seems
to
be
no
adequate
reason
why
a
report
of
such
a
scene
should
depict
mainly
the
sorrow
and
grief
should
seek
for
every
detail
to
satisfy
the
horrible
and
the
morbid
in
the
human
mind
the
first
questions
the
excited
crowds
of
reporters
asked
as
they
crowded
round
were
whether
it
was
true
that
officers
shot
passengers
and
then
themselves
whether
passengers
shot
each
other
whether
any
scenes
of
horror
had
been
noticed
and
what
they
were
it
would
have
been
well
to
have
noticed
the
wonderful
state
of
health
of
most
of
the
rescued
their
gratitude
for
their
deliverance
the
thousand
and
one
things
that
gave
cause
for
rejoicing
in
the
midst
of
so
much
description
of
the
hysterical
side
of
the
scene
place
should
be
found
for
the
normal
and
i
venture
to
think
the
normal
was
the
dominant
feature
in
the
landing
that
night
in
the
last
chapter
i
shall
try
to
record
the
persistence
of
the
normal
all
through
the
disaster
nothing
has
been
a
greater
surprise
than
to
find
people
that
do
not
act
in
conditions
of
danger
and
grief
as
they
would
be
generally
supposed
to
act
and
i
must
add
as
they
are
generally
described
as
acting
and
so
with
her
work
of
rescue
well
done
the
good
ship
carpathia
returned
to
new
york
everyone
who
came
in
her
everyone
on
the
dock
and
everyone
who
heard
of
her
journey
will
agree
with
captain
rostron
when
he
says
i
thank
god
that
i
was
within
wireless
hailing
distance
and
that
i
got
there
in
time
to
pick
up
the
survivors
of
the
wreck
chapter
viii
the
lessons
taught
by
the
loss
of
the
titanic
one
of
the
most
pitiful
things
in
the
relations
of
human
beings
to
each
other
the
action
and
reaction
of
events
that
is
called
concretely
human
life
is
that
every
now
and
then
some
of
them
should
be
called
upon
to
lay
down
their
lives
from
no
sense
of
imperative
calculated
duty
such
as
inspires
the
soldier
or
the
sailor
but
suddenly
without
any
previous
knowledge
or
warning
of
danger
without
any
opportunity
of
escape
and
without
any
desire
to
risk
such
conditions
of
danger
of
their
own
free
will
it
is
a
blot
on
our
civilization
that
these
things
are
necessary
from
time
to
time
to
arouse
those
responsible
for
the
safety
of
human
life
from
the
lethargic
selfishness
which
has
governed
them
the
titanic
two
thousand
odd
passengers
went
aboard
thinking
they
were
on
an
absolutely
safe
ship
and
all
the
time
there
were
many
people
designers
builders
experts
government
officials
who
knew
there
were
insufficient
boats
on
board
that
the
titanic
had
no
right
to
go
fast
in
iceberg
regions
who
knew
these
things
and
took
no
steps
and
enacted
no
laws
to
prevent
their
happening
not
that
they
omitted
to
do
these
things
deliberately
but
were
lulled
into
a
state
of
selfish
inaction
from
which
it
needed
such
a
tragedy
as
this
to
arouse
them
it
was
a
cruel
necessity
which
demanded
that
a
few
should
die
to
arouse
many
millions
to
a
sense
of
their
own
insecurity
to
the
fact
that
for
years
the
possibility
of
such
a
disaster
has
been
imminent
passengers
have
known
none
of
these
things
and
while
no
good
end
would
have
been
served
by
relating
to
them
needless
tales
of
danger
on
the
high
seas
one
thing
is
certain
that
had
they
known
them
many
would
not
have
travelled
in
such
conditions
and
thereby
safeguards
would
soon
have
been
forced
on
the
builders
the
companies
and
the
government
but
there
were
people
who
knew
and
did
not
fail
to
call
attention
to
the
dangers
in
the
house
of
commons
the
matter
has
been
frequently
brought
up
privately
and
an
american
naval
officer
captain
boden
in
an
article
that
has
since
been
widely
reproduced
called
attention
to
the
defects
of
this
very
ship
the
titanic
taking
her
as
an
example
of
all
other
liners
and
pointed
out
that
she
was
not
unsinkable
and
had
not
proper
boat
accommodation
the
question
then
of
responsibility
for
the
loss
of
the
titanic
must
be
considered
not
from
any
idea
that
blame
should
be
laid
here
or
there
and
a
scapegoat
provided
that
is
a
waste
of
time
but
if
a
fixing
of
responsibility
leads
to
quick
and
efficient
remedy
then
it
should
be
done
relentlessly
our
simple
duty
to
those
whom
the
titanic
carried
down
with
her
demands
no
less
dealing
first
with
the
precautions
for
the
safety
of
the
ship
as
apart
from
safety
appliances
there
can
be
no
question
i
suppose
that
the
direct
responsibility
for
the
loss
of
the
titanic
and
so
many
lives
must
be
laid
on
her
captain
he
was
responsible
for
setting
the
course
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
for
the
speed
she
was
travelling
and
he
alone
would
have
the
power
to
decide
whether
or
not
speed
must
be
slackened
with
icebergs
ahead
no
officer
would
have
any
right
to
interfere
in
the
navigation
although
they
would
no
doubt
be
consulted
nor
would
any
official
connected
with
the
management
of
the
line
ismay
for
example
be
allowed
to
direct
the
captain
in
these
matters
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
tried
to
do
so
the
very
fact
that
the
captain
of
a
ship
has
such
absolute
authority
increases
his
responsibility
enormously
even
supposing
the
white
star
line
and
ismay
had
urged
him
before
sailing
to
make
a
record
again
an
assumption
they
can
not
be
held
directly
responsible
for
the
collision
he
was
in
charge
of
the
lives
of
everyone
on
board
and
no
one
but
he
was
supposed
to
estimate
the
risk
of
travelling
at
the
speed
he
did
when
ice
was
reported
ahead
of
him
his
action
can
not
be
justified
on
the
ground
of
prudent
seamanship
but
the
question
of
indirect
responsibility
raises
at
once
many
issues
and
i
think
removes
from
captain
smith
a
good
deal
of
personal
responsibility
for
the
loss
of
his
ship
some
of
these
issues
it
will
be
well
to
consider
in
the
first
place
disabusing
our
minds
again
of
the
knowledge
that
the
titanic
struck
an
iceberg
and
sank
let
us
estimate
the
probabilities
of
such
a
thing
happening
an
iceberg
is
small
and
occupies
little
room
by
comparison
with
the
broad
ocean
on
which
it
floats
and
the
chances
of
another
small
object
like
a
ship
colliding
with
it
and
being
sunk
are
very
small
the
chances
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
in
a
million
this
is
not
a
figure
of
speech
that
is
the
actual
risk
for
total
loss
by
collision
with
an
iceberg
as
accepted
by
insurance
companies
the
accident
was
what
sunk
the
titanic
even
so
had
captain
smith
been
alone
in
taking
that
risk
he
would
have
had
to
bear
all
the
blame
for
the
resulting
disaster
but
it
seems
he
is
not
alone
the
same
risk
has
been
taken
over
and
over
again
by
fast
liners
in
fog
and
in
iceberg
regions
their
captains
have
taken
the
long
very
long
chance
many
times
and
won
every
time
he
took
it
as
he
had
done
many
times
before
and
lost
of
course
the
chances
that
night
of
striking
an
iceberg
were
much
greater
than
one
in
a
million
they
had
been
enormously
increased
by
the
extreme
southerly
position
of
icebergs
and
field
ice
and
by
the
unusual
number
of
the
former
thinking
over
the
scene
that
met
our
eyes
from
the
deck
of
the
carpathia
after
we
boarded
her
the
great
number
of
icebergs
wherever
the
eye
could
reach
the
chances
of
hitting
one
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
seemed
small
indeed
the
more
one
thinks
about
the
carpathia
coming
at
full
speed
through
all
those
icebergs
in
the
darkness
the
more
inexplicable
does
it
seem
true
the
captain
had
an
extra
lookout
watch
and
every
sense
of
every
man
on
the
bridge
alert
to
detect
the
least
sign
of
danger
and
again
he
was
not
going
so
fast
as
the
titanic
and
would
have
his
ship
under
more
control
but
granted
all
that
he
appears
to
have
taken
a
great
risk
as
he
dogged
and
twisted
round
the
awful
monsters
in
the
dark
night
does
it
mean
that
the
risk
is
not
so
great
as
we
who
have
seen
the
abnormal
and
not
the
normal
side
of
taking
risks
with
icebergs
might
suppose
he
had
his
own
ship
and
passengers
to
consider
and
he
had
no
right
to
take
too
great
a
risk
but
captain
smith
could
not
know
icebergs
were
there
in
such
numbers
what
warnings
he
had
of
them
is
not
yet
thoroughly
established
there
were
probably
three
but
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
that
he
knew
that
any
vessel
had
seen
them
in
such
quantities
as
we
saw
them
monday
morning
in
fact
it
is
unthinkable
he
thought
no
doubt
he
was
taking
an
ordinary
risk
and
it
turned
out
to
be
an
extraordinary
one
to
read
some
criticisms
it
would
seem
as
if
he
deliberately
ran
his
ship
in
defiance
of
all
custom
through
a
region
infested
with
icebergs
and
did
a
thing
which
no
one
has
ever
done
before
that
he
outraged
all
precedent
by
not
slowing
down
but
it
is
plain
that
he
did
not
every
captain
who
has
run
full
speed
through
fog
and
iceberg
regions
is
to
blame
for
the
disaster
as
much
as
he
is
they
got
through
and
he
did
not
other
liners
can
go
faster
than
the
titanic
could
possibly
do
had
they
struck
ice
they
would
have
been
injured
even
more
deeply
than
she
was
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
force
of
impact
varies
as
the
of
the
velocity
it
is
four
times
as
much
at
sixteen
knots
as
at
eight
knots
nine
times
as
much
at
and
so
on
and
with
not
much
margin
of
time
left
for
these
fast
boats
they
must
go
full
speed
ahead
nearly
all
the
time
remember
how
they
advertise
to
leave
new
york
wednesday
dine
in
london
the
following
monday
and
it
is
done
regularly
much
as
an
express
train
is
run
to
time
their
officers
too
would
have
been
less
able
to
avoid
a
collision
than
murdock
of
the
titanic
was
for
at
the
greater
speed
they
would
be
on
the
iceberg
in
shorter
time
many
passengers
can
tell
of
crossing
with
fog
a
good
deal
of
the
way
sometimes
almost
all
the
way
and
they
have
been
only
a
few
hours
late
at
the
end
of
the
journey
so
that
it
is
the
custom
that
is
at
fault
not
one
particular
captain
custom
is
established
largely
by
demand
and
supply
too
is
the
answer
to
demand
what
the
public
demanded
the
white
star
line
supplied
and
so
both
the
public
and
the
line
are
concerned
with
the
question
of
indirect
responsibility
the
public
has
demanded
more
and
more
every
year
greater
speed
as
well
as
greater
comfort
and
by
ceasing
to
patronize
the
boats
has
gradually
forced
the
pace
to
what
it
is
at
present
not
that
speed
in
itself
is
a
dangerous
thing
it
is
sometimes
much
safer
to
go
quickly
than
slowly
but
that
given
the
facilities
for
speed
and
the
stimulus
exerted
by
the
constant
public
demand
for
it
occasions
arise
when
the
judgment
of
those
in
command
of
a
ship
becomes
swayed
largely
unconsciously
no
doubt
in
favour
of
taking
risks
which
the
smaller
liners
would
never
take
the
demand
on
the
skipper
of
a
boat
like
the
californian
for
example
which
lay
nineteen
miles
away
with
her
engines
stopped
is
infinitesimal
compared
with
that
on
captain
smith
an
old
traveller
told
me
on
the
carpathia
that
he
has
often
grumbled
to
the
officers
for
what
he
called
absurd
precautions
in
lying
to
and
wasting
his
time
which
he
regarded
as
very
valuable
but
after
hearing
of
the
titanic
loss
he
recognized
that
he
was
to
some
extent
responsible
for
the
speed
at
which
she
had
travelled
and
would
never
be
so
again
he
had
been
one
of
the
travelling
public
who
had
constantly
demanded
to
be
taken
to
his
journey
end
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
had
made
a
row
about
it
if
he
was
likely
to
be
late
there
are
some
business
men
to
whom
the
five
or
six
days
on
board
are
exceedingly
irksome
and
represent
a
waste
of
time
even
an
hour
saved
at
the
journey
end
is
a
consideration
to
them
and
if
the
demand
is
not
always
a
conscious
one
it
is
there
as
an
unconscious
factor
always
urging
the
highest
speed
of
which
the
ship
is
capable
the
man
who
demands
fast
travel
unreasonably
must
undoubtedly
take
his
share
in
the
responsibility
he
asks
to
be
taken
over
at
a
speed
which
will
land
him
in
something
over
four
days
he
forgets
perhaps
that
columbus
took
ninety
days
in
a
boat
and
that
only
fifty
years
ago
paddle
steamers
took
six
weeks
and
all
the
time
the
demand
is
greater
and
the
strain
is
more
the
public
demand
speed
and
luxury
the
lines
supply
it
until
presently
the
safety
limit
is
reached
the
undue
risk
is
taken
and
the
titanic
goes
down
all
of
us
who
have
cried
for
greater
speed
must
take
our
share
in
the
responsibility
the
expression
of
such
a
desire
and
the
discontent
with
slow
travel
are
the
seed
sown
in
the
minds
of
men
to
bear
fruit
presently
in
an
insistence
on
greater
speed
we
may
not
have
done
so
directly
but
we
may
perhaps
have
talked
about
it
and
thought
about
it
and
we
know
no
action
begins
without
thought
the
white
star
line
has
received
very
rough
handling
from
some
of
the
press
but
the
greater
part
of
this
criticism
seems
to
be
unwarranted
and
to
arise
from
the
desire
to
find
a
scapegoat
after
all
they
had
made
better
provision
for
the
passengers
the
titanic
carried
than
any
other
line
has
done
for
they
had
built
what
they
believed
to
be
a
huge
lifeboat
unsinkable
in
all
ordinary
conditions
those
who
embarked
in
her
were
almost
certainly
in
the
safest
ship
along
with
the
olympic
afloat
she
was
probably
quite
immune
from
the
ordinary
effects
of
wind
waves
and
collisions
at
sea
and
needed
to
fear
nothing
but
running
on
a
rock
or
what
was
worse
a
floating
iceberg
for
the
effects
of
collision
were
so
far
as
damage
was
concerned
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
a
rock
and
the
danger
greater
for
one
is
charted
and
the
other
is
not
then
too
while
the
theory
of
the
unsinkable
boat
has
been
destroyed
at
the
same
time
as
the
boat
itself
we
should
not
forget
that
it
served
a
useful
purpose
on
deck
that
night
it
eliminated
largely
the
possibility
of
panic
and
those
rushes
for
the
boats
which
might
have
swamped
some
of
them
i
do
not
wish
for
a
moment
to
suggest
that
such
things
would
have
happened
because
the
more
information
that
comes
to
hand
of
the
conduct
of
the
people
on
board
the
more
wonderful
seems
the
complete
of
all
even
when
the
last
boats
had
gone
and
nothing
but
the
rising
waters
met
their
eyes
only
that
the
generally
entertained
theory
rendered
such
things
less
probable
the
theory
indeed
was
really
a
safeguard
though
built
on
a
false
premise
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
white
star
line
instructed
the
captain
to
push
the
boat
or
to
make
any
records
the
probabilities
are
that
no
such
attempt
would
be
made
on
the
first
trip
the
general
instructions
to
their
commanders
bear
quite
the
other
interpretation
it
will
be
well
to
quote
them
in
full
as
issued
to
the
press
during
the
sittings
of
the
united
states
senate
committee
to
commanders
must
distinctly
understand
that
the
issue
of
regulations
does
not
in
any
way
relieve
them
from
responsibility
for
the
safe
and
efficient
navigation
of
their
respective
vessels
and
they
are
also
enjoined
to
remember
that
they
must
run
no
risks
which
might
by
any
possibility
result
in
accident
to
their
ships
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
will
ever
bear
in
mind
that
the
safety
of
the
lives
and
property
entrusted
to
their
care
is
the
ruling
principle
that
should
govern
them
in
the
navigation
of
their
vessels
and
that
no
supposed
gain
in
expedition
or
saving
of
time
on
the
voyage
is
to
be
purchased
at
the
risk
of
accident
commanders
are
reminded
that
the
steamers
are
to
a
great
extent
uninsured
and
that
their
own
livelihood
as
well
as
the
success
depends
upon
immunity
from
accident
no
precaution
which
ensures
safe
navigation
is
to
be
considered
excessive
nothing
could
be
plainer
than
these
instructions
and
had
they
been
obeyed
the
disaster
would
never
have
happened
they
warn
commanders
against
the
only
thing
left
as
a
menace
to
their
unsinkable
boat
the
lack
of
precaution
which
ensures
safe
navigation
in
addition
the
white
star
line
had
complied
to
the
full
extent
with
the
requirements
of
the
british
government
their
ship
had
been
subjected
to
an
inspection
so
rigid
that
as
one
officer
remarked
in
evidence
it
became
a
nuisance
the
board
of
trade
employs
the
best
experts
and
knows
the
dangers
that
attend
ocean
travel
and
the
precautions
that
should
be
taken
by
every
commander
if
these
precautions
are
not
taken
it
will
be
necessary
to
legislate
until
they
are
no
motorist
is
allowed
to
career
at
full
speed
along
a
public
highway
in
dangerous
conditions
and
it
should
be
an
offence
for
a
captain
to
do
the
same
on
the
high
seas
with
a
ship
full
of
unsuspecting
passengers
they
have
entrusted
their
lives
to
the
government
of
their
country
through
its
regulations
and
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
protection
in
as
they
are
in
oxford
street
or
broadway
the
open
sea
should
no
longer
be
regarded
as
a
neutral
zone
where
no
country
police
laws
are
operative
of
course
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
drafting
international
regulations
many
governments
would
have
to
be
consulted
and
many
difficulties
that
seem
insuperable
overcome
but
that
is
the
purpose
for
which
governments
are
employed
that
is
why
experts
and
ministers
of
governments
are
appointed
and
paid
to
overcome
difficulties
for
the
people
who
appoint
them
and
who
expect
them
among
other
things
to
protect
their
lives
the
american
government
must
share
the
same
responsibility
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
fix
it
on
the
british
board
of
trade
for
the
reason
that
the
boats
were
built
in
england
and
inspected
there
by
british
officials
they
carried
american
citizens
largely
and
entered
american
ports
it
would
have
been
the
simplest
matter
for
the
united
states
government
to
veto
the
entry
of
any
ship
which
did
not
conform
to
its
laws
of
regulating
speed
in
conditions
of
fog
and
icebergs
had
they
provided
such
laws
the
fact
is
that
the
american
nation
has
practically
no
mercantile
marine
and
in
time
of
a
disaster
such
as
this
it
forgets
perhaps
that
it
has
exactly
the
same
right
and
therefore
the
same
responsibility
as
the
british
government
to
inspect
and
to
legislate
the
right
that
is
easily
enforced
by
refusal
to
allow
entry
the
regulation
of
speed
in
dangerous
regions
could
well
be
undertaken
by
some
fleet
of
international
police
patrol
vessels
with
power
to
stop
if
necessary
any
boat
found
guilty
of
reckless
racing
the
additional
duty
of
warning
ships
of
the
exact
locality
of
icebergs
could
be
performed
by
these
boats
it
would
not
of
course
be
possible
or
advisable
to
fix
a
speed
limit
because
the
region
of
icebergs
varies
in
position
as
the
icebergs
float
south
varies
in
point
of
danger
as
they
melt
and
disappear
and
the
whole
question
has
to
be
left
largely
to
the
judgment
of
the
captain
on
the
spot
but
it
would
be
possible
to
make
it
an
offence
against
the
law
to
go
beyond
a
certain
speed
in
known
conditions
of
danger
so
much
for
the
question
of
regulating
speed
on
the
high
seas
the
secondary
question
of
safety
appliances
is
governed
by
the
same
principle
that
in
the
last
analysis
it
is
not
the
captain
not
the
passenger
not
the
builders
and
owners
but
the
governments
through
their
experts
who
are
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
provision
of
lifesaving
devices
morally
of
course
the
owners
and
builders
are
responsible
but
at
present
moral
responsibility
is
too
weak
an
incentive
in
human
affairs
that
is
the
miserable
part
of
the
whole
wretched
business
to
induce
owners
generally
to
make
every
possible
provision
for
the
lives
of
those
in
their
charge
to
place
human
safety
so
far
above
every
other
consideration
that
no
plan
shall
be
left
unconsidered
no
device
left
untested
by
which
passengers
can
escape
from
a
sinking
ship
but
it
is
not
correct
to
say
as
has
been
said
frequently
that
it
is
greed
and
that
have
characterized
the
policy
of
the
steamship
companies
in
their
failure
to
provide
safety
appliances
these
things
in
themselves
are
not
expensive
they
have
vied
with
each
other
in
making
their
lines
attractive
in
point
of
speed
size
and
comfort
and
they
have
been
quite
justified
in
doing
so
such
things
are
the
product
of
ordinary
competition
between
commercial
houses
where
they
have
all
failed
morally
is
to
extend
to
their
passengers
the
consideration
that
places
their
lives
as
of
more
interest
to
them
than
any
other
conceivable
thing
they
are
not
alone
in
this
thousands
of
other
people
have
done
the
same
thing
and
would
do
it
in
factories
in
workshops
in
mines
did
not
the
government
intervene
and
insist
on
safety
precautions
the
thing
is
a
defect
in
human
life
of
thoughtlessness
for
the
of
our
and
we
are
all
guilty
of
it
in
some
degree
it
is
folly
for
the
public
to
rise
up
now
and
condemn
the
steamship
companies
their
failing
is
the
common
failing
of
the
immorality
of
indifference
the
remedy
is
the
law
and
it
is
the
only
remedy
at
present
that
will
really
accomplish
anything
the
british
law
on
the
subject
dates
from
and
requires
only
twenty
boats
for
a
ship
the
size
of
the
titanic
the
owners
and
builders
have
obeyed
this
law
and
fulfilled
their
legal
responsibility
increase
this
responsibility
and
they
will
fulfil
it
again
and
the
matter
is
ended
so
far
as
appliances
are
concerned
it
should
perhaps
be
mentioned
that
in
a
period
of
ten
years
only
nine
passengers
were
lost
on
british
ships
the
law
seemed
to
be
sufficient
in
fact
the
position
of
the
american
government
however
is
worse
than
that
of
the
british
government
its
regulations
require
more
than
double
the
boat
accommodation
which
the
british
regulations
do
and
yet
it
has
allowed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
its
subjects
to
enter
its
ports
on
boats
that
defied
its
own
laws
had
their
government
not
been
guilty
of
the
same
indifference
passengers
would
not
have
been
allowed
aboard
any
british
ship
lacking
in
the
simple
expedient
again
of
refusing
entry
the
reply
of
the
british
government
to
the
senate
committee
accusing
the
board
of
trade
of
insufficient
requirements
and
lax
inspection
might
well
be
ye
have
a
law
see
to
it
yourselves
it
will
be
well
now
to
consider
briefly
the
various
appliances
that
have
been
suggested
to
ensure
the
safety
of
passengers
and
crew
and
in
doing
so
it
may
be
remembered
that
the
average
man
and
woman
has
the
same
right
as
the
expert
to
consider
and
discuss
these
things
they
are
not
so
technical
as
to
prevent
anyone
of
ordinary
intelligence
from
understanding
their
construction
using
the
term
in
its
widest
sense
we
come
first
to
and
it
is
impossible
to
attempt
a
discussion
here
of
the
exact
constructional
details
of
these
parts
of
a
ship
but
in
order
to
illustrate
briefly
what
is
the
purpose
of
having
bulkheads
we
may
take
the
titanic
as
an
example
she
was
divided
into
sixteen
compartments
by
fifteen
transverse
steel
walls
called
bulkheads
footnote
see
figures
and
page
if
a
hole
is
made
in
the
side
of
the
ship
in
any
one
compartment
steel
doors
seal
off
the
only
openings
in
that
compartment
and
separate
it
as
a
damaged
unit
from
the
rest
of
the
ship
and
the
vessel
is
brought
to
land
in
safety
ships
have
even
put
into
the
nearest
port
for
inspection
after
collision
and
finding
only
one
compartment
full
of
water
and
no
other
damage
have
left
again
for
their
home
port
without
troubling
to
disembark
passengers
and
effect
repairs
the
design
of
the
titanic
bulkheads
calls
for
some
attention
the
scientific
american
in
an
excellent
article
on
the
comparative
safety
of
the
titanic
and
other
types
of
compartments
draws
attention
to
the
following
weaknesses
in
the
former
from
the
point
of
view
of
possible
collision
with
an
iceberg
she
had
no
longitudinal
bulkheads
which
would
subdivide
her
into
smaller
compartments
and
prevent
the
water
filling
the
whole
of
a
large
compartment
probably
too
the
length
of
a
large
compartment
was
in
any
case
too
great
feet
the
mauretania
on
the
other
hand
in
addition
to
transverse
bulkheads
is
fitted
with
longitudinal
torpedo
bulkheads
and
the
space
between
them
and
the
side
of
the
ship
is
utilised
as
a
coal
bunker
then
too
in
the
mauretania
all
bulkheads
are
carried
up
to
the
top
deck
whereas
in
the
case
of
the
titanic
they
reached
in
some
parts
only
to
the
saloon
deck
and
in
others
to
a
lower
deck
still
the
weakness
of
this
being
that
when
the
water
reached
to
the
top
of
a
bulkhead
as
the
ship
sank
by
the
head
it
flowed
over
and
filled
the
next
compartment
the
british
admiralty
which
subsidizes
the
mauretania
and
lusitania
as
fast
cruisers
in
time
of
war
insisted
on
this
type
of
construction
and
it
is
considered
vastly
better
than
that
used
in
the
titanic
the
writer
of
the
article
thinks
it
possible
that
these
ships
might
not
have
sunk
as
the
result
of
a
similar
collision
but
the
ideal
ship
from
the
point
of
bulkhead
construction
he
considers
to
have
been
the
great
eastern
constructed
many
years
ago
by
the
famous
engineer
brunel
so
thorough
was
her
system
of
compartments
divided
and
subdivided
by
many
transverse
and
longitudinal
bulkheads
that
when
she
tore
a
hole
eighty
feet
long
in
her
side
by
striking
a
rock
she
reached
port
in
safety
unfortunately
the
weight
and
cost
of
this
method
was
so
great
that
his
plan
was
subsequently
abandoned
but
it
would
not
be
just
to
say
that
the
construction
of
the
titanic
was
a
serious
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
white
star
line
or
her
builders
on
the
ground
that
her
bulkheads
were
not
so
well
constructed
as
those
of
the
lusitania
and
mauretania
which
were
built
to
fulfil
british
admiralty
regulations
for
time
of
war
an
extraordinary
risk
which
no
builder
of
a
passenger
steamer
as
such
would
be
expected
to
take
into
consideration
when
designing
the
vessel
it
should
be
constantly
borne
in
mind
that
the
titanic
met
extraordinary
conditions
on
the
night
of
the
collision
she
was
probably
the
safest
ship
afloat
in
all
ordinary
conditions
collision
with
an
iceberg
is
not
an
ordinary
risk
but
this
disaster
will
probably
result
in
altering
the
whole
construction
of
bulkheads
and
compartments
to
the
great
eastern
type
in
order
to
include
the
risk
of
iceberg
collision
and
loss
here
comes
in
the
question
of
increased
cost
of
construction
and
in
addition
the
great
loss
of
space
with
decreased
earning
capacity
both
of
which
will
mean
an
increase
in
the
passenger
rates
this
the
travelling
public
will
have
to
face
and
undoubtedly
will
be
willing
to
face
for
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
what
was
so
confidently
affirmed
by
passengers
on
the
titanic
deck
that
night
of
the
collision
will
then
be
really
true
that
we
are
on
an
unsinkable
boat
so
far
as
human
forethought
can
devise
after
all
this
be
the
solution
to
the
problem
how
best
to
ensure
safety
at
sea
other
safety
appliances
are
useful
and
necessary
but
not
useable
in
certain
conditions
of
weather
the
ship
itself
must
always
be
the
safety
appliance
that
is
really
trustworthy
and
nothing
must
be
left
undone
to
ensure
this
apparatus
and
the
range
of
the
apparatus
might
well
be
extended
but
the
principal
defect
is
the
lack
of
an
operator
for
night
duty
on
some
ships
the
awful
fact
that
the
californian
lay
a
few
miles
away
able
to
save
every
soul
on
board
and
could
not
catch
the
message
because
the
operator
was
asleep
seems
too
cruel
to
dwell
upon
even
on
the
carpathia
the
operator
was
on
the
point
of
retiring
when
the
message
arrived
and
we
should
have
been
much
longer
afloat
and
some
boats
possibly
swamped
had
he
not
caught
the
message
when
he
did
it
has
been
suggested
that
officers
should
have
a
working
knowledge
of
wireless
telegraphy
and
this
is
no
doubt
a
wise
provision
it
would
enable
them
to
supervise
the
work
of
the
operators
more
closely
and
from
all
the
evidence
this
seems
a
necessity
the
exchange
of
vitally
important
messages
between
a
sinking
ship
and
those
rushing
to
her
rescue
should
be
under
the
control
of
an
experienced
officer
to
take
but
one
example
bride
testified
that
after
giving
the
birma
the
message
and
the
position
incidentally
signer
marconi
has
stated
that
this
has
been
abandoned
in
favour
of
and
getting
a
reply
they
got
into
touch
with
the
carpathia
and
while
talking
with
her
were
interrupted
by
the
birma
asking
what
was
the
matter
no
doubt
it
was
the
duty
of
the
birma
to
come
at
once
without
asking
any
questions
but
the
reply
from
the
titanic
telling
the
operator
not
to
be
a
fool
by
interrupting
seems
to
have
been
a
needless
waste
of
precious
moments
to
reply
we
are
sinking
would
have
taken
no
longer
especially
when
in
their
own
estimation
of
the
strength
of
the
signals
they
thought
the
birma
was
the
nearer
ship
it
is
well
to
notice
that
some
large
liners
have
already
a
staff
of
three
operators
signalling
there
are
occasions
when
wireless
apparatus
is
useless
as
a
means
of
saving
life
at
sea
promptly
one
of
its
weaknesses
is
that
when
the
ships
engines
are
stopped
messages
can
no
longer
be
sent
out
that
is
with
the
system
at
present
adopted
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
titanic
messages
got
gradually
fainter
and
then
ceased
altogether
as
she
came
to
rest
with
her
engines
shut
down
again
in
fogs
and
most
accidents
occur
in
fogs
while
wireless
informs
of
the
accident
it
does
not
enable
one
ship
to
locate
another
closely
enough
to
take
off
her
passengers
at
once
there
is
as
yet
no
method
known
by
which
wireless
telegraphy
will
fix
the
direction
of
a
message
and
after
a
ship
has
been
in
fog
for
any
considerable
length
of
time
it
is
more
difficult
to
give
the
exact
position
to
another
vessel
bringing
help
nothing
could
illustrate
these
two
points
better
than
the
story
of
how
the
baltic
found
the
republic
in
the
year
in
a
dense
fog
off
nantucket
lightship
when
the
latter
was
drifting
helplessly
after
collision
with
the
florida
the
baltic
received
a
wireless
message
stating
the
republic
condition
and
the
information
that
she
was
in
touch
with
nantucket
through
a
submarine
bell
which
she
could
hear
ringing
the
baltic
turned
and
went
towards
the
position
in
the
fog
picked
up
the
submarine
from
nantucket
and
then
began
searching
near
this
position
for
the
republic
it
took
her
twelve
hours
to
find
the
damaged
ship
zigzagging
across
a
circle
within
which
she
thought
the
republic
might
lie
in
a
rough
sea
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
republic
would
have
remained
afloat
long
enough
for
the
baltic
to
find
her
and
take
off
all
her
passengers
now
on
these
two
occasions
when
wireless
telegraphy
was
found
to
be
unreliable
the
usefulness
of
the
submarine
bell
at
once
becomes
apparent
the
baltic
could
have
gone
unerringly
to
the
republic
in
the
dense
fog
had
the
latter
been
fitted
with
a
submarine
emergency
bell
it
will
perhaps
be
well
to
spend
a
little
time
describing
the
submarine
signalling
apparatus
to
see
how
this
result
could
have
been
obtained
twelve
anxious
hours
in
a
dense
fog
on
a
ship
which
was
injured
so
badly
that
she
subsequently
foundered
is
an
experience
which
every
appliance
known
to
human
invention
should
be
enlisted
to
prevent
submarine
signalling
has
never
received
that
public
notice
which
wireless
telegraphy
has
for
the
reason
that
it
does
not
appeal
so
readily
to
the
popular
mind
that
it
is
an
absolute
necessity
to
every
ship
carrying
passengers
or
carrying
anything
for
that
matter
is
beyond
question
it
is
an
additional
safeguard
that
no
ship
can
afford
to
be
without
there
are
many
occasions
when
the
atmosphere
fails
lamentably
as
a
medium
for
carrying
messages
when
fog
falls
down
as
it
does
sometimes
in
a
moment
on
the
hundreds
of
ships
coasting
down
the
traffic
ways
round
our
shores
ways
which
are
defined
so
easily
in
clear
weather
and
with
such
difficulty
in
fogs
the
hundreds
of
lighthouses
and
lightships
which
serve
as
warning
beacons
and
on
which
many
millions
of
money
have
been
spent
are
for
all
practical
purposes
as
useless
to
the
navigator
as
if
they
had
never
been
built
he
is
just
as
helpless
as
if
he
were
back
in
the
years
before
when
trinity
house
was
granted
a
charter
by
henry
viii
for
the
relief
of
the
shipping
of
this
realm
of
england
and
began
a
system
of
lights
on
the
shores
of
which
the
present
chain
of
lighthouses
and
lightships
is
the
outcome
nor
is
the
foghorn
much
better
the
presence
of
different
layers
of
fog
and
air
and
their
varying
densities
which
cause
both
reflection
and
refraction
of
sound
prevent
the
air
from
being
a
reliable
medium
for
carrying
it
now
submarine
signalling
has
none
of
these
defects
for
the
medium
is
water
subject
to
no
such
variable
conditions
as
the
air
its
density
is
practically
non
variable
and
sound
travels
through
it
at
the
rate
of
feet
per
second
without
deviation
or
reflection
the
apparatus
consists
of
a
bell
designed
to
ring
either
pneumatically
from
a
lightship
electrically
from
the
shore
the
bell
itself
being
a
tripod
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
automatically
from
a
floating
or
by
hand
from
a
ship
or
boat
the
sound
travels
from
the
bell
in
every
direction
like
waves
in
a
pond
and
falls
it
may
be
on
the
side
of
a
ship
the
receiving
apparatus
is
fixed
inside
the
skin
of
the
ship
and
consists
of
a
small
iron
tank
inches
square
and
inches
deep
the
front
of
the
tank
facing
the
ship
iron
skin
is
missing
and
the
tank
being
filled
with
water
is
bolted
to
the
framework
and
sealed
firmly
to
the
ship
side
by
rubber
facing
in
this
way
a
portion
of
the
ship
iron
hull
is
washed
by
the
sea
on
one
side
and
water
in
the
tank
on
the
other
vibrations
from
a
bell
ringing
at
a
distance
fall
on
the
iron
side
travel
through
and
strike
on
two
microphones
hanging
in
the
tank
these
microphones
transmit
the
sound
along
wires
to
the
chart
room
where
telephones
convey
the
message
to
the
officer
on
duty
there
are
two
of
these
tanks
or
receivers
fitted
against
the
side
one
on
the
port
and
one
on
the
starboard
side
near
the
bows
and
as
far
down
below
the
water
level
as
is
possible
the
direction
of
sounds
coming
to
the
microphones
hanging
in
these
tanks
can
be
estimated
by
switching
alternately
to
the
port
and
starboard
tanks
if
the
sound
is
of
greater
intensity
on
the
port
side
then
the
bell
signalling
is
off
the
port
bows
and
similarly
on
the
starboard
side
the
ship
is
turned
towards
the
sound
until
the
same
volume
of
sound
is
heard
from
both
receivers
when
the
bell
is
known
to
be
dead
ahead
so
accurate
is
this
in
practice
that
a
trained
operator
can
steer
his
ship
in
the
densest
fog
directly
to
a
lightship
or
any
other
point
where
a
submarine
bell
is
sending
its
warning
beneath
the
sea
it
must
be
repeated
that
the
medium
in
which
these
signals
are
transmitted
is
a
constant
one
not
subject
to
any
of
the
limitations
and
variations
imposed
on
the
atmosphere
and
the
ether
as
media
for
the
transmission
of
light
blasts
of
a
foghorn
and
wireless
vibrations
at
present
the
chief
use
of
submarine
signalling
is
from
the
shore
or
a
lightship
to
ships
at
sea
and
not
from
ship
to
ship
or
from
ship
to
the
shore
in
other
words
ships
carry
only
receiving
apparatus
and
lighthouses
and
lightships
use
only
signalling
apparatus
some
of
the
lighthouses
and
lightships
on
our
coasts
already
have
these
submarine
bells
in
addition
to
their
lights
and
in
bad
weather
the
bells
send
out
their
messages
to
warn
ships
of
their
proximity
to
a
danger
point
this
invention
enables
ships
to
pick
up
the
sound
of
bell
after
bell
on
a
coast
and
run
along
it
in
the
densest
fog
almost
as
well
as
in
daylight
passenger
steamers
coming
into
port
do
not
have
to
wander
about
in
the
fog
groping
their
way
blindly
into
harbour
by
having
a
code
of
rings
and
judging
by
the
intensity
of
the
sound
it
is
possible
to
tell
almost
exactly
where
a
ship
is
in
relation
to
the
coast
or
to
some
lightship
the
british
admiralty
report
in
said
if
the
lightships
round
the
coast
were
fitted
with
submarine
bells
it
would
be
possible
for
ships
fitted
with
receiving
apparatus
to
navigate
in
fog
with
almost
as
great
certainty
as
in
clear
weather
and
the
following
remark
of
a
captain
engaged
in
coast
service
is
instructive
he
had
been
asked
to
cut
down
expenses
by
omitting
the
submarine
signalling
apparatus
but
replied
i
would
rather
take
out
the
wireless
that
only
enables
me
to
tell
other
people
where
i
am
the
submarine
signal
enables
me
to
find
out
where
i
am
myself
the
range
of
the
apparatus
is
not
so
wide
as
that
of
wireless
telegraphy
varying
from
to
miles
for
a
large
ship
although
instances
of
to
are
on
record
and
from
to
miles
for
a
small
ship
at
present
the
receiving
apparatus
is
fixed
on
only
some
steamers
of
the
merchant
marine
these
being
mostly
the
passenger
liners
there
is
no
question
that
it
should
be
installed
along
with
wireless
apparatus
on
every
ship
of
over
tons
gross
tonnage
equally
important
is
the
provision
of
signalling
apparatus
on
board
ships
it
is
obviously
just
as
necessary
to
transmit
a
signal
as
to
receive
one
but
at
present
the
sending
of
signals
from
ships
has
not
been
perfected
the
invention
of
apparatus
to
be
used
while
the
ship
is
under
way
is
as
yet
in
the
experimental
stage
but
while
she
is
at
rest
a
bell
similar
to
those
used
by
lighthouses
can
be
sunk
over
her
side
and
rung
by
hand
with
exactly
the
same
effect
but
liners
are
not
provided
with
them
they
cost
only
pounds
as
mentioned
before
with
another
pounds
spent
on
the
equipment
the
baltic
could
have
picked
up
her
bell
and
steered
direct
to
her
just
as
they
both
heard
the
bell
of
nantucket
lightship
again
if
the
titanic
had
been
provided
with
a
bell
and
the
californian
with
receiving
apparatus
neither
of
them
was
the
officer
on
the
bridge
could
have
heard
the
signals
from
the
telephones
near
a
smaller
size
for
use
in
lifeboats
is
provided
and
would
be
heard
by
receiving
apparatus
for
approximately
five
miles
if
we
had
hung
one
of
these
bells
over
the
side
of
the
lifeboats
afloat
that
night
we
should
have
been
free
from
the
anxiety
of
being
run
down
as
we
lay
across
the
carpathia
path
without
a
light
or
if
we
had
gone
adrift
in
a
dense
fog
and
wandered
miles
apart
from
each
other
on
the
sea
as
we
inevitably
should
have
done
the
carpathia
could
still
have
picked
up
each
boat
individually
by
means
of
the
bell
signal
in
those
ships
fitted
with
receiving
apparatus
at
least
one
officer
is
obliged
to
understand
the
working
of
the
apparatus
a
very
wise
precaution
and
as
suggested
above
one
that
should
be
taken
with
respect
to
wireless
apparatus
also
it
was
a
very
great
pleasure
to
me
to
see
all
this
apparatus
in
manufacture
and
in
use
at
one
of
the
principal
submarine
signalling
works
in
america
and
to
hear
some
of
the
remarkable
stories
of
its
value
in
actual
practice
i
was
struck
by
the
aptness
of
the
motto
adopted
by
them
de
profundis
clamavi
in
relation
to
the
end
and
the
calls
of
our
passengers
from
the
sea
when
she
sank
out
of
the
deep
have
i
called
unto
thee
is
indeed
a
suitable
motto
for
those
who
are
doing
all
they
can
to
prevent
such
calls
arising
from
their
fellow
men
and
women
out
of
the
deep
of
steamship
the
lanes
along
which
the
liners
travel
are
fixed
by
agreement
among
the
steamship
companies
in
consultation
with
the
hydrographic
departments
of
the
different
countries
these
routes
are
arranged
so
that
steamers
are
always
a
number
of
miles
away
from
those
going
west
and
thus
the
danger
of
collision
between
east
and
vessels
is
entirely
eliminated
the
lanes
can
be
moved
farther
south
if
icebergs
threaten
and
north
again
when
the
danger
is
removed
of
course
the
farther
south
they
are
placed
the
longer
the
journey
to
be
made
and
the
longer
the
time
spent
on
board
with
consequent
grumbling
by
some
passengers
for
example
the
lanes
since
the
disaster
to
the
titanic
have
been
moved
one
hundred
miles
farther
south
which
means
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
longer
journey
taking
eight
hours
the
only
real
precaution
against
colliding
with
icebergs
is
to
go
south
of
the
place
where
they
are
likely
to
be
there
is
no
other
way
the
provision
was
of
course
woefully
inadequate
the
only
humane
plan
is
to
have
a
numbered
seat
in
a
boat
assigned
to
each
passenger
and
member
of
the
crew
it
would
seem
well
to
have
this
number
pointed
out
at
the
time
of
booking
a
berth
and
to
have
a
plan
in
each
cabin
showing
where
the
boat
is
and
how
to
get
to
it
the
most
direct
way
a
most
important
consideration
with
a
ship
like
the
titanic
with
over
two
miles
of
deck
space
of
the
passengers
and
crew
of
each
boat
should
be
held
under
compulsion
as
soon
as
possible
after
leaving
port
i
asked
an
officer
as
to
the
possibility
of
having
such
a
drill
immediately
after
the
gangways
are
withdrawn
and
before
the
tugs
are
allowed
to
haul
the
ship
out
of
dock
but
he
says
the
difficulties
are
almost
insuperable
at
such
a
time
if
so
the
drill
should
be
conducted
in
sections
as
soon
as
possible
after
sailing
and
should
be
conducted
in
a
thorough
manner
children
in
school
are
called
upon
suddenly
to
go
through
and
there
is
no
reason
why
passengers
on
board
ship
should
not
be
similarly
trained
so
much
depends
on
order
and
readiness
in
time
of
danger
undoubtedly
the
whole
subject
of
manning
provisioning
loading
and
lowering
of
lifeboats
should
be
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
officer
who
should
have
no
other
duties
the
modern
liner
has
become
far
too
big
to
permit
the
captain
to
exercise
control
over
the
whole
ship
and
all
vitally
important
subdivisions
should
be
controlled
by
a
separate
authority
it
seems
a
piece
of
bitter
irony
to
remember
that
on
the
titanic
a
special
chef
was
engaged
at
a
large
salary
larger
perhaps
than
that
of
any
officer
and
no
boatmaster
or
some
such
officer
was
considered
necessary
the
general
system
again
not
criminal
neglect
as
some
hasty
criticisms
would
say
but
lack
of
consideration
for
our
the
placing
of
luxurious
attractions
above
that
kindly
forethought
that
allows
no
precaution
to
be
neglected
for
even
the
humblest
passenger
but
it
must
not
be
overlooked
that
the
provision
of
sufficient
lifeboats
on
deck
is
not
evidence
they
will
all
be
launched
easily
or
all
the
passengers
taken
off
safely
it
must
be
remembered
that
ideal
conditions
prevailed
that
night
for
launching
boats
from
the
decks
of
the
titanic
there
was
no
list
that
prevented
the
boats
getting
away
they
could
be
launched
on
both
sides
and
when
they
were
lowered
the
sea
was
so
calm
that
they
pulled
away
without
any
of
the
smashing
against
the
side
that
is
possible
in
rough
seas
sometimes
it
would
mean
that
only
those
boats
on
the
side
sheltered
from
a
heavy
sea
could
ever
get
away
and
this
would
at
once
halve
the
boat
accommodation
and
when
launched
there
would
be
the
danger
of
swamping
in
such
a
heavy
sea
all
things
considered
lifeboats
might
be
the
poorest
sort
of
safeguard
in
certain
conditions
are
said
to
be
much
inferior
to
lifeboats
in
a
rough
sea
and
collapsible
boats
made
of
canvas
and
thin
wood
soon
decay
under
exposure
to
weather
and
are
at
a
critical
moment
some
of
the
lifeboats
should
be
provided
with
motors
to
keep
the
boats
together
and
to
tow
if
necessary
the
launching
is
an
important
matter
the
titanic
davits
worked
excellently
and
no
doubt
were
largely
responsible
for
all
the
boats
getting
away
safely
they
were
far
superior
to
those
on
most
liners
after
the
sinking
of
the
bourgogne
when
two
americans
lost
their
lives
a
prize
of
pounds
was
offered
by
their
heirs
for
the
best
device
applicable
to
ships
at
sea
a
board
sat
to
consider
the
various
appliances
sent
in
by
competitors
and
finally
awarded
the
prize
to
an
englishman
whose
design
provided
for
a
flat
structure
the
width
of
the
ship
which
could
be
floated
off
when
required
and
would
accommodate
several
hundred
passengers
it
has
never
been
adopted
by
any
steamship
line
other
similar
designs
are
known
by
which
the
whole
of
the
after
deck
can
be
pushed
over
from
the
stern
by
a
ratchet
arrangement
with
below
to
buoy
it
up
it
seems
to
be
a
practical
suggestion
one
point
where
the
titanic
management
failed
lamentably
was
to
provide
a
properly
trained
crew
to
each
lifeboat
the
rowing
was
in
most
cases
execrable
there
is
no
more
reason
why
a
steward
should
be
able
to
row
than
a
passenger
less
so
than
some
of
the
passengers
who
were
lost
men
of
leisure
accustomed
to
all
kinds
of
sport
including
rowing
and
in
addition
probably
more
fit
physically
than
a
steward
to
row
for
hours
on
the
open
sea
and
if
a
steward
can
not
row
he
has
no
right
to
be
at
an
oar
so
that
under
the
unwritten
rule
that
passengers
take
precedence
of
the
crew
when
there
is
not
sufficient
accommodation
for
all
a
situation
that
should
never
be
allowed
to
arise
again
for
a
member
of
the
crew
should
have
an
equal
opportunity
with
a
passenger
to
save
his
life
the
majority
of
stewards
and
cooks
should
have
stayed
behind
and
passengers
have
come
instead
they
could
not
have
been
of
less
use
and
they
might
have
been
of
more
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
proportion
of
crew
saved
to
passengers
was
to
a
high
proportion
another
point
arises
out
of
these
figures
deduct
members
of
the
crew
who
were
stewardesses
and
men
of
the
crew
are
left
as
against
the
passengers
of
these
some
got
on
the
overturned
collapsible
boat
after
the
titanic
sank
and
a
few
were
picked
up
by
the
lifeboats
but
these
were
not
many
in
all
now
with
the
boats
brought
to
the
carpathia
and
an
average
of
six
of
the
crew
to
man
each
boat
probably
a
higher
average
than
was
realized
we
get
a
total
of
who
should
have
been
saved
as
against
who
actually
were
there
were
as
is
known
stokers
and
stewards
in
the
boats
who
were
not
members
of
the
lifeboats
crews
it
may
seem
heartless
to
analyze
figures
in
this
way
and
suggest
that
some
of
the
crew
who
got
to
the
carpathia
never
should
have
done
so
but
after
all
passengers
took
their
passage
under
certain
rules
written
and
unwritten
and
one
is
that
in
times
of
danger
the
servants
of
the
company
in
whose
boats
they
sail
shall
first
of
all
see
to
the
safety
of
the
passengers
before
thinking
of
their
own
there
were
only
men
passengers
saved
as
against
of
the
crew
and
men
lost
as
against
of
the
crew
so
that
actually
the
crew
had
a
greater
percentage
saved
than
the
men
passengers
per
cent
against
but
steamship
companies
are
faced
with
real
difficulties
in
this
matter
the
crews
are
never
the
same
for
two
voyages
together
they
sign
on
for
the
one
trip
then
perhaps
take
a
berth
on
shore
as
waiters
stokers
in
hotel
to
resume
life
on
board
any
other
ship
that
is
handy
when
the
desire
comes
to
go
to
sea
again
they
can
in
no
sense
be
regarded
as
part
of
a
homogeneous
crew
subject
to
regular
discipline
and
educated
to
appreciate
the
morale
of
a
particular
liner
as
a
man
of
war
crew
is
these
seem
an
absolute
necessity
and
the
wonder
is
that
they
have
not
been
fitted
before
to
all
ocean
liners
not
only
are
they
of
use
in
lighting
up
the
sea
a
long
distance
ahead
but
as
flashlight
signals
they
permit
of
communication
with
other
ships
as
i
write
through
the
window
can
be
seen
the
flashes
from
river
steamers
plying
up
the
hudson
in
new
york
each
with
its
searchlight
examining
the
river
lighting
up
the
bank
for
hundreds
of
yards
ahead
and
bringing
every
object
within
its
reach
into
prominence
they
are
regularly
used
too
in
the
suez
canal
i
suppose
there
is
no
question
that
the
collision
would
have
been
avoided
had
a
searchlight
been
fitted
to
the
titanic
masthead
the
climatic
conditions
for
its
use
must
have
been
ideal
that
night
there
are
other
things
besides
icebergs
derelicts
are
reported
from
time
to
time
and
fishermen
lie
in
the
lanes
without
lights
they
would
not
always
be
of
practical
use
however
they
would
be
of
no
service
in
heavy
rain
in
fog
in
snow
or
in
flying
spray
and
the
effect
is
sometimes
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
lookout
while
writing
of
the
lookout
much
has
been
made
of
the
omission
to
provide
the
lookout
on
the
titanic
with
glasses
the
general
opinion
of
officers
seems
to
be
that
it
is
better
not
to
provide
them
but
to
rely
on
good
eyesight
and
men
after
all
in
a
question
of
actual
practice
the
opinion
of
officers
should
be
accepted
as
final
even
if
it
seems
to
the
landsman
the
better
thing
to
provide
glasses
one
or
two
internationally
owned
and
controlled
lightships
fitted
with
every
known
device
for
signalling
and
communication
would
rob
those
regions
of
most
of
their
terrors
they
could
watch
and
chart
the
icebergs
report
their
exact
position
the
amount
and
direction
of
daily
drift
in
the
changing
currents
that
are
found
there
to
them
too
might
be
entrusted
the
duty
of
police
patrol
chapter
ix
some
impressions
no
one
can
pass
through
an
event
like
the
wreck
of
the
titanic
without
recording
mentally
many
impressions
deep
and
vivid
of
what
has
been
seen
and
felt
in
so
far
as
such
impressions
are
of
benefit
to
mankind
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
and
this
chapter
is
an
attempt
to
picture
how
people
thought
and
felt
from
the
time
they
first
heard
of
the
disaster
to
the
landing
in
new
york
when
there
was
opportunity
to
judge
of
events
somewhat
from
a
distance
while
it
is
to
some
extent
a
personal
record
the
mental
impressions
of
other
survivors
have
been
compared
and
found
to
be
in
many
cases
closely
in
agreement
naturally
it
is
very
imperfect
and
pretends
to
be
no
more
than
a
sketch
of
the
way
people
act
under
the
influence
of
strong
emotions
produced
by
imminent
danger
in
the
first
place
the
principal
fact
that
stands
out
is
the
almost
entire
absence
of
any
expressions
of
fear
or
alarm
on
the
part
of
passengers
and
the
conformity
to
the
normal
on
the
part
of
almost
everyone
i
think
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
those
who
read
of
the
disaster
quietly
at
home
and
pictured
to
themselves
the
scene
as
the
titanic
was
sinking
had
more
of
the
sense
of
horror
than
those
who
stood
on
the
deck
and
watched
her
go
down
inch
by
inch
the
fact
is
that
the
sense
of
fear
came
to
the
passengers
very
slowly
a
result
of
the
absence
of
any
signs
of
danger
and
the
peaceful
night
and
as
it
became
evident
gradually
that
there
was
serious
damage
to
the
ship
the
fear
that
came
with
the
knowledge
was
largely
destroyed
as
it
came
there
was
no
sudden
overwhelming
sense
of
danger
that
passed
through
thought
so
quickly
that
it
was
difficult
to
catch
up
and
grapple
with
it
no
need
for
the
warning
to
be
not
afraid
of
sudden
fear
such
as
might
have
been
present
had
we
collided
with
a
crash
and
a
shock
that
flung
everyone
out
of
his
bunk
to
the
floor
everyone
had
time
to
give
each
condition
of
danger
attention
as
it
came
along
and
the
result
of
their
judgment
was
as
if
they
had
said
well
here
is
this
thing
to
be
faced
and
we
must
see
it
through
as
quietly
as
we
can
quietness
and
were
undoubtedly
the
two
qualities
most
expressed
there
were
times
when
danger
loomed
more
nearly
and
there
was
temporarily
some
excitement
for
example
when
the
first
rocket
went
up
but
after
the
first
realization
of
what
it
meant
the
crowd
took
hold
of
the
situation
and
soon
gained
the
same
quiet
control
that
was
evident
at
first
as
the
sense
of
fear
ebbed
and
flowed
it
was
so
obviously
a
thing
within
one
own
power
to
control
that
quite
unconsciously
realizing
the
absolute
necessity
of
keeping
cool
every
one
for
his
own
safety
put
away
the
thought
of
danger
as
far
as
was
possible
then
too
the
curious
sense
of
the
whole
thing
being
a
dream
was
very
prominent
that
all
were
looking
on
at
the
scene
from
a
vantage
point
in
a
position
of
perfect
safety
and
that
those
who
walked
the
decks
or
tied
one
lifebelts
on
were
the
actors
in
a
scene
of
which
we
were
but
spectators
that
the
dream
would
end
soon
and
we
should
wake
up
to
find
the
scene
had
vanished
many
people
have
had
a
similar
experience
in
times
of
danger
but
it
was
very
noticeable
standing
on
the
titanic
deck
i
remember
observing
it
particularly
while
tying
on
a
lifebelt
for
a
man
on
the
deck
it
is
fortunate
that
it
should
be
so
to
be
able
to
survey
such
a
scene
dispassionately
is
a
wonderful
aid
inn
the
destruction
of
the
fear
that
go
with
it
one
thing
that
helped
considerably
to
establish
this
orderly
condition
of
affairs
was
the
quietness
of
the
surroundings
it
may
seem
weariness
to
refer
again
to
this
but
i
am
convinced
it
had
much
to
do
with
keeping
everyone
calm
the
ship
was
motionless
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
sky
was
clear
the
sea
like
a
the
general
atmosphere
was
peaceful
and
all
on
board
responded
unconsciously
to
it
but
what
controlled
the
situation
principally
was
the
quality
of
obedience
and
respect
for
authority
which
is
a
dominant
characteristic
of
the
teutonic
race
passengers
did
as
they
were
told
by
the
officers
in
charge
women
went
to
the
decks
below
men
remained
where
they
were
told
and
waited
in
silence
for
the
next
order
knowing
instinctively
that
this
was
the
only
way
to
bring
about
the
best
result
for
all
on
board
the
officers
in
their
turn
carried
out
the
work
assigned
to
them
by
their
superior
officers
as
quickly
and
orderly
as
circumstances
permitted
the
senior
ones
being
in
control
of
the
manning
filling
and
lowering
of
the
lifeboats
while
the
junior
officers
were
lowered
in
individual
boats
to
take
command
of
the
fleet
adrift
on
the
sea
similarly
the
engineers
below
the
band
the
gymnasium
instructor
were
all
performing
their
tasks
as
they
came
along
orderly
quietly
without
question
or
stopping
to
consider
what
was
their
chance
of
safety
this
correlation
on
the
part
of
passengers
officers
and
crew
was
simply
obedience
to
duty
and
it
was
innate
rather
than
the
product
of
reasoned
judgment
i
hope
it
will
not
seem
to
detract
in
any
way
from
the
heroism
of
those
who
faced
the
last
plunge
of
the
titanic
so
courageously
when
all
the
boats
had
gone
if
it
does
it
is
the
difficulty
of
expressing
an
idea
in
adequate
words
to
say
that
their
quiet
heroism
was
largely
unconscious
temperamental
not
a
definite
choice
between
two
ways
of
acting
all
that
was
visible
on
deck
before
the
boats
left
tended
to
this
conclusion
and
the
testimony
of
those
who
went
down
with
the
ship
and
were
afterwards
rescued
is
of
the
same
kind
certainly
it
seems
to
express
much
more
general
nobility
of
character
in
a
race
of
people
consisting
of
different
nationalities
to
find
heroism
an
unconscious
quality
of
the
race
than
to
have
it
arising
as
an
effort
of
will
to
have
to
bring
it
out
consciously
it
is
unfortunate
that
some
sections
of
the
press
should
seek
to
chronicle
mainly
the
individual
acts
of
heroism
the
collective
behaviour
of
a
crowd
is
of
so
much
more
importance
to
the
world
and
so
much
more
a
test
if
a
test
be
wanted
of
how
a
race
of
people
behaves
the
attempt
to
record
the
acts
of
individuals
leads
apparently
to
such
false
reports
as
that
of
major
butt
holding
at
bay
with
a
revolver
a
crowd
of
passengers
and
shooting
them
down
as
they
tried
to
rush
the
boats
or
of
captain
smith
shouting
be
british
through
a
megaphone
and
subsequently
committing
suicide
along
with
first
officer
murdock
it
is
only
a
morbid
sense
of
things
that
would
describe
such
incidents
as
heroic
everyone
knows
that
major
butt
was
a
brave
man
but
his
record
of
heroism
would
not
be
enhanced
if
he
a
trained
army
officer
were
compelled
under
orders
from
the
captain
to
shoot
down
unarmed
passengers
it
might
in
other
conditions
have
been
necessary
but
it
would
not
be
heroic
similarly
there
could
be
nothing
heroic
in
captain
smith
or
murdock
putting
an
end
to
their
lives
it
is
conceivable
men
might
be
so
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
disaster
that
they
knew
not
how
they
were
acting
but
to
be
really
heroic
would
have
been
to
stop
with
the
ship
as
of
course
they
did
with
the
hope
of
being
picked
up
along
with
passengers
and
crew
and
returning
to
face
an
enquiry
and
to
give
evidence
that
would
be
of
supreme
value
to
the
whole
world
for
the
prevention
of
similar
disasters
it
was
not
possible
but
if
heroism
consists
in
doing
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
number
it
would
have
been
heroic
for
both
officers
to
to
be
saved
we
do
not
know
what
they
thought
but
i
for
one
like
to
imagine
that
they
did
so
second
officer
lightoller
worked
steadily
at
the
boats
until
the
last
possible
moment
went
down
with
the
ship
was
saved
in
what
seemed
a
miraculous
manner
and
returned
to
give
valuable
evidence
before
the
commissions
of
two
countries
the
second
thing
that
stands
out
prominently
in
the
emotions
produced
by
the
disaster
is
that
in
moments
of
urgent
need
men
and
women
turn
for
help
to
something
entirely
outside
themselves
i
remember
reading
some
years
ago
a
story
of
an
atheist
who
was
the
guest
at
dinner
of
a
regimental
mess
in
india
the
colonel
listened
to
his
remarks
on
atheism
in
silence
and
invited
him
for
a
drive
the
following
morning
he
took
his
guest
up
a
rough
mountain
road
in
a
light
carriage
drawn
by
two
ponies
and
when
some
distance
from
the
plain
below
turned
the
carriage
round
and
allowed
the
ponies
to
run
away
as
it
seemed
downhill
in
the
terror
of
approaching
disaster
the
atheist
was
lifted
out
of
his
reasoned
convictions
and
prayed
aloud
for
help
when
the
colonel
reined
in
his
ponies
and
with
the
remark
that
the
whole
drive
had
been
planned
with
the
intention
of
proving
to
his
guest
that
there
was
a
power
outside
his
own
reason
descended
quietly
to
level
ground
the
story
may
or
may
not
be
true
and
in
any
case
is
not
introduced
as
an
attack
on
atheism
but
it
illustrates
in
a
striking
way
the
frailty
of
dependence
on
a
man
own
power
and
resource
in
imminent
danger
to
those
men
standing
on
the
top
deck
with
the
boats
all
lowered
and
still
more
so
when
the
boats
had
all
left
there
came
the
realization
that
human
resources
were
exhausted
and
human
avenues
of
escape
closed
with
it
came
the
appeal
to
whatever
consciousness
each
had
of
a
power
that
had
created
the
universe
after
all
some
power
had
made
the
brilliant
stars
above
countless
millions
of
miles
away
moving
in
definite
order
formed
on
a
definite
plan
and
obeying
a
definite
law
had
made
each
one
of
the
passengers
with
ability
to
think
and
act
with
the
best
proof
after
all
of
being
created
the
knowledge
of
their
own
existence
and
now
if
at
any
time
was
the
time
to
appeal
to
that
power
when
the
boats
had
left
and
it
was
seen
the
ship
was
going
down
rapidly
men
stood
in
groups
on
the
deck
engaged
in
prayer
and
later
as
some
of
them
lay
on
the
overturned
collapsible
boat
they
repeated
together
over
and
over
again
the
prayer
irrespective
of
religious
beliefs
some
perhaps
without
religious
beliefs
united
in
a
common
appeal
for
deliverance
from
their
surroundings
and
this
was
not
because
it
was
a
habit
because
they
had
learned
this
prayer
at
their
mother
knee
men
do
not
do
such
things
through
habit
it
must
have
been
because
each
one
saw
removed
the
thousand
and
one
ways
in
which
he
had
relied
on
human
material
things
to
help
him
including
even
dependence
on
the
overturned
boat
with
its
bubble
of
air
inside
which
any
moment
a
rising
swell
might
remove
as
it
tilted
the
boat
too
far
sideways
and
sink
the
boat
below
the
surface
saw
laid
bare
his
utter
dependence
on
something
that
had
made
him
and
given
him
power
to
think
whether
he
named
it
god
or
divine
power
or
first
cause
or
creator
or
named
it
not
at
all
but
recognized
it
unconsciously
saw
these
things
and
expressed
them
in
the
form
of
words
he
was
best
acquainted
with
in
common
with
his
he
did
so
not
through
a
sense
of
duty
to
his
particular
religion
not
because
he
had
learned
the
words
but
because
he
recognized
that
it
was
the
most
practical
thing
to
do
the
thing
best
fitted
to
help
him
men
do
practical
things
in
times
like
that
they
would
not
waste
a
moment
on
mere
words
if
those
words
were
not
an
expression
of
the
most
intensely
real
conviction
of
which
they
were
capable
again
like
the
feeling
of
heroism
this
appeal
is
innate
and
intuitive
and
it
certainly
has
its
foundation
on
a
knowledge
largely
concealed
no
doubt
of
immortality
i
think
this
must
be
obvious
there
could
be
no
other
explanation
of
such
a
general
sinking
of
all
the
emotions
of
the
human
mind
expressed
in
a
thousand
different
ways
by
a
thousand
different
people
in
favour
of
this
single
appeal
the
behaviour
of
people
during
the
hours
in
the
lifeboats
the
landing
on
the
carpathia
the
life
there
and
the
landing
in
new
york
can
all
be
summarized
by
saying
that
people
did
not
act
at
all
as
they
were
expected
to
act
or
rather
as
most
people
expected
they
would
act
and
in
some
cases
have
erroneously
said
they
did
act
events
were
there
to
be
faced
and
not
to
crush
people
down
situations
arose
which
demanded
courage
resource
and
in
the
cases
of
those
who
had
lost
friends
most
dear
to
them
enormous
but
very
wonderfully
they
responded
there
was
the
same
quiet
demeanour
and
poise
the
same
inborn
dominion
over
circumstances
the
same
conformity
to
a
normal
standard
which
characterized
the
crowd
of
passengers
on
the
deck
of
the
titanic
and
for
the
same
reasons
the
first
two
or
three
days
ashore
were
undoubtedly
rather
trying
to
some
of
the
survivors
it
seemed
as
if
coming
into
the
world
again
the
four
days
shut
off
from
any
news
seemed
a
long
time
and
finding
what
a
shock
the
disaster
had
produced
the
flags
the
staring
the
sense
of
gloom
noticeable
everywhere
made
things
worse
than
they
had
been
on
the
carpathia
the
difference
in
atmosphere
was
very
marked
and
people
gave
way
to
some
extent
under
it
and
felt
the
reaction
gratitude
for
their
deliverance
and
a
desire
to
make
the
best
of
things
must
have
helped
soon
however
to
restore
them
to
normal
conditions
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
some
survivors
felt
quieter
on
the
carpathia
with
its
lack
of
news
from
the
outside
world
if
the
following
extract
from
a
leading
new
york
evening
paper
was
some
of
the
material
of
which
the
atmosphere
on
shore
was
composed
stunned
by
the
terrific
impact
the
dazed
passengers
rushed
from
their
staterooms
into
the
main
saloon
amid
the
crash
of
splintering
steel
rending
of
plates
and
shattering
of
girders
while
the
boom
of
falling
pinnacles
of
ice
upon
the
broken
deck
of
the
great
vessel
added
to
the
horror
in
a
wild
ungovernable
mob
they
poured
out
of
the
saloons
to
witness
one
of
the
most
appalling
scenes
possible
to
conceive
for
a
hundred
feet
the
bow
was
a
shapeless
mass
of
bent
broken
and
splintered
steel
and
iron
and
so
on
horror
piled
on
horror
and
not
a
word
of
it
true
or
remotely
approaching
the
truth
this
paper
was
selling
in
the
streets
of
new
york
while
the
carpathia
was
coming
into
dock
while
relatives
of
those
on
board
were
at
the
docks
to
meet
them
and
anxiously
buying
any
paper
that
might
contain
news
no
one
on
the
carpathia
could
have
supplied
such
information
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
world
at
that
moment
who
knew
any
details
of
the
titanic
disaster
and
the
only
possible
conclusion
is
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
deliberate
fabrication
to
sell
the
paper
this
is
a
repetition
of
the
same
defect
in
human
nature
noticed
in
the
provision
of
safety
appliances
on
board
ship
the
lack
of
consideration
for
the
other
man
the
remedy
is
the
same
the
law
it
should
be
a
criminal
offence
for
anyone
to
disseminate
deliberate
falsehoods
that
cause
fear
and
grief
the
moral
responsibility
of
the
press
is
very
great
and
its
duty
of
supplying
the
public
with
only
clean
correct
news
is
correspondingly
heavy
if
the
general
public
is
not
yet
prepared
to
go
so
far
as
to
stop
the
publication
of
such
news
by
refusing
to
buy
those
papers
that
publish
it
then
the
law
should
be
enlarged
to
include
such
cases
libel
is
an
offence
and
this
is
very
much
worse
than
any
libel
could
ever
be
it
is
only
right
to
add
that
the
majority
of
the
new
york
papers
were
careful
only
to
report
such
news
as
had
been
obtained
legitimately
from
survivors
or
from
carpathia
passengers
it
was
sometimes
exaggerated
and
sometimes
not
true
at
all
but
from
the
point
of
reporting
what
was
heard
most
of
it
was
quite
correct
one
more
thing
must
be
referred
to
the
prevalence
of
superstitious
beliefs
concerning
the
titanic
i
suppose
no
ship
ever
left
port
with
so
much
miserable
nonsense
showered
on
her
in
the
first
place
there
is
no
doubt
many
people
refused
to
sail
on
her
because
it
was
her
maiden
voyage
and
this
apparently
is
a
common
superstition
even
the
clerk
of
the
white
star
office
where
i
purchased
my
ticket
admitted
it
was
a
reason
that
prevented
people
from
sailing
a
number
of
people
have
written
to
the
press
to
say
they
had
thought
of
sailing
on
her
or
had
decided
to
sail
on
her
but
because
of
omens
cancelled
the
passage
many
referred
to
the
sister
ship
the
olympic
pointed
to
the
ill
luck
that
they
say
has
dogged
her
her
collision
with
the
hawke
and
a
second
mishap
necessitating
repairs
and
a
wait
in
harbour
where
passengers
deserted
her
they
prophesied
even
greater
disaster
for
the
titanic
saying
they
would
not
dream
of
travelling
on
the
boat
even
some
aboard
were
very
nervous
in
an
undefined
way
one
lady
said
she
had
never
wished
to
take
this
boat
but
her
friends
had
insisted
and
bought
her
ticket
and
she
had
not
had
a
happy
moment
since
a
friend
told
me
of
the
voyage
of
the
olympic
from
southampton
after
the
wait
in
harbour
and
said
there
was
a
sense
of
gloom
pervading
the
whole
ship
the
stewards
and
stewardesses
even
going
so
far
as
to
say
it
was
a
this
crew
by
the
way
was
largely
transferred
to
the
titanic
the
incident
with
the
new
york
at
southampton
the
appearance
of
the
stoker
at
queenstown
in
the
funnel
combine
with
all
this
to
make
a
mass
of
nonsense
in
which
apparently
sensible
people
believe
or
which
at
any
rate
they
discuss
correspondence
is
published
with
an
official
of
the
white
star
line
from
some
one
imploring
them
not
to
name
the
new
ship
gigantic
because
it
seems
like
tempting
fate
when
the
titanic
has
been
sunk
it
would
seem
almost
as
if
we
were
back
in
the
middle
ages
when
witches
were
burned
because
they
kept
black
cats
there
seems
no
more
reason
why
a
black
stoker
should
be
an
ill
omen
for
the
titanic
than
a
black
cat
should
be
for
an
old
woman
the
only
reason
for
referring
to
these
foolish
details
is
that
a
surprisingly
large
number
of
people
think
there
may
be
something
in
it
the
effect
is
this
that
if
a
ship
company
and
a
number
of
passengers
get
imbued
with
that
undefined
dread
of
the
unknown
the
relics
no
doubt
of
the
savage
fear
of
what
he
does
not
understand
it
has
an
unpleasant
effect
on
the
harmonious
working
of
the
ship
the
officers
and
crew
feel
the
depressing
influence
and
it
may
even
spread
so
far
as
to
prevent
them
being
as
alert
and
keen
as
they
otherwise
would
may
even
result
in
some
duty
not
being
as
well
done
as
usual
just
as
the
unconscious
demand
for
speed
and
haste
to
get
across
the
atlantic
may
have
tempted
captains
to
take
a
risk
they
might
otherwise
not
have
done
so
these
gloomy
forebodings
may
have
more
effect
sometimes
than
we
imagine
only
a
little
thing
is
required
sometimes
to
weigh
down
the
balance
for
and
against
a
certain
course
of
action
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
of
mental
impressions
it
must
be
recorded
that
one
impression
remains
constant
with
us
all
that
of
the
deepest
gratitude
that
we
came
safely
through
the
wreck
of
the
titanic
and
its
corollary
that
our
legacy
from
the
wreck
our
debt
to
those
who
were
lost
with
her
is
to
see
as
far
as
in
us
lies
that
such
things
are
impossible
ever
again
meanwhile
we
can
say
of
them
as
shelley
himself
the
victim
of
a
similar
disaster
says
of
his
friend
keats
in
adonais
peace
peace
he
is
not
dead
he
doth
not
sleep
he
hath
awakened
from
the
dream
of
life
he
lives
he
wakes
is
death
is
dead
not
he
mourn
not

adonais
