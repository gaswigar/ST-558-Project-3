notes
in
addition
to
the
notes
below
and
so
you
will
think
all
the
spelling
errors
introduced
by
the
printers
of
the
time
have
been
corrected
here
are
the
first
few
lines
of
hamlet
as
they
are
presented
herein
barnardo
who
there
fran
nay
answer
me
stand
vnfold
your
selfe
bar
long
liue
the
king
as
i
understand
it
the
printers
often
ran
out
of
certain
words
or
letters
they
had
often
packed
into
a
cliche
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
term
cliche
thus
being
unwilling
to
unpack
the
cliches
and
thus
you
will
see
some
substitutions
that
look
very
odd
as
the
exchanges
of
u
for
v
v
for
u
above
you
may
wonder
why
they
did
it
this
way
presuming
shakespeare
did
not
actually
write
the
play
in
this
manner
the
answer
is
that
they
may
have
packed
liue
into
a
cliche
at
a
time
when
they
were
out
of
v
having
used
vv
in
place
of
some
w
etc
this
was
a
common
practice
of
the
day
as
print
was
still
quite
expensive
and
they
did
want
to
spend
more
on
a
wider
selection
of
characters
than
they
had
to
you
will
find
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
errors
in
this
text
as
i
have
mentioned
in
other
times
and
places
many
scholars
have
an
extreme
attachment
to
these
errors
and
many
have
accorded
them
a
very
high
place
in
the
canon
of
shakespeare
my
father
read
an
assortment
of
these
made
available
to
him
by
cambridge
university
in
england
for
several
months
in
a
glass
room
constructed
for
the
purpose
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
read
all
those
available
great
detail
determined
from
the
various
changes
that
shakespeare
most
likely
did
not
write
in
nearly
as
many
of
a
variety
of
errors
we
credit
him
for
even
though
he
was
for
signing
his
name
with
several
different
spellings
so
please
take
this
into
account
when
reading
the
comments
below
made
by
our
volunteer
who
prepared
this
file
you
may
see
errors
that
are
not
errors
so
this
caveat
have
not
changed
the
canon
errors

what
this
is
and
is
this
was
taken
from
a
copy
of
shakespeare
first
folio
and
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
in
ascii
to
the
printed
text
the
elongated
s
have
been
changed
to
small
s
and
the
conjoined
ae
have
been
changed
to
ae
i
have
left
the
spelling
punctuation
capitalization
as
close
as
possible
to
the
printed
text
i
have
corrected
some
spelling
mistakes
i
have
put
together
a
spelling
dictionary
devised
from
the
spellings
of
the
geneva
bible
and
shakespeare
first
folio
and
have
unified
spellings
according
to
this
template
typo
and
expanded
abbreviations
as
i
have
come
across
them
everything
within
brackets
is
what
i
have
added
so
if
you
do
like
that
you
can
delete
everything
within
the
brackets
if
you
want
a
purer
shakespeare
another
thing
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
there
are
textual
differences
between
various
copies
of
the
first
folio
so
there
may
be
differences
other
than
what
i
have
mentioned
above
between
this
and
other
first
folio
editions
this
is
due
to
the
habit
of
setting
the
type
and
running
off
a
number
of
copies
and
then
proofing
the
printed
copy
and
correcting
the
type
and
then
continuing
the
printing
run
the
proof
run
was
thrown
away
but
incorporated
into
the
printed
copies
this
is
just
the
way
it
is
the
text
i
have
used
was
a
composite
of
more
than
different
first
folio
editions
best
pages
if
you

any

punctuation
errors

if
you

with
my
spelling
choices
please
feel
free
to

i

wrathfull
curse
i
do
beleeue
that
violent

were
laid
vpon
the
life
of
this
duke
suf
a
dreadfull
oath
sworne
with
a
solemn
tongue
what
instance
giues
lord
warwicke
for
his
vow
war
see
how
the
blood
is
setled
in
his

oft
haue
i
seene
a
ghost
of
ashy
semblance
meager
pale
and
bloodlesse
being
all
descended
to
the
labouring
heart
who
in
the
conflict
that
it
holds
with
death
attracts
the
same
for
aydance
the
enemy
which
with
the
heart
there
cooles
and
ne
returneth
to
blush
and
beautifie
the
cheeke
againe
but
see
his
face
is
blacke
and
full
of
blood
his
further
out
than
when
he
liued
staring
full
gastly
like
a
strangled
man
his
hayre
vprear
his
nostrils
stretcht
with
strugling
his
hands
abroad
display
as
one
that
graspt

tugg
for
life

was
by
strength
subdude
looke
on
the
sheets
his
haire
you
see
is
sticking
his
well
proportion
beard
made
ruffe

rugged
like
to
the

corne
by
tempest
lodged
it
can
not
be

he
was
murdred
heere
the

who
should
do
the
d

had
him
in

you
forsooth
had
the

would
not
feast
him
like

and
is
well
seene
he
found
an
