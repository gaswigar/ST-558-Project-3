chapter

in
san
antonio
the
musicians
were
tuning
their
instruments
somewhere
behind
the
palms
in
the
hotel
courtyard
it
was
one
of
the
older
hotels
of
san
antonio
much
sought
by
northern
tourists
on
account
of
that
same
inner
garden
around
which
the
big
building
stretched
itself
the
rooms
opening
on
to
it
had
balconies
and
looking
down
from
them
into
the
tropical
growth
of
palms
and
banana
trees
and
roses
one
felt
that
it
was
summer
time
no
matter
what
the
calendar
said
it
was
on
one
of
the
second
floor
balconies
at
the
close
of
a
november
day
that
mary
ware
stood
looking
around
her
with
eager
eyes
wreath
and
made
such
a
thick
screen
that
no
one
could
see
her
so
she
might
lean
over
the
railing
as
far
as
she
pleased
to
watch
the
brilliantly
lighted
scene
below
electric
bulbs
were
strung
through
the
cacti
and
devil
ivy
like
elfin
lamps
there
was
a
shine
of
brass
buttons
as
colored
bell
boys
scudded
across
the
open
space
with
clinking
or
jingling
keys
and
through
the
glass
doors
beyond
came
the
gleam
of
silver
and
flowers
where
the
waiters
were
arranging
the
tables
for
dinner
there
was
to
be
a
military
banquet
in
one
of
the
private
and
already
the
guests
were
beginning
to
arrive
for
the
reception
which
was
to
precede
it
so
much
bunting
was
draped
over
the
arch
between
the
office
corridors
and
this
inner
court
that
the
view
was
somewhat
obscured
but
by
leaning
dangerously
far
over
the
railing
mary
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
legs
of
a
uniform
now
and
then
strolling
along
beside
the
trailing
skirt
of
a
dainty
evening
gown
all
this
warmth
and
life
and
color
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
dreary
solitudes
of
the
snow
covered
mining
camp
which
she
had
just
left
it
had
been
winter
for
nearly
a
month
up
in
the
hills
of
arizona
and
lone
rock
in
the
winter
was
such
a
barren
waste
socially
that
her
present
surroundings
seemed
wildly
exciting
in
lone
rock
it
was
a
matter
of
comment
whenever
a
human
being
passed
the
house
and
even
a
stray
mule
stumbling
along
with
a
bell
on
its
neck
was
enough
to
call
one
to
the
windows
the
orchestra
behind
the
palms
having
finished
its
tuning
swung
into
a
gay
at
the
sudden
burst
of
music
mary
drew
a
long
breath
and
stood
up
straight
her
pulses
something
delightful
was
beginning
to
happen
two
girls
one
in
white
and
one
in
pale
attended
by
a
young
lieutenant
and
a
still
younger
man
in
civilian
evening
dress
came
out
under
the
arch
and
strolled
along
past
the
banana
trees
to
the
garden
seat
just
below
her
from
her
hiding
place
behind
the
mary
watched
them
as
only
a
sociable
little
soul
could
watch
who
for
months
had
been
hungering
for
such
companionship
she
clutched
the
railing
with
both
hands
hoping
fervently
that
they
would
stop
they
did
pause
for
a
few
moments
just
under
the
balcony
so
near
that
for
the
little
while
they
stood
there
she
could
almost
feel
herself
to
be
one
of
the
party
she
could
even
smell
the
white
violets
that
the
girl
in
white
wore
on
her
corsage
and
was
close
enough
to
see
that
an
amber
comb
was
slipping
out
of
the
soft
hair
arranged
so
becomingly
on
the
graceful
little
head
each
laugh
and
gesture
sent
it
slipping
lower
and
lower
till
involuntarily
mary
hand
went
out
to
stop
it
then
she
drew
back
in
confusion
she
had
almost
called
attention
to
herself
by
speaking
aloud
let
go
into
the
other
court
insisted
the
girl
in
yellow
i
want
to
show
you
the
alligators
in
the
fountain
wade
to
convince
you
that
you
really
in
the
sunny
south
some
people
ca
appreciate
alligators
bogey
there
for
instance
her
disdainful
glance
indicated
the
lieutenant
he
jeers
at
me
for
liking
them
but
i
think
they
are
more
interesting
than
half
the
people
one
meets
what
a
nickname
for
such
a
dignified
officer
thought
mary
peeping
over
the
railing
to
see
how
such
banter
was
received
evidently
the
lieutenant
was
accustomed
to
it
for
he
smiled
indulgently
as
one
would
at
a
spoiled
child
of
a
feather
you
know
was
his
answer
go
on
roberta
do
care
to
flock
with
alligators
myself
but
if
you
do
we
follow
and
see
it
done
roberta
deigned
no
reply
but
a
glance
intended
to
be
withering
which
failed
in
its
purpose
because
it
was
only
counterfeit
her
eyes
were
as
dark
as
a
gypsy
and
she
had
the
curliest
lashes
mary
had
ever
seen
a
boyish
straightforwardness
of
manner
contradicted
their
coquettish
curliness
however
she
had
an
air
that
comes
only
from
being
brought
up
in
a
houseful
of
teasing
brothers
the
man
in
civilian
dress
whom
she
called
wade
watched
her
as
if
he
had
found
a
new
species
of
girl
uncertain
what
she
might
say
or
do
next
he
was
familiar
with
the
coquettish
kind
and
with
the
kind
but
this
combination
puzzled
him
mary
longed
to
follow
as
the
four
went
slowly
away
together
into
the
adjoining
court
wholly
unconscious
that
they
had
left
an
indelible
memory
behind
them
or
that
they
had
revealed
anything
of
themselves
and
their
affairs
to
an
unseen
listener
but
to
mary
it
was
as
if
a
new
book
had
been
opened
before
her
and
she
had
been
allowed
a
glimpse
of
one
page
and
the
attractive
picture
that
illustrated
it
it
was
never
necessary
for
her
to
begin
at
the
first
chapter
of
a
book
often
attracted
by
some
paragraph
in
the
middle
she
would
plunge
into
a
story
only
turning
back
for
the
beginning
after
she
had
pursued
it
eagerly
through
to
the
last
word
and
found
how
it
all
ended
illustration
mary
ware
in
texas
what
an
adorable
little
curl
now
as
the
interesting
group
walked
away
she
fervently
hoped
that
fate
would
send
them
across
her
path
sometime
again
during
her
sojourn
in
san
antonio
that
she
might
piece
together
the
rest
of
the
story
all
that
she
knew
now
was
that
the
girl
in
white
was
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
majors
at
fort
sam
houston
that
the
lieutenant
had
known
roberta
ever
since
he
was
a
cadet
at
the
west
texas
military
school
and
that
it
was
her
brothers
who
had
dubbed
him
bogey
she
had
learned
also
that
this
was
wade
first
visit
to
texas
and
that
roberta
was
trying
to
impress
him
with
it
by
marvelous
tales
so
that
he
would
decide
to
spend
the
winter
in
san
antonio
instead
of
going
on
to
mexico
but
if
the
conversation
revealed
little
the
picture
they
made
as
they
stood
against
the
tropical
background
of
palms
and
banana
trees
held
many
suggestions
mary
felt
that
she
knew
all
about
lieutenants
having
met
two
at
a
kentucky
where
she
had
gone
to
be
at
a
wedding
when
she
was
only
fourteen
fashions
evidently
had
not
changed
in
lieutenants
since
these
looked
as
if
they
might
have
been
taken
out
of
the
same
box
that
furnished
the
first
soldiers
of
her
acquaintance
but
the
girls
there
had
been
many
changes
in
girls
since
she
last
saw
any
of
this
kind
it
was
eight
months
since
she
had
left
school
at
the
end
of
the
easter
vacation
and
none
of
the
girls
at
warwick
hall
were
doing
their
hair
then
as
roberta
and
the
daughter
were
doing
theirs
each
had
a
very
elaborate
coiffure
with
a
cluster
of
little
short
curls
escaping
to
nestle
against
their
white
necks
her
attention
was
especially
called
to
this
new
style
by
escort
whom
mary
had
classified
in
her
mind
as
a
callow
youth
with
a
habit
of
making
gallant
little
personal
speeches
when
they
first
stepped
into
the
court
roberta
had
thrown
a
white
scarf
about
her
almost
as
light
as
thistledown
and
glistening
with
crystal
beads
which
spangled
its
soft
meshes
like
dewdrops
as
they
turned
to
go
it
slipped
from
her
shoulders
and
wade
sprang
forward
to
replace
it
drawing
it
around
her
shoulders
he
said
with
a
melting
glance
at
her
dark
hair
what
an
adorable
little
curl
o
ringlet
she
blushed
a
rosy
red
when
ringlet
o
ringlet
she
clipped
you
from
her
head
mary
who
knew
her
tennyson
like
her
multiplication
table
recalled
the
next
lines
ringlet
o
ringlet
she
gave
you
me
and
said
kiss
it
love
and
put
it
by
if
this
can
change
why
so
can
i
roberta
only
laughed
not
in
the
least
impressed
by
his
manner
nor
embarrassed
by
the
inference
of
his
quotation
mary
knew
that
she
could
not
copy
the
curls
but
she
decided
to
try
the
rest
of
the
coiffure
in
the
morning
not
a
single
twist
or
wave
had
escaped
her
sharp
eyes
in
the
darkness
of
her
retreat
after
they
had
gone
she
put
her
hands
to
her
head
rehearsing
in
pantomime
each
move
she
would
have
to
make
to
produce
the
result
she
admired
suddenly
her
hands
dropped
and
one
clutched
the
railing
as
the
window
shutters
of
the
next
room
were
thrown
open
with
a
bang
and
some
one
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
adjoining
hers
the
intruder
was
a
large
and
elderly
woman
in
a
rustling
black
dress
the
light
from
the
room
streaming
out
behind
her
showed
that
she
was
portly
and
and
the
way
she
peered
through
the
vines
changing
quickly
from
one
to
another
showed
that
she
was
impatient
when
she
turned
mary
saw
that
her
dress
which
was
made
to
fasten
in
the
back
was
open
from
collar
to
belt
and
she
readily
guessed
the
trouble
forgetting
that
her
presence
was
unknown
to
the
anxious
watcher
she
leaned
forward
through
the
dark
saying
politely
can
i
help
you
madam
if
a
hand
had
reached
out
and
grabbed
her
the
old
lady
could
not
have
been
more
startled
with
a
stifled
shriek
she
backed
up
against
the
wall
to
hide
her
open
bodice
and
stood
there
limp
and
panting
merciful
how
you
scared
me
she
breathed
as
mary
face
appeared
in
the
full
light
when
she
saw
only
a
little
of
seventeen
or
thereabouts
her
relief
found
vent
in
a
hysterical
giggle
it
shook
her
plump
shoulders
until
they
both
started
to
laughing
so
hard
that
she
could
barely
find
voice
to
explain
or
mary
to
apologize
i
just
could
get
my
dress
hooked
up
the
back
she
finally
managed
to
say
i
rang
half
a
dozen
times
for
a
chambermaid
but
the
ones
on
this
floor
all
seem
to
be
off
duty
this
time
of
evening
and
i
wo
ask
a
as
some
of
the
ladies
do
i
do
think
it
decent
so
i
just
thought
i
look
down
into
the
court
and
see
if
i
could
catch
sight
of
james
he
did
it
yesterday
and
i
vowed
i
never
ask
him
again
he
willing
enough
but
he
kept
me
standing
a
solid
half
hour
by
the
clock
and
we
were
both
tuckered
out
when
he
got
through
let
me
come
and
do
it
for
you
said
mary
with
her
usual
alacrity
for
following
up
promising
beginnings
oh
if
you
only
would
was
the
grateful
answer
i
go
in
and
unlock
the
door
before
she
could
finish
her
sentence
mary
had
climbed
lightly
over
the
railing
which
divided
their
balconies
and
was
following
her
into
her
room
through
the
long
windows
that
opened
to
the
floor
do
you
know
confided
the
old
lady
while
mary
deftly
fastened
the
hooks
i
think
a
hotel
is
the
lonesomest
place
on
the
face
of
the
globe
for
a
woman
i
come
down
here
once
a
year
or
so
with
my
husband
and
he
has
a
good
time
sitting
around
in
the
lobby
smoking
and
making
friends
with
stockmen
like
himself
but
by
the
end
of
the
second
day
homesick
for
the
ranch
of
course
i
enjoy
the
stores
and
the
crowds
on
the
street
and
seeing
all
the
finely
dressed
tourists
at
but
we
been
down
here
three
days
now
and
you
the
first
person
i
spoken
to
besides
the
chambermaid
and
james
it
all
right
for
strangers
to
keep
themselves
to
themselves
i
suppose
but
i
must
say
it
a
sort
of
strain
when
it
comes
to
being
the
stranger
yourself
i
want
somebody
to
neighbor
with
so
do
i
responded
mary
with
such
heartiness
that
the
old
lady
instantly
expanded
into
warm
friendliness
before
she
was
fairly
fastened
into
her
rustling
black
and
purple
gown
she
had
confided
to
mary
that
it
was
her
very
best
one
and
that
it
just
would
wear
out
because
it
was
too
fine
for
church
and
she
had
no
occasion
to
put
it
on
save
when
she
made
her
rare
visits
to
san
antonio
the
sleeves
had
been
changed
so
many
times
to
keep
it
in
fashion
that
her
dressmaker
had
refused
to
alter
it
another
time
even
if
the
lace
on
it
did
cost
five
dollars
a
yard
james
said
why
did
she
wear
it
at
home
and
get
done
with
it
but
she
told
him
much
comfort
a
body
would
take
around
home
in
the
tight
gear
a
dressmaker
boned
you
up
in
but
she
have
to
do
something
for
full
skirts
were
clear
out
now
and
she
felt
like
a
balloon
when
other
people
were
going
around
as
slim
and
lank
as
starved
snakes
it
does
take
long
to
get
out
of
date
she
added
when
living
up
in
the
hills
in
the
oh
i
know
that
agreed
mary
i
been
living
in
a
lonesome
little
spot
out
in
arizona
for
so
long
that
i
nearly
forgotten
what
civilization
is
like
you
do
look
like
it
was
the
frank
comment
as
the
still
franker
gaze
of
her
listener
travelled
over
her
dress
from
top
to
bottom
noting
every
detail
oh
this
answered
mary
as
if
the
eyes
had
spoken
this
is
a
dress
that
i
got
in
new
york
last
easter
vacation
i
was
in
school
at
washington
but
as
i
had
to
leave
at
the
end
of
the
term
and
go
back
home
i
had
no
occasion
to
wear
it
since
that
why
it
looks
so
new
now
do
sit
down
and
tell
me
about
it
urged
her
hostess
hospitably
i
always
wanted
to
go
to
washington
she
pushed
forward
a
low
rocker
and
took
the
arm
chair
opposite
with
such
a
look
of
pleasurable
anticipation
on
her
kindly
old
face
that
mary
obeyed
she
knew
how
it
felt
to
be
fairly
bursting
with
a
sociability
for
which
there
was
no
outlet
she
had
experienced
that
same
sensation
a
few
minutes
before
when
she
watched
roberta
and
the
daughter
go
by
with
their
friends
besides
she
felt
a
real
liking
for
this
companionable
old
lady
who
introduced
herself
as
barnaby
of
bauer
texas
james
barnaby
she
the
real
comfortable
homey
sort
thought
mary
who
had
been
much
given
of
late
to
classifying
people
she
like
mission
furniture
plain
and
simple
and
genuine
she
be
her
simple
unpretentious
self
no
matter
what
gilt
and
veneer
she
found
herself
among
mary
was
proud
of
her
insight
afterward
when
she
learned
more
about
barnaby
family
they
had
come
out
from
ohio
over
fifty
years
before
when
she
was
so
young
that
she
could
barely
remember
the
great
prairie
schooner
that
brought
them
they
had
suffered
all
the
hardships
of
the
early
texas
settlers
gone
through
the
horrors
of
the
indian
uprisings
and
fought
their
way
through
with
sturdy
pioneer
fortitude
to
the
place
where
they
could
fold
their
hands
and
enjoy
the
comforts
of
the
civilization
they
had
helped
to
establish
she
told
mary
little
of
this
now
however
but
led
her
on
with
many
questions
to
talk
of
herself
barnaby
had
a
lively
curiosity
and
always
took
the
most
straightforward
means
to
gratify
it
she
interested
in
people
no
matter
who
they
are
just
as
i
am
thought
mary
instantly
recognizing
the
spirit
which
prompted
the
questions
and
for
that
reason
was
led
on
to
tell
more
than
she
would
have
told
to
most
strangers
she
did
not
take
the
world
at
large
into
her
confidence
now
as
she
had
done
in
her
chatterbox
days
in
just
a
few
moments
barnaby
had
a
very
fair
snapshot
picture
of
the
ware
family
in
her
mind
mary
had
given
it
very
simply
i
had
gone
from
school
at
warwick
hall
to
new
york
to
spend
the
easter
vacation
with
my
sister
joyce
she
an
artist
and
has
her
studio
there
and
we
got
word
that
my
oldest
brother
jack
had
been
dreadfully
hurt
in
an
accident
at
the
mines
where
he
was
manager
that
it
had
made
him
a
cripple
for
life
we
all
just
adore
jack
so
of
course
i
packed
up
and
went
straight
back
to
arizona
it
was
possible
for
joyce
to
leave
just
then
and
my
brother
holland
is
in
the
navy
and
of
course
he
could
get
away
except
the
trained
nurse
there
was
nobody
with
mamma
at
the
time
but
my
youngest
brother
norman
and
as
he
is
only
fourteen
i
felt
that
i
had
to
go
i
hope
he
got
better
right
away
interrupted
barnaby
eagerly
yes
he
did
for
awhile
he
even
got
so
that
he
could
wheel
himself
around
in
his
chair
and
go
down
to
the
office
awhile
every
morning
but
as
soon
as
the
cold
weather
set
in
he
began
to
have
such
dreadful
rheumatism
that
the
doctor
said
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
take
him
to
a
milder
climate
so
we
got
ready
right
away
and
brought
him
down
here
it
must
have
been
a
hard
trip
for
him
commented
barnaby
with
a
sympathetic
shake
of
the
head
arizona
always
did
seem
to
me
like
the
place
i
do
see
how
you
managed
it
him
in
a
wheeled
chair
and
so
helpless
oh
we
came
in
a
private
car
mary
made
haste
to
explain
and
jack
really
enjoyed
the
trip
waffles
the
old
colored
cook
on
the
car
you
know
just
laid
himself
out
to
please
him
and
the
porter
was
so
strong
and
helpful
h
exclaimed
her
interested
listener
i
always
thought
i
like
to
travel
in
a
private
car
it
must
be
such
a
nice
way
to
get
over
the
country
but
it
is
everybody
that
can
afford
it
it
was
on
the
tip
of
mary
honest
little
tongue
to
explain
that
it
was
not
their
car
they
had
come
as
guests
of
robeson
one
of
the
mine
owners
but
barnaby
interrupted
her
with
a
question
did
you
all
go
out
in
a
big
red
automobile
this
afternoon
i
been
trying
to
think
ever
since
you
came
in
here
where
it
was
i
seen
you
before
and
i
believe
it
was
with
that
party
there
was
a
little
lady
in
black
and
a
boy
and
a
rather
man
with
iron
gray
whiskers
i
heard
him
giving
orders
to
the
chauffeur
to
go
out
to
the
missions
yes
agreed
mary
that
was
robeson
one
of
the
owners
of
the
mine
he
so
fond
of
jack
and
has
been
so
lovely
to
all
of
us
on
his
account
his
valet
stayed
with
jack
while
we
went
out
to
see
the
town
he
going
on
to
mexico
this
afternoon
again
she
was
on
the
point
of
saying
that
it
was
as
robeson
guests
they
had
enjoyed
the
outing
in
the
expensive
car
but
another
question
switched
her
off
to
another
subject
and
left
barnaby
with
the
impression
that
the
wares
were
wealthy
beyond
computation
mary
had
the
manner
of
one
always
accustomed
to
luxury
and
her
easy
way
of
referring
to
the
studio
in
new
york
and
the
private
car
and
the
valet
made
one
think
she
was
born
to
purple
and
fine
linen
the
impression
was
deepened
later
when
the
barnabys
found
themselves
at
the
same
table
with
mary
and
norman
in
the
ware
was
having
dinner
in
her
rooms
with
jack
mary
explained
he
was
sensitive
about
being
wheeled
into
a
public
so
she
and
her
mother
would
take
turns
staying
with
him
with
a
brief
glance
at
the
menu
card
mary
ordered
dinner
for
herself
and
brother
before
barnaby
had
adjusted
his
glasses
on
his
long
nose
and
stumbled
through
the
menu
he
always
read
the
bill
of
fare
aloud
to
his
wife
pronouncing
the
french
words
exactly
as
they
were
spelled
and
they
paused
to
discuss
the
nature
of
each
unfamiliar
dish
with
the
amused
waiter
before
ordering
the
ease
with
which
mary
ordered
gave
further
evidence
to
barnaby
that
the
wares
had
always
been
accustomed
to
sumptuous
living
and
to
being
waited
on
hand
and
foot
and
it
was
proof
to
mary
that
james
was
as
genuine
and
primitive
as
his
wife
when
he
made
no
attempt
to
cover
his
ignorance
of
french
menus
looking
up
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
he
said
to
the
waiter
just
bring
me
the
same
as
my
wife
ordered
then
he
added
with
an
odd
smile
that
gave
an
irresistible
expression
of
humor
to
his
face
i
always
take
the
blazed
trail
when
there
is
one
it
a
heap
sight
safer
than
striking
out
for
yourself
when
you
in
tall
timber
evidently
barnaby
had
told
him
all
that
she
had
learned
of
the
ware
family
for
he
at
once
began
making
minute
inquiries
about
arizona
and
the
mines
with
the
interest
of
a
shrewd
genial
old
man
who
kept
pace
with
the
times
and
liked
the
companionship
of
young
people
they
were
warm
friends
before
the
meal
was
over
and
mary
hurried
afterward
to
report
all
she
could
remember
to
jack
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
making
the
most
of
everything
she
saw
and
heard
for
his
entertainment
she
found
him
in
his
chair
out
on
the
balcony
with
her
mother
looking
down
on
the
same
scene
she
had
watched
earlier
in
the
evening
ware
had
just
tucked
a
around
him
and
drawn
a
wrap
over
her
own
shoulders
when
mary
opened
the
door
of
the
room
behind
them
and
started
across
the
floor
to
join
them
some
letters
had
been
sent
up
while
she
was
at
dinner
and
seeing
one
on
the
table
addressed
to
herself
she
paused
to
read
it
before
joining
them
it
was
just
a
note
from
one
of
the
girls
at
warwick
hall
who
knowing
mary
fondness
for
the
beautiful
old
garden
there
always
enclosed
some
leaf
or
flower
from
it
every
time
she
wrote
this
time
several
violets
fell
out
withered
but
still
sweet
as
mary
stooped
to
pick
them
up
she
heard
jack
say
in
a
voice
so
full
of
hearty
enjoyment
that
she
scarcely
recognized
it
for
his
this
certainly
is
great
what
a
world
of
things
we
been
missing
all
these
years
little
mother
i
never
realized
just
how
much
we
have
missed
till
i
went
east
last
year
then
afterwards
the
days
were
so
full
of
work
and
the
new
responsibilities
that
i
did
have
time
to
think
about
it
much
but
i
can
see
now
what
a
dull
gray
existence
had
for
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
there
only
been
three
backgrounds
for
you
a
little
kansas
village
a
tent
on
the
edge
of
the
arizona
desert
and
a
lonely
mining
camp
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
seen
a
sight
like
this
the
scattered
violets
were
all
picked
up
now
but
mary
still
stood
by
the
table
waiting
for
her
mother
reply
it
so
long
ago
i
have
to
stop
and
count
up
let
me
see
and
joyce
really
it
almost
a
quarter
of
a
century
since
i
been
in
a
large
city
and
seen
anything
like
this
in
the
way
of
illuminations
with
music
and
crowds
your
father
took
me
to
new
york
the
winter
after
we
were
married
before
that
i
always
had
my
full
share
i
visited
a
great
deal
and
travelled
with
cousin
kate
and
her
father
and
i
sure
that
no
one
could
want
anything
brighter
and
sweeter
and
more
complete
than
life
as
i
found
it
as
a
girl
in
old
kentucky
home
as
i
had
so
much
more
than
most
people
the
first
part
of
my
life
i
could
complain
when
i
had
less
afterwards
but
i
certainly
do
enjoy
this
she
added
earnestly
as
the
orchestra
began
the
haunting
air
of
the
mexican
swallow
song
and
the
odor
of
roses
stole
up
from
below
the
court
was
filled
now
with
gay
little
groups
of
people
who
had
the
air
of
finding
life
one
continual
holiday
the
cheeriness
of
the
reply
almost
brought
tears
to
mary
eyes
as
she
realized
for
the
first
time
how
much
more
than
any
of
them
her
mother
must
have
suffered
from
the
hardships
of
their
early
poverty
because
it
was
in
such
sharp
contrast
to
what
she
had
known
before
to
hide
the
little
quiver
that
wanted
to
creep
into
her
voice
mary
laughed
as
she
joined
them
dragging
a
chair
through
the
french
window
after
her
here
you
sit
like
two
comfortable
cats
in
the
lap
of
luxury
she
said
you
begin
to
purr
soon
that
exactly
what
we
doing
now
answered
jack
congratulating
ourselves
on
being
in
this
land
of
summer
with
every
comfort
at
hand
and
a
free
show
to
entertain
us
this
is
as
good
as
being
in
a
at
the
opera
mary
settled
herself
with
her
chair
tipped
back
on
its
rockers
and
looked
down
on
the
court
below
i
wish
we
could
stay
at
this
hotel
all
winter
she
exclaimed
i
wish
we
could
be
as
rich
all
the
time
as
i
feel
ever
since
we
started
south
in
robeson
car
felt
as
opulent
and
as
elegant
as
if
we
owned
the
earth
and
noticed
that
you
and
mamma
take
to
luxury
quite
as
readily
as
i
do
like
ducks
to
water
norman
is
learning
fast
too
for
one
of
his
opportunities
he
having
the
time
of
his
life
now
down
in
the
lobby
just
things
at
night
he
asked
me
for
a
quarter
when
i
left
him
to
get
some
postcards
of
the
alamo
and
the
plaza
to
send
home
well
queried
jack
as
she
paused
mary
had
had
the
family
finances
in
hand
since
his
illness
and
her
economical
clutch
had
earned
her
the
title
of
of
the
treasury
oh
i
gave
it
to
him
she
answered
gave
it
with
a
lordly
sweep
of
the
hand
as
if
bestowing
millions
were
a
daily
habit
of
mine
but
it
will
be
a
different
story
a
copper
cent
may
be
too
great
a
boon
for
my
family
to
ask
me
to
part
with
we
go
with
the
sad
realization
that
we
all
as
poor
as
old
blue
turkey
hen
what
the
odds
so
long
as
you
happy
quoted
jack
there
was
a
long
pause
in
which
they
listened
to
the
music
each
enjoying
to
the
fullest
the
novelty
of
being
in
such
a
place
then
jack
asked
did
you
have
any
adventures
down
in
the
we
rather
expected
that
have
a
series
of
them
to
report
mercy
yes
i
had
half
a
dozen
since
i
saw
you
last
very
mild
ones
though
i
seen
some
most
interesting
people
a
major
daughter
and
a
lieutenant
from
the
post
called
bogey
and
i
overheard
the
beginning
of
a
romance
a
most
sentimental
request
for
an
little
curl
and
i
hooked
james
barnaby
of
bauer
texas
up
in
her
best
black
and
purple
gown
and
james
himself
has
invited
me
to
take
luck
with
them
up
at
the
barnaby
ranch
any
time
i
choose
to
go
he
a
dear
and
so
is
she
and
if
you
only
her
chatter
was
stopped
by
a
sudden
exclamation
from
jack
and
following
his
gaze
into
the
court
below
she
saw
two
of
the
group
in
which
she
had
been
so
interested
earlier
in
the
evening
that
the
lieutenant
i
told
you
about
she
exclaimed
excitedly
that
bogey
and
the
other
is
the
major
daughter
i
do
wonder
that
you
stunned
at
the
sight
of
a
pretty
girl
like
that
when
been
such
ages
since
you
have
seen
one
i
stunned
because
it
happens
to
be
a
girl
i
know
exclaimed
jack
in
a
tone
almost
as
excited
as
her
own
that
gay
melville
and
i
met
her
at
the
locusts
the
night
i
stopped
in
lloydsboro
valley
with
the
shermans
are
you
sure
gasped
mary
dead
sure
she
played
the
violin
that
evening
and
you
ca
take
your
eyes
off
her
face
when
she
plays
it
so
sweet
and
you
could
never
forget
it
after
you
watched
her
through
one
performance
then
her
hair
there
no
mistaking
and
that
little
trick
of
lifting
her
chin
besides
it
no
surprising
matter
to
see
her
she
lives
here
and
she
a
popular
girl
oh
i
know
it
exclaimed
mary
and
i
known
all
the
time
that
her
home
is
in
san
antonio
have
i
heard
the
warwick
hall
seniors
talk
of
her
by
the
hour
but
somehow
i
never
put
two
and
two
together
and
got
it
through
my
head
that
we
in
the
same
town
really
i
forgotten
her
in
the
excitement
of
our
sudden
coming
but
now
it
just
takes
me
off
my
feet
to
know
that
we
under
the
same
roof
and
to
remember
that
she
lived
a
whole
summer
in
lloydsboro
valley
and
is
such
a
dear
friend
of
the
little
colonel
and
betty
why
we
to
meet
her
some
time
this
winter
oh
i
know
we
going
to
have
a
good
time
here
and
i
think
that
san
antonio
is
just
the
dearest
most
charming
old
place
in
the
world
it
is
certainly
a
good
place
to
be
answered
jack
following
with
intent
gaze
the
vanishing
figure
of
the
major
pretty
daughter
and
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
the
violins
were
throbbing
through
that
last
refrain
of
so
softly
and
sweetly
that
he
did
not
want
to
lose
a
note
when
it
was
done
mary
took
up
his
last
word
quoting
with
a
dramatic
sweep
of
the
hand
do
thy
worst
for
i
have
lived
chapter
ii
in
search
of
a
home
it
was
with
the
vision
of
a
charming
little
bungalow
in
her
mind
that
mary
started
on
her
search
for
a
house
next
morning
a
little
white
bungalow
half
hidden
in
vines
and
set
among
heuisach
and
mesquite
trees
or
maybe
in
the
shelter
of
one
giant
pecan
as
they
had
whirled
around
the
city
in
the
touring
car
the
day
before
she
had
seen
several
of
that
kind
which
she
thought
would
suit
both
their
taste
and
their
purse
she
had
not
yet
reached
the
point
of
picturing
to
herself
the
inside
furnishings
they
would
have
to
be
of
the
simplest
sort
of
course
but
one
picture
seemed
to
rise
up
of
its
own
accord
whenever
she
thought
of
the
new
home
she
saw
a
big
the
centre
of
a
cheery
hospitality
where
girls
fluttered
in
and
out
at
all
hours
of
the
day
bright
interesting
girls
like
gay
melville
and
roberta
her
wistful
little
face
grew
very
sweet
and
eager
at
the
mere
thought
of
such
companionship
and
there
was
such
a
dancing
light
in
her
gray
eyes
and
such
a
happy
glow
of
expectancy
on
her
cheeks
that
more
than
one
took
a
second
glance
and
felt
the
morning
brighter
because
of
it
ware
had
expected
to
accompany
her
leaving
jack
to
norman
care
for
the
morning
but
a
neuralgic
headache
an
old
enemy
of
hers
seized
her
on
awakening
and
she
was
obliged
to
shift
the
responsibility
to
mary
willing
shoulders
although
it
doubled
the
mary
took
norman
with
her
for
company
armed
with
a
map
of
the
city
and
a
list
of
houses
clipped
from
the
morning
paper
they
started
gaily
out
on
their
quest
it
was
good
just
to
be
alive
on
such
a
morning
and
out
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
with
the
air
so
fresh
and
sweet
and
the
plaza
as
green
and
flowery
as
if
it
were
instead
of
the
week
before
thanksgiving
they
walked
at
first
wanting
a
closer
view
than
the
cars
afforded
of
the
fascinating
old
curio
shops
mexicans
were
no
novelty
to
them
as
they
were
to
northern
tourists
they
had
seen
too
many
in
phoenix
and
at
the
mining
camp
to
care
for
a
second
look
at
the
tall
peaked
hats
of
the
men
or
the
heads
of
the
women
but
the
narrow
streets
of
the
mexican
quarter
with
their
chili
and
tamale
stands
interested
them
it
was
some
kind
of
a
fête
day
and
flags
were
flying
and
a
festive
spirit
was
in
the
air
a
spirit
that
seems
to
belong
peculiarly
to
this
alluring
old
spanish
city
where
fête
days
come
often
and
one
soon
learns
to
say
mañana
with
the
rest
norman
who
picked
up
bits
of
information
here
and
there
as
a
magnet
draws
needles
and
nails
imparted
some
of
it
to
mary
as
he
trudged
along
beside
her
everything
was
making
a
deep
impression
on
his
mind
because
this
was
his
first
journey
of
any
consequence
this
is
the
third
oldest
city
in
the
united
states
the
guide
book
says
he
began
then
paused
before
a
shop
window
attracted
by
the
sign
dressed
fleas
cents
to
exclaim
scornfully
who
be
fool
enough
to
want
one
of
things
dead
or
alive
with
a
skip
or
two
to
catch
up
with
mary
he
continued
and
there
thirteen
miles
of
river
twisting
in
and
out
among
the
streets
with
seventeen
bridges
over
it
it
surely
is
the
twistiest
crookedest
river
that
i
ever
saw
on
a
map
answered
mary
but
that
what
makes
the
town
so
lovely
all
those
graceful
bends
with
the
green
banks
and
tropical
foliage
and
the
little
boats
tied
up
here
and
there
to
the
landings
i
wish
we
could
find
the
kind
of
a
place
we
want
somewhere
along
the
river
maybe
we
could
manage
to
get
a
boat
anyhow
if
we
could
do
any
better
we
could
make
a
raft
i
love
to
pole
one
and
it
would
be
just
like
doing
it
in
our
own
back
yard
if
the
river
ran
right
behind
our
place
say
let
exclaimed
norman
explosively
mary
ware
you
got
a
head
on
you
that
worth
something
and
i
tell
you
something
else
i
wish
we
could
manage
to
do
that
to
get
a
house
out
near
brackenridge
park
they
got
antelope
and
buffalo
and
elk
and
all
sorts
of
wild
animals
out
there
i
like
to
see
them
often
we
better
get
down
to
business
then
said
mary
instead
of
loitering
along
this
way
we
can
look
at
the
shops
after
we
found
a
house
stop
just
a
minute
at
the
alamo
begged
norman
i
want
to
see
the
place
where
travis
and
davy
crockett
and
bowie
put
up
such
a
desperate
fight
against
santa
anna
this
is
just
as
interesting
a
place
to
me
as
bunker
hill
or
plymouth
rock
would
be
and
i
want
to
write
home
to
billy
downs
about
it
but
it
is
the
spot
objected
mary
who
wanted
to
lose
no
more
time
and
was
sometimes
provokingly
literal
this
is
only
the
little
chapel
and
the
real
fight
took
place
in
a
court
that
was
away
over
yonder
and
the
walls
were
pulled
down
long
ago
norman
planted
himself
at
the
entrance
and
proceeded
to
argue
the
matter
but
the
chapel
was
part
of
it
and
it
stands
for
the
whole
thing
now
a
sort
of
monument
you
know
and
there
relics
inside
and
oh
well
come
on
then
said
mary
if
you
anxious
but
just
for
a
minute
you
can
come
here
some
other
time
by
yourself
and
prowl
around
all
day
she
followed
him
into
the
dim
interior
still
insisting
at
every
step
that
they
must
hurry
it
was
so
early
no
one
but
the
was
in
sight
she
knew
how
norman
liked
history
and
what
enthusiastic
admiration
he
had
for
the
heroes
of
frontier
times
but
she
was
surprised
to
see
how
deeply
he
was
impressed
by
the
venerable
building
he
took
off
his
hat
as
they
entered
and
walked
around
as
reverently
as
if
they
were
in
a
church
as
they
gazed
up
at
the
narrow
windows
which
had
witnessed
such
a
desperate
struggle
for
liberty
he
said
in
an
awed
tone
which
made
even
mary
feel
solemn
for
ten
days
took
place
the
most
memorable
thrilling
tragic
and
bloody
siege
in
american
history
one
hundred
and
indomitable
american
frontier
riflemen
against
an
army
of
six
thousand
brave
and
disciplined
troops
led
by
veteran
officers
did
you
get
all
that
demanded
mary
in
surprise
i
saw
it
in
a
little
pamphlet
in
the
last
night
and
it
told
about
the
comanche
indians
that
came
here
about
seventy
years
ago
the
fiercest
fighting
you
ever
heard
of
indian
warriors
killed
right
out
there
in
the
street
that
we
came
across
just
now
and
seven
texans
goodness
norman
she
answered
with
a
shrug
what
do
you
want
to
resurrect
all
those
old
horrors
for
it
does
make
the
place
any
more
attractive
to
me
to
know
that
its
streets
once
ran
red
with
blood
rather
think
of
them
as
they
will
be
in
the
spring
on
san
jacinto
day
red
with
roses
after
the
battle
of
flowers
think
of
our
being
here
to
see
that
she
added
exultingly
as
they
emerged
from
the
chapel
into
the
blinding
sunshine
of
the
street
norman
remarked
thoughtfully
of
course
i
sorry
that
jack
had
the
rheumatism
so
badly
that
he
had
to
get
out
of
lone
rock
but
as
long
as
we
did
have
to
leave
home
i
jolly
glad
it
brought
us
to
san
antonio
think
of
the
times
we
have
going
out
to
fort
sam
houston
to
and
parade
it
something
just
to
be
within
walking
distance
of
the
largest
army
post
of
the
united
states
i
thinking
of
the
public
library
was
her
rejoinder
jack
can
have
all
the
books
he
wants
to
read
this
winter
and
i
thinking
of
the
friends
we
have
the
real
satisfying
kind
that
do
things
and
go
places
and
think
and
keep
you
from
sinking
to
the
level
of
a
cabbage
i
always
wanted
to
live
in
the
thick
of
things
and
here
we
are
at
last
they
paused
on
the
curb
to
wait
for
a
long
string
of
vehicles
to
pass
an
army
ambulance
came
first
drawn
by
sleek
mules
driven
by
a
soldier
in
khaki
and
carrying
several
ladies
and
children
from
the
post
close
behind
it
came
a
riding
party
clattering
in
on
horseback
from
a
breakfast
at
the
country
club
then
followed
close
on
each
heels
a
dilapidated
prairie
schooner
three
boys
on
a
burro
a
huckster
wagon
and
a
carriage
with
liveried
coachman
and
prancing
thoroughbred
horses
the
clang
of
a
long
line
of
electric
cars
whizzing
past
the
honk
of
many
automobiles
and
the
warning
sound
of
bicycle
bells
as
their
owners
wheeled
in
and
out
through
the
bewildering
maze
of
vehicles
and
pedestrians
made
norman
exclaim
joyfully
gee
glad
we
out
of
lone
rock
there
something
to
see
here
every
single
minute
mary
signalled
a
passing
car
and
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
drew
out
her
newspaper
clippings
barnaby
said
for
us
to
go
to
laurel
heights
first
she
remarked
so
i
believe
we
find
it
best
to
try
this
one
it
sounds
all
right
she
read
the
advertisement
aloud
a
bungalow
never
been
occupied
all
modern
conveniences
one
block
from
rent
reasonable
inquire
next
door
then
she
unfolded
the
map
and
studied
it
as
they
whirled
along
now
and
then
repeating
the
name
of
a
street
as
she
came
across
one
which
sounded
particularly
pleasing
and
as
she
called
it
to
norman
king
william
street
mistletoe
avenue
dolorosa
and
san
pedro
when
a
little
later
they
alighted
from
the
car
and
found
the
place
described
in
the
advertisement
it
was
almost
the
bungalow
of
dreams
the
vines
were
lacking
and
the
lawn
was
still
strewn
with
the
débris
of
building
but
that
could
soon
be
remedied
what
good
wide
porches
to
hang
a
hammock
on
exclaimed
norman
as
they
mounted
the
steps
and
walked
around
peering
through
the
windows
you
have
to
say
gallery
corrected
mary
everybody
down
here
calls
a
porch
a
gallery
they
wo
know
what
you
mean
they
walked
all
around
the
house
exclaiming
over
each
attractive
feature
as
each
window
revealed
a
new
one
the
electric
lights
the
convenient
little
bathroom
the
open
in
the
the
china
closet
norman
only
complaint
was
that
the
house
was
nowhere
near
the
river
that
was
a
drawback
in
mary
eyes
also
for
ever
since
they
had
thought
of
a
boat
it
had
begun
to
take
its
place
in
that
mental
picture
in
which
those
alluring
girls
were
always
fluttering
in
and
out
of
course
we
look
farther
she
said
it
would
do
to
take
the
first
one
we
came
to
when
there
are
so
many
to
choose
from
i
just
run
in
next
door
and
inquire
the
price
and
tell
them
we
make
up
our
minds
later
but
when
she
had
made
her
inquiries
her
decision
followed
immediately
what
might
seem
reasonable
rent
to
the
owner
and
to
the
people
of
that
neighborhood
was
entirely
out
of
the
reach
of
the
ware
you
wo
find
anything
cheaper
in
this
part
of
town
the
woman
assured
her
and
after
several
more
experiences
of
the
same
kind
mary
believed
her
they
passed
all
sorts
of
beautiful
homes
in
their
wanderings
stately
colonial
mansions
comfortable
houses
with
broad
galleries
and
hospitable
doors
picturesque
bungalows
in
the
mission
style
little
cottages
with
tangles
of
maréchal
niel
roses
their
fragrant
buds
swinging
from
the
very
eaves
the
farther
they
searched
the
more
mary
longed
to
find
a
home
among
them
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
deep
disappointment
that
she
turned
back
to
the
hotel
for
lunch
ware
had
spent
part
of
the
morning
telephoning
to
different
real
estate
offices
recommended
by
barnaby
and
had
a
small
list
of
houses
sifted
down
from
those
offered
her
they
tell
me
we
are
too
late
to
get
much
of
a
choice
she
reported
people
have
been
pouring
into
the
city
for
a
month
and
the
freight
stations
and
are
piled
up
with
household
goods
it
is
this
way
every
fall
they
say
no
matter
how
many
homes
they
build
there
are
always
more
families
clamoring
to
occupy
them
than
can
be
accommodated
it
would
be
easier
for
us
to
find
one
if
we
could
afford
to
pay
more
but
i
had
to
cut
out
all
the
ones
from
the
lists
that
they
gave
me
mary
took
the
slip
of
paper
from
her
mother
saying
so
far
the
ones
we
have
seen
have
been
too
big
or
too
expensive
or
else
far
too
small
i
wonder
what
will
be
the
matter
with
these
she
began
to
find
out
almost
as
soon
as
she
and
norman
resumed
their
search
again
after
lunch
the
lists
they
had
led
them
into
older
parts
of
the
town
where
the
rented
houses
had
seen
several
generations
of
transitory
occupants
some
of
the
places
they
visited
made
her
shrink
back
in
dismay
a
long
procession
of
careless
tenants
had
passed
through
each
leaving
some
contribution
to
the
evidences
of
their
slack
housekeeping
nearly
every
family
had
had
its
share
of
disease
and
death
and
mary
hurried
away
with
a
wry
face
and
the
single
exclamation
germs
barnaby
had
spoken
of
that
class
of
houses
you
want
to
be
careful
she
told
her
even
the
nicest
looking
may
have
had
dreadfully
sick
tenants
in
them
and
although
there
is
a
law
requiring
landlords
to
fumigate
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
ca
be
sure
that
it
has
been
done
as
thoroughly
as
it
should
this
is
getting
monotonous
mary
exclaimed
wearily
when
they
had
walked
block
after
block
to
no
purpose
and
the
end
of
the
day
found
them
with
nothing
accomplished
the
morning
freshness
of
the
atmosphere
had
given
place
to
such
enervating
heat
that
she
had
been
carrying
her
coat
on
her
arm
for
several
hours
the
sky
was
overcast
with
clouds
when
fagged
and
inwardly
cross
she
climbed
on
the
car
that
was
to
take
them
back
to
the
hotel
vowing
that
she
could
drag
herself
another
step
at
the
next
corner
half
a
dozen
people
hurried
down
the
street
waving
frantically
for
the
car
to
wait
as
they
crowded
into
the
aisle
laughing
and
out
of
breath
mary
heard
a
lady
exclaim
we
certainly
were
lucky
to
catch
this
car
if
we
had
to
wait
for
the
next
one
the
surely
would
have
caught
us
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
nasty
wet
one
too
even
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
sense
of
sudden
chill
in
the
air
a
cold
gale
swept
down
the
street
setting
flags
and
awnings
to
flapping
and
blinding
pedestrians
with
whirling
clouds
of
dust
the
conductor
hurried
to
close
the
car
windows
and
the
passengers
began
struggling
into
their
wraps
the
sudden
freshening
of
the
air
had
such
a
bracing
effect
that
mary
straightened
up
feeling
that
after
all
she
might
be
able
to
walk
the
half
block
from
the
car
to
the
hotel
when
the
time
came
she
found
that
she
could
even
run
the
distance
for
the
few
big
drops
of
rain
that
splashed
in
her
face
were
the
of
a
downpour
and
they
had
no
umbrella
just
as
they
reached
the
entrance
such
a
mighty
deluge
began
that
mary
disappointment
in
was
somewhat
softened
by
the
fact
that
her
beloved
hat
had
escaped
a
wetting
which
must
have
ruined
it
never
mind
little
vicar
said
jack
consolingly
when
she
had
made
her
report
to
the
assembled
family
the
proverbial
turn
in
our
fortune
is
bound
to
come
it
never
failed
us
yet
you
know
but
we
simply
got
to
get
out
of
this
expensive
hotel
she
answered
desperately
do
you
realize
that
we
could
keep
house
for
a
week
on
what
it
costs
the
four
of
us
to
stay
here
just
one
day
ware
broke
the
long
silence
that
followed
by
suggesting
maybe
for
the
present
we
better
try
to
get
a
few
rooms
somewhere
just
for
light
housekeeping
it
a
last
resort
i
know
but
mary
is
right
every
day
we
spend
here
is
taking
a
big
mouthful
out
of
our
little
capital
nobody
liked
the
suggestion
for
whatever
else
they
had
lacked
in
their
arizona
homes
there
had
been
no
lack
of
space
but
they
all
saw
the
wisdom
of
ware
suggestion
and
agreed
to
try
it
until
they
could
look
around
and
do
better
how
lovely
it
must
be
to
have
an
ancestral
thought
mary
that
night
as
she
tossed
restlessly
kept
awake
by
the
noises
of
the
big
hotel
i
ca
think
of
anything
more
heavenly
than
to
always
live
in
the
house
where
you
were
born
and
your
fathers
and
grandfathers
before
you
as
the
lloyds
do
at
the
locusts
it
must
be
so
delightful
to
feel
that
you
got
an
attic
full
of
heirlooms
and
that
everything
about
the
place
is
connected
with
some
old
family
tradition
and
to
know
that
you
can
take
root
there
and
not
have
to
go
wandering
around
from
pillar
to
post
as
we
wares
have
always
had
to
do
i
wonder
if
lloyd
sherman
knows
how
much
she
has
to
be
thankful
for
next
day
in
her
shortest
skirt
and
and
under
a
dripping
umbrella
mary
started
to
look
for
rooms
she
was
alone
this
time
company
was
too
expensive
a
luxury
to
afford
more
than
one
day
since
it
meant
extra
she
paddled
blithely
off
however
never
minding
the
weather
this
rain
made
the
little
home
she
was
seeking
seem
all
the
more
desirable
whenever
a
window
showed
her
a
cozy
interior
with
the
light
of
an
open
fire
shining
cheerily
over
it
she
thought
it
would
not
be
long
till
she
would
be
making
afternoon
tea
over
just
such
a
fire
or
popping
corn
or
toasting
she
could
think
of
a
dozen
ways
to
make
it
attractive
for
the
girls
when
they
dropped
in
of
rainy
afternoons
occupied
with
such
plans
she
tramped
along
through
the
mud
and
slush
as
happily
as
she
had
gone
through
the
sunshine
the
day
before
but
by
the
end
of
the
morning
repeated
failures
began
to
bring
a
worried
line
between
her
eyes
and
a
sharp
note
of
anxiety
into
her
voice
when
she
made
her
inquiries
once
finding
herself
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
house
which
she
had
refused
the
day
before
because
it
did
not
quite
measure
up
to
the
standards
she
had
set
she
went
to
look
at
it
again
thinking
after
all
they
might
manage
to
be
more
comfortable
in
it
than
in
a
few
rooms
to
her
disappointment
she
found
a
family
already
moving
in
it
had
been
rented
almost
immediately
after
her
refusal
to
take
it
in
her
search
for
rooms
a
new
difficulty
faced
her
invariably
one
of
the
first
questions
asked
her
was
anyone
sick
in
your
family
yes
my
brother
she
would
say
he
has
rheumatism
that
is
why
we
are
particular
about
getting
a
sunny
south
room
for
him
well
we
ca
take
sick
people
would
be
the
positive
answer
and
she
would
turn
away
with
an
ache
in
her
throat
and
a
dull
wonder
why
rheumatism
could
make
him
objectionable
in
the
slightest
degree
as
a
tenant
the
morning
was
nearly
gone
before
she
found
the
reason
she
was
shown
into
a
dingy
parlor
by
a
child
of
the
family
and
asked
to
wait
a
few
moments
its
mother
had
gone
around
the
corner
to
the
bakery
but
would
be
right
back
there
were
two
others
already
waiting
when
mary
entered
the
room
a
stout
woman
and
a
girl
the
woman
looked
up
with
a
nod
as
mary
took
a
chair
near
the
stove
and
spread
out
her
damp
skirts
to
dry
i
reckon
you
on
the
same
errand
as
us
said
the
woman
but
first
come
first
served
and
we
ahead
of
you
yes
answered
mary
distantly
polite
and
wondering
at
the
aggressive
tone
when
the
child
left
the
room
the
woman
rose
and
shut
the
door
behind
it
and
then
came
back
to
mary
lowering
her
voice
confidentially
it
just
this
way
we
getting
desperate
we
came
down
here
for
my
daughter
health
the
doctor
sent
us
and
we
gone
all
over
town
trying
to
get
some
kind
of
roof
over
our
heads
we
ca
get
in
anywhere
because
maudie
has
lung
trouble
people
have
been
coming
down
here
for
forty
years
to
get
cured
of
it
and
folks
were
glad
enough
to
rent
rooms
and
take
their
money
till
all
this
talk
was
stirred
up
in
the
papers
about
lung
trouble
being
a
great
white
plague
and
catching
and
all
that
now
you
ca
get
in
anywhere
at
a
price
that
poor
folks
can
pay
i
come
to
the
end
of
my
rope
the
landlady
at
the
where
we
been
stopping
told
me
this
morning
that
she
could
keep
us
another
day
because
the
boarders
complained
when
they
found
what
ailed
maudie
i
was
a
fool
to
tell
for
she
does
cough
much
only
in
the
first
stages
after
this
i
just
going
to
say
that
i
came
down
here
to
look
for
work
and
goodness
knows
the
truth
what
i
want
to
ask
of
you
is
that
you
wo
stand
in
the
way
of
our
getting
in
here
by
offering
more
rent
or
anything
like
that
certainly
not
mary
answered
drawing
back
a
little
almost
intimidated
by
the
fierceness
which
desperation
gave
to
the
manner
the
landlady
bustled
in
at
that
moment
and
as
she
threw
the
rooms
open
for
inspection
she
asked
the
question
that
mary
had
heard
so
often
that
morning
any
sick
in
your
family
no
answered
the
woman
glibly
i
down
in
the
city
looking
for
work
i
do
plain
sewing
and
if
you
know
of
any
likely
customers
i
be
glad
if
you
mention
me
the
landlady
glanced
shrewdly
at
maudie
who
kept
in
the
background
she
does
embroidery
explained
her
mother
makes
her
a
little
pale
and
peaked
sitting
over
it
so
long
i
ai
going
to
let
her
do
so
much
after
i
once
get
a
good
start
well
a
person
in
my
place
ca
be
too
careful
complained
the
landlady
we
get
taken
in
so
often
letting
our
rooms
to
strangers
they
have
all
sorts
of
names
for
lung
trouble
nowadays
malaria
and
a
weak
heart
and
such
things
the
couple
i
had
in
here
last
said
it
was
just
indigestion
and
shortness
of
breath
but
she
died
all
the
same
six
weeks
later
in
this
very
room
and
he
had
to
acknowledge
it
was
her
lungs
all
the
time
and
he
knew
it
mary
looked
around
the
room
with
a
shiver
its
old
wallpaper
dingy
paint
and
worn
carpet
proclaimed
too
plainly
that
its
renovation
since
the
last
lodgers
departure
had
been
only
a
superficial
one
barely
what
the
law
demanded
no
thank
you
she
replied
to
the
landlady
who
had
turned
to
her
with
the
hope
of
finding
a
more
desirable
tenant
i
could
consider
these
rooms
at
all
there
are
only
two
and
we
need
three
at
least
out
on
the
street
again
a
tear
or
two
splashed
down
and
mingled
with
the
rain
on
her
face
as
she
walked
away
she
was
growing
desperate
herself
if
two
rooms
had
been
all
they
needed
she
could
have
found
them
a
number
of
times
over
or
if
they
could
have
afforded
some
of
the
flats
or
the
sunny
suites
she
discovered
on
pleasant
streets
her
search
would
have
been
soon
over
but
it
was
the
same
old
circle
she
kept
coming
back
to
when
the
rooms
were
large
enough
and
within
their
means
either
they
were
unsanitary
or
the
owners
objected
to
invalids
in
vain
she
explained
that
jack
helplessness
was
due
to
an
accident
and
that
rheumatism
is
not
contagious
too
many
people
like
maudie
mother
had
been
ahead
of
her
and
bred
suspicion
of
all
strangers
in
quest
of
rooms
for
light
housekeeping
mary
had
told
her
mother
not
to
expect
her
back
for
lunch
she
would
go
into
some
or
restaurant
wherever
she
happened
to
be
but
one
found
her
in
a
part
of
the
town
where
nothing
of
the
kind
was
in
sight
she
bought
an
apple
and
some
crackers
at
a
grocery
and
ate
them
under
cover
of
her
umbrella
while
she
stood
on
a
corner
waiting
for
a
car
to
take
her
to
another
part
of
the
city
what
a
different
place
it
seemed
to
be
from
the
one
they
had
seen
the
day
of
their
arrival
then
it
was
a
world
of
hospitable
homes
and
sunshine
and
kindly
faces
the
very
shop
windows
looked
friendly
and
inviting
now
plodding
along
in
the
wet
to
the
tired
homesick
girl
it
seemed
only
a
great
desolate
place
full
of
lonely
discouraged
strangers
and
sick
people
and
dingy
whose
doors
shut
coldly
in
anxious
faces
all
afternoon
she
kept
up
the
search
the
electric
lights
were
beginning
to
gleam
through
the
rain
throwing
long
quivering
reflections
in
the
puddles
when
she
finally
turned
back
to
the
hotel
bedraggled
and
utterly
discouraged
i
cry
she
said
fiercely
to
herself
i
ca
for
jack
would
see
that
i
had
been
at
it
and
he
is
getting
so
sensitive
lately
it
would
hurt
him
dreadfully
to
know
that
we
are
barred
out
of
all
the
desirable
places
because
he
is
an
invalid
the
habit
of
years
is
strong
mary
had
persisted
so
long
in
applying
the
good
vicar
of
wakefield
motto
to
her
childish
difficulties
and
disappointments
that
it
had
taught
her
remarkable
instead
of
bursting
impulsively
into
the
room
as
so
many
girls
of
her
age
would
have
done
and
giving
vent
to
her
nerves
and
discouragement
in
a
tearful
report
of
the
day
adventures
she
walked
slowly
from
the
elevator
to
her
room
trying
to
think
of
some
careless
way
in
which
to
announce
her
failure
she
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
thinking
i
just
tell
them
that
i
come
back
like
noah
dove
did
the
first
time
it
was
sent
out
from
the
ark
because
i
could
find
no
rest
for
the
sole
of
my
foot
at
least
a
rest
which
fitted
both
our
ideas
and
our
income
to
her
relief
the
room
was
empty
when
she
entered
the
only
light
streamed
through
the
transom
and
keyhole
from
jack
room
where
a
low
murmur
told
that
her
mother
was
reading
aloud
opening
the
door
just
a
crack
so
that
her
face
was
not
visible
she
called
gaily
i
back
mamma
but
you
can
just
go
on
with
your
reading
i
not
tell
a
single
thing
till
i
all
dried
and
dressed
i
as
wet
as
a
frog
oh
i
was
afraid
you
be
came
the
anxious
answer
i
come
and
get
no
interrupted
mary
decidedly
i
do
want
anything
but
time
closing
the
door
between
the
rooms
she
switched
on
the
light
and
began
slipping
out
of
her
wet
clothes
into
dry
ones
in
a
moment
or
two
she
was
in
her
soft
warm
kimona
and
turkish
slippers
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
bathroom
intending
to
plunge
her
face
into
a
basin
of
hot
water
it
was
the
best
thing
she
could
think
of
to
remove
the
traces
of
tears
and
she
was
so
tired
that
now
she
was
safe
in
the
harbor
of
her
own
room
the
tears
come
no
matter
how
hard
she
tried
to
keep
them
back
but
before
she
could
turn
the
faucet
a
tap
at
the
hall
door
made
her
dab
her
handkerchief
hastily
across
her
eyes
for
barnaby
voice
followed
the
tap
i
surely
hate
to
trouble
you
she
began
apologetically
as
soon
as
mary
had
admitted
her
but
if
you
could
only
hook
me
up
this
one
more
time
i
been
waiting
for
james
with
this
shawl
over
my
shoulders
for
nearly
half
an
hour
then
i
heard
you
come
in
and
i
thought
maybe
you
would
mind
doing
it
once
more
we
going
home
in
the
morning
then
with
a
keen
look
into
mary
face
she
added
kindly
why
you
poor
child
what
the
matter
your
brother
is
worse
i
hope
there
was
such
a
note
of
real
concern
in
the
sympathetic
voice
that
mary
lip
trembled
and
her
eyes
brimmed
over
again
when
the
next
moment
she
found
herself
drawn
into
barnaby
capacious
embrace
with
a
plump
hand
patting
her
soothingly
on
the
back
the
story
of
her
discouragement
seemed
to
sob
itself
out
of
its
own
accord
the
performance
left
mary
eyes
very
red
and
but
the
outburst
brought
such
relief
that
she
could
laugh
the
moment
it
was
over
it
was
barnaby
surprise
which
brought
the
laugh
i
ca
get
over
it
she
kept
exclaiming
to
think
that
all
this
time
i
supposed
that
you
were
enormously
wealthy
actually
rolling
in
riches
well
well
i
did
know
that
my
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
would
be
so
upsetting
giggled
mary
hysterically
you
were
so
sweet
and
sympathetic
i
could
help
telling
you
but
do
take
it
to
heart
please
we
wares
never
stay
discouraged
long
i
be
all
right
now
after
i
get
my
face
washed
as
soon
as
i
fasten
your
dress
i
run
in
and
turn
on
the
hot
water
the
hooking
proceeded
in
silence
barnaby
so
absorbed
in
thought
that
she
forgot
her
usual
sigh
of
relief
and
expression
of
thanks
at
the
end
instead
she
said
abruptly
you
come
and
go
up
on
the
train
with
us
in
the
morning
to
bauer
it
only
thirty
miles
from
here
and
it
up
in
the
hills
high
and
dry
and
there
the
metz
cottage
i
sure
you
can
get
all
freshly
scrubbed
and
ready
to
move
into
metz
is
the
cleanest
little
german
woman
you
ever
saw
scrubs
even
the
under
sides
of
her
tables
as
white
as
the
tops
it
was
rented
when
we
came
down
here
last
saturday
let
me
talk
to
your
mother
about
it
i
sure
it
is
just
the
place
for
you
oh
no
began
mary
we
could
possibly
go
there
we
counted
so
much
on
living
here
in
san
antonio
this
winter
and
meeting
some
of
our
friends
friends
then
she
stopped
with
a
little
gasp
and
after
an
instant
pause
said
apologetically
i
did
mean
to
refuse
so
abruptly
and
now
i
take
it
all
back
changing
plans
so
suddenly
is
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
system
is
it
after
all
i
like
a
drowning
man
catching
at
straws
and
i
be
very
glad
indeed
if
you
would
talk
to
mamma
about
it
you
can
go
right
in
now
while
i
finish
dressing
if
you
like
it
was
not
the
first
time
barnaby
had
been
ushered
into
room
their
acquaintance
had
begun
over
the
railing
of
their
adjoining
balconies
the
first
day
of
mary
and
had
rapidly
deepened
into
a
mutual
liking
so
strongly
had
barnaby
been
attracted
to
the
young
fellow
who
bore
his
crippled
condition
so
lightly
that
he
made
others
forget
it
that
she
induced
james
to
go
in
and
make
his
acquaintance
also
the
two
men
had
spent
several
hours
of
the
long
rainy
morning
together
each
greatly
interested
in
the
conversation
mary
who
had
been
gone
all
day
did
not
know
of
this
but
she
knew
that
her
mother
had
met
and
liked
barnaby
and
that
the
story
of
the
day
unsuccessful
search
would
not
sound
half
so
serious
if
that
cheerful
old
lady
told
it
especially
if
it
were
followed
immediately
by
her
offer
to
find
them
a
home
in
bauer
bauer
was
an
uncharted
country
on
mary
map
but
if
barnaby
thought
of
it
as
their
desired
haven
she
could
trust
her
capable
hands
to
take
them
safely
into
it
so
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
she
opened
the
door
between
the
rooms
saying
here
barnaby
mamma
and
left
her
to
make
explanations
while
she
finished
dressing
chapter
iii
the
little
town
of
bauer
mary
was
the
only
one
to
whom
the
change
of
plans
made
a
vital
difference
she
had
built
such
lovely
of
their
winter
in
san
antonio
that
it
was
hard
to
see
them
destroyed
at
one
breath
of
course
it
the
only
thing
to
do
she
said
in
a
mournful
aside
to
norman
but
did
you
ever
dream
that
there
was
a
dish
of
rare
delicious
fruit
set
down
in
front
of
you
so
tempting
that
you
could
hardly
wait
to
taste
it
and
just
as
you
put
out
your
hand
it
was
suddenly
snatched
away
that
the
way
i
feel
about
leaving
here
and
i
dreamed
of
getting
letters
too
big
fat
letters
that
were
somehow
going
to
change
my
whole
life
for
the
better
and
then
just
as
i
started
to
read
them
i
always
woke
up
and
so
never
found
out
the
secret
that
would
make
such
a
change
in
my
fortunes
maybe
it
wo
be
so
bad
after
all
encouraged
norman
maybe
we
can
have
a
boat
there
a
creek
running
through
the
town
and
the
barnaby
ranch
is
only
seven
miles
out
in
the
country
we
see
them
often
mary
wanted
to
wail
out
oh
it
is
boats
and
ranches
and
old
people
i
want
it
girls
and
boys
and
something
doing
being
in
the
heart
of
things
as
we
would
be
if
we
could
only
stay
here
in
this
beautiful
old
city
the
wail
found
no
voice
however
for
even
in
the
midst
of
her
disappointment
mary
remembered
jack
and
could
not
let
him
feel
that
this
change
in
their
plans
meant
any
sacrifice
for
her
besides
she
had
to
acknowledge
that
the
creek
and
the
ranch
hold
out
some
compensations
and
she
was
deeply
grateful
to
these
two
kind
old
people
who
had
come
to
their
rescue
in
such
cordial
neighborly
fashion
barnaby
had
been
called
into
the
family
council
also
and
had
spent
the
evening
with
them
discussing
prices
and
prospects
even
norman
was
impressed
by
their
offers
of
assistance
and
spoke
of
it
as
he
sat
slowly
unlacing
his
shoes
after
they
had
gone
mary
was
in
the
next
room
repacking
her
trunk
for
it
had
been
decided
that
she
and
norman
were
to
go
to
bauer
on
the
early
accommodation
train
when
the
barnabys
left
for
home
the
door
between
the
rooms
was
still
open
and
she
heard
him
say
thoughtfully
what
do
you
suppose
makes
them
so
rattling
good
to
us
when
we
just
strangers
jack
laughed
and
quoted
teasingly
makes
the
lamb
love
mary
so
the
eager
children
cry
mary
loves
the
lamb
you
know
the
teacher
did
reply
aw
talk
sense
was
norman
disgusted
answer
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
an
understanding
smile
flashed
between
jack
and
his
mother
who
had
stayed
to
help
him
prepare
for
the
night
and
she
answered
for
him
jack
only
means
that
we
get
just
what
we
give
in
this
world
dear
from
the
days
of
solomon
it
been
a
proverb
that
the
man
who
would
have
friends
show
himself
friendly
and
that
what
you
and
mary
did
the
first
night
you
met
the
barnabys
you
made
them
feel
that
you
found
them
genuinely
interesting
and
that
awakened
a
liking
for
you
but
anybody
find
that
old
man
interesting
norman
explained
gravely
you
never
heard
such
indian
stories
as
he
can
tell
true
ones
that
he
been
in
himself
and
hunting
gee
you
ought
to
hear
him
i
bid
to
sit
next
to
him
going
up
on
the
train
you
welcome
to
him
called
mary
i
take
mrs
b
then
she
came
to
the
doorway
a
pile
of
folded
garments
in
her
hands
i
declare
she
just
an
old
dear
she
thought
of
so
many
ways
to
save
us
expense
since
she
found
out
that
we
have
to
economize
she
even
offered
to
have
our
two
extra
trunks
checked
on
their
tickets
they
only
brought
so
we
have
no
extra
baggage
to
pay
for
the
sun
was
shining
next
morning
and
although
the
chill
of
the
norther
was
still
in
the
air
the
plazas
were
greener
than
ever
and
new
roses
were
opening
to
take
the
places
of
the
old
ones
that
the
storm
had
beaten
off
the
day
before
mary
spirits
seemed
to
have
passed
through
the
same
freshening
process
for
there
was
no
trace
of
tears
or
regrets
on
the
bright
face
that
greeted
her
travelling
companions
the
only
morning
train
was
an
accommodation
which
carried
much
freight
and
took
its
own
time
for
the
journey
this
happened
to
be
a
day
when
it
was
four
hours
on
the
road
but
none
of
the
little
party
felt
that
time
dragged
ordinarily
mary
would
have
enjoyed
keeping
close
to
the
old
ranchman
as
norman
did
hopping
off
the
car
every
time
they
stopped
on
a
to
investigate
everything
along
the
way
the
lime
works
the
rock
quarry
the
station
where
the
mail
was
put
off
for
the
soldiers
who
were
camped
at
the
government
reservation
for
target
practise
even
the
little
engine
would
have
been
of
as
much
interest
to
her
as
it
was
to
norman
had
she
not
been
so
busily
occupied
otherwise
as
they
wound
higher
and
higher
into
the
hills
she
looked
out
now
and
then
with
a
quick
exclamation
of
pleasure
at
the
view
but
for
the
most
part
she
was
visiting
with
barnaby
as
that
good
soul
expressed
it
their
acquaintance
took
long
strides
forward
that
morning
part
of
the
time
mary
chattered
along
just
as
if
her
listener
had
been
one
of
the
warwick
hall
girls
and
part
of
the
time
she
listened
to
elderly
views
and
confidences
with
the
seeming
sympathy
of
middle
age
a
bit
of
personal
history
from
one
called
out
a
corresponding
scrap
from
the
other
and
they
had
exchanged
views
on
many
subjects
ranging
from
young
turkeys
to
unhappy
marriages
when
the
porter
passed
through
the
train
calling
bauer
all
out
for
bauer
barnaby
glanced
out
the
window
saying
in
surprise
i
had
no
idea
we
were
so
near
home
then
she
gave
mary
sleeve
an
affectionate
little
pat
with
her
plump
hand
exclaiming
cordially
i
declare
been
a
real
treat
to
have
you
along
and
mary
as
she
helped
barnaby
struggle
into
her
coat
responded
well
i
enjoyed
every
inch
of
the
way
somehow
you
make
me
feel
that
you
just
my
age
or
just
yours
i
do
know
which
you
ca
imagine
how
and
i
feel
at
the
thought
of
leaving
you
oh
but
i
not
going
to
leave
you
until
you
safely
settled
was
the
comforting
assurance
james
has
some
business
at
the
that
will
keep
him
in
town
for
an
hour
or
so
as
soon
as
we
drop
him
there
i
drive
around
with
you
to
make
arrangements
about
the
cottage
there
pedro
now
they
were
on
the
platform
by
this
time
and
she
indicated
by
a
nod
the
slim
young
mexican
who
had
driven
the
carriage
from
the
ranch
to
meet
them
it
was
a
roomy
carriage
drawn
by
two
big
gray
mules
with
much
shining
on
their
stout
black
harness
the
station
was
half
a
mile
away
from
the
village
and
as
they
swung
down
the
sunny
white
road
towards
it
at
a
rapid
gait
both
norman
and
mary
looked
out
eagerly
at
the
place
that
was
to
be
their
home
for
a
whole
long
winter
and
maybe
more
from
a
distance
it
looked
almost
like
a
toy
village
with
its
red
roofs
blue
barns
and
flashing
windmills
nestled
against
the
background
of
misty
hills
low
mountain
peaks
rose
here
and
there
on
the
far
horizon
beyond
this
is
distinctly
a
german
village
you
know
explained
barnaby
as
they
passed
a
group
of
little
teutons
on
the
roadside
who
were
calling
to
each
other
and
their
dog
in
a
tongue
which
mary
could
not
understand
bauer
was
settled
by
an
old
german
count
and
a
baron
or
two
who
came
over
here
with
their
families
and
followers
they
made
it
as
much
like
a
corner
of
the
fatherland
as
they
could
and
their
descendants
still
cling
to
their
language
and
customs
they
do
want
any
disturbing
aggressive
americans
in
their
midst
so
they
never
call
on
and
never
return
their
visits
if
any
of
them
try
to
make
the
advances
they
will
welcome
you
to
their
shops
but
not
to
their
homes
even
the
english
and
scotch
people
who
have
owned
the
ranches
as
long
as
they
have
owned
the
town
are
looked
upon
as
aliens
and
strangers
in
a
way
illustration
mary
ware
in
texas
a
dashing
girl
in
khaki
and
a
cowboy
hat
astride
of
a
fiery
little
mustang
mary
gave
an
exclamation
of
dismay
texas
certainly
is
full
of
surprises
she
said
in
a
disappointed
tone
one
thinks
of
it
as
being
young
and
crude
and
with
the
proverbial
hospitality
of
a
new
country
i
always
thought
of
it
as
having
the
out
for
everybody
oh
has
barnaby
hastened
to
assure
her
its
doors
are
wide
open
and
its
welcome
corresponds
to
its
size
the
biggest
in
the
union
but
bauer
is
different
it
has
a
few
families
who
will
not
look
on
you
with
suspicion
the
old
couple
who
own
the
cottage
which
i
hope
to
get
for
you
will
be
good
neighbors
and
if
you
were
to
live
here
a
long
time
there
are
others
who
would
be
friendly
then
there
are
several
american
families
who
have
found
a
foothold
in
the
town
and
as
i
said
people
on
the
ranches
hereabout
they
are
cultured
refined
people
interesting
to
know
but
strangers
coming
here
rarely
make
their
acquaintance
you
see
we
have
so
many
transients
coming
for
their
health
staying
just
a
few
weeks
or
months
and
going
on
again
it
hardly
to
be
expected
we
her
sentence
was
interrupted
by
a
dashing
girl
in
khaki
and
a
cowboy
hat
astride
a
fiery
little
mustang
she
rode
past
the
carriage
calling
out
a
greeting
as
she
passed
norman
turned
around
exclaiming
did
you
see
that
a
cartridge
belt
around
her
waist
and
a
in
her
holster
that
the
wild
west
for
you
that
the
sheriff
daughter
explained
barnaby
she
his
deputy
and
meets
the
trains
when
it
necessary
and
he
out
of
town
i
like
to
know
her
said
mary
i
glad
that
there
something
to
give
one
the
kind
of
a
thrill
you
naturally
expect
to
have
out
here
i
was
beginning
to
have
such
a
foreign
feeling
seeing
all
these
picturesque
little
german
gardens
with
old
women
weeding
in
them
we
can
imagine
we
are
abroad
this
winter
in
cologne
or
pottsdam
or
bingen
on
the
rhine
oh
how
quaint
and
dear
the
exclamation
escaped
her
as
the
gray
mules
stopped
at
the
gate
of
an
old
garden
over
whose
stone
walls
arched
a
row
of
great
pecan
trees
a
straight
path
ran
from
the
gate
to
the
kitchen
door
stiffly
bordered
by
coxcombs
and
princes
feather
while
on
each
side
chrysanthemums
and
roses
and
a
host
of
autumn
flowers
made
the
little
plot
a
tangle
of
colors
and
sweet
smells
there
were
some
under
the
bare
peach
trees
and
at
one
side
beyond
them
a
small
vineyard
where
the
mockingbirds
still
sang
noisily
although
the
grapes
had
all
been
gathered
and
pressed
into
wine
an
old
man
with
a
flowing
white
beard
and
a
high
black
hat
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
kitchen
door
placidly
smoking
a
long
pipe
that
metz
said
barnaby
preparing
to
alight
come
in
with
me
it
all
just
like
one
of
the
pictures
in
joyce
studio
commented
mary
as
they
followed
the
straight
walk
to
the
door
and
this
is
just
like
one
of
those
lovely
dutch
interiors
she
added
in
a
whisper
as
metz
ushered
them
into
the
big
clean
kitchen
where
his
wife
sat
knitting
on
the
deep
a
cat
lay
asleep
in
the
sun
beside
a
pot
of
glowing
red
geraniums
and
there
was
such
an
air
of
cleanliness
and
thrift
and
repose
about
the
room
that
mary
could
not
help
exclaiming
aloud
over
it
as
she
glanced
around
with
admiring
glances
her
bright
face
showed
its
appreciation
also
and
metz
watched
it
shrewdly
while
she
talked
with
barnaby
in
english
so
broken
as
to
be
almost
unintelligible
what
the
old
woman
saw
must
have
satisfied
her
for
she
accepted
barnaby
offer
after
a
very
short
parley
with
her
husband
in
german
and
when
they
rose
to
go
she
bade
them
wait
while
she
made
a
stiff
little
nosegay
for
each
of
them
culled
from
her
garden
borders
and
edged
with
mint
in
the
center
of
mary
was
one
of
her
handsomest
coxcombs
barnaby
smiled
meaningly
when
she
saw
it
and
when
they
had
climbed
back
into
the
carriage
said
in
a
pleased
tone
that
shows
that
she
has
weighed
you
in
the
balance
and
is
satisfied
with
the
result
you
get
along
famously
with
her
i
sure
and
soon
have
you
settled
now
in
fine
shape
an
hour
later
mary
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
cottage
she
had
rented
with
the
keys
of
possession
in
her
hand
thanks
to
barnaby
and
the
rapid
gait
of
the
gray
mules
much
had
been
accomplished
in
that
time
the
groceries
they
had
ordered
were
already
piled
on
the
table
in
the
kitchen
a
load
of
wood
was
on
its
way
the
new
mattresses
they
had
bought
at
the
furniture
shop
kept
by
the
undertaker
of
the
village
were
promised
for
delivery
early
in
the
afternoon
and
they
had
been
introduced
at
each
place
as
friends
of
the
barnabys
who
were
to
be
charged
home
prices
and
not
the
ones
usually
asked
of
strangers
barnaby
was
what
she
called
and
although
she
made
a
jest
of
her
demands
they
carried
weight
their
trunks
three
of
which
contained
bedclothes
and
dishes
stood
on
the
front
gallery
waiting
to
be
unpacked
inside
the
house
looked
as
clean
as
soapsuds
and
fresh
paint
could
make
it
metz
herself
had
attended
to
the
scrubbing
after
the
last
tenant
left
but
mary
decided
that
she
would
feel
more
comfortable
moving
in
after
strangers
if
she
should
give
the
furniture
a
personal
washing
before
they
began
to
use
it
while
norman
built
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
stove
she
unlocked
one
of
the
trunks
and
changed
her
travelling
suit
for
a
gingham
dress
and
apron
let
eat
picnic
fashion
called
norman
and
unpack
afterward
nearly
one
and
i
too
hungry
to
wait
i
found
a
cup
i
can
boil
some
eggs
in
and
if
we
do
use
any
dishes
we
wo
have
any
to
wash
afterwards
that
a
bright
suggestion
mary
called
back
we
have
any
time
to
lose
if
we
are
to
get
everything
ready
for
mamma
and
jack
by
afternoon
when
she
came
dancing
out
into
the
kitchen
a
few
minutes
later
norman
had
already
begun
his
luncheon
and
was
walking
around
with
a
cheese
sandwich
in
one
hand
and
a
pickle
in
the
other
investigating
the
premises
while
he
ate
mary
followed
his
example
and
wandered
from
the
open
doorway
to
the
open
windows
looking
at
the
view
from
each
and
exclaiming
over
each
new
discovery
the
house
was
on
a
slight
knoll
with
a
wide
stretching
down
between
it
and
the
little
village
from
this
distance
it
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
toy
village
against
the
background
of
low
hills
you
ought
to
see
it
from
the
top
of
the
windmill
said
norman
i
climbed
up
while
you
and
barnaby
were
talking
so
long
at
the
gate
i
glad
we
got
a
windmill
it
save
me
a
lot
of
pumping
and
it
makes
such
a
fine
you
ought
to
see
how
far
you
can
look
across
the
country
you
can
see
the
creek
it
just
a
little
way
back
of
our
place
i
going
up
this
minute
answered
mary
slipping
her
unfinished
sandwiches
into
her
apron
pocket
she
ran
out
to
the
windmill
and
began
to
swing
herself
from
one
of
the
tower
to
another
as
lightly
as
norman
had
done
it
perfectly
lovely
she
called
back
from
the
top
i
like
to
perch
up
here
all
afternoon
if
there
was
so
much
to
do
i
going
to
come
up
here
often
it
gives
you
such
a
feeling
there
peter
she
called
over
at
the
south
end
of
town
i
recognize
the
little
stone
belfry
what
do
you
suppose
that
square
tower
is
at
the
other
end
of
town
norman
came
out
and
climbed
up
the
windmill
swinging
there
below
her
by
one
arm
as
he
slowly
munched
a
oh
that
he
said
as
he
looked
in
the
direction
which
she
pointed
that
the
sisters
school
i
asked
pedro
this
morning
it
the
academy
of
the
holy
angels
mary
face
glowed
as
she
shook
back
the
hair
which
the
wind
kept
blowing
into
her
eyes
that
perfectly
fascinating
she
declared
there
something
beautiful
to
me
in
the
thought
that
the
little
town
we
come
to
lies
between
two
such
guardians
it
a
good
omen
and
not
sorry
now
that
we
had
to
come
she
stayed
perched
on
the
windmill
enjoying
the
view
and
eating
her
sandwiches
until
norman
called
her
that
the
was
boiling
over
on
the
stove
then
she
climbed
nimbly
down
and
started
towards
the
kitchen
door
the
kitchen
was
in
an
ell
of
the
house
and
from
its
front
window
she
could
see
the
road
which
ran
in
front
of
the
house
just
across
it
half
hidden
by
a
row
of
bushy
umbrella
trees
stood
two
little
blue
cottages
they
were
within
easy
calling
distance
and
the
voices
of
half
a
dozen
children
at
play
came
cheerfully
across
to
her
although
they
spoke
in
a
foreign
tongue
the
chatter
gave
her
a
sense
of
companionship
norman
she
suddenly
suggested
let
stay
here
instead
of
going
to
the
as
mamma
and
barnaby
arranged
i
not
afraid
with
neighbors
so
near
and
i
sure
mamma
would
care
if
she
could
see
how
quiet
and
peaceful
it
is
here
we
be
saving
considerable
a
night
lodging
for
two
and
we
can
make
this
real
comfortable
and
homey
by
bedtime
with
the
promise
of
hot
biscuit
and
honey
for
supper
norman
agreed
to
her
plan
he
was
to
call
at
the
and
cancel
the
arrangements
barnaby
had
made
for
them
when
he
went
for
the
milk
which
metz
had
promised
to
sell
them
it
was
from
the
metz
they
were
to
have
the
honey
too
she
had
engaged
it
as
a
special
treat
for
jack
under
her
direction
norman
fell
to
work
making
a
kitchen
cabinet
out
of
two
old
boxes
while
she
scrubbed
away
at
the
chairs
and
tables
is
it
funny
the
way
history
repeats
itself
she
remarked
this
makes
me
think
of
the
time
that
joyce
and
jack
had
getting
settled
in
the
wigwam
i
felt
so
defrauded
then
because
i
could
have
a
hand
in
it
and
this
seems
a
sort
of
compensation
for
what
i
missed
then
the
exercise
seemed
to
loosen
her
tongue
for
as
she
worked
she
went
on
i
truly
glad
that
i
can
enjoy
both
the
top
and
bottom
crusts
of
things
nobody
i
am
sure
could
have
squeezed
more
pleasure
out
of
this
last
week
than
i
did
i
fairly
revelled
in
all
the
luxuries
we
had
as
robeson
guests
it
comes
so
easy
to
be
waited
on
and
to
be
the
fine
lady
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
real
joy
to
be
working
this
way
blacking
stoves
and
filling
lamps
and
making
things
look
spick
and
span
i
can
spend
like
a
lord
and
i
can
skimp
like
a
scrubwoman
and
i
really
do
know
which
i
enjoy
most
she
did
not
attempt
to
put
any
finishing
touches
to
the
house
that
day
but
left
such
things
as
the
hanging
of
curtains
and
the
few
pictures
they
had
brought
until
next
morning
but
before
she
stopped
everything
was
shining
her
room
was
ready
for
the
night
and
a
cot
was
made
up
for
norman
in
the
room
which
he
was
to
share
with
jack
later
while
she
waited
for
the
biscuits
to
bake
and
for
him
to
come
home
with
the
milk
and
honey
she
wrote
a
letter
to
joyce
she
did
not
take
time
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
for
writing
material
but
emptying
the
sugar
from
a
large
paper
sack
cut
it
into
several
square
sheets
with
a
big
tin
pan
turned
bottom
upwards
in
her
lap
for
a
desk
she
hastily
scribbled
the
events
of
the
day
with
a
which
she
sharpened
with
the
joyce
has
that
letter
yet
it
was
scribbled
in
the
most
careless
commonplace
way
just
as
mary
would
have
told
it
had
they
been
together
but
joyce
who
could
read
her
little
sister
like
a
book
read
between
the
lines
and
divined
the
disappointments
she
had
conquered
and
saw
the
courage
it
took
to
make
the
most
of
every
amusing
incident
in
such
a
cheery
way
while
she
touched
only
lightly
on
the
serious
ones
we
had
a
visitor
a
little
while
ago
wrote
mary
in
closing
the
reverend
paul
rochester
came
to
call
and
where
of
all
awkward
impossible
places
do
you
suppose
he
found
me
up
on
the
windmill
tower
i
had
gone
up
again
to
watch
the
sunset
for
just
a
minute
the
glow
on
the
roofs
of
the
town
and
the
hills
beyond
was
so
lovely
if
norman
had
had
any
sense
he
would
have
ignored
my
high
perch
he
was
splitting
kindling
by
the
back
door
making
such
a
noise
that
we
could
not
hear
rochester
knock
at
the
front
door
so
he
came
around
barnaby
had
stopped
at
the
rectory
on
her
way
home
to
tell
them
about
our
coming
to
town
and
rochester
thought
that
we
were
all
here
and
that
we
would
be
so
busy
getting
settled
that
we
would
have
much
time
to
cook
things
for
an
invalid
and
she
had
sent
the
most
tempting
basketful
of
good
things
you
ever
saw
there
was
orange
gelatine
and
charlotte
russe
and
some
delicious
nut
sandwiches
the
rector
had
walked
all
the
way
up
here
and
carried
the
basket
himself
you
know
i
always
stood
in
awe
of
clergymen
at
first
this
one
seemed
fully
as
dignified
and
reverend
as
all
the
others
and
i
nearly
fell
off
my
perch
with
embarrassment
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
me
hanging
there
like
a
monkey
on
a
stick
but
the
next
moment
we
both
laughed
and
he
seemed
almost
as
young
and
boyish
as
jack
i
scuttled
down
in
a
hurry
i
assure
you
he
only
stayed
a
minute
just
long
enough
to
deliver
the
basket
and
his
wife
message
but
you
no
idea
how
that
little
incident
changed
the
whole
atmosphere
i
been
looking
down
the
white
road
that
leads
from
our
place
into
the
town
thinking
how
lonely
and
foreign
everything
was
and
how
hard
it
would
be
to
live
all
winter
in
a
place
where
nobody
wanted
to
be
neighborly
and
where
the
only
people
we
knew
were
slightly
old
like
the
barnabys
or
awfully
old
like
the
metzes
and
then
rochester
appeared
young
and
so
and
with
a
jolly
twinkle
in
his
eyes
that
makes
you
forget
the
clerical
cut
of
his
clothes
his
wife
must
be
young
too
or
she
could
be
married
to
him
and
she
must
be
dear
or
she
would
have
sent
such
a
dainty
altogether
charming
basket
with
her
message
of
greeting
you
no
idea
how
their
cordial
welcome
changed
everything
now
as
i
look
through
the
open
door
at
the
same
road
leading
to
the
town
it
does
look
lonely
and
foreign
any
more
it
makes
me
think
of
a
verse
that
dear
old
grandmother
ware
taught
me
once
you
remember
how
she
used
to
take
us
up
in
her
lap
and
make
us
spell
the
words
out
to
her
from
her
big
bible
with
the
terrible
pictures
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
ways
shall
be
made
smooth
well
grandmother
verse
is
coming
true
it
was
all
so
crooked
and
uncertain
and
rough
yesterday
but
now
everything
is
being
smoothed
out
for
us
so
beautifully
i
have
just
looked
out
to
see
if
norman
is
coming
i
can
hear
him
whistling
away
down
the
road
i
wish
you
with
your
artist
eye
for
effect
could
see
the
little
town
now
spread
out
below
the
hills
in
the
twilight
with
the
windmills
silhouetted
against
the
sky
at
one
end
is
the
little
stone
belfry
of
peter
at
the
other
the
square
gray
tower
of
the
academy
of
the
holy
angels
and
just
between
swinging
low
over
the
hills
in
the
faint
afterglow
the
pale
golden
crescent
of
the
new
moon
after
all
it
a
good
old
world
joyce
and
i
it
in
my
bones
that
little
old
bauer
is
going
to
bring
us
some
great
good
that
shall
make
us
thankful
always
for
having
come
in
some
way
i
am
sure
all
our
ways
shall
be
made
chapter
iv
mary
finds
gay
the
day
before
thanksgiving
saw
the
ware
family
fully
settled
in
their
new
home
the
trunks
had
been
unpacked
and
their
contents
disposed
of
to
make
the
little
cottage
look
as
homelike
as
possible
even
the
preparations
for
their
thanksgiving
dinner
were
all
made
they
had
been
simplified
by
barnaby
gift
of
a
jar
of
and
the
plump
hen
which
was
to
take
the
place
of
a
turkey
had
been
bought
already
dressed
now
at
only
nine
the
morning
work
was
all
done
and
ware
sat
sewing
on
the
south
gallery
where
jack
had
wheeled
himself
into
the
sunshine
mary
came
and
stood
in
the
doorway
things
stay
so
clean
here
she
grumbled
in
a
laughing
way
i
could
do
everything
there
is
to
be
done
with
one
hand
and
not
half
try
and
when
you
all
help
we
get
through
so
fast
it
makes
me
dizzy
then
nothing
left
to
do
but
sit
in
the
sun
and
wait
till
time
to
get
the
next
meal
ready
i
wish
i
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
put
everything
in
order
i
would
be
so
restless
and
idle
now
it
makes
me
fidgety
to
have
nothing
to
do
take
the
basket
and
dishes
back
to
the
rectory
suggested
ware
after
jack
had
proposed
several
occupations
to
no
purpose
but
i
never
met
rochester
yet
objected
mary
and
it
would
be
sort
of
awkward
going
in
and
introducing
myself
no
more
awkward
than
it
was
for
rochester
to
come
here
and
introduce
himself
said
jack
you
can
tell
her
for
me
that
that
charlotte
russe
was
perfection
i
wonder
what
she
is
like
mused
mary
half
persuaded
to
go
and
see
if
i
thought
she
be
approachable
and
easy
to
talk
to
but
oh
you
know
she
all
right
urged
jack
or
she
never
would
have
been
so
good
to
a
family
of
strangers
i
bet
she
a
dear
motherly
old
soul
in
a
checked
apron
with
gray
hair
and
a
double
chin
why
she
could
be
cried
mary
not
and
be
rochester
wife
he
does
look
much
older
than
you
do
and
for
all
he
so
dignified
there
something
so
boyish
and
likable
about
him
that
i
felt
chummy
with
him
right
away
well
the
things
she
cooked
tasted
as
if
she
were
the
kind
of
woman
i
said
persisted
jack
and
i
shall
keep
on
thinking
of
her
as
that
kind
until
it
proved
that
my
guess
is
wrong
i
should
think
that
anybody
with
as
much
curiosity
as
you
have
would
go
just
to
satisfy
it
you
mean
you
want
yours
satisfied
retorted
mary
well
she
do
it
herself
in
a
few
days
she
sent
word
that
she
call
soon
so
i
believe
that
i
wait
coming
out
she
stood
leaning
idly
against
one
of
the
gallery
posts
a
restless
dissatisfied
little
figure
then
she
strolled
out
to
the
front
gate
and
stood
there
awhile
looking
down
the
deserted
road
jack
gaze
followed
her
sympathetically
and
he
said
to
his
mother
in
a
low
tone
poor
little
kid
it
going
to
be
a
dull
winter
for
her
i
afraid
she
was
never
cut
out
for
solitude
she
dwell
in
the
midst
of
alarms
and
this
place
is
much
more
diverting
than
a
country
graveyard
ware
glance
followed
his
then
she
replied
confidently
as
she
looked
down
to
thread
her
needle
oh
she
soon
adjust
herself
she
find
something
that
will
not
only
keep
her
busy
but
will
amuse
all
the
rest
of
us
jack
picked
up
the
magazine
from
which
he
had
been
reading
aloud
the
evening
before
and
resumed
the
story
but
he
was
conscious
all
the
time
of
the
little
figure
at
the
gate
and
saw
her
without
seeming
to
notice
when
she
slipped
around
the
corner
of
the
house
presently
to
the
back
yard
then
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
when
he
heard
the
creaking
of
the
windmill
crank
at
the
back
of
the
house
she
stopping
the
wheel
said
ware
so
that
she
can
climb
to
the
top
of
the
tower
again
it
seems
to
have
some
sort
of
fascination
for
her
jack
went
on
with
his
story
and
mary
perched
on
her
clung
to
the
bar
above
and
looked
down
over
the
town
the
currents
of
air
were
stronger
up
at
the
height
to
which
she
had
climbed
down
below
scarcely
a
breath
was
stirring
but
here
a
fresh
breeze
blew
the
hair
into
her
eyes
and
began
to
blow
the
discontent
out
of
her
mind
her
wish
that
jack
could
see
the
view
was
followed
instantly
by
the
thought
that
he
could
never
never
have
any
other
outlook
than
the
one
the
wheeled
chair
afforded
it
wicked
of
me
to
be
discontented
one
single
minute
she
thought
remorsefully
there
i
was
fussing
right
before
him
about
having
nothing
to
do
when
he
give
worlds
just
to
be
foot
loose
to
climb
up
here
and
walk
about
the
place
and
he
was
so
dear
and
considerate
never
once
reminded
me
how
much
harder
it
is
for
him
than
me
and
that
he
has
nothing
else
to
look
forward
to
as
long
as
he
lives
the
yellow
walls
of
the
rectory
gleamed
through
the
trees
at
the
north
end
of
the
little
hamlet
reminding
her
of
jack
laughing
wish
to
know
what
rochester
was
like
it
as
little
as
i
can
do
to
go
and
find
out
for
him
she
thought
even
if
he
did
ask
it
in
a
joke
i
ought
to
be
willing
to
do
anything
in
the
world
he
expresses
a
wish
for
poor
boy
there
little
enough
here
to
amuse
him
a
few
minutes
later
in
her
travelling
suit
and
hat
with
rochester
basket
on
her
arm
she
interrupted
the
reading
on
the
gallery
i
going
to
see
your
motherly
friend
she
announced
to
find
out
if
she
is
and
maybe
i
tell
her
how
you
described
her
do
you
dare
warned
jack
laughingly
i
get
even
with
you
if
you
do
you
already
done
that
on
a
dozen
old
scores
answered
mary
gaily
my
friends
and
kinsmen
dear
as
the
story
books
say
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
what
she
saw
when
she
rang
the
bell
at
the
rectory
was
the
exact
opposite
of
the
motherly
creature
whom
jack
had
pictured
for
rochester
who
came
to
the
door
herself
was
tall
and
slim
and
very
young
with
the
delicate
spirituelle
kind
of
beauty
that
had
always
been
plump
little
mary
greatest
admiration
and
desire
one
part
of
jack
guess
was
correct
however
she
wore
a
big
checked
apron
for
she
was
making
cake
and
she
invited
mary
into
the
where
the
materials
were
all
spread
out
on
the
table
with
the
girlish
cordiality
that
had
won
her
so
many
friends
even
in
unsociable
bauer
she
made
mary
feel
so
much
at
home
that
in
a
few
moments
she
was
insisting
on
helping
with
the
cake
it
seemed
a
matter
of
course
that
rochester
should
hand
her
the
and
before
the
eggs
were
whipped
into
a
stiff
white
mountain
of
snow
they
were
exchanging
experiences
like
old
friends
rochester
had
found
bauer
a
lonely
place
too
at
first
jack
says
there
was
some
great
made
when
i
alighted
on
this
planet
said
mary
i
should
have
dropped
down
some
place
where
breaking
waves
dashed
high
on
a
stern
and
coast
he
says
i
was
meant
for
a
quiet
existence
i
know
laughed
her
hostess
you
feel
as
if
you
were
bound
into
the
wrong
book
you
be
perfectly
satisfied
to
find
yourself
in
one
of
scott
novels
in
a
jumble
of
knights
and
tourneys
and
border
wars
but
you
would
be
bored
beyond
endurance
to
have
to
be
one
of
the
characters
in
jane
austen
stories
oh
you
know
cried
mary
eagerly
emphasizing
her
pleasure
with
a
harder
bang
of
the
you
understand
exactly
there
nothing
tamer
than
miss
austen
stories
why
there
pages
and
pages
taken
up
with
just
discussing
the
weather
and
each
other
health
and
they
do
such
trivial
inane
things
and
go
around
and
around
in
such
a
deadly
monotonous
circle
that
sometimes
i
been
so
out
of
patience
with
them
that
i
wanted
to
throw
the
book
into
a
corner
but
you
never
did
throw
it
down
answered
rochester
you
read
on
to
the
end
and
in
spite
of
yourself
you
were
interested
in
those
same
commonplace
happenings
and
conversations
just
as
readers
before
you
have
been
interested
in
them
and
always
will
be
as
long
as
those
books
live
and
i
tell
you
why
you
read
them
to
the
end
because
they
are
true
pictures
of
the
lives
of
average
people
the
majority
of
us
have
to
put
up
with
the
humdrum
no
matter
how
much
we
long
for
the
heroic
and
it
a
good
thing
to
read
such
books
as
and
and
every
now
and
then
as
a
sort
of
we
more
satisfied
to
amble
along
the
road
if
everybody
else
drives
a
slow
nag
too
i
not
declared
mary
i
want
to
whizz
past
everything
in
sight
that
is
poky
and
slow
i
know
it
would
be
lots
easier
for
me
if
i
could
only
make
up
my
mind
to
the
fact
that
nothing
exciting
and
important
is
ever
going
to
happen
to
me
but
i
ca
break
myself
of
the
habit
of
expecting
it
i
felt
that
way
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
always
looking
for
something
grand
and
unexpected
and
every
morning
when
i
wake
up
it
gives
me
a
sort
of
thrill
to
think
maybe
it
will
come
well
if
you
going
to
stay
in
bauer
for
awhile
you
certainly
do
need
another
dose
of
answered
rochester
nodding
to
the
shelves
in
the
adjoining
library
where
stood
a
well
thumbed
edition
of
miss
austen
works
take
her
home
with
you
and
any
of
the
books
you
think
your
brother
would
like
we
are
glad
to
make
our
library
a
circulating
one
mary
face
showed
her
pleasure
quite
as
much
as
her
words
as
she
left
her
seat
by
the
table
to
slip
into
the
great
room
and
glance
around
it
you
made
up
for
one
of
my
disappointments
she
called
back
i
had
counted
so
much
on
having
the
library
in
san
antonio
to
draw
on
this
winter
and
this
is
even
better
for
i
sure
that
they
have
all
these
rare
old
prints
and
first
editions
that
i
see
here
her
five
minutes
call
stretched
into
an
hour
when
she
found
that
rochester
had
been
brought
up
in
washington
and
had
spent
her
school
days
there
then
it
stretched
into
two
for
some
one
drove
in
from
the
country
with
a
carriage
load
of
autumn
leaves
and
mary
stayed
to
help
arrange
them
in
the
little
church
for
the
thanksgiving
service
next
day
it
was
nearly
noon
when
she
finally
started
home
with
several
books
under
her
arm
her
usual
hopefulness
and
buoyancy
of
spirits
quite
restored
mamma
and
i
ca
both
be
away
from
jack
at
the
same
time
she
said
in
response
to
rochester
invitation
to
attend
the
service
next
day
i
want
her
to
come
i
already
had
my
share
of
thanksgiving
been
thankful
every
minute
while
i
been
here
that
i
discovered
you
it
been
a
beautiful
morning
come
over
often
urged
rochester
cordially
i
can
always
find
something
for
you
to
do
and
i
love
to
have
you
come
mary
wave
of
the
hand
as
she
turned
to
latch
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
walk
was
answered
by
a
flutter
of
rochester
apron
in
the
doorway
and
each
went
her
way
smiling
over
the
recollection
of
the
other
she
a
diverting
little
piece
rochester
reported
to
her
husband
at
noon
i
laughed
all
the
time
she
was
here
she
a
darling
mary
reported
at
home
and
quoted
her
at
intervals
for
several
days
she
promised
to
take
me
with
her
sometime
when
she
drives
out
to
call
at
the
ranches
nearly
all
the
members
of
boniface
are
people
so
they
probably
not
call
on
us
she
says
but
she
coming
as
soon
as
she
can
get
around
to
it
i
saw
our
name
on
a
list
she
has
hanging
beside
her
calendar
but
there
nearly
a
week
full
of
things
for
her
to
do
before
she
gets
to
us
i
wish
that
i
had
a
list
of
duties
and
engagements
that
would
keep
me
going
every
minute
the
way
she
has
to
go
you
can
easily
fill
out
a
list
that
will
keep
you
busy
for
awhile
answered
her
mother
while
you
were
gone
jack
and
i
got
to
discussing
dates
and
it
was
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
find
that
christmas
will
be
here
so
soon
one
forgets
the
calendar
in
this
climate
whatever
we
send
to
holland
and
joyce
must
be
started
from
here
in
less
than
three
weeks
and
as
our
gifts
must
be
all
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
any
time
in
beginning
the
problem
of
christmas
giving
had
always
been
a
knotty
one
in
the
ware
household
but
it
was
especially
hard
this
year
mary
spent
nearly
all
afternoon
making
her
list
of
names
with
the
accompanying
list
of
gifts
that
seemed
suitable
for
each
one
there
were
so
many
to
whom
she
longed
to
send
little
remembrances
that
the
length
of
it
was
appalling
then
she
revised
it
putting
in
one
column
such
people
as
madam
chartley
and
lee
to
whom
she
decided
to
write
letters
the
gayest
brightest
greetings
she
could
think
of
still
there
were
a
goodly
number
left
to
provide
with
gifts
no
matter
how
simple
and
she
was
busy
till
measuring
and
figuring
over
the
amount
of
material
she
would
need
for
each
and
how
much
it
would
cost
it
had
been
decided
that
she
should
go
to
san
antonio
for
a
day
to
attend
to
the
family
shopping
the
trouble
is
she
sighed
next
morning
it
the
simplest
things
that
are
always
the
hardest
to
get
do
you
remember
in
the
story
of
beauty
and
the
beast
the
father
had
no
difficulty
in
buying
ropes
of
jewels
and
costly
things
for
his
oldest
daughters
but
it
almost
cost
him
his
life
to
get
the
one
common
little
white
rose
that
his
youngest
daughter
so
modestly
asked
for
i
could
do
this
shopping
in
a
few
hours
if
i
did
not
have
to
stop
to
consider
pennies
but
there
are
several
little
things
that
may
take
me
all
day
to
find
i
sure
that
that
particular
kind
of
narrow
beading
that
i
need
for
lloyd
present
will
prove
to
be
the
fatal
white
rose
i
ca
make
it
without
and
there
is
time
to
send
back
east
for
it
maybe
you
better
arrange
to
stay
over
night
suggested
her
mother
and
take
two
days
to
look
around
for
what
you
want
of
course
you
could
go
to
a
hotel
alone
and
it
would
be
too
expensive
even
if
you
had
company
but
rochester
might
be
able
to
recommend
some
private
family
who
has
rooms
for
transients
mary
caught
at
the
idea
so
eagerly
that
had
it
not
been
thanksgiving
day
and
she
feared
to
intrude
she
would
have
gone
that
very
hour
to
ask
if
the
rochesters
knew
of
such
a
place
she
remembered
that
they
were
to
have
guests
to
dinner
fortunately
for
her
peace
of
mind
the
rector
and
his
wife
called
for
a
few
moments
just
before
dusk
rochester
did
know
of
a
quiet
inexpensive
place
where
she
could
spend
the
night
and
then
and
there
slipped
off
her
gloves
to
write
a
cordial
note
of
introduction
it
rained
the
friday
after
thanksgiving
but
the
next
day
was
fair
and
mary
insisted
on
doing
the
week
washing
saturday
morning
and
as
much
of
the
ironing
as
she
could
accomplish
in
the
afternoon
in
order
to
be
able
to
start
early
monday
morning
several
times
she
left
her
tubs
to
run
into
the
house
and
jot
down
some
small
items
on
her
memorandum
which
she
remembered
would
be
indispensable
in
making
up
their
christmas
packages
once
she
thought
of
something
in
the
night
when
the
barking
of
a
neighbor
dog
awakened
her
if
she
had
been
alone
in
the
room
she
would
have
lighted
a
candle
and
made
a
note
of
it
as
it
was
she
was
afraid
to
do
so
lest
she
waken
her
mother
and
afraid
not
to
lest
it
should
slip
her
mind
before
morning
finally
she
settled
the
difficulty
by
putting
her
hand
to
her
head
and
pulling
out
several
hairs
which
she
twisted
together
and
tied
around
her
finger
there
she
said
to
herself
hair
will
make
me
think
of
herring
and
then
ring
will
make
me
think
of
the
little
white
celluloid
rings
that
i
must
get
for
those
holders
armed
with
rochester
letter
she
started
off
gaily
on
the
monday
morning
train
it
was
not
due
in
the
city
till
nearly
ten
so
she
decided
that
it
would
save
time
to
go
at
once
to
the
largest
department
store
check
her
and
wait
until
shopping
hours
were
over
before
going
out
to
the
which
rochester
had
recommended
she
had
thought
san
antonio
charming
the
first
time
she
saw
it
but
it
seemed
doubly
so
now
that
she
came
back
to
it
as
one
familiar
with
its
principal
streets
and
landmarks
the
life
the
color
the
holiday
air
of
the
crowds
the
fête
day
atmosphere
of
the
old
town
itself
exhilarated
her
till
her
cheeks
glowed
like
roses
and
several
times
both
on
the
street
and
in
the
stores
she
caught
herself
whistling
half
under
her
breath
although
the
usual
monday
morning
bargain
hunters
were
out
in
throngs
she
found
no
trouble
in
making
her
purchases
everything
seemed
to
be
in
her
favor
this
morning
the
shop
girls
were
unusually
responsive
and
helpful
showed
her
just
what
she
wanted
or
suggested
something
better
than
she
had
thought
of
only
once
or
twice
did
the
prices
go
above
the
limit
she
had
set
for
them
and
several
times
they
were
lower
by
quarter
to
twelve
she
had
checked
off
two
thirds
of
the
articles
on
her
list
elated
by
this
success
she
stood
waiting
at
the
transfer
desk
for
her
change
looking
around
with
unabated
interest
suddenly
her
attention
was
attracted
to
a
girl
in
a
brown
tailor
suit
standing
in
the
next
aisle
her
back
was
turned
towards
mary
but
there
was
something
familiar
looking
in
the
poise
of
the
graceful
head
something
very
familiar
looking
in
the
puffs
of
soft
hair
held
by
amber
combs
and
arranged
so
becomingly
under
the
big
brown
hat
mary
had
been
on
the
all
morning
for
the
girl
whom
jack
had
recognized
at
the
hotel
as
gay
melville
she
might
have
missed
her
had
gay
been
an
ordinary
blonde
or
brunette
but
as
jack
said
there
was
no
mistaking
that
glorious
hair
snatching
up
the
proffered
change
which
the
cashier
put
through
the
cage
window
she
pushed
her
way
into
the
next
aisle
the
girl
turned
the
big
plumed
hat
drooped
over
her
face
still
mary
recognized
the
delicate
profile
the
slight
tilt
of
the
slender
chin
it
was
an
opportunity
which
she
could
not
afford
to
lose
and
as
the
girl
turned
her
back
again
to
receive
a
package
held
out
to
her
by
a
clerk
and
started
slowly
to
the
door
mary
hurried
after
her
almost
breathless
in
her
eagerness
she
exclaimed
impulsively
i
beg
your
pardon
but
are
you
there
was
an
instant
of
freezing
silence
as
the
eyes
of
the
girl
in
brown
swept
mary
from
head
to
foot
well
not
particularly
was
the
indignant
reply
the
roll
of
her
r
emphasized
mary
mistake
it
was
evidently
some
stranger
from
the
north
whom
she
had
accosted
one
glance
into
her
full
face
made
mary
see
how
dire
her
mistake
had
been
there
was
no
resemblance
whatever
in
that
to
gay
wishing
that
she
could
drop
out
of
sight
through
the
floor
she
hastily
apologized
and
hurried
out
into
the
street
her
cheeks
burning
as
she
smarted
under
the
recollection
of
the
stranger
supercilious
glance
she
need
have
been
so
snippy
mary
thought
is
liable
to
make
such
mistakes
not
until
she
had
crossed
the
street
and
was
stopped
short
by
her
own
reflection
in
a
mirror
in
the
show
window
opposite
did
she
realize
how
her
question
might
have
sounded
oh
she
must
have
thought
that
i
was
asking
her
if
she
was
with
a
little
g
she
gasped
no
wonder
she
looked
at
me
so
freezingly
she
was
so
perturbed
by
this
discovery
that
she
walked
on
unmindful
of
the
direction
when
a
group
of
children
crowded
past
her
on
the
narrow
pavement
she
turned
into
a
side
street
to
avoid
being
jostled
and
walked
aimlessly
for
some
distance
it
was
the
sight
of
a
green
kettle
swinging
above
a
door
which
she
was
approaching
that
brought
her
to
herself
with
a
start
rochester
had
told
her
to
stop
at
the
sign
of
the
green
kettle
for
lunch
and
had
given
her
directions
for
finding
it
here
she
had
stumbled
upon
it
unaware
just
as
the
city
bells
were
beginning
to
clang
for
noon
at
the
next
glance
her
heart
went
to
thumping
so
hard
that
she
could
plainly
hear
it
there
on
the
step
leading
up
to
the
door
of
the
green
kettle
stood
gay
melville
the
real
gay
this
time
there
was
no
shadow
of
doubt
about
it
as
she
looked
mary
wondered
how
she
ever
could
have
mistaken
the
other
girl
for
her
although
each
had
hair
wonderfully
like
the
other
this
one
carried
a
violin
case
she
had
paused
on
her
way
in
to
call
back
something
to
the
girl
in
the
carriage
who
had
brought
her
down
town
and
the
girl
in
the
carriage
was
roberta
roberta
of
the
boyish
speech
and
coquettish
eyelashes
whose
laughing
question
held
the
girl
on
the
step
long
enough
for
mary
to
reach
it
too
and
stand
there
beside
her
while
she
gathered
courage
to
speak
it
was
the
little
pin
thrust
through
gay
tie
which
finally
brought
the
words
trembling
to
mary
lips
for
it
was
the
warwick
hall
pin
which
only
its
alumni
might
wear
those
who
had
kept
the
four
years
tryst
with
all
its
requirements
it
was
a
mailed
hand
rising
from
a
heart
to
grasp
a
spear
the
motto
and
the
crest
of
edryn
all
diffidence
fled
at
that
familiar
sight
but
this
time
mary
did
not
ask
if
the
girl
were
gay
with
a
gesture
toward
the
pin
she
cried
breathlessly
oh
i
know
by
that
you
are
miss
melville
you
gay
after
one
look
into
the
eager
gray
eyes
said
quite
as
cordially
and
you
mary
ware
i
had
a
letter
from
betty
lewis
this
very
morning
telling
me
to
be
sure
to
find
you
she
gave
a
quick
glance
at
the
chatelaine
watch
she
wore
i
have
a
minute
to
stop
i
to
play
an
obligato
for
the
great
prima
donna
madame
de
martel
and
she
has
a
beast
of
a
temper
which
she
lets
loose
if
a
person
is
one
second
late
at
rehearsal
but
i
must
take
time
to
say
one
thing
if
she
wipes
me
off
the
face
of
the
earth
for
it
the
letters
have
made
me
wild
to
know
you
at
what
hotel
can
i
find
you
i
call
this
very
day
we
taken
a
cottage
in
bauer
mary
answered
hastily
i
came
down
on
a
little
shopping
expedition
and
am
on
my
way
in
here
for
luncheon
the
heavy
chords
of
a
piano
accompaniment
rolled
threateningly
through
the
music
rooms
and
gay
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
do
be
a
long
time
over
it
she
begged
as
she
turned
towards
the
stairs
i
get
through
as
quickly
as
possible
and
hurry
back
for
another
word
with
you
mary
watched
her
out
of
sight
before
starting
into
the
of
the
green
kettle
and
then
deliberately
pinched
herself
to
make
sure
that
she
was
awake
it
was
a
good
hard
nip
which
hurt
and
smiling
to
herself
because
it
proved
that
she
was
not
dreaming
she
sat
down
at
a
table
near
the
window
to
gloat
over
the
fact
that
one
of
her
best
dreams
had
come
true
at
last
she
had
met
gay
melville
the
lunch
was
a
good
one
but
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
mary
what
was
put
before
her
that
day
anything
would
have
been
nectar
and
ambrosia
served
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
music
overhead
a
chorus
of
cherubim
and
seraphim
could
not
have
left
her
more
uplifted
madame
de
martel
might
have
the
temper
of
a
beast
at
times
but
she
had
a
voice
of
rare
sweetness
and
power
and
the
knowledge
that
it
was
gay
violin
pouring
out
that
tremulous
tender
heartbreaking
obligato
enhanced
mary
enjoyment
of
every
note
the
rehearsal
was
a
short
one
all
that
the
famous
visiting
singer
wanted
was
to
make
sure
since
her
own
accompanists
had
failed
her
that
the
local
ones
were
satisfactory
it
came
to
an
end
just
as
mary
began
her
dessert
and
almost
instantly
it
seemed
gay
was
at
her
elbow
and
seating
herself
in
the
chair
beside
her
is
it
a
shame
i
have
more
than
two
minutes
to
stay
she
began
this
is
like
having
warwick
hall
and
lloydsboro
valley
rolled
into
one
to
find
somebody
who
loves
them
both
as
much
as
i
do
i
could
talk
a
week
without
stopping
about
each
place
and
ask
a
thousand
questions
but
i
due
at
a
luncheon
out
on
government
hill
by
the
time
the
next
car
can
put
me
there
immediately
after
that
is
over
we
all
going
to
the
polo
tournament
all
during
rehearsal
i
kept
trying
to
think
of
some
way
i
could
arrange
to
see
you
and
there
only
one
you
simply
got
to
come
home
with
me
to
stay
all
night
go
on
and
finish
your
shopping
and
i
come
down
for
you
after
the
tournament
and
meet
you
anywhere
you
say
the
invitation
as
cordial
as
it
was
sudden
was
gladly
accepted
and
gay
exclaimed
oh
i
so
delighted
to
think
i
found
you
at
last
no
idea
how
often
you
were
quoted
the
summer
i
was
in
the
valley
lloyd
and
betty
and
the
old
colonel
and
alex
shelby
were
always
saying
little
mary
ware
says
i
feel
as
if
i
known
you
from
babyhood
up
and
i
know
all
about
your
past
laughed
mary
she
was
about
to
mention
several
incidents
to
prove
her
claim
when
gay
stopped
her
by
a
glance
at
the
clock
and
the
question
would
you
like
to
see
the
dress
parade
at
the
post
this
evening
most
people
do
and
it
well
worth
seeing
would
she
it
mary
beaming
face
answered
the
question
before
her
usually
ready
tongue
found
a
word
and
gay
smiled
as
she
hastily
drew
on
her
gloves
and
picked
up
her
violin
case
i
like
to
keep
you
all
to
myself
she
said
but
i
do
want
you
to
meet
some
of
the
people
that
kitty
walton
liked
best
when
she
visited
me
last
year
i
pick
up
roberta
and
lieutenant
boglin
to
take
dinner
with
us
if
i
can
get
them
they
always
so
nice
to
my
warwick
hall
friends
they
were
both
wild
about
kitty
well
at
quarter
to
five
then
i
meet
you
where
finally
the
glove
counter
at
joske
was
agreed
upon
as
a
meeting
place
and
with
a
friendly
pat
on
the
shoulder
in
passing
gay
hurried
away
to
keep
her
engagement
smiling
blissfully
after
her
mary
whispered
to
herself
with
one
of
her
old
childish
wriggles
of
pleasure
and
too
chapter
v
at
fort
sam
houston
promptly
at
the
time
agreed
upon
mary
took
her
station
by
the
glove
counter
almost
sure
that
gay
would
be
late
it
was
one
of
the
warwick
hall
traditions
that
something
tragic
always
happened
to
gay
clothes
at
the
last
moment
to
delay
her
departure
but
she
had
scarcely
seated
herself
and
deposited
her
on
the
floor
beside
her
when
the
door
opened
and
gay
came
breezily
into
the
store
her
hat
was
awry
and
her
hair
disheveled
on
time
for
once
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
but
i
could
have
been
if
roberta
had
come
to
the
rescue
she
brought
me
down
in
their
carriage
it
roberta
mayrell
she
explained
as
they
made
their
way
as
rapidly
as
possible
down
the
crowded
aisle
she
is
really
one
of
the
army
girls
but
she
lives
just
outside
the
post
and
has
always
been
counted
in
everything
there
since
she
was
old
enough
to
talk
i
been
telling
her
all
about
you
on
the
way
down
well
i
hope
she
find
me
as
interesting
as
the
alligators
began
mary
remembering
the
speech
she
had
overheard
from
the
hotel
balcony
but
gay
was
stopping
to
apologize
to
an
old
lady
whom
she
had
bumped
into
and
did
not
hear
the
remark
the
next
moment
they
were
outside
and
at
the
curbstone
where
a
carriage
drawn
by
two
kentucky
horses
was
in
waiting
and
roberta
was
stepping
down
with
outstretched
hands
to
welcome
her
roberta
at
close
range
was
even
more
fascinating
than
when
seen
from
a
hotel
balcony
and
mary
sitting
between
the
two
girls
as
they
drove
along
towards
government
hill
had
much
the
same
feeling
that
a
thirsty
bedouin
has
when
after
miles
of
desert
journeying
he
finds
himself
beside
the
well
of
a
green
oasis
they
were
fairly
bubbling
over
with
high
spirits
and
it
was
impossible
to
be
with
them
and
not
share
their
exhilaration
before
they
had
gone
two
blocks
the
weight
of
care
and
anxiety
that
had
been
resting
on
mary
shoulders
ever
since
jack
accident
began
to
slip
off
it
almost
gave
her
a
sense
of
having
wings
to
be
so
light
and
care
free
the
last
eight
months
with
their
constant
association
with
suffering
and
anxiety
about
finances
had
been
like
a
hard
march
through
the
sands
now
the
sudden
substitution
of
something
frivolous
and
young
was
so
refreshing
that
she
giggled
almost
hysterically
in
her
enjoyment
of
it
oh
we
forgot
to
tell
you
exclaimed
gay
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
parade
grounds
there
to
be
a
hop
at
the
gymnasium
for
the
visiting
polo
team
they
got
it
up
on
short
notice
lieutenant
boglin
told
me
about
it
when
i
invited
him
to
come
to
dinner
he
asked
if
he
might
take
you
and
i
said
he
might
for
of
course
you
wo
want
to
miss
it
and
old
bogey
is
quite
the
nicest
officer
in
the
bunch
when
it
comes
to
giving
a
girl
a
good
time
mary
face
wore
such
a
comical
expression
of
blended
delight
and
dismay
that
roberta
laughed
and
gay
stopped
the
refusal
that
mary
was
beginning
to
stammer
out
by
putting
both
hands
over
her
ears
no
i
wo
listen
she
declared
of
course
you
did
expect
to
do
anything
like
this
and
did
bring
the
proper
clothes
but
it
is
such
an
informal
affair
that
it
does
make
any
difference
roberta
and
i
can
rig
you
out
in
something
of
mine
it
will
be
all
the
more
fun
oh
it
just
the
larkiest
lark
that
ever
was
exclaimed
mary
so
excited
over
the
prospect
that
her
cheeks
were
growing
redder
and
redder
and
her
eyes
shining
with
happy
anticipation
this
day
has
been
full
of
thrills
and
oo
oo
there
goes
another
she
added
with
a
little
shiver
of
delight
as
the
band
began
to
play
the
carriage
had
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
parade
ground
where
the
usual
crowd
of
spectators
was
gathered
martial
music
always
sends
cold
shivers
up
and
down
my
back
she
said
gravely
it
makes
me
want
to
cheer
and
march
right
off
to
do
something
big
and
brave
the
heights
or
bleed
and
die
for
my
country
or
something
of
that
sort
i
always
thought
that
i
have
been
a
soldier
if
i
had
been
born
a
girl
she
laughed
as
she
said
it
but
there
was
a
quiver
of
earnestness
in
her
voice
parade
was
a
affair
to
gay
and
roberta
a
part
of
the
weekly
routine
of
post
life
which
familiarity
made
ordinary
they
exchanged
amused
glances
which
mary
did
not
see
and
made
remarks
and
criticisms
on
the
manoeuvres
which
she
did
not
hear
wholly
absorbed
she
leaned
forward
in
the
carriage
watching
every
movement
of
the
drill
it
is
always
an
inspiring
sight
even
to
one
who
looks
no
farther
than
the
outward
show
admiring
the
precision
which
makes
a
battalion
move
as
one
man
but
to
mary
every
khaki
coat
in
the
regiment
clothed
a
hero
lexington
and
valley
forge
gettysburg
and
chickamauga
called
to
her
through
every
and
bugle
note
she
had
loved
her
old
copy
of
the
history
of
the
united
states
and
many
a
time
had
spread
it
out
on
her
desk
to
when
she
should
have
been
studying
other
things
she
had
pored
over
its
stories
of
war
till
the
black
and
white
of
its
printed
pages
had
transformed
her
into
a
little
of
a
patriot
now
as
she
saw
for
the
first
time
these
men
who
stood
as
the
guardians
of
old
glory
everything
she
had
ever
read
of
heroism
and
and
glorious
dying
came
back
to
her
in
a
flood
of
enthusiasm
which
nearly
lifted
her
to
her
feet
when
at
last
the
band
struck
into
the
banner
and
the
guns
fired
the
signal
which
heralded
the
lowering
of
the
colors
her
plain
little
face
was
almost
transfigured
with
the
exalted
emotions
of
the
moment
aye
call
it
holy
ground
the
soil
that
they
have
trod
she
was
repeating
to
herself
when
she
became
aware
that
roberta
was
trying
to
attract
her
attention
and
was
holding
out
a
box
of
candy
come
down
to
earth
she
exclaimed
laughingly
i
tried
to
get
you
to
take
some
earlier
in
the
action
but
you
had
eyes
for
anything
but
the
brass
buttons
i
do
believe
you
would
have
heard
thunder
it
was
brass
buttons
i
was
seeing
began
mary
it
was
then
realizing
the
utter
hopelessness
of
trying
to
explain
what
visions
had
been
hers
for
that
little
space
of
time
that
the
band
played
and
the
heroes
of
the
past
as
well
as
the
present
passed
before
her
she
did
as
roberta
advised
came
down
to
earth
and
took
a
caramel
when
they
reached
major
melville
house
in
the
officers
quarters
roberta
dismissed
the
carriage
and
went
in
with
gay
and
mary
she
had
decided
not
to
change
her
dress
for
the
hop
she
said
as
she
threw
off
her
long
cloak
in
the
hall
revealing
the
pretty
frock
of
pink
and
gray
foulard
which
she
had
worn
at
the
luncheon
melville
came
out
to
meet
them
a
large
woman
with
a
certain
faded
fairness
and
enough
of
a
resemblance
to
gay
to
suggest
what
she
might
have
looked
like
in
her
teens
her
cordial
welcome
put
mary
at
ease
at
once
and
she
followed
the
girls
up
the
broad
staircase
feeling
that
this
visit
was
quite
the
most
delightful
thing
which
had
happened
to
her
since
she
left
warwick
hall
while
gay
rummaged
through
trunks
and
wardrobes
to
find
party
raiment
for
her
guest
mary
walked
about
the
room
experiencing
more
thrills
at
every
turn
for
on
each
wall
and
and
bracket
was
some
picture
or
souvenir
of
warwick
hall
or
lloydsboro
valley
oh
there
lloyd
and
betty
and
the
walton
girls
she
cried
i
have
this
same
picture
at
home
and
one
like
this
of
madam
chartley
too
in
her
chair
with
the
carved
griffins
on
it
what
a
splendid
picture
this
is
of
alex
shelby
she
called
a
moment
later
then
catching
sight
of
a
larger
one
on
the
mantel
in
a
silver
frame
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
why
you
have
two
of
doctor
alex
gay
was
deep
in
a
closet
her
head
between
rows
of
and
she
made
no
answer
but
roberta
perching
in
the
cleared
her
throat
to
attract
mary
attention
and
then
with
an
impish
smile
held
up
seven
fingers
and
pointed
in
different
directions
to
five
other
photographs
that
mary
had
not
yet
discovered
one
for
each
day
in
the
week
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
give
a
good
deal
to
see
that
man
he
was
here
last
spring
but
i
was
down
on
the
coast
and
missed
him
i
intend
to
make
a
point
of
staying
at
home
next
time
he
comes
i
want
to
see
for
myself
what
up
gay
pretends
there
is
anything
but
i
have
my
own
ideas
oh
is
he
coming
again
cried
mary
roberta
only
answer
was
a
significant
nod
for
gay
emerged
from
the
closet
just
then
there
nothing
in
there
she
announced
but
i
just
thought
of
one
that
lucy
left
here
this
spring
i
ask
mother
where
it
is
you
see
said
roberta
as
the
door
closed
behind
gay
i
would
tease
her
if
she
confess
anything
but
she
wo
kitty
walton
thinks
guessed
right
too
she
said
that
from
the
moment
she
heard
about
their
romantic
meeting
she
was
sure
something
would
come
of
it
oh
tell
me
about
it
urged
mary
i
know
doctor
alex
so
well
that
i
ca
help
being
interested
and
do
you
know
a
place
in
lloydsboro
valley
called
the
log
cabin
asked
roberta
a
fine
country
home
built
of
logs
and
furnished
with
beautiful
old
heirlooms
gay
sister
harcourt
rented
it
one
summer
indeed
i
do
know
it
assented
mary
it
is
a
fascinating
place
with
a
big
outside
on
the
porch
and
the
front
is
covered
with
a
climbing
rose
we
used
to
pass
it
often
well
kitty
says
that
the
day
after
the
harcourts
took
possession
gay
put
a
ladder
against
the
front
of
the
house
and
climbed
up
on
it
to
hang
a
mirror
on
the
outside
of
her
the
way
they
do
in
holland
it
was
one
she
had
brought
all
the
way
from
amsterdam
and
while
she
was
up
on
the
ladder
looking
like
a
picture
of
course
with
the
roses
all
about
her
and
the
sunshine
turning
her
hair
to
gold
shelby
came
by
on
horseback
she
saw
him
in
the
mirror
and
the
girls
teased
her
about
it
called
it
her
lady
of
shalott
mirror
and
him
her
knight
of
the
kitty
says
he
was
devotion
itself
to
her
all
summer
what
more
she
might
have
revealed
was
interrupted
by
gay
return
she
tossed
an
armful
of
dainty
muslin
and
lace
on
the
bed
and
for
a
few
moments
all
three
gave
their
undivided
attention
to
the
process
i
must
confess
it
does
look
as
if
it
were
fitted
to
you
in
perfect
health
confessed
roberta
but
it
one
of
those
soft
clinging
things
that
does
have
to
fit
like
a
glove
i
can
pin
it
up
on
you
to
make
it
look
all
right
and
it
so
pretty
with
all
that
fine
lace
and
embroidery
that
it
pass
muster
anywhere
gay
sat
down
to
make
some
slight
alteration
in
the
girdle
while
roberta
invited
mary
to
a
seat
in
front
of
the
proposing
to
try
her
skill
on
her
as
a
it
was
all
so
delightfully
intimate
and
friendly
just
such
a
situation
as
mary
had
longed
for
in
her
building
that
she
even
felt
at
liberty
to
grow
a
little
personal
with
roberta
she
peeped
out
through
the
hair
which
now
hung
over
her
face
to
watch
roberta
face
reflected
in
the
mirror
opposite
do
you
know
she
remarked
with
a
mischievous
glance
like
a
skye
terrier
peeping
through
its
bangs
that
i
actually
lain
awake
nights
wondering
if
you
been
persuaded
yet
to
give
up
that
little
curl
roberta
mouth
opened
wide
in
astonishment
and
she
dropped
the
comb
with
which
she
was
parting
mary
hair
how
spooky
she
cried
i
was
just
thinking
about
that
myself
who
in
the
world
told
you
anything
about
that
oh
i
overheard
the
remark
confessed
mary
i
was
on
one
of
those
hotel
balconies
all
hidden
by
when
you
and
gay
and
wade
and
the
officer
you
call
bogey
came
out
into
the
court
i
was
so
lonesome
for
some
young
person
to
talk
to
and
so
close
to
you
all
that
i
could
see
the
comb
slipping
out
of
gay
hair
i
did
know
who
she
was
then
if
i
had
i
should
have
leaned
over
the
railing
and
called
to
her
would
it
have
made
a
sensation
i
never
forget
how
either
of
you
looked
she
was
in
white
with
white
violets
and
you
were
in
pale
lemon
yellow
with
a
scarf
over
your
shoulders
that
looked
like
a
white
moonbeam
spangled
with
dewdrops
it
slipped
down
as
you
started
to
go
and
see
the
alligators
and
that
wade
drew
it
up
for
you
and
said
what
he
did
about
the
curl
that
was
the
first
time
he
ever
mentioned
it
explained
roberta
i
thought
when
you
spoke
that
you
meant
last
night
i
was
going
to
tell
gay
about
it
and
as
long
as
you
so
interested
i
do
mind
telling
you
too
you
know
wade
has
been
very
nice
to
me
and
i
thought
he
was
great
fun
until
he
began
to
get
sentimental
my
brother
william
knew
him
at
college
and
he
told
me
what
i
might
expect
he
said
chap
always
gets
sentimental
with
every
girl
he
goes
with
it
a
great
thing
to
have
plenty
of
brothers
to
put
you
wise
when
wade
began
that
nonsense
about
wanting
one
of
those
little
curls
and
its
being
the
most
fetching
thing
he
had
ever
seen
i
laughed
at
him
but
it
only
made
him
the
more
determined
he
wrote
some
poetry
about
wearing
it
over
his
heart
forever
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
if
he
only
could
have
known
how
billy
and
i
shrieked
over
it
of
course
i
had
given
him
the
slightest
encouragement
or
it
would
have
been
different
roberta
interrupted
gay
sternly
how
can
you
say
that
you
know
you
looked
at
him
i
saw
you
do
it
and
when
you
look
out
at
anybody
from
under
those
lashes
whether
you
mean
it
or
not
you
look
flirtatious
and
you
know
it
i
do
contradicted
roberta
hotly
with
boyish
directness
i
help
the
way
my
lashes
are
kinked
and
i
very
sure
i
not
going
to
pull
them
out
to
keep
people
from
getting
a
wrong
impression
anyhow
there
no
kink
in
my
tongue
i
told
him
straight
enough
what
i
thought
of
his
silly
speeches
i
put
a
stop
to
them
last
night
all
right
how
demanded
gay
well
began
roberta
plaiting
mary
hair
so
energetically
that
it
pulled
dreadfully
he
went
over
the
same
performance
again
begging
me
for
that
little
curl
in
token
that
i
be
forevermore
etc
and
after
he
spun
it
out
into
a
most
romantic
proposal
i
said
very
sweetly
wade
to
be
honest
with
you
i
ca
afford
to
give
away
a
cent
curl
to
every
man
who
asks
for
one
you
see
i
always
financially
embarrassed
for
papa
wo
let
me
borrow
after
i
spent
my
monthly
allowance
and
i
never
by
any
chance
have
a
cent
left
over
after
the
second
of
the
month
but
if
you
must
have
a
curl
i
give
you
madame
main
address
on
houston
street
where
you
can
get
an
exact
duplicate
i
sure
it
will
be
just
as
good
to
wear
over
your
heart
as
mine
would
roberta
you
little
beast
laughed
gay
how
could
you
give
him
the
impression
they
were
false
when
you
know
very
well
they
grow
tight
on
your
own
scalp
i
wanted
to
see
if
he
would
say
all
thy
faults
i
love
thee
still
but
he
did
he
got
very
stiff
and
red
and
walked
away
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
flirting
with
louie
rowan
to
show
that
he
did
care
gay
continuing
to
shake
her
head
in
a
shocked
and
disapproving
way
roberta
cried
out
i
do
care
it
no
worse
than
what
you
said
to
a
certain
freshman
who
proposed
to
you
i
do
call
that
a
proposal
calmly
disagreed
gay
he
did
ask
anything
he
simply
took
it
for
granted
that
i
fall
all
over
myself
to
accept
him
mary
what
would
you
say
to
a
boy
one
whom
you
always
known
but
who
never
been
particularly
nice
to
you
who
would
march
up
to
you
some
day
and
say
suit
me
better
than
any
girl
i
know
and
i
like
to
talk
over
arrangements
with
you
now
of
course
we
marry
till
a
year
after
my
graduation
but
i
want
to
have
it
settled
before
i
go
away
so
that
i
know
what
to
depend
on
my
family
all
tell
me
that
it
risky
business
choosing
a
wife
with
red
hair
but
willing
to
take
the
chances
now
gay
you
know
it
was
as
bald
as
that
protested
roberta
he
put
in
all
sorts
of
and
short
sweetenin
it
amounted
to
the
same
thing
persisted
gay
and
in
answer
to
gasping
question
what
you
say
she
replied
i
could
speak
at
first
i
was
so
furious
at
his
speech
about
red
hair
but
i
managed
to
tell
him
several
things
before
i
finished
and
nothing
can
be
frostier
and
snippier
than
a
sixteen
year
old
girl
when
she
tries
to
appear
very
dignified
that
was
my
age
then
the
thing
that
made
him
maddest
however
was
that
i
told
him
that
even
the
who
would
go
knew
how
to
go
about
such
a
matter
in
a
much
better
way
than
he
did
that
he
better
wait
till
he
was
older
and
amounted
to
something
more
than
a
mere
silly
boy
my
snubbing
almost
gave
him
apoplexy
but
it
did
him
good
in
the
long
run
a
proposal
and
she
was
a
year
younger
than
i
am
now
thought
mary
wishing
with
a
queer
little
throb
of
envy
that
she
had
some
such
experience
to
confess
roberta
was
only
nineteen
now
and
to
judge
by
gay
teasing
remarks
had
had
any
number
of
romantic
affairs
lloyd
was
only
fourteen
when
phil
first
began
to
care
so
much
for
her
roberta
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
her
hair
now
and
as
eyes
met
their
wistful
reflection
in
the
mirror
she
wondered
if
there
would
ever
be
a
time
when
any
one
would
care
enough
for
her
to
come
to
her
with
the
momentous
question
she
would
mind
so
much
being
an
old
maid
if
she
could
only
have
some
such
experience
to
lay
away
in
her
memory
as
people
lay
away
treasures
in
and
lavender
but
so
far
she
could
count
even
a
susceptible
youth
like
young
wade
or
a
conceited
freshman
like
gay
early
admirer
she
wanted
to
ask
how
it
felt
to
be
proposed
to
and
thus
keep
the
conversation
rolling
along
in
the
same
interesting
groove
but
roberta
suddenly
switched
off
to
saddles
she
was
about
to
buy
a
new
one
and
saddles
as
roberta
presented
the
topic
became
so
vastly
important
that
mary
did
not
have
the
courage
to
attempt
to
turn
the
talk
back
to
the
subject
of
mere
men
it
was
one
of
roberta
chief
characteristics
that
she
swept
everything
before
her
by
the
sheer
force
of
her
personality
she
dominated
whatever
company
she
was
in
and
the
most
frivolous
things
she
said
carried
weight
and
made
people
listen
because
of
the
way
she
said
them
she
made
statements
in
the
same
manner
she
was
now
thrusting
the
into
mary
in
a
direct
forcible
way
that
made
people
feel
that
they
might
be
depended
upon
roberta
pins
always
stay
where
they
are
put
gay
remarked
admiringly
as
she
watched
the
capable
way
in
which
mary
was
being
fastened
into
her
borrowed
gown
there
no
danger
of
your
coming
to
pieces
when
she
fixes
you
sometimes
i
think
that
she
must
hypnotize
things
it
a
gift
with
her
there
you
look
perfectly
fine
come
on
down
stairs
and
let
try
that
piece
of
new
music
before
dinner
mary
had
her
doubts
about
looking
perfectly
fine
she
was
uncomfortably
conscious
that
the
dress
was
not
a
good
fit
it
was
too
tight
in
the
and
too
short
in
the
waist
but
the
girls
seemed
proud
of
the
costume
they
had
evolved
for
her
the
parting
glance
in
the
mirror
showed
that
the
general
effect
was
becoming
and
their
compliments
were
most
reassuring
so
she
followed
them
down
stairs
in
a
very
elated
and
partified
state
of
mind
the
old
major
affable
greeting
as
she
entered
the
was
as
cordial
as
his
wife
had
been
and
seemed
to
place
her
at
once
on
the
footing
of
an
old
friend
she
sank
into
the
comfortable
chair
he
pushed
forward
for
her
with
the
sensation
that
she
was
coming
back
to
a
familiar
hearthstone
where
she
had
been
a
guest
many
times
it
was
very
queer
but
it
was
decidedly
pleasant
to
have
it
all
seem
so
homelike
and
familiar
with
such
surroundings
mary
ought
to
have
appeared
at
her
best
but
roberta
dominating
presence
made
her
silent
and
shy
it
had
not
had
that
effect
when
they
were
together
but
now
in
the
presence
of
older
people
roberta
gave
the
effect
of
a
lamp
that
has
suddenly
been
turned
up
to
a
brighter
flame
she
was
positively
brilliant
mary
thought
and
made
everybody
else
in
the
room
seem
of
secondary
interest
roberta
who
ran
in
and
out
every
day
felt
the
same
freedom
that
a
daughter
of
the
house
would
have
she
laughingly
pushed
melville
into
a
chair
and
ordered
her
to
sit
still
while
ran
for
the
forgotten
spectacles
she
joked
with
the
major
about
numberless
things
which
were
meaningless
to
mary
because
she
had
not
shared
their
beginnings
and
when
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
played
with
strong
masterful
touches
it
really
seemed
that
what
gay
had
jokingly
said
about
her
having
hypnotic
powers
was
true
mary
felt
as
if
she
had
been
thrust
into
a
corner
and
deprived
of
power
to
come
out
at
first
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
enjoyment
of
the
music
that
she
was
not
conscious
of
that
sensation
but
it
oppressed
her
when
lieutenant
boglin
and
the
captain
of
the
polo
team
a
mills
came
in
they
were
strangers
to
her
but
old
friends
of
all
the
others
and
she
suddenly
felt
herself
as
and
shy
as
the
bashful
little
country
mouse
of
the
fable
she
began
to
contrast
herself
with
the
other
girls
and
try
to
find
a
reason
for
the
difference
which
she
felt
existed
it
partly
because
they
always
lived
in
the
heart
of
things
she
thought
a
trifle
enviously
they
used
to
meeting
strangers
and
they
pretty
and
gifted
and
accomplished
a
very
different
thing
from
being
just
little
mary
ware
with
no
talents
or
i
ca
even
play
yankee
doodle
with
one
finger
as
norman
does
when
they
went
out
to
dinner
the
uneven
number
and
the
small
size
of
the
company
made
the
conversation
general
around
the
table
if
it
had
been
a
larger
party
with
only
her
immediate
neighbors
to
give
ear
mary
was
sure
that
she
could
have
found
plenty
to
say
to
the
major
on
one
side
or
to
lieutenant
boglin
on
the
other
but
roberta
kept
the
conversational
ball
rolling
and
always
in
directions
that
mary
could
not
follow
she
knew
nothing
of
polo
or
golf
or
the
people
of
the
post
and
the
funny
stories
and
replies
which
circled
around
the
table
gave
her
no
opportunity
to
rise
to
the
occasion
as
the
others
did
illustration
mary
ware
in
texas
he
seated
himself
beside
her
in
hand
they
were
all
so
vastly
entertained
and
entertaining
themselves
that
no
one
seemed
to
notice
mary
silence
she
was
angry
with
herself
because
she
could
not
chime
in
with
the
others
and
thought
with
flaming
cheeks
that
they
must
think
her
dreadfully
stupid
and
unresponsive
just
a
miss
not
yet
out
of
the
nursery
once
there
came
a
place
where
an
anecdote
about
hawkins
and
a
new
would
have
fitted
in
beautifully
if
she
could
only
have
mustered
up
courage
to
tell
it
she
had
a
conundrum
too
when
the
others
were
propounding
them
and
had
opened
her
mouth
to
tell
it
in
fact
had
said
did
you
ever
hear
when
somebody
else
who
had
not
heard
her
tremulous
beginning
captured
the
attention
of
the
table
with
one
of
his
own
the
sound
of
her
voice
thus
suddenly
stopped
made
her
blush
choke
take
a
drink
of
water
and
subside
into
silence
again
it
was
not
until
coffee
was
being
served
afterward
in
the
that
mary
found
her
tongue
roberta
did
not
take
coffee
and
at
the
major
request
had
gone
to
the
piano
to
play
a
dashing
fantasie
that
he
always
called
for
on
such
occasions
the
lieutenant
who
as
mary
had
feared
had
classed
her
as
a
callow
little
who
could
talk
except
in
embarrassed
monosyllables
had
been
wondering
why
gay
had
made
such
a
point
of
his
meeting
her
now
as
he
looked
across
the
room
at
her
animated
face
responsive
to
every
chord
of
the
brilliantly
executed
music
he
decided
that
there
might
be
some
reason
for
gay
interest
in
her
which
he
had
not
yet
fathomed
and
he
at
once
proceeded
to
find
out
he
started
towards
her
stopping
to
say
in
an
aside
to
gay
what
the
little
girl
name
i
forgotten
oh
thank
you
then
he
deliberately
pulled
up
a
chair
wise
and
seated
himself
beside
her
in
hand
miss
ware
he
began
in
a
flatteringly
confidential
tone
it
is
an
old
saying
that
the
murmur
but
the
deeps
are
dumb
is
that
why
you
are
so
silent
this
evening
it
was
easy
now
under
cover
of
the
music
and
in
response
to
such
deferential
attention
to
make
a
reply
and
mary
began
at
a
rate
that
made
bogey
sit
up
and
take
notice
as
he
expressed
it
afterward
no
i
was
only
like
the
fox
in
æsop
fables
the
one
that
went
to
dine
with
the
stork
you
know
do
you
remember
the
stork
put
the
soup
into
such
a
deep
vase
that
only
a
bird
like
himself
could
reach
it
you
see
the
people
you
talked
about
were
utter
strangers
to
me
and
i
never
saw
a
polo
game
so
i
very
well
dip
into
the
conversation
by
george
exclaimed
bogey
that
was
very
considerate
of
us
it
oh
i
enjoyed
it
mary
hastened
to
add
only
i
was
afraid
you
think
i
was
dreadfully
stupid
it
made
me
think
of
the
time
i
used
that
same
fable
to
get
rid
of
an
unwelcome
caller
when
i
was
at
a
in
kentucky
i
wanted
to
be
with
the
older
girls
who
were
to
be
bridesmaids
and
watch
their
preparations
for
the
wedding
and
this
child
tagged
after
me
so
persistently
that
i
lay
awake
nights
trying
to
plan
some
way
to
get
rid
of
her
it
was
the
fable
that
finally
suggested
it
i
had
lots
of
fun
playing
the
stork
but
i
never
realized
before
just
how
must
have
felt
till
i
took
the
part
of
fox
tell
me
how
you
did
it
insisted
the
lieutenant
he
liked
the
way
mary
face
lighted
up
when
she
talked
and
the
way
her
dimples
flashed
in
and
out
as
she
chattered
on
gay
looked
over
approvingly
a
little
later
when
his
hearty
laugh
showed
that
he
was
thoroughly
amused
by
something
that
she
had
said
the
was
ended
by
the
stopping
of
the
music
and
the
arrival
of
the
man
who
was
to
be
gay
escort
and
almost
immediately
after
it
seemed
although
in
fact
it
was
half
an
hour
the
whistle
sounded
outside
and
mary
was
being
hurried
into
her
borrowed
party
cloak
and
helped
into
the
waiting
it
always
goes
around
the
post
collecting
passengers
on
such
occasions
as
this
bogey
told
her
you
can
imagine
we
sometimes
have
a
jolly
crowd
it
was
an
old
story
to
the
other
passengers
but
as
they
passed
the
sally
port
where
the
sentinel
stood
attention
mary
nearly
fell
out
in
her
eagerness
to
see
all
the
novel
sights
the
lieutenant
smiled
at
her
enthusiasm
visiting
girls
always
exhibited
it
in
some
degree
but
never
in
quite
such
a
precipitate
manner
as
mary
she
a
funny
little
piece
he
thought
as
the
whole
load
laughed
at
her
naïve
comment
on
the
sentinel
but
there
is
something
genuine
and
likeable
about
her
she
shall
have
the
time
of
her
life
if
i
can
give
it
to
her
chapter
vi
on
the
there
is
only
a
partial
account
of
that
evening
in
mary
good
times
book
she
recorded
the
fact
that
the
general
himself
came
and
talked
to
her
a
few
minutes
and
laughed
several
times
at
her
replies
till
people
turned
to
see
who
it
was
that
he
found
so
amusing
the
handsome
officer
of
the
day
in
sword
and
spurs
was
brought
up
to
be
introduced
and
there
was
a
most
gratifying
list
of
names
on
her
program
lieutenant
boglin
had
dutifully
seen
to
that
had
it
not
been
for
one
circumstance
the
evening
would
have
been
a
succession
of
thrills
and
she
could
have
filled
several
pages
with
enthusiastic
recollections
of
it
that
one
little
happening
however
marred
the
whole
occasion
she
made
no
record
of
it
in
her
good
times
book
and
she
made
up
her
mind
never
to
speak
of
it
but
to
seal
it
up
in
its
particular
memory
cell
as
the
bees
do
any
intruding
object
which
threatens
to
poison
their
honey
there
was
so
much
else
to
tell
about
her
visit
that
for
several
days
after
her
return
she
kept
the
family
amused
by
her
lively
descriptions
she
and
gay
had
had
a
whole
string
of
adventures
the
morning
after
the
hop
when
they
went
down
town
together
to
finish
her
shopping
there
had
been
some
interesting
guests
from
new
zealand
at
luncheon
who
had
vied
with
each
other
in
telling
marvelous
yarns
and
mary
had
stored
them
all
away
to
repeat
at
home
with
so
much
else
to
talk
about
she
might
have
succeeded
in
keeping
her
resolution
had
not
she
and
jack
gone
off
to
the
creek
one
afternoon
instead
of
taking
their
usual
excursion
towards
the
village
the
spot
where
they
paused
was
a
place
which
seemed
to
invite
confidences
she
wheeled
his
chair
along
the
bank
close
to
the
water
edge
until
they
came
to
a
secluded
circle
of
shade
under
an
ancient
cypress
tree
there
she
sat
down
opposite
him
on
a
big
boulder
they
were
some
distance
from
the
main
road
except
when
a
wagon
rattled
down
the
hill
and
across
the
ford
it
was
so
very
still
that
the
rush
of
water
over
the
pebbles
sounded
almost
brawling
the
constant
gurgle
and
swish
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
hypnotic
effect
on
them
both
for
neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
long
time
then
jack
broke
the
silence
this
monotony
is
getting
on
my
nerves
he
said
in
a
low
tense
voice
you
a
wonder
to
me
mary
i
do
see
how
you
can
come
back
to
such
a
deadly
stupid
place
as
this
is
after
the
taste
of
gay
times
had
and
settle
down
again
as
cheerfully
as
you
do
it
makes
me
desperate
whenever
i
think
that
if
it
was
for
my
being
in
such
a
fix
you
need
be
tied
here
you
could
be
where
you
have
the
social
opportunities
you
ought
to
have
mary
looked
up
quickly
this
tone
of
bitterness
was
a
new
note
in
speech
he
had
drawn
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
was
gripping
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
both
hands
as
if
trying
to
keep
his
resentment
against
fate
in
check
just
let
me
tell
you
something
cried
mary
so
anxious
to
smooth
the
grim
lines
of
suffering
out
of
the
beloved
face
that
she
recklessly
broke
her
resolution
did
have
as
good
a
time
at
that
hop
as
i
made
out
the
last
part
of
it
was
perfectly
ghastly
and
i
never
want
to
go
to
another
as
long
as
i
live
then
seeing
the
look
of
blank
amazement
that
spread
over
jack
face
she
hastened
to
explain
oh
it
started
out
beautifully
i
was
simply
ecstatic
when
we
climbed
out
of
the
and
were
ushered
into
that
long
room
with
the
flags
and
the
evergreens
and
the
military
music
and
you
already
know
how
much
it
meant
to
me
to
have
the
general
so
nice
to
me
and
the
officer
of
the
day
so
attentive
and
complimentary
and
how
happy
i
was
to
have
my
programme
filled
up
so
that
there
was
no
danger
of
my
being
a
i
was
having
the
loveliest
time
imaginable
when
i
went
up
to
gay
to
ask
if
any
of
the
showed
below
my
girdle
the
polo
man
i
had
met
at
dinner
that
mills
had
been
dancing
with
me
and
when
he
left
me
with
gay
went
over
to
speak
to
a
pretty
butterfly
sort
of
girl
a
little
brunette
all
in
frilly
pink
and
white
i
been
admiring
her
at
a
distance
of
course
he
did
know
his
voice
carried
so
far
he
was
protesting
because
she
had
left
no
place
for
him
on
her
programme
and
i
heard
him
say
was
fault
that
i
did
get
to
you
in
time
bogey
roped
me
in
first
thing
for
a
turn
with
that
kindergarten
kid
he
got
in
tow
she
miss
melville
guest
and
i
could
get
out
of
it
but
really
juliet
was
punishment
without
your
i
did
hear
the
rest
of
it
some
people
beside
me
laughed
just
then
and
drowned
his
voice
but
the
girl
looked
over
at
me
and
gave
me
a
long
searching
glance
sort
of
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
and
then
turned
away
with
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
smiled
up
at
him
quite
as
if
she
agreed
with
him
and
had
forgiven
him
because
he
had
such
a
good
excuse
i
never
had
anything
make
me
so
uncomfortable
in
all
my
life
as
his
speech
and
then
her
sidelong
look
and
nasty
little
shrug
it
was
the
he
said
it
and
the
she
answered
that
hurt
after
that
i
never
forgot
for
a
moment
that
my
dress
was
a
borrowed
one
and
that
it
did
fit
and
that
i
was
the
plain
little
country
mouse
that
they
were
polite
to
merely
because
i
was
gay
guest
and
lieutenant
boglin
asked
them
to
be
and
i
could
help
feeling
that
every
man
who
danced
with
me
was
as
bored
as
mills
had
been
even
more
so
for
i
had
been
perfectly
natural
and
at
ease
when
i
was
talking
to
him
and
after
i
overheard
his
remark
i
was
so
stiff
and
that
such
a
state
of
mind
was
bound
to
have
its
effect
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
was
perfectly
aware
that
i
was
boring
my
partners
but
that
was
such
a
little
thing
to
let
spoil
your
whole
evening
interrupted
jack
it
was
awfully
rude
of
the
fellow
to
make
such
a
speech
but
he
probably
said
it
just
to
square
himself
with
the
other
girl
fair
in
love
and
war
they
say
and
you
do
know
how
much
it
might
have
meant
to
him
to
keep
in
her
good
graces
i
believe
he
really
meant
it
oh
i
know
better
insisted
mary
dismally
he
mean
it
i
felt
it
she
slowly
gathered
up
a
handful
of
pebbles
and
sent
them
skipping
across
the
water
at
intervals
as
she
continued
it
gave
me
the
same
sensation
that
i
had
years
ago
when
i
had
my
first
toy
balloon
that
is
one
of
my
earliest
and
most
vivid
recollections
one
moment
i
was
hugging
it
to
me
because
it
was
such
a
dear
gay
red
bubble
fairly
entranced
with
the
beauty
of
it
the
next
i
was
looking
down
in
a
scared
puzzled
way
at
what
was
left
just
a
dull
scrap
of
wrinkled
rubber
that
one
remark
and
glance
and
shrug
made
all
the
pleasure
ooze
out
of
the
evening
as
quickly
as
my
hugging
squeezed
the
air
out
of
that
collapsed
balloon
jack
smiled
at
her
comparison
he
remembered
that
time
and
how
they
had
all
laughed
at
her
bewildered
expression
when
the
balloon
burst
in
her
hands
she
could
not
be
convinced
at
first
that
her
beautiful
red
bubble
had
ceased
to
be
and
hopefully
peered
under
tables
and
chairs
even
while
she
held
the
wreck
of
it
in
her
hands
jack
had
always
been
her
comforter
he
had
dried
her
tears
then
with
the
promise
of
another
balloon
as
soon
as
he
could
find
the
man
who
sold
them
and
now
he
hurried
to
lift
the
gloom
that
had
settled
down
on
her
usually
cheerful
features
having
thrown
away
all
her
pebbles
she
bunched
herself
up
into
a
disconsolate
little
heap
on
the
boulder
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
in
her
hand
no
it
no
use
your
trying
to
comfort
me
she
said
presently
in
response
to
his
repeated
attempts
every
time
i
think
about
that
evening
i
so
mortified
that
i
could
cry
my
mind
made
up
i
am
a
dead
failure
socially
and
i
never
want
to
go
to
another
function
as
long
as
i
live
you
a
little
goose
that
what
you
are
said
jack
and
i
know
what
at
the
root
of
the
whole
trouble
you
done
a
lot
of
imagining
about
your
social
career
at
one
time
and
another
you
looked
forward
to
it
and
seen
yourself
in
the
rôle
of
an
irresistible
charmer
felt
like
a
dowager
duchess
inwardly
and
forgotten
that
you
no
marks
outwardly
to
show
that
you
grown
up
to
take
such
a
part
you
have
your
own
individual
charm
but
so
far
it
is
only
the
charm
of
an
unsophisticated
little
and
naturally
grown
men
find
older
girls
more
interesting
just
as
you
would
prefer
phil
tremont
company
for
instance
to
that
of
little
billy
downs
but
that
not
saying
that
you
dislike
billy
downs
or
that
he
wo
grow
up
to
be
a
social
lion
some
day
so
may
you
now
own
up
you
always
have
pictured
yourself
as
cutting
quite
a
wide
swath
on
your
first
appearance
in
society
you
that
one
reason
you
were
so
disappointed
at
the
hop
well
admitted
mary
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
i
own
i
did
expect
to
once
a
long
time
ago
and
maybe
that
had
a
sort
of
influence
on
me
it
was
when
we
first
moved
to
arizona
hazel
lee
and
i
found
a
book
that
a
boarder
had
left
behind
in
his
tent
it
was
called
lady
agatha
career
a
novel
we
took
it
out
on
the
desert
a
little
way
and
spelled
it
out
between
us
sitting
on
the
sand
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
that
hid
us
from
view
of
the
ranch
house
hazel
was
allowed
only
juvenile
books
and
she
knew
her
mother
would
take
this
away
from
us
on
account
of
the
word
novel
it
was
such
a
horribly
sentimental
story
that
we
found
it
embarrassing
to
read
the
tenderest
parts
of
it
aloud
and
i
suppose
because
it
was
the
first
one
of
the
kind
we
had
ever
come
across
it
made
a
deeper
impression
on
us
than
it
would
have
done
otherwise
we
fairly
devoured
it
for
days
we
thought
and
talked
of
nothing
else
and
we
used
to
take
turns
playing
we
were
the
lady
agatha
about
to
burst
on
society
like
a
dazzling
star
and
win
the
heart
of
the
proud
scion
of
the
house
of
de
hoverly
jack
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
so
heartily
that
mary
was
forced
to
smile
again
herself
as
she
went
on
with
her
confession
that
all
came
back
to
me
the
other
night
when
we
climbed
out
of
the
and
i
almost
giggled
when
i
remembered
that
this
was
what
hazel
and
i
had
looked
forward
to
as
such
a
grand
event
being
escorted
for
the
first
time
by
a
grown
man
it
was
on
a
similar
occasion
that
the
lady
agatha
made
such
a
hit
in
society
our
ideas
of
society
were
so
crude
and
funny
then
mary
went
on
beginning
to
relish
her
own
reminiscences
all
we
knew
about
it
we
gathered
from
that
book
it
seemed
to
be
made
up
principally
of
haughty
earls
and
dowager
duchesses
who
lived
in
castles
and
wore
coronets
i
did
know
what
a
dowager
was
then
but
i
privately
resolved
to
be
one
when
i
was
grown
the
name
seemed
so
grand
and
and
in
the
story
they
always
had
everything
their
own
way
i
could
help
laughing
a
bit
ago
when
you
used
the
word
for
you
had
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
then
you
wo
mind
when
i
say
told
you
so
laughed
jack
if
you
had
gone
that
night
expecting
to
create
a
sensation
you
have
been
satisfied
to
have
people
nice
to
you
simply
because
you
were
their
friend
friend
and
would
have
been
so
cut
up
over
that
remark
you
overheard
i
not
so
sure
about
the
last
part
mary
insisted
her
face
clouding
again
it
nasty
of
him
to
say
it
and
the
mere
thought
of
that
man
will
always
be
an
abomination
to
me
there
was
silence
for
a
little
while
everything
was
so
still
that
a
bird
hopped
fearlessly
out
on
a
limb
above
them
and
began
to
call
to
its
mate
when
mary
spoke
again
there
was
a
whimsical
expression
on
her
face
that
soon
reflected
itself
in
jack
i
ca
help
picturing
things
out
beforehand
the
way
i
like
to
have
them
be
i
done
it
all
my
life
the
rehearsing
is
always
more
fun
though
than
the
actual
happening
now
when
i
went
away
to
school
last
year
every
time
i
wake
up
that
last
night
in
the
plan
just
what
i
say
and
how
i
act
to
make
my
entrance
to
warwick
hall
imposing
i
could
actually
see
myself
sweeping
in
to
make
a
good
impression
on
madam
chartley
and
you
know
what
happened
my
hat
was
cocked
over
one
ear
the
wire
sticking
out
through
the
loops
of
ribbon
and
madam
caught
me
jumping
up
and
down
to
try
every
seat
in
the
one
after
the
other
jack
chuckled
glad
to
see
some
of
mary
cheerfulness
returning
and
then
she
continued
you
remember
when
we
met
phil
and
elsie
tremont
on
the
train
as
we
were
going
out
to
arizona
to
live
jack
nodded
i
was
only
nine
years
old
then
but
for
weeks
i
thought
of
phil
as
a
sort
of
young
god
a
regular
apollo
and
i
pictured
all
sorts
of
scenes
in
which
i
should
be
a
prominent
personage
at
our
next
meeting
and
when
he
come
i
was
sprinting
down
the
road
in
a
cloud
of
dust
hatless
and
breathless
and
purple
in
the
face
crying
and
crazy
with
fright
because
i
thought
that
a
harmless
old
indian
who
chanced
to
be
riding
down
the
same
road
was
chasing
me
how
phil
does
laugh
every
time
that
is
mentioned
mary
was
sitting
up
straight
on
the
boulder
now
her
face
dimpling
as
she
recalled
these
various
predicaments
then
there
the
time
the
little
colonel
visited
us
at
the
wigwam
had
i
dreamed
of
that
first
meeting
for
weeks
what
we
say
and
what
she
say
me
in
my
rosebud
sash
and
best
embroidered
white
gown
but
she
caught
you
and
joyce
at
the
and
i
had
to
take
my
first
peep
at
her
crouched
down
in
an
irrigating
ditch
on
my
way
home
from
school
all
inky
and
dirty
and
torn
but
i
do
think
i
done
quite
so
much
romancing
since
betty
gave
me
my
good
times
book
and
preached
me
that
little
sermon
on
being
mary
chattered
on
she
said
that
my
always
thinking
of
the
impression
i
was
making
on
people
and
being
so
eager
to
please
was
what
made
me
miserable
when
i
fell
short
of
my
expectations
she
said
that
i
ought
to
copy
lloyd
that
her
greatest
charm
was
her
utter
unconsciousness
of
self
i
think
that
is
betty
too
she
a
darling
there
was
no
response
to
this
the
mention
of
betty
name
brought
up
so
many
pleasing
scenes
to
mary
that
she
sat
living
them
over
unmindful
of
the
long
silence
that
fell
between
her
and
jack
he
sat
with
his
hat
pulled
still
farther
over
his
eyes
in
a
revery
as
deep
as
hers
betty
name
recalled
the
picture
that
was
often
before
him
in
these
long
idle
days
he
was
seeing
her
as
he
had
seen
her
the
first
time
now
over
a
year
ago
when
he
made
his
memorable
visit
to
kentucky
she
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
long
locust
avenue
all
in
white
between
the
stately
white
pillars
with
her
godmother
arm
about
her
as
they
awaited
his
approach
slim
and
girlish
and
winsomely
sweet
she
was
and
when
he
looked
into
her
wistful
brown
eyes
he
felt
in
some
strange
way
that
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
all
pilgrimage
the
world
held
nothing
beyond
worth
seeking
for
after
a
long
time
the
swirl
of
the
water
past
them
was
lost
in
the
sound
of
a
wagon
rattling
noisily
down
the
hill
and
across
the
ford
then
a
long
line
of
cattle
passed
down
the
same
road
accompanied
by
the
hoarse
calls
of
their
drivers
on
horseback
mary
looked
up
jack
she
said
hesitatingly
did
you
ever
hear
this
verse
should
he
come
not
by
the
road
and
come
not
by
the
hill
and
come
not
by
the
far
yet
come
he
surely
will
close
all
the
roads
of
all
the
world
road
is
open
do
you
believe
that
is
true
not
for
me
he
answered
in
a
hoarse
voice
so
bitter
so
resentful
that
it
startled
her
coming
as
it
did
after
long
silence
he
gripped
the
arms
of
his
chair
again
as
if
in
pain
too
great
to
endure
and
then
burst
out
vehemently
road
is
closed
to
me
now
it
would
be
so
hard
if
there
was
any
prospect
of
the
end
coming
soon
but
i
may
have
to
hang
on
this
way
for
years
just
a
living
death
caged
in
this
helpless
hulk
of
a
body
a
drag
on
every
one
and
a
misery
to
myself
if
i
could
only
end
it
all
oh
jack
begged
mary
starting
up
tears
in
her
eyes
do
talk
that
way
you
not
a
drag
on
anybody
we
could
live
without
you
you
been
so
brave
just
like
aldebaran
in
the
jester
sword
bravely
did
he
bear
his
lot
it
seemed
a
kingly
spirit
dwelt
among
us
do
you
know
that
just
having
you
with
us
is
more
to
us
than
anything
else
in
the
whole
world
she
was
fairly
wringing
her
hands
in
her
distress
over
this
revelation
of
the
overwhelming
bitterness
of
jack
soul
for
months
he
had
been
so
cheerful
hiding
his
real
feelings
under
a
playfulness
of
manner
that
it
was
a
shock
to
her
to
find
that
his
cheerfulness
was
only
assumed
because
he
had
met
his
hurt
so
bravely
and
made
no
sign
she
like
the
jester
thought
the
struggle
had
grown
easier
with
time
and
that
he
really
felt
the
gladness
that
he
feigned
like
the
jester
too
she
was
at
her
wit
end
for
a
reply
she
could
think
of
no
word
of
comfort
the
loud
halloo
which
sounded
just
then
in
a
familiar
voice
from
up
the
creek
was
a
welcome
interruption
the
next
instant
norman
came
in
sight
around
the
curve
he
was
standing
up
in
a
boat
poling
down
stream
towards
them
with
the
vigor
and
skill
of
a
young
indian
it
was
a
clumsy
affair
with
the
swan
painted
in
blue
letters
on
the
side
she
mine
for
the
winter
he
announced
joyfully
as
soon
as
he
was
within
speaking
distance
a
man
who
lives
up
past
klein
crossing
rented
it
to
me
i
to
chop
wood
awhile
every
saturday
to
pay
for
the
use
of
it
norman
was
so
interested
in
his
new
possession
that
he
could
not
see
that
he
had
interrupted
a
conversation
of
tragic
seriousness
come
on
and
get
in
mary
he
urged
it
great
beats
those
old
rafts
you
used
to
pole
at
lee
ranch
all
hollow
do
you
want
to
try
it
mary
hesitated
to
go
off
and
leave
jack
sitting
on
the
unable
to
accompany
her
would
emphasize
his
crippled
condition
to
refuse
to
leave
him
would
only
be
added
proof
in
his
present
sensitive
mood
that
he
was
a
drag
on
every
one
the
sun
is
dropping
so
low
we
ought
to
be
starting
home
before
it
begins
to
get
chilly
she
said
with
a
meaning
glance
towards
jack
which
to
her
relief
norman
interpreted
aright
he
answered
cheerfully
oh
go
on
it
a
cinch
wo
get
chilly
if
you
push
that
old
boat
along
as
fast
as
i
did
and
if
we
get
cold
waiting
for
you
it
wo
be
many
minutes
till
we
be
down
the
bowling
green
towards
home
all
right
then
said
mary
climbing
in
as
he
climbed
out
to
hold
the
boat
steady
for
her
i
wo
go
far
but
i
surely
glad
to
get
out
on
the
water
again
she
took
the
oar
he
handed
her
and
with
a
skilful
push
against
the
bank
she
sent
the
boat
gliding
out
into
the
stream
as
she
went
off
she
thought
that
was
considerate
of
norman
to
put
it
the
way
he
did
to
include
jack
with
himself
as
a
matter
of
course
and
not
to
remind
him
of
his
helplessness
by
saying
he
stay
and
take
care
of
him
norman
has
lots
of
tact
for
a
boy
of
his
age
more
than
i
have
i
must
have
hurt
jack
many
a
time
by
my
inconsiderate
speeches
but
i
had
no
idea
he
felt
so
horribly
sensitive
about
being
dependent
all
the
way
up
the
creek
she
was
so
occupied
with
thinking
of
what
jack
had
said
and
so
depressed
over
the
depths
of
mental
suffering
which
his
exclamations
revealed
that
she
plied
her
oar
mechanically
only
partly
awake
to
the
scenes
about
her
but
the
long
even
strokes
first
on
one
side
and
then
the
other
sent
her
darting
forward
through
the
water
so
rapidly
that
she
soon
reached
a
turn
in
the
creek
which
she
had
never
passed
before
and
as
she
rounded
the
curve
such
a
beautiful
sight
greeted
her
that
she
cried
out
in
pleased
surprise
how
perfectly
on
one
side
the
bank
towered
up
into
a
high
steep
cliff
straight
as
a
wall
it
was
completely
covered
with
ferns
delicate
feathery
ferns
as
luxuriantly
green
as
in
in
this
sheltered
spot
they
were
still
left
untouched
by
the
frost
although
it
was
now
december
everywhere
else
vegetation
was
dry
and
sere
but
the
green
freshness
of
this
bank
was
accounted
for
by
a
number
of
tiny
splashing
down
from
unseen
springs
above
and
sending
a
light
spray
in
every
direction
as
fine
as
mist
i
coming
straight
back
here
in
the
morning
she
said
to
herself
and
dig
up
a
lot
of
these
ferns
before
the
frost
gets
them
i
think
of
anything
lovelier
to
send
to
gay
for
a
christmas
greeting
than
a
clump
of
them
growing
in
a
box
a
rustic
box
covered
with
bark
and
dainty
lichens
one
would
be
nice
for
rochester
too
she
just
the
kind
that
would
appreciate
such
a
gift
well
that
solves
two
of
my
hardest
problems
of
what
to
give
that
trip
up
the
creek
in
was
a
voyage
of
discovery
in
more
ways
than
one
for
mary
came
upon
the
fact
that
she
had
grown
older
in
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
quite
as
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
as
she
had
come
upon
the
that
cry
of
jack
heavens
if
i
could
only
end
it
all
had
shocked
her
into
a
deeper
understanding
of
pain
and
human
limits
of
endurance
she
had
always
prided
herself
on
her
ability
to
imagine
herself
in
other
people
places
and
until
now
had
believed
that
she
fully
understood
and
appreciated
the
depths
of
jack
suffering
now
she
saw
that
she
had
not
even
begun
to
fathom
it
his
bravery
had
deceived
her
all
the
while
that
she
had
been
thinking
that
he
was
growing
accustomed
to
his
lot
and
that
time
was
making
it
easier
for
him
to
bear
a
fire
of
rebellion
was
smouldering
fiercely
within
him
making
each
day
one
of
new
torture
illustration
mary
ware
in
texas
she
sent
the
boat
down
stream
with
long
swift
strokes
because
she
could
plaster
up
her
own
small
hurts
with
platitudes
and
proverbs
and
ease
her
disappointments
by
counting
her
blessings
as
one
would
count
the
beads
upon
a
rosary
she
had
vainly
imagined
that
all
this
would
be
balm
for
him
how
many
times
she
had
offered
him
such
comfort
feeling
with
childish
complacency
that
she
was
helping
to
ease
his
pain
she
understood
now
a
sugarplum
may
help
one
to
forget
a
but
a
is
another
matter
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
she
sent
the
boat
down
stream
with
long
swift
strokes
not
noticing
how
fast
it
was
going
helped
by
the
current
she
came
in
sight
of
jack
and
norman
before
she
had
mentally
adjusted
herself
to
her
new
she
was
afraid
that
as
soon
as
she
and
jack
were
left
alone
again
they
would
find
themselves
facing
the
same
wall
of
blank
despair
and
she
dreaded
it
so
to
gain
time
she
began
calling
to
them
about
the
wonderful
bank
of
ferns
she
had
discovered
and
made
several
awkward
thrusts
of
the
oar
in
an
attempt
to
land
before
she
finally
ran
the
boat
up
on
the
bank
but
norman
did
not
leave
them
alone
deciding
that
that
secluded
spot
would
be
a
good
place
to
chain
the
boat
and
that
it
was
time
to
be
doing
his
evening
chores
he
slipped
the
padlock
key
in
his
pocket
and
handed
the
oar
over
to
mary
saying
you
carry
this
and
i
wheel
the
chair
jack
had
taken
a
new
grip
on
his
courage
and
if
mary
could
have
but
known
it
it
was
by
the
help
of
one
of
the
very
means
she
had
branded
as
futile
a
few
moments
before
the
sight
of
the
bloodstone
on
his
as
he
glanced
at
the
time
recalled
the
story
of
the
poor
jester
who
had
been
born
in
mars
month
like
himself
and
for
that
reason
had
cause
to
claim
undaunted
courage
as
the
jewel
of
his
soul
the
merest
flicker
of
a
smile
crossed
jack
lips
as
he
looked
down
at
the
bloodstone
and
thought
of
all
it
stood
for
and
pulling
himself
together
he
whispered
the
jester
vow
between
clenched
teeth
i
keep
my
oath
until
the
going
down
of
one
more
sun
when
mary
joined
them
he
was
chaffing
norman
quite
as
usual
and
immediately
began
to
joke
about
the
awkward
landing
she
had
made
on
the
way
home
norman
laughed
often
thinking
that
jack
was
in
one
of
his
jolliest
moods
but
mary
walked
beside
them
the
oar
over
her
shoulder
saying
to
herself
and
under
all
this
brave
show
feeling
every
minute
that
he
be
glad
to
when
she
reached
the
house
ware
met
them
at
the
door
and
mary
passing
in
quietly
as
norman
began
telling
about
the
boat
suddenly
remembered
that
that
was
not
the
natural
way
for
her
to
come
home
whenever
she
had
any
news
she
fairly
tumbled
into
the
house
in
her
haste
to
tell
it
the
boys
knew
that
she
had
discovered
the
bank
of
ferns
and
that
it
was
as
exciting
as
norman
discovery
of
a
boat
because
it
would
provide
some
of
her
christmas
presents
without
cost
yet
here
she
was
walking
in
as
calmly
as
if
she
were
fifty
years
old
and
had
outgrown
her
girlish
enthusiasms
it
certainly
was
not
natural
so
she
turned
back
and
interrupted
norman
because
that
was
what
she
always
did
when
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
tell
things
and
she
tried
to
make
her
description
as
full
of
life
and
color
as
she
usually
did
but
all
the
time
she
had
a
feeling
that
she
was
acting
ware
expressed
her
interest
with
many
pleased
exclamations
as
she
always
did
when
mary
came
to
her
with
any
cause
for
rejoicing
but
mary
suddenly
grown
keen
of
vision
saw
the
look
of
anxiety
and
weariness
that
seemed
to
lie
in
the
back
of
her
eyes
behind
the
smile
i
wonder
she
mused
if
mamma
is
acting
too
if
her
gladness
is
only
on
the
surface
and
she
smiles
to
keep
up
her
courage
and
ours
as
they
say
little
boys
whistle
in
the
dark
oh
it
dreadful
to
grow
up
if
one
has
to
lose
faith
in
this
being
a
good
old
world
it
used
to
seem
so
happy
all
the
time
and
now
it
all
so
sorrowful
and
out
of
joint
she
went
into
her
room
to
wash
her
hands
and
get
an
apron
before
going
out
into
the
kitchen
to
help
prepare
supper
as
she
stood
tying
the
she
looked
up
at
lloyd
sherman
picture
which
hung
over
her
bed
as
it
used
to
hang
in
warwick
hall
and
at
lone
rock
when
she
pretended
that
it
was
lloyd
the
chum
to
whom
she
could
carry
all
her
troubles
sure
of
silent
sympathy
but
somehow
while
the
beautiful
eyes
smiled
down
into
hers
as
kindly
as
they
had
always
done
they
did
not
bring
the
sense
of
her
presence
they
did
not
speak
to
her
as
they
had
done
those
other
times
when
she
turned
to
them
for
the
imagined
communion
that
always
brightened
her
spirits
it
never
seemed
the
same
since
i
knew
she
was
engaged
mary
thought
with
a
sigh
of
course
i
know
she
just
as
fond
of
me
as
she
was
before
but
i
ca
help
feeling
that
she
so
taken
up
with
other
things
now
her
life
so
heavenly
full
since
she
has
found
her
prince
that
she
take
the
same
interest
in
my
affairs
as
she
passed
the
mirror
she
turned
back
for
a
second
glance
the
first
had
shown
her
the
fresh
unlined
face
of
a
girl
of
seventeen
but
judging
by
the
way
she
felt
she
was
sure
there
should
be
wrinkles
the
weight
of
and
disillusionment
and
foreboding
which
depressed
her
certainly
could
not
belong
to
youth
they
must
be
the
property
of
an
old
woman
in
her
sixties
at
least
chapter
vii
christmas
ten
days
before
christmas
mary
opened
the
bottom
drawer
of
her
bureau
in
which
she
had
placed
each
gift
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
and
sitting
down
on
the
floor
beside
it
proceeded
to
take
an
inventory
of
the
packages
within
they
were
all
wrapped
stamped
and
addressed
but
she
had
made
them
ready
without
a
single
christmas
thrill
there
was
nothing
in
the
climate
or
surroundings
to
suggest
the
holiday
season
and
she
compared
this
year
preparations
with
the
year
before
at
warwick
hall
when
the
very
air
seemed
charged
with
a
spirit
of
delightful
expectancy
when
everybody
had
secrets
and
went
around
smiling
and
humming
snatches
of
carols
which
the
were
practising
for
the
service
in
the
chapel
mechanically
she
counted
the
bundles
and
checked
them
off
her
list
the
ones
for
holland
for
joyce
for
eugenia
the
bunny
doll
with
the
chamois
skin
head
which
she
had
made
for
little
patricia
she
was
very
well
satisfied
with
them
all
as
well
as
with
the
fancy
trifles
she
had
made
for
lloyd
and
betty
and
the
girls
at
school
with
whom
she
still
kept
up
a
correspondence
they
were
inexpensive
but
they
were
original
and
appropriate
allowing
for
the
crowded
condition
of
the
mails
she
decided
that
the
packages
which
had
the
longest
distance
to
go
should
be
started
that
very
day
these
she
took
from
the
drawer
and
piled
on
her
bed
and
then
got
out
her
pen
to
begin
the
writing
of
her
christmas
letters
now
one
may
make
all
sorts
of
dainty
gifts
and
tie
them
with
holly
ribbon
and
send
them
away
in
christmasy
looking
packages
which
will
bring
a
glow
to
the
heart
of
the
one
who
opens
them
and
yet
do
it
all
without
one
spark
of
festal
feeling
herself
but
it
is
impossible
to
write
a
christmas
letter
and
put
the
proper
zest
into
its
greetings
unless
one
is
with
it
when
mary
discovered
that
fact
she
tore
up
the
sheets
on
which
she
had
made
various
beginnings
and
put
the
cork
in
her
i
ca
do
it
any
more
than
i
could
keep
thanksgiving
on
the
fourth
of
july
or
new
year
on
april
fool
day
she
thought
luckily
the
letters
travel
faster
than
mail
so
i
take
my
packages
to
the
now
and
then
go
out
in
the
boat
awhile
and
think
about
snow
and
and
holly
berries
till
i
work
myself
up
to
the
proper
mood
as
she
started
out
of
the
door
her
mother
called
to
her
to
remind
her
that
they
needed
eggs
that
meant
that
mary
was
to
go
around
by
the
metz
place
to
get
them
on
her
way
home
which
would
take
so
much
longer
that
there
would
be
much
time
for
meditation
in
the
boat
but
it
was
in
going
for
the
eggs
that
she
came
across
the
very
inspiration
of
which
she
was
in
quest
metz
and
his
wife
were
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
sunny
garden
near
the
kitchen
door
when
mary
opened
the
gate
looking
up
the
path
between
the
stiff
rows
of
coxcombs
and
prince
feather
she
could
see
that
the
old
lady
was
knitting
as
usual
he
sat
with
a
newspaper
across
his
knees
and
his
spectacles
folded
in
one
hand
the
other
grasped
the
end
of
his
long
white
beard
which
flowed
almost
to
his
lap
they
were
both
singing
singing
with
the
quavering
voices
of
age
a
song
which
they
had
brought
with
them
from
their
far
away
youth
in
the
beloved
fatherland
it
was
a
song
of
christmas
joy
which
they
had
carolled
many
a
time
around
a
tree
their
voices
were
thin
and
tremulous
and
broke
now
and
then
on
the
high
notes
but
it
was
a
gay
little
tune
very
sweet
and
full
of
cheer
and
mary
who
stopped
to
listen
just
inside
the
gate
was
thankful
that
they
had
not
heard
the
latch
click
when
it
came
to
an
end
she
waited
a
moment
hoping
there
would
be
another
verse
but
they
began
to
talk
and
she
started
on
up
the
path
but
halfway
to
the
house
she
paused
again
for
they
had
begun
another
song
weinachtsbaum
die
lichter
brennen
their
voices
came
to
a
sudden
stop
at
the
end
of
that
line
however
as
they
became
aware
of
an
approaching
visitor
mary
hurried
forward
saying
oh
i
understood
one
word
of
it
you
were
singing
about
a
christmas
tree
were
you
the
children
in
the
blue
cottages
across
from
us
have
been
talking
about
a
all
week
please
stop
it
sounded
so
sweet
as
i
came
in
at
the
gate
at
some
other
time
the
old
couple
might
have
been
hard
to
persuade
but
the
holiday
season
was
their
of
the
year
and
its
return
always
swept
them
along
with
a
rush
of
happy
memories
to
a
state
of
enjoyment
that
was
almost
childish
in
its
outward
manifestation
finding
that
mary
was
really
interested
in
hearing
them
talk
of
the
customs
of
their
youth
they
began
a
series
of
reminiscences
so
interesting
that
she
could
have
listened
all
day
seventy
christmases
they
could
remember
distinctly
besides
the
dim
impressions
of
several
earlier
ones
in
the
course
of
describing
them
it
came
about
quite
naturally
that
they
should
sing
her
the
interrupted
song
the
old
man
because
he
spoke
better
english
than
his
wife
interpreted
the
verses
first
but
even
his
speech
was
halting
and
broken
and
he
pulled
his
white
beard
desperately
and
used
many
despairing
gestures
when
he
could
not
find
the
right
word
she
clicking
her
needles
kept
up
a
constant
nodding
while
he
explained
on
the
christmas
tree
the
lights
are
burning
the
children
gaze
at
the
what
you
call
it
picture
scene
till
the
eye
laughs
and
the
heart
laughs
and
the
old
look
himmelwartz
heavenwards
that
means
with
blessed
rapture
yah
yah
nodded
the
old
wife
prompting
him
as
he
paused
zwei
engel
two
angels
appear
he
repeated
going
haltingly
on
with
the
next
verse
mary
could
not
understand
all
that
he
tried
to
convey
but
she
caught
the
meaning
of
the
last
part
that
the
day
brings
god
blessing
to
young
and
old
alike
to
the
white
as
well
as
the
brown
hair
it
is
the
same
all
over
the
world
he
said
clearing
his
throat
preparatory
to
singing
the
lines
he
had
just
translated
we
will
be
alone
this
year
we
can
not
go
to
our
children
and
they
can
not
come
to
us
but
we
shall
not
feel
alone
we
will
make
ready
one
little
tree
and
in
our
hearts
we
will
join
hands
with
all
the
happy
ones
who
greet
the
we
will
be
part
of
that
circle
which
reaches
around
the
whole
wide
world
the
quavering
old
voices
took
up
the
tune
and
although
mary
recognized
only
three
words
angels
and
heavenward
there
was
something
in
the
zest
with
which
they
sung
it
something
in
the
expression
of
the
wrinkled
old
faces
which
gave
her
the
inspiration
she
was
in
search
of
it
was
as
if
she
had
brought
to
them
a
little
unlighted
candle
and
they
had
kindled
it
at
the
flame
of
their
own
glowing
ones
when
mary
went
home
she
was
more
like
her
accustomed
self
than
she
had
been
for
days
she
went
dancing
into
the
house
with
the
eggs
and
immediately
set
about
the
writing
of
her
christmas
letters
in
her
usual
resourceful
way
ware
looked
up
much
amused
to
see
her
piling
some
fresh
orange
peel
and
bits
of
broken
cedar
on
the
table
beside
her
there
nothing
like
that
combination
of
smells
to
make
you
think
that
santa
claus
is
coming
straight
down
the
chimney
exclaimed
mary
gravely
catching
her
mother
amused
glance
you
may
think
it
is
foolish
but
really
it
makes
all
the
christmases
i
have
ever
known
stand
right
up
in
a
row
in
front
of
me
whenever
i
smell
that
smell
she
rubbed
a
bit
of
the
fresh
peel
and
then
a
piece
of
the
cedar
between
her
palms
to
bring
out
the
pungent
fragrance
and
afterwards
from
time
to
time
bent
over
it
for
another
whiff
to
bring
her
new
inspiration
by
the
twentieth
of
december
the
last
letter
and
the
last
package
but
one
was
started
on
its
way
gay
box
of
ferns
a
mass
of
luxuriant
feathery
greenness
sat
on
a
waiting
for
its
time
to
go
the
crate
in
which
it
was
to
be
shipped
stood
ready
in
the
even
to
the
address
on
the
then
time
began
to
drag
the
next
two
days
although
the
shortest
in
the
year
seemed
many
times
longer
than
usual
it
like
trying
to
keep
things
hot
when
somebody
is
late
and
keeps
dinner
waiting
complained
mary
if
you
ca
eat
when
it
all
ready
some
of
the
things
are
sure
to
dry
up
and
some
to
get
cold
i
was
worked
up
to
quite
a
festive
state
of
mind
day
before
yesterday
but
my
enthusiasm
is
all
drying
up
and
cooling
off
now
here
something
to
warm
it
over
again
announced
norman
coming
in
from
the
express
office
with
a
box
on
his
shoulder
here
the
first
gift
to
arrive
let
open
up
right
now
and
open
each
thing
that
comes
after
this
it
comes
instead
of
waiting
for
one
grand
surprise
on
christmas
morning
you
never
will
try
my
way
and
it
would
spread
the
pleasure
out
and
make
it
last
lots
longer
if
you
only
would
bound
to
get
more
enjoyment
out
of
each
thing
if
you
give
your
undivided
attention
to
it
for
once
norman
suggestion
made
yearly
was
not
opposed
and
as
he
pried
the
lid
off
the
box
mary
flopped
down
on
the
floor
beside
it
jack
wheeled
his
chair
closer
and
ware
came
in
from
the
next
room
in
answer
to
their
eager
calls
that
it
was
from
joyce
each
one
of
the
studio
family
had
contributed
to
the
filling
of
the
box
the
on
top
tied
with
great
bows
of
wide
red
ribbon
were
from
miss
henrietta
robbins
do
you
know
exclaimed
mary
as
she
lifted
them
out
and
held
them
up
for
them
all
to
admire
that
miss
henrietta
has
turned
that
studio
into
a
perfect
bower
of
christmas
greens
she
gives
it
all
the
elegant
costly
touches
that
joyce
never
could
afford
just
as
she
put
the
finishing
touch
on
these
wreaths
with
this
beautiful
ribbon
it
wide
enough
and
satiny
enough
for
a
sash
and
is
it
just
like
little
boyd
to
send
she
cried
a
moment
later
when
the
opening
of
a
fancy
pasteboard
box
revealed
a
doll
about
six
inches
long
dressed
like
a
ballet
dancer
its
fluffy
scarlet
skirts
hid
the
leaves
of
a
concealed
among
its
folds
and
from
the
ends
of
the
sash
by
which
it
was
intended
to
dangle
hung
a
tiny
emery
bag
in
the
shape
of
a
strawberry
and
a
little
silk
she
got
the
idea
for
that
from
the
ladies
home
magazine
i
am
sure
she
adores
the
pages
that
tell
how
to
evolve
your
entire
spring
outfit
from
a
and
a
strip
of
embroidery
it
not
that
she
trying
to
economize
joyce
says
she
has
the
habit
the
girls
tease
her
about
not
being
able
to
see
a
scrap
of
goods
without
wishing
to
find
some
way
to
use
it
but
they
love
the
homey
flavor
her
things
give
to
the
house
she
is
as
and
dear
in
her
ways
as
she
is
in
her
ideas
of
art
that
is
an
unusually
pretty
doll
remarked
ware
as
mary
swung
it
around
by
its
sash
yes
she
answered
it
the
kind
hazel
lee
and
i
were
always
wishing
for
ours
were
flaxen
haired
and
this
has
raven
curls
we
would
have
called
her
agatha
if
we
had
had
her
then
i
believe
i
name
her
that
now
she
added
with
a
glance
towards
jack
to
see
if
he
understood
the
allusion
but
jack
was
not
noticing
he
was
turning
the
pages
of
a
handsomely
illustrated
work
on
geology
a
book
he
had
long
wanted
to
own
joyce
had
had
little
to
spend
this
year
compared
with
last
but
in
her
hurried
shopping
expeditions
she
had
considered
the
tastes
and
needs
of
each
one
so
well
that
every
gift
was
hailed
with
delight
norman
way
is
a
dandy
one
acknowledged
mary
as
she
opened
a
box
of
fine
stationery
engraved
with
her
monogram
the
first
she
had
ever
owned
now
i
can
write
my
note
to
gay
on
this
if
we
had
waited
i
should
have
had
to
use
the
common
paper
that
we
buy
at
the
by
the
pound
because
it
is
cheap
and
it
so
nice
too
to
have
these
beforehand
she
danced
away
to
hang
them
in
the
windows
and
to
swing
the
lady
agatha
from
a
corner
of
the
mirror
over
her
bureau
where
her
hidden
could
readily
be
reached
then
she
thriftily
gathered
up
every
bit
of
ribbon
and
tinsel
from
the
discarded
wrappings
smoothed
out
the
tissue
paper
and
picked
loose
from
it
all
the
adhering
seals
that
had
not
been
broken
in
the
process
of
tearing
open
the
packages
here
seven
whole
seals
with
holly
on
them
she
announced
to
her
mother
six
with
santa
claus
heads
and
four
with
the
greeting
merry
christmas
i
going
to
use
them
over
again
in
doing
up
the
rest
of
my
packages
that
box
that
the
doll
came
in
is
exactly
what
i
want
to
put
the
candy
in
that
i
made
for
the
barnabys
and
that
plain
one
that
holds
the
stuffed
dates
that
lucy
boyd
sent
will
do
for
the
candy
i
going
to
send
and
metz
all
i
need
to
do
is
to
cover
it
with
some
of
this
holly
paper
and
tie
it
with
the
same
gold
cord
i
find
a
use
for
nearly
everything
i
saved
before
the
week
is
over
she
said
it
in
a
tone
of
such
deep
satisfaction
that
norman
looked
up
from
the
book
and
other
gifts
in
which
he
had
seemed
absorbed
to
laugh
at
her
mary
is
like
that
old
woman
who
wrote
those
recipes
for
cheap
pies
in
that
old
new
england
we
have
at
home
he
said
to
his
mother
she
thinks
little
ingenuity
added
to
almost
any
material
that
comes
to
hand
will
make
a
tasty
pie
you
ought
to
send
the
ladies
home
magazine
some
pointers
mary
on
to
make
christmas
gifts
for
others
on
the
wrappings
of
those
sent
did
some
one
say
something
about
the
habit
awhile
ago
mary
only
answer
was
a
saucy
grimace
she
could
afford
to
let
him
tease
her
about
her
squirrel
instinct
for
hoarding
when
it
gave
her
so
much
satisfaction
to
add
to
her
store
of
scraps
she
had
all
sorts
of
things
to
draw
on
in
emergencies
in
the
one
month
they
had
been
in
bauer
she
had
nearly
filled
a
with
odds
and
ends
she
had
sheets
of
saved
from
packages
of
chocolate
picture
cards
little
bottles
and
boxes
and
various
samples
of
toilet
articles
sent
out
by
firms
who
advertise
their
goods
in
that
way
for
the
next
two
days
every
mail
brought
greetings
and
remembrances
to
some
one
of
the
family
sometimes
to
all
so
that
the
hours
slipped
by
at
a
fairly
rapid
pace
one
of
the
gifts
which
gave
mary
most
pleasure
was
the
chiffon
scarf
that
lloyd
sent
it
was
like
the
one
roberta
wore
the
first
evening
mary
had
seen
her
and
which
she
rapturously
compared
to
a
moonbeam
spangled
with
only
she
thought
hers
far
lovelier
than
roberta
a
dozen
times
a
day
she
slipped
into
her
room
to
take
the
floating
filmy
web
from
its
box
and
spread
it
out
to
gloat
over
it
she
had
to
try
the
effects
of
different
lights
on
it
sunshine
and
moonlight
and
the
rays
of
the
lamp
she
spread
it
over
different
dresses
white
pink
and
green
to
see
which
produced
the
prettiest
glimmers
and
norman
caught
her
once
posing
before
a
mirror
with
it
draped
over
head
and
teased
her
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
betty
gift
was
a
simple
inexpensive
one
intended
merely
as
a
greeting
it
was
only
a
green
candle
but
the
card
tied
to
it
by
a
scarlet
bow
bore
the
verse
this
candle
tongue
of
flame
bears
message
prithee
hear
it
it
burns
mid
your
christmas
greens
i
with
you
all
in
spirit
i
glad
that
it
a
big
fat
candle
said
mary
passing
it
around
for
each
one
to
enjoy
the
spicy
aromatic
fragrance
it
burn
a
long
time
she
lighted
it
christmas
eve
and
put
it
in
the
centre
of
the
table
with
one
of
the
laid
around
the
base
and
the
tongue
of
flame
did
seem
to
bear
message
it
started
mary
to
talking
of
her
absent
friend
of
the
bloodstone
and
the
good
times
book
betty
had
given
her
of
betty
clear
brown
eyes
and
dearer
ways
of
betty
sweet
consideration
for
others
of
her
talent
for
writing
which
was
sure
to
make
her
famous
some
day
she
talked
of
her
all
during
supper
not
noticing
that
jack
was
unusually
silent
and
that
his
eyes
rested
oftener
on
the
candle
than
it
did
on
his
plate
as
they
left
the
table
metz
appeared
at
the
door
like
a
veritable
old
santa
claus
with
his
long
white
beard
and
eyes
in
one
arm
he
carried
a
big
round
full
of
nuts
in
the
other
two
bottles
of
wine
his
own
pecan
trees
and
vineyard
had
furnished
his
offering
he
thanked
them
so
volubly
in
his
broken
way
for
the
little
gifts
that
norman
had
carried
over
when
he
went
for
the
milk
and
delivered
his
nuts
and
wine
with
such
benign
smiles
and
a
flow
of
good
wishes
from
his
wife
and
himself
that
mary
gave
a
skip
of
pleasure
when
she
closed
the
door
after
him
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
singing
jingle
jingle
come
kris
kringle
oh
i
feel
as
if
the
old
fellow
himself
had
really
been
here
he
and
betty
candle
have
given
me
a
real
feeling
lovely
they
had
had
supper
so
early
that
it
was
barely
dusk
outdoors
when
she
and
norman
started
to
take
the
box
of
ferns
to
the
rectory
when
they
had
passed
the
cotton
field
the
bend
in
the
road
soon
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
the
village
and
the
beginning
of
the
short
thoroughfare
which
led
to
the
main
street
past
the
and
the
free
the
free
was
always
an
interesting
place
to
both
of
them
and
they
never
passed
it
without
looking
in
it
was
a
large
lot
surrounded
by
a
high
board
fence
low
sheds
were
built
along
one
side
within
the
enclosure
in
which
both
men
and
beasts
might
find
shelter
in
time
of
storm
usually
they
slept
in
the
open
however
with
little
campfires
here
and
there
to
boil
their
coffee
and
give
them
light
peddlers
hucksters
and
belated
country
people
were
its
usual
patrons
but
sometimes
one
saw
a
family
of
armadillo
hunters
on
their
way
to
the
curio
dealers
with
crates
full
of
the
queer
shells
which
can
be
made
into
baskets
simply
by
tying
the
head
and
tail
together
one
evening
mary
saw
two
country
belles
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
their
toilets
behind
a
wagon
by
the
aid
of
a
they
had
come
in
for
one
of
the
saturday
night
balls
held
regularly
in
the
town
hall
the
week
before
part
of
a
disbanded
freak
show
had
taken
refuge
in
the
norman
peeping
through
a
the
gate
being
shut
had
seen
the
armless
man
scratch
a
match
and
light
a
fire
with
his
toes
it
was
deserted
except
for
a
dilapidated
covered
wagon
which
had
driven
in
a
few
minutes
before
it
was
drawn
by
a
big
bony
horse
and
a
dejected
little
burro
and
piled
high
with
household
goods
a
gaunt
man
with
a
week
stubble
of
red
beard
on
his
chin
was
beginning
to
unhitch
his
wife
who
was
only
a
young
thing
and
pretty
in
a
worn
faded
way
put
down
the
sleeping
baby
that
she
had
been
holding
and
stretched
her
arms
wearily
she
seemed
too
tired
and
listless
to
move
till
one
of
the
two
children
who
were
climbing
down
over
the
wheel
fell
and
began
to
whimper
a
pair
of
hounds
that
had
trailed
along
behind
dropped
down
under
the
wagon
as
if
they
had
followed
a
long
way
and
were
utterly
exhausted
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
forlorn
in
all
your
life
exclaimed
norman
as
they
passed
on
and
christmas
eve
too
i
do
suppose
those
poor
little
kids
will
have
a
thing
no
i
suppose
not
answered
mary
it
seems
a
shame
too
when
there
probably
be
a
tree
in
every
house
in
bauer
metz
says
that
is
one
custom
that
they
keep
up
here
as
faithfully
as
they
do
in
the
old
country
even
the
poorest
families
will
manage
to
get
one
somehow
those
were
cute
kids
norman
went
on
too
much
interested
in
what
he
had
just
seen
to
put
the
subject
by
that
oldest
little
girl
with
the
yellow
curls
looked
like
a
big
doll
and
the
little
one
is
almost
as
pretty
he
spoke
of
them
again
on
the
way
back
after
they
had
left
the
ferns
at
the
rectory
and
turned
homeward
the
lights
were
beginning
to
twinkle
all
down
the
long
street
in
every
house
they
passed
where
the
shades
had
not
been
drawn
they
could
see
a
tree
standing
all
ready
for
the
lighting
from
base
to
taper
as
they
drew
near
the
again
they
saw
the
man
going
into
the
corner
grocery
with
a
tin
pail
on
his
arm
at
the
gate
they
looked
in
a
small
fire
had
been
started
over
which
a
battered
had
been
set
to
boil
the
burro
and
the
bony
horse
were
munching
fodder
near
the
wagon
but
the
woman
and
the
children
had
disappeared
there
they
are
whispered
mary
pointing
down
the
road
a
little
way
to
a
group
standing
in
front
of
the
pretty
green
and
white
cottage
next
to
the
cotton
gin
the
lace
curtains
had
been
dropped
over
the
windows
but
they
did
not
hide
the
gay
scene
within
the
family
was
having
its
celebration
early
because
the
two
small
lads
for
whom
it
was
designed
were
so
young
that
their
bedtime
came
early
they
were
handsome
little
fellows
one
in
kilts
and
the
other
just
promoted
to
trousers
the
gifts
hanging
from
the
lighted
boughs
were
many
and
costly
the
two
little
ones
outside
looking
in
had
never
seen
anything
so
fine
and
beautiful
before
and
stood
gazing
in
wonder
attracted
by
the
music
they
had
strayed
down
from
the
and
their
mother
had
followed
with
the
sleeping
baby
thrown
across
her
shoulder
to
bring
them
back
now
she
too
stood
and
stared
the
phonograph
was
still
playing
when
mary
and
norman
reached
the
gate
so
they
paused
to
listen
also
more
interested
in
the
watchers
outside
however
than
the
revellers
within
presently
mary
turned
to
the
woman
saying
it
pretty
it
in
such
a
friendly
way
that
her
remark
called
out
an
equally
friendly
response
and
in
a
few
moments
she
had
learned
what
she
wanted
most
to
know
about
the
strangers
they
were
moving
on
to
the
next
county
having
already
been
two
days
and
a
night
on
the
road
her
man
thought
he
could
find
work
in
the
cedar
brakes
they
stood
talking
until
the
phonograph
stopped
then
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
told
the
woman
that
her
husband
was
returning
to
the
wagon
and
she
turned
to
go
the
children
were
loath
to
leave
however
it
their
first
sight
of
sandy
claws
she
remarked
as
if
to
explain
their
unwillingness
then
as
one
of
them
stumbled
and
caught
at
her
skirts
she
added
impatiently
i
reckon
it
likely
to
be
your
last
he
do
care
anything
for
the
likes
of
it
was
said
so
bitterly
that
as
norman
trudged
on
in
the
opposite
direction
with
his
sister
he
exclaimed
in
a
regretful
tone
it
too
bad
that
we
did
find
out
about
them
sooner
in
time
to
fix
something
for
them
it
sort
of
spoils
my
own
christmas
to
think
of
those
kids
going
without
they
are
not
going
without
replied
mary
promptly
who
had
been
thinking
rapidly
as
she
walked
we
got
to
get
something
ready
for
them
before
they
shut
their
eyes
huh
i
like
to
know
how
you
do
it
this
late
norman
answered
she
laughed
in
reply
saying
teasingly
who
was
it
said
that
little
ingenuity
added
to
almost
any
material
that
comes
to
hand
will
make
a
tasty
pie
well
it
will
make
a
tasty
tree
too
if
you
help
have
one
ready
in
an
hour
his
skeptical
i
do
believe
it
why
you
was
all
she
needed
to
start
her
to
working
out
her
resolution
with
the
force
of
a
young
whirlwind
she
could
plan
with
rapidity
when
any
need
arose
i
said
if
you
all
help
she
reminded
him
as
soon
as
he
had
expressed
a
hearty
willingness
to
do
anything
he
could
to
carry
sandy
claws
to
the
she
began
the
minute
we
get
home
you
hack
off
one
of
the
bottom
branches
of
that
cedar
tree
outside
the
gate
a
good
bushy
one
about
three
feet
high
put
it
into
the
box
that
joyce
presents
came
in
and
nail
it
in
place
with
cleats
made
from
the
lid
better
weight
it
with
some
stones
in
the
bottom
and
we
can
tack
green
crêpe
paper
all
over
the
base
nothing
but
ordinary
white
candles
but
we
can
cut
them
in
two
and
wire
them
on
with
hairpins
and
cover
the
pins
with
tinfoil
out
of
my
that
you
make
so
much
fun
of
that
will
be
part
there
some
corn
already
popped
waiting
till
i
get
back
to
be
made
into
balls
i
get
mamma
to
string
it
instead
and
jack
to
make
a
lot
of
little
gilt
cornucopias
out
of
some
stuff
i
saved
i
sure
donate
the
candy
cane
joyce
sent
as
a
joke
although
he
is
so
fond
of
striped
peppermint
sticks
we
break
it
up
into
short
pieces
and
hang
that
on
and
we
can
tie
up
a
few
dates
and
nuts
into
tiny
packages
there
are
fancy
papers
and
ribbons
galore
in
that
aforesaid
i
think
of
more
after
we
get
started
come
on
let
race
the
rest
of
the
way
the
one
who
gets
there
first
can
tell
the
others
norman
reached
the
front
door
several
yards
ahead
of
mary
but
he
did
not
claim
his
privilege
he
merely
rushed
into
the
kitchen
for
a
hatchet
calling
as
he
dashed
out
again
sixty
minutes
to
make
a
christmas
tree
in
everybody
get
to
work
mary
did
not
stop
to
take
off
her
hat
throwing
off
her
coat
she
began
talking
on
the
bounce
as
jack
said
for
she
hurried
from
one
room
to
the
other
explaining
at
the
top
of
her
voice
while
she
gathered
up
and
scissors
her
enthusiasm
was
so
contagious
her
description
of
the
pilgrims
so
appealing
that
by
the
time
she
had
finished
her
breathless
account
of
them
jack
had
begun
cutting
squares
of
gilt
paper
and
ware
was
stringing
corn
as
if
they
were
working
to
win
a
wager
the
race
against
time
was
the
most
exciting
experience
they
had
had
in
bauer
they
watched
the
clock
with
many
laughing
exclamations
but
were
working
too
fast
to
talk
much
in
twenty
minutes
norman
brought
in
a
shapely
little
tree
firmly
fastened
on
a
green
base
in
thirty
minutes
more
the
candles
were
wired
in
place
a
few
skilful
twists
had
turned
part
of
the
tinfoil
into
silvery
ornaments
to
hang
beneath
while
the
rest
had
gone
to
the
making
of
a
great
star
to
blaze
on
the
bough
white
strings
of
were
festooned
around
it
like
garlands
of
snow
every
branch
was
bright
with
gilt
and
silver
and
blue
and
red
packages
holding
only
a
nut
or
a
sweetmeat
it
is
true
but
adding
much
to
the
gay
attire
of
the
tree
a
little
flashed
from
one
bough
a
fancy
sample
bottle
of
perfume
hung
from
another
a
miniature
cake
of
scented
soap
and
many
fluttering
picture
cards
bore
witness
to
the
resources
of
the
then
exclaiming
over
a
sudden
happy
thought
mary
darted
into
the
bedroom
and
took
down
lady
agatha
three
snips
of
the
scissors
robbed
her
of
the
needle
book
hidden
under
her
fluffy
scarlet
skirts
and
of
the
emery
bag
and
thimble
case
tied
to
her
sash
ends
and
left
her
no
longer
useful
only
so
ornamental
that
any
little
girl
would
have
been
glad
to
take
her
to
her
arms
and
affection
i
know
boyd
would
mind
my
passing
it
on
to
those
children
mary
said
as
she
tied
it
to
one
of
the
highest
branches
if
she
knew
that
it
makes
me
happy
as
well
as
them
but
asked
norman
what
if
goldilocks
and
her
sister
both
want
to
play
with
it
at
the
same
time
what
will
the
one
do
mary
thought
an
instant
and
then
flew
to
the
tray
of
her
trunk
to
snatch
out
a
woolly
toy
lamb
that
had
fallen
to
her
lot
from
the
mock
christmas
tree
at
warwick
hall
i
brought
it
down
to
texas
with
me
because
dorene
said
that
that
mary
went
the
lamb
was
sure
to
go
i
expected
to
keep
it
always
as
a
reminder
of
that
lovely
evening
but
with
a
half
stifled
sigh
it
will
do
them
more
good
than
me
when
that
was
in
place
she
gave
one
last
glance
around
the
room
to
see
what
else
she
could
appropriate
her
eyes
fell
on
the
holly
wreaths
those
red
bows
will
make
lovely
she
cried
we
can
spare
two
of
them
hurry
mamma
and
help
me
untie
them
the
may
as
well
go
too
pin
it
on
norman
and
stick
a
date
in
the
thimble
bag
and
swing
it
up
jack
in
the
meantime
norman
had
been
lighting
the
candles
in
order
that
they
might
see
how
it
looked
when
it
was
all
ashine
and
it
stood
now
a
very
creditable
and
a
very
bright
little
tree
there
were
none
of
the
birds
and
crystal
icicles
and
artificial
fruits
that
had
made
little
patricia
tree
such
a
gorgeous
affair
the
year
before
and
were
probably
making
it
beautiful
but
there
was
sparkle
and
color
and
glow
and
charm
of
beribboned
packages
enough
to
make
little
eyes
who
saw
such
a
sight
for
the
first
time
believe
that
it
was
the
work
of
magic
hands
done
cried
mary
triumphantly
and
in
only
minutes
well
i
did
believe
it
would
be
possible
acknowledged
norman
i
bet
it
the
only
tree
in
texas
trimmed
in
such
short
order
when
he
and
mary
reached
the
again
they
found
the
family
sitting
around
the
smouldering
fire
listening
to
the
phonograph
which
was
still
playing
in
the
cottage
down
the
road
the
quilts
were
spread
out
in
the
wagon
ready
for
the
night
but
the
children
who
had
slept
most
of
the
afternoon
on
their
tiresome
journey
could
not
be
induced
to
climb
in
while
the
music
lasted
the
two
bearers
of
cheer
set
the
tree
down
and
reconnoitered
through
cracks
in
the
fence
the
man
looks
awfully
down
in
the
mouth
whispered
norman
so
does
she
shall
we
tell
them
claws
sent
it
no
mary
whispered
back
they
look
so
forlorn
and
friendless
and
the
woman
seemed
to
feel
so
left
out
of
everything
that
it
might
do
them
good
to
tell
them
we
brought
it
because
the
angels
sang
peace
on
earth
to
men
and
that
it
a
sort
of
sign
that
they
left
out
they
to
have
a
part
in
it
too
norman
turned
his
eye
from
the
to
gape
at
her
well
was
his
whispered
ejaculation
if
you
want
all
said
you
have
to
say
it
yourself
i
no
preacher
come
on
then
said
mary
boldly
she
knew
what
she
wanted
to
convey
to
them
but
the
words
stuck
in
her
throat
and
she
never
could
remember
afterwards
exactly
what
she
blurted
out
as
they
put
the
tree
down
in
front
of
the
astonished
family
and
then
turned
and
ran
however
her
words
must
have
carried
some
of
the
good
cheer
she
intended
for
when
she
and
norman
paused
again
outside
she
at
the
this
time
and
he
at
the
crack
it
gave
them
each
a
queer
little
flutter
inside
to
see
the
expression
on
the
pleased
faces
and
hear
their
exclamations
of
wonder
they
could
be
more
surprised
if
it
had
dropped
right
down
out
of
the
sky
whispered
norman
now
the
kids
are
getting
over
their
daze
a
bit
they
hopping
around
just
like
they
saw
the
kramer
boys
do
see
they
found
lady
agatha
answered
mary
just
at
goldilocks
now
did
you
ever
see
such
an
ecstatic
little
face
i
would
have
missed
it
for
anything
now
they
got
the
lamb
i
so
glad
i
thought
of
it
for
the
kramers
had
a
whole
bunch
of
little
white
sheep
around
the
base
of
their
tree
they
were
both
very
quiet
when
they
finally
turned
away
from
the
fence
and
started
home
they
did
not
speak
till
they
reached
the
white
moonlighted
road
stretching
past
the
cotton
field
then
mary
looked
up
at
the
stars
saying
reverently
somehow
i
feel
as
if
we
been
taking
part
in
the
christmas
it
was
a
sort
of
that
the
star
of
bethlehem
led
to
do
you
remember
was
no
room
in
the
for
the
child
and
his
mother
it
was
a
manger
the
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
were
carried
to
i
feel
as
if
we
been
following
along
a
little
way
at
least
on
the
trail
of
the
wise
men
me
too
confessed
norman
then
nothing
more
was
said
for
a
long
time
mary
could
find
no
words
for
the
next
thoughts
which
puzzled
her
she
was
picturing
all
the
christmas
trees
of
the
world
brought
together
in
one
place
and
trying
to
imagine
the
enormous
forest
they
would
make
then
she
fell
to
wondering
what
it
was
about
them
that
should
make
the
eye
laugh
and
the
heart
laugh
and
bring
a
blessing
to
the
silver
hair
as
well
as
brown
as
the
old
couple
had
sung
in
the
garden
all
over
the
world
it
was
so
since
looking
into
the
windows
at
other
peoples
trees
and
then
causing
one
to
bloom
and
bear
fruit
herself
for
the
homeless
campers
she
felt
that
she
had
joined
hands
with
that
circle
which
reaches
around
the
world
she
was
no
longer
an
alien
and
stranger
among
the
people
of
bauer
the
weinachtsbaum
had
given
her
a
happy
bond
of
understanding
and
kinship
it
had
taken
the
hard
hopeless
look
out
of
the
older
faces
around
the
for
awhile
at
least
and
made
the
little
ones
radiant
and
at
home
she
remembered
gratefully
how
jack
had
burst
out
whistling
several
times
while
he
helped
to
trim
it
and
the
tune
that
came
in
such
lusty
rollicking
outbursts
was
one
which
he
never
whistled
except
when
he
was
in
high
good
humor
with
himself
and
all
the
universe
she
was
sure
that
he
was
acting
then
he
could
have
been
just
pretending
that
he
was
glad
for
it
sounded
as
it
always
used
to
do
back
at
the
wigwam
she
wondered
why
the
tree
had
had
that
effect
and
then
like
an
answer
a
verse
popped
into
her
thoughts
one
that
she
had
spelled
out
long
ago
for
grandmother
ware
letter
by
letter
one
little
finger
pointing
to
each
in
turn
it
was
a
verse
from
revelation
about
the
tree
that
stands
on
either
side
of
the
river
clear
as
crystal
bare
twelve
manner
of
fruit
and
the
leaves
were
for
the
healing
of
the
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
understood
why
those
shining
boughs
with
their
strange
fruitage
of
gifts
have
power
to
bring
hope
and
good
cheer
to
lonely
hearts
the
world
over
they
are
the
symbols
which
the
spirit
of
christmas
sets
ashine
of
that
tree
of
life
and
the
spirit
of
christmas
is
only
another
name
for
love
and
it
is
love
alone
the
human
and
divine
together
which
can
bring
about
the
healing
needed
by
hearts
in
every
nation
all
this
did
not
come
to
mary
in
words
she
could
not
have
expressed
it
to
any
one
else
but
it
sent
her
on
her
way
deeply
quietly
glad
next
morning
while
she
was
stooping
before
the
oven
basting
the
turkey
which
the
barnabys
had
sent
with
their
greetings
jack
called
her
to
the
front
window
where
he
was
sitting
a
covered
wagon
was
creaking
slowly
by
drawn
by
a
big
horse
and
a
little
burro
the
cover
was
looped
up
and
in
the
back
end
carefully
tied
to
the
stood
the
tree
which
had
taken
them
minutes
to
prepare
but
whose
memory
would
not
be
effaced
in
that
many
years
from
the
minds
of
the
two
children
seated
on
the
quilts
beside
it
i
so
glad
you
got
to
see
them
said
mary
are
they
dear
and
oh
look
goldilocks
is
still
holding
lady
agatha
and
the
other
hugging
the
woolly
lamb
when
the
wagon
was
entirely
out
of
sight
mary
started
back
to
her
turkey
basting
but
stopped
a
moment
to
take
another
look
at
the
gifts
spread
out
on
the
side
table
several
things
had
been
added
to
them
that
morning
a
dissected
puzzle
picture
which
norman
had
made
for
her
a
spool
case
that
jack
had
whittled
out
and
a
strip
of
exquisitely
embroidered
rosebuds
that
ware
had
wrought
to
be
put
into
a
white
dress
there
was
also
a
pot
of
white
hyacinths
from
the
rectory
and
mary
held
her
face
down
against
the
cool
snow
of
their
blossoms
taking
in
their
sweetness
in
long
breaths
it
been
a
pretty
full
christmas
has
it
exclaimed
jack
as
he
watched
her
it
really
been
one
of
the
nicest
i
ever
had
she
answered
for
one
reason
because
it
lasted
so
long
norman
plan
is
a
success
that
night
after
supper
norman
insisted
on
taking
his
mother
down
into
the
village
to
look
at
the
lighted
windows
after
they
had
gone
mary
took
out
her
good
times
book
to
record
the
happenings
of
the
day
she
had
a
few
more
notes
of
acknowledgment
to
write
also
and
was
glad
that
jack
was
busy
with
his
own
writing
she
noticed
that
he
was
using
india
ink
and
a
pen
but
thought
nothing
of
that
as
he
was
always
experimenting
with
them
joyce
was
not
the
only
one
of
the
children
who
had
inherited
artistic
ability
jack
never
attempted
pictures
but
he
did
beautiful
lettering
odd
initials
and
old
english
script
and
had
copied
verses
for
calendars
and
inscriptions
joyce
said
some
of
his
work
was
as
beautifully
done
as
the
letters
she
had
seen
in
old
missals
made
by
the
monks
nearly
an
hour
went
by
mary
addressed
her
last
envelope
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
pushed
a
narrow
strip
of
cardboard
towards
her
i
made
you
one
more
present
to
end
the
day
with
mary
he
said
jokingly
it
a
bookmark
inside
a
narrow
border
of
conventional
scrollwork
was
one
line
and
the
line
was
from
the
verse
which
she
had
quoted
so
disastrously
that
day
at
the
close
all
the
roads
of
all
the
world
road
is
open
still
as
she
looked
up
to
speak
he
interrupted
her
hurriedly
yes
i
know
how
miserable
i
made
you
that
day
with
my
outburst
against
fate
and
i
felt
that
you
never
believed
me
since
when
i
laughed
and
joked
and
said
that
i
enjoyed
things
but
that
was
only
one
time
that
i
gave
way
just
once
that
i
got
down
in
the
dumps
and
i
do
want
you
to
think
that
is
my
usual
state
of
feelings
really
i
getting
more
out
of
life
than
you
imagine
i
putting
up
the
best
fight
i
can
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
although
every
other
road
in
the
world
is
closed
against
me
i
can
still
scrape
along
pretty
comfortably
because
that
last
line
is
true
love
road
is
open
still
you
all
have
made
it
a
good
wide
one
for
me
and
made
it
worth
while
for
me
to
travel
it
with
you
cheerfully
to
the
end
i
perfectly
willing
to
oh
jack
cried
mary
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
both
joy
and
tears
i
had
a
happy
christmas
but
knowing
you
feel
that
way
is
the
very
best
part
of
all
chapter
viii
die
kleinen
teufel
christmas
was
followed
by
a
week
of
small
calamities
some
of
them
would
have
been
laughable
counted
singly
but
taken
all
together
they
assumed
a
seriousness
not
to
be
considered
lightly
in
the
first
place
mary
attempting
to
tie
the
boat
at
the
usual
landing
slipped
on
the
muddy
bank
and
dropped
the
chain
in
her
effort
to
recover
it
she
stepped
into
the
water
her
shoes
were
soaking
wet
when
she
reached
home
and
as
they
were
her
only
good
ones
she
stuffed
them
carefully
with
paper
and
hung
them
over
the
little
drum
stove
in
the
living
room
to
dry
that
evening
jack
read
aloud
while
they
washed
the
dishes
so
they
were
all
in
the
kitchen
when
the
smouldering
log
in
the
drum
stove
having
reached
the
blazing
point
suddenly
burst
into
flame
presently
a
smell
of
burning
leather
made
them
all
begin
to
sniff
inquiringly
and
mary
rushed
in
to
find
that
one
of
her
shoes
had
dropped
from
the
string
to
which
she
had
tied
it
by
the
laces
and
was
scorching
to
a
crisp
on
the
stove
her
old
shoes
were
so
shabby
that
the
immediate
need
of
new
ones
left
her
figuring
over
the
family
accounts
until
it
was
hard
to
cut
down
a
list
of
expenses
already
reduced
to
low
water
mark
the
next
day
a
wet
norther
blew
up
bringing
the
first
cold
weather
of
the
winter
after
weeks
of
almost
heat
the
mercury
dropped
to
freezing
point
in
just
a
few
hours
and
roaring
fires
in
both
the
kitchen
and
drum
stoves
failed
to
warm
the
little
cottage
like
most
houses
in
that
section
it
had
not
been
built
with
a
view
to
excluding
the
cold
the
wind
blew
in
under
the
north
door
lifting
the
rugs
until
they
shifted
with
a
motion
across
the
floor
jack
had
to
have
a
blanket
hung
behind
his
chair
and
when
ware
sat
down
to
write
her
weekly
letter
to
joyce
the
draughts
that
rattled
the
windows
set
her
to
sneezing
as
if
she
never
could
stop
mary
full
of
resources
brought
her
pink
sunbonnet
and
perched
it
on
her
mother
head
pulling
its
ruffled
cape
well
down
on
her
shoulders
there
she
exclaimed
laughing
at
the
jaunty
effect
that
will
keep
cauld
blasts
from
giving
you
a
stiff
neck
do
look
in
the
mirror
and
then
draw
a
picture
of
yourself
for
joyce
tell
her
that
the
sunny
south
is
a
delusion
the
mercury
is
only
down
to
freezing
but
i
am
sure
that
there
is
an
esquimau
in
all
the
arctic
circle
as
cold
as
we
are
this
blessed
minute
that
wind
goes
through
a
body
like
a
needle
these
little
stoves
fairly
eat
up
the
wood
she
grumbled
a
few
minutes
later
glancing
into
the
empty
which
norman
had
piled
to
the
top
before
he
left
that
morning
norman
will
be
back
soon
said
ware
looking
out
from
her
aureole
of
pink
ruffles
which
she
had
found
such
a
comfortable
shield
from
the
draughts
that
she
left
it
as
mary
had
placed
it
he
fill
the
box
again
as
soon
as
he
comes
but
mary
had
slipped
into
a
coat
and
was
tying
a
veil
over
her
ears
it
is
safe
to
wait
she
answered
we
be
stiff
and
stark
as
icicles
in
no
time
if
we
were
to
let
the
fires
go
out
i
do
mind
being
stoker
it
good
exercise
she
skipped
out
to
the
gaily
enough
but
the
tune
she
was
whistling
changed
to
a
note
of
surprise
and
dismay
when
she
saw
what
inroads
they
had
made
on
it
since
the
last
time
she
had
noticed
it
we
have
to
have
another
cord
right
away
she
thought
i
never
dreamed
that
fuel
would
be
such
a
big
item
of
expense
away
down
here
so
far
south
but
if
we
have
much
more
weather
like
this
it
will
be
a
very
serious
item
the
discovery
sent
her
back
to
her
account
book
again
but
this
time
she
took
it
to
her
own
room
where
jack
could
not
see
her
figuring
the
butcher
raised
the
price
of
meat
that
week
both
butter
and
eggs
went
higher
and
jack
rubber
sprung
such
a
leak
that
it
collapsed
hopelessly
a
new
one
was
a
necessity
then
the
cold
norther
made
jack
rheumatism
so
much
worse
that
he
had
to
stay
in
bed
and
several
visits
from
the
doctor
and
a
druggist
bill
had
to
be
added
to
the
list
of
the
week
calamities
the
last
straw
was
reached
when
joyce
letter
came
deploring
the
fact
that
the
check
which
she
was
enclosing
was
only
half
the
size
which
she
usually
sent
she
had
some
unexpected
expenses
at
the
studio
which
she
was
obliged
to
meet
but
she
hoped
to
send
the
customary
amount
next
month
this
information
was
not
in
the
letter
which
ware
promptly
sent
in
to
jack
by
norman
but
in
a
separate
postscript
folded
inside
the
check
mary
read
it
with
startled
eyes
whatever
are
we
going
to
do
she
asked
in
a
despairing
whisper
ware
shook
her
head
and
sat
folding
and
unfolding
the
check
in
an
way
for
several
minutes
then
she
went
into
her
room
for
pen
and
ink
to
endorse
it
so
that
mary
who
was
going
down
into
the
town
that
afternoon
could
cash
it
she
was
gone
a
long
time
and
when
she
came
back
she
had
two
letters
ready
to
post
as
mary
went
down
the
road
a
while
later
she
glanced
at
the
first
envelope
which
was
addressed
to
joyce
admiring
as
she
always
did
her
mother
penmanship
it
just
like
her
she
thought
so
fine
and
even
and
ladylike
then
she
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
as
she
saw
that
the
second
envelope
was
addressed
to
barnaby
whatever
can
she
be
writing
to
about
she
wondered
it
queer
she
never
said
anything
about
it
when
we
always
talk
over
everything
together
even
the
tiniest
trifles
she
puzzled
over
it
nearly
all
the
way
to
the
till
she
remembered
that
she
had
heard
her
mother
say
that
she
was
not
altogether
satisfied
with
the
new
doctor
treatment
for
jack
and
that
she
wanted
to
ask
barnaby
whom
to
call
in
consultation
satisfied
with
that
solution
mary
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
till
the
following
friday
when
she
came
back
from
a
short
call
at
the
rectory
to
find
that
barnaby
had
just
driven
away
from
the
house
she
was
disappointed
for
these
visits
were
always
hailed
as
joyful
events
by
the
entire
household
i
would
have
missed
her
for
exclaimed
mary
following
her
mother
into
their
bedroom
she
so
diverting
what
particularly
funny
things
did
she
say
this
time
that
her
glance
and
question
indicated
a
bundle
that
her
mother
had
brought
in
from
the
back
doorstep
and
laid
on
the
bed
ware
shook
her
head
meaningly
and
closed
the
door
into
jack
room
before
she
answered
then
she
said
in
a
low
tone
it
some
linen
and
lace
that
barnaby
brought
this
afternoon
i
wrote
to
her
asking
her
if
she
had
any
fine
that
i
could
do
sh
she
whispered
lifting
a
warning
finger
as
mary
cry
of
why
mamma
ware
interrupted
her
jack
will
hear
you
and
he
is
not
to
know
that
why
i
had
pedro
take
the
bundle
to
the
back
door
barnaby
understands
something
had
to
be
done
and
under
the
circumstances
sewing
is
the
only
thing
i
can
turn
my
hand
to
at
home
but
mamma
exclaimed
mary
so
distressed
that
she
was
almost
crying
your
eyes
are
not
strong
enough
for
that
any
more
you
nearly
wore
yourself
out
trying
to
support
us
when
we
were
little
and
i
very
sure
we
not
going
to
allow
it
now
joyce
would
be
terribly
distressed
and
as
for
jack
i
know
perfectly
well
that
he
just
rather
lie
down
and
die
than
have
you
do
it
we
bundle
that
stuff
right
back
to
barnaby
and
i
go
down
town
and
see
if
i
ca
get
a
position
in
one
of
the
stores
ware
answer
was
in
such
a
low
voice
that
it
went
no
farther
than
the
closed
door
but
it
silenced
mary
protests
only
a
few
times
in
her
remembrance
had
the
gentle
little
woman
used
that
tone
of
authority
with
her
children
but
on
those
rare
occasions
they
recognized
the
force
of
her
determination
and
the
uselessness
of
opposing
it
mary
turned
away
distressed
and
sore
over
the
situation
she
said
nothing
more
but
as
she
went
about
her
work
she
kept
wiping
away
the
tears
and
a
fierce
rebellion
raged
inwardly
there
would
have
been
little
said
at
the
that
night
if
norman
had
not
come
home
in
a
talkative
mood
he
was
to
start
to
the
public
high
school
the
following
monday
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
term
and
had
recently
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
boy
lately
come
to
bauer
who
would
enter
with
him
ed
masters
is
his
name
norman
reported
raising
his
voice
a
trifle
so
that
jack
who
was
taking
his
supper
at
the
same
time
from
a
bedside
table
in
the
next
room
might
be
included
in
the
conversation
i
like
him
first
rate
and
it
will
make
it
lots
easier
for
me
at
school
not
to
be
the
only
new
boy
the
only
trouble
is
he
does
know
whether
his
folks
are
going
to
stay
in
bauer
long
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
for
him
to
start
or
not
they
came
for
the
whole
winter
but
they
say
that
they
ca
stand
it
at
the
hotel
many
more
days
if
something
is
done
to
those
mallory
kids
ed
says
they
regular
little
imps
for
mischief
they
been
here
only
two
weeks
but
known
all
over
bauer
as
kleinen
teufel
which
being
interpreted
laughed
jack
from
the
next
room
means
the
little
devils
what
have
they
done
to
earn
such
a
name
it
might
be
easier
to
tell
what
they
have
done
answered
norman
there
two
of
them
the
boy
seven
and
the
girl
eight
but
exactly
the
same
size
and
look
so
much
alike
everybody
takes
them
for
twins
they
put
a
puppy
in
the
freezer
yesterday
morning
ed
says
and
miss
edna
the
landlady
daughter
almost
had
a
spasm
when
she
went
to
make
for
dinner
and
found
it
in
the
can
yesterday
afternoon
the
delivery
wagon
stopped
at
the
side
entrance
of
the
hotel
it
the
williams
house
where
ed
is
staying
and
those
children
waited
until
the
boy
had
gone
in
with
a
basket
of
groceries
then
they
climbed
up
into
the
delivery
wagon
and
changed
the
things
all
around
in
the
other
baskets
so
that
the
orders
were
hopelessly
mixed
up
and
nobody
got
what
he
had
bought
there
was
a
ten
gallon
can
of
kerosene
in
the
wagon
the
kind
that
has
a
pump
attachment
the
boy
stopped
to
talk
a
minute
to
williams
and
by
the
time
he
got
back
they
had
pumped
all
the
kerosene
out
into
the
road
and
were
making
regular
gatling
guns
of
themselves
with
a
bushel
of
potatoes
they
were
firing
them
out
of
the
basket
as
fast
as
they
could
throw
in
a
wild
race
to
see
which
would
be
first
to
grab
the
last
potato
ed
says
they
ride
up
and
down
the
hotel
galleries
on
their
tricycles
till
it
sounds
like
thunder
when
the
other
boarders
are
trying
to
take
a
nap
or
they
chase
up
and
down
hooting
and
slashing
the
air
with
switches
if
people
do
dodge
and
scrooge
back
against
the
wall
they
get
slashed
too
i
suppose
every
merchant
on
main
street
has
some
grievance
against
them
for
they
have
the
slightest
regard
for
other
people
rights
or
property
and
they
not
afraid
of
anything
the
little
girl
went
into
the
livery
stable
the
other
day
and
swung
onto
the
tail
of
one
of
those
big
white
horses
and
pulled
a
handful
of
hairs
out
of
it
it
a
favorite
trick
of
theirs
to
climb
into
any
automobile
left
at
the
curbstone
and
honk
the
horn
till
the
owner
comes
out
then
they
calmly
sit
still
and
demand
a
ride
they
must
be
the
children
that
doctor
mackay
was
telling
me
about
spoke
up
jack
he
came
in
here
one
day
furious
with
them
he
had
caught
them
smearing
soap
over
the
glass
wind
shield
of
his
new
machine
they
had
climbed
all
over
the
cushions
with
their
muddy
feet
and
tinkered
with
the
clock
till
it
could
run
he
threatened
to
tell
their
father
and
all
they
did
was
to
put
their
thumbs
to
their
noses
and
say
you
tell
he
a
thousand
miles
away
is
any
one
responsible
for
them
asked
ware
yes
said
norman
there
is
a
colored
girl
at
their
heels
whenever
they
do
give
her
the
slip
but
their
mother
is
ill
came
here
for
her
health
ed
says
and
their
grandmother
who
tries
to
look
after
them
is
so
deaf
that
she
ca
hear
their
noise
and
their
saucy
speeches
they
so
quick
that
she
never
sees
them
making
faces
and
sticking
their
tongues
out
at
people
they
do
it
behind
her
back
she
thinks
they
are
little
angels
but
she
find
out
when
they
asked
to
leave
the
hotel
ed
says
it
coming
to
that
very
soon
either
the
mallorys
will
have
to
go
or
everybody
else
will
they
got
into
his
box
of
fishing
tackle
and
you
never
saw
such
a
mess
as
they
made
he
is
furious
with
her
mind
intent
on
her
own
troubles
mary
did
not
listen
to
the
recital
of
other
people
with
her
usual
interest
although
what
she
heard
that
night
was
recalled
very
clearly
afterward
all
evening
she
brooded
over
her
grievance
trying
to
discover
some
remedy
she
could
not
take
the
sewing
away
from
her
mother
and
do
it
herself
for
while
fairly
skilful
with
her
needle
she
had
not
learned
to
make
a
fine
art
of
her
handiwork
the
garments
ware
made
were
as
beautifully
wrought
as
those
fashioned
and
embroidered
by
the
french
nuns
i
barnaby
never
would
order
anything
so
fine
and
expensive
thought
mary
bitterly
if
she
did
know
that
we
need
the
money
so
badly
she
did
it
because
mamma
asked
her
and
felt
that
she
could
refuse
that
is
a
sort
of
charity
that
kills
me
to
accept
and
i
do
it
one
minute
longer
than
i
have
to
it
was
easier
to
make
such
a
resolution
however
than
to
carry
it
out
a
short
call
on
metz
next
morning
showed
her
that
her
first
plan
was
not
feasible
the
old
woman
being
related
to
nearly
half
of
bauer
by
birth
or
marriage
and
knowing
the
other
half
with
the
intimacy
of
an
oldest
inhabitant
was
in
a
position
to
know
each
merchant
needs
and
requirements
also
what
wages
he
paid
each
employee
most
of
them
had
no
occasion
to
hire
outside
help
their
own
families
furnished
enough
it
was
a
necessary
requirement
of
course
that
any
one
applying
for
a
position
must
speak
german
that
one
thing
alone
barred
mary
out
and
she
went
home
anxious
and
disheartened
still
even
if
she
could
have
spoken
a
dozen
tongues
the
position
she
had
coveted
did
not
seem
so
desirable
after
she
learned
the
small
amount
the
clerks
received
all
that
day
and
the
next
she
worried
over
the
matter
and
finally
decided
to
go
to
rochester
and
ask
her
advice
on
the
way
up
to
the
rectory
she
stopped
at
the
the
mail
was
being
distributed
and
while
she
stood
waiting
for
the
delivery
window
to
open
the
rector
himself
came
in
as
he
turned
away
from
his
locked
box
in
which
only
papers
had
been
deposited
so
far
he
saw
mary
and
went
over
to
her
with
a
cordial
greeting
i
looking
for
something
he
said
with
a
twinkle
of
fun
in
his
eyes
maybe
you
can
help
me
it
is
as
hard
to
find
as
the
proverbial
needle
in
the
haystack
but
i
must
have
it
before
sundown
if
possible
some
one
as
patient
as
job
as
tactful
as
a
diplomat
with
the
nerve
of
a
and
the
resources
of
a
performer
the
kind
who
can
draw
rabbits
out
of
a
silk
hat
if
necessary
mary
laughed
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
such
a
wonderful
creature
when
you
find
it
turn
it
loose
on
those
mallory
children
answered
rochester
lowering
his
tone
i
was
sent
for
yesterday
presumably
to
see
their
mother
who
is
an
invalid
but
i
found
that
the
real
reason
was
to
give
some
advice
to
mallory
about
the
children
the
hotel
refused
to
harbor
them
any
longer
and
he
had
been
summoned
hastily
by
telegraph
he
has
moved
his
family
to
a
furnished
cottage
near
the
hotel
their
meals
will
be
sent
in
to
them
and
his
mother
can
look
after
his
wife
but
he
is
desperate
about
the
children
he
acknowledges
he
could
not
cope
with
them
even
if
he
could
stay
here
all
the
time
away
from
his
business
his
wife
has
never
allowed
them
to
be
punished
and
has
foolishly
humored
them
till
they
are
past
being
controlled
he
besought
me
to
find
some
one
who
could
take
them
in
hand
for
a
part
of
the
day
at
least
but
what
could
an
outsider
do
with
them
if
their
own
family
has
failed
queried
mary
ah
that
where
the
and
the
performer
combination
gets
in
his
work
he
must
quell
them
with
his
eye
and
draw
ways
and
means
out
of
his
silk
hat
mallory
would
like
to
have
them
taught
to
read
and
write
if
it
can
be
done
without
crossing
the
little
dears
but
i
inferred
that
their
father
would
be
glad
simply
to
have
them
taken
in
hand
and
tamed
sufficiently
to
keep
them
from
being
public
nuisances
mary
pulses
began
to
pound
with
the
excitement
of
a
daring
thought
but
she
managed
to
appear
unconcerned
and
asked
him
in
a
joking
way
and
if
you
ca
find
this
diplomatic
they
want
they
have
to
take
some
ordinary
person
they
be
obliged
to
but
i
afraid
that
a
quest
even
in
that
direction
will
prove
fruitless
it
a
field
for
real
missionary
effort
though
some
one
might
be
willing
to
approach
it
in
that
spirit
the
delivery
window
flew
up
and
as
the
waiting
line
began
moving
along
towards
it
rochester
lifted
his
hat
and
turned
away
but
before
he
could
fit
his
key
in
the
lock
of
his
box
mary
was
at
his
side
one
moment
please
she
exclaimed
her
face
flushing
she
spoke
very
fast
if
you
think
that
can
fill
that
position
will
you
tell
them
about
me
i
really
got
lots
of
patience
with
children
and
laughing
nervously
last
summer
i
partly
tamed
a
young
i
could
at
least
tell
the
children
stories
and
teach
them
all
sorts
of
that
would
keep
them
busy
and
interested
out
of
doors
besides
she
flushed
still
deeper
i
find
some
way
to
earn
some
money
soon
my
very
need
of
it
would
make
me
try
all
the
harder
to
fill
the
place
i
am
on
my
way
now
to
see
rochester
and
ask
her
advice
about
what
to
do
a
few
minutes
later
she
and
rochester
were
walking
rapidly
along
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
williams
house
as
they
crossed
the
wide
which
spans
the
creek
and
climbed
the
hill
on
the
other
side
she
told
him
of
the
work
she
had
done
the
previous
summer
under
the
noted
naturalist
professor
carnes
he
had
arranged
to
send
his
niece
to
lone
rock
this
winter
she
added
but
her
physicians
decided
at
the
last
moment
that
she
needed
a
milder
climate
she
was
to
have
boarded
near
us
and
i
had
promised
to
devote
my
mornings
to
keeping
her
out
of
doors
and
teaching
her
in
an
indirect
way
that
would
not
suggest
books
or
study
hours
maybe
the
fact
that
such
a
man
as
professor
carnes
thought
me
competent
to
do
that
and
was
willing
to
pay
me
a
grown
teacher
salary
might
have
some
weight
with
the
mallorys
oh
i
they
wo
think
seventeen
and
a
half
is
too
young
she
exclaimed
with
an
anxious
glance
at
her
companion
as
if
to
discover
his
opinion
if
i
only
known
such
an
important
interview
was
ahead
of
me
i
have
worn
my
blue
suit
i
look
lots
older
in
that
because
it
longer
than
this
one
i
do
think
you
need
worry
about
that
the
rector
answered
he
spoke
gravely
but
the
face
he
turned
away
from
her
twitched
with
suppressed
amusement
they
passed
the
williams
house
and
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
a
gray
cottage
where
mallory
himself
met
them
at
the
door
he
was
a
prosperous
young
broker
with
an
affable
manner
and
the
air
that
some
people
acquire
from
the
carrying
of
a
fat
he
ushered
them
into
the
room
where
mallory
was
lying
on
a
couch
she
was
very
young
and
and
curled
up
among
the
cushions
under
a
blue
and
white
afghan
she
made
mary
think
of
a
kitten
she
seemed
so
helpless
and
incapable
as
if
she
had
never
known
anything
but
cushions
and
cream
all
her
life
two
children
were
playing
quietly
under
a
table
in
the
corner
mary
could
not
see
what
they
were
doing
for
they
were
lying
on
their
stomachs
with
their
heads
towards
the
wall
only
their
little
legs
and
slippered
feet
protruded
from
under
the
table
and
they
were
waving
back
and
forth
in
above
their
backs
when
rochester
introduced
mary
as
the
young
lady
they
were
so
desirous
of
finding
one
pair
of
small
legs
stopped
waving
and
their
owner
backed
hastily
out
into
the
room
humping
along
on
all
fours
until
she
reached
her
mother
couch
she
sat
on
the
floor
beside
it
and
began
studying
the
visitors
with
a
quiet
intense
gaze
she
was
an
attractive
child
with
rather
a
wistful
little
face
her
hair
was
cut
short
in
buster
brown
fashion
and
she
was
remarkably
strong
and
sturdy
looking
for
a
girl
otherwise
there
was
nothing
in
her
appearance
to
justify
one
belief
that
she
had
done
all
the
things
ascribed
to
her
to
mary
surprise
mallory
discussed
the
children
as
freely
as
if
they
were
not
present
repeating
their
pranks
and
smart
sayings
as
if
they
were
too
young
to
understand
what
was
being
said
and
frankly
admitting
her
inability
to
control
them
mallory
and
i
agree
on
every
subject
but
the
proper
way
to
rear
children
and
we
almost
come
to
blows
over
that
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
till
the
dimples
in
her
cheeks
made
her
seem
more
childish
and
appealing
than
ever
i
believe
in
letting
children
do
exactly
as
they
please
as
far
as
possible
the
time
will
come
soon
enough
when
they
ca
poor
little
dears
we
have
not
imposed
our
wishes
on
them
even
in
the
matter
of
names
it
has
been
a
regret
with
me
that
my
mother
burdened
me
with
a
name
that
i
despised
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
children
should
be
allowed
to
choose
their
own
little
brother
there
has
chosen
his
father
name
herbert
but
we
slow
about
adopting
it
called
him
brud
so
long
his
sister
baby
name
for
him
when
she
was
learning
to
talk
that
it
is
hard
to
break
the
habit
and
the
little
girl
asked
mary
politely
beginning
to
feel
that
she
had
hastened
to
shoulder
a
load
which
she
might
not
be
able
to
carry
really
it
too
cunning
the
way
little
sister
does
exclaimed
mallory
one
week
she
announces
she
genevive
and
the
next
that
bessie
or
maud
or
irma
whatever
happens
to
strike
her
fancy
and
she
gets
simply
furious
if
we
do
remember
every
time
she
changes
that
was
one
thing
that
miss
edna
fell
out
with
us
about
she
kept
calling
her
bessie
the
week
that
she
wished
to
be
known
as
marion
of
course
the
child
naturally
resented
it
and
miss
edna
actually
caught
her
and
shook
her
when
she
had
done
a
thing
but
throw
a
biscuit
or
some
little
article
like
that
in
her
direction
mary
cast
a
glance
at
rochester
aghast
at
the
prospect
before
her
the
soft
voice
went
on
do
believe
in
being
harsh
with
children
we
beautiful
she
reached
down
to
stroke
the
little
head
nestled
against
her
couch
i
want
my
children
to
have
it
to
remember
of
their
mother
that
she
never
scolded
or
punished
them
can
say
that
you
pet
pet
only
nodded
in
reply
but
she
caught
the
slim
white
hand
in
both
her
own
and
pressed
it
lovingly
against
her
cheek
it
made
a
pretty
tableau
and
mary
found
it
hard
to
realize
that
this
affectionate
little
creature
was
one
of
the
kleinen
teufel
of
norman
report
but
she
noticed
the
satisfied
gleam
in
the
child
eyes
when
her
mother
went
on
to
retail
other
instances
of
miss
edna
harshness
rochester
saw
the
expression
also
and
the
shrewd
knowing
glance
that
followed
when
he
finally
broached
the
terms
of
a
settlement
asking
them
to
specify
exactly
what
would
be
expected
of
mary
and
what
salary
would
be
paid
in
return
he
mildly
suggested
that
it
might
be
wiser
to
dispense
with
a
juvenile
audience
at
this
point
he
had
chosen
words
that
he
thought
far
beyond
little
comprehension
and
there
was
something
startling
as
well
as
uncanny
in
the
way
she
spoke
up
for
the
first
time
since
his
entrance
are
to
leave
this
room
nobody
can
make
me
mallory
looked
up
at
her
husband
with
an
amused
simper
and
shook
her
head
as
if
to
say
now
is
that
the
smartest
thing
you
saw
and
rochester
suggestion
was
ignored
when
they
rose
to
go
it
had
been
arranged
that
mary
was
to
take
the
children
in
charge
every
afternoon
except
sundays
from
one
till
five
at
the
same
salary
professor
carnes
had
offered
her
she
was
to
teach
them
anything
she
could
in
any
way
she
chose
provided
her
methods
did
not
conflict
with
their
happiness
the
chief
thing
was
that
they
should
be
kept
interested
and
amused
then
at
one
said
mallory
rising
with
them
they
will
take
their
first
lesson
come
out
from
under
that
table
brud
and
get
acquainted
with
your
new
teacher
brud
waved
one
leg
in
token
that
he
heard
but
made
no
further
response
suddenly
sister
found
her
voice
again
you
going
to
teach
us
first
if
we
do
like
it
we
taken
thus
suddenly
without
having
had
a
moment
in
which
to
form
any
plan
of
action
mary
groped
wildly
around
in
her
mind
for
an
answer
she
recognized
this
as
a
crucial
moment
she
could
not
hesitate
long
for
mallory
appealing
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
also
the
while
she
patted
the
child
cheek
and
purred
why
of
little
sister
will
go
when
the
nice
lady
is
planning
to
give
her
such
a
happy
time
happy
time
adoing
was
the
persistent
question
just
then
meliss
the
colored
opened
the
side
door
and
there
floated
in
from
the
hotel
kitchen
the
appetizing
smell
of
pies
hot
mince
pies
just
being
lifted
from
the
oven
mary
caught
eagerly
at
the
straw
of
suggestion
which
the
odor
offered
at
the
same
time
some
instinct
prompted
her
that
it
was
foolishness
to
address
this
child
of
eight
as
if
she
were
an
infant
or
to
talk
down
to
her
as
her
family
made
a
practise
of
doing
so
speaking
directly
to
her
as
if
she
were
addressing
an
intelligent
and
reasonable
being
she
said
gravely
the
kind
of
school
we
are
going
to
have
is
so
different
from
any
ever
heard
of
that
i
ca
explain
it
beforehand
i
can
only
tell
you
this
it
is
somewhat
like
a
jack
horner
pie
each
day
you
put
in
your
thumb
and
pull
out
a
plum
but
what
that
particular
plum
will
be
depends
on
so
many
things
that
i
could
not
possibly
give
it
a
name
before
it
actually
happens
it
will
be
a
surprise
school
at
the
mention
of
pies
the
legs
under
the
table
hastily
came
down
out
of
the
air
and
the
small
boy
attached
hastily
backed
out
into
general
view
planting
himself
in
front
of
mary
with
a
swaggering
air
his
feet
wide
apart
he
announced
aggressively
i
bring
my
new
hatchet
if
i
want
to
and
nobody
can
make
me
leave
it
at
home
there
was
something
so
impertinent
in
his
manner
that
mary
longed
to
shake
him
and
say
do
be
so
sure
of
that
mr
smarty
but
remembering
the
dignified
position
she
now
had
to
maintain
she
only
remarked
in
a
matter
of
fact
tone
if
your
hatchet
has
a
good
sharp
edge
it
will
probably
be
one
of
the
first
things
you
need
and
you
find
use
for
a
pocket
full
of
medium
sized
nails
too
what
for
he
demanded
drawing
a
little
closer
to
begin
a
thorough
cross
examination
but
mary
who
had
turned
to
listen
to
a
question
of
mallory
paid
no
heed
i
say
brud
repeated
calling
as
if
she
were
deaf
what
for
for
what
for
mary
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
until
she
had
answered
his
father
then
said
deliberately
i
already
explained
that
in
a
surprise
school
you
ca
know
what
is
going
to
happen
till
the
time
comes
why
he
whined
because
she
said
pausing
impressively
and
then
lowering
her
voice
as
if
she
were
imparting
a
mysterious
secret
the
law
of
the
the
unexpectedness
of
this
mystifying
answer
and
the
sepulchral
voice
in
which
she
gave
it
was
so
different
from
anything
brud
had
ever
encountered
before
that
it
took
him
some
seconds
to
recover
and
she
was
gone
before
he
could
think
of
another
question
mallory
walked
to
the
gate
with
them
you
certainly
started
out
well
miss
ware
he
remarked
admiringly
at
first
i
thought
we
might
have
some
difficulty
in
getting
their
consent
to
go
but
they
be
on
hand
all
right
you
aroused
their
curiosity
to
such
a
pitch
that
a
regiment
armed
to
the
teeth
could
keep
them
from
satisfying
it
now
after
an
instant
pause
he
added
a
trifle
awkwardly
seeming
to
feel
some
explanation
was
due
their
mother
never
sees
a
fault
in
them
and
my
business
keeps
me
away
from
them
so
much
that
well
you
see
yourself
how
it
is
on
the
way
home
neither
mary
nor
rochester
spoke
till
they
were
halfway
down
the
hill
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
i
hope
i
have
got
you
into
deep
water
miss
mary
he
said
it
a
big
undertaking
i
must
confess
to
a
curiosity
as
great
as
brud
what
you
going
to
do
with
them
oh
i
do
know
exclaimed
mary
desperately
did
you
see
me
fencing
for
time
when
little
sister
demanded
to
be
told
what
i
teach
them
first
things
had
happened
so
fast
that
i
had
had
a
moment
to
think
so
i
had
to
say
the
first
thing
that
came
into
my
head
i
tremble
to
think
what
a
long
pause
there
might
have
been
if
the
smell
of
those
pies
had
not
suggested
an
answer
i
think
the
first
week
i
just
play
with
them
as
hard
as
i
can
play
indian
maybe
so
that
if
they
get
too
obstreperous
it
will
be
part
of
the
game
to
tie
them
to
a
tree
and
torture
them
but
after
all
i
ca
help
being
sorry
for
the
little
things
after
hearing
their
mother
talk
to
them
and
about
them
at
the
end
of
the
where
she
turned
to
take
the
lower
road
which
was
the
short
cut
home
she
started
to
thank
him
but
he
stopped
her
earnest
words
with
an
uplifted
hand
and
an
amused
protest
wait
and
see
how
it
turns
out
before
you
thank
me
you
may
want
to
wreak
dire
vengeance
on
me
before
the
week
over
for
getting
you
into
such
a
predicament
with
a
cordial
word
of
parting
mary
hurried
down
the
road
and
burst
into
the
house
with
the
breathless
announcement
that
she
consented
to
go
as
a
missionary
that
rochester
had
persuaded
her
to
take
the
step
she
waited
a
moment
to
give
them
a
chance
to
guess
what
special
field
it
was
she
was
about
to
enter
but
was
so
eager
to
tell
that
she
had
to
burst
out
with
the
answer
herself
it
to
the
heathen
at
home
i
am
going
i
to
be
an
apostle
to
kleinen
teufel
jack
gave
a
loud
whistle
of
surprise
and
then
burst
out
laughing
but
ware
looked
across
at
him
soberly
with
a
triumphant
nod
of
the
head
there
what
did
i
tell
you
she
asked
did
i
say
that
she
soon
adjust
herself
find
something
to
amuse
herself
and
all
the
rest
of
us
as
well
mary
who
had
been
wondering
all
the
way
home
how
her
news
would
be
received
had
never
imagined
this
that
her
venture
would
be
looked
upon
merely
as
an
outlet
for
her
surplus
energy
but
after
one
gasp
of
surprise
she
was
glad
that
her
mother
had
put
it
that
way
she
did
it
on
purpose
mary
thought
so
that
jack
need
not
have
added
to
his
other
ills
the
tormenting
thought
that
he
had
driven
his
little
sister
to
a
disagreeable
task
in
order
that
she
might
help
support
him
an
understanding
glance
from
her
mother
full
of
approval
and
tender
appreciation
flashed
on
her
as
she
drew
her
chair
up
to
the
stove
but
all
she
said
was
i
sure
you
had
an
amusing
interview
then
mary
proceeded
to
recount
it
giving
a
graphic
and
laughable
description
of
her
half
hour
in
the
gray
cottage
but
all
the
time
she
was
talking
and
mimicking
she
was
looking
forward
to
the
moment
when
she
could
escape
to
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
and
calculate
with
pencil
and
paper
what
she
could
never
do
in
her
head
the
height
of
prosperity
to
which
this
tidal
wave
of
a
salary
would
lift
them
chapter
ix
at
the
barnaby
ranch
illustration
mary
ware
in
texas
three
alert
and
expectant
little
figures
sat
in
a
row
on
the
steps
three
alert
and
expectant
little
figures
sat
in
a
row
on
the
steps
of
the
gray
cottage
and
watched
for
mary
coming
the
next
afternoon
brud
sawing
his
hatchet
blade
up
and
down
on
the
edge
of
the
step
below
him
made
deep
notches
in
the
paint
while
he
waited
little
sister
fuming
with
impatience
sat
with
one
arm
around
the
young
hunting
dog
which
squatted
beside
her
and
made
dire
threats
as
to
her
conduct
in
case
the
new
teacher
should
refuse
to
let
him
go
with
them
he
was
a
brown
english
pointer
with
a
white
vest
and
the
silver
plate
on
his
collar
bore
the
name
by
which
he
was
registered
among
the
aristocracy
of
dogs
the
name
was
uncle
august
strangers
always
laughed
when
they
read
that
on
his
collar
but
as
brud
usually
began
to
explain
about
that
time
that
he
was
a
peggydreed
dog
his
sister
thought
that
they
were
laughing
at
the
way
he
pronounced
pedigreed
therefore
she
would
gravely
correct
him
and
add
the
information
that
one
of
his
great
was
the
king
of
kent
and
another
was
that
he
was
the
finest
in
the
united
states
her
pappy
said
so
and
that
he
had
been
to
a
dog
college
and
learned
all
that
there
was
for
a
dog
know
the
moment
mary
appeared
the
usual
formula
was
gone
through
with
before
they
gave
her
a
chance
for
more
than
a
bare
word
of
greeting
and
she
never
knew
how
much
her
reception
of
uncle
august
counted
in
her
favor
with
the
two
watching
children
like
everybody
else
she
laughed
when
she
heard
his
name
and
put
out
her
hand
to
shake
the
brown
paw
which
he
gravely
offered
but
when
he
continued
to
hold
it
out
to
her
and
plainly
showed
by
every
way
in
a
dog
power
that
he
liked
her
and
wanted
to
emphasize
his
friendliness
she
took
his
silky
ears
in
her
hands
and
looking
down
into
his
wistful
eyes
praised
and
petted
him
till
he
wriggled
all
over
for
joy
brud
immediately
gave
her
his
full
approval
but
little
sister
while
impressed
favorably
was
not
in
a
mood
to
approve
anything
fully
according
to
meliss
she
done
got
out
of
bed
crosswise
of
herself
that
mawnin
and
had
continued
so
ever
since
there
was
a
pout
on
her
lips
when
her
mother
called
her
in
to
kiss
her
and
there
was
a
defiant
light
in
her
eyes
as
she
listened
to
the
farewell
instructions
delivered
to
mary
through
the
window
she
lagged
behind
when
the
others
started
briskly
off
and
halfway
down
the
hill
began
to
drag
and
scrape
her
feet
annoyingly
through
the
gravel
although
she
had
the
faintest
intention
of
turning
back
she
stood
still
when
they
reached
the
and
announced
with
a
whine
i
going
home
i
are
a
having
a
happy
time
like
mommey
said
i
would
mary
who
was
a
few
steps
ahead
never
stopped
even
to
glance
back
over
her
shoulder
and
sister
was
obliged
to
follow
in
order
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
you
can
hardly
expect
to
enjoy
a
thing
before
it
explained
mary
politely
in
that
tone
that
was
such
a
novelty
to
sister
when
employed
towards
herself
you
never
seen
the
place
where
metz
has
given
us
permission
to
build
it
where
a
branch
of
the
creek
curves
up
through
his
place
it
dry
now
but
it
is
full
of
big
flat
rocks
where
we
can
build
the
fire
when
we
get
to
that
part
of
the
school
maybe
we
be
ready
for
one
as
soon
as
next
week
there
was
no
response
save
a
stifled
sniffle
and
the
patter
of
small
feet
which
had
to
move
briskly
in
order
to
keep
up
with
the
procession
but
brud
questions
opened
the
way
for
further
information
which
was
not
lost
on
the
reluctant
follower
there
a
little
spring
that
comes
bubbling
out
below
so
that
we
have
to
go
far
to
fill
our
kettle
he
said
we
might
trim
off
some
of
the
smallest
shoots
of
his
willows
and
he
marked
the
trees
we
could
chop
that
where
you
will
find
use
for
your
hatchet
willow
switches
woven
together
make
a
fine
covering
for
a
wigwam
or
a
robinson
crusoe
shack
i
learned
how
to
weave
them
the
way
the
indians
do
when
i
first
went
to
arizona
it
was
the
novelty
of
being
talked
to
in
that
dignified
way
that
drew
sister
slowly
but
surely
along
after
the
others
as
they
followed
the
creek
uncle
august
dashing
on
ahead
scared
a
rabbit
out
of
the
underbrush
he
was
too
well
trained
to
give
chase
to
it
so
the
frightened
little
loped
away
unhurt
it
served
its
mission
in
life
however
as
far
as
mary
was
concerned
for
it
reminded
her
of
a
story
which
she
proceeded
to
tell
as
they
walked
along
sister
listened
suspiciously
expecting
a
personal
application
at
the
end
about
a
sulky
little
girl
who
never
wanted
to
do
anything
that
other
people
did
that
was
the
kind
meliss
always
told
so
did
mommey
in
vivacious
kindergarten
style
when
they
had
been
especially
naughty
sister
hated
stories
since
those
with
a
moral
attached
were
the
only
kind
she
had
ever
known
when
this
tale
turned
out
to
be
one
of
rabbit
funny
adventures
in
outwitting
fox
and
ended
with
a
laugh
instead
of
a
personal
application
she
was
bewildered
for
a
moment
then
she
remembered
that
this
was
a
surprise
school
and
determined
not
to
miss
anything
that
seemed
to
start
out
with
such
promise
for
further
entertainment
she
stopped
dragging
her
feet
and
took
up
a
more
cheerful
pace
along
the
creek
bank
in
the
trail
of
brud
and
uncle
august
it
would
have
been
a
determined
soul
indeed
who
could
have
stayed
morose
very
long
in
the
perfect
weather
that
had
followed
the
norther
it
was
like
late
october
in
kentucky
sunny
yet
with
a
coolness
that
made
exercise
a
delight
it
had
been
such
a
short
time
since
mary
had
stepped
out
of
her
own
play
days
that
she
found
herself
stepping
into
the
children
with
an
which
almost
equalled
theirs
there
was
no
pretense
about
her
enjoyment
at
first
with
a
pleasure
almost
as
deep
and
unalloyed
as
when
she
and
hazel
lee
built
wigwams
on
the
edge
of
the
arizona
desert
she
went
about
the
building
of
a
shack
on
the
side
of
this
texas
creek
bank
the
energy
with
which
she
brought
things
to
pass
was
contagious
brud
and
little
sister
worked
like
beavers
to
keep
up
with
this
rare
new
playfellow
who
had
something
better
than
a
midas
touch
something
which
not
only
put
a
golden
glamour
over
everything
she
said
and
did
but
turned
their
little
world
of
mimic
sports
into
a
real
world
of
tremendous
meaning
and
importance
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
brud
found
himself
where
there
were
things
lawful
for
his
hatchet
to
cut
for
the
first
time
sister
was
kept
so
busy
doing
delightful
things
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
anyone
to
say
do
before
the
week
was
over
mary
had
opened
so
many
windows
for
them
into
the
land
of
that
they
began
to
look
upon
her
resources
for
entertainment
as
boundless
the
more
she
gave
the
more
they
demanded
they
never
wanted
to
go
home
and
would
have
hung
on
to
her
until
dark
every
evening
had
it
not
been
for
the
which
she
brought
with
her
each
day
she
had
no
watch
and
was
afraid
to
accept
offer
of
his
lest
she
should
lose
it
in
the
woods
it
was
a
little
round
clock
with
a
bell
on
top
the
dollar
and
a
half
kind
sold
in
country
groceries
and
stores
she
always
wound
the
alarm
just
before
she
hung
the
clock
on
a
bush
muttering
over
it
a
mysterious
charm
that
the
children
listened
to
with
skeptical
grins
yet
with
furtive
at
each
other
to
her
surprise
they
accepted
the
whirr
and
bang
of
the
at
five
as
the
voice
of
fate
which
must
be
promptly
obeyed
she
often
wondered
why
they
did
to
mary
the
muttering
of
the
abracadabra
charm
was
only
a
part
of
the
game
one
of
the
many
little
embellishments
which
made
her
plays
more
picturesque
than
ordinary
people
and
she
had
no
thought
of
the
children
attaching
any
superstitious
import
to
it
she
did
not
take
into
account
their
long
association
with
meliss
who
was
wise
on
the
subject
of
hoodoos
but
the
fact
remained
that
her
was
the
only
timepiece
within
their
reach
which
they
never
tampered
with
and
the
only
one
whose
summons
they
ever
obeyed
it
was
probably
because
she
had
set
such
a
hard
pace
for
herself
that
first
week
that
she
found
it
so
difficult
to
go
on
afterward
a
surprise
school
was
a
greater
tax
on
her
inventive
genius
than
she
had
anticipated
she
had
promised
them
a
different
plum
in
their
pie
each
day
and
she
lay
awake
at
night
to
plan
games
that
were
instructive
as
well
as
interesting
for
she
was
conscientiously
carrying
out
her
agreement
to
teach
them
as
well
as
to
amuse
them
by
the
end
of
the
second
week
the
strain
was
almost
unendurable
one
evening
she
went
home
to
find
the
barnaby
carriage
and
the
gray
mules
standing
at
the
gate
barnaby
had
brought
in
some
venison
for
them
and
waited
to
see
mary
before
taking
her
leave
i
waiting
to
hear
about
those
little
savages
of
yours
she
said
as
mary
greeted
her
and
sank
limply
down
into
a
chair
why
you
look
all
tuckered
out
they
must
be
even
worse
than
people
say
no
they
not
protested
mary
warmly
i
really
proud
of
the
way
i
succeeded
the
only
thing
is
i
have
to
keep
them
busy
and
interested
every
moment
and
they
so
hungry
for
stories
they
never
get
enough
the
poor
little
souls
have
never
heard
any
before
and
it
is
really
pathetic
the
way
they
listen
they
sit
as
still
as
graven
images
so
interested
they
scarcely
breathe
till
the
last
word
is
out
then
they
begin
tell
us
another
miss
mayry
just
more
please
miss
mayry
they
cling
to
me
like
burrs
we
nearly
always
have
a
small
campfire
every
day
now
for
either
we
indians
or
gypsies
cooking
our
meals
or
we
witches
brewing
spells
or
elves
gathering
magic
fires
for
our
midnight
revels
they
play
so
hard
that
the
last
hour
they
always
want
to
sit
down
by
the
embers
and
listen
to
stories
but
they
nearly
drained
me
dry
now
sometimes
i
come
home
so
limp
and
exhausted
i
can
scarcely
move
my
tongue
i
glad
that
is
sunday
for
i
surely
earned
one
day
of
rest
come
out
and
spend
it
at
the
ranch
urged
barnaby
hospitably
it
happens
that
there
is
no
service
at
boniface
but
james
will
be
coming
in
for
the
mail
and
will
be
glad
to
bring
you
out
in
time
for
dinner
mary
had
spent
two
afternoons
at
the
barnaby
ranch
driving
out
with
rochester
and
she
enjoyed
them
so
much
that
she
welcomed
the
thought
of
a
return
to
the
homelike
old
place
with
its
air
of
thrift
and
comfort
jack
had
been
better
the
last
few
days
so
she
eagerly
accepted
the
invitation
next
morning
barnaby
drove
in
for
her
himself
with
the
gray
mules
and
the
roomy
old
carriage
mary
comfortably
stowed
away
on
the
back
seat
because
it
had
the
best
springs
leaned
forward
to
hold
the
reins
while
he
went
into
the
she
had
risen
early
and
hurried
through
as
much
of
the
work
as
she
could
in
order
that
her
holiday
might
not
mean
extra
work
for
her
mother
now
with
an
easy
conscience
she
settled
herself
to
enjoy
a
day
and
looked
forward
with
keen
enjoyment
to
the
seven
miles
drive
along
the
smooth
country
road
she
had
been
sitting
in
a
pleasant
reverie
some
four
or
five
minutes
when
a
familiar
little
voice
close
by
the
wheel
piped
out
why
there
miss
mayry
are
you
going
before
she
could
reply
brud
and
sister
and
uncle
august
came
swarming
into
the
carriage
stepping
on
her
toes
climbing
up
on
the
seat
and
showing
such
joy
over
having
discovered
her
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
give
them
a
gracious
reception
even
though
she
groaned
inwardly
at
the
sight
of
them
their
prompt
demand
for
a
story
the
moment
they
were
seated
was
followed
by
the
appearance
of
barnaby
i
ca
tell
you
any
stories
mary
explained
pleasantly
because
i
am
going
visiting
but
i
tell
you
a
lovely
one
about
ali
baba
and
the
forty
thieves
you
have
to
hop
out
now
barnaby
is
ready
to
start
i
are
going
to
hop
out
declared
sister
winding
her
arms
around
mary
neck
in
a
choking
clasp
brud
immediately
threw
his
arms
around
uncle
august
and
held
him
tight
regardless
of
the
fact
that
barnaby
was
whistling
to
the
dog
and
motioning
him
to
jump
out
we
are
with
you
brud
announced
but
you
are
not
invited
mary
answered
in
a
provoked
tone
you
surely
do
care
to
go
where
you
neither
asked
nor
wanted
come
on
bub
i
in
a
hurry
said
barnaby
kindly
he
took
hold
of
the
child
arms
to
lift
him
out
but
brud
seizing
the
back
of
the
seat
with
both
hands
stiffened
himself
and
began
to
cry
shrieking
out
between
sobs
i
want
to
go
with
miss
mayry
do
put
me
out
aw
miss
mayry
let
him
put
me
out
immediately
sister
added
her
tearful
wails
to
his
meliss
sauntering
down
the
street
in
search
of
the
children
heard
the
familiar
cries
and
quickened
her
pace
to
a
run
a
crowd
was
gathering
around
the
carriage
she
came
up
in
time
to
hear
barnaby
say
oh
well
if
they
going
to
break
their
little
hearts
over
it
let
come
along
do
mind
but
their
mother
will
think
that
something
has
happened
to
them
protested
mary
she
be
frantic
meliss
pushed
her
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
carriage
no
she
wo
miss
she
wo
worry
none
her
haid
aches
fit
to
bus
this
mawnin
i
tell
her
takin
keer
of
and
she
be
only
too
thankful
to
for
a
free
day
it
meliss
who
will
be
thankful
for
a
free
day
thought
mary
still
hesitating
she
rebelled
at
the
thought
of
her
own
day
being
spoiled
and
realized
that
for
discipline
sake
the
children
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
carry
their
point
barnaby
settled
the
question
by
stepping
into
the
carriage
and
gathering
up
the
reins
tell
their
mother
i
bring
them
back
before
night
he
said
to
meliss
the
sobs
and
tears
stopped
as
suddenly
as
they
had
begun
presently
barnaby
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
saying
this
load
does
seem
equally
divided
here
one
of
you
kids
climb
over
into
the
front
seat
with
me
at
the
invitation
both
children
threw
themselves
violently
on
mary
and
clung
to
her
beginning
to
sniffle
again
he
looked
back
at
her
with
the
humorous
smile
that
she
always
found
irresistibly
droll
first
time
i
ever
came
across
that
particular
brand
of
youngsters
strikes
me
the
old
nick
has
put
his
ear
marks
on
pretty
plain
you
crowded
back
there
are
you
with
that
dog
sitting
on
your
feet
here
sir
come
over
here
with
me
with
one
bound
uncle
august
sprang
over
on
the
front
seat
and
sat
up
beside
his
host
looking
so
dignified
and
so
humanly
interested
in
everything
they
passed
that
barnaby
laughed
he
laid
a
caressing
hand
on
him
saying
so
you
the
dog
that
been
to
college
well
it
has
made
a
gentleman
of
you
sir
i
admire
your
manners
it
a
pity
you
ca
pass
them
around
the
family
charmed
by
the
novelty
of
the
drive
the
children
cuddled
up
against
mary
and
were
so
quiet
all
the
way
to
the
ranch
that
she
felt
remorseful
when
she
remembered
how
near
she
had
come
to
depriving
them
of
the
pleasure
barnaby
threw
up
her
hands
in
surprise
when
she
saw
the
three
guests
who
calmly
followed
mary
out
of
the
carriage
but
when
the
situation
had
been
explained
in
a
laughing
aside
she
said
in
her
motherly
way
now
my
dear
do
you
worry
one
mite
we
are
used
to
children
and
we
find
some
way
to
keep
them
from
spoiling
your
day
her
first
step
in
that
direction
was
to
take
them
out
to
the
kitchen
and
fill
their
hands
with
cookies
and
send
them
outdoors
to
eat
them
she
also
gave
them
instructions
to
stay
out
and
play
a
low
swing
and
a
seesaw
between
the
kitchen
and
the
garden
gate
showed
where
her
amused
themselves
hours
at
a
time
on
their
annual
visits
when
she
went
back
into
the
mary
had
seated
herself
in
a
with
a
sigh
of
content
what
a
dear
old
room
this
is
she
said
looking
up
with
a
smile
it
makes
me
think
of
grandmother
ware
i
love
its
low
ceiling
and
little
windows
and
wide
fireplace
i
could
sit
here
all
day
and
do
nothing
but
listen
to
the
clock
tick
and
the
fire
crackle
and
rest
well
you
do
just
that
insisted
barnaby
hospitably
i
have
to
be
out
in
the
kitchen
for
a
while
i
got
pretty
fair
help
but
she
needs
a
good
deal
of
oversight
so
you
sit
here
and
enjoy
the
quiet
while
you
can
the
early
rising
and
the
drive
had
made
mary
drowsy
and
as
soon
as
she
was
left
alone
the
deep
stillness
of
the
country
sabbath
that
filled
the
room
seemed
to
fold
about
her
like
a
mantle
of
restfulness
she
closed
her
eyes
making
believe
that
she
really
was
back
at
her
grandmother
ware
that
the
sunshine
streaming
in
at
the
open
door
was
the
sunshine
of
a
northern
june
instead
of
a
texas
january
and
that
the
odor
of
lemon
verbena
which
reached
her
now
and
then
came
from
an
outside
garden
instead
of
the
potted
plant
on
the
deep
at
her
elbow
the
old
place
was
so
associated
in
mary
memory
with
a
feeling
of
perpetual
unbroken
calm
that
she
had
never
lost
one
of
her
earliest
impressions
that
it
was
the
place
of
green
pastures
and
still
waters
mentioned
in
the
psalms
jack
always
said
that
i
have
my
innings
when
i
a
grandmother
she
said
drowsily
to
herself
i
wonder
if
i
ever
get
to
a
place
where
i
can
always
be
as
serene
of
spirit
as
she
was
no
matter
what
happens
i
wonder
if
she
ever
had
anything
as
upsetting
as
brud
and
sister
to
try
her
nerves
in
her
young
days
as
if
in
answer
to
her
mere
thought
of
them
the
two
children
came
racing
around
the
house
they
fairly
fell
into
the
room
and
throwing
themselves
across
her
lap
demanded
that
she
come
out
at
once
and
see
the
peacocks
had
they
said
any
other
kind
of
fowl
she
would
have
resented
the
intrusion
more
than
she
did
but
peacocks
recalled
warwick
hall
so
pleasantly
that
she
got
up
at
once
and
went
with
them
she
had
seen
none
since
leaving
school
these
had
not
been
near
the
house
on
her
former
visits
to
the
ranch
the
stately
birds
strutted
up
and
down
in
the
sunshine
their
tails
spread
in
dazzling
gorgeousness
they
sammy
called
barnaby
from
the
kitchen
door
he
takes
the
greatest
pride
in
them
that
cock
took
a
prize
at
the
last
san
antonio
fair
mary
had
met
sammy
the
last
time
she
was
at
the
ranch
and
had
heard
of
him
ever
since
her
first
conversation
with
barnaby
he
was
an
elderly
cousin
of
her
husband
who
had
made
his
home
with
them
for
years
a
few
minutes
later
she
came
upon
the
old
man
in
the
barnyard
the
children
having
once
obtained
possession
of
her
had
dragged
her
down
there
to
see
a
colt
that
they
had
discovered
sammy
was
sitting
on
the
fence
in
his
sunday
clothes
busy
with
his
usual
sunday
occupation
of
whittling
his
bushy
gray
beard
made
him
look
older
than
barnaby
and
the
keen
glance
he
gave
the
children
from
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
made
them
sidle
away
from
him
they
too
had
met
him
before
under
circumstances
which
they
did
not
take
pleasure
in
recalling
only
a
few
moments
before
he
had
caught
them
chasing
the
ducks
until
they
were
dizzy
and
stopped
them
with
a
sternness
that
made
them
wary
of
him
they
had
had
an
encounter
with
him
one
day
in
town
also
soon
after
their
arrival
in
bauer
they
had
climbed
into
the
wagon
which
he
left
hitched
in
front
of
the
grocery
and
had
poked
holes
into
every
package
he
had
piled
on
the
seat
in
order
to
discover
what
they
held
when
he
came
out
little
streams
of
rice
and
sugar
and
meal
were
dribbling
out
all
over
the
wagon
when
he
started
after
them
with
a
threatening
crack
of
his
whip
they
escaped
by
darting
into
the
front
door
of
the
butcher
shop
and
out
of
the
back
but
they
always
felt
that
it
was
one
of
the
narrowest
escapes
they
ever
made
and
that
a
day
of
reckoning
would
come
if
he
ever
got
close
enough
to
them
to
reach
them
with
his
whip
it
was
a
trifling
disconcerting
to
come
across
him
suddenly
on
this
peaceful
ranch
and
they
pulled
mary
away
as
soon
as
they
could
she
was
enjoying
the
conversation
they
had
drifted
into
starting
with
the
colt
he
spoke
with
a
strong
new
england
twang
and
his
quaint
sayings
and
homely
comparisons
suggested
the
types
and
times
portrayed
in
the
bigelow
papers
despite
her
determination
not
to
have
her
day
taken
up
by
the
children
mary
found
herself
devoting
the
entire
morning
to
their
entertainment
country
sights
and
sounds
were
so
new
and
strange
to
them
that
it
seemed
selfish
not
to
answer
their
eager
questions
and
when
their
wanderings
around
the
place
led
them
to
a
deserted
cabin
where
the
indians
had
once
killed
two
mexican
shepherds
she
repeated
the
thrilling
story
as
she
had
heard
it
from
barnaby
with
all
its
details
when
they
went
in
to
dinner
she
had
been
answering
questions
and
entertaining
her
pupils
for
two
hours
as
diligently
as
on
any
it
was
an
turkey
dinner
to
which
they
were
summoned
and
the
variety
and
deliciousness
of
the
dishes
may
have
had
much
to
do
with
the
children
conduct
they
were
so
quiet
and
well
behaved
that
mary
watched
them
in
surprise
beyond
yes
and
no
and
politely
expressed
thanks
brud
spoke
not
at
all
and
sister
only
once
that
was
to
say
when
barnaby
addressed
her
as
sister
call
me
nancy
i
trying
that
name
now
seeing
the
look
of
surprise
that
circled
around
the
table
mary
explained
feeling
that
sister
as
usual
was
enjoying
the
limelight
that
this
peculiar
custom
of
hers
called
her
into
hump
exclaimed
old
sammy
something
of
a
chameleon
eh
if
she
changes
her
nature
to
suit
her
name
it
must
keep
her
family
busy
getting
acquainted
with
her
i
think
it
does
have
some
slight
influence
answered
mary
then
better
drop
the
name
of
nancy
said
old
sammy
with
a
solemn
wag
of
the
head
in
an
old
blue
poetry
book
that
i
used
to
read
back
in
vermont
it
said
nancy
would
never
her
mother
obey
but
always
did
choose
to
have
her
own
way
she
came
to
a
frightful
end
jumping
up
and
down
in
her
chair
vain
did
her
mother
command
her
to
stop
nan
only
laughed
louder
and
higher
did
hop
till
she
fell
over
and
cracked
her
head
the
only
nancys
i
have
ever
known
have
all
been
like
that
garrulous
cousin
sammy
was
only
indulging
in
reminiscence
he
had
not
intended
to
tease
the
child
but
she
resented
his
remarks
and
thrusting
out
her
tongue
at
him
screwed
up
her
face
into
the
ugliest
grimace
possible
for
her
to
make
fortunately
the
arrival
of
a
huge
pumpkin
pie
turned
his
eyes
away
from
her
just
then
for
sammy
bradford
old
bachelor
though
he
was
had
strict
new
england
notions
about
the
rearing
of
children
which
he
sometimes
burned
to
put
into
practice
for
the
good
of
the
general
public
after
dinner
barnaby
retired
to
his
room
for
his
usual
sunday
nap
cousin
sammy
took
his
pipe
to
the
sunny
bench
outside
the
open
door
and
barnaby
provided
for
the
children
entertainment
by
bringing
out
a
box
of
toys
that
had
been
left
behind
at
different
times
by
various
she
arranged
them
on
a
side
table
in
the
with
some
colored
pencils
paper
and
scissors
brud
and
nancy
ever
ready
to
investigate
anything
new
seated
themselves
at
her
bidding
and
began
to
paw
over
the
games
and
pictures
with
apparent
interest
thereupon
barnaby
and
mary
went
into
the
next
room
and
drawing
two
big
easy
chairs
into
the
chimney
corner
they
settled
themselves
for
a
long
cosy
it
was
the
first
opportunity
mary
had
had
to
explain
to
barnaby
that
she
had
undertaken
to
teach
the
children
in
order
to
prevent
her
mother
from
sewing
for
other
people
they
had
had
about
ten
minutes
of
uninterrupted
quiet
when
the
door
opened
and
nancy
walked
in
with
her
hat
and
coat
on
her
lips
were
drawn
into
a
dissatisfied
pout
and
she
threw
herself
across
mary
lap
whining
i
do
like
those
old
things
in
there
tell
us
about
the
forty
thieves
no
nancy
said
mary
firmly
hoping
to
appease
her
by
remembering
to
use
the
new
name
i
told
you
before
you
came
out
here
that
i
not
tell
you
a
single
story
but
you
already
have
cried
brud
triumphantly
appearing
in
the
doorway
also
in
coat
and
hat
you
told
us
about
the
indians
killing
the
shepherds
oh
but
that
was
just
a
true
happening
that
i
told
to
explain
about
the
cabin
we
were
looking
at
was
the
patient
answer
that
was
different
from
sitting
down
on
purpose
to
tell
you
a
story
and
i
shall
do
that
then
come
and
play
with
us
demanded
sister
seizing
her
by
the
hands
after
one
keen
glance
at
her
to
see
if
she
really
was
in
earnest
come
on
brud
and
help
me
pull
we
her
come
sh
warned
mary
attempting
to
free
herself
as
they
began
shouting
and
tugging
at
her
i
came
out
here
to
visit
barnaby
and
i
not
play
with
you
till
if
you
do
want
to
make
pictures
or
cut
paper
or
work
the
puzzle
games
you
have
to
go
outdoors
and
amuse
yourselves
but
you
must
not
make
such
a
noise
barnaby
is
asleep
then
if
you
do
want
us
to
wake
him
up
you
to
play
with
us
to
keep
us
still
cried
brud
has
she
sister
call
me
nancy
when
i
tell
you
screamed
sister
in
an
exasperated
tone
stamping
her
foot
then
fired
by
brud
suggestion
she
dropped
mary
hands
and
darted
across
the
room
to
the
piano
which
was
standing
open
in
the
corner
it
was
an
one
its
rosewood
case
inlaid
above
the
keyboard
with
the
yellow
keys
were
out
of
tune
but
they
had
never
been
touched
save
by
careful
fingers
for
it
was
one
of
barnaby
cherished
treasures
now
she
rose
as
if
she
had
been
struck
herself
as
both
children
began
pounding
upon
it
ruthlessly
with
their
fists
making
a
hideous
discordant
din
stop
children
stop
i
say
she
demanded
but
her
commands
fell
on
unheeding
ears
and
they
pounded
away
until
she
laid
vigorous
hands
on
them
and
forcibly
dragged
them
away
from
the
piano
instantly
they
struggled
out
of
her
grasp
and
rushing
back
pounded
the
keys
harder
than
before
mary
who
had
never
seen
them
act
like
this
was
distressed
beyond
measure
that
she
had
been
the
cause
even
though
the
unwilling
one
of
such
an
invasion
she
started
to
the
rescue
thinking
savagely
that
they
would
have
to
be
gagged
and
tied
hand
and
foot
and
that
she
would
take
pleasure
in
helping
do
it
old
sammy
reached
them
first
however
his
puritanical
soul
resenting
both
the
disobedience
and
the
uproar
with
one
swoop
he
caught
up
a
child
under
each
arm
and
carried
them
kicking
and
struggling
here
ye
stay
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
announced
in
a
gruff
voice
as
he
put
them
down
there
all
to
play
in
and
if
you
so
much
as
step
over
the
into
that
room
until
i
give
ye
leave
i
ye
it
was
a
mysterious
threat
since
neither
child
had
ever
heard
the
word
before
and
he
said
it
in
a
deep
awful
voice
that
made
brud
think
creepily
of
the
giant
in
his
at
home
who
went
about
smelling
blood
and
saying
or
alive
i
will
have
some
for
a
moment
they
stood
in
awed
silence
gaping
at
the
only
person
who
had
ever
intimidated
them
then
sister
in
a
blind
rage
seized
his
clay
pipe
that
he
had
put
down
on
the
bench
and
threw
it
with
all
her
force
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
porch
you
let
me
alone
she
shrieked
as
she
darted
away
from
him
you
you
you
old
you
it
was
the
sight
of
his
gray
beard
that
finally
suggested
to
her
choking
wrath
a
name
ugly
enough
to
hurl
at
him
then
she
took
to
her
heels
down
the
grassy
lane
brud
following
as
fast
as
possible
there
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
follow
them
said
mary
starting
into
the
bedroom
for
her
hat
and
coat
which
had
been
laid
away
in
there
i
feel
so
responsible
if
they
should
get
hurt
and
there
are
so
many
things
on
a
big
place
like
this
that
they
are
not
used
to
now
do
you
worry
interrupted
old
sammy
i
keep
eye
on
them
he
was
quite
red
in
the
face
with
vexation
over
the
loss
of
his
pipe
which
lay
in
several
pieces
on
the
floor
and
barnaby
knowing
him
well
prevailed
on
mary
to
come
back
to
her
you
leave
them
to
him
she
insisted
in
a
laughing
aside
he
so
mad
that
he
watch
them
like
a
hawk
just
for
the
pleasure
of
pouncing
down
on
them
again
if
they
cut
up
any
more
didoes
but
his
bark
is
worse
than
his
bite
and
they
be
perfectly
safe
with
him
so
mary
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
back
to
their
interrupted
conversation
but
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
an
uneasy
feeling
that
kept
obtruding
itself
into
her
thoughts
even
when
she
was
most
interested
if
brud
and
sister
had
deliberately
planned
a
revenge
on
the
old
man
who
had
forced
them
into
exile
and
temporary
obedience
they
could
not
have
chosen
anything
which
would
have
hurt
him
worse
than
their
next
prank
their
wild
chase
down
the
lane
had
been
brought
to
a
sudden
stop
by
the
sight
of
the
lordly
peacock
strutting
back
and
forth
in
the
his
beautiful
tail
spread
wide
in
the
sun
they
climbed
up
on
the
gate
to
watch
it
and
hanging
over
the
top
bar
admired
it
in
almost
breathless
ecstasy
for
several
minutes
the
iridescent
shimmer
of
the
gorgeous
eyes
in
its
tail
started
a
dispute
that
why
you
ca
ever
catch
a
peacock
brud
asserted
with
all
those
eyes
in
its
tail
it
can
see
you
coming
up
behind
it
aw
goosey
contradicted
nancy
it
sees
with
its
two
little
eyes
those
feather
eyes
in
its
tail
ca
see
they
can
they
ca
the
two
words
were
bandied
back
and
forth
the
dispute
promising
to
go
on
indefinitely
till
brud
triumphant
ten
million
times
was
answered
by
nancy
final
million
billion
times
so
there
we
prove
it
was
brud
next
taunt
try
and
see
if
you
can
catch
him
all
right
was
the
willing
assent
and
if
the
feathers
come
out
of
his
tail
as
easy
as
they
did
out
of
mis
williams
red
rooster
that
old
man
be
mad
in
the
meantime
sammy
had
gone
into
the
house
to
hunt
among
his
possessions
for
a
certain
corncob
pipe
to
take
the
place
of
the
clay
one
just
broken
the
in
his
room
was
as
crowded
as
the
corner
of
an
old
junk
shop
so
it
took
some
time
for
him
to
find
what
he
was
searching
for
he
had
taken
it
down
and
was
slowly
filling
it
when
the
sound
of
a
wild
commotion
in
the
made
him
hurry
to
the
door
turkeys
guineas
ducks
hens
everything
that
could
gobble
or
flutter
or
squawk
were
doing
their
utmost
to
attract
attention
and
the
cause
of
it
all
or
rather
the
two
causes
were
standing
by
the
comparing
the
spoils
of
the
chase
they
had
crept
up
behind
the
peacock
despite
his
thousand
eyes
and
caught
him
by
the
tail
each
proudly
clutched
a
handful
of
long
trailing
feathers
and
the
bird
miserably
conscious
that
his
glory
had
been
torn
from
him
had
taken
refuge
under
the
you
outrageous
little
hittites
roared
old
sammy
coming
upon
them
suddenly
and
seeing
the
feathers
then
a
real
chase
began
a
little
while
later
mary
paused
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
to
say
listen
did
that
sound
like
the
children
crying
or
calling
barnaby
who
was
slightly
deaf
shook
her
head
no
i
think
not
anyhow
sammy
is
looking
after
them
he
wo
let
them
come
to
any
real
harm
what
was
it
we
were
talking
about
oh
yes
those
heirloom
candlesticks
more
than
an
hour
afterward
a
shadow
darkened
the
doorway
for
an
instant
as
sammy
strode
past
it
on
his
way
across
the
porch
bradford
called
mary
do
you
know
where
the
children
are
at
her
call
he
turned
back
to
the
door
holding
out
a
great
handful
of
peacock
feathers
which
he
was
taking
sorrowfully
to
his
room
those
pesky
little
varmints
he
exclaimed
still
wrathful
teetotally
ruined
that
cock
looks
yes
i
know
where
they
are
had
them
shut
up
in
the
till
a
minute
ago
shut
up
in
the
echoed
mary
and
barnaby
in
the
same
breath
yes
as
i
told
they
have
any
more
idea
of
other
people
rights
than
weasels
and
it
high
time
they
are
being
taught
well
do
you
think
they
learned
their
lesson
in
one
dose
sammy
asked
barnaby
dryly
coming
out
from
his
room
in
time
to
hear
his
cousin
speech
that
remains
to
be
seen
spluttered
sammy
as
he
strode
on
to
his
room
they
were
sniffling
and
snubbing
considerable
when
i
let
them
out
i
do
think
they
chase
peacock
any
more
the
sniffling
and
snubbing
changed
into
crying
as
soon
as
they
reached
mary
side
and
that
was
followed
by
wails
and
demands
to
be
taken
home
nothing
comforted
them
nothing
could
turn
them
aside
from
their
belief
that
they
had
been
abused
and
must
be
taken
back
immediately
to
mommey
after
nearly
half
an
hour
spent
in
vain
attempts
to
silence
them
barnaby
said
in
sheer
desperation
well
james
you
just
have
to
hitch
up
and
take
them
back
even
if
it
is
so
early
i
hate
to
have
mary
visit
cut
short
but
they
spoil
it
worse
if
they
stayed
if
i
only
felt
free
to
give
them
a
good
sound
spanking
now
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
looked
over
her
spectacles
so
sternly
that
the
children
backed
away
lest
a
feeling
of
liberty
might
suddenly
descend
upon
her
as
mary
pinned
on
her
hat
before
the
mirror
in
the
bedroom
she
turned
to
her
hostess
with
a
hunted
look
in
her
eyes
do
you
ever
get
desperate
over
things
she
asked
that
the
way
i
am
now
i
so
tired
of
those
children
that
the
very
sound
of
their
voices
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
if
i
only
could
have
had
this
one
whole
day
away
from
them
i
might
have
been
able
to
go
on
with
them
but
now
it
seems
as
if
i
ca
i
just
i
do
wonder
you
poor
child
was
the
sympathetic
answer
the
worst
of
it
is
i
utterly
discouraged
confessed
mary
almost
tearfully
i
been
pluming
myself
on
the
fact
that
my
two
weeks
work
had
amounted
to
something
that
i
really
made
an
impression
and
given
them
all
sorts
of
good
ideas
but
you
see
it
is
worth
a
row
of
pins
they
are
good
only
so
long
as
i
exercising
like
an
acrobat
mind
and
body
to
keep
them
entertained
the
minute
i
stop
they
do
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
my
wishes
maybe
you
done
too
much
for
them
said
barnaby
shrewdly
guessing
the
root
of
the
trouble
you
told
them
it
was
a
surprise
school
let
the
next
surprise
be
a
different
sort
turn
them
loose
and
make
them
hunt
their
own
entertainment
as
they
did
mary
answered
with
a
shrug
they
run
home
howling
and
their
mother
would
think
i
was
incapable
and
give
my
place
to
someone
else
no
we
must
have
the
money
so
i
have
to
go
on
and
put
in
my
best
licks
no
matter
how
i
detest
it
when
she
drew
on
her
gloves
she
was
so
near
to
tears
that
the
little
bloodstone
ring
on
her
hand
looked
so
dim
she
could
scarcely
see
it
but
it
made
her
glance
up
with
a
smile
into
the
benevolent
old
face
above
her
and
she
stripped
back
the
glove
from
her
finger
with
a
dramatic
gesture
see
she
said
brightly
exhibiting
the
ring
by
the
bloodstone
on
my
finger
i
keep
my
oath
until
the
going
down
of
one
more
sun
you
a
brave
little
girl
that
what
you
are
said
barnaby
stooping
to
kiss
her
only
that
week
she
had
read
from
which
mary
was
quoting
and
she
knew
what
grim
determination
lay
beneath
the
light
tone
i
guess
it
will
help
you
the
same
way
it
did
the
poor
jester
to
remember
that
it
only
one
day
at
a
time
you
called
on
to
endure
and
another
thing
she
added
trying
to
put
as
many
consoling
thoughts
into
their
parting
as
possible
if
you
succeed
in
teaching
them
anything
that
help
to
snatch
them
as
brands
from
the
burning
it
will
count
for
a
star
in
your
crown
just
as
much
as
if
you
gone
out
and
converted
the
heathen
on
coral
strand
it
not
stars
in
my
crown
i
working
for
laughed
mary
it
for
pence
in
my
purse
nevertheless
the
suggestion
stayed
with
her
all
the
way
home
when
conversation
flagged
she
filled
the
silences
with
pleasant
snatches
of
in
which
she
saw
herself
becoming
to
these
benighted
little
creatures
asleep
on
either
side
of
her
the
inspiration
that
madam
chartley
was
to
everyone
who
crossed
the
threshold
of
warwick
hall
i
just
to
do
something
to
make
them
see
themselves
as
they
look
to
other
people
she
thought
desperately
but
the
question
is
a
hard
problem
indeed
for
one
who
in
many
ways
was
still
only
a
child
herself
chapter
x
in
joyce
studio
it
was
a
wild
blustery
day
in
march
two
months
after
interrupted
visit
at
the
ranch
joyce
ware
sitting
before
the
glowing
wood
fire
in
the
studio
high
up
on
the
top
floor
of
a
new
york
apartment
house
had
never
known
such
a
lonesome
sunday
the
winds
that
rattled
the
casements
and
sent
alternate
dashes
of
rain
and
snow
against
the
panes
had
kept
her
all
day
usually
she
was
glad
to
have
one
of
these
days
after
a
busy
week
when
she
could
sit
and
do
nothing
with
a
clear
conscience
every
moan
of
the
wind
in
the
chimney
and
every
glimpse
of
the
roofs
below
her
windows
emphasized
the
luxurious
comfort
of
the
big
room
she
had
had
a
hard
week
trying
to
crowd
into
it
some
special
orders
for
easter
cards
a
year
ago
she
would
not
have
added
them
to
her
regular
work
but
now
she
was
afraid
to
turn
anything
away
which
might
help
to
swell
the
size
of
the
check
she
must
send
home
every
month
if
the
days
were
not
long
enough
to
do
the
tasks
she
set
for
herself
at
a
comfortable
pace
she
simply
worked
harder
feverishly
if
need
be
to
finish
them
she
had
been
practically
alone
the
entire
day
for
the
two
members
of
the
household
who
were
at
home
were
staying
in
their
own
rooms
lucy
boyd
had
a
cold
and
her
devoted
little
aunt
was
nursing
her
with
the
care
of
the
traditional
hen
for
its
one
chicken
boyd
had
not
allowed
lucy
to
leave
her
room
even
for
her
sunday
dinner
but
had
carried
it
in
to
her
with
her
own
on
a
tray
as
miss
henrietta
robbins
was
spending
the
in
the
country
joyce
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
set
the
table
for
herself
but
ate
her
own
dinner
in
the
little
kitchenette
afterward
to
make
the
day
as
different
as
possible
from
the
six
others
in
the
week
in
which
she
sat
at
her
easel
from
morning
till
night
in
a
gingham
apron
she
went
into
her
room
and
put
on
a
dress
of
her
own
designing
soft
and
trailing
and
of
a
warm
pushing
a
great
chair
close
enough
to
the
hearth
for
the
tips
of
her
slippers
to
rest
on
the
shining
brass
she
settled
herself
among
the
cushions
with
a
book
which
she
had
long
been
trying
to
find
time
to
read
the
story
like
the
bleak
outdoor
world
seemed
to
accentuate
her
sense
of
shelter
and
comfort
but
at
the
same
time
it
somehow
emphasized
her
loneliness
now
and
then
when
her
eyes
grew
tired
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
around
her
there
were
several
things
which
gave
her
keen
pleasure
every
time
her
attention
was
called
to
them
which
she
felt
ought
to
be
enough
of
themselves
to
dispel
her
vague
depression
the
odor
of
growing
mignonette
the
sunny
yellow
of
the
pot
of
daffodils
on
the
black
teakwood
table
the
gleam
of
firelight
on
the
brasses
and
the
warm
shadows
it
cast
on
the
trailing
folds
of
her
dress
that
lighting
was
exactly
what
she
wanted
for
some
drapery
folds
which
she
would
be
putting
on
a
magazine
cover
next
week
she
studied
the
effect
thinking
lazily
that
if
it
were
not
her
one
day
of
rest
she
would
get
out
palette
and
brushes
and
make
a
sketch
of
what
she
wanted
to
keep
while
it
was
before
her
she
read
for
over
two
hours
when
the
story
came
to
an
unhappy
ending
she
dropped
the
book
wishing
she
had
never
come
across
such
a
tale
of
misfortune
and
misunderstanding
it
depressed
her
strangely
and
presently
as
she
sat
looking
into
the
fire
the
unbroken
quiet
of
the
big
room
gave
her
an
overwhelming
sense
of
loneliness
that
was
like
an
ache
i
give
anything
to
walk
in
and
see
what
they
all
doing
at
home
right
now
she
thought
as
she
stared
into
the
red
embers
but
i
even
picture
them
as
they
really
are
because
they
are
no
longer
living
in
any
place
that
i
ever
called
home
the
thought
of
their
being
off
in
a
strange
little
texas
town
that
she
had
never
seen
made
her
feel
far
more
forlorn
and
apart
than
she
would
have
felt
could
she
have
imagined
them
with
any
of
the
familiar
backgrounds
she
had
once
shared
with
them
they
seemed
as
far
away
and
out
of
reach
as
they
had
been
that
winter
in
france
when
she
used
to
climb
up
in
monsieur
greyville
pear
tree
and
cry
for
sheer
homesickness
that
was
years
ago
and
before
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
had
opened
to
give
her
a
playmate
but
she
recalled
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
the
performance
that
often
took
place
in
the
pear
tree
she
began
by
repeating
that
couplet
from
the
dear
home
faces
whereupon
the
fitful
firelight
paled
and
shone
it
was
like
a
charm
for
it
always
brought
a
blur
of
tears
through
which
she
could
see
as
in
a
magic
mirror
each
home
face
as
she
had
seen
it
oftenest
in
the
little
brown
house
in
plainsville
there
was
her
mother
so
patient
and
gentle
and
tired
bending
over
the
sewing
which
never
came
to
an
end
and
jack
charging
home
from
school
like
a
young
whirlwind
to
do
his
chores
and
get
out
to
play
she
could
see
mary
with
her
dear
earnest
little
freckled
face
and
beribboned
pigtails
always
so
eager
to
help
even
when
she
was
so
small
that
she
had
to
stand
on
a
to
reach
the
such
a
capable
motherly
little
atom
she
was
then
looking
after
the
wants
of
holland
and
the
baby
untiringly
despite
the
ache
in
her
throat
a
smile
crossed
joyce
face
now
and
then
as
she
went
on
calling
up
other
scenes
they
had
had
hard
work
at
the
wigwam
and
had
felt
the
pinch
of
poverty
but
she
had
never
known
a
family
who
found
more
to
laugh
over
and
enjoy
when
they
looked
back
over
their
hard
times
but
now
the
change
was
more
than
she
could
bear
to
think
of
jack
a
hopeless
cripple
mary
tied
down
to
the
uncongenial
work
that
she
had
to
take
up
as
a
breadwinner
when
she
ought
to
be
free
to
enjoy
the
best
part
of
her
girlhood
as
other
girls
were
doing
tears
came
into
joyce
eyes
as
she
brooded
over
the
pictures
she
had
conjured
up
then
she
rose
and
trailing
into
her
bedroom
came
back
with
a
lapful
of
letters
all
that
the
family
had
written
her
since
leaving
lone
rock
four
months
ago
dropping
on
the
she
arranged
them
in
little
piles
beside
her
according
to
their
dates
and
beginning
at
the
first
proceeded
to
read
them
through
in
order
they
did
bring
the
family
nearer
as
she
had
expected
them
to
do
but
the
later
ones
brought
such
a
weight
of
foreboding
with
their
second
reading
that
presently
she
buried
her
face
in
the
cushions
of
the
chair
against
which
she
was
leaning
and
began
to
cry
as
she
had
not
cried
for
nearly
a
year
not
since
the
first
news
of
jack
accident
had
she
given
way
to
such
a
storm
of
tears
it
was
some
time
before
she
sobbed
herself
quiet
and
then
she
still
sat
with
her
head
in
the
cushions
till
she
heard
the
faint
buzz
of
an
electric
doorbell
it
sounded
so
far
away
that
she
thought
it
was
the
bell
of
the
adjoining
apartment
and
gave
it
no
more
than
a
passing
thought
so
too
the
sound
of
an
opening
door
of
an
umbrella
dropped
into
a
of
voices
seemed
to
have
but
a
vague
connection
with
her
world
then
she
was
startled
by
hearing
boyd
voice
at
the
portière
saying
joyce
dear
here
is
tremont
to
see
you
ah
i
you
were
asleep
he
rang
twice
so
i
answered
the
bell
phil
tremont
pausing
between
the
portières
as
boyd
slipped
back
to
lucy
caught
only
a
glimpse
of
joyce
red
dress
trailing
through
the
opposite
doorway
the
scattered
letters
on
the
rug
bore
witness
to
her
hurried
flight
come
on
in
to
the
fire
phil
she
called
through
the
partly
closed
door
poke
it
up
and
make
yourself
at
home
i
be
out
in
a
minute
i
never
dreamed
of
such
joy
as
a
caller
on
this
dreadful
day
or
i
should
have
been
sitting
up
in
state
waiting
to
receive
you
the
laughing
reply
he
sent
back
brightened
her
spirits
as
if
by
magic
the
next
best
thing
to
having
one
of
her
own
family
suddenly
appear
was
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
friend
who
had
made
one
of
their
home
circle
so
often
and
so
intimately
in
the
old
wigwam
days
which
she
had
just
been
crying
over
hastily
smoothing
her
rumpled
hair
bathing
her
eyes
and
fluffing
a
over
her
nose
to
take
away
the
shine
which
her
handkerchief
had
left
on
it
she
came
out
to
find
him
standing
before
the
fire
looking
down
suspiciously
at
the
scattered
letters
as
he
stepped
forward
with
a
hearty
she
felt
that
the
keen
glance
he
gave
her
was
a
question
and
answered
as
if
he
had
spoken
aloud
no
i
was
asleep
as
boyd
thought
i
was
just
having
a
good
cry
a
regular
bawl
i
do
get
a
chance
to
indulge
in
such
an
orgy
of
weeps
often
but
now
the
storm
is
over
and
it
has
cleared
the
atmosphere
for
another
year
or
so
what
is
it
joyce
bad
news
from
home
is
jack
worse
phil
voice
was
so
sympathetic
his
real
concern
so
evident
that
joyce
could
not
trust
herself
to
answer
immediately
she
stooped
and
began
to
pick
up
the
letters
i
i
afraid
i
boasted
too
soon
about
the
storm
being
over
have
to
talk
about
something
else
for
awhile
or
i
might
tune
up
again
all
right
he
answered
in
a
soothing
tone
reaching
down
to
help
her
gather
up
the
letters
that
suits
me
anyhow
for
i
came
on
purpose
to
bring
you
a
rare
bit
of
news
concerning
the
tremont
family
in
her
present
mood
the
mere
sight
of
phil
broad
shoulders
was
a
comfort
they
might
not
be
able
to
lift
her
actual
burdens
but
she
felt
their
willingness
and
his
unspoken
sympathy
steadied
her
like
an
outstretched
hand
now
with
the
consideration
that
was
one
of
his
most
lovable
traits
he
gave
her
time
to
compose
herself
by
rattling
on
in
a
joking
way
about
himself
i
come
a
long
distance
in
the
rain
and
snow
to
tell
my
news
torn
myself
away
from
all
the
wiles
of
stuart
and
eugenia
to
keep
their
only
brother
with
them
i
braved
the
dangers
of
greater
new
york
and
defied
the
elements
in
order
to
be
the
bearer
of
such
important
tidings
and
you
need
think
i
going
to
give
it
to
you
as
if
it
were
any
common
bit
of
information
i
tell
you
what
i
do
you
may
have
three
guesses
if
you
fail
you
pay
a
forfeit
say
an
invitation
to
supper
with
the
privilege
of
my
helping
get
it
ready
in
that
tabloid
kitchen
of
yours
that
is
highly
satisfactory
agreed
joyce
whose
voice
was
under
control
by
this
time
she
drew
her
chair
a
trifle
closer
to
the
fire
and
leaning
her
elbows
on
her
knees
looked
into
the
embers
for
inspiration
it
concerns
the
tremont
family
she
mused
that
means
all
of
you
well
it
must
be
that
the
old
tangle
about
your
holdings
in
england
has
been
settled
and
you
coming
into
some
money
after
all
these
years
no
guess
again
picking
up
the
long
brass
tongs
she
began
to
trace
pictures
on
the
sooty
background
of
the
chimney
while
she
tried
to
think
of
a
better
answer
it
concerns
of
you
yes
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
phil
walked
over
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
over
the
wide
stretch
of
city
roofs
below
now
almost
hidden
by
the
rapidly
deepening
twilight
he
was
smiling
while
he
waited
and
humming
half
under
his
breath
a
song
that
his
old
english
nurse
used
to
sing
to
him
and
his
sister
elsie
maid
elsie
roams
by
lane
and
lea
he
had
whistled
it
almost
constantly
the
last
few
days
kling
she
seems
to
hear
her
ring
her
bonnie
ring
he
hummed
it
again
when
joyce
second
guess
was
wrong
while
he
waited
for
the
third
then
when
it
too
was
wide
of
the
mark
and
she
demanded
to
be
told
he
began
it
again
but
this
time
he
sang
it
meaningly
and
loud
enough
to
fill
the
room
with
the
deep
sweet
notes
a
year
by
seas
a
year
by
lands
a
year
since
then
has
died
and
elsie
at
the
altar
stands
her
sailor
at
her
side
while
kling
lang
ling
their
bonnie
gaily
ring
joyce
face
grew
bright
with
sudden
understanding
as
he
finished
and
she
cried
elsie
is
to
be
married
is
what
you
came
to
tell
me
yes
my
littlest
onliest
sister
is
to
be
married
immediately
after
easter
out
in
california
in
the
you
have
heard
so
much
about
we
are
all
going
daddy
and
stuart
and
eugenia
and
little
patricia
and
your
obedient
servant
pill
himself
he
left
the
window
and
stretching
himself
out
in
the
big
chair
opposite
hers
gave
her
the
details
that
she
instantly
demanded
elsie
sailor
lad
is
a
navy
surgeon
the
wedding
is
to
be
in
the
because
there
is
where
they
first
met
and
there
is
where
elsie
has
had
all
the
best
times
of
her
life
she
has
always
lived
with
mother
people
you
know
since
our
home
was
broken
up
and
even
before
mother
death
we
used
to
spend
our
winters
there
yes
daddy
opposed
the
marriage
at
first
but
you
know
daddy
he
hardly
think
an
archangel
good
enough
for
elsie
the
news
had
the
effect
which
phil
had
foreseen
and
joyce
own
affairs
retired
into
the
background
while
she
discussed
the
matter
which
was
of
such
vital
importance
to
the
whole
tremont
family
later
he
asked
her
to
name
all
the
things
she
considered
the
most
desirable
and
unique
as
wedding
gifts
and
they
were
still
adding
to
the
list
from
which
he
was
to
make
his
choice
when
they
heard
boyd
come
out
into
the
hall
to
turn
on
the
light
in
the
bright
firelight
they
had
not
noticed
how
dark
it
had
grown
outside
joyce
looked
at
the
clock
and
sprang
up
exclaiming
lucy
will
be
wanting
her
cream
toast
and
it
time
also
for
me
to
pay
my
forfeit
to
you
how
much
of
a
supper
are
you
going
to
claim
young
man
that
depends
on
how
many
good
there
are
in
the
pantry
and
said
phil
rising
also
i
come
and
investigate
myself
thank
you
pinning
up
the
train
of
her
red
gown
and
tying
on
a
big
apron
joyce
made
quick
work
of
her
supper
preparations
and
the
long
lonely
day
ended
in
a
jolly
little
feast
which
completely
restored
her
to
her
usual
cheerful
outlook
on
life
boyd
joined
them
despite
the
fact
that
she
must
leave
lucy
to
eat
alone
in
order
to
do
so
it
was
always
a
day
in
her
drab
existence
when
phil
tremont
came
into
it
she
was
such
a
literal
little
body
that
she
never
joked
herself
she
was
mentally
incapable
of
the
repartee
that
always
flew
back
and
forth
across
the
table
when
phil
was
a
guest
but
she
considered
his
tamest
sallies
as
positively
brilliant
when
she
went
back
to
lucy
she
had
enough
material
to
furnish
conversation
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
now
said
phil
when
he
and
joyce
were
back
in
the
studio
again
before
the
fire
i
do
want
to
upset
your
equanimity
but
if
you
can
talk
about
it
calmly
i
like
to
hear
exactly
how
things
are
going
with
jack
and
aunt
emily
and
that
little
brick
of
a
mary
i
had
one
letter
from
jack
the
first
of
the
winter
and
i
had
the
casual
reports
you
given
me
at
long
intervals
but
i
no
adequate
idea
of
their
whereabouts
or
their
present
sayings
and
doings
suppose
i
read
you
some
of
mary
letters
proposed
joyce
i
been
surprised
at
the
gift
she
developed
lately
for
describing
her
surroundings
really
she
done
some
in
answer
to
his
pleased
assent
joyce
turned
over
the
letters
till
she
came
to
the
first
one
that
mary
had
written
from
bauer
it
was
written
on
pieces
of
a
paper
while
she
was
getting
supper
explained
joyce
but
you
can
fairly
see
the
little
town
spread
out
between
the
spire
of
peter
and
the
tower
of
the
holy
academy
with
the
windmills
in
between
and
the
new
moon
low
on
the
horizon
phil
lounging
back
in
the
big
chair
sat
with
a
smile
on
his
face
as
he
listened
to
mary
account
of
the
rector
call
while
she
was
perched
up
on
the
windmill
but
when
joyce
reached
the
closing
paragraph
about
its
being
a
good
old
world
after
all
and
her
belief
in
grandmother
ware
verse
that
the
crooked
should
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
places
smooth
a
very
tender
light
shone
in
his
keen
eyes
he
said
in
a
low
tone
the
dear
little
vicar
she
game
to
the
core
urged
to
read
more
joyce
went
on
sometimes
choosing
only
an
extract
here
and
there
sometimes
reading
an
entire
letter
till
he
had
heard
all
about
her
visit
to
gay
her
first
experience
at
a
military
hop
their
brave
attempt
to
make
a
merry
christmas
among
strangers
and
finally
her
experience
with
the
mallory
children
because
of
their
desperate
need
of
money
do
skip
insisted
phil
still
laughing
over
her
account
of
her
day
of
rest
at
the
barnaby
ranch
when
the
peacock
lost
its
tail
the
next
one
is
funny
replied
joyce
but
it
is
especially
interesting
to
me
because
it
shows
how
mary
is
growing
up
she
hunted
through
the
disordered
pile
until
she
found
one
dated
two
months
ago
night
after
i
brought
brud
and
sister
back
from
the
ranch
i
lay
awake
for
hours
trying
to
think
what
to
do
next
to
find
the
vulnerable
spot
in
my
i
could
think
of
a
thing
but
decided
to
begin
telling
them
kipling
jungle
stories
instead
of
any
more
and
to
try
barnaby
suggestion
of
making
them
responsible
for
their
own
entertainment
part
of
the
time
oh
this
is
the
one
i
thought
exclaimed
joyce
it
goes
on
to
tell
about
the
last
news
from
holland
instead
of
the
children
here
is
the
one
i
wanted
written
two
weeks
later
columbia
happy
land
i
found
the
open
sesame
thanks
to
kipling
and
in
a
way
i
little
expected
the
children
showed
a
breathless
interest
in
the
jungle
stories
from
the
start
and
began
dramatizing
them
of
their
own
accord
they
have
thrown
themselves
into
the
play
with
a
zest
which
nothing
of
my
proposing
has
ever
called
out
for
two
weeks
i
have
been
old
baloo
the
brown
bear
and
father
wolf
by
turns
there
are
two
little
hairless
in
our
version
however
for
a
mowglina
divides
honors
with
mowgli
sister
says
she
has
chosen
the
name
of
mowglina
for
keeps
and
i
sincerely
hope
she
has
if
what
sammy
bradford
said
about
names
having
a
moral
effect
on
her
is
true
have
our
council
rock
up
on
the
high
hill
back
of
peter
where
meliss
sometimes
plays
the
part
of
the
black
panther
we
no
longer
greet
each
other
with
good
morning
it
is
good
hunting
now
and
when
we
part
it
is
with
the
benediction
jungle
favor
go
with
thee
you
remember
baloo
taught
the
wood
and
water
laws
to
mowgli
how
to
tell
a
rotten
branch
from
a
sound
one
how
to
speak
politely
to
the
wild
bees
when
he
came
upon
a
hive
of
them
etc
but
more
than
all
he
taught
the
master
words
of
the
jungle
that
turned
every
bird
beast
and
snake
into
a
friend
it
is
simply
amazing
to
me
the
way
they
seemed
to
be
charmed
by
that
idea
and
it
is
strange
that
such
utterly
lawless
children
should
be
not
only
willing
but
eager
to
abide
by
the
rules
laid
down
for
animals
it
does
my
soul
good
to
hear
brud
who
has
never
obeyed
anyone
gravely
declaim
now
these
are
the
laws
of
the
jungle
and
many
and
mighty
are
they
but
the
head
and
the
hoof
of
the
law
and
the
haunch
and
the
hump
is
to
hear
saucy
little
sister
in
the
rôle
of
mowglina
repeating
kaa
words
to
uncle
august
a
brave
heart
a
courteous
they
will
carry
thee
far
through
the
jungle
manling
was
uncle
august
bless
his
old
brown
body
who
helped
me
to
make
my
first
personal
application
of
the
play
i
had
just
heard
of
their
latest
prank
sad
to
say
the
more
angelic
they
are
as
little
wolves
the
more
annoying
they
are
when
they
return
to
the
they
had
dropped
a
live
garter
snake
a
one
through
the
slit
of
the
package
box
and
the
postmistress
had
picked
it
up
with
a
bundle
of
newspapers
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
yelled
like
a
comanche
and
then
had
a
nervous
chill
that
lasted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
same
day
they
filled
all
the
keyholes
of
the
private
letterboxes
with
as
far
up
as
they
could
reach
and
everybody
who
had
to
stop
to
pry
it
out
was
cross
did
say
anything
to
them
about
it
till
after
they
had
told
me
about
uncle
august
chasing
the
calves
out
of
williams
garden
and
how
she
had
petted
and
praised
him
for
it
we
talked
a
few
minutes
about
the
way
uncle
august
is
beloved
by
everybody
who
knows
him
and
how
even
strangers
on
the
street
stop
to
pat
his
head
or
say
something
kind
about
him
it
because
he
keeps
every
law
of
the
jungle
for
dogs
i
told
them
and
then
i
said
quite
mercilessly
but
the
whole
town
looks
on
you
two
children
as
mere
senseless
outcasts
who
have
no
leaders
and
no
laws
really
it
hurt
them
dreadfully
and
i
felt
almost
cruel
for
saying
it
i
could
see
that
the
shot
told
when
i
reminded
them
how
they
had
been
turned
out
of
the
hotel
and
chased
out
of
every
store
in
town
i
told
them
that
people
said
ugly
things
about
them
behind
their
backs
just
as
kaa
and
baloo
did
about
the
silly
gray
apes
who
threw
dirt
and
sticks
and
made
mischief
wherever
they
went
was
the
climax
they
both
threw
themselves
across
my
lap
and
began
to
cry
protesting
that
they
were
banderlogs
they
want
people
to
call
them
that
i
think
my
good
angel
must
have
inspired
me
to
make
the
little
sermon
that
i
gave
them
then
for
i
certainly
had
never
thought
of
the
analogy
before
how
the
same
thing
that
is
true
in
the
jungle
holds
good
in
the
that
we
must
learn
the
master
words
for
each
person
we
meet
so
that
every
heart
will
understand
when
we
call
out
we
be
of
one
blood
ye
and
i
that
just
as
the
elephants
and
kites
and
snakes
became
friendly
to
mowgli
as
soon
as
he
learned
the
master
words
of
their
speech
so
miss
edna
and
the
postmistress
and
old
sammy
would
be
friendly
to
them
when
they
showed
that
they
not
only
had
brave
hearts
which
scorned
to
play
little
mean
silly
tricks
but
as
well
amazing
part
of
it
is
that
they
understood
me
perfectly
and
right
then
and
there
had
a
sort
of
spiritual
awakening
to
the
fact
that
they
really
are
of
one
blood
with
these
people
they
have
been
tormenting
it
is
pathetic
to
watch
how
hard
they
have
been
trying
ever
since
to
convince
people
that
they
are
banderlogs
but
are
sensible
children
willing
to
be
governed
by
laws
that
they
never
understood
before
now
at
parting
they
insist
on
my
repeating
the
verse
wood
and
water
wind
and
tree
and
jungle
favor
go
with
thee
they
seem
to
believe
that
it
verily
holds
some
sort
of
hoodoo
spell
which
will
armor
them
with
magic
power
to
make
friends
sister
has
made
peace
with
the
postmistress
by
the
gift
of
a
crude
little
willow
basket
of
her
own
weaving
filled
with
wildflowers
it
met
with
such
a
gracious
reception
due
principally
to
private
explanation
beforehand
that
sister
fairly
squirmed
with
the
blessedness
of
giving
her
first
real
experience
of
that
sort
brud
used
his
hatchet
to
split
a
pine
box
into
kindling
and
presented
the
same
tied
in
neat
bundles
to
williams
her
surprise
and
voluble
thanks
also
solicited
beforehand
were
so
gratifying
that
brud
came
home
so
satisfied
with
the
new
application
of
the
game
that
he
burns
to
play
it
with
everyone
in
bauer
proving
with
actions
if
not
words
that
he
has
a
right
to
say
we
be
of
one
blood
ye
and
i
and
that
he
is
a
banderlog
as
joyce
slipped
the
letter
back
into
its
envelope
phil
leaned
forward
to
put
another
log
on
the
fire
saying
as
he
did
so
good
for
mary
she
always
manages
to
find
some
way
out
and
it
is
always
a
way
no
one
else
would
think
of
but
somehow
i
ca
quite
place
her
in
these
letters
she
the
same
little
bunch
of
energy
that
i
always
known
and
yet
there
a
difference
i
ca
quite
make
out
what
she
growing
up
i
tell
you
answered
joyce
that
what
makes
the
difference
listen
to
this
one
being
valentine
day
we
had
a
picnic
at
the
council
rock
the
hill
rises
straight
up
from
the
public
road
just
back
of
the
mallory
cottage
and
peter
there
is
a
roundabout
road
to
the
top
leading
in
from
a
back
lane
which
is
easy
to
climb
but
of
course
the
children
chose
the
steep
trail
starting
near
their
gate
nothing
but
a
goat
could
walk
up
it
with
perfect
ease
and
safety
at
the
top
the
view
is
lovely
you
can
see
over
half
the
county
and
look
right
down
into
the
chimneys
of
the
town
the
whole
hilltop
is
covered
with
wildflowers
strange
beautiful
things
i
have
never
seen
before
so
many
exquisite
colors
you
think
a
rainbow
had
been
broken
to
bits
and
scattered
over
the
ground
one
we
started
out
of
the
mallory
gate
the
most
grotesque
procession
that
ever
went
down
the
pike
of
bauer
you
see
we
dropped
the
jungle
game
for
the
day
and
they
were
doing
valentine
honor
i
went
first
in
my
oldest
dress
on
account
of
the
climb
my
mexican
hat
on
my
head
my
as
usual
in
one
hand
and
a
thermos
bottle
in
the
other
i
was
taking
some
boiling
water
along
to
make
them
tea
as
a
great
treat
they
do
like
it
particularly
but
they
wanted
to
use
a
little
japanese
that
had
just
been
sent
to
them
fired
by
some
of
my
descriptions
of
valentine
costumes
had
elected
to
attend
the
picnic
as
the
queen
of
hearts
and
had
dressed
herself
for
the
part
with
the
assistance
of
meliss
she
looked
perfectly
ridiculous
spotted
all
over
with
calico
hearts
they
were
sewed
on
her
dress
her
hat
and
even
her
black
stockings
she
was
as
badly
broken
out
with
them
as
a
measles
patient
would
have
been
with
a
red
rash
would
let
her
dike
him
out
in
the
same
way
she
wanted
him
to
go
as
cupid
he
consented
to
let
her
call
him
cupid
and
he
carried
a
bow
and
arrow
and
wore
some
of
the
trimmings
but
he
wore
them
in
his
own
way
the
white
which
she
tried
to
attach
to
his
shoulderblades
he
wore
bound
to
his
brow
like
an
indian
uncle
august
frisked
about
in
a
most
remarkable
costume
i
think
it
must
have
been
made
of
the
top
section
of
brud
pajamas
with
the
sleeves
pulled
up
over
his
front
paws
and
buttoned
in
the
back
it
was
sprinkled
with
big
hearts
some
blue
and
some
yellow
funny
as
they
looked
meliss
was
the
comic
valentine
of
the
occasion
the
front
of
her
was
covered
with
an
old
lace
window
curtain
across
her
bosom
carefully
fastened
with
a
gilt
paper
arrow
was
the
lithographed
picture
of
a
big
red
heart
as
fat
and
red
and
shiny
as
a
ripe
tomato
she
carried
the
lunch
basket
must
confess
it
staggered
me
a
trifle
when
the
procession
came
out
to
meet
me
but
they
were
so
pleased
with
themselves
i
had
the
heart
to
suggest
a
single
change
i
led
on
hoping
that
we
would
meet
anyone
well
we
had
gone
a
hundred
paces
till
we
heard
and
a
solitary
horseman
came
riding
along
behind
us
brud
looked
back
and
then
piped
up
in
his
shrill
little
voice
oh
look
miss
mayry
look
at
the
soldier
man
coming
i
glanced
back
and
my
blood
fairly
ran
cold
for
there
riding
along
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
at
sight
of
our
ridiculous
turnout
was
lieutenant
boglin
i
was
so
amazed
at
seeing
him
that
i
just
stood
still
in
the
road
and
stared
feeling
my
face
get
redder
and
redder
somehow
i
had
no
power
to
move
he
did
recognize
me
till
he
was
opposite
us
but
the
instant
he
did
he
was
off
his
horse
and
coming
up
to
shake
hands
and
i
was
trying
to
account
for
our
appearance
it
seems
he
had
been
with
the
troops
up
at
leon
springs
for
target
practice
and
was
taking
a
day
off
while
they
were
breaking
camp
he
had
been
commissioned
to
look
at
a
polo
pony
somebody
had
for
sale
in
bauer
and
thought
while
he
was
about
it
he
would
call
and
see
the
ware
family
after
he
had
had
dinner
at
the
hotel
he
was
on
his
way
there
there
i
was
i
could
ask
him
to
go
on
such
a
babyfied
lark
as
our
valentine
picnic
i
could
leave
the
children
and
take
him
over
home
because
my
time
is
mallory
even
if
she
had
excused
me
the
children
would
have
raised
an
unstoppable
howl
and
probably
would
have
followed
us
they
are
making
grand
strides
in
the
courtesy
business
but
they
are
still
far
from
being
models
of
propriety
i
had
explained
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
told
him
i
would
be
through
at
five
and
asked
him
to
wait
and
take
supper
with
us
i
could
see
that
he
was
inwardly
convulsed
and
i
do
believe
it
was
because
we
all
looked
so
ridiculous
and
he
wanted
to
see
the
show
a
second
time
that
he
accepted
my
invitation
with
alacrity
as
soon
as
he
started
on
to
the
williams
house
i
stopped
under
a
tree
and
wrote
a
scrawl
to
mamma
on
the
margin
of
the
newspaper
that
was
spread
on
top
of
the
then
i
gave
meliss
a
dime
to
run
over
home
with
it
so
that
the
family
need
be
taken
by
surprise
if
bogey
happened
to
get
there
before
i
did
it
seems
that
he
forgot
the
directions
i
gave
him
for
finding
the
house
and
about
ten
minutes
to
five
as
the
children
and
meliss
were
finishing
the
lunch
which
was
spread
out
on
the
council
rock
he
came
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
hill
the
children
had
been
angelic
before
his
arrival
and
they
were
good
after
he
came
except
i
ca
explain
it
there
was
something
almost
impish
in
the
way
they
sat
and
watched
us
listening
to
everything
we
said
as
if
they
were
committing
it
to
memory
to
repeat
afterward
even
uncle
august
in
his
pajamas
squatted
solemnly
on
the
rock
beside
them
and
seemed
to
be
stowing
away
something
to
remember
lieutenant
could
glance
in
their
direction
without
laughing
out
loud
they
looked
so
utterly
comical
so
he
turned
his
back
on
them
and
began
to
admire
the
view
which
certainly
was
magnificent
as
the
sun
began
to
go
down
the
wind
came
up
and
the
veil
i
had
tied
around
my
hat
got
loose
and
streamed
out
like
a
comet
tail
i
could
tie
it
down
and
i
could
find
a
pin
to
fasten
it
and
first
thing
i
knew
he
had
taken
one
of
those
fancy
bronze
pins
from
the
collar
of
his
uniform
those
crossed
guns
that
officers
wear
you
know
and
he
gave
me
that
to
fasten
my
veil
with
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
that
gay
and
roberta
have
whole
rows
of
such
pins
that
different
officers
have
given
them
but
sister
pointed
her
finger
at
me
and
shrilled
out
like
a
katydid
as
if
they
had
been
discussing
the
subject
before
no
sir
brud
you
ca
fool
he
miss
mayry
valentine
he
her
you
could
have
heard
the
elfish
way
she
said
it
you
understand
why
it
should
have
embarrassed
me
so
dreadfully
my
face
felt
as
hot
as
a
fiery
furnace
he
sort
of
smiled
and
pretended
not
to
hear
and
i
could
think
of
a
word
to
break
the
awful
pause
but
just
then
the
hanging
on
a
bush
behind
us
went
off
with
a
whang
and
clatter
that
sent
us
both
springing
to
our
feet
had
finished
their
lunch
by
that
time
so
i
helped
meliss
hustle
the
dishes
into
the
basket
and
headed
the
party
for
home
as
soon
as
possible
you
can
imagine
the
deep
breath
of
thankfulness
i
drew
when
i
finally
left
them
at
their
own
gate
but
i
drew
it
too
soon
i
should
have
waited
until
we
were
out
of
earshot
for
as
they
went
racing
up
the
path
to
meet
their
mother
we
could
hear
them
shrieking
to
her
about
miss
mayry
valentine
beau
who
gave
her
two
teeny
weeny
guns
to
pin
her
veil
with
wind
was
blowing
so
hard
down
where
we
were
then
so
as
we
went
along
i
said
in
a
careless
sort
of
way
oh
we
forget
return
this
now
and
started
to
take
it
out
of
my
veil
but
he
only
laughed
and
said
with
such
a
mischievous
glance
no
keep
it
mayry
lest
you
forget
your
valentine
it
was
one
of
jack
good
days
and
he
was
able
to
be
out
in
the
and
the
two
took
to
each
other
at
once
you
know
nobody
can
give
people
quite
such
a
gentle
gracious
reception
as
mamma
can
and
much
as
i
had
dreaded
taking
him
into
such
a
barely
furnished
little
house
and
serving
him
from
our
motley
collection
of
dishes
i
did
mind
it
at
all
after
she
had
made
him
welcome
such
things
matter
so
much
when
you
a
family
you
can
be
proud
of
had
a
delicious
supper
and
he
ate
and
ate
and
said
nothing
had
tasted
so
good
since
he
left
home
years
ago
to
enlist
he
stayed
till
ten
and
then
went
down
to
the
livery
stable
to
get
his
horse
and
ride
back
to
camp
by
moonlight
we
sat
up
for
nearly
an
hour
after
he
left
comparing
notes
on
how
we
had
enjoyed
the
evening
and
talking
over
all
he
had
said
jack
said
it
was
like
coming
across
a
well
in
a
thirsty
desert
to
meet
a
fellow
like
that
and
mamma
said
she
was
sure
he
had
enjoyed
his
little
taste
of
simple
home
life
quite
as
much
as
we
had
enjoyed
having
him
he
quite
captivated
her
especially
when
he
asked
permission
to
come
again
norman
was
so
impressed
that
he
has
been
talking
ever
since
about
the
advantages
of
being
an
army
man
as
for
me
i
found
him
lots
more
interesting
than
he
was
the
night
of
the
hop
although
i
must
say
i
always
remember
him
as
a
sort
of
guardian
angel
that
night
for
being
so
kind
and
saving
me
from
being
a
there
was
a
peculiar
expression
on
phil
face
as
joyce
laid
down
that
letter
do
you
know
he
said
gravely
i
feel
as
if
i
been
seeing
the
little
vicar
grow
up
right
under
my
very
eyes
i
never
before
thought
of
her
as
being
old
enough
to
have
but
this
seems
to
give
promise
of
blossoming
into
one
of
course
it
what
one
might
naturally
expect
but
somehow
i
ca
quite
get
used
to
the
idea
and
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
aloud
but
as
he
scowled
into
the
fire
he
added
to
himself
do
like
chapter
xi
phil
goes
to
warwick
hall
had
it
not
been
for
that
package
of
letters
read
aloud
before
the
fire
on
that
stormy
march
night
this
story
might
have
had
a
very
different
ending
but
for
them
phil
never
would
have
known
what
a
winsome
unselfish
character
the
little
vicar
had
grown
up
to
be
the
casual
meetings
of
years
could
not
have
revealed
her
to
him
as
did
these
intimate
glimpses
of
her
daily
life
and
thought
through
her
letters
to
joyce
they
showed
her
childishly
jubilant
in
her
delight
when
the
first
month
salary
was
paid
into
her
hands
and
yet
practical
and
womanly
in
her
plans
for
spending
it
like
a
child
she
was
too
in
her
laments
over
some
of
the
mistakes
which
her
inexperience
led
her
into
with
brud
and
sister
yet
he
could
see
plainly
underneath
her
whimsical
words
her
deep
earnestness
of
purpose
at
last
she
had
recognized
that
this
opportunity
to
impress
them
with
her
high
ideals
was
one
of
the
calls
and
she
was
bending
every
energy
to
the
keeping
of
that
tryst
it
was
this
development
of
character
which
interested
phil
even
more
than
the
news
of
the
letters
still
there
were
a
number
of
items
which
gave
him
something
to
think
about
lieutenant
boglin
had
made
a
second
visit
once
she
mentioned
a
book
he
had
sent
her
and
another
time
a
rare
butterfly
to
add
to
the
new
collection
she
was
starting
evidently
they
had
found
several
interests
in
common
on
his
last
visit
she
had
taken
him
to
fernbank
in
the
boat
and
he
had
captured
a
fine
big
hairy
tarantula
for
her
from
among
the
roots
of
a
clump
of
maidenhair
ferns
she
had
been
able
to
enjoy
the
boat
a
great
deal
more
since
the
children
had
learned
the
meaning
of
the
word
obey
she
could
take
them
with
her
now
without
fear
of
their
rocking
the
boat
and
in
consequence
they
had
had
many
a
delightful
hour
on
the
water
that
had
not
been
possible
before
do
you
know
said
phil
slowly
when
he
had
listened
awhile
longer
it
does
strike
me
that
those
are
particularly
doleful
letters
at
any
rate
anything
to
send
you
into
an
of
weeps
i
believe
it
is
nothing
but
the
weather
which
gave
you
the
spell
of
doldrums
that
you
were
in
when
i
came
oh
but
you
have
heard
the
latest
ones
joyce
exclaimed
reports
of
jack
condition
and
jack
own
little
pencilled
scrawls
i
can
read
between
the
lines
just
what
a
desperate
fight
he
is
making
and
this
last
one
from
mary
simply
knocked
all
the
props
out
from
under
the
hope
i
had
been
clinging
to
she
picked
up
the
last
envelope
on
the
pile
postmarked
march
first
and
turned
to
the
closing
pages
is
so
much
worse
that
i
can
scarcely
think
of
anything
else
we
are
worried
about
him
he
is
in
bed
all
the
time
now
and
is
growing
so
thin
and
weak
he
is
very
despondent
something
new
for
him
it
keeps
us
busy
trying
to
think
of
things
to
tempt
his
appetite
or
to
arouse
him
out
of
his
listlessness
he
has
always
been
so
cheerful
before
so
full
of
jokes
and
so
responsive
to
any
attempt
to
amuse
him
but
now
he
does
seem
to
want
to
talk
or
to
be
read
to
or
anything
once
in
a
while
he
smile
a
wan
little
sort
of
smile
when
i
repeat
some
of
the
children
doings
but
he
is
like
himself
any
more
sometimes
i
believe
he
just
worn
out
with
the
long
effort
he
made
to
be
brave
and
keep
up
for
our
sake
is
hard
for
me
to
keep
my
interest
in
the
children
keyed
up
to
the
proper
pitch
any
more
when
all
the
time
i
am
thinking
how
pitiful
and
white
he
looks
lying
back
on
his
pillows
i
am
telling
you
exactly
how
things
are
because
i
would
want
you
to
tell
me
if
i
were
in
your
place
and
you
in
mine
i
can
understand
how
hard
it
is
for
you
to
be
so
far
away
where
you
ca
see
for
yourself
how
he
is
every
hour
i
try
to
send
a
note
or
postal
each
day
illustration
mary
ware
in
texas
leaning
against
the
mantel
looked
down
at
her
thoughtfully
talked
about
you
a
lot
lately
says
you
have
the
pioneer
spirit
of
all
our
old
colonial
grandmothers
to
stick
to
your
post
the
way
you
are
doing
for
our
sakes
he
constantly
referring
to
things
that
happened
at
the
wigwam
and
to
the
people
who
used
to
come
there
ellested
and
the
lees
and
phil
especially
phil
i
wish
he
could
drop
in
here
to
see
us
daily
as
he
used
to
do
in
arizona
maybe
jack
would
rouse
up
and
take
some
interest
in
he
does
take
any
now
in
the
people
we
have
met
here
although
no
one
could
be
kinder
than
the
rochesters
and
the
barnabys
have
been
to
us
joyce
finished
reading
and
phil
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
long
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
as
if
he
were
considering
some
weighty
problem
finally
he
stopped
and
leaning
against
the
mantel
looked
down
at
her
thoughtfully
saying
joyce
i
about
thought
out
a
way
to
manage
it
to
take
in
bauer
on
my
way
to
california
i
mean
you
told
me
once
that
aunt
emily
calls
me
her
boy
well
you
all
are
my
other
family
and
these
glimpses
you
given
me
of
it
make
me
homesick
to
see
them
i
might
be
able
to
help
matters
some
way
i
almost
sure
i
can
arrange
to
start
several
days
before
the
rest
of
the
party
and
go
around
that
way
so
if
you
have
any
messages
or
things
to
send
get
them
ready
oh
phil
she
cried
thankfully
they
be
so
glad
i
know
it
will
do
them
a
world
of
good
to
see
you
maybe
you
can
cheer
jack
up
a
bit
so
much
depends
on
keeping
him
hopeful
then
she
added
wistfully
i
only
wish
you
could
put
me
in
your
pocket
and
take
me
along
i
wish
i
could
he
answered
cordially
then
more
cordially
still
after
a
moment
thought
why
that
the
very
thing
come
and
go
along
just
cut
loose
for
a
short
visit
and
let
things
here
go
hang
it
would
mean
more
to
them
at
home
to
see
you
again
than
the
few
dollars
you
could
pile
up
if
you
stayed
on
here
no
she
contradicted
sadly
the
light
dying
out
of
her
eyes
which
had
brightened
at
the
mere
thought
of
such
a
visit
it
too
long
a
trip
and
too
expensive
and
but
we
can
easily
arrange
all
that
he
interrupted
eagerly
under
the
circumstances
you
ought
to
let
me
do
for
jack
sister
what
jack
would
gladly
do
for
mine
were
the
circumstances
reversed
joyce
she
shook
her
head
as
he
urged
his
plan
but
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
said
brokenly
you
are
a
dear
generous
boy
to
offer
it
and
i
remember
it
always
but
phil
do
you
see
there
too
much
at
stake
i
leave
now
not
only
my
work
in
hand
would
stop
but
lose
the
orders
that
are
constantly
coming
in
and
i
ca
afford
to
miss
a
penny
that
would
add
to
jack
comfort
in
any
way
he
may
be
helpless
for
years
and
years
and
mary
salary
will
stop
as
soon
as
the
mallorys
leave
bauer
this
summer
well
think
about
it
anyway
urged
phil
hopefully
maybe
you
see
things
differently
by
daylight
and
change
your
mind
i
ring
you
up
in
the
morning
by
the
way
he
said
a
few
minutes
later
when
he
was
slipping
into
his
overcoat
do
write
to
mary
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
my
going
to
bauer
if
i
should
go
i
want
to
surprise
her
very
well
agreed
joyce
but
i
may
write
about
elsie
wedding
and
say
that
you
all
be
going
west
oh
yes
she
probably
have
cards
herself
soon
for
elsie
has
never
forgotten
her
one
encounter
with
the
little
vicar
and
she
wrote
for
her
address
some
time
ago
it
was
several
days
before
joyce
saw
phil
again
when
he
did
come
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
did
not
wait
for
the
elevator
which
seemed
to
be
stuck
somewhere
in
the
basement
after
several
impatient
rings
he
started
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
and
had
reached
the
fifth
floor
before
the
elevator
overtook
him
he
was
slightly
out
of
breath
but
so
intent
on
his
errand
that
he
never
would
have
thought
to
step
in
and
ride
the
rest
of
the
way
had
it
not
stopped
on
the
landing
for
another
passenger
as
he
was
about
to
pass
the
cage
the
janitor
was
cleaning
the
halls
of
the
top
floor
apartments
and
the
door
into
joyce
studio
being
open
phil
walked
in
without
waiting
to
ring
joyce
was
at
her
easel
hard
at
work
her
face
lighted
up
when
she
saw
his
for
it
showed
so
plainly
he
was
the
bearer
of
good
news
daddy
going
with
me
were
his
first
breathless
words
of
greeting
we
then
he
paused
as
if
some
sudden
recollection
warned
him
to
ask
what
have
you
heard
from
home
lately
she
thought
the
question
was
prompted
by
his
fear
that
it
might
not
be
convenient
for
them
to
have
guests
in
the
house
if
jack
were
so
ill
so
she
hastened
to
reassure
him
oh
i
had
the
cheerfulest
sort
of
letter
from
mamma
this
morning
written
last
sunday
the
very
day
i
was
crying
my
eyes
out
over
them
is
that
always
the
way
here
it
was
so
bleak
and
blustery
that
i
could
help
imagining
that
they
were
as
dismal
as
i
and
all
the
time
it
was
as
warm
as
summer
in
bauer
the
country
a
mass
of
wildflowers
and
they
were
having
a
perfectly
delightful
time
with
gay
melville
and
guess
who
had
gone
up
with
her
to
spend
the
day
there
alex
shelby
of
kentucky
she
added
without
an
instant
pause
for
him
to
answer
mamma
wrote
that
she
did
know
when
she
had
had
such
an
enjoyable
day
shelby
insisted
on
her
going
for
a
little
outing
with
the
girls
while
he
and
norman
took
care
of
jack
mary
poled
them
up
to
fernbank
in
the
boat
and
when
they
got
back
they
found
that
in
some
unaccountable
way
jack
had
been
wonderfully
cheered
up
he
seemed
more
like
himself
than
he
had
been
for
weeks
mamma
was
so
happy
over
that
for
even
if
he
can
never
be
any
better
physically
it
is
a
lot
to
be
thankful
for
to
have
his
spirits
kept
up
is
that
all
asked
phil
when
she
paused
at
last
yes
why
is
that
i
only
wanted
to
find
out
how
much
you
knew
before
i
broke
news
now
listen
to
this
alex
shelby
wrote
to
daddy
that
same
night
you
know
they
met
at
eugenia
wedding
and
shelby
who
was
just
beginning
to
practise
medicine
then
seemed
to
develop
a
case
of
for
father
shelby
has
taken
a
great
interest
in
jack
case
ever
since
he
heard
of
the
accident
and
the
reason
he
sent
aunt
emily
out
that
afternoon
was
that
he
might
have
a
chance
to
examine
jack
without
her
knowing
it
he
did
want
to
raise
anybody
hopes
if
nothing
can
be
done
he
thinks
that
the
first
operation
did
not
go
quite
far
enough
there
is
still
a
pressure
on
the
spinal
cord
which
may
be
removed
by
a
very
delicate
bit
of
surgery
do
understand
his
technical
terms
but
it
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
known
to
the
medical
profession
daddy
says
there
are
very
few
cases
on
record
of
its
having
been
done
successfully
although
it
has
been
attempted
several
times
personally
he
knows
of
two
cases
one
was
a
football
player
in
this
country
who
had
his
back
broken
and
one
was
a
man
in
germany
who
was
injured
in
exactly
the
same
vertebræ
where
jack
trouble
lies
and
mark
this
now
helped
with
that
the
surgeon
who
performed
it
was
a
friend
of
his
and
called
him
in
because
it
was
such
a
rare
and
peculiar
case
joyce
was
scarcely
breathing
now
as
she
listened
she
was
white
to
the
lips
in
her
intense
excitement
oh
go
she
exclaimed
unable
to
endure
the
suspense
when
he
paused
doctor
tremont
thinks
he
can
cure
him
no
was
the
guarded
response
he
is
not
sure
he
does
say
that
but
there
is
a
chance
just
one
chance
and
he
is
going
to
take
it
we
leaving
in
a
few
hours
so
i
have
another
moment
to
stay
joyce
who
had
risen
in
her
first
excitement
dropped
back
on
her
stool
again
limp
and
trembling
she
had
thought
so
long
of
jack
illness
as
being
hopeless
that
the
possibility
of
a
cure
almost
unnerved
her
with
the
great
joy
of
it
phil
went
on
rapidly
shelby
told
jack
of
his
hope
but
evidently
he
said
nothing
to
the
rest
of
the
family
or
they
would
have
known
the
reason
for
jack
return
to
cheerfulness
now
do
go
to
getting
upset
like
that
he
added
holding
out
his
hands
for
a
cordial
i
do
want
to
get
your
hopes
up
too
high
but
i
always
felt
that
daddy
could
come
as
near
to
working
miracles
as
anyone
living
and
you
just
remember
this
he
going
to
work
one
this
time
if
mortal
man
can
do
it
you
see
he
knows
what
the
wares
were
to
me
that
year
on
the
desert
he
has
forgotten
how
you
all
saved
his
motherless
boy
for
him
the
way
he
puts
it
saved
me
from
my
besetting
temptation
and
sent
me
away
to
make
a
man
of
myself
if
he
can
put
jack
on
his
feet
again
he
will
feel
that
he
is
only
paying
back
a
small
part
of
his
obligation
to
you
all
to
say
nothing
of
debt
lord
i
ca
even
talk
about
that
now
it
too
big
for
me
ever
to
tackle
myself
but
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
how
we
both
feel
about
it
he
did
not
attempt
to
finish
but
with
a
final
strong
handclasp
he
was
gone
before
joyce
could
find
her
voice
for
more
than
a
faltering
for
a
little
while
after
he
left
she
sat
before
her
easel
gazing
vacantly
at
the
canvas
with
eyes
which
saw
nothing
she
could
not
settle
down
to
work
again
with
so
many
exciting
mental
pictures
rising
up
before
her
jack
undergoing
the
operation
at
home
the
awful
suspense
and
tension
of
that
time
of
waiting
until
they
could
know
the
result
and
then
jack
strong
and
well
and
swinging
along
with
the
vigorous
stride
she
remembered
so
well
or
would
it
be
she
shut
her
eyes
and
shuddered
putting
away
from
her
with
an
exclamation
of
horror
the
other
scene
that
persisted
in
presenting
itself
she
had
never
forgotten
the
tramp
of
feet
across
the
threshold
of
the
little
brown
house
in
plainsville
the
day
they
carried
her
father
away
presently
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
pushing
back
her
easel
she
slipped
off
her
apron
and
called
to
boyd
that
she
was
going
out
for
awhile
in
her
present
tremor
of
nervousness
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
stop
and
explain
she
felt
that
she
could
not
bear
to
listen
to
the
little
woman
platitudes
no
matter
how
sympathetic
they
might
be
it
was
not
till
she
was
on
the
car
out
to
central
park
that
she
remembered
she
had
not
told
phil
of
one
other
item
of
news
in
her
mother
letter
she
wondered
if
he
knew
that
gay
and
alex
shelby
were
engaged
the
reason
that
they
had
gone
to
bauer
was
to
announce
it
themselves
to
the
only
people
in
that
part
of
the
world
who
knew
and
loved
lloydsboro
valley
it
was
in
that
happy
valley
that
their
romance
had
begun
and
they
both
knew
that
ware
had
spent
her
girlhood
there
that
mary
regarded
it
as
her
promised
land
and
that
jack
although
his
visit
there
had
been
limited
to
one
day
had
seen
the
cabin
where
gay
and
her
knight
of
the
had
first
caught
sight
of
each
other
and
where
their
married
life
was
to
begin
it
was
several
hours
before
joyce
got
back
to
the
studio
the
long
and
the
brisk
walk
in
the
park
had
helped
her
to
regain
her
usual
outward
composure
but
she
was
far
from
being
as
calm
as
she
seemed
alternate
moods
of
hopefulness
and
foreboding
kept
her
swinging
like
a
pendulum
from
exhilaration
to
a
sickening
sense
of
fear
she
could
hardly
fix
her
mind
on
her
work
although
her
hands
moved
feverishly
before
starting
back
to
work
she
hunted
up
one
of
henrietta
railroad
and
fastened
it
to
a
corner
of
her
canvas
so
that
she
could
follow
the
course
of
the
travellers
at
intervals
she
glanced
from
the
clock
to
the
card
thinking
now
they
are
just
leaving
the
new
york
station
or
now
they
are
pulling
into
washington
later
she
found
the
time
when
they
would
be
going
aboard
the
new
orleans
sleeper
and
from
then
on
a
thousand
times
her
thoughts
ran
on
ahead
to
picture
their
reception
in
bauer
and
the
events
that
would
follow
there
in
quick
succession
her
waking
hours
were
filled
with
only
one
thought
till
phil
first
telegram
announced
their
arrival
then
she
scarcely
ate
or
slept
so
great
was
her
anxiety
as
she
waited
his
second
message
as
doctor
tremont
and
phil
pushed
through
the
crowds
at
the
new
york
station
hurrying
to
reach
the
train
steaming
on
the
track
phil
recalled
the
last
time
he
had
passed
through
it
was
in
march
of
the
previous
year
but
later
in
the
month
that
he
had
come
down
with
joyce
to
put
mary
and
betty
aboard
the
train
the
morning
after
they
had
heard
about
jack
accident
it
was
at
that
stand
that
he
bought
the
fruit
for
them
here
he
had
snatched
up
the
magazines
and
there
was
where
he
had
stood
while
the
train
pulled
out
waiting
for
the
last
glimpse
of
the
little
vicar
face
at
the
window
bravely
smiling
in
her
efforts
to
keep
inflexible
for
joyce
sake
the
scene
had
been
impressed
vividly
upon
his
memory
because
of
the
way
the
whole
affair
had
touched
his
sympathies
and
now
he
found
himself
after
a
year
recalling
things
that
at
the
time
he
had
barely
noticed
it
was
like
taking
a
second
look
at
a
snapshot
picture
and
finding
details
in
the
background
to
which
he
had
paid
no
attention
when
first
focussing
the
camera
there
was
that
wistful
look
in
betty
brown
eyes
for
instance
they
had
been
almost
as
full
of
trouble
as
mary
their
appealing
sadness
came
back
to
him
now
quite
as
forcibly
as
tearful
smile
he
remembered
the
protecting
way
she
had
put
her
arm
around
her
little
pupil
they
had
been
such
good
comrades
all
through
the
vacation
pleasures
which
they
had
shared
that
christmas
and
easter
he
remembered
now
how
far
back
betty
friendship
with
joyce
dated
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
betty
of
all
people
would
be
most
interested
in
what
was
about
to
occur
in
the
ware
family
whatever
followed
the
operation
whether
it
were
grief
or
joy
she
would
share
with
them
doctor
tremont
had
some
business
to
attend
to
which
would
keep
him
busy
during
the
few
hours
they
were
obliged
to
stop
over
in
washington
and
after
a
few
moments
deliberation
phil
decided
to
go
out
to
warwick
hall
while
he
waited
instead
of
spending
his
time
looking
up
an
old
acquaintance
as
he
had
intended
doing
there
was
another
reason
for
calling
on
betty
which
he
did
not
acknowledge
to
himself
as
a
reason
but
it
carried
weight
in
helping
him
to
make
a
decision
that
was
the
knowledge
that
she
would
have
the
latest
news
of
lloyd
sherman
he
had
had
six
months
in
which
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
the
little
unset
turquoise
he
had
once
given
her
could
never
stand
for
anything
more
between
them
than
the
friendship
stone
he
had
been
so
determined
to
make
it
more
that
his
whole
world
seemed
jolted
out
of
its
orbit
when
he
heard
of
her
engagement
to
rob
moore
he
could
not
talk
of
it
at
first
lately
however
he
had
come
to
take
a
more
philosophical
view
of
the
situation
several
hours
later
when
phil
found
himself
in
front
of
warwick
hall
the
great
building
and
beautifully
kept
grounds
seemed
as
familiar
as
if
he
had
visited
it
before
the
lloydsboro
valley
girls
had
sung
its
praises
ever
since
he
had
known
them
lloyd
herself
had
talked
much
of
it
in
the
days
when
every
subject
she
mentioned
was
interesting
simply
because
she
chose
to
talk
about
it
mary
ware
had
pictured
it
to
him
as
a
veritable
paradise
and
he
had
been
pressed
to
admire
so
many
photographs
of
it
on
so
many
occasions
that
it
was
no
wonder
it
had
a
familiar
look
every
way
he
turned
he
would
have
been
highly
amused
could
he
have
known
what
a
sensation
he
was
creating
in
the
school
as
he
stood
on
the
highest
terrace
looking
down
the
flight
of
stately
marble
steps
that
led
to
the
river
in
the
first
place
the
sight
of
such
an
unusually
attractive
man
young
handsome
and
with
an
air
of
distinction
was
a
rarity
in
those
parts
that
he
should
loiter
down
the
walk
instead
of
striding
straight
up
to
the
massive
portal
aroused
the
curiosity
of
every
girl
who
happened
to
be
near
a
window
and
why
he
should
pluck
a
leaf
from
the
abbotsford
ivy
overhanging
the
pergola
and
then
walk
along
the
hedge
of
the
wonderful
old
garden
until
he
could
lean
over
and
read
the
motto
on
the
ancient
was
more
than
any
of
them
could
fathom
there
was
a
flutter
among
those
who
had
seen
him
when
presently
the
great
knocker
echoing
through
the
hall
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
enter
the
pompous
butler
opened
the
door
and
for
the
second
time
in
his
history
nearly
fell
backward
for
the
dignified
young
stranger
who
stood
there
with
the
easy
grace
of
at
least
a
viscount
called
out
as
if
he
had
known
him
always
oh
it
hawkins
when
phil
raised
his
hand
to
the
knocker
he
was
smiling
over
account
of
her
first
entrance
through
that
door
he
had
teased
her
unmercifully
when
he
heard
of
her
rehearsals
for
the
purpose
of
impressing
the
butler
and
when
the
man
instantly
appeared
just
as
mary
had
pictured
him
he
was
so
much
like
a
stiff
old
portrait
bowing
from
the
frame
of
the
doorway
that
the
exclamation
slipped
from
phil
in
surprise
then
he
smiled
again
thinking
how
inadvertently
he
had
copied
mary
at
first
glance
hawkins
thought
he
must
be
one
of
madam
relatives
from
england
and
bowed
again
obsequiously
this
time
but
the
card
laid
on
his
silver
tray
was
not
for
madam
it
was
for
miss
elizabeth
lewis
the
youngest
and
most
popular
teacher
in
the
hall
it
was
after
recitation
hours
and
betty
was
not
in
her
room
but
she
came
in
presently
from
a
walk
looking
as
girlish
and
rosy
as
the
little
freshman
who
had
been
her
companion
the
march
winds
had
given
her
color
and
blown
her
brown
hair
about
her
face
in
soft
little
curls
phil
could
see
her
through
the
curtained
arch
as
she
came
into
the
hall
and
took
the
card
hawkins
presented
on
his
tray
her
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
and
she
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
both
of
which
items
hawkins
noticed
when
she
hurried
into
the
he
cast
a
look
of
discreet
curiosity
after
her
then
he
turned
away
with
a
wise
wag
of
the
head
of
course
one
knew
what
to
expect
when
the
young
stranger
called
her
by
her
first
name
in
such
a
joyful
tone
as
that
and
she
responded
cordially
that
it
was
such
a
lovely
surprise
to
see
the
best
man
all
the
wedding
party
had
called
phil
the
best
man
ever
since
mary
had
emphasized
the
name
by
her
comically
reverent
use
of
it
and
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
the
next
remark
should
be
about
her
phil
thought
to
surprise
betty
by
saying
casually
i
just
stopped
by
to
ask
if
you
want
to
send
any
message
to
mary
ware
i
on
my
own
way
to
bauer
now
but
he
was
the
one
to
be
surprised
for
her
face
paled
and
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
tense
with
suppressed
excitement
oh
is
your
father
going
too
has
he
really
consented
to
attempt
the
operation
then
in
answer
to
his
exclamation
of
astonishment
that
she
should
know
anything
about
it
she
explained
while
the
color
returned
in
a
rush
she
had
had
a
note
from
jack
that
morning
just
a
scribbled
line
telling
what
alex
shelby
had
written
to
doctor
tremont
and
what
they
hoped
would
be
the
answer
he
has
told
the
family
yet
she
explained
seeing
from
phil
face
that
he
thought
it
queer
she
should
know
of
it
he
did
want
them
to
suffer
the
cruel
disappointment
it
would
be
should
they
discover
they
had
been
cherishing
a
false
hope
but
he
just
to
tell
somebody
and
he
knew
i
understand
how
much
recovery
would
mean
to
him
for
he
used
to
write
me
so
fully
of
his
plans
and
ambitions
before
he
was
hurt
she
closed
her
hands
so
tightly
that
the
pink
nails
pressed
into
the
tender
palms
oh
i
alex
has
been
mistaken
she
exclaimed
i
ca
think
of
anything
so
cruel
as
to
hold
out
the
heaven
of
such
a
hope
to
him
only
to
have
it
dashed
away
daddy
says
there
is
one
chance
answered
phil
and
he
is
going
to
take
it
then
with
a
sudden
understanding
of
the
situation
as
he
watched
her
face
he
began
to
comfort
her
with
the
same
words
he
had
spoken
to
joyce
daddy
can
come
as
near
to
working
miracles
as
any
man
living
and
you
just
remember
this
little
girl
he
going
to
work
one
this
time
if
mortal
man
can
do
it
the
ring
of
certainty
in
his
voice
made
her
look
up
at
him
with
a
smile
that
was
like
an
april
day
such
joy
shone
through
the
brown
eyes
which
a
moment
before
had
been
misty
with
tears
she
did
not
know
how
much
she
had
revealed
but
as
she
turned
away
phil
said
to
himself
so
the
way
the
land
lies
i
must
give
daddy
a
hint
of
how
much
is
at
stake
if
he
saves
jack
it
wo
be
for
the
ware
family
alone
betty
had
been
called
aside
a
moment
to
speak
to
a
visiting
parent
and
when
she
came
back
to
phil
had
fully
recovered
her
composure
come
on
she
said
gaily
there
are
a
few
things
i
must
show
you
it
will
never
do
for
anybody
to
confess
to
mary
ware
that
he
has
been
to
warwick
hall
and
missed
seeing
the
things
that
she
particularly
adores
it
was
a
short
pilgrimage
she
led
him
on
to
meet
madam
chartley
first
then
to
see
the
great
window
where
the
motto
of
edryn
i
keep
tryste
flaunted
itself
in
letters
of
light
above
the
ruby
heart
and
the
mailed
hand
clasping
the
spear
then
outdoors
they
went
past
the
peacocks
on
the
terraces
down
the
marble
steps
to
the
river
where
pretty
girls
were
walking
arm
in
arm
and
phil
was
conscious
of
many
curious
glances
cast
in
his
direction
then
they
strolled
through
the
garden
where
the
crocuses
and
early
march
flowers
were
making
a
brave
showing
and
out
towards
the
golf
links
a
little
way
betty
cheeks
were
almost
as
red
as
the
bright
tam
cap
she
wore
and
her
eyes
shone
with
a
happy
tender
light
as
she
talked
of
mary
and
what
the
school
had
meant
to
her
the
pilgrimage
like
the
bundle
of
letters
which
joyce
had
read
was
eloquent
with
suggestions
of
mary
at
every
turn
he
understood
now
as
he
had
not
before
how
much
she
had
renounced
when
she
left
without
finishing
the
year
he
began
to
appreciate
the
greatness
of
her
sacrifice
and
guided
by
betty
at
his
elbow
he
began
to
perceive
what
an
influence
such
a
place
with
its
ideals
and
its
refined
fashion
of
living
might
exert
on
a
girl
like
mary
ware
there
was
not
much
opportunity
to
lead
the
conversation
towards
lloyd
with
betty
constantly
breaking
off
to
say
oh
do
forget
to
mention
this
to
mary
or
tell
her
you
saw
this
and
that
he
learned
very
little
about
her
save
that
she
was
well
and
happy
betty
had
always
known
she
said
that
rob
was
the
one
written
in
the
stars
for
the
princess
winsome
they
knew
each
other
so
thoroughly
and
had
such
a
happy
childhood
in
common
and
in
her
opinion
they
had
always
been
meant
for
each
other
from
the
beginning
it
was
growing
late
when
they
came
back
to
the
front
door
but
betty
insisted
on
his
coming
in
for
a
moment
for
a
cup
of
tea
served
from
an
ancestral
teacup
she
insisted
so
that
you
can
brag
to
mary
of
it
while
they
waited
for
it
to
be
brought
betty
hastily
summoned
several
of
the
girls
whom
she
wanted
him
to
meet
you
never
remember
their
names
she
said
laughingly
and
mary
will
make
your
life
a
burden
with
questions
if
you
ca
answer
give
me
a
pencil
and
i
scribble
them
down
for
you
elise
walton
remember
of
course
for
she
was
the
pretty
child
with
the
long
dark
curls
whom
you
used
to
meet
so
many
times
at
the
beeches
the
summer
eugenia
was
married
you
quite
fall
in
love
with
her
i
am
sure
for
she
is
getting
prettier
every
day
and
you
not
need
any
memorandum
to
keep
her
in
mind
when
you
once
heard
her
talk
miggs
will
be
the
little
dumpling
of
a
girl
and
dorene
derwent
the
one
who
giggles
so
gurglingly
cornie
dean
you
remember
for
the
elaborate
way
she
does
her
hair
and
the
coy
way
she
has
of
casting
melting
that
a
habit
she
has
acquired
just
in
this
last
year
so
you
might
mention
it
to
mary
she
be
immensely
interested
in
hearing
it
see
i
have
made
marginal
notes
for
each
one
if
you
can
understand
my
abbreviations
as
she
handed
him
the
slip
of
paper
the
girls
came
in
all
pleased
to
meet
such
a
fascinating
looking
man
as
described
him
afterward
and
all
overjoyed
to
find
that
he
would
be
the
bearer
of
messages
to
mary
ware
they
sent
so
many
that
he
laughingly
disclaimed
all
responsibility
in
case
he
should
get
them
mixed
in
transit
he
had
an
odd
feeling
that
he
was
on
exhibition
to
these
girls
as
mary
friend
and
that
he
must
do
her
credit
the
few
moments
he
stayed
with
them
he
used
to
such
advantage
that
he
was
straightway
written
down
in
their
opinion
as
the
most
fascinating
man
they
had
ever
met
when
he
took
his
leave
it
was
with
a
flattering
regret
that
made
each
girl
feel
that
she
was
the
one
who
inspired
it
and
they
went
back
to
their
rooms
to
compare
notes
and
to
rave
over
him
as
dorene
expressed
it
for
days
the
twilight
was
falling
when
he
started
back
to
the
station
betty
walked
part
of
the
way
with
him
only
once
they
referred
to
jack
again
and
that
was
not
till
they
reached
the
bend
in
the
driveway
where
betty
turned
back
she
put
out
her
hand
with
wishes
for
a
safe
journey
and
he
held
it
an
instant
to
say
i
sure
it
all
going
to
end
happily
and
you
shall
have
the
first
telegram
chapter
xii
in
time
the
time
of
had
come
no
matter
where
else
in
texas
the
lupin
may
grow
one
thing
is
certain
there
is
enough
of
it
in
the
meadows
around
bauer
nearly
every
spring
to
justify
its
choice
as
the
state
flower
this
particular
march
acres
and
acres
of
it
blue
as
the
mediterranean
stretched
away
on
either
side
of
the
viewed
from
a
distance
when
the
wind
blowing
across
it
made
waves
of
bloom
it
almost
seemed
as
if
a
wide
blue
sea
were
rolling
in
across
the
land
from
his
bed
near
the
window
jack
ware
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
one
of
these
meadows
where
the
cattle
stood
buried
up
to
their
bodies
in
the
fragrant
blossoms
now
and
then
the
breeze
fluttering
his
curtains
brought
the
odor
to
him
almost
as
heavy
and
sweet
as
the
smell
of
locusts
he
watched
the
picture
with
languid
eyes
which
closed
weakly
at
intervals
they
were
shut
when
mary
tiptoed
into
the
room
to
see
if
there
was
anything
she
could
do
for
his
comfort
before
starting
out
on
her
usual
afternoon
excursion
with
her
pupils
but
they
opened
with
an
expression
of
greater
interest
than
they
had
held
for
some
days
as
he
saw
her
standing
there
in
a
freshly
laundered
gingham
it
was
so
blue
and
white
that
she
suggested
a
blooming
herself
hullo
finnigan
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
his
pleasantry
agin
gone
agin
are
you
which
way
this
time
touched
almost
to
tears
by
this
evidence
of
returning
interest
mary
explained
eagerly
that
they
were
still
studying
about
bees
she
had
found
a
in
the
herdt
pasture
and
the
lupin
was
all
with
specimens
to
illustrate
the
lesson
that
was
for
the
wisdom
part
of
it
for
the
strength
there
were
some
new
exercises
in
climbing
and
hanging
from
a
low
limb
the
practical
application
of
their
courtesy
lesson
would
be
the
gathering
of
a
great
basketful
of
for
the
ladies
of
the
guild
who
wanted
to
decorate
the
parish
house
with
them
for
an
entertainment
to
be
given
there
oh
they
making
long
strides
she
assured
him
mallory
told
me
that
the
time
it
rained
so
hard
last
week
and
i
could
get
across
the
at
the
ford
to
give
them
their
usual
lesson
brud
sat
down
at
bedtime
and
howled
because
he
said
he
have
to
that
day
lost
the
sun
was
down
and
he
had
worvey
action
done
it
took
the
combined
wits
of
the
family
to
think
of
some
worthy
action
he
could
do
at
that
late
hour
and
he
finally
went
to
bed
happy
so
you
see
my
labor
has
been
all
in
vain
there
was
a
faint
gleam
of
amusement
in
jack
eyes
but
seeing
that
she
was
about
to
leave
him
he
turned
the
subject
by
motioning
toward
the
table
beside
his
bed
where
elsie
tremont
wedding
invitations
lay
mary
he
said
slowly
would
you
be
surprised
if
phil
were
to
come
by
bauer
on
his
way
to
california
to
her
vehement
avowal
that
such
a
happening
would
certainly
surprise
her
out
of
a
year
growth
at
least
he
answered
well
i
am
a
good
deal
more
than
looking
for
him
feel
it
in
my
bones
that
he
is
coming
and
coming
very
soon
oh
jack
she
cried
in
distress
do
look
for
him
do
set
your
heart
on
seeing
him
i
could
bear
for
you
to
be
disappointed
do
you
worry
about
that
he
answered
soothingly
you
run
along
and
pick
your
and
if
phil
happen
to
come
walking
down
the
road
towards
you
one
of
these
days
remember
the
feeling
in
my
bones
warned
you
the
poor
old
things
have
been
so
full
of
aches
and
pains
that
you
might
allow
them
one
pleasant
sensation
at
least
but
jack
she
began
again
a
wrinkle
of
distress
deepening
between
her
eyes
if
he
should
come
you
be
so
awfully
disappointed
jack
thin
hand
waved
both
her
and
her
objections
aside
hike
along
he
insisted
cheerfully
i
merely
said
considerably
worried
by
what
she
thought
was
a
groundless
hope
of
jack
mary
started
out
of
the
gate
his
suggestion
seemed
to
change
the
entire
landscape
and
instead
of
seeing
it
as
it
had
grown
to
look
to
her
accustomed
eyes
she
saw
it
as
she
imagined
it
would
appear
to
phil
the
cottage
she
was
leaving
behind
her
the
wide
blue
lupin
meadows
ahead
the
white
of
the
wild
plum
blossoms
mingled
with
the
glowing
branches
of
the
trees
in
every
lane
and
stretch
of
woodland
with
her
old
childish
propensity
for
unabated
she
made
pictures
for
herself
as
she
walked
along
towards
the
suppose
he
really
would
come
and
she
by
some
intuition
of
his
approach
could
divine
the
day
and
hour
she
would
like
to
be
all
in
white
when
he
met
her
emerging
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
with
her
arms
heaped
up
with
snowy
masses
of
wild
plum
blossoms
and
a
spray
of
in
her
hair
or
maybe
it
would
be
more
picturesque
for
her
to
be
standing
in
the
boat
poling
slowly
towards
the
landing
a
cargo
of
wild
flowers
at
her
feet
like
a
picture
of
the
spirit
of
spring
here
she
broke
off
from
her
musings
saying
half
aloud
but
as
sure
as
i
posed
to
look
like
a
spring
goddess
i
be
looking
like
a
young
goose
it
does
pay
for
me
to
plan
impressive
entrances
and
meetings
they
always
turn
out
with
my
looking
perfectly
ridiculous
she
had
reached
the
first
turn
in
the
road
by
this
time
and
stooping
to
tie
her
shoe
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
her
hands
were
empty
she
had
started
off
without
the
and
the
magnifying
glass
which
she
always
carried
on
these
trips
in
addition
she
had
intended
to
bring
a
large
in
which
to
put
the
flowers
the
basket
with
the
clock
and
glass
inside
was
in
her
hand
before
she
started
she
remembered
she
had
set
it
down
for
a
moment
on
the
front
step
while
she
went
back
into
jack
room
and
it
was
what
he
said
about
phil
coming
that
made
her
go
off
without
it
there
was
no
time
to
lose
so
she
started
back
running
all
the
way
snatching
up
the
basket
from
the
step
where
she
found
it
still
undisturbed
she
was
starting
off
again
when
a
little
cry
stopped
her
it
was
like
the
softest
notes
of
a
that
provoking
little
wildcat
is
out
of
her
cage
again
she
exclaimed
stopping
to
look
all
around
here
matilda
kitty
kitty
where
are
you
in
response
to
her
call
what
seemed
to
be
the
gentlest
of
came
bounding
through
the
grass
thinking
it
would
be
less
trouble
to
take
it
along
than
to
carry
it
back
to
its
cage
in
the
woodshed
when
she
was
in
such
a
great
hurry
mary
caught
it
up
in
her
arms
and
once
more
started
down
the
road
one
hand
slipped
through
the
handle
of
the
basket
it
snuggled
down
against
her
shoulder
purring
loudly
you
ridiculous
little
atom
laughed
mary
i
wonder
what
the
girls
at
warwick
hall
would
say
if
they
could
see
me
going
along
carrying
a
live
that
will
be
something
wild
and
texasy
for
me
to
put
in
my
next
letters
i
need
say
that
it
weighs
only
twenty
ounces
and
that
if
it
was
for
its
bow
legs
and
funny
little
bobbed
tail
and
spotted
stomach
one
would
think
it
was
just
a
tame
ordinary
domestic
pussy
but
you
be
savage
enough
by
and
bye
wo
you
when
the
tassels
grow
on
your
and
your
whiskers
spread
out
wide
and
your
spots
get
big
and
tigery
two
soft
paws
reached
up
to
tap
her
face
and
she
gave
the
furry
ball
in
her
arms
an
affectionate
squeeze
she
had
never
cared
especially
for
kittens
but
this
little
wild
one
with
its
coquettish
ways
had
wonderfully
ingratiated
itself
into
her
affections
in
the
week
she
had
owned
it
barnaby
had
brought
it
in
from
the
ranch
cousin
sammy
had
found
eight
of
them
in
the
woods
after
pedro
had
killed
the
old
mother
cat
caught
in
the
act
of
carrying
off
one
of
the
turkeys
this
was
the
only
one
that
lived
barnaby
could
not
keep
it
because
tiny
as
it
was
it
toddled
around
after
the
chickens
and
put
even
the
big
plymouth
rock
hens
to
flight
so
she
brought
it
in
to
mary
and
mary
feeling
particularly
forlorn
that
day
welcomed
the
little
orphan
because
its
lonely
state
gave
them
a
bond
in
common
the
day
it
came
happened
to
be
her
eighteenth
birthday
with
nothing
to
mark
it
as
a
gala
occasion
except
a
handkerchief
from
her
mother
and
a
string
of
trout
from
norman
he
had
gone
out
before
daylight
to
catch
them
for
her
breakfast
joyce
present
did
not
arrive
until
the
next
day
and
the
letter
from
warwick
hall
was
nearly
a
week
late
not
until
after
the
sorority
was
seated
at
its
annual
patrick
day
dinner
did
they
recall
the
double
celebration
they
had
had
the
year
before
the
letter
was
written
then
and
there
passing
around
the
table
with
the
bonbons
that
each
one
present
might
add
a
birthday
greeting
then
dorene
to
whom
it
was
entrusted
forgot
to
post
it
for
several
days
it
was
a
joy
when
it
did
come
but
the
anniversary
itself
before
the
letter
reached
her
was
a
disappointing
day
she
had
always
looked
forward
to
her
eighteenth
birthday
as
being
one
of
the
most
important
milestones
of
her
life
not
so
important
of
course
as
one
graduation
or
début
or
wedding
but
still
a
day
that
should
be
made
memorable
by
something
unusually
nice
years
ago
jack
had
promised
her
a
watch
on
her
eighteenth
birthday
a
little
chatelaine
watch
with
a
case
like
the
one
the
old
colonel
had
given
to
lloyd
but
when
the
time
came
jack
did
not
even
know
that
it
was
her
birthday
he
never
looked
at
the
calendar
since
their
weary
monotonous
days
had
grown
to
be
all
alike
she
did
not
show
him
the
handkerchief
or
tell
him
that
the
delicious
fish
which
they
had
for
breakfast
was
in
honor
of
any
especial
occasion
in
no
way
did
she
refer
to
its
being
the
seventeenth
of
march
she
ironed
all
morning
and
took
the
children
out
in
the
afternoon
as
usual
and
nothing
made
the
day
different
from
an
ordinary
one
only
that
she
felt
very
old
and
grown
up
and
thought
now
and
then
a
little
pityingly
of
her
early
expectations
and
the
way
they
had
turned
out
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
she
was
sorry
for
herself
till
barnaby
came
in
with
the
baby
wildcat
which
she
jokingly
offered
as
a
patrick
day
greeting
mary
immediately
named
it
matilda
for
barnaby
and
for
the
civilizing
effect
such
a
tame
gentle
sort
of
name
ought
to
have
on
a
wild
creature
in
watching
it
and
laughing
over
its
playful
antics
she
forgot
to
feel
and
sorry
for
herself
as
long
as
someone
could
keep
an
eye
on
it
to
prevent
its
straying
away
after
any
animal
that
passed
the
house
it
could
be
allowed
the
liberty
of
the
place
but
whenever
mary
went
off
for
a
long
time
it
had
to
be
fastened
in
its
cage
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
taken
it
with
her
for
an
afternoon
outing
and
as
she
hurried
down
the
road
with
it
in
her
arms
the
knowledge
of
what
she
was
carrying
gave
her
the
first
feeling
of
adventure
that
she
had
had
since
coming
to
texas
it
all
been
as
tame
as
an
old
tabby
and
a
teapot
she
thought
she
had
pictured
texas
as
a
land
of
cowboys
and
and
thrilling
frontier
experiences
she
had
found
only
the
commonplace
and
conventional
so
that
there
was
a
source
of
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
at
last
she
had
captured
something
untamed
and
savage
as
she
reached
the
a
party
on
horseback
came
down
the
opposite
bank
to
cross
the
ford
she
recognized
the
young
fellow
in
the
lead
as
a
boy
from
the
east
who
had
been
staying
at
the
williams
house
several
months
evidently
he
also
had
expected
to
find
texas
a
land
of
adventure
soon
after
his
arrival
he
appeared
in
the
quiet
streets
of
bauer
attired
like
the
cowboy
of
a
wild
west
show
that
he
was
a
tenderfoot
was
amusingly
apparent
to
the
natives
everything
proclaimed
it
from
his
awkward
seat
in
his
creaking
new
saddle
to
the
new
rope
coiled
around
the
horn
of
it
he
could
have
no
more
use
for
a
lariat
than
for
a
tomahawk
but
he
never
rode
without
it
he
had
his
picture
taken
in
full
paraphernalia
from
his
spurs
to
the
rattlesnake
skin
band
on
his
rakish
sombrero
to
send
back
home
to
show
what
a
sport
he
had
become
and
his
cup
of
satisfaction
brimmed
over
when
a
still
more
recent
tenderfoot
took
a
snapshot
of
him
evidently
considering
him
the
real
thing
he
had
three
eastern
girls
with
him
this
morning
whom
he
was
trying
to
impress
with
stories
of
his
recklessness
and
prowess
and
of
the
dangers
one
daily
encountered
in
a
new
country
he
had
met
norman
and
he
knew
mary
by
sight
and
had
heard
of
her
odd
pet
as
they
approached
her
he
said
in
a
tone
which
she
could
not
fail
to
hear
although
he
lowered
his
voice
there
mighty
little
out
here
that
is
tame
lots
of
people
keep
foxes
running
around
their
premises
instead
of
and
when
they
can
get
a
wildcat
they
always
prefer
them
to
tame
mousers
now
dexter
stop
stuffing
us
one
of
the
girls
exclaimed
i
believe
a
word
of
it
it
the
truth
he
insisted
that
very
young
lady
over
yonder
on
the
could
tell
you
so
that
is
a
kitten
she
is
carrying
it
is
a
young
wildcat
the
next
instant
the
girl
was
splashing
through
the
water
across
to
mary
calling
excuse
me
but
that
a
wildcat
i
ca
believe
it
mary
had
heard
the
conversation
and
her
face
dimpled
with
amusement
as
she
held
matilda
up
to
view
saying
certainly
see
how
beautifully
she
is
marked
she
pointed
out
the
various
signs
which
proved
her
claim
the
girl
gave
a
little
shriek
for
mercy
sakes
she
exclaimed
suppose
it
should
get
loose
what
a
dreadful
country
are
you
afraid
assured
that
mary
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
she
dashed
up
the
bank
after
her
laughing
escort
who
thereafter
had
no
trouble
in
convincing
her
that
his
most
daring
tales
were
true
since
matilda
had
proved
the
truth
of
his
first
one
mary
looked
after
them
almost
enviously
when
she
first
came
to
bauer
she
had
had
faint
hopes
of
sometime
being
able
to
join
a
riding
party
like
that
she
had
seen
girls
going
by
often
from
the
hotel
and
had
told
herself
that
before
the
winter
was
over
she
intended
to
find
some
way
to
earn
enough
to
hire
a
horse
one
afternoon
of
every
week
and
that
time
when
she
visited
gay
and
roberta
talked
of
saddles
while
she
combed
mary
hair
roberta
had
said
that
she
would
ride
up
to
bauer
sometime
after
christmas
all
her
crowd
would
go
and
they
would
stay
several
days
at
the
williams
house
and
mary
was
to
show
them
the
country
gay
had
promised
several
visits
and
mary
had
looked
forward
to
them
more
eagerly
than
she
knew
till
word
came
soon
after
new
year
that
the
bauer
trips
would
have
to
be
postponed
indefinitely
roberta
had
gone
to
the
coast
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
and
gay
expected
to
spend
several
months
with
her
sister
lucy
jameson
harcourt
in
florida
it
seemed
to
mary
that
there
had
been
disappointment
for
her
in
her
texas
winter
every
way
she
turned
true
gay
was
home
now
and
they
had
had
two
pleasant
days
with
her
once
when
she
and
alex
shelby
came
up
to
announce
their
engagement
and
cheered
jack
up
so
wonderfully
but
gay
was
interested
in
horseback
riding
with
the
crowd
any
longer
besides
the
ware
fortunes
had
taken
such
a
turn
that
the
money
she
had
succeeded
in
earning
had
to
go
for
more
necessary
things
than
saddles
and
and
a
pretty
habit
as
mary
glanced
after
the
departing
cavalcade
once
more
the
sight
of
them
suggested
a
new
picture
that
appealed
to
her
as
an
interesting
way
to
meet
phil
in
case
he
should
come
it
would
be
so
picturesque
to
be
galloping
down
the
road
on
a
mettlesome
black
horse
in
a
pretty
white
riding
habit
like
those
girls
were
wearing
white
with
a
scarlet
and
a
soft
fold
of
scarlet
silk
around
the
crown
of
her
white
hat
phil
had
been
such
a
dashing
horseman
himself
and
had
owned
such
a
beautiful
animal
when
they
were
out
on
the
desert
that
maybe
he
would
be
more
interested
in
an
approach
made
that
way
than
one
in
a
boat
with
a
cargo
of
wild
flowers
she
walked
along
slowly
considering
the
question
till
brud
and
sister
hailed
her
meanwhile
jack
was
saying
to
his
mother
that
it
would
have
been
fair
to
the
kid
to
let
her
get
away
without
some
inkling
of
the
truth
she
have
been
terribly
upset
if
i
have
told
her
that
they
are
due
here
this
afternoon
and
she
have
been
equally
upset
if
they
had
walked
in
on
her
without
any
warning
but
the
hint
i
gave
her
will
start
her
to
thinking
about
them
so
she
will
not
be
altogether
surprised
when
she
sees
them
he
had
waited
until
mary
left
the
house
before
breaking
the
news
to
his
mother
that
he
expected
alex
shelby
to
come
sometime
during
the
afternoon
bringing
doctor
tremont
and
phil
but
even
then
he
did
not
mention
the
faint
hope
which
had
buoyed
him
up
night
and
day
since
alex
first
visit
he
had
faith
in
the
young
physician
ability
but
not
until
the
older
one
confirmed
his
opinion
would
he
allow
himself
to
share
that
hope
with
any
one
else
lest
it
prove
without
foundation
with
his
eyes
on
the
clock
he
lay
counting
the
minutes
until
their
arrival
he
was
deliberately
forcing
himself
to
be
calm
to
take
slow
even
breaths
to
think
of
everything
under
the
sun
save
the
one
thing
which
set
his
pulses
to
beating
wildly
and
sent
a
thrill
like
fire
tingling
through
him
he
lay
there
like
a
prisoner
in
his
dungeon
who
hears
footsteps
and
new
voices
approaching
they
might
mean
that
deliverance
is
at
hand
or
they
might
pass
on
leaving
him
to
the
blackness
and
despair
of
his
dungeon
for
the
rest
of
his
life
in
a
like
agony
of
apprehension
he
watched
the
pendulum
swing
back
and
forth
and
listened
to
the
slow
tick
tock
till
his
suspense
grew
almost
unendurable
one
hand
clasped
and
unclasped
a
corner
of
the
counterpane
in
a
paroxysm
of
nervousness
he
lay
with
his
face
turned
away
from
his
mother
and
she
busy
with
her
endless
sewing
over
by
the
side
window
did
not
guess
what
great
effort
he
was
making
to
retain
his
outward
composure
she
saw
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
clock
however
when
she
rose
to
get
a
spool
that
had
rolled
away
and
feeling
his
restrained
restlessness
she
tried
to
think
of
something
to
talk
about
which
would
make
him
forget
how
slowly
time
was
passing
subjects
of
that
kind
are
rare
when
two
people
have
been
constantly
shut
in
together
for
a
year
and
while
she
considered
a
long
silence
fell
between
them
it
was
broken
by
a
demand
almost
querulous
from
jack
the
same
cry
that
had
aroused
her
in
the
night
when
he
was
a
little
boy
suddenly
awakening
from
a
scary
dream
to
me
mother
it
had
been
years
since
she
had
heard
that
cry
and
the
long
form
stretched
out
under
the
white
covers
bore
small
resemblance
to
the
little
one
that
had
summoned
her
then
but
she
answered
in
the
same
soothing
way
all
right
little
son
what
shall
i
sing
she
smiled
as
the
same
tremulous
answer
came
now
as
it
had
then
why
sing
song
of
course
she
did
not
rise
as
had
been
her
custom
to
go
to
his
bedside
and
hold
his
hand
while
she
lulled
him
back
to
sleep
with
her
low
humming
and
the
blessed
consciousness
of
her
nearness
he
was
a
grown
man
now
and
it
was
broad
daylight
but
instinctively
she
felt
his
need
was
greater
than
it
had
ever
been
and
her
voice
took
on
its
tenderest
soothing
quality
as
she
began
to
croon
the
old
hymn
that
had
always
been
his
chosen
lullaby
when
he
was
tucked
to
sleep
in
a
little
crib
bed
pilgrims
of
the
night
she
sang
hark
my
soul
angelic
songs
are
swelling
earth
green
fields
and
ocean
shore
glancing
across
she
saw
his
drawn
face
relax
a
trifle
and
he
snuggled
his
thin
cheek
contentedly
against
the
pillow
high
and
sweet
her
voice
rose
tremulously
of
light
singing
to
welcome
the
pilgrims
of
the
night
the
song
had
many
associations
for
them
both
what
he
was
thinking
about
she
could
not
guess
but
when
she
began
the
third
verse
far
away
like
bells
at
evening
pealing
her
own
thoughts
were
back
in
that
time
when
she
rocked
in
her
arms
the
dearest
little
son
that
ever
cuddled
against
a
mother
shoulder
she
was
recalling
time
after
time
when
she
had
held
him
so
telling
him
stories
listening
to
his
funny
little
questions
and
baby
confidences
and
kissing
the
dimpled
fingers
clasped
in
her
own
when
he
knelt
to
lisp
his
evening
prayer
he
had
always
been
a
comfort
to
her
even
in
the
boisterous
outbreaking
days
that
are
the
most
trying
in
a
boy
time
there
had
never
been
a
noisier
boy
or
one
who
threw
himself
into
his
play
with
more
headlong
vigor
but
in
a
flash
scene
after
scene
passed
through
her
mind
showing
him
both
at
work
and
play
as
she
had
prayed
he
might
be
strong
and
manly
and
clean
and
absolutely
fearless
either
of
fists
or
opinions
then
she
thought
of
his
touching
consideration
of
her
when
he
tried
to
take
father
place
behind
the
plow
he
had
been
a
tower
of
strength
to
her
from
that
day
on
what
a
future
she
had
dreamed
for
him
and
now
in
the
high
tide
of
his
young
manhood
when
he
should
have
years
of
conquest
and
achievement
ahead
of
him
here
he
was
a
helpless
cripple
rest
comes
at
last
though
life
be
long
and
dreary
the
day
must
dawn
and
darksome
night
be
passed
her
voice
faltered
almost
to
breaking
now
as
she
sang
on
rebelling
at
the
thought
that
his
life
which
promised
so
fair
should
have
been
made
long
and
dreary
changed
so
hopelessly
and
so
suddenly
into
darksome
night
it
seemed
so
cruel
she
thought
with
a
tightening
of
the
throat
which
made
it
almost
impossible
to
finish
the
song
but
supposing
from
the
peaceful
expression
of
jack
face
that
he
was
falling
asleep
she
sang
bravely
on
to
the
end
although
the
tears
were
dropping
down
on
the
seam
in
her
now
idle
hands
angels
sing
on
your
faithful
watches
keeping
sing
us
sweet
fragments
of
the
song
above
till
morning
joy
shall
end
the
night
of
weeping
and
life
long
shadows
break
in
cloudless
love
angels
of
jesus
angels
of
light
singing
to
welcome
the
pilgrims
of
the
night
looking
across
as
the
last
note
died
away
she
thought
he
was
asleep
and
rose
to
draw
down
the
but
as
she
tiptoed
past
him
he
opened
his
eyes
and
held
out
his
hand
to
draw
her
to
him
little
mother
he
said
with
a
wistful
smile
that
made
her
bend
hastily
over
him
and
kiss
his
forehead
to
hide
the
trembling
of
her
lips
like
you
to
know
in
case
anything
should
happen
sooner
than
we
expect
that
that
the
way
i
think
of
death
it
a
going
out
into
the
dark
but
it
only
going
as
a
of
the
night
i
do
mind
it
it
not
be
lonesome
they
be
singing
to
welcome
me
in
answer
to
her
cry
oh
jack
do
he
drew
her
cheek
down
against
his
and
as
he
felt
it
wet
with
tears
he
said
lightly
why
mother
mine
that
nothing
to
cry
about
i
always
looked
forward
in
a
way
to
that
ever
since
i
can
remember
that
song
always
brings
up
the
most
comforting
picture
to
me
a
procession
of
friendly
white
angels
coming
down
the
dark
road
to
meet
a
frightened
little
boy
and
lead
him
home
she
held
him
close
a
moment
not
finding
words
wherewith
to
answer
him
but
feeling
that
he
understood
all
that
was
left
unspoken
in
her
heart
she
wanted
to
hold
him
thus
always
so
tightly
that
he
could
not
slip
away
on
that
pilgrimage
he
faced
so
confidently
that
pilgrimage
from
which
he
could
never
return
to
her
while
she
clung
to
him
thus
a
noise
outside
brought
them
back
to
the
things
of
earth
an
automobile
speeding
up
the
road
had
stopped
at
the
gate
ware
glanced
out
hastily
as
she
saw
the
three
men
striding
up
the
path
her
first
thought
was
one
of
housewifely
dismay
she
wondered
how
she
could
stretch
the
simple
supper
she
had
planned
for
that
evening
into
enough
for
these
unexpected
guests
if
jack
had
only
given
her
a
little
longer
notice
but
that
thought
was
immediately
thrust
aside
in
her
pleasure
at
seeing
phil
again
it
was
the
first
time
since
the
day
she
bade
him
in
the
little
wigwam
and
sent
him
out
with
her
godspeed
to
make
a
man
of
himself
his
waywardness
had
given
her
a
motherly
interest
in
him
and
now
her
quick
glance
showed
that
he
had
not
disappointed
her
that
he
had
kept
every
promise
she
welcomed
him
with
a
welcome
that
made
him
feel
that
this
was
a
real
so
that
he
called
out
to
the
old
doctor
just
behind
him
now
daddy
you
see
for
yourself
how
it
was
ware
ushered
them
at
once
into
jack
room
she
knew
he
was
waiting
impatiently
to
see
them
but
did
not
dream
how
much
was
at
stake
it
was
nearly
half
an
hour
later
when
phil
discovered
that
he
was
thirsty
and
asked
the
way
to
the
well
ware
led
him
out
through
the
kitchen
picking
up
a
pitcher
and
tumbler
as
she
went
the
windmill
was
in
motion
and
while
the
water
was
gushing
from
the
pump
spout
into
the
pitcher
phil
said
meaningly
well
aunt
emily
your
prodigal
has
come
back
yes
she
responded
it
makes
me
glad
and
proud
to
see
how
my
faith
in
him
has
been
justified
but
oh
boy
why
did
you
give
me
a
little
warning
so
that
we
might
have
had
time
to
make
ready
a
fatted
calf
jack
never
told
me
until
a
few
minutes
before
you
arrived
that
he
expected
you
i
rather
have
the
pleasure
of
surprising
you
all
than
to
share
in
a
fatted
calf
any
day
besides
there
wo
be
an
occasion
for
trotting
out
such
a
commodity
alex
will
be
going
back
to
san
antonio
in
less
than
an
hour
you
see
he
has
only
a
few
more
days
to
spend
with
his
lady
love
as
he
is
due
in
kentucky
the
last
of
this
week
he
ca
afford
to
miss
even
one
of
these
gorgeous
moonlight
nights
daddy
is
so
tired
with
his
trip
and
thinking
of
the
strain
ahead
of
him
that
he
is
in
no
trim
for
visiting
on
the
way
here
we
stopped
at
the
williams
house
and
engaged
rooms
for
i
promised
him
that
he
need
stay
up
for
supper
could
take
it
in
his
room
and
turn
in
soon
after
we
had
made
a
short
call
here
you
see
he
did
sleep
at
all
coming
out
here
so
he
is
considerably
worse
for
wear
he
very
much
interested
in
case
and
thinks
something
may
be
done
to
relieve
his
suffering
so
maybe
it
will
be
as
well
for
us
to
stay
out
here
a
bit
and
give
them
a
chance
to
look
him
over
from
the
quick
lighting
up
of
ware
face
it
was
evident
that
such
a
hope
was
a
new
one
to
her
jack
had
not
mentioned
the
prospect
of
an
operation
so
phil
left
the
subject
as
quickly
as
possible
beginning
to
tell
her
of
his
last
visit
to
joyce
as
he
had
come
directly
from
her
ware
found
so
much
to
question
him
about
that
she
was
surprised
when
alex
shelby
joined
them
to
find
that
they
had
been
leaning
against
the
windmill
tower
for
more
than
half
an
hour
too
interested
to
think
of
finding
a
seat
alex
face
was
glowing
and
he
looked
across
at
phil
with
a
nod
of
elation
your
father
confirms
my
opinion
phil
so
i
be
starting
back
at
once
when
ware
found
out
doctor
tremont
real
purpose
in
coming
she
was
thankful
that
jack
had
spared
her
all
those
days
of
anxiety
and
apprehension
that
would
have
been
hers
had
she
known
of
the
operation
earlier
as
it
was
there
would
be
only
one
night
in
which
to
dread
it
alex
was
coming
back
in
the
morning
with
a
nurse
and
it
would
all
be
over
by
noon
of
the
next
day
now
she
understood
their
consideration
in
going
to
a
hotel
it
was
not
so
much
that
doctor
tremont
was
in
no
condition
for
visiting
as
that
they
knew
that
any
guests
no
matter
how
much
desired
would
be
a
burden
on
the
eve
of
such
an
event
jack
room
was
already
nearly
as
bare
and
clean
as
a
hospital
ward
but
there
would
still
be
much
to
do
before
the
surgeons
could
begin
their
delicate
and
vital
task
so
when
alex
shelby
went
away
doctor
tremont
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
hotel
phil
was
to
follow
later
after
he
had
seen
mary
and
had
the
pleasure
of
surprising
her
chapter
xiii
jack
a
huisache
tree
leaned
over
the
old
stone
wall
which
separated
the
herdt
pasture
from
the
road
and
here
phil
took
his
stand
he
had
started
to
find
the
following
ware
directions
but
shrill
little
voices
floating
across
the
meadow
made
him
pause
it
was
evident
that
mary
and
her
small
charges
were
somewhere
near
a
moment
later
they
came
in
sight
and
for
once
in
her
life
mary
moved
on
towards
a
meeting
often
rehearsed
in
thought
which
did
not
end
ridiculously
it
would
have
been
joy
to
her
soul
could
she
have
seen
herself
as
she
looked
to
phil
coming
across
the
field
of
the
fresh
blue
and
white
dress
she
wore
repeated
the
color
of
the
waves
of
bloom
through
which
she
waded
sister
had
twined
a
wreath
of
the
same
flowers
around
the
crown
of
her
mexican
hat
and
she
carried
a
great
sheaf
of
them
across
one
arm
the
inevitable
alarm
clock
swung
from
the
other
hand
brud
was
carrying
a
butterfly
net
sister
as
a
great
favor
held
matilda
and
meliss
brought
up
the
rear
with
the
big
basket
of
which
they
had
gathered
as
a
special
act
of
courtesy
for
the
guild
ladies
their
voices
blended
happily
as
they
drew
nearer
but
when
they
were
close
enough
for
phil
to
distinguish
their
words
the
procession
stood
still
they
had
reached
the
place
where
a
path
crossed
the
one
they
were
following
and
the
was
a
short
cut
to
the
here
the
parting
of
the
ways
called
mary
gaily
so
run
along
with
meliss
now
and
be
sure
to
give
rochester
my
message
we
will
answered
brud
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
a
happy
little
squeal
it
was
so
high
and
eager
and
we
have
another
good
time
we
miss
mayry
indeed
we
will
was
the
answer
given
so
heartily
and
convincingly
that
it
was
easy
to
see
how
she
had
obtained
her
hold
on
the
two
little
friends
who
seemed
so
loath
to
leave
her
they
stood
talking
a
moment
then
sister
deposited
the
kitten
on
mary
armful
of
flowers
with
a
farewell
squeeze
and
the
parting
ceremony
began
four
voices
for
meliss
was
taking
the
part
of
the
black
panther
this
afternoon
repeated
gravely
and
distinctly
the
words
of
their
daily
benediction
wind
and
water
wood
and
tree
wisdom
strength
and
courtesy
favor
go
with
then
mary
called
as
they
started
down
the
path
mowgli
and
mowglina
panther
and
a
trio
of
happy
voices
answered
baloo
it
was
a
childish
performance
but
brud
and
sister
went
through
their
part
so
seriously
as
if
it
had
been
an
incantation
of
some
kind
that
phil
did
not
smile
as
he
watched
the
little
by
play
it
was
proof
to
him
that
mary
had
accomplished
what
she
had
set
out
to
do
she
had
inspired
them
with
an
ambition
to
always
keep
tryst
just
as
edryn
window
had
inspired
her
feeling
that
she
had
had
a
particularly
satisfactory
afternoon
mary
answered
their
last
wave
with
a
swing
of
the
hand
that
held
the
clock
and
started
on
towards
the
stone
wall
if
her
attention
had
not
been
engrossed
by
her
efforts
to
hold
the
big
armful
of
the
clock
and
the
squirming
kitten
without
dropping
one
of
the
three
she
would
have
seen
phil
stepping
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
huisache
to
meet
her
but
the
kitten
struggled
out
of
her
arms
and
climbed
up
on
her
shoulder
catching
its
claws
in
her
collar
and
biting
playfully
at
her
chin
matilda
you
little
mischief
scolded
mary
affectionately
how
am
i
ever
going
to
get
over
this
stone
wall
with
you
acting
so
come
on
i
help
you
spoke
up
phil
from
the
other
side
the
expression
of
utter
amazement
which
spread
over
her
face
when
she
looked
up
and
saw
him
standing
in
front
of
her
was
even
more
amusing
than
he
had
anticipated
it
would
be
despite
jack
hints
and
the
fact
that
they
had
set
her
to
picturing
phil
possible
coming
the
surprise
of
his
actual
presence
was
so
overwhelming
that
she
could
scarcely
speak
she
let
him
take
the
clock
and
the
wildcat
from
her
and
put
them
down
on
his
side
of
the
wall
with
the
flowers
but
not
until
she
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
wall
and
felt
the
firm
clasp
of
his
hands
outstretched
to
help
her
down
did
she
persuade
herself
that
she
was
not
dreaming
then
the
face
that
she
turned
towards
him
fairly
beamed
and
he
thought
as
he
looked
down
at
her
that
it
was
well
worth
the
long
journey
to
find
some
one
so
genuinely
glad
to
see
him
when
did
you
come
have
you
been
to
the
house
was
jack
very
much
surprised
the
questions
poured
out
in
a
steady
stream
as
soon
as
she
found
her
voice
and
if
he
had
not
been
looking
at
her
he
could
have
well
believed
that
she
was
the
same
amusing
child
she
was
when
he
found
her
running
away
from
the
indian
on
the
desert
road
to
lee
ranch
but
he
could
not
look
away
long
enough
to
keep
up
the
illusion
there
was
a
charm
about
her
face
which
drew
his
eyes
irresistibly
back
to
it
he
tried
to
determine
just
what
that
charm
was
it
was
not
of
feature
for
much
as
she
had
improved
she
did
not
at
all
measure
up
to
his
standard
of
beauty
presently
he
decided
that
it
was
just
mary
own
self
her
interesting
original
personality
shining
out
through
her
eyes
and
speaking
through
every
movement
of
her
mobile
lips
which
made
her
so
attractive
her
years
of
effort
to
grow
up
to
her
ideal
of
all
that
was
sweet
and
maidenly
had
left
their
imprint
on
her
face
naturally
unselfish
trouble
and
hard
times
had
broadened
her
sympathies
and
taught
her
a
still
deeper
consideration
for
others
loneliness
and
a
dearth
of
amusement
had
developed
her
own
resources
for
entertainment
and
taught
her
to
find
something
of
interest
in
every
object
and
person
about
her
as
he
looked
at
her
he
thought
it
a
pity
that
more
of
the
girls
of
his
acquaintance
could
have
a
course
in
the
same
hard
school
of
experience
which
had
developed
mary
into
such
a
lovable
and
interesting
character
he
felt
that
in
the
one
year
since
he
had
seen
her
last
she
had
grown
so
far
past
his
knowledge
of
her
that
it
would
be
well
worth
while
to
cultivate
her
acquaintance
further
it
was
some
distance
from
the
pasture
to
the
cottage
and
as
they
walked
phil
had
time
to
tell
her
of
his
trip
to
warwick
hall
and
to
deliver
the
mixture
of
messages
from
the
girls
which
by
this
time
had
resolved
into
a
ridiculous
despite
his
effort
to
keep
them
separate
and
his
reference
to
the
memorandum
that
betty
had
given
him
then
he
presented
the
ivy
leaf
which
he
had
plucked
for
her
as
proof
that
he
had
actually
walked
in
her
beloved
garden
up
to
that
time
there
had
been
so
much
to
say
that
mary
had
not
discovered
that
doctor
tremont
was
in
bauer
also
the
explanation
came
about
when
they
reached
the
gate
and
phil
after
opening
it
for
her
to
pass
through
stayed
on
the
outside
himself
her
surprise
at
his
not
coming
in
was
fully
as
great
as
it
had
been
when
she
first
saw
him
the
idea
of
your
going
to
a
hotel
when
you
come
all
the
way
from
new
york
to
texas
to
see
us
she
exclaimed
and
then
not
even
staying
to
supper
jack
will
be
disappointed
no
answered
phil
he
knows
the
reason
why
daddy
and
i
are
putting
up
at
the
hotel
so
does
your
mother
and
they
both
think
it
is
a
good
one
you
run
along
in
and
ask
them
and
they
convince
you
that
i
am
right
i
come
over
for
a
few
minutes
after
supper
though
just
to
show
you
that
there
no
hard
feeling
between
us
he
laughed
as
he
said
it
lifting
his
hat
and
turning
away
thoroughly
mystified
by
his
manner
mary
stood
a
moment
looking
after
him
it
was
all
so
strange
and
unreal
his
sudden
appearance
and
then
his
walking
off
in
such
a
mysterious
way
she
could
hardly
believe
the
evidence
of
her
own
eyes
yet
the
tall
handsome
figure
striding
down
the
road
was
not
of
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
her
fingers
still
tingled
with
the
warm
clasp
of
the
strong
hands
that
had
helped
her
over
the
wall
when
she
went
into
the
house
it
was
jack
who
told
her
of
his
coming
ordeal
and
he
told
her
in
a
way
to
make
it
seem
of
little
consequence
he
said
that
doctor
tremont
wanted
to
experiment
on
him
he
had
known
of
a
man
injured
in
the
same
way
whose
suffering
had
been
entirely
relieved
by
the
removal
of
a
fragment
of
bone
which
pressed
on
the
spinal
cord
it
would
be
worth
while
to
go
through
almost
anything
to
be
rid
of
the
excruciating
pain
he
had
suffered
at
times
and
doctor
tremont
assured
him
that
it
would
pass
away
entirely
if
the
operation
proved
successful
not
a
word
did
he
say
about
the
greater
hope
that
had
been
held
out
to
him
as
the
time
drew
near
he
was
beginning
to
lose
faith
in
its
being
possible
it
seemed
too
great
a
miracle
for
him
to
expect
it
to
be
wrought
for
him
mary
went
out
to
find
her
mother
in
a
daze
of
mingled
emotions
the
prospect
of
jack
being
freed
from
the
pain
that
had
racked
him
for
months
made
her
inexpressibly
happy
but
she
had
a
horror
of
operations
the
nurse
they
had
in
lone
rock
after
jack
first
one
had
spent
hours
telling
grewsome
details
of
those
she
had
known
which
were
not
successful
or
if
they
were
successful
from
the
surgeon
viewpoint
the
patients
usually
died
from
shock
later
she
wanted
to
stay
in
jack
room
every
minute
of
the
time
after
she
heard
what
was
to
be
done
for
she
had
a
sickening
foreboding
that
it
might
be
the
last
evening
he
would
be
able
to
talk
to
them
still
she
was
so
nervous
that
she
was
afraid
her
frame
of
mind
might
be
contagious
she
wondered
how
her
mother
could
sit
there
so
calmly
talking
of
the
trivial
things
that
filled
the
round
of
their
days
just
as
if
were
going
to
be
like
all
the
commonplace
yesterdays
it
was
a
relief
to
her
when
phil
came
back
according
to
promise
and
turned
their
thoughts
into
other
channels
for
awhile
as
he
rose
to
go
jack
motioned
to
a
letter
lying
on
the
table
beside
him
and
asked
phil
to
post
it
on
his
way
back
to
the
hotel
phil
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
barely
glancing
at
the
envelope
as
he
did
so
it
was
addressed
in
such
a
big
plain
hand
that
the
miss
elizabeth
lewis
on
it
caught
his
attention
as
if
the
words
had
called
out
to
him
several
other
letters
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
table
fell
to
the
floor
as
phil
coat
brushed
them
in
passing
he
stooped
mechanically
to
pick
them
up
for
he
was
busy
talking
and
without
being
conscious
of
having
noted
the
address
laid
them
back
on
the
table
but
afterwards
it
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
all
addressed
to
jack
and
by
the
same
hand
that
had
made
the
memorandum
for
him
about
the
girls
whom
he
met
at
warwick
hall
mary
wondered
afterwards
how
she
ever
could
have
lived
through
the
next
morning
had
it
not
been
for
phil
she
was
all
right
as
long
as
there
was
anything
to
do
or
while
she
sat
listening
to
doctor
tremont
talk
to
her
mother
and
the
local
physician
doctor
mackay
but
as
soon
as
alex
shelby
arrived
with
the
nurse
she
fell
into
such
a
tremor
of
nervousness
that
she
could
scarcely
keep
from
shaking
as
if
she
had
a
chill
there
was
a
cluster
of
umbrella
trees
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
yard
and
carrying
some
chairs
out
to
their
dense
shade
phil
called
her
to
come
and
sit
with
him
there
he
had
a
glove
that
was
ripped
and
he
hoped
she
would
take
pity
on
him
and
sew
it
up
she
understood
perfectly
well
his
object
in
putting
her
to
work
and
although
her
hands
trembled
at
first
so
that
she
could
barely
thread
a
needle
she
had
to
acknowledge
inwardly
that
it
was
easier
to
compose
herself
when
her
hands
were
busy
one
finger
was
ripped
the
entire
length
so
it
took
a
long
time
to
mend
it
neatly
to
buttonhole
the
edges
on
each
side
and
then
draw
the
stitches
together
in
a
seam
that
was
stronger
than
the
original
one
gradually
she
became
so
interested
in
her
task
and
what
phil
was
telling
her
of
his
adventures
in
the
past
year
that
she
stopped
glancing
every
moment
towards
the
house
and
no
longer
jumped
nervously
at
every
sound
once
or
twice
she
smiled
at
something
he
told
her
something
that
would
have
been
uproariously
funny
if
she
had
heard
it
at
any
other
time
just
now
she
could
not
forget
the
fact
that
jack
was
lying
unconscious
under
the
surgeon
knife
and
the
stories
the
lone
rock
nurse
had
told
her
came
back
to
haunt
her
with
terrifying
suggestions
i
am
to
meet
your
friend
miss
gay
melville
phil
said
when
they
had
been
sitting
there
a
long
time
shelby
is
to
take
daddy
and
me
up
to
the
post
to
dine
at
her
house
the
major
came
down
to
the
train
with
him
when
he
met
us
yesterday
morning
and
delivered
the
invitation
in
person
he
a
hospitable
old
duck
the
major
he
kin
to
some
people
that
are
intimate
friends
of
daddy
and
he
almost
ready
to
adopt
us
both
into
his
family
on
the
strength
of
it
alex
told
me
on
the
side
that
i
am
invited
specially
to
meet
a
very
particular
chum
of
his
fiancée
miss
roberta
somebody
i
ca
remember
the
name
miss
melville
thinks
i
will
find
her
my
affinity
judging
by
what
she
knows
of
her
and
has
heard
of
me
roberta
mayrell
prompted
mary
oh
i
do
think
you
find
her
she
a
fascinating
sort
of
girl
but
she
such
a
different
type
from
i
mean
i
think
well
she
was
floundering
desperately
to
turn
her
sentence
i
ca
imagine
you
care
for
her
to
the
point
what
she
had
almost
said
was
she
such
a
different
type
from
the
little
colonel
she
had
remembered
just
in
time
that
she
was
not
supposed
to
know
about
that
affair
had
she
not
been
an
unintentional
she
could
not
have
heard
his
offer
to
lloyd
of
the
unset
turquoise
and
all
that
followed
phil
noticed
her
embarrassment
and
wondered
what
caused
it
but
the
subject
was
immediately
forgotten
the
door
they
had
been
watching
so
long
opened
at
last
and
doctor
tremont
came
out
and
stood
on
the
step
phil
beckoned
and
he
came
across
to
the
clump
of
umbrella
trees
where
they
were
sitting
one
glance
at
his
face
showed
mary
that
she
had
nothing
to
fear
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
phil
shoulder
as
he
said
kindly
it
all
good
news
mary
we
found
exactly
the
state
of
affairs
that
i
expected
if
he
follows
the
other
case
on
record
it
will
not
be
long
till
he
is
as
strong
and
husky
and
active
as
this
young
rascal
here
he
gave
phil
shoulder
an
affectionate
grip
mary
looked
up
at
him
trying
to
comprehend
all
she
had
heard
strong
and
husky
and
active
as
phil
she
repeated
in
dull
wonder
you
ca
mean
that
he
will
ever
be
able
to
the
question
came
in
dry
sobbing
gasps
yes
just
that
she
stood
up
the
news
was
so
stupendous
the
reaction
so
great
that
everything
turned
black
she
sat
down
again
giddily
the
sympathetic
faces
the
trees
everything
seemed
to
be
whirling
around
and
around
she
heard
phil
voice
but
it
sounded
as
if
it
were
miles
away
brace
up
little
vicar
you
surely
not
going
limp
now
just
when
fortune
is
making
such
a
tremendous
turn
in
your
favor
no
she
said
shaking
herself
and
fighting
off
the
faintness
such
a
feeling
had
never
assailed
her
before
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
you
see
nobody
ever
told
me
i
did
know
such
a
heavenly
thing
was
possible
i
ca
believe
it
yet
oh
are
you
she
looked
up
into
the
strong
calm
face
of
the
old
surgeon
as
if
his
answer
meant
life
or
death
as
sure
as
any
one
can
be
about
any
operation
he
answered
he
has
everything
in
his
favor
there
is
the
clean
life
he
has
always
led
back
of
him
his
splendid
constitution
the
fine
aseptic
air
of
these
hills
everything
is
favorable
the
paralysis
and
all
the
other
trouble
was
caused
by
one
thing
we
have
removed
the
cause
and
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
recover
completely
in
time
he
has
rallied
from
the
anesthetic
and
is
so
happy
over
the
result
so
buoyantly
hopeful
that
that
of
itself
with
his
dogged
determination
to
get
well
will
go
a
long
distance
toward
pulling
him
through
the
tears
were
rolling
down
mary
cheeks
but
she
did
not
know
it
nor
did
she
know
that
her
face
was
ashine
at
the
same
time
with
the
inward
light
of
a
joy
too
great
for
telling
to
think
that
he
be
able
to
again
she
exclaimed
over
and
over
as
if
trying
to
grasp
the
greatness
of
such
a
fact
and
did
it
oh
doctor
tremont
there
is
anything
good
enough
in
heaven
or
earth
for
the
hand
that
could
bring
a
happiness
like
that
to
my
brother
jack
as
she
tried
brokenly
to
express
her
gratitude
and
the
good
old
doctor
tried
as
hard
to
deny
any
obligation
on
her
part
saying
he
had
only
partly
squared
himself
with
the
wares
phil
slipped
away
the
scene
was
coming
near
to
upsetting
his
own
equanimity
besides
he
had
some
telegrams
to
send
there
were
three
and
save
for
the
address
they
were
identically
the
same
operation
successful
every
reason
to
expect
complete
and
rapid
recovery
stuart
tremont
received
his
just
as
he
was
driving
in
at
the
gate
of
his
country
place
a
messenger
boy
on
a
wheel
handed
him
the
yellow
envelope
he
hurried
into
the
house
catching
up
little
patricia
and
swinging
her
to
his
shoulder
as
she
ran
to
meet
him
eugenia
was
coming
down
the
stairs
good
news
he
cried
boyishly
hurrah
for
daddy
he
brought
the
year
of
jubilee
to
the
ware
family
root
and
branch
to
say
nothing
of
the
professional
laurels
he
has
added
to
the
house
of
tremont
eugenia
answered
sometimes
i
tempted
to
wish
you
followed
in
his
footsteps
stuart
and
chosen
such
a
hard
life
but
when
i
think
what
just
one
cure
like
that
means
i
would
have
you
anything
else
in
the
world
than
what
you
are
for
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
oh
i
so
glad
for
all
of
them
joyce
will
be
nearly
wild
with
joy
she
has
been
so
broken
up
over
jack
condition
ever
since
the
accident
that
now
her
happiness
will
be
something
good
to
see
i
must
try
to
go
in
to
the
city
for
a
short
call
before
we
start
west
joyce
happiness
good
to
see
when
her
telegram
came
she
was
starting
out
of
the
studio
on
her
way
to
an
interview
with
the
art
editor
of
a
magazine
that
had
published
one
of
her
sketches
she
could
not
turn
back
because
the
appointed
hour
was
too
near
at
hand
and
the
interview
too
important
so
she
stood
in
the
corridor
after
she
left
the
elevator
wiping
away
her
happy
tears
until
she
was
composed
enough
to
go
out
on
the
street
and
because
she
had
to
share
her
good
news
with
some
one
she
told
the
janitor
wife
the
hearty
sympathy
of
that
motherly
irish
woman
sent
her
away
as
if
she
were
treading
on
air
the
art
editor
who
dimly
remembered
her
as
a
very
quiet
reserved
young
girl
wondered
at
the
transformation
when
she
came
into
his
office
looking
like
the
very
incarnation
of
joy
she
had
been
afraid
of
the
stern
forbidding
man
before
saying
to
henrietta
that
she
always
expected
him
to
bark
at
her
but
to
her
own
surprise
as
well
as
his
she
found
herself
telling
him
her
good
news
just
as
she
had
poured
it
out
to
the
janitor
wife
because
she
could
help
it
that
his
congratulations
should
be
quite
as
hearty
as
phelan
caused
her
no
surprise
then
for
at
the
moment
jack
recovery
seemed
such
a
miracle
that
she
felt
the
whole
world
must
be
interested
in
hearing
of
it
but
she
wondered
afterwards
what
he
must
have
thought
of
her
for
pouring
out
her
confidences
to
him
about
jack
as
impulsively
as
if
he
had
been
an
old
friend
instead
of
a
stranger
had
she
only
known
it
that
impulsive
outburst
aroused
a
friendly
interest
in
her
that
the
reserved
man
rarely
felt
in
struggling
young
artists
and
he
bought
all
the
sketches
she
had
with
her
an
hour
before
that
of
itself
would
have
been
enough
to
send
her
back
to
the
studio
rejoicing
but
now
it
seemed
such
a
drop
in
the
bucket
compared
to
the
news
she
had
for
boyd
and
lucy
and
henrietta
that
she
forgot
to
mention
the
little
matter
of
the
sale
for
several
days
there
was
some
delay
in
the
transmission
of
betty
message
it
did
not
reach
her
until
nearly
sundown
she
was
passing
through
the
lower
hall
on
the
way
to
the
when
the
envelope
was
put
into
her
hands
the
house
suddenly
seemed
to
grow
stifling
she
needed
all
out
of
doors
to
breathe
in
so
running
down
the
marble
steps
to
the
river
she
walked
along
to
the
circular
seat
surrounding
the
old
willow
with
the
tree
between
herself
and
the
hall
she
looked
out
across
the
potomac
that
a
gorgeous
sunset
was
turning
into
a
river
of
gold
the
slip
of
paper
fluttered
in
her
fingers
but
she
feared
to
read
it
such
tragedies
can
be
told
sometimes
in
the
short
space
of
ten
words
but
at
last
she
summoned
courage
to
glance
at
the
message
after
which
she
read
it
through
slowly
several
times
then
looking
up
above
the
shining
of
the
river
to
the
glory
of
the
sunset
sky
beyond
she
whispered
softly
as
she
had
always
done
since
she
was
a
little
child
in
the
great
moments
of
her
life
you
dear
god
the
same
afternoon
doctor
tremont
and
phil
and
alex
went
to
san
antonio
leaving
the
nurse
and
doctor
mackay
in
charge
of
jack
the
tremonts
after
dining
at
major
melville
were
to
take
the
night
train
for
california
they
had
promised
elsie
to
be
with
her
as
long
as
possible
before
her
wedding
she
had
seen
little
of
phil
for
several
years
he
was
taking
a
month
vacation
the
first
long
one
since
he
started
to
work
in
order
to
spend
the
most
of
it
with
her
in
the
old
that
had
been
their
earliest
playground
doctor
tremont
did
not
expect
to
come
back
to
bauer
but
phil
promised
to
stop
off
for
a
few
days
on
his
return
trip
which
would
be
in
a
little
less
than
three
weeks
after
the
departure
of
their
guests
the
family
settled
down
to
wait
patiently
and
happily
for
time
to
finish
the
process
of
healing
since
such
great
cause
for
thanksgiving
had
come
to
them
the
small
ills
that
every
one
is
heir
to
almost
lost
the
power
to
annoy
when
mary
burned
herself
badly
with
a
hot
iron
when
she
ruined
her
best
dress
by
spilling
a
bottle
of
ink
when
the
little
wildcat
which
grew
dearer
every
day
was
crippled
so
badly
by
a
falling
that
it
had
to
be
put
out
of
its
misery
there
were
some
tears
and
regrets
but
the
unfailing
balm
for
everything
was
the
thought
jack
getting
well
nothing
else
matters
much
as
spring
deepened
the
wild
flowers
grew
still
more
abundant
acres
of
wild
verbenas
spread
their
royal
purple
underfoot
and
the
trees
hung
answering
pennons
overhead
of
the
same
kingly
color
starred
the
grass
held
up
their
crimson
chalices
along
every
lane
mexican
blankets
sported
their
gaudy
stripes
of
red
and
yellow
and
even
the
cacti
thorny
and
forbidding
burst
into
gorgeous
bloom
and
then
just
at
easter
a
waxen
blossom
and
as
the
narcissus
sprang
up
all
over
the
hills
rain
lilies
miss
edna
called
them
norman
and
mary
gathered
great
armfuls
of
them
and
carried
them
to
rochester
to
put
around
the
chancel
they
seemed
to
suit
the
little
country
church
far
better
than
the
lilies
would
have
done
the
casement
windows
stood
open
and
mary
sat
looking
out
through
one
of
them
listening
to
the
reading
of
the
account
of
the
first
easter
very
early
in
the
morning
the
first
day
of
the
week
they
came
unto
the
sepulchre
at
the
rising
of
the
but
it
was
not
the
green
world
outside
she
saw
it
was
jack
face
as
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
earlier
in
the
morning
when
he
lay
listening
to
his
mother
read
those
same
words
she
had
heard
him
say
in
one
of
the
pauses
mother
sometimes
i
am
so
happy
i
do
see
how
i
can
endure
such
blessedness
i
dreamed
so
many
times
that
i
was
well
only
to
waken
and
find
it
all
a
cruel
mistake
that
now
when
i
realize
it
really
going
to
be
true
that
life
still
holds
everything
for
me
oh
i
tell
you
he
broke
off
a
smile
of
ineffable
happiness
spreading
over
his
face
now
i
know
how
lazarus
felt
when
the
stone
was
rolled
away
and
he
heard
the
call
forth
that
smile
was
still
before
mary
eyes
when
the
choir
rose
to
sing
and
she
joined
with
all
her
heart
in
the
chant
which
swelled
forth
at
the
end
of
every
line
into
a
glad
chapter
xiv
san
jacinto
day
it
was
the
twentieth
of
april
when
phil
returned
to
bauer
and
for
the
second
time
his
visit
was
cut
disappointingly
short
the
reason
was
that
he
had
promised
major
melville
the
night
he
dined
with
him
to
be
back
in
san
antonio
in
time
for
the
carnival
the
major
wanted
to
take
him
to
a
mexican
restaurant
for
a
typical
mexican
supper
the
night
of
the
on
the
there
would
be
an
entertainment
for
the
queen
of
the
carnival
at
her
court
of
the
roses
something
too
unique
and
beautiful
for
him
to
miss
they
all
said
then
on
the
san
jacinto
day
which
all
loyal
texans
keep
as
a
state
holiday
the
annual
battle
of
flowers
would
take
place
in
the
plaza
in
front
of
the
alamo
which
they
call
their
cradle
of
liberty
the
flower
battle
was
an
old
institution
the
major
explained
but
this
was
only
the
second
year
for
the
queen
court
and
it
was
something
so
surpassingly
beautiful
that
he
thought
it
ought
to
become
a
regular
feature
of
every
carnival
roberta
who
was
also
at
the
dinner
added
her
persuasions
you
think
you
back
in
the
time
knighthood
was
in
flower
she
insisted
i
wish
every
easterner
accustomed
to
poking
fun
at
our
state
could
see
it
nobody
knows
what
i
suffered
at
school
from
having
people
talk
as
if
all
texans
are
roberta
was
one
of
the
duchesses
last
year
explained
lieutenant
boglin
you
should
have
seen
her
sweep
up
to
the
throne
when
they
announced
grace
the
lady
roberta
of
the
house
of
mayrell
she
certainly
looked
the
real
article
and
was
a
far
cry
from
a
then
do
emphasize
the
so
pointedly
bogey
ordered
roberta
when
phil
hesitated
to
accept
because
his
time
in
bauer
would
be
shortened
so
much
thereby
gay
insisted
that
she
was
going
to
invite
mary
down
for
the
queen
entertainment
and
the
flower
battle
anyhow
and
that
if
he
refused
to
come
mary
would
be
cut
out
of
the
pleasure
of
coming
for
of
course
she
could
leave
a
guest
behind
under
the
circumstances
so
presently
the
major
programme
was
arranged
to
his
partial
satisfaction
it
was
not
complete
because
he
could
not
persuade
the
old
doctor
who
intended
spending
several
months
in
california
to
return
also
gay
went
up
to
bauer
that
same
week
directly
after
alex
departure
she
wanted
to
deliver
her
invitation
in
person
and
to
spend
the
day
with
the
ware
family
she
liked
to
hear
them
sing
praises
was
the
one
who
discovered
that
something
could
be
done
for
jack
and
he
it
was
who
had
summoned
doctor
tremont
and
every
discussion
of
the
subject
always
brought
out
the
gratifying
fact
that
had
it
not
been
for
him
jack
would
not
now
be
on
the
high
road
to
recovery
she
had
found
too
that
mary
made
a
most
satisfactory
little
confidante
much
better
than
roberta
for
she
seemed
really
interested
in
alex
and
all
that
pertained
to
him
and
never
laughed
at
rhapsodies
and
made
cynical
remarks
about
before
and
after
taking
as
the
roberta
did
two
thoughts
gave
mary
the
utmost
satisfaction
in
accepting
the
invitation
one
was
there
would
be
time
before
san
jacinto
day
to
make
up
the
white
dress
for
which
her
mother
had
embroidered
the
lovely
rosebuds
the
other
was
that
an
occasion
had
come
at
last
when
it
would
be
appropriate
for
her
to
wear
lloyd
gift
the
beautiful
chiffon
scarf
spangled
with
the
crystal
beads
which
sparkled
like
dewdrops
with
only
a
day
and
a
half
to
spend
in
bauer
phil
could
do
few
of
the
things
she
had
planned
for
his
entertainment
now
that
jack
was
better
she
did
not
like
to
take
him
away
from
the
house
long
enough
to
ride
out
to
the
barnaby
ranch
and
pole
up
to
fernbank
and
such
things
instead
all
the
time
was
spent
so
that
jack
could
have
his
full
share
of
the
visit
she
would
have
been
greatly
disappointed
had
she
not
known
she
was
going
to
see
phil
several
times
during
her
visit
to
gay
he
went
down
to
the
mexican
supper
on
the
and
she
followed
next
morning
he
was
to
take
luncheon
with
the
mayrells
that
day
so
she
did
not
see
him
till
night
when
they
all
went
in
the
same
party
to
the
entertainment
phil
and
roberta
gay
and
billy
mayrell
mary
and
lieutenant
boglin
the
stage
of
beethoven
hall
was
turned
into
a
bower
of
roses
on
this
eve
of
san
jacinto
day
and
a
great
audience
assembling
early
awaited
the
coming
of
the
queen
of
the
carnival
and
her
royal
court
in
the
patent
of
nobility
given
by
her
gracious
majesty
to
her
attendants
was
the
command
we
bid
you
to
join
with
all
of
our
loyal
subjects
in
the
mirth
and
merriment
of
this
festival
of
flowers
which
doth
commemorate
the
glorious
freedom
of
this
our
texas
won
by
the
deathless
heroism
of
the
defenders
of
the
alamo
and
the
victory
of
san
jacinto
this
call
for
mirth
and
merriment
struck
the
keynote
of
the
carnival
and
everyone
in
the
great
assembly
seemed
to
be
responding
with
the
proper
festival
spirit
back
in
the
crowded
house
in
a
seat
next
the
aisle
and
almost
at
the
entrance
door
sat
mary
ware
completely
entranced
by
all
that
was
going
on
about
her
lieutenant
boglin
was
beside
her
and
in
the
chairs
directly
behind
them
were
gay
and
billy
mayrell
roberta
and
phil
were
in
front
of
them
they
had
come
early
to
secure
these
chairs
and
the
men
had
given
the
girls
the
end
seats
in
order
that
they
might
have
unobstructed
view
of
both
aisle
and
stage
they
all
turned
so
that
conversation
was
general
until
the
house
was
nearly
filled
then
roberta
said
something
which
drew
phil
attention
wholly
to
herself
and
he
turned
his
back
on
the
others
beginning
to
talk
exclusively
to
her
gay
who
appeared
to
know
at
least
every
fourth
person
who
came
down
the
aisle
sat
like
most
of
the
audience
with
her
head
turned
expectantly
towards
the
door
and
kept
up
a
running
comment
to
mary
on
the
acquaintances
who
passed
her
with
nods
of
recognition
or
brief
words
of
greeting
the
thrum
of
the
orchestra
the
sight
of
so
many
smiling
faces
although
they
were
strange
to
her
and
the
blended
colors
of
fashionable
evening
gowns
would
have
furnished
mary
ample
entertainment
after
her
dull
winter
in
the
country
but
it
was
doubly
entertaining
with
gay
to
point
out
distinguished
people
and
give
her
bits
of
information
supplemented
by
billy
and
bogey
about
this
one
from
the
post
and
that
one
from
the
town
she
wished
that
phil
could
hear
too
she
wanted
him
to
know
what
prominent
personages
he
was
in
the
midst
of
once
when
some
celebrity
was
escorted
up
the
aisle
she
leaned
over
and
called
his
attention
to
the
procession
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
to
follow
her
glance
and
made
a
joking
response
but
returned
so
quickly
to
the
fascinating
roberta
that
mary
felt
that
his
interest
in
everything
else
just
then
was
merely
perfunctory
she
remembered
what
gay
had
said
about
his
finding
his
affinity
and
stole
a
side
glance
at
roberta
to
study
her
in
the
new
light
which
phil
interest
threw
upon
her
now
in
the
days
when
phil
worshipped
at
the
little
colonel
shrine
mary
was
perfectly
content
to
have
it
so
she
would
have
walked
over
hot
plowshares
to
have
brought
his
romance
to
a
happy
consummation
it
seemed
so
eminently
fitting
that
the
two
people
in
the
world
whom
she
had
invested
with
halos
should
stand
together
on
the
same
pedestal
in
her
affections
to
her
doting
eyes
lloyd
was
such
an
angel
that
she
knew
phil
must
be
happy
with
her
and
phil
measured
so
fully
up
to
the
notch
on
the
sterling
which
indicated
the
inches
and
ells
that
a
true
prince
should
be
that
she
was
sure
no
girl
who
wove
her
for
him
could
fail
to
find
the
happiness
that
was
written
for
her
in
the
stars
mary
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
fact
by
this
time
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
in
her
reading
of
the
stars
lloyd
was
destined
for
someone
else
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
before
that
maybe
phil
was
too
the
thought
that
he
would
carry
a
secret
sorrow
with
him
to
the
grave
invested
him
with
a
melancholy
charm
that
made
him
all
the
more
interesting
it
was
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
her
to
see
him
watch
the
downward
sweep
and
swift
upward
glance
of
roberta
pretty
eyes
in
such
an
admiring
way
although
mary
herself
had
heretofore
found
pleasure
in
watching
them
of
course
she
did
want
him
to
go
on
suffering
always
still
she
did
want
him
to
forget
in
her
passionate
loyalty
to
lloyd
she
resented
his
bestowing
a
second
glance
on
any
girl
who
was
any
less
of
an
angel
than
she
and
yet
her
loyalty
to
phil
made
her
want
him
to
have
whatever
he
wanted
knowing
how
many
men
had
fallen
victims
to
roberta
flirtatious
little
ways
she
longed
to
save
phil
from
the
same
fate
the
growing
alarm
with
which
she
watched
them
was
almost
comical
for
one
of
her
years
it
was
comical
because
it
was
so
motherly
not
a
particle
of
jealousy
or
a
thought
of
self
entered
into
it
a
hush
fell
on
the
great
audience
and
the
curtain
rose
on
a
tableau
of
surpassing
loveliness
the
stage
seemed
to
be
one
mass
of
american
beauty
roses
the
walls
were
festooned
and
garlanded
with
them
they
covered
the
high
throne
in
the
centre
and
bordered
the
steps
leading
up
to
it
they
hung
in
long
streamers
on
either
side
from
ceiling
to
floor
grouped
against
this
glowing
background
stood
the
noble
dukes
the
and
their
esquires
the
satins
and
brocades
of
their
court
costumes
the
gleam
of
jewelled
the
shine
of
powdered
perukes
transported
one
from
prosaic
times
and
lands
to
the
old
days
of
chivalry
and
romance
the
jester
shook
his
bells
the
trumpeters
in
their
plumed
helmets
raised
their
long
shining
trumpets
and
sounded
the
notes
that
heralded
the
first
approach
then
the
lord
chamberlain
stepped
forth
in
a
brave
array
of
pink
satin
carrying
the
gold
stick
that
was
his
insignia
of
office
that
me
friend
whispered
gay
the
man
who
originated
this
affair
i
tell
him
i
think
he
must
be
one
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
or
else
the
wizard
merlin
come
to
life
again
to
bring
such
a
beautiful
old
court
scene
into
being
in
the
way
he
has
done
she
stopped
whispering
to
hear
the
impressive
announcement
he
was
making
in
a
voice
that
rang
through
the
hall
her
grace
lady
elizabeth
of
the
house
of
lancaster
immediately
every
eye
turned
from
the
stage
to
look
at
the
entrance
door
the
orchestra
struck
into
an
inspiring
march
and
the
stately
beauty
first
to
arrive
at
the
court
of
roses
began
her
triumphal
entry
up
the
long
aisle
she
passed
so
near
to
mary
that
the
tulle
bow
on
the
directoire
stick
she
carried
almost
touched
her
cheek
with
its
long
floating
ends
light
as
gossamer
web
and
mary
clasping
her
hands
together
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
noted
every
detail
of
the
beautiful
costume
in
its
slow
passing
it
like
the
princess
olga
she
thought
recalling
the
old
of
the
enchanted
necklace
whiter
than
the
whiteness
of
the
fairest
lily
fine
like
the
finest
lace
that
the
weave
and
softer
than
the
softest
ermine
of
the
snow
the
long
court
train
that
swept
behind
her
was
all
aglisten
as
if
embroidered
with
dewdrops
and
pearls
mary
watched
her
scarcely
breathing
till
she
had
ascended
the
steps
to
the
stage
then
her
appointed
duke
came
forward
to
meet
her
and
led
her
to
the
steps
of
the
throne
the
music
stopped
again
the
heralds
sounded
their
trumpets
and
the
lord
chamberlain
announced
the
next
duchess
you
see
explained
gay
hastily
as
all
necks
craned
toward
the
door
again
each
girl
is
duchess
of
some
rose
or
other
like
killarney
or
malmaison
or
maréchal
niel
one
after
another
they
passed
by
to
take
their
places
beside
the
throne
all
in
such
exquisitely
beautiful
costumes
that
mary
thought
that
each
one
must
be
indelibly
photographed
on
her
memory
but
when
they
had
passed
all
she
could
remember
of
so
many
was
a
spangled
procession
of
court
trains
covered
with
cascades
of
crystal
and
silver
and
pearls
and
strung
jewels
each
time
a
new
duchess
swept
slowly
and
majestically
by
mary
turned
a
quick
glance
toward
phil
to
see
if
he
were
properly
impressed
but
when
the
queen
was
announced
she
had
no
eyes
for
anything
but
the
regal
figure
proceeding
slowly
up
the
aisle
amid
the
admiring
applause
which
almost
drowned
the
music
of
the
march
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
phil
glanced
back
at
mary
her
face
so
plainly
showed
the
admiration
which
filled
her
that
he
continued
to
watch
her
with
an
amused
smile
saying
to
roberta
in
an
undertone
look
at
mary
rapt
expression
she
always
adored
queens
and
such
things
and
now
she
feels
that
she
up
against
the
real
article
i
do
wonder
answered
roberta
herself
so
interested
that
she
turned
her
back
on
phil
until
the
royal
party
had
passed
by
two
little
pages
in
costumes
of
white
and
gold
with
plumed
hats
and
spangled
capes
bore
the
royal
train
and
roberta
tried
to
upset
the
dignity
of
one
of
them
who
was
a
little
friend
of
hers
by
whispering
hello
gerald
where
did
you
get
that
feather
in
mary
estimation
it
was
not
the
diamond
crown
that
marked
the
queen
as
especially
regal
not
the
jewelled
sceptre
nor
the
white
satin
gown
heavily
embroidered
in
gold
roses
and
gleaming
with
brilliants
it
was
the
fact
that
the
long
train
borne
by
the
little
pages
was
of
to
mary
was
more
royal
than
ermine
or
purple
velvet
and
lovingly
associated
in
her
thought
with
the
white
samite
of
tennyson
idyls
it
was
that
the
lily
maid
of
astolat
had
worn
to
her
burying
and
the
only
piece
that
mary
had
ever
seen
was
the
drapery
over
the
bier
of
the
fair
elaine
when
lloyd
took
the
part
of
the
lily
maid
in
the
tableaux
at
the
beeches
when
she
caught
sight
of
it
she
clasped
her
hands
still
tighter
and
never
took
her
eyes
from
it
until
the
queen
was
seated
on
her
throne
and
the
long
shining
folds
swept
down
beside
her
the
full
length
of
the
steps
the
presentation
scene
followed
in
the
name
of
the
order
of
the
alamo
the
queen
was
given
a
magnificent
necklace
with
a
jewelled
pendant
after
that
the
visiting
duchesses
were
received
representing
many
towns
of
texas
from
el
paso
to
the
gulf
they
came
with
their
maids
of
honor
and
when
they
had
been
met
by
their
and
their
esquires
the
entertainment
for
the
queen
began
grecian
maidens
bearing
garlands
of
roses
danced
before
her
the
second
group
was
of
seven
little
barefoot
girls
carrying
golden
lyres
and
forming
a
rainbow
background
for
another
small
maid
who
gave
a
cymbal
dance
the
grecian
dances
were
followed
by
a
gavotte
of
the
time
of
louis
xiii
in
which
all
the
dukes
and
duchesses
took
part
they
danced
the
minuet
last
year
commented
gay
this
is
the
end
of
the
performance
but
we
wait
to
watch
them
go
out
on
their
way
to
the
queen
ball
i
went
to
that
too
last
year
these
are
good
seats
we
catch
them
coming
and
going
the
audience
remaining
seated
until
all
the
members
of
the
court
had
passed
out
two
by
two
had
ample
time
for
comment
and
observation
bogey
who
seeing
mary
absorbing
interest
in
the
scene
had
considerately
left
her
undisturbed
most
of
the
time
now
leaned
over
and
began
to
talk
as
gay
had
once
said
when
it
comes
to
giving
a
girl
a
good
time
bogey
is
quite
the
nicest
officer
in
the
bunch
and
phil
overhearing
scraps
of
their
conversation
concluded
that
mary
was
finding
her
escort
as
entertaining
as
the
pageant
a
backward
glance
now
and
then
showed
that
she
was
not
watching
the
recessional
as
closely
as
she
was
listening
to
him
as
they
all
started
out
of
the
hall
together
moving
slowly
along
with
the
crowd
barely
an
inch
at
a
time
they
talked
over
arrangements
for
the
next
day
lieutenant
boglin
could
not
be
counted
in
he
had
to
ride
in
the
procession
with
the
rest
of
the
troops
from
the
post
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
parade
billy
mayrell
had
another
engagement
so
phil
proposed
to
take
all
three
of
the
girls
under
his
wing
it
was
too
late
to
secure
seats
in
the
plaza
from
which
to
watch
the
flower
battle
the
major
had
been
able
to
get
only
two
so
phil
said
the
major
and
his
wife
should
occupy
those
he
would
come
around
for
the
girls
in
an
automobile
and
they
could
watch
the
parade
seated
in
that
there
was
a
blockade
near
the
door
but
as
soon
as
they
could
get
through
it
they
all
walked
up
the
street
to
a
building
in
which
the
major
had
secured
the
use
of
a
window
from
which
they
could
watch
the
parade
of
the
queen
and
her
court
on
their
way
to
the
ball
the
time
spent
in
waiting
was
well
worth
while
when
it
finally
appeared
the
horses
of
the
chariots
were
led
by
nubian
servants
and
each
chariot
represented
a
rose
wherein
sat
the
duchess
who
had
made
it
her
choice
the
queen
chariot
was
surmounted
by
a
mammoth
american
beauty
rose
and
as
she
smiled
out
from
the
midst
of
its
petals
mary
had
one
more
entrancing
view
of
the
royal
robes
this
time
they
were
lit
up
by
the
red
gleam
of
torches
for
eight
four
on
a
side
accompanied
each
chariot
and
added
their
light
to
the
brilliant
illuminations
of
the
streets
you
must
see
the
river
said
billy
mayrell
after
the
procession
had
passed
by
nobody
can
describe
it
with
the
lights
strung
across
it
from
shore
to
shore
all
down
its
winding
course
it
makes
you
think
of
venice
he
led
them
to
a
place
where
they
could
look
across
a
bend
and
see
one
of
the
bridges
it
was
strung
so
thickly
with
red
lights
which
outlined
every
part
that
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
glowing
rubies
and
its
reflection
in
the
water
made
another
shining
ruby
bridge
below
wavering
on
the
dark
current
mary
leaned
over
the
rail
watching
the
shimmering
lights
and
feeling
dreamily
that
this
city
of
the
alamo
was
an
enchanted
city
that
the
buildings
looming
up
on
every
side
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
barter
and
trade
they
were
thrown
up
simply
as
backgrounds
for
the
dazzling
illuminations
which
outlined
them
against
the
night
sky
the
horns
of
the
revellers
answering
each
other
down
every
street
the
music
of
distant
bands
the
laughter
of
the
jostling
throngs
all
deepened
the
illusion
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
this
could
be
the
city
through
which
she
had
once
tramped
in
the
rain
discouraged
and
forlorn
in
search
of
a
home
it
was
a
realm
given
over
utterly
to
mirth
and
merriment
where
a
gracious
young
queen
held
sway
where
illness
and
trouble
and
grief
had
no
part
i
do
wonder
that
the
major
wants
everybody
not
already
a
loyal
texan
to
see
this
she
said
to
the
lieutenant
it
enough
to
make
one
want
to
live
here
always
she
made
the
same
remark
to
gay
next
afternoon
as
she
sat
beside
her
on
the
back
seat
of
the
automobile
roberta
was
on
the
front
seat
with
phil
he
had
ordered
a
machine
which
he
could
drive
himself
and
they
had
taken
a
run
through
the
principal
streets
to
see
all
the
decorations
before
coming
to
a
standstill
to
wait
for
the
procession
it
was
an
inspiring
scene
the
grandstand
packed
with
applauding
spectators
the
plaza
crowded
from
park
to
curbstone
shops
and
offices
had
closed
for
the
day
schools
were
dismissed
and
all
work
abandoned
as
far
as
possible
in
order
that
everyone
might
share
in
the
carnival
the
wise
old
town
knows
the
full
worth
of
holidays
and
makes
the
most
of
each
one
the
chariots
mary
had
seen
in
the
streets
the
night
before
lost
some
of
their
glamour
seen
by
day
but
the
duchesses
and
their
were
dressed
now
in
the
colors
of
their
chosen
roses
instead
of
the
and
there
were
many
new
features
in
this
parade
floats
and
handsomely
decorated
carriages
and
a
long
line
of
troops
from
the
post
with
the
famous
military
bands
it
was
hard
to
sit
still
when
they
played
so
inspiringly
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
alamo
went
the
two
divisions
of
the
parade
meeting
and
passing
and
turning
to
meet
and
pass
again
all
the
while
pelting
each
other
with
flowers
till
the
plaza
where
they
rode
was
covered
deep
with
them
and
the
bands
played
and
the
people
cheered
till
the
smallest
schoolboy
in
their
midst
felt
a
thrill
of
gratitude
to
the
heroes
whose
deeds
they
were
commemorating
he
might
miss
the
deeper
meaning
of
it
all
but
he
grasped
one
fact
clearly
enough
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
grim
battle
which
those
brave
fellows
fought
to
the
death
there
would
have
been
no
san
jacinto
day
for
him
no
holiday
to
make
one
feel
that
it
is
a
great
and
glorious
thing
to
be
a
son
of
the
lone
star
state
phil
dined
at
the
major
again
that
night
and
roberta
was
the
only
other
guest
beside
mary
gay
had
objected
when
her
father
proposed
others
saying
that
they
intended
to
devote
the
entire
evening
to
music
since
they
had
discovered
what
a
magnificent
voice
tremont
had
and
he
had
discovered
what
proficient
accompanists
she
and
roberta
were
they
had
decided
to
treat
themselves
to
a
musicale
given
by
the
three
with
only
mary
for
audience
the
family
could
listen
of
course
but
with
the
understanding
that
there
was
to
be
no
conversation
as
the
major
had
an
engagement
which
took
him
out
immediately
after
dinner
and
melville
had
some
friends
drop
in
to
call
soon
after
it
happened
that
their
audience
was
limited
to
one
now
the
one
thing
that
mary
enjoyed
above
all
others
was
hearing
phil
sing
and
quite
the
pleasantest
part
of
her
whole
visit
was
that
last
evening
spent
in
listening
to
him
with
roberta
at
the
piano
and
gay
improvising
wonderfully
soft
and
lovely
accompaniments
on
her
violin
mary
had
heard
two
celebrated
opera
singers
while
in
washington
but
in
her
opinion
neither
one
equalled
phil
phil
surprise
would
have
been
unbounded
could
he
have
known
that
she
was
comparing
his
singing
to
the
angel
israfel
whose
heartstrings
were
a
lute
and
who
had
the
sweetest
voice
of
all
god
creatures
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
still
greater
surprise
if
he
could
have
known
the
exalted
opinion
that
mary
had
of
him
not
that
any
sentimental
interest
entered
into
her
regard
for
him
despite
her
eighteen
years
and
her
womanly
attitude
towards
the
world
in
general
she
was
still
a
little
girl
and
a
very
humble
little
girl
in
her
own
estimation
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
was
her
ideal
the
man
whose
good
opinion
she
valued
above
all
things
whose
approval
made
her
inexpressibly
happy
and
whose
advice
she
eagerly
followed
she
had
adored
him
for
years
as
little
girls
do
sometimes
look
up
to
and
adore
grown
men
and
had
stored
away
in
her
memory
many
a
remark
that
he
forgot
as
soon
as
it
was
uttered
there
was
the
time
she
confided
to
him
her
grief
at
being
so
fat
and
her
ambition
to
be
an
airy
fairy
lillian
like
lloyd
he
did
not
even
smile
and
he
answered
so
gravely
and
kindly
that
she
remembered
even
yet
the
consolation
that
his
words
gave
her
another
time
she
overheard
him
referring
to
her
as
an
angel
unawares
because
she
had
unknowingly
done
him
a
service
by
repeating
something
lloyd
had
said
about
him
from
that
time
on
that
was
the
part
she
longed
to
play
in
his
life
she
burned
to
be
the
angel
unawares
who
could
help
him
to
the
attainment
of
everything
he
wanted
that
was
why
she
had
been
so
bitterly
disappointed
when
lloyd
engagement
to
rob
moore
had
been
announced
she
wanted
lloyd
to
marry
phil
because
she
knew
that
was
what
phil
wanted
now
that
that
was
not
possible
she
was
just
as
ready
to
help
him
if
he
should
ever
love
again
she
hardly
thought
that
he
could
do
though
it
seemed
so
incredible
that
he
should
ever
find
another
as
fine
and
high
and
sweet
as
the
princess
winsome
it
was
still
more
incredible
that
once
having
set
his
mark
that
high
he
could
ever
look
at
anything
less
his
powerful
voice
filled
the
room
with
a
sweetness
that
brought
an
ache
to
her
throat
and
sometimes
tears
to
her
eyes
presently
roberta
rummaged
out
some
old
old
melodies
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
and
the
bedouin
when
she
asked
for
that
last
one
mary
cringed
inwardly
as
if
she
had
been
hurt
herself
so
sure
was
she
that
it
must
bring
up
painful
memories
to
phil
she
fully
expected
to
see
him
lay
it
aside
with
some
excuse
for
not
singing
it
she
remembered
as
vividly
as
if
it
were
only
last
night
how
she
had
sat
on
the
floor
of
the
library
at
the
locusts
listening
to
the
notes
of
his
guitar
as
he
sang
to
lloyd
outside
on
the
porch
till
the
stars
are
old
and
the
sun
grows
cold
and
the
leaves
of
the
judgment
book
unfold
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
see
how
lloyd
ever
listened
to
any
other
wooing
after
that
had
any
one
sung
that
to
in
that
voice
it
would
have
won
her
so
completely
that
she
would
have
risen
like
the
sleeping
beauty
at
the
call
of
the
prince
beyond
the
night
across
the
day
through
all
the
world
she
followed
him
to
her
surprise
phil
took
up
the
sheet
of
music
as
nonchalantly
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before
but
when
he
began
to
sing
it
seemed
to
her
anxious
ear
that
he
sang
it
more
feelingly
than
anything
she
had
ever
heard
it
was
plain
enough
to
her
now
that
he
had
not
ceased
to
care
it
wrung
her
heart
to
hear
him
sing
it
so
pouring
out
his
soul
in
a
flood
of
noble
devotion
which
he
knew
could
never
be
requited
but
which
would
live
on
till
the
sun
lost
its
heat
and
the
stars
their
light
i
love
that
song
said
roberta
laying
it
aside
to
pick
up
another
but
i
like
to
meet
that
fiery
old
duck
of
a
bedouin
when
the
leaves
of
the
judgment
book
unfold
and
find
out
how
long
his
devotion
kept
up
to
mark
then
she
trilled
airily
men
are
gay
deceivers
ever
under
the
circumstances
the
remark
seemed
flippant
almost
sacrilegious
to
mary
she
gave
roberta
a
disapproving
glance
behind
her
back
thinking
little
know
about
it
if
you
could
see
as
i
do
now
how
phil
is
hiding
his
real
feelings
you
realize
that
man
at
least
capable
of
the
deathless
devotion
you
scoff
at
the
evening
was
over
all
too
soon
phil
was
to
take
roberta
home
on
his
way
back
to
the
hotel
and
when
he
rose
to
go
said
i
not
make
my
farewells
now
my
train
does
leave
till
nearly
noon
so
i
call
some
time
during
the
morning
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
major
and
see
you
all
again
you
have
to
say
to
mary
now
said
gay
she
insists
on
taking
that
horrid
freight
car
back
to
bauer
at
seven
in
the
morning
i
must
said
mary
you
know
they
need
me
now
that
the
nurse
is
gone
and
i
already
been
away
two
days
roberta
went
out
into
the
hall
for
her
hat
and
gay
followed
as
far
as
the
door
talking
as
she
went
and
i
have
had
any
visit
with
at
all
said
phil
who
was
standing
hat
in
hand
looking
down
at
mary
i
have
had
a
word
with
you
by
yourself
and
you
have
confided
once
in
me
or
asked
me
a
single
scrap
of
advice
it
does
seem
natural
but
i
not
going
to
let
you
escape
me
this
way
i
going
down
to
the
train
in
the
morning
to
see
you
off
gay
turned
in
time
to
hear
the
last
part
of
his
sentence
that
is
she
corrected
if
you
are
called
in
time
they
do
always
do
it
at
hotels
when
they
say
they
will
i
had
some
bad
experiences
that
way
so
if
he
does
appear
mary
you
can
console
yourself
with
the
thought
that
he
like
kathleen
mavourneen
still
i
be
there
was
the
confident
reply
as
he
smiled
down
into
wistful
eyes
and
held
out
his
hand
to
say
electric
bells
are
not
as
romantic
as
the
of
the
hunter
heard
on
the
hill
but
they
more
effective
when
it
comes
to
getting
a
fellow
up
in
the
morning
you
see
me
sure
chapter
xv
new
trails
the
train
to
bauer
left
so
early
that
mary
had
to
take
the
first
passing
the
post
in
order
to
reach
the
station
in
time
gay
had
announced
her
intention
of
going
down
with
her
but
did
not
awaken
until
mary
who
occupied
an
adjoining
room
was
nearly
dressed
and
the
maid
was
bringing
up
a
breakfast
on
a
tray
but
mary
could
not
honestly
share
gay
regrets
at
being
late
she
had
dressed
noiselessly
on
purpose
not
to
waken
her
she
wanted
to
go
alone
in
order
to
have
those
last
moments
with
phil
all
to
herself
and
she
was
so
elated
when
she
finally
got
away
from
the
house
unaccompanied
that
she
could
have
sung
aloud
her
route
took
her
through
alamo
plaza
again
and
the
streets
which
still
bore
witness
to
the
presence
of
the
carnival
all
the
buildings
were
still
gay
with
bunting
and
flags
flapped
merrily
in
the
morning
sunshine
she
wondered
which
would
be
first
to
reach
the
station
and
all
the
way
down
phil
face
was
before
her
she
could
see
just
the
way
he
would
look
coming
towards
her
through
the
crowd
tall
and
distinguished
and
with
such
a
jolly
twinkle
in
his
handsome
eyes
and
he
would
call
out
hullo
little
vicar
i
beat
you
to
it
or
some
such
friendly
greeting
as
that
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
smiling
to
herself
but
it
made
no
difference
there
was
no
one
to
see
for
the
men
on
the
car
were
all
hidden
behind
their
morning
papers
when
she
reached
the
station
only
a
few
people
were
in
sight
and
when
she
climbed
into
the
coach
at
the
end
of
the
long
line
of
there
were
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
passengers
aboard
all
of
them
looked
sleepy
and
a
series
of
gentle
snores
attracted
her
attention
to
an
old
countryman
curled
up
on
a
back
seat
with
his
valise
for
a
pillow
on
her
way
in
she
had
passed
through
the
and
given
a
hasty
look
around
to
see
if
phil
were
ahead
of
her
glancing
up
at
the
clock
she
found
that
she
had
ten
minutes
to
spare
three
of
these
passed
in
getting
settled
and
in
taking
an
inventory
of
her
then
she
began
to
hang
out
of
the
window
and
anxiously
watch
the
door
she
was
growing
uneasy
maybe
the
clerk
forgotten
to
call
him
maybe
he
slumbering
still
as
gay
had
prophesied
he
might
have
missed
the
car
he
should
have
taken
or
there
might
be
a
somewhere
along
the
line
a
colored
man
hurried
into
the
coach
with
a
chunk
of
ice
for
the
water
cooler
the
conductor
came
down
the
platform
looking
at
his
watch
and
signalled
something
to
a
brakeman
mary
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
again
and
looked
anxiously
up
and
down
whispering
in
a
flutter
of
nervousness
oh
does
he
come
why
he
come
only
a
minute
or
two
left
and
there
wo
be
time
for
a
word
she
would
not
admit
the
possibility
of
his
not
coming
at
all
until
she
heard
the
warning
all
aboard
the
ringing
of
the
engine
bell
and
felt
the
jerk
and
jar
which
proclaimed
all
too
plainly
that
the
car
was
in
motion
she
was
so
disappointed
that
she
could
hardly
keep
the
tears
back
her
last
thought
before
falling
asleep
the
night
before
and
the
first
one
on
awakening
had
been
that
she
was
going
to
see
the
best
man
by
himself
a
few
moments
without
any
talkative
roberta
to
absorb
his
attention
or
any
other
people
to
run
away
with
the
conversation
it
was
a
very
disconsolate
little
face
that
turned
towards
the
open
window
to
hide
its
disappointment
from
possibly
curious
neighbors
she
found
it
hard
to
wink
the
tears
back
when
she
was
so
deeply
grievously
disappointed
her
back
was
turned
resolutely
towards
the
aisle
and
her
arms
were
crossed
on
the
in
that
position
she
could
not
see
the
rear
door
of
the
car
open
and
some
one
come
in
from
the
back
platform
he
stood
a
moment
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
breathing
fast
as
if
he
had
been
running
then
after
a
searching
glance
through
the
car
he
went
directly
down
the
aisle
and
stopped
beside
mary
seat
her
attitude
even
to
the
droop
of
her
proclaimed
her
dejection
so
clearly
that
a
smile
twitched
the
corners
of
his
mouth
then
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
so
deep
that
it
was
fairly
sepulchral
i
beg
pardon
miss
may
i
occupy
this
end
of
the
seat
startled
by
the
strange
voice
so
near
she
turned
a
very
sober
and
unsmiling
face
to
see
what
manner
of
person
had
accosted
her
then
she
exclaimed
in
astonishment
why
phil
tremont
how
ever
did
you
get
on
without
my
seeing
you
i
looked
and
looked
and
thought
you
must
have
gotten
left
then
realizing
that
the
train
was
well
under
way
and
they
had
been
carried
some
distance
past
the
station
she
cried
in
alarm
but
you
ca
get
off
they
carrying
you
away
she
was
almost
wringing
her
hands
in
her
excitement
well
i
do
mind
it
if
you
do
said
phil
sitting
down
beside
her
and
laughing
at
her
concern
i
going
along
with
you
something
miss
roberta
said
last
night
on
her
way
home
started
me
to
thinking
and
the
result
was
i
decided
to
spend
another
day
and
night
in
bauer
positively
my
last
appearance
however
i
leave
for
good
in
the
morning
what
roberta
could
have
said
to
make
such
a
change
in
his
plans
was
more
than
mary
could
imagine
she
almost
had
to
bite
her
tongue
to
keep
from
asking
and
phil
knowing
that
he
had
aroused
her
wildest
curiosity
laughed
again
but
he
wasted
no
more
time
in
teasing
her
no
really
he
said
i
was
joking
a
telegram
from
my
firm
routed
me
out
about
six
this
morning
they
want
me
to
go
to
louis
to
see
some
parties
before
returning
to
new
york
i
figured
it
out
that
i
could
double
things
up
there
so
as
to
give
me
one
more
day
here
but
it
took
me
so
long
to
figure
it
that
by
the
time
i
had
made
up
my
mind
there
was
only
a
moment
to
stuff
my
things
into
my
and
call
a
taxicab
when
i
got
down
to
the
station
i
saw
i
had
about
three
minutes
in
which
to
snatch
a
sandwich
and
a
cup
of
coffee
at
the
lunch
counter
but
the
coffee
was
so
hot
i
came
near
missing
my
train
had
to
run
a
block
and
swing
up
on
the
rear
platform
if
it
had
been
the
regular
express
i
could
have
caught
it
luckily
it
was
a
freight
so
here
i
am
he
did
not
add
that
an
unaccountable
impulse
to
go
back
to
bauer
had
seized
him
the
night
before
when
he
bade
her
or
that
the
impulse
had
been
strengthened
afterward
by
a
casual
remark
of
about
lieutenant
boglin
roberta
thought
she
saw
the
first
symptoms
of
a
budding
romance
on
bogey
part
not
being
given
to
the
practice
of
analyzing
his
feelings
phil
did
not
stop
to
ask
himself
why
it
should
make
any
difference
to
him
what
the
lieutenant
thought
of
little
mary
ware
nor
did
he
realize
at
the
time
how
much
that
remark
influenced
his
decision
to
spend
one
more
day
with
her
afterwards
he
used
to
say
that
it
was
fate
and
not
himself
that
was
responsible
for
that
journey
that
it
was
destined
from
the
beginning
he
should
chase
madly
after
that
catch
it
and
thereby
give
himself
four
long
uninterrupted
hours
in
which
to
grow
better
acquainted
with
her
than
he
had
ever
been
before
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
knew
why
he
had
been
drawn
back
it
was
that
her
real
self
the
depth
of
whose
charm
he
had
not
even
half
suspected
should
be
revealed
to
him
in
the
intimacy
of
this
conversation
it
changed
his
whole
attitude
toward
her
to
find
how
much
she
had
changed
herself
how
she
had
grown
and
developed
in
some
ways
she
was
still
the
amusing
child
whose
unexpected
sayings
had
first
attracted
him
she
would
always
be
that
but
she
was
so
much
more
now
and
again
as
on
the
day
he
met
her
in
the
field
of
he
found
himself
watching
her
trying
to
decide
just
wherein
her
charm
lay
and
how
it
made
her
different
from
any
other
girl
he
had
ever
known
sometimes
he
would
almost
lose
what
she
was
saying
puzzling
over
the
problem
at
the
stone
quarry
while
they
waited
a
long
time
for
the
engine
to
switch
off
some
empty
cars
and
pick
up
some
loaded
ones
they
left
the
coach
and
walked
up
and
down
beside
the
track
they
were
talking
about
gay
and
alex
and
he
laughed
at
her
outspoken
honesty
in
expressing
her
opinion
about
their
delayed
wedding
i
think
it
so
sensible
for
them
to
wait
till
he
got
something
saved
up
for
a
rainy
day
when
he
nothing
now
but
his
practice
it
like
providing
a
sort
of
financial
umbrella
really
it
is
just
like
starting
out
without
a
sign
of
an
umbrella
when
you
know
it
going
to
rain
and
trusting
to
luck
to
keep
you
dry
for
people
to
marry
with
nothing
to
depend
on
but
an
uncertain
salary
phil
laughed
as
he
answered
what
a
little
pessimist
you
are
mary
it
always
rain
and
people
married
without
such
a
provision
who
lived
happily
ever
after
but
it
does
oftener
than
it
does
she
insisted
papa
and
mamma
lived
happily
and
he
had
only
his
practice
as
a
young
lawyer
but
look
what
we
been
through
since
he
died
things
would
have
come
to
such
a
pass
when
his
health
broke
down
if
there
had
been
something
laid
away
for
such
emergencies
joyce
and
i
have
often
talked
about
it
when
had
to
pinch
and
work
and
economize
down
to
the
last
cent
so
you
never
marry
a
man
who
has
only
the
shelter
of
a
salary
to
offer
you
said
phil
teasingly
i
did
say
that
answered
mary
her
face
puckered
up
into
a
puzzled
expression
i
do
want
to
and
i
do
i
would
but
honestly
i
do
know
what
i
would
do
i
afraid
that
if
i
loved
a
man
as
much
as
you
ought
to
to
be
his
wife
that
i
be
every
bit
as
foolish
as
anybody
else
and
that
i
marry
him
even
if
i
had
to
take
in
back
stairs
to
scrub
for
a
living
but
i
do
hope
i
have
more
sense
or
else
he
wo
be
that
kind
of
a
man
it
is
that
i
mind
work
she
added
but
i
so
tired
of
doing
without
and
making
over
and
tugging
and
pulling
to
make
both
ends
meet
do
you
know
what
they
call
me
at
home
the
of
the
treasury
and
you
can
guess
what
i
had
to
be
like
to
earn
such
a
name
i
earned
it
too
all
right
i
fought
over
every
penny
and
i
hate
to
keep
on
in
the
same
old
rut
all
the
rest
of
my
days
it
would
be
so
nice
to
look
forward
to
a
luxurious
old
age
she
laughed
when
she
had
said
it
but
such
a
tired
little
sigh
came
first
and
that
wistful
look
again
in
her
honest
straightforward
eyes
as
she
glanced
up
at
him
that
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
desire
such
as
no
one
else
had
ever
inspired
before
to
pick
her
up
and
carry
her
away
from
all
her
troubles
to
surround
her
with
all
the
girlish
pleasures
and
pretty
things
she
loved
and
to
humor
every
whim
all
the
rest
of
her
life
but
all
he
said
was
and
if
you
were
a
man
i
suppose
you
would
feel
the
same
way
about
it
oh
more
so
she
cried
the
more
i
thought
of
a
girl
the
surer
want
to
be
that
she
need
never
face
that
rainy
day
unprotected
she
stooped
to
pick
a
tiny
yellow
star
from
a
clump
of
broom
growing
alongside
the
track
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
moment
then
he
said
with
an
amused
at
her
you
ca
imagine
how
funny
it
seems
to
hear
such
practical
talks
on
matrimony
from
an
girl
like
you
i
feel
as
if
i
had
a
scolding
from
my
grandmother
and
that
have
to
own
up
that
i
did
it
but
i
sorry
and
i
never
do
it
again
did
what
queried
mary
in
surprise
spent
everything
as
fast
as
i
made
it
had
money
to
burn
and
burnt
it
i
do
ask
any
better
salary
than
i
been
receiving
for
several
years
of
course
when
i
go
in
by
myself
that
be
another
matter
but
i
have
to
own
up
out
of
it
all
i
saved
practically
nothing
i
have
spent
it
in
riotous
living
and
it
does
seem
that
i
been
particularly
extravagant
but
it
gone
it
just
slipped
through
my
fingers
oh
well
began
mary
that
different
in
what
way
is
it
different
he
persisted
when
she
did
not
go
on
well
if
a
man
does
mind
getting
wet
himself
it
nobody
business
if
he
takes
chances
it
the
man
who
expects
to
to
have
some
one
else
to
protect
who
ought
to
be
ready
for
the
possible
storms
but
what
makes
you
think
that
i
always
go
it
alone
insisted
phil
that
i
never
have
any
one
to
protect
that
what
you
seem
to
insinuate
he
was
looking
directly
into
her
eyes
laughingly
teasingly
and
a
wave
of
color
swept
over
her
face
roberta
would
have
evaded
the
question
and
turned
it
off
with
a
laugh
mary
was
too
simple
and
direct
it
was
the
moment
she
had
long
felt
must
confront
her
some
time
her
day
of
reckoning
had
come
for
playing
eavesdropper
no
matter
how
hard
she
fought
against
doing
so
she
knew
she
was
going
to
confess
that
she
had
been
one
albeit
unintentionally
as
he
repeated
his
question
with
smiling
insistence
the
words
stuck
in
her
throat
but
the
thought
uppermost
in
her
mind
called
out
to
him
by
some
strange
telepathic
power
and
he
understood
as
if
she
had
spoken
you
think
he
said
slowly
looking
into
her
eyes
as
if
the
written
words
were
actually
before
him
there
and
he
was
reading
them
aloud
you
think
that
it
is
on
lloyd
account
how
did
you
know
about
it
startled
her
so
that
he
should
read
her
thought
in
such
a
way
that
she
could
only
stammer
in
reply
i
i
heard
you
singing
to
her
once
at
the
locusts
that
song
you
sang
last
night
the
stars
are
old
and
i
thought
if
you
cared
for
her
as
it
sounded
both
times
that
there
be
anybody
else
phil
turned
partly
away
from
her
and
stared
off
towards
the
hills
a
moment
his
eyes
narrowed
into
a
thoughtful
musing
expression
finally
he
said
i
thought
so
too
mary
once
i
thought
it
for
a
number
of
years
that
time
will
always
be
one
of
the
sweetest
and
most
sacred
of
my
memories
one
earliest
love
always
is
they
say
like
the
first
white
violet
in
the
spring
there
was
a
long
pause
then
he
finished
the
sentence
by
turning
around
to
her
to
say
significantly
but
there
always
a
summer
after
every
spring
you
know
come
on
we
better
be
getting
aboard
again
it
looks
as
if
they
about
ready
to
start
he
helped
her
up
the
steps
and
followed
her
down
the
aisle
while
adjusting
the
before
she
took
her
seat
he
began
to
talk
of
other
things
and
the
subject
was
dropped
between
them
but
it
was
not
dropped
in
mary
mind
she
had
been
called
on
to
adjust
herself
to
a
new
viewpoint
of
him
so
quickly
that
it
left
her
mentally
gasping
with
his
own
hand
he
had
ruthlessly
swept
away
one
of
her
dearest
illusions
she
had
always
believed
that
no
matter
who
else
might
forget
would
always
stand
as
a
model
of
manly
constancy
what
surprised
her
now
was
not
his
change
of
view
it
was
her
own
by
that
one
sentence
he
had
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
her
that
it
was
not
reasonable
to
expect
him
to
go
on
mourning
always
for
the
first
white
violet
it
was
only
natural
that
summer
should
follow
the
spring
but
the
puzzle
now
was
who
was
good
enough
and
sweet
and
high
and
fine
enough
to
follow
lloyd
mary
was
positive
that
there
was
nobody
he
might
hunt
the
whole
world
over
but
she
was
sure
he
would
be
doomed
to
disappointment
in
the
end
her
motherly
concern
over
that
was
almost
as
great
as
her
sympathy
had
been
when
she
thought
of
him
as
doomed
to
carry
a
secret
sorrow
with
him
to
the
grave
after
that
the
conversation
was
not
so
personal
it
was
nearly
noon
when
they
reached
bauer
and
in
that
time
they
had
exchanged
views
on
enough
subjects
to
have
filled
an
encyclopædia
twice
after
that
they
talked
together
alone
the
first
time
was
when
they
went
out
in
the
boat
just
before
sunset
mary
wanted
him
to
see
fernbank
in
all
its
glory
of
fresh
april
greenness
with
the
little
waterfalls
splashing
their
fine
mist
over
the
walls
of
delicate
she
insisted
on
poling
the
boat
although
he
protested
that
it
made
him
uncomfortable
to
sit
still
and
see
her
doing
the
work
he
refused
to
go
at
all
until
she
compromised
by
saying
he
might
pole
on
the
way
back
it
is
work
she
insisted
it
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
i
have
and
about
the
only
one
i
had
in
this
benighted
place
you
always
did
love
to
your
own
canoe
and
strike
out
and
do
things
for
yourself
he
remarked
as
they
shot
swiftly
up
the
stream
by
the
way
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
will
you
be
starting
back
to
warwick
hall
again
in
september
now
that
jack
is
sure
of
taking
his
old
position
in
the
mines
then
no
was
her
decided
answer
we
scrapped
about
that
a
lot
lately
he
insists
that
i
must
but
it
this
way
he
lost
a
whole
year
out
of
his
life
and
although
he
never
said
so
i
know
the
time
is
coming
when
he
want
to
settle
down
and
have
a
home
of
his
own
and
the
kind
who
never
ask
a
girl
to
marry
him
until
he
provided
for
her
future
in
case
anything
should
happen
to
him
joyce
plans
have
been
put
back
a
year
too
she
has
her
heart
set
on
going
to
paris
with
miss
henrietta
to
study
just
as
soon
as
she
can
afford
it
of
course
jack
will
pay
back
his
part
of
what
she
spent
on
us
this
winter
but
it
will
take
a
good
while
for
him
to
do
it
i
made
up
my
mind
i
not
going
to
stand
in
their
way
i
not
be
a
drag
on
either
one
of
them
there
lots
of
things
that
i
can
do
the
summer
is
already
provided
for
when
mallory
found
that
we
are
going
to
stay
on
here
till
september
till
jack
is
strong
enough
to
go
back
to
work
she
made
up
her
mind
to
stay
too
no
matter
how
hot
it
gets
because
the
children
are
so
happy
here
they
ca
bear
the
idea
of
stopping
their
lessons
they
beginning
to
learn
to
read
now
and
are
as
wild
over
that
as
if
it
were
a
new
game
rochester
says
it
does
get
frightfully
hot
here
in
the
summers
but
that
we
can
stand
it
if
we
have
the
lessons
in
the
morning
instead
of
afternoon
and
then
asked
phil
after
that
after
that
i
do
know
but
there
be
something
it
all
uncertain
but
it
interesting
just
to
wonder
what
will
come
next
i
like
the
wolf
in
the
last
of
the
mowgli
stories
she
turned
to
glance
over
her
shoulder
as
she
quoted
laughingly
stars
are
thin
said
gray
brother
sniffing
at
the
dawn
wind
shall
we
lair
for
from
now
we
follow
new
i
know
where
the
new
trails
will
lead
but
from
all
that
happened
in
the
past
i
faith
to
believe
that
there
be
hunting
in
them
there
will
always
be
that
for
you
said
phil
warmly
you
never
strike
one
where
you
not
find
friends
and
interests
and
he
started
to
say
more
but
checked
himself
and
after
an
pause
stood
up
almost
upsetting
the
boat
and
laughingly
took
the
oar
away
from
her
insisting
that
he
could
sit
still
another
minute
he
had
to
work
off
some
of
his
surplus
energy
what
he
had
come
near
saying
when
he
checked
himself
was
and
never
strike
a
trail
where
you
wo
be
the
bravest
jolliest
dearest
little
comrade
a
man
could
have
one
that
he
would
never
tire
of
one
who
could
inspire
him
to
do
and
be
his
best
the
impulse
to
say
all
this
came
upon
him
so
suddenly
that
it
startled
him
then
a
sober
second
thought
told
him
that
after
all
she
was
scarcely
more
than
a
child
that
she
had
always
looked
upon
him
as
an
elderly
brother
and
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
destroy
that
old
intimate
relationship
until
he
was
sure
of
being
able
to
establish
a
new
one
a
strange
feeling
of
humility
took
possession
of
him
it
suddenly
seemed
that
he
had
so
little
to
offer
one
who
could
give
so
much
even
her
opinion
which
he
had
laughed
at
at
the
stone
quarry
about
providing
a
financial
umbrella
carried
weight
now
and
made
him
hesitate
no
longer
confidant
of
himself
his
strong
quick
sweeps
of
the
oar
sent
the
boat
upstream
at
twice
the
speed
it
had
been
going
before
and
mary
from
her
seat
in
the
stern
called
out
that
it
was
as
good
as
flying
and
that
she
have
to
acknowledge
that
she
never
known
before
how
delightful
it
was
to
sit
still
and
let
somebody
else
do
the
paddling
but
that
was
because
nobody
else
had
taken
her
along
so
fast
at
fernbank
they
did
not
get
out
of
the
boat
phil
took
the
seat
facing
her
while
they
drifted
around
the
deep
pool
for
a
little
while
it
was
almost
twilight
there
for
the
high
bank
shut
out
the
glow
of
the
sunset
and
it
was
deliciously
cool
and
green
and
still
presently
some
remark
of
phil
made
mary
exclaim
that
reminds
me
although
i
do
know
why
it
should
of
something
i
been
intending
to
tell
you
that
joyce
wrote
recently
you
heard
her
talk
of
little
jules
ciseaux
the
boy
who
played
such
an
important
part
in
her
winter
in
france
he
lived
in
the
house
with
the
giant
scissors
on
the
gables
and
over
the
great
gate
you
know
well
over
here
in
america
now
he
always
wanted
to
come
ever
since
joyce
told
him
so
much
about
it
his
mother
was
an
american
and
i
think
he
was
born
in
this
country
at
any
rate
he
here
now
sightseeing
and
trying
to
hunt
up
his
mother
family
he
come
into
quite
a
large
fortune
lately
ever
so
many
hundred
thousand
francs
as
he
is
of
age
he
can
do
as
he
pleases
joyce
says
he
wants
to
come
out
to
lone
rock
to
see
us
because
she
used
to
entertain
him
by
the
hour
with
tales
of
us
and
he
used
to
envy
us
our
good
times
together
in
the
little
brown
house
at
plainsville
he
never
knew
any
home
life
like
ours
i
wild
to
see
him
joyce
says
he
is
charming
such
lovely
manners
and
such
a
sensitive
refined
face
like
ideal
of
a
young
poet
he
really
something
of
an
artist
joyce
says
he
done
some
really
creditable
work
and
all
her
friends
have
taken
him
up
and
are
making
it
nice
for
him
while
he
is
in
new
york
that
interesting
said
phil
i
look
him
up
as
soon
as
i
get
back
would
it
be
romantic
if
the
friendship
that
started
between
them
as
children
should
grow
into
something
more
all
those
inherited
francs
would
provide
the
fine
large
umbrella
which
you
seem
to
think
is
necessary
oh
it
never
can
be
anything
but
friendship
in
this
case
exclaimed
mary
jules
is
two
years
younger
than
joyce
by
the
same
token
he
is
three
years
older
than
you
maybe
it
little
sister
he
will
be
taking
an
interest
in
humph
you
as
bad
as
norman
replied
mary
calmly
that
what
said
he
thought
he
had
something
new
to
tease
me
about
but
he
soon
found
out
that
it
would
work
despite
her
indifference
phil
thought
of
the
possibility
again
many
times
that
night
before
he
fell
asleep
knowing
the
limited
space
of
the
cottage
he
had
taken
a
room
at
the
williams
house
despite
protests
saying
he
would
be
over
early
in
the
morning
for
breakfast
but
it
seemed
for
awhile
that
would
arrive
before
he
could
fall
asleep
things
assume
formidable
proportions
in
the
darkness
and
dead
quiet
of
the
night
that
they
never
have
by
day
away
after
midnight
he
was
still
thinking
of
what
mary
had
said
about
the
young
frenchman
who
had
lately
come
into
his
fortune
and
of
what
roberta
had
said
about
lieutenant
boglin
the
face
of
the
latter
rose
up
before
him
not
a
particularly
face
he
thought
but
it
was
a
strong
likable
one
and
he
had
a
sense
of
humor
which
made
him
good
company
and
a
turn
of
the
tongue
that
would
take
with
any
girl
as
for
jules
ciseaux
who
had
envied
the
wares
their
home
life
phil
knew
all
about
the
childhood
of
the
lonely
little
lad
left
to
the
mercies
of
a
brutal
caretaker
jules
would
only
need
to
see
mary
once
dear
little
that
she
was
to
want
to
carry
her
away
with
him
to
his
chateau
beside
the
loire
before
phil
finally
fell
asleep
he
had
decided
just
what
he
would
say
to
mary
next
morning
and
that
he
would
go
early
enough
to
make
an
opportunity
to
say
it
it
early
when
he
went
striding
down
the
road
across
the
and
took
the
short
cut
through
a
meadow
to
the
back
of
the
ware
cottage
but
the
preparations
for
breakfast
were
well
under
way
when
he
reached
the
back
porch
screened
by
vines
he
saw
the
table
set
out
there
with
fresh
strawberries
at
each
place
wreathed
in
their
own
green
leaves
judging
from
the
odors
wafted
through
the
door
chickens
were
broiling
within
to
exactly
the
right
degree
of
delectable
crispness
and
coffee
which
would
be
of
amber
clearness
was
in
the
making
but
the
noises
within
the
kitchen
were
not
to
be
interpreted
as
easily
as
the
odors
there
was
a
banging
and
scuffling
over
the
floor
muffled
shrieks
and
broken
sentences
in
high
voices
choking
with
laughter
not
till
he
reached
the
open
window
and
looked
in
could
he
imagine
the
cause
of
the
uproar
norman
and
mary
were
wrestling
and
romping
all
over
the
kitchen
having
a
over
something
he
was
trying
to
take
away
from
her
unconscious
of
a
spectator
they
dragged
each
other
around
bumping
against
walls
amid
a
clatter
of
falling
tinware
stumbling
over
chairs
and
coming
to
a
deadlock
in
each
others
arms
in
a
corner
so
full
of
laughter
they
could
scarcely
hold
their
grip
dare
me
again
will
you
gasped
norman
thinking
he
had
her
pinned
to
the
wall
but
wrenching
one
hand
free
she
began
to
tickle
him
until
he
writhed
away
from
her
with
a
whoop
and
dashed
out
of
the
door
yah
cat
she
jeered
after
him
afraid
of
a
tickle
you
just
wait
till
i
get
back
with
the
milk
he
cried
catching
up
a
shining
tin
pail
that
stood
on
the
bench
and
starting
down
the
path
over
which
phil
had
just
come
illustration
mary
ware
in
texas
well
i
going
away
and
i
may
not
see
you
again
you
have
to
hurry
she
called
after
him
breakfast
is
almost
ready
she
stooped
to
open
the
oven
door
and
peep
at
the
pan
of
biscuit
within
just
beginning
to
turn
a
delicate
brown
then
she
looked
up
and
caught
sight
of
phil
he
was
leaning
against
the
window
looking
in
his
arms
crossed
on
the
sill
as
if
he
had
been
enjoying
the
spectacle
for
some
time
for
mercy
sakes
she
exclaimed
how
long
have
you
been
there
the
coast
was
clear
norman
was
well
on
his
way
to
the
metz
place
and
ware
was
helping
jack
get
ready
for
breakfast
it
was
as
good
an
opportunity
as
phil
could
have
hoped
for
to
repeat
the
speech
he
had
rehearsed
so
many
times
the
night
before
and
she
looked
so
fresh
and
wholesome
and
sweet
standing
there
in
her
pink
morning
dress
with
the
big
white
apron
that
she
was
more
like
an
than
anything
else
he
could
think
of
he
wanted
to
tell
her
so
to
tell
her
she
had
never
seemed
so
dear
and
desirable
as
she
did
at
this
moment
when
he
must
be
going
away
to
leave
her
yet
how
could
he
tell
her
when
she
was
all
and
and
aglow
from
her
romp
with
norman
clearly
she
was
too
far
from
his
state
of
mind
to
share
it
now
or
even
to
understand
it
after
all
she
was
only
a
little
girl
at
heart
only
eighteen
it
was
fair
to
her
to
awaken
her
quite
yet
to
hurry
her
into
giving
a
promise
when
she
could
possibly
know
her
own
mind
he
would
wait
so
he
only
leaned
on
the
and
laughed
at
her
for
having
been
caught
in
such
an
undignified
romp
and
asked
her
when
she
intended
to
grow
up
and
if
she
ever
expected
to
outgrow
her
propensity
for
scrapping
but
when
he
had
joked
thus
a
few
minutes
he
said
quite
suddenly
and
seriously
mary
i
want
you
to
promise
me
something
she
was
taking
the
chickens
from
the
broiler
and
did
not
look
at
him
until
they
were
safely
landed
in
the
hot
platter
awaiting
them
but
she
said
lightly
yes
your
to
the
of
me
kingdom
wot
is
it
well
i
going
away
and
i
may
not
see
you
again
for
a
long
time
the
chief
wants
me
to
take
a
position
engineering
the
construction
of
a
big
dam
down
in
mexico
it
would
keep
me
down
there
two
years
but
it
would
be
the
biggest
thing
i
had
yet
in
every
way
last
night
i
just
about
made
up
my
mind
i
take
it
while
i
gone
you
will
be
striking
out
into
all
sorts
of
new
trails
and
i
am
afraid
that
on
some
of
them
somebody
will
come
along
and
try
to
persuade
you
to
join
him
on
his
even
if
you
are
such
a
little
girl
now
i
want
to
have
a
hand
in
choosing
the
right
man
and
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
wo
let
anybody
persuade
you
to
do
that
till
i
come
back
or
at
least
if
they
do
try
that
you
send
me
word
that
they
trying
and
give
me
a
chance
to
come
back
and
have
a
look
at
the
fellow
and
see
if
i
think
he
is
good
enough
to
carry
you
off
why
the
idea
she
laughed
a
trifle
embarrassed
but
immensely
pleased
that
he
should
think
it
possible
for
her
to
have
numerous
suitors
or
to
have
them
soon
and
flattered
that
he
should
take
enough
interest
in
her
future
to
want
to
be
called
back
from
mexico
to
direct
her
choice
but
will
you
promise
he
urged
yes
that
is
not
much
to
promise
and
you
give
me
your
hand
on
it
he
persisted
yes
and
cross
my
heart
and
body
in
the
bargain
she
added
lightly
if
that
please
you
any
better
for
all
his
gravity
she
thought
he
was
jesting
until
she
reached
her
hand
through
the
window
to
seal
the
compact
you
know
he
said
as
his
warm
fingers
closed
over
it
i
never
yet
seen
anybody
whom
i
considered
good
enough
for
little
mary
ware
her
eyes
fell
before
the
seriousness
of
his
steady
glance
and
she
turned
away
all
in
a
flutter
of
pleasure
that
the
best
man
should
have
said
such
a
lovely
thing
about
it
was
the
very
thing
she
had
always
thought
about
him
ware
came
out
just
then
wheeling
jack
in
his
chair
and
soon
after
norman
was
back
with
the
milk
and
breakfast
was
served
out
on
the
porch
among
the
a
perfect
breakfast
and
a
perfect
morning
phil
said
the
which
was
to
call
for
him
came
while
they
were
still
lingering
around
the
table
and
there
was
only
time
for
a
hasty
all
around
come
and
walk
out
to
the
gate
with
me
mary
and
give
me
a
good
he
said
hurriedly
snatching
up
his
now
in
this
last
moment
when
there
was
much
to
say
neither
had
a
word
and
they
walked
along
in
silence
until
they
reached
the
gate
there
he
turned
for
one
more
remember
your
promise
he
said
gravely
as
his
fingers
closed
warmly
over
hers
i
meant
every
word
i
said
i
remember
she
answered
dimpling
again
as
if
he
had
reminded
her
of
a
good
joke
and
i
keep
my
word
honest
i
will
with
that
he
went
away
carrying
with
him
a
picture
which
he
recalled
a
thousand
times
in
the
months
that
followed
mary
standing
at
the
gate
in
the
pink
and
white
dress
that
had
the
freshness
of
a
spring
blossom
with
her
sweet
sincere
eyes
and
her
dear
little
mouth
saying
keep
my
word
honest
i
will
it
was
a
long
long
hot
summer
that
followed
the
drought
dried
up
the
creek
so
that
the
boat
lay
idle
on
the
bank
the
dust
grew
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
roads
and
lay
thick
on
the
wayside
weeds
even
the
trees
were
powdered
with
it
all
the
green
of
the
landscape
took
on
an
ashen
grayness
meadows
lay
parched
and
sere
walking
ceased
to
be
a
pleasure
and
as
they
gasped
through
the
tropical
heat
of
the
endless
afternoons
they
longed
for
the
dense
shade
of
the
pines
at
lone
rock
and
counted
the
days
till
they
could
go
back
but
as
soon
as
the
sun
dropped
behind
the
hills
each
day
and
the
breeze
started
up
from
the
gulf
their
discomfort
was
forgotten
in
the
wonderful
brilliance
of
the
starry
nights
when
there
was
no
moon
or
in
the
times
when
one
hung
like
a
luminous
pearl
above
a
silver
world
the
air
grew
fresh
and
cool
and
they
sat
late
in
the
open
making
the
most
of
every
minute
in
the
early
mornings
there
was
that
same
crisp
freshness
of
the
hills
again
so
one
could
endure
the
merciless
yellow
glare
and
the
panting
heat
of
the
afternoons
for
the
sake
of
the
nights
and
dawns
even
without
that
however
they
would
have
been
content
to
stay
on
enduring
it
gladly
for
jack
was
daily
growing
stronger
and
to
see
him
moving
about
the
house
on
his
own
feet
no
matter
how
falteringly
at
first
was
a
cause
for
hourly
rejoicing
mary
still
played
the
part
of
baloo
with
brud
and
sister
starting
early
in
the
morning
and
taking
them
over
to
the
old
in
the
shade
of
some
big
cypress
and
sycamore
trees
she
was
teaching
them
to
read
and
write
but
there
was
little
poring
over
books
for
them
they
built
their
letters
out
of
stones
and
fashioned
whole
sentences
of
twigs
wrote
them
in
the
sand
and
modelled
them
in
mud
scratched
them
on
rocks
with
bits
of
flint
as
indians
do
their
picture
language
and
pricked
them
in
the
broad
sycamore
leaves
with
thorns
by
the
end
of
the
summer
they
had
enough
of
a
vocabulary
to
write
a
brief
letter
to
their
father
and
their
pride
knew
no
bounds
when
each
had
achieved
one
entirely
alone
from
date
to
stamp
and
dropped
it
into
the
box
at
the
his
pride
in
them
was
equally
great
and
the
letter
that
he
sent
mary
with
her
final
check
was
one
of
the
few
things
which
she
carried
away
from
texas
as
a
cherished
memento
she
did
not
write
often
in
her
good
times
book
there
was
so
little
to
chronicle
an
occasional
visit
from
the
barnaby
a
call
at
the
rectory
a
few
minutes
spent
in
neighborly
gossip
in
the
metz
garden
never
once
in
the
whole
summer
a
happening
more
exciting
than
that
except
when
the
troops
from
fort
sam
houston
were
ordered
out
on
their
annual
hike
and
passed
through
bauer
in
july
each
of
the
different
divisions
camped
a
day
and
a
night
in
the
grove
back
of
the
cottage
near
enough
for
the
wares
to
watch
every
manoeuvre
the
artillery
band
played
at
sunset
when
it
was
in
camp
and
gave
a
concert
that
night
in
the
plaza
when
the
cavalry
passed
through
lieutenant
boglin
came
to
supper
and
spent
the
evening
gay
was
up
for
a
day
twice
and
mary
went
once
to
san
antonio
that
was
all
yet
stupid
as
it
was
for
a
girl
of
her
age
and
much
as
she
missed
young
companionship
mary
managed
to
get
through
the
summer
very
happily
all
its
unpleasantness
was
atoned
for
one
day
in
early
september
when
she
looked
out
to
see
jack
going
down
the
road
straight
and
strong
pushing
his
own
wheeled
chair
in
front
of
him
he
was
taking
it
down
to
doctor
mackay
office
to
leave
for
the
first
poor
devil
who
needs
it
he
said
in
the
last
few
weeks
he
had
discovered
what
he
had
not
known
before
that
the
town
was
full
of
invalids
in
quest
of
health
attracted
from
all
over
the
country
by
the
air
of
its
hills
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
number
of
them
since
he
had
been
able
to
ride
around
with
the
doctor
now
as
he
went
off
down
the
road
with
the
chair
with
all
of
the
family
at
the
window
to
see
the
happy
sight
ware
repeated
to
mary
what
the
doctor
had
said
about
jack
effect
on
his
other
patients
and
what
the
rector
had
told
her
of
the
regard
all
the
villagers
had
for
jack
the
dear
boy
year
of
suffering
has
done
one
thing
for
the
world
she
added
it
has
given
it
another
aldebaran
do
you
remember
in
jester
she
quoted
it
readily
because
ever
since
she
had
first
seen
it
she
had
always
read
jack
name
in
place
of
aldebaran
came
to
pass
whenever
he
went
by
men
felt
a
strange
influence
radiating
from
his
presence
a
sense
of
hope
one
could
not
say
exactly
what
it
was
it
was
so
fleeting
so
intangible
like
warmth
that
circles
from
a
brazier
or
perfume
that
is
wafted
from
an
unseen
that
what
one
feels
whenever
jack
comes
near
yes
i
know
assented
mary
even
old
metz
tried
to
say
as
much
to
me
about
him
he
did
choose
those
words
of
course
but
in
his
own
broken
way
he
meant
the
same
thing
when
the
day
came
to
leave
there
was
no
one
to
go
with
them
to
the
station
the
rochesters
were
away
on
their
vacation
and
it
was
too
early
in
the
morning
for
the
barnabys
to
come
in
from
the
ranch
they
had
bidden
each
other
the
day
before
with
deep
regrets
on
both
sides
it
seemed
so
good
to
both
mary
and
her
mother
to
see
jack
attending
to
the
tickets
and
the
trunks
in
his
old
way
so
quick
and
capable
while
he
was
getting
the
checks
mary
walked
down
the
track
a
little
piece
to
a
place
where
she
could
look
back
at
the
town
for
one
more
picture
to
carry
away
in
her
memory
how
friendly
and
homelike
and
dear
it
seemed
now
between
the
belfry
of
peter
and
the
gray
tower
of
holy
angels
rose
the
smoke
from
many
breakfast
fires
and
the
windmills
twirled
merrily
in
the
morning
sun
for
all
its
dreariness
she
was
carrying
away
the
recollection
of
a
score
of
happy
times
over
there
was
the
free
where
their
little
christmas
tree
had
spread
such
cheer
further
on
shone
the
spire
of
boniface
she
would
always
think
of
it
as
she
saw
it
easter
morning
its
casement
windows
set
wide
and
its
altar
white
with
the
snowy
beauty
of
the
rain
lilies
there
was
the
meadow
through
which
she
had
gone
in
time
to
find
phil
waiting
under
the
tree
and
there
the
creek
running
on
to
fernbank
nearer
by
she
could
see
the
windmill
tower
she
had
so
often
climbed
sticking
up
over
the
roof
that
had
sheltered
them
during
the
ten
months
they
had
been
in
bauer
dear
little
old
bauer
she
thought
gratefully
she
would
have
believed
it
in
the
beginning
if
anyone
had
told
her
that
there
would
be
any
regrets
in
her
when
the
time
came
to
go
how
wonderfully
it
had
all
turned
out
the
crooked
been
made
straight
and
the
rough
places
smooth
she
could
face
the
future
gladly
buoyantly
now
no
matter
what
it
held
since
jack
was
well
again
come
on
mary
it

called
norman

she
called
back

come

children
i
must
wait
to
speak
to
them
she
had
bidden
them
the
night
before
and
had
not
expected
to
see
them
again
they
came
running
out
of
breath
sister

a
little
bag
of
animal
crackers
she
had
brought
as
a
farewell
offering
and
brud
proffered
a
a
sack
of
sticky
red
cinnamon
drops
they
had
cried
the
night
before
and
they
were
close
to
tears
now
realizing
that
something
very
rare
and
precious
was
passing
out
of
their
lives
she
took
their
offerings
with
thanks
that
brought
smiles
to
their
dejected
little
faces
then
once
more
stooped
to

them
from

on
