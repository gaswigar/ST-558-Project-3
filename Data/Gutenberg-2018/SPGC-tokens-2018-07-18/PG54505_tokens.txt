lyrics
the
poems
contained
in
the
following
pages
must
be
taken
as
parts
of
a
whole
being
intended
to
be
distinct
only
in
their
subjects
this
will
account
for
the
same
measure
being
used
throughout
of
these
pieces
the
only
one
which
has
been
previously
published
is
that
addressed
to
a
wild
flower
my
reason
for
inserting
it
here
is
that
it
harmonizes
with
the
other
poems
and
having
been
already
favourably
spoken
of
by
competent
judges
i
must
confess
it
is
one
which
i
should
not
willingly
let
die
in
the
first
poem
on
autumn
i
have
introduced
what
has
always
appeared
to
me
a
beautiful
incident
in
nature
namely
the
singing
of
the
during
a
the
louder
the
thunder
roars
the
shriller
and
sweeter
becomes
its
voice
this
interesting
little
bird
is
popularly
known
by
the
name
of
the
because
he
is
supposed
to
sing
boldest
immediately
previous
to
a
storm
but
that
he
also
sends
forth
his
native
wood
notes
wild
during
its
continuance
is
a
fact
which
has
been
satisfactorily
ascertained
undismayed
by
the
tempest
fury
or
rather
rejoicing
in
its
violence
the
small
but
spirited
songster
warbles
on
unceasingly
as
if
desirous
of
emulating
the
loudness
of
the
or
of
making
his
song
be
heard
above
the
noise
of
the
raging
elements
the
poetry
of
nature
particularly
at
this
joyous
season
is
in
its
landscapes
and
if
these
unpretending
lyrics
should
lead
any
one
to
a
healthy
contemplation
of
natural
objects
or
impart
to
refined
minds
any
pleasure
in
the
perusal
the
time
which

radiant

its

for

a

brightness
brings

vapour
from
the

the

begins

from
off
the

the

the

all

in
its
varied

mingle
their
beauties
there
the
ripple
of
the

beachward
returning
to
the
distant

like
a
lone
pilgrim
to
the
cottage
door
that
once
a
welcome
gave
the

on
the

its

with

glee
the

of

things

of

sunbeam
plays

birds
telling
all
sleepers

and
with
reviving
nature
haste
to
pay
their
homage
not
in

the
dreamy
waterfall
babbling
and
bubbling
from
the
upland
spring
the
soaring
crag
where
eaglets
rest
their
wing
listening
the
eagle
call
the
minstrel
streamlet
near
the
zephyr
breath
too
languid
for
a
breeze
that
stirs
yet
scarcely
moves
the
gentle
trees
touching
the
waters
clear
the
sunrays
as
they
pass
into
broad
sunshine
throw
their
light
on
all
with
bloom
and
blossom
they
fall
on
mount
or
and
something
more
than
light
sleeps
on
the
verdant
dreams
of
love
and
glimpses
of
the
happier
state
above
burst
on
the
mental
sight
no
morning
further
advanced
meet
is
to
watch
and
spy
the
laughing
orient
like
a
chubby
child
bringing
new
joyousness
to
wood
and
wild
to
ocean
earth
and
sky
the
groups
of
early
flowers
to
th
enamoured
sun
their
bosoms
ope
apt
emblems
of
the
welcome
birth
of
hope
in
life
oft
darkened
bowers
pass
to
the
green
and
let
us
wander
where
the
wild
flowers
grow
gaze
on
the
sedgy
stream
calm
depths
below
where
gentle
minnows
glide
the
sheltered
cuckoo
notes
in
the
young
sunshine
echo
on
the
ear
a
moving
voice
from
all
around
is
here
hymns
from
a
thousand
throats
the
spirit
grows
the
more
refined
and
holy
as
we
stand
and
gaze
upon
the
landscape
brightening
in
the
blaze
that
gilds
both
land
and
shore
all
objects
far
and
near
the
light
of
morn
illumines
it
is
now
that
man
can
walk
erect
with
glowing
brow
and
heart
devoid
of
fear
and
lo
there
is
a
stir
in
yonder
village
bosomed
in
the
dell
like
a
meek
babe
loved
by
its
mother
well
and
loving
nought
but
her
where
claims
the
eye
to
rest
earth
has
a
balmy
look
and
so
has
heaven
and
thoughts
like
mazy
clouds
through
ether
driven
float
in
th
enraptured
breast
the
sylvan
haunts
where
youth
roams
fancy
led
all
glorious
in
their
hue
the
quaint
sequestered
spots
and
paths
we
view
where
age
consorts
with
truth
read
we
of
aught
that
wakes
high
inspiration
in
the
soul
in
scenes
like
these
the
tufted
trees
fantastic
tapestries
romantic
knolls
and
brakes
the
glen
where
bound
the
wild
deer
and
the
huntsman
horn
sounds
from
afar
a
welcome
to
the
morn
till
echo
sounds
again
and
more
than
all
the
old
and
pyramidal
mountains
that
with
time
have
stood
defying
change
and
storm
and
clime
as
none
else
of
earth
mould
hath
done
the
sun
embrowns
but
does
not
scorch
them
rain
and
wind
and
snow
renew
them
not
destroy
no
waste
they
know
but
lasting
glory
crowns
still
to
the
heart
endeared
are
sights
like
this
we
gaze
on
do
we
deem
that
they
are
other
than
a
privileged
dream
one
that
the
mind
has
reared
no
noonday
lo
like
an
eastern
king
forth
marches
sunshine
gorgeously
through
earth
by
health
attended
and
mirth
and
heralded
by
spring
light
through
the
untrack
air
pursues
its
course
authentic
hill
and
dale
rejoice
and
nature
cries
all
hail
as
if
a
king
were
there
the
elevated
lawns
where
first
the
day
comes
and
where
last
retires
rejoicing
seem
their
light
the
mind
inspires
and
thought
like
morning
dawns
the
wild
yet
artless
breeze
now
in
the
ear
of
nature
sings
its
song
wandering
green
fields
and
flowery
banks
among
and
over
shadowy
seas
soft
falls
the
sunlight
down
on
the
old
castle
that
above
the
dell
stands
in
its
glory
lone
as
if
to
tell
some
tale
of
past
renown
the
hamlet
in
the
vale
the
church
beside
the
stream
that
winds
remote
among
the
hills
the
boat
that
midway
hoists
its
sail
a
scene
like
this
is
rife
with
pleasurable
feelings
as
with
grace
perhaps
we
here
instructively
may
trace
some
simile
of
life
the
grey
and
steadfast
hills
tell
of
the
old
immortals
of
past
time
and
looking
downward
beauty
in
its
prime
the
heart
with
rapture
fills
the
deer
descend
together
from
the
uplands
while
the
sprouting
grass
puts
forth
a
pleasant
smile
as
if
to
tempt
them
near
the
sinless
flowers
away
in
the
far
inward
forest
paths
bestrown
are
yet
not
solitary
though
alone
none
are
so
glad
as
they
the
comely
violets
their
open
and
the
sunshine
seek
the
pastures
fresh
their
grateful
homage
speak
untinctured
with
regrets
the
virgin
rose
assumes
a
bridal
bearing
as
if
noonday
came
with
brighter
countenance
its
love
to
claim
and
revel
its
blooms
the
prattle
of
the
brook
the
lazy
clouds
that
hung
in
middle
sky
exulting
in
the
balm
float
listless
by
reflecting
back
their
look
the
buds
the
herbs
the
leaves
each
and
all
things
that
blossom
bless
the
rays
of
the
bright
sun
and
as
they
bless
they
praise
the
bounteous
hand
that
gives
no
the
sunbeam
now
glory
walks
abroad
and
on
the
quiet
unassuming
stream
and
on
the
hills
gently
its
beam
all
lovely
is
bestowed
the
day
the
far
mead
in
virgin
radiance
comes
while
the
bee
jubilant
its
welcome
hums
and
passes
on
its
way
the
lily
in
its
bloom
of
the
lone
valley
where
the
breezes
sing
of
love
beside
the
spring
and
perfume
and
beauty
without
guile
it
pictures
dreams
of
in
the
bounding
breast
and
vows
and
unions
that
are
blest
and
childhood
fairy
smile
the
mountain
verdant
side
where
visioned
poesy
delights
to
show
the
sights
of
heaven
to
gentle
minds
below
the
in
its
pride
the
broken
branch
on
which
the
leans
while
far
aloof
his
bounding
charge
rest
th
adventurous
hoof
where
man
foot
dare
not
tread
the
cushat
in
the
wood
where
the
laburnum
and
the
lilac
grow
the
placid
rill
wandering
away
below
as
one
for
earth
too
good
the
paths
remote
that
lead
to
lone
retreats
and
leafy
cells
where
like
a
bashful
fay
the
fancy
dwells
and
thought
the
vintage
and
its
cheer
the
peasant
and
maid
the
festooned
village

in

to
charm
th
expectant
ear
the

the

track
the
smile

back
the
primrose
on
a
grave
the
berry
purple
shine
and
lustrous
scattered
the
waste
the
sprinkled
healthful
the
patriarchal
pine
the
memories
of
all
telling
of
pleasures
rare
and
jocund
ease
in
joyousness
yea
more
than
these
the
sunbeam
does
recall
the
hope
of
life
above
rich
buds
of
promise
springing
everywhere
the
gifts
that
come
without
our
care
from
love
no
to
a
wild
flower
in
what
delightful
land
flower
didst
thou
attain
thy
birth
thou
art
no
offspring
of
the
common
earth
by
common
breezes
fanned
full
oft
my
gladdened
eye
in
pleasant
glade
on
river
marge
has
traced
as
if
there
planted
by
the
hand
of
taste
sweet
flowers
of
every
dye
but
never
did
i
see
in
mead
or
mountain
or
domestic
bower
many
a
lovely
and
delicious
flower
one
half
so
fair
as
thee
thy
beauty
makes
rejoice
my
inmost
i
know
not
how
is
so
fancies
thou
dost
make
me
know
for
fragrance
is
thy
voice
and
still
it
comes
to
me
in
quiet
night
and
turmoil
of
the
day
like
memory
of
friends
gone
far
away
or
haply
ceased
to
be
together
we
commune
as
lovers
do
when
standing
all
apart
no
one
the
whispers
of
their
heart
save
the
moon
thy
thoughts
i
can
divine
although
not
uttered
in
words
thou
me
of
songs
of
forest
birds
of
venerable
wine
of
earth
fresh
shrubs
and
roots
of
summer
days
when
men
their
thirsting
slake
in
the
cool
fountain
or
the
cooler
lake
while
eating
fruits
thy
leaves
my
memory
tell
of
sights
and
scents
and
sounds
that
come
again
like
ocean
murmurs
when
the
balmy
strain
is
echoed
in
its
shell
the
meadows
in
their
green
waters
in
the
ways
the
forest
where
the
hermit
prays
in
thy
fair
face
are
seen
thy
home
is
in
the
wild
sylvan
shades
near
springs
where
peace
dwells
all
apart
from
earthly
things
like
some
secluded
child
the
beauty
of
the
sky
the
music
of
the
woods
the
love
that
stirs
wherever
nature
charms
her
worshippers
are
all
by
thee
brought
nigh
i
shall
not
soon
forget
what
thou
hast
taught
me
in
my
solitude
my
feelings
have
acquired
a
taste
of
good
sweet
flower
since
first
we
met
thou
unto
the
soul
a
blessing
and
a
peace
inspiring
thought
and
dost
the
goodness
and
the
power
denote
of
him
who
formed
the
whole
no
summer
is
so
near
and
we
not
know
of
it
oh
dull
and
dead
must
be
the
heart
the
passions
cold
as
lead
that
find
no
beauty
here
fresh
th
awakened
earth
now
all
the
glories
of
the
summer
shine
and
nature
as
if
drunk
with
olden
wine
is
laughing
in
its
mirth
and
melodies
are
heard
from
far
and
near
and
sounds
that
stir
the
heart
sweeter
than
fancy
dreams
of
when
slow
art
to
rival
them
has
erred
all
things
become
more
pure
and
hallowed
to
the
view
the
very
flowers
seem
smiling
in
a
world
more
rich
than
ours
a
more
secure
the
berry
of
the
wood
blooms
with
new
lustre
the
golden
ray
of
the
warm
sunshine
resting
by
the
way
where
the
green
forests
brood
the
old
and
reverend
trees
and
clustering
thickets
now
are
gladly
sought
by
him
who
from
the
heat
would
stray
remote
and
rest
his
limbs
at
ease
the
smell
of
hay
revives
the
heart
like
as
at
evening
time
we
love
to
listen
to
the
tinkling
chime
of
far
away
and
lo
the
rustic
cot
on
the
smooth
margin
of
the
quiet
lake
where
wedded
love
and
pleased
content
partake
their
enviable
lot
where
daylong
may
be
seen
two
sister
swans
disporting
in
their
joy
the
happy
parents
with
their
reclining
on
the
green
decay
should
seem
unknown
but
spiteful
time
its
certain
change
prepares
light
has
its
shade
and
pleasure
has
its
cares
music
its

the

that
from

proceeds
how
beautiful
the

why
should
we
think
of
change
for
scenes
like
this

as
a

when

all

but
th

once
look
upon

like

upon
the

pain
that
brings
a
solace
nigh
in
after
years
rest
within
the

with
bloom

refreshing
to
the

down

bestowed

streaming
through

autumn
oh
with
what
a
zest
they
plunge

a
nest
or

far
and
near
how
oft
when
changeful
time
has
sprinkled
our
locks
its
silver
threads
remembrance
brings
to
mind
and
gladness
sheds
the
pastimes
of
our
prime
the
lowing
of
the
kine
in
distant
comes
on
the
ear
with
taste
of
nature
fresh
like
cheer
of
rustics
as
they
join
the
merry
dance
at
eve
each
rural
sound
has
in
it
joy
and
health
man
now
should
garner
thought
as
well
as
wealth
and
gladly
truth
receive
the
calm
and
picturesque
the
foliaged
cedar
and
the
wreathëd
beech
more
glowing

from
his
desk
no
autumn
in
its
second
aspect
now
autumn
mantle
brown
falls
on
the
woods
and
fields
the
leaves
are
sere
and
like
sad
offerings
to
the
rifled
year
they
drop
in
clusters
down
the
land
is
lone
and
bare
the
grateful
trees
themselves
of
leaves
divest
to
form
a
covering
for
earth
naked
breast
with
reverential
care
for
why
should
they
be
left
in
all
their
foliage
when
the
sunshine
grace
is
gone
from
off
the
hills
and
nature
face
is
of
its
charms
bereft
the
distance
grey
becomes
like
a
thin
thread
of
silver
long
drawn
out
but
hark
the
cheerful
tabor
and
the
shout
the
sound
of
merry
drums
now
sportive
by
vintagers
and
villagers
is
held
and
wine
and
ale
are
welled
like
water
at
the
foam
and
labourers
rejoice
that
fruits
of
field
and
orchard
all
are
housed
and
the
glad
song
of
thankfulness
is
roused
from
every
manly
voice
the
high
ancestral
hall
where
health
delights
to
dwell
and
generous
mirth
holds
when
the
corn
is
gathered
from
the
earth
a
grateful
festival
adorns
the
waning
scene
here
may
be
heard
when
in
a
musing
mood
the
cawing
of
the
old
rooks
in
the
wood
that
flanks
it
like
a
screen
is
there
not
much
to
cheer
in
the
glad
sounds
that
still
from
hill
and
vale
and
glen
remote
come
echoed
on
the
gale
to
greet
th
excited
ear
lo
the
changing
sward
sweep
now
the
huntsmen
in
the
rapid
chace
the
yell
of
hounds
mouthing
the
trace
of
the
fleet
deer
is
heard
in
lone
and
hoary
wood
where
the
wild
cherry
and
the
yellow
elm
commingled
with
the
oak
the
soul
with
visions
there
comes
a
solemn
tone
like
what
is
felt
in
passing
down
the
while
some
old
cathedral
venerable
aisle
a
feeling
all
its
own
but
now
at
close
of
day
when
the
damp
vapoury
veil
of
eve
is
gone
of
gathering
winds
the
mournful
moan
sounds
wildly
far
away
for
winter
casts
its
shade
before
it
and
the
year
begins
to
feel
its
chilling
influences
on
it
steal
like
touches
of
the
dead
no
sunset
light
on
the
landscape
shines
awhile
ere
vanishing
as
loth
to
leave
upon
the
mead
the
wearied
ox
at
eve
familiarly
reclines
the
plough
is
left
and
the
rude
labourer
from
his
toil
set
free
leads
his
tired
steads
forth
the
upturned
lea
refreshing
drink
to
yield
the
hills
with
light
are
dyed
and
pointing
spires
peer
the
distant
trees
as
one
tall
vessels
in
the
horizon
sees
careering
in
their
pride
each
meek
flower
white
and
red
that
tufts
the
meadow
in
fresh
odour
sleeps
ere
the
departing
day
from
off
the
steeps
lifts
his
resplendent
head
the
clouds
amid
which
now
the
sun
sinks
retain
his
glory
still
upon
their
brinks
as
gloom
the
earth
enshrouds
slowly
the
darkness
creeps
up
the
lone
by
sighs
of
lullabyed
as
on
man
eyes
steals
slumber
ere
he
sleeps
thus
on
the
and
on
the
hoary
castle
ruined
walls
the
rotting
ivy
clinging
as
it
falls
seems
their
past
strength
to
mock
exalted
are
the
thoughts
that
rise
within
our
souls
at
such
a
time
the
vast
the
wild
the
awful
the
sublime
embodied
round
us
floats
and
the
hushed
spirit
seems
to
listen
to
the
tones
from
giants
flung
echoes
of
that
of
old
were
sung
now
rush
like
mountain
streams
and
what
come
on
the
sight
are
not
the
puny
visions
of
the
day
the
near
and
the
familiar
pass
away
with
the
departing
light
each
mountain
range
that
towers
in
desert
grandeur
the
darkening
scene
looks
like
a
spirit
standing
now
between
another
world
and
ours
oh
ye
hills
the
ancient
the
immortal
is
it
not
a
privilege
to
be
forgot
to
feel
none
of
earth
ills
sublime
ye
are
as
heaven
though
bleak
not
barren
silent
yet
not
dumb
from
out
your
shadows
health
and
music
come
and
thronging
thoughts
are
given
not
worthless
is
your
aim
to
stand
from
age
to
age
from
hour
to
hour
the
almighty
temple
token
of
his
power
and
record
of
his
name
no
twilight
now
enter
we
within
the
shadows
of
the
as
they
wind
around
the
mountains
summits
and
remind
our
startled
souls
of
sin
coiling
like
serpent
twist
round
every
thought
and
impulse
thus
the
night
brings
down
its
sable
curtain
the
sight
and
veils
the
world
in
mist
the
curlew
song
wanders
like
poesy
in
distant
glades
and
inexpressive
notes
that
to
eve
shades
are
fitted
pass
along
the
beetle
drone
is
heard
dull
sluggish
heavy
in
the
lane
and
hark
afar
the
melancholy
strain
of
echo
twilight
bard
at
this
lone
hour
we
seek
some
quiet
spot
to
meditation
free
when
the
material
we
do
not
see
then
fancy
may
bespeak
aught
that
she
will
the
dim
and
shadowy
her
peopled
world
she
finds
forms
in
the
darkness
in
the
troublous
winds
can
trace
a
conqueror
hymn
sleep
has
its
dreams
and
night
its
inspirations
bounding
changing
still
imagination
on
some
shrouded
hill
does
alight
ah
not
an
hour
ago
here
hamlets
stood
and
palaces
and
fields
what
man
has
furnished
what
creation
yields
and
what
the
earth
does
grow
and
now
where
are
they
all
gone
with
the
mighty
vanished
with
the
past
for
twilight
enviously
has
them
cast
her
black
unpiercing
pall
and
shut
all
out
to
oh
vision
oh
weak
mortal
eyes
are
there
no
mountains
left
no
shining
skies
no
rivers
clothed
in
light
are
there
no
happy
broods
of
little
flowers
in
rustic
ways
remote
no
pathways
to
the
woods
and
oh
fell
thought
no
woods
such
fancies
rise
to
sight
in
night
tranquillity
where
thought
is
born
but
back
the
laughing
world
will
come
with
morn
life
is
not
all
a
blight
should
clouded
be
bring
yesterday
and
all
its
joys
to
view
though
no
offers
to
renew
their
smile
is
not
away
dawn
in
on
the
charm
of
nature
looks
the
voice
of
birds
the
minstrelsy
of
brooks
live
ever
in
their
prime
no
moonlight
on
land
the
early
bridal
moon
comes
in
her
splendour
forth
and
walks
between
the
stars
of
heaven
like
an
anointed
queen
amid
her
maids
at
noon
now
from
the
sleeping
hills
the
spectral
quickly
pass
away
beneath
her
pale
but
earth
enamoured
ray
and
glory
all
things
fills
forth
let
us
wander
led
by
odours
sweet
leaving
th
accustomed
way
the
valley
seek
we
where
the
moonbeams
stray
like
newly
shed
the
distant
streamlets
sing
their
vesper
is
there
a
voice
below
can
give
such
music
mingled
with
such
woe
or
can
such
rapture
bring
in
the
far
wild
we
hear
that
soothing
tone
its
murmurings
repeat
and
the
more
sad
the
sweeter
as
is
meet
the
spirit
lone
to
cheer
fair
is
the
sky
and
fair
the
earth
and
yet
is
but
the
moon
this
night
that
lights
them
both
and
makes
them
look
so
bright
clothes
them
in
beauty
rare
and
who
are
they
that
come
into
the
moonlight
from
the
tranquil
shade
and
then
shrink
back
as
to
be
seen
afraid
with
feelings
that
are
dumb
two
lovers
fond
and
true
holding
communion
with
each
other
hearts
the
first
pure
glow
of
love
that
departs
which
moonlight
scenes
renew
who
has
not
on
the
moon
looked
long
and
musingly
and
looking
dreamed
of
love
and
loveliness
who
has
not
deemed
its
ray
a
granted
boon
the
unveiled
orb
of
night
to
which
the
sighs
and
orisons
of
lovers
in
all
ages
have
been
breathed
bathes
all
she
sees
in
light
her
tracery
is
rich
with
images
mosaic
soft
inlaid
forms
slumber
the
light
and
shade
in
every
quiet
niche
moonlight
is
not
like
eld
for
it
is
young
and
bright
and
fresh
and
clear
but
age
the
features
sharpens
and
brings
near
resemblances
withheld
so
moonlight
in
its
pride
outlines
the
landscape
and
brings
out
to
view
scenes
of
bright
promise
and
of
fairy
hue
by
glen
and
mountain
side
in
moonlit
mead
or
dell
my
soul
endenizened
imbibes
a
tone
of
truth
which
still
is
prone
a
plaintive
tale
to
tell
no
moonlight
at
sea
how
beautiful
the
chaste
and
glorious
moonlight
glitters
on
the
wave
like
diamond
glancing
upward
from
its
cave
by
rushing
waters
paced
the
seaman
hails
its
ray
auspicious
as
it
gayly
flits
before
him
on
his
or
sits
like
silver
on
the
sails
profusely
thrown
in
showers
the
dancing
beam
with
every
wave
curl
dips
like
sunlight
sprinkled
on
the
bearded
lips
of
humble
on
the
lone
beetling
cliff
where
moonlight
streams
in
all
its
glory
bright
i
see
below
the
fishers
by
its
light
haul
beechward
their
rude
skiff
and
high
above
the
cot
which
they
call
home
stands
in
the
glad
moonlight
dear
to
their
hearts
and
welcome
to
their
sight
when
they
are
far
afloat
here
as
i
linger
rapt
in
the
lone
presence
of
the
ocean
free
suspended
like
a
bird
above
the
sea
my
bounding
soul
is
apt
to
mingle
as
its
own
among
the
waters
like
a
privileged
thing
or
as
a
seamew
spreads
its
radiant
wing
on
the
wild
breezes
thrown
to
wander
far
away
above
the
breakers
and
then
strength
inhale
or
float
like
one
inspired
upon
the
gale
and
all
its
might
survey
the
grey
sea
like
grey
time
rolls
onward
till
it
traces
its
fixed
bound
and
then
resumes
its
slow
accustomed
round
fettered
like
measured
rhyme
the
hollow
of
god
hand
might
hold
it
and
though
restless
in
its
pride
it
can
not
outflow
its
appointed
tide
or
overrun
the
land
when
the
rude
tempest
sings
and
waves
run
high
and
harsh
the
thunder
threats
assail
the
ear
the
seaman
forgets
the
promise
moonlight
brings
amid
the
lashing
foam
when
its
soft
smile
anoints
the
boiling
wave
it
tracks
his
pathway
prompts
his
soul
to
brave
whatever
perils
come
homeward
his
vessel
drifts
with
beauty
fair
behind
it
and
before
hope
leads
it
onward
to
the
shore
and
all
the
heart
uplifts
like
mellow
light
of
years
long
since
evanished
on
the
memory
the
moonlight
falls
upon
the
bounding
sea
and
the
whole
present
cheers
no
home
scenes
as
young
bird
from
its
nest
at
morn
floats
upward
onward
and
away
and
when
the
night
brings
down
its
shadows
grey
returns
unto
its
rest
thus
the
youthful
mind
goes
forward
to
the
world
partakes
its
cares
and
fleeting
joys
is
tempted
by
its
snares
but
can
no
refuge
find
the
freshness
of
his
home
goes
with
him
guidingly
he
wends
a
light
upon
his
steps
attends
a
ray
from
heaven
bright
dome
in
all
his
toil
and
fret
the
quiet
fields
and
gentle
streams
he
knew
when
youth
clothed
all
around
in
fairest
hue
his
soul
can
forget
for
still
their
memories
come
like
poetry
to
his
spirit
as
a
tone
of
music
echo
on
the
waters
thrown
and
heard
evening
gloom
in
brumal
age
the
dreams
of
home
refresh
the
soul
as
purples
pied
peep
up
from
out
the
snows
and
smile
beside
winter
deserted
streams
as
violets
on
a
rock
they
cheer
the
solitude
their
promise
dawns
upon
the
mind
like
moonlight
the
lawns
or
joy
to
one
home
of
our
youth
what
spot
on
earth
is
like
thee
scenes
of
early
days
oh
where
upon
your
equals
can
we
gaze
what
palace
like
the
cot
where
childhood
first
its
eyes
oped
to
the
day
and
marvelled
what
could
be
the
world
around
it
is
there
aught
we
see
can
be
compared
to
skies
like
those
which
earliest
shone
upon
our
path
and
like
a
sunray
bright
brought
with
it
freshly
dawnings
of
the
light
that
can
be
forgone
landscapes
of
other
climes
though
bountiful
in
beauty
what
are
ye
to
the
fair
scenes
of
home
it
be
sacred
as
churchward
chimes
high
may
the
mountains
tower
into
the
heavens
and
grandeur
fill
the
scene
the
valleys
and
the
pastures
may
be
green
the
still
in
flower
of
other
lands
where
stray
the
exile
feet
but
none
are
so
fair
unto
his
soul
as
the
blest
landscapes
where
his
visions
fly
away
those
sordid
cares
beside
that
cloud
the
mind
woes
and
ills
come
soothing
thoughts
of
home
as
far
hills
the
gentle
streamlets
glide
poetical
aspirations
a
small
volume
of
poems
entitled
poetical
aspirations
was
published
by
me
my
first
adventure
in
and
was
favourably
received
that
volume
was
dedicated
to
mrs
robertson
of
ednam
house
kelso
a
lady
whose
many
virtues
are
universally
acknowledged
wherever
she
is
known
and
whose
kindness
to
me
it
will
always
be
my
pride
to
remember
a
second
edition
with
additional
poems
appeared
in
from
the
latter
volume
i
have
selected
the
following
pieces
the
remainder
bearing
evident
marks
of
inexperience
and
juvenility
of
taste
not
being
deemed
worthy

reprint
poetical
aspirations
the
alpine
horn
sunset
is
streaming
the
crown
of
the
high
alps
while
darkness
settles
down
through
all
their
countless
valleys
and
defiles
mixing
with
shade
where
sunlight
never
smiles
ere
from
the
topmost
peak
its
latest
ray
has
with
its
wing
of
glory
sped
away
the
mountain
shepherd
horn
has
sounded
there
like
the
muezzin
evening
call
to
prayer
praise
god
the
lord
and
hark
from
all
around
a
thousand
voices
answer
to
the
sound
from
every
clift
and
crag
and
ledge
and
linn
the
notes
of
worship
and
of
praise
begin
praise
god
the
lord
the
echoes
catch
the
strain
and
far
and
near
repeat
the
sound
again
they
wake
it
in
the
wild
and
in
the
wood
through
all
the
shades
of
that
far
solitude
bearing
it
on
valley
and
ravine
where
till
this
hour
such
sound
has
never
been
then
in
the
distance
fainter
grown
the
lay
the
lingering
notes
at
length
dissolve
away
when
all
is
silent
on
the
mountain
sod
the
humble
shepherds
bend
the
knee
to
god
they
kneel
in
darkness
and
in
peace
to
share
the
sweet
and
social
intercourse
of
prayer
with
gleams
of
manly
thought
their
prayers
arise
like
incense
from
the
altar
to
the
skies
their
temple
is
the
mountain
and
the
mist
and
theirs
the
shrine
where
minister
the
blest
they
kneel
before
the
spirit
of
the
world
he
who
this
universe
of
mountains
hurled
together
with
a
word
and
chaos
spread
mid
majesty
and
grandeur
dark
and
dread
prostrate
in
presence
of
the
great
first
cause
they
own
his
power
while
they
obey
his
laws
their
thoughts
are
deeper
than
th
abyss
beneath
yet
while
their
humble
orisons
they
breathe
their
souls
are
soaring
far
beyond
each
height
on
which
the
stars
are
clustering
with
the
night
and
while
they
view
with
glance
the
world
of
fancy
nature
and
romance
that
circles
round
their
native
rocks
they
deem
the
glories
of
the
earth
an
empty
dream
but
hark
that
horn
again
resounds
aloud
like
sudden
music
bursting
from
a
cloud
good
night
good
night
along
the
mountain
breaks
good
night
good
night
again
each
echo
wakes
and
all
the
scene
below
around
above
teems
with
good
night
the
evening
pledge
of
love
the
eagle
soaring
waits
upon
the
wing
charmed
with
the
notes
the
syren
echoes
sing
the
startled
chamois
bounds
along
the
hill
yet
turns
to
listen
still
from
mount
to
valley
and
from
wold
to
wild
the
sounds
are
borne
along
till
faint
and
mild
good
night
shall
linger
in
the
echoes
song
when
all
to
silence
and
to
sleep
belong
reflections
on
death
one
day
the
sunbeams
danced
along
the
glade
as
lovers
dance
upon
their
bridal
eve
i
wandered
to
the
wood
where
all
was
bloom
the
earth
breathed
fresh
with
fragrance
and
the
trees
dropped
as
it
were
the
dew
of
silent
joy
i
loved
to
listen
to
the
song
of
birds
whose
music
wild
yet
sweet
came
the
ear
telling
of
ecstasy
and
more
than
all
i
loved
to
view
the
flowers
those
stars
of
earth
as
stars
are
flowers
of
heaven
those
glimpses
bright
of
a
far
higher
purer
lovelier
world
those
day
dreams
of
creation
blooming
wild
scattered
on
earth
like
in
heaven
oh
i
was
happy
then
for
all
above
and
all
below
was
fair
and
pure
and
bright
and
then
i
thought
that
happier
still
i
be
if
my
freed
soul
could
fleet
as
dew
from
grass
when
the
glad
morning
sun
is
shining
forth
passing
so
silently
away
from
earth
if
that
were
all
if
death
itself
were
but
after
death
comes
life
more
true
than
this
i
lay
and
listened
to
a
wild
bird
song
a
little
shining
singing
thing
its
song
was
full
of
sweetness
and
of
love
when
lo
it
fell
before
me
on
the
ground
and
found
its
grave
among
a
bank
of
flowers
who
would
not
die
to
find
a
grave
so
sweet
i
ran
and
lifted
it
was
cold
and
stiff
and
in
its
little
heart
an
arrow
sought
unsanctified
admittance
quivering
there
like
an
unwelcome
messenger
of
fate
the
spoiler
came
i
drew
his
arrow
out
and
threw
it
on
the
earth
he
trod
it
down
as
he
passed
onward
in
his
careless
path
and
this
is
death
how
sudden
and
how
strong
his
harvest
begins
nor
ends
for
still
his
scythe
is
ready
ere
the
corn
is
ripe
we
can
not
shun
the
stroke
but
if
prepared
to
meet
it
when
it
falls
its
sting
is
gone
yet
death
itself
is
never
terrible
but
is
the
thought
of
what
comes
after
death
that
wakes
the
coward
in
the
soul
of
man
of
man
carnal
and
unregenerate
in
the
lone
grave
the
body
soon
is
clothed
in
vileness
and
this
most
delicate
frame
becomes
the
food
of
worms
the
gorging
feast
of
those
vile
particles
of
putresence
we
loathe
in
life
to
look
at
which
we
spurn
and
trample
on
with
horror
bend
low
and
meditate
on
this
that
slimy
worms
and
insatiate
epicures
must
feed
on
us
to
fulness
as
on
dainties
when
we
like
they
themselves
become
corruption
this
is
the
pang
the
poison
that
makes
dark
the
brightest
joys
and
chills
the
warmest
hopes
of
all
who
look
no
farther
than
the
grave
that
calms
the
laughing
thought
within
the
heart
this
is
the
weapon
that
affrights
the
bold
makes
foolishness
of
wisdom
and
creates
the
fear
of
death
because
it
terminates
but
in
corruption
and
the
feast
of
worms
to
go
into
the
grave
if
that
were
all
no
one
would
shrink
from
it
but
that
the
thought
that
this
fair
form
should
formless
be
the
shape
be
shapeless
decomposed
and
fall
to
nought
preys
on
the
mind
and
hinders
it
from
rest
and
few
there
are
who
seek
the
saving
peace
that
here
can
reconcile
us
to
our
doom
the
soul
remains
entire
though
in
the
grave
the
body
lies
and
slowly
wastes
away
then
let
us
strive
to
find
through
god
good
grace
that
faith
by
which
alone
the
soul
becomes
one
perfect
chrysolite
and
in
christ
blood
relieved
from
stain
of
guilt
is
rendered
fit
to
stand
approved
before
a
holy
god
through
the
wood
modern
ballad
through
the
wood
through
the
wood
warbles
the
merle
through
the
wood
through
the
wood
gallops
the
earl
yet
he
heeds
not
its
song
as
it
sinks
on
his
ear
for
he
lists
to
a
voice
than
its
music
more
dear
through
the
wood
through
the
wood
once
and
away
the
castle
is
gained
and
the
lady
is
gay
when
her
smile
waxes
sad
and
her
eyes
become
dim
her
bosom
is
glad
if
she
gazes
on
him
through
the
wood
through
the
wood
over
the
wold
rides
onward
a
band
of
true
warriors
bold
they
stop
not
for
forest
they
halt
not
for
water
their
chieftain
in
sorrow
is
seeking
his
daughter
through
the
wood
through
the
wood
warbles
the
merle
through
the
wood
through
the
wood
prances
the
earl
and
on
a
gay
palfrey
comes
pacing
his
bride
while
an
old
man
sits
smiling
in
joy
by
her
side
song
of
the
exile
banished
for
ever
from
the
scene
of
my
birth
for
ever
for
ever
from
all
i
loved
dearest
and
cherished
on
earth
from
the
smile
of
my
friends
and
the
home
of
their
hearth
to
come
again
never
banished
for
ever
from
hope
and
from
home
for
ever
for
ever
away
in
the
desert
of
distance
to
roam
like
a
ship
on
the
wild
foam
to
land
again
never
banished
for
ever
when
all
have
gone
by
for
ever
for
ever
the
gladness
of
earth
and
the
brightness
of
sky
there
no
fear
but
to
live
and
no
hope
but
to
die
to
again
never
banished
for
ever
is
madness
to
me
for
ever
for
ever
to
think
of
the
land
i
shall
again
see
of
the
days
that
have
been
and
the
days
that
shall
be
that
thought
leaves
me
never
banished
for
ever
be
this
my
adieu
for
ever
for
ever
let
me
roam
where
i
will
again
shall
i
view
scenes
so
cherished
and
fair
friends
so
kind
and
so
true
oh
never
oh
never
banished
for
ever
dear
land
of
my
birth
we
sever
we
sever
an
exile
from
all
i
love
dearest
on
earth
from
the
smile
of
my
friends
from
the
home
of
their
hearth
for
ever
for
ever
to
fame
in
the
seclusion
of
my
solitude
thy
echo
reached
me
and
awoke
a
brood
of
slumbering
fancies
into
life
and
light
a
spell
seemed
thrown
around
me
and
my
mind
was
full
of
unfixed
images
the
bright
and
ready
impulses
of
thought
confined
and
struggling
to
be
free
a
light
had
dawned
across
my
path
as
if
by
heaven
command
a
lofty
and
immeasurable
longing
sprung
up
within
my
breast
beyond
control
a
throbbing
multitude
of
fancies
thronging
strove
to
and
the
whole
creation
rose
from
chaos
as
at
first
a
water
in
the
wilderness
to
quench
my
thirst
the
complicated
elements
of
mind
no
longer
dim
confused
and
undefined
rolled
into
order
and
the
springs
of
thought
became
then
less
obscure
and
less
remote
my
mind
not
yet
in
union
with
its
thoughts
seemed
sad
and
solitary
it
swept
a
calmness
like
the
soft
that
floats
above
the
wave
that
light
and
languid
leapt
then
high
imaginations
restless
past
into
being
various
vivid
vast
and
thought
admixing
with
the
mind
emotion
assumed
a
depth
and
fervour
of
devotion
the
semblance
and
the
hope
if
not
the
true
sole
inspiration
of
poetic
lore
then
truth
at
times
like
light
came
struggling
through
and
i
was
sad
and
no
more
for
thou
became
my
mistress
i
have
thrown
my
heart
and
hope
on
thee
i
can
not
bear
that
with
my
life
my
name
should
pass
away
and
be
forgot
when
i
am
dead
and
gone
and
in
the
grave
when
mouldering
in
decay
that
my
remembrance
should
be
buried
there
i
care
not
for
the
world
or
the
world
ways
i
scorn
alike
its
censure
and
its
praise
but
from
the
mental
few
by
heaven
designed
to
rate
and
recognise
a
kindred
mind
a
sure
approval
i
will
strive
to
gain
for
this
is
fame
indeed
all
other
is
but
vain
to
a
bee
ha
pretty
little
bee
so
artless
blithe
and
free
whither
are
you
wandering
thus
so
gaily
on
the
wing
to
every
flower
with
dew
whose
leaves
are
blossoming
for
you
to
the
wild
flowers
far
away
bright
and
beautiful
as
they
from
each
blooming
one
to
sip
sweets
like
those
of
woman
lip
oh
happy
happy
happy
bee
would
it
were
as
free
to
me
away
away
for
ever
thus
your
airy
flight
has
past
from
us
and
you
are
gone
where
flowers
invite
a
pilgrimage
of
rich
delight
but
come
not
near
the
hollyhock
let
not
its
blooms
your
fancy
mock
shun
its
nectaries
so
fair
death
is
ever
lurking
there
on
its
petals
if
you
light
you
be
seized
with
instant
blight
shun
it
as
you
onward
fly
sip
its
poison
and
you
die
but
hie
thee
to
the
lavender
pretty
little
pilferer
or
the
limetree
in
whose
breast
you
oft
have
sipped
yourself
to
rest
go
wanderer
to
the
healthful
wild
by
the
bloom
beguiled
where
sunshine
like
a
robe
of
gold
flings
its
fond
light
wood
and
wold
there
in
the
calyx
of
the
flower
you
love
the
best
at
noontide
hour
prepare
the
mead
whose
luscious
draught
the
best
of
former
nations
quaff
little
rambler
do
you
know
why
it
is
we
love
you
so
it
is
for
the
ceaseless
hymn
that
you
warble
as
you
swim
through
the
odoriferous
air
light
as
fairy
gossamer
is
for
you
are
always
gay
making
life
a
holiday
flying
leisurely
earth
a
wingëd
messenger
of
mirth
when
you
meet
the
butterfly
the
lovely
summer
sky
do
you
show
to
her
the
bower
that
contains
the
sweetest
flower
or
do
you
take
herself
to
be
while
thus
wandering
so
free
a
floweret
floating
on
the
air
making
all
delightful
there
when
the
moon
bursts
forth
above
tinging
all
with
light
and
love
when
with
soft
and
silky
trace
slumber
finds
a
resting
place
on
the
eyes
of
bees
and
men
snug
within
some
floweret
then
you
have
made
your
bed
till
day
shows
the
sweets
your
dreams
pourtray
the
storm
the
waves
rise
in
rebellion
far
away
the
ship

borne
resistless
on
and
hark
the
screaming
trill
their
lay
of
terrible
delight
its
echo
moan
dies
wildly
on
the
tempest
and
the
spray
dashes
around
us
chilling
hope
to
stone
and
vast
and
fathomless
the
mountain
waves
yawning
around
us
marshall
forth
our
graves
the
clouds
move
like
the
billows
the
ocean
clashing
in
fury
as
they
hurry
by
they
mingle
fiercely
and
in
rude
commotion
as
if
a
hurricane
swept
the
sky
now
let
the
soul
rely
on
her
devotion
now
let
the
prayer
to
him
be
lifted
high
who
stills
the
storm
and
calms
the
mighty
wave
and
strong
to
smite
is
also
strong
to
save
see
yon
poor
wretch
dashed
from
the
vessel
prow
he
catches
at
the
spar
that
hurries
past
is
vain
the
waves
are
mightier
still
and
now
beneath
their
force
his
strength
gives
way
at
last
onward
we
drift
but
lo
heaven
brow
the
moon
her
welcome
light
at
length
has
cast
like
hope
madness
but
it
tends
to
show
the

smiles
above
the
death

yawns

the

his

obeyed

the

thus
when

sin

depart
from

he
cleans
it

comes
thy

may
a

thy

thoughts
in

when
the

sun
ascends
the

and
on
the
mountain
zephyr
health
is
borne
while
we
inhale
it
as
it
murmurs
by
on
some
lone
hill
in
musing
mood
to
lie
then
as
we
watch
the
day
advancing
light
we
learn
from
it
that
we
but
live
to
die
the
sun
will
set
though
shining
so
bright
a
few
short
fleeting
hours
and
all
again
is
night
yet
sunshine
seldom
cheers
the
lot
of
life
is
all
a
scene
of
pain
and
woe
a
pilgrimage
of
fruitless
care
and
strife
a
tide
of
sorrow
that
doth
ceaseless
flow
yet
some
have
thought
they
felt
a
joy
below
which
to
their
darker
hours
did
solace
prove
making
their
hearts
with
blissful
feelings
glow
and
not
of
earth
it
seems
but
from
above
it
comes
to
cheer
mankind
and
mortals
call
it
love
that
thought
is
vain
as
love
own
happiness
for
soon
love
sweet
illusion
is
no
more
then
fly
those
hopes
that
promised
lasting
bliss
and
when
the
dream
of
ecstasy
is
we
wake
to
life
far
sadder
than
before
it
shoots
athwart
our
visions
like
the
gleam
of
flitting
sunshine
a
desert
shore
making
the
wilderness
more
dreary
seem
oh
love
is
all
too
like
the
visions
of
a
dream
it
boots
not
now
to
ponder
the
past
joy
blasted
oft
will
mar
life
fairest

the

where

late
hath
been
and
thorns
appear
where
once

were

beams
on
my
soul
her
soothing
light
like
the
first
dawning

the
morn
serene
tinging
my
darkened
soul
with
hues
more
bright
love
ever
sorrow
brings
as
twilight
brings
the
night
is
piety
alone
that
can
impart
a
peace

that
will
fade
away
a
bliss
that
calms
the

soothes

that
gives
a

to

relentless
seizes
on

thee

removed

thou

in

while

are
growing
in

and
ancient

our

we
turn
and
like

melody
thy
echoes
glide
within
the

while
grey
and

stands
like
a
spirit
of
the

lone

changeless

it

roaming

ferocious
for

soon
as

its

takes

his

forsakes
and
like

rushing
to

scatters

and
the
swain
one
summer
eve
a
monster
of
the
kind
hungry
for
prey
had
left
his
troop
behind
ranging
alone
he
spread

his

was
heard
as
if
a
host
were
there
beneath
his
tusk
of
steel
his
breath
of
flame
italia
bowers
a
wilderness
became
grain
for
a
while
and
sheep
he
stole
away
but
quitting
these
he
sought
a
nobler
prey
the
tender
babe
even
in
its
mother
view
he
bore
to
crags
where
no
one
dared
pursue
until
the
province
late
the
happiest
one
that
brightens
italia
gorgeous
sun
became
throughout
all
desolate
and
lone
for
there
the
fell
destroyer
forth
had
gone
lo
like
a
pageant
slowly
up
the
vale
a
band
advances
clad
in
glittering
mail
while
in
the
front
a
knight
of
noble
mien
and
lofty
plume
above
the
rest
is
seen
the
peasants
from
their
huts
look
forth
with
fear
but
dare
not
quit
them
lest
the
wolf
be
near
and
then
the
chief
advancing
from
the
rest
at
sound
of
trump
the
peasants
thus
addressed
a
purse
of
gold
and
his
own
diamond
ring
as
a
reward
are
offered
by
the
king
to
him
who
slays
the
wolf
the
trumpet
blast
loud
as
that
gay
pageant
passed
meanwhile
each
swain
in
hope
to
gain
the
prize
shouldering
his
gun
to
kill
the
monster
tries
but
home
returning
oft
without
his
prey
all
left
the
task
to
giulio
to
essay
for
giulio
was
the
best
the
bravest
youth
within
the
province
or
the
realm
in
sooth
kind
to
his
mates
and
to
his
mistress
true
foremost
in
pastime
and
in
peril
too
the
river
overflowed
its
bounds
and
the
wild
flood
the
pleasant
grounds
bearing
away
in
its
retiring
course
the
helpless
flocks
too
feeble
for
its
force
giulio
was
first
among
the
village
brave
to
stretch
the
hand
to
succour
and
to
save
he
was
a
marksman
too
and
well
could
hit
the
target
eye
when
all
fell
wide
of
it
him
therefore
did
they
fix
upon
to
be
their
champion
their
meadows
rich
to
free
from
the
destroyer
each
resigned
his
claim
to
the
reward
let
giulio
win
the
same
and
giulio
ranged
afar
from
morn
till
eve
but
still
no
wolf
could
giulio
perceive
he
searched
each
wood
explored
each
copse
and
cave
as
a
fierce
gnome
invades
the
quiet
grave
still
did
he
hear
his
roar
his
ravage
see
but
still
unseen
himself
the
wolf
continued
free
three
days
had
sped
and
giulio
had
not
traced
the
monster
out
although
he
tracked
his
waste
and
standing
on
a
mountain
rugged
brow
giulio
despairing
breathed
to
heaven
a
vow
that
he
would
bring
the
wolf
in
triumph
slain
or
never
see
his
native
home
again
and
giulio
vow
was
kept
the
monster
fell
but
not
by
him
a
sadder
tale
i
tell
one
eve
it
was
the
fourth
he
threw
him
down
fatigued
and
on
the
mountain
brown
no
wolf
as
yet
had
crossed
his
anxious
way
although
he
roamed
he
heard
his
bay
loth
to
return
until
the
wolf
he
slew
yet
ah
his
heart
to
love
to
feeling
true
led
him
to
where
his
lover
hut
arose
as
if
her
vicinage
could
soothe
his
woes
there
for
awhile
he
lingered
and
he
wept
the
tear
of
fond
remembrance
slumber
crept
upon
his
eyes
for
he
was
overspent
wasted
for
want
of
needful
nourishment
before
him
in
the
moonlight
rolled
a
stream
whose
murmur
lulled
him
to
a
blissful
dream
a
dream
of
love
of
happiness
and
pride
he
thought
he
slew
the
wolf
and
won
his
blushing
bride
beyond
the
river
to
its
very
edge
along
the
bank
there
grew
a
bushy
hedge
where
oft
alone
beneath
the
twilight
dim
the
lovely
maid
would
steal
to
think
of
him
a
stir
a
motion
it
was
not
the
breeze
that
shook
the
hedge
for
why
waved
not
the
trees
he
started
and
awoke
again
it
shook
his
gun
was
in
his
hand
one
hurried
look
one
rapid
touch
the
fatal
ball
was
sped
a
long
wild
shriek
was
heard
and
giulio
dream
was
read
in
triumph
now
he
thought
of
home
again
the
prize
was
his
the
wolf
at
length
was
slain
swift
as
the
ball
that
from
his
rifle
flew
he
reached
the
river
and
swam
gaily
through
the
corpse
lay
there
before
him
in
the
light
why
breaks
that
mournful
shriek
upon
the
night
why
motionless
stands
giulio
gazing
there
a
form
of
stone
a
statue
of
despair
at
length
he
spoke
is
the
wolf
i
sought
in
glen
and
mount
and
precipice
remote
its
skin
is
soft
its
eyes
are
bright
and
fair
and
still
they
smile
on
me
the
wolf
should
glare
but
sweet
though
sad
still
do
they
charm
my
view
like
my
fair
bride
the
beautiful
the
blue
the
wolf
ah
horror
is
herself
i
slain
i
feel
it
like
a
fire
within
my
brain
and
on
my
heart
no
tear
is
in
mine
eye
for
her
alone
i
lived
with
her
i
die
the
stream
is
near
he
lifts
her
as
a
child
while
from
his
heart
there
bursts
a
wild
and
fiendish
laugh
the
peasants
wondering
hear
and
in
a
crowd
assemble
half
in
fear
in
the
broad
moonlight
then
as
in
a
dream
a
figure
rushed
before
them
to
the
stream
that
form
did
bear
another
on
the
brink
he
pauses
not
one
plunge
they
sink
they
sink
was
giulio
and
his
bride
they
rise
no
more
and
onward
rolls
the
stream
as
smoothly
as
before
the
april
cloud
fair
as
the
feather
of
a
dove
that
has
in
gloom
been
dipt
like
to
a
smile
that
flung
from
love
its
banishment
hath
wept
see
yonder
little
cloud
swims
by
as
if
it
sprung
to
birth
mid
summer
sunshine
of
the
sky
and
winter
storms
of
earth
alas
there
was
angel
yet
who
from
her
heaven
took
wing
but
when
the
air
of
earth
she
met
became
a
fallen
thing
and
thus
yon
cloud
that
seems
so
dim
when
near
our
earth
is
driven
would
look
all
light
if
it
would
skim
far
upward
nearer
heaven
spring
can
aught
be
more
magnificent
than
spring
mountain
and
mead
and
foliage
and
flower
assume
a
bridal
look
as
if
the
sun
had
solemnized
his
nuptials
with
the
earth
a
green
and
growing
grandeur
consecrates
the
general
land
like
an
anointed
queen
the
soil
begins
to
quicken
with
the
birth
and
bounteously
proseminates
its
gifts
a
glory
reigns
supreme
all
a
balm
that
moves
like
inspiration
in
the
soul
and
gives
a
motive
to
each
quiet
thought
stirring
in
transport
like
a
little
bird
creation
seems
a
path
to
brighter
worlds
a
track
to
better
homes
a
permeant
good
pervades
the
universe
and
all
is
joy
the
river
runs
like
one
of
nimble
foot
and
smiling
aspect
to
embrace
the
sea
henceforth
incorporate
even
as
the
youth
of
fervent
spirit
and
of
sanguine
hope
comes
from
his
home
obscure
and
wanders
forth
to
mingle
with
the
world
and
there
is
lost
the
ruminating
ocean
is
at
peace
and
its
faint
murmur
for
its
voice
is
all
silent
like
a
half
forgotten
tone
seems
but
the
echo
of
a
broken
chime
as
if
a
part
of
memory
had
gone
in
quest
of
all
and
died
away
amid
the
distant
traces
of
the
past
the
gentle
breeze
comes
from
its
groves
of
spice
and
fragrance
bears
throughout
the
virgin
air
and
hark
the
woodland
music
warblings
soft
steal
on
the
gladdened
ear
from
every
hedge
from
every
forest
dim
a
voice
proceeds
of
rapture
praise
and
gratitude
the
swan
disports
upon
the
quiet
lake
and
shares
the
cheerfulness
that
all
enjoy
while
thoughts
without
a
voice
of
heaven
remote
in
the
still
waters
mirrored
stir
its
all
circumstance
of
language
is
too
faint
the
beautiful
of
nature
to
pourtray
the
eloquent
sense
the
feeling
sensitive
alone
holds
free
communion
with
her
charms
while
thought
awakes
like
and
goes
forth
to
gather
stores
of
knowledge
like
a
draught
of
the
pure
fountain
to
the
unrefreshed
the
bloom
of
spring
exhilarates
the
mind
and
gives
a
tone
to
virtue
its
approach
is
as
the
coming
of
sweet
health
to
one
long
time
afflicted
for
its
bloom
is
blest
poesy
its
sweetest
song
the
cygnet
sings
as
a
soft
prelude
to
its
death
and
in
that
song
expends
its
breath
what
boots
it
that
the
poet
flings
his
wildest
notes
on
high
or
strikes
with
truest
hand
the
strings
if
all
his
strains
must
die
and
why
should
he
his
notes
prolong
if
no
one
listens
to
his
song
yet
can
the
poet
resign
the
lyre
he
loves
for
it
alone
consoles
him
when
all
else
is
gone
its
spirit
like
the
breath
divine
that
stirred
the
water
face
pervades
to
the
farthest
line
of
universal
space
and
music
through
the
whole
is
flung
as
when
the
morning
angels
sung
an
echo
lingers
on
each
peak
in
every
vale
on
every
hill
should
men
not
listen
angels
will
for
poesy
shall
never
speak
shall
never
sing
in
vain
in
solitude
the
breeze
shall
seek
and
still
repeat
her
strain
like
an
aërial
tone
her
spirit
and
her
voice
have
gone
she
moves
flowers
her
handmaid
fair
bright
summer
in
a
joyous
dance
doth
still
before
her
path
advance
sweet
blossoms
strewing
every
where
which
falling
grow
divine
fresh
incense
crowds
upon
the
air
and
floats
above
her
shrine
like
beauty
when
her
welcome
voice
makes
the
whole
universe
rejoice
why
then
should
her
adorer
fear
or
why
her
votary
despond
partaker
of
a
bliss
beyond
all
feelings
all
enjoyments
here
his
impulses
sublime
soar
in
this
contracted
sphere
nature
and
time
and
her
undying
triumphs
spread
a
glow
like
glory
round
his
head
sonnet
to
a
friend
of
the
author
is
evening
and
the
summer
has
put
on
her
richest
dress
her
way
with
flowers
is
strewed
beauty
and
music
dwell
in
every
wood
and
bower
and
meadow
hill
and
valley
lone
a
gentle
shower
is
the
earth
has
wept
its
fragrance
into
freshness
in
this
hour
when
in
a
flood
of
glory
all
is
dipped
by
the
soft
influence
of
a
higher
power
my
spirit
leaves
its
and
flies
towards
the
sweet
haunts
of
thy
pleasant
home
where
thy
river
loves
to
roam
is
there
i
see
thee
with
my
mental
eyes
and
hold
communion
with
thee
day
by

though
now
we
never
meet
and
haply
never
may
the
tweed
near
kelso
the
gipsy
lullaby
sleep
baby
sleep
though
thy
fond
mother
breast
where
thy
young
head
reclines
is
a
stranger
to
rest
and
oh
may
soft
slumber
descend
on
thine
that
the
sorrow
she
feels
may
be
shared
not
by
thee
sleep
baby
sleep
thy
father
has
gone
on
his
perilous
track
and
thy
mother
will
weep
till
he
safely
comes
back
but
rest
thee
in
peace
with
soft
sleep
in
thine
though
the
tear
is
in
that
is

woodland
song
will
you
go
to
the
woodlands
with
me
with
me
will
you
go
to
the
woodlands
with
me
when
the
sun
on
the
hill
and
all
nature
is
still
save
the
sound
of
the
sea
for
i
love
to
lie
lone
on
the
hill
the
hill
i
love
to
lie
lone
on
the
hill
when
earth
sea
and
sky
in
loveliness
vie
and
all
nature
around
me
is
still
then
my
fancy
is
ever
awake
awake
my
fancy
is
never
asleep
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
like
a
swan
on
the
lake
like
a
ship
far
away
on
the
deep
and
i
love
the
green
boughs
to
lie
to
lie
i
love
the
green
boughs
to
lie
and
see
far
above
like
the
smiling
of
love
a
glimpse
now
and
then
of
the
sky
when
the
hum
of
the
forest
i
hear
i
hear
when
the
hum
of
the
forest
i
hear
is
solitude
prayer
pure
devotion
is
there
and
its
breathings
i
ever
i
kneel
myself
down
on
the
sod
the
sod
i
kneel
myself
down
on
the
sod
the
flowers
and
wild
heath
and
an
orison
breathe
in
lowliness
up
to
my
god
then
peace
doth
descend
on
my
mind
my
mind
then
peace
doth
descend
on
my
mind
and
i
gain
greater
scope
to
my
spirit
and
hope
for
both
then
become
more
refined
oh
whatever
my
fate
chance
to
be
to
be
my
spirit
shall
never
repine
if
a
stroll
on
the
hill
if
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
if
the
hum
of
the
forest
be
mine
sonnet
the
ocean
oh
that
the
ocean
were
my
element
and
i
could
dwell
among
its
deepest
waves
like
one
whose
home
is
in
its
gushing
caves
beneath
the
waters
whether
tame
or
rent
would
i
could
roam
down
where
the
mermaid
laves
her
limbs
for
envy
comes
not
there
nor
pride
nor
hatred
nor
is
malice
sent
nor
the
deep
sullenness
of
dark
despair
would
i
were
not
of
earth
but
of
the
sea
and
held
communion
with
its
creatures
fair
gentle
in
its
gentleness
but
a
tempest
shook
it
and
the
winds
were
free
my
bounding
spirit
would
delight
to
soar
float
in
its
foam
and
revel
in
its
roar
mount
horeb
oh
holy
mount
on
every
side
deserts
are
stretching
far
and
wide
where
thou
uptowering
to
the
sky
dost
shoot
thy
double
head
on
high
mount
horeb
and
mount
sinai
and
when
the
weary
traveller
stands
alone
amid
the
sterile
sands
seeking
for
water
vain
pursuit
to
quench
his
thirst
grown
absolute
groaning
as
fainter
grows
his
hope
for
water
water
but
a
drop
his
ever
burning
thirst
t
appease
he
through
the
sudden
moonlight
sees
thy
dark
and
shadowy
masses
rise
a
solace
to
his
weary
eyes
then
gladly
on
he
wends
for
he
becomes
refreshed
at
sight
of
thee
for
well
he
knows
that
springs
and
fruit
above
below
thy
sides
salute
for
the
wastes
of
rephidim
there
is
no
spot
of
peace
for
him
until
he
reach
the
rock
whence
burst
a
well
to
quench
the
raging
thirst
of
israel
when
they
murmured
there
for
water
in
their
deep
despair
thrice
sacred
mount
how
oft
hast
thou
though
none
but
pilgrims
tread
thee
now
been
hallowed
as
the
blest
abode
of
the
most
high
jehovah
god
in
furthering
his
plan
of
mercy
and
of
love
to
man
he
deigned
to
touch
our
earth
to
hold
communion
with
his
seers
of
old
his
presence
consecrated
thee
his
temple
and
his
throne
to
be
was
on
thy
mount
that
god
concealed
within
the
burning
bush
revealed
to
moses
his
command
to
free
his
people
from
their
slavery
there
from
the
midst
of
fire
and
flame
he
did
his
perfect
law
proclaim
then
seemed
god
presence
in
their
sight
a
great
a
mighty
burst
of
light
upon
thy
topmost
mount
a
fire
devouring
brighter
deeper
higher
than
their
eyes
beheld
a
crown
of
glory
on
thy
head
that
down
through
all
the
desert
brightness
past
like
wild
flame
from
a
holocaust
and
gazing
on
thy
glorious
height
israel
was
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
that
intolerable
light
pursued
by
persecution
flame
elijah
to
the
desert
came
and
as
he
rested
in
thy
cave
which
shelter
and
concealment
gave
god
spoke
he
lay
entranced
in
fear
elijah
speak
what
dost
thou
here
he
answered
jezabel
abhorred
hath
put
the
prophets
to
the
sword
and
i
alone
escaped
to
be
a
prophet
and
a
priest
to
thee
then
the
almighty
gave
command
go
forth
and
on
the
mountain
stand
but
ere
elijah
could
reply
a
great
and
mighty
wind
passed
by
which
rent
the
mountains
and
the
rocks
in
pieces
by
resistless
shocks
the
desert
sands
uprose
afar
moving
like
giant
forms
in
war
but
when
the
tempest
ceased
to
rave
elijah
still
within
the
cave
remained
unhurt
unmoved
alone
a
mighty
earthquake
shock
anon
shook
to
its
base
the
sacred
mount
and
soon
a
fire
like
a
small
fount
came
bursting
from
the
highest
spot
increasing
but
consuming
not
the
earthquake
vanished
as
it
came
and
after
it
that
holy
flame
and
hark
a
still
small
voice
was
heard
like
sweetest
music
from
a
bird
a
still
small
voice
that
speaks
to
youth
of
wisdom
piety
and
truth
elijah
heard
with
solemn
pace
his
mantle
covering
his
face
he
rose
and
stood
without
the
cave
relying
on
god
power
to
save
the
hurricane
had
past
away
and
calm
and
bright
the
prospect
lay
far
up
the
double
mountain
stood
varied
by
water
and
by
wood
he
saw
the
herbage
thickly
grow
the
bubbling
springs
and
far
below
he
saw
the
semicircular
fount
that
like
a
bent
bow
skirts
the
mount
he
saw
the
desert
spread
beneath
like
an
extended
vale
of
death
he
saw
the
blue
sky
far
above
light
up
in
one
bright
blaze
of
love
a
burst
of
sunshine
fell
on
him
to
which
all
other
light
was
dim
he
heard
again
that
still
small
voice
which
made
his
inmost
heart
rejoice
it
was
the
lord
and
power
he
gave
elijah
to
anoint
and
save
thrice
blessed
mount
thou
art
a
sign
a
type
of
penitence
divine
in
darkness
and
in
fear
we
wander
in
the
desert
drear
of
sin
and
doubt
the
welcome
light
of
truth
breaks
sudden
on
our
sight
the
heart
becomes
a
hallowed
dome
where
holy
feelings
find
a
home
for
there
the
law
of
god
secure
makes
every
thought
and
impulse
pure
repentance
may
be
slow
to
bring
comfort
and
healing
on
its
wing
the
doubting
sinner
in
despair
asks
trembling
in
a
hurried
prayer
if
guilt
like
his
of
foulest
trace
can
hope
for
pardon
and
for
grace
but
when
such
doubts
are
swept
away
the
still
small
voice
of
truth
bears
sway
for
jesus
died
and
rose
again
to
free
the
world
from
guilt
and
pain
jesus
the
only
son
of
god
like
moses
takes
the
gospel
rod
and
strikes
the
barren
rock
within
hardened
by
wickedness
and
sin
whence
springs
a
living
well
to
free
the
thirsty
soul
from
misery
he
like
elijah
from
his
cave
came
to
the
world
with
power
to
save
and
israel
trusting
to
his
aid
shall
innocent
and
pure
be
made
redeemed
shall
reach
the
heavenly
land
supported
by
his
mighty
hand
written
beneath
an
elm
a
city
under
thy
shadow
how
many
recline
who
never
knew
rest
the
or
vine
they
pass
from
the
banquet
the
mall
and
the
mart
here
they
meet
here
they
mingle
never
to
part
who
comes
from
the
porch
with
colourless
vest
and
faded
black
coat
once
the
minister
best
the
mattock
and
shovel
support
him
like
staves
as
he
totters
familiarly
over
the
graves
is
the
hoary
old
sexton
whose
home
has
been
here
since
the
days
of
his
boyhood
and
now
he
is
sere
these
mounds
are
his
world
he
can
name
all
the
lairs
as
a
monarch
his
realms
or
a
merchant
his
wares
yet
though
he
apportions
a
dwelling
for
all
and
delights
when
he
handles
the
mattock
and
pall
though
his
thin
hairs
are
gray
and
though
feeble
his
pace
he
for
himself
yet
has
chosen
a
place
thou
wert
here
when
his
sire
did
this
office
fulfil
when
the
son
too
is
gone
thou
wilt
blossom
here
still
how
strange
that
the
grass
and
the
trees
and
the
weeds
flourish
best
on
that
spot
whence
corruption
proceeds
on
thy
trunk
some
rude
sculptor
has
carved
out
his
name
idle
labour
for
fleeting
and
false
is
such
fame
lo
wherever
we
look
there
is
charactered
stone
but
to
whom
is
the
dust
each
commemorates
known
oh
bury
me
not
by
the
multitude
side
i
would
shun
them
in
death
as
in
life
i
avoid
where
the
loathsome
newt
creeps
the
rank
hemlock
shade
is
not
where
i
would
that
my
bones
should
be
laid

bear
me
away
to
the

sea

heave
me
afar
its

my

never

rot
where

a

of

alas

my

me
out

the

my

wail
a
rude
rugged

with

where

never

where

never

where
the
gleam
of
the

falls
with
withering
blight
and
a
desolate
darkness
comes
with
the
night
where
the

roars
like

and
the

the

the

it
oft
in

to
sing

made

for

to
pray
and
praise
and
lift
the
soul
above
this
sordid
earth
and
as
a
lark
doth
soar
ascend
into
the
realms
of
truth
and
love
whence
once
the
spirit
came
in
form
of
dove
thither
oh
thither
would
it
wing
its
flight
for
ever
take
its
rest
there
where
there
comes
no
night

the
gleam
of
light
that
passes
the
world
ere
dawn
of
day
that
faintly
flashing
shines
before
the
darkness
is
away
is
not
the
smile
of

the
first
presage
of

the
morning
star
that

the
following
verses
were
suggested
by
the
striking
reply
of
a
protestant
minister
who
was
about
to
proceed
to
ireland
to
labour
among
the
deluded
and
ignorant
popish
peasantry
and
who
on
being
warned
by
a
friend
of
the
personal
danger
he
thereby
incurred
nobly
answered
i
am
immortal
till
my
work
is
done
what
nerves
the
soldier
in
the
field
when
foes
are
raging
nigh
what
makes
him
proudly
scorn
to
yield
though
numbers
round
him
die
the
faith
that
heaven
directs
each
ball
and
course
that
it
shall
run
is
that
he
knows
he
will
not
fall
until
his
work
be
done
what
makes
the
sailor
on
the
wreck
when
storms
are
frowning
near
bear
up
with
heart
and
form
erect
his
bosom
free
from
fear
is
that
he
feels
that
god
is
by
to
shield
him
like
a
son
is
that
he
knows
he
will
not
die
until
his
work
be
done
god
holds
the
winds
as
by
a
rein
which
still
they
must
obey
the
ocean
fierce
he
doth
restrain
by
his
sway
the
hand
that
bears
the
planets
high
upholds
the
fulgent
sun
has
fixed
the
hour
that
all
must
die
when
their
set
work
is
done
what
arms
the
martyr
his
fires
to
smile
serene
at
death
and
his
whole
heart
and
soul
inspires
with
faith
until
the
victor
crown
is
gained
the
laurel
wreath
is
won
th
oppressor
fury
is
restrained
his
work
must
first
be
done
what
leads
christ
servant
still
to
dare
all
dangers
for
his
sake
and
with
unshaken
firmness
bear
ills
that
the
boldest
shake
the
trust
that
god
is
ever
nigh
to
prosper
what
begun
to
send
a
blessing
from
on
high
upon
his
work
when
done
and
when
the
good
fight
he
has
fought
his
earthly
struggles
he
finds
the
recompense
he
sought
where
grief
is
felt
no
more
is
then
he
gains
th
appointed
prize
his
triumph
is
begun
he
lives
immortal
in
the
skies
when
all
his
work
is
done

when
from
its
of
clay
the
spirit
is
unbound
when
one
we
love
is
borne
away
to
the
lone
narrow
mound
we
feel
as
if
the
charm
were
gone
that
renders
life
so
dear
and
as
a
darkening
cloud
were
thrown
all
our
prospects
here
and
when
died
we
mourned
for
him
as
only
they
could
mourn
who
felt
as
if
a
precious
limb
were
from
the
body
torn
gentle
and
kind
and
always
true
revered
wherever
known
no

his

knew

brought
at

release
the

that
gave
to
us

grief
to
him
was
lasting
peace
we
bore
him
to
his
grave
to
sleep
but
not
alone
to
kindred
dust
his
dust
we
gave
to
mingle
with
his
own
to
teach
us
that
our
home
is
not
here
where
we
seek
to
live
but
that
we
have
a
happier
lot
than
aught
this
world
can
give
death
comes
and
when
right
understood
his
lesson

sabbath
morn
on
sabbath
morn
one
feels
exalted
the
world
and
longs
to
go
forth
to
the
house
of
god
and
as
the
slow
and
solemn
on
him
steals
he
seems
to
tread
the
height
of
heaven
rise
with
his
risen
lord
and
there
pour
out
his
soul
in
prayer
and
worship
with
the

and
joy
and

who
said
the

on

should
build

on

eve
how
sad
yet
sweet
the
thoughts
that
come
into
the
mind
unbid
but
not
unwelcome
and
which
find
communion
there
and
to
its
solace
add
the
world
seems
bright
no
more
its
witching
charms
are
gone
its
voice
is
dumb
vainly
its
pleasures
to
the
soul
say
come
the
wish
for
their
enjoyment
now
is
thoughts
of
the
dead
are
they
which
then
we
feel
low
whispering
to
the
heart
telling
that
we
like
them
must
soon
depart
and
with
them
go
to
dull
and
cold
decay
how
strange
it
is
in
sooth
that
sabbath
morn
and
eve
should
to
the
breast
weary
with
cares
of
life
bring
thoughts
of
rest
strong
proof
of
its
great
purpose
and
its
truth
dreams

no
golden
dreams

quiet
streams

points

guide
his

from
every

when

that

a

like

in
its
downward
pace
the
landmarks
of
its
upward
race
no
wisdom
from

it
earns

to

echoed
now

as
before
its
strain
for
warning

for

is
in
vain
and
hearts
on
which
has
come
the
early
blight

slight
and
scattered
flowers

and

and
trusts
forsaken

men
visions
false

still

that

truth

which

death
forgotten
undistinguishable

absorbed
as
if

were
tranced
in
that
vengeful
light
which

the

and
what
has
been
a

is
now
a

thus
could
doom
a

so
beautiful
as
ours
was
ere
man
sinned
the
waters
sweeping
like
a
mighty
wind
to
whelm
the
earth
from

hurled
all

aghast
its

changed
a

afar
its
lurid
gleam
the
fountains
of
the

while
a
fierce
earthquake
thro

ranged
shattering
the
mountains
in
its
how
vain
was
then
the
strength
of
man
as
poor
his
pride
to
stem
the
onsweep
of
that
ceaseless
tide
which
desolation
spread
mount
and
plain
anguish
and
terror
madness
and
despair
took
hold
on
all
before
they
perished
there
a
towering
rock
whose
shadow
in

was
hailed
by
weary
ones
a

brief
shelter
on

crowding
from

build
their

on

as

madly
brave

strong
to
smite
is
also
strong
to

high
a
buried

to

still

a
kneeling
angel
drops
a

and
thou
wert
at
my
side
yonder
sunny
brae
on
yonder
sunny
brae
we
met
amid
the
summer
flowers
and
never
can
my
heart
forget
the
rapture
of
those
hours
when
she
i
loved
forsook
her
home
and
there
with
me
did
stray
oh
oft
delighted
did
we
roam
on
yonder
sunny
brae
the
gushing
of
the
waterfall
the
sunshine
of
the
sky
the
bloom
the
balm
and
more
than
all
the
sparkle
of
her
eye
brought
to
my
heart
a
blissful
tide
that
drove
all
care
away
and
i
was
happy
at
her
side
on
yonder
sunny
brae
was
there
i
breathed
my
fondest
vow
nor
told
my
love
in
vain
and
i
am
happy
with
her
now
though
years
have
passed
since
then
no
sweeter
scene
my
eyes
shall
see
though
far
my
steps
should
stray
there
not
a
spot
so
dear
to
me

yonder
sunny
brae

grace
adam
was
a
farmer
daughter
her
youth
in
the
far
west
was
spent
where
mississippi
mighty
water
rolls
like
a
flood
that
will
have
vent
she
was
a
blooming
country
maiden
like
those
one
sees
in
market
towns
with
egg
and
butter
baskets
laden
dressed
in
their
smartest
hats
and
gowns
in
household
work
and
dairy
labours
her
time
passed
pleasantly
away
a
pattern
she
to
all
the
neighbours
healthy
and
cheerful
as
the
day
grace
adam
was
a
farmer
daughter
some
share
of
beauty
she
could
boast
and
lovers
near
and
far
off
sought
her
each
striving
who
could
flatter
most
from
them
all
her
heart
selected
one
gentle
youth
who
seemed
sincere
he
was
by
every
one
respected
and
more
it
needs
not
saying
here
within
an
outfield
stood
an
only
old
and
dead
its
branches
bare
and
bleached
and
lonely
an
eagle
built
its
nest
amid
forsook
the
mountain
summit
hoary
the
beetling
cliff
above
the
sea
sought
not
the
forests
of
missouri
but
sheltered
on
this
shattered
tree
and
oft
to
see
this
noble
creature
many
there
came
from
parts
thereby
training
its
young
as
is
its
nature
to
spread
their
wings
and
upward
fly
among
the
rest
a
student
rambling
in
woods
and
meadows
also
came
in
search
of
useful
knowledge
scrambling
wherever
he
could
find
the
same
grace
adam
was
a
farmer
daughter
her
father
had
approved
her
choice
for
duty
and
her
feelings
taught
her
best
to
have
her
parents
voice
oft
as
the
summer
sunset
glowing
came
down
in
splendour
the
west
the
lovers
forth
together
going
would
wander
to
the
eagle
nest
and
there
in
courtship
sweet
and
prudent
the
happy
hours
fast
slipt
away
and
often
there
too
came
the
student
to
watch
the
birds
at
close
of
day
and
so
they
soon
became
acquainted
he
knew
they
were
betrothed
before
but
while
their
future
bliss
painted
object
still
was
to
explore
the
longed
for
yet
dreaded
by
maidens
fair
at
last
came
round
grace
adam
and
her
love
were
wedded
with
hope
and
every
blessing
crowned
their
home
was
in
a
distant
city
far
far
from
where
her
youth
was
spent
where
mississippi
water
mighty
pours
like
a
flood
that
will
have
vent
and
never
more
the
lordly
river
or
its
green
banks
was
grace
to
see
the
farm
no
more
and
never
the
lonely
shattered
eagle
tree
new
duties
claimed
now
her
attention
new
feelings
rose
at
name
of
wife
and
as
time
passed
she
ceased
to
mention
the
loved
scenes
of
her
early
life
some
years
had
gone
and
she
could
gather
her
children
round
about
her
knee
long
since
in
churchyard
lay
her
father
and
fallen
was
the
eagle
tree
and
now
in
course
of
worldly
changes
another
town
their
home
became
for
business
turns
the
hinges
of
man
condition
and
his
aim
and
there
they
settled
growing
older
but
grace
aright
years
passing
read
for
the
grey
hairs
appearing
told
her
time
left
its
shadow
on
her
head
years
twenty
since
the
farmer
daughter
left
the
scenes
where
her
youth
was
spent
where
mississippi
mighty
water
rolls
like
a
flood
that
will
have
vent
within
that
town
broke
out
a
fever
smiting
alike
the
rich
and
poor
was
typhus
grim
death
surest
lever
to
turn
the
churchyards
and
many
with
grief
and
watching
at
couch
of
those
oppressed
with
pains
a
hurried
hour
of
slumber
snatching
woke
with
the
fever
in
their
veins
spared
not

passed
not

swift
grave

as
they
lie
lamented
many
a
one
his
dearest
borne
to
the
house
whence
no
retrace
mourned
high
and
low
for
friends
the
nearest
soon
carried
to
their
resting
place
a
time
of
gloom
and
doubt
and
terror
a
time
of
sorrow
and
dismay
the
breath
of
death
upon
life
mirror
all
ghastly
and
infectious
lay
a
time
of
judgment
when
god
dealings
make
the
most
careless
cry
to
him
a
time
to
try
the
human
feelings
when
even
hope
grows
faint
and
dim
just
at
the
last
when
near
expending
its
baleful
force
ere
sped
away
grace
caught
the
fever
while
attending
a
smitten
neighbour
as
she
lay
grief
in
the
house
but
late
so
cheerful
pain
on
the
heart
but
late
so
light
her
husband
and
her
children
tearful
watched
her
sickbed
day
and
night
beat
low
the
pulse
with
languid
movement
and
stopped
the
functions
of
the
brain
no
sign
her
eye
gave
of
improvement
as
day
and
night
return
again
hastened
the
doctor
if
yet
human
aid
might
avail
to
save
her
life
he
saw
and
knew
the
suffering
woman
although
not
as
a
wedded
wife
years
twenty
since
the
farmer
daughter
had
met
the
student
at
the
tree
where
mississippi
mighty
water
rolls
like
a
full
flood
to
the
sea
bent
near
the
doctor
then
and
laid
he
his
hand
upon
her
wasted
breast
and
with
low
cheerful
whisper
said
he
no
more
words
than
the
eagle
nest
the
change
was
sudden
and
amazing
opened
her
eyes
and
closed
again
and
like
the
keel
of
vessel
grazing
the
ground
grated
her
teeth
in
twain
gasped
a
long
breath
as
if
a
struggle
were
going
on
as
night
with
morn
no
sound
made
but
a
low
faint
guggle
like
cry
of
infant
newly
born
a
smile
passed
her
features
sunken
grasped
she
the
hand
beside
her
then
remembrance
just
as
one
strove
to
retrace
its
course
again
ah
then
came
back
the
faces
of
her
young
days
upon
her
mind
the
scenes
of
long
ago
in
traces
all
clear
and
full
and
well
defined
she
saw
her
father
as
he
taught
her
her
youthful
lessons
at
his
knee
where
mississippi
mighty
water
rolls
like
a
full
flood
to
the
sea
she
saw
her
mother
too
beside
her
long
long
since
taken
to
her
rest
and
then
as
opened
memory
wider
she
stood
beneath
the
eagle
nest
with
him
she
loved
in
courtship
prudent
and
of
love
sweetest
cup
she
drank
she
saw
again
the
youthful
student
all
that
came
after
was
a
blank
thus
ever
memory
touched
can
bring
time
with
its
past
feelings
into
light
and
thus
the
sweet
joys
of
her
came
rushing
thickly
on
her
sight
thus
too
doth
roused
imagination
vibrate
the
tender
chords
that
bind
the
wide
links
of
association
within
the
chambers
of
the
mind
then
turned
the
fever
as
the
meeting
of
the
free
air
upon
her
brain
her
pulse
resumed
a
quickened
beating
revolved
the
wheels
of
life
again
and
day
by
day
she
gained
new
strength
then
beneath
the
doctor
care
and
skill
able
to
quit
her
bed
at
length
then
was
this
she
loved
to
talk
of
still
that
when
death
dart
did
her
hover
and
she
could
find
no
sleep
or
rest
was
this
that
made
her
to
recover
the
simple
words
the
eagle
nest
the
advent
of
truth
a
time
there
is
though
far
its
dawn
may
be
and
shadows
thick
are
brooding
on
the
main
when
like
the
sun
upspringing
from
the
sea
truth
shall
arise
with
freedom
in
its
train
and
light
upon
its
forehead
as
a
star
upon
the
brow
of
heaven
to
shed
its
rays
among
all
people
they
are
and
shower
upon
them
calm
and
happy
days
as
sunshine
comes
with
healing
on
its
wing
after
long
nights
of
sorrow
and
unrest
solace
and
peace
and
sympathy
to
bring
to
the
grieved
spirit
and
unquiet
breast
no
more
shall
then
be
heard
the
slave
deep
groan
nor
man
man
inhumanity
deplore
all
strife
shall
cease
and
war
shall
be
unknown
and
the
world
golden
age
return
once
more
and
nations
now
that
with
oppression
hand
are
to
the
dust
of
earth
with
sorrow
bowed
shall
then
erect
in
fearless
vigour
stand
and
with
recovered
freedom
shout
aloud
along
with
truth
wisdom
her
shall
come
they
two
are
never
far
apart
at
their
approach
to
some
lone
cavern
sin
shall
cowering
flee
as
stricken
to
the
heart
right
shall
then
temper
justice
as
is
meet
it
should
and
justice
give
to
right
its
own
might
shall
its
sword
throw
underneath
its
feet
and
tyranny
unkinged
fall
off
its
throne
then
let
us
live
in
hope
and
still
prepare
us
and
our
children
for
the
end
that
they
instruct
may
those
who
after
them
shall
heir
to
watch
and
wait
the
coming
of
that
day
lines
suggested
by
a
walk
in
a
garden
balmy
as
the
dew
from
its
own
blossoms
and
soothing
as
the
fragrance
it
creates
comes
the
sweet
influence
of
this
summer
eve
to
my
heart
there
is
a
breeze
moving
amid
the
foliage
soft
and
low
as
cradled
murmur
from
a
babe
asleep
it
is
a
time
for
holy
thoughts
to
spring
and
contemplation
fill
the
awakened
mind
lo
a
bright
sunbeam
stands
heaven
and
earth
taking
its
farewell
look
ere
day
departs
and
seeking
still
to
light
the
gloom
below
as
hope
even
when
the
darkness
comes
and
joy
hath
fled
to
cheer
the
heart
still
lingering
smiles
and
when
it
goes
ah
no
it
all
goes
the
sunbeam
fades
a
moment
and
its
light
all
shed
dies
swiftly
shone
and
but
hope
blest
hope
when
it
seems
away
is
near
evermore
near
it
can
not
live
apart
is
wedded
to
the
soul
for
aye
god
joined
them
twain
and
nought
can
sunder
them
near
ever
near
and
ever
bringing
peace
groping
among
the
dark
things
of
man
spirit
and
shedding
the
troubled
mind
its
light
as
a
stray
ray
of
sunshine
wanders
the
shattered
arches
of
a
fallen
ruin
ere
sunset
leaves
the
world
and
sinks
behind
the
illumined
ocean
let
me
muse
awhile
was
in
a
garden
that
that
hideous
thing
sin
first
was
born
accurst
and
now
all
through
the
wide
wide
universe
it
ranges
fierce
where
man
has
placed
his
foot
its
trace
is
seen
the
serpent
slimy
trail
is
everywhere
disfiguring
polluting
and
destroying
death
following
in
its
track
inseparably
but
oh
my
soul
be
humbled
yet
rejoice
it
was
too
in
a
garden
that
the
great
the
only
propitiatory
sacrifice
for
sin
commenced
its
consummation
when
the
man
christ
jesus
swat
for
thee
great
drops
of
blood
even
he
the
second
person
of
the
godhead
and
prayed
in
agony
that
the
cup
might
pass
if
so
his
father
willed
but
none
on
earth
or
yet
in
heaven
could
drink
it
none
save
him
and
when
the
sacrifice
was
all
complete
on
calvary
and
satisfied
was
justice
mercy
and
hope
held
out
their
hands
to
man
and
in
christ
name
showed
him
redemption
way
the
shame
and
misery
that
adam
felt
in
eden
garden
when
the
first
great
sin
was
challenged
was
as
nothing
to
compare
with
the
deep
agony
which
on
that
night
that
dreadful
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
our
surety
felt
when
in
gethsemane
he
took
upon
himself
to
pay
the
full
ransom
and
penalty
of
that
first
sin
which
adam
sinned
and
all
his
race
in
him
of
that
first
sin
did
adam
put
the
blame
on
eve
the
woman
whom
thou
gavest
me
eve
on
the
serpent
shifted
it
and
proud
was
he
that
he
had
circumvented
both
doomed
on
his
womb
to
crawl
in
dust
and
bruised
his
head
by
woman
seed
his
christ
took
upon
himself
the
sin
and
all
its
anguish
nor
like
adam
vainly
strove
to
shift
it
to
another
knowing
well
no
other
could
redeem
it
but
himself
sinless
a
sacrifice
for
sin
that
sin
might
from
the
souls
of
men
be
washed
away
was
for
that
sin
and
its
infeftments
wide
that
jesus
died
that
its
entail
cut
off
might
be
from
adam
and
his
lineage
far
as
generations
yet
to
come
extend
and
man
restored
to
his
lost
paradise
no
flaming
sword
waves
at
its
portals
now
entrance
to
bar
to
the
redeemed
on
earth
no
angels
guard
the
gates
to
keep
them
shut
but
open
ever
are
they
to
the
elect
and
there
bright
angels
stand
with
joy
to
welcome
all
who
come
in
christ
name
in
but
now
the
sun
hath
bade
the
world
good
night
and
gathering
darkness
warns
me
to
my
home
sonnet
sunshine
on
the
old
forest
bright
the
sunrays
play
and
from
the
boughs
hang
tinging
the
green
leaves
with
golden
light
that
downward
interweaves
past
branch
and
stem
finding
itself
a
way
and
on
the
greensward
and
among
the
fern
some
trace
of
sunshine
still
we
can
discern
a
sunbeam
scattered
droppings
gone
astray
among
the
where
they
nestle
close
within
the
long
grass
or
the
woodland
moss
making
for
earth
a
dress
with
colours
gay
oh
on
our
pathway
thus
may
sunshine
fall
and
like
the
little
flowers
our
hopes
still
bloom
a
share
of
it
at
least
if
not
it
all
to
light
the
darkness
and
to
cheer

and
untimely
grave
where
flew
the
eagle
in
its
wide
domain
there
was
he
ever
foremost
in
the
fight
leading
his
band
of
heroes
strong
in
might
to
conquest
still
in
switzerland
and
spain
and
where
the
rhine
majestic
to
the
main
through
many
fertile
lands
doth
proudly
flow
his
prowess
won
applause
even
from
the
foe
midst
blood
and
carnage
on
each
battle
plain
high
rose
his
genius
with
the
tide
of
war
his
country
annals
of
his
valour
tell
impetuous
as
the
torrent
when
the
swell
of

fierce
pours
onward
from
afar
and
sweeps
before
it
every
stop

his
sword
flashed
with
its

there
victory
followed
closely
on
the
way

was
marked
by
many

his
courage
knew
when
yet
his
early
deeds
foretold
the
fame
that
soon
would
throw
a
halo
round
his
name
manheim

it
too

though
only

their

in

in

which
the

they

in

the

asks

that
tell

sunshine
being
on

the
harbingers
of
light
and

heat
that
make

make
rich
the

through

from

gone
all
gone
the

are
flown
there
nought

oh
now
to

the

in
the

the
psalms
of
nature
singers
always
good
bring
solace
to
the
year
oh
for
one
glimpse
of
sunshine
to
remind
the
earth
of
summer
ever
bland
and
kind
human
conduct
why
is
it
that
the
heart
of
man
so
full
is
of
vagary
that
when
he
told
what
right
he
jerks
the
rein
and
does
contrary
like
skittish
horse
or
stubborn
pig
or
other
creature
that
in
the
public
highways
shows
its
vile
and
perverse
nature
there
many
a
lesson
taught
to
man
but
little
does
he
mind
them
many
the
warning
given
to
him
he
throws
them
all
behind
him
but
let
me
a
short
tale
relate
instead
of
moralising
you
prize
it
more
i
dare
to
say
than
any
such
premising
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
hills
the
countryside
looked
sweeter
and
brighter
and
more
beautiful
than
i
can
tell
in
metre
it
was
the
of
the
year
that
pleasant
balmy
season
when
freshness
passes
the
earth
and
come
the
buds
the
trees
on
when
nature
young
looks
and
is
young
but
though
she
dresses
gaily
the
time
grows
old
for
time
like
man
grows
older
daily
daily
ah
me
that
men
should
be
so
weak
as
not
to
read
the
lesson
ripe
fruits
are
offered
them
but
they
the
garbage
love
to
mess
on
one
day
along
a
country
road
with
hedge
and
hawthorn
bristling
a
country
lad
was
passing
and
in
merry
mood
was
whistling
stout
was
he
and
his
joints
well
knit
and
firm
as
timber
but
light
withal
and
agile
too
no
sapling
yet
was
limber
anon
a
horseman
came
that
way
who
sat
on
horseback
rarely
this
the
horse
knew
as
well
as
he
and
so
had
bolted
fairly
the
young
man
eyed
him
as
he
came
and
was
by
no
means
idle
for
as
he
passed
he
leapt
in
front
and
caught
him
by
the
bridle
the
horse
reared
back
and
with
the
shock
his
rider
fell
right
over
among
the
mud
and
well
for
him
the
place
was
soft
as
clover
brought
to
his
feet
without
a
hurt
but
all
very
muddy
he
thanked
the
lad
to
find
he
sound
was
and
unbloody
he
was
a
thin
spare
man
and
past
and
looking
sickly
not
that
his
health
was
touched
at
all
or
that
his
limbs
were
weakly
but
he
had
been
for
many
years
in
towns
a
constant
dweller
confined
to
business
close
and
this
on
health
is
oft
a
teller
he
had
an
eye
for
bales
and
goods
and
turnings
of
the
market
but
for
the
country
picturesque
his
shadow
rare
did
dark
it
he
rode
out
had
to
breathe
the
air
and
give
his
nerves
a
bracing
his
steed
unruly
had
become
his
horsemanship
disgracing
the
countryman
pulled
up
some
grass
no
readier
thing
appearing
and
rubbed
him
down
in
ostler
style
the
mud
from
off
him
clearing
and
then
for
having
saved
his
life
to
cut
my
tale
the
shorter
he
offered
him
as
a
reward
to
take
him
as
his
porter
and
if
he
showed
capacity
to
give
him
education
to
make
him
fit
in
course
of
time
to
fill
a
higher
station
the
youth
agreed
for
he
thought
while
handing
back
the
bridle
he
like
the
change
besides
just
then
he
happened
to
be
idle
in
glasgow
busy
city
now
behold
this
country
clown
bred
first
porter
and
then
junior
clerk
and
learning
to
be
town
bred
years
passed
the
sun
shines
once
a
day
but
days
make
years
and
every
sun
that
rises
counts
one
thus
time
flows
on
as
water
rivery
through
all
gradations
of
the
desk
the
youth
still
true
and
steady
had
risen
till
from
senior
clerk
he
partner
was
already
the
merchant
now
as
commerce
had
to
long
held
him
resolved
to
take
his
ease
at
last
and
came
to
business
seldom
the
junior
partner
and
care
of
the
keeping
while
he
himself
had
chosen
to
be
what
called
the
partner
sleeping
the
countryman
no
longer
young
had
toiled
both
late
and
early
and
gained
some
wealth
and
was
his
boast
that
he
had
won
it
fairly
but
with
it
he
had
learnt
betimes
and
aye
the
more
the
faster
some
of
the
city
ways
that
were
not
pleasing
to
his
master
he
had
married
and
was
fond
of
being
hospitable
for
was
his
pride
always
to
have
his
friends
around
his
table
and
so
extravagant
became
to
feasting
much
addicted
and
rich
wines
drinking
which
of
course
his
income
much
restricted
one
night
his
master
was
in
town
and
heard
he
had
a
party
an
old
man
now
not
wanting
sense
but
humorous
and
hearty
yet
this
he
to
himself
oft
thought
he
thought
that
was
a
pity
his
clerk
should
spend
his
money
in
thus
feasting
all
the
city
and
so
resolved
to
call
on
him
and
bring
him
to
his
senses
not
by
a
lecture
commonplace
of
prudence
and
expenses
but
by
a
something
which
he
had
a
sort
of
old
memento
that
in
his
judgment
was
well
worth
of
lectures
grave
a
cento
it
was
a
frosty
night
and
there
had
been
a
fall
of
snow
on
the
slippery
streets
required
great
skill
and
caution
them
to
go
on
with
but
one
fall
he
reached
the
house
the
entrance
well
he
knew
there
sudden
and
unexpected
burst
amidst
the
jovial
crew
there
the
gas
burnt
clear
the
host
looked
blue
and
not
the
lights
as
use
is
when
one
particular
guest
appears
that
no
one
introduces
he
said
lies
the
skeleton
frost
on
one
street
and
another
i
tripped
and
fell
and
where
i
lay
one
skeleton
hugged
his
brother
his
breath
is
on
each
pane
congealed
cold
enters
through
each
portal
how
my
teeth
chatter
with
the
cold
a
sign
that
we
are
mortal
what
this
a
banquet
spread
and
rich
the
wines
all
bright
and
glowing
no
thought
of
this
when
you
i
met
along
the
going
he
then
produced
a
bundle
which
he
opened
with
derision
and
singly
held
up
the
contents
to
their
astonished
vision
there
was
the
wellworn
hairy
cap
the
corderoys
to
back
it
his
host
had
owned
and
there
too
was
his
former
fustian
jacket
these
were
the
clothes
the
country
lad
had
on
at
their
first
meeting
and
these
he
now
brought
forth
to
be
to
him
his
present
greeting
that
he
might
pause
in
his
career
of
jollity
and
revel
lest
in
his
age
reduced
he
should
be
to
his
former
level
is
strange
that
human
conduct
oft
so
reckless
is
and
hollow
that
when
the
right
path
reason
shows
it
seeks
the
wrong
to
follow
the
master
having
said
and
done
quick
vanished
from
them
after
the
host
attempted
at
the
time
to
turn
it
off
with
laughter
next
morn
reflection
made
him
take
the
hint
and
to
be
brief
then
though
roughly
put
was
kindly
meant
he
turned
a
new
leaf
then
moral
to
be
of
any
use
reproof
still
strong
should
be
and
home
put
a
lecture
grave
or
saying
wise
the
mind
is
quickly
from
put
instead
of
moral
saws
facts
personal
lay
stress
on
and
like
a
surgeon
probing
deep
reform
is
in
the
lesson
courtship
lines
oh
let
not
sorrow
cloud
thine
eye
or
doubt
oppress
thy
heart
for
love
like
truth
can
never
lie
nor
truth
like
love
depart
to
be
mine
own
i
chosen
thee
from
all
the
world
deems
fair
and
i
vowed
thine
own
to
be
then
wherefore
cherish
care
thou
canst
not
think
a
love
like
mine
could
to
thee
cause
pain
or
make
thy
gentle
heart
repine
that
it
has
loved
in
vain
thee
still
mine
eyes
desire
to
see
like
sunlight
from
above
for
all
my
heart
is
full
of
thee
and
all
my
heart
is
love
i
canna
get
my
mouth
about
it
it
lies
so
deeply
on
my
heart
that
aye
when
trying
to
divulge
it
my
thoughts
fly
somehow
all
apart
were
i
to
learn
the
best
confession
that
by
pen
of
man
was
writ
to
try
to
speak
it
in
her
presence
i
should
not
have
the
power
or
wit
as
in
the
rose
opening
petals
devotion
pure
is
ever
spread
so
in
the
flushings
of
my
countenance
she
my
heart
feelings
must
have
read
oh
gladly
anywhere
i
venture
dare
anything
to
prove
it
true
but
to
disclose
my
ardent
passion
is
just
the
thing
i
canna
do
i
canna
get
my
mouth
about
it
it
lies
so
deeply
on
my
heart
that
aye
when
trying
to
divulge
it
my
thoughts
fly
somehow
all
apart

the

his
volume

of
sonnets
on

verse
thy

the
poet
i
was
told
yesterday
by
one
with
wise
solemn
aspect
and
wrinkles
his
eyes
that
poetry
is
an
idle
trade
alack
he
had
a
good
black
coat
upon
his
back
and
deemed
himself
respectable
he
said
too
that
he
who
verses
writes
will
never
do
well
in
the
world
that
his
character
is
gone
and
he
himself
no
better
than
a
drone
so
having
said
he
walked
away
well
pleased
now
that
a
man
i
say
whose
mind
diseased
has
he
in
summer
ever
watched
a
rose
burst
into
blossoming
and
as
it
grows
more
and
more
beautiful
sweeten
all
the
air
with
its
rich
perfume
poetry
was
there
a
sunbeam
thrown
across
the
clouds
that
makes
them
glow
with
light
ineffable
to
eyes
from
earth
below
a
small
wave
of
the
sea
when
the
vast
ocean
waits
the
coming
of
the
storm
that
slightly
agitates
its
surface
passing
as
when
of
danger
near
first
made
aware
the
roused
lion
though
not
in
fear
looks
up
the
watchfire
then
kindling
in
his
eye
his
mane
scarcely
as
yet
moved
nor
erected
high
his
head
but
his
proud
glance
circling
keen
rapid
stern
there
poetry
is
seen
by
one
that
can
discern
a
priest
of
nature
own
one
she
herself
ordains
the
poet
walks
in
brightness
and
still
new
blessings
gains
the
sky
above
hath
in
it
more
beauty
to
his
sight
than
to
the
world
it
shines
in
its
canopy
of
light
the
flowers
his
kindred
are
that
grow
in
fields
remote
they
waken
in
his
heart
the
pure
wellsprings
of
thought
they
speak
to
him
alone
with
low
and
whispering
voice
like
gentle
maiden
to
the
lover
of
her
choice
and
none
but
he
can
tell
what
is
it
that
they
say
for
a
most
sweet
communion
is
their
to
cheer
his
way
the
ocean
in
its
vastness
he
loves
too
as
he
sees
it
driven
by
the
tempest
or
slumbering
in
the
breeze
it
brings
into
his
vision
the
coming
of
that
day
when
time
within
eternity
shall
merge
itself
away
the
forest
trees
antique
are
his
familiar
friends
with
the
spirit
of
the
woods
his
own
for
ever
blends
and
voices
of
the
past
with
fancies
of
old
times
do
their
murmurings
recall
which
he
fondly
puts
in
rhymes
echoes
of
distant
lands
beyond
the
western
sea
or
in
the
burning
east
they
chance
to
be
are
brought
to
him
at
night
and
cheer
his
spirit
then
when
sleep
forsakes
the
eyes
of
worldly
men
and
ever
for
his
kind
doth
his
spirit
warmly
yearn
and
his
verses
speak
of
things
which
only
he
can
learn
the
human
heart
and
all
its
feelings
hopes
and
fears
all
that
it
fondly
loves
all
that
it
blindly
fears
its
sympathies
affections
its
duties
and

he

if
in

his

it
might
have

so
that
he
had
been

born
and
looked
solemn
like
his
scorners
and
had
gravely
worn
a

coat

of

cut

smoothed

shook

thou

still
molest
our

till

fill
slow
oh
time
the
rounded
cup
of
numbered
hours
that
set
us
soon
shall
our

be
gathered
up
and
even
our
own
forget
us
then
shine

on

and

and

is
heaven
that
sends
the
brightness
still
earth
only
gives
the
shadow
the
early
dead
my
youngest
daughter
died
march
aged
she
rests
within
her
little
grave
a
bud
of
promise
too
soon
taken
and
wanting
the
sweet
smile
she
gave
we
deem
ourselves
as
if
forsaken
life
wore
for
her
no
luring
guise
she
tasted
time
and
found
it
dreary
calmly
she
closed
her
gentle
eyes
as
one
that
falls
asleep
aweary
like
to
a
star
whose
little
ray
is
quenched
when
is
brightly
shining
or
as
a
flower
that
fades
away
while
yet
its
bloom
tells
nought
of
pining
and
when
her
latest
sigh
was
spent
and
fled
her
spirit
to
its
giver
we
felt
as
with
it
also
went
a
lapsed
part
of
our
heart
for
ever
oh
twice
before
we
knew
the
blight
upon
the
heart
that
deeply
falleth
when
death
for
ever
from
the
sight
of
our
own
life
a
portion
calleth
but
though
it
has
the
power
to
slay
still
is
this
consolation
given
it
can
not
take
the
hope
away
that
we
shall
meet
again
in
heaven
there
is
a
place
of
rest
above
a
home
for
children
there
provided
to
which
away
from
earth
in
love
their
guileless
spirits
still
are
guided
and
when
our
hearts
with
sorrow
sink
and
our
weak
eyes
are
sore
with
weeping
soothe
and
cheer
us
still
to
think
that
they
sweet
watch
are
us
keeping
and
in
the
dark
and
lonely
night
when
sleep
our
eyelids
have
forsaken
we
see
again
the
faces
bright
of
our
three
babes
so
early
taken
a
dirge
mourn
for
the
untimely
dead
early
blossoms
quickly
shed
soon
taken
to
their
long
long
rest
now
there
waves
the
green
grass
thickly
their
breast
on
their
graves
neither
care
nor
sorrow
now
leaves
its
trace
upon
their
brow
nor
can
pain
them
more
molest
for
there
waves
the
green
grass
thickly
their
breast
on
their
graves
little
flowers
their
heads
begem
but
they
can
not
look
at
them
for
death
cold
hand
their
eyes
have
prest
and
there
waves
the
green
grass
thickly
their
breast
on
their
graves
winds
sigh
through
the
shadowing
trees
summer
brings
the
hum
of
bees
but
no
sounds
can
their
ears
invest
where
there
waves
the
green
grass
thickly
their
breast
on
their
graves
still
they
lie
in
their
low
beds
to
sleep
till
the
last
morn
sheds
its
light
upon
their
place
of
rest
now
there
waves
the
green
grass
thickly
their
breast
on
their
graves
a
benediction
god
bless
thee
is
my
fervent
prayer
at
morn
and
eve
from
day
to
day
as
thou
with
anxious
care
thy
children
dear
with
love
alway
god
keep
thee
ever
in
his
grace
and
still
new

on
thee

as
thou
in
thy
embrace
thine
infants
tender
every
hour
god
love
thee
with
the
love
he
shows
still
to
his
own
in
earth
and
heaven
as
thou
with
true
love
those
who
to
thy
keeping
have
been
given
god
guide
thee
still
through
all
thy
days
and
let
no
evil
on
thee
light
as
thou
and
the
ways
of
thy
dear
offspring
day
and
night
god
comfort
thee
in
all
thy
grief
and
ever
thy
sure
hope
remain
as
thou
with
relief
thy
little
ones
in
woe
and
pain
god
cherish
thee
throughout
thy
life
in
weal
and
woe
thy
guardian
be
as
a
mother
and
a
wife
thou
still
hast
cherished
them
and
me
health
oh
what
a
thing
is
health
to
lose
and
what
a
prize
to
gain
most
valued
when
the
spirit
woos
its
coming
back
again
after
long
days
and
restless
nights
reclined
on
weary
bed
how
sweet
when
first
its
blessing
lights
upon
the
aching
head
its
coming
turns
the
life
as
doth
the
ocean
with
its
tide
or
as
the
spring
renews
the
growth
of
what
earth
stores
provide
power
fame
and
with
them
cherished
gold
that
form
man
constant
aim
all
would
be
gladly
overtold
its
halcyon
bliss
to
claim
it
passes
life
and
death
between
from
heaven
own
portals
borne
like
the
sweet
scarce
seen
that
parts
the
night
from
morn
an
emblem
of
the
peace
that
springs
to
chase
away
all
strife
an
earnest
of
the
grace
that
brings
life
to
the
inner
life
the
game
of
life
watching
the
game
of
life
as
daily
played
one
marvels
at
the
blunders
that
are
made
few
trust
to
chance
alone
to
gain
their
aim
but
with
the
means
they
use
is
just
the
same
low
cunning
some
employ
and
call
it
skill
or
substitute
for
reason
headstrong
will
and
when
they
win
the
prize
for
which
they
strive
to
their
own
genius
they
the
credit
give
but
when
they
lose
the
blame
on
fate
is
thrown
they
never
think
the
fault
may
be
their
own
others
who
boast
that
cunning
they
disdain
affect
by
pride
their
purposes
to
gain
objects
do
their
minds
devise
by
which
they
blind
their
own
and
neighbours
eyes
aiming
at
lofty
things
they
highly
rate
their
own
designings
but
they
find
too
late
that
for
success
mere
unassisted
pride
does
not
all
necessary
means
provide
so
thinking
surely
to
promote
their
aim
and
win
the
stake
of
their
ambition
game
but
not
particular
as
to
how
is
played
they
call
pride
contrast
meanness
to
their
aid
yet
though
fortune
should
their
hopes
attend
it
does
not
change
the
matter
in
the
end
meanness
and
pride
may
climb
the
highest
hill
but
pride
and
meanness
they
continue
still
since
life
a
game
where
all
their
part
must
play
reason
and
truth
should
in
it
have
the
sway
or
wanting
these
as
is
too
oft
the
case
folly
and
passion
will
usurp
their
place
when
this
weak
body
dwindles
into
dust
and
man
becomes
the
nothing
that
he
must
how
puny
then
will
to
the
soul
appear
all
that
man
toils
and
struggles
for
when
here
bound
to
the
narrow
aims
and
views
of
earth
at
death
his
spirit
finds
that
all
is
dearth
that
to
this
world
relates
and
well
that
he
makes
time
provide
still
for
eternity
consumption
like
monumental
patience
see
decay
watching
the
slowly
wear
away
while
death
at
hand
amid
her
waning
powers
counts
as
a
monk
his
beads
her
numbered
hours
upon
her
brow
which
the
tresses
wave
the
cold
dew
gathers
dankly
of
the
grave
and
in
her
pale
mild
eyes
a
lustre
shines
as
if
her
spirit
as
she
wastes
refines
while
ever
and
anon
her
sunken
cheek
life
fading
beauties
delicately
streak
as
the
departing
sun
from
ocean
brinks
sheds
out
its
glories
brightly
ere
it
sinks
change
grief
and
change
and
sure
decay
all
on
earth
are
doomed
to
know
what
the
past
memorials
say
must
the
present
undergo
time
but
shifts
his
glass
about
and
the
sands
their
aims
adjust
in
creation
bounds
throughout
all
that
is
returns
to
dust
on
the
bud
and
on

of

thus
amid

range
man
impatient
of
relief
learns
himself
to
long
for
change
even
though
bringing
with
it
grief
virtue
he
was
a
sage
old
man
who
said
while
in
the
public
way
he
stood
virtue
is
best
of
all
because
without
it
there
is
nothing
good
he
was
no
stoic
who
thus
spoke
a
word
so
practical
and
true
nor
sophist
that
would
grandly
say
what
he
would
attempt
to
do
but
one
of
those
wise
heathen
men
who
reason
followed
as
a
guide
and
by
it
he
was
learned
a
truth
so
humbling
to
mere
human
pride
yet
even
to
him
with
all
the
lore
philosophy
amassed
of
old
was
the
full
meaning
all
unknown
of
what
unaided
reason
told
a
wiser
man
than
he
hath
said
by
god
own
spirit
taught
the
same
that
wisdom
is
the
chiefest
thing
deserving
of
man
fervent
aim
wisdom
and
virtue
both
are
one
and
only
are
attained
aright
in
their
whole
fulness
and
intent
when
sought
in
revelation
light
by
it
the
sage
old
heathen
word
in
all
its
breadth
is
understood
wisdom
is
best
of
all
he
said
without
it
there
is
nothing
good
vain
hopes
vain
is
his
labour
who
begins
to
sow
ere
he
has
well
prepared
the
soil
below
and
vainer
still
his
aim
who
hopes
to
win
to
heaven
before
repenting
of
his
sin
weak
is
his
wish
who
looks
for
full
crops
grown
who
has
prepared
his
land
and
no
seed
sown
but
weaker
still
his
hopes
who
thinks
to
win
to
heaven
with
mere
repentance
of
his
sin
to
till
the
land
and
lay
it
out
for
seeds
and
yet
none
sown
will
bring
forth
nought
but
weeds
and
wanting
grace
to
fill
the
void
within
breeds
with
all
presumptuous
sin
fruitless
his
skill
who
would
a
vessel
steer
without
a
rudder
to
direct
and
veer
more
fruitless
still
his
aim
who
seeks
to
win
to
heaven
when
wanting
prayer
for
light
within
hopeless
his
task
who
seeks
to
safely
go
without
a
chart
the
dangerous
rocks
to
show
more
hopeless
still
his
aim
who
seeks
to
win
to
heaven
when
wanting
faith
to
lead
him
in
the
valley
of
life
in
the
still
midnight
hour
i
sat
alone
within
my
chamber
sunk
in
reverie
no
sound
disturbed
my
musings
all
was
hushed
in
silence
and
in
sleep
the
light
near
done
a
dim
uncertain
flickering
threw
around
the
waning
fire
was
but
a
heap
of
ashes
while
there
and
there
a
feeble
red
remained
that
now
and
then
threw
out
a
fitful
gleam
something
like
slumber
fell
upon
my
eyes
and
a
dream
passed
my
spirit
stealthily
as
in
the
early
grey
of
morn
the
mists
gathered
in
masses
up
the
creep
ere
they
dissolve
before
the
sun
away
remembrance
can
not
all
its
features
tell
though
vivid
and
particular
they
seemed
when
that
dread
vision
on
my
senses
came
and
i
could
trace
the
shadowy
details
as
one
might
mark
a
phantom
army
march
its
last
field
of
battle
ere
it
passed
into
obscurity
could
note
it
then
but
afterwards
can
not
recall
the
place
order
and
rank
of
each
brigade
and
file
methought
i
stood
upon
a
bare
and
overlooked
a
vast
and
fertile
plain
peopled
with
many
multitudes
there
met
men
of
all
tribes
and
nations
that
the
globe
holds
in
its
wide
extent
of
every
kind
the
mongol
the
malayan
and
the
negro
the
red
american
and
caucasian
fair
among
them
evil
strode
ubiquitous
and
threw
its
shadow
it
came
its
jackal
lewd
temptation
went
before
with
angel
face
and
soft
alluring
eyes
while
close
behind
guilt
anguish
care
and
pain
followed
incessantly
and
left
on
all
their
mark
impressed
as
with
hot
iron
seared
as
then
i
looked
upon
the
scene
below
meseemed
that
temptation
came
and
she
came
everywhere
no
spot
escaped
that
many
most
indeed
of
these
vast
crowds
themselves
threw
madly
in
her
way
and
sought
to
win
her
smiles
nor
deemed
them
poisonous
and
once
within
her
meshes
few
had
will
to
fly
them
or
to
manfully
resist
as
a
strong
man
confronts
his
enemy
and
strives
to
overthrow
him
where
they
meet
and
she
the
while
assumed
all
shapes
and
moods
that
suited
were
to
their
intents
and
aims
for
with
a
penetrating
eye
precise
intuitively
still
their
minds
she
knew
tendencies
and
dispositions
and
wore
as
snares
in
readiness
she
had
for
all
the
very
guise
adapted
for
their
lure
but
carefully
concealed
the
stings
they
bore
disease
and
sorrow
on
her
victims
fell
too
late
they
felt
the
curse
that
is
entailed
on
all
who
to
the
tempter
yield
and
thus
become
an
early
prey
to
evil
whose
inheritance
is
misery
and
woe
and
i
beheld
some
the
various
crowds
who
stood
aloof
from
her
and
would
not
be
entangled
with
her
witcheries
or
wiles
these
with
a
resolute
will
refused
to
come
within
her
reach
and
so
escaped
the
first
of
evil
followers
guilt
though
more
or
less
they
had
their
share
of
what
the
others
left
behind
care
pain
and
anguish
for
the
doom
pronounced
on
man
was
on
them
but
they
knew
that
these
to
all
who
hold
out
to
the
end
with
a
pure
conscience
and
unspotted
mind
to
their
endurance
will
be
tempered
still
and
in
due
season
turn
to
lasting
good
which
to
their
spirits
consolation
brought
the
valley
watered
was
with
goodly
rivers
upon
the
banks
of
which
were
many
met
prudence
was
one
and
on
its
grassy
sides
sat
some
who
calculating
every
chance
a
deaf
ear
to
temptation
when
she
came
turned
unseduced
from
their
proprieties
repentance
was
another
near
it
lay
those
who
remorse
felt
and
a
wounded
spirit
seeking
relief
from
agonising
thought
and
racking
beyond
these
two
was
perseverance
where
returning
health
was
found
by
all
who
there
due
time
remained
and
farther
still
with
borders
ever
green
and
fresh
flowers
ever
springing
ever
new
were
two
sweet
rills
virtue
and
faith
their
names
where
