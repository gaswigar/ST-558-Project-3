when
louis
trevelyan
was
years
old
he
had
all
the
world
before
him
where
to
choose
and
among
other
things
he
chose
to
go
to
the
mandarin
islands
and
there
fell
in
love
with
emily
rowley
the
daughter
of
sir
marmaduke
the
governor
sir
marmaduke
rowley
at
this
period
of
his
life
was
a
respectable
public
servant
in
good
repute
who
had
however
as
yet
achieved
for
himself
neither
an
exalted
position
nor
a
large
fortune
he
had
been
governor
of
many
islands
and
had
never
lacked
employment
and
now
at
the
age
of
fifty
found
himself
at
the
mandarins
with
a
salary
of
a
year
living
in
a
temperature
at
which
in
the
shade
is
considered
to
be
cool
with
eight
daughters
and
not
a
shilling
saved
a
governor
at
the
mandarins
who
is
social
by
nature
and
hospitable
on
principle
can
not
save
money
in
the
islands
even
on
a
year
when
he
has
eight
daughters
and
at
the
mandarins
though
hospitality
is
a
duty
the
gentlemen
who
ate
sir
dinners
were
not
exactly
the
men
whom
he
or
lady
rowley
desired
to
welcome
to
their
bosoms
as
nor
when
trevelyan
came
that
way
desirous
of
seeing
everything
in
the
somewhat
indefinite
course
of
his
travels
had
emily
rowley
the
eldest
of
the
flock
then
twenty
years
of
age
seen
as
yet
any
mandariner
who
exactly
came
up
to
her
fancy
and
as
louis
trevelyan
was
a
remarkably
handsome
young
man
who
was
well
connected
who
had
been
ninth
wrangler
at
cambridge
who
had
already
published
a
volume
of
poems
and
who
possessed
a
year
of
his
own
arising
from
various
perfectly
secure
investments
he
was
not
forced
to
sigh
long
in
vain
indeed
the
rowleys
one
and
all
felt
that
providence
had
been
very
good
to
them
in
sending
young
trevelyan
on
his
travels
in
that
direction
for
he
seemed
to
be
a
very
pearl
among
men
both
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
felt
that
there
might
be
objections
to
such
a
marriage
as
that
proposed
to
them
raised
by
the
trevelyan
family
lady
rowley
would
not
have
liked
her
daughter
to
go
to
england
to
be
received
with
cold
looks
by
strangers
but
it
soon
appeared
that
there
was
no
one
to
make
objections
louis
the
lover
had
no
living
relative
nearer
than
cousins
his
father
a
barrister
of
repute
had
died
a
widower
and
had
left
the
money
which
he
had
made
to
an
only
child
the
head
of
the
family
was
a
first
cousin
who
lived
in
cornwall
on
a
moderate
property
a
very
good
sort
of
stupid
fellow
as
louis
said
who
would
be
quite
indifferent
as
to
any
marriage
that
his
cousin
might
make
no
man
could
be
more
independent
or
more
clearly
justified
in
pleasing
himself
than
was
this
lover
and
then
he
himself
proposed
that
the
second
daughter
nora
should
come
and
live
with
them
in
london
what
a
lover
to
fall
suddenly
from
the
heavens
into
such
a
dovecote
i
have
a
to
give
to
either
of
them
said
sir
rowley
it
is
my
idea
that
girls
should
not
have
fortunes
said
trevelyan
at
any
rate
i
am
quite
sure
that
men
should
never
look
for
money
a
man
must
be
more
comfortable
and
i
think
is
likely
to
be
more
affectionate
when
the
money
has
belonged
to
himself
sir
rowley
was
a
gentleman
who
would
have
liked
to
have
handed
over
a
few
thousand
pounds
on
giving
up
his
daughters
but
having
no
thousands
of
pounds
to
hand
over
he
could
not
but
admire
the
principles
of
his
proposed
as
it
was
about
time
for
him
to
have
his
leave
of
absence
he
and
sundry
of
the
girls
went
to
england
with
trevelyan
and
the
wedding
was
celebrated
in
london
by
the
rev
oliphant
outhouse
of
saint
who
had
married
sir
rowley
sister
then
a
small
house
was
taken
and
furnished
in
curzon
street
mayfair
and
the
rowleys
went
back
to
the
seat
of
their
government
leaving
nora
the
second
girl
in
charge
of
her
elder
sister
the
rowleys
had
found
on
reaching
london
that
they
had
lighted
upon
a
pearl
indeed
louis
trevelyan
was
a
man
of
whom
all
people
said
all
good
things
he
might
have
been
a
fellow
of
his
college
had
he
not
been
a
man
of
fortune
he
might
already
so
sir
rowley
was
told
have
been
in
parliament
had
he
not
thought
it
to
be
wiser
to
wait
awhile
indeed
he
was
very
wise
in
many
things
he
had
gone
out
on
his
travels
thus
young
not
in
search
of
excitement
to
kill
beasts
or
to
encounter
he
knew
not
what
novelty
and
amusement
but
that
he
might
see
men
and
know
the
world
he
had
been
on
his
travels
for
more
than
a
year
when
the
winds
blew
him
to
the
mandarins
oh
how
blessed
were
the
winds
and
moreover
sir
rowley
found
that
his
was
well
spoken
of
at
the
clubs
by
those
who
had
known
him
during
his
university
career
as
a
man
popular
as
well
as
wise
not
a
or
a
dry
philosopher
or
a
prig
he
could
talk
on
all
subjects
was
very
generous
a
man
sure
to
be
honoured
and
respected
and
then
such
a
handsome
manly
fellow
with
short
brown
hair
a
nose
divinely
chiselled
an
apollo
mouth
six
feet
high
with
shoulders
and
legs
and
arms
in
proportion
a
pearl
of
pearls
only
as
lady
rowley
was
the
first
to
find
out
he
liked
to
have
his
own
way
but
his
way
is
such
a
good
way
said
sir
marmaduke
he
will
be
such
a
good
guide
for
the
girls
but
emily
likes
her
way
too
said
lady
rowley
sir
marmaduke
argued
the
matter
no
further
but
thought
no
doubt
that
such
a
husband
as
louis
trevelyan
was
entitled
to
have
his
own
way
he
probably
had
not
observed
his
daughter
temper
so
accurately
as
his
wife
had
done
with
eight
of
them
coming
up
around
him
how
should
he
have
observed
their
tempers
at
any
rate
if
there
were
anything
amiss
with
emily
temper
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
find
her
master
in
such
a
husband
as
louis
trevelyan
for
nearly
two
years
the
little
household
in
curzon
street
went
on
well
or
if
anything
was
the
matter
no
one
outside
of
the
little
household
was
aware
of
it
and
there
was
a
baby
a
boy
a
young
louis
and
a
baby
in
such
a
household
is
apt
to
make
things
go
sweetly
the
marriage
had
taken
place
in
july
and
after
the
wedding
tour
there
had
been
a
winter
and
a
spring
in
london
and
then
they
passed
a
month
or
two
at
the
after
which
the
baby
had
been
born
and
then
there
came
another
winter
and
another
spring
nora
rowley
was
with
them
in
london
and
by
this
time
trevelyan
had
begun
to
think
that
he
should
like
to
have
his
own
way
completely
his
baby
was
very
nice
and
his
wife
was
clever
pretty
and
attractive
nora
was
all
that
an
unmarried
sister
should
be
but
but
there
had
come
to
be
trouble
and
bitter
words
lady
rowley
had
been
right
when
she
said
that
her
daughter
emily
also
liked
to
have
her
own
way
if
i
am
suspected
said
trevelyan
to
her
sister
one
morning
as
they
sat
together
in
the
little
back
life
will
not
be
worth
having
how
can
you
talk
of
being
suspected
emily
what
does
he
mean
then
by
saying
that
he
would
rather
not
have
colonel
osborne
here
a
man
older
than
my
own
father
who
has
known
me
since
i
was
a
baby
he
did
mean
anything
of
that
kind
emily
you
know
he
did
not
and
you
should
not
say
so
it
would
be
too
horrible
to
think
of
it
was
a
great
deal
too
horrible
to
be
spoken
i
know
if
he
does
not
beg
my
pardon
i
shall
i
shall
continue
to
live
with
him
of
course
as
a
sort
of
upper
servant
because
of
baby
but
he
shall
know
what
i
think
and
feel
if
i
were
you
i
would
forget
it
how
can
i
forget
it
nothing
that
i
can
do
pleases
him
he
is
civil
and
kind
to
you
because
he
is
not
your
master
but
you
do
know
what
things
he
says
to
me
am
i
to
tell
colonel
osborne
not
to
come
heavens
and
earth
how
should
i
ever
hold
up
my
head
again
if
i
were
driven
to
do
that
he
will
be
here
i
have
no
doubt
and
louis
will
sit
there
below
in
the
library
and
hear
his
step
and
will
not
come
up
tell
richard
to
say
you
are
not
at
home
yes
and
everybody
will
understand
why
and
for
what
am
i
to
deny
myself
in
that
way
to
the
best
and
oldest
friend
i
have
if
any
such
orders
are
to
be
given
let
him
give
them
and
then
see
what
will
come
of
it
trevelyan
had
described
colonel
osborne
truly
as
far
as
words
went
in
saying
that
he
had
known
her
since
she
was
a
baby
and
that
he
was
an
older
man
than
her
father
colonel
osborne
age
exceeded
her
father
by
about
a
month
and
as
he
was
now
past
fifty
he
might
be
considered
perhaps
in
that
respect
to
be
a
safe
friend
for
a
young
married
woman
but
he
was
in
every
respect
a
man
very
different
from
sir
marmaduke
sir
marmaduke
blessed
and
at
the
same
time
burdened
as
he
was
with
a
wife
and
eight
daughters
and
condemned
as
he
had
been
to
pass
a
large
portion
of
his
life
within
the
tropics
had
become
at
fifty
what
many
people
call
quite
a
man
that
is
to
say
he
was
one
from
whom
the
effervescence
and
elasticity
and
salt
of
youth
had
altogether
passed
away
he
was
fat
and
slow
thinking
much
of
his
wife
and
eight
daughters
thinking
much
also
of
his
dinner
now
colonel
osborne
was
a
bachelor
with
no
burdens
but
those
imposed
upon
him
by
his
position
as
a
member
of
parliament
a
man
of
fortune
to
whom
the
world
had
been
very
easy
it
was
not
therefore
said
so
decidedly
of
him
as
of
sir
marmaduke
that
he
was
a
man
although
he
had
probably
already
lived
more
than
of
his
life
and
he
was
a
man
of
his
age
bald
indeed
at
the
top
of
his
head
and
with
a
considerable
sprinkling
of
grey
hair
through
his
bushy
beard
but
upright
in
his
carriage
active
and
quick
in
his
step
who
dressed
well
and
was
clearly
determined
to
make
the
most
he
could
of
what
remained
to
him
of
the
advantages
of
youth
colonel
osborne
was
always
so
dressed
that
no
one
ever
observed
the
nature
of
his
garments
being
no
doubt
well
aware
that
no
man
after
can
afford
to
call
special
attention
to
his
coat
his
hat
his
cravat
or
his
trousers
but
nevertheless
the
matter
was
one
to
which
he
paid
much
attention
and
he
was
by
no
means
lax
in
ascertaining
what
his
tailor
did
for
him
he
always
rode
a
pretty
horse
and
mounted
his
groom
on
one
at
any
rate
as
pretty
he
was
known
to
have
an
excellent
stud
down
in
the
shires
and
had
the
reputation
of
going
well
with
hounds
poor
sir
marmaduke
could
not
have
ridden
a
hunt
to
save
either
his
government
or
his
credit
when
therefore
trevelyan
declared
to
her
sister
that
colonel
osborne
was
a
man
whom
she
was
entitled
to
regard
with
feelings
of
veneration
because
he
was
older
than
her
father
she
made
a
comparison
which
was
more
true
in
the
letter
than
in
the
spirit
and
when
she
asserted
that
colonel
osborne
had
known
her
since
she
was
a
baby
she
fell
again
into
the
same
mistake
colonel
osborne
had
indeed
known
her
when
she
was
a
baby
and
had
in
old
days
been
the
very
intimate
friend
of
her
father
but
of
herself
he
had
seen
little
or
nothing
since
those
baby
days
till
he
had
met
her
just
as
she
was
about
to
become
trevelyan
and
though
it
was
natural
that
so
old
a
friend
should
come
to
her
and
congratulate
her
and
renew
his
friendship
nevertheless
it
was
not
true
that
he
made
his
appearance
in
her
husband
house
in
the
guise
of
the
useful
old
family
friend
who
gives
silver
cups
to
the
children
and
kisses
the
little
girls
for
the
sake
of
the
old
affection
which
he
has
borne
for
the
parents
we
all
know
the
appearance
of
that
old
gentleman
how
pleasant
and
dear
a
fellow
he
is
how
welcome
is
his
face
within
the
gate
how
free
he
makes
with
our
wine
generally
abusing
it
how
he
tells
our
eldest
daughter
to
light
his
candle
for
him
how
he
gave
silver
cups
when
the
girls
were
born
and
now
bestows
as
they
get
married
a
most
useful
safe
and
charming
fellow
not
a
year
or
more
nimble
than
ourselves
without
whom
life
would
be
very
blank
we
all
know
that
man
but
such
a
man
was
not
colonel
osborne
in
the
house
of
trevelyan
young
bride
emily
rowley
when
she
was
brought
home
from
the
mandarin
islands
to
be
the
wife
of
louis
trevelyan
was
a
very
handsome
young
woman
tall
with
a
bust
rather
full
for
her
age
with
dark
eyes
eyes
that
looked
to
be
dark
because
her
and
were
nearly
black
but
which
were
in
truth
so
varying
in
colour
that
you
could
not
tell
their
hue
her
brown
hair
was
very
dark
and
very
soft
and
the
tint
of
her
complexion
was
brown
also
though
the
colour
of
her
cheeks
was
often
so
bright
as
to
induce
her
enemies
to
say
falsely
of
her
that
she
painted
them
and
she
was
very
strong
as
are
some
girls
who
come
from
the
tropics
and
whom
a
tropical
climate
has
suited
she
could
sit
on
her
horse
the
whole
day
long
and
would
never
be
weary
with
dancing
at
the
government
house
balls
when
colonel
osborne
was
introduced
to
her
as
the
baby
whom
he
had
known
he
thought
it
would
be
very
pleasant
to
be
intimate
with
so
pleasant
a
friend
meaning
no
harm
indeed
as
but
few
men
do
mean
harm
on
such
occasions
but
still
not
regarding
the
beautiful
young
woman
whom
he
had
seen
as
one
of
a
generation
succeeding
to
that
of
his
own
to
whom
it
would
be
his
duty
to
make
himself
useful
on
account
of
the
old
friendship
which
he
bore
to
her
father
it
was
moreover
well
known
in
london
though
not
known
at
all
to
trevelyan
that
this
ancient
lothario
had
before
this
made
himself
troublesome
in
more
than
one
family
he
was
fond
of
intimacies
with
married
ladies
and
perhaps
was
not
averse
to
the
excitement
of
marital
hostility
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
the
hostility
to
which
allusion
is
here
made
was
not
the
hostility
of
the
pistol
or
the
horsewhip
nor
indeed
was
it
generally
the
hostility
of
a
word
of
spoken
anger
a
young
husband
may
dislike
the
bearing
of
a
friend
and
may
yet
abstain
from
that
outrage
on
his
own
dignity
and
on
his
wife
which
is
conveyed
by
a
word
of
suspicion
louis
trevelyan
having
taken
a
strong
dislike
to
colonel
osborne
and
having
failed
to
make
his
wife
understand
that
this
dislike
should
have
induced
her
to
throw
cold
water
upon
the
colonel
friendship
had
allowed
himself
to
speak
a
word
which
probably
he
would
have
willingly
recalled
as
soon
as
spoken
but
words
spoken
can
not
be
recalled
and
many
a
man
and
many
a
woman
who
has
spoken
a
word
at
once
regretted
are
far
too
proud
to
express
that
regret
so
it
was
with
louis
trevelyan
when
he
told
his
wife
that
he
did
not
wish
colonel
osborne
to
come
so
often
to
his
house
he
had
said
it
with
a
flashing
eye
and
an
angry
tone
and
though
she
had
seen
the
eye
flash
before
and
was
familiar
with
the
angry
tone
she
had
never
before
felt
herself
to
be
insulted
by
her
husband
as
soon
as
the
word
had
been
spoken
trevelyan
had
left
the
room
and
had
gone
down
among
his
books
but
when
he
was
alone
he
knew
that
he
had
insulted
his
wife
he
was
quite
aware
that
he
should
have
spoken
to
her
gently
and
have
explained
to
her
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
that
it
would
be
better
for
both
of
them
that
this
friendship
should
be
limited
there
is
so
much
in
a
turn
of
the
eye
and
in
the
tone
given
to
a
word
when
such
things
have
to
be
said
so
much
more
of
importance
than
in
the
words
themselves
as
trevelyan
thought
of
this
and
remembered
what
his
manner
had
been
how
much
anger
he
had
expressed
how
far
he
had
been
from
having
his
arm
round
his
wife
waist
as
he
spoke
to
her
he
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
to
apologise
but
he
was
one
to
whose
nature
the
giving
of
any
apology
was
repulsive
he
could
not
bear
to
have
to
own
himself
to
have
been
wrong
and
then
his
wife
had
been
most
provoking
in
her
manner
to
him
when
he
had
endeavoured
to
make
her
understand
his
wishes
by
certain
disparaging
hints
which
he
had
thrown
out
as
to
colonel
osborne
saying
that
he
was
a
dangerous
man
one
who
did
not
show
his
true
character
a
snake
in
the
grass
a
man
without
settled
principles
and
such
like
his
wife
had
taken
up
the
cudgels
for
her
friend
and
had
openly
declared
that
she
did
not
believe
a
word
of
the
things
that
were
alleged
against
him
but
still
for
all
that
it
is
true
the
husband
had
said
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
think
so
the
wife
had
replied
men
do
believe
evil
of
one
another
very
often
but
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
i
think
you
are
mistaken
i
have
known
colonel
osborne
much
longer
than
you
have
done
louis
and
papa
has
always
had
the
highest
opinion
of
him
then
trevelyan
had
become
very
angry
and
had
spoken
those
words
which
he
could
not
recall
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
among
his
books
he
almost
felt
that
he
ought
to
beg
his
wife
pardon
he
knew
his
wife
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
she
would
not
forgive
him
unless
he
did
so
he
would
do
so
he
thought
but
not
exactly
now
a
moment
would
come
in
which
it
might
be
easier
than
at
present
he
would
be
able
to
assure
her
when
he
went
up
to
dress
for
dinner
that
he
had
meant
no
harm
they
were
going
out
to
dine
at
the
house
of
a
lady
of
rank
the
countess
dowager
of
milborough
a
lady
standing
high
in
the
world
esteem
of
whom
his
wife
stood
a
little
in
awe
and
he
calculated
that
this
feeling
if
it
did
not
make
his
task
easy
would
yet
take
from
it
some
of
its
difficulty
emily
would
be
not
exactly
cowed
by
the
prospect
of
lady
milborough
dinner
but
perhaps
a
little
reduced
from
her
usual
he
would
say
a
word
to
her
when
he
was
dressing
assuring
her
that
he
had
not
intended
to
animadvert
in
the
slightest
degree
upon
her
own
conduct
illustration
shewing
how
wrath
began
luncheon
was
served
and
the
two
ladies
went
down
into
the
trevelyan
did
not
appear
there
was
nothing
in
itself
singular
in
that
as
he
was
accustomed
to
declare
that
luncheon
was
a
meal
too
much
in
the
day
and
that
a
man
should
eat
nothing
beyond
a
biscuit
between
breakfast
and
dinner
but
he
would
sometimes
come
in
and
eat
his
biscuit
standing
on
the
and
drink
what
he
would
call
half
a
quarter
of
a
glass
of
sherry
it
would
probably
have
been
well
that
he
should
have
done
so
now
but
he
remained
in
his
library
behind
the
and
when
his
wife
and
his
had
gone
he
became
anxious
to
learn
whether
colonel
osborne
would
come
on
that
day
and
if
so
whether
he
would
be
admitted
he
had
been
told
that
nora
rowley
was
to
be
called
for
by
another
lady
a
fairfax
to
go
out
and
look
at
pictures
his
wife
had
declined
to
join
fairfax
party
having
declared
that
as
she
was
going
to
dine
out
she
would
not
leave
her
baby
all
the
afternoon
louis
trevelyan
though
he
strove
to
apply
his
mind
to
an
article
which
he
was
writing
for
a
scientific
quarterly
review
could
not
keep
himself
from
anxiety
as
to
this
expected
visit
from
colonel
osborne
he
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
he
swore
to
himself
fifty
times
over
that
any
such
feeling
on
his
part
would
be
a
monstrous
injury
to
his
wife
nevertheless
he
knew
that
he
would
be
gratified
if
on
that
special
day
colonel
osborne
should
be
informed
that
his
wife
was
not
at
home
whether
the
man
were
admitted
or
not
he
would
beg
his
wife
pardon
but
he
could
he
thought
do
so
with
more
thorough
efficacy
and
affection
if
she
should
have
shown
a
disposition
to
comply
with
his
wishes
on
this
day
do
say
a
word
to
richard
said
nora
to
her
sister
in
a
whisper
as
they
were
going
after
luncheon
i
will
not
said
trevelyan
may
i
do
it
certainly
not
nora
i
should
feel
that
i
were
demeaning
myself
were
i
to
allow
what
was
said
to
me
in
such
a
manner
to
have
any
effect
upon
me
i
think
you
are
so
wrong
emily
i
do
indeed
you
must
allow
me
to
be
the
best
judge
what
to
do
in
my
own
house
and
with
my
own
husband
oh
yes
certainly
if
he
gives
me
any
command
i
will
obey
it
or
if
he
had
expressed
his
wish
in
any
other
words
i
would
have
complied
but
to
be
told
that
he
would
rather
not
have
colonel
osborne
here
if
you
had
seen
his
manner
and
heard
his
words
you
would
not
have
been
surprised
that
i
should
feel
it
as
i
do
it
was
a
gross
insult
and
it
was
not
the
first
as
she
spoke
the
fire
flashed
from
her
eye
and
the
bright
red
colour
of
her
cheek
told
a
tale
of
her
anger
which
her
sister
well
knew
how
to
read
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
they
both
knew
that
colonel
osborne
was
there
louis
trevelyan
sitting
in
his
library
also
knew
of
whose
coming
that
knock
gave
notice
chapter
ii
colonel
osborne
it
has
been
already
said
that
colonel
osborne
was
a
bachelor
a
man
of
fortune
a
member
of
parliament
and
one
who
carried
his
half
century
of
years
lightly
on
his
shoulders
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
say
further
of
him
that
he
was
a
man
popular
with
those
among
whom
he
lived
as
a
politician
as
a
sportsman
and
as
a
member
of
society
he
could
speak
well
in
the
house
though
he
spoke
but
seldom
and
it
was
generally
thought
of
him
that
he
might
have
been
something
considerable
had
it
not
suited
him
better
to
be
nothing
at
all
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
conservative
and
generally
voted
with
the
conservative
party
but
he
could
boast
that
he
was
altogether
independent
and
on
an
occasion
would
take
the
trouble
of
proving
himself
to
be
so
he
was
in
possession
of
excellent
health
had
all
that
the
world
could
give
was
fond
of
books
pictures
architecture
and
china
had
various
tastes
and
the
means
of
indulging
them
and
was
one
of
those
few
men
on
whom
it
seems
that
every
pleasant
thing
has
been
lavished
there
was
that
little
slur
on
his
good
name
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
but
those
who
knew
colonel
osborne
best
were
generally
willing
to
declare
that
no
harm
was
intended
and
that
the
evils
which
arose
were
always
to
be
attributed
to
mistaken
jealousy
he
had
his
friends
said
a
free
and
pleasant
way
with
women
which
women
like
a
pleasant
way
of
free
friendship
that
there
was
no
more
and
that
the
harm
which
had
come
had
always
come
from
false
suspicion
but
there
were
certain
ladies
about
the
town
good
motherly
discreet
women
who
hated
the
name
of
colonel
osborne
who
would
not
admit
him
within
their
doors
who
would
not
bow
to
him
in
other
people
houses
who
would
always
speak
of
him
as
a
serpent
a
hyena
a
kite
or
a
shark
old
lady
milborough
was
one
of
these
a
daughter
of
a
friend
of
hers
having
once
admitted
the
serpent
to
her
intimacy
augustus
poole
was
wise
enough
to
take
his
wife
abroad
said
old
lady
milborough
discussing
about
this
time
with
a
gossip
of
hers
the
danger
of
trevelyan
position
or
there
would
have
been
a
there
and
yet
there
never
was
a
better
girl
in
the
world
than
jane
marriott
the
reader
may
be
quite
certain
that
colonel
osborne
had
no
premeditated
evil
intention
when
he
allowed
himself
to
become
the
intimate
friend
of
his
old
friend
daughter
there
was
nothing
fiendish
in
his
nature
he
was
not
a
man
who
boasted
of
his
conquests
he
was
not
a
ravening
wolf
going
about
seeking
whom
he
might
devour
and
determined
to
devour
whatever
might
come
in
his
way
but
he
liked
that
which
was
pleasant
and
of
all
pleasant
things
the
company
of
a
pretty
clever
woman
was
to
him
the
pleasantest
at
this
exact
period
of
his
life
no
woman
was
so
pleasantly
pretty
to
him
and
so
agreeably
clever
as
trevelyan
when
louis
trevelyan
heard
on
the
stairs
the
step
of
the
dangerous
man
he
got
up
from
his
chair
as
though
he
too
would
have
gone
into
the
and
it
would
perhaps
have
been
well
had
he
done
so
could
he
have
done
this
and
kept
his
temper
with
the
man
he
would
have
paved
the
way
for
an
easy
reconciliation
with
his
wife
but
when
he
reached
the
door
of
his
room
and
had
placed
his
hand
upon
the
lock
he
withdrew
again
he
told
himself
he
withdrew
because
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
jealous
but
in
truth
he
did
so
because
he
knew
he
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
be
civil
to
the
man
he
hated
so
he
sat
down
and
took
up
his
pen
and
began
to
cudgel
his
brain
about
the
scientific
article
he
was
intent
on
raising
a
dispute
with
some
learned
pundit
about
the
waves
of
sound
but
he
could
think
of
no
other
sound
than
that
of
the
light
steps
of
colonel
osborne
as
he
had
gone
he
put
down
his
pen
and
clenched
his
fist
and
allowed
a
black
frown
to
settle
upon
his
brow
what
right
had
the
man
to
come
there
unasked
by
him
and
disturb
his
happiness
and
then
this
poor
wife
of
his
who
knew
so
little
of
english
life
who
had
lived
in
the
mandarin
islands
almost
since
she
had
been
a
child
who
had
lived
in
one
colony
or
another
almost
since
she
had
been
born
who
had
had
so
few
of
those
advantages
for
which
he
should
have
looked
in
marrying
a
wife
how
was
the
poor
girl
to
conduct
herself
properly
when
subjected
to
the
arts
and
practised
villanies
of
this
viper
and
yet
the
poor
girl
was
so
stiff
in
her
temper
had
picked
up
such
a
trick
of
obstinacy
in
those
tropical
regions
that
louis
trevelyan
felt
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
manage
her
he
too
had
heard
how
jane
marriott
had
been
carried
off
to
naples
after
she
had
become
poole
must
he
too
carry
off
his
wife
to
naples
in
order
to
place
her
out
of
the
reach
of
this
hyena
it
was
terrible
to
him
to
think
that
he
must
pack
up
everything
and
run
away
from
such
a
one
as
colonel
osborne
and
even
were
he
to
consent
to
do
this
how
could
he
explain
it
all
to
that
very
wife
for
whose
sake
he
would
do
it
if
she
got
a
hint
of
the
reason
she
would
he
did
not
doubt
refuse
to
go
as
he
thought
of
it
and
as
that
visit
prolonged
itself
he
almost
thought
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
be
round
with
her
we
all
know
what
a
husband
means
when
he
resolves
to
be
round
with
his
wife
he
began
to
think
that
he
would
not
apologise
at
all
for
the
words
he
had
spoken
but
would
speak
them
again
somewhat
more
sharply
than
before
she
would
be
very
wrathful
with
him
there
would
be
a
silent
enduring
indignation
which
as
he
understood
well
would
be
infinitely
worse
than
any
torrent
of
words
but
was
he
a
man
to
abstain
from
doing
that
which
he
believed
to
be
his
duty
because
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife
anger
should
he
be
deterred
from
saying
that
which
he
conceived
it
would
be
right
that
he
should
say
because
she
was
no
he
would
not
apologise
but
would
tell
her
again
that
it
was
necessary
both
for
his
happiness
and
for
hers
that
all
intimacy
with
colonel
osborne
should
be
discontinued
he
was
brought
to
this
strongly
marital
resolution
by
the
length
of
the
man
present
visit
by
that
and
by
the
fact
that
during
the
latter
portion
of
it
his
wife
was
alone
with
colonel
osborne
nora
had
been
there
when
the
man
came
but
fairfax
had
called
not
getting
out
of
her
carriage
and
nora
had
been
constrained
to
go
down
to
her
she
had
hesitated
a
moment
and
colonel
osborne
had
observed
and
partly
understood
the
hesitation
when
he
saw
it
had
he
been
perfectly
in
the
matter
he
would
have
gone
too
but
he
probably
told
himself
that
nora
rowley
was
a
fool
and
that
in
such
matters
it
was
quite
enough
for
a
man
to
know
that
he
did
not
intend
any
harm
you
had
better
go
down
nora
said
trevelyan
fairfax
will
be
ever
so
angry
if
you
keep
her
waiting
then
nora
had
gone
and
the
two
were
alone
together
nora
had
gone
and
trevelyan
had
heard
her
as
she
was
going
and
knew
that
colonel
osborne
was
alone
with
his
wife
if
you
can
manage
that
it
will
be
so
nice
said
trevelyan
continuing
the
conversation
my
dear
emily
he
said
you
must
not
talk
of
my
managing
it
or
you
will
spoil
it
all
he
had
called
them
both
emily
and
nora
when
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
were
with
them
before
the
marriage
and
taking
the
liberty
of
a
very
old
family
friend
had
continued
the
practice
trevelyan
was
quite
aware
that
she
had
been
so
called
by
him
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
and
that
her
husband
had
not
objected
but
that
was
now
some
months
ago
before
baby
was
born
and
she
was
aware
also
that
he
had
not
called
her
so
latterly
in
presence
of
her
husband
she
thoroughly
wished
that
she
knew
how
to
ask
him
not
to
do
so
again
but
the
matter
was
very
difficult
as
she
could
not
make
such
a
request
without
betraying
some
fear
on
her
husband
part
the
subject
which
they
were
now
discussing
was
too
important
to
her
to
allow
her
to
dwell
upon
this
trouble
at
the
moment
and
so
she
permitted
him
to
go
on
with
his
speech
if
i
were
to
manage
it
as
you
call
it
which
i
ca
do
at
all
it
would
be
a
gross
job
that
all
nonsense
to
us
colonel
osborne
ladies
always
like
political
jobs
and
think
that
they
and
they
only
make
politics
bearable
but
this
would
not
be
a
job
at
all
papa
could
do
it
better
than
anybody
else
think
how
long
he
has
been
at
it
the
matter
in
discussion
was
the
chance
of
an
order
being
sent
out
to
sir
marmaduke
to
come
home
from
his
islands
at
the
public
expense
to
give
evidence
respecting
colonial
government
in
general
to
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
which
was
about
to
sit
on
the
subject
the
committee
had
been
voted
and
two
governors
were
to
be
brought
home
for
the
purpose
of
giving
evidence
what
arrangement
could
be
so
pleasant
to
a
governor
living
in
the
mandarin
islands
who
had
had
a
holiday
lately
and
who
could
but
ill
afford
to
take
any
holidays
at
his
own
expense
colonel
osborne
was
on
this
committee
and
moreover
was
on
good
terms
at
the
colonial
office
there
were
men
in
office
who
would
be
glad
to
do
colonel
osborne
a
service
and
then
if
this
were
a
job
it
would
be
so
very
little
of
a
job
perhaps
sir
marmaduke
might
not
be
the
very
best
man
for
the
purpose
perhaps
the
government
of
the
mandarins
did
not
afford
the
best
specimen
of
that
colonial
lore
which
it
was
the
business
of
the
committee
to
master
but
then
two
governors
were
to
come
and
it
might
be
as
well
to
have
one
of
the
best
sort
and
one
of
the
second
best
no
one
supposed
that
excellent
old
sir
marmaduke
was
a
paragon
of
a
governor
but
then
he
had
an
infinity
of
experience
for
over
twenty
years
he
had
been
from
island
to
island
and
had
at
least
steered
clear
of
great
scrapes
we
try
it
at
any
rate
said
the
colonel
do
colonel
osborne
mamma
would
come
with
him
of
course
we
should
leave
him
to
manage
all
that
it
not
very
likely
that
he
would
leave
lady
rowley
behind
he
never
has
i
know
he
thinks
more
of
mamma
than
he
ever
does
of
himself
fancy
having
them
here
in
the
autumn
i
suppose
if
he
came
for
the
end
of
the
session
they
would
send
him
back
quite
at
once
i
rather
fancy
that
our
foreign
and
colonial
servants
know
how
to
stretch
a
point
when
they
find
themselves
in
england
of
course
they
do
colonel
osborne
and
why
should
they
think
of
all
that
they
have
to
endure
out
in
those
horrible
places
how
would
you
like
to
live
in
the
mandarins
i
should
prefer
london
certainly
of
course
you
would
and
you
must
begrudge
papa
a
month
or
two
when
he
comes
i
never
cared
about
your
being
in
parliament
before
but
i
shall
think
so
much
of
you
now
if
you
can
manage
to
get
papa
home
there
could
be
nothing
more
innocent
than
this
nothing
more
innocent
at
any
rate
as
regarded
any
offence
against
trevelyan
but
just
then
there
came
a
word
which
a
little
startled
trevelyan
and
made
her
feel
afraid
that
she
was
doing
wrong
i
must
make
one
stipulation
with
you
emily
said
the
colonel
what
is
that
you
must
not
tell
your
husband
oh
dear
and
why
not
i
am
sure
you
are
sharp
enough
to
see
why
you
should
not
a
word
of
this
repeated
at
any
club
would
put
an
end
at
once
to
your
project
and
would
be
very
damaging
to
me
and
beyond
that
i
would
wish
him
to
know
that
i
had
meddled
with
it
at
all
i
am
very
chary
of
having
my
name
connected
with
anything
of
the
kind
and
upon
my
word
i
would
do
it
for
any
living
human
being
but
yourself
you
promise
me
emily
she
gave
the
promise
but
there
were
two
things
in
the
matter
as
it
stood
at
present
which
she
did
not
at
all
like
she
was
very
averse
to
having
any
secret
from
her
husband
with
colonel
osborne
and
she
was
not
at
all
pleased
at
being
told
that
he
was
doing
for
her
a
favour
that
he
would
not
have
done
for
any
other
living
human
being
had
he
said
so
to
her
yesterday
before
those
offensive
words
had
been
spoken
by
her
husband
she
would
not
have
thought
much
about
it
she
would
have
connected
the
man
friendship
for
herself
with
his
very
old
friendship
for
her
father
and
she
would
have
regarded
the
assurance
as
made
to
the
rowleys
in
general
and
not
to
herself
in
particular
but
now
after
what
had
occurred
it
pained
her
to
be
told
by
colonel
osborne
that
he
would
make
specially
on
her
behalf
a
sacrifice
of
his
political
pride
which
he
would
make
for
no
other
person
living
and
then
as
he
had
called
her
by
her
christian
name
as
he
had
exacted
the
promise
there
had
been
a
tone
of
affection
in
his
voice
that
she
had
almost
felt
to
be
too
warm
but
she
gave
the
promise
and
when
he
pressed
her
hand
at
parting
she
pressed
his
again
in
token
of
gratitude
for
the
kindness
to
be
done
to
her
father
and
mother
immediately
afterwards
colonel
osborne
went
away
and
trevelyan
was
left
alone
in
her
she
knew
that
her
husband
was
still
and
listened
for
a
moment
to
hear
whether
he
would
now
come
up
to
her
and
he
too
had
heard
the
colonel
step
as
he
went
and
for
a
few
moments
had
doubted
whether
or
no
he
would
at
once
go
to
his
wife
though
he
believed
himself
to
be
a
man
very
firm
of
purpose
his
mind
had
oscillated
backwards
and
forwards
within
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
between
those
two
purposes
of
being
round
with
his
wife
and
of
begging
her
pardon
for
the
words
which
he
had
already
spoken
he
believed
that
he
would
best
do
his
duty
by
that
plan
of
being
round
with
her
but
then
it
would
be
so
much
pleasanter
at
any
rate
so
much
easier
to
beg
her
pardon
but
of
one
thing
he
was
quite
certain
he
must
by
some
means
exclude
colonel
osborne
from
his
house
he
could
not
live
and
continue
to
endure
the
feelings
which
he
had
suffered
while
sitting
at
his
desk
with
the
knowledge
that
colonel
osborne
was
closeted
with
his
wife
it
might
be
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
that
his
wife
was
innocent
he
was
quite
sure
but
nevertheless
he
was
himself
so
much
affected
by
some
feeling
which
pervaded
him
in
reference
to
this
man
that
all
his
energy
was
destroyed
and
his
powers
of
mind
and
body
were
paralysed
he
could
not
and
would
not
stand
it
rather
than
that
he
would
follow
poole
and
take
his
wife
to
naples
so
resolving
he
put
his
hat
on
his
head
and
walked
out
of
the
house
he
would
have
the
advantage
of
the
afternoon
consideration
before
he
took
either
the
one
step
or
the
other
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
emily
trevelyan
went
to
her
baby
she
would
not
stir
as
long
as
there
had
been
a
chance
of
his
coming
to
her
she
very
much
wished
that
he
would
come
and
had
made
up
her
mind
in
spite
of
the
fierceness
of
her
assertion
to
her
sister
to
accept
any
slightest
hint
at
an
apology
which
her
husband
might
offer
to
her
to
this
state
of
mind
she
was
brought
by
the
consciousness
of
having
a
secret
from
him
and
by
a
sense
not
of
impropriety
on
her
own
part
but
of
conduct
which
some
people
might
have
called
improper
in
her
mode
of
parting
from
the
man
against
whom
her
husband
had
warned
her
the
warmth
of
that
and
the
affectionate
tone
in
which
her
name
had
been
pronounced
and
the
promise
made
to
her
softened
her
heart
towards
her
husband
had
he
gone
to
her
now
and
said
a
word
to
her
in
gentleness
all
might
have
been
made
right
but
he
did
not
go
to
her
if
he
chooses
to
be
cross
and
sulky
he
may
be
cross
and
sulky
said
trevelyan
to
herself
as
she
went
up
to
her
baby
has
louis
been
with
you
nora
asked
as
soon
as
fairfax
had
brought
her
home
i
have
not
seen
him
since
you
left
me
said
trevelyan
i
suppose
he
went
out
before
colonel
osborne
no
indeed
he
waited
till
colonel
osborne
had
gone
and
then
he
went
himself
but
he
did
not
come
near
me
it
is
for
him
to
judge
of
his
own
conduct
but
i
must
say
that
i
think
he
is
very
foolish
this
the
young
wife
said
in
a
tone
which
clearly
indicated
that
she
had
judged
her
husband
conduct
and
had
found
it
to
be
very
foolish
indeed
do
you
think
that
papa
and
mamma
will
really
come
said
nora
changing
the
subject
of
conversation
how
can
i
tell
how
am
i
to
know
after
all
that
has
passed
i
am
afraid
to
say
a
word
lest
i
should
be
accused
of
doing
wrong
but
remember
this
nora
you
are
not
to
speak
of
it
to
any
one
you
will
tell
louis
no
i
will
tell
no
one
dear
dear
emily
pray
do
not
keep
anything
secret
from
him
what
do
you
mean
by
secret
there
is
any
secret
only
in
such
matters
as
that
about
politics
no
gentleman
likes
to
have
his
name
talked
about
a
look
of
great
distress
came
upon
nora
face
as
she
heard
this
to
her
it
seemed
to
be
very
bad
that
there
should
be
a
secret
between
her
sister
and
colonel
osborne
to
be
kept
from
her
i
suppose
you
will
suspect
me
next
said
trevelyan
angrily
emily
how
can
you
say
anything
so
cruel
you
look
as
if
you
did
i
only
mean
that
i
think
it
would
be
wiser
to
tell
all
this
to
louis
how
can
i
tell
him
colonel
osborne
private
business
when
colonel
osborne
has
desired
me
not
to
do
so
for
whose
sake
is
colonel
osborne
doing
this
for
papa
and
mamma
i
suppose
louis
be
jealous
because
i
want
to
have
papa
and
mamma
home
it
would
not
be
a
bit
less
unreasonable
than
the
other
chapter
iii
lady
milborough
dinner
party
louis
trevelyan
went
down
to
his
club
in
pall
mall
the
acrobats
and
there
heard
a
rumour
that
added
to
his
anger
against
colonel
osborne
the
acrobats
was
a
very
distinguished
club
into
which
it
was
now
difficult
for
a
young
man
to
find
his
way
and
almost
impossible
for
a
man
who
was
no
longer
young
and
therefore
known
to
many
it
had
been
founded
some
twenty
years
since
with
the
idea
of
promoting
muscular
exercise
and
gymnastic
amusements
but
the
promoters
had
become
fat
and
lethargic
and
the
acrobats
spent
their
time
mostly
in
playing
whist
and
in
ordering
and
eating
their
dinners
there
were
supposed
to
be
in
some
part
of
the
building
certain
poles
and
sticks
and
parallel
bars
with
which
feats
of
activity
might
be
practised
but
no
one
ever
asked
for
them
and
a
man
when
he
became
an
acrobat
did
so
with
a
view
either
to
the
whist
or
the
cook
or
possibly
to
the
social
excellences
of
the
club
louis
trevelyan
was
an
acrobat
as
was
also
colonel
osborne
so
old
rowley
is
coming
home
said
one
distinguished
acrobat
to
another
in
trevelyan
hearing
how
the
deuce
is
he
managing
that
he
was
here
a
year
ago
osborne
is
getting
it
done
he
is
to
come
as
a
witness
for
this
committee
it
must
be
no
end
of
a
lounge
for
him
it
does
count
as
leave
and
he
has
every
shilling
paid
for
him
down
to
his
when
he
goes
out
to
dinner
there
nothing
like
having
a
friend
at
court
such
was
the
secrecy
of
colonel
osborne
secret
he
had
been
so
chary
of
having
his
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
a
political
job
that
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
impose
on
his
young
friend
the
burden
of
a
secret
from
her
husband
and
yet
the
husband
heard
the
whole
story
told
openly
at
his
club
on
the
same
day
there
was
nothing
in
the
story
to
anger
trevelyan
had
he
not
immediately
felt
that
there
must
be
some
plan
in
the
matter
between
his
wife
and
colonel
osborne
of
which
he
had
been
kept
ignorant
hitherto
indeed
his
wife
as
the
reader
knows
could
not
have
told
him
he
had
not
seen
her
since
the
matter
had
been
discussed
between
her
and
her
friend
but
he
was
angry
because
he
first
learned
at
his
club
that
which
he
thought
he
ought
to
have
learned
at
home
as
soon
as
he
reached
his
house
he
went
at
once
to
his
wife
room
but
her
maid
was
with
her
and
nothing
could
be
said
at
that
moment
he
then
dressed
himself
intending
to
go
to
emily
as
soon
as
the
girl
had
left
her
but
the
girl
remained
was
as
he
believed
kept
in
the
room
purposely
by
his
wife
so
that
he
should
have
no
moment
of
private
conversation
he
went
therefore
and
found
nora
standing
by
the
fire
so
you
are
dressed
first
he
said
i
thought
your
turn
always
came
last
emily
sent
jenny
to
me
first
because
she
thought
you
would
be
home
and
she
did
go
up
to
dress
till
the
last
minute
this
was
intended
well
by
nora
but
it
did
not
have
the
desired
effect
trevelyan
who
had
no
command
over
his
own
features
frowned
and
showed
that
he
was
displeased
he
hesitated
a
moment
thinking
whether
he
would
ask
nora
any
question
as
to
this
report
about
her
father
and
mother
but
before
he
had
spoken
his
wife
was
in
the
room
we
are
all
late
i
fear
said
emily
you
at
any
rate
are
the
last
said
her
husband
about
half
a
minute
said
the
wife
then
they
got
into
the
hired
brougham
which
was
standing
at
the
door
trevelyan
in
the
sweet
days
of
his
early
confidence
with
his
wife
had
offered
to
keep
a
carriage
for
her
explaining
to
her
that
the
luxury
though
costly
would
not
be
beyond
his
reach
but
she
had
persuaded
him
against
the
carriage
and
there
had
come
to
be
an
agreement
that
instead
of
the
carriage
there
should
always
be
an
autumn
tour
one
learns
something
from
going
about
but
one
learns
nothing
from
keeping
a
carriage
emily
had
said
those
had
been
happy
days
in
which
it
had
been
intended
that
everything
should
always
be
now
he
was
meditating
whether
in
lieu
of
that
autumn
tour
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
take
his
wife
away
to
naples
altogether
so
that
she
might
be
removed
from
the
influence
of
of
of
no
not
even
to
himself
would
he
think
of
colonel
osborne
as
his
wife
lover
the
idea
was
too
horrible
and
yet
how
dreadful
was
it
that
he
should
have
for
any
reason
to
withdraw
her
from
the
influence
of
any
man
lady
milborough
lived
ever
so
far
away
in
eccleston
square
but
trevelyan
did
not
say
a
single
word
to
either
of
his
companions
during
the
journey
he
was
cross
and
vexed
and
was
conscious
that
they
knew
that
he
was
cross
and
vexed
trevelyan
and
her
sister
talked
to
each
other
the
whole
way
but
they
did
so
in
that
tone
which
clearly
indicates
that
the
conversation
is
made
up
not
for
any
interest
attached
to
the
questions
asked
or
the
answers
given
but
because
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
not
be
silence
nora
said
something
about
marshall
and
snellgrove
and
tried
to
make
believe
that
she
was
very
anxious
for
her
sister
answer
and
emily
said
something
about
the
opera
at
covent
garden
which
was
intended
to
show
that
her
mind
was
quite
at
ease
but
both
of
them
failed
altogether
and
knew
that
they
failed
once
or
twice
trevelyan
thought
that
he
would
say
a
word
in
token
as
it
were
of
repentance
like
the
naughty
child
who
knew
that
he
was
naughty
he
was
trying
to
be
good
but
he
could
not
do
it
the
fiend
was
too
strong
within
him
she
must
have
known
that
there
was
a
proposition
for
her
return
through
colonel
osborne
influence
as
that
man
at
the
club
had
heard
it
how
could
she
not
have
known
it
when
they
got
out
at
lady
milborough
door
he
had
spoken
to
neither
of
them
there
was
a
large
dull
party
made
up
mostly
of
old
people
lady
milborough
and
trevelyan
mother
had
been
bosom
friends
and
lady
milborough
had
on
this
account
taken
upon
herself
to
be
much
interested
in
trevelyan
wife
but
louis
trevelyan
himself
in
discussing
lady
milborough
with
emily
had
rather
turned
his
old
friend
into
ridicule
and
emily
had
of
course
followed
her
husband
mode
of
thinking
lady
milborough
had
once
or
twice
given
her
some
advice
on
small
matters
telling
her
that
this
or
that
air
would
be
good
for
her
baby
and
explaining
that
a
mother
during
a
certain
interesting
portion
of
her
life
should
refresh
herself
with
a
certain
kind
of
malt
liquor
of
all
counsel
on
such
domestic
subjects
trevelyan
was
impatient
as
indeed
it
was
her
nature
to
be
in
all
matters
and
consequently
authorized
as
she
had
been
by
her
husband
manner
of
speaking
of
his
mother
friend
she
had
taken
a
habit
of
quizzing
lady
milborough
behind
her
back
and
almost
of
continuing
the
practice
before
the
old
lady
face
lady
milborough
who
was
the
most
affectionate
old
soul
alive
and
with
her
friends
to
a
fault
had
never
resented
this
but
had
come
to
fear
that
trevelyan
was
perhaps
a
little
flighty
she
had
never
as
yet
allowed
herself
to
say
anything
worse
of
her
young
friend
wife
than
that
and
she
would
always
add
that
that
kind
of
thing
would
cure
itself
as
the
nursery
became
full
it
must
be
understood
therefore
that
trevelyan
was
not
anticipating
much
pleasure
from
lady
milborough
party
and
that
she
had
accepted
the
invitation
as
a
matter
of
duty
there
was
present
among
the
guests
a
certain
honourable
charles
glascock
the
eldest
son
of
lord
peterborough
who
made
the
affair
more
interesting
to
nora
than
it
was
to
her
sister
it
had
been
whispered
into
nora
ears
by
more
than
one
person
and
among
others
by
lady
milborough
whose
own
daughters
were
all
married
that
she
might
if
she
thought
fit
become
the
honourable
charles
glascock
now
whether
she
might
think
fit
or
whether
she
might
not
the
presence
of
the
gentleman
under
such
circumstances
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
gave
an
interest
to
the
evening
and
as
lady
milborough
took
care
that
glascock
should
take
nora
down
to
dinner
the
interest
was
very
great
glascock
was
a
man
just
under
forty
in
parliament
heir
to
a
peerage
and
known
to
be
well
off
in
respect
to
income
lady
milborough
and
trevelyan
had
told
nora
rowley
that
should
encouragement
in
that
direction
come
in
her
way
she
ought
to
allow
herself
to
fall
in
love
with
glascock
a
certain
amount
of
encouragement
had
come
in
her
way
but
she
had
not
as
yet
allowed
herself
to
fall
in
love
with
glascock
it
seemed
to
her
that
glascock
was
quite
conscious
of
the
advantages
of
his
own
position
and
that
his
powers
of
talking
about
other
matters
than
those
with
which
he
was
immediately
connected
were
limited
she
did
believe
that
he
had
in
truth
paid
her
the
compliment
of
falling
in
love
with
her
and
this
is
a
compliment
to
which
few
girls
are
indifferent
nora
might
perhaps
have
tried
to
fall
in
love
with
glascock
had
she
not
been
forced
to
make
comparisons
between
him
and
another
this
other
one
had
not
fallen
in
love
with
her
as
she
well
knew
and
she
certainly
had
not
fallen
in
love
with
him
but
still
the
comparison
was
forced
upon
her
and
it
did
not
result
in
favour
of
glascock
on
the
present
occasion
glascock
as
he
sat
next
to
her
almost
proposed
to
her
you
have
never
seen
monkhams
he
said
monkhams
was
his
seat
a
very
grand
place
in
worcestershire
of
course
he
knew
very
well
that
she
had
never
seen
monkhams
how
should
she
have
seen
it
i
have
never
been
in
that
part
of
england
at
all
she
replied
i
should
so
like
to
show
you
monkhams
the
oaks
there
are
the
finest
in
the
kingdom
do
you
like
oaks
who
does
not
like
oaks
but
we
have
none
in
the
islands
and
nobody
has
ever
seen
so
few
as
i
have
i
show
you
monkhams
some
day
shall
i
indeed
i
hope
that
some
day
i
may
really
show
you
monkhams
now
when
an
unmarried
man
talks
to
a
young
lady
of
really
showing
her
the
house
in
which
it
will
be
his
destiny
to
live
he
can
hardly
mean
other
than
to
invite
her
to
live
there
with
him
it
must
at
least
be
his
purpose
to
signify
that
if
duly
encouraged
he
will
so
invite
her
but
nora
rowley
did
not
give
glascock
much
encouragement
on
this
occasion
i
afraid
it
is
not
likely
that
anything
will
ever
take
me
into
that
part
of
the
country
she
said
there
was
something
perhaps
in
her
tone
which
checked
glascock
so
that
he
did
not
then
press
the
invitation
when
the
ladies
were
in
the
lady
milborough
contrived
to
seat
herself
on
a
couch
intended
for
two
persons
only
close
to
trevelyan
emily
thinking
that
she
might
perhaps
hear
some
advice
about
guinness
stout
prepared
herself
to
be
saucy
but
the
matter
in
hand
was
graver
than
that
lady
milborough
mind
was
uneasy
about
colonel
osborne
my
dear
said
she
was
not
your
father
very
intimate
with
that
colonel
osborne
he
is
very
intimate
with
him
lady
milborough
ah
yes
i
thought
i
had
heard
so
that
makes
it
of
course
natural
that
you
should
know
him
we
have
known
him
all
our
lives
said
emily
forgetting
probably
that
out
of
the
years
and
some
months
which
she
had
hitherto
lived
there
had
been
a
consecutive
period
of
more
than
twenty
years
in
which
she
had
never
seen
this
man
whom
she
had
known
all
her
life
that
makes
a
difference
of
course
and
i
do
mean
to
say
anything
against
him
i
hope
not
lady
milborough
because
we
are
all
especially
fond
of
him
this
was
said
with
so
much
of
purpose
that
poor
dear
old
lady
milborough
was
stopped
in
her
good
work
she
knew
well
the
terrible
strait
to
which
augustus
poole
had
been
brought
with
his
wife
although
nobody
supposed
that
poole
wife
had
ever
entertained
a
wrong
thought
in
her
pretty
little
heart
nevertheless
he
had
been
compelled
to
break
up
his
establishment
and
take
his
wife
to
naples
because
this
horrid
colonel
would
make
himself
at
home
in
poole
in
knightsbridge
augustus
poole
with
courage
enough
to
take
any
man
by
the
beard
had
taking
by
the
beard
been
possible
had
found
it
impossible
to
dislodge
the
colonel
he
could
not
do
so
without
making
a
row
which
would
have
been
disgraceful
to
himself
and
injurious
to
his
wife
and
therefore
he
had
taken
poole
to
naples
lady
milborough
knew
the
whole
story
and
thought
that
she
foresaw
that
the
same
thing
was
about
to
happen
in
the
in
curzon
street
when
she
attempted
to
say
a
word
to
the
wife
she
found
herself
stopped
she
could
not
go
on
in
that
quarter
after
the
reception
with
which
the
beginning
of
her
word
had
been
met
but
perhaps
she
might
succeed
better
with
the
husband
after
all
her
friendship
was
with
the
trevelyan
side
and
not
with
the
rowleys
my
dear
louis
she
said
i
want
to
speak
a
word
to
you
come
here
and
then
she
led
him
into
a
distant
corner
trevelyan
watching
her
all
the
while
and
guessing
why
her
husband
was
thus
carried
away
i
just
want
to
give
you
a
little
hint
which
i
am
sure
i
believe
is
quite
unnecessary
continued
lady
milborough
then
she
paused
but
trevelyan
would
not
speak
she
looked
into
his
face
and
saw
that
it
was
black
but
the
man
was
the
only
child
of
her
dearest
friend
and
she
persevered
do
you
know
i
do
quite
like
that
colonel
osborne
coming
so
much
to
your
house
the
face
before
her
became
still
blacker
but
still
the
man
said
nothing
i
dare
say
it
is
a
prejudice
on
my
part
but
i
have
always
disliked
him
i
think
he
is
a
dangerous
friend
what
i
call
a
snake
in
the
grass
and
though
emily
high
good
sense
and
love
for
you
and
general
feelings
on
such
a
subject
are
just
what
a
husband
must
desire
indeed
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
possibility
of
anything
wrong
has
never
entered
into
her
head
but
it
is
the
very
purity
of
her
innocence
which
makes
the
danger
he
is
a
bad
man
and
i
would
just
say
a
word
to
her
if
i
were
you
to
make
her
understand
that
his
coming
to
her
of
a
morning
is
not
desirable
upon
my
word
i
believe
there
is
nothing
he
likes
so
much
as
going
about
and
making
mischief
between
men
and
their
wives
thus
she
delivered
herself
and
louis
trevelyan
though
he
was
sore
and
angry
could
not
but
feel
that
she
had
taken
the
part
of
a
friend
all
that
she
had
said
had
been
true
all
that
she
had
said
to
him
he
had
said
to
himself
more
than
once
he
too
hated
the
man
he
believed
him
to
be
a
snake
in
the
grass
but
it
was
intolerably
bitter
to
him
that
he
should
be
warned
about
his
wife
conduct
by
any
living
human
being
that
he
to
whom
the
world
had
been
so
full
of
good
fortune
that
he
who
had
in
truth
taught
himself
to
think
that
he
deserved
so
much
good
fortune
should
be
made
the
subject
of
care
on
behalf
of
his
friend
because
of
danger
between
himself
and
his
wife
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
he
is
not
a
man
whom
i
like
myself
he
said
just
be
careful
louis
that
is
all
said
lady
milborough
and
then
she
was
gone
to
be
cautioned
about
his
wife
conduct
can
not
be
pleasant
to
any
man
and
it
was
very
unpleasant
to
louis
trevelyan
he
too
had
been
asked
a
question
about
sir
marmaduke
expected
visit
to
england
after
the
ladies
had
left
the
room
all
the
town
had
heard
of
it
except
himself
he
hardly
spoke
another
word
that
evening
till
the
brougham
was
announced
and
his
wife
had
observed
his
silence
when
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
he
together
with
his
wife
and
nora
rowley
he
immediately
asked
a
question
about
sir
marmaduke
emily
he
said
is
there
any
truth
in
a
report
i
hear
that
your
father
is
coming
home
no
answer
was
made
and
for
a
moment
or
two
there
was
silence
you
must
have
heard
of
it
then
he
said
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
nora
as
emily
will
not
reply
have
you
heard
anything
of
your
father
coming
yes
i
have
heard
of
it
said
nora
slowly
and
why
have
i
not
been
told
it
was
to
be
kept
a
secret
said
trevelyan
boldly
a
secret
from
me
and
everybody
else
knows
it
and
why
was
it
to
be
a
secret
colonel
osborne
did
not
wish
that
it
should
be
known
said
trevelyan
and
what
has
colonel
osborne
to
do
between
you
and
your
father
in
any
matter
with
which
i
may
not
be
made
acquainted
i
will
have
nothing
more
between
you
and
colonel
osborne
you
shall
not
see
colonel
osborne
do
you
hear
me
yes
i
hear
you
louis
and
do
you
mean
to
obey
me
by
g
you
shall
obey
me
remember
this
that
i
lay
my
positive
order
upon
you
that
you
shall
not
see
colonel
osborne
again
you
do
not
know
it
perhaps
but
you
are
already
forfeiting
your
reputation
as
an
honest
woman
and
bringing
disgrace
upon
me
by
your
familiarity
with
colonel
osborne
oh
louis
do
not
say
that
said
nora
you
had
better
let
him
speak
it
all
at
once
said
emily
i
have
said
what
i
have
got
to
say
it
is
now
only
necessary
that
you
should
give
me
your
solemn
assurance
that
you
will
obey
me
if
you
have
said
all
that
you
have
to
say
perhaps
you
will
listen
to
me
said
his
wife
i
will
listen
to
nothing
till
you
have
given
me
your
promise
then
i
certainly
shall
not
give
it
you
dear
emily
pray
pray
do
what
he
tells
you
said
nora
she
has
yet
to
learn
that
it
is
her
duty
to
do
as
i
tell
her
said
trevelyan
and
because
she
is
obstinate
and
will
not
learn
from
those
who
know
better
than
herself
what
a
woman
may
do
and
what
she
may
not
she
will
ruin
herself
and
destroy
my
happiness
i
know
that
you
have
destroyed
my
happiness
by
your
unreasonable
jealousy
said
the
wife
have
you
considered
what
i
must
feel
in
having
such
words
addressed
to
me
by
my
husband
if
i
am
fit
to
be
told
that
i
must
promise
not
to
see
any
man
living
i
can
not
be
fit
to
be
any
man
wife
then
she
burst
out
into
an
hysterical
fit
of
tears
and
in
this
condition
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
entered
her
house
and
hurried
up
to
her
own
room
indeed
she
has
not
been
to
blame
said
nora
to
trevelyan
on
the
staircase
why
has
there
been
a
secret
kept
from
me
between
her
and
this
man
and
that
too
after
i
had
cautioned
her
against
being
intimate
with
him
i
am
sorry
that
she
should
suffer
but
it
is
better
that
she
should
suffer
a
little
now
than
that
we
should
both
suffer
much
nora
endeavoured
to
explain
to
him
the
truth
about
the
committee
and
colonel
osborne
promised
influence
and
the
reason
why
there
was
to
be
a
secret
but
she
was
too
much
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
her
sister
to
make
the
matter
plain
and
he
was
too
much
angered
to
listen
to
her
he
shook
his
head
when
she
spoke
of
colonel
osborne
dislike
to
have
his
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
matter
all
the
world
knows
it
he
said
with
scornful
laughter
it
was
in
vain
that
nora
endeavoured
to
explain
to
him
that
though
all
the
world
might
know
it
emily
herself
had
only
heard
of
the
proposition
as
a
thing
quite
unsettled
as
to
which
nothing
at
present
should
be
spoken
openly
it
was
in
vain
to
endeavour
to
make
peace
on
that
night
nora
hurried
up
to
her
sister
and
found
that
the
hysterical
tears
had
again
given
place
to
anger
she
would
not
see
her
husband
unless
he
would
beg
her
pardon
and
he
would
not
see
her
unless
she
would
give
the
promise
he
demanded
and
the
husband
and
wife
did
not
see
each
other
again
on
that
night
chapter
iv
hugh
stanbury
illustration
it
has
been
already
stated
that
nora
rowley
was
not
quite
so
well
disposed
as
perhaps
she
ought
to
have
been
to
fall
in
love
with
the
honourable
charles
glascock
there
having
come
upon
her
the
habit
of
comparing
him
with
another
gentleman
whenever
this
duty
of
falling
in
love
with
glascock
was
exacted
from
her
that
other
gentleman
was
one
with
whom
she
knew
that
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
fall
in
love
because
he
had
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
and
the
other
gentleman
was
equally
aware
that
it
was
not
open
to
him
to
fall
in
love
with
nora
rowley
for
the
same
reason
in
regard
to
such
matters
nora
rowley
had
been
properly
brought
up
having
been
made
to
understand
by
the
best
and
most
cautious
of
mothers
that
in
that
matter
of
falling
in
love
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
bread
and
cheese
should
be
considered
romance
is
a
very
pretty
thing
lady
rowley
had
been
wont
to
say
to
her
daughters
and
i
do
think
life
would
be
worth
having
without
a
little
of
it
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
think
that
either
of
my
girls
would
marry
a
man
only
because
he
had
money
but
you
ca
even
be
romantic
without
something
to
eat
and
drink
nora
thoroughly
understood
all
this
and
being
well
aware
that
her
fortune
in
the
world
if
it
ever
was
to
be
made
at
all
could
only
be
made
by
marriage
had
laid
down
for
herself
certain
hard
lines
lines
intended
to
be
as
fast
as
they
were
hard
let
what
might
come
to
her
in
the
way
of
likings
and
dislikings
let
the
temptation
to
her
be
ever
so
strong
she
would
never
allow
her
heart
to
rest
on
a
man
who
if
he
should
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
would
not
have
the
means
of
supporting
her
there
were
many
she
knew
who
would
condemn
such
a
resolution
as
cold
selfish
and
heartless
she
heard
people
saying
so
daily
she
read
in
books
that
it
ought
to
be
so
regarded
but
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
respect
the
judgment
neither
of
the
people
nor
of
the
books
to
be
poor
alone
to
have
to
live
without
a
husband
to
look
forward
to
a
life
in
which
there
would
be
nothing
of
a
career
almost
nothing
to
do
to
await
the
vacuity
of
an
existence
in
which
she
would
be
useful
to
no
one
was
a
destiny
which
she
could
teach
herself
to
endure
because
it
might
probably
be
forced
upon
her
by
necessity
were
her
father
to
die
there
would
hardly
be
bread
for
that
female
flock
to
eat
as
it
was
she
was
eating
the
bread
of
a
man
in
whose
house
she
was
no
more
than
a
visitor
the
lot
of
a
woman
as
she
often
told
herself
was
wretched
unfortunate
almost
degrading
for
a
woman
such
as
herself
there
was
no
path
open
to
her
energy
other
than
that
of
getting
a
husband
nora
rowley
thought
of
all
this
till
she
was
almost
sick
of
the
prospect
of
her
life
especially
sick
of
it
when
she
was
told
with
much
authority
by
the
lady
milboroughs
of
her
acquaintance
that
it
was
her
bounden
duty
to
fall
in
love
with
glascock
as
to
falling
in
love
with
glascock
she
had
not
as
yet
quite
made
up
her
mind
there
was
so
much
to
be
said
on
that
side
of
the
question
if
such
falling
in
love
could
only
be
made
possible
but
she
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
never
fall
in
love
with
a
poor
man
in
spite
however
of
all
that
she
felt
herself
compelled
to
make
comparisons
between
glascock
and
one
hugh
stanbury
a
gentleman
who
had
not
a
shilling
hugh
stanbury
had
been
at
college
the
most
intimate
friend
of
louis
trevelyan
and
at
oxford
had
been
in
spite
of
successes
a
bigger
man
than
his
friend
stanbury
had
not
taken
so
high
a
degree
as
trevelyan
indeed
had
not
gone
out
in
honours
at
all
he
had
done
little
for
the
credit
of
his
college
and
had
never
put
himself
in
the
way
of
wrapping
himself
up
for
life
in
the
scanty
lambswool
of
a
fellowship
but
he
had
won
for
himself
reputation
as
a
clever
speaker
as
a
man
who
had
learned
much
that
college
tutors
do
not
profess
to
teach
as
a
fellow
who
having
the
world
as
an
oyster
before
him
which
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
open
would
certainly
find
either
a
knife
or
a
sword
with
which
to
open
it
immediately
on
leaving
college
he
had
come
to
town
and
had
entered
himself
at
lincoln
inn
now
at
the
time
of
our
story
he
was
a
barrister
of
four
years
standing
but
had
never
yet
made
a
guinea
he
had
never
made
a
guinea
by
his
work
as
a
barrister
and
was
beginning
to
doubt
of
himself
whether
he
ever
would
do
so
not
as
he
knew
well
that
guineas
are
generally
made
with
ease
by
barristers
of
four
years
standing
but
because
as
he
said
to
his
friends
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
the
knack
of
it
he
did
not
know
an
attorney
in
the
world
and
could
not
conceive
how
any
attorney
should
ever
be
induced
to
apply
to
him
for
legal
aid
he
had
done
his
work
of
learning
his
trade
about
as
well
as
other
young
men
but
had
had
no
means
of
distinguishing
himself
within
his
reach
he
went
the
western
circuit
because
his
aunt
old
miss
stanbury
lived
at
exeter
but
as
he
declared
of
himself
had
he
had
another
aunt
living
at
york
he
would
have
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
guide
him
in
his
choice
he
sat
idle
in
the
courts
and
hated
himself
for
so
sitting
so
it
had
been
with
him
for
two
years
without
any
consolation
or
additional
burden
from
other
employment
than
that
of
his
profession
after
that
by
some
chance
he
had
become
acquainted
with
the
editor
of
the
daily
record
and
by
degrees
had
taken
to
the
writing
of
articles
he
had
been
told
by
all
his
friends
and
especially
by
trevelyan
that
if
he
did
this
he
might
as
well
sell
his
gown
and
wig
he
declared
in
reply
that
he
had
no
objection
to
sell
his
gown
and
wig
he
did
not
see
how
he
should
ever
make
more
money
out
of
them
than
he
would
do
by
such
sale
but
for
the
articles
which
he
wrote
he
received
instant
payment
a
process
which
he
found
to
be
most
consolatory
most
comfortable
and
as
he
said
to
trevelyan
as
warm
to
him
as
a
blanket
in
winter
trevelyan
who
was
a
year
younger
than
stanbury
had
taken
upon
himself
to
be
very
angry
he
professed
that
he
did
not
think
much
of
the
trade
of
a
journalist
and
told
stanbury
that
he
was
sinking
from
the
highest
to
almost
the
lowest
business
by
which
an
educated
man
and
a
gentleman
could
earn
his
bread
stanbury
had
simply
replied
that
he
saw
some
bread
on
the
one
side
but
none
on
the
other
and
that
bread
from
some
side
was
indispensable
to
him
then
there
had
come
to
be
that
famous
war
between
great
britain
and
the
republic
of
patagonia
and
hugh
stanbury
had
been
sent
out
as
a
special
correspondent
by
the
editor
and
proprietor
of
the
daily
record
his
letters
had
been
much
read
and
had
called
up
a
great
deal
of
newspaper
pugnacity
he
had
made
important
statements
which
had
been
flatly
denied
and
found
to
be
utterly
false
which
again
had
been
warmly
reasserted
and
proved
to
be
most
remarkably
true
to
the
letter
in
this
way
the
correspondence
and
he
as
its
author
became
so
much
talked
about
that
on
his
return
to
england
he
did
actually
sell
his
gown
and
wig
and
declare
to
his
friends
and
to
trevelyan
among
the
number
that
he
intended
to
look
to
journalism
for
his
future
career
he
had
been
often
at
the
house
in
curzon
street
in
the
earliest
happy
days
of
his
friend
marriage
and
had
thus
become
acquainted
intimately
acquainted
with
nora
rowley
and
now
again
since
his
return
from
patagonia
that
acquaintance
had
been
renewed
quite
lately
since
the
actual
sale
of
that
wig
and
gown
had
been
effected
he
had
not
been
there
so
frequently
as
before
because
trevelyan
had
expressed
his
indignation
almost
too
openly
that
such
a
man
as
you
should
be
so
trevelyan
had
said
is
a
thing
that
i
can
not
understand
is
a
man
when
he
finds
it
improbable
that
he
shall
be
able
to
leap
his
horse
over
a
house
what
you
had
to
do
had
been
done
by
hundreds
before
you
what
i
had
to
do
has
never
yet
been
done
by
any
man
replied
stanbury
i
had
to
live
upon
nothing
till
the
lucky
hour
should
strike
i
think
you
have
been
cowardly
said
trevelyan
even
this
had
made
no
quarrel
between
the
two
men
but
stanbury
had
expressed
himself
annoyed
by
his
friend
language
and
partly
on
that
account
and
partly
perhaps
on
another
had
stayed
away
from
curzon
street
as
nora
rowley
had
made
comparisons
about
him
so
had
he
made
comparisons
about
her
he
had
owned
to
himself
that
had
it
been
possible
that
he
should
marry
he
would
willingly
entrust
his
happiness
to
miss
rowley
and
he
had
thought
once
or
twice
that
trevelyan
had
wished
that
such
an
arrangement
might
be
made
at
some
future
day
trevelyan
had
always
been
much
more
sanguine
in
expecting
success
for
his
friend
at
the
bar
than
stanbury
had
been
for
himself
it
might
well
be
that
such
a
man
as
trevelyan
might
think
that
a
clever
rising
barrister
would
be
an
excellent
husband
for
his
but
that
a
man
earning
a
precarious
living
as
a
writer
for
a
penny
paper
would
be
by
no
means
so
desirable
a
connection
stanbury
as
he
thought
of
this
declared
to
himself
that
he
would
not
care
two
straws
for
trevelyan
in
the
matter
if
he
could
see
his
way
without
other
impediments
but
the
other
impediments
were
there
in
such
strength
and
numbers
as
to
make
him
feel
that
it
could
not
have
been
intended
by
fate
that
he
should
take
to
himself
a
wife
although
those
letters
of
his
to
the
daily
record
had
been
so
successful
he
had
never
yet
been
able
to
earn
by
writing
above
or
thirty
pounds
a
month
if
that
might
be
continued
to
him
he
could
live
upon
it
himself
but
even
with
his
moderate
views
it
would
not
suffice
for
himself
and
family
he
had
told
trevelyan
that
while
living
as
an
expectant
barrister
he
had
no
means
of
subsistence
in
this
as
trevelyan
knew
he
was
not
strictly
correct
there
was
an
allowance
of
a
year
coming
to
him
from
the
aunt
whose
residence
at
exeter
had
induced
him
to
devote
himself
to
the
western
circuit
his
father
had
been
a
clergyman
with
a
small
living
in
devonshire
and
had
now
been
dead
some
fifteen
years
his
mother
and
two
sisters
were
still
living
in
a
small
cottage
in
his
late
father
parish
on
the
interest
of
the
money
arising
from
a
life
insurance
some
pittance
from
sixty
to
seventy
pounds
a
year
was
all
they
had
among
them
but
there
was
a
rich
aunt
miss
stanbury
to
whom
had
come
considerable
wealth
in
a
manner
most
romantic
the
little
tale
shall
be
told
before
this
larger
tale
is
completed
and
this
aunt
had
undertaken
to
educate
and
place
out
in
the
world
her
nephew
hugh
so
hugh
had
been
sent
to
harrow
and
then
to
oxford
where
he
had
much
displeased
his
aunt
by
not
accomplishing
great
things
and
then
had
been
set
down
to
make
his
fortune
as
a
barrister
in
london
with
an
allowance
of
a
year
his
aunt
having
paid
moreover
certain
fees
for
entrance
tuition
and
the
like
the
very
hour
in
which
miss
stanbury
learned
that
her
nephew
was
writing
for
a
penny
newspaper
she
sent
off
a
dispatch
to
tell
him
that
he
must
give
up
her
or
the
penny
paper
he
replied
by
saying
that
he
felt
himself
called
upon
to
earn
his
bread
in
the
only
line
from
which
as
it
seemed
to
him
bread
would
be
forthcoming
by
return
of
post
he
got
another
letter
to
say
that
he
might
draw
for
the
quarter
then
becoming
due
but
that
that
would
be
the
last
and
it
was
the
last
stanbury
made
an
ineffectual
effort
to
induce
his
aunt
to
make
over
the
allowance
or
at
least
a
part
of
it
to
his
mother
and
sisters
but
the
old
lady
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
the
request
she
never
had
given
and
at
that
moment
did
not
intend
to
give
a
shilling
to
the
widow
and
daughters
of
her
brother
nor
did
she
intend
or
had
she
ever
intended
to
leave
a
shilling
of
her
money
to
hugh
stanbury
as
she
had
very
often
told
him
the
money
was
at
her
death
to
go
back
to
the
people
from
whom
it
had
come
to
her
when
nora
rowley
made
those
comparisons
between
hugh
stanbury
and
charles
glascock
they
were
always
wound
up
very
much
in
favour
of
the
briefless
barrister
it
was
not
that
he
was
the
handsomer
man
for
he
was
by
no
means
handsome
nor
was
he
the
bigger
man
for
glascock
was
six
feet
tall
nor
was
he
better
dressed
for
stanbury
was
untidy
rather
than
otherwise
in
his
outward
person
nor
had
he
any
air
of
fashion
or
special
grace
to
recommend
him
for
he
was
undoubtedly
an
man
but
there
was
a
glance
of
sunshine
in
his
eye
and
a
sweetness
in
the
curl
of
his
mouth
when
he
smiled
which
made
nora
feel
that
it
would
have
been
all
up
with
her
had
she
not
made
so
very
strong
a
law
for
her
own
guidance
stanbury
was
a
man
about
five
feet
ten
with
shoulders
more
than
broad
in
proportion
stout
limbed
rather
awkward
of
his
gait
with
large
feet
and
hands
with
soft
wavy
light
hair
with
light
grey
eyes
with
a
broad
but
by
no
means
ugly
nose
his
mouth
and
lips
were
large
and
he
rarely
showed
his
teeth
he
wore
no
other
beard
than
whiskers
which
he
was
apt
to
cut
away
through
heaviness
of
his
hand
in
shaving
till
nora
longed
to
bid
him
be
more
careful
he
care
what
sort
of
a
guy
he
makes
of
himself
she
once
said
to
her
sister
almost
angrily
he
is
a
plain
man
and
he
knows
it
emily
had
replied
trevelyan
was
doubtless
a
handsome
man
and
it
was
almost
on
nora
tongue
to
say
something
on
the
subject
hugh
stanbury
was
reputed
to
be
somewhat
hot
in
spirit
and
manner
he
would
be
very
sage
in
argument
pounding
down
his
ideas
on
politics
religion
or
social
life
with
his
fist
as
well
as
his
voice
he
was
quick
perhaps
at
making
antipathies
and
quick
too
in
making
friendships
impressionable
demonstrative
eager
rapid
in
his
movements
sometimes
to
the
great
detriment
of
his
shins
and
knuckles
and
he
possessed
the
sweetest
temper
that
was
ever
given
to
a
man
for
the
blessing
of
a
woman
this
was
the
man
between
whom
and
glascock
nora
rowley
found
it
to
be
impossible
not
to
make
comparisons
on
the
very
day
after
lady
milborough
dinner
party
stanbury
overtook
trevelyan
in
the
street
and
asked
his
friend
where
he
was
going
eastward
trevelyan
was
on
his
way
to
call
upon
his
lawyer
and
said
so
but
he
did
not
say
why
he
was
going
to
his
lawyer
he
had
sent
to
his
wife
by
nora
that
morning
to
know
whether
she
would
make
to
him
the
promise
he
required
the
only
answer
which
nora
could
draw
from
her
sister
was
a
counter
question
demanding
whether
he
would
ask
her
pardon
for
the
injury
he
had
done
her
nora
had
been
most
eager
most
anxious
most
conciliatory
as
a
messenger
but
no
good
had
come
of
these
messages
and
trevelyan
had
gone
forth
to
tell
all
his
trouble
to
his
family
lawyer
old
bideawhile
had
been
his
father
ancient
and
esteemed
friend
and
he
could
tell
things
to
bideawhile
which
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
tell
to
any
other
living
man
and
he
could
generally
condescend
to
accept
bideawhile
advice
knowing
that
his
father
before
him
had
been
guided
by
the
same
but
you
are
out
of
your
way
for
lincoln
inn
fields
said
stanbury
i
have
to
call
at
twining
and
where
are
you
going
i
have
been
three
times
round
james
park
to
collect
my
thoughts
said
stanbury
and
now
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
daily
fleet
street
it
is
my
custom
of
an
afternoon
i
am
prepared
to
instruct
the
british
public
of
on
any
subject
as
per
order
from
the
downfall
of
a
european
compact
to
the
price
of
a
london
mutton
chop
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
about
it
said
trevelyan
after
a
pause
not
another
word
how
should
there
be
aunt
jemima
has
already
drawn
tight
the
purse
strings
and
it
would
soon
be
the
casual
ward
in
earnest
if
it
were
not
for
the
daily
god
bless
the
daily
only
think
what
a
thing
it
is
to
have
all
subjects
open
to
one
from
the
destinies
of
france
to
the
profit
proper
to
a
butcher
if
you
like
it
i
do
like
it
it
may
not
be
altogether
honest
i
do
know
what
is
but
it
a
deal
honester
than
defending
thieves
and
bamboozling
juries
how
is
your
wife
she
pretty
well
thank
you
stanbury
knew
at
once
from
the
tone
of
his
friend
voice
that
there
was
something
wrong
and
louis
the
less
he
said
asking
after
trevelyan
child
he
all
right
and
miss
rowley
when
one
begins
one
inquiries
one
is
bound
to
go
through
the
whole
family
miss
rowley
is
pretty
well
said
trevelyan
previously
to
this
trevelyan
when
speaking
of
his
to
stanbury
had
always
called
her
nora
and
had
been
wont
to
speak
of
her
as
though
she
were
almost
as
much
the
friend
of
one
of
them
as
of
the
other
the
change
of
tone
on
this
occasion
was
in
truth
occasioned
by
the
sadness
of
the
man
thoughts
in
reference
to
his
wife
but
stanbury
attributed
it
to
another
cause
he
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
he
said
to
himself
and
at
least
he
should
not
show
me
that
he
is
then
they
parted
trevelyan
going
into
bank
and
stanbury
passing
on
towards
the
office
of
the
daily
stanbury
had
in
truth
been
altogether
mistaken
as
to
the
state
of
his
friend
mind
on
that
morning
trevelyan
although
he
had
according
to
his
custom
put
in
a
word
in
condemnation
of
the
newspaper
line
of
life
was
at
the
moment
thinking
whether
he
would
not
tell
all
his
trouble
to
hugh
stanbury
he
knew
that
he
should
not
find
anywhere
not
even
in
bideawhile
a
more
friendly
or
more
trustworthy
listener
when
nora
rowley
name
had
been
mentioned
he
had
not
thought
of
her
he
had
simply
repeated
the
name
with
the
usual
answer
he
was
at
the
moment
cautioning
himself
against
a
confidence
which
after
all
might
not
be
necessary
and
which
on
this
occasion
was
not
made
when
one
is
in
trouble
it
is
a
great
ease
to
tell
trouble
to
a
friend
but
then
one
should
always
wash
one
dirty
linen
at
home
the
latter
consideration
prevailed
and
trevelyan
allowed
his
friend
to
go
on
without
burdening
him
with
the
story
of
that
domestic
quarrel
nor
did
he
on
that
occasion
tell
it
to
bideawhile
for
bideawhile
was
not
found
at
his
chambers
chapter
shewing
how
the
quarrel
progressed
trevelyan
got
back
to
his
own
house
at
about
three
and
on
going
into
the
library
found
on
his
table
a
letter
to
him
addressed
in
his
wife
handwriting
he
opened
it
quickly
hoping
to
find
that
promise
which
he
had
demanded
and
resolving
that
if
it
were
made
he
would
at
once
become
affectionate
yielding
and
gentle
to
his
wife
but
there
was
not
a
word
written
by
his
wife
within
the
envelope
it
contained
simply
another
letter
already
opened
addressed
to
her
this
letter
had
been
brought
up
to
her
during
her
husband
absence
from
the
house
and
was
as
follows
acrobats
thursday
dear
emily
i
have
just
come
from
the
colonial
office
it
is
all
settled
and
sir
has
been
sent
for
of
course
you
will
tell
now
yours
o
the
letter
was
of
course
from
colonel
osborne
and
trevelyan
when
she
received
it
had
had
great
doubts
whether
she
would
enclose
it
to
her
husband
opened
or
unopened
she
had
hitherto
refused
to
make
the
promise
which
her
husband
exacted
but
nevertheless
she
was
minded
to
obey
him
had
he
included
in
his
demand
any
requirement
that
she
should
receive
no
letter
from
colonel
osborne
she
would
not
have
opened
this
one
but
nothing
had
been
said
about
letters
and
she
would
not
shew
herself
to
be
afraid
so
she
read
the
note
and
then
sent
it
down
to
be
put
on
trevelyan
table
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
him
if
he
is
not
altogether
blinded
it
will
show
him
how
cruelly
he
has
wronged
me
said
she
to
her
sister
she
was
sitting
at
the
time
with
her
boy
in
her
lap
telling
herself
that
the
child
features
were
in
all
respects
the
very
same
as
his
father
and
that
come
what
come
might
the
child
should
always
be
taught
by
her
to
love
and
respect
his
father
and
then
there
came
a
horrible
thought
what
if
the
child
should
be
taken
away
from
her
if
this
quarrel
out
of
which
she
saw
no
present
mode
of
escape
were
to
lead
to
a
separation
between
her
and
her
husband
would
not
the
law
and
the
judges
and
the
courts
and
all
the
lady
milboroughs
of
their
joint
acquaintance
into
the
bargain
say
that
the
child
should
go
with
his
father
the
judges
and
the
courts
and
the
lady
milboroughs
would
of
course
say
that
she
was
the
sinner
and
what
could
she
do
without
her
boy
would
not
any
humility
any
grovelling
in
the
dust
be
better
for
her
than
that
it
is
a
very
poor
thing
to
be
a
woman
she
said
to
her
sister
it
is
perhaps
better
than
being
a
dog
said
nora
but
of
course
we
ca
compare
ourselves
to
men
it
would
be
better
to
be
a
dog
one
would
be
made
to
suffer
so
much
when
a
puppy
is
taken
away
from
its
mother
she
is
bad
enough
for
a
few
days
but
she
gets
over
it
in
a
week
there
was
a
pause
then
for
a
few
moments
nora
knew
well
which
way
ran
the
current
of
her
sister
thoughts
and
had
nothing
at
the
present
moment
which
she
could
say
on
that
subject
it
is
very
hard
for
a
woman
to
know
what
to
do
continued
emily
but
if
she
is
to
marry
i
think
she
had
better
marry
a
fool
after
all
a
fool
generally
knows
that
he
is
a
fool
and
will
trust
some
one
though
he
may
not
trust
his
wife
i
will
never
wittingly
marry
a
fool
said
nora
you
will
marry
glascock
of
course
i
do
say
that
he
is
a
fool
but
i
do
not
think
he
has
that
kind
of
strength
which
shows
itself
in
perversity
if
he
asked
me
i
should
not
have
him
and
he
will
never
ask
me
he
will
ask
you
and
of
course
you
take
him
why
not
you
be
otherwise
than
a
woman
and
you
must
marry
and
this
man
is
a
gentleman
and
will
be
a
peer
there
is
nothing
on
earth
against
him
except
that
he
does
not
set
the
thames
on
fire
louis
intends
to
set
the
thames
on
fire
some
day
and
see
what
comes
of
it
all
the
same
i
shall
not
marry
glascock
a
woman
can
die
at
any
rate
said
nora
no
she
ca
a
woman
must
be
decent
and
to
die
of
want
is
very
indecent
she
ca
die
and
she
must
be
in
want
and
she
to
be
a
burden
i
suppose
it
was
thought
necessary
that
every
man
should
have
two
to
choose
from
and
therefore
there
are
so
many
more
of
us
than
the
world
wants
i
wonder
whether
you
mind
taking
that
to
his
table
i
do
like
to
send
it
by
the
servant
and
i
do
want
to
go
myself
then
nora
had
taken
the
letter
down
and
left
it
where
louis
trevelyan
would
be
sure
to
find
it
he
did
find
it
and
was
sorely
disappointed
when
he
perceived
that
it
contained
no
word
from
his
wife
to
himself
he
opened
colonel
osborne
note
and
read
it
and
became
as
he
did
so
almost
more
angry
than
before
who
was
this
man
that
he
should
dare
to
address
another
man
wife
as
dear
emily
at
the
moment
trevelyan
remembered
well
enough
that
he
had
heard
the
man
so
call
his
wife
that
it
had
been
done
openly
in
his
presence
and
had
not
given
him
a
thought
but
lady
rowley
and
sir
marmaduke
had
then
been
present
also
and
that
man
on
that
occasion
had
been
the
old
friend
of
the
old
father
and
not
the
young
friend
of
the
young
daughter
trevelyan
could
hardly
reason
about
it
but
felt
that
whereas
the
one
was
not
improper
the
other
was
grossly
impertinent
and
even
wicked
and
then
again
his
wife
his
emily
was
to
show
to
him
to
her
husband
or
was
not
to
show
to
him
the
letter
which
she
received
from
this
man
the
letter
in
which
she
was
addressed
as
dear
emily
according
to
this
man
judgment
and
wish
and
not
according
to
his
judgment
and
wish
not
according
to
the
judgment
and
wish
of
him
who
was
her
husband
her
lord
and
her
master
of
course
you
will
tell
t
now
this
was
intolerable
to
him
it
made
him
feel
that
he
was
to
be
regarded
as
second
and
this
man
to
be
regarded
as
first
and
then
he
began
to
recapitulate
all
the
good
things
he
had
done
for
his
wife
and
all
the
causes
which
he
had
given
her
for
gratitude
had
he
not
taken
her
to
his
bosom
and
bestowed
upon
her
the
half
of
all
that
he
had
simply
for
herself
asking
for
nothing
more
than
her
love
he
had
possessed
money
position
a
name
all
that
makes
life
worth
having
he
had
found
her
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
world
with
no
fortune
with
no
advantages
of
family
or
social
standing
so
circumstanced
that
any
friend
would
have
warned
him
against
such
a
marriage
but
he
had
given
her
his
heart
and
his
hand
and
his
house
and
had
asked
for
nothing
in
return
but
that
he
should
be
all
in
all
to
her
that
he
should
be
her
one
god
upon
earth
and
he
had
done
more
even
than
this
bring
your
sister
he
had
said
the
house
shall
be
big
enough
for
her
also
and
she
shall
be
my
sister
as
well
as
yours
who
had
ever
done
more
for
a
woman
or
shown
a
more
absolute
confidence
and
now
what
was
the
return
he
received
she
was
not
contented
with
her
one
god
upon
earth
but
must
make
to
herself
other
gods
another
god
and
that
too
out
of
a
lump
of
the
basest
clay
to
be
found
around
her
he
thought
that
he
could
remember
to
have
heard
it
said
in
early
days
long
before
he
himself
had
had
an
idea
of
marrying
that
no
man
should
look
for
a
wife
from
among
the
tropics
that
women
educated
amidst
the
languors
of
those
sunny
climes
rarely
came
to
possess
those
high
ideas
of
conjugal
duty
and
feminine
truth
which
a
man
should
regard
as
the
first
requisites
of
a
good
wife
as
he
thought
of
all
this
he
almost
regretted
that
he
had
ever
visited
the
mandarins
or
ever
heard
the
name
of
sir
marmaduke
rowley
he
should
have
nourished
no
such
thoughts
in
his
heart
he
had
indeed
been
generous
to
his
wife
and
to
his
wife
family
but
we
may
almost
say
that
the
man
who
is
really
generous
in
such
matters
is
unconscious
of
his
own
generosity
the
giver
who
gives
the
most
gives
and
does
not
know
that
he
gives
and
had
not
she
given
too
in
that
matter
of
giving
between
a
man
and
his
wife
if
each
gives
all
the
two
are
equal
let
the
things
given
be
what
they
may
king
cophetua
did
nothing
for
his
beggar
maid
unless
she
were
to
him
after
he
had
married
her
as
royal
a
queen
as
though
he
had
taken
her
from
the
oldest
stock
of
reigning
families
then
extant
trevelyan
knew
all
this
himself
had
said
so
to
himself
a
score
of
times
though
not
probably
in
spoken
words
or
formed
sentences
but
that
all
was
equal
between
himself
and
the
wife
of
his
bosom
had
been
a
thing
ascertained
by
him
as
a
certainty
there
was
no
debt
of
gratitude
from
her
to
him
which
he
did
not
acknowledge
to
exist
also
as
from
him
to
her
but
yet
in
his
anger
he
could
not
keep
himself
from
thinking
of
the
gifts
he
had
showered
upon
her
and
he
had
been
was
would
ever
be
if
she
would
only
allow
it
so
true
to
her
he
had
selected
no
other
friend
to
take
her
place
in
his
councils
there
was
no
dear
mary
or
dear
augusta
with
whom
he
had
secrets
to
be
kept
from
his
wife
when
there
arose
with
him
any
question
of
interest
question
of
interest
such
as
was
this
of
the
return
of
sir
marmaduke
to
her
he
would
show
it
in
all
its
bearings
to
his
wife
he
had
his
secrets
too
but
his
secrets
had
all
been
made
secrets
for
her
also
there
was
not
a
woman
in
the
world
in
whose
company
he
took
special
delight
in
her
absence
and
if
there
had
been
how
much
less
would
have
been
her
ground
of
complaint
let
a
man
have
any
such
friendships
what
friendships
he
may
he
does
not
disgrace
his
wife
he
felt
himself
to
be
so
true
of
heart
that
he
desired
no
such
friendships
but
for
a
man
indulging
in
such
friendships
there
might
be
excuse
even
though
a
man
be
false
a
woman
is
not
shamed
and
brought
unto
the
dust
before
all
the
world
but
the
slightest
rumour
on
a
woman
name
is
a
load
of
infamy
on
her
husband
shoulders
it
was
not
enough
for
cæsar
that
his
wife
should
be
true
it
was
necessary
to
cæsar
that
she
should
not
even
be
suspected
trevelyan
told
himself
that
he
suspected
his
wife
of
no
sin
god
forbid
that
it
should
ever
come
to
that
both
for
his
sake
and
for
hers
and
above
all
for
the
sake
of
that
boy
who
was
so
dear
to
them
both
but
there
would
be
the
vile
whispers
and
dirty
slanders
would
be
dropped
from
envious
tongues
into
envious
ears
and
minds
prone
to
evil
would
think
evil
of
him
and
of
his
had
not
lady
milborough
already
cautioned
him
oh
that
he
should
have
lived
to
have
been
cautioned
about
his
wife
that
he
should
be
told
that
eyes
outside
had
looked
into
the
sacred
shrine
of
his
heart
and
seen
that
things
there
were
fatally
amiss
and
yet
lady
milborough
was
quite
right
had
he
not
in
his
hand
at
this
moment
a
document
that
proved
her
to
be
right
dear
emily
he
took
this
note
and
crushed
it
in
his
fist
and
then
pulled
it
into
fragments
but
what
should
he
do
there
was
first
of
all
considerations
the
duty
which
he
owed
to
his
wife
and
the
love
which
he
bore
her
that
she
was
ignorant
and
innocent
he
was
sure
but
then
she
was
so
contumacious
that
he
hardly
knew
how
to
take
a
step
in
the
direction
of
guarding
her
from
the
effects
of
her
ignorance
and
maintaining
for
her
the
advantages
of
her
innocence
he
was
her
master
and
she
must
know
that
he
was
her
master
but
how
was
he
to
proceed
when
she
refused
to
obey
the
plainest
and
most
necessary
command
which
he
laid
upon
her
let
a
man
be
ever
so
much
his
wife
master
he
can
not
maintain
his
masterdom
by
any
power
which
the
law
places
in
his
hands
he
had
asked
his
wife
for
a
promise
of
obedience
and
she
would
not
give
it
to
him
what
was
he
to
do
next
he
could
no
doubt
at
least
he
thought
so
keep
the
man
from
her
presence
he
could
order
the
servant
not
to
admit
the
man
and
the
servant
would
doubtless
obey
him
but
to
what
a
condition
would
he
then
have
been
brought
would
not
the
world
then
be
over
for
him
over
for
him
as
the
husband
of
a
wife
whom
he
could
not
love
unless
he
respected
her
better
that
there
should
be
no
such
world
than
call
in
the
aid
of
a
servant
to
guard
the
conduct
of
his
wife
as
he
thought
of
it
all
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
she
would
not
obey
him
and
give
him
this
promise
they
must
be
separated
he
would
not
live
with
her
he
would
not
give
her
the
privileges
of
his
wife
if
she
refused
to
render
to
him
the
obedience
which
was
his
privilege
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
convinced
he
was
that
he
ought
not
to
yield
to
her
let
her
once
yield
to
him
and
then
his
tenderness
should
begin
and
there
should
be
no
limit
to
it
but
he
would
not
see
her
till
she
had
yielded
he
would
not
see
her
and
if
he
should
find
that
she
did
see
colonel
osborne
then
he
would
tell
her
that
she
could
no
longer
dwell
under
the
same
roof
with
him
his
resolution
on
these
points
was
very
strong
and
yet
there
came
over
him
a
feeling
that
it
was
his
duty
to
be
gentle
there
was
a
feeling
also
that
that
privilege
of
receiving
obedience
which
was
so
indubitably
his
own
could
only
be
maintained
by
certain
wise
practices
on
his
part
in
which
gentleness
must
predominate
wives
are
bound
to
obey
their
husbands
but
obedience
can
not
be
exacted
from
wives
as
it
may
from
servants
by
aid
of
law
and
with
penalties
or
as
from
a
horse
by
punishments
and
manger
curtailments
a
man
should
be
master
in
his
own
house
but
he
should
make
his
mastery
palatable
equitable
smooth
soft
to
the
touch
a
thing
almost
unfelt
how
was
he
to
do
all
this
now
when
he
had
already
given
an
order
to
which
obedience
had
been
refused
unless
under
certain
stipulations
an
agreement
with
which
would
be
degradation
to
him
he
had
pointed
out
to
his
wife
her
duty
and
she
had
said
she
would
do
her
duty
as
pointed
out
on
condition
that
he
would
beg
her
pardon
for
having
pointed
it
out
this
he
could
not
and
would
not
do
let
the
heavens
fall
and
the
falling
of
the
heavens
in
this
case
was
a
separation
between
him
and
his
wife
but
he
would
not
consent
to
such
injustice
as
that
but
what
was
he
to
do
at
this
moment
especially
with
reference
to
that
note
which
he
had
destroyed
at
last
he
resolved
to
write
to
his
wife
and
he
consequently
did
write
and
send
to
her
the
following
letter
may
dearest
emily
if
colonel
osborne
should
write
to
you
again
it
will
be
better
that
you
should
not
open
his
letter
as
you
know
his
handwriting
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
so
arranging
should
any
further
letter
come
from
colonel
osborne
addressed
to
you
you
had
better
put
it
under
cover
to
me
and
take
no
notice
of
it
yourself
i
shall
dine
at
the
club
we
were
to
have
gone
to
peacock
in
the
evening
you
had
better
write
a
line
to
say
that
we
shall
not
be
there
i
am
very
sorry
that
nora
should
lose
her
evening
pray
think
very
carefully
over
what
i
have
asked
of
you
my
request
to
you
is
that
you
shall
give
me
a
promise
that
you
will
not
willingly
see
colonel
osborne
again
of
course
you
will
understand
that
this
is
not
supposed
to
extend
to
accidental
meetings
as
to
which
should
they
occur
and
they
would
be
sure
to
occur
you
would
find
that
they
would
be
wholly
unnoticed
by
me
but
i
must
request
that
you
will
comply
with
my
wish
in
this
matter
if
you
will
send
for
me
i
will
go
to
you
instantly
and
after
one
word
from
you
to
the
desired
effect
you
will
find
that
there
will
be
no
recurrence
by
me
to
a
subject
so
hateful
as
i
have
done
and
am
doing
what
i
think
to
be
right
i
can
not
stultify
myself
by
saying
that
i
think
i
have
been
wrong
yours
always
dearest
emily
with
the
most
thorough
love
louis
trevelyan
this
letter
he
himself
put
on
his
wife
table
and
then
he
went
out
to
his
club
chapter
vi
shewing
how
reconciliation
was
made
look
at
that
said
trevelyan
when
her
sister
came
into
her
room
about
an
hour
before
nora
read
the
letter
and
then
asked
her
sister
what
she
meant
to
do
i
have
written
to
peacock
i
do
know
what
else
i
can
do
it
is
very
hard
upon
you
that
you
should
have
been
kept
at
home
but
i
do
suppose
glascock
would
have
been
at
mrs
peacock
and
what
else
will
you
do
emily
nothing
simply
live
deserted
and
forlorn
till
he
shall
choose
to
find
his
wits
again
there
is
nothing
else
that
a
woman
can
do
if
he
chooses
to
dine
at
his
club
every
day
i
ca
help
it
we
must
put
off
all
the
engagements
and
that
will
be
hard
upon
you
do
talk
about
me
it
is
too
terrible
to
think
that
there
should
be
such
a
quarrel
what
can
i
do
have
i
been
wrong
simply
do
what
he
tells
you
whether
it
is
wrong
or
right
if
right
it
ought
to
be
done
and
if
it
wrong
it
will
not
be
your
fault
that
very
easily
said
and
it
sounds
logical
but
you
must
know
it
unreasonable
i
do
care
about
reason
he
is
your
husband
and
if
he
wishes
it
you
should
do
it
and
what
will
be
the
harm
you
do
mean
to
see
colonel
osborne
any
more
you
have
already
said
that
he
not
to
be
admitted
i
have
said
that
nobody
is
to
be
admitted
louis
has
driven
me
to
that
how
can
i
look
the
servant
in
the
face
and
tell
him
that
any
special
gentleman
is
not
to
be
admitted
to
see
me
oh
dear
oh
dear
have
i
done
anything
to
deserve
it
was
ever
so
monstrous
an
accusation
made
against
any
woman
if
it
were
not
for
my
boy
i
would
defy
him
to
do
his
worst
on
the
day
following
nora
again
became
a
messenger
between
the
husband
and
wife
and
before
a
reconciliation
had
been
effected
of
course
the
wife
gave
way
at
last
and
of
course
she
gave
way
so
cunningly
that
the
husband
received
none
of
the
gratification
which
he
had
expected
in
her
surrender
tell
him
to
come
nora
had
urged
of
course
he
can
come
if
he
pleases
emily
had
replied
then
nora
had
told
louis
to
come
and
louis
had
demanded
whether
if
he
did
so
the
promise
which
he
had
exacted
would
be
given
it
is
to
be
feared
that
nora
perverted
the
truth
a
little
but
if
ever
such
perversion
may
be
forgiven
forgiveness
was
due
to
her
if
they
could
only
be
brought
together
she
was
sure
that
there
would
be
a
reconciliation
they
were
brought
together
and
there
was
a
reconciliation
dearest
emily
i
am
so
glad
to
come
to
you
said
the
husband
walking
up
to
his
wife
in
their
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
illustration
shewing
how
reconciliation
was
made
i
have
been
very
unhappy
louis
for
the
last
two
days
said
she
very
gravely
returning
his
kiss
but
returning
it
somewhat
coldly
we
have
both
been
unhappy
i
am
sure
said
he
then
he
paused
that
the
promise
might
be
made
to
him
he
had
certainly
understood
that
it
was
to
be
made
without
reserve
as
an
act
on
her
part
which
she
had
fully
consented
to
perform
but
she
stood
silent
with
one
hand
on
the
looking
away
from
him
very
beautiful
and
dignified
too
in
her
manner
but
not
as
far
as
he
could
judge
either
repentant
or
submissive
nora
said
that
you
would
make
me
the
promise
which
i
ask
from
you
i
can
not
think
louis
how
you
can
want
such
a
promise
from
me
i
think
it
right
to
ask
it
i
do
indeed
can
you
imagine
that
i
shall
ever
willingly
see
this
gentleman
again
after
what
has
occurred
it
will
be
for
you
to
tell
the
servant
i
do
not
know
how
i
can
do
that
but
as
a
matter
of
course
i
will
encourage
no
person
to
come
to
your
house
of
whom
you
disapprove
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
of
any
man
or
of
any
woman
that
is
all
that
i
ask
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
have
thought
it
necessary
to
make
any
formal
request
in
the
matter
your
word
was
quite
sufficient
that
you
should
find
cause
of
complaint
in
colonel
osborne
coming
here
is
of
course
a
different
thing
quite
a
different
thing
said
he
i
can
not
pretend
to
understand
either
your
motives
or
your
fears
i
do
not
understand
them
my
own
prevents
me
from
supposing
it
to
be
possible
that
you
have
attributed
an
evil
thought
to
me
indeed
indeed
i
never
have
said
the
husband
that
i
can
assure
you
i
regard
as
a
matter
of
course
said
the
wife
but
you
know
emily
the
way
in
which
the
world
talks
the
world
and
do
you
regard
the
world
louis
lady
milborough
i
believe
spoke
to
yourself
lady
milborough
no
she
did
not
speak
to
me
she
began
to
do
so
but
i
was
careful
to
silence
her
at
once
from
you
louis
i
am
bound
to
hear
whatever
you
may
choose
to
say
to
me
but
i
will
not
hear
from
any
other
lips
a
single
word
that
may
be
injurious
to
your
honour
this
she
said
very
quietly
with
much
dignity
and
he
felt
that
he
had
better
not
answer
her
she
had
given
him
the
promise
which
he
had
demanded
and
he
began
to
fear
that
if
he
pushed
the
matter
further
she
might
go
back
even
from
that
amount
of
submission
so
he
kissed
her
again
and
had
the
boy
brought
into
the
room
and
by
the
time
that
he
went
to
dress
for
dinner
he
was
able
at
any
rate
to
seem
to
be
well
pleased
richard
he
said
to
the
servant
as
soon
as
he
was
when
colonel
osborne
calls
again
say
that
your
mistress
is
not
at
home
he
gave
the
order
in
the
most
indifferent
tone
of
voice
which
he
could
assume
but
as
he
gave
it
he
felt
thoroughly
ashamed
of
it
richard
who
with
the
other
servants
had
of
course
known
that
there
had
been
a
quarrel
between
his
master
and
mistress
for
the
last
two
days
no
doubt
understood
all
about
it
while
they
were
sitting
at
dinner
on
the
next
day
a
saturday
there
came
another
note
from
colonel
osborne
the
servant
brought
it
to
his
mistress
and
she
when
she
had
looked
at
it
put
it
down
by
her
plate
trevelyan
knew
immediately
from
whom
the
letter
had
come
and
understood
how
impossible
it
was
for
his
wife
to
give
it
up
in
the
servant
presence
the
letter
lay
there
till
the
man
was
out
of
the
room
and
then
she
handed
it
to
nora
will
you
give
that
to
louis
she
said
it
comes
from
the
man
whom
he
supposes
to
be
my
lover
emily
said
he
jumping
from
his
seat
how
can
you
allow
words
so
horrible
and
so
untrue
to
fall
from
your
mouth
if
it
be
not
so
why
am
i
to
be
placed
in
such
a
position
as
this
the
servant
knows
of
course
from
whom
the
letter
comes
and
sees
that
i
have
been
forbidden
to
open
it
then
the
man
returned
to
the
room
and
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
passed
off
almost
in
silence
it
was
their
custom
when
they
dined
without
company
to
leave
the
together
but
on
this
evening
trevelyan
remained
for
a
few
minutes
that
he
might
read
colonel
osborne
letter
he
waited
standing
on
the
rug
with
his
face
to
the
till
he
was
quite
alone
and
then
he
opened
it
it
ran
as
follows
house
of
commons
saturday
dear
emily
trevelyan
as
he
read
this
cursed
colonel
osborne
between
his
teeth
dear
emily
i
called
this
afternoon
but
you
were
out
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
disappointed
by
what
i
have
to
tell
you
but
you
should
rather
be
glad
of
it
they
say
at
the
that
sir
marmaduke
would
not
receive
their
letter
if
sent
now
till
the
middle
of
june
and
that
he
could
not
be
in
london
let
him
do
what
he
would
till
the
end
of
july
they
hope
to
have
the
session
over
by
that
time
and
therefore
the
committee
is
to
be
put
off
till
next
session
they
mean
to
have
lord
bowles
home
from
canada
and
they
think
that
bowles
would
like
to
be
here
in
the
winter
sir
marmaduke
will
be
summoned
for
february
next
and
will
of
course
stretch
his
stay
over
the
hot
months
all
this
will
on
the
whole
be
for
the
best
lady
rowley
could
hardly
have
packed
up
her
things
and
come
away
at
a
day
notice
whatever
your
father
might
have
done
call
at
luncheon
time
yours
always
o
there
was
nothing
objectionable
in
this
letter
excepting
always
the
dear
emily
nothing
which
it
was
not
imperative
on
colonel
osborne
to
communicate
to
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
trevelyan
must
now
go
and
tell
the
contents
of
the
letter
to
his
wife
but
he
felt
that
he
had
created
for
himself
a
terrible
trouble
he
must
tell
his
wife
what
was
in
the
letter
but
the
very
telling
of
it
would
be
a
renewing
of
the
soreness
of
his
wound
and
then
what
was
to
be
done
in
reference
to
the
threatened
visit
for
the
sunday
morning
trevelyan
knew
very
well
that
were
his
wife
denied
at
that
hour
colonel
osborne
would
understand
the
whole
matter
he
had
doubtless
in
his
anger
intended
that
colonel
osborne
should
understand
the
whole
matter
but
he
was
calmer
now
than
he
had
been
then
and
almost
wished
that
the
command
given
by
him
had
not
been
so
definite
and
imperious
he
remained
with
his
arm
on
the
thinking
of
it
for
some
ten
minutes
and
then
went
up
into
the
emily
he
said
walking
up
to
the
table
at
which
she
was
sitting
you
had
better
read
that
letter
i
would
so
much
rather
not
she
replied
haughtily
then
nora
can
read
it
it
concerns
you
both
equally
nora
with
hesitating
hand
took
the
letter
and
read
it
they
are
not
to
come
after
all
said
she
till
next
february
and
why
not
asked
trevelyan
something
about
the
session
i
do
quite
understand
lord
bowles
is
to
come
from
canada
said
louis
and
they
think
he
would
prefer
being
here
in
the
winter
i
dare
say
he
would
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
papa
i
suppose
they
must
both
be
here
together
said
nora
i
call
that
very
hard
indeed
said
trevelyan
i
ca
agree
with
you
there
said
her
husband
his
coming
at
all
is
so
much
of
a
favour
that
it
is
almost
a
job
i
do
see
that
it
is
a
job
at
all
said
trevelyan
somebody
is
wanted
and
nobody
can
know
more
of
the
service
than
papa
does
but
as
the
other
man
is
a
lord
i
suppose
papa
must
give
way
does
he
say
anything
about
mamma
nora
you
had
better
read
the
letter
yourself
said
trevelyan
who
was
desirous
that
his
wife
should
know
of
the
threatened
visit
no
louis
i
shall
not
do
that
you
must
not
blow
hot
and
cold
too
till
the
other
day
i
should
have
thought
that
colonel
letters
were
as
innocent
as
an
old
newspaper
as
you
have
supposed
them
to
be
poisoned
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
this
speech
made
him
very
angry
it
seemed
that
his
wife
who
had
yielded
to
him
was
determined
to
take
out
the
value
of
her
submission
in
the
most
disagreeable
words
which
she
could
utter
nora
now
closed
the
letter
and
handed
it
back
to
her
he
laid
it
down
on
the
table
beside
him
and
sat
for
a
while
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
book
at
last
he
spoke
again
colonel
osborne
says
that
he
will
call
at
luncheon
time
you
can
admit
him
if
you
please
and
thank
him
for
the
trouble
he
has
taken
in
this
matter
i
shall
not
remain
in
the
room
if
he
be
admitted
said
trevelyan
there
was
silence
again
for
some
minutes
and
the
cloud
upon
trevelyan
brow
became
blacker
than
before
then
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
round
to
the
sofa
on
which
his
wife
was
sitting
i
presume
said
he
that
your
wishes
and
mine
in
this
matter
must
be
the
same
i
can
not
tell
what
your
wishes
are
she
replied
i
never
was
more
in
the
dark
on
any
subject
in
my
life
my
wishes
at
present
are
confined
to
a
desire
to
save
you
as
far
as
may
be
possible
from
the
shame
which
must
be
attached
to
your
own
suspicions
i
have
never
had
any
suspicions
a
husband
without
suspicions
does
not
intercept
his
wife
letters
a
husband
without
suspicions
does
not
call
in
the
aid
of
his
servants
to
guard
his
wife
a
husband
without
suspicions
emily
exclaimed
nora
rowley
how
can
you
say
such
things
on
purpose
to
provoke
him
yes
on
purpose
to
provoke
me
said
trevelyan
and
have
i
not
been
provoked
have
i
not
been
injured
you
say
now
that
you
have
not
suspected
me
and
yet
in
what
condition
do
i
find
myself
because
an
old
woman
has
chosen
to
talk
scandal
about
me
i
am
placed
in
a
position
in
my
own
house
which
is
disgraceful
to
you
and
insupportable
to
myself
this
man
has
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
on
sundays
and
will
of
course
know
that
we
are
at
home
you
must
manage
it
as
you
please
if
you
choose
to
receive
him
i
will
go
why
ca
you
let
him
come
in
and
go
away
just
as
usual
said
nora
because
louis
has
made
me
promise
that
i
will
never
willingly
be
in
his
company
again
said
trevelyan
i
would
have
given
the
world
to
avoid
a
promise
so
disgraceful
to
me
but
it
was
exacted
and
it
shall
be
kept
having
so
spoken
she
swept
out
of
the
room
and
went
to
the
nursery
trevelyan
sat
for
an
hour
with
his
book
before
him
reading
or
pretending
to
read
but
his
wife
did
not
come
then
nora
went
up
to
her
and
he
descended
to
his
solitude
below
so
far
he
had
hardly
gained
much
by
the
enforced
obedience
of
his
wife
on
the
next
morning
the
three
went
to
church
together
and
as
they
were
walking
home
trevelyan
heart
was
filled
with
returning
gentleness
towards
his
wife
he
could
not
bear
to
be
at
wrath
with
her
after
the
church
service
which
they
had
just
heard
together
but
he
was
than
was
she
and
knowing
this
was
almost
afraid
to
say
anything
that
would
again
bring
forth
from
her
expressions
of
scorn
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
within
the
house
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
apart
let
all
this
be
said
he
as
though
it
had
never
been
that
will
hardly
be
possible
louis
she
answered
i
can
not
forget
that
i
have
been
cautioned
but
can
not
you
bring
yourself
to
believe
that
i
have
meant
it
all
for
your
good
i
have
never
doubted
it
louis
never
for
a
moment
but
it
has
hurt
me
to
find
that
you
should
think
that
such
caution
was
needed
for
my
good
it
was
almost
on
his
tongue
to
beg
her
pardon
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
to
implore
her
to
forget
that
he
had
ever
made
an
objection
to
colonel
osborne
visit
he
remembered
at
this
moment
the
painful
odiousness
of
that
dear
emily
but
he
had
to
reconcile
himself
even
to
that
telling
himself
that
after
all
colonel
osborne
was
an
old
man
a
man
older
even
than
his
father
if
she
would
only
have
met
him
with
gentleness
he
would
have
withdrawn
his
command
and
have
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
wrong
but
she
was
hard
dignified
obedient
and
resentful
it
will
i
think
he
said
be
better
for
both
of
us
that
he
should
be
asked
in
to
lunch
you
must
judge
of
that
said
emily
perhaps
upon
the
whole
it
will
be
best
i
can
only
say
that
i
will
not
be
present
i
will
lunch
with
baby
and
you
can
make
what
excuse
for
me
you
please
this
was
all
very
bad
but
it
was
in
this
way
that
things
were
allowed
to
arrange
themselves
richard
was
told
that
colonel
osborne
was
coming
to
lunch
and
when
he
came
something
was
muttered
to
him
about
trevelyan
being
not
quite
well
it
was
nora
who
told
the
innocent
fib
and
though
she
did
not
tell
it
well
she
did
her
very
best
she
felt
that
her
was
very
wretched
and
she
was
most
anxious
to
relieve
him
colonel
osborne
did
not
stay
long
and
then
nora
went
to
her
sister
louis
trevelyan
felt
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
he
had
meant
to
have
been
strong
and
he
had
as
he
knew
been
very
weak
he
had
meant
to
have
acted
in
a
honest
manly
manner
but
circumstances
had
been
so
untoward
with
him
that
on
looking
at
his
own
conduct
it
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
mean
and
almost
false
and
cowardly
as
the
order
for
the
exclusion
of
this
hated
man
from
his
house
had
been
given
he
should
at
any
rate
have
stuck
to
the
order
at
the
moment
of
his
vacillation
he
had
simply
intended
to
make
things
easy
for
his
wife
but
she
had
taken
advantage
of
his
vacillation
and
had
now
clearly
conquered
him
perhaps
he
respected
her
more
than
he
had
done
when
he
was
resolving
three
or
four
days
since
that
he
would
be
the
master
in
his
own
house
but
it
may
be
feared
that
the
tenderness
of
his
love
for
her
had
been
impaired
late
in
the
afternoon
his
wife
and
came
down
dressed
for
walking
and
finding
trevelyan
in
the
library
they
asked
him
to
join
them
it
was
a
custom
with
them
to
walk
in
the
park
on
a
sunday
afternoon
and
he
at
once
assented
and
went
out
with
them
emily
who
had
had
her
triumph
was
very
gracious
there
should
not
be
a
word
more
said
by
her
about
colonel
osborne
she
would
avoid
that
gentleman
never
receiving
him
in
curzon
street
and
having
as
little
to
say
to
him
as
possible
elsewhere
but
she
would
not
throw
his
name
in
her
husband
teeth
or
make
any
reference
to
the
injury
which
had
so
manifestly
been
done
to
her
unless
louis
should
be
indiscreet
it
should
be
as
though
it
had
been
forgotten
as
they
walked
by
chesterfield
house
and
stanhope
street
into
the
park
she
began
to
discuss
the
sermon
they
had
heard
that
morning
and
when
she
found
that
that
subject
was
not
alluring
she
spoke
of
a
dinner
to
which
they
were
to
go
at
fairfax
house
louis
trevelyan
was
quite
aware
that
he
was
being
treated
as
a
naughty
boy
who
was
to
be
forgiven
they
went
across
hyde
park
into
kensington
gardens
and
still
the
same
thing
was
going
on
nora
found
it
to
be
almost
impossible
to
say
a
word
trevelyan
answered
his
wife
questions
but
was
otherwise
silent
emily
worked
very
hard
at
her
mission
of
forgiveness
and
hardly
ceased
in
her
efforts
at
conciliatory
conversation
women
can
work
so
much
harder
in
this
way
than
men
find
it
possible
to
do
she
never
flagged
but
continued
to
be
fluent
conciliatory
and
intolerably
wearisome
on
a
sudden
they
came
across
two
men
together
who
as
they
all
knew
were
barely
acquainted
with
each
other
these
were
colonel
osborne
and
hugh
stanbury
i
am
glad
to
find
you
are
able
to
be
out
said
the
colonel
thanks
yes
i
think
my
seclusion
just
now
was
almost
as
much
due
to
baby
as
to
anything
else
stanbury
how
is
it
we
never
see
you
now
it
is
the
trevelyan
nothing
else
the
is
a
most
grateful
mistress
but
somewhat
exacting
i
am
allowed
a
couple
of
hours
on
sundays
but
otherwise
my
time
is
wholly
passed
in
fleet
street
how
very
unpleasant
well
yes
the
unpleasantness
of
this
world
consists
chiefly
in
the
fact
that
when
a
man
wants
wages
he
must
earn
them
the
christian
philosophers
have
a
theory
about
it
do
they
call
it
the
primeval
fall
original
sin
and
that
kind
of
thing
stanbury
i
wo
have
irreligion
i
hope
that
does
come
from
writing
for
the
newspapers
certainly
not
with
me
trevelyan
i
have
never
been
put
on
to
take
that
branch
yet
scrubby
does
that
with
us
and
does
it
excellently
it
was
he
who
touched
up
the
ritualists
and
then
the
commission
and
then
the
low
church
bishops
till
he
did
leave
one
of
them
a
leg
to
stand
upon
what
is
it
then
that
the
daily
record
upholds
it
upholds
the
daily
record
believe
in
that
and
you
will
surely
be
saved
then
he
turned
to
miss
rowley
and
they
two
were
soon
walking
on
together
each
manifestly
interested
in
what
the
other
was
saying
though
there
was
no
word
of
tenderness
spoken
between
them
colonel
osborne
was
now
between
and
trevelyan
she
would
have
avoided
the
position
had
it
been
possible
for
her
to
do
so
while
they
were
falling
into
their
present
places
she
had
made
a
little
mute
appeal
to
her
husband
to
take
her
away
from
the
spot
to
give
her
his
arm
and
return
with
her
to
save
her
in
some
way
from
remaining
in
company
with
the
man
to
whose
company
for
her
he
had
objected
but
he
took
no
such
step
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
take
no
such
step
without
showing
his
hostility
to
colonel
osborne
they
walked
on
along
the
broad
path
together
and
the
colonel
was
between
them
i
hope
you
think
it
satisfactory
about
sir
rowley
he
said
beggars
must
not
be
choosers
you
know
colonel
osborne
i
felt
a
little
disappointed
when
i
found
that
we
were
not
to
see
them
till
february
next
they
will
stay
longer
then
you
know
than
they
could
now
i
have
no
doubt
when
the
time
comes
we
shall
all
believe
it
to
be
better
i
suppose
you
think
emily
that
a
little
pudding
is
better
than
much
colonel
osborne
certainly
had
a
caressing
affectionate
mode
of
talking
to
women
which
unless
it
were
reciprocated
and
enjoyed
was
likely
to
make
itself
disagreeable
no
possible
words
could
have
been
more
innocent
than
those
he
had
now
spoken
but
he
had
turned
his
face
down
close
to
her
face
and
had
almost
whispered
them
and
then
too
he
had
again
called
her
by
her
christian
name
trevelyan
had
not
heard
the
words
he
had
walked
on
making
the
distance
between
him
and
the
other
man
greater
than
was
necessary
anxious
to
show
to
his
wife
that
he
had
no
jealousy
at
such
a
meeting
as
this
but
his
wife
was
determined
that
she
would
put
an
end
to
this
state
of
things
let
the
cost
be
what
it
might
she
did
not
say
a
word
to
colonel
osborne
but
addressed
herself
at
once
to
her
husband
louis
she
said
will
you
give
me
your
arm
we
will
go
back
if
you
please
then
she
took
her
husband
arm
and
turned
herself
and
him
abruptly
away
from
their
companion
the
thing
was
done
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
impossible
that
colonel
osborne
should
not
perceive
that
he
had
been
left
in
anger
when
trevelyan
and
his
wife
had
gone
back
a
few
yards
he
was
obliged
to
return
for
nora
he
did
so
and
then
rejoined
his
wife
it
was
quite
unnecessary
emily
he
said
that
you
should
behave
like
that
your
suspicions
she
said
have
made
it
almost
impossible
for
me
to
behave
with
propriety
you
have
told
him
everything
now
said
trevelyan
and
it
was
requisite
that
he
should
be
told
said
his
wife
then
they
walked
home
without
interchanging
another
word
when
they
reached
their
house
emily
at
once
went
up
to
her
own
room
and
trevelyan
to
his
they
parted
as
though
they
had
no
common
interest
which
was
worthy
of
a
moment
conversation
and
she
by
her
step
and
gait
and
every
movement
of
her
body
showed
to
him
that
she
was
not
his
wife
now
in
any
sense
that
could
bring
to
him
a
feeling
of
domestic
happiness
her
compliance
with
his
command
was
of
no
use
to
him
unless
she
could
be
brought
to
comply
in
spirit
unless
she
would
be
soft
to
him
he
could
not
be
happy
he
walked
about
his
room
uneasily
for
trying
to
shake
off
his
sorrow
and
then
he
went
up
to
her
room
emily
he
said
for
god
sake
let
all
this
pass
away
what
is
to
pass
away
this
feeling
of
rancour
between
you
and
me
what
is
the
world
to
us
unless
we
can
love
one
another
at
any
rate
it
will
be
nothing
to
me
do
you
doubt
my
love
said
she
no
certainly
not
nor
i
yours
without
love
louis
you
and
i
can
not
be
happy
but
love
alone
will
not
make
us
so
there
must
be
trust
and
there
must
also
be
forbearance
my
feeling
of
annoyance
will
pass
away
in
time
and
till
it
does
i
will
shew
it
as
little
as
may
be
possible
he
felt
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
and
then
he
left
her
but
he
had
gained
nothing
by
the
interview
she
was
still
hard
and
cold
and
still
assumed
a
tone
which
seemed
to
imply
that
she
had
manifestly
been
the
injured
person
colonel
osborne
when
he
was
left
alone
stood
for
a
few
moments
on
the
spot
and
then
with
a
whistle
a
shake
of
the
head
and
a
little
low
chuckle
of
laughter
rejoined
the
crowd

illustration
miss
jemima
stanbury
the
aunt
of
our
friend
hugh
was
a
maiden
lady
very
much
respected
indeed
in
the
city
of
exeter
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
no
readers
of
these
pages
will
be
so
as
to
be
unable
to
appreciate
the
difference
between
county
society
and
town
society
the
society
that
is
of
a
provincial
town
or
so
ignorant
as
not
to
know
also
that
there
may
be
persons
so
privileged
that
although
they
live
distinctly
within
a
provincial
town
there
is
accorded
to
them
as
though
by
brevet
rank
all
the
merit
of
living
in
the
county
in
reference
to
persons
so
privileged
it
is
considered
that
they
have
been
made
free
from
the
contamination
of
contiguous
bricks
and
mortar
by
certain
inner
gifts
probably
of
birth
occasionally
of
profession
possibly
of
merit
it
is
very
rarely
indeed
that
money
alone
will
bestow
this
acknowledged
rank
and
in
exeter
which
by
the
stringency
and
excellence
of
its
rules
on
such
matters
may
perhaps
be
said
to
take
the
lead
of
all
english
provincial
towns
money
alone
has
never
availed
good
blood
especially
if
it
be
blood
good
in
devonshire
is
rarely
rejected
clergymen
are
allowed
within
the
pale
though
by
no
means
as
certainly
as
used
to
be
the
case
and
indeed
in
these
days
of
literates
clergymen
have
to
pass
harder
examinations
than
those
ever
imposed
upon
them
by
bishops
chaplains
before
they
are
admitted
ad
eundem
among
the
chosen
ones
of
the
city
of
exeter
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
old
prebendaries
see
well
to
that
and
as
has
been
said
special
merit
may
prevail
sir
peter
mancrudy
the
great
exeter
physician
has
won
his
way
in
not
at
all
by
being
sir
peter
which
has
stood
in
his
way
rather
than
otherwise
but
by
the
acknowledged
excellence
of
his
book
about
saltzes
sir
peter
mancrudy
is
supposed
to
have
quite
a
metropolitan
almost
a
european
reputation
and
therefore
is
acknowledged
to
belong
to
the
county
set
although
he
never
dines
out
at
any
house
beyond
the
limits
of
the
city
now
let
it
be
known
that
no
inhabitant
of
exeter
ever
achieved
a
clearer
right
to
be
regarded
as
county
in
opposition
to
town
than
had
miss
jemima
stanbury
there
was
not
a
tradesman
in
exeter
who
was
not
aware
of
it
and
who
did
not
touch
his
hat
to
her
accordingly
the
men
who
drove
the
flies
when
summoned
to
take
her
out
at
night
would
bring
oats
with
them
knowing
how
probable
it
was
that
they
might
have
to
travel
far
a
distinct
apology
was
made
if
she
was
asked
to
drink
tea
with
people
who
were
simply
town
the
noels
of
doddescombe
leigh
the
cliffords
of
budleigh
salterton
the
powels
of
haldon
the
cheritons
of
alphington
all
county
persons
but
very
frequently
in
the
city
were
greeted
by
her
and
greeted
her
on
terms
of
equality
her
most
intimate
friend
was
old
machugh
the
widow
of
the
last
dean
but
two
who
could
not
have
stood
higher
had
she
been
the
widow
of
the
last
bishop
and
then
although
miss
stanbury
was
intimate
with
the
frenches
of
heavitree
with
the
wrights
of
northernhay
with
the
apjohns
of
helion
villa
a
really
magnificent
house
two
miles
out
of
the
city
on
the
crediton
road
and
with
the
crumbies
of
cronstadt
house
saint
ide
who
would
have
been
county
people
if
living
in
the
country
made
the
difference
although
she
was
intimate
with
all
these
families
her
manner
to
them
was
not
the
same
nor
was
it
expected
to
be
the
same
as
with
those
of
her
own
acknowledged
set
these
things
are
understood
in
exeter
so
well
miss
stanbury
belonged
to
the
county
set
but
she
lived
in
a
large
brick
house
standing
in
the
close
almost
behind
the
cathedral
indeed
it
was
so
close
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
edifice
that
a
carriage
could
not
be
brought
quite
up
to
her
door
it
was
a
large
brick
house
very
old
with
a
door
in
the
middle
and
five
steps
ascending
to
it
between
high
iron
rails
on
each
side
of
the
door
there
were
two
windows
on
the
ground
floor
and
above
that
there
were
three
tiers
of
five
windows
each
and
the
house
was
double
throughout
having
as
many
windows
looking
out
behind
into
a
gloomy
courtyard
but
the
glory
of
the
house
consisted
in
this
that
there
was
a
garden
attached
to
it
a
garden
with
very
high
walls
over
which
the
boughs
of
trees
might
be
seen
giving
to
the
otherwise
gloomy
abode
a
touch
of
freshness
in
the
summer
and
a
look
of
space
in
the
winter
which
no
doubt
added
something
to
the
reputation
even
of
miss
stanbury
the
fact
for
it
was
a
fact
that
there
was
no
gloomier
or
less
attractive
spot
in
the
whole
city
than
miss
stanbury
garden
when
seen
inside
did
not
militate
against
this
advantage
there
were
but
trees
and
a
few
square
yards
of
grass
that
was
never
green
and
a
damp
ungravelled
path
on
which
no
one
ever
walked
seen
from
the
inside
the
garden
was
not
much
but
from
the
outside
it
gave
a
distinct
character
to
the
house
and
produced
an
unexpressed
acknowledgment
that
the
owner
of
it
ought
to
belong
to
the
county
set
the
house
and
all
that
was
in
it
belonged
to
miss
stanbury
herself
as
did
also
many
other
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
she
was
the
owner
of
the
cock
and
bottle
a
very
decent
second
class
inn
on
the
other
side
of
the
close
an
inn
supposed
to
have
clerical
tendencies
which
made
it
quite
suitable
for
a
close
the
choristers
took
their
beer
there
and
the
landlord
was
a
retired
verger
nearly
the
whole
of
one
side
of
a
dark
passage
leading
out
of
the
close
towards
the
high
street
belonged
to
her
and
though
the
passage
be
narrow
and
the
houses
dark
the
locality
is
known
to
be
good
for
trade
and
she
owned
two
large
houses
in
the
high
street
and
a
great
warehouse
at
thomas
and
had
been
bought
out
of
land
by
the
railway
at
david
much
to
her
own
dissatisfaction
as
she
was
wont
to
express
herself
but
undoubtedly
at
a
very
high
price
it
will
be
understood
therefore
that
miss
stanbury
was
wealthy
and
that
she
was
bound
to
the
city
in
which
she
lived
by
peculiar
ties
but
miss
stanbury
had
not
been
born
to
this
wealth
nor
can
she
be
said
to
have
inherited
from
her
forefathers
any
of
these
high
privileges
which
had
been
awarded
to
her
she
had
achieved
them
by
the
romance
of
her
life
and
the
manner
in
which
she
had
carried
herself
amidst
its
vicissitudes
her
father
had
been
vicar
of
nuncombe
putney
a
parish
lying
twenty
miles
west
of
exeter
among
the
moors
and
on
her
father
death
her
brother
also
now
dead
had
become
vicar
of
the
same
parish
her
brother
whose
only
son
hugh
stanbury
we
already
know
working
for
the
up
in
london
when
miss
stanbury
was
she
became
engaged
to
a
certain
brooke
burgess
the
eldest
son
of
a
banker
in
exeter
or
it
might
perhaps
be
better
said
a
banker
himself
for
at
the
time
brooke
burgess
was
in
the
firm
it
need
not
here
be
told
how
various
misfortunes
arose
how
burgess
quarrelled
with
the
stanbury
family
how
jemima
quarrelled
with
her
own
family
how
when
her
father
died
she
went
out
from
nuncombe
putney
parsonage
and
lived
on
the
smallest
pittance
in
a
city
lodging
how
her
lover
was
untrue
to
her
and
did
not
marry
her
and
how
at
last
he
died
and
left
her
every
shilling
that
he
possessed
the
devonshire
people
at
the
time
had
been
much
divided
as
to
the
merits
of
the
stanbury
quarrel
there
were
many
who
said
that
the
brother
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
than
he
did
and
that
miss
stanbury
though
by
force
of
character
and
force
of
circumstances
she
had
weathered
the
storm
had
in
truth
been
very
indiscreet
the
results
however
were
as
have
been
described
at
the
period
of
which
we
treat
miss
stanbury
was
a
very
rich
lady
living
by
herself
in
exeter
admitted
without
question
to
be
one
of
the
county
set
and
still
at
variance
with
her
brother
family
except
to
hugh
she
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
one
of
them
since
her
brother
death
when
the
money
came
into
her
hands
she
at
that
time
being
over
forty
and
her
nephew
being
then
just
ten
years
old
she
had
undertaken
to
educate
him
and
to
start
him
in
the
world
we
know
how
she
had
kept
her
word
and
how
and
why
she
had
withdrawn
herself
from
any
further
responsibility
in
the
matter
and
in
regard
to
this
business
of
starting
the
young
man
she
had
been
careful
to
let
it
be
known
that
she
would
do
no
more
than
start
him
in
the
formal
document
by
means
of
which
she
had
made
the
proposal
to
her
brother
she
had
been
careful
to
let
it
be
understood
that
simple
education
was
all
that
she
intended
to
bestow
upon
him
and
that
only
she
had
added
in
the
event
of
my
surviving
till
his
education
be
completed
and
to
hugh
himself
she
had
declared
that
any
allowance
which
she
made
him
after
he
was
called
to
the
bar
was
only
made
in
order
to
give
him
room
for
his
foot
a
spot
of
ground
from
whence
to
make
his
first
leap
we
know
how
he
made
that
leap
infinitely
to
the
disgust
of
his
aunt
who
when
he
refused
obedience
to
her
in
the
matter
of
withdrawing
from
the
daily
record
immediately
withdrew
from
him
not
only
her
patronage
and
assistance
but
even
her
friendship
and
acquaintance
this
was
the
letter
which
she
wrote
to
him
i
do
think
that
writing
radical
stuff
for
a
penny
newspaper
is
a
respectable
occupation
for
a
gentleman
and
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
you
choose
to
do
such
work
i
can
not
help
it
but
it
was
not
for
such
that
i
sent
you
to
harrow
and
oxford
nor
yet
up
to
london
and
paid
a
year
to
lambert
i
think
you
are
treating
me
badly
but
that
is
nothing
to
your
bad
treatment
of
yourself
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
answer
this
unless
you
are
prepared
to
say
that
you
will
not
write
any
more
stuff
for
that
penny
newspaper
only
i
wish
to
be
understood
i
will
have
no
connection
that
i
can
help
and
no
acquaintance
at
all
with
radical
scribblers
and
incendiaries
jemima
stanbury
the
close
exeter
april
hugh
stanbury
had
answered
this
thanking
his
aunt
for
past
favours
and
explaining
to
her
or
striving
to
do
so
that
he
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
earn
his
bread
as
a
means
of
earning
it
had
come
within
his
reach
he
might
as
well
have
spared
himself
the
trouble
she
simply
wrote
a
few
words
across
his
own
letter
in
red
ink
the
bread
of
unworthiness
should
never
be
earned
or
eaten
and
then
sent
the
letter
back
under
a
blank
envelope
to
her
nephew
she
was
a
thorough
tory
of
the
old
school
had
hugh
taken
to
writing
for
a
newspaper
that
had
cost
sixpence
or
even
threepence
for
its
copies
she
might
perhaps
have
forgiven
him
at
any
rate
the
offence
would
not
have
been
so
flagrant
and
had
the
paper
been
conservative
instead
of
liberal
she
would
have
had
some
qualms
of
conscience
before
she
gave
him
up
but
to
live
by
writing
for
a
newspaper
and
for
a
penny
newspaper
and
for
a
penny
radical
newspaper
it
was
more
than
she
could
endure
of
what
nature
were
the
articles
which
he
contributed
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
have
any
idea
for
no
consideration
would
have
induced
her
to
look
at
a
penny
newspaper
or
to
admit
it
within
her
doors
she
herself
took
in
the
john
bull
and
the
herald
and
daily
groaned
deeply
at
the
way
in
which
those
once
great
organs
of
true
british
public
feeling
were
becoming
demoralised
and
perverted
had
any
reduction
been
made
in
the
price
of
either
of
them
she
would
at
once
have
stopped
her
subscription
in
the
matter
of
politics
she
had
long
since
come
to
think
that
everything
good
was
over
she
hated
the
name
of
reform
so
much
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
in
disraeli
and
his
bill
for
many
years
she
had
believed
in
lord
derby
she
would
fain
believe
in
him
still
if
she
could
it
was
the
great
desire
of
her
heart
to
have
some
one
in
whom
she
believed
in
the
bishop
of
her
diocese
she
did
believe
and
annually
sent
him
some
little
comforting
present
from
her
own
hand
and
in
two
or
three
of
the
clergymen
around
her
she
believed
finding
in
them
a
flavour
of
the
unascetic
godliness
of
ancient
days
which
was
gratifying
to
her
palate
but
in
politics
there
was
hardly
a
name
remaining
to
which
she
could
fix
her
faith
and
declare
that
there
should
be
her
guide
for
awhile
she
thought
she
would
cling
to
lowe
but
when
she
made
inquiry
she
found
that
there
was
no
base
there
of
really
conservative
granite
the
three
gentlemen
who
had
dissevered
themselves
from
disraeli
when
disraeli
was
passing
his
reform
bill
were
doubtless
very
good
in
their
way
but
they
were
not
big
enough
to
fill
her
heart
she
tried
to
make
herself
happy
with
general
peel
but
general
peel
was
after
all
no
more
than
a
shade
to
her
but
the
untruth
of
others
never
made
her
untrue
and
she
still
talked
of
the
excellence
of
george
iii
and
the
glories
of
the
subsequent
reign
she
had
a
bust
of
lord
eldon
before
which
she
was
accustomed
to
stand
with
hands
closed
and
to
weep
or
to
think
that
she
wept
she
was
a
little
woman
now
nearly
sixty
years
of
age
with
bright
grey
eyes
and
a
strong
roman
nose
and
thin
lips
and
a
chin
she
wore
a
that
almost
amounted
to
a
and
beneath
it
her
grey
hair
was
always
frizzled
with
the
greatest
care
her
dress
was
invariably
of
black
silk
and
she
had
five
gowns
one
for
church
one
for
evening
parties
one
for
driving
out
and
one
for
evenings
at
home
and
one
for
mornings
the
dress
when
new
always
went
to
church
nothing
she
was
wont
to
say
was
too
good
for
the
lord
house
in
the
days
of
crinolines
she
had
protested
that
she
had
never
worn
one
a
protest
however
which
was
hardly
true
and
now
in
these
later
days
her
hatred
was
especially
developed
in
reference
to
the
of
young
women
chignon
was
a
word
which
she
had
never
been
heard
to
pronounce
she
would
talk
of
those
bandboxes
which
the
sluts
wear
behind
their
noddles
for
miss
stanbury
allowed
herself
the
use
of
much
strong
language
she
was
very
punctilious
in
all
her
habits
breakfasting
ever
at
eight
and
dining
always
at
six
five
had
been
her
time
till
the
bishop
who
on
an
occasion
was
to
be
her
guest
once
signified
to
her
that
such
an
hour
cut
up
the
day
and
interfered
with
clerical
work
her
lunch
was
always
of
bread
and
cheese
and
they
who
lunched
with
her
either
eat
that
or
the
bread
without
the
cheese
an
afternoon
tea
was
a
thing
horrible
to
her
imagination
tea
and
buttered
toast
at
eight
in
the
evening
was
the
great
luxury
of
her
life
she
was
as
strong
as
a
horse
and
had
never
hitherto
known
a
day
illness
as
a
consequence
of
this
she
did
not
believe
in
the
illness
of
other
people
especially
not
in
the
illness
of
women
she
did
not
like
a
girl
who
could
not
drink
a
glass
of
beer
with
her
bread
and
cheese
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
she
thought
that
a
glass
of
port
after
dinner
was
good
for
everybody
indeed
she
had
a
thorough
belief
in
port
wine
thinking
that
it
would
go
far
to
cure
most
miseries
but
she
could
not
put
up
with
the
idea
that
a
woman
young
or
old
should
want
the
stimulus
of
a
glass
of
sherry
to
support
her
at
any
odd
time
of
the
day
hot
concoctions
of
strong
drink
at
christmas
she
would
allow
to
everybody
and
was
very
strong
in
recommending
such
comforts
to
ladies
blessed
or
about
to
be
blessed
with
babies
she
took
the
sacrament
every
month
and
gave
away
exactly
a
tenth
of
her
income
to
the
poor
she
believed
that
there
was
a
special
holiness
in
a
tithe
of
a
thing
and
attributed
the
commencement
of
the
downfall
of
the
church
of
england
to
rent
charges
and
the
commutation
of
clergymen
incomes
since
judas
there
had
never
been
to
her
thinking
a
traitor
so
base
or
an
apostate
so
sinful
as
colenso
and
yet
of
the
nature
of
teaching
she
was
as
ignorant
as
the
towers
of
the
cathedral
opposite
to
her
she
believed
in
exeter
thinking
that
there
was
no
other
provincial
town
in
england
in
which
a
maiden
lady
could
live
safely
and
decently
london
to
her
was
an
abode
of
sin
and
though
as
we
have
seen
she
delighted
to
call
herself
one
of
the
county
set
she
did
not
love
the
fields
and
lanes
and
in
exeter
the
only
place
for
a
lady
was
the
close
southernhay
and
northernhay
might
be
very
well
and
there
was
doubtless
a
respectable
neighbourhood
on
the
heavitree
side
of
the
town
but
for
the
new
streets
and
especially
for
the
suburban
villas
she
had
no
endurance
she
liked
to
deal
at
dear
shops
but
would
leave
any
shop
either
dear
or
cheap
in
regard
to
which
a
printed
advertisement
should
reach
her
eye
she
paid
all
her
bills
at
the
end
of
each
six
months
and
almost
took
a
delight
in
high
prices
she
would
rejoice
that
bread
should
be
cheap
and
grieve
that
meat
should
be
dear
because
of
the
poor
but
in
regard
to
other
matters
no
reduction
in
the
cost
of
an
article
ever
pleased
her
she
had
houses
as
to
which
she
was
told
by
her
agent
that
the
rents
should
be
raised
but
she
would
not
raise
them
she
had
others
which
it
was
difficult
to
let
without
lowering
the
rents
but
she
would
not
lower
them
all
change
was
to
her
hateful
and
unnecessary
she
kept
three
and
a
man
came
in
every
day
to
clean
the
knives
and
boots
service
with
her
was
well
requited
and
much
labour
was
never
exacted
but
it
was
not
every
young
woman
who
could
live
with
her
a
rigidity
as
to
hours
as
to
religious
exercises
and
as
to
dress
was
exacted
under
which
many
poor
girls
altogether
broke
down
but
they
who
could
stand
this
rigidity
came
to
know
that
their
places
were
very
valuable
no
one
belonging
to
them
need
want
for
aught
when
once
the
good
opinion
of
miss
stanbury
had
been
earned
when
once
she
believed
in
her
servant
there
was
nobody
like
that
servant
there
was
not
a
man
in
exeter
could
clean
a
boot
except
giles
hickbody
and
if
not
in
exeter
then
where
else
and
her
own
maid
martha
who
had
lived
with
her
now
for
twenty
years
and
who
had
come
with
her
to
the
brick
house
when
she
first
inhabited
it
was
such
a
woman
that
no
other
servant
anywhere
was
fit
to
hold
a
candle
to
her
but
then
martha
had
great
gifts
was
never
ill
and
really
liked
having
sermons
read
to
her
such
was
miss
stanbury
who
had
now
discarded
her
nephew
hugh
she
had
never
been
tenderly
affectionate
to
hugh
or
she
would
hardly
have
asked
him
to
live
in
london
on
a
hundred
a
year
she
had
never
really
been
kind
to
him
since
he
was
a
boy
for
although
she
had
paid
for
him
she
had
been
almost
penurious
in
her
manner
of
doing
so
and
had
repeatedly
given
him
to
understand
that
in
the
event
of
her
death
not
a
shilling
would
be
left
to
him
indeed
as
to
that
matter
of
bequeathing
her
money
it
was
understood
that
it
was
her
purpose
to
let
it
all
go
back
to
the
burgess
family
with
the
burgess
family
she
had
kept
up
no
sustained
connection
it
being
quite
understood
that
she
was
never
to
be
asked
to
meet
the
only
one
of
them
now
left
in
exeter
nor
was
it
as
yet
known
to
any
one
in
what
manner
the
money
was
to
go
back
how
it
was
to
be
divided
or
who
were
to
be
the
recipients
but
she
had
declared
that
it
should
go
back
explaining
that
she
had
conceived
it
to
be
a
duty
to
let
her
own
relations
know
that
they
would
not
inherit
her
wealth
at
her
death
about
a
week
after
she
had
sent
back
poor
hugh
letter
with
the
endorsement
on
it
as
to
unworthy
bread
she
summoned
martha
to
the
back
parlour
in
which
she
was
accustomed
to
write
her
letters
it
was
one
of
the
theories
of
her
life
that
different
rooms
should
be
used
only
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
intended
she
never
allowed
pens
and
ink
up
into
the
and
had
she
ever
heard
that
any
guest
in
her
house
was
reading
in
bed
she
would
have
made
an
instant
personal
attack
upon
that
guest
whether
male
or
female
which
would
have
surprised
that
guest
poor
hugh
would
have
got
on
better
with
her
had
he
not
been
discovered
once
smoking
in
the
garden
nor
would
she
have
writing
materials
in
the
or
there
was
a
chamber
behind
the
in
which
there
was
an
inkbottle
and
if
there
was
a
letter
to
be
written
let
the
writer
go
there
and
write
it
in
the
writing
of
many
letters
however
she
put
no
confidence
and
regarded
penny
postage
as
one
of
the
strongest
evidences
of
the
coming
ruin
martha
she
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
sit
down
i
think
i
am
going
to
do
something
martha
sat
down
but
did
not
speak
a
word
there
had
been
no
question
asked
of
her
and
the
time
for
speaking
had
not
come
i
am
writing
to
stanbury
at
nuncombe
putney
and
what
do
you
think
i
am
saying
to
her
now
the
question
had
been
asked
and
it
was
martha
duty
to
reply
writing
to
stanbury
yes
to
mrs
stanbury
it
ai
possible
for
me
to
say
unless
it
to
put
hugh
from
going
on
with
the
newspapers
when
my
nephew
wo
be
controlled
by
me
i
sha
go
elsewhere
to
look
for
control
over
him
you
may
be
sure
of
that
martha
and
remember
martha
i
do
want
to
have
his
name
mentioned
again
in
the
house
you
will
tell
them
all
so
if
you
please
he
was
a
very
nice
gentleman
martha
i
wo
have
it
and
there
an
end
of
it
i
wo
have
it
perhaps
i
know
what
goes
to
the
making
of
a
nice
gentleman
as
well
as
you
do
hugh
i
wo
have
it
martha
and
when
i
say
so
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
as
she
said
this
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
shook
her
head
and
took
a
turn
about
the
room
if
i
not
mistress
here
nobody
of
course
you
mistress
here
and
if
i
do
know
what
fit
to
be
done
and
what
not
fit
too
old
to
learn
and
what
more
i
wo
be
taught
i
not
going
to
have
my
house
crammed
with
radical
incendiary
stuff
printed
with
ink
that
stinks
on
paper
made
out
of
straw
if
i
ca
live
without
penny
literature
at
any
rate
i
die
without
it
now
listen
to
me
yes
i
have
asked
stanbury
to
send
one
of
the
girls
over
here
to
live
martha
tone
as
she
asked
the
question
showed
how
deeply
she
felt
its
importance
yes
martha
to
live
you
never
like
it
i
do
suppose
i
shall
you
never
get
on
with
it
never
the
young
lady
be
out
of
the
house
in
a
week
or
if
she
ai
somebody
else
will
you
mean
yourself
i
only
a
servant
and
it
do
signify
about
me
you
a
fool
that
true
i
do
doubt
i
sent
for
her
and
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
perhaps
she
come
she
come
fast
enough
said
martha
but
whether
she
stay
that
a
different
thing
i
do
see
how
it
possible
she
to
stay
i
told
they
feckless
idle
young
ladies
she
be
so
soft
and
you
well
what
of
me
you
be
so
hard
i
not
a
bit
harder
than
you
martha
nor
yet
so
hard
i
do
my
duty
or
at
least
i
try
now
you
know
all
about
it
and
you
may
go
away
there
the
letter
and
i
mean
to
go
out
and
post
it
myself
chapter
viii
i
know
it
will
do
miss
stanbury
carried
her
letter
all
the
way
to
the
chief
in
the
city
having
no
faith
whatever
in
those
little
subsidiary
receiving
houses
which
are
established
in
different
parts
of
the
city
as
for
the
iron
pillar
boxes
which
had
been
erected
of
late
years
for
the
receipt
of
letters
one
of
which
a
most
hateful
thing
to
her
stood
almost
close
to
her
own
hall
door
she
had
not
the
faintest
belief
that
any
letter
put
into
one
of
them
would
ever
reach
its
destination
she
could
not
understand
why
people
should
not
walk
with
their
letters
to
a
respectable
instead
of
chucking
them
into
an
iron
stump
as
she
called
it
out
in
the
middle
of
the
street
with
nobody
to
look
after
it
positive
orders
had
been
given
that
no
letter
from
her
house
should
ever
be
put
into
the
iron
post
her
epistle
to
her
of
whom
she
never
spoke
otherwise
than
as
stanbury
was
as
follows
the
close
exeter
april
my
dear
sister
stanbury
your
son
hugh
has
taken
to
courses
of
which
i
do
not
approve
and
therefore
i
have
put
an
end
to
my
connection
with
him
i
shall
be
happy
to
entertain
your
daughter
dorothy
in
my
house
if
you
and
she
approve
of
such
a
plan
should
you
agree
to
this
she
will
be
welcome
to
receive
you
or
her
sister
her
in
my
house
any
wednesday
morning
between
nine
and
twelve
i
will
endeavour
to
make
my
house
pleasant
to
her
and
useful
and
will
make
her
an
allowance
of
per
annum
for
her
clothes
as
long
as
she
may
remain
with
me
i
shall
expect
her
to
be
regular
at
meals
to
be
constant
in
going
to
church
and
not
to
read
modern
novels
i
intend
the
arrangement
to
be
permanent
but
of
course
i
must
retain
the
power
of
closing
it
if
and
when
i
shall
see
fit
its
permanence
must
be
contingent
on
my
life
i
have
no
power
of
providing
for
any
one
my
yours
truly
jemima
stanbury
i
hope
the
young
lady
does
not
have
any
false
hair
about
her
when
this
note
was
received
at
nuncombe
putney
the
amazement
which
it
occasioned
was
extreme
stanbury
the
widow
of
the
late
vicar
lived
in
a
little
morsel
of
a
cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
with
her
two
daughters
priscilla
and
dorothy
their
whole
income
out
of
which
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
pay
rent
for
their
cottage
was
less
than
per
annum
during
the
last
few
months
a
note
now
and
again
had
found
its
way
to
nuncombe
putney
out
of
the
coffers
of
the
but
the
ladies
there
were
most
unwilling
to
be
so
relieved
thinking
that
their
career
was
of
infinitely
more
importance
than
their
comforts
or
even
than
their
living
they
were
very
poor
but
they
were
accustomed
to
poverty
the
elder
sister
was
older
than
hugh
but
dorothy
the
younger
to
whom
this
strange
invitation
was
now
made
was
two
years
younger
than
her
brother
and
was
now
nearly
how
they
had
lived
and
dressed
themselves
and
had
continued
to
be
called
ladies
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
was
and
is
and
will
be
a
mystery
to
those
who
have
had
the
spending
of
much
larger
incomes
but
have
still
been
always
poor
but
they
had
lived
had
gone
to
church
every
sunday
in
decent
apparel
and
had
kept
up
friendly
relations
with
the
family
of
the
present
vicar
and
with
one
or
two
other
neighbours
when
the
letter
had
been
read
first
by
the
mother
and
then
aloud
and
then
by
each
of
them
separately
in
the
little
in
the
cottage
there
was
silence
among
them
for
neither
of
them
desired
to
be
the
first
to
express
an
opinion
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
the
proposed
arrangement
had
it
not
been
made
unnatural
by
a
quarrel
existing
nearly
throughout
the
whole
life
of
the
person
most
nearly
concerned
priscilla
the
elder
daughter
was
the
one
of
the
family
who
was
generally
the
ruler
and
she
at
last
expressed
an
opinion
adverse
to
the
arrangement
my
dear
you
would
never
be
able
to
bear
it
said
priscilla
i
suppose
not
said
stanbury
plaintively
i
could
try
said
dorothy
my
dear
you
do
know
that
woman
said
priscilla
of
course
i
do
know
her
said
dorothy
she
has
always
been
very
good
to
hugh
said
stanbury
i
do
think
she
has
been
good
to
him
at
all
said
priscilla
but
think
what
a
saving
it
would
be
said
dorothy
and
i
could
send
home
half
of
what
aunt
stanbury
says
she
would
give
me
you
must
not
think
of
that
said
priscilla
because
she
expects
you
to
be
dressed
i
should
like
to
try
she
said
before
the
morning
was
over
if
you
and
mamma
do
think
it
would
be
wrong
the
conference
that
day
ended
in
a
written
request
to
aunt
stanbury
that
a
week
might
be
allowed
for
consideration
the
letter
being
written
by
priscilla
but
signed
with
her
mother
name
and
with
a
very
long
epistle
to
hugh
in
which
each
of
the
ladies
took
a
part
and
in
which
advice
and
decision
were
demanded
it
was
very
evident
to
hugh
that
his
mother
and
dorothy
were
for
compliance
and
that
priscilla
was
for
refusal
but
he
never
doubted
for
a
moment
of
course
she
will
go
he
said
in
his
answer
to
priscilla
and
she
must
understand
that
aunt
stanbury
is
a
most
excellent
woman
as
true
as
the
sun
thoroughly
honest
with
no
fault
but
this
that
she
likes
her
own
way
of
course
dolly
can
go
back
again
if
she
finds
the
house
too
hard
for
her
then
he
sent
another
note
observing
that
dolly
journey
to
exeter
would
cost
money
and
that
her
wardrobe
would
want
some
improvement
i
very
glad
that
it
is
me
said
priscilla
who
however
did
not
attempt
to
oppose
the
decision
of
the
man
of
the
family
dorothy
was
greatly
gratified
by
the
excitement
of
the
proposed
change
in
her
life
and
the
following
letter
the
product
of
the
wisdom
of
the
family
was
written
by
stanbury
nuncombe
putney
may
my
dear
sister
stanbury
we
are
all
very
thankful
for
the
kindness
of
your
offer
which
my
daughter
dorothy
will
accept
with
feelings
of
affectionate
gratitude
i
think
you
will
find
her
docile
and
amiable
but
a
mother
of
course
speaks
well
of
her
own
child
she
will
endeavour
to
comply
with
your
wishes
in
all
things
reasonable
she
of
course
understands
that
should
the
arrangement
not
suit
she
will
come
back
home
on
the
expression
of
your
wish
that
it
should
be
so
and
she
will
of
course
do
the
same
if
she
should
find
that
living
in
exeter
does
not
suit
herself
this
sentence
was
inserted
at
the
instance
of
priscilla
after
much
urgent
expostulation
dorothy
will
be
ready
to
go
to
you
on
any
day
you
may
fix
after
the
of
this
month
believe
me
to
remain
your
affectionate
stanbury
she
going
to
come
said
miss
stanbury
to
martha
holding
the
letter
in
her
hand
i
never
doubted
her
coming
said
martha
and
i
mean
her
to
stay
unless
it
her
own
fault
she
have
the
small
room
looking
out
front
next
to
mine
and
you
must
go
and
fetch
her
go
and
fetch
her
yes
if
you
wo
i
must
she
ai
a
child
she
years
old
and
surely
she
can
come
to
exeter
by
herself
with
a
railroad
all
the
way
from
lessboro
there
no
place
a
young
woman
is
insulted
in
so
bad
as
those
railway
carriages
and
i
wo
have
her
come
by
herself
if
she
is
to
live
with
me
she
shall
begin
decently
at
any
rate
martha
argued
the
matter
but
was
of
course
beaten
and
on
the
day
fixed
started
early
in
the
morning
for
nuncombe
putney
and
returned
in
the
afternoon
to
the
close
with
her
charge
by
the
time
that
she
had
reached
the
house
she
had
in
some
degree
reconciled
herself
to
the
dangerous
step
that
her
mistress
had
taken
partly
by
perceiving
that
in
face
dorothy
stanbury
was
very
like
her
brother
hugh
and
partly
perhaps
by
finding
that
the
young
woman
manner
to
herself
was
both
gentle
and
sprightly
she
knew
well
that
gentleness
alone
without
some
of
strength
under
it
would
not
long
succeed
with
miss
stanbury
as
far
as
i
can
judge
she
a
sweet
young
lady
said
martha
when
she
reported
her
arrival
to
her
mistress
who
had
retired
to
her
own
room
in
order
that
she
might
thus
hear
a
word
of
tidings
from
her
lieutenant
before
she
showed
herself
on
the
field
of
action
sweet
i
hate
your
sweets
said
miss
stanbury
then
why
did
you
send
for
her
because
i
was
an
old
fool
but
i
must
go
down
and
receive
her
i
suppose
then
miss
stanbury
went
down
almost
trembling
as
she
went
the
matter
to
her
was
one
of
vital
importance
she
was
going
to
change
the
whole
tenour
of
her
life
for
the
sake
as
she
told
herself
of
doing
her
duty
by
a
relative
whom
she
did
not
even
know
but
we
may
fairly
suppose
that
there
had
in
truth
been
a
feeling
beyond
that
which
taught
her
to
desire
to
have
some
one
near
her
to
whom
she
might
not
only
do
her
duty
as
guardian
but
whom
she
might
also
love
she
had
tried
this
with
her
nephew
but
her
nephew
had
been
too
strong
for
her
too
far
from
her
too
unlike
to
herself
when
he
came
to
see
her
he
had
smoked
a
short
pipe
which
had
been
shocking
to
her
and
he
had
spoken
of
reform
and
trades
unions
and
meetings
in
the
parks
as
though
they
had
not
been
devil
ordinances
and
he
was
very
shy
of
going
to
church
utterly
refusing
to
be
taken
there
twice
on
the
same
sunday
and
he
had
told
his
aunt
that
owing
to
a
peculiar
and
unfortunate
weakness
in
his
constitution
he
could
not
listen
to
the
reading
of
sermons
and
then
she
was
almost
certain
that
he
had
once
kissed
one
of
the
maids
she
had
found
it
impossible
to
manage
him
in
any
way
and
when
he
positively
declared
himself
as
permanently
devoted
to
the
degrading
iniquities
of
penny
newspapers
she
had
thought
it
best
to
cast
him
off
altogether
now
thus
late
in
life
she
was
going
to
make
another
venture
to
try
an
altogether
new
mode
of
living
in
order
as
she
said
to
herself
that
she
might
be
of
some
use
to
somebody
but
no
doubt
with
a
further
unexpressed
hope
in
her
bosom
that
the
solitude
of
her
life
might
be
relieved
by
the
companionship
of
some
one
whom
she
might
love
she
had
arrayed
herself
in
a
clean
cap
and
her
evening
gown
and
she
went
looking
sternly
with
a
idea
that
she
must
initiate
her
new
duties
by
assuming
a
mastery
at
once
but
inwardly
she
trembled
and
was
intensely
anxious
as
to
the
first
appearance
of
her
niece
of
course
there
would
be
a
little
morsel
of
a
bonnet
she
hated
those
vile
patches
dirty
flat
daubs
of
millinery
as
she
called
them
but
they
had
become
too
general
for
her
to
refuse
admittance
for
such
a
thing
within
her
doors
but
a
chignon
a
bandbox
behind
the
noddle
she
would
not
endure
and
then
there
were
other
details
of
feminine
gear
which
shall
not
be
specified
as
to
which
she
was
painfully
anxious
almost
forgetting
in
her
anxiety
that
the
dress
of
this
young
woman
whom
she
was
about
to
see
must
have
ever
been
regulated
by
the
closest
possible
economy
the
first
thing
she
saw
on
entering
the
room
was
a
dark
straw
hat
a
straw
hat
with
a
strong
penthouse
flap
to
it
and
her
heart
was
immediately
softened
my
dear
she
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
dorothy
who
on
her
part
was
trembling
also
whose
position
was
one
to
justify
most
intense
anxiety
murmured
some
reply
take
off
your
hat
said
the
aunt
and
let
me
give
you
a
kiss
the
hat
was
taken
off
and
the
kiss
was
given
there
was
certainly
no
chignon
there
dorothy
stanbury
was
light
haired
with
almost
flaxen
ringlets
worn
after
the
way
which
we
used
to
think
so
pretty
when
we
were
young
she
had
very
soft
grey
eyes
which
ever
seemed
to
beseech
you
to
do
something
when
they
looked
at
you
and
her
mouth
was
a
beseeching
mouth
there
are
women
who
even
amidst
their
strongest
efforts
at
giving
assistance
to
others
always
look
as
though
they
were
asking
aid
themselves
and
such
a
one
was
dorothy
stanbury
her
complexion
was
pale
but
there
was
always
present
in
it
a
tint
of
pink
running
here
and
there
changing
with
every
word
she
spoke
changing
indeed
with
every
pulse
of
her
heart
nothing
ever
was
softer
than
her
cheek
but
her
hands
were
thin
and
hard
and
almost
fibrous
with
the
working
of
the
thread
upon
them
she
was
rather
tall
than
otherwise
but
that
extreme
look
of
feminine
dependence
which
always
accompanied
her
took
away
something
even
from
the
appearance
of
her
height
these
are
all
real
at
any
rate
said
her
aunt
taking
hold
of
the
curls
and
wo
be
hurt
by
a
little
cold
water
dorothy
smiled
but
said
nothing
and
was
then
taken
up
to
her
indeed
when
the
aunt
and
niece
sat
down
to
dinner
together
dorothy
had
hardly
spoken
but
miss
stanbury
had
spoken
and
things
upon
the
whole
had
gone
very
well
i
hope
you
like
roast
chicken
my
dear
said
miss
stanbury
oh
thank
you
and
bread
sauce
jane
i
do
hope
the
bread
sauce
is
hot
if
the
reader
thinks
that
miss
stanbury
was
indifferent
to
considerations
of
the
table
the
reader
is
altogether
ignorant
of
miss
stanbury
character
when
miss
stanbury
gave
her
niece
the
and
picked
out
from
the
attendant
sausages
one
that
had
been
well
browned
and
properly
broken
in
the
frying
she
meant
to
do
a
real
kindness
and
now
my
dear
there
are
mashed
potatoes
and
bread
sauce
as
for
green
vegetables
i
do
know
what
has
become
of
them
they
tell
me
i
may
have
green
peas
from
france
at
a
shilling
a
quart
but
if
i
ca
have
english
green
peas
i
wo
have
any
miss
stanbury
was
standing
up
as
she
said
this
as
she
always
did
on
such
occasions
liking
to
have
a
full
mastery
over
the
dish
i
hope
you
like
it
my
dear
everything
is
so
very
nice
that
right
i
like
to
see
a
young
woman
with
an
appetite
remember
that
god
sends
the
good
things
for
us
to
eat
and
as
long
as
we
do
take
more
than
our
share
and
give
away
something
to
those
who
have
a
fair
share
of
their
own
i
for
one
think
it
quite
right
to
enjoy
my
victuals
jane
this
bread
sauce
is
hot
it
never
is
hot
do
tell
me
i
know
what
hot
is
dorothy
thought
that
her
aunt
was
very
angry
but
jane
knew
miss
stanbury
better
and
bore
the
scolding
without
shaking
in
her
shoes
and
now
my
dear
you
must
take
a
glass
of
port
wine
it
will
do
you
good
after
your
journey
dorothy
attempted
to
explain
that
she
never
did
drink
any
wine
but
her
aunt
talked
down
her
scruples
at
once
one
glass
of
port
wine
never
did
anybody
any
harm
and
as
there
is
port
wine
it
must
be
intended
that
somebody
should
drink
it
miss
stanbury
as
she
sipped
hers
out
very
slowly
seemed
to
enjoy
it
much
although
may
had
come
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
and
she
sat
with
her
toes
on
the
fender
and
her
silk
dress
folded
up
above
her
knees
she
sat
quite
silent
in
this
position
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
every
now
and
then
raising
her
glass
to
her
lips
dorothy
sat
silent
also
to
her
in
the
newness
of
her
condition
speech
was
impossible
i
think
it
will
do
said
miss
stanbury
at
last
as
dorothy
had
no
idea
what
would
do
she
could
make
no
reply
to
this
i
sure
it
will
do
said
miss
stanbury
after
another
short
interval
you
as
like
my
poor
sister
as
two
eggs
you
do
have
headaches
do
you
dorothy
said
that
she
was
not
ordinarily
affected
in
that
way
when
girls
have
headaches
it
comes
from
and
not
walking
enough
and
carrying
all
manner
of
nasty
smells
about
with
them
i
know
what
headaches
mean
how
is
a
woman
not
to
have
a
headache
when
she
carries
a
thing
on
the
back
of
her
poll
as
big
as
a
gardener
come
it
a
fine
evening
and
go
out
and
look
at
the
towers
you
never
even
seen
them
yet
i
suppose
so
they
went
out
and
finding
the
verger
at
the
cathedral
door
he
being
a
great
friend
of
miss
stanbury
they
walked
up
and
down
the
aisles
and
dorothy
was
instructed
as
to
what
would
be
expected
from
her
in
regard
to
the
outward
forms
of
religion
she
was
to
go
to
the
cathedral
service
on
the
morning
of
every
and
on
sundays
in
the
afternoon
on
sunday
mornings
she
was
to
attend
the
little
church
of
margaret
on
sunday
evenings
it
was
the
practice
of
miss
stanbury
to
read
a
sermon
in
the
to
all
of
whom
her
household
consisted
did
dorothy
like
daily
services
dorothy
who
was
more
patient
than
her
brother
and
whose
life
had
been
much
less
energetic
said
that
she
had
no
objection
to
going
to
church
every
day
when
there
was
not
too
much
to
do
there
never
need
be
too
much
to
do
to
attend
the
lord
house
said
miss
stanbury
somewhat
angrily
only
if
you
got
to
make
the
beds
said
dorothy
my
dear
i
beg
your
pardon
said
miss
stanbury
i
beg
your
pardon
heartily
i
a
thoughtless
old
woman
i
know
never
mind
now
go
in
later
in
the
evening
when
she
gave
her
niece
a
candlestick
to
go
to
bed
she
repeated
what
she
had
said
before
it
do
very
well
my
dear
i
sure
it
do
but
if
you
read
in
bed
either
night
or
morning
i
never
forgive
you
this
last
caution
was
uttered
with
so
much
energy
that
dorothy
gave
a
little
jump
as
she
promised
obedience
chapter
ix
shewing
how
the
quarrel
progressed
again
on
one
sunday
morning
when
the
month
of
may
was
nearly
over
hugh
stanbury
met
colonel
osborne
in
curzon
street
not
many
yards
from
trevelyan
door
colonel
osborne
had
just
come
from
the
house
and
stanbury
was
going
to
it
hugh
had
not
spoken
to
osborne
since
the
day
now
a
fortnight
since
on
which
both
of
them
had
witnessed
the
scene
in
the
park
but
on
that
occasion
they
had
been
left
together
and
it
had
been
impossible
for
them
not
to
say
a
few
words
about
their
mutual
friends
osborne
had
expressed
his
sorrow
that
there
should
be
any
misunderstanding
and
had
called
trevelyan
a
confounded
fool
stanbury
had
suggested
that
there
was
something
in
it
which
they
two
probably
did
not
understand
and
that
matters
would
be
sure
to
come
all
right
the
truth
is
trevelyan
bullies
her
said
osborne
and
if
he
goes
on
with
that
he
be
sure
to
get
the
worst
of
it
now
on
this
present
occasion
stanbury
asked
whether
he
would
find
the
ladies
at
home
yes
they
are
both
there
said
osborne
trevelyan
has
just
gone
out
in
a
huff
she
never
be
able
to
go
on
living
with
him
anybody
can
see
that
with
half
an
eye
then
he
had
passed
on
and
hugh
stanbury
knocked
at
the
door
he
was
shown
up
into
the
and
found
both
the
sisters
there
but
he
could
see
that
trevelyan
had
been
in
tears
the
avowed
purpose
of
his
visit
that
is
the
purpose
which
he
had
avowed
to
himself
was
to
talk
about
his
sister
dorothy
he
had
told
miss
rowley
while
walking
in
the
park
with
her
how
dorothy
had
been
invited
over
to
exeter
by
her
aunt
and
how
he
had
counselled
his
sister
to
accept
the
invitation
nora
had
expressed
herself
very
interested
as
to
dorothy
fate
and
had
said
how
much
she
wished
that
she
knew
dorothy
we
all
understand
how
sweet
it
is
when
two
such
persons
as
hugh
stanbury
and
nora
rowley
can
not
speak
of
their
love
for
each
other
to
say
these
tender
things
in
regard
to
some
one
else
nora
had
been
quite
anxious
to
know
how
dorothy
had
been
received
by
that
old
conservative
warrior
as
hugh
stanbury
had
called
his
aunt
and
hugh
had
now
come
to
curzon
street
with
a
letter
from
dorothy
in
his
pocket
but
when
he
saw
that
there
had
been
some
cause
for
trouble
he
hardly
knew
how
to
introduce
his
subject
trevelyan
is
not
at
home
he
asked
no
said
emily
with
her
face
turned
away
he
went
out
and
left
us
a
quarter
of
an
hour
since
did
you
meet
colonel
osborne
i
was
speaking
to
him
in
the
street
not
a
moment
since
as
he
answered
he
could
see
that
nora
was
making
some
sign
to
her
sister
nora
was
most
anxious
that
emily
should
not
speak
of
what
had
just
occurred
but
her
signs
were
all
thrown
away
somebody
must
tell
him
said
trevelyan
and
i
do
know
who
can
do
so
better
than
so
old
a
friend
as
mr
stanbury
tell
what
and
to
whom
he
asked
no
no
no
said
nora
then
i
must
tell
him
myself
said
she
that
is
all
as
for
standing
this
kind
of
life
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
should
either
destroy
myself
or
go
mad
if
i
could
do
any
good
i
should
be
so
happy
said
stanbury
nobody
can
do
any
good
between
a
man
and
his
wife
said
nora
then
trevelyan
began
to
tell
her
story
putting
aside
with
an
impatient
motion
of
her
hands
the
efforts
which
her
sister
made
to
stop
her
she
was
very
angry
and
as
she
told
it
standing
up
all
trace
of
sobbing
soon
disappeared
from
her
voice
the
fact
is
she
said
he
does
not
know
his
own
mind
or
what
to
fear
or
what
not
to
fear
he
told
me
that
i
was
never
to
see
colonel
osborne
again
what
is
the
use
emily
of
your
repeating
that
to
mr
stanbury
why
should
i
not
repeat
it
colonel
osborne
is
papa
oldest
friend
and
mine
too
he
is
a
man
i
like
very
much
who
is
a
real
friend
to
me
as
he
is
old
enough
to
be
my
father
one
would
have
thought
that
my
husband
could
have
found
no
objection
i
do
know
much
about
his
age
said
stanbury
it
does
make
a
difference
it
must
make
a
difference
i
should
not
think
of
becoming
so
intimate
with
a
younger
man
but
however
when
my
husband
told
me
that
i
was
to
see
him
no
more
though
the
insult
nearly
killed
me
i
determined
to
obey
him
an
order
was
given
that
colonel
osborne
should
not
be
admitted
you
may
imagine
how
painful
it
was
but
it
was
given
and
i
was
prepared
to
bear
it
but
he
had
been
lunching
with
you
on
that
sunday
yes
that
is
just
it
as
soon
as
it
was
given
louis
would
rescind
it
because
he
was
ashamed
of
what
he
had
done
he
was
so
jealous
that
he
did
not
want
me
to
see
the
man
and
yet
he
was
so
afraid
that
it
should
be
known
that
he
ordered
me
to
see
him
he
ordered
him
into
the
house
at
last
and
i
i
went
away
that
was
on
the
sunday
that
we
met
you
in
the
park
asked
stanbury
what
is
the
use
of
going
back
to
all
that
said
nora
then
i
met
him
by
chance
in
the
park
continued
trevelyan
and
because
he
said
a
word
which
i
knew
would
anger
my
husband
i
left
him
abruptly
since
that
my
husband
has
begged
that
things
might
go
on
as
they
were
before
he
could
not
bear
that
colonel
osborne
himself
should
think
that
he
was
jealous
well
i
gave
way
and
the
man
has
been
here
as
before
and
now
there
has
been
a
scene
which
has
been
disgraceful
to
us
all
i
can
not
stand
it
and
i
wo
if
he
does
not
behave
himself
with
more
manliness
i
will
leave
him
but
what
can
i
do
nothing
stanbury
said
nora
yes
you
can
do
this
you
can
go
to
him
from
me
and
can
tell
him
that
i
have
chosen
you
as
a
messenger
because
you
are
his
friend
you
can
tell
him
that
i
am
willing
to
obey
him
in
anything
if
he
chooses
i
will
consent
that
colonel
osborne
shall
be
asked
never
to
come
into
my
presence
again
it
will
be
very
absurd
but
if
he
chooses
i
will
consent
or
i
will
let
things
go
on
as
they
are
and
continue
to
receive
my
father
old
friend
when
he
comes
but
if
i
do
i
will
not
put
up
with
an
imputation
on
my
conduct
because
he
does
not
like
the
way
in
which
the
gentleman
thinks
fit
to
address
me
i
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
if
any
man
alive
spoke
to
me
as
he
ought
not
to
speak
i
should
know
how
to
resent
it
myself
but
i
can
not
fly
into
a
passion
with
an
old
gentleman
for
calling
me
by
my
christian
name
when
he
has
done
so
habitually
for
years
from
all
this
it
will
appear
that
the
great
godsend
of
a
rich
marriage
with
all
manner
of
attendant
comforts
which
had
come
in
the
way
of
the
rowley
family
as
they
were
living
at
the
mandarins
had
not
turned
out
to
be
an
unmixed
blessing
in
the
matter
of
the
quarrel
as
it
had
hitherto
progressed
the
husband
had
perhaps
been
more
in
the
wrong
than
his
wife
but
the
wife
in
spite
of
all
her
promises
of
perfect
obedience
had
proved
herself
to
be
a
woman
very
hard
to
manage
had
she
been
earnest
in
her
desire
to
please
her
lord
and
master
in
this
matter
of
colonel
osborne
visits
to
please
him
even
after
he
had
so
vacillated
in
his
own
behests
she
might
probably
have
so
received
the
man
as
to
have
quelled
all
feeling
of
jealousy
in
her
husband
bosom
but
instead
of
doing
so
she
had
told
herself
that
as
she
was
innocent
and
as
her
innocence
had
been
acknowledged
and
as
she
had
been
specially
instructed
to
receive
this
man
whom
she
had
before
been
specially
instructed
not
to
receive
she
would
now
fall
back
exactly
into
her
old
manner
with
him
she
had
told
colonel
osborne
never
to
allude
to
that
meeting
in
the
park
and
to
ask
no
creature
as
to
what
had
occasioned
her
conduct
on
that
sunday
thus
having
a
mystery
with
him
which
of
course
he
understood
as
well
as
she
did
and
then
she
had
again
taken
to
writing
notes
to
him
and
receiving
notes
from
him
none
of
which
she
showed
to
her
husband
she
was
more
intimate
with
him
than
ever
and
yet
she
hardly
ever
mentioned
his
name
to
her
husband
trevelyan
acknowledging
to
himself
that
he
had
done
no
good
by
his
former
interference
feeling
that
he
had
put
himself
in
the
wrong
on
that
occasion
and
that
his
wife
had
got
the
better
of
him
had
borne
with
all
this
with
soreness
and
a
moody
savageness
of
general
conduct
but
still
without
further
words
of
anger
with
reference
to
the
man
himself
but
now
on
this
sunday
when
his
wife
had
been
closeted
with
colonel
osborne
in
the
back
leaving
him
with
his
his
temper
had
become
too
hot
for
him
and
he
had
suddenly
left
the
house
declaring
that
he
would
not
walk
with
the
two
women
on
that
day
why
not
louis
his
wife
had
said
coming
up
to
him
never
mind
why
not
but
i
shall
not
he
had
answered
and
then
he
left
the
room
what
is
the
matter
with
him
colonel
osborne
had
asked
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
is
the
matter
with
him
trevelyan
had
replied
after
that
she
had
at
once
gone
to
her
child
telling
herself
that
she
was
doing
all
that
the
strictest
propriety
could
require
in
leaving
the
man
society
as
soon
as
her
husband
was
gone
then
there
was
an
awkward
minute
or
two
between
nora
and
colonel
osborne
and
he
took
his
leave
stanbury
at
last
promised
that
he
would
see
trevelyan
repeating
however
very
frequently
that
assertion
that
no
task
is
so
hopeless
as
that
of
interfering
between
a
man
and
his
wife
nevertheless
he
promised
and
undertook
to
look
for
trevelyan
at
the
acrobats
on
that
afternoon
at
last
he
got
a
moment
in
which
to
produce
the
letter
from
his
sister
and
was
able
to
turn
the
conversation
for
a
few
minutes
to
his
own
affairs
dorothy
letter
was
read
and
discussed
by
both
the
ladies
with
much
zeal
it
is
quite
a
strange
world
to
me
said
dorothy
but
i
am
beginning
to
find
myself
more
at
my
ease
than
i
was
at
first
aunt
stanbury
is
very
and
when
i
know
what
she
wants
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
please
her
what
you
said
of
her
disposition
is
not
so
bad
to
me
as
of
course
a
girl
in
my
position
does
not
expect
to
have
her
own
way
why
should
she
have
her
share
of
her
own
way
as
well
as
anybody
else
said
trevelyan
poor
dorothy
would
never
want
to
have
her
own
way
said
hugh
she
ought
to
want
it
said
trevelyan
she
has
spirit
enough
to
turn
if
she
trodden
on
said
hugh
that
more
than
what
most
women
have
said
trevelyan
then
he
went
on
with
the
letter
she
is
very
generous
and
has
given
me
in
advance
of
my
allowance
when
i
said
i
would
send
part
of
it
home
to
mamma
she
seemed
to
be
angry
and
said
that
she
wanted
me
always
to
look
nice
about
my
clothes
she
told
me
afterwards
to
do
as
i
pleased
and
that
i
might
try
my
own
way
for
the
first
quarter
so
i
was
frightened
and
only
sent
thirty
shillings
we
went
out
the
other
evening
to
drink
tea
with
machugh
an
old
lady
whose
husband
was
once
dean
i
had
to
go
and
it
was
all
very
nice
there
were
a
great
many
clergymen
there
but
many
of
them
were
young
men
poor
dorothy
exclaimed
nora
one
of
them
was
the
minor
canon
who
chants
the
service
every
morning
he
is
a
bachelor
then
there
is
a
hope
for
her
said
nora
and
he
always
talks
a
little
as
though
he
were
singing
the
litany
that
very
bad
said
nora
fancy
having
a
husband
to
sing
the
litany
to
you
always
better
that
perhaps
than
having
him
always
singing
something
else
said
trevelyan
it
was
decided
between
them
that
dorothy
state
might
on
the
whole
be
considered
as
flourishing
but
that
hugh
was
bound
as
a
brother
to
go
down
to
exeter
and
look
after
her
he
explained
however
that
he
was
expressly
debarred
from
calling
on
his
sister
even
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
twelve
on
wednesday
mornings
and
that
he
could
not
see
her
at
all
unless
he
did
so
surreptitiously
if
i
were
you
i
would
see
my
sister
in
spite
of
all
the
old
viragos
in
exeter
said
trevelyan
i
have
no
idea
of
anybody
taking
so
much
upon
themselves
you
must
remember
trevelyan
that
she
has
taken
upon
herself
much
also
in
the
way
of
kindness
in
doing
what
perhaps
i
ought
to
call
charity
i
wonder
what
i
should
have
been
doing
now
if
it
were
not
for
my
aunt
stanbury
he
took
his
leave
and
went
at
once
from
curzon
street
to
club
and
found
that
trevelyan
had
not
been
there
as
yet
in
another
hour
he
called
again
and
was
about
to
give
it
up
when
he
met
the
man
whom
he
was
seeking
on
the
steps
i
was
looking
for
you
he
said
well
here
i
am
it
was
impossible
not
to
see
in
the
look
of
trevelyan
face
and
not
to
hear
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
he
was
at
the
moment
in
an
angry
and
unhappy
frame
of
mind
he
did
not
move
as
though
he
were
willing
to
accompany
his
friend
and
seemed
almost
to
know
beforehand
that
the
approaching
interview
was
to
be
an
unpleasant
one
i
want
to
speak
to
you
and
perhaps
you
would
mind
taking
a
turn
with
me
said
stanbury
but
trevelyan
objected
to
this
and
led
the
way
into
the
club
a
club
is
always
a
gloomy
unpromising
place
for
a
confidential
conversation
and
so
stanbury
felt
it
to
be
on
the
present
occasion
but
he
had
no
alternative
there
they
were
together
and
he
must
do
as
he
had
promised
trevelyan
kept
on
his
hat
and
did
not
sit
down
and
looked
very
gloomy
stanbury
having
to
commence
without
any
assistance
from
outward
auxiliaries
almost
forgot
what
it
was
that
he
had
promised
to
do
i
have
just
come
from
curzon
street
he
said
well
at
least
i
was
there
about
two
hours
ago
it
does
matter
i
suppose
whether
it
was
two
hours
or
two
minutes
said
trevelyan
not
in
the
least
the
fact
is
this
i
happened
to
come
upon
the
two
girls
there
when
they
were
very
unhappy
and
your
wife
asked
me
to
come
and
say
a
word
or
two
to
you
was
colonel
osborne
there
no
i
had
met
him
in
the
street
a
minute
or
two
before
well
now
look
here
stanbury
if
you
take
my
advice
keep
your
hands
out
of
this
it
is
not
but
that
i
regard
you
as
being
as
good
a
friend
as
i
have
in
the
world
but
to
own
the
truth
i
can
not
put
up
with
interference
between
myself
and
my
wife
of
course
you
understand
that
i
only
come
as
a
messenger
illustration
i
only
come
as
a
messenger
you
had
better
not
be
a
messenger
in
such
a
cause
if
she
has
anything
to
say
she
can
say
it
to
myself
am
i
to
understand
that
you
will
not
listen
to
me
i
had
rather
not
i
think
you
are
wrong
said
stanbury
in
that
matter
you
must
allow
me
to
judge
for
myself
i
can
easily
understand
that
a
young
woman
like
her
especially
with
her
sister
to
back
her
should
induce
such
a
one
as
you
to
take
her
part
i
am
taking
nobody
part
you
wrong
your
wife
and
you
especially
wrong
miss
rowley
if
you
please
stanbury
we
will
say
nothing
more
about
it
this
trevelyan
said
holding
the
door
of
the
room
half
open
in
his
hand
so
that
the
other
was
obliged
to
pass
out
through
it
good
evening
said
stanbury
with
much
anger
good
evening
said
trevelyan
with
an
assumption
of
indifference
stanbury
went
away
in
absolute
wrath
though
the
trouble
which
he
had
had
in
the
interview
was
much
less
than
he
had
anticipated
and
the
result
quite
as
favourable
he
had
known
that
no
good
would
come
of
his
visit
and
yet
he
was
now
full
of
anger
against
trevelyan
and
had
become
a
partisan
in
the
matter
which
was
exactly
that
which
he
had
resolutely
determined
that
he
would
not
become
i
believe
that
no
woman
on
earth
could
live
with
him
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
away
it
was
always
the
same
with
him
a
desire
for
mastery
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
use
when
he
had
obtained
it
if
it
were
nora
instead
of
the
other
sister
he
would
break
her
sweet
heart
within
a
month
trevelyan
dined
at
his
club
and
hardly
spoke
a
word
to
any
one
during
the
evening
at
about
eleven
he
started
to
walk
home
but
went
by
no
means
straight
thither
taking
a
long
turn
through
james
park
and
by
pimlico
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
make
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
would
do
he
had
sternly
refused
the
interference
of
a
friend
and
he
must
be
prepared
to
act
on
his
own
responsibility
he
knew
well
that
he
could
not
begin
again
with
his
wife
on
the
next
day
as
though
nothing
had
happened
stanbury
visit
to
him
if
it
had
done
nothing
else
had
made
this
impossible
he
determined
that
he
would
not
go
to
her
room
but
would
see
her
as
early
as
possible
in
the
morning
and
would
then
talk
to
her
with
all
the
wisdom
of
which
he
was
master
how
many
husbands
have
come
to
the
same
resolution
and
how
few
of
them
have
found
the
words
of
wisdom
to
be
efficacious
chapter
x
hard
words
illustration
it
is
to
be
feared
that
men
in
general
do
not
regret
as
they
should
do
any
temporary
or
irritating
jealousy
between
husbands
and
wives
of
which
they
themselves
have
been
the
cause
the
author
is
not
speaking
now
of
actual
of
intrigues
and
devilish
villany
either
perpetrated
or
imagined
but
rather
of
those
passing
gusts
of
and
unfounded
suspicion
to
which
as
to
other
accidents
very
families
may
occasionally
be
liable
when
such
suspicion
rises
in
the
bosom
of
a
wife
some
woman
intervening
or
being
believed
to
intervene
between
her
and
the
man
who
is
her
own
that
woman
who
has
intervened
or
been
supposed
to
intervene
will
either
glory
in
her
position
or
bewail
it
bitterly
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
we
will
charitably
suppose
that
in
a
great
majority
of
such
instances
she
will
bewail
it
but
when
such
painful
jealous
doubts
annoy
the
husband
the
man
who
is
in
the
way
will
almost
always
feel
himself
justified
in
extracting
a
slightly
pleasurable
sensation
from
the
transaction
he
will
say
to
himself
probably
unconsciously
indeed
and
with
no
formed
words
that
the
husband
is
an
ass
an
ass
if
he
be
in
a
twitter
either
for
that
which
he
has
kept
or
for
that
which
he
has
been
unable
to
keep
that
the
lady
has
shewn
a
good
deal
of
appreciation
and
that
he
himself
is
is
is
quite
a
captain
bold
of
halifax
all
the
while
he
will
not
have
the
slightest
intention
of
wronging
the
husband
honour
and
will
have
received
no
greater
favour
from
the
intimacy
accorded
to
him
than
the
privilege
of
running
on
one
day
to
marshall
and
snellgrove
the
haberdashers
and
on
another
to
handcocks
the
jewellers
if
he
be
allowed
to
buy
a
present
or
two
or
to
pay
a
few
shillings
here
or
there
he
has
achieved
much
terrible
things
now
and
again
do
occur
even
here
in
england
but
women
with
us
are
slow
to
burn
their
household
gods
it
happens
however
occasionally
as
we
are
all
aware
that
the
outward
garments
of
a
domestic
deity
will
be
a
little
scorched
and
when
this
occurs
the
man
who
is
the
interloper
will
generally
find
a
gentle
consolation
in
his
position
let
its
interest
be
ever
so
flaccid
and
unreal
and
its
troubles
in
running
about
and
the
like
ever
so
considerable
and
it
was
so
certainly
with
colonel
osborne
when
he
became
aware
that
his
intimacy
with
trevelyan
had
caused
her
husband
uneasiness
he
was
not
especially
a
vicious
man
and
had
now
as
we
know
reached
a
time
of
life
when
such
vice
as
that
in
question
might
be
supposed
to
have
lost
its
charm
for
him
a
gentleman
over
fifty
popular
in
london
with
a
seat
in
parliament
fond
of
good
dinners
and
possessed
of
everything
which
the
world
has
to
give
could
hardly
have
wished
to
run
away
with
his
neighbour
wife
or
to
have
destroyed
the
happiness
of
his
old
friend
daughter
such
wickedness
had
never
come
into
his
head
but
he
had
a
certain
pleasure
in
being
the
confidential
friend
of
a
very
pretty
woman
and
when
he
heard
that
that
pretty
woman
husband
was
jealous
the
pleasure
was
enhanced
rather
than
otherwise
on
that
sunday
as
he
had
left
the
house
in
curzon
street
he
had
told
stanbury
that
trevelyan
had
just
gone
off
in
a
huff
which
was
true
enough
and
he
had
walked
from
thence
down
clarges
street
and
across
piccadilly
to
street
with
a
jauntier
step
than
usual
because
he
was
aware
that
he
himself
had
been
the
occasion
of
that
trouble
this
was
very
wrong
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
many
such
men
as
colonel
osborne
who
are
bachelors
at
fifty
are
equally
malicious
he
thought
a
good
deal
about
it
on
that
evening
and
was
still
thinking
about
it
on
the
following
morning
he
had
promised
to
go
up
to
curzon
street
on
the
monday
really
on
some
most
trivial
mission
on
a
matter
of
business
which
no
man
could
have
taken
in
hand
whose
time
was
of
the
slightest
value
to
himself
or
any
one
else
but
now
that
mission
assumed
an
importance
in
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
require
either
a
special
observance
or
a
special
excuse
there
was
no
real
reason
why
he
should
not
have
stayed
away
from
curzon
street
for
the
next
fortnight
and
had
he
done
so
he
need
have
made
no
excuse
to
trevelyan
when
he
met
her
but
the
opportunity
for
a
little
excitement
was
not
to
be
missed
and
instead
of
going
he
wrote
to
her
the
following
note
albany
monday
dear
emily
what
was
it
all
about
yesterday
i
was
to
have
come
up
with
the
words
of
that
opera
but
perhaps
it
will
be
better
to
send
it
if
it
be
not
wicked
do
tell
me
whether
i
am
to
consider
myself
as
a
banished
man
i
thought
that
our
little
meetings
were
so
innocent
and
so
pleasant
the
monster
is
of
all
monsters
the
most
monstrous
and
the
most
unreasonable
pray
let
me
have
a
line
if
it
be
not
forbidden
yours
always
heartily
o
putting
aside
all
joking
i
beg
you
to
remember
that
i
consider
myself
always
entitled
to
be
regarded
by
you
as
your
most
sincere
friend
when
this
was
brought
to
trevelyan
about
twelve
in
the
day
she
had
already
undergone
the
infliction
of
those
words
of
wisdom
which
her
husband
had
prepared
for
her
and
which
were
threatened
at
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
her
husband
had
come
up
to
her
while
she
was
yet
in
her
and
had
striven
hard
to
prevail
against
her
but
his
success
had
been
very
doubtful
in
regard
to
the
number
of
words
trevelyan
certainly
had
had
the
best
of
it
as
far
as
any
understanding
one
of
another
was
concerned
the
conversation
had
been
useless
she
believed
herself
to
be
injured
and
aggrieved
and
would
continue
so
to
assert
let
him
implore
her
to
listen
to
him
as
loudly
as
he
might
yes
i
will
listen
and
i
will
obey
you
she
had
said
but
i
will
not
endure
such
insults
without
telling
you
that
i
feel
them
then
he
had
left
her
fully
conscious
that
he
had
failed
and
went
forth
out
of
his
house
into
the
city
to
his
club
to
wander
about
the
streets
not
knowing
what
he
had
best
do
to
bring
back
that
state
of
tranquillity
at
home
which
he
felt
to
be
so
desirable
trevelyan
was
alone
when
colonel
osborne
note
was
brought
to
her
and
was
at
that
moment
struggling
with
herself
in
anger
against
her
husband
if
he
laid
any
command
upon
her
she
would
execute
it
but
she
would
never
cease
to
tell
him
that
he
had
her
she
would
din
it
into
his
ears
let
him
come
to
her
as
often
as
he
might
with
his
wise
words
wise
words
what
was
the
use
of
wise
words
when
a
man
was
such
a
fool
in
nature
and
as
for
colonel
osborne
she
would
see
him
if
he
came
to
her
three
times
a
day
unless
her
husband
gave
some
clearly
intelligible
order
to
the
contrary
she
was
fortifying
her
mind
with
this
resolution
when
colonel
letter
was
brought
to
her
she
asked
whether
any
servant
was
waiting
for
an
answer
no
the
servant
who
had
left
it
had
gone
at
once
she
read
the
note
and
sat
working
with
it
before
her
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
walked
over
to
her
desk
and
answered
it
my
dear
colonel
osborne
it
will
be
best
to
say
nothing
whatever
about
the
occurrence
of
yesterday
and
if
possible
not
to
think
of
it
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
wish
for
no
change
except
that
people
should
be
more
reasonable
you
can
call
of
course
whenever
you
please
and
i
am
very
grateful
for
your
expression
of
friendship
yours
most
sincerely
emily
trevelyan
thanks
for
the
words
of
the
opera
when
she
had
written
this
being
determined
that
all
should
be
open
and
above
board
she
put
a
penny
stamp
on
the
envelope
and
desired
that
the
letter
should
be
posted
but
she
destroyed
that
which
she
had
received
from
colonel
osborne
in
all
things
she
would
act
as
she
would
have
done
if
her
husband
had
not
been
so
foolish
and
there
could
have
been
no
reason
why
she
should
have
kept
so
unimportant
a
communication
in
the
course
of
the
day
trevelyan
passed
through
the
hall
to
the
room
which
he
himself
was
accustomed
to
occupy
behind
the
parlour
and
as
he
did
so
saw
the
note
lying
ready
to
be
posted
took
it
up
and
read
the
address
he
held
it
for
a
moment
in
his
hand
then
replaced
it
on
the
hall
table
and
passed
on
when
he
reached
his
own
table
he
sat
down
hurriedly
and
took
up
in
his
hand
some
review
that
was
lying
ready
for
him
to
read
but
he
was
quite
unable
to
fix
his
mind
upon
the
words
before
him
he
had
spoken
to
his
wife
on
that
morning
in
the
strongest
language
he
could
use
as
to
the
unseemliness
of
her
intimacy
with
colonel
osborne
and
then
the
first
thing
she
had
done
when
his
back
was
turned
was
to
write
to
this
very
colonel
osborne
and
tell
him
no
doubt
what
had
occurred
between
her
and
her
husband
he
sat
thinking
of
it
all
for
many
minutes
he
would
probably
have
declared
himself
that
he
had
thought
of
it
for
an
hour
as
he
sat
there
then
he
got
up
went
and
walked
slowly
into
the
there
he
found
his
wife
sitting
with
her
sister
nora
he
said
i
want
to
speak
to
emily
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
ask
you
to
leave
us
for
a
few
minutes
nora
with
an
anxious
look
at
emily
got
up
and
left
the
room
why
do
you
send
her
away
said
trevelyan
because
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
you
for
a
few
minutes
since
what
i
said
to
you
this
morning
you
have
written
to
colonel
osborne
yes
i
have
i
do
not
know
how
you
have
found
it
out
but
i
suppose
you
keep
a
watch
on
me
i
keep
no
watch
on
you
as
i
came
into
the
house
i
saw
your
letter
lying
in
the
hall
very
well
you
could
have
read
it
if
you
pleased
emily
this
matter
is
becoming
very
serious
and
i
strongly
advise
you
to
be
on
your
guard
in
what
you
say
i
will
bear
much
for
you
and
much
for
our
boy
but
i
will
not
bear
to
have
my
name
made
a
reproach
sir
if
you
think
your
name
is
shamed
by
me
we
had
better
part
said
trevelyan
rising
from
her
chair
and
confronting
him
with
a
look
before
which
his
own
almost
quailed
it
may
be
that
we
had
better
part
he
said
slowly
but
in
the
first
place
i
wish
you
to
tell
me
what
were
the
contents
of
that
letter
if
it
was
there
when
you
came
in
no
doubt
it
is
there
still
go
and
look
at
it
that
is
no
answer
to
me
i
have
desired
you
to
tell
me
what
are
its
contents
i
shall
not
tell
you
i
will
not
demean
myself
by
repeating
anything
so
insignificant
in
my
own
justification
if
you
suspect
me
of
writing
what
i
should
not
write
you
will
suspect
me
also
of
lying
to
conceal
it
have
you
heard
from
colonel
osborne
this
morning
i
have
and
where
is
his
letter
i
have
destroyed
it
again
he
paused
trying
to
think
what
he
had
better
do
trying
to
be
calm
and
she
stood
still
opposite
to
him
confronting
him
with
the
scorn
of
her
bright
angry
eyes
of
course
he
was
not
calm
he
was
the
very
reverse
of
calm
and
you
refuse
to
tell
me
what
you
wrote
he
said
the
letter
is
there
she
answered
pointing
away
towards
the
door
if
you
want
to
play
the
spy
go
and
look
at
it
for
yourself
do
you
call
me
a
spy
and
what
have
you
called
me
because
you
are
a
husband
is
the
privilege
of
vituperation
to
be
all
on
your
side
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
put
up
with
this
he
said
quite
impossible
this
would
kill
me
anything
is
better
than
this
my
present
orders
to
you
are
not
to
see
colonel
osborne
not
to
write
to
him
or
have
any
communication
with
him
and
to
put
under
cover
to
me
unopened
any
letter
that
may
come
from
him
i
shall
expect
your
implicit
obedience
to
these
orders
well
go
on
have
i
your
promise
no
no
you
have
no
promise
i
will
make
no
promise
exacted
from
me
in
so
disgraceful
a
manner
you
refuse
to
obey
me
i
will
refuse
nothing
and
will
promise
nothing
then
we
must
part
that
is
all
i
will
take
care
that
you
shall
hear
from
me
before
morning
so
saying
he
left
the
room
and
passing
through
the
hall
saw
that
the
letter
had
been
taken
away
chapter
xi
lady
milborough
as
ambassador
of
course
i
know
you
are
right
said
nora
to
her
sister
right
as
far
as
colonel
osborne
is
concerned
but
nevertheless
you
ought
to
give
way
and
be
trampled
upon
said
trevelyan
yes
and
be
trampled
upon
if
he
should
trample
on
you
which
however
he
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
do
and
to
endure
any
insult
and
any
names
you
yourself
you
would
be
a
griselda
i
suppose
i
do
want
to
talk
about
myself
said
nora
nor
about
griselda
but
i
know
that
however
unreasonable
it
may
seem
you
had
better
give
way
to
him
now
and
tell
him
what
there
was
in
the
note
to
colonel
osborne
never
he
has
ordered
me
not
to
see
him
or
to
write
to
him
or
to
open
his
letters
having
mind
you
ordered
just
the
reverse
a
day
or
two
before
and
i
will
obey
him
absurd
as
it
is
i
will
obey
him
but
as
for
submitting
to
him
and
letting
him
suppose
that
i
think
he
is
right
never
i
should
be
lying
to
him
then
and
i
will
never
lie
to
him
he
has
said
that
we
must
part
and
i
suppose
it
will
be
better
so
how
can
a
woman
live
with
a
man
that
suspects
her
he
can
not
take
my
baby
from
me
there
were
many
such
conversations
as
the
above
between
the
two
sisters
before
trevelyan
received
from
her
husband
the
communication
with
which
she
had
been
threatened
and
nora
acting
on
her
own
judgment
in
the
matter
made
an
attempt
to
see
trevelyan
writing
to
him
a
pretty
little
note
and
beseeching
him
to
be
kind
to
her
but
he
declined
to
see
her
and
the
two
women
sat
at
home
with
the
baby
between
them
holding
such
pleasant
conversations
as
that
above
narrated
when
such
tempests
occur
in
a
family
a
woman
will
generally
suffer
the
least
during
the
thick
of
the
tempest
while
the
hurricane
is
at
the
fiercest
she
will
be
sustained
by
the
most
thorough
conviction
that
the
right
is
on
her
side
that
she
is
aggrieved
that
there
is
nothing
for
her
to
acknowledge
and
no
position
that
she
need
surrender
whereas
her
husband
will
desire
a
compromise
even
amidst
the
violence
of
the
storm
but
afterwards
when
the
wind
has
lulled
but
while
the
heavens
around
are
still
all
black
and
murky
then
the
woman
sufferings
begin
when
passion
gives
way
to
thought
and
memory
she
feels
the
loneliness
of
her
position
the
loneliness
and
the
possible
degradation
it
is
all
very
well
for
a
man
to
talk
about
his
name
and
his
honour
but
it
is
the
woman
honour
and
the
woman
name
that
are
in
truth
placed
in
jeopardy
let
the
woman
do
what
she
will
the
man
can
in
truth
show
his
face
in
the
world
and
after
awhile
does
show
his
face
but
the
woman
may
be
compelled
to
veil
hers
either
by
her
own
fault
or
by
his
trevelyan
was
now
told
that
she
was
to
be
separated
from
her
husband
and
she
did
not
at
any
rate
believe
that
she
had
done
any
harm
but
if
such
separation
did
come
where
could
she
live
what
could
she
do
what
position
in
the
world
would
she
possess
would
not
her
face
be
in
truth
veiled
as
effectually
as
though
she
had
disgraced
herself
and
her
husband
and
then
there
was
that
terrible
question
about
the
child
trevelyan
had
said
a
dozen
times
to
her
sister
that
her
husband
could
not
take
the
boy
away
from
her
nora
however
had
never
assented
to
this
partly
from
a
conviction
of
her
own
ignorance
not
knowing
what
might
be
the
power
of
a
husband
in
such
a
matter
and
partly
thinking
that
any
argument
would
be
good
and
fair
by
which
she
could
induce
her
sister
to
avoid
a
catastrophe
so
terrible
as
that
which
was
now
threatened
i
suppose
he
could
take
him
if
he
chose
she
said
at
last
i
do
believe
he
is
wicked
like
that
said
trevelyan
he
would
not
wish
to
kill
me
but
he
will
say
that
he
loves
baby
as
well
as
you
do
he
will
never
take
my
child
from
me
he
could
never
be
so
bad
as
that
and
you
will
never
be
so
bad
as
to
leave
him
said
nora
after
a
pause
i
will
not
believe
that
it
can
come
to
that
you
know
that
he
is
good
at
heart
that
nobody
on
earth
loves
you
as
he
does
so
they
went
on
for
two
days
and
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
there
came
a
letter
from
trevelyan
to
his
wife
they
had
neither
of
them
seen
him
although
he
had
been
in
and
out
of
the
house
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
sunday
a
new
grievance
a
very
terrible
grievance
was
added
to
those
which
trevelyan
was
made
to
bear
her
husband
had
told
one
of
the
servants
in
the
house
that
colonel
osborne
was
not
to
be
admitted
and
the
servant
to
whom
he
had
given
this
order
was
the
cook
there
is
no
reason
why
a
cook
should
be
less
trustworthy
in
such
a
matter
than
any
other
servant
and
in
trevelyan
household
there
was
a
reason
why
she
should
be
more
so
as
she
and
she
alone
was
what
we
generally
call
an
old
family
domestic
she
had
lived
with
her
master
mother
and
had
known
her
master
when
he
was
a
boy
looking
about
him
therefore
for
some
one
in
his
house
to
whom
he
could
speak
feeling
that
he
was
bound
to
convey
the
order
through
some
medium
he
called
to
him
the
ancient
cook
and
imparted
to
her
so
much
of
his
trouble
as
was
necessary
to
make
the
order
intelligible
this
he
did
with
various
assurances
to
prodgers
that
there
really
was
nothing
amiss
but
when
trevelyan
heard
what
had
been
done
which
she
did
from
prodgers
herself
prodgers
having
been
desired
by
her
master
to
make
the
communication
she
declared
to
her
sister
that
everything
was
now
over
she
could
never
again
live
with
a
husband
who
had
disgraced
his
wife
by
desiring
her
own
cook
to
keep
a
guard
upon
her
had
the
footman
been
instructed
not
to
admit
colonel
osborne
there
would
have
been
in
such
instruction
some
apparent
adherence
to
the
recognised
usages
of
society
if
you
do
not
desire
either
your
friend
or
your
enemy
to
be
received
into
your
house
you
communicate
your
desire
to
the
person
who
has
charge
of
the
door
but
the
cook
and
now
nora
if
it
were
you
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
would
remain
with
him
asked
trevelyan
nora
simply
replied
that
anything
under
any
circumstances
would
be
better
than
a
separation
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
there
came
the
following
letter
wednesday
june
midnight
dearest
emily
you
will
readily
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
never
in
my
life
was
so
wretched
as
i
have
been
during
the
last
two
days
that
you
and
i
should
be
in
the
same
house
together
and
not
able
to
speak
to
each
other
is
in
itself
a
misery
but
this
is
terribly
enhanced
by
the
dread
lest
this
state
of
things
should
be
made
to
continue
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
do
not
in
the
least
suspect
you
of
having
as
yet
done
anything
wrong
or
having
even
said
anything
injurious
either
to
my
position
as
your
husband
or
to
your
position
as
my
wife
but
i
can
not
but
perceive
that
you
are
allowing
yourself
to
be
entrapped
into
an
intimacy
with
colonel
osborne
which
if
it
be
not
checked
will
be
destructive
to
my
happiness
and
your
own
after
what
had
passed
before
you
can
not
have
thought
it
right
to
receive
letters
from
him
which
i
was
not
to
see
or
to
write
letters
to
him
of
which
i
was
not
to
know
the
contents
it
must
be
manifest
to
you
that
such
conduct
on
your
part
is
wrong
as
judged
by
any
of
the
rules
by
which
a
wife
conduct
can
be
measured
and
yet
you
have
refused
even
to
say
that
this
shall
be
discontinued
i
need
hardly
explain
to
you
that
if
you
persist
in
this
refusal
you
and
i
can
not
continue
to
live
together
as
man
and
wife
all
my
hopes
and
prospects
in
life
will
be
blighted
by
such
a
separation
i
have
not
as
yet
been
able
to
think
what
i
should
do
in
such
wretched
circumstances
and
for
you
as
also
for
nora
such
a
catastrophe
would
be
most
lamentable
do
therefore
think
of
it
well
and
write
me
such
a
letter
as
may
bring
me
back
to
your
side
there
is
only
one
friend
in
the
world
to
whom
i
could
endure
to
talk
of
this
great
grief
and
i
have
been
to
her
and
told
her
everything
you
will
know
that
i
mean
lady
milborough
after
much
difficult
conversation
i
have
persuaded
her
to
see
you
and
she
will
call
in
curzon
street
about
twelve
there
can
be
no
or
more
gentle
woman
in
the
world
than
lady
milborough
nor
did
any
one
ever
have
a
warmer
friend
than
both
you
and
i
have
in
her
let
me
implore
you
then
to
listen
to
her
and
be
guided
by
her
advice
pray
believe
dearest
emily
that
i
am
now
as
ever
your
most
affectionate
husband
and
that
i
have
no
wish
so
strong
as
that
we
should
not
be
compelled
to
part
louis
trevelyan
this
epistle
was
in
many
respects
a
very
injudicious
composition
trevelyan
should
have
trusted
either
to
the
eloquence
of
his
own
written
words
or
to
that
of
the
ambassador
whom
he
was
about
to
despatch
but
by
sending
both
he
weakened
both
and
then
there
were
certain
words
in
the
letter
which
were
odious
to
trevelyan
and
must
have
been
odious
to
any
young
wife
he
had
said
that
he
did
not
as
yet
suspect
her
of
having
done
anything
wrong
and
then
when
he
endeavoured
to
explain
to
her
that
a
separation
would
be
very
injurious
to
herself
he
had
coupled
her
sister
with
her
thus
seeming
to
imply
that
the
injury
to
be
avoided
was
of
a
material
kind
she
had
better
do
what
he
told
her
as
otherwise
she
and
her
sister
would
not
have
a
roof
over
their
head
that
was
the
nature
of
the
threat
which
his
words
were
supposed
to
convey
the
matter
had
become
so
serious
that
trevelyan
haughty
and
as
she
was
did
not
dare
to
abstain
from
showing
the
letter
to
her
sister
she
had
no
other
counsellor
at
any
rate
till
lady
milborough
came
and
the
weight
of
the
battle
was
too
great
for
her
own
unaided
spirit
the
letter
had
been
written
late
at
night
as
was
shown
by
the
precision
of
the
date
and
had
been
brought
to
her
early
in
the
morning
at
first
she
had
determined
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
nora
but
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
maintain
such
a
purpose
she
felt
that
she
needed
the
poor
consolation
of
discussing
her
wretchedness
she
first
declared
that
she
would
not
see
lady
milborough
i
hate
her
and
she
knows
that
i
hate
her
and
she
ought
not
to
have
thought
of
coming
said
trevelyan
but
she
was
at
last
beaten
out
of
this
purpose
by
nora
argument
that
all
the
world
would
be
against
her
if
she
refused
to
see
her
husband
old
friend
and
then
though
the
letter
was
an
odious
letter
as
she
declared
a
dozen
times
she
took
some
little
comfort
in
the
fact
that
not
a
word
was
said
in
it
about
the
baby
she
thought
that
if
she
could
take
her
child
with
her
into
any
separation
she
could
endure
it
and
her
husband
would
ultimately
be
conquered
yes
i
see
her
she
said
as
they
finished
the
discussion
as
he
chooses
to
send
her
i
suppose
i
had
better
see
her
but
i
think
he
does
much
to
mend
matters
when
he
sends
the
woman
whom
he
knows
i
dislike
more
than
any
other
in
all
london
exactly
at
twelve
lady
milborough
carriage
was
at
the
door
trevelyan
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
and
heard
the
knock
at
the
door
during
those
two
or
three
days
of
absolute
wretchedness
he
spent
most
of
his
hours
under
the
same
roof
with
his
wife
and
though
he
spoke
to
neither
of
them
he
had
had
his
doubts
as
to
the
reception
of
lady
milborough
and
was
to
tell
the
truth
listening
with
most
anxious
ear
when
her
ladyship
was
announced
his
wife
however
was
not
so
bitterly
contumacious
as
to
refuse
admittance
to
his
friend
and
he
heard
the
rustle
of
the
ponderous
silk
as
the
old
woman
was
shown
when
lady
milborough
reached
the
trevelyan
was
alone
i
had
better
see
her
by
myself
she
had
said
to
her
sister
nora
had
then
left
her
with
one
word
of
prayer
that
she
would
be
as
little
defiant
as
possible
that
must
depend
emily
had
said
with
a
little
shake
of
her
head
there
had
been
a
suggestion
that
the
child
should
be
with
her
but
the
mother
herself
had
rejected
this
it
would
be
stagey
she
had
said
and
there
is
nothing
i
hate
so
much
as
that
she
was
sitting
therefore
quite
alone
and
as
stiff
as
a
man
in
armour
when
lady
milborough
was
shown
up
to
her
and
lady
milborough
herself
was
not
at
all
comfortable
as
she
commenced
the
interview
she
had
prepared
many
wise
words
to
be
spoken
but
was
not
so
little
ignorant
of
the
character
of
the
woman
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
as
to
suppose
that
the
wise
words
would
get
themselves
spoken
without
interruption
she
had
known
from
the
first
that
trevelyan
would
have
much
to
say
for
herself
and
the
feeling
that
it
would
be
so
became
stronger
than
ever
as
she
entered
the
room
the
ordinary
feelings
between
the
two
ladies
were
cold
and
constrained
and
then
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
when
the
countess
had
taken
her
seat
trevelyan
had
quite
determined
that
the
enemy
should
fire
the
first
shot
this
is
a
very
sad
state
of
things
said
the
countess
yes
indeed
lady
milborough
the
saddest
in
the
world
and
so
unnecessary
is
it
not
very
unnecessary
indeed
as
i
think
yes
my
dear
yes
but
of
course
we
must
remember
then
lady
milborough
could
not
clearly
bring
to
her
mind
what
it
was
that
she
had
to
remember
the
fact
is
my
dear
that
all
this
kind
of
thing
is
too
monstrous
to
be
thought
of
goodness
gracious
me
two
young
people
like
you
and
louis
who
thoroughly
love
each
other
and
who
have
got
a
baby
to
think
of
being
separated
of
course
it
is
out
of
the
question
you
can
not
suppose
lady
milborough
that
i
want
to
be
separated
from
my
husband
of
course
not
how
should
it
be
possible
the
very
idea
is
too
shocking
to
be
thought
of
i
declare
i
have
slept
since
louis
was
talking
to
me
about
it
but
my
dear
you
must
remember
you
know
that
a
husband
has
a
right
to
expect
some
some
some
a
sort
of
submission
from
his
wife
he
has
a
right
to
expect
obedience
lady
milborough
of
course
that
is
all
one
wants
and
i
will
obey
trevelyan
in
anything
reasonable
but
my
dear
who
is
to
say
what
is
reasonable
that
you
see
is
always
the
difficulty
you
must
allow
that
your
husband
is
the
person
who
ought
to
decide
that
has
he
told
you
that
i
have
refused
to
obey
him
lady
milborough
the
countess
paused
a
moment
before
she
replied
well
yes
i
think
he
has
she
said
he
asked
you
to
do
something
about
a
letter
a
letter
to
that
colonel
osborne
who
is
a
man
my
dear
really
to
be
very
much
afraid
of
a
man
who
has
done
a
great
deal
of
harm
and
you
declined
now
in
a
matter
of
that
kind
of
course
the
husband
lady
milborough
i
must
ask
you
to
listen
to
me
you
have
listened
to
trevelyan
and
i
must
ask
you
to
listen
to
me
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
as
you
have
come
here
about
this
unpleasant
business
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
insist
upon
it
of
course
i
will
listen
to
you
my
dear
i
have
never
refused
to
obey
my
husband
and
i
do
not
refuse
now
the
gentleman
of
whom
you
have
been
speaking
is
an
old
friend
of
my
father
and
has
become
my
friend
nevertheless
had
trevelyan
given
me
any
plain
order
about
him
i
should
have
obeyed
him
a
wife
does
not
feel
that
her
chances
of
happiness
are
increased
when
she
finds
that
her
husband
suspects
her
of
being
too
intimate
with
another
man
it
is
a
thing
very
hard
to
bear
but
i
would
have
endeavoured
to
bear
it
knowing
how
important
it
is
for
both
our
sakes
and
more
especially
for
our
child
i
would
have
made
excuses
and
would
have
endeavoured
to
think
that
this
horrid
feeling
on
his
part
is
nothing
more
than
a
short
delusion
but
my
dear
i
must
ask
you
to
hear
me
out
lady
milborough
but
when
he
tells
me
first
that
i
am
not
to
meet
the
man
and
so
instructs
the
servants
then
tells
me
that
i
am
to
meet
him
and
go
on
just
as
i
was
going
before
and
then
again
tells
me
that
i
am
not
to
see
him
and
again
instructs
the
servants
and
above
all
the
cook
that
colonel
osborne
is
not
to
come
into
the
house
then
obedience
becomes
rather
difficult
just
say
now
that
you
will
do
what
he
wants
and
then
all
will
be
right
i
will
not
say
so
to
you
lady
milborough
it
is
not
to
you
that
i
ought
to
say
it
but
as
he
has
chosen
to
send
you
here
i
will
explain
to
you
that
i
have
never
disobeyed
him
when
i
was
free
in
accordance
with
trevelyan
wishes
to
have
what
intercourse
i
pleased
with
colonel
osborne
i
received
a
note
from
that
gentleman
on
a
most
trivial
matter
i
answered
it
as
trivially
my
husband
saw
my
letter
closed
and
questioned
me
about
it
i
told
him
that
the
letter
was
still
there
and
that
if
he
chose
to
be
a
spy
upon
my
actions
he
could
open
it
and
read
it
my
dear
how
could
you
bring
yourself
to
use
the
word
spy
to
your
husband
how
could
he
bring
himself
to
accuse
me
as
he
did
if
he
cares
for
me
let
him
come
and
beg
my
pardon
for
the
insult
he
has
offered
me
oh
trevelyan
yes
that
seems
very
wrong
to
you
who
have
not
had
to
bear
it
it
is
very
easy
for
a
stranger
to
take
a
husband
part
and
help
to
put
down
a
poor
woman
who
has
been
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
i
will
not
say
that
i
have
i
never
have
spoken
a
word
to
colonel
osborne
that
all
the
world
might
not
hear
nobody
has
accused
you
my
dear
yes
he
has
accused
me
and
you
have
accused
me
and
you
will
make
all
the
world
accuse
me
he
may
put
me
out
of
his
house
if
he
likes
but
he
shall
not
make
me
say
i
have
been
wrong
when
i
know
i
have
been
right
he
can
not
take
my
child
from
me
but
he
will
no
shouted
trevelyan
jumping
up
from
her
chair
no
he
shall
never
do
that
i
will
cling
to
him
so
that
he
can
not
separate
us
he
will
never
be
so
wicked
such
a
monster
as
that
i
would
go
about
the
world
saying
what
a
monster
he
had
been
to
me
the
passion
of
the
interview
was
becoming
too
great
for
lady
milborough
power
of
moderating
it
and
she
was
beginning
to
feel
herself
to
be
in
a
difficulty
lady
milborough
continued
trevelyan
tell
him
from
me
that
i
will
bear
anything
but
that
that
i
will
not
bear
dear
trevelyan
do
not
let
us
talk
about
it
who
wants
to
talk
about
it
why
do
you
come
here
and
threaten
me
with
a
thing
so
horrible
i
do
not
believe
you
he
would
not
dare
to
separate
me
and
my
child
but
you
have
only
to
say
that
you
will
submit
yourself
to
him
i
have
submitted
myself
to
him
and
i
will
submit
no
further
what
does
he
want
why
does
he
send
you
here
he
does
not
know
what
he
wants
he
has
made
himself
miserable
by
an
absurd
idea
and
he
wants
everybody
to
tell
him
that
he
has
been
right
he
has
been
very
wrong
and
if
he
desires
to
be
wise
now
he
will
come
back
to
his
home
and
say
nothing
further
about
it
he
will
gain
nothing
by
sending
messengers
here
lady
milborough
who
had
undertaken
a
most
disagreeable
task
from
the
purest
motives
of
old
friendship
did
not
like
being
called
a
messenger
but
the
woman
before
her
was
so
strong
in
her
words
so
eager
and
so
passionate
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
resent
the
injury
and
there
was
coming
over
her
an
idea
of
which
she
herself
was
hardly
conscious
that
after
all
perhaps
the
husband
was
not
in
the
right
she
had
come
there
with
the
general
idea
that
wives
and
especially
young
wives
should
be
submissive
she
had
naturally
taken
the
husband
part
and
having
a
preconceived
dislike
to
colonel
osborne
she
had
been
willing
enough
to
think
that
precautionary
measures
were
necessary
in
reference
to
so
eminent
and
notorious
and
experienced
a
lothario
she
had
never
altogether
loved
trevelyan
and
had
always
been
a
little
in
dread
of
her
but
she
had
thought
that
the
authority
with
which
she
would
be
invested
on
this
occasion
the
manifest
right
on
her
side
and
the
undeniable
truth
of
her
grand
argument
that
a
wife
should
obey
would
carry
her
if
not
easily
still
successfully
through
all
difficulties
it
was
probably
the
case
that
lady
milborough
when
preparing
for
her
visit
had
anticipated
a
triumph
but
when
she
had
been
closeted
for
an
hour
with
trevelyan
she
found
that
she
was
not
triumphant
she
was
told
that
she
was
a
messenger
and
an
unwelcome
messenger
and
she
began
to
feel
that
she
did
not
know
how
she
was
to
take
herself
away
i
am
sure
i
have
done
everything
for
the
best
she
said
getting
up
from
her
chair
the
best
will
be
to
send
him
back
and
make
him
feel
the
truth
the
best
for
you
my
dear
will
be
to
consider
well
what
should
be
the
duty
of
a
wife
i
have
considered
lady
milborough
it
can
not
be
a
wife
duty
to
acknowledge
that
she
has
been
wrong
in
such
a
matter
as
this
then
lady
milborough
made
her
curtsey
and
got
herself
away
in
some
manner
that
was
sufficiently
awkward
and
trevelyan
curtseyed
also
as
she
rang
the
bell
and
though
she
was
sore
and
wretched
and
in
truth
sadly
frightened
she
was
not
awkward
in
that
encounter
so
far
as
it
had
gone
she
had
been
the
victor
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
and
the
carriage
had
been
driven
well
away
from
the
door
trevelyan
left
the
and
went
up
to
the
nursery
as
she
entered
she
clothed
her
face
with
her
sweetest
smile
how
is
his
own
mother
dearest
dearest
darling
duck
she
said
putting
out
her
arms
and
taking
the
boy
from
the
nurse
the
child
was
at
this
time
about
ten
months
old
and
was
a
strong
hearty
happy
infant
always
laughing
when
he
was
awake
and
always
sleeping
when
he
did
not
laugh
because
his
little
limbs
were
free
from
pain
and
his
little
stomach
was
not
annoyed
by
internal
troubles
he
kicked
and
crowed
and
sputtered
when
his
mother
took
him
and
put
up
his
little
fingers
to
clutch
her
hair
and
was
to
her
as
a
young
god
upon
the
earth
nothing
in
the
world
had
ever
been
created
so
beautiful
so
joyous
so
satisfactory
so
divine
and
they
told
her
that
this
apple
of
her
eye
was
to
be
taken
away
from
her
no
that
must
be
impossible
i
will
take
him
into
my
own
room
nurse
for
a
little
while
you
have
had
him
all
the
morning
she
said
as
though
the
having
baby
was
a
privilege
over
which
there
might
almost
be
a
quarrel
then
she
took
her
boy
away
with
her
and
when
she
was
alone
with
him
went
through
such
a
service
in
as
most
mothers
will
understand
divide
these
two
no
nobody
should
do
that
sooner
than
that
she
the
mother
would
consent
to
be
no
more
than
a
servant
in
her
husband
house
was
not
her
baby
all
the
world
to
her
on
the
evening
of
that
day
the
husband
and
wife
had
an
interview
together
in
the
library
which
unfortunately
was
as
unsatisfactory
as
lady
milborough
visit
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
them
all
lay
probably
in
this
that
there
was
no
decided
point
which
if
conceded
would
have
brought
about
a
reconciliation
trevelyan
asked
for
general
submission
which
he
regarded
as
his
right
and
which
in
the
existing
circumstances
he
thought
it
necessary
to
claim
and
though
trevelyan
did
not
refuse
to
be
submissive
she
would
make
no
promise
on
the
subject
but
the
truth
was
that
each
desired
that
the
other
should
acknowledge
a
fault
and
that
neither
of
them
would
make
that
acknowledgment
emily
trevelyan
felt
acutely
that
she
had
been
not
only
by
her
husband
suspicion
but
by
the
manner
in
which
he
had
talked
of
his
suspicion
to
others
to
lady
milborough
and
the
cook
and
she
was
quite
convinced
that
she
was
right
herself
because
he
had
been
so
vacillating
in
his
conduct
about
colonel
osborne
but
trevelyan
was
equally
sure
that
justice
was
on
his
side
emily
must
have
known
his
real
wishes
about
colonel
osborne
but
when
she
had
found
that
he
had
rescinded
his
verbal
orders
about
the
admission
of
the
man
to
the
house
which
he
had
done
to
save
himself
and
her
from
slander
and
gossip
she
had
taken
advantage
of
this
and
had
thrown
herself
more
entirely
than
ever
into
the
intimacy
of
which
he
disapproved
when
they
met
each
was
so
sore
that
no
approach
to
terms
was
made
by
them
if
i
am
to
be
treated
in
that
way
i
would
rather
not
live
with
you
said
the
wife
it
is
impossible
to
live
with
a
husband
who
is
jealous
all
i
ask
of
you
is
that
you
shall
promise
me
to
have
no
further
communication
with
this
man
i
will
make
no
promise
that
implies
my
own
disgrace
then
we
must
part
and
if
that
be
so
this
house
will
be
given
up
you
may
live
where
you
please
in
the
country
not
in
london
but
i
shall
take
steps
that
colonel
osborne
does
not
see
you
i
will
not
remain
in
the
room
with
you
to
be
insulted
thus
said
trevelyan
and
she
did
not
remain
but
left
the
chamber
slamming
the
door
after
her
as
she
went
it
will
be
better
that
she
should
go
said
trevelyan
when
he
found
himself
alone
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
that
blessing
of
a
rich
marriage
which
had
as
it
were
fallen
upon
them
at
the
mandarins
from
out
of
heaven
had
become
after
an
interval
of
but
two
short
years
anything
but
an
unmixed
blessing
chapter
xii
miss
stanbury
generosity
on
one
wednesday
morning
early
in
june
great
preparations
were
being
made
at
the
brick
house
in
the
close
at
exeter
for
an
event
which
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
required
any
preparation
at
all
stanbury
and
her
elder
daughter
were
coming
into
exeter
from
nuncombe
putney
to
visit
dorothy
the
reader
may
perhaps
remember
that
when
miss
stanbury
invitation
was
sent
to
her
niece
she
was
pleased
to
promise
that
such
visits
should
be
permitted
on
a
wednesday
morning
such
a
visit
was
now
to
be
made
and
old
miss
stanbury
was
quite
moved
by
the
occasion
i
shall
not
see
them
you
know
martha
she
had
said
on
the
afternoon
of
the
preceding
day
i
suppose
not
certainly
not
why
should
i
it
would
do
no
good
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
of
course
no
martha
it
is
not
and
i
am
sure
that
i
am
right
it
no
good
going
back
and
undoing
in
ten
minutes
what
twenty
years
have
done
she
a
poor
harmless
creature
i
believe
the
most
harmless
in
the
world
but
she
was
as
bad
as
poison
to
me
when
she
was
young
and
the
good
of
trying
to
change
it
now
if
i
was
to
tell
her
that
i
loved
her
i
should
only
be
lying
then
i
would
not
say
it
and
i
do
mean
but
you
take
in
some
wine
and
cake
you
know
i
do
think
they
care
for
wine
and
cake
will
you
do
as
i
tell
you
what
matters
whether
they
care
for
it
or
not
they
need
not
take
it
it
will
look
better
for
miss
dorothy
if
dorothy
is
to
remain
here
i
shall
choose
that
she
should
be
respected
and
so
the
question
of
the
cake
and
wine
had
been
decided
overnight
but
when
the
morning
came
miss
stanbury
was
still
in
a
twitter
ten
had
been
the
hour
fixed
for
the
visit
in
consequence
of
there
being
a
train
in
from
lessboro
due
at
the
exeter
station
at
ten
as
miss
stanbury
breakfasted
always
at
eight
there
was
no
need
of
hurry
on
account
of
the
expected
visit
but
nevertheless
she
was
in
a
fuss
all
the
morning
and
spoke
of
the
coming
period
as
one
in
which
she
must
necessarily
put
herself
into
solitary
confinement
perhaps
your
mamma
will
be
cold
she
said
and
will
expect
a
fire
oh
dear
no
aunt
stanbury
it
could
be
lighted
of
course
it
is
a
pity
they
should
come
just
so
as
to
prevent
you
from
going
to
morning
service
is
it
not
i
could
go
with
you
aunt
and
be
back
very
nearly
in
time
they
wo
mind
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
what
and
have
them
here
all
alone
i
would
think
of
such
a
thing
i
shall
go
you
had
better
come
to
me
when
they
are
gone
do
hurry
them
i
do
want
you
to
hurry
them
at
all
and
if
you
require
anything
martha
will
wait
upon
you
i
have
told
the
girls
to
keep
out
of
the
way
they
are
so
giddy
there
no
knowing
what
they
might
be
after
besides
they
got
their
work
to
mind
all
this
was
very
terrible
to
poor
dorothy
who
had
not
as
yet
quite
recovered
from
the
original
fear
with
which
her
aunt
had
inspired
her
so
terrible
that
she
was
almost
sorry
that
her
mother
and
sister
were
coming
to
her
when
the
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
precisely
as
the
cathedral
clock
was
striking
ten
to
secure
which
punctuality
and
thereby
not
to
offend
the
owner
of
the
mansion
stanbury
and
priscilla
had
been
walking
about
the
close
for
the
last
ten
minutes
miss
stanbury
was
still
in
the
parlour
there
they
are
she
exclaimed
jumping
up
they
have
given
a
body
much
time
to
run
away
have
they
my
dear
half
a
minute
martha
just
half
a
minute
then
she
gathered
up
her
things
as
though
she
had
been
in
being
driven
to
make
so
sudden
a
retreat
and
martha
as
soon
as
the
last
hem
of
her
mistress
dress
had
become
invisible
on
the
stairs
opened
the
front
door
for
the
visitors
do
you
mean
to
say
you
like
it
said
priscilla
when
they
had
been
there
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
h
u
sh
whispered
stanbury
i
do
suppose
she
listening
at
the
door
said
priscilla
indeed
she
not
said
dorothy
there
ca
be
a
truer
honester
woman
than
aunt
stanbury
but
is
she
kind
to
you
dolly
asked
the
mother
very
kind
too
kind
only
i
do
understand
her
quite
and
then
she
gets
angry
with
me
i
know
she
thinks
i
a
fool
and
that
the
worst
of
it
then
if
i
were
you
i
would
come
home
said
priscilla
she
never
forgive
you
if
you
do
said
stanbury
and
who
need
care
about
her
forgiveness
said
priscilla
i
do
mean
to
go
home
yet
at
any
rate
said
dorothy
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
martha
entered
with
the
cake
and
wine
miss
stanbury
compliments
ladies
and
she
hopes
you
take
a
glass
of
sherry
whereupon
she
filled
out
the
glasses
and
carried
them
round
pray
give
my
compliments
and
thanks
to
my
sister
stanbury
said
dorothy
mother
but
priscilla
put
down
the
glass
of
wine
without
touching
it
and
looked
her
sternest
at
the
maid
altogether
the
visit
was
not
very
successful
and
poor
dorothy
almost
felt
that
if
she
chose
to
remain
in
the
close
she
must
lose
her
mother
and
sister
and
that
without
really
making
a
friend
of
her
aunt
there
had
as
yet
been
no
quarrel
nothing
that
had
been
plainly
recognised
as
disagreeable
but
there
had
not
as
yet
come
to
be
any
sympathy
or
assured
signs
of
comfortable
love
miss
stanbury
had
declared
more
than
once
that
it
would
do
but
had
not
succeeded
in
showing
in
what
the
success
consisted
when
she
was
told
that
the
two
ladies
were
gone
she
desired
that
dorothy
might
be
sent
to
her
and
immediately
began
to
make
anxious
inquiries
well
my
dear
and
what
do
they
think
of
it
i
do
know
aunt
that
they
think
very
much
and
what
do
they
say
about
it
they
did
say
very
much
aunt
i
was
very
glad
to
see
mamma
and
priscilla
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
mamma
gave
me
back
the
money
i
sent
her
what
did
she
do
that
for
asked
miss
stanbury
very
sharply
because
she
says
that
hugh
sends
her
now
what
she
wants
miss
stanbury
when
she
heard
this
looked
very
sour
i
thought
it
best
to
tell
you
you
know
it
will
never
come
to
any
good
got
in
that
way
never
but
aunt
stanbury
is
it
good
of
him
to
send
it
i
do
know
i
suppose
it
better
than
drinking
and
smoking
and
gambling
but
i
dare
say
he
gets
enough
for
that
too
when
a
man
born
and
bred
like
a
gentleman
condescends
to
let
out
his
talents
and
education
for
such
purposes
i
dare
say
they
are
willing
enough
to
pay
him
the
devil
always
does
pay
high
wages
but
that
only
makes
it
so
much
the
worse
one
almost
comes
to
doubt
whether
any
one
ought
to
learn
to
write
at
all
when
it
is
used
for
such
vile
purposes
i
said
what
i
got
to
say
and
i
do
mean
to
say
anything
more
what
the
use
but
it
has
been
hard
upon
me
very
it
was
my
money
did
it
and
i
feel
i
misused
it
it
a
disgrace
to
me
which
i
do
deserve
for
a
couple
of
minutes
dorothy
remained
quite
silent
and
miss
stanbury
did
not
herself
say
anything
further
nor
during
that
time
did
she
observe
her
niece
or
she
would
probably
have
seen
that
the
subject
was
not
to
be
dropped
dorothy
though
she
was
silent
was
not
calm
and
was
preparing
herself
for
a
crusade
in
her
defence
aunt
stanbury
he
my
brother
you
know
of
course
he
your
brother
i
wish
he
were
not
i
think
him
the
best
brother
in
the
world
and
the
best
son
why
does
he
sell
himself
to
write
sedition
he
does
sell
himself
to
write
sedition
i
do
see
why
it
should
be
sedition
or
anything
wicked
because
it
sold
for
a
penny
if
you
are
going
to
cram
him
down
my
throat
dorothy
you
and
i
had
better
part
i
do
want
to
say
anything
about
him
only
you
ought
not
to
abuse
him
before
me
by
this
time
dorothy
was
beginning
to
sob
but
miss
stanbury
countenance
was
still
very
grim
and
very
stern
he
coming
home
to
nuncombe
putney
and
i
want
to
see
see
him
continued
dorothy
hugh
stanbury
coming
to
exeter
he
wo
come
here
then
i
rather
go
home
aunt
stanbury
very
well
very
well
said
miss
stanbury
and
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
dorothy
was
in
dismay
and
began
to
think
that
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
but
to
pack
up
her
clothes
and
prepare
for
her
departure
she
was
very
sorry
for
what
had
occurred
being
fully
alive
to
the
importance
of
the
aid
not
only
to
herself
but
to
her
mother
and
sister
which
was
afforded
by
the
present
arrangement
and
she
felt
very
angry
with
herself
in
that
she
had
already
driven
her
aunt
to
quarrel
with
her
but
she
had
found
it
to
be
impossible
to
hear
her
own
brother
abused
without
saying
a
word
on
his
behalf
she
did
not
see
her
aunt
again
till
and
then
there
was
hardly
a
word
uttered
once
or
twice
dorothy
made
a
little
effort
to
speak
but
these
attempts
failed
utterly
the
old
woman
would
hardly
reply
even
by
a
monosyllable
but
simply
muttered
something
or
shook
her
head
when
she
was
addressed
jane
who
waited
at
table
was
very
demure
and
silent
and
martha
who
once
came
into
the
room
during
the
meal
merely
whispered
a
word
into
miss
stanbury
ear
when
the
cloth
was
removed
and
two
glasses
of
port
had
been
poured
out
by
miss
stanbury
herself
dorothy
felt
that
she
could
endure
this
treatment
no
longer
how
was
it
possible
that
she
could
drink
wine
under
such
circumstances
illustration
aunt
stanbury
at
dinner
will
not
speak
not
for
me
aunt
stanbury
said
she
with
a
deploring
tone
why
not
i
could
drink
it
why
did
you
say
so
before
it
was
poured
out
and
why
not
come
drink
it
do
as
i
bid
you
and
she
stood
over
her
niece
as
a
tragedy
queen
in
a
play
with
a
bowl
of
poison
dorothy
took
it
and
sipped
it
from
mere
force
of
obedience
you
make
as
many
bones
about
a
glass
of
port
wine
as
though
it
were
senna
and
salts
said
miss
stanbury
now
i
got
something
to
say
to
you
by
this
time
the
servant
was
gone
and
the
two
were
seated
alone
together
in
the
parlour
dorothy
who
had
not
as
yet
swallowed
above
half
her
wine
at
once
put
the
glass
down
there
was
an
importance
in
her
tone
which
frightened
her
and
made
her
feel
that
some
evil
was
coming
and
yet
as
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
must
return
home
there
was
no
further
evil
that
she
need
dread
you
write
any
of
those
horrid
articles
said
miss
stanbury
no
aunt
i
did
write
them
i
should
know
how
and
i
hope
you
never
learn
they
say
women
are
to
vote
and
become
doctors
and
if
so
there
no
knowing
what
devil
tricks
they
may
do
but
it
is
your
fault
about
that
filthy
newspaper
how
he
can
let
himself
down
to
write
stuff
that
is
to
be
printed
on
straw
is
what
i
ca
understand
i
do
see
how
it
can
make
a
difference
as
he
writes
it
it
would
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
me
and
i
told
that
what
they
call
ink
comes
off
on
your
fingers
like
i
never
touched
one
thank
god
but
they
tell
me
so
all
the
same
it
your
fault
i
nothing
to
do
with
it
aunt
stanbury
of
course
you
not
and
as
he
is
your
brother
it
would
be
natural
that
you
should
like
to
throw
him
off
and
my
dear
i
like
you
for
taking
his
part
only
you
need
have
been
so
fierce
with
an
old
woman
indeed
indeed
i
did
mean
to
be
fierce
aunt
stanbury
i
never
was
taken
up
so
short
in
my
life
but
we
wo
mind
that
there
he
shall
come
and
see
you
i
suppose
he
wo
insist
on
leaving
any
of
his
nastiness
about
but
is
he
to
come
here
aunt
stanbury
he
may
if
he
pleases
oh
aunt
stanbury
when
he
was
here
last
he
generally
had
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
i
dare
say
he
never
puts
it
down
at
all
now
those
things
grow
upon
young
people
so
fast
but
if
he
could
leave
it
on
the
just
while
he
here
i
should
be
obliged
to
him
but
dear
aunt
could
i
see
him
in
the
street
out
in
the
street
no
my
dear
all
the
world
is
not
to
know
that
he
your
brother
and
he
is
dressed
in
such
a
rapscallion
manner
that
the
people
would
think
you
were
talking
to
a
dorothy
face
became
again
red
as
she
heard
this
and
the
angry
words
were
very
nearly
spoken
the
last
time
i
saw
him
continued
miss
stanbury
he
had
on
a
short
rough
jacket
with
enormous
buttons
and
one
of
those
things
on
his
head
that
the
wear
and
oh
the
smell
of
tobacco
as
he
had
been
up
in
london
i
suppose
he
thought
exeter
was
no
better
than
a
village
and
he
might
do
just
as
he
pleased
but
he
knew
that
if
i
particular
about
anything
it
is
about
a
gentleman
hat
in
the
streets
and
he
wanted
me
me
to
walk
with
him
across
to
machugh
we
should
have
been
hooted
about
the
close
like
a
pair
of
mad
dogs
and
so
i
told
him
all
the
young
men
seem
to
dress
like
that
now
aunt
stanbury
no
they
do
gibson
does
dress
like
that
but
he
a
clergyman
aunt
stanbury
perhaps
i
an
old
fool
i
dare
say
i
am
and
of
course
that
what
you
mean
at
any
rate
i
too
old
to
change
and
i
do
mean
to
try
i
like
to
see
a
difference
between
a
gentleman
and
a
for
the
matter
of
that
i
told
that
there
is
a
difference
and
that
the
all
look
like
gentlemen
now
it
may
be
proper
to
make
us
all
stand
on
our
heads
with
our
legs
sticking
up
in
the
air
but
i
for
one
do
like
being
and
i
wo
try
it
when
is
he
to
reach
exeter
he
is
coming
on
tuesday
next
by
the
last
train
then
you
ca
see
him
that
night
that
out
of
the
question
no
doubt
he
sleep
at
the
nag
head
as
that
the
lowest
radical
in
the
city
martha
shall
try
to
find
him
she
knows
more
about
his
doings
than
i
do
if
he
chooses
to
come
here
the
following
morning
before
he
goes
down
to
nuncombe
putney
well
and
good
i
shall
wait
up
till
martha
comes
back
from
the
train
on
tuesday
night
and
hear
dorothy
was
of
course
full
of
gratitude
and
thanks
but
yet
she
felt
almost
disappointed
by
the
result
of
her
aunt
clemency
on
the
matter
she
had
desired
to
take
her
part
and
it
had
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
had
done
so
in
a
very
lukewarm
manner
she
had
listened
to
an
immense
number
of
accusations
against
him
and
had
been
unable
to
reply
to
them
because
she
had
been
conquered
by
the
promise
of
a
visit
and
now
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
speak
of
going
her
aunt
had
given
way
to
her
and
of
course
had
conquered
her
late
on
the
tuesday
evening
after
ten
hugh
stanbury
was
walking
round
the
close
with
his
aunt
old
servant
he
had
not
put
up
at
that
dreadfully
radical
establishment
of
which
miss
stanbury
was
so
much
afraid
but
had
taken
a
at
the
railway
inn
from
there
he
had
walked
up
to
the
close
with
martha
and
now
was
having
a
few
last
words
with
her
before
he
would
allow
her
to
return
to
the
house
i
suppose
she
as
soon
see
the
devil
as
see
me
said
hugh
if
you
speak
in
that
way
hugh
i
wo
listen
to
you
and
yet
i
did
everything
i
could
to
please
her
and
i
do
think
any
boy
ever
loved
an
old
woman
better
than
i
did
her
that
was
while
she
used
to
send
you
cakes
and
ham
and
jam
to
school
mr
hugh
of
course
it
was
and
while
she
sent
me
flannel
waistcoats
to
oxford
but
when
i
did
care
any
longer
for
cakes
or
flannel
then
she
got
tired
of
me
it
is
much
better
as
it
is
if
she
only
be
good
to
dorothy
she
never
was
bad
to
anybody
hugh
but
i
do
think
an
old
lady
like
her
ever
takes
to
a
young
woman
as
she
does
to
a
young
man
if
only
he
let
her
have
a
little
more
of
her
own
way
than
you
would
it
my
belief
that
you
might
have
had
it
all
for
your
own
some
day
if
you
done
as
you
ought
that
nonsense
martha
she
means
to
leave
it
all
to
the
burgesses
i
heard
her
say
so
say
so
yes
people
do
always
do
what
they
say
if
you
managed
rightly
you
might
have
it
all
and
so
you
might
now
i
tell
you
what
old
girl
i
sha
try
live
for
the
next
twenty
years
under
her
apron
strings
that
i
may
have
the
chance
at
the
end
of
it
of
cutting
some
poor
devil
out
of
his
money
do
you
know
the
meaning
of
making
a
score
off
your
own
bat
martha
no
i
do
and
if
it
anything
you
like
to
do
i
do
think
i
should
be
the
better
for
learning
by
all
accounts
and
now
if
you
please
i
go
in
good
night
martha
my
love
to
them
both
and
say
i
be
there
exactly
at
nine
you
better
take
it
it
turn
to
it
has
come
from
the
old
gentleman
i
do
want
anything
of
that
kind
hugh
indeed
i
do
nonsense
if
you
do
take
it
you
offend
me
i
believe
you
think
i
not
much
better
than
a
schoolboy
still
i
do
think
you
half
so
good
hugh
said
the
old
servant
sticking
the
sovereign
which
hugh
had
given
her
in
under
her
glove
as
she
spoke
on
the
next
morning
that
other
visit
was
made
at
the
brick
house
and
miss
stanbury
was
again
in
a
fuss
on
this
occasion
however
she
was
in
a
much
better
humour
than
before
and
was
full
of
little
jokes
as
to
the
nature
of
the
visitation
of
course
she
was
not
to
see
her
nephew
herself
and
no
message
was
to
be
delivered
from
her
and
none
was
to
be
given
to
her
from
him
but
an
accurate
report
was
to
be
made
to
her
as
to
his
appearance
and
dorothy
was
to
be
enabled
to
answer
a
variety
of
questions
respecting
him
after
he
was
gone
of
course
i
do
want
to
know
anything
about
his
money
miss
stanbury
said
only
i
should
like
to
know
how
much
these
people
can
afford
to
pay
for
their
penny
trash
on
this
occasion
she
had
left
the
room
and
gone
before
the
knock
came
at
the
door
but
she
managed
by
peeping
over
the
balcony
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
hat
which
her
nephew
certainly
had
with
him
on
this
occasion
hugh
stanbury
had
great
news
for
his
sister
the
cottage
in
which
stanbury
lived
at
nuncombe
putney
was
the
tiniest
little
dwelling
in
which
a
lady
and
her
two
daughters
ever
sheltered
themselves
there
was
indeed
a
two
and
a
kitchen
but
they
were
all
so
diminutive
in
size
that
the
cottage
was
little
more
than
a
cabin
but
there
was
a
house
in
the
village
not
large
indeed
but
eminently
respectable
three
stories
high
covered
with
ivy
having
a
garden
behind
it
and
generally
called
the
clock
house
because
there
had
once
been
a
clock
upon
it
this
house
had
been
lately
vacated
and
hugh
informed
his
sister
that
he
was
thinking
of
taking
it
for
his
mother
accommodation
now
the
late
occupants
of
the
clock
house
at
nuncombe
putney
had
been
people
with
five
or
six
hundred
a
year
had
other
matters
been
in
accordance
the
house
would
almost
have
entitled
them
to
consider
themselves
as
county
people
a
gardener
had
always
been
kept
there
and
a
cow
the
clock
house
for
mamma
well
yes
do
say
a
word
about
it
as
yet
to
aunt
stanbury
as
she
think
that
i
sold
myself
altogether
to
the
old
gentleman
but
hugh
how
can
mamma
live
there
the
fact
is
dorothy
there
is
a
secret
i
ca
tell
you
quite
yet
of
course
you
know
it
and
everybody
will
know
it
if
the
thing
comes
about
but
as
you
wo
talk
i
will
tell
you
what
most
concerns

chapter

the
honourable
glascock
illustration
by
the
end
of
july
trevelyan
with
her
sister
was
established
in
the
clock
house
at
nuncombe
putney
under
the
protection
of
mother
but
before
the
reader
is
made
acquainted
with
any
of
the
circumstances
of
their
life
there
a
few
words
must
be
said
of
an
occurrence
which
took
place
before
those
two
ladies
left
curzon
street
as
to
the
quarrel
between
trevelyan
and
his
wife
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
lady
milborough
continued
to
interfere
writing
letters
to
emily
which
were
full
of
good
sense
but
which
as
emily
said
herself
never
really
touched
the
point
of
dispute
am
i
who
am
altogether
unconscious
of
having
done
anything
amiss
to
confess
that
i
have
been
in
the
wrong
if
it
were
about
a
small
matter
i
would
not
mind
for
the
sake
of
peace
but
when
it
concerns
my
conduct
in
reference
to
another
man
i
would
rather
die
first
that
had
been
trevelyan
line
of
thought
and
argument
in
the
matter
but
then
old
lady
milborough
in
her
letters
spoke
only
of
the
duty
of
obedience
as
promised
at
the
altar
but
i
did
promise
to
tell
a
lie
said
trevelyan
and
there
were
interviews
between
lady
milborough
and
trevelyan
and
interviews
between
lady
milborough
and
nora
rowley
the
poor
dear
old
dowager
was
exceedingly
busy
and
full
of
groans
prescribing
naples
prescribing
a
course
of
extra
prayers
prescribing
a
general
course
of
letting
be
to
which
however
trevelyan
would
by
no
means
assent
without
some
assurance
which
he
might
regard
as
a
guarantee
prescribing
retirement
to
a
small
town
in
the
west
of
france
if
naples
would
not
suffice
but
she
could
effect
nothing
trevelyan
indeed
did
a
thing
which
was
sure
of
itself
to
render
any
steps
taken
for
a
reconciliation
ineffectual
in
the
midst
of
all
this
turmoil
while
she
and
her
husband
were
still
living
in
the
same
house
but
apart
because
of
their
absurd
quarrel
respecting
colonel
osborne
she
wrote
another
letter
to
that
gentleman
the
argument
by
which
she
justified
this
to
herself
and
to
her
sister
after
it
was
done
was
the
real
propriety
of
her
own
conduct
throughout
her
whole
intimacy
with
colonel
osborne
but
that
is
just
what
louis
does
want
you
to
do
nora
had
said
filled
with
anger
and
dismay
then
let
louis
give
me
an
order
to
that
effect
and
behave
to
me
like
a
husband
and
i
will
obey
him
emily
had
answered
and
she
had
gone
on
to
plead
that
in
her
present
condition
she
was
under
no
orders
from
her
husband
she
was
left
to
judge
for
herself
and
judging
for
herself
she
knew
as
she
said
that
it
was
best
that
she
should
write
to
colonel
osborne
unfortunately
there
was
no
ground
for
hoping
that
colonel
osborne
was
ignorant
of
this
insane
jealousy
on
the
part
of
her
husband
it
was
better
therefore
she
said
that
she
should
write
to
him
whom
on
the
occasion
she
took
care
to
name
to
her
sister
as
papa
old
friend
and
explain
to
him
what
she
would
wish
him
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
colonel
osborne
answered
the
letter
very
quickly
throwing
much
more
of
demonstrative
affection
than
he
should
have
done
into
his
dear
emily
and
his
dearest
friend
of
course
trevelyan
had
burned
this
answer
and
of
course
trevelyan
had
been
told
of
the
correspondence
his
wife
indeed
had
been
especially
careful
that
there
should
be
nothing
secret
about
the
matter
that
it
should
be
so
known
in
the
house
that
trevelyan
should
be
sure
to
hear
of
it
and
he
had
heard
of
it
and
been
driven
almost
mad
by
it
he
had
flown
off
to
lady
milborough
and
had
reduced
his
old
friend
to
despair
by
declaring
that
after
all
he
began
to
fear
that
his
wife
was
was
was
infatuated
by
that
d
scoundrel
lady
milborough
forgave
the
language
but
protested
that
he
was
wrong
in
his
suspicion
to
continue
to
correspond
with
him
after
what
i
have
said
to
her
exclaimed
trevelyan
take
her
to
naples
at
once
said
lady
milborough
at
once
and
have
him
after
me
said
trevelyan
lady
milborough
had
no
answer
ready
and
not
having
thought
of
this
looked
very
blank
i
should
find
it
harder
to
deal
with
her
there
even
than
here
continued
trevelyan
then
it
was
that
lady
milborough
spoke
of
the
small
town
in
the
west
of
france
urging
as
her
reason
that
such
a
man
as
colonel
osborne
would
certainly
not
follow
them
there
but
trevelyan
had
become
indignant
at
this
declaring
that
if
his
wife
good
name
could
be
preserved
in
no
other
manner
than
that
it
would
not
be
worth
preserving
at
all
then
lady
milborough
had
begun
to
cry
and
had
continued
crying
for
a
very
long
time
she
was
very
unhappy
as
unhappy
as
her
nature
would
allow
her
to
be
she
would
have
made
almost
any
sacrifice
to
bring
the
two
young
people
together
would
have
willingly
given
her
time
her
money
her
labour
in
the
cause
would
probably
herself
have
gone
to
the
little
town
in
the
west
of
france
had
her
going
been
of
any
service
but
nevertheless
after
her
own
fashion
she
extracted
no
small
enjoyment
out
of
the
circumstances
of
this
miserable
quarrel
the
lady
milboroughs
of
the
day
hate
the
colonel
osbornes
from
the
very
bottoms
of
their
warm
hearts
and
pure
souls
but
they
respect
the
colonel
osbornes
almost
as
much
as
they
hate
them
and
find
it
to
be
an
inestimable
privilege
to
be
brought
into
some
contact
with
these
roaring
lions
but
there
arose
to
dear
lady
milborough
a
great
trouble
out
of
this
quarrel
irrespective
of
the
absolute
horror
of
the
separation
of
a
young
husband
from
his
young
wife
and
the
excess
of
her
trouble
on
this
head
was
great
proof
of
the
real
goodness
of
her
heart
for
in
this
matter
the
welfare
of
trevelyan
himself
was
not
concerned
but
rather
that
of
the
rowley
family
now
the
rowleys
had
not
given
lady
milborough
any
special
reason
for
loving
them
when
she
had
first
heard
that
her
dear
young
friend
louis
was
going
to
marry
a
girl
from
the
mandarins
she
had
been
almost
in
despair
it
was
her
opinion
that
had
he
properly
understood
his
own
position
he
would
have
promoted
his
welfare
by
falling
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
some
english
country
gentleman
or
some
english
peer
to
which
honour
with
his
advantages
lady
milborough
thought
that
he
might
have
aspired
nevertheless
when
the
girl
from
the
mandarins
had
been
brought
home
as
trevelyan
lady
milborough
had
received
her
with
open
arms
had
received
even
the
with
arms
partly
open
had
either
of
them
shown
any
tendency
to
regard
her
as
a
mother
she
would
have
showered
motherly
cares
upon
them
for
lady
milborough
was
like
an
old
hen
in
her
capacity
for
taking
many
under
her
wings
the
two
sisters
had
hardly
done
more
than
bear
with
her
nora
indeed
bearing
with
her
more
graciously
than
trevelyan
and
in
return
even
for
this
the
old
dowager
was
full
of
motherly
regard
now
she
knew
well
that
glascock
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
nora
rowley
it
only
wanted
the
slightest
management
and
the
easiest
discretion
to
bring
him
on
his
knees
with
an
offer
of
his
hand
and
then
how
much
that
hand
contained
how
much
indeed
as
compared
with
that
other
hand
which
was
to
be
given
in
return
and
which
was
to
speak
the
truth
completely
empty
glascock
was
the
heir
to
a
peer
was
the
heir
to
a
rich
peer
was
the
heir
to
a
very
very
old
peer
he
was
in
parliament
the
world
spoke
well
of
him
he
was
not
so
to
say
by
any
means
an
old
man
himself
he
was
reasonable
easily
led
and
yet
by
no
means
despicable
on
all
subjects
connected
with
land
he
held
an
opinion
that
was
very
much
respected
and
was
supposed
to
be
a
thoroughly
good
specimen
of
an
englishman
here
was
a
suitor
but
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
such
a
man
as
glascock
would
be
so
violently
in
love
as
to
propose
to
a
girl
whose
nearest
known
friend
and
female
relation
was
misbehaving
herself
only
they
who
have
closely
watched
the
natural
uneasiness
of
human
hens
can
understand
how
great
was
lady
milborough
anxiety
on
this
occasion
marriage
to
her
was
a
thing
always
delightful
to
contemplate
though
she
had
never
been
sordidly
a
the
course
of
the
world
around
her
had
taught
her
to
regard
men
as
fish
to
be
caught
and
girls
as
the
anglers
who
ought
to
catch
them
or
rather
could
her
mind
have
been
accurately
analysed
it
would
have
been
found
that
the
girl
was
regarded
as
and
any
girl
that
angled
visibly
with
her
own
hook
with
a
manifestly
expressed
desire
to
catch
a
fish
was
odious
to
her
and
she
was
very
in
regard
to
the
fishes
thinking
that
every
fish
in
the
river
should
have
the
hook
and
bait
presented
to
him
in
the
mildest
pleasantest
form
but
still
when
the
trout
was
well
in
the
basket
her
joy
was
great
and
then
came
across
her
unlaborious
mind
some
idea
that
a
great
ordinance
of
nature
was
being
accomplished
in
the
teeth
of
difficulties
for
as
she
well
knew
there
is
a
difficulty
in
the
catching
of
fish
lady
milborough
in
her
kind
anxiety
on
nora
behalf
that
the
fish
should
be
landed
before
nora
might
be
swept
away
in
her
ruin
hardly
knew
what
step
she
might
safely
take
trevelyan
would
not
see
her
again
having
already
declared
that
any
further
interview
would
be
painful
and
useless
she
had
spoken
to
trevelyan
but
trevelyan
had
declared
that
he
could
do
nothing
what
was
there
that
he
could
have
done
he
could
not
as
he
said
overlook
the
gross
improprieties
of
his
wife
conduct
because
his
wife
sister
had
or
might
possibly
have
a
lover
and
then
as
to
speaking
to
glascock
himself
nobody
knew
better
than
lady
milborough
how
very
apt
fish
are
to
be
frightened
but
at
last
lady
milborough
did
speak
to
glascock
making
no
allusion
whatever
to
the
hook
prepared
for
himself
but
saying
a
word
or
two
as
to
the
affairs
of
that
other
fish
whose
circumstances
as
he
floundered
about
in
the
bucket
of
matrimony
were
not
as
happy
as
they
might
have
been
the
care
the
discretion
nay
the
wisdom
with
which
she
did
this
were
most
excellent
she
had
become
aware
that
glascock
had
already
heard
of
the
unfortunate
affair
in
curzon
street
indeed
every
one
who
knew
the
trevelyans
had
heard
of
it
and
a
great
many
who
did
not
know
them
no
harm
therefore
could
be
done
by
mentioning
the
circumstance
lady
milborough
did
mention
it
explaining
that
the
only
person
really
in
fault
was
that
odious
destroyer
of
the
peace
of
families
colonel
osborne
of
whom
lady
milborough
on
that
occasion
said
some
very
severe
things
indeed
poor
dear
trevelyan
was
foolish
obstinate
and
but
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
that
things
would
come
right
before
long
no
one
who
knew
the
affair
and
she
knew
it
from
beginning
to
end
could
for
a
moment
doubt
the
real
victim
would
be
that
sweetest
of
all
girls
nora
rowley
glascock
innocently
asked
why
nora
rowley
should
be
a
victim
do
you
understand
glascock
how
the
most
remote
connection
with
a
thing
of
that
kind
tarnishes
a
young
woman
standing
in
the
world
glascock
was
almost
angry
with
the
countess
as
he
declared
that
he
could
not
see
that
miss
rowley
standing
was
at
all
tarnished
and
old
lady
milborough
when
he
got
up
and
left
her
felt
that
she
had
done
a
good
morning
work
if
nora
could
have
known
it
all
nora
ought
to
have
been
very
grateful
for
glascock
got
into
a
cab
in
eccleston
square
and
had
himself
driven
direct
to
curzon
street
he
himself
believed
that
he
was
at
that
moment
only
doing
the
thing
which
he
had
for
some
time
past
resolved
that
he
would
do
but
we
perhaps
may
be
justified
in
thinking
that
the
actual
resolution
was
first
fixed
by
the
discretion
of
lady
milborough
communication
at
any
rate
he
arrived
in
curzon
street
with
his
mind
fully
resolved
and
had
spent
the
minutes
in
the
cab
considering
how
he
had
better
perform
the
business
in
hand
he
was
at
once
shown
into
the
where
he
found
the
two
sisters
and
trevelyan
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
understood
the
purpose
of
his
coming
there
was
an
air
of
determination
about
him
a
manifest
intention
of
doing
something
an
absence
of
that
vagueness
which
almost
always
flavours
a
morning
visit
this
was
so
strongly
marked
that
trevelyan
felt
that
she
would
have
been
almost
justified
in
getting
up
and
declaring
that
as
this
visit
was
paid
to
her
sister
she
would
retire
but
any
such
declaration
on
her
part
was
unnecessary
as
glascock
had
not
been
in
the
room
three
minutes
before
he
asked
her
to
go
by
some
clever
device
of
his
own
he
got
her
into
the
back
room
and
whispered
to
her
that
he
wanted
to
say
a
few
words
in
private
to
her
sister
oh
certainly
said
trevelyan
smiling
i
dare
say
you
may
guess
what
they
are
said
he
i
do
know
what
chance
i
may
have
i
can
tell
you
nothing
about
that
she
replied
as
i
know
nothing
but
you
have
my
good
wishes
and
then
she
went
it
may
be
presumed
that
gradually
some
idea
of
intention
had
made
its
way
into
nora
mind
by
the
time
that
she
found
herself
alone
with
that
gentleman
why
else
had
he
brought
into
the
room
with
him
that
manifest
air
of
a
purpose
why
else
had
he
taken
the
very
strong
step
of
sending
the
lady
of
the
house
out
of
her
own
nora
beginning
to
understand
this
put
herself
into
an
attitude
of
defence
she
had
never
told
herself
that
she
would
refuse
glascock
she
had
never
acknowledged
to
herself
that
there
was
another
man
whom
she
liked
better
than
she
liked
glascock
but
had
she
ever
encouraged
any
wish
for
such
an
interview
her
feelings
at
this
moment
would
have
been
very
different
from
what
they
were
as
it
was
she
would
have
given
much
to
postpone
it
so
that
she
might
have
asked
herself
questions
and
have
discovered
whether
she
could
reconcile
herself
to
do
that
which
no
doubt
all
her
friends
would
commend
her
for
doing
of
course
it
was
clear
enough
to
the
mind
of
the
girl
that
she
had
her
fortune
to
make
and
that
her
beauty
and
youth
were
the
capital
on
which
she
had
to
found
it
she
had
not
lived
so
far
from
all
taint
of
corruption
as
to
feel
any
actual
horror
at
the
idea
of
a
girl
giving
herself
to
a
man
not
because
the
man
had
already
by
his
own
capacities
in
that
direction
forced
her
heart
from
her
but
because
he
was
one
likely
to
be
at
all
points
a
good
husband
had
all
this
affair
concerned
any
other
girl
any
friend
of
her
own
and
had
she
known
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
she
would
have
had
no
hesitation
in
recommending
that
other
girl
to
marry
glascock
a
girl
thrown
out
upon
the
world
without
a
shilling
must
make
her
hay
while
the
sun
shines
but
nevertheless
there
was
something
within
her
bosom
which
made
her
long
for
a
better
thing
than
this
she
had
dreamed
if
she
had
not
thought
of
being
able
to
worship
a
man
but
she
could
hardly
worship
glascock
she
had
dreamed
if
she
had
not
thought
of
leaning
upon
a
man
all
through
life
with
her
whole
weight
as
though
that
man
had
been
specially
made
to
be
her
staff
her
prop
her
support
her
wall
of
comfort
and
protection
she
knew
that
if
she
were
to
marry
glascock
and
become
lady
peterborough
in
due
course
she
must
stand
a
good
deal
by
her
own
strength
and
live
without
that
comfortable
leaning
nevertheless
when
she
found
herself
alone
with
the
man
she
by
no
means
knew
whether
she
would
refuse
him
or
not
but
she
knew
that
she
must
pluck
up
courage
for
an
important
moment
and
she
collected
herself
braced
her
muscles
as
it
were
for
a
fight
and
threw
her
mind
into
an
attitude
of
contest
glascock
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
behind
back
took
a
chair
and
placed
it
close
beside
the
head
of
the
sofa
on
which
nora
was
sitting
miss
rowley
he
said
you
and
i
have
known
each
other
now
for
some
months
and
i
hope
you
have
learned
to
regard
me
as
a
friend
oh
yes
indeed
said
nora
with
some
spirit
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
we
have
met
as
friends
and
i
can
most
truly
say
for
myself
that
i
have
taken
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
in
your
acquaintance
it
is
not
only
that
i
admire
you
very
much
he
looked
straight
before
him
as
he
said
this
and
moved
about
the
point
of
the
stick
which
he
was
holding
in
both
his
hands
it
is
not
only
that
perhaps
not
chiefly
that
though
i
do
admire
you
very
much
but
the
truth
is
that
i
like
everything
about
you
nora
smiled
but
she
said
nothing
it
was
better
she
thought
to
let
him
tell
his
story
but
his
mode
of
telling
it
was
not
without
its
efficacy
it
was
not
the
simple
praise
which
made
its
way
with
her
but
a
certain
tone
in
the
words
which
seemed
to
convince
her
that
they
were
true
if
he
had
really
found
her
or
fancied
her
to
be
what
he
said
there
was
a
manliness
in
his
telling
her
so
in
the
plainest
words
that
pleased
her
much
i
know
continued
he
that
this
is
a
very
bald
way
of
telling
of
pleading
my
cause
but
i
do
know
whether
a
bald
way
may
not
be
the
best
if
it
can
only
make
itself
understood
to
be
true
of
course
miss
rowley
you
know
what
i
mean
as
i
said
before
you
have
all
those
things
which
not
only
make
me
love
you
but
which
make
me
like
you
also
if
you
think
that
you
can
love
me
say
so
and
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
you
happy
as
my
wife
there
was
a
clearness
of
expression
in
this
and
a
downright
surrender
of
himself
which
so
flattered
her
and
so
fluttered
her
that
she
was
almost
reduced
to
the
giving
of
herself
up
because
she
could
not
reply
to
such
an
appeal
in
language
less
courteous
than
that
of
agreement
after
a
moment
or
two
she
found
herself
remaining
silent
with
a
growing
feeling
that
silence
would
be
taken
as
conveying
consent
there
floated
quickly
across
her
brain
an
idea
of
the
hardness
of
a
woman
lot
in
that
she
should
be
called
upon
to
decide
her
future
fate
for
life
in
half
a
minute
he
had
had
weeks
to
think
of
this
weeks
in
which
it
would
have
been
almost
unmaidenly
in
her
so
to
think
of
it
as
to
have
made
up
her
mind
to
accept
the
man
had
she
so
made
up
her
mind
and
had
he
not
come
to
her
where
would
she
have
been
then
but
he
had
come
to
her
there
he
was
still
poking
about
with
his
stick
waiting
for
her
and
she
must
answer
him
and
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
peer
an
enormous
match
for
her
very
proper
in
all
respects
such
a
man
that
if
she
should
accept
him
everybody
around
her
would
regard
her
fortune
in
life
as
miraculously
successful
he
was
not
such
a
man
that
any
one
would
point
at
her
and
say
there
see
another
of
them
who
has
sold
herself
for
money
and
a
title
glascock
was
not
an
apollo
not
an
admirable
crichton
but
he
was
a
man
whom
any
girl
might
have
learned
to
love
now
he
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
and
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
answer
him
he
sat
there
waiting
for
her
very
patiently
still
poking
about
the
point
of
his
stick
did
she
really
love
him
though
she
was
so
pressed
by
consideration
of
time
she
did
find
a
moment
in
which
to
ask
herself
the
question
with
a
quick
turn
of
an
eye
she
glanced
at
him
to
see
what
he
was
like
up
to
this
moment
though
she
knew
him
well
she
could
have
given
no
details
of
his
personal
appearance
he
was
a
man
than
hugh
stanbury
so
she
told
herself
with
a
passing
thought
but
he
lacked
he
lacked
what
was
it
that
he
lacked
was
it
youth
or
spirit
or
strength
or
was
it
some
outward
sign
of
an
inward
gift
of
mind
was
it
that
he
was
heavy
while
hugh
was
light
was
it
that
she
could
find
no
fire
in
his
eye
while
hugh
eyes
were
full
of
flashing
or
was
it
that
for
her
especially
for
her
hugh
was
the
appointed
staff
and
appropriate
wall
of
protection
be
all
that
as
it
might
she
knew
at
the
moment
that
she
did
love
not
this
man
but
that
other
who
was
writing
articles
for
the
daily
record
she
must
refuse
the
offer
that
was
so
brilliant
and
give
up
the
idea
of
reigning
as
queen
at
monkhams
oh
glascock
she
said
i
ought
to
answer
you
more
quickly
no
dearest
not
more
quickly
than
suits
you
nothing
ever
in
this
world
can
be
more
important
both
to
you
and
to
me
if
you
want
more
time
to
think
of
it
take
more
time
no
glascock
i
do
not
i
do
know
why
i
should
have
paused
is
not
the
truth
best
yes
certainly
the
truth
is
best
i
do
not
love
you
pray
pray
understand
me
i
understand
it
too
well
miss
rowley
the
stick
was
still
going
and
the
eyes
more
intently
fixed
than
ever
on
something
opposite
i
do
like
you
i
like
you
very
much
and
i
am
so
grateful
i
can
not
understand
why
such
a
man
as
you
should
want
to
make
me
your
wife
because
i
love
you
better
than
all
the
others
simply
that
that
reason
and
that
only
justifies
a
man
in
wanting
to
marry
a
girl
what
a
good
fellow
he
was
and
how
flattering
were
his
words
did
he
not
deserve
what
he
wanted
even
though
it
could
not
be
given
without
a
sacrifice
but
yet
she
did
not
love
him
as
she
looked
at
him
again
she
could
not
there
recognise
her
staff
as
she
looked
at
him
she
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
that
other
staff
ought
to
be
her
staff
may
i
come
again
after
a
month
say
he
asked
when
there
had
been
another
short
period
of
silence
no
no
why
should
you
trouble
yourself
i
am
not
worth
it
it
is
for
me
to
judge
of
that
miss
rowley
all
the
same
i
know
that
i
am
not
worth
it
and
i
could
not
tell
you
to
do
that
then
i
will
wait
and
come
again
without
your
telling
me
oh
glascock
i
did
not
mean
that
indeed
i
did
not
pray
do
not
think
that
take
what
i
say
as
final
i
like
you
more
than
i
can
say
and
i
feel
a
gratitude
to
you
that
i
can
not
express
which
i
shall
never
forget
i
have
never
known
any
one
who
has
seemed
to
be
so
good
as
you
but
it
is
just
what
i
said
before
and
then
she
fairly
burst
into
tears
miss
rowley
he
said
very
slowly
pray
do
not
think
that
i
want
to
ask
any
question
which
it
might
embarrass
you
to
answer
but
my
happiness
is
so
greatly
at
stake
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
your
happiness
too
is
so
greatly
concerned
that
it
is
most
important
that
we
should
not
come
to
a
conclusion
too
quickly
if
i
thought
that
your
heart
were
vacant
i
would
wait
patiently
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
as
my
possible
wife
for
weeks
past
for
months
past
of
course
you
have
not
had
such
thoughts
about
me
as
he
said
this
she
almost
loved
him
for
his
considerate
goodness
it
has
sometimes
seemed
to
me
odd
that
girls
should
love
men
in
such
a
hurry
if
your
heart
be
free
i
will
wait
and
if
you
esteem
me
you
can
see
and
try
whether
you
can
not
learn
to
love
me
i
do
esteem
you
it
depends
on
that
question
then
he
said
slowly
she
sat
silent
for
fully
a
minute
with
her
hands
clasped
and
then
she
answered
him
in
a
whisper
i
do
not
know
she
said
he
also
was
silent
for
a
while
before
he
spoke
again
he
ceased
to
poke
with
his
stick
and
got
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
a
little
apart
from
her
not
looking
at
her
even
yet
i
see
he
said
at
last
i
understand
well
miss
rowley
i
quite
perceive
that
i
can
not
press
my
suit
any
further
now
but
i
shall
not
despair
altogether
i
know
this
that
if
i
might
possibly
succeed
i
should
be
a
very
happy
man
miss
rowley
she
took
his
offered
hand
and
pressed
it
so
warmly
that
had
he
not
been
manly
and
he
would
have
taken
such
pressure
as
a
sign
that
she
wished
him
to
ask
her
again
but
such
was
his
nature
god
bless
you
he
said
and
make
you
happy
whatever
you
may
choose
to
do
then
he
left
her
and
she
heard
him
walk
down
the
stairs
with
heavy
slow
steps
and
she
thought
that
she
could
perceive
from
the
sound
that
he
was
sad
at
heart
but
that
he
was
resolved
not
to
show
his
sadness
outwardly
when
she
was
alone
she
began
to
think
in
earnest
of
what
she
had
done
if
the
reader
were
told
that
she
regretted
the
decision
which
she
had
been
forced
to
make
so
rapidly
a
wrong
impression
would
be
given
of
the
condition
of
her
thoughts
but
there
came
upon
her
suddenly
a
strange
capacity
for
counting
up
and
making
a
mental
inventory
of
all
that
might
have
been
hers
she
knew
and
where
is
the
girl
so
placed
that
does
not
know
that
it
is
a
great
thing
to
be
an
english
peeress
now
as
she
stood
there
thinking
of
it
all
she
was
nora
rowley
without
a
shilling
in
the
world
and
without
a
prospect
of
a
shilling
she
had
often
heard
her
mother
speak
fearful
words
of
future
possible
days
when
colonial
governing
should
no
longer
be
within
the
capacity
of
sir
marmaduke
she
had
been
taught
from
a
very
early
age
that
all
the
material
prosperity
of
her
life
must
depend
on
matrimony
she
could
never
be
comfortably
disposed
of
in
the
world
unless
some
fitting
man
who
possessed
those
things
of
which
she
was
so
bare
should
wish
to
make
her
his
wife
now
there
had
come
a
man
so
thoroughly
fitting
so
marvellously
endowed
that
no
worldly
blessing
would
have
been
wanting
glascock
had
more
than
once
spoken
to
her
of
the
glories
of
monkhams
she
thought
of
monkhams
now
more
than
she
had
ever
thought
of
the
place
before
it
would
have
been
a
great
privilege
to
be
the
mistress
of
an
old
mansion
to
call
oaks
and
elms
her
own
to
know
that
acres
of
gardens
were
submitted
to
her
caprices
to
look
at
herds
of
cows
and
oxen
and
be
aware
that
they
lowed
on
her
own
pastures
and
to
have
been
the
mother
of
a
future
peer
of
england
to
have
the
nursing
and
sweet
custody
and
very
making
of
a
future
senator
would
not
that
have
been
much
and
the
man
himself
who
would
have
been
her
husband
was
such
a
one
that
any
woman
might
have
trusted
herself
to
him
with
perfect
confidence
now
that
he
was
gone
she
almost
fancied
that
she
did
love
him
then
she
thought
of
hugh
stanbury
sitting
as
he
had
described
himself
in
a
little
dark
closet
at
the
office
of
the
in
a
very
old
inky
with
a
tarnished
cloth
cap
upon
his
head
with
a
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
writing
at
midnight
for
the
next
morning
impression
this
or
that
article
according
to
the
order
of
his
master
the
for
the
editor
of
the
daily
record
was
a
gentleman
whose
father
happened
to
be
a
grocer
in
the
city
and
hugh
had
been
accustomed
thus
to
describe
the
family
trade
and
she
might
certainly
have
had
the
peer
and
the
acres
of
garden
and
the
big
house
and
the
senatorial
honours
whereas
the
journeyman
had
never
been
so
she
told
herself
from
moment
to
moment
that
she
had
done
right
that
she
would
do
the
same
a
dozen
times
if
a
dozen
times
the
experiment
could
be
repeated
but
still
still
there
was
the
remembrance
of
all
that
she
had
lost
how
would
her
mother
look
at
her
her
anxious
mother
when
the
story
should
be
told
of
all
that
had
been
offered
to
her
and
all
that
had
been
refused
illustration
to
have
been
the
mother
of
a
future
peer
as
she
was
thinking
of
this
trevelyan
came
into
the
room
nora
felt
that
though
she
might
dread
to
meet
her
mother
she
could
be
bold
enough
on
such
an
occasion
before
her
sister
emily
had
not
done
so
well
with
her
own
affairs
as
to
enable
her
to
preach
with
advantage
about
marriage
he
has
gone
said
trevelyan
as
she
opened
the
door
yes
he
has
gone
well
do
not
pretend
nora
that
you
will
not
tell
me
there
is
nothing
worth
the
telling
emily
what
do
you
mean
i
am
sure
he
has
proposed
he
told
me
in
so
many
words
that
it
was
his
intention
whatever
has
happened
dear
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
i
shall
never
be
mrs
glascock
then
you
have
refused
him
because
of
hugh
stanbury
i
have
refused
him
emily
because
i
did
not
love
him
pray
let
that
be
enough
then
she
walked
out
of
the
room
with
something
of
stateliness
in
her
gait
as
might
become
a
girl
who
had
had
it
in
her
power
to
be
the
future
lady
peterborough
but
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
sacredness
of
her
own
chamber
she
gave
way
to
an
agony
of
tears
it
would
indeed
be
much
to
be
a
lady
peterborough
and
she
had
in
truth
refused
it
all
because
of
hugh
stanbury
was
hugh
stanbury
worth
so
great
a
sacrifice
chapter

the

at
nuncombe
putney
it
was
not
till
a
fortnight
had
passed
after
the
transaction
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
that
trevelyan
and
nora
rowley
first
heard
the
proposition
that
they
should
go
to
live
at

putney
from
bad
to
worse
the
quarrel
between

had
gone
on

trevelyan
had
at
last
told
his
friend

that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
they
must
live
apart
she
is
so
and
perhaps
i
am

had
said
that
it
is
impossible
that
we
should
live
together
lady

had
implored
and
called
to
witness
all
testimonies
profane
and
sacred
against
such
a
step
had
almost
gone
down
on
her
knees
go
to
naples
why
not
naples
or
to
the
quiet
town
in
the
west
of
france
which
was
so
dull
that
a
wicked
roaring
lion
fond
of
cities
and
gambling
and
eating
and
drinking
could
not
live
in
such
a
place
oh
why
not
go
to
the
quiet
town
in
the
west
of
france
was
not
anything
better
than
this
flying
in
the
face
of
god
and
man
perhaps
trevelyan
did
not
himself
like
the
idea
of
the
quiet
dull
french
town
perhaps
he
thought
that
the
flying
in
the
face
of
god
and
man
was
all
done
by
his
wife
not
by
him
and
that
it
was
right
that
his
wife
should
feel
the
consequences
after
many
such
entreaties
many
such
arguments
it
was
at
last
decided
that
the
house
in
curzon
street
should
be
given
up
and
that
he
and
his
wife
live
apart
and
what
about
nora
rowley
asked
lady
milborough
who
had
become
aware
by
this
time
of
nora
insane
folly
in
having
refused
glascock
she
will
go
with
her
sister
i
suppose
and
who
will
maintain
her
dear
dear
dear
it
does
seem
as
though
some
young
people
were
bent
upon
cutting
their
own
throats
and
all
their
family
poor
lady
milborough
just
at
this
time
went
as
near
to
disliking
the
rowleys
as
was
compatible
with
her
nature
it
was
not
possible
to
her
to
hate
anybody
she
thought
that
she
hated
the
colonel
osbornes
but
even
that
was
a
mistake
she
was
very
angry
however
with
both
trevelyan
and
her
sister
and
was
disposed
to
speak
of
them
as
though
they
had
been
born
to
create
trouble
and
vexation
trevelyan
had
not
given
any
direct
answer
to
that
question
about
nora
rowley
maintenance
but
he
was
quite
prepared
to
bear
all
necessary
expense
in
that
direction
at
any
rate
till
sir
marmaduke
should
have
arrived
at
first
there
had
been
an
idea
that
the
two
sisters
should
go
to
the
house
of
their
aunt
outhouse
outhouse
was
the
wife
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
remember
of
a
clergyman
living
in
the
east
of
london
was
very
much
in
the
east
indeed
it
was
a
parish
outside
the
city
lying
near
the
river
very
populous
very
poor
very
low
in
character
and
very
uncomfortable
there
was
a
queerly
situated
at
the
end
of
a
little
blind
lane
with
a
gate
of
its
own
and
a
garden
about
twenty
yards
square
but
the
rectory
of
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
a
comfortable
abode
the
neighbourhood
was
certainly
not
alluring
of
visiting
society
within
a
distance
of
three
or
four
miles
there
was
none
but
what
was
afforded
by
the
families
of
other
clergymen
and
then
outhouse
himself
was
a
somewhat
singular
man
he
was
very
religious
devoted
to
his
work
most
kind
to
the
poor
but
he
was
unfortunately
a
man
and
at
the
same
time
very
obstinate
withal
he
had
never
allied
himself
very
cordially
with
his
wife
brother
sir
marmaduke
allowing
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
a
prejudice
that
people
living
at
the
who
frequented
clubs
and
were
connected
in
any
way
with
fashion
could
not
be
appropriate
companions
for
himself
the
very
title
which
sir
marmaduke
had
acquired
was
repulsive
to
him
and
had
induced
him
to
tell
his
wife
more
than
once
that
sir
this
or
sir
that
could
not
be
fitting
associates
for
a
poor
clergyman
then
his
wife
niece
had
married
a
man
of
fashion
a
man
supposed
at
diddulph
to
be
very
closely
allied
to
fashion
and
outhouse
had
never
been
induced
even
to
dine
in
the
house
in
curzon
street
when
therefore
he
heard
that
and
trevelyan
were
to
be
separated
within
two
years
of
their
marriage
it
could
not
be
expected
that
he
should
be
very
eager
to
lend
to
the
two
sisters
the
use
of
his
rectory
there
had
been
interviews
between
outhouse
and
trevelyan
and
between
outhouse
and
her
niece
and
then
there
was
an
interview
between
outhouse
and
emily
in
which
it
was
decided
that
trevelyan
would
not
go
to
the
parsonage
of
diddulph
she
had
been
very
outspoken
to
her
uncle
declaring
that
she
by
no
means
intended
to
carry
herself
as
a
disgraced
woman
outhouse
had
quoted
paul
to
her
wives
obey
your
husbands
then
she
had
got
up
and
had
spoken
very
angrily
i
look
for
support
from
you
she
said
as
the
man
who
is
the
nearest
to
me
till
my
father
shall
come
but
i
can
not
support
you
in
what
is
wrong
said
the
clergyman
then
trevelyan
had
left
the
room
and
would
not
see
her
uncle
again
she
carried
things
altogether
with
a
high
hand
at
this
time
when
old
bideawhile
called
upon
her
her
husband
ancient
family
lawyer
she
told
that
gentleman
that
if
it
was
her
husband
will
that
they
should
live
apart
it
must
be
so
she
could
not
force
him
to
remain
with
her
she
could
not
compel
him
to
keep
up
the
house
in
curzon
street
she
had
certain
rights
she
believed
she
spoke
then
she
said
of
pecuniary
rights
not
of
those
other
rights
which
her
husband
was
determined
and
was
no
doubt
able
to
ignore
she
did
not
really
know
what
those
pecuniary
rights
might
be
nor
was
she
careful
to
learn
their
exact
extent
she
would
thank
bideawhile
to
see
that
things
were
properly
arranged
but
of
this
her
husband
and
bideawhile
might
be
quite
sure
she
would
take
nothing
as
a
favour
she
would
not
go
to
her
uncle
house
she
declined
to
tell
bideawhile
why
she
had
so
decided
but
she
had
decided
she
was
ready
to
listen
to
any
suggestion
that
her
husband
might
make
as
to
her
residence
but
she
must
claim
to
have
some
choice
in
the
matter
as
to
her
sister
of
course
she
intended
to
give
nora
a
home
as
long
as
such
a
home
might
be
wanted
it
would
be
very
sad
for
nora
but
in
existing
circumstances
such
an
arrangement
would
be
expedient
she
would
not
go
into
details
as
to
expense
her
husband
was
driving
her
away
from
him
and
it
was
for
him
to
say
what
proportion
of
his
income
he
would
choose
to
give
for
her
maintenance
for
hers
and
for
that
of
their
child
she
was
not
desirous
of
anything
beyond
the
means
of
decent
living
but
of
course
she
must
for
the
present
find
a
home
for
her
sister
as
well
as
for
herself
when
speaking
of
her
baby
she
had
striven
hard
so
to
speak
that
bideawhile
should
find
no
trace
of
doubt
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
and
yet
she
had
been
full
of
doubt
full
of
fear
as
bideawhile
had
uttered
nothing
antagonistic
to
her
wishes
in
this
matter
had
seemed
to
agree
that
wherever
the
mother
went
thither
the
child
would
go
also
trevelyan
had
considered
herself
to
be
successful
in
this
interview
the
idea
of
a
residence
at
nuncombe
putney
had
occurred
first
to
trevelyan
himself
and
he
had
spoken
of
it
to
hugh
stanbury
there
had
been
some
difficulty
in
this
because
he
had
snubbed
stanbury
grievously
when
his
friend
had
attempted
to
do
some
work
of
gentle
interference
between
him
and
his
wife
and
when
he
began
the
conversation
he
took
the
trouble
of
stating
in
the
first
instance
that
the
separation
was
a
thing
fixed
so
that
nothing
might
be
urged
on
that
subject
it
is
to
be
you
will
understand
that
he
said
and
if
you
think
that
your
mother
would
agree
to
the
arrangement
it
would
be
satisfactory
to
me
and
might
i
think
be
made
pleasant
to
her
of
course
your
mother
would
be
made
to
understand
that
the
only
fault
with
which
my
wife
is
charged
is
that
of
indomitable
disobedience
to
my
wishes
incompatibility
of
temper
suggested
stanbury
you
may
call
it
that
if
you
please
though
i
must
say
for
myself
that
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
displayed
any
temper
to
which
a
woman
has
a
right
to
object
then
he
had
gone
on
to
explain
what
he
was
prepared
to
do
about
money
he
would
pay
through
hands
so
much
for
maintenance
and
so
much
for
house
rent
on
the
understanding
that
the
money
was
not
to
go
into
his
wife
hands
i
shall
prefer
he
said
to
make
myself
on
her
behalf
what
disbursements
may
be
necessary
i
will
take
care
that
she
receives
a
proper
sum
quarterly
through
bideawhile
for
her
own
clothes
and
for
those
of
our
poor
boy
then
stanbury
had
told
him
of
the
clock
house
and
there
had
been
an
agreement
made
between
them
an
agreement
which
was
then
of
course
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
ladies
at
nuncombe
putney
when
the
suggestion
was
made
to
trevelyan
with
a
proposition
that
the
clock
house
should
be
taken
for
one
year
and
that
for
that
year
at
least
her
boy
should
remain
with
her
she
assented
to
it
she
did
so
with
all
the
calmness
that
she
was
able
to
assume
but
in
truth
almost
everything
seemed
to
have
been
gained
when
she
found
that
she
was
not
to
be
separated
from
her
baby
i
have
no
objection
to
living
in
devonshire
if
trevelyan
wishes
it
she
said
in
her
most
stately
manner
and
certainly
no
objection
to
living
with
stanbury
mother
then
bideawhile
explained
to
her
that
nuncombe
putney
was
not
a
large
town
was
in
fact
a
very
small
and
a
very
remote
village
that
will
make
no
difference
whatsoever
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
she
answered
and
as
for
my
sister
she
must
put
up
with
it
till
my
father
and
my
mother
are
here
i
believe
the
scenery
at
nuncombe
putney
is
very
pretty
lovely
said
bideawhile
who
had
a
general
idea
that
devonshire
is
supposed
to
be
a
picturesque
county
with
such
a
life
before
me
as
i
must
lead
continued
trevelyan
an
ugly
neighbourhood
one
that
would
itself
have
had
no
interest
for
a
stranger
would
certainly
have
been
an
additional
sorrow
so
it
had
been
settled
and
by
the
end
of
july
trevelyan
with
her
sister
and
baby
was
established
at
the
clock
house
under
the
protection
of
stanbury
trevelyan
had
brought
down
her
own
maid
and
her
own
nurse
and
had
found
that
the
arrangements
made
by
her
husband
had
in
truth
been
liberal
the
house
in
curzon
street
had
been
given
up
the
furniture
had
been
sent
to
a
warehouse
and
trevelyan
had
gone
into
lodgings
there
never
were
two
young
people
so
insane
since
the
world
began
said
lady
milborough
to
her
old
friend
fairfax
when
the
thing
was
done
they
will
be
together
again
before
next
april
fairfax
had
replied
but
fairfax
was
a
jolly
dame
who
made
the
best
of
everything
lady
milborough
raised
her
hands
in
despair
and
shook
her
head
i
do
suppose
though
that
glascock
will
go
to
devonshire
after
his
lady
love
said
fairfax
lady
milborough
again
raised
her
hands
and
again
shook
her
head
stanbury
had
given
an
easy
assent
when
her
son
proposed
to
her
this
new
mode
of
life
but
priscilla
had
had
her
doubts
like
all
women
she
thought
that
when
a
man
was
to
be
separated
from
his
wife
the
woman
must
be
in
the
wrong
and
though
it
must
be
doubtless
comfortable
to
go
from
the
cottage
to
the
clock
house
it
would
she
said
with
much
prudence
be
very
uncomfortable
to
go
back
from
the
clock
house
to
the
cottage
hugh
replied
very
cavalierly
generously
that
is
rashly
and
somewhat
impetuously
that
he
would
guarantee
them
against
any
such
degradation
we
do
want
to
be
a
burden
upon
you
my
dear
said
the
mother
you
would
be
a
great
burden
on
me
he
replied
if
you
were
living
uncomfortably
while
i
am
able
to
make
you
comfortable
stanbury
was
soon
won
over
by
trevelyan
by
nora
and
especially
by
the
baby
and
even
priscilla
after
a
week
or
two
began
to
feel
that
she
liked
their
company
priscilla
was
a
young
woman
who
read
a
great
deal
and
even
had
some
gifts
of
understanding
what
she
read
she
borrowed
books
from
the
clergyman
and
paid
a
penny
a
week
to
the
landlady
of
the
stag
and
antlers
for
the
hire
during
half
a
day
of
the
weekly
newspaper
but
now
there
came
a
box
of
books
from
exeter
and
a
daily
paper
from
london
and
to
improve
all
this
both
the
new
comers
were
able
to
talk
with
her
about
the
things
she
read
she
soon
declared
to
her
mother
that
she
liked
miss
rowley
much
the
best
of
the
two
trevelyan
was
too
fond
of
having
her
own
way
she
began
to
understand
she
would
say
to
her
mother
that
a
man
might
find
it
difficult
to
live
with
trevelyan
she
hardly
ever
yields
about
anything
said
priscilla
as
miss
priscilla
stanbury
was
also
very
fond
of
having
her
own
way
it
was
not
surprising
that
she
should
object
to
that
quality
in
this
lady
who
had
come
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
her
the
country
about
nuncombe
putney
is
perhaps
as
pretty
as
any
in
england
it
is
beyond
the
river
teign
between
that
and
dartmoor
and
is
so
lovely
in
all
its
variations
of
rivers
rivulets
broken
ground
hills
and
dales
old
broken
battered
timber
green
knolls
rich
pastures
and
heathy
common
that
the
wonder
is
that
english
lovers
of
scenery
know
so
little
of
it
at
the
stag
and
antlers
old
crocket
than
whom
no
old
woman
in
the
public
line
was
ever
more
generous
more
peppery
or
more
kind
kept
two
clean
and
could
cook
a
leg
of
dartmoor
mutton
and
make
an
apple
pie
against
any
woman
in
devonshire
drat
your
fish
she
would
say
when
some
and
exacting
traveller
would
wish
for
more
than
these
accustomed
viands
cock
you
up
with
dainties
if
you
ca
eat
your
victuals
without
fish
you
must
go
to
exeter
and
then
you
get
it
stinking
mayhap
now
priscilla
stanbury
and
crocket
were
great
friends
and
there
had
been
times
of
deep
want
in
which
crocket
friendship
had
been
very
serviceable
to
the
ladies
at
the
cottage
the
three
young
women
had
been
to
the
inn
one
morning
to
ask
after
a
conveyance
from
nuncombe
putney
to
princetown
and
had
found
that
a
open
carriage
with
an
old
horse
and
a
very
young
driver
could
be
hired
there
we
have
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
priscilla
stanbury
had
said
and
the
only
time
i
was
at
princetown
i
walked
there
and
back
so
they
had
called
at
the
stag
and
antlers
and
crocket
had
told
them
her
mind
upon
several
matters
what
a
dear
old
woman
said
nora
as
they
came
away
having
made
their
bargain
for
the
open
carriage
i
think
she
takes
quite
enough
upon
herself
you
know
said
trevelyan
she
is
a
dear
old
woman
said
priscilla
not
attending
at
all
to
the
last
words
that
had
been
spoken
she
is
one
of
the
best
friends
i
have
in
the
world
if
i
were
to
say
the
best
out
of
my
own
family
perhaps
i
should
not
be
wrong
but
she
uses
such
very
odd
language
for
a
woman
said
trevelyan
now
crocket
had
certainly
dratted
and
darned
the
boy
who
would
come
as
fast
as
she
had
wished
and
had
laughed
at
trevelyan
very
contemptuously
when
that
lady
had
suggested
that
the
urchin
who
was
at
last
brought
forth
might
not
be
a
safe
charioteer
down
some
of
the
hills
i
suppose
i
used
to
it
said
priscilla
at
any
rate
i
know
i
like
it
and
i
like
her
i
dare
say
she
a
good
sort
of
woman
said
trevelyan
only
i
am
not
saying
anything
about
her
being
a
good
woman
now
said
priscilla
interrupting
the
other
with
some
vehemence
but
only
that
she
is
my
friend
i
liked
her
of
all
things
said
nora
has
she
lived
here
always
yes
all
her
life
the
house
belonged
to
her
father
and
to
her
grandfather
before
her
and
i
think
she
says
she
has
never
slept
out
of
it
a
dozen
times
in
her
life
her
husband
is
dead
and
her
daughters
are
married
away
and
she
has
the
great
grief
and
trouble
of
a
son
he
away
now
and
she
all
alone
then
after
a
pause
she
continued
i
dare
say
it
seems
odd
to
you
trevelyan
that
we
should
speak
of
the
innkeeper
as
a
dear
friend
but
you
must
remember
that
we
have
been
poor
among
the
poorest
and
are
so
indeed
now
we
only
came
into
our
present
house
to
receive
you
that
is
where
we
used
to
live
and
she
pointed
to
the
tiny
cottage
which
now
that
it
was
dismantled
and
desolate
looked
to
be
doubly
poor
there
have
been
times
when
we
should
have
gone
to
bed
very
hungry
if
it
had
not
been
for
mrs
crocket
later
in
the
day
trevelyan
finding
priscilla
alone
had
apologized
for
what
she
had
said
about
the
old
woman
i
was
very
thoughtless
and
forgetful
but
i
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
i
will
be
ever
so
fond
of
her
if
you
will
forgive
me
very
well
said
priscilla
smiling
on
those
conditions
i
will
forgive
you
and
from
that
time
there
sprang
up
something
like
a
feeling
of
friendship
between
priscilla
and
trevelyan
nevertheless
priscilla
was
still
of
opinion
that
the
clock
house
arrangement
was
dangerous
and
should
never
have
been
made
and
stanbury
always
timid
of
her
own
nature
began
to
fear
that
it
must
be
so
as
soon
as
she
was
removed
from
the
influence
of
her
son
she
did
not
see
much
even
of
the
few
neighbours
who
lived
around
her
but
she
fancied
that
people
looked
at
her
in
church
as
though
she
had
done
that
which
she
ought
not
to
have
done
in
taking
herself
to
a
big
and
comfortable
house
for
the
sake
of
lending
her
protection
to
a
lady
who
was
separated
from
her
husband
it
was
not
that
she
believed
that
trevelyan
had
been
wrong
but
that
knowing
herself
to
be
weak
she
fancied
that
she
and
her
daughter
would
be
enveloped
in
the
danger
and
suspicion
which
could
not
but
attach
themselves
to
the
lady
condition
instead
of
raising
the
lady
out
of
the
cloud
as
would
have
been
the
case
had
she
herself
been
strong
trevelyan
who
was
sharpsighted
and
soon
saw
that
it
was
so
and
spoke
to
priscilla
on
the
subject
before
she
had
been
a
fortnight
in
the
house
i
am
afraid
your
mother
does
not
like
our
being
here
she
said
how
am
i
to
answer
that
priscilla
replied
just
tell
the
truth
the
truth
is
so
uncivil
at
first
i
did
not
like
it
i
disliked
it
very
much
why
did
you
give
way
i
did
give
way
hugh
talked
my
mother
over
mamma
does
what
i
tell
her
except
when
hugh
tells
her
something
else
i
was
afraid
because
down
here
knowing
nothing
of
the
world
i
did
wish
that
we
little
people
should
be
mixed
up
in
the
quarrels
and
disagreements
of
those
who
are
so
much
bigger
i
do
know
who
it
is
that
is
big
in
this
matter
you
are
big
at
any
rate
by
comparison
but
now
it
must
go
on
the
house
has
been
taken
and
my
fears
are
over
as
regards
you
what
you
observe
in
mamma
is
only
the
effect
not
yet
quite
worn
out
of
what
i
said
before
you
came
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
this
that
we
neither
of
us
believe
a
word
against
you
your
position
is
a
very
unfortunate
one
but
if
it
can
be
remedied
by
your
staying
here
with
us
pray
stay
with
us
it
can
not
be
remedied
said
emily
but
we
could
not
be
anywhere
more
comfortable
than
we
are
here
chapter
xv
what
they
said
about
it
in
the
close
when
miss
stanbury
in
the
close
at
exeter
was
first
told
of
the
arrangement
that
had
been
made
at
nuncombe
putney
she
said
some
very
hard
words
as
to
the
thing
that
had
been
done
she
was
quite
sure
that
trevelyan
was
no
better
than
she
should
be
ladies
who
were
separated
from
their
husbands
never
were
any
better
than
they
should
be
and
what
was
to
be
thought
of
any
woman
who
when
separated
from
her
husband
would
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
such
a
paladin
as
hugh
stanbury
she
heard
the
tidings
of
course
from
dorothy
and
spoke
her
mind
even
to
dorothy
plainly
enough
but
it
was
to
martha
that
she
expressed
herself
with
her
fullest
vehemence
we
always
knew
she
said
that
my
brother
had
married
an
silly
woman
one
of
the
most
unsuited
to
be
the
mistress
of
a
clergyman
house
that
ever
a
man
set
eyes
on
but
i
think
she
allow
herself
to
be
led
into
such
a
stupid
thing
as
this
i
do
suppose
the
lady
has
done
anything
amiss
any
more
than
combing
her
husband
hair
and
the
like
of
that
said
martha
do
tell
me
why
by
their
own
story
she
has
got
a
lover
but
he
ai
to
come
after
her
down
here
i
suppose
and
as
for
lovers
i
told
that
the
most
of
have
up
in
london
but
it
do
mean
much
only
just
idle
talking
and
gallivanting
when
women
ca
keep
themselves
from
idle
talking
with
strange
gentlemen
they
are
very
far
gone
on
the
road
to
the
devil
my
notion
and
that
was
everybody
notion
a
few
years
ago
but
now
what
with
divorce
bills
and
women
rights
and
penny
papers
and
false
hair
and
married
women
being
just
like
giggling
girls
and
giggling
girls
knowing
just
as
much
as
married
women
when
a
woman
has
been
married
a
year
or
two
she
begins
to
think
whether
she
have
more
fun
for
her
money
by
living
apart
from
her
husband
miss
dorothy
says
oh
bother
what
miss
dorothy
says
miss
dorothy
only
knows
what
it
has
suited
that
scamp
her
brother
to
tell
her
i
understand
this
woman
has
come
away
because
of
a
lover
and
if
that
so
my
is
very
wrong
to
receive
her
the
temptation
of
the
clock
house
has
been
too
much
for
her
it
not
my
doing
all
that
evening
miss
stanbury
and
dorothy
went
out
to
tea
at
the
house
of
machugh
and
there
the
matter
was
very
much
discussed
the
family
of
the
trevelyans
was
known
by
name
in
these
parts
and
the
fact
of
trevelyan
having
been
sent
to
live
in
a
devonshire
village
with
devonshire
ladies
who
had
a
relation
in
exeter
so
well
esteemed
as
miss
stanbury
of
the
close
were
circumstances
of
themselves
sufficient
to
ensure
a
considerable
amount
of
prestige
at
the
city
for
the
tidings
of
this
unfortunate
family
quarrel
some
reticence
was
of
course
necessary
because
of
the
presence
of
miss
stanbury
and
of
dorothy
to
miss
stanbury
herself
machugh
and
crumbie
of
cronstadt
house
did
not
scruple
to
express
themselves
very
plainly
and
to
whisper
a
question
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
should
the
lover
make
his
appearance
at
nuncombe
putney
but
they
who
spoke
of
the
matter
before
dorothy
were
at
first
more
charitable
or
at
least
more
forbearing
gibson
who
was
one
of
the
minor
canons
and
the
two
miss
frenches
from
heavitree
who
had
the
reputation
of
hunting
unmarried
clergymen
in
couples
seemed
to
have
heard
all
about
it
when
machugh
and
miss
stanbury
with
and
crumbie
had
seated
themselves
at
their
the
younger
people
were
able
to
express
their
opinions
without
danger
of
interruption
or
of
rebuke
it
was
known
to
all
exeter
by
this
time
that
dorothy
stanbury
mother
had
gone
to
the
clock
house
and
that
she
had
done
so
in
order
that
trevelyan
might
have
a
home
but
it
was
not
yet
known
whether
anybody
had
called
upon
them
there
was
merton
the
wife
of
the
present
parson
of
nuncombe
who
had
known
the
stanburys
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
there
was
ellison
of
lessboro
who
lived
only
four
miles
from
nuncombe
and
who
kept
a
it
would
be
a
great
thing
to
know
how
these
ladies
had
behaved
in
so
difficult
and
embarrassing
a
position
trevelyan
and
her
sister
had
now
been
at
nuncombe
putney
for
more
than
a
fortnight
and
something
in
that
matter
of
calling
must
have
been
done
or
have
been
left
undone
in
answer
to
an
question
asked
by
camilla
french
dorothy
at
once
set
the
matter
at
rest
merton
said
camilla
french
must
find
it
a
great
thing
to
have
two
new
ladies
come
to
the
village
especially
now
that
she
has
lost
you
miss
stanbury
mamma
tells
me
said
dorothy
that
trevelyan
and
miss
rowley
do
not
mean
to
know
anybody
they
have
given
it
out
quite
plainly
so
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
dear
dear
said
camilla
french
i
dare
say
it
for
the
best
said
arabella
french
who
was
the
elder
and
who
looked
very
meek
and
soft
miss
french
almost
always
looked
meek
and
soft
i
afraid
it
will
make
it
very
dull
for
your
mother
not
seeing
her
old
friends
said
gibson
mamma
wo
feel
that
at
all
said
dorothy
stanbury
i
suppose
will
see
her
own
friends
at
her
own
house
just
the
same
said
camilla
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
that
when
there
is
a
lady
who
is
to
remain
unknown
said
arabella
do
you
think
so
mr
gibson
gibson
replied
that
perhaps
there
might
be
a
difficulty
but
he
was
sure
the
difficulty
he
thought
might
be
got
over
if
the
ladies
did
not
always
occupy
the
same
room
you
have
never
seen
trevelyan
have
you
miss
stanbury
asked
camilla
never
she
is
not
an
old
family
friend
then
or
anything
of
that
sort
oh
dear
no
because
said
arabella
it
is
so
odd
how
different
people
get
together
sometimes
then
dorothy
explained
that
trevelyan
and
her
brother
hugh
had
long
been
friends
oh
of
trevelyan
said
camilla
then
it
is
he
that
has
sent
his
wife
to
nuncombe
not
she
that
has
come
there
i
suppose
there
has
been
some
agreement
said
dorothy
just
so
just
so
said
arabella
the
meek
i
should
like
to
see
her
they
say
that
she
is
very
beautiful
do
they
my
brother
says
that
she
is
handsome
exceedingly
lovely
i
told
said
camilla
i
should
like
to
see
her
should
you
mr
gibson
i
always
like
to
see
a
pretty
woman
said
gibson
with
a
polite
bow
which
the
sisters
shared
between
them
i
suppose
she
go
to
church
said
camilla
very
likely
not
said
arabella
ladies
of
that
sort
very
often
do
go
to
church
i
dare
say
you
find
that
she
never
stir
out
of
the
place
at
all
and
that
not
a
soul
in
nuncombe
will
ever
see
her
except
the
gardener
it
is
such
a
thing
for
a
woman
to
be
separated
from
her
husband
do
you
think
so
mr
gibson
of
course
it
is
said
he
with
a
shake
of
his
head
which
was
intended
to
imply
that
the
censure
of
the
church
must
of
course
attend
any
sundering
of
those
whom
the
church
had
bound
together
but
which
implied
also
by
the
absence
from
it
of
any
intense
clerical
severity
that
as
the
separated
wife
was
allowed
to
live
with
so
very
respectable
a
lady
as
stanbury
there
must
probably
be
some
mitigating
circumstances
attending
this
special
separation
i
wonder
what
he
is
like
said
camilla
after
a
pause
who
asked
arabella
the
gentleman
said
camilla
what
gentleman
demanded
arabella
i
do
mean
trevelyan
said
camilla
i
do
believe
there
really
is
eh
is
there
said
gibson
very
timidly
oh
dear
yes
said
arabella
i
afraid
there
something
of
the
kind
said
camilla
i
heard
that
there
is
and
i
heard
his
name
then
she
whispered
very
closely
into
the
ear
of
gibson
the
words
colonel
osborne
as
though
her
lips
were
by
far
too
pure
to
mention
aloud
any
sound
so
full
of
iniquity
indeed
said
gibson
but
he
quite
an
old
man
said
dorothy
and
knew
her
father
intimately
before
she
was
born
and
as
far
as
i
can
understand
her
husband
does
not
suspect
her
in
the
least
and
it
only
because
there
a
misunderstanding
between
them
and
not
at
all
because
of
the
gentleman
oh
exclaimed
camilla
ah
exclaimed
arabella
that
would
make
a
difference
said
gibson
but
for
a
married
woman
to
have
her
name
mentioned
at
all
with
a
gentleman
it
is
so
bad
is
it
not
mr
gibson
and
then
arabella
also
had
her
whisper
into
the
clergyman
ear
very
closely
afraid
there
not
a
doubt
about
the
colonel
i
afraid
not
i
am
indeed
two
by
honours
and
the
odd
and
it
my
deal
said
miss
stanbury
briskly
and
the
sharp
click
with
which
she
put
the
markers
down
upon
the
table
was
heard
all
through
the
room
i
do
want
anybody
to
tell
me
she
said
that
when
a
young
woman
is
parted
from
her
husband
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
that
she
has
been
very
foolish
but
what
a
woman
to
do
if
her
husband
beats
her
said
crumbie
beat
him
again
said
machugh
and
the
husband
will
be
sure
to
have
the
worst
of
it
said
crumbie
well
i
declare
if
you
have
turned
up
an
honour
again
miss
stanbury
it
was
your
wife
that
cut
it
to
me
mr
crumbie
then
they
were
again
at
once
immersed
in
the
play
and
the
name
neither
of
trevelyan
nor
osborne
was
heard
till
miss
stanbury
was
marking
her
double
under
the
candlestick
but
during
all
pauses
in
the
game
the
conversation
went
back
to
the
same
topic
and
when
the
rubber
was
over
they
who
had
been
playing
it
lost
themselves
for
ten
minutes
in
the
allurements
of
the
interesting
subject
it
was
so
singular
a
coincidence
that
the
lady
should
have
gone
to
nuncombe
putney
of
all
villages
in
england
and
to
the
house
of
stanbury
of
all
ladies
in
england
and
then
was
she
innocent
or
was
she
guilty
and
if
guilty
in
what
degree
that
she
had
been
allowed
to
bring
her
baby
with
her
was
considered
to
be
a
great
point
in
her
favour
crumbie
opinion
was
that
it
was
only
a
few
words
crumbie
was
afraid
that
she
had
been
a
little
light
machugh
said
that
there
was
never
fire
without
smoke
and
miss
stanbury
as
she
took
her
departure
declared
that
the
young
women
of
the
present
day
did
know
what
they
were
after
they
think
that
the
world
should
be
all
frolic
and
dancing
and
they
have
no
more
idea
of
doing
their
duty
and
earning
their
bread
than
a
boy
home
for
the
holidays
has
of
doing
lessons
then
as
she
went
home
with
dorothy
across
the
close
she
spoke
a
word
which
she
intended
to
be
very
serious
i
do
mean
to
say
anything
against
your
mother
for
what
she
has
done
as
yet
somebody
must
take
the
woman
in
and
perhaps
it
was
natural
but
if
that
colonel
makes
his
way
down
to
nuncombe
putney
your
mother
must
send
her
packing
if
she
has
any
respect
either
for
herself
or
for
priscilla
chapter
xvi
dartmoor
illustration
the
decision
of
miss
stanbury
respecting
the
arrangement
at
nuncombe
putney
had
been
communicated
to
dorothy
as
the
two
walked
home
at
night
across
the
close
from
machugh
house
and
it
was
accepted
by
dorothy
as
being
wise
and
proper
it
amounted
to
this
if
trevelyan
should
behave
herself
with
propriety
in
her
retirement
at
the
clock
house
no
further
blame
in
the
matter
should
be
attributed
to
stanbury
for
receiving
her
at
any
rate
in
dorothy
hearing
the
existing
scheme
whether
wise
or
foolish
should
be
regarded
as
an
accepted
scheme
but
if
trevelyan
should
be
indiscreet
if
for
instance
colonel
osborne
should
show
himself
at
nuncombe
putney
then
for
the
sake
of
the
family
miss
stanbury
would
speak
out
and
would
speak
out
very
loudly
all
this
dorothy
understood
and
she
could
perceive
that
her
aunt
had
strong
suspicion
that
there
would
be
indiscretion
i
never
knew
one
like
her
said
miss
stanbury
who
when
she
got
away
from
one
man
did
want
to
have
another
dangling
after
her
a
week
had
hardly
passed
after
the
party
at
machugh
and
trevelyan
had
hardly
been
three
weeks
at
nuncombe
putney
before
the
tidings
which
miss
stanbury
almost
expected
reached
her
ears
the
colonel
been
at
the
clock
house
said
martha
now
it
was
quite
understood
in
the
close
by
this
time
that
the
colonel
meant
colonel
osborne
no
i
told
he
has
though
for
sure
and
certain
who
says
so
giles
hickbody
was
down
at
lessboro
and
see
him
hisself
a
portly
man
not
one
of
your
young
lovers
that
the
man
oh
yes
he
went
over
to
nuncombe
putney
as
sure
as
anything
hired
clegg
chaise
and
pair
and
asked
for
trevelyan
house
as
open
as
anything
when
giles
asked
in
the
yard
they
told
him
as
how
that
was
the
married
lady
young
man
i
like
to
be
at
his
tail
so
i
would
with
a
said
miss
stanbury
whose
hatred
for
those
sins
by
which
the
comfort
and
respectability
of
the
world
are
destroyed
was
not
only
sincere
but
intense
well
and
what
then
he
came
back
and
slept
at
clegg
that
night
at
least
that
was
what
he
said
he
should
do
miss
stanbury
however
was
not
so
precipitate
or
uncharitable
as
to
act
strongly
upon
information
such
as
this
before
she
even
said
a
word
to
dorothy
she
made
further
inquiry
she
made
very
minute
inquiry
writing
even
to
her
very
old
and
intimate
friend
ellison
of
lessboro
writing
to
that
lady
a
most
cautious
and
guarded
letter
at
last
it
became
a
fact
proved
to
her
mind
that
colonel
osborne
had
been
at
the
clock
house
had
been
received
there
and
had
remained
there
for
hours
had
been
allowed
access
to
trevelyan
and
had
slept
the
night
at
the
inn
at
lessboro
the
thing
was
so
terrible
to
miss
stanbury
mind
that
even
false
hair
colenso
and
penny
newspapers
did
not
account
for
it
i
shall
begin
to
believe
that
the
evil
one
has
been
allowed
to
come
among
us
in
person
because
of
our
sins
she
said
to
martha
and
she
meant
it
in
the
meantime
trevelyan
as
may
be
remembered
had
hired
crocket
open
carriage
and
the
three
young
women
trevelyan
nora
and
priscilla
made
a
little
excursion
to
princetown
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
picnic
at
princetown
in
the
middle
of
dartmoor
about
nine
miles
from
nuncombe
putney
is
the
prison
establishment
at
which
are
kept
convicts
undergoing
penal
servitude
it
is
regarded
by
all
the
country
round
with
great
interest
chiefly
because
the
prisoners
now
and
again
escape
and
then
there
comes
a
period
of
interesting
excitement
until
the
escaped
felon
shall
have
been
again
taken
how
can
you
tell
where
he
may
be
or
whether
it
may
not
suit
him
to
find
his
rest
in
your
own
cupboard
or
under
your
own
bed
and
then
as
escape
without
notice
will
of
course
be
the
object
to
attain
that
he
will
probably
cut
your
throat
and
the
throat
of
everybody
belonging
to
you
all
which
considerations
give
an
interest
to
princetown
and
excite
in
the
hearts
of
the
devonians
of
these
parts
a
strong
affection
for
the
dartmoor
prison
of
those
who
visit
princetown
comparatively
few
effect
an
entrance
within
the
walls
of
the
gaol
they
look
at
the
gloomy
place
with
a
mysterious
interest
feeling
something
akin
to
envy
for
the
prisoners
who
have
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
solving
the
mysteries
of
prison
life
and
who
know
how
men
feel
when
they
have
their
hair
cut
short
and
are
free
from
moral
responsibility
for
their
own
conduct
and
are
moved
about
in
gangs
and
treated
like
wild
beasts
but
the
journey
to
princetown
from
whatever
side
it
is
approached
has
the
charm
of
wild
and
beautiful
scenery
the
spot
itself
is
ugly
enough
but
you
can
go
not
thither
without
breathing
the
sweetest
freshest
air
and
encountering
that
delightful
sense
of
romance
which
moorland
scenery
always
produces
the
idea
of
our
three
friends
was
to
see
the
moor
rather
than
the
prison
to
learn
something
of
the
country
around
and
to
enjoy
the
excitement
of
eating
a
sandwich
sitting
on
a
hillock
in
exchange
for
the
ordinary
comforts
of
a
good
dinner
with
chairs
and
tables
a
bottle
of
sherry
and
water
and
a
paper
of
sandwiches
contained
their
whole
banquet
for
ladies
though
they
like
good
things
at
picnics
and
indeed
at
other
times
almost
as
well
as
men
like
them
very
seldom
prepare
dainties
for
themselves
alone
men
are
wiser
and
more
thoughtful
and
are
careful
to
have
the
good
things
even
if
they
are
to
be
enjoyed
without
companionship
crocket
boy
though
he
was
only
about
three
feet
high
was
a
miracle
of
skill
and
discretion
he
used
the
machine
as
the
patent
drag
is
called
in
going
down
the
hills
with
the
utmost
care
he
never
forced
the
beast
beyond
a
walk
if
there
was
the
slightest
rise
in
the
ground
and
as
there
was
always
a
rise
the
journey
was
slow
but
the
three
ladies
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
and
trevelyan
was
in
better
spirits
than
she
herself
had
thought
to
be
possible
for
her
in
her
present
condition
most
of
us
have
recognised
the
fact
that
a
dram
of
spirits
will
create
that
a
nip
of
brandy
will
create
hilarity
or
at
least
alacrity
and
that
a
glass
of
sherry
will
often
pick
up
and
set
in
order
the
prostrate
animal
and
mental
faculties
of
the
drinker
but
we
are
not
sufficiently
alive
to
the
fact
that
copious
draughts
of
fresh
air
of
air
fresh
and
unaccustomed
will
have
precisely
the
same
effect
we
do
know
that
now
and
again
it
is
very
essential
to
change
the
air
but
we
generally
consider
that
to
do
that
with
any
chance
of
advantage
it
is
necessary
to
go
far
afield
and
we
think
also
that
such
change
of
the
air
is
only
needful
when
sickness
of
the
body
has
come
upon
us
or
when
it
threatens
to
come
we
are
seldom
aware
that
we
may
imbibe
long
potations
of
pleasure
and
healthy
excitement
without
perhaps
going
out
of
our
own
county
that
such
potations
are
within
a
journey
of
most
of
us
and
that
they
are
to
be
had
for
a
head
all
expenses
told
trevelyan
probably
did
not
know
that
the
cloud
was
lifted
off
her
mind
and
the
load
of
her
sorrow
made
light
to
her
by
the
special
vigour
of
the
air
of
the
moor
but
she
did
know
that
she
was
enjoying
herself
and
that
the
world
was
pleasanter
to
her
than
it
had
been
for
months
past
when
they
had
sat
upon
their
hillocks
and
eaten
their
sandwiches
regretting
that
the
basket
of
provisions
had
not
been
bigger
and
had
drunk
their
sherry
and
water
out
of
the
little
horn
mug
which
crocket
had
lent
them
nora
started
off
across
the
moorland
alone
the
horse
had
been
left
to
be
fed
in
princetown
and
they
had
walked
back
to
a
bush
under
which
they
had
rashly
left
their
basket
of
provender
concealed
it
happened
however
that
on
that
day
there
was
no
escaped
felon
about
to
watch
what
they
had
done
and
the
food
and
the
drink
had
been
found
secure
nora
had
gone
off
and
as
her
sister
and
priscilla
sat
leaning
against
their
hillocks
with
their
backs
to
the
road
she
could
be
seen
standing
now
on
one
little
eminence
and
now
on
another
thinking
doubtless
as
she
stood
on
the
one
how
good
it
would
be
to
be
lady
peterborough
and
as
she
stood
on
the
other
how
much
better
to
be
hugh
stanbury
only
before
she
could
be
hugh
stanbury
it
would
be
necessary
that
hugh
stanbury
should
share
her
opinion
and
necessary
also
that
he
should
be
able
to
maintain
a
wife
i
should
never
do
to
be
a
very
poor
man
wife
she
said
to
herself
and
remembered
as
she
said
it
that
in
reference
to
the
prospect
of
her
being
lady
peterborough
the
man
who
was
to
be
lord
peterborough
was
at
any
rate
ready
to
make
her
his
wife
and
on
that
side
there
were
none
of
those
difficulties
about
house
and
money
and
position
which
stood
in
the
way
of
the
hugh
stanbury
side
of
the
question
she
was
not
she
thought
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
a
very
poor
man
but
she
conceived
of
herself
that
she
would
do
very
well
as
a
future
lady
peterborough
in
the
of
monkhams
she
was
so
far
vain
as
to
fancy
that
she
could
look
and
speak
and
move
and
have
her
being
after
the
fashion
which
is
approved
for
the
lady
peterboroughs
of
the
world
it
was
not
clear
to
her
that
nature
had
not
expressly
intended
her
to
be
a
lady
peterborough
whereas
as
far
as
she
could
see
nature
had
not
intended
her
to
be
a
hugh
stanbury
with
a
precarious
income
of
perhaps
ten
guineas
a
week
when
journalism
was
doing
well
so
she
moved
on
to
another
little
eminence
to
think
of
it
there
it
was
clear
to
her
that
if
she
should
accept
glascock
she
would
sell
herself
and
not
give
herself
away
and
she
had
told
herself
scores
of
times
before
this
that
a
young
woman
should
give
herself
away
and
not
sell
herself
should
either
give
herself
away
or
keep
herself
to
herself
as
circumstances
might
go
she
had
been
quite
sure
that
she
would
never
sell
herself
but
this
was
a
lesson
which
she
had
taught
herself
when
she
was
very
young
before
she
had
come
to
understand
the
world
and
its
hard
necessities
nothing
she
now
told
herself
could
be
worse
than
to
hang
like
a
round
the
neck
of
a
poor
man
it
might
be
a
very
good
thing
to
give
herself
away
for
love
but
it
would
not
be
a
good
thing
to
be
the
means
of
ruining
the
man
she
loved
even
if
that
man
were
willing
to
be
so
ruined
and
then
she
thought
that
she
could
also
love
that
other
man
a
little
could
love
him
sufficiently
for
comfortable
domestic
purposes
and
it
would
undoubtedly
be
very
pleasant
to
have
all
the
troubles
of
her
life
settled
for
her
if
she
were
glascock
known
to
the
world
as
the
future
lady
peterborough
would
it
not
be
within
her
power
to
bring
her
sister
and
her
sister
husband
again
together
the
tribute
of
the
monkhams
authority
and
influence
to
her
sister
side
of
the
question
would
be
most
salutary
she
tried
to
make
herself
believe
that
in
this
way
she
would
be
doing
a
good
deed
upon
the
whole
she
thought
that
if
glascock
should
give
her
another
chance
she
would
accept
him
and
he
had
distinctly
promised
that
he
would
give
her
another
chance
it
might
be
that
this
unfortunate
quarrel
in
the
trevelyan
family
would
deter
him
people
do
not
wish
to
ally
themselves
with
family
quarrels
but
if
the
chance
came
in
her
way
she
would
accept
it
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
that
when
she
turned
round
from
off
the
last
knoll
on
which
she
had
stood
to
return
to
her
sister
and
priscilla
stanbury
illustration
nora
tries
to
make
herself
believe
they
two
had
sat
still
under
the
shade
of
a
thorn
bush
looking
at
nora
as
she
was
wandering
about
and
talking
together
more
freely
than
they
had
ever
done
before
on
the
circumstances
that
had
brought
them
together
how
pretty
she
looks
priscilla
had
said
as
nora
was
standing
with
her
figure
clearly
marked
by
the
light
yes
she
is
very
pretty
and
has
been
much
admired
this
terrible
affair
of
mine
is
a
cruel
blow
to
her
you
mean
that
it
is
bad
for
her
to
come
and
live
here
without
society
not
exactly
that
though
of
course
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
go
out
and
i
do
know
how
a
girl
is
ever
to
get
settled
in
the
world
unless
she
goes
out
but
it
is
always
an
injury
to
be
connected
in
any
way
with
a
woman
who
is
separated
from
her
husband
it
must
be
bad
for
you
it
wo
hurt
me
said
priscilla
nothing
of
that
kind
can
hurt
me
i
mean
that
people
say
such
things
i
stand
alone
and
can
take
care
of
myself
said
priscilla
i
defy
the
evil
tongues
of
all
the
world
to
hurt
me
my
personal
cares
are
limited
to
an
old
gown
and
bread
and
cheese
i
like
a
pair
of
gloves
to
go
to
church
with
but
that
is
only
the
remnant
of
a
prejudice
the
world
has
so
very
little
to
give
me
that
i
am
pretty
nearly
sure
that
it
will
take
nothing
away
and
you
are
contented
well
no
i
ca
say
that
i
am
contented
i
hardly
think
that
anybody
ought
to
be
contented
should
my
mother
die
and
dorothy
remain
with
my
aunt
or
get
married
i
should
be
utterly
alone
in
the
world
providence
or
whatever
you
call
it
has
made
me
a
lady
after
a
fashion
so
that
i
ca
live
with
the
ploughmen
wives
and
at
the
same
time
has
so
used
me
in
other
respects
that
i
ca
live
with
anybody
else
why
should
not
you
get
married
as
well
as
dorothy
who
would
have
me
and
if
i
had
a
husband
i
should
want
a
good
one
a
man
with
a
head
on
his
shoulders
and
a
heart
even
if
i
were
young
and
or
rich
i
doubt
whether
i
could
please
myself
as
it
is
i
am
as
likely
to
be
taken
bodily
to
heaven
as
to
become
any
man
wife
i
suppose
most
women
think
so
of
themselves
at
some
time
and
yet
they
are
married
i
am
not
fit
to
marry
i
am
often
cross
and
i
like
my
own
way
and
i
have
a
distaste
for
men
i
never
in
my
life
saw
a
man
whom
i
wished
even
to
make
my
intimate
friend
i
should
think
any
man
an
idiot
who
began
to
make
soft
speeches
to
me
and
i
should
tell
him
so
ah
you
might
find
it
different
when
he
went
on
with
it
but
i
think
said
priscilla
that
when
a
woman
is
married
there
is
nothing
to
which
she
should
not
submit
on
behalf
of
her
husband
you
mean
that
for
me
of
course
i
mean
it
for
you
how
should
i
not
be
thinking
of
you
living
as
you
are
under
the
same
roof
with
us
and
i
am
thinking
of
louey
louey
was
the
baby
what
are
you
to
do
when
after
a
year
or
two
his
father
shall
send
for
him
to
have
him
under
his
own
care
nothing
shall
separate
me
from
my
child
said
trevelyan
eagerly
that
is
easily
said
but
i
suppose
the
power
of
doing
as
he
pleased
would
be
with
him
why
should
it
be
with
him
i
do
not
at
all
know
that
it
would
be
with
him
i
have
not
left
his
house
it
is
he
that
has
turned
me
out
there
can
i
think
be
very
little
doubt
what
you
should
do
said
priscilla
after
a
pause
during
which
she
had
got
up
from
her
seat
under
the
thorn
bush
what
should
i
do
asked
trevelyan
go
back
to
him
i
will
if
he
will
write
and
ask
me
nay
how
could
i
help
myself
i
am
his
creature
and
must
go
or
come
as
he
bids
me
i
am
here
only
because
he
has
sent
me
you
should
write
and
ask
him
to
take
you
ask
him
to
forgive
me
because
he
has
me
never
mind
about
that
said
priscilla
standing
over
her
companion
who
was
still
lying
under
the
bush
all
that
is
pride
which
should
be
thrown
to
the
winds
the
more
right
you
have
been
hitherto
the
better
you
can
afford
to
go
on
being
right
what
is
it
that
we
all
live
upon
but
when
we
want
praise
it
is
only
because
praise
enables
us
to
think
well
of
ourselves
every
one
to
himself
is
the
centre
and
pivot
of
all
the
world
it
a
very
poor
world
that
goes
round
upon
my
pivot
said
trevelyan
i
do
know
how
this
quarrel
came
up
exclaimed
priscilla
and
i
do
care
to
know
but
it
seems
a
trumpery
quarrel
as
to
who
should
beg
each
other
pardon
first
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
sheer
and
simple
nonsense
ask
him
to
let
it
all
be
forgotten
i
suppose
he
loves
you
how
can
i
know
he
did
once
and
you
love
him
yes
i
love
him
certainly
i
do
see
how
you
can
have
a
doubt
here
is
jack
with
the
carriage
and
if
we
do
mind
he
pass
us
by
without
seeing
us
then
trevelyan
got
up
and
when
they
had
succeeded
in
diverting
jack
attention
for
a
moment
from
the
horse
they
called
to
nora
who
was
still
moving
about
from
one
knoll
to
another
and
who
showed
no
desire
to
abandon
the
contemplations
in
which
she
had
been
engaged
it
had
been
before
they
left
home
in
the
morning
and
they
were
due
to
be
at
home
in
time
for
tea
which
is
an
epoch
in
the
day
generally
allowed
to
be
more
elastic
than
some
others
when
stanbury
lived
in
the
cottage
her
hour
for
tea
had
been
six
this
had
been
stretched
to
seven
when
she
received
trevelyan
at
the
clock
house
and
it
was
eight
before
jack
landed
them
at
their
door
it
was
manifest
to
them
all
as
they
entered
the
house
that
there
was
an
air
of
mystery
in
the
face
of
the
girl
who
had
opened
the
door
for
them
she
did
not
speak
however
till
they
were
all
within
the
passage
then
she
uttered
a
few
words
very
solemnly
there
be
a
gentleman
come
she
said
a
gentleman
said
trevelyan
thinking
in
the
first
moment
of
her
husband
and
in
the
second
of
colonel
osborne
he
be
for
you
miss
said
the
girl
bobbing
her
head
at
nora
upon
hearing
this
nora
sank
speechless
into
the
chair
which
stood
in
the
passage
chapter
xvii
a
gentleman
comes
to
nuncombe
putney
it
soon
became
known
to
them
all
as
they
remained
clustered
in
the
hall
that
glascock
was
in
the
house
stanbury
came
out
to
them
and
informed
them
that
he
had
been
at
nuncombe
putney
for
the
last
five
hours
and
that
he
had
asked
for
trevelyan
when
he
called
it
became
evident
as
the
affairs
of
the
evening
went
on
that
stanbury
had
for
a
few
minutes
been
thrown
into
a
terrible
state
of
amazement
thinking
that
the
colonel
had
appeared
the
strange
gentleman
however
having
obtained
admittance
explained
who
he
was
saying
that
he
was
very
desirous
of
seeing
trevelyan
and
miss
rowley
it
may
be
presumed
that
a
glimmer
of
light
did
make
its
way
into
stanbury
mind
on
the
subject
but
up
to
the
moment
at
which
the
three
travellers
arrived
she
had
been
in
doubt
on
the
subject
glascock
had
declared
that
he
would
take
a
walk
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
had
expressed
high
approval
of
crocket
culinary
skill
when
crocket
heard
that
she
had
entertained
the
son
of
a
lord
she
was
very
loud
in
her
praise
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
eaten
two
mutton
chops
and
called
for
a
third
he
had
thought
it
no
disgrace
to
apply
himself
to
the
second
half
of
an
apple
pie
and
had
professed
himself
to
be
an
ardent
admirer
of
devonshire
cream
it
them
as
turns
up
their
little
noses
at
the
victuals
as
is
set
before
them
said
crocket
after
his
dinner
glascock
had
returned
to
the
clock
house
and
had
been
sitting
there
for
an
hour
with
stanbury
not
much
to
her
delight
or
to
his
when
the
carriage
was
driven
up
to
the
door
he
is
to
go
back
to
lessboro
said
stanbury
in
a
whisper
of
course
you
must
see
him
before
he
goes
said
trevelyan
to
her
sister
there
had
as
was
natural
been
very
much
said
between
the
two
sisters
about
glascock
nora
had
abstained
from
asserting
in
any
decided
way
that
she
disliked
the
man
and
had
always
absolutely
refused
to
allow
hugh
stanbury
name
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
question
whatever
might
be
her
own
thoughts
about
hugh
stanbury
she
had
kept
them
even
from
her
sister
when
her
sister
had
told
her
that
she
had
refused
glascock
because
of
hugh
she
had
shown
herself
to
be
indignant
and
had
since
that
said
one
or
two
fine
things
as
to
her
capacity
to
refuse
a
brilliant
offer
simply
because
the
man
who
had
made
it
was
indifferent
to
her
trevelyan
had
learned
from
her
that
her
suitor
had
declared
his
intention
to
persevere
and
here
was
perseverance
with
a
vengeance
of
course
you
must
see
him
at
once
said
trevelyan
nora
for
a
few
seconds
had
remained
silent
and
then
had
run
up
to
her
room
her
sister
followed
her
instantly
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
said
priscilla
to
her
mother
i
suppose
he
is
in
love
with
miss
rowley
said
stanbury
but
who
is
he
then
stanbury
told
all
that
she
knew
she
had
seen
from
his
card
that
he
was
an
honourable
glascock
she
had
collected
from
what
he
had
said
that
he
was
an
old
friend
of
the
two
ladies
her
conviction
was
strong
in
glascock
favour
thinking
as
she
expressed
herself
that
everything
was
right
and
proper
but
she
could
hardly
explain
why
she
thought
so
i
do
wish
that
they
had
never
come
said
priscilla
who
could
not
rid
herself
of
an
idea
that
there
must
be
danger
in
having
to
do
with
women
who
had
men
running
after
them
of
course
i
see
him
said
nora
to
her
sister
i
have
not
refused
to
see
him
why
do
you
scold
me
i
have
not
scolded
you
nora
but
i
do
want
you
to
think
how
immensely
important
this
is
of
course
it
is
important
and
so
much
the
more
so
because
of
my
misfortunes
think
how
good
he
must
be
how
strong
must
be
his
attachment
when
he
comes
down
here
after
you
in
this
way
but
i
have
to
think
of
my
own
feelings
you
know
you
like
him
you
have
told
me
so
and
only
fancy
what
mamma
will
feel
such
a
position
and
the
man
so
excellent
everybody
says
that
he
has
a
fault
in
any
way
i
hate
people
without
faults
oh
nora
nora
that
is
foolish
there
there
you
must
go
down
pray
pray
do
not
let
any
absurd
fancy
stand
in
your
way
and
destroy
everything
it
will
never
come
again
nora
and
only
think
it
is
all
now
your
own
if
you
will
only
whisper
one
word
ah
one
word
and
that
a
falsehood
no
no
say
you
will
try
to
love
him
and
that
will
be
enough
and
you
do
love
him
do
i
yes
you
do
it
is
only
the
opposition
of
your
nature
that
makes
you
fight
against
him
will
you
go
now
let
me
be
for
two
minutes
by
myself
said
nora
and
then
i
come
down
tell
him
that
i
coming
trevelyan
stooped
over
her
kissed
her
and
then
left
her
nora
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
stood
upright
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
held
her
hands
up
to
her
forehead
she
had
been
far
from
thinking
when
she
was
considering
the
matter
easily
among
the
hillocks
that
the
necessity
for
an
absolute
decision
would
come
upon
her
so
instantaneously
she
had
told
herself
only
this
morning
that
it
would
be
wise
to
accept
the
man
if
he
should
ever
ask
a
second
time
and
he
had
come
already
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
in
the
village
while
she
had
been
thinking
whether
he
would
ever
come
across
her
path
again
she
thought
that
it
would
have
been
easier
for
her
now
to
have
gone
down
with
a
yes
in
her
mouth
if
her
sister
had
not
pressed
her
so
hard
to
say
that
yes
the
very
pressure
from
her
sister
seemed
to
imply
that
such
pressure
ought
to
be
resisted
why
should
there
have
been
pressure
unless
there
were
reasons
against
her
marrying
him
and
yet
if
she
chose
to
take
him
who
would
have
a
right
to
complain
of
her
hugh
stanbury
had
never
spoken
to
her
a
word
that
would
justify
her
in
even
supposing
that
he
would
consider
himself
to
be
all
others
of
her
friends
would
certainly
rejoice
would
applaud
her
pat
her
on
the
back
cover
her
with
caresses
and
tell
her
that
she
had
been
born
under
a
happy
star
and
she
did
like
the
man
nay
she
thought
she
loved
him
she
withdrew
her
hands
from
her
brow
assured
herself
that
her
lot
in
life
was
cast
and
with
hurrying
fingers
attempted
to
smooth
her
hair
and
to
arrange
her
ribbons
before
the
glass
she
would
go
to
the
encounter
boldly
and
accept
him
honestly
it
was
her
duty
to
do
so
what
might
she
not
do
for
brothers
and
sisters
as
the
wife
of
lord
peterborough
of
monkhams
she
saw
that
that
arrangement
before
the
glass
could
be
of
no
service
and
she
stepped
quickly
to
the
door
if
he
did
not
like
her
as
she
was
he
need
not
ask
her
her
mind
was
made
up
and
she
would
do
it
but
as
she
went
down
the
stairs
to
the
room
in
which
she
knew
that
he
was
waiting
for
her
there
came
over
her
a
cold
feeling
of
almost
of
disgrace
i
do
not
care
she
said
i
know
that
i
right
she
opened
the
door
quickly
that
there
might
be
no
further
doubt
and
found
that
she
was
alone
with
him
miss
rowley
he
said
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
that
i
am
persecuting
you
i
have
no
right
to
think
that
she
answered
i
tell
you
why
i
have
come
my
dear
father
who
has
always
been
my
best
friend
is
very
ill
he
is
at
naples
and
i
must
go
to
him
he
is
very
old
you
know
over
eighty
and
will
never
live
to
come
back
to
england
from
what
i
hear
i
think
it
probable
that
i
may
remain
with
him
till
everything
is
over
i
did
not
know
that
he
was
so
old
as
that
they
say
that
he
can
hardly
live
above
a
month
or
two
he
will
never
see
my
wife
if
i
can
have
a
wife
but
i
should
like
to
tell
him
if
it
were
possible
that
that
i
understand
you
mr
glascock
i
told
you
that
i
should
come
to
you
again
and
as
i
may
possibly
linger
at
naples
all
the
winter
i
could
not
go
without
seeing
you
miss
rowley
may
i
hope
that
you
can
love
me
she
did
not
answer
him
a
word
but
stood
looking
away
from
him
with
her
hands
clasped
together
had
he
asked
her
whether
she
would
be
his
wife
it
is
possible
that
the
answer
which
she
had
prepared
would
have
been
spoken
but
he
had
put
the
question
in
another
form
did
she
love
him
if
she
could
only
bring
herself
to
say
that
she
could
love
him
she
might
be
lady
of
monkhams
before
the
next
summer
had
come
round
nora
he
said
do
you
think
that
you
can
love
me
no
she
said
and
there
was
something
almost
of
fierceness
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
as
she
answered
him
and
must
that
be
your
final
answer
to
me
glascock
what
can
i
say
she
replied
i
will
tell
you
the
honest
truth
i
will
tell
you
everything
i
came
into
this
room
determined
to
accept
you
but
you
are
so
good
and
so
kind
and
so
upright
that
i
can
not
tell
you
a
falsehood
i
do
not
love
you
i
ought
not
to
take
what
you
offer
me
if
i
did
it
would
be
because
you
are
rich
and
a
lord
and
not
because
i
love
you
i
love
some
one
else
there
pray
pray
do
not
tell
of
me
but
i
do
then
she
flung
away
from
him
and
hid
her
face
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
out
of
the
light
her
lover
stood
silent
not
knowing
how
to
go
on
with
the
conversation
not
knowing
how
to
bring
it
to
an
end
after
what
she
had
now
said
to
him
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
press
her
further
it
was
almost
impossible
that
he
should
wish
to
do
so
when
a
lady
is
frank
enough
to
declare
that
her
heart
is
not
her
own
to
give
a
man
can
hardly
wish
to
make
further
prayer
for
the
gift
if
so
he
said
of
course
i
have
nothing
to
hope
she
was
sobbing
and
could
not
answer
him
she
was
half
repentant
partly
proud
of
what
she
had
done
half
repentant
in
that
she
had
lost
what
had
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
good
and
full
of
remorse
in
that
she
had
so
unnecessarily
told
her
secret
perhaps
said
he
i
ought
to
assure
you
that
what
you
have
told
me
shall
never
be
repeated
by
my
lips
she
thanked
him
for
this
by
a
motion
of
her
head
and
hand
not
by
words
and
then
he
was
gone
how
he
managed
to
bid
adieu
to
stanbury
and
her
sister
or
whether
he
saw
them
as
he
left
the
house
she
never
knew
in
her
corner
of
the
sofa
weeping
in
the
dark
partly
proud
and
partly
repentant
she
remained
till
her
sister
came
to
her
emily
she
said
jumping
up
say
nothing
about
it
not
a
word
it
is
of
no
use
the
thing
is
done
and
over
and
let
it
altogether
be
forgotten
it
is
done
and
over
certainly
said
trevelyan
exactly
and
i
suppose
a
girl
may
do
what
she
likes
with
herself
in
that
way
if
i
choose
to
decline
to
take
anything
that
is
pleasant
and
nice
and
comfortable
nobody
has
a
right
to
scold
me
and
i
wo
be
scolded
but
my
child
who
is
scolding
you
you
mean
to
scold
me
but
it
is
of
no
use
the
man
has
gone
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
nothing
that
you
can
say
or
i
can
think
will
bring
him
back
again
i
do
want
anybody
to
tell
me
that
it
would
be
better
to
be
lady
peterborough
with
everything
that
the
world
has
to
give
than
to
live
here
without
a
soul
to
speak
to
and
to
have
to
go
back
to
those
horrible
islands
next
year
you
ca
think
that
i
am
very
comfortable
but
what
did
you
say
to
him
nora
what
did
i
say
to
him
what
could
i
say
to
him
why
did
he
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
without
saying
anything
about
love
he
asked
me
if
i
loved
him
of
course
i
do
love
him
i
would
have
said
i
did
but
it
stuck
in
my
throat
i
am
willing
enough
i
believe
to
sell
myself
to
the
devil
but
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
never
mind
it
done
and
now
i
go
to
bed
she
did
go
to
bed
and
trevelyan
explained
to
the
two
ladies
as
much
as
was
necessary
of
what
had
occurred
when
stanbury
came
to
understand
that
the
gentleman
who
had
been
closeted
with
her
would
probably
in
a
few
months
be
a
lord
himself
that
he
was
a
very
rich
man
a
member
of
parliament
and
one
of
those
who
are
decidedly
born
with
gold
spoons
in
their
mouths
and
understood
also
that
nora
rowley
had
refused
him
she
was
lost
in
amazement
glascock
was
about
forty
years
of
age
and
appeared
to
nora
rowley
who
was
nearly
twenty
years
his
junior
to
be
almost
an
old
man
but
to
stanbury
who
was
over
sixty
glascock
seemed
to
be
quite
in
the
flower
of
his
age
the
bald
place
at
the
top
of
his
head
simply
showed
that
he
had
passed
his
boyhood
and
the
grey
hairs
at
the
back
of
his
whiskers
were
no
more
than
outward
signs
of
manly
discretion
she
could
not
understand
why
any
girl
should
refuse
such
an
offer
unless
the
man
were
himself
bad
in
morals
or
in
temper
but
trevelyan
had
told
her
while
nora
and
glascock
were
closeted
together
that
he
was
believed
by
them
all
to
be
good
and
gentle
nevertheless
she
felt
a
considerable
increase
of
respect
for
a
young
lady
who
had
refused
the
eldest
son
of
a
lord
priscilla
when
she
heard
what
had
occurred
expressed
to
her
mother
a
moderated
approval
according
to
her
views
a
girl
would
much
more
often
be
right
to
refuse
an
offer
of
marriage
than
to
accept
it
let
him
who
made
the
offer
be
who
he
might
and
the
fact
of
the
man
having
been
sent
away
with
a
refusal
somewhat
softened
priscilla
anger
at
his
coming
there
at
all
i
suppose
he
is
a
goose
said
she
to
her
mother
and
i
hope
there
wo
be
any
more
of
this
kind
running
after
them
while
they
are
with
us
nora
when
she
was
alone
wept
till
her
heart
was
almost
broken
it
was
done
and
the
man
was
gone
and
the
thing
was
over
she
had
quite
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
world
to
realise
perfectly
the
difference
between
such
a
position
as
that
which
had
been
offered
to
her
and
the
position
which
in
all
probability
she
would
now
be
called
upon
to
fill
she
had
had
her
chance
and
fortune
had
placed
great
things
at
her
disposal
it
must
be
said
of
her
also
that
the
great
things
which
fortune
had
offered
to
her
were
treasures
very
valuable
in
her
eyes
whether
it
be
right
and
wise
to
covet
or
to
despise
wealth
and
rank
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
she
coveted
them
she
had
been
instructed
to
believe
in
them
and
she
did
believe
in
them
in
some
mysterious
manner
of
which
she
herself
knew
nothing
taught
by
some
preceptor
the
nobility
of
whose
lessons
she
had
not
recognised
though
she
had
accepted
them
she
had
learned
other
things
also
to
revere
truth
and
love
and
to
be
ambitious
as
regarded
herself
of
conferring
the
gift
of
her
whole
heart
upon
some
one
whom
she
could
worship
as
a
hero
she
had
spoken
the
simple
truth
when
she
had
told
her
sister
that
she
had
been
willing
to
sell
herself
to
the
devil
but
that
she
had
failed
in
her
attempt
to
execute
the
contract
but
now
as
she
lay
weeping
on
her
bed
tearing
herself
with
remorse
picturing
to
herself
in
the
most
vivid
colours
all
that
she
had
thrown
away
telling
herself
of
all
that
she
might
have
done
and
all
that
she
might
have
been
had
she
not
allowed
the
insane
folly
of
a
moment
to
get
the
better
of
her
she
received
little
or
no
comfort
from
the
reflection
that
she
had
been
true
to
her
better
instincts
she
had
told
the
man
that
she
had
refused
him
because
she
loved
hugh
stanbury
at
least
as
far
as
she
could
remember
what
had
passed
she
had
so
told
him
and
how
mean
it
was
of
her
to
allow
herself
to
be
actuated
by
an
insane
passion
for
a
man
who
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
love
and
how
silly
of
her
afterwards
to
confess
it
of
what
service
could
such
a
passion
be
to
her
life
even
were
it
returned
she
could
not
marry
such
a
one
as
hugh
stanbury
she
knew
enough
of
herself
to
be
quite
sure
that
were
he
to
ask
her
to
do
so
she
would
refuse
him
better
go
and
be
scorched
and
bored
to
death
and
buried
at
the
mandarins
than
attempt
to
regulate
a
poor
household
which
as
soon
as
she
made
one
of
its
number
would
be
on
the
sure
road
to
ruin
for
a
moment
there
came
upon
her
not
a
thought
hardly
an
idea
something
of
a
waking
dream
that
she
would
write
to
glascock
and
withdraw
all
that
she
had
said
were
she
to
do
so
he
would
probably
despise
her
and
tell
her
that
he
despised
her
but
there
might
be
a
chance
it
was
possible
that
such
a
declaration
would
bring
him
back
to
her
and
did
it
not
bring
him
back
to
her
she
would
only
be
where
she
was
a
poor
lost
shipwrecked
creature
who
had
flung
herself
upon
the
rocks
and
thrown
away
her
only
chance
of
a
prosperous
voyage
across
the
ocean
of
life
her
only
chance
for
she
was
not
like
other
girls
who
at
any
rate
remain
on
the
scene
of
action
and
may
refit
their
spars
and
still
win
their
way
for
there
were
to
be
no
more
seasons
in
london
no
more
living
in
curzon
street
no
renewed
power
of
entering
the
and
crowded
staircases
in
which
wealthy
lovers
can
be
conquered
a
great
prospect
had
been
given
to
her
and
she
had
flung
it
aside
that
letter
of
retractation
was
however
quite
out
of
the
question
the
reader
must
not
suppose
that
she
had
ever
thought
that
she
could
write
it
she
thought
of
nothing
but
of
coming
misery
and
remorse
in
her
wretchedness
she
fancied
that
she
had
absolutely
disclosed
to
the
man
who
loved
her
the
name
of
him
whom
she
had
been
mad
enough
to
say
that
she
loved
but
what
did
it
matter
let
it
be
as
it
might
she
was
destroyed
the
next
morning
she
came
down
to
breakfast
pale
as
a
ghost
and
they
who
saw
her
knew
at
once
that
she
had
done
that
which
had
made
her
a
wretched
woman
chapter

the
stanbury
correspondence
half
an
hour
after
the
proper
time
when
the
others
had
finished
their
tea
and
bread
and
butter
nora
rowley
came
down
among
them
pale
as
a
ghost
her
sister
had
gone
to
her
while
she
was
dressing
but
she
had
declared
that
she
would
prefer
to
be
alone
she
would
be
down
directly
she
had
said
and
had
completed
her
toilet
without
even
the
assistance
of
her
maid
she
drank
her
cup
of
tea
and
pretended
to
eat
her
toast
and
then
sat
herself
down
very
wretchedly
to
think
of
it
all
again
it
had
been
all
within
her
grasp
all
of
which
she
had
ever
dreamed
and
now
it
was
gone
each
of
her
three
companions
strove
from
time
to
time
to
draw
her
into
conversation
but
she
seemed
to
be
resolute
in
her
refusal
at
first
till
her
utter
prostration
had
become
a
fact
plainly
recognised
by
them
all
she
made
some
little
attempt
at
an
answer
when
a
direct
question
was
asked
of
her
but
after
a
while
she
only
shook
her
head
and
was
silent
giving
way
to
absolute
despair
late
in
the
evening
she
went
out
into
the
garden
and
priscilla
followed
her
it
was
now
the
end
of
july
and
the
summer
was
in
its
glory
the
ladies
during
the
day
would
remain
in
the
with
the
windows
open
and
the
blinds
down
and
would
sit
in
the
evening
reading
and
working
or
perhaps
pretending
to
read
and
work
under
the
shade
of
a
cedar
which
stood
upon
the
lawn
no
retirement
could
possibly
be
more
secluded
than
was
that
of
the
garden
of
the
clock
house
no
stranger
could
see
into
it
or
hear
sounds
from
out
of
it
though
it
was
not
extensive
it
was
so
well
furnished
with
those
charming
garden
shrubs
which
in
congenial
soils
become
large
trees
that
one
party
of
wanderers
might
seem
to
be
lost
from
another
amidst
its
walls
on
this
evening
stanbury
and
trevelyan
had
gone
out
as
usual
but
priscilla
had
remained
with
nora
rowley
after
a
while
nora
also
got
up
and
went
through
the
window
all
alone
priscilla
having
waited
for
a
few
minutes
followed
her
and
caught
her
in
a
long
green
walk
that
led
round
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
what
makes
you
so
wretched
she
said
why
do
you
say
i
am
wretched
because
it
so
visible
how
is
one
to
go
on
living
with
you
all
day
and
not
notice
it
i
wish
you
would
notice
it
i
do
think
it
kind
of
you
to
notice
it
if
i
wanted
to
talk
of
it
i
would
say
so
it
is
better
generally
to
speak
of
a
trouble
than
to
keep
it
to
oneself
said
priscilla
all
the
same
i
would
prefer
not
to
speak
of
mine
said
nora
then
they
parted
one
going
one
way
and
one
the
other
and
priscilla
was
certainly
angry
at
the
reception
which
had
been
given
to
the
sympathy
which
she
had
proffered
the
next
day
passed
almost
without
a
word
spoken
between
the
two
stanbury
had
not
ventured
as
yet
to
mention
to
her
guest
the
subject
of
the
rejected
lover
and
had
not
even
said
much
on
the
subject
to
trevelyan
between
the
two
sisters
there
had
been
of
course
some
discussion
on
the
matter
it
was
impossible
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
pass
without
it
but
such
discussions
always
resulted
in
an
assertion
on
the
part
of
nora
that
she
would
not
be
scolded
trevelyan
was
very
tender
with
her
and
made
no
attempt
to
scold
her
tried
at
last
simply
to
console
her
but
nora
was
so
continually
at
work
scolding
herself
that
every
word
spoken
to
her
on
the
subject
of
glascock
visit
seemed
to
her
to
carry
with
it
a
rebuke
but
on
the
second
day
she
herself
accosted
priscilla
stanbury
come
into
the
garden
she
said
when
they
two
were
for
a
moment
alone
together
i
want
to
speak
to
you
priscilla
without
answering
folded
up
her
work
and
put
on
her
hat
come
down
to
the
green
walk
said
nora
i
was
savage
to
you
last
night
and
i
want
to
beg
your
pardon
you
were
savage
said
priscilla
smiling
and
you
shall
have
my
pardon
who
would
not
pardon
you
any
offence
if
you
asked
it
i
am
so
miserable
she
said
but
why
i
do
know
i
ca
tell
and
it
is
of
no
use
talking
about
it
now
for
it
is
all
over
but
i
ought
not
to
have
been
cross
to
you
and
i
am
very
sorry
that
does
not
signify
a
straw
only
so
far
that
when
i
have
been
cross
and
have
begged
a
person
pardon
which
i
do
do
as
often
as
i
ought
i
always
feel
that
it
begets
kindness
if
i
could
help
you
in
your
trouble
i
would
you
ca
fetch
him
back
again
you
mean
glascock
shall
i
go
and
try
nora
smiled
and
shook
her
head
i
wonder
what
he
would
say
if
you
asked
him
but
if
he
came
i
should
do
the
same
thing
i
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
you
have
done
my
dear
i
only
see
that
you
mope
about
and
are
more
down
in
the
mouth
than
any
one
ought
to
be
unless
some
great
trouble
has
come
a
great
trouble
has
come
i
suppose
you
have
had
your
choice
either
to
accept
your
lover
or
to
reject
him
no
i
have
not
had
my
choice
it
seems
to
me
that
no
one
has
dictated
to
you
or
at
least
that
you
have
obeyed
no
dictation
of
course
i
ca
explain
it
to
you
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
if
you
mean
that
you
regret
what
you
have
done
because
you
have
been
false
to
the
man
i
can
sympathise
with
you
no
one
has
ever
a
right
to
be
false
and
if
you
are
repenting
a
falsehood
i
will
willingly
help
you
to
eat
your
ashes
and
to
wear
your
sackcloth
but
if
you
are
repenting
a
truth
i
am
then
you
must
eat
your
ashes
by
yourself
for
me
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
ever
be
able
to
digest
them
i
do
not
want
anybody
to
help
me
said
nora
proudly
nobody
can
help
you
if
i
understand
the
matter
rightly
you
have
got
to
get
the
better
of
your
own
covetousness
and
evil
desires
and
you
are
in
the
fair
way
to
get
the
better
of
them
if
you
have
already
refused
to
be
this
man
wife
because
you
could
not
bring
yourself
to
commit
the
sin
of
marrying
him
when
you
did
not
love
him
i
suppose
that
is
about
the
truth
of
it
and
indeed
indeed
i
do
sympathise
with
you
if
you
have
done
that
though
it
is
no
more
than
the
plainest
duty
i
will
love
you
for
it
one
finds
so
few
people
that
will
do
any
duty
that
taxes
their
but
he
did
not
ask
me
to
marry
him
then
i
do
not
understand
anything
about
it
he
asked
me
to
love
him
but
he
meant
you
to
be
his
wife
oh
yes
he
meant
that
of
course
and
what
did
you
say
asked
priscilla
that
i
did
love
him
replied
nora
and
that
was
the
truth
yes
it
was
the
truth
and
what
do
you
regret
that
you
did
tell
him
a
lie
no
not
that
said
nora
slowly
what
then
you
can
not
regret
that
you
have
not
basely
deceived
a
man
who
has
treated
you
with
a
loving
generosity
they
walked
on
silent
for
a
few
yards
and
then
priscilla
repeated
her
question
you
can
not
mean
that
you
are
sorry
that
you
did
not
persuade
yourself
to
do
evil
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
the
islands
and
to
lose
myself
there
and
to
be
nobody
that
is
what
i
mean
and
i
might
have
been
so
much
could
one
step
from
the
very
highest
rung
of
the
ladder
to
the
very
lowest
and
not
feel
it
but
you
have
gone
up
the
ladder
if
you
only
knew
it
said
priscilla
there
was
a
choice
given
to
you
between
the
foulest
mire
of
the
clay
of
the
world
and
the
of
the
very
god
you
have
chosen
the
and
you
are
crying
after
the
clay
i
can
not
pity
you
but
i
can
esteem
you
and
love
you
and
believe
in
you
and
i
do
you
get
yourself
right
at
last
and
there
my
hand
on
it
if
you
take
it
nora
took
the
hand
that
was
offered
to
her
held
it
in
her
own
for
some
seconds
and
then
walked
back
to
the
house
and
up
to
her
own
room
in
silence
the
post
used
to
come
into
nuncombe
putney
at
about
eight
in
the
morning
carried
thither
by
a
man
who
rode
a
donkey
there
is
a
general
understanding
that
the
men
in
country
parishes
should
be
employed
as
postmen
owing
to
the
great
steadiness
of
demeanour
which
a
wooden
leg
is
generally
found
to
produce
it
may
be
that
such
men
are
slower
in
their
operations
than
would
be
biped
postmen
but
as
all
private
employers
of
labour
demand
labourers
with
two
legs
it
is
well
that
the
lame
and
halt
should
find
a
refuge
in
the
less
exacting
service
of
the
government
the
man
who
rode
his
donkey
into
nuncombe
putney
would
reach
his
not
above
half
an
hour
after
his
proper
time
but
he
was
very
slow
in
stumping
round
the
village
and
seldom
reached
the
clock
house
much
before
ten
on
a
certain
morning
two
or
three
days
after
the
conversation
just
recorded
it
was
past
ten
when
he
brought
two
letters
to
the
door
one
for
trevelyan
and
one
for
stanbury
the
ladies
had
finished
their
breakfast
and
were
seated
together
at
an
open
window
as
was
usual
the
letters
were
given
into
priscilla
hands
and
the
newspaper
which
accompanied
them
into
those
of
trevelyan
its
undoubted
owner
when
her
letter
was
handed
to
her
she
looked
at
the
address
closely
and
then
walked
away
with
it
into
her
own
room
i
think
it
from
louis
said
nora
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
if
so
he
is
telling
her
to
come
back
mamma
this
is
for
you
said
priscilla
it
is
from
aunt
stanbury
i
know
her
handwriting
from
your
aunt
what
can
she
be
writing
about
there
is
something
wrong
with
dorothy
stanbury
held
the
letter
but
did
not
open
it
you
had
better
read
it
my
dear
if
she
is
ill
pray
let
her
come
home
but
the
letter
spoke
of
nothing
amiss
as
regarded
dorothy
and
did
not
indeed
even
mention
dorothy
name
luckily
priscilla
read
the
letter
in
silence
for
it
was
an
angry
letter
what
is
it
priscilla
why
do
you
tell
me
is
anything
wrong
said
stanbury
nothing
is
wrong
mamma
except
that
my
aunt
is
a
silly
woman
goodness
me
what
is
it
it
is
a
family
matter
said
nora
smiling
and
i
will
go
what
can
it
be
demanded
stanbury
again
as
soon
as
nora
had
left
the
room
you
shall
hear
what
it
can
be
i
will
read
it
you
said
priscilla
it
seems
to
me
that
of
all
the
women
that
ever
lived
my
aunt
stanbury
is
the
most
prejudiced
the
most
unjust
and
the
most
given
to
evil
thinking
of
her
neighbours
this
is
what
she
has
thought
fit
to
write
to
you
mamma
then
priscilla
read
her
aunt
letter
which
was
as
follows
the
close
exeter
july
dear
sister
stanbury
i
am
informed
that
the
lady
who
is
living
with
you
because
she
could
not
continue
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
her
lawful
husband
has
received
a
visit
at
your
house
from
a
gentleman
who
was
named
as
her
lover
before
she
left
her
own
i
am
given
to
understand
that
it
was
because
of
this
gentleman
visits
to
her
in
london
and
because
she
would
not
give
up
seeing
him
that
her
husband
would
not
live
with
her
any
longer
but
the
man
has
never
been
here
at
all
said
stanbury
in
dismay
of
course
he
has
not
been
here
but
let
me
go
on
i
have
got
nothing
to
do
with
your
visitors
continued
the
letter
and
i
should
not
interfere
but
for
the
credit
of
the
family
there
ought
to
be
somebody
to
explain
to
you
that
much
of
the
abominable
disgrace
of
the
whole
proceeding
will
rest
upon
you
if
you
permit
such
goings
on
in
your
house
i
suppose
it
is
your
house
at
any
rate
you
are
regarded
as
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
and
it
is
for
you
to
tell
the
lady
that
she
must
go
elsewhere
i
do
hope
that
you
have
done
so
or
at
least
that
you
will
do
so
now
it
is
intolerable
that
the
widow
of
my
brother
a
clergyman
should
harbour
a
lady
who
is
separated
from
her
husband
and
who
receives
visits
from
a
gentleman
who
is
reputed
to
be
her
lover
i
wonder
much
that
your
eldest
daughter
should
countenance
such
a
proceeding
yours
truly
jemima
stanbury
stanbury
when
the
letter
had
been
read
to
her
held
up
both
her
hands
in
despair
dear
dear
she
exclaimed
oh
dear
she
had
such
pleasure
in
writing
it
said
priscilla
that
one
ought
hardly
to
begrudge
it
her
the
blackest
spot
in
the
character
of
priscilla
stanbury
was
her
hatred
for
her
aunt
in
exeter
she
knew
that
her
aunt
had
high
qualities
and
yet
she
hated
her
aunt
she
was
well
aware
that
her
aunt
was
regarded
as
a
shining
light
by
very
many
good
people
in
the
county
and
yet
she
hated
her
aunt
she
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
her
aunt
had
been
generous
to
her
brother
and
was
now
very
generous
to
her
sister
and
yet
she
hated
her
aunt
it
was
now
a
triumph
to
her
that
her
aunt
had
fallen
into
so
terrible
a
quagmire
and
she
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
let
the
sinning
old
woman
easily
out
of
it
it
is
as
pretty
a
specimen
she
said
as
i
ever
knew
of
malice
and
combined
do
use
such
hard
words
my
dear
look
at
her
words
to
us
said
priscilla
what
business
has
she
to
talk
to
you
about
the
credit
of
the
family
and
abominable
disgrace
you
have
held
your
head
up
in
poverty
while
she
has
been
rolling
in
money
she
has
been
very
good
to
hugh
and
now
to
dorothy
if
i
were
dorothy
i
would
have
none
of
her
goodness
she
likes
some
one
to
trample
on
some
one
of
the
name
to
patronise
she
trample
on
you
and
me
mamma
then
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
what
should
be
done
or
rather
a
discourse
in
which
priscilla
explained
what
she
thought
fit
to
do
nothing
she
decided
should
be
said
to
trevelyan
on
the
subject
but
an
answer
should
be
sent
to
aunt
stanbury
priscilla
herself
would
write
this
answer
and
herself
would
sign
it
there
was
some
difference
of
opinion
on
this
point
as
stanbury
thought
that
if
she
might
be
allowed
to
put
her
name
to
it
even
though
priscilla
should
write
it
the
wording
of
it
would
be
made
in
some
degree
mild
to
suit
her
own
character
but
her
daughter
was
imperative
and
she
gave
way
it
shall
be
mild
enough
in
words
said
priscilla
and
very
short
then
she
wrote
her
letter
as
follows
nuncombe
putney
august
dear
aunt
stanbury
you
have
found
a
mare
nest
the
gentleman
you
speak
of
has
never
been
here
at
all
and
the
people
who
bring
you
news
have
probably
hoaxed
you
i
do
think
that
mamma
has
ever
disgraced
the
family
and
you
can
have
no
reason
for
thinking
that
she
ever
will
you
should
at
any
rate
be
sure
of
what
you
are
saying
before
you
make
such
cruel
accusations
yours
truly
priscilla
stanbury
another
gentleman
did
call
here
not
to
see
trevelyan
but
i
suppose
mamma
house
need
not
be
closed
against
all
visitors
poor
dorothy
had
passed
evil
hours
from
the
moment
in
which
her
aunt
had
so
far
certified
herself
as
to
colonel
osborne
visit
to
nuncombe
as
to
make
her
feel
it
to
be
incumbent
on
her
to
interfere
after
much
consideration
miss
stanbury
had
told
her
niece
the
dreadful
news
and
had
told
also
what
she
intended
to
do
dorothy
who
was
in
truth
horrified
at
the
iniquity
of
the
fact
which
was
related
and
who
never
dreamed
of
doubting
the
truth
of
her
information
hardly
knew
how
to
interpose
i
am
sure
mamma
wo
let
there
be
anything
wrong
she
had
said
and
you
do
call
this
wrong
said
miss
stanbury
in
a
tone
of
indignation
but
perhaps
mamma
will
tell
them
to
go
i
hope
she
will
i
hope
she
has
but
he
was
allowed
to
be
there
for
hours
and
now
three
days
have
passed
and
there
is
no
sign
of
anything
being
done
he
came
and
went
and
may
come
again
when
he
pleases
still
dorothy
pleaded
i
shall
do
my
duty
said
miss
stanbury
i
am
quite
sure
mamma
will
do
nothing
wrong
said
dorothy
but
the
letter
was
written
and
sent
and
the
answer
to
the
letter
reached
the
house
in
the
close
in
due
time
when
miss
stanbury
had
read
and
the
very
short
reply
which
her
niece
had
written
she
became
at
first
pale
with
dismay
and
then
red
with
renewed
vigour
and
obstinacy
she
had
made
herself
as
she
thought
quite
certain
of
her
facts
before
she
had
acted
on
her
information
there
was
some
equivocation
some
most
unworthy
deceit
in
priscilla
letter
or
could
it
be
possible
that
she
herself
had
been
mistaken
another
gentleman
had
been
there
not
however
with
the
object
of
seeing
trevelyan
so
said
priscilla
but
she
had
made
herself
sure
that
the
man
in
question
was
a
man
from
london
a
man
from
london
who
had
specially
asked
for
trevelyan
and
who
had
at
once
been
known
to
clegg
at
the
lessboro
inn
to
be
trevelyan
lover
miss
stanbury
was
very
unhappy
and
at
last
sent
for
giles
hickbody
giles
hickbody
had
never
pretended
to
know
the
name
he
had
seen
the
man
and
had
described
him
quite
a
swell
and
a
and
one
be
up
to
anything
but
not
a
young
no
not
just
a
young
zartainly
he
was
again
now
and
said
that
all
he
knew
about
the
man
name
was
that
there
was
a
handle
to
it
this
was
ended
by
miss
stanbury
sending
him
down
to
lessboro
to
learn
the
very
name
of
the
gentleman
and
by
his
coming
back
with
that
of
the
honourable
george
glascock
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
they
says
now
as
he
was
arter
the
other
young
said
giles
hickbody
then
was
the
confusion
of
miss
stanbury
complete
it
was
late
when
giles
returned
from
lessboro
and
nothing
could
be
done
that
night
it
was
too
late
to
write
a
letter
for
the
next
morning
post
miss
stanbury
who
was
as
proud
of
her
own
discrimination
as
she
was
just
and
true
felt
that
a
day
of
humiliation
had
indeed
come
for
her
she
hated
priscilla
almost
as
vigorously
as
priscilla
hated
her
to
priscilla
she
would
not
write
to
own
her
fault
but
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
confess
it
to
stanbury
it
was
incumbent
on
her
also
to
confess
it
to
dorothy
all
that
night
she
did
not
sleep
and
the
next
morning
she
went
about
abashed
wretched
hardly
mistress
of
her
own
maids
she
must
confess
it
also
to
martha
and
martha
would
be
very
stern
to
her
martha
had
the
whole
story
of
the
lover
seeming
to
think
that
there
could
be
no
reasonable
objection
to
a
lover
past
fifty
dorothy
she
said
at
last
about
noon
i
have
been
over
hasty
about
your
mother
and
this
man
i
am
sorry
for
it
and
must
beg
everybody
pardon
i
knew
mamma
would
do
nothing
wrong
said
dorothy
to
do
wrong
is
human
and
she
i
suppose
is
not
more
free
than
others
but
in
this
matter
i
was
misinformed
i
shall
write
and
beg
her
pardon
and
now
i
beg
your
pardon
not
mine
aunt
stanbury
yes
yours
and
your
mother
and
the
lady
also
for
against
her
has
the
fault
been
most
grievous
i
shall
write
to
your
mother
and
express
my
contrition
she
put
off
the
evil
hour
of
writing
as
long
as
she
could
but
before
dinner
the
painful
letter
had
been
written
and
carried
by
herself
to
the
post
it
was
as
follows
the
close
august
dear
sister
stanbury
i
have
now
learned
that
the
information
was
false
on
which
my
former
letter
was
based
i
am
heartily
sorry
for
any
annoyance
i
may
have
given
you
i
can
only
inform
you
that
my
intentions
were
good
and
upright
nevertheless
i
humbly
beg
your
pardon
yours
truly
jemima
stanbury
stanbury
when
she
received
this
was
inclined
to
let
the
matter
drop
that
her
should
express
such
abject
contrition
was
to
her
such
a
lowering
of
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
that
the
apology
conveyed
to
her
more
pain
than
pleasure
she
could
not
hinder
herself
from
sympathising
with
all
that
her
had
felt
when
she
had
found
herself
called
upon
to
humiliate
herself
but
it
was
not
so
with
priscilla
stanbury
did
not
observe
that
her
daughter
name
was
scrupulously
avoided
in
the
apology
but
priscilla
observed
it
she
would
not
let
the
matter
drop
without
an
attempt
at
the
last
word
she
therefore
wrote
back
again
as
follows
nuncombe
putney
august
dear
aunt
stanbury
i
am
glad
you
have
satisfied
yourself
about
the
gentleman
who
has
so
much
disquieted
you
i
do
not
know
that
the
whole
affair
would
be
worth
a
moment
consideration
were
it
not
that
mamma
and
i
living
as
we
do
so
secluded
a
life
are
peculiarly
apt
to
feel
any
attack
upon
our
good
name
which
is
pretty
nearly
all
that
is
left
to
us
if
ever
there
were
women
who
should
be
free
from
attack
at
any
rate
from
those
of
their
own
family
we
are
such
women
we
never
interfere
with
you
or
with
anybody
and
i
think
you
might
abstain
from
harassing
us
by
accusations
pray
do
not
write
to
mamma
in
such
a
strain
again
unless
you
are
quite
sure
of
your
ground
yours
truly
priscilla
stanbury
impudent
said
miss
stanbury
to
martha
when
she
had
read
the
letter
impudent
vixen
she
was
provoked
miss
said
martha
well
yes
yes
and
i
suppose
it
is
right
that
you
should
tell
me
of
it
i
dare
say
it
is
part
of
what
i
ought
to
bear
for
being
an
old
fool
and
too
cautious
about
my
own
flesh
and
blood
i
will
bear
it
there
i
was
wrong
and
i
will
say
that
i
have
been
justly
punished
there
there
how
very
much
would
miss
stanbury
tone
have
been
changed
had
she
known
that
at
that
very
moment
colonel
osborne
was
eating
his
breakfast
at
crocket
inn
in
nuncombe
putney
chapter
xix
bozzle
the
illustration
when
trevelyan
had
gone
through
the
miserable
task
of
breaking
up
his
establishment
in
curzon
street
and
had
seen
all
his
furniture
packed
including
his
books
his
pictures
and
his
pet
italian
ornaments
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
go
and
live
somewhere
he
was
very
wretched
at
this
time
so
wretched
that
life
was
a
burden
to
him
he
was
a
man
who
loved
his
wife
to
whom
his
child
was
very
dear
and
he
was
one
too
to
whom
the
ordinary
comforts
of
domestic
life
were
attractive
and
necessary
there
are
men
to
whom
release
from
the
constraint
imposed
by
family
ties
will
be
at
any
rate
for
a
time
felt
as
a
release
but
he
was
not
such
a
man
there
was
no
delight
to
him
in
being
able
to
dine
at
his
club
and
being
free
to
go
whither
he
pleased
in
the
evening
as
it
was
it
pleased
him
to
go
no
whither
in
the
evenings
and
his
mornings
were
equally
blank
to
him
he
went
so
often
to
bideawhile
that
the
poor
old
lawyer
became
quite
tired
of
the
trevelyan
family
quarrel
even
lady
milborough
with
all
her
power
of
sympathising
began
to
feel
that
she
would
almost
prefer
on
any
morning
that
her
dear
young
friend
louis
trevelyan
should
not
be
announced
nevertheless
she
always
saw
him
when
he
came
and
administered
comfort
according
to
her
light
of
course
he
would
have
his
wife
back
before
long
that
was
the
only
consolation
she
was
able
to
offer
and
she
offered
it
so
often
that
he
began
gradually
to
feel
that
something
might
be
done
towards
bringing
about
so
desirable
an
event
after
what
had
occurred
they
could
not
live
again
in
curzon
street
nor
even
in
london
for
awhile
but
naples
was
open
to
them
lady
milborough
said
so
much
to
him
of
the
advantages
which
always
came
in
such
circumstances
from
going
to
naples
that
he
began
to
regard
such
a
trip
as
almost
the
natural
conclusion
of
his
adventure
but
then
there
came
that
very
difficult
question
what
step
should
be
first
taken
lady
milborough
proposed
that
he
should
go
boldly
down
to
nuncombe
putney
and
make
the
arrangement
she
will
only
be
too
glad
to
jump
into
your
arms
said
lady
milborough
trevelyan
thought
that
if
he
went
to
nuncombe
putney
his
wife
might
perhaps
jump
into
his
arms
but
what
would
come
after
that
how
would
he
stand
then
in
reference
to
his
authority
would
she
own
that
she
had
been
wrong
would
she
promise
to
behave
better
in
future
he
did
not
believe
that
she
was
yet
sufficiently
broken
in
spirit
to
make
any
such
promise
and
he
told
himself
again
and
again
that
it
would
be
absurd
in
him
to
allow
her
to
return
to
him
without
such
subjection
after
all
that
he
had
gone
through
in
defence
of
his
marital
rights
if
he
were
to
write
to
her
a
long
letter
argumentative
affectionate
exhaustive
it
might
be
better
he
was
inclined
to
believe
of
himself
that
he
was
good
at
writing
long
affectionate
argumentative
and
exhaustive
letters
but
he
would
not
do
even
this
as
yet
he
had
broken
up
his
house
and
scattered
all
his
domestic
gods
to
the
winds
because
she
had
behaved
badly
to
him
and
the
thing
done
was
too
important
to
allow
of
redress
being
found
so
easily
so
he
lived
on
a
wretched
life
in
london
he
could
hardly
endure
to
show
himself
at
his
club
fearing
that
every
one
would
be
talking
of
him
as
the
man
who
was
separated
from
his
wife
perhaps
as
the
man
of
whose
wife
colonel
osborne
was
the
dear
friend
no
doubt
for
a
day
or
two
there
had
been
much
of
such
conversation
but
it
had
died
away
from
the
club
long
before
his
consciousness
had
become
callous
at
first
he
had
gone
into
a
lodging
in
mayfair
but
this
had
been
but
for
a
day
or
two
after
that
he
had
taken
a
set
of
furnished
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
immediately
under
those
in
which
stanbury
lived
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
he
and
stanbury
were
very
much
thrown
together
as
trevelyan
would
always
talk
of
his
wife
this
was
rather
a
bore
but
our
friend
bore
with
it
and
would
even
continue
to
instruct
the
world
through
the
columns
of
the
while
trevelyan
was
descanting
on
the
peculiar
cruelty
of
his
own
position
i
wish
to
be
just
and
even
generous
and
i
do
love
her
with
all
my
heart
he
said
one
afternoon
when
hugh
was
very
hard
at
work
is
all
very
well
for
gentlemen
to
call
themselves
reformers
hugh
was
writing
have
these
gentlemen
ever
realised
to
themselves
the
meaning
of
that
word
we
think
that
they
have
never
done
so
as
long
as
of
course
you
love
her
said
hugh
with
his
eyes
still
on
the
paper
still
leaning
on
his
pen
but
finding
by
the
cessation
of
sound
that
trevelyan
had
paused
and
therefore
knowing
that
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
speak
as
much
as
ever
said
trevelyan
with
energy
long
as
they
follow
such
a
leader
in
such
a
cause
into
whichever
lobby
he
may
choose
to
take
them
exactly
so
exactly
said
stanbury
just
as
much
as
ever
you
are
not
listening
to
a
word
said
trevelyan
i
have
missed
a
single
expression
you
have
used
said
stanbury
but
a
fellow
has
to
do
two
things
at
a
time
when
he
on
the
daily
press
i
beg
your
pardon
for
interrupting
you
said
trevelyan
angrily
getting
up
taking
his
hat
and
stalking
off
to
the
house
of
lady
milborough
in
this
way
he
became
rather
a
bore
to
his
friends
he
could
not
divest
his
mind
of
the
injury
which
had
accrued
to
him
from
his
wife
conduct
nor
could
he
help
talking
of
the
grief
with
which
his
mind
was
laden
and
he
was
troubled
with
sore
suspicions
which
as
far
as
they
concerned
his
wife
had
certainly
not
been
merited
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
persisted
in
her
intimacy
with
colonel
osborne
in
a
manner
that
was
not
compatible
with
that
indifference
which
he
regarded
as
her
duty
why
had
she
written
to
him
and
received
letters
from
him
when
her
husband
had
plainly
told
her
that
any
such
communication
was
objectionable
she
had
done
so
and
as
far
as
trevelyan
could
remember
her
words
had
plainly
declared
that
she
would
continue
to
do
so
he
had
sent
her
away
into
the
most
remote
retirement
he
could
find
for
her
but
the
post
was
open
to
her
he
had
heard
much
of
stanbury
and
of
priscilla
from
his
friend
hugh
and
thoroughly
believed
that
his
wife
was
in
respectable
hands
but
what
was
to
prevent
colonel
osborne
from
going
after
her
if
he
chose
to
do
so
and
if
he
did
so
choose
stanbury
could
not
prevent
their
meeting
he
was
racked
with
jealousy
and
yet
he
did
not
cease
to
declare
to
himself
that
he
knew
his
wife
too
well
to
believe
that
she
would
sin
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
his
jealousy
but
he
tried
with
all
his
might
to
make
the
man
whom
he
hated
the
object
of
it
rather
than
the
woman
whom
he
loved
he
hated
colonel
osborne
with
all
his
heart
it
was
a
regret
to
him
that
the
days
of
duelling
were
over
so
that
he
could
not
shoot
the
man
and
yet
had
duelling
been
possible
to
him
colonel
osborne
had
done
nothing
that
would
have
justified
him
in
calling
his
enemy
out
or
would
even
have
enabled
him
to
do
so
with
any
chance
of
inducing
his
enemy
to
fight
circumstances
he
thought
were
cruel
to
him
beyond
compare
in
that
he
should
have
been
made
to
suffer
so
great
torment
without
having
any
of
the
satisfaction
of
revenge
even
lady
milborough
with
all
her
horror
as
to
the
colonel
could
not
tell
him
that
the
colonel
was
amenable
to
any
punishment
he
was
advised
that
he
must
take
his
wife
away
and
live
at
naples
because
of
this
man
that
he
must
banish
himself
entirely
if
he
chose
to
repossess
himself
of
his
wife
and
child
and
yet
nothing
could
be
done
to
the
unprincipled
rascal
by
whom
all
his
wrongs
and
sufferings
were
occasioned
thinking
it
very
possible
that
colonel
osborne
would
follow
his
wife
he
had
a
watch
set
upon
the
colonel
he
had
found
a
retired
policeman
a
most
discreet
man
as
he
was
assured
who
for
a
consideration
undertook
the
management
of
interesting
jobs
of
this
kind
the
man
was
one
bozzle
who
had
not
lived
without
a
certain
reputation
in
the
police
courts
in
these
days
of
his
madness
therefore
he
took
bozzle
into
his
pay
and
after
a
while
he
got
a
letter
from
bozzle
with
the
exeter
colonel
osborne
had
left
london
with
a
ticket
for
lessboro
bozzle
also
had
taken
a
place
by
the
same
train
for
that
small
town
the
letter
was
written
in
the
railway
carriage
and
as
bozzle
explained
would
be
posted
by
him
as
he
passed
through
exeter
a
further
communication
should
be
made
by
the
next
day
post
in
a
letter
which
bozzle
proposed
to
address
to
z
waterloo
place
on
receiving
this
first
letter
trevelyan
was
in
an
agony
of
doubt
as
well
as
misery
what
should
he
do
should
he
go
to
lady
milborough
or
to
stanbury
or
should
he
at
once
follow
colonel
osborne
and
bozzle
to
lessboro
it
ended
in
his
resolving
at
last
to
wait
for
the
letter
which
was
to
be
addressed
to
z
a
but
he
spent
an
interval
of
horrible
suspense
and
of
insane
rage
let
the
laws
say
what
they
might
he
would
have
the
man
blood
if
he
found
that
the
man
had
even
attempted
to
wrong
him
then
at
last
the
second
letter
reached
him
colonel
osborne
and
bozzle
had
each
of
them
spent
the
day
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lessboro
not
exactly
in
each
other
company
but
very
near
to
each
other
the
colonel
had
ordered
a
gig
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
lessboro
for
the
village
of
cockchaffington
and
for
all
bozzle
knew
the
colonel
had
gone
to
cockchaffington
bozzle
was
ultimately
inclined
to
think
that
the
colonel
had
really
spent
his
day
in
going
to
cockchaffington
bozzle
himself
knowing
the
wiles
of
such
men
as
colonel
osborne
and
thinking
at
first
that
that
journey
to
cockchaffington
might
only
be
a
deep
ruse
had
walked
over
to
nuncombe
putney
there
he
had
had
a
pint
of
beer
and
some
bread
and
cheese
at
crocket
house
and
had
asked
various
questions
to
which
he
did
not
receive
very
satisfactory
answers
but
he
inspected
the
clock
house
very
minutely
and
came
to
a
decided
opinion
as
to
the
point
at
which
it
would
be
attacked
if
burglary
were
the
object
of
the
assailants
and
he
observed
the
iron
gates
and
the
steps
and
the
shape
of
the
trees
and
the
old
fabric
in
which
the
clock
used
to
be
placed
there
was
no
knowing
when
information
might
be
wanted
or
what
information
might
not
be
of
use
but
he
made
himself
tolerably
sure
that
colonel
osborne
did
not
visit
nuncombe
putney
on
that
day
and
then
he
walked
back
to
lessboro
having
done
this
he
applied
himself
to
the
little
memorandum
book
in
which
he
kept
the
records
of
these
interesting
duties
and
entered
a
claim
against
his
employer
for
a
conveyance
to
nuncombe
putney
and
back
including
driver
and
ostler
and
then
he
wrote
his
letter
after
that
he
had
a
hot
supper
with
three
glasses
of
brandy
and
water
and
went
to
bed
with
a
thorough
conviction
that
he
had
earned
his
bread
on
that
day
the
letter
to
z
did
not
give
all
these
particulars
but
it
did
explain
that
colonel
osborne
had
gone
off
apparently
to
cockchaffington
and
that
he
bozzle
had
himself
visited
nuncombe
putney
the
hawk
has
been
nigh
the
dovecot
as
yet
said
bozzle
in
his
letter
meaning
to
be
both
mysterious
and
facetious
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
the
wit
or
the
mystery
disgusted
trevelyan
the
most
he
had
felt
that
he
was
defiling
himself
with
dirt
when
he
first
went
to
bozzle
he
knew
that
he
was
having
recourse
to
means
that
were
base
and
low
which
could
not
be
other
than
base
or
low
let
the
circumstances
be
what
they
might
but
bozzle
conversation
had
not
been
quite
so
bad
as
letters
as
it
may
have
been
that
bozzle
successful
activity
was
more
insupportable
than
his
futile
attempts
but
nevertheless
something
must
be
done
it
could
not
be
that
colonel
osborne
should
have
gone
down
to
the
close
neighbourhood
of
nuncombe
putney
without
the
intention
of
seeing
the
lady
whom
his
obtrusive
pertinacity
had
driven
to
that
seclusion
it
was
terrible
to
trevelyan
that
colonel
osborne
should
be
there
and
not
the
less
terrible
because
such
a
one
as
bozzle
was
watching
the
colonel
on
his
behalf
should
he
go
to
nuncombe
putney
himself
and
if
so
when
he
got
to
nuncombe
putney
what
should
he
do
there
at
last
in
his
suspense
and
his
grief
he
resolved
that
he
would
tell
the
whole
to
hugh
stanbury
do
you
mean
said
hugh
that
you
have
put
a
policeman
on
his
track
the
man
was
a
policeman
once
what
we
call
a
private
detective
i
ca
say
i
think
you
were
right
but
you
see
that
it
was
necessary
said
trevelyan
i
ca
say
that
it
was
necessary
to
speak
out
i
ca
understand
that
a
wife
should
be
worth
watching
who
requires
watching
is
a
man
to
do
nothing
then
and
even
now
it
is
not
my
wife
whom
i
doubt
as
for
colonel
osborne
if
he
chooses
to
go
to
lessboro
why
should
he
nothing
that
you
can
do
or
that
bozzle
can
do
can
prevent
him
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
go
to
lessboro
but
he
has
not
a
right
to
go
to
my
wife
and
if
your
wife
refuses
to
see
him
or
having
seen
him
for
a
man
may
force
his
way
in
anywhere
with
a
little
trouble
if
she
sends
him
away
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
as
i
believe
she
would
she
is
so
frightfully
indiscreet
i
do
see
what
bozzle
can
do
he
has
found
out
at
any
rate
that
osborne
is
there
said
trevelyan
i
am
not
more
fond
of
dealing
with
such
fellows
than
you
are
yourself
but
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
know
what
is
going
on
what
ought
i
to
do
now
i
should
do
nothing
except
dismiss
bozzle
you
know
that
that
is
nonsense
stanbury
whatever
i
did
i
should
dismiss
bozzle
stanbury
was
now
quite
in
earnest
and
as
he
repeated
his
suggestion
for
the
dismissal
of
the
policeman
pushed
his
writing
things
away
from
him
if
you
ask
my
opinion
you
know
i
must
tell
you
what
i
think
i
should
get
rid
of
bozzle
as
a
beginning
if
you
will
only
think
of
it
how
can
your
wife
come
back
to
you
if
she
learns
that
you
have
set
a
detective
to
watch
her
but
i
have
set
the
man
to
watch
her
colonel
osborne
is
nothing
to
you
except
as
he
is
concerned
with
her
this
man
is
now
down
in
her
neighbourhood
and
if
she
learns
that
how
can
she
help
feeling
it
as
a
deep
insult
of
course
the
man
watches
her
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
but
what
am
i
to
do
i
ca
write
to
the
man
and
tell
him
to
come
away
osborne
is
down
there
and
i
must
do
something
will
you
go
down
to
nuncombe
putney
yourself
and
let
me
know
the
truth
after
much
debating
of
the
subject
hugh
stanbury
said
that
he
would
himself
go
down
to
nuncombe
putney
alone
there
were
difficulties
about
the
but
he
would
go
to
the
office
of
the
newspaper
and
overcome
them
how
far
the
presence
of
nora
rowley
at
his
house
may
have
assisted
in
bringing
him
to
undertake
the
journey
perhaps
need
not
be
accurately
stated
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
the
claims
of
friendship
were
strong
upon
him
and
that
as
he
had
loudly
disapproved
of
the
bozzle
arrangement
he
ought
to
lend
a
hand
to
some
other
scheme
of
action
moreover
having
professed
his
conviction
that
no
improper
visiting
could
possibly
take
place
under
his
mother
roof
he
felt
bound
to
shew
that
he
was
not
afraid
to
trust
to
that
conviction
himself
he
declared
that
he
would
be
ready
to
proceed
to
nuncombe
putney
but
only
on
condition
that
he
might
have
plenary
power
to
dismiss
bozzle
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
take
any
notice
of
the
man
said
trevelyan
how
can
i
help
noticing
him
when
i
find
him
prowling
about
the
place
of
course
i
shall
know
who
he
is
i
do
see
that
you
need
know
anything
about
him
my
dear
trevelyan
you
can
not
have
two
ambassadors
engaged
in
the
same
service
without
communication
with
each
other
and
any
communication
with
bozzle
except
that
of
sending
him
back
to
london
i
will
not
have
the
controversy
was
ended
by
the
writing
of
a
letter
from
trevelyan
to
bozzle
which
was
confided
to
stanbury
in
which
the
was
thanked
for
his
activity
and
requested
to
return
to
london
for
the
present
as
we
are
now
aware
that
colonel
osborne
is
in
the
neighbourhood
said
the
letter
my
friend
stanbury
will
know
what
to
do
as
soon
as
this
was
settled
stanbury
went
to
the
office
of
the
and
made
arrangement
as
to
his
work
for
three
days
jones
could
do
the
article
on
the
irish
church
upon
a
pinch
like
this
although
he
had
not
given
much
study
to
the
subject
as
yet
and
puddlethwaite
who
was
great
in
city
matters
would
try
his
hand
on
the
present
state
of
society
in
rome
a
subject
on
which
it
was
essential
that
the
should
express
itself
at
once
having
settled
these
little
troubles
stanbury
returned
to
his
friend
and
in
the
evening
they
dined
together
at
a
tavern
and
now
trevelyan
let
me
know
fairly
what
it
is
that
you
wish
said
stanbury
i
wish
to
have
my
wife
back
again
simply
that
if
she
will
agree
to
come
back
you
will
make
no
difficulty
no
not
quite
simply
that
i
shall
desire
that
she
shall
be
guided
by
my
wishes
as
to
any
intimacies
she
may
form
that
is
all
very
well
but
is
she
to
give
any
undertaking
do
you
intend
to
exact
any
promise
from
her
it
is
my
opinion
that
she
will
be
willing
enough
to
come
back
and
that
when
she
is
with
you
there
will
be
no
further
cause
for
quarrelling
but
i
do
think
she
will
bind
herself
by
any
exacted
promise
and
certainly
not
through
a
third
person
then
say
nothing
about
it
let
her
write
a
letter
to
me
proposing
to
come
and
she
shall
come
very
well
so
far
i
understand
and
now
what
about
colonel
osborne
you
do
want
me
to
quarrel
with
him
i
suppose
i
should
like
to
keep
that
for
myself
said
trevelyan
grimly
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
not
trouble
yourself
about
him
said
stanbury
but
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
not
to
meddle
or
make
with
him
of
course
continued
stanbury
after
a
pause
if
i
find
that
he
is
intruding
himself
in
my
mother
house
i
shall
tell
him
that
he
must
not
come
there
but
if
you
find
him
installed
in
your
mother
house
as
a
visitor
how
then
i
do
not
regard
that
as
possible
i
do
mean
living
there
said
trevelyan
but
coming
backwards
and
forwards
going
on
in
habits
of
intimacy
with
with
his
voice
trembled
so
as
he
asked
these
questions
that
he
could
not
pronounce
the
word
which
was
to
complete
them
with
trevelyan
you
mean
yes
with
my
wife
i
do
say
that
it
is
so
but
it
may
be
so
you
will
be
bound
to
tell
me
the
truth
i
will
certainly
tell
you
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
yes
the
whole
truth
should
it
be
so
i
will
never
see
her
again
never
and
as
for
him
but
never
mind
then
there
was
another
short
period
of
silence
during
which
stanbury
smoked
his
pipe
and
sipped
his
whisky
toddy
you
must
see
continued
trevelyan
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
do
something
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
that
you
do
not
like
detectives
neither
do
i
like
them
but
what
was
i
to
do
when
you
condemn
me
you
hardly
realise
the
difficulties
of
my
position
it
is
the
deuce
of
a
nuisance
certainly
said
stanbury
through
the
cloud
of
smoke
thinking
now
not
at
all
of
trevelyan
but
of
trevelyan
sister
it
makes
a
man
almost
feel
that
he
had
better
not
marry
at
all
said
trevelyan
i
do
see
that
of
course
there
may
come
troubles
the
tiles
may
fall
on
your
head
you
know
as
you
walk
through
the
streets
as
far
as
i
can
see
women
go
straight
enough
nineteen
times
out
of
twenty
but
they
do
like
being
what
i
call
looked
after
and
did
i
look
after
my
wife
more
than
i
ought
i
do
mean
that
but
if
i
were
married
which
i
never
shall
be
for
i
shall
never
attain
to
the
respectability
of
a
fixed
income
i
fancy
i
should
look
after
my
wife
at
all
it
seems
to
me
that
women
hate
to
be
told
about
their
duties
but
if
you
saw
your
wife
quite
innocently
falling
into
an
improper
intimacy
taking
up
with
people
she
ought
not
to
know
doing
that
in
ignorance
which
could
not
but
compromise
yourself
would
you
speak
a
word
then
oh
i
might
just
say
in
an
way
that
jones
was
a
rascal
or
a
liar
or
a
fool
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
i
would
never
caution
her
against
jones
by
george
i
believe
a
woman
can
stand
anything
better
than
that
you
have
never
tried
it
my
friend
and
i
do
suppose
i
ever
shall
as
for
me
i
believe
aunt
stanbury
was
right
when
she
said
that
i
was
a
radical
vagabond
i
dare
say
i
shall
never
try
the
thing
myself
and
therefore
it
very
easy
to
have
a
theory
but
i
must
be
off
good
night
old
fellow
i
do
the
best
i
can
and
at
any
rate
i
let
you
know
the
truth
there
had
been
a
question
during
the
day
as
to
whether
stanbury
should
let
his
sister
know
by
letter
that
he
was
expected
but
it
had
been
decided
that
he
should
appear
at
nuncombe
without
any
previous
notification
of
his
arrival
trevelyan
had
thought
that
this
was
very
necessary
and
when
stanbury
had
urged
that
such
a
measure
seemed
to
imply
suspicion
he
had
declared
that
in
no
other
way
could
the
truth
be
obtained
he
trevelyan
simply
wanted
to
know
the
facts
as
they
were
occurring
it
was
a
fact
that
colonel
osborne
was
down
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nuncombe
putney
that
at
least
had
been
ascertained
it
might
very
possibly
be
the
case
that
he
would
be
refused
admittance
to
the
clock
house
that
all
the
ladies
there
would
combine
to
keep
him
out
but
so
trevelyan
urged
the
truth
on
this
point
was
desired
it
was
essentially
necessary
to
his
happiness
that
he
should
know
what
was
being
done
your
mother
and
sister
said
he
can
not
be
afraid
of
your
coming
suddenly
among
them
stanbury
so
urged
had
found
it
necessary
to
yield
but
yet
he
had
felt
that
he
himself
was
almost
acting
like
a
detective
policeman
in
purposely
falling
down
upon
them
without
a
word
of
announcement
had
chance
circumstances
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
go
in
such
a
manner
he
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
it
would
simply
have
been
a
pleasant
joke
to
him
as
he
went
down
by
the
train
on
the
following
day
he
almost
felt
ashamed
of
the
part
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
perform
chapter
xx
shewing
how
colonel
osborne
went
to
cockchaffington
together
with
miss
stanbury
first
letter
to
her
a
letter
had
also
been
delivered
to
trevelyan
nora
rowley
as
her
sister
had
left
the
room
with
this
in
her
hand
had
expressed
her
opinion
that
it
had
come
from
trevelyan
but
it
had
in
truth
been
written
by
colonel
osborne
and
when
that
second
letter
from
miss
stanbury
had
been
received
at
the
clock
house
that
in
which
she
in
plain
terms
begged
pardon
for
the
accusation
conveyed
in
her
first
letter
colonel
osborne
had
started
on
his
deceitful
little
journey
to
cockchaffington
and
bozzle
the
who
had
him
in
hand
had
already
asked
his
way
to
nuncombe
putney
when
colonel
osborne
learned
that
louis
trevelyan
had
broken
up
his
establishment
in
curzon
street
and
had
sent
his
wife
away
into
a
barbarous
retirement
in
dartmoor
for
such
was
the
nature
of
the
information
on
the
subject
which
was
spread
among
trevelyan
friends
in
london
and
when
he
was
made
aware
also
that
all
this
was
done
on
his
account
because
he
was
so
closely
intimate
with
wife
and
because
trevelyan
wife
was
and
persisted
in
continuing
to
be
so
closely
intimate
with
him
his
vanity
was
gratified
although
it
might
be
true
and
no
doubt
was
true
that
he
said
much
to
his
friends
and
to
himself
of
the
deep
sorrow
which
he
felt
that
such
a
trouble
should
befall
his
old
friend
and
his
old
daughter
nevertheless
as
he
curled
his
grey
whiskers
before
the
glass
and
made
the
most
of
such
remnant
of
hair
as
was
left
on
the
top
of
his
head
as
he
looked
to
the
padding
of
his
coat
and
completed
a
study
of
the
wrinkles
beneath
his
eyes
so
that
in
conversation
they
might
be
as
little
apparent
as
possible
he
felt
more
of
pleasure
than
of
pain
in
regard
to
the
whole
affair
it
was
very
sad
that
it
should
be
so
but
it
was
human
had
it
been
in
his
power
to
set
the
whole
matter
right
by
a
word
he
would
probably
have
spoken
that
word
but
as
this
was
not
possible
as
trevelyan
had
in
his
opinion
made
a
gross
fool
of
himself
as
emily
trevelyan
was
very
nice
and
not
the
less
nice
in
that
she
certainly
was
fond
of
himself
as
great
tyranny
had
been
used
towards
her
and
as
he
himself
had
still
the
plea
of
old
family
friendship
to
protect
his
conscience
to
protect
his
conscience
unless
he
went
so
far
as
to
make
that
plea
an
additional
sting
to
his
conscience
he
thought
that
as
a
man
he
must
follow
up
the
matter
here
was
a
young
and
fashionable
and
very
pretty
woman
banished
to
the
wilds
of
dartmoor
for
his
sake
and
as
far
as
he
could
understand
she
would
not
have
been
so
banished
had
she
consented
to
say
that
she
would
give
up
her
acquaintance
with
him
in
such
circumstances
as
these
was
it
possible
that
he
should
do
nothing
various
ideas
ran
through
his
head
he
began
to
think
that
if
trevelyan
were
out
of
the
way
he
might
might
perhaps
be
almost
tempted
to
make
this
woman
his
wife
she
was
so
nice
that
he
almost
thought
that
he
might
be
rash
enough
for
that
although
he
knew
well
the
satisfaction
of
being
a
bachelor
but
as
the
thought
suggested
itself
to
him
he
was
well
aware
that
he
was
thinking
of
a
thing
quite
distant
from
him
the
reader
is
not
to
suppose
that
colonel
osborne
meditated
any
with
the
husband
our
colonel
was
certainly
not
the
man
for
a
murder
nor
did
he
even
think
of
running
away
with
his
friend
daughter
though
he
told
himself
that
he
could
dispose
of
his
wrinkles
satisfactorily
still
he
knew
himself
and
his
powers
sufficiently
to
be
aware
that
he
was
no
longer
fit
to
be
the
hero
of
such
a
romance
as
that
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
there
was
much
labour
to
be
gone
through
in
running
away
with
another
man
wife
and
that
the
results
in
respect
to
personal
comfort
are
not
always
happy
but
what
if
trevelyan
were
to
divorce
herself
from
her
husband
on
the
score
of
her
husband
cruelty
various
horrors
were
related
as
to
the
treatment
of
his
wife
by
some
it
was
said
that
she
was
in
the
prison
on
dartmoor
or
if
not
actually
in
the
prison
an
arrangement
which
the
prison
discipline
might
perhaps
make
difficult
that
she
was
in
the
custody
of
one
of
the
prison
warders
who
possessed
a
prim
cottage
and
a
grim
wife
just
outside
the
prison
walls
colonel
osborne
did
not
himself
believe
even
so
much
as
this
but
he
did
believe
that
trevelyan
had
been
banished
to
some
inhospitable
region
to
some
dreary
comfortless
abode
of
which
as
the
wife
of
a
man
of
fortune
she
would
have
great
ground
to
complain
so
thinking
he
did
not
probably
declare
to
himself
that
a
divorce
should
be
obtained
and
that
in
such
event
he
would
marry
the
lady
but
ideas
came
across
his
mind
in
that
direction
trevelyan
was
a
cruel
bluebeard
emily
as
he
was
studious
to
call
trevelyan
was
a
dear
injured
saint
and
as
for
himself
though
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
the
lumbago
pinched
him
now
and
again
so
that
he
could
not
rise
from
his
chair
with
all
the
alacrity
of
youth
yet
when
he
walked
along
pall
mall
with
his
coat
properly
buttoned
he
could
not
but
observe
that
a
great
many
young
women
looked
at
him
with
admiring
eyes
it
was
thus
with
no
settled
scheme
that
the
colonel
went
to
work
and
made
inquiries
and
ascertained
trevelyan
address
in
devonshire
when
he
learned
it
he
thought
that
he
had
done
much
though
in
truth
there
had
been
no
secrecy
in
the
matter
scores
of
people
knew
trevelyan
address
besides
the
newsvendor
who
supplied
her
paper
from
whose
boy
colonel
osborne
servant
obtained
the
information
but
when
the
information
had
been
obtained
it
was
expedient
that
it
should
be
used
and
therefore
colonel
osborne
wrote
the
following
letter
acrobats
club
july
dear
emily
twice
the
colonel
wrote
dearest
emily
and
twice
he
tore
the
sheet
on
which
the
words
were
written
he
longed
to
be
ardent
but
still
it
was
so
necessary
to
be
prudent
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
the
lady
women
sometimes
tell
their
husbands
even
when
they
have
quarrelled
with
them
and
although
ardent
expressions
in
writing
to
pretty
women
are
pleasant
to
male
writers
it
is
not
pleasant
for
a
gentleman
to
be
asked
what
on
earth
he
means
by
that
sort
of
thing
at
his
time
of
life
the
colonel
gave
half
an
hour
to
the
consideration
and
then
began
the
letter
dear
emily
if
prudence
be
the
soul
of
valour
may
it
not
be
considered
also
the
very
mainspring
or
perhaps
the
pivot
of
love
dear
emily
i
need
hardly
tell
you
with
what
dismay
i
have
heard
of
all
that
has
taken
place
in
curzon
street
i
fear
that
you
must
have
suffered
much
and
that
you
are
suffering
now
it
is
an
inexpressible
relief
to
me
to
hear
that
you
have
your
child
with
you
and
nora
but
nevertheless
to
have
your
home
taken
away
from
you
to
be
sent
out
of
london
to
be
banished
from
all
society
and
for
what
the
manner
in
which
the
minds
of
some
men
work
is
quite
incomprehensible
as
for
myself
i
feel
that
i
have
lost
the
company
of
a
friend
whom
indeed
i
can
very
ill
spare
i
have
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
you
and
among
them
one
or
two
which
i
feel
that
i
must
say
that
i
ought
to
say
as
it
happens
an
old
schoolfellow
of
mine
is
vicar
of
cockchaffington
a
village
which
i
find
by
the
map
is
very
near
to
nuncombe
putney
i
saw
him
in
town
last
spring
and
he
then
asked
me
to
pay
him
a
visit
there
is
something
in
his
church
which
people
go
to
see
and
though
i
do
understand
churches
much
i
shall
go
and
see
it
i
shall
run
down
on
wednesday
and
shall
sleep
at
the
inn
at
lessboro
i
see
that
lessboro
is
a
market
town
and
i
suppose
there
is
an
inn
i
shall
go
over
to
my
friend
on
the
thursday
but
shall
return
to
lessboro
though
a
man
be
ever
so
eager
to
see
a
church
he
need
not
sleep
at
the
parsonage
on
the
following
day
i
will
get
over
to
nuncombe
putney
and
i
hope
that
you
will
see
me
considering
my
long
friendship
with
you
and
my
great
attachment
to
your
father
and
mother
i
do
not
think
that
the
strictest
martinet
would
tell
you
that
you
need
hesitate
in
the
matter
i
have
seen
trevelyan
twice
at
the
club
but
he
has
not
spoken
to
me
under
such
circumstances
i
could
not
of
course
speak
to
him
indeed
i
may
say
that
my
feelings
towards
him
just
at
present
are
of
such
a
nature
as
to
preclude
me
from
doing
so
with
any
appearance
of
cordiality
dear
emily
believe
me
now
as
always
your
affectionate
friend
frederic
osborne
when
he
read
that
letter
over
to
himself
a
second
time
he
felt
quite
sure
that
he
had
not
committed
himself
even
if
his
friend
were
to
send
the
letter
to
her
husband
it
could
not
do
him
any
harm
he
was
aware
that
he
might
have
dilated
more
on
the
old
friendship
between
himself
and
sir
marmaduke
but
he
experienced
a
certain
distaste
to
the
mention
of
things
appertaining
to
years
long
past
it
did
not
quite
suit
him
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
to
speak
of
his
regard
in
those
terms
which
he
would
have
used
had
it
satisfied
him
to
represent
himself
simply
as
her
father
friend
his
language
therefore
had
been
a
little
doubtful
so
that
the
lady
might
if
she
were
so
minded
look
upon
him
in
that
tender
light
in
which
her
husband
had
certainly
chosen
to
regard
him
when
the
letter
was
handed
to
trevelyan
she
at
once
took
it
with
her
up
to
her
own
room
so
that
she
might
be
alone
when
she
read
it
the
handwriting
was
quite
familiar
to
her
and
she
did
not
choose
that
even
her
sister
should
see
it
she
had
told
herself
twenty
times
over
that
while
living
at
nuncombe
putney
she
was
not
living
under
the
guardianship
of
stanbury
she
would
consent
to
live
under
the
guardianship
of
no
one
as
her
husband
did
not
choose
to
remain
with
her
and
protect
her
she
had
done
no
wrong
and
she
would
submit
to
no
other
authority
than
that
of
her
legal
lord
and
master
nor
according
to
her
views
of
her
own
position
was
it
in
his
power
to
depute
that
authority
to
others
he
had
caused
the
separation
and
now
she
must
be
the
sole
judge
of
her
own
actions
in
itself
a
correspondence
between
her
and
her
father
old
friend
was
in
no
degree
criminal
or
even
faulty
there
was
no
reason
moral
social
or
religious
why
an
old
man
over
fifty
who
had
known
her
all
her
life
should
not
write
to
her
but
yet
she
could
not
say
aloud
before
stanbury
and
priscilla
and
her
sister
that
she
had
received
a
letter
from
colonel
osborne
she
felt
that
the
colour
had
come
to
her
cheek
and
that
she
could
not
even
walk
out
of
the
room
as
though
the
letter
had
been
a
matter
of
indifference
to
her
and
would
it
have
been
a
matter
of
indifference
had
there
been
nobody
there
to
see
her
trevelyan
was
certainly
not
in
love
with
colonel
osborne
she
was
not
more
so
now
than
she
had
been
when
her
father
friend
purposely
dressed
for
the
occasion
had
kissed
her
in
the
vestry
of
the
church
in
which
she
was
married
and
had
given
her
a
blessing
which
was
then
intended
to
be
as
from
an
old
man
to
a
young
woman
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
never
would
be
never
could
be
in
love
with
him
reader
you
may
believe
in
her
so
far
as
that
but
where
is
the
woman
who
when
she
is
neglected
thrown
over
and
suspected
by
the
man
that
she
loves
will
not
feel
the
desire
of
some
sympathy
some
solicitude
some
show
of
regard
from
another
man
this
woman
life
too
had
not
hitherto
been
of
such
a
nature
that
the
tranquillity
of
the
clock
house
at
nuncombe
putney
afforded
to
her
all
that
she
desired
she
had
been
there
now
a
month
and
was
almost
sick
from
the
want
of
excitement
and
she
was
full
of
wrath
against
her
husband
why
had
he
sent
her
there
to
break
her
heart
in
a
disgraceful
retirement
when
she
had
never
wronged
him
from
morning
to
night
she
had
no
employment
no
amusement
nothing
to
satisfy
her
cravings
why
was
she
to
be
doomed
to
such
an
existence
she
had
declared
that
as
long
as
she
could
have
her
boy
with
her
she
would
be
happy
she
was
allowed
to
have
her
boy
but
she
was
anything
but
happy
when
she
received
colonel
osborne
letter
while
she
held
it
in
her
hand
still
unopened
she
never
for
a
moment
thought
that
that
could
make
her
happy
but
there
was
in
it
something
of
excitement
and
she
painted
the
man
to
herself
in
brighter
colours
now
than
she
had
ever
given
to
him
in
her
former
portraits
he
cared
for
her
he
was
gracious
to
her
he
appreciated
her
talents
her
beauty
and
her
conduct
he
knew
that
she
deserved
a
treatment
very
different
from
that
accorded
to
her
by
her
husband
why
should
she
reject
the
sympathy
of
her
father
oldest
friend
because
her
husband
was
madly
jealous
about
an
old
man
her
husband
had
chosen
to
send
her
away
and
to
leave
her
so
that
she
must
act
on
her
own
judgment
acting
on
her
own
judgment
she
read
colonel
osborne
letter
from
first
to
last
she
knew
that
he
was
wrong
to
speak
of
coming
to
nuncombe
putney
but
yet
she
thought
that
she
would
see
him
she
had
a
dim
perception
that
she
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
on
broken
ground
which
might
fall
under
her
without
a
moment
warning
and
yet
she
would
not
retreat
from
the
danger
though
colonel
osborne
was
wrong
very
wrong
in
coming
to
see
her
yet
she
liked
him
for
coming
though
she
would
be
half
afraid
to
tell
her
news
to
stanbury
and
more
than
half
afraid
to
tell
priscilla
yet
she
liked
the
excitement
of
the
fear
nora
would
scold
her
but
nora
scolding
she
thought
she
could
answer
and
then
it
was
not
the
fact
that
colonel
osborne
was
coming
down
to
devonshire
to
see
her
he
was
coming
as
far
as
lessboro
to
see
his
friend
at
cockchaffington
and
when
at
lessboro
was
it
likely
that
he
should
leave
the
neighbourhood
without
seeing
the
daughter
of
his
old
ally
and
why
should
he
do
so
was
he
to
be
unnatural
in
his
conduct
uncivil
and
unfriendly
because
trevelyan
had
been
foolish
suspicious
and
insane
so
arguing
with
herself
she
answered
colonel
osborne
letter
before
she
had
spoken
on
the
subject
to
any
one
in
the
house
and
this
was
her
answer
my
dear
colonel
osborne
i
must
leave
it
to
your
own
judgment
to
decide
whether
you
will
come
to
nuncombe
putney
or
not
there
are
reasons
which
would
seem
to
make
it
expedient
that
you
should
stay
away
even
though
circumstances
are
bringing
you
into
the
immediate
neighbourhood
but
of
these
reasons
i
will
leave
you
to
be
the
judge
i
will
never
let
it
be
said
that
i
myself
have
had
cause
to
dread
the
visit
of
any
old
friend
nevertheless
if
you
stay
away
i
shall
understand
why
you
do
so
personally
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
as
i
have
always
been
it
seems
odd
to
me
that
i
can
not
write
in
warmer
tones
to
my
father
and
mother
oldest
friend
of
course
you
will
understand
that
though
i
shall
readily
see
you
if
you
call
i
can
not
ask
you
to
stay
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
now
living
in
my
own
house
i
am
staying
with
stanbury
and
the
place
is
called
the
clock
house
yours
very
sincerely
emily
trevelyan
the
clock
house
nuncombe
putney
monday
soon
after
she
had
written
it
nora
came
into
her
room
and
at
once
asked
concerning
the
letter
which
she
had
seen
delivered
to
her
sister
that
morning
it
was
from
colonel
osborne
said
trevelyan
from
colonel
osborne
how
very
wrong
i
do
see
that
it
is
wrong
at
all
because
louis
is
foolish
and
mad
that
can
not
make
another
man
wrong
for
doing
the
most
ordinary
thing
in
the
world
i
had
hoped
it
had
been
from
louis
said
nora
oh
dear
no
he
is
by
no
means
so
considerate
i
do
not
suppose
i
shall
hear
from
him
till
he
chooses
to
give
some
fresh
order
about
myself
or
my
child
he
will
hardly
trouble
himself
to
write
to
me
unless
he
takes
up
some
new
freak
to
show
me
that
he
is
my
master
and
what
does
colonel
osborne
say
he
is
coming
here
coming
here
almost
shouted
nora
yes
absolutely
here
does
it
sound
to
you
as
if
lucifer
himself
were
about
to
show
his
face
the
fact
is
he
happens
to
have
a
friend
in
the
neighbourhood
whom
he
has
long
promised
to
visit
and
as
he
must
be
at
lessboro
he
does
not
choose
to
go
away
without
the
compliment
of
a
call
it
will
be
as
much
to
you
as
to
me
i
do
want
to
see
him
in
the
least
said
nora
there
is
his
letter
as
you
seem
to
be
so
suspicious
you
had
better
read
it
then
nora
read
it
and
there
is
a
copy
of
my
answer
said
trevelyan
i
shall
keep
both
because
i
know
so
well
what
things
people
will
say
dear
emily
do
not
send
it
said
nora
indeed
i
shall
i
will
not
be
frightened
by
bugbears
and
i
will
not
be
driven
to
confess
to
any
man
on
earth
that
i
am
afraid
to
see
him
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
colonel
osborne
i
will
not
submit
to
acknowledge
that
there
can
be
any
danger
in
colonel
osborne
were
i
to
do
so
i
should
be
repeating
the
insult
against
myself
if
my
husband
wished
to
guide
me
in
such
matters
why
did
he
not
stay
with
me
then
she
went
out
into
the
village
and
posted
the
letter
nora
meanwhile
was
thinking
whether
she
would
call
in
the
assistance
of
priscilla
stanbury
but
she
did
not
like
to
take
any
such
a
step
in
opposition
to
her
sister
chapter
xxi
shewing
how
colonel
osborne
went
to
nuncombe
putney
colonel
osborne
was
expected
at
nuncombe
putney
on
the
friday
and
it
was
thursday
evening
before
either
stanbury
or
priscilla
was
told
of
his
coming
emily
had
argued
the
matter
with
nora
declaring
that
she
would
make
the
communication
herself
and
that
she
would
make
it
when
she
pleased
and
how
she
pleased
if
stanbury
thinks
said
she
that
i
am
going
to
be
treated
as
a
prisoner
or
that
i
will
not
judge
myself
as
to
whom
i
may
see
or
whom
i
may
not
see
she
is
very
much
mistaken
nora
felt
that
were
she
to
give
information
to
those
ladies
in
opposition
to
her
sister
wishes
she
would
express
suspicion
on
her
own
part
by
doing
so
and
she
was
silent
on
that
same
thursday
priscilla
had
written
her
last
defiant
letter
to
her
aunt
that
letter
in
which
she
had
cautioned
her
aunt
to
make
no
further
accusations
without
being
sure
of
her
facts
to
priscilla
imagination
that
coming
of
lucifer
in
person
of
which
trevelyan
had
spoken
would
hardly
have
been
worse
than
the
coming
of
colonel
osborne
when
therefore
trevelyan
declared
the
fact
on
the
thursday
evening
vainly
endeavouring
to
speak
of
the
threatened
visit
in
an
ordinary
voice
and
as
of
an
ordinary
circumstance
it
was
as
though
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
upon
them
colonel
osborne
coming
here
said
priscilla
mindful
of
the
stanbury
correspondence
mindful
of
the
evil
tongues
of
the
world
and
why
not
demanded
trevelyan
who
had
heard
nothing
of
the
stanbury
correspondence
oh
dear
oh
dear
ejaculated
stanbury
who
of
course
was
aware
of
all
that
had
passed
between
the
clock
house
and
the
house
in
the
close
though
the
letters
had
been
written
by
her
daughter
nora
was
determined
to
stand
up
for
her
sister
whatever
might
be
the
circumstances
of
the
case
i
wish
colonel
osborne
were
not
coming
said
she
because
it
makes
a
foolish
fuss
but
i
can
not
understand
how
anybody
can
suppose
it
to
be
wrong
that
emily
should
see
very
oldest
friend
in
the
world
but
why
is
he
coming
demanded
priscilla
because
he
wants
to
see
an
acquaintance
at
cockchaffington
said
trevelyan
and
there
is
a
wonderful
there
a
said
priscilla
the
matter
was
debated
throughout
all
the
evening
at
one
time
there
was
a
great
quarrel
between
the
ladies
and
then
there
was
a
reconciliation
the
point
on
which
trevelyan
stood
with
the
greatest
firmness
was
this
that
it
did
not
become
her
as
a
married
woman
whose
conduct
had
always
been
good
and
who
was
more
careful
as
to
that
than
she
was
even
of
her
name
to
be
ashamed
to
meet
any
man
why
should
i
not
see
colonel
osborne
or
colonel
anybody
else
who
might
call
here
with
the
same
justification
for
calling
which
his
old
friendship
gives
him
priscilla
endeavoured
to
explain
to
her
that
her
husband
known
wishes
ought
to
hinder
her
from
doing
so
my
husband
should
have
remained
with
me
to
express
his
wishes
trevelyan
replied
neither
could
stanbury
nor
could
priscilla
bring
herself
to
say
that
the
man
should
not
be
admitted
into
the
house
in
the
course
of
the
debate
in
the
heat
of
her
anger
trevelyan
declared
that
were
any
such
threat
held
out
to
her
she
would
leave
the
house
and
see
colonel
osborne
in
the
street
or
at
the
inn
no
emily
no
said
nora
but
i
will
i
will
not
submit
to
be
treated
as
a
guilty
woman
or
as
a
prisoner
they
may
say
what
they
like
but
i
wo
be
shut
up
no
one
has
tried
to
shut
you
up
said
priscilla
you
are
afraid
of
that
old
woman
at
exeter
said
trevelyan
for
by
this
time
the
facts
of
the
stanbury
correspondence
had
all
been
elicited
in
general
conversation
and
yet
you
know
how
uncharitable
and
malicious
she
is
we
are
not
afraid
of
her
said
priscilla
we
are
afraid
of
nothing
but
of
doing
wrong
and
will
it
be
wrong
to
let
an
old
gentleman
come
into
the
house
said
nora
who
is
nearly
sixty
and
who
has
known
us
ever
since
we
were
born
if
he
is
nearly
sixty
priscilla
said
stanbury
that
does
seem
to
make
a
difference
stanbury
herself
was
only
just
sixty
and
she
felt
herself
to
be
quite
an
old
woman
they
may
be
devils
at
eighty
said
priscilla
colonel
osborne
is
not
a
devil
at
all
said
nora
but
mamma
is
so
foolish
said
priscilla
the
man
age
does
not
matter
in
the
least
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
said
stanbury
very
humbly
at
that
time
the
quarrel
was
raging
but
afterwards
came
the
reconciliation
had
it
not
been
for
the
stanbury
correspondence
the
fact
of
colonel
osborne
threatened
visit
would
have
been
admitted
as
a
thing
necessary
as
a
disagreeable
necessity
but
how
was
the
visit
to
be
admitted
and
passed
over
in
the
teeth
of
that
correspondence
priscilla
felt
very
keenly
the
peculiar
cruelty
of
her
position
of
course
aunt
stanbury
would
hear
of
the
visit
indeed
any
secrecy
in
the
matter
was
not
compatible
with
ideas
of
honesty
her
aunt
had
apologised
humbly
for
having
said
that
colonel
osborne
had
been
at
nuncombe
that
apology
doubtless
had
been
due
colonel
osborne
had
not
been
at
nuncombe
when
the
accusation
had
been
made
and
the
accusation
had
been
unjust
and
false
but
his
coming
had
been
spoken
of
by
priscilla
in
her
own
letters
as
an
occurrence
which
was
quite
out
of
the
question
her
anger
against
her
aunt
had
been
for
saying
that
the
man
had
come
not
for
objecting
to
such
a
visit
and
now
the
man
was
coming
and
aunt
stanbury
would
know
all
about
it
how
great
how
terrible
how
crushing
would
be
aunt
stanbury
triumph
i
must
write
and
tell
her
said
priscilla
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
object
said
trevelyan
and
hugh
must
be
told
said
stanbury
you
may
tell
all
the
world
if
you
like
said
trevelyan
in
this
way
it
was
settled
among
them
that
colonel
osborne
was
to
be
received
on
the
next
morning
friday
morning
colonel
osborne
doubtless
having
heard
something
of
crocket
from
his
friend
at
cockchaffington
was
up
early
and
had
himself
driven
over
to
nuncombe
putney
before
breakfast
the
bozzle
was
of
course
at
his
heels
or
rather
not
at
his
heels
on
the
first
two
miles
of
the
journey
for
bozzle
with
painful
zeal
had
made
himself
aware
of
all
the
facts
and
had
started
on
the
nuncombe
putney
road
half
an
hour
before
the
colonel
fly
was
in
motion
and
when
the
fly
passed
him
he
was
lying
discreetly
hidden
behind
an
old
oak
the
driver
however
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
was
topping
a
hill
and
having
seen
him
about
on
the
previous
day
and
perceiving
that
he
was
dressed
in
a
decent
coat
and
trousers
and
that
nevertheless
he
was
not
a
gentleman
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
somebody
there
was
a
great
deal
said
afterwards
about
bozzle
in
clegg
yard
at
lessboro
but
the
lessboro
mind
was
never
able
to
satisfy
itself
altogether
respecting
bozzle
and
his
mission
as
to
colonel
osborne
and
his
mission
the
lessboro
mind
did
satisfy
itself
with
much
certainty
the
horse
was
hardly
taken
from
out
of
colonel
osborne
fly
in
crocket
yard
when
bozzle
stepped
into
the
village
by
a
path
which
he
had
already
discovered
and
soon
busied
himself
among
the
tombs
in
the
churchyard
now
one
corner
of
the
churchyard
was
immediately
opposite
to
the
iron
gate
leading
into
the
clock
house
drat
said
the
postman
still
sitting
on
his
donkey
to
crocket
ostler
if
there
the
chap
as
was
here
yesterday
when
i
was
a
starting
and
i
zeed
in
lezbro
street
thick
very
morning
he
arter
no
good
that
said
the
ostler
after
that
a
close
watch
was
kept
upon
the
watcher
illustration
the
postman
of
nuncombe
putney
in
the
meantime
colonel
osborne
had
ordered
his
breakfast
at
the
stag
and
antlers
and
had
asked
questions
as
to
the
position
of
the
clock
house
he
was
altogether
ignorant
of
bozzle
although
bozzle
had
been
on
his
track
now
for
two
days
and
two
nights
he
had
determined
as
he
came
on
to
nuncombe
putney
that
he
would
not
be
about
his
visit
to
trevelyan
it
is
possible
that
he
was
not
so
keen
in
the
matter
as
he
had
been
when
he
planned
his
journey
in
london
and
it
may
be
that
he
really
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
had
come
all
the
way
to
the
confines
of
dartmoor
to
see
the
porch
of
cockchaffington
church
the
session
in
london
was
over
and
it
was
necessary
for
such
a
man
as
colonel
osborne
that
he
should
do
something
with
himself
before
he
went
down
to
the
scotch
grouse
he
had
long
desired
to
see
something
of
the
most
picturesque
county
in
england
and
now
as
he
sat
eating
his
breakfast
in
crocket
parlour
he
almost
looked
upon
his
dear
emily
as
a
subsidiary
attraction
oh
that
the
clock
house
he
said
to
crocket
no
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
stanbury
very
respectable
lady
so
i
have
heard
widow
of
a
clergyman
ah
yes
son
up
in
london
i
know
him
always
writing
books
is
he
very
clever
i
dare
say
but
there
a
lady
indeed
two
ladies
whom
i
do
know
trevelyan
is
there
i
think
and
miss
rowley
you
muster
trevelyan
be
you
said
crocket
looking
at
him
very
hard
no
i
not
mr
trevelyan
nor
yet
colonel
they
doo
be
talking
about
well
yes
i
am
a
colonel
i
do
know
why
anybody
should
talk
about
me
i
just
step
out
now
however
and
see
my
friends
it
madam
lover
said
crocket
to
herself
as
sure
as
eggs
is
eggs
as
she
said
so
colonel
osborne
boldly
walked
across
the
village
and
pulled
the
bell
at
the
iron
gate
while
bozzle
crouching
among
the
tombs
saw
the
handle
in
his
hand
there
he
is
said
priscilla
everybody
in
the
clock
house
had
known
that
the
fly
which
they
had
seen
had
brought
the
colonel
into
nuncombe
putney
everybody
had
known
that
he
had
breakfasted
at
the
stag
and
antlers
and
everybody
now
knew
that
he
was
at
the
gate
ringing
the
bell
into
the
said
stanbury
with
a
fearful
tremulous
whisper
to
the
girl
who
went
across
the
little
garden
in
front
to
open
the
iron
gate
the
girl
felt
as
though
apollyon
were
there
and
as
though
she
were
called
upon
to
admit
apollyon
stanbury
having
uttered
her
whisper
hurried
away
priscilla
held
her
ground
in
the
parlour
determined
to
be
near
the
scene
of
action
if
there
might
be
need
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
she
peeped
from
behind
the
curtain
anxious
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
terrible
man
whose
coming
to
nuncombe
putney
she
regarded
as
so
severe
a
misfortune
the
plan
of
the
campaign
had
all
been
arranged
trevelyan
and
nora
together
received
colonel
osborne
in
the
it
was
understood
that
nora
was
to
remain
there
during
the
whole
visit
it
is
horrible
to
think
that
such
a
precaution
should
be
necessary
trevelyan
had
said
but
perhaps
it
may
be
best
there
is
no
knowing
what
the
malice
of
people
may
not
invent
my
dear
girls
said
the
colonel
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
and
he
gave
a
hand
to
each
we
are
not
very
cheerful
here
said
trevelyan
as
you
may
imagine
but
the
scenery
is
beautiful
said
nora
and
the
people
we
are
living
with
are
kind
and
nice
i
am
very
glad
of
that
said
the
colonel
then
there
was
a
pause
and
it
seemed
for
a
moment
or
two
that
none
of
them
knew
how
to
begin
a
general
conversation
colonel
osborne
was
quite
sure
by
this
time
that
he
had
come
down
to
devonshire
with
the
express
object
of
seeing
the
door
of
the
church
at
cockchaffington
and
trevelyan
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
certainly
had
not
come
to
see
her
have
you
heard
from
your
father
since
you
have
been
here
asked
the
colonel
then
there
was
an
explanation
about
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
trevelyan
name
was
not
mentioned
but
trevelyan
stated
that
she
had
explained
to
her
mother
all
the
painful
circumstances
of
her
present
life
sir
marmaduke
as
colonel
osborne
was
aware
was
expected
to
be
in
england
in
the
spring
and
lady
rowley
would
of
course
come
with
him
nora
thought
that
they
might
probably
now
come
before
that
time
but
trevelyan
declared
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
they
should
do
so
she
was
sure
that
her
father
could
not
leave
the
islands
except
when
he
did
so
in
obedience
to
official
orders
the
expense
of
doing
so
would
be
ruinous
to
him
and
what
good
would
he
do
in
this
way
there
was
a
great
deal
of
family
conversation
in
which
colonel
osborne
was
able
to
take
a
part
but
not
a
word
was
said
about
trevelyan
nor
did
the
colonel
find
an
opportunity
of
expressing
a
spark
of
that
sentiment
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
which
he
had
made
this
journey
to
devonshire
it
is
not
pleasant
to
make
love
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
even
when
that
love
is
all
fair
and
above
board
but
it
is
quite
impracticable
to
do
so
to
a
married
lady
when
that
married
lady
sister
is
present
no
more
futile
visit
than
this
of
colonel
osborne
to
the
clock
house
was
ever
made
and
yet
though
not
a
word
was
spoken
to
which
trevelyan
himself
could
have
taken
the
slightest
exception
the
visit
futile
as
it
was
could
not
but
do
an
enormous
deal
of
harm
crocket
had
already
guessed
that
the
fine
gentleman
down
from
london
was
the
lover
of
the
married
lady
at
the
clock
house
who
was
separated
from
her
husband
the
postman
and
the
ostler
were
not
long
in
connecting
the
man
among
the
tombstones
with
the
visitor
to
the
house
trevelyan
as
we
are
aware
already
knew
that
colonel
osborne
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
poor
priscilla
stanbury
was
now
exposed
to
the
terrible
necessity
of
owning
the
truth
to
her
aunt
the
colonel
when
he
had
sat
an
hour
with
his
young
friends
took
his
leave
and
as
he
walked
back
to
crocket
and
ordered
that
his
fly
might
be
got
ready
for
him
his
mind
was
heavy
with
the
disagreeable
feeling
that
he
had
made
an
ass
of
himself
the
whole
affair
had
been
a
failure
and
though
he
might
be
able
to
pass
off
the
porch
at
cockchaffington
among
his
friends
he
could
not
but
be
aware
himself
that
he
had
spent
his
time
his
trouble
and
his
money
for
nothing
he
became
aware
as
he
returned
to
lessboro
that
had
he
intended
to
make
any
pleasant
use
whatever
of
his
position
in
reference
to
trevelyan
the
tone
of
his
letter
and
his
whole
mode
of
proceeding
should
have
been
less
patriarchal
and
he
should
have
contrived
a
meeting
without
the
presence
of
nora
rowley
as
soon
as
he
had
left
them
trevelyan
went
to
her
own
room
and
nora
at
once
rejoined
priscilla
is
he
gone
asked
priscilla
oh
yes
he
has
gone
what
would
i
have
given
that
he
had
never
come
and
yet
said
nora
what
harm
has
he
done
i
wish
he
had
not
come
because
of
course
people
will
talk
but
nothing
was
more
natural
than
that
he
should
come
over
to
see
us
when
he
was
so
near
us
nora
what
do
you
mean
you
do
believe
all
that
in
the
neighbourhood
i
believe
he
came
on
purpose
to
see
your
sister
and
i
think
that
it
was
a
dastardly
and
most
thing
to
do
i
am
quite
sure
you
are
wrong
then
altogether
wrong
said
nora
very
well
we
must
have
our
own
opinions
i
am
glad
you
can
be
so
charitable
but
he
should
not
have
come
here
to
this
house
even
though
imperative
business
had
brought
him
into
the
very
village
but
men
in
their
vanity
never
think
of
the
injury
they
may
do
to
a
woman
name
now
i
must
go
and
write
to
my
aunt
i
am
not
going
to
have
it
said
hereafter
that
i
deceived
her
and
then
i
shall
write
to
hugh
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
am
afraid
we
are
a
great
trouble
to
you
i
will
not
deceive
you
because
i
like
you
this
is
a
great
trouble
to
me
i
have
meant
to
be
so
prudent
and
with
all
my
prudence
i
have
not
been
able
to
keep
clear
of
rocks
and
i
have
been
so
indignant
with
aunt
stanbury
now
i
must
go
and
eat
then
she
eat
after
the
following
fashion
dear
aunt
stanbury
after
what
has
passed
between
us
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
that
colonel
osborne
has
been
at
nuncombe
putney
and
that
he
called
at
the
clock
house
this
morning
we
did
not
see
him
but
trevelyan
and
miss
rowley
together
did
see
him
he
remained
here
perhaps
an
hour
i
should
not
have
thought
it
necessary
to
mention
this
to
you
the
matter
being
one
in
which
you
are
not
concerned
were
it
not
for
our
former
correspondence
when
i
last
wrote
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
coming
nor
had
mamma
and
when
you
first
wrote
he
was
not
even
expected
by
trevelyan
the
man
you
wrote
about
was
another
gentleman
as
i
told
you
before
all
this
is
most
disagreeable
and
tiresome
and
would
be
quite
nonsensical
but
that
circumstances
seem
to
make
it
necessary
as
for
colonel
osborne
i
wish
he
had
not
been
here
but
his
coming
would
do
no
harm
only
that
it
will
be
talked
about
i
think
you
will
understand
how
it
is
that
i
feel
myself
constrained
to
write
to
you
i
do
hope
that
you
will
spare
mamma
who
is
disturbed
and
harassed
when
she
gets
angry
letters
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
myself
i
mind
it
yours
truly
priscilla
stanbury
the
clock
house
friday
august
she
wrote
also
to
her
brother
hugh
but
hugh
himself
reached
nuncombe
putney
before
the
letter
reached
him
bozzle
watched
the
colonel
out
of
the
house
and
watched
him
out
of
the
village
when
the
colonel
was
fairly
started
bozzle
walked
back
to
lessboro
chapter
xxii
shewing
how
miss
stanbury
behaved
to
her
two
nieces
illustration
the
triumph
of
miss
stanbury
when
she
received
her
niece
letter
was
certainly
very
great
so
great
that
in
its
first
flush
she
could
not
restrain
herself
from
exhibiting
it
to
dorothy
well
well
what
do
you
think
dolly
about
what
aunt
i
do
know
who
the
letter
is
from
nobody
writes
to
me
now
so
constant
as
your
sister
priscilla
the
letter
is
from
priscilla
colonel
osborne
has
been
at
the
clock
house
after
all
i
knew
that
he
would
be
there
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
dorothy
when
she
heard
this
was
dumbfounded
she
had
rested
her
defence
of
her
mother
and
sister
on
the
impossibility
of
any
such
visit
being
admitted
according
to
her
lights
the
coming
of
colonel
osborne
after
all
that
had
been
said
would
be
like
the
coming
of
lucifer
himself
the
colonel
was
to
her
imagination
a
horrible
roaring
lion
she
had
no
idea
that
the
erratic
manoeuvres
of
such
a
beast
might
be
milder
and
more
innocent
than
the
wooing
of
any
she
would
have
asked
whether
the
roaring
lion
had
gone
away
again
and
if
so
whether
he
had
taken
his
prey
with
him
were
it
not
that
she
was
too
much
frightened
at
the
moment
to
ask
any
question
that
her
mother
and
sister
should
have
been
wilfully
concerned
in
such
iniquity
was
quite
incredible
to
her
but
yet
she
did
not
know
how
to
defend
them
but
are
you
quite
sure
of
it
aunt
stanbury
may
there
not
be
another
mistake
no
mistake
this
time
i
think
my
dear
any
way
priscilla
says
that
he
is
there
now
in
this
there
was
a
mistake
priscilla
had
said
nothing
of
the
kind
you
do
mean
that
he
is
staying
at
the
clock
house
aunt
stanbury
i
do
know
where
he
is
now
i
not
his
keeper
and
i
glad
to
say
i
not
the
lady
keeper
either
ah
me
it
a
bad
business
you
ca
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
my
dear
if
your
mother
wanted
the
clock
house
i
would
sooner
have
taken
it
for
her
myself
than
that
all
this
should
have
happened
for
the
family
sake
but
miss
stanbury
when
she
was
alone
and
when
she
had
read
her
niece
three
letters
again
and
again
began
to
understand
something
of
priscilla
honesty
and
began
also
to
perceive
that
there
might
have
been
a
great
difficulty
respecting
the
colonel
for
which
neither
her
niece
nor
her
could
fairly
be
held
to
be
responsible
it
was
perhaps
the
plainest
characteristic
of
all
the
stanburys
that
they
were
never
wilfully
dishonest
ignorant
prejudiced
and
passionate
they
might
be
in
her
anger
miss
stanbury
of
exeter
could
be
almost
malicious
and
her
niece
at
nuncombe
putney
was
very
like
her
aunt
each
could
say
most
cruel
things
most
unjust
things
when
actuated
by
a
mistaken
consciousness
of
perfect
right
on
her
own
side
but
neither
of
them
could
lie
even
by
silence
let
an
error
be
brought
home
to
either
of
them
so
as
to
be
acknowledged
at
home
and
the
error
would
be
assuredly
confessed
aloud
and
indeed
with
differences
in
the
shades
hugh
and
dorothy
were
of
the
same
nature
they
were
possessed
of
sweeter
tempers
than
their
aunt
and
sister
but
they
were
filled
with
the
same
eager
readiness
to
believe
themselves
to
be
right
and
to
own
themselves
to
others
to
be
wrong
when
they
had
been
constrained
to
make
such
confession
to
themselves
the
chances
of
life
and
something
probably
of
inner
nature
had
made
dorothy
mild
and
obedient
whereas
in
regard
to
hugh
the
circumstances
of
his
life
and
disposition
had
made
him
obstinate
and
but
in
all
was
to
be
found
the
same
belief
in
self
which
amounted
almost
to
conceit
the
same
warmth
of
affection
and
the
same
love
of
justice
when
miss
stanbury
had
again
perused
the
correspondence
and
had
come
to
see
dimly
how
things
had
gone
at
nuncombe
putney
when
the
conviction
came
upon
her
mind
that
priscilla
had
entertained
a
horror
as
to
the
coming
of
this
colonel
equal
to
that
which
she
herself
had
felt
when
her
imagination
painted
to
her
all
that
her
niece
had
suffered
her
heart
was
softened
somewhat
she
had
declared
to
dorothy
that
pitch
if
touched
would
certainly
defile
and
she
had
at
first
intended
to
send
the
same
opinion
couched
in
very
forcible
words
to
her
correspondents
at
the
clock
house
they
should
not
continue
to
go
astray
for
want
of
being
told
that
they
were
going
astray
it
must
be
acknowledged
too
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
ignoble
wrath
in
the
bosom
of
miss
stanbury
because
her
had
taken
the
clock
house
she
had
never
been
told
and
had
not
even
condescended
to
ask
dorothy
whether
the
house
was
taken
and
paid
for
by
her
nephew
on
behalf
of
his
mother
or
whether
it
was
paid
for
by
trevelyan
on
behalf
of
his
wife
in
the
latter
case
stanbury
would
she
thought
be
little
more
than
an
upper
servant
or
keeper
as
she
expressed
it
to
herself
such
an
arrangement
appeared
to
her
to
be
quite
disgraceful
in
a
stanbury
but
yet
she
believed
that
such
must
be
the
existing
arrangement
as
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
conceive
that
hugh
stanbury
could
keep
such
an
establishment
over
his
mother
head
out
of
money
earned
by
writing
for
a
penny
newspaper
there
would
be
a
triumph
of
democracy
in
this
which
would
vanquish
her
altogether
she
had
therefore
been
anxious
enough
to
trample
on
priscilla
and
upon
all
the
affairs
of
the
clock
house
but
yet
she
had
been
unable
to
ignore
the
nobility
of
priscilla
truth
and
having
acknowledged
it
to
herself
she
found
herself
compelled
to
acknowledge
it
aloud
she
sat
down
to
think
in
silence
and
it
was
not
till
she
had
fortified
herself
by
her
first
draught
of
beer
and
till
she
had
finished
her
first
portion
of
bread
and
cheese
that
she
spoke
i
have
written
to
your
sister
herself
this
time
she
said
i
do
know
that
i
ever
wrote
a
line
to
her
before
in
my
life
poor
priscilla
dorothy
did
not
mean
to
be
severe
on
her
aunt
either
in
regard
to
the
letters
which
had
not
been
written
or
to
the
one
letter
which
now
had
been
written
but
dorothy
pitied
her
sister
whom
she
felt
to
be
in
trouble
well
i
do
know
about
her
being
so
poor
priscilla
i
be
bound
thinks
as
well
of
herself
as
any
of
us
do
she
cut
her
fingers
off
before
she
mean
to
do
wrong
said
dorothy
but
what
does
that
come
to
what
the
good
of
that
it
meaning
to
do
right
that
will
save
us
for
aught
i
know
the
radicals
may
mean
to
do
right
beales
means
to
do
right
perhaps
but
aunt
if
everybody
did
the
best
they
could
tush
my
dear
you
are
getting
beyond
your
depth
there
are
such
things
still
thank
god
as
spiritual
pastors
and
masters
entrust
yourself
to
them
do
what
they
think
right
now
if
aught
were
known
in
exeter
of
miss
stanbury
this
was
known
that
if
any
clergyman
volunteered
to
give
to
her
unasked
and
uninvited
counsel
either
ghostly
or
bodily
that
clergyman
would
be
sent
from
her
presence
with
a
wigging
which
he
would
not
soon
forget
the
thing
had
been
tried
more
than
once
and
the
wigging
had
been
complete
there
was
no
more
attentive
listener
in
church
than
miss
stanbury
and
she
would
now
and
again
appeal
to
a
clergyman
on
some
knotty
point
but
for
the
ordinary
authority
of
spiritual
pastors
and
masters
she
shewed
more
of
abstract
reverence
than
of
practical
obedience
i
sure
priscilla
does
the
best
she
can
said
dorothy
going
back
to
the
old
subject
ah
well
yes
what
i
want
to
say
about
priscilla
is
this
it
is
a
thousand
pities
she
is
so
obstinate
so
so
certain
that
she
can
manage
everything
for
herself
better
than
anybody
else
can
for
her
miss
stanbury
was
striving
to
say
something
good
of
her
niece
but
found
the
task
to
be
difficult
and
distasteful
to
her
she
has
managed
for
mamma
ever
so
many
years
and
since
she
took
it
we
have
hardly
ever
been
in
debt
said
dorothy
she
do
all
that
i
do
doubt
i
do
suppose
she
cares
much
for
ribbons
and
false
hair
for
herself
who
priscilla
the
idea
of
priscilla
with
false
hair
i
dare
say
not
i
dare
say
not
i
do
not
think
she
spend
her
mother
money
on
things
of
that
kind
aunt
stanbury
you
do
know
her
ah
very
well
perhaps
i
do
but
come
my
dear
you
are
very
hard
upon
me
and
very
anxious
to
take
your
sister
part
and
what
is
it
all
about
i
just
written
to
her
as
civil
a
letter
as
one
woman
ever
wrote
to
another
and
if
i
had
chosen
i
could
have
could
have
h
m
miss
stanbury
as
she
hesitated
for
words
in
which
to
complete
her
sentence
revelled
in
the
strength
of
the
vituperation
which
she
could
have
poured
upon
her
niece
head
had
she
chosen
to
write
her
last
letter
about
colonel
osborne
in
her
severe
strain
if
you
have
written
kindly
to
her
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
said
dorothy
the
truth
is
priscilla
has
meant
to
be
right
meaning
wo
go
for
much
when
the
account
is
taken
unless
the
meaning
comes
from
a
proper
source
but
the
poor
girl
has
done
as
well
as
she
has
known
how
i
believe
it
is
hugh
fault
more
than
anybody
else
this
accusation
was
not
pleasant
to
dorothy
but
she
was
too
intent
just
now
on
priscilla
case
to
defend
her
brother
that
man
never
ought
to
have
been
there
and
that
woman
never
ought
to
have
been
there
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
about
that
if
priscilla
were
sitting
there
opposite
to
me
she
would
own
as
much
i
am
sure
she
would
miss
stanbury
was
quite
right
if
she
meant
to
assert
that
priscilla
had
owned
as
much
to
herself
and
because
i
think
so
i
am
willing
to
forgive
her
part
in
the
matter
to
me
personally
she
has
always
been
rude
most
uncourteous
and
and
and
unlike
a
younger
woman
to
an
older
one
and
an
aunt
and
all
that
i
suppose
it
is
because
she
hates
me
oh
no
aunt
stanbury
my
dear
i
suppose
it
is
why
else
should
she
treat
me
in
such
a
way
but
i
do
believe
of
her
that
she
would
rather
eat
an
honest
dry
crust
than
dishonest
cake
and
ale
she
would
rather
starve
than
pick
up
a
crumb
that
was
dishonest
said
dorothy
fairly
bursting
out
into
tears
i
believe
it
i
do
believe
it
there
what
more
can
i
say
clock
house
indeed
what
matter
what
house
you
live
in
so
that
you
can
pay
the
rent
of
it
honestly
but
the
rent
is
paid
honestly
said
dorothy
amidst
her
sobs
it
paid
i
do
doubt
i
dare
say
the
woman
husband
and
your
brother
see
to
that
among
them
oh
that
my
boy
hugh
as
he
used
to
be
should
have
brought
us
all
to
this
but
there
no
knowing
what
they
wo
do
among
them
reform
indeed
murder
sacrilege
adultery
treason
atheism
that
what
reform
means
besides
every
kind
of
nastiness
under
the
sun
in
which
latter
category
miss
stanbury
intended
especially
to
include
bad
printer
ink
and
paper
made
of
straw
the
reader
may
as
well
see
the
letter
which
was
as
civil
a
letter
as
ever
one
woman
wrote
to
another
so
that
the
collection
of
the
stanbury
correspondence
may
be
made
perfect
the
close
august
my
dear
niece
your
letter
has
not
astonished
me
nearly
as
much
as
you
expected
it
would
i
am
an
older
woman
than
you
and
though
you
will
not
believe
it
i
have
seen
more
of
the
world
i
knew
that
the
gentleman
would
come
after
the
lady
such
gentlemen
always
do
go
after
their
ladies
as
for
yourself
i
can
see
all
that
you
have
done
and
pretty
nearly
hear
all
that
you
have
said
as
plain
as
a
i
do
you
the
credit
of
believing
that
the
plan
is
none
of
your
making
i
know
who
made
the
plan
and
a
very
bad
plan
it
is
as
to
my
former
letters
and
the
other
man
i
understand
all
about
it
you
were
very
angry
that
i
should
accuse
you
of
having
this
man
at
the
house
and
you
were
right
to
be
angry
i
respect
you
for
having
been
angry
but
what
does
all
that
say
as
to
his
coming
now
that
he
has
come
if
you
will
consent
to
take
an
old
woman
advice
get
rid
of
the
whole
boiling
of
them
i
say
it
in
firm
love
and
friendship
for
i
am
your
affectionate
aunt
jemima
stanbury
the
special
vaunted
courtesy
of
this
letter
consisted
no
doubt
in
the
expression
of
respect
which
it
contained
and
in
that
declaration
of
affection
with
which
it
terminated
the
epithet
was
one
which
miss
stanbury
would
by
no
means
use
promiscuously
in
writing
to
her
nearest
relatives
she
had
not
intended
to
use
it
when
she
commenced
her
letter
to
priscilla
but
the
respect
of
which
she
had
spoken
had
glowed
and
had
warmed
itself
into
something
of
temporary
love
and
feeling
at
the
moment
that
she
was
an
affectionate
aunt
miss
stanbury
had
so
put
herself
down
in
her
letter
having
done
such
a
deed
she
felt
that
dorothy
though
dorothy
knew
nothing
about
it
ought
in
her
gratitude
to
listen
patiently
to
anything
that
she
might
now
choose
to
say
against
priscilla
but
dorothy
was
in
truth
very
miserable
and
in
her
misery
wrote
a
long
letter
that
afternoon
to
her
mother
which
however
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
place
entire
among
the
stanbury
records
begging
that
she
might
be
informed
as
to
the
true
circumstances
of
the
case
she
did
not
say
a
word
of
censure
in
regard
either
to
her
mother
or
sister
but
she
expressed
an
opinion
in
the
mildest
words
which
she
could
use
that
if
anything
had
happened
which
had
compromised
their
names
since
their
residence
at
the
clock
house
she
dorothy
had
better
go
home
and
join
them
the
meaning
of
which
was
that
it
would
not
become
her
to
remain
in
the
house
in
the
close
if
the
house
in
the
close
would
be
disgraced
by
her
presence
poor
dorothy
had
taught
herself
to
think
that
the
iniquity
of
roaring
lions
spread
itself
very
widely
in
the
afternoon
she
made
some
such
proposition
to
her
aunt
in
ambiguous
terms
go
home
said
miss
stanbury
now
if
you
think
it
best
aunt
stanbury
and
put
yourself
in
the
middle
of
all
this
iniquity
and
abomination
i
do
suppose
you
want
to
know
the
woman
no
indeed
or
the
man
oh
aunt
stanbury
it
my
belief
that
no
decent
gentleman
in
exeter
would
look
at
you
again
if
you
were
to
go
and
live
among
them
at
nuncombe
putney
while
all
this
is
going
on
no
no
let
one
of
you
be
saved
out
of
it
at
least
aunt
stanbury
had
more
than
once
made
use
of
expressions
which
brought
the
faintest
touch
of
gentle
pink
up
to
her
niece
cheeks
we
must
do
dorothy
the
justice
of
saying
that
she
had
never
dreamed
of
being
looked
at
by
any
gentleman
whether
decent
or
indecent
her
life
at
nuncombe
putney
had
been
of
such
a
nature
that
though
she
knew
that
other
girls
were
looked
at
and
even
made
love
to
and
that
they
got
married
and
had
children
no
dim
vision
of
such
a
career
for
herself
had
ever
presented
itself
to
her
eyes
she
had
known
very
well
that
her
mother
and
sister
and
herself
were
people
apart
ladies
and
yet
so
extremely
poor
that
they
could
only
maintain
their
rank
by
the
most
rigid
seclusion
to
live
and
work
unseen
was
what
the
world
had
ordained
for
her
then
her
call
to
exeter
had
come
upon
her
and
she
had
conceived
that
she
was
henceforth
to
be
the
humble
companion
of
a
very
imperious
old
aunt
her
aunt
indeed
was
imperious
but
did
not
seem
to
require
humility
in
her
companion
all
the
good
things
that
were
eaten
and
drunk
were
divided
between
them
with
the
strictest
impartiality
cushion
and
hassock
in
the
church
and
in
the
cathedral
were
the
same
as
her
aunt
her
was
made
very
comfortable
for
her
her
aunt
never
gave
her
any
orders
before
company
and
always
spoke
of
her
before
the
servants
as
one
whom
they
were
to
obey
and
respect
gradually
dorothy
came
to
understand
the
meaning
of
this
but
her
aunt
would
sometimes
say
things
about
young
men
which
she
did
not
quite
understand
could
it
be
that
her
aunt
supposed
that
any
young
man
would
come
and
wish
to
marry
her
her
dorothy
stanbury
she
herself
had
not
quite
so
strong
an
aversion
to
men
in
general
as
that
which
priscilla
felt
but
she
had
not
as
yet
found
that
any
of
those
whom
she
had
seen
at
exeter
were
peculiarly
agreeable
to
her
before
she
went
to
bed
that
night
her
aunt
said
a
word
to
her
which
startled
her
more
than
she
had
ever
been
startled
before
on
that
evening
miss
stanbury
had
a
few
friends
to
drink
tea
with
her
there
were
and
crumbie
and
machugh
of
course
and
the
cheritons
from
alphington
and
the
miss
apjohns
from
helion
villa
and
old
powel
all
the
way
from
haldon
and
two
of
the
wrights
from
their
house
in
the
northernhay
and
gibson
but
the
miss
frenches
from
heavitree
were
not
there
why
do
you
have
the
miss
frenches
aunt
dorothy
had
asked
bother
the
miss
frenches
i
not
bound
to
have
them
every
time
there
camilla
has
been
and
got
herself
a
on
the
back
of
her
head
a
great
deal
bigger
than
the
place
inside
where
her
brains
ought
to
be
but
the
at
the
back
of
camilla
french
head
was
not
the
sole
cause
of
the
omission
of
the
two
sisters
from
the
list
of
miss
stanbury
visitors
on
this
occasion
the
party
went
off
very
much
as
usual
there
were
two
whist
tables
for
miss
stanbury
could
not
bear
to
cut
out
at
other
houses
than
her
own
when
there
was
cutting
out
it
was
quite
understood
that
miss
stanbury
was
to
be
allowed
to
keep
her
place
i
go
away
and
sit
out
there
by
myself
if
you
like
she
would
say
but
she
was
never
thus
banished
and
at
her
own
house
she
usually
contrived
that
there
should
be
no
system
of
banishment
she
would
play
dummy
whist
preferring
it
to
the
game
and
when
hard
driven
and
with
a
meet
opponent
would
not
even
despise
it
was
told
of
her
and
of
machugh
that
they
had
played
for
a
whole
evening
together
and
they
who
were
given
to
calumny
had
declared
that
the
candles
on
that
evening
had
been
lighted
very
early
on
the
present
occasion
a
great
many
sixpenny
points
were
scored
and
much
tea
and
cake
were
consumed
gibson
never
played
whist
nor
did
dorothy
that
young
john
wright
and
mary
cheriton
should
do
nothing
but
talk
to
each
other
was
a
thing
of
course
as
they
were
to
be
married
in
a
month
or
two
then
there
was
ida
cheriton
who
could
not
very
well
be
left
at
home
and
gibson
made
himself
pleasant
to
dorothy
and
ida
cheriton
instead
of
making
himself
pleasant
to
the
two
miss
frenches
gentlemen
in
provincial
towns
quite
understand
that
from
the
nature
of
social
circumstances
in
the
provinces
they
should
always
be
ready
to
be
pleasant
at
least
to
a
pair
at
a
time
at
a
few
minutes
before
twelve
they
were
all
gone
and
then
came
the
shock
dolly
my
dear
what
do
you
think
of
mr
gibson
think
of
him
aunt
stanbury
yes
think
of
him
think
of
him
i
suppose
you
know
how
to
think
he
seems
to
me
always
to
preach
very
drawling
sermons
oh
bother
his
sermons
i
do
care
anything
about
his
sermons
now
he
is
a
very
good
clergyman
and
the
dean
thinks
very
much
about
him
i
am
glad
of
that
aunt
stanbury
then
came
the
shock
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
you
were
to
become
mrs
gibson
it
may
be
presumed
that
miss
stanbury
had
assured
herself
that
she
could
not
make
progress
with
dorothy
by
beating
about
the
bush
there
was
an
inaptitude
in
her
niece
to
comprehend
the
advantages
of
the
situations
which
made
some
direct
explanation
absolutely
necessary
dorothy
stood
when
she
heard
the
proposition
her
cheeks
suffused
with
that
pink
colour
and
with
both
her
hands
extended
with
surprise
i
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
you
been
here
said
miss
stanbury
i
think
he
likes
miss
french
said
dorothy
in
a
whisper
which
of
them
i
do
believe
he
likes
them
at
all
maybe
if
they
go
on
long
enough
they
may
be
able
to
toss
up
for
him
but
i
think
it
of
him
of
course
they
after
him
but
he
be
too
wise
for
them
and
he
more
of
a
fool
than
i
take
him
to
be
if
he
prefer
you
to
them
dorothy
remained
quite
silent
to
such
an
address
as
this
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
reply
a
word
it
was
incredible
to
her
that
any
man
should
prefer
herself
to
either
of
the
young
women
in
question
but
she
was
too
much
confounded
for
the
expression
even
of
her
humility
at
any
rate
you
wholesome
and
pleasant
and
modest
said
miss
stanbury
dorothy
did
not
quite
like
being
told
that
she
was
wholesome
but
nevertheless
she
was
thankful
to
her
aunt
i
tell
you
what
it
is
continued
miss
stanbury
i
hate
all
mysteries
especially
with
those
i
love
i
saved
two
thousand
pounds
which
i
put
you
down
for
in
my
will
now
if
you
and
he
can
make
it
up
together
i
give
you
the
money
at
once
there
no
knowing
how
often
an
old
woman
may
alter
her
will
but
when
got
a
thing
you
got
it
gibson
would
know
the
meaning
of
a
bird
in
the
hand
as
well
as
anybody
now
those
girls
at
heavitree
will
never
have
above
a
few
hundreds
each
and
not
that
while
their
mother
lives
dorothy
made
one
little
attempt
at
squeezing
her
aunt
hand
wishing
to
thank
her
aunt
for
this
affectionate
generosity
but
she
had
hardly
accomplished
the
squeeze
when
she
desisted
feeling
strangely
averse
to
any
acknowledgment
of
such
a
boon
as
that
which
had
been
offered
to
her
and
now
good
night
my
dear
if
i
did
not
think
you
a
very
sensible
young
woman
i
should
not
trust
you
by
saying
all
this
then
they
parted
and
dorothy
soon
found
herself
alone
in
her
bedroom
to
have
a
husband
of
her
own
a
perfect
gentleman
too
and
a
clergyman
and
to
go
to
him
with
a
fortune
she
believed
that
two
thousand
pounds
represented
nearly
a
hundred
a
year
it
was
a
large
fortune
in
those
parts
according
to
her
understanding
of
fortunes
and
that
she
the
humblest
of
the
humble
should
be
selected
for
so
honourable
a
position
she
had
never
quite
known
quite
understood
as
yet
whether
she
had
made
good
her
footing
in
her
aunt
house
in
a
manner
pleasant
to
her
aunt
more
than
once
or
twice
she
had
spoken
even
of
going
back
to
her
mother
and
things
had
been
said
which
had
almost
made
her
think
that
her
aunt
had
been
angry
with
her
but
now
after
a
month
or
two
of
joint
residence
her
aunt
was
offering
to
her
two
thousand
pounds
and
a
husband
but
was
it
within
her
aunt
power
to
offer
to
her
the
husband
gibson
had
always
been
very
civil
to
her
she
had
spoken
more
to
gibson
than
to
any
other
man
in
exeter
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
for
a
moment
that
gibson
had
any
special
liking
for
her
was
it
probable
that
he
would
ever
entertain
any
feeling
of
that
kind
for
her
it
certainly
had
occurred
to
her
before
now
that
gibson
was
sometimes
bored
by
the
miss
frenches
but
then
gentlemen
do
get
bored
by
ladies
and
at
last
she
asked
herself
another
question
had
she
any
special
liking
for
gibson
as
far
as
she
understood
such
matters
everything
was
blank
there
thinking
of
that
other
question
she
went
to
sleep
chapter
xxiii
colonel
osborne
and
bozzle
return
to
london
hugh
stanbury
went
down
on
the
saturday
by
the
early
express
to
exeter
on
his
road
to
lessboro
he
took
his
ticket
through
to
lessboro
not
purposing
to
stay
at
exeter
but
from
the
exigencies
of
the
various
trains
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
remain
for
half
an
hour
at
the
exeter
station
this
took
place
on
the
saturday
and
colonel
osborne
visit
to
the
clock
house
had
been
made
on
the
friday
colonel
osborne
had
returned
to
lessboro
had
slept
again
at
clegg
house
and
returned
to
london
on
the
saturday
it
so
happened
that
he
also
was
obliged
to
spend
half
an
hour
at
the
exeter
station
and
that
his
and
hugh
stanbury
were
one
and
the
same
they
met
therefore
as
a
matter
of
course
upon
the
platform
stanbury
was
the
first
to
see
the
other
and
he
found
that
he
must
determine
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
what
he
would
say
and
what
he
would
do
he
had
received
no
direct
commission
from
trevelyan
as
to
his
meeting
with
colonel
osborne
trevelyan
had
declared
that
as
to
the
matter
of
quarrelling
he
meant
to
retain
the
privilege
of
doing
that
for
himself
but
stanbury
had
quite
understood
that
this
was
only
the
vague
expression
of
an
angry
man
the
colonel
had
taken
a
glass
of
sherry
and
had
lighted
a
cigar
and
was
quite
comfortable
having
thrown
aside
for
a
time
that
consciousness
of
the
futility
of
his
journey
which
had
perplexed
him
when
stanbury
accosted
him
what
stanbury
how
do
you
do
fine
day
is
it
are
you
going
up
or
down
i
going
to
see
my
own
people
at
nuncombe
putney
a
village
beyond
lessboro
said
hugh
ah
indeed
colonel
osborne
of
course
perceived
at
once
that
as
this
man
was
going
to
the
house
at
which
he
had
just
been
visiting
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
himself
explain
what
he
had
done
if
he
were
to
allow
this
mention
of
nuncombe
putney
to
pass
without
saying
that
he
himself
had
been
there
he
would
be
convicted
of
at
least
some
purpose
of
secrecy
in
what
he
had
been
doing
very
strange
said
he
i
was
at
nuncombe
putney
myself
yesterday
i
know
you
were
said
stanbury
and
how
did
you
know
it
there
had
been
a
tone
of
anger
in
stanbury
voice
which
colonel
osborne
had
at
once
appreciated
and
which
made
him
assume
a
similar
tone
as
they
spoke
there
was
a
man
standing
in
a
corner
close
by
the
bookstall
with
his
eye
upon
them
and
that
man
was
bozzle
the
who
was
doing
his
duty
with
sedulous
activity
by
seeing
the
colonel
back
to
london
now
bozzle
did
not
know
hugh
stanbury
and
was
angry
with
himself
that
he
should
be
so
ignorant
it
is
the
pride
of
a
detective
to
know
everybody
that
comes
in
his
way
well
i
had
been
so
informed
my
friend
trevelyan
knew
that
you
were
there
or
that
you
were
going
there
i
do
care
who
knew
that
i
was
going
there
said
the
colonel
i
wo
pretend
to
understand
how
that
may
be
colonel
osborne
but
i
think
you
must
be
aware
after
what
took
place
in
curzon
street
that
it
would
have
been
better
that
you
should
not
have
attempted
to
see
trevelyan
whether
you
have
seen
her
i
do
not
know
what
business
is
it
of
yours
stanbury
whether
i
have
seen
that
lady
or
not
unhappily
for
me
her
husband
has
made
it
my
business
very
unhappily
for
you
i
should
say
and
the
lady
is
staying
at
my
mother
house
i
presume
the
lady
is
not
a
prisoner
in
your
mother
house
and
that
your
mother
hospitality
is
not
so
restricted
but
that
her
guest
may
see
an
old
friend
under
her
roof
this
colonel
osborne
said
with
an
assumed
look
of
almost
righteous
indignation
which
was
not
at
all
lost
upon
bozzle
they
had
returned
back
towards
the
bookstall
and
bozzle
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
copy
of
the
which
he
had
just
bought
was
straining
his
ears
to
the
utmost
to
catch
what
was
being
said
you
best
know
whether
you
have
seen
her
or
not
i
have
seen
her
then
i
shall
take
leave
to
tell
you
colonel
osborne
that
you
have
acted
in
a
most
unfriendly
way
and
have
done
that
which
must
tend
to
keep
an
affectionate
husband
apart
from
his
wife
sir
i
do
at
all
understand
this
kind
of
thing
addressed
to
me
the
father
of
the
lady
you
are
speaking
of
has
been
my
most
intimate
friend
for
thirty
years
after
all
the
colonel
was
a
mean
man
when
he
could
take
pride
in
his
youth
and
defend
himself
on
the
score
of
his
age
in
one
and
the
same
proceeding
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
replied
stanbury
you
have
said
too
much
already
mr
stanbury
i
think
not
colonel
osborne
you
have
i
fear
done
an
incredible
deal
of
mischief
by
going
to
nuncombe
putney
and
after
all
that
you
have
heard
on
the
subject
you
must
have
known
that
it
would
be
mischievous
i
can
not
understand
how
you
can
force
yourself
about
a
man
wife
against
the
man
expressed
wish
sir
i
did
force
myself
upon
anybody
sir
i
went
down
to
see
an
old
friend
and
a
remarkable
piece
of
antiquity
and
when
another
old
friend
was
in
the
neighbourhood
close
by
one
of
the
oldest
friends
i
have
in
the
world
was
i
to
go
and
see
her
god
bless
my
soul
what
business
is
it
of
yours
i
never
heard
such
impudence
in
my
life
let
the
charitable
reader
suppose
that
colonel
osborne
did
not
know
that
he
was
lying
that
he
really
thought
when
he
spoke
that
he
had
gone
down
to
lessboro
to
see
the
remarkable
piece
of
antiquity
good
morning
said
hugh
stanbury
turning
on
his
heels
and
walking
away
colonel
osborne
shook
himself
inflated
his
cheeks
and
blew
forth
the
breath
out
of
his
mouth
put
his
thumbs
up
to
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
and
walked
about
the
platform
as
though
he
thought
it
to
be
incumbent
on
him
to
show
that
he
was
somebody
somebody
that
ought
not
to
be
insulted
somebody
perhaps
whom
a
very
pretty
woman
might
prefer
to
her
own
husband
in
spite
of
a
small
difference
in
age
he
was
angry
but
not
quite
so
much
angry
as
proud
and
he
was
safe
too
he
thought
that
he
was
safe
when
he
should
come
to
account
for
himself
and
his
actions
to
his
old
friend
sir
marmaduke
he
felt
that
he
would
be
able
to
show
that
he
had
been
in
all
respects
true
to
friendship
sir
marmaduke
had
unfortunately
given
his
daughter
to
a
jealous
disagreeable
fellow
and
the
fault
all
lay
in
that
as
for
hugh
stanbury
he
would
simply
despise
hugh
stanbury
and
have
done
with
it
bozzle
though
he
had
worked
hard
in
the
cause
had
heard
but
a
word
or
two
seldom
do
hear
more
than
that
a
porter
had
already
told
him
who
was
hugh
stanbury
that
he
was
hugh
stanbury
and
that
his
aunt
lived
at
exeter
and
bozzle
knowing
that
the
lady
about
whom
he
was
concerned
was
living
with
a
stanbury
at
the
house
he
had
been
watching
put
two
and
two
together
with
his
natural
cleverness
god
bless
my
soul
what
business
is
it
of
yours
those
words
were
nearly
all
that
bozzle
had
been
able
to
hear
but
even
those
sufficiently
indicated
a
quarrel
the
lady
was
living
with
stanbury
having
been
so
placed
by
her
husband
and
young
stanbury
was
taking
the
lady
part
bozzle
began
to
fear
that
the
husband
had
not
confided
in
him
with
that
perfect
faith
which
he
felt
to
be
essentially
necessary
to
the
adequate
performance
of
the
duties
of
his
great
profession
a
sudden
thought
however
struck
him
something
might
be
done
on
the
journey
up
to
london
he
at
once
made
his
way
back
to
the
and
exchanged
his
ticket
for
it
was
a
noble
deed
the
expense
falling
all
upon
his
own
pocket
for
in
the
natural
course
of
things
he
would
have
charged
his
employers
with
the
full
fare
he
had
seen
colonel
osborne
seat
himself
in
a
carriage
and
within
two
minutes
he
was
occupying
the
opposite
place
the
colonel
was
aware
that
he
had
noticed
the
man
face
lately
but
did
not
know
where
very
fine
summer
weather
sir
said
bozzle
very
fine
said
the
colonel
burying
himself
behind
a
newspaper
they
is
getting
up
their
wheat
nicely
in
these
parts
sir
the
answer
to
this
was
no
more
than
a
grunt
but
bozzle
was
not
offended
not
to
be
offended
is
the
special
duty
of
all
policemen
in
and
out
of
office
and
the
journey
from
exeter
to
london
was
long
and
was
all
before
him
a
very
nice
little
secluded
village
is
nuncombe
putney
said
bozzle
as
the
train
was
leaving
the
salisbury
station
at
salisbury
two
ladies
had
left
the
carriage
no
one
else
had
got
in
and
bozzle
was
alone
with
the
colonel
i
dare
say
said
the
colonel
who
by
this
time
had
relinquished
his
shield
and
who
had
begun
to
compose
himself
for
sleep
or
to
pretend
to
compose
himself
as
soon
as
he
heard
bozzle
voice
he
had
been
looking
at
bozzle
and
though
he
had
not
discovered
the
man
trade
had
told
himself
that
his
companion
was
a
thing
of
dangers
a
thing
to
be
avoided
by
one
engaged
as
had
been
he
himself
on
a
special
and
secret
mission
saw
you
there
calling
at
the
clock
house
said
bozzle
very
likely
said
the
colonel
throwing
his
head
well
back
into
the
corner
shutting
his
eyes
and
uttering
a
slight
preliminary
snore
very
nice
family
of
ladies
at
the
clock
house
said
bozzle
the
colonel
answered
him
by
a
more
developed
snore
particularly
t
said
bozzle
the
colonel
could
not
stand
this
he
was
so
closely
implicated
with
trevelyan
at
the
present
moment
that
he
could
not
omit
to
notice
an
address
so
made
to
him
what
the
devil
is
that
to
you
sir
said
he
jumping
up
and
confronting
bozzle
in
his
wrath
but
policemen
have
always
this
advantage
in
their
difficulties
that
they
know
to
a
fraction
what
the
wrath
of
men
is
worth
and
what
it
can
do
sometimes
it
can
dismiss
a
policeman
and
sometimes
break
his
head
sometimes
it
can
give
him
a
long
and
troublesome
job
and
sometimes
it
may
be
wrath
to
the
death
but
in
nineteen
out
of
twenty
cases
it
is
not
a
fearful
thing
and
the
policeman
knows
well
when
he
need
not
fear
it
on
the
present
occasion
bozzle
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
colonel
osborne
wrath
well
sir
not
much
indeed
if
you
come
to
that
only
you
was
there
sir
of
course
i
was
there
said
the
colonel
and
a
very
nice
young
gentleman
is
stanbury
said
bozzle
to
this
colonel
osborne
made
no
reply
but
again
had
resort
to
his
newspaper
in
the
most
formal
manner
he
going
down
to
his
family
no
doubt
continued
bozzle
he
may
be
going
to
the
devil
for
what
i
know
said
the
colonel
who
could
not
restrain
himself
i
suppose
they
all
friends
of
mrs
asked
bozzle
sir
said
the
colonel
i
believe
that
you
a
spy
no
colonel
no
no
no
i
no
spy
i
would
demean
myself
to
be
such
a
spy
is
a
man
as
has
no
profession
and
nothing
to
justify
his
looking
into
things
things
must
be
looked
into
colonel
or
how
a
man
to
know
where
he
is
or
how
a
lady
to
know
where
she
is
but
as
for
spies
except
in
the
way
of
evidence
i
do
think
nothing
of
soon
after
this
two
more
passengers
entered
the
train
and
nothing
more
was
said
between
bozzle
and
the
colonel
the
colonel
as
soon
as
he
reached
london
went
home
to
his
lodgings
and
then
to
his
club
and
did
his
best
to
enjoy
himself
on
the
following
monday
he
intended
to
start
for
scotland
but
he
could
not
quite
enjoy
himself
because
of
bozzle
he
felt
that
he
was
being
watched
and
there
is
nothing
that
any
man
hates
so
much
as
that
especially
when
a
lady
is
concerned
colonel
osborne
knew
that
his
visit
to
nuncombe
putney
had
been
very
innocent
but
he
did
not
like
the
feeling
that
even
his
innocence
had
been
made
the
subject
of
observation
bozzle
went
away
at
once
to
trevelyan
whom
he
found
at
his
chambers
he
himself
had
had
no
very
scheme
in
his
addresses
to
colonel
osborne
he
had
begun
to
think
that
very
little
would
come
of
the
affair
especially
after
hugh
stanbury
had
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
had
felt
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
lost
by
presenting
himself
before
the
eyes
of
the
colonel
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
make
a
report
to
his
employer
and
the
report
might
be
made
a
little
more
full
after
a
few
words
with
the
man
whom
he
had
been
looking
into
well
trewillian
he
said
seating
himself
on
a
chair
close
against
the
wall
and
holding
his
hat
between
the
knees
i
seen
the
parties
and
know
pretty
much
all
about
it
all
i
want
to
know
bozzle
is
whether
colonel
osborne
has
been
at
the
clock
house
he
has
been
there
trewillian
there
is
no
earthly
doubt
about
that
from
hour
to
hour
i
can
tell
you
pretty
nearly
where
he
been
since
he
left
london
then
bozzle
took
out
his
i
do
care
about
all
that
said
trevelyan
i
dare
say
not
sir
but
it
may
be
wanted
all
the
same
any
gentleman
acting
in
our
way
ca
be
too
particular
ca
have
too
many
facts
the
smallest
little
tiddly
things
and
bozzle
as
he
said
this
seemed
to
enjoy
immensely
the
flavour
of
his
own
epithet
the
smallest
little
things
do
so
often
turn
up
trumps
when
you
get
your
evidence
into
court
i
not
going
to
get
any
evidence
into
court
maybe
not
sir
a
gentleman
and
lady
is
always
best
out
of
court
as
long
as
things
can
hang
on
any
way
but
sometimes
things
wo
hang
on
no
way
trevelyan
who
was
conscious
that
the
employment
of
bozzle
was
discreditable
and
whose
affairs
in
devonshire
were
now
in
the
hands
of
at
any
rate
a
more
honourable
ally
was
at
present
mainly
anxious
to
get
rid
of
the
i
have
no
doubt
you
been
very
careful
bozzle
said
he
there
is
no
one
in
the
business
could
be
more
so
mr
trewillian
and
you
have
found
out
what
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
know
colonel
osborne
did
go
to
the
clock
house
was
let
in
at
the
front
door
on
friday
the
by
sarah
french
the
housemaid
at
and
was
let
out
again
by
the
same
young
woman
at
perhaps
you
like
to
have
a
copy
of
the
entry
mr
trewillian
no
no
no
it
does
matter
of
course
it
be
with
me
when
it
wanted
who
was
with
him
exactly
at
that
time
i
ca
say
there
is
things
trewillian
one
ca
see
but
i
do
think
as
he
saw
neither
stanbury
nor
miss
stanbury
not
to
speak
to
i
did
just
have
one
word
promiscuous
with
sarah
french
after
he
was
gone
whether
the
other
young
lady
was
with
or
not
and
if
so
for
how
long
i
ca
say
there
is
things
trewillian
which
one
ca
see
how
trevelyan
hated
the
man
as
he
went
on
with
his
odious
details
details
not
one
of
which
possessed
the
slightest
importance
it
all
right
i
dare
say
bozzle
and
now
about
the
account
quite
so
trewillian
but
there
was
one
question
just
one
question
what
question
said
trevelyan
almost
angrily
and
there
another
thing
i
must
tell
you
too
trewillian
i
come
back
to
town
in
the
same
carriage
with
the
colonel
i
thought
it
better
you
did
not
tell
him
who
you
were
no
trewillian
i
did
tell
him
that
i
do
think
he
say
if
you
was
to
ask
him
that
i
told
him
much
of
anything
no
trewillian
i
did
tell
him
nothing
i
do
often
tell
folks
much
till
the
time
comes
but
i
thought
it
better
and
i
did
have
a
word
or
two
with
the
gent
just
a
word
or
two
he
not
so
very
downy
is
the
colonel
for
one
that
been
at
it
so
long
mr
trewillian
i
dare
say
not
but
if
you
could
just
let
me
have
the
account
bozzle
the
account
oh
yes
that
is
necessary
ai
it
these
sort
of
inquiries
do
come
a
little
expensive
trewillian
because
time
goes
for
so
much
and
when
one
has
to
be
down
on
a
thing
sharp
you
know
and
sure
so
that
counsel
on
the
other
side
ca
part
you
from
it
though
he
shakes
you
like
a
dog
does
a
rat
and
one
has
to
get
oneself
up
ready
for
all
that
you
know
trewillian
as
i
was
saying
one
ca
count
one
shillings
when
one
has
such
a
job
as
this
in
hand
clench
your
nail
that
what
i
say
be
it
even
so
clench
your
nail
that
what
you
got
to
do
i
dare
say
we
sha
quarrel
about
the
money
mr
bozzle
oh
dear
no
i
find
i
never
has
any
words
about
the
money
but
there
that
one
question
there
a
young
stanbury
has
gone
down
as
knows
all
about
it
what
he
up
to
he
my
particular
friend
said
trevelyan
oh
he
do
know
all
about
it
then
we
need
talk
about
that
if
you
please
mr
bozzle
because
there
was
words
between
him
and
the
colonel
upon
the
platform
and
very
angry
words
the
young
man
went
at
the
colonel
quite
it
not
the
way
such
things
should
be
done
trewillian
and
though
of
course
it
not
for
me
to
speak
she
your
lady
still
when
you
has
got
a
thing
of
this
kind
in
hand
one
head
is
better
than
a
dozen
as
for
myself
trewillian
i
never
would
look
at
a
case
not
if
i
knew
it
unless
i
was
to
have
it
all
to
myself
but
of
course
there
was
no
bargain
and
so
i
says
nothing
after
considerable
delay
the
bill
was
made
out
on
the
spot
bozzle
copying
down
the
figures
painfully
from
his
with
his
head
much
inclined
on
one
side
trevelyan
asked
him
almost
in
despair
to
name
the
one
sum
but
this
bozzle
declined
to
do
saying
that
right
was
right
he
had
a
scale
of
pilfering
of
his
own
to
which
he
had
easily
reconciled
his
conscience
and
beyond
that
he
prided
himself
on
the
honesty
of
his
accounts
at
last
the
bill
was
made
out
was
paid
and
bozzle
was
gone
trevelyan
when
he
was
alone
threw
himself
back
on
a
sofa
and
almost
wept
in
despair
to
what
a
depth
of
degradation
had
he
not
been
reduced
chapter
xxiv
niddon
park
as
hugh
stanbury
went
over
to
lessboro
and
from
thence
to
nuncombe
putney
he
thought
more
of
himself
and
nora
rowley
than
he
did
of
and
trevelyan
as
to
trevelyan
and
colonel
osborne
he
felt
that
he
knew
everything
that
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
know
the
man
had
been
there
and
had
seen
trevelyan
of
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
colonel
osborne
had
been
wickedly
indifferent
to
the
evil
consequences
of
such
a
visit
and
that
all
the
women
concerned
had
been
most
foolish
in
permitting
him
to
make
it
was
his
present
conviction
but
he
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
the
visit
had
in
itself
been
of
all
things
the
most
innocent
trevelyan
had
sworn
that
if
his
wife
received
the
man
at
nuncombe
putney
he
would
never
see
her
again
she
had
seen
him
and
this
oath
would
be
remembered
and
there
would
be
increased
difficulties
but
these
difficulties
whatever
they
might
be
must
be
overcome
when
he
had
told
himself
this
then
he
allowed
his
mind
to
settle
itself
on
nora
rowley
hitherto
he
had
known
miss
rowley
only
as
a
fashionable
girl
living
with
the
wife
of
an
intimate
friend
of
his
own
in
london
he
had
never
been
staying
in
the
same
house
with
her
circumstances
had
never
given
to
him
the
opportunity
of
assuming
the
manner
of
an
intimate
friend
justifying
him
in
giving
advice
and
authorising
him
to
assume
that
tone
which
is
by
far
the
easiest
preliminary
to
when
a
man
can
tell
a
young
lady
what
she
ought
to
read
what
she
ought
to
do
and
whom
she
ought
to
know
nothing
can
be
easier
than
to
assure
her
that
of
all
her
duties
her
first
duty
is
to
prefer
himself
to
all
the
world
and
any
young
lady
who
has
consented
to
receive
lessons
from
such
a
teacher
will
generally
be
willing
to
receive
this
special
lesson
among
others
but
stanbury
had
hitherto
had
no
such
opportunities
in
london
miss
rowley
had
been
a
fashionable
young
lady
living
in
mayfair
and
he
had
been
well
anything
but
a
fashionable
young
man
nevertheless
he
had
seen
her
often
had
sat
by
her
very
frequently
was
quite
sure
that
he
loved
her
dearly
and
had
perhaps
some
idea
in
his
mind
that
had
he
stuck
to
his
honourable
profession
as
a
barrister
and
were
he
possessed
of
some
comfortable
little
fortune
of
his
own
he
might
perhaps
have
been
able
after
due
siege
operations
to
make
this
charming
young
woman
his
own
things
were
quite
changed
now
for
the
present
miss
rowley
certainly
could
not
be
regarded
as
a
fashionable
london
young
lady
the
house
in
which
he
would
see
her
was
in
some
sort
his
own
he
would
be
sleeping
under
the
same
roof
with
her
and
would
have
all
the
advantages
which
such
a
position
could
give
him
he
would
have
no
difficulty
now
in
asking
if
he
should
choose
to
ask
and
he
thought
that
she
might
be
somewhat
softer
somewhat
more
likely
to
yield
at
nuncombe
putney
than
she
would
have
been
in
london
she
was
at
nuncombe
in
weak
circumstances
to
a
certain
degree
friendless
with
none
of
the
excitement
of
society
around
her
with
no
elder
sons
buzzing
about
her
and
filling
her
mind
if
not
her
heart
with
the
glories
of
luxurious
primogeniture
hugh
stanbury
certainly
did
not
dream
that
any
special
elder
son
had
as
yet
been
so
attracted
as
to
have
made
a
journey
to
nuncombe
putney
on
nora
behalf
but
should
he
on
this
account
because
she
would
be
as
it
were
without
means
of
defence
from
his
attack
should
he
therefore
take
advantage
of
her
weakness
she
would
of
course
go
back
to
her
london
life
after
some
short
absence
and
would
again
if
free
have
her
chance
among
the
favoured
ones
of
the
earth
what
had
he
to
offer
to
her
he
had
taken
the
clock
house
for
his
mother
and
it
would
be
quite
as
much
as
he
could
do
when
trevelyan
should
have
left
the
village
to
keep
up
that
establishment
and
maintain
himself
in
london
quite
as
much
as
he
could
do
even
though
the
favours
of
the
should
flow
upon
him
with
their
fullest
tides
in
such
circumstances
would
it
be
honourable
in
him
to
ask
a
girl
to
love
him
because
he
found
her
defenceless
in
his
mother
house
if
there
bai
another
for
nuncombe
said
clegg
ostler
to
clegg
boots
as
stanbury
was
driven
off
in
a
gig
that
be
young
stanbury
of
whome
they
be
all
for
the
clock
house
since
the
old
took
to
thick
there
house
there
be
folk
and
every
day
loike
it
along
of
the
madam
that
they
keeps
there
dick
said
the
boots
i
did
care
if
there
be
madams
allays
they
the
best
as
is
going
for
trade
anyhow
said
the
ostler
what
the
ostler
said
was
true
when
there
comes
to
be
a
feeling
that
a
woman
character
is
in
any
way
tarnished
there
comes
another
feeling
that
everybody
on
the
one
side
may
charge
double
and
that
everybody
on
the
other
side
must
pay
double
for
everything
hugh
stanbury
could
not
understand
why
he
was
charged
a
shilling
a
mile
instead
of
ninepence
for
the
gig
to
nuncombe
putney
he
got
no
satisfactory
answer
and
had
to
pay
the
shilling
the
truth
was
that
gigs
to
nuncombe
putney
had
gone
up
since
a
lady
separated
from
her
husband
with
a
colonel
running
after
her
had
been
taken
in
at
the
clock
house
here
hugh
said
priscilla
hurrying
to
the
front
door
and
stanbury
hurried
after
her
her
son
hugh
was
the
apple
of
her
eye
the
best
son
that
ever
lived
generous
noble
a
thorough
man
almost
a
god
dear
dear
oh
dear
who
have
expected
it
god
bless
you
my
boy
why
did
you
write
priscilla
what
is
there
in
the
house
that
he
can
eat
plenty
of
bread
and
cheese
said
priscilla
laughing
with
her
hand
inside
her
brother
arm
for
though
priscilla
hated
all
other
men
she
did
not
hate
her
brother
hugh
if
you
wanted
things
nice
to
eat
directly
you
got
here
you
ought
to
have
written
i
shall
want
my
dinner
like
any
other
christian
in
due
time
said
hugh
and
how
is
trevelyan
and
how
is
miss
rowley
he
soon
found
himself
in
company
with
those
two
ladies
and
experienced
some
immediate
difficulty
in
explaining
the
cause
of
his
sudden
coming
but
this
was
soon
put
aside
by
trevelyan
when
did
you
see
my
husband
she
asked
i
saw
him
yesterday
he
was
quite
well
colonel
osborne
has
been
here
she
said
i
know
that
he
has
been
here
i
met
him
at
the
station
at
exeter
perhaps
i
should
not
say
so
but
i
wish
he
had
remained
away
we
all
wish
it
said
priscilla
then
nora
spoke
but
what
could
we
do
stanbury
it
seemed
so
natural
that
he
should
call
when
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
we
have
known
him
so
long
and
how
could
we
refuse
to
see
him
i
will
not
let
any
one
think
that
i
afraid
to
see
any
man
on
earth
said
trevelyan
if
he
had
ever
in
his
life
said
a
word
that
he
should
not
have
said
a
word
that
would
have
been
an
insult
of
course
it
would
have
been
different
but
the
notion
of
it
is
preposterous
why
should
i
not
have
seen
him
i
think
he
was
wrong
to
come
said
hugh
of
course
he
was
wrong
wickedly
wrong
said
priscilla
stanbury
finding
that
the
subject
was
openly
discussed
between
them
declared
plainly
the
mission
that
had
brought
him
to
nuncombe
trevelyan
heard
that
he
was
coming
and
asked
me
to
let
him
know
the
truth
now
you
can
tell
him
the
truth
said
trevelyan
with
something
of
indignation
in
her
tone
as
though
she
thought
that
stanbury
had
taken
upon
himself
a
task
of
which
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
but
colonel
osborne
came
specially
to
pay
a
visit
to
cockchaffington
said
nora
and
not
to
see
us
louis
ought
to
know
that
nora
how
can
you
demean
yourself
to
care
about
such
trash
said
trevelyan
who
cares
why
he
came
here
his
visit
to
me
was
a
thing
of
course
if
trevelyan
disapproves
of
it
let
him
say
so
and
not
send
secret
messengers
am
i
a
secret
messenger
said
hugh
stanbury
there
has
been
a
man
here
inquiring
of
the
servants
said
priscilla
so
that
odious
bozzle
had
made
his
foul
mission
known
to
them
stanbury
however
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
of
bozzle
not
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
bozzle
i
am
sure
trevelyan
does
not
mean
you
said
priscilla
i
do
not
know
what
i
mean
said
trevelyan
i
am
so
harassed
and
fevered
by
these
suspicions
that
i
am
driven
nearly
mad
then
she
left
the
room
for
a
minute
and
returned
with
two
letters
there
stanbury
i
got
that
note
from
colonel
osborne
and
wrote
to
him
that
reply
you
know
all
about
it
now
can
you
say
that
i
was
wrong
to
see
him
i
am
sure
that
he
was
wrong
to
come
said
hugh
wickedly
wrong
said
priscilla
again
you
can
keep
the
letters
and
show
them
to
my
husband
said
trevelyan
then
he
will
know
all
about
it
but
stanbury
declined
to
keep
the
letters
he
was
to
remain
the
sunday
at
nuncombe
putney
and
return
to
london
on
the
monday
there
was
therefore
but
one
day
on
which
he
could
say
what
he
had
to
say
to
nora
rowley
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
on
the
sunday
morning
he
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
as
for
nora
she
was
in
a
state
of
mind
much
less
near
to
any
fixed
purpose
she
had
told
herself
that
she
loved
this
man
had
indeed
done
so
in
the
clearest
way
by
acknowledging
the
fact
of
her
love
to
another
suitor
by
pleading
to
that
other
suitor
the
fact
of
her
love
as
an
insuperable
reason
why
he
should
be
rejected
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
about
it
to
her
when
priscilla
had
declared
that
hugh
stanbury
was
at
the
door
her
heart
had
gone
into
her
mouth
involuntarily
she
had
pressed
her
hands
to
her
sides
and
had
held
her
breath
why
had
he
come
there
had
he
come
there
for
her
oh
if
he
had
come
there
for
her
and
if
she
might
dare
to
forget
all
the
future
how
sweet
sweetest
of
all
things
in
heaven
or
earth
might
be
an
august
evening
with
him
among
the
lanes
but
she
too
had
endeavoured
to
be
very
prudent
she
had
told
herself
that
she
was
quite
unfit
to
be
the
wife
of
a
poor
man
that
she
would
be
only
a
burden
round
his
neck
and
not
an
aid
to
him
and
in
so
telling
herself
she
had
told
herself
also
that
she
had
been
a
fool
not
to
accept
glascock
she
should
have
dragged
out
from
her
heart
the
image
of
this
man
who
had
never
even
whispered
a
word
of
love
in
her
ears
and
should
have
constrained
herself
to
receive
with
affection
a
man
in
loving
whom
there
ought
to
be
no
difficulty
but
when
she
had
been
repeating
those
lessons
to
herself
hugh
stanbury
had
not
been
in
the
house
now
he
was
there
and
what
must
be
her
answer
if
he
should
whisper
that
word
of
love
she
had
an
idea
that
it
would
be
treason
in
her
to
disown
the
love
she
felt
if
questioned
concerning
her
heart
by
the
man
to
whom
it
had
been
given
they
all
went
to
church
on
the
sunday
morning
and
up
to
that
time
nora
had
not
been
a
moment
alone
with
the
man
it
had
been
decided
that
they
should
dine
early
and
then
ramble
out
when
the
evening
would
be
less
hot
than
the
day
had
been
to
a
spot
called
niddon
park
this
was
nearly
three
miles
from
nuncombe
and
was
a
beautiful
wild
slope
of
ground
full
of
ancient
blighted
blasted
but
still
oaks
oaks
that
still
brought
forth
leaves
overlooking
a
bend
of
the
river
teign
park
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
there
was
none
nor
did
they
who
lived
round
nuncombe
putney
know
whether
niddon
park
had
ever
been
enclosed
but
of
all
the
spots
in
that
lovely
neighbourhood
priscilla
stanbury
swore
that
it
was
the
loveliest
and
as
it
had
never
yet
been
seen
by
trevelyan
or
her
sister
it
was
determined
that
they
would
walk
there
on
this
august
afternoon
there
were
four
of
them
and
as
was
natural
they
fell
into
parties
of
two
and
two
but
priscilla
walked
with
nora
and
hugh
stanbury
walked
with
his
friend
wife
nora
was
talkative
but
demure
in
her
manner
and
speaking
now
and
again
as
though
she
were
giving
words
and
not
thoughts
she
felt
that
there
was
something
to
hide
and
was
suffering
from
disappointment
that
their
party
should
not
have
been
otherwise
divided
had
hugh
spoken
to
her
and
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
she
could
not
have
accepted
him
because
she
knew
that
they
were
both
poor
and
that
she
was
not
fit
to
keep
a
poor
man
house
she
had
declared
to
herself
most
plainly
that
that
must
be
her
course
but
yet
she
was
disappointed
and
talked
on
with
the
knowledge
that
she
had
something
to
conceal
illustration
niddon
park
when
they
were
seated
beneath
an
old
riven
withered
oak
looking
down
upon
the
river
they
were
still
divided
in
the
same
way
in
seating
herself
she
had
been
very
anxious
not
to
disarrange
that
arrangement
almost
equally
anxious
not
to
seem
to
adhere
to
it
with
any
special
purpose
she
was
very
careful
that
there
should
be
nothing
seen
in
her
manner
that
was
in
any
way
special
but
in
the
meantime
she
was
suffering
an
agony
of
trouble
he
did
not
care
for
her
in
the
least
she
was
becoming
sure
of
that
she
had
given
all
her
love
to
a
man
who
had
none
to
give
her
in
return
as
she
thought
of
this
she
almost
longed
for
the
offer
of
that
which
she
knew
she
could
not
have
accepted
had
it
been
offered
to
her
but
she
talked
on
about
the
scenery
about
the
weather
descanting
on
the
pleasure
of
living
where
such
loveliness
was
within
reach
then
there
came
a
pause
for
a
moment
nora
said
priscilla
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
thinking
about
but
it
is
not
of
the
beauty
of
niddon
park
then
there
came
a
faint
sound
as
of
an
hysterical
sob
and
then
a
gurgle
in
the
throat
and
then
a
pretence
at
laughter
i
do
believe
i
am
thinking
of
anything
at
all
said
nora
after
which
hugh
insisted
on
descending
to
the
bank
of
the
river
but
as
the
necessity
of
the
slope
was
quite
manifest
none
of
the
girls
would
go
with
him
come
miss
rowley
said
he
will
you
not
show
them
that
a
lady
can
go
up
and
down
a
hill
as
well
as
a
man
i
had
rather
not
go
up
and
down
the
hill
said
she
then
he
understood
that
she
was
angry
with
him
and
in
some
sort
surmised
the
cause
of
her
anger
not
that
he
believed
that
she
loved
him
but
it
seemed
possible
to
him
that
she
resented
the
absence
of
his
attention
he
went
down
and
scrambled
out
on
the
rocks
into
the
bed
of
the
river
while
the
girls
above
looked
down
upon
him
watching
the
leaps
that
he
made
priscilla
and
trevelyan
called
to
him
bidding
him
beware
but
nora
called
not
at
all
he
was
whistling
as
he
made
his
jumps
but
still
he
heard
their
voices
and
knew
that
he
did
not
hear
nora
voice
he
poised
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
looked
up
the
river
and
down
the
river
turning
himself
carefully
on
his
narrow
foothold
but
he
was
thinking
only
of
nora
could
there
be
anything
nobler
than
to
struggle
on
with
her
if
she
only
would
be
willing
but
then
she
was
young
and
should
she
yield
to
such
a
request
from
him
she
would
not
know
what
she
was
yielding
he
turned
again
jumping
from
rock
to
rock
till
he
reached
the
bank
and
then
made
his
way
again
up
to
the
withered
oak
you
would
not
have
repented
it
if
you
had
come
down
with
me
he
said
to
nora
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
she
answered
when
they
started
to
return
she
stepped
on
gallantly
with
priscilla
but
priscilla
was
stopped
by
some
chance
having
some
word
to
say
to
her
brother
having
some
other
word
to
say
to
trevelyan
could
it
be
that
her
austerity
had
been
softened
and
that
in
kindness
she
contrived
that
nora
should
be
left
some
yards
behind
them
with
her
brother
whether
it
were
kindness
or
an
unkind
error
so
it
was
nora
when
she
perceived
what
destiny
was
doing
for
her
would
not
interfere
with
destiny
if
he
chose
to
speak
to
her
she
would
hear
him
and
would
answer
him
she
knew
very
well
what
answer
she
would
give
him
she
had
her
answer
quite
ready
at
her
fingers
ends
there
was
no
doubt
about
her
answer
they
had
walked
half
a
mile
together
and
he
had
spoken
of
nothing
but
the
scenery
she
had
endeavoured
to
appear
to
be
excited
oh
yes
the
scenery
of
devonshire
was
delightful
she
hardly
wanted
anything
more
to
make
her
happy
if
only
this
misery
respecting
her
sister
could
be
set
right
and
you
you
yourself
said
he
do
you
mean
that
there
is
nothing
you
want
in
leaving
london
not
much
indeed
it
sometimes
seemed
to
me
that
that
kind
of
life
was
was
very
pleasant
to
you
what
kind
of
life
mr
stanbury
the
life
that
you
were
living
going
out
being
admired
and
having
the
rich
and
dainty
all
around
you
i
do
dislike
people
because
they
are
rich
she
said
no
nor
do
i
and
i
despise
those
who
affect
to
dislike
them
but
all
can
not
be
rich
nor
all
dainty
as
you
choose
to
call
them
but
they
who
have
once
been
dainty
as
i
call
them
never
like
to
divest
themselves
of
their
daintiness
you
have
been
one
of
the
dainty
miss
rowley
have
i
certainly
i
doubt
whether
you
would
be
happy
if
you
thought
that
your
daintiness
had
departed
from
you
i
hope
stanbury
that
nothing
nice
and
pleasant
has
departed
from
me
if
i
have
ever
been
dainty
dainty
i
hope
i
may
remain
i
will
never
at
any
rate
give
it
up
of
my
own
accord
why
she
said
this
she
could
never
explain
to
herself
she
had
certainly
not
intended
to
rebuff
him
when
she
had
been
saying
it
but
he
spoke
not
a
word
to
her
further
as
they
walked
home
either
of
her
mode
of
life
or
of
his
own
chapter

hugh
stanbury
smokes
his
pipe
illustration
nora
rowley
when
she
went
to
bed
after
her
walk
to
niddon
park
in
company
with
hugh
stanbury
was
full
of
wrath
against
him
but
she
could
not
own
her
anger
to
herself
nor
could
she
even
confess
to
herself
though
she
was
breaking
her
heart
that
there
really
existed
for
her
the
slightest
cause
of
grief
but
why
had
he
been
so
stern
to
her
why
had
he
gone
out
of
his
way
to
be
uncivil
to
her
he
had
called
her
dainty
meaning
to
imply
by
the
epithet
that
she
was
one
of
the
butterflies
of
the
day
caring
for
nothing
but
sunshine
and
an
opportunity
of
fluttering
her
silly
wings
she
had
understood
well
what
he
meant
of
course
he
was
right
to
be
cold
to
her
if
his
heart
was
cold
but
he
need
not
have
insulted
her
by
his
rebukes
had
he
been
kind
to
her
he
might
have
rebuked
her
as
much
as
he
liked
she
quite
appreciated
the
delightful
intimacy
of
a
loving
word
of
counsel
from
the
man
she
loved
how
nice
it
is
as
it
were
to
play
at
marriage
and
to
hear
beforehand
something
of
the
pleasant
weight
of
gentle
marital
authority
but
there
had
been
nothing
of
that
in
his
manner
to
her
he
had
told
her
that
she
was
dainty
and
had
so
told
it
her
as
she
thought
that
she
might
learn
thereby
that
under
no
circumstances
would
he
have
any
other
tale
to
tell
her
if
he
had
no
other
tale
why
had
he
not
been
silent
did
he
think
that
she
was
subject
to
his
rebuke
merely
because
she
lived
under
his
mother
roof
she
would
soon
shew
him
that
her
residence
at
the
clock
house
gave
him
no
such
authority
over
her
then
amidst
her
wrath
and
despair
she
cried
herself
asleep
while
she
was
sobbing
in
bed
he
was
sitting
with
a
short
black
pipe
stuck
into
his
mouth
on
the
corner
of
the
churchyard
wall
opposite
before
he
had
left
the
house
he
and
priscilla
had
spoken
together
for
some
minutes
about
trevelyan
of
course
she
was
wrong
to
see
him
said
priscilla
i
hesitate
to
wound
her
by
so
saying
because
she
has
been
though
i
did
tell
her
so
when
she
asked
me
she
could
have
lost
nothing
by
declining
his
visit
the
worst
of
it
is
that
trevelyan
swears
that
he
will
never
receive
her
again
if
she
received
him
he
must
unswear
it
said
priscilla
that
is
all
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
a
man
should
take
a
girl
from
her
home
and
make
her
his
wife
and
then
throw
her
off
for
so
little
of
an
offence
as
this
she
might
compel
him
by
law
to
take
her
back
what
would
she
get
by
that
little
enough
said
priscilla
and
it
was
little
enough
she
got
by
marrying
him
she
would
have
had
bread
and
meat
and
raiment
without
being
married
i
suppose
but
it
was
a
yes
and
now
she
is
at
nuncombe
putney
and
he
is
roaming
about
in
london
he
has
to
pay
ever
so
much
a
year
for
his
and
she
is
crushed
into
nothing
by
it
how
long
will
she
have
to
remain
here
hugh
how
can
i
say
i
suppose
there
is
no
reason
against
her
remaining
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
for
me
personally
none
were
she
much
worse
than
i
think
she
is
i
should
not
care
in
the
least
for
myself
if
i
thought
that
we
were
doing
her
good
helping
to
bring
her
back
she
ca
hurt
me
i
am
so
fixed
and
dry
and
established
that
nothing
anybody
says
will
affect
me
but
mamma
does
like
it
what
is
it
she
dislikes
the
idea
that
she
is
harbouring
a
married
woman
of
whom
people
say
at
least
that
she
has
a
lover
is
she
to
be
turned
out
because
people
are
slanderers
why
should
mamma
suffer
because
this
woman
who
is
a
stranger
to
her
has
been
imprudent
if
she
were
your
wife
hugh
god
forbid
if
we
were
in
any
way
bound
to
her
of
course
we
would
do
our
duty
but
if
it
makes
mamma
unhappy
i
am
sure
you
will
not
press
it
i
think
merton
has
spoken
to
her
and
then
aunt
stanbury
has
written
such
letters
who
cares
for
aunt
jemima
everybody
cares
for
her
except
you
and
i
and
now
this
man
who
has
been
here
asking
the
servant
questions
has
upset
her
greatly
even
your
coming
has
done
so
knowing
as
she
does
that
you
have
come
not
to
see
us
but
to
make
inquiries
about
trevelyan
she
is
so
annoyed
by
it
that
she
does
not
sleep
do
you
wish
her
to
be
taken
away
at
once
asked
hugh
almost
in
an
angry
tone
certainly
not
that
would
be
impossible
we
have
agreed
to
take
her
and
must
bear
with
it
and
i
would
not
have
her
moved
from
this
if
i
thought
that
if
she
stayed
awhile
it
might
be
arranged
that
she
might
return
from
us
direct
to
her
husband
i
shall
try
that
of
course
now
but
if
he
will
not
have
her
if
he
be
so
obstinate
so
foolish
and
so
wicked
do
not
leave
her
here
longer
than
you
can
help
then
hugh
explained
that
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
were
to
be
in
england
in
the
spring
and
that
it
would
be
very
desirable
that
the
poor
woman
should
not
be
sent
abroad
to
look
for
a
home
before
that
if
it
must
be
so
it
must
said
priscilla
but
eight
months
is
a
long
time
hugh
went
out
to
smoke
his
pipe
on
the
in
a
moody
unhappy
state
of
mind
he
had
hoped
to
have
done
so
well
in
regard
to
trevelyan
till
he
had
met
colonel
osborne
he
felt
sure
almost
sure
that
she
would
have
refused
to
see
that
pernicious
troubler
of
the
peace
of
families
in
this
he
found
that
he
had
been
disappointed
but
he
had
not
expected
that
priscilla
would
have
been
so
much
opposed
to
the
arrangement
which
he
had
made
about
the
house
and
then
he
had
been
buoyed
up
by
the
anticipation
of
some
delight
in
meeting
nora
rowley
there
was
at
any
rate
the
excitement
of
seeing
her
to
keep
his
spirits
from
flagging
he
had
seen
her
and
had
had
the
opportunity
of
which
he
had
so
long
been
thinking
he
had
seen
her
and
had
had
every
possible
advantage
on
his
side
what
could
any
man
desire
better
than
the
privilege
of
walking
home
with
the
girl
he
loved
through
country
lanes
of
a
summer
evening
they
had
been
an
hour
together
or
might
have
been
had
he
chosen
to
prolong
the
interview
but
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
between
them
had
had
not
the
slightest
interest
unless
it
were
that
they
had
tended
to
make
the
interval
between
him
and
her
wider
than
ever
he
had
asked
her
he
thought
that
he
had
asked
whether
it
would
grieve
her
to
abandon
that
delicate
dainty
mode
of
life
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
and
she
had
replied
that
she
would
never
abandon
it
of
her
own
accord
of
course
she
had
intended
him
to
take
her
at
her
word
he
blew
forth
quick
clouds
of
heavy
smoke
as
he
attempted
to
make
himself
believe
that
this
was
all
for
the
best
what
would
such
a
one
as
he
was
do
with
a
wife
or
seeing
as
he
did
see
that
marriage
itself
was
quite
out
of
the
question
how
could
it
be
good
either
for
him
or
her
that
they
should
be
tied
together
by
a
long
engagement
such
a
future
would
not
at
all
suit
the
purpose
of
his
life
in
his
life
absolute
freedom
would
be
needed
freedom
from
unnecessary
ties
freedom
from
unnecessary
burdens
his
income
was
most
precarious
and
he
certainly
would
not
make
it
less
so
by
submission
to
any
closer
literary
thraldom
and
he
believed
himself
to
be
a
bohemian
too
much
of
a
bohemian
to
enjoy
a
domestic
fireside
with
children
and
slippers
to
be
free
to
go
where
he
liked
and
when
he
liked
to
think
as
he
pleased
to
be
driven
nowhere
by
conventional
rules
to
use
his
days
sundays
as
well
as
mondays
as
he
pleased
to
use
them
to
turn
republican
if
his
mind
should
take
him
that
way
or
quaker
or
mormon
or
red
indian
if
he
wished
it
and
in
so
turning
to
do
no
damage
to
any
one
but
himself
that
was
the
life
which
he
had
planned
for
himself
his
aunt
stanbury
had
not
read
his
character
altogether
wrongly
as
he
thought
when
she
had
once
declared
that
decency
and
godliness
were
both
distasteful
to
him
would
it
not
be
destruction
to
such
a
one
as
he
was
to
fall
into
an
interminable
engagement
with
any
girl
let
her
be
ever
so
sweet
but
yet
he
felt
as
he
sat
there
filling
pipe
after
pipe
smoking
away
till
past
midnight
that
though
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
trammels
though
he
was
totally
unfit
for
matrimony
either
present
or
in
prospect
he
felt
that
he
had
within
his
breast
a
double
identity
and
that
that
other
division
of
himself
would
be
utterly
crushed
if
it
were
driven
to
divest
itself
of
the
idea
of
love
whence
was
to
come
his
poetry
the
romance
of
his
life
the
springs
of
clear
water
in
which
his
ignoble
thoughts
were
to
be
dipped
till
they
should
become
pure
if
love
was
to
be
banished
altogether
from
the
list
of
delights
that
were
possible
to
him
and
then
he
began
to
speculate
on
love
that
love
of
which
poets
wrote
and
of
which
he
found
that
some
sparkle
was
necessary
to
give
light
to
his
life
was
it
not
the
one
particle
of
divine
breath
given
to
man
of
which
he
had
heard
since
he
was
a
boy
and
how
was
this
love
to
be
come
at
and
was
it
to
be
a
thing
of
reality
or
merely
an
idea
was
it
a
pleasure
to
be
attained
or
a
mystery
that
charmed
by
the
difficulties
of
the
distance
a
distance
that
never
could
be
so
passed
that
the
thing
should
really
be
reached
was
love
to
be
ever
a
delight
vague
as
is
that
feeling
of
unattainable
beauty
which
mountains
give
when
you
know
that
you
can
never
place
yourself
amidst
their
unseen
valleys
and
if
love
could
be
reached
the
love
of
which
the
poets
sing
and
of
which
his
own
heart
was
ever
singing
what
were
to
be
its
pleasures
to
press
a
hand
to
kiss
a
lip
to
clasp
a
waist
to
hear
even
the
low
voice
of
the
vanquished
confessing
loved
one
as
she
hides
her
blushing
cheek
upon
your
shoulder
what
is
it
all
but
to
have
reached
the
once
mysterious
valley
of
your
mountain
and
to
have
found
that
it
is
as
other
valleys
rocks
and
stones
with
a
little
grass
and
a
thin
stream
of
running
water
but
beyond
that
pressure
of
the
hand
and
that
kissing
of
the
lips
beyond
that
pressure
of
the
plumage
which
is
common
to
birds
and
men
what
could
love
do
beyond
that
there
were
children
with
dirty
faces
and
household
bills
and
a
wife
who
must
perhaps
always
darn
the
stockings
and
be
sometimes
cross
was
love
to
lead
only
to
this
a
dull
life
with
a
woman
who
had
lost
the
beauty
from
her
cheeks
and
the
gloss
from
her
hair
and
the
music
from
her
voice
and
the
fire
from
her
eye
and
the
grace
from
her
step
and
whose
waist
an
arm
should
no
longer
be
able
to
span
did
the
love
of
the
poets
lead
to
that
and
that
only
then
through
the
cloud
of
smoke
there
came
upon
him
some
dim
idea
of
that
the
mysterious
valley
among
the
mountains
the
prospect
of
which
was
so
charming
to
him
which
made
the
poetry
of
his
life
was
in
fact
the
capacity
of
caring
more
for
other
human
beings
than
for
himself
the
beauty
of
it
all
was
not
so
much
in
the
thing
loved
as
in
the
loving
were
she
a
cripple
hunchbacked
eyeless
he
said
to
himself
it
might
be
the
same
only
she
must
be
a
woman
then
he
blew
off
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
and
went
into
bed
lost
amidst
poetry
philosophy
love
and
tobacco
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
was
to
start
the
next
morning
at
seven
and
priscilla
had
promised
to
give
him
his
breakfast
before
he
went
priscilla
of
course
kept
her
word
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
would
take
a
grim
pleasure
in
coming
down
to
make
the
tea
at
any
possible
hour
at
five
at
four
if
it
were
needed
and
who
would
never
want
to
go
to
bed
again
when
the
ceremony
was
performed
but
when
nora
made
her
appearance
nora
who
had
been
called
dainty
both
priscilla
and
hugh
were
surprised
they
could
not
say
why
she
was
there
nor
could
nora
tell
herself
she
had
not
forgiven
him
she
had
no
thought
of
being
gentle
and
loving
to
him
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
had
no
wish
of
saying
to
him
once
again
but
yet
she
was
in
the
room
waiting
for
him
when
he
came
down
to
his
breakfast
she
had
been
unable
to
sleep
and
had
reasoned
with
herself
as
to
the
absurdity
of
lying
in
bed
awake
when
she
preferred
to
be
up
and
out
of
the
house
it
was
true
that
she
had
not
been
out
of
her
bed
at
seven
any
morning
since
she
had
been
at
nuncombe
putney
but
that
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
more
active
on
this
special
morning
there
was
a
noise
in
the
house
and
she
never
could
sleep
when
there
was
a
noise
she
was
quite
sure
that
she
was
not
going
down
because
she
wished
to
see
hugh
stanbury
but
she
was
equally
sure
that
it
would
be
a
disgrace
to
her
to
be
deterred
from
going
down
simply
because
the
man
was
there
so
she
descended
to
the
parlour
and
was
standing
near
the
open
window
when
stanbury
bustled
into
the
room
some
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
proper
time
priscilla
was
there
also
guessing
something
of
the
truth
and
speculating
whether
these
two
young
people
should
they
love
each
other
would
be
the
better
or
the
worse
for
such
love
there
must
be
marriages
if
only
that
the
world
might
go
on
in
accordance
with
the
creator
purpose
but
as
far
as
priscilla
could
see
blessed
were
they
who
were
not
called
upon
to
assist
in
the
scheme
to
her
eyes
all
days
seemed
to
be
days
of
wrath
and
all
times
times
of
tribulation
and
it
was
all
mere
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
to
go
on
and
bear
it
till
one
was
dead
helping
others
to
bear
it
if
such
help
might
be
of
avail
that
was
her
theory
of
life
to
make
it
pleasant
by
eating
and
drinking
and
dancing
or
even
by
falling
in
love
was
to
her
mind
a
vain
crunching
of
ashes
between
the
teeth
not
to
have
ill
things
said
of
her
and
of
hers
not
to
be
disgraced
not
to
be
rendered
incapable
of
some
human
effort
not
to
have
actually
to
starve
such
was
the
extent
of
her
ambition
in
this
world
and
for
the
next
she
felt
so
assured
of
the
goodness
of
god
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
doubt
of
happiness
in
a
world
that
was
to
be
eternal
her
doubt
was
this
whether
it
was
really
the
next
world
which
would
be
eternal
of
eternity
she
did
not
doubt
but
might
there
not
be
many
worlds
these
things
however
she
kept
almost
entirely
to
herself
you
down
priscilla
had
said
well
yes
i
could
not
sleep
when
i
heard
you
all
moving
and
the
morning
is
so
fine
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
go
out
and
walk
after
your
brother
has
gone
priscilla
promised
that
she
would
walk
and
then
the
tea
was
made
your
sister
and
i
are
going
out
for
an
early
walk
said
nora
when
she
was
greeted
by
stanbury
priscilla
said
nothing
but
thought
she
understood
it
all
i
wish
i
were
going
with
you
said
hugh
nora
remembering
how
very
little
he
had
made
of
his
opportunity
on
the
evening
before
did
not
believe
him
the
eggs
and
fried
bacon
were
eaten
in
a
hurry
and
very
little
was
said
then
there
came
the
moment
for
parting
the
brother
and
sister
kissed
each
other
and
hugh
took
nora
by
the
hand
i
hope
you
make
yourself
happy
here
he
said
oh
yes
if
it
were
only
for
myself
i
should
want
nothing
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
with
trevelyan
the
best
will
be
to
make
him
and
every
one
understand
that
the
fault
is
altogether
his
and
not
emily
the
best
will
be
to
make
each
think
that
there
has
been
no
real
fault
said
hugh
there
should
be
no
talking
of
faults
said
priscilla
let
the
husband
take
his
wife
back
as
he
is
bound
to
do
these
words
occupied
hardly
a
minute
in
the
saying
but
during
that
minute
hugh
stanbury
held
nora
by
the
hand
he
held
it
fast
she
would
not
attempt
to
withdraw
it
but
neither
would
she
return
his
pressure
by
the
muscle
of
a
single
finger
what
right
had
he
to
press
her
hand
or
to
make
any
sign
of
love
any
pretence
of
loving
when
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
tell
her
that
she
was
not
good
enough
for
him
then
he
started
and
nora
and
priscilla
put
on
their
hats
and
left
the
house
let
us
go
to
niddon
park
said
nora
to
niddon
park
again
yes
it
is
so
beautiful
and
i
should
like
to
see
it
by
the
morning
light
there
is
plenty
of
time
so
they
walked
to
niddon
park
in
the
morning
as
they
had
done
on
the
preceding
evening
their
conversation
at
first
regarded
trevelyan
and
his
wife
and
the
old
trouble
but
nora
could
not
keep
herself
from
speaking
of
hugh
stanbury
he
would
not
have
come
she
said
unless
louis
had
sent
him
he
would
not
have
come
now
i
think
of
course
not
why
should
he
before
parliament
was
hardly
over
too
but
he
wo
remain
in
town
now
will
he
he
says
somebody
must
remain
and
i
think
he
will
be
in
london
till
near
christmas
how
disagreeable
but
i
suppose
he
does
care
it
all
the
same
to
a
man
like
him
they
do
shut
the
clubs
up
i
dare
say
will
he
come
here
at
christmas
either
then
or
for
the
new
year
just
for
a
day
or
two
we
shall
be
gone
then
i
suppose
said
nora
that
must
depend
on
trevelyan
said
priscilla
what
a
life
for
two
women
to
lead
to
depend
upon
the
caprice
of
a
man
who
must
be
mad
do
you
think
that
trevelyan
will
care
for
what
your
brother
says
to
him
i
do
not
know
mr
trevelyan
he
is
very
fond
of
your
brother
and
i
suppose
men
friends
do
listen
to
each
other
they
never
seem
to
listen
to
women
do
you
think
that
after
all
they
despise
women
they
look
on
them
as
dainty
foolish
things
sometimes
women
despise
men
said
priscilla
not
very
often
do
they
and
then
women
are
so
dependent
on
men
a
woman
can
get
nothing
without
a
man
i
manage
to
get
on
somehow
said
priscilla
no
you
do
miss
stanbury
if
you
think
of
it
you
want
mutton
and
who
kills
the
sheep
but
who
cooks
it
but
the
are
the
best
said
nora
and
the
and
the
men
to
wait
at
table
and
the
and
the
and
the
all
the
things
that
women
do
men
do
better
there
are
two
things
they
ca
do
said
priscilla
what
are
they
they
ca
suckle
babies
and
they
ca
forget
themselves
about
the
babies
of
course
not
as
for
forgetting
themselves
i
am
not
quite
so
sure
that
i
can
forget
that
is
just
where
your
brother
went
down
last
night
they
had
at
this
moment
reached
the
top
of
the
steep
slope
below
which
the
river
ran
brawling
among
the
rocks
and
nora
seated
herself
exactly
where
she
had
sat
on
the
previous
evening
i
have
been
down
scores
of
times
said
priscilla
let
us
go
now
you
would
go
when
hugh
asked
you
yesterday
i
did
care
then
but
do
come
now
if
you
do
mind
the
climb
then
they
went
down
the
slope
and
reached
the
spot
from
whence
hugh
stanbury
had
jumped
from
rock
to
rock
across
the
stream
you
have
never
been
out
there
have
you
said
nora
on
the
rocks
oh
dear
no
i
should
be
sure
to
fall
but
he
went
just
like
a
goat
that
one
of
the
things
that
men
can
do
i
suppose
said
priscilla
but
i
do
see
any
great
glory
in
being
like
a
goat
i
do
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
go
and
i
think
i
try
it
is
so
mean
to
be
dainty
and
weak
i
do
think
it
at
all
dainty
to
keep
dry
feet
but
he
did
get
his
feet
wet
said
nora
or
if
he
did
he
mind
i
can
see
at
once
that
i
should
be
giddy
and
tumble
down
if
i
tried
it
of
course
you
would
but
he
did
tumble
down
he
has
been
doing
it
all
his
life
said
priscilla
he
ca
do
it
up
in
london
when
i
think
of
myself
miss
stanbury
i
am
so
ashamed
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
do
i
could
write
an
article
for
a
newspaper
i
think
i
could
but
i
fear
no
one
would
read
it
they
read
his
said
nora
or
else
he
would
be
paid
for
writing
them
then
they
climbed
back
again
up
the
hill
and
during
the
climbing
there
were
no
words
spoken
the
slope
was
not
much
of
a
hill
was
no
more
than
the
fall
from
the
low
ground
of
the
valley
to
the
course
which
the
river
had
cut
for
itself
but
it
was
steep
while
it
lasted
and
both
the
young
women
were
forced
to
pause
for
a
minute
before
they
could
proceed
upon
their
journey
as
they
walked
home
priscilla
spoke
of
the
scenery
and
of
the
country
and
of
the
nature
of
the
life
which
she
and
her
mother
and
sister
had
passed
at
nuncombe
putney
nora
said
but
little
till
they
were
just
entering
the
village
and
then
she
went
back
to
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
i
would
sooner
said
she
write
for
a
newspaper
than
do
anything
else
in
the
world
why
so
because
it
is
so
noble
to
teach
people
everything
and
then
a
man
who
writes
for
a
newspaper
must
know
so
many
things
himself
i
believe
there
are
women
who
do
it
but
very
few
one
or
two
have
done
it
i
know
go
and
tell
that
to
aunt
stanbury
and
hear
what
she
will
say
about
such
women
i
suppose
she
is
very
prejudiced
yes
she
is
but
she
is
a
clever
woman
i
am
inclined
to
think
women
had
better
not
write
for
newspapers
and
why
not
nora
asked
my
reasons
would
take
me
a
week
to
explain
and
i
doubt
whether
i
have
them
very
clear
in
my
own
head
in
the
first
place
there
is
that
difficulty
about
the
babies
most
of
them
must
get
married
you
know
but
not
all
said
nora
no
thank
god
not
all
and
if
you
are
not
married
you
might
write
for
a
newspaper
at
any
rate
if
i
were
you
i
should
be
very
proud
of
my
brother
aunt
stanbury
is
not
at
all
proud
of
her
nephew
said
priscilla
as
they
entered
the
house
chapter
xxvi
a
third
party
is
so
objectionable
hugh
stanbury
went
in
search
of
trevelyan
immediately
on
his
return
to
london
and
found
his
friend
at
his
rooms
in
lincoln
inn
i
have
executed
my
commission
said
hugh
endeavouring
to
speak
of
what
he
had
done
in
a
cheery
voice
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
stanbury
very
much
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
need
trouble
you
to
tell
me
anything
about
it
and
why
not
i
have
learned
it
all
from
that
man
what
man
from
bozzle
he
has
come
back
and
has
been
with
me
and
has
learned
everything
look
here
trevelyan
when
you
asked
me
to
go
down
to
devonshire
you
promised
me
that
there
should
be
nothing
more
about
bozzle
i
expect
you
to
put
that
rascal
and
all
that
he
has
told
you
out
of
your
head
altogether
you
are
bound
to
do
so
for
my
sake
and
you
will
be
very
wise
to
do
so
for
your
own
i
was
obliged
to
see
him
when
he
came
yes
and
to
pay
him
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
is
all
done
and
should
be
forgotten
i
ca
forget
it
is
it
true
or
untrue
that
he
found
that
man
down
there
is
it
true
or
untrue
that
my
wife
received
colonel
osborne
at
your
mother
house
is
it
true
or
untrue
that
colonel
osborne
went
down
there
with
the
express
object
of
seeing
her
is
it
true
or
untrue
that
they
had
corresponded
it
is
nonsense
to
bid
me
to
forget
all
this
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
forget
that
i
had
desired
her
neither
to
write
to
him
nor
to
see
him
if
i
understand
the
matter
said
trevelyan
you
are
incorrect
in
one
of
your
assertions
in
which
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
am
wrong
trevelyan
but
i
do
think
you
ever
did
tell
your
wife
not
to
see
this
man
or
not
to
write
to
him
i
never
told
her
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
not
in
so
many
words
it
is
my
belief
that
she
has
endeavoured
to
obey
implicitly
every
clear
instruction
that
you
have
given
her
you
are
wrong
absolutely
and
altogether
wrong
heaven
and
earth
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
now
after
all
that
has
taken
place
that
she
did
not
know
my
wishes
i
have
not
said
that
but
you
have
chosen
to
place
her
in
such
a
position
that
though
your
word
would
go
for
much
with
her
she
can
not
bring
herself
to
respect
your
wishes
and
you
call
that
being
dutiful
and
affectionate
i
call
it
human
and
reasonable
and
i
think
that
it
is
compatible
with
duty
and
affection
have
you
consulted
her
wishes
always
consult
them
now
then
and
bid
her
come
back
to
you
no
never
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
will
never
do
so
the
moment
she
is
away
from
me
this
man
goes
to
her
and
she
receives
him
she
must
have
known
that
she
was
wrong
and
you
must
know
it
i
do
not
think
that
she
is
half
so
wrong
as
you
yourself
said
stanbury
to
this
trevelyan
made
no
answer
and
they
both
remained
silent
some
minutes
stanbury
had
a
communication
to
make
before
he
went
but
it
was
one
which
he
wished
to
delay
as
long
as
there
was
a
chance
that
his
friend
heart
might
be
softened
one
which
he
need
not
make
if
trevelyan
would
consent
to
receive
his
wife
back
to
his
house
there
was
the
day
paper
lying
on
the
table
and
stanbury
had
taken
it
up
and
was
reading
it
or
pretending
to
read
it
i
will
tell
you
what
i
propose
to
do
said
trevelyan
well
it
is
best
both
for
her
and
for
me
that
we
should
be
apart
i
can
not
understand
how
you
can
be
so
mad
as
to
say
so
you
do
understand
what
i
feel
heaven
and
earth
to
have
a
man
coming
and
going
but
never
mind
you
do
not
see
it
and
nothing
will
make
you
see
it
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
i
certainly
do
not
see
it
i
do
not
believe
that
your
wife
cares
more
for
colonel
osborne
except
as
an
old
friend
of
her
father
than
she
does
for
the
fellow
that
sweeps
the
crossing
it
is
a
matter
in
which
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
what
i
think
very
well
now
if
you
have
freed
your
mind
i
will
tell
you
my
purpose
i
am
bound
to
do
so
because
your
people
are
concerned
in
it
i
shall
go
abroad
and
leave
her
in
england
certainly
she
will
be
safer
here
than
she
can
be
abroad
unless
she
should
choose
to
go
back
with
her
father
to
the
islands
and
take
the
boy
no
i
could
not
permit
that
what
i
intend
is
this
i
will
give
her
a
year
as
long
as
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
she
has
no
communication
whatever
either
by
word
of
mouth
or
by
letter
with
that
man
if
she
does
i
will
put
the
case
immediately
into
the
hands
of
my
lawyer
with
instructions
to
him
to
ascertain
from
counsel
what
severest
steps
i
can
take
how
i
hate
that
word
severe
when
applied
to
a
woman
i
dare
say
you
do
when
applied
to
another
man
wife
but
there
will
be
no
severity
in
my
first
proposition
as
for
the
child
if
i
approve
of
the
place
in
which
she
lives
as
i
do
at
present
he
shall
remain
with
her
for
nine
months
in
the
year
till
he
is
six
years
old
then
he
must
come
to
me
and
he
shall
come
to
me
altogether
if
she
sees
or
hears
from
that
man
i
believe
that
a
year
will
enable
her
to
live
with
all
comfort
under
your
roof
as
to
that
said
stanbury
slowly
i
suppose
i
had
better
tell
you
at
once
that
the
nuncombe
putney
arrangement
can
not
be
considered
as
permanent
why
not
because
my
mother
is
timid
and
nervous
and
altogether
unused
to
the
world
that
unfortunate
woman
is
to
be
sent
away
even
from
nuncombe
putney
understand
me
trevelyan
i
understand
you
i
understand
you
most
thoroughly
nor
do
i
wonder
at
it
in
the
least
do
not
suppose
that
i
am
angry
with
your
mother
or
with
you
or
with
your
sister
i
have
no
right
to
expect
that
they
should
keep
her
after
that
man
has
made
his
way
into
their
house
i
can
well
conceive
that
no
honest
lady
would
do
so
it
is
not
that
at
all
but
it
is
that
how
can
you
tell
me
that
it
is
and
yet
you
would
have
me
believe
that
i
am
not
disgraced
as
he
said
this
trevelyan
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
tearing
his
hair
with
his
hands
he
was
in
truth
a
wretched
man
from
whose
mind
all
expectation
of
happiness
was
banished
who
regarded
his
own
position
as
one
of
incurable
ignominy
looking
upon
himself
as
one
who
had
been
made
unfit
for
society
by
no
fault
of
his
own
what
was
he
to
do
with
the
wretched
woman
who
could
be
kept
from
the
evil
of
her
pernicious
vanity
by
no
gentle
custody
whom
no
most
distant
retirement
would
make
safe
from
the
effects
of
her
own
ignorance
folly
and
obstinacy
when
is
she
to
go
he
asked
in
a
low
sepulchral
tone
as
though
these
new
tidings
that
had
come
upon
him
had
been
fatal
laden
with
doom
and
finally
subversive
of
all
chance
even
of
tranquillity
when
you
and
she
may
please
that
is
all
very
well
but
let
me
know
the
truth
i
would
not
have
your
mother
house
contaminated
but
may
she
remain
there
for
a
week
stanbury
jumped
from
his
seat
with
an
oath
i
tell
you
what
it
is
trevelyan
if
you
speak
of
your
wife
in
that
way
i
will
not
listen
to
you
it
is
unmanly
and
untrue
to
say
that
her
presence
can
contaminate
any
house
that
is
very
fine
it
may
be
chivalrous
in
you
to
tell
me
on
her
behalf
that
i
am
a
liar
and
that
i
am
not
a
man
you
drive
me
to
it
but
what
am
i
to
think
when
you
are
forced
to
declare
that
this
unfortunate
woman
can
not
be
allowed
to
remain
at
your
house
a
house
which
has
been
especially
taken
with
reference
to
a
shelter
for
her
she
has
been
received
with
the
idea
that
she
would
be
discreet
she
has
been
indiscreet
past
belief
and
she
is
to
be
turned
out
most
deservedly
heaven
and
earth
where
shall
i
find
a
roof
for
her
head
trevelyan
as
he
said
this
was
walking
about
the
room
with
his
hands
stretched
up
towards
the
ceiling
and
as
his
friend
was
attempting
to
make
him
comprehend
that
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
any
one
to
banish
trevelyan
from
the
clock
house
at
least
for
some
months
to
come
not
even
till
after
christmas
unless
some
satisfactory
arrangement
could
be
sooner
made
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
by
the
boy
who
called
himself
a
clerk
and
who
acted
as
trevelyan
servant
in
the
chambers
and
a
third
person
was
shown
into
the
room
that
third
person
was
bozzle
as
no
name
was
given
stanbury
did
not
at
first
know
bozzle
but
he
had
not
had
his
eye
on
bozzle
for
half
a
minute
before
he
recognised
the
by
the
outward
attributes
and
signs
of
his
profession
oh
is
that
you
mr
bozzle
said
trevelyan
as
soon
as
the
great
man
had
made
his
bow
of
salutation
well
what
is
it
illustration
that
third
person
was
mr
bozzle
hugh
stanbury
i
think
said
bozzle
making
another
bow
to
the
young
barrister
that
my
name
said
stanbury
exactly
so
the
identity
is
one
as
i
could
prove
on
oath
in
any
court
in
england
you
was
on
the
railway
platform
at
exeter
on
saturday
when
we
was
waiting
for
the
express
was
you
now
mr
what
that
to
you
well
as
it
do
happen
it
is
something
to
me
and
if
you
was
asked
that
question
in
hany
court
in
england
or
before
even
one
of
the
metropolitan
bekes
you
would
deny
it
why
the
devil
should
i
deny
it
what
all
this
about
trevelyan
of
course
you
ca
deny
it
when
i
down
on
a
fact
i
am
down
on
it
nothing
else
would
do
in
my
profession
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
mr
bozzle
asked
trevelyan
well
i
have
just
a
word
about
your
journey
to
devonshire
well
in
a
way
it
is
about
my
journey
to
devonshire
it
all
along
of
the
same
job
mr
trewillian
you
can
speak
before
my
friend
here
said
trevelyan
bozzle
had
taken
a
great
dislike
to
hugh
stanbury
regarding
the
barrister
with
a
correct
instinct
as
one
who
was
engaged
for
the
time
in
the
same
service
with
himself
and
who
was
his
rival
in
that
service
when
thus
instigated
to
make
as
it
were
a
party
of
three
in
this
delicate
and
most
confidential
matter
and
to
take
his
rival
into
his
confidence
he
shook
his
head
slowly
and
looked
trevelyan
hard
in
the
face
stanbury
is
my
particular
friend
said
trevelyan
and
knows
well
the
circumstances
of
this
unfortunate
affair
you
can
say
anything
before
him
bozzle
shook
his
head
again
i
rayther
not
trewillian
said
he
indeed
i
rayther
not
it
something
very
particular
if
you
take
my
advice
said
stanbury
you
will
not
hear
him
yourself
that
your
advice
mr
asked
bozzle
yes
that
my
advice
i
never
have
anything
to
do
with
such
a
fellow
as
you
as
long
as
i
could
help
it
i
dare
say
not
i
dare
say
not
we
hexpensive
and
haccurate
neither
of
which
is
much
in
your
line
if
i
understand
about
it
rightly
bozzle
if
you
got
anything
to
tell
tell
it
said
trevelyan
angrily
a
third
party
is
so
objectionable
pleaded
bozzle
never
mind
that
is
my
affair
it
is
your
affair
trewillian
there
not
a
doubt
of
that
the
lady
is
your
wife
damnation
shouted
trevelyan
but
the
credit
sir
said
bozzle
the
credit
is
mine
and
here
is
has
been
down
a
interfering
with
me
and
doing
no
good
as
i
undertake
to
prove
by
evidence
before
the
affair
is
over
the
affair
is
over
said
stanbury
that
as
you
think
that
where
your
information
goes
to
mine
goes
a
little
beyond
that
i
means
as
you
can
know
nothing
about
i
irons
in
the
fire
what
you
as
ignorant
on
as
the
babe
as
is
born
no
doubt
you
have
bozzle
said
stanbury
i
has
and
now
if
it
be
that
i
must
speak
before
a
third
party
trewillian
i
ready
it
ai
that
i
no
ways
ashamed
i
done
my
duty
and
knows
how
to
do
it
and
let
a
counsel
be
ever
so
sharp
i
never
yet
was
so
but
what
i
could
stand
up
and
hold
my
own
the
colonel
trewillian
got
a
letter
from
your
lady
this
morning
i
do
believe
it
said
stanbury
sharply
very
likely
not
it
ai
in
my
power
to
say
anything
whatever
about
you
believing
or
not
believing
but
lady
has
wrote
the
letter
and
the
colonel
he
has
received
it
you
do
look
after
these
things
you
do
know
the
ways
of
but
it
my
business
the
lady
has
wrote
the
letter
and
the
colonel
why
he
has
received
it
trevelyan
had
become
white
with
rage
when
bozzle
first
mentioned
this
continued
correspondence
between
his
wife
and
colonel
osborne
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
the
policeman
information
and
he
regarded
stanbury
assertion
of
incredulity
as
being
simply
of
a
piece
with
his
general
obstinacy
in
the
matter
at
this
moment
he
began
to
regret
that
he
had
called
in
the
assistance
of
his
friend
and
that
he
had
not
left
the
affair
altogether
in
the
hands
of
that
much
more
satisfactory
but
still
more
painful
agent
bozzle
he
had
again
seated
himself
and
for
a
moment
or
two
remained
silent
on
his
chair
it
ai
my
fault
trewillian
continued
bozzle
if
this
little
matter
ought
never
to
have
been
mentioned
before
a
third
party
it
is
of
no
moment
said
trevelyan
in
a
low
voice
what
does
it
signify
who
knows
it
now
do
not
believe
it
trevelyan
said
stanbury
very
well
very
well
just
as
you
like
do
believe
it
only
it
true
and
it
my
business
to
find
them
things
out
my
business
and
i
finds
out
trewillian
can
do
as
he
likes
about
it
if
it
right
why
then
it
is
right
it
ai
for
me
to
say
nothing
about
that
but
there
the
fact
the
lady
she
has
wrote
another
letter
and
the
colonel
why
he
has
received
it
there
ai
nothing
wrong
about
the
if
i
was
to
say
what
was
inside
of
that
billydou
why
then
i
should
be
proving
what
i
know
and
when
it
came
to
standing
up
in
court
i
should
be
able
to
hold
my
own
but
as
for
the
letter
the
lady
wrote
it
and
the
colonel
he
received
it
that
will
do
bozzle
said
trevelyan
shall
i
call
again
mr
trewillian
no
yes
i
send
to
you
when
i
want
you
you
shall
hear
from
me
i
suppose
i
better
be
keeping
my
eyes
open
about
the
place
mr
trewillian
for
god
sake
trevelyan
do
not
have
anything
more
to
do
with
this
man
that
all
very
well
for
you
said
bozzle
the
lady
your
wife
can
you
imagine
anything
more
disgraceful
than
all
this
said
stanbury
nothing
nothing
nothing
answered
trevelyan
and
i
to
keep
stirring
and
be
on
the
move
again
suggested
bozzle
who
prudently
required
to
be
fortified
by
instructions
before
he
devoted
his
time
and
talents
even
to
so
agreeable
a
pursuit
as
that
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
you
shall
hear
from
me
said
trevelyan
very
well
very
well
i
wish
you
trewillian
yours
most
obedient
there
was
one
other
point
mr
trewillian
what
point
asked
trevelyan
angrily
if
the
lady
was
to
join
the
colonel
that
will
do
bozzle
said
trevelyan
again
jumping
up
from
his
chair
that
will
do
so
saying
he
opened
the
door
and
bozzle
with
a
bow
took
his
departure
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
how
am
i
to
save
her
said
the
wretched
husband
appealing
to
his
friend
stanbury
endeavoured
with
all
his
eloquence
to
prove
that
this
latter
piece
of
information
from
the
spy
must
be
incorrect
if
such
a
letter
had
been
written
by
trevelyan
to
colonel
osborne
it
must
have
been
done
while
he
stanbury
was
staying
at
the
clock
house
this
seemed
to
him
to
be
impossible
but
he
could
hardly
explain
why
it
should
be
impossible
she
had
written
to
the
man
before
and
had
received
him
when
he
came
to
nuncombe
putney
why
was
it
even
improbable
that
she
should
have
written
to
him
again
nevertheless
stanbury
felt
sure
that
she
had
sent
no
such
letter
i
think
i
understand
her
feelings
and
her
mind
said
he
and
if
so
any
such
correspondence
would
be
incompatible
with
her
previous
conduct
trevelyan
only
smiled
at
this
or
pretended
to
smile
he
would
not
discuss
the
question
but
believed
implicitly
what
bozzle
had
told
him
in
spite
of
all
stanbury
arguments
i
can
say
nothing
further
said
stanbury
no
my
dear
fellow
there
is
nothing
further
to
be
said
except
this
that
i
will
have
my
unfortunate
wife
removed
from
the
decent
protection
of
your
mother
roof
with
the
least
possible
delay
i
feel
that
i
owe
stanbury
the
deepest
apology
for
having
sent
such
an
inmate
to
trouble
her
repose
nonsense
that
is
what
i
feel
and
i
say
that
it
is
nonsense
if
you
had
never
sent
that
wretched
blackguard
down
to
fabricate
lies
at
nuncombe
putney
my
repose
would
have
been
all
right
as
it
is
trevelyan
can
remain
where
she
is
till
after
christmas
there
is
not
the
least
necessity
for
removing
her
at
once
i
only
meant
to
say
that
the
arrangement
should
not
be
regarded
as
altogether
permanent
i
must
go
to
my
work
now
stanbury
stanbury
paused
at
the
door
and
then
once
more
turned
round
i
suppose
it
is
of
no
use
my
saying
anything
further
but
i
wish
you
to
understand
fully
that
i
regard
your
wife
as
a
woman
much
and
i
think
you
are
punishing
her
and
yourself
too
with
a
cruel
severity
for
an
indiscretion
of
the
very
slightest
kind
chapter
xxvii
trevelyan
letter
to
his
wife
trevelyan
when
he
was
left
alone
sat
for
above
a
couple
of
hours
contemplating
the
misery
of
his
position
and
endeavouring
to
teach
himself
by
thinking
what
ought
to
be
his
future
conduct
it
never
occurred
to
him
during
these
thoughts
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
at
once
take
back
his
wife
either
as
a
matter
of
duty
or
of
welfare
for
himself
or
for
her
he
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
she
had
disgraced
him
and
though
this
feeling
of
disgrace
made
him
so
wretched
that
he
wished
that
he
were
dead
he
would
allow
himself
to
make
no
attempt
at
questioning
the
correctness
of
his
conviction
though
he
were
to
be
shipwrecked
for
ever
even
that
seemed
to
be
preferable
to
supposing
that
he
had
been
wrong
nevertheless
he
loved
his
wife
dearly
and
in
the
white
heat
of
his
anger
endeavoured
to
be
merciful
to
her
when
stanbury
accused
him
of
severity
he
would
not
condescend
to
defend
himself
but
he
told
himself
then
of
his
great
mercy
was
he
not
as
fond
of
his
own
boy
as
any
other
father
and
had
he
not
allowed
her
to
take
the
child
because
he
had
felt
that
a
mother
love
was
more
imperious
more
craving
in
its
nature
than
the
love
of
a
father
had
that
been
severe
and
had
he
not
resolved
to
allow
her
every
comfort
which
her
unfortunate
position
the
misfortune
of
her
position
would
allow
her
to
enjoy
she
had
come
to
him
without
a
shilling
and
yet
bad
as
her
treatment
of
him
had
been
he
was
willing
to
give
enough
not
only
to
support
her
but
her
sister
also
with
every
comfort
severe
no
that
at
least
was
an
undeserved
accusation
he
had
been
anything
but
severe
foolish
he
might
have
been
in
taking
a
wife
from
a
home
in
which
she
had
been
unable
to
learn
the
discretion
of
a
matron
too
trusting
he
had
been
and
too
generous
but
certainly
not
severe
but
of
course
as
he
said
to
himself
a
young
man
like
stanbury
would
take
the
part
of
a
woman
with
whose
sister
he
was
in
love
then
he
turned
his
thoughts
upon
bozzle
and
there
came
over
him
a
crushing
feeling
of
ignominy
shame
moral
dirt
and
utter
degradation
as
he
reconsidered
his
dealings
with
that
ingenious
gentleman
he
was
paying
a
rogue
to
watch
the
steps
of
a
man
whom
he
hated
to
pry
into
the
home
secrets
to
read
the
letters
to
bribe
the
servants
to
record
the
movements
of
this
rival
this
successful
rival
in
his
wife
affections
it
was
a
filthy
thing
and
yet
what
could
he
do
gentlemen
of
old
his
own
grandfather
or
his
father
would
have
taken
such
a
fellow
as
colonel
osborne
by
the
throat
and
have
caned
him
and
afterwards
would
have
shot
him
or
have
stood
to
be
shot
all
that
was
changed
now
but
it
was
not
his
fault
that
it
was
changed
he
was
willing
enough
to
risk
his
life
could
any
opportunity
of
risking
it
in
this
cause
be
obtained
for
him
but
were
he
to
cudgel
colonel
osborne
he
would
be
simply
arrested
and
he
would
then
be
told
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
foully
by
striking
a
man
old
enough
to
be
his
father
how
was
he
to
have
avoided
the
employment
of
some
such
man
as
bozzle
he
had
also
employed
a
gentleman
his
friend
stanbury
and
what
was
the
result
the
facts
were
not
altered
even
stanbury
did
not
attempt
to
deny
that
there
had
been
a
correspondence
and
that
there
had
been
a
visit
but
stanbury
was
so
blind
to
all
impropriety
or
pretended
such
blindness
that
he
defended
that
which
all
the
world
agreed
in
condemning
of
what
use
had
stanbury
been
to
him
he
had
wanted
facts
not
advice
stanbury
had
found
out
no
facts
for
him
but
bozzle
either
by
fair
means
or
foul
did
get
at
the
truth
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
bozzle
was
right
about
that
letter
written
only
yesterday
and
received
on
that
very
morning
his
wife
who
had
probably
been
complaining
of
her
wrongs
to
stanbury
must
have
retired
from
that
conversation
to
her
chamber
and
immediately
have
written
this
letter
to
her
lover
with
such
a
woman
as
that
what
can
be
done
in
these
days
otherwise
than
by
the
aid
of
such
a
one
as
bozzle
he
could
not
confine
his
wife
in
a
dungeon
he
could
not
save
himself
from
the
disgrace
of
her
misconduct
by
any
rigours
of
surveillance
on
his
own
part
as
wives
are
managed
he
could
not
forbid
to
her
the
use
of
the
could
not
hinder
her
from
seeing
this
hypocritical
scoundrel
who
carried
on
his
wickedness
under
the
false
guise
of
family
friendship
he
had
given
her
every
chance
to
amend
her
conduct
but
if
she
were
resolved
on
disobedience
he
had
no
means
of
enforcing
obedience
the
facts
however
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
know
and
now
what
should
he
do
how
should
he
go
to
work
to
make
her
understand
that
she
could
not
write
even
a
letter
without
his
knowing
it
and
that
if
she
did
either
write
to
the
man
or
see
him
he
would
immediately
take
the
child
from
her
and
provide
for
her
only
in
such
fashion
as
the
law
should
demand
from
him
for
himself
and
for
his
own
life
he
thought
that
he
had
determined
what
he
would
do
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
continue
to
live
in
london
he
was
ashamed
to
enter
a
club
he
had
hardly
a
friend
to
whom
it
was
not
an
agony
to
speak
they
who
knew
him
knew
also
of
his
disgrace
and
no
longer
asked
him
to
their
houses
for
days
past
he
had
eaten
alone
and
sat
alone
and
walked
alone
all
study
was
impossible
to
him
no
pursuit
was
open
to
him
he
spent
his
time
in
thinking
of
his
wife
and
of
the
disgrace
which
she
had
brought
upon
him
such
a
life
as
this
he
knew
was
unmanly
and
shameful
and
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
that
he
should
in
some
way
change
it
he
would
go
out
of
england
and
would
travel
if
only
he
could
so
dispose
of
his
wife
that
she
might
be
safe
from
any
possible
communication
with
colonel
osborne
if
that
could
be
effected
nothing
that
money
could
do
should
be
spared
for
her
if
that
could
not
be
effected
he
would
remain
at
home
and
crush
her
that
night
before
he
went
to
bed
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
wife
which
was
as
follows
dear
emily
i
have
learned
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
you
have
corresponded
with
colonel
osborne
since
you
have
been
at
nuncombe
putney
and
also
that
you
have
seen
him
there
this
has
been
done
in
direct
opposition
to
my
expressed
wishes
and
i
feel
myself
compelled
to
tell
you
that
such
conduct
is
disgraceful
to
you
and
disgracing
to
me
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
you
can
reconcile
to
yourself
so
flagrant
a
disobedience
of
my
instructions
and
so
perverse
a
disregard
to
the
opinion
of
the
world
at
large
but
i
do
not
write
now
for
the
sake
of
finding
fault
with
you
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
have
any
hope
that
i
can
do
so
with
good
effect
either
as
regards
your
credit
or
my
happiness
nevertheless
it
is
my
duty
to
protect
both
you
and
myself
from
further
shame
and
i
wish
to
tell
you
what
are
my
intentions
with
that
view
in
the
first
place
i
warn
you
that
i
keep
a
watch
on
you
the
doing
so
is
very
painful
to
me
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
you
can
not
see
colonel
osborne
or
write
to
him
without
my
knowing
it
i
pledge
you
my
word
that
in
either
case
that
is
if
you
correspond
with
him
or
see
him
i
will
at
once
take
our
boy
away
from
you
i
will
not
allow
him
to
remain
even
with
a
mother
who
shall
so
misconduct
herself
should
colonel
osborne
address
a
letter
to
you
i
desire
that
you
will
put
it
under
an
envelope
addressed
to
me
if
you
obey
my
commands
on
this
head
i
will
leave
our
boy
with
you
nine
months
out
of
every
year
till
he
shall
be
six
years
old
such
at
least
is
my
present
idea
though
i
will
not
positively
bind
myself
to
adhere
to
it
and
i
will
allow
you
per
year
for
your
own
maintenance
and
that
of
your
sister
i
am
greatly
grieved
to
find
from
my
friend
stanbury
that
your
conduct
in
reference
to
colonel
osborne
has
been
such
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
you
should
leave
stanbury
house
i
do
not
wonder
that
it
should
be
so
i
shall
immediately
seek
for
a
future
home
for
you
and
when
i
have
found
one
that
is
suitable
i
will
have
you
conveyed
to
it
i
must
now
further
explain
my
purposes
and
i
must
beg
you
to
remember
that
i
am
driven
to
do
so
by
your
direct
disobedience
to
my
expressed
wishes
should
there
be
any
further
communication
between
you
and
colonel
osborne
not
only
will
i
take
your
child
away
from
you
but
i
will
also
limit
the
allowance
to
be
made
to
you
to
a
bare
sustenance
in
such
case
i
shall
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
a
lawyer
and
shall
probably
feel
myself
driven
to
take
steps
towards
freeing
myself
from
a
connection
which
will
be
disgraceful
to
my
name
for
myself
i
shall
live
abroad
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
london
has
become
to
me
uninhabitable
and
all
english
pleasures
are
distasteful
yours
affectionately
louis
trevelyan
when
he
had
finished
this
he
read
it
twice
and
believed
that
he
had
written
if
not
an
affectionate
at
any
rate
a
considerate
letter
he
had
no
bounds
to
the
pity
which
he
felt
for
himself
in
reference
to
the
injury
which
was
being
done
to
him
and
he
thought
that
the
offers
which
he
was
making
both
in
respect
to
his
child
and
the
money
were
such
as
to
entitle
him
to
his
wife
warmest
gratitude
he
hardly
recognised
the
force
of
the
language
which
he
used
when
he
told
her
that
her
conduct
was
disgraceful
and
that
she
had
disgraced
his
name
he
was
quite
unable
to
look
at
the
whole
question
between
him
and
his
wife
from
her
point
of
view
he
conceived
it
possible
that
such
a
woman
as
his
wife
should
be
told
that
her
conduct
would
be
watched
and
that
she
should
be
threatened
with
the
divorce
court
with
an
effect
that
should
upon
the
whole
be
salutary
there
be
men
and
not
bad
men
either
and
men
neither
uneducated
or
unintelligent
or
irrational
in
ordinary
matters
who
seem
to
be
absolutely
unfitted
by
nature
to
have
the
custody
or
guardianship
of
others
a
woman
in
the
hands
of
such
a
man
can
hardly
save
herself
or
him
from
endless
trouble
it
may
be
that
between
such
a
one
and
his
wife
events
shall
flow
on
so
evenly
that
no
ruling
no
constraint
is
necessary
that
even
the
giving
of
advice
is
never
called
for
by
the
circumstances
of
the
day
if
the
man
be
happily
forced
to
labour
daily
for
his
living
till
he
be
weary
and
the
wife
be
laden
with
many
ordinary
cares
the
routine
of
life
may
run
on
without
storms
but
for
such
a
one
if
he
be
without
work
the
management
of
a
wife
will
be
a
task
full
of
peril
the
lesson
may
be
learned
at
last
he
may
after
years
come
to
perceive
how
much
and
how
little
of
guidance
the
partner
of
his
life
requires
at
his
hands
and
he
may
be
taught
how
that
guidance
should
be
given
but
in
the
learning
of
the
lesson
there
will
be
sorrow
and
gnashing
of
teeth
it
was
so
now
with
this
man
he
loved
his
wife
to
a
certain
extent
he
still
trusted
her
he
did
not
believe
that
she
would
be
faithless
to
him
after
the
fashion
of
women
who
are
faithless
altogether
but
he
was
jealous
of
authority
fearful
of
slights
afraid
of
the
world
and
utterly
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
a
woman
mind
he
carried
the
letter
with
him
in
his
pocket
throughout
the
next
morning
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
called
upon
lady
milborough
though
he
was
obstinately
bent
on
acting
in
accordance
with
his
own
views
yet
he
was
morbidly
desirous
of
discussing
the
grievousness
of
his
position
with
his
friends
he
went
to
lady
milborough
asking
for
her
advice
but
desirous
simply
of
being
encouraged
by
her
to
do
that
which
he
was
resolved
to
do
on
his
own
judgment
down
after
her
to
nuncombe
putney
said
lady
milborough
holding
up
both
her
hands
yes
he
has
been
there
and
she
has
been
weak
enough
to
see
him
my
dear
louis
take
her
to
naples
at
once
at
once
it
is
too
late
for
that
now
lady
milborough
too
late
oh
no
she
has
been
foolish
indiscreet
disobedient
what
you
will
of
that
kind
but
louis
do
send
her
away
do
send
your
young
wife
away
from
you
those
whom
god
has
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
i
can
not
consent
to
live
with
a
wife
with
whom
neither
my
wishes
nor
my
word
have
the
slightest
effect
i
may
believe
of
her
what
i
please
but
think
what
the
world
will
believe
i
can
not
disgrace
myself
by
living
with
a
woman
who
persists
in
holding
intercourse
with
a
man
whom
the
world
speaks
of
as
her
lover
take
her
to
naples
said
lady
milborough
with
all
the
energy
of
which
she
was
capable
i
can
take
her
nowhere
nor
will
i
see
her
till
she
has
given
proof
that
her
whole
conduct
towards
me
has
been
altered
i
have
written
a
letter
to
her
and
i
have
brought
it
will
you
excuse
me
if
i
ask
you
to
take
the
trouble
to
read
it
then
he
handed
lady
milborough
the
letter
which
she
read
very
slowly
and
with
much
care
i
do
think
i
would
would
would
would
what
demanded
trevelyan
do
you
think
that
what
you
say
is
a
little
just
a
little
prone
to
make
to
make
the
breach
perhaps
wider
no
lady
milborough
in
the
first
place
how
can
it
be
wider
you
might
take
her
back
you
know
and
then
if
you
could
only
get
to
naples
how
can
i
take
her
back
while
she
is
corresponding
with
this
man
she
would
correspond
with
him
at
naples
trevelyan
shook
his
head
and
became
cross
his
old
friend
would
not
at
all
do
as
old
friends
are
expected
to
do
when
called
upon
for
advice
i
think
said
he
that
what
i
have
proposed
is
both
just
and
generous
but
louis
why
should
there
be
any
separation
she
has
forced
it
upon
me
she
is
headstrong
and
will
not
be
ruled
but
this
about
disgracing
you
do
you
think
that
you
must
say
that
i
think
i
must
because
it
is
true
if
i
do
not
tell
her
the
truth
who
is
there
that
will
do
so
it
may
be
bitter
now
but
i
think
that
it
is
for
her
welfare
dear
dear
dear
i
want
nothing
for
myself
lady
milborough
i
am
sure
of
that
louis
my
whole
happiness
was
in
my
home
no
man
cared
less
for
going
out
than
i
did
my
child
and
my
wife
were
everything
to
me
i
suppose
that
i
was
ever
seen
at
a
club
in
the
evening
once
throughout
a
season
and
she
might
have
had
anything
that
she
liked
anything
it
is
hard
lady
milborough
is
it
not
lady
milborough
who
had
seen
the
angry
brow
did
not
dare
to
suggest
naples
again
but
yet
if
any
word
might
be
spoken
to
prevent
this
utter
wreck
of
a
home
how
good
a
thing
it
would
be
he
had
got
up
to
leave
her
but
she
stopped
him
by
holding
his
hand
for
better
for
worse
louis
remember
that
why
has
she
forgotten
it
she
is
flesh
of
your
flesh
bone
of
your
bone
and
for
the
sake
think
of
your
boy
louis
do
not
send
that
letter
sleep
on
it
louis
and
think
of
it
i
have
slept
on
it
there
is
no
promise
in
it
of
forgiveness
after
a
while
it
is
written
as
though
you
intended
that
she
should
never
come
back
to
you
that
shall
be
as
she
behaves
herself
but
tell
her
so
let
there
be
some
one
bright
spot
in
what
you
say
to
her
on
which
her
mind
may
fix
itself
if
she
be
not
altogether
hardened
that
letter
will
drive
her
to
despair
but
trevelyan
would
not
give
up
the
letter
nor
indicate
by
a
word
that
he
would
reconsider
the
question
of
its
propriety
he
escaped
as
soon
as
he
could
from
lady
milborough
room
and
almost
declared
as
he
did
so
that
he
would
never
enter
her
doors
again
she
had
utterly
failed
to
see
the
matter
in
the
proper
light
when
she
talked
of
naples
she
must
surely
have
been
unable
to
comprehend
the
extent
of
the
to
which
he
the
husband
had
been
subjected
how
was
it
possible
that
he
should
live
under
the
same
roof
with
a
wife
who
claimed
to
herself
the
right
of
receiving
visitors
of
whom
he
disapproved
a
visitor
a
gentleman
one
whom
the
world
called
her
lover
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
fist
as
he
thought
of
his
old
friend
ignorance
of
the
very
first
law
in
a
married
code
of
laws
but
yet
when
he
was
out
in
the
streets
he
did
not
post
his
letter
at
once
but
thought
of
it
throughout
the
whole
day
trying
to
prove
the
weight
of
every
phrase
that
he
had
used
once
or
twice
his
heart
almost
relented
once
he
had
the
letter
in
his
hand
that
he
might
tear
it
but
he
did
not
tear
it
he
put
it
back
into
his
pocket
and
thought
again
of
his
grievance
surely
it
was
his
first
duty
in
such
an
emergency
to
be
firm
it
was
certainly
a
wretched
life
that
he
was
leading
in
the
evening
he
went
all
alone
to
an
for
his
dinner
and
then
sitting
with
a
miserable
glass
of
sherry
before
him
he
again
read
and
the
epistle
which
he
had
written
every
harsh
word
that
it
contained
was
in
some
sort
pleasant
to
his
ear
she
had
hit
him
hard
and
should
he
not
hit
her
again
and
then
was
it
not
his
bounden
duty
to
let
her
know
the
truth
yes
it
was
his
duty
to
be
firm
so
he
went
out
and
posted
the
letter
chapter
xxviii
great
tribulation
illustration
trevelyan
letter
to
his
wife
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
among
them
at
nuncombe
putney
trevelyan
was
altogether
unable
to
keep
it
to
herself
indeed
she
made
no
attempt
at
doing
so
her
husband
had
told
her
that
she
was
to
be
banished
from
the
clock
house
because
her
present
hostess
was
unable
to
endure
her
misconduct
and
of
course
she
demanded
the
reasons
of
the
charge
that
was
thus
brought
against
her
when
she
first
read
the
letter
which
she
did
in
the
presence
of
her
sister
she
towered
in
her
passion
disgraced
him
i
have
never
disgraced
him
it
is
he
that
has
disgraced
me
correspondence
yes
he
shall
see
it
all
unjust
ignorant
foolish
man
he
does
not
remember
that
the
last
instructions
he
really
gave
me
were
to
bid
me
see
colonel
osborne
take
my
boy
away
yes
of
course
i
am
a
woman
and
must
suffer
i
will
write
to
colonel
osborne
and
will
tell
him
the
truth
and
will
send
my
letter
to
louis
he
shall
know
how
he
has
me
i
will
not
take
a
penny
of
his
money
not
a
penny
maintain
you
i
believe
he
thinks
that
we
are
beggars
leave
this
house
because
of
my
conduct
what
can
stanbury
have
said
what
can
any
of
them
have
said
i
will
demand
to
be
told
free
himself
from
the
connection
oh
nora
nora
that
it
should
come
to
this
that
i
should
be
thus
threatened
who
have
been
as
innocent
as
a
baby
if
it
were
not
for
my
child
i
think
that
i
should
destroy
myself
nora
said
what
she
could
to
comfort
her
sister
insisting
chiefly
on
the
promise
that
the
child
should
not
be
taken
away
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
husband
power
in
the
mind
of
either
of
them
and
though
as
regarded
herself
trevelyan
would
have
defied
her
husband
let
his
power
be
what
it
might
yet
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
was
in
some
degree
restrained
by
the
fear
that
she
would
find
herself
deprived
of
her
only
comfort
we
must
just
go
where
he
bids
us
till
papa
comes
said
nora
and
when
papa
is
here
what
help
will
there
be
then
he
will
not
let
me
go
back
to
the
islands
with
my
boy
for
myself
i
might
die
or
get
out
of
his
way
anywhere
i
can
see
that
priscilla
stanbury
is
right
when
she
says
that
no
woman
should
trust
herself
to
any
man
disgraced
that
i
should
live
to
be
told
by
my
husband
that
i
had
disgraced
him
by
a
lover
there
was
some
sort
of
agreement
made
between
the
two
sisters
as
to
the
manner
in
which
priscilla
should
be
interrogated
respecting
the
sentence
of
banishment
which
had
been
passed
they
both
agreed
that
it
would
be
useless
to
make
inquiry
of
stanbury
if
anything
had
really
been
said
to
justify
the
statement
made
in
letter
it
must
have
come
from
priscilla
and
have
reached
trevelyan
through
priscilla
brother
they
both
of
them
had
sufficiently
learned
the
ways
of
the
house
to
be
sure
that
stanbury
had
not
been
the
person
active
in
the
matter
they
went
down
therefore
together
and
found
priscilla
seated
at
her
desk
in
the
parlour
stanbury
was
also
in
the
room
and
it
had
been
presumed
between
the
sisters
that
the
interrogations
should
be
made
in
that
absence
but
trevelyan
was
too
hot
in
the
matter
for
restraint
and
she
at
once
opened
out
her
budget
of
grievance
i
have
a
letter
from
my
husband
she
said
and
then
paused
but
priscilla
seeing
from
the
fire
in
her
eyes
that
she
was
much
moved
made
no
reply
but
turned
to
listen
to
what
might
further
be
said
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
trouble
you
with
his
suspicions
continued
trevelyan
or
read
to
you
what
he
says
about
colonel
osborne
as
she
spoke
she
was
holding
her
husband
letter
open
in
her
hands
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
you
do
not
know
he
says
i
have
corresponded
with
him
so
i
have
and
he
shall
see
the
correspondence
he
says
that
colonel
osborne
visited
me
he
did
come
to
see
me
and
nora
as
any
other
old
man
might
have
done
said
nora
it
was
not
likely
that
i
should
openly
confess
myself
to
be
afraid
to
see
my
father
old
friend
but
the
truth
is
my
husband
does
not
know
what
a
woman
is
she
had
begun
by
declaring
that
she
would
not
trouble
her
friend
with
any
statement
of
her
husband
complaints
against
her
but
now
she
had
made
her
way
to
the
subject
and
could
hardly
refrain
herself
priscilla
understood
this
and
thought
that
it
would
be
wise
to
interrupt
her
by
a
word
that
might
bring
her
back
to
her
original
purpose
is
there
anything
said
she
which
we
can
do
to
help
you
to
help
me
no
god
only
can
help
me
but
louis
informs
me
that
i
am
to
be
turned
out
of
this
house
because
you
demand
that
we
should
go
who
says
that
exclaimed
stanbury
my
husband
listen
this
is
what
he
says
am
greatly
grieved
to
hear
from
my
friend
stanbury
that
your
conduct
in
reference
to
colonel
osborne
has
been
such
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
you
should
leave
stanbury
house
is
that
true
is
that
true
in
her
general
mode
of
carrying
herself
and
of
enduring
the
troubles
of
her
life
trevelyan
was
a
strong
woman
but
now
her
grief
was
too
much
for
her
and
she
burst
out
into
tears
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
woman
that
ever
was
born
she
sobbed
out
through
her
tears
i
never
said
that
you
were
to
go
said
stanbury
but
your
son
has
told
trevelyan
that
we
must
go
said
nora
who
felt
that
her
sense
of
injury
against
hugh
stanbury
was
greatly
increased
by
what
had
taken
place
to
her
mind
he
was
the
person
most
important
in
the
matter
why
had
he
desired
that
they
should
be
sent
away
from
the
clock
house
she
was
very
angry
with
him
and
declared
to
herself
that
she
hated
him
with
all
her
heart
for
this
man
she
had
sent
away
that
other
lover
a
lover
who
had
really
loved
her
and
she
had
even
confessed
that
it
was
so
there
is
a
misunderstanding
about
this
said
priscilla
it
must
be
with
your
brother
then
said
nora
i
think
not
said
priscilla
i
think
that
it
has
been
with
mr
trevelyan
then
she
went
on
to
explain
with
much
difficulty
but
still
with
a
slow
distinctness
that
was
peculiar
to
her
what
had
really
taken
place
we
have
endeavoured
she
said
to
show
you
my
mother
and
i
that
we
have
not
misjudged
you
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
i
told
my
brother
that
i
did
not
think
the
arrangement
a
good
one
quite
as
a
permanence
it
was
very
difficult
and
her
cheeks
were
red
as
she
spoke
and
her
lips
faltered
it
was
an
exquisite
pain
to
her
to
have
to
give
the
pain
which
her
words
would
convey
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
as
she
said
to
herself
more
than
once
at
the
time
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
said
so
blurted
out
stanbury
with
her
usual
weakness
no
mother
it
was
my
saying
in
discussing
what
was
best
for
us
all
with
hugh
i
told
him
what
i
have
just
now
explained
then
of
course
we
must
go
said
trevelyan
who
had
gulped
down
her
sobs
and
was
resolved
to
be
firm
to
give
way
to
no
more
tears
to
bear
all
without
sign
of
womanly
weakness
you
will
stay
with
us
till
your
father
comes
said
priscilla
of
course
you
will
said
stanbury
you
and
nora
we
have
got
to
be
such
friends
now
no
said
trevelyan
as
to
friendship
for
me
it
is
out
of
the
question
we
must
pack
up
nora
and
go
somewhere
heaven
knows
where
nora
was
now
sobbing
why
your
brother
should
want
to
turn
us
out
after
he
has
sent
us
here
my
brother
wants
nothing
of
the
kind
said
priscilla
your
sister
has
no
better
friend
than
my
brother
it
will
be
better
nora
to
discuss
the
matter
no
further
said
trevelyan
we
must
go
away
somewhere
and
the
sooner
the
better
to
be
an
unwelcome
guest
is
always
bad
but
to
be
unwelcome
for
such
a
reason
as
this
is
terrible
there
is
no
reason
said
stanbury
indeed
there
is
none
trevelyan
will
understand
us
better
when
she
is
less
excited
said
priscilla
i
am
not
surprised
that
she
should
be
indignant
now
i
can
only
say
again
that
we
hope
you
will
stay
with
us
till
sir
marmaduke
rowley
shall
be
in
england
that
is
not
what
your
brother
means
said
nora
nor
is
it
what
i
mean
said
trevelyan
nora
we
had
better
go
to
our
own
room
i
suppose
i
must
write
to
my
husband
indeed
of
course
i
must
that
i
may
send
him
the
correspondence
i
fear
i
can
not
walk
out
into
the
street
stanbury
and
make
you
quit
of
me
till
i
hear
from
him
and
if
i
were
to
go
to
an
inn
at
once
people
would
speak
evil
of
me
and
i
have
no
money
my
dear
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
said
stanbury
but
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
we
shall
be
gone
within
three
days
or
four
at
the
furthest
indeed
i
will
pledge
myself
not
to
remain
longer
than
that
even
though
i
should
have
to
go
to
the
neither
i
nor
my
sister
will
stay
in
any
family
to
contaminate
it
come
nora
and
so
speaking
she
sailed
out
of
the
room
and
her
sister
followed
her
why
did
you
say
anything
about
it
oh
dear
oh
dear
why
did
you
speak
to
hugh
see
what
you
have
done
i
am
sorry
that
i
did
speak
replied
priscilla
slowly
sorry
of
course
you
are
sorry
but
what
good
is
that
but
mother
i
do
not
think
that
i
was
wrong
i
feel
sure
that
the
real
fault
in
all
this
is
with
trevelyan
as
it
has
been
all
through
he
should
not
have
written
to
her
as
he
has
done
i
suppose
hugh
did
tell
him
no
doubt
and
i
told
hugh
but
not
after
the
fashion
in
which
he
has
told
her
i
blame
myself
mostly
for
this
that
we
ever
consented
to
come
to
this
house
we
had
no
business
here
who
is
to
pay
the
rent
hugh
insisted
upon
taking
it
yes
and
he
will
pay
the
rent
and
we
shall
be
a
drag
upon
him
as
though
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
have
a
wife
and
a
family
of
his
own
and
what
good
have
we
done
we
had
not
strength
enough
to
say
that
that
wicked
man
should
not
see
her
when
he
came
for
he
is
a
wicked
man
if
we
had
done
that
she
would
have
been
as
bad
then
as
she
is
now
mother
we
had
no
business
to
meddle
either
with
her
badness
or
her
goodness
what
had
we
to
do
with
the
wife
of
such
a
one
as
trevelyan
or
with
any
woman
who
was
separated
from
her
husband
it
was
hugh
who
thought
we
should
be
of
service
to
them
yes
and
i
do
not
blame
him
he
is
in
a
position
to
be
of
service
to
people
he
can
do
work
and
earn
money
and
has
a
right
to
think
and
to
speak
we
have
a
right
to
think
only
for
ourselves
and
we
should
not
have
yielded
to
him
how
are
we
to
get
back
again
out
of
this
house
to
our
cottage
they
are
pulling
the
cottage
down
priscilla
to
some
other
cottage
mother
do
you
not
feel
while
we
are
living
here
that
we
are
pretending
to
be
what
we
are
not
after
all
aunt
stanbury
was
right
though
it
was
not
her
business
to
meddle
with
us
we
should
never
have
come
here
that
poor
woman
now
regards
us
as
her
bitter
enemies
i
meant
to
do
for
the
best
said
stanbury
the
fault
was
mine
mother
but
you
meant
it
for
the
best
my
dear
meaning
for
the
best
is
trash
i
do
know
that
i
did
mean
it
for
the
best
while
we
were
at
the
cottage
we
paid
our
way
and
were
honest
what
is
it
people
say
of
us
now
they
ca
say
any
harm
they
say
that
we
are
paid
by
the
husband
to
keep
his
wife
and
paid
again
by
the
lover
to
betray
the
husband
priscilla
yes
it
is
shocking
enough
but
that
comes
of
people
going
out
of
their
proper
course
we
were
too
humble
and
low
to
have
a
right
to
take
any
part
in
such
a
matter
how
true
it
is
that
while
one
crouches
on
the
ground
one
can
never
fall
the
matter
was
discussed
in
the
clock
house
all
day
between
stanbury
and
priscilla
and
between
trevelyan
and
nora
in
their
rooms
and
in
the
garden
but
nothing
could
come
of
such
discussions
no
change
could
be
made
till
further
instructions
should
have
been
received
from
the
angry
husband
nor
could
any
kind
of
argument
be
even
invented
by
priscilla
which
might
be
efficacious
in
inducing
the
two
ladies
to
remain
at
the
clock
house
even
should
trevelyan
allow
them
to
do
so
they
all
felt
the
intolerable
injustice
as
it
appeared
to
them
of
their
subjection
to
the
caprice
of
an
unreasonable
and
man
but
to
all
of
them
it
seemed
plain
enough
that
in
this
matter
the
husband
must
exercise
his
own
will
at
any
rate
till
sir
marmaduke
should
be
in
england
there
were
many
difficulties
throughout
the
day
trevelyan
would
not
go
down
to
dinner
sending
word
that
she
was
ill
and
that
she
would
if
she
were
allowed
have
some
tea
in
her
own
room
and
nora
said
that
she
would
remain
with
her
sister
priscilla
went
to
them
more
than
once
and
late
in
the
evening
they
all
met
in
the
parlour
but
any
conversation
seemed
to
be
impossible
and
trevelyan
as
she
went
up
to
her
room
at
night
again
declared
that
she
would
rid
the
house
of
her
presence
as
soon
as
possible
one
thing
however
was
done
on
that
melancholy
day
trevelyan
wrote
to
her
husband
and
enclosed
colonel
osborne
letter
to
herself
and
a
copy
of
her
reply
the
reader
will
hardly
require
to
be
told
that
no
such
further
letter
had
been
written
by
her
as
that
of
which
bozzle
had
given
information
to
her
husband
men
whose
business
it
is
to
detect
hidden
and
secret
things
are
very
apt
to
detect
things
which
have
never
been
done
what
excuse
can
a
detective
make
even
to
himself
for
his
own
existence
if
he
can
detect
nothing
bozzle
was
an
man
who
gloried
in
detecting
and
who
in
the
special
spirit
of
his
trade
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
all
around
him
were
things
secret
and
hidden
which
would
be
within
his
power
of
unravelling
if
only
the
slightest
clue
were
put
in
his
hand
he
lived
by
the
crookednesses
of
people
and
therefore
was
convinced
that
straight
doings
in
the
world
were
quite
exceptional
things
dark
and
dishonest
fights
fought
and
races
run
that
they
might
be
lost
plants
and
crosses
women
false
to
their
husbands
sons
false
to
their
fathers
daughters
to
their
mothers
servants
to
their
masters
affairs
always
secret
dark
foul
and
fraudulent
were
to
him
the
normal
condition
of
life
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
trevelyan
should
continue
to
correspond
with
her
lover
that
old
stanbury
should
betray
her
trust
by
conniving
at
the
lover
visit
that
everybody
concerned
should
be
steeped
to
the
hips
in
lies
and
iniquity
when
therefore
he
found
at
colonel
osborne
rooms
that
the
colonel
had
received
a
letter
with
the
lessboro
addressed
in
the
handwriting
of
a
woman
he
did
not
scruple
to
declare
that
colonel
osborne
had
received
on
that
morning
a
letter
from
trevelyan
lady
but
in
sending
to
her
husband
what
she
called
with
so
much
bitterness
the
correspondence
trevelyan
had
to
enclose
simply
the
copy
of
one
sheet
note
from
herself
but
she
now
wrote
again
to
colonel
osborne
and
enclosed
to
her
husband
not
a
copy
of
what
she
had
written
but
the
note
itself
it
was
as
follows
nuncombe
putney
wednesday
august
my
dear
colonel
osborne
my
husband
has
desired
me
not
to
see
you
or
to
write
to
you
or
to
hear
from
you
again
i
must
therefore
beg
you
to
enable
me
to
obey
him
at
any
rate
till
papa
comes
to
england
yours
truly
emily
trevelyan
and
then
she
wrote
to
her
husband
and
in
the
writing
of
this
letter
there
was
much
doubt
much
labour
and
many
changes
we
will
give
it
as
it
was
written
when
completed
i
have
received
your
letter
and
will
obey
your
commands
to
the
best
of
my
power
in
order
that
you
may
not
be
displeased
by
any
further
unavoidable
correspondence
between
me
and
colonel
osborne
i
have
written
to
him
a
note
which
i
now
send
to
you
i
send
it
that
you
may
forward
it
if
you
do
not
choose
to
do
so
i
can
not
be
answerable
either
for
his
seeing
me
or
for
his
writing
to
me
again
i
send
also
copies
of
all
the
correspondence
i
have
had
with
colonel
osborne
since
you
turned
me
out
of
your
house
when
he
came
to
call
on
me
nora
remained
with
me
while
he
was
here
i
blush
while
i
write
this
not
for
myself
but
that
i
should
be
so
suspected
as
to
make
such
a
statement
necessary
you
say
that
i
have
disgraced
you
and
myself
i
have
done
neither
i
am
disgraced
but
it
is
you
that
have
disgraced
me
i
have
never
spoken
a
word
or
done
a
thing
as
regards
you
of
which
i
have
cause
to
be
ashamed
i
have
told
stanbury
that
i
and
nora
will
leave
her
house
as
soon
as
we
can
be
made
to
know
where
we
are
to
go
i
beg
that
this
may
be
decided
instantly
as
else
we
must
walk
out
into
the
street
without
a
shelter
after
what
has
been
said
i
can
not
remain
here
my
sister
bids
me
say
that
she
will
relieve
you
of
all
burden
respecting
herself
as
soon
as
possible
she
will
probably
be
able
to
find
a
home
with
my
aunt
outhouse
till
papa
comes
to
england
as
for
myself
i
can
only
say
that
till
he
comes
i
shall
do
exactly
what
you
order
emily
trevelyan
nuncombe
putney
august
chapter
xxix
and
outhouse
both
outhouse
and
his
wife
were
especially
timid
in
taking
upon
themselves
the
cares
of
other
people
not
on
that
account
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
they
were
bad
or
selfish
they
were
both
given
much
to
charity
and
bestowed
both
in
time
and
money
more
than
is
ordinarily
considered
necessary
even
from
persons
in
their
position
but
what
they
gave
they
gave
away
from
their
own
quiet
hearth
had
money
been
wanting
to
the
daughters
of
his
wife
brother
outhouse
would
have
opened
such
small
coffer
as
he
had
with
a
free
hand
but
he
would
have
much
preferred
that
his
benevolence
should
be
used
in
a
way
that
would
bring
upon
him
no
further
responsibility
and
no
questionings
from
people
whom
he
did
not
know
and
could
not
understand
the
rev
oliphant
outhouse
had
been
rector
of
for
the
last
fifteen
years
having
married
the
sister
of
sir
marmaduke
rowley
then
simply
rowley
with
a
colonial
appointment
in
jamaica
of
per
annum
twelve
years
before
his
promotion
while
he
was
a
curate
in
one
of
the
populous
borough
parishes
he
had
thus
been
a
london
clergyman
all
his
life
but
he
knew
almost
as
little
of
london
society
as
though
he
had
held
a
cure
in
a
westmoreland
valley
he
had
worked
hard
but
his
work
had
been
altogether
among
the
poor
he
had
no
gift
of
preaching
and
had
acquired
neither
reputation
nor
popularity
but
he
could
work
and
having
been
transferred
because
of
that
capability
to
the
temporary
curacy
of
diddulph
out
of
one
diocese
into
another
he
had
received
the
living
from
the
bishop
hands
when
it
became
vacant
a
dreary
place
was
the
parsonage
of
for
the
abode
of
a
gentleman
outhouse
had
not
in
his
whole
parish
a
parishioner
with
whom
he
could
consort
the
greatest
men
around
him
were
the
publicans
and
the
most
numerous
were
men
employed
in
and
around
the
docks
dredgers
of
mud
navvies
employed
on
suburban
canals
excavators
loaders
and
unloaders
of
cargo
cattle
drivers
whose
driving
however
was
done
mostly
on
board
ship
such
and
such
like
were
the
men
who
were
the
fathers
of
the
families
of
and
there
was
there
not
far
removed
from
the
muddy
estuary
of
a
little
stream
that
makes
its
black
way
from
the
essex
marshes
among
the
houses
of
the
poorest
of
the
poor
into
the
thames
a
large
commercial
establishment
for
turning
the
carcasses
of
horses
into
manure
flowsem
and
blurt
were
in
truth
the
great
people
of
but
the
closeness
of
their
establishment
was
not
an
additional
attraction
to
the
parsonage
they
were
liberal
however
with
their
money
and
outhouse
was
disposed
to
think
custom
perhaps
having
made
the
establishment
less
objectionable
to
him
than
it
was
at
first
that
would
be
more
of
a
pandemonium
than
it
now
was
if
by
any
sanitary
law
flowsem
and
blurt
were
compelled
to
close
their
doors
non
olet
he
would
say
with
a
grim
smile
when
the
charitable
cheque
of
the
firm
would
come
punctually
to
hand
on
the
first
saturday
after
christmas
but
such
a
house
as
his
would
be
as
he
knew
but
a
poor
residence
for
his
wife
nieces
indeed
without
positively
saying
that
he
was
unwilling
to
receive
them
he
had
when
he
first
heard
of
the
breaking
up
of
the
house
in
curzon
street
shewn
that
he
would
rather
not
take
upon
his
shoulders
so
great
a
responsibility
he
and
his
wife
had
discussed
the
matter
between
them
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
did
not
know
what
kind
of
things
might
have
been
done
in
curzon
street
they
would
think
no
evil
they
said
but
the
very
idea
of
a
married
woman
with
a
lover
was
dreadful
to
them
it
might
be
that
their
niece
was
free
from
blame
they
hoped
so
and
even
though
her
sin
had
been
of
ever
so
deep
a
dye
they
would
take
her
in
if
it
were
indeed
necessary
but
they
hoped
that
such
help
from
them
might
not
be
needed
they
both
knew
how
to
give
counsel
to
a
poor
woman
how
to
rebuke
a
poor
man
how
to
comfort
encourage
or
to
upbraid
the
poor
practice
had
told
them
how
far
they
might
go
with
some
hope
of
doing
good
and
at
what
stage
of
demoralisation
no
good
from
their
hands
was
any
longer
within
the
scope
of
fair
expectation
but
all
this
was
among
the
poor
with
what
words
to
encourage
such
a
one
as
their
niece
trevelyan
to
encourage
her
or
to
rebuke
her
as
her
conduct
might
seem
to
make
necessary
they
both
felt
that
they
were
altogether
ignorant
to
them
trevelyan
was
a
fine
lady
to
outhouse
sir
marmaduke
had
ever
been
a
fine
gentleman
given
much
to
worldly
things
who
cared
more
for
whist
and
a
glass
of
wine
than
for
anything
else
and
who
thought
that
he
had
a
good
excuse
for
never
going
to
church
in
england
because
he
was
called
upon
as
he
said
to
show
himself
in
the
governor
pew
always
once
on
sundays
and
frequently
twice
when
he
was
at
the
seat
of
his
government
sir
marmaduke
manifestly
looked
upon
church
as
a
thing
in
itself
notoriously
disagreeable
to
outhouse
it
afforded
the
great
events
of
the
week
and
outhouse
would
declare
that
to
hear
her
husband
preach
was
the
greatest
joy
of
her
life
it
may
be
understood
therefore
that
though
the
family
connection
between
the
rowleys
and
the
outhouses
had
been
kept
up
with
a
semblance
of
affection
it
had
never
blossomed
forth
into
cordial
friendship
when
therefore
the
clergyman
of
diddulph
received
a
letter
from
his
niece
nora
begging
him
to
take
her
into
his
parsonage
till
sir
marmaduke
should
arrive
in
the
course
of
the
spring
and
hinting
also
a
wish
that
her
uncle
oliphant
should
see
trevelyan
and
if
possible
arrange
that
his
other
niece
should
also
come
to
the
parsonage
he
was
very
much
perturbed
in
spirit
there
was
a
long
consultation
between
him
and
his
wife
before
anything
could
be
settled
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
anything
would
have
been
settled
had
not
trevelyan
himself
made
his
way
to
the
parsonage
on
the
second
day
of
the
family
conference
and
outhouse
had
both
seen
the
necessity
of
sleeping
upon
the
matter
they
had
slept
upon
it
and
the
discourse
between
them
on
the
second
day
was
so
doubtful
in
its
tone
that
more
sleeping
would
probably
have
been
necessary
had
not
trevelyan
appeared
and
compelled
them
to
a
decision
you
must
remember
that
i
make
no
charge
against
her
said
trevelyan
after
the
matter
had
been
discussed
for
about
an
hour
then
why
should
she
not
come
back
to
you
said
outhouse
timidly
some
day
she
may
if
she
will
be
obedient
but
it
can
not
be
now
she
has
set
me
at
defiance
and
even
yet
it
is
too
clear
from
the
tone
of
her
letter
to
me
that
she
thinks
that
she
has
been
right
to
do
so
how
could
we
live
together
in
amity
when
she
addresses
me
as
a
cruel
tyrant
why
did
she
go
away
at
first
asked
outhouse
because
she
would
compromise
my
name
by
an
intimacy
which
i
did
not
approve
but
i
do
not
come
here
to
defend
myself
outhouse
you
probably
think
that
i
have
been
wrong
you
are
her
friend
and
to
you
i
will
not
even
say
that
i
have
been
right
what
i
want
you
to
understand
is
this
she
can
not
come
back
to
me
now
it
would
not
be
for
my
honour
that
she
should
do
so
but
sir
would
it
not
be
for
your
welfare
as
a
christian
asked
outhouse
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
if
i
say
that
i
will
not
discuss
that
just
now
i
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
it
it
is
very
sad
for
our
poor
niece
said
outhouse
it
is
very
sad
for
me
said
trevelyan
gloomily
very
sad
indeed
my
home
is
destroyed
my
life
is
made
solitary
i
do
not
even
see
my
own
child
she
has
her
boy
with
her
and
her
sister
i
have
nobody
i
ca
understand
for
the
life
of
me
why
you
should
not
live
together
just
like
any
other
people
said
outhouse
whose
woman
spirit
was
arising
in
her
bosom
when
people
are
married
they
must
put
up
with
something
at
least
most
always
this
she
added
lest
it
might
be
for
a
moment
imagined
that
she
had
had
any
cause
for
complaint
with
her
outhouse
pray
excuse
me
outhouse
but
i
can
not
discuss
that
the
question
between
us
is
this
can
you
consent
to
receive
your
two
nieces
till
their
father
return
and
if
so
in
what
way
shall
i
defray
the
expense
of
their
living
you
will
of
course
understand
that
i
willingly
undertake
the
expense
not
only
of
my
maintenance
and
of
her
sister
also
but
that
i
will
cheerfully
allow
anything
that
may
be
required
either
for
their
comfort
or
recreation
i
can
not
take
my
nieces
into
my
house
as
lodgers
said
outhouse
no
not
as
lodgers
but
of
course
you
can
understand
that
it
is
for
me
to
pay
for
my
own
wife
i
know
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
mentioning
it
but
how
else
could
i
make
my
request
to
you
if
emily
and
nora
come
here
they
must
come
as
our
guests
said
outhouse
certainly
said
the
clergyman
and
if
i
am
told
they
are
in
want
of
a
home
they
shall
find
one
here
till
their
father
comes
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
as
regards
the
elder
i
think
her
home
should
be
elsewhere
of
course
it
should
said
outhouse
i
do
know
anything
about
the
law
but
it
seems
to
me
very
odd
that
a
young
woman
should
be
turned
out
in
this
way
you
say
she
has
done
nothing
i
will
not
argue
the
matter
said
trevelyan
that
all
very
well
trevelyan
said
the
lady
but
she
my
own
niece
and
if
i
do
stand
up
for
her
i
do
know
who
will
i
never
heard
such
a
thing
in
my
life
as
a
wife
being
sent
away
after
such
a
fashion
as
that
we
would
treat
a
cookmaid
so
that
we
would
as
for
coming
here
she
shall
come
if
she
pleases
but
i
shall
always
say
that
it
the
greatest
shame
i
ever
heard
of
nothing
came
of
this
visit
at
last
the
lady
grew
in
her
anger
and
trevelyan
in
his
own
defence
was
driven
to
declare
that
his
wife
obstinate
intimacy
with
colonel
osborne
had
almost
driven
him
out
of
his
senses
before
he
left
the
parsonage
he
was
brought
even
to
tears
by
his
own
narration
of
his
own
misery
whereby
outhouse
was
considerably
softened
although
outhouse
became
more
and
more
stout
in
the
defence
of
her
own
sex
but
nothing
at
last
came
of
it
trevelyan
insisted
on
paying
for
his
wife
wherever
she
might
be
placed
and
when
he
found
that
this
would
not
be
permitted
to
him
at
the
parsonage
he
was
very
anxious
to
take
some
small
furnished
house
in
the
neighbourhood
in
which
the
two
sisters
might
live
for
the
next
six
months
under
the
wings
of
their
uncle
and
aunt
but
even
outhouse
was
moved
to
pleasantry
by
this
suggestion
as
he
explained
the
nature
of
the
tenements
which
were
common
at
diddulph
two
rooms
front
and
back
they
might
have
for
about
a
week
in
a
house
with
three
other
families
but
perhaps
that
is
not
exactly
what
you
like
said
outhouse
the
interview
ended
with
no
result
and
trevelyan
took
his
leave
declaring
to
himself
that
he
was
worse
off
than
the
foxes
who
have
holes
in
which
to
lay
their
heads
but
it
must
be
presumed
that
his
sufferings
in
this
respect
were
to
be
by
attorney
as
it
was
for
his
wife
and
not
for
himself
that
the
necessary
hole
was
now
required
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
outhouse
answered
nora
letter
and
without
meaning
to
be
explicit
explained
pretty
closely
what
had
taken
place
the
spare
bedroom
at
the
parsonage
was
ready
to
receive
either
one
or
both
of
the
sisters
till
sir
marmaduke
should
be
in
london
if
one
or
both
of
them
should
choose
to
come
and
though
there
was
no
nursery
at
the
parsonage
for
and
outhouse
had
been
blessed
with
no
children
still
room
should
be
made
for
the
little
boy
but
they
must
come
as
visitors
as
our
own
nieces
said
outhouse
and
she
went
on
to
say
that
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
quarrel
between
trevelyan
and
his
wife
all
such
quarrels
were
very
bad
but
as
to
this
quarrel
she
could
take
no
part
either
one
side
or
the
other
then
she
stated
that
trevelyan
had
been
at
the
parsonage
but
that
no
arrangement
had
been
made
because
trevelyan
had
insisted
on
paying
for
their
board
and
lodging
this
letter
reached
nuncombe
putney
before
any
reply
was
received
by
trevelyan
from
her
husband
this
was
on
the
saturday
morning
and
trevelyan
had
pledged
herself
to
stanbury
that
she
would
leave
the
clock
house
on
the
monday
of
course
there
was
no
need
that
she
should
do
so
both
stanbury
and
priscilla
would
now
have
willingly
consented
to
their
remaining
till
sir
marmaduke
should
be
in
england
but
trevelyan
high
spirit
revolted
against
this
after
all
that
had
been
said
she
thought
that
she
should
hear
from
her
husband
on
the
morrow
but
the
post
on
sunday
brought
no
letter
from
trevelyan
on
the
saturday
they
had
finished
packing
up
so
certain
was
trevelyan
that
some
instructions
as
to
her
future
destiny
would
be
sent
to
her
by
her
lord
at
last
they
decided
on
the
sunday
that
they
would
both
go
at
once
to
diddulph
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
that
this
was
the
decision
of
the
elder
sister
nora
would
willingly
have
yielded
to
priscilla
entreaties
and
have
remained
but
emily
declared
that
she
could
not
and
would
not
stay
in
the
house
she
had
a
few
pounds
what
would
suffice
for
her
journey
and
as
trevelyan
had
not
thought
proper
to
send
his
orders
to
her
she
would
go
without
them
outhouse
was
her
aunt
and
her
nearest
relative
in
england
upon
whom
else
could
she
lean
in
this
time
of
her
great
affliction
a
letter
therefore
was
written
to
outhouse
saying
that
the
whole
party
including
the
boy
and
nurse
would
be
at
diddulph
on
the
monday
evening
and
the
last
cord
was
put
to
the
boxes
i
suppose
that
he
is
very
angry
trevelyan
said
to
her
sister
but
i
do
not
feel
that
i
care
about
that
now
he
shall
have
nothing
to
complain
of
in
reference
to
any
gaiety
on
my
part
i
will
see
no
one
i
will
have
no
correspondence
but
i
will
not
remain
here
after
what
he
has
said
to
me
let
him
be
ever
so
angry
i
declare
as
i
think
of
it
it
seems
to
me
that
no
woman
was
ever
so
cruelly
treated
as
i
have
been
then
she
wrote
one
further
line
to
her
husband
not
having
received
any
orders
from
you
and
having
promised
stanbury
that
i
would
leave
this
house
on
monday
i
go
with
nora
to
my
aunt
outhouse
on
the
sunday
evening
the
four
ladies
drank
tea
together
and
they
all
made
an
effort
to
be
civil
and
even
affectionate
to
each
other
trevelyan
had
at
last
allowed
priscilla
to
explain
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
she
had
told
her
brother
that
it
would
be
better
both
for
her
mother
and
for
herself
that
the
existing
arrangements
should
be
brought
to
an
end
and
there
had
come
to
be
an
agreement
between
them
that
they
should
all
part
in
amity
but
the
conversation
on
the
sunday
evening
was
very
difficult
i
am
sure
we
shall
always
think
of
you
both
with
the
greatest
kindness
said
stanbury
as
for
me
said
priscilla
your
being
with
us
has
been
a
delight
that
i
can
not
describe
only
it
has
been
wrong
i
know
too
well
said
trevelyan
that
in
our
present
circumstances
we
are
unable
to
carry
delight
with
us
anywhere
you
hardly
understand
what
our
life
has
been
said
priscilla
but
the
truth
is
that
we
had
no
right
to
receive
you
in
such
a
house
as
this
it
has
not
been
our
way
of
living
and
it
can
not
continue
to
be
so
it
is
not
wonderful
that
people
should
talk
of
us
had
it
been
called
your
house
it
might
have
been
better
and
what
will
you
do
now
asked
nora
get
out
of
this
place
as
soon
as
we
can
it
is
often
hard
to
go
back
to
the
right
path
but
it
may
always
be
done
or
at
least
attempted
it
seems
to
me
that
i
take
misery
with
me
wherever
i
go
said
trevelyan
my
dear
it
has
not
been
your
fault
said
stanbury
i
do
not
like
to
blame
my
brother
said
priscilla
because
he
has
done
his
best
to
be
good
to
us
all
and
the
punishment
will
fall
heaviest
upon
him
because
he
must
pay
for
it
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
pay
a
shilling
said
trevelyan
then
the
morning
came
and
at
seven
the
two
sisters
with
the
nurse
and
child
started
for
lessboro
station
in
crocket
open
carriage
the
luggage
having
been
sent
on
in
a
cart
there
were
many
tears
shed
and
any
one
looking
at
the
party
would
have
thought
that
very
dear
friends
were
being
torn
asunder
mother
said
priscilla
as
soon
as
the
parlour
door
was
shut
and
the
two
were
alone
together
we
must
take
care
that
we
never
are
brought
again
into
such
a
mistake
as
that
they
who
protect
the
injured
should
be
strong
themselves
chapter
xxx
dorothy
makes
up
her
mind
it
was
true
that
most
things
had
been
said
at
and
at
nuncombe
putney
about
stanbury
and
the
visitors
at
the
clock
house
and
that
these
things
had
spread
themselves
to
exeter
ellison
of
lessboro
who
was
not
the
most
woman
in
the
world
had
told
merton
of
nuncombe
that
she
had
been
told
that
the
colonel
visit
to
the
lady
had
been
made
by
express
arrangement
between
the
colonel
and
stanbury
merton
who
was
very
but
not
the
wisest
woman
in
the
world
had
declared
that
any
such
conduct
on
the
part
of
stanbury
was
quite
impossible
what
does
it
matter
which
it
is
priscilla
or
her
mother
ellison
had
said
these
are
the
facts
trevelyan
has
been
sent
there
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
this
colonel
and
the
colonel
immediately
comes
down
and
sees
her
at
the
clock
house
but
when
people
are
very
poor
they
do
get
driven
to
do
almost
anything
merton
not
being
very
wise
had
conceived
it
to
be
her
duty
to
repeat
this
to
priscilla
and
ellison
not
being
very
had
conceived
it
to
be
hers
to
repeat
it
to
machugh
at
exeter
and
then
bozzle
coming
had
become
known
yes
machugh
a
policeman
in
mufti
down
at
nuncombe
i
wonder
what
our
friend
in
the
close
here
will
think
about
it
i
have
always
said
you
know
that
if
she
wanted
to
keep
things
straight
at
nuncombe
she
should
have
opened
her
from
all
which
it
may
be
understood
that
priscilla
stanbury
desire
to
go
back
to
their
old
way
of
living
had
not
been
without
reason
it
may
be
imagined
that
miss
stanbury
of
the
close
did
not
receive
with
equanimity
the
reports
which
reached
her
and
of
course
when
she
discussed
the
matter
either
with
martha
or
with
dorothy
she
fell
back
upon
her
own
early
appreciation
of
the
folly
of
the
clock
house
arrangement
nevertheless
she
had
called
ellison
very
bad
names
when
she
learned
from
her
friend
machugh
what
reports
were
being
spread
by
the
lady
from
lessboro
ellison
yes
we
all
know
ellison
the
bitterest
tongue
in
devonshire
and
the
falsest
there
are
some
people
at
lessboro
who
would
be
well
pleased
if
she
paid
her
way
there
as
well
as
those
poor
women
do
at
nuncombe
i
do
think
much
of
what
ellison
says
but
it
is
bad
about
the
policeman
said
machugh
of
course
it
bad
it
all
bad
i
not
saying
that
it
not
bad
i
glad
i
got
this
other
young
woman
out
of
it
it
all
that
young
man
doing
if
i
had
a
son
of
my
own
i
sooner
follow
him
to
the
grave
than
hear
him
call
himself
a
radical
then
on
a
sudden
there
came
to
the
close
news
that
trevelyan
and
her
sister
were
gone
on
the
very
monday
on
which
they
went
priscilla
sent
a
note
on
to
her
sister
in
which
no
special
allusion
was
made
to
aunt
stanbury
but
which
was
no
doubt
written
with
the
intention
that
the
news
should
be
communicated
gone
are
they
as
it
is
past
wishing
that
they
had
come
the
best
thing
they
could
do
now
and
who
is
to
pay
the
rent
of
the
house
now
they
have
gone
as
this
was
a
point
on
which
dorothy
was
not
prepared
to
trouble
herself
at
present
she
made
no
answer
to
the
question
dorothy
at
this
time
was
in
a
state
of
very
great
perturbation
on
her
own
account
the
reader
may
perhaps
remember
that
she
had
been
much
startled
by
a
proposition
that
had
been
made
to
her
in
reference
to
her
future
life
her
aunt
had
suggested
to
her
that
she
should
become
gibson
she
had
not
as
yet
given
any
answer
to
that
proposition
and
had
indeed
found
it
to
be
quite
impossible
to
speak
about
it
at
all
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
suggestion
had
opened
out
to
her
altogether
new
views
of
life
up
to
the
moment
of
her
aunt
speech
to
her
the
idea
of
her
becoming
a
married
woman
had
never
presented
itself
to
her
in
her
humility
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
she
should
be
counted
as
one
among
the
candidates
for
matrimony
priscilla
had
taught
her
to
regard
herself
indeed
they
had
both
so
regarded
themselves
as
born
to
eat
and
drink
as
little
as
might
be
and
then
to
die
now
when
she
was
told
that
she
could
if
she
pleased
become
gibson
she
was
almost
lost
in
a
whirl
of
new
and
confused
ideas
since
her
aunt
had
spoken
gibson
himself
had
dropped
a
hint
or
two
which
seemed
to
her
to
indicate
that
he
also
must
be
in
the
secret
there
had
been
a
party
with
a
supper
at
crumbie
at
which
both
the
miss
frenches
had
been
present
but
gibson
had
taken
her
dorothy
stanbury
out
to
supper
leaving
both
camilla
and
arabella
behind
him
in
the
during
the
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
in
which
the
ladies
were
alone
while
the
gentlemen
were
eating
and
drinking
both
camilla
and
arabella
continued
to
wreak
their
vengeance
they
asked
questions
about
trevelyan
and
suggested
that
gibson
might
be
sent
over
to
put
things
right
but
miss
stanbury
had
heard
them
and
had
fallen
upon
them
with
a
heavy
hand
there
a
good
deal
expected
of
gibson
my
dears
she
said
which
it
seems
to
me
gibson
is
not
inclined
to
perform
it
is
quite
indifferent
to
us
what
gibson
may
be
inclined
to
perform
said
arabella
i
sure
we
sha
interfere
with
miss
dorothy
as
this
was
said
quite
out
loud
before
all
the
other
ladies
dorothy
was
overcome
with
shame
but
her
aunt
comforted
her
when
they
were
again
at
home
laws
my
dear
what
does
it
matter
when
you
gibson
be
proud
of
it
all
was
it
then
really
written
in
the
book
of
the
fates
that
she
dorothy
stanbury
was
to
become
gibson
poor
dorothy
began
to
feel
that
she
was
called
upon
to
exercise
an
amount
of
thought
and
personal
decision
to
which
she
had
not
been
accustomed
hitherto
in
the
things
which
she
had
done
or
left
undone
she
had
received
instructions
which
she
could
obey
had
her
mother
and
priscilla
told
her
positively
not
to
go
to
her
aunt
house
she
would
have
remained
at
nuncombe
without
complaint
had
her
aunt
since
her
coming
given
her
orders
as
to
her
mode
of
life
enjoined
for
instance
additional
church
attendances
or
desired
her
to
perform
menial
services
in
the
house
she
would
have
obeyed
from
custom
without
a
word
but
when
she
was
told
that
she
was
to
marry
gibson
it
did
seem
to
her
to
be
necessary
to
do
something
more
than
obey
did
she
love
gibson
she
tried
hard
to
teach
herself
to
think
that
she
might
learn
to
love
him
he
was
a
man
enough
with
sandy
hair
and
a
head
rather
bald
with
thin
lips
and
a
narrow
nose
who
certainly
did
preach
drawling
sermons
but
of
whom
everybody
said
that
he
was
a
very
excellent
clergyman
he
had
a
house
and
an
income
and
all
exeter
had
long
since
decided
that
he
was
a
man
who
would
certainly
marry
he
was
one
of
those
men
of
whom
it
may
be
said
that
they
have
no
possible
claim
to
remain
unmarried
he
was
fair
game
and
unless
he
surrendered
himself
to
be
bagged
before
long
would
subject
himself
to
just
and
loud
complaint
the
miss
frenches
had
been
aware
of
this
and
had
thought
to
make
sure
of
him
among
them
it
was
a
little
hard
upon
them
that
the
old
maid
of
the
close
as
they
always
called
miss
stanbury
should
interfere
with
them
when
their
booty
was
almost
won
and
they
felt
it
to
be
the
harder
because
dorothy
stanbury
was
as
they
thought
so
poor
a
creature
that
dorothy
herself
should
have
any
doubt
as
to
accepting
gibson
was
an
idea
that
never
occurred
to
them
but
dorothy
had
her
doubts
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
she
remembered
that
she
had
never
as
yet
spoken
a
word
to
gibson
beyond
such
little
trifling
remarks
as
are
made
over
a
she
might
learn
to
love
him
but
she
did
not
think
that
she
loved
him
as
yet
i
do
suppose
all
this
will
make
any
difference
to
gibson
said
miss
stanbury
to
her
niece
on
the
morning
after
the
receipt
of
priscilla
note
stating
that
the
trevelyans
had
left
nuncombe
dorothy
always
blushed
when
gibson
name
was
mentioned
and
she
blushed
now
but
she
did
not
at
all
understand
her
aunt
allusion
i
do
know
what
you
mean
aunt
she
said
well
you
know
my
dear
what
they
say
about
trevelyan
and
the
clock
house
is
not
very
nice
if
gibson
were
to
turn
round
and
say
that
the
connection
was
pleasant
no
one
would
have
a
right
to
complain
the
faint
customary
blush
on
dorothy
cheeks
which
gibson
name
had
produced
now
covered
her
whole
face
even
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
if
he
believes
bad
of
mamma
i
sure
aunt
stanbury
i
want
to
see
him
again
that
all
very
fine
my
dear
but
a
man
has
to
think
of
himself
you
know
of
course
he
thinks
of
himself
why
should
he
i
dare
say
he
thinks
of
himself
more
than
i
do
dorothy
do
be
a
fool
a
good
husband
is
to
be
caught
every
day
aunt
stanbury
i
do
want
to
catch
any
man
dorothy
do
be
a
fool
i
must
say
it
i
do
suppose
gibson
thinks
of
me
the
least
in
the
world
psha
i
tell
you
he
does
but
as
for
mamma
and
priscilla
i
never
could
like
anybody
for
a
moment
who
would
be
ashamed
of
them
she
was
most
anxious
to
declare
that
as
far
as
she
knew
herself
and
her
own
wishes
at
present
she
entertained
no
partiality
for
gibson
no
feeling
which
could
become
partiality
even
if
gibson
was
to
declare
himself
willing
to
accept
her
mother
and
her
sister
with
herself
but
she
did
not
dare
to
say
so
there
was
an
instinct
within
her
which
made
it
almost
impossible
to
her
to
express
an
objection
to
a
suitor
before
the
suitor
had
declared
himself
to
be
one
she
could
speak
out
as
touching
her
mother
and
her
sister
but
as
to
her
own
feelings
she
could
express
neither
assent
nor
dissent
i
should
like
to
have
it
settled
soon
said
miss
stanbury
in
a
melancholy
voice
even
to
this
dorothy
could
make
no
reply
what
did
soon
mean
perhaps
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
if
it
could
be
arranged
by
the
end
of
this
week
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
dorothy
almost
fell
off
her
chair
and
was
stricken
altogether
dumb
i
told
you
i
think
that
brooke
burgess
is
coming
here
you
said
he
was
to
come
some
day
he
is
to
be
here
on
monday
i
have
seen
him
for
more
than
twelve
years
and
now
he
to
be
here
next
week
dear
dear
when
i
think
sometimes
of
all
the
hard
words
that
have
been
spoken
and
the
harder
thoughts
that
have
been
in
people
minds
i
often
regret
that
the
money
ever
came
to
me
at
all
i
could
have
done
without
it
very
well
very
well
but
all
the
unpleasantness
is
over
now
aunt
i
do
know
about
that
unpleasantness
of
that
kind
is
apt
to
rankle
long
but
i
was
going
to
give
up
my
rights
nobody
but
a
coward
does
that
they
talked
of
going
to
law
and
trying
the
will
but
they
would
have
got
much
by
that
and
then
they
abused
me
for
two
years
when
they
had
done
and
got
sick
of
it
i
told
them
they
should
have
it
all
back
again
as
soon
as
i
am
dead
it
wo
be
long
now
this
burgess
is
the
elder
nephew
and
he
shall
have
it
all
is
not
he
grateful
no
why
should
he
be
grateful
i
do
do
it
for
special
love
of
him
i
do
want
his
gratitude
nor
anybody
gratitude
look
at
hugh
i
did
love
him
i
am
grateful
aunt
stanbury
are
you
my
dear
then
show
it
by
being
a
good
wife
to
gibson
and
a
happy
wife
i
want
to
get
everything
settled
while
burgess
is
here
if
he
is
to
have
it
why
should
i
keep
him
out
of
it
whilst
i
live
i
wonder
whether
gibson
would
mind
coming
and
living
here
dolly
the
thing
was
coming
so
near
to
her
that
dorothy
began
to
feel
that
she
must
in
truth
make
up
her
mind
and
let
her
aunt
know
also
how
it
had
been
made
up
she
was
sensible
enough
to
perceive
that
if
she
did
not
prepare
herself
for
the
occasion
she
would
find
herself
hampered
by
an
engagement
simply
because
her
aunt
had
presumed
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
not
acquiesce
she
would
drift
into
marriage
with
gibson
against
her
will
her
greatest
difficulty
was
the
fact
that
her
aunt
clearly
had
no
doubt
on
the
subject
and
as
for
herself
hitherto
her
feelings
did
not
on
either
side
go
beyond
doubts
assuredly
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
for
her
to
become
gibson
if
only
she
could
create
for
herself
some
attachment
for
the
man
at
the
present
moment
her
aunt
said
nothing
more
about
gibson
having
her
mind
much
occupied
with
the
coming
of
brooke
burgess
i
remember
him
twenty
years
ago
and
more
as
nice
a
boy
as
you
would
wish
to
see
his
father
was
the
fourth
of
the
brothers
dear
dear
three
of
them
are
gone
and
the
only
one
remaining
is
old
barty
whom
no
one
ever
loved
the
burgesses
had
been
great
people
in
exeter
having
been
both
bankers
and
brewers
there
but
the
light
of
the
family
had
paled
and
though
bartholomew
burgess
of
whom
miss
stanbury
declared
that
no
one
had
ever
loved
him
still
had
a
share
in
the
bank
it
was
well
understood
in
the
city
that
the
real
wealth
in
the
firm
of
cropper
and
burgess
belonged
to
the
cropper
family
indeed
the
most
considerable
portion
of
the
fortune
that
had
been
realised
by
old
burgess
had
come
into
the
possession
of
miss
stanbury
herself
bartholomew
burgess
had
never
forgiven
his
brother
will
and
between
him
and
jemima
stanbury
the
feud
was
irreconcileable
the
next
brother
tom
burgess
had
been
a
solicitor
at
liverpool
and
had
done
well
there
but
miss
stanbury
knew
nothing
of
the
tom
burgesses
as
she
called
them
the
fourth
brother
harry
burgess
had
been
a
clergyman
and
this
brooke
burgess
junior
who
was
now
coming
to
the
close
had
been
left
with
a
widowed
mother
the
eldest
of
a
large
family
it
need
not
now
be
told
at
length
how
there
had
been
also
between
this
clergyman
and
the
heiress
there
had
been
attempts
at
friendship
and
at
one
time
miss
stanbury
had
received
the
rev
harry
burgess
and
all
his
family
at
the
close
but
the
attempts
had
not
been
successful
and
though
our
old
friend
had
never
wavered
in
her
determination
to
leave
the
money
all
back
to
some
one
of
the
burgess
family
and
with
this
view
had
made
a
pilgrimage
to
london
some
twelve
years
since
and
had
renewed
her
acquaintance
with
the
widow
and
the
children
still
there
had
been
no
comfortable
relations
between
her
and
any
of
the
burgess
family
old
barty
burgess
whom
she
met
in
the
close
or
saw
in
the
high
street
every
day
of
her
life
was
her
great
enemy
he
had
tried
his
best
so
at
least
she
was
convinced
to
drive
her
out
of
the
pale
of
society
years
upon
years
ago
by
saying
evil
things
of
her
she
had
conquered
in
that
combat
her
victory
had
been
complete
and
she
had
triumphed
after
a
most
signal
fashion
but
this
triumph
did
not
silence
tongue
nor
soften
his
heart
when
she
prayed
to
be
forgiven
as
she
herself
forgave
others
she
always
exempted
barty
burgess
from
her
prayers
there
are
things
which
flesh
and
blood
can
not
do
she
had
not
liked
harry
burgess
widow
nor
for
the
matter
of
that
harry
burgess
himself
when
she
had
last
seen
the
children
she
had
not
liked
any
of
them
much
and
had
had
her
doubts
even
as
to
brooke
but
with
that
branch
of
the
family
she
was
willing
to
try
again
brooke
was
now
coming
to
the
close
having
received
however
an
intimation
that
if
during
his
visit
to
exeter
he
chose
to
see
his
uncle
barty
any
such
intercourse
must
be
kept
quite
in
the
background
while
he
remained
in
miss
stanbury
house
he
was
to
remain
there
as
though
there
were
no
such
person
as
bartholomew
burgess
in
exeter
at
this
time
brooke
burgess
was
a
man
just
turned
thirty
and
was
a
clerk
in
the
ecclesiastical
record
office
in
somerset
house
no
doubt
the
peculiar
nature
and
name
of
the
public
department
to
which
he
was
attached
had
done
something
to
recommend
him
to
miss
stanbury
ecclesiastical
records
were
things
greatly
to
be
reverenced
in
her
eyes
and
she
felt
that
a
gentleman
who
handled
them
and
dealt
with
them
would
probably
be
sedate
gentlemanlike
and
conservative
brooke
burgess
when
she
had
last
seen
him
was
just
about
to
enter
upon
the
duties
of
the
office
then
there
had
come
offence
and
she
had
in
truth
known
nothing
of
him
from
that
day
to
this
the
visitor
was
to
be
at
exeter
on
the
following
monday
and
very
much
was
done
in
preparation
of
his
coming
there
was
to
be
a
dinner
party
on
that
very
day
and
dinner
parties
were
not
common
with
miss
stanbury
she
had
however
explained
to
martha
that
she
intended
to
put
her
best
foot
forward
martha
understood
perfectly
that
brooke
burgess
was
to
be
received
as
the
heir
of
property
sir
peter
mancrudy
the
great
devonshire
chemist
was
coming
to
dinner
and
and
powel
from
haldon
people
of
great
distinction
in
that
part
of
the
county
machugh
of
course
and
equally
of
course
gibson
there
was
a
deep
discussion
between
miss
stanbury
and
martha
as
to
asking
two
of
the
cliffords
and
and
noel
from
doddiscombeleigh
martha
had
been
very
much
in
favour
of
having
twelve
miss
stanbury
had
declared
that
with
twelve
she
must
have
two
waiters
from
the
greengrocer
and
that
two
waiters
would
overpower
her
own
domesticities
below
stairs
martha
had
declared
that
she
did
care
about
them
any
more
than
if
they
were
puppy
dogs
but
miss
stanbury
had
been
quite
firm
against
twelve
she
had
consented
to
have
ten
for
the
sake
of
artistic
arrangement
at
the
table
they
should
be
pantaloons
and
petticoats
alternate
you
know
she
had
said
to
martha
and
had
therefore
asked
the
cliffords
but
the
cliffords
could
not
come
and
then
she
had
declined
to
make
any
further
attempt
indeed
a
new
idea
had
struck
her
brooke
burgess
her
guest
should
sit
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
gibson
the
clergyman
at
the
other
in
this
way
the
proper
alternation
would
be
effected
when
martha
heard
this
martha
quite
understood
the
extent
of
the
good
fortune
that
was
in
store
for
dorothy
if
gibson
was
to
be
welcomed
in
that
way
it
could
only
be
in
preparation
of
his
becoming
one
of
the
family
and
dorothy
herself
became
aware
that
she
must
make
up
her
mind
it
was
not
so
declared
to
her
but
she
came
to
understand
that
it
was
very
probable
that
something
would
occur
on
the
coming
monday
which
would
require
her
to
be
ready
with
her
answer
on
that
day
and
she
was
greatly
tormented
by
feeling
that
if
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
accept
gibson
should
gibson
propose
to
her
as
to
which
she
continued
to
tell
herself
that
the
chance
of
such
a
thing
must
be
very
remote
indeed
but
that
if
he
should
propose
to
her
and
if
she
could
not
accept
him
her
aunt
ought
to
know
that
it
would
be
so
before
the
moment
came
but
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
to
her
aunt
as
though
any
such
proposition
were
possible
it
happened
that
during
the
week
on
the
saturday
priscilla
came
into
exeter
dorothy
met
her
sister
at
the
railway
station
and
then
the
two
walked
together
two
miles
and
back
along
the
crediton
road
aunt
stanbury
had
consented
to
priscilla
coming
to
the
close
even
though
it
was
not
the
day
appointed
for
such
visits
but
the
walk
had
been
preferred
and
dorothy
felt
that
she
would
be
able
to
ask
for
counsel
from
the
only
human
being
to
whom
she
could
have
brought
herself
to
confide
the
fact
that
a
gentleman
was
expected
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
but
it
was
not
till
they
had
turned
upon
their
walk
that
she
was
able
to
open
her
mouth
on
the
subject
even
to
her
sister
priscilla
had
been
very
full
of
their
own
cares
at
nuncombe
and
had
said
much
of
her
determination
to
leave
the
clock
house
and
to
return
to
the
retirement
of
some
small
cottage
she
had
already
written
to
hugh
to
this
effect
and
during
their
walk
had
said
much
of
her
own
folly
in
having
consented
to
so
great
a
change
in
their
mode
of
life
at
last
dorothy
struck
in
with
her
story
aunt
stanbury
wants
me
to
make
a
change
too
what
change
asked
priscilla
anxiously
it
is
not
my
idea
priscilla
and
i
do
think
that
there
can
be
anything
in
it
indeed
i
sure
there
is
i
do
see
how
possible
that
there
should
be
but
what
is
it
dolly
i
suppose
there
ca
be
any
harm
in
my
telling
you
if
it
anything
concerning
yourself
i
should
say
not
if
it
concerns
aunt
stanbury
i
dare
say
she
rather
you
held
your
tongue
it
concerns
me
most
said
dorothy
she
does
want
you
to
leave
her
does
she
well
yes
no
by
what
she
said
last
i
should
leave
her
at
all
in
that
way
only
i
sure
it
not
possible
i
am
the
worst
hand
in
the
world
dolly
at
guessing
a
riddle
you
heard
of
that
gibson
the
clergyman
have
you
of
course
i
have
well
mind
you
know
it
only
what
aunt
stanbury
says
he
has
never
so
much
as
opened
his
lips
to
me
himself
except
to
say
do
you
do
and
that
kind
of
thing
aunt
stanbury
wants
you
to
marry
him
yes
well
of
course
it
out
of
the
question
said
dorothy
sadly
i
do
see
why
it
should
be
out
of
the
question
said
priscilla
proudly
indeed
if
aunt
stanbury
has
said
much
about
it
i
should
say
that
gibson
himself
must
have
spoken
to
her
do
you
think
he
has
i
do
not
believe
that
my
aunt
would
raise
false
hopes
said
priscilla
but
i
have
any
hopes
that
is
to
say
i
had
never
thought
about
such
a
thing
but
you
think
about
it
now
dolly
i
should
never
have
dreamed
about
it
only
for
aunt
stanbury
but
dearest
you
are
dreaming
of
it
now
are
you
not
only
because
she
says
that
it
is
to
be
so
you
do
know
how
generous
she
is
she
says
that
if
it
should
be
so
she
will
give
me
ever
so
much
money
two
thousand
pounds
then
i
am
quite
sure
that
she
and
gibson
must
understand
each
other
of
course
said
dorothy
sadly
if
he
were
to
think
of
such
a
thing
at
all
it
would
only
be
because
the
money
would
be
convenient
not
at
all
said
priscilla
sternly
with
a
sternness
that
was
very
comfortable
to
her
listener
not
at
all
why
should
not
gibson
love
you
as
well
as
any
man
ever
loved
any
woman
you
are
dorothy
blushed
beneath
her
hat
even
at
her
praise
and
and
lovable
in
every
way
and
i
think
you
are
just
fitted
to
make
a
good
wife
and
you
must
not
suppose
dolly
that
because
gibson
would
perhaps
have
asked
you
without
the
money
that
therefore
he
is
mercenary
it
so
often
happens
that
a
gentleman
ca
marry
unless
the
lady
has
some
money
but
he
has
asked
me
at
all
i
suppose
he
will
dear
i
only
know
what
aunt
stanbury
says
you
may
be
sure
that
he
will
ask
you
and
what
must
i
say
priscilla
what
must
you
say
nobody
can
tell
you
that
dear
but
yourself
do
you
like
him
i
do
dislike
him
is
that
all
i
know
him
so
very
little
priscilla
everybody
says
he
is
very
good
and
then
it
a
great
thing
is
it
that
he
should
be
a
clergyman
i
do
know
about
that
i
think
it
is
if
it
were
possible
that
i
should
ever
marry
any
one
i
should
like
a
clergyman
so
much
the
best
then
you
do
know
what
to
say
to
him
no
i
do
priscilla
i
do
know
at
all
look
here
dearest
what
my
aunt
offers
to
you
is
a
very
great
step
in
life
if
you
can
accept
this
gentleman
i
think
you
would
be
happy
and
i
think
also
which
should
be
of
more
importance
for
your
consideration
that
you
would
make
him
happy
it
is
a
brighter
prospect
dear
dolly
than
to
live
either
with
us
at
nuncombe
or
even
with
aunt
stanbury
as
her
niece
but
if
i
do
love
him
priscilla
then
give
it
up
and
be
as
you
are
my
own
own
dearest
sister
so
i
will
said
dorothy
and
at
that
time
her
mind
was
made
up

chapter
xxxi
brooke
burgess
illustration
the
hour
at
which
brooke
burgess
was
to
arrive
had
come
round
and
miss
stanbury
was
in
a
twitter
partly
of
expectation
and
partly
it
must
be
confessed
of
fear
why
there
should
be
any
fear
she
did
not
herself
know
as
she
had
much
to
give
and
nothing
to
expect
but
she
was
afraid
and
was
conscious
of
it
and
was
out
of
temper
because
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
although
it
would
be
necessary
that
she
should
again
dress
for
dinner
at
six
she
had
put
on
a
clean
cap
at
four
and
appeared
at
that
early
hour
in
one
of
her
gowns
which
was
not
customarily
in
use
for
home
purposes
at
that
early
hour
she
felt
that
she
was
an
old
fool
for
her
pains
and
was
consequently
cross
to
poor
dorothy
and
there
were
other
reasons
for
some
display
of
harshness
to
her
niece
gibson
had
been
at
the
house
that
very
morning
and
dorothy
had
given
herself
airs
at
least
so
miss
stanbury
thought
and
during
the
last
three
or
four
days
whenever
gibson
name
had
been
mentioned
dorothy
had
become
silent
glum
and
almost
obstructive
miss
stanbury
had
been
at
the
trouble
of
explaining
that
she
was
specially
anxious
to
have
that
little
matter
of
the
engagement
settled
at
once
she
knew
that
she
was
going
to
behave
with
great
generosity
that
she
was
going
to
sacrifice
not
her
money
only
of
which
she
did
not
think
much
but
a
considerable
portion
of
her
authority
of
which
she
did
think
a
great
deal
and
that
she
was
about
to
behave
in
a
manner
which
demanded
much
gratitude
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
dorothy
was
not
in
the
least
grateful
hugh
had
proved
himself
to
be
a
mass
of
ingratitude
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
none
of
the
burgesses
had
ever
shown
to
her
any
gratitude
for
promises
made
to
them
or
indeed
for
any
substantial
favours
conferred
upon
them
and
now
dorothy
to
whom
a
very
seventh
heaven
of
happiness
had
been
opened
a
seventh
heaven
as
it
must
be
computed
in
comparison
with
her
low
expectations
now
dorothy
was
already
shewing
how
thankless
she
could
become
gibson
had
not
yet
declared
his
passion
but
he
had
freely
admitted
to
miss
stanbury
that
he
was
prepared
to
do
so
priscilla
had
been
quite
right
in
her
suggestion
that
there
was
a
clear
understanding
between
the
clergyman
and
her
aunt
i
do
think
he
is
come
after
all
said
miss
stanbury
looking
at
her
watch
had
the
train
arrived
at
the
moment
that
it
was
due
had
the
expectant
visitor
jumped
out
of
the
railway
carriage
into
a
fly
and
had
the
driver
galloped
up
to
the
close
it
might
have
been
possible
that
the
wheels
should
have
been
at
the
door
as
miss
stanbury
spoke
it
hardly
time
yet
aunt
nonsense
it
is
time
the
train
comes
in
at
four
i
dare
say
he
wo
come
at
all
he
is
sure
to
come
aunt
i
no
doubt
you
know
all
about
it
better
than
any
one
else
you
usually
do
then
five
minutes
were
passed
in
silence
heaven
and
earth
what
shall
i
do
with
these
people
that
are
coming
and
i
told
them
especially
that
it
was
to
meet
this
young
man
it
the
way
i
am
always
treated
by
everybody
that
i
have
about
me
the
train
might
be
ten
minutes
late
aunt
stanbury
yes
and
monkeys
might
chew
tobacco
there
there
the
omnibus
at
the
cock
and
bottle
the
omnibus
up
from
the
train
now
of
course
he
wo
come
perhaps
he
walking
aunt
stanbury
walking
with
his
luggage
on
his
shoulders
is
that
your
idea
of
the
way
in
which
a
london
gentleman
goes
about
and
there
are
two
flies
coming
up
from
the
train
of
course
miss
stanbury
was
obliged
to
fix
the
side
of
her
chair
very
close
to
the
window
in
order
that
she
might
see
that
part
of
the
close
in
which
the
vehicles
of
which
she
had
spoken
were
able
to
pass
perhaps
they
are
not
coming
from
the
train
aunt
stanbury
perhaps
a
fiddlestick
you
have
lived
here
so
much
longer
than
i
have
done
that
of
course
you
must
know
all
about
it
then
there
was
an
interval
of
another
ten
minutes
and
even
dorothy
was
beginning
to
think
that
burgess
was
not
coming
i
given
him
up
now
said
miss
stanbury
i
think
i
send
and
put
them
all
off
just
at
that
moment
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
but
there
was
no
cab
dorothy
conjecture
had
been
right
the
london
gentleman
had
walked
and
his
portmanteau
had
been
carried
behind
him
by
a
boy
how
did
he
get
here
exclaimed
miss
stanbury
as
she
heard
the
strange
voice
speaking
to
martha
but
dorothy
knew
better
than
to
answer
the
question
miss
stanbury
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
said
brooke
burgess
as
he
entered
the
room
miss
stanbury
courtesied
and
then
took
him
by
both
hands
you
would
have
known
me
i
dare
say
he
continued
a
black
beard
and
a
bald
head
do
make
a
difference
you
are
not
bald
at
all
said
miss
stanbury
i
am
beginning
to
be
thin
enough
at
the
top
i
am
so
glad
to
come
to
you
and
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
having
me
how
well
i
remember
the
old
room
this
is
my
niece
miss
dorothy
stanbury
from
nuncombe
putney
dorothy
was
about
to
make
some
formal
acknowledgment
of
the
introduction
when
brooke
burgess
came
up
to
her
and
shook
her
hand
heartily
she
lives
with
me
continued
the
aunt
and
what
has
become
of
hugh
said
brooke
we
never
talk
of
him
said
miss
stanbury
gravely
i
hope
there
nothing
wrong
i
hear
of
him
very
often
in
london
my
aunt
and
he
do
agree
that
all
said
dorothy
he
has
given
up
his
profession
as
a
barrister
in
which
he
might
have
lived
like
a
gentleman
said
miss
stanbury
and
has
taken
to
writing
for
a
penny
newspaper
everybody
does
that
now
miss
stanbury
i
hope
you
do
mr
burgess
i
nobody
would
print
anything
that
i
wrote
i
do
write
for
anything
certainly
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
said
miss
stanbury
brooke
burgess
or
brooke
as
he
came
to
be
called
very
shortly
by
the
servants
in
the
house
was
a
man
with
black
whiskers
and
black
hair
which
as
he
said
was
beginning
to
be
thin
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
pleasant
small
bright
eyes
dorothy
thought
that
next
to
her
brother
hugh
he
was
the
most
looking
man
she
had
ever
seen
he
was
rather
below
the
middle
height
and
somewhat
inclined
to
be
stout
but
he
would
boast
that
he
could
still
walk
his
twelve
miles
in
three
hours
and
would
add
that
as
long
as
he
could
do
that
he
would
never
recognise
the
necessity
of
putting
himself
on
short
commons
he
had
a
nose
not
quite
aquiline
but
tending
that
way
a
chin
with
a
dimple
on
it
and
as
sweet
a
mouth
as
ever
declared
the
excellence
of
a
man
temper
dorothy
immediately
began
to
compare
him
with
her
brother
hugh
who
was
to
her
of
all
men
the
most
godlike
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
make
any
comparison
between
gibson
and
burgess
her
brother
hugh
was
the
most
godlike
of
men
but
there
was
something
godlike
also
about
the
new
comer
gibson
to
dorothy
eyes
was
by
no
means
divine
i
used
to
call
you
aunt
stanbury
said
brooke
burgess
to
the
old
lady
am
i
to
go
on
doing
it
now
you
may
call
me
what
you
like
said
miss
stanbury
only
dear
me
i
never
did
see
anybody
so
much
altered
before
she
went
up
to
dress
herself
for
dinner
miss
stanbury
was
quite
restored
to
her
good
humour
as
dorothy
could
perceive
the
dinner
passed
off
well
enough
gibson
at
the
head
of
the
table
did
indeed
look
very
much
out
of
his
element
as
though
he
conceived
that
his
position
revealed
to
the
outer
world
those
ideas
of
his
in
regard
to
dorothy
which
ought
to
have
been
secret
for
a
while
longer
there
are
few
men
who
do
not
feel
ashamed
of
being
paraded
before
the
world
as
acknowledged
suitors
whereas
ladies
accept
the
position
with
something
almost
of
triumph
the
lady
perhaps
regards
herself
as
the
successful
angler
whereas
the
gentleman
is
conscious
of
some
similitude
to
the
unsuccessful
fish
gibson
though
he
was
not
yet
gasping
in
the
basket
had
some
presentiment
of
this
feeling
which
made
his
present
seat
of
honour
unpleasant
to
him
brooke
burgess
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
was
as
gay
as
a
lark
machugh
sat
on
one
side
of
him
and
miss
stanbury
on
the
other
and
he
laughed
at
the
two
old
ladies
reminding
them
of
his
former
doings
in
exeter
how
he
had
hunted
machugh
cat
and
had
stolen
aunt
stanbury
best
apricot
jam
till
everybody
began
to
perceive
that
he
was
quite
a
success
even
sir
peter
mancrudy
laughed
at
his
jokes
and
powel
from
the
other
side
of
sir
peter
stretched
her
head
forward
so
that
she
might
become
one
of
the
gay
party
there
is
a
word
of
it
true
said
miss
stanbury
it
all
pure
invention
and
a
great
scandal
i
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
did
you
though
said
brooke
burgess
i
remember
it
as
well
as
if
it
was
yesterday
and
old
ball
the
prebendary
with
the
carbuncles
on
his
nose
saw
it
too
ball
had
no
carbuncles
on
his
nose
said
machugh
say
next
that
i
have
carbuncles
on
my
nose
he
had
three
i
remember
each
of
them
quite
well
and
so
does
sir
peter
then
everybody
laughed
and
martha
who
was
in
the
room
knew
that
brooke
burgess
was
a
complete
success
in
the
meantime
gibson
was
talking
to
dorothy
but
dorothy
was
endeavouring
to
listen
to
the
conversation
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
i
found
it
very
dirty
on
the
roads
outside
the
city
said
gibson
very
dirty
said
dorothy
looking
round
at
burgess
as
she
spoke
but
the
pavement
in
the
high
street
was
dry
enough
quite
dry
said
dorothy
then
there
came
a
peal
of
laughter
from
machugh
and
sir
peter
and
dorothy
wondered
whether
anybody
before
had
ever
made
those
two
steady
old
people
laugh
after
that
fashion
i
should
so
like
to
get
a
drive
with
you
up
to
the
top
of
haldon
hill
said
gibson
when
the
weather
gets
fine
that
is
powel
was
talking
about
it
it
would
be
very
nice
said
dorothy
you
have
never
seen
the
view
from
haldon
hill
yet
asked
gibson
but
to
this
question
dorothy
could
make
no
answer
miss
stanbury
had
lifted
one
of
the
as
though
she
was
going
to
strike
brooke
burgess
with
the
bowl
of
it
and
this
during
a
dinner
party
from
that
moment
dorothy
turned
herself
round
and
became
one
of
the
listeners
to
the
fun
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
poor
gibson
soon
found
himself
nowhere
i
never
saw
a
man
so
much
altered
in
my
life
said
machugh
up
in
the
i
do
remember
that
he
used
to
be
clever
he
was
a
bright
boy
said
miss
stanbury
but
the
burgesses
all
used
to
be
such
serious
people
said
machugh
excellent
people
she
added
remembering
the
source
of
her
friend
wealth
but
none
of
them
like
that
i
call
him
a
very
handsome
man
said
powel
i
suppose
not
married
yet
oh
dear
no
said
miss
stanbury
there
time
enough
for
him
yet
he
find
plenty
here
to
set
their
caps
at
him
said
machugh
he
a
little
old
for
my
girls
said
powel
laughing
powel
was
the
happy
mother
of
four
daughters
of
whom
the
eldest
was
only
twelve
there
are
others
who
are
more
forward
said
machugh
what
a
chance
it
would
be
for
dear
arabella
french
heaven
forbid
said
miss
stanbury
and
then
poor
gibson
would
be
any
longer
like
the
donkey
between
two
bundles
of
hay
said
powel
dorothy
was
quite
determined
that
she
would
never
marry
a
man
who
was
like
a
donkey
between
two
bundles
of
hay
when
the
gentlemen
came
up
into
the
dorothy
was
seated
behind
the
urn
and
at
a
large
table
in
such
a
position
as
to
be
approached
only
at
one
side
there
was
one
chair
at
her
left
hand
but
at
her
right
hand
there
was
no
room
for
a
seat
only
room
for
some
civil
gentleman
to
take
away
full
cups
and
bring
them
back
empty
dorothy
was
not
sufficiently
to
see
the
danger
of
this
position
till
gibson
had
seated
himself
in
the
chair
then
it
did
seem
cruel
to
her
that
she
should
be
thus
besieged
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
as
she
had
been
also
at
dinner
while
the
tea
was
being
consumed
gibson
assisted
at
the
service
asking
ladies
whether
they
would
have
cake
or
bread
and
butter
but
when
all
that
was
over
dorothy
was
still
in
her
prison
and
gibson
was
still
the
jailer
at
the
gate
she
soon
perceived
that
everybody
else
was
chatting
and
laughing
and
that
brooke
burgess
was
the
centre
of
a
little
circle
which
had
formed
itself
quite
at
a
distance
from
her
seat
once
twice
thrice
she
meditated
an
escape
but
she
had
not
the
courage
to
make
the
attempt
she
did
not
know
how
to
manage
it
she
was
conscious
that
her
aunt
eye
was
upon
her
and
that
her
aunt
would
expect
her
to
listen
to
gibson
at
last
she
gave
up
all
hope
of
moving
and
was
anxious
simply
that
gibson
should
confine
himself
to
the
dirt
of
the
paths
and
the
noble
prospect
from
haldon
hill
i
think
we
shall
have
more
rain
before
we
are
done
with
it
he
said
twice
before
during
the
evening
he
had
been
very
eloquent
about
the
rain
i
dare
say
we
shall
said
dorothy
and
then
there
came
the
sound
of
loud
laughter
from
sir
peter
and
dorothy
could
see
that
he
was
poking
brooke
burgess
in
the
ribs
there
had
never
been
anything
so
gay
before
since
she
had
been
in
exeter
and
now
she
was
hemmed
up
in
that
corner
away
from
it
all
by
gibson
this
burgess
seems
to
be
different
from
the
other
burgesses
said
gibson
i
think
he
must
be
very
clever
said
dorothy
well
yes
in
a
sort
of
a
way
what
people
call
a
merry
andrew
i
like
people
who
make
me
laugh
and
laugh
themselves
said
dorothy
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
laughter
is
a
very
good
thing
in
its
place
i
am
not
at
all
one
of
those
who
would
make
the
world
altogether
grave
there
are
serious
things
and
there
must
be
serious
moments
of
course
said
dorothy
and
i
think
that
serious
conversation
upon
the
whole
has
more
allurements
than
conversation
which
when
you
come
to
examine
it
is
found
to
mean
nothing
do
you
i
suppose
everybody
should
mean
something
when
he
talks
just
so
that
is
exactly
my
idea
said
gibson
on
all
such
subjects
as
that
i
should
be
so
sorry
if
you
and
i
did
not
agree
i
really
should
then
he
paused
and
dorothy
was
so
confounded
by
what
she
conceived
to
be
the
dangers
of
the
coming
moment
that
she
was
unable
even
to
think
what
she
ought
to
say
she
heard
clear
sharp
merry
voice
and
she
heard
her
aunt
tone
of
pretended
anger
and
she
heard
sir
peter
continued
laughter
and
brooke
burgess
as
he
continued
the
telling
of
some
story
but
her
own
trouble
was
too
great
to
allow
of
her
attending
to
what
was
going
on
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
there
is
nothing
as
to
which
i
am
so
anxious
as
that
you
and
i
should
agree
about
serious
things
said
gibson
i
suppose
we
do
agree
about
going
to
church
said
dorothy
she
knew
that
she
could
have
made
no
speech
more
stupid
more
senseless
more
inefficacious
but
what
was
she
to
say
in
answer
to
such
an
assurance
i
hope
so
said
gibson
and
i
think
so
your
aunt
is
a
most
excellent
woman
and
her
opinion
has
very
great
weight
with
me
on
all
subjects
even
as
to
matters
of
church
discipline
and
doctrine
in
which
as
a
clergyman
i
am
of
course
presumed
to
be
more
at
home
but
your
aunt
is
a
woman
among
a
thousand
of
course
i
think
she
is
very
good
and
she
is
so
right
about
this
young
man
and
her
property
do
you
think
so
quite
right
mr
gibson
because
you
know
to
you
of
course
being
her
near
relative
and
the
one
she
has
singled
out
as
the
recipient
of
her
kindness
it
might
have
been
cause
for
some
discontent
discontent
to
me
mr
gibson
i
am
quite
sure
your
feelings
are
what
they
ought
to
be
and
for
myself
if
i
ever
were
that
is
to
say
supposing
i
could
be
in
any
way
interested
but
perhaps
it
is
premature
to
make
any
suggestion
on
that
head
at
present
i
do
at
all
understand
what
you
mean
mr
gibson
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
might
take
this
opportunity
of
expressing
but
after
all
the
levity
of
the
moment
is
hardly
in
accordance
with
the
sentiments
which
i
should
wish
to
express
i
think
that
i
ought
to
go
to
my
aunt
now
gibson
as
perhaps
she
might
want
something
then
she
did
push
back
her
chair
and
stand
upon
her
legs
and
gibson
after
pausing
for
a
moment
allowed
her
to
escape
soon
after
that
the
visitors
went
and
brooke
burgess
was
left
in
the
with
miss
stanbury
and
dorothy
how
well
i
recollect
all
the
people
said
brooke
sir
peter
and
old
machugh
and
powel
who
then
used
to
be
called
the
beautiful
miss
noel
and
i
remember
every
bit
of
furniture
in
the
room
nothing
changed
except
the
old
woman
brooke
said
miss
stanbury
upon
my
word
you
are
the
least
changed
of
all
except
that
you
do
seem
to
be
so
terrible
as
you
were
then
was
i
very
terrible
brooke
my
mother
had
told
me
i
fancy
that
i
was
never
to
make
a
noise
and
be
sure
not
to
break
any
of
the
china
you
were
always
very
and
when
you
gave
me
a
silver
watch
i
could
hardly
believe
the
extent
of
my
own
bliss
you
would
care
about
a
watch
from
an
old
woman
now
brooke
you
try
me
but
what
rakes
you
are
here
it
past
eleven
and
i
must
go
and
have
a
smoke
have
a
what
said
miss
stanbury
with
a
startled
air
a
smoke
you
need
be
frightened
i
do
mean
in
the
house
no
i
hope
you
do
mean
that
but
i
may
take
a
turn
round
the
close
with
a
pipe
may
i
i
suppose
all
young
men
do
smoke
now
said
miss
stanbury
sorrowfully
every
one
of
them
and
they
tell
me
that
the
young
women
mean
to
take
to
it
before
long
if
i
saw
a
young
woman
smoking
i
should
blush
for
my
sex
and
though
she
were
the
nearest
and
dearest
that
i
had
i
would
never
speak
to
her
never
dorothy
i
do
think
gibson
smokes
i
sure
i
do
know
aunt
i
hope
he
does
i
do
hope
that
he
does
not
i
can
not
understand
what
pleasure
it
is
that
men
take
in
making
chimneys
of
themselves
and
going
about
smelling
so
that
no
one
can
bear
to
come
near
them
brooke
merely
laughed
at
this
and
went
his
way
and
smoked
his
pipe
out
in
the
close
while
martha
sat
up
to
let
him
in
when
he
had
finished
it
then
dorothy
escaped
at
once
to
her
room
fearful
of
being
questioned
by
her
aunt
about
gibson
she
had
she
thought
now
quite
made
up
her
mind
there
was
nothing
in
gibson
that
she
liked
she
was
by
no
means
so
sure
as
she
had
been
when
she
was
talking
to
her
sister
that
she
would
prefer
a
clergyman
to
any
one
else
she
had
formed
no
strong
ideas
on
the
subject
of
but
she
did
think
that
any
man
who
really
cared
for
her
would
find
some
other
way
of
expressing
his
love
than
that
which
gibson
had
adopted
and
then
gibson
had
spoken
to
her
about
her
aunt
money
in
a
way
that
was
distasteful
to
her
she
thought
that
she
was
quite
sure
that
if
he
should
ask
her
she
would
not
accept
him
she
was
nearly
undressed
nearly
safe
for
the
night
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
her
aunt
entered
the
room
he
has
come
in
said
miss
stanbury
i
suppose
he
has
had
his
pipe
then
i
wish
he
did
smoke
i
do
wish
he
did
smoke
but
i
suppose
an
old
woman
like
me
is
only
making
herself
a
fool
to
care
about
such
things
if
they
all
do
it
i
ca
prevent
them
he
seems
to
be
a
very
nice
young
man
in
other
things
does
he
not
dolly
very
nice
indeed
aunt
stanbury
and
he
has
done
very
well
in
his
office
and
as
for
his
saying
that
he
must
smoke
i
like
that
a
great
deal
better
than
doing
it
on
the
sly
i
do
think
burgess
would
do
anything
on
the
sly
aunt
no
no
i
do
think
he
would
dear
me
he
not
at
all
like
what
i
fancied
everybody
seemed
to
like
him
very
much
did
they
i
never
saw
sir
peter
so
much
taken
and
there
was
quite
a
flirtation
between
him
and
machugh
and
now
my
dear
tell
me
about
mr
gibson
there
is
nothing
to
tell
aunt
stanbury
is
there
from
what
i
saw
going
on
i
thought
there
would
be
something
to
tell
he
was
talking
to
you
the
whole
evening
as
it
happened
he
was
sitting
next
to
me
of
course
indeed
he
was
sitting
next
to
you
so
much
so
that
i
thought
everything
would
be
settled
if
i
tell
you
something
aunt
stanbury
you
must
be
angry
with
me
tell
me
what
what
is
it
you
have
to
tell
me
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
care
for
gibson
not
in
that
way
why
not
dorothy
i
sure
he
does
care
for
me
and
i
do
think
he
means
it
i
tell
you
he
does
mean
it
mean
it
why
i
tell
you
it
has
all
been
settled
between
us
since
i
first
spoke
to
you
i
have
explained
to
him
exactly
what
i
intend
to
do
he
knows
that
he
can
give
up
his
house
and
come
and
live
here
i
am
sure
he
must
have
said
something
about
it
to
you
not
a
word
aunt
stanbury
then
he
will
dear
aunt
i
do
so
wish
you
would
prevent
it
i
do
like
him
i
do
indeed
not
like
him
no
i
do
care
for
him
a
bit
and
i
never
shall
i
ca
help
it
aunt
stanbury
i
thought
i
would
try
but
i
find
it
would
be
impossible
you
ca
want
me
to
marry
a
man
if
i
do
love
him
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
not
love
him
and
why
should
you
love
him
he
a
gentleman
everybody
respects
him
he
have
plenty
to
make
you
comfortable
all
your
life
and
then
why
did
you
tell
me
before
i
did
know
aunt
stanbury
i
thought
that
perhaps
perhaps
what
i
could
not
say
all
at
once
that
i
did
care
for
him
when
i
had
never
so
much
as
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
before
you
have
told
him
this
no
i
have
not
told
him
i
could
begin
by
telling
him
you
know
then
i
must
pray
that
you
will
think
about
it
again
have
you
imagined
what
a
great
thing
for
you
it
would
be
to
be
established
for
life
so
that
you
should
never
have
any
more
trouble
again
about
a
home
or
about
money
or
anything
do
answer
me
now
dorothy
but
think
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
doing
such
an
excellent
thing
for
both
of
you
so
saying
miss
stanbury
left
the
room
and
dorothy
was
enabled
to
obey
her
at
any
rate
in
one
matter
she
did
think
of
it
she
laid
awake
thinking
of
it
almost
all
the
night
but
the
more
she
thought

chapter

the
full
moon
at
diddulph
the
receipt
of
trevelyan
letter
on
that
monday
morning
was
a
great
surprise
both
to
and
outhouse
there
was
no
time
for
any
consideration
no
opportunity
for
delaying
their
arrival
till
they
should
have
again
referred
the
matter
to
trevelyan
their
two
nieces
were
to
be
with
them
on
that
evening
and
even
the
telegraph
wires
if
employed
with
such
purpose
would
not
be
quick
enough
to
stop
their
coming
the
party
as
they
knew
would
have
left
nuncombe
putney
before
the
arrival
of
the
letter
at
the
parsonage
of
diddulph
there
would
have
been
nothing
in
this
to
have
caused
vexation
had
it
not
been
decided
between
trevelyan
and
outhouse
that
trevelyan
was
not
to
find
a
home
at
the
parsonage
outhouse
was
greatly
afraid
of
being
so
entangled
in
the
matter
as
to
be
driven
to
take
the
part
of
the
wife
against
the
husband
and
outhouse
though
she
was
full
of
indignation
against
trevelyan
was
at
the
same
time
not
free
from
anger
in
regard
to
her
own
niece
she
more
than
once
repeated
that
most
unjust
of
all
proverbs
which
declares
that
there
is
never
smoke
without
fire
and
asserted
broadly
that
she
did
not
like
to
be
with
people
who
could
not
live
at
home
husbands
with
wives
and
wives
with
husbands
in
a
decent
respectable
manner
nevertheless
the
preparations
went
on
busily
and
when
the
party
arrived
at
seven
in
the
evening
two
rooms
had
been
prepared
close
to
each
other
one
for
the
two
sisters
and
the
other
for
the
child
and
nurse
although
poor
outhouse
himself
was
turned
out
of
his
own
little
chamber
in
order
that
the
accommodation
might
be
given
they
were
all
very
hot
very
tired
and
very
dusty
when
the
cab
reached
the
parsonage
there
had
been
the
preliminary
drive
from
nuncombe
putney
to
lessboro
then
the
railway
journey
from
thence
to
the
waterloo
bridge
station
had
been
long
and
it
had
seemed
to
them
that
the
distance
from
the
station
to
had
been
endless
when
the
cabman
was
told
whither
he
was
to
go
he
looked
doubtingly
at
his
poor
old
horse
and
then
at
the
luggage
which
he
was
required
to
pack
on
the
top
of
his
cab
and
laid
himself
out
for
his
work
with
a
full
understanding
that
it
would
not
be
accomplished
without
considerable
difficulty
the
cabman
made
it
twelve
miles
from
waterloo
bridge
to
diddulph
and
suggested
that
extra
passengers
and
parcels
would
make
the
fare
up
to
ten
and
six
had
he
named
double
as
much
trevelyan
would
have
assented
so
great
was
the
fatigue
and
so
wretched
the
occasion
that
there
was
sobbing
and
crying
in
the
cab
and
when
at
last
the
parsonage
was
reached
even
the
nurse
was
hardly
able
to
turn
her
hand
to
anything
the
poor
wanderers
were
made
welcome
on
that
evening
without
a
word
of
discussion
as
to
the
cause
of
their
coming
i
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
us
uncle
oliphant
emily
trevelyan
had
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
angry
with
you
my
dear
for
coming
to
our
house
how
could
i
be
angry
with
you
then
the
travellers
were
hurried
by
outhouse
and
the
master
of
the
parsonage
was
left
alone
for
a
while
he
certainly
was
not
angry
but
he
was
ill
at
ease
and
unhappy
his
guests
would
probably
remain
with
him
for
six
or
seven
months
he
had
resolutely
refused
all
payment
from
trevelyan
but
nevertheless
he
was
a
poor
man
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
that
a
clergyman
in
such
a
parish
as
diddulph
without
a
private
income
should
not
be
a
poor
man
it
was
but
a
existence
which
he
lived
paying
his
way
as
his
money
came
to
him
and
sharing
the
proceeds
of
his
parish
with
the
poor
he
was
always
more
or
less
in
debt
that
was
quite
understood
among
the
tradesmen
and
the
butcher
who
trusted
him
though
he
was
a
bad
churchman
did
not
look
upon
the
parson
account
as
he
did
on
other
debts
he
would
often
hint
to
outhouse
that
a
little
money
ought
to
be
paid
and
then
a
little
money
would
be
paid
but
it
was
never
expected
that
the
parsonage
bill
should
be
settled
in
such
a
household
the
arrival
of
four
guests
who
were
expected
to
remain
for
an
almost
indefinite
number
of
months
could
not
be
regarded
without
dismay
on
that
first
evening
emily
and
nora
did
come
down
to
tea
but
they
went
up
again
to
their
rooms
almost
immediately
afterwards
and
outhouse
found
that
many
hours
of
solitary
meditation
were
allowed
to
him
on
the
occasion
i
suppose
your
brother
has
been
told
all
about
it
he
said
to
his
wife
as
soon
as
they
were
together
on
that
evening
yes
he
has
been
told
she
did
not
write
to
her
mother
till
after
she
had
got
to
nuncombe
putney
she
did
not
like
to
speak
about
her
troubles
while
there
was
a
hope
that
things
might
be
made
smooth
you
ca
blame
her
for
that
my
dear
but
there
was
a
month
lost
or
nearly
letters
go
only
once
a
month
and
now
they
ca
hear
from
marmaduke
or
bessy
lady
rowley
name
was
bessy
till
the
beginning
of
september
that
will
be
in
a
fortnight
but
what
can
my
brother
say
to
them
he
will
suppose
that
they
are
still
down
in
devonshire
you
do
think
he
will
come
at
once
how
can
he
my
dear
he
ca
come
without
leave
and
the
expense
would
be
ruinous
they
would
stop
his
pay
and
there
would
be
all
manner
of
evils
he
is
to
come
in
the
spring
and
they
must
stay
here
till
he
comes
the
parson
of
diddulph
sighed
and
groaned
would
it
not
have
been
almost
better
that
he
should
have
put
his
pride
in
his
pocket
and
have
consented
to
take
money
on
the
second
morning
hugh
stanbury
called
at
the
parsonage
and
was
closeted
for
a
while
with
the
parson
nora
had
heard
his
voice
in
the
passage
and
every
one
in
the
house
knew
who
it
was
that
was
talking
to
outhouse
in
the
little
back
parlour
that
was
called
a
study
nora
was
full
of
anxiety
would
he
ask
to
see
them
to
see
her
and
why
was
he
there
so
long
no
doubt
he
has
brought
a
message
from
trevelyan
said
her
sister
i
dare
say
he
will
send
word
that
i
ought
not
to
have
come
to
my
uncle
house
then
at
last
both
outhouse
and
hugh
stanbury
came
into
the
room
in
which
they
were
all
sitting
the
greetings
were
cold
and
unsatisfactory
and
nora
barely
allowed
hugh
to
touch
the
tip
of
her
fingers
she
was
very
angry
with
him
and
yet
she
knew
that
her
anger
was
altogether
unreasonable
that
he
had
caused
her
to
refuse
a
marriage
that
had
so
much
to
attract
her
was
not
his
sin
not
that
but
that
having
thus
overpowered
her
by
his
influence
he
should
then
have
stopped
and
yet
nora
had
told
herself
twenty
times
that
it
was
quite
impossible
that
she
should
become
hugh
stanbury
wife
and
that
were
hugh
stanbury
to
ask
her
it
would
become
her
to
be
indignant
with
him
for
daring
to
make
a
proposition
so
outrageous
and
now
she
was
sick
at
heart
because
he
did
not
speak
to
her
he
had
of
course
come
to
diddulph
with
a
message
from
trevelyan
and
his
secret
was
soon
told
to
them
all
trevelyan
himself
was
in
the
sanded
parlour
of
the
full
moon
round
the
corner
trevelyan
when
she
heard
this
clasped
her
hands
and
bit
her
lips
what
was
he
there
for
if
he
wanted
to
see
her
why
did
he
not
come
boldly
to
the
parsonage
but
it
soon
appeared
that
he
had
no
desire
to
see
his
wife
i
am
to
take
louey
to
him
said
hugh
stanbury
if
you
will
allow
me
what
to
be
taken
away
from
me
exclaimed
the
mother
but
hugh
assured
her
that
no
such
idea
had
been
formed
that
he
would
have
concerned
himself
in
no
such
stratagem
and
that
he
would
himself
undertake
to
bring
the
boy
back
again
within
an
hour
emily
was
of
course
anxious
to
be
informed
what
other
message
was
to
be
conveyed
to
her
but
there
was
no
other
message
no
message
either
of
love
or
of
instruction
stanbury
said
the
parson
has
left
something
in
my
hands
for
you
this
something
was
given
over
to
her
as
soon
as
stanbury
had
left
the
house
and
consisted
of
cheques
for
various
small
sums
amounting
in
all
to
and
he
has
said
what
i
am
to
do
with
it
emily
asked
of
her
uncle
outhouse
declared
that
the
cheques
had
been
given
to
him
without
any
instructions
on
that
head
trevelyan
had
simply
expressed
his
satisfaction
that
his
wife
should
be
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
had
sent
the
money
and
had
desired
to
see
the
child
the
boy
was
got
ready
and
hugh
walked
with
him
in
his
arms
round
the
corner
to
the
full
moon
he
had
to
pass
by
the
bar
and
the
barmaid
and
the
potboy
looked
at
him
very
hard
there
a
young
has
to
do
with
that
ere
little
game
said
the
potboy
and
it
two
to
one
the
young
has
the
worst
of
it
said
the
barmaid
they
mostly
does
said
the
potboy
not
without
some
feeling
of
pride
in
the
immunities
of
his
sex
here
he
is
said
hugh
as
he
entered
the
parlour
my
boy
there
papa
the
child
at
this
time
was
more
than
a
year
old
and
could
crawl
about
and
use
his
own
legs
with
the
assistance
of
a
finger
to
his
little
hand
and
could
utter
a
sound
which
the
fond
mother
interpreted
to
mean
papa
for
with
all
her
hot
anger
against
her
husband
the
mother
was
above
all
things
anxious
that
her
child
should
be
taught
to
love
his
father
name
she
would
talk
of
her
separation
from
her
husband
as
though
it
must
be
permanent
she
would
declare
to
her
sister
how
impossible
it
was
that
they
should
ever
again
live
together
she
would
repeat
to
herself
over
and
over
the
tale
of
the
injustice
that
had
been
done
to
her
assuring
herself
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
ever
pardon
the
man
but
yet
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
there
was
a
hope
that
the
quarrel
should
be
healed
before
her
boy
would
be
old
enough
to
understand
the
nature
of
quarrelling
trevelyan
took
the
child
on
to
his
knee
and
kissed
him
but
the
poor
little
fellow
startled
by
his
transference
from
one
male
set
of
arms
to
another
confused
by
the
strangeness
of
the
room
and
by
the
absence
of
things
familiar
to
his
sight
burst
out
into
loud
tears
he
had
stood
the
journey
round
the
corner
in
hugh
arms
manfully
and
though
he
had
looked
about
him
with
very
serious
eyes
as
he
passed
through
the
bar
he
had
borne
that
and
his
carriage
up
the
stairs
but
when
he
was
transferred
to
his
father
whose
air
as
he
took
the
boy
was
melancholy
and
lugubrious
in
the
extreme
the
poor
little
fellow
could
endure
no
longer
a
mode
of
treatment
so
unusual
and
with
a
grimace
which
for
a
moment
or
two
threatened
the
coming
storm
burst
out
with
an
infantine
howl
that
how
he
has
been
taught
said
trevelyan
illustration
the
full
moon
at
st
diddulph
nonsense
said
stanbury
he
not
been
taught
at
all
nature
nature
that
he
should
be
afraid
of
his
own
father
he
did
not
cry
when
he
was
with
you
no
as
it
happened
he
did
not
i
played
with
him
when
i
was
at
nuncombe
but
of
course
one
ca
tell
when
a
child
will
cry
and
when
it
wo
my
darling
my
dearest
my
own
son
said
trevelyan
caressing
the
child
and
trying
to
comfort
him
but
the
poor
little
fellow
only
cried
the
louder
it
was
now
nearly
two
months
since
he
had
seen
his
father
and
when
age
is
counted
by
months
only
almost
everything
may
be
forgotten
in
six
weeks
i
suppose
you
must
take
him
back
again
said
trevelyan
sadly
of
course
i
must
take
him
back
again
come
along
louey
my
boy
it
is
cruel
very
cruel
said
trevelyan
no
man
living
could
love
his
child
better
than
i
love
mine
or
for
the
matter
of
that
his
wife
it
is
very
cruel
the
remedy
is
in
your
own
hands
trevelyan
said
stanbury
as
he
marched
off
with
the
boy
in
his
arms
trevelyan
had
now
become
so
accustomed
to
being
told
by
everybody
that
he
was
wrong
and
was
at
the
same
time
so
convinced
that
he
was
right
that
he
regarded
the
perversity
of
his
friends
as
a
part
of
the
persecution
to
which
he
was
subjected
even
lady
milborough
who
objected
to
colonel
osborne
quite
as
strongly
as
did
trevelyan
himself
even
she
blamed
him
now
telling
him
that
he
had
done
wrong
to
separate
himself
from
his
wife
bideawhile
the
old
family
lawyer
was
of
the
same
opinion
trevelyan
had
spoken
to
bideawhile
as
to
the
expediency
of
making
some
lasting
arrangement
for
a
permanent
maintenance
for
his
wife
but
the
attorney
had
told
him
that
nothing
of
the
kind
could
be
held
to
be
lasting
it
was
clearly
the
husband
duty
to
look
forward
to
a
reconciliation
and
bideawhile
became
quite
severe
in
the
tone
of
rebuke
which
he
assumed
stanbury
treated
him
almost
as
though
he
were
a
madman
and
as
for
his
wife
herself
when
she
wrote
to
him
she
would
not
even
pretend
to
express
any
feeling
of
affection
and
yet
as
he
thought
no
man
had
ever
done
more
for
a
wife
when
stanbury
had
gone
with
the
child
he
sat
waiting
for
him
in
the
parlour
of
the
as
miserable
a
man
as
one
could
find
he
had
promised
himself
something
that
should
be
akin
to
pleasure
in
seeing
his
boy
but
it
had
been
all
disappointment
and
pain
what
was
it
that
they
expected
him
to
do
what
was
it
that
they
desired
his
wife
had
behaved
with
such
indiscretion
as
almost
to
have
compromised
his
honour
and
in
return
for
that
he
was
to
beg
her
pardon
confess
himself
to
have
done
wrong
and
allow
her
to
return
in
triumph
that
was
the
light
in
which
he
regarded
his
own
position
but
he
promised
to
himself
that
let
his
own
misery
be
what
it
might
he
would
never
so
degrade
him
the
only
person
who
had
been
true
to
him
was
bozzle
let
them
all
look
to
it
if
there
were
any
further
intercourse
between
his
wife
and
colonel
osborne
he
would
take
the
matter
into
open
court
and
put
her
away
publicly
let
bideawhile
say
what
he
might
bozzle
should
see
to
that
and
as
to
himself
he
would
take
himself
out
of
england
and
hide
himself
abroad
bozzle
should
know
his
address
but
he
would
give
it
to
no
one
else
nothing
on
earth
should
make
him
yield
to
a
woman
who
had
him
nothing
but
confession
and
promise
of
amendment
on
her
part
if
she
would
acknowledge
and
promise
then
he
would
forgive
all
and
the
events
of
the
last
four
months
should
never
again
be
mentioned
by
him
so
resolving
he
sat
and
waited
till
stanbury
should
return
to
him
when
stanbury
got
back
to
the
parsonage
with
the
boy
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
his
leave
he
would
fain
have
asked
permission
to
come
again
could
he
have
invented
any
reason
for
doing
so
but
the
child
was
taken
from
him
at
once
by
its
mother
and
he
was
left
alone
with
outhouse
nora
rowley
did
not
even
show
herself
and
he
hardly
knew
how
to
express
sympathy
and
friendship
for
the
guests
at
the
parsonage
without
seeming
to
be
untrue
to
his
friend
trevelyan
i
hope
all
this
may
come
to
an
end
soon
he
said
i
hope
it
may
stanbury
said
the
clergyman
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
seems
to
me
that
trevelyan
is
so
unreasonable
a
man
so
much
like
a
madman
indeed
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
look
forward
to
any
future
happiness
for
my
niece
this
was
spoken
with
the
utmost
severity
that
outhouse
could
assume
and
yet
no
man
loves
his
wife
more
tenderly
tender
love
should
show
itself
by
tender
conduct
stanbury
what
has
he
done
to
his
wife
he
has
blackened
her
name
among
all
his
friends
and
hers
he
has
turned
her
out
of
his
house
he
has
reviled
her
and
then
thinks
to
prove
how
good
he
is
by
sending
her
money
the
only
possible
excuse
is
that
he
must
be
mad
stanbury
went
back
to
the
full
moon
and
retraced
his
steps
with
his
friend
towards
lincoln
inn
two
minutes
took
him
from
the
parsonage
to
the
but
during
these
two
minutes
he
resolved
that
he
would
speak
his
mind
roundly
to
trevelyan
as
they
returned
home
trevelyan
should
either
take
his
wife
back
again
at
once
or
else
he
stanbury
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
he
said
nothing
till
they
had
threaded
together
the
maze
of
streets
which
led
them
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
church
of
diddulph
into
the
straight
way
of
the
commercial
road
then
he
began
trevelyan
said
he
you
are
wrong
in
all
this
from
beginning
to
end
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
if
there
was
anything
in
what
your
wife
did
to
offend
you
a
soft
word
from
you
would
have
put
it
all
right
a
soft
word
how
do
you
know
what
soft
words
i
used
a
soft
word
now
would
do
it
you
have
only
to
bid
her
come
back
to
you
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
all
would
be
right
ca
you
be
man
enough
to
remember
that
you
are
a
man
stanbury
i
believe
you
want
to
quarrel
with
me
i
tell
you
fairly
that
i
think
that
you
are
wrong
they
have
talked
you
over
to
their
side
i
know
nothing
about
sides
i
only
know
that
you
are
wrong
and
what
would
you
have
me
do
go
and
travel
together
for
six
months
here
was
lady
receipt
again
travel
together
for
a
year
if
you
will
then
come
back
and
live
where
you
please
people
will
have
forgotten
it
or
if
they
remember
it
what
matters
no
sane
person
can
advise
you
to
go
on
as
you
are
doing
now
but
it
was
of
no
avail
before
they
had
reached
the
bank
the
two
friends
had
quarrelled
and
had
parted
then
trevelyan
felt
that
there
was
indeed
no
one
left
to
him
but
bozzle
on
the
following
morning
he
saw
bozzle
and
on
the
evening
of
the
next
day
he
was
in
paris
chapter
xxxiii
hugh
stanbury
smokes
another
pipe
trevelyan
was
gone
and
bozzle
alone
knew
his
address
during
the
first
fortnight
of
her
residence
at
diddulph
trevelyan
received
two
letters
from
lady
milborough
in
both
of
which
she
was
recommended
indeed
tenderly
implored
to
be
submissive
to
her
husband
anything
said
lady
milborough
is
better
than
separation
in
answer
to
the
second
letter
trevelyan
told
the
old
lady
that
she
had
no
means
by
which
she
could
shew
any
submission
to
her
husband
even
if
she
were
so
minded
her
husband
had
gone
away
she
did
not
know
whither
and
she
had
no
means
by
which
she
could
communicate
with
him
and
then
came
a
packet
to
her
from
her
father
and
mother
despatched
from
the
islands
after
the
receipt
by
lady
rowley
of
the
melancholy
tidings
of
the
journey
to
nuncombe
putney
both
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
were
full
of
anger
against
trevelyan
and
wrote
as
though
the
husband
could
certainly
be
brought
back
to
a
sense
of
his
duty
if
they
only
were
present
this
packet
had
been
at
nuncombe
putney
and
contained
a
sealed
note
from
sir
marmaduke
addressed
to
trevelyan
lady
rowley
explained
that
it
was
impossible
that
they
should
get
to
england
earlier
than
in
the
spring
i
would
come
myself
at
once
and
leave
papa
to
follow
said
lady
rowley
only
for
the
children
if
i
were
to
bring
them
i
must
take
a
house
for
them
and
the
expense
would
ruin
us
papa
has
written
to
trevelyan
in
a
way
that
he
thinks
will
bring
him
to
reason
but
how
was
this
letter
by
which
the
husband
was
to
be
brought
to
reason
to
be
put
into
the
husband
hands
trevelyan
applied
to
bideawhile
and
to
lady
milborough
and
to
stanbury
for
trevelyan
address
but
was
told
by
each
of
them
that
nothing
was
known
of
his
whereabouts
she
did
not
apply
to
bozzle
although
bozzle
was
more
than
once
in
her
neighbourhood
but
as
yet
she
knew
nothing
of
bozzle
the
replies
from
bideawhile
and
from
lady
milborough
came
by
the
post
but
hugh
stanbury
thought
that
duty
required
him
to
make
another
journey
to
diddulph
and
carry
his
own
answer
with
him
and
on
this
occasion
fortune
was
either
very
kind
to
him
or
very
unkind
whichever
it
was
he
found
himself
alone
for
a
few
seconds
in
the
parsonage
parlour
with
nora
rowley
outhouse
was
away
at
the
time
emily
had
gone
for
the
boy
and
outhouse
suspecting
nothing
had
followed
her
miss
rowley
said
he
getting
up
from
his
seat
if
you
think
it
will
do
any
good
i
will
follow
trevelyan
till
i
find
him
how
can
you
find
him
besides
why
should
you
give
up
your
own
business
i
would
do
anything
to
serve
your
sister
this
he
said
with
hesitation
in
his
voice
as
though
he
did
not
dare
to
speak
all
that
he
desired
to
have
spoken
i
am
sure
that
emily
is
very
grateful
said
nora
but
she
would
not
wish
to
give
you
such
trouble
as
that
i
would
do
anything
for
your
sister
he
repeated
for
your
sake
miss
rowley
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
spoken
a
word
to
her
in
such
a
strain
and
it
would
be
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
her
heart
was
sick
for
some
such
expression
but
now
that
it
had
come
though
there
was
a
sweetness
about
it
that
was
delicious
to
her
she
was
absolutely
silenced
by
it
and
she
was
at
once
not
only
silent
but
stern
rigid
and
apparently
cold
stanbury
could
not
but
feel
as
he
looked
at
her
that
he
had
offended
her
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
as
much
said
he
but
it
is
so
stanbury
said
she
that
is
nonsense
it
is
of
my
sister
not
of
me
that
we
are
speaking
then
the
door
was
opened
and
emily
came
in
with
her
child
followed
by
her
aunt
there
was
no
other
opportunity
and
perhaps
it
was
well
for
nora
and
for
hugh
that
there
should
have
been
no
other
enough
had
been
said
to
give
her
comfort
and
more
might
have
led
to
his
discomposure
as
to
that
matter
on
which
he
was
presumed
to
have
come
to
diddulph
he
could
do
nothing
he
did
not
know
address
but
did
know
that
trevelyan
had
abandoned
the
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
and
then
he
found
himself
compelled
to
confess
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
trevelyan
and
that
they
had
parted
in
anger
on
the
day
of
their
joint
visit
to
the
east
everybody
who
knows
him
must
quarrel
with
him
said
outhouse
hugh
when
he
took
his
leave
was
treated
by
them
all
as
a
friend
who
had
been
gained
outhouse
was
gracious
to
him
trevelyan
whispered
a
word
to
him
of
her
own
trouble
if
i
can
hear
anything
of
him
you
may
be
sure
that
i
will
let
you
know
he
said
then
it
was
nora
turn
to
bid
him
adieu
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
no
word
could
be
spoken
before
others
that
should
be
of
any
avail
but
as
he
took
her
hand
in
his
he
remembered
the
reticence
of
her
fingers
on
that
former
day
and
thought
that
he
was
sure
there
was
a
difference
on
this
occasion
he
made
his
journey
back
to
the
end
of
chancery
lane
on
the
top
of
an
omnibus
and
as
he
lit
his
little
pipe
disregarding
altogether
the
scrutiny
of
the
public
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
similar
to
those
in
which
he
had
indulged
as
he
sat
smoking
on
the
corner
of
the
churchyard
wall
at
nuncombe
putney
he
declared
to
himself
that
he
did
love
this
girl
and
as
it
was
so
would
it
not
be
better
at
any
rate
more
manly
that
he
should
tell
her
so
honestly
than
go
on
groping
about
with
words
when
he
saw
her
thinking
of
her
and
yet
hardly
daring
to
go
near
her
bidding
himself
to
forget
her
although
he
knew
that
such
forgetting
was
impossible
hankering
after
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
something
of
the
tenderness
of
returned
affection
and
yet
regarding
her
as
a
prize
altogether
out
of
his
reach
why
should
she
be
out
of
his
reach
she
had
no
money
and
he
had
not
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
in
the
world
but
he
was
earning
an
income
which
would
give
them
both
shelter
and
clothes
and
bread
and
cheese
what
reader
is
there
male
or
female
of
such
stories
as
is
this
who
has
not
often
discussed
in
his
or
her
own
mind
the
different
sides
of
this
question
of
love
and
marriage
on
either
side
enough
may
be
said
by
any
arguer
to
convince
at
any
rate
himself
it
must
be
wrong
for
a
man
whose
income
is
both
insufficient
and
precarious
also
not
only
to
double
his
own
cares
and
burdens
but
to
place
the
weight
of
that
doubled
burden
on
other
shoulders
besides
his
own
on
shoulders
that
are
tender
and
soft
and
ill
adapted
to
the
carriage
of
any
crushing
weight
and
then
that
doubled
burden
that
burden
of
two
mouths
to
be
fed
of
two
backs
to
be
covered
of
two
minds
to
be
satisfied
is
so
apt
to
double
itself
again
and
again
the
two
so
speedily
become
four
and
six
and
then
there
is
the
feeling
that
that
kind
of
which
has
in
itself
something
of
the
pleasantness
of
independence
when
it
is
borne
by
a
man
alone
entails
the
miseries
of
a
and
querulous
existence
when
it
is
imposed
on
a
woman
who
has
in
her
own
home
enjoyed
the
comforts
of
affluence
as
a
man
thinks
of
all
this
if
he
chooses
to
argue
with
himself
on
that
side
there
is
enough
in
the
argument
to
make
him
feel
that
not
only
as
a
wise
man
but
as
an
honest
man
he
had
better
let
the
young
lady
alone
she
is
well
as
she
is
and
he
sees
around
him
so
many
who
have
tried
the
chances
of
marriage
and
who
are
not
well
look
at
jones
with
his
wan
worn
wife
and
his
five
children
jones
who
is
not
yet
thirty
of
whom
he
happens
to
know
that
the
wretched
man
can
not
look
his
doctor
in
the
face
and
that
the
doctor
is
as
necessary
to
the
man
house
as
is
the
butcher
what
heart
can
jones
have
for
his
work
with
such
a
burden
as
this
upon
his
shoulders
and
so
the
thinker
who
argues
on
that
side
resolves
that
the
young
lady
shall
go
her
own
way
for
him
but
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
are
equally
cogent
and
so
much
more
alluring
and
they
are
used
by
the
same
man
with
reference
to
the
same
passion
and
are
intended
by
him
to
put
himself
right
in
his
conduct
in
reference
to
the
same
dear
girl
only
the
former
line
of
thoughts
occurred
to
him
on
a
saturday
when
he
was
ending
his
week
rather
gloomily
and
this
other
way
of
thinking
on
the
same
subject
has
come
upon
him
on
a
monday
as
he
is
beginning
his
week
with
renewed
hope
does
this
young
girl
of
his
heart
love
him
and
if
so
their
affection
for
each
other
being
thus
reciprocal
is
she
not
entitled
to
an
expression
of
her
opinion
and
her
wishes
on
this
difficult
subject
and
if
she
be
willing
to
run
the
risk
and
to
encounter
the
dangers
to
do
so
on
his
behalf
because
she
is
willing
to
share
everything
with
him
is
it
becoming
in
him
a
man
to
fear
what
she
does
not
fear
if
she
be
not
willing
let
her
say
so
if
there
be
any
speaking
he
must
speak
first
but
she
is
entitled
as
much
as
he
is
to
her
own
ideas
respecting
their
great
outlook
into
the
affairs
of
the
world
and
then
is
it
not
manifestly
ordinance
that
a
man
should
live
together
with
a
woman
how
poor
a
creature
does
the
man
become
who
has
shirked
his
duty
in
this
respect
who
has
done
nothing
to
keep
the
world
going
who
has
been
willing
to
ignore
all
affection
so
that
he
might
avoid
all
burdens
and
who
has
put
into
his
own
belly
every
good
thing
that
has
come
to
him
either
by
the
earning
of
his
own
hands
or
from
the
bounty
and
industry
of
others
of
course
there
is
a
risk
but
what
excitement
is
there
in
anything
in
which
there
is
none
so
on
the
tuesday
he
speaks
his
mind
to
the
young
lady
and
tells
her
candidly
that
there
will
be
potatoes
for
the
two
of
them
sufficient
as
he
hopes
of
potatoes
but
no
more
as
a
matter
of
course
the
young
lady
replies
that
she
for
her
part
will
be
quite
content
to
take
the
parings
for
her
own
eating
then
they
rush
deliciously
into
each
other
arms
and
the
matter
is
settled
for
though
the
convictions
arising
from
the
former
line
of
argument
may
be
set
aside
as
often
as
need
be
those
reached
from
the
latter
are
generally
conclusive
that
such
a
settlement
will
always
be
better
for
the
young
gentleman
and
the
young
lady
concerned
than
one
founded
on
a
sterner
prudence
is
more
than
one
may
dare
to
say
but
we
do
feel
sure
that
that
country
will
be
most
prosperous
in
which
such
leaps
in
the
dark
are
made
with
the
greatest
freedom
our
friend
hugh
as
he
sat
smoking
on
the
of
the
omnibus
determined
that
he
would
risk
everything
if
it
were
ordained
that
prudence
should
prevail
the
prudence
should
be
hers
why
should
he
take
upon
himself
to
have
prudence
enough
for
two
seeing
that
she
was
so
very
discreet
in
all
her
bearings
then
he
remembered
the
touch
of
her
hand
which
he
still
felt
upon
his
palm
as
he
sat
handling
his
pipe
and
he
told
himself
that
after
that
he
was
bound
to
say
a
word
more
and
moreover
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
was
compelled
by
a
feeling
that
mastered
him
altogether
he
could
not
get
through
an
hour
work
without
throwing
down
his
pen
and
thinking
of
nora
rowley
it
was
his
destiny
to
love
her
and
there
was
to
his
mind
a
mean
pettifogging
secrecy
amounting
almost
to
daily
lying
in
his
thus
loving
her
and
not
telling
her
that
he
loved
her
it
might
well
be
that
she
should
rebuke
him
but
he
thought
that
he
could
bear
that
it
might
well
be
that
he
had
altogether
mistaken
that
touch
of
her
hand
after
all
it
had
been
the
slightest
possible
motion
of
no
more
than
one
finger
but
he
would
at
any
rate
know
the
truth
if
she
would
tell
him
at
once
that
she
did
not
care
for
him
he
thought
that
he
could
get
over
it
but
life
was
not
worth
having
while
he
lived
in
this
shifty
dubious
and
uncomfortable
state
so
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
to
diddulph
with
his
heart
in
his
hand
in
the
mean
time
bozzle
had
been
twice
to
diddulph
and
now
he
made
a
third
journey
there
two
days
after
stanbury
visit
trevelyan
who
in
truth
hated
the
sight
of
the
man
and
who
suffered
agonies
in
his
presence
had
nevertheless
taught
himself
to
believe
that
he
could
not
live
without
his
assistance
that
it
should
be
so
was
a
part
of
the
cruelty
of
his
lot
who
else
was
there
that
he
could
trust
his
wife
had
renewed
her
intimacy
with
colonel
osborne
the
moment
that
she
had
left
him
stanbury
who
had
been
represented
to
him
as
the
most
correct
of
matrons
had
at
once
been
false
to
him
and
to
her
trust
in
allowing
colonel
osborne
to
enter
her
house
and
outhouse
with
whom
his
wife
had
now
located
herself
not
by
his
orders
were
of
course
his
enemies
his
old
friend
hugh
stanbury
had
gone
over
to
the
other
side
and
had
quarrelled
with
him
purposely
with
malice
prepense
because
he
would
not
submit
himself
to
the
caprices
of
the
wife
who
had
injured
him
his
own
lawyer
had
refused
to
act
for
him
and
his
fast
and
oldest
ally
the
very
person
who
had
sounded
in
his
ear
the
earliest
warning
note
against
that
odious
villain
whose
daily
work
it
was
to
destroy
the
peace
of
families
even
lady
milborough
had
turned
against
him
because
he
would
not
follow
the
stupid
prescription
which
she
with
obstinacy
persisted
in
giving
because
he
would
not
carry
his
wife
off
to
naples
she
was
and
inconsistent
enough
to
tell
him
that
he
was
wrong
who
was
then
left
to
him
but
bozzle
bozzle
was
very
disagreeable
bozzle
said
things
and
made
suggestions
to
him
which
were
as
bad
as
pins
stuck
into
his
flesh
but
bozzle
was
true
to
his
employer
and
could
find
out
facts
had
it
not
been
for
bozzle
he
would
have
known
nothing
of
the
journey
to
devonshire
had
it
not
been
for
bozzle
he
would
never
have
heard
of
the
correspondence
and
therefore
when
he
left
london
he
gave
bozzle
a
roving
commission
and
when
he
went
to
paris
and
from
paris
onwards
over
the
alps
into
italy
he
furnished
bozzle
with
his
address
at
this
time
in
the
midst
of
all
his
misery
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
inquire
of
himself
whether
it
might
be
possible
that
his
old
friends
were
right
and
that
he
himself
was
wrong
from
morning
to
night
he
sang
to
himself
melancholy
silent
songs
of
inward
wailing
as
to
the
cruelty
of
his
own
lot
in
life
and
in
the
mean
time
he
employed
bozzle
to
find
out
for
him
how
far
that
cruelty
was
carried
bozzle
was
of
course
convinced
that
the
lady
whom
he
was
employed
to
watch
was
no
better
than
she
ought
to
be
that
is
the
usual
bozzlian
language
for
broken
vows
secrecy
intrigue
dirt
and
adultery
it
was
his
business
to
obtain
evidence
of
her
guilt
there
was
no
question
to
be
solved
as
to
her
innocency
the
bozzlian
mind
would
have
regarded
any
such
suggestion
as
the
product
of
a
green
softness
the
possession
of
which
would
have
made
him
quite
unfit
for
his
profession
he
was
aware
that
ladies
who
are
no
better
than
they
should
be
are
often
very
clever
so
clever
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
the
bozzles
who
shall
at
last
confound
them
should
be
bozzles
bozzles
quite
at
the
top
of
their
profession
and
therefore
he
went
about
his
work
with
great
industry
and
much
caution
colonel
osborne
was
at
the
present
moment
in
scotland
bozzle
was
sure
of
that
he
was
quite
in
the
north
of
scotland
bozzle
had
examined
his
map
and
had
found
that
wick
which
was
the
colonel
was
very
far
north
indeed
he
had
half
a
mind
to
run
down
to
wick
as
he
was
possessed
by
a
certain
honest
zeal
which
made
him
long
to
do
something
hard
and
laborious
but
his
experience
told
him
that
it
was
very
easy
for
the
colonel
to
come
up
to
the
neighbourhood
of
diddulph
whereas
the
lady
could
not
go
down
to
wick
unless
she
were
to
decide
upon
throwing
herself
into
her
lover
arms
whereby
bozzle
work
would
be
brought
to
an
end
he
therefore
confined
his
immediate
operations
to
diddulph
he
made
acquaintance
with
one
or
two
important
persons
in
and
about
outhouse
parsonage
he
became
very
familiar
with
the
postman
he
arranged
terms
of
intimacy
i
am
sorry
to
say
with
the
housemaid
and
on
the
third
journey
he
made
an
alliance
with
the
potboy
at
the
full
moon
the
potboy
remembered
well
the
fact
of
the
child
being
brought
to
our
as
he
called
the
full
moon
and
he
was
enabled
to
say
that
the
same
gent
as
had
brought
the
boy
backards
and
forrards
had
since
that
been
at
the
parsonage
but
bozzle
was
quite
quick
enough
to
perceive
that
all
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
colonel
he
was
led
indeed
to
fear
that
his
governor
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
calling
trevelyan
in
his
soliloquies
that
his
governor
was
not
as
true
to
him
as
he
was
to
his
governor
what
business
had
that
meddling
fellow
stanbury
at
st
diddulph
for
trevelyan
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
tell
his
satellite
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
friend
bozzle
was
grieved
in
his
mind
when
he
learned
that
stanbury
interference
was
still
to
be
dreaded
and
wrote
to
his
governor
rather
severely
to
that
effect
but
when
so
writing
he
was
able
to
give
no
further
information
facts
in
such
cases
will
not
unravel
themselves
without
much
patience
on
the
part
of
the
investigators
chapter
xxxiv
priscilla
wisdom
illustration
on
the
night
after
the
dinner
party
in
the
close
dorothy
was
not
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
laid
awake
thinking
of
what
had
taken
place
miss
stanbury
also
was
full
of
anxiety
and
for
hour
after
hour
could
not
sleep
as
she
remembered
the
fruitlessness
of
her
efforts
on
behalf
of
her
nephew
and
niece
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
when
she
had
first
proposed
to
herself
that
dorothy
should
become
gibson
that
dorothy
herself
would
have
any
objection
to
such
a
step
in
life
her
fear
had
been
that
dorothy
would
have
become
with
triumph
at
the
idea
of
having
a
husband
and
going
to
that
husband
with
a
fortune
of
her
own
that
gibson
might
hesitate
she
had
thought
very
likely
it
is
thus
in
general
that
women
regard
the
feelings
desires
and
aspirations
of
other
women
you
will
hardly
ever
meet
an
elderly
lady
who
will
not
speak
of
her
juniors
as
living
in
a
state
of
breathless
anxiety
to
catch
husbands
and
the
elder
lady
will
speak
of
the
younger
as
though
any
kind
of
choice
in
such
catching
was
quite
disregarded
the
man
must
be
a
gentleman
or
at
least
gentlemanlike
and
there
must
be
bread
let
these
things
be
given
and
what
girl
wo
jump
into
what
man
arms
female
reader
is
it
not
thus
that
the
elders
of
your
sex
speak
of
the
younger
when
old
stanbury
heard
that
nora
rowley
had
refused
glascock
the
thing
was
to
her
unintelligible
and
it
was
now
quite
unintelligible
to
miss
stanbury
that
dorothy
should
prefer
a
single
life
to
matrimony
with
gibson
it
must
be
acknowledged
on
aunt
stanbury
behalf
that
dorothy
was
one
of
those
yielding
hesitating
submissive
young
women
trusting
others
but
doubting
ever
of
themselves
as
to
whom
it
is
natural
that
their
stronger
friends
should
find
it
expedient
to
decide
for
them
miss
stanbury
was
almost
justified
in
thinking
that
unless
she
were
to
find
a
husband
for
her
niece
her
niece
would
never
find
one
for
herself
dorothy
would
drift
into
being
an
old
maid
like
priscilla
simply
because
she
would
never
assert
herself
never
put
her
best
foot
foremost
aunt
stanbury
had
therefore
taken
upon
herself
to
put
out
a
foot
and
having
carefully
found
that
gibson
was
willing
had
conceived
that
all
difficulties
were
over
she
would
be
enabled
to
do
her
duty
by
her
niece
and
establish
comfortably
in
life
at
any
rate
one
of
her
brother
children
and
now
dorothy
was
taking
upon
herself
to
say
that
she
did
not
like
the
gentleman
such
conduct
was
almost
equal
to
writing
for
a
penny
newspaper
on
the
following
morning
after
breakfast
when
brooke
burgess
was
gone
out
to
call
upon
his
uncle
which
he
insisted
upon
doing
openly
and
not
under
the
rose
in
spite
of
miss
stanbury
great
gravity
on
the
occasion
there
was
a
very
serious
conversation
and
poor
dorothy
had
found
herself
to
be
almost
silenced
she
did
argue
for
a
time
but
her
arguments
seemed
even
to
herself
to
amount
to
so
little
why
should
she
love
gibson
that
was
a
question
which
she
found
it
impossible
to
answer
and
though
she
did
not
actually
yield
though
she
did
not
say
that
she
would
accept
the
man
still
when
she
was
told
that
three
days
were
to
be
allowed
to
her
for
consideration
and
that
then
the
offer
would
be
made
to
her
in
form
she
felt
that
as
regarded
the
interest
she
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
upon
why
should
not
such
an
insignificant
creature
as
was
she
love
gibson
or
any
other
man
who
had
bread
to
give
her
and
was
in
some
degree
like
a
gentleman
on
that
night
she
wrote
the
following
letter
to
her
sister
the
close
tuesday
dearest
priscilla
i
do
so
wish
that
you
could
be
with
me
so
that
i
could
talk
to
you
again
aunt
stanbury
is
the
most
affectionate
and
kindest
friend
in
the
world
but
she
has
always
been
so
able
to
have
her
own
way
because
she
is
both
clever
and
good
that
i
find
myself
almost
like
a
baby
with
her
she
has
been
talking
to
me
again
about
gibson
and
it
seems
that
gibson
really
does
mean
it
it
is
certainly
very
strange
but
i
do
think
now
that
it
is
true
he
is
to
come
on
friday
it
seems
very
odd
that
it
should
all
be
settled
for
him
in
that
way
but
then
aunt
stanbury
is
so
clever
at
settling
things
he
sat
next
to
me
almost
all
the
evening
yesterday
but
he
did
say
anything
about
it
except
that
he
hoped
i
agreed
with
him
about
going
to
church
and
all
that
i
suppose
i
do
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
i
were
to
be
a
clergyman
wife
i
should
endeavour
to
do
whatever
my
husband
thought
right
about
religion
one
ought
to
try
to
do
so
even
if
the
clergyman
is
not
one
husband
burgess
has
come
and
he
was
so
very
amusing
all
the
evening
that
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
gibson
said
so
little
burgess
is
a
very
nice
man
and
i
think
aunt
stanbury
is
more
fond
of
him
than
of
anybody
he
is
not
at
all
the
sort
of
person
that
i
expected
but
if
gibson
does
come
on
friday
and
does
really
mean
it
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
aunt
stanbury
will
be
very
angry
if
i
do
not
take
her
advice
i
am
quite
sure
that
she
intends
it
all
for
my
happiness
and
then
of
course
she
knows
so
much
more
about
the
world
than
i
do
she
asks
me
what
it
is
that
i
expect
of
course
i
do
not
expect
anything
it
is
a
great
compliment
from
gibson
who
is
a
clergyman
and
thought
well
of
by
everybody
and
nothing
could
be
more
respectable
aunt
stanbury
says
that
with
the
money
she
would
give
us
we
should
be
quite
comfortable
and
she
wants
us
to
live
in
this
house
she
says
that
there
are
thirty
girls
round
exeter
who
would
give
their
eyes
for
such
a
chance
and
looking
at
it
in
that
light
of
course
it
is
a
very
great
thing
for
me
only
think
how
poor
we
have
been
and
then
dear
priscilla
perhaps
he
would
let
me
be
good
to
you
and
dear
mamma
but
of
course
he
will
ask
me
whether
i
love
him
and
what
am
i
to
say
aunt
stanbury
says
that
i
am
to
love
him
begin
to
love
him
at
once
she
said
this
morning
i
would
if
i
could
partly
for
her
sake
and
because
i
do
feel
that
it
would
be
so
respectable
when
i
think
of
it
it
does
seem
such
a
pity
that
poor
i
should
throw
away
such
a
chance
and
i
must
say
that
gibson
is
very
good
and
most
obliging
and
everybody
says
that
he
has
an
excellent
temper
and
that
he
is
a
most
prudent
man
i
declare
dear
priscilla
when
i
think
of
it
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
such
a
man
should
want
me
to
be
his
wife
but
what
ought
i
to
do
i
suppose
when
a
girl
is
in
love
she
is
very
unhappy
if
the
gentleman
does
not
propose
to
her
i
am
sure
it
would
not
make
me
at
all
unhappy
if
i
were
told
that
gibson
had
changed
his
mind
dearest
priscilla
you
must
write
at
once
because
he
is
to
be
here
on
friday
oh
dear
friday
does
seem
to
be
so
near
and
i
shall
never
know
what
to
say
to
him
either
one
way
or
the
other
your
most
affectionate
sister
dorothy
stanbury
give
my
kindest
love
to
mamma
but
you
need
not
tell
her
unless
you
think
it
best
priscilla
received
this
letter
on
the
wednesday
morning
and
felt
herself
bound
to
answer
it
on
that
same
afternoon
had
she
postponed
her
reply
for
a
day
it
would
still
have
been
in
dorothy
hands
before
gibson
could
have
come
to
her
on
the
dreaded
friday
morning
but
still
that
would
hardly
give
her
time
enough
to
consider
the
matter
with
any
degree
of
deliberation
after
she
should
have
been
armed
with
what
wisdom
priscilla
might
be
able
to
send
her
the
post
left
nuncombe
putney
at
three
and
therefore
the
letter
had
to
be
written
before
their
early
dinner
so
priscilla
went
into
the
garden
and
sat
herself
down
under
an
old
cedar
that
she
might
discuss
the
matter
with
herself
in
all
its
bearings
she
felt
that
no
woman
could
be
called
upon
to
write
a
letter
that
should
be
of
more
importance
the
whole
welfare
in
life
of
the
person
who
was
dearest
to
her
would
probably
depend
upon
it
the
weight
upon
her
was
so
great
that
she
thought
for
a
while
she
would
take
counsel
with
her
mother
but
she
felt
sure
that
her
mother
would
recommend
the
marriage
and
that
if
she
afterwards
should
find
herself
bound
to
oppose
it
then
her
mother
would
be
a
miserable
woman
there
could
be
no
use
to
her
in
taking
counsel
with
her
mother
because
her
mother
mind
was
known
to
her
beforehand
the
responsibility
was
thrown
upon
her
and
she
alone
must
bear
it
she
tried
hard
to
persuade
herself
to
write
at
once
and
tell
her
sister
to
marry
the
man
she
knew
her
sister
heart
so
well
as
to
be
sure
that
dorothy
would
learn
to
love
the
man
who
was
her
husband
it
was
almost
impossible
that
dorothy
should
not
love
those
with
whom
she
lived
and
then
her
sister
was
so
well
adapted
to
be
a
wife
and
a
mother
her
temper
was
so
sweet
she
was
so
pure
so
unselfish
so
devoted
and
so
healthy
withal
she
was
so
happy
when
she
was
acting
for
others
and
so
excellent
in
action
when
she
had
another
one
to
think
for
her
she
was
so
trusting
and
trustworthy
that
any
husband
would
adore
her
then
priscilla
walked
slowly
into
the
house
got
her
and
returning
to
her
seat
under
the
tree
read
the
marriage
service
it
was
one
when
she
went
to
write
her
letter
and
it
had
not
yet
struck
eleven
when
she
first
seated
herself
beneath
the
tree
her
letter
when
written
was
as
follows
nuncombe
putney
august
dearest
dorothy
i
got
your
letter
this
morning
and
i
think
it
is
better
to
answer
it
at
once
as
the
time
is
very
short
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
with
all
my
mind
and
i
feel
almost
lest
i
should
advise
you
wrongly
after
all
i
believe
that
your
own
dear
sweet
truth
and
honesty
would
guide
you
better
than
anybody
else
can
guide
you
you
may
be
sure
of
this
that
whichever
way
it
is
i
shall
think
that
you
have
done
right
dearest
sister
i
suppose
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
for
most
women
a
married
life
is
happier
than
a
single
one
it
is
always
thought
so
as
we
may
see
by
the
anxiety
of
others
to
get
married
and
when
an
opinion
becomes
general
i
think
that
the
world
is
most
often
right
and
then
my
own
one
i
feel
sure
that
you
are
adapted
both
for
the
cares
and
for
the
joys
of
married
life
you
would
do
your
duty
as
a
married
woman
happily
and
would
be
a
comfort
to
your
husband
not
a
thorn
in
his
side
as
are
so
many
women
but
my
pet
do
not
let
that
reasoning
of
aunt
about
the
thirty
young
girls
who
would
give
their
eyes
for
gibson
have
any
weight
with
you
you
should
not
take
him
because
thirty
other
young
girls
would
be
glad
to
have
him
and
do
not
think
too
much
of
that
respectability
of
which
you
speak
i
would
never
advise
my
dolly
to
marry
any
man
unless
she
could
be
respectable
in
her
new
position
but
that
alone
should
go
for
nothing
nor
should
our
poverty
we
shall
not
starve
and
even
if
we
did
that
would
be
but
a
poor
excuse
i
can
find
no
escape
from
this
that
you
should
love
him
before
you
say
that
you
will
take
him
but
honest
loyal
love
need
not
i
take
it
be
of
that
romantic
kind
which
people
write
about
in
novels
and
poetry
you
need
not
think
him
to
be
perfect
or
the
best
or
grandest
of
men
your
heart
will
tell
you
whether
he
is
dear
to
you
and
remember
dolly
that
i
shall
remember
that
love
itself
must
begin
at
some
precise
time
though
you
had
not
learned
to
love
him
when
you
wrote
on
tuesday
you
may
have
begun
to
do
so
when
you
get
this
on
thursday
if
you
find
that
you
love
him
then
say
that
you
will
be
his
wife
if
your
heart
revolts
from
such
a
declaration
as
being
false
if
you
can
not
bring
yourself
to
feel
that
you
prefer
him
to
others
as
the
partner
of
your
life
then
tell
him
with
thanks
for
his
courtesy
that
it
can
not
be
as
he
would
have
it
yours
always
and
ever
most
affectionately

gibson
good
fortune
i
bet
you
my
lad
you
thrown
over
at
last
like
the
rest
of
them
there
nothing
she
likes
so
much
as
taking
some
one
up
in
order
that
she
may
throw
him
over
afterwards
it
was
thus
that
bartholomew
burgess
cautioned
his
nephew
brooke
i
take
care
that
she
sha
break
my
heart
uncle
barty
i
will
go
my
way
and
she
may
go
hers
and
she
may
give
her
money
to
the
hospital
if
she
pleases
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
brooke
burgess
had
declared
aloud
in
miss
stanbury
parlour
that
he
was
going
over
to
the
bank
to
see
his
uncle
now
there
was
in
this
almost
a
breach
of
contract
miss
stanbury
when
she
invited
the
young
man
to
exeter
had
stipulated
that
there
should
be
no
intercourse
between
her
house
and
the
bank
of
course
i
shall
not
need
to
know
where
you
go
or
where
you
go
she
had
written
but
after
all
that
has
passed
there
must
not
be
any
positive
intercourse
between
my
house
and
the
bank
and
now
he
had
spoken
of
going
over
to
c
and
b
as
he
called
them
with
the
utmost
indifference
miss
stanbury
had
looked
very
grave
but
had
said
nothing
she
had
determined
to
be
on
her
guard
so
that
she
should
not
be
driven
to
quarrel
with
brooke
if
she
could
avoid
it
bartholomew
burgess
was
a
tall
thin
old
man
as
in
exeter
as
the
cathedral
and
respected
after
a
fashion
no
one
liked
him
he
said
things
of
all
his
neighbours
and
had
never
earned
any
reputation
for
doing
acts
but
he
had
lived
in
exeter
for
nearly
seventy
years
and
had
achieved
that
sort
of
esteem
which
comes
from
long
tenure
and
he
had
committed
no
great
iniquities
in
the
course
of
his
fifty
years
of
business
the
bank
had
never
stopped
payment
and
he
had
robbed
no
one
he
had
not
swallowed
up
widows
and
orphans
and
had
done
his
work
in
the
firm
of
cropper
and
burgess
after
the
safe
manner
which
leads
neither
to
riches
nor
to
ruin
therefore
he
was
respected
but
he
was
a
discontented
sour
old
man
who
believed
himself
to
have
been
injured
by
all
his
own
friends
who
disliked
his
own
partners
because
they
had
bought
that
which
had
at
any
rate
never
belonged
to
him
and
whose
strongest
passion
it
was
to
hate
miss
stanbury
of
the
close
she
got
a
parson
by
the
hand
now
said
the
uncle
as
he
continued
his
caution
to
the
nephew
there
was
a
clergyman
there
last
night
no
doubt
and
she
play
him
off
against
you
and
you
against
him
and
then
she
throw
you
both
over
i
know
her
she
has
got
a
right
to
do
what
she
likes
with
her
own
uncle
barty
and
how
did
she
get
it
never
mind
i
not
going
to
set
you
against
her
if
you
her
favourite
for
the
moment
she
has
a
niece
with
her
there
has
she
one
of
her
brother
daughters
they
say
she
going
to
make
that
clergyman
marry
her
what
mr
gibson
yes
they
tell
me
he
was
as
good
as
engaged
to
another
girl
one
of
the
frenches
of
heavitree
and
therefore
dear
jemima
could
do
nothing
better
than
interfere
when
she
has
succeeded
in
breaking
the
heart
which
girl
heart
uncle
barty
the
girl
the
man
was
to
have
married
when
that
done
she
throw
gibson
over
you
see
she
refuse
to
give
the
girl
a
shilling
she
took
the
girl
brother
by
the
hand
ever
so
long
and
then
she
threw
him
over
and
she
throw
the
girl
over
too
and
send
her
back
to
the
place
she
came
from
and
then
she
throw
you
over
according
to
you
she
must
be
the
most
malicious
old
woman
that
ever
was
allowed
to
live
i
do
think
there
are
many
to
beat
her
as
far
as
malice
goes
but
you
find
out
for
yourself
i
should
be
surprised
if
she
were
to
tell
you
before
long
that
you
were
to
marry
the
niece
i
should
think
that
such
very
hard
lines
either
said
brooke
burgess
i
no
doubt
you
may
have
her
if
you
like
said
barty
in
spite
of
gibson
only
i
should
recommend
you
to
take
care
and
get
the
money
first
when
brooke
went
back
to
the
house
in
the
close
miss
stanbury
was
quite
fussy
in
her
silence
she
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
told
something
about
barty
and
above
all
to
have
learned
what
barty
had
said
about
herself
but
she
was
far
too
proud
even
to
mention
the
old
man
name
of
her
own
accord
she
was
quite
sure
that
she
had
been
abused
she
guessed
probably
with
tolerable
accuracy
the
kind
of
things
that
had
been
said
of
her
and
suggested
to
herself
what
answer
brooke
would
make
to
such
accusations
but
she
had
resolved
to
cloak
it
all
in
silence
and
pretended
for
a
while
not
to
remember
the
young
man
declared
intention
when
he
left
the
house
it
seems
odd
to
me
said
brooke
that
uncle
barty
should
always
live
alone
as
he
does
he
must
have
a
dreary
time
of
it
i
do
know
anything
about
your
uncle
barty
manner
of
living
no
i
suppose
not
you
and
he
are
not
friends
by
no
means
brooke
he
lives
there
all
alone
in
that
poky
and
nobody
ever
goes
near
him
i
wonder
whether
he
has
any
friends
in
the
city
i
really
can
not
tell
you
anything
about
his
friends
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
brooke
i
do
want
to
talk
about
your
uncle
of
course
you
can
go
to
see
him
when
you
please
but
i
rather
you
did
tell
me
of
your
visits
afterwards
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
hate
so
much
as
a
secret
said
he
he
had
no
intention
in
this
of
animadverting
upon
miss
secret
enmity
nor
had
he
purposed
to
ask
any
question
as
to
her
relations
with
the
old
man
he
had
alluded
to
his
dislike
of
having
secrets
of
his
own
but
she
misunderstood
him
if
you
are
anxious
to
know
she
said
becoming
very
red
in
the
face
i
am
not
at
all
curious
to
know
you
quite
mistake
me
he
has
chosen
to
believe
or
to
say
that
he
believed
that
i
wronged
him
in
regard
to
his
brother
will
i
nursed
his
brother
when
he
was
dying
as
i
considered
it
to
be
my
duty
to
do
i
can
not
tell
you
all
that
story
it
is
too
long
and
too
sad
romance
is
very
pretty
in
novels
but
the
romance
of
a
life
is
always
a
melancholy
matter
they
are
most
happy
who
have
no
story
to
tell
i
quite
believe
that
but
your
uncle
barty
chose
to
think
indeed
i
hardly
know
what
he
thought
he
said
that
the
will
was
a
will
of
my
making
when
it
was
made
i
and
his
brother
were
apart
we
were
not
even
on
speaking
terms
there
had
been
a
quarrel
and
all
manner
of
folly
i
am
not
very
proud
when
i
look
back
upon
it
it
is
not
that
i
think
myself
better
than
others
but
your
uncle
brooke
will
was
made
before
we
had
come
together
again
when
he
was
ill
it
was
natural
that
i
should
go
to
him
after
all
that
had
passed
between
us
eh
brooke
it
was
womanly
but
it
made
no
difference
about
the
will
bartholomew
burgess
might
have
known
that
at
once
and
must
have
known
it
afterwards
but
he
has
never
acknowledged
that
he
was
wrong
never
even
yet
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
that
i
should
say
the
will
was
no
great
triumph
to
me
i
could
have
done
without
it
as
god
is
my
judge
i
would
not
have
lifted
up
my
little
finger
to
get
either
a
part
or
the
whole
of
poor
brooke
money
if
i
had
known
that
a
word
would
have
done
it
i
would
have
bitten
my
tongue
out
before
it
should
have
been
spoken
she
had
risen
from
her
seat
and
was
speaking
with
a
solemnity
that
almost
filled
her
listener
with
awe
she
was
a
woman
short
of
stature
but
now
as
she
stood
over
him
she
seemed
to
be
tall
and
majestic
but
when
the
man
was
dead
she
continued
and
the
will
was
there
the
property
was
mine
and
i
was
bound
in
duty
to
exercise
the
privileges
and
bear
the
responsibilities
which
the
dead
man
had
conferred
upon
me
it
was
barty
then
who
sent
a
low
attorney
to
me
offering
me
a
compromise
what
had
i
to
compromise
compromise
no
if
it
was
not
mine
by
all
the
right
the
law
could
give
i
would
sooner
have
starved
than
have
had
a
crust
of
bread
out
of
the
money
she
had
now
clenched
both
her
fists
and
was
shaking
them
rapidly
as
she
stood
over
him
looking
down
upon
him
of
course
it
was
your
own
yes
though
they
asked
me
to
compromise
and
sent
messages
to
me
to
frighten
me
both
barty
and
your
uncle
tom
ay
and
your
father
too
brooke
they
did
not
dare
to
go
to
law
to
law
indeed
if
ever
there
was
a
good
will
in
the
world
the
will
of
your
uncle
brooke
was
good
they
could
talk
and
malign
me
and
tell
lies
as
to
dates
and
strive
to
make
my
name
odious
in
the
county
but
they
knew
that
the
will
was
good
they
did
not
succeed
very
well
in
what
they
did
attempt
i
would
try
to
forget
it
all
now
aunt
stanbury
forget
it
how
is
that
to
be
done
how
can
the
mind
forget
the
history
of
its
own
life
no
i
can
not
forget
it
i
can
forgive
it
then
why
not
forgive
it
i
do
i
have
why
else
are
you
here
but
forgive
old
uncle
barty
also
has
he
forgiven
me
come
now
if
i
wished
to
forgive
him
how
should
i
begin
would
he
be
gracious
if
i
went
to
him
does
he
love
me
do
you
think
or
hate
me
uncle
barty
is
a
good
hater
it
is
the
best
point
about
him
no
brooke
we
wo
try
the
farce
of
a
reconciliation
after
a
long
life
of
enmity
nobody
would
believe
us
and
we
should
not
believe
each
other
then
i
certainly
would
not
try
i
do
not
mean
to
do
so
the
truth
is
brooke
you
shall
have
it
all
when
i
gone
if
you
do
turn
against
me
you
wo
take
to
writing
for
penny
newspapers
will
you
brooke
as
she
asked
the
question
she
put
one
of
her
hands
softly
on
his
shoulder
i
certainly
sha
offend
in
that
way
and
you
wo
be
a
radical
no
not
a
radical
i
mean
a
man
to
follow
beales
and
bright
a
republican
a
of
the
church
a
hater
of
the
throne
you
wo
take
up
that
line
will
you
brooke
it
is
my
way
at
present
aunt
stanbury
but
a
man
promise
ah
me
it
makes
me
sad
when
i
think
what
the
country
is
coming
to
i
told
there
are
scores
of
members
of
parliament
who
pronounce
their
h
when
i
was
young
a
member
of
parliament
used
to
be
a
gentleman
and
they
taken
to
ordaining
all
manner
of
people
it
used
to
be
the
case
that
when
you
met
a
clergyman
you
met
a
gentleman
brooke
what
do
you
think
of
mr
gibson
gibson
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
thought
much
about
him
but
you
must
think
about
him
perhaps
you
have
thought
about
my
niece
dolly
stanbury
i
think
that
she
an
uncommonly
nice
girl
she
not
to
be
nice
for
you
young
man
she
to
be
married
to
mr
gibson
are
they
engaged
well
no
but
i
intend
that
they
shall
be
you
wo
begrudge
that
i
should
give
my
little
savings
to
one
of
my
own
name
you
do
know
me
aunt
stanbury
if
you
think
that
i
should
begrudge
anything
that
you
might
do
with
your
money
dolly
has
been
here
a
month
or
two
i
think
it
three
months
since
she
came
and
i
do
like
her
she
soft
and
womanly
and
has
taken
up
those
vile
filthy
habits
which
almost
all
the
girls
have
adopted
have
you
seen
those
frenches
with
the
things
they
have
on
their
heads
i
was
speaking
to
them
yesterday
nasty
sluts
you
can
see
the
grease
on
their
foreheads
when
they
try
to
make
their
hair
go
back
in
the
dirty
french
fashion
dolly
is
not
like
that
is
she
she
is
not
in
the
least
like
either
of
the
miss
frenches
and
now
i
want
her
to
become
gibson
he
is
quite
taken
is
he
oh
dear
yes
did
you
see
him
the
other
night
at
dinner
and
afterwards
of
course
he
knows
that
i
can
give
her
a
little
bit
of
money
which
always
goes
for
something
brooke
and
i
do
think
it
would
be
such
a
nice
thing
for
dolly
and
what
does
dolly
think
about
it
there
the
difficulty
she
likes
him
well
enough
i
sure
of
that
and
she
has
no
ideas
about
herself
she
is
one
of
those
who
think
that
almost
nothing
is
good
enough
for
them
but
she
has
an
objection
i
do
know
what
it
is
i
sometimes
think
she
is
so
bashful
and
modest
she
does
like
to
talk
of
being
married
even
to
an
old
woman
like
me
dear
me
that
not
the
way
of
the
age
is
it
aunt
stanbury
it
coming
to
that
brooke
that
the
girls
will
ask
the
men
soon
yes
and
that
they
wo
take
a
refusal
either
i
do
believe
that
camilla
french
did
ask
mr
gibson
and
what
did
gibson
say
ah
i
ca
tell
you
that
he
knows
too
well
what
he
about
to
take
her
he
to
come
here
on
friday
at
eleven
and
you
must
be
out
of
the
way
i
shall
be
out
of
the
way
too
but
if
dolly
says
a
word
to
you
before
that
mind
you
make
her
understand
that
she
ought
to
accept
gibson
she
too
good
for
him
according
to
my
thinking
do
you
be
a
fool
how
can
any
young
woman
be
too
good
for
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
gibson
is
a
gentleman
do
you
know
only
you
must
not
mention
this
that
i
have
a
kind
of
idea
that
we
could
get
nuncombe
putney
for
him
my
father
had
the
living
and
my
brother
and
i
should
like
it
to
go
on
in
the
family
no
opportunity
came
in
the
way
of
brooke
burgess
to
say
anything
in
favour
of
gibson
to
dorothy
stanbury
there
did
come
to
be
very
quickly
a
sort
of
intimacy
between
her
and
her
aunt
favourite
but
she
was
one
not
prone
to
talk
about
her
own
affairs
and
as
to
such
an
affair
as
this
a
question
as
to
whether
she
should
or
should
not
give
herself
in
marriage
to
her
suitor
she
who
could
not
speak
of
it
even
to
her
own
sister
without
a
blush
who
felt
confused
and
almost
confounded
when
receiving
her
aunt
admonitions
and
instigations
on
the
subject
would
not
have
endured
to
hear
brooke
burgess
speak
on
the
matter
dorothy
did
feel
that
a
person
easier
to
know
than
brooke
had
never
come
in
her
way
she
had
already
said
as
much
to
him
as
she
had
spoken
to
gibson
in
the
three
months
that
she
had
made
his
acquaintance
they
had
talked
about
exeter
and
about
machugh
and
the
cathedral
and
tennyson
poems
and
the
london
theatres
and
uncle
barty
and
the
family
quarrel
they
had
become
quite
confidential
with
each
other
on
some
matters
but
on
this
heavy
subject
of
gibson
and
his
proposal
of
marriage
not
a
word
had
been
said
when
brooke
once
mentioned
gibson
on
the
thursday
morning
dorothy
within
a
minute
had
taken
an
opportunity
of
escaping
from
the
room
but
circumstances
did
give
him
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
gibson
on
the
wednesday
afternoon
both
he
and
gibson
were
invited
to
drink
tea
at
french
house
on
that
evening
such
invitations
at
exeter
were
wont
to
be
given
at
short
dates
and
both
the
gentlemen
had
said
that
they
would
go
then
arabella
french
had
called
in
the
close
and
had
asked
miss
stanbury
and
dorothy
it
was
well
understood
by
arabella
that
miss
stanbury
herself
would
not
drink
tea
at
heavitree
and
it
may
be
that
dorothy
company
was
not
in
truth
desired
the
ladies
both
declined
do
you
stay
at
home
for
me
my
dear
miss
stanbury
said
to
her
niece
but
dorothy
had
not
been
out
without
her
aunt
since
she
had
been
at
exeter
and
understood
perfectly
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
commence
the
practice
at
the
house
of
the
frenches
brooke
is
coming
miss
stanbury
and
gibson
miss
french
said
and
miss
stanbury
had
thought
that
there
was
some
triumph
in
her
tone
brooke
can
go
where
he
pleases
my
dear
miss
stanbury
replied
and
as
for
gibson
i
am
not
his
keeper
the
tone
in
which
miss
stanbury
spoke
would
have
implied
great
imprudence
had
not
the
two
ladies
understood
each
other
so
thoroughly
and
had
not
each
known
that
it
was
so
there
was
the
accustomed
set
of
people
in
the
crumbies
and
the
wrights
and
the
apjohns
and
machugh
came
also
knowing
that
there
would
be
a
rubber
their
naked
shoulders
do
hurt
me
machugh
said
when
her
friend
almost
scolded
her
for
going
to
the
house
i
not
a
young
man
i
do
care
what
they
do
to
themselves
you
might
say
as
much
if
they
went
naked
altogether
miss
stanbury
had
replied
in
anger
if
nobody
else
complained
i
should
said
machugh
machugh
got
her
rubber
and
as
she
had
gone
for
her
rubber
on
a
distinct
promise
that
there
should
be
a
rubber
and
as
there
was
a
rubber
she
felt
that
she
had
no
right
to
say
things
what
does
it
matter
to
me
said
machugh
how
nasty
she
is
she
not
going
to
be
my
wife
ugh
exclaimed
miss
stanbury
shaking
her
head
both
in
anger
and
disgust
camilla
french
was
by
no
means
so
bad
as
she
was
painted
by
miss
stanbury
and
brooke
burgess
rather
liked
her
than
otherwise
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
gibson
did
not
at
all
dislike
arabella
and
felt
no
repugnance
at
either
the
lady
noddle
or
shoulders
now
that
he
was
removed
from
miss
stanbury
influence
it
was
clear
enough
also
that
arabella
had
not
given
up
the
attempt
although
she
must
have
admitted
to
herself
that
the
claims
of
dorothy
stanbury
were
very
strong
on
this
evening
it
seemed
to
have
been
specially
permitted
to
arabella
who
was
the
elder
sister
to
take
into
her
own
hands
the
management
of
the
case
beholders
of
the
game
had
hitherto
declared
that
gibson
safety
was
secured
by
the
constant
coupling
of
the
sisters
neither
would
allow
the
other
to
hunt
alone
but
a
common
sense
of
the
common
danger
had
made
some
special
strategy
necessary
and
camilla
hardly
spoke
a
word
to
gibson
during
the
evening
let
us
hope
that
she
found
some
temporary
consolation
in
the
presence
of
the
stranger
i
hope
you
are
going
to
stay
with
us
ever
so
long
mr
burgess
said
camilla
a
month
that
is
ever
so
long
is
it
why
i
mean
to
see
all
devonshire
within
that
time
i
feel
already
that
i
know
exeter
thoroughly
and
everybody
in
it
i
sure
we
are
very
much
flattered
as
for
you
miss
french
i
heard
so
much
about
you
all
my
life
that
i
felt
that
i
knew
you
before
i
came
here
who
can
have
spoken
to
you
about
me
you
forget
how
many
relatives
i
have
in
the
city
do
you
think
my
uncle
barty
never
writes
to
me
not
about
me
does
he
not
and
do
you
suppose
i
do
hear
from
miss
stanbury
but
she
hates
me
i
know
that
and
do
you
hate
her
no
indeed
i
the
greatest
respect
for
her
but
she
is
a
little
odd
is
she
now
burgess
we
all
like
her
ever
so
much
and
we
known
her
ever
so
long
six
or
seven
years
since
we
were
quite
young
things
but
she
has
such
queer
notions
about
girls
what
sort
of
notions
she
like
them
all
to
dress
just
like
herself
and
she
thinks
that
they
should
never
talk
to
young
men
if
she
was
here
she
say
i
was
flirting
with
you
because
we
sitting
together
but
you
are
not
are
you
of
course
i
am
not
i
wish
you
would
said
brooke
i
should
know
how
to
begin
i
should
indeed
i
do
know
what
flirting
means
and
i
do
know
who
does
know
when
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
go
out
i
suppose
they
are
intended
to
talk
to
each
other
but
very
often
they
do
you
know
i
call
that
stupid
said
camilla
and
yet
when
they
do
all
the
old
maids
say
that
the
girls
are
flirting
i
tell
you
one
thing
burgess
i
do
care
what
any
old
maid
says
about
me
i
always
talk
to
people
that
i
like
and
if
they
choose
to
call
me
a
flirt
they
may
it
my
opinion
that
still
waters
run
the
deepest
no
doubt
the
noisy
streams
are
very
shallow
said
brooke
you
may
call
me
a
shallow
stream
if
you
like
mr
burgess
i
meant
nothing
of
the
kind
but
what
do
you
call
dorothy
stanbury
that
what
i
call
still
water
she
runs
deep
enough
the
quietest
young
lady
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
exactly
so
quiet
but
so
clever
what
do
you
think
of
mr
gibson
everybody
is
asking
me
what
i
think
of
mr
gibson
you
know
what
they
say
they
say
he
is
to
marry
dorothy
stanbury
poor
man
i
do
think
his
own
consent
has
ever
been
asked
yet
but
nevertheless
it
settled
just
at
present
he
seems
to
me
to
be
what
shall
i
say
i
to
say
flirting
with
your
sister
ought
i
miss
stanbury
would
say
so
if
she
were
here
no
doubt
but
the
fact
is
burgess
we
known
him
almost
since
we
were
infants
and
of
course
we
take
an
interest
in
his
welfare
there
has
never
been
anything
more
than
that
arabella
is
nothing
more
to
him
than
i
am
once
indeed
but
however
that
does
not
signify
it
would
be
nothing
to
us
if
he
really
liked
dorothy
stanbury
but
as
far
as
we
can
see
and
we
do
see
a
good
deal
of
him
there
is
no
such
feeling
on
his
part
of
course
we
have
asked
we
should
not
think
of
such
a
thing
gibson
may
do
just
as
he
likes
for
us
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
dorothy
stanbury
is
just
the
girl
that
would
make
him
a
good
wife
of
course
when
you
known
a
person
seven
or
eight
years
you
do
get
anxious
about
his
happiness
do
you
know
we
think
her
perhaps
a
little
sly
in
the
meantime
gibson
was
completely
subject
to
the
individual
charms
of
arabella
camilla
had
been
quite
correct
in
a
part
of
her
description
of
their
intimacy
she
and
her
sister
had
known
gibson
for
seven
or
eight
years
but
nevertheless
the
intimacy
could
not
with
truth
be
said
to
have
commenced
during
the
infancy
of
the
young
ladies
even
if
the
word
were
used
in
its
legal
sense
seven
or
eight
years
however
is
a
long
acquaintance
and
there
was
perhaps
something
of
a
real
grievance
in
this
stanbury
intervention
if
it
be
a
recognised
fact
in
society
that
young
ladies
are
in
want
of
husbands
and
that
an
effort
on
their
part
towards
matrimony
is
not
altogether
impossible
it
must
be
recognised
also
that
failure
will
be
disagreeable
and
interference
regarded
with
animosity
miss
stanbury
the
elder
was
undoubtedly
interfering
between
gibson
and
the
frenches
and
it
is
neither
manly
nor
womanly
to
submit
to
interference
with
one
dearest
prospects
it
may
perhaps
be
admitted
that
the
miss
frenches
had
shown
too
much
open
ardour
in
their
pursuit
of
gibson
perhaps
there
should
have
been
no
ardour
and
no
pursuit
it
may
be
that
the
theory
of
womanhood
is
right
which
forbids
to
women
any
such
attempts
which
teaches
them
that
they
must
ever
be
pursued
never
the
pursuers
as
to
that
there
shall
be
no
discourse
at
present
but
it
must
be
granted
that
whenever
the
pursuit
has
been
attempted
it
is
not
in
human
nature
to
abandon
it
without
an
effort
that
the
french
girls
should
be
very
angry
with
miss
stanbury
that
they
should
put
their
heads
together
with
the
intention
of
thwarting
her
that
they
should
think
evil
things
of
poor
dorothy
that
they
should
half
despise
gibson
and
yet
resolve
to
keep
their
hold
upon
him
as
a
chattel
and
a
thing
of
value
that
was
almost
their
own
was
not
perhaps
much
to
their
discredit
you
are
a
good
deal
at
the
house
in
the
close
now
said
arabella
in
her
lowest
voice
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
was
almost
melancholy
well
yes
miss
stanbury
you
know
has
always
been
a
staunch
friend
of
mine
and
she
takes
an
interest
in
my
little
church
people
say
that
girls
are
sly
but
men
can
be
sly
too
sometimes
it
seems
that
she
has
taken
you
so
much
away
from
us
mr
gibson
i
do
know
why
you
should
say
that
miss
french
perhaps
i
am
wrong
one
is
apt
to
be
sensitive
about
one
friends
we
seem
to
have
known
you
so
well
there
is
nobody
else
in
exeter
that
mamma
regards
as
she
does
you
but
of
course
if
you
are
happy
with
miss
stanbury
that
is
everything
i
am
speaking
of
the
old
lady
said
gibson
who
in
spite
of
his
slyness
was
here
thrown
a
little
off
his
guard
and
i
am
speaking
of
the
old
lady
too
said
arabella
of
whom
else
should
i
be
speaking
no
of
course
not
of
course
continued
arabella
i
hear
what
people
say
about
the
niece
one
can
not
help
what
one
hears
you
know
gibson
but
i
do
believe
that
i
can
assure
you
as
she
said
this
she
looked
into
his
face
as
though
waiting
for
an
answer
but
gibson
had
no
answer
ready
then
arabella
told
herself
that
if
anything
was
to
be
done
it
must
be
done
at
once
what
use
was
there
in
beating
round
the
bush
when
the
only
chance
of
getting
the
game
was
to
be
had
by
dashing
at
once
into
the
thicket
i
own
i
should
be
glad
she
said
turning
her
eyes
away
from
him
if
i
could
hear
from
your
own
mouth
that
it
is
not
true
gibson
position
was
one
not
to
be
envied
were
he
willing
to
tell
the
very
secrets
of
his
soul
to
miss
french
with
the
utmost
candour
he
could
not
answer
her
question
either
one
way
or
the
other
and
he
was
not
willing
to
tell
her
any
of
his
secrets
it
was
certainly
the
fact
too
that
there
had
been
tender
passages
between
him
and
arabella
now
when
there
have
been
such
passages
and
the
gentleman
is
by
the
lady
as
gibson
was
being
at
the
present
moment
the
gentleman
usually
teaches
himself
to
think
that
a
little
falsehood
is
permissible
a
gentleman
can
hardly
tell
a
lady
that
he
has
become
tired
of
her
and
has
changed
his
mind
he
feels
the
matter
perhaps
more
keenly
even
than
she
does
and
though
at
all
other
times
he
may
be
a
very
paladin
in
the
cause
of
truth
in
such
strait
as
this
he
does
allow
himself
some
latitude
you
are
only
joking
of
course
he
said
indeed
i
am
not
joking
i
can
assure
you
gibson
that
the
welfare
of
the
friends
whom
i
really
love
can
never
be
a
matter
of
joke
to
me
crumbie
says
that
you
positively
are
engaged
to
marry
dorothy
stanbury
what
does
crumbie
know
about
it
i
dare
say
nothing
it
is
not
so
is
it
certainly
not
and
there
is
nothing
in
it
is
there
i
wonder
why
people
make
these
reports
said
gibson
prevaricating
illustration
i
wonder
why
people
make
these
reports
it
is
a
fabrication
from
beginning
to
end
then
said
arabella
pressing
the
matter
quite
home
at
this
time
she
was
very
close
to
him
and
though
her
words
were
severe
the
glance
from
her
eyes
was
soft
and
the
scent
from
her
hair
was
not
objectionable
to
him
as
it
would
have
been
to
miss
stanbury
and
the
mode
of
her
was
not
displeasing
to
him
and
the
folds
of
her
dress
as
they
fell
across
his
knee
were
welcome
to
his
feelings
he
knew
that
he
was
as
one
under
temptation
but
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
bid
the
tempter
avaunt
say
that
it
is
so
mr
gibson
of
course
it
is
not
so
said
gibson
lying
i
am
so
glad
for
of
course
gibson
when
we
heard
it
we
thought
a
great
deal
about
it
a
man
happiness
depends
so
much
on
whom
he
marries
does
it
and
a
clergyman
more
than
anybody
else
and
we
did
think
she
was
quite
the
sort
of
woman
that
you
would
like
you
see
she
has
had
no
advantages
poor
thing
she
has
been
shut
up
in
a
little
country
cottage
all
her
life
just
a
labourer
hovel
no
more
and
though
it
was
her
fault
of
course
and
we
all
pitied
her
and
were
so
glad
when
miss
stanbury
brought
her
to
the
close
still
you
know
though
one
was
very
glad
of
her
as
an
acquaintance
yet
you
know
as
a
wife
and
for
such
a
dear
dear
friend
she
went
on
and
said
many
other
things
with
equal
enthusiasm
and
then
wiped
her
eyes
and
then
smiled
and
laughed
after
that
she
declared
that
she
was
quite
happy
so
happy
and
so
she
left
him
the
poor
man
after
the
falsehood
had
been
extracted
from
him
said
nothing
more
but
sat
in
patience
listening
to
the
raptures
and
enthusiasm
of
his
friend
he
knew
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
and
he
knew
also
that
his
disgrace
would
be
known
if
dorothy
stanbury
should
accept
his
offer
on
the
morrow
and
yet
how
hardly
he
had
been
used
what
answer
could
he
have
given
compatible
both
with
the
truth
and
with
his
own
personal
dignity
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
was
walking
back
to
exeter
with
brooke
burgess
and
then
brooke
did
ask
him
a
question
or
two
nice
girls
those
frenches
i
think
said
brooke
very
nice
said
gibson
how
miss
stanbury
does
hate
them
says
brooke
not
hate
them
i
hope
said
gibson
she
does
love
them
does
she
well
as
for
love
yes
in
one
sense
i
hope
she
does
miss
stanbury
you
know
is
a
woman
who
expresses
herself
strongly
what
would
she
say
if
she
were
told
that
you
and
i
were
going
to
marry
those
two
girls
we
are
both
favourites
you
know
dear
me
what
a
very
odd
supposition
said
gibson
for
my
part
i
do
think
i
shall
said
brooke
i
do
suppose
i
shall
either
said
gibson
with
a
gravity
which
was
intended
to
convey
some
smattering
of
rebuke
a
fellow
might
do
worse
you
know
said
brooke
for
my
part
i
rather
like
girls
with
chignons
and
all
that
sort
of
but
the
worst
of
it
is
one
ca
marry
two
at
a
time
that
would
be
bigamy
said
gibson
just
so
said
brooke
chapter
xxxvi
miss
stanbury
wrath
punctually
at
eleven
on
the
friday
morning
gibson
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
the
close
the
reader
must
not
imagine
that
he
had
ever
wavered
in
his
intention
with
regard
to
dorothy
stanbury
because
he
had
been
driven
into
a
corner
by
the
pertinacious
ingenuity
of
miss
french
he
never
for
a
moment
thought
of
being
false
to
miss
stanbury
the
elder
falseness
of
that
nature
would
have
been
ruinous
to
him
would
have
made
him
a
marked
man
in
the
city
all
his
days
and
would
probably
have
reached
even
to
the
bishop
ears
he
was
neither
bad
enough
nor
audacious
enough
nor
foolish
enough
for
such
perjury
as
that
and
moreover
though
the
wiles
of
arabella
had
been
potent
with
him
he
very
much
preferred
dorothy
stanbury
seven
years
of
flirtation
with
a
young
lady
is
more
trying
to
the
affection
than
any
duration
of
matrimony
arabella
had
managed
to
awaken
something
of
the
old
glow
but
gibson
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
turned
from
her
mentally
in
disgust
no
whatever
little
trouble
there
might
be
in
his
way
it
was
clearly
his
duty
to
marry
dorothy
stanbury
she
had
the
sweetest
temper
in
the
world
and
blushed
with
the
prettiest
blush
she
would
have
moreover
two
thousand
pounds
on
the
day
she
married
and
there
was
no
saying
what
other
and
greater
pecuniary
advantages
might
follow
his
mind
was
quite
made
up
and
during
the
whole
morning
he
had
been
endeavouring
to
drive
all
disagreeable
reminiscences
of
miss
french
from
his
memory
and
to
arrange
the
words
with
which
he
would
make
his
offer
to
dorothy
he
was
aware
that
he
need
not
be
very
particular
about
his
words
as
dorothy
from
the
bashfulness
of
her
nature
would
be
no
judge
of
eloquence
at
such
a
time
but
still
for
his
own
sake
there
should
be
some
form
of
expression
some
propriety
of
diction
before
eleven
he
had
it
all
by
heart
and
had
nearly
freed
himself
from
the
uneasiness
of
his
falsehood
to
arabella
he
had
given
much
serious
thought
to
the
matter
and
had
quite
resolved
that
he
was
right
in
his
purpose
and
that
he
could
marry
dorothy
with
a
pure
conscience
and
with
a
true
promise
of
a
husband
love
dear
dolly
he
said
to
himself
with
something
of
enthusiasm
as
he
walked
across
the
close
and
he
looked
up
to
the
house
as
he
came
to
it
there
was
to
be
his
future
home
there
was
not
one
of
the
prebends
who
had
a
better
house
and
there
was
a
softness
about
dorothy
eyes
and
a
winning
obedience
in
her
manner
that
were
charming
his
lines
had
fallen
to
him
in
very
pleasant
places
yes
he
would
go
up
to
her
and
take
her
at
once
by
the
hand
and
ask
her
whether
she
would
be
his
now
and
for
ever
he
would
not
let
go
her
hand
till
he
had
brought
her
so
close
to
him
that
she
could
hide
her
blushes
on
his
shoulder
the
whole
thing
had
been
so
well
conceived
had
become
so
clear
to
his
mind
that
he
felt
no
hesitation
or
embarrassment
as
he
knocked
at
the
door
arabella
french
would
no
doubt
hear
of
it
soon
well
she
must
hear
of
it
after
all
she
could
do
him
no
injury
he
was
shown
up
at
once
into
the
and
there
he
found
miss
stanbury
the
elder
oh
mr
gibson
she
said
at
once
is
anything
the
matter
with
dear
dorothy
she
is
the
most
obstinate
young
woman
i
ever
came
across
since
the
world
began
you
do
say
so
but
what
is
it
miss
stanbury
what
is
it
why
just
this
nothing
on
earth
that
i
can
say
to
her
will
induce
her
to
come
down
and
speak
to
you
have
i
offended
her
offended
a
fiddlestick
offence
indeed
an
offer
from
an
honest
man
with
her
friends
approval
and
a
fortune
at
her
back
as
though
she
had
been
born
with
a
gold
spoon
in
her
mouth
and
she
tells
me
that
she
ca
and
wo
and
would
and
should
as
though
i
were
asking
her
to
walk
the
streets
i
declare
i
do
know
what
has
come
to
the
young
women
or
what
it
is
they
want
one
would
have
thought
that
butter
would
melt
in
her
mouth
but
what
is
the
reason
miss
stanbury
oh
reason
you
do
suppose
people
give
reasons
in
these
days
what
reason
have
they
when
they
dress
themselves
up
with
bandboxes
on
their
sconces
just
simply
the
old
reason
do
not
like
thee
fell
why
i
can
not
tell
may
i
not
see
her
myself
miss
stanbury
i
ca
make
her
come
to
you
i
been
at
her
the
whole
morning
gibson
ever
since
daylight
pretty
nearly
she
came
into
my
room
before
i
was
up
and
told
me
she
had
made
up
her
mind
i
coaxed
and
scolded
and
threatened
and
cried
but
if
been
a
milestone
it
could
have
been
of
less
use
i
told
her
she
might
go
back
to
nuncombe
and
she
just
went
off
to
pack
up
but
she
not
to
go
how
can
i
say
what
such
a
young
woman
will
do
i
never
allowed
a
way
of
my
own
for
a
moment
there
brooke
burgess
been
scolding
me
at
that
rate
i
did
know
whether
i
stood
on
my
head
or
my
heels
and
i
do
know
now
then
there
was
a
pause
while
gibson
was
endeavouring
to
decide
what
would
now
be
his
best
course
of
action
do
you
think
ever
come
round
miss
stanbury
i
do
think
she
ever
come
any
way
that
anybody
wants
her
to
come
mr
gibson
i
did
think
she
was
at
all
like
that
said
gibson
almost
in
tears
no
nor
anybody
else
i
been
seeing
it
come
all
the
same
just
the
stanbury
perversity
if
i
wanted
to
keep
her
by
herself
to
take
care
of
me
and
had
set
my
back
up
at
her
if
she
spoke
to
a
man
and
made
her
understand
that
she
was
to
think
of
getting
married
she
have
been
making
eyes
at
every
man
that
came
into
the
house
it
just
what
one
gets
for
going
out
of
one
way
i
did
think
she
be
so
happy
gibson
living
here
as
your
wife
she
and
i
between
us
could
have
managed
for
you
so
nicely
gibson
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
during
which
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
contemplating
no
doubt
the
picture
of
married
life
which
miss
stanbury
had
painted
for
him
a
picture
which
as
it
seemed
was
not
to
be
realised
and
what
had
i
better
do
miss
stanbury
he
asked
at
last
do
i
do
know
what
you
to
do
i
groom
enough
to
bring
a
mare
to
water
but
i
ca
make
her
drink
will
waiting
be
any
good
how
can
i
say
i
tell
you
one
thing
not
to
do
do
go
and
philander
with
those
girls
at
heavitree
it
my
belief
that
dorothy
has
been
thinking
of
them
people
talk
to
her
of
course
i
wish
people
would
hold
their
tongues
people
are
so
indiscreet
people
do
know
how
much
harm
they
may
do
you
given
them
some
excuse
you
know
mr
gibson
this
was
very
and
was
felt
by
gibson
to
be
so
rude
that
he
almost
turned
upon
his
patroness
in
anger
he
had
known
dolly
for
not
more
than
three
months
and
had
devoted
himself
to
her
to
the
great
anger
of
his
older
friends
he
had
come
this
morning
true
to
his
appointment
expecting
that
others
would
keep
their
promises
to
him
as
he
was
ready
to
keep
those
which
he
had
made
and
now
he
was
told
that
it
was
his
fault
i
do
think
that
rather
hard
miss
stanbury
he
said
so
you
have
said
she
nasty
slatternly
girls
without
an
idea
inside
their
noddles
but
it
no
use
your
scolding
me
i
did
mean
to
scold
miss
stanbury
i
done
all
that
i
could
and
you
think
she
wo
see
me
for
a
minute
she
says
she
wo
i
ca
bid
martha
carry
her
down
then
perhaps
i
had
better
leave
you
for
the
present
said
gibson
after
another
pause
so
he
went
a
melancholy
blighted
man
leaving
the
close
he
passed
through
into
southernhay
and
walked
across
by
the
new
streets
towards
the
heavitree
road
he
had
no
design
in
taking
this
route
but
he
went
on
till
he
came
in
sight
of
the
house
in
which
french
lived
as
he
walked
slowly
by
it
he
looked
up
at
the
windows
and
something
of
a
feeling
of
romance
came
across
his
heart
were
his
young
affections
buried
there
or
were
they
not
and
if
so
with
which
of
those
fair
girls
were
they
buried
for
the
last
two
years
up
to
last
night
camilla
had
certainly
been
in
the
ascendant
but
arabella
was
a
sweet
young
woman
and
there
had
been
a
time
when
those
tender
passages
were
going
on
in
which
he
had
thought
that
no
young
woman
ever
was
so
sweet
a
period
of
romance
an
era
of
enthusiasm
a
delicious
holiday
of
insanity
had
been
permitted
to
him
in
his
youth
but
all
that
was
now
over
and
yet
here
he
was
with
three
strings
to
his
bow
so
he
told
himself
and
he
had
not
as
yet
settled
for
himself
the
great
business
of
matrimony
he
was
inclined
to
think
as
he
walked
on
that
he
would
walk
his
life
alone
an
active
useful
but
a
melancholy
man
after
such
experiences
as
his
how
should
he
ever
again
speak
of
his
heart
to
a
woman
during
this
walk
his
mind
recurred
frequently
to
dorothy
stanbury
and
doubtless
he
thought
that
he
had
often
spoken
of
his
heart
to
her
he
was
back
at
his
lodgings
before
three
at
which
hour
he
ate
an
early
dinner
and
then
took
the
afternoon
cathedral
service
at
four
the
evening
he
spent
at
home
thinking
of
the
romance
of
his
early
days
what
would
miss
stanbury
have
said
had
she
seen
him
in
his
easy
chair
behind
the
exeter
argus
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
in
the
meantime
there
was
an
uncomfortable
scene
in
progress
between
dorothy
and
her
aunt
brooke
burgess
as
desired
had
left
the
house
before
eleven
having
taken
upon
himself
when
consulted
to
say
in
the
mildest
terms
that
he
thought
that
in
general
young
women
should
not
be
asked
to
marry
if
they
did
not
like
to
which
opinion
had
been
so
galling
to
miss
stanbury
that
she
had
declared
that
he
had
so
scolded
her
that
she
did
not
know
whether
she
was
standing
on
her
head
or
her
heels
as
soon
as
gibson
left
her
she
sat
herself
down
and
fairly
cried
she
had
ardently
desired
this
thing
and
had
allowed
herself
to
think
of
her
desire
as
of
one
that
would
certainly
be
accomplished
dorothy
would
have
been
so
happy
as
the
wife
of
a
clergyman
miss
stanbury
standard
for
men
and
women
was
not
high
she
did
not
expect
others
to
be
as
as
charitable
and
as
good
as
herself
it
was
not
that
she
gave
to
herself
credit
for
such
virtues
but
she
thought
of
herself
as
one
who
from
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
life
was
bound
to
do
much
for
others
there
was
no
end
to
her
doing
good
for
others
if
only
the
others
would
allow
themselves
to
be
governed
by
her
she
did
not
think
that
gibson
was
a
great
divine
but
she
perceived
that
he
was
a
clergyman
living
decently
of
that
secret
pipe
miss
stanbury
knew
nothing
doing
his
duty
punctually
and
as
she
thought
very
much
in
want
of
a
wife
then
there
was
her
niece
dolly
soft
pretty
feminine
without
a
shilling
and
much
in
want
of
some
one
to
comfort
and
take
care
of
her
what
could
be
better
than
such
a
marriage
and
the
overthrow
to
the
girls
with
the
big
chignons
would
be
so
complete
she
had
set
her
mind
upon
it
and
now
dorothy
said
that
it
could
and
it
would
and
it
should
be
accomplished
she
was
to
be
thrown
over
by
this
chit
of
a
girl
as
she
had
been
thrown
over
by
the
girl
brother
and
when
she
complained
the
girl
simply
offered
to
go
away
at
about
twelve
dorothy
came
creeping
down
into
the
room
in
which
her
aunt
was
sitting
and
pretended
to
occupy
herself
on
some
piece
of
work
for
a
considerable
time
for
three
minutes
perhaps
miss
stanbury
did
not
speak
she
had
resolved
that
she
would
not
speak
to
her
niece
again
at
least
not
for
that
day
she
would
let
the
ungrateful
girl
know
how
miserable
she
had
been
made
but
at
the
close
of
the
three
minutes
her
patience
was
exhausted
what
are
you
doing
there
she
said
i
am
quilting
your
cap
aunt
stanbury
put
it
down
you
sha
do
anything
for
me
i
wo
have
you
touch
my
things
any
more
i
do
like
pretended
service
it
is
not
pretended
aunt
stanbury
i
say
it
is
pretended
why
did
you
pretend
to
me
that
you
would
have
him
when
you
had
made
up
your
mind
against
it
all
the
time
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
if
you
had
so
much
doubt
about
it
you
might
have
done
what
i
wanted
you
i
could
aunt
stanbury
you
mean
you
would
i
wonder
what
it
is
you
do
expect
i
do
expect
anything
aunt
stanbury
no
and
i
do
expect
anything
what
an
old
fool
i
am
ever
to
look
for
any
comfort
why
should
i
think
that
anybody
would
care
for
me
indeed
i
do
care
for
you
in
what
sort
of
way
do
you
show
it
you
just
like
your
brother
hugh
i
disgraced
myself
to
that
man
promising
what
i
could
not
perform
i
declare
it
makes
me
sick
when
i
think
of
it
why
did
you
not
tell
me
at
once
dorothy
said
nothing
further
but
sat
with
the
cap
on
her
lap
she
did
not
dare
to
resume
her
needle
and
she
did
not
like
to
put
the
cap
aside
as
by
doing
so
it
would
seem
as
though
she
had
accepted
her
aunt
prohibition
against
her
work
for
half
an
hour
she
sat
thus
during
which
time
miss
stanbury
dropped
asleep
she
woke
with
a
start
and
began
to
scold
again
what
the
good
of
sitting
there
all
the
day
with
your
hands
before
you
doing
nothing
but
dorothy
had
been
very
busy
she
had
been
making
up
her
mind
and
had
determined
to
communicate
her
resolution
to
her
aunt
dear
aunt
she
said
i
have
been
thinking
of
something
it
too
late
now
said
miss
stanbury
i
see
i
made
you
very
unhappy
of
course
you
have
and
you
think
that
i
ungrateful
i
not
ungrateful
and
i
think
that
hugh
is
never
mind
hugh
only
because
it
seems
so
hard
that
you
should
take
so
much
trouble
about
us
and
that
then
there
should
be
so
much
vexation
i
find
it
very
hard
so
i
think
that
i
better
go
back
to
nuncombe
that
what
you
call
gratitude
i
do
like
to
stay
here
and
make
you
unhappy
i
ca
think
that
i
ought
to
have
done
what
you
asked
me
because
i
did
not
feel
at
all
in
that
way
about
gibson
but
as
i
have
only
disappointed
you
it
will
be
better
that
i
should
go
home
i
have
been
very
happy
here
very
bother
exclaimed
miss
stanbury
i
have
and
i
do
love
you
though
you
wo
believe
it
but
i
am
sure
i
ought
to
remain
to
make
you
unhappy
i
shall
never
forget
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
and
though
you
call
me
ungrateful
i
am
not
but
i
know
that
i
ought
not
to
stay
as
i
can
not
do
what
you
wish
so
if
you
please
i
will
go
back
to
nuncombe
you
not
do
anything
of
the
kind
said
miss
stanbury
but
it
will
be
better
yes
of
course
no
doubt
i
suppose
you
tired
of
us
all
it
is
not
that
i
tired
aunt
stanbury
it
is
that
at
all
dorothy
had
now
become
red
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
but
i
can
not
stay
where
people
think
that
i
am
ungrateful
if
you
please
aunt
stanbury
i
will
go
then
of
course
there
was
a
compromise
dorothy
did
at
last
consent
to
remain
in
the
close
but
only
on
condition
that
she
should
be
forgiven
for
her
sin
in
reference
to
gibson
and
be
permitted
to
go
on
with
her
aunt

chapter
xxxvii
mont
cenis
illustration
the
night
had
been
fine
and
warm
and
it
was
now
noon
on
a
fine
september
day
when
the
train
from
paris
reached
michael
on
the
route
to
italy
by
mont
cenis
as
all
the
world
knows
michael
is
or
was
a
year
or
two
back
the
end
of
railway
travelling
in
that
direction
at
the
time
fell
grand
project
of
carrying
a
line
of
rails
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
was
only
in
preparation
and
the
journey
from
michael
to
susa
was
still
made
by
the
diligences
those
dear
old
continental
coaches
which
are
now
nearly
as
extinct
as
our
own
but
which
did
not
deserve
death
so
fully
as
did
our
abominable
vehicles
the
coupé
of
a
diligence
or
better
still
the
banquette
was
a
luxurious
mode
of
travelling
as
compared
with
anything
that
our
coaches
offered
there
used
indeed
to
be
a
certain
halo
of
glory
round
the
occupant
of
the
box
of
a
the
man
who
had
secured
that
seat
was
supposed
to
know
something
about
the
world
and
to
be
such
a
one
that
the
passengers
sitting
behind
him
would
be
proud
to
be
allowed
to
talk
to
him
but
the
prestige
of
the
position
was
greater
than
the
comfort
a
night
on
the
box
of
a
was
but
a
bad
time
and
a
night
inside
a
was
a
night
in
purgatory
whereas
a
seat
up
above
on
the
banquette
of
a
diligence
passing
over
the
alps
with
room
for
the
feet
and
support
for
the
back
with
plenty
of
rugs
and
plenty
of
tobacco
used
to
be
on
the
mont
cenis
and
still
is
on
some
other
mountain
passes
a
very
comfortable
mode
of
seeing
a
mountain
route
for
those
desirous
of
occupying
the
coupé
or
the
three
front
seats
of
the
body
of
the
vehicle
it
must
be
admitted
that
difficulties
frequently
arose
and
that
such
difficulties
were
very
common
at
michael
there
would
be
two
or
three
of
those
enormous
vehicles
preparing
to
start
for
the
mountain
whereas
it
would
appear
that
twelve
or
fifteen
passengers
had
come
down
from
paris
armed
with
tickets
assuring
them
that
this
preferable
mode
of
travelling
should
be
theirs
and
then
assertions
would
be
made
somewhat
recklessly
by
the
officials
to
the
effect
that
all
the
diligence
was
coupé
it
would
generally
be
the
case
that
some
englishman
who
could
not
speak
french
would
go
to
the
wall
together
with
his
wife
englishmen
with
their
wives
who
ca
speak
french
can
nevertheless
be
very
angry
and
threaten
loudly
when
they
suppose
themselves
to
be
a
englishman
though
he
ca
speak
a
word
of
french
wo
believe
a
french
official
who
tells
him
that
the
diligence
is
all
coupé
when
he
finds
himself
with
his
unfortunate
partner
in
a
roundabout
place
behind
with
two
priests
a
dirty
man
who
looks
like
a
brigand
a
sick
and
three
agricultural
labourers
the
attempt
however
was
frequently
made
and
thus
there
used
to
be
occasionally
a
little
noise
round
the
bureau
at
michael
on
the
morning
of
which
we
are
speaking
two
englishmen
had
just
made
good
their
claim
each
independently
of
the
other
each
without
having
heard
or
seen
the
other
when
two
american
ladies
coming
up
very
tardily
endeavoured
to
prove
their
rights
the
ladies
were
without
other
companions
and
were
not
fluent
with
their
french
but
were
clearly
entitled
to
their
seats
they
were
told
that
the
conveyance
was
all
coupé
but
perversely
would
not
believe
the
statement
the
official
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
signified
that
his
ultimatum
had
been
pronounced
what
can
an
official
do
in
such
circumstances
when
more
coupé
passengers
are
sent
to
him
than
the
coupés
at
his
command
will
hold
but
we
have
paid
for
the
coupé
said
the
elder
american
lady
with
considerable
indignation
though
her
french
was
imperfect
for
american
ladies
understand
their
rights
bah
yes
you
have
paid
and
you
shall
go
what
would
you
have
we
would
have
what
we
have
paid
for
said
the
american
lady
then
the
official
rose
from
his
stool
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
and
made
a
motion
with
both
his
hands
intended
to
shew
that
the
thing
was
finished
it
is
a
robbery
said
the
elder
american
lady
to
the
younger
i
should
not
mind
only
you
are
so
unwell
it
will
not
kill
me
i
dare
say
said
the
younger
then
one
of
the
english
gentlemen
declared
that
his
place
was
very
much
at
the
service
of
the
invalid
and
the
other
englishman
declared
that
his
also
was
at
the
service
of
the
invalid
companion
then
and
not
till
then
the
two
men
recognised
each
other
one
was
glascock
on
his
way
to
naples
and
the
other
was
trevelyan
on
his
way
he
knew
not
whither
upon
this
of
course
they
spoke
to
each
other
in
london
they
had
been
well
acquainted
each
having
been
an
intimate
guest
at
the
house
of
old
lady
milborough
and
each
knew
something
of
the
other
recent
history
glascock
was
aware
as
was
all
the
world
that
trevelyan
had
quarrelled
with
his
wife
and
trevelyan
was
aware
that
glascock
had
been
spoken
of
as
a
suitor
to
his
own
of
that
visit
which
glascock
had
made
to
nuncombe
putney
and
of
the
manner
in
which
nora
had
behaved
to
her
lover
trevelyan
knew
nothing
their
greetings
spoken
their
first
topic
of
conversation
was
of
course
the
injury
proposed
to
be
done
to
the
american
ladies
and
which
would
now
fall
upon
them
they
went
into
the
together
and
during
such
toilet
as
they
could
make
there
grumbled
furiously
they
would
take
post
horses
over
the
mountain
not
from
any
love
of
solitary
grandeur
but
in
order
that
they
might
make
the
company
pay
for
its
iniquity
but
it
was
soon
apparent
to
them
that
they
themselves
had
no
ground
of
complaint
and
as
everybody
was
very
civil
and
as
a
seat
in
the
banquette
over
the
heads
of
the
american
ladies
was
provided
for
them
and
as
the
man
from
the
bureau
came
and
apologised
they
consented
to
be
pacified
and
ended
of
course
by
tipping
of
the
servants
about
the
yard
glascock
had
a
man
of
his
own
with
him
who
was
very
nearly
being
put
on
to
the
same
seat
with
his
master
as
an
extra
civility
but
this
inconvenience
was
at
last
avoided
having
settled
these
little
difficulties
they
went
into
breakfast
in
the
buffet
there
could
be
no
better
breakfast
than
used
to
be
given
in
the
buffet
at
the
railway
terminus
at
michael
the
company
might
occasionally
be
led
into
errors
about
that
question
of
coupé
seats
but
in
reference
to
their
provisions
they
set
an
example
which
might
be
of
great
use
to
us
here
in
england
it
is
probably
the
case
that
breakfasts
for
travellers
are
not
so
frequently
needed
here
as
they
are
on
the
continent
but
still
there
is
often
to
be
found
a
crowd
of
people
ready
to
eat
if
only
the
wherewithal
were
there
we
are
often
told
in
our
newspapers
that
england
is
disgraced
by
this
and
by
that
by
the
unreadiness
of
our
army
by
the
unfitness
of
our
navy
by
the
irrationality
of
our
laws
by
the
immobility
of
our
prejudices
and
what
not
but
the
real
disgrace
of
england
is
the
railway
sandwich
that
whited
sepulchre
fair
enough
outside
but
so
meagre
poor
and
spiritless
within
such
a
thing
of
shreds
and
parings
such
a
dab
of
food
telling
us
that
the
poor
bone
whence
it
was
scraped
had
been
made
utterly
bare
before
it
was
sent
into
the
kitchen
for
the
soup
pot
in
france
one
does
get
food
at
the
railway
stations
and
at
michael
the
breakfast
was
unexceptional
our
two
friends
seated
themselves
near
to
the
american
ladies
and
were
of
course
thanked
for
their
politeness
american
women
are
taught
by
the
habits
of
their
country
to
think
that
men
should
give
way
to
them
more
absolutely
than
is
in
accordance
with
the
practices
of
life
in
europe
a
seat
in
a
public
conveyance
in
the
states
when
merely
occupied
by
a
man
used
to
be
regarded
by
any
woman
as
being
at
her
service
as
completely
as
though
it
were
vacant
one
woman
indicating
a
place
to
another
would
point
with
equal
freedom
to
a
man
or
a
space
it
is
said
that
this
is
a
little
altered
now
and
that
european
views
on
this
subject
are
spreading
themselves
our
two
ladies
however
who
were
pretty
and
attractive
even
after
the
night
journey
were
manifestly
more
impressed
with
the
villainy
of
the
french
officials
than
they
were
with
the
kindness
of
their
english
neighbours
and
nothing
can
be
done
to
punish
them
said
the
younger
of
them
to
glascock
nothing
i
should
think
said
he
nothing
will
at
any
rate
and
you
will
not
get
back
your
money
said
the
elder
who
though
the
elder
was
probably
not
much
above
twenty
well
no
time
is
money
they
say
it
would
take
thrice
the
value
of
the
time
in
money
and
then
one
would
probably
fail
they
have
done
very
well
for
us
and
i
suppose
there
are
difficulties
it
could
have
taken
place
in
our
country
said
the
younger
lady
all
the
same
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
it
would
not
have
been
nice
for
us
to
have
to
go
up
into
the
banquette
they
would
have
put
you
into
the
interior
and
that
would
have
been
worse
i
hate
being
put
anywhere
as
if
i
were
a
sheep
it
seems
so
odd
to
us
that
you
here
should
be
all
so
tame
do
you
mean
the
english
or
the
french
or
the
world
in
general
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
we
mean
europeans
said
the
younger
lady
who
was
better
after
her
breakfast
but
then
we
think
that
the
french
have
something
of
compensation
in
their
manners
and
their
ways
of
life
their
climate
the
beauty
of
their
cities
and
their
general
management
of
things
they
are
very
great
in
many
ways
no
doubt
said
glascock
they
do
understand
living
better
than
you
do
said
the
elder
everything
is
so
much
brighter
with
them
said
the
younger
they
contrive
to
give
a
grace
to
existence
said
the
elder
there
is
such
a
welcome
among
them
for
strangers
said
the
younger
particularly
in
reference
to
places
taken
in
the
coupé
said
trevelyan
who
had
hardly
spoken
before
ah
that
is
an
affair
of
honesty
said
the
elder
if
we
want
honesty
i
believe
we
must
go
back
to
the
stars
and
stripes
glascock
looked
up
from
his
plate
almost
aghast
he
said
nothing
however
but
called
for
the
waiter
and
paid
for
his
breakfast
nevertheless
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
travelling
friendship
engendered
between
the
ladies
and
our
two
friends
before
the
diligence
had
left
the
railway
yard
they
were
two
miss
spaldings
going
on
to
florence
at
which
place
they
had
an
uncle
who
was
minister
from
the
states
to
the
kingdom
of
italy
and
they
were
not
at
all
unwilling
to
receive
such
little
civilities
as
gentlemen
can
give
to
ladies
when
travelling
the
whole
party
intended
to
sleep
at
turin
that
night
and
they
were
altogether
on
good
terms
with
each
other
when
they
started
on
the
journey
from
michael
clever
women
those
said
glascock
as
soon
as
they
had
arranged
their
legs
and
arms
in
the
banquette
yes
indeed
american
women
always
are
clever
and
are
almost
always
pretty
i
do
not
like
them
said
trevelyan
who
in
these
days
was
in
a
mood
to
like
nothing
they
are
exigeant
and
then
they
are
so
hard
they
want
the
weakness
that
a
woman
ought
to
have
that
comes
from
what
they
would
call
your
insular
prejudice
we
are
accustomed
to
less
on
the
part
of
women
than
is
customary
with
them
we
prefer
women
to
rule
us
by
seeming
to
yield
in
the
states
as
i
take
it
the
women
never
yield
and
the
men
have
to
fight
their
own
battles
with
other
tactics
i
do
know
what
their
tactics
are
they
keep
their
distance
the
men
live
much
by
themselves
as
though
they
knew
they
would
not
have
a
chance
in
the
presence
of
their
wives
and
daughters
nevertheless
they
do
manage
these
things
badly
you
very
rarely
hear
of
an
american
being
separated
from
his
wife
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
his
mouth
than
glascock
knew
and
remembered
and
felt
what
he
had
said
there
are
occasions
in
which
a
man
sins
so
deeply
against
fitness
and
the
circumstances
of
the
hour
that
it
becomes
impossible
for
him
to
slur
over
his
sin
as
though
it
had
not
been
committed
there
are
certain
little
peccadilloes
in
society
which
one
can
manage
to
throw
behind
one
perhaps
with
some
difficulty
and
awkwardness
but
still
they
are
put
aside
and
conversation
goes
on
though
with
a
hitch
but
there
are
graver
offences
the
gravity
of
which
strikes
the
offender
so
seriously
that
it
becomes
impossible
for
him
to
seem
even
to
ignore
his
own
iniquity
ashes
must
be
eaten
publicly
and
sackcloth
worn
before
the
eyes
of
men
it
was
so
now
with
poor
glascock
he
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
whether
or
no
it
was
possible
that
he
should
continue
his
remarks
about
the
american
ladies
without
betraying
his
own
consciousness
of
the
thing
that
he
had
done
and
he
found
that
it
was
quite
impossible
he
knew
that
he
was
red
up
to
his
hairs
and
hot
and
that
his
blood
tingled
his
blushes
indeed
would
not
be
seen
in
the
seclusion
of
the
banquette
but
he
could
not
overcome
the
heat
and
the
tingling
there
was
silence
for
about
three
minutes
and
then
he
felt
that
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
confess
his
own
fault
trevelyan
he
said
i
am
very
sorry
for
the
allusion
that
i
made
i
ought
to
have
been
less
awkward
and
i
beg
your
pardon
it
does
not
matter
said
trevelyan
of
course
i
know
that
everybody
is
talking
of
it
behind
my
back
i
am
not
to
expect
that
people
will
be
silent
because
i
am
unhappy
nevertheless
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
other
there
was
but
little
further
conversation
between
them
till
they
reached
lanslebourg
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
at
which
place
they
occupied
themselves
with
getting
coffee
for
the
two
american
ladies
the
miss
spaldings
took
their
coffee
almost
with
as
much
grace
as
though
it
had
been
handed
to
them
by
frenchmen
and
indeed
they
were
very
gracious
as
is
the
nature
of
american
ladies
in
spite
of
that
hardness
of
which
trevelyan
had
complained
they
assume
an
intimacy
readily
with
no
appearance
of
impropriety
and
are
at
their
ease
easily
when
therefore
they
were
handed
out
of
their
carriage
by
glascock
the
bystanders
at
lanslebourg
might
have
thought
that
the
whole
party
had
been
travelling
together
from
new
york
what
should
we
have
done
if
you
had
taken
pity
on
us
said
the
elder
lady
i
do
think
we
could
have
climbed
up
into
that
high
place
and
look
at
the
crowd
that
have
come
out
of
the
interior
a
man
has
some
advantages
after
all
i
am
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
what
they
are
said
glascock
he
can
give
up
his
place
to
a
lady
and
can
climb
up
into
a
banquette
and
he
can
be
a
member
of
congress
said
the
younger
i
sooner
be
senator
from
massachusetts
than
be
the
queen
of
england
so
would
i
said
glascock
i
glad
we
can
agree
about
one
thing
the
two
gentlemen
agreed
to
walk
up
the
mountain
together
and
with
some
trouble
induced
the
conductor
to
permit
them
to
do
so
why
conductors
of
diligences
should
object
to
such
relief
to
their
horses
the
ordinary
englishman
can
hardly
understand
but
in
truth
they
feel
so
deeply
the
responsibility
which
attaches
itself
to
their
shepherding
of
their
sheep
that
they
are
always
fearing
lest
some
poor
lamb
should
go
astray
on
the
mountain
side
and
though
the
road
be
broad
and
very
plainly
marked
the
conductor
never
feels
secure
that
his
passenger
will
find
his
way
safely
to
the
summit
he
likes
to
know
that
each
of
his
flock
is
in
his
right
place
and
disapproves
altogether
of
an
erratic
spirit
but
glascock
at
last
prevailed
and
the
two
men
started
together
up
the
mountain
when
the
permission
has
been
once
obtained
the
walker
may
be
sure
that
his
guide
and
shepherd
will
not
desert
him
of
course
i
know
said
trevelyan
when
the
third
twist
up
the
mountain
had
been
overcome
that
people
talk
about
me
and
my
wife
it
is
a
part
of
the
punishment
for
the
mistake
that
one
makes
it
is
a
sad
affair
altogether
the
saddest
in
the
world
lady
milborough
has
no
doubt
spoken
to
you
about
it
well
yes
she
has
how
could
she
help
it
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
suppose
that
people
are
to
hold
their
tongues
about
me
more
than
they
do
about
others
intimate
as
she
is
with
you
of
course
she
has
spoken
to
you
i
was
in
hopes
that
something
might
have
been
done
by
this
time
nothing
has
been
done
sometimes
i
think
i
shall
put
an
end
to
myself
it
makes
me
so
wretched
then
why
do
you
agree
to
forget
and
forgive
and
have
done
with
it
that
is
so
easily
said
so
easily
said
after
this
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
considerable
distance
glascock
was
not
anxious
to
talk
about
trevelyan
wife
but
he
did
wish
to
ask
a
question
or
two
about
trevelyan
sister
if
only
this
could
be
done
without
telling
too
much
of
his
own
secret
there
nothing
i
think
so
grand
as
walking
up
a
mountain
he
said
after
a
while
it
all
very
well
said
trevelyan
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
imply
that
to
him
in
his
present
miserable
condition
all
recreations
exercises
and
occupations
were
mere
leather
and
prunella
i
do
mean
you
know
in
the
alpine
club
way
said
glascock
too
old
and
too
stiff
for
that
but
when
the
path
is
good
and
the
air
not
too
cold
and
when
it
is
neither
snowing
nor
thawing
nor
raining
and
when
the
sun
is
hot
and
you
got
plenty
of
time
and
know
that
you
can
stop
any
moment
you
like
and
be
pushed
up
by
a
carriage
i
do
think
walking
up
a
mountain
is
very
fine
if
got
proper
shoes
and
a
good
stick
and
it
is
too
soon
after
dinner
there
nothing
like
the
air
of
alps
and
glascock
renewed
his
pace
and
stretched
himself
against
the
hill
at
the
rate
of
three
miles
an
hour
i
used
to
be
very
fond
of
switzerland
said
trevelyan
but
i
care
about
it
now
my
eye
has
lost
all
its
taste
it
is
the
eye
said
glascock
well
no
the
truth
is
that
when
one
is
absolutely
unhappy
one
can
not
revel
in
the
imagination
i
do
believe
in
the
miseries
of
poets
i
think
myself
said
glascock
that
a
poet
should
have
a
good
digestion
trevelyan
and
her
sister
went
down
to
nuncombe
putney
in
devonshire
they
did
go
there
have
they
moved
since
a
very
pretty
place
is
nuncombe
putney
you
have
been
there
then
glascock
blushed
again
he
was
certainly
an
awkward
man
saying
things
that
he
ought
not
to
say
and
telling
secrets
which
ought
not
to
have
been
told
well
yes
i
have
been
there
as
it
happens
just
lately
do
you
mean
glascock
paused
hoping
to
find
his
way
out
of
the
scrape
but
soon
perceived
that
there
was
no
way
out
he
could
not
lie
even
in
an
affair
of
love
and
was
altogether
destitute
of
those
honest
subterfuges
subterfuges
honest
in
such
position
of
which
a
dozen
would
have
been
at
once
at
the
command
of
any
woman
and
with
one
of
which
sufficient
for
the
moment
most
men
would
have
been
able
to
arm
themselves
indeed
yes
he
said
almost
stammering
as
he
spoke
it
was
lately
since
your
wife
went
there
trevelyan
though
he
had
been
told
of
the
possibility
of
courtship
felt
himself
almost
aggrieved
by
this
man
intrusion
on
his
wife
retreat
had
he
not
sent
her
there
that
she
might
be
private
and
what
right
had
any
one
to
invade
such
privacy
i
suppose
i
had
better
tell
the
truth
at
once
said
glascock
i
went
to
see
miss
rowley
oh
indeed
my
secret
will
be
safe
with
you
i
know
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
secret
said
trevelyan
i
should
have
thought
that
they
would
have
told
me
i
do
see
that
however
it
does
matter
much
i
got
nothing
by
my
journey
are
the
ladies
still
at
nuncombe
putney
no
they
have
moved
from
there
to
london
not
back
to
curzon
street
oh
dear
no
there
is
no
house
in
curzon
street
for
them
now
this
was
said
in
a
tone
so
sad
that
it
almost
made
glascock
weep
they
are
staying
with
an
aunt
of
theirs
out
to
the
east
of
the
city
at
st
diddulph
yes
with
outhouse
the
clergyman
there
you
ca
conceive
what
it
is
not
to
be
able
to
see
your
own
child
and
yet
how
can
i
take
the
boy
from
her
of
course
not
he
only
a
baby
and
yet
all
this
is
brought
on
me
solely
by
her
obstinacy
god
knows
however
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
against
her
people
choose
to
say
that
i
am
to
blame
and
they
may
say
so
for
me
nothing
that
any
one
may
say
can
add
anything
to
the
weight
that
i
have
to
bear
then
they
walked
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
in
silence
and
in
due
time
were
picked
up
by
their
proper
shepherd
and
carried
down
to
susa
at
a
pace
that
would
give
an
english
coachman
a
concussion
of
the
brain
why
passengers
for
turin
who
reach
susa
dusty
tired
and
sleepy
should
be
detained
at
that
place
for
an
hour
and
a
half
instead
of
being
forwarded
to
their
beds
in
the
great
city
is
never
made
very
apparent
all
travelling
officials
on
the
continent
of
europe
are
very
slow
in
their
manipulation
of
luggage
but
as
they
are
equally
correct
we
will
find
the
excuse
for
their
tardiness
in
the
latter
quality
the
hour
and
a
half
however
is
a
necessity
and
it
is
very
grievous
on
this
occasion
the
two
miss
spaldings
ate
their
supper
and
the
two
gentlemen
waited
on
them
the
ladies
had
learned
to
regard
at
any
rate
glascock
as
their
own
property
and
received
his
services
graciously
indeed
but
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
when
he
was
sent
from
their
peculiar
corner
of
the
big
dirty
refreshment
room
to
the
to
fetch
an
apple
and
then
desired
to
change
it
because
the
one
which
he
had
brought
was
spotted
he
rather
liked
it
and
when
he
sat
down
with
his
knees
near
to
theirs
actually
trying
to
eat
a
large
italian
apple
himself
simply
because
they
had
eaten
one
and
discussed
with
them
the
passage
over
the
mont
cenis
he
began
to
think
that
susa
was
after
all
a
place
in
which
an
hour
and
a
half
might
be
whiled
away
without
much
cause
for
complaint
we
only
stay
one
night
at
turin
said
caroline
spalding
the
elder
and
we
shall
have
to
start
at
ten
to
get
through
to
florence
said
olivia
the
younger
is
it
cruel
wasting
all
this
time
when
we
might
be
in
bed
it
is
not
for
me
to
complain
of
the
cruelty
said
glascock
we
should
have
fared
infinitely
worse
if
we
had
met
you
said
caroline
spalding
but
our
republican
simplicity
wo
allow
us
to
assert
that
even
your
society
is
better
than
going
to
bed
after
a
journey
of
thirty
hours
said
olivia
in
the
meantime
trevelyan
was
roaming
about
the
station
moodily
by
himself
and
the
place
is
one
not
apt
to
restore
cheerfulness
to
a
moody
man
by
any
resources
of
its
own
when
the
time
for
departure
came
glascock
sought
him
and
found
him
but
trevelyan
had
chosen
a
corner
for
himself
in
a
carriage
and
declared
that
he
would
rather
avoid
the
ladies
for
the
present
do
think
me
uncivil
to
leave
you
he
said
but
the
truth
is
i
do
like
american
ladies
i
do
rather
said
glascock
you
can
say
that
i
got
a
headache
said
trevelyan
so
glascock
returned
to
his
friends
and
did
say
that
trevelyan
had
a
headache
it
was
the
first
time
that
a
name
had
been
mentioned
between
them
trevelyan
what
a
pretty
name
it
sounds
like
a
novel
said
olivia
a
very
clever
man
said
glascock
and
much
liked
by
his
own
circle
but
he
has
had
trouble
and
is
unhappy
he
looks
unhappy
said
caroline
the
most
miserable
looking
man
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
said
olivia
then
it
was
agreed
between
them
as
they
went
up
to
trompetta
hotel
that
they
would
go
on
together
by
the
ten
train
to
florence
chapter
xxxviii
verdict
of
the
jury
mad
my
lord
trevelyan
was
left
alone
at
turin
when
glascock
went
on
to
florence
with
his
fair
american
friends
it
was
imperatively
necessary
that
he
should
remain
at
turin
though
he
had
no
business
there
of
any
kind
whatever
and
did
not
know
a
single
person
in
the
city
and
of
all
towns
in
italy
turin
has
perhaps
less
of
attraction
to
offer
to
the
solitary
visitor
than
any
other
it
is
new
and
parallelogrammatic
as
an
american
town
is
very
cold
in
cold
weather
very
hot
in
hot
weather
and
now
that
it
has
been
robbed
of
its
life
as
a
capital
is
as
dull
and
uninteresting
as
though
it
were
german
or
english
there
is
the
armoury
and
the
river
po
and
a
good
hotel
but
what
are
these
things
to
a
man
who
is
forced
to
live
alone
in
a
place
for
four
days
or
perhaps
a
week
trevelyan
was
bound
to
remain
at
turin
till
he
should
hear
from
bozzle
no
one
but
bozzle
knew
his
address
and
he
could
do
nothing
till
bozzle
should
have
communicated
to
him
tidings
of
what
was
being
done
at
diddulph
there
is
perhaps
no
great
social
question
so
imperfectly
understood
among
us
at
the
present
day
as
that
which
refers
to
the
line
which
divides
sanity
from
insanity
that
this
man
is
sane
and
that
other
unfortunately
mad
we
do
know
well
enough
and
we
know
also
that
one
man
may
be
subject
to
various
hallucinations
may
fancy
himself
to
be
a
teapot
or
what
not
and
yet
be
in
such
a
condition
of
mind
as
to
call
for
no
intervention
either
on
behalf
of
his
friends
or
of
the
law
while
another
may
be
in
possession
of
intellectual
faculties
capable
of
lucid
exertion
for
the
highest
purposes
and
yet
be
so
mad
that
bodily
restraint
upon
him
is
indispensable
we
know
that
the
sane
man
is
responsible
for
what
he
does
and
that
the
insane
man
is
irresponsible
but
we
do
not
know
we
only
guess
wildly
at
the
state
of
mind
of
those
who
now
and
again
act
like
madmen
though
no
court
or
council
of
experts
has
declared
them
to
be
mad
the
bias
of
the
public
mind
is
to
press
heavily
on
such
men
till
the
law
attempts
to
touch
them
as
though
they
were
thoroughly
responsible
and
then
when
the
law
interferes
to
screen
them
as
though
they
were
altogether
irresponsible
the
same
juryman
who
would
find
a
man
mad
who
has
murdered
a
young
woman
would
in
private
life
express
a
desire
that
the
same
young
man
should
be
hung
crucified
or
skinned
alive
if
he
had
moodily
and
without
reason
broken
his
faith
to
the
young
woman
in
lieu
of
killing
her
now
trevelyan
was
in
truth
mad
on
the
subject
of
his
wife
alleged
infidelity
he
had
abandoned
everything
that
he
valued
in
the
world
and
had
made
himself
wretched
in
every
affair
of
life
because
he
could
not
submit
to
acknowledge
to
himself
the
possibility
of
error
on
his
own
part
for
that
in
truth
was
the
condition
of
his
mind
he
had
never
hitherto
believed
that
she
had
been
false
to
her
vow
and
had
sinned
against
him
irredeemably
but
he
had
thought
that
in
her
regard
for
another
man
she
had
slighted
him
and
so
thinking
he
had
subjected
her
to
a
severity
of
rebuke
which
no
woman
could
have
borne
his
wife
had
not
tried
to
bear
it
in
her
indignation
had
not
striven
to
cure
the
evil
then
had
come
his
resolution
that
she
should
submit
or
part
from
him
and
having
so
resolved
nothing
could
shake
him
though
every
friend
he
possessed
was
now
against
him
including
even
lady
milborough
he
was
certain
that
he
was
right
had
not
his
wife
sworn
to
obey
him
and
was
not
her
whole
conduct
one
tissue
of
disobedience
would
not
the
man
who
submitted
to
this
find
himself
driven
to
submit
to
things
worse
let
her
own
her
fault
let
her
submit
and
then
she
should
come
back
to
him
he
had
not
considered
when
his
resolutions
to
this
effect
were
first
forming
themselves
that
a
separation
between
a
man
and
his
wife
once
effected
can
not
be
annulled
and
as
it
were
cured
so
as
to
leave
no
cicatrice
behind
gradually
as
he
spent
day
after
day
in
thinking
on
this
one
subject
he
came
to
feel
that
even
were
his
wife
to
submit
to
own
her
fault
humbly
and
to
come
back
to
him
this
very
coming
back
would
in
itself
be
a
new
wound
could
he
go
out
again
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
to
the
houses
of
those
who
knew
that
he
had
repudiated
her
because
of
her
friendship
with
another
man
could
he
open
again
that
house
in
curzon
street
and
let
things
go
on
quietly
as
they
had
gone
before
he
told
himself
that
it
was
impossible
that
he
and
she
were
ineffably
disgraced
that
if
reunited
they
must
live
buried
out
of
sight
in
some
remote
distance
and
he
told
himself
also
that
he
could
never
be
with
her
again
night
or
day
without
thinking
of
the
separation
his
happiness
had
been
shipwrecked
then
he
had
put
himself
into
the
hands
of
bozzle
and
bozzle
had
taught
him
that
women
very
often
do
go
astray
bozzle
idea
of
female
virtue
was
not
high
and
he
had
opportunities
of
implanting
his
idea
on
his
client
mind
trevelyan
hated
the
man
he
was
filled
with
disgust
by
bozzle
words
and
was
made
miserable
by
presence
yet
he
came
gradually
to
believe
in
bozzle
bozzle
alone
believed
in
him
there
were
none
but
bozzle
who
did
not
bid
him
to
submit
himself
to
his
disobedient
wife
and
then
as
he
came
to
believe
in
bozzle
he
grew
to
be
more
and
more
assured
that
no
one
but
bozzle
could
tell
him
facts
his
chivalry
and
love
and
sense
of
woman
honour
with
something
of
manly
pride
on
his
own
part
so
he
told
himself
had
taught
him
to
believe
it
to
be
impossible
that
his
wife
should
have
sinned
bozzle
who
knew
the
world
thought
otherwise
bozzle
who
had
no
interest
in
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other
would
find
out
facts
what
if
his
chivalry
and
love
and
manly
pride
had
deceived
him
there
were
women
who
sinned
then
he
prayed
that
his
wife
might
not
be
such
a
woman
and
got
up
from
his
prayers
almost
convinced
that
she
was
a
sinner
his
mind
was
at
work
upon
it
always
could
it
be
that
she
was
so
base
as
this
so
vile
a
thing
so
abject
such
dirt
pollution
filth
but
there
were
such
cases
nay
were
they
not
almost
numberless
he
found
himself
reading
in
the
papers
records
of
such
things
from
day
to
day
and
thought
that
in
doing
so
he
was
simply
acquiring
experience
necessary
for
himself
if
it
were
so
he
had
indeed
done
well
to
separate
himself
from
a
thing
so
infamous
and
if
it
were
not
so
how
could
it
be
that
that
man
had
gone
to
her
in
devonshire
he
had
received
from
his
wife
hands
a
short
note
addressed
to
the
man
in
which
the
man
was
desired
by
her
not
to
go
to
her
or
to
write
to
her
again
because
of
her
husband
commands
he
had
shown
this
to
bozzle
and
bozzle
had
smiled
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
they
does
bozzle
had
said
then
they
writes
another
by
post
he
had
consulted
bozzle
as
to
the
sending
on
of
that
letter
and
bozzle
had
been
strongly
of
opinion
that
it
should
be
forwarded
a
copy
having
been
duly
taken
and
attested
by
himself
it
might
be
very
pretty
evidence
if
the
letter
were
not
forwarded
bozzle
thought
that
the
omission
to
do
so
might
be
given
in
evidence
against
his
employer
bozzle
was
very
careful
and
full
of
evidence
the
letter
therefore
was
sent
on
to
colonel
osborne
if
there
going
between
we
shall
nobble
said
bozzle
trevelyan
tore
his
hair
in
despair
but
believed
that
there
would
be
he
came
to
believe
everything
and
though
he
prayed
fervently
that
his
wife
might
not
be
led
astray
that
she
might
be
saved
at
any
rate
from
utter
vice
yet
he
almost
came
to
hope
that
it
might
be
otherwise
not
indeed
with
the
hope
of
the
sane
man
who
desires
that
which
he
tells
himself
to
be
for
his
advantage
but
with
the
hope
of
the
insane
man
who
loves
to
feed
his
grievance
even
though
the
grief
should
be
his
death
they
who
do
not
understand
that
a
man
may
be
brought
to
hope
that
which
of
all
things
is
the
most
grievous
to
him
have
not
observed
with
sufficient
closeness
the
perversity
of
the
human
mind
trevelyan
would
have
given
all
that
he
had
to
save
his
wife
would
even
now
have
cut
his
tongue
out
before
he
would
have
expressed
to
anyone
save
to
bozzle
a
suspicion
that
she
could
in
truth
have
been
guilty
was
continually
telling
himself
that
further
life
would
be
impossible
to
him
if
he
and
she
and
that
child
of
theirs
should
be
thus
disgraced
and
yet
he
expected
it
believed
it
and
after
a
fashion
he
almost
hoped
it
he
was
to
wait
at
turin
till
tidings
should
come
from
bozzle
and
after
that
he
would
go
on
to
venice
but
he
would
not
move
from
turin
till
he
should
have
received
his
first
communication
from
england
when
he
had
been
three
days
at
turin
they
came
to
him
and
among
other
letters
in
bozzle
packet
there
was
a
letter
addressed
in
his
wife
handwriting
the
letter
was
simply
directed
to
bozzle
house
in
what
possible
way
could
his
wife
have
found
out
ought
of
his
dealings
with
bozzle
where
bozzle
lived
or
could
have
learned
that
letters
intended
for
him
should
be
sent
to
the
man
own
residence
before
however
we
inspect
the
contents
of
bozzle
dispatch
we
will
go
back
and
see
how
trevelyan
had
discovered
the
manner
of
forwarding
a
letter
to
her
husband
the
matter
of
the
address
was
indeed
very
simple
all
letters
for
trevelyan
were
to
be
redirected
from
the
house
in
curzon
street
and
from
the
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
to
the
acrobats
club
to
the
porter
of
the
acrobats
club
had
been
confided
the
secret
not
of
bozzle
name
but
of
bozzle
private
address
no
stony
walk
union
street
borough
thus
all
letters
reaching
the
acrobats
were
duly
sent
to
bozzle
house
it
may
be
remembered
that
hugh
stanbury
on
the
occasion
of
his
last
visit
to
the
parsonage
of
diddulph
was
informed
that
trevelyan
had
a
letter
from
her
father
for
her
husband
and
that
she
knew
not
whither
to
send
it
it
may
well
be
that
had
the
matter
assumed
no
other
interest
in
stanbury
eyes
than
that
given
to
it
by
trevelyan
very
moderate
anxiety
to
have
the
letter
forwarded
he
would
have
thought
nothing
about
it
but
having
resolved
as
he
sat
upon
the
of
the
omnibus
the
reader
will
at
any
rate
remember
those
resolutions
made
on
the
top
of
the
omnibus
while
hugh
was
smoking
his
pipe
having
resolved
that
a
deed
should
be
done
at
diddulph
he
resolved
also
that
it
should
be
done
at
once
he
would
not
allow
the
heat
of
his
purpose
to
be
cooled
by
delay
he
would
go
to
diddulph
at
once
with
his
heart
in
his
hand
but
it
might
he
thought
be
as
well
that
he
should
have
an
excuse
for
his
visit
so
he
called
upon
the
porter
at
the
acrobats
and
was
successful
in
learning
trevelyan
address
stony
walk
union
street
borough
he
said
to
himself
wondering
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
bozzle
and
bozzle
only
among
trevelyan
friends
could
live
at
stony
walk
in
the
borough
thus
armed
he
set
out
for
diddulph
and
as
one
of
the
effects
of
his
visit
to
the
east
sir
marmaduke
note
was
forwarded
to
louis
trevelyan
at
turin
chapter
xxxix
miss
nora
rowley
is
maltreated
hugh
stanbury
when
he
reached
the
parsonage
found
no
difficulty
in
making
his
way
into
the
joint
presence
of
outhouse
trevelyan
and
nora
he
was
recognised
by
the
diddulph
party
as
one
who
had
come
over
to
their
side
as
a
friend
of
trevelyan
who
had
found
himself
constrained
to
condemn
his
friend
in
spite
of
his
friendship
and
was
consequently
very
welcome
and
there
was
no
difficulty
about
giving
the
address
the
ladies
wondered
how
it
came
to
pass
that
trevelyan
letters
should
be
sent
to
such
a
locality
and
hugh
expressed
his
surprise
also
he
thought
it
discreet
to
withhold
his
suspicions
about
bozzle
and
simply
expressed
his
conviction
that
letters
sent
in
accordance
with
the
directions
given
by
the
would
reach
their
destination
then
the
boy
was
brought
down
and
they
were
all
very
confidential
and
very
unhappy
together
trevelyan
could
see
no
end
to
the
cruelty
of
her
position
and
declared
that
her
father
anger
against
her
husband
was
so
great
that
she
anticipated
his
coming
with
almost
more
of
fear
than
of
hope
outhouse
expressed
an
opinion
that
trevelyan
must
surely
be
mad
and
nora
suggested
that
the
possibility
of
such
perversity
on
the
part
of
a
man
made
it
almost
unwise
in
any
woman
to
trust
herself
to
the
power
of
a
husband
but
there
are
not
many
like
him
thank
god
said
outhouse
bridling
in
her
wrath
thus
they
were
very
friendly
together
and
hugh
was
allowed
to
feel
that
he
stood
upon
comfortable
terms
in
the
parsonage
but
he
did
not
as
yet
see
how
he
was
to
carry
out
his
project
for
the
present
day
at
last
trevelyan
went
away
with
the
child
hugh
felt
that
he
ought
to
go
but
stayed
courageously
he
thought
he
could
perceive
that
nora
suspected
the
cause
of
his
assiduity
but
it
was
quite
evident
that
outhouse
did
not
do
so
outhouse
having
reconciled
herself
to
the
young
man
was
by
no
means
averse
to
his
presence
she
went
on
talking
about
the
wickedness
of
trevelyan
and
her
brother
anger
and
the
fate
of
the
little
boy
till
at
last
the
little
boy
mother
came
back
into
the
room
then
outhouse
went
they
must
excuse
her
for
a
few
minutes
she
said
if
only
she
would
have
gone
a
few
minutes
sooner
how
well
her
absence
might
have
been
excused
nora
understood
it
all
now
and
though
she
became
almost
breathless
she
was
not
surprised
when
hugh
got
up
from
his
chair
and
asked
her
sister
to
go
away
trevelyan
he
said
i
want
to
speak
a
few
words
to
your
sister
i
hope
you
will
give
me
the
opportunity
nora
exclaimed
trevelyan
she
knows
nothing
about
it
said
hugh
am
i
to
go
said
trevelyan
to
her
sister
but
nora
said
never
a
word
she
sat
perfectly
fixed
not
turning
her
eyes
from
the
object
on
which
she
was
gazing
illustration
am
i
to
go
pray
pray
do
said
hugh
i
can
not
think
that
it
will
be
for
any
good
said
trevelyan
but
i
know
that
she
may
be
trusted
and
i
suppose
it
ought
to
be
so
if
you
wish
it
i
do
wish
it
of
all
things
said
hugh
still
standing
up
and
almost
turning
the
elder
sister
out
of
the
room
by
the
force
of
his
look
and
voice
then
with
another
pause
of
a
moment
trevelyan
rose
from
her
chair
and
left
the
room
closing
the
door
after
her
hugh
when
he
found
that
the
coast
was
clear
for
him
immediately
began
his
task
with
a
conviction
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
he
had
told
himself
a
dozen
times
that
the
matter
was
hopeless
that
nora
had
shown
him
by
every
means
in
her
power
that
she
was
indifferent
to
him
that
she
with
all
her
friends
would
know
that
such
a
marriage
was
out
of
the
question
and
he
had
in
truth
come
to
believe
that
the
mission
which
he
had
in
hand
was
one
in
which
success
was
not
possible
but
he
thought
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
on
with
it
if
a
man
love
a
woman
even
though
it
be
the
king
and
the
reversed
though
it
be
a
beggar
and
a
queen
he
should
tell
her
of
it
if
it
be
so
she
has
a
right
to
know
it
and
to
take
her
choice
and
he
has
a
right
to
tell
her
and
to
say
what
he
can
for
himself
such
was
hugh
doctrine
in
the
matter
and
acting
upon
it
he
found
himself
alone
with
his
mistress
nora
he
said
speaking
perhaps
with
more
energy
than
the
words
required
i
have
come
here
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
and
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
nora
for
the
last
ten
minutes
had
been
thinking
that
this
would
come
that
it
would
come
at
once
and
yet
she
was
not
at
all
prepared
with
an
answer
it
was
now
weeks
since
she
had
confessed
to
herself
frankly
that
nothing
else
but
this
this
one
thing
which
was
now
happening
this
one
thing
which
had
now
happened
that
nothing
else
could
make
her
happy
or
could
touch
her
happiness
she
had
refused
a
man
whom
she
otherwise
would
have
taken
because
her
heart
had
been
given
to
hugh
stanbury
she
had
been
bold
enough
to
tell
that
other
suitor
that
it
was
so
though
she
had
not
mentioned
the
rival
name
she
had
longed
for
some
expression
of
love
from
this
man
when
they
had
been
at
nuncombe
together
and
had
been
fiercely
angry
with
him
because
no
such
expression
had
come
from
him
day
after
day
since
she
had
been
with
her
aunt
she
had
told
herself
that
she
was
a
woman
because
she
had
given
away
all
that
she
had
to
give
and
had
received
nothing
in
return
had
he
said
a
word
that
might
have
given
her
hope
how
happy
could
she
have
been
in
hoping
now
he
had
come
to
her
with
a
offer
telling
her
that
he
loved
her
and
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
and
she
was
altogether
unable
to
answer
how
could
she
consent
to
be
his
wife
knowing
as
she
did
that
there
was
no
certainty
of
an
income
on
which
they
could
live
how
could
she
tell
her
father
and
mother
that
she
had
engaged
herself
to
marry
a
man
who
might
or
might
not
make
a
year
and
who
already
had
a
mother
and
sister
depending
on
him
in
truth
had
he
come
more
gently
to
her
his
chance
of
a
happy
answer
of
an
answer
which
might
be
found
to
have
in
it
something
of
happiness
would
have
been
greater
he
might
have
said
a
word
which
she
could
not
but
have
answered
softly
and
then
from
that
constrained
softness
other
gentleness
would
have
followed
and
so
he
would
have
won
her
in
spite
of
her
discretion
she
would
have
surrendered
gradually
accepting
on
the
score
of
her
great
love
all
the
penalties
of
a
long
and
precarious
engagement
but
when
she
was
asked
to
come
and
be
his
wife
now
and
at
once
she
felt
that
in
spite
of
her
love
it
was
impossible
that
she
could
accede
to
a
request
so
sudden
so
violent
so
monstrous
he
stood
over
her
as
though
expecting
an
instant
answer
and
then
when
she
had
sat
dumb
before
him
for
a
minute
he
repeated
his
demand
tell
me
nora
can
you
love
me
if
you
knew
how
thoroughly
i
have
loved
you
you
would
at
least
feel
something
for
me
to
tell
him
that
she
did
not
love
him
was
impossible
to
her
but
how
was
she
to
refuse
him
without
telling
him
either
a
lie
or
the
truth
some
answer
she
must
give
him
and
as
to
that
matter
of
marrying
him
the
answer
must
be
a
negative
her
education
had
been
of
that
nature
which
teaches
girls
to
believe
that
it
is
a
crime
to
marry
a
man
without
an
assured
income
assured
morality
in
a
husband
is
a
great
thing
assured
good
temper
is
very
excellent
assured
talent
religion
amiability
truth
honesty
are
all
desirable
but
an
assured
income
is
indispensable
whereas
in
truth
the
income
may
come
hereafter
but
the
other
things
unless
they
be
there
already
will
hardly
be
forthcoming
stanbury
she
said
your
suddenness
has
quite
astounded
me
ah
yes
but
how
should
i
not
be
sudden
i
have
come
here
on
purpose
to
say
this
to
you
if
i
do
not
say
it
now
you
heard
what
emily
said
no
what
did
she
say
she
said
that
it
would
not
be
for
good
that
you
should
speak
to
me
thus
why
not
for
good
but
she
is
unhappy
and
looks
gloomily
at
things
yes
indeed
but
all
the
world
need
not
be
sad
for
ever
because
she
has
been
unfortunate
not
all
the
world
stanbury
but
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
it
affects
me
but
would
that
prevent
your
loving
me
if
you
did
love
me
but
nora
i
do
not
expect
you
to
love
me
not
yet
i
do
not
say
that
i
expect
it
ever
but
if
you
would
nora
i
can
do
no
more
than
tell
you
the
simple
truth
just
listen
to
me
for
a
minute
you
know
how
i
came
to
be
intimate
with
you
all
in
curzon
street
the
first
day
i
saw
you
i
loved
you
and
there
has
come
no
change
yet
it
is
months
now
since
i
first
knew
that
i
loved
you
well
i
told
myself
more
than
once
when
i
was
down
at
nuncombe
for
instance
that
i
had
no
right
to
speak
to
you
what
right
can
a
poor
devil
like
me
have
who
lives
from
hand
to
mouth
to
ask
such
a
girl
as
you
to
be
his
wife
and
so
i
said
nothing
though
it
was
on
my
lips
every
moment
that
i
was
there
nora
remembered
at
the
moment
how
she
had
looked
to
his
lips
and
had
not
seen
the
words
there
but
i
think
there
is
something
unmanly
in
this
if
you
can
not
give
me
a
grain
of
hope
if
you
tell
me
that
there
never
can
be
hope
it
is
my
misfortune
it
will
be
very
grievous
but
i
will
bear
it
but
that
will
be
better
than
puling
and
moping
about
without
daring
to
tell
my
tale
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
you
nora
and
i
think
it
best
to
come
for
an
answer
he
held
out
his
arms
as
though
he
thought
that
she
might
perhaps
come
to
him
indeed
he
had
no
idea
of
any
such
coming
on
her
part
but
she
as
she
looked
at
him
almost
thought
that
it
was
her
duty
to
go
had
she
a
right
to
withhold
herself
from
him
she
who
loved
him
so
dearly
had
he
stepped
forward
and
taken
her
in
his
arms
it
might
be
that
all
power
of
refusal
would
soon
have
been
beyond
her
power
stanbury
she
said
you
have
confessed
yourself
that
it
is
impossible
but
do
you
love
me
do
you
think
that
it
is
possible
that
you
should
ever
love
me
you
know
stanbury
that
you
should
not
say
anything
further
you
know
that
it
can
not
be
but
do
you
love
me
you
are
ungenerous
not
to
take
an
answer
without
driving
me
to
be
uncourteous
i
do
not
care
for
courtesy
tell
me
the
truth
can
you
ever
love
me
with
one
word
of
hope
i
will
wait
and
work
and
feel
myself
to
be
a
hero
i
will
not
go
till
you
tell
me
that
you
can
not
love
me
then
i
must
tell
you
so
what
is
it
you
will
tell
me
nora
speak
it
say
it
if
i
knew
that
a
girl
disliked
me
nothing
should
make
me
press
myself
upon
her
am
i
odious
to
you
nora
no
not
odious
but
very
very
unfair
i
will
have
the
truth
if
i
be
ever
so
unfair
he
said
and
by
this
time
probably
some
inkling
of
the
truth
had
reached
his
intelligence
there
was
already
a
tear
in
nora
eye
but
he
did
not
pity
her
she
owed
it
to
him
to
tell
him
the
truth
and
he
would
have
it
from
her
if
it
was
to
be
reached
nora
he
said
listen
to
me
again
all
my
heart
and
soul
are
in
this
it
is
everything
to
me
if
you
can
love
me
you
are
bound
to
say
so
by
jove
i
will
believe
you
do
unless
you
swear
to
me
that
it
is
not
so
he
was
now
holding
her
by
the
hand
and
looking
closely
into
her
face
stanbury
she
said
let
me
go
pray
pray
let
me
go
not
till
you
say
that
you
love
me
oh
nora
i
believe
that
you
love
me
you
do
yes
you
do
love
me
dearest
dearest
nora
would
you
not
say
a
word
to
make
me
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
and
now
he
had
his
arm
round
her
waist
let
me
go
she
said
struggling
through
her
tears
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
you
are
very
very
wicked
i
will
never
speak
to
you
again
nay
but
you
shall
let
me
go
and
then
she
was
out
of
his
arms
and
had
escaped
from
the
room
before
he
had
managed
to
touch
her
face
with
his
lips
as
he
was
thinking
how
he
also
might
escape
now
might
escape
and
comfort
himself
with
his
triumph
outhouse
returned
to
the
chamber
she
was
very
demure
and
her
manner
towards
him
was
considerably
changed
since
she
had
left
the
chamber
stanbury
she
said
this
kind
of
thing
must
go
any
further
indeed
at
least
not
in
my
house
what
kind
of
thing
mrs
outhouse
well
what
my
elder
niece
has
told
me
i
have
not
seen
miss
rowley
since
she
left
you
i
am
quite
sure
she
has
behaved
with
discretion
indeed
she
has
mrs
outhouse
the
fact
is
my
nieces
are
in
grief
and
trouble
and
this
is
no
time
or
place
for
i
am
sorry
to
be
uncivil
but
i
must
ask
you
not
to
come
here
any
more
i
will
stay
away
from
this
house
certainly
if
you
bid
me
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
must
bid
you
sir
marmaduke
will
be
home
in
the
spring
and
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
him
of
course
you
can
see
him
then
hugh
stanbury
took
his
leave
of
outhouse
but
as
he
went
home
again
on
the
knifeboard
of
an
omnibus
he
smoked
the
pipe
of
triumph
rather
than
the
pipe
of
contemplation
chapter
xl
the
miss
spaldings
were
met
at
the
station
at
florence
by
their
uncle
the
american
minister
by
their
cousin
the
american
secretary
of
legation
and
by
three
or
four
other
dear
friends
and
relations
who
were
there
to
welcome
the
newcomers
to
sunny
italy
glascock
therefore
who
ten
minutes
since
had
been
and
had
felt
himself
to
be
quite
indispensable
to
their
comfort
suddenly
became
as
though
he
were
nothing
and
nobody
who
is
there
that
has
not
felt
these
sudden
disruptions
to
the
intimacies
and
friendships
of
a
long
journey
he
bowed
to
them
and
they
to
him
and
then
they
were
whirled
away
in
their
grandeur
he
put
himself
into
a
small
open
and
had
himself
driven
to
the
york
hotel
feeling
himself
to
be
deserted
and
desolate
the
two
miss
spaldings
were
the
daughters
of
a
very
respectable
lawyer
at
boston
whereas
glascock
was
heir
to
a
peerage
to
an
enormous
fortune
and
to
one
of
the
finest
places
in
england
but
he
thought
nothing
of
this
at
the
time
as
he
went
he
was
meditating
which
young
woman
was
the
most
attractive
nora
rowley
or
caroline
spalding
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
nora
was
the
prettier
the
pleasanter
in
manner
the
better
dressed
the
more
engaging
in
all
that
concerned
the
outer
woman
but
he
thought
that
he
had
never
met
any
lady
who
talked
better
than
caroline
spalding
and
what
was
nora
rowley
beauty
to
him
had
she
not
told
him
that
she
was
the
property
of
some
one
else
or
for
the
matter
of
that
what
was
miss
spalding
to
him
they
had
parted
and
he
was
going
on
to
naples
in
two
days
he
had
said
some
word
as
to
calling
at
the
american
embassy
but
it
had
not
been
taken
up
by
either
of
the
ladies
he
had
not
pressed
it
and
so
they
had
parted
without
an
understanding
as
to
a
future
meeting
the
double
journey
from
turin
to
bologna
and
from
bologna
to
florence
is
very
long
and
forms
ample
time
for
a
considerable
intimacy
there
had
too
been
a
long
day
journeying
together
before
that
and
with
no
women
is
a
speedy
intimacy
so
possible
or
indeed
so
profitable
as
with
americans
they
fear
nothing
neither
you
nor
themselves
and
talk
with
as
much
freedom
as
though
they
were
men
it
may
perhaps
be
assumed
to
be
true
as
a
rule
that
women
society
is
always
more
agreeable
to
men
than
that
of
other
men
except
for
the
lack
of
ease
it
undoubtedly
is
so
when
the
women
be
young
and
pretty
there
is
a
feeling
however
among
pretty
women
in
europe
that
such
freedom
is
dangerous
and
it
is
withheld
there
is
such
danger
and
more
or
less
of
such
withholding
is
expedient
but
the
american
woman
does
not
recognise
the
danger
and
if
she
withhold
the
grace
of
her
countenance
and
the
pearls
of
her
speech
it
is
because
she
is
not
desirous
of
the
society
which
is
proffered
to
her
these
two
american
sisters
had
not
withholden
their
pearls
from
glascock
he
was
much
their
senior
in
age
he
was
gentle
in
his
manners
and
they
probably
recognised
him
to
be
a
safe
companion
they
had
no
idea
who
he
was
and
had
not
heard
his
name
when
they
parted
from
him
but
it
was
not
probable
that
they
should
have
been
with
him
so
long
and
that
they
should
leave
him
without
further
thought
of
him
without
curiosity
or
a
desire
to
know
more
of
him
they
had
seen
in
large
letters
on
his
and
that
was
all
they
had
learned
as
to
his
identity
he
had
known
their
names
well
and
had
once
called
olivia
by
hers
in
the
hurry
of
speaking
to
her
sister
he
had
apologised
and
there
had
been
a
little
laugh
and
a
discussion
about
the
use
of
christian
names
such
as
is
very
conducive
to
intimacy
between
gentlemen
and
ladies
when
you
can
talk
to
a
young
lady
about
her
own
christian
name
you
are
almost
entitled
for
the
nonce
to
use
it
glascock
went
to
his
hotel
and
was
very
moody
and
desolate
his
name
was
very
soon
known
there
and
he
received
the
honours
due
to
his
rank
and
station
i
should
like
to
travel
in
america
he
said
to
himself
if
i
could
be
sure
that
no
one
would
find
out
who
i
was
he
had
received
letters
at
turin
stating
that
his
father
was
better
and
therefore
he
intended
to
remain
two
days
at
florence
the
weather
was
still
very
hot
and
florence
in
the
middle
of
september
is
much
preferable
to
naples
that
night
when
the
two
miss
spaldings
were
alone
together
they
discussed
their
thoroughly
something
of
course
had
been
said
about
him
to
their
uncle
the
minister
to
their
aunt
the
minister
wife
and
to
their
cousin
the
secretary
of
legation
but
travellers
will
always
observe
that
the
dear
new
friends
they
have
made
on
their
journey
are
not
interesting
to
the
dear
old
friends
whom
they
meet
afterwards
there
may
be
some
touch
of
jealousy
in
this
and
then
though
you
the
traveller
are
fully
aware
that
there
has
been
something
special
in
the
case
which
has
made
this
new
friendship
more
peculiar
than
others
that
have
sprung
up
in
similar
circumstances
fathers
and
brothers
and
wives
and
sisters
do
not
see
it
in
that
light
they
suspect
perhaps
that
the
new
friend
was
a
bagman
or
an
opera
dancer
and
think
that
the
affair
need
not
be
made
of
importance
the
american
minister
had
cast
his
eye
on
glascock
during
that
momentary
parting
and
had
not
thought
much
of
glascock
he
was
certainly
a
gentleman
caroline
had
said
there
are
a
great
many
english
gentlemen
the
minister
had
replied
i
thought
you
would
have
asked
him
to
call
olivia
said
to
her
sister
he
did
offer
i
know
he
did
i
heard
it
why
did
you
tell
him
he
might
come
because
we
are
not
in
boston
livy
it
might
be
the
most
horrible
thing
in
the
world
to
do
here
in
florence
and
it
may
make
a
difference
because
uncle
jonas
is
minister
why
should
that
make
a
difference
do
you
mean
that
one
is
to
see
one
own
friends
that
must
be
nonsense
but
he
is
a
friend
livy
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
known
him
for
ever
that
soft
monotonous
voice
which
never
became
excited
and
never
disagreeable
is
as
familiar
to
me
as
though
i
had
lived
with
it
all
my
life
i
thought
him
very
pleasant
indeed
you
did
carry
and
he
thought
you
pleasant
too
does
it
seem
odd
you
were
mending
his
glove
for
him
this
very
afternoon
just
as
if
he
were
your
brother
why
should
i
mend
his
glove
why
not
indeed
he
was
entitled
to
have
everything
mended
after
getting
us
such
a
good
dinner
at
bologna
you
never
paid
him
yes
i
did
when
you
were
not
by
i
wonder
who
he
is
that
fine
man
in
the
brown
coat
was
his
servant
you
know
i
thought
at
first
that
must
have
been
cracked
and
that
the
tall
man
was
his
keeper
i
never
knew
any
one
less
like
a
madman
no
but
the
man
was
so
queer
he
did
nothing
you
know
we
hardly
saw
him
if
you
remember
at
turin
all
he
did
was
to
tie
the
shawls
at
bologna
what
can
any
man
want
with
another
man
about
with
him
like
that
unless
he
is
cracked
either
in
body
or
mind
you
better
ask
g
yourself
i
shall
never
see
again
i
suppose
i
should
like
to
see
him
again
i
guess
you
would
too
carry
eh
of
course
i
should
why
not
i
never
knew
a
man
so
imperturbable
and
who
had
yet
so
much
to
say
for
himself
i
wonder
what
he
is
perhaps
he
on
business
and
that
man
was
a
kind
of
a
clerk
he
had
livery
buttons
on
said
carry
and
does
that
make
a
difference
i
do
think
they
put
clerks
into
livery
even
in
england
nor
yet
mad
doctors
said
olivia
well
i
like
him
very
much
and
the
only
thing
against
him
is
that
he
should
have
a
man
six
feet
high
going
about
with
him
doing
nothing
you
make
me
angry
livy
if
you
talk
in
that
way
uncharitable
in
what
way
about
a
mad
doctor
it
my
belief
said
olivia
that
he
an
english
swell
a
lord
or
a
duke
and
it
my
belief
too
that
he
in
love
with
you
it
my
belief
livy
that
you
a
regular
ass
and
so
the
conversation
was
ended
on
that
occasion
on
the
next
day
about
noon
the
american
minister
as
a
part
of
the
duty
which
he
owed
to
his
country
read
in
a
publication
of
that
day
issued
for
the
purpose
the
names
of
the
new
arrivals
at
florence
first
and
foremost
was
that
of
the
honourable
charles
glascock
with
his
suite
at
the
york
hotel
en
route
to
join
his
father
lord
peterborough
at
naples
having
read
the
news
first
to
himself
the
minister
read
it
out
loud
in
the
presence
of
his
nieces
that
our
friend
said
livy
i
should
think
not
said
the
minister
who
had
his
own
ideas
about
an
english
lord
i
sure
it
is
because
of
the
tall
man
with
the
buttons
said
olivia
it
very
unlikely
said
the
secretary
of
legation
lord
peterborough
is
a
man
of
immense
wealth
very
old
indeed
they
say
he
is
dying
at
naples
this
man
is
his
eldest
son
is
that
any
reason
why
he
should
have
been
civil
to
us
asked
olivia
i
do
think
he
is
the
sort
of
man
likely
to
sit
up
in
the
banquette
and
he
would
have
posted
over
the
alps
moreover
he
had
his
suite
with
him
his
suite
was
buttons
said
olivia
only
fancy
carry
we
been
waited
on
for
two
days
by
a
lord
as
is
to
be
and
did
know
it
and
you
have
mended
the
tips
of
his
lordship
glove
but
carry
said
nothing
at
all
late
on
that
same
evening
they
met
glascock
close
to
the
duomo
under
the
shade
of
the
campanile
he
had
come
out
as
they
had
done
to
see
by
moonlight
that
loveliest
of
all
works
made
by
man
hands
they
were
with
the
minister
but
glascock
came
up
and
shook
hands
with
them
i
would
introduce
you
to
my
uncle
spalding
said
olivia
only
as
it
happens
we
have
never
yet
heard
your
name
my
name
is
glascock
said
he
smiling
then
the
introduction
was
made
and
the
american
minister
took
off
his
hat
and
was
very
affable
only
think
carry
said
olivia
when
they
were
alone
that
evening
if
you
were
to
become
the
wife
of
an
english
lord

took

at

illustration
nora
rowley
when
she
escaped
from
the
violence
of
her
lover
at
once
rushed
up
to
her
own
room
and
managed
to
fasten
herself
in
before
she
had
been
seen
by
any
one
her
elder
sister
had
at
once
gone
to
her
aunt
when
at
hugh
request
she
had
left
the
room
thinking
it
right
that
outhouse
should
know
what
was
being
done
in
her
own
house
outhouse
had
considered
the
matter
patiently
for
awhile
giving
the
lovers
the
benefit
of
her
hesitation
and
had
then
spoken
her
mind
to
stanbury
as
we
have
already
heard
he
had
upon
the
whole
been
so
well
pleased
with
what
had
occurred
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
angry
with
the
parson
wife
when
he
left
the
parsonage
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
outhouse
was
at
once
joined
by
her
elder
niece
but
nora
remained
for
a
while
alone
in
her
room
had
she
committed
herself
and
if
so
did
she
regret
it
he
had
behaved
very
badly
to
her
certainly
taking
her
by
the
hand
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
then
had
he
not
even
attempted
to
kiss
her
he
had
done
all
this
although
she
had
been
resolute
in
refusing
to
speak
to
him
one
word
of
kindness
though
she
had
told
him
with
all
the
energy
and
certainty
of
which
she
was
mistress
that
she
would
never
be
his
wife
if
a
girl
were
to
be
subjected
to
such
treatment
as
this
when
she
herself
had
been
so
firm
so
discreet
so
decided
then
indeed
it
would
be
unfit
that
a
girl
should
trust
herself
with
a
man
she
had
never
thought
that
he
had
been
such
a
one
as
that
to
her
to
lay
a
hand
on
her
in
violence
to
refuse
to
take
an
answer
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
sobbed
and
then
hid
her
face
and
was
conscious
that
in
spite
of
this
acting
before
herself
she
was
the
happiest
girl
alive
he
had
behaved
very
badly
of
course
he
had
behaved
most
wickedly
and
she
would
tell
him
so
some
day
but
was
he
not
the
dearest
fellow
living
did
ever
man
speak
with
more
absolute
conviction
of
love
in
every
tone
of
his
voice
was
it
not
the
finest
noblest
heart
that
ever
throbbed
beneath
a
waistcoat
had
not
his
very
wickedness
come
from
the
overpowering
truth
of
his
affection
for
her
she
would
never
quite
forgive
him
because
it
had
been
so
very
wrong
but
she
would
be
true
to
him
for
ever
and
ever
of
course
they
could
not
marry
what
would
she
go
to
him
and
be
a
clog
round
his
neck
and
a
weight
upon
him
for
ever
bringing
him
down
to
the
gutter
by
the
burden
of
her
own
useless
and
unworthy
self
no
she
would
never
so
injure
him
she
would
not
even
hamper
him
by
an
engagement
but
yet
she
would
be
true
to
him
she
had
an
idea
that
in
spite
of
all
her
protestations
which
as
she
looked
back
upon
them
appeared
to
her
to
have
been
louder
than
they
had
been
that
through
the
teeth
of
her
denials
something
of
the
truth
had
escaped
from
her
well
let
it
be
so
it
was
the
truth
and
why
should
he
not
know
it
then
she
pictured
to
herself
a
long
romance
in
which
the
heroine
lived
happily
on
the
simple
knowledge
that
she
had
been
beloved
and
the
reader
may
be
sure
that
in
this
romance
glascock
with
his
splendid
prospects
filled
one
of
the
characters
she
had
been
so
wretched
at
nuncombe
putney
when
she
had
felt
herself
constrained
to
admit
to
herself
that
this
man
for
whom
she
had
sacrificed
herself
did
not
care
for
her
that
she
could
not
now
but
enjoy
her
triumph
after
she
had
sobbed
upon
the
bed
she
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
smiling
and
she
would
now
press
her
hands
to
her
forehead
and
then
shake
her
tresses
and
then
clasp
her
own
left
hand
with
her
right
as
though
he
were
still
holding
it
wicked
man
why
had
he
been
so
wicked
and
so
violent
and
why
why
why
had
she
not
once
felt
his
lips
upon
her
brow
and
she
was
pleased
with
herself
her
sister
had
rebuked
her
because
she
had
refused
to
make
her
fortune
by
marrying
glascock
and
to
own
the
truth
she
had
rebuked
herself
on
the
same
score
when
she
found
that
hugh
stanbury
had
not
had
a
word
of
love
to
say
to
her
it
was
not
that
she
regretted
the
grandeur
which
she
had
lost
but
that
she
should
even
within
her
own
thoughts
with
the
consciousness
of
her
own
bosom
have
declared
herself
unable
to
receive
another
devotion
because
of
her
love
for
this
man
who
neglected
her
now
she
was
proud
of
herself
whether
it
might
be
accounted
as
good
or
that
she
had
ever
seen
hugh
stanbury
it
must
at
any
rate
be
right
that
she
should
be
true
to
him
now
that
she
had
seen
him
and
had
loved
him
to
know
that
she
loved
and
that
she
was
not
loved
again
had
nearly
killed
her
but
such
was
not
her
lot
she
too
had
been
successful
with
her
quarry
and
had
struck
her
game
and
brought
down
her
dear
he
had
been
very
violent
with
her
but
his
violence
had
at
least
made
the
matter
clear
he
did
love
her
she
would
be
satisfied
with
that
and
would
endeavour
so
to
live
that
that
alone
should
make
life
happy
for
her
how
should
she
get
his
photograph
and
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
when
again
might
she
have
the
pleasure
of
placing
her
own
hand
within
his
great
rough
violent
grasp
then
she
kissed
the
hand
which
he
had
held
and
opened
the
door
of
her
room
at
which
her
sister
was
now
knocking
nora
dear
will
you
not
come
down
not
yet
emily
very
soon
i
will
and
what
has
happened
dearest
there
is
nothing
to
tell
emily
there
must
be
something
to
tell
what
did
he
say
to
you
of
course
you
know
what
he
said
and
what
answer
did
you
make
i
told
him
that
it
could
not
be
and
did
he
take
that
as
final
nora
of
course
not
what
man
ever
takes
a
no
as
final
when
you
said
no
to
glascock
he
took
it
that
was
different
emily
but
how
different
i
do
see
the
difference
except
that
if
you
could
have
brought
yourself
to
like
glascock
it
would
have
been
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
for
you
and
for
all
of
them
would
you
have
me
take
a
man
emily
that
i
did
care
one
straw
for
merely
because
he
was
a
lord
you
ca
mean
that
i
not
talking
about
glascock
now
nora
yes
you
are
and
what
the
use
he
is
gone
and
there
an
end
of
it
and
is
stanbury
gone
of
course
in
the
same
way
asked
trevelyan
how
can
i
tell
about
his
ways
no
it
is
not
in
the
same
way
there
he
went
in
a
very
different
way
how
was
it
different
nora
oh
so
different
i
ca
tell
you
how
glascock
will
never
come
back
again
and
stanbury
will
said
the
elder
sister
nora
made
no
reply
but
after
a
while
nodded
her
head
and
you
want
him
to
come
back
she
paused
again
and
again
nodded
her
head
then
you
have
accepted
him
i
have
not
accepted
him
i
have
refused
him
i
have
told
him
that
it
was
impossible
and
yet
you
wish
him
back
again
nora
again
nodded
her
head
that
is
a
state
of
things
i
can
not
at
all
understand
said
trevelyan
and
would
not
believe
unless
you
told
me
so
yourself
and
you
think
me
very
wrong
of
course
i
will
endeavour
to
do
nothing
wrong
but
it
is
so
i
have
not
said
a
word
of
encouragement
to
stanbury
but
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
ought
i
to
tell
you
a
lie
when
you
question
me
or
is
it
natural
that
i
should
never
wish
to
see
again
a
person
whom
i
love
better
than
all
the
world
it
seems
to
me
that
a
girl
can
hardly
be
right
if
she
have
any
choice
of
her
own
here
are
two
men
one
rich
and
the
other
poor
i
shall
fall
to
the
ground
between
them
i
know
that
i
have
fallen
to
the
ground
already
i
like
the
one
i
ca
marry
i
do
care
a
straw
for
the
one
who
could
give
me
a
grand
house
that
is
falling
to
the
ground
but
i
do
see
that
it
is
hard
to
understand
or
that
i
have
disgraced
myself
i
said
nothing
of
disgrace
nora
but
you
looked
it
i
did
not
intend
to
look
it
dearest
and
remember
this
emily
i
have
told
you
everything
because
you
asked
me
i
do
not
mean
to
tell
anybody
else
at
all
mamma
would
not
understand
me
i
have
not
told
him
and
i
shall
not
you
mean
mr
stanbury
yes
i
mean
stanbury
as
to
glascock
of
course
i
shall
tell
mamma
that
i
have
no
secret
there
that
is
his
secret
and
i
suppose
mamma
should
know
it
but
i
will
have
nothing
told
about
the
other
had
i
accepted
him
or
even
hinted
to
him
that
i
cared
for
him
i
would
tell
mamma
at
once
after
that
there
came
something
of
a
lecture
or
something
rather
of
admonition
from
outhouse
that
lady
did
not
attempt
to
upbraid
or
to
find
any
fault
but
observed
that
as
she
understood
that
stanbury
had
no
means
whatever
and
as
nora
herself
had
none
there
had
better
be
no
further
intercourse
between
them
till
at
any
rate
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
should
be
in
london
so
i
told
him
that
he
must
not
come
here
any
more
my
dear
said
outhouse
you
are
quite
right
aunt
he
ought
not
to
come
here
i
am
so
glad
that
you
agree
with
me
i
agree
with
you
altogether
i
think
i
was
bound
to
see
him
when
he
asked
to
see
me
but
the
thing
is
altogether
out
of
the
question
i
do
think
he
come
any
more
aunt
then
outhouse
was
quite
satisfied
that
no
harm
had
been
done
a
month
had
now
passed
since
anything
had
been
heard
at
diddulph
from
trevelyan
and
it
seemed
that
many
months
might
go
on
in
the
same
dull
way
when
trevelyan
first
found
herself
in
her
uncle
house
a
sum
of
two
hundred
pounds
had
been
sent
to
her
and
since
that
she
had
received
a
letter
from
her
lawyer
saying
that
a
similar
amount
would
be
sent
to
her
every
three
months
as
long
as
she
was
separated
from
her
husband
a
portion
of
this
she
had
given
over
to
outhouse
but
this
pecuniary
assistance
by
no
means
comforted
that
unfortunate
gentleman
in
his
trouble
i
do
want
to
get
into
debt
he
said
by
keeping
a
lot
of
people
whom
i
have
the
means
to
feed
and
i
do
want
to
board
and
lodge
my
nieces
and
their
family
at
so
much
a
head
it
very
hard
upon
me
either
way
and
so
it
was
all
the
comfort
of
his
home
was
destroyed
and
he
was
driven
to
sacrifice
his
independence
by
paying
his
tradesmen
with
a
portion
of
trevelyan
money
the
more
he
thought
of
it
all
and
the
more
he
discussed
the
matter
with
his
wife
the
more
indignant
they
became
with
the
truant
husband
i
ca
believe
he
said
but
what
bideawhile
could
make
him
come
back
if
he
chose
to
do
his
duty
but
they
say
that
trevelyan
is
in
italy
my
dear
and
if
i
went
to
italy
might
i
leave
you
to
starve
and
take
my
income
with
me
he
does
leave
her
quite
to
starve
my
dear
but
is
a
man
bound
to
stay
with
his
wife
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
never
and
i
sure
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
a
man
ca
go
away
and
leave
his
wife
to
live
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
it
is
right
but
what
can
we
do
outhouse
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
nothing
could
be
done
he
was
a
man
to
whom
the
quiescence
of
his
own
childless
house
was
the
one
pleasure
of
his
existence
and
of
that
he
was
robbed
because
this
wicked
madman
chose
to
neglect
all
his
duties
and
leave
his
wife
without
a
house
to
shelter
her
supposing
that
she
could
have
come
here
what
then
said
outhouse
i
did
tell
him
as
plain
as
words
could
speak
that
we
could
receive
them
but
here
they
are
said
outhouse
and
here
they
must
remain
till
my
brother
comes
to
england
it
the
most
monstrous
thing
that
i
ever
heard
of
in
all
my
life
said
outhouse
he
ought
to
be
locked
up
that
what
he
ought
it
was
hard
and
it
became
harder
when
a
gentleman
whom
outhouse
certainly
did
not
wish
to
see
called
upon
him
about
the
latter
end
of
september
outhouse
was
sitting
alone
in
the
gloomy
parlour
of
his
parsonage
for
his
own
study
had
been
given
up
to
other
things
since
this
great
inroad
had
been
made
upon
his
family
he
was
sitting
alone
on
one
saturday
morning
preparing
for
the
duties
of
the
next
day
with
various
manuscript
sermons
lying
on
the
table
around
him
when
he
was
told
that
a
gentleman
had
called
to
see
him
had
outhouse
been
an
incumbent
at
the
of
london
or
had
his
maid
been
a
servant
in
all
probability
the
gentleman
name
would
have
been
demanded
but
outhouse
was
a
man
who
was
not
very
ready
in
foreseeing
and
preventing
misfortunes
and
the
girl
who
opened
the
door
was
not
trained
to
discreet
usages
in
such
matters
as
she
announced
the
fact
that
there
was
a
gentleman
she
pointed
to
the
door
to
show
that
the
gentleman
was
there
and
before
outhouse
had
been
able
to
think
whether
it
would
be
prudent
for
him
to
make
some
preliminary
inquiry
colonel
osborne
was
in
the
room
now
as
it
happened
these
two
men
had
never
hitherto
met
each
other
though
one
was
the
of
sir
marmaduke
rowley
and
the
other
had
been
his
very
old
friend
my
name
outhouse
is
colonel
osborne
said
the
visitor
coming
forward
with
his
hand
out
the
clergyman
of
course
took
his
hand
and
asked
him
to
be
seated
we
have
known
each
other
names
very
long
continued
the
colonel
though
i
do
not
think
we
have
ever
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
illustration
at
st
diddulph
no
said
outhouse
we
have
never
been
acquainted
i
believe
he
might
have
added
that
he
had
no
desire
whatever
to
make
such
acquaintance
and
his
manner
over
which
he
himself
had
no
control
did
almost
say
as
much
indeed
this
coming
to
his
house
of
the
suspected
lover
of
his
niece
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
heavy
addition
to
his
troubles
for
although
he
was
disposed
to
take
his
part
against
her
husband
to
any
possible
length
even
to
the
locking
up
of
the
husband
as
a
madman
if
it
were
possible
nevertheless
he
had
almost
as
great
a
horror
of
the
colonel
as
though
the
allegation
as
to
the
lover
had
been
true
as
gospel
because
trevelyan
had
been
wrong
altogether
colonel
osborne
was
not
the
less
wrong
because
trevelyan
suspicions
were
to
outhouse
wicked
and
groundless
he
did
not
the
less
regard
the
presumed
lover
to
be
an
iniquitous
roaring
lion
going
about
seeking
whom
he
might
devour
elderly
unmarried
men
of
fashion
generally
and
especially
colonels
and
majors
and
members
of
parliament
and
such
like
were
to
him
as
black
sheep
or
roaring
lions
they
were
fruges
consumere
nati
men
who
stood
on
club
doorsteps
talking
naughtily
and
doing
nothing
wearing
sleek
clothing
for
which
they
very
often
did
not
pay
and
never
going
to
church
it
seemed
to
him
in
his
ignorance
that
such
men
had
none
of
the
burdens
of
this
world
upon
their
shoulders
and
that
therefore
they
stood
in
great
peril
of
the
burdens
of
the
next
it
was
doubtless
his
special
duty
to
deal
with
men
in
such
peril
but
those
wicked
ones
with
whom
he
was
concerned
were
those
whom
he
could
reach
now
the
colonel
osbornes
of
the
earth
were
not
to
be
got
at
by
any
clergyman
or
as
far
as
outhouse
could
see
by
any
means
of
grace
that
story
of
the
rich
man
and
the
camel
seemed
to
him
to
be
specially
applicable
to
such
people
how
was
such
a
one
as
colonel
osborne
to
be
shewn
the
way
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
to
outhouse
his
own
sir
marmaduke
was
almost
of
the
same
class
for
he
frequented
clubs
when
in
london
and
played
whist
and
talked
of
the
things
of
the
world
such
as
the
derby
and
the
levées
and
dinner
parties
as
though
they
were
all
in
all
to
him
he
to
be
sure
was
weighted
with
so
large
a
family
that
there
might
be
hope
for
him
the
eye
of
the
needle
could
not
be
closed
against
him
as
a
rich
man
but
he
savoured
of
the
and
was
worldly
and
consorted
with
such
men
as
this
colonel
osborne
when
colonel
osborne
introduced
himself
to
outhouse
it
was
almost
as
though
apollyon
had
made
his
way
into
the
parsonage
of
diddulph
outhouse
said
the
colonel
i
have
thought
it
best
to
come
to
you
the
very
moment
that
i
got
back
to
town
from
scotland
outhouse
bowed
and
was
bethinking
himself
slowly
what
manner
of
speech
he
would
adopt
i
leave
town
again
for
dorsetshire
i
am
going
down
to
my
friends
the
brambers
for
partridge
shooting
outhouse
knitted
his
thick
brows
in
further
inward
condemnation
partridge
shooting
yes
this
was
september
and
partridge
shooting
would
be
the
probable
care
and
occupation
of
such
a
man
at
such
a
time
a
man
without
a
duty
in
the
world
perhaps
added
to
this
there
was
a
feeling
that
whereas
colonel
osborne
could
shoot
scotch
grouse
in
august
and
dorsetshire
partridges
in
september
and
go
about
throughout
the
whole
year
like
a
roaring
lion
he
outhouse
was
forced
to
remain
at
from
january
to
december
with
the
exception
of
one
small
parson
week
spent
at
margate
for
the
benefit
of
his
wife
health
if
there
was
such
a
thought
or
rather
such
a
feeling
who
will
say
that
it
was
not
natural
but
i
could
not
go
through
london
without
seeing
you
continued
the
colonel
this
is
a
most
frightful
infatuation
of
trevelyan
very
frightful
indeed
said
outhouse
and
on
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
not
the
slightest
cause
in
the
world
you
are
old
enough
to
be
the
lady
father
said
outhouse
managing
in
that
to
get
one
blow
at
the
gallant
colonel
just
so
god
bless
my
soul
outhouse
shrunk
visibly
at
this
profane
allusion
to
the
colonel
soul
why
i
known
her
father
ever
so
many
years
as
you
say
i
might
almost
be
her
father
myself
as
far
as
age
went
such
certainly
might
have
been
the
case
for
the
colonel
was
older
than
sir
marmaduke
look
here
outhouse
here
is
a
letter
i
got
from
emily
from
mrs
trevelyan
yes
from
trevelyan
and
as
well
as
i
can
understand
it
must
have
been
sent
to
me
by
trevelyan
himself
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
and
now
i
told
he
has
gone
away
nobody
knows
where
and
has
left
her
here
he
has
gone
away
nobody
knows
where
of
course
i
do
ask
to
see
her
it
would
be
imprudent
colonel
osborne
and
could
not
be
permitted
in
this
house
i
do
ask
it
i
have
known
emily
trevelyan
since
she
was
an
infant
and
have
always
loved
her
i
her
godfather
for
aught
i
know
though
one
forgets
things
of
that
sort
outhouse
again
knit
his
eyebrows
and
shuddered
visibly
she
and
i
have
been
fast
friends
and
why
not
but
of
course
i
ca
interfere
if
you
ask
me
colonel
osborne
i
should
say
that
you
can
do
nothing
in
the
matter
except
to
remain
away
from
her
when
sir
marmaduke
is
in
england
you
can
see
him
if
you
please
see
him
of
course
i
shall
see
him
and
by
george
louis
trevelyan
will
have
to
see
him
too
i
should
like
to
have
to
stand
up
before
rowley
if
i
had
treated
a
daughter
of
his
in
such
a
fashion
you
know
rowley
of
course
oh
yes
i
know
him
he
not
the
sort
of
man
to
bear
this
sort
of
thing
he
about
tear
trevelyan
in
pieces
if
he
gets
hold
of
him
god
bless
my
soul
the
eyebrows
went
to
work
again
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
does
he
pay
anything
for
them
mr
outhouse
this
was
dreadful
to
the
poor
clergyman
that
is
a
subject
which
we
surely
need
not
discuss
said
he
then
he
remembered
that
such
speech
on
his
part
was
like
to
a
subterfuge
and
he
found
it
necessary
to
put
himself
right
i
am
repaid
for
the
maintenance
here
of
my
nieces
and
the
little
boy
and
their
attendants
i
do
not
know
why
the
question
should
be
asked
but
such
is
the
fact
then
they
are
here
by
agreement
between
you
and
him
no
sir
they
are
not
there
is
no
such
agreement
but
i
do
not
like
these
interrogatives
from
a
stranger
as
to
matters
which
should
be
private
you
can
not
wonder
at
my
interest
mr
outhouse
you
had
better
restrain
it
sir
till
sir
marmaduke
arrives
i
shall
then
wash
my
hands
of
the
affair
and
she
is
pretty
well
emily
i
mean
trevelyan
health
is
good
pray
tell
her
though
i
could
not
might
not
ask
to
see
her
i
came
to
inquire
after
her
the
first
moment
that
i
was
in
london
pray
tell
her
how
much
i
feel
for
her
but
she
will
know
that
when
sir
marmaduke
is
here
of
course
we
shall
meet
when
she
is
once
more
under
her
father
wing
she
need
not
be
restrained
by
any
absurd
commands
from
a
husband
who
has
deserted
her
at
present
of
course
i
do
not
ask
to
see
her
of
course
you
do
not
colonel
osborne
and
give
my
love
to
nora
dear
little
nora
there
can
be
no
reason
why
she
and
i
should
not
shake
hands
i
should
prefer
that
it
should
not
be
so
in
this
house
said
the
clergyman
who
was
now
standing
in
expectation
that
his
unwelcome
guest
would
go
very
well
so
be
it
but
you
will
understand
i
could
not
be
in
london
without
coming
and
asking
after
them
then
the
colonel
at
last
took
his
leave
and
outhouse
was
left
to
his
solitude
and
his
sermons
outhouse
was
very
angry
when
she
heard
of
the
visit
men
of
that
sort
she
said
think
it
a
fine
thing
and
talk
about
it
i
believe
the
poor
girl
is
as
innocent
as
i
am
but
he
is
innocent
he
likes
it
is
easier
said
outhouse
solemnly
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
god
i
do
know
that
he
is
a
rich
man
said
outhouse
but
he
would
have
come
here
if
he
had
been
honest
trevelyan
was
told
of
the
visit
and
simply
said
that
of
course
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
have
seen
colonel
osborne
nevertheless
she
seemed
to
think
it
quite
natural
that
he
should
have
called
and
defended
him
with
some
energy
when
her
aunt
declared
that
he
had
been
much
to
blame
he
is
not
bound
to
obey
trevelyan
because
i
am
said
emily
he
is
bound
to
abstain
from
evil
doing
said
outhouse
and
he
ought
to
have
come
there
let
that
be
enough
my
dear
your
uncle
does
wish
to
have
it
talked
about
nevertheless
it
was
talked
about
between
the
two
sisters
nora
was
of
opinion
that
colonel
osborne
had
been
wrong
whereas
emily
defended
him
it
seems
to
me
to
have
been
the
most
natural
thing
in
life
said
she
had
colonel
osborne
made
the
visit
as
sir
marmaduke
friend
feeling
himself
to
be
an
old
man
it
might
have
been
natural
when
a
man
has
come
to
regard
himself
as
being
on
the
score
of
age
about
as
fit
to
be
a
young
lady
lover
as
though
he
were
an
old
woman
instead
of
an
old
man
which
some
men
will
do
when
they
are
younger
even
than
was
colonel
osborne
he
is
justified
in
throwing
behind
him
as
utterly
absurd
the
suspicions
of
other
people
but
colonel
osborne
can
not
be
defended
altogether
on
that
plea
chapter
xlii
miss
stanbury
and
gibson
become
two
there
came
to
be
a
very
gloomy
fortnight
at
miss
stanbury
house
in
the
close
for
two
or
three
days
after
gibson
dismissal
at
the
hands
of
miss
stanbury
herself
brooke
burgess
was
still
in
the
house
and
his
presence
saved
dorothy
from
the
full
weight
of
her
aunt
displeasure
there
was
the
necessity
of
looking
after
brooke
and
scolding
him
and
of
praising
him
to
martha
and
of
dispraising
him
and
of
seeing
that
he
had
enough
to
eat
and
of
watching
whether
he
smoked
in
the
house
and
of
quarrelling
with
him
about
everything
under
the
sun
which
together
so
employed
miss
stanbury
that
she
satisfied
herself
with
glances
at
dorothy
which
were
felt
to
be
full
of
charges
of
ingratitude
dorothy
was
thankful
that
it
should
be
so
and
bore
the
glances
with
abject
submission
and
then
there
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
in
brooke
friendship
on
the
second
day
after
gibson
had
gone
she
found
herself
talking
to
brooke
quite
openly
upon
the
subject
the
fact
was
burgess
that
i
did
really
care
for
him
i
know
he
very
good
and
all
that
and
of
course
aunt
stanbury
meant
it
all
for
the
best
and
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
could
but
i
could
brooke
patted
her
on
the
back
not
in
the
flesh
but
in
the
spirit
and
told
her
that
she
was
quite
right
and
he
expressed
an
opinion
too
that
it
was
not
expedient
to
yield
too
much
to
aunt
stanbury
i
would
yield
to
her
in
anything
that
was
possible
to
me
said
dorothy
i
wo
said
he
and
i
do
think
i
should
do
any
good
if
i
did
i
like
her
and
i
like
her
money
but
i
do
like
either
well
enough
to
sell
myself
for
a
price
a
great
part
too
of
the
quarrelling
which
went
on
from
day
to
day
between
brooke
and
miss
stanbury
was
due
to
the
difference
of
their
opinions
respecting
dorothy
and
her
suitor
i
believe
you
put
her
up
to
it
said
aunt
stanbury
i
neither
put
her
up
nor
down
but
i
think
that
she
was
quite
right
you
robbed
her
of
a
husband
and
she
never
have
another
chance
after
what
you
done
you
ought
to
take
her
yourself
i
shall
be
ready
said
brooke
how
can
you
tell
such
a
lie
said
aunt
stanbury
but
after
two
or
three
days
brooke
was
gone
to
make
a
journey
through
the
distant
part
of
the
county
and
see
the
beauties
of
devonshire
he
was
to
be
away
for
a
fortnight
and
then
come
back
for
a
day
or
two
before
he
returned
to
london
during
that
fortnight
things
did
not
go
well
with
poor
dorothy
at
exeter
i
suppose
you
know
your
own
business
best
her
aunt
said
to
her
one
morning
dorothy
uttered
no
word
of
reply
she
felt
it
to
be
equally
impossible
to
suggest
either
that
she
did
or
that
she
did
not
know
her
own
business
best
there
may
be
reasons
which
i
understand
exclaimed
aunt
stanbury
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
is
you
expect
why
should
i
expect
anything
aunt
stanbury
that
nonsense
everybody
expects
something
you
expect
to
have
your
dinner
do
you
i
suppose
i
shall
said
dorothy
to
whom
it
occurred
at
the
moment
that
such
expectation
was
justified
by
the
fact
that
on
every
day
of
her
life
hitherto
some
sort
of
a
dinner
had
come
in
her
way
yes
and
you
think
it
comes
from
heaven
i
suppose
it
comes
by
god
goodness
and
your
bounty
aunt
stanbury
and
how
will
it
come
when
i
dead
or
how
will
it
come
if
things
should
go
in
such
a
way
that
i
ca
stay
here
any
longer
you
ever
think
of
that
i
should
go
back
to
mamma
and
priscilla
psha
as
if
two
mouths
were
not
enough
to
eat
all
the
meal
there
is
in
that
tub
if
there
was
a
word
to
say
against
the
man
i
ask
you
to
have
him
if
he
drank
or
smoked
or
was
a
gentleman
or
was
too
poor
or
anything
you
like
but
there
nothing
it
all
very
well
to
tell
me
you
do
love
him
but
why
do
you
love
him
i
do
like
a
girl
to
go
and
throw
herself
at
a
man
head
as
those
frenches
have
done
but
when
everything
has
been
prepared
for
you
and
made
proper
it
seems
to
me
to
be
like
turning
away
from
good
victuals
dorothy
could
only
offer
to
go
home
if
she
had
offended
her
aunt
and
then
miss
stanbury
scolded
her
for
making
the
offer
as
this
kind
of
thing
went
on
at
the
house
in
the
close
for
a
fortnight
during
which
there
was
no
going
out
and
no
society
at
home
dorothy
began
to
be
rather
tired
of
it
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
brooke
burgess
was
expected
back
dorothy
slowly
moving
into
the
sitting
room
with
her
usual
melancholy
air
found
gibson
talking
to
her
aunt
there
she
is
herself
said
miss
stanbury
jumping
up
briskly
and
now
you
can
speak
to
her
of
course
i
have
no
authority
none
in
the
least
but
she
knows
what
my
wishes
are
and
having
so
spoken
miss
stanbury
left
the
room
it
will
be
remembered
that
hitherto
no
word
of
affection
had
been
whispered
by
gibson
into
dorothy
ears
when
he
came
before
to
press
his
suit
she
had
been
made
aware
of
his
coming
and
had
fled
leaving
her
answer
with
her
aunt
gibson
had
then
expressed
himself
as
somewhat
injured
in
that
no
opportunity
of
pouring
forth
his
own
eloquence
had
been
permitted
to
him
on
that
occasion
miss
stanbury
being
in
a
snubbing
humour
had
snubbed
him
she
had
in
truth
scolded
him
almost
as
much
as
she
had
scolded
dorothy
telling
him
that
he
went
about
the
business
in
hand
as
though
butter
melt
in
his
mouth
you
stiff
as
a
she
had
said
to
him
with
a
few
other
compliments
and
these
amenities
had
for
a
while
made
him
regard
the
establishment
at
heavitree
as
being
at
any
rate
pleasanter
than
that
in
the
close
but
since
that
cool
reflection
had
come
the
proposal
was
not
that
he
should
marry
miss
stanbury
senior
who
certainly
could
be
severe
on
occasions
but
miss
stanbury
junior
whose
temper
was
as
sweet
as
primroses
in
march
that
which
he
would
have
to
take
from
miss
stanbury
senior
was
a
certain
sum
of
money
as
to
which
her
promise
was
as
good
as
any
bond
in
the
world
things
had
come
to
such
a
pass
with
him
in
exeter
from
the
hints
of
his
friend
the
prebend
from
a
word
or
two
which
had
come
to
him
from
the
dean
from
certain
family
arrangements
proposed
to
him
by
his
mother
and
sisters
things
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
he
was
of
a
mind
that
he
had
better
marry
some
one
he
had
as
it
were
three
strings
to
his
bow
there
were
the
two
french
strings
and
there
was
dorothy
he
had
not
breadth
of
genius
enough
to
suggest
to
himself
that
yet
another
woman
might
be
found
there
was
a
difficulty
on
the
french
score
even
about
miss
stanbury
but
it
was
clear
to
him
that
failing
her
he
was
due
to
one
of
the
two
miss
frenches
now
it
was
not
only
that
the
miss
frenches
were
but
he
was
beginning
to
think
himself
that
they
were
not
as
nice
as
they
might
have
been
in
reference
to
the
arrangement
of
their
therefore
having
given
much
thought
to
the
matter
and
remembering
that
he
had
never
yet
had
play
for
his
own
eloquence
with
dorothy
he
had
come
to
miss
stanbury
asking
that
he
might
have
another
chance
it
had
been
borne
in
upon
him
that
he
had
perhaps
hitherto
regarded
dorothy
as
too
certainly
his
own
since
she
had
been
offered
to
him
by
her
aunt
as
being
a
prize
that
required
no
eloquence
in
the
winning
and
he
thought
that
if
he
could
have
an
opportunity
of
amending
that
fault
it
might
even
yet
be
well
with
his
suit
so
he
prepared
himself
and
asked
permission
and
now
found
himself
alone
with
the
young
lady
when
last
i
was
in
this
house
miss
stanbury
he
began
i
was
not
fortunate
enough
to
be
allowed
an
opportunity
of
pleading
my
cause
to
yourself
then
he
paused
and
dorothy
was
left
to
consider
how
best
she
might
answer
him
all
that
her
aunt
had
said
to
her
had
not
been
thrown
away
upon
her
the
calls
upon
that
slender
at
home
she
knew
were
quite
sufficient
and
gibson
was
she
believed
a
good
man
and
how
better
could
she
dispose
of
herself
in
life
and
what
was
she
that
she
should
scorn
the
love
of
an
honest
gentleman
she
would
take
him
she
thought
if
she
could
but
then
there
came
upon
her
unconsciously
without
work
of
thought
by
instinct
rather
than
by
intelligence
a
feeling
of
the
closeness
of
a
wife
to
her
husband
looking
at
it
in
general
she
could
not
deny
that
it
would
be
very
proper
that
she
should
become
gibson
but
when
there
came
upon
her
a
remembrance
that
she
would
be
called
upon
for
demonstration
of
her
love
that
he
would
embrace
her
and
hold
her
to
his
heart
and
kiss
her
she
revolted
and
shuddered
she
believed
that
she
did
not
want
to
marry
any
man
and
that
such
a
state
of
things
would
not
be
good
for
her
dear
young
lady
continued
gibson
you
will
let
me
now
make
up
for
the
loss
which
i
then
experienced
i
thought
it
was
better
not
to
give
you
trouble
said
dorothy
trouble
miss
stanbury
how
could
it
be
trouble
the
labour
we
delight
in
physics
pain
but
to
go
back
to
the
i
hope
you
do
not
doubt
that
my
affection
for
you
is
true
and
honest
and
genuine
i
do
want
to
doubt
anything
gibson
but
you
need
dearest
miss
stanbury
indeed
you
need
if
you
could
read
my
heart
you
would
see
written
there
true
love
very
plainly
very
plainly
and
do
you
not
think
it
a
duty
that
people
should
marry
it
may
be
surmised
that
he
had
here
forgotten
some
connecting
link
which
should
have
joined
without
abruptness
the
declaration
of
his
own
love
and
his
social
view
as
to
the
general
expediency
of
matrimony
but
dorothy
did
not
discover
the
hiatus
certainly
when
they
like
each
other
and
if
their
friends
think
it
proper
our
friends
think
it
proper
miss
stanbury
may
i
say
dorothy
all
of
them
i
can
assure
you
that
on
my
side
you
will
be
welcomed
by
a
mother
and
sisters
only
too
anxious
to
receive
you
with
open
arms
and
as
regards
your
own
relations
i
need
hardly
allude
to
your
revered
aunt
as
to
your
own
mother
and
sister
and
your
brother
who
i
believe
gives
his
mind
chiefly
to
other
things
i
am
assured
by
miss
stanbury
that
no
opposition
need
be
feared
from
them
is
that
true
dearest
dorothy
it
is
true
does
not
all
that
plead
in
my
behalf
tell
me
dorothy
of
course
it
does
and
you
will
be
mine
as
far
as
eloquence
could
be
of
service
gibson
was
sufficiently
eloquent
to
dorothy
his
words
appeared
good
and
true
and
affecting
all
their
friends
did
wish
it
there
were
many
reasons
why
it
should
be
done
if
talking
could
have
done
it
his
talking
was
good
enough
though
his
words
were
in
truth
cold
and
affected
and
learned
by
rote
they
did
not
offend
her
but
his
face
offended
her
and
the
feeling
was
strong
within
her
that
if
she
yielded
it
would
soon
be
close
to
her
own
she
could
do
it
she
did
love
him
and
she
would
do
it
priscilla
would
not
grudge
her
her
share
out
of
that
meagre
had
not
priscilla
told
her
not
to
marry
the
man
if
she
did
not
love
him
she
found
that
she
was
further
than
ever
from
loving
him
she
would
not
do
it
say
that
you
will
be
mine
pleaded
gibson
coming
to
her
with
both
his
hands
outstretched
gibson
i
ca
she
said
she
was
sobbing
now
and
was
half
choked
by
tears
and
why
not
dorothy
i
do
know
but
i
ca
i
do
feel
that
i
want
to
be
married
at
all
but
it
is
honourable
it
no
use
gibson
i
ca
and
you
ought
to
ask
me
any
more
must
this
be
your
very
last
answer
what
the
good
of
going
over
it
all
again
and
again
i
ca
do
it
never
miss
stanbury
no
never
that
is
cruel
very
cruel
i
fear
that
you
doubt
my
love
it
is
cruel
gibson
i
have
a
right
to
have
my
own
feelings
and
i
ca
if
you
please
i
go
away
now
then
she
went
and
he
was
left
standing
alone
in
the
room
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
anger
then
there
came
to
be
mixed
with
that
a
good
deal
of
wonder
and
then
a
certain
amount
of
doubt
he
had
during
the
last
fortnight
discussed
the
matter
at
great
length
with
a
friend
a
gentleman
who
knew
the
world
and
who
took
upon
himself
to
say
that
he
specially
understood
female
nature
it
was
by
advice
from
this
friend
that
he
had
been
instigated
to
plead
his
own
cause
of
course
she
means
to
accept
you
the
friend
had
said
why
the
mischief
should
she
but
she
has
some
flimsy
country
idea
that
it
is
maidenly
to
give
in
at
first
you
tell
her
roundly
that
she
must
marry
you
gibson
was
just
reaching
that
roundness
which
his
friend
had
recommended
when
the
lady
left
him
and
he
was
alone
gibson
was
no
doubt
very
much
in
love
with
dorothy
stanbury
so
much
we
may
take
for
granted
he
at
least
believed
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
he
would
have
thought
it
wicked
to
propose
to
her
had
he
not
been
in
love
with
her
but
with
his
love
was
mingled
a
certain
amount
of
contempt
which
had
induced
him
to
look
upon
her
as
an
easy
conquest
he
had
been
perhaps
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
for
being
in
love
with
dorothy
and
had
almost
believed
the
frenches
when
they
had
spoken
of
her
as
a
poor
creature
a
dependant
one
born
to
be
snubbed
as
a
young
woman
almost
without
an
identity
of
her
own
when
therefore
she
so
pertinaciously
refused
him
he
could
not
but
be
angry
and
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
surprised
though
he
was
to
have
received
a
fortune
with
dorothy
the
money
was
not
hers
it
was
to
be
hers
or
rather
theirs
only
if
she
would
accept
him
gibson
thoroughly
understood
this
point
he
knew
that
dorothy
had
nothing
of
her
own
the
proposal
made
to
her
was
as
rich
as
though
he
had
sought
her
down
at
nuncombe
putney
with
his
preferment
plus
the
in
his
own
pocket
and
his
other
advantages
were
not
hidden
from
his
own
eyes
he
was
a
clergyman
well
thought
of
not
certainly
considerably
under
forty
a
man
indeed
who
ought
to
have
been
in
the
eyes
of
dorothy
such
an
orlando
as
she
would
have
most
desired
he
could
not
therefore
but
wonder
and
then
came
the
doubt
could
it
be
possible
that
all
those
refusals
were
simply
the
early
pulses
of
hesitating
compliance
produced
by
maidenly
reserve
gibson
friend
had
expressed
a
strong
opinion
that
almost
any
young
woman
would
accept
any
young
man
if
he
put
his
com
upon
her
strong
enough
for
gibson
friend
was
an
irishman
as
to
dorothy
the
friend
had
not
a
doubt
in
the
world
gibson
as
he
stood
alone
in
the
room
after
dorothy
departure
could
not
share
his
friend
certainty
but
he
thought
it
just
possible
that
the
pulsations
of
maidenly
reserve
were
yet
at
work
as
he
was
revolving
these
points
in
his
mind
miss
stanbury
entered
the
room
it
all
over
now
she
said
as
how
miss
stanbury
as
how
she
given
you
an
answer
has
she
yes
miss
stanbury
she
has
given
me
an
answer
but
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
young
ladies
are
sometimes
perhaps
a
little
she
means
it
gibson
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
she
is
quite
in
earnest
she
can
take
the
bit
between
her
teeth
as
well
as
another
though
she
does
look
so
mild
and
gentle
she
a
stanbury
all
over
and
must
this
be
the
last
of
it
miss
stanbury
upon
my
word
i
do
know
what
else
you
can
do
unless
you
send
the
dean
and
chapter
to
talk
her
over
she
a
foolish
young
woman
but
i
ca
help
that
the
truth
is
you
did
make
enough
of
her
at
first
gibson
you
thought
the
plum
would
tumble
into
your
mouth
this
did
seem
cruel
to
the
poor
man
from
the
first
day
in
which
the
project
had
been
opened
to
him
by
miss
stanbury
he
had
yielded
a
ready
acquiescence
in
spite
of
those
ties
which
he
had
at
heavitree
and
had
done
his
very
best
to
fall
into
her
views
i
do
think
that
is
at
all
fair
miss
stanbury
he
said
with
some
tone
of
wrath
in
his
voice
it
true
quite
true
you
always
treated
her
as
though
she
were
something
beneath
you
gibson
stood
speechless
with
his
mouth
open
so
you
did
i
saw
it
all
and
now
she
had
spirit
enough
to
resent
it
i
do
wonder
at
it
i
do
indeed
it
no
good
your
standing
there
any
longer
the
thing
is
done
such
intolerable
gibson
had
never
suffered
in
his
life
had
he
been
untrue
or
very
nearly
untrue
to
those
dear
girls
at
heavitree
for
this
i
never
treated
her
as
anything
beneath
me
he
said
at
last
yes
you
did
do
you
think
that
i
do
understand
have
i
eyes
in
my
head
and
ears
i
not
deaf
yet
nor
blind
but
there
an
end
of
it
if
any
young
woman
ever
meant
anything
she
means
it
the
truth
is
she
do
like
you
was
ever
a
lover
despatched
in
so
uncourteous
a
way
then
too
he
had
been
summoned
thither
as
a
lover
had
been
specially
encouraged
to
come
there
as
a
lover
had
been
assured
of
success
in
a
peculiar
way
had
had
the
plum
actually
offered
to
him
he
had
done
all
that
this
old
woman
had
bidden
him
something
indeed
to
the
prejudice
of
his
own
heart
he
had
been
told
that
the
wife
was
ready
for
him
and
now
because
this
foolish
young
woman
did
know
her
own
mind
this
was
gibson
view
of
the
matter
he
was
reviled
and
abused
and
told
that
he
had
behaved
badly
to
the
lady
miss
stanbury
he
said
i
think
that
you
are
forgetting
yourself
highty
tighty
said
miss
stanbury
forgetting
myself
i
forget
you
in
a
hurry
mr
gibson
nor
i
you
miss
stanbury
good
morning
miss
stanbury
gibson
as
he
went
from
the
into
the
street
shook
the
dust
off
his
feet
and
resolved
that
for
the
future
he
and
miss
stanbury
should
be
two
there
would
arise
great
trouble
in
exeter
but
nevertheless
he
and
miss
stanbury
must
be
two
he
could
justify
himself
in
no
other
purpose
after
such
conduct
as
he
had
received
chapter
xliii
laburnum
cottage
there
had
been
various
letters
passing
during
the
last
six
weeks
between
priscilla
stanbury
and
her
brother
respecting
the
clock
house
at
nuncombe
putney
the
ladies
at
nuncombe
had
certainly
gone
into
the
clock
house
on
the
clear
understanding
that
the
expenses
of
the
establishment
were
to
be
incurred
on
behalf
of
trevelyan
priscilla
had
assented
to
the
movement
most
doubtingly
she
had
disliked
the
idea
of
taking
the
charge
of
a
young
married
woman
who
was
separated
from
her
husband
and
she
had
felt
that
a
going
down
after
such
an
uprising
a
fall
from
the
clock
house
back
to
a
cottage
would
be
very
disagreeable
she
had
however
allowed
her
brother
arguments
to
prevail
and
there
they
were
the
annoyance
which
she
had
anticipated
from
the
position
of
their
late
guest
had
fallen
upon
them
it
had
been
felt
grievously
from
the
moment
in
which
colonel
osborne
called
at
the
house
and
now
that
going
back
to
the
cottage
must
be
endured
priscilla
understood
that
there
had
been
a
settlement
between
trevelyan
and
stanbury
as
to
the
cost
of
the
establishment
so
far
but
that
must
now
be
at
an
end
in
their
present
circumstances
she
would
not
continue
to
live
there
and
had
already
made
inquiries
as
to
some
humble
roof
for
their
shelter
for
herself
she
would
not
have
cared
had
it
been
necessary
for
her
to
hide
herself
in
a
hut
for
herself
as
regarded
any
feeling
as
to
her
own
standing
in
the
village
for
herself
she
was
ashamed
of
nothing
but
her
mother
would
suffer
and
she
knew
what
aunt
stanbury
would
say
to
dorothy
to
dorothy
at
the
present
moment
if
dorothy
should
think
of
accepting
her
suitor
the
change
might
be
very
deleterious
but
still
it
should
be
made
she
could
not
endure
to
live
there
on
the
very
proceeds
of
her
pen
proceeds
which
were
not
only
but
precarious
she
gave
warning
to
the
two
servants
who
had
been
hired
and
consulted
with
crocket
as
to
a
cottage
and
was
careful
to
let
it
be
known
throughout
nuncombe
putney
that
the
clock
house
was
to
be
abandoned
the
clock
house
had
been
taken
furnished
for
six
months
of
which
half
were
not
yet
over
but
there
were
other
expenses
of
living
there
much
greater
than
the
rent
and
go
she
would
her
mother
sighed
and
assented
and
crocket
having
strongly
but
fruitlessly
advised
that
the
clock
house
should
be
inhabited
at
any
rate
for
the
six
months
promised
her
assistance
it
has
been
a
bad
business
crocket
said
priscilla
and
all
we
can
do
now
is
to
get
out
of
it
as
well
as
we
can
every
mouthful
i
eat
chokes
me
while
i
stay
there
it
ai
good
certainly
miss
not
to
know
as
you
all
straight
the
first
thing
as
you
wakes
in
the
morning
said
crocket
who
was
always
able
to
feel
when
she
woke
that
everything
was
straight
with
her
then
there
came
the
correspondence
between
priscilla
and
hugh
priscilla
was
at
first
decided
indeed
but
mild
in
the
expression
of
her
decision
to
this
and
to
one
or
two
other
missives
couched
in
terms
of
increasing
decision
hugh
answered
with
manly
overbearing
arguments
the
house
was
theirs
till
christmas
between
this
and
then
he
would
think
about
it
he
could
very
well
afford
to
keep
the
house
on
till
next
midsummer
and
then
they
might
see
what
had
best
be
done
there
was
plenty
of
money
and
priscilla
need
not
put
herself
into
a
flutter
in
answer
to
that
word
flutter
priscilla
wrote
as
follows
clock
house
september
dear
hugh
i
know
very
well
how
good
you
are
and
how
generous
but
you
must
allow
me
to
have
feelings
as
well
as
yourself
i
will
not
consent
to
have
myself
regarded
as
a
grand
lady
out
of
your
earnings
how
should
i
feel
when
some
day
i
heard
that
you
had
run
yourself
into
debt
neither
mamma
nor
i
could
endure
it
dorothy
is
provided
for
now
at
any
rate
for
a
time
and
what
we
have
is
enough
for
us
you
know
i
am
not
too
proud
to
take
anything
you
can
spare
to
us
when
we
are
ourselves
placed
in
a
proper
position
but
i
could
not
live
in
this
great
house
while
you
are
paying
for
everything
and
i
will
not
mamma
quite
agrees
with
me
and
we
shall
go
out
of
it
on
crocket
says
she
thinks
she
can
get
you
a
tenant
for
the
three
months
out
of
exeter
if
not
for
the
whole
rent
at
least
for
part
of
it
i
think
we
have
already
got
a
small
place
for
eight
shillings
a
week
a
little
out
of
the
village
on
the
road
to
cockchaffington
you
will
remember
it
old
soames
used
to
live
there
our
old
furniture
will
be
just
enough
there
is
a
mite
of
a
garden
and
crocket
says
she
thinks
we
can
get
it
for
seven
shillings
or
perhaps
for
six
and
sixpence
if
we
stay
there
we
shall
go
in
on
the
crocket
will
see
about
having
somebody
to
take
care
of
the
house
your
most
affectionate
sister
priscilla
on
the
receipt
of
this
letter
hugh
proceeded
to
nuncombe
at
this
time
he
was
making
about
ten
guineas
a
week
and
thought
that
he
saw
his
way
to
further
work
no
doubt
the
ten
guineas
were
precarious
that
is
the
daily
record
might
discontinue
his
services
if
the
daily
record
thought
fit
to
do
so
the
greater
part
of
his
earnings
came
from
the
and
the
editor
had
only
to
say
that
things
did
not
suit
any
longer
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
he
was
not
as
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
with
many
clients
who
could
not
all
be
supposed
to
withdraw
their
custom
at
once
but
leading
articles
were
things
wanted
with
at
least
as
much
regularity
as
physic
or
law
and
hugh
stanbury
believing
in
himself
did
not
think
it
probable
that
an
editor
who
knew
what
he
was
about
would
withdraw
his
patronage
he
was
proud
of
his
weekly
ten
guineas
feeling
sure
that
a
weekly
ten
guineas
would
not
as
yet
have
been
his
had
he
stuck
to
the
bar
as
a
profession
he
had
calculated
when
trevelyan
left
the
clock
house
that
two
hundred
a
year
would
enable
his
mother
to
continue
to
reside
there
the
rent
of
the
place
furnished
or
being
only
eighty
and
he
thought
that
he
could
pay
the
two
hundred
easily
he
thought
so
still
when
he
received
priscilla
last
letter
but
he
knew
something
of
the
stubbornness
of
his
dear
sister
and
he
therefore
went
down
to
nuncombe
putney
in
order
that
he
might
use
the
violence
of
his
logic
on
his
mother
he
had
heard
of
gibson
from
both
priscilla
and
from
dorothy
and
was
certainly
desirous
that
dear
old
dolly
as
he
called
her
should
be
settled
comfortably
but
when
dear
old
dolly
wrote
to
him
declaring
that
it
could
not
be
so
that
gibson
was
a
very
nice
gentleman
of
whom
she
could
not
say
that
she
was
particularly
fond
though
i
really
do
think
that
he
is
an
excellent
man
and
if
it
was
any
other
girl
in
the
world
i
should
recommend
her
to
take
him
and
that
she
thought
that
she
would
rather
not
get
married
he
wrote
to
her
the
kindest
brotherly
letter
in
the
world
telling
her
that
she
was
a
brick
and
suggesting
to
her
that
there
might
come
some
day
some
one
who
would
suit
her
taste
better
than
gibson
i
not
very
fond
of
parsons
myself
said
hugh
but
you
must
not
tell
that
to
aunt
stanbury
then
he
suggested
that
as
he
was
going
down
to
nuncombe
dorothy
should
get
leave
of
absence
and
come
over
and
meet
him
at
the
clock
house
dorothy
demanded
the
leave
of
absence
somewhat
imperiously
and
was
at
home
at
the
clock
house
when
hugh
arrived
and
so
that
little
affair
could
come
off
said
hugh
at
their
first
family
meeting
it
was
a
pity
said
stanbury
plaintively
she
had
been
very
plaintive
on
the
subject
what
a
thing
it
would
have
been
for
her
could
she
have
seen
dorothy
so
well
established
there
no
help
for
spilt
milk
mother
said
hugh
stanbury
shook
her
head
dorothy
was
quite
right
said
priscilla
of
course
she
was
right
said
hugh
who
doubts
her
being
right
bless
my
soul
what
any
girl
to
do
if
she
do
like
a
man
except
to
tell
him
so
i
honour
you
dolly
not
that
i
ever
should
have
doubted
you
you
too
much
of
a
chip
of
the
old
block
to
say
you
liked
a
man
when
you
did
he
is
a
very
excellent
young
man
said
stanbury
an
excellent
fiddlestick
mother
loving
and
liking
do
go
by
excellence
besides
i
do
know
about
his
being
any
better
than
anybody
else
just
because
he
a
clergyman
a
clergyman
is
more
likely
to
be
steady
than
other
men
said
the
mother
steady
yes
and
as
selfish
as
you
please
your
father
was
a
clergyman
hugh
i
do
mean
to
say
that
they
are
not
as
good
as
others
but
i
have
it
that
they
are
better
they
are
always
dealing
with
the
bible
till
they
think
themselves
apostles
but
when
money
comes
up
or
comfort
or
for
the
matter
of
that
either
a
pretty
woman
with
a
little
money
then
they
are
as
human
as
the
rest
of
us
if
the
truth
had
been
told
on
that
occasion
hugh
stanbury
would
have
had
to
own
that
he
had
written
lately
two
or
three
rather
stinging
articles
in
the
daily
record
as
to
the
assumed
merits
and
actual
demerits
of
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
it
is
astonishing
how
fluent
a
man
is
on
a
subject
when
he
has
lately
delivered
himself
respecting
it
in
this
fashion
nothing
on
that
evening
was
said
about
the
clock
house
or
about
priscilla
intentions
priscilla
was
up
early
on
the
next
morning
intending
to
discuss
it
in
the
garden
with
hugh
before
breakfast
but
hugh
was
aware
of
her
purpose
and
avoided
her
it
was
his
intention
to
speak
first
to
his
mother
and
though
his
mother
was
as
he
knew
very
much
in
awe
of
her
daughter
he
thought
that
he
might
carry
his
point
at
any
rate
for
the
next
three
months
by
forcing
an
assent
from
the
elder
lady
so
he
managed
to
waylay
stanbury
before
she
descended
to
the
parlour
we
ca
afford
it
my
dear
indeed
we
ca
said
stanbury
that
not
the
question
mother
the
rent
must
be
paid
up
to
christmas
and
you
can
live
here
as
cheap
as
you
can
anywhere
but
priscilla
oh
priscilla
of
course
we
know
what
priscilla
says
priscilla
has
been
writing
to
me
about
it
in
the
most
sensible
manner
in
the
world
but
what
does
it
all
come
to
if
you
are
ashamed
of
taking
assistance
from
me
i
do
know
who
is
to
do
anything
for
anybody
you
are
comfortable
here
very
comfortable
only
priscilla
feels
priscilla
is
a
tyrant
mother
and
a
very
stern
one
just
make
up
your
mind
to
stay
here
till
christmas
if
i
tell
you
that
i
can
afford
it
surely
that
ought
to
be
enough
then
dorothy
entered
the
room
and
hugh
appealed
to
her
dorothy
had
come
to
nuncombe
only
on
the
day
before
and
had
not
been
consulted
on
the
subject
she
had
been
told
that
the
clock
house
was
to
be
abandoned
and
had
been
taken
down
to
inspect
the
cottage
in
which
old
soames
had
lived
but
her
opinion
had
not
been
asked
priscilla
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
and
why
should
she
ask
an
opinion
of
any
one
but
now
opinion
was
demanded
it
what
i
call
the
rhodomontade
of
independence
said
hugh
i
suppose
it
is
very
expensive
suggested
dorothy
the
house
must
be
paid
for
said
hugh
and
if
i
say
that
i
got
the
money
is
not
that
enough
a
miserable
dirty
little
place
where
you
catch
your
death
of
lumbago
mother
of
course
it
not
a
comfortable
house
said
stanbury
who
of
herself
was
not
at
all
indifferent
to
the
comforts
of
her
present
residence
and
it
is
very
dirty
said
dorothy
the
nastiest
place
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
come
mother
if
i
say
that
i
can
afford
it
ought
not
that
to
be
enough
for
you
if
you
think
you
ca
trust
me
there
an
end
of
everything
you
know
and
hugh
as
he
thus
expressed
himself
assumed
an
air
of
injured
virtue
stanbury
had
very
nearly
yielded
when
priscilla
came
in
among
them
it
was
impossible
not
to
continue
the
conversation
though
hugh
would
much
have
preferred
to
have
forced
an
assent
from
his
mother
before
he
opened
his
mouth
on
the
subject
to
his
sister
my
mother
agrees
with
me
said
he
abruptly
and
so
does
dolly
that
it
will
be
absurd
to
move
away
from
this
house
at
present
mamma
exclaimed
priscilla
i
do
think
i
said
that
hugh
murmured
dorothy
softly
i
sure
i
do
want
anything
for
myself
said
stanbury
it
i
that
want
it
said
hugh
and
i
think
that
i
a
right
to
have
my
wishes
respected
so
far
as
that
goes
my
dear
hugh
said
priscilla
the
cottage
is
already
taken
and
we
shall
certainly
go
into
it
i
spoke
to
crocket
yesterday
about
a
cart
for
moving
the
things
i
sure
mamma
agrees
with
me
what
possible
business
can
people
have
to
live
in
such
a
house
as
this
with
about
shillings
a
week
for
everything
i
wo
do
it
and
as
the
thing
is
settled
it
is
only
making
trouble
to
disturb
it
i
suppose
priscilla
said
hugh
you
do
as
your
mother
chooses
mamma
chooses
to
go
she
has
told
me
so
already
you
have
talked
her
into
it
we
had
better
go
hugh
said
stanbury
i
sure
we
had
better
go
of
course
we
shall
go
said
priscilla
hugh
is
very
kind
and
very
generous
but
he
is
only
giving
trouble
for
nothing
about
this
had
we
not
better
go
down
to
breakfast
and
so
priscilla
carried
the
day
they
went
down
to
breakfast
and
during
the
meal
hugh
would
speak
to
nobody
when
the
gloomy
meal
was
over
he
took
his
pipe
and
walked
out
to
the
cottage
it
was
an
rickety
place
small
and
desolate
with
a
pretension
about
it
of
the
lowest
order
a
pretension
that
was
evidently
ashamed
of
itself
there
was
a
porch
and
the
one
had
what
the
late
soames
had
always
called
his
bow
window
but
the
porch
looked
as
though
it
were
tumbling
down
and
the
bow
window
looked
as
though
it
were
tumbling
out
the
parlour
and
the
bedroom
over
it
had
been
papered
but
the
paper
was
torn
and
soiled
and
in
sundry
places
was
hanging
loose
there
was
a
miserable
little
room
called
a
kitchen
to
the
right
as
you
entered
the
door
in
which
the
grate
was
worn
out
and
behind
this
was
a
shed
with
a
copper
in
the
garden
there
remained
the
stumps
and
stalks
of
soames
cabbages
and
there
were
weeds
in
plenty
and
a
damp
hole
among
some
elder
bushes
called
an
arbour
it
was
named
laburnum
cottage
from
a
shrub
that
grew
at
the
end
of
the
house
hugh
stanbury
shuddered
as
he
stood
smoking
among
the
how
could
a
man
ask
such
a
girl
as
nora
rowley
to
be
his
wife
whose
mother
lived
in
a
place
like
this
while
he
was
still
standing
in
the
garden
and
thinking
of
priscilla
obstinacy
and
his
own
ten
guineas
a
week
and
the
sort
of
life
which
he
lived
in
london
where
he
dined
usually
at
his
club
and
denied
himself
nothing
in
the
way
of
pipes
beer
and
beefsteaks
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
and
turning
round
saw
his
elder
sister
hugh
she
said
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
but
i
am
angry
with
you
i
know
you
are
but
you
are
unjust
i
am
doing
what
i
am
sure
is
right
i
never
saw
such
a
beastly
hole
as
this
in
all
my
life
i
do
think
it
beastly
at
all
you
find
that
i
make
it
nice
whatever
we
want
here
you
shall
give
us
you
are
not
to
think
that
i
am
too
proud
to
take
anything
at
your
hands
it
is
not
that
it
very
like
it
i
have
never
refused
anything
that
is
reasonable
but
it
is
quite
unreasonable
that
we
should
go
on
living
in
such
a
place
as
that
as
though
we
had
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
of
our
own
if
mamma
got
used
to
the
comfort
of
it
it
would
be
hard
then
upon
her
to
move
you
shall
give
her
what
you
can
afford
and
what
is
reasonable
but
it
is
madness
to
think
of
living
there
i
could
do
it
you
to
have
your
way
at
any
rate
it
seems
but
you
must
not
quarrel
with
me
hugh
give
me
a
kiss
i
do
have
you
often
with
me
and
yet
you
are
the
only
man
in
the
world
that
i
ever
speak
to
or
even
know
i
sometimes
half
think
that
the
bread
is
so
hard
and
the
water
so
bitter
that
life
will
become
impossible
i
try
to
get
over
it
but
if
you
were
to
go
away
from
me
in
anger
i
should
be
so
beaten
for
a
week
or
two
that
i
could
do
nothing
why
wo
you
let
me
do
anything
i
will
whatever
you
please
but
kiss
me
then
he
kissed
her
as
he
stood
among
soames
dear
hugh
you
are
such
a
god
to
me
you
do
treat
me
like
a
divinity
but
i
think
of
you
as
one
when
you
are
absent
the
gods
were
never
obeyed
when
they
showed
themselves
let
us
go
and
have
a
walk
come
shall
we
get
as
far
as
ridleigh
mill
then
they
started
together
and
all
unpleasantness
was
over
between
them
when
they
returned

brooke
burgess
takes
leave
of
exeter
illustration
the
time
had
arrived
at
which
brooke
burgess
was
to
leave
exeter
he
had
made
his
tour
through
the
county
and
returned
to
spend
his
two
last
nights
at
miss
stanbury
house
when
he
came
back
dorothy
was
still
at
nuncombe
but
she
arrived
in
the
close
the
day
before
his
departure
her
mother
and
sister
had
wished
her
to
stay
at
nuncombe
there
is
a
bed
for
you
now
and
a
place
to
be
comfortable
in
priscilla
had
said
laughing
and
you
may
as
well
see
the
last
of
us
but
dorothy
declared
that
she
had
named
a
day
to
her
aunt
and
that
she
would
not
break
her
engagement
i
suppose
you
can
stay
if
you
like
priscilla
had
urged
but
dorothy
was
of
opinion
that
she
ought
not
to
stay
she
said
not
a
word
about
brooke
burgess
but
it
may
be
that
it
would
have
been
matter
of
regret
to
her
not
to
shake
hands
with
him
once
more
brooke
declared
to
her
that
had
she
not
come
back
he
would
have
gone
over
to
nuncombe
to
see
her
but
dorothy
did
not
consider
herself
entitled
to
believe
that
on
the
morning
of
the
last
day
brooke
went
over
to
his
office
i
come
to
say
uncle
barty
he
said
my
boy
take
care
of
yourself
i
mean
to
try
you
have
quarrelled
with
the
old
woman
have
you
said
uncle
barty
not
yet
that
is
to
say
not
to
the
knife
and
you
still
believe
that
you
are
to
have
her
money
i
believe
nothing
one
way
or
the
other
you
may
be
sure
of
this
i
shall
never
count
it
mine
till
i
got
it
and
i
shall
never
make
myself
so
sure
of
it
as
to
break
my
heart
because
i
do
get
it
i
suppose
i
got
as
good
a
right
to
it
as
anybody
else
and
i
see
why
i
should
take
it
if
it
come
in
my
way
i
do
think
it
ever
will
said
the
old
man
after
a
pause
i
shall
be
none
the
worse
said
brooke
yes
you
will
you
be
a
man
and
she
means
to
break
your
heart
she
does
it
on
purpose
she
has
no
more
idea
of
leaving
you
her
money
than
i
have
why
should
she
simply
because
she
takes
the
fancy
fancy
believe
me
there
is
very
little
fancy
about
it
there
one
of
the
name
she
would
ruin
if
she
could
she
break
all
our
hearts
if
she
could
get
at
them
look
at
me
and
my
position
little
more
than
a
clerk
in
the
concern
by
god
i
not
so
well
off
as
a
senior
clerk
in
many
a
bank
if
there
came
a
bad
time
i
must
lose
as
the
others
would
lose
but
a
clerk
never
loses
and
my
share
in
the
business
is
almost
a
nothing
it
just
nothing
compared
to
what
it
would
have
been
only
for
her
brooke
had
known
that
his
uncle
was
a
disappointed
or
at
least
a
discontented
man
but
he
had
never
known
much
of
the
old
circumstances
and
certainly
had
not
expected
to
hear
him
speak
in
the
strain
that
he
had
now
used
he
had
heard
often
that
his
uncle
barty
disliked
miss
stanbury
and
had
not
been
surprised
at
former
sharp
biting
little
words
spoken
in
reference
to
that
character
but
he
had
not
expected
such
a
tirade
of
abuse
as
the
banker
had
now
poured
out
of
course
i
know
nothing
about
the
bank
said
he
but
i
did
not
suppose
that
she
had
had
anything
to
do
with
it
where
do
you
think
the
money
came
from
that
she
has
got
did
you
ever
hear
that
she
had
anything
of
her
own
she
never
had
a
penny
never
a
penny
it
came
out
of
this
house
it
is
the
capital
on
which
this
business
was
founded
and
on
which
it
ought
to
be
carried
on
to
this
day
my
brother
had
thrown
her
off
by
heavens
yes
had
thrown
her
off
he
had
found
out
what
she
was
and
had
got
rid
of
her
but
he
left
her
his
money
yes
she
got
near
him
when
he
was
dying
and
he
did
leave
her
his
money
his
money
and
my
money
and
your
father
money
he
could
have
given
her
nothing
uncle
barty
that
was
his
own
of
course
that
true
it
true
in
one
way
you
might
say
the
same
of
a
man
who
was
cozened
into
leaving
every
shilling
away
from
his
own
children
i
was
in
exeter
when
the
will
was
made
we
none
of
us
were
here
but
she
was
here
and
when
we
came
to
see
him
die
there
we
found
her
she
had
had
her
revenge
upon
him
and
she
means
to
have
it
on
all
of
us
i
do
believe
she
ever
leave
you
a
shilling
brooke
you
find
her
out
yet
and
you
talk
of
her
to
your
nephews
as
i
do
to
you
brooke
made
some
ordinary
answer
to
this
and
bade
his
uncle
adieu
he
had
allowed
himself
to
entertain
a
half
chivalrous
idea
that
he
could
produce
a
reconciliation
between
miss
stanbury
and
his
uncle
barty
and
since
he
had
been
at
exeter
he
had
said
a
word
first
to
the
one
and
then
to
the
other
hinting
at
the
subject
but
his
hints
had
certainly
not
been
successful
as
he
walked
from
the
bank
into
the
high
street
he
could
not
fail
to
ask
himself
whether
there
were
any
grounds
for
the
terrible
accusations
which
he
had
just
heard
from
his
uncle
lips
something
of
the
same
kind
though
in
form
much
less
violent
had
been
repeated
to
him
very
often
by
others
of
the
family
though
he
had
as
a
boy
known
miss
stanbury
well
he
had
been
taught
to
regard
her
as
an
ogress
all
the
burgesses
had
regarded
miss
stanbury
as
an
ogress
since
that
unfortunate
will
had
come
to
light
but
she
was
an
ogress
from
whom
something
might
be
gained
and
the
ogress
had
still
persisted
in
saying
that
a
burgess
should
be
her
heir
it
had
therefore
come
to
pass
that
brooke
had
been
brought
up
half
to
revere
her
and
half
to
abhor
her
she
is
a
dreadful
woman
said
his
branch
of
the
family
who
will
not
scruple
at
anything
evil
but
as
it
seems
that
you
may
probably
reap
the
advantage
of
the
evil
that
she
does
it
will
become
you
to
put
up
with
her
iniquity
as
he
had
become
old
enough
to
understand
the
nature
of
her
position
he
had
determined
to
judge
for
himself
but
his
judgment
hitherto
simply
amounted
to
this
that
miss
stanbury
was
a
very
singular
old
woman
with
a
kind
heart
and
good
instincts
but
so
capricious
withal
that
no
sensible
man
would
risk
his
happiness
on
expectations
formed
on
her
promises
guided
by
this
opinion
he
had
resolved
to
be
attentive
to
her
and
after
a
certain
fashion
submissive
but
certainly
not
to
become
her
slave
she
had
thrown
over
her
nephew
she
was
constantly
complaining
to
him
of
her
niece
now
and
again
she
would
say
a
very
bitter
word
to
him
about
himself
when
he
had
left
exeter
on
his
little
excursion
no
one
was
so
much
in
favour
with
her
as
gibson
on
his
return
he
found
that
gibson
had
been
altogether
discarded
and
was
spoken
of
in
terms
of
almost
insolent
abuse
if
i
were
ever
so
humble
to
her
he
had
said
to
himself
it
would
do
no
good
and
there
is
nothing
i
hate
so
much
as
humility
he
had
thus
determined
to
take
the
goods
the
gods
provided
should
it
ever
come
to
pass
that
such
godlike
provision
was
laid
before
him
out
of
miss
stanbury
coffers
but
not
to
alter
his
mode
of
life
or
put
himself
out
of
his
way
in
obedience
to
her
behests
as
a
man
might
be
expected
to
do
who
was
destined
to
receive
so
rich
a
legacy
upon
this
idea
he
had
acted
still
believing
the
old
woman
to
be
good
but
believing
at
the
same
time
that
she
was
very
capricious
now
he
had
heard
what
his
uncle
bartholomew
burgess
had
had
to
say
upon
the
matter
and
he
could
not
refrain
from
asking
himself
whether
his
uncle
accusations
were
true
in
a
narrow
passage
between
the
high
street
and
the
close
he
met
gibson
there
had
come
to
be
that
sort
of
intimacy
between
the
two
men
which
grows
from
closeness
of
position
rather
than
from
any
social
desire
on
either
side
and
it
was
natural
that
burgess
should
say
a
word
of
farewell
on
the
previous
evening
miss
stanbury
had
relieved
her
mind
by
turning
gibson
into
ridicule
in
her
description
to
brooke
of
the
manner
in
which
the
clergyman
had
carried
on
his
love
affair
and
she
had
at
the
same
time
declared
that
gibson
had
been
most
violently
impertinent
to
herself
he
knew
therefore
that
miss
stanbury
and
gibson
had
become
two
and
would
on
this
occasion
have
passed
on
without
a
word
relative
to
the
old
lady
had
gibson
allowed
him
to
do
so
but
gibson
spoke
his
mind
freely
off
are
you
he
said
i
hope
we
may
meet
again
but
not
in
the
same
house
mr
burgess
there
or
anywhere
i
shall
be
very
happy
said
brooke
not
there
certainly
while
you
were
absent
miss
stanbury
treated
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
shall
certainly
never
put
my
foot
in
her
house
again
dear
me
i
thought
that
you
and
she
were
such
great
friends
i
knew
her
very
well
of
course
and
respected
her
she
is
a
good
churchwoman
and
is
charitable
in
the
city
but
she
has
got
such
a
tongue
in
her
head
that
there
is
no
bearing
it
when
she
does
what
she
calls
giving
you
a
bit
of
her
mind
she
has
been
indulgent
to
me
and
has
not
given
me
much
of
it
your
time
will
come
i
no
doubt
continued
gibson
everybody
has
always
told
me
that
it
would
be
so
even
her
oldest
friends
knew
it
you
ask
machugh
or
french
at
heavitree
mrs
french
said
brooke
laughing
that
would
hardly
be
fair
evidence
why
not
i
do
know
a
better
judge
of
character
in
all
exeter
than
french
and
she
and
miss
stanbury
have
been
intimate
all
their
lives
ask
your
uncle
at
the
bank
my
uncle
and
miss
stanbury
never
were
friends
said
brooke
ask
hugh
stanbury
what
he
thinks
of
her
but
do
suppose
i
want
to
say
a
word
against
her
i
would
for
the
world
do
such
a
thing
only
as
we
met
there
and
all
that
i
thought
it
best
to
let
you
know
that
she
had
treated
me
in
such
a
way
and
has
been
altogether
so
violent
that
i
never
will
go
there
again
so
saying
gibson
passed
on
and
was
of
opinion
that
he
had
spoken
with
great
generosity
of
the
old
woman
who
had
treated
him
so
badly
in
the
afternoon
brooke
burgess
went
over
to
the
further
end
of
the
close
and
called
on
machugh
and
from
thence
he
walked
across
to
heavitree
and
called
on
the
frenches
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
would
have
been
so
well
behaved
to
these
ladies
had
they
not
been
appealed
to
by
gibson
as
witnesses
to
the
character
of
miss
stanbury
he
got
very
little
from
machugh
that
lady
was
kind
and
cordial
and
expressed
many
wishes
that
she
might
see
him
again
in
exeter
when
he
said
a
few
words
about
gibson
machugh
only
laughed
and
declared
that
the
gentleman
would
soon
find
a
plaister
for
that
sore
there
are
more
fishes
than
one
in
the
sea
she
said
but
i
afraid
they
quarrelled
mrs
machugh
so
they
tell
me
what
should
we
have
to
talk
about
here
if
somebody
did
quarrel
sometimes
she
and
i
ought
to
get
up
a
quarrel
for
the
good
of
the
public
only
they
know
that
i
never
can
quarrel
with
anybody
i
never
see
anybody
interesting
enough
to
quarrel
with
but
machugh
said
nothing
about
miss
stanbury
except
that
she
sent
over
a
message
with
reference
to
a
rubber
of
whist
for
the
next
night
but
one
he
found
the
two
french
girls
sitting
with
their
mother
and
they
all
expressed
their
great
gratitude
to
him
for
coming
to
say
before
he
went
it
so
very
nice
of
you
burgess
said
camilla
and
particularly
just
at
present
yes
indeed
said
arabella
because
you
know
things
have
been
so
unpleasant
my
dears
never
mind
about
that
said
french
miss
stanbury
has
meant
everything
for
the
best
and
it
is
all
over
now
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
its
being
all
over
mamma
said
camilla
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it
has
never
been
begun
my
dear
the
least
said
the
soonest
mended
said
french
that
of
course
mamma
said
camilla
but
yet
one
ca
hold
one
tongue
altogether
all
the
city
is
talking
about
it
and
i
dare
say
burgess
has
heard
as
much
as
anybody
else
i
heard
nothing
at
all
said
brooke
oh
yes
you
have
continued
camilla
arabella
conceived
herself
at
this
moment
to
be
situated
in
so
delicate
a
position
that
it
was
best
that
her
sister
should
talk
about
it
and
that
she
herself
should
hold
her
tongue
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
a
hint
here
and
there
which
might
be
of
assistance
for
arabella
completely
understood
that
the
prize
was
now
to
be
hers
if
the
prize
could
be
rescued
out
of
the
stanbury
clutches
she
was
aware
no
one
better
aware
how
her
sister
had
interfered
with
her
early
hopes
and
was
sure
in
her
own
mind
that
all
her
disappointment
had
come
from
fratricidal
rivalry
on
the
part
of
camilla
it
had
never
however
been
open
to
her
to
quarrel
with
camilla
there
they
were
linked
together
and
together
they
must
fight
their
battles
as
two
pigs
may
be
seen
at
the
same
trough
each
striving
to
take
the
delicacies
of
the
banquet
from
the
other
and
yet
enjoying
always
the
warmth
of
the
same
dunghill
in
amicable
contiguity
so
had
these
young
ladies
lived
in
sisterly
friendship
while
each
was
striving
to
take
a
husband
from
the
other
they
had
understood
the
position
and
though
for
years
back
they
had
talked
about
gibson
they
had
never
quarrelled
but
now
in
these
latter
days
of
the
stanbury
interference
there
had
come
tacitly
to
be
something
of
an
understanding
between
them
that
if
any
fighting
were
still
possible
on
the
subject
one
must
be
put
forward
and
the
other
must
yield
there
had
been
no
spoken
agreement
but
arabella
quite
understood
that
she
was
to
be
put
forward
it
was
for
her
to
take
up
the
running
and
to
win
if
possible
against
the
stanbury
filly
that
was
her
view
and
she
was
inclined
to
give
camilla
credit
for
acting
in
accordance
with
it
with
honesty
and
zeal
she
felt
therefore
that
her
words
on
the
present
occasion
ought
to
be
few
she
sat
back
in
her
corner
of
the
sofa
and
was
intent
on
her
work
and
shewed
by
the
pensiveness
of
her
brow
that
there
were
thoughts
within
her
bosom
of
which
she
was
not
disposed
to
speak
you
must
have
heard
a
great
deal
said
camilla
laughing
you
must
know
how
poor
gibson
has
been
abused
because
he
would
camilla
do
be
foolish
said
french
because
he
would
what
asked
brooke
what
ought
he
to
have
done
that
he
did
do
i
do
know
anything
about
ought
said
camilla
that
a
matter
of
taste
altogether
i
the
worst
hand
in
the
world
at
a
riddle
said
brooke
how
sly
you
are
continued
camilla
laughing
as
if
dear
aunt
stanbury
had
confided
all
her
hopes
to
you
camilla
dear
do
said
arabella
but
when
a
gentleman
is
hunted
and
ca
be
caught
i
do
think
he
ought
to
be
abused
to
his
face
but
who
hunted
him
and
who
abused
him
asked
brooke
mind
i
do
mean
to
say
a
word
against
miss
stanbury
burgess
we
known
her
and
loved
her
all
our
lives
have
we
mamma
and
respected
her
said
arabella
quite
so
continued
camilla
but
you
know
burgess
that
she
likes
her
own
way
i
do
know
anybody
that
does
not
said
brooke
and
when
she
disappointed
she
shows
it
there
no
doubt
she
is
disappointed
now
mr
burgess
what
the
good
of
going
on
camilla
said
french
arabella
sat
silent
in
her
corner
with
a
conscious
glow
of
satisfaction
as
she
reflected
that
the
joint
disappointment
of
the
elder
and
the
younger
miss
stanbury
had
been
caused
by
a
tender
remembrance
of
her
own
charms
had
not
dear
gibson
told
her
in
the
glowing
language
of
truth
that
there
was
nothing
further
from
his
thoughts
than
the
idea
of
taking
dorothy
stanbury
for
his
wife
well
you
know
continued
camilla
i
think
that
when
a
person
makes
an
attempt
and
comes
by
the
worst
of
it
that
person
should
put
up
with
the
defeat
and
not
say
all
manner
of
things
everybody
knows
that
a
certain
gentleman
is
very
intimate
in
this
house
do
dear
said
arabella
in
a
whisper
yes
i
shall
said
camilla
i
do
know
why
people
should
hold
their
tongues
when
other
people
talk
so
loudly
i
do
care
a
bit
what
anybody
says
about
the
gentleman
and
us
we
have
known
him
for
ever
so
many
years
and
mamma
is
very
fond
of
him
indeed
i
am
camilla
said
french
and
for
the
matter
of
that
so
am
i
very
said
camilla
laughing
bravely
i
do
care
who
knows
it
do
be
so
silly
child
said
arabella
camilla
was
certainly
doing
her
best
and
arabella
was
grateful
we
do
care
what
people
may
say
continued
camilla
again
of
course
we
heard
as
everybody
else
heard
too
that
a
certain
gentleman
was
to
be
married
to
a
certain
lady
it
was
nothing
to
us
whether
he
was
married
or
not
nothing
at
all
said
arabella
we
never
spoke
ill
of
the
young
lady
we
did
not
interfere
if
the
gentleman
liked
the
young
lady
he
was
quite
at
liberty
to
marry
her
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
we
had
been
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
here
almost
as
a
brother
and
perhaps
we
might
feel
that
a
connection
with
that
particular
young
lady
would
take
him
from
us
but
we
never
hinted
so
much
even
as
that
to
him
or
to
anyone
else
why
should
we
it
was
nothing
to
us
now
it
turns
out
that
the
gentleman
never
meant
anything
of
the
kind
whereupon
he
is
pretty
nearly
kicked
out
of
the
house
and
all
manner
of
things
are
said
about
us
everywhere
by
this
time
camilla
had
become
quite
excited
and
was
speaking
with
much
animation
how
can
you
be
so
foolish
camilla
said
arabella
perhaps
i
am
foolish
said
camilla
to
care
what
anybody
says
what
can
it
all
be
to
mr
burgess
said
french
only
this
that
as
we
all
like
burgess
and
as
he
is
almost
one
of
the
family
in
the
close
i
think
he
ought
to
know
why
we
are
not
quite
so
cordial
as
we
used
to
be
now
that
the
matter
is
over
i
have
no
doubt
things
will
get
right
again
and
as
for
the
young
lady
sure
we
feel
for
her
we
think
it
was
the
aunt
who
was
indiscreet
and
then
she
has
such
a
tongue
said
arabella
our
friend
brooke
of
course
knew
the
whole
truth
knew
the
nature
of
gibson
failure
and
knew
also
how
dorothy
had
acted
in
the
affair
he
was
inclined
moreover
to
believe
that
the
ladies
who
were
now
talking
to
him
were
as
well
instructed
on
the
subject
as
was
he
himself
he
had
heard
too
of
the
ambition
of
the
two
young
ladies
now
before
him
and
believed
that
that
ambition
was
not
yet
dead
but
he
did
not
think
it
incumbent
on
him
to
fight
a
battle
even
on
behalf
of
dorothy
he
might
have
declared
that
dorothy
at
least
had
not
been
disappointed
but
he
thought
it
better
to
be
silent
about
dorothy
yes
he
said
miss
stanbury
has
a
tongue
but
i
think
it
speaks
as
much
good
as
it
does
evil
and
perhaps
that
is
a
great
deal
to
say
for
any
lady
tongue
we
never
speak
evil
of
anybody
said
camilla
never
it
is
a
rule
with
us
then
brooke
took
his
leave
and
the
three
ladies
were
cordial
and
almost
affectionate
in
their
farewell
greetings
brooke
was
to
start
on
the
following
morning
before
anybody
would
be
up
except
martha
and
miss
stanbury
was
very
melancholy
during
the
evening
we
shall
miss
him
very
much
shall
we
not
she
said
appealing
to
dorothy
i
am
sure
you
will
miss
him
very
much
said
dorothy
we
are
so
stupid
here
alone
said
miss
stanbury
when
they
had
drank
their
tea
she
sat
nearly
silent
for
half
an
hour
and
then
summoned
him
up
into
her
own
room
so
you
are
going
brooke
she
said
yes
i
must
go
now
they
would
dismiss
me
if
i
stayed
an
hour
longer
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
to
the
old
woman
and
you
must
let
me
hear
of
you
from
time
to
time
of
course
i
write
and
brooke
what
is
it
aunt
stanbury
do
you
want
any
money
brooke
no
none
thank
you
i
plenty
for
a
bachelor
when
you
think
of
marrying
brooke
mind
you
tell
me
i
be
sure
to
tell
you
but
i
ca
promise
yet
when
that
will
be
she
said
nothing
more
to
him
though
she
paused
once
more
as
though
she
were
going
to
speak
she
kissed
him
and
bade
him
saying
that
she
would
not
go
again
that
evening
he
was
to
tell
dorothy
to
go
to
bed
and
so
they
parted
but
dorothy
did
not
go
to
bed
for
an
hour
after
that
when
brooke
came
down
into
the
parlour
with
his
message
she
intended
to
go
at
once
and
put
up
her
work
and
lit
her
candle
and
put
out
her
hand
to
him
and
said
to
him
but
for
all
that
she
remained
there
for
an
hour
with
him
at
first
she
said
very
little
but
by
degrees
her
tongue
was
loosened
and
she
found
herself
talking
with
a
freedom
which
she
could
hardly
herself
understand
she
told
him
how
thoroughly
she
believed
her
aunt
to
be
a
good
woman
how
sure
she
was
that
her
aunt
was
at
any
rate
honest
as
for
me
said
dorothy
i
know
that
i
have
displeased
her
about
gibson
and
i
would
go
away
only
that
i
think
she
would
be
so
desolate
then
brooke
begged
her
never
to
allow
the
idea
of
leaving
miss
stanbury
to
enter
her
head
because
miss
stanbury
was
capricious
he
said
not
on
that
account
should
her
caprices
either
be
indulged
or
permitted
that
was
his
doctrine
respecting
miss
stanbury
and
he
declared
that
as
regarded
himself
he
would
never
be
either
disrespectful
to
her
or
submissive
it
is
a
great
mistake
he
said
to
think
that
anybody
is
either
an
angel
or
a
devil
when
dorothy
expressed
an
opinion
that
with
some
people
angelic
tendencies
were
predominant
and
with
others
diabolic
tendencies
he
assented
but
declared
that
it
was
not
always
easy
to
tell
the
one
tendency
from
the
other
at
last
when
dorothy
had
made
about
five
attempts
to
go
gibson
name
was
mentioned
i
am
very
glad
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
gibson
said
he
illustration
brooke
burgess
takes
his
leave
i
do
know
why
you
should
be
glad
because
i
should
not
have
liked
your
husband
not
as
your
husband
he
is
an
excellent
man
i
sure
said
dorothy
nevertheless
i
am
very
glad
but
i
did
not
think
you
would
accept
him
and
i
congratulate
you
on
your
escape
you
would
have
been
nothing
to
me
as
mrs
gibson
should
i
said
dorothy
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
but
now
i
think
we
shall
always
be
friends
i
sure
i
hope
so
burgess
but
indeed
i
must
go
now
it
is
ever
so
late
and
you
will
hardly
get
any
sleep
good
night
then
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
very
warmly
and
referring
to
a
promise
before
made
to
her
he
assured
her
that
he
would
certainly
make
acquaintance
with
her
brother
as
soon
as
he
was
back
in
london
dorothy
as
she
went
up
to
bed
was
more
than
ever
satisfied
with
herself
in
that
she
had
not
yielded
in
reference
to
gibson
chapter
xlv
trevelyan
at
venice
trevelyan
passed
on
moodily
and
alone
from
turin
to
venice
always
expecting
letters
from
bozzle
and
receiving
from
time
to
time
the
dispatches
which
that
functionary
forwarded
to
him
as
must
be
acknowledged
with
great
punctuality
for
bozzle
did
his
work
not
only
with
a
conscience
but
with
a
will
he
was
now
as
he
had
declared
more
than
once
altogether
devoted
to
interest
and
as
he
was
an
active
enterprising
man
always
on
the
alert
to
be
doing
something
and
as
he
loved
the
work
of
writing
dispatches
trevelyan
received
a
great
many
letters
from
bozzle
it
is
not
exaggeration
to
say
that
every
letter
made
him
for
the
time
a
very
wretched
man
this
wrote
of
the
wife
of
his
bosom
of
her
who
had
been
the
wife
of
his
bosom
and
who
was
the
mother
of
his
child
who
was
at
this
very
time
the
only
woman
whom
he
loved
with
an
entire
absence
of
delicacy
bozzle
would
have
thought
reticence
on
his
part
to
be
dishonest
we
remember
othello
demand
of
iago
that
was
the
demand
which
bozzle
understood
that
trevelyan
had
made
of
him
and
he
was
minded
to
obey
that
order
but
trevelyan
though
he
had
in
truth
given
the
order
was
like
othello
also
in
this
that
he
would
have
preferred
before
all
the
prizes
of
the
world
to
have
had
proof
brought
home
to
him
exactly
opposite
to
that
which
he
demanded
but
there
was
nothing
so
terrible
to
him
as
the
grinding
suspicion
that
he
was
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
bozzle
could
find
out
facts
therefore
he
gave
in
effect
the
same
order
that
othello
gave
and
bozzle
went
to
work
determined
to
obey
it
there
came
many
dispatches
to
venice
and
at
last
there
came
one
which
created
a
correspondence
which
shall
be
given
here
at
length
the
first
is
a
letter
from
bozzle
to
his
employer
stony
walk
union
street
borough
september
hond
sir
since
i
wrote
yesterday
morning
something
has
occurred
which
it
may
be
and
i
think
it
will
will
help
to
bring
this
melancholy
affair
to
a
satisfactory
termination
and
conclusion
i
had
better
explain
trewilyan
how
i
have
been
at
work
from
the
beginning
about
watching
the
colonel
i
could
do
nothing
with
the
porter
at
the
albany
which
he
is
always
mostly
muzzled
with
beer
and
he
would
have
taken
my
money
not
on
the
square
so
when
it
was
tellegrammed
to
me
as
the
colonel
was
on
the
move
in
the
north
i
put
on
two
boys
as
knows
the
colonel
at
eighteenpence
a
day
at
each
end
one
piccadilly
end
and
the
other
saville
row
end
and
yesterday
morning
as
quick
as
ever
could
be
after
the
limited
express
edinburgh
male
up
was
in
there
comes
the
saville
row
end
boy
here
to
say
as
the
colonel
was
lodged
safe
in
his
downey
then
i
was
off
immediate
myself
to
diddulph
because
i
knows
what
it
is
to
trust
to
inferiors
when
matters
gets
delicate
now
there
had
been
no
letters
from
the
colonel
nor
none
to
him
as
i
could
make
out
though
that
might
be
so
sure
she
might
have
had
addressed
to
a
or
the
like
of
that
at
any
of
the
as
was
distant
as
nobody
could
give
the
notice
to
all
barring
the
money
which
i
know
an
object
when
the
end
is
so
desirable
it
do
do
to
be
too
ubiketous
because
things
will
go
astray
but
kept
my
eye
uncommon
open
and
i
do
think
there
have
been
no
letters
since
that
last
which
was
sent
trewilyan
let
any
of
parsons
or
what
not
say
what
they
will
and
i
do
see
as
parsons
are
better
than
other
folk
when
they
has
to
do
with
a
lady
as
likes
her
trevelyan
when
he
had
read
as
far
as
this
threw
down
the
letter
and
tore
his
hair
in
despair
my
wife
he
exclaimed
oh
my
wife
but
it
was
essential
that
he
should
read
bozzle
letter
and
he
persevered
well
i
took
to
the
ground
myself
as
soon
as
ever
i
heard
that
the
colonel
was
among
us
and
i
hung
out
at
the
full
moon
they
had
been
quite
on
the
square
with
me
at
the
full
moon
which
i
mention
because
of
course
it
has
to
be
remembered
and
it
do
come
up
as
a
hitem
and
proud
trewilyan
as
i
did
take
to
the
ground
myself
for
what
should
happen
but
i
see
the
colonel
as
large
as
life
ringing
at
the
parson
bell
at
he
was
let
in
at
and
he
was
let
out
at
he
went
away
in
a
cab
which
it
was
kept
and
i
followed
him
till
he
was
put
down
at
the
arcade
and
i
left
him
having
his
washed
and
greased
at
trufitt
rooms
up
it
was
a
wonder
to
me
when
i
see
this
trewilyan
as
he
have
his
done
first
as
they
most
of
does
when
they
going
to
see
their
ladies
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
that
though
i
did
try
to
put
too
and
too
together
as
i
always
does
what
he
did
at
the
parson
trewilyan
i
say
i
saw
and
i
wo
say
i
know
it
my
opinion
the
young
woman
there
is
on
the
square
though
been
remembered
too
and
is
a
hitem
of
course
and
trewilyan
it
do
go
against
the
grain
with
me
when
remembered
and
ai
on
the
square
i
does
expect
too
much
of
human
nature
which
is
poor
as
the
saying
goes
but
when
they
remembered
and
ai
on
the
square
after
that
it
too
bad
for
human
nature
it
more
than
poor
it
what
i
calls
beggarly
he
ai
been
there
since
trewilyan
and
he
goes
out
of
town
by
the
express
to
bridport
so
he
lets
on
but
of
course
i
shall
see
to
that
that
been
at
diddulph
in
the
house
from
to
you
may
take
as
a
fact
there
wo
be
no
shaking
of
that
because
i
have
it
in
my
mem
book
and
no
counsel
can
get
the
better
of
it
of
course
he
went
there
to
see
her
and
it
my
belief
he
did
the
young
woman
as
was
remembered
says
he
did
but
she
is
on
the
square
they
never
is
when
a
lady
wants
to
see
her
gentleman
though
they
comes
round
afterwards
and
tells
up
everything
when
it
comes
before
his
ordinary
lordship
if
you
ask
me
trewilyan
i
do
think
it
ripe
yet
for
the
court
but
we
have
it
ripe
before
long
keep
a
because
it
just
possible
she
may
leave
town
if
she
do
i
be
down
upon
them
together
and
no
mistake
yours
most
respectful
bozzle
every
word
in
the
letter
had
been
a
dagger
to
trevelyan
and
yet
he
felt
himself
to
be
under
an
obligation
to
the
man
who
had
written
it
no
one
else
would
or
could
make
facts
known
to
him
if
she
were
innocent
let
him
know
that
she
were
innocent
and
he
would
proclaim
her
innocence
and
believe
in
her
innocence
and
sacrifice
himself
to
her
innocence
if
such
sacrifice
were
necessary
but
if
she
were
guilty
let
him
also
know
that
he
knew
how
bad
it
was
all
that
bribing
of
postmen
and
maidservants
who
took
his
money
and
her
money
also
very
likely
it
was
dirt
all
of
it
but
who
had
put
him
into
the
dirt
his
wife
had
at
least
deceived
him
had
deceived
him
and
disobeyed
him
and
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
know
the
facts
life
without
a
bozzle
would
now
have
been
to
him
a
perfect
blank
the
colonel
had
been
to
the
parsonage
at
diddulph
and
had
been
admitted
as
to
that
he
had
no
doubt
nor
did
he
really
doubt
that
his
wife
had
seen
the
visitor
he
had
sent
his
wife
first
into
a
remote
village
on
dartmoor
and
there
she
had
been
visited
by
her
lover
how
was
he
to
use
any
other
word
iago
oh
iago
the
pity
of
it
iago
then
when
she
had
learned
that
this
was
discovered
she
had
left
the
retreat
in
which
he
had
placed
her
without
permission
from
him
and
had
taken
herself
to
the
house
of
a
relative
of
hers
here
she
was
visited
again
by
her
lover
oh
iago
the
pity
of
it
iago
and
then
there
had
been
between
them
an
almost
constant
correspondence
so
much
he
had
ascertained
as
fact
but
he
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
bozzle
had
learned
all
the
facts
there
might
be
correspondence
or
even
visits
of
which
bozzle
could
learn
nothing
how
could
bozzle
know
where
trevelyan
was
during
all
those
hours
which
colonel
osborne
passed
in
london
that
which
he
knew
he
knew
absolutely
and
on
that
he
could
act
but
there
was
of
course
much
of
which
he
knew
nothing
gradually
the
truth
would
unveil
itself
and
then
he
would
act
he
would
tear
that
colonel
into
fragments
and
throw
his
wife
from
him
with
all
the
ignominy
which
the
law
made
possible
to
him
but
in
the
meantime
he
wrote
a
letter
to
outhouse
colonel
osborne
after
all
that
had
been
said
had
been
admitted
at
the
parsonage
and
trevelyan
was
determined
to
let
the
clergyman
know
what
he
thought
about
it
the
oftener
he
turned
the
matter
in
his
mind
as
he
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
piazza
of
mark
the
more
absurd
it
appeared
to
him
to
doubt
that
his
wife
had
seen
the
man
of
course
she
had
seen
him
he
walked
there
nearly
the
whole
night
thinking
of
it
and
as
he
dragged
himself
off
at
last
to
his
inn
had
almost
come
to
have
but
one
desire
namely
that
he
should
find
her
out
that
the
evidence
should
be
conclusive
that
it
should
be
proved
and
so
brought
to
an
end
then
he
would
destroy
her
and
destroy
that
man
and
afterwards
destroy
himself
so
bitter
to
him
would
be
his
ignominy
he
almost
revelled
in
the
idea
of
the
tragedy
he
would
make
it
was
three
before
he
was
in
his
bedroom
and
then
he
wrote
his
letter
to
outhouse
before
he
took
himself
to
his
bed
it
was
as
follows
venice
sir
information
of
a
certain
kind
on
which
i
can
place
a
firm
reliance
has
reached
me
to
the
effect
that
colonel
osborne
has
been
allowed
to
visit
at
your
house
during
the
sojourn
of
my
wife
under
your
roof
i
will
thank
you
to
inform
me
whether
this
be
true
as
although
i
am
confident
of
my
facts
it
is
necessary
in
reference
to
my
ulterior
conduct
that
i
should
have
from
you
either
an
admission
or
a
denial
of
my
assertion
it
is
of
course
open
to
you
to
leave
my
letter
unanswered
should
you
think
proper
to
do
so
i
shall
know
also
how
to
deal
with
that
fact
as
to
your
conduct
in
admitting
colonel
osborne
into
your
house
while
my
wife
is
there
after
all
that
has
passed
and
all
that
you
know
that
has
passed
i
am
quite
unable
to
speak
with
anything
like
moderation
of
feeling
had
the
man
succeeded
in
forcing
himself
into
your
residence
you
should
have
been
the
first
to
give
me
notice
of
it
as
it
is
i
have
been
driven
to
ascertain
the
fact
from
other
sources
i
think
that
you
have
betrayed
the
trust
that
a
husband
has
placed
in
you
and
that
you
will
find
from
the
public
voice
that
you
will
be
regarded
as
having
disgraced
yourself
as
a
clergyman
in
reference
to
my
wife
herself
i
would
wish
her
to
know
that
after
what
has
now
taken
place
i
shall
not
feel
myself
justified
in
leaving
our
child
longer
in
her
hands
even
tender
as
are
his
years
i
shall
take
steps
for
having
him
removed
what
further
i
shall
do
to
vindicate
myself
and
extricate
myself
as
far
as
may
be
possible
from
the
slough
of
despond
in
which
i
have
been
submerged
she
and
you
will
learn
in
due
time
your
obedient
servant
trevelyan
a
letter
addressed
poste
restante
venice
will
reach
me
here
if
trevelyan
was
mad
when
he
wrote
this
letter
outhouse
was
very
nearly
as
mad
when
he
read
it
he
had
most
strongly
desired
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
wife
niece
when
she
was
separated
from
her
husband
he
was
a
man
honest
charitable
and
sufficiently
affectionate
but
he
was
timid
and
disposed
to
think
ill
of
those
whose
modes
of
life
were
strange
to
him
actuated
by
these
feelings
he
would
have
declined
to
offer
the
hospitality
of
his
roof
to
trevelyan
had
any
choice
been
left
to
him
but
there
had
been
no
choice
she
had
come
thither
unasked
with
her
boy
and
baggage
and
he
could
not
send
her
away
his
wife
had
told
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
protect
these
women
till
their
father
came
and
he
recognised
the
truth
of
what
his
wife
said
there
they
were
and
there
they
must
remain
throughout
the
winter
it
was
hard
upon
him
especially
as
the
difficulties
and
embarrassments
as
to
money
were
so
disagreeable
to
him
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
his
duty
must
be
done
though
it
were
ever
so
painful
then
that
horrid
colonel
had
come
and
now
had
come
this
letter
in
which
he
was
not
only
accused
of
being
an
accomplice
between
his
married
niece
and
her
lover
but
was
also
assured
that
he
should
be
held
up
to
public
ignominy
and
disgrace
though
he
had
often
declared
that
trevelyan
was
mad
he
would
not
remember
that
now
such
a
letter
as
he
had
received
should
have
been
treated
by
him
as
the
production
of
a
madman
but
he
was
not
sane
enough
himself
to
see
the
matter
in
that
light
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
fist
and
was
almost
beside
himself
as
he
read
the
letter
a
second
time
there
had
been
a
method
in
trevelyan
madness
for
though
he
had
declared
to
himself
that
without
doubt
bozzle
had
been
right
in
saying
that
as
the
colonel
had
been
at
the
parsonage
therefore
as
a
certainty
trevelyan
had
met
the
colonel
there
yet
he
had
not
so
stated
in
his
letter
he
had
merely
asserted
that
colonel
osborne
had
been
at
the
house
and
had
founded
his
accusation
upon
that
alleged
fact
the
alleged
fact
had
been
in
truth
a
fact
so
far
bozzle
had
been
right
the
colonel
had
been
at
the
parsonage
and
the
reader
knows
how
far
outhouse
had
been
to
blame
for
his
share
in
the
matter
he
rushed
off
to
his
wife
with
the
letter
declaring
at
first
that
trevelyan
nora
and
the
child
and
the
servant
should
be
sent
out
of
the
house
at
once
but
at
last
outhouse
succeeded
in
showing
him
that
he
would
not
be
justified
in
them
because
trevelyan
had
him
but
i
will
write
to
him
said
outhouse
he
shall
know
what
i
think
about
it
and
he
did
write
his
letter
that
day
in
spite
of
his
wife
entreaties
that
he
would
allow
the
sun
to
set
upon
his
wrath
and
his
letter
was
as
follows
diddulph
october
sir
i
have
received
your
letter
of
the
which
is
more
iniquitous
unjust
and
ungrateful
than
anything
i
ever
before
saw
written
i
have
been
surprised
from
the
first
at
your
gross
cruelty
to
your
unoffending
wife
but
even
that
seems
to
me
more
intelligible
than
your
conduct
in
writing
such
words
as
those
which
you
have
dared
to
send
to
me
for
your
wife
sake
knowing
that
she
is
in
a
great
degree
still
in
your
power
i
will
condescend
to
tell
you
what
has
happened
when
trevelyan
found
herself
constrained
to
leave
nuncombe
putney
by
your
aspersions
on
her
character
she
came
here
to
the
protection
of
her
nearest
relatives
within
reach
till
her
father
and
mother
should
be
in
england
sorely
against
my
will
i
received
them
into
my
home
because
they
had
been
deprived
of
other
shelter
by
the
cruelty
or
madness
of
him
who
should
have
been
their
guardian
here
they
are
and
here
they
shall
remain
till
sir
marmaduke
rowley
arrives
the
other
day
on
the
of
september
colonel
osborne
who
is
their
father
old
friend
called
not
on
them
but
on
me
i
may
truly
say
that
i
did
not
wish
to
see
colonel
osborne
they
did
not
see
him
nor
did
he
ask
to
see
them
if
his
coming
was
a
fault
and
i
think
it
was
a
fault
they
were
not
implicated
in
it
he
came
remained
a
few
minutes
and
went
without
seeing
any
one
but
myself
that
is
the
history
of
colonel
osborne
visit
to
my
house
i
have
not
thought
fit
to
show
your
letter
to
your
wife
or
to
make
her
acquainted
with
this
further
proof
of
your
want
of
reason
as
to
the
threats
which
you
hold
out
of
removing
her
child
from
her
you
can
of
course
do
nothing
except
by
law
i
do
not
think
that
even
you
will
be
sufficiently
audacious
to
take
any
steps
of
that
description
whatever
protection
the
law
may
give
her
and
her
child
from
your
tyranny
and
misconduct
can
not
be
obtained
till
her
father
shall
be
here
i
have
only
further
to
request
that
you
will
not
address
any
further
communication
to
me
should
you
do
so
it
will
be
refused
yours
in
deep
indignation
oliphant
outhouse
trevelyan
had
also
written
two
other
letters
to
england
one
to
bideawhile
and
the
other
to
bozzle
in
the
former
he
acquainted
the
lawyer
that
he
had
discovered
that
his
wife
still
maintained
her
intercourse
with
colonel
osborne
and
that
he
must
therefore
remove
his
child
from
her
custody
he
then
inquired
what
steps
would
be
necessary
to
enable
him
to
obtain
possession
of
his
little
boy
in
the
letter
to
bozzle
he
sent
a
cheque
and
his
thanks
for
the
watchful
care
he
desired
bozzle
to
continue
his
precautions
and
explained
his
intentions
about
his
son
being
somewhat
afraid
that
bideawhile
might
not
be
zealous
on
his
behalf
and
not
himself
understanding
accurately
the
extent
of
his
power
with
regard
to
his
own
child
or
the
means
whereby
he
might
exercise
it
he
was
anxious
to
obtain
assistance
from
bozzle
also
on
this
point
he
had
no
doubt
that
bozzle
knew
all
about
it
he
had
great
confidence
in
bozzle
but
still
he
did
not
like
to
consult
the
he
knew
that
it
became
him
to
have
some
regard
for
his
own
dignity
he
therefore
put
the
matter
very
astutely
to
bozzle
asking
no
questions
but
alluding
to
his
difficulty
in
a
way
that
would
enable
bozzle
to
offer
advice
and
where
was
he
to
get
a
woman
to
take
charge
of
his
child
if
lady
milborough
would
do
it
how
great
would
be
the
comfort
but
he
was
almost
sure
that
lady
milborough
would
not
do
it
all
his
friends
had
turned
against
him
and
lady
milborough
among
the
number
there
was
nobody
left
to
him
but
bozzle
could
he
entrust
bozzle
to
find
some
woman
for
him
who
would
take
adequate
charge
of
the
little
fellow
till
he
himself
could
see
to
the
child
education
he
did
not
put
this
question
to
bozzle
in
plain
terms
but
he
was
very
astute
and
wrote
in
such
a
fashion
that
bozzle
could
make
a
proposal
if
any
proposal
were
within
his
power
the
answer
from
outhouse
came
first
to
this
trevelyan
paid
very
little
attention
it
was
just
what
he
expected
of
course
outhouse
assurance
about
colonel
osborne
went
for
nothing
a
man
who
would
permit
intercourse
in
his
house
between
a
married
lady
and
her
lover
would
not
scruple
to
deny
that
he
had
permitted
it
then
came
bideawhile
answer
which
was
very
short
bideawhile
said
that
nothing
could
be
done
about
the
child
till
trevelyan
should
return
to
england
and
that
he
could
give
no
opinion
as
to
what
should
be
done
then
till
he
knew
more
of
the
circumstances
it
was
quite
clear
to
trevelyan
that
he
must
employ
some
other
lawyer
bideawhile
had
probably
been
corrupted
by
colonel
osborne
could
bozzle
recommend
a
lawyer
from
bozzle
himself
there
came
no
other
immediate
reply
than
his
duty
and
that
he
would
make
further
inquiries
chapter
xlvi
the
american
minister
in
the
second
week
in
october
glascock
returned
to
florence
intending
to
remain
there
till
the
weather
should
have
become
bearable
at
naples
his
father
was
said
to
be
better
but
was
in
such
a
condition
as
hardly
to
receive
much
comfort
from
his
presence
his
mind
was
gone
and
he
knew
no
one
but
his
nurse
and
though
glascock
was
unwilling
to
put
himself
altogether
out
of
the
reach
of
returning
at
a
day
notice
he
did
not
find
himself
obliged
to
remain
in
naples
during
the
heat
of
the
autumn
so
glascock
returned
to
the
hotel
at
florence
accompanied
by
the
tall
man
who
wore
the
buttons
the
did
not
allow
such
a
light
to
remain
long
hidden
under
a
bushel
and
it
was
soon
spread
far
and
wide
that
the
honourable
charles
glascock
and
his
suite
were
again
in
the
beautiful
city
and
the
fact
was
soon
known
to
the
american
minister
and
his
family
spalding
was
a
man
who
at
home
had
been
very
hostile
to
english
interests
many
american
gentlemen
are
known
for
such
hostility
they
make
speeches
about
the
country
as
though
they
thought
that
war
with
england
would
produce
certain
triumph
to
the
states
certain
increase
to
american
trade
and
certain
downfall
to
a
tyranny
which
no
nation
ought
to
endure
but
such
is
hardly
their
real
opinion
there
in
the
states
as
also
here
in
england
you
shall
from
day
to
day
hear
men
propounding
in
very
loud
language
advanced
theories
of
political
action
the
assertion
of
which
is
supposed
to
be
necessary
to
the
end
which
they
have
in
view
men
whom
we
know
to
have
been
as
mild
as
sucking
doves
in
the
political
aspiration
of
their
whole
lives
suddenly
jump
up
and
with
infuriated
gestures
declare
themselves
the
enemies
of
everything
existing
when
they
have
attained
their
little
purpose
or
have
failed
to
do
so
they
revert
naturally
into
their
elements
it
is
so
with
americans
as
frequently
as
with
ourselves
and
there
is
no
political
subject
on
which
it
is
considered
more
expedient
to
express
than
on
that
of
the
sins
of
england
it
is
understood
that
we
do
not
resent
it
it
is
presumed
that
we
regard
it
as
the
irishman
regarded
his
cuffs
in
the
states
a
large
party
which
consists
chiefly
of
those
who
have
lately
left
english
rule
and
who
are
keen
to
prove
to
themselves
how
wise
they
have
been
in
doing
so
is
pleased
by
this
strong
language
against
england
and
therefore
the
strong
language
is
spoken
but
the
speakers
who
are
probably
men
knowing
something
of
the
world
mean
it
not
at
all
they
have
no
more
idea
of
war
with
england
than
they
have
of
war
with
all
europe
and
their
respect
for
england
and
for
english
opinion
is
unbounded
in
their
political
tones
of
speech
and
modes
of
action
they
strive
to
be
as
english
as
possible
spalding
aspirations
were
of
this
nature
he
had
uttered
speeches
against
england
which
would
make
the
hair
stand
on
end
on
the
head
of
an
uninitiated
english
reader
he
had
told
his
countrymen
that
englishmen
hugged
their
chains
and
would
do
so
until
american
hammers
had
knocked
those
chains
from
off
their
wounded
wrists
and
bleeding
ankles
he
had
declared
that
if
certain
american
claims
were
not
satisfied
there
was
nothing
left
for
americans
to
do
but
to
cross
the
ferry
with
such
a
sheriff
officer
as
would
be
able
to
make
distraint
on
the
great
english
household
he
had
declared
that
the
sheriff
officer
would
have
very
little
trouble
he
had
spoken
of
canada
as
an
outlying
american
territory
not
yet
quite
sufficiently
redeemed
from
savage
life
to
be
received
into
the
union
as
a
state
there
is
a
multiplicity
of
subjects
of
this
kind
ready
to
the
hand
of
the
american
orator
spalding
had
been
quite
successful
and
was
now
minister
at
florence
but
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
coming
to
him
from
his
prosperity
was
the
enjoyment
of
the
society
of
englishmen
in
the
capital
to
which
he
had
been
sent
when
therefore
his
wife
and
nieces
pointed
out
to
him
the
fact
that
it
was
manifestly
his
duty
to
call
upon
glascock
after
what
had
passed
between
them
on
that
night
under
the
campanile
he
did
not
rebel
for
an
instant
against
the
order
given
to
him
his
mind
never
reverted
for
a
moment
to
that
opinion
which
had
gained
for
him
such
a
round
of
applause
when
expressed
on
the
platform
of
the
temperance
hall
at
nubbly
creek
state
of
illinois
to
the
effect
that
the
english
aristocrat
and
who
inherited
acres
and
titles
from
his
father
could
never
be
fitting
company
for
a
thoughtful
christian
american
citizen
he
at
once
had
his
hat
brushed
and
took
up
his
best
gloves
and
umbrella
and
went
off
to
glascock
hotel
he
was
strictly
enjoined
by
the
ladies
to
fix
a
day
on
which
glascock
would
come
and
dine
at
the
american
embassy
has
come
back
to
see
you
said
olivia
to
her
elder
sister
they
had
always
called
him
since
the
initials
had
been
seen
on
the
travelling
bag
probably
said
carry
there
is
so
very
little
else
to
bring
people
to
florence
that
there
can
hardly
be
any
other
reason
for
his
coming
they
do
say
it
terribly
hot
at
naples
just
now
but
that
can
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
we
shall
see
said
livy
i
sure
he
in
love
with
you
he
looked
to
me
just
like
a
proper
sort
of
lover
for
you
when
i
saw
his
long
legs
creeping
up
over
our
heads
into
the
banquette
you
ought
to
have
been
very
much
obliged
to
his
long
legs
so
sick
as
you
were
at
the
time
i
like
him
amazingly
said
livy
legs
and
all
i
only
hope
uncle
jonas
wo
bore
him
so
as
to
prevent
his
coming
his
father
is
very
ill
said
carry
and
i
do
suppose
we
shall
see
him
at
all
but
the
american
minister
was
successful
he
found
glascock
sitting
in
his
smoking
a
cigar
and
reading
a
newspaper
the
english
aristocrat
seemed
very
glad
to
see
his
visitor
and
assumed
no
airs
at
all
the
american
altogether
forgot
his
speech
at
nubbly
creek
and
found
the
aristocrat
society
to
be
very
pleasant
he
lit
a
cigar
and
they
talked
about
naples
rome
and
florence
spalding
when
the
marbles
of
old
rome
were
mentioned
was
a
little
too
keen
in
insisting
on
the
merits
of
story
miss
hosmer
and
hiram
powers
and
hardly
carried
his
listener
with
him
in
the
parallel
which
he
drew
between
greenough
and
phidias
and
he
was
somewhat
repressed
by
the
apathetic
curtness
of
reply
when
he
suggested
that
the
victory
gained
by
the
gunboats
at
vicksburg
on
the
mississippi
was
vividly
brought
to
his
mind
by
an
account
which
he
had
just
been
reading
of
the
battle
of
actium
but
he
succeeded
in
inducing
glascock
to
accept
an
invitation
to
dinner
for
the
next
day
but
one
and
the
two
gentlemen
parted
on
the
most
amicable
terms
everybody
meets
everybody
in
florence
every
day
carry
and
livy
spalding
had
met
glascock
twice
before
the
dinner
at
their
uncle
house
so
that
they
met
at
dinner
quite
as
intimate
friends
spalding
had
very
large
rooms
up
three
flights
of
stairs
on
the
lungarno
the
height
of
her
abode
was
attributed
by
spalding
to
her
dread
of
mosquitoes
she
had
not
yet
learned
that
people
in
florence
require
no
excuse
for
being
asked
to
walk
up
three
flights
of
stairs
the
rooms
when
they
were
reached
were
very
lofty
floored
with
what
seemed
to
be
marble
and
were
of
a
nature
almost
to
warrant
spalding
in
feeling
that
nature
had
made
her
more
akin
to
an
italian
countess
than
to
a
matron
of
nubbly
creek
state
of
illinois
where
spalding
had
found
her
and
made
her
his
own
there
was
one
other
englishman
present
harris
hyde
granville
gore
from
the
foreign
office
now
serving
temporarily
at
the
english
legation
in
florence
and
an
american
jackson
unthank
a
man
of
wealth
and
taste
who
was
resolved
on
having
such
a
collection
of
pictures
at
his
house
in
baltimore
that
no
english
private
collection
should
in
any
way
come
near
to
it
and
a
tuscan
from
the
italian
foreign
office
to
whom
nobody
could
speak
except
harris
hyde
granville
gore
who
did
not
indeed
seem
to
enjoy
the
efforts
of
conversation
which
were
expected
of
him
the
italian
who
had
a
handle
to
his
name
he
was
a
count
buonarosci
took
spalding
in
to
dinner
spalding
had
been
at
great
trouble
to
ascertain
whether
this
was
proper
or
whether
she
should
not
entrust
herself
to
glascock
there
were
different
points
to
be
considered
in
the
matter
she
did
not
quite
know
whether
she
was
in
italy
or
in
america
she
had
glimmerings
on
the
subject
of
her
privilege
to
carry
her
own
nationality
into
her
own
and
then
she
was
called
upon
to
deal
between
an
italian
count
with
an
elder
brother
and
an
english
honourable
who
had
no
such
incumbrance
which
of
the
two
was
possessed
of
the
higher
rank
i
found
it
all
out
aunt
mary
said
livy
you
must
take
the
count
for
livy
wanted
to
give
her
sister
every
chance
how
have
you
found
it
out
said
the
aunt
you
may
be
sure
it
is
so
said
livy
and
the
lady
in
her
doubt
yielded
the
point
spalding
as
she
walked
along
the
passage
on
the
count
arm
determined
that
she
would
learn
italian
she
would
have
given
all
nubbly
creek
to
have
been
able
to
speak
a
word
to
count
buonarosci
to
do
her
justice
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
had
studied
a
few
words
but
her
courage
failed
her
and
she
could
not
speak
them
she
was
very
careful
however
that
gore
was
placed
in
the
chair
next
to
the
count
we
are
very
glad
to
see
you
here
said
spalding
addressing
himself
especially
to
glascock
as
he
stood
up
at
his
own
seat
at
the
round
table
in
leaving
my
own
country
sir
there
is
nothing
that
i
value
more
than
the
privilege
of
becoming
acquainted
with
those
whose
historic
names
and
existing
positions
are
of
such
inestimable
value
to
the
world
at
large
in
saying
this
spalding
was
not
in
the
least
insincere
nor
did
his
conscience
at
all
prick
him
in
reference
to
that
speech
at
nubbly
creek
on
both
occasions
he
half
thought
as
he
spoke
or
thought
that
he
thought
so
unless
it
be
on
subjects
especially
endeared
to
us
the
thoughts
of
but
few
of
us
go
much
beyond
this
glascock
who
sat
between
spalding
and
her
niece
was
soon
asked
by
the
elder
lady
whether
he
had
been
in
the
states
no
he
had
not
been
in
the
states
then
you
must
come
glascock
said
spalding
though
i
will
not
say
dwelling
as
we
now
are
in
the
metropolis
of
the
world
of
art
that
we
in
our
own
homes
have
as
much
of
the
outer
beauty
of
form
to
charm
the
stranger
as
is
to
be
found
in
other
lands
yet
i
think
that
the
busy
lives
of
men
and
the
varied
institutions
of
a
free
country
must
always
have
an
interest
peculiarly
their
own
glascock
declared
that
he
quite
agreed
with
her
and
expressed
a
hope
that
he
might
some
day
find
himself
in
new
york
you
would
like
it
at
all
said
carry
because
you
are
an
aristocrat
i
do
mean
that
it
would
be
your
fault
why
should
that
prevent
my
liking
it
even
if
i
were
an
aristocrat
one
half
of
the
people
would
run
after
you
and
the
other
half
would
run
away
from
you
said
carry
then
i
take
to
the
people
who
ran
after
me
and
would
not
regard
the
others
that
all
very
well
but
you
would
like
it
and
then
you
would
become
unfair
to
what
you
saw
when
some
of
our
speechifying
people
talked
to
you
about
our
institutions
through
their
noses
you
would
think
that
the
institutions
themselves
must
be
bad
and
we
have
nothing
to
show
except
our
institutions
what
are
american
institutions
asked
glascock
everything
is
an
institution
having
iced
water
to
drink
in
every
room
of
the
house
is
an
institution
having
hospitals
in
every
town
is
an
institution
travelling
altogether
in
one
class
of
railway
cars
is
an
institution
saying
sir
is
an
institution
teaching
all
the
children
mathematics
is
an
institution
plenty
of
food
is
an
institution
getting
drunk
is
an
institution
in
a
great
many
towns
lecturing
is
an
institution
there
are
plenty
of
them
and
some
are
very
good
but
you
would
like
it
at
any
rate
i
go
and
see
said
glascock
if
you
do
i
hope
we
may
be
at
home
said
miss
spalding
spalding
in
the
mean
time
with
the
assistance
of
his
countryman
the
man
of
taste
was
endeavouring
to
explain
a
certain
point
in
american
politics
to
the
count
as
in
doing
this
they
called
upon
gore
to
translate
every
speech
they
made
into
italian
and
as
gore
had
never
offered
his
services
as
an
interpreter
and
as
the
italian
did
not
quite
catch
the
subtle
meanings
of
the
americans
in
gore
tuscan
version
and
did
not
in
the
least
wish
to
understand
the
things
that
were
explained
to
him
gore
and
the
italian
began
to
think
that
the
two
americans
were
bores
the
truth
is
spalding
said
gore
i
got
such
a
cold
in
my
head
that
i
do
think
i
can
explain
it
any
more
then
livy
spalding
laughed
aloud
and
the
two
american
gentlemen
began
to
eat
their
dinner
it
sounds
ridiculous
it
said
gore
in
a
whisper
i
ought
not
to
have
laughed
i
know
said
livy
the
very
best
thing
you
could
have
done
i
sha
be
troubled
any
more
now
the
fact
is
i
know
just
nine
words
of
italian
now
there
is
a
difficulty
in
having
to
explain
the
whole
theory
of
american
politics
to
an
italian
who
does
want
to
know
anything
about
it
with
so
very
small
a
repertory
of
words
at
one
command
how
well
you
did
it
too
well
i
felt
that
so
well
that
unless
i
had
stopped
it
i
should
have
been
able
to
say
a
word
to
you
all
through
dinner
your
laughter
clenched
it
and
buonarosci
and
i
will
be
grateful
to
you
for
ever
after
the
ladies
went
there
was
rather
a
bad
half
hour
for
glascock
he
was
by
the
minister
and
found
it
oppressive
before
he
was
enabled
to
escape
into
the
glascock
said
the
minister
an
english
gentleman
sir
like
you
who
has
the
privilege
of
an
hereditary
seat
in
your
parliament
glascock
was
not
quite
sure
whether
he
were
being
accused
of
having
an
hereditary
seat
in
the
house
of
commons
but
he
would
not
stop
to
correct
any
possible
error
on
that
point
and
who
has
been
born
to
all
the
gifts
of
fortune
rank
and
social
eminence
should
never
think
that
his
education
is
complete
till
he
has
visited
our
great
cities
in
the
west
glascock
hinted
that
he
by
no
means
conceived
his
education
to
be
complete
but
the
minister
went
on
without
attending
to
this
till
you
have
seen
sir
what
men
can
do
who
are
placed
upon
the
earth
with
all
god
gifts
of
free
intelligence
free
air
and
a
free
soil
but
without
any
of
those
other
good
things
which
we
are
accustomed
to
call
the
gifts
of
fortune
you
can
never
become
aware
of
the
infinite
ingenuity
of
man
there
had
been
much
said
before
but
just
at
this
moment
gore
and
the
american
left
the
room
and
the
italian
followed
them
briskly
glascock
at
once
made
a
decided
attempt
to
bolt
but
the
minister
was
on
the
alert
and
was
too
quick
for
him
and
he
was
by
no
means
ashamed
of
what
he
was
doing
he
had
got
his
guest
by
the
coat
and
openly
declared
his
intention
of
holding
him
let
me
keep
you
for
a
few
minutes
sir
said
he
while
i
dilate
on
this
point
in
one
direction
in
the
female
spells
are
too
potent
for
us
male
orators
in
going
among
us
glascock
you
must
not
look
for
luxury
or
refinement
for
you
will
find
them
not
nor
must
you
hope
to
encounter
the
highest
order
of
erudition
the
lofty
summits
of
acquired
knowledge
tower
in
your
country
with
an
altitude
we
have
not
reached
yet
it
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
said
glascock
no
sir
in
our
new
country
and
in
our
new
cities
we
still
lack
the
luxurious
perfection
of
fastidious
civilisation
but
sir
regard
our
level
that
is
what
i
say
to
every
unprejudiced
britisher
that
comes
among
us
look
at
our
level
and
when
you
have
looked
at
our
level
i
think
that
you
will
confess
that
we
live
on
the
highest
that
the
world
has
yet
afforded
to
mankind
you
follow
my
meaning
mr
glascock
glascock
was
not
sure
that
he
did
but
the
minister
went
on
to
make
that
meaning
clear
it
is
the
multitude
that
with
us

into

sir
and

how

their
books
look
at
the

correspondence
of
our

and

and
see
how
they

we

sir

our

the
bright
sun
of
our
almighty
god
has
as
yet
shone
with
its
illuminating
splendour
in
this
improving
world
of
ours
it
is
because
we
are
a
young
people
sir
with
nothing
as
yet
near

us
of
the
decrepitude
of

the
weakness
of

sir
is
the
penalty
paid
by
the
folly
of

we
are
not

wise
sir

what
we

and
illustration
the
feud
between
miss
stanbury
and
gibson
raged
violently
in
exeter
and
produced
many
complications
which
were
very
difficult
indeed
of
management
each
belligerent
party
felt
that
a
special
injury
had
been
inflicted
upon
it
gibson
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
been
grossly
misused
by
miss
stanbury
the
elder
and
strongly
suspected
that
miss
stanbury
the
younger
had
had
a
hand
in
this
misconduct
it
had
been
positively
asserted
to
him
at
least
so
he
thought
but
in
this
was
probably
in
error
that
the
lady
would
accept
him
if
he
proposed
to
her
all
exeter
had
been
made
aware
of
the
intended
compact
he
indeed
had
denied
its
existence
to
miss
french
comforting
himself
as
best
he
might
with
the
reflection
that
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
but
when
he
counted
over
his
injuries
he
did
not
think
of
this
denial
all
exeter
so
to
say
had
known
of
it
and
yet
when
he
had
come
with
his
proposal
he
had
been
refused
without
a
moment
consideration
first
by
the
aunt
and
then
by
the
niece
and
after
that
had
been
violently
abused
and
at
last
turned
out
of
the
house
surely
no
gentleman
had
ever
before
been
subjected
to
so
violent
but
miss
stanbury
the
elder
was
quite
as
assured
that
the
injury
had
been
done
to
her
as
to
the
matter
of
the
compact
itself
she
knew
very
well
that
she
had
been
as
true
as
steel
she
had
done
everything
in
her
power
to
bring
about
the
marriage
she
had
been
generous
in
her
offers
of
money
she
had
used
all
her
powers
of
persuasion
on
dorothy
and
she
had
given
every
opportunity
to
gibson
it
was
not
her
fault
if
he
had
not
been
able
to
avail
himself
of
the
good
things
which
she
had
put
in
his
way
he
had
first
been
as
she
thought
ignorant
and
arrogant
fancying
that
the
good
things
ought
to
be
made
his
own
without
any
trouble
on
his
part
and
then
awkward
not
knowing
how
to
take
the
trouble
when
trouble
was
necessary
and
as
to
that
matter
of
abusive
language
and
turning
out
of
the
house
miss
stanbury
was
quite
convinced
that
she
was
sinned
against
and
not
herself
the
sinner
she
declared
to
martha
more
than
once
that
gibson
had
used
such
language
to
her
that
coming
out
of
a
clergyman
mouth
it
had
quite
dismayed
her
martha
who
knew
her
mistress
probably
felt
that
gibson
had
at
least
received
as
good
as
he
gave
but
she
had
made
no
attempt
to
set
her
mistress
right
on
that
point
but
the
cause
of
miss
stanbury
sharpest
anger
was
not
to
be
found
in
gibson
conduct
either
before
dorothy
refusal
of
his
offer
or
on
the
occasion
of
his
being
turned
out
of
the
house
a
base
rumour
was
spread
about
the
city
that
dorothy
stanbury
had
been
offered
to
gibson
that
gibson
had
civilly
declined
the
offer
and
that
hence
had
arisen
the
wrath
of
the
juno
of
the
close
now
this
was
not
to
be
endured
by
miss
stanbury
she
had
felt
even
in
the
moment
of
her
original
anger
against
gibson
that
she
was
bound
in
honour
not
to
tell
the
story
against
him
she
had
brought
him
into
the
little
difficulty
and
she
at
least
would
hold
her
tongue
she
was
quite
sure
that
dorothy
would
never
boast
of
her
triumph
and
martha
had
been
strictly
cautioned
as
indeed
also
had
brooke
burgess
the
man
had
behaved
like
an
idiot
miss
stanbury
said
but
he
had
been
brought
into
a
little
dilemma
and
nothing
should
be
said
about
it
from
the
house
in
the
close
but
when
the
other
rumour
reached
miss
stanbury
ears
when
crumbie
condoled
with
her
on
her
niece
misfortune
when
machugh
asked
whether
gibson
had
not
behaved
rather
badly
to
the
young
lady
then
our
juno
celestial
mind
was
filled
with
a
divine
anger
but
even
then
she
did
not
declare
the
truth
she
asked
a
question
of
crumbie
and
was
enabled
as
she
thought
to
trace
the
falsehood
to
the
frenches
she
did
not
think
that
gibson
could
on
a
sudden
have
become
so
base
a
liar
gibson
fast
and
loose
with
my
niece
she
said
to
machugh
you
have
not
got
the
story
quite
right
my
dear
friend
pray
believe
me
there
has
been
nothing
of
that
sort
i
dare
say
not
said
machugh
and
i
sure
i
do
care
gibson
has
been
going
to
marry
one
of
the
french
girls
for
the
last
ten
years
and
i
think
he
ought
to
make
up
his
mind
and
do
it
at
last
i
can
assure
you
he
is
quite
welcome
as
far
as
dorothy
is
concerned
said
miss
stanbury
without
a
doubt
the
opinion
did
prevail
throughout
exeter
that
gibson
who
had
been
regarded
time
out
of
mind
as
the
property
of
the
miss
frenches
had
been
angled
for
by
the
ladies
in
the
close
that
he
had
nearly
been
caught
but
that
he
had
slipped
the
hook
out
of
his
mouth
and
was
now
about
to
subside
quietly
into
the
net
which
had
been
originally
prepared
for
him
arabella
french
had
not
spoken
loudly
on
the
subject
but
camilla
had
declared
in
more
than
one
house
that
she
had
most
direct
authority
for
stating
that
the
gentleman
had
never
dreamed
of
offering
to
the
young
lady
why
he
should
not
do
so
if
he
pleases
i
do
know
said
camilla
only
the
fact
is
that
he
has
not
pleased
the
rumour
of
course
has
reached
him
and
as
we
happen
to
be
very
old
friends
we
have
authority
for
denying
it
altogether
all
this
came
round
to
miss
stanbury
and
she
was
divine
in
her
wrath
if
they
drive
me
to
it
she
said
to
dorothy
i
have
the
whole
truth
told
by
the
bellman
through
the
city
or
i
publish
it
in
the
county
gazette
pray
do
say
a
word
about
it
aunt
stanbury
it
is
those
odious
girls
he
there
now
every
day
why
should
he
go
there
aunt
stanbury
if
he
fool
enough
let
him
go
i
do
care
where
he
goes
but
i
do
care
about
these
lies
they
would
dare
to
say
it
only
they
think
my
mouth
is
closed
they
no
honour
themselves
but
they
screen
themselves
behind
mine
i
sure
they
wo
find
themselves
mistaken
in
what
they
trust
to
said
dorothy
with
a
spirit
that
her
aunt
had
not
expected
from
her
miss
stanbury
at
this
time
had
told
nobody
that
the
offer
to
her
niece
had
been
made
and
repeated
and
finally
rejected
but
she
found
it
very
difficult
to
hold
her
tongue
in
the
meantime
gibson
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
time
at
heavitree
it
should
not
perhaps
be
asserted
broadly
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
marriage
would
be
good
for
him
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
at
least
to
this
that
it
was
no
longer
to
be
postponed
without
a
balance
of
disadvantage
the
charybdis
in
the
close
drove
him
helpless
into
the
whirlpool
of
the
heavitree
scylla
he
had
no
longer
an
escape
from
the
perils
of
the
latter
shore
he
had
been
so
mauled
by
the
opposite
waves
that
he
had
neither
spirit
nor
skill
left
to
him
to
keep
in
the
middle
track
he
was
almost
daily
at
heavitree
and
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
from
himself
the
approach
of
his
doom
but
still
there
were
two
of
them
he
knew
that
he
must
become
a
prey
but
was
there
any
choice
left
to
him
as
to
which
siren
should
have
him
he
had
been
quite
aware
in
his
more
gallant
days
before
he
had
been
knocked
about
on
that
charybdis
rock
that
he
might
sip
and
taste
and
choose
between
the
sweets
he
had
come
to
think
lately
that
the
younger
young
lady
was
the
sweeter
eight
years
ago
indeed
the
passages
between
him
and
the
elder
had
been
tender
but
camilla
had
then
been
simply
a
romping
girl
hardly
more
than
a
year
or
two
beyond
her
teens
now
with
her
matured
charms
camilla
was
certainly
the
more
engaging
as
far
as
outward
form
went
arabella
cheeks
were
thin
and
long
and
her
front
teeth
had
come
to
show
themselves
her
eyes
were
no
doubt
still
bright
and
what
she
had
of
hair
was
soft
and
dark
but
it
was
very
thin
in
front
and
what
there
was
of
supplemental
mass
behind
the
bandbox
by
which
miss
stanbury
was
so
much
aggrieved
was
worn
with
an
indifference
to
the
lines
of
beauty
which
gibson
himself
found
to
be
very
depressing
a
man
with
a
fair
burden
on
his
back
is
not
a
grievous
sight
but
when
we
see
a
small
human
being
attached
to
a
bale
of
goods
which
he
can
hardly
manage
to
move
we
feel
that
the
poor
fellow
has
been
cruelly
overweighted
gibson
certainly
had
that
sensation
about
arabella
chignon
and
as
he
regarded
it
in
a
nearer
and
a
dearer
light
as
a
chignon
that
might
possibly
become
his
own
as
a
burden
which
in
one
sense
he
might
himself
be
called
upon
to
bear
as
a
domestic
utensil
which
he
himself
might
be
called
upon
to
inspect
and
perhaps
to
aid
the
shifting
on
and
the
shifting
off
he
did
begin
to
think
that
that
side
of
the
scylla
gulf
ought
to
be
avoided
if
possible
and
probably
this
propensity
on
his
part
this
feeling
that
he
would
like
to
reconsider
the
matter
dispassionately
before
he
gave
himself
up
for
good
to
his
old
love
may
have
been
increased
by
camilla
apparent
withdrawal
of
her
claims
he
felt
mildly
grateful
to
the
heavitree
household
in
general
for
accepting
him
in
this
time
of
his
affliction
but
he
could
not
admit
to
himself
that
they
had
a
right
to
decide
upon
him
in
private
conclave
and
allot
him
either
to
the
one
or
to
the
other
nuptials
without
consultation
with
himself
to
be
swallowed
up
by
scylla
he
now
recognised
as
his
doom
but
he
thought
he
ought
to
be
asked
on
which
side
of
the
gulf
he
would
prefer
to
go
down
the
way
in
which
camilla
spoke
of
him
as
a
thing
that
was
hers
but
another
and
the
way
in
which
arabella
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
hers
and
could
never
be
another
wounded
his
manly
pride
he
had
always
understood
that
he
might
have
his
choice
and
he
could
not
understand
that
the
little
mishap
which
had
befallen
him
in
the
close
was
to
rob
him
of
that
privilege
he
used
to
drink
tea
at
heavitree
in
those
days
on
one
evening
on
going
in
he
found
himself
alone
with
arabella
oh
gibson
she
said
we
were
sure
whether
you
come
and
mamma
and
camilla
have
gone
out
to
mrs
camadge
gibson
muttered
some
word
to
the
effect
that
he
hoped
he
had
kept
nobody
at
home
and
as
he
did
so
he
remembered
that
he
had
distinctly
said
that
he
would
come
on
this
evening
i
do
know
that
i
should
have
gone
said
arabella
because
i
am
not
quite
not
quite
myself
at
present
no
not
ill
not
at
all
do
you
know
what
it
is
gibson
to
be
to
be
to
be
not
quite
yourself
gibson
said
that
he
had
very
often
felt
like
that
and
one
ca
get
over
it
can
one
continued
arabella
there
comes
a
presentiment
that
something
is
going
to
happen
and
a
kind
of
belief
that
something
has
happened
though
you
do
know
what
and
the
heart
refuses
to
be
light
and
the
spirit
becomes
abashed
and
the
mind
though
it
creates
new
thoughts
will
not
settle
itself
to
its
accustomed
work
i
suppose
it
what
the
novels
have
called
melancholy
i
suppose
it
is
said
gibson
but
there
generally
some
cause
for
it
debt
for
instance
it
nothing
of
that
kind
with
me
it
no
debt
at
least
that
can
be
written
down
in
the
figures
of
ordinary
arithmetic
sit
down
gibson
and
we
will
have
some
tea
then
as
she
stretched
forward
to
ring
the
bell
he
thought
that
he
never
in
his
life
had
seen
anything
so
unshapely
as
that
huge
wen
at
the
back
of
her
head
monstrum
horrendum
informe
ingens
he
could
not
help
quoting
the
words
to
himself
she
was
dressed
with
some
attempt
at
being
smart
but
her
ribbons
were
soiled
and
her
lace
was
tawdry
and
the
fabric
of
her
dress
was
old
and
dowdy
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
feel
no
pride
in
calling
her
gibson
no
pleasure
in
having
her
all
to
himself
at
his
own
hearth
i
hope
we
shall
escape
the
bitterness
of
miss
stanbury
tongue
if
we
drink
tea
she
said
with
her
sweetest
smile
i
do
suppose
she
know
anything
about
it
she
knows
about
everything
gibson
it
astonishing
what
she
knows
she
has
eyes
and
ears
everywhere
i
should
care
if
she
did
see
and
hear
so
very
incorrectly
i
told
now
that
she
declares
but
it
does
signify
declares
what
asked
gibson
never
mind
but
was
it
odd
how
all
exeter
believed
that
you
were
going
to
be
married
in
that
house
and
to
live
there
all
the
rest
of
your
life
and
be
one
of
miss
stanbury
slaves
i
never
believed
it
mr
gibson
this
she
said
with
a
sad
smile
that
ought
to
have
brought
him
on
his
knees
in
spite
of
the
chignon
one
ca
help
these
things
said
gibson
i
never
could
have
believed
it
not
even
if
you
had
not
given
me
an
assurance
so
solemn
and
so
sweet
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
the
poor
man
had
given
the
assurance
and
could
not
deny
the
solemnity
and
the
sweetness
that
was
a
happy
moment
for
us
gibson
because
though
we
never
believed
it
when
it
was
dinned
into
our
ears
so
frequently
when
it
was
made
such
a
triumph
in
the
close
it
was
impossible
not
to
fear
that
there
might
be
something
in
it
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
make
some
reply
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
the
lie
he
had
told
but
he
could
not
untell
it
camilla
reproached
me
afterwards
for
asking
you
whispered
arabella
in
her
softest
tenderest
voice
she
said
that
it
was
unmaidenly
i
hope
you
did
not
think
it
unmaidenly
mr
gibson
oh
dear
no
not
at
all
said
he
arabella
french
was
painfully
alive
to
the
fact
that
she
must
do
something
she
had
her
fish
on
the
hook
but
of
what
use
is
a
fish
on
your
hook
if
you
can
not
land
him
when
could
she
have
a
better
opportunity
than
this
of
landing
the
scaly
darling
out
of
the
fresh
and
free
waters
of
his
bachelor
stream
and
sousing
him
into
the
pool
of
domestic
life
to
be
ready
there
for
her
own
household
purposes
i
had
known
you
so
long
gibson
she
said
and
had
valued
your
friendship
so
so
deeply
as
he
looked
at
her
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
shapeless
excrescence
to
which
his
eyes
had
been
so
painfully
called
by
miss
stanbury
satire
it
is
true
that
he
had
formerly
been
very
tender
with
her
but
she
had
not
then
carried
about
with
her
that
distorted
monster
he
did
not
believe
himself
to
be
at
all
bound
by
anything
which
had
passed
between
them
in
circumstances
so
very
different
but
yet
he
ought
to
say
something
he
ought
to
have
said
something
but
he
said
nothing
she
was
patient
however
very
patient
and
she
went
on
playing
him
with
her
hook
i
am
so
glad
that
i
did
not
go
out
with
mamma
it
has
been
such
a
pleasure
to
me
to
have
this
conversation
with
you
camilla
perhaps
would
say
that
i
am
unmaidenly
i
do
think
so
that
is
all
that
i
care
for
gibson
if
you
acquit
me
i
do
not
mind
who
accuses
i
should
not
like
to
suppose
that
you
thought
me
unmaidenly
anything
would
be
better
than
that
but
i
can
throw
all
such
considerations
to
the
wind
when
true
true
friendship
is
concerned
do
you
think
that
one
ought
mr
gibson
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
thing
at
the
back
of
her
head
he
would
have
done
it
now
nothing
but
that
gave
him
courage
to
abstain
it
grew
bigger
and
bigger
more
shapeless
monstrous
absurd
and
abominable
as
he
looked
at
it
nothing
should
force
upon
him
the
necessity
of
assisting
to
carry
such
an
abortion
through
the
world
one
ought
to
sacrifice
everything
to
friendship
said
gibson
except
he
meant
nothing
personal
something
special
in
the
way
of
an
opinion
was
expected
of
him
and
therefore
he
had
striven
to
say
something
special
but
she
was
in
tears
in
a
moment
oh
gibson
she
exclaimed
oh
mr
gibson
what
is
the
matter
miss
french
have
i
lost
your
respect
is
it
that
that
you
mean
certainly
not
miss
french
do
not
call
me
miss
french
or
i
shall
be
sure
that
you
condemn
me
miss
french
sounds
so
very
cold
you
used
to
call
me
bella
that
was
quite
true
but
it
was
long
ago
thought
gibson
before
the
monster
had
been
attached
will
you
not
call
me
bella
now
he
thought
that
he
had
rather
not
and
yet
how
was
he
to
avoid
it
on
a
sudden
he
became
very
crafty
had
it
not
been
for
the
sharpness
of
his
mother
wit
he
would
certainly
have
been
landed
at
that
moment
as
you
truly
observed
just
now
he
said
the
tongues
of
people
are
so
malignant
there
are
little
birds
that
hear
everything
i
do
care
what
the
little
birds
hear
said
miss
french
through
her
tears
i
am
a
very
unhappy
girl
i
know
that
and
i
do
care
what
anybody
says
it
is
nothing
to
me
what
anybody
says
i
know
what
i
feel
at
this
moment
there
was
some
dash
of
truth
about
her
the
fish
was
so
very
heavy
on
hand
that
do
what
she
would
she
could
not
land
him
her
hopes
before
this
had
been
very
low
hopes
that
had
once
been
high
but
they
had
been
depressed
gradually
and
in
the
slow
dull
routine
of
her
daily
life
she
had
learned
to
bear
disappointment
by
degrees
without
sign
of
outward
suffering
without
consciousness
of
acute
pain
the
task
of
her
life
had
been
weary
and
the
goal
was
ever
becoming
more
and
more
distant
but
there
had
been
still
a
chance
and
she
had
fallen
away
into
a
lethargy
of
lessening
expectation
from
which
joy
indeed
had
been
banished
but
in
which
there
had
been
nothing
of
agony
then
had
come
upon
the
whole
house
at
heavitree
the
great
stanbury
peril
and
arising
out
of
that
had
sprung
new
hopes
to
arabella
which
made
her
again
capable
of
all
the
miseries
of
a
foiled
ambition
she
could
again
be
patient
if
patience
might
be
of
any
service
but
in
such
a
condition
an
eternity
of
patience
is
simply
suicidal
she
was
willing
to
work
hard
but
how
could
she
work
harder
than
she
had
worked
poor
young
woman
perishing
beneath
an
incubus
which
a
false
idea
of
fashion
had
imposed
on
her
i
hope
i
have
said
nothing
that
makes
you
unhappy
pleaded
gibson
i
sure
i
have
meant
it
but
you
have
she
said
you
make
me
very
unhappy
you
condemn
me
i
see
you
do
and
if
i
have
done
wrong
it
has
been
all
because
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
but
who
says
you
have
done
wrong
you
wo
call
me
bella
because
you
say
the
little
birds
will
hear
it
if
i
do
care
for
the
little
birds
why
should
you
there
is
no
question
more
difficult
than
this
for
a
gentleman
to
answer
circumstances
do
not
often
admit
of
its
being
asked
by
a
lady
with
that
courageous
simplicity
which
had
come
upon
miss
french
in
this
moment
of
her
agonising
struggle
but
nevertheless
it
is
one
which
in
a
more
complicated
form
is
often
put
and
to
which
some
reply
more
or
less
complicated
is
expected
if
i
a
woman
can
dare
for
your
sake
to
encounter
the
public
tongue
will
you
a
man
be
afraid
the
true
answer
if
it
could
be
given
would
probably
be
this
i
am
afraid
though
a
man
because
i
have
much
to
lose
and
little
to
get
you
are
not
afraid
though
a
woman
because
you
have
much
to
get
and
little
to
lose
but
such
an
answer
would
be
uncivil
and
is
not
often
given
therefore
men
shuffle
and
lie
and
tell
themselves
that
in
love
love
here
being
taken
to
mean
all
antenuptial
contests
between
man
and
woman
everything
is
fair
gibson
had
the
above
answer
in
his
mind
though
he
did
not
frame
it
into
words
he
was
neither
sufficiently
brave
nor
sufficiently
cruel
to
speak
to
her
in
such
language
there
was
nothing
for
him
therefore
but
that
he
must
shuffle
and
lie
i
only
meant
said
he
that
i
would
not
for
worlds
do
anything
to
make
you
uneasy
she
did
not
see
how
she
could
again
revert
to
the
subject
of
her
own
christian
name
she
had
made
her
little
tender
loving
request
and
it
had
been
refused
of
course
she
knew
that
it
had
been
refused
as
a
matter
of
caution
she
was
not
angry
with
him
because
of
his
caution
as
she
had
expected
him
to
be
cautious
the
barriers
over
which
she
had
to
climb
were
no
more
than
she
had
expected
to
find
in
her
way
but
they
were
so
very
high
and
so
very
difficult
of
course
she
was
aware
that
he
would
escape
if
he
could
she
was
not
angry
with
him
on
that
account
anger
could
not
have
helped
her
indeed
she
did
not
price
herself
highly
enough
to
make
her
feel
that
she
would
be
justified
in
being
angry
it
was
natural
enough
that
he
want
her
she
knew
herself
to
be
a
poor
thin
vapid
tawdry
creature
with
nothing
to
recommend
her
to
any
man
except
a
sort
of
fashion
which
infatuated
as
she
was
she
attributed
in
a
great
degree
to
the
thing
she
carried
on
her
head
she
knew
nothing
she
could
do
nothing
she
possessed
nothing
she
was
not
angry
with
him
because
he
so
evidently
wished
to
avoid
her
but
she
thought
that
if
she
could
only
be
successful
she
would
be
good
and
loving
and
obedient
and
that
it
was
fair
for
her
at
any
rate
to
try
each
created
animal
must
live
and
get
its
food
by
the
gifts
which
the
creator
has
given
to
it
let
those
gifts
be
as
poor
as
they
may
let
them
be
even
as
distasteful
as
they
may
to
other
members
of
the
great
created
family
the
rat
the
toad
the
slug
the
flea
must
each
live
according
to
its
appointed
mode
of
existence
animals
which
are
parasites
by
nature
can
only
live
by
attaching
themselves
to
life
that
is
strong
to
arabella
gibson
would
be
strong
enough
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
could
fix
herself
permanently
upon
his
strength
that
would
be
her
proper
mode
of
living
she
was
not
angry
with
him
because
he
resisted
the
attempt
but
she
had
nothing
of
conscience
to
tell
her
that
she
should
spare
him
as
long
as
there
remained
to
her
a
chance
of
success
and
should
not
her
plea
of
excuse
her
justification
be
admitted
there
are
tormentors
as
to
which
no
man
argues
that
they
are
iniquitous
though
they
be
very
troublesome
he
either
rids
himself
of
them
or
suffers
as
quiescently
as
he
may
we
used
to
be
such
great
friends
she
said
still
crying
and
i
am
afraid
you
do
like
me
a
bit
now
indeed
i
do
i
have
always
liked
you
but
but
what
do
tell
me
what
the
but
means
i
will
do
anything
that
you
bid
me
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
after
such
a
promise
he
were
to
confide
to
her
his
feeling
that
the
chignon
which
she
wore
was
ugly
and
unbecoming
she
would
probably
be
induced
to
change
her
mode
of
it
was
a
foolish
idea
because
had
he
followed
it
out
he
would
have
seen
that
compliance
on
her
part
in
such
a
matter
could
only
be
given
with
the
distinct
understanding
that
a
certain
reward
should
be
the
consequence
when
an
unmarried
gentleman
calls
upon
an
unmarried
lady
to
change
the
fashion
of
her
personal
adornments
the
unmarried
lady
has
a
right
to
expect
that
the
unmarried
gentleman
means
to
make
her
his
wife
but
gibson
had
no
such
meaning
and
was
led
into
error
by
the
necessity
for
sudden
action
when
she
offered
to
do
anything
that
he
might
bid
her
do
he
could
not
take
up
his
hat
and
go
away
she
looked
up
into
his
face
expecting
that
he
would
give
her
some
order
and
he
fell
into
the
temptation
that
was
spread
for
him
if
i
might
say
a
word
he
began
you
may
say
anything
she
exclaimed
if
i
were
you
i
do
think
you
do
think
what
mr
gibson
he
found
it
to
be
a
matter
very
difficult
of
approach
do
you
know
i
do
think
the
fashion
that
has
come
up
about
wearing
your
hair
quite
suits
you
not
so
well
as
the
way
you
used
to
do
it
she
became
on
a
sudden
very
red
in
the
face
and
he
thought
that
she
was
angry
vexed
she
was
but
still
accompanying
her
vexation
there
was
a
remembrance
that
she
was
achieving
victory
even
by
her
own
humiliation
she
loved
her
chignon
but
she
was
ready
to
abandon
even
that
for
him
nevertheless
she
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
and
he
was
forced
to
continue
his
criticism
i
have
no
doubt
those
things
are
very
becoming
and
all
that
and
i
dare
say
they
are
comfortable
oh
very
she
said
but
there
was
a
simplicity
that
i
liked
about
the
other
could
it
be
then
that
for
the
last
five
years
he
had
stood
aloof
from
her
because
she
had
arrayed
herself
in
fashionable
attire
she
was
still
very
red
in
the
face
still
suffering
from
wounded
vanity
still
conscious
of
that
soreness
which
affects
us
all
when
we
are
made
to
understand
that
we
are
considered
to
have
failed
there
where
we
have
most
thought
that
we
excelled
but
her
womanly
art
enabled
her
quickly
to
conceal
the
pain
i
have
made
a
promise
she
said
and
you
will
find
that
i
will
keep
it
what
promise
asked
gibson
i
said
that
i
would
do
as
you
bade
me
and
so
i
will
i
would
have
done
it
sooner
if
i
had
known
that
you
wished
it
i
would
never
have
worn
it
at
all
if
i
had
thought
that
you
disliked
it
i
think
that
a
little
of
them
is
very
nice
said
gibson
gibson
was
certainly
an
awkward
man
but
there
are
men
so
awkward
that
it
seems
to
be
their
especial
province
to
say
always
the
very
worst
thing
at
the
very
worst
moment
she
became
redder
than
ever
as
she
was
thus
told
of
the
hugeness
of
her
favourite
ornament
she
was
almost
angry
now
but
she
restrained
herself
thinking
perhaps
of
how
she
might
teach
him
taste
in
days
to
come
as
he
was
teaching
her
now
i
will
change
it
she
said
with
a
smile
you
come
and
see
upon
this
he
got
up
and
took
his
hat
and
made
his
escape
assuring
her
that
he
would
come
and
see
her
on
the
morrow
she
let
him
go
now
without
any
attempt
at
further
tenderness
certainly
she
had
gained
much
during
the
interview
he
had
as
good
as
told
her
in
what
had
been
her
offence
and
of
course
when
she
had
remedied
that
offence
he
could
hardly
refuse
to
return
to
her
she
got
up
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
and
looked
at
her
head
in
the
glass
and
told
herself
that
the
pity
would
be
great
it
was
not
that
the
chignon
was
in
itself
a
thing
of
beauty
but
that
it
imparted
so
unmistakable
an
air
of
fashion
it
divested
her
of
that
dowdiness
which
she
feared
above
all
things
and
enabled
her
to
hold
her
own
among
other
young
women
without
feeling
that
she
was
absolutely
destitute
of
attraction
there
had
been
a
certain
homage
paid
to
it
which
she
had
recognised
and
enjoyed
but
it
was
her
ambition
to
hold
her
own
not
among
young
women
but
among
clergymen
wives
and
she
would
certainly
obey
his
orders
she
could
not
make
the
attempt
now
because
of
the
complications
but
she
certainly
would
make
it
before
she
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
would
explain
to
camilla
that
it
was
a
little
joke
between
herself
and
gibson
chapter
xlviii
gibson
is
punished
miss
stanbury
was
divine
in
her
wrath
and
became
more
and
more
so
daily
as
new
testimony
reached
her
of
dishonesty
on
the
part
of
the
frenches
and
of
treachery
on
the
part
of
gibson
and
these
people
so
empty
so
vain
so
weak
were
getting
the
better
of
her
were
conquering
her
were
robbing
her
of
her
prestige
and
her
ancient
glory
simply
because
she
herself
was
too
generous
to
speak
out
and
tell
the
truth
there
was
a
martyrdom
to
her
in
this
which
was
almost
unendurable
now
there
came
to
her
one
day
at
luncheon
time
on
the
day
succeeding
that
on
which
miss
french
had
promised
to
sacrifice
her
chignon
a
certain
clifford
from
budleigh
salterton
to
whom
she
was
much
attached
perhaps
the
distance
of
budleigh
salterton
from
exeter
added
somewhat
to
this
affection
so
that
clifford
was
almost
closer
to
our
friend
heart
even
than
machugh
who
lived
just
at
the
other
end
of
the
cathedral
and
in
truth
clifford
was
a
woman
more
serious
in
her
mode
of
thought
than
machugh
and
one
who
had
more
in
common
with
miss
stanbury
than
that
other
lady
clifford
had
been
a
miss
noel
of
doddiscombe
leigh
and
she
and
miss
stanbury
had
been
engaged
to
be
married
at
the
same
time
each
to
a
man
of
fortune
one
match
had
been
completed
in
the
ordinary
course
of
matches
what
had
been
the
course
of
the
other
we
already
know
but
the
friendship
had
been
maintained
on
very
close
terms
machugh
was
a
gallio
at
heart
anxious
chiefly
to
remove
from
herself
and
from
her
friends
also
all
the
troubles
of
life
and
make
things
smooth
and
easy
she
was
one
who
disregarded
great
questions
who
cared
little
or
nothing
what
people
said
of
her
who
considered
nothing
worth
the
trouble
of
a
fight
epicuri
de
grege
porca
but
there
was
nothing
swinish
about
clifford
of

she
took

in

she
was
a
tory
who
sorrowed
heartily
for
her
country
believing
that
it
was
being
brought
to
ruin
by
the
counsels
of
evil
men
she
prayed
daily
to
be
delivered
from
dissenters
radicals
and
wolves
in
clothing
by
which
latter
bad
name
she
meant
especially
a
certain
leading
politician
of
the
day
who
had
with
the
cunning
of
the
devil
tempted
and
perverted
the
virtue
of
her
own
political
friends
and
she
was
one
who
thought
that
the
slightest
breath
of
scandal
on
a
young
woman
name
should
be
stopped
at
once
an
antique
anxious
matron
was
clifford
and
very
dear
to
the
heart
of
miss
stanbury
after
lunch
was
over
on
the
day
in
question
clifford
got
miss
stanbury
into
some
closet
retirement
and
there
spoke
her
mind
as
to
the
things
which
were
being
said
it
had
been
asserted
in
her
presence
by
camilla
french
that
she
camilla
was
authorised
by
gibson
to
declare
that
he
had
never
thought
of
proposing
to
dorothy
stanbury
and
that
miss
stanbury
had
been
labouring
under
some
strange
misapprehension
in
the
matter
now
my
dear
i
do
care
very
much
for
the
young
lady
in
question
said
clifford
alluding
to
camilla
french
very
little
indeed
i
should
think
said
miss
stanbury
with
a
shake
of
her
head
quite
true
my
dear
but
that
does
not
make
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
the
less
efficacious
for
evil
she
clearly
insinuated
that
you
had
endeavoured
to
make
up
a
match
between
this
gentleman
and
your
niece
and
that
you
had
failed
so
much
was
at
least
true
miss
stanbury
felt
this
and
felt
also
that
she
could
not
explain
the
truth
even
to
her
dear
old
friend
in
the
midst
of
her
divine
wrath
she
had
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
had
brought
gibson
into
his
difficulty
and
that
it
would
not
become
her
to
tell
any
one
of
his
failure
and
in
this
matter
she
did
not
herself
accuse
gibson
she
believed
that
the
lie
originated
with
camilla
french
and
it
was
against
camilla
that
her
wrath
raged
the
fiercest
she
is
a
poor
mean
disappointed
thing
said
miss
stanbury
very
probably
but
i
think
i
should
ask
her
to
hold
her
tongue
about
miss
dorothy
said
clifford
the
consultation
in
the
closet
was
carried
on
for
about
and
then
miss
stanbury
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
descended
into
clifford
carriage
the
carriage
took
the
heavitree
road
and
deposited
miss
stanbury
at
the
door
of
french
house
the
walk
home
from
heavitree
would
be
nothing
and
clifford
proceeded
on
her
way
having
given
this
little
help
in
counsel
and
conveyance
to
her
friend
french
was
at
home
and
miss
stanbury
was
shown
up
into
the
room
in
which
the
three
ladies
were
sitting
illustration
miss
stanbury
visits
the
frenches
the
reader
will
doubtless
remember
the
promise
which
arabella
had
made
to
gibson
that
promise
she
had
already
fulfilled
to
the
amazement
of
her
mother
and
sister
and
when
miss
stanbury
entered
the
room
the
elder
daughter
of
the
family
was
seen
without
her
accustomed
if
the
truth
is
to
be
owned
miss
stanbury
gave
the
poor
young
woman
no
credit
for
her
new
simplicity
but
put
down
the
deficiency
to
the
charge
of
domestic
slatternliness
she
was
unjust
enough
to
declare
afterwards
that
she
had
found
arabella
french
only
half
dressed
at
between
three
and
four
in
the
afternoon
from
which
this
lesson
may
surely
be
learned
that
though
the
way
down
avernus
may
be
and
customarily
is
made
with
great
celerity
the
return
journey
if
made
at
all
must
be
made
slowly
a
young
woman
may
commence
in
chignons
by
attaching
any
amount
of
an
edifice
to
her
head
but
the
reduction
should
be
made
by
degrees
arabella
edifice
had
in
miss
stanbury
eyes
been
the
ugliest
thing
in
art
that
she
had
known
but
now
its
absence
offended
her
and
she
most
untruly
declared
that
she
had
come
upon
the
young
woman
in
the
middle
of
the
day
just
out
of
her
and
almost
in
her
and
the
whole
french
family
suffered
a
diminution
of
power
from
the
strange
phantasy
which
had
come
upon
arabella
they
all
felt
in
sight
of
the
enemy
that
they
had
to
a
certain
degree
lowered
their
flag
one
of
the
ships
at
least
had
shown
signs
of
striking
and
this
element
of
weakness
made
itself
felt
through
the
whole
fleet
arabella
herself
when
she
saw
miss
stanbury
was
painfully
conscious
of
her
head
and
wished
that
she
had
postponed
the
operation
till
the
evening
she
smiled
with
a
faint
watery
smile
and
was
aware
that
something
ailed
her
the
greetings
at
first
were
civil
but
very
formal
as
are
those
between
nations
which
are
nominally
at
peace
but
which
are
waiting
for
a
sign
at
which
each
may
spring
at
the
other
throat
in
this
instance
the
juno
from
the
close
had
come
quite
prepared
to
declare
her
casus
belli
as
complete
and
to
fling
down
her
gauntlet
unless
the
enemy
should
at
once
yield
to
her
everything
demanded
with
an
abject
submission
french
she
said
i
have
called
for
a
particular
purpose
and
i
must
address
myself
chiefly
to
miss
camilla
oh
certainly
said
french
i
shall
be
delighted
to
hear
anything
from
you
miss
stanbury
said
camilla
not
without
an
air
of
bravado
arabella
said
nothing
but
she
put
her
hand
up
almost
convulsively
to
the
back
of
her
head
i
have
been
told
by
a
friend
of
mine
miss
camilla
began
miss
stanbury
that
you
declared
yourself
in
her
presence
authorised
by
gibson
to
make
a
statement
about
my
niece
dorothy
may
i
ask
who
was
your
friend
demanded
french
it
was
clifford
of
course
said
camilla
there
is
nobody
else
would
try
to
make
difficulties
there
need
be
no
difficulty
at
all
miss
camilla
said
miss
stanbury
if
you
will
promise
me
that
you
will
not
repeat
the
statement
it
ca
be
true
but
it
is
true
said
camilla
what
is
true
asked
miss
stanbury
surprised
by
the
audacity
of
the
girl
it
is
true
that
gibson
authorised
us
to
state
what
i
did
state
when
clifford
heard
me
and
what
was
that
only
this
that
people
had
been
saying
all
about
exeter
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
to
a
young
lady
and
that
as
the
report
was
incorrect
and
as
he
had
never
had
the
remotest
idea
in
his
mind
of
making
the
young
lady
his
wife
camilla
as
she
said
this
spoke
with
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
putting
forward
her
chin
and
shaking
her
head
and
as
he
thought
it
was
uncomfortable
both
for
the
young
lady
and
for
himself
and
as
there
was
nothing
in
it
the
least
in
the
world
nothing
at
all
no
glimmer
of
a
foundation
for
the
report
it
would
be
better
to
have
it
denied
everywhere
that
is
what
i
said
and
we
had
authority
from
the
gentleman
himself
arabella
can
say
the
same
and
so
can
mamma
only
mamma
did
not
hear
him
nor
had
camilla
heard
him
but
that
incident
she
did
not
mention
the
circumstances
were
in
miss
stanbury
judgment
becoming
very
remarkable
she
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
camilla
she
did
not
believe
that
gibson
had
given
to
either
of
the
frenches
any
justification
for
the
statement
just
made
but
camilla
had
been
so
much
more
audacious
than
miss
stanbury
had
expected
that
that
lady
was
for
a
moment
struck
dumb
i
sure
miss
stanbury
said
french
we
do
want
to
give
any
offence
to
your
niece
very
far
from
it
my
niece
does
care
about
it
two
straws
said
miss
stanbury
it
is
i
that
care
and
i
care
very
much
the
things
that
have
been
said
have
been
altogether
false
how
false
miss
stanbury
asked
camilla
altogether
false
as
false
as
they
can
be
gibson
must
know
his
own
mind
said
camilla
my
dear
there
a
little
disappointment
said
miss
french
and
it
do
signify
there
no
disappointment
at
all
said
miss
stanbury
and
it
does
signify
very
much
now
that
i
begun
i
go
to
the
bottom
of
it
if
you
say
that
gibson
told
you
to
make
these
statements
i
go
to
gibson
i
have
it
out
somehow
you
may
have
what
you
like
out
for
us
miss
stanbury
said
camilla
i
do
believe
gibson
said
anything
of
the
kind
that
civil
said
camilla
but
why
should
he
asked
arabella
there
were
the
reports
you
know
said
french
and
why
should
he
deny
them
when
there
was
a
word
of
truth
in
them
continued
camilla
for
my
part
i
think
the
gentleman
is
bound
for
the
lady
sake
to
declare
that
there
nothing
in
it
when
there
is
nothing
in
it
this
was
more
than
miss
stanbury
could
bear
hitherto
the
enemy
had
seemed
to
have
the
best
of
it
camilla
was
firing
broadside
after
broadside
as
though
she
was
assured
of
victory
even
french
was
becoming
courageous
and
arabella
was
forgetting
the
place
where
her
chignon
ought
to
have
been
i
really
do
not
know
what
else
there
is
for
me
to
say
remarked
camilla
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
an
air
of
impudence
that
almost
drove
poor
miss
stanbury
frantic
it
was
on
her
tongue
to
declare
the
whole
truth
but
she
refrained
she
had
schooled
herself
on
this
subject
vigorously
she
would
not
betray
gibson
had
she
known
all
the
truth
or
had
she
believed
camilla
french
version
of
the
story
there
would
have
been
no
betrayal
but
looking
at
the
matter
with
such
knowledge
as
she
had
at
present
she
did
not
even
yet
feel
herself
justified
in
declaring
that
gibson
had
offered
his
hand
to
her
niece
and
had
been
refused
she
was
however
sorely
tempted
very
well
ladies
she
said
i
shall
now
see
gibson
and
ask
him
whether
he
did
give
you
authority
to
make
such
statements
as
you
have
been
spreading
abroad
everywhere
then
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
in
a
moment
gibson
was
among
them
he
was
true
to
his
promise
and
had
come
to
see
arabella
with
her
altered
but
he
had
come
at
this
hour
thinking
that
escape
in
the
morning
would
be
easier
and
quicker
than
it
might
have
been
in
the
evening
his
mind
had
been
full
of
arabella
and
her
even
up
to
the
moment
of
his
knocking
at
the
door
but
all
that
was
driven
out
of
his
brain
at
once
when
he
saw
miss
stanbury
here
is
gibson
himself
said
french
how
do
you
do
mr
gibson
said
miss
stanbury
with
a
very
stately
courtesy
they
had
never
met
since
the
day
on
which
he
had
been
as
he
stated
turned
out
of
miss
stanbury
house
he
now
bowed
to
her
but
there
was
no
friendly
greeting
and
the
frenches
were
able
to
congratulate
themselves
on
the
apparent
loyalty
to
themselves
of
the
gentleman
who
stood
among
them
i
have
come
here
gibson
continued
miss
stanbury
to
put
a
small
matter
right
in
which
you
are
concerned
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
insignificant
thing
in
the
world
said
camilla
very
likely
said
miss
stanbury
but
it
is
not
insignificant
to
me
miss
camilla
french
has
asserted
publicly
that
you
have
authorised
her
to
make
a
statement
about
my
niece
dorothy
gibson
looked
into
camilla
face
doubtingly
inquisitively
almost
piteously
you
had
better
let
her
go
on
said
camilla
she
will
make
a
great
many
mistakes
no
doubt
but
you
had
better
let
her
go
on
to
the
end
i
have
made
no
mistake
as
yet
miss
camilla
she
so
asserted
gibson
in
the
hearing
of
a
friend
of
mine
and
she
repeated
the
assertion
here
in
this
room
to
me
just
before
you
came
in
she
says
that
you
have
authorised
her
to
declare
that
that
that
i
had
better
speak
it
out
plainly
at
once
much
better
said
camilla
that
you
never
entertained
an
idea
of
offering
your
hand
to
my
niece
miss
stanbury
paused
and
gibson
jaw
fell
visibly
but
he
was
not
expected
to
speak
as
yet
and
miss
stanbury
continued
her
accusation
beyond
that
i
do
want
to
mention
my
niece
name
if
it
can
be
avoided
but
it
ca
be
avoided
said
camilla
if
you
please
i
will
continue
gibson
will
understand
me
i
will
not
if
i
can
help
it
mention
my
niece
name
again
gibson
but
i
still
have
that
confidence
in
you
that
i
do
not
think
that
you
would
have
made
such
a
statement
in
reference
to
yourself
and
any
young
lady
unless
it
were
some
young
lady
who
had
absolutely
thrown
herself
at
your
head
and
in
saying
this
she
paused
and
looked
very
hard
at
camilla
that
just
what
dorothy
stanbury
has
been
doing
said
camilla
she
has
been
doing
nothing
of
the
kind
and
you
know
she
has
said
miss
stanbury
raising
her
arm
as
though
she
were
going
to
strike
her
opponent
but
i
am
quite
sure
gibson
that
you
never
could
have
authorised
these
young
ladies
to
make
such
an
assertion
publicly
on
your
behalf
whatever
there
may
have
been
of
misunderstanding
between
you
and
me
i
ca
believe
that
of
you
then
she
paused
for
a
reply
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
set
us
right
on
that
point
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
gibson
position
was
one
of
great
discomfort
he
had
given
no
authority
to
any
one
to
make
such
a
statement
he
had
said
nothing
about
dorothy
stanbury
to
camilla
but
he
had
told
arabella
when
hard
pressed
by
that
lady
that
he
did
not
mean
to
propose
to
dorothy
he
could
not
satisfy
miss
stanbury
because
he
feared
arabella
he
could
not
satisfy
the
frenches
because
he
feared
miss
stanbury
i
really
do
not
think
said
he
that
we
ought
to
talk
about
a
young
lady
in
this
way
that
my
opinion
too
said
camilla
but
miss
stanbury
will
exactly
so
miss
stanbury
will
said
that
lady
gibson
i
insist
upon
it
that
you
tell
me
whether
you
did
give
any
such
authority
to
miss
camilla
french
or
to
miss
french
i
would
answer
her
if
i
were
you
said
camilla
i
really
do
think
this
can
do
any
good
said
french
and
it
is
so
very
harassing
to
our
nerves
said
arabella
nerves
pooh
exclaimed
miss
stanbury
now
gibson
i
am
waiting
for
an
answer
my
dear
miss
stanbury
i
really
think
it
better
the
situation
is
so
peculiar
and
upon
my
word
i
hardly
know
how
not
to
give
offence
which
i
would
do
for
the
world
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
wo
answer
my
question
demanded
miss
stanbury
i
really
think
that
i
had
better
hold
my
tongue
pleaded
gibson
you
are
quite
right
gibson
said
camilla
indeed
it
is
wisest
said
french
i
do
see
what
else
he
can
do
said
arabella
then
was
miss
stanbury
driven
altogether
beyond
her
powers
of
endurance
if
that
be
so
said
she
i
must
speak
out
though
i
should
have
preferred
to
hold
my
tongue
gibson
did
offer
to
my
niece
the
week
before
last
twice
and
was
refused
by
her
my
niece
dorothy
took
it
into
her
head
that
she
did
not
like
him
and
upon
my
word
i
think
she
was
right
we
should
have
said
nothing
about
this
not
a
word
but
when
these
false
assertions
are
made
on
gibson
alleged
authority
and
gibson
wo
deny
it
i
must
tell
the
truth
then
there
was
silence
among
them
for
a
few
seconds
and
gibson
struggled
hard
but
vainly
to
clothe
his
face
in
a
pleasant
smile
gibson
is
that
true
said
miss
stanbury
but
gibson
made
no
reply
it
is
as
true
as
heaven
said
miss
stanbury
striking
her
hand
upon
the
table
and
now
you
had
better
all
of
you
hold
your
tongues
about
my
niece
and
she
will
hold
her
tongue
about
you
and
as
for
gibson
anybody
who
wants
him
after
this
is
welcome
to
him
for
us
french
young
ladies
and
so
she
stalked
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
and
walked
back
to
her
house
in
the
close
mamma
said
arabella
as
soon
as
the
enemy
was
gone
i
have
got
such
a
headache
that
i
think
i
will
go
and
i
will
go
with
you
dear
said
camilla
gibson
before
he
left
the
house
confided
his
secret
to
the
maternal
ears
of
french
he
certainly
had
been
allured
into
making
an
offer
to
dorothy
stanbury
but
was
ready
to
atone
for
this
crime
by
marrying
her
daughter
camilla
as
soon
as
might
be
convenient
he
was
certainly
driven
to
make
this
declaration
by
intense
cowardice
not
to
excuse
himself
for
in
that
there
could
be
no
excuse
but
how
else
should
he
dare
to
suggest
that
he
might
as
well
leave
the
house
shall
i
tell
the
dear
girl
asked
french
but
gibson
requested
a
fortnight
in
which
to
consider
how
the
proposition
had
best
be
made
chapter
xlix
brooke
burgess
after
supper
brooke
burgess
was
a
clerk
in
the
office
of
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
in
london
and
as
such
had
to
do
with
things
very
solemn
grave
and
almost
melancholy
he
had
to
deal
with
the
rents
of
episcopal
properties
to
correspond
with
clerical
claimants
and
to
be
at
home
with
the
circumstances
of
underpaid
vicars
and
perpetual
curates
with
much
less
than
but
yet
he
was
as
jolly
and
pleasant
at
his
desk
as
though
he
were
busied
about
the
collection
of
the
malt
tax
or
wrote
his
letters
to
admirals
and
captains
instead
of
to
deans
and
prebendaries
brooke
burgess
had
risen
to
be
a
senior
clerk
and
was
held
in
some
respect
in
his
office
but
it
was
not
perhaps
for
the
amount
of
work
he
did
nor
yet
on
account
of
the
gravity
of
his
demeanour
nor
for
the
brilliancy
of
his
intellect
but
if
not
clever
he
was
sensible
though
he
was
not
a
dragon
of
official
virtue
he
had
a
conscience
and
he
possessed
those
small
but
most
valuable
gifts
by
which
a
man
becomes
popular
among
men
and
thus
it
had
come
to
pass
in
all
those
battles
as
to
competitive
merit
which
had
taken
place
in
his
as
in
other
public
offices
that
no
one
had
ever
dreamed
of
putting
a
junior
over
the
head
of
brooke
burgess
he
was
tractable
easy
pleasant
and
therefore
deservedly
successful
all
his
brother
clerks
called
him
brooke
except
the
young
lads
who
for
the
first
year
or
two
of
their
service
still
denominated
him
burgess
brooke
said
one
of
his
juniors
coming
into
his
room
and
standing
before
the
fireplace
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
have
you
heard
who
is
to
be
the
new
commissioner
colenso
to
be
sure
said
brooke
what
a
lark
that
would
be
and
i
do
see
why
he
should
but
it
is
colenso
the
name
has
just
come
down
and
who
is
it
old
proudie
from
barchester
why
we
had
him
here
years
ago
and
he
resigned
but
he
to
come
on
again
now
for
a
spell
it
always
seems
to
me
that
the
bishops
ai
a
bit
of
use
here
they
only
get
blown
up
and
snubbed
and
shoved
into
corners
by
the
others
you
young
reprobate
to
talk
of
shoving
an
archbishop
into
a
corner
well
do
they
it
only
for
the
name
of
it
they
have
them
there
the
bishop
of
broomsgrove
he
always
sauntering
about
the
place
looking
as
though
he
be
so
much
obliged
if
somebody
would
give
him
something
to
do
he
always
smiling
and
so
gracious
just
as
if
he
did
feel
above
half
sure
that
he
had
any
right
to
be
where
he
is
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
somebody
was
going
to
kick
him
and
so
old
proudie
is
coming
up
again
said
brooke
it
certainly
is
very
much
the
same
to
us
whom
they
send
he
get
shoved
into
a
corner
as
you
call
it
only
that
he
go
into
the
corner
without
any
shoving
then
there
came
in
a
messenger
with
a
card
and
brooke
learned
that
hugh
stanbury
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
room
in
performing
the
promise
made
to
dorothy
he
had
called
upon
her
brother
as
soon
as
he
was
back
in
london
but
had
not
found
him
this
now
was
the
return
visit
i
thought
i
was
sure
to
find
you
here
said
hugh
pretty
nearly
sure
from
eleven
till
five
said
brooke
a
hard
stepmother
like
the
civil
service
does
not
allow
one
much
chance
of
relief
i
do
get
across
to
the
club
sometimes
for
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
but
here
i
am
now
at
any
rate
and
i
very
glad
you
have
come
then
there
was
some
talk
between
them
about
affairs
at
exeter
but
as
they
were
interrupted
before
half
an
hour
was
over
their
heads
by
a
summons
brought
for
burgess
from
one
of
the
secretaries
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
dine
together
at
burgess
club
on
the
following
day
we
can
manage
a
pretty
good
said
brooke
and
have
a
fair
glass
of
sherry
i
think
you
can
get
much
more
than
that
anywhere
nowadays
unless
you
want
a
dinner
for
eight
at
three
guineas
a
head
the
magnificence
of
men
has
become
so
intolerable
now
that
one
is
driven
to
be
humble
in
one
stanbury
assured
his
acquaintance
that
he
was
anything
but
magnificent
in
his
own
ideas
that
cold
beef
and
beer
was
his
usual
fare
and
at
last
allowed
the
clerk
to
wait
upon
the
secretary
i
would
have
any
other
fellow
to
meet
you
said
brooke
as
they
sat
at
their
dinners
because
in
this
way
we
can
talk
over
the
dear
old
woman
at
exeter
yes
our
fellow
does
make
good
soup
and
about
all
that
he
does
do
well
as
for
getting
a
potato
properly
boiled
that
quite
out
of
the
question
yes
it
is
a
good
glass
of
sherry
i
told
you
we
a
fairish
tap
of
sherry
on
well
i
was
there
backwards
and
forwards
for
nearly
six
weeks
and
how
did
you
get
on
with
the
old
woman
like
a
house
on
fire
said
brooke
she
did
quarrel
with
you
no
upon
the
whole
she
did
not
i
always
felt
that
it
was
touch
and
go
she
might
or
she
might
not
every
now
and
then
she
looked
at
me
and
said
a
sharp
word
as
though
it
was
about
to
come
but
i
had
determined
when
i
went
there
altogether
to
disregard
that
kind
of
thing
it
rather
important
to
you
is
it
not
you
mean
about
her
money
of
course
i
mean
about
her
money
said
stanbury
it
is
important
and
so
it
was
to
you
not
in
the
same
degree
or
nearly
so
and
as
for
me
it
was
not
on
the
cards
that
we
should
quarrel
i
am
so
utterly
a
bohemian
in
all
my
ideas
of
life
and
she
is
so
absolutely
the
reverse
that
not
to
have
quarrelled
would
have
been
hypocritical
on
my
part
or
on
hers
she
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
she
had
a
right
to
rule
my
life
and
of
course
she
quarrelled
with
me
when
i
made
her
understand
that
she
should
do
nothing
of
the
kind
now
she
want
to
rule
you
i
hope
not
she
has
taken
you
up
continued
stanbury
on
altogether
a
different
understanding
you
are
to
her
the
representative
of
a
family
to
whom
she
thinks
she
owes
the
restitution
of
the
property
which
she
enjoys
i
was
simply
a
member
of
her
own
family
to
which
she
owes
nothing
she
thought
it
well
to
help
one
of
us
out
of
what
she
regarded
as
her
private
purse
and
she
chose
me
but
the
matter
is
quite
different
with
you
she
might
have
given
everything
to
you
as
well
as
to
me
said
brooke
that
not
her
idea
she
conceives
herself
bound
to
leave
all
she
has
back
to
a
burgess
except
anything
she
may
save
as
she
says
off
her
own
back
or
out
of
her
own
belly
she
has
told
me
so
a
score
of
times
and
what
did
you
say
i
always
told
her
that
let
her
do
as
she
would
i
should
never
ask
any
question
about
her
will
but
she
hates
us
all
like
poison
except
me
said
brooke
i
never
knew
people
so
absurdly
hostile
as
are
your
aunt
and
my
uncle
barty
each
thinks
the
other
the
most
wicked
person
in
the
world
i
suppose
your
uncle
was
hard
upon
her
once
very
likely
he
is
a
hard
man
and
has
very
warmly
all
the
feelings
of
an
injured
man
i
suppose
my
uncle
brooke
will
was
a
cruel
blow
to
him
he
professes
to
believe
that
miss
stanbury
will
never
leave
me
a
shilling
he
is
wrong
then
said
stanbury
oh
yes
he
wrong
because
he
thinks
that
that
her
present
intention
i
do
know
that
he
wrong
as
to
the
probable
result
who
will
have
it
then
there
are
ever
so
many
horses
in
the
race
said
brooke
i
one
you
the
favourite
said
stanbury
for
the
moment
i
am
then
there
yourself
i
been
scratched
and
am
altogether
out
of
the
betting
and
your
sister
continued
brooke
she
only
entered
to
run
for
the
second
money
and
if
she
trot
over
the
course
quietly
and
not
go
the
wrong
side
of
the
posts
she
win
that
she
may
do
more
than
that
then
there
martha
my
aunt
will
never
leave
her
money
to
a
servant
what
she
may
give
to
martha
would
come
from
her
own
savings
the
next
is
a
dark
horse
but
one
that
wins
a
good
many
races
of
this
kind
he
apt
to
come
in
with
a
fatal
rush
at
the
end
who
is
it
the
hospitals
when
an
old
lady
finds
in
her
latter
days
that
she
hates
everybody
and
fancies
that
the
people
around
her
are
all
thinking
of
her
money
she
uncommon
likely
to
indulge
herself
in
a
little
bit
of
revenge
and
solace
herself
with
charity
but
she
so
good
a
woman
at
heart
said
hugh
and
what
can
a
good
woman
do
better
than
promote
hospitals
she
never
do
that
she
too
strong
it
a
maudlin
sort
of
thing
after
all
for
a
person
to
leave
everything
to
a
hospital
but
people
are
maudlin
when
they
dying
said
brooke
or
even
when
they
think
they
dying
how
else
did
the
church
get
the
estates
of
which
we
are
now
distributing
so
bountifully
some
of
the
last
remnants
down
at
our
office
come
into
the
next
room
and
have
a
smoke
they
had
their
smoke
and
then
they
went
at
to
the
play
and
after
the
play
was
over
they
eat
three
or
four
dozen
of
oysters
between
them
brooke
burgess
was
a
little
too
old
for
oysters
at
midnight
in
september
but
he
went
through
his
work
like
a
man
hugh
stanbury
powers
were
so
great
that
he
could
have
got
up
and
done
the
same
thing
again
after
he
had
been
an
hour
in
bed
without
any
serious
inconvenience
but
in
truth
brooke
burgess
had
still
another
word
or
two
to
say
before
he
went
to
his
rest
they
supped
somewhere
near
the
haymarket
and
then
he
offered
to
walk
home
with
stanbury
to
his
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
do
you
know
that
gibson
at
exeter
he
asked
as
they
passed
through
leicester
square
yes
i
knew
him
he
was
a
sort
of
parson
at
my
house
in
my
days
exactly
but
i
fancy
that
has
come
to
an
end
now
have
you
heard
anything
about
him
lately
well
yes
i
have
said
stanbury
feeling
that
dislike
to
speak
of
his
sister
which
is
common
to
most
brothers
when
in
company
with
other
men
i
suppose
you
heard
of
it
and
as
i
was
in
the
middle
of
it
all
of
course
i
could
but
know
all
about
it
too
your
aunt
wanted
him
to
marry
your
sister
so
i
was
told
but
your
sister
did
see
it
said
brooke
so
i
understand
said
stanbury
i
believe
my
aunt
was
exceedingly
liberal
and
meant
to
do
the
best
she
could
for
poor
dorothy
but
if
she
did
like
him
i
suppose
she
was
right
not
to
have
him
said
hugh
of
course
she
was
right
said
brooke
with
a
good
deal
of
enthusiasm
i
believe
gibson
to
be
a
very
decent
sort
of
fellow
said
stanbury
a
mean
paltry
dog
said
brooke
there
had
been
a
little
after
the
oysters
and
burgess
was
perhaps
moved
to
a
warmer
expression
of
feeling
than
he
might
have
displayed
had
he
discussed
this
branch
of
the
subject
before
supper
i
knew
from
the
first
that
she
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
he
is
such
a
poor
creature
i
always
thought
well
of
him
said
stanbury
and
was
inclined
to
think
that
dolly
might
have
done
worse
it
is
hard
to
say
what
is
the
worst
a
girl
might
do
but
i
think
she
might
do
perhaps
a
little
better
what
do
you
mean
said
hugh
i
think
i
shall
go
down
and
ask
her
to
take
myself
do
you
mean
it
in
earnest
i
do
said
brooke
of
course
i
had
a
chance
when
i
was
there
she
told
me
who
told
you
dorothy
no
your
aunt
she
told
me
that
gibson
was
to
marry
your
sister
you
know
your
aunt
way
she
spoke
of
it
as
though
the
thing
were
settled
as
soon
as
she
had
got
it
into
her
own
head
and
she
was
as
hot
upon
it
as
though
gibson
had
been
an
archbishop
i
had
nothing
to
do
then
but
to
wait
and
see
i
had
no
idea
of
dolly
being
fought
for
by
rivals
brothers
never
think
much
of
their
sisters
said
brooke
burgess
i
can
assure
you
i
think
a
great
deal
of
dorothy
said
hugh
i
believe
her
to
be
as
sweet
a
woman
as
god
ever
made
she
hardly
knows
that
she
has
a
self
belonging
to
herself
i
am
sure
she
does
said
brooke
she
is
a
dear
loving
creature
who
is
only
too
ready
to
yield
in
all
things
but
she
would
yield
about
gibson
said
brooke
how
did
she
and
my
aunt
manage
your
sister
simply
said
she
could
and
then
that
she
would
i
never
thought
from
the
first
moment
that
she
take
that
fellow
in
the
first
place
he
ca
say
boo
to
a
goose
but
dolly
would
want
a
man
to
say
boo
i
not
so
sure
of
that
old
fellow
at
any
rate
i
mean
to
try
myself
now
what
the
old
woman
say
she
be
pleased
as
punch
i
should
think
said
stanbury
either
that
or
else
she
swear
that
she
never
speak
another
word
to
either
of
us
however
i
shall
go
on
with
it
does
dorothy
know
anything
of
this
asked
stanbury
not
a
word
said
brooke
i
came
away
a
day
or
so
after
gibson
was
settled
and
as
i
had
been
talked
to
all
through
the
affair
by
both
of
them
i
could
turn
round
and
offer
myself
the
moment
he
was
gone
you
wo
object
will
you
who
i
said
stanbury
i
shall
have
no
objection
as
long
as
dolly
pleases
herself
of
course
you
know
that
we
have
as
much
as
a
brass
farthing
among
us
that
wo
matter
if
the
old
lady
takes
it
kindly
said
brooke
then
they
parted
at
the
corner
of
lincoln
inn
fields
and
hugh
as
he
went
up
to
his
own
rooms
reflected
with
something
of
wonderment
on
the
success
of
dorothy
charms
she
had
always
been
the
poor
one
of
the
family
the
chick
out
of
the
nest
which
would
most
require
assistance
from
the
stronger
birds
but
it
now
appeared
that
she
would
become
the
first
among
all
the
stanburys
wealth
had
first
flowed
down
upon
the
stanbury
family
from
the
will
of
old
brooke
burgess
and
it
now
seemed
probable
that
poor
dolly
would
ultimately
have
the
enjoyment
of
it
all
chapter
camilla
triumphant
illustration
it
was
now
new
year
day
and
there
was
some
grief
and
perhaps
more
excitement
in
exeter
for
it
was
rumoured
that
miss
stanbury
lay
very
ill
at
her
house
in
the
close
but
in
order
that
our
somewhat
uneven
story
may
run
as
smoothly
as
it
may
be
made
to
do
the
little
history
of
the
french
family
for
the
intervening
months
shall
be
told
in
this
chapter
in
order
that
it
may
be
understood
how
matters
were
with
them
when
the
tidings
of
miss
stanbury
severe
illness
first
reached
their
house
at
heavitree
after
that
terrible
scene
in
which
miss
stanbury
had
so
dreadfully
confounded
gibson
by
declaring
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
rebuffed
by
dorothy
the
unfortunate
clergyman
had
endeavoured
to
make
his
peace
with
the
french
family
by
assuring
the
mother
that
in
very
truth
it
was
the
dearest
wish
of
his
heart
to
make
her
daughter
camilla
his
wife
french
who
had
ever
been
disposed
to
favour
arabella
ambition
well
knowing
its
priority
and
ancient
right
and
who
of
late
had
been
taught
to
consider
that
even
camilla
had
consented
to
waive
any
claim
that
she
might
have
once
possessed
could
not
refrain
from
the
expression
of
some
surprise
that
he
should
be
recovered
at
all
out
of
the
stanbury
clutches
was
very
much
to
french
was
so
much
that
had
time
been
given
her
for
consideration
she
would
have
acknowledged
to
herself
readily
that
the
property
had
best
be
secured
at
once
to
the
family
without
incurring
that
amount
of
risk
which
must
unquestionably
attend
any
attempt
on
her
part
to
direct
gibson
purpose
hither
or
thither
but
the
proposition
came
so
suddenly
that
time
was
not
allowed
to
her
to
be
altogether
wise
i
thought
it
was
poor
bella
she
said
with
something
of
a
piteous
whine
in
her
voice
at
the
moment
gibson
was
so
humble
that
he
was
half
inclined
to
give
way
even
on
that
head
he
felt
himself
to
have
been
brought
so
low
in
the
market
by
that
terrible
story
of
miss
stanbury
which
he
had
been
unable
either
to
contradict
or
to
explain
that
there
was
but
little
power
of
fighting
left
in
him
he
was
however
just
able
to
speak
a
word
for
himself
and
that
sufficed
i
hope
there
has
been
no
mistake
he
said
but
really
it
is
camilla
that
has
my
heart
french
made
no
rejoinder
to
this
it
was
so
much
to
her
to
know
that
gibson
heart
was
among
them
at
all
after
what
had
occurred
in
the
close
that
she
acknowledged
to
herself
after
that
moment
of
reflection
that
arabella
must
be
sacrificed
for
the
good
of
the
family
interests
poor
dear
loving
misguided
and
spiritless
mother
she
would
have
given
the
blood
out
of
her
bosom
to
get
husbands
for
her
daughters
though
it
was
not
of
her
own
experience
that
she
had
learned
that
of
all
worldly
goods
a
husband
is
the
best
but
it
was
the
possession
which
they
had
from
their
earliest
years
thought
of
acquiring
which
they
first
expected
for
which
they
had
then
hoped
and
afterwards
worked
and
schemed
and
striven
with
every
energy
and
as
to
which
they
had
at
last
almost
despaired
and
now
arabella
fire
had
been
rekindled
with
a
new
spark
which
alas
was
to
be
quenched
so
suddenly
and
am
i
to
tell
them
asked
french
with
a
tremor
in
her
voice
to
this
however
gibson
demurred
he
said
that
for
certain
reasons
he
should
like
a
fortnight
grace
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
he
would
be
prepared
to
speak
the
interval
was
granted
without
further
questions
and
gibson
was
allowed
to
leave
the
house
after
that
french
was
not
very
comfortable
at
home
as
soon
as
gibson
had
departed
camilla
at
once
returned
to
her
mother
and
desired
to
know
what
had
taken
place
was
it
true
that
the
perjured
man
had
proposed
to
that
young
woman
in
the
close
french
was
not
clever
at
keeping
a
secret
and
she
could
not
keep
this
by
her
own
aid
she
told
all
that
happened
to
camilla
and
between
them
they
agreed
that
arabella
should
be
kept
in
ignorance
till
the
fatal
fortnight
should
have
passed
when
camilla
was
interrogated
as
to
her
own
purpose
she
said
she
should
like
a
day
to
think
of
it
she
took
the
hours
and
then
made
the
following
confession
of
her
passion
to
her
mother
you
see
mamma
i
always
liked
mr
gibson
always
so
did
arabella
my
dear
before
you
thought
of
such
things
i
dare
say
that
may
be
true
mamma
but
that
is
not
my
fault
he
came
here
among
us
on
such
sweetly
intimate
terms
that
the
feeling
grew
up
with
me
before
i
knew
what
it
meant
as
to
any
idea
of
cutting
out
arabella
my
conscience
is
quite
clear
if
i
thought
there
had
been
anything
really
between
them
i
would
have
gone
anywhere
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
rather
than
rob
my
sister
of
a
heart
that
belonged
to
her
he
has
been
so
slow
about
it
said
french
i
do
know
about
that
said
camilla
gentlemen
have
to
be
slow
i
suppose
when
they
think
of
their
incomes
he
only
got
three
years
ago
and
did
know
for
the
first
year
whether
he
could
hold
that
and
the
minor
canonry
together
of
course
a
gentleman
has
to
think
of
these
things
before
he
comes
forward
my
dear
he
has
been
very
backward
if
i
to
be
gibson
mamma
i
beg
that
i
may
hear
anything
said
against
him
then
there
came
all
this
about
that
young
woman
and
when
i
saw
that
arabella
took
on
so
which
i
must
say
was
very
absurd
i
sure
i
put
myself
out
of
the
way
entirely
if
i
buried
myself
under
the
ground
i
could
have
done
it
more
and
it
my
belief
that
what
i
said
all
for
arabella
sake
has
put
the
old
woman
into
such
a
rage
that
it
has
made
a
quarrel
between
him
and
the
niece
otherwise
that
would
be
off
i
do
believe
a
word
of
her
refusing
him
and
never
shall
is
it
in
the
course
of
things
mamma
french
shook
her
head
of
course
not
then
when
you
question
him
very
properly
he
says
that
he
devoted
to
poor
me
if
i
was
to
refuse
him
he
would
put
up
with
bella
i
suppose
not
said
french
he
hates
bella
i
known
it
all
along
though
i
would
say
so
if
i
were
to
sacrifice
myself
ever
so
it
would
be
of
any
good
and
i
sha
do
it
in
this
way
the
matter
was
arranged
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
however
gibson
did
not
come
nor
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
inquiries
had
of
course
been
made
and
it
was
ascertained
that
he
had
gone
into
cornwall
for
a
parson
holiday
of
thirteen
days
that
might
be
all
very
well
a
man
might
want
the
recruiting
vigour
of
some
change
of
air
after
such
scenes
as
those
gibson
had
gone
through
with
the
stanburys
and
before
his
proposed
encounter
with
new
perils
and
he
was
a
man
so
tied
by
the
leg
that
his
escape
could
not
be
for
any
long
time
he
was
back
on
the
appointed
sunday
and
on
the
wednesday
french
under
camilla
instruction
wrote
to
him
a
pretty
little
note
he
replied
that
he
would
be
with
her
on
the
saturday
it
would
then
be
nearly
four
weeks
after
the
great
day
with
miss
stanbury
but
no
one
would
be
inclined
to
quarrel
with
so
short
a
delay
as
that
arabella
in
the
meantime
had
become
fidgety
and
unhappy
she
seemed
to
understand
that
something
was
expected
being
quite
unable
to
guess
what
that
something
might
be
she
was
true
throughout
these
days
to
the
simplicity
of
which
gibson
had
recommended
to
her
and
seemed
in
her
questions
to
her
mother
and
to
camilla
to
be
more
fearful
of
dorothy
stanbury
than
of
any
other
enemy
mamma
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
her
said
camilla
more
than
once
but
she
had
not
been
told
when
gibson
came
on
the
saturday
it
may
truly
be
said
that
the
poor
mother
pleasure
in
the
prospects
of
one
daughter
was
altogether
destroyed
by
the
anticipation
of
the
other
misery
had
gibson
made
dorothy
stanbury
his
wife
they
could
have
all
comforted
themselves
together
by
the
heat
of
their
joint
animosity
he
came
on
the
saturday
and
it
was
so
managed
that
he
was
closeted
with
camilla
before
arabella
knew
that
he
was
in
the
house
there
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
his
work
was
easy
and
perhaps
pleasant
when
he
began
to
explain
his
intention
camilla
with
the
utmost
frankness
informed
him
that
her
mother
had
told
her
all
about
it
then
she
turned
her
face
on
one
side
and
put
her
hand
in
his
he
got
his
arm
round
her
waist
gave
her
a
kiss
and
the
thing
was
done
camilla
was
fully
resolved
that
after
such
a
betrothal
it
should
not
be
undone
she
had
behaved
with
sisterly
forbearance
and
would
not
now
lose
the
reward
of
virtue
not
a
word
was
said
of
arabella
at
this
interview
till
he
was
pressed
to
come
and
drink
tea
with
them
all
that
night
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
camilla
declared
with
something
perhaps
of
imperious
roughness
in
her
manner
that
he
had
better
face
it
all
at
once
mamma
will
tell
her
and
she
will
understand
said
camilla
he
hesitated
again
but
at
last
promised
that
he
would
come
whilst
he
was
yet
in
the
house
french
had
told
the
whole
story
to
her
poor
elder
daughter
what
is
he
doing
with
camilla
arabella
had
asked
with
feverish
excitement
bella
darling
do
you
know
said
the
mother
i
know
nothing
everybody
keeps
me
in
the
dark
and
i
am
badly
used
what
is
it
that
he
is
doing
then
french
tried
to
take
the
poor
young
woman
in
her
arms
but
arabella
would
not
submit
to
be
embraced
do
she
exclaimed
leave
me
alone
nobody
likes
me
or
cares
a
bit
about
me
why
is
cammy
with
him
there
all
alone
i
suppose
he
is
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
then
arabella
threw
herself
in
despair
upon
the
bed
and
wept
without
any
further
attempt
at
control
over
her
feelings
it
was
a
to
her
last
hope
and
all
the
world
as
she
looked
upon
the
world
then
was
over
for
her
if
i
could
have
arranged
it
the
other
way
you
know
that
i
would
said
the
mother
mamma
said
arabella
jumping
up
he
sha
do
it
he
has
a
right
and
as
for
her
oh
that
she
should
treat
me
in
this
way
did
he
tell
me
the
other
night
when
he
drank
tea
here
with
me
alone
what
did
he
tell
you
bella
never
mind
nothing
shall
ever
make
me
speak
to
him
again
not
if
he
married
her
three
times
over
nor
to
her
she
is
a
nasty
sly
thing
but
bella
do
talk
to
me
mamma
there
never
was
such
a
thing
done
before
since
people
were
people
at
all
she
has
been
doing
it
all
the
time
i
know
she
has
nevertheless
arabella
did
sit
down
to
tea
with
the
two
lovers
that
night
there
was
a
terrible
scene
between
her
and
camilla
but
camilla
held
her
own
and
arabella
being
the
weaker
of
the
two
was
vanquished
by
the
expenditure
of
her
own
small
energies
camilla
argued
that
as
her
sister
chance
was
gone
and
as
the
prize
had
come
in
her
own
way
there
was
no
good
reason
why
it
should
be
lost
to
the
family
altogether
because
arabella
could
not
win
it
when
arabella
called
her
a
treacherous
vixen
and
a
heartless
profligate
hussy
she
spoke
out
freely
and
said
that
she
was
going
to
be
abused
a
gentleman
to
whom
she
was
attached
had
asked
her
for
her
hand
and
she
had
given
it
if
arabella
chose
to
make
herself
a
fool
she
might
but
what
would
be
the
effect
simply
that
all
the
world
would
know
that
she
arabella
was
disappointed
poor
bella
at
last
gave
way
put
on
her
discarded
chignon
and
came
down
to
tea
gibson
was
already
in
the
room
when
she
entered
it
arabella
he
said
getting
up
to
greet
her
i
hope
you
will
congratulate
me
he
had
planned
his
little
speech
and
his
manner
of
making
it
and
had
wisely
decided
that
in
this
way
might
he
best
get
over
the
difficulty
oh
yes
of
course
she
said
with
a
little
giggle
and
then
a
sob
and
then
a
flood
of
tears
dear
bella
feels
these
things
so
strongly
said
french
we
have
never
been
parted
yet
said
camilla
then
arabella
tapped
the
head
of
the
sofa
three
or
four
times
sharply
with
her
knuckles
it
was
the
only
protest
against
the
reading
of
the
scene
which
camilla
had
given
of
which
she
was
capable
at
that
moment
after
that
french
gave
out
the
tea
arabella
curled
herself
upon
the
sofa
as
though
she
were
asleep
and
the
two
lovers
settled
down
to
proper
conversation
the
reader
may
be
sure
that
camilla
was
not
slow
in
making
the
fact
of
her
engagement
notorious
through
the
city
it
was
not
probably
true
that
the
tidings
of
her
success
had
anything
to
do
with
miss
stanbury
illness
but
it
was
reported
by
many
that
such
was
the
case
it
was
in
november
that
the
arrangement
was
made
and
it
certainly
was
true
that
miss
stanbury
was
rather
ill
about
the
same
time
you
know
you
naughty
lothario
that
you
did
give
her
some
ground
to
hope
that
she
might
dispose
of
her
unfortunate
niece
said
camilla
playfully
to
her
own
one
when
this
illness
was
discussed
between
them
but
you
are
caught
now
and
your
wings
are
clipped
and
you
are
never
to
be
a
naughty
lothario
again
the
clerical
don
juan
bore
it
all
awkwardly
indeed
but
with
good
humour
and
declared
that
all
his
troubles
of
that
sort
were
over
now
and
for
ever
nevertheless
he
did
not
name
the
day
and
camilla
began
to
feel
that
there
might
be
occasion
for
a
little
more
of
that
imperious
roughness
which
she
had
at
her
command
november
was
nearly
over
and
nothing
had
been
fixed
about
the
day
arabella
never
condescended
to
speak
to
her
sister
on
the
subject
but
on
more
than
one
occasion
made
some
inquiry
of
her
mother
and
she
came
to
perceive
or
to
think
that
she
perceived
that
her
mother
was
still
anxious
on
the
subject
i
should
wonder
if
he
off
some
day
now
she
said
at
last
to
her
mother
do
say
anything
so
dreadful
bella
it
would
serve
cammy
quite
right
and
it
just
what
he
likely
to
do
it
would
kill
me
said
the
mother
i
do
know
about
killing
said
arabella
it
nothing
to
what
i
had
to
go
through
i
should
pretend
to
be
sorry
if
he
were
to
go
to
but
gibson
had
no
idea
of
going
to
he
was
simply
carrying
out
his
little
scheme
for
securing
the
advantages
of
a
long
day
he
was
fully
resolved
to
be
married
and
was
contented
to
think
that
his
engagement
was
the
best
thing
for
him
to
one
or
two
male
friends
he
spoke
of
camilla
as
the
perfection
of
female
virtue
and
entertained
no
smallest
idea
of
ultimate
escape
but
a
long
day
is
often
a
convenience
a
bill
at
three
months
sits
easier
on
a
man
than
one
at
sixty
days
and
a
bill
at
six
months
is
almost
as
little
of
a
burden
as
no
bill
at
all
but
camilla
was
resolved
that
some
day
should
be
fixed
thomas
she
said
to
her
lover
one
morning
as
they
were
walking
home
together
after
service
at
the
cathedral
is
this
rather
a
fool
paradise
of
ours
how
a
fool
paradise
asked
the
happy
thomas
what
i
mean
is
dearest
that
we
ought
to
fix
something
mamma
is
getting
uneasy
about
her
own
plans
in
what
way
dearest
about
a
thousand
things
she
ca
arrange
anything
till
our
plans
are
made
of
course
there
are
little
troubles
about
money
when
people
ai
rich
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
this
might
seem
to
be
a
plea
for
postponing
rather
than
for
hurrying
the
marriage
and
she
mended
her
argument
the
truth
is
thomas
she
wants
to
know
when
the
day
is
to
be
fixed
and
i
promised
to
ask
she
said
she
ask
you
herself
but
i
would
let
her
do
that
we
must
think
about
it
of
course
said
thomas
but
my
dear
there
has
been
plenty
of
time
for
thinking
what
do
you
say
to
january
this
was
on
the
last
day
of
november
january
exclaimed
thomas
in
a
tone
that
betrayed
no
triumph
i
could
get
my
services
arranged
for
in
january
i
thought
a
clergyman
could
always
manage
that
for
his
marriage
said
camilla
not
in
january
besides
i
was
thinking
you
would
like
to
be
away
in
warmer
weather
they
were
still
in
november
and
he
was
thinking
of
postponing
it
till
the
summer
camilla
immediately
perceived
how
necessary
it
was
that
she
should
be
plain
with
him
we
shall
not
have
warm
weather
as
you
call
it
for
a
very
long
time
thomas
and
i
do
think
that
it
would
be
wise
to
wait
for
the
weather
at
all
indeed
i
begun
to
get
my
things
for
doing
it
in
the
winter
mamma
said
that
she
was
sure
january
would
be
the
very
latest
and
it
is
as
though
we
had
to
get
furniture
or
anything
of
that
kind
of
course
a
lady
be
pressing
she
smiled
sweetly
and
leaned
on
his
arm
as
she
said
this
but
i
hate
all
girlish
nonsense
and
that
kind
of
thing
it
is
such
a
bore
to
be
kept
waiting
i
sure
there
nothing
to
prevent
it
coming
off
in
february
the
of
march
was
fixed
before
they
reached
heavitree
and
camilla
went
into
her
mother
house
a
happy
woman
but
gibson
as
he
went
home
thought
that
he
had
been
hardly
used
here
was
a
girl
who
had
a
shilling
of
money
not
a
shilling
till
her
mother
died
and
who
already
talked
about
his
house
and
his
furniture
and
his
income
as
if
it
were
all
her
own
circumstanced
as
she
was
what
right
had
she
to
press
for
an
early
day
he
was
quite
sure
that
arabella
would
have
been
more
discreet
and
less
exacting
he
was
very
angry
with
his
dear
cammy
as
he
went
across
the
close
to
his
house
chapter
li
shewing
what
happened
during
miss
stanbury
illness
it
was
on
that
sir
peter
mancrudy
the
highest
authority
on
such
matters
in
the
west
of
england
was
sent
for
to
see
miss
stanbury
and
sir
peter
had
acknowledged
that
things
were
very
serious
he
took
dorothy
on
one
side
and
told
her
that
martin
the
ordinary
practitioner
had
treated
the
case
no
doubt
quite
wisely
throughout
that
there
was
not
a
word
to
be
said
against
martin
whose
experience
was
great
and
whose
discretion
was
undeniable
but
nevertheless
at
least
it
seemed
to
dorothy
that
this
was
the
only
meaning
to
be
attributed
to
sir
peter
words
martin
had
in
this
case
taken
one
line
of
treatment
when
he
ought
to
have
taken
another
the
plan
of
action
was
undoubtedly
changed
and
martin
became
very
fidgety
and
ordered
nothing
without
sir
peter
sanction
miss
stanbury
was
suffering
from
bronchitis
and
a
complication
of
diseases
about
her
throat
and
chest
barty
burgess
declared
to
more
than
one
acquaintance
in
the
little
parlour
behind
the
bank
that
she
would
go
on
drinking
four
or
five
glasses
of
new
port
wine
every
day
in
direct
opposition
to
martin
request
camilla
french
heard
the
report
and
repeated
it
to
her
lover
and
perhaps
another
person
or
two
with
an
expression
of
her
assured
conviction
that
it
must
be
false
at
any
rate
as
regarded
the
fifth
glass
machugh
who
saw
martha
daily
was
much
frightened
the
peril
of
such
a
friend
disturbed
equally
the
repose
and
the
pleasures
of
her
life
clifford
was
often
at
miss
and
would
have
sat
there
reading
for
hours
together
had
she
not
been
made
to
understand
by
martha
that
miss
stanbury
preferred
that
miss
dorothy
should
read
to
her
the
sick
woman
received
the
sacrament
weekly
not
from
gibson
but
from
the
hands
of
another
minor
canon
and
though
she
never
would
admit
her
own
danger
or
allow
others
to
talk
to
her
of
it
it
was
known
to
them
all
that
she
admitted
it
to
herself
because
she
had
with
much
personal
annoyance
caused
a
codicil
to
be
added
to
her
will
as
you
did
marry
that
man
she
said
to
dorothy
i
must
change
it
again
it
was
in
vain
that
dorothy
begged
her
not
to
trouble
herself
with
such
thoughts
that
trash
said
miss
stanbury
angrily
a
person
who
has
it
is
bound
to
trouble
himself
about
it
you
suppose
i
afraid
of
dying
do
you
she
added
dorothy
answered
her
with
some
commonplace
declaring
how
strongly
they
all
expected
to
see
her
as
well
as
ever
i
not
a
bit
afraid
to
die
said
the
old
woman
wheezing
struggling
with
such
voice
as
she
possessed
i
not
afraid
of
it
and
i
do
think
i
shall
die
this
time
but
i
not
going
to
have
mistakes
when
i
gone
this
was
on
the
eve
of
the
new
year
and
on
the
same
night
she
asked
dorothy
to
write
to
brooke
burgess
and
request
him
to
come
to
exeter
this
was
letter
exeter
december
my
dear
burgess
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
written
before
to
say
that
aunt
stanbury
is
not
as
well
as
we
could
wish
her
but
as
i
know
that
you
can
not
very
well
leave
your
office
i
have
thought
it
best
not
to
say
anything
to
frighten
you
but
aunt
herself
has
desired
me
to
tell
you
that
she
thinks
you
ought
to
know
that
she
is
ill
and
that
she
wishes
you
to
come
to
exeter
for
a
day
or
two
if
it
is
possible
sir
peter
mancrudy
has
been
here
every
day
since
and
i
believe
he
thinks
she
may
get
over
it
it
is
chiefly
in
the
throat
what
they
call
bronchitis
and
she
has
got
to
be
very
weak
with
it
and
at
the
same
time
very
liable
to
inflammation
so
i
know
that
you
will
come
if
you
can
yours
very
truly
dorothy
stanbury
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
she
had
her
lawyer
here
with
her
the
day
before
yesterday
but
she
does
not
seem
to
think
that
she
herself
is
in
danger
i
read
to
her
a
good
deal
and
i
think
she
is
generally
asleep
when
i
stop
she
wakes
and
i
do
believe
she
gets
any
other
rest
at
all
when
it
was
known
in
exeter
that
brooke
burgess
had
been
sent
for
then
the
opinion
became
general
that
miss
stanbury
days
were
numbered
questions
were
asked
of
sir
peter
at
every
corner
of
the
street
but
sir
peter
was
a
discreet
man
who
could
answer
such
questions
without
giving
any
information
if
it
so
pleased
god
his
patient
would
die
but
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
might
live
that
was
the
tenor
of
sir
peter
replies
and
they
were
read
in
any
light
according
to
the
idiosyncracies
of
the
reader
machugh
was
quite
sure
that
the
danger
was
over
and
had
a
little
game
of
cribbage
on
the
sly
with
old
miss
wright
for
during
the
severity
of
miss
stanbury
illness
whist
was
put
on
one
side
in
the
vicinity
of
the
close
barty
burgess
was
still
obdurate
and
shook
his
head
he
was
of
opinion
that
they
might
soon
gratify
their
curiosity
and
see
the
last
crowning
iniquity
of
this
wickedest
of
old
women
clifford
declared
that
it
was
all
in
the
hands
of
god
but
that
she
saw
no
reason
why
miss
stanbury
should
not
get
about
again
gibson
thought
that
it
was
all
up
with
his
late
friend
and
camilla
wished
that
at
their
last
interview
there
had
been
more
of
charity
on
the
part
of
one
whom
she
had
regarded
in
past
days
with
respect
and
esteem
french
despondent
about
everything
was
quite
despondent
in
this
case
martha
almost
despaired
and
already
was
burdened
with
the
cares
of
a
whole
wardrobe
of
solemn
funereal
clothing
she
was
seen
peering
in
for
at
the
windows
and
doorway
of
a
large
warehouse
for
the
sale
of
mourning
giles
hickbody
would
not
speak
above
his
breath
and
took
his
beer
standing
but
dorothy
was
hopeful
and
really
believed
that
her
aunt
would
recover
perhaps
sir
peter
had
spoken
to
her
in
terms
less
oracular
than
those
which
he
used
towards
the
public
brooke
burgess
came
and
had
an
interview
with
sir
peter
and
to
him
sir
peter
was
under
some
obligation
to
speak
plainly
as
being
the
person
whom
miss
stanbury
recognised
as
her
heir
so
sir
peter
declared
that
his
patient
might
perhaps
live
and
perhaps
might
die
the
truth
is
burgess
said
sir
peter
a
doctor
does
know
so
very
much
more
about
these
things
than
other
people
it
was
understood
that
brooke
was
to
remain
three
days
in
exeter
and
then
return
to
london
he
would
of
course
come
again
if
if
anything
should
happen
sir
peter
had
been
quite
clear
in
his
opinion
that
no
immediate
result
was
to
be
anticipated
either
in
the
one
direction
or
the
other
his
patient
was
doomed
to
a
long
illness
she
might
get
over
it
or
she
might
succumb
to
it
dorothy
and
brooke
were
thus
thrown
much
together
during
these
three
days
dorothy
indeed
spent
most
of
her
hours
beside
her
aunt
bed
instigating
sleep
by
the
reading
of
a
certain
series
of
sermons
in
which
miss
stanbury
had
great
faith
but
nevertheless
there
were
some
minutes
in
which
she
and
brooke
were
necessarily
together
they
eat
their
meals
in
each
other
company
and
there
was
a
period
in
the
evening
before
dorothy
began
her
in
her
aunt
room
at
which
she
took
her
tea
while
martha
was
nurse
in
the
room
above
at
this
time
of
the
day
she
would
remain
an
hour
or
more
with
brooke
and
a
great
deal
may
be
said
between
a
man
and
a
woman
in
an
hour
when
the
will
to
say
it
is
there
brooke
burgess
had
by
no
means
changed
his
mind
since
he
had
declared
it
to
hugh
stanbury
under
the
midnight
lamps
of
long
acre
when
warmed
by
the
influence
of
oysters
and
whisky
toddy
the
whisky
toddy
had
in
that
instance
brought
out
truth
and
not
falsehood
as
is
ever
the
nature
of
whisky
toddy
and
similar
dangerous
provocatives
there
is
no
saying
truer
than
that
which
declares
that
there
is
truth
in
wine
wine
is
a
dangerous
thing
and
should
not
be
made
the
exponent
of
truth
let
the
truth
be
good
as
it
may
but
it
has
the
merit
of
forcing
a
man
to
show
his
true
colours
a
man
who
is
a
gentleman
in
his
cups
may
be
trusted
to
be
a
gentleman
at
all
times
i
trust
that
the
severe
censor
will
not
turn
upon
me
and
tell
me
that
no
gentleman
in
these
days
is
ever
to
be
seen
in
his
cups
there
are
cups
of
different
degrees
of
depth
and
cups
do
exist
even
among
gentlemen
and
seem
disposed
to
hold
their
own
let
the
censor
be
ever
so
severe
the
gentleman
in
his
cups
is
a
gentleman
always
and
the
man
who
tells
his
friend
in
his
cups
that
he
is
in
love
does
so
because
the
fact
has
been
very
present
to
himself
in
his
cooler
and
calmer
moments
brooke
burgess
who
had
seen
hugh
stanbury
on
two
or
three
occasions
since
that
of
the
oysters
and
toddy
had
not
spoken
again
of
his
regard
for
sister
but
not
the
less
was
he
determined
to
carry
out
his
plan
and
make
dorothy
his
wife
if
she
would
accept
him
but
could
he
ask
her
while
the
old
lady
was
as
it
might
be
dying
in
the
house
he
put
this
question
to
himself
as
he
travelled
down
to
exeter
and
had
told
himself
that
he
must
be
guided
for
an
answer
by
circumstances
as
they
might
occur
hugh
had
met
him
at
the
station
as
he
started
for
exeter
and
there
had
been
a
consultation
between
them
as
to
the
propriety
of
bringing
about
or
of
attempting
to
bring
about
an
interview
between
hugh
and
his
aunt
do
whatever
you
like
hugh
had
said
i
would
go
down
to
her
at
a
moment
warning
if
she
should
express
a
desire
to
see
me
on
the
first
night
of
brooke
arrival
this
question
had
been
discussed
between
him
and
dorothy
dorothy
had
declared
herself
unable
to
give
advice
if
any
message
were
given
to
her
she
would
deliver
it
to
her
aunt
but
she
thought
that
anything
said
to
her
aunt
on
the
subject
had
better
come
from
brooke
himself
you
evidently
are
the
person
most
important
to
her
dorothy
said
and
she
would
listen
to
you
when
she
would
not
let
any
one
else
say
a
word
brooke
promised
that
he
would
think
of
it
and
then
dorothy
tripped
up
to
relieve
martha
dreaming
nothing
at
all
of
that
other
doubt
to
which
the
important
personage
downstairs
was
now
subject
dorothy
was
in
truth
very
fond
of
the
new
friend
she
had
made
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
be
a
possible
suitor
to
her
her
old
conception
of
herself
that
she
was
beneath
the
notice
of
any
man
had
only
been
partly
disturbed
by
the
absolute
fact
of
gibson
courtship
she
had
now
heard
of
his
engagement
with
camilla
french
and
saw
in
that
complete
proof
that
the
foolish
man
had
been
induced
to
offer
his
hand
to
her
by
the
promise
of
her
aunt
money
if
there
had
been
a
moment
of
exaltation
a
period
in
which
she
had
allowed
herself
to
think
that
she
was
as
other
women
capable
of
making
herself
dear
to
a
man
it
had
been
but
a
moment
and
now
she
rejoiced
greatly
that
she
had
not
acceded
to
the
wishes
of
one
to
whom
it
was
so
manifest
that
she
had
not
made
herself
in
the
least
dear
on
the
second
day
of
his
visit
brooke
was
summoned
to
miss
stanbury
room
at
noon
she
was
forbidden
to
talk
and
during
a
great
portion
of
the
day
could
hardly
speak
without
an
effort
but
there
would
be
half
hours
now
and
again
in
which
she
would
become
stronger
than
usual
at
which
time
nothing
that
martha
and
dorothy
could
say
would
induce
her
to
hold
her
tongue
when
brooke
came
to
her
on
this
occasion
he
found
her
sitting
up
in
bed
with
a
great
shawl
round
her
and
he
at
once
perceived
she
was
much
more
like
her
own
self
than
on
the
former
day
she
told
him
that
she
had
been
an
old
fool
for
sending
for
him
that
she
had
nothing
special
to
say
to
him
that
she
had
made
no
alteration
in
her
will
in
regard
to
him
except
that
i
have
done
something
for
dolly
that
will
have
to
come
out
of
your
pocket
brooke
brooke
declared
that
too
much
could
not
be
done
for
a
person
so
good
and
dear
and
excellent
as
dorothy
stanbury
let
it
come
out
of
whose
pocket
it
might
she
is
nothing
to
you
you
know
said
miss
stanbury
she
is
a
great
deal
to
me
said
brooke
what
is
she
asked
miss
stanbury
oh
a
friend
a
great
friend
well
yes
i
hope
it
may
be
so
but
she
wo
have
anything
that
i
have
saved
said
miss
stanbury
there
are
two
houses
at
thomas
but
i
bought
them
myself
brooke
out
of
the
income
brooke
could
only
declare
that
as
the
whole
property
was
hers
to
do
what
she
liked
with
it
as
completely
as
though
she
had
inherited
it
from
her
own
father
no
one
could
have
any
right
to
ask
questions
as
to
when
or
how
this
or
that
portion
of
the
property
had
accrued
but
i
do
think
i
going
to
die
yet
brooke
she
said
if
it
is
god
will
i
am
ready
not
that
i
fit
brooke
god
forbid
that
i
should
ever
think
that
but
i
doubt
whether
i
shall
ever
be
fitter
i
can
go
without
repining
if
he
thinks
best
to
take
me
then
he
stood
up
by
her
bedside
with
his
hand
upon
hers
and
after
some
hesitation
asked
her
whether
she
would
wish
to
see
her
nephew
hugh
no
said
she
sharply
brooke
went
on
to
say
how
pleased
hugh
would
have
been
to
come
to
her
i
do
think
much
of
reconciliations
said
the
old
woman
grimly
i
loved
him
dearly
but
he
did
love
me
and
i
do
know
what
good
we
should
do
each
other
brooke
declared
that
hugh
did
love
her
but
he
could
not
press
the
matter
and
it
was
dropped
on
that
evening
at
eight
dorothy
came
down
to
her
tea
she
had
dined
at
the
same
table
with
brooke
that
afternoon
but
a
servant
had
been
in
the
room
all
the
time
and
nothing
had
been
said
between
them
as
soon
as
brooke
had
got
his
tea
he
began
to
tell
the
story
of
his
failure
about
hugh
he
was
sorry
he
said
that
he
had
spoken
on
the
subject
as
it
had
moved
miss
stanbury
to
an
acrimony
which
he
had
not
expected
she
always
declares
that
he
never
loved
her
said
dorothy
she
has
told
me
so
twenty
times
there
are
people
who
fancy
that
nobody
cares
for
them
said
brooke
indeed
there
are
burgess
and
it
is
so
natural
why
natural
just
as
it
is
natural
that
there
should
be
dogs
and
cats
that
are
petted
and
loved
and
made
much
of
and
others
that
have
to
crawl
through
life
as
they
can
cuffed
and
kicked
and
starved
that
depends
on
the
accident
of
possession
said
brooke
so
does
the
other
how
many
people
there
are
that
do
seem
to
belong
to
anybody
and
if
they
do
they
no
good
to
anybody
they
not
cuffed
exactly
or
starved
but
you
mean
that
they
do
get
their
share
of
affection
they
get
perhaps
as
much
as
they
deserve
said
dorothy
because
they
or
or
disagreeable
not
exactly
that
what
then
asked
brooke
because
they
just
nobodies
they
are
not
anything
particular
to
anybody
and
so
they
go
on
living
till
they
die
you
know
what
i
mean
burgess
a
man
who
is
a
nobody
can
perhaps
make
himself
somebody
or
at
any
rate
he
can
try
but
a
woman
has
no
means
of
trying
she
is
a
nobody
and
a
nobody
she
must
remain
she
has
her
clothes
and
her
food
but
she
is
wanted
anywhere
people
put
up
with
her
and
that
is
about
the
best
of
her
luck
if
she
were
to
die
somebody
perhaps
would
be
sorry
for
her
but
nobody
would
be
worse
off
she
does
earn
anything
or
do
any
good
she
is
just
there
and
that
all
brooke
had
never
heard
her
speak
after
this
fashion
before
had
never
known
her
to
utter
so
many
consecutive
words
or
to
put
forward
any
opinion
of
her
own
with
so
much
vigour
and
dorothy
herself
when
she
had
concluded
her
speech
was
frightened
by
her
own
energy
and
grew
red
in
the
face
and
showed
very
plainly
that
she
was
half
ashamed
of
herself
brooke
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
pretty
before
and
was
pleased
by
her
enthusiasm
he
understood
perfectly
that
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
position
though
she
had
entertained
no
idea
that
he
would
so
read
her
meaning
and
he
felt
that
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
undeceive
her
and
make
her
know
that
she
was
not
one
of
those
women
who
are
just
there
and
that
all
one
does
see
such
a
woman
as
that
now
and
again
he
said
there
are
hundreds
of
them
said
dorothy
and
of
course
it
be
helped
such
as
arabella
french
said
he
laughing
well
yes
if
she
is
one
it
is
very
easy
to
see
the
difference
some
people
are
of
use
and
are
always
doing
things
there
are
others
generally
women
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
who
ca
be
got
rid
of
it
is
a
melancholy
sort
of
feeling
you
at
least
are
not
one
of
them
i
did
mean
to
complain
about
myself
she
said
i
have
got
a
great
deal
to
make
me
happy
i
do
suppose
you
regard
yourself
as
an
arabella
french
said
he
how
angry
miss
french
would
be
if
she
heard
you
she
considers
herself
to
be
one
of
the
reigning
beauties
of
exeter
she
has
had
a
very
long
reign
and
dominion
of
that
sort
to
be
successful
ought
to
be
short
that
is
spiteful
mr
burgess
i
do
feel
spiteful
against
her
poor
woman
i
own
i
do
not
love
camilla
not
that
i
begrudge
camilla
her
present
prosperity
nor
i
either
mr
burgess
she
and
gibson
will
do
very
well
together
i
dare
say
i
hope
they
will
said
dorothy
and
i
do
not
see
any
reason
against
it
they
have
known
each
other
a
long
time
a
very
long
time
said
brooke
then
he
paused
for
a
minute
thinking
how
he
might
best
tell
her
that
which
he
had
now
resolved
should
be
told
on
this
occasion
dorothy
finished
her
tea
and
got
up
as
though
she
were
about
to
go
to
her
duty
she
had
been
as
yet
hardly
an
hour
in
the
room
and
the
period
of
her
relief
was
not
fairly
over
but
there
had
come
something
of
a
personal
flavour
in
their
conversation
which
prompted
her
unconsciously
to
leave
him
she
had
without
any
special
indication
of
herself
included
herself
among
that
company
of
old
maids
who
are
born
and
live
and
die
without
that
vital
interest
in
the
affairs
of
life
which
nothing
but
family
duties
the
care
of
children
or
at
least
of
a
husband
will
give
to
a
woman
if
she
had
not
meant
this
she
had
felt
it
he
had
understood
her
meaning
or
at
least
her
feeling
and
had
taken
upon
himself
to
assure
her
that
she
was
not
one
of
the
company
whose
privations
she
had
endeavoured
to
describe
her
instinct
rather
than
her
reason
put
her
at
once
upon
her
guard
and
she
prepared
to
leave
the
room
you
are
not
going
yet
he
said
i
think
i
might
as
well
martha
has
so
much
to
do
and
she
comes
to
me
again
at
five
in
the
morning
do
go
quite
yet
he
said
pulling
out
his
watch
i
know
all
about
the
hours
and
it
wants
twenty
minutes
to
the
proper
time
there
is
no
proper
time
mr
burgess
then
you
can
remain
a
few
minutes
longer
the
fact
is
i
got
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
he
was
now
standing
between
her
and
the
door
so
that
she
could
not
get
away
from
him
but
at
this
moment
she
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
his
purpose
expecting
nothing
of
love
from
him
more
than
she
would
from
sir
peter
mancrudy
her
face
had
become
flushed
when
she
made
her
long
speech
but
there
was
no
blush
on
it
as
she
answered
him
now
of
course
i
can
wait
she
said
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
me
well
i
have
i
should
have
said
it
before
only
that
that
other
man
was
here
he
was
blushing
now
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
felt
that
he
was
in
a
difficulty
there
are
men
to
whom
such
moments
of
their
lives
are
pleasurable
but
brooke
burgess
was
not
one
of
them
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
had
it
done
and
over
so
that
then
he
might
take
pleasure
in
it
what
man
asked
dorothy
in
perfect
innocence
gibson
to
be
sure
i
do
know
that
there
is
anybody
else
oh
gibson
he
never
comes
here
now
and
i
do
suppose
he
will
again
aunt
stanbury
is
so
very
angry
with
him
i
do
care
whether
he
comes
or
not
what
i
mean
is
this
when
i
was
here
before
i
was
told
that
you
were
going
to
marry
him
but
i
was
how
was
i
to
know
that
when
you
did
tell
me
i
certainly
did
know
it
after
i
came
back
from
dartmoor
he
paused
a
moment
as
though
she
might
have
a
word
to
say
she
had
no
word
to
say
and
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
was
coming
she
was
so
far
from
anticipating
the
truth
that
she
was
composed
and
easy
in
her
mind
but
all
that
is
of
no
use
at
all
he
continued
when
i
was
here
before
miss
stanbury
wanted
you
to
marry
gibson
and
of
course
i
had
nothing
to
say
about
it
now
i
want
you
to
marry
me
mr
burgess
dorothy
my
darling
i
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
i
do
indeed
as
soon
as
he
had
commenced
his
protestations
he
became
profuse
enough
with
them
and
made
a
strong
attempt
to
support
them
by
the
action
of
his
hands
but
she
retreated
from
him
step
by
step
till
she
had
regained
her
chair
by
the
and
there
she
seated
herself
safely
as
she
thought
but
he
was
close
to
her
over
her
shoulder
still
continuing
his
protestations
offering
up
his
vows
and
imploring
her
to
reply
to
him
she
as
yet
had
not
answered
him
by
a
word
save
by
that
one
exclamation
of
his
name
tell
me
at
any
rate
that
you
believe
me
when
i
assure
you
that
i
love
you
he
said
the
room
was
going
round
with
dorothy
and
the
world
was
going
round
and
there
had
come
upon
her
so
strong
a
feeling
of
the
disruption
of
things
in
general
that
she
was
at
the
moment
anything
but
happy
had
it
been
possible
for
her
to
find
that
the
last
ten
minutes
had
been
a
dream
she
would
at
this
moment
have
wished
that
it
might
become
one
a
trouble
had
come
upon
her
out
of
which
she
did
not
see
her
way
to
dive
among
the
waters
in
warm
weather
is
very
pleasant
there
is
nothing
pleasanter
but
when
the
young
swimmer
first
feels
the
thorough
immersion
of
his
plunge
there
comes
upon
him
a
strong
desire
to
be
quickly
out
again
he
will
remember
afterwards
how
joyous
it
was
but
now
at
this
moment
the
dry
land
is
everything
to
him
so
it
was
with
dorothy
she
had
thought
of
brooke
burgess
as
one
of
those
bright
ones
of
the
world
with
whom
everything
is
happy
and
pleasant
whom
everybody
loves
who
may
have
whatever
they
please
whose
lines
have
been
laid
in
pleasant
places
she
thought
of
him
as
a
man
who
might
some
day
make
some
woman
very
happy
as
his
wife
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
man
was
in
dorothy
estimation
one
of
those
blessed
chances
which
come
to
some
women
but
which
she
never
regarded
as
being
within
her
own
reach
though
she
had
thought
much
about
him
she
had
never
thought
of
him
as
a
possible
possession
for
herself
and
now
that
he
was
offering
himself
to
her
she
was
not
at
once
made
happy
by
his
love
her
ideas
of
herself
and
of
her
life
were
all
dislocated
for
the
moment
and
she
required
to
be
alone
that
she
might
set
herself
in
order
and
try
herself
all
over
and
find
whether
her
bones
were
broken
say
that
you
believe
me
he
repeated
illustration
the
world
was
going
round
with
dorothy
i
do
know
what
to
say
she
whispered
i
tell
you
what
to
say
say
at
once
that
you
will
be
my
wife
i
ca
say
that
mr
burgess
why
not
do
you
mean
that
you
can
not
love
me
i
think
if
you
please
i
go
up
to
aunt
stanbury
it
is
time
for
me
indeed
it
is
and
she
will
be
wondering
and
martha
will
be
put
out
indeed
i
must
go
up
and
will
you
not
answer
me
i
do
know
what
to
say
you
must
give
me
a
little
time
to
consider
i
do
quite
think
you
serious
heaven
and
earth
began
brooke
and
i
sure
it
would
never
do
at
any
rate
i
must
go
now
i
must
indeed
and
so
she
escaped
and
went
up
to
her
aunt
room
which
she
reached
at
ten
minutes
after
her
usual
time
and
before
martha
had
begun
to
be
put
out
she
was
very
civil
to
martha
as
though
martha
had
been
injured
and
she
put
her
hand
on
her
aunt
arm
with
a
soft
caressing
apologetic
touch
feeling
conscious
that
she
had
given
cause
for
offence
what
has
he
been
saying
to
you
said
her
aunt
as
soon
as
martha
had
closed
the
door
this
was
a
question
which
dorothy
certainly
could
not
answer
miss
stanbury
meant
nothing
by
it
nothing
beyond
a
sick
woman
desire
that
something
of
the
conversation
of
those
who
were
not
sick
should
be
retailed
to
her
but
to
dorothy
the
question
meant
so
much
how
should
her
aunt
have
known
that
he
had
said
anything
she
sat
herself
down
and
waited
giving
no
answer
to
the
question
i
hope
he
gets
his
meals
comfortably
said
miss
stanbury
i
am
sure
he
does
said
dorothy
infinitely
relieved
then
knowing
how
important
it
was
that
her
aunt
should
sleep
she
took
up
the
volume
of
jeremy
taylor
and
with
so
great
a
burden
on
her
mind
she
went
on
painfully
and
distinctly
with
the
second
sermon
on
the
marriage
ring
she
strove
valiantly
to
keep
her
mind
to
the
godliness
of
the
discourse
so
that
it
might
be
of
some
possible
service
to
herself
and
to
keep
her
voice
to
the
tone
that
might
be
of
service
to
her
aunt
presently
she
heard
the
grateful
sound
which
indicated
her
aunt
repose
but
she
knew
of
experience
that
were
she
to
stop
the
sound
and
the
sleep
would
come
to
an
end
also
for
a
whole
hour
she
persevered
reading
the
sermon
of
the
marriage
ring
with
such
attention
to
the
godly
principles
of
the
teaching
as
she
could
give
with
that
terrible
burden
upon
her
mind
thank
you
thank
you
that
will
do
my
dear
shut
it
up
said
the
sick
woman
it
time
now
for
the
draught
then
dorothy
moved
quietly
about
the
room
and
did
her
nurse
work
with
soft
hand
and
soft
touch
and
soft
tread
after
that
her
aunt
kissed
her
and
bade
her
sit
down
and
sleep
i
go
on
reading
aunt
if
you
let
me
said
dorothy
but
miss
stanbury
who
was
not
a
cruel
woman
would
have
no
more
of
the
reading
and
dorothy
mind
was
left
at
liberty
to
think
of
the
proposition
that
had
been
made
to
her
to
one
resolution
she
came
very
quickly
the
period
of
her
aunt
illness
could
not
be
a
proper
time
for
marriage
vows
or
the
amenities
of
she
did
not
feel
that
he
being
a
man
had
offended
but
she
was
quite
sure
that
were
she
a
woman
the
niece
of
so
kind
an
aunt
the
nurse
at
the
of
such
an
invalid
were
she
at
such
a
time
to
consent
to
talk
of
love
she
would
never
deserve
to
have
a
lover
and
from
this
resolve
she
got
great
comfort
it
would
give
her
an
excuse
for
making
no
more
assured
answer
at
present
and
would
enable
her
to
reflect
at
leisure
as
to
the
reply
she
would
give
him
should
he
ever
by
any
chance
renew
his
offer
if
he
did
not
and
probably
he
would
not
then
it
would
have
been
very
well
that
he
should
not
have
been
made
the
victim
of
a
momentary
generosity
she
had
complained
of
the
dulness
of
her
life
and
that
complaint
from
her
had
produced
his
noble
kind
generous
dear
enthusiastic
benevolence
towards
her
as
she
thought
of
it
all
and
by
degrees
she
took
great
pleasure
in
thinking
of
it
her
mind
bestowed
upon
him
all
manner
of
eulogies
she
could
not
persuade
herself
that
he
really
loved
her
and
yet
she
was
full
at
heart
of
gratitude
to
him
for
the
expression
of
his
love
and
as
for
herself
could
she
love
him
we
who
are
looking
on
of
course
know
that
she
loved
him
that
from
this
moment
there
was
nothing
belonging
to
him
down
to
his
that
would
not
be
dear
to
her
heart
and
an
emblem
so
tender
as
to
force
a
tear
from
her
he
had
already
become
her
god
though
she
did
not
know
it
she
made
comparisons
between
him
and
gibson
and
tried
to
convince
herself
that
the
judgment
which
was
always
pronounced
very
clearly
in
brooke
favour
came
from
anything
but
her
heart
and
thus
through
the
long
watches
of
the
night
she
became
very
happy
feeling
but
not
knowing
that
the
whole
aspect
of
the
world
was
changed
to
her
by
those
few
words
which
her
lover
had
spoken
to
her
she
thought
now
that
it
would
be
consolation
enough
to
her
in
future
to
know
that
such
a
man
as
brooke
burgess
had
once
asked
her
to
be
the
partner
of
his
life
and
that
it
would
be
almost
ungenerous
in
her
to
push
her
advantage
further
and
attempt
to
take
him
at
his
word
besides
there
would
be
obstacles
her
aunt
would
dislike
such
a
marriage
for
him
and
he
would
be
bound
to
obey
her
aunt
in
such
a
matter
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
think
that
she
could
ever
become
brooke
wife
but
nothing
could
rob
her
of
the
treasure
of
the
offer
which
he
had
made
her
then
martha
came
to
her
at
five
and
she
went
to
her
bed
to
dream
for
an
hour
or
two
of
brooke
burgess
and
her
future
life
on
the
next
morning
she
met
him
at
breakfast
she
went
down
stairs
later
than
usual
not
till
ten
having
hung
about
her
aunt
room
thinking
that
thus
she
would
escape
him
for
the
present
she
would
wait
till
he
was
gone
out
and
then
she
would
go
down
she
did
wait
but
she
could
not
hear
the
front
door
and
then
her
aunt
murmured
something
about
brooke
breakfast
she
was
told
to
go
down
and
she
went
but
when
on
the
stairs
she
slunk
back
to
her
own
room
and
stood
there
for
awhile
aimless
motionless
not
knowing
what
to
do
then
one
of
the
girls
came
to
her
and
told
her
that
burgess
was
waiting
breakfast
for
her
she
knew
not
what
excuse
to
make
and
at
last
descended
slowly
to
the
parlour
she
was
very
happy
but
had
it
been
possible
for
her
to
have
run
away
she
would
have
gone
dear
dorothy
he
said
at
once
i
may
call
you
so
may
i
not
oh
yes
and
you
will
love
me
and
be
my
own
own
wife
no
mr
burgess
no
i
mean
that
is
to
say
do
you
love
me
dorothy
only
think
how
ill
aunt
stanbury
is
burgess
perhaps
dying
how
can
i
have
any
thought
now
except
about
her
it
would
be
right
would
it
you
may
say
that
you
love
me
burgess
pray
pray
do
speak
of
it
now
if
you
do
i
must
go
away
but
do
you
love
me
pray
pray
do
mr
burgess
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
got
from
her
during
the
whole
day
than
that
he
told
her
in
the
evening
that
as
soon
as
miss
stanbury
was
well
he
would
come
again
that
in
any
case
he
would
come
again
she
sat
quite
still
as
he
said
this
with
a
solemn
face
but
smiling
at
heart
laughing
at
heart
so
happy
when
she
got
up
to
leave
him
and
was
forced
to
give
him
her
hand
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
that
is
very
very
wrong
she
said
sobbing
and
then
ran
to
her
room
the
happiest
girl
in
all
exeter
he
was
to
start
early
on
the
following
morning
and
she
knew
that
she
would
not
be
forced
to
see
him
again
thinking
of
him
was
so
much
pleasanter
than
seeing
him
chapter
lii
outhouse
complains
that
it
hard
life
had
gone
on
during
the
winter
at
diddulph
parsonage
in
a
dull
weary
painful
manner
there
had
come
a
letter
in
november
from
trevelyan
to
his
wife
saying
that
as
he
could
trust
neither
her
nor
her
uncle
with
the
custody
of
his
child
he
should
send
a
person
armed
with
due
legal
authority
addressed
to
outhouse
for
the
recovery
of
the
boy
and
desiring
that
little
louis
might
be
at
once
surrendered
to
the
messenger
then
of
course
there
had
arisen
great
trouble
in
the
house
both
trevelyan
and
nora
rowley
had
learned
by
this
time
that
as
regarded
the
master
of
the
house
they
were
not
welcome
guests
at
diddulph
when
the
threat
was
shewn
to
outhouse
he
did
not
say
a
word
to
indicate
that
the
child
should
be
given
up
he
muttered
something
indeed
about
impotent
nonsense
which
seemed
to
imply
that
the
threat
could
be
of
no
avail
but
there
was
none
of
that
reassurance
to
be
obtained
from
him
which
a
positive
promise
on
his
part
to
hold
the
bairn
against
all
comers
would
have
given
outhouse
told
her
niece
more
than
once
that
the
child
would
be
given
to
no
messenger
whatever
but
even
she
did
not
give
the
assurance
with
that
energy
which
the
mother
would
have
liked
they
shall
drag
him
away
from
me
by
force
if
they
do
take
him
said
the
mother
gnashing
her
teeth
oh
if
her
father
would
but
come
for
some
weeks
she
did
not
let
the
boy
out
of
her
sight
but
when
no
messenger
had
presented
himself
by
christmas
time
they
all
began
to
believe
that
the
threat
had
in
truth
meant
nothing
that
it
had
been
part
of
the
ravings
of
a
madman
but
the
threat
had
meant
something
early
on
one
morning
in
january
outhouse
was
told
that
a
person
in
the
hall
wanted
to
see
him
and
trevelyan
who
was
sitting
at
breakfast
the
child
being
at
the
moment
started
from
her
seat
the
maid
described
the
man
as
being
all
as
one
as
a
gentleman
though
she
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
was
a
gentleman
in
fact
outhouse
slowly
rose
from
his
breakfast
went
out
to
the
man
in
the
passage
and
bade
him
follow
into
the
little
closet
that
was
now
used
as
a
study
it
is
needless
perhaps
to
say
that
the
man
was
bozzle
i
dare
say
houthouse
you
do
know
me
said
bozzle
outhouse
disdaining
all
complimentary
language
said
that
he
certainly
did
not
my
name
houthouse
is
samuel
bozzle
and
i
live
at
no
stony
walk
union
street
borough
i
was
in
the
force
once
but
i
work
on
my
own
now
what
do
you
want
with
me
mr
bozzle
it
is
so
much
with
you
sir
as
it
is
with
a
lady
as
is
under
your
protection
and
it
is
so
much
with
the
lady
as
it
is
with
her
infant
then
you
may
go
away
bozzle
said
outhouse
impatiently
you
may
as
well
go
away
at
once
will
you
please
read
them
few
lines
sir
said
bozzle
they
is
in
trewilyan
handwriting
which
will
no
doubt
be
familiar
characters
leastways
to
if
you
do
know
the
fist
outhouse
after
looking
at
the
paper
for
a
minute
and
considering
deeply
what
in
this
emergency
he
had
better
do
did
take
the
paper
and
read
it
the
words
ran
as
follows
i
hereby
give
full
authority
to
samuel
bozzle
of
stony
walk
union
street
borough
to
claim
and
to
enforce
possession
of
the
body
of
my
child
louis
trevelyan
and
i
require
that
any
person
whatsoever
who
may
now
have
the
custody
of
the
said
child
whether
it
be
my
wife
or
any
of
her
friends
shall
at
once
deliver
him
up
to
bozzle
on
the
production
of
this
louis
trevelyan
it
may
be
explained
that
before
this
document
had
been
written
there
had
been
much
correspondence
on
the
subject
between
bozzle
and
his
employer
to
give
the
his
due
he
had
not
at
first
wished
to
meddle
in
the
matter
of
the
child
he
had
a
wife
at
home
who
expressed
an
opinion
with
much
vigour
that
the
boy
should
be
left
with
its
mother
and
that
he
bozzle
should
he
succeed
in
getting
hold
of
the
child
would
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
bozzle
was
aware
moreover
that
it
was
his
business
to
find
out
facts
and
not
to
perform
actions
but
his
employer
had
become
very
urgent
with
him
bideawhile
had
positively
refused
to
move
in
the
matter
and
trevelyan
mad
as
he
was
had
felt
a
disinclination
to
throw
his
affairs
into
the
hands
of
a
certain
skint
of
stamford
street
whom
bozzle
had
recommended
to
him
as
a
lawyer
trevelyan
had
hinted
moreover
that
if
bozzle
would
make
the
application
in
person
that
application
if
not
obeyed
would
act
with
usefulness
as
a
preliminary
step
for
further
personal
measures
to
be
taken
by
himself
he
intended
to
return
to
england
for
the
purpose
but
he
desired
that
the
order
for
the
child
rendition
should
be
made
at
once
therefore
bozzle
had
come
he
was
an
earnest
man
and
had
now
worked
himself
up
to
a
certain
degree
of
energy
in
the
matter
he
was
a
man
loving
power
and
specially
anxious
to
enforce
obedience
from
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
by
the
production
of
the
law
mysterious
authority
in
his
heart
he
was
ever
tapping
people
on
the
shoulder
and
telling
them
that
they
were
wanted
thus
when
he
displayed
his
document
to
outhouse
he
had
taught
himself
at
least
to
desire
that
that
document
should
be
obeyed
outhouse
read
the
paper
and
turned
up
his
nose
at
it
you
had
better
go
away
said
he
as
he
thrust
it
back
into
bozzle
hand
of
course
i
shall
go
away
when
i
have
the
child
psha
said
outhouse
what
does
that
mean
houthouse
i
presume
you
not
dispute
the
paternal
parent
legal
authority
go
away
sir
said
outhouse
go
away
yes
out
of
this
house
it
my
belief
that
you
are
a
knave
a
knave
mr
houthouse
yes
a
knave
no
one
who
was
not
a
knave
would
lend
a
hand
towards
separating
a
little
child
from
its
mother
i
think
you
are
a
knave
but
i
do
think
you
are
fool
enough
to
suppose
that
the
child
will
be
given
up
to
you
it
my
belief
that
knave
is
hactionable
said
bozzle
whose
respect
however
for
the
clergyman
was
rising
fast
would
you
mind
ringing
the
bell
houthouse
and
calling
me
a
knave
again
before
the
young
woman
go
away
said
outhouse
if
you
have
no
objection
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
see
the
lady
before
i
goes
you
wo
see
any
lady
here
and
if
you
do
get
out
of
my
house
when
i
tell
you
i
send
for
a
real
policeman
then
was
bozzle
conquered
and
as
he
went
he
admitted
to
himself
that
he
had
sinned
against
all
the
rules
of
his
life
in
attempting
to
go
beyond
the
legitimate
line
of
his
profession
as
long
as
he
confined
himself
to
the
getting
up
of
facts
nobody
could
threaten
him
with
a
real
policeman
but
one
fact
he
had
learned
the
clergyman
of
diddulph
who
had
been
represented
to
him
as
a
weak
foolish
man
was
anything
but
that
bozzle
was
much
impressed
in
favour
of
outhouse
and
would
have
been
glad
to
have
done
that
gentleman
a
kindness
had
an
opportunity
come
in
his
way
what
does
he
want
uncle
oliphant
said
trevelyan
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
guarding
the
way
up
to
the
nursery
at
this
moment
the
front
door
had
just
been
closed
behind
the
back
of
bozzle
you
had
better
ask
no
questions
said
outhouse
but
is
it
about
louis
yes
he
came
about
him
well
of
course
you
must
tell
me
uncle
oliphant
think
of
my
condition
he
had
some
stupid
paper
in
his
hand
from
your
husband
but
it
meant
nothing
he
was
the
messenger
then
yes
he
was
the
messenger
but
i
do
suppose
he
expected
to
get
anything
never
mind
go
up
and
look
after
the
child
then
trevelyan
returned
to
her
boy
and
outhouse
went
back
to
his
papers
it
was
very
hard
upon
him
outhouse
thought
very
hard
he
was
threatened
with
an
action
now
and
most
probably
would
become
subject
to
one
though
he
had
been
spirited
enough
in
presence
of
the
enemy
he
was
very
much
out
of
spirits
at
this
moment
though
he
had
admitted
to
himself
that
his
duty
required
him
to
protect
his
niece
he
had
never
taken
the
poor
woman
to
his
heart
with
a
loving
generous
feeling
of
true
guardianship
though
he
would
not
give
up
the
child
to
bozzle
he
thoroughly
wished
that
the
child
was
out
of
his
house
though
he
called
bozzle
a
knave
and
trevelyan
a
madman
still
he
considered
that
colonel
osborne
was
the
chief
sinner
and
that
emily
trevelyan
had
behaved
badly
he
constantly
repeated
to
himself
the
old
adage
that
there
was
no
smoke
without
fire
and
lamented
the
misfortune
that
had
brought
him
into
close
relation
with
things
and
people
that
were
so
little
to
his
taste
he
sat
for
awhile
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
at
the
miserable
little
substitute
for
a
library
table
which
had
been
provided
for
him
and
strove
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
go
on
with
his
work
but
the
effort
was
in
vain
bozzle
would
be
there
presenting
his
document
and
begging
that
the
maid
might
be
rung
for
in
order
that
she
might
hear
him
called
a
knave
and
then
he
knew
that
on
this
very
day
his
niece
intended
to
hand
him
money
which
he
could
not
refuse
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
refuse
it
now
after
it
had
been
once
taken
as
he
could
not
write
a
word
he
rose
and
went
away
to
his
wife
if
this
goes
on
much
longer
said
he
i
shall
be
in
bedlam
my
dear
do
speak
of
it
in
that
way
that
all
very
well
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
that
i
like
it
there
has
been
a
policeman
here
who
is
going
to
bring
an
action
against
me
a
policeman
some
one
that
her
husband
has
sent
for
the
child
the
boy
must
not
be
given
up
oliphant
it
all
very
well
to
say
that
but
i
suppose
we
must
obey
the
law
the
parsonage
of
diddulph
is
a
castle
in
the
apennines
when
it
comes
to
this
that
a
policeman
is
sent
here
to
fetch
any
child
and
threatens
me
with
an
action
because
i
tell
him
to
leave
my
house
it
is
very
hard
upon
me
seeing
how
very
little
i
had
to
do
with
it
it
all
over
the
parish
now
that
my
niece
is
kept
here
away
from
her
husband
and
that
a
lover
comes
to
see
her
this
about
the
policeman
will
be
known
now
of
course
i
only
say
it
is
hard
all
the
wife
did
all
that
she
could
to
comfort
him
reminding
him
that
sir
marmaduke
would
be
home
soon
and
that
then
the
burden
would
be
taken
from
his
shoulders
but
she
was
forced
to
admit
that
it
was
very
hard

hugh
stanbury
is
shewn
to
be
no
conjuror
illustration
many
weeks
had
now
passed
since
hugh
stanbury
had
paid
his
visit
to
diddulph
and
nora
rowley
was
beginning
to
believe
that
her
rejection
of
her
lover
had
been
so
firm
and
decided
that
she
would
never
see
him
or
hear
from
him
more
and
she
had
long
since
confessed
to
herself
that
if
she
did
not
see
him
or
hear
from
him
soon
life
would
not
be
worth
a
straw
to
her
to
all
of
us
a
single
treasure
counts
for
much
more
when
the
outward
circumstances
of
our
life
are
dull
unvaried
and
melancholy
than
it
does
when
our
days
are
full
of
pleasure
or
excitement
or
even
of
business
with
nora
rowley
at
diddulph
life
at
present
was
very
melancholy
there
was
little
or
no
society
to
enliven
her
her
sister
was
sick
at
heart
and
becoming
ill
in
health
under
the
burden
of
her
troubles
outhouse
was
moody
and
wretched
and
outhouse
though
she
did
her
best
to
make
her
house
comfortable
to
her
unwelcome
inmates
could
not
make
it
appear
that
their
presence
there
was
a
pleasure
to
her
nora
understood
better
than
did
her
sister
how
distasteful
the
present
arrangement
was
to
their
uncle
and
was
consequently
very
uncomfortable
on
that
score
and
in
the
midst
of
that
unhappiness
she
of
course
told
herself
that
she
was
a
young
woman
miserable
and
unfortunate
altogether
it
is
always
so
with
us
the
heart
when
it
is
burdened
though
it
may
have
ample
strength
to
bear
the
burden
loses
its
buoyancy
and
doubts
its
own
power
it
is
like
the
springs
of
a
carriage
which
are
pressed
flat
by
the
superincumbent
weight
but
because
the
springs
are
good
the
weight
is
carried
safely
and
they
are
the
better
afterwards
for
their
required
purposes
because
of
the
trial
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
nora
had
sent
her
lover
away
and
now
at
the
end
of
three
months
from
the
day
of
his
dismissal
she
had
taught
herself
to
believe
that
he
would
never
come
again
amidst
the
sadness
of
her
life
at
diddulph
some
confidence
in
a
lover
expected
to
come
again
would
have
done
much
to
cheer
her
the
more
she
thought
of
hugh
stanbury
the
more
fully
she
became
convinced
that
he
was
the
man
who
as
a
lover
as
a
husband
and
as
a
companion
would
just
suit
all
her
tastes
she
endowed
him
liberally
with
a
hundred
good
gifts
in
the
disposal
of
which
nature
had
been
much
more
sparing
she
made
for
herself
a
mental
portrait
of
him
more
gracious
in
its
flattery
than
ever
was
canvas
coming
from
the
hand
of
a
court
limner
she
gave
him
all
gifts
of
manliness
honesty
truth
and
energy
and
felt
regarding
him
that
he
was
a
paladin
such
as
paladins
are
in
this
age
that
he
was
indomitable
sure
of
success
and
fitted
in
all
respects
to
take
the
high
position
which
he
would
certainly
win
for
himself
but
she
did
not
presume
him
to
be
endowed
with
such
a
constancy
as
would
make
him
come
to
seek
her
hand
again
had
nora
at
this
time
of
her
life
been
living
at
the
of
london
and
going
out
to
parties
three
or
four
times
a
week
she
would
have
been
quite
easy
about
his
coming
the
springs
would
not
have
been
weighted
so
heavily
and
her
heart
would
have
been
elastic
no
doubt
she
had
forgotten
many
of
the
circumstances
of
his
visit
and
of
his
departure
immediately
on
his
going
she
had
told
her
sister
that
he
would
certainly
come
again
but
had
said
at
the
same
time
that
his
coming
could
be
of
no
use
he
was
so
poor
a
man
and
she
though
poorer
than
he
had
been
so
little
accustomed
to
poverty
of
life
that
she
had
then
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
was
not
fit
to
be
his
wife
gradually
as
the
slow
weeks
went
by
her
there
had
come
a
change
in
her
ideas
she
now
thought
that
he
never
would
come
again
but
that
if
he
did
she
would
confess
to
him
that
her
own
views
about
life
were
changed
i
would
tell
him
frankly
that
i
could
eat
a
crust
with
him
in
any
garret
in
london
but
this
was
said
to
herself
never
to
her
sister
emily
and
outhouse
had
determined
together
that
it
would
be
wise
to
abstain
from
all
mention
of
hugh
stanbury
name
nora
had
felt
that
her
sister
had
so
abstained
and
this
reticence
had
assisted
in
producing
the
despair
which
had
come
upon
her
hugh
when
he
had
left
her
had
certainly
given
her
encouragement
to
expect
that
he
would
return
she
had
been
sure
then
that
he
would
return
she
had
been
sure
of
it
though
she
had
told
him
that
it
would
be
useless
but
now
when
these
sad
weeks
had
slowly
crept
over
her
head
when
during
the
long
hours
of
the
long
days
she
had
thought
of
him
continually
telling
herself
that
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
ever
become
the
wife
of
any
man
if
she
did
not
become
his
she
assured
herself
that
she
had
seen
and
heard
the
last
of
him
she
must
surely
have
forgotten
his
hot
words
and
that
daring
embrace
then
there
came
a
letter
to
her
the
question
of
the
management
of
letters
for
young
ladies
is
handled
very
differently
in
different
houses
in
some
establishments
the
post
is
as
free
to
young
ladies
as
it
is
to
the
reverend
seniors
of
the
household
in
others
it
is
considered
to
be
quite
a
matter
of
course
that
some
experienced
discretion
should
sit
in
judgment
on
the
correspondence
of
the
daughters
of
the
family
when
nora
rowley
was
living
with
her
sister
in
curzon
street
she
would
have
been
very
indignant
indeed
had
it
been
suggested
to
her
that
there
was
any
authority
over
her
letters
vested
in
her
sister
but
now
circumstanced
as
she
was
at
diddulph
she
did
understand
that
no
letter
would
reach
her
without
her
aunt
knowing
that
it
had
come
all
this
was
distasteful
to
her
as
were
indeed
all
the
details
of
her
life
at
diddulph
but
she
could
not
help
herself
had
her
aunt
told
her
that
she
should
never
be
allowed
to
receive
a
letter
at
all
she
must
have
submitted
till
her
mother
had
come
to
her
relief
the
letter
which
reached
her
now
was
put
into
her
hands
by
her
sister
but
it
had
been
given
to
trevelyan
by
outhouse
nora
said
trevelyan
here
is
a
letter
for
you
i
think
it
is
from
mr
stanbury
give
it
me
said
nora
greedily
of
course
i
will
give
it
you
but
i
hope
you
do
not
intend
to
correspond
with
him
if
he
has
written
to
me
i
shall
answer
him
of
course
said
nora
holding
her
treasure
aunt
mary
thinks
that
you
should
not
do
so
till
papa
and
mamma
have
arrived
if
aunt
mary
is
afraid
of
me
let
her
tell
me
so
and
i
will
contrive
to
go
somewhere
else
poor
nora
knew
that
this
threat
was
futile
there
was
no
house
to
which
she
could
take
herself
she
is
not
afraid
of
you
at
all
nora
she
only
says
that
she
thinks
you
should
not
write
to
mr
stanbury
then
nora
escaped
to
the
cold
but
solitary
seclusion
of
her
and
there
she
read
her
letter
the
reader
may
remember
that
hugh
stanbury
when
he
last
left
diddulph
had
not
been
oppressed
by
any
of
the
gloomy
reveries
of
a
despairing
lover
he
had
spoken
his
mind
freely
to
nora
and
had
felt
himself
justified
in
believing
that
he
had
not
spoken
in
vain
he
had
had
her
in
his
arms
and
she
had
found
it
impossible
to
say
that
she
did
not
love
him
but
then
she
had
been
quite
firm
in
her
purpose
to
give
him
no
encouragement
that
she
could
avoid
she
had
said
no
word
that
would
justify
him
in
considering
that
there
was
any
engagement
between
them
and
moreover
he
had
been
warned
not
to
come
to
the
house
by
its
mistress
from
day
to
day
he
thought
of
it
all
now
telling
himself
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
trust
in
her
fidelity
till
he
should
be
in
a
position
to
offer
her
a
fitting
home
and
then
reflecting
that
he
could
not
expect
such
a
girl
as
nora
rowley
to
wait
for
him
unless
he
could
succeed
in
making
her
understand
that
he
at
any
rate
intended
to
wait
for
her
on
one
day
he
would
think
that
good
faith
and
proper
consideration
for
nora
herself
required
him
to
keep
silent
on
the
next
he
would
tell
himself
that
such
maudlin
chivalry
as
he
was
proposing
to
himself
was
sure
to
go
to
the
wall
and
be
neither
rewarded
nor
recognised
so
at
last
he
sat
down
and
wrote
the
following
letter
lincoln
inn
fields
january
dearest
nora
ever
since
i
last
saw
you
at
diddulph
i
have
been
trying
to
teach
myself
what
i
ought
to
do
in
reference
to
you
sometimes
i
think
that
because
i
am
poor
i
ought
to
hold
my
tongue
at
others
i
feel
sure
that
i
ought
to
speak
out
loud
because
i
love
you
so
dearly
you
may
presume
that
just
at
this
moment
the
latter
opinion
is
in
the
ascendant
as
i
do
write
i
mean
to
be
very
bold
so
bold
that
if
i
am
wrong
you
will
be
thoroughly
disgusted
with
me
and
will
never
willingly
see
me
again
but
i
think
it
best
to
be
true
and
to
say
what
i
think
i
do
believe
that
you
love
me
according
to
all
precedent
i
ought
not
to
say
so
but
i
do
believe
it
ever
since
i
was
at
diddulph
that
belief
has
made
me
happy
though
there
have
been
moments
of
doubt
if
i
thought
that
you
did
not
love
me
i
would
trouble
you
no
further
a
man
may
win
his
way
to
love
when
social
circumstances
are
such
as
to
throw
him
and
the
girl
together
but
such
is
not
the
case
with
us
and
unless
you
love
me
now
you
never
will
love
me
i
do
i
do
said
nora
pressing
the
letter
to
her
bosom
if
you
do
i
think
that
you
owe
it
me
to
say
so
and
to
let
me
have
all
the
joy
and
all
the
feeling
of
responsibility
which
such
an
assurance
will
give
me
i
will
tell
him
so
said
nora
i
do
care
what
may
come
afterwards
but
i
will
tell
him
the
truth
i
know
continued
hugh
that
an
engagement
with
me
now
would
be
hazardous
because
what
i
earn
is
both
scanty
and
precarious
but
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
could
ever
be
done
without
some
risk
there
are
risks
of
different
kinds
she
wondered
whether
he
was
thinking
when
he
wrote
this
of
the
rock
on
which
her
sister
barque
had
been
split
to
pieces
and
we
may
hardly
hope
to
avoid
them
all
for
myself
i
own
that
life
would
be
tame
to
me
if
there
were
no
dangers
to
be
overcome
if
you
do
love
me
and
will
say
so
i
will
not
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
till
i
can
give
you
a
proper
home
but
the
knowledge
that
i
am
the
master
of
the
treasure
which
i
desire
will
give
me
a
double
energy
and
will
make
me
feel
that
when
i
have
gained
so
much
i
can
not
fail
of
adding
to
it
all
other
smaller
things
that
may
be
necessary
pray
pray
send
me
an
answer
i
can
not
reach
you
except
by
writing
as
i
was
told
by
your
aunt
not
to
come
to
the
house
again
dearest
nora
pray
believe
that
i
shall
always
be
truly
yours
only
hugh
stanbury
write
to
him
of
course
she
would
write
to
him
of
course
she
would
confess
to
him
the
truth
he
tells
me
that
i
owe
it
to
him
to
say
so
and
i
acknowledge
the
debt
she
said
aloud
to
herself
and
as
for
a
proper
home
he
shall
be
the
judge
of
that
she
resolved
that
she
would
not
be
a
fine
lady
not
fastidious
not
coy
not
afraid
to
take
her
full
share
of
the
risk
of
which
he
spoke
in
such
manly
terms
it
is
quite
true
as
he
has
been
able
to
make
me
love
him
i
have
no
right
to
stand
aloof
even
if
i
wished
it
as
she
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
so
resolving
her
sister
came
to
her
well
dear
said
emily
may
i
ask
what
it
is
he
says
nora
paused
a
moment
holding
the
letter
tight
in
her
hand
and
then
she
held
it
out
to
her
sister
there
it
is
you
may
read
it
trevelyan
took
the
letter
and
read
it
slowly
during
which
nora
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
she
would
not
watch
her
face
as
she
did
not
wish
to
have
to
reply
to
any
outward
signs
of
disapproval
give
it
me
back
she
said
when
she
heard
by
the
refolding
of
the
paper
that
the
perusal
was
finished
of
course
i
shall
give
it
you
back
dear
yes
thanks
i
did
not
mean
to
doubt
you
and
what
will
you
do
nora
answer
it
of
course
i
would
think
a
little
before
i
answered
it
said
trevelyan
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
already
and
how
will
you
answer
it
nora
paused
again
before
she
replied
as
nearly
as
i
know
how
to
do
in
such
words
as
he
would
put
into
my
mouth
i
shall
strive
to
write
just
what
i
think
he
would
wish
me
to
write
then
you
will
engage
yourself
to
him
nora
certainly
i
shall
i
am
engaged
to
him
already
i
have
been
ever
since
he
came
here
you
told
me
that
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
i
told
you
that
i
loved
him
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
and
that
ought
to
have
made
you
know
what
it
must
come
to
when
i
am
thinking
of
him
every
day
and
every
hour
how
can
i
not
be
glad
to
have
an
engagement
settled
with
him
i
could
marry
anybody
else
and
i
do
want
to
remain
as
i
am
the
tears
came
into
the
married
sister
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
as
this
was
said
to
her
would
it
not
have
been
better
for
her
had
she
remained
as
she
was
dear
emily
said
nora
you
have
got
louey
still
yes
and
they
mean
to
take
him
from
me
but
i
do
not
wish
to
speak
of
myself
will
you
postpone
your
answer
till
mamma
is
here
i
can
not
do
that
emily
what
receive
such
a
letter
as
that
and
send
no
reply
to
it
i
would
write
a
line
for
you
and
explain
no
indeed
emily
i
choose
to
answer
my
own
letters
i
have
shewn
you
that
because
i
trust
you
but
i
have
fully
made
up
my
mind
as
to
what
i
shall
write
it
will
have
been
written
and
sent
before
dinner
i
think
you
will
be
wrong
nora
why
wrong
when
i
came
over
here
to
stay
with
you
would
mamma
ever
have
thought
of
directing
me
not
to
accept
any
offer
till
her
consent
had
been
obtained
all
the
way
from
the
mandarins
she
would
never
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
will
you
ask
aunt
mary
certainly
not
what
is
aunt
mary
to
me
we
are
here
in
her
house
for
a
time
under
the
press
of
circumstances
but
i
owe
her
no
obedience
she
told
stanbury
not
to
come
here
and
he
has
not
come
and
i
shall
not
ask
him
to
come
i
would
not
willingly
bring
any
one
into
uncle
oliphant
house
that
he
and
she
do
not
wish
to
see
but
i
will
not
admit
that
either
of
them
have
any
authority
over
me
then
who
has
dearest
nobody
except
papa
and
mamma
and
they
have
chosen
to
leave
me
to
myself
trevelyan
found
it
impossible
to
shake
her
sister
firmness
and
could
herself
do
nothing
except
tell
outhouse
what
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
she
said
that
she
should
do
this
there
almost
came
to
be
a
flow
of
high
words
between
the
two
sisters
but
at
last
nora
assented
as
for
knowing
i
do
care
if
all
the
world
knows
it
i
shall
do
nothing
in
a
corner
i
do
suppose
aunt
mary
will
endeavour
to
prevent
my
posting
my
letter
emily
at
last
went
to
seek
outhouse
and
nora
at
once
sat
down
to
her
desk
neither
of
the
sisters
felt
at
all
sure
that
outhouse
would
not
attempt
to
stop
the
emission
of
the
letter
from
her
house
but
as
it
happened
she
was
out
and
did
not
return
till
nora
had
come
back
from
her
journey
to
the
neighbouring
she
would
trust
her
letter
when
written
to
no
hands
but
her
own
and
as
she
herself
dropped
it
into
the
safe
custody
of
the
it
also
shall
be
revealed
to
the
public
parsonage
diddulph
january
dear
hugh
for
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
write
to
you
in
that
way
now
i
have
been
made
so
happy
by
your
affectionate
letter
is
not
that
a
candid
confession
for
a
young
lady
but
you
tell
me
that
i
owe
you
the
truth
and
so
i
tell
you
the
truth
nobody
will
ever
be
anything
to
me
except
you
and
you
are
everything
i
do
love
you
and
should
it
ever
be
possible
i
will
become
your
wife
i
have
said
so
much
because
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
obey
the
order
you
have
given
me
but
pray
do
not
try
to
see
me
or
write
to
me
till
mamma
has
arrived
she
and
papa
will
be
here
in
the
spring
quite
early
in
the
spring
we
hope
and
then
you
may
come
to
us
what
they
may
say
of
course
i
can
not
tell
but
i
shall
be
true
to
you
your
own
with
truest
affection
nora
of
course
you
knew
that
i
loved
you
and
i
do
think
that
you
are
a
conjuror
at
all
illustration
nora
letter
as
soon
as
ever
the
letter
was
written
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
forth
with
it
herself
to
the
trevelyan
stopped
her
on
the
stairs
and
endeavoured
to
detain
her
but
nora
would
not
be
detained
i
must
judge
for
myself
about
this
she
said
if
mamma
were
here
it
would
be
different
but
as
she
is
not
here
i
must
judge
for
myself
what
outhouse
might
have
done
had
she
been
at
home
at
the
time
it
would
be
useless
to
surmise
she
was
told
what
had
happened
when
it
occurred
and
questioned
nora
on
the
subject
i
thought
i
understood
from
you
she
said
with
something
of
severity
in
her
countenance
that
there
was
to
be
nothing
between
you
and
stanbury
at
any
rate
till
my
brother
came
home
i
never
pledged
myself
to
anything
of
the
kind
aunt
mary
nora
said
i
think
he
promised
that
he
would
not
come
here
and
i
suppose
that
he
means
to
come
if
he
should
do
so
i
shall
not
see
him
with
this
outhouse
was
obliged
to
be
content
the
letter
was
gone
and
could
not
be
stopped
nor
indeed
had
any
authority
been
delegated
to
her
by
which
she
would
have
been
justified
in
stopping
it
she
could
only
join
her
husband
in
wishing
that
they
both
might
be
relieved
as
soon
as
possible
from
the
terrible
burden
which
had
been
thrown
upon
them
i
call
it
very
hard
said
outhouse
very
hard
indeed
if
we
were
to
desire
them
to
leave
the
house
everybody
would
cry
out
upon
us
for
our
cruelty
and
yet
while
they
remain
here
they
will
submit
themselves
to
no
authority
as
far
as
i
can
see
they
may
both
of
them
do
just
what
they
please
and
we
ca
stop
it
chapter
liv
gibson
threat
miss
stanbury
for
a
long
time
persisted
in
being
neither
better
nor
worse
sir
peter
would
not
declare
her
state
to
be
precarious
nor
would
he
say
that
she
was
out
of
danger
and
martin
had
been
so
utterly
prostrated
by
the
effects
of
his
own
mistake
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
rally
himself
and
talk
on
the
subject
with
any
spirit
or
confidence
when
interrogated
he
would
simply
reply
that
sir
peter
said
this
and
sir
peter
said
that
and
thus
add
to
rather
than
diminish
the
doubt
and
excitement
and
varied
opinion
which
prevailed
through
the
city
on
one
morning
it
was
absolutely
asserted
within
the
limits
of
the
close
that
miss
stanbury
was
dying
and
it
was
believed
for
half
a
day
at
the
bank
that
she
was
then
lying
in
articulo
mortis
there
had
got
about
too
a
report
that
a
portion
of
the
property
had
only
been
left
to
miss
stanbury
for
her
life
that
the
burgesses
would
be
able
to
reclaim
the
houses
in
the
city
and
that
a
will
had
been
made
altogether
in
favour
of
dorothy
cutting
out
even
brooke
from
any
share
in
the
inheritance
and
thus
exeter
had
a
good
deal
to
say
respecting
the
affairs
and
state
of
health
of
our
old
friend
miss
illness
however
was
true
enough
she
was
much
too
ill
to
hear
anything
of
what
was
going
on
too
ill
to
allow
martha
to
talk
to
her
at
all
about
the
outside
public
when
the
invalid
herself
would
ask
questions
about
the
affairs
of
the
world
martha
would
be
very
discreet
and
turn
away
from
the
subject
miss
stanbury
for
instance
ill
as
she
was
exhibited
a
most
mundane
interest
not
exactly
in
camilla
french
marriage
but
in
the
delay
which
that
marriage
seemed
destined
to
encounter
i
dare
say
he
slip
out
of
it
yet
said
the
sick
lady
to
her
confidential
servant
then
martha
had
thought
it
right
to
change
the
subject
feeling
it
to
be
wrong
that
an
old
lady
on
her
should
be
taking
joy
in
the
disappointment
of
her
young
neighbour
martha
changed
the
subject
first
to
jelly
and
then
to
the
psalms
of
the
day
miss
stanbury
was
too
weak
to
resist
but
the
last
verse
of
the
last
psalm
of
the
evening
had
hardly
been
finished
before
she
remarked
that
she
would
never
believe
it
till
she
saw
it
it
all
in
the
hands
of
him
as
is
on
high
mum
said
martha
turning
her
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
and
closing
the
book
at
the
same
time
with
a
look
strongly
indicative
of
displeasure
miss
stanbury
understood
it
all
as
well
as
though
she
were
in
perfect
health
she
knew
her
own
failings
was
conscious
of
her
worldly
tendencies
and
perceived
that
her
old
servant
was
thinking
of
it
and
then
sundry
odd
thoughts
thoughts
ideas
too
difficult
for
her
present
strength
crossed
her
brain
had
it
been
wicked
of
her
when
she
was
well
to
hope
that
a
scheming
woman
should
not
succeed
in
betraying
a
man
by
her
schemes
into
an
marriage
and
if
not
wicked
then
was
it
wicked
now
because
she
was
ill
and
from
that
thought
her
mind
travelled
on
to
the
ordinary
practices
of
piety
could
an
assumed
devotion
be
of
use
to
her
now
such
a
devotion
as
martha
was
enjoining
upon
her
from
hour
to
hour
in
pure
and
affectionate
solicitude
for
her
soul
she
had
spoken
one
evening
of
a
game
of
cards
saying
that
a
game
of
cribbage
would
have
consoled
her
then
martha
with
a
shudder
had
suggested
a
hymn
and
had
had
recourse
at
once
to
a
sleeping
draught
miss
stanbury
had
submitted
but
had
understood
it
all
if
cards
were
wicked
she
had
indeed
been
a
terrible
sinner
what
hope
could
there
be
now
on
her
for
one
so
sinful
and
she
could
not
repent
of
her
cards
and
would
not
try
to
repent
of
them
not
seeing
the
evil
of
them
and
if
they
were
innocent
why
should
she
not
have
the
consolation
now
when
she
so
much
wanted
it
yet
she
knew
that
the
whole
household
even
dorothy
would
be
in
arms
against
her
were
she
to
suggest
such
a
thing
she
took
the
hymn
and
the
sleeping
draught
telling
herself
that
it
would
be
best
for
her
to
banish
such
ideas
from
her
mind
pastors
and
masters
had
laid
down
for
her
a
mode
of
living
which
she
had
followed
but
indifferently
perhaps
but
still
with
an
intention
of
obedience
they
had
also
laid
down
a
mode
of
dying
and
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
follow
that
as
closely
as
possible
she
would
say
nothing
more
about
cards
she
would
think
nothing
more
of
camilla
french
but
as
she
so
resolved
with
intellect
half
asleep
with
her
mind
wandering
between
fact
and
dream
she
was
unconsciously
comfortable
with
an
assurance
that
if
gibson
did
marry
camilla
french
camilla
french
would
lead
him
the
very
devil
of
a
life
during
three
days
dorothy
went
about
the
house
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
sitting
nightly
at
her
aunt
bedside
and
tending
the
sick
woman
with
the
closest
care
she
too
had
been
now
and
again
somewhat
startled
by
the
seeming
worldliness
of
her
aunt
in
her
illness
her
aunt
talked
to
her
about
rents
and
gave
her
messages
for
brooke
burgess
on
subjects
which
seemed
to
dorothy
to
be
profane
when
spoken
of
on
what
might
perhaps
be
a
and
this
struck
her
the
more
strongly
because
she
had
a
matter
of
her
own
on
which
she
would
have
much
wished
to
ascertain
her
aunt
opinion
if
she
had
not
thought
that
it
would
have
been
exceedingly
wrong
of
her
to
trouble
her
aunt
mind
at
such
a
time
by
any
such
matter
hitherto
she
had
said
not
a
word
of
brooke
proposal
to
any
living
being
at
present
it
was
a
secret
with
herself
but
a
secret
so
big
that
it
almost
caused
her
bosom
to
burst
with
the
load
that
it
bore
she
could
not
she
thought
write
to
priscilla
till
she
had
told
her
aunt
if
she
were
to
write
a
word
on
the
subject
to
any
one
she
could
not
fail
to
make
manifest
the
extreme
longing
of
her
own
heart
she
could
not
have
written
brooke
name
on
paper
in
reference
to
his
words
to
herself
without
covering
it
with
epithets
of
love
but
all
that
must
be
known
to
no
one
if
her
love
was
to
be
of
no
avail
to
her
and
she
had
an
idea
that
her
aunt
would
not
wish
brooke
to
marry
her
would
think
that
brooke
should
do
better
and
she
was
quite
clear
that
in
such
a
matter
as
this
her
aunt
wishes
must
be
law
had
not
her
aunt
the
power
of
disinheriting
brooke
altogether
and
what
then
if
her
aunt
should
die
should
die
now
leaving
brooke
at
liberty
to
do
as
he
pleased
there
was
something
so
distasteful
to
her
in
this
view
of
the
matter
that
she
would
not
look
at
it
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
think
of
any
success
which
might
possibly
accrue
to
herself
by
reason
of
her
aunt
death
intense
as
was
the
longing
in
her
heart
for
permission
from
those
in
authority
over
her
to
give
herself
to
brooke
burgess
perfect
as
was
the
earthly
paradise
which
appeared
to
be
open
to
her
when
she
thought
of
the
good
thing
which
had
befallen
her
in
that
matter
she
conceived
that
she
would
be
guilty
of
the
grossest
ingratitude
were
she
in
any
degree
to
curtail
even
her
own
estimate
of
her
aunt
prohibitory
powers
because
of
her
illness
the
remembrance
of
the
words
which
brooke
had
spoken
to
her
was
with
her
quite
perfect
she
was
entirely
conscious
of
the
joy
which
would
be
hers
if
she
might
accept
those
words
as
properly
sanctioned
but
she
was
a
creature
in
her
aunt
hands
according
to
her
own
ideas
of
her
own
duties
and
while
her
aunt
was
ill
she
could
not
even
learn
what
might
be
the
behests
which
she
would
be
called
on
to
obey
she
was
sitting
one
evening
alone
thinking
of
all
this
having
left
martha
with
her
aunt
and
was
trying
to
reconcile
the
circumstances
of
her
life
as
it
now
existed
with
the
circumstances
as
they
had
been
with
her
in
the
old
days
at
nuncombe
putney
wondering
at
herself
in
that
she
should
have
a
lover
and
trying
to
convince
herself
that
for
her
this
little
episode
of
romance
could
mean
nothing
serious
when
martha
crept
down
into
the
room
to
her
of
late
days
the
alteration
might
perhaps
be
dated
from
the
rejection
of
gibson
martha
who
had
always
been
very
kind
had
become
more
respectful
in
her
manner
to
dorothy
than
had
heretofore
been
usual
with
her
dorothy
was
quite
aware
of
it
and
was
not
unconscious
of
a
certain
rise
in
the
world
which
was
thereby
indicated
if
you
please
miss
said
martha
who
do
you
think
is
here
but
there
is
nobody
with
my
aunt
said
dorothy
she
is
sleeping
like
a
babby
and
i
came
down
just
for
a
moment
gibson
is
here
miss
in
the
house
he
asked
for
your
aunt
and
when
of
course
he
could
not
see
her
he
asked
for
you
dorothy
for
a
few
minutes
was
utterly
disconcerted
but
at
last
she
consented
to
see
gibson
i
think
it
is
best
said
martha
because
it
is
bad
to
be
fighting
and
missus
so
are
the
miss
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god
convinced
by
this
argument
or
by
the
working
of
her
own
mind
dorothy
directed
that
gibson
might
be
shewn
into
the
room
when
he
came
she
found
herself
unable
to
address
him
she
remembered
the
last
time
in
which
she
had
seen
him
and
was
lost
in
wonder
that
he
should
be
there
but
she
shook
hands
with
him
and
went
through
some
form
of
greeting
in
which
no
word
was
uttered
i
hope
you
will
not
think
that
i
have
done
wrong
said
he
in
calling
to
ask
after
my
old
friend
state
of
health
oh
dear
no
said
dorothy
quite
bewildered
i
have
known
her
for
so
very
long
miss
dorothy
that
now
in
the
hour
of
her
distress
and
perhaps
mortal
malady
i
can
not
stop
to
remember
the
few
harsh
words
that
she
spoke
to
me
lately
she
never
means
to
be
harsh
mr
gibson
ah
well
no
perhaps
not
at
any
rate
i
have
learned
to
forgive
and
forget
i
am
afraid
your
aunt
is
very
ill
miss
dorothy
she
is
ill
certainly
mr
gibson
dear
dear
we
are
all
as
the
grass
of
the
field
miss
dorothy
here
and
gone
as
sparks
fly
upwards
just
fit
to
be
cut
down
and
cast
into
the
oven
jennings
has
been
with
her
i
believe
jennings
was
the
other
minor
canon
he
comes
three
times
a
week
mr
gibson
he
is
an
excellent
young
man
a
very
good
young
man
it
has
been
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
have
jennings
with
me
but
he
very
young
miss
dorothy
is
he
dorothy
muttered
something
purporting
to
declare
that
she
was
not
acquainted
with
the
exact
circumstances
of
jennings
age
i
should
be
so
glad
to
come
if
my
old
friend
would
allow
me
said
gibson
almost
with
a
sigh
dorothy
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
any
change
at
the
present
would
be
bad
for
her
aunt
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
express
her
opinion
so
she
stood
silent
and
looked
at
him
there
need
be
a
word
spoken
you
know
about
the
ladies
at
heavitree
said
gibson
oh
dear
no
said
dorothy
and
yet
she
knew
well
that
there
would
be
such
words
spoken
if
gibson
were
to
make
his
way
into
her
aunt
room
her
aunt
was
constantly
alluding
to
the
ladies
at
heavitree
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
her
old
servant
to
restrain
her
there
was
some
little
misunderstanding
said
gibson
but
all
that
should
be
over
now
we
both
intended
for
the
best
miss
dorothy
and
i
sure
nobody
here
can
say
that
i
was
sincere
but
dorothy
though
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
answer
gibson
plainly
could
not
be
induced
to
assent
to
his
proposition
she
muttered
something
about
her
aunt
weakness
and
the
great
attention
which
jennings
shewed
her
aunt
had
become
very
fond
of
jennings
and
she
did
at
last
express
her
opinion
with
some
clearness
that
her
aunt
should
not
be
disturbed
by
any
changes
at
present
after
that
i
should
not
think
of
pressing
it
miss
dorothy
said
gibson
but
still
i
do
hope
that
i
may
have
the
privilege
of
seeing
her
yet
once
again
in
the
flesh
and
touching
my
approaching
marriage
miss
dorothy
he
paused
and
dorothy
felt
that
she
was
blushing
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
touching
my
marriage
continued
gibson
which
however
will
not
be
solemnized
till
the
end
of
march
it
was
manifest
that
he
regarded
this
as
a
point
that
would
in
that
household
be
regarded
as
an
argument
in
his
favour
i
do
hope
that
you
will
look
upon
it
in
the
most
favourable
light
and
your
excellent
aunt
also
if
she
be
spared
to
us
i
am
sure
we
hope
that
you
will
be
happy
mr
gibson
what
was
i
to
do
miss
dorothy
i
know
that
i
have
been
very
much
blamed
but
so
unfairly
i
have
never
meant
to
be
untrue
to
a
mouse
miss
dorothy
dorothy
did
not
at
all
understand
whether
she
were
the
mouse
or
camilla
french
or
arabella
and
it
is
so
hard
to
find
that
one
is
of
because
things
have
gone
a
little
amiss
it
was
quite
impossible
that
dorothy
should
make
any
answer
to
this
and
at
last
gibson
left
her
assuring
her
with
his
last
word
that
nothing
would
give
him
so
much
pleasure
as
to
be
called
upon
once
more
to
see
his
old
friend
in
her
last
moments
though
miss
stanbury
had
been
described
as
sleeping
like
a
babby
she
had
heard
the
footsteps
of
a
strange
man
in
the
house
and
had
made
martha
tell
her
whose
footsteps
they
were
as
soon
as
dorothy
went
to
her
she
darted
upon
the
subject
with
all
her
old
keenness
what
did
he
want
here
dolly
he
said
he
would
like
to
see
you
aunt
when
you
are
a
little
better
you
know
he
spoke
a
good
deal
of
his
old
friendship
and
respect
he
should
have
thought
of
that
before
how
am
i
to
see
people
now
but
when
you
are
better
aunt
how
do
i
know
that
i
shall
ever
be
better
he
is
off
with
those
people
at
heavitree
is
he
i
hope
not
aunt
psha
a
poor
weak
insufficient
creature
that
what
he
is
jennings
is
worth
twenty
of
him
dorothy
though
she
put
the
question
again
in
its
most
alluring
form
of
christian
charity
and
forgiveness
could
not
induce
her
aunt
to
say
that
she
would
see
gibson
how
can
i
see
him
when
you
know
that
sir
peter
has
forbidden
me
to
see
anybody
except
clifford
and
mr
jennings
two
days
afterwards
there
was
an
uncomfortable
little
scene
at
heavitree
it
must
no
doubt
have
been
the
case
that
the
same
train
of
circumstances
which
had
produced
gibson
visit
to
the
close
produced
also
the
scene
in
question
it
was
suggested
by
some
who
were
attending
closely
to
the
matter
that
gibson
had
already
come
to
repent
his
engagement
with
camilla
french
and
indeed
there
were
those
who
pretended
to
believe
that
he
was
induced
by
the
prospect
of
miss
stanbury
demise
to
transfer
his
allegiance
yet
again
and
to
bestow
his
hand
upon
dorothy
at
last
there
were
many
in
the
city
who
could
never
be
persuaded
that
dorothy
had
refused
him
these
being
for
the
most
part
ladies
in
whose
estimation
the
value
of
a
husband
was
counted
so
great
and
a
beneficed
clergyman
so
valuable
among
suitors
that
it
was
to
their
thinking
impossible
that
dorothy
stanbury
should
in
her
sound
senses
have
rejected
such
an
offer
i
do
believe
a
bit
of
it
said
crumbie
to
apjohn
is
it
likely
the
ears
of
all
the
french
family
were
keenly
alive
to
rumours
and
to
rumours
of
rumours
reports
of
these
opinions
respecting
gibson
reached
heavitree
and
had
their
effect
as
long
as
gibson
was
behaving
well
as
a
suitor
they
were
inoperative
there
what
did
it
matter
to
them
how
the
prize
might
have
been
struggled
for
might
still
be
struggled
for
elsewhere
while
they
enjoyed
the
consciousness
of
possession
but
when
the
consciousness
of
possession
became
marred
by
a
cankerous
doubt
such
rumours
were
very
important
camilla
heard
of
the
visit
in
the
close
and
swore
that
she
would
have
justice
done
her
she
gave
her
mother
to
understand
that
if
any
trick
were
played
upon
her
the
diocese
should
be
made
to
ring
of
it
in
a
fashion
that
would
astonish
them
all
from
the
bishop
downwards
whereupon
french
putting
much
faith
in
her
daughter
threats
sent
for
gibson
the
truth
is
gibson
said
french
when
the
civilities
of
their
first
greeting
had
been
completed
my
poor
child
is
pining
pining
mrs
french
yes
pining
gibson
i
am
afraid
that
you
little
understand
how
sensitive
is
that
young
heart
of
course
she
is
your
own
now
to
her
thinking
it
would
be
treason
to
you
for
her
to
indulge
in
conversation
with
any
other
gentleman
but
then
she
expects
that
you
should
spend
your
evenings
with
her
of
course
but
french
think
of
my
engagements
as
a
clergyman
we
know
all
about
that
gibson
we
know
what
a
clergyman
calls
are
it
is
like
a
doctor
mr
gibson
it
very
often
worse
mrs
french
why
should
you
go
calling
in
the
close
mr
gibson
here
was
the
gist
of
the
accusation
would
you
have
me
make
my
peace
with
a
poor
dying
sister
pleaded
gibson
after
what
has
occurred
said
french
shaking
her
head
at
him
and
while
things
are
just
as
they
are
now
it
would
be
more
like
an
honest
man
of
you
to
stay
away
and
of
course
camilla
feels
it
she
feels
it
very
much
and
she
wo
put
up
with
it
neither
i
think
this
is
the
cruellest
cruellest
thing
i
ever
heard
said
gibson
it
is
you
that
are
cruel
sir
then
the
wretched
man
turned
at
bay
i
tell
you
what
it
is
french
if
i
am
treated
in
this
way
i
wo
stand
it
i
wo
indeed
i
go
away
i
not
going
to
be
suspected
nor
yet
blown
up
i
think
i
behaved
handsomely
at
any
rate
to
camilla
quite
so
gibson
if
you
would
come
and
see
her
on
evenings
said
french
who
was
falling
back
into
her
usual
state
of
timidity
but
if
i
to
be
treated
in
this
way
i
will
go
away
i
thought
of
it
as
it
is
i
been
already
invited
to
go
to
natal
and
if
i
hear
anything
more
of
these
accusations
i
shall
certainly
make
up
my
mind
to
go
then
he
left
the
house
before
camilla
could
be
down
upon
him
from
her
perch
on
the
chapter
lv
the
republican
browning
glascock
had
returned
to
naples
after
his
sufferings
in
the
of
the
american
minister
and
by
the
middle
of
february
was
back
again
in
florence
his
father
was
still
alive
and
it
was
said
that
the
old
lord
would
now
probably
live
through
the
winter
and
it
was
understood
that
glascock
would
remain
in
italy
he
had
declared
that
he
would
pass
his
time
between
naples
rome
and
florence
but
it
seemed
to
his
friends
that
florence
was
of
the
three
the
most
to
his
taste
he
liked
his
room
he
said
at
the
york
hotel
and
he
liked
being
in
the
capital
that
was
his
own
statement
his
friends
said
that
he
liked
being
with
carry
spalding
the
daughter
of
the
american
minister
but
none
of
them
then
in
italy
were
sufficiently
intimate
with
him
to
express
that
opinion
to
himself
it
had
been
expressed
more
than
once
to
carry
spalding
the
world
in
general
says
such
things
to
ladies
more
openly
than
it
does
to
men
and
the
probability
of
a
girl
success
in
matrimony
is
canvassed
in
her
hearing
by
those
who
are
nearest
to
her
with
a
freedom
which
can
seldom
be
used
in
regard
to
a
man
a
man
most
intimate
friend
hardly
speaks
to
him
of
the
prospect
of
his
marriage
till
he
himself
has
told
that
the
engagement
exists
the
lips
of
no
living
person
had
suggested
to
glascock
that
the
american
girl
was
to
become
his
wife
but
a
great
deal
had
been
said
to
carry
spalding
about
the
conquest
she
had
made
her
uncle
her
aunt
her
sister
and
her
great
friend
miss
petrie
the
poetess
the
republican
browning
as
she
was
called
had
all
spoken
to
her
about
it
frequently
olivia
had
declared
her
conviction
that
the
thing
was
to
be
miss
petrie
had
with
considerable
eloquence
explained
to
her
friend
that
that
english
title
which
was
but
the
clatter
of
a
sounding
brass
should
be
regarded
as
a
drawback
rather
than
as
an
advantage
spalding
who
was
no
poetess
would
undoubtedly
have
welcomed
glascock
as
her
niece
husband
with
all
an
aunt
energy
when
told
by
miss
petrie
that
old
lord
peterborough
was
a
tinkling
cymbal
she
snapped
angrily
at
her
gifted
countrywoman
but
she
was
too
honest
a
woman
and
too
conscious
also
of
her
niece
strength
to
say
a
word
to
urge
her
on
spalding
as
an
american
minister
with
full
powers
at
the
court
of
a
european
sovereign
felt
that
he
had
full
as
much
to
give
as
to
receive
but
he
was
well
inclined
to
do
both
he
would
have
been
much
pleased
to
talk
about
his
nephew
lord
peterborough
and
he
loved
his
niece
dearly
but
by
the
middle
of
february
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
matter
had
been
long
enough
in
training
if
the
honourable
glascock
meant
anything
why
did
he
not
speak
out
his
mind
plainly
the
american
minister
in
such
matters
was
accustomed
to
fewer
ambages
than
were
common
in
the
circles
among
which
glascock
had
lived
in
the
meantime
caroline
spalding
was
suffering
she
had
allowed
herself
to
think
that
glascock
intended
to
propose
to
her
and
had
acknowledged
to
herself
that
were
he
to
do
so
she
would
certainly
accept
him
all
that
she
had
seen
of
him
since
the
day
on
which
he
had
been
courteous
to
her
about
the
seat
in
the
diligence
had
been
pleasant
to
her
she
had
felt
the
charm
of
his
manner
his
education
and
his
gentleness
and
had
told
herself
that
with
all
her
love
for
her
own
country
she
would
willingly
become
an
englishwoman
for
the
sake
of
being
that
man
wife
but
nevertheless
the
warnings
of
her
great
friend
the
poetess
had
not
been
thrown
away
upon
her
she
would
put
away
from
herself
as
far
as
she
could
any
desire
to
become
lady
peterborough
there
should
be
no
bias
in
the
man
favour
on
that
score
the
tinkling
cymbal
and
the
sounding
brass
should
be
nothing
to
her
but
yet
yet
what
a
chance
was
there
here
for
her
they
are
dishonest
and
rotten
at
the
core
said
miss
petrie
trying
to
make
her
friend
understand
that
a
free
american
should
under
no
circumstances
place
trust
in
an
english
aristocrat
their
country
carry
is
a
game
played
out
while
we
are
still
breasting
the
hill
with
our
young
lungs
full
of
air
carry
spalding
was
proud
of
her
intimacy
with
the
republican
browning
but
nevertheless
she
liked
glascock
and
when
glascock
had
been
ten
days
in
florence
on
his
third
visit
to
the
city
and
had
been
four
or
five
times
at
the
embassy
without
expressing
his
intentions
in
the
proper
form
carry
spalding
began
to
think
that
she
had
better
save
herself
from
a
heartbreak
while
salvation
might
be
within
her
reach
she
perceived
that
her
uncle
was
gloomy
and
almost
angry
when
he
spoke
of
glascock
and
that
her
aunt
was
fretful
with
disappointment
the
republican
browning
had
uttered
almost
a
note
of
triumph
and
had
it
not
been
that
olivia
persisted
carry
spalding
would
have
consented
to
go
away
with
miss
petrie
to
rome
the
old
stones
are
rotten
too
said
the
poetess
but
their
dust
tells
no
lies
that
well
known
piece
of
hers
ancient
marbles
while
ye
crumble
was
written
at
this
time
and
contained
an
occult
reference
to
glascock
and
her
friend
but
livy
spalding
clung
to
the
alliance
she
probably
knew
her
sister
heart
better
than
did
the
others
and
perhaps
also
had
a
clearer
insight
into
glascock
character
she
was
at
any
rate
clearly
of
opinion
that
there
should
be
no
running
away
either
you
do
like
him
or
you
do
if
you
do
what
are
you
to
get
by
going
to
rome
said
livy
i
shall
get
quit
of
doubt
and
trouble
i
call
that
cowardice
i
would
never
run
away
from
a
man
carry
aunt
sophie
forgets
that
they
do
manage
these
things
in
england
just
as
we
do
i
do
know
why
there
should
be
a
difference
nor
do
i
only
that
there
is
you
have
read
so
many
of
their
novels
as
i
have
who
would
ever
think
of
learning
to
live
out
of
an
english
novel
said
carry
i
am
not
saying
that
you
may
teach
him
to
live
how
you
like
afterwards
but
if
you
have
anything
to
do
with
people
it
must
be
well
to
know
what
their
manners
are
i
think
the
richer
sort
of
people
in
england
slide
into
these
things
more
gradually
than
we
do
you
stand
your
ground
carry
and
hold
your
own
and
take
the
goods
the
gods
provide
you
though
caroline
spalding
opposed
her
arguments
and
was
particularly
hard
upon
that
allusion
to
the
richer
sort
of
people
which
as
she
knew
miss
petrie
would
have
regarded
as
evidence
of
reverence
for
sounding
brasses
and
tinkling
cymbals
nevertheless
she
loved
livy
dearly
for
what
she
said
and
kissed
the
sweet
counsellor
and
resolved
that
she
would
for
the
present
decline
the
invitation
of
the
poetess
then
was
miss
petrie
somewhat
indignant
with
her
friend
and
threw
out
her
scorn
in
those
lines
which
have
been
mentioned
but
the
american
minister
hardly
knew
how
to
behave
himself
when
he
met
glascock
or
even
when
he
was
called
upon
to
speak
of
him
florence
no
doubt
is
a
large
city
and
is
now
the
capital
of
a
great
kingdom
but
still
people
meet
in
florence
much
more
frequently
than
they
do
in
paris
or
in
london
it
may
almost
be
said
that
they
whose
habit
it
is
to
go
into
society
and
whose
circumstances
bring
them
into
the
same
circles
will
see
each
other
every
day
now
the
american
minister
delighted
to
see
and
to
be
seen
in
all
places
frequented
by
persons
of
a
certain
rank
and
position
in
florence
having
considered
the
matter
much
he
had
convinced
himself
that
he
could
thus
best
do
his
duty
as
minister
from
the
great
republic
of
free
states
to
the
newest
and
as
he
called
it
the
of
the
european
kingdoms
the
minister
from
france
was
a
marquis
he
from
england
was
an
earl
from
spain
had
come
a
count
and
so
on
in
the
domestic
privacy
of
his
embassy
spalding
would
be
severe
enough
upon
the
sounding
brasses
and
the
tinkling
cymbals
and
was
quite
content
himself
to
be
the
honourable
jonas
spalding
honourable
because
selected
by
his
country
for
a
post
of
honour
but
he
liked
to
be
heard
among
the
cymbals
and
seen
among
the
brasses
and
to
feel
that
his
position
was
as
high
as
theirs
glascock
also
was
frequently
in
the
same
circles
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
two
gentlemen
saw
each
other
almost
daily
that
spalding
knew
well
how
to
bear
himself
in
his
high
place
no
one
could
doubt
but
he
did
not
quite
know
how
to
carry
himself
before
glascock
at
home
at
boston
he
would
have
been
more
completely
master
of
the
situation
he
thought
too
that
he
began
to
perceive
that
glascock
avoided
him
though
he
would
hear
on
his
return
home
that
that
gentleman
had
been
at
the
embassy
or
had
been
walking
in
the
cascine
with
his
nieces
that
their
young
ladies
should
walk
in
public
places
with
unmarried
gentlemen
is
nothing
to
american
fathers
and
guardians
american
young
ladies
are
accustomed
to
choose
their
own
companions
but
the
minister
was
tormented
by
his
doubts
as
to
the
ways
of
englishmen
and
as
to
the
phase
in
which
english
habits
might
most
properly
exhibit
themselves
in
italy
he
knew
that
people
were
talking
about
glascock
and
his
niece
why
then
did
glascock
avoid
him
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
spalding
should
have
omitted
to
observe
that
glascock
was
not
delighted
by
those
lectures
on
the
american
constitution
which
formed
so
large
a
part
of
his
ordinary
conversation
with
englishmen
it
happened
one
afternoon
that
they
were
thrown
together
so
closely
for
nearly
an
hour
that
neither
could
avoid
the
other
they
were
both
at
the
old
palace
in
which
the
italian
parliament
is
held
and
were
kept
waiting
during
some
long
delay
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
place
they
were
seated
next
to
each
other
and
during
such
delay
there
was
nothing
for
them
but
to
talk
on
the
other
side
of
each
of
them
was
a
stranger
and
not
to
talk
in
such
circumstances
would
be
to
quarrel
glascock
began
by
asking
after
the
ladies
they
are
quite
well
sir
thank
you
said
the
minister
i
hope
that
lord
peterborough
was
pretty
well
when
last
you
heard
from
naples
mr
glascock
glascock
explained
that
his
condition
was
not
much
altered
and
then
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
your
nieces
will
remain
with
you
through
the
spring
i
suppose
said
glascock
such
is
their
intention
sir
they
seem
to
like
florence
i
think
yes
yes
i
think
they
do
like
florence
they
see
this
capital
sir
perhaps
under
more
favourable
circumstances
than
are
accorded
to
most
of
my
countrywomen
our
republican
simplicity
glascock
has
this
drawback
that
away
from
home
it
subjects
us
somewhat
to
the
cold
shade
of
unobserved
obscurity
that
it
possesses
merits
which
much
more
than
compensate
for
this
trifling
evil
i
should
be
the
last
man
in
europe
to
deny
it
is
to
be
observed
that
american
citizens
are
always
prone
to
talk
of
europe
it
affords
the
best
counterpoise
they
know
to
that
other
term
america
and
america
and
the
united
states
are
of
course
the
same
to
speak
of
france
or
of
england
as
weighing
equally
against
their
own
country
seems
to
an
american
to
be
an
absurdity
and
almost
an
insult
to
himself
with
europe
he
can
compare
himself
but
even
this
is
done
generally
in
the
style
of
the
republican
browning
when
she
addressed
the
ancient
marbles
undoubtedly
said
glascock
the
family
of
a
minister
abroad
has
great
advantages
in
seeing
the
country
to
which
he
is
accredited
that
is
my
meaning
sir
but
as
i
was
remarking
we
carry
with
us
as
a
people
no
external
symbols
of
our
standing
at
home
the
wives
and
daughters
sir
of
the
most
honoured
of
our
citizens
have
no
nomenclature
different
from
that
which
belongs
to
the
least
noted
among
us
it
is
perhaps
a
consequence
of
this
that
europeans
who
are
accustomed
in
their
social
intercourse
to
the
assistance
of
titles
will
not
always
trouble
themselves
to
inquire
who
and
what
are
the
american
citizens
who
may
sit
opposite
to
them
at
table
i
have
known
glascock
the
wife
and
daughter
of
a
gentleman
who
has
been
thrice
sent
as
senator
from
his
native
state
to
washington
to
remain
as
disregarded
in
the
intercourse
of
a
european
city
as
though
they
had
formed
part
of
the
family
of
some
grocer
from
your
russell
square
let
the
miss
spaldings
go
where
they
will
said
glascock
they
will
not
fare
in
that
way
the
miss
spaldings
sir
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
the
minister
with
a
bow
i
regard
it
as
one
of
the
luckiest
chances
of
my
life
that
i
was
thrown
in
with
them
at
michael
as
i
was
said
glascock
with
something
like
warmth
i
am
sure
sir
they
will
never
forget
the
courtesy
displayed
by
you
on
that
occasion
said
the
minister
bowing
again
that
was
a
matter
of
course
i
and
my
friend
would
have
done
the
same
for
the
grocer
wife
and
daughter
of
whom
you
spoke
little
services
such
as
that
do
not
come
from
appreciation
of
merit
but
are
simply
the
payment
of
the
debt
due
by
all
men
to
all
women
such
is
certainly
the
rule
of
living
in
our
country
sir
said
spalding
the
chances
are
continued
the
englishman
that
no
further
observation
follows
the
payment
of
such
a
debt
it
has
been
a
thing
of
course
we
delight
to
think
it
so
glascock
in
our
own
cities
but
in
this
instance
it
has
given
rise
to
one
of
the
pleasantest
and
as
i
hope
most
enduring
friendships
that
i
have
ever
formed
said
glascock
with
enthusiasm
what
could
the
american
minister
do
but
bow
again
three
times
and
what
other
meaning
could
he
attach
to
such
words
than
that
which
so
many
of
his
friends
had
been
attributing
to
glascock
for
some
weeks
past
it
had
occurred
to
spalding
even
since
he
had
been
sitting
in
his
present
close
proximity
to
glascock
that
it
might
possibly
be
his
duty
as
an
uncle
having
to
deal
with
an
englishman
to
ask
that
gentleman
what
were
his
intentions
he
would
do
his
duty
let
it
be
what
it
might
but
the
asking
of
such
a
question
would
be
very
disagreeable
to
him
for
the
present
he
satisfied
himself
with
inviting
his
neighbour
to
come
and
drink
tea
with
spalding
on
the
next
evening
but
one
the
girls
will
be
delighted
i
am
sure
said
he
thinking
himself
to
be
justified
in
this
friendly
familiarity
by
enthusiasm
for
spalding
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
let
the
value
of
republican
simplicity
be
what
it
might
an
alliance
with
the
crumbling
marbles
of
europe
would
in
his
niece
circumstances
be
not
inexpedient
glascock
accepted
the
invitation
with
alacrity
and
the
minister
when
he
was
closeted
with
his
wife
that
evening
declared
his
opinion
that
after
all
the
britisher
meant
fighting
the
aunt
told
the
girls
that
glascock
was
coming
and
in
order
that
it
might
not
seem
that
a
net
was
being
specially
spread
for
him
others
were
invited
to
join
the
party
miss
petrie
consented
to
be
there
and
the
italian
count
buonarosci
to
whose
presence
though
she
could
not
speak
to
him
spalding
was
becoming
accustomed
it
was
painful
to
her
to
feel
that
she
could
not
communicate
with
those
around
her
and
for
that
reason
she
would
have
avoided
italians
but
she
had
an
idea
that
she
could
not
thoroughly
realise
the
advantages
of
foreign
travel
unless
she
lived
with
foreigners
and
therefore
she
was
glad
to
become
intimate
at
any
rate
with
the
outside
of
count
buonarosci
i
think
your
uncle
is
wrong
dear
said
miss
petrie
early
in
the
day
to
her
friend
but
why
he
has
done
nothing
more
than
what
is
just
civil
if
glascock
kept
a
store
in
broadway
he
would
not
have
thought
it
necessary
to
shew
the
same
civility
yes
if
we
all
liked
the
glascock
who
kept
the
store
caroline
said
the
poetess
with
severe
eloquence
can
you
put
your
hand
upon
your
heart
and
say
that
this
inherited
title
this
tinkling
cymbal
as
i
call
it
has
no
attraction
for
you
or
yours
is
it
the
unadorned
simple
man
that
you
welcome
to
your
bosom
or
a
thing
of
stars
and
garters
a
patch
of
parchment
the
minion
of
a
throne
the
lordling
of
twenty
descents
in
which
each
has
been
weaker
than
that
before
it
the
hero
of
a
scutcheon
whose
glory
is
in
his
quarterings
and
whose
worldly
wealth
comes
from
the
sweat
of
serfs
whom
the
euphonism
of
an
effete
country
has
learned
to
decorate
with
the
name
of
tenants
but
caroline
spalding
had
a
spirit
of
her
own
and
had
already
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
be
talked
down
by
miss
petrie
uncle
jonas
said
she
asks
him
because
we
like
him
and
would
do
so
too
if
he
kept
the
store
in
broadway
but
if
he
did
keep
the
store
perhaps
we
should
not
like
him
i
trow
not
said
miss
petrie
livy
was
much
more
comfortable
in
her
tactics
and
without
consulting
anybody
sent
for
a
hairdresser
it
all
very
well
for
wallachia
said
livy
miss
petrie
name
was
wallachia
but
i
know
a
nice
sort
of
man
when
i
see
him
and
the
ways
of
the
world
are
not
to
be
altered
because
wally
writes
poetry
when
glascock
was
announced
spalding
handsome
rooms
were
almost
filled
as
rooms
in
florence
are
filled
obstruction
in
every
avenue
a
crowd
in
every
corner
and
a
block
at
every
doorway
not
being
among
the
customs
of
the
place
spalding
immediately
caught
him
intercepting
him
between
the
passages
and
the
ladies
and
engaged
him
at
once
in
conversation
your
john
mill
is
a
great
man
said
the
minister
they
tell
me
so
said
glascock
i
do
read
what
he
writes
myself
this
acknowledgment
seemed
to
the
minister
to
be
almost
disgraceful
and
yet
he
himself
had
never
read
a
word
of
mill
writings
he
is
a
man
continued
the
minister
he
is
one
of
the
few
europeans
who
can
look
forward
and
see
how
the
rivers
of
civilization
are
running
on
he
has
understood
that
women
must
at
last
be
put
upon
an
equality
with
men
can
he
manage
that
men
shall
have
half
the
babies
said
glascock
thinking
to
escape
by
an
attempt
at
playfulness
but
the
minister
was
down
upon
him
at
once
had
him
by
the
lappet
of
his
coat
though
he
knew
how
important
it
was
for
his
dear
niece
that
he
should
allow
glascock
to
amuse
himself
this
evening
after
another
fashion
i
have
an
answer
ready
sir
for
that
difficulty
he
said
step
aside
with
me
for
a
moment
the
question
is
important
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
communicate
my
ideas
to
your
great
philosopher
nature
sir
has
laid
down
certain
laws
which
are
immutable
and
against
them
but
glascock
had
not
come
to
florence
for
this
there
were
circumstances
in
his
present
position
which
made
him
feel
that
he
would
be
gratified
in
escaping
even
at
the
cost
of
some
seeming
incivility
i
must
go
in
to
the
ladies
at
once
he
said
or
i
shall
never
get
a
word
with
them
there
came
across
the
brow
a
momentary
frown
of
displeasure
as
though
he
felt
that
he
were
being
robbed
of
that
which
was
justly
his
own
for
an
instant
his
grasp
fixed
itself
more
tightly
to
the
coat
it
was
quite
within
the
scope
of
his
courage
to
hold
a
struggling
listener
by
physical
strength
but
he
remembered
that
there
was
a
purpose
and
he
relaxed
his
hold
i
will
take
another
opportunity
said
the
minister
as
you
have
raised
that
somewhat
trite
objection
of
the
bearing
of
children
which
we
in
our
country
sir
have
altogether
got
over
i
must
put
you
in
possession
of
my
views
on
that
subject
but
i
will
find
another
occasion
then
glascock
began
to
reflect
whether
an
american
lady
married
in
england
would
probably
want
to
see
much
of
her
uncle
in
her
adopted
country
spalding
was
all
smiles
when
her
guest
reached
her
we
did
not
mean
to
have
such
a
crowd
of
people
she
said
whispering
but
you
know
how
one
thing
leads
to
another
and
people
here
really
like
short
invitations
then
the
minister
wife
bowed
very
low
to
an
italian
lady
and
for
the
moment
wished
herself
in
beacon
street
it
was
a
great
trouble
to
her
that
she
could
not
pluck
up
courage
to
speak
a
word
in
italian
i
know
more
about
it
than
some
that
are
glib
enough
she
would
say
to
her
niece
livy
but
these
tuscans
are
so
particular
with
their
bocca
toscana
it
was
almost
spiteful
on
the
part
of
miss
petrie
the
manner
in
which
on
this
evening
she
remained
close
to
her
friend
caroline
spalding
it
is
hardly
possible
to
believe
that
it
came
altogether
from
high
principle
from
a
determination
to
save
her
friend
from
an
impending
danger
one
friend
has
no
right
to
decide
for
one
what
is
and
what
is
not
dangerous
glascock
after
awhile
found
himself
seated
on
a
fixed
couch
that
ran
along
the
wall
between
carry
spalding
and
miss
petrie
but
miss
petrie
was
almost
as
bad
to
him
as
had
been
the
minister
himself
i
am
afraid
she
said
looking
up
into
his
face
with
some
severity
and
rushing
upon
her
subject
with
audacity
that
the
works
of
your
browning
have
not
been
received
in
your
country
with
that
veneration
to
which
they
are
entitled
do
you
mean
or
mrs
browning
asked
glascock
perhaps
with
some
mistaken
idea
that
the
lady
was
out
of
her
depth
and
did
not
know
the
difference
either
both
for
they
are
one
the
same
and
indivisible
the
spirit
and
germ
of
each
is
so
reflected
in
the
outcome
of
the
other
that
one
sees
only
the
result
of
so
perfect
a
combination
and
one
is
tempted
to
acknowledge
that
here
and
there
a
marriage
may
have
been
arranged
in
heaven
i
do
think
that
in
your
country
you
have
perceived
this
mr
glascock
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
we
have
said
glascock
yours
is
not
altogether
an
inglorious
mission
continued
miss
petrie
i
got
no
mission
said
glascock
either
from
the
foreign
office
or
from
my
own
inner
convictions
miss
petrie
laughed
with
a
scornful
laugh
i
spoke
sir
of
the
mission
of
that
small
speck
on
the
earth
broad
surface
of
which
you
think
so
much
and
which
we
call
great
britain
i
do
think
a
good
deal
of
it
said
glascock
it
has
been
more
thought
of
than
any
other
speck
of
the
same
size
said
carry
spalding
true
said
miss
petrie
sharply
because
of
its
iron
and
coal
but
the
mission
i
spoke
of
was
this
and
she
put
forth
her
hand
with
an
artistic
motion
as
she
spoke
it
utters
prophecies
though
it
can
not
read
them
it
sends
forth
truth
though
it
can
not
understand
it
though
its
own
ears
are
deaf
as
adders
it
is
the
nursery
of
poets
who
sing
not
for
their
own
countrymen
but
for
the
higher
sensibilities
and
newer
intelligences
of
lands
in
which
philanthropy
has
made
education
as
common
as
the
air
that
is
breathed
wally
said
olivia
coming
up
to
the
poetess
in
anger
that
was
almost
apparent
i
want
to
take
you
and
introduce
you
to
the
marchesa
pulti
but
miss
petrie
no
doubt
knew
that
the
eldest
son
of
an
english
lord
was
at
least
as
good
as
an
italian
marchesa
let
her
come
here
said
the
poetess
with
her
grandest
smile
chapter
lvi
withered
grass
illustration
when
caroline
spalding
perceived
how
direct
an
attempt
had
been
made
by
her
sister
to
take
the
poetess
away
in
order
that
she
might
thus
be
left
alone
with
glascock
her
spirit
revolted
against
the
manoeuvre
and
she
took
herself
away
amidst
the
crowd
if
glascock
should
wish
to
find
her
again
he
could
do
so
and
there
came
across
her
mind
something
of
a
idea
that
perhaps
after
all
her
friend
wallachia
was
right
were
this
man
ready
to
take
her
and
she
ready
to
be
taken
would
such
an
arrangement
be
a
happy
one
for
both
of
them
his
wealthy
friends
might
very
probably
despise
her
and
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
also
might
despise
them
to
be
lady
peterborough
and
have
the
spending
of
a
large
fortune
would
not
suffice
for
her
happiness
she
was
sure
of
that
it
would
be
a
leap
in
the
dark
and
all
such
leaps
must
needs
be
dangerous
and
therefore
should
be
avoided
but
she
did
like
the
man
her
friend
was
untrue
to
her
and
cruel
in
those
allusions
to
tinkling
cymbals
it
might
be
well
for
her
to
get
over
her
liking
and
to
think
no
more
of
one
who
was
to
her
a
foreigner
and
a
stranger
of
whose
ways
of
living
in
his
own
home
she
knew
so
little
whose
people
might
be
antipathetic
to
her
enemies
instead
of
friends
among
whom
her
life
would
be
one
long
misery
but
it
was
not
on
that
ground
that
miss
petrie
had
recommended
her
to
start
for
rome
as
soon
as
glascock
had
reached
florence
there
is
no
reason
she
said
to
herself
why
i
should
not
marry
a
man
if
i
like
him
even
though
he
be
a
lord
and
of
him
i
should
not
be
the
least
afraid
it
the
women
that
i
fear
and
then
she
called
to
mind
all
that
she
had
ever
heard
of
english
countesses
and
duchesses
she
thought
that
she
knew
that
they
were
generally
cold
and
proud
and
very
little
given
to
receive
outsiders
graciously
within
their
ranks
glascock
had
an
aunt
who
was
a
duchess
and
a
sister
who
would
be
a
countess
caroline
spalding
felt
how
her
back
would
rise
against
these
new
relations
if
it
should
come
to
pass
that
they
should
look
unkindly
upon
her
when
she
was
taken
to
her
own
home
how
she
would
fight
with
them
giving
them
scorn
for
scorn
how
unutterably
miserable
she
would
be
how
she
would
long
to
be
back
among
her
own
equals
in
spite
even
of
her
love
for
her
husband
how
grand
a
thing
it
is
she
said
to
be
equal
with
those
whom
you
love
and
yet
she
was
to
some
extent
allured
by
the
social
position
of
the
man
she
could
perceive
that
he
had
a
charm
of
manner
which
her
countrymen
lacked
he
had
read
perhaps
less
than
her
uncle
knew
perhaps
less
than
most
of
those
men
with
whom
she
had
been
wont
to
associate
in
her
own
city
life
at
home
was
not
braver
or
more
virtuous
or
more
than
they
but
there
was
a
softness
and
an
ease
in
his
manner
which
was
palatable
to
her
and
an
absence
of
that
too
visible
effort
of
the
intellect
which
is
so
apt
to
mark
and
mar
the
conversation
of
americans
she
almost
wished
that
she
had
been
english
in
order
that
the
man
home
and
friends
might
have
suited
her
she
was
thinking
of
all
this
as
she
stood
pretending
to
talk
to
an
american
lady
who
was
very
eloquent
on
the
delights
of
florence
in
the
meantime
olivia
and
glascock
had
moved
away
together
and
miss
petrie
was
left
alone
this
was
no
injury
to
miss
petrie
as
her
mind
at
once
set
itself
to
work
on
a
sonnet
touching
the
frivolity
of
modern
social
gatherings
and
when
she
complained
afterwards
to
caroline
that
it
was
the
curse
of
their
mode
of
life
that
no
moment
could
be
allowed
for
thought
in
which
she
referred
specially
to
a
few
words
that
gore
had
addressed
to
her
at
this
moment
of
her
meditations
she
was
not
wilfully
a
hypocrite
she
was
painfully
turning
her
second
set
of
rhymes
and
really
believed
that
she
had
been
subjected
to
a
hardship
in
the
meantime
olivia
and
glascock
were
discussing
her
at
a
distance
you
were
being
put
through
your
facings
glascock
olivia
had
said
well
yes
and
your
dear
friend
miss
petrie
is
rather
a
stern
examiner
she
is
carry
ally
not
mine
said
olivia
then
she
remembered
that
by
saying
this
she
might
be
doing
her
sister
an
injury
glascock
might
object
to
such
a
bosom
friend
for
his
wife
that
is
to
say
of
course
we
are
all
intimate
with
her
but
just
at
this
moment
carry
is
most
in
favour
she
is
very
clever
i
am
quite
sure
said
he
oh
yes
she
a
genius
you
must
not
doubt
that
on
the
peril
of
making
every
american
in
italy
your
enemy
she
is
a
poet
is
she
not
mr
glascock
have
i
said
anything
wrong
he
asked
do
you
mean
to
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
me
that
you
are
not
acquainted
with
her
works
that
you
do
know
pages
of
them
by
heart
that
you
do
sleep
with
them
under
your
pillow
do
travel
about
with
them
in
your
i
afraid
we
have
mistaken
you
mr
glascock
is
it
so
great
a
sin
if
you
own
up
honestly
i
tell
you
something
in
a
whisper
you
have
not
read
a
word
of
her
poems
not
a
word
neither
have
i
is
it
horrible
but
perhaps
if
i
heard
tennyson
talking
every
day
i
should
read
tennyson
familiarity
does
breed
contempt
does
it
and
then
poor
dear
wallachia
is
such
a
bore
i
sometimes
wonder
when
english
people
are
listening
to
her
whether
they
think
that
american
girls
generally
talk
like
that
not
all
perhaps
with
that
perfected
eloquence
i
dare
say
you
do
continued
olivia
craftily
that
is
just
the
way
in
which
people
form
their
opinions
about
foreigners
some
specially
american
speaks
his
mind
louder
than
other
people
and
then
you
say
that
all
americans
are
but
you
are
a
little
that
way
given
miss
spalding
because
we
are
always
called
upon
to
answer
accusations
against
us
expressed
or
unexpressed
we
do
think
ourselves
a
bit
better
than
you
or
if
the
truth
were
known
half
as
good
we
are
always
struggling
to
be
as
polished
and
easy
as
the
french
or
as
sensible
and
dignified
as
the
english
but
when
our
defects
are
thrown
in
our
teeth
who
throws
them
in
your
teeth
miss
spalding
you
look
it
all
of
you
if
you
do
not
speak
it
out
you
do
assume
a
superiority
glascock
and
that
we
can
not
endure
i
do
not
feel
that
i
assume
anything
said
glascock
meekly
if
three
gentlemen
be
together
an
englishman
a
frenchman
and
an
american
is
not
the
american
obliged
to
be
on
his
mettle
to
prove
that
he
is
somebody
among
the
three
i
admit
that
he
is
always
claiming
to
be
the
first
but
he
does
so
only
that
he
may
not
be
too
evidently
the
last
if
you
knew
us
glascock
you
would
find
us
to
be
very
mild
and
humble
and
nice
and
good
and
clever
and
kind
and
charitable
and
beautiful
in
short
the
finest
people
that
have
as
yet
been
created
on
the
broad
face
of
god
smiling
earth
these
last
words
she
pronounced
with
a
nasal
twang
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
almost
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
direct
mimicry
of
the
american
minister
the
upshot
of
the
conversation
however
was
that
the
disgust
against
americans
which
to
a
certain
degree
had
been
excited
in
glascock
mind
by
the
united
efforts
of
spalding
and
the
poetess
had
been
almost
entirely
dispelled
from
all
of
which
the
reader
ought
to
understand
that
miss
olivia
spalding
was
a
very
clever
young
woman
but
nevertheless
glascock
had
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
the
elder
sister
to
be
his
wife
he
was
one
of
those
men
to
whom
does
not
come
very
easy
although
he
was
never
so
much
at
his
ease
as
when
he
was
in
company
with
ladies
he
was
sorely
in
want
of
a
wife
but
he
was
aware
that
at
different
periods
during
the
last
fifteen
years
he
had
been
angled
for
as
a
fish
mothers
in
england
had
tried
to
catch
him
and
of
such
mothers
he
had
come
to
have
the
strongest
possible
detestation
he
had
seen
the
hooks
or
perhaps
had
fancied
that
he
saw
them
when
they
were
not
there
lady
janes
and
lady
sarahs
had
been
hard
upon
him
till
he
learned
to
buckle
himself
into
triple
armour
when
he
went
amongst
them
and
yet
he
wanted
a
wife
no
man
more
sorely
wanted
one
the
reader
will
perhaps
remember
how
he
went
down
to
nuncombe
putney
in
quest
of
a
wife
but
all
in
vain
the
lady
in
that
case
had
been
so
explicit
with
him
that
he
could
not
hope
for
a
more
favourable
answer
and
indeed
he
would
not
have
cared
to
marry
a
girl
who
had
told
him
that
she
preferred
another
man
to
himself
even
if
it
had
been
possible
for
him
to
do
so
now
he
had
met
a
lady
very
different
from
those
with
whom
he
had
hitherto
associated
but
not
the
less
manifestly
a
lady
caroline
spalding
was
bright
pleasant
attractive
very
easy
to
talk
to
and
yet
quite
able
to
hold
her
own
but
the
american
minister
was
a
bore
and
miss
petrie
was
unbearable
he
had
often
told
himself
that
in
this
matter
of
marrying
a
wife
he
would
please
himself
altogether
that
he
would
allow
himself
to
be
tied
down
by
no
consideration
of
family
pride
that
he
would
consult
nothing
but
his
own
heart
and
feelings
as
for
rank
he
could
give
that
to
his
wife
as
for
money
he
had
plenty
of
that
also
he
wanted
a
woman
that
was
not
blasée
with
the
world
that
was
not
a
fool
and
who
would
respect
him
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
sure
he
was
that
he
had
seen
none
who
pleased
him
so
well
as
caroline
spalding
and
yet
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
taking
a
step
that
would
be
irrevocable
perhaps
the
american
minister
might
express
a
wish
to
end
his
days
at
monkhams
and
might
think
it
desirable
to
have
miss
petrie
always
with
him
as
a
private
secretary
in
poetry
between
you
and
us
glascock
the
spark
of
sympathy
does
not
pass
with
a
strong
flash
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
as
he
turned
round
rapidly
to
face
his
foe
he
was
quite
sure
for
the
moment
that
under
no
possible
circumstances
would
he
ever
take
an
american
woman
to
his
bosom
as
his
wife
no
said
he
no
no
i
rather
think
that
i
agree
with
you
the
antipathy
is
one
continued
miss
petrie
which
has
been
common
on
the
face
of
the
earth
since
the
clown
first
trod
upon
the
courtier
heels
it
is
the
instinct
of
fallen
man
to
hate
equality
to
desire
ascendancy
to
crush
to
oppress
to
tyrannise
to
enslave
then
when
the
slave
is
at
last
free
and
in
his
freedom
demands
equality
man
is
not
great
enough
to
take
his
enfranchised
brother
to
his
bosom
you
mean
negroes
said
glascock
looking
round
and
planning
for
himself
a
mode
of
escape
not
negroes
only
not
the
enslaved
blacks
who
are
now
enslaved
no
more
but
the
rising
nations
of
white
men
wherever
they
are
to
be
seen
you
english
have
no
sympathy
with
a
people
who
claim
to
be
at
least
your
equals
the
clown
has
trod
upon
the
courtier
heels
till
the
clown
is
clown
no
longer
and
the
courtier
has
hardly
a
court
in
which
he
may
dangle
his
if
so
the
clown
might
as
well
spare
the
courtier
not
meaning
the
rebuke
which
his
words
implied
ah
h
but
the
clown
will
not
spare
the
courtier
glascock
i
understand
the
gibe
and
i
tell
you
that
the
courtier
shall
be
spared
no
longer
because
he
is
useless
he
shall
be
cut
down
together
with
the
withered
grasses
and
thrown
into
the
oven
and
there
shall
be
an
end
of
him
then
she
turned
round
to
appeal
to
an
american
gentleman
who
had
joined
them
and
glascock
made
his
escape
i
hold
it
to
be
the
holiest
duty
which
i
owe
to
my
country
never
to
spare
one
of
them
when
i
meet
him
they
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
said
the
american
gentleman
down
with
them
down
with
them
exclaimed
the
poetess
with
a
beautiful
enthusiasm
in
the
meantime
glascock
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
not
dare
to
ask
caroline
spalding
to
be
his
wife
there
were
certain
forms
of
the
american
female
so
dreadful
that
no
wise
man
would
wilfully
come
in
contact
with
them
miss
ferocity
was
distressing
to
him
but
her
eloquence
and
enthusiasm
were
worse
even
than
her
ferocity
the
personal
incivility
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
in
calling
him
a
withered
grass
was
distasteful
to
him
as
being
opposed
to
his
ideas
of
the
customs
of
society
but
what
would
be
his
fate
if
his
wife
chosen
friend
should
be
for
ever
dinning
her
denunciation
of
withered
grasses
into
his
ear
he
was
still
thinking
of
all
this
when
he
was
accosted
by
spalding
are
you
going
to
dear
lady
banbury
she
asked
lady
banbury
was
the
wife
of
the
english
minister
i
suppose
i
shall
be
there
in
the
course
of
the
evening
how
very
nice
she
is
is
she
not
i
do
like
lady
banbury
so
soft
and
gentle
and
kind
one
of
the
pleasantest
old
ladies
i
know
said
glascock
it
does
not
strike
you
so
much
as
it
does
me
said
spalding
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
the
truth
is
we
all
value
what
we
have
not
got
there
are
no
lady
banburys
in
our
country
and
therefore
we
think
the
more
of
them
when
we
meet
them
here
she
is
talking
of
going
to
rome
for
the
carnival
and
has
asked
caroline
to
go
with
her
i
am
so
pleased
to
find
that
my
dear
girl
is
such
a
favourite
glascock
immediately
told
himself
that
he
saw
the
hook
if
he
were
to
be
fished
for
by
this
american
aunt
as
he
had
been
fished
for
by
english
mothers
all
his
pleasure
in
the
society
of
caroline
spalding
would
be
at
once
over
it
would
be
too
much
indeed
if
in
this
american
household
he
were
to
find
the
old
vices
of
an
aristocracy
superadded
to
young
republican
sins
nevertheless
lady
banbury
was
as
he
knew
well
a
person
whose
opinion
about
young
people
was
supposed
to
be
very
good
she
noticed
those
only
who
were
worthy
of
notice
and
to
have
been
taken
by
the
hand
by
lady
banbury
was
acknowledged
to
be
a
passport
into
good
society
if
caroline
spalding
was
in
truth
going
to
rome
with
lady
banbury
that
fact
was
in
itself
a
great
confirmation
of
glascock
good
opinion
of
her
spalding
had
perhaps
understood
this
but
had
not
understood
that
having
just
hinted
that
it
was
so
she
should
have
abstained
from
saying
a
word
more
about
her
dear
girl
clever
and
must
indeed
be
the
hand
of
the
fisherwoman
in
matrimonial
waters
who
is
able
to
throw
her
fly
without
showing
any
glimpse
of
the
hook
to
the
fish
for
whom
she
angles
poor
spalding
though
with
kindly
instincts
towards
her
niece
she
did
on
this
occasion
make
some
slight
attempt
at
angling
was
innocent
of
any
concerted
plan
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
natural
to
say
a
good
word
in
praise
of
her
niece
to
the
man
whom
she
believed
to
be
in
love
with
her
niece
caroline
and
glascock
did
not
meet
each
other
again
till
late
in
the
evening
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
take
his
leave
as
they
came
together
each
of
them
involuntarily
looked
round
to
see
whether
miss
petrie
was
near
had
she
been
there
nothing
would
have
been
said
beyond
the
shortest
farewell
greeting
but
miss
petrie
was
afar
off
electrifying
some
italian
by
the
vehemence
of
her
sentiments
and
the
audacious
volubility
of
a
language
in
which
all
arbitrary
restrictions
were
ignored
are
you
going
she
asked
well
i
believe
i
am
since
i
saw
you
last
i
encountered
miss
petrie
again
and
i
rather
depressed
ah
you
do
know
her
if
you
did
you
would
laugh
at
her
laugh
at
her
indeed
i
do
not
do
that
but
when
i
told
that
i
to
be
thrown
into
the
oven
and
burned
because
i
such
a
old
institution
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
mind
that
not
much
when
it
comes
up
in
the
ordinary
course
of
conversation
but
it
palls
upon
one
when
it
is
asserted
for
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
in
an
evening
alas
alas
exclaimed
miss
spalding
with
mock
energy
and
why
alas
because
it
is
so
impossible
to
make
the
oil
and
vinegar
of
the
old
world
and
of
the
new
mix
together
and
suit
each
other
you
think
it
is
impossible
miss
spalding
i
fear
so
we
are
so
terribly
tender
and
you
are
always
pinching
us
on
our
most
tender
spot
and
we
never
meet
you
without
treading
on
your
gouty
toes
i
do
think
my
toes
are
gouty
said
he
i
apologise
to
your
own
individually
glascock
but
i
must
assert
that
nationally
you
are
subject
to
the
gout
that
is
when
i
told
over
and
over
again
that
i
to
be
cut
down
and
thrown
into
the
oven
never
mind
the
oven
now
glascock
if
my
friend
has
been
i
will
beg
pardon
for
her
but
it
does
seem
to
me
indeed
it
does
with
all
the
reverence
and
partiality
i
have
for
everything
european
the
word
european
was
an
offence
to
him
and
he
shewed
that
it
was
so
by
his
countenance
that
the
idiosyncrasies
of
you
and
of
us
are
so
radically
different
that
we
can
not
be
made
to
amalgamate
and
sympathise
with
each
other
thoroughly
he
paused
for
some
seconds
before
he
answered
her
but
it
was
so
evident
by
his
manner
that
he
was
going
to
speak
that
she
could
neither
leave
him
nor
interrupt
him
i
had
thought
that
it
might
have
been
otherwise
he
said
at
last
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
so
changed
as
to
make
her
know
that
he
was
in
earnest
but
she
did
not
change
her
voice
by
a
single
note
i
afraid
it
can
not
be
so
she
said
speaking
after
her
old
fashion
half
in
earnest
half
in
banter
we
may
make
up
our
minds
to
be
very
civil
to
each
other
when
we
meet
the
threats
of
the
oven
may
no
doubt
be
dropped
on
our
side
and
you
may
abstain
from
expressing
in
words
your
sense
of
our
inferiority
i
never
expressed
anything
of
the
kind
he
said
quite
in
anger
i
am
taking
you
simply
as
the
sample
englishman
not
as
glascock
who
helped
me
and
my
sister
over
the
mountains
such
of
us
as
have
to
meet
in
society
may
agree
to
be
very
courteous
but
courtesy
and
cordiality
are
not
only
not
the
same
but
they
are
incompatible
why
so
courtesy
is
an
effort
and
cordiality
is
free
i
must
be
allowed
to
contradict
the
friend
that
i
love
but
i
assent
too
often
falsely
to
what
is
said
to
me
by
a
passing
acquaintance
in
spite
of
what
the
scripture
says
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
privileges
of
a
brother
that
he
may
call
his
brother
a
fool
shall
you
desire
to
call
your
husband
a
fool
my
husband
he
will
i
suppose
be
at
least
as
dear
to
you
as
a
brother
i
never
had
a
brother
your
sister
then
it
is
the
same
i
suppose
if
i
were
to
have
a
husband
i
hope
he
would
be
the
dearest
to
me
of
all
unless
he
were
so
he
certainly
would
not
be
my
husband
but
between
a
man
and
his
wife
there
does
not
spring
up
that
playful
violent
intimacy
admitting
of
all
liberties
which
comes
from
early
nursery
associations
and
then
there
is
the
difference
of
sex
i
should
not
like
my
wife
to
call
me
a
fool
he
said
i
hope
she
may
never
have
occasion
to
do
so
glascock
marry
an
english
wife
in
your
own
class
as
of
course
you
will
and
then
you
will
be
safe
but
i
have
set
my
heart
fast
on
marrying
an
american
wife
he
said
then
i
ca
tell
what
may
befall
you
it
like
enough
if
you
do
that
that
you
may
be
called
by
some
name
you
will
think
hard
to
bear
but
you
think
better
of
it
like
should
pair
with
like
glascock
if
you
were
to
marry
one
of
our
young
women
you
would
lose
in
dignity
as
much
as
she
would
lose
in
comfort
then
they
parted
and
she
went
off
to
say
farewell
to
other
guests
the
manner
in
which
she
had
answered
what
he
had
said
to
her
had
certainly
been
of
a
nature
to
stop
any
further
speech
of
the
same
kind
had
she
been
gentle
with
him
then
he
would
certainly
have
told
her
that
she
was
the
american
woman
whom
he
desired
to
take
with
him
to
his
home
in
england

fate
towards
the
end
of
february
sir
peter
mancrudy
declared
miss
stanbury
to
be
out
of
danger
and
martin
began
to
be
sprightly
on
the
subject
taking
to
himself
no
inconsiderable
share
of
the
praise
accruing
to
the
medical
faculty
in
exeter
generally
for
the
saving
of
a
life
so
valuable
to
the
city
yes
burgess
sir
peter
said
to
old
barty
of
the
bank
our
friend
will
get
over
it
this
time
and
without
any
serious
damage
to
her
constitution
if
she
will
only
take
care
of
herself
barty
made
some
inaudible
grunt
intended
to
indicate
his
own
indifference
on
the
subject
and
expressed
his
opinion
to
the
chief
clerk
that
old
jemima
wideawake
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
her
was
one
of
those
tough
customers
who
would
never
die
it
would
be
nothing
to
us
barty
one
way
or
the
other
said
the
clerk
to
which
barty
burgess
assented
with
another
grunt
camilla
french
declared
that
she
was
delighted
to
hear
the
news
at
this
time
there
had
been
some
sort
of
a
reconciliation
between
her
and
her
lover
french
had
extracted
from
him
a
promise
that
he
would
not
go
to
natal
and
camilla
had
commenced
the
preparations
for
her
wedding
his
visits
to
heavitree
were
as
few
and
far
between
as
he
could
make
them
with
any
regard
to
decency
but
the
of
march
was
coming
on
quickly
and
as
he
was
to
be
made
a
possession
of
them
for
ever
it
was
considered
to
be
safe
and
well
to
allow
him
some
liberty
in
his
present
condition
my
dear
if
they
are
driven
there
is
no
knowing
what
they
wo
do
french
said
to
her
daughter
camilla
had
submitted
with
compressed
lips
and
a
slight
nod
of
her
head
she
had
worked
very
hard
but
her
day
of
reward
was
coming
it
was
impossible
not
to
perceive
both
for
her
and
her
mother
that
the
scantiness
of
gibson
attention
to
his
future
bride
was
cause
of
some
weak
triumph
to
arabella
she
said
that
it
was
very
odd
that
he
did
not
come
and
once
added
with
a
little
sigh
that
he
used
to
come
in
former
days
alluding
to
those
happy
days
in
which
another
love
was
paramount
camilla
could
not
endure
this
with
an
equal
mind
bella
dear
she
said
we
know
what
all
that
means
he
has
made
his
choice
and
if
i
am
satisfied
with
what
he
does
now
surely
you
need
not
grumble
miss
stanbury
illness
had
undoubtedly
been
a
great
source
of
contentment
to
the
family
at
heavitree
as
they
had
all
been
able
to
argue
that
her
impending
demise
was
the
natural
consequence
of
her
great
sin
in
the
matter
of
dorothy
proposed
marriage
when
however
they
heard
from
martin
that
she
would
certainly
recover
that
sir
peter
edict
to
that
effect
had
gone
forth
they
were
willing
to
acknowledge
that
providence
having
so
far
punished
the
sinner
was
right
in
staying
its
hand
and
abstaining
from
the
final
blow
i
sure
we
are
delighted
said
french
for
though
she
has
said
cruel
things
of
us
and
so
untrue
too
yet
of
course
it
is
our
duty
to
forgive
her
and
we
do
forgive
her
dorothy
had
written
three
or
four
notes
to
brooke
since
his
departure
which
contained
simple
bulletins
of
her
aunt
health
she
always
began
her
letters
with
my
dear
burgess
and
ended
them
with
yours
truly
she
never
made
any
allusion
to
declaration
of
love
or
gave
the
slightest
sign
in
her
letters
to
shew
that
she
even
remembered
it
at
last
she
wrote
to
say
that
her
aunt
was
convalescent
and
in
making
this
announcement
she
allowed
herself
some
enthusiasm
of
expression
she
was
so
happy
and
was
so
sure
that
burgess
would
be
equally
so
and
her
aunt
had
asked
after
her
dear
brooke
expressing
her
great
satisfaction
with
him
in
that
he
had
come
down
to
see
her
when
she
had
been
almost
too
ill
to
see
any
one
in
answer
to
this
there
came
to
her
a
real
from
brooke
burgess
it
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
he
had
written
to
her
the
little
bulletins
had
demanded
no
replies
and
had
received
none
perhaps
there
had
been
a
shade
of
disappointment
on
dorothy
side
in
that
she
had
written
thrice
and
had
been
made
rich
with
no
word
in
return
but
although
her
heart
had
palpitated
on
hearing
the
postman
knock
and
had
palpitated
in
vain
she
had
told
herself
that
it
was
all
as
it
should
be
she
wrote
to
him
because
she
possessed
information
which
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
communicate
he
did
not
write
to
her
because
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
tell
then
had
come
the
and
in
the
there
was
an
imperative
demand
for
a
reply
what
was
she
to
do
to
have
recourse
to
priscilla
for
advice
was
her
first
idea
but
she
herself
believed
that
she
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
her
aunt
which
priscilla
would
not
take
into
account
the
existence
of
which
priscilla
would
by
no
means
admit
she
knew
priscilla
mind
in
this
matter
and
was
sure
that
priscilla
advice
whatever
it
might
be
would
be
given
without
any
regard
to
her
aunt
views
and
then
dorothy
was
altogether
ignorant
of
her
aunt
views
her
aunt
had
been
very
anxious
that
she
should
marry
gibson
but
had
clearly
never
admitted
into
her
mind
the
idea
that
she
might
possibly
marry
brooke
burgess
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
herself
would
be
dishonest
both
to
her
aunt
and
to
her
lover
if
she
were
to
bind
this
man
to
herself
without
her
knowledge
he
was
to
be
her
aunt
heir
and
she
was
maintained
by
her
aunt
liberality
thinking
of
all
this
she
at
last
resolved
that
she
would
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
tell
her
aunt
she
felt
that
the
task
would
be
one
almost
beyond
her
strength
thrice
she
went
into
her
aunt
room
intending
to
make
a
clean
breast
thrice
her
courage
failed
her
and
she
left
the
room
with
her
tale
untold
excusing
herself
on
various
pretexts
her
aunt
had
seemed
to
be
not
quite
so
well
or
had
declared
herself
to
be
tired
or
had
been
a
little
cross
or
else
martha
had
come
in
at
the
nick
of
time
but
there
was
brooke
burgess
letter
unanswered
a
letter
that
was
read
night
and
morning
and
which
was
never
for
an
instant
out
of
her
mind
he
had
demanded
a
reply
and
he
had
a
right
at
least
to
that
the
letter
had
been
with
her
for
four
entire
days
before
she
had
ventured
to
speak
to
her
aunt
on
the
subject
on
the
first
of
march
miss
stanbury
came
out
of
her
for
the
first
time
dorothy
on
the
previous
day
had
decided
on
postponing
her
communication
for
this
occasion
but
when
she
found
herself
sitting
in
the
little
close
at
her
elbow
and
perceived
the
signs
of
weakness
which
the
new
move
had
made
conspicuous
and
heard
the
invalid
declare
that
the
little
journey
had
been
almost
too
much
for
her
her
heart
misgave
her
she
ought
to
have
told
her
tale
while
her
aunt
was
still
in
bed
but
presently
there
came
a
question
which
put
her
into
such
a
flutter
that
she
was
for
the
time
devoid
of
all
resolution
has
brooke
written
said
miss
stanbury
yes
aunt
he
has
written
and
what
did
he
say
dorothy
was
struck
quite
dumb
is
there
anything
wrong
and
now
as
miss
stanbury
asked
the
question
she
seemed
herself
to
have
forgotten
that
she
had
two
minutes
before
declared
herself
to
be
almost
too
feeble
to
speak
i
sure
there
is
something
wrong
what
is
it
i
will
know
there
is
nothing
wrong
aunt
stanbury
where
is
the
letter
let
me
see
it
i
mean
there
is
nothing
wrong
about
him
what
is
it
then
he
is
quite
well
aunt
stanbury
shew
me
the
letter
i
will
see
the
letter
i
know
that
there
is
something
the
matter
do
you
mean
to
say
you
wo
shew
me
letter
there
was
a
moment
pause
before
dorothy
answered
i
will
shew
you
his
letter
though
i
am
sure
he
did
mean
that
i
should
shew
it
to
anyone
he
has
written
evil
of
me
no
no
no
he
would
sooner
cut
his
hand
off
than
say
a
word
bad
of
you
he
never
says
or
writes
anything
bad
of
anybody
but
oh
aunt
i
tell
you
everything
i
should
have
told
you
before
only
that
you
were
then
miss
stanbury
was
frightened
what
is
it
she
said
hoarsely
clasping
the
arms
of
the
great
chair
each
with
a
thin
shrivelled
hand
aunt
stanbury
brooke
brooke
wants
me
to
be
his
wife
illustration
brooke
wants
me
to
be
his
wife
what
you
can
not
be
more
surprised
than
i
have
been
aunt
stanbury
and
there
has
been
no
fault
of
mine
i
do
believe
it
said
the
old
woman
now
you
may
read
the
letter
said
dorothy
standing
up
she
was
quite
prepared
to
be
obedient
but
she
felt
that
her
aunt
manner
of
receiving
the
information
was
almost
an
insult
he
must
be
a
fool
said
miss
stanbury
this
was
hard
to
bear
and
the
colour
went
and
came
rapidly
across
dorothy
cheeks
as
she
gave
herself
a
few
moments
to
prepare
an
answer
she
already
perceived
that
her
aunt
would
be
altogether
adverse
to
the
marriage
and
that
therefore
the
marriage
could
never
take
place
she
had
never
for
a
moment
allowed
herself
to
think
otherwise
but
nevertheless
the
blow
was
heavy
on
her
we
all
know
how
constantly
hope
and
expectation
will
rise
high
within
our
own
bosoms
in
opposition
to
our
own
judgment
how
we
become
sanguine
in
regard
to
events
which
we
almost
know
can
never
come
to
pass
so
it
had
been
with
dorothy
her
heart
had
been
almost
in
a
flutter
of
happiness
since
she
had
had
brooke
letter
in
her
possession
and
yet
she
never
ceased
to
declare
to
herself
her
own
conviction
that
that
letter
could
lead
to
no
good
result
in
regard
to
her
own
wishes
on
the
subject
she
had
never
asked
herself
a
single
question
as
it
had
been
quite
beyond
her
power
to
bring
herself
to
endure
the
idea
of
marrying
gibson
so
it
had
been
quite
impossible
to
her
not
to
long
to
be
brooke
wife
from
the
moment
in
which
a
suggestion
to
that
effect
had
fallen
from
his
lips
this
was
a
state
of
things
so
certain
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
though
she
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
him
in
which
she
owned
her
love
she
had
never
for
a
moment
doubted
that
he
knew
the
truth
and
that
everybody
else
concerned
would
know
it
too
but
she
did
not
suppose
that
her
wishes
would
go
for
anything
with
her
aunt
brooke
burgess
was
to
become
a
rich
man
as
her
aunt
heir
and
her
aunt
would
of
course
have
her
own
ideas
about
brooke
advancement
in
life
she
was
quite
prepared
to
submit
without
quarrelling
when
her
aunt
should
tell
her
that
the
idea
must
not
be
entertained
but
the
order
might
be
given
the
prohibition
might
be
pronounced
without
an
insult
to
her
own
feelings
as
a
woman
he
must
be
a
fool
miss
stanbury
had
said
and
dorothy
took
time
to
collect
her
thoughts
before
she
would
reply
in
the
meantime
her
aunt
finished
the
reading
of
the
letter
he
may
be
foolish
in
this
dorothy
said
but
i
do
think
you
should
call
him
a
fool
i
shall
call
him
what
i
please
i
suppose
this
was
going
on
at
the
time
when
you
refused
mr
gibson
nothing
was
going
on
nothing
has
gone
on
at
all
said
dorothy
with
as
much
indignation
as
she
was
able
to
assume
how
can
you
tell
me
that
that
is
an
untruth
it
is
not
an
untruth
said
dorothy
almost
sobbing
but
driven
at
the
same
time
to
much
anger
do
you
mean
to
say
that
this
is
the
first
you
ever
heard
of
it
and
she
held
out
the
letter
shaking
it
in
her
thin
hand
i
have
never
said
so
aunt
stanbury
yes
you
did
i
said
that
nothing
was
going
on
when
gibson
was
if
you
choose
to
suspect
me
aunt
stanbury
i
go
away
i
wo
stay
here
if
you
suspect
me
when
brooke
spoke
to
me
i
told
him
you
like
it
of
course
i
do
like
it
but
she
gave
no
reason
why
she
did
not
like
it
and
there
was
nothing
more
till
this
letter
came
i
could
help
his
writing
to
me
it
was
my
fault
psha
if
you
are
angry
i
am
very
sorry
but
you
have
a
right
to
be
angry
go
on
dorothy
go
on
i
so
weak
that
i
can
hardly
stir
myself
it
the
first
moment
that
i
been
out
of
my
bed
for
weeks
and
of
course
you
can
say
what
you
please
i
know
what
it
will
be
i
shall
have
to
take
to
my
bed
again
and
then
in
a
very
little
time
you
can
both
make
fools
of
yourselves
just
as
you
like
this
was
an
argument
against
which
dorothy
of
course
found
it
to
be
quite
impossible
to
make
continued
combat
she
could
only
shuffle
her
letter
back
into
her
pocket
and
be
if
possible
more
assiduous
than
ever
in
her
attentions
to
the
invalid
she
knew
that
she
had
been
treated
most
unjustly
and
there
would
be
a
question
to
be
answered
as
soon
as
her
aunt
should
be
well
as
to
the
possibility
of
her
remaining
in
the
close
subject
to
such
injustice
but
let
her
aunt
say
what
she
might
or
do
what
she
might
dorothy
could
not
leave
her
for
the
present
miss
stanbury
sat
for
a
considerable
time
quite
motionless
with
her
eyes
closed
and
did
not
stir
or
make
signs
of
life
till
dorothy
touched
her
arm
asking
her
whether
she
would
not
take
some
broth
which
had
been
prepared
for
her
where
martha
why
does
not
martha
come
said
miss
stanbury
this
was
a
hard
blow
and
from
that
moment
dorothy
believed
that
it
would
be
expedient
that
she
should
return
to
nuncombe
putney
the
broth
however
was
taken
while
dorothy
sat
by
in
silence
only
one
word
further
was
said
that
evening
by
miss
stanbury
about
brooke
and
his
love
affair
there
must
be
nothing
more
about
this
dorothy
remember
that
nothing
at
all
i
wo
have
it
dorothy
made
no
reply
brooke
letter
was
in
her
pocket
and
it
should
be
answered
that
night
on
the
following
day
she
would
let
her
aunt
know
what
she
had
said
to
brooke
her
aunt
should
not
see
the
letter
but
should
be
made
acquainted
with
its
purport
in
reference
to
brooke
proposal
of
marriage
i
wo
have
it
that
had
been
her
aunt
command
what
right
had
her
aunt
to
give
any
command
upon
the
matter
then
crossed
mind
as
she
thought
of
this
a
glimmering
of
an
idea
that
no
one
can
be
entitled
to
issue
commands
who
can
not
enforce
obedience
if
brooke
and
she
chose
to
become
man
and
wife
by
mutual
consent
how
could
her
aunt
prohibit
the
marriage
then
there
followed
another
idea
that
commands
are
enforced
by
the
threatening
and
if
necessary
by
the
enforcement
of
penalties
her
aunt
had
within
her
hand
no
penalty
of
which
dorothy
was
afraid
on
her
own
behalf
but
she
had
the
power
of
inflicting
a
terrible
punishment
on
brooke
burgess
now
dorothy
conceived
that
she
herself
would
be
the
meanest
creature
alive
if
she
were
actuated
by
fears
as
to
money
in
her
acceptance
or
rejection
of
a
man
whom
she
loved
as
she
did
brooke
burgess
brooke
had
an
income
of
his
own
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
ample
for
all
purposes
but
that
which
would
have
been
sordid
in
her
did
not
seem
to
her
to
have
any
stain
of
sordidness
for
him
he
was
a
man
and
was
bound
to
be
rich
if
he
could
and
moreover
what
had
she
to
offer
in
herself
such
a
poor
thing
as
was
she
to
make
compensation
to
him
for
the
loss
of
fortune
her
aunt
could
inflict
this
penalty
and
therefore
the
power
was
hers
and
the
power
must
be
obeyed
she
would
write
to
brooke
in
a
manner
that
should
convey
to
him
her
firm
decision
but
not
the
less
on
that
account
would
she
let
her
aunt
know
that
she
thought
herself
to
have
been
it
was
an
insult
to
her
a
most
insult
that
telling
her
that
brooke
had
been
a
fool
for
loving
her
and
then
that
accusation
against
her
of
having
been
false
of
having
given
one
reason
for
refusing
gibson
while
there
was
another
reason
in
her
heart
of
having
been
cunning
and
then
untrue
was
not
to
be
endured
what
would
her
aunt
think
of
her
if
she
were
to
bear
such
allegations
without
indignant
protest
she
would
write
her
letter
and
speak
her
mind
to
her
aunt
as
soon
as
her
aunt
should
be
well
enough
to
hear
it
as
she
had
resolved
she
wrote
her
letter
that
night
before
she
went
to
bed
she
wrote
it
with
floods
of
tears
and
a
bitterness
of
heart
which
almost
conquered
her
she
too
had
heard
of
love
and
had
been
taught
to
feel
that
the
success
or
failure
of
a
woman
life
depended
upon
that
whether
she
did
or
whether
she
did
not
by
such
gifts
as
god
might
have
given
to
her
attract
to
herself
some
man
strong
enough
and
good
enough
and
loving
enough
to
make
straight
for
her
her
paths
to
bear
for
her
her
burdens
to
be
the
father
of
her
children
the
staff
on
which
she
might
lean
and
the
wall
against
which
she
might
grow
feeling
the
sunshine
and
sheltered
from
the
wind
she
had
ever
estimated
her
own
value
so
lowly
as
to
have
told
herself
often
that
such
success
could
never
come
in
her
way
from
her
earliest
years
she
had
regarded
herself
as
outside
the
pale
within
which
such
joys
are
to
be
found
she
had
so
strictly
taught
herself
to
look
forward
to
a
blank
existence
that
she
had
learned
to
do
so
without
active
misery
but
not
the
less
did
she
know
where
happiness
lay
and
when
the
good
thing
came
almost
within
her
reach
when
it
seemed
that
god
had
given
her
gifts
which
might
have
sufficed
when
a
man
had
sought
her
hand
whose
nature
was
such
that
she
could
have
leaned
on
him
with
a
true
worship
could
have
grown
against
him
as
against
a
wall
with
perfect
confidence
could
have
lain
with
her
head
upon
his
bosom
and
have
felt
that
of
all
spots
that
in
the
world
was
the
most
fitting
for
her
when
this
was
all
but
grasped
and
must
yet
be
abandoned
there
came
upon
her
spirit
an
agony
so
bitter
that
she
had
not
before
known
how
great
might
be
the
depth
of
human
disappointment
but
the
letter
was
at
last
written
and
when
finished
was
as
follows
the
close
exeter
march
dear
brooke
there
had
been
many
doubts
about
this
but
at
last
they
were
conquered
and
the
name
was
written
i
have
shown
your
letter
to
my
aunt
as
i
am
sure
you
will
think
was
best
i
should
have
answered
it
before
only
that
i
thought
that
she
was
not
quite
well
enough
to
talk
about
it
she
says
as
i
was
sure
she
would
that
what
you
propose
is
quite
out
of
the
question
i
am
aware
that
i
am
bound
to
obey
her
and
as
i
think
that
you
also
ought
to
do
so
i
shall
think
no
more
of
what
you
have
said
to
me
and
have
written
it
is
quite
impossible
now
even
if
it
might
have
been
possible
under
other
circumstances
i
shall
always
remember
your
great
kindness
to
me
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
that
i
am
very
grateful
for
the
compliment
you
have
paid
me
i
shall
think
of
you
always
till
i
die
believe
me
to
be
your
very
sincere
friend
dorothy
stanbury
the
next
day
miss
stanbury
again
came
out
of
her
room
and
on
the
third
day
she
was
manifestly
becoming
stronger
dorothy
had
as
yet
not
spoken
of
her
letter
but
was
prepared
to
do
so
as
soon
as
she
thought
that
a
fitting
opportunity
had
come
she
had
a
word
or
two
to
say
for
herself
but
she
must
not
again
subject
herself
to
being
told
that
she
was
taking
her
will
of
her
aunt
because
her
aunt
was
too
ill
to
defend
herself
but
on
the
third
day
miss
stanbury
herself
asked
the
question
have
you
written
anything
to
brooke
she
asked
i
have
answered
his
letter
aunt
stanbury
and
what
have
you
said
to
him
i
have
told
him
that
you
disapproved
of
it
and
that
nothing
more
must
be
said
about
it
yes
of
course
you
made
me
out
to
be
an
ogre
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
aunt
i
am
sure
that
i
told
him
the
truth
may
i
see
the
letter
it
has
gone
but
you
have
kept
a
copy
said
miss
stanbury
yes
i
have
got
a
copy
replied
dorothy
but
i
would
rather
not
shew
it
i
told
him
just
what
i
tell
you
dorothy
it
is
not
at
all
becoming
that
you
should
have
a
correspondence
with
any
young
man
of
such
a
nature
that
you
should
be
ashamed
to
shew
it
to
your
aunt
i
am
not
ashamed
of
anything
said
dorothy
sturdily
i
do
know
what
young
women
in
these
days
have
come
to
continued
miss
stanbury
there
is
no
respect
no
subjection
no
obedience
and
too
often
no
modesty
does
that
mean
me
aunt
stanbury
asked
dorothy
to
tell
you
the
truth
dorothy
i
do
think
you
ought
to
have
been
receiving
from
brooke
burgess
when
i
was
lying
ill
in
bed
i
did
expect
it
of
you
i
tell
you
fairly
that
i
expect
it
of
you
then
dorothy
spoke
out
her
mind
as
you
think
that
aunt
stanbury
i
had
better
go
away
and
if
you
please
i
will
when
you
are
well
enough
to
spare
me
pray
do
think
of
me
at
all
said
her
aunt
and
as
for
burgess
has
written
to
me
once
i
do
think
that
there
can
be
anything
immodest
in
opening
a
letter
when
it
comes
by
the
post
and
as
soon
as
i
had
it
i
determined
to
shew
it
to
you
as
for
what
happened
before
when
burgess
spoke
to
me
which
was
long
long
after
all
that
about
gibson
was
over
i
told
him
that
it
could
be
so
and
i
thought
there
would
be
no
more
about
it
you
were
so
ill
that
i
could
not
tell
you
now
you
know
it
all
i
have
not
seen
your
letter
to
him
i
shall
never
shew
it
to
anybody
but
you
have
said
things
aunt
stanbury
that
are
very
cruel
of
course
everything
i
say
is
wrong
you
have
told
me
that
i
was
telling
untruths
and
you
have
called
me
immodest
that
is
a
terrible
word
you
should
deserve
it
then
i
never
have
deserved
it
and
i
wo
bear
it
no
i
wo
if
hugh
heard
me
called
that
word
i
believe
he
tear
the
house
down
hugh
indeed
he
to
be
brought
in
between
us
is
he
he
my
brother
and
of
course
i
obliged
to
think
of
him
and
if
you
please
i
go
home
as
soon
as
you
are
well
enough
to
spare
me
quickly
after
this
there
were
very
many
letters
coming
and
going
between
the
house
in
the
close
and
the
ladies
at
nuncombe
putney
and
hugh
stanbury
and
brooke
burgess
the
correspondent
of
brooke
burgess
was
of
course
miss
stanbury
herself
the
letters
to
hugh
and
to
nuncombe
putney
were
written
by
dorothy
of
the
former
we
need
be
told
nothing
at
the
present
moment
but
the
upshot
of
all
poor
dolly
letters
was
that
on
the
tenth
of
march
she
was
to
return
home
to
nuncombe
putney
share
once
more
her
sister
bed
and
mother
poverty
and
abandon
the
comforts
of
the
close
before
this
became
a
definite
arrangement
miss
stanbury
had
given
way
in
a
certain
small
degree
she
had
acknowledged
that
dorothy
had
intended
no
harm
but
this
was
not
enough
for
dorothy
who
was
conscious
of
no
harm
either
done
or
intended
she
did
not
specify
her
terms
or
require
specifically
that
her
aunt
should
make
apology
for
that
word
immodest
or
at
least
withdraw
it
but
she
resolved
that
she
would
go
unless
it
was
most
absolutely
declared
to
have
been
applied
to
her
without
the
slightest
reason
she
felt
moreover
that
her
house
ought
to
be
open
to
brooke
burgess
and
that
it
could
not
be
open
to
them
both
and
so
she
went
having
resided
under
her
roof
between
nine
and
ten
months
aunt
stanbury
said
dorothy
kissing
her
aunt
with
a
tear
in
her
eye
and
a
sob
in
her
throat
my
dear
and
miss
stanbury
as
she
pressed
her
niece
hand
left
in
it
a
i
much
obliged
aunt
i
am
indeed
but
i
rather
not
and
the
was
left
on
the
parlour
table
chapter
lviii
dorothy
at
home
dorothy
was
received
at
home
with
so
much
affection
and
such
expressions
of
esteem
as
to
afford
her
much
consolation
in
her
misery
both
her
mother
and
her
sister
approved
of
her
conduct
stanbury
approval
was
indeed
accompanied
by
many
expressions
of
regret
as
to
the
good
things
lost
she
was
fully
alive
to
the
fact
that
life
in
the
close
at
exeter
was
better
for
her
daughter
than
life
in
their
little
cottage
at
nuncombe
putney
the
outward
appearance
which
dorothy
bore
on
her
return
home
was
proof
of
this
her
clothes
the
set
of
her
hair
her
very
gestures
and
motions
had
framed
themselves
on
town
ideas
the
faded
wildered
look
the
uncertain
purposeless
bearing
which
had
come
from
her
secluded
life
and
subjection
to
her
sister
had
vanished
from
her
she
had
lived
among
people
and
had
learned
something
of
their
gait
and
carriage
money
we
know
will
do
almost
everything
and
no
doubt
money
had
had
much
to
do
with
this
it
is
very
pretty
to
talk
of
the
alluring
simplicity
of
a
clean
calico
gown
but
poverty
will
shew
itself
to
be
meagre
dowdy
and
draggled
in
a
woman
dress
let
the
woman
be
ever
so
simple
ever
so
neat
ever
so
independent
and
ever
so
stanbury
was
quite
alive
to
all
that
her
younger
daughter
was
losing
had
she
not
received
two
offers
of
marriage
while
she
was
at
exeter
there
was
no
possibility
that
offers
of
marriage
should
be
made
in
the
cottage
at
nuncombe
putney
a
man
within
the
walls
of
the
cottage
would
have
been
considered
as
much
out
of
place
as
a
wild
bull
it
had
been
matter
of
deep
regret
to
stanbury
that
her
daughter
should
not
have
found
herself
able
to
marry
gibson
she
knew
that
there
was
no
matter
for
reproach
in
this
but
it
was
a
misfortune
a
great
misfortune
and
in
the
mother
breast
there
had
been
a
sad
unrepressed
feeling
of
regret
that
young
people
should
so
often
lose
their
chances
in
the
world
through
and
ignorance
as
to
their
own
good
now
when
she
heard
the
story
of
brooke
burgess
she
could
not
but
think
that
had
dorothy
remained
at
exeter
enduring
patiently
such
hard
words
as
her
aunt
might
speak
the
love
affair
might
have
been
brought
at
some
future
time
to
a
happy
conclusion
she
did
not
say
all
this
but
there
came
on
her
a
silent
melancholy
made
expressive
by
constant
little
shakings
of
the
head
and
a
continued
reproachful
sadness
of
demeanour
which
was
quite
as
intelligible
to
priscilla
as
would
have
been
any
spoken
words
but
priscilla
approval
of
her
sister
conduct
was
clear
outspoken
and
satisfactory
she
had
been
quite
sure
that
her
sister
had
been
right
about
gibson
and
was
equally
sure
that
she
was
now
right
about
brooke
burgess
priscilla
had
in
her
mind
an
idea
that
if
b
as
they
called
him
was
half
as
good
as
her
sister
represented
him
to
be
for
indeed
dorothy
endowed
him
with
every
virtue
consistent
with
humanity
he
would
not
be
deterred
from
his
pursuit
either
by
dolly
letter
or
by
aunt
stanbury
commands
but
of
this
she
thought
it
wise
to
say
nothing
she
paid
dolly
the
warm
and
hitherto
unaccustomed
compliment
of
equality
assuming
to
regard
her
sister
judgment
and
persistent
independence
to
be
equally
strong
with
her
own
and
as
she
knew
well
she
could
not
have
gone
further
than
this
i
never
shall
agree
with
you
about
aunt
stanbury
she
said
to
me
she
seems
to
be
so
imperious
so
exacting
and
also
so
unjust
as
to
be
unbearable
but
she
is
affectionate
said
dolly
so
is
the
dog
that
bites
you
and
for
aught
i
know
the
horse
that
kicks
you
but
it
is
ill
living
with
biting
dogs
and
kicking
horses
but
all
that
matters
little
as
you
are
still
your
own
mistress
how
strange
these
nine
months
have
been
with
you
in
exeter
while
we
have
been
at
the
clock
house
and
here
we
are
together
again
in
the
old
way
just
as
though
nothing
had
happened
but
dorothy
knew
well
that
a
great
deal
had
happened
and
that
her
life
could
never
be
as
it
had
been
heretofore
the
very
tone
in
which
her
sister
spoke
to
her
was
proof
of
this
she
had
an
infinitely
greater
possession
in
herself
than
had
belonged
to
her
before
her
residence
at
exeter
but
that
possession
was
so
heavily
mortgaged
and
so
burthened
as
to
make
her
believe
that
the
change
was
to
be
regretted
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
there
came
a
letter
from
aunt
stanbury
to
dorothy
it
began
by
saying
that
dolly
had
left
behind
her
certain
small
properties
which
had
now
been
made
up
in
a
parcel
and
sent
by
the
railway
carriage
paid
but
they
were
mine
at
all
said
dolly
alluding
to
certain
books
in
which
she
had
taken
delight
she
means
to
give
them
to
you
said
priscilla
and
i
think
you
must
take
them
and
the
shawl
is
no
more
mine
than
it
is
yours
though
i
wore
it
two
or
three
times
in
the
winter
priscilla
was
of
opinion
that
the
shawl
must
be
taken
also
then
the
letter
spoke
of
the
writer
health
and
at
last
fell
into
such
a
strain
of
confidential
gossip
that
stanbury
when
she
read
it
could
not
understand
that
there
had
been
a
quarrel
martha
says
that
she
saw
camilla
french
in
the
street
such
a
guy
in
her
new
finery
as
never
was
seen
before
except
on
then
in
the
postscript
dorothy
was
enjoined
to
answer
this
letter
quickly
none
of
your
short
scraps
my
dear
said
aunt
stanbury
she
must
mean
you
to
go
back
to
her
said
stanbury
no
doubt
she
does
said
priscilla
but
dolly
need
not
go
because
my
aunt
means
it
we
are
not
her
creatures
but
dorothy
answered
her
aunt
letter
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
had
been
written
she
asked
after
her
aunt
health
thanked
her
aunt
for
the
gift
of
the
books
in
each
of
which
her
name
had
been
clearly
written
protested
about
the
shawl
sent
her
love
to
martha
and
her
kind
regards
to
jane
and
expressed
a
hope
that
enjoyed
her
new
clothes
she
described
the
cottage
and
was
funny
about
the
cabbage
stumps
in
the
garden
and
at
last
succeeded
in
concocting
a
long
epistle
i
suppose
there
will
be
a
regular
correspondence
said
priscilla
two
days
afterwards
however
the
correspondence
took
altogether
another
form
the
cottage
in
which
they
now
lived
was
supposed
to
be
beyond
the
beat
of
the
postman
and
therefore
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
call
at
the
for
their
letters
on
the
morning
in
question
priscilla
obtained
a
thick
letter
from
exeter
for
her
mother
and
knew
that
it
had
come
from
her
aunt
her
aunt
could
hardly
have
found
it
necessary
to
correspond
with
dorothy
mother
so
soon
after
that
letter
to
dorothy
had
been
written
had
there
not
arisen
some
very
peculiar
cause
priscilla
after
much
meditation
thought
it
better
that
the
letter
should
be
opened
in
dorothy
absence
and
in
dorothy
absence
the
following
letter
was
read
both
by
priscilla
and
her
mother
the
close
march
dear
sister
stanbury
after
much
consideration
i
think
it
best
to
send
under
cover
to
you
the
enclosed
letter
from
brooke
burgess
intended
for
your
daughter
dorothy
you
will
see
that
i
have
opened
it
and
read
it
as
i
was
clearly
entitled
to
do
the
letter
having
been
addressed
to
my
niece
while
she
was
supposed
to
be
under
my
care
i
do
not
like
to
destroy
the
letter
though
perhaps
that
would
be
best
but
i
would
advise
you
to
do
so
if
it
be
possible
without
shewing
it
to
dorothy
i
have
told
brooke
burgess
what
i
have
done
i
have
also
told
him
that
i
can
not
sanction
a
marriage
between
him
and
your
daughter
there
are
many
reasons
of
old
date
not
to
speak
of
present
reasons
also
which
would
make
such
a
marriage
highly
inexpedient
brooke
burgess
is
of
course
his
own
master
but
your
daughter
understands
completely
how
the
matter
stands
yours
truly
jemima
stanbury
what
a
wicked
old
woman
said
priscilla
then
there
arose
a
question
whether
they
should
read
brooke
letter
or
whether
they
should
give
it
unread
to
dorothy
priscilla
denounced
her
aunt
in
the
strongest
language
she
could
use
for
having
broken
the
seal
entitled
because
dorothy
had
been
living
with
her
exclaimed
priscilla
she
can
have
no
proper
conception
of
honour
or
of
honesty
she
had
no
more
right
to
open
dorothy
letter
than
she
had
to
take
her
money
stanbury
was
very
anxious
to
read
brooke
letter
alleging
that
they
would
then
be
able
to
judge
whether
it
should
be
handed
over
to
dorothy
but
priscilla
sense
of
right
would
not
admit
of
this
dorothy
must
receive
the
letter
from
her
lover
with
no
further
stain
from
unauthorised
eyes
than
that
to
which
it
had
been
already
subjected
she
was
called
in
therefore
from
the
kitchen
and
the
whole
packet
was
given
to
her
your
aunt
has
read
the
enclosure
dolly
but
we
have
not
opened
it
dorothy
took
the
packet
without
a
word
and
sat
herself
down
she
first
read
her
aunt
letter
very
slowly
i
understand
perfectly
she
said
folding
it
up
almost
listlessly
while
brooke
letter
lay
still
unopened
on
her
lap
then
she
took
it
up
and
held
it
awhile
in
both
hands
while
her
mother
and
priscilla
watched
her
priscilla
she
said
do
you
read
it
first
priscilla
was
immediately
at
her
side
kissing
her
no
my
darling
no
she
said
it
is
for
you
to
read
it
then
dorothy
took
the
precious
contents
from
the
envelope
and
opened
the
folds
of
the
paper
when
she
had
read
a
dozen
words
her
eyes
were
so
suffused
with
tears
that
she
could
hardly
make
herself
mistress
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
but
she
knew
that
it
contained
renewed
assurances
of
her
lover
love
and
assurance
on
his
part
that
he
would
take
no
refusal
from
her
based
on
any
other
ground
than
that
of
her
own
indifference
to
him
he
had
written
to
miss
stanbury
to
the
same
effect
but
he
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
explain
this
to
dorothy
nor
did
miss
stanbury
in
her
letter
tell
them
that
she
had
received
any
communication
from
him
shall
i
read
it
now
said
priscilla
as
soon
as
dorothy
again
allowed
the
letter
to
fall
into
her
lap
both
priscilla
and
stanbury
read
it
and
for
awhile
they
sat
with
the
two
letters
among
them
without
much
speech
about
them
stanbury
was
endeavouring
to
make
herself
believe
that
her
opposition
might
be
overcome
and
that
then
dorothy
might
be
married
priscilla
was
inquiring
of
herself
whether
it
would
be
well
that
dorothy
should
defy
her
aunt
so
much
at
any
rate
would
be
well
and
marry
the
man
even
to
his
deprivation
of
the
old
woman
fortune
priscilla
had
her
doubts
about
this
being
very
strong
in
her
ideas
of
that
her
sister
should
put
up
with
the
bitterest
disappointment
rather
than
injure
the
man
she
loved
was
right
but
then
it
would
also
be
so
extremely
right
to
defy
aunt
stanbury
to
her
teeth
but
dorothy
in
whose
character
was
mixed
with
her
mother
softness
much
of
the
old
stanbury
strength
had
no
doubt
in
her
mind
it
was
very
sweet
to
be
so
loved
what
gratitude
did
she
not
owe
to
a
man
who
was
so
true
to
her
what
was
she
that
she
should
stand
in
his
way
to
lay
herself
down
that
she
might
be
crushed
in
his
path
was
no
more
than
she
owed
to
him
stanbury
was
the
first
to
speak
i
suppose
he
is
a
very
good
young
man
she
said
i
am
sure
he
is
a
noble
man
said
priscilla
and
why
should
he
marry
whom
he
pleases
as
long
as
she
is
respectable
said
stanbury
in
some
people
eyes
poverty
is
more
disreputable
than
vice
said
priscilla
your
aunt
has
been
so
fond
of
dorothy
pleaded
stanbury
just
as
she
is
of
her
servants
said
priscilla
but
dorothy
said
nothing
her
heart
was
too
full
to
enable
her
to
defend
her
aunt
nor
at
the
present
moment
was
she
strong
enough
to
make
her
mother
understand
that
no
hope
was
to
be
entertained
in
the
course
of
the
day
she
walked
out
with
her
sister
on
the
road
towards
ridleigh
and
there
standing
among
the
rocks
and
ferns
looking
down
upon
the
river
with
the
buzz
of
the
little
mill
within
her
ears
she
explained
the
feelings
of
her
heart
and
her
many
thoughts
with
a
flow
of
words
stronger
as
priscilla
thought
than
she
had
ever
used
before
it
is
not
what
he
would
suffer
now
pris
or
what
he
would
feel
but
what
he
would
feel
ten
twenty
years
hence
when
he
would
know
that
his
children
would
have
been
all
provided
for
had
he
not
lost
his
fortune
by
marrying
me
he
must
be
the
only
judge
whether
he
prefers
you
to
the
old
money
said
priscilla
no
dear
not
the
only
judge
and
it
is
that
pris
not
which
he
likes
best
now
but
which
it
is
best
for
him
that
he
should
have
what
could
i
do
for
him
you
can
love
him
yes
i
can
do
that
and
dorothy
paused
a
moment
to
think
how
exceedingly
well
she
could
do
that
one
thing
but
what
is
that
as
you
said
the
other
day
a
dog
can
do
that
i
am
not
clever
i
play
or
talk
french
or
do
things
that
men
like
their
wives
to
do
and
i
have
lived
here
all
my
life
and
what
am
i
that
for
me
he
should
lose
a
great
fortune
that
is
his
look
out
no
dearest
it
is
mine
and
i
will
look
out
i
shall
be
able
at
any
rate
to
remember
always
that
i
have
loved
him
and
have
not
injured
him
he
may
be
angry
with
me
now
and
there
was
a
feeling
of
pride
at
her
heart
as
she
thought
that
he
would
be
angry
with
her
because
she
did
not
go
to
him
but
he
will
know
at
last
that
i
have
been
as
good
to
him
as
i
knew
how
to
be
then
priscilla
wound
her
arms
round
dorothy
and
kissed
her
my
sister
she
said
my
own
sister
they
walked
on
further
discussing
the
matter
in
all
its
bearings
talking
of
the
act
of
which
dorothy
was
called
on
to
perform
as
though
it
were
some
abstract
thing
the
performance
of
which
was
or
perhaps
was
not
imperatively
demanded
by
the
laws
which
should
govern
humanity
but
with
no
idea
on
the
mind
of
either
of
them
that
there
was
any
longer
a
doubt
as
to
this
special
matter
in
hand
they
were
away
from
home
over
three
hours
and
when
they
returned
dorothy
at
once
wrote
her
two
letters
they
were
very
simple
and
very
short
she
told
brooke
whom
she
now
addressed
as
dear
burgess
that
it
could
not
be
as
he
would
have
it
and
she
told
her
aunt
with
some
terse
independence
of
expression
which
miss
stanbury
quite
understood
that
she
had
considered
the
matter
and
had
thought
it
right
to
refuse
burgess
offer
do
you
think
she
is
very
much
changed
said
stanbury
to
her
eldest
daughter
not
changed
in
the
least
mother
but
the
sun
has
opened
the
bud
and
now
we
see
the
fruit
chapter
lix
bozzle
at
home
illustration
it
had
now
come
to
pass
that
trevelyan
had
not
a
friend
in
the
world
to
whom
he
could
apply
in
the
matter
of
his
wife
and
family
in
the
last
communication
which
he
had
received
from
lady
milborough
she
had
scolded
him
in
terms
that
were
for
her
severe
because
he
had
not
returned
to
his
wife
and
taken
her
off
with
him
to
naples
bideawhile
had
found
himself
obliged
to
decline
to
move
in
the
matter
at
all
with
hugh
stanbury
trevelyan
had
had
a
direct
quarrel
and
outhouse
he
regarded
as
bitter
enemies
who
had
taken
the
part
of
his
wife
without
any
regard
to
the
decencies
of
life
and
now
it
had
come
to
pass
that
his
sole
remaining
ally
samuel
bozzle
the
was
becoming
weary
of
his
service
trevelyan
remained
in
the
north
of
italy
up
to
the
middle
of
march
spending
a
fortune
in
sending
telegrams
to
bozzle
instigating
bozzle
by
all
the
means
in
his
power
to
obtain
possession
of
the
child
desiring
him
at
one
time
to
pounce
down
upon
the
parsonage
of
diddulph
with
a
battalion
of
policemen
armed
to
the
teeth
with
the
law
authority
and
at
another
time
suggesting
to
him
to
find
his
way
by
stratagem
into
outhouse
castle
and
carry
off
the
child
in
his
arms
at
last
he
sent
word
to
say
that
he
himself
would
be
in
england
before
the
end
of
march
and
would
see
that
the
majesty
of
the
law
should
be
vindicated
in
his
favour
bozzle
had
in
truth
made
but
one
personal
application
for
the
child
at
diddulph
in
making
this
he
had
expected
no
success
though
from
the
energetic
nature
of
his
disposition
he
had
made
the
attempt
with
some
zeal
but
he
had
never
applied
again
at
the
parsonage
disregarding
the
letters
the
telegrams
and
even
the
promises
which
had
come
to
him
from
his
employer
with
such
frequency
the
truth
was
that
bozzle
was
opposed
to
the
proposed
separation
of
the
mother
and
the
child
and
that
bozzle
was
a
man
who
listened
to
the
words
of
his
wife
bozzle
was
quite
prepared
to
admit
that
madame
as
trevelyan
had
come
to
be
called
at
no
stony
walk
was
no
better
than
she
should
be
bozzle
was
disposed
to
think
that
ladies
of
quality
among
whom
madame
was
entitled
in
her
estimation
to
take
rank
were
seldom
better
than
they
ought
to
be
and
she
was
quite
willing
that
her
husband
should
earn
his
bread
by
watching
the
lady
or
the
lady
lover
she
had
participated
in
bozzle
triumph
when
he
had
discovered
that
the
colonel
had
gone
to
devonshire
and
again
when
he
had
learned
that
the
lothario
had
been
at
diddulph
and
had
the
case
been
brought
before
the
judge
ordinary
by
means
of
her
husband
exertions
she
would
have
taken
pleasure
in
reading
every
word
of
the
evidence
even
though
her
husband
should
have
been
ever
so
roughly
handled
by
the
lawyers
but
now
when
a
demand
was
made
upon
bozzle
to
violate
the
sanctity
of
the
clergyman
house
and
withdraw
the
child
by
force
or
stratagem
she
began
to
perceive
that
the
palmy
days
of
the
trevelyan
affair
were
over
for
them
and
that
it
would
be
wise
on
her
husband
part
gradually
to
back
out
of
the
gentleman
employment
just
put
it
on
the
bozzle
she
said
one
morning
as
her
husband
stood
before
her
reading
for
the
second
time
a
somewhat
lengthy
epistle
which
had
reached
him
from
italy
while
he
held
the
baby
over
his
shoulder
with
his
left
arm
he
had
just
washed
himself
at
the
sink
and
though
his
face
was
clean
his
hair
was
rough
and
his
shirt
sleeves
were
tucked
up
illustration
put
it
on
the
bozzle
that
all
very
well
maryanne
but
when
a
party
has
took
a
money
a
party
is
bound
to
go
through
with
the
job
gammon
bozzle
it
all
very
well
to
say
gammon
but
his
money
has
been
took
and
there
more
to
come
and
ai
you
worked
for
the
money
down
to
hexeter
one
time
across
the
water
pretty
well
day
and
night
watching
that
ere
clergyman
like
a
cat
what
more
he
have
as
to
the
child
i
wo
hear
of
it
b
the
child
sha
come
here
we
all
be
shewed
up
in
the
papers
as
that
black
that
they
hoot
us
along
the
streets
it
ai
the
regular
line
of
business
bozzle
and
there
ai
no
good
to
be
got
never
by
going
off
the
regular
line
whereupon
bozzle
scratched
his
head
and
again
read
the
letter
a
distinct
promise
of
a
hundred
pounds
was
made
to
him
if
he
would
have
the
child
ready
to
hand
over
to
trevelyan
on
trevelyan
arrival
in
england
it
ai
to
be
done
you
know
said
bozzle
of
course
it
ai
said
bozzle
it
ai
to
be
done
anyways
not
in
my
way
of
business
why
he
go
to
skint
as
i
told
him
when
his
own
lawyer
was
too
dainty
for
the
job
the
paternal
parent
has
a
right
to
his
infants
no
doubt
that
was
bozzle
law
i
do
believe
it
b
but
he
have
i
tell
you
he
ca
suckle
can
he
i
do
believe
a
bit
of
his
rights
when
a
married
woman
has
followers
and
the
husband
do
go
the
wrong
side
of
the
post
too
or
it
ai
proved
again
him
that
he
do
they
never
let
her
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
children
it
been
before
the
court
a
hundred
times
he
get
the
child
fast
enough
if
he
go
before
the
court
anyways
it
ai
your
business
bozzle
and
do
you
meddle
nor
make
the
money
good
money
as
long
as
it
honest
earned
but
when
you
come
to
rampaging
and
breaking
into
a
gent
house
then
i
say
money
may
be
had
a
deal
too
hard
in
this
special
letter
which
had
now
come
to
hand
bozzle
was
not
instructed
to
rampage
he
was
simply
desired
to
make
a
further
official
requisition
for
the
boy
at
the
parsonage
and
to
explain
to
outhouse
outhouse
and
trevelyan
or
to
as
many
of
them
as
he
could
contrive
to
see
that
trevelyan
was
immediately
about
to
return
to
london
and
that
he
would
put
the
law
into
execution
if
his
son
were
not
given
up
to
him
at
once
i
tell
you
what
it
is
exclaimed
bozzle
it
my
belief
as
he
ai
quite
right
up
here
and
bozzle
touched
her
forehead
it
love
for
her
as
has
done
it
then
said
bozzle
shaking
his
head
i
not
a
taking
of
her
part
b
a
woman
as
has
a
husband
as
finds
her
with
her
wittels
regular
and
with
what
decent
and
comfortable
beside
ought
to
be
contented
i
never
said
no
other
than
that
i
ai
no
patience
with
your
saucy
madames
as
ca
remember
as
they
eating
an
honest
man
bread
drat
all
what
is
it
they
wants
they
do
know
what
they
wants
it
just
hidleness
cause
there
ai
a
for
to
do
it
that
as
makes
i
wo
say
what
but
as
for
this
here
child
at
that
moment
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
bozzle
going
into
the
passage
opened
it
herself
and
saw
a
strange
gentleman
bozzle
who
had
stood
at
the
inner
door
saw
that
the
gentleman
was
trevelyan
the
letter
which
was
still
in
the
hand
had
reached
stony
walk
on
the
previous
day
but
the
master
of
the
house
had
been
absent
finding
out
facts
following
up
his
profession
and
earning
an
honest
penny
trevelyan
had
followed
his
letter
quicker
than
he
had
intended
when
it
was
written
and
was
now
with
his
prime
minister
before
his
prime
minister
had
been
able
to
take
any
action
on
the
last
instruction
received
does
one
samuel
bozzle
live
here
asked
trevelyan
then
bozzle
came
forward
and
introduced
his
wife
there
was
no
one
else
present
except
the
baby
and
bozzle
intimated
that
let
matters
be
as
delicate
as
they
might
they
could
be
discussed
with
perfect
security
in
his
wife
presence
but
trevelyan
was
of
a
different
opinion
and
he
was
disgusted
and
revolted
most
unreasonably
by
the
appearance
of
his
domestic
arrangements
bozzle
had
always
waited
upon
him
with
a
decent
coat
and
a
hat
and
clean
shoes
it
is
very
much
easier
for
such
men
as
bozzle
to
carry
decency
of
appearance
about
with
them
than
to
keep
it
at
home
trevelyan
had
never
believed
his
ally
to
be
more
than
an
ordinary
but
he
had
not
considered
how
unattractive
might
be
the
interior
of
a
private
detective
private
residence
bozzle
had
set
a
chair
for
him
but
he
had
declined
to
sit
down
the
room
was
dirty
and
very
close
as
though
no
breath
of
air
was
ever
allowed
to
find
entrance
there
perhaps
you
could
put
on
your
coat
and
walk
out
with
me
for
a
few
minutes
said
trevelyan
bozzle
who
well
understood
that
business
was
business
and
that
wives
were
not
business
felt
no
anger
at
this
and
handed
her
husband
his
best
coat
the
hat
was
fetched
from
a
cupboard
and
it
was
astonishing
to
see
how
easily
and
how
quickly
the
outer
respectability
of
bozzle
was
restored
well
said
trevelyan
as
soon
as
they
were
together
in
the
middle
of
stony
walk
there
has
been
nothing
to
be
done
sir
said
bozzle
why
not
trevelyan
could
perceive
at
once
that
the
authority
which
he
had
once
respected
had
gone
from
the
man
bozzle
away
from
his
own
home
out
on
business
with
his
coat
buttoned
over
his
breast
and
his
best
hat
in
his
hand
was
aware
that
he
commanded
respect
and
he
could
carry
himself
accordingly
he
knew
himself
to
be
somebody
and
could
be
easy
confidential
severe
authoritative
or
even
arrogant
as
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
might
demand
but
he
had
been
found
with
his
coat
off
and
a
baby
in
his
arms
and
he
could
not
recover
himself
i
do
not
suppose
that
anybody
will
question
my
right
to
have
the
care
of
my
own
child
said
trevelyan
if
you
would
have
gone
to
skint
sir
suggested
bozzle
there
ai
no
smarter
gent
in
all
the
profession
sir
than
mr
skint
trevelyan
made
no
reply
to
this
but
walked
on
in
silence
with
his
minister
at
his
elbow
he
was
very
wretched
understanding
well
the
degradation
to
which
he
was
subjecting
himself
in
discussing
his
wife
conduct
with
this
man
but
with
whom
else
could
he
discuss
it
the
man
seemed
to
be
meaner
now
than
he
had
been
before
he
had
been
seen
in
his
own
home
and
trevelyan
was
conscious
too
that
he
himself
was
not
in
outward
appearance
as
he
used
to
be
that
he
was
and
haggard
and
worn
and
visibly
a
wretched
being
how
can
any
man
care
to
dress
himself
with
attention
who
is
always
alone
and
always
miserable
when
alone
during
the
months
which
had
passed
over
him
since
he
had
sent
his
wife
away
from
him
his
very
nature
had
been
altered
and
he
himself
was
aware
of
the
change
as
he
went
about
his
eyes
were
ever
cast
downwards
and
he
walked
with
a
quick
shuffling
gait
and
he
suspected
others
feeling
that
he
himself
was
suspected
and
all
work
had
ceased
with
him
since
she
had
left
him
he
had
not
read
a
single
book
that
was
worth
the
reading
and
he
knew
it
all
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
becoming
disgraced
and
degraded
he
would
sooner
have
shot
himself
than
have
walked
into
his
club
or
even
have
allowed
himself
to
be
seen
by
daylight
in
pall
mall
or
piccadilly
he
had
taken
in
his
misery
to
drinking
little
drops
of
brandy
in
the
morning
although
he
knew
well
that
there
was
no
shorter
road
to
the
devil
than
that
opened
by
such
a
habit
he
looked
up
for
a
moment
at
bozzle
and
then
asked
him
a
question
where
is
he
now
you
mean
the
colonel
sir
he
up
in
town
sir
a
minding
of
his
parliamentary
duties
he
have
been
up
all
this
month
sir
they
have
met
bozzle
paused
a
moment
before
he
replied
and
then
smiled
as
he
spoke
it
is
so
hard
to
say
sir
ladies
is
so
cute
and
cunning
i
watched
as
sharp
as
watching
can
go
pretty
near
i
put
a
youngster
on
at
each
hend
and
both
of
hear
a
mouse
stirring
in
his
sleep
i
ai
got
no
evidence
trevelyan
but
if
you
ask
me
my
opinion
why
in
course
they
been
together
somewhere
it
stands
to
reason
trevelyan
do
it
and
bozzle
as
he
said
this
smiled
almost
aloud
d
n
and
b
t
it
all
for
ever
said
trevelyan
gnashing
his
teeth
and
moving
away
into
union
street
as
fast
as
he
could
walk
and
he
did
go
away
leaving
bozzle
standing
in
the
middle
of
stony
walk
he
disturbed
in
his
mind
quite
bozzle
said
when
he
got
back
to
his
wife
he
cursed
and
swore
as
made
even
me
feel
bad
said
his
wife
do
you
listen
to
me
get
in
what
a
howing
and
do
you
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
chapter
lx
another
struggle
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
were
to
reach
england
about
the
end
of
march
or
the
beginning
of
april
and
both
trevelyan
and
nora
rowley
were
almost
sick
for
their
arrival
both
their
uncle
and
aunt
had
done
very
much
for
them
had
been
true
to
them
in
their
need
and
had
submitted
to
endless
discomforts
in
order
that
their
nieces
might
have
respectable
shelter
in
their
great
need
but
nevertheless
their
conduct
had
not
been
of
a
kind
to
produce
either
love
or
friendship
each
of
the
sisters
felt
that
she
had
been
much
better
off
at
nuncombe
putney
and
that
either
the
weakness
of
stanbury
or
the
hardness
of
priscilla
was
preferable
to
the
repulsive
forbearance
of
their
clerical
host
he
did
not
scold
them
he
never
threw
it
in
trevelyan
teeth
that
she
had
been
separated
from
her
husband
by
her
own
fault
he
did
not
tell
them
of
his
own
discomfort
but
he
showed
it
in
every
gesture
and
spoke
of
it
in
every
tone
of
his
voice
so
that
trevelyan
could
not
refrain
from
apologising
for
the
misfortune
of
her
presence
my
dear
he
said
things
ca
be
pleasant
and
unpleasant
at
the
same
time
you
were
quite
right
to
come
here
i
am
glad
for
all
our
sakes
that
sir
marmaduke
will
be
with
us
so
soon
she
had
almost
given
up
in
her
mind
the
hope
that
she
had
long
cherished
that
she
might
some
day
be
able
to
live
again
with
her
husband
every
step
which
he
now
took
in
reference
to
her
seemed
to
be
prompted
by
so
bitter
an
hostility
that
she
could
not
but
believe
that
she
was
hateful
to
him
how
was
it
possible
that
a
husband
and
his
wife
should
again
come
together
when
there
had
been
between
them
such
an
emissary
as
a
detective
policeman
trevelyan
had
gradually
come
to
learn
that
bozzle
had
been
at
nuncombe
putney
watching
her
and
to
be
aware
that
she
was
still
under
the
surveillance
of
his
eye
for
some
months
past
now
she
had
neither
seen
colonel
osborne
nor
heard
from
him
he
had
certainly
by
his
folly
done
much
to
produce
the
ruin
which
had
fallen
upon
her
but
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
blame
him
indeed
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
liable
to
blame
outhouse
always
spoke
of
him
with
indignant
scorn
and
nora
had
learned
to
think
that
much
of
their
misery
was
due
to
his
imprudence
but
trevelyan
would
not
see
this
and
not
seeing
it
was
more
widely
separated
from
her
husband
than
she
would
have
been
had
she
acknowledged
that
any
excuse
for
his
misconduct
had
been
afforded
by
the
vanity
and
folly
of
the
other
man
lady
rowley
had
written
to
have
a
furnished
house
taken
for
them
from
the
first
of
april
and
a
house
had
been
secured
in
manchester
street
the
situation
in
question
is
not
one
which
is
of
itself
very
charming
nor
is
it
supposed
to
be
in
a
high
degree
fashionable
but
nora
looked
forward
to
her
escape
from
diddulph
to
manchester
street
as
though
paradise
were
to
be
to
her
as
soon
as
she
should
be
there
with
her
father
and
mother
she
was
quite
clear
now
as
to
her
course
about
hugh
stanbury
she
did
not
doubt
but
that
she
could
so
argue
the
matter
as
to
get
the
consent
of
her
father
and
mother
she
felt
herself
to
be
altogether
altered
in
her
views
of
life
since
experience
had
come
upon
her
first
at
nuncombe
putney
and
after
that
much
more
heavily
and
seriously
at
diddulph
she
looked
back
as
though
to
a
childish
dream
to
the
ideas
which
had
prevailed
with
her
when
she
had
told
herself
as
she
used
to
do
so
frequently
that
she
was
unfit
to
be
a
poor
man
wife
why
should
she
be
more
unfit
for
such
a
position
than
another
of
course
there
were
many
thoughts
in
her
mind
much
of
memory
if
nothing
of
regret
in
regard
to
glascock
and
the
splendour
that
had
been
offered
to
her
she
had
had
her
chance
of
being
a
rich
man
wife
and
had
rejected
it
had
rejected
it
twice
with
her
eyes
open
readers
will
say
that
if
she
loved
hugh
stanbury
with
all
her
heart
there
could
be
nothing
of
regret
in
her
reflections
but
we
are
perhaps
accustomed
in
judging
for
ourselves
and
of
others
to
draw
the
lines
too
sharply
and
to
say
that
on
this
side
lie
vice
folly
heartlessness
and
greed
and
on
the
other
honour
love
truth
and
wisdom
the
good
and
the
bad
each
in
its
own
domain
but
the
good
and
the
bad
mix
themselves
so
thoroughly
in
our
thoughts
even
in
our
aspirations
that
we
must
look
for
excellence
rather
in
overcoming
evil
than
in
freeing
ourselves
from
its
influence
there
had
been
many
moments
of
regret
with
nora
but
none
of
remorse
at
the
very
moment
in
which
she
had
sent
glascock
away
from
her
and
had
felt
that
he
had
now
been
sent
away
for
always
she
had
been
full
of
regret
since
that
there
had
been
many
hours
in
which
she
had
thought
of
her
own
of
that
teaching
by
which
she
had
striven
to
convince
herself
that
she
could
never
fitly
become
a
poor
man
wife
but
the
upshot
of
it
all
was
a
healthy
pride
in
what
she
had
done
and
a
strong
resolution
that
she
would
make
shirts
and
hem
towels
for
her
husband
if
he
required
it
it
had
been
given
her
to
choose
and
she
had
chosen
she
had
found
herself
unable
to
tell
a
man
that
she
loved
him
when
she
did
not
love
him
and
equally
unable
to
conceal
the
love
which
she
did
feel
if
he
wheeled
a
barrow
of
turnips
about
the
street
i
marry
him
she
said
to
her
sister
one
afternoon
as
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
room
which
ought
to
have
been
their
uncle
study
if
he
wheeled
a
big
barrow
you
have
to
wheel
a
little
one
said
her
sister
then
i
do
it
i
should
mind
there
has
been
this
advantage
in
diddulph
that
nothing
can
be
triste
nothing
dull
nothing
ugly
after
it
it
may
be
so
with
you
nora
that
is
in
imagination
what
i
mean
is
that
living
here
has
taught
me
much
that
i
never
could
have
learned
in
curzon
street
i
used
to
think
myself
such
a
fine
young
woman
but
upon
my
word
i
think
myself
a
finer
one
now
i
do
quite
know
what
you
mean
i
do
quite
know
myself
but
i
nearly
know
i
do
know
this
that
i
made
up
my
own
mind
about
what
i
mean
to
do
you
change
it
dear
when
mamma
is
here
and
things
are
comfortable
again
it
my
belief
that
glascock
would
come
to
you
again
if
you
would
let
him
trevelyan
was
naturally
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
experience
of
transatlantic
excellence
which
glascock
had
encountered
in
italy
but
i
certainly
should
not
let
him
how
would
it
be
possible
after
what
i
wrote
to
hugh
all
that
might
pass
away
said
trevelyan
slowly
after
a
long
pause
all
what
might
pass
away
have
i
not
given
him
a
distinct
promise
have
i
not
told
him
that
i
loved
him
and
sworn
that
i
would
be
true
to
him
can
that
be
made
to
pass
away
even
if
one
wished
it
of
course
it
can
nothing
need
be
fixed
for
you
till
you
have
stood
at
the
altar
with
a
man
and
been
made
his
wife
you
may
choose
still
i
can
never
choose
again
i
never
will
at
any
rate
said
nora
then
there
was
another
pause
it
seems
strange
to
me
nora
said
the
elder
sister
that
after
what
you
have
seen
you
should
be
so
keen
to
be
married
to
any
one
what
is
a
girl
to
do
better
drown
herself
than
do
as
i
have
done
only
think
what
there
is
before
me
what
i
have
gone
through
is
nothing
to
it
of
course
i
must
go
back
to
the
islands
where
else
am
i
to
live
who
else
will
take
me
come
to
us
said
nora
us
nora
who
are
the
us
but
in
no
way
would
that
be
possible
papa
will
be
here
perhaps
for
six
months
nora
thought
it
quite
possible
that
she
might
have
a
home
of
her
own
before
six
months
were
passed
even
though
she
might
be
wheeling
the
smaller
barrow
but
she
would
not
say
so
and
by
that
time
everything
must
be
decided
i
suppose
it
must
of
course
papa
and
mamma
must
go
back
said
trevelyan
papa
might
take
a
pension
he
entitled
to
a
pension
now
he
never
do
that
as
long
as
he
can
have
employment
they
go
back
and
i
must
go
with
them
who
else
would
take
me
in
i
know
who
would
take
you
in
emily
my
darling
that
is
romance
as
for
myself
i
should
not
care
where
i
went
if
it
were
even
to
remain
here
i
could
bear
it
i
could
not
said
nora
decisively
it
is
so
different
with
you
dear
i
do
suppose
it
is
possible
i
should
take
my
boy
with
me
to
the
islands
and
how
am
i
to
go
anywhere
without
him
then
she
broke
down
and
fell
into
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
and
was
in
very
truth
a
woman
nora
was
silent
for
some
minutes
but
at
last
she
spoke
why
do
you
not
go
back
to
him
emily
how
am
i
to
go
back
to
him
what
am
i
to
do
to
make
him
take
me
back
at
this
very
moment
trevelyan
was
in
the
house
but
they
did
not
know
it
write
to
him
said
nora
what
am
i
to
say
in
very
truth
i
do
believe
that
he
is
mad
if
i
write
to
him
should
i
defend
myself
or
accuse
myself
a
dozen
times
i
have
striven
to
write
such
a
letter
not
that
i
might
send
it
but
that
i
might
find
what
i
could
say
should
i
ever
wish
to
send
it
and
it
is
impossible
i
can
only
tell
him
how
unjust
he
has
been
how
cruel
how
mad
how
wicked
could
you
not
say
to
him
simply
this
us
be
together
wherever
it
may
be
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
while
he
is
watching
me
with
a
policeman
while
he
is
still
thinking
that
i
entertain
a
lover
while
he
believes
that
i
am
the
base
thing
that
he
has
dared
to
think
me
he
has
never
believed
it
then
how
can
he
be
such
a
villain
as
to
treat
me
like
this
i
could
not
go
to
him
nora
not
unless
i
went
to
him
as
one
who
was
known
to
be
mad
over
whom
in
his
wretched
condition
it
would
be
my
duty
to
keep
watch
in
no
other
way
could
i
overcome
my
abhorrence
of
the
outrages
to
which
he
has
subjected
me
but
for
the
child
sake
emily
ah
yes
if
it
were
simply
to
grovel
in
the
dust
before
him
it
should
be
done
if
humiliation
would
suffice
or
any
that
were
possible
to
me
but
i
should
be
false
if
i
said
that
i
look
forward
to
any
such
possibility
how
can
he
wish
to
have
me
back
again
after
what
he
has
said
and
done
i
am
his
wife
and
he
has
disgraced
me
before
all
men
by
his
own
words
and
what
have
i
done
that
i
should
not
have
done
what
left
undone
on
his
behalf
that
i
should
have
done
it
is
hard
that
the
foolish
workings
of
a
weak
man
mind
should
be
able
so
completely
to
ruin
the
prospects
of
a
woman
life
nora
was
beginning
to
answer
this
by
attempting
to
shew
that
the
husband
madness
was
perhaps
only
temporary
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
outhouse
was
at
once
in
the
room
it
will
be
well
that
the
reader
should
know
what
had
taken
place
at
the
parsonage
while
the
two
sisters
had
been
together
so
that
the
nature
of
outhouse
mission
to
them
may
explain
itself
outhouse
had
been
in
his
closet
when
the
brought
word
to
him
that
trevelyan
was
in
the
parlour
and
was
desirous
of
seeing
him
mr
trevelyan
said
the
unfortunate
clergyman
holding
up
both
his
hands
the
servant
understood
the
tragic
importance
of
the
occasion
quite
as
well
as
did
her
master
and
simply
shook
her
head
has
your
mistress
seen
him
said
the
master
the
girl
again
shook
her
head
ask
your
mistress
to
come
to
me
said
the
clergyman
then
the
girl
disappeared
and
in
a
few
minutes
outhouse
equally
imbued
with
the
tragic
elements
of
the
day
was
with
her
husband
outhouse
began
by
declaring
that
no
consideration
should
induce
him
to
see
trevelyan
and
commissioned
his
wife
to
go
to
the
man
and
tell
him
that
he
must
leave
the
house
when
the
unfortunate
woman
expressed
an
opinion
that
trevelyan
had
some
legal
rights
upon
which
he
might
probably
insist
outhouse
asserted
roundly
that
he
could
have
no
legal
right
to
remain
in
that
parsonage
against
the
will
of
the
rector
if
he
wants
to
claim
his
wife
and
child
he
must
do
it
by
law
not
by
force
and
thank
god
sir
marmaduke
will
be
here
before
he
can
do
that
but
i
ca
make
him
go
said
outhouse
tell
him
that
you
send
for
a
policeman
said
the
clergyman
it
had
come
to
pass
that
there
had
been
messages
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
visitor
and
the
master
of
the
house
all
carried
by
that
unfortunate
lady
trevelyan
did
not
demand
that
his
wife
and
child
should
be
given
up
to
him
did
not
even
on
this
occasion
demand
that
his
boy
should
be
surrendered
to
him
now
at
once
he
did
say
very
repeatedly
that
of
course
he
must
have
his
boy
but
seemed
to
imply
that
under
certain
circumstances
he
would
be
willing
to
take
his
wife
to
live
with
him
again
this
appeared
to
outhouse
to
be
so
manifestly
the
one
thing
that
was
desirable
to
be
the
only
solution
of
the
difficulty
that
could
be
admitted
as
a
solution
at
all
that
she
went
to
work
on
that
hint
and
ventured
to
entertain
a
hope
that
a
reconciliation
might
be
effected
she
implored
her
husband
to
lend
a
hand
to
the
work
by
which
she
intended
to
imply
that
he
should
not
only
see
trevelyan
but
consent
to
meet
the
sinner
on
friendly
terms
but
outhouse
was
on
the
occasion
even
more
than
customarily
obstinate
his
wife
might
do
what
she
liked
he
would
neither
meddle
nor
make
he
would
not
willingly
see
trevelyan
in
his
own
house
unless
indeed
trevelyan
should
attempt
to
force
his
way
up
into
the
nursery
then
he
said
that
which
left
no
doubt
on
his
wife
mind
that
should
any
violence
be
attempted
her
husband
would
manfully
join
the
mêlée
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
no
such
attempt
was
to
be
made
on
that
day
trevelyan
was
lachrymose
heartbroken
and
a
sight
pitiable
to
behold
when
outhouse
loudly
asserted
that
his
wife
had
not
sinned
against
him
in
the
least
not
in
a
tittle
trevelyan
she
repeated
over
and
over
again
he
began
to
assert
himself
declaring
that
she
had
seen
the
man
in
devonshire
and
corresponded
with
him
since
she
had
been
at
diddulph
and
when
the
lady
had
declared
that
the
latter
assertion
was
untrue
he
had
shaken
his
head
and
had
told
her
that
perhaps
she
did
not
know
all
but
the
misery
of
the
man
had
its
effect
upon
her
and
at
last
she
proposed
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
his
wife
he
had
demanded
to
see
his
child
offering
to
promise
that
he
would
not
attempt
to
take
the
boy
by
force
on
this
occasion
saying
also
that
his
claim
by
law
was
so
good
that
no
force
could
be
necessary
it
was
proposed
by
outhouse
that
he
should
first
see
the
mother
and
to
this
he
at
last
assented
how
blessed
a
thing
would
it
be
if
these
two
persons
could
be
induced
to
forget
the
troubles
of
the
last
twelve
months
and
once
more
to
love
and
trust
each
other
but
sir
said
outhouse
putting
her
hand
upon
his
arm
you
must
not
upbraid
her
for
she
will
not
bear
it
she
knows
nothing
of
what
is
due
to
a
husband
said
trevelyan
gloomily
the
task
was
not
hopeful
but
nevertheless
the
poor
woman
resolved
to
do
her
best
and
now
outhouse
was
in
her
niece
room
asking
her
to
go
down
and
see
her
husband
little
louis
had
at
the
time
been
with
the
nurse
and
the
very
moment
that
the
mother
heard
that
the
father
was
in
the
house
she
jumped
up
and
rushed
away
to
get
possession
of
her
treasure
has
he
come
for
baby
nora
asked
in
dismay
then
outhouse
anxious
to
obtain
a
convert
to
her
present
views
boldly
declared
that
trevelyan
had
no
such
intention
trevelyan
came
back
at
once
with
the
boy
and
then
listened
to
all
her
aunt
arguments
but
i
will
not
take
baby
with
me
she
said
at
last
it
was
decided
that
she
should
go
down
alone
and
that
the
child
should
afterwards
be
taken
to
his
father
in
the
outhouse
pledging
herself
that
the
whole
household
should
combine
in
her
defence
if
trevelyan
should
attempt
to
take
the
child
out
of
that
room
but
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
she
asked
say
as
little
as
possible
said
outhouse
except
to
make
him
understand
that
he
has
been
in
error
in
imputing
fault
to
you
he
will
never
understand
that
said
trevelyan
a
considerable
time
elapsed
after
that
before
she
could
bring
herself
to
descend
the
stairs
now
that
her
husband
was
so
near
her
and
that
her
aunt
had
assured
her
that
she
might
reinstate
herself
in
her
position
if
she
could
only
abstain
from
saying
hard
words
to
him
she
wished
that
he
was
away
from
her
again
in
italy
she
knew
that
she
could
not
refrain
from
hard
words
how
was
it
possible
that
she
should
vindicate
her
own
honour
without
asserting
with
all
her
strength
that
she
had
been
and
to
speak
truth
on
the
matter
her
love
for
the
man
which
had
once
been
true
and
eager
had
been
quelled
by
the
treatment
she
had
received
she
had
clung
to
her
love
in
some
shape
in
spite
of
the
accusations
made
against
her
till
she
had
heard
that
the
policeman
had
been
set
upon
her
heels
could
it
be
possible
that
any
woman
should
love
a
man
or
at
least
that
any
wife
should
love
a
husband
after
such
usage
as
that
at
last
she
crept
gently
down
the
stairs
and
stood
at
the
she
listened
and
could
hear
his
steps
as
he
paced
backwards
and
forwards
through
the
room
she
looked
back
and
could
see
the
face
of
the
servant
peering
round
from
the
she
could
not
endure
to
be
watched
in
her
misery
and
thus
driven
she
opened
the
louis
she
said
walking
into
the
room
aunt
mary
has
desired
me
to
come
to
you
emily
he
exclaimed
and
ran
to
her
and
embraced
her
she
did
not
seek
to
stop
him
but
she
did
not
return
the
kiss
which
he
gave
her
then
he
held
her
by
her
hands
and
looked
into
her
face
and
she
could
see
how
strangely
he
was
altered
she
thought
that
she
would
hardly
have
known
him
had
she
not
been
sure
that
it
was
he
she
herself
was
also
changed
who
can
bear
sorrow
without
such
change
till
age
has
fixed
the
lines
of
the
face
or
till
care
has
made
them
hard
and
unmalleable
but
the
effect
on
her
was
as
nothing
to
that
which
grief
remorse
and
desolation
had
made
on
him
he
had
had
no
child
with
him
no
sister
no
friend
bozzle
had
been
his
only
refuge
a
refuge
not
adapted
to
make
life
easier
to
such
a
man
as
trevelyan
and
he
in
spite
of
the
accusations
made
by
himself
against
his
wife
within
his
own
breast
hourly
since
he
had
left
her
had
found
it
to
be
very
difficult
to
satisfy
his
own
conscience
he
told
himself
from
hour
to
hour
that
he
knew
that
he
was
right
but
in
very
truth
he
was
ever
doubting
his
own
conduct
you
have
been
ill
louis
she
said
looking
at
him
ill
at
ease
emily
very
ill
at
ease
a
sore
heart
will
make
the
face
thin
as
well
as
fever
or
ague
since
we
parted
i
have
not
had
much
to
comfort
me
nor
have
i
nor
any
of
us
said
she
how
was
comfort
to
come
from
such
a
parting
then
they
both
stood
silent
together
he
was
still
holding
her
by
the
hand
but
she
was
careful
not
to
return
his
pressure
she
would
not
take
her
hand
away
from
him
but
she
would
show
him
no
sign
of
softness
till
he
should
have
absolutely
acquitted
her
of
the
accusation
he
had
made
against
her
we
are
man
and
wife
he
said
after
awhile
in
spite
of
all
that
has
come
and
gone
i
am
yours
and
you
are
mine
you
should
have
remembered
that
always
louis
i
have
never
forgotten
it
never
in
no
thought
have
i
been
untrue
to
you
my
heart
has
never
changed
since
first
i
gave
it
you
there
came
a
bitter
frown
upon
her
face
of
which
she
was
so
conscious
herself
that
she
turned
her
face
away
from
him
she
still
remembered
her
lesson
that
she
was
not
to
anger
him
and
therefore
she
refrained
from
answering
him
at
all
but
the
answer
was
there
hot
within
her
bosom
had
he
loved
her
and
yet
suspected
that
she
was
false
to
him
and
to
her
vows
simply
because
she
had
been
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
an
old
friend
had
he
loved
her
and
yet
turned
her
from
his
house
had
he
loved
her
and
set
a
policeman
to
watch
her
had
he
loved
her
and
yet
spoken
evil
of
her
to
all
their
friends
had
he
loved
her
and
yet
striven
to
rob
her
of
her
child
will
you
come
to
me
he
said
i
suppose
it
will
be
better
so
she
answered
slowly
then
you
will
promise
me
he
paused
and
attempted
to
turn
her
towards
him
so
that
he
might
look
her
in
the
face
promise
what
she
said
quickly
glancing
round
at
him
and
drawing
her
hand
away
from
him
as
she
did
so
that
all
intercourse
with
colonel
osborne
shall
be
at
an
end
i
will
make
no
promise
you
come
to
me
to
add
one
insult
to
another
had
you
been
a
man
you
would
not
have
named
him
to
me
after
what
you
have
done
to
me
that
is
absurd
i
have
a
right
to
demand
from
you
such
a
pledge
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
you
have
not
have
not
what
that
you
have
not
utterly
disgraced
me
god
in
heaven
that
i
should
hear
this
she
exclaimed
louis
trevelyan
i
have
not
disgraced
you
at
all
in
thought
in
word
in
deed
in
look
or
in
gesture
it
is
you
that
have
disgraced
yourself
and
ruined
me
and
degraded
even
your
own
child
is
this
the
way
in
which
you
welcome
me
certainly
it
is
in
this
way
and
in
no
other
if
you
speak
to
me
of
what
is
past
without
acknowledging
your
error
her
brow
became
blacker
and
blacker
as
she
continued
to
speak
to
him
it
would
be
best
that
nothing
should
be
said
not
a
word
that
it
all
should
be
regarded
as
an
ugly
dream
but
when
you
come
to
me
and
at
once
go
back
to
it
all
and
ask
me
for
a
promise
am
i
to
understand
then
that
all
idea
of
submission
to
your
husband
is
to
be
at
an
end
i
will
submit
to
no
imputation
on
my
honour
even
from
you
one
would
have
thought
that
it
would
have
been
for
you
to
preserve
it
untarnished
and
you
will
give
me
no
assurance
as
to
your
future
life
none
certainly
none
if
you
want
promises
from
me
there
can
be
no
hope
for
the
future
what
am
i
to
promise
that
i
will
not
have
a
lover
what
respect
can
i
enjoy
as
your
wife
if
such
a
promise
be
needed
if
you
should
choose
to
fancy
that
it
had
been
broken
you
would
set
your
policeman
to
watch
me
again
louis
we
can
never
live
together
again
ever
with
comfort
unless
you
acknowledge
in
your
own
heart
that
you
have
used
me
shamefully
were
you
right
to
see
him
in
devonshire
of
course
i
was
right
why
should
i
not
see
him
or
any
one
and
you
will
see
him
again
when
papa
comes
of
course
i
shall
see
him
then
it
is
hopeless
said
he
turning
away
from
her
if
that
man
is
to
be
a
source
of
disquiet
to
you
it
is
hopeless
she
answered
if
you
can
not
so
school
yourself
that
he
shall
be
the
same
to
you
as
other
men
it
is
quite
hopeless
you
must
still
be
mad
as
you
have
been
mad
hitherto
he
walked
about
the
room
restlessly
for
a
time
while
she
stood
with
assumed
composure
near
the
window
send
me
my
child
he
said
at
last
he
shall
come
to
you
louis
for
a
little
but
he
is
not
to
be
taken
out
from
hence
is
that
a
promise
you
are
to
exact
promises
from
me
where
my
own
rights
are
concerned
while
you
refuse
to
give
me
any
though
i
am
entitled
to
demand
them
i
order
you
to
send
the
boy
to
me
is
he
not
my
own
is
he
not
mine
too
and
is
he
not
all
that
you
have
left
to
me
he
paused
again
and
then
gave
the
promise
let
him
be
brought
to
me
he
shall
not
be
removed
now
i
intend
to
have
him
i
tell
you
so
fairly
he
shall
be
taken
from
you
unless
you
come
back
to
me
with
such
assurances
as
to
your
future
conduct
as
i
have
a
right
to
demand
there
is
much
that
the
law
can
not
give
me
it
can
not
procure
submission
love
gratitude
or
even
decent
matronly
conduct
but
that
which
it
can
give
me
i
will
have
she
walked
off
to
the
door
and
then
as
she
was
quitting
the
room
she
spoke
to
him
once
again
alas
louis
she
said
neither
can
the
law
nor
medicine
nor
religion
restore
to
you
that
fine
intellect
which
foolish
suspicions
have
destroyed
then
she
left
him
and
returned
to
the
room
in
which
her
aunt
and
nora
and
the
child
were
all
clustered
together
waiting
to
learn
the
effects
of
the
interview
the
two
women
asked
their
questions
with
their
eyes
rather
than
with
spoken
words
it
is
all
over
said
trevelyan
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
go
back
to
papa
i
only
hear
the
same
accusations
repeated
again
and
again
and
make
myself
subject
to
the
old
insults
then
outhouse
knew
that
she
could
interfere
no
further
and
that
in
truth
nothing
could
be
done
till
the
return
of
sir
marmaduke
should
relieve
her
and
her
husband
from
all
further
active
concern
in
the
matter
but
trevelyan
was
still
waiting
for
the
child
at
last
it
was
arranged
that
nora
should
take
the
boy
into
the
and
that
outhouse
should
fetch
the
father
up
from
the
parlour
to
the
room
above
it
angry
as
was
trevelyan
with
her
husband
not
the
less
was
she
anxious
to
make
the
boy
and
seemly
in
his
father
eyes
she
washed
the
child
face
put
on
him
a
clean
frill
and
a
pretty
ribbon
and
as
she
did
so
she
bade
him
kiss
his
papa
and
speak
nicely
to
him
and
love
him
poor
papa
is
unhappy
she
said
and
louey
must
be
very
good
to
him
the
boy
child
though
he
was
understood
much
more
of
what
was
passing
around
him
than
his
mother
knew
how
was
he
to
love
papa
when
mamma
did
not
do
so
in
some
shape
that
idea
had
framed
itself
in
his
mind
and
as
he
was
taken
down
he
knew
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
speak
nicely
to
his
papa
nora
did
as
she
was
bidden
and
went
down
to
the
outhouse
promising
that
even
if
she
were
put
out
of
the
room
by
trevelyan
she
would
not
stir
from
the
landing
outside
the
door
descended
to
the
parlour
and
quickly
returned
with
the
unfortunate
father
outhouse
in
the
meantime
was
still
sitting
in
his
closet
tormented
with
curiosity
but
yet
determined
not
to
be
seen
till
the
intruder
should
have
left
his
house
i
hope
you
are
well
nora
he
said
as
he
entered
the
room
with
outhouse
quite
well
thank
you
louis
i
am
sorry
that
our
troubles
should
have
deprived
you
of
the
home
you
had
been
taught
to
expect
to
this
nora
made
no
reply
but
escaped
and
went
up
to
her
sister
my
poor
little
boy
said
trevelyan
taking
the
child
and
placing
it
on
his
knee
i
suppose
you
have
forgotten
your
unfortunate
father
the
child
of
course
said
nothing
but
just
allowed
himself
to
be
kissed
he
is
looking
very
well
said
outhouse
is
he
i
dare
say
he
is
well
louey
my
boy
are
you
happy
the
question
was
asked
in
a
voice
that
was
dismal
beyond
compare
and
it
also
remained
unanswered
he
had
been
desired
to
speak
nicely
to
his
papa
but
how
was
it
possible
that
a
child
should
speak
nicely
under
such
a
load
of
melancholy
he
will
not
speak
to
me
said
trevelyan
i
suppose
it
is
what
i
might
have
expected
then
the
child
was
put
off
his
knee
on
to
the
floor
and
began
to
whimper
a
few
months
since
he
would
sit
there
for
hours
with
his
head
upon
my
breast
said
trevelyan
a
few
months
is
a
long
time
in
the
life
of
such
an
infant
said
outhouse
he
may
go
away
said
trevelyan
then
the
child
was
led
out
of
the
room
and
sent
up
to
his
mother
emily
has
done
all
she
can
to
make
the
child
love
your
memory
said
outhouse
to
love
my
memory
what
as
though
i
were
dead
i
will
teach
him
to
love
me
as
i
am
outhouse
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
too
late
will
you
tell
your
husband
from
me
with
my
compliments
that
i
shall
cause
him
to
be
served
with
a
legal
demand
for
the
restitution
of
my
child
but
sir
marmaduke
will
be
here
in
a
few
days
i
know
nothing
of
that
sir
marmaduke
is
nothing
to
me
now
my
child
is
my
own
and
so
is
my
wife
sir
marmaduke
has
no
authority
over
either
one
or
the
other
i
find
my
child
here
and
it
is
here
that
i
must
look
for
him
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
be
troubled
but
the
fault
does
not
rest
with
me
outhouse
has
refused
to
give
me
up
my
own
child
and
i
am
driven
to
take
such
steps
for
his
recovery
as
the
law
has
put
within
my
reach
why
did
you
turn
your
wife
out
of
doors
mr
trevelyan
asked
outhouse
boldly
i
did
not
turn
her
out
of
doors
i
provided
a
fitting
shelter
for
her
i
gave
her
everything
that
she
could
want
you
know
what
happened
that
man
went
down
and
was
received
there
i
defy
you
outhouse
to
say
that
it
was
my
fault
outhouse
did
attempt
to
show
him
that
it
was
his
fault
but
while
she
was
doing
so
he
left
the
house
i
do
think
she
could
go
back
to
him
said
outhouse
to
her
husband
he
is
quite
insane
upon
this
matter
i
shall
be
insane
i
know
said
outhouse
if
sir
marmaduke
does
not
come
home
very
quickly
nevertheless
he
quite
ignored
any
legal
power
that
might
be
brought
to
bear
against
him
as
to
the
restitution
of
the
child
to
its
father
chapter
lxi
parker
hotel
mowbray
street
within
a
week
of
the
occurrence
which
is
related
in
the
last
chapter
there
came
a
telegram
from
southampton
to
the
parsonage
at
diddulph
saying
that
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
had
reached
england
on
the
evening
of
that
day
they
were
to
lodge
at
a
small
family
hotel
in
baker
street
and
both
trevelyan
and
nora
were
to
be
with
them
the
at
the
parsonage
was
painful
as
on
both
sides
there
existed
a
feeling
that
affection
and
sympathy
were
wanting
the
uncle
and
aunt
had
done
their
duty
and
both
trevelyan
and
nora
felt
that
they
ought
to
have
been
demonstrative
and
cordial
in
their
gratitude
but
they
found
it
impossible
to
become
so
and
the
rector
could
not
pretend
but
that
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
his
guests
there
were
too
some
last
words
about
money
to
be
spoken
which
were
grievous
thorns
in
the
poor
man
flesh
two
bank
notes
however
were
put
upon
his
table
and
he
knew
that
unless
he
took
them
he
could
not
pay
for
the
provisions
which
his
unwelcome
visitors
had
consumed
surely
there
never
was
a
man
so
cruelly
as
had
been
outhouse
in
all
this
matter
another
such
winter
as
that
would
put
me
in
my
grave
he
said
when
his
wife
tried
to
comfort
him
after
they
were
gone
i
know
that
they
have
both
been
very
good
to
us
said
trevelyan
as
she
and
her
sister
together
with
the
child
and
the
nurse
hurried
away
towards
baker
street
in
a
cab
but
i
have
never
for
a
moment
felt
that
they
were
glad
to
have
us
but
how
could
they
have
been
glad
to
have
us
she
added
afterwards
when
we
brought
such
trouble
with
us
but
they
to
whom
they
were
going
now
would
receive
her
with
joy
would
make
her
welcome
with
all
her
load
of
sorrows
would
give
to
her
a
sympathy
which
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
receive
from
others
though
she
might
not
be
happy
now
for
in
truth
how
could
she
be
ever
really
happy
again
there
would
be
a
joy
to
her
in
placing
her
child
in
her
mother
arms
and
in
receiving
her
warm
caresses
that
her
father
would
be
very
vehement
in
his
anger
against
her
husband
she
knew
well
for
sir
marmaduke
was
a
vehement
man
but
there
would
be
some
support
for
her
in
the
very
violence
of
his
wrath
and
at
this
moment
it
was
such
support
that
she
most
needed
as
they
journeyed
together
in
the
cab
the
married
sister
seemed
to
be
in
the
higher
spirits
of
the
two
she
was
sure
at
any
rate
that
those
to
whom
she
was
going
would
place
themselves
on
her
side
nora
had
her
own
story
to
tell
about
hugh
stanbury
and
was
by
no
means
so
sure
that
her
tale
would
be
received
with
cordial
agreement
let
me
tell
them
myself
she
whispered
to
her
sister
not
because
they
will
have
so
much
to
say
to
you
but
i
shall
tell
mamma
the
train
by
which
the
rowleys
were
to
reach
london
was
due
at
the
station
at
and
the
two
sisters
timed
their
despatch
from
diddulph
so
as
to
enable
them
to
reach
the
hotel
at
eight
we
shall
be
there
now
before
mamma
said
nora
because
they
will
have
so
much
luggage
and
so
many
things
and
the
trains
are
always
late
when
they
started
from
the
door
of
the
parsonage
outhouse
gave
the
direction
to
the
cabman
gregg
hotel
baker
street
then
at
once
he
began
to
console
himself
in
that
they
were
gone
it
was
a
long
drive
from
diddulph
in
the
east
to
marylebone
in
the
west
of
london

of
the
party
in
the
cab
knew
anything
of
the
region
through
which
they
passed
the
cabman
took
the
line
by
the
back
of
the
bank
and
finsbury
square
and
the
city
road
thinking
it
best
probably
to
avoid
the
crush
at
holborn
hill
though
at
the
expense
of
something
of
a
circuit
but
of
this
trevelyan
and
nora
knew
nothing
had
their
way
taken
them
along
piccadilly
or
through
mayfair
or
across
grosvenor
square
they
would
have
known
where
they
were
but
at
present
they
were
not
thinking
of
those
once
localities
the
cab
passed
the
angel
and
up
and
down
the
hill
at
pentonville
and
by
the
king
cross
stations
and
through
euston
square
and
then
it
turned
up
gower
street
surely
the
man
should
have
gone
on
along
the
new
road
now
that
he
had
come
so
far
out
of
his
way
but
of
this
the
two
ladies
knew
nothing
nor
did
the
nurse
it
was
a
dark
windy
night
but
the
lamps
in
the
streets
had
given
them
light
so
that
they
had
not
noticed
the
night
nor
did
they
notice
it
now
as
the
streets
became
narrower
and
darker
they
were
hardly
thinking
that
their
journey
was
yet
at
an
end
and
the
mother
was
in
the
act
of
covering
her
boy
face
as
he
lay
asleep
on
the
nurse
lap
when
the
cab
was
stopped
nora
looking
out
through
the
window
saw
the
word
hotel
over
a
doorway
and
was
satisfied
shall
i
take
the
child
said
a
man
in
black
and
the
child
was
handed
out
nora
was
the
first
to
follow
and
she
then
perceived
that
the
door
of
the
hotel
was
not
open
trevelyan
followed
and
then
they
looked
round
them
and
the
child
was
gone
they
heard
the
rattle
of
another
cab
as
it
was
carried
away
at
a
gallop
round
a
distant
corner
and
then
some
inkling
of
what
had
happened
came
upon
them
the
father
had
succeeded
in
getting
possession
of
his
child
it
was
a
narrow
dark
street
very
quiet
having
about
it
a
certain
air
of
poor
respectability
an
obscure
noiseless
street
without
even
a
sign
of
life
some
unfortunate
one
had
endeavoured
here
to
keep
an
hotel
but
there
was
no
hotel
kept
there
now
there
had
been
much
craft
in
selecting
the
place
in
which
the
child
had
been
taken
from
them
as
they
looked
around
them
perceiving
the
terrible
misfortune
which
had
befallen
them
there
was
not
a
human
being
near
them
save
the
cabman
who
was
occupied
in
unchaining
or
pretending
to
unchain
the
heavy
mass
of
luggage
on
the
roof
the
windows
of
the
house
before
which
they
were
stopping
were
closed
and
nora
perceived
at
once
that
the
hotel
was
not
inhabited
the
cabman
must
have
perceived
it
also
as
for
the
man
who
had
taken
the
child
the
nurse
could
only
say
that
he
was
dressed
in
black
like
a
waiter
that
he
had
a
napkin
under
his
arm
and
no
hat
on
his
head
he
had
taken
the
boy
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
then
she
had
seen
nothing
further
the
first
thing
that
nora
had
seen
as
she
stood
on
the
pavement
was
the
other
cab
moving
off
rapidly
trevelyan
had
staggered
against
the
railings
and
was
soon
screaming
in
her
wretchedness
before
long
there
was
a
small
crowd
around
them
comprising
three
or
four
women
a
few
boys
an
old
man
or
two
and
a
policeman
to
the
policeman
nora
had
soon
told
the
whole
story
and
the
cabman
was
of
course
attacked
but
the
cabman
played
his
part
very
well
he
declared
that
he
had
done
just
what
he
had
been
told
to
do
nora
was
indeed
sure
that
she
had
heard
her
uncle
desire
him
to
drive
to
gregg
hotel
in
baker
street
the
cabman
in
answer
to
this
declared
that
he
had
not
clearly
heard
the
old
gentleman
directions
but
that
a
man
whom
he
had
conceived
to
be
a
servant
had
very
plainly
told
him
to
drive
to
parker
hotel
mowbray
street
gower
street
i
comed
ever
so
far
out
of
my
way
said
the
cabman
to
avoid
the
rumpus
with
the
homnibuses
at
the
hill
cause
the
ladies
things
is
so
heavy
we
never
got
up
if
the
had
once
jibbed
all
which
though
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
seemed
to
impress
the
policeman
with
the
idea
that
the
cabman
if
not
a
true
man
was
going
to
be
too
clever
for
them
on
this
occasion
and
the
crafty
cabman
went
on
to
declare
that
his
horse
was
so
tired
with
the
load
that
he
could
not
go
on
to
baker
street
they
must
get
another
cab
take
his
number
of
course
they
could
take
his
number
there
was
his
number
his
fare
was
four
and
six
that
is
if
the
ladies
would
pay
him
anything
extra
for
the
terrible
load
and
he
meant
to
have
it
it
would
be
sixpence
more
if
they
kept
him
there
many
minutes
longer
the
number
was
taken
and
another
cab
was
got
and
the
luggage
was
transferred
and
the
money
was
paid
while
the
unhappy
mother
was
still
screaming
in
hysterics
against
the
railings
what
had
been
done
was
soon
clear
enough
to
all
those
around
her
nora
had
told
the
policeman
and
had
told
one
of
the
women
thinking
to
obtain
their
sympathy
and
assistance
the
kid
dada
as
has
taken
it
said
one
man
and
there
nothing
to
be
done
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
nothing
at
any
rate
then
and
there
nora
had
been
very
eager
that
the
cabman
should
be
arrested
but
the
policeman
assured
her
that
such
an
arrest
was
out
of
the
question
and
would
have
been
useless
had
it
been
possible
the
man
would
be
forthcoming
if
his
presence
should
be
again
desired
but
he
had
probably
so
said
the
policeman
really
been
desired
to
drive
to
mowbray
street
they
knows
where
to
find
me
if
they
wants
me
only
i
must
be
paid
my
time
said
the
cabman
confidently
and
the
policeman
was
of
opinion
that
as
the
boy
had
been
kidnapped
on
behalf
of
the
father
no
legal
steps
could
be
taken
either
for
the
recovery
of
the
child
or
for
the
punishment
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
act
he
got
up
however
on
the
box
of
the
cab
and
accompanied
the
party
to
the
hotel
in
baker
street
they
reached
it
almost
exactly
at
the
same
time
with
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
and
the
reader
must
imagine
the
confusion
the
anguish
and
the
disappointment
of
that
meeting
trevelyan
was
hardly
in
possession
of
her
senses
when
she
reached
her
mother
and
could
not
be
induced
to
be
tranquil
even
when
she
was
assured
by
her
father
that
her
son
would
suffer
no
immediate
evil
by
being
transferred
to
his
father
hands
she
in
her
frenzy
declared
that
she
would
never
see
her
little
one
again
and
seemed
to
think
that
the
father
might
not
improbably
destroy
the
child
he
is
mad
papa
and
does
not
know
what
he
does
do
you
mean
to
say
that
a
madman
may
do
as
he
pleases
that
he
may
rob
my
child
from
me
in
the
streets
that
he
may
take
him
out
of
my
very
arms
in
that
way
and
she
was
almost
angry
with
her
father
because
no
attempt
was
made
that
night
to
recover
the
boy
sir
marmaduke
who
was
not
himself
a
good
lawyer
had
been
closeted
with
the
policeman
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
had
learned
the
policeman
views
of
course
the
father
of
the
child
was
the
person
who
had
done
the
deed
whether
the
cabman
had
been
in
the
plot
or
not
was
not
matter
of
much
consequence
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
some
one
had
told
the
man
to
go
to
parker
hotel
as
the
cab
was
starting
and
it
would
probably
be
impossible
to
punish
him
in
the
teeth
of
such
instructions
sir
marmaduke
however
could
doubtless
have
the
cabman
summoned
and
as
for
the
absolute
abduction
of
the
child
the
policeman
was
of
opinion
that
a
father
could
not
be
punished
for
obtaining
possession
of
his
son
by
such
a
stratagem
unless
the
custody
of
the
child
had
been
made
over
to
the
mother
by
some
court
of
law
the
policeman
indeed
seemed
to
think
that
nothing
could
be
done
and
sir
marmaduke
was
inclined
to
agree
with
him
when
this
was
explained
to
trevelyan
by
her
mother
she
again
became
hysterical
in
her
agony
and
could
hardly
be
restrained
from
going
forth
herself
to
look
for
her
lost
treasure
it
need
hardly
be
further
explained
that
trevelyan
had
planned
the
stratagem
in
concert
with
bozzle
bozzle
though
strongly
cautioned
by
his
wife
to
keep
himself
out
of
danger
in
the
matter
was
sorely
tempted
by
his
employer
offer
of
a
hundred
pounds
he
positively
refused
to
be
a
party
to
any
attempt
at
violence
at
diddulph
but
when
he
learned
as
he
did
learn
that
trevelyan
with
her
sister
and
baby
were
to
be
transferred
from
diddulph
in
a
cab
to
baker
street
and
that
the
journey
was
luckily
to
be
made
during
the
shades
of
evening
his
active
mind
went
to
work
and
he
arranged
the
plan
there
were
many
difficulties
and
even
some
pecuniary
difficulty
he
bargained
that
he
should
have
his
hundred
pounds
clear
of
all
deduction
for
expenses
and
then
the
attendant
expenses
were
not
insignificant
it
was
necessary
that
there
should
be
four
men
in
the
service
all
good
and
true
and
men
require
to
be
well
paid
for
such
goodness
and
truth
there
was
the
man
himself
an
who
gave
the
instructions
to
the
first
cabman
as
he
was
starting
the
cabman
would
not
undertake
the
job
at
all
unless
he
were
so
instructed
on
the
spot
asserting
that
in
this
way
he
would
be
able
to
prove
that
the
orders
he
obeyed
came
from
the
lady
husband
and
there
was
the
crafty
with
the
napkin
and
no
hat
who
had
carried
the
boy
to
the
cab
in
which
his
father
was
sitting
and
there
were
the
two
cabmen
bozzle
planned
it
all
and
with
some
difficulty
arranged
the
preliminaries
how
successful
was
the
scheme
we
have
seen
and
bozzle
for
a
month
was
able
to
assume
a
superiority
over
his
wife
which
that
honest
woman
found
to
be
very
disagreeable
there
ai
no
fraudulent
abduction
in
it
at
all
bozzle
exclaimed
because
a
wife
ai
got
no
rights
again
her
husband
not
in
such
a
matter
as
that
bozzle
implied
that
if
her
husband
were
to
take
her
child
away
from
her
without
her
leave
she
let
him
know
something
about
it
but
as
the
husband
had
in
his
possession
the
note
for
a
hundred
pounds
realized
bozzle
had
not
much
to
say
in
support
of
her
view
of
the
case
on
the
morning
after
the
occurrence
while
sir
marmaduke
was
waiting
with
his
solicitor
upon
a
magistrate
to
find
whether
anything
could
be
done
the
following
letter
was
brought
to
trevelyan
at
gregg
hotel
our
child
is
safe
with
me
and
will
remain
so
if
you
care
to
obtain
legal
advice
you
will
find
that
i
as
his
father
have
a
right
to
keep
him
under
my
protection
i
shall
do
so
but
will
allow
you
to
see
him
as
soon
as
i
shall
have
received
a
full
guarantee
that
you
have
no
idea
of
withdrawing
him
from
my
charge
a
home
for
yourself
with
me
is
still
open
to
you
on
condition
that
you
will
give
me
the
promise
that
i
have
demanded
from
you
and
as
long
as
i
shall
not
hear
that
you
again
see
or
communicate
with
the
person
to
whose
acquaintance
i
object
while
you
remain
away
from
me
i
will
cause
you
to
be
paid
a
month
as
i
do
not
wish
that
you
should
be
a
burden
on
others
but
this
payment
will
depend
also
on
your
not
seeing
or
holding
any
communication
with
the
person
to
whom
i
have
alluded
your
affectionate
and
offended
husband
louis
trevelyan
a
letter
addressed
to
the
acrobats
club
will
reach
me
sir
rowley
came
home
dispirited
and
unhappy
and
could
not
give
much
comfort
to
his
daughter
the
magistrate
had
told
him
that
though
the
cabman
might
probably
be
punished
for
taking
the
ladies
otherwise
than
as
directed
if
the
direction
to
baker
street
could
be
proved
nothing
could
be
done
to
punish
the
father
the
magistrate
explained
that
under
a
certain
act
of
parliament
the
mother
might
apply
to
the
court
of
chancery
for
the
custody
of
any
children
under
seven
years
of
age
and
that
the
court
would
probably
grant
such
custody
unless
it
were
shewn
that
the
wife
had
left
her
husband
without
sufficient
cause
the
magistrate
could
not
undertake
to
say
whether
or
no
sufficient
cause
had
here
been
given
or
whether
the
husband
was
in
fault
or
the
wife
it
was
however
clear
that
nothing
could
be
done
without
application
to
the
court
of
chancery
it
appeared
so
said
the
magistrate
that
the
husband
had
offered
a
home
to
his
wife
and
that
in
offering
it
he
had
attempted
to
impose
no
conditions
which
could
be
shown
to
be
cruel
before
a
judge
the
magistrate
thought
that
trevelyan
had
done
nothing
illegal
in
taking
the
child
from
the
cab
sir
marmaduke
on
hearing
this
was
of
opinion
that
nothing
could
be
gained
by
legal
interference
his
private
desire
was
to
get
hold
of
trevelyan
and
pull
him
limb
from
limb
lady
rowley
thought
that
her
daughter
had
better
go
back
to
her
husband
let
the
future
consequences
be
what
they
might
and
the
poor
desolate
mother
herself
had
almost
brought
herself
to
offer
to
do
so
having
in
her
brain
some
idea
that
she
would
after
a
while
be
able
to
escape
with
her
boy
as
for
love
for
her
husband
certainly
there
was
none
now
left
in
her
bosom
nor
could
she
teach
herself
to
think
it
possible
that
she
should
ever
live
with
him
again
on
friendly
terms
but
she
would
submit
to
anything
with
the
object
of
getting
back
her
boy
three
or
four
letters
were
written
to
trevelyan
in
as
many
days
from
his
wife
from
lady
rowley
and
from
nora
in
which
various
overtures
were
made
trevelyan
wrote
once
again
to
his
wife
she
knew
he
said
already
the
terms
on
which
she
might
come
back
these
terms
were
still
open
to
her
as
for
the
boy
he
certainly
should
not
leave
his
father
a
meeting
might
be
planned
on
condition
that
he
trevelyan
were
provided
with
a
written
assurance
from
his
wife
that
she
would
not
endeavour
to
remove
the
boy
and
that
he
himself
should
be
present
at
the
meeting
thus
the
first
week
was
passed
after
sir
marmaduke
return
and
a
most
wretched
time
it
was
for
all
the
party
at
gregg
hotel
chapter
lxii
lady
rowley
makes
an
attempt
illustration
nothing
could
be
more
uncomfortable
than
the
state
of
sir
marmaduke
rowley
family
for
the
first
ten
days
after
the
arrival
in
london
of
the
governor
of
the
mandarin
islands
lady
rowley
had
brought
with
her
two
of
her
girls
the
third
and
fourth
and
as
we
know
had
been
joined
by
the
two
eldest
so
that
there
was
a
large
family
of
ladies
gathered
together
a
house
had
been
taken
in
manchester
street
to
which
they
had
intended
to
transfer
themselves
after
a
single
night
passed
at
gregg
hotel
but
the
trouble
and
sorrow
inflicted
upon
them
by
the
abduction
of
trevelyan
child
and
the
consequent
labours
thrust
upon
sir
marmaduke
shoulders
had
been
so
heavy
that
they
had
slept
six
nights
at
the
hotel
before
they
were
able
to
move
themselves
into
the
house
prepared
for
them
by
that
time
all
idea
had
been
abandoned
of
recovering
the
child
by
any
legal
means
to
be
taken
as
a
consequence
of
the
illegality
of
the
abduction
the
boy
was
with
his
father
and
the
lawyers
seemed
to
think
that
the
father
rights
were
paramount
as
he
had
offered
a
home
to
his
wife
without
any
conditions
which
a
court
of
law
would
adjudge
to
be
cruel
if
she
could
shew
that
he
had
driven
her
to
live
apart
from
him
by
his
own
bad
conduct
then
probably
the
custody
of
her
boy
might
be
awarded
to
her
until
the
child
should
be
seven
years
old
but
when
the
circumstances
of
the
case
were
explained
to
sir
marmaduke
lawyer
by
lady
rowley
that
gentleman
shook
his
head
trevelyan
had
he
said
no
case
with
which
she
could
go
into
court
then
by
degrees
there
were
words
whispered
as
to
the
madness
the
lawyer
said
that
that
was
a
matter
for
the
doctors
if
a
certain
amount
of
medical
evidence
could
be
obtained
to
shew
that
the
husband
was
in
truth
mad
the
wife
could
no
doubt
obtain
the
custody
of
the
child
when
this
was
reported
to
trevelyan
she
declared
that
conduct
such
as
her
husband
must
suffice
to
prove
any
man
to
be
mad
but
at
this
sir
marmaduke
shook
his
head
and
lady
rowley
sat
sadly
silent
with
her
daughter
hand
within
her
own
they
would
not
dare
to
tell
her
that
she
could
regain
her
child
by
that
plea
during
those
ten
days
they
did
not
learn
whither
the
boy
had
been
carried
nor
did
they
know
even
where
the
father
might
be
found
sir
marmaduke
followed
up
the
address
as
given
in
the
letter
and
learned
from
the
porter
at
the
acrobats
that
the
gentleman
letters
were
sent
to
no
stony
walk
union
street
borough
to
this
uncomfortable
locality
sir
marmaduke
travelled
more
than
once
thrice
he
went
thither
intent
on
finding
his
residence
on
the
two
first
occasions
he
saw
no
one
but
bozzle
and
the
discretion
of
that
lady
in
declining
to
give
any
information
was
most
admirable
trewillian
yes
she
had
heard
the
name
certainly
it
might
be
that
her
husband
had
business
engagements
with
a
gent
of
that
name
she
would
not
say
even
that
for
certain
as
it
was
not
her
custom
ever
to
make
any
inquiries
as
to
her
husband
business
engagements
her
husband
business
engagements
were
she
said
much
too
important
for
the
likes
of
she
to
know
anything
about
them
when
was
bozzle
likely
to
be
at
home
bozzle
was
never
likely
to
be
at
home
according
to
her
showing
bozzle
was
of
all
husbands
the
most
erratic
he
might
perhaps
come
in
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
middle
of
the
day
on
a
wednesday
or
perhaps
would
take
a
cup
of
tea
at
home
on
friday
evening
but
anything
so
fitful
and
uncertain
as
were
appearances
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
was
not
to
be
conceived
in
the
mind
of
woman
sir
marmaduke
then
called
in
the
middle
of
the
day
on
wednesday
but
bozzle
was
reported
to
be
away
in
the
provinces
his
wife
had
no
idea
in
which
of
the
provinces
he
was
at
that
moment
engaged
the
persevering
governor
from
the
islands
called
again
on
the
friday
evening
and
then
by
chance
bozzle
was
found
at
home
but
sir
marmaduke
succeeded
in
gaining
very
little
information
even
from
bozzle
the
man
acknowledged
that
he
was
employed
by
trevelyan
any
letter
or
parcel
left
with
him
for
trevelyan
should
be
duly
sent
to
that
gentleman
if
sir
marmaduke
wanted
trevelyan
address
he
could
write
to
trevelyan
and
ask
for
it
if
trevelyan
declined
to
give
it
was
it
likely
that
he
bozzle
should
betray
it
sir
marmaduke
explained
who
he
was
at
some
length
bozzle
with
a
smile
assured
the
governor
that
he
knew
very
well
who
he
was
he
let
drop
a
few
words
to
show
that
he
was
intimately
acquainted
with
the
whole
course
of
sir
marmaduke
family
affairs
he
knew
all
about
the
mandarins
and
colonel
osborne
and
hotel
not
that
he
said
anything
about
parker
hotel
and
the
colonial
office
he
spoke
of
miss
nora
and
even
knew
the
names
of
the
other
two
young
ladies
miss
sophia
and
miss
lucy
it
was
a
weakness
with
bozzle
that
of
displaying
his
information
he
would
have
much
liked
to
be
able
to
startle
sir
marmaduke
by
describing
the
government
house
in
the
island
or
by
telling
him
something
of
his
old
but
of
such
information
as
sir
marmaduke
desired
sir
marmaduke
got
none
and
there
were
other
troubles
which
fell
very
heavily
upon
the
poor
governor
who
had
come
home
as
it
were
for
a
holiday
and
who
was
a
man
hating
work
naturally
and
who
from
the
circumstances
of
his
life
had
never
been
called
on
to
do
much
work
a
man
may
govern
the
mandarins
and
yet
live
in
comparative
idleness
to
do
such
governing
work
well
a
man
should
have
a
good
presence
a
flow
of
words
which
should
mean
nothing
an
excellent
temper
and
a
love
of
hospitality
with
these
attributes
sir
rowley
was
endowed
for
though
his
disposition
was
by
nature
hot
for
governing
purposes
it
had
been
brought
by
practice
under
good
control
he
had
now
been
summoned
home
through
the
machinations
of
his
dangerous
old
friend
colonel
osborne
in
order
that
he
might
give
the
results
of
his
experience
in
governing
before
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
in
coming
to
england
on
this
business
he
had
thought
much
more
of
his
holiday
of
his
wife
and
children
of
his
daughters
at
home
of
his
allowance
per
day
while
he
was
to
be
away
from
his
government
and
of
his
salary
to
be
paid
to
him
entire
during
his
absence
instead
of
being
halved
as
it
would
be
if
he
were
away
on
leave
he
had
thought
much
more
in
coming
home
on
these
easy
and
pleasant
matters
than
he
did
on
the
work
that
was
to
be
required
from
him
when
he
arrived
and
then
it
came
to
pass
that
he
felt
himself
almost
injured
when
the
colonial
office
demanded
his
presence
from
day
to
day
and
when
clerks
bothered
him
with
questions
as
to
which
they
expected
ready
replies
but
in
replying
to
which
sir
marmaduke
was
by
no
means
ready
the
working
men
at
the
colonial
office
had
not
quite
thought
that
sir
marmaduke
was
the
most
fitting
man
for
the
job
in
hand
there
was
a
certain
thomas
smith
at
another
set
of
islands
in
quite
another
part
of
the
world
who
was
supposed
by
these
working
men
at
home
to
be
a
very
paragon
of
a
governor
if
he
had
been
had
home
so
said
the
working
men
no
committee
of
the
house
would
have
been
able
to
make
anything
of
him
they
might
have
asked
him
questions
week
after
week
and
he
would
have
answered
them
all
fluently
and
would
have
committed
nobody
he
knew
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
governing
did
thomas
smith
and
was
a
match
for
the
sharpest
committee
that
ever
sat
at
westminster
poor
sir
marmaduke
was
a
man
of
a
very
different
sort
all
of
which
was
known
by
the
working
men
but
the
parliamentary
interest
had
been
too
strong
and
here
was
sir
marmaduke
at
home
but
the
working
men
were
not
disposed
to
make
matters
so
pleasant
for
sir
marmaduke
as
sir
marmaduke
had
expected
the
committee
would
not
examine
sir
marmaduke
till
after
easter
in
the
middle
of
april
but
it
was
expected
of
him
that
he
should
read
without
number
and
he
was
so
catechised
by
the
working
men
that
he
almost
began
to
wish
himself
back
at
the
mandarins
in
this
way
the
new
establishment
in
manchester
street
was
not
at
first
in
a
happy
or
even
in
a
contented
condition
at
last
after
about
ten
days
lady
rowley
did
succeed
in
obtaining
an
interview
with
trevelyan
a
meeting
was
arranged
through
bozzle
and
took
place
in
a
very
dark
and
gloomy
room
at
an
inn
in
the
city
why
bozzle
should
have
selected
the
bremen
coffee
house
in
alley
for
this
meeting
no
fit
reason
can
surely
be
given
unless
it
was
that
he
conceived
himself
bound
to
select
the
most
dreary
locality
within
his
knowledge
on
so
melancholy
an
occasion
alley
is
a
narrow
dark
passage
somewhere
behind
the
mansion
house
and
the
bremen
coffee
house
why
so
called
no
one
can
now
tell
is
one
of
those
strange
houses
of
public
resort
in
the
city
at
which
the
guests
seem
never
to
eat
never
to
drink
never
to
sleep
but
to
come
in
and
out
after
a
mysterious
and
almost
ghostly
fashion
seeing
their
friends
or
perhaps
their
enemies
in
nooks
and
corners
and
carrying
on
their
conferences
in
low
melancholy
whispers
there
is
an
aged
waiter
at
the
bremen
coffee
house
and
there
is
certainly
one
private
it
was
a
dingy
room
with
an
old
large
mahogany
table
an
old
sofa
six
chairs
two
old
round
mirrors
and
an
old
mahogany
press
in
a
corner
it
was
a
chamber
so
sad
in
its
appearance
that
no
wholesome
useful
work
could
have
been
done
within
it
nor
could
men
have
eaten
there
with
any
appetite
or
have
drained
the
flowing
bowl
with
any
touch
of
joviality
it
was
generally
used
for
such
purposes
as
that
to
which
it
was
now
appropriated
and
no
doubt
had
been
taken
by
bozzle
on
more
than
one
previous
occasion
here
lady
rowley
arrived
precisely
at
the
hour
fixed
and
was
told
that
the
gentleman
was
waiting
for
her
there
had
of
course
been
many
family
consultations
as
to
the
manner
in
which
this
meeting
should
be
arranged
should
sir
marmaduke
accompany
his
wife
or
perhaps
should
sir
marmaduke
go
alone
lady
rowley
had
been
very
much
in
favour
of
meeting
trevelyan
without
any
one
to
assist
her
in
the
conference
as
for
sir
marmaduke
no
meeting
could
be
concluded
between
him
and
his
without
a
personal
and
probably
a
violent
quarrel
of
that
lady
rowley
had
been
quite
sure
sir
marmaduke
since
he
had
been
home
had
in
the
midst
of
his
various
troubles
been
driven
into
so
vehement
a
state
of
indignation
against
his
as
to
be
unable
to
speak
of
the
wretched
man
without
strongest
terms
of
opprobrium
nothing
was
too
bad
to
be
said
by
him
of
one
who
had
his
dearest
daughter
it
must
be
admitted
that
sir
marmaduke
had
heard
only
one
side
of
the
question
he
had
questioned
his
daughter
and
had
constantly
seen
his
old
friend
osborne
the
colonel
journey
down
to
devonshire
had
been
made
to
appear
the
most
natural
proceeding
in
the
world
the
correspondence
of
which
trevelyan
thought
so
much
had
been
shown
to
consist
of
such
notes
as
might
pass
between
any
old
gentleman
and
any
young
woman
the
promise
which
trevelyan
had
endeavoured
to
exact
and
which
trevelyan
had
declined
to
give
appeared
to
the
angry
father
to
be
a
monstrous
insult
he
knew
that
the
colonel
was
an
older
man
than
himself
and
his
emily
was
still
to
him
only
a
young
girl
it
was
incredible
to
him
that
anybody
should
have
regarded
his
old
comrade
as
his
daughter
lover
he
did
not
believe
that
anybody
had
in
truth
so
regarded
the
man
the
tale
had
been
a
monstrous
invention
on
the
part
of
the
husband
got
up
because
he
had
become
tired
of
his
young
wife
according
to
sir
way
of
thinking
trevelyan
should
either
be
thrashed
within
an
inch
of
his
life
or
else
locked
up
in
a
colonel
osborne
shook
his
head
and
expressed
a
conviction
that
the
poor
man
was
mad
but
lady
rowley
was
more
hopeful
though
she
was
as
confident
about
her
daughter
as
was
the
father
she
was
less
confident
about
the
old
friend
she
probably
was
alive
to
the
fact
that
a
man
of
fifty
might
put
on
the
airs
and
assume
the
character
of
a
young
lover
and
acting
on
that
suspicion
entertaining
also
some
hope
that
bad
as
matters
now
were
they
might
be
mended
she
had
taken
care
that
colonel
osborne
and
trevelyan
should
not
be
brought
together
sir
marmaduke
had
fumed
but
lady
rowley
had
been
firm
if
you
think
so
mamma
trevelyan
had
said
with
something
of
scorn
in
her
tone
of
course
let
it
be
so
lady
rowley
had
said
that
it
would
be
better
so
and
the
two
had
not
seen
each
other
since
the
memorable
visit
to
nuncombe
putney
and
now
lady
rowley
was
about
to
meet
her
with
some
slight
hope
that
she
might
arrange
affairs
she
was
quite
aware
that
present
indignation
though
certainly
a
gratification
might
be
indulged
in
at
much
too
great
a
cost
it
would
be
better
for
all
reasons
that
emily
should
go
back
to
her
husband
and
her
home
and
that
trevelyan
should
be
forgiven
for
his
iniquities
bozzle
was
at
the
tavern
during
the
interview
but
he
was
not
seen
by
lady
rowley
he
remained
seated
in
one
of
the
dingy
corners
ready
to
give
assistance
to
his
patron
should
assistance
be
needed
when
lady
rowley
was
shown
into
the
gloomy
by
the
old
waiter
she
found
trevelyan
alone
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
waiting
for
her
this
is
a
sad
occasion
he
said
as
he
advanced
to
give
her
his
hand
a
very
sad
occasion
louis
i
do
not
know
what
you
may
have
heard
of
what
has
occurred
lady
rowley
it
is
natural
however
to
suppose
that
you
must
have
heard
me
spoken
of
with
censure
i
think
my
child
has
been
ill
used
louis
she
replied
of
course
you
do
i
could
not
expect
that
it
should
be
otherwise
when
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
meet
you
here
i
was
quite
aware
that
you
would
have
taken
the
side
against
me
before
you
had
heard
my
story
it
is
i
that
have
been
ill
used
cruelly
misused
but
i
do
not
expect
that
you
should
believe
me
i
do
not
wish
you
to
do
i
would
not
for
worlds
separate
the
mother
from
her
daughter
but
why
have
you
separated
your
own
wife
from
her
child
because
it
was
my
duty
what
is
a
father
not
to
have
the
charge
of
his
own
son
i
have
done
nothing
lady
rowley
to
justify
a
separation
which
is
contrary
to
the
laws
of
nature
where
is
the
boy
louis
ah
that
is
just
what
i
am
not
prepared
to
tell
any
one
who
has
taken
my
wife
side
till
i
know
that
my
wife
has
consented
to
pay
to
me
that
obedience
which
i
as
her
husband
have
a
right
to
demand
if
emily
will
do
as
i
request
of
her
as
i
command
her
as
trevelyan
said
this
he
spoke
in
a
tone
which
was
intended
to
give
the
highest
possible
idea
of
his
own
authority
and
dignity
then
she
may
see
her
child
without
delay
what
is
it
you
request
of
my
daughter
obedience
simply
that
submission
to
my
will
which
is
surely
a
wife
duty
let
her
beg
my
pardon
for
what
has
occurred
she
can
not
do
that
louis
and
solemnly
promise
me
continued
trevelyan
not
deigning
to
notice
lady
rowley
interruption
that
she
will
hold
no
further
intercourse
with
that
snake
in
the
grass
who
wormed
his
way
into
my
house
let
her
be
humble
and
penitent
and
affectionate
and
then
she
shall
be
restored
to
her
husband
and
to
her
child
he
said
this
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
waving
his
hand
as
though
he
were
making
a
speech
that
was
intended
to
be
eloquent
as
though
he
had
conceived
that
he
was
to
overcome
his
by
the
weight
of
his
words
and
the
magnificence
of
his
demeanour
and
yet
his
demeanour
was
ridiculous
and
his
words
would
have
had
no
weight
had
they
not
tended
to
show
lady
rowley
how
little
prospect
there
was
that
she
should
be
able
to
heal
this
breach
he
himself
too
was
so
altered
in
appearance
since
she
had
last
seen
him
bright
with
the
hopes
of
his
young
married
happiness
that
she
would
hardly
have
recognised
him
had
she
met
him
in
the
street
he
was
thin
and
pale
and
haggard
and
mean
and
as
he
stalked
up
and
down
the
room
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
very
character
of
the
man
was
changed
she
had
not
previously
known
him
to
be
pompous
unreasonable
and
absurd
she
did
not
answer
him
at
once
as
she
perceived
that
he
had
not
finished
his
address
and
after
a
moment
pause
he
continued
lady
rowley
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
have
done
for
your
daughter
for
my
wife
all
that
i
had
was
hers
i
did
not
dictate
to
her
any
mode
of
life
i
required
from
her
no
sacrifices
i
subjected
her
to
no
caprices
but
i
was
determined
to
be
master
in
my
own
house
i
do
not
think
louis
that
she
has
ever
denied
your
right
to
be
master
to
be
master
in
my
own
house
and
to
be
paramount
in
my
influence
over
her
so
much
i
had
a
right
to
demand
who
has
denied
your
right
she
has
submitted
herself
to
the
counsels
and
to
the
influences
of
a
man
who
has
endeavoured
to
undermine
me
in
her
affection
in
saying
that
i
make
my
accusation
as
light
against
her
as
is
possible
i
might
make
it
much
heavier
and
yet
not
sin
against
the
truth
this
is
an
illusion
louis
ah
well
no
doubt
it
becomes
you
to
defend
your
child
was
it
an
illusion
when
he
went
to
devonshire
was
it
an
illusion
when
he
corresponded
with
her
contrary
to
my
express
orders
both
before
and
after
that
unhallowed
journey
lady
rowley
there
must
be
no
more
such
illusions
if
my
wife
means
to
come
back
to
me
and
to
have
her
child
in
her
own
hands
she
must
be
penitent
as
regards
the
past
and
obedient
as
regards
the
future
there
was
a
wicked
bitterness
in
that
word
penitent
which
almost
maddened
lady
rowley
she
had
come
to
this
meeting
believing
that
trevelyan
would
be
rejoiced
to
take
back
his
wife
if
details
could
be
arranged
for
his
doing
so
which
should
not
subject
him
to
the
necessity
of
crying
peccavi
but
she
found
him
speaking
of
his
wife
as
though
he
would
be
doing
her
the
greatest
possible
favour
in
allowing
her
to
come
back
to
him
dressed
in
sackcloth
and
with
ashes
on
her
head
she
could
understand
from
what
she
had
heard
that
his
tone
and
manner
were
much
changed
since
he
obtained
possession
of
the
child
and
that
he
now
conceived
that
he
had
his
wife
within
his
power
that
he
should
become
a
tyrant
because
he
had
the
power
to
tyrannise
was
not
in
accordance
with
her
former
conception
of
the
man
character
but
then
he
was
so
changed
that
she
felt
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
man
who
now
stood
before
her
i
can
not
acknowledge
that
my
daughter
has
done
anything
that
requires
penitence
said
lady
rowley
i
dare
say
not
but
my
view
is
different
she
can
not
admit
herself
to
be
wrong
when
she
knows
herself
to
be
right
you
would
not
have
her
confess
to
a
fault
the
very
idea
of
which
has
always
been
abhorrent
to
her
she
must
be
crushed
in
spirit
lady
rowley
before
she
can
again
become
a
pure
and
happy
woman
this
is
more
than
i
can
bear
said
lady
rowley
now
at
last
worked
up
to
a
fever
of
indignation
my
daughter
sir
is
as
pure
a
woman
as
you
have
ever
known
or
are
likely
to
know
you
who
should
have
protected
her
against
the
world
will
some
day
take
blame
to
yourself
as
you
remember
that
you
have
so
cruelly
maligned
her
then
she
walked
away
to
the
door
and
would
not
listen
to
the
words
which
he
was
hurling
after
her
she
went
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
and
at
the
end
of
poulter
alley
found
the
cab
which
was
waiting
for
her
trevelyan
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
rang
the
bell
and
sent
for
bozzle
and
while
the
waiter
was
coming
to
him
and
until
his
myrmidon
had
appeared
he
continued
to
stalk
up
and
down
the
room
waving
his
hand
in
the
air
as
though
he
were
continuing
his
speech
bozzle
said
he
as
soon
as
the
man
had
closed
the
door
i
have
changed
my
mind
as
how
mr
trewillian
i
shall
make
no
further
attempt
i
have
done
all
that
man
can
do
and
have
done
it
in
vain
her
father
and
mother
uphold
her
in
her
conduct
and
she
is
lost
to
me
for
ever
but
the
boy
mr
i
have
my
child
yes
i
have
my
child
poor
infant
bozzle
i
look
to
you
to
see
that
none
of
them
learn
our
retreat
as
for
that
trewillian
why
facts
is
to
be
come
at
by
one
party
pretty
well
as
much
as
by
another
now
suppose
the
things
was
changed
wicey
warsey
and
as
i
was
hacting
for
the
party
d
the
colonel
exclaimed
trevelyan
just
so
trewillian
but
if
i
was
hacting
for
the
other
party
and
they
said
to
me
where
the
boy
why
in
three
days
i
be
down
on
the
facts
facts
is
open
trewillian
if
you
knows
where
to
look
for
them
i
shall
take
him
abroad
at
once
think
twice
of
it
the
boy
is
so
young
you
see
and
a
mother
is
softer
and
lovinger
than
anything
i
think
twice
of
it
before
i
kept
apart
this
was
a
line
of
thought
which
bozzle
conscience
had
not
forced
him
to
entertain
to
the
prejudice
of
his
professional
arrangements
but
now
as
he
conversed
with
his
employer
and
became
by
degrees
aware
of
the
failure
of
trevelyan
mind
some
shade
of
remorse
came
upon
him
and
made
him
say
a
word
on
behalf
of
the
other
party
am
i
not
always
thinking
of
it
what
else
have
they
left
me
to
think
of
that
will
do
for
you
had
better
come
down
to
me
afternoon
bozzle
promised
obedience
to
these
instructions
and
as
soon
as
his
patron
had
started
he
paid
the
bill
and
took
himself
home
lady
rowley
as
she
travelled
back
to
her
house
in
manchester
street
almost
made
up
her
mind
that
the
separation
between
her
daughter
and
her
had
better
be
continued
it
was
a
very
sad
conclusion
to
which
to
come
but
she
could
not
believe
that
any
woman
could
long
continue
to
submit
herself
to
the
caprices
of
a
man
so
unreasonable
and
dictatorial
as
he
to
whom
she
had
just
been
listening
were
it
not
for
the
boy
there
would
she
felt
be
no
doubt
upon
the
matter
and
now
as
matters
stood
she
thought
that
it
should
be
their
great
object
to
regain
possession
of
the
child
then
she
endeavoured
to
calculate
what
would
be
the
result
to
her
daughter
if
in
very
truth
it
should
be
found
that
the
wretched
man
was
mad
to
hope
for
such
a
result
seemed
to
her
to
be
very
wicked
and
yet
she
hardly
knew
how
not
to
hope
for
it
well
mamma
said
emily
trevelyan
with
a
faint
attempt
at
a
smile
you
saw
him
yes
dearest
i
saw
him
i
can
only
say
that
he
is
a
most
unreasonable
man
and
he
would
tell
you
nothing
of
louey
no
dear
not
a
word
chapter
lxiii
sir
marmaduke
at
home
nora
rowley
had
told
her
lover
that
there
was
to
be
no
further
communication
between
them
till
her
father
and
mother
should
be
in
england
but
in
telling
him
so
had
so
frankly
confessed
her
own
affection
for
him
and
had
so
sturdily
promised
to
be
true
to
him
that
no
lover
could
have
been
reasonably
aggrieved
by
such
an
interdiction
nora
was
quite
conscious
of
this
and
was
aware
that
hugh
stanbury
had
received
such
encouragement
as
ought
at
any
rate
to
bring
him
to
the
new
rowley
establishment
as
soon
as
he
should
learn
where
it
had
fixed
itself
but
when
at
the
end
of
ten
days
he
had
not
shown
himself
she
began
to
feel
doubts
could
it
be
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
that
he
was
unwilling
to
encounter
refusal
from
her
father
or
that
he
had
found
on
looking
into
his
own
affairs
more
closely
that
it
would
be
absurd
for
him
to
propose
to
take
a
wife
to
himself
while
his
means
were
so
poor
and
so
precarious
sir
marmaduke
during
this
time
had
been
so
unhappy
so
fretful
so
indignant
and
so
much
worried
that
nora
herself
had
become
almost
afraid
of
him
and
without
much
reasoning
on
the
matter
had
taught
herself
to
believe
that
hugh
might
be
actuated
by
similar
fears
she
had
intended
to
tell
her
mother
of
what
had
occurred
between
her
and
stanbury
the
first
moment
that
she
and
lady
rowley
were
together
but
then
there
had
fallen
upon
them
that
terrible
incident
of
the
loss
of
the
child
and
the
whole
family
had
become
at
once
so
wrapped
up
in
the
agony
of
the
bereaved
mother
and
so
full
of
rage
against
the
unreasonable
father
that
there
seemed
to
nora
to
be
no
possible
opportunity
for
the
telling
of
her
own
emily
herself
appeared
to
have
forgotten
it
in
the
midst
of
her
own
misery
and
had
not
mentioned
hugh
stanbury
name
since
they
had
been
in
manchester
street
we
have
all
felt
how
on
occasions
our
own
hopes
and
fears
nay
almost
our
own
individuality
become
absorbed
in
and
obliterated
by
the
more
pressing
cares
and
louder
voices
of
those
around
us
nora
hardly
dared
to
allude
to
herself
while
her
sister
grief
was
still
so
prominent
and
while
her
father
was
daily
complaining
of
his
own
personal
annoyances
at
the
colonial
office
it
seemed
to
her
that
at
such
a
moment
she
could
not
introduce
a
new
matter
for
dispute
and
perhaps
a
new
subject
of
dismay
nevertheless
as
the
days
passed
by
and
as
she
saw
nothing
of
hugh
stanbury
her
heart
became
sore
and
her
spirit
vexed
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
were
now
deserted
by
him
all
the
world
would
be
over
for
her
the
glascock
episode
in
her
life
had
passed
by
that
episode
which
might
have
been
her
history
which
might
have
been
a
history
so
prosperous
so
magnificent
and
probably
so
happy
as
she
thought
of
herself
and
of
circumstances
as
they
had
happened
to
her
of
the
resolutions
which
she
had
made
as
to
her
own
career
when
she
first
came
to
london
and
of
the
way
in
which
she
had
thrown
all
those
resolutions
away
in
spite
of
the
wonderful
success
which
had
come
in
her
path
she
could
not
refrain
from
thinking
that
she
had
brought
herself
to
shipwreck
by
her
own
indecision
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
she
regretted
what
she
had
done
she
knew
very
well
that
to
have
acted
otherwise
than
she
did
when
glascock
came
to
her
at
nuncombe
putney
would
have
proved
her
to
be
heartless
selfish
and
unwomanly
long
before
that
time
she
had
determined
that
it
was
her
duty
to
marry
a
rich
man
and
if
possible
a
man
in
high
position
such
a
one
had
come
to
her
one
endowed
with
all
the
good
things
of
the
world
beyond
her
most
sanguine
expectation
and
she
had
rejected
him
she
knew
that
she
had
been
right
because
she
had
allowed
herself
to
love
the
other
man
she
did
not
repent
what
she
had
done
the
circumstances
being
as
they
were
but
she
almost
regretted
that
she
had
been
so
soft
in
heart
so
susceptible
of
the
weakness
of
love
so
little
able
to
do
as
she
pleased
with
herself
of
what
use
to
her
was
it
that
she
loved
this
man
with
all
her
strength
of
affection
when
he
never
came
to
her
although
the
time
at
which
he
had
been
told
that
he
might
come
was
now
ten
days
past
she
was
sitting
one
afternoon
in
the
listlessly
reading
or
pretending
to
read
a
novel
when
on
a
sudden
hugh
stanbury
was
announced
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
were
most
unfortunate
for
such
a
visit
sir
marmaduke
who
had
been
down
at
whitehall
in
the
morning
and
from
thence
had
made
a
journey
to
and
back
was
exceedingly
cross
and
out
of
temper
they
had
told
him
at
his
office
that
they
feared
he
would
not
suffice
to
carry
through
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
been
brought
home
and
his
the
parson
had
expressed
to
him
an
opinion
that
he
was
in
great
part
responsible
for
the
misfortune
of
his
daughter
by
the
encouragement
which
he
had
given
to
such
a
man
as
colonel
osborne
sir
marmaduke
had
in
consequence
quarrelled
both
with
the
chief
clerk
and
with
outhouse
and
had
come
home
surly
and
discontented
lady
rowley
and
her
eldest
daughter
were
away
closeted
at
the
moment
with
lady
milborough
with
whom
they
were
endeavouring
to
arrange
some
plan
by
which
the
boy
might
at
any
rate
be
given
back
poor
emily
trevelyan
was
humble
enough
now
to
lady
milborough
was
prepared
to
be
humble
to
any
one
and
in
any
circumstances
so
that
she
should
not
be
required
to
acknowledge
that
she
had
entertained
colonel
osborne
as
her
lover
the
two
younger
girls
sophy
and
lucy
were
in
the
room
when
stanbury
was
announced
as
was
also
sir
marmaduke
who
at
that
very
moment
was
uttering
angry
growls
at
the
obstinacy
and
want
of
reason
with
which
he
had
been
treated
by
outhouse
now
sir
marmaduke
had
not
so
much
as
heard
the
name
of
hugh
stanbury
as
yet
and
nora
though
her
listlessness
was
all
at
an
end
at
once
felt
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
explain
any
of
the
circumstances
of
her
case
in
such
an
interview
as
this
while
however
hugh
dear
steps
were
heard
upon
the
stairs
her
feminine
mind
at
once
went
to
work
to
ascertain
in
what
best
mode
with
what
most
attractive
reason
for
his
presence
she
might
introduce
the
young
man
to
her
father
had
not
the
girls
been
then
present
she
thought
that
it
might
have
been
expedient
to
leave
hugh
to
tell
his
own
story
to
sir
marmaduke
but
she
had
no
opportunity
of
sending
her
sisters
away
and
unless
chance
should
remove
them
this
could
not
be
done
he
is
son
of
the
lady
we
were
with
at
nuncombe
putney
she
whispered
to
her
father
as
she
got
up
to
move
across
the
room
to
welcome
her
lover
now
sir
marmaduke
had
expressed
great
disapproval
of
that
retreat
to
dartmoor
and
had
only
understood
respecting
it
that
it
had
been
arranged
between
trevelyan
and
the
family
in
whose
custody
his
two
daughters
had
been
sent
away
into
banishment
he
was
not
therefore
specially
disposed
to
welcome
hugh
stanbury
in
consequence
of
this
mode
of
introduction
hugh
who
had
asked
for
lady
rowley
and
trevelyan
and
had
learned
that
they
were
out
before
he
had
mentioned
miss
name
was
almost
prepared
to
take
his
sweetheart
into
his
arms
in
that
he
had
taught
himself
to
expect
that
he
would
meet
her
alone
and
had
altogether
forgotten
sir
marmaduke
young
men
when
they
call
at
four
in
the
day
never
expect
to
find
papas
at
home
and
of
sophia
and
lucy
he
had
either
heard
nothing
or
had
forgotten
what
he
had
heard
he
repressed
himself
however
in
time
and
did
not
commit
either
nora
or
himself
by
any
very
vehement
demonstration
of
affection
but
he
did
hold
her
hand
longer
than
he
should
have
done
and
sir
marmaduke
saw
that
he
did
so
this
is
papa
said
nora
papa
this
is
our
friend
hugh
stanbury
the
introduction
was
made
in
a
manner
almost
absurdly
formal
but
poor
nora
difficulties
lay
heavy
upon
her
sir
marmaduke
muttered
something
but
it
was
little
more
than
a
grunt
mamma
and
emily
are
out
continued
nora
i
dare
say
they
will
be
in
soon
sir
marmaduke
looked
round
sharply
at
the
man
why
was
he
to
be
encouraged
to
stay
till
lady
rowley
should
return
lady
rowley
did
not
want
to
see
him
it
seemed
to
sir
marmaduke
in
the
midst
of
his
troubles
that
this
was
no
time
to
be
making
new
acquaintances
these
are
my
sisters
stanbury
continued
nora
this
is
sophia
and
this
is
lucy
sophia
and
lucy
would
have
been
thoroughly
willing
to
receive
their
sister
lover
with
genial
kindness
if
they
had
been
properly
instructed
and
if
the
time
had
been
opportune
but
as
it
was
they
had
nothing
to
say
they
also
could
only
mutter
some
little
sound
intended
to
be
more
courteous
than
their
father
grunt
poor
nora
i
hope
you
are
comfortable
here
said
hugh
the
house
is
all
very
well
said
nora
but
we
do
like
the
neighbourhood
hugh
also
felt
that
conversation
was
difficult
he
had
soon
come
to
perceive
before
he
had
been
in
the
room
half
a
minute
that
the
atmosphere
was
not
favourable
to
his
mission
there
was
to
be
no
embracing
or
permission
for
embracing
on
the
present
occasion
had
he
been
left
alone
with
sir
marmaduke
he
would
probably
have
told
his
business
plainly
let
sir
marmaduke
manner
to
him
have
been
what
it
might
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
do
this
with
three
young
ladies
in
the
room
with
him
seeing
that
nora
was
embarrassed
by
her
difficulties
and
that
nora
father
was
cross
and
silent
he
endeavoured
to
talk
to
the
other
girls
and
asked
them
concerning
their
journey
and
the
ship
in
which
they
had
come
but
it
was
very
work
lucy
and
sophy
could
talk
as
glibly
as
any
young
ladies
home
from
any
colony
and
no
higher
degree
of
fluency
can
be
expressed
but
now
they
were
cowed
their
elder
sister
was
shamefully
and
most
undeservedly
disgraced
and
this
man
had
had
something
they
knew
not
what
to
do
with
it
is
priscilla
quite
well
nora
asked
at
last
quite
well
i
heard
from
her
yesterday
you
know
they
have
left
the
clock
house
i
had
not
heard
it
oh
yes
and
they
are
living
in
a
small
cottage
just
outside
the
village
and
what
else
do
you
think
has
happened
nothing
bad
i
hope
mr
stanbury
my
sister
dorothy
has
left
her
aunt
and
is
living
with
them
again
at
nuncombe
has
there
been
a
quarrel
mr
stanbury
well
yes
after
a
fashion
there
has
i
suppose
but
it
is
a
long
story
and
would
not
interest
sir
marmaduke
the
wonder
is
that
dorothy
should
have
been
able
to
stay
so
long
with
my
aunt
i
will
tell
it
you
all
some
day
sir
marmaduke
could
not
understand
why
a
long
story
about
this
man
aunt
and
sister
should
be
told
to
his
daughter
he
forgot
as
men
always
do
in
such
circumstances
forget
that
while
he
was
living
in
the
mandarins
his
daughter
living
in
england
would
of
course
pick
up
new
interest
and
become
intimate
with
new
histories
but
he
did
not
forget
that
pressure
of
the
hand
which
he
had
seen
and
he
determined
that
his
daughter
nora
could
not
have
any
worse
lover
than
the
friend
of
his
elder
daughter
husband
stanbury
had
just
determined
that
he
must
go
that
there
was
no
possibility
for
him
either
to
say
or
do
anything
to
promote
his
cause
at
the
present
moment
when
the
circumstances
were
all
changed
by
the
return
home
of
lady
rowley
and
trevelyan
lady
rowley
knew
and
had
for
some
days
known
much
more
of
stanbury
than
had
come
to
the
ears
of
sir
marmaduke
she
understood
in
the
first
place
that
the
stanburys
had
been
very
good
to
her
daughter
and
she
was
aware
that
hugh
stanbury
had
thoroughly
taken
her
daughter
part
against
his
old
friend
trevelyan
she
would
therefore
have
been
prepared
to
receive
him
kindly
had
he
not
on
this
very
morning
been
the
subject
of
special
conversation
between
her
and
emily
but
as
it
had
happened
trevelyan
had
this
very
day
told
lady
rowley
the
whole
story
of
nora
love
the
elder
sister
had
not
intended
to
be
treacherous
to
the
younger
but
in
the
thorough
confidence
which
mutual
grief
and
close
conference
had
created
between
the
mother
and
daughter
everything
had
at
last
come
out
and
lady
rowley
had
learned
the
story
not
only
of
hugh
stanbury
courtship
but
of
those
rich
offers
which
had
been
made
by
the
heir
to
the
barony
of
peterborough
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
lady
rowley
was
greatly
grieved
and
thoroughly
dismayed
it
was
not
only
that
glascock
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
peer
but
that
he
was
represented
by
the
poor
suffering
wife
of
the
man
to
be
a
man
blessed
with
a
disposition
sweet
as
an
angel
and
she
would
have
liked
him
emily
had
said
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
unfortunate
young
man
lady
rowley
was
not
worse
than
are
other
mothers
not
more
ambitious
or
more
heartless
or
more
worldly
she
was
a
good
mother
loving
her
children
and
thoroughly
anxious
for
their
welfare
but
she
would
have
liked
to
be
the
of
lord
peterborough
and
she
would
have
liked
dearly
to
see
her
second
daughter
removed
from
the
danger
of
those
rocks
against
which
her
eldest
child
had
been
shipwrecked
and
when
she
asked
after
hugh
stanbury
and
his
means
of
maintaining
a
wife
the
statement
which
trevelyan
made
was
not
comforting
he
writes
for
a
penny
newspaper
and
i
believe
writes
very
well
trevelyan
had
said
for
a
penny
newspaper
is
that
respectable
his
aunt
miss
stanbury
seemed
to
think
not
but
i
suppose
men
of
education
do
write
for
such
things
now
he
says
himself
that
it
is
very
precarious
as
an
employment
it
must
be
precarious
emily
and
has
he
got
nothing
not
a
penny
of
his
own
said
trevelyan
then
lady
rowley
had
thought
again
of
glascock
and
of
the
family
title
and
of
monkhams
and
she
thought
of
her
present
troubles
and
of
the
mandarins
and
the
state
of
sir
marmaduke
balance
at
the
bankers
and
of
the
other
girls
and
of
all
there
was
before
her
to
do
here
had
been
a
very
apollo
among
suitors
kneeling
at
her
feet
and
the
foolish
girl
had
sent
him
away
for
the
sake
of
a
young
man
who
wrote
for
a
penny
newspaper
was
it
worth
the
while
of
any
woman
to
bring
up
daughters
with
such
results
lady
rowley
therefore
when
she
was
first
introduced
to
hugh
stanbury
was
not
prepared
to
receive
him
with
open
arms
on
this
occasion
the
task
of
introducing
him
fell
to
trevelyan
and
was
done
with
much
graciousness
emily
knew
that
hugh
stanbury
was
her
friend
and
would
sympathise
with
her
respecting
her
child
you
have
heard
what
has
happened
to
me
she
said
stanbury
however
had
heard
nothing
of
that
kidnapping
of
the
child
though
to
the
rowleys
it
seemed
that
such
a
deed
of
iniquity
done
in
the
middle
of
london
must
have
been
known
to
all
the
world
he
had
not
as
yet
been
told
of
it
and
now
the
story
was
given
to
him
trevelyan
herself
told
it
with
many
tears
and
an
agony
of
fresh
grief
but
still
she
told
it
as
to
one
whom
she
regarded
as
a
sure
friend
and
from
whom
she
knew
that
she
would
receive
sympathy
sir
marmaduke
sat
by
the
while
still
gloomy
and
out
of
humour
why
was
their
family
sorrow
to
be
laid
bare
to
this
stranger
it
is
the
cruellest
thing
i
ever
heard
said
hugh
a
dastardly
deed
said
lady
rowley
but
we
all
feel
that
for
the
time
he
can
hardly
know
what
he
does
said
nora
and
where
is
the
child
stanbury
asked
we
have
not
the
slightest
idea
said
lady
rowley
i
have
seen
him
and
he
refuses
to
tell
us
he
did
say
that
my
daughter
should
see
her
boy
but
he
now
accompanies
his
offer
with
such
conditions
that
it
is
impossible
to
listen
to
him
and
where
is
he
we
do
not
know
where
he
lives
we
can
reach
him
only
through
a
certain
man
ah
i
know
the
man
said
stanbury
one
who
was
a
policeman
once
his
name
is
bozzle
that
is
the
man
said
sir
marmaduke
i
have
seen
him
and
of
course
he
will
tell
us
nothing
but
what
he
is
told
to
tell
us
continued
lady
rowley
can
there
be
anything
so
horrible
as
this
that
a
wife
should
be
bound
to
communicate
with
her
own
husband
respecting
her
own
child
through
such
a
man
as
that
one
might
possibly
find
out
where
he
keeps
the
child
said
hugh
if
you
could
manage
that
mr
stanbury
said
lady
rowley
i
hardly
see
that
it
would
do
much
good
said
hugh
indeed
i
do
not
know
why
he
should
keep
the
place
a
secret
i
suppose
he
has
a
right
to
the
boy
until
the
mother
shall
have
made
good
her
claim
before
the
court
he
promised
however
that
he
would
do
his
best
to
ascertain
where
the
child
was
kept
and
where
trevelyan
resided
and
then
having
been
nearly
an
hour
at
the
house
he
was
forced
to
get
up
and
take
his
leave
he
had
said
not
a
word
to
any
one
of
the
business
that
had
brought
him
there
he
had
not
even
whispered
an
assurance
of
his
affection
to
nora
till
the
two
elder
ladies
had
come
in
and
the
subject
of
the
taking
of
the
boy
had
been
mooted
he
had
sat
there
as
a
perfect
stranger
he
thought
that
it
was
manifest
enough
that
nora
had
told
her
secret
to
no
one
it
seemed
to
him
that
trevelyan
must
have
forgotten
it
that
nora
herself
must
have
forgotten
it
if
such
forgetting
could
be
possible
he
got
up
however
and
took
his
leave
and
was
comforted
in
some
slight
degree
by
seeing
that
there
was
a
tear
in
nora
eye
who
is
he
demanded
sir
marmaduke
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
he
is
a
young
man
who
was
an
intimate
friend
of
louis
answered
trevelyan
but
he
is
so
no
longer
because
he
sees
how
infatuated
louis
has
been
and
why
does
he
come
here
illustration
and
why
does
he
come
here
we
know
him
very
well
continued
trevelyan
it
was
he
that
arranged
our
journey
down
to
devonshire
he
was
very
kind
about
it
and
so
were
his
mother
and
sister
we
have
every
reason
to
be
grateful
to
mr
stanbury
this
was
all
very
well
but
nora
nevertheless
felt
that
the
interview
had
been
anything
but
successful
has
he
any
profession
asked
sir
marmaduke
he
writes
for
the
press
said
trevelyan
what
do
you
mean
books
no
for
a
newspaper
for
a
penny
newspaper
said
nora
boldly
for
the
daily
record
then
i
hope
he
wo
come
here
any
more
said
sir
marmaduke
nora
paused
a
moment
striving
to
find
words
for
some
speech
which
might
be
true
to
her
love
and
yet
not
unseemly
but
finding
no
such
words
ready
she
got
up
from
her
seat
and
walked
out
of
the
room
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
asked
sir
marmaduke
there
was
a
silence
for
a
while
and
then
he
repeated
his
question
in
another
form
is
there
any
reason
for
his
coming
here
about
nora
i
think
he
is
attached
to
nora
said
trevelyan
my
dear
said
lady
rowley
perhaps
we
had
better
not
speak
about
it
just
now
i
suppose
he
has
not
a
penny
in
the
world
said
sir
marmaduke
he
has
what
he
earns
said
trevelyan
if
nora
understands
her
duty
she
will
never
let
me
hear
his
name
again
said
sir
marmaduke
then
there
was
nothing
more
said
and
as
soon
as
they
could
escape
both
lady
rowley
and
trevelyan
left
the
room
i
should
have
told
you
everything
said
nora
to
her
mother
that
night
i
had
no
intention
to
keep
anything
a
secret
from
you
but
we
have
all
been
so
unhappy
about
louey
that
we
have
had
no
heart
to
talk
of
anything
else
i
understand
all
that
my
darling
and
i
had
meant
that
you
should
tell
papa
for
i
supposed
that
he
would
come
and
i
meant
that
he
should
go
to
papa
himself
he
intended
that
himself
only
as
things
turned
out
just
so
dearest
but
it
does
not
seem
that
he
has
got
any
income
it
would
be
very
rash
would
it
people
must
be
rash
sometimes
everybody
ca
have
an
income
without
earning
it
i
suppose
people
in
professions
do
marry
without
having
fortunes
when
they
have
settled
professions
nora
and
why
is
not
his
a
settled
profession
i
believe
he
receives
quite
as
much
at
seven
and
twenty
as
uncle
oliphant
does
at
sixty
but
your
uncle
oliphant
income
is
permanent
lawyers
do
have
permanent
incomes
or
doctors
or
merchants
but
those
professions
are
regular
and
sure
they
do
marry
without
fortunes
till
they
have
made
their
incomes
sure
stanbury
income
is
sure
i
do
know
why
it
should
be
sure
he
goes
on
writing
and
writing
every
day
and
it
seems
to
me
that
of
all
professions
in
the
world
it
is
the
finest
i
much
sooner
write
for
a
newspaper
than
be
one
of
those
old
musty
fusty
lawyers
who
say
anything
that
they
paid
to
say
my
dearest
nora
all
that
is
nonsense
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
you
should
not
marry
a
man
when
there
is
a
doubt
whether
he
can
keep
a
house
over
your
head
that
is
his
position
it
is
good
enough
for
me
mamma
and
what
is
his
income
from
writing
it
is
quite
enough
for
me
mamma
the
truth
is
i
have
promised
and
i
can
not
go
back
from
it
dear
dear
mamma
you
wo
quarrel
with
us
and
oppose
us
and
make
papa
hard
against
us
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
papa
i
know
that
look
at
poor
emily
plenty
of
money
has
not
made
her
happy
if
glascock
had
only
asked
you
a
week
sooner
said
lady
rowley
with
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
but
you
see
he
did
mamma
when
i
think
of
it
i
can
not
but
weep
and
the
poor
mother
burst
out
into
a
full
flood
of
tears
such
a
man
so
good
so
gentle
and
so
truly
devoted
to
you
mamma
what
the
good
of
that
now
going
down
all
the
way
to
devonshire
after
you
so
did
hugh
mamma
a
position
that
any
girl
in
england
would
have
envied
you
i
can
not
but
feel
it
and
emily
says
she
is
sure
he
would
come
back
if
he
got
the
very
slightest
encouragement
that
is
quite
impossible
mamma
why
should
it
be
impossible
emily
declares
that
she
never
saw
a
man
so
much
in
love
in
her
life
and
she
says
also
that
she
believes
he
is
abroad
now
simply
because
he
is
about
it
glascock
mamma
was
very
nice
and
good
and
all
that
but
indeed
he
is
not
the
man
to
suffer
from
a
broken
heart
and
emily
is
quite
mistaken
i
told
him
the
whole
truth
what
truth
that
there
was
somebody
else
that
i
did
love
then
he
said
that
of
course
that
put
an
end
to
it
all
and
he
wished
me
ever
so
calmly
how
could
you
be
so
infatuated
why
should
you
have
cut
the
ground
away
from
your
feet
in
that
way
because
i
chose
that
there
should
be
an
end
to
it
now
there
has
been
an
end
to
it
and
it
is
much
better
mamma
that
we
should

thing

must
be
surprised
nora

unhappy

is
all
of
course

chapter
lxiv
sir
marmaduke
at
his
club
sir
marmaduke
had
come
away
from
his
the
parson
in
much
anger
for
outhouse
with
that
mixture
of
obstinacy
and
honesty
which
formed
his
character
had
spoken
hard
words
of
colonel
osborne
and
words
which
by
implication
had
been
hard
also
against
emily
trevelyan
he
had
been
very
staunch
to
his
niece
when
attacked
by
his
niece
husband
but
when
his
sympathies
and
assistance
were
invoked
by
sir
marmaduke
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
transferred
his
allegiance
to
the
other
side
he
pointed
out
to
the
unhappy
father
that
colonel
osborne
had
behaved
with
great
cruelty
in
going
to
devonshire
that
the
stanburys
had
been
untrue
to
their
trust
in
allowing
him
to
enter
the
house
and
that
emily
had
been
indiscreet
in
receiving
him
when
a
young
woman
is
called
indiscreet
by
her
friends
it
may
be
assumed
that
her
character
is
very
seriously
assailed
sir
marmaduke
had
understood
this
and
on
hearing
the
word
had
become
wroth
with
his
there
had
been
hot
words
between
them
and
outhouse
would
not
yield
an
inch
or
retract
a
syllable
he
conceived
it
to
be
his
duty
to
advise
the
father
to
caution
his
daughter
with
severity
to
quarrel
absolutely
with
colonel
osborne
and
to
let
trevelyan
know
that
this
had
been
done
as
to
the
child
outhouse
expressed
a
strong
opinion
that
the
father
was
legally
entitled
to
the
custody
of
his
boy
and
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
recover
the
child
except
what
might
be
done
with
the
father
consent
in
fact
outhouse
made
himself
exceedingly
disagreeable
and
sent
away
sir
marmaduke
with
a
very
heavy
heart
could
it
really
be
possible
that
his
old
friend
fred
osborne
who
seven
or
years
ago
had
been
potent
among
young
ladies
had
really
been
making
love
to
his
old
married
daughter
sir
marmaduke
looked
into
himself
and
conceived
it
to
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
make
love
to
any
one
a
good
dinner
good
wine
a
good
cigar
an
easy
chair
and
a
rubber
of
whist
all
these
things
with
no
work
to
do
and
men
of
his
own
standing
around
him
were
the
pleasures
of
life
which
sir
marmaduke
desired
now
fred
osborne
was
an
older
man
than
he
and
though
fred
osborne
did
keep
up
a
foolish
system
of
padded
clothes
and
dyed
whiskers
still
at
or
surely
a
man
might
be
reckoned
safe
and
then
too
that
ancient
friendship
sir
marmaduke
who
had
lived
all
his
life
in
the
comparative
seclusion
of
a
colony
thought
perhaps
more
of
that
ancient
friendship
than
did
the
colonel
who
had
lived
amidst
the
blaze
of
london
life
and
who
had
had
many
opportunities
of
changing
his
friends
some
inkling
of
all
this
made
its
way
into
sir
marmaduke
bosom
as
he
thought
of
it
with
bitterness
and
he
determined
that
he
would
have
it
out
with
his
friend
hitherto
he
had
enjoyed
very
few
of
those
pleasant
hours
which
he
had
anticipated
on
his
journey
homewards
he
had
had
no
heart
to
go
to
his
club
and
he
had
fancied
that
colonel
osborne
had
been
a
little
backward
in
looking
him
up
and
providing
him
with
amusement
he
had
suggested
this
to
his
wife
and
she
had
told
him
that
the
colonel
had
been
right
not
to
come
to
manchester
street
i
have
told
emily
said
lady
rowley
that
she
must
not
meet
him
and
she
is
quite
of
the
same
opinion
nevertheless
there
had
been
remissness
sir
marmaduke
felt
that
it
was
so
in
spite
of
his
wife
excuses
in
this
way
he
was
becoming
sore
with
everybody
and
very
unhappy
it
did
not
at
all
improve
his
temper
when
he
was
told
that
his
second
daughter
had
refused
an
offer
from
lord
peterborough
eldest
son
then
she
may
go
into
the
workhouse
for
me
the
angry
father
had
said
declaring
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
never
give
his
consent
to
her
marriage
with
the
man
who
did
dirty
work
for
the
daily
record
as
he
with
his
paternal
wisdom
chose
to
express
it
but
this
cruel
phrase
was
not
spoken
in
nora
hearing
nor
was
it
repeated
to
her
lady
rowley
knew
her
husband
and
was
aware
that
he
would
on
occasions
change
his
opinion
it
was
not
till
two
or
three
days
after
his
visit
to
that
he
met
colonel
osborne
the
easter
recess
was
then
over
and
colonel
osborne
had
just
returned
to
london
they
met
on
the
of
the
acrobats
and
the
colonel
immediately
began
with
an
apology
i
have
been
so
sorry
to
be
away
just
when
you
are
here
upon
my
word
i
have
but
i
was
obliged
to
go
down
to
the
duchess
i
had
promised
early
in
the
winter
and
those
people
are
so
angry
if
you
put
them
off
by
george
it
almost
as
bad
as
putting
off
royalty
d
n
the
duchess
said
sir
marmaduke
with
all
my
heart
said
the
colonel
only
i
thought
it
as
well
that
i
should
tell
you
the
truth
what
i
mean
is
that
the
duchess
and
her
people
make
no
difference
to
me
i
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
time
that
all
well
yes
we
had
one
must
get
away
somewhere
at
easter
there
is
no
one
left
at
the
club
and
there
no
house
and
no
one
asks
one
to
dinner
in
town
in
fact
if
one
did
go
away
one
would
know
what
to
do
there
were
ever
so
many
people
there
that
i
liked
to
meet
lady
glencora
was
there
and
uncommon
pleasant
she
made
it
that
woman
has
more
to
say
for
herself
than
any
men
that
i
know
and
lord
cantrip
your
chief
was
there
he
said
a
word
or
two
to
me
about
you
what
sort
of
a
word
he
says
he
wishes
you
would
read
up
some
or
papers
or
reports
or
something
of
that
kind
which
he
says
that
some
of
his
fellows
have
sent
you
it
seems
that
there
are
some
new
rules
or
orders
or
fashions
which
he
wants
you
to
have
at
your
ends
nothing
could
be
more
civil
than
he
was
but
he
just
wished
me
to
mention
this
knowing
that
you
and
i
are
likely
to
see
each
other
i
wish
i
had
never
come
over
said
sir
marmaduke
why
so
they
did
bother
me
with
their
new
rules
and
fashions
over
there
when
the
papers
came
somebody
read
them
and
that
was
enough
i
could
do
what
they
wanted
me
to
do
there
and
so
you
will
here
after
a
bit
i
not
so
sure
of
that
those
young
fellows
seem
to
forget
that
an
old
dog
ca
learn
new
tricks
they
got
a
young
brisk
fellow
there
who
seems
to
think
that
a
man
should
be
an
encyclopedia
of
knowledge
because
he
has
lived
in
a
colony
over
twenty
years
that
the
new
never
mind
who
it
is
osborne
just
come
up
to
the
library
will
you
i
want
to
speak
to
you
then
sir
marmaduke
with
considerable
solemnity
led
the
way
up
to
the
most
deserted
room
in
the
club
and
colonel
osborne
followed
him
well
knowing
that
something
was
to
be
said
about
emily
trevelyan
sir
marmaduke
seated
himself
on
a
sofa
and
his
friend
sat
close
beside
him
the
room
was
quite
deserted
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
and
the
club
was
full
of
men
there
were
men
in
the
and
men
in
the
and
men
in
the
and
men
in
the
but
no
better
choice
of
a
chamber
for
a
conference
intended
to
be
silent
and
secret
could
have
been
made
in
all
london
than
that
which
had
induced
sir
marmaduke
to
take
his
friend
into
the
library
of
the
acrobats
and
yet
a
great
deal
of
money
had
been
spent
in
providing
this
library
for
the
acrobats
sir
marmaduke
sat
for
awhile
silent
and
had
he
sat
silent
for
an
hour
colonel
osborne
would
not
have
interrupted
him
then
at
last
he
began
with
a
voice
that
was
intended
to
be
serious
but
which
struck
upon
the
ear
of
his
companion
as
being
affected
and
unlike
the
owner
of
it
this
is
a
very
sad
thing
about
my
poor
girl
said
sir
marmaduke
indeed
it
is
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
said
about
it
rowley
and
what
that
the
man
must
be
mad
he
is
not
so
mad
as
to
give
us
any
relief
by
his
madness
poor
as
such
comfort
would
be
he
has
got
emily
child
away
from
her
and
i
think
it
will
about
kill
her
and
what
is
to
become
of
her
as
to
taking
her
back
to
the
islands
without
her
child
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
never
knew
anything
so
cruel
in
my
life
and
so
absurd
you
know
ah
that
just
the
question
if
anybody
had
asked
me
i
should
have
said
that
you
were
the
man
of
all
men
whom
i
could
have
best
trusted
do
you
doubt
it
now
i
do
know
what
to
think
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
suspect
me
and
your
daughter
too
no
by
heavens
poor
dear
if
i
suspected
her
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
things
with
me
i
could
never
get
over
that
no
i
suspect
her
sir
marmaduke
had
now
dropped
his
affected
tone
and
was
speaking
with
natural
energy
but
you
do
me
no
if
i
did
i
do
suppose
i
should
be
sitting
with
you
here
but
they
tell
me
they
tell
you
what
they
tell
me
that
that
you
did
not
behave
wisely
about
it
why
could
you
not
let
her
alone
when
you
found
out
how
matters
were
going
who
has
been
telling
you
this
rowley
sir
marmaduke
considered
for
awhile
and
then
remembering
that
colonel
osborne
could
hardly
quarrel
with
a
clergyman
told
him
the
truth
outhouse
says
that
you
have
done
her
an
irretrievable
injury
by
going
down
to
devonshire
to
her
and
by
writing
to
her
outhouse
is
an
ass
that
is
easily
said
but
why
did
you
go
and
why
should
i
not
go
what
the
deuce
because
a
man
like
that
chooses
to
take
vagaries
into
his
head
i
am
not
to
see
my
own
godchild
sir
marmaduke
tried
to
remember
whether
the
colonel
was
in
fact
the
godfather
of
his
eldest
daughter
but
he
found
that
his
mind
was
quite
a
blank
about
his
children
godfathers
and
godmothers
and
as
for
the
letters
i
wish
you
could
see
them
the
only
letters
which
had
in
them
a
word
of
importance
were
those
about
your
coming
home
i
was
anxious
to
get
that
arranged
not
only
for
your
sake
but
because
she
was
so
eager
about
it
god
bless
her
poor
child
said
sir
marmaduke
rubbing
the
tears
away
from
his
eyes
with
his
red
silk
i
will
acknowledge
that
those
letters
there
may
have
been
one
or
two
were
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
it
was
these
that
made
this
man
show
himself
to
be
a
lunatic
i
do
admit
that
i
was
bound
not
to
talk
about
your
coming
and
i
told
her
to
keep
the
secret
he
went
spying
about
and
found
her
letters
i
suppose
and
then
he
took
fire
because
there
was
to
be
a
secret
from
him
dirty
mean
dog
and
now
i
to
be
told
by
such
a
fellow
as
outhouse
that
it
my
fault
that
i
have
caused
all
the
trouble
because
when
i
happened
to
be
in
devonshire
i
went
to
see
your
daughter
we
must
do
the
colonel
the
justice
of
supposing
that
he
had
by
this
time
quite
taught
himself
to
believe
that
the
church
porch
at
cockchaffington
had
been
the
motive
cause
of
his
journey
into
devonshire
upon
my
word
it
is
too
hard
continued
he
indignantly
as
for
outhouse
only
for
the
gown
upon
his
back
i
pull
his
nose
and
i
wish
that
you
would
tell
him
that
i
say
so
there
is
trouble
enough
without
that
said
sir
marmaduke
but
it
is
hard
by
g
it
is
hard
there
is
this
comfort
if
it
had
been
me
it
would
have
been
some
one
else
such
a
man
as
that
could
have
gone
two
or
three
years
without
being
jealous
of
some
one
and
as
for
poor
emily
she
is
better
off
perhaps
with
an
accusation
so
absurd
as
this
than
she
might
have
been
had
her
name
been
joined
with
a
younger
man
or
with
one
whom
you
would
have
less
reason
for
trusting
there
was
so
much
that
seemed
to
be
sensible
in
this
and
it
was
spoken
with
so
well
assumed
a
tone
of
injured
innocence
that
sir
marmaduke
felt
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
he
muttered
something
further
about
the
cruelty
of
the
case
and
then
slunk
away
out
of
the
club
and
made
his
way
home
to
the
dull
gloomy
house
in
manchester
street
there
was
no
comfort
for
him
there
but
neither
was
there
any
comfort
for
him
at
the
club
and
why
did
that
vexatious
secretary
of
state
send
him
messages
about
blue
books
as
he
went
he
expressed
sundry
wishes
that
he
was
back
at
the
mandarins
and
told
himself
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
remain
there
till
he
died

about

she
spoke

did
she
say
much
in
condemnation
of
her
lover
to
french
till
the
blow
came
with
unremitting
attention
she
pursued
the
great
business
of
her
wedding
garments
and
exacted
from
the
unfortunate
arabella
an
amount
of
work
equal
to
her
own
of
thankless
work
as
is
the
custom
of
embryo
brides
with
their
unmarried
sisters
and
she
drew
with
great
audacity
on
the
somewhat
slender
means
of
the
family
for
the
amount
of
feminine
gear
necessary
to
enable
her
to
go
into
gibson
house
with
something
of
the
éclat
of
a
bride
when
french
hesitated
and
then
expostulated
camilla
replied
that
she
did
not
expect
to
be
married
above
once
and
that
in
no
cheaper
or
more
productive
way
than
this
could
her
mother
allow
her
to
consume
her
share
of
the
family
resources
what
matter
mamma
if
you
do
have
to
borrow
a
little
money
burgess
will
let
you
have
it
when
he
knows
why
and
as
i
sha
be
eating
and
drinking
at
home
any
more
nor
yet
getting
my
things
here
i
have
a
right
to
expect
it
and
she
ended
by
expressing
an
opinion
in
arabella
hearing
that
any
daughter
of
a
house
who
proves
herself
to
be
capable
of
getting
a
husband
for
herself
is
entitled
to
expect
that
those
left
at
home
shall
pinch
themselves
for
a
time
in
order
that
she
may
go
forth
to
the
world
in
a
respectable
way
and
be
a
credit
to
the
family
then
came
the
blow
gibson
had
not
been
at
the
house
for
some
days
but
the
notes
had
been
going
and
coming
at
last
gibson
came
himself
but
as
it
happened
when
he
came
camilla
was
out
shopping
in
these
days
she
often
did
go
out
shopping
between
eleven
and
one
carrying
her
sister
with
her
it
must
have
been
but
a
poor
pleasure
for
arabella
this
witnessing
the
purchases
made
seeing
the
pleasant
draperies
and
handling
the
real
linens
and
admiring
the
fine
cambrics
spread
out
before
them
on
the
shop
counters
by
obsequious
attendants
and
the
questions
asked
of
her
by
her
sister
whether
this
was
good
enough
for
so
august
an
occasion
or
that
sufficiently
handsome
must
have
been
harassing
she
could
not
have
failed
to
remember
that
it
ought
all
to
have
been
done
for
her
that
had
she
not
been
treated
with
monstrous
injustice
with
most
unsisterly
cruelty
all
these
good
things
would
have
been
spread
on
her
behoof
but
she
went
on
and
endured
it
and
worked
diligently
with
her
needle
and
folded
and
unfolded
as
she
was
desired
and
became
as
it
were
quite
a
younger
sister
in
the
house
creeping
out
by
herself
now
and
again
into
the
purlieus
of
the
city
to
find
such
consolation
as
she
might
receive
from
her
solitary
thoughts
but
arabella
and
camilla
were
both
away
when
gibson
called
to
tell
french
of
his
altered
plans
and
as
he
asked
not
for
his
but
for
french
herself
it
is
probable
that
he
watched
his
opportunity
and
that
he
knew
to
what
cares
his
camilla
was
then
devoting
herself
perhaps
it
is
quite
as
well
that
i
should
find
you
alone
he
said
after
sundry
preludes
to
his
future
because
you
can
make
camilla
understand
this
better
than
i
can
i
must
put
off
the
day
for
about
three
weeks
three
weeks
mr
gibson
or
a
month
perhaps
we
had
better
say
the
of
april
gibson
had
by
this
time
thrown
off
every
fear
that
he
might
have
entertained
of
the
mother
and
could
speak
to
her
of
such
an
unwarrantable
change
of
plans
with
tolerable
equanimity
but
i
do
know
that
that
will
suit
camilla
at
all
she
can
name
any
other
day
she
pleases
of
course
that
is
in
may
but
why
is
this
to
be
there
are
things
about
money
french
which
i
can
not
arrange
sooner
and
i
find
that
unfortunately
i
must
go
up
to
london
though
many
other
questions
were
asked
nothing
further
was
got
out
of
gibson
on
that
occasion
and
he
left
the
house
with
a
perfect
understanding
on
his
own
part
and
on
that
of
french
that
the
marriage
was
postponed
till
some
day
still
to
be
fixed
but
which
could
not
and
should
not
be
before
the
of
april
french
asked
him
why
he
did
not
come
up
and
see
camilla
he
replied
false
man
that
he
was
that
he
had
hoped
to
have
seen
her
this
morning
and
that
he
would
come
again
before
the
week
was
over
then
it
was
that
camilla
spoke
her
mind
out
plainly
i
shall
go
to
his
house
at
once
she
said
and
find
out
all
about
it
i
understand
it
i
do
understand
it
at
all
and
i
wo
put
up
with
it
he
shall
know
who
he
has
to
deal
with
if
he
plays
tricks
upon
me
mamma
i
wonder
you
let
him
out
of
the
house
till
you
had
made
him
come
back
to
his
old
day
what
could
i
do
my
dear
what
could
you
do
shake
him
out
of
it
as
i
would
have
done
but
he
did
dare
to
tell
me
because
he
is
a
coward
camilla
in
all
this
showed
her
spirit
but
she
allowed
her
anger
to
hurry
her
away
into
an
indiscretion
arabella
was
present
and
camilla
should
have
repressed
her
rage
i
do
think
he
at
all
a
coward
said
arabella
that
my
business
i
suppose
i
entitled
to
know
what
he
is
better
than
you
all
the
same
i
do
think
gibson
is
at
all
a
coward
said
arabella
again
pleading
the
cause
of
the
man
who
had
misused
her
now
arabella
i
wo
take
any
interference
from
you
mind
that
i
say
it
was
cowardly
and
he
should
have
come
to
me
it
my
concern
and
i
shall
go
to
him
i
not
going
to
be
stopped
by
any
nonsense
when
my
future
respectability
perhaps
is
at
stake
all
exeter
knows
that
the
marriage
is
to
take
place
on
the
of
this
month
on
the
next
day
camilla
absolutely
did
go
to
gibson
house
at
an
early
hour
at
nine
when
as
she
thought
he
would
surely
be
at
breakfast
but
he
had
flown
he
had
left
exeter
that
morning
by
an
early
train
and
his
servant
thought
that
he
had
gone
to
london
on
the
next
morning
camilla
got
a
note
from
him
written
in
london
it
affected
to
be
very
cheery
and
affectionate
beginning
dearest
cammy
and
alluding
to
the
postponement
of
his
wedding
as
though
it
were
a
thing
so
fixed
as
to
require
no
further
question
camilla
answered
this
letter
still
in
much
wrath
complaining
protesting
expostulating
throwing
in
his
teeth
the
fact
that
the
day
had
been
fixed
by
him
and
not
by
her
and
she
added
a
postscript
in
the
following
momentous
words
if
you
have
any
respect
for
the
name
of
your
future
wife
you
will
fall
back
upon
your
first
arrangement
to
this
she
got
simply
a
line
of
an
answer
declaring
that
this
falling
back
was
impossible
and
then
nothing
was
heard
of
him
for
ten
days
he
had
gone
from
tuesday
to
saturday
week
and
the
first
that
camilla
saw
of
him
was
his
presence
in
the
reading
desk
when
he
chaunted
the
cathedral
service
as
on
the
sunday
at
this
time
arabella
was
very
ill
and
was
confined
to
her
bed
martin
declared
that
her
system
had
become
low
from
over
anxiety
that
she
was
nervous
weak
and
liable
to
hysterics
that
her
feelings
were
in
fact
too
many
for
her
and
that
her
efforts
to
overcome
them
and
to
face
the
realities
of
the
world
had
exhausted
her
this
was
of
course
not
said
openly
at
the
of
exeter
but
such
was
the
opinion
which
martin
gave
in
confidence
to
the
mother
said
camilla
when
she
was
told
of
feelings
susceptibilities
and
hysterics
at
the
present
moment
she
had
a
claim
to
the
undivided
interest
of
the
family
and
she
believed
that
her
sister
illness
was
feigned
in
order
to
defraud
her
of
her
rights
my
dear
she
is
ill
said
french
then
let
her
have
a
dose
of
salts
said
the
stern
camilla
this
was
on
the
sunday
afternoon
camilla
had
endeavoured
to
see
gibson
as
he
came
out
of
the
cathedral
but
had
failed
gibson
had
been
detained
within
the
building
no
doubt
by
duties
connected
with
the
choral
services
on
that
evening
he
got
a
note
from
camilla
and
quite
early
on
the
monday
morning
he
came
up
to
heavitree
you
will
find
her
in
the
said
french
as
she
opened
the
for
him
there
was
a
smile
on
her
face
as
she
spoke
but
it
was
a
forced
smile
gibson
did
not
smile
at
all
is
it
all
right
with
her
he
asked
well
you
had
better
go
to
her
you
see
gibson
young
ladies
when
they
are
going
to
be
married
think
that
they
ought
to
have
their
own
way
a
little
just
for
the
last
time
you
know
he
took
no
notice
of
the
joke
but
went
with
slow
steps
up
to
the
it
would
be
inquiring
too
curiously
to
ask
whether
camilla
when
she
embraced
him
discerned
that
he
had
fortified
his
courage
that
morning
with
a
glass
of
curacoa
what
does
all
this
mean
thomas
was
the
first
question
that
camilla
asked
when
the
embrace
was
over
all
what
mean
dear
this
untoward
delay
thomas
you
have
almost
broken
my
heart
you
have
been
away
and
i
have
not
heard
from
you
i
wrote
twice
camilla
and
what
sort
of
letters
if
there
is
anything
the
matter
thomas
you
had
better
tell
me
at
once
she
paused
but
thomas
held
his
tongue
i
do
suppose
you
want
to
kill
me
god
forbid
said
thomas
but
you
will
what
must
everybody
think
of
me
in
the
city
when
they
find
that
it
is
put
off
poor
mamma
has
been
dreadful
quite
dreadful
and
here
is
arabella
now
laid
up
on
a
bed
of
sickness
this
too
was
indiscreet
camilla
should
have
said
nothing
about
her
sister
sickness
i
have
been
so
sorry
to
hear
about
dear
bella
said
gibson
i
do
suppose
she
very
bad
said
camilla
but
of
course
we
all
feel
it
of
course
we
upset
as
for
me
i
bear
up
because
that
spirit
that
i
wo
give
way
if
it
ever
so
but
upon
my
word
it
tries
me
hard
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
thomas
but
thomas
had
nothing
to
say
beyond
what
he
had
said
before
to
french
he
was
very
particular
he
said
about
money
and
certain
money
matters
made
it
incumbent
on
him
not
to
marry
before
the
of
april
when
camilla
suggested
to
him
that
as
she
was
to
be
his
wife
she
ought
to
know
all
about
his
money
matters
he
told
her
that
she
should
some
day
when
they
were
married
he
would
tell
her
all
camilla
talked
a
great
deal
and
said
some
things
that
were
very
severe
gibson
did
not
enjoy
his
morning
but
he
endured
the
upbraidings
of
his
fair
one
with
more
firmness
than
might
perhaps
have
been
expected
from
him
he
left
all
the
talking
to
camilla
but
when
he
got
up
to
leave
her
the
of
april
had
been
fixed
with
some
sort
of
assent
from
her
as
the
day
on
which
she
was
really
to
become
gibson
when
he
left
the
room
he
again
met
french
on
the
she
hesitated
a
moment
waiting
to
see
whether
the
door
would
be
shut
but
the
door
could
not
be
shut
as
camilla
was
standing
in
the
entrance
gibson
said
french
in
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
a
whisper
would
you
mind
stepping
in
and
seeing
poor
bella
for
a
moment
why
she
is
in
bed
said
camilla
yes
she
is
in
bed
but
she
thinks
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
her
she
has
seen
nobody
these
four
days
except
martin
and
she
thinks
it
would
comfort
her
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
mr
gibson
now
gibson
was
not
only
going
to
be
bella
but
he
was
also
a
clergyman
camilla
in
her
heart
believed
that
the
aspect
which
her
mother
had
given
to
the
request
was
false
and
hypocritical
there
were
special
reasons
why
bella
should
not
have
wished
to
see
gibson
in
her
bedroom
at
any
rate
till
gibson
had
become
her
the
expression
of
such
a
wish
at
the
present
moment
was
almost
indecent
you
be
there
with
them
said
camilla
gibson
blushed
up
to
his
ears
as
he
heard
the
suggestion
of
course
you
be
there
with
them
mamma
no
my
dear
i
think
not
i
fancy
she
wishes
him
to
read
to
her
or
something
of
that
sort
then
gibson
without
speaking
a
word
but
still
blushing
up
to
his
ears
was
taken
to
arabella
room
and
camilla
flouncing
into
the
banged
the
door
behind
her
she
had
hitherto
fought
her
battle
with
considerable
skill
and
with
great
courage
but
her
very
success
had
made
her
imprudent
she
had
become
so
imperious
in
the
great
position
which
she
had
reached
that
she
could
not
control
her
temper
or
wait
till
her
power
was
confirmed
the
banging
of
that
door
was
heard
through
the
whole
house
and
every
one
knew
why
it
was
banged
she
threw
herself
on
to
a
sofa
and
then
instantly
rising
again
paced
the
room
with
quick
step
could
it
be
possible
that
there
was
treachery
was
it
on
the
cards
that
that
weak
poor
creature
bella
was
intriguing
once
again
to
defraud
her
of
her
husband
there
were
different
things
that
she
now
remembered
arabella
in
that
moment
of
bliss
in
which
she
had
conceived
herself
to
be
engaged
to
gibson
had
discarded
her
chignon
then
she
had
resumed
it
in
all
its
monstrous
proportions
since
that
it
had
been
lessened
by
degrees
and
brought
down
through
various
interesting
but
abnormal
shapes
to
a
size
which
would
hardly
have
drawn
forth
any
anathema
from
miss
stanbury
and
now
on
this
very
morning
arabella
had
put
on
a
clean
nightcap
with
muslin
frills
it
is
perhaps
not
unnatural
that
a
sick
lady
preparing
to
receive
a
clergyman
in
her
bedroom
should
put
on
a
clean
nightcap
but
to
suspicious
eyes
small
causes
suffice
to
create
alarm
and
if
there
were
any
such
hideous
wickedness
in
the
wind
had
arabella
any
colleague
in
her
villainy
could
it
be
that
the
mother
was
plotting
against
her
daughter
happiness
and
respectability
camilla
was
well
aware
that
her
mamma
would
at
first
have
preferred
to
give
arabella
to
gibson
had
the
choice
in
the
matter
been
left
to
her
but
now
when
the
thing
had
been
settled
before
all
the
world
would
not
such
treatment
on
a
mother
part
be
equal
to
infanticide
and
then
as
to
gibson
himself
camilla
was
not
prone
to
think
little
of
her
own
charms
but
she
had
been
unable
not
to
perceive
that
her
lover
had
become
negligent
in
his
personal
attentions
to
her
an
accepted
lover
who
deserves
to
have
been
accepted
should
devote
every
hour
at
his
command
to
his
mistress
but
gibson
had
of
late
been
so
chary
of
his
presence
at
heavitree
that
camilla
could
not
but
have
known
that
he
took
no
delight
in
coming
thither
she
had
acknowledged
this
to
herself
but
she
had
consoled
herself
with
the
reflection
that
marriage
would
make
this
all
right
gibson
was
not
the
man
to
stray
from
his
wife
and
she
could
trust
herself
to
obtain
a
sufficient
hold
upon
her
husband
hereafter
partly
by
the
strength
of
her
tongue
partly
by
the
ascendency
of
her
spirit
and
partly
also
by
the
comforts
which
she
would
provide
for
him
she
had
not
doubted
but
that
it
would
be
all
well
when
they
should
be
married
but
how
if
even
now
there
should
be
no
marriage
for
her
camilla
french
had
never
heard
of
creusa
and
of
jason
but
as
she
paced
her
mother
that
morning
she
was
a
medea
in
spirit
if
any
plot
of
that
kind
should
be
in
the
wind
she
would
do
such
things
that
all
devonshire
should
hear
of
her
wrongs
and
of
her
revenge
in
the
meantime
gibson
was
sitting
by
arabella
bedside
while
french
was
trying
to
make
herself
busy
in
her
own
chamber
next
door
there
had
been
a
reading
of
some
chapter
of
the
bible
or
of
some
portion
of
a
chapter
and
gibson
as
he
read
and
arabella
as
she
listened
had
endeavoured
to
take
to
their
hearts
and
to
make
use
of
the
word
which
they
heard
the
poor
young
woman
when
she
begged
her
mother
to
send
to
her
the
man
who
was
so
dear
to
her
did
so
with
some
condition
that
it
would
be
good
for
her
to
hear
a
clergyman
read
to
her
but
now
the
chapter
had
been
read
and
the
book
was
back
in
gibson
pocket
and
he
was
sitting
with
his
hand
on
the
bed
she
is
so
very
arrogant
said
bella
and
so
domineering
to
this
gibson
made
no
reply
i
sure
i
have
endeavoured
to
bear
it
well
though
you
must
have
known
what
i
have
suffered
thomas
nobody
can
understand
it
so
well
as
you
do
i
wish
i
had
never
been
born
said
gibson
tragically
do
say
that
thomas
because
it
wicked
but
i
do
see
all
the
harm
i
have
done
and
yet
i
did
not
mean
it
you
must
try
and
do
the
best
you
can
now
i
am
not
saying
what
that
should
be
i
am
not
dictating
to
you
you
are
a
man
and
of
course
you
must
judge
for
yourself
but
i
will
say
this
you
should
do
anything
just
because
it
is
the
easiest
i
do
suppose
i
should
live
after
it
i
do
indeed
but
that
should
not
signify
to
you
i
do
suppose
that
any
man
was
ever
before
in
such
a
terrible
position
since
the
world
began
it
is
difficult
i
am
sure
of
that
thomas
and
i
have
meant
to
be
so
true
i
fancy
sometimes
that
some
mysterious
agency
interferes
with
the
affairs
of
a
man
and
drives
him
on
and
on
and
on
almost
till
he
does
know
where
it
drives
him
as
he
said
this
in
a
voice
that
was
quite
sepulchral
in
its
tone
he
felt
some
consolation
in
the
conviction
that
this
mysterious
agency
could
not
affect
a
man
without
embuing
him
with
a
certain
amount
of
grandeur
very
uncomfortable
indeed
in
its
nature
but
still
having
considerable
value
as
a
counterpoise
pride
must
bear
pain
but
pain
is
recompensed
by
pride
she
is
so
strong
thomas
that
she
can
put
up
with
anything
said
arabella
in
a
whisper
strong
yes
said
he
with
a
shudder
she
is
strong
enough
and
as
for
love
do
talk
about
it
said
he
getting
up
from
his
chair
talk
about
it
you
will
drive
me
frantic
you
know
what
my
feelings
are
thomas
you
have
always
known
them
there
has
been
no
change
since
i
was
the
young
thing
you
first
knew
me
as
she
spoke
she
just
touched
his
hand
with
hers
but
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
this
sitting
with
his
elbow
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
his
forehead
on
his
hand
in
reply
to
what
she
said
to
him
he
merely
shook
his
head
not
intending
to
imply
thereby
any
doubt
of
the
truth
of
her
assertion
you
have
now
to
make
up
your
mind
and
to
be
bold
thomas
continued
arabella
she
says
that
you
are
a
coward
but
i
know
that
you
are
no
coward
i
told
her
so
and
she
said
that
i
was
interfering
oh
that
she
should
be
able
to
tell
me
that
i
interfere
when
i
defend
you
i
must
go
said
gibson
jumping
up
from
his
chair
i
must
go
bella
i
can
not
stand
this
any
longer
it
is
too
much
for
me
i
will
pray
that
i
may
decide
aright
god
bless
you
then
he
kissed
her
brow
as
she
lay
in
bed
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
he
had
hoped
to
go
from
the
house
without
further
converse
with
any
of
its
inmates
for
his
mind
was
disturbed
and
he
longed
to
be
at
rest
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
escape
so
easily
camilla
met
him
at
the
door
and
accosted
him
with
a
smile
there
had
been
time
for
much
meditation
during
the
last
half
hour
and
camilla
had
meditated
how
do
you
find
her
thomas
she
asked
she
seems
weak
but
i
believe
she
is
better
i
have
been
reading
to
her
come
in
thomas
will
you
not
it
is
bad
for
us
to
stand
talking
on
the
stairs
dear
thomas
do
let
us
be
so
cold
to
each
other
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
kiss
her
thinking
as
he
did
so
of
the
mysterious
agency
which
afflicted
him
tell
me
that
you
love
me
thomas
she
said
of
course
i
love
you
the
question
is
not
a
pleasant
one
when
put
by
a
lady
to
a
gentleman
whose
affections
towards
her
are
not
strong
and
it
requires
a
very
good
actor
to
produce
an
efficient
answer
i
hope
you
do
thomas
it
would
be
sad
indeed
if
you
did
not
you
are
not
weary
of
your
camilla
are
you
for
a
moment
there
came
upon
him
an
idea
that
he
would
confess
that
he
was
weary
of
her
but
he
found
at
once
that
such
an
effort
was
beyond
his
powers
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
he
said
because
you
do
not
come
to
me
camilla
as
she
spoke
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
wept
and
now
you
have
been
five
minutes
with
me
and
nearly
an
hour
with
bella
she
wanted
me
to
read
to
her
said
gibson
and
he
hated
himself
thoroughly
as
he
said
it
and
now
you
want
to
get
away
as
fast
as
you
can
continued
camilla
because
of
the
morning
service
said
gibson
this
was
quite
true
and
yet
he
hated
himself
again
for
saying
it
as
camilla
knew
the
truth
of
the
last
plea
she
was
obliged
to
let
him
go
but
she
made
him
swear
before
he
went
that
he
loved
her
dearly
i
think
all
right
she
said
to
herself
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
i
think
he
dare
make
it
wrong
if
he
does
gibson
as
he
walked
into
exeter
endeavoured
to
justify
his
own
conduct
to
himself
there
was
no
moment
he
declared
to
himself
in
which
he
had
not
endeavoured
to
do
right
seeing
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
placed
among
these
two
young
women
both
of
whom
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
how
could
he
have
saved
himself
from
vacillation
and
by
what
untoward
chance
had
it
come
to
pass
that
he
had
now
learned
to
dislike
so
vigorously
almost
to
hate
the
one
with
whom
he
had
been
for
a
moment
sufficiently
infatuated
to
think
that
he
loved
but
with
all
his
arguments
he
did
not
succeed
in
justifying
to
himself
his
own
conduct
and
he
hated
himself
chapter
lxvi
of
a
quarter
of
lamb
miss
stanbury
looking
out
of
her
parlour
window
saw
gibson
hurrying
towards
the
cathedral
down
the
passage
which
leads
from
southernhay
into
the
close
he
just
come
from
heavitree
i
be
bound
said
miss
stanbury
to
martha
who
was
behind
her
like
enough
though
they
do
say
that
the
poor
fool
of
a
man
has
become
quite
sick
of
his
bargain
already
he
have
to
be
sicker
yet
said
martha
they
were
to
have
been
married
last
week
and
nobody
ever
knew
why
it
was
put
off
it
my
belief
he
never
marry
her
and
she
be
served
right
quite
right
he
must
marry
her
now
she
been
buying
things
all
over
exeter
as
though
there
was
no
end
of
their
money
they
have
more
than
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
said
miss
stanbury
i
do
see
why
i
might
have
gone
to
service
this
morning
martha
it
quite
warm
now
out
in
the
close
you
better
wait
till
the
east
winds
is
over
she
was
at
puddock
only
the
day
before
yesterday
buying
the
finest
they
had
and
that
was
good
enough
psha
said
miss
stanbury
as
though
gibson
had
things
of
that
kind
good
enough
for
her
said
martha
then
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
awhile
miss
stanbury
was
standing
at
one
window
and
martha
at
the
other
watching
the
people
as
they
passed
backwards
and
forwards
in
and
out
of
the
close
dorothy
had
now
been
away
at
nuncombe
putney
for
some
weeks
and
her
aunt
felt
her
loneliness
with
a
heavy
sense
of
weakness
never
had
she
entertained
a
companion
in
the
house
who
had
suited
her
as
well
as
her
niece
dorothy
dorothy
would
always
listen
to
her
would
always
talk
to
her
would
always
bear
with
her
since
dorothy
had
gone
various
letters
had
been
interchanged
between
them
though
there
had
been
anger
about
brooke
burgess
there
had
been
no
absolute
rupture
but
miss
stanbury
had
felt
that
she
could
not
write
and
beg
her
niece
to
come
back
to
her
she
had
not
sent
dorothy
away
dorothy
had
chosen
to
go
because
her
aunt
had
had
an
opinion
of
her
own
as
to
what
was
fitting
for
her
heir
and
as
miss
stanbury
would
not
give
up
her
opinion
she
could
not
ask
her
niece
to
return
to
her
such
had
been
her
resolution
sternly
expressed
to
herself
a
dozen
times
during
these
solitary
weeks
but
time
and
solitude
had
acted
upon
her
and
she
longed
for
the
girl
presence
in
the
house
martha
she
said
at
last
i
think
i
shall
get
you
to
go
over
to
nuncombe
putney
again
why
not
again
it
not
so
far
i
suppose
that
the
journey
will
hurt
you
i
do
think
it
hurt
me
only
what
good
will
i
do
if
you
go
rightly
to
work
you
may
do
good
miss
dorothy
was
a
fool
to
go
the
way
she
did
a
great
fool
she
stayed
longer
than
i
thought
she
would
i
not
asking
you
what
you
thought
i
tell
you
what
do
you
send
giles
to
winslow
and
tell
them
to
send
in
early
a
nice
of
lamb
or
it
would
hurt
you
if
you
went
and
chose
it
yourself
it
would
hurt
me
at
all
you
get
it
nice
not
too
small
because
meat
is
meat
at
the
price
things
are
now
and
how
they
ever
see
butcher
meat
at
all
is
more
than
i
can
understand
people
as
has
to
be
careful
makes
a
little
go
a
long
way
you
get
it
a
good
size
and
take
it
over
in
a
basket
it
wo
hurt
you
done
up
clean
in
a
napkin
it
wo
hurt
me
at
all
and
you
give
it
to
miss
dorothy
with
my
love
do
you
let
think
i
sent
it
to
my
and
is
that
to
be
all
how
do
you
mean
all
because
the
railway
and
the
carrier
would
take
it
quite
ready
and
there
would
be
a
matter
of
ten
or
twelve
shillings
saved
in
the
journey
whose
affair
is
that
not
mine
of
course
i
believe
you
are
afraid
of
the
trouble
martha
or
else
you
like
going
because
they
poor
it
ai
fair
of
you
to
say
so
that
it
ai
all
i
ask
is
is
that
to
be
all
when
i
the
lamb
am
i
just
to
come
away
straight
or
am
i
to
say
anything
it
will
look
so
odd
if
just
to
put
down
the
basket
and
come
away
without
a
word
martha
yes
you
a
fool
that
true
too
it
would
be
like
you
to
go
about
in
that
dummy
way
it
and
you
that
was
so
fond
of
miss
dorothy
i
was
fond
of
her
of
course
you
be
talking
to
her
and
why
not
and
if
she
should
say
anything
about
returning
yes
you
can
say
that
you
know
her
old
aunt
would
would
refuse
to
have
her
back
again
you
can
put
it
your
own
way
you
know
you
need
make
me
find
words
for
you
but
she
wo
wo
what
wo
say
anything
about
returning
yes
she
will
martha
if
you
talk
to
her
rightly
the
servant
did
reply
for
awhile
but
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
you
might
as
well
go
about
the
lamb
at
once
martha
so
i
will
when
i
got
it
out
all
clear
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
just
this
may
i
tell
miss
dolly
straight
out
that
you
want
her
to
come
back
and
that
i
been
sent
to
say
so
no
martha
then
how
am
i
to
do
it
do
it
out
of
your
own
head
just
as
it
comes
up
at
the
moment
out
of
my
own
head
yes
just
as
you
feel
you
know
just
as
i
feel
you
understand
what
i
mean
martha
i
do
my
best
and
i
ca
say
no
more
and
if
you
scolds
me
afterwards
why
of
course
i
must
put
up
with
it
but
i
wo
scold
you
martha
then
i
go
out
to
winslow
about
the
lamb
at
once
very
nice
and
not
too
small
martha
martha
went
out
and
ordered
the
lamb
and
packed
it
as
desired
quite
clean
in
a
napkin
and
fitted
it
into
the
basket
and
arranged
with
giles
hickbody
to
carry
it
down
for
her
early
in
the
morning
to
the
station
so
that
she
might
take
the
first
train
to
lessborough
it
was
understood
that
she
was
to
hire
a
fly
at
lessborough
to
take
her
to
nuncombe
putney
now
that
she
understood
the
importance
of
her
mission
and
was
aware
that
the
present
she
took
with
her
was
only
the
customary
accompaniment
of
an
ambassadress
entrusted
with
a
great
mission
martha
said
nothing
even
about
the
expense
the
train
started
for
lessborough
at
seven
and
as
she
was
descending
from
her
room
at
six
miss
stanbury
in
her
flannel
stepped
out
of
the
door
of
her
own
room
just
put
this
in
the
basket
said
she
handing
a
note
to
her
servant
i
thought
last
night
i
write
a
word
just
put
it
in
the
basket
and
say
nothing
about
it
the
note
which
she
sent
was
as
follows
the
close
april
my
dear
dorothy
as
martha
talks
of
going
over
to
pay
you
a
visit
thought
that
i
just
get
her
to
take
you
a
quarter
of
lamb
which
is
coming
in
now
very
nice
i
do
envy
her
going
to
see
you
my
dear
for
i
had
gotten
somehow
to
love
to
see
your
pretty
face
i
getting
almost
strong
again
but
sir
peter
who
was
here
this
afternoon
just
calling
as
a
friend
was
uncivil
enough
to
say
that
too
much
of
an
old
woman
to
go
out
in
the
east
wind
i
told
him
it
did
much
matter
for
the
sooner
old
women
made
way
for
young
ones
the
better
i
am
very
desolate
and
solitary
here
but
i
rather
think
that
women
who
do
get
married
are
intended
to
be
desolate
and
perhaps
it
is
better
for
them
if
they
bestow
their
time
and
thoughts
properly
as
i
hope
you
do
my
dear
a
woman
with
a
family
of
children
has
almost
too
many
of
the
cares
of
this
world
to
give
her
mind
as
she
ought
to
the
other
what
shall
we
say
then
of
those
who
have
no
such
cares
and
yet
do
not
walk
uprightly
dear
dorothy
be
not
such
a
one
for
myself
i
acknowledge
bitterly
the
extent
of
my
shortcomings
much
has
been
given
to
me
but
if
much
be
expected
how
shall
i
answer
the
demand
i
hope
i
need
not
tell
you
that
whenever
it
may
suit
you
to
pay
a
visit
to
exeter
your
room
will
be
ready
for
you
and
there
will
be
a
warm
welcome
machugh
always
asks
after
you
and
so
has
clifford
i
wo
tell
you
what
clifford
said
about
your
colour
because
it
would
make
you
vain
the
heavitree
affair
has
all
been
put
off
of
course
you
have
heard
that
dear
dear
dear
you
know
what
i
think
so
i
need
not
repeat
it
give
my
respects
to
your
mamma
and
priscilla
and
for
yourself
accept
the
affectionate
love
of
your
loving
old
aunt
jemima
stanbury
if
martha
should
say
anything
to
you
you
may
feel
sure
that
she
knows
my
mind
poor
old
soul
she
felt
an
almost
uncontrollable
longing
to
have
her
niece
back
again
and
yet
she
told
herself
that
she
was
bound
not
to
send
a
regular
invitation
or
to
suggest
an
unconditional
return
dorothy
had
herself
decided
to
take
her
departure
and
if
she
chose
to
remain
away
so
it
must
be
she
miss
stanbury
could
not
demean
herself
by
renewing
her
invitation
she
read
her
letter
before
she
added
to
it
the
postscript
and
felt
that
it
was
too
solemn
in
its
tone
to
suggest
to
dorothy
that
which
she
wished
to
suggest
she
had
been
thinking
much
of
her
own
past
life
when
she
wrote
those
words
about
the
state
of
an
unmarried
woman
and
was
vacillating
between
two
minds
whether
it
were
better
for
a
young
woman
to
look
forward
to
the
cares
and
affections
and
perhaps
hard
usage
of
a
married
life
or
to
devote
herself
to
the
easier
and
safer
course
of
an
old
maid
career
but
an
old
maid
is
nothing
if
she
be
not
kind
and
good
she
acknowledged
that
and
acknowledging
it
added
the
postscript
to
her
letter
what
though
there
was
a
certain
blow
to
her
pride
in
the
writing
of
it
she
did
tell
herself
that
in
thus
referring
her
niece
to
martha
for
an
expression
of
her
own
mind
after
that
conversation
which
she
and
martha
had
had
in
the
parlour
she
was
in
truth
eating
her
own
words
but
the
postscript
was
written
and
though
she
took
the
letter
up
with
her
to
her
own
room
in
order
that
she
might
alter
the
words
if
she
repented
of
them
in
the
night
the
letter
was
sent
as
it
was
written
postscript
and
all
she
spent
the
next
day
with
very
sober
thoughts
when
machugh
called
upon
her
and
told
her
that
there
were
rumours
afloat
in
exeter
that
the
marriage
between
camilla
french
and
gibson
would
certainly
be
broken
off
in
spite
of
all
purchases
that
had
been
made
she
merely
remarked
that
they
were
two
poor
feckless
things
who
did
know
their
own
minds
camilla
knows
hers
plain
enough
said
machugh
sharply
but
even
this
did
not
give
miss
stanbury
any
spirit
she
waited
and
waited
patiently
till
martha
should
return
thinking
of
the
sweet
pink
colour
which
used
to
come
and
go
in
dorothy
cheeks
which
she
had
been
wont
to
observe
so
frequently
not
knowing
that
she
had
observed
it
and
loved
it
chapter
lxvii
river
cottage
three
days
after
hugh
stanbury
visit
to
manchester
street
he
wrote
a
note
to
lady
rowley
telling
her
of
the
address
at
which
might
be
found
both
trevelyan
and
his
son
as
bozzle
had
acknowledged
facts
are
things
which
may
be
found
out
hugh
had
gone
to
work
somewhat
after
the
bozzlian
fashion
and
had
found
out
this
fact
he
lives
at
a
place
called
river
cottage
at
willesden
wrote
stanbury
if
you
turn
off
the
harrow
road
to
the
right
about
a
mile
beyond
the
cemetery
you
will
find
the
cottage
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
lane
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
harrow
road
i
believe
you
can
go
to
willesden
by
railway
but
you
had
better
take
a
cab
from
london
there
was
much
consultation
respecting
this
letter
between
lady
rowley
and
trevelyan
and
it
was
decided
that
it
should
not
be
shown
to
sir
marmaduke
to
see
her
child
was
at
the
present
moment
the
most
urgent
necessity
of
the
poor
mother
and
both
the
ladies
felt
that
sir
marmaduke
in
his
wrath
might
probably
impede
rather
than
assist
her
in
this
desire
if
told
where
he
might
find
trevelyan
he
would
probably
insist
on
starting
in
quest
of
his
himself
and
the
distance
between
the
mother
and
her
child
might
become
greater
in
consequence
instead
of
less
there
were
many
consultations
and
the
upshot
of
these
was
that
lady
rowley
and
her
daughter
determined
to
start
for
willesden
without
saying
anything
to
sir
marmaduke
of
the
purpose
they
had
in
hand
when
emily
expressed
her
conviction
that
if
trevelyan
should
be
away
from
home
they
would
probably
be
able
to
make
their
way
into
the
house
so
as
to
see
the
child
lady
rowley
with
some
hesitation
acknowledged
that
such
might
be
the
case
but
the
child
mother
said
nothing
to
her
own
mother
of
a
scheme
which
she
had
half
formed
of
so
clinging
to
her
boy
that
no
human
power
should
separate
them
they
started
in
a
cab
as
advised
by
stanbury
and
were
driven
to
a
point
on
the
road
from
which
a
lane
led
down
to
willesden
passing
by
river
cottage
they
asked
as
they
came
along
and
met
no
difficulty
in
finding
their
way
at
the
point
on
the
road
indicated
there
was
a
country
inn
for
and
here
lady
rowley
proposed
that
they
should
leave
their
cab
urging
that
it
might
be
best
to
call
at
the
cottage
in
the
quietest
manner
possible
but
trevelyan
with
her
scheme
in
her
head
for
the
recapture
of
their
child
begged
that
the
cab
might
go
on
and
thus
they
were
driven
up
to
the
door
river
cottage
was
not
a
prepossessing
abode
it
was
a
new
building
of
bricks
with
a
door
in
the
middle
and
one
window
on
each
side
over
the
door
was
a
stone
tablet
bearing
the
name
river
cottage
there
was
a
little
garden
between
the
road
and
the
house
across
which
there
was
a
straight
path
to
the
door
in
front
of
one
window
was
a
small
shrub
generally
called
a
and
in
front
of
the
other
was
a
variegated
laurel
there
were
two
small
morsels
of
green
turf
and
a
distant
view
round
the
corner
of
the
house
of
a
row
of
cabbage
stumps
if
trevelyan
were
living
there
he
had
certainly
come
down
in
the
world
since
the
days
in
which
he
had
occupied
the
house
in
curzon
street
the
two
ladies
got
out
of
the
cab
and
slowly
walked
across
the
little
garden
trevelyan
was
dressed
in
black
and
she
wore
a
thick
veil
she
had
altogether
been
unable
to
make
up
her
mind
as
to
what
should
be
her
conduct
to
her
husband
should
she
see
him
that
must
be
governed
by
circumstances
as
they
might
occur
her
visit
was
made
not
to
him
but
to
her
boy
the
door
was
opened
before
they
knocked
and
trevelyan
himself
was
standing
in
the
narrow
passage
lady
rowley
was
the
first
to
speak
louis
she
said
i
have
brought
your
wife
to
see
you
who
told
you
that
i
was
here
he
asked
still
standing
in
the
passage
of
course
a
mother
would
find
out
where
was
her
child
said
lady
rowley
you
should
not
have
come
here
without
notice
he
said
i
was
careful
to
let
you
know
the
conditions
on
which
you
should
come
you
do
not
mean
that
i
shall
not
see
my
child
said
the
mother
oh
louis
you
will
let
me
see
him
trevelyan
hesitated
a
moment
still
keeping
his
position
firmly
in
the
doorway
by
this
time
an
old
woman
decently
dressed
and
of
comfortable
appearance
had
taken
her
place
behind
him
and
behind
her
was
a
slip
of
a
girl
about
fifteen
years
of
age
this
was
the
owner
of
river
cottage
and
her
daughter
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
cottage
were
now
there
standing
in
the
passage
i
ought
not
to
let
you
see
him
said
trevelyan
you
have
intruded
upon
me
in
coming
here
i
had
not
wished
to
see
you
here
till
you
had
complied
with
the
order
i
had
given
you
what
a
meeting
between
a
husband
and
a
wife
who
had
not
seen
each
other
now
for
many
months
between
a
husband
and
a
wife
who
were
still
young
enough
not
to
have
outlived
the
first
impulses
of
their
early
love
he
still
stood
there
guarding
the
way
and
had
not
even
put
out
his
hand
to
greet
her
he
was
guarding
the
way
lest
she
should
without
his
permission
obtain
access
to
her
own
child
she
had
not
removed
her
veil
and
now
she
hardly
dared
to
step
over
the
threshold
of
her
husband
house
at
this
moment
she
perceived
that
the
woman
behind
was
pointing
to
the
room
on
the
left
as
the
cottage
was
entered
and
emily
at
once
understood
that
her
boy
was
there
then
at
that
moment
she
heard
her
son
voice
as
in
his
solitude
the
child
began
to
cry
i
must
go
in
she
said
i
will
go
in
and
rushing
on
she
tried
to
push
aside
her
husband
her
mother
aided
her
nor
did
trevelyan
attempt
to
stop
her
with
violence
and
in
a
moment
she
was
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
a
small
sofa
with
her
child
in
her
arms
i
had
not
intended
to
hinder
you
said
trevelyan
but
i
require
from
you
a
promise
that
you
will
not
attempt
to
remove
him
why
should
she
not
take
him
home
with
her
said
lady
rowley
because
i
will
not
have
it
so
replied
trevelyan
because
i
choose
that
it
should
be
understood
that
i
am
to
be
the
master
of
my
own
affairs
trevelyan
had
now
thrown
aside
her
bonnet
and
her
veil
and
was
covering
her
child
with
caresses
the
poor
little
fellow
whose
mind
had
been
utterly
dismayed
by
the
events
which
had
occurred
to
him
since
his
capture
though
he
returned
her
kisses
did
so
in
fear
and
trembling
and
he
was
still
sobbing
rubbing
his
eyes
with
his
knuckles
and
by
no
means
yielding
himself
with
his
whole
heart
to
his
mother
tenderness
as
she
would
have
had
him
do
louey
she
said
whispering
to
him
you
know
mamma
you
have
forgotten
mamma
he
half
murmured
some
little
infantine
word
through
his
sobs
and
then
put
his
cheek
up
to
be
pressed
against
his
mother
face
louey
will
never
never
forget
his
own
mamma
will
he
louey
the
poor
boy
had
no
assurances
to
give
and
could
only
raise
his
cheek
again
to
be
kissed
in
the
meantime
lady
rowley
and
trevelyan
were
standing
by
not
speaking
to
each
other
regarding
the
scene
in
silence
illustration
you
have
forgotten
mamma
she
lady
rowley
could
see
that
he
was
frightfully
altered
in
appearance
even
since
the
day
on
which
she
had
so
lately
met
him
in
the
city
his
cheeks
were
thin
and
haggard
and
his
eyes
were
deep
and
very
bright
and
he
moved
them
quickly
from
side
to
side
as
though
ever
suspecting
something
he
seemed
to
be
smaller
in
stature
withered
as
it
were
as
though
he
had
melted
away
and
though
he
stood
looking
upon
his
wife
and
child
he
was
not
for
a
moment
still
he
would
change
the
posture
of
his
hands
and
arms
moving
them
quickly
with
little
surreptitious
jerks
and
would
shuffle
his
feet
upon
the
floor
almost
without
altering
his
position
his
clothes
hung
about
him
and
his
linen
was
soiled
and
worn
lady
rowley
noticed
this
especially
as
he
had
been
a
man
peculiarly
given
to
neatness
of
apparel
he
was
the
first
to
speak
you
have
come
down
here
in
a
cab
said
he
yes
in
a
cab
from
london
said
lady
rowley
of
course
you
will
go
back
in
it
you
can
not
stay
here
there
is
no
accommodation
it
is
a
wretched
place
but
it
suits
the
boy
as
for
me
all
places
are
now
alike
louis
said
his
wife
springing
up
from
her
knees
coming
to
him
and
taking
his
right
hand
between
both
her
own
you
will
let
me
take
him
with
me
i
know
you
will
let
me
take
him
with
me
i
can
not
do
that
emily
it
would
be
wrong
wrong
to
restore
a
child
to
his
mother
oh
louis
think
of
it
what
must
my
life
be
without
him
or
you
do
talk
of
me
it
is
too
late
for
that
not
if
you
will
be
reasonable
louis
and
listen
to
me
oh
heavens
how
ill
you
are
as
she
said
this
she
drew
nearer
to
him
so
that
her
face
was
almost
close
to
his
louis
come
back
come
back
and
let
it
all
be
forgotten
it
shall
be
a
dream
a
horrid
dream
and
nobody
shall
speak
of
it
he
left
his
hand
within
hers
and
stood
looking
into
her
face
he
was
well
aware
that
his
life
since
he
had
left
her
had
been
one
long
hour
of
misery
there
had
been
to
him
no
alleviation
no
comfort
no
consolation
he
had
not
a
friend
left
to
him
even
his
satellite
the
policeman
was
becoming
weary
of
him
and
manifestly
suspicious
the
woman
with
whom
he
was
now
lodging
and
whose
resources
were
infinitely
benefited
by
his
payments
to
her
had
already
thrown
out
hints
that
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
as
he
looked
at
his
wife
he
knew
that
he
loved
her
everything
for
him
now
was
hot
and
dry
and
poor
and
bitter
how
sweet
would
it
be
again
to
sit
with
her
soft
hand
in
his
to
feel
her
cool
brow
against
his
own
to
have
the
comfort
of
her
care
and
to
hear
the
music
of
loving
words
the
companionship
of
his
wife
had
once
been
to
him
everything
in
the
world
but
now
for
many
months
past
he
had
known
no
companion
she
bade
him
come
to
her
and
look
upon
all
this
trouble
as
a
dream
not
to
be
mentioned
could
it
be
possible
that
it
should
be
so
and
that
they
might
yet
be
happy
together
perhaps
in
some
distant
country
where
the
story
of
all
their
misery
might
not
be
known
he
felt
all
this
truly
and
with
a
keen
accuracy
if
he
were
mad
he
was
not
all
mad
i
will
tell
you
of
nothing
that
is
past
said
she
hanging
to
him
and
coming
still
nearer
to
him
and
embracing
his
arm
could
she
have
condescended
to
ask
him
not
to
tell
her
of
the
past
had
it
occurred
to
her
so
to
word
her
request
she
might
perhaps
have
prevailed
but
who
can
say
how
long
the
tenderness
of
his
heart
would
have
saved
him
from
further
outbreak
and
whether
such
prevailing
on
her
part
would
have
been
of
permanent
service
as
it
was
her
words
wounded
him
in
that
spot
of
his
inner
self
which
was
most
sensitive
on
that
spot
from
whence
had
come
all
his
fury
a
black
cloud
came
upon
his
brow
and
he
made
an
effort
to
withdraw
himself
from
her
grasp
it
was
necessary
to
him
that
she
should
in
some
fashion
own
that
he
had
been
right
and
now
she
was
promising
him
that
she
would
not
tell
him
of
his
fault
he
could
not
thus
swallow
down
all
the
convictions
by
which
he
had
fortified
himself
to
bear
the
misfortunes
which
he
had
endured
had
he
not
quarrelled
with
every
friend
he
possessed
on
this
score
and
should
he
now
stultify
himself
in
all
those
quarrels
by
admitting
that
he
had
been
cruel
unjust
and
needlessly
jealous
and
did
not
truth
demand
of
him
that
he
should
cling
to
his
old
assurances
had
she
not
been
disobedient
and
rebellious
had
she
not
received
the
man
both
him
personally
and
his
letters
after
he
had
explained
to
her
that
his
honour
demanded
that
it
should
not
be
so
how
could
he
come
into
such
terms
as
those
now
proposed
to
him
simply
because
he
longed
to
enjoy
the
rich
sweetness
of
her
soft
hand
to
feel
the
fragrance
of
her
breath
and
to
quench
the
heat
of
his
forehead
in
the
cool
atmosphere
of
her
beauty
why
have
you
driven
me
to
this
by
your
intercourse
with
that
man
he
said
why
why
why
did
you
do
it
she
was
still
clinging
to
him
louis
she
said
i
am
your
wife
yes
you
are
my
wife
and
will
you
still
believe
such
evil
of
me
without
any
cause
there
has
been
cause
horrible
cause
you
must
repent
repent
repent
heaven
help
me
said
the
woman
falling
back
from
him
and
returning
to
the
boy
who
was
now
seated
in
lady
rowley
lap
mamma
do
you
speak
to
him
what
can
i
say
would
he
think
better
of
me
were
i
to
own
myself
to
have
been
guilty
when
there
has
been
no
guilt
no
slightest
fault
does
he
wish
me
to
purchase
my
child
by
saying
that
i
am
not
fit
to
be
his
mother
louis
said
lady
rowley
if
any
man
was
ever
wrong
mad
madly
mistaken
you
are
so
now
have
you
come
out
here
to
accuse
me
again
as
you
did
before
in
london
he
asked
is
that
the
way
in
which
you
and
she
intend
to
let
the
past
be
as
she
says
like
a
dream
she
tells
me
that
i
am
ill
it
is
true
i
am
ill
and
she
is
killing
me
killing
me
by
her
obstinacy
what
would
you
have
me
do
said
the
wife
again
rising
from
her
child
acknowledge
your
transgressions
and
say
that
you
will
amend
your
conduct
for
the
future
mamma
mamma
what
shall
i
say
to
him
who
can
speak
to
a
man
that
is
beside
himself
replied
lady
rowley
i
am
not
so
beside
myself
as
yet
lady
rowley
but
that
i
know
how
to
guard
my
own
honour
and
to
protect
my
own
child
i
have
told
you
emily
the
terms
on
which
you
can
come
back
to
me
you
had
better
now
return
to
your
mother
house
and
if
you
wish
again
to
have
a
house
of
your
own
and
your
husband
and
your
boy
you
know
by
what
means
you
may
acquire
them
for
another
week
i
shall
remain
here
after
that
i
shall
remove
far
from
hence
and
where
will
you
go
louis
as
yet
i
know
not
to
italy
i
think
or
perhaps
to
america
it
matters
little
where
for
me
and
will
louey
be
taken
with
you
certainly
he
will
go
with
me
to
strive
to
bring
him
up
so
that
he
may
be
a
happier
man
than
his
father
is
all
that
there
is
now
left
for
me
in
life
trevelyan
had
now
got
the
boy
in
her
arms
and
her
mother
was
seated
by
her
on
the
sofa
trevelyan
was
standing
away
from
them
but
so
near
the
door
that
no
sudden
motion
on
their
part
would
enable
them
to
escape
with
the
boy
without
his
interposition
it
now
again
occurred
to
the
mother
to
carry
off
her
prize
in
opposition
to
her
husband
but
she
had
no
scheme
to
that
effect
laid
with
her
mother
and
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
idea
of
a
contest
with
him
in
which
personal
violence
would
be
necessary
the
woman
of
the
house
had
indeed
seemed
to
sympathise
with
her
but
she
could
not
dare
in
such
a
matter
to
trust
to
assistance
from
a
stranger
i
do
not
wish
to
be
uncourteous
said
trevelyan
but
if
you
have
no
assurance
to
give
me
you
had
better
leave
me
then
there
came
to
be
a
bargaining
about
time
and
the
poor
woman
begged
almost
on
her
knees
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
take
her
child
and
be
with
him
alone
for
a
few
minutes
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
not
seen
her
boy
till
she
had
had
him
to
herself
in
absolute
privacy
till
she
had
kissed
his
limbs
and
had
her
hand
upon
his
smooth
back
and
seen
that
he
was
white
and
clean
and
bright
as
he
had
ever
been
and
the
bargain
was
made
she
was
asked
to
pledge
her
word
that
she
would
not
take
him
out
of
the
house
and
she
pledged
her
word
feeling
that
there
was
no
strength
in
her
for
that
action
which
she
had
meditated
he
knowing
that
he
might
still
guard
the
passage
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
allowed
her
to
go
with
the
boy
to
his
bedroom
while
he
remained
below
with
lady
rowley
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
allowed
to
her
and
she
humbly
promised
that
she
would
return
when
that
time
was
expired
trevelyan
held
the
door
open
for
her
as
she
went
and
kept
it
open
during
her
absence
there
was
hardly
a
word
said
between
him
and
lady
rowley
but
he
paced
from
the
passage
into
the
room
and
from
the
room
into
the
passage
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
it
is
cruel
he
said
once
it
is
very
cruel
it
is
you
that
are
cruel
said
lady
rowley
of
course
of
course
that
is
natural
from
you
i
expect
that
from
you
to
this
she
made
no
answer
and
he
did
not
open
his
lips
again
after
a
while
trevelyan
called
to
her
mother
and
lady
rowley
was
allowed
to
go
the
quarter
of
an
hour
was
of
course
greatly
stretched
and
all
the
time
trevelyan
continued
to
pace
in
and
out
of
the
room
he
was
patient
for
he
did
not
summon
them
but
went
on
pacing
backwards
and
forwards
looking
now
and
again
to
see
that
the
cab
was
at
its
place
that
no
deceit
was
being
attempted
no
second
act
of
kidnapping
being
perpetrated
at
last
the
two
ladies
came
down
the
stairs
and
the
boy
was
with
them
and
the
woman
of
the
house
louis
said
the
wife
going
quickly
up
to
her
husband
i
will
do
anything
if
you
will
give
me
my
child
what
will
you
do
anything
say
what
you
want
he
is
all
the
world
to
me
and
i
can
not
live
if
he
be
taken
from
me
acknowledge
that
you
have
been
wrong
but
how
in
what
words
how
am
i
to
speak
it
say
that
you
have
sinned
and
that
you
will
sin
no
more
sinned
louis
as
the
woman
did
in
the
scripture
would
you
have
me
say
that
he
can
not
think
that
it
is
so
said
lady
rowley
but
trevelyan
had
not
understood
her
lady
rowley
i
should
have
fancied
that
my
thoughts
at
any
rate
were
my
own
but
this
is
useless
now
the
child
can
not
go
with
you
nor
can
you
remain
here
go
home
and
think
of
what
i
have
said
if
then
you
will
do
as
i
would
have
you
you
shall
return
with
many
embraces
with
promises
of
motherly
love
and
with
prayers
for
love
in
return
the
poor
woman
did
at
last
leave
the
house
and
return
to
the
cab
as
she
went
there
was
a
doubt
on
her
own
mind
whether
she
should
ask
to
kiss
her
husband
but
he
made
no
sign
and
she
at
last
passed
out
without
any
mark
of
tenderness
he
stood
by
the
cab
as
they
entered
it
and
closed
the
door
upon
them
and
then
went
slowly
back
to
his
room
my
poor
bairn
he
said
to
the
boy
my
poor
bairn
why
for
mamma
go
sobbed
the
child
mamma
goes
oh
heaven
and
earth
why
should
she
go
she
goes
because
her
spirit
is
obstinate
and
she
will
not
bend
she
is
and
will
not
submit
herself
but
louey
must
love
mamma
always
and
mamma
some
day
will
come
back
to
him
and
be
good
to
him
mamma
is
good
always
said
the
child
trevelyan
had
intended
on
this
very
afternoon
to
have
gone
up
to
town
to
transact
business
with
bozzle
for
he
still
believed
though
the
aspect
of
the
man
was
bitter
to
him
as
wormwood
that
bozzle
was
necessary
to
him
in
all
his
business
and
he
still
made
appointments
with
the
man
sometimes
at
stony
walk
in
the
borough
and
sometimes
at
the
tavern
in
poulter
court
even
though
bozzle
not
unfrequently
neglected
to
attend
the
summons
of
his
employer
and
he
would
go
to
his
and
draw
out
money
and
then
walk
about
the
crowded
lanes
of
the
city
and
afterwards
return
to
his
desolate
lodgings
at
willesden
thinking
that
he
had
been
transacting
business
and
that
this
business
was
exacted
from
him
by
the
unfortunate
position
of
his
affairs
but
now
he
gave
up
his
journey
his
retreat
had
been
discovered
and
there
came
upon
him
at
once
a
fear
that
if
he
left
the
house
his
child
would
be
taken
his
landlady
told
him
on
this
very
day
that
the
boy
ought
to
be
sent
to
his
mother
and
had
made
him
understand
that
it
would
not
suit
her
to
find
a
home
any
longer
for
one
who
was
so
singular
in
his
proceedings
he
believed
that
his
child
would
be
given
up
at
once
if
he
were
not
there
to
guard
it
he
stayed
at
home
therefore
turning
in
his
mind
many
schemes
he
had
told
his
wife
that
he
should
go
either
to
italy
or
to
america
at
once
but
in
doing
so
he
had
had
no
formed
plan
in
his
head
he
had
simply
imagined
at
the
moment
that
such
a
threat
would
bring
her
to
submission
but
now
it
became
a
question
whether
he
would
do
better
than
go
to
america
he
suggested
to
himself
that
he
should
go
to
canada
and
fix
himself
with
his
boy
on
some
remote
farm
far
away
from
any
city
and
would
then
invite
his
wife
to
join
him
if
she
would
she
was
too
obstinate
as
he
told
himself
ever
to
yield
unless
she
should
be
absolutely
softened
and
brought
down
to
the
ground
by
the
loss
of
her
child
what
would
do
this
so
effectually
as
the
interposition
of
the
broad
ocean
between
him
and
her
he
sat
thinking
of
this
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
louey
was
left
to
the
charge
of
the
mistress
of
river
cottage
do
you
think
he
believes
it
mamma
trevelyan
said
to
her
mother
when
they
had
already
made
nearly
half
their
journey
home
in
the
cab
there
had
been
nothing
spoken
hitherto
between
them
except
some
words
of
affection
intended
for
consolation
to
the
young
mother
in
her
great
affliction
he
does
not
know
what
he
believes
dearest
you
heard
what
he
said
i
was
to
own
that
i
had
sinned
sinned
yes
because
you
will
not
obey
him
like
a
slave
that
is
sin
to
him
but
i
asked
him
mamma
did
you
not
hear
me
i
could
not
say
the
word
plainer
but
i
asked
him
whether
he
meant
that
sin
he
must
have
known
and
he
would
not
answer
me
and
he
spoke
of
my
transgression
mamma
if
he
believed
that
he
would
not
let
me
come
back
at
all
he
did
not
believe
it
emily
could
he
possibly
then
so
accuse
me
the
mother
of
his
child
if
his
heart
be
utterly
hard
and
false
towards
me
if
it
is
possible
that
he
should
be
cruel
to
me
with
such
cruelty
as
that
still
he
must
love
his
boy
why
did
he
not
answer
me
and
say
that
he
did
not
think
it
simply
because
his
reason
has
left
him
but
if
he
be
mad
mamma
ought
we
to
leave
him
like
that
and
then
did
you
see
his
eyes
and
his
face
and
his
hands
did
you
observe
how
thin
he
is
and
his
back
how
bent
and
his
clothes
how
they
were
torn
and
soiled
it
can
not
be
right
that
he
should
be
left
like
that
we
will
tell
papa
when
we
get
home
said
lady
rowley
who
was
herself
beginning
to
be
somewhat
frightened
by
what
she
had
seen
it
is
all
very
well
to
declare
that
a
friend
is
mad
when
one
simply
desires
to
justify
one
self
in
opposition
to
that
friend
but
the
matter
becomes
much
more
serious
when
evidence
of
the
insanity
becomes
true
and
circumstantial
i
certainly
think
that
a
physician
should
see
him
continued
lady
rowley
on
their
return
home
sir
marmaduke
was
told
of
what
had
occurred
and
there
was
a
long
family
discussion
in
which
it
was
decided
that
lady
milborough
should
be
consulted
as
being
the
oldest
friend
of
louis
trevelyan
himself
with
whom
they
were
acquainted
trevelyan
had
relatives
of
his
own
name
living
in
cornwall
but
trevelyan
herself
had
never
even
met
one
of
that
branch
of
the
family
sir
marmaduke
however
resolved
that
he
himself
would
go
out
and
see
his
he
too
had
called
trevelyan
mad
but
he
did
not
believe
that
the
madness
was
of
such
a
nature
as
to
interfere
with
his
own
duties
in
punishing
the
man
who
had
ill
used
his
daughter
he
would
at
any
rate
see
trevelyan
himself
but
of
this
he
said
nothing
either
to
his
wife
or
to
his
child
chapter
lxviii
major
magruder
committee
illustration
sir
marmaduke
could
not
go
out
to
willesden
on
the
morning
after
lady
rowley
return
from
river
cottage
because
on
that
day
he
was
summoned
to
attend
at
twelve
before
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
to
give
his
evidence
and
the
fruit
of
his
experience
as
to
the
government
of
british
colonies
generally
and
as
he
went
down
to
the
house
in
a
cab
from
manchester
street
he
thoroughly
wished
that
his
friend
colonel
osborne
had
not
been
so
efficacious
in
bringing
him
home
the
task
before
him
was
one
which
he
thoroughly
disliked
and
of
which
he
was
afraid
he
dreaded
the
inquisitors
before
whom
he
was
to
appear
and
felt
that
though
he
was
called
there
to
speak
as
a
master
of
his
art
of
governing
he
would
in
truth
be
examined
as
a
servant
and
probably
as
a
servant
who
did
not
know
his
business
had
his
sojourn
at
home
been
in
other
respects
happy
he
might
have
been
able
to
balance
the
advantage
against
the
inquiry
but
there
was
no
such
balancing
for
him
now
and
moreover
the
expense
of
his
own
house
in
manchester
street
was
so
large
that
this
journey
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
would
be
of
but
little
service
to
him
so
he
went
down
to
the
house
in
an
unhappy
mood
and
when
he
shook
hands
in
one
of
the
passages
with
his
friend
osborne
who
was
on
the
committee
there
was
very
little
cordiality
in
his
manner
this
is
the
most
ungrateful
thing
i
ever
knew
said
the
colonel
to
himself
i
have
almost
disgraced
myself
by
having
this
fellow
brought
home
and
now
he
quarrels
with
me
because
that
idiot
his
has
quarrelled
with
his
wife
and
colonel
osborne
really
did
feel
that
he
was
a
martyr
to
the
ingratitude
of
his
friend
the
committee
had
been
convoked
by
the
house
in
compliance
with
the
eager
desires
of
a
certain
ancient
pundit
of
the
constitution
who
had
been
for
many
years
a
member
and
who
had
been
known
as
a
stern
critic
of
our
colonial
modes
of
government
to
him
it
certainly
seemed
that
everything
that
was
was
bad
as
regarded
our
national
dependencies
but
this
is
so
usually
the
state
of
mind
of
all
parliamentary
critics
it
is
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
the
members
who
take
up
the
army
or
the
navy
guns
india
our
relations
with
spain
or
workhouse
management
should
find
everything
to
be
bad
rotten
and
dishonest
that
the
wrath
of
the
member
for
killicrankie
against
colonial
peculation
and
idleness
was
not
thought
much
of
in
the
open
house
he
had
been
at
the
work
for
years
and
the
colonial
office
were
so
used
to
it
that
they
rather
liked
him
he
had
made
himself
free
of
the
office
and
the
clerks
were
always
glad
to
see
him
it
was
understood
that
he
said
bitter
things
in
the
house
that
was
major
magruder
line
of
business
but
he
could
be
quite
pleasant
when
he
was
asking
questions
of
a
private
secretary
or
telling
the
news
of
the
day
to
a
senior
clerk
as
he
was
now
between
seventy
and
eighty
and
had
been
at
the
work
for
at
least
twenty
years
most
of
those
concerned
had
allowed
themselves
to
think
that
he
would
ride
his
hobby
harmlessly
to
the
day
of
his
parliamentary
death
but
the
drop
from
a
house
corner
will
hollow
a
stone
by
its
constancy
and
major
magruder
at
last
persuaded
the
house
to
grant
him
a
committee
of
inquiry
then
there
came
to
be
serious
faces
at
the
colonial
office
and
all
the
little
pleasantries
of
a
friendly
opposition
were
at
an
end
it
was
felt
that
the
battle
must
now
become
a
real
fight
and
secretary
and
girded
up
their
loins
major
magruder
was
chairman
of
his
own
committee
and
being
a
man
of
a
laborious
turn
of
mind
much
given
to
very
patient
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
house
and
imbued
with
a
strong
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
parliamentary
questionings
to
carry
a
point
if
not
to
elicit
a
fact
had
a
happy
time
of
it
during
this
session
he
was
a
man
who
always
attended
the
house
from
to
the
time
of
its
breaking
up
and
who
never
missed
a
division
the
slight
additional
task
of
sitting
four
hours
in
a
three
days
a
week
was
only
a
delight
the
more
especially
as
during
those
four
hours
he
could
occupy
the
post
of
chairman
those
who
knew
major
magruder
well
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
committee
would
sit
for
many
weeks
and
that
the
whole
theory
of
colonial
government
or
rather
of
imperial
control
supervising
such
government
would
be
tested
to
the
very
utmost
men
who
had
heard
the
old
major
maunder
on
for
years
past
on
his
pet
subject
hardly
knew
how
much
vitality
would
be
found
in
him
when
his
maundering
had
succeeded
in
giving
him
a
committee
a
governor
from
one
of
the
greater
colonies
had
already
been
under
question
for
nearly
a
week
and
was
generally
thought
to
have
come
out
of
the
fire
unscathed
by
the
flames
of
the
major
criticism
this
governor
had
been
a
picked
man
and
he
had
made
it
appear
that
the
control
of
downing
street
was
never
more
harsh
and
seldom
less
refreshing
and
beautifying
than
a
spring
shower
in
april
no
other
lands
under
the
sun
were
so
blest
in
the
way
of
government
as
were
the
colonies
with
which
he
had
been
acquainted
and
as
a
natural
consequence
their
devotion
and
loyalty
to
the
mother
country
were
quite
a
passion
with
them
now
the
major
had
been
long
of
a
mind
that
one
or
two
colonies
had
better
simply
be
given
up
to
other
nations
which
were
more
fully
able
to
look
after
them
than
was
england
and
that
three
or
four
more
should
be
allowed
to
go
clear
costing
england
nothing
and
owing
england
nothing
but
the
governor
who
had
now
been
before
the
committee
had
rather
staggered
the
major
and
things
altogether
were
supposed
to
be
looking
up
for
the
colonial
office
and
now
had
come
the
day
of
sir
marmaduke
martyrdom
he
was
first
requested
with
most
urbane
politeness
to
explain
the
exact
nature
of
the
government
which
he
exercised
in
the
mandarins
now
it
certainly
was
the
case
that
the
manner
in
which
the
legislative
and
executive
authorities
were
intermingled
in
the
affairs
of
these
islands
did
create
a
complication
which
it
was
difficult
for
any
man
to
understand
and
very
difficult
indeed
for
any
man
to
explain
to
others
there
was
a
court
of
chancery
so
called
which
sir
marmaduke
described
as
a
little
parliament
when
he
was
asked
whether
the
court
exercised
legislative
or
executive
functions
he
said
at
first
that
it
exercised
both
and
then
that
it
exercised
neither
he
knew
that
it
consisted
of
nine
men
of
whom
five
were
appointed
by
the
colony
and
four
by
the
crown
yet
he
declared
that
the
crown
had
the
control
of
the
court
which
in
fact
was
true
enough
no
doubt
as
the
five
open
members
were
not
perhaps
all
of
them
immaculate
patriots
but
on
this
matter
poor
sir
marmaduke
was
very
obscure
when
asked
who
exercised
the
patronage
of
the
crown
in
nominating
the
four
members
he
declared
that
the
four
members
exercised
it
themselves
did
he
appoint
them
no
he
never
appointed
anybody
himself
he
consulted
the
court
of
chancery
for
everything
at
last
it
came
out
that
the
chief
justice
of
the
islands
and
three
other
officers
always
sat
in
the
court
but
whether
it
was
required
by
the
constitution
of
the
islands
that
this
should
be
so
sir
marmaduke
did
not
know
it
had
worked
well
that
was
to
say
everybody
had
complained
of
it
but
he
sir
marmaduke
would
not
recommend
any
change
what
he
thought
best
was
that
the
colonial
secretary
should
send
out
his
orders
and
that
the
people
in
the
colonies
should
mind
their
business
and
grow
coffee
when
asked
what
would
be
the
effect
upon
the
islands
under
his
scheme
of
government
if
an
incoming
colonial
secretary
should
change
the
policy
of
his
predecessor
he
said
that
he
did
think
it
would
much
matter
if
the
people
did
not
know
anything
about
it
in
this
way
the
major
had
a
field
day
and
poor
sir
marmaduke
was
much
discomfited
there
was
present
on
the
committee
a
young
parliamentary
who
with
much
attention
had
studied
the
subject
of
the
court
of
chancery
in
the
mandarins
and
who
had
acknowledged
to
his
superiors
in
the
office
that
it
certainly
was
of
all
legislative
assemblies
the
most
awkward
and
complicated
he
did
what
he
could
by
questions
judiciously
put
to
pull
sir
marmaduke
through
his
difficulties
but
the
unfortunate
governor
had
more
than
once
lost
his
temper
in
answering
the
chairman
and
in
his
heavy
confusion
was
past
the
power
of
any
let
him
be
ever
so
clever
to
pull
him
through
colonel
osborne
sat
by
the
while
and
asked
no
questions
he
had
been
put
on
the
committee
as
a
respectable
dummy
but
there
was
not
a
member
sitting
there
who
did
not
know
that
sir
marmaduke
had
been
brought
home
as
his
friend
and
some
of
them
no
doubt
had
whispered
that
this
bringing
home
of
sir
marmaduke
was
part
of
the
payment
made
by
the
colonel
for
the
smiles
of
the
governor
daughter
but
no
one
alluded
openly
to
the
inefficiency
of
the
evidence
given
no
one
asked
why
a
governor
so
incompetent
had
been
sent
to
them
no
one
suggested
that
a
job
had
been
done
there
are
certain
things
of
which
opposition
members
of
parliament
complain
loudly
and
there
are
certain
other
things
as
to
which
they
are
silent
the
line
between
these
things
is
well
known
and
should
an
a
an
underbred
or
an
ignorant
member
not
understand
this
line
and
transgress
it
by
asking
questions
which
should
not
be
asked
he
is
soon
put
down
from
the
treasury
bench
to
the
great
delight
of
the
whole
house
sir
marmaduke
after
having
been
questioned
for
an
entire
afternoon
left
the
house
with
extreme
disgust
he
was
so
convinced
of
his
own
failure
that
he
felt
that
his
career
as
a
colonial
governor
must
be
over
surely
they
would
never
let
him
go
back
to
his
islands
after
such
an
exposition
as
he
had
made
of
his
own
ignorance
he
hurried
off
into
a
cab
and
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
of
men
but
the
members
of
the
committee
thought
little
or
nothing
about
it
the
major
and
those
who
sided
with
him
had
been
anxious
to
entrap
their
witness
into
contradictions
and
absurdities
for
the
furtherance
of
their
own
object
and
for
the
furtherance
of
theirs
the
from
the
office
and
the
supporters
of
government
had
endeavoured
to
defend
their
man
but
when
the
affair
was
over
if
no
special
admiration
had
been
elicited
for
sir
marmaduke
neither
was
there
expressed
any
special
reprobation
the
major
carried
on
his
committee
over
six
weeks
and
succeeded
in
having
his
printed
but
as
a
matter
of
course
nothing
further
came
of
it
and
the
court
of
chancery
in
the
mandarin
islands
still
continues
to
hold
its
own
and
to
do
its
work
in
spite
of
the
absurdities
displayed
in
its
construction
major
magruder
has
had
his
day
of
success
and
now
feels
that
othello
occupation
is
gone
he
goes
no
more
to
the
colonial
office
lives
among
his
friends
on
the
memories
of
his
committee
not
always
to
their
gratification
and
is
beginning
to
think
that
as
his
work
is
done
he
may
as
well
resign
killicrankie
to
some
younger
politician
poor
sir
marmaduke
remembered
his
defeat
with
soreness
long
after
it
had
been
forgotten
by
all
others
who
had
been
present
and
was
astonished
when
he
found
that
the
journals
of
the
day
though
they
did
in
some
curt
fashion
report
the
proceedings
of
the
committee
never
uttered
a
word
of
censure
against
him
as
they
had
not
before
uttered
a
word
of
praise
for
that
pearl
of
a
governor
who
had
been
examined
before
him
on
the
following
morning
he
went
to
the
colonial
office
by
appointment
and
then
he
saw
the
young
irish
whom
he
had
so
much
dreaded
nothing
could
be
more
civil
than
was
the
young
irish
who
told
him
that
he
had
better
of
course
stay
in
town
till
the
committee
was
over
though
it
was
not
probable
that
he
would
be
wanted
again
when
the
committee
had
done
its
work
he
would
be
allowed
to
remain
six
weeks
on
service
to
prepare
for
his
journey
back
if
he
wanted
more
time
after
that
he
could
ask
for
leave
of
absence
so
sir
marmaduke
left
the
colonial
office
with
a
great
weight
off
his
mind
and
blessed
that
young
irish
secretary
as
he
went
chapter
lxix
sir
marmaduke
at
willesden
on
the
next
day
sir
marmaduke
purposed
going
to
willesden
he
was
in
great
doubt
whether
or
no
he
would
first
consult
that
very
eminent
man
trite
turbury
as
to
the
possibility
and
if
possible
as
to
the
expediency
of
placing
trevelyan
under
some
control
but
sir
marmaduke
though
he
would
repeatedly
declare
that
his
was
mad
did
not
really
believe
in
this
madness
he
did
not
that
is
believe
that
trevelyan
was
so
mad
as
to
be
fairly
exempt
from
the
penalties
of
responsibility
and
he
was
therefore
desirous
of
speaking
his
own
mind
out
fully
to
the
man
and
as
it
were
of
having
his
own
personal
revenge
before
he
might
be
deterred
by
the
interposition
of
medical
advice
he
resolved
therefore
that
he
would
not
see
sir
trite
turbury
at
any
rate
till
he
had
come
back
from
willesden
he
also
went
down
in
a
cab
but
he
left
the
cab
at
the
at
the
corner
of
the
road
and
walked
to
the
cottage
when
he
asked
whether
trevelyan
was
at
home
the
woman
of
the
house
hesitated
and
then
said
that
her
lodger
was
out
i
particularly
wish
to
see
him
said
sir
marmaduke
feeling
that
the
woman
was
lying
to
him
but
he
ai
to
be
seen
sir
said
the
woman
i
know
he
is
at
home
said
sir
marmaduke
but
the
argument
was
soon
cut
short
by
the
appearance
of
trevelyan
behind
the
shoulder
i
am
here
sir
marmaduke
rowley
said
trevelyan
if
you
wish
to
see
me
you
may
come
in
i
will
not
say
that
you
are
welcome
but
you
can
come
in
then
the
woman
retired
and
sir
marmaduke
followed
trevelyan
into
the
room
in
which
lady
rowley
and
emily
had
been
received
but
the
child
was
not
now
in
the
chamber
what
are
these
charges
that
i
hear
against
my
daughter
said
sir
marmaduke
rushing
at
once
into
the
midst
of
his
indignation
i
do
not
know
what
charges
you
have
heard
you
have
put
her
away
in
strict
accuracy
that
is
not
correct
sir
marmaduke
but
she
is
put
away
she
is
in
my
house
now
because
you
have
no
house
of
your
own
for
her
is
not
that
so
and
when
i
came
home
she
was
staying
with
her
uncle
because
you
had
put
her
away
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
her
being
sent
down
into
devonshire
what
has
she
done
i
am
her
father
and
i
expect
to
have
an
answer
you
shall
have
an
answer
certainly
and
a
true
one
i
will
have
no
no
humbug
no
jesuitry
have
you
come
here
to
insult
me
sir
marmaduke
because
if
so
there
shall
be
an
end
to
this
interview
at
once
there
shall
not
be
an
end
by
g
no
not
till
i
have
heard
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
do
you
know
what
people
are
saying
of
you
that
you
are
mad
and
that
you
must
be
locked
up
and
your
child
taken
away
from
you
and
your
property
who
are
the
people
that
say
so
yourself
and
perhaps
lady
rowley
does
my
wife
say
so
does
she
think
that
i
am
mad
she
did
not
think
so
on
thursday
when
she
prayed
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
come
back
and
live
with
me
and
you
would
not
let
her
come
pardon
me
said
trevelyan
i
would
wish
that
she
should
come
but
it
must
be
on
certain
conditions
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
she
was
turned
out
of
your
house
she
was
not
turned
out
what
has
she
done
that
she
should
be
punished
urged
sir
marmaduke
who
was
unable
to
arrange
his
questions
with
the
happiness
which
had
distinguished
major
magruder
i
insist
upon
knowing
what
it
is
that
you
lay
to
her
charge
i
am
her
father
and
i
have
a
right
to
know
she
has
been
barbarously
shamefully
and
by
g
i
will
know
you
have
come
here
to
bully
me
sir
marmaduke
rowley
i
have
come
here
sir
to
do
the
duty
of
a
parent
to
his
child
to
protect
my
poor
girl
against
the
cruelty
of
a
husband
who
in
an
unfortunate
hour
was
allowed
to
take
her
from
her
home
i
will
know
the
reason
why
my
daughter
has
been
treated
as
though
as
though
as
though
listen
to
me
for
a
minute
said
trevelyan
i
am
listening
i
will
tell
you
nothing
i
will
answer
you
not
a
word
you
will
not
answer
me
not
when
you
come
to
me
in
this
fashion
my
wife
is
my
wife
and
my
claim
to
her
is
nearer
and
closer
than
is
yours
who
are
her
father
she
is
the
mother
of
my
child
and
the
only
being
in
the
world
except
that
child
whom
i
love
do
you
think
that
with
such
motives
on
my
part
for
tenderness
towards
her
for
loving
care
for
the
most
anxious
solicitude
that
i
can
be
made
more
anxious
more
tender
more
loving
by
coarse
epithets
from
you
i
am
the
most
miserable
being
under
the
sun
because
our
happiness
has
been
interrupted
and
is
it
likely
that
such
misery
should
be
cured
by
violent
words
and
gestures
if
your
heart
is
wrung
for
her
so
is
mine
if
she
be
much
to
you
she
is
more
to
me
she
came
here
the
other
day
almost
as
a
stranger
and
i
thought
that
my
heart
would
have
burst
beneath
its
weight
of
woe
what
can
you
do
that
can
add
an
ounce
to
the
burden
that
i
bear
you
may
as
well
leave
me
or
at
least
be
quiet
sir
marmaduke
had
stood
and
listened
to
him
and
he
too
was
so
struck
by
the
altered
appearance
of
the
man
that
the
violence
of
his
indignation
was
lessened
by
the
pity
which
he
could
not
suppress
when
trevelyan
spoke
of
his
wretchedness
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
him
he
was
as
wretched
a
being
to
look
at
as
it
might
have
been
possible
to
find
his
contracted
cheeks
and
lips
always
open
and
eyes
glowing
in
their
sunken
caverns
told
a
tale
which
even
sir
marmaduke
who
was
not
of
nature
quick
in
deciphering
such
stories
could
not
fail
to
read
and
then
the
twitching
motion
of
the
man
hands
and
the
restless
shuffling
of
his
feet
produced
a
nervous
feeling
that
if
some
remedy
were
not
applied
quickly
some
alleviation
given
to
the
misery
of
the
suffering
wretch
human
power
would
be
strained
too
far
and
the
man
would
break
to
pieces
or
else
the
mind
of
the
man
sir
marmaduke
during
his
journey
in
the
cab
had
resolved
that
old
as
he
was
he
would
take
this
sinner
by
the
throat
this
brute
who
had
striven
to
stain
his
name
and
would
make
him
there
and
then
acknowledge
his
own
brutality
but
it
was
now
very
manifest
to
sir
marmaduke
that
there
could
be
no
taking
by
the
throat
in
this
case
he
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
touch
the
poor
weak
passionate
creature
before
him
indeed
even
the
fury
of
his
words
was
stayed
and
after
that
last
appeal
he
stormed
no
more
but
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
it
he
said
who
can
tell
who
can
say
she
can
tell
she
can
put
an
end
to
it
all
she
has
but
to
say
a
word
and
i
will
devote
my
life
to
her
but
that
word
must
be
spoken
as
he
said
this
he
dashed
his
hand
upon
the
table
and
looked
up
with
an
air
that
would
have
been
comic
with
its
assumed
magnificence
had
it
not
been
for
the
true
tragedy
of
the
occasion
you
had
better
at
any
rate
let
her
have
her
child
for
the
present
no
my
boy
shall
go
with
me
she
may
go
too
if
she
pleases
but
my
boy
shall
certainly
go
with
me
if
i
had
put
her
from
me
as
you
said
just
now
it
might
have
been
otherwise
but
she
shall
be
as
welcome
to
me
as
flowers
in
may
as
flowers
in
may
she
shall
be
as
welcome
to
me
as
the
music
of
heaven
sir
marmaduke
felt
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
urge
he
had
altogether
abandoned
that
idea
of
having
his
revenge
at
the
cost
of
the
man
throat
and
was
quite
convinced
that
reason
could
have
no
power
with
him
he
was
already
thinking
that
he
would
go
away
straight
to
his
lawyer
so
that
some
step
might
be
taken
at
once
to
stop
if
possible
the
taking
away
of
the
boy
to
america
when
the
lock
of
the
door
was
gently
turned
and
the
landlady
entered
the
room
you
will
excuse
me
sir
said
the
woman
but
if
you
be
anything
to
this
gentleman
fuller
leave
the
room
said
trevelyan
i
and
the
gentleman
are
engaged
i
see
you
be
engaged
and
i
do
beg
pardon
i
ai
one
as
would
intrude
wilful
and
as
for
listening
or
the
likes
of
that
i
scorn
it
but
if
this
gentleman
be
anything
to
you
trevelyan
i
am
his
wife
father
said
sir
marmaduke
like
enough
i
was
thinking
perhaps
so
his
lady
was
down
here
on
thursday
as
sweet
a
lady
as
any
gentleman
need
wish
to
stretch
by
his
side
fuller
said
trevelyan
marching
up
towards
her
i
will
not
have
this
and
i
desire
that
you
will
retire
from
my
room
but
fuller
escaped
round
the
table
and
would
not
be
banished
she
got
round
the
table
and
came
closely
opposite
to
sir
marmaduke
i
do
want
to
say
nothing
out
of
my
place
sir
said
she
but
something
ought
to
be
done
he
ai
fit
to
be
left
to
hisself
not
alone
not
as
he
is
at
present
he
ai
indeed
and
i
would
be
doing
my
duty
if
i
did
say
so
he
has
them
sweats
at
night
as
be
enough
to
kill
any
man
and
he
eats
nothing
and
he
do
do
nothing
and
as
for
that
poor
little
boy
as
is
now
in
my
own
bed
upstairs
if
it
was
that
i
and
my
bessy
is
fond
of
children
i
do
know
what
would
become
of
that
boy
trevelyan
finding
it
impossible
to
get
rid
of
her
had
stood
quietly
while
he
listened
to
her
she
has
been
good
to
my
child
he
said
i
acknowledge
it
as
for
myself
i
have
not
been
well
it
is
true
but
i
am
told
that
travel
will
set
me
on
my
feet
again
change
of
air
will
do
it
not
long
since
he
had
been
urging
the
wretchedness
of
his
own
bodily
health
as
a
reason
why
his
wife
should
yield
to
him
but
now
when
his
sickness
was
brought
as
a
charge
against
him
was
adduced
as
a
reason
why
his
friends
should
interfere
and
look
after
him
and
concern
themselves
in
his
affairs
he
saw
at
once
that
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
make
little
of
his
ailments
would
it
not
be
best
trevelyan
that
you
should
come
with
me
to
a
doctor
said
sir
marmaduke
no
no
i
have
my
own
doctor
that
is
i
know
the
course
which
i
should
follow
this
place
though
it
is
good
for
the
boy
has
disagreed
with
me
and
my
life
has
not
been
altogether
pleasant
i
may
say
by
no
means
pleasant
troubles
have
told
upon
me
but
change
of
air
will
mend
it
all
i
wish
you
would
come
with
me
at
once
to
london
you
shall
come
back
you
know
i
will
not
detain
you
thank
you
no
i
will
not
trouble
you
that
will
do
fuller
you
have
intended
to
do
your
duty
no
doubt
and
now
you
can
go
whereupon
fuller
did
go
i
am
obliged
for
your
care
sir
marmaduke
but
i
can
really
do
very
well
without
troubling
you
you
can
not
suppose
trevelyan
that
we
can
allow
things
to
go
on
like
this
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
well
i
shall
take
advice
i
shall
go
to
a
lawyer
and
to
a
doctor
and
perhaps
to
the
lord
chancellor
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
we
ca
let
things
go
on
like
this
you
can
do
as
you
please
said
trevelyan
but
as
you
have
threatened
me
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
me
sir
marmaduke
could
do
no
more
and
could
say
no
more
and
he
took
his
leave
shaking
hands
with
the
man
and
speaking
to
him
with
a
courtesy
which
astonished
himself
it
was
impossible
to
maintain
the
strength
of
his
indignation
against
a
poor
creature
who
was
so
manifestly
unable
to
guide
himself
but
when
he
was
in
london
he
drove
at
once
to
the
house
of
trite
turbury
and
remained
there
till
the
doctor
returned
from
his
round
of
visits
according
to
the
great
authority
there
was
much
still
to
be
done
before
even
the
child
could
be
rescued
out
of
the
father
hands
i
ca
act
without
the
lawyers
said
turbury
but
he
explained
to
sir
marmaduke
what
steps
should
be
taken
in
such
a
matter
trevelyan
in
the
mean
time
clearly
understanding
that
hostile
measures
would
now
be
taken
against
him
set
his
mind
to
work
to
think
how
best
he
might
escape
at
once
to
america
with
his
boy
chapter
lxx
shewing
what
nora
rowley
thought
about
carriages
sir
marmaduke
on
his
return
home
from
turbury
house
found
that
he
had
other
domestic
troubles
on
hand
over
and
above
those
arising
from
his
elder
daughter
position
hugh
stanbury
had
been
in
manchester
street
during
his
absence
and
had
asked
for
him
and
finding
that
he
was
away
from
home
had
told
his
story
to
lady
rowley
when
he
had
been
shown
all
the
four
daughters
had
been
with
their
mother
but
he
had
said
a
word
or
two
signifying
his
desire
to
speak
to
lady
rowley
and
the
three
girls
had
left
the
room
in
this
way
it
came
to
pass
that
he
had
to
plead
his
cause
before
nora
mother
and
her
elder
sister
he
had
pleaded
it
well
and
lady
rowley
heart
had
been
well
disposed
towards
him
but
when
she
asked
of
his
house
and
his
home
his
answer
had
been
hardly
more
satisfactory
than
that
of
there
was
little
that
he
could
call
his
own
beyond
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
had
he
saved
any
money
no
not
a
shilling
that
was
to
say
as
he
himself
expressed
it
nothing
that
could
be
called
money
he
had
a
few
pounds
by
him
just
to
go
on
with
what
was
his
income
well
last
year
he
had
made
four
hundred
pounds
and
this
year
he
hoped
to
make
something
more
he
thought
he
could
see
his
way
plainly
to
five
hundred
a
year
was
it
permanent
and
if
not
on
what
did
it
depend
he
believed
it
to
be
as
permanent
as
most
other
professional
incomes
but
was
obliged
to
confess
that
as
regarded
the
source
from
whence
it
was
drawn
at
the
present
moment
it
might
be
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
any
day
by
a
disagreement
between
himself
and
the
editor
of
the
did
he
think
that
this
was
a
fixed
income
he
did
think
that
if
he
and
the
editor
of
the
were
to
fall
out
he
could
come
across
other
editors
who
would
gladly
employ
him
would
he
himself
feel
safe
in
giving
his
own
sister
to
a
man
with
such
an
income
in
answer
to
this
question
he
started
some
rather
bold
doctrines
on
the
subject
of
matrimony
in
general
asserting
that
safety
was
not
desirable
that
energy
patience
and
mutual
confidence
would
be
increased
by
the
excitement
of
risk
and
that
in
his
opinion
it
behoved
young
men
and
young
women
to
come
together
and
get
themselves
married
even
though
there
might
be
some
not
remote
danger
of
distress
before
them
he
admitted
that
starvation
would
be
disagreeable
especially
for
children
in
the
eyes
of
their
parents
but
alleged
that
children
as
a
rule
were
not
starved
and
quoted
the
scripture
to
prove
that
honest
laborious
men
were
not
to
be
seen
begging
their
bread
in
the
streets
he
was
very
eloquent
but
his
eloquence
itself
was
against
him
both
lady
rowley
and
trevelyan
were
afraid
of
such
advanced
opinions
and
although
everything
was
of
course
to
be
left
nominally
to
the
decision
of
sir
marmaduke
they
both
declared
that
they
could
not
recommend
sir
marmaduke
to
consent
lady
rowley
said
a
word
as
to
the
expediency
of
taking
nora
back
with
her
to
the
mandarins
pointing
out
what
appeared
to
her
then
to
be
the
necessity
of
taking
trevelyan
with
them
also
and
in
saying
this
she
hinted
that
if
nora
were
disposed
to
stand
by
her
engagement
and
stanbury
equally
so
disposed
there
might
be
some
possibility
of
a
marriage
at
a
future
period
only
in
such
case
there
must
be
no
correspondence
in
answer
to
this
hugh
declared
that
he
regarded
such
a
scheme
as
being
altogether
bad
the
mandarins
were
so
very
far
distant
that
he
might
as
well
be
engaged
to
an
angel
in
heaven
nora
if
she
were
to
go
away
now
would
perhaps
never
come
back
again
and
if
she
did
come
back
would
be
an
old
woman
with
hollow
cheeks
in
replying
to
this
proposition
he
let
fall
an
opinion
that
nora
was
old
enough
to
judge
for
herself
he
said
nothing
about
her
actual
age
and
did
not
venture
to
plead
that
the
young
lady
had
a
legal
right
to
do
as
she
liked
with
herself
but
he
made
it
manifest
that
such
an
idea
was
in
his
mind
in
answer
to
this
lady
rowley
asserted
that
nora
was
a
good
girl
and
would
do
as
her
father
told
her
but
she
did
not
venture
to
assert
that
nora
would
give
up
her
engagement
lady
rowley
at
last
undertook
to
speak
to
sir
rowley
and
to
speak
also
to
her
daughter
hugh
was
asked
for
his
address
and
gave
that
of
the
office
of
the
he
was
always
to
be
found
there
between
three
and
five
and
after
that
four
times
a
week
in
the
gallery
of
the
house
of
commons
then
he
was
at
some
pains
to
explain
to
lady
rowley
that
though
he
attended
the
reporters
gallery
he
did
not
report
himself
it
was
his
duty
to
write
leading
political
articles
and
to
enable
him
to
do
so
he
attended
the
debates
before
he
went
trevelyan
thanked
him
most
cordially
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
in
procuring
for
her
the
address
at
willesden
and
gave
him
some
account
of
the
journey
which
she
and
her
mother
had
made
to
river
cottage
he
argued
with
both
of
them
that
the
unfortunate
man
must
now
be
regarded
as
being
altogether
out
of
his
mind
and
something
was
said
as
to
the
great
wisdom
and
experience
of
trite
turbury
then
hugh
stanbury
took
his
leave
and
even
lady
rowley
bade
him
adieu
with
kind
cordiality
i
do
wonder
mamma
that
nora
should
like
him
said
trevelyan
that
is
all
very
well
my
dear
and
no
doubt
he
is
pleasant
and
manly
and
all
that
but
really
it
would
be
almost
like
marrying
a
beggar
for
myself
said
trevelyan
if
i
could
begin
life
again
i
do
not
think
that
any
temptation
would
induce
me
to
place
myself
in
a
man
power
sir
marmaduke
was
told
of
all
this
on
his
return
home
and
he
asked
many
questions
as
to
the
nature
of
stanbury
work
when
it
was
explained
to
him
lady
rowley
repeating
as
nearly
as
she
could
all
that
hugh
had
himself
said
about
it
he
expressed
his
opinion
that
writing
for
a
penny
newspaper
was
hardly
more
safe
as
a
source
of
income
than
betting
on
horse
races
i
do
see
that
it
is
wrong
said
trevelyan
i
say
nothing
about
wrong
i
simply
assert
that
it
is
uncertain
the
very
existence
of
such
a
periodical
must
in
itself
be
most
insecure
sir
marmaduke
amidst
the
cares
of
his
government
at
the
mandarins
had
perhaps
had
no
better
opportunity
of
watching
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
of
letters
than
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
miss
stanbury
at
exeter
i
think
your
papa
is
right
said
lady
rowley
of
course
i
am
right
it
is
out
of
the
question
and
so
nora
must
be
told
he
had
as
yet
heard
nothing
about
glascock
had
that
misfortune
been
communicated
to
him
his
cup
would
indeed
have
been
filled
with
sorrow
to
overflowing
in
the
evening
nora
was
closeted
with
her
father
nora
my
dear
you
must
understand
once
and
for
all
that
this
can
not
be
said
sir
marmaduke
the
governor
when
he
was
not
disturbed
by
outward
circumstances
could
assume
a
good
deal
of
personal
dignity
and
could
speak
especially
to
his
children
with
an
air
of
indisputable
authority
what
ca
be
papa
said
nora
sir
marmaduke
perceived
at
once
that
there
was
no
indication
of
obedience
in
his
daughter
voice
and
he
prepared
himself
for
battle
he
conceived
himself
to
be
very
strong
and
thought
that
his
objections
were
so
well
founded
that
no
one
would
deny
their
truth
and
that
his
daughter
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
this
that
your
mamma
tells
me
of
about
stanbury
do
you
know
my
dear
that
he
has
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
i
know
that
he
has
no
fortune
papa
if
you
mean
that
and
no
profession
either
nothing
that
can
be
called
a
profession
i
do
not
wish
to
argue
it
my
dear
because
there
is
no
room
for
argument
the
whole
thing
is
preposterous
i
can
not
but
think
ill
of
him
for
having
proposed
it
to
you
for
he
must
have
known
must
have
known
that
a
young
man
without
an
income
can
not
be
accepted
as
a
fitting
suitor
for
a
gentleman
daughter
as
for
yourself
i
can
only
hope
that
you
will
get
the
little
idea
out
of
your
head
very
quickly
but
mamma
will
speak
to
you
about
that
what
i
want
you
to
understand
from
me
is
this
that
there
must
be
an
end
to
it
nora
listened
to
this
speech
in
perfect
silence
standing
before
her
father
and
waiting
patiently
till
the
last
word
of
it
should
be
pronounced
even
when
he
had
finished
she
still
paused
before
she
answered
him
papa
she
said
at
last
and
hesitated
again
before
she
went
on
well
my
dear
i
can
not
give
it
up
but
you
must
give
it
up
illustration
but
you
must
give
it
up
said
sir
marmaduke
no
papa
i
would
do
anything
i
could
for
you
and
mamma
but
that
is
impossible
why
is
it
impossible
because
i
love
him
so
dearly
that
is
nonsense
that
is
what
all
girls
say
when
they
choose
to
run
against
their
parents
i
tell
you
that
it
shall
be
given
up
i
will
not
have
him
here
i
forbid
you
to
see
him
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
that
you
should
marry
such
a
man
i
do
hope
nora
that
you
are
not
going
to
add
to
mamma
difficulties
and
mine
by
being
obstinate
and
disobedient
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
more
to
be
said
papa
my
dear
i
think
you
had
better
say
nothing
further
about
it
if
you
can
not
bring
yourself
at
the
present
moment
to
promise
that
there
shall
be
an
end
of
it
you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
you
have
heard
what
i
say
and
you
have
heard
what
mamma
says
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
you
dream
of
carrying
on
a
communication
with
this
gentleman
in
opposition
to
our
wishes
but
i
do
do
what
papa
you
had
better
listen
to
me
sir
marmaduke
when
he
heard
this
assumed
an
air
of
increased
authority
in
which
he
intended
that
paternal
anger
should
be
visible
but
he
seated
himself
and
prepared
to
receive
at
any
rate
some
of
the
arguments
with
which
nora
intended
to
bolster
up
her
bad
cause
i
have
promised
stanbury
that
i
will
be
his
wife
that
is
all
nonsense
do
listen
to
me
papa
i
have
listened
to
you
and
you
ought
to
listen
to
me
i
have
promised
him
and
i
must
keep
my
promise
i
shall
keep
my
promise
if
he
wishes
it
there
is
a
time
when
a
girl
must
be
supposed
to
know
what
is
best
for
herself
just
as
there
is
for
a
man
i
never
heard
such
stuff
in
all
my
life
do
you
mean
that
you
go
out
and
marry
him
like
a
beggar
with
nothing
but
what
you
stand
up
in
with
no
friend
to
be
with
you
an
outcast
thrown
off
by
your
mother
with
your
father
curse
oh
papa
do
not
say
that
you
would
not
curse
me
you
could
not
if
you
do
it
at
all
that
will
be
the
way
that
will
not
be
the
way
papa
you
could
not
treat
me
like
that
and
how
are
you
proposing
to
treat
me
but
papa
in
whatever
way
i
do
it
i
must
do
it
i
do
not
say
or
but
it
must
be
the
intention
and
purpose
of
my
life
and
i
must
declare
that
it
is
everywhere
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
it
i
am
engaged
to
him
and
i
shall
always
say
so
unless
he
breaks
it
i
do
care
a
bit
about
fortune
i
thought
i
did
once
but
i
have
changed
all
that
because
this
scoundrel
has
talked
sedition
to
you
he
is
not
a
scoundrel
papa
and
he
has
not
talked
sedition
i
know
what
sedition
is
i
thought
it
meant
treason
and
i
sure
he
is
not
a
traitor
he
has
made
me
love
him
and
i
shall
be
true
to
him
hereupon
sir
marmaduke
began
almost
to
weep
there
came
first
a
oath
and
then
a
sob
and
he
walked
about
the
room
and
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
and
rubbed
his
bald
head
impatiently
with
his
hand
nora
he
said
i
thought
you
were
so
different
from
this
if
i
had
believed
this
of
you
you
never
should
have
come
to
england
with
emily
it
is
too
late
for
that
now
papa
your
mamma
always
told
me
that
you
had
such
excellent
ideas
about
marriage
so
i
have
i
think
said
she
smiling
she
always
believed
that
you
would
make
a
match
that
would
be
a
credit
to
the
family
i
tried
it
papa
the
sort
of
match
that
you
mean
indeed
i
was
mercenary
enough
in
what
i
believed
to
be
my
views
of
life
i
meant
to
marry
a
rich
man
if
i
could
and
did
not
think
much
whether
i
should
love
him
or
not
but
when
the
rich
man
came
what
rich
man
i
suppose
mamma
has
told
you
about
mr
glascock
who
is
glascock
i
have
not
heard
a
word
about
mr
glascock
then
nora
was
forced
to
tell
her
story
was
called
upon
to
tell
it
with
all
its
aggravating
details
by
degrees
sir
marmaduke
learned
that
this
glascock
who
had
desired
to
be
his
was
in
very
truth
the
heir
to
the
peterborough
title
and
estates
would
have
been
such
a
as
almost
to
compensate
by
the
brilliance
of
the
connection
for
that
other
unfortunate
alliance
he
could
hardly
control
his
agony
when
he
was
made
to
understand
that
this
embryo
peer
had
in
truth
been
in
earnest
do
you
mean
that
he
went
down
after
you
into
devonshire
yes
papa
and
you
refused
him
then
a
second
time
yes
papa
why
why
why
you
say
yourself
that
you
liked
him
that
you
thought
that
you
would
accept
him
when
it
came
to
speaking
the
word
papa
i
found
that
i
could
not
pretend
to
love
him
when
i
did
not
love
him
i
did
not
care
for
him
and
i
liked
somebody
else
so
much
better
i
just
told
him
the
plain
truth
and
so
he
went
away
the
thought
of
all
that
he
had
lost
of
all
that
might
so
easily
have
been
his
for
a
time
overwhelmed
sir
marmaduke
and
drove
the
very
memory
of
hugh
stanbury
almost
out
of
his
head
he
could
understand
that
a
girl
should
not
marry
a
man
whom
she
did
not
like
but
he
could
not
understand
how
any
girl
should
not
love
such
a
suitor
as
was
glascock
and
had
she
accepted
this
pearl
of
men
with
her
position
with
her
manners
and
beauty
and
appearance
such
a
connection
would
have
been
as
good
as
an
assured
marriage
for
every
one
of
sir
marmaduke
numerous
daughters
nora
was
just
the
woman
to
look
like
a
great
lady
a
lady
of
high
rank
such
a
lady
as
could
almost
command
men
to
come
and
throw
themselves
at
her
unmarried
sisters
feet
sir
marmaduke
had
believed
in
his
daughter
nora
had
looked
forward
to
see
her
do
much
for
the
family
and
when
the
crash
had
come
upon
the
trevelyan
household
had
thought
almost
as
much
of
her
injured
prospects
as
he
had
of
the
misfortune
of
her
sister
but
now
it
seemed
that
more
than
all
the
good
things
of
what
he
had
dreamed
had
been
proposed
to
this
unruly
girl
in
spite
of
that
great
crash
and
had
been
rejected
and
he
saw
more
than
this
as
he
thought
these
good
things
would
have
been
accepted
had
it
not
been
for
this
rascal
of
a
this
friend
of
that
other
rascal
trevelyan
who
had
come
in
the
way
of
their
family
to
destroy
the
happiness
of
them
all
sir
marmaduke
in
speaking
of
stanbury
after
this
would
constantly
call
him
a
thinking
that
the
contamination
of
the
penny
communicated
itself
to
all
transactions
of
the
daily
record
you
have
made
your
bed
for
yourself
nora
and
you
must
lie
upon
it
just
so
papa
i
mean
that
as
you
have
refused
glascock
offer
you
can
never
again
hope
for
such
an
opening
in
life
of
course
i
can
not
i
am
not
such
a
child
as
to
suppose
that
there
are
many
glascocks
to
come
and
run
after
me
and
if
there
were
ever
so
many
papa
it
would
be
no
good
as
you
say
i
have
chosen
for
myself
and
i
must
put
up
with
it
when
i
see
the
carriages
going
about
in
the
streets
and
remember
how
often
i
shall
have
to
go
home
in
an
omnibus
i
do
think
about
it
a
good
deal
i
afraid
you
will
think
when
it
is
too
late
it
is
that
i
do
like
carriages
papa
i
do
like
them
and
pretty
dresses
and
brooches
and
men
and
women
who
have
nothing
to
do
and
balls
and
the
opera
but
i
love
this
man
and
that
is
more
to
me
than
all
the
rest
i
can
not
help
myself
if
it
were
ever
so
papa
you
must
be
angry
with
me
pray
pray
pray
do
not
say
that
horrid
word
again
this
was
the
end
of
the
interview
sir
marmaduke
found
that
he
had
nothing
further
to
say
nora
when
she
reached
her
last
prayer
to
her
father
referring
to
that
curse
with
which
he
had
threatened
her
was
herself
in
tears
and
was
leaning
on
him
with
her
head
against
his
shoulder
of
course
he
did
not
say
a
word
which
could
be
understood
as
sanctioning
her
engagement
with
stanbury
he
was
as
strongly
determined
as
ever
that
it
was
his
duty
to
save
her
from
the
perils
of
such
a
marriage
as
that
but
nevertheless
he
was
so
far
overcome
by
her
as
to
be
softened
in
his
manners
towards
her
he
kissed
her
as
he
left
her
and
told
her
to
go
to
her
mother
then
he
went
out
and
thought
of
it
all
and
felt
as
though
paradise
had
been
opened
to
his
child
and
she
had
refused
to
enter
the
gate
chapter
lxxi
shewing
what
hugh
stanbury
thought
about
the
duty
of
man
in
the
conference
which
took
place
between
sir
marmaduke
and
his
wife
after
the
interview
between
him
and
nora
it
was
his
idea
that
nothing
further
should
be
done
at
all
i
do
suppose
the
man
will
come
here
if
he
be
told
not
said
sir
marmaduke
and
if
he
does
nora
of
course
will
not
see
him
he
then
suggested
that
nora
would
of
course
go
back
with
them
to
the
mandarins
and
that
when
once
there
she
would
not
be
able
to
see
stanbury
any
more
there
must
be
no
correspondence
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
so
the
thing
will
die
away
but
lady
rowley
declared
that
this
would
not
quite
suffice
stanbury
had
made
his
offer
in
due
form
and
must
be
held
to
be
entitled
to
an
answer
sir
marmaduke
therefore
wrote
the
following
letter
to
the
mitigating
the
asperity
of
his
language
in
compliance
with
his
wife
counsels
manchester
street
april
my
dear
sir
lady
rowley
has
told
me
of
your
proposal
to
my
daughter
nora
and
she
has
told
me
also
what
she
learned
from
you
as
to
your
circumstances
in
life
i
need
hardly
point
out
to
you
that
no
father
would
be
justified
in
giving
his
daughter
to
a
gentleman
upon
so
small
an
income
and
upon
an
income
so
very
insecure
i
am
obliged
to
refuse
my
consent
and
i
must
therefore
ask
you
to
abstain
from
visiting
and
from
communicating
with
my
daughter
yours
faithfully
marmaduke
rowley
hugh
stanbury
esq
this
letter
was
directed
to
stanbury
at
the
office
of
the
and
sir
marmaduke
as
he
wrote
the
pernicious
address
felt
himself
injured
in
that
he
was
compelled
to
write
about
his
daughter
to
a
man
so
circumstanced
stanbury
when
he
got
the
letter
read
it
hastily
and
then
threw
it
aside
he
knew
what
it
would
contain
before
he
opened
it
he
had
heard
enough
from
lady
rowley
to
be
aware
that
sir
marmaduke
would
not
welcome
him
as
a
indeed
he
had
never
expected
such
welcome
he
was
of
his
own
suit
because
of
the
lowliness
of
his
position
that
he
should
have
induced
such
a
girl
as
nora
rowley
to
give
up
for
his
sake
her
hopes
of
magnificence
and
splendour
but
sir
marmaduke
letter
did
not
add
anything
to
this
feeling
he
read
it
again
and
smiled
as
he
told
himself
that
the
father
would
certainly
be
very
weak
in
the
hands
of
his
daughter
then
he
went
to
work
again
at
his
article
with
a
persistent
resolve
that
so
small
a
trifle
as
such
a
note
should
have
no
effect
upon
his
daily
work
of
course
sir
marmaduke
would
refuse
his
consent
of
course
it
would
be
for
him
stanbury
to
marry
the
girl
he
loved
in
opposition
to
her
father
her
father
indeed
if
nora
chose
to
take
him
and
as
to
that
he
was
very
doubtful
as
to
wisdom
but
if
nora
would
take
him
what
was
any
father
opposition
to
him
he
wanted
nothing
from
nora
father
he
was
not
looking
for
money
with
his
wife
nor
for
fashion
nor
countenance
such
a
bohemian
was
he
that
he
would
be
quite
satisfied
if
his
girl
would
walk
out
to
him
and
become
his
wife
with
any
on
and
with
any
old
hat
that
might
come
readiest
to
hand
he
wanted
neither
cards
nor
breakfast
nor
carriages
nor
fine
clothes
if
his
nora
should
choose
to
come
to
him
as
she
was
he
having
had
all
previous
necessary
arrangements
duly
made
such
as
calling
of
banns
or
procuring
of
licence
if
possible
he
thought
that
a
opposition
would
almost
add
something
to
the
pleasure
of
the
occasion
so
he
pitched
the
letter
on
one
side
and
went
on
with
his
article
and
he
finished
his
article
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
it
was
completed
with
the
full
strength
and
pith
needed
for
moving
the
pulses
of
the
national
mind
as
they
should
be
moved
by
leading
articles
in
the
as
he
was
writing
he
was
thinking
of
nora
and
thinking
of
the
letter
which
nora
father
had
sent
to
him
trivial
as
was
the
letter
he
could
not
keep
himself
from
repeating
the
words
of
it
to
himself
hardly
point
out
oh
need
he
then
why
does
he
refusing
his
consent
i
wonder
what
the
old
buffers
think
is
the
meaning
of
their
consent
when
they
are
speaking
of
daughters
old
enough
to
manage
for
themselves
abstain
from
visiting
or
communicating
with
her
but
if
she
visits
and
communicates
with
me
what
then
i
ca
force
my
way
into
the
house
but
she
can
force
her
way
out
does
he
imagine
that
she
can
be
locked
up
in
the
nursery
or
put
into
the
corner
so
he
argued
with
himself
and
by
such
arguments
he
brought
himself
to
the
conviction
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
answer
sir
marmaduke
letter
this
he
did
at
once
before
leaving
the
office
of
the
fleet
street
april
my
dear
sir
marmaduke
rowley
i
have
just
received
your
letter
and
am
indeed
sorry
that
its
contents
should
be
so
little
favourable
to
my
hopes
i
understand
that
your
objection
to
me
is
simply
in
regard
to
the
smallness
and
insecurity
of
my
income
on
the
first
point
i
may
say
that
i
have
fair
hopes
that
it
may
be
at
once
increased
as
to
the
second
i
believe
i
may
assert
that
it
is
as
sure
at
least
as
the
income
of
other
professional
men
such
as
barristers
merchants
and
doctors
i
can
not
promise
to
say
that
i
will
not
see
your
daughter
if
she
desires
me
to
do
so
of
course
i
shall
be
guided
by
her
views
i
wish
that
i
might
be
allowed
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
as
i
think
i
could
reverse
or
at
least
mitigate
some
of
the
objections
which
you
feel
to
our
marriage
yours
most
faithfully
hugh
stanbury
on
the
next
day
but
one
sir
marmaduke
came
to
him
he
was
sitting
at
the
office
of
the
in
a
very
small
and
dirty
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
sir
marmaduke
found
his
way
thither
through
a
confused
crowd
of
compositors
pressmen
and
printers
boys
he
thought
that
he
had
never
before
been
in
a
place
so
foul
so
dark
so
crowded
and
so
comfortless
he
himself
was
accustomed
to
do
his
work
out
in
the
islands
with
many
of
the
appanages
of
around
him
he
had
his
secretary
and
his
private
secretary
and
his
and
his
and
not
unfrequently
he
had
the
honour
of
a
dusky
sentinel
walking
before
the
door
through
which
he
was
to
be
approached
he
had
an
idea
that
all
gentlemen
at
their
work
had
comfortable
appurtenances
around
them
such
as
carpets
unlimited
stationery
easy
chairs
for
temporary
leisure
big
and
a
small
world
of
books
around
them
to
give
at
least
a
look
of
erudition
to
their
pursuits
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
in
the
miserably
dark
room
occupied
by
stanbury
he
was
sitting
at
a
wretched
little
table
on
which
there
was
nothing
but
a
morsel
of
blotting
paper
a
small
and
the
paper
on
which
he
was
scribbling
there
was
no
carpet
there
and
no
and
the
only
book
in
the
room
was
a
little
dictionary
sir
marmaduke
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
said
hugh
i
fear
you
will
find
this
place
a
little
rough
but
we
shall
be
all
alone
the
place
stanbury
will
not
signify
i
think
not
in
the
least
if
you
do
mind
it
i
got
your
letter
you
know
sir
marmaduke
and
i
have
had
your
reply
i
have
come
to
you
because
you
have
expressed
a
wish
for
an
interview
but
i
do
not
see
that
it
will
do
any
good
you
are
very
kind
for
coming
indeed
sir
marmaduke
very
kind
i
thought
i
might
explain
something
to
you
about
my
income
can
you
tell
me
that
you
have
any
permanent
income
it
goes
on
regularly
from
month
to
month
sir
marmaduke
did
not
feel
the
slightest
respect
for
an
income
that
was
paid
monthly
according
to
his
ideas
a
gentleman
income
should
be
paid
quarterly
or
perhaps
according
to
his
view
a
monthly
salary
was
only
one
degree
better
than
weekly
wages
and
i
suppose
that
is
permanence
said
hugh
stanbury
i
can
not
say
that
i
so
regard
it
a
barrister
gets
his
you
know
very
irregularly
there
is
no
saying
when
he
may
have
it
but
a
barrister
profession
is
recognised
as
a
profession
among
gentlemen
mr
stanbury
and
is
not
ours
recognised
which
of
us
barristers
or
men
of
literature
have
the
most
effect
on
the
world
at
large
who
is
most
thought
of
in
london
sir
marmaduke
the
lord
chancellor
or
the
editor
of
the
the
lord
chancellor
a
great
deal
said
sir
marmaduke
quite
dismayed
by
the
audacity
of
the
question
by
no
means
sir
marmaduke
said
stanbury
throwing
out
his
hand
before
him
so
as
to
give
the
energy
of
action
to
his
words
he
has
the
higher
rank
i
will
admit
that
i
should
think
so
said
sir
marmaduke
and
the
larger
income
very
much
larger
i
should
say
said
sir
marmaduke
with
a
smile
and
he
wears
a
wig
yes
he
wears
a
wig
said
sir
marmaduke
hardly
knowing
in
what
spirit
to
accept
this
assertion
and
nobody
cares
one
brass
button
for
him
or
his
opinions
said
stanbury
bringing
down
his
hand
heavily
on
the
little
table
for
the
sake
of
emphasis
what
sir
if
you
think
of
it
it
is
so
nobody
cares
for
the
lord
chancellor
it
certainly
is
the
fact
that
gentlemen
living
in
the
mandarin
islands
do
think
more
of
the
lord
chancellor
and
the
lord
mayor
and
the
and
the
lord
chamberlain
than
they
whose
spheres
of
life
bring
them
into
closer
contact
with
those
august
functionaries
i
presume
stanbury
that
a
connection
with
a
penny
newspaper
makes
such
opinions
as
these
almost
a
necessity
quite
a
necessity
sir
marmaduke
no
man
can
hold
his
own
in
print
unless
he
can
see
the
difference
between
tinsel
and
gold
and
the
lord
chancellor
of
course
is
tinsel
i
do
not
say
so
he
may
be
a
great
lawyer
and
very
useful
but
his
lordship
and
his
wig
and
his
woolsack
are
tinsel
in
comparison
with
the
real
power
possessed
by
the
editor
of
a
leading
newspaper
if
the
lord
chancellor
were
to
go
to
bed
for
a
month
would
he
be
much
missed
i
do
know
sir
i
not
in
the
secrets
of
the
cabinet
i
should
think
he
would
about
as
much
as
my
grandmother
but
if
the
editor
of
the
were
to
be
taken
ill
it
would
work
quite
a
commotion
for
myself
i
should
be
glad
on
public
grounds
because
i
do
like
his
mode
of
business
but
it
would
have
an
effect
because
he
is
a
leading
man
i
do
see
what
all
this
leads
to
mr
stanbury
only
to
this
that
we
who
write
for
the
press
think
that
our
calling
is
recognised
and
must
be
recognised
as
a
profession
talk
of
permanence
sir
marmaduke
are
not
the
newspapers
permanent
do
not
they
come
out
regularly
every
day
and
more
of
them
and
still
more
of
them
are
always
coming
out
you
do
not
expect
a
collapse
among
them
there
will
be
plenty
of
newspapers
i
do
not
doubt
more
than
plenty
perhaps
somebody
must
write
them
and
the
writers
will
be
paid
anybody
could
write
the
most
of
them
i
should
say
i
wish
you
would
try
sir
marmaduke
just
try
your
hand
at
a
leading
article
and
read
it
yourself
morning
i
a
great
deal
too
much
to
do
mr
stanbury
just
so
you
have
no
doubt
the
affairs
of
your
government
to
look
to
we
are
all
so
apt
to
ignore
the
work
of
our
neighbours
it
seems
to
me
that
i
could
go
over
and
govern
the
mandarins
without
the
slightest
trouble
in
the
world
but
no
doubt
i
am
mistaken
just
as
you
are
about
writing
for
the
newspapers
i
do
not
know
said
sir
marmaduke
rising
from
his
chair
with
dignity
that
i
called
here
to
discuss
such
matters
as
these
as
it
happens
you
stanbury
are
not
the
governor
of
the
mandarins
and
i
have
not
the
honour
to
write
for
the
columns
of
the
penny
newspaper
with
which
you
are
associated
it
is
therefore
useless
to
discuss
what
either
of
us
might
do
in
the
position
held
by
the
other
altogether
useless
sir
marmaduke
except
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
do
not
see
the
fun
stanbury
i
came
here
at
your
request
to
hear
what
you
might
have
to
urge
against
the
decision
which
i
expressed
to
you
in
reference
to
my
daughter
as
it
seems
that
you
have
nothing
to
urge
i
will
not
take
up
your
time
further
but
i
have
a
great
deal
to
urge
and
have
urged
a
great
deal
have
you
indeed
you
have
complained
that
my
work
is
not
permanent
i
have
shewn
that
it
is
so
permanent
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
its
coming
to
an
end
there
must
be
newspapers
and
the
people
trained
to
write
them
must
be
employed
i
have
been
at
it
now
about
two
years
you
know
what
i
earn
could
i
have
got
so
far
in
so
short
a
time
as
a
lawyer
a
doctor
a
clergyman
a
soldier
a
sailor
a
government
clerk
or
in
any
of
those
employments
which
you
choose
to
call
professions
i
think
that
is
urging
a
great
deal
i
think
it
is
urging
everything
very
well
stanbury
i
have
listened
to
you
and
in
a
certain
degree
i
admire
your
your
your
zeal
and
ingenuity
shall
i
say
i
did
mean
to
call
for
admiration
sir
marmaduke
but
suppose
you
say
good
sense
and
discrimination
let
that
pass
you
must
permit
me
to
remark
that
your
position
is
not
such
as
to
justify
me
in
trusting
my
daughter
to
your
care
as
my
mind
on
that
matter
is
quite
made
up
as
is
that
also
of
lady
rowley
i
must
ask
you
to
give
me
your
promise
that
your
suit
to
my
daughter
shall
be
discontinued
what
does
she
say
about
it
sir
marmaduke
what
she
has
said
to
me
has
been
for
my
ears
and
not
for
yours
what
i
say
is
for
her
ears
and
for
yours
and
for
her
mother
ears
and
for
the
ears
of
any
who
may
choose
to
hear
it
i
will
never
give
up
my
suit
to
your
daughter
till
i
am
forced
to
do
so
by
a
full
conviction
that
she
has
given
me
up
it
is
best
to
be
plain
sir
marmaduke
of
course
i
do
not
understand
this
mr
stanbury
i
mean
to
be
quite
clear
i
have
always
thought
that
when
a
gentleman
was
told
by
the
head
of
a
family
that
he
could
not
be
made
welcome
in
that
family
it
was
considered
to
be
the
duty
of
that
gentleman
as
a
gentleman
to
abandon
his
vain
pursuit
i
have
been
brought
up
with
that
idea
and
i
sir
marmaduke
have
been
brought
up
in
the
idea
that
when
a
man
has
won
the
affections
of
a
woman
it
is
the
duty
of
that
man
as
a
man
to
stick
to
her
through
thick
and
thin
and
i
mean
to
do
my
duty
according
to
my
idea
then
sir
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
but
to
take
my
leave
i
must
only
caution
you
not
to
enter
my
doors
as
the
passages
were
dark
and
intricate
it
was
necessary
that
stanbury
should
shew
sir
marmaduke
out
and
this
he
did
in
silence
when
they
parted
each
of
them
lifted
his
hat
and
not
a
word
more
was
said
that
same
night
there
was
a
note
put
into
nora
hands
as
she
was
following
her
mother
out
of
one
of
the
theatres
in
the
confusion
she
did
not
even
see
the
messenger
who
had
handed
it
to
her
her
sister
lucy
saw
that
she
had
taken
the
note
and
questioned
her
about
it
afterwards
with
discretion
however
and
in
privacy
this
was
the
note
dearest
love
i
have
seen
your
father
who
is
stern
after
the
manner
of
fathers
what
granite
equals
a
parent
flinty
bosom
for
myself
i
do
not
prefer
clandestine
arrangements
and
rope
ladders
and
you
dear
have
nothing
of
the
lydia
about
you
but
i
do
like
my
own
way
and
like
it
especially
when
you
are
at
the
end
of
the
path
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
that
you
should
go
back
to
those
islands
i
think
i
am
justified
in
already
assuming
enough
of
the
husband
to
declare
that
such
going
back
must
not
be
held
for
a
moment
in
question
my
proposition
is
that
you
should
authorise
me
to
make
such
arrangements
as
may
be
needed
in
regard
to
licence
banns
or
whatever
else
and
that
you
should
then
simply
walk
from
the
house
to
the
church
and
marry
me
you
are
of
age
and
can
do
as
you
please
neither
your
father
nor
mother
can
have
any
right
to
stop
you
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
your
mother
would
accompany
you
if
she
were
fully
satisfied
of
your
purpose
write
to
me
to
the
your
own
ever
and
ever
and
always
i
shall
try
and
get
this
given
to
you
as
you
leave
the
theatre
if
it
should
fall
into
other
hands
i
do
much
care
i
not
in
the
least
ashamed
of
what
i
am
doing
and
i
hope
that
you
are
not
chapter
lxxii
the
delivery
of
the
lamb
illustration
it
is
hoped
that
a
certain
quarter
of
lamb
will
not
have
been
forgotten
a
quarter
of
lamb
that
was
sent
as
a
from
exeter
to
nuncombe
putney
by
the
hands
of
miss
stanbury
martha
not
with
purposes
of
corruption
not
intended
to
buy
back
the
allegiance
of
dorothy
folded
delicately
and
temptingly
in
one
of
the
best
table
napkins
with
no
idea
of
bribery
but
sent
as
presents
used
to
be
sent
of
old
in
the
trains
of
great
ambassadors
as
signs
of
friendship
and
marks
of
true
respect
miss
stanbury
was
no
doubt
most
anxious
that
her
niece
should
return
to
her
but
was
not
herself
low
spirited
enough
to
conceive
that
a
quarter
of
lamb
could
be
efficacious
in
procuring
such
return
if
it
might
be
that
dorothy
heart
could
be
touched
by
mention
of
the
weariness
of
her
aunt
solitary
life
and
if
therefore
she
would
return
it
would
be
very
well
but
it
could
not
be
well
so
unless
the
offer
should
come
from
dorothy
herself
all
of
which
martha
had
been
made
to
understand
by
her
mistress
considerable
ingenuity
having
been
exercised
in
the
matter
on
each
side
on
her
arrival
at
lessboro
martha
had
hired
a
fly
and
been
driven
out
to
nuncombe
putney
but
she
felt
she
knew
not
why
a
dislike
to
be
taken
in
her
carriage
to
the
door
of
the
cottage
and
was
put
down
in
the
middle
of
the
village
from
whence
she
walked
out
to
stanbury
abode
with
the
basket
upon
her
arm
it
was
a
good
half
mile
and
the
lamb
was
heavy
for
miss
stanbury
had
suggested
that
a
bottle
of
sherry
should
be
put
in
under
the
napkin
and
martha
was
becoming
tired
of
her
burden
when
whom
should
she
see
on
the
road
before
her
but
brooke
burgess
as
she
said
herself
afterwards
it
immediately
occurred
to
her
that
all
the
fat
was
in
the
fire
here
had
this
young
man
come
down
passing
through
exeter
without
even
a
visit
to
miss
stanbury
and
had
clandestinely
sought
out
the
young
woman
whom
he
was
to
marry
and
here
was
the
young
woman
herself
flying
in
her
aunt
face
when
one
scratch
of
a
pen
might
ruin
them
both
martha
entertained
a
sacred
awful
overcoming
feeling
about
her
mistress
will
that
she
was
to
have
something
herself
she
supposed
and
her
anxiety
was
not
on
that
score
but
she
had
heard
so
much
about
it
had
realised
so
fully
the
great
power
which
miss
stanbury
possessed
and
had
had
her
own
feelings
so
rudely
invaded
by
alterations
in
miss
stanbury
plans
that
she
had
come
to
entertain
an
idea
that
all
persons
around
her
should
continually
bear
that
will
in
their
memory
hugh
had
undoubtedly
been
her
favourite
and
could
martha
have
dictated
the
will
herself
she
would
still
have
made
hugh
the
heir
but
she
had
realised
the
resolution
of
her
mistress
so
far
as
to
confess
that
the
bulk
of
the
property
was
to
go
back
to
a
burgess
but
there
were
very
many
burgesses
and
here
was
the
one
who
had
been
selected
flying
in
the
very
face
of
the
testatrix
what
was
to
be
done
were
she
to
go
back
and
not
tell
her
mistress
that
she
had
seen
brooke
burgess
at
nuncombe
then
should
the
fact
be
found
out
would
the
devoted
anger
of
miss
stanbury
fall
upon
her
own
head
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
tell
the
story
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
but
the
consequences
probably
would
be
very
dreadful
brooke
that
is
not
you
she
said
as
she
came
up
to
him
putting
her
basket
down
in
the
middle
of
the
dusty
road
then
who
can
it
be
said
brooke
giving
her
his
hand
to
shake
but
what
do
bring
you
here
brooke
goodness
me
what
will
missus
say
i
shall
make
that
all
straight
i
going
back
to
exeter
then
there
were
many
questions
and
many
answers
he
was
sojourning
at
crocket
and
had
been
there
for
the
last
two
days
dear
dear
dear
she
said
over
and
over
again
deary
me
deary
me
and
then
she
asked
him
whether
it
was
all
along
of
miss
dorothy
that
he
had
come
of
course
it
was
all
along
of
miss
dorothy
brooke
made
no
secret
about
it
he
had
come
down
to
see
dorothy
mother
and
sister
and
to
say
a
bit
of
his
own
mind
about
future
affairs
and
to
see
the
beauties
of
the
country
when
he
talked
about
the
beauties
of
the
country
martha
looked
at
him
as
the
people
of
lessboro
and
nuncombe
putney
should
have
looked
at
colonel
osborne
when
he
talked
of
the
church
porch
at
cockchaffington
beauties
of
the
country
brooke
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
martha
but
i
ai
the
least
in
the
world
said
brooke
then
martha
took
up
her
basket
and
went
on
to
the
cottage
which
had
been
close
in
sight
during
their
conversation
in
the
road
she
felt
angry
with
dorothy
in
such
matters
a
woman
is
always
angry
with
the
woman
who
has
probably
been
quite
passive
and
rarely
with
the
man
who
is
ever
the
real
transgressor
having
a
man
down
after
her
at
nuncombe
putney
it
had
never
struck
martha
as
very
horrible
that
brooke
burgess
should
fall
in
love
with
dorothy
in
the
city
but
this
meeting
in
the
remoteness
of
the
country
out
of
sight
even
of
the
village
was
almost
indecent
and
all
too
with
miss
will
just
as
one
might
say
on
the
balance
dorothy
ought
to
have
buried
herself
rather
than
have
allowed
brooke
to
see
her
at
nuncombe
putney
and
dorothy
mother
and
priscilla
must
be
worse
she
trudged
on
however
with
her
lamb
and
soon
found
herself
in
the
presence
of
the
three
ladies
what
martha
said
dorothy
yes
miss
here
i
am
i
have
been
here
ago
amost
if
i
had
been
stopped
on
the
road
and
who
stopped
you
asked
priscilla
why
brooke
of
course
and
what
did
brooke
say
to
you
asked
dorothy
martha
perceived
at
once
that
dorothy
was
quite
radiant
she
told
her
mistress
that
she
had
never
seen
miss
dorothy
look
half
so
comely
before
laws
she
brightened
up
and
speckled
about
till
it
did
your
heart
good
to
see
her
in
spite
of
all
but
this
was
some
time
afterwards
he
did
say
very
much
replied
martha
gravely
but
i
got
very
much
to
tell
you
continued
dorothy
i
engaged
to
be
married
to
brooke
and
you
must
congratulate
me
it
is
settled
now
and
mamma
and
my
sister
know
all
about
it
martha
when
she
was
thus
asked
directly
for
congratulation
hardly
knew
at
once
how
to
express
herself
being
fully
aware
of
miss
stanbury
objection
to
the
marriage
she
could
not
venture
to
express
her
approbation
of
it
it
was
very
improper
in
mind
that
any
young
woman
should
have
a
follower
when
the
missus
did
approve
of
it
she
understood
well
enough
that
in
that
matter
of
followers
privileges
are
allowed
to
young
ladies
which
are
not
accorded
to
maid
servants
a
young
lady
may
do
things
have
young
men
to
walk
and
talk
with
them
to
dance
with
them
and
embrace
them
and
perhaps
even
more
than
this
when
for
half
so
much
a
young
woman
would
be
turned
into
the
streets
without
a
character
martha
knew
all
this
and
knew
also
that
miss
dorothy
though
her
mother
lived
in
a
very
little
cottage
was
not
altogether
debarred
in
the
matter
of
followers
from
the
privileges
of
a
lady
but
yet
miss
position
was
so
very
peculiar
look
at
that
will
or
rather
at
that
embryo
will
which
might
be
made
any
day
which
now
probably
would
be
made
and
which
might
affect
them
both
so
terribly
people
who
have
not
got
money
should
not
fly
in
the
face
of
those
who
have
such
at
least
was
martha
opinion
very
strongly
how
could
she
congratulate
miss
dorothy
under
the
existing
circumstances
i
do
hope
you
will
be
happy
miss
that
you
knows
said
martha
in
her
difficulty
and
now
miss
i
mean
she
added
correcting
herself
in
obedience
to
miss
stanbury
direct
orders
about
the
present
missus
has
just
sent
me
over
with
a
bit
of
lamb
and
a
letter
as
is
here
in
the
basket
and
to
ask
how
you
is
and
the
other
ladies
we
are
very
much
obliged
said
stanbury
who
had
not
understood
the
point
of
martha
speech
my
sister
is
i
sure
said
priscilla
who
had
understood
it
dorothy
had
taken
the
letter
and
had
gone
aside
with
it
and
was
reading
it
very
carefully
it
touched
her
nearly
and
there
had
come
tears
into
both
her
eyes
as
she
dwelt
upon
it
there
was
something
in
her
aunt
allusion
to
the
condition
of
unmarried
women
which
came
home
to
her
especially
she
knew
her
aunt
past
history
and
now
she
knew
or
hoped
that
she
knew
something
of
her
own
future
destiny
her
aunt
was
desolate
whereas
upon
her
the
world
smiled
most
benignly
brooke
had
just
informed
her
that
he
intended
to
make
her
his
wife
as
speedily
as
possible
with
her
aunt
consent
if
possible
but
if
not
then
without
it
he
had
ridiculed
the
idea
of
his
being
stopped
by
miss
stanbury
threats
and
had
said
all
this
in
such
fashion
that
even
priscilla
herself
had
only
listened
and
obeyed
he
had
spoken
not
a
word
of
his
own
income
and
none
of
them
had
dreamed
even
of
asking
him
a
question
he
had
been
as
a
god
in
the
little
cottage
and
all
of
them
had
been
ready
to
fall
down
and
worship
him
stanbury
had
not
known
how
to
treat
him
with
sufficient
deference
and
at
the
same
time
with
sufficient
affection
he
had
kissed
them
all
round
and
priscilla
had
felt
an
elation
which
was
hardly
intelligible
to
herself
dorothy
who
was
so
much
honoured
had
come
to
enjoy
a
status
in
her
mother
estimation
very
different
from
that
which
she
had
previously
possessed
and
had
grown
to
be
quite
beautiful
in
her
mother
eyes
there
was
once
a
family
of
three
ancient
maiden
ladies
much
respected
and
loved
in
the
town
in
which
they
lived
their
manners
of
life
were
well
known
among
their
friends
and
excited
no
surprise
but
a
stranger
to
the
locality
once
asked
of
the
elder
why
miss
matilda
the
younger
always
went
first
out
of
the
room
matilda
once
had
an
offer
of
marriage
said
the
dear
simple
old
lady
who
had
never
been
so
graced
and
who
felt
that
such
an
episode
in
life
was
quite
sufficient
to
bestow
brevet
rank
it
was
believed
by
stanbury
that
dorothy
honours
would
be
carried
further
than
those
of
miss
matilda
but
there
was
much
of
the
same
feeling
in
the
bosom
of
the
mother
towards
the
fortunate
daughter
who
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
had
seemed
goodly
enough
to
be
his
wife
with
this
swelling
happiness
round
her
heart
dorothy
read
her
letter
and
was
infinitely
softened
i
had
gotten
somehow
to
love
to
see
your
pretty
face
dorothy
had
thought
little
enough
of
her
own
beauty
but
she
liked
being
told
by
her
aunt
that
her
face
had
been
found
to
be
pretty
i
am
very
desolate
and
solitary
here
her
aunt
said
and
then
had
come
those
words
about
the
state
of
maiden
women
and
then
those
other
words
about
women
duties
and
her
aunt
prayer
on
her
behalf
dear
dorothy
be
not
such
an
one
she
held
the
letter
to
her
lips
and
to
her
bosom
and
could
hardly
continue
its
perusal
because
of
her
tears
such
prayers
from
the
aged
addressed
to
the
young
are
generally
held
in
light
esteem
but
this
adjuration
was
valued
by
the
girl
to
whom
it
was
addressed
she
put
together
the
invitation
or
rather
the
permission
accorded
to
her
to
make
a
visit
to
exeter
and
the
intimation
in
the
postscript
that
martha
knew
her
mistress
mind
and
then
she
returned
to
the
in
which
martha
was
still
seated
with
her
mother
and
took
the
old
servant
apart
martha
she
said
is
my
aunt
happy
now
well
miss
she
is
strong
again
is
she
not
sir
peter
says
she
is
getting
well
and
martin
but
martin
is
much
account
she
eats
and
drinks
again
pretty
well
not
as
it
used
to
be
you
know
miss
i
tell
her
she
ought
to
go
somewheres
but
she
do
like
moving
nohow
she
never
did
i
tell
her
if
she
go
to
dawlish
just
for
a
week
but
she
do
think
there
a
bed
fit
to
sleep
on
nowhere
except
just
her
own
she
would
go
if
sir
peter
told
her
she
says
that
these
movings
are
newfangled
fashions
and
that
the
air
did
use
to
want
changing
for
folk
when
she
was
young
i
heard
her
tell
sir
peter
herself
that
if
she
could
live
at
exeter
she
would
die
there
she
wo
go
nowheres
miss
dorothy
she
careful
to
live
tell
me
something
martha
will
you
what
is
it
miss
dorothy
be
a
dear
good
woman
now
and
tell
me
true
would
she
be
better
if
i
were
with
her
she
do
like
being
alone
miss
i
do
know
nobody
as
does
but
now
about
brooke
you
know
yes
brooke
that
it
of
course
martha
i
love
him
better
than
anything
in
all
the
world
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
was
but
i
think
i
loved
him
the
very
first
moment
i
saw
him
dear
dear
dear
i
could
help
it
martha
but
it
no
good
talking
about
it
for
of
course
i
sha
try
to
help
it
now
only
this
that
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
my
aunt
except
that
but
she
do
like
it
miss
dorothy
that
is
the
truth
you
know
it
ca
be
helped
now
martha
and
of
course
she
be
told
at
once
shall
i
go
and
tell
her
i
go
if
you
think
she
would
like
it
and
mr
brooke
he
is
to
go
and
will
you
leave
him
here
why
not
nobody
will
hurt
him
i
do
mind
a
bit
about
having
him
with
me
now
but
i
can
tell
you
this
when
he
went
away
from
us
once
it
made
me
very
unhappy
would
aunt
stanbury
be
glad
to
see
me
martha
martha
reserve
was
at
last
broken
down
and
she
expressed
herself
in
strong
language
there
was
nothing
on
earth
her
mistress
wanted
so
much
as
to
have
her
favourite
niece
back
again
martha
acknowledged
that
there
were
great
difficulties
about
brooke
burgess
and
she
did
not
see
her
way
clearly
through
them
dorothy
declared
her
purpose
of
telling
her
aunt
boldly
at
once
martha
shook
her
head
admiring
the
honesty
and
courage
but
doubting
the
result
she
understood
better
than
did
any
one
else
the
peculiarity
of
mind
which
made
her
mistress
specially
anxious
that
none
of
the
stanbury
family
should
enjoy
any
portion
of
the
burgess
money
beyond
that
which
she
herself
had
saved
out
of
the
income
there
had
been
moments
in
which
martha
had
hoped
that
this
prejudice
might
be
overcome
in
favour
of
hugh
but
it
had
become
stronger
as
the
old
woman
grew
to
be
older
and
more
feeble
and
it
was
believed
now
to
be
settled
as
fate
sooner
give
it
all
to
old
barty
over
the
way
martha
had
once
said
than
let
it
go
to
her
own
kith
and
kin
and
if
she
do
hate
any
human
creature
she
do
hate
barty
burgess
she
assented
however
to
dorothy
proposal
and
though
stanbury
and
priscilla
were
astounded
by
the
precipitancy
of
the
measure
they
did
not
attempt
to
oppose
it
and
what
am
i
to
do
said
brooke
when
he
was
told
you
come
of
course
said
dorothy
but
it
may
be
that
the
two
of
us
together
will
be
too
many
for
the
dear
old
lunatic
you
sha
call
her
a
lunatic
brooke
she
is
so
much
a
lunatic
as
you
are
to
run
counter
to
her
and
disobey
her
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
how
about
yourself
how
can
i
help
it
brooke
it
is
you
that
say
it
must
be
so
of
course
it
must
who
is
to
be
stayed
from
doing
what
is
reasonable
because
an
old
woman
has
a
bee
on
her
bonnet
i
do
believe
in
people
wills
she
can
do
what
she
likes
about
it
brooke
of
course
she
can
and
of
course
she
will
what
i
mean
is
that
it
never
pays
to
do
this
or
that
because
somebody
may
alter
his
will
or
may
make
a
will
or
may
not
make
a
will
you
become
a
slave
for
life
and
then
your
dead
tyrant
leaves
you
a
and
grins
at
you
out
of
his
grave
all
the
same
she
kick
up
a
row
i
fancy
and
you
have
to
bear
the
worst
of
it
i
tell
her
the
truth
and
if
she
be
very
angry
i
just
come
home
again
but
i
think
i
come
home
any
way
so
that
i
pass
you
on
the
road
that
will
be
best
she
wo
want
us
both
together
only
then
brooke
i
sha
see
you
again
not
till
june
and
is
it
to
be
really
in
june
you
say
you
do
like
may
you
are
such
a
goose
brooke
it
will
be
may
almost
i
shall
be
such
a
poor
wife
for
you
brooke
as
for
getting
my
things
ready
i
shall
not
bring
hardly
any
things
at
all
have
you
thought
what
it
is
to
take
a
body
so
very
poor
i
own
i
have
thought
as
much
about
it
dolly
as
i
ought
to
have
done
perhaps
it
is
too
late
now
brooke
i
suppose
it
is
quite
too
late
a
week
ago
i
could
have
borne
it
i
had
almost
got
myself
to
think
that
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
bear
it
but
you
have
come
and
banished
all
the
virtue
out
of
my
head
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
because
i
am
so
unworthy
but
i
would
put
up
with
that
shame
rather
than
lose
you
now
brooke
brooke
i
will
so
try
to
be
good
to
you
in
the
afternoon
martha
and
dorothy
started
together
for
exeter
brooke
and
priscilla
accompanying
them
as
far
as
crocket
where
the
lessboro
fly
was
awaiting
them
dorothy
said
little
or
nothing
during
the
walk
nor
indeed
was
she
very
communicative
during
the
journey
into
exeter
she
was
going
to
her
aunt
instigated
simply
by
the
affection
of
her
full
heart
but
she
was
going
with
a
tale
in
her
mouth
which
she
knew
would
be
very
unwelcome
she
could
not
save
herself
from
feeling
that
in
having
accepted
brooke
and
in
having
not
only
accepted
him
but
even
fixed
the
day
for
her
marriage
she
had
been
ungrateful
to
her
aunt
had
it
not
been
for
her
kindness
and
hospitality
she
would
never
have
seen
brooke
burgess
and
as
she
had
been
under
her
aunt
care
at
exeter
she
doubted
whether
she
had
not
been
guilty
of
some
great
fault
in
falling
in
love
with
this
man
in
opposition
as
it
were
to
express
orders
should
her
aunt
still
declare
that
she
would
in
no
way
countenance
the
marriage
that
she
would
still
oppose
it
and
use
her
influence
with
brooke
to
break
it
off
then
would
dorothy
return
on
the
morrow
to
her
mother
cottage
at
nuncombe
putney
so
that
her
lover
might
be
free
to
act
with
her
aunt
as
he
might
think
fit
and
should
he
yield
she
would
endeavour
she
would
struggle
hard
to
think
that
he
was
still
acting
for
the
best
i
must
tell
her
myself
martha
said
dorothy
as
they
came
near
to
exeter
certainly
miss
only
you
do
it
yes
at
once
as
soon
after
i
get
there
as
possible
chapter
lxxiii
dorothy
returns
to
exeter
miss
stanbury
perfectly
understood
that
martha
was
to
come
back
by
the
train
reaching
exeter
at
and
that
she
might
be
expected
in
the
close
about
a
after
that
time
she
had
been
nervous
and
anxious
all
day
so
much
so
that
martin
had
told
her
that
she
must
be
very
careful
that
all
very
well
the
old
woman
had
said
but
you
have
got
any
medicine
for
my
complaint
mr
martin
the
apothecary
had
assured
her
that
the
worst
of
her
complaint
was
in
the
east
wind
and
had
gone
away
begging
her
to
be
very
careful
it
is
not
god
breezes
that
are
hard
to
any
one
the
old
lady
had
said
to
herself
but
our
own
hearts
after
her
lonely
dinner
she
had
fidgeted
about
the
room
and
had
rung
twice
for
the
girl
not
knowing
what
order
to
give
when
the
servant
came
to
her
she
was
very
anxious
about
her
tea
but
would
not
have
it
brought
to
her
till
after
martha
should
have
arrived
she
was
to
order
that
a
second
cup
and
saucer
should
be
placed
there
but
she
had
not
the
courage
to
face
the
disappointment
which
would
fall
upon
her
should
the
cup
and
saucer
stand
there
for
no
purpose
and
yet
should
she
come
how
nice
it
would
be
to
shew
her
girl
that
her
old
aunt
had
been
ready
for
her
thrice
she
went
to
the
window
after
the
cathedral
clock
had
struck
seven
to
see
whether
her
ambassador
was
returning
from
her
window
there
was
only
one
very
short
space
of
pathway
on
which
she
could
have
seen
her
and
as
it
happened
there
came
the
ring
at
the
door
and
no
ambassador
had
as
yet
been
viewed
miss
stanbury
was
immediately
off
her
seat
and
out
upon
the
landing
here
we
are
again
miss
dorothy
said
martha
then
miss
stanbury
could
not
restrain
herself
but
descended
the
stairs
moving
as
she
had
never
moved
since
she
had
first
been
my
bairn
she
said
my
dearest
bairn
i
thought
that
perhaps
it
might
be
so
jane
another
and
saucer
what
a
pity
that
she
had
not
ordered
it
before
and
get
a
hot
cake
jane
you
will
be
ever
so
hungry
my
darling
after
your
journey
are
you
glad
to
see
me
aunt
stanbury
said
dorothy
glad
my
pretty
one
then
she
put
up
her
hands
and
smoothed
down
the
girl
cheeks
and
kissed
her
and
patted
martha
on
the
back
and
scolded
her
at
the
same
time
for
not
bringing
miss
dorothy
from
the
station
in
a
cab
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
little
bag
she
said
you
shall
go
back
for
the
rest
yourself
martha
because
it
is
your
own
fault
martha
knew
that
all
this
was
pleasant
enough
but
then
her
mistress
moods
would
sometimes
be
changed
so
suddenly
how
would
it
be
when
miss
stanbury
knew
that
brooke
burgess
had
been
left
behind
at
nuncombe
putney
you
see
i
did
stay
to
eat
any
of
the
lamb
said
dorothy
smiling
you
shall
have
a
calf
instead
my
dear
said
miss
stanbury
because
you
are
a
returned
prodigal
all
this
was
very
pleasant
and
miss
stanbury
was
so
happy
dispensing
her
tea
and
the
hot
cake
and
the
clotted
cream
and
was
so
intent
upon
her
little
methods
of
caressing
and
petting
her
niece
that
dorothy
had
no
heart
to
tell
her
story
while
the
plates
and
cups
were
still
upon
the
table
she
had
not
perhaps
cared
much
for
the
hot
cake
having
such
a
weight
upon
her
mind
but
she
had
seemed
to
care
understanding
well
that
she
might
so
best
conduce
to
her
comfort
miss
stanbury
was
a
woman
who
could
not
bear
that
the
good
things
which
she
had
provided
for
a
guest
should
not
be
enjoyed
she
could
taste
with
a
friend
palate
and
drink
with
a
friend
throat
but
when
debarred
these
vicarious
pleasures
by
what
seemed
to
her
to
be
the
caprice
of
her
guests
she
would
be
offended
it
had
been
one
of
the
original
sins
of
camilla
and
arabella
french
that
they
would
declare
at
her
that
they
had
dined
late
and
could
not
eat
dorothy
knew
all
this
and
did
her
duty
but
with
a
heavy
heart
there
was
the
story
to
be
told
and
she
had
promised
martha
that
it
should
be
told
she
was
quite
aware
too
independently
of
her
promise
that
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
told
it
was
very
sad
very
grievous
that
the
dear
old
lady
happiness
should
be
disturbed
so
soon
but
it
must
be
done
when
the
were
being
taken
away
her
aunt
was
still
purring
round
her
and
saying
gentle
loving
words
dorothy
bore
it
as
well
as
she
could
bore
it
well
smiling
and
kissing
her
aunt
hand
and
uttering
now
and
then
some
word
of
affection
but
the
thing
had
to
be
done
and
as
soon
as
the
room
was
quiet
for
a
moment
she
jumped
up
from
her
chair
and
began
aunt
stanbury
i
must
tell
you
something
at
once
who
do
you
think
is
at
nuncombe
putney
not
brooke
burgess
yes
he
is
he
is
there
now
and
is
to
be
here
with
you
the
whole
colour
and
character
of
miss
stanbury
face
was
changed
in
a
moment
she
had
been
still
purring
up
to
the
moment
in
which
this
communication
had
been
made
to
her
her
gratification
had
come
to
her
from
the
idea
that
her
pet
had
come
back
to
her
from
love
of
her
as
in
very
truth
had
been
the
case
but
now
it
seemed
that
dorothy
had
returned
to
ask
for
a
great
favour
for
herself
and
she
reflected
at
once
that
brooke
had
passed
through
exeter
without
seeing
her
if
he
was
determined
to
marry
without
reference
to
her
he
might
at
any
rate
have
had
the
grace
to
come
to
her
and
say
so
she
in
the
fulness
of
her
heart
had
written
words
of
affection
to
dorothy
and
both
dorothy
and
brooke
had
at
once
taken
advantage
of
her
expressions
for
their
own
purposes
such
was
her
reading
of
the
story
of
the
day
he
need
not
trouble
himself
to
come
here
now
she
said
dear
aunt
do
not
say
that
i
do
say
it
he
need
not
trouble
himself
to
come
now
when
i
said
that
i
should
be
glad
to
see
you
i
did
not
intend
that
you
should
meet
burgess
under
my
roof
i
did
not
wish
to
have
you
both
together
how
could
i
help
coming
when
you
wrote
to
me
like
that
it
is
very
well
but
he
need
not
come
he
knows
the
way
from
nuncombe
to
london
without
stopping
at
exeter
aunt
stanbury
you
must
let
me
tell
it
you
all
there
is
no
more
to
tell
i
should
think
but
there
is
more
you
knew
what
he
thought
about
me
and
what
he
wished
he
is
his
own
master
my
dear
and
you
are
your
own
mistress
if
you
speak
to
me
like
that
you
will
kill
me
aunt
stanbury
i
did
not
think
of
coming
only
when
martha
brought
your
dear
letter
i
could
not
help
it
but
he
was
coming
he
meant
to
come
and
he
will
of
course
he
must
defend
himself
if
you
are
angry
with
him
he
need
not
defend
himself
at
all
i
told
them
and
i
told
him
that
i
would
only
stay
one
night
if
you
did
not
wish
that
we
should
be
here
together
you
must
see
him
aunt
stanbury
you
would
not
refuse
to
see
him
if
you
please
my
dear
you
must
allow
me
to
judge
whom
i
will
see
after
that
the
discussion
ceased
between
them
for
awhile
and
miss
stanbury
left
the
room
that
she
might
hold
a
consultation
with
martha
dorothy
went
up
to
her
chamber
and
saw
that
everything
had
been
prepared
for
her
with
most
scrupulous
care
nothing
could
be
whiter
neater
cleaner
nicer
than
was
everything
that
surrounded
her
she
had
perceived
while
living
under
her
aunt
roof
how
gradually
small
delicate
feminine
comforts
had
been
increased
for
her
martha
had
been
told
that
miss
dorothy
ought
to
have
this
and
that
miss
dorothy
ought
to
have
that
till
at
last
she
who
had
hitherto
known
nothing
of
the
small
luxuries
that
come
from
an
easy
income
had
felt
ashamed
of
the
prettinesses
that
had
been
added
to
her
now
she
could
see
at
once
that
infinite
care
had
been
used
to
make
her
room
bright
and
smiling
only
in
the
hope
that
she
would
return
as
soon
as
she
saw
it
all
she
sat
down
on
her
bed
and
burst
out
into
tears
was
it
not
hard
upon
her
that
she
should
be
forced
into
such
ingratitude
every
comfort
prepared
for
her
was
a
coal
of
hot
fire
upon
her
head
and
yet
what
had
she
done
that
she
ought
not
to
have
done
was
it
unreasonable
that
she
should
have
loved
this
man
when
they
two
were
brought
together
and
had
she
even
dared
to
think
of
him
otherwise
than
as
an
acquaintance
till
he
had
compelled
her
to
confess
her
love
and
after
that
had
she
not
tried
to
separate
herself
from
him
so
that
they
two
her
aunt
and
her
lover
might
be
divided
by
no
quarrel
had
not
priscilla
told
her
that
she
was
right
in
all
that
she
was
doing
nevertheless
in
spite
of
all
this
she
could
not
refrain
from
accusing
herself
of
ingratitude
towards
her
aunt
and
she
began
to
think
it
would
have
been
better
for
her
now
to
have
remained
at
home
and
have
allowed
brooke
to
come
alone
to
exeter
than
to
have
obeyed
the
impulse
which
had
arisen
from
the
receipt
of
her
aunt
letter
when
she
went
down
again
she
found
herself
alone
in
the
room
and
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
it
was
intended
that
she
should
go
to
bed
without
again
seeing
her
aunt
but
at
last
miss
stanbury
came
to
her
with
a
sad
countenance
but
without
that
look
of
wrath
which
dorothy
knew
so
well
my
dear
she
said
it
will
be
better
that
burgess
should
go
up
to
london
i
will
see
him
of
course
if
he
chooses
to
come
and
martha
shall
meet
him
at
the
station
and
explain
it
if
you
do
not
mind
i
would
prefer
that
you
should
not
meet
him
here
i
meant
only
to
stay
one
night
aunt
that
is
nonsense
if
i
am
to
part
with
either
of
you
i
will
part
with
him
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
he
is
dorothy
you
do
not
know
how
dear
to
me
you
are
dorothy
immediately
fell
on
her
knees
at
her
aunt
feet
and
hid
her
face
in
her
aunt
lap
miss
stanbury
twined
round
her
fingers
the
soft
hair
which
she
loved
so
well
because
it
was
a
grace
given
by
god
and
not
bought
out
of
a
shop
and
caressed
the
girl
head
and
muttered
something
that
was
intended
for
a
prayer
if
he
will
let
me
aunt
i
will
give
him
up
said
dorothy
looking
up
into
her
aunt
face
if
he
will
say
that
i
may
though
i
shall
love
him
always
he
may
go
he
is
his
own
master
said
miss
stanbury
of
course
he
is
his
own
master
will
you
let
me
return
just
for
a
few
days
and
then
you
can
talk
to
him
as
you
please
i
did
not
mean
to
come
to
stay
i
wished
him
because
i
knew
that
i
should
not
meet
him
here
you
always
talk
of
going
away
dorothy
as
soon
as
ever
you
are
in
the
house
you
are
always
threatening
me
i
will
come
again
the
moment
you
tell
me
if
he
goes
in
the
morning
i
will
be
here
the
same
evening
and
i
will
write
to
him
aunt
stanbury
and
tell
him
that
he
is
quite
free
quite
free
quite
free
miss
stanbury
made
no
reply
to
this
but
sat
still
playing
with
her
niece
hair
i
think
i
will
go
to
bed
she
said
at
last
it
is
past
ten
you
need
not
go
to
nuncombe
dorothy
martha
shall
meet
him
and
he
can
see
me
here
but
i
do
not
wish
him
to
stay
in
the
house
you
can
go
over
and
call
on
machugh
machugh
will
take
it
well
of
you
that
you
should
call
on
her
dorothy
made
no
further
opposition
to
this
arrangement
but
kissed
her
aunt
and
went
to
her
chamber
how
was
it
all
to
be
for
her
for
the
last
two
days
she
had
been
radiant
with
new
happiness
everything
had
seemed
to
be
settled
her
lover
in
his
way
had
declared
that
in
no
important
crisis
of
life
would
he
allow
himself
to
be
driven
out
of
his
way
by
the
fear
of
what
an
old
woman
might
do
in
her
will
when
dorothy
assured
him
that
not
for
worlds
would
she
though
she
loved
him
dearly
injure
his
material
prospects
he
had
thrown
it
all
aside
after
a
grand
fashion
that
had
really
made
the
girl
think
that
all
miss
stanbury
money
was
as
nothing
to
his
love
for
her
she
and
priscilla
and
her
mother
had
been
carried
away
so
entirely
by
brooke
oratory
as
to
feel
for
the
time
that
the
difficulties
were
entirely
conquered
but
now
the
aspect
of
things
was
so
different
whatever
brooke
might
owe
to
miss
stanbury
she
dorothy
owed
her
aunt
everything
she
would
immolate
herself
if
brooke
would
only
let
her
she
did
not
quite
understand
her
aunt
stubborn
opposition
but
she
knew
that
there
was
some
great
cause
for
her
aunt
feeling
on
the
matter
there
had
been
a
promise
made
or
an
oath
sworn
that
the
property
of
the
burgess
family
should
not
go
into
the
hands
of
any
stanbury
dorothy
told
herself
that
were
she
married
she
would
be
a
stanbury
no
longer
that
her
aunt
would
still
comply
with
the
obligation
she
had
fixed
for
herself
but
nevertheless
she
was
ready
to
believe
that
her
aunt
might
be
right
her
aunt
had
always
declared
that
it
should
be
so
and
dorothy
knowing
this
confessed
to
herself
that
she
should
have
kept
her
heart
under
better
control
thinking
of
these
things
she
went
to
the
table
where
paper
and
ink
and
pens
had
all
been
prepared
for
her
so
prettily
and
began
her
letter
to
brooke
dearest
dearest
brooke
but
then
she
thought
that
this
was
not
a
fair
keeping
of
her
promise
and
she
began
again
my
dear
brooke
the
letter
however
did
not
get
itself
written
that
night
it
was
almost
impossible
for
her
to
write
it
i
think
it
will
be
better
for
you
she
had
tried
to
say
to
be
guided
by
my
aunt
but
how
could
she
say
this
when
she
did
not
believe
it
it
was
her
wish
to
make
him
understand
that
she
would
never
think
ill
of
him
for
a
moment
if
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
abandon
her
but
she
could
not
find
the
words
to
express
herself
and
she
went
at
last
to
bed
leaving
the
paper
upon
the
table
she
went
to
bed
and
cried
herself
to
sleep
it
had
been
so
sweet
to
have
a
lover
a
man
of
her
own
to
whom
she
could
say
what
she
pleased
from
whom
she
had
a
right
to
ask
for
counsel
and
protection
a
man
who
delighted
to
be
near
her
and
to
make
much
of
her
in
comparison
with
her
old
mode
of
living
her
old
ideas
of
life
her
life
with
such
a
lover
was
passed
in
an
elysium
she
had
entered
from
barren
lands
into
so
rich
a
paradise
but
there
is
no
paradise
as
she
now
found
without
apples
which
must
be
eaten
and
which
lead
to
sorrow
she
regretted
in
this
hour
that
she
had
ever
seen
brooke
burgess
after
all
with
her
aunt
love
and
care
for
her
with
her
mother
and
sister
near
her
with
the
respect
of
those
who
knew
her
why
should
the
lands
have
been
barren
even
had
there
been
no
entrance
for
her
into
that
elysium
and
did
it
not
all
result
in
this
that
the
elysium
to
be
desired
should
not
be
here
that
the
paradise
without
the
apples
must
be
waited
for
till
beyond
the
grave
it
is
when
things
go
badly
with
us
here
and
for
most
of
us
only
then
that
we
think
that
we
can
see
through
the
dark
clouds
into
the
joys
of
heaven
but
at
last
she
slept
and
in
her
dreams
brooke
was
sitting
with
her
in
niddon
park
with
his
arm
tight
clasped
round
her
waist
she
slept
so
soundly
that
when
a
step
crept
silently
into
her
room
and
when
a
light
was
held
for
awhile
over
her
face
neither
the
step
nor
the
light
awakened
her
she
was
lying
with
her
head
back
upon
the
pillow
and
her
arm
hung
by
the
bedside
and
her
lips
were
open
and
her
loose
hair
was
spread
upon
the
pillow
the
person
who
stood
there
with
the
light
thought
that
there
never
had
been
a
fairer
sight
everything
there
was
so
pure
so
sweet
so
good
she
was
one
whose
only
selfish
happiness
could
come
to
her
from
the
belief
that
others
loved
her
the
step
had
been
very
soft
and
even
the
breath
of
the
intruder
was
not
allowed
to
pass
heavily
into
the
air
but
the
light
of
the
candle
shone
upon
the
eyelids
of
the
sleeper
and
she
moved
her
head
restlessly
on
the
pillow
dorothy
are
you
awake
can
you
speak
to
me
then
the
disturbed
girl
gradually
opened
her
eyes
and
gazed
upwards
and
raised
herself
in
her
bed
and
sat
wondering
is
anything
the
matter
aunt
she
said
only
the
vagaries
of
an
old
woman
my
pet
of
an
old
woman
who
can
not
sleep
in
her
bed
illustration
only
the
vagaries
of
an
old
woman
but
what
is
it
aunt
kiss
me
dearest
then
with
something
of
slumber
still
about
her
dorothy
raised
herself
in
her
bed
and
placed
her
arm
on
her
shoulder
and
embraced
her
and
now
for
my
news
said
miss
stanbury
what
news
aunt
it
is
morning
yet
is
it
no
it
is
not
morning
you
shall
sleep
again
presently
i
have
thought
of
it
and
you
shall
be
brooke
wife
and
i
will
have
it
here
and
we
will
all
be
friends
what
you
will
like
that
will
you
not
and
you
will
not
quarrel
with
him
what
am
i
to
say
what
am
i
to
do
she
was
in
truth
awake
now
and
not
knowing
what
she
did
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
stood
holding
her
aunt
by
the
arm
it
is
not
a
dream
said
miss
stanbury
are
you
sure
that
it
is
not
a
dream
and
may
he
come
here
of
course
he
will
come
and
may
i
see
him
aunt
stanbury
not
if
you
go
home
my
dear
but
i
wo
go
home
and
will
you
tell
him
oh
dear
oh
dear
aunt
stanbury
i
do
not
think
that
i
believe
it
yet
you
will
catch
cold
my
dear
if
you
stay
there
trying
to
believe
it
you
have
nothing
on
get
into
bed
and
believe
it
there
you
will
have
time
to
think
of
it
before
the
morning
then
miss
stanbury
went
back
to
her
own
chamber
and
dorothy
was
left
alone
to
realise
her
bliss
she
thought
of
all
her
life
for
the
last
twelve
months
of
the
first
invitation
to
exeter
and
the
doubts
of
the
family
as
to
its
acceptance
of
her
arrival
and
of
her
own
doubts
as
to
the
possibility
of
her
remaining
of
gibson
courtship
and
her
aunt
disappointment
of
brooke
coming
of
her
love
and
of
his
and
then
of
her
departure
back
to
nuncombe
after
that
had
come
the
triumph
of
brooke
visit
and
then
the
terrible
sadness
of
her
aunt
displeasure
but
now
everything
was
good
and
glorious
she
did
not
care
for
money
herself
she
thought
that
she
never
could
care
much
for
being
rich
but
had
she
made
brooke
poor
by
marrying
him
that
must
always
have
been
to
her
matter
of
regret
if
not
of
remorse
but
now
it
was
all
to
be
smooth
and
sweet
now
a
paradise
was
to
be
opened
to
her
with
no
apples
which
she
might
not
eat
no
apples
which
might
not
but
still
must
be
eaten
she
thought
that
it
would
be
impossible
that
she
should
sleep
again
that
night
but
she
did
sleep
and
dreamed
that
brooke
was
holding
her
in
niddon
park
tighter
than
ever
when
the
morning
came
she
trembled
as
she
walked
down
into
the
parlour
might
it
not
still
be
possible
that
it
was
all
a
dream
or
what
if
her
aunt
should
again
have
changed
her
purpose
but
the
first
moment
of
her
aunt
presence
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
how
did
you
sleep
dorothy
said
the
old
lady
dear
aunt
i
do
not
know
was
it
all
sleep
what
shall
we
say
to
brooke
when
he
comes
you
shall
tell
him
no
dearest
you
must
tell
him
and
you
must
say
to
him
that
if
he
is
not
good
to
my
girl
and
does
not
love
her
always
and
cling
to
her
and
keep
her
from
harm
and
be
in
truth
her
loving
husband
i
will
hold
him
to
be
the
most
ungrateful
of
human
beings
and
before
brooke
came
she
spoke
again
i
wonder
whether
he
thinks
you
as
pretty
as
i
do
dolly
he
never
said
that
he
thought
me
pretty
at
all
did
he
not
then
he
shall
say
so
or
he
shall
not
have
you
it
was
your
looks
won
me
first
dolly
like
an
old
fool
as
i
am
it
is
so
pleasant
to
have
a
little
nature
after
such
a
deal
of
artifice
in
which
latter
remarks
it
was
quite
understood
that
miss
stanbury
was
alluding
to
her
enemies
at
heavitree
chapter
lxxiv
the
lioness
aroused
brooke
burgess
had
been
to
exeter
and
had
gone
for
he
only
remained
there
one
night
and
everything
was
apparently
settled
it
was
not
exactly
told
through
exeter
that
miss
stanbury
heir
was
to
be
allowed
to
marry
miss
stanbury
niece
but
martha
knew
it
and
giles
hickbody
guessed
it
and
dorothy
was
allowed
to
tell
her
mother
and
sister
and
brooke
himself
in
his
own
careless
way
had
mentioned
the
matter
to
his
uncle
barty
as
miss
stanbury
had
also
told
the
secret
in
confidence
to
machugh
it
can
not
be
said
that
it
was
altogether
well
kept
four
days
after
brooke
departure
the
news
reached
the
frenches
at
heavitree
it
was
whispered
to
camilla
by
one
of
the
shopmen
with
whom
she
was
still
arranging
her
marriage
trousseau
and
was
repeated
by
her
to
her
mother
and
sister
with
some
additions
which
were
not
intended
to
be
he
gets
her
and
the
money
together
as
a
bargain
of
course
said
camilla
i
only
hope
the
money
wo
be
found
too
dear
perhaps
he
wo
get
it
after
all
said
arabella
that
would
be
cruel
replied
camilla
i
do
think
that
even
miss
stanbury
is
so
false
as
that
things
were
going
very
badly
at
heavitree
there
was
war
there
almost
everlastingly
though
such
little
playful
conversations
as
the
above
shewed
that
there
might
be
an
occasional
lull
in
the
battle
gibson
was
not
doing
his
duty
that
was
clear
enough
even
french
when
she
was
appealed
to
with
almost
frantic
energy
by
her
younger
daughter
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
he
was
very
remiss
as
a
lover
and
camilla
in
her
fury
was
very
imprudent
that
very
frantic
energy
which
induced
her
to
appeal
to
her
mother
was
in
itself
proof
of
her
imprudence
she
knew
that
she
was
foolish
but
she
could
not
control
her
passion
twice
had
she
detected
arabella
in
receiving
notes
from
gibson
which
she
did
not
see
and
of
which
it
had
been
intended
that
she
should
know
nothing
and
once
when
she
spent
a
night
away
at
ottery
mary
with
a
friend
a
visit
which
was
specially
prefatory
to
marriage
and
made
in
reference
to
bridesmaids
dresses
arabella
had
had
so
at
least
camilla
was
made
to
believe
a
secret
meeting
with
gibson
in
some
of
the
lanes
which
lead
down
from
heavitree
to
the
topsham
road
i
happened
to
meet
him
and
spoke
two
words
to
him
said
arabella
would
you
have
me
cut
him
i
tell
you
what
it
is
bella
if
there
is
any
underhand
game
going
on
that
i
do
understand
all
exeter
shall
be
on
fire
before
you
shall
carry
it
out
bella
made
no
answer
to
this
but
shrugged
her
shoulders
camilla
was
almost
at
a
loss
to
guess
what
might
be
the
truth
would
not
any
sister
so
accused
on
such
an
occasion
rebut
the
accusation
with
awful
wrath
but
arabella
simply
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
went
her
way
it
was
now
the
of
april
and
there
wanted
but
one
short
fortnight
to
their
marriage
the
man
had
not
the
courage
to
jilt
her
she
felt
sure
that
he
had
not
heart
enough
to
do
a
deed
of
such
audacity
and
her
sister
too
was
weak
and
a
coward
and
would
lack
the
power
to
stand
on
her
legs
and
declare
herself
to
be
the
perpetrator
of
such
villany
her
mother
as
she
knew
well
would
always
have
preferred
that
her
elder
daughter
should
be
the
bride
but
her
mother
was
not
the
woman
to
have
the
hardihood
now
in
the
eleventh
hour
to
favour
such
an
intrigue
let
her
wish
be
what
it
might
she
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
carry
through
the
accomplishment
of
it
they
would
all
know
that
that
threat
of
hers
of
setting
exeter
on
fire
would
be
carried
out
after
some
fashion
that
would
not
be
inadequate
to
the
occasion
a
sister
a
mother
a
promised
lover
all
false
all
so
damnably
cruelly
false
it
was
impossible
no
history
no
novel
of
most
sensational
interest
no
wonderful
villany
that
had
ever
been
wrought
into
prose
or
poetry
would
have
been
equal
to
this
it
was
impossible
she
told
herself
so
a
score
of
times
a
day
and
yet
the
circumstances
were
so
terribly
suspicious
gibson
conduct
as
a
lover
was
simply
disgraceful
to
him
as
a
man
and
a
clergyman
he
was
full
of
excuses
which
she
knew
to
be
false
he
would
never
come
near
her
if
he
could
help
it
when
he
was
with
her
he
was
as
cold
as
an
archbishop
both
in
word
and
in
action
nothing
would
tempt
him
to
any
outward
manifestation
of
affection
he
would
talk
of
nothing
but
the
poor
women
of
in
the
city
and
the
fraudulent
idleness
of
a
certain
colleague
in
the
cathedral
services
who
was
always
shirking
his
work
he
made
her
no
presents
he
never
walked
with
her
he
was
always
gloomy
and
he
had
indeed
so
behaved
himself
in
public
that
people
were
beginning
to
talk
of
poor
mr
gibson
and
yet
he
could
meet
arabella
on
the
sly
in
the
lanes
and
send
notes
to
her
by
the
boy
poor
gibson
indeed
let
her
once
get
him
well
over
the
of
april
and
the
people
of
exeter
might
talk
about
poor
gibson
if
they
pleased
and
bella
conduct
was
more
wonderful
almost
than
that
of
gibson
with
all
her
cowardice
she
still
held
up
her
head
held
it
perhaps
a
little
higher
than
was
usual
with
her
and
when
that
grievous
accusation
was
made
against
her
made
and
repeated
an
accusation
the
very
thought
and
sound
of
which
would
almost
have
annihilated
her
had
there
been
a
decent
feeling
in
her
bosom
she
would
simply
shrug
her
shoulders
and
walk
away
camilla
she
had
once
said
you
will
drive
that
man
mad
before
you
have
done
what
is
it
to
you
how
i
drive
him
camilla
had
answered
in
her
fury
then
arabella
had
again
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
walked
away
between
camilla
and
her
mother
too
there
had
come
to
be
an
almost
internecine
quarrel
on
a
collateral
point
camilla
was
still
carrying
on
a
vast
arrangement
which
she
called
the
preparation
of
her
trousseau
but
which
both
french
and
bella
regarded
as
a
spoliation
of
the
domestic
nest
for
the
proud
purposes
of
one
of
the
younger
birds
and
this
had
grown
so
fearfully
that
in
two
different
places
french
had
found
herself
compelled
to
request
that
no
further
articles
might
be
supplied
to
miss
camilla
the
bride
elect
had
rebelled
alleging
that
as
no
fortune
was
to
be
provided
for
her
she
had
a
right
to
take
with
her
such
things
as
she
could
carry
away
in
her
trunks
and
boxes
money
could
be
had
at
the
bank
she
said
and
after
all
what
were
fifty
pounds
more
or
less
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
and
then
she
went
into
a
calculation
to
prove
that
her
mother
and
sister
would
be
made
so
much
richer
by
her
absence
and
that
she
was
doing
so
much
for
them
by
her
marriage
that
nothing
could
be
more
mean
in
them
than
that
they
should
hesitate
to
supply
her
with
such
things
as
she
desired
to
make
her
entrance
into
gibson
house
respectable
but
french
was
obdurate
and
gibson
was
desired
to
speak
to
her
gibson
in
fear
and
trembling
told
her
that
she
ought
to
repress
her
spirit
of
extravagance
and
camilla
at
once
foresaw
that
he
would
avail
himself
of
this
plea
against
her
should
he
find
it
possible
at
any
time
to
avail
himself
of
any
plea
she
became
ferocious
and
turning
upon
him
told
him
to
mind
his
own
business
was
it
not
all
for
him
that
she
was
doing
it
she
was
not
she
said
disposed
to
submit
to
any
control
in
such
matters
from
him
till
he
had
assumed
his
legal
right
to
it
by
standing
with
her
before
the
altar
it
came
however
to
be
known
all
over
exeter
that
miss
camilla
expenditure
had
been
checked
and
that
in
spite
of
the
joys
naturally
incidental
to
a
wedding
things
were
not
going
well
with
the
ladies
at
heavitree
at
last
the
blow
came
camilla
was
aware
that
on
a
certain
morning
her
mother
had
been
to
gibson
house
and
had
held
a
long
conference
with
him
she
could
learn
nothing
of
what
took
place
there
for
at
that
moment
she
had
taken
upon
herself
to
place
herself
on
terms
with
her
mother
in
consequence
of
those
disgraceful
orders
which
had
been
given
to
the
tradesmen
but
bella
had
not
been
at
gibson
house
at
the
time
and
camilla
though
she
presumed
that
her
own
conduct
had
been
discussed
in
a
manner
very
injurious
to
herself
did
not
believe
that
any
step
was
being
then
arranged
which
would
be
positively
antagonistic
to
her
own
views
the
day
fixed
was
now
so
very
near
that
there
could
she
felt
be
no
escape
for
the
victim
but
she
was
wrong
gibson
had
been
found
by
french
in
a
very
excited
state
on
that
occasion
he
had
wept
and
pulled
his
hair
and
torn
open
his
waistcoat
had
spoken
of
himself
as
a
wretch
pleading
however
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
had
paced
about
the
room
with
his
hands
dashing
against
his
brows
and
at
last
had
flung
himself
prostrate
on
the
ground
the
meaning
of
it
all
was
that
he
had
tried
very
hard
and
had
found
at
last
that
he
could
do
it
i
am
ready
to
submit
said
he
to
any
verdict
that
you
may
pronounce
against
me
but
i
should
deceive
you
and
deceive
her
if
i
did
say
at
once
that
i
ca
do
it
he
went
on
to
explain
that
since
he
had
unfortunately
entered
into
his
present
engagement
with
camilla
of
whose
position
he
spoke
in
quite
a
touching
manner
and
since
he
had
found
what
was
the
condition
of
his
own
heart
and
feelings
he
had
consulted
a
friend
who
if
any
merely
human
being
was
capable
of
advising
might
be
implicitly
trusted
for
advice
in
such
a
matter
and
that
his
friend
had
told
him
that
he
was
bound
to
give
up
the
marriage
let
the
consequences
to
himself
or
to
others
be
what
they
might
although
the
skies
should
fall
on
me
i
can
not
stand
at
the
hymeneal
altar
with
a
lie
in
my
mouth
said
gibson
immediately
upon
his
rising
from
his
prostrate
condition
on
the
floor
in
such
a
position
as
this
a
mother
fury
would
surely
be
very
great
but
french
was
hardly
furious
she
cried
and
begged
him
to
think
better
of
it
and
assured
him
that
camilla
when
she
should
be
calmed
down
by
matrimony
would
not
be
so
bad
as
she
seemed
but
she
was
not
furious
the
truth
is
gibson
she
said
through
her
tears
that
after
all
you
like
bella
best
gibson
owned
that
he
did
like
bella
best
and
although
no
bargain
was
made
between
them
then
and
there
and
such
making
of
a
bargain
then
and
there
would
hardly
have
been
practicable
it
was
understood
that
french
would
not
proceed
to
extremities
if
gibson
would
still
make
himself
forthcoming
as
a
husband
for
the
advantage
of
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
family
so
far
gibson
had
progressed
towards
a
partial
liberation
from
his
thraldom
with
a
considerable
amount
of
courage
but
he
was
well
aware
that
the
great
act
of
daring
still
remained
to
be
done
he
had
suggested
to
french
that
she
should
settle
the
matter
with
camilla
but
this
french
had
altogether
declined
to
do
it
must
she
said
come
from
himself
if
she
were
to
do
it
she
must
sympathise
with
her
child
and
such
sympathy
would
be
obstructive
of
the
future
arrangements
which
were
still
to
be
made
she
always
knew
that
i
liked
bella
best
said
gibson
still
sobbing
still
tearing
his
hair
still
pacing
the
room
with
his
waistcoat
torn
open
i
would
not
advise
you
to
tell
her
that
said
french
then
french
went
home
and
early
on
the
following
morning
it
was
thought
good
by
arabella
that
she
also
should
pay
a
visit
at
ottery
mary
cammy
said
arabella
as
she
went
bella
said
camilla
i
wonder
whether
you
are
a
serpent
i
do
not
think
you
can
be
so
base
a
serpent
as
that
i
declare
cammy
you
do
say
such
odd
things
that
no
one
can
understand
what
you
mean
and
so
she
went
on
that
morning
gibson
was
walking
at
an
early
hour
along
the
road
from
exeter
to
cowley
contemplating
his
position
and
striving
to
arrange
his
plans
what
was
he
to
do
and
how
was
he
to
do
it
he
was
prepared
to
throw
up
his
living
to
abandon
the
cathedral
to
leave
the
diocese
to
make
any
sacrifice
rather
than
take
camilla
to
his
bosom
within
the
last
six
weeks
he
had
learned
to
regard
her
with
almost
a
holy
horror
he
could
not
understand
by
what
miracle
of
he
had
fallen
into
so
perilous
an
abyss
he
had
long
known
camilla
temper
but
in
those
days
in
which
he
had
been
beaten
like
a
shuttlecock
between
the
stanburys
and
the
frenches
he
had
lost
his
head
and
had
done
he
knew
not
what
those
whom
the
god
chooses
to
destroy
he
first
maddens
said
gibson
to
himself
of
himself
throwing
himself
back
upon
early
erudition
and
pagan
philosophy
then
he
looked
across
to
the
river
exe
and
thought
that
there
was
hardly
water
enough
there
to
cover
the
multiplicity
of
his
sorrows
but
something
must
be
done
he
had
proceeded
so
far
in
forming
a
resolution
as
he
reached
david
church
on
his
return
homewards
his
sagacious
friend
had
told
him
that
as
soon
as
he
had
altered
his
mind
he
was
bound
to
let
the
lady
know
of
it
without
delay
you
must
remember
said
the
sagacious
friend
that
you
will
owe
her
much
very
much
gibson
was
perplexed
in
his
mind
when
he
reflected
how
much
he
might
possibly
be
made
to
owe
her
if
she
should
decide
on
appealing
to
a
jury
of
her
countrymen
for
justice
but
anything
would
be
better
than
his
home
at
with
camilla
sitting
opposite
to
him
as
his
wife
were
there
not
distant
lands
in
which
a
clergyman
unfortunate
but
still
energetic
might
find
work
to
do
was
there
not
all
america
and
were
there
not
australia
new
zealand
natal
all
open
to
him
would
not
a
missionary
career
among
the
chinese
be
better
for
him
than
with
camilla
french
for
his
wife
by
the
time
he
had
reached
home
his
mind
was
made
up
he
would
write
a
letter
to
camilla
at
once
and
he
would
marry
arabella
at
once
on
any
day
that
might
be
fixed
on
condition
that
camilla
would
submit
to
her
defeat
without
legal
redress
if
legal
redress
should
be
demanded
he
would
put
in
evidence
the
fact
that
her
own
mother
had
been
compelled
to
caution
the
tradesmen
of
the
city
in
regard
to
her
extravagance
he
did
write
his
letter
in
an
agony
of
spirit
i
sit
down
camilla
with
a
sad
heart
and
a
reluctant
hand
he
said
to
communicate
to
you
a
fatal
truth
but
truth
should
be
made
to
prevail
and
there
is
nothing
in
man
so
cowardly
so
detrimental
and
so
unmanly
as
its
concealment
i
have
looked
into
myself
and
have
inquired
of
myself
and
have
assured
myself
that
were
i
to
become
your
husband
i
should
not
make
you
happy
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
me
now
to
dilate
on
the
reasons
which
have
convinced
me
but
i
am
convinced
and
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
inform
you
so
at
once
i
have
been
closeted
with
your
mother
and
have
made
her
understand
that
it
is
so
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
in
my
own
justification
but
this
that
i
am
sure
i
am
acting
honestly
in
telling
you
the
truth
i
would
not
wish
to
say
a
word
animadverting
on
yourself
if
there
must
be
blame
in
this
matter
i
am
willing
to
take
it
all
on
my
own
shoulders
but
things
have
been
done
of
late
and
words
have
been
spoken
and
habits
have
displayed
themselves
which
would
not
i
am
sure
conduce
to
our
mutual
comfort
in
this
world
or
to
our
assistance
to
each
other
in
our
struggles
to
reach
the
happiness
of
the
world
to
come
i
think
that
you
will
agree
with
me
camilla
that
when
a
man
or
a
woman
has
fallen
into
such
a
mistake
as
that
which
i
have
now
made
it
is
best
that
it
should
be
acknowledged
i
know
well
that
such
a
change
of
arrangements
as
that
which
i
now
propose
will
be
regarded
most
unfavourably
but
will
not
anything
be
better
than
the
binding
of
a
matrimonial
knot
which
can
not
be
again
unloosed
and
which
we
should
both
regret
i
do
not
know
that
i
need
add
anything
further
what
can
i
add
further
only
this
that
i
am
inflexible
having
resolved
to
take
this
step
and
to
bear
the
evil
things
that
may
be
said
of
me
for
your
happiness
and
for
my
own
tranquility
i
shall
not
now
relinquish
my
resolution
i
do
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
i
doubt
much
whether
i
shall
ever
be
quite
able
to
forgive
myself
the
mistake
which
i
have
made
is
one
which
should
not
have
been
committed
i
do
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
but
i
do
ask
you
to
pray
that
i
may
be
forgiven
yours
with
feelings
of
the
truest
friendship
thomas
gibson
the
letter
had
been
very
difficult
but
he
was
rather
proud
of
it
than
otherwise
when
it
was
completed
he
had
felt
that
he
was
writing
a
letter
which
not
improbably
might
become
public
property
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
firm
that
he
should
accuse
himself
a
little
in
order
that
he
might
excuse
himself
much
and
that
he
should
hint
at
causes
which
might
justify
the
rupture
though
he
should
so
veil
them
as
not
to
appear
to
defend
his
own
delinquency
by
ungenerous
when
he
had
completed
the
letter
he
thought
that
he
had
done
all
this
rather
well
and
he
sent
the
despatch
off
to
heavitree
by
the
clerk
of
peter
church
with
something
of
that
feeling
of
expressible
relief
which
attends
the
final
conquest
over
some
fatal
and
all
but
insuperable
misfortune
he
thought
that
he
was
sure
now
that
he
would
not
have
to
marry
camilla
on
the
of
the
month
and
there
would
probably
be
a
period
of
some
hours
before
he
would
be
called
upon
to
hear
or
read
reply
camilla
was
alone
when
she
received
the
letter
but
she
rushed
at
once
to
her
mother
there
said
she
there
i
knew
that
it
was
coming
french
took
the
paper
into
her
hands
and
gasped
and
gazed
at
her
daughter
without
speaking
you
knew
of
it
mother
yesterday
when
he
told
me
i
knew
of
it
and
bella
knows
it
not
a
word
of
it
she
does
i
am
sure
she
does
but
it
is
all
nothing
i
will
not
accept
it
he
can
not
treat
me
so
i
will
drag
him
there
but
he
shall
come
you
ca
make
him
my
dear
i
will
make
him
and
you
would
help
me
mamma
if
you
had
any
spirit
what
a
fortnight
before
the
time
when
the
things
are
all
bought
look
at
the
presents
that
have
been
sent
mamma
he
know
me
and
he
never
would
have
done
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
bella
never
she
had
better
take
care
or
there
shall
be
such
a
tragedy
that
nobody
ever
heard
the
like
if
she
thinks
that
she
is
going
to
be
that
man
wife
she
is
mistaken
then
there
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
mamma
she
said
i
shall
go
to
him
at
once
i
do
not
care
in
the
least
what
anybody
may
say
i
shall
go
to
him
at
once
french
felt
that
at
this
moment
it
was
best
that
she
should
be
silent

illustration
by
the
thirteenth
of
may
the
rowley
family
had
established
itself
in
florence
purposing
to
remain
either
there
or
at
the
baths
of
lucca
till
the
end
of
june
at
which
time
it
was
thought
that
sir
marmaduke
should
begin
to
make
preparations
for
his
journey
back
to
the
islands
their
future
prospects
were
not
altogether
settled
it
was
not
decided
whether
lady
rowley
should
at
once
return
with
him
whether
trevelyan
should
return
with
him
nor
was
it
settled
among
them
what
should
be
the
fate
of
nora
rowley
nora
rowley
was
quite
resolved
herself
that
she
would
not
go
back
to
the
islands
and
had
said
as
much
to
her
mother
lady
rowley
had
not
repeated
this
to
sir
marmaduke
and
was
herself
in
doubt
as
to
what
might
best
be
done
girls
are
understood
by
their
mothers
better
than
they
are
by
their
fathers
lady
rowley
was
beginning
to
be
aware
that
obstinacy
was
too
strong
to
be
overcome
by
mere
words
and
that
other
steps
must
be
taken
if
she
were
to
be
weaned
from
her
pernicious
passion
for
hugh
stanbury
glascock
was
still
in
florence
might
she
not
be
cured
by
further
overtures
from
glascock
the
chance
of
securing
such
a
was
so
important
so
valuable
that
no
trouble
was
too
great
to
be
incurred
even
though
the
probability
of
success
might
not
be
great
it
must
not
however
be
supposed
that
lady
rowley
carried
off
all
the
family
to
italy
including
sir
marmaduke
simply
in
chase
of
glascock
anxious
as
she
was
on
the
subject
she
was
too
proud
and
also
too
to
have
suggested
to
herself
such
a
journey
with
such
an
object
trevelyan
had
escaped
from
willesden
with
the
child
and
they
had
heard
again
through
stanbury
that
he
had
returned
to
italy
they
had
all
agreed
that
it
would
be
well
that
they
should
leave
london
for
awhile
and
see
something
of
the
continent
and
when
it
was
told
to
them
that
little
louis
was
probably
in
florence
that
alone
was
reason
enough
for
them
to
go
thither
they
would
go
to
the
city
till
the
heat
was
too
great
and
the
mosquitoes
too
powerful
and
then
they
would
visit
the
baths
of
lucca
for
a
month
this
was
their
plan
of
action
and
the
cause
for
their
plan
but
lady
rowley
found
herself
able
to
weave
into
it
another
little
plan
of
her
own
of
which
she
said
nothing
to
anybody
she
was
not
running
after
glascock
but
if
glascock
should
choose
to
run
after
them
or
her
who
could
say
that
any
harm
had
been
done
nora
had
answered
that
proposition
of
her
lover
to
walk
out
of
the
house
in
manchester
street
and
get
married
at
the
next
church
in
a
most
discreet
manner
she
had
declared
that
she
would
be
true
and
firm
but
that
she
did
not
wish
to
draw
upon
herself
the
displeasure
of
her
father
and
mother
she
did
not
she
said
look
upon
a
clandestine
marriage
as
a
happy
resource
but
this
she
added
at
the
end
of
a
long
and
very
sensible
letter
she
intended
to
abide
by
her
engagement
and
she
did
not
intend
to
go
back
to
the
mandarins
she
did
not
say
what
alternative
she
would
choose
in
the
event
of
her
being
unable
to
obtain
her
father
consent
before
his
return
she
did
not
suggest
what
was
to
become
of
her
when
sir
marmaduke
leave
of
absence
should
be
expired
but
her
statement
that
she
would
not
go
back
to
the
islands
was
certainly
made
with
more
substantial
vigour
though
perhaps
with
less
of
reasoning
than
any
other
of
the
propositions
made
in
her
letter
then
in
her
postscript
she
told
him
that
they
were
all
going
to
italy
papa
and
mamma
think
that
we
ought
to
follow
poor
trevelyan
the
lawyer
says
that
nothing
can
be
done
while
he
is
away
with
the
boy
we
are
therefore
all
going
to
start
to
florence
the
journey
is
delightful
i
will
not
say
whose
presence
will
be
wanting
to
make
it
perfect
before
they
started
there
came
a
letter
to
nora
from
dorothy
which
shall
be
given
entire
because
it
will
tell
the
reader
more
of
dorothy
happiness
than
would
be
learned
from
any
other
mode
of
narrative
the
close
thursday
dearest
nora
i
have
just
had
a
letter
from
hugh
and
that
makes
me
feel
that
i
should
like
to
write
to
you
dear
hugh
has
told
me
all
about
it
and
i
do
so
hope
that
things
may
come
right
and
that
we
may
be
sisters
he
is
so
good
that
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
should
love
him
he
has
been
the
best
son
and
the
best
brother
in
the
world
and
everybody
speaks
well
of
him
except
my
dear
aunt
who
is
prejudiced
because
she
does
not
like
newspapers
i
need
not
praise
him
to
you
for
i
dare
say
you
think
quite
as
well
of
him
as
i
do
i
can
not
tell
you
all
the
beautiful
things
he
says
about
you
but
i
dare
say
he
has
told
them
to
you
himself
i
seem
to
know
you
so
well
because
priscilla
has
talked
about
you
so
often
she
says
that
she
knew
that
you
and
my
brother
were
fond
of
each
other
because
you
growled
at
each
other
when
you
were
together
at
the
clock
house
and
never
had
any
civil
words
to
say
before
people
i
know
whether
growling
is
a
sign
of
love
but
hugh
does
growl
sometimes
when
he
is
most
affectionate
he
growls
at
me
and
i
understand
him
and
i
like
to
be
growled
at
i
wonder
whether
you
like
him
to
growl
at
you
and
now
i
must
tell
you
something
about
myself
because
if
you
are
to
be
my
sister
you
ought
to
know
it
all
i
also
am
going
to
be
married
to
a
man
whom
i
love
oh
so
dearly
his
name
is
brooke
burgess
and
he
is
a
great
friend
of
my
aunt
at
first
she
did
not
like
our
being
engaged
because
of
some
family
reason
but
she
has
got
over
that
and
nothing
can
be
kinder
and
nicer
than
she
is
we
are
to
be
married
here
some
day
in
june
the
i
think
it
will
be
how
i
do
wish
you
could
have
been
here
to
be
my
bridesmaid
it
would
have
been
so
nice
to
have
had
hugh
sweetheart
with
me
he
is
a
friend
of
hugh
and
no
doubt
you
will
hear
all
about
him
the
worst
of
it
is
that
we
must
live
in
london
because
my
husband
as
will
be
you
see
i
call
him
mine
already
is
in
an
office
there
and
so
poor
aunt
stanbury
will
be
left
all
alone
it
will
be
very
sad
and
she
is
so
wedded
to
exeter
that
i
fear
we
shall
not
get
her
up
to
london
i
would
describe
burgess
to
you
only
i
do
not
suppose
you
would
care
to
hear
about
him
he
is
not
so
tall
as
hugh
but
he
is
a
great
deal
better
looking
with
you
two
the
good
looks
are
to
be
with
the
wife
but
with
us
with
the
husband
perhaps
you
think
hugh
is
handsome
we
used
to
declare
that
he
was
the
ugliest
boy
in
the
country
i
do
suppose
it
makes
very
much
difference
brooke
is
handsome
but
i
do
think
i
should
like
him
the
less
if
he
were
ever
so
ugly
do
you
remember
hearing
about
the
miss
frenches
when
you
were
in
devonshire
there
has
come
up
such
a
terrible
affair
about
them
a
gibson
a
clergyman
was
going
to
marry
the
younger
but
has
changed
his
mind
and
wants
to
take
the
elder
i
think
he
was
in
love
with
her
first
dorothy
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
little
intermediate
stage
of
attachment
to
herself
all
this
is
making
a
great
noise
in
the
city
and
some
people
think
he
should
be
punished
severely
it
seems
to
me
that
a
gentleman
ought
not
to
make
such
a
mistake
but
if
he
does
he
ought
to
own
it
i
hope
they
will
let
him
marry
the
elder
one
aunt
stanbury
says
it
all
comes
from
their
wearing
chignons
i
wish
you
knew
aunt
stanbury
because
she
is
so
good
perhaps
you
wear
a
chignon
i
think
priscilla
said
that
you
did
it
must
not
be
large
if
you
come
to
see
aunt
stanbury
pray
write
to
me
and
believe
that
i
hope
to
be
your
most
affectionate
sister
dorothy
stanbury
i
am
so
happy
and
i
do
so
hope
that
you
will
be
the
same
this
was
received
only
a
day
before
the
departure
of
the
rowleys
for
italy
and
was
answered
by
a
short
note
promising
that
nora
would
write
to
her
correspondent
from
florence
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
trevelyan
had
started
with
his
boy
fearing
the
result
of
the
medical
or
legal
interference
with
his
affairs
which
was
about
to
be
made
at
sir
marmaduke
instance
he
had
written
a
few
words
to
his
wife
neither
commencing
nor
ending
his
note
after
any
usual
fashion
telling
her
that
he
thought
it
expedient
to
travel
that
he
had
secured
the
services
of
a
nurse
for
the
little
boy
and
that
during
his
absence
a
certain
income
would
as
heretofore
be
paid
to
her
he
said
nothing
as
to
his
probable
return
or
as
to
her
future
life
nor
was
there
anything
to
indicate
whither
he
was
going
stanbury
however
had
learned
from
the
faithless
and
frightened
bozzle
that
trevelyan
letters
were
to
be
sent
after
him
to
florence
bozzle
in
giving
this
information
had
acknowledged
that
his
employer
was
becoming
no
longer
quite
himself
under
his
troubles
and
had
expressed
his
opinion
that
he
ought
to
be
looked
after
bozzle
had
made
his
money
and
now
with
a
grain
of
humanity
mixed
with
many
grains
of
faithlessness
reconciled
it
to
himself
to
tell
his
master
secrets
to
his
enemies
what
would
a
counsel
be
able
to
say
about
his
conduct
in
a
court
of
law
that
was
the
question
which
bozzle
was
always
asking
himself
as
to
his
own
business
that
he
should
be
abused
by
a
barrister
to
a
jury
and
exposed
as
a
spy
and
a
fiend
was
he
thought
a
matter
of
course
to
be
so
abused
was
a
part
of
his
profession
but
it
was
expedient
for
him
in
all
cases
to
secure
some
of
apparent
duty
by
which
he
might
in
part
escape
from
such
censures
he
was
untrue
to
his
employer
now
because
he
thought
that
his
employer
ought
to
be
looked
after
he
did
no
doubt
take
a
note
from
hugh
stanbury
but
then
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
live
he
must
be
paid
for
his
time
in
this
way
trevelyan
started
for
florence
and
within
a
week
afterwards
the
rowleys
were
upon
his
track
nothing
had
been
said
by
sir
marmaduke
to
nora
as
to
her
lover
since
that
stormy
interview
in
which
both
father
and
daughter
had
expressed
their
opinions
very
strongly
and
very
little
had
been
said
by
lady
rowley
lady
rowley
had
spoken
more
than
once
of
nora
return
to
the
mandarins
and
had
once
alluded
to
it
as
a
certainty
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
shall
go
back
nora
had
said
my
dear
the
mother
had
replied
unless
you
are
married
i
suppose
your
home
must
be
with
your
parents
nora
having
made
her
protest
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
persevere
and
so
the
matter
was
dropped
it
was
known
however
that
they
must
all
come
back
to
london
before
they
started
for
their
seat
of
government
and
therefore
the
subject
did
not
at
present
assume
its
difficult
aspect
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
among
them
that
everything
should
be
done
to
make
the
journey
pleasant
to
the
young
mother
who
was
in
search
of
her
son
and
in
addition
to
this
lady
rowley
had
her
own
little
understanding
which
was
very
tacit
indeed
that
in
glascock
might
be
found
an
escape
from
one
of
their
great
family
difficulties
you
had
better
take
this
papa
trevelyan
had
said
when
she
received
from
the
office
of
bideawhile
a
cheque
payable
to
her
order
for
the
money
sent
to
her
by
her
husband
direction
i
do
not
want
the
man
money
said
sir
marmaduke
but
you
are
going
to
this
place
for
my
sake
papa
and
it
is
right
that
he
should
bear
the
expense
for
his
own
wife
and
papa
you
must
remember
always
that
though
his
mind
is
distracted
on
this
horrible
business
he
is
not
a
bad
man
no
one
is
more
liberal
or
more
just
about
money
sir
marmaduke
feelings
on
the
matter
were
very
much
the
same
as
those
which
had
troubled
outhouse
and
he
personally
refused
to
touch
the
money
but
his
daughter
paid
her
own
share
of
the
expenses
of
the
journey
they
travelled
at
their
ease
stopping
at
paris
and
at
geneva
and
at
milan
lady
rowley
thought
that
she
was
taken
very
fast
because
she
was
allowed
to
sleep
only
two
nights
at
each
of
these
places
and
sir
rowley
himself
thought
that
he
had
achieved
something
of
a
hannibalian
enterprise
in
taking
five
ladies
and
two
maids
over
the
simplon
and
down
into
the
plains
of
lombardy
with
nobody
to
protect
him
but
a
single
courier
he
had
been
a
little
nervous
about
it
being
unaccustomed
to
european
travelling
and
had
not
at
first
realised
the
fact
that
the
journey
is
to
be
made
with
less
trouble
than
one
from
the
marble
arch
to
mile
end
my
dears
he
said
to
his
younger
daughters
as
they
were
rattling
round
the
steep
downward
twists
and
turns
of
the
great
road
you
must
sit
quite
still
on
these
descents
or
you
do
not
know
where
you
may
go
the
least
thing
would
overset
us
but
lucy
and
sophy
soon
knew
better
and
became
so
intimate
with
the
mountain
under
the
friendly
guidance
of
their
courier
that
before
the
plains
were
reached
they
were
in
and
out
and
here
and
there
and
up
and
down
as
though
they
had
been
bred
among
the
valleys
of
the
pass
there
would
come
a
ringing
laugh
from
some
rock
above
their
head
and
lady
rowley
looking
up
would
see
their
dresses
fluttering
on
a
pinnacle
which
appeared
to
her
to
be
fit
only
for
a
bird
and
there
would
be
the
courier
behind
them
with
two
parasols
and
a
shawl
and
a
cloak
and
an
and
a
fine
pair
of
grizzled
whiskers
they
made
an
alpine
club
of
their
own
refusing
to
admit
their
father
because
he
would
not
climb
up
a
rock
and
nora
thought
of
the
letters
about
it
which
she
would
write
to
her
lover
only
that
she
had
determined
that
she
would
not
write
to
him
at
all
without
telling
her
mother
and
trevelyan
would
for
moments
almost
forget
that
she
had
been
robbed
of
her
child
from
milan
they
went
on
to
florence
and
though
they
were
by
that
time
quite
at
home
in
italy
and
had
become
critical
judges
of
italian
inns
and
italian
railways
they
did
not
find
that
journey
to
be
quite
so
pleasant
there
is
a
romance
to
us
still
in
the
name
of
italy
which
a
near
view
of
many
details
in
the
country
fails
to
realise
shall
we
say
that
a
journey
through
lombardy
is
about
as
interesting
as
one
through
the
flats
of
cambridgeshire
and
the
fens
of
norfolk
and
the
station
of
bologna
is
not
an
interesting
spot
in
which
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
although
it
may
be
conceded
that
provisions
may
be
had
there
much
better
than
any
that
can
be
procured
at
our
own
railway
stations
from
thence
they
went
still
by
rail
over
the
apennines
and
unfortunately
slept
during
the
whole
time
the
courier
had
assured
them
that
if
they
would
only
look
out
they
would
see
the
castles
of
which
they
had
read
in
novels
but
the
day
had
been
very
hot
and
sir
marmaduke
had
been
cross
and
lady
rowley
had
been
weary
and
so
not
a
castle
was
seen
pistoia
me
lady
this
said
the
courier
opening
the
door
to
stop
half
an
hour
oh
why
was
it
not
florence
another
hour
and
a
half
so
they
all
went
to
sleep
again
and
were
very
tired
when
they
reached
the
beautiful
city
during
the
next
day
they
rested
at
their
inn
and
sauntered
through
the
duomo
and
broke
their
necks
looking
up
at
the
inimitable
glories
of
the
campanile
such
a
one
as
sir
marmaduke
had
of
course
not
come
to
florence
without
introductions
the
foreign
office
is
always
very
civil
to
its
neighbour
of
the
colonies
civil
and
cordial
though
perhaps
a
little
patronising
a
minister
is
a
bigger
man
than
a
governor
and
the
smallest
of
the
diplomatic
fry
are
greater
swells
than
even
secretaries
in
quite
important
dependencies
the
attaché
though
he
be
unpaid
dwells
in
a
capital
and
flirts
with
a
countess
the
governor
man
is
confined
to
an
island
and
dances
with
a
planter
daughter
the
distinction
is
quite
understood
but
is
not
incompatible
with
much
excellent
good
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
superior
department
sir
marmaduke
had
come
to
florence
fairly
provided
with
passports
to
florentine
society
and
had
been
mentioned
in
more
than
one
letter
as
the
distinguished
governor
of
the
mandarins
who
had
been
called
home
from
his
seat
of
government
on
a
special
mission
of
great
importance
on
the
second
day
he
went
out
to
call
at
the
embassy
and
to
leave
his
cards
have
you
been
able
to
learn
whether
he
is
here
asked
lady
rowley
of
her
husband
in
a
whisper
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
who
trevelyan
i
did
not
suppose
you
could
learn
about
him
because
he
would
be
hiding
himself
but
is
glascock
here
i
forgot
to
ask
said
sir
marmaduke
lady
rowley
did
not
reproach
him
it
is
impossible
that
any
father
should
altogether
share
a
mother
anxiety
in
regard
to
the
marriage
of
their
daughters
but
what
a
thing
it
would
be
lady
rowley
thought
that
she
could
compound
for
all
misfortunes
in
other
respects
if
she
could
have
a
daughter
married
to
the
future
lord
peterborough
she
had
been
told
in
england
that
he
was
faultless
not
very
clever
not
very
active
not
likely
to
be
very
famous
but
as
a
husband
simply
faultless
he
was
very
rich
very
easily
managed
more
likely
to
be
proud
of
his
wife
than
of
himself
addicted
to
no
jealousies
afflicted
by
no
vices
so
respectable
in
every
way
that
he
was
sure
to
become
great
as
an
english
nobleman
by
the
very
weight
of
his
virtues
and
it
had
been
represented
also
to
lady
rowley
that
this
paragon
among
men
had
been
passionately
attached
to
her
daughter
perhaps
she
magnified
a
little
the
romance
of
the
story
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
greatly
endowed
lover
had
rushed
away
from
his
country
in
despair
because
her
daughter
nora
would
not
smile
upon
him
now
they
were
as
she
hoped
in
the
same
city
with
him
but
it
was
indispensable
to
her
success
that
she
should
not
seem
to
be
running
after
him
to
nora
not
a
word
had
been
said
of
the
prospect
of
meeting
glascock
at
florence
hardly
more
than
a
word
had
been
said
to
her
sister
emily
and
that
under
injunction
of
strictest
secrecy
it
must
be
made
to
appear
to
all
the
world
that
other
motives
had
brought
them
to
florence
as
indeed
other
motives
had
brought
them
not
for
worlds
would
lady
rowley
have
run
after
a
man
for
her
daughter
but
still
still
still
seeing
that
the
man
was
himself
so
unutterably
in
love
with
her
girl
seeing
that
he
was
so
fully
justified
by
his
position
to
be
in
love
with
any
girl
seeing
that
such
a
maximum
of
happiness
would
be
the
result
of
such
a
marriage
she
did
feel
that
even
for
his
sake
she
must
be
doing
a
good
thing
to
bring
them
together
something
though
not
much
of
all
this
she
had
been
obliged
to
explain
to
sir
marmaduke
and
yet
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
inquire
whether
glascock
was
in
florence
on
the
third
day
after
their
arrival
the
wife
of
the
british
minister
came
to
call
upon
lady
rowley
and
the
wife
of
the
british
minister
was
and
very
much
given
to
conversation
she
preferred
talking
to
listening
and
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
told
lady
rowley
a
good
deal
about
florence
but
she
had
not
mentioned
glascock
name
it
would
have
been
so
pleasant
if
the
requisite
information
could
have
been
obtained
without
the
asking
of
any
direct
question
on
the
subject
but
lady
rowley
who
from
many
years
practice
of
similar
though
perhaps
less
distinguished
courtesies
on
her
part
knew
well
the
first
symptom
of
the
coming
end
of
her
guest
visit
found
that
the
minister
wife
was
about
to
take
her
departure
without
an
allusion
to
glascock
and
yet
the
names
had
been
mentioned
of
so
many
english
residents
in
florence
who
neither
in
wealth
rank
or
virtue
were
competent
to
hold
a
candle
to
that
phoenix
she
was
forced
therefore
to
pluck
up
courage
and
to
ask
the
question
have
you
had
a
glascock
here
this
spring
said
lady
rowley
what
lord
peterborough
son
oh
dear
yes
such
a
singular
being
lady
rowley
thought
that
she
could
perceive
that
her
phoenix
had
not
made
himself
agreeable
at
the
embassy
it
might
perhaps
be
that
he
had
buried
himself
away
from
society
because
of
his
love
and
is
here
now
asked
lady
rowley
i
can
not
say
at
all
he
is
sometimes
here
and
sometimes
with
his
father
at
naples
but
when
here
he
lives
chiefly
with
the
americans
they
say
he
is
going
to
marry
an
american
girl
their
niece
there
are
three
of
them
i
think
and
he
is
to
take
the
eldest
lady
rowley
asked
no
more
questions
and
let
her
august
visitor
go
almost
without
another
word
chapter
lxxvi
we
shall
be
so
poor
glascock
at
that
moment
was
not
only
in
florence
but
was
occupying
rooms
in
the
very
hotel
in
which
the
rowleys
were
staying
lady
rowley
when
she
heard
that
he
was
engaged
to
marry
an
american
lady
became
suddenly
very
sick
at
heart
sick
with
a
sickness
that
almost
went
beyond
her
heart
she
felt
ill
and
was
glad
to
be
alone
the
rumour
might
be
untrue
such
rumours
generally
are
untrue
but
then
as
lady
rowley
knew
very
well
they
generally
have
some
foundation
in
truth
glascock
if
he
were
not
actually
engaged
to
the
american
girl
had
probably
been
flirting
with
her
and
if
so
where
was
that
picture
which
lady
rowley
had
been
painting
for
herself
of
a
swain
to
be
brought
back
to
the
pleasures
and
occupations
of
the
world
only
by
the
girl
of
whom
he
was
enamoured
but
still
she
would
not
quite
give
up
the
project
glascock
if
he
was
in
italy
would
no
doubt
see
by
the
newspapers
that
sir
marmaduke
and
his
family
were
in
florence
and
would
probably
come
to
them
then
if
nora
would
only
behave
herself
the
american
girl
might
still
be
conquered
during
two
or
three
days
after
this
nothing
was
seen
or
heard
of
glascock
had
lady
rowley
thought
of
mentioning
the
name
to
the
waiter
at
the
hotel
she
would
have
learned
that
he
was
living
in
the
next
passage
but
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
seek
information
in
that
fashion
nor
did
she
ask
direct
questions
in
other
quarters
about
glascock
himself
she
did
however
make
inquiry
about
americans
living
in
florence
especially
about
the
american
minister
and
before
a
week
had
passed
overhead
had
been
introduced
to
the
spaldings
spalding
was
very
civil
and
invited
lady
rowley
and
all
the
girls
and
sir
marmaduke
to
come
to
her
on
her
fridays
she
received
her
friends
every
friday
and
would
continue
to
do
so
till
the
middle
of
june
she
had
nieces
who
would
she
said
be
so
happy
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
miss
rowleys
by
this
time
the
picture
galleries
the
churches
and
the
palaces
in
florence
had
nearly
all
been
visited
poor
lady
rowley
had
dragged
herself
wearily
from
sight
to
sight
hoping
always
to
meet
with
glascock
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
residents
in
a
town
do
not
pass
their
mornings
habitually
in
looking
after
pictures
during
this
time
inquiries
were
being
made
through
the
police
respecting
trevelyan
and
sir
marmaduke
had
obtained
information
that
an
english
gentleman
with
a
little
boy
had
gone
on
to
siena
and
had
located
himself
there
there
seemed
to
be
but
little
doubt
that
this
was
trevelyan
though
nothing
had
been
learned
with
certainty
as
to
the
gentleman
name
it
had
been
decided
that
sir
marmaduke
with
his
courier
and
trevelyan
should
go
on
to
siena
and
endeavour
to
come
upon
the
fugitive
and
they
had
taken
their
departure
on
a
certain
morning
on
that
same
day
lady
rowley
was
walking
with
nora
and
one
of
the
other
girls
through
the
hall
of
the
hotel
when
they
were
met
in
full
face
by
glascock
lady
rowley
and
lucy
were
in
front
and
they
of
course
did
not
know
the
man
nora
had
seen
him
at
once
and
in
her
confusion
hardly
knew
how
to
bear
herself
glascock
was
passing
by
her
without
recognising
her
had
passed
her
mother
and
sister
and
had
so
far
gone
on
that
nora
had
determined
to
make
no
sign
when
he
chanced
to
look
up
and
see
who
it
was
that
was
so
close
to
him
miss
rowley
he
said
who
thought
of
meeting
you
in
florence
lady
rowley
of
course
turned
round
and
there
was
an
introduction
poor
nora
though
she
knew
nothing
of
her
schemes
was
confused
and
ill
at
ease
glascock
was
very
civil
but
at
the
same
time
rather
cold
lady
rowley
was
all
smiles
and
courtesy
she
had
she
said
heard
his
name
from
her
daughters
and
was
very
happy
to
make
his
acquaintance
lucy
looked
on
somewhat
astonished
to
find
that
the
lover
whom
her
sister
had
been
blamed
for
rejecting
and
who
was
spoken
of
with
so
many
encomiums
was
so
old
a
man
glascock
asked
after
trevelyan
and
lady
rowley
in
a
low
melancholy
whisper
told
him
that
they
were
now
all
in
florence
in
the
hope
of
meeting
trevelyan
you
have
heard
the
sad
story
i
know
glascock
and
therefore
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
glascock
acknowledged
that
he
did
know
the
story
and
informed
her
that
he
had
seen
trevelyan
in
florence
within
the
last
ten
days
this
was
so
interesting
that
at
lady
rowley
request
he
went
with
them
up
to
their
rooms
and
in
this
way
the
acquaintance
was
made
it
turned
out
that
glascock
had
spoken
to
trevelyan
and
that
trevelyan
had
told
him
that
he
meant
for
the
present
to
take
up
his
residence
in
some
small
italian
town
and
how
was
he
looking
mr
glascock
very
ill
lady
rowley
very
ill
indeed
do
not
tell
her
so
glascock
she
has
gone
now
with
her
father
to
siena
we
think
that
he
is
there
with
the
boy
or
at
least
that
he
may
be
heard
of
there
and
you
you
are
living
here
glascock
said
that
he
was
living
between
naples
and
florence
going
occasionally
to
naples
a
place
that
he
hated
to
see
his
father
and
coming
back
at
intervals
to
the
capital
nora
sat
by
and
hardly
spoke
a
word
she
was
nicely
dressed
with
an
exquisite
little
bonnet
which
had
been
bought
as
they
came
through
paris
and
lady
rowley
with
natural
pride
felt
that
if
he
was
ever
in
love
with
her
child
that
love
must
come
back
upon
him
now
american
girls
she
had
been
told
were
hard
and
dry
and
sharp
and
angular
she
had
seen
some
at
the
mandarins
with
whom
she
thought
it
must
be
impossible
that
any
englishman
should
be
in
love
there
never
surely
had
been
an
american
girl
like
her
nora
are
you
fond
of
pictures
mr
glascock
she
asked
glascock
was
not
very
fond
of
pictures
and
thought
that
he
was
rather
tired
of
them
what
was
he
fond
of
of
sitting
at
home
and
doing
nothing
that
was
his
reply
at
least
and
a
very
unsatisfactory
reply
it
was
as
lady
rowley
could
hardly
propose
that
they
should
come
and
sit
and
do
nothing
with
him
could
he
have
been
lured
into
churches
or
galleries
nora
might
have
been
once
more
thrown
into
his
company
then
lady
rowley
took
courage
and
asked
him
whether
he
knew
the
spaldings
they
were
going
to
spalding
that
very
evening
she
and
her
daughters
glascock
replied
that
he
did
know
the
spaldings
and
that
he
also
should
be
at
their
house
lady
rowley
thought
that
she
discovered
something
like
a
blush
about
his
cheekbones
and
brow
as
he
made
his
answer
then
he
left
them
giving
his
hand
to
nora
as
he
went
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
to
justify
the
slightest
hope
i
do
think
he
is
nice
at
all
said
lucy
do
be
so
foolish
lucy
said
lady
rowley
angrily
i
think
he
is
very
nice
said
nora
he
was
only
talking
nonsense
when
he
said
that
he
liked
to
sit
still
and
do
nothing
he
is
not
at
all
an
idle
man
at
least
i
am
told
so
but
he
is
as
old
as
methuselah
said
lucy
he
is
between
thirty
and
forty
said
lady
rowley
of
course
we
know
that
from
the
peerage
lady
rowley
however
was
wrong
had
she
consulted
the
peerage
she
would
have
seen
that
glascock
was
over
forty
nora
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
and
could
think
about
it
all
felt
quite
sure
that
glascock
would
never
make
her
another
offer
this
ought
not
to
have
caused
her
any
sorrow
as
she
was
very
well
aware
that
she
would
not
accept
him
should
he
do
so
yet
perhaps
there
was
a
moment
of
some
feeling
akin
to
disappointment
of
course
she
would
not
have
accepted
him
how
could
she
her
faith
was
so
plighted
to
hugh
stanbury
that
she
would
be
a
among
women
for
ever
were
she
to
be
so
false
and
as
she
told
herself
she
had
not
the
slightest
feeling
of
affection
for
glascock
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
and
a
matter
simply
for
speculation
nevertheless
it
would
have
been
a
very
grand
thing
to
be
lady
peterborough
and
she
almost
regretted
that
she
had
a
heart
in
her
bosom
she
had
become
fully
aware
during
that
interview
that
her
mother
still
entertained
hopes
and
almost
suspected
that
lady
rowley
had
known
something
of
glascock
residence
in
florence
she
had
seen
that
her
mother
had
met
glascock
almost
as
though
some
such
meeting
had
been
expected
and
had
spoken
to
him
almost
as
though
she
had
expected
to
have
to
speak
to
him
would
it
not
be
better
that
she
should
at
once
make
her
mother
understand
that
all
this
could
be
of
no
avail
if
she
were
to
declare
plainly
that
nothing
could
bring
about
such
a
marriage
would
not
her
mother
desist
she
almost
made
up
her
mind
to
do
so
but
as
her
mother
said
nothing
to
her
before
they
started
for
spalding
house
neither
did
she
say
anything
to
her
mother
she
did
not
wish
to
have
angry
words
if
they
could
be
avoided
and
she
felt
that
there
might
be
anger
and
unpleasant
words
were
she
to
insist
upon
her
devotion
to
hugh
stanbury
while
this
rich
prize
was
in
sight
if
her
mother
should
speak
to
her
then
indeed
she
would
declare
her
own
settled
purpose
but
she
would
do
nothing
to
accelerate
the
evil
hour
there
were
but
few
people
in
spalding
when
they
were
announced
and
glascock
was
not
among
them
miss
wallachia
petrie
was
there
and
in
the
confusion
of
the
introduction
was
presumed
by
lady
rowley
to
be
one
of
the
nieces
introduced
she
had
been
distinctly
told
that
glascock
was
to
marry
the
eldest
and
this
lady
was
certainly
older
than
the
other
two
in
this
way
lady
rowley
decided
that
miss
wallachia
petrie
was
her
daughter
hated
rival
and
she
certainly
was
much
surprised
at
the
gentleman
taste
but
there
is
nothing
nothing
in
the
way
of
an
absurd
matrimonial
engagement
into
which
a
man
will
not
allow
himself
to
be
entrapped
by
pique
nora
would
have
a
great
deal
to
answer
for
lady
rowley
thought
if
the
unfortunate
man
should
be
driven
by
her
cruelty
to
marry
such
a
woman
as
this
one
now
before
her
it
happened
that
lady
rowley
soon
found
herself
seated
by
miss
petrie
and
she
at
once
commenced
her
questionings
she
intended
to
be
very
discreet
but
the
subject
was
too
near
her
heart
to
allow
her
to
be
altogether
silent
i
believe
you
know
mr
glascock
she
said
yes
said
wallachia
i
do
know
him
now
the
peculiar
nasal
twang
which
our
cousins
over
the
water
have
learned
to
use
and
which
has
grown
out
of
a
certain
national
instinct
which
coerces
them
to
express
themselves
with
let
the
reader
go
into
his
closet
and
talk
through
his
nose
for
awhile
with
steady
attention
to
the
effect
which
his
own
voice
will
have
and
he
will
find
that
this
theory
is
correct
this
intonation
which
is
so
peculiar
among
intelligent
americans
had
been
adopted
con
amore
and
as
it
were
taken
to
her
bosom
by
miss
petrie
her
ears
had
taught
themselves
to
feel
that
there
could
be
no
vitality
in
speech
without
it
and
that
all
utterance
unsustained
by
such
tone
was
effeminate
vapid
useless
unpersuasive
unmusical
and
english
it
was
a
complaint
frequently
made
by
her
against
her
friends
caroline
and
olivia
that
they
debased
their
voices
and
taught
themselves
the
puling
british
mode
of
speech
i
do
know
the
gentleman
said
wallachia
and
lady
rowley
shuddered
could
it
be
that
such
a
woman
as
this
was
to
reign
over
monkhams
and
become
the
future
lady
peterborough
he
told
me
that
he
is
acquainted
with
the
family
said
lady
rowley
he
is
staying
at
our
hotel
and
my
daughter
knew
him
very
well
when
he
was
living
in
london
i
dare
say
i
believe
that
in
london
the
titled
aristocrats
do
hang
pretty
much
together
it
had
never
occurred
to
poor
lady
rowley
since
the
day
in
which
her
husband
had
been
made
a
knight
at
the
advice
of
the
colonial
minister
in
order
that
the
inhabitants
of
some
island
might
be
gratified
by
the
opportunity
of
using
the
title
that
she
and
her
children
had
thereby
become
aristocrats
were
her
daughter
nora
to
marry
glascock
nora
would
become
an
aristocrat
or
would
rather
be
ennobled
all
which
lady
rowley
understood
perfectly
i
do
know
that
london
society
is
very
exclusive
in
that
respect
said
lady
rowley
i
guess
you
are
pretty
particular
said
miss
petrie
and
it
seems
to
me
you
do
have
much
regard
to
intellect
or
erudition
but
fix
things
up
straight
according
to
birth
and
money
i
hope
we
are
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
said
lady
rowley
i
do
not
know
london
well
myself
as
i
have
passed
my
life
in
very
distant
places
the
distant
places
are
in
my
estimation
the
best
the
further
the
mind
is
removed
from
the
contamination
incidental
to
the
centres
of
luxury
the
more
chance
it
has
of
developing
itself
according
to
the
intention
of
the
creator
when
he
bestowed
his
gifts
of
intellect
upon
us
lady
rowley
when
she
heard
this
eloquence
could
hardly
believe
that
such
a
man
as
glascock
should
really
be
intent
upon
marrying
such
a
lady
as
this
who
was
sitting
next
to
her
in
the
meantime
nora
and
the
real
rival
were
together
and
they
also
were
talking
of
glascock
caroline
spalding
had
said
that
glascock
had
spoken
to
her
of
nora
rowley
and
nora
acknowledged
that
there
had
been
some
acquaintance
between
them
in
london
almost
more
than
that
i
should
have
thought
said
miss
spalding
if
one
might
judge
by
his
manner
of
speaking
of
you
illustration
the
rivals
he
is
a
little
given
to
be
enthusiastic
said
nora
laughing
the
least
so
of
all
mankind
i
should
have
said
you
must
know
he
is
very
intimate
in
this
house
it
begun
in
this
way
olivia
and
i
were
travelling
together
and
there
was
a
difficulty
as
we
say
in
our
country
when
three
or
four
gentlemen
shoot
each
other
then
there
came
up
glascock
and
another
gentleman
the
other
gentleman
was
your
poor
mr
trevelyan
he
is
very
ill
is
he
not
we
think
so
my
sister
is
with
us
you
know
that
is
to
say
she
is
at
siena
i
have
heard
about
him
and
it
is
so
sad
glascock
knows
him
as
i
said
they
were
travelling
together
when
glascock
came
to
our
assistance
since
that
we
have
seen
him
very
frequently
i
think
he
is
enthusiastic
except
when
he
talks
of
you
i
ought
to
be
very
proud
said
nora
i
think
you
ought
as
glascock
is
a
man
whose
good
opinion
is
certainly
worth
having
here
he
is
glascock
i
hope
your
ears
are
tingling
they
ought
to
do
so
because
we
are
saying
all
manner
of
fine
things
about
you
i
could
not
be
well
spoken
of
by
two
on
whose
good
word
i
should
set
a
higher
value
said
he
and
whose
do
you
value
the
most
said
caroline
i
must
first
know
whose
eulogium
will
run
the
highest
then
nora
answered
him
glascock
other
people
may
praise
you
louder
than
i
can
do
but
no
one
will
ever
do
so
with
more
sincerity
there
was
a
pretty
earnestness
about
her
as
she
spoke
which
lady
rowley
ought
to
have
heard
glascock
bowed
and
miss
spalding
smiled
and
nora
blushed
if
you
are
not
overwhelmed
now
said
miss
spalding
you
must
be
so
used
to
flattery
that
it
has
no
longer
any
effect
upon
you
you
must
be
like
a
drunkard
to
whom
wine
is
as
water
and
who
thinks
that
brandy
is
not
strong
enough
i
think
i
had
better
go
away
said
glascock
for
fear
the
brandy
should
be
watered
by
degrees
and
so
he
left
them
nora
had
become
quite
aware
without
much
process
of
thinking
about
it
that
her
former
lover
and
this
american
young
lady
were
very
intimate
with
each
other
the
tone
of
the
conversation
had
shewn
that
it
was
so
and
then
how
had
it
come
to
pass
that
glascock
had
spoken
to
this
american
girl
about
her
nora
rowley
it
was
evident
that
he
had
spoken
of
her
with
warmth
and
had
done
so
in
a
manner
to
impress
his
hearer
for
a
minute
or
two
they
sat
together
in
silence
after
glascock
had
left
them
but
neither
of
them
stirred
then
caroline
spalding
turned
suddenly
upon
nora
and
took
her
by
the
hand
i
must
tell
you
something
said
she
only
it
must
be
a
secret
for
awhile
i
will
not
repeat
it
thank
you
dear
i
am
engaged
to
him
as
his
wife
he
asked
me
this
very
afternoon
and
nobody
knows
it
but
my
aunt
when
i
had
accepted
him
he
told
me
all
the
story
about
you
he
had
very
often
spoken
of
you
before
and
i
had
guessed
how
it
must
have
been
he
wears
his
heart
so
open
for
those
whom
he
loves
that
there
is
nothing
concealed
he
had
seen
you
just
before
he
came
to
me
but
perhaps
i
am
wrong
to
tell
you
that
now
he
ought
to
have
been
thinking
of
you
again
at
such
a
time
i
did
not
want
him
to
think
of
me
again
of
course
you
did
not
of
course
i
am
joking
you
might
have
been
his
wife
if
you
wished
it
he
has
told
me
all
that
and
he
especially
wants
us
to
be
friends
is
there
anything
to
prevent
it
on
my
part
oh
dear
no
except
that
you
will
be
such
grand
folk
and
we
shall
be
so
poor
we
said
caroline
laughing
i
am
so
glad
that
there
is
a
chapter
lxxvii
the
future
lady
peterborough
if
you
have
not
sold
yourself
for
british
gold
and
for
british
acres
and
for
british
rank
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
said
miss
wallachia
petrie
that
same
evening
to
her
friend
caroline
spalding
you
know
that
i
have
not
sold
myself
as
you
call
it
said
caroline
there
had
been
a
long
friendship
between
these
two
ladies
and
the
younger
one
knew
that
it
behoved
her
to
bear
a
good
deal
from
the
elder
miss
petrie
was
honest
clever
and
in
earnest
we
in
england
are
not
usually
favourably
disposed
to
women
who
take
a
pride
in
a
certain
antagonism
to
men
in
general
and
who
are
anxious
to
shew
the
world
that
they
can
get
on
very
well
without
male
assistance
but
there
are
many
such
in
america
who
have
noble
aspirations
good
intellects
much
energy
and
who
are
by
no
means
unworthy
of
friendship
the
hope
in
regard
to
all
such
women
the
hope
entertained
not
by
themselves
but
by
those
who
are
solicitous
for
them
is
that
they
will
be
cured
at
last
by
a
husband
and
children
in
regard
to
wallachia
petrie
there
was
not
perhaps
much
ground
for
such
hope
she
was
so
positively
wedded
to
women
rights
in
general
and
to
her
own
rights
in
particular
that
it
was
improbable
that
she
should
ever
succumb
to
any
man
and
where
would
be
the
man
brave
enough
to
make
the
effort
from
circumstances
caroline
spalding
had
been
the
beloved
of
her
heart
since
caroline
spalding
was
a
very
little
girl
and
she
had
hoped
that
caroline
would
through
life
have
borne
arms
along
with
her
in
that
contest
which
she
was
determined
to
wage
against
man
and
which
she
always
waged
with
the
greatest
animosity
against
men
of
the
british
race
she
hated
rank
she
hated
riches
she
hated
monarchy
and
with
a
true
woman
instinct
in
battle
felt
that
she
had
a
specially
strong
point
against
englishmen
in
that
they
submitted
themselves
to
dominion
from
a
woman
monarch
and
now
the
chosen
friend
of
her
youth
the
friend
who
had
copied
out
all
her
poetry
who
had
learned
by
heart
all
her
sonnets
who
had
as
she
thought
reciprocated
all
her
ideas
was
going
to
be
married
and
to
be
married
to
an
english
lord
she
had
seen
that
it
was
coming
for
some
time
and
had
spoken
out
very
plainly
hoping
that
she
might
still
save
the
brand
from
the
burning
now
the
evil
was
done
and
caroline
spalding
when
she
told
her
news
knew
well
that
she
would
have
to
bear
some
heavy
reproaches
how
many
of
us
are
there
who
never
know
whether
we
sell
ourselves
or
not
said
wallachia
the
senator
who
longs
for
office
and
who
votes
this
way
instead
of
that
in
order
that
he
may
get
it
thinks
that
he
is
voting
honestly
the
minister
who
calls
himself
a
teacher
of
god
word
thinks
that
it
is
god
word
that
he
preaches
when
he
strains
his
lungs
to
fill
his
church
the
question
is
this
caroline
would
you
have
loved
the
same
man
had
he
come
to
you
with
a
woodman
axe
in
his
hand
or
a
clerk
quill
behind
his
ear
i
guess
not
as
to
the
woodman
axe
wally
it
is
very
well
in
theory
but
things
good
in
theory
caroline
will
be
good
also
when
practised
you
may
be
sure
of
that
we
dislike
theory
simply
because
our
intelligences
are
higher
than
our
wills
but
we
will
let
that
pass
pray
let
it
pass
wally
do
not
preach
me
sermons
i
am
so
happy
and
you
ought
to
wish
me
joy
if
wishing
you
joy
would
get
you
joy
i
would
wish
it
you
while
i
lived
i
can
not
be
happy
that
you
should
be
taken
from
us
whither
i
shall
never
see
you
again
but
you
are
to
come
to
us
i
have
told
him
so
and
it
is
settled
no
dear
i
shall
not
do
that
what
should
i
be
in
the
glittering
halls
of
an
english
baron
could
there
be
any
visiting
less
fitting
any
admixture
less
appropriate
could
i
who
have
held
up
my
voice
in
the
music
hall
of
lacedæmon
amidst
the
glories
of
the
west
in
the
great
and
free
state
of
illinois
against
the
corruption
of
an
english
aristocracy
could
i
who
have
been
listened
to
by
two
thousand
of
my
countrywomen
and
men
while
i
spurned
the
unmanly
inhuman
errors
of
primogeniture
could
i
think
you
hold
my
tongue
beneath
the
roof
of
a
feudal
lord
caroline
spalding
knew
that
her
friend
could
not
hold
her
tongue
and
hesitated
to
answer
there
had
been
that
fatal
triumph
of
a
lecture
on
the
joint
rights
of
men
and
women
and
it
had
rendered
poor
wallachia
petrie
unfit
for
ordinary
society
you
might
come
there
without
talking
politics
wally
said
caroline
no
caroline
no
i
will
go
into
the
house
of
no
man
in
which
the
free
expression
of
my
opinion
is
debarred
me
i
will
not
sit
even
at
your
table
with
a
muzzled
tongue
when
you
are
gone
caroline
i
shall
devote
myself
to
what
after
all
must
be
the
work
of
my
life
and
i
shall
finish
the
biographical
history
of
our
great
hero
in
verse
which
i
hope
may
at
least
be
not
ephemeral
from
month
to
month
i
shall
send
you
what
i
do
and
you
will
not
refuse
me
your
friendly
criticism
and
perhaps
some
slight
meed
of
approbation
because
you
are
dwelling
beneath
the
shade
of
a
throne
oh
caroline
let
it
not
be
a
upas
tree
the
miss
petries
of
the
world
have
this
advantage
an
advantage
which
rarely
if
ever
falls
to
the
lot
of
a
man
that
they
are
never
convinced
of
error
men
let
them
be
ever
so
much
devoted
to
their
closets
let
them
keep
their
work
ever
so
closely
veiled
from
public
scrutiny
still
find
themselves
subjected
to
criticism
and
under
the
necessity
of
either
defending
themselves
or
of
succumbing
if
indeed
a
man
neither
speaks
nor
writes
if
he
be
dumb
as
regards
opinion
he
passes
simply
as
one
of
the
crowd
and
is
in
the
way
neither
of
convincing
nor
of
being
convinced
but
a
woman
may
speak
and
almost
write
as
she
likes
without
danger
of
being
wounded
by
sustained
conflict
who
would
have
the
courage
to
begin
with
such
a
one
as
miss
petrie
and
endeavour
to
prove
to
her
that
she
is
wrong
from
the
beginning
a
little
word
of
a
smile
a
shrug
and
an
ambiguous
compliment
which
is
misunderstood
are
all
the
forms
of
argument
which
can
be
used
against
her
wallachia
petrie
in
her
heart
of
hearts
conceived
that
she
had
fairly
discussed
her
great
projects
from
year
to
year
with
indomitable
eloquence
and
unanswerable
truth
and
that
none
of
her
opponents
had
had
a
leg
to
stand
upon
and
this
she
believed
because
the
chivalry
of
men
had
given
to
her
sex
that
protection
against
which
her
life
was
one
continued
protest
here
he
is
said
caroline
as
glascock
came
up
to
them
try
and
say
a
civil
word
to
him
if
he
speaks
about
it
though
he
is
to
be
a
lord
still
he
is
a
man
and
a
brother
caroline
said
the
stern
monitress
you
are
already
learning
to
laugh
at
principles
which
have
been
dear
to
you
since
you
left
your
mother
breast
alas
how
true
it
is
can
not
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
the
further
progress
of
these
friendly
and
feminine
amenities
was
stopped
by
the
presence
of
the
gentleman
who
had
occasioned
them
miss
petrie
said
the
hero
of
the
hour
caroline
was
to
tell
you
of
my
good
fortune
and
no
doubt
she
has
done
so
i
can
not
wait
to
hear
the
pretty
things
he
has
to
say
said
caroline
and
i
must
look
after
my
aunt
guests
there
is
poor
signor
buonarosci
without
a
soul
to
say
a
syllable
to
him
and
i
must
go
and
use
my
ten
italian
words
you
are
about
to
take
with
you
to
your
old
country
glascock
said
miss
petrie
one
of
the
brightest
stars
in
our
young
american
firmament
there
could
be
no
doubt
from
the
tone
of
miss
voice
that
she
now
regarded
this
star
however
bright
as
one
of
a
sort
which
is
subjected
to
falling
i
am
going
to
take
a
very
nice
young
woman
said
glascock
i
hate
that
word
woman
sir
uttered
with
the
sneer
which
always
accompanies
its
expression
from
the
mouth
of
a
man
sneer
miss
petrie
i
quite
allow
that
it
is
involuntary
and
not
analysed
or
understood
by
yourselves
if
you
speak
of
a
dog
you
intend
to
do
so
with
affection
but
there
is
always
contempt
mixed
with
it
the
chivalry
of
man
to
woman
is
all
begotten
in
the
same
spirit
i
want
no
favour
but
i
claim
to
be
your
equal
i
thought
that
american
ladies
were
generally
somewhat
exacting
as
to
those
privileges
which
chivalry
gives
them
it
is
true
sir
that
the
only
rank
we
know
in
our
country
is
in
that
precedence
which
man
gives
to
woman
whether
we
maintain
that
or
whether
we
abandon
it
we
do
not
intend
to
purchase
it
at
the
price
of
an
acknowledgment
of
intellectual
inferiority
for
myself
i
hate
chivalry
what
you
call
chivalry
i
can
carry
my
own
chair
and
i
claim
the
right
to
carry
it
whithersoever
i
may
please
glascock
remained
with
her
for
some
time
but
made
no
opportunity
for
giving
that
invitation
to
monkhams
of
which
caroline
had
spoken
as
he
said
afterwards
he
found
it
impossible
to
expect
her
to
attend
to
any
subject
so
trivial
and
when
afterwards
caroline
told
him
with
some
slight
mirth
the
capability
of
which
on
such
a
subject
was
coming
to
her
with
her
new
ideas
of
life
that
though
he
was
partly
saved
as
a
man
and
a
brother
still
he
was
partly
the
reverse
as
a
feudal
lord
he
began
to
reflect
that
wallachia
petrie
would
be
a
guest
with
whom
he
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
things
go
pleasant
at
monkhams
does
she
not
bully
you
horribly
he
asked
of
course
she
bullies
me
caroline
answered
and
i
can
not
expect
you
to
understand
as
yet
how
it
is
that
i
love
her
and
like
her
but
i
do
if
i
were
in
distress
she
would
give
everything
she
has
in
the
world
to
put
me
right
so
would
i
said
he
ah
you
that
is
a
matter
of
course
that
is
your
business
now
and
she
would
give
everything
she
has
in
the
world
to
set
the
world
right
would
you
do
that
it
would
depend
on
the
amount
of
my
faith
if
i
could
believe
in
the
result
i
suppose
i
should
do
it
she
would
do
it
on
the
slightest
hope
that
such
giving
would
have
any
tendency
that
way
her
philanthropy
is
all
real
of
course
she
is
a
bore
to
you
i
am
very
patient
i
hope
i
shall
find
you
so
always
and
of
course
she
is
ridiculous
in
your
eyes
i
have
learned
to
see
it
and
to
regret
it
but
i
shall
never
cease
to
love
her
i
have
not
the
slightest
objection
her
lessons
will
come
from
over
the
water
and
mine
will
come
from
where
shall
i
say
over
the
table
if
i
ca
talk
her
down
with
so
much
advantage
on
my
side
i
ought
to
be
made
a
man
myself
poor
lady
rowley
had
watched
miss
petrie
and
glascock
during
those
moments
that
they
had
been
together
and
had
half
believed
the
rumour
and
had
half
doubted
thinking
in
the
moments
of
her
belief
that
glascock
must
be
mad
and
in
the
moments
of
unbelief
that
the
rumours
had
been
set
afloat
by
the
english
minister
wife
with
the
express
intention
of
turning
glascock
into
ridicule
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
doubt
that
wallachia
was
the
eldest
of
that
family
of
nieces
could
it
be
possible
that
a
man
who
had
known
her
nora
who
had
undoubtedly
loved
her
nora
who
had
travelled
all
the
way
from
london
to
nuncombe
putney
to
ask
nora
to
be
his
wife
should
within
twelve
months
of
that
time
have
resolved
to
marry
a
woman
whom
he
must
have
selected
simply
as
being
the
most
opposite
to
nora
of
any
female
human
being
that
he
could
find
it
was
not
credible
to
her
and
if
it
were
not
true
there
might
still
be
a
hope
nora
had
met
him
and
had
spoken
to
him
and
it
had
seemed
that
for
a
moment
or
two
they
had
spoken
as
friends
lady
rowley
when
talking
to
spalding
had
watched
them
closely
and
she
had
seen
that
nora
eyes
had
been
bright
and
that
there
had
been
something
between
them
which
was
pleasant
suddenly
she
found
herself
close
to
wallachia
and
thought
that
she
would
trust
herself
to
a
word
have
you
been
long
in
florence
asked
lady
rowley
in
her
softest
voice
a
pretty
considerable
time
that
is
since
the
fall
began
what
a
voice
what
an
accent
and
what
words
was
there
a
man
living
with
sufficient
courage
to
take
this
woman
to
england
and
shew
her
to
the
world
as
lady
peterborough
are
you
going
to
remain
in
italy
for
the
summer
continued
lady
rowley
i
guess
i
shall
or
perhaps
locate
myself
in
the
purer
atmosphere
of
the
swiss
mountains
switzerland
in
summer
must
certainly
be
much
pleasanter
i
was
thinking
at
the
moment
of
the
political
atmosphere
said
miss
petrie
for
although
certainly
much
has
been
done
in
this
country
in
the
way
of
striking
off
shackles
and
treading
sceptres
under
foot
still
lady
rowley
there
remains
here
that
pernicious
thing
a
king
the
feeling
of
the
dominion
of
a
single
man
and
that
of
a
single
woman
is
for
aught
i
know
worse
with
me
so
clouds
the
air
that
the
breath
i
breathe
fails
to
fill
my
lungs
wallachia
as
she
said
this
put
forth
her
hand
and
raised
her
chin
and
extended
her
arm
she
paused
feeling
that
justice
demanded
that
lady
rowley
should
have
a
right
of
reply
but
lady
rowley
had
not
a
word
to
say
and
wallachia
petrie
went
on
i
can
not
adapt
my
body
to
the
sweet
savours
and
the
soft
luxuries
of
the
outer
world
with
any
comfort
to
my
inner
self
while
the
circumstances
of
the
society
around
me
are
oppressive
to
my
spirit
when
our
war
was
raging
all
around
me
i
was
as
the
lark
that
mounts
through
the
morning
sky
i
should
have
thought
it
was
very
dreadful
said
lady
rowley
full
of
dread
of
awe
and
of
horror
were
those
fiery
days
of
indiscriminate
slaughter
but
they
were
not
days
of
desolation
because
hope
was
always
there
by
our
side
there
was
a
hope
in
which
the
soul
could
trust
and
the
trusting
soul
is
ever
light
and
buoyant
i
dare
say
it
is
said
lady
rowley
but
apathy
and
serfdom
and
kinghood
and
dominion
drain
the
fountain
of
its
living
springs
and
the
soul
becomes
like
the
plummet
of
lead
whose
only
tendency
is
to
hide
itself
in
subaqueous
mud
and
unsavoury
slush
subaqueous
mud
and
unsavoury
slush
lady
rowley
repeated
the
words
to
herself
as
she
made
good
her
escape
and
again
expressed
to
herself
her
conviction
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
so
the
subaqueous
mud
and
unsavoury
slush
with
all
that
had
gone
before
it
about
the
soul
was
altogether
unintelligible
to
her
but
she
knew
that
it
was
american
buncom
of
a
high
order
of
eloquence
and
she
told
herself
again
and
again
that
it
could
not
be
so
she
continued
to
keep
her
eyes
upon
glascock
and
soon
saw
him
again
talking
to
nora
it
was
hardly
possible
she
thought
that
nora
should
speak
to
him
with
so
much
animation
or
he
to
her
unless
there
was
some
feeling
between
them
which
if
properly
handled
might
lead
to
a
renewal
of
the
old
tenderness
she
went
up
to
nora
having
collected
the
other
girls
and
said
that
the
carriage
was
then
waiting
for
them
glascock
immediately
offered
lady
rowley
his
arm
and
took
her
down
to
the
hall
could
it
be
that
she
was
leaning
upon
a
future
there
was
something
in
the
thought
which
made
her
lay
her
weight
upon
him
with
a
freedom
which
she
would
not
otherwise
have
used
oh
that
her
nora
should
live
to
be
lady
peterborough
we
are
apt
to
abuse
mothers
for
wanting
high
husbands
for
their
daughters
but
can
there
be
any
point
in
which
the
true
maternal
instinct
can
shew
itself
with
more
affectionate
enthusiasm
this
poor
mother
wanted
nothing
for
herself
from
glascock
she
knew
very
well
that
it
was
her
fate
to
go
back
to
the
mandarins
and
probably
to
die
there
she
knew
also
that
such
men
as
glascock
when
they
marry
beneath
themselves
in
rank
and
fortune
will
not
ordinarily
trouble
themselves
much
with
their
there
was
nothing
desired
for
herself
were
such
a
match
accomplished
she
might
perhaps
indulge
herself
in
talking
among
the
planters
wives
of
her
daughter
coronet
but
at
the
present
moment
there
was
no
idea
even
of
this
in
her
mind
it
was
of
nora
herself
and
of
nora
sisters
that
she
was
thinking
for
them
that
she
was
plotting
that
the
one
might
be
rich
and
splendid
and
the
others
have
some
path
opened
for
them
to
riches
and
splendour
mothers
may
be
injudicious
but
surely
they
are
maternal
and
unselfish
glascock
put
her
into
the
carriage
and
squeezed
her
hand
and
then
he
squeezed
nora
hand
she
saw
it
and
was
sure
of
it
i
am
so
glad
you
are
going
to
be
happy
nora
had
said
to
him
before
this
as
far
as
i
have
seen
her
i
like
her
so
much
if
you
do
not
come
and
visit
her
in
her
own
house
i
shall
think
you
have
no
spirit
of
friendship
he
said
i
will
nora
had
replied
i
will
this
had
been
said
just
as
lady
rowley
was
coming
to
them
and
on
this
understanding
on
this
footing
glascock
had
pressed
her
hand
as
she
went
home
lady
rowley
mind
was
full
of
doubt
as
to
the
course
which
it
was
best
that
she
should
follow
with
her
daughter
she
was
not
unaware
how
great
was
the
difficulty
before
her
hugh
stanbury
name
had
not
been
mentioned
since
they
left
london
but
at
that
time
nora
was
obstinately
bent
on
throwing
herself
away
upon
the
she
had
never
been
brought
to
acknowledge
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
even
inappropriate
and
had
withstood
gallantly
the
expression
of
her
father
displeasure
but
with
such
a
spirit
as
nora
it
might
be
easier
to
prevail
by
silence
than
by
many
words
lady
rowley
was
quite
sure
of
this
that
it
would
be
far
better
to
say
nothing
further
of
hugh
stanbury
let
the
cure
come
if
it
might
be
possible
from
absence
and
from
her
daughter
good
sense
the
only
question
was
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
say
any
word
about
glascock
in
the
carriage
she
was
not
only
forbearing
but
flattering
in
her
manner
to
nora
she
caressed
her
girl
hand
and
spoke
to
her
as
mothers
know
how
to
speak
when
they
want
to
make
much
of
their
girls
and
to
have
it
understood
that
those
girls
are
behaving
as
girls
should
behave
there
was
to
be
nobody
to
meet
them
as
it
had
been
arranged
that
sir
marmaduke
and
trevelyan
should
sleep
at
siena
hardly
a
word
had
been
spoken
in
the
carriage
but
in
their
there
came
a
moment
in
which
lucy
and
sophie
had
left
them
and
nora
was
alone
with
her
mother
lady
rowley
almost
knew
that
it
would
be
most
prudent
to
be
silent
but
a
word
spoken
in
season
how
good
it
is
and
the
thing
was
so
near
to
her
that
she
could
not
hold
her
peace
i
must
say
nora
she
began
that
i
do
like
your
mr
glascock
he
is
not
my
glascock
mamma
said
nora
smiling
you
know
what
i
mean
dear
lady
rowley
had
not
intended
to
utter
a
word
that
should
appear
like
pressure
on
her
daughter
at
this
moment
she
had
felt
how
imprudent
it
would
be
to
do
so
but
now
nora
seemed
to
be
leading
the
way
herself
to
such
discourse
of
course
he
is
not
your
glascock
you
can
not
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
nor
can
you
throw
it
away
and
have
it
i
have
thrown
my
cake
away
altogether
and
certainly
i
can
not
have
it
she
was
still
smiling
as
she
spoke
and
seemed
to
be
quite
merry
at
the
idea
of
regarding
glascock
as
the
cake
which
she
had
declined
to
eat
i
can
see
one
thing
quite
plainly
dear
what
is
that
mamma
that
in
spite
of
what
you
have
done
you
can
still
have
your
cake
whenever
you
choose
to
take
it
why
mamma
he
is
engaged
to
be
married
mr
glascock
yes
glascock
it
quite
settled
is
it
not
sad
to
whom
is
he
engaged
lady
rowley
solemnity
as
she
asked
this
question
was
piteous
to
behold
to
miss
spalding
caroline
spalding
the
eldest
of
those
nieces
yes
the
eldest
i
can
not
believe
it
mamma
they
both
told
me
so
i
have
sworn
an
eternal
friendship
with
her
already
i
did
not
see
you
speaking
to
her
but
i
did
talk
to
her
a
great
deal
and
he
is
really
going
to
marry
that
dreadful
woman
dreadful
mamma
perfectly
awful
she
talked
to
me
in
a
way
that
i
have
read
about
in
books
but
which
i
did
not
before
believe
to
be
possible
do
you
mean
that
he
is
going
to
be
married
to
that
hideous
old
maid
that
oh
mamma
what
slander
i
think
her
so
pretty
pretty
very
pretty
and
mamma
ought
i
not
to
be
happy
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
make
himself
so
happy
it
was
quite
quite
quite
impossible
that
i
should
have
been
his
wife
i
have
thought
about
it
ever
so
much
and
i
am
so
glad
of
it
i
think
she
is
just
the
girl
that
is
fit
for
him
lady
rowley
took
her
candle
and
went
to
bed
professing
to
herself
that
she
could
not
understand
it
but
what
did
it
signify
it
was
at
any
rate
certain
now
that
the
man
had
put
himself
out
of
reach
and
if
he
chose
to
marry
a
republican
virago
with
a
red
nose
it
could
now
make
no
difference
to
nora
lady
rowley
almost
felt
a
touch
of
satisfaction
in
reflecting
on
the
future
misery
of
his
married
life
chapter
lxxviii
casalunga
sir
marmaduke
had
been
told
at
the
florence
that
he
would
no
doubt
be
able
to
hear
tidings
of
trevelyan
and
to
learn
his
address
from
the
officials
in
the
at
siena
at
florence
he
had
been
introduced
to
some
gentleman
who
was
certainly
of
importance
a
superintendent
who
had
clerks
under
him
and
who
was
a
big
man
this
person
had
been
very
courteous
to
him
and
he
had
gone
to
siena
thinking
that
he
would
find
it
easy
to
obtain
address
or
to
learn
that
there
was
no
such
person
there
but
at
siena
he
and
his
courier
together
could
obtain
no
information
they
rambled
about
the
huge
cathedral
and
the
picturesque
of
that
quaint
old
city
for
the
whole
day
and
on
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
they
returned
to
florence
they
had
learned
nothing
the
young
man
at
the
had
simply
protested
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
name
of
trevelyan
if
letters
should
come
addressed
to
such
a
name
he
would
keep
them
till
they
were
called
for
but
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
he
had
never
seen
or
heard
the
name
at
the
of
the
gendarmerie
they
could
not
or
would
not
give
him
any
information
and
sir
marmaduke
came
back
with
an
impression
that
everybody
at
siena
was
ignorant
idiotic
and
brutal
trevelyan
was
so
dispirited
as
to
be
ill
and
both
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
were
disposed
to
think
that
the
world
was
all
against
them
you
have
no
conception
of
the
sort
of
woman
that
man
is
going
to
marry
said
lady
rowley
what
man
glascock
a
horrid
american
female
as
old
almost
as
i
am
who
talks
through
her
nose
and
preaches
sermons
about
the
rights
of
women
it
is
incredible
and
nora
might
have
had
him
just
for
lifting
up
her
hand
but
sir
marmaduke
could
not
interest
himself
much
about
glascock
when
he
had
been
told
that
his
daughter
had
refused
the
heir
to
a
great
estate
and
a
peerage
it
had
been
matter
of
regret
but
he
had
looked
upon
the
affair
as
done
and
cared
nothing
now
though
glascock
should
marry
a
transatlantic
xantippe
he
was
angry
with
nora
because
by
her
obstinacy
she
was
adding
to
the
general
perplexities
of
the
family
but
he
could
not
make
comparisons
on
glascock
behalf
between
her
and
miss
spalding
as
his
wife
was
doing
either
mentally
or
aloud
from
hour
to
hour
i
suppose
it
is
too
late
now
said
lady
rowley
shaking
her
head
of
course
it
is
too
late
the
man
must
marry
whom
he
pleases
i
am
beginning
to
wonder
that
anybody
should
ever
want
to
get
married
i
am
indeed
but
what
are
the
girls
to
do
i
do
know
what
anybody
is
to
do
here
is
a
man
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
and
yet
nobody
can
touch
him
if
it
was
not
for
the
child
i
should
advise
emily
to
put
him
out
of
her
head
altogether
but
though
sir
marmaduke
could
not
bring
himself
to
take
any
interest
in
glascock
affairs
and
would
not
ask
a
single
question
respecting
the
fearful
american
female
whom
this
unfortunate
man
was
about
to
translate
to
the
position
of
an
english
peeress
yet
circumstances
so
fell
out
that
before
three
days
were
over
he
and
glascock
were
thrown
together
in
very
intimate
relations
sir
marmaduke
had
learned
that
glascock
was
the
only
englishman
in
florence
to
whom
trevelyan
had
been
known
and
that
he
was
the
only
person
with
whom
trevelyan
had
been
seen
to
speak
while
passing
through
the
city
in
his
despair
therefore
sir
marmaduke
had
gone
to
glascock
and
it
was
soon
arranged
that
the
two
gentlemen
should
renew
the
search
at
siena
together
without
having
with
them
either
trevelyan
or
the
courier
glascock
knew
the
ways
of
the
people
better
than
did
sir
marmaduke
and
could
speak
the
language
he
obtained
a
passport
to
the
good
offices
of
the
police
of
siena
and
went
prepared
to
demand
rather
than
to
ask
for
assistance
they
started
very
early
before
breakfast
and
on
arriving
at
siena
at
about
noon
first
employed
themselves
in
recruiting
exhausted
nature
by
the
time
that
they
had
both
declared
that
the
hotel
at
siena
was
the
very
worst
in
all
italy
and
that
a
breakfast
without
eatable
butter
was
not
to
be
considered
a
breakfast
at
all
they
had
become
so
intimate
that
glascock
spoke
of
his
own
intended
marriage
he
must
have
done
this
with
the
conviction
on
his
mind
that
nora
rowley
would
have
told
her
mother
of
his
former
intention
and
that
lady
rowley
would
have
told
sir
marmaduke
but
he
did
not
feel
it
to
be
incumbent
on
himself
to
say
anything
on
that
subject
he
had
nothing
to
excuse
he
had
behaved
fairly
and
honourably
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
he
should
remain
unmarried
for
ever
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
who
had
twice
refused
him
of
course
there
are
very
many
in
england
he
said
who
will
think
me
foolish
to
marry
a
girl
from
another
country
it
is
done
every
day
said
sir
marmaduke
no
doubt
it
is
i
admit
however
that
i
ought
to
be
more
careful
than
some
other
persons
there
is
a
title
and
an
estate
to
be
perpetuated
and
i
can
not
perhaps
be
justified
in
taking
quite
so
much
liberty
as
some
other
men
may
do
but
i
think
i
have
chosen
a
woman
born
to
have
a
high
position
and
who
will
make
her
own
way
in
any
society
in
which
she
may
be
placed
i
have
no
doubt
she
will
said
sir
marmaduke
who
had
still
sounding
in
his
ears
the
alarming
description
which
his
wife
had
given
him
of
this
infatuated
man
proposed
bride
but
he
would
have
been
bound
to
say
as
much
had
glascock
intended
to
marry
as
lowly
as
did
king
cophetua
she
is
highly
educated
as
sweetly
soft
as
any
english
girl
i
ever
met
and
very
pretty
you
have
met
her
i
think
i
do
not
remember
that
i
have
observed
her
she
is
too
young
for
me
perhaps
said
glascock
but
that
is
a
fault
on
the
right
side
sir
marmaduke
as
he
wiped
his
beard
after
his
breakfast
remembered
what
his
wife
had
told
him
about
the
age
but
it
was
nothing
to
him
she
is
i
think
said
glascock
if
glascock
chose
to
believe
that
his
intended
wife
was
instead
of
something
over
forty
that
was
nothing
to
sir
marmaduke
the
very
best
age
in
the
world
said
he
they
had
sent
for
an
officer
of
the
police
and
before
they
had
been
three
hours
in
siena
they
had
been
told
that
trevelyan
lived
about
seven
miles
from
the
town
in
a
small
and
very
remote
country
house
which
he
had
hired
for
twelve
months
from
one
of
the
city
hospitals
he
had
hired
it
furnished
and
had
purchased
a
horse
and
small
carriage
from
a
man
in
the
town
to
this
man
they
went
and
it
soon
became
evident
to
them
that
he
of
whom
they
were
in
search
was
living
at
this
house
which
was
called
casalunga
and
was
not
as
the
police
officer
told
them
on
the
way
to
any
place
they
must
leave
siena
by
the
road
for
rome
take
a
turn
to
the
left
about
a
mile
beyond
the
city
gate
and
continue
on
along
the
country
lane
till
they
saw
a
certain
round
hill
to
the
right
on
the
top
of
that
round
hill
was
casalunga
as
the
country
about
siena
all
lies
in
round
hills
this
was
no
adequate
description
but
it
was
suggested
that
the
country
people
would
know
all
about
it
they
got
a
small
open
carriage
in
the
and
were
driven
out
their
driver
knew
nothing
of
casalunga
and
simply
went
whither
he
was
told
but
by
the
aid
of
the
country
people
they
got
along
over
the
unmade
lanes
and
in
little
more
than
an
hour
were
told
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
that
they
must
now
walk
up
to
casalunga
though
the
hill
was
and
no
more
than
a
hill
still
the
ascent
at
last
was
very
steep
and
was
paved
with
stones
set
edgeway
in
a
manner
that
could
hardly
have
been
intended
to
accommodate
wheels
when
glascock
asserted
that
the
signor
who
lived
there
had
a
carriage
of
his
own
the
driver
suggested
that
he
must
keep
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
it
was
clearly
not
his
intention
to
attempt
to
drive
up
the
ascent
and
sir
marmaduke
and
glascock
were
therefore
obliged
to
walk
it
was
now
in
the
latter
half
of
may
and
there
was
a
blazing
italian
sky
over
their
heads
glascock
was
acclimated
to
italian
skies
and
did
not
much
mind
the
work
but
sir
marmaduke
who
never
did
much
in
walking
declared
that
italy
was
infinitely
hotter
than
the
mandarins
and
could
hardly
make
his
way
as
far
as
the
house
door
it
seemed
to
both
of
them
to
be
a
most
singular
abode
for
such
a
man
as
trevelyan
at
the
top
of
the
hill
there
was
a
huge
entrance
through
a
wooden
gateway
which
seemed
to
have
been
constructed
with
the
intention
of
defying
any
intruders
not
provided
with
warlike
ammunition
the
gates
were
indeed
open
at
the
period
of
their
visit
but
it
must
be
supposed
that
they
were
intended
to
be
closed
at
any
rate
at
night
immediately
on
the
right
as
they
entered
through
the
gates
there
was
a
large
barn
in
which
two
men
were
coopering
wine
vats
from
thence
a
path
led
slanting
to
the
house
of
which
the
door
was
shut
and
all
the
front
windows
blocked
with
shutters
the
house
was
very
long
and
only
of
one
story
for
a
portion
of
its
length
over
that
end
at
which
the
door
was
placed
there
were
upper
rooms
and
there
must
have
been
space
enough
for
a
large
family
with
many
domestics
there
was
nothing
round
or
near
the
residence
which
could
be
called
a
garden
so
that
its
look
of
desolation
was
extreme
there
were
various
large
barns
and
outhouses
as
though
it
had
been
intended
by
the
builder
that
corn
and
hay
and
cattle
should
be
kept
there
but
it
seemed
now
that
there
was
nothing
there
except
the
empty
vats
at
which
the
two
men
were
coopering
had
the
englishmen
gone
farther
into
the
granary
they
would
have
seen
that
there
were
stored
away
in
the
dark
corners
they
stopped
and
looked
at
the
men
and
the
men
halted
for
a
moment
from
their
work
and
looked
at
them
but
the
men
spoke
never
a
word
glascock
then
asked
after
trevelyan
and
one
of
the
coopers
pointed
to
the
house
then
they
crossed
over
to
the
door
and
glascock
finding
there
neither
knocker
nor
bell
first
tapped
with
his
knuckles
and
then
struck
with
his
stick
but
no
one
came
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
house
and
no
shutter
was
removed
i
believe
that
there
is
a
soul
here
said
sir
marmaduke
we
not
give
it
up
till
we
seen
it
all
at
any
rate
said
glascock
and
so
they
went
round
to
the
other
front
on
this
side
of
the
house
the
tilled
ground
either
ploughed
or
dug
with
the
spade
came
up
to
the
very
windows
there
was
hardly
even
a
particle
of
grass
to
be
seen
a
short
way
down
the
hill
there
were
rows
of
olive
trees
standing
in
prim
order
and
at
regular
distances
from
which
hung
the
vines
that
made
the
coopering
of
the
vats
necessary
olives
and
vines
have
pretty
names
and
call
up
associations
of
landscape
beauty
but
here
they
were
in
no
way
beautiful
the
ground
beneath
them
was
turned
up
and
brown
and
arid
so
that
there
was
not
a
blade
of
grass
to
be
seen
on
some
furrows
the
maize
or
indian
corn
was
sprouting
and
there
were
patches
of
growth
of
other
kinds
each
patch
closely
marked
by
its
own
straight
lines
and
there
were
narrow
paths
so
constructed
as
to
take
as
little
room
as
possible
but
all
that
had
been
done
had
been
done
for
economy
and
nothing
for
beauty
the
occupiers
of
casalunga
had
thought
more
of
the
produce
of
their
land
than
of
picturesque
or
attractive
appearance
the
sun
was
blazing
fiercely
hot
hotter
on
this
side
sir
marmaduke
thought
even
than
on
the
other
and
there
was
not
a
wavelet
of
a
cloud
in
the
sky
a
balcony
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
house
and
under
this
sir
marmaduke
took
shelter
at
once
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
wall
there
is
not
a
soul
here
at
all
said
he
the
men
in
the
barn
told
us
that
there
was
said
glascock
and
at
any
rate
we
will
try
the
windows
so
saying
he
walked
along
the
front
of
the
house
sir
marmaduke
following
him
slowly
till
they
came
to
a
door
the
upper
half
of
which
was
glazed
and
through
which
they
looked
into
one
of
the
rooms
two
or
three
of
the
other
windows
in
this
frontage
of
the
house
came
down
to
the
ground
and
were
made
for
egress
and
ingress
but
they
had
all
been
closed
with
shutters
as
though
the
house
was
deserted
but
they
now
looked
into
a
room
which
contained
some
signs
of
habitation
there
was
a
small
table
with
a
marble
top
on
which
lay
two
or
three
books
and
there
were
two
in
the
room
with
gilded
arms
and
legs
and
a
morsel
of
carpet
and
a
clock
on
a
shelf
over
a
stove
and
a
the
boy
is
here
you
may
be
sure
said
glascock
the
makes
that
certain
but
how
are
we
to
get
at
any
one
i
never
saw
such
a
place
for
an
englishman
to
come
and
live
in
before
said
sir
marmaduke
what
on
earth
can
he
do
here
all
day
as
he
spoke
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
there
was
trevelyan
standing
before
them
looking
at
them
through
the
window
he
wore
an
old
red
english
which
came
down
to
his
feet
and
a
small
braided
italian
cap
on
his
head
his
beard
had
been
allowed
to
grow
and
he
had
neither
collar
nor
cravat
his
trousers
were
unbraced
and
he
shuffled
in
with
a
pair
of
slippers
which
would
hardly
cling
to
his
feet
he
was
paler
and
still
thinner
than
when
he
had
been
visited
at
willesden
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
larger
and
shone
almost
with
a
brighter
brilliancy
glascock
tried
to
open
the
door
but
found
that
it
was
closed
sir
marmaduke
and
i
have
come
to
visit
you
said
glascock
aloud
is
there
any
means
by
which
we
can
get
into
the
house
trevelyan
stood
still
and
stared
at
them
we
knocked
at
the
front
door
but
nobody
came
continued
glascock
i
suppose
this
is
the
way
you
usually
go
in
and
out
he
does
not
mean
to
let
us
in
whispered
sir
marmaduke
can
you
open
this
door
said
glascock
or
shall
we
go
round
again
trevelyan
had
stood
still
contemplating
them
but
at
last
came
forward
and
put
back
the
bolt
that
is
all
right
said
glascock
entering
i
am
sure
you
will
be
glad
to
see
sir
marmaduke
i
should
be
glad
to
see
him
or
you
if
i
could
entertain
you
said
trevelyan
his
voice
was
harsh
and
hard
and
his
words
were
uttered
with
a
certain
amount
of
intended
grandeur
any
of
the
family
would
be
welcome
were
it
not
were
it
not
what
asked
glascock
it
can
be
nothing
to
you
sir
what
troubles
i
have
here
this
is
my
own
abode
in
which
i
had
flattered
myself
that
i
could
be
free
from
intruders
i
do
not
want
visitors
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
had
trouble
in
coming
here
but
i
do
not
want
visitors
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
have
nothing
that
i
can
offer
you
mr
glascock
emily
is
in
florence
said
sir
marmaduke
who
brought
her
did
i
tell
her
to
come
let
her
go
back
to
her
home
i
have
come
here
to
be
free
from
her
and
i
mean
to
be
free
if
she
wants
my
money
let
her
take
it
she
wants
her
child
said
glascock
he
is
my
child
said
trevelyan
and
my
right
to
him
is
better
than
hers
let
her
try
it
in
a
court
of
law
and
she
shall
see
why
did
she
deceive
me
with
that
man
why
has
she
driven
me
to
this
look
here
glascock
my
whole
life
is
spent
in
this
seclusion
and
it
is
her
fault
your
wife
is
innocent
of
all
fault
trevelyan
said
glascock
any
woman
can
say
as
much
as
that
and
all
women
do
say
it
yet
what
are
they
worth
do
you
mean
sir
to
take
away
your
wife
character
said
sir
marmaduke
coming
up
in
wrath
remember
that
she
is
my
daughter
and
that
there
are
things
which
flesh
and
blood
can
not
stand
she
is
my
wife
sir
and
that
is
ten
times
more
do
you
think
that
you
would
do
more
for
her
than
i
would
do
drink
more
of
esill
you
had
better
go
away
sir
marmaduke
you
can
do
no
good
by
coming
here
and
talking
of
your
daughter
i
would
have
given
the
world
to
save
her
but
she
would
not
be
saved
you
are
a
slanderer
said
sir
marmaduke
in
his
wrath
glascock
turned
round
to
the
father
and
tried
to
quiet
him
it
was
so
manifest
to
him
that
the
balance
of
the
poor
man
mind
was
gone
that
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
ridiculous
to
upbraid
the
sufferer
he
was
such
a
piteous
sight
to
behold
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
feel
indignation
against
him
you
can
not
wonder
said
glascock
advancing
close
to
the
master
of
the
house
that
the
mother
should
want
to
see
her
only
child
you
do
not
wish
that
your
wife
should
be
the
most
wretched
woman
in
the
world
am
not
i
the
most
wretched
of
men
can
anything
be
more
wretched
than
this
is
her
life
worse
than
mine
and
whose
fault
was
it
had
i
any
friend
to
whom
she
objected
was
i
untrue
to
her
in
a
single
thought
if
you
say
that
she
was
untrue
it
is
a
falsehood
said
sir
marmaduke
you
allow
yourself
a
liberty
of
expression
sir
because
you
are
my
wife
father
said
trevelyan
which
you
would
not
dare
to
take
in
other
circumstances
i
say
that
it
is
a
false
calumny
a
lie
and
i
would
say
so
to
any
man
on
earth
who
should
dare
to
slander
my
child
name
your
child
sir
she
is
my
wife
my
wife
my
wife
trevelyan
as
he
spoke
advanced
close
up
to
his
and
at
last
hissed
out
his
words
with
his
lips
close
to
sir
marmaduke
face
your
right
in
her
is
gone
sir
she
is
mine
mine
mine
and
you
see
the
way
in
which
she
has
treated
me
glascock
everything
i
had
was
hers
but
the
words
of
a
sinner
were
sweeter
to
her
than
all
my
love
i
wonder
whether
you
think
that
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
for
such
a
one
as
i
to
come
out
here
and
live
in
such
a
place
as
this
i
have
not
a
friend
a
companion
hardly
a
book
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
eat
or
drink
i
do
not
stir
out
of
the
house
and
i
am
ill
very
ill
look
at
me
see
what
she
has
brought
me
to
glascock
on
my
honour
as
a
man
i
never
wronged
her
in
a
thought
or
a
word
glascock
had
come
to
think
that
his
best
chance
of
doing
any
good
was
to
get
trevelyan
into
conversation
with
himself
free
from
the
interruption
of
sir
marmaduke
the
father
of
the
injured
woman
could
not
bring
himself
to
endure
the
hard
words
that
were
spoken
of
his
daughter
during
this
last
speech
he
had
broken
out
once
or
twice
but
trevelyan
not
heeding
him
had
clung
to
glascock
arm
sir
marmaduke
said
he
would
you
not
like
to
see
the
boy
he
shall
not
see
the
boy
said
trevelyan
you
may
see
him
he
shall
not
what
is
he
that
he
should
have
control
over
me
this
is
the
most
fearful
thing
i
ever
heard
of
said
sir
marmaduke
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
glascock
whispered
a
few
words
to
sir
marmaduke
and
then
declared
that
he
was
ready
to
be
taken
to
the
child
and
he
will
remain
here
asked
trevelyan
a
pledge
was
then
given
by
sir
marmaduke
that
he
would
not
force
his
way
farther
into
the
house
and
the
two
other
men
left
the
chamber
together
sir
marmaduke
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
alone
perspiring
at
every
pore
thoroughly
uncomfortable
and
ill
at
ease
thought
of
all
the
hard
positions
of
which
he
had
ever
read
and
that
his
was
harder
than
them
all
here
was
a
man
married
to
his
daughter
in
possession
of
his
daughter
child
manifestly
mad
and
yet
he
could
do
nothing
to
him
he
was
about
to
return
to
the
seat
of
his
government
and
he
must
leave
his
own
child
in
this
madman
power
of
course
his
daughter
could
not
go
with
him
leaving
her
child
in
this
hands
he
had
been
told
that
even
were
he
to
attempt
to
prove
the
man
to
be
mad
in
italy
the
process
would
be
slow
and
before
it
could
be
well
commenced
trevelyan
would
be
off
with
the
child
elsewhere
there
never
was
an
embarrassment
thought
sir
marmaduke
out
of
which
it
was
so
impossible
to
find
a
clear
way
in
the
meantime
glascock
and
trevelyan
were
visiting
the
child
it
was
evident
that
the
father
let
him
be
ever
so
mad
had
discerned
the
expediency
of
allowing
some
one
to
see
that
his
son
was
alive
and
in
health
glascock
did
not
know
much
of
children
and
could
only
say
afterwards
that
the
boy
was
silent
and
very
melancholy
but
clean
and
apparently
well
it
appeared
that
he
was
taken
out
daily
by
his
father
in
the
cool
hours
of
the
morning
and
that
his
father
hardly
left
him
from
the
time
that
he
was
taken
up
till
he
was
put
to
bed
but
glascock
desire
was
to
see
trevelyan
alone
and
this
he
did
after
they
had
left
the
boy
and
now
trevelyan
he
said
what
do
you
mean
to
do
to
do
in
what
way
do
you
propose
to
live
i
want
you
to
be
reasonable
with
me
they
do
not
treat
me
reasonably
are
you
going
to
measure
your
own
conduct
by
that
of
other
people
in
the
first
place
you
should
go
back
to
england
what
good
can
you
do
here
trevelyan
shook
his
head
but
remained
silent
you
can
not
like
this
life
no
indeed
but
whither
can
i
go
now
that
i
shall
like
to
live
why
not
home
i
have
no
home
why
not
go
back
to
england
ask
your
wife
to
join
you
and
return
with
her
she
would
go
at
a
word
the
poor
wretch
again
shook
his
head
i
hope
you
think
that
i
speak
as
your
friend
said
glascock
i
believe
you
do
i
will
say
nothing
of
any
imprudence
but
you
can
not
believe
that
she
has
been
untrue
to
you
trevelyan
would
say
nothing
to
this
but
stood
silent
waiting
for
glascock
to
continue
let
her
come
back
to
you
here
and
then
as
soon
as
you
can
arrange
it
go
to
your
own
home
shall
i
tell
you
something
said
trevelyan
what
is
it
he
came
up
close
to
glascock
and
put
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
i
will
tell
you
what
she
would
do
at
once
i
dare
say
that
she
would
come
to
me
i
dare
say
that
she
would
go
with
me
i
am
sure
she
would
and
directly
she
got
me
there
she
would
say
that
i
was
mad
she
my
wife
would
do
it
he
that
furious
ignorant
old
man
below
tried
to
do
it
before
his
wife
said
that
i
was
mad
he
paused
a
moment
as
though
waiting
for
a
reply
but
glascock
had
none
to
make
it
had
not
been
his
object
in
the
advice
which
he
had
given
to
entrap
the
poor
fellow
by
a
snare
and
to
induce
him
so
to
act
that
he
should
deliver
himself
up
to
keepers
but
he
was
well
aware
that
wherever
trevelyan
might
be
it
would
be
desirable
that
he
should
be
placed
for
awhile
in
the
charge
of
some
physician
he
could
not
bring
himself
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
repudiate
the
idea
by
which
trevelyan
was
actuated
perhaps
you
think
that
she
would
be
right
said
trevelyan
i
am
quite
sure
that
she
would
do
nothing
that
is
not
for
the
best
said
glascock
i
can
see
it
all
i
will
not
go
back
to
england
glascock
i
intend
to
travel
i
shall
probably
leave
this
and
go
to
to
to
greece
perhaps
it
is
a
healthy
place
this
and
i
like
it
for
that
reason
but
i
shall
not
stay
here
if
my
wife
likes
to
travel
with
me
she
can
come
but
to
england
i
will
not
go
you
will
let
the
child
go
to
his
mother
certainly
not
if
she
wants
to
see
the
child
he
is
here
if
she
will
come
without
her
father
she
shall
see
him
she
shall
not
take
him
from
hence
nor
shall
she
return
to
live
with
me
without
full
acknowledgment
of
her
fault
and
promises
of
an
amended
life
i
know
what
i
am
saying
glascock
and
have
thought
of
these
things
perhaps
more
than
you
have
done
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
coming
to
me
but
now
if
you
please
i
would
prefer
to
be
alone
glascock
seeing
that
nothing
further
could
be
done
joined
sir
marmaduke
and
the
two
walked
down
to
their
carriage
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
glascock
as
he
went
declared
his
conviction
that
the
unfortunate
man
was
altogether
mad
and
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
obtain
some
interference
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
for
the
protection
of
the
child
how
this
could
be
done
or
whether
it
could
be
done
in
time
to
intercept
a
further
flight
on
the
part
of
trevelyan
glascock
could
not
say
it
was
his
idea
that
trevelyan
should
herself
go
out
to
casalunga
and
try
the
force
of
her
own
persuasion
i
believe
that
he
would
murder
her
said
sir
marmaduke
he
would
not
do
that
there
is
a
glimmer
of
sense
in
all
his
madness
which
will
keep
him
from
any
actual
violence
chapter
lxxix
i
can
sleep
on
the
boards
three
days
after
this
there
came
another
carriage
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
on
which
casalunga
stood
and
a
lady
got
out
of
it
all
alone
it
was
emily
trevelyan
and
she
had
come
thither
from
siena
in
quest
of
her
husband
and
her
child
on
the
previous
day
sir
marmaduke
courier
had
been
at
the
house
with
a
note
from
the
wife
to
the
husband
and
had
returned
with
an
answer
in
which
trevelyan
was
told
that
if
she
would
come
quite
alone
she
should
see
her
child
sir
marmaduke
had
been
averse
to
any
further
intercourse
with
the
man
other
than
what
might
be
made
in
accordance
with
medical
advice
and
if
possible
with
government
authority
lady
rowley
had
assented
to
her
daughter
wish
but
had
suggested
that
she
should
at
least
be
allowed
to
go
also
at
any
rate
as
far
as
the
bottom
of
the
hill
but
emily
had
been
very
firm
and
glascock
had
supported
her
he
was
confident
that
the
man
would
do
no
harm
to
her
and
he
was
indisposed
to
believe
that
any
interference
on
the
part
of
the
italian
government
could
be
procured
in
such
a
case
with
sufficient
celerity
to
be
of
use
he
still
thought
it
might
be
possible
that
the
wife
might
prevail
over
the
husband
or
the
mother
over
the
father
sir
marmaduke
was
at
last
obliged
to
yield
and
trevelyan
went
to
siena
with
no
other
companion
but
the
courier
from
siena
she
made
the
journey
quite
alone
and
having
learned
the
circumstances
of
the
house
from
glascock
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
walked
up
the
hill
there
were
still
the
two
men
coopering
at
the
vats
but
she
did
not
stay
to
speak
to
them
she
went
through
the
big
gates
and
along
the
slanting
path
to
the
door
not
doubting
of
her
way
for
glascock
had
described
it
all
to
her
making
a
small
plan
of
the
premises
and
even
explaining
to
her
the
position
of
the
room
in
which
her
boy
and
her
husband
slept
she
found
the
door
open
and
an
italian
at
once
welcomed
her
to
the
house
and
assured
her
that
the
signor
would
be
with
her
immediately
she
was
sure
that
the
girl
knew
that
she
was
the
mother
and
was
almost
tempted
to
ask
questions
at
once
as
to
the
state
of
the
household
but
her
knowledge
of
italian
was
slight
and
she
felt
that
she
was
so
utterly
a
stranger
in
the
land
that
she
could
dare
to
trust
no
one
though
the
heat
was
great
her
face
was
covered
with
a
thick
veil
her
dress
was
black
from
head
to
foot
and
she
was
as
a
woman
who
mourned
for
her
husband
she
was
led
into
the
room
which
her
father
had
been
allowed
to
enter
through
the
window
and
here
she
sat
in
her
husband
house
feeling
that
in
no
position
in
the
world
could
she
be
more
utterly
separated
from
the
interests
of
all
around
her
in
a
few
minutes
the
door
was
opened
and
her
husband
was
with
her
bringing
the
boy
in
his
hand
he
had
dressed
himself
with
some
care
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
garments
which
he
wore
did
not
make
him
appear
thinner
even
and
more
haggard
than
he
had
looked
to
be
in
his
old
he
had
not
shaved
himself
but
his
long
hair
was
brushed
back
from
his
forehead
after
a
fashion
quaint
and
very
foreign
to
his
former
ideas
of
dress
his
wife
had
not
expected
that
her
child
would
come
to
her
at
once
had
thought
that
some
entreaties
would
be
necessary
some
obedience
perhaps
exacted
from
her
before
she
would
be
allowed
to
see
him
and
now
her
heart
was
softened
and
she
was
grateful
to
her
husband
but
she
could
not
speak
to
him
till
she
had
had
the
boy
in
her
arms
she
tore
off
her
bonnet
and
then
clinging
to
the
child
covered
him
with
kisses
louey
my
darling
louey
you
remember
mamma
the
child
pressed
himself
close
to
the
mother
bosom
but
spoke
never
a
word
he
was
cowed
and
overcome
not
only
by
the
incidents
of
the
moment
but
by
the
terrible
melancholy
of
his
whole
life
he
had
been
taught
to
understand
without
actual
spoken
lessons
that
he
was
to
live
with
his
father
and
that
the
former
happinesses
of
his
life
were
at
an
end
in
this
second
visit
from
his
mother
he
did
not
forget
her
he
recognised
the
luxury
of
her
love
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
even
to
hope
that
she
might
have
come
to
rescue
him
from
the
evil
of
his
days
trevelyan
was
standing
by
the
while
looking
on
but
he
did
not
speak
till
she
addressed
him
i
am
so
thankful
to
you
for
bringing
him
to
me
she
said
i
told
you
that
you
should
see
him
he
said
perhaps
it
might
have
been
better
that
i
should
have
sent
him
by
a
servant
but
there
are
circumstances
which
make
me
fear
to
let
him
out
of
my
sight
do
you
think
that
i
did
not
wish
to
see
you
also
louis
why
do
you
do
me
so
much
wrong
why
do
you
treat
me
with
such
cruelty
then
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
before
he
could
repulse
her
before
he
could
reflect
whether
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
repulse
her
or
not
she
had
covered
his
brow
and
cheeks
and
lips
with
kisses
louis
she
said
louis
speak
to
me
it
is
hard
to
speak
sometimes
he
said
illustration
it
is
hard
to
speak
sometimes
you
love
me
louis
yes
i
love
you
but
i
am
afraid
of
you
what
is
it
that
you
fear
i
would
give
my
life
for
you
if
you
would
only
come
back
to
me
and
let
me
feel
that
you
believed
me
to
be
true
he
shook
his
head
and
began
to
think
while
she
still
clung
to
him
he
was
quite
sure
that
her
father
and
mother
had
intended
to
bring
a
mad
doctor
down
upon
him
and
he
knew
that
his
wife
was
in
her
mother
hands
should
he
yield
to
her
now
should
he
make
her
any
promise
might
not
the
result
be
that
he
would
be
shut
up
in
dark
rooms
robbed
of
his
liberty
robbed
of
what
he
loved
better
than
his
liberty
his
power
as
a
man
she
would
thus
get
the
better
of
him
and
take
the
child
and
the
world
would
say
that
in
this
contest
between
him
and
her
he
had
been
the
sinning
one
and
she
the
one
against
whom
the
sin
had
been
done
it
was
the
chief
object
of
his
mind
the
one
thing
for
which
he
was
eager
that
this
should
never
come
to
pass
let
it
once
be
conceded
to
him
from
all
sides
that
he
had
been
right
and
then
she
might
do
with
him
almost
as
she
willed
he
knew
well
that
he
was
ill
when
he
thought
of
his
child
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
was
dying
he
was
at
some
moments
of
his
miserable
existence
fearfully
anxious
to
come
to
terms
with
his
wife
in
order
that
at
his
death
his
boy
might
not
be
without
a
protector
were
he
to
die
then
it
would
be
better
that
his
child
should
be
with
its
mother
in
his
happy
days
immediately
after
his
marriage
he
had
made
a
will
in
which
he
had
left
his
entire
property
to
his
wife
for
her
life
providing
for
its
subsequent
descent
to
his
child
or
children
it
had
never
even
occurred
to
his
poor
shattered
brain
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
alter
his
will
had
he
really
believed
that
his
wife
had
betrayed
him
doubtless
he
would
have
done
so
he
would
have
hated
her
have
distrusted
her
altogether
and
have
believed
her
to
be
an
evil
thing
he
had
no
such
belief
but
in
his
desire
to
achieve
empire
and
in
the
sorrows
which
had
come
upon
him
in
his
unsuccessful
struggle
his
mind
had
wavered
so
frequently
that
his
spoken
words
were
no
true
indicators
of
his
thoughts
and
in
all
his
arguments
he
failed
to
express
either
his
convictions
or
his
desires
when
he
would
say
something
stronger
than
he
intended
and
it
would
be
put
to
him
by
his
wife
by
her
father
or
mother
or
by
some
friend
of
hers
whether
he
did
believe
that
she
had
been
untrue
to
him
he
would
recoil
from
the
answer
which
his
heart
would
dictate
lest
he
should
seem
to
make
an
acknowledgment
that
might
weaken
the
ground
upon
which
he
stood
then
he
would
satisfy
his
own
conscience
by
assuring
himself
that
he
had
never
accused
her
of
such
sin
she
was
still
clinging
to
him
now
as
his
mind
was
working
after
this
fashion
louis
she
said
let
it
all
be
as
though
there
had
been
nothing
how
can
that
be
my
dear
not
to
others
but
to
us
it
can
be
so
there
shall
be
no
word
spoken
of
the
past
again
he
shook
his
head
will
it
not
be
best
that
there
should
be
no
word
spoken
may
be
spoken
with
the
tongue
he
said
beginning
to
quote
from
a
poem
which
had
formerly
been
frequent
in
his
hands
can
not
there
be
real
forgiveness
between
you
and
me
between
husband
and
wife
who
in
truth
love
each
other
do
you
think
that
i
would
tell
you
of
it
again
he
felt
that
in
all
that
she
said
there
was
an
assumption
that
she
had
been
right
and
that
he
had
been
wrong
she
was
promising
to
forgive
she
was
undertaking
to
forget
she
was
willing
to
take
him
back
to
the
warmth
of
her
love
and
the
comfort
of
her
kindness
but
was
not
asking
to
be
taken
back
this
was
what
he
could
not
and
would
not
endure
he
had
determined
that
if
she
behaved
well
to
him
he
would
not
be
harsh
to
her
and
he
was
struggling
to
keep
up
to
his
resolve
he
would
accuse
her
of
nothing
if
he
could
help
it
but
he
could
not
say
a
word
that
would
even
imply
that
she
need
forget
that
she
should
forgive
it
was
for
him
to
forgive
and
he
was
willing
to
do
it
if
she
would
accept
forgiveness
i
will
never
speak
a
word
louis
she
said
laying
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
your
heart
is
still
hardened
he
replied
slowly
hard
to
you
and
your
mind
is
dark
you
do
not
see
what
you
have
done
in
our
religion
emily
forgiveness
is
sure
not
after
penitence
but
with
repentance
what
does
that
mean
it
means
this
that
though
i
would
welcome
you
back
to
my
arms
with
joy
i
can
not
do
so
till
you
have
confessed
your
fault
what
fault
louis
if
i
have
made
you
unhappy
i
do
indeed
grieve
that
it
has
been
so
it
is
of
no
use
said
he
i
can
not
talk
about
it
do
you
suppose
that
it
does
not
tear
me
to
the
very
soul
to
think
of
it
what
is
it
that
you
think
louis
as
she
had
been
travelling
thither
she
had
determined
that
she
would
say
anything
that
he
wished
her
to
say
make
any
admission
that
might
satisfy
him
that
she
could
be
happy
again
as
other
women
are
happy
she
did
not
expect
but
if
it
could
be
conceded
between
them
that
bygones
should
be
bygones
she
might
live
with
him
and
do
her
duty
and
at
least
have
her
child
with
her
her
father
had
told
her
that
her
husband
was
mad
but
she
was
willing
to
put
up
with
his
madness
on
such
terms
as
these
what
could
her
husband
do
to
her
in
his
madness
that
he
could
not
do
also
to
the
child
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
say
and
i
will
say
it
she
said
you
have
sinned
against
me
he
said
raising
her
head
gently
from
his
shoulder
never
she
exclaimed
as
god
is
my
judge
i
never
have
as
she
said
this
she
retreated
and
took
the
sobbing
boy
again
into
her
arms
he
was
at
once
placed
upon
his
guard
telling
himself
that
he
saw
the
necessity
of
holding
by
his
child
how
could
he
tell
might
there
not
be
a
policeman
down
from
florence
ready
round
the
house
to
seize
the
boy
and
carry
him
away
though
all
his
remaining
life
should
be
a
torment
to
him
though
infinite
plagues
should
be
poured
upon
his
head
though
he
should
die
like
a
dog
alone
unfriended
and
in
despair
while
he
was
fighting
this
battle
of
his
he
would
not
give
way
that
is
sufficient
he
said
louey
must
return
now
to
his
own
chamber
i
may
go
with
him
no
emily
you
can
not
go
with
him
now
i
will
thank
you
to
release
him
that
i
may
take
him
she
still
held
the
little
fellow
closely
pressed
in
her
arms
do
not
reward
me
for
my
courtesy
by
further
disobedience
he
said
you
will
let
me
come
again
to
this
he
made
no
reply
tell
me
that
i
may
come
again
i
do
not
think
that
i
shall
remain
here
long
and
i
may
not
stay
now
that
would
be
impossible
there
is
no
accommodation
for
you
i
could
sleep
on
the
boards
beside
his
cot
said
trevelyan
that
is
my
place
he
replied
you
may
know
that
he
is
not
disregarded
with
my
own
hands
i
tend
him
every
morning
i
take
him
out
myself
i
feed
him
myself
he
says
his
prayers
to
me
he
learns
from
me
and
can
say
his
letters
nicely
you
need
not
fear
for
him
no
mother
was
ever
more
tender
with
her
child
than
i
am
with
him
then
he
gently
withdrew
the
boy
from
her
arms
and
she
let
her
child
go
lest
he
should
learn
to
know
that
there
was
a
quarrel
between
his
father
and
his
mother
if
you
will
excuse
me
he
said
i
will
not
come
down
to
you
again
my
servant
will
see
you
to
your
carriage
so
he
left
her
and
she
with
an
italian
girl
at
her
heels
got
into
her
vehicle
and
was
taken
back
to
siena
there
she
passed
the
night
alone
at
the
inn
and
on
the
next
morning
returned
to
florence
by
the
railway
chapter
lxxx
will
they
despise
him
gradually
the
news
of
the
intended
marriage
between
glascock
and
miss
spalding
spread
itself
over
florence
and
people
talked
about
it
with
that
energy
which
subjects
of
such
moment
certainly
deserve
that
caroline
spalding
had
achieved
a
very
great
triumph
was
of
course
the
verdict
of
all
men
and
of
all
women
and
i
fear
that
there
was
a
corresponding
feeling
that
poor
glascock
had
been
triumphed
over
and
as
it
were
subjugated
in
some
respects
he
had
been
remiss
in
his
duties
as
a
bachelor
visitor
to
florence
as
a
visitor
to
florence
who
had
manifestly
been
much
in
want
of
a
wife
he
had
not
given
other
girls
a
fair
chance
but
had
thrown
himself
down
at
the
feet
of
this
american
female
in
the
weakest
possible
manner
and
then
it
got
about
the
town
that
he
had
been
refused
over
and
over
again
by
nora
rowley
it
is
too
probable
that
lady
rowley
in
her
despair
and
dismay
had
been
indiscreet
and
had
told
secrets
which
should
never
have
been
mentioned
by
her
and
the
wife
of
the
english
minister
who
had
some
grudges
of
her
own
lifted
her
eyebrows
and
shook
her
head
and
declared
that
all
the
glascocks
at
home
would
be
outraged
to
the
last
degree
my
dear
lady
rowley
she
said
i
do
know
whether
it
wo
become
a
question
with
them
whether
they
should
issue
a
commission
de
lunatico
lady
rowley
did
not
know
what
a
commission
de
lunatico
meant
but
was
quite
willing
to
regard
poor
glascock
as
a
lunatic
and
there
is
poor
lord
peterborough
at
naples
just
at
death
door
continued
the
british
minister
wife
in
this
she
was
perhaps
nearly
correct
but
as
lord
peterborough
had
now
been
in
the
same
condition
for
many
months
as
his
mind
had
altogether
gone
and
as
the
doctor
declared
that
he
might
live
in
his
present
condition
for
a
year
or
for
years
it
could
not
fairly
be
said
that
glascock
was
acting
without
due
filial
feeling
in
engaging
himself
to
marry
a
young
lady
and
she
such
a
creature
said
lady
rowley
with
emphasis
this
the
british
minister
wife
noticed
simply
by
shaking
her
head
caroline
spalding
was
undoubtedly
a
pretty
girl
but
as
the
british
minister
wife
said
afterwards
it
was
not
surprising
that
poor
lady
rowley
should
be
nearly
out
of
her
mind
this
had
occurred
a
full
week
after
the
evening
spent
at
spalding
house
and
even
yet
lady
rowley
had
never
been
put
right
as
to
that
mistake
of
hers
about
wallachia
petrie
that
other
trouble
of
hers
and
her
eldest
daughter
journey
to
siena
had
prevented
them
from
going
out
and
though
the
matter
had
often
been
discussed
between
lady
rowley
and
nora
there
had
not
as
yet
come
between
them
any
proper
explanation
nora
would
declare
that
the
future
bride
was
very
pretty
and
very
delightful
and
lady
rowley
would
throw
up
her
hands
in
despair
and
protest
that
her
daughter
was
insane
why
should
he
not
marry
whom
he
likes
mamma
nora
once
said
almost
with
indignation
because
he
will
disgrace
his
family
i
can
not
understand
what
you
mean
mamma
they
are
at
any
rate
as
good
as
we
are
spalding
stands
quite
as
high
as
papa
does
she
is
an
american
said
lady
rowley
and
her
family
might
say
that
he
is
an
englishman
said
nora
my
dear
if
you
do
not
understand
the
incongruity
between
an
english
peer
and
a
yankee
female
i
can
not
help
you
i
suppose
it
is
because
you
have
been
brought
up
within
the
limited
society
of
a
small
colony
if
so
it
is
not
your
fault
but
i
had
hoped
you
had
been
in
europe
long
enough
to
have
learned
what
was
what
do
you
think
my
dear
that
she
will
look
well
when
she
is
presented
to
her
majesty
as
lord
peterborough
wife
splendid
said
nora
she
has
just
the
brow
for
a
coronet
heavens
and
earth
said
lady
rowley
throwing
up
her
hands
and
you
believe
that
he
will
be
proud
of
her
in
england
i
am
sure
he
will
my
belief
is
that
he
will
leave
her
behind
him
or
that
they
will
settle
somewhere
in
the
wilds
of
america
out
in
mexico
or
massachusetts
or
the
rocky
mountains
i
do
not
think
that
he
will
have
the
courage
to
shew
her
in
london
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
in
the
protestant
church
at
florence
early
in
june
and
then
the
bride
and
bridegroom
were
to
go
over
the
alps
and
to
remain
there
subject
to
tidings
as
to
the
health
of
the
old
man
at
naples
glascock
had
thrown
up
his
seat
in
parliament
some
month
or
two
ago
knowing
that
he
could
not
get
back
to
his
duties
during
the
present
session
and
feeling
that
he
would
shortly
be
called
upon
to
sit
in
the
other
house
he
was
thus
free
to
use
his
time
and
to
fix
his
days
as
he
pleased
and
it
was
certainly
clear
to
those
who
knew
him
that
he
was
not
ashamed
of
his
american
bride
he
spent
much
of
his
time
at
the
spaldings
house
and
was
always
to
be
seen
with
them
in
the
cascine
and
at
the
opera
spalding
the
aunt
was
of
course
in
great
glory
a
triumphant
happy
or
even
simply
a
splendid
marriage
for
the
rising
girl
of
a
family
is
a
great
glory
to
the
maternal
mind
spalding
could
not
but
be
aware
that
the
very
air
around
her
seemed
to
breathe
congratulations
into
her
ears
her
friends
spoke
to
her
even
on
indifferent
subjects
as
though
everything
was
going
well
with
her
better
with
her
than
with
anybody
else
and
there
came
upon
her
in
these
days
a
dangerous
feeling
that
in
spite
of
all
the
preachings
of
the
preachers
the
next
world
might
perhaps
be
not
so
very
much
better
than
this
she
was
in
fact
the
reverse
of
the
medal
of
which
poor
lady
rowley
filled
the
obverse
and
the
american
minister
was
certainly
an
inch
taller
than
before
and
made
longer
speeches
being
much
more
regardless
of
interruption
olivia
was
delighted
at
her
sister
success
and
heard
with
rapture
the
description
of
monkhams
which
came
to
her
through
her
sister
it
was
already
settled
that
she
was
to
spend
her
next
christmas
at
monkhams
and
perhaps
there
might
be
an
idea
in
her
mind
that
there
were
other
eldest
sons
of
old
lords
who
would
like
american
brides
everything
around
caroline
spalding
was
pleasant
except
the
words
of
wallachia
petrie
everything
around
her
was
pleasant
till
there
came
to
her
a
touch
of
a
suspicion
that
the
marriage
which
glascock
was
going
to
make
would
be
detrimental
to
her
intended
husband
in
his
own
country
there
were
many
in
florence
who
were
saying
this
besides
the
wife
of
the
english
minister
and
lady
rowley
of
course
caroline
spalding
herself
was
the
last
to
hear
it
and
to
her
the
idea
was
brought
by
wallachia
petrie
i
wish
i
could
think
you
would
make
yourself
happy
or
him
wallachia
had
said
croaking
why
should
i
fail
to
make
him
happy
because
you
are
not
of
the
same
blood
or
race
or
manners
as
himself
they
say
that
he
is
very
wealthy
in
his
own
country
and
that
those
who
live
around
him
will
look
coldly
on
you
so
that
he
does
not
look
coldly
i
do
not
care
how
others
may
look
said
caroline
proudly
but
when
he
finds
that
he
has
injured
himself
by
such
a
marriage
in
the
estimation
of
all
his
friends
how
will
it
be
then
this
set
caroline
spalding
thinking
of
what
she
was
doing
she
began
to
realise
the
feeling
that
perhaps
she
might
not
be
a
fit
bride
for
an
english
lord
son
and
in
her
agony
she
came
to
nora
rowley
for
counsel
after
all
how
little
was
it
that
she
knew
of
the
home
and
the
country
to
which
she
was
to
be
carried
she
might
not
perhaps
get
adequate
advice
from
nora
but
she
would
probably
learn
something
on
which
she
could
act
there
was
no
one
else
among
the
english
at
florence
to
whom
she
could
speak
with
freedom
when
she
mentioned
her
fears
to
her
aunt
her
aunt
of
course
laughed
at
her
spalding
told
her
that
glascock
might
be
presumed
to
know
his
own
business
best
and
that
she
as
an
american
lady
of
high
standing
the
niece
of
a
minister
was
a
fitting
match
for
any
englishman
let
him
be
ever
so
much
a
lord
but
caroline
was
not
comforted
by
this
and
in
her
suspense
she
went
to
nora
rowley
she
wrote
a
line
to
nora
and
when
she
called
at
the
hotel
was
taken
up
to
her
friend
she
found
great
difficulty
in
telling
her
story
but
she
did
tell
it
miss
rowley
she
said
if
this
is
a
silly
thing
that
he
is
going
to
do
i
am
bound
to
save
him
from
his
own
folly
you
know
your
own
country
better
than
i
do
will
they
think
that
he
has
disgraced
himself
certainly
not
that
said
nora
shall
i
be
a
load
round
his
neck
miss
rowley
for
my
own
sake
i
would
not
endure
such
a
position
as
that
not
even
though
i
love
him
but
for
his
sake
think
of
that
if
i
find
that
people
think
ill
of
him
because
of
me
no
one
will
think
ill
of
him
is
it
esteemed
needful
that
such
a
one
as
he
should
marry
a
woman
of
his
own
rank
i
can
bear
to
end
it
all
now
but
i
shall
not
be
able
to
bear
his
humiliation
and
my
own
despair
if
i
find
that
i
have
injured
him
tell
me
plainly
is
it
a
marriage
that
he
should
not
make
nora
paused
for
a
while
before
she
answered
and
as
she
sat
silent
the
other
girl
watched
her
face
carefully
nora
on
being
thus
consulted
was
very
careful
that
her
tongue
should
utter
nothing
that
was
not
her
true
opinion
as
best
she
knew
how
to
express
it
her
sympathy
would
have
prompted
her
to
give
such
an
answer
as
would
at
once
have
made
caroline
happy
in
her
mind
she
would
have
been
delighted
to
have
been
able
to
declare
that
these
doubts
were
utterly
groundless
and
this
hesitation
needless
but
she
conceived
that
she
owed
it
as
a
duty
from
one
woman
to
another
to
speak
the
truth
as
she
conceived
it
on
so
momentous
an
occasion
and
she
was
not
sure
but
that
glascock
would
be
considered
by
his
friends
in
england
to
be
doing
badly
in
marrying
an
american
girl
what
she
did
not
remember
was
this
that
her
very
hesitation
was
in
fact
an
answer
and
such
an
answer
as
she
was
most
unwilling
to
give
i
see
that
it
would
be
so
said
caroline
spalding
no
not
that
what
then
will
they
despise
him
and
me
no
one
who
knows
you
can
despise
you
no
one
who
sees
you
can
fail
to
admire
you
nora
as
she
said
this
thought
of
her
mother
but
told
herself
at
once
that
in
this
matter
her
mother
judgment
had
been
altogether
destroyed
by
her
disappointment
what
i
think
will
take
place
will
be
this
his
family
when
first
they
hear
of
it
will
be
sorry
then
said
caroline
i
will
put
an
end
to
it
you
ca
do
that
dear
you
are
engaged
and
you
have
a
right
i
am
engaged
to
a
man
and
all
my
friends
object
to
it
but
i
put
an
end
to
it
i
do
think
i
have
a
right
i
shall
not
do
it
any
way
however
but
if
it
were
for
his
good
it
could
be
for
his
good
he
and
i
have
got
to
go
along
together
somehow
you
would
hurt
him
said
caroline
i
wo
if
i
can
help
it
but
he
has
got
to
take
me
along
with
him
any
how
and
glascock
has
got
to
take
you
if
i
were
you
i
should
ask
any
more
questions
it
is
the
same
you
said
that
you
were
to
be
poor
but
he
is
very
rich
and
i
am
beginning
to
understand
that
these
titles
of
yours
are
something
like
kings
crowns
the
man
who
has
to
wear
them
ca
do
just
as
he
pleases
with
them
noblesse
oblige
i
can
see
the
meaning
of
that
even
when
the
obligation
itself
is
trumpery
in
its
nature
if
it
is
a
man
duty
to
marry
a
talbot
because
he
a
howard
i
suppose
he
ought
to
do
his
duty
after
a
pause
she
went
on
again
i
do
believe
that
i
have
made
a
mistake
it
seemed
to
be
absurd
at
the
first
to
think
of
it
but
i
do
believe
it
now
even
what
you
say
to
me
makes
me
think
it
at
any
rate
you
ca
go
back
said
nora
enthusiastically
i
will
try
go
to
himself
and
ask
him
you
must
leave
him
to
decide
it
at
last
i
do
see
how
a
girl
when
she
is
engaged
is
to
throw
a
man
over
unless
he
consents
of
course
you
can
throw
yourself
into
the
arno
and
get
the
water
into
my
shoes
for
it
would
do
much
more
at
present
and
you
can
jilt
him
said
nora
it
would
not
be
jilting
him
he
must
decide
that
if
he
so
regards
it
it
will
be
so
i
advise
you
to
think
no
more
about
it
but
if
you
speak
to
anybody
it
should
be
to
him
this
was
at
last
the
result
of
nora
wisdom
and
then
the
two
girls
descended
together
to
the
room
in
which
lady
rowley
was
sitting
with
her
other
daughters
lady
rowley
was
very
careful
in
asking
after
miss
spalding
sister
and
miss
spalding
assured
her
that
olivia
was
quite
well
then
lady
rowley
made
some
inquiry
about
olivia
and
glascock
and
miss
spalding
assured
her
that
no
two
persons
were
ever
such
allies
and
that
she
believed
that
they
were
together
at
this
moment
investigating
some
old
church
lady
rowley
simpered
and
declared
that
nothing
could
be
more
proper
and
expressed
a
hope
that
olivia
would
like
england
caroline
spalding
having
still
in
her
mind
the
trouble
that
had
brought
her
to
nora
had
not
much
to
say
about
this
if
she
goes
again
to
england
i
am
sure
she
will
like
it
replied
miss
spalding
but
of
course
she
is
going
said
lady
rowley
of
course
she
will
some
day
and
of
course
she
like
it
said
miss
spalding
we
both
of
us
have
been
there
already
but
i
mean
monkhams
said
lady
rowley
still
simpering
i
declare
i
believe
mamma
thinks
that
your
sister
is
to
be
married
to
mr
glascock
said
lucy
and
so
she
is
is
she
said
lady
rowley
oh
mamma
said
nora
jumping
up
it
is
caroline
this
one
this
one
this
one
and
nora
took
her
friend
by
the
arm
as
she
spoke
it
is
this
one
that
is
to
be
mrs
glascock
it
is
a
most
natural
mistake
to
make
said
caroline
lady
rowley
became
very
red
in
the
face
and
was
unhappy
i
declare
she
said
that
they
told
me
it
was
your
elder
sister
but
i
have
no
elder
sister
said
caroline
laughing
of
course
she
is
oldest
said
nora
and
looks
to
be
so
ever
so
much
do
you
miss
spalding
i
have
always
supposed
so
i
do
understand
it
at
all
said
lady
rowley
who
had
no
image
before
her
mind
eye
but
that
of
wallachia
petrie
and
who
was
beginning
to
feel
that
she
had
disgraced
her
own
judgment
by
the
criticisms
she
had
expressed
everywhere
as
to
glascock
bride
i
do
understand
it
at
all
do
you
mean
that
both
your
sisters
are
younger
than
you
miss
spalding
i
have
only
got
one
lady
rowley
mamma
you
are
thinking
of
miss
petrie
said
nora
clapping
both
her
hands
together
i
mean
the
lady
that
wears
the
black
bugles
of
course
you
do
miss
petrie
mamma
has
all
along
thought
that
glascock
was
going
to
carry
away
with
him
the
republican
browning
oh
mamma
how
can
you
have
made
such
a
blunder
said
sophie
rowley
mamma
does
make
such
delicious
blunders
sophie
my
dear
that
is
not
a
proper
way
of
speaking
but
dear
mamma
do
you
if
somebody
has
told
me
wrong
that
has
not
been
my
fault
said
lady
rowley
the
poor
woman
was
so
evidently
disconcerted
that
caroline
spalding
was
quite
unhappy
my
dear
lady
rowley
there
has
been
no
fault
and
why
should
it
have
been
so
wallachia
is
so
clever
that
it
is
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
have
thought
i
can
not
say
that
i
agree
with
you
there
said
lady
rowley
somewhat
recovering
herself
you
must
know
the
whole
truth
now
said
nora
turning
to
her
friend
and
you
must
not
be
angry
with
us
if
we
laugh
a
little
at
your
poetess
mamma
has
been
frantic
with
glascock
because
he
has
been
going
to
marry
whom
shall
i
say
her
edition
of
you
she
has
sworn
that
he
must
be
insane
when
we
have
sworn
how
beautiful
you
were
and
how
nice
and
how
jolly
and
all
the
rest
of
it
she
has
sworn
that
you
were
at
least
a
hundred
and
that
you
had
a
red
nose
you
must
admit
that
miss
petrie
has
a
red
nose
is
that
a
sin
not
at
all
in
the
woman
who
has
it
but
in
the
man
who
is
going
to
marry
it
yes
ca
you
see
how
we
have
all
been
at
and
what
mamma
has
been
thinking
and
saying
of
poor
glascock
you
must
repeat
it
of
course
but
we
have
had
such
a
battle
here
about
it
we
thought
that
mamma
had
lost
her
eyes
and
her
ears
and
her
knowledge
of
things
in
general
and
now
it
has
all
come
out
you
wo
be
angry
why
should
i
be
angry
miss
spalding
said
lady
rowley
i
am
really
unhappy
at
what
has
occurred
and
i
hope
that
there
may
be
nothing
more
said
about
it
i
am
quite
sure
that
somebody
told
me
wrong
or
i
should
not
have
fallen
into
such
an
error
i
beg
your
pardon
and
mr
glascock
beg
glascock
pardon
certainly
said
lucy
miss
spalding
looked
very
pretty
smiled
very
gracefully
and
coming
up
to
lady
rowley
to
say
kissed
her
on
her
cheeks
this
overcame
the
spirit
of
the
disappointed
mother
and
lady
rowley
never
said
another
word
against
caroline
spalding
or
her
marriage
now
mamma
what
do
you
think
of
her
said
nora
as
soon
as
caroline
was
gone
was
it
odd
my
dear
that
i
should
be
astonished
at
his
wanting
to
marry
that
other
woman
but
mamma
when
we
told
you
that
she
was
young
and
pretty
and
bright
i
thought
that
you
were
all
demented
i
did
indeed
i
still
think
it
a
pity
that
he
should
take
an
american
i
think
that
miss
spalding
is
very
nice
but
there
are
english
girls
quite
as
as
her
after
that
there
was
not
another
word
said
by
lady
rowley
against
caroline
spalding
nora
when
she
thought
of
it
all
that
night
felt
that
she
had
hardly
spoken
to
miss
spalding
as
she
should
have
spoken
as
to
the
treatment
in
england
which
would
be
accorded
to
glascock
wife
she
became
aware
of
the
effect
which
her
own
hesitation
must
have
had
and
thought
that
it
was
her
duty
to
endeavour
to
remove
it
perhaps
too
the
conversion
of
her
mother
had
some
effect
in
making
her
feel
that
she
had
been
wrong
in
supposing
that
there
would
be
any
difficulty
in
caroline
position
in
england
she
had
heard
so
much
adverse
criticism
from
her
mother
that
she
had
doubted
in
spite
of
her
own
convictions
but
now
it
had
come
to
light
that
lady
rowley
criticisms
had
all
come
from
a
most
absurd
blunder
only
fancy
she
said
to
herself
miss
petrie
coming
out
as
lady
peterborough
poor
mamma
and
then
she
thought
of
the
reception
which
would
be
given
to
caroline
and
of
the
place
the
future
lady
peterborough
would
fill
in
the
world
and
of
the
glories
of
monkhams
resolving
that
she
would
do
her
best
to
counteract
any
evil
which
she
might
have
done
she
seated
herself
at
her
desk
and
wrote
the
following
letter
to
miss
spalding
my
dear
caroline
i
am
sure
you
will
let
me
call
you
so
as
had
you
not
felt
towards
me
like
a
friend
you
would
not
have
come
to
me
and
told
me
of
your
doubts
i
think
that
i
did
not
answer
you
as
i
ought
to
have
done
when
you
spoke
to
me
i
did
not
like
to
say
anything
and
in
that
way
i
misled
you
i
feel
quite
sure
that
you
will
encounter
nothing
in
england
as
glascock
wife
to
make
you
uncomfortable
and
that
he
will
have
nothing
to
repent
of
course
englishmen
generally
marry
englishwomen
and
perhaps
there
may
be
some
people
who
will
think
that
such
a
prize
should
not
be
lost
to
their
countrywomen
but
that
will
be
all
glascock
commands
such
universal
respect
that
his
wife
will
certainly
be
respected
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
anything
will
ever
come
in
your
way
that
can
possibly
make
you
feel
that
he
is
looked
down
upon
i
hope
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
as
for
your
changing
now
that
is
quite
impossible
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
say
a
word
about
it
to
any
living
being
but
just
go
on
straight
forward
in
your
own
way
and
take
the
good
the
gods
provide
you
as
the
poet
says
to
the
king
in
the
ode
and
i
think
the
gods
have
provided
for
you
very
well
and
for
him
i
do
hope
that
i
may
see
you
sometimes
i
can
not
explain
to
you
how
very
much
out
of
your
line
we
shall
be
for
of
course
there
is
a
we
people
are
more
separated
with
us
than
they
are
i
suppose
with
you
and
my
we
is
a
very
poor
man
who
works
hard
at
writing
in
a
dingy
newspaper
office
and
we
shall
live
in
a
garret
and
have
brown
sugar
in
our
tea
and
eat
hashed
mutton
and
i
shall
have
nothing
a
year
to
buy
my
clothes
with
still
i
mean
to
do
it
and
i
do
mean
to
be
long
before
i
do
do
it
when
a
girl
has
made
up
her
mind
to
be
married
she
had
better
go
on
with
it
at
once
and
take
it
all
afterwards
as
it
may
come
nevertheless
perhaps
we
may
see
each
other
somewhere
and
i
may
be
able
to
introduce
you
to
the
dearest
honestest
very
best
and
most
affectionate
man
in
the
world
and
he
is
very
very
clever
yours
very
affectionately
nora
rowley
thursday
morning
chapter
lxxxi
glascock
is
master
illustration
caroline
spalding
when
she
received
nora
letter
was
not
disposed
to
give
much
weight
to
it
she
declared
to
herself
that
the
unpremeditated
expression
of
opinion
was
worth
more
than
her
studied
words
but
she
was
not
the
less
grateful
or
the
less
loving
towards
her
new
friend
she
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
to
have
nora
at
that
splendid
abode
in
england
of
which
she
had
heard
so
much
but
she
thought
also
that
in
that
splendid
abode
she
herself
ought
never
to
have
part
or
share
if
it
were
the
case
that
this
were
an
unfitting
match
it
was
clearly
her
duty
to
decide
that
there
should
be
no
marriage
nora
had
been
quite
right
in
bidding
her
speak
to
glascock
himself
and
to
glascock
she
would
go
but
it
was
very
difficult
for
her
to
determine
on
the
manner
in
which
she
would
discuss
the
subject
with
him
she
thought
that
she
could
be
firm
if
her
mind
were
once
made
up
she
believed
that
perhaps
she
was
by
nature
more
firm
than
he
in
all
their
intercourse
together
he
had
ever
yielded
to
her
and
though
she
had
been
always
pleased
and
grateful
there
had
grown
upon
her
an
idea
that
he
was
perhaps
too
easy
that
he
was
a
man
as
to
whom
it
was
necessary
that
they
who
loved
him
should
see
that
he
was
not
led
away
by
weakness
into
folly
but
she
would
want
to
learn
something
from
him
before
her
decision
was
finally
reached
and
in
this
she
foresaw
a
great
difficulty
in
her
trouble
she
went
to
her
usual
counsellor
the
republican
browning
in
such
an
emergency
she
could
hardly
have
done
worse
wally
she
said
we
talk
about
england
and
italy
and
france
as
though
we
knew
all
about
them
but
how
hard
it
is
to
realise
the
difference
between
one
own
country
and
others
we
can
at
least
learn
a
great
deal
that
is
satisfactory
said
wallachia
about
one
out
of
every
five
italians
can
read
a
book
about
two
out
of
every
five
englishmen
can
read
a
book
out
of
every
five
new
englanders
four
and
can
read
a
book
i
guess
that
is
knowing
a
good
deal
i
do
mean
in
statistics
i
can
not
conceive
how
you
are
to
learn
anything
about
any
country
except
by
statistics
i
have
just
discovered
that
the
number
of
illegitimate
children
oh
wally
i
ca
talk
about
that
not
now
at
least
what
i
can
not
realise
is
this
what
sort
of
a
life
it
is
that
they
will
lead
at
monkhams
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
i
guess
and
you
always
have
to
go
round
in
fine
clothes
and
that
will
be
all
no
not
all
there
will
be
carriages
and
horses
and
all
manner
of
people
there
who
wo
care
much
about
you
if
he
is
firm
very
firm
if
he
have
that
firmness
which
one
does
not
often
meet
even
in
an
american
man
he
will
be
able
after
a
while
to
give
you
a
position
as
an
english
woman
of
rank
it
is
to
be
feared
that
wallachia
petrie
had
been
made
aware
of
caroline
idea
as
to
glascock
want
of
purpose
and
that
will
be
all
if
you
have
a
baby
they
let
you
go
and
see
it
two
or
three
times
a
day
i
do
suppose
you
will
be
allowed
to
nurse
it
because
they
never
do
in
england
you
have
read
what
the
saturday
review
says
in
every
other
respect
the
saturday
review
has
been
the
falsest
of
all
false
periodicals
but
i
guess
it
has
been
pretty
true
in
what
it
has
said
about
english
women
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
it
really
when
a
man
has
to
leap
through
a
window
in
the
dark
caroline
of
course
he
doubts
whether
the
feather
bed
said
to
be
below
will
be
soft
enough
for
him
i
should
fear
the
leap
for
myself
if
it
would
hurt
him
do
you
think
it
possible
that
society
can
be
so
formed
that
a
man
should
lose
caste
because
he
does
marry
just
one
of
his
own
set
it
has
been
so
all
over
the
world
my
dear
if
like
to
like
is
to
be
true
anywhere
it
should
be
true
in
marriage
yes
but
with
a
difference
he
and
i
are
like
to
like
we
come
of
the
same
race
we
speak
the
same
language
we
worship
the
same
god
we
have
the
same
ideas
of
culture
and
of
pleasures
the
difference
is
one
that
is
not
patent
to
the
eye
or
to
the
ear
it
is
a
difference
of
accidental
incident
not
of
nature
or
of
acquirement
i
guess
you
would
find
caroline
that
a
jury
of
english
matrons
sworn
to
try
you
fairly
would
not
find
you
to
be
entitled
to
come
among
them
as
one
of
themselves
and
how
will
that
affect
him
less
powerfully
than
many
others
because
he
is
not
impassioned
he
is
perhaps
lethargic
no
wally
he
is
not
lethargic
if
you
ask
me
i
must
speak
it
would
harass
some
men
almost
to
death
it
will
not
do
so
with
him
he
would
probably
find
his
happiness
best
in
leaving
his
old
country
and
coming
among
your
people
the
idea
of
glascock
the
future
lord
peterborough
leaving
england
abandoning
monkhams
deserting
his
duty
in
the
house
of
lords
and
going
away
to
live
in
an
american
town
in
order
that
he
might
escape
the
miseries
which
his
wife
had
brought
upon
him
in
his
own
country
was
more
than
caroline
could
bear
she
knew
that
at
any
rate
it
would
not
come
to
that
the
lord
of
monkhams
would
live
at
monkhams
though
the
heavens
should
fall
in
regard
to
domestic
comforts
it
was
clear
to
caroline
that
wallachia
petrie
had
in
truth
never
brought
home
to
her
own
imagination
the
position
of
an
english
peer
i
do
think
you
understand
the
people
at
all
she
said
angrily
you
think
that
you
can
understand
them
better
because
you
are
engaged
to
this
man
said
miss
petrie
with
irony
you
have
found
generally
that
when
the
sun
shines
in
your
eyes
your
sight
is
improved
by
it
you
think
that
the
of
a
few
weeks
gives
clearer
instruction
than
the
laborious
reading
of
many
volumes
and
thoughtful
converse
with
thinking
persons
i
hope
that
you
may
find
it
so
caroline
so
saying
wallachia
petrie
walked
off
in
great
dudgeon
miss
petrie
not
having
learned
from
her
many
volumes
and
her
much
converse
with
thoughtful
persons
to
read
human
nature
aright
was
convinced
by
this
conversation
that
her
friend
caroline
was
blind
to
all
results
and
was
determined
to
go
on
with
this
dangerous
marriage
having
the
rays
of
that
sun
of
monkhams
so
full
upon
her
eyes
that
she
could
not
see
at
all
she
was
specially
indignant
at
finding
that
her
own
words
had
no
effect
but
unfortunately
her
words
had
had
much
effect
and
caroline
though
she
had
contested
her
points
had
done
so
only
with
the
intention
of
producing
her
admonitions
of
course
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
glascock
should
go
and
live
in
providence
rhode
island
from
which
thriving
town
caroline
spalding
had
come
but
because
that
was
impossible
it
was
not
the
less
probable
that
he
might
be
degraded
and
made
miserable
in
his
own
home
that
suggested
jury
of
british
matrons
was
a
frightful
conclave
to
contemplate
and
caroline
was
disposed
to
believe
that
the
verdict
given
in
reference
to
herself
would
be
adverse
to
her
so
she
sat
and
meditated
and
spoke
not
a
word
further
to
any
one
on
the
subject
till
she
was
alone
with
the
man
that
she
loved
spalding
at
this
time
inhabited
the
ground
floor
of
a
large
palace
in
the
city
from
which
there
was
access
to
a
garden
which
at
this
period
of
the
year
was
green
bright
and
shady
and
which
as
being
in
the
centre
of
a
city
was
large
and
luxurious
from
one
end
of
the
house
there
projected
a
covered
terrace
or
loggia
in
which
there
were
chairs
and
tables
sculptured
ornaments
busts
and
old
monumental
relics
let
into
the
wall
in
profusion
it
was
half
chamber
and
half
garden
such
an
adjunct
to
a
house
as
in
our
climate
would
give
only
an
idea
of
cold
rheumatism
and
a
false
romance
but
under
an
italian
sky
is
a
luxury
daily
to
be
enjoyed
during
most
months
of
the
year
here
glascock
and
caroline
had
passed
many
hours
and
here
they
were
now
seated
late
in
the
evening
while
all
others
of
the
family
were
away
as
far
as
regarded
the
rooms
occupied
by
the
american
minister
they
had
the
house
and
garden
to
themselves
and
there
never
could
come
a
time
more
appropriate
for
the
saying
of
a
thing
difficult
to
be
said
glascock
had
heard
from
his
physician
and
had
said
that
it
was
nearly
certain
now
that
he
need
not
go
down
to
naples
again
before
his
marriage
caroline
was
trembling
not
knowing
how
to
speak
not
knowing
how
to
begin
but
resolved
that
the
thing
should
be
done
he
will
never
know
you
carry
said
glascock
it
is
perhaps
hardly
a
sorrow
to
me
but
it
is
a
regret
it
would
have
been
a
sorrow
perhaps
to
him
had
he
been
able
to
know
me
said
she
taking
the
opportunity
of
rushing
at
her
subject
why
so
of
all
human
beings
he
was
the
not
than
you
charles
but
soft
hearts
have
to
be
hardened
what
do
you
mean
am
i
becoming
obdurate
i
am
charles
she
said
i
have
got
something
to
say
to
you
what
will
your
uncles
and
aunts
and
your
mother
relations
say
of
me
when
they
see
me
at
monkhams
they
will
swear
to
me
that
you
are
charming
and
then
when
my
back
is
turned
they
pick
you
to
pieces
a
little
among
themselves
i
believe
that
is
the
way
of
the
world
and
i
do
suppose
that
we
are
to
do
better
than
others
and
if
you
had
married
an
english
girl
a
lady
augusta
somebody
would
they
pick
her
to
pieces
i
guess
they
would
as
you
say
just
the
same
i
do
think
anybody
escapes
as
far
as
i
can
see
but
that
prevent
their
becoming
your
bosom
friends
in
a
few
weeks
time
no
one
will
say
that
you
have
been
wrong
to
marry
an
american
girl
now
carry
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
do
you
know
any
man
in
your
position
who
ever
did
marry
an
american
girl
any
man
of
your
rank
in
england
glascock
began
to
think
of
the
case
and
could
not
at
the
moment
remember
any
instance
charles
i
do
not
think
you
ought
to
be
the
first
and
yet
somebody
must
be
first
if
the
thing
is
ever
to
be
done
and
i
am
too
old
to
wait
on
the
chance
of
being
the
second
she
felt
that
at
the
rate
she
was
now
progressing
she
would
only
run
from
one
little
suggestion
to
another
and
that
he
either
wilfully
or
in
sheer
simplicity
would
take
such
suggestions
simply
as
jokes
and
she
was
aware
that
she
lacked
the
skill
to
bring
the
conversation
round
gradually
to
the
point
which
she
was
bound
to
reach
she
must
make
another
dash
let
it
be
ever
so
sudden
her
mode
of
doing
so
would
be
crude
ugly
almost
vulgar
she
feared
but
she
would
attain
her
object
and
say
what
she
had
to
say
when
once
she
had
warmed
herself
with
the
heat
which
argument
would
produce
then
she
was
pretty
sure
she
would
find
herself
at
least
as
strong
as
he
i
do
know
that
the
thing
ought
to
be
done
at
all
she
said
during
the
last
moment
or
two
he
had
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
she
not
choosing
to
bid
him
desist
from
embracing
her
but
unwilling
in
her
present
mood
to
be
embraced
got
up
and
stood
before
him
i
have
thought
and
thought
and
thought
and
feel
that
it
should
not
be
done
in
marriage
like
should
go
to
like
she
despised
herself
for
using
wallachia
words
but
they
fitted
in
so
usefully
that
she
could
not
refrain
from
them
i
was
wrong
not
to
know
it
before
but
it
is
better
to
know
it
now
than
not
to
have
known
it
till
too
late
everything
that
i
hear
and
see
tells
me
that
it
would
be
so
if
you
were
simply
an
englishman
i
would
go
anywhere
with
you
but
i
am
not
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
an
english
lord
the
time
would
come
when
i
should
be
a
disgrace
to
you
and
then
i
should
die
i
think
i
should
go
near
dying
myself
said
he
if
you
were
a
disgrace
to
me
he
had
not
risen
from
his
chair
and
sat
calmly
looking
up
into
her
face
we
have
made
a
mistake
and
let
us
unmake
it
she
continued
i
will
always
be
your
friend
i
will
correspond
with
you
i
will
come
and
see
your
wife
that
will
be
very
kind
charles
if
you
laugh
at
me
i
shall
be
angry
with
you
it
is
right
that
you
should
look
to
your
future
life
as
it
is
right
that
i
should
do
so
also
do
you
think
that
i
am
joking
do
you
suppose
that
i
do
not
mean
it
you
have
taken
an
extra
dose
this
morning
of
wallachia
petrie
and
of
course
you
mean
it
if
you
think
that
i
am
speaking
her
mind
and
not
my
own
you
do
not
know
me
and
what
is
it
you
propose
he
said
still
keeping
his
seat
and
looking
calmly
up
into
her
face
simply
that
our
engagement
should
be
over
and
why
because
it
is
not
a
fitting
one
for
you
to
have
made
i
did
not
understand
it
before
but
now
i
do
it
will
not
be
good
for
you
to
marry
an
american
girl
it
will
not
add
to
your
happiness
and
may
destroy
it
i
have
learned
at
last
to
know
how
much
higher
is
your
position
than
mine
and
i
am
to
be
supposed
to
know
nothing
about
it
your
fault
is
only
this
that
you
have
been
too
generous
i
can
be
generous
also
now
look
here
caroline
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
if
on
such
a
subject
i
speak
plainly
you
must
not
even
be
angry
if
i
laugh
a
little
pray
do
not
laugh
at
me
not
now
i
must
a
little
carry
why
am
i
to
be
supposed
to
be
so
ignorant
of
what
concerns
my
own
happiness
and
my
own
duties
if
you
will
not
sit
down
i
will
get
up
and
we
will
take
a
turn
together
he
rose
from
his
seat
but
they
did
not
leave
the
covered
terrace
they
moved
on
to
the
extremity
and
then
he
stood
hemming
her
in
against
a
marble
table
in
the
corner
in
making
this
rather
wild
proposition
have
you
considered
me
at
all
i
have
endeavoured
to
consider
you
and
you
only
and
how
have
you
done
it
by
the
aid
of
some
misty
ideas
respecting
english
society
for
which
you
have
no
basis
except
your
own
dreams
and
by
the
fantasies
of
a
rabid
enthusiast
she
is
not
rabid
said
caroline
earnestly
other
people
think
just
the
same
my
dear
there
is
only
one
person
whose
thinking
on
this
subject
is
of
any
avail
and
i
am
that
person
of
course
i
ca
drag
you
into
church
to
be
married
but
practically
you
can
not
help
yourself
from
being
taken
there
now
as
there
need
be
no
question
about
our
marriage
which
is
a
thing
as
good
as
done
it
is
not
done
at
all
said
caroline
i
feel
quite
satisfied
you
will
not
jilt
me
and
as
i
shall
insist
on
having
the
ceremony
performed
i
choose
to
regard
it
as
a
certainty
passing
that
by
then
i
will
go
on
to
the
results
my
uncles
and
aunts
and
cousins
and
the
people
you
talk
of
were
very
reasonable
folk
when
i
last
saw
them
and
quite
sufficiently
alive
to
the
fact
that
they
had
to
regard
me
as
the
head
of
their
family
i
do
not
doubt
that
we
shall
find
them
equally
reasonable
when
we
get
home
but
should
they
be
changed
should
there
be
any
sign
shewn
that
my
choice
of
a
wife
had
occasioned
displeasure
such
displeasure
would
not
affect
you
but
it
would
affect
you
not
at
all
in
my
own
house
i
am
master
and
i
mean
to
continue
to
be
so
you
will
be
mistress
there
and
the
only
fear
touching
such
a
position
is
that
it
may
be
recognised
by
others
too
strongly
you
have
nothing
to
fear
carry
it
is
of
you
i
am
thinking
nor
have
i
what
if
some
old
women
or
even
some
young
women
should
turn
up
their
noses
at
the
wife
i
have
chosen
because
she
has
not
been
chosen
from
among
their
own
countrywomen
is
that
to
be
a
cause
of
suffering
to
us
can
not
we
rise
above
that
lasting
as
it
would
do
for
a
few
weeks
a
month
or
two
perhaps
say
a
year
till
my
caroline
shall
have
made
herself
known
i
think
that
we
are
strong
enough
to
live
down
a
trouble
so
light
he
had
come
close
to
her
as
he
was
speaking
and
had
again
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
tried
to
escape
from
his
embrace
not
with
persistency
not
with
the
strength
which
always
suffices
for
a
woman
when
the
embrace
is
in
truth
a
thing
to
be
avoided
but
clutching
at
his
fingers
with
hers
pressing
them
rather
than
loosening
their
grasp
no
carry
he
continued
we
have
got
to
go
through
with
it
now
and
we
will
try
and
make
the
best
of
it
you
may
trust
me
that
we
shall
not
find
it
difficult
not
at
least
on
the
ground
of
your
present
fears
i
can
bear
a
heavier
burden
than
you
will
bring
upon
me
i
know
that
i
ought
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
right
she
said
still
struggling
with
his
hand
and
i
know
that
you
can
prove
nothing
of
the
kind
dearest
it
is
fixed
between
us
now
and
do
not
let
us
be
so
silly
as
to
raise
imaginary
difficulties
of
course
you
would
have
to
marry
me
even
if
there
were
cause
for
such
fears
if
there
were
any
great
cause
still
the
game
would
be
worth
the
candle
there
could
be
no
going
back
let
the
fear
be
what
it
might
but
there
need
be
no
fear
if
you
will
only
love
me
she
felt
that
he
was
altogether
too
strong
for
her
that
she
had
mistaken
his
character
in
supposing
that
she
could
be
more
firm
than
he
he
was
so
strong
that
he
treated
her
almost
as
a
child
and
yet
she
loved
him
infinitely
the
better
for
so
treating
her
of
course
she
knew
now
that
her
objection
whether
true
or
unsubstantial
could
not
avail
as
he
stood
with
his
arm
round
her
she
was
powerless
to
contradict
him
in
anything
she
had
so
far
acknowledged
this
that
she
no
longer
struggled
with
him
but
allowed
her
hand
to
remain
quietly
within
his
if
there
was
no
going
back
from
this
bargain
that
had
been
made
why
then
there
was
no
need
for
combating
and
when
he
stooped
over
and
kissed
her
lips
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
be
good
to
me
he
said
and
tell
me
that
i
am
right
you
must
be
master
i
suppose
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
a
man
always
thinks
himself
entitled
to
his
own
way
why
yes
when
he
has
won
the
battle
he
claims
his
captive
now
the
truth
is
this
i
have
won
the
battle
and
your
friend
miss
petrie
has
lost
it
i
hope
she
will
understand
that
she
has
been
beaten
at
last
out
of
the
field
as
he
said
this
he
heard
a
step
behind
them
and
turning
round
saw
wallachia
there
almost
before
he
could
drop
his
arm
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
intruded
on
you
she
said
very
grimly
not
in
the
least
said
glascock
caroline
and
i
have
had
a
little
dispute
but
we
have
settled
it
without
coming
to
blows
i
do
not
suppose
that
an
english
gentleman
ever
absolutely
strikes
a
lady
said
wallachia
petrie
not
except
on
strong
provocation
said
glascock
in
reference
to
wives
a
stick
is
allowed
as
big
as
your
thumb
i
have
heard
that
it
is
so
by
the
laws
of
england
said
wallachia
how
can
you
be
so
ridiculous
wally
said
caroline
there
is
nothing
that
you
would
not
believe
i
hope
that
it
may
never
be
true
in
your
case
said
wallachia
a
couple
of
days
after
this
miss
spalding
found
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
explain
the
circumstances
of
her
position
to
nora
she
had
left
nora
with
the
purpose
of
performing
a
very
action
of
sacrificing
herself
for
the
sake
of
her
lover
of
giving
up
all
her
golden
prospects
and
of
becoming
once
again
the
bosom
friend
of
wallachia
petrie
with
this
simple
consolation
for
her
future
life
that
she
had
refused
to
marry
an
english
nobleman
because
the
english
nobleman
condition
was
unsuited
to
her
it
would
have
been
an
episode
in
female
life
in
which
pride
might
be
taken
but
all
that
was
now
changed
she
had
made
her
little
attempt
had
made
it
as
she
felt
in
a
very
languid
manner
and
had
found
herself
treated
as
a
child
for
doing
so
of
course
she
was
happy
in
her
ill
success
of
course
she
would
have
been
had
she
succeeded
but
nevertheless
she
was
somewhat
lowered
in
her
own
esteem
and
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
acknowledge
the
truth
to
the
friend
whom
she
had
consulted
a
day
or
two
had
passed
before
she
found
herself
alone
with
nora
but
when
she
did
so
she
confessed
her
failure
at
once
you
told
him
all
then
said
nora
oh
yes
i
told
him
all
that
is
i
could
not
really
tell
him
when
the
moment
came
i
had
no
words
and
what
did
he
say
he
had
words
enough
i
never
knew
him
to
be
eloquent
before
he
can
speak
out
if
he
likes
said
nora
so
i
have
found
with
a
vengeance
nobody
was
ever
so
put
down
as
i
was
do
you
know
that
there
are
times
when
it
does
not
seem
to
be
worth
your
while
to
put
out
your
strength
against
an
adversary
so
it
was
with
him
he
just
told
me
that
he
was
my
master
and
that
i
was
to
do
as
he
bade
me
and
what
did
you
say
i
promised
to
be
a
good
girl
said
caroline
and
not
to
pretend
to
have
any
opinion
of
my
own
ever
again
and
so
we
kissed
and
were
friends
i
dare
say
there
was
a
kiss
my
dear
of
course
there
was
and
he
held
me
in
his
arms
and
comforted
me
and
told
me
how
to
behave
just
as
you
would
do
a
little
girl
all
over
now
of
course
and
if
there
be
a
mistake
it
is
his
fault
i
feel
that
all
responsibility
is
gone
from
myself
and
that
for
all
the
rest
of
my
life
i
have
to
do
just
what
he
tells
me
and
what
says
the
divine
wallachia
poor
wally
she
says
nothing
but
she
thinks
that
i
am
a
castaway
and
a
recreant
i
am
a
recreant
i
know
but
yet
i
think
that
i
was
right
i
know
i
could
not
help
myself
of
course
you
were
right
my
dear
said
the
sage
nora
if
you
had
the
notion
in
your
head
it
was
wise
to
get
rid
of
it
but
i
knew
how
it
would
be
when
you
spoke
to
him
you
were
not
so
weak
when
he
came
to
you
that
was
altogether
another
thing
it
was
not
arranged
in
heaven
that
i
was
to
become
his
captive
after
that
wallachia
petrie
never
again
tried
her
influence
on
her
former
friend
but
admitted
to
herself
that
the
evil
was
done
and
that
it
could
not
be
remedied
according
to
her
theory
of
life
caroline
spalding
had
been
wrong
and
weak
had
shewn
herself
to
be
and
had
looked
to
get
her
happiness
from
soft
effeminate
pleasures
rather
than
from
rational
work
and
the
useful
independent
exercise
of
her
own
intelligence
in
the
privacy
of
her
little
chamber
wallachia
petrie
shed
not
absolute
tears
but
many
tearful
thoughts
over
her
friend
it
was
to
her
a
thing
very
terrible
that
the
chosen
one
of
her
heart
should
prefer
the
career
of
an
english
lord
wife
to
that
of
an
american
citizeness
with
all
manner
of
capability
for
female
voting
female
female
poetising
and
perhaps
female
political
action
before
her
it
was
a
thousand
pities
you
may
take
a
horse
to
water
said
wallachia
to
herself
thinking
of
the
springing
fountain
of
her
own
mind
at
which
caroline
spalding
would
always
have
been
made
welcome
freely
to
quench
her
thirst
but
you
can
not
make
him
drink
if
he
be
not
athirst
in
the
future
she
would
have
no
friend
never
again
would
she
subject
herself
to
the
disgrace
of
such
a
failure
but
the
sacrifice
was
to
be
made
and
she
knew
that
it
was
bootless
to
waste
her
words
further
on
caroline
spalding
she
left
florence
before
the
wedding
and
returned
alone
to
the
land
of
liberty
she
wrote
a
letter
to
caroline
explaining
her
conduct
and
caroline
spalding
shewed
the
letter
to
her
husband
as
one
that
was
both
loving
and
eloquent
very
loving
and
very
eloquent
he
said
but
nevertheless
one
does
think
of
sour
grapes
there
i
am
sure
you
wrong
her
said
caroline
chapter
lxxxii
french
carving
knife
during
these
days
there
were
terrible
doings
at
exeter
camilla
had
sworn
that
if
gibson
did
not
come
to
there
should
be
a
tragedy
and
it
appeared
that
she
was
inclined
to
keep
her
word
immediately
after
the
receipt
of
her
letter
from
gibson
she
had
had
an
interview
with
that
gentleman
in
his
lodgings
and
had
asked
him
his
intentions
he
had
taken
measures
to
fortify
himself
against
such
an
attack
but
whatever
those
measures
were
camilla
had
broken
through
them
she
had
stood
before
him
as
he
sat
in
his
and
he
had
been
dumb
in
her
presence
it
had
perhaps
been
well
for
him
that
the
eloquence
of
her
indignation
had
been
so
great
that
she
had
hardly
been
able
to
pause
a
moment
for
a
reply
will
you
take
your
letter
back
again
she
had
said
i
should
be
wrong
to
do
that
he
had
lisped
out
in
reply
because
it
is
true
as
a
christian
minister
i
could
not
stand
with
you
at
the
altar
with
a
lie
in
my
mouth
in
no
other
way
did
he
attempt
to
excuse
himself
but
that
twice
repeated
filled
up
all
the
pause
which
she
made
for
him
illustration
camilla
wrath
there
never
had
been
such
a
case
before
so
impudent
so
cruel
so
gross
so
uncalled
for
so
unmanly
so
unnecessary
so
unjustifiable
so
damnable
so
sure
of
eternal
condemnation
all
this
she
said
to
him
with
loud
voice
and
clenched
fist
and
starting
eyes
regardless
utterly
of
any
listeners
on
the
stairs
or
of
outside
passers
in
the
street
in
very
truth
she
was
moved
to
a
sublimity
of
indignation
her
low
nature
became
nearly
poetic
under
the
wrong
inflicted
upon
her
she
was
almost
tempted
to
tear
him
with
her
hands
and
inflict
upon
him
at
the
moment
some
terrible
vengeance
which
should
be
told
of
for
ever
in
the
annals
of
exeter
a
man
so
mean
as
he
so
weak
so
cowardly
one
so
little
of
a
hero
that
he
should
dare
to
do
it
and
dare
to
sit
there
before
her
and
to
say
that
he
would
do
it
your
gown
shall
be
torn
off
your
back
sir
and
the
very
boys
of
exeter
shall
drag
you
through
the
gutters
to
this
threat
he
said
nothing
but
sat
mute
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
and
now
tell
me
this
sir
is
there
anything
between
you
and
bella
but
there
was
no
voice
in
reply
answer
my
question
sir
i
have
a
right
to
ask
it
still
he
said
not
a
word
listen
to
me
sooner
than
that
you
and
she
should
be
man
and
wife
i
would
stab
her
yes
i
would
you
poor
paltry
lying
cowardly
creature
she
remained
with
him
for
more
than
half
an
hour
and
then
banged
out
of
the
room
flashing
back
a
look
of
scorn
at
him
as
she
went
martha
before
that
day
was
over
had
learned
the
whole
story
from
gibson
cook
and
had
told
her
mistress
i
did
not
think
he
had
so
much
spirit
in
him
was
miss
answer
throughout
exeter
the
great
wonder
arising
from
the
crisis
was
the
amount
of
spirit
which
had
been
displayed
by
gibson
when
he
was
left
alone
he
shook
himself
and
began
to
think
that
if
there
were
danger
that
such
interviews
might
occur
frequently
he
had
better
leave
exeter
for
good
as
he
put
his
hand
over
his
forehead
he
declared
to
himself
that
a
very
little
more
of
that
kind
of
thing
would
kill
him
when
a
couple
of
hours
had
passed
over
his
head
he
shook
himself
again
and
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
his
intended
i
do
not
mean
to
complain
he
said
god
knows
i
have
no
right
but
i
can
not
stand
a
repetition
of
what
has
occurred
just
now
if
your
younger
daughter
comes
to
see
me
again
i
must
refuse
to
see
her
and
shall
leave
the
town
i
am
ready
to
make
what
reparation
may
be
possible
for
the
mistake
into
which
i
have
fallen
french
was
no
doubt
much
afraid
of
her
younger
daughter
but
she
was
less
afraid
of
her
than
were
other
people
familiarity
they
say
breeds
contempt
and
who
can
be
so
familiar
with
a
child
as
its
parent
she
did
not
in
her
heart
believe
that
camilla
would
murder
anybody
and
she
fully
realised
the
conviction
that
even
after
all
that
was
come
and
gone
it
would
be
better
that
one
of
her
daughters
should
have
a
husband
than
that
neither
should
be
so
blessed
if
only
camilla
could
be
got
out
of
exeter
for
a
few
months
how
good
a
thing
it
would
be
for
them
all
she
had
a
brother
in
gloucester
if
only
he
could
be
got
to
take
camilla
for
a
few
months
and
then
too
she
knew
that
if
the
true
rights
of
her
two
daughters
were
strictly
and
impartially
examined
arabella
claim
was
much
stronger
than
any
that
camilla
could
put
forward
to
the
hand
of
gibson
you
must
not
go
there
again
camilla
the
mother
said
i
shall
go
whenever
i
please
replied
the
fury
now
camilla
we
may
as
well
understand
each
other
i
will
not
have
it
done
if
i
am
provoked
i
will
send
to
your
uncle
at
gloucester
now
the
uncle
at
gloucester
was
a
timber
merchant
a
man
with
protuberant
eyes
and
a
great
square
chin
known
to
be
a
very
stern
man
indeed
and
not
at
all
afraid
of
young
women
what
do
i
care
for
my
uncle
my
uncle
would
take
my
part
no
he
would
not
the
truth
is
camilla
you
interfered
with
bella
first
mamma
how
dare
you
say
so
you
did
my
dear
and
these
are
the
consequences
and
you
mean
to
say
that
she
is
to
be
mrs
gibson
i
say
nothing
about
that
but
i
do
not
see
why
they
should
be
married
if
their
hearts
are
inclined
to
each
other
i
will
die
first
your
dying
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
camilla
and
i
will
kill
her
if
you
speak
to
me
again
in
that
way
i
will
write
to
your
uncle
at
gloucester
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
for
you
both
and
i
will
not
bear
such
treatment
and
how
am
i
treated
you
should
not
have
interfered
with
your
sister
you
are
all
in
a
conspiracy
together
shouted
camilla
you
are
there
never
was
anybody
so
badly
treated
never
never
never
what
will
everybody
say
of
me
they
will
pity
you
if
you
will
be
quiet
i
do
want
to
be
pitied
i
wo
be
pitied
i
wish
i
could
die
and
i
will
die
anybody
else
would
at
any
rate
have
had
their
mother
and
sister
with
them
then
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
real
true
womanly
tears
after
this
there
was
a
lull
at
heavitree
for
a
few
days
camilla
did
not
speak
to
her
sister
but
she
condescended
to
hold
some
intercourse
with
her
mother
and
to
take
her
meals
at
the
family
table
she
did
not
go
out
of
the
house
but
she
employed
herself
in
her
own
room
doing
no
one
knew
what
with
all
that
new
clothing
and
household
gear
which
was
to
have
been
transferred
in
her
train
to
gibson
house
french
was
somewhat
uneasy
about
the
new
clothing
and
household
gear
feeling
that
in
the
event
of
marriage
at
least
a
considerable
portion
of
it
must
be
transferred
to
the
new
bride
but
it
was
impossible
at
the
present
moment
to
open
such
a
subject
to
camilla
it
would
have
been
as
a
proposition
to
a
lioness
respecting
the
taking
away
of
her
whelps
nevertheless
the
day
must
soon
come
in
which
something
must
be
said
about
the
clothing
and
household
gear
all
the
property
that
had
been
sent
into
the
house
at
camilla
orders
could
not
be
allowed
to
remain
as
perquisites
now
that
camilla
was
not
to
be
married
do
you
know
what
she
is
doing
my
dear
said
french
to
her
elder
daughter
perhaps
she
is
picking
out
the
marks
said
bella
i
do
think
she
would
do
that
as
yet
said
french
she
might
just
as
well
leave
it
alone
said
bella
feeling
that
one
of
the
two
letters
would
do
for
her
but
neither
of
them
dared
to
speak
to
her
of
her
occupation
in
these
first
days
of
her
despair
gibson
in
the
meantime
remained
at
home
or
only
left
his
house
to
go
to
the
cathedral
or
to
visit
the
narrow
confines
of
his
little
parish
when
he
was
out
he
felt
that
everybody
looked
at
him
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
people
whispered
about
him
when
they
saw
him
at
his
usual
desk
in
the
choir
his
friends
passed
him
merely
bowing
to
him
and
he
was
aware
that
he
had
done
that
which
would
be
regarded
by
every
one
around
him
as
unpardonable
and
yet
what
ought
he
to
have
done
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
had
been
very
foolish
mad
quite
demented
at
the
moment
when
he
allowed
himself
to
think
it
possible
that
he
should
marry
camilla
french
but
having
found
out
how
mad
he
had
been
at
that
moment
having
satisfied
himself
that
to
live
with
her
as
his
wife
would
be
impossible
was
he
not
right
to
break
the
engagement
could
anything
be
so
wicked
as
marrying
a
woman
whom
he
hated
thus
he
tried
to
excuse
himself
but
yet
he
knew
that
all
the
world
would
condemn
him
life
in
exeter
would
be
impossible
if
no
way
to
social
pardon
could
be
opened
for
him
he
was
willing
to
do
anything
within
bounds
in
mitigation
of
his
offence
he
would
give
up
fifty
pounds
a
year
to
camilla
for
his
life
or
he
would
marry
bella
yes
he
would
marry
bella
at
once
if
camilla
would
only
consent
and
give
up
that
idea
of
stabbing
some
one
bella
french
was
not
very
nice
in
his
eyes
but
she
was
quiet
he
thought
and
it
might
be
possible
to
live
with
her
nevertheless
he
told
himself
over
and
over
again
that
the
manner
in
which
unmarried
men
with
incomes
were
set
upon
by
ladies
in
want
of
husbands
was
very
disgraceful
to
the
country
at
large
that
mission
to
natal
which
had
once
been
offered
to
him
would
have
had
charms
for
him
now
of
which
he
had
not
recognised
the
force
when
he
rejected
it
do
you
think
that
he
ever
was
really
engaged
to
her
dorothy
said
to
her
aunt
dorothy
was
now
living
in
a
seventh
heaven
of
happiness
writing
to
brooke
burgess
every
other
day
and
devoting
to
this
occupation
a
number
of
hours
of
which
she
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
making
her
purchases
for
her
wedding
with
nothing
however
of
the
magnificence
of
a
camilla
but
discussing
everything
with
her
aunt
who
urged
her
on
to
extravagances
which
seemed
beyond
the
scope
of
her
own
economical
ideas
settling
or
trying
to
settle
little
difficulties
which
perplexed
her
somewhat
and
wondering
at
her
own
career
she
could
not
of
course
be
married
without
the
presence
of
her
mother
and
sister
and
her
aunt
with
something
of
a
grim
courtesy
had
intimated
that
they
should
be
made
welcome
to
the
house
in
the
close
for
the
special
occasion
but
nothing
had
been
said
about
hugh
the
wedding
was
to
be
in
the
cathedral
and
dorothy
had
a
little
scheme
in
her
head
for
meeting
her
brother
among
the
aisles
he
would
no
doubt
come
down
with
brooke
and
nothing
perhaps
need
be
said
about
it
to
aunt
stanbury
but
still
it
was
a
trouble
her
aunt
had
been
so
good
that
dorothy
felt
that
no
step
should
be
taken
which
would
vex
the
old
woman
it
was
evident
enough
that
when
permission
had
been
given
for
the
visit
of
stanbury
and
priscilla
hugh
name
had
been
purposely
kept
back
there
had
been
no
accidental
omission
dorothy
therefore
did
not
dare
to
mention
it
and
yet
it
was
essential
for
her
happiness
that
he
should
be
there
at
the
present
moment
miss
stanbury
intense
interest
in
the
stanbury
wedding
was
somewhat
mitigated
by
the
excitement
occasioned
by
gibson
refusal
to
be
married
dorothy
was
so
shocked
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
the
statement
that
had
reached
them
through
martha
of
course
he
was
engaged
to
her
we
all
knew
that
said
miss
stanbury
i
think
there
must
have
been
some
mistake
said
dorothy
i
see
how
he
could
do
it
there
is
no
knowing
what
people
can
do
my
dear
when
they
hard
driven
i
suppose
we
shall
have
a
lawsuit
now
and
he
have
to
pay
ever
so
much
money
well
well
well
see
what
a
deal
of
trouble
you
might
have
saved
but
he
have
done
the
same
to
me
aunt
only
you
know
i
never
could
have
taken
him
is
it
better
as
it
is
aunt
tell
me
i
suppose
young
women
always
think
it
best
when
they
can
get
their
own
ways
an
old
woman
like
me
has
only
got
to
do
what
she
is
bid
but
this
was
best
aunt
was
it
not
my
dear
you
had
your
way
and
let
that
be
enough
poor
camilla
french
is
not
allowed
to
have
hers
at
all
dear
dear
dear
i
think
the
man
would
ever
have
been
such
a
fool
to
begin
with
or
that
he
would
ever
have
had
the
heart
to
get
out
of
it
afterwards
it
astonished
dorothy
to
find
that
her
aunt
was
not
loud
in
reprobation
of
gibson
very
dreadful
conduct
in
the
meantime
french
had
written
to
her
brother
at
gloucester
the
in
making
miss
camilla
bed
and
in
putting
the
room
to
rights
as
she
called
it
which
description
probably
was
intended
to
cover
the
circumstances
of
an
accurate
search
had
discovered
hidden
among
some
linen
a
carving
knife
such
a
knife
as
is
used
for
the
cutting
up
of
fowls
and
after
two
interval
had
imparted
the
discovery
to
french
instant
visit
was
made
to
the
pantry
and
it
was
found
that
a
very
aged
but
unbroken
and
weapon
was
missing
french
at
once
accused
camilla
and
camilla
after
some
hesitation
admitted
that
it
might
be
there
molly
she
said
was
a
nasty
sly
wicked
thing
to
go
looking
in
her
drawers
and
she
would
never
leave
anything
unlocked
again
the
knife
she
declared
had
been
taken
because
she
had
wanted
something
very
sharp
to
cut
the
bones
of
her
stays
the
knife
was
given
up
but
french
thought
it
best
to
write
to
her
brother
crump
she
was
in
great
doubt
about
sundry
matters
had
the
carving
knife
really
pointed
to
a
domestic
tragedy
and
if
so
what
steps
ought
a
poor
widow
to
take
with
such
a
daughter
and
what
ought
to
be
done
about
gibson
it
ran
through
french
mind
that
unless
something
were
done
at
once
gibson
would
escape
scot
free
it
was
her
wish
that
he
should
yet
become
her
poor
bella
was
entitled
to
her
chance
but
if
bella
was
to
be
disappointed
from
fear
of
carving
knives
or
for
other
reasons
then
there
came
the
question
whether
gibson
should
not
be
made
to
pay
in
purse
for
the
mischief
he
had
done
with
all
these
thoughts
and
doubts
running
through
her
head
french
wrote
to
her
brother
at
gloucester
there
came
back
an
answer
from
crump
in
which
that
gentleman
expressed
a
very
strong
idea
that
gibson
should
be
prosecuted
for
damages
with
the
utmost
virulence
and
with
the
least
possible
delay
no
compromise
should
be
accepted
crump
would
himself
come
to
exeter
and
see
the
lawyer
as
soon
as
he
should
be
told
that
there
was
a
lawyer
to
be
seen
as
to
the
carving
knife
crump
was
of
opinion
that
it
did
not
mean
anything
crump
was
a
gentleman
who
did
not
believe
in
strong
romance
but
who
had
great
trust
in
all
pecuniary
claims
the
frenches
had
always
been
genteel
the
late
captain
french
had
been
an
officer
in
the
army
and
at
ordinary
times
and
seasons
the
frenches
were
rather
ashamed
of
the
crump
connection
but
now
the
timber
merchant
might
prove
himself
to
be
a
useful
friend
french
shewed
her
brother
letter
to
bella
and
poor
bella
was
again
seeing
that
nothing
was
said
in
it
of
her
claims
it
will
be
dreadful
scandal
to
have
it
all
in
the
papers
said
bella
but
what
can
we
do
anything
would
be
better
than
that
said
bella
and
you
do
want
to
punish
gibson
mamma
but
my
dear
you
see
what
your
uncle
says
what
can
i
do
except
go
to
him
for
advice
why
do
you
go
to
gibson
yourself
mamma
but
nothing
was
said
to
camilla
about
crump
nothing
as
yet
camilla
did
not
love
crump
but
there
was
no
other
house
except
that
of
crump
at
gloucester
to
which
she
might
be
sent
if
it
could
be
arranged
that
gibson
and
bella
should
be
made
one
french
took
her
eldest
daughter
advice
and
went
to
gibson
taking
crump
letter
in
her
pocket
for
herself
she
wanted
nothing
but
was
it
not
the
duty
of
her
whole
life
to
fight
for
her
daughters
poor
woman
if
somebody
would
only
have
taught
her
how
that
duty
might
best
be
done
she
would
have
endeavoured
to
obey
the
teaching
you
know
i
do
not
want
to
threaten
you
she
said
to
gibson
but
you
see
what
my
brother
says
of
course
i
wrote
to
my
brother
what
could
a
poor
woman
do
in
such
circumstances
except
write
to
her
brother
if
you
choose
to
set
the
bloodhounds
of
the
law
at
me
of
course
you
can
said
gibson
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
law
at
all
god
knows
i
do
not
said
french
then
there
was
a
pause
poor
dear
bella
ejaculated
french
dear
bella
echoed
gibson
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
bella
asked
french
i
sometimes
think
that
i
had
better
take
poison
and
have
done
with
it
said
gibson
feeling
himself
to
be
very
hard
pressed
chapter
lxxxiii
bella
victrix
crump
arrived
at
exeter
camilla
was
not
told
of
his
coming
till
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
he
arrived
and
then
the
tidings
were
communicated
because
it
was
necessary
that
a
change
should
be
made
in
the
she
and
her
sister
had
separate
rooms
when
there
was
no
visitor
with
them
but
now
crump
must
be
accommodated
there
was
a
long
consultation
between
bella
and
french
but
at
last
it
was
decided
that
bella
should
sleep
with
her
mother
there
would
still
be
too
much
of
the
lioness
about
camilla
to
allow
of
her
being
regarded
as
a
safe
companion
through
the
watches
of
the
night
why
is
uncle
jonas
coming
now
she
asked
i
thought
it
better
to
ask
him
said
french
after
a
long
pause
camilla
asked
another
question
does
uncle
jonas
mean
to
see
mr
gibson
i
suppose
he
will
said
french
then
he
will
see
a
low
mean
fellow
the
lowest
meanest
fellow
that
ever
was
heard
of
but
that
wo
make
much
difference
to
uncle
jonas
i
would
have
him
now
if
he
was
to
ask
me
ever
so
that
i
would
crump
came
and
kissed
his
sister
and
two
nieces
the
embrace
with
camilla
was
not
very
affectionate
so
your
joe
has
been
and
jilted
you
said
uncle
jonas
it
like
one
of
them
clergymen
they
say
so
many
prayers
they
think
they
may
do
almost
anything
afterwards
another
man
would
have
had
his
head
punched
the
less
talk
there
is
about
it
the
better
said
camilla
on
the
following
day
crump
called
by
appointment
on
gibson
and
remained
closeted
with
that
gentleman
for
the
greater
portion
of
the
morning
camilla
knew
well
that
he
was
going
and
went
about
the
house
like
a
perturbed
spirit
during
his
absence
there
was
a
look
about
her
that
made
them
all
doubt
whether
she
was
not
in
truth
losing
her
mind
her
mother
more
than
once
went
to
the
pantry
to
see
that
the
knives
were
right
and
as
regarded
that
weapon
was
careful
to
lock
it
up
carefully
out
of
her
way
crump
had
declared
himself
willing
to
take
camilla
back
to
gloucester
and
had
laughed
at
the
obstacles
which
his
niece
might
perhaps
throw
in
the
way
of
such
an
arrangement
she
must
have
much
luggage
that
is
all
said
crump
for
crump
had
been
made
aware
of
the
circumstances
of
the
trousseau
about
three
crump
came
back
from
gibson
and
expressed
a
desire
to
be
left
alone
with
camilla
french
was
prepared
for
everything
and
crump
soon
found
himself
with
his
younger
niece
camilla
my
dear
said
he
this
has
been
a
bad
business
i
do
know
what
business
you
mean
uncle
jonas
yes
you
do
my
dear
you
know
and
i
hope
it
wo
come
too
late
to
prove
to
you
that
young
women
should
be
too
keen
in
setting
their
caps
at
the
gentlemen
it
better
for
them
to
be
hunted
than
to
hunt
uncle
jonas
i
will
not
be
insulted
stick
to
that
my
dear
and
you
wo
get
into
a
scrape
again
now
look
here
this
man
can
never
be
made
to
marry
you
anyhow
i
would
touch
him
with
a
pair
of
tongs
if
he
were
kneeling
at
my
feet
that
right
stick
to
that
of
course
you
would
now
after
all
that
has
come
and
gone
no
girl
with
any
spirit
would
he
a
coward
and
a
thief
and
he
be
damned
for
what
he
has
done
some
of
these
days
that
is
a
proper
way
for
a
young
lady
to
talk
that
cursing
and
swearing
it
is
cursing
and
swearing
it
what
the
bible
says
then
we
leave
him
to
the
bible
in
the
meantime
gibson
wants
to
marry
some
one
else
and
that
ca
hurt
you
he
may
marry
whom
he
likes
but
he
sha
marry
bella
that
all
it
is
bella
that
he
means
to
marry
then
he
wo
i
forbid
the
banns
i
write
to
the
bishop
go
to
the
church
and
prevent
its
being
done
i
make
such
a
noise
in
the
town
that
it
ca
be
done
it
no
use
your
looking
at
me
like
that
uncle
jonas
i
got
my
own
feelings
and
he
shall
never
marry
bella
it
what
they
have
been
intending
all
through
and
it
sha
be
done
it
will
be
done
uncle
jonas
i
stab
her
to
the
heart
and
him
too
before
see
it
done
though
i
were
to
be
killed
the
next
day
i
would
could
you
bear
it
i
not
a
young
woman
now
i
tell
you
what
i
want
you
to
do
i
not
do
anything
just
pack
up
your
things
and
start
with
me
to
gloucester
i
wo
then
you
be
carried
my
dear
i
write
to
your
aunt
to
say
that
you
coming
and
we
be
as
jolly
as
possible
when
we
get
you
home
i
wo
go
to
gloucester
uncle
jonas
i
wo
go
away
from
exeter
i
wo
let
it
be
done
she
shall
never
never
never
be
that
wife
nevertheless
on
the
day
but
one
after
this
camilla
french
did
go
to
gloucester
before
she
went
however
things
had
to
be
done
in
that
house
which
almost
made
french
repent
that
she
had
sent
for
so
stern
an
assistant
camilla
was
at
last
told
in
so
many
words
that
the
things
which
she
had
prepared
for
her
own
wedding
must
be
given
up
for
the
wedding
of
her
sister
and
it
seemed
that
this
item
in
the
list
of
her
sorrows
troubled
her
almost
more
than
any
other
she
swore
that
whither
she
went
there
should
go
the
dresses
and
the
handkerchiefs
and
the
hats
the
bonnets
and
the
boots
let
her
have
them
bella
had
pleaded
but
crump
was
inexorable
he
had
looked
into
his
sister
affairs
and
found
that
she
was
already
in
debt
to
his
practical
mind
it
was
an
absurdity
that
the
unmarried
sister
should
keep
things
that
were
wholly
unnecessary
and
that
the
sister
that
was
to
be
married
should
be
without
things
that
were
needed
there
was
a
big
trunk
of
which
camilla
had
the
key
but
which
unfortunately
for
her
had
been
deposited
in
her
room
upon
this
she
sat
and
swore
that
nothing
should
move
her
but
a
promise
that
her
plunder
should
remain
untouched
but
there
came
this
advantage
from
the
terrible
question
of
the
wedding
raiments
that
in
her
energy
to
keep
possession
of
them
she
gradually
abandoned
her
opposition
to
her
sister
marriage
she
had
been
driven
from
one
point
to
another
till
she
was
compelled
at
last
to
stand
solely
upon
her
possessions
perhaps
we
had
better
let
her
keep
them
said
french
trash
and
nonsense
said
crump
if
she
wants
a
new
frock
let
her
have
it
as
for
the
sheets
and
tablecloths
better
keep
them
yourself
but
bella
must
have
the
rest
it
was
found
on
the
eve
of
the
day
on
which
she
was
told
that
she
was
to
depart
that
she
had
in
truth
armed
herself
with
a
dagger
or
clasp
knife
she
actually
displayed
it
when
her
uncle
told
her
to
come
away
from
the
chest
on
which
she
was
sitting
she
declared
that
she
would
defend
herself
there
to
the
last
gasp
of
her
life
but
of
course
the
knife
fell
from
her
hand
the
first
moment
that
she
was
touched
i
did
think
once
that
she
was
going
to
make
a
poke
at
me
crump
said
afterwards
but
she
had
screamed
herself
so
weak
that
she
could
do
it
when
the
morning
came
she
was
taken
to
the
fly
and
driven
to
the
station
without
any
further
serious
outbreak
she
had
even
condescended
to
select
certain
articles
leaving
the
rest
of
the
hymeneal
wealth
behind
her
bella
early
on
that
morning
of
departure
with
great
humility
implored
her
sister
to
forgive
her
but
no
entreaties
could
induce
camilla
to
address
one
gracious
word
to
the
proposed
bride
you
been
cheating
me
all
along
she
said
and
that
was
the
last
word
she
spoke
to
poor
bella
she
went
and
the
field
was
once
more
open
to
the
amorous
vicar
of
it
is
astonishing
how
the
greatest
difficulties
will
sink
away
and
become
as
it
were
nothing
when
they
are
encountered
face
to
face
it
is
certain
that
position
had
been
one
most
trying
to
the
nerves
he
had
speculated
on
various
modes
of
escape
a
curacy
in
the
north
of
england
would
be
welcome
or
the
duties
of
a
missionary
in
new
zealand
or
death
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
during
the
last
week
or
two
contemplated
even
a
return
to
the
dominion
of
camilla
that
there
should
ever
again
be
things
pleasant
for
him
in
exeter
seemed
to
be
quite
impossible
and
yet
on
the
evening
of
the
day
but
one
after
the
departure
of
camilla
he
was
seated
almost
comfortably
with
his
own
arabella
there
is
nothing
that
a
man
may
not
do
nothing
that
he
may
not
achieve
if
he
have
only
pluck
enough
to
go
through
with
it
you
do
love
me
bella
said
to
him
it
was
natural
that
she
should
ask
him
but
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
if
she
had
held
her
tongue
had
she
spoken
to
him
about
his
house
or
his
income
or
the
servants
or
the
duties
of
his
parish
church
it
would
have
been
easier
for
him
to
make
a
comfortable
reply
yes
i
love
you
he
replied
of
course
i
love
you
we
have
always
been
friends
and
i
hope
things
will
go
straight
now
i
have
had
a
great
deal
to
go
through
bella
and
so
have
you
but
god
will
temper
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lambs
how
was
the
wind
to
be
tempered
for
the
poor
lamb
who
had
gone
forth
shorn
down
to
the
very
skin
soon
after
this
french
returned
to
the
room
and
then
there
was
no
more
romance
french
had
by
no
means
forgiven
gibson
all
the
trouble
he
had
brought
into
the
family
and
mixed
a
certain
amount
of
acrimony
with
her
entertainment
of
him
she
dictated
to
him
treated
him
with
but
scant
respect
and
did
not
hesitate
to
let
him
understand
that
he
was
to
be
watched
very
closely
till
he
was
actually
and
absolutely
married
the
poor
man
had
in
truth
no
further
idea
of
escape
he
was
aware
that
he
had
done
that
which
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
bear
a
great
deal
and
that
he
had
no
right
to
resent
suspicion
when
a
day
was
fixed
in
june
on
which
he
should
be
married
at
the
church
of
heavitree
and
it
was
proposed
that
he
should
be
married
by
banns
he
had
nothing
to
urge
to
the
contrary
and
when
it
was
also
suggested
to
him
by
one
of
the
prebendaries
of
the
cathedral
that
it
might
be
well
for
him
to
change
his
clerical
duties
for
a
period
with
the
vicar
of
a
remote
parish
in
the
north
of
cornwall
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
remark
from
those
whom
he
had
scandalised
by
his
conduct
he
had
no
objection
to
make
to
that
arrangement
when
machugh
met
him
in
the
close
and
told
him
that
he
was
a
gay
lothario
he
shook
his
head
with
a
melancholy
and
passed
on
without
even
a
feeling
of
anger
when
they
smite
me
on
the
right
cheek
i
turn
unto
them
my
left
he
said
to
himself
when
one
of
the
cathedral
vergers
remarked
to
him
that
after
all
he
was
going
to
be
married
at
last
even
bella
became
dominant
over
him
and
assumed
with
him
occasionally
the
air
of
one
who
had
been
injured
bella
wrote
a
touching
letter
to
her
sister
a
letter
that
ought
to
have
touched
camilla
begging
for
forgiveness
and
for
one
word
of
sisterly
love
camilla
answered
the
letter
but
did
not
send
a
word
of
sisterly
love
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
you
have
been
a
nasty
sly
thing
and
i
do
believe
you
ever
be
happy
as
for
him
i
never
speak
to
him
again
that
was
nearly
the
whole
of
her
letter
you
must
leave
it
to
time
said
french
wisely
come
round
some
day
and
then
french
thought
how
bad
it
would
be
for
her
if
the
daughter
who
was
to
be
her
future
companion
did
not
come
round
some
day
and
so
it
was
settled
that
they
should
be
married
in
heavitree
church
gibson
and
his
first
love
and
things
went
on
pretty
much
as
though
nothing
had
been
done
amiss
the
gentleman
from
cornwall
came
down
to
take
gibson
place
at
while
his
duties
in
the
cathedral
were
temporarily
divided
among
the
other
with
some
amount
of
grumbling
on
their
part
bella
commenced
her
modest
preparations
without
any
of
the
éclat
which
had
attended
camilla
operations
but
she
felt
more
certainty
of
ultimate
success
than
had
ever
fallen
to
camilla
lot
in
spite
of
all
that
had
come
and
gone
bella
never
feared
again
that
gibson
would
be
untrue
to
her
in
regard
to
him
it
must
be
doubted
whether
nemesis
ever
fell
upon
him
with
a
hand
sufficiently
heavy
to
punish
him
for
the
great
sins
which
he
had
manifestly
committed
he
had
encountered
a
bad
week
or
two
and
there
had
been
days
in
which
as
has
been
said
he
thought
of
natal
of
ecclesiastical
censures
and
even
of
annihilation
but
no
real
punishment
seemed
to
fall
upon
him
it
may
be
doubted
whether
when
the
whole
arrangement
was
settled
for
him
and
when
he
heard
that
camilla
had
yielded
to
the
decrees
of
fate
he
did
not
rather
flatter
himself
on
being
a
successful
man
of
intrigue
whether
he
did
not
take
some
glory
to
himself
for
his
good
fortune
with
women
and
pride
himself
amidst
his
for
the
devotion
which
had
been
displayed
for
him
by
the
fair
sex
in
general
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
taught
himself
to
believe
that
at
one
time
dorothy
stanbury
was
devotedly
in
love
with
him
and
that
when
he
reckoned
up
his
sins
she
was
one
of
those
in
regard
to
whom
he
accounted
himself
to
have
been
a
sinner
the
spirit
of
intrigue
with
women
as
to
which
men
will
flatter
themselves
is
customarily
so
vile
so
mean
so
vapid
a
reflection
of
a
feeling
so
aimless
resultless
and
utterly
unworthy
passion
exists
and
has
its
sway
vice
has
its
votaries
and
there
is
too
that
longing
for
vice
prurient
yet
passionless
lewdness
which
drags
on
a
feeble
continuance
with
the
aid
of
money
but
the
commonest
folly
of
man
in
regard
to
women
is
a
weak
taste
for
intrigue
with
little
or
nothing
on
which
to
feed
it
a
worse
than
feminine
aptitude
for
male
coquetry
which
never
ascends
beyond
a
desire
that
somebody
shall
hint
that
there
is
something
peculiar
and
which
is
shocked
and
retreats
backwards
into
its
boots
when
anything
like
a
consequence
forces
itself
on
the
apprehension
such
men
have
their
glory
in
their
own
estimation
we
remember
how
falstaff
flouted
the
pride
of
his
companion
whose
victory
in
the
fields
of
love
had
been
but
little
glorious
but
there
are
victories
going
so
infinitely
less
glorious
that
falstaff
page
was
a
lothario
a
very
don
juan
in
comparison
with
the
heroes
whose
praises
are
too
often
sung
by
their
own
lips
there
is
this
recompense
that
their
defeats
are
always
sung
by
lips
louder
than
their
own
gibson
when
he
found
that
he
was
to
escape
apparently
unscathed
that
people
standing
respectably
before
the
world
absolutely
dared
to
whisper
words
to
him
of
congratulation
on
this
third
attempt
at
marriage
within
little
more
than
a
year
took
pride
to
himself
and
bethought
himself
that
he
was
a
gay
deceiver
he
believed
that
he
had
selected
his
wife
and
that
he
had
done
so
in
circumstances
of
peculiar
difficulty
poor
gibson
we
hardly
know
whether
most
to
pity
him
or
the
unfortunate
poor
woman
who
ultimately
became
gibson
and
so
bella
french
is
to
be
the
fortunate
woman
after
all
said
miss
stanbury
to
her
niece
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
so
odd
said
dorothy
i
wonder
how
he
looked
when
he
proposed
it
like
a
fool
as
he
always
does
dorothy
refrained
from
remarking
that
miss
stanbury
had
not
always
thought
that
gibson
looked
like
a
fool
but
the
idea
occurred
to
her
mind
i
hope
they
will
be
happy
at
last
she
said
pshaw
such
people
ca
be
happy
and
ca
be
unhappy
i
suppose
it
much
matters
which
he
marries
or
whether
he
marries
them
both
or
neither
they
are
to
be
married
by
banns
they
say
at
heavitree
i
do
see
anything
bad
in
that
only
camilla
might
step
out
and
forbid
them
said
aunt
stanbury
i
almost
wish
she
would
she
has
gone
away
aunt
to
an
uncle
who
lives
at
gloucester
it
was
well
to
get
her
out
of
the
way
no
doubt
they
be
married
before
you
now
dolly
that
wo
break
my
heart
aunt
i
do
suppose
there
be
much
of
a
wedding
they
have
anybody
belonging
to
them
except
that
uncle
at
gloucester
then
there
was
a
pause
i
think
it
is
a
nice
thing
for
friends
to
collect
together
at
a
wedding
continued
aunt
stanbury
i
think
it
is
said
dorothy
in
the
mildest
softest
voice
i
suppose
we
must
make
room
for
that
black
sheep
of
a
brother
of
yours
dolly
or
else
you
wo
be
contented
dear
dear
dearest

chapter
lxxxiv
illustration
trevelyan
when
his
wife
had
left
him
sat
for
hours
in
silence
pondering
over
his
own
position
and
hers
he
had
taken
his
child
to
an
upper
room
in
which
was
his
own
bed
and
the
boy
cot
and
before
he
seated
himself
he
spread
out
various
toys
which
he
had
been
at
pains
to
purchase
for
the
unhappy
little
fellow
a
regiment
of
garibaldian
soldiers
all
with
red
shirts
and
a
drum
to
give
the
regiment
martial
spirit
and
a
soft
fluffy
italian
ball
and
a
battledore
and
a
shuttlecock
instruments
enough
for
juvenile
joy
if
only
there
had
been
a
companion
with
whom
the
child
could
use
them
but
the
toys
remained
where
the
father
had
placed
them
almost
unheeded
and
the
child
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
melancholy
silent
and
repressed
even
the
drum
did
not
tempt
him
to
be
noisy
doubtless
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
wretched
but
he
was
fully
conscious
of
his
wretchedness
in
the
meantime
the
father
sat
motionless
in
an
old
but
once
handsome
leathern
with
his
eyes
fixed
against
the
opposite
wall
thinking
of
the
wreck
of
his
life
thought
deep
correct
continued
and
energetic
is
quite
compatible
with
madness
at
this
time
trevelyan
mind
was
so
far
unhinged
his
ordinary
faculties
were
so
greatly
impaired
that
they
who
declared
him
to
be
mad
were
justified
in
their
declaration
his
condition
was
such
that
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
no
human
being
not
even
his
own
could
safely
be
entrusted
to
his
keeping
he
considered
himself
to
have
been
so
injured
by
the
world
to
have
been
the
victim
of
so
cruel
a
conspiracy
among
those
who
ought
to
have
been
his
friends
that
there
remained
nothing
for
him
but
to
flee
away
from
them
and
remain
in
solitude
but
yet
through
it
all
there
was
something
approaching
to
a
conviction
that
he
had
brought
his
misery
upon
himself
by
being
unlike
to
other
men
and
he
declared
to
himself
over
and
over
again
that
it
was
better
that
he
should
suffer
than
that
others
should
be
punished
when
he
was
alone
his
reflections
respecting
his
wife
were
much
juster
than
were
his
words
when
he
spoke
either
with
her
or
to
others
of
her
conduct
he
would
declare
to
himself
not
only
that
he
did
not
believe
her
to
have
been
false
to
him
but
that
he
had
never
accused
her
of
such
crime
he
had
demanded
from
her
obedience
and
she
had
been
disobedient
it
had
been
incumbent
upon
him
so
ran
his
own
ideas
as
expressed
to
himself
in
these
long
unspoken
soliloquies
to
exact
obedience
or
at
least
compliance
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
she
had
refused
to
obey
or
even
to
comply
and
the
consequences
were
very
grievous
but
though
he
pitied
himself
with
a
pity
that
was
feminine
yet
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
her
conduct
had
been
the
result
of
his
own
moody
temperament
every
friend
had
parted
from
him
all
those
to
whose
counsels
he
had
listened
had
counselled
him
that
he
was
wrong
the
whole
world
was
against
him
had
he
remained
in
england
the
doctors
and
lawyers
among
them
would
doubtless
have
declared
him
to
be
mad
he
knew
all
this
and
yet
he
could
not
yield
he
could
not
say
that
he
had
been
wrong
he
could
not
even
think
that
he
had
been
wrong
as
to
the
cause
of
the
great
quarrel
he
was
one
so
miserable
and
so
unfortunate
so
he
thought
that
even
in
doing
right
he
had
fallen
into
perdition
he
had
had
two
enemies
and
between
them
they
had
worked
his
ruin
these
were
colonel
osborne
and
bozzle
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
did
not
hate
the
latter
the
more
strongly
of
the
two
he
knew
now
that
bozzle
had
been
untrue
to
him
but
his
disgust
did
not
spring
from
that
so
much
as
from
the
feeling
that
he
had
defiled
himself
by
dealing
with
the
man
though
he
was
quite
assured
that
he
had
been
right
in
his
first
cause
of
offence
he
knew
that
he
had
fallen
from
bad
to
worse
in
every
step
that
he
had
taken
since
colonel
osborne
had
marred
his
happiness
by
vanity
by
wicked
intrigue
by
a
devilish
delight
in
doing
mischief
but
he
he
himself
had
consummated
the
evil
by
his
own
folly
why
had
he
not
taken
colonel
osborne
by
the
throat
instead
of
going
to
a
vile
mercenary
spy
for
assistance
he
hated
himself
for
what
he
had
done
and
yet
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
yield
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
yield
but
it
was
yet
open
to
him
to
sacrifice
himself
he
could
not
go
back
to
his
wife
and
say
that
he
was
wrong
but
he
could
determine
that
the
destruction
should
fall
upon
him
and
not
upon
her
if
he
gave
up
his
child
and
then
died
died
alone
without
any
friend
near
him
with
no
word
of
love
in
his
ears
in
that
solitary
and
miserable
abode
which
he
had
found
for
himself
then
it
would
at
least
be
acknowledged
that
he
had
expiated
the
injury
that
he
had
done
she
would
have
his
wealth
his
name
his
child
to
comfort
her
and
would
be
troubled
no
longer
by
demands
for
that
obedience
which
she
had
sworn
at
the
altar
to
give
him
and
which
she
had
since
declined
to
render
to
him
perhaps
there
was
some
feeling
that
the
coals
of
fire
would
be
hot
upon
her
head
when
she
should
think
how
much
she
had
received
from
him
and
how
little
she
had
done
for
him
and
yet
he
loved
her
with
all
his
heart
and
would
even
yet
dream
of
bliss
that
might
be
possible
with
her
had
not
the
terrible
hand
of
irresistible
fate
come
between
them
and
marred
it
all
it
was
only
a
dream
now
it
could
be
no
more
than
a
dream
he
put
out
his
thin
wasted
hands
and
looked
at
them
and
touched
the
hollowness
of
his
own
cheeks
and
coughed
that
he
might
hear
the
hacking
sound
of
his
own
infirmity
and
almost
took
glory
in
his
weakness
it
could
not
be
long
before
the
coals
of
fire
would
be
heaped
upon
her
head
louey
he
said
at
last
addressing
the
child
who
had
sat
for
an
hour
gazing
through
the
window
without
stirring
a
limb
or
uttering
a
sound
louey
my
boy
would
you
like
to
go
back
to
mamma
the
child
turned
round
on
the
floor
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
father
face
but
made
no
immediate
reply
louey
dear
come
to
papa
and
tell
him
would
it
be
nice
to
go
back
to
mamma
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
the
boy
louey
got
up
and
approached
slowly
and
stood
between
his
father
knees
tell
me
darling
you
understand
what
papa
says
altro
said
the
boy
who
had
been
long
enough
among
italian
servants
to
pick
up
the
common
words
of
the
language
of
course
he
would
like
to
go
back
how
indeed
could
it
be
otherwise
then
you
shall
go
to
her
louey
papa
not
nor
but
the
day
after
that
is
sufficient
you
shall
go
it
is
not
so
bad
with
you
that
one
day
more
need
be
a
sorrow
to
you
you
shall
go
and
then
you
will
never
see
your
father
again
trevelyan
as
he
said
this
drew
his
hands
away
so
as
not
to
touch
the
child
the
little
fellow
had
put
out
his
arm
but
seeing
his
father
angry
gesture
had
made
no
further
attempt
at
a
caress
he
feared
his
father
from
the
bottom
of
his
little
heart
and
yet
was
aware
that
it
was
his
duty
to
try
to
love
papa
he
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
that
last
threat
but
slunk
back
passing
his
untouched
toys
to
the
window
and
there
seated
himself
again
filling
his
mind
with
the
thought
that
when
two
more
long
long
days
should
have
crept
by
he
should
once
more
go
to
his
mother
trevelyan
had
tried
his
best
to
be
soft
and
gentle
to
his
child
all
that
he
had
said
to
his
wife
of
his
treatment
of
the
boy
had
been
true
to
the
letter
he
had
spared
no
personal
trouble
he
had
done
all
that
he
had
known
how
to
do
he
had
exercised
all
his
intelligence
to
procure
amusement
for
the
boy
but
louey
had
hardly
smiled
since
he
had
been
taken
from
his
mother
and
now
that
he
was
told
that
he
was
to
go
and
never
see
his
father
again
the
tidings
were
to
him
simply
tidings
of
joy
there
is
a
curse
upon
me
said
trevelyan
it
is
written
down
in
the
book
of
my
destiny
that
nothing
shall
ever
love
me
he
went
out
from
the
house
and
made
his
way
down
by
the
narrow
path
through
the
olives
and
vines
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
in
front
of
the
villa
it
was
evening
now
but
the
evening
was
very
hot
and
though
the
olive
trees
stood
in
long
rows
there
was
no
shade
quite
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
there
was
a
little
sluggish
muddy
brook
along
the
sides
of
which
the
reeds
grew
thickly
and
the
were
playing
on
the
water
there
was
nothing
attractive
in
the
spot
but
he
was
weary
and
sat
himself
down
on
the
dry
hard
bank
which
had
been
made
by
repeated
clearing
of
mud
from
the
bottom
of
the
little
rivulet
he
sat
watching
the
as
they
made
their
short
flights
in
the
warm
air
and
told
himself
that
of
all
god
creatures
there
was
not
one
to
whom
less
power
of
disporting
itself
in
sun
was
given
than
to
him
surely
it
would
be
better
for
him
that
he
should
die
than
live
as
he
was
now
living
without
any
of
the
joys
of
life
the
solitude
of
casalunga
was
intolerable
to
him
and
yet
there
was
no
whither
that
he
could
go
and
find
society
he
could
travel
if
he
pleased
he
had
money
at
command
and
at
any
rate
as
yet
there
was
no
embargo
on
his
personal
liberty
but
how
could
he
travel
alone
even
if
his
strength
might
suffice
for
the
work
there
had
been
moments
in
which
he
had
thought
that
he
would
be
happy
in
the
love
of
his
child
that
the
companionship
of
an
infant
would
suffice
for
him
if
only
the
infant
would
love
him
but
all
such
dreams
as
that
were
over
to
repay
him
for
his
tenderness
his
boy
was
always
dumb
before
him
louey
would
not
prattle
as
he
had
used
to
do
he
would
not
even
smile
or
give
back
the
kisses
with
which
his
father
had
attempted
to
win
him
in
mercy
to
the
boy
he
would
send
him
back
to
his
mother
in
mercy
to
the
boy
if
not
to
the
mother
also
it
was
in
vain
that
he
should
look
for
any
joy
in
any
quarter
were
he
to
return
to
england
they
would
say
that
he
was
mad
illustration
trevelyan
at
casalunga
he
lay
there
by
the
till
the
evening
was
far
advanced
and
then
he
arose
and
slowly
returned
to
the
house
the
labour
of
ascending
the
hill
was
so
great
to
him
that
he
was
forced
to
pause
and
hold
by
the
olive
trees
as
he
slowly
performed
his
task
the
perspiration
came
in
profusion
from
his
pores
and
he
found
himself
to
be
so
weak
that
he
must
in
future
regard
the
brook
as
being
beyond
the
tether
of
his
daily
exercise
eighteen
months
ago
he
had
been
a
strong
walker
and
the
paths
of
swiss
mountains
had
been
a
joy
to
him
he
paused
as
he
was
slowly
dragging
himself
on
and
looked
up
at
the
wretched
desolate
comfortless
abode
which
he
called
his
home
its
dreariness
was
so
odious
to
him
that
he
was
to
lay
himself
down
where
he
was
and
let
the
night
air
come
upon
him
and
do
its
worst
in
such
case
however
some
italian
doctor
would
be
sent
down
who
would
say
that
he
was
mad
above
all
the
things
and
to
the
last
he
must
save
himself
from
that
degradation
when
he
had
crawled
up
to
the
house
he
went
to
his
child
and
found
that
the
woman
had
put
the
boy
to
bed
then
he
was
angry
with
himself
in
that
he
himself
had
not
seen
to
this
and
kept
up
his
practice
of
attending
the
child
to
the
last
he
would
at
least
be
true
to
his
resolution
and
prepare
for
the
boy
return
to
his
mother
not
knowing
how
otherwise
to
manage
it
he
wrote
that
night
the
following
note
to
glascock
casalunga
thursday
night
my
dear
sir
since
you
last
were
considerate
enough
to
call
upon
me
i
have
resolved
to
take
a
step
in
my
affairs
which
though
it
will
rob
me
of
my
only
remaining
gratification
will
tend
to
lessen
the
troubles
under
which
trevelyan
is
labouring
if
she
desires
it
as
no
doubt
she
does
i
will
consent
to
place
our
boy
again
in
her
custody
trusting
to
her
sense
of
honour
to
restore
him
to
me
should
i
demand
it
in
my
present
unfortunate
position
i
can
not
suggest
that
she
should
come
for
the
boy
i
am
unable
to
support
the
excitement
occasioned
by
her
presence
i
will
however
deliver
up
my
darling
either
to
you
or
to
any
messenger
sent
by
you
whom
i
can
trust
i
beg
heartily
to
apologise
for
the
trouble
i
am
giving
you
and
to
subscribe
myself
yours
very
faithfully
louis
trevelyan
the
hon
glascock
it
is
as
well
perhaps
that
i
should
explain
that
i
must
decline
to
receive
any
visit
from
sir
marmaduke
rowley
sir
marmaduke
has
insulted
me
grossly
on
each
occasion
on
which
i
have
seen
him
since
his
return
home
chapter
lxxxv
the
baths
of
lucca
june
was
now
far
advanced
and
the
rowleys
and
the
spaldings
had
removed
from
florence
to
the
baths
of
lucca
glascock
had
followed
in
their
wake
and
the
whole
party
were
living
at
the
baths
in
one
of
those
hotels
in
which
so
many
english
and
americans
are
wont
to
congregate
in
the
early
weeks
of
the
italian
summer
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
in
the
last
week
of
the
month
and
all
the
party
were
to
return
to
florence
for
the
occasion
with
the
exception
of
sir
marmaduke
and
trevelyan
she
was
altogether
unfitted
for
wedding
joys
and
her
father
had
promised
to
bear
her
company
when
the
others
left
her
glascock
and
caroline
spalding
were
to
be
married
in
florence
and
were
to
depart
immediately
from
thence
for
some
of
the
cooler
parts
of
switzerland
after
that
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
were
to
return
to
london
with
their
daughters
preparatory
to
that
dreary
journey
back
to
the
mandarins
and
they
had
not
even
yet
resolved
what
they
had
better
do
respecting
that
unfortunate
man
who
was
living
in
seclusion
on
the
near
siena
they
had
consulted
lawyers
and
doctors
in
florence
but
it
had
seemed
that
everybody
there
was
afraid
of
putting
the
law
in
force
against
an
englishman
doubtless
there
was
a
law
in
respect
to
the
custody
of
the
insane
and
it
was
admitted
that
if
trevelyan
were
dangerously
mad
something
could
be
done
but
it
seemed
that
nobody
was
willing
to
stir
in
such
a
case
as
that
which
now
existed
something
it
was
said
might
be
done
at
some
future
time
but
the
difficulties
were
so
great
that
nothing
could
be
done
now
it
was
very
sad
because
it
was
necessary
that
some
decision
should
be
made
as
to
the
future
residence
of
trevelyan
and
of
nora
emily
had
declared
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
go
to
the
islands
with
her
father
and
mother
unless
her
boy
went
with
her
since
her
journey
to
casalunga
she
had
also
expressed
her
unwillingness
to
leave
her
husband
her
heart
had
been
greatly
softened
towards
him
and
she
had
declared
that
where
he
remained
there
would
she
remain
as
near
to
him
as
circumstances
would
admit
it
might
be
that
at
last
her
care
would
be
necessary
for
his
comfort
he
supplied
her
with
means
of
living
and
she
would
use
these
means
as
well
as
she
might
be
able
in
his
service
then
there
had
arisen
the
question
of
nora
future
residence
and
there
had
come
troubles
and
storms
in
the
family
nora
had
said
that
she
would
not
go
back
to
the
mandarins
but
had
not
at
first
been
able
to
say
where
or
how
she
would
live
she
had
suggested
that
she
might
stay
with
her
sister
but
her
father
had
insisted
that
she
could
not
live
on
the
income
supplied
by
trevelyan
then
when
pressed
hard
she
had
declared
that
she
intended
to
live
on
hugh
stanbury
income
she
would
marry
him
at
once
with
her
leave
if
she
could
get
it
but
without
it
if
it
needs
must
be
so
her
mother
told
her
that
hugh
stanbury
was
not
himself
ready
for
her
he
had
not
even
proposed
so
hasty
a
marriage
nor
had
he
any
home
fitted
for
her
lady
rowley
in
arguing
this
had
expressed
no
assent
to
the
marriage
even
as
a
distant
arrangement
but
had
thought
thus
to
vanquish
her
daughter
by
suggesting
small
but
insuperable
difficulties
on
a
sudden
however
lady
rowley
found
that
all
this
was
turned
against
her
by
an
offer
that
came
direct
from
glascock
his
caroline
he
said
was
very
anxious
that
nora
should
come
to
them
at
monkhams
as
soon
as
they
had
returned
home
from
switzerland
they
intended
to
be
there
by
the
middle
of
august
and
would
hurry
there
sooner
if
there
was
any
intermediate
difficulty
about
finding
a
home
for
nora
glascock
said
nothing
about
hugh
stanbury
but
of
course
lady
rowley
understood
that
nora
had
told
all
her
troubles
and
hopes
to
caroline
and
that
caroline
had
told
them
to
her
future
husband
lady
rowley
in
answer
to
this
could
only
say
that
she
would
consult
her
husband
there
was
something
very
grievous
in
the
proposition
to
lady
rowley
if
nora
had
not
been
and
beyond
the
usual
and
of
young
women
she
might
have
been
herself
the
mistress
of
monkhams
it
was
proposed
now
that
she
should
go
there
to
wait
till
a
poor
man
should
have
got
together
shillings
enough
to
buy
a
few
chairs
and
tables
and
a
bed
to
lie
upon
the
thought
of
this
was
very
bitter
i
can
not
think
nora
how
you
could
have
the
heart
to
go
there
said
lady
rowley
i
can
not
understand
why
not
mamma
caroline
and
i
are
friends
and
surely
he
and
i
need
not
be
enemies
he
has
never
injured
me
and
if
he
does
not
take
offence
why
should
i
if
you
do
see
it
i
ca
help
it
said
lady
rowley
and
then
spalding
triumph
was
terrible
to
lady
rowley
spalding
knew
nothing
of
her
future
former
passion
and
spoke
of
her
caroline
as
having
achieved
triumphs
beyond
the
reach
of
other
girls
lady
rowley
bore
it
never
absolutely
telling
the
tale
of
her
daughter
fruitless
victory
she
was
too
good
at
heart
to
utter
the
boast
but
it
was
very
hard
to
repress
it
upon
the
whole
she
would
have
preferred
that
glascock
and
his
bride
should
not
have
become
the
fast
friends
of
herself
and
her
family
there
was
more
of
pain
than
of
pleasure
in
the
alliance
but
circumstances
had
been
too
strong
for
her
glascock
had
been
of
great
use
in
reference
to
trevelyan
and
caroline
and
nora
had
become
attached
to
each
other
almost
on
their
first
acquaintance
here
they
were
together
at
the
baths
of
lucca
and
nora
was
to
be
one
of
the
four
bridesmaids
when
sir
marmaduke
was
consulted
about
this
visit
to
monkhams
he
became
fretful
and
would
give
no
answer
the
marriage
he
said
was
impossible
and
nora
was
a
fool
he
could
give
her
no
allowance
more
than
would
suffice
for
her
clothes
and
it
was
madness
for
her
to
think
of
stopping
in
england
but
he
was
so
full
of
cares
that
he
could
come
to
no
absolute
decision
on
this
matter
nora
however
had
come
to
a
very
absolute
decision
caroline
she
said
if
you
will
have
me
i
will
go
to
monkhams
of
course
we
will
have
you
has
not
charles
said
how
delighted
he
would
be
oh
yes
your
charles
said
nora
laughing
he
is
mine
now
dear
you
must
not
expect
him
to
change
his
mind
again
i
gave
him
the
chance
you
know
and
he
would
not
take
it
but
nora
come
to
monkhams
and
stay
as
long
as
it
suits
i
have
talked
it
all
over
with
him
and
we
both
agree
that
you
shall
have
a
home
there
you
shall
be
just
like
a
sister
olivia
is
coming
too
after
a
bit
but
he
says
there
is
room
for
a
dozen
sisters
of
course
it
will
be
all
right
with
stanbury
after
a
while
and
so
it
was
settled
among
them
that
nora
rowley
should
find
a
home
at
monkhams
if
a
home
in
england
should
be
wanted
for
her
it
wanted
but
four
days
to
that
fixed
for
the
marriage
at
florence
and
but
six
to
that
on
which
the
rowleys
were
to
leave
italy
for
england
when
glascock
received
trevelyan
letter
it
was
brought
to
him
as
he
was
sitting
at
a
late
breakfast
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
and
there
were
present
at
the
moment
not
only
all
the
spalding
family
but
the
rowleys
also
sir
marmaduke
was
there
and
lady
rowley
and
the
three
unmarried
daughters
but
trevelyan
as
was
her
wont
had
remained
alone
in
her
own
room
glascock
read
the
letter
and
read
it
again
without
attracting
much
attention
caroline
who
was
of
course
sitting
next
to
him
had
her
eyes
upon
him
and
could
see
that
the
letter
moved
him
but
she
was
not
curious
and
at
any
rate
asked
no
question
he
himself
understood
fully
how
great
was
the
offer
made
how
to
the
happiness
of
the
poor
mother
and
he
was
also
aware
or
thought
that
he
was
aware
how
likely
it
might
be
that
the
offer
would
be
retracted
as
regarded
himself
a
journey
from
the
baths
at
lucca
to
casalunga
and
back
before
his
marriage
would
be
a
great
infliction
on
his
patience
it
was
his
plan
to
stay
where
he
was
till
the
day
before
his
marriage
and
then
to
return
to
florence
with
the
rest
of
the
party
all
this
must
be
altered
and
sudden
changes
must
be
made
if
he
decided
on
going
to
siena
himself
the
weather
now
was
very
hot
and
such
a
journey
would
be
most
disagreeable
to
him
of
course
he
had
little
schemes
in
his
head
little
amatory
schemes
for
prænuptial
enjoyment
which
in
spite
of
his
mature
years
were
exceedingly
agreeable
to
him
the
chestnut
woods
round
the
baths
of
lucca
are
very
pleasant
in
the
early
summer
and
there
were
excursions
planned
in
which
caroline
would
be
close
to
his
side
almost
already
his
wife
but
if
he
did
not
go
whom
could
he
send
it
would
be
necessary
at
least
that
he
should
consult
her
the
mother
of
the
child
before
any
decision
was
formed
at
last
he
took
lady
rowley
aside
and
read
to
her
the
letter
she
understood
at
once
that
it
opened
almost
a
heaven
of
bliss
to
her
daughter
and
she
understood
also
how
probable
it
might
be
that
that
wretched
man
with
his
shaken
wits
should
change
his
mind
i
think
i
ought
to
go
said
glascock
but
how
can
you
go
now
i
can
go
said
he
there
is
time
for
it
it
need
not
put
off
my
marriage
to
which
of
course
i
could
not
consent
i
do
not
know
whom
i
could
send
monnier
could
go
said
lady
rowley
naming
the
courier
yes
he
could
go
but
it
might
be
that
he
would
return
without
the
child
and
then
we
should
not
forgive
ourselves
i
will
go
lady
rowley
after
all
what
does
it
signify
i
am
a
little
old
i
sometimes
think
for
this
philandering
you
shall
take
this
letter
to
your
daughter
and
i
will
explain
it
all
to
caroline
caroline
had
not
a
word
to
say
she
could
only
kiss
him
and
promise
to
make
him
what
amends
she
could
when
he
came
back
of
course
you
are
right
she
said
do
you
think
that
i
would
say
a
word
against
it
even
though
the
marriage
were
to
be
postponed
i
should
a
good
many
words
but
i
will
be
back
in
time
for
that
and
will
bring
the
boy
with
me
trevelyan
when
her
husband
letter
was
read
to
her
was
almost
overcome
by
the
feelings
which
it
excited
in
her
first
paroxysm
of
joy
she
declared
that
she
would
herself
go
to
siena
not
for
her
child
sake
but
for
that
of
her
husband
she
felt
at
once
that
the
boy
was
being
given
up
because
of
the
father
weakness
because
he
felt
himself
to
be
unable
to
be
a
protector
to
his
son
and
her
woman
heart
was
melted
with
softness
as
she
thought
of
the
condition
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
once
given
her
whole
heart
since
then
doubtless
her
heart
had
revolted
from
him
since
that
time
there
had
come
hours
in
which
she
had
almost
hated
him
for
his
cruelty
to
her
there
had
been
moments
in
which
she
had
almost
cursed
his
name
because
of
the
aspersion
which
it
had
seemed
that
he
had
thrown
upon
her
but
this
was
now
forgotten
and
she
remembered
only
his
weakness
mamma
she
said
i
will
go
it
is
my
duty
to
go
to
him
but
lady
rowley
withheld
her
explaining
that
were
she
to
go
the
mission
might
probably
fail
in
its
express
purpose
let
louey
be
sent
to
us
first
said
lady
rowley
and
then
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
afterwards
and
so
glascock
started
taking
with
him
a
who
might
help
him
with
the
charge
of
the
child
it
was
certainly
very
hard
upon
him
in
order
to
have
time
for
his
journey
to
siena
and
back
and
time
also
to
go
out
to
casalunga
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
leave
the
baths
at
five
in
the
morning
if
ever
there
was
a
hero
of
romance
you
are
he
said
nora
to
him
the
heroes
of
life
are
so
much
better
than
the
heroes
of
romance
said
caroline
that
is
a
lesson
from
the
lips
of
the
american
browning
said
glascock
nevertheless
i
think
i
would
rather
ride
a
charge
against
a
paynim
knight
in
palestine
than
get
up
at
four
in
the
morning
we
will
get
up
too
and
give
the
knight
his
coffee
said
nora
they
did
get
up
and
saw
him
off
and
when
glascock
and
caroline
parted
with
a
lover
embrace
nora
stood
by
as
a
sister
might
have
done
let
us
hope
that
she
remembered
that
her
own
time
was
coming
there
had
been
a
promise
given
by
nora
when
she
left
london
that
she
would
not
correspond
with
hugh
stanbury
while
she
was
in
italy
and
this
promise
had
been
kept
it
may
be
remembered
that
hugh
had
made
a
proposition
to
his
that
she
should
walk
out
of
the
house
one
fine
morning
and
get
herself
married
without
any
reference
to
her
father
or
her
mother
wishes
but
she
had
not
been
willing
to
take
upon
herself
as
yet
independence
so
complete
as
this
would
have
required
she
had
assured
her
lover
that
she
did
mean
to
marry
him
some
day
even
though
it
should
be
in
opposition
to
her
father
but
that
she
thought
that
the
period
for
filial
persuasion
was
not
yet
over
and
then
in
explaining
all
this
to
her
mother
she
had
given
a
promise
neither
to
write
nor
to
receive
letters
during
the
short
period
of
her
sojourn
in
italy
she
would
be
an
obedient
child
for
so
long
but
after
that
she
must
claim
the
right
to
fight
her
own
battle
she
had
told
her
lover
that
he
must
not
write
and
of
course
she
had
not
written
a
word
herself
but
now
when
her
mother
threw
it
in
her
teeth
that
stanbury
would
not
be
ready
to
marry
her
she
thought
that
an
unfair
advantage
was
being
taken
of
her
and
of
him
how
could
he
be
expected
to
say
that
he
was
ready
deprived
as
he
was
of
the
power
of
saying
anything
at
all
mamma
she
said
the
day
before
they
went
to
florence
has
papa
fixed
about
your
leaving
england
yet
i
suppose
you
go
now
on
the
last
saturday
in
july
i
suppose
we
shall
my
dear
has
not
papa
written
about
the
berths
i
believe
he
has
my
dear
because
he
ought
to
know
who
are
going
i
will
not
go
you
will
not
nora
is
that
a
proper
way
of
speaking
dear
mamma
i
mean
it
to
be
proper
i
hope
it
is
proper
but
is
it
not
best
that
we
should
understand
each
other
all
my
life
depends
on
my
going
or
my
staying
now
i
must
decide
after
what
has
passed
you
do
not
i
suppose
mean
to
live
in
glascock
house
certainly
not
i
mean
to
live
with
with
with
my
husband
mamma
i
promised
not
to
write
and
i
have
not
written
and
he
has
not
written
because
i
told
him
not
therefore
nothing
is
settled
but
it
is
not
fair
to
throw
it
in
my
teeth
that
nothing
is
settled
i
have
thrown
nothing
in
your
teeth
nora
papa
talks
sneeringly
about
chairs
and
tables
of
course
i
know
what
he
is
thinking
of
as
i
can
not
go
with
him
to
the
mandarins
i
think
i
ought
to
be
allowed
to
look
after
the
chairs
and
tables
what
do
you
mean
my
dear
that
you
should
absolve
me
from
my
promise
and
let
me
write
to
stanbury
i
do
not
want
to
be
left
without
a
home
you
can
not
wish
to
write
to
a
gentleman
and
ask
him
to
marry
you
why
not
we
are
engaged
i
shall
not
ask
him
to
marry
me
that
is
already
settled
but
i
shall
ask
him
to
make
arrangements
your
papa
will
be
very
angry
if
you
break
your
word
to
him
i
will
write
and
show
you
the
letter
papa
may
see
it
and
if
he
will
not
let
it
go
it
shall
not
go
he
shall
not
say
that
i
broke
my
word
but
mamma
i
will
not
go
out
to
the
islands
i
should
never
get
back
again
and
i
should
be
lady
rowley
had
nothing
to
say
to
this
and
nora
went
and
wrote
her
letter
dear
hugh
the
letter
ran
papa
and
mamma
leave
england
on
the
last
saturday
in
july
i
have
told
mamma
that
i
can
not
return
with
them
of
course
you
know
why
i
stay
glascock
is
to
be
married
the
day
after
and
they
have
asked
me
to
go
with
them
to
monkhams
some
time
in
august
i
think
i
shall
do
so
unless
emily
wants
me
to
remain
with
her
at
any
rate
i
shall
try
to
be
with
her
till
i
go
there
you
will
understand
why
i
tell
you
all
this
papa
and
mamma
know
that
i
am
writing
it
is
only
a
business
letter
and
therefore
i
shall
say
no
more
except
that
i
am
ever
and
always
yours
nora
there
she
said
handing
her
letter
to
her
mother
i
think
that
that
ought
to
be
sent
if
papa
chooses
to
prevent
its
going
he
can
lady
rowley
when
she
handed
the
letter
to
her
husband
recommended
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
go
to
its
destination
she
admitted
that
if
they
sent
it
they
would
thereby
signify
their
consent
to
her
engagement
and
she
alleged
that
nora
was
so
strong
in
her
will
and
that
the
circumstances
of
their
journey
out
to
the
antipodes
were
so
peculiar
that
it
was
of
no
avail
for
them
any
longer
to
oppose
the
match
they
could
not
force
their
daughter
to
go
with
them
but
i
can
cast
her
off
from
me
if
she
be
disobedient
said
sir
marmaduke
lady
rowley
however
had
no
desire
that
her
daughter
should
be
cast
off
and
was
aware
that
sir
marmaduke
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
casting
off
would
be
as
little
inclined
to
be
stern
as
she
was
herself
sir
marmaduke
still
hoping
that
firmness
would
carry
the
day
and
believing
that
it
behoved
him
to
maintain
his
parental
authority
ended
the
discussion
by
keeping
possession
of
the
letter
and
saying
that
he
would
take
time
to
consider
the
matter
what
security
have
we
that
he
will
ever
marry
her
if
she
does
stay
he
asked
the
next
morning
lady
rowley
had
no
doubt
on
this
score
and
protested
that
her
opposition
to
hugh
stanbury
arose
simply
from
his
want
of
income
i
should
never
be
justified
said
sir
marmaduke
if
i
were
to
go
and
leave
my
girl
as
it
were
in
the
hands
of
a
the
letter
in
the
end
was
not
sent
and
nora
and
her
father
hardly
spoke
to
each
other
as
they
made
their
journey
back
to
florence
together
emily
trevelyan
before
the
arrival
of
that
letter
from
her
husband
had
determined
that
she
would
not
leave
italy
it
had
been
her
purpose
to
remain
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
her
husband
and
child
and
to
overcome
her
difficulties
or
be
overcome
by
them
as
circumstances
might
direct
now
her
plans
were
again
changed
or
rather
she
was
now
without
a
plan
she
could
form
no
plan
till
she
should
again
see
glascock
should
her
child
be
restored
to
her
would
it
not
be
her
duty
to
remain
near
her
husband
all
this
made
nora
line
of
conduct
the
more
difficult
for
her
it
was
acknowledged
that
she
could
not
remain
in
italy
position
would
be
most
embarrassing
but
as
all
her
efforts
were
to
be
used
towards
a
reconciliation
with
her
husband
and
as
his
state
utterly
precluded
the
idea
of
a
mixed
household
of
any
such
a
family
arrangement
as
that
which
had
existed
in
curzon
street
nora
could
not
remain
with
her
trevelyan
herself
had
declared
that
she
would
not
wish
it
and
in
that
case
where
was
nora
to
bestow
herself
when
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
had
sailed
caroline
offered
to
curtail
those
honeymoon
weeks
in
switzerland
but
it
was
impossible
to
listen
to
an
offer
so
magnanimous
and
so
unreasonable
nora
had
a
dim
romantic
idea
of
sharing
priscilla
in
that
small
cottage
near
nuncombe
putney
of
which
she
had
heard
and
of
there
learning
lessons
in
strict
economy
but
of
this
she
said
nothing
the
short
journey
from
the
baths
of
lucca
to
florence
was
not
a
pleasant
one
and
the
rowley
family
were
much
disturbed
as
they
looked
into
the
future
lodgings
had
now
been
taken
for
them
and
there
was
the
great
additional
doubt
whether
trevelyan
would
find
her
child
there
on
her
arrival
the
spaldings
went
one
way
from
the
florence
station
and
the
rowleys
another
the
american
minister
had
returned
to
the
city
some
days
previously
drawn
there
nominally
by
pleas
of
business
but
in
truth
by
the
necessities
of
the
wedding
breakfast
and
he
met
them
at
the
station
has
glascock
come
back
nora
was
the
first
to
ask
yes
he
had
come
he
had
been
in
the
city
since
two
and
had
been
up
at
the
american
minister
house
for
half
a
minute
and
has
he
brought
the
child
asked
caroline
relieved
of
doubt
on
her
own
account
spalding
did
not
know
indeed
he
had
not
interested
himself
quite
so
intently
about
trevelyan
little
boy
as
had
all
those
who
had
just
returned
from
the
baths
glascock
had
said
nothing
to
him
about
the
child
and
he
had
not
quite
understood
why
such
a
man
should
have
made
a
journey
to
siena
leaving
his
sweetheart
behind
him
just
on
the
eve
of
his
marriage
he
hurried
his
into
their
carriage
and
they
were
driven
away
and
then
sir
marmaduke
was
driven
away
with
his
caroline
spalding
had
perhaps
thought
that
glascock
might
have
been
there
to
meet
her
chapter
lxxxvi
glascock
as
nurse
a
message
had
been
sent
by
the
wires
to
trevelyan
to
let
him
know
that
glascock
was
himself
coming
for
the
boy
whether
such
message
would
or
would
not
be
sent
out
to
casalunga
glascock
had
been
quite
ignorant
but
it
could
at
any
rate
do
no
harm
he
did
feel
it
hard
as
in
this
hot
weather
he
made
the
journey
first
to
florence
and
then
on
to
siena
what
was
he
to
the
rowleys
or
to
trevelyan
himself
that
such
a
job
of
work
should
fall
to
his
lot
at
such
a
period
of
his
life
he
had
been
very
much
in
love
with
nora
no
doubt
but
luckily
for
him
as
he
thought
nora
had
refused
him
as
for
trevelyan
trevelyan
had
never
been
his
friend
as
for
sir
marmaduke
sir
marmaduke
was
nothing
to
him
he
was
almost
angry
even
with
trevelyan
as
he
arrived
tired
heated
and
very
dusty
at
siena
it
was
his
purpose
to
sleep
at
siena
that
night
and
to
go
out
to
casalunga
early
the
next
morning
if
the
telegram
had
not
been
forwarded
he
would
send
a
message
on
that
evening
on
inquiry
however
he
found
that
the
message
had
been
sent
and
that
the
paper
had
been
put
into
the
signore
own
hand
by
the
sienese
messenger
then
he
got
into
some
discourse
with
the
landlord
about
the
strange
gentleman
at
casalunga
trevelyan
was
beginning
to
become
the
subject
of
gossip
in
the
town
and
people
were
saying
that
the
stranger
was
very
strange
indeed
the
landlord
thought
that
if
the
signore
had
any
friends
at
all
it
would
be
well
that
such
friends
should
come
and
look
after
him
glascock
asked
if
trevelyan
was
ill
it
was
not
only
that
the
signore
was
out
of
health
so
the
landlord
heard
but
that
he
was
also
somewhat
and
then
the
landlord
touched
his
head
he
eat
nothing
and
went
nowhere
and
spoke
to
no
one
and
the
people
at
the
hospital
to
which
casalunga
belonged
were
beginning
to
be
uneasy
about
their
tenant
perhaps
glascock
had
come
to
take
him
away
glascock
explained
that
he
had
not
come
to
take
trevelyan
away
but
only
to
take
away
a
little
boy
that
was
with
him
for
this
reason
he
was
travelling
with
a
a
fact
for
which
glascock
clearly
thought
it
necessary
that
he
should
give
an
intelligible
and
credible
explanation
the
landlord
seemed
to
think
that
the
people
at
the
hospital
would
have
been
much
rejoiced
had
glascock
intended
to
take
trevelyan
away
also
he
started
after
a
very
early
breakfast
and
found
himself
walking
up
over
the
stone
ridges
to
the
house
between
nine
and
ten
in
the
morning
he
himself
had
sat
beside
the
driver
and
had
put
the
maid
inside
the
carriage
he
had
not
deemed
it
wise
to
take
an
undivided
charge
of
the
boy
even
from
casalunga
to
siena
at
the
door
of
the
house
as
though
waiting
for
him
he
found
trevelyan
not
dirty
as
he
had
been
before
but
dressed
with
much
appearance
of
smartness
he
had
a
brocaded
cap
on
his
head
and
a
shirt
with
a
laced
front
and
a
worked
waistcoat
and
a
frock
coat
and
coloured
bright
trousers
glascock
knew
at
once
that
all
the
clothes
which
he
saw
before
him
had
been
made
for
italian
and
not
for
english
wear
and
could
almost
have
said
that
they
had
been
bought
in
siena
and
not
in
florence
i
had
not
intended
to
impose
this
labour
on
you
glascock
trevelyan
said
raising
his
cap
to
salute
his
visitor
for
fear
there
might
be
mistakes
i
thought
it
better
to
come
myself
said
glascock
you
did
not
wish
to
see
sir
marmaduke
certainly
not
sir
marmaduke
said
trevelyan
with
a
look
of
anger
that
was
almost
grotesque
and
you
thought
it
better
that
trevelyan
should
not
come
yes
i
thought
it
better
but
not
from
any
feeling
of
anger
towards
her
if
i
could
welcome
my
wife
here
glascock
without
a
risk
of
wrath
on
her
part
i
should
be
very
happy
to
receive
her
i
love
my
wife
glascock
i
love
her
dearly
but
there
have
been
misfortunes
never
mind
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
trouble
you
with
them
let
us
go
in
to
breakfast
after
your
drive
you
will
have
an
appetite
poor
glascock
was
afraid
to
decline
to
sit
down
to
the
meal
which
was
prepared
for
him
he
did
mutter
something
about
having
already
eaten
but
trevelyan
put
this
aside
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
as
he
led
the
way
into
a
spacious
room
in
which
had
been
set
out
a
table
with
almost
a
sumptuous
banquet
the
room
was
very
bare
and
comfortless
having
neither
curtains
nor
matting
and
containing
not
above
half
a
dozen
chairs
but
an
effort
had
been
made
to
give
it
an
air
of
italian
luxury
the
windows
were
thrown
open
down
to
the
ground
and
the
table
was
decorated
with
fruits
and
three
or
four
bottles
trevelyan
waved
with
his
hand
towards
an
and
glascock
had
no
alternative
but
to
seat
himself
he
felt
that
he
was
sitting
down
to
breakfast
with
a
madman
but
if
he
did
not
sit
down
the
madman
might
perhaps
break
out
into
madness
then
trevelyan
went
to
the
door
and
called
aloud
for
catarina
in
these
remote
places
said
he
one
has
to
do
without
the
civilisation
of
a
bell
perhaps
one
gains
as
much
in
quiet
as
one
loses
in
comfort
then
catarina
came
with
hot
meats
and
fried
potatoes
and
glascock
was
compelled
to
help
himself
i
am
but
a
bad
trencherman
myself
said
trevelyan
but
i
shall
lament
my
misfortune
doubly
if
that
should
interfere
with
your
appetite
then
he
got
up
and
poured
out
wine
into
glass
they
tell
me
that
it
comes
from
the
baron
vineyard
said
trevelyan
alluding
to
the
of
ricasoli
and
that
there
is
none
better
in
tuscany
i
never
was
myself
a
judge
of
the
grape
but
this
to
me
is
as
palatable
as
any
of
the
costlier
french
wines
how
grand
a
thing
would
wine
really
be
if
it
could
make
glad
the
heart
of
man
how
truly
would
one
worship
bacchus
if
he
could
make
heart
to
rejoice
but
if
a
man
have
a
real
sorrow
wine
will
not
wash
it
away
not
though
a
man
were
drowned
in
it
as
clarence
was
glascock
hitherto
had
spoken
hardly
a
word
there
was
an
attempt
at
joviality
about
this
breakfast
or
at
any
rate
of
the
usual
comfortable
luxury
of
hospitable
entertainment
which
coming
as
it
did
from
trevelyan
almost
locked
his
lips
he
had
not
come
there
to
be
jovial
or
luxurious
but
to
perform
a
most
melancholy
mission
and
he
had
brought
with
him
his
saddest
looks
and
was
prepared
for
a
few
sad
words
trevelyan
speech
indeed
was
sad
enough
but
glascock
could
not
take
up
questions
of
the
worship
of
bacchus
at
half
a
minute
warning
he
eat
a
morsel
and
raised
his
glass
to
his
lips
and
felt
himself
to
be
very
uncomfortable
it
was
necessary
however
that
he
should
utter
a
word
do
you
not
let
your
little
boy
come
in
to
breakfast
he
said
he
is
better
away
said
trevelyan
gloomily
but
as
we
are
to
travel
together
said
glascock
we
might
as
well
make
acquaintance
you
have
been
a
little
hurried
with
me
on
that
score
said
trevelyan
i
wrote
certainly
with
a
determined
mind
but
things
have
changed
somewhat
since
then
you
do
not
mean
that
you
will
not
send
him
you
have
been
somewhat
hurried
with
me
i
say
if
i
remember
rightly
i
named
no
time
but
spoke
of
the
future
could
i
have
answered
the
message
which
i
received
from
you
i
would
have
postponed
your
visit
for
a
week
or
so
postponed
it
why
i
am
to
be
married
the
day
after
it
was
just
as
much
as
i
was
able
to
do
to
come
here
at
all
glascock
now
pushed
his
chair
back
from
the
table
and
prepared
himself
to
speak
up
your
wife
expects
her
child
now
and
you
will
break
her
heart
by
refusing
to
send
him
nobody
thinks
of
my
heart
mr
glascock
but
this
is
your
own
offer
yes
it
was
my
own
offer
certainly
i
am
not
going
to
deny
my
own
words
which
have
no
doubt
been
preserved
in
testimony
against
me
trevelyan
what
do
you
mean
then
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
boiling
over
with
passion
glascock
remembered
that
his
companion
was
not
responsible
for
his
expressions
i
do
hope
you
will
let
the
child
go
away
with
me
he
said
you
can
not
conceive
the
state
of
his
mother
anxiety
and
she
will
send
him
back
at
once
if
you
demand
it
is
that
to
be
in
good
faith
certainly
in
good
faith
i
would
lend
myself
to
nothing
trevelyan
that
was
not
said
and
done
in
good
faith
she
will
not
break
her
word
excusing
herself
because
i
am
mad
i
am
sure
that
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
in
her
mind
perhaps
not
now
but
such
things
grow
there
is
no
iniquity
no
breach
of
promise
no
treason
that
a
woman
will
not
excuse
to
herself
or
a
man
either
by
the
comfortable
that
the
person
to
be
injured
is
mad
a
hound
without
a
friend
is
not
so
cruelly
treated
the
outlaw
the
murderer
the
perjurer
has
surer
privileges
than
the
man
who
is
in
the
way
and
to
whom
his
friends
can
point
as
being
mad
glascock
knew
or
thought
that
he
knew
that
his
host
in
truth
was
mad
and
he
could
not
therefore
answer
this
tirade
by
an
assurance
that
no
such
idea
was
likely
to
prevail
have
they
told
you
i
wonder
continued
trevelyan
how
it
was
that
driven
to
force
and
an
ambuscade
for
the
recovery
of
my
own
child
i
waylaid
my
wife
and
took
him
from
her
i
have
done
nothing
to
forfeit
my
right
as
a
man
to
the
control
of
my
own
family
i
demanded
that
the
boy
should
be
sent
to
me
and
she
paid
no
attention
to
my
words
i
was
compelled
to
vindicate
my
own
authority
and
then
because
i
claimed
the
right
which
belongs
to
a
father
they
said
that
i
was
mad
ay
and
they
would
have
proved
it
too
had
i
not
fled
from
my
country
and
hidden
myself
in
this
desert
think
of
that
glascock
now
they
have
followed
me
here
not
out
of
love
for
me
and
that
man
whom
they
call
a
governor
comes
and
insults
me
and
my
wife
promises
to
be
good
to
me
and
says
that
she
will
forgive
and
forget
can
she
ever
forgive
herself
her
own
folly
and
the
cruelty
that
has
made
shipwreck
of
my
life
they
can
do
nothing
to
me
here
but
they
would
entice
me
home
because
there
they
have
friends
and
can
fee
doctors
with
my
own
money
and
suborn
lawyers
and
put
me
away
somewhere
in
the
dark
where
i
shall
be
no
more
heard
of
among
men
as
you
are
a
man
of
honour
glascock
tell
me
is
it
not
so
i
know
nothing
of
their
plans
beyond
this
that
you
wrote
me
word
that
you
would
send
them
the
boy
but
i
know
their
plans
what
you
say
is
true
i
did
write
you
word
and
i
meant
it
glascock
sitting
here
alone
from
morning
to
night
and
lying
down
from
night
till
morning
without
companionship
without
love
in
utter
misery
i
taught
myself
to
feel
that
i
should
think
more
of
her
than
of
myself
if
you
are
so
unhappy
here
come
back
yourself
with
the
child
your
wife
would
desire
nothing
better
yes
and
submit
to
her
and
her
father
and
her
mother
no
glascock
never
never
let
her
come
to
me
but
you
will
not
receive
her
let
her
come
in
a
proper
spirit
and
i
will
receive
her
she
is
the
wife
of
my
bosom
and
i
will
receive
her
with
joy
but
if
she
is
to
come
to
me
and
tell
me
that
she
forgives
me
forgives
me
for
the
evil
that
she
has
done
then
sir
she
had
better
stay
away
glascock
you
are
going
to
be
married
believe
me
no
man
should
submit
to
be
forgiven
by
his
wife
everything
must
go
astray
if
that
be
done
i
would
rather
encounter
their
mad
doctors
one
of
them
after
another
till
they
had
made
me
mad
i
would
encounter
anything
rather
than
that
but
sir
you
neither
eat
nor
drink
and
i
fear
that
my
speech
disturbs
you
it
was
like
enough
that
it
may
have
done
so
trevelyan
as
he
had
been
speaking
had
walked
about
the
room
going
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
with
hurried
steps
gesticulating
with
his
arms
and
every
now
and
then
pushing
back
with
his
hands
the
long
hair
from
off
his
forehead
glascock
was
in
truth
very
much
disturbed
he
had
come
there
with
an
express
object
but
whenever
he
mentioned
the
child
the
father
became
almost
rabid
in
his
wrath
i
have
done
very
well
thank
you
said
glascock
i
will
not
eat
any
more
and
i
believe
i
must
be
thinking
of
going
back
to
siena
i
had
hoped
you
would
spend
the
day
with
me
mr
glascock
i
am
to
be
married
you
see
in
two
days
and
i
must
be
in
florence
early
i
am
to
meet
my
wife
as
she
will
be
and
the
rowleys
and
your
wife
upon
my
word
i
ca
stay
wo
you
just
say
a
word
to
the
young
woman
and
let
the
boy
be
got
ready
i
think
not
no
i
think
not
and
am
i
to
have
had
all
this
journey
for
nothing
you
will
have
made
a
fool
of
me
in
writing
to
me
i
intended
to
be
honest
mr
glascock
stick
to
your
honesty
and
send
the
boy
back
to
his
mother
it
will
be
better
for
you
trevelyan
better
for
me
nothing
can
be
better
for
me
all
must
be
worst
it
will
be
better
for
me
you
say
and
you
ask
me
to
give
up
the
last
drop
of
cold
water
wherewith
i
can
touch
my
parched
lips
even
in
my
hell
i
had
so
much
left
to
me
of
a
limpid
stream
and
you
tell
me
that
it
will
be
better
for
me
to
pour
it
away
you
may
take
him
glascock
the
woman
will
make
him
ready
for
you
what
matters
it
whether
the
fiery
furnace
be
heated
seven
times
or
only
six
in
either
degree
the
flames
are
enough
you
may
take
him
you
may
take
him
so
saying
trevelyan
walked
out
of
the
window
leaving
glascock
seated
in
his
chair
he
walked
out
of
the
window
and
went
down
among
the
olive
trees
he
did
not
go
far
however
but
stood
with
his
arm
round
the
stem
of
one
of
them
playing
with
the
shoots
of
a
vine
with
his
hand
glascock
followed
him
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
at
him
for
a
few
moments
but
trevelyan
did
not
turn
or
move
there
he
stood
gazing
at
the
pale
cloudless
motionless
sky
thinking
of
his
own
sorrows
and
remembering
too
doubtless
with
the
vanity
of
a
madman
that
he
was
probably
being
watched
in
his
reverie
glascock
was
too
practical
a
man
not
to
make
the
most
of
the
offer
that
had
been
made
to
him
and
he
went
back
among
the
passages
and
called
for
catarina
before
long
he
had
two
or
three
women
with
him
including
her
whom
he
had
brought
from
florence
and
among
them
louey
was
soon
made
to
appear
dressed
for
his
journey
together
with
a
small
trunk
in
which
were
his
garments
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
order
for
his
departure
had
been
given
before
that
scene
at
the
and
that
trevelyan
had
not
intended
to
go
back
from
his
promise
nevertheless
glascock
thought
it
might
be
as
well
to
hurry
his
departure
and
he
turned
back
to
say
the
shortest
possible
word
of
farewell
to
trevelyan
in
the
garden
but
when
he
got
to
the
window
trevelyan
was
not
to
be
found
among
the
olive
trees
glascock
walked
a
few
steps
down
the
hill
looking
for
him
but
seeing
nothing
of
him
returned
to
the
house
the
elder
woman
said
that
her
master
had
not
been
there
and
glascock
started
with
his
charge
trevelyan
was
manifestly
mad
and
it
was
impossible
to
treat
him
as
a
sane
man
would
have
been
treated
nevertheless
glascock
felt
much
compunction
in
carrying
the
child
away
without
a
final
kiss
or
word
of
farewell
from
its
father
but
it
was
not
to
be
so
he
had
got
into
the
carriage
with
the
child
having
the
servant
seated
opposite
to
him
for
he
was
moved
by
some
undefinable
fear
which
made
him
determine
to
keep
the
boy
close
to
him
and
he
had
not
therefore
returned
to
the
driver
seat
when
trevelyan
appeared
standing
by
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
would
you
take
him
away
from
me
without
one
word
said
trevelyan
bitterly
i
went
to
look
for
you
but
you
were
gone
said
glascock
no
sir
i
was
not
gone
i
am
here
it
is
the
last
time
that
i
shall
ever
gladden
my
eyes
with
his
brightness
louey
my
love
will
you
come
to
your
father
louey
did
not
seem
to
be
particularly
willing
to
leave
the
carriage
but
he
made
no
loud
objection
when
glascock
held
him
up
to
the
open
space
above
the
door
the
child
had
realised
the
fact
that
he
was
to
go
and
did
not
believe
that
his
father
would
stop
him
now
but
he
was
probably
of
opinion
that
the
sooner
the
carriage
began
to
go
on
the
better
it
would
be
for
him
glascock
thinking
that
his
father
intended
to
kiss
him
over
the
door
held
him
by
his
frock
but
the
doing
of
this
made
trevelyan
very
angry
am
i
not
to
be
trusted
with
my
own
child
in
my
arms
said
he
give
him
to
me
sir
i
begin
to
doubt
now
whether
i
am
right
to
deliver
him
to
you
glascock
immediately
let
go
his
hold
of
the
boy
frock
and
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
louey
will
tell
papa
that
he
loves
him
before
he
goes
said
trevelyan
the
poor
little
fellow
murmured
something
but
it
did
not
please
his
father
who
had
him
in
his
arms
you
are
like
the
rest
of
them
louey
he
said
because
i
can
not
laugh
and
be
gay
all
my
love
for
you
is
nothing
nothing
you
may
take
him
he
is
all
that
i
have
all
that
i
have
and
i
shall
never
see
him
again
so
saying
he
handed
the
child
into
the
carriage
and
sat
himself
down
by
the
side
of
the
road
to
watch
till
the
vehicle
should
be
out
of
sight
as
soon
as
the
last
speck
of
it
had
vanished
from
his
sight
he
picked
himself
up
and
dragged
his
slow
footsteps
back
to
the
house
glascock
made
sundry
attempts
to
amuse
the
child
with
whom
he
had
to
remain
all
that
night
at
siena
but
his
efforts
in
that
line
were
not
very
successful
the
boy
was
brisk
enough
and
happy
and
social
by
nature
but
the
events
or
rather
the
want
of
events
of
the
last
few
months
had
so
cowed
him
that
he
could
not
recover
his
spirits
at
the
bidding
of
a
stranger
if
i
have
any
of
my
own
said
glascock
to
himself
i
hope
they
will
be
of
a
more
cheerful
disposition
as
we
have
seen
he
did
not
meet
caroline
at
the
station
thereby
incurring
his
displeasure
for
the
period
of
but
he
did
meet
trevelyan
almost
at
the
door
of
sir
marmaduke
lodgings
yes
trevelyan
he
is
here
how
am
i
ever
to
thank
you
for
such
goodness
said
she
and
trevelyan
you
saw
him
yes
i
saw
him
before
he
could
answer
her
further
she
was
and
had
her
child
in
her
arms
it
seemed
to
be
an
age
since
the
boy
had
been
stolen
from
her
in
the
early
spring
in
that
unknown
dingy
street
near
tottenham
court
road
twice
she
had
seen
her
darling
since
that
twice
during
his
captivity
but
on
each
of
these
occasions
she
had
seen
him
as
one
not
belonging
to
herself
and
had
seen
him
under
circumstances
which
had
robbed
the
greeting
of
almost
all
its
pleasure
but
now
he
was
her
own
again
to
take
whither
she
would
to
dress
and
to
undress
to
feed
to
coax
to
teach
and
to
caress
and
the
child
lay
close
up
to
her
as
she
hugged
him
putting
up
his
little
cheek
to
her
chin
and
burying
himself
happily
in
her
embrace
he
had
not
much
as
yet
to
say
but
she
could
feel
that
he
was
contented
glascock
had
promised
to
wait
for
her
a
few
minutes
even
at
the
risk
of
caroline
displeasure
and
trevelyan
ran
down
to
him
as
soon
as
the
first
craving
of
her
mother
love
was
satisfied
her
boy
would
at
any
rate
be
safe
with
her
now
and
it
was
her
duty
to
learn
something
of
her
husband
it
was
more
than
her
duty
if
only
her
services
might
be
of
avail
to
him
and
you
say
he
was
well
she
asked
she
had
taken
glascock
apart
and
they
were
alone
together
and
he
had
determined
that
he
would
tell
her
the
truth
i
do
not
know
that
he
is
ill
though
he
is
pale
and
altered
beyond
belief
yes
i
saw
that
i
never
knew
a
man
so
thin
and
haggard
my
poor
louis
but
that
is
not
the
worst
of
it
what
do
you
mean
mr
glascock
i
mean
that
his
mind
is
astray
and
that
he
should
not
be
left
alone
there
is
no
knowing
what
he
might
do
he
is
so
much
more
alone
there
than
he
would
be
in
england
there
is
not
a
soul
who
could
interfere
do
you
mean
that
you
think
that
he
is
in
danger
from
himself
i
would
not
say
so
trevelyan
but
who
can
tell
i
am
sure
of
this
that
he
should
not
be
left
alone
if
it
were
only
because
of
the
misery
of
his
life
he
should
not
be
left
alone
but
what
can
i
do
he
would
not
even
see
papa
he
would
see
you
but
he
would
not
let
me
guide
him
in
anything
i
have
been
to
him
twice
and
he
breaks
out
as
if
i
were
a
bad
woman
let
him
break
out
what
does
it
matter
am
i
to
own
to
a
falsehood
and
such
a
falsehood
own
to
anything
and
you
will
conquer
him
at
once
that
is
what
i
think
you
will
excuse
what
i
say
mrs
trevelyan
oh
glascock
you
have
been
such
a
friend
what
should
we
have
done
without
you
you
can
not
take
to
heart
the
words
that
come
from
a
disordered
reason
in
truth
he
believes
no
ill
of
you
but
he
says
so
it
is
hard
to
know
what
he
says
declare
that
you
will
submit
to
him
and
i
think
that
he
will
be
softened
towards
you
try
to
bring
him
back
to
his
own
country
it
may
be
that
were
he
to
die
there
alone
the
memory
of
his
loneliness
would
be
heavy
with
you
in
after
days
then
having
so
spoken
he
rushed
off
declaring
with
a
forced
laugh
that
caroline
spalding
would
never
forgive
him
the
next
day
was
the
day
of
the
wedding
and
emily
trevelyan
was
left
all
alone
it
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
join
any
party
the
purport
of
which
was
to
be
festive
sir
marmaduke
went
with
some
grumbling
declaring
that
wine
and
severe
food
in
the
morning
were
sins
against
the
plainest
rules
of
life
and
the
three
rowley
girls
went
nora
officiating
as
one
of
the
bridesmaids
but
trevelyan
was
left
with
her
boy
and
during
the
day
she
was
forced
to
resolve
what
should
be
the
immediate
course
of
her
life
two
days
after
the
wedding
her
family
would
return
to
england
it
was
open
to
her
to
go
with
them
and
to
take
her
boy
with
her
but
a
few
days
since
how
happy
she
would
have
been
could
she
have
been
made
to
believe
that
such
a
mode
of
returning
would
be
within
her
power
but
now
she
felt
that
she
might
not
return
and
leave
that
poor
suffering
wretch
behind
her
as
she
thought
of
him
she
tried
to
interrogate
herself
in
regard
to
her
feelings
was
it
love
or
duty
or
compassion
which
stirred
her
she
had
loved
him
as
fondly
as
any
bright
young
woman
loves
the
man
who
is
to
take
her
away
from
everything
else
and
make
her
a
part
of
his
house
and
of
himself
she
had
loved
him
as
nora
now
loved
the
man
whom
she
worshipped
and
thought
to
be
a
god
doing
godlike
work
in
the
dingy
recesses
of
the
office
emily
trevelyan
was
forced
to
tell
herself
that
all
that
was
over
with
her
her
husband
had
shown
himself
to
be
weak
suspicious
unmanly
by
no
means
like
a
god
she
had
learned
to
feel
that
she
could
not
trust
her
comfort
in
his
hands
that
she
could
never
know
what
his
thoughts
of
her
might
be
but
still
he
was
her
husband
and
the
father
of
her
child
and
though
she
could
not
dare
to
look
forward
to
happiness
in
living
with
him
she
could
understand
that
no
comfort
would
be
possible
to
her
were
she
to
return
to
england
and
to
leave
him
to
perish
alone
at
casalunga
fate
seemed
to
have
intended
that
her
life
should
be
one
of
misery
and
she
must
bear
it
as
best
she
might
the
more
she
thought
of
it
however
the
greater
seemed
to
be
her
difficulties
what
was
she
to
do
when
her
father
and
mother
should
have
left
her
she
could
not
go
to
casalunga
if
her
husband
would
not
give
her
entrance
and
if
she
did
go
would
it
be
safe
for
her
to
take
her
boy
with
her
were
she
to
remain
in
florence
she
would
be
hardly
nearer
to
him
for
any
useful
purpose
than
in
england
and
even
should
she
pitch
her
tent
at
siena
occupying
there
some
desolate
set
of
huge
apartments
in
a
deserted
palace
of
what
use
could
she
be
to
him
could
she
stay
there
if
he
desired
her
to
go
and
was
it
probable
that
he
would
be
willing
that
she
should
be
at
siena
while
he
was
living
at
casalunga
no
more
than
two
leagues
distant
how
should
she
begin
her
work
and
if
he
repulsed
her
how
should
she
then
continue
it
but
during
these
wedding
hours
she
did
make
up
her
mind
as
to
what
she
would
do
for
the
present
she
would
certainly
not
leave
italy
while
her
husband
remained
there
she
would
for
a
while
keep
her
rooms
in
florence
and
there
should
her
boy
abide
but
from
time
to
time
twice
a
week
perhaps
she
would
go
down
to
siena
and
casalunga
and
there
form
her
plans
in
accordance
with
her
conduct
she
was
his
wife
and
nothing
should
entirely
separate
her
from
him
now
that
he
so
sorely
wanted
her
aid
chapter
lxxxvii
glascock
marriage
completed
illustration
the
glascock
marriage
was
a
great
affair
in
florence
so
much
so
that
there
were
not
a
few
who
regarded
it
as
a
strengthening
of
peaceful
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
and
who
thought
that
the
alabama
claims
and
the
question
of
naturalisation
might
now
be
settled
with
comparative
ease
an
english
lord
was
about
to
marry
the
niece
of
an
american
minister
to
a
foreign
court
the
bridegroom
was
not
indeed
quite
a
lord
as
yet
but
it
was
known
to
all
men
that
he
must
be
a
lord
in
a
very
short
time
and
the
bride
was
treated
with
more
than
usual
bridal
honours
because
she
belonged
to
a
legation
she
was
not
indeed
an
ambassador
daughter
but
the
niece
of
a
daughterless
ambassador
and
therefore
almost
as
good
as
a
daughter
the
wives
and
daughters
of
other
ambassadors
and
the
other
ambassadors
themselves
of
course
came
to
the
wedding
and
as
the
palace
in
which
spalding
had
apartments
stood
alone
in
a
garden
with
a
separate
carriage
entrance
it
seemed
for
all
wedding
purposes
as
though
the
whole
palace
were
his
own
the
english
minister
came
and
his
wife
although
she
had
never
quite
given
over
turning
up
her
nose
at
the
american
bride
whom
glascock
had
chosen
for
himself
it
was
such
a
pity
she
said
that
such
a
man
as
glascock
should
marry
a
young
woman
from
providence
rhode
island
who
in
england
would
know
anything
of
providence
rhode
island
and
it
was
so
expedient
in
her
estimation
that
a
man
of
family
should
strengthen
himself
by
marrying
a
woman
of
family
it
was
so
necessary
she
declared
that
a
man
when
marrying
should
remember
that
his
child
would
have
two
grandfathers
and
would
be
called
upon
to
account
for
four
nevertheless
glascock
was
glascock
and
let
him
marry
whom
he
would
his
wife
would
be
the
future
lady
peterborough
remembering
this
the
english
minister
wife
gave
up
the
point
when
the
thing
was
really
settled
and
benignly
promised
to
come
to
the
breakfast
with
all
the
secretaries
and
attachés
belonging
to
the
legation
and
all
the
wives
and
daughters
thereof
what
may
a
man
not
do
and
do
with
éclat
if
he
be
heir
to
a
peer
and
have
plenty
of
money
in
his
pocket
and
spalding
were
covered
with
glory
on
the
occasion
and
perhaps
they
did
not
bear
their
glory
as
meekly
as
they
should
have
done
spalding
laid
herself
open
to
some
ridicule
from
the
british
minister
wife
because
of
her
inability
to
understand
with
absolute
clearness
the
condition
of
her
niece
husband
in
respect
to
his
late
and
future
seat
in
parliament
to
the
fact
of
his
being
a
commoner
and
a
nobleman
at
the
same
time
and
to
certain
information
which
was
conveyed
to
her
surely
in
a
most
unnecessary
manner
that
if
glascock
were
to
die
before
his
father
her
niece
would
never
become
lady
peterborough
although
her
niece
son
if
she
had
one
would
be
the
future
lord
no
doubt
she
blundered
as
was
most
natural
and
then
the
british
minister
wife
made
the
most
of
the
blunders
and
when
once
spalding
ventured
to
speak
of
caroline
as
her
ladyship
not
to
the
british
minister
wife
but
to
the
sister
of
one
of
the
secretaries
a
story
was
made
out
of
it
which
was
almost
as
false
as
it
was
poor
caroline
was
spoken
of
as
her
ladyship
backward
and
forwards
among
the
ladies
of
the
legation
in
a
manner
which
might
have
vexed
her
had
she
known
anything
about
it
but
nevertheless
all
the
ladies
prepared
their
best
flounces
to
go
to
the
wedding
the
time
would
soon
come
when
she
would
in
truth
be
a
ladyship
and
she
might
be
of
social
use
to
any
one
of
the
ladies
in
question
but
spalding
was
for
the
time
the
most
disturbed
of
any
of
the
party
concerned
he
was
a
tall
thin
clever
republican
of
the
north
very
fond
of
hearing
himself
talk
and
somewhat
apt
to
take
advantage
of
the
courtesies
of
conversation
for
the
purpose
of
making
unpardonable
speeches
as
long
as
there
was
any
give
and
take
going
on
in
the
mêlée
of
words
he
would
speak
quickly
and
with
energy
seizing
his
chances
among
others
but
the
moment
he
had
established
his
right
to
the
floor
as
soon
as
he
had
won
for
himself
the
position
of
having
his
turn
at
the
argument
he
would
dole
out
his
words
with
considerable
slowness
raise
his
hand
for
oratorial
effect
and
proceed
as
though
time
were
annihilated
and
he
would
go
further
even
than
this
for
fearing
by
experience
the
escape
of
his
victims
he
would
catch
a
man
by
the
of
his
coat
or
back
him
ruthlessly
into
the
corner
of
a
room
and
then
lay
on
to
him
without
quarter
since
the
affair
with
glascock
had
been
settled
he
had
talked
an
immensity
about
england
not
absolutely
taking
honour
to
himself
because
of
his
intended
connection
with
a
lord
but
making
so
many
references
to
the
aristocratic
side
of
the
british
constitution
as
to
leave
no
doubt
on
the
minds
of
his
hearers
as
to
the
source
of
his
arguments
in
old
days
before
all
this
was
happening
spalding
though
a
courteous
man
in
his
personal
relations
had
constantly
spoken
of
england
with
the
bitter
indignation
of
the
ordinary
american
politician
england
must
be
made
to
disgorge
england
must
be
made
to
do
justice
england
must
be
taught
her
place
in
the
world
england
must
give
up
her
claims
in
hot
moments
he
had
gone
further
and
had
declared
that
england
must
be
whipped
he
had
been
specially
loud
against
that
aristocracy
of
england
which
according
to
a
figure
of
speech
often
used
by
him
was
always
feeding
on
the
vitals
of
the
people
but
now
all
this
was
very
much
changed
he
did
not
go
the
length
of
expressing
an
opinion
that
the
house
of
lords
was
a
valuable
institution
but
he
discussed
questions
of
primogeniture
and
hereditary
legislation
in
reference
to
their
fitness
for
countries
which
were
gradually
emerging
from
feudal
systems
with
an
equanimity
an
impartiality
and
a
perseverance
which
soon
convinced
those
who
listened
to
him
where
he
had
learned
his
present
lessons
and
why
the
conservative
nature
of
your
institutions
sir
he
said
to
poor
sir
marmaduke
at
the
baths
of
lucca
a
very
few
days
before
the
marriage
has
to
be
studied
with
great
care
before
its
effects
can
be
appreciated
in
reference
to
a
people
who
perhaps
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
have
more
in
their
composition
of
constitutional
reverence
than
of
educated
intelligence
sir
marmaduke
having
suffered
before
had
endeavoured
to
bolt
but
the
american
had
caught
him
and
pinned
him
and
the
governor
of
the
mandarins
was
impotent
in
his
hands
the
position
of
the
great
peer
of
parliament
is
doubtless
very
splendid
and
may
be
very
useful
continued
spalding
who
was
intending
to
bring
round
his
argument
to
the
evil
doings
of
certain
scandalously
extravagant
young
lords
and
to
offer
a
suggestion
that
in
such
cases
a
committee
of
aged
and
respected
peers
should
sit
and
decide
whether
a
second
son
or
some
other
heir
should
not
be
called
to
the
inheritance
both
of
the
title
and
the
property
but
spalding
had
seen
the
sufferings
of
sir
marmaduke
and
had
rescued
him
spalding
she
had
said
it
is
too
late
for
politics
and
sir
marmaduke
has
come
out
here
for
a
holiday
then
she
took
her
husband
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
helpless
in
spite
of
these
drawbacks
to
the
success
if
ought
can
be
said
to
be
a
drawback
on
success
of
which
the
successful
one
is
unconscious
the
marriage
was
prepared
with
great
splendour
and
everybody
who
was
anybody
in
florence
was
to
be
present
there
were
only
to
be
four
bridesmaids
caroline
herself
having
strongly
objected
to
a
greater
number
as
wallachia
petrie
had
fled
at
the
first
note
of
preparation
for
these
trivial
and
unpalatable
festivities
another
american
young
lady
was
found
and
the
sister
of
the
english
secretary
of
legation
who
had
so
maliciously
spread
that
report
about
her
ladyship
gladly
agreed
to
be
the
fourth
as
the
reader
will
remember
the
whole
party
from
the
baths
of
lucca
reached
florence
only
the
day
before
the
marriage
and
nora
at
the
station
promised
to
go
up
to
caroline
that
same
evening
glascock
will
tell
me
about
the
little
boy
said
caroline
but
i
shall
be
so
anxious
to
hear
about
your
sister
so
nora
crossed
the
bridge
after
dinner
and
went
up
to
the
american
minister
palatial
residence
caroline
was
then
in
the
loggia
and
glascock
was
with
her
and
for
a
while
they
talked
about
emily
trevelyan
and
her
misfortunes
glascock
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
trevelyan
would
soon
be
either
in
an
asylum
or
in
his
grave
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
tell
your
sister
so
he
said
but
i
think
your
father
should
be
told
or
your
mother
something
should
be
done
to
put
an
end
to
that
fearful
residence
at
casalunga
then
by
degrees
the
conversation
changed
itself
to
nora
prospects
and
caroline
with
her
friend
hand
in
hers
asked
after
hugh
stanbury
you
will
not
mind
speaking
before
him
will
you
said
caroline
putting
her
hand
on
her
own
lover
arm
not
unless
he
should
mind
it
said
nora
smiling
she
had
meant
nothing
beyond
a
simple
reply
to
her
friend
question
but
he
took
her
words
in
a
different
sense
and
blushed
as
he
remembered
his
visit
to
nuncombe
putney
he
thinks
almost
more
of
your
happiness
than
he
does
of
mine
said
caroline
which
is
fair
as
i
am
sure
that
stanbury
will
not
reciprocate
the
attention
and
now
dear
when
are
we
to
see
you
who
on
earth
can
say
i
suppose
stanbury
would
say
something
only
he
is
not
here
and
papa
wo
send
my
letter
said
nora
you
are
sure
that
you
will
not
go
out
to
the
islands
with
him
quite
sure
said
nora
i
have
made
up
my
mind
so
far
as
that
and
what
will
your
sister
do
i
think
she
will
stay
i
think
she
will
say
to
papa
and
mamma
here
in
florence
i
am
quite
of
opinion
that
she
should
not
leave
her
husband
alone
in
italy
said
glascock
she
has
not
told
us
with
certainty
said
nora
but
i
feel
sure
that
she
will
stay
papa
thinks
she
ought
to
go
with
them
to
london
your
papa
seems
to
have
two
very
intractable
daughters
said
caroline
as
for
me
declared
nora
solemnly
nothing
shall
make
me
go
back
to
the
islands
unless
stanbury
should
tell
me
to
do
so
and
they
start
at
the
end
of
july
on
the
last
saturday
and
what
will
you
do
then
nora
i
believe
there
are
casual
wards
that
people
go
to
casual
wards
said
caroline
miss
rowley
is
condescending
to
poke
her
fun
at
you
said
glascock
she
is
quite
welcome
and
shall
poke
as
much
as
she
likes
only
we
must
be
serious
now
if
it
be
necessary
we
will
get
back
by
the
end
of
july
wo
we
charles
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
nora
what
give
up
your
honeymoon
to
provide
me
with
board
and
lodgings
how
can
you
suppose
that
i
am
so
selfish
or
so
helpless
i
would
go
to
my
aunt
mrs
outhouse
we
know
that
that
would
do
said
caroline
you
might
as
well
be
in
italy
as
far
as
stanbury
is
concerned
if
miss
rowley
would
go
to
monkhams
she
might
wait
for
us
suggested
glascock
old
richards
is
there
and
though
of
course
she
would
be
dull
it
is
quite
unnecessary
said
nora
i
shall
take
a
back
in
a
respectable
feminine
quarter
like
any
other
young
woman
who
wants
such
accommodation
and
shall
wait
there
till
my
young
man
can
come
and
give
me
his
arm
to
church
that
is
about
the
way
we
shall
do
it
i
am
not
going
to
give
myself
any
airs
glascock
or
make
any
difficulties
papa
is
always
talking
to
me
about
chairs
and
tables
and
and
i
shall
practise
to
do
with
as
few
of
them
as
possible
as
i
am
headstrong
about
having
my
young
man
and
i
own
that
i
am
headstrong
about
that
i
guess
i
got
to
fit
myself
for
that
sort
of
life
and
nora
as
she
said
this
pronounced
her
words
with
something
of
a
nasal
twang
imitating
certain
countrywomen
of
her
friend
i
like
to
hear
you
joking
about
it
nora
because
your
voice
is
so
cheery
and
you
are
so
bright
when
you
joke
but
nevertheless
one
has
to
be
reasonable
and
to
look
the
facts
in
the
face
i
do
see
how
you
are
to
be
left
in
london
alone
and
you
know
that
your
aunt
outhouse
or
at
any
rate
your
uncle
would
not
receive
you
except
on
receiving
some
strong
pledge
i
certainly
shall
not
give
an
pledge
and
therefore
that
is
out
of
the
question
you
will
have
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
in
london
in
all
the
bustle
of
their
departure
and
i
declare
i
think
that
at
the
last
moment
you
will
go
with
them
never
unless
he
says
so
i
do
see
how
you
are
even
to
meet
and
talk
it
over
i
manage
that
my
promise
not
to
write
lasts
only
while
we
are
in
italy
i
think
we
had
better
get
back
to
england
charles
and
take
pity
on
this
poor
destitute
one
if
you
talk
of
such
a
thing
i
will
swear
that
i
will
never
go
to
monkhams
you
will
find
that
i
shall
manage
it
it
may
be
that
i
shall
do
something
very
shocking
so
that
all
your
patronage
will
hardly
be
able
to
bring
me
round
afterwards
but
i
will
do
something
that
will
serve
my
purpose
i
have
not
gone
so
far
as
this
to
be
turned
back
now
nora
as
she
spoke
of
having
gone
so
far
was
looking
at
glascock
who
was
seated
in
an
easy
close
to
the
girl
whom
he
was
to
make
his
wife
on
the
morrow
and
she
was
thinking
no
doubt
of
the
visit
which
he
had
made
to
nuncombe
putney
and
of
the
first
irretrievable
step
which
she
had
taken
when
she
told
him
that
her
love
was
given
to
another
that
had
been
her
rubicon
and
though
there
had
been
periods
with
her
since
the
passing
of
it
in
which
she
had
felt
that
she
had
crossed
it
in
vain
that
she
had
thrown
away
the
splendid
security
of
the
other
bank
without
obtaining
the
perilous
object
of
her
ambition
though
there
had
been
moments
in
which
she
had
almost
regretted
her
own
courage
and
noble
action
still
having
passed
the
river
there
was
nothing
for
her
but
to
go
on
to
rome
she
was
not
going
to
be
stopped
now
by
the
want
of
a
house
in
which
to
hide
herself
for
a
few
weeks
she
was
without
money
except
so
much
as
her
mother
might
be
able
almost
surreptitiously
to
give
her
she
was
without
friends
to
help
her
except
these
who
were
now
with
her
whose
friendship
had
come
to
her
in
so
singular
a
manner
and
whose
power
to
aid
her
at
the
present
moment
was
cruelly
curtailed
by
their
own
circumstances
nothing
was
settled
as
to
her
own
marriage
in
consequence
of
the
promise
that
had
been
extorted
from
her
that
she
should
not
correspond
with
stanbury
she
knew
nothing
of
his
present
wishes
or
intention
her
father
was
so
offended
by
her
firmness
that
he
would
hardly
speak
to
her
and
it
was
evident
to
her
that
her
mother
though
disposed
to
yield
was
still
in
hopes
that
her
daughter
in
the
press
and
difficulty
of
the
moment
would
allow
herself
to
be
carried
away
with
the
rest
of
the
family
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
she
knew
all
this
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
be
carried
away
it
was
not
very
pleasant
the
thought
that
she
would
be
obliged
at
last
to
ask
her
young
man
as
she
called
him
to
provide
for
her
but
she
would
do
that
and
trust
herself
altogether
in
his
hands
sooner
than
be
taken
to
the
antipodes
i
can
be
very
resolute
if
i
please
my
dear
she
said
looking
at
caroline
glascock
almost
thought
that
she
must
have
intended
to
address
him
they
sat
there
discussing
the
matter
for
some
time
through
the
long
cool
evening
hours
but
nothing
could
be
settled
further
except
that
nora
would
write
to
her
friend
as
soon
as
her
affairs
had
begun
to
shape
themselves
after
her
return
to
england
at
last
caroline
went
into
the
house
and
for
a
few
minutes
glascock
was
alone
with
nora
he
had
remained
determining
that
the
moment
should
come
but
now
that
it
was
there
he
was
for
awhile
unable
to
say
the
words
that
he
wished
to
utter
at
last
he
spoke
miss
rowley
caroline
is
so
eager
to
be
your
friend
i
know
she
is
and
i
do
love
her
so
dearly
but
without
joke
glascock
there
will
be
as
it
were
a
great
gulf
between
us
i
do
not
know
that
there
need
be
any
gulf
great
or
little
but
i
did
not
mean
to
allude
to
that
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
my
feelings
are
not
a
bit
less
warm
or
sincere
than
hers
you
know
of
old
that
i
am
not
very
good
at
expressing
myself
i
know
nothing
of
the
kind
there
is
no
such
gulf
as
what
you
speak
of
all
that
is
mostly
gone
by
and
a
nobleman
in
england
though
he
has
advantages
as
a
gentleman
is
no
more
than
a
gentleman
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
i
am
saying
now
i
shall
never
forget
my
journey
to
devonshire
i
wo
pretend
to
say
now
that
i
regret
its
result
i
am
quite
sure
you
do
no
i
do
not
though
i
thought
then
that
i
should
regret
it
always
but
remember
this
miss
rowley
that
you
can
never
ask
me
to
do
anything
that
i
will
not
if
possible
do
for
you
you
are
in
some
little
difficulty
now
it
will
disappear
glascock
difficulties
always
do
but
we
will
do
anything
that
we
are
wanted
to
do
and
should
a
certain
event
take
place
it
will
take
place
some
day
then
i
hope
that
we
may
be
able
to
make
stanbury
and
his
wife
quite
at
home
at
monkhams
after
that
he
took
nora
hand
and
kissed
it
and
at
that
moment
caroline
came
back
to
them
glascock
she
said
you
will
i
believe
be
at
liberty
to
kiss
everybody
but
you
should
be
more
discreet
it
was
generally
admitted
among
the
various
legations
in
florence
that
there
had
not
been
such
a
wedding
in
the
city
of
flowers
since
it
had
become
the
capital
of
italia
glascock
and
miss
spalding
were
married
in
the
chapel
of
the
legation
a
legation
chapel
on
the
ground
floor
having
been
extemporised
for
the
occasion
this
greatly
enhanced
the
pleasantness
of
the
thing
and
saved
the
necessity
of
matrons
and
bridesmaids
packing
themselves
and
their
finery
into
close
fusty
carriages
a
portion
of
the
guests
attended
in
the
chapel
and
the
remainder
when
the
ceremony
was
over
were
found
strolling
about
the
shady
garden
the
whole
affair
of
the
breakfast
was
very
splendid
and
lasted
some
hours
in
the
midst
of
this
the
bride
and
bridegroom
were
whisked
away
with
a
pair
of
grey
horses
to
the
railway
station
and
before
the
last
toast
of
the
day
had
been
proposed
by
the
belgian
councillor
of
legation
they
were
half
way
up
the
apennines
on
their
road
to
bologna
spalding
behaved
himself
like
a
man
on
the
occasion
nothing
was
spared
in
the
way
of
expense
and
when
he
made
that
celebrated
speech
in
which
he
declared
that
the
republican
virtue
of
the
new
world
had
linked
itself
in
a
happy
alliance
with
the
aristocratic
splendour
of
the
old
and
went
on
with
a
simile
about
the
lion
and
the
lamb
everybody
accepted
it
with
good
humour
in
spite
of
its
being
a
little
too
long
for
the
occasion
it
has
gone
off
very
well
mamma
has
it
not
said
nora
as
she
returned
home
with
her
mother
to
her
lodgings
yes
my
dear
much
i
fancy
as
these
things
generally
do
i
thought
it
was
so
nice
and
she
looked
so
very
well
and
he
was
so
pleasant
and
so
much
like
a
gentleman
not
noisy
you
know
and
yet
not
too
serious
i
dare
say
my
love
it
is
easy
enough
mamma
for
a
girl
to
be
married
for
she
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
wear
her
clothes
and
look
as
pretty
as
she
can
and
if
she
cries
and
has
a
red
nose
it
is
forgiven
her
but
a
man
has
so
difficult
a
part
to
play
if
he
tries
to
carry
himself
as
though
it
were
not
a
special
occasion
he
looks
like
a
fool
that
way
and
if
he
is
very
special
he
looks
like
a
fool
the
other
way
i
thought
glascock
did
it
very
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
i
did
not
observe
him
i
did
narrowly
he
had
tied
his
cravat
at
all
nicely
how
you
could
think
of
his
cravat
nora
with
such
memories
as
you
must
have
and
such
regrets
i
can
not
understand
mamma
my
memories
of
glascock
are
pleasant
memories
and
as
for
regrets
i
have
not
one
can
i
regret
mamma
that
i
did
not
marry
a
man
whom
i
did
not
love
and
that
i
rejected
him
when
i
knew
that
i
loved
another
you
can
not
mean
that
mamma
i
know
this
that
i
was
thinking
all
the
time
how
proud
i
should
have
been
and
how
much
more
fortunate
he
would
have
been
had
you
been
standing
there
instead
of
that
american
young
woman
as
she
said
this
lady
rowley
burst
into
tears
and
nora
could
only
answer
her
mother
by
embracing
her
they
were
alone
together
their
party
having
been
too
large
for
one
carriage
and
sir
marmaduke
having
taken
his
two
younger
daughters
of
course
i
feel
it
said
lady
rowley
through
her
tears
it
would
have
been
such
a
position
for
my
child
and
that
young
man
without
a
shilling
in
the
world
and
writing
in
that
way
just
for
bare
bread
nora
had
nothing
more
to
say
a
feeling
that
in
herself
would
have
been
base
was
simply
affectionate
and
maternal
in
her
mother
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
make
her
mother
see
it
as
she
saw
it
there
was
but
one
intervening
day
and
then
the
rowleys
returned
to
england
there
had
been
as
it
were
a
tacit
agreement
among
them
that
in
spite
of
all
their
troubles
their
holiday
should
be
a
holiday
up
to
the
time
of
the
glascock
marriage
then
must
commence
at
once
the
stern
necessity
of
their
return
home
home
not
only
to
england
but
to
those
antipodean
islands
from
which
it
was
too
probable
that
some
of
them
might
never
come
back
and
the
difficulties
in
their
way
seemed
to
be
almost
insuperable
first
of
all
there
was
to
be
the
parting
from
emily
trevelyan
she
had
determined
to
remain
in
florence
and
had
written
to
her
husband
saying
that
she
would
do
so
and
declaring
her
willingness
to
go
out
to
him
or
to
receive
him
in
florence
at
any
time
and
in
any
manner
that
he
might
appoint
she
had
taken
this
as
a
first
step
intending
to
go
to
casalunga
very
shortly
even
though
she
should
receive
no
answer
from
him
the
parting
between
her
and
her
mother
and
father
and
sisters
was
very
bitter
sir
marmaduke
as
he
had
become
estranged
from
nora
had
grown
to
be
more
and
more
gentle
and
loving
with
his
elder
daughter
and
was
nearly
overcome
at
the
idea
of
leaving
her
in
a
strange
land
with
a
husband
near
her
mad
and
yet
not
within
her
custody
but
he
could
do
nothing
could
hardly
say
a
word
toward
opposing
her
though
her
husband
was
mad
he
supplied
her
with
the
means
of
living
and
when
she
said
that
it
was
her
duty
to
be
near
him
her
father
could
not
deny
it
the
parting
came
i
will
return
to
you
the
moment
you
send
to
me
were
nora
last
words
to
her
sister
i
do
suppose
i
shall
send
said
emily
i
shall
try
to
bear
it
without
assistance
then
the
journey
from
italy
to
england
was
made
without
much
gratification
or
excitement
and
the
rowley
family
again
found
themselves
at

chapter
lxxxviii
cropper
and
burgess
we
must
now
go
back
to
exeter
and
look
after
brooke
burgess
and
miss
dorothy
stanbury
it
is
rather
hard
upon
readers
that
they
should
be
thus
hurried
from
the
completion
of
hymeneals
at
florence
to
the
preparations
for
other
hymeneals
in
devonshire
but
it
is
the
nature
of
a
complex
story
to
be
entangled
with
many
weddings
towards
its
close
in
this
little
history
there
are
we
fear
three
or
four
more
to
come
we
will
not
anticipate
by
alluding
prematurely
to
hugh
stanbury
treachery
or
death
or
the
possibility
that
he
after
all
may
turn
out
to
be
the
real
descendant
of
the
true
lord
peterborough
and
the
actual
inheritor
of
the
title
and
estate
of
monkhams
nor
will
we
speak
of
nora
certain
fortitude
under
either
of
these
emergencies
but
the
instructed
reader
must
be
aware
that
camilla
french
ought
to
have
a
husband
found
for
her
that
colonel
osborne
should
be
caught
in
some
matrimonial
trap
as
how
otherwise
should
he
be
fitly
punished
and
that
something
should
be
at
least
attempted
for
priscilla
stanbury
who
from
the
first
has
been
intended
to
be
the
real
heroine
of
these
pages
that
martha
should
marry
giles
hickbody
and
barty
burgess
run
away
with
machugh
is
of
course
evident
to
the
meanest
capacity
but
the
fate
of
brooke
burgess
and
of
dorothy
will
require
to
be
evolved
with
some
delicacy
and
much
detail
there
was
considerable
difficulty
in
fixing
the
day
in
the
first
place
miss
stanbury
was
not
very
well
and
then
she
was
very
fidgety
she
must
see
brooke
again
before
the
day
was
fixed
and
after
seeing
brooke
she
must
see
her
lawyer
to
have
a
lot
of
money
to
look
after
is
more
plague
than
profit
my
dear
she
said
to
dorothy
one
day
particularly
when
you
do
quite
know
what
you
ought
to
do
with
it
dorothy
had
always
avoided
any
conversation
with
her
aunt
about
money
since
the
first
moment
in
which
she
had
thought
of
accepting
brooke
burgess
as
her
husband
she
knew
that
her
aunt
had
some
feeling
which
made
her
averse
to
the
idea
that
any
portion
of
the
property
which
she
had
inherited
should
be
enjoyed
by
a
stanbury
after
her
death
and
dorothy
guided
by
this
knowledge
had
almost
convinced
herself
that
her
love
for
brooke
was
treason
either
against
him
or
against
her
aunt
if
by
engaging
herself
to
him
she
should
rob
him
of
his
inheritance
how
bitter
a
burden
to
him
would
her
love
have
been
if
on
the
other
hand
she
should
reward
her
aunt
for
all
that
had
been
done
for
her
by
forcing
herself
a
stanbury
into
a
position
not
intended
for
her
how
base
would
be
her
ingratitude
these
thoughts
had
troubled
her
much
and
had
always
prevented
her
from
answering
any
of
her
aunt
chance
allusions
to
the
property
for
her
things
had
at
last
gone
very
right
she
did
not
quite
know
how
it
had
come
about
but
she
was
engaged
to
marry
the
man
she
loved
and
her
aunt
was
at
any
rate
reconciled
to
the
marriage
but
when
miss
stanbury
declared
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
about
the
property
dorothy
could
only
hold
her
tongue
she
had
had
plenty
to
say
when
it
had
been
suggested
to
her
that
the
marriage
should
be
put
off
yet
for
a
short
while
and
that
in
the
meantime
brooke
should
come
again
to
exeter
she
swore
that
she
did
not
care
for
how
long
it
was
put
off
only
that
she
hoped
it
might
not
be
put
off
altogether
and
as
for
brooke
coming
that
for
the
present
would
be
very
much
nicer
than
being
married
out
of
hand
at
once
dorothy
in
truth
was
not
at
all
in
a
hurry
to
be
married
but
she
would
have
liked
to
have
had
her
lover
always
coming
and
going
since
the
courtship
had
become
a
thing
permitted
she
had
had
the
privilege
of
welcoming
him
twice
at
the
house
in
the
close
and
that
running
down
to
meet
him
in
the
little
front
parlour
and
the
getting
up
to
make
his
breakfast
for
him
as
he
started
in
the
morning
were
among
the
happiest
epochs
of
her
life
and
then
as
soon
as
ever
the
breakfast
was
eaten
and
he
was
gone
she
would
sit
down
to
write
him
a
letter
oh
those
letters
so
beautifully
crossed
more
than
one
of
which
was
copied
from
beginning
to
end
because
some
word
in
it
was
not
thought
to
be
sweet
enough
what
a
heaven
of
happiness
they
were
to
her
the
writing
of
the
first
had
disturbed
her
greatly
and
she
had
almost
repented
of
the
privilege
before
it
was
ended
but
with
the
first
and
second
the
difficulties
had
disappeared
and
had
she
not
felt
somewhat
ashamed
of
the
occupation
she
could
have
sat
at
her
desk
and
written
him
letters
all
day
brooke
would
answer
them
with
fair
regularity
but
in
a
most
cursory
manner
sending
seven
or
eight
lines
in
return
for
two
sheets
fully
crossed
but
this
did
not
discompose
her
in
the
least
he
was
worked
hard
at
his
office
and
had
hundreds
of
other
things
to
do
he
too
could
say
so
thought
dorothy
more
in
eight
lines
than
she
could
put
into
as
many
pages
she
was
quite
happy
when
she
was
told
that
the
marriage
could
not
take
place
till
august
but
that
brooke
must
come
again
in
july
brooke
did
come
in
the
first
week
of
july
and
somewhat
horrified
dorothy
by
declaring
to
her
that
miss
stanbury
was
unreasonable
if
i
insist
upon
leaving
london
so
often
for
a
day
or
two
said
he
how
am
i
to
get
anything
like
leave
of
absence
when
the
time
comes
in
answer
to
this
dorothy
tried
to
make
him
understand
that
business
should
not
be
neglected
and
that
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
she
could
do
very
well
without
that
trip
abroad
which
he
had
proposed
for
her
i
not
going
to
be
done
in
that
way
said
brooke
and
now
that
i
am
here
she
has
nothing
to
say
to
me
i
told
her
a
dozen
times
that
i
do
want
to
know
anything
about
her
will
and
that
i
take
it
all
for
granted
there
is
something
to
be
settled
on
you
that
she
calls
her
own
she
is
so
generous
brooke
she
is
generous
enough
but
she
is
very
whimsical
she
is
going
to
make
her
whole
will
over
again
and
now
she
wants
to
send
some
message
to
uncle
barty
i
do
know
what
it
is
yet
but
i
am
to
take
it
as
far
as
i
can
understand
she
has
sent
all
the
way
to
london
for
me
in
order
that
i
may
take
a
message
across
the
close
you
talk
as
though
it
were
very
disagreeable
coming
to
exeter
said
dorothy
with
a
little
pout
so
it
is
very
disagreeable
oh
brooke
very
disagreeable
if
our
marriage
is
to
be
put
off
by
it
i
think
it
will
be
so
much
nicer
making
love
somewhere
on
the
rhine
than
having
snatches
of
it
here
and
talking
all
the
time
about
wills
and
tenements
and
settlements
as
he
said
this
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
his
face
quite
close
to
hers
shewing
thereby
that
he
was
not
altogether
averse
even
to
his
present
privileges
she
forgave
him
on
that
same
afternoon
just
before
the
banking
hours
were
over
brooke
went
across
to
the
house
of
cropper
and
burgess
having
first
been
closeted
for
nearly
an
hour
with
his
aunt
and
as
he
went
his
step
was
sedate
and
his
air
was
serious
he
found
his
uncle
barty
and
was
not
very
long
in
delivering
his
message
it
was
to
this
effect
that
miss
stanbury
particularly
wished
to
see
bartholomew
burgess
on
business
at
some
hour
on
that
afternoon
or
that
evening
brooke
himself
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
subject
in
regard
to
which
this
singular
interview
was
desired
but
it
was
not
a
part
of
his
duty
to
communicate
any
information
respecting
it
it
had
been
necessary
that
his
consent
to
certain
arrangements
should
be
asked
before
the
invitation
to
barty
burgess
could
be
given
but
his
present
mission
was
confined
to
an
authority
to
give
the
invitation
old
burgess
was
much
surprised
and
was
at
first
disposed
to
decline
the
proposition
made
by
the
old
harridan
as
he
called
her
he
had
never
put
any
restraint
on
his
language
in
talking
of
miss
stanbury
with
his
nephew
and
was
not
disposed
to
do
so
now
because
she
had
taken
a
new
vagary
into
her
head
but
there
was
something
in
his
nephew
manner
which
at
last
induced
him
to
discuss
the
matter
rationally
and
you
do
know
what
it
all
about
said
uncle
barty
i
ca
quite
say
that
i
suppose
i
do
know
pretty
well
at
any
rate
i
know
enough
to
think
that
you
ought
to
come
but
i
must
not
say
what
it
is
will
it
do
me
or
anybody
else
any
good
it
ca
do
you
any
harm
she
wo
eat
you
but
she
can
abuse
me
like
a
pickpocket
and
i
should
return
it
and
then
there
would
be
a
scolding
match
i
always
have
kept
out
of
her
way
and
i
think
i
had
better
do
so
still
nevertheless
brooke
prevailed
or
rather
the
feeling
of
curiosity
which
was
naturally
engendered
prevailed
for
very
very
many
years
barty
burgess
had
never
entered
or
left
his
own
house
of
business
without
seeing
the
door
of
that
in
which
miss
stanbury
lived
and
he
had
never
seen
that
door
without
a
feeling
of
detestation
for
the
owner
of
it
it
would
perhaps
have
been
a
more
rational
feeling
on
his
part
had
he
confined
his
hatred
to
the
memory
of
his
brother
by
whose
will
miss
stanbury
had
been
enriched
and
he
had
been
as
he
thought
impoverished
but
there
had
been
a
contest
and
litigation
and
disputes
and
contradictions
and
a
long
course
of
those
incidents
in
life
which
lead
to
rancour
and
ill
blood
after
the
death
of
the
former
brooke
burgess
and
as
the
result
of
all
this
miss
stanbury
held
the
property
and
barty
burgess
held
his
hatred
he
had
never
been
ashamed
of
it
and
had
spoken
his
mind
out
to
all
who
would
hear
him
and
to
give
miss
stanbury
her
due
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
had
hardly
been
behind
him
in
the
warmth
of
her
expression
of
which
old
barty
was
well
aware
he
hated
and
knew
that
he
was
hated
in
return
and
he
knew
or
thought
that
he
knew
that
his
enemy
was
not
a
woman
to
relent
because
old
age
and
weakness
and
the
fear
of
death
were
coming
on
her
his
enemy
with
all
her
faults
was
no
coward
it
could
not
be
that
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
she
should
desire
to
reconcile
him
by
any
act
of
tardy
justice
nor
did
he
wish
to
be
reconciled
at
this
the
eleventh
hour
his
hatred
was
a
pleasant
excitement
to
him
his
abuse
of
miss
stanbury
was
a
chosen
recreation
his
unuttered
daily
curse
as
he
looked
over
to
her
door
was
a
relief
to
him
nevertheless
he
would
go
as
brooke
had
said
no
harm
could
come
of
his
going
he
would
go
and
at
least
listen
to
her
proposition
about
seven
in
the
evening
his
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
miss
stanbury
was
sitting
in
the
small
parlour
dressed
in
her
second
best
gown
and
was
prepared
with
considerable
stiffness
and
state
for
the
occasion
dorothy
was
with
her
but
was
desired
in
a
quick
voice
to
hurry
away
the
moment
the
knock
was
heard
as
though
old
barty
would
have
jumped
from
the
hall
door
into
the
room
at
a
bound
dorothy
collected
herself
with
a
little
start
and
went
without
a
word
she
had
heard
much
of
barty
burgess
but
had
never
spoken
to
him
and
was
subject
to
a
feeling
of
great
awe
when
she
would
remember
that
the
grim
old
man
of
whom
she
had
heard
so
much
evil
would
soon
be
her
uncle
according
to
arrangement
burgess
was
shewn
by
his
nephew
barty
burgess
had
been
born
in
this
very
house
but
had
not
been
inside
the
walls
of
it
for
more
than
thirty
years
he
also
was
somewhat
awed
by
the
occasion
and
followed
his
nephew
without
a
word
brooke
was
to
remain
at
hand
so
that
he
might
be
summoned
should
he
be
wanted
but
it
had
been
decided
by
miss
stanbury
that
he
should
not
be
present
at
the
interview
as
soon
as
her
visitor
entered
the
room
she
rose
in
a
stately
way
and
curtseyed
propping
herself
with
one
hand
upon
the
table
as
she
did
so
she
looked
him
full
in
the
face
meanwhile
and
curtseying
a
second
time
asked
him
to
seat
himself
in
a
chair
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
she
did
it
all
very
well
and
it
may
be
surmised
that
she
had
rehearsed
the
little
scene
perhaps
more
than
once
when
nobody
was
looking
at
her
he
bowed
and
walked
round
to
the
chair
and
seated
himself
but
finding
that
he
was
so
placed
that
he
could
not
see
his
neighbour
face
he
moved
his
chair
he
was
not
going
to
fight
such
a
duel
as
this
with
the
disadvantage
of
the
sun
in
his
eyes
illustration
barty
burgess
hitherto
there
had
hardly
been
a
word
spoken
miss
stanbury
had
muttered
something
as
she
was
curtseying
and
barty
burgess
had
made
some
return
then
she
began
burgess
she
said
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
your
complaisance
in
coming
here
at
my
request
to
this
he
bowed
again
i
should
not
have
ventured
thus
to
trouble
you
were
it
not
that
years
are
dealing
more
hardly
with
me
than
they
are
with
you
and
that
i
could
not
have
ventured
to
discuss
a
matter
of
deep
interest
otherwise
than
in
my
own
room
it
was
her
room
now
certainly
by
law
but
barty
burgess
remembered
it
when
it
was
his
mother
room
and
when
she
used
to
give
them
all
their
meals
there
now
so
many
many
years
ago
he
bowed
again
and
said
not
a
word
he
knew
well
that
she
could
sooner
be
brought
to
her
point
by
his
silence
than
by
his
speech
she
was
a
long
time
coming
to
her
point
before
she
could
do
so
she
was
forced
to
allude
to
times
long
past
and
to
subjects
which
she
found
it
very
difficult
to
touch
without
saying
that
which
would
either
belie
herself
or
seem
to
be
severe
upon
him
though
she
had
prepared
herself
she
could
hardly
get
the
words
spoken
and
she
was
greatly
impeded
by
the
obstinacy
of
his
silence
but
at
last
her
proposition
was
made
to
him
she
told
him
that
his
nephew
brooke
was
about
to
be
married
to
her
niece
dorothy
and
that
it
was
her
intention
to
make
brooke
her
heir
in
the
bulk
of
the
property
which
she
had
received
under
the
will
of
the
late
brooke
burgess
indeed
she
said
all
that
i
received
at
your
brother
hands
shall
go
back
to
your
brother
family
unimpaired
he
only
bowed
and
would
not
say
a
word
then
she
went
on
to
say
that
it
had
at
first
been
a
matter
to
her
of
deep
regret
that
brooke
should
have
set
his
affections
upon
her
niece
as
there
had
been
in
her
mind
a
strong
desire
that
none
of
her
own
people
should
enjoy
the
reversion
of
the
wealth
which
she
had
always
regarded
as
being
hers
only
for
the
term
of
her
life
but
that
she
had
found
that
the
young
people
had
been
so
much
in
earnest
and
that
her
own
feeling
had
been
so
near
akin
to
a
prejudice
that
she
had
yielded
when
this
was
said
barty
smiled
instead
of
bowing
and
miss
stanbury
felt
that
there
might
be
something
worse
even
than
his
silence
his
smile
told
her
that
he
believed
her
to
be
lying
nevertheless
she
went
on
she
was
not
fool
enough
to
suppose
that
the
whole
nature
of
the
man
was
to
be
changed
by
a
few
words
from
her
so
she
went
on
the
marriage
was
a
thing
fixed
and
she
was
thinking
of
settlements
and
had
been
talking
to
lawyers
about
a
new
will
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
help
you
said
barty
finding
that
a
longer
pause
than
usual
made
some
word
from
him
absolutely
necessary
i
am
going
on
to
that
and
i
regret
that
my
story
should
detain
you
so
long
mr
burgess
and
she
did
go
on
she
had
she
said
made
some
saving
out
of
her
income
she
was
not
going
to
trouble
burgess
with
this
matter
only
that
she
might
explain
to
him
that
what
she
would
at
once
give
to
the
young
couple
and
what
she
would
settle
on
dorothy
after
her
own
death
would
all
come
from
such
savings
and
that
such
gifts
and
bequests
would
not
diminish
the
family
property
barty
again
smiled
as
he
heard
this
and
miss
stanbury
in
her
heart
likened
him
to
the
devil
in
person
but
still
she
went
on
she
was
very
desirous
that
brooke
burgess
should
come
and
live
at
exeter
his
property
would
be
in
the
town
and
the
neighbourhood
it
would
be
a
seemly
thing
such
were
her
words
that
he
should
occupy
the
house
that
had
belonged
to
his
grandfather
and
his
and
then
moreover
she
acknowledged
that
she
spoke
selfishly
she
dreaded
the
idea
of
being
left
alone
for
the
remainder
of
her
own
years
her
proposition
at
last
was
uttered
it
was
simply
this
that
barty
burgess
should
give
to
his
nephew
brooke
his
share
in
the
bank
i
am
damned
if
i
do
said
barty
burgess
rising
up
from
his
chair
but
before
he
had
left
the
room
he
had
agreed
to
consider
the
proposition
miss
stanbury
had
of
course
known
that
any
such
suggestion
coming
from
her
without
an
adequate
reason
assigned
would
have
been
mere
idle
wind
she
was
prepared
with
such
adequate
reason
if
burgess
could
see
his
way
to
make
the
proposed
transfer
of
his
share
of
the
bank
business
she
miss
stanbury
would
hand
over
to
him
for
his
life
a
certain
proportion
of
the
burgess
property
which
lay
in
the
city
the
income
of
which
would
exceed
that
drawn
by
him
from
the
business
would
he
at
his
time
of
life
take
that
for
doing
nothing
which
he
now
got
for
working
hard
that
was
the
meaning
of
it
and
then
too
as
far
as
the
portion
of
the
property
went
and
it
extended
to
the
houses
owned
by
miss
stanbury
on
the
bank
side
of
the
close
it
would
belong
altogether
to
barty
burgess
for
his
life
it
will
simply
be
this
burgess
that
brooke
will
be
your
heir
as
would
be
natural
i
do
know
that
it
would
be
at
all
natural
said
he
i
should
prefer
to
choose
my
own
heir
no
doubt
burgess
in
respect
to
your
own
property
said
miss
stanbury
at
last
he
said
that
he
would
think
of
it
and
consult
his
partner
and
then
he
got
up
to
take
his
leave
for
myself
said
miss
stanbury
i
would
wish
that
all
animosities
might
be
buried
we
can
say
that
they
are
buried
said
the
grim
old
man
but
nobody
will
believe
us
what
matters
if
we
could
believe
it
ourselves
but
suppose
we
did
i
do
believe
that
much
good
can
come
from
talking
of
such
things
miss
stanbury
you
and
i
have
grown
too
old
to
swear
a
friendship
i
will
think
of
this
thing
and
if
i
find
that
it
can
be
made
to
suit
without
much
difficulty
i
will
perhaps
entertain
it
then
the
interview
was
over
and
old
barty
made
his
way
and
out
of
the
house
he
looked
over
to
the
tenements
in
the
close
which
were
offered
to
him
every
circumstance
of
each
one
of
which
he
knew
and
felt
that
he
might
do
worse
were
he
to
leave
the
bank
he
could
not
take
his
entire
income
with
him
and
it
had
been
long
said
of
him
that
he
ought
to
leave
it
the
croppers
who
were
his
partners
and
whom
he
had
never
loved
would
be
glad
to
welcome
in
his
place
one
of
the
old
family
who
would
have
money
and
then
the
name
would
be
perpetuated
in
exeter
which
even
to
barty
burgess
was
something
on
that
night
the
scheme
was
divulged
to
dorothy
and
she
was
in
ecstasies
london
had
always
sounded
bleak
and
distant
and
terrible
to
her
and
her
heart
had
misgiven
her
at
the
idea
of
leaving
her
aunt
if
only
this
thing
might
be
arranged
when
brooke
spoke
the
next
morning
of
returning
at
once
to
his
office
he
was
rebuked
by
both
the
ladies
what
was
the
ecclesiastical
commission
office
to
any
of
them
when
matters
of
such
importance
were
concerned
but
brooke
would
not
be
talked
out
of
his
prudence
he
was
very
willing
to
be
made
a
banker
at
exeter
and
to
go
to
school
again
and
learn
banking
business
but
he
would
not
throw
up
his
occupation
in
london
till
he
knew
that
there
was
another
ready
for
him
in
the
country
one
day
longer
he
spent
in
exeter
and
during
that
day
he
was
more
than
once
with
his
uncle
he
saw
also
the
cropper
and
was
considerably
chilled
by
the
manner
in
which
they
at
first
seemed
to
entertain
the
proposition
indeed
for
a
couple
of
hours
he
thought
that
the
scheme
must
be
abandoned
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
that
barty
life
would
probably
be
short
and
that
he
barty
had
but
a
small
part
of
the
business
at
his
disposal
but
gradually
a
way
to
terms
was
seen
not
quite
so
simple
as
that
which
miss
stanbury
had
suggested
and
brooke
when
he
left
exeter
did
believe
it
possible
that
he
after
all
might
become
the
family
representative
in
the
old
of
the
burgesses
and
how
long
will
it
take
aunt
stanbury
dorothy
asked
do
you
be
impatient
my
dear
i
am
not
the
least
impatient
but
of
course
i
want
to
tell
mamma
and
priscilla
it
will
be
so
nice
to
live
here
and
not
go
up
to
london
are
we
to
stay
here
in
this
very
house
have
you
not
found
out
yet
that
brooke
will
be
likely
to
have
an
opinion
of
his
own
on
such
things
but
would
you
wish
us
to
live
here
aunt
i
hardly
know
dear
i
am
a
foolish
old
woman
and
can
not
say
what
i
would
wish
i
can
not
bear
to
be
alone
of
course
we
will
stay
with
you
and
yet
i
should
be
jealous
if
i
were
not
mistress
of
my
own
house
of
course
you
will
be
mistress
i
believe
dolly
that
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
die
i
have
come
to
feel
that
i
can
do
more
good
by
going
out
of
the
world
than
by
remaining
in
it
dorothy
hardly
answered
this
in
words
but
sat
close
by
her
aunt
holding
the
old
woman
hand
and
caressing
it
and
administering
that
love
of
which
miss
stanbury
had
enjoyed
so
little
during
her
life
and
which
had
become
so
necessary
to
her
the
news
about
the
bank
arrangements
though
kept
of
course
as
a
great
secret
soon
became
common
in
exeter
it
was
known
to
be
a
good
thing
for
the
firm
in
general
that
barty
burgess
should
be
removed
from
his
share
of
the
management
he
was
unpopular
and
very
stubborn
and
he
and
a
certain
julius
cropper
who
was
the
leading
man
among
the
croppers
had
not
always
been
comfortable
together
it
was
at
first
hinted
that
old
miss
stanbury
had
been
softened
by
sudden
twinges
of
conscience
and
that
she
had
confessed
to
some
terrible
crime
in
the
way
of
forgery
perjury
or
perhaps
worse
and
had
relieved
herself
at
last
by
making
full
restitution
but
such
a
rumour
as
this
did
not
last
long
or
receive
wide
credence
when
it
was
hinted
to
such
old
friends
as
sir
peter
mancrudy
and
machugh
they
laughed
it
to
scorn
and
it
did
not
exist
even
in
the
vague
form
of
an
undivulged
mystery
for
above
three
days
then
it
was
asserted
that
old
barty
had
been
found
to
have
no
real
claim
to
any
share
in
the
bank
and
that
he
was
to
be
turned
out
at
miss
stanbury
instance
that
he
was
to
be
turned
out
and
that
brooke
had
been
acknowledged
to
be
the
owner
of
the
burgess
share
of
her
business
then
came
the
fact
that
old
barty
had
been
bought
out
and
that
the
future
husband
of
miss
stanbury
niece
was
to
be
the
junior
partner
a
general
feeling
prevailed
at
last
that
there
had
been
another
great
battle
between
miss
stanbury
and
old
barty
and
that
the
old
maid
had
prevailed
now
as
she
had
done
in
former
days
before
the
end
of
july
the
papers
were
in
the
lawyer
hands
and
all
the
terms
had
been
fixed
brooke
came
down
again
and
again
to
dorothy
great
delight
and
displayed
considerable
firmness
in
the
management
of
his
own
interest
if
fate
intended
to
make
him
a
banker
in
exeter
instead
of
a
clerk
in
the
ecclesiastical
commission
office
he
would
be
a
banker
after
a
respectable
fashion
there
was
more
than
one
little
struggle
between
him
and
julius
cropper
which
ended
in
accession
of
respect
on
the
part
of
cropper
for
his
new
partner
cropper
had
thought
that
the
establishment
might
best
be
known
to
the
commercial
world
of
the
west
of
england
as
bank
but
brooke
had
been
very
firm
in
asserting
that
if
he
was
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
the
old
name
should
be
maintained
it
to
be
and
burgess
he
said
to
dorothy
one
afternoon
they
fought
hard
for
cropper
and
burgess
but
i
would
stand
more
than
one
cropper
of
course
not
said
dorothy
with
something
almost
of
scorn
in
her
voice
by
this
time
dorothy
had
gone
very
deeply
into
banking
business
chapter
lxxxix
i
would
do
it
if
i
was
you
miss
stanbury
at
this
time
was
known
all
through
exeter
to
be
very
much
altered
from
the
miss
stanbury
of
old
or
even
from
the
miss
stanbury
of
two
years
since
the
miss
stanbury
of
old
was
a
stalwart
lady
who
would
play
her
rubber
of
whist
five
nights
a
week
and
could
hold
her
own
in
conversation
against
the
best
woman
in
exeter
not
to
speak
of
her
acknowledged
superiority
over
every
man
in
that
city
now
she
cared
little
for
the
glories
of
debate
and
though
she
still
liked
her
rubber
and
could
wake
herself
up
to
the
old
fire
in
the
detection
of
a
revoke
or
the
claim
for
a
second
trick
her
rubbers
were
few
and
far
between
and
she
would
leave
her
own
house
on
an
evening
only
when
all
circumstances
were
favourable
and
with
many
precautions
against
wind
and
water
some
said
that
she
was
becoming
old
and
that
she
was
going
out
like
the
snuff
of
a
candle
but
sir
peter
mancrudy
declared
that
she
might
live
for
the
next
fifteen
years
if
she
would
only
think
so
herself
it
was
true
sir
peter
said
that
in
the
winter
she
had
been
ill
and
that
there
had
been
danger
as
to
her
throat
during
the
east
winds
of
the
spring
but
those
dangers
had
passed
away
and
if
she
would
only
exert
herself
she
might
be
almost
as
good
a
woman
as
ever
she
had
been
sir
peter
was
not
a
man
of
many
words
or
given
to
talk
frequently
of
his
patients
but
it
was
clearly
sir
peter
opinion
that
miss
mind
was
ill
at
ease
she
had
become
discontented
with
life
and
therefore
it
was
that
she
cared
no
longer
for
the
combat
of
tongues
and
had
become
cold
even
towards
the
it
was
so
in
truth
and
yet
perhaps
the
lives
of
few
men
or
women
had
been
more
innocent
and
few
had
struggled
harder
to
be
just
in
their
dealings
and
generous
in
their
thoughts
there
was
ever
present
to
her
mind
an
idea
of
failure
and
a
fear
lest
she
had
been
mistaken
in
her
views
throughout
her
life
no
one
had
ever
been
more
devoted
to
peculiar
opinions
or
more
strong
in
the
use
of
language
for
their
expression
and
she
was
so
far
true
to
herself
that
she
would
never
seem
to
retreat
from
the
position
she
had
taken
she
would
still
scorn
the
new
fangles
of
the
world
around
her
and
speak
of
the
changes
which
she
saw
as
all
tending
to
evil
but
through
it
all
there
was
an
idea
present
to
herself
that
it
could
not
be
god
intention
that
things
should
really
change
for
the
worse
and
that
the
fault
must
be
in
her
because
she
had
been
unable
to
move
as
others
had
moved
she
would
sit
thinking
of
the
circumstances
of
her
own
life
and
tell
herself
that
with
her
everything
had
failed
she
had
loved
but
had
quarrelled
with
her
lover
and
her
love
had
come
to
nothing
but
barren
wealth
she
had
fought
for
her
wealth
and
had
conquered
and
had
become
hard
in
the
fight
and
was
conscious
of
her
own
hardness
in
the
early
days
of
her
riches
and
power
she
had
taken
her
nephew
by
the
hand
and
had
thrown
him
away
from
her
because
he
would
not
dress
himself
in
her
mirror
she
had
believed
herself
to
be
right
and
would
not
even
now
tell
herself
that
she
had
been
wrong
but
there
were
doubts
and
qualms
of
conscience
and
an
uneasiness
because
her
life
had
been
a
failure
now
she
was
seeking
to
appease
her
by
sacrificing
everything
for
the
happiness
of
her
niece
and
her
chosen
hero
but
as
she
went
on
with
the
work
she
felt
that
all
would
be
in
vain
unless
she
could
sweep
herself
altogether
from
off
the
scene
she
had
told
herself
that
if
she
could
bring
brooke
to
exeter
his
prospects
would
be
made
infinitely
brighter
than
they
would
be
in
london
and
that
she
in
her
last
days
would
not
be
left
utterly
alone
but
as
the
prospect
of
her
future
life
came
nearer
to
her
she
saw
or
thought
that
she
saw
that
there
was
still
failure
before
her
young
people
would
not
want
an
old
woman
in
the
house
with
them
even
though
the
old
woman
would
declare
that
she
would
be
no
more
in
the
house
than
a
tame
cat
and
she
knew
herself
also
too
well
to
believe
that
she
could
make
herself
a
tame
cat
in
the
home
that
had
so
long
been
subject
to
her
dominion
would
it
not
be
better
that
she
should
go
away
somewhere
and
die
if
brooke
is
to
come
here
martha
said
to
her
one
day
we
ought
to
begin
and
make
the
changes
what
changes
you
are
always
wanting
to
make
changes
if
they
was
never
made
till
i
wanted
them
they
never
be
made
but
if
there
is
to
be
a
married
couple
there
should
be
things
proper
anyways
we
ought
to
know
ought
we
the
truth
of
this
statement
was
so
evident
that
miss
stanbury
could
not
contradict
it
but
she
had
not
even
yet
made
up
her
mind
ideas
were
running
through
her
head
which
she
knew
to
be
very
wild
but
of
which
she
could
not
divest
herself
martha
she
said
after
a
while
i
think
i
shall
go
away
from
this
myself
leave
the
house
said
martha
awestruck
there
are
other
houses
in
the
world
i
suppose
in
which
an
old
woman
can
live
and
die
there
is
houses
of
course
and
what
is
the
difference
between
one
and
another
i
would
do
it
if
i
was
you
i
would
do
it
if
it
was
ever
so
sure
the
house
is
big
enough
for
brooke
and
miss
dorothy
along
with
you
i
would
go
and
make
such
change
as
that
i
would
indeed
martha
spoke
out
almost
with
eloquence
so
much
expression
was
there
in
her
face
miss
stanbury
said
nothing
more
at
the
moment
beyond
signifying
her
indisposition
to
make
up
her
mind
to
anything
at
the
present
moment
yes
the
house
was
big
enough
as
far
as
rooms
were
concerned
but
how
often
had
she
heard
that
an
old
woman
must
always
be
in
the
way
if
attempting
to
live
with
a
couple
if
a
be
unendurable
how
much
more
so
one
whose
connection
would
be
less
near
she
could
keep
her
own
house
no
doubt
and
let
them
go
elsewhere
but
what
then
would
come
of
her
old
dream
that
burgess
the
new
banker
in
the
city
should
live
in
the
very
house
that
had
been
inhabited
by
the
burgesses
the
bankers
of
old
there
was
certainly
only
one
way
out
of
all
these
troubles
and
that
way
would
be
that
she
should
go
from
them
and
be
at
rest
her
will
had
now
been
drawn
out
and
completed
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
and
she
had
made
no
secret
of
its
contents
either
with
brooke
or
dorothy
the
whole
estate
she
left
to
brooke
including
the
houses
which
were
to
become
his
after
his
uncle
death
and
in
regard
to
the
property
she
had
made
no
further
stipulation
i
might
have
settled
it
on
your
children
she
said
to
him
but
in
doing
so
i
should
have
settled
it
on
hers
i
do
know
why
an
old
woman
should
try
to
interfere
with
things
after
she
has
gone
i
hope
you
squander
it
brooke
i
shall
be
a
steady
old
man
by
that
time
he
said
i
hope
you
be
steady
at
any
rate
but
there
it
is
and
god
must
direct
you
in
the
use
of
it
if
he
will
it
has
been
a
burthen
to
me
but
then
i
have
been
a
solitary
old
woman
half
of
what
she
had
saved
she
proposed
to
give
dorothy
on
her
marriage
and
for
doing
this
arrangements
had
already
been
made
there
were
various
other
legacies
and
the
last
she
announced
was
one
to
her
nephew
hugh
i
have
left
him
a
thousand
pounds
she
said
to
dorothy
so
that
he
may
remember
me
kindly
at
last
as
to
this
however
she
exacted
a
pledge
that
no
intimation
of
the
legacy
was
to
be
made
to
hugh
then
it
was
that
dorothy
told
her
aunt
that
hugh
intended
to
marry
nora
rowley
one
of
the
ladies
who
had
been
at
the
clock
house
during
the
days
in
which
her
mother
had
lived
in
grandeur
and
then
it
was
also
that
dorothy
obtained
leave
to
invite
hugh
to
her
own
wedding
i
hope
she
will
be
happier
than
her
sister
miss
stanbury
said
when
she
heard
of
the
intended
marriage
it
was
trevelyan
fault
you
know
aunt
i
say
nothing
about
anybody
fault
but
this
i
do
say
that
it
was
a
very
great
misfortune
i
fought
all
that
battle
with
your
sister
priscilla
and
i
do
mean
to
fight
it
again
my
dear
if
hugh
marries
the
young
lady
i
hope
she
will
be
more
happy
than
her
sister
there
can
be
no
harm
in
saying
that
dorothy
letter
to
her
brother
shall
be
given
because
it
will
inform
the
reader
of
all
the
arrangements
as
they
were
made
up
to
that
time
and
will
convey
the
exeter
news
respecting
various
persons
with
whom
our
story
is
concerned
the
close
july
dear
hugh
the
day
for
my
marriage
is
now
fixed
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
it
was
the
same
with
you
pray
give
my
love
to
nora
it
seems
so
odd
that
though
she
was
living
for
a
while
with
mamma
at
nuncombe
putney
i
never
should
have
seen
her
yet
i
am
very
glad
that
brooke
has
seen
her
and
he
declares
that
she
is
quite
those
are
his
own
words
we
are
to
be
married
on
the
of
august
a
wednesday
and
now
comes
my
great
news
aunt
stanbury
says
that
you
are
to
come
and
stay
in
the
house
she
bids
me
tell
you
so
with
her
love
and
that
you
can
have
a
room
as
long
as
you
like
course
you
must
in
the
first
place
you
must
because
you
are
to
give
me
away
and
brooke
have
me
if
i
was
given
away
properly
and
then
it
will
make
me
so
happy
that
you
and
aunt
stanbury
should
be
friends
again
you
can
stay
as
long
as
you
like
but
of
course
you
must
come
the
day
before
the
wedding
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
cathedral
and
there
are
to
be
two
clergymen
but
i
do
yet
know
who
they
will
be
not
gibson
certainly
as
you
were
good
enough
to
suggest
gibson
is
married
to
arabella
french
and
they
have
gone
away
somewhere
into
cornwall
camilla
has
come
back
and
i
have
seen
her
once
she
looked
ever
so
fierce
as
though
she
intended
to
declare
that
she
did
mind
what
anybody
may
think
they
say
that
she
still
protests
that
she
never
will
speak
to
her
sister
again
i
was
introduced
to
barty
burgess
the
other
day
brooke
was
here
and
we
met
him
in
the
close
i
hardly
knew
what
he
said
to
me
i
was
so
frightened
but
brooke
said
that
he
meant
to
be
civil
and
that
he
is
going
to
send
me
a
present
i
have
got
a
quantity
of
things
already
and
yesterday
machugh
sent
me
such
a
beautiful
if
you
come
in
time
on
the
you
shall
see
them
all
before
they
are
put
away
mamma
and
priscilla
are
to
be
here
and
they
will
come
on
the
also
poor
dear
mamma
is
i
know
terribly
flurried
about
it
and
so
is
aunt
stanbury
it
is
so
long
since
they
have
seen
each
other
i
do
think
priscilla
feels
it
the
same
way
because
she
is
so
brave
do
you
remember
when
it
was
first
proposed
that
i
should
come
here
i
am
so
glad
i
came
because
of
brooke
he
will
come
on
the
quite
early
and
i
do
so
hope
you
will
come
with
him
yours
most
affectionately
dorothy
stanbury
give
my
best
best
love
to
nora
chapter
xc
lady
rowley
conquered
illustration
when
the
rowleys
were
back
in
london
and
began
to
employ
themselves
on
the
terrible
work
of
making
ready
for
their
journey
to
the
islands
lady
rowley
gradually
gave
way
about
hugh
stanbury
she
had
become
aware
that
nora
would
not
go
back
with
them
unless
under
an
amount
of
pressure
which
she
would
find
it
impossible
to
use
and
if
nora
did
not
go
out
to
the
islands
what
was
to
become
of
her
unless
she
married
this
man
sir
marmaduke
when
all
was
explained
to
him
declared
that
a
girl
must
do
what
her
parents
ordered
her
to
do
other
girls
live
with
their
fathers
and
mothers
and
so
must
she
lady
rowley
endeavoured
to
explain
that
other
girls
lived
with
their
fathers
and
mothers
because
they
found
themselves
in
established
homes
from
which
they
are
not
disposed
to
run
away
but
position
was
as
she
alleged
very
different
nora
home
had
latterly
been
with
her
sister
and
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
the
parental
authority
should
not
find
itself
impaired
by
the
interregnum
which
had
taken
place
sir
marmaduke
would
not
see
the
thing
in
the
same
light
and
was
disposed
to
treat
his
daughter
with
a
high
hand
if
she
would
not
do
as
she
was
bidden
she
should
no
longer
be
daughter
of
his
in
answer
to
this
lady
rowley
could
only
repeat
her
conviction
that
nora
would
not
go
out
to
the
mandarins
and
that
as
for
disinheriting
her
casting
her
off
cursing
her
and
the
rest
she
had
no
belief
in
such
doings
at
all
on
the
stage
they
do
such
things
as
that
she
said
and
perhaps
they
used
to
do
it
once
in
reality
but
you
know
that
it
out
of
the
question
now
fancy
your
standing
up
and
cursing
at
the
dear
girl
just
as
we
are
all
starting
from
southampton
sir
marmaduke
knew
as
well
as
his
wife
that
it
would
be
impossible
and
only
muttered
something
about
the
dear
girl
behaving
herself
with
great
impropriety
they
were
all
aware
that
nora
was
not
going
to
leave
england
because
no
berth
had
been
taken
for
her
on
board
the
ship
and
because
while
the
other
girls
were
preparing
for
their
long
voyage
no
preparations
were
made
for
her
of
course
she
was
not
going
sir
marmaduke
would
probably
have
given
way
altogether
immediately
on
his
return
to
london
had
he
not
discussed
the
matter
with
his
friend
colonel
osborne
it
became
of
course
his
duty
to
make
some
inquiry
as
to
the
stanbury
family
and
he
knew
that
osborne
had
visited
stanbury
when
he
made
his
unfortunate
pilgrimage
to
the
porch
of
cockchaffington
church
he
told
osborne
the
whole
story
of
engagement
telling
also
that
other
most
tale
of
her
conduct
in
regard
to
glascock
and
asked
the
colonel
what
he
thought
about
the
stanburys
now
the
colonel
did
not
hold
the
stanburys
in
high
esteem
he
had
met
hugh
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
remember
and
had
had
some
intercourse
with
the
young
man
which
had
not
been
quite
agreeable
to
him
on
the
platform
of
the
railway
station
at
exeter
and
he
had
also
heard
something
of
the
ladies
at
nuncombe
putney
during
his
short
sojourn
at
the
house
of
crocket
my
belief
is
they
are
beggars
said
colonel
osborne
i
suppose
so
said
sir
marmaduke
shaking
his
head
when
i
went
over
to
call
on
emily
that
time
i
was
at
cockchaffington
you
know
when
trevelyan
made
himself
such
a
d
fool
i
found
the
mother
and
sister
living
in
a
decentish
house
enough
but
it
was
their
house
not
their
own
you
mean
it
was
a
place
that
trevelyan
had
got
this
young
man
to
take
for
emily
and
they
had
merely
gone
there
to
be
with
her
they
had
been
living
in
a
little
bit
of
a
cottage
a
sort
of
a
place
that
any
any
ploughman
would
live
in
just
that
kind
of
cottage
goodness
gracious
and
they
gone
to
another
just
like
it
so
i
told
and
ca
he
do
anything
better
for
them
than
that
asked
sir
marmaduke
i
know
nothing
about
him
i
have
met
him
you
know
he
used
to
be
with
trevelyan
that
was
when
nora
took
a
fancy
for
him
of
course
and
i
saw
him
once
down
in
devonshire
when
i
must
say
he
behaved
uncommonly
badly
doing
all
he
could
to
foster
trevelyan
stupid
jealousy
he
has
changed
his
mind
about
that
i
think
perhaps
he
has
but
he
behaved
very
badly
then
let
him
shew
up
his
income
that
i
take
it
is
the
question
in
such
a
case
as
this
his
father
was
a
clergyman
and
therefore
i
suppose
he
must
be
considered
to
be
a
gentleman
but
has
he
means
to
support
a
wife
and
keep
up
a
house
in
london
if
he
has
not
that
is
an
end
to
it
i
should
say
but
sir
marmaduke
could
not
see
his
way
to
any
such
end
and
although
he
still
looked
black
upon
nora
and
talked
to
his
wife
of
his
determination
to
stand
no
contumacy
and
hinted
at
cursing
disinheriting
and
the
like
he
began
to
perceive
that
nora
would
have
her
own
way
in
his
unhappiness
he
regretted
this
visit
to
england
and
almost
thought
that
the
mandarins
were
a
pleasanter
residence
than
london
he
could
do
pretty
much
as
he
pleased
there
and
could
live
quietly
without
the
trouble
which
encountered
him
now
on
every
side
nora
immediately
on
her
return
to
london
had
written
a
note
to
hugh
simply
telling
him
of
her
arrival
and
begging
him
to
come
and
see
her
mamma
she
said
i
must
see
him
and
it
would
be
nonsense
to
say
that
he
must
not
come
here
i
have
done
what
i
have
said
i
would
do
and
you
ought
not
to
make
difficulties
lady
rowley
declared
that
sir
marmaduke
would
be
very
angry
if
hugh
were
admitted
without
his
express
permission
i
do
want
to
do
anything
in
the
dark
continued
nora
but
of
course
i
must
see
him
i
suppose
it
will
be
better
that
he
should
come
to
me
than
that
i
should
go
to
him
lady
rowley
quite
understood
the
threat
that
was
conveyed
in
this
it
would
be
much
better
that
hugh
should
come
to
the
hotel
and
that
he
should
be
treated
then
as
an
accepted
lover
she
had
come
to
that
conclusion
but
she
was
obliged
to
vacillate
for
awhile
between
her
husband
and
her
daughter
hugh
came
of
course
and
sir
marmaduke
by
his
wife
advice
kept
out
of
the
way
lady
rowley
though
she
was
at
home
kept
herself
also
out
of
the
way
remaining
above
with
her
two
other
daughters
nora
thus
achieved
the
glory
and
happiness
of
receiving
her
lover
alone
my
own
true
girl
he
said
speaking
with
his
arms
still
round
her
waist
i
am
true
enough
but
whether
i
am
your
own
that
is
another
question
you
mean
to
be
but
papa
does
mean
it
papa
says
that
you
are
nobody
and
that
you
have
got
an
income
and
thinks
that
i
had
better
go
back
and
be
an
old
maid
at
the
mandarins
and
what
do
you
think
yourself
nora
what
do
i
think
as
far
as
i
can
understand
young
ladies
are
not
allowed
to
think
at
all
they
have
to
do
what
their
papas
tell
them
that
will
do
hugh
you
can
talk
without
taking
hold
of
me
it
is
such
a
time
since
i
have
had
a
hold
of
you
as
you
call
it
it
will
be
much
longer
before
you
can
do
so
again
if
i
go
back
to
the
islands
with
papa
i
shall
expect
you
to
be
true
you
know
and
it
will
be
ten
years
at
the
least
before
i
can
hope
to
be
home
again
i
do
think
you
mean
to
go
nora
but
what
am
i
to
do
that
idea
of
yours
of
walking
out
to
the
next
church
and
getting
ourselves
married
sounds
very
nice
and
independent
but
you
know
that
it
is
not
practicable
on
the
other
hand
i
know
it
is
it
is
not
practicable
for
me
hugh
of
all
things
in
the
world
i
do
want
to
be
a
lydia
i
wo
do
anything
that
anybody
shall
ever
say
that
your
wife
ought
not
to
have
done
young
women
when
they
are
married
ought
to
have
their
papas
and
mammas
consent
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
a
great
deal
for
the
last
month
or
two
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
that
what
is
it
all
to
come
to
then
i
mean
to
get
papa
consent
that
is
what
it
is
to
come
to
and
if
he
is
obstinate
i
shall
coax
him
round
at
last
when
the
time
for
going
comes
yield
then
but
you
will
not
go
with
them
as
he
asked
this
he
came
to
her
and
tried
again
to
take
her
by
the
waist
but
she
retreated
from
him
and
got
herself
clear
from
his
arm
if
you
are
afraid
of
me
i
shall
know
that
you
think
it
possible
that
we
may
be
parted
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
you
hugh
nora
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
something
definitely
i
think
i
have
been
definite
enough
sir
you
may
be
sure
of
this
however
i
will
not
go
back
to
the
islands
give
me
your
hand
on
that
there
is
my
hand
but
remember
i
had
told
you
just
as
much
before
i
do
mean
to
go
back
i
mean
to
stay
here
i
mean
but
i
do
not
think
i
will
tell
you
all
the
things
i
mean
to
do
you
mean
to
be
my
wife
certainly
some
day
when
the
difficulty
about
the
chairs
and
tables
can
settle
itself
the
real
question
now
is
what
am
i
to
do
with
myself
when
papa
and
mamma
are
gone
become
stanbury
at
once
chairs
and
tables
you
shall
have
chairs
and
tables
as
many
as
you
want
you
wo
be
too
proud
to
live
in
lodgings
for
a
few
months
there
must
be
preliminaries
hugh
even
for
lodgings
though
they
may
be
very
slender
papa
goes
in
less
than
three
weeks
now
and
mamma
has
got
something
else
to
think
of
than
my
marriage
garments
and
then
there
are
all
manner
of
difficulties
money
difficulties
and
others
out
of
which
i
do
see
my
way
yet
hugh
began
to
asseverate
that
it
was
his
business
to
help
her
through
all
money
difficulties
as
well
as
others
but
she
soon
stopped
his
eloquence
it
will
be
hugh
and
i
hope
you
support
the
burden
like
a
man
but
just
at
present
there
is
a
hitch
i
should
have
come
over
at
all
i
should
have
stayed
with
emily
in
italy
had
i
not
thought
that
i
was
bound
to
see
you
my
own
darling
when
papa
goes
i
think
that
i
had
better
go
back
to
her
i
take
you
said
hugh
picturing
to
himself
all
the
pleasures
of
such
a
tour
together
over
the
alps
no
you
wo
because
that
would
be
improper
when
we
travel
together
we
must
go
darby
and
joan
fashion
as
man
and
wife
i
think
i
had
better
go
back
to
emily
because
her
position
there
is
so
terrible
there
must
come
some
end
to
it
i
suppose
soon
he
will
be
better
or
he
will
become
so
bad
that
that
medical
interference
will
be
unavoidable
but
i
do
not
like
that
she
should
be
alone
she
gave
me
a
home
when
she
had
one
and
i
must
always
remember
that
i
met
you
there
after
this
there
was
of
course
another
attempt
with
hugh
right
arm
which
on
this
occasion
was
not
altogether
unsuccessful
and
then
she
told
him
of
her
friendship
for
glascock
wife
and
of
her
intention
at
some
future
time
to
visit
them
at
monkhams
illustration
i
must
always
remember
that
i
met
you
there
and
see
all
the
glories
that
might
have
been
your
own
he
said
and
think
of
the
young
man
who
has
robbed
me
of
them
all
and
you
are
to
go
there
too
so
that
you
may
see
what
you
have
done
there
was
a
time
hugh
when
i
was
very
nearly
pleasing
all
my
friends
and
shewing
myself
to
be
a
young
lady
of
high
taste
and
noble
fortune
and
an
obedient
good
girl
and
why
did
you
i
thought
i
would
wait
just
a
little
longer
because
because
because
oh
hugh
how
cross
you
were
to
me
afterwards
when
you
came
down
to
nuncombe
and
would
hardly
speak
to
me
and
why
did
i
speak
to
you
i
do
know
because
you
were
cross
and
surly
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
your
tobacco
i
believe
do
you
remember
how
we
walked
to
niddon
and
you
had
a
word
for
anybody
i
remember
i
wanted
you
to
go
down
to
the
river
with
me
and
you
would
go
you
asked
me
only
once
and
i
did
so
long
to
go
with
you
do
you
remember
the
rocks
in
the
river
i
remember
the
place
as
though
i
saw
it
now
and
how
i
longed
to
jump
from
one
stone
to
another
hugh
if
we
are
ever
married
you
must
take
me
there
and
let
me
jump
on
those
stones
you
pretended
that
you
could
not
think
of
wetting
your
feet
of
course
i
pretended
because
you
were
so
cross
and
so
cold
oh
dear
i
wonder
whether
you
will
ever
know
it
all
do
i
know
it
all
now
i
suppose
you
do
nearly
there
is
mighty
little
of
a
secret
in
it
and
it
is
the
same
thing
that
is
going
on
always
only
it
seems
so
strange
to
me
that
i
should
ever
have
loved
any
one
so
dearly
and
that
for
next
to
no
reason
at
all
you
never
made
yourself
very
charming
that
i
know
of
did
you
i
did
my
best
it
was
much
i
dare
say
you
did
nothing
sir
except
just
let
me
fall
in
love
with
you
and
you
were
not
quite
sure
that
you
would
let
me
do
that
nora
i
do
think
you
do
understand
i
do
perfectly
why
were
you
cross
with
me
instead
of
saying
one
nice
word
when
you
were
down
at
nuncombe
i
do
understand
why
was
it
because
you
did
not
think
well
enough
of
me
to
believe
that
i
would
give
myself
to
a
man
who
had
no
fortune
of
his
own
i
know
it
now
and
i
knew
it
then
and
therefore
i
would
dabble
in
the
river
with
you
but
it
all
over
now
and
we
go
and
get
wet
together
like
dear
little
children
and
priscilla
shall
scold
us
when
we
come
back
they
were
alone
in
the
for
more
than
an
hour
and
lady
rowley
was
patient
as
mothers
will
be
patient
in
such
emergencies
sophie
and
lucy
had
gone
out
and
left
her
and
there
she
remained
telling
herself
as
the
weary
minutes
went
by
that
as
the
thing
was
to
be
it
was
well
that
the
young
people
should
be
together
hugh
stanbury
could
never
be
to
her
what
glascock
would
have
been
a
to
sit
and
think
about
and
dream
of
and
be
proud
of
whose
existence
as
her
would
in
itself
have
been
a
happiness
to
her
out
in
her
banishment
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
but
nevertheless
it
was
natural
to
her
as
a
loving
mother
with
many
daughters
that
any
should
be
dear
to
her
now
that
she
had
gradually
brought
herself
round
to
believe
in
nora
marriage
she
was
disposed
to
make
the
best
of
hugh
to
remember
that
he
was
certainly
a
clever
man
that
he
was
an
honest
fellow
and
that
she
had
heard
of
him
as
a
good
son
and
a
kind
brother
and
that
he
had
behaved
well
in
reference
to
her
emily
and
trevelyan
she
was
quite
willing
now
that
hugh
should
be
happy
and
she
sat
there
thinking
that
the
time
was
very
long
but
still
waiting
patiently
till
she
should
be
summoned
you
must
let
me
go
for
mamma
for
a
moment
nora
said
i
want
you
to
see
her
and
make
yourself
a
good
boy
before
her
if
you
are
ever
to
be
her
you
ought
to
be
in
her
good
graces
hugh
declared
that
he
would
do
his
best
and
nora
fetched
her
mother
stanbury
found
some
difficulty
in
making
himself
a
good
boy
in
lady
rowley
presence
and
lady
rowley
herself
for
some
time
felt
very
strongly
the
awkwardness
of
the
meeting
she
had
never
formally
recognised
the
young
man
as
her
daughter
accepted
suitor
and
was
not
yet
justified
in
doing
so
by
any
permission
from
sir
marmaduke
but
as
the
young
people
had
been
for
the
last
hour
or
two
alone
together
with
her
connivance
and
sanction
it
was
indispensable
that
she
should
in
some
way
signify
her
parental
adherence
to
the
arrangement
nora
began
by
talking
about
emily
and
condition
and
mode
of
living
were
discussed
then
lady
rowley
said
something
about
their
coming
journey
and
hugh
with
a
lucky
blunder
spoke
of
nora
intended
return
to
italy
we
do
know
how
that
may
be
said
lady
rowley
her
papa
still
wishes
her
to
go
back
with
us
mamma
you
know
that
that
is
impossible
said
nora
not
impossible
my
love
but
she
will
not
go
back
said
hugh
lady
rowley
you
would
not
propose
to
separate
us
by
such
a
distance
as
that
it
is
sir
marmaduke
that
you
must
ask
mamma
mamma
exclaimed
nora
rushing
to
her
mother
side
it
is
not
papa
that
we
must
ask
not
now
we
want
you
to
be
our
friend
do
we
hugh
and
mamma
if
you
will
really
be
our
friend
of
course
papa
will
come
round
my
dear
nora
you
know
he
will
mamma
and
you
know
that
you
mean
to
be
good
and
kind
to
us
of
course
i
ca
go
back
to
the
islands
with
you
how
could
i
go
so
far
and
leave
him
behind
he
might
have
wives
before
i
could
get
back
to
him
if
you
have
not
more
trust
in
him
than
that
long
engagements
are
awful
bores
said
hugh
finding
it
to
be
necessary
that
he
also
should
press
forward
his
argument
i
can
trust
him
as
far
as
i
can
see
him
said
nora
and
therefore
i
do
not
want
to
lose
sight
of
him
altogether
lady
rowley
of
course
gave
way
and
embraced
her
accepted
after
all
it
might
have
been
worse
he
saw
his
way
clearly
he
said
to
making
six
hundred
a
year
and
did
not
at
all
doubt
that
before
long
he
would
do
better
than
that
he
proposed
that
they
should
be
married
some
time
in
the
autumn
but
was
willing
to
acknowledge
that
much
must
depend
on
the
position
of
trevelyan
and
his
wife
he
would
hold
himself
ready
at
any
moment
he
said
to
start
to
italy
and
would
do
all
that
could
be
done
by
a
brother
then
lady
rowley
gave
him
her
blessing
and
kissed
him
again
and
nora
kissed
him
too
and
hung
upon
him
and
did
not
push
him
away
at
all
when
his
arm
crept
round
her
waist
and
that
feeling
came
upon
him
which
must
surely
be
acknowledged
by
all
engaged
young
men
when
they
first
find
themselves
encouraged
by
mammas
in
the
taking
of
liberties
which
they
have
hitherto
regarded
as
mysteries
to
be
hidden
especially
from
maternal
eyes
that
feeling
of
being
a
fine
fat
calf
decked
out
with
ribbons
for
a
sacrifice
chapter
xci
four
in
the
morning
another
week
went
by
and
sir
marmaduke
had
even
yet
not
surrendered
he
quite
understood
that
nora
was
not
to
go
back
to
the
islands
and
he
had
visited
and
outhouse
at
diddulph
in
order
to
secure
a
home
for
her
there
if
it
might
be
possible
outhouse
did
not
refuse
but
gave
the
permission
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
make
it
almost
equal
to
a
refusal
he
was
he
said
much
attached
to
his
niece
nora
but
he
had
heard
that
there
was
a
love
affair
sir
marmaduke
of
course
could
not
deny
the
love
affair
there
was
certainly
a
love
affair
of
which
he
did
not
personally
approve
as
the
gentleman
had
no
fixed
income
and
as
far
as
he
could
understand
no
fixed
profession
such
a
love
affair
thought
outhouse
was
a
sort
of
thing
that
he
did
know
how
to
manage
at
all
if
nora
came
to
him
was
the
young
man
to
visit
at
the
house
or
was
he
not
then
outhouse
said
something
as
to
the
necessity
of
an
pledge
on
nora
part
and
sir
marmaduke
found
that
that
scheme
must
be
abandoned
trevelyan
had
written
from
florence
more
than
once
or
twice
and
in
her
last
letter
had
said
that
she
would
prefer
not
to
have
nora
with
her
she
was
at
that
time
living
in
lodgings
at
siena
and
had
her
boy
there
also
she
saw
her
husband
every
other
day
but
nevertheless
according
to
her
statements
her
visits
to
casalunga
were
made
in
opposition
to
his
wishes
he
had
even
expressed
a
desire
that
she
should
leave
siena
and
return
to
england
he
had
once
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
she
would
do
so
he
would
follow
her
but
she
clearly
did
not
believe
him
and
in
all
her
letters
spoke
of
him
as
one
whom
she
could
not
regard
as
being
under
the
guidance
of
reason
she
had
taken
her
child
with
her
once
or
twice
to
the
house
and
on
the
first
occasion
trevelyan
had
made
much
of
his
son
had
wept
over
him
and
professed
that
in
losing
him
he
had
lost
his
only
treasure
but
after
that
he
had
not
noticed
the
boy
and
latterly
she
had
gone
alone
she
thought
that
perhaps
her
visits
cheered
him
breaking
the
intensity
of
his
solitude
but
he
never
expressed
himself
gratified
by
them
never
asked
her
to
remain
at
the
house
never
returned
with
her
into
siena
and
continually
spoke
of
her
return
to
england
as
a
step
which
must
be
taken
soon
and
the
sooner
the
better
he
intended
to
follow
her
he
said
and
she
explained
very
fully
how
manifest
was
his
wish
that
she
should
go
by
the
temptation
to
do
so
which
he
thought
that
he
held
out
by
this
promise
he
had
spoken
on
every
occasion
of
her
presence
with
him
of
sir
marmaduke
attempt
to
prove
him
to
be
a
madman
but
declared
that
he
was
afraid
of
no
one
in
england
and
would
face
all
the
lawyers
in
chancery
lane
and
all
the
doctors
in
savile
row
nevertheless
so
said
trevelyan
he
would
undoubtedly
remain
at
casalunga
till
after
sir
marmaduke
should
have
sailed
he
was
not
so
mad
but
that
he
knew
that
no
one
else
would
be
so
keen
to
take
steps
against
him
as
would
sir
marmaduke
as
for
his
health
her
account
of
him
was
very
sad
he
seemed
she
said
to
be
withering
away
his
hand
was
mere
skin
and
bone
his
hair
and
beard
so
covered
his
thin
long
cheeks
that
there
was
nothing
left
of
his
face
but
his
bright
large
melancholy
eyes
his
legs
had
become
so
frail
and
weak
that
they
would
hardly
bear
his
weight
as
he
walked
and
his
clothes
though
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
throw
aside
all
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
england
hung
so
loose
about
him
that
they
seemed
as
though
they
would
fall
from
him
once
she
had
ventured
to
send
out
to
him
from
siena
a
doctor
to
whom
she
had
been
recommended
in
florence
but
he
had
taken
the
visit
in
very
bad
part
had
told
the
gentleman
that
he
had
no
need
for
any
medical
services
and
had
been
furious
with
her
because
of
her
offence
in
having
sent
such
a
visitor
he
had
told
her
that
if
ever
she
ventured
to
take
such
a
liberty
again
he
would
demand
the
child
back
and
refuse
her
permission
inside
the
gates
of
casalunga
do
come
at
any
rate
till
i
send
for
you
trevelyan
said
in
her
last
letter
to
her
sister
your
being
here
would
do
no
good
and
would
i
think
make
him
feel
that
he
was
being
watched
my
hope
is
at
last
to
get
him
to
return
with
me
if
you
were
here
i
think
this
would
be
less
likely
and
then
why
should
you
be
mixed
up
with
such
unutterable
sadness
and
distress
more
than
is
essentially
necessary
my
health
stands
wonderfully
well
though
the
heat
here
is
very
great
it
is
cooler
at
casalunga
than
in
the
town
of
which
i
am
glad
for
his
sake
he
perspires
so
profusely
that
it
seems
to
me
he
can
not
stand
the
waste
much
longer
i
know
he
will
not
go
to
england
as
long
as
papa
is
there
but
i
hope
that
he
may
be
induced
to
do
so
by
slow
stages
as
soon
as
he
knows
that
papa
has
gone
mind
you
send
me
a
newspaper
so
that
he
may
see
it
stated
in
print
that
papa
has
sailed
it
followed
as
one
consequence
of
these
letters
from
florence
that
nora
was
debarred
from
the
italian
scheme
as
a
mode
of
passing
her
time
till
some
house
should
be
open
for
her
reception
she
had
suggested
to
hugh
that
she
might
go
for
a
few
weeks
to
nuncombe
putney
but
he
had
explained
to
her
the
nature
of
his
cottage
and
had
told
her
that
there
was
no
hole
there
in
which
she
could
lay
her
head
there
never
was
such
a
forlorn
young
woman
she
said
when
papa
goes
i
shall
literally
be
without
shelter
there
had
come
a
letter
from
glascock
at
least
it
was
signed
caroline
glascock
though
another
name
might
have
been
used
dated
from
milan
saying
that
they
were
hurrying
back
to
naples
even
at
that
season
of
the
year
because
lord
peterborough
was
dead
and
she
is
lady
peterborough
said
lady
rowley
unable
to
repress
the
expression
of
the
old
regrets
of
course
she
is
lady
peterborough
mamma
what
else
should
she
be
though
she
does
not
so
sign
herself
we
think
said
the
american
peeress
that
we
shall
be
at
monkhams
before
the
end
of
august
and
charles
says
that
you
are
to
come
just
the
same
there
will
be
nobody
else
there
of
course
because
of
lord
peterborough
death
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
said
sir
marmaduke
and
quite
forgot
to
mention
it
that
same
evening
there
was
a
long
family
discussion
about
prospects
they
were
all
together
in
the
gloomy
at
gregg
hotel
and
sir
marmaduke
had
not
yielded
the
ladies
had
begun
to
feel
that
it
would
be
well
not
to
press
him
to
yield
practically
he
had
yielded
there
was
now
no
question
of
cursing
and
of
disinheritance
nora
was
to
remain
in
england
of
course
with
the
intention
of
being
married
to
hugh
stanbury
and
the
difficulty
consisted
in
the
need
of
an
immediate
home
for
her
it
wanted
now
but
twelve
days
to
that
on
which
the
family
were
to
sail
from
southampton
and
nothing
had
been
settled
if
papa
will
allow
me
something
ever
so
small
and
will
trust
me
i
will
live
alone
in
lodgings
said
nora
it
is
the
maddest
thing
i
ever
heard
said
sir
marmaduke
who
would
take
care
of
you
nora
asked
lady
rowley
and
who
would
walk
about
with
you
said
lucy
i
do
see
how
it
would
be
possible
to
live
alone
like
that
said
sophie
nobody
would
take
care
of
me
and
nobody
would
walk
about
with
me
and
i
could
live
alone
very
well
said
nora
i
do
see
why
a
young
woman
is
to
be
supposed
to
be
so
absolutely
helpless
as
all
that
comes
to
of
course
it
wo
be
very
nice
but
it
need
not
be
for
long
why
not
for
long
asked
sir
marmaduke
not
for
very
long
said
nora
it
does
not
seem
to
me
said
sir
marmaduke
after
a
considerable
pause
that
this
gentleman
himself
is
so
particularly
anxious
for
the
match
i
have
heard
no
day
named
and
no
rational
proposition
made
papa
that
is
unfair
most
unfair
and
ungenerous
nora
said
her
mother
do
not
speak
in
that
way
to
your
father
mamma
it
is
unfair
papa
accuses
stanbury
of
being
being
lukewarm
and
untrue
of
not
being
in
earnest
i
would
rather
that
he
were
not
in
earnest
said
sir
marmaduke
stanbury
is
ready
at
any
time
continued
nora
he
would
have
the
banns
at
once
read
and
marry
me
in
three
weeks
if
i
would
let
him
good
gracious
nora
exclaimed
lady
rowley
but
i
have
refused
to
name
any
day
or
to
make
any
arrangement
because
i
did
not
wish
to
do
so
before
papa
had
given
his
consent
that
is
why
things
are
in
this
way
if
papa
will
but
let
me
take
a
room
till
i
can
go
to
monkhams
i
will
have
everything
arranged
from
there
you
can
trust
glascock
for
that
and
you
can
trust
her
i
suppose
your
papa
will
make
you
some
allowance
said
lady
rowley
she
is
entitled
to
nothing
as
she
has
refused
to
go
to
her
proper
home
said
sir
marmaduke
the
conversation
which
had
now
become
very
disagreeable
was
not
allowed
to
go
any
further
and
it
was
well
that
it
should
be
interrupted
they
all
knew
that
sir
marmaduke
must
be
brought
round
by
degrees
and
that
both
nora
and
lady
rowley
had
gone
as
far
as
was
prudent
at
present
but
all
trouble
on
this
head
was
suddenly
ended
for
this
evening
by
the
entrance
of
the
waiter
with
a
telegram
it
was
addressed
to
lady
rowley
and
she
opened
it
with
trembling
hands
as
ladies
always
do
open
telegrams
it
was
from
emily
trevelyan
louis
is
much
worse
let
somebody
come
to
me
hugh
stanbury
would
be
the
best
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
so
much
disturbed
that
no
one
quite
knew
what
should
be
done
at
once
lady
rowley
began
by
declaring
that
she
would
go
herself
sir
marmaduke
of
course
pointed
out
that
this
was
impossible
and
suggested
that
he
would
send
a
lawyer
nora
professed
herself
ready
to
start
immediately
on
the
journey
but
was
stopped
by
a
proposition
from
her
sister
lucy
that
in
that
case
hugh
stanbury
would
of
course
go
with
her
lady
rowley
asked
whether
hugh
would
go
and
nora
asserted
that
he
would
go
immediately
as
a
matter
of
course
she
was
sure
he
would
go
let
the
people
at
the
say
what
they
might
according
to
her
there
was
always
somebody
at
the
call
of
the
editor
of
the
to
do
the
work
of
anybody
else
when
anybody
else
wanted
to
go
away
sir
marmaduke
shook
his
head
and
was
very
uneasy
he
still
thought
that
a
lawyer
would
be
best
feeling
no
doubt
that
if
stanbury
services
were
used
on
such
an
occasion
there
must
be
an
end
of
all
opposition
to
the
marriage
but
before
was
over
stanbury
was
sent
for
the
boots
of
the
hotel
went
off
in
a
cab
to
the
office
of
the
with
a
note
from
lady
rowley
dear
stanbury
we
have
had
a
telegram
from
emily
and
want
to
see
you
please
come
we
shall
sit
up
and
wait
for
you
till
you
do
e
it
was
very
distressing
to
them
because
let
the
result
be
what
it
might
it
was
all
but
impossible
that
trevelyan
should
be
with
them
before
they
had
sailed
and
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
that
they
should
now
postpone
their
journey
were
stanbury
to
start
by
the
morning
train
on
the
following
day
he
could
not
reach
siena
till
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
and
let
the
result
be
what
it
might
when
he
arrived
there
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
that
emily
trevelyan
should
come
back
quite
at
once
or
that
she
should
travel
at
the
same
speed
of
course
they
might
hear
again
by
telegram
and
also
by
letter
but
they
could
not
see
her
or
have
any
hand
in
her
plans
if
anything
were
to
happen
she
might
have
come
with
us
said
lady
rowley
it
is
out
of
the
question
said
sir
marmaduke
gloomily
i
could
not
give
up
the
places
i
have
taken
a
few
days
more
would
have
done
it
i
do
suppose
she
would
wish
to
go
said
nora
of
course
she
would
not
take
louey
there
why
should
she
and
then
i
do
suppose
he
is
so
ill
as
that
there
is
no
saying
said
sir
marmaduke
it
was
very
evident
that
whatever
might
be
sir
marmaduke
opinion
he
had
no
wish
for
his
recovery
they
all
sat
up
waiting
for
hugh
stanbury
till
eleven
twelve
one
and
two
at
night
the
boots
had
returned
saying
that
stanbury
had
not
been
at
the
office
of
the
newspaper
but
that
according
to
information
received
he
certainly
would
be
there
that
night
no
other
address
had
been
given
to
the
man
and
the
note
had
therefore
of
necessity
been
left
at
the
office
sir
marmaduke
became
very
fretful
and
was
evidently
desirous
of
being
liberated
from
his
night
watch
but
he
could
not
go
himself
and
shewed
his
impatience
by
endeavouring
to
send
the
others
away
lady
rowley
replied
for
herself
that
she
should
certainly
remain
in
her
corner
on
the
sofa
all
night
if
it
were
necessary
and
as
she
slept
very
soundly
in
her
corner
her
comfort
was
not
much
impaired
nora
was
pertinacious
in
refusing
to
go
to
bed
i
should
only
go
to
my
own
room
papa
and
remain
there
she
said
of
course
i
must
speak
to
him
before
he
goes
sophie
and
lucy
considered
that
they
had
as
much
right
to
sit
up
as
nora
and
submitted
to
be
called
geese
and
idiots
by
their
father
sir
marmaduke
had
arisen
with
a
snort
from
a
short
slumber
and
had
just
sworn
that
he
and
everybody
else
should
go
to
bed
when
there
came
a
ring
at
the
bell
the
trusty
boots
had
also
remained
up
and
in
two
minutes
hugh
stanbury
was
in
the
room
he
had
to
make
his
excuses
before
anything
else
could
be
said
when
he
reached
the
office
between
ten
and
eleven
it
was
absolutely
incumbent
on
him
to
write
a
leading
article
before
he
left
it
he
had
been
in
the
reporter
gallery
of
the
house
all
the
evening
and
he
had
come
away
laden
with
his
article
it
was
certainly
better
that
we
should
remain
up
than
that
the
whole
town
should
be
disappointed
said
sir
marmaduke
with
something
of
a
sneer
it
is
so
very
very
good
of
you
to
come
said
nora
indeed
it
is
said
lady
rowley
but
we
were
quite
sure
you
would
come
having
kissed
and
blessed
him
as
her
lady
rowley
was
now
prepared
to
love
him
almost
as
well
as
though
he
had
been
lord
peterborough
perhaps
stanbury
we
had
better
show
you
this
telegram
said
sir
marmaduke
who
had
been
standing
with
the
scrap
of
paper
in
his
hand
since
the
ring
of
the
bell
had
been
heard
hugh
took
the
message
and
read
it
i
do
not
know
what
should
have
made
my
daughter
mention
your
name
continued
sir
marmaduke
but
as
she
has
done
so
and
as
perhaps
the
unfortunate
invalid
himself
may
have
alluded
to
you
we
thought
it
best
to
send
for
you
no
doubt
it
was
best
sir
marmaduke
we
are
so
situated
that
i
can
not
go
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
we
should
leave
town
for
southampton
on
friday
week
the
ship
sails
on
saturday
i
will
go
as
a
matter
of
course
said
hugh
i
will
start
at
once
at
any
time
to
tell
the
truth
when
i
got
lady
rowley
note
i
thought
that
it
was
to
be
so
trevelyan
and
i
were
very
intimate
at
one
time
and
it
may
be
that
he
will
receive
me
without
displeasure
there
was
much
to
be
discussed
and
considerable
difficulty
in
the
discussion
this
was
enhanced
too
by
the
feeling
in
the
minds
of
all
of
them
that
hugh
and
sir
marmaduke
would
not
meet
again
probably
for
many
years
were
they
to
part
now
on
terms
of
close
affection
or
were
they
to
part
almost
as
strangers
had
lucy
and
sophie
not
persistently
remained
up
nora
would
have
faced
the
difficulty
and
taken
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
asked
her
father
to
sanction
her
engagement
in
the
presence
of
her
lover
but
she
could
not
do
it
before
so
many
persons
even
though
the
persons
were
her
own
nearest
relatives
and
then
there
arose
another
embarrassment
sir
marmaduke
who
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
stanbury
was
so
poor
as
hardly
to
have
the
price
of
a
dinner
in
his
pocket
although
in
fact
our
friend
hugh
was
probably
the
richer
man
of
the
two
said
something
about
defraying
the
cost
of
the
journey
it
is
taken
altogether
on
our
behalf
said
sir
marmaduke
hugh
became
red
in
the
face
looked
angry
and
muttered
a
word
or
two
about
trevelyan
being
the
oldest
friend
he
had
in
the
world
even
if
there
were
nothing
else
sir
marmaduke
felt
ashamed
of
himself
without
cause
indeed
for
the
offer
was
natural
said
nothing
further
about
it
but
appeared
to
be
more
stiff
and
ungainly
than
ever
the
bradshaw
was
had
out
and
consulted
and
nearly
half
an
hour
was
spent
in
poring
over
that
wondrous
volume
it
is
the
fashion
to
abuse
bradshaw
we
speak
now
especially
of
bradshaw
the
continental
because
all
the
minutest
details
of
the
autumn
tour
just
as
the
tourist
thinks
that
it
may
be
made
can
not
be
made
patent
to
him
at
once
without
close
research
amidst
crowded
figures
after
much
experience
we
make
bold
to
say
that
bradshaw
knows
more
and
will
divulge
more
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
properest
mode
of
getting
from
any
city
in
europe
to
any
other
city
more
than
fifty
miles
distant
than
can
be
learned
in
that
first
city
in
a
single
morning
with
the
aid
of
a
courier
a
carriage
a
pair
of
horses
and
all
the
temper
that
any
ordinary
tourist
possesses
the
bradshaw
was
had
out
and
it
was
at
last
discovered
that
nothing
could
be
gained
in
the
journey
from
london
to
siena
by
starting
in
the
morning
intending
as
he
did
to
travel
through
without
sleeping
on
the
road
stanbury
could
not
do
better
than
leave
london
by
the
night
mail
train
and
this
he
determined
to
do
but
when
that
was
arranged
then
came
the
nature
of
his
commission
what
was
he
to
do
no
commission
could
be
given
to
him
a
telegram
should
be
sent
to
emily
the
next
morning
to
say
that
he
was
coming
and
then
he
would
hurry
on
and
take
his
orders
from
her
they
were
all
in
doubt
terribly
in
doubt
whether
the
aggravated
malady
of
which
the
telegram
spoke
was
malady
of
the
mind
or
of
the
body
if
of
the
former
nature
then
the
difficulty
might
be
very
great
indeed
and
it
would
be
highly
expedient
that
stanbury
should
have
some
one
in
italy
to
assist
him
it
was
nora
who
suggested
that
he
should
carry
a
letter
of
introduction
to
spalding
and
it
was
she
who
wrote
it
sir
marmaduke
had
not
foregathered
very
closely
with
the
english
minister
and
nothing
was
said
of
assistance
that
should
be
peculiarly
british
then
at
last
about
three
or
four
in
the
morning
came
the
moment
for
parting
sir
marmaduke
had
suggested
that
stanbury
should
dine
with
them
on
the
next
day
before
he
started
but
hugh
had
declined
alleging
that
as
the
day
was
at
his
command
it
must
be
devoted
to
the
work
of
providing
for
his
absence
in
truth
sir
marmaduke
had
given
the
invitation
with
a
surly
voice
and
hugh
though
he
was
ready
to
go
to
the
north
pole
for
any
others
of
the
family
was
at
the
moment
in
an
aggressive
mood
of
mind
towards
sir
marmaduke
i
will
send
a
message
directly
i
get
there
he
said
holding
lady
rowley
by
the
hand
and
will
write
fully
to
you
immediately
god
bless
you
my
dear
friend
said
lady
rowley
crying
good
night
sir
marmaduke
said
hugh
good
night
mr
stanbury
then
he
gave
a
hand
to
the
two
girls
each
of
whom
as
she
took
it
sobbed
and
looked
away
from
nora
nora
was
standing
away
from
them
by
herself
and
away
from
the
door
holding
on
to
her
chair
and
with
her
hands
clasped
together
she
had
prepared
nothing
not
a
word
or
an
attitude
not
a
thought
for
his
farewell
but
she
had
felt
that
it
was
coming
and
had
known
that
she
must
trust
to
him
for
a
cue
for
her
own
demeanour
if
he
could
say
adieu
with
a
quiet
voice
and
simply
with
a
touch
of
the
hand
then
would
she
do
the
same
and
endeavour
to
think
no
worse
of
him
nor
had
he
prepared
anything
but
when
the
moment
came
he
could
not
leave
her
after
that
fashion
he
stood
a
moment
hesitating
not
approaching
her
and
merely
called
her
by
her
name
nora
for
a
moment
she
was
still
for
a
moment
she
held
by
her
chair
and
then
she
rushed
into
his
arms
he
did
not
much
care
for
her
father
now
but
kissed
her
hair
and
her
forehead
and
held
her
closely
to
his
bosom
my
own
own
nora
it
was
necessary
that
sir
marmaduke
should
say
something
there
was
at
first
a
little
scene
between
all
the
women
during
which
he
arranged
his
deportment
stanbury
he
said
let
it
be
so
i
could
wish
for
my
child
sake
and
also
for
your
own
that
your
means
of
living
were
less
precarious
hugh
accepted
this
simply
as
an
authority
for
another
embrace
and
then
he
allowed
them
all
to
go
to
bed
chapter
xcii
trevelyan
discourses
on
life
stanbury
made
his
journey
without
pause
or
hindrance
till
he
reached
florence
and
as
the
train
for
siena
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
remain
there
for
four
or
five
hours
he
went
to
an
inn
and
dressed
and
washed
himself
and
had
a
meal
and
was
then
driven
to
spalding
house
he
found
the
american
minister
at
home
and
was
received
with
cordiality
but
spalding
could
tell
him
little
or
nothing
about
trevelyan
they
went
up
to
spalding
room
and
hugh
was
told
by
her
that
she
had
seen
trevelyan
once
since
her
niece
marriage
and
that
then
she
had
represented
her
husband
as
being
very
feeble
hugh
in
the
midst
of
his
troubles
was
amused
by
a
second
and
a
third
perhaps
by
a
fourth
reference
to
lady
peterborough
spalding
latest
tidings
as
to
the
trevelyans
had
been
received
through
lady
peterborough
from
nora
rowley
lady
peterborough
was
at
the
present
moment
at
naples
but
was
expected
to
pass
north
through
florence
in
a
day
or
two
they
the
spaldings
themselves
were
kept
in
florence
in
this
very
hot
weather
by
this
circumstance
they
were
going
up
to
the
tyrolese
mountains
for
a
few
weeks
as
soon
as
lady
peterborough
should
have
left
them
for
england
lady
peterborough
would
have
been
so
happy
to
make
stanbury
acquaintance
and
to
have
heard
something
direct
from
her
friend
nora
then
spalding
smiled
archly
showing
thereby
that
she
knew
all
about
hugh
stanbury
and
his
relation
to
nora
rowley
from
all
which
and
in
accordance
with
the
teaching
which
we
got
alas
now
many
years
ago
from
a
great
master
on
the
subject
we
must
conclude
that
poor
dear
spalding
was
a
snob
nevertheless
with
all
deference
to
the
memory
of
that
great
master
we
think
that
spalding
allusions
to
the
success
in
life
achieved
by
her
niece
were
natural
and
altogether
pardonable
and
that
reticence
on
the
subject
a
calculated
determination
to
abstain
from
mentioning
a
triumph
which
must
have
been
very
dear
to
her
would
have
betrayed
on
the
whole
a
condition
of
mind
lower
than
that
which
she
exhibited
while
rank
wealth
and
money
are
held
to
be
good
things
by
all
around
us
let
them
be
acknowledged
as
such
it
is
natural
that
a
mother
should
be
as
proud
when
her
daughter
marries
an
earl
heir
as
when
her
son
becomes
senior
wrangler
and
when
we
meet
a
lady
in
spalding
condition
who
purposely
abstains
from
mentioning
the
name
of
her
titled
daughter
we
shall
be
disposed
to
judge
harshly
of
the
secret
workings
of
that
lady
thoughts
on
the
subject
we
prefer
the
exhibition
which
we
feel
to
be
natural
spalding
got
our
friend
by
the
and
was
making
him
a
speech
on
the
perilous
condition
in
which
trevelyan
was
placed
but
stanbury
urged
by
the
circumstances
of
his
position
pulled
out
his
watch
pleaded
the
hour
and
escaped
he
found
trevelyan
waiting
for
him
at
the
station
at
siena
he
would
hardly
have
known
her
not
from
any
alteration
that
was
physically
personal
to
herself
not
that
she
had
become
older
in
face
or
thin
or
grey
or
sickly
but
that
the
trouble
of
her
life
had
robbed
her
for
the
time
of
that
brightness
of
apparel
of
that
pride
of
feminine
gear
of
that
sheen
of
womanly
bearing
with
which
our
wives
and
daughters
are
so
careful
to
invest
themselves
she
knew
herself
to
be
a
wretched
woman
whose
work
in
life
now
was
to
watch
over
a
poor
prostrate
wretch
and
who
had
thrown
behind
her
all
ideas
of
grace
and
beauty
it
was
not
quickly
that
this
condition
had
come
upon
her
she
had
been
unhappy
at
nuncombe
putney
but
unhappiness
had
not
then
told
upon
the
outward
woman
she
had
been
more
wretched
still
at
diddulph
and
all
the
outward
circumstances
of
life
in
her
uncle
parsonage
had
been
very
wearisome
to
her
but
she
had
striven
against
it
all
and
the
sheen
and
outward
brightness
had
still
been
there
after
that
her
child
had
been
taken
from
her
and
the
days
which
she
had
passed
in
manchester
street
had
been
very
grievous
but
even
yet
she
had
not
given
way
it
was
not
till
her
child
had
been
brought
back
to
her
and
she
had
seen
the
life
which
her
husband
was
living
and
that
her
anger
hot
anger
had
been
changed
to
pity
and
that
with
pity
love
had
returned
it
was
not
till
this
point
had
come
in
her
sad
life
that
her
dress
became
always
black
and
sombre
that
a
veil
habitually
covered
her
face
that
a
bonnet
took
the
place
of
the
jaunty
hat
that
she
had
worn
and
that
the
prettinesses
of
her
life
were
lain
aside
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
she
said
very
good
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
i
was
so
wretched
on
the
day
that
i
sent
he
was
so
bad
that
i
was
obliged
to
do
something
stanbury
of
course
inquired
after
trevelyan
health
as
they
were
being
driven
up
to
trevelyan
lodgings
on
the
day
on
which
she
had
sent
the
telegram
her
husband
had
again
been
furiously
angry
with
her
she
had
interfered
or
had
endeavoured
to
interfere
in
some
arrangements
as
to
his
health
and
comfort
and
he
had
turned
upon
her
with
an
order
that
the
child
should
be
at
once
sent
back
to
him
and
that
she
should
immediately
quit
siena
when
i
said
that
louey
could
not
be
sent
and
who
could
send
a
child
into
such
keeping
he
told
me
that
i
was
the
basest
liar
that
ever
broke
a
promise
and
the
vilest
traitor
that
had
ever
returned
evil
for
good
i
was
never
to
come
to
him
again
never
and
the
gate
of
the
house
would
be
closed
against
me
if
i
appeared
there
on
the
next
day
she
had
gone
again
however
and
had
seen
him
and
had
visited
him
on
every
day
since
nothing
further
had
been
said
about
the
child
and
he
had
now
become
almost
too
weak
for
violent
anger
i
told
him
you
were
coming
and
though
he
would
not
say
so
i
think
he
is
glad
of
it
he
expects
you
i
will
go
this
evening
if
he
will
let
me
not
i
think
he
goes
to
bed
almost
as
the
sun
sets
i
am
never
there
myself
after
four
or
five
in
the
afternoon
i
told
him
that
you
should
be
there
alone
i
have
hired
a
little
carriage
and
you
can
take
it
he
said
specially
that
i
was
not
to
come
with
you
papa
goes
certainly
on
next
saturday
it
was
a
saturday
now
this
day
on
which
stanbury
had
arrived
at
siena
he
leaves
town
on
friday
you
must
make
him
believe
that
do
not
tell
him
suddenly
but
bring
it
in
by
degrees
he
thinks
that
i
am
deceiving
him
he
would
go
back
if
he
knew
that
papa
were
gone
they
spent
a
long
evening
together
and
stanbury
learned
all
that
trevelyan
could
tell
him
of
her
husband
state
there
was
no
doubt
she
said
that
his
reason
was
affected
but
she
thought
the
state
of
his
mind
was
diseased
in
a
ratio
the
reverse
of
that
of
his
body
and
that
when
he
was
weakest
in
health
then
were
his
ideas
the
most
clear
and
rational
he
never
now
mentioned
colonel
name
but
would
refer
to
the
affairs
of
the
last
two
years
as
though
they
had
been
governed
by
an
inexorable
fate
which
had
utterly
destroyed
his
happiness
without
any
fault
on
his
part
you
may
be
sure
she
said
that
i
never
accuse
him
even
when
he
says
terrible
things
of
me
which
he
does
i
never
excuse
myself
i
do
not
think
i
should
answer
a
word
if
he
called
me
the
vilest
thing
on
earth
before
they
parted
for
the
night
many
questions
were
of
course
asked
about
nora
and
hugh
described
the
condition
in
which
he
and
she
stood
to
each
other
papa
has
consented
then
yes
at
four
in
the
morning
just
as
i
was
leaving
them
and
when
is
it
to
be
nothing
has
been
settled
and
i
do
not
as
yet
know
where
she
will
go
to
when
they
leave
london
i
think
she
will
visit
monkhams
when
the
glascock
people
return
to
england
what
an
episode
in
life
to
go
and
see
the
place
when
it
might
all
now
have
been
hers
i
suppose
i
ought
to
feel
dreadfully
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
marred
such
promotion
said
hugh
nora
is
such
a
singular
girl
so
firm
so
headstrong
so
good
and
so
that
she
will
do
as
well
with
a
poor
man
as
she
would
have
done
with
a
rich
shall
i
confess
to
you
that
i
did
wish
that
she
should
accept
glascock
and
that
i
pressed
it
on
her
very
strongly
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
i
am
only
the
more
proud
of
her
and
of
myself
when
she
was
told
of
all
that
he
had
to
give
in
the
way
of
wealth
and
rank
she
took
the
bit
between
her
teeth
and
would
not
be
turned
an
inch
of
course
she
was
in
love
i
hope
she
may
never
regret
it
that
is
all
she
must
change
her
nature
first
everything
she
sees
at
monkhams
will
make
her
stronger
in
her
choice
with
all
her
girlish
ways
she
is
like
a
rock
nothing
can
move
her
early
on
the
next
morning
hugh
started
alone
for
casalunga
having
first
however
seen
trevelyan
he
took
out
with
him
certain
little
things
for
the
sick
man
table
as
to
which
however
he
was
cautioned
to
say
not
a
word
to
the
sick
man
himself
and
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
endeavour
to
fix
a
day
for
trevelyan
return
to
england
that
was
to
be
the
one
object
in
view
if
we
could
get
him
to
england
she
said
he
and
i
would
at
any
rate
be
together
and
gradually
he
would
be
taught
to
submit
himself
to
advice
before
ten
in
the
morning
stanbury
was
walking
up
the
hill
to
the
house
and
wondering
at
the
dreary
hot
hopeless
desolation
of
the
spot
it
seemed
to
him
that
no
one
could
live
alone
in
such
a
place
in
such
weather
without
being
driven
to
madness
the
soil
was
parched
and
dusty
as
though
no
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
there
for
months
the
lizards
glancing
in
and
out
of
the
broken
walls
added
to
the
appearance
of
heat
the
vegetation
itself
was
of
a
faded
yellowish
green
as
though
the
glare
of
the
sun
had
taken
the
fresh
colour
out
of
it
there
was
a
noise
of
grasshoppers
and
a
hum
of
flies
in
the
air
hardly
audible
but
all
giving
evidence
of
the
heat
not
a
human
voice
was
to
be
heard
nor
the
sound
of
a
human
foot
and
there
was
no
shelter
but
the
sun
blazed
down
full
upon
everything
he
took
off
his
hat
and
rubbed
his
head
with
his
handkerchief
as
he
struck
the
door
with
his
stick
oh
god
to
what
misery
had
a
little
folly
brought
two
human
beings
who
had
had
every
blessing
that
the
world
could
give
within
their
reach
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
conducted
through
the
house
and
found
trevelyan
seated
in
a
chair
under
the
verandah
which
looked
down
upon
the
olive
trees
he
did
not
even
get
up
from
his
seat
but
put
out
his
left
hand
and
welcomed
his
old
friend
stanbury
he
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
for
auld
lang
syne
sake
when
i
found
out
this
retreat
i
did
not
mean
to
have
friends
round
me
here
i
wanted
to
try
what
solitude
was
and
by
heaven
i
tried
it
he
was
dressed
in
a
bright
italian
or
woollen
paletot
italian
as
having
been
bought
in
italy
though
doubtless
it
had
come
from
france
and
on
his
feet
he
had
green
worked
slippers
and
on
his
head
a
brocaded
cap
he
had
made
but
little
other
preparation
for
his
friend
in
the
way
of
dressing
his
long
dishevelled
hair
came
down
over
his
neck
and
his
beard
covered
his
face
beneath
his
he
had
on
a
and
drawers
and
was
as
dirty
in
appearance
as
he
was
gaudy
in
colours
sit
down
and
let
us
two
moralise
he
said
i
spend
my
life
here
doing
nothing
nothing
nothing
while
you
cudgel
your
brain
from
day
to
day
to
mislead
the
british
public
which
of
us
two
is
taking
the
nearest
road
to
the
devil
stanbury
seated
himself
in
a
second
which
there
was
there
in
the
verandah
and
looked
as
carefully
as
he
dared
to
do
at
his
friend
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
to
the
restless
gleam
of
that
eye
and
then
the
affected
air
of
ease
and
the
cynicism
and
the
pretence
of
false
motives
all
told
the
same
story
they
used
to
tell
us
said
stanbury
that
idleness
is
the
root
of
all
evil
they
have
been
telling
us
since
the
world
began
so
many
lies
that
i
for
one
have
determined
never
to
believe
anything
again
labour
leads
to
greed
and
greed
to
selfishness
and
selfishness
to
treachery
and
treachery
straight
to
the
devil
straight
to
the
devil
ha
my
friend
all
your
leading
articles
wo
lead
you
out
of
that
the
news
who
alive
who
dead
who
in
who
out
what
think
you
of
a
man
who
has
not
seen
a
newspaper
for
two
months
and
who
holds
no
conversation
with
the
world
further
than
is
needed
for
the
cooking
of
his
polenta
and
the
cooling
of
his
modest
you
see
your
wife
sometimes
said
stanbury
my
wife
now
my
friend
let
us
drop
that
subject
of
all
topics
of
talk
it
is
the
most
distressing
to
man
in
general
and
i
own
that
i
am
no
exception
to
the
lot
wives
stanbury
are
an
evil
more
or
less
necessary
to
humanity
and
i
own
to
being
one
who
has
not
escaped
the
world
must
be
populated
though
for
what
reason
one
does
not
see
i
have
helped
to
the
extent
of
one
male
bantling
and
if
you
are
one
who
consider
population
desirable
i
will
express
my
regret
that
i
should
have
done
no
more
it
was
very
difficult
to
force
trevelyan
out
of
this
humour
and
it
was
not
till
stanbury
had
risen
apparently
to
take
his
leave
that
he
found
it
possible
to
say
a
word
as
to
his
mission
there
do
you
think
you
would
be
happier
at
home
he
asked
where
is
my
home
sir
knight
of
the
midnight
pen
england
is
your
home
trevelyan
no
sir
england
was
my
home
once
but
i
have
taken
the
liberty
accorded
to
me
by
my
creator
of
choosing
a
new
country
italy
is
now
my
nation
and
casalunga
is
my
home
every
tie
you
have
in
the
world
is
in
england
i
have
no
tie
sir
no
tie
anywhere
it
has
been
my
study
to
untie
all
the
ties
and
by
jove
i
have
succeeded
look
at
me
here
i
have
got
rid
of
the
trammels
pretty
well
have
i
have
unshackled
myself
and
thrown
off
the
paddings
and
the
wrappings
and
the
swaddling
clothes
i
have
got
rid
of
the
conventionalities
and
can
look
nature
straight
in
the
face
i
do
even
want
the
daily
record
stanbury
think
of
that
stanbury
paced
the
length
of
the
terrace
and
then
stopped
for
a
moment
down
under
the
blaze
of
the
sun
in
order
that
he
might
think
how
to
address
this
philosopher
have
you
heard
he
said
at
last
that
i
am
going
to
marry
your
nora
rowley
then
there
will
be
two
more
fools
in
the
world
certainly
and
probably
an
infinity
of
young
fools
coming
afterwards
excuse
me
stanbury
but
this
solitude
is
apt
to
make
one
i
got
sir
marmaduke
sanction
the
day
before
i
left
then
you
got
the
sanction
of
an
illiterate
ignorant
and
most
contemptible
old
man
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
let
him
be
what
he
may
i
was
glad
to
have
it
most
probably
i
shall
never
see
him
again
he
sails
from
southampton
for
the
mandarins
on
this
day
week
he
does
does
he
may
the
devil
sail
along
with
him
that
is
all
i
say
and
does
my
and
sail
with
him
they
all
return
together
except
nora
who
remains
to
comfort
you
i
hope
you
may
be
comforted
that
is
all
do
be
too
particular
let
her
choose
her
own
friends
and
go
her
own
gait
and
have
her
own
way
and
do
you
be
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
and
properly
submissive
and
it
may
be
that
she
give
you
your
breakfast
and
dinner
in
your
own
house
so
long
as
your
hours
interfere
with
her
pleasures
if
she
should
even
urge
you
beside
yourself
by
her
vanity
folly
and
disobedience
so
that
at
last
you
are
driven
to
express
your
feeling
no
doubt
she
will
come
to
you
after
a
while
and
tell
you
with
the
sweetest
condescension
that
she
forgives
you
when
she
has
been
out
of
your
house
for
a
twelvemonth
or
more
she
will
offer
to
come
back
to
you
and
to
forget
everything
on
condition
that
you
will
do
exactly
as
she
bids
you
for
the
future
this
attempt
at
satire
so
fatuous
so
plain
so
false
together
with
the
jaunty
manner
of
the
speaker
who
however
failed
repeatedly
in
his
utterances
from
sheer
physical
exhaustion
was
excessively
painful
to
stanbury
what
can
one
do
at
any
time
with
a
madman
i
mentioned
my
marriage
said
he
to
prove
my
right
to
have
an
additional
interest
in
your
wife
happiness
you
are
quite
welcome
whether
you
marry
the
other
one
or
not
welcome
to
take
any
interest
you
please
i
have
got
beyond
all
that
stanbury
yes
by
jove
a
long
way
beyond
all
that
you
have
not
got
beyond
loving
your
wife
and
your
child
trevelyan
upon
my
word
yes
i
think
i
have
there
may
be
a
grain
of
weakness
left
you
know
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
my
love
for
my
wife
i
was
thinking
more
just
now
of
her
love
for
you
there
she
is
at
siena
you
can
not
mean
that
she
should
remain
there
certainly
not
what
the
deuce
is
there
to
keep
her
there
come
with
her
then
to
england
why
should
i
go
to
england
with
her
because
you
bid
me
or
because
she
wishes
it
or
simply
because
england
is
the
most
damnable
puritanical
and
stupid
country
on
the
face
of
the
globe
i
know
no
other
reason
for
going
to
england
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
stanbury
hugh
declined
the
offer
you
will
excuse
me
continued
trevelyan
i
always
take
a
glass
of
wine
at
this
hour
then
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
helped
himself
from
a
cupboard
that
was
near
at
hand
stanbury
watching
him
as
he
filled
his
glass
could
see
that
his
legs
were
hardly
strong
enough
to
carry
him
and
stanbury
saw
moreover
that
the
unfortunate
man
took
two
glasses
out
of
the
bottle
go
to
england
indeed
i
do
not
think
much
of
this
country
but
it
is
at
any
rate
better
than
england
hugh
perceived
that
he
could
do
nothing
more
on
the
present
occasion
having
heard
so
much
of
trevelyan
debility
he
had
been
astonished
to
hear
the
man
speak
with
so
much
volubility
and
attempts
at
spirit
before
he
had
taken
the
wine
he
had
almost
sunk
into
his
chair
but
still
he
had
continued
to
speak
with
the
same
fluent
cynicism
i
will
come
and
see
you
again
said
hugh
getting
up
to
take
his
departure
you
might
as
well
save
your
trouble
stanbury
but
you
can
come
if
you
please
you
know
if
you
should
find
yourself
locked
out
you
wo
be
angry
a
hermit
such
as
i
am
must
assume
privileges
i
wo
be
angry
said
hugh
good
humouredly
i
can
smell
what
you
are
come
about
said
trevelyan
you
and
my
wife
want
to
take
me
away
from
here
among
you
and
i
think
it
best
to
stay
here
i
do
want
much
for
myself
and
why
should
i
not
live
here
my
wife
can
remain
at
siena
if
she
pleases
or
she
can
go
to
england
if
she
pleases
she
must
give
me
the
same
liberty
the
same
liberty
the
same
liberty
after
this
he
fell
violently
and
stanbury
thought
it
better
to
leave
him
he
had
been
at
casalunga
about
two
hours
and
did
not
seem
as
yet
to
have
done
any
good
he
had
been
astonished
both
by
trevelyan
weakness
and
by
his
strength
by
his
folly
and
by
his
sharpness
hitherto
he
could
see
no
way
for
his
future
out
of
her
troubles
when
he
was
with
her
at
siena
he
described
what
had
taken
place
with
all
the
accuracy
in
his
power
he
has
intermittent
days
said
emily
he
will
be
in
quite
another
frame
of
mind
melancholy
silent
perhaps
and
we
will
both
go
and
we
shall
find
probably
that
he
has
forgotten
altogether
what
has
passed
between
you
and
him
so
their
plans
for
the
morrow
were
formed
chapter
xciii
say
that
you
forgive
me
illustration
on
the
following
day
again
early
in
the
morning
trevelyan
and
stanbury
were
driven
out
to
casalunga
the
country
people
along
the
road
knew
the
carriage
well
and
the
lady
who
occupied
it
and
would
say
that
the
english
wife
was
going
to
see
her
mad
husband
trevelyan
knew
that
these
words
were
common
in
the
people
mouths
and
explained
to
her
companion
how
necessary
it
would
be
to
use
these
rumours
to
aid
her
in
putting
some
restraint
over
her
husband
even
in
this
country
should
they
fail
in
their
effort
to
take
him
to
england
she
saw
the
doctor
in
siena
constantly
and
had
learned
from
him
how
such
steps
might
be
taken
the
measure
proposed
would
be
slow
difficult
inefficient
and
very
hard
to
set
aside
if
once
taken
but
still
it
might
be
indispensable
that
something
should
be
done
he
would
be
so
much
worse
off
here
than
he
would
be
at
home
she
said
if
we
could
only
make
him
understand
that
it
would
be
so
then
stanbury
asked
about
the
wine
it
seemed
that
of
late
trevelyan
had
taken
to
drink
freely
but
only
of
the
wine
of
the
country
but
the
wine
of
the
country
in
these
parts
is
sufficiently
stimulating
and
trevelyan
acknowledged
that
hence
had
arisen
a
further
cause
of
fear
they
walked
up
the
hill
together
and
trevelyan
now
well
knowing
the
ways
of
the
place
went
round
at
once
to
the
front
terrace
there
he
was
seated
in
his
dressed
in
the
same
way
as
yesterday
dirty
dishevelled
and
gaudy
with
various
colours
but
stanbury
could
see
at
once
that
his
mood
had
greatly
changed
he
rose
slowly
dragging
himself
up
out
of
his
chair
as
they
came
up
to
him
but
shewing
as
he
did
so
and
perhaps
somewhat
assuming
the
impotency
of
querulous
sickness
his
wife
went
to
him
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
placed
him
back
in
his
chair
he
was
weak
he
said
and
had
not
slept
and
suffered
from
the
heat
and
then
he
begged
her
to
give
him
wine
this
she
did
half
filling
for
him
a
tumbler
of
which
he
swallowed
the
contents
greedily
you
see
me
very
poorly
stanbury
very
poorly
he
said
seeming
to
ignore
all
that
had
taken
place
on
the
previous
day
you
want
change
of
climate
old
fellow
said
stanbury
change
of
everything
i
want
change
of
everything
he
said
if
i
could
have
a
new
body
and
a
new
mind
and
a
new
soul
the
mind
and
soul
dear
will
do
well
enough
if
you
will
let
us
look
after
the
body
said
his
wife
seating
herself
on
a
stool
near
his
feet
stanbury
who
had
settled
beforehand
how
he
would
conduct
himself
took
out
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
and
then
they
sat
together
silent
or
nearly
silent
for
half
an
hour
she
had
said
that
if
hugh
would
do
so
trevelyan
would
soon
become
used
to
the
presence
of
his
old
friend
and
it
seemed
that
he
had
already
done
so
more
than
once
when
he
coughed
his
wife
fetched
him
some
drink
in
a
cup
which
he
took
from
her
without
a
word
and
stanbury
the
while
went
on
smoking
in
silence
you
have
heard
louis
she
said
at
last
that
after
all
nora
and
stanbury
are
going
to
be
married
ah
yes
i
think
i
was
told
of
it
i
hope
you
may
be
happy
stanbury
happier
than
i
have
been
this
was
unfortunate
but
neither
of
the
visitors
winced
or
said
a
word
it
will
be
a
pity
that
papa
and
mamma
can
not
be
present
at
the
wedding
said
trevelyan
if
i
had
to
do
it
again
i
should
not
regret
your
father
absence
i
must
say
that
he
has
been
my
enemy
yes
stanbury
my
enemy
i
do
care
who
hears
me
say
so
i
am
obliged
to
stay
here
because
that
man
would
swear
every
shilling
i
have
away
from
me
if
i
were
in
england
he
would
strive
to
do
so
and
the
struggle
in
my
state
of
health
would
be
too
much
for
me
but
sir
marmaduke
sails
from
southampton
this
very
week
said
stanbury
i
do
know
he
is
always
sailing
and
always
coming
back
again
i
never
asked
him
for
a
shilling
in
my
life
and
yet
he
has
treated
me
as
though
i
were
his
bitterest
enemy
he
will
trouble
you
no
more
now
louis
said
trevelyan
he
can
not
trouble
you
again
he
will
have
left
england
before
you
can
possibly
reach
it
he
will
have
left
other
traitors
behind
him
though
none
as
bad
as
himself
said
trevelyan
stanbury
when
his
cigar
was
finished
rose
and
left
the
husband
and
wife
together
on
the
terrace
there
was
little
enough
to
be
seen
at
casalunga
but
he
strolled
about
looking
at
the
place
he
went
into
the
huge
granary
and
then
down
among
the
olive
trees
and
up
into
the
sheds
which
had
been
built
for
beasts
he
stood
and
teased
the
lizards
and
listened
to
the
hum
of
the
insects
and
wiped
away
the
perspiration
which
rose
to
his
brow
even
as
he
was
standing
and
all
the
while
he
was
thinking
what
he
would
do
next
or
what
say
next
with
the
view
of
getting
trevelyan
away
from
the
place
hitherto
he
had
been
very
tender
with
him
contradicting
him
in
nothing
taking
from
him
good
humouredly
any
absurd
insult
which
he
chose
to
offer
pressing
upon
him
none
of
the
evil
which
he
had
himself
occasioned
saying
to
him
no
word
that
could
hurt
either
his
pride
or
his
comfort
but
he
could
not
see
that
this
would
be
efficacious
for
the
purpose
desired
he
had
come
thither
to
help
nora
sister
in
her
terrible
distress
and
he
must
take
upon
himself
to
make
some
plan
for
giving
this
aid
when
he
had
thought
of
all
this
and
made
his
plan
he
sauntered
back
round
the
house
on
to
the
terrace
she
was
still
there
sitting
at
her
husband
feet
and
holding
one
of
his
hands
in
hers
it
was
well
that
the
wife
should
be
tender
but
he
doubted
whether
tenderness
would
suffice
trevelyan
he
said
you
know
why
i
have
come
over
here
i
suppose
she
told
you
to
come
said
trevelyan
well
yes
she
did
tell
me
i
came
to
try
and
get
you
back
to
england
if
you
remain
here
the
climate
and
solitude
together
will
kill
you
as
for
the
climate
i
like
it
and
as
for
solitude
i
have
got
used
even
to
that
and
then
there
is
another
thing
said
stanbury
what
is
that
asked
trevelyan
starting
you
are
not
safe
here
how
not
safe
she
could
not
tell
you
but
i
must
his
wife
was
still
holding
his
hand
and
he
did
not
at
once
attempt
to
withdraw
it
but
he
raised
himself
in
his
chair
and
fixed
his
eyes
fiercely
on
stanbury
they
will
not
let
you
remain
here
quietly
said
stanbury
who
will
not
the
italians
they
are
already
saying
that
you
are
not
fit
to
be
alone
and
if
once
they
get
you
into
their
hands
under
some
italian
medical
board
perhaps
into
some
italian
asylum
it
might
be
years
before
you
could
get
out
if
ever
i
have
come
to
tell
you
what
the
danger
is
i
do
not
know
whether
you
will
believe
me
is
it
so
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
i
believe
it
is
louis
and
who
has
told
them
who
has
been
putting
them
up
to
it
now
his
hand
had
been
withdrawn
my
god
am
i
to
be
followed
here
too
with
such
persecution
as
this
nobody
has
told
them
but
people
have
eyes
liar
traitor
fiend
it
is
you
he
said
turning
upon
his
wife
louis
as
i
hope
for
mercy
i
have
said
not
a
word
to
any
one
that
could
injure
you
trevelyan
do
not
be
so
unjust
and
so
foolish
said
stanbury
it
is
not
her
doing
do
you
suppose
that
you
can
live
here
like
this
and
give
rise
to
no
remarks
do
you
think
that
people
eyes
are
not
open
and
that
their
tongues
will
not
speak
i
tell
you
you
are
in
danger
here
what
am
i
to
do
where
am
i
to
go
can
not
they
let
me
stay
till
i
die
whom
am
i
hurting
here
she
may
have
all
my
money
if
she
wants
it
she
has
got
my
child
i
want
nothing
louis
but
to
take
you
where
you
may
be
safe
and
well
why
are
you
afraid
of
going
to
england
stanbury
asked
because
they
have
threatened
to
put
me
in
a
madhouse
nobody
ever
thought
of
so
treating
you
said
his
wife
your
father
did
and
your
mother
they
told
me
so
look
here
trevelyan
sir
marmaduke
and
lady
rowley
are
gone
they
will
have
sailed
at
least
before
we
can
reach
england
whatever
may
have
been
either
their
wishes
or
their
power
they
can
do
nothing
now
here
something
would
be
done
very
soon
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
if
you
will
return
with
me
and
your
wife
you
shall
choose
your
own
place
of
abode
is
not
that
so
emily
he
shall
choose
everything
his
boy
will
be
with
him
and
i
will
be
with
him
and
he
shall
be
contradicted
in
nothing
if
he
only
knew
my
heart
towards
him
you
hear
what
she
says
trevelyan
yes
i
hear
her
and
you
believe
her
i
not
so
sure
of
that
stanbury
how
should
you
like
to
be
locked
up
in
a
madhouse
and
grin
through
the
bars
till
your
heart
was
broken
it
would
not
take
long
with
me
i
know
you
shall
never
be
locked
up
never
be
touched
said
his
wife
i
am
very
harmless
here
he
said
almost
crying
very
harmless
i
do
not
think
anybody
here
will
touch
me
he
added
afterwards
and
there
are
other
places
there
are
other
places
my
god
that
i
should
be
driven
about
the
world
like
this
the
conference
was
ended
by
his
saying
that
he
would
take
two
days
to
think
of
it
and
by
his
then
desiring
that
they
would
both
leave
him
they
did
so
and
descended
the
hill
together
knowing
that
he
was
watching
them
that
he
would
watch
them
till
they
were
out
of
sight
from
the
gate
for
as
trevelyan
said
he
never
came
down
the
hill
now
knowing
that
the
labour
of
ascending
it
was
too
much
for
him
when
they
were
at
the
carriage
they
were
met
by
one
of
the
women
of
the
house
and
strict
injunctions
were
given
to
her
by
trevelyan
to
send
on
word
to
siena
if
the
signore
should
prepare
to
move
he
can
not
go
far
without
my
knowing
it
said
she
because
he
draws
his
money
in
siena
and
lately
i
have
taken
to
him
what
he
wants
he
has
not
enough
with
him
for
a
long
journey
for
stanbury
had
suggested
that
he
might
be
off
to
seek
another
residence
in
another
country
and
that
they
would
find
casalunga
vacant
when
they
reached
it
on
the
following
tuesday
but
he
told
himself
almost
immediately
not
caring
to
express
such
an
opinion
to
emily
that
trevelyan
would
hardly
have
strength
even
to
prepare
for
such
a
journey
by
himself
on
the
intervening
day
the
monday
stanbury
had
no
occupation
whatever
and
he
thought
that
since
he
was
born
no
day
had
ever
been
so
long
siena
contains
many
monuments
of
interest
and
much
that
is
valuable
in
art
having
had
a
school
of
painting
of
its
own
and
still
retaining
in
its
public
gallery
specimens
of
its
school
of
which
as
a
city
it
is
justly
proud
there
are
palaces
there
to
be
beaten
for
gloomy
majesty
by
none
in
italy
there
is
a
cathedral
which
was
to
have
been
the
largest
in
the
world
and
than
which
few
are
more
worthy
of
prolonged
inspection
the
town
is
old
and
quaint
and
picturesque
and
dirty
and
attractive
as
it
becomes
a
town
in
italy
to
be
but
in
july
all
such
charms
are
thrown
away
in
july
italy
is
not
a
land
of
charms
to
an
englishman
poor
stanbury
did
wander
into
the
cathedral
and
finding
it
the
coolest
place
in
the
town
went
to
sleep
on
a
stone
step
he
was
awoke
by
the
voice
of
the
priests
as
they
began
to
chant
the
vespers
the
italians
had
let
him
sleep
and
would
have
let
him
sleep
till
the
doors
were
closed
for
the
night
at
five
he
dined
with
trevelyan
and
then
endeavoured
to
while
away
the
evening
thinking
of
nora
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
he
was
standing
in
this
way
at
the
hotel
gateway
when
on
a
sudden
all
siena
was
made
alive
by
the
clatter
of
an
open
carriage
and
four
on
its
way
through
the
town
to
the
railway
on
looking
up
stanbury
saw
lord
peterborough
in
the
carriage
with
a
lady
whom
he
did
not
doubt
to
be
lord
peterborough
wife
he
himself
had
not
been
recognised
but
he
slowly
followed
the
carriage
to
the
railway
station
after
the
italian
fashion
the
arrival
was
of
an
hour
before
the
proper
time
and
stanbury
had
full
opportunity
of
learning
their
news
and
telling
his
own
they
were
coming
up
from
rome
and
thought
it
preferable
to
take
the
route
by
siena
than
to
use
the
railway
through
the
maremma
and
they
intended
to
reach
florence
that
night
and
do
you
think
he
is
really
mad
asked
lady
peterborough
he
is
undoubtedly
so
mad
as
to
be
unfit
to
manage
anything
for
himself
but
he
is
not
in
such
a
condition
that
any
one
would
wish
to
see
him
put
into
confinement
if
he
were
raving
mad
there
would
be
less
difficulty
though
there
might
be
more
distress
a
great
deal
was
said
about
nora
and
both
lord
peterborough
and
his
wife
insisted
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
at
monkhams
we
shall
be
home
now
in
less
than
three
weeks
said
caroline
and
she
must
come
to
us
at
once
but
i
will
write
to
her
from
florence
and
tell
her
how
we
saw
you
smoking
your
pipe
under
the
archway
not
that
my
husband
knew
you
in
the
least
upon
my
word
no
said
the
husband
one
did
expect
to
find
you
here
i
hope
you
may
succeed
in
getting
him
home
i
went
to
him
once
but
could
do
very
little
then
the
train
started
and
stanbury
went
back
to
trevelyan
on
the
next
day
stanbury
went
out
to
casalunga
alone
he
had
calculated
on
leaving
england
that
if
any
good
might
be
done
at
siena
it
could
be
done
in
three
days
and
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
start
on
his
return
on
the
wednesday
morning
or
on
wednesday
evening
at
the
latest
but
now
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
chance
of
that
and
he
hardly
knew
how
to
guess
when
he
might
get
away
he
had
sent
a
telegram
to
lady
rowley
after
his
first
visit
in
which
he
had
simply
said
that
things
were
not
at
all
changed
at
casalunga
and
he
had
written
to
nora
each
day
since
his
arrival
his
stay
was
prolonged
at
great
expense
and
inconvenience
to
himself
and
yet
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
go
and
leave
his
work
half
finished
as
he
walked
up
the
hill
to
the
house
he
felt
very
angry
with
trevelyan
and
prepared
himself
to
use
hard
words
and
dreadful
threats
but
at
the
very
moment
of
his
entrance
on
the
terrace
trevelyan
professed
himself
ready
to
go
to
england
that
right
old
fellow
said
hugh
i
am
so
glad
but
in
expressing
his
joy
he
had
hardly
noticed
trevelyan
voice
and
appearance
i
might
as
well
go
he
said
it
matters
little
where
i
am
or
whether
they
say
that
i
am
mad
or
sane
when
we
have
you
over
there
nobody
shall
say
a
word
that
is
disagreeable
i
only
hope
that
you
may
not
have
the
trouble
of
burying
me
on
the
road
you
do
know
stanbury
how
ill
i
am
i
can
not
eat
if
i
were
at
the
bottom
of
that
hill
i
could
no
more
walk
up
it
than
i
could
fly
i
can
not
sleep
and
at
night
my
bed
is
wet
through
with
perspiration
i
can
remember
nothing
nothing
but
what
i
ought
to
forget
we
put
you
on
to
your
legs
again
when
we
get
you
to
your
own
climate
i
shall
be
a
poor
traveller
a
poor
traveller
but
i
will
do
my
best
when
would
he
start
that
was
the
next
question
trevelyan
asked
for
a
week
and
stanbury
brought
him
down
at
last
to
three
days
they
would
go
to
florence
by
the
evening
train
on
friday
and
sleep
there
emily
should
come
out
and
assist
him
to
arrange
his
things
on
the
morrow
having
finished
so
much
of
his
business
stanbury
returned
to
siena
they
both
feared
that
he
might
be
found
on
the
next
day
to
have
departed
from
his
intention
but
no
such
idea
seemed
to
have
occurred
to
him
he
gave
instructions
as
to
the
notice
to
be
served
on
the
agent
from
the
hospital
as
to
his
house
and
allowed
emily
to
go
among
his
things
and
make
preparations
for
the
journey
he
did
not
say
much
to
her
and
when
she
attempted
with
a
soft
word
to
assure
him
that
the
threat
of
italian
interference
which
had
come
from
stanbury
had
not
reached
stanbury
from
her
he
simply
shook
his
head
sadly
she
could
not
understand
whether
he
did
not
believe
her
or
whether
he
simply
wished
that
the
subject
should
be
dropped
she
could
elicit
no
sign
of
affection
from
him
nor
would
he
willingly
accept
such
from
her
but
he
allowed
her
to
prepare
for
the
journey
and
never
hinted
that
his
purpose
might
again
be
liable
to
change
on
the
friday
emily
with
her
child
and
hugh
with
all
their
baggage
travelled
out
on
the
road
to
casalunga
thinking
it
better
that
there
should
be
no
halt
in
the
town
on
their
return
at
casalunga
hugh
went
up
the
hill
with
the
driver
leaving
trevelyan
in
the
carriage
he
had
been
out
at
the
house
before
in
the
morning
and
had
given
all
necessary
orders
but
still
at
the
last
moment
he
thought
that
there
might
be
failure
but
trevelyan
was
ready
having
dressed
himself
up
with
a
laced
shirt
and
changed
his
for
a
blue
and
his
brocaded
cap
for
a
paris
hat
very
pointed
before
and
behind
and
closely
turned
up
at
the
sides
but
stanbury
did
not
in
the
least
care
for
his
friend
dress
take
my
arm
he
said
and
we
will
go
down
fair
and
easy
emily
would
not
come
up
because
of
the
heat
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
or
almost
carried
down
the
hill
and
three
women
and
the
coachman
and
an
old
countryman
who
worked
on
the
farm
followed
with
the
luggage
it
took
about
an
hour
and
a
half
to
pack
the
things
but
at
last
they
were
all
packed
and
corded
and
bound
together
with
sticks
as
though
it
were
intended
that
they
should
travel
in
that
form
to
moscow
trevelyan
the
meanwhile
sat
on
a
chair
which
had
been
brought
out
for
him
from
one
of
the
cottages
and
his
wife
stood
beside
him
with
her
boy
now
then
we
are
ready
said
stanbury
and
in
that
way
they
bade
farewell
to
casalunga
trevelyan
sat
speechless
in
the
carriage
and
would
not
even
notice
the
child
he
seemed
to
be
half
dreaming
and
to
fix
his
eyes
on
vacancy
he
appears
to
think
of
nothing
now
emily
said
that
evening
to
stanbury
but
who
can
tell
how
busy
and
how
troubled
are
the
thoughts
of
a
madman
they
had
now
succeeded
in
their
object
of
inducing
their
patient
to
return
with
them
to
england
but
what
were
they
to
do
with
him
when
they
had
reached
home
with
him
they
rested
only
a
night
at
florence
but
they
found
their
so
weary
that
they
were
unable
to
get
beyond
bologna
on
the
second
day
many
questions
were
asked
of
him
as
to
where
he
himself
would
wish
to
take
up
his
residence
in
england
but
it
was
found
almost
impossible
to
get
an
answer
once
he
suggested
that
he
would
like
to
go
back
to
fuller
cottage
at
willesden
from
whence
they
concluded
that
he
would
wish
to
live
somewhere
out
of
london
on
his
first
day
journey
he
was
moody
and
silent
wilfully
assuming
the
airs
of
a
person
he
spoke
hardly
at
all
and
would
notice
nothing
that
was
said
to
him
by
his
wife
he
declared
once
that
he
regarded
stanbury
as
his
keeper
and
endeavoured
to
be
disagreeable
and
sullenly
combative
but
on
the
second
day
he
was
too
weak
for
this
and
accepted
without
remonstrance
the
attentions
that
were
paid
to
him
at
bologna
they
rested
a
day
and
from
thence
both
stanbury
and
trevelyan
wrote
to
nora
they
did
not
know
where
she
might
be
now
staying
but
the
letters
by
agreement
were
addressed
to
gregg
hotel
it
was
suggested
that
lodgings
or
if
possible
a
small
furnished
house
should
be
taken
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mortlake
richmond
or
teddington
and
that
a
telegram
as
well
as
a
letter
should
be
sent
to
them
at
the
paris
hotel
as
they
could
not
travel
quick
there
might
be
time
enough
for
them
in
this
way
to
know
whither
they
should
go
on
their
reaching
london
they
stayed
a
day
at
bologna
and
then
they
went
on
again
to
turin
over
the
mountains
to
chambery
thence
to
dijon
and
on
to
paris
at
chambery
they
remained
a
couple
of
days
fancying
that
the
air
there
was
cool
and
that
the
delay
would
be
salutary
to
the
sick
man
at
turin
finding
that
they
wanted
further
assistance
they
had
hired
a
courier
and
at
last
trevelyan
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
in
and
out
of
the
carriages
and
up
and
down
the
hotel
stairs
almost
as
though
he
were
a
child
the
delay
was
terribly
grievous
to
stanbury
and
trevelyan
perceiving
this
more
than
once
begged
him
to
leave
them
and
to
allow
her
to
finish
the
journey
with
the
aid
of
the
courier
but
this
he
could
not
do
he
wrote
letters
to
his
friends
at
the
office
explaining
his
position
as
well
as
he
could
and
suggesting
that
this
and
that
able
assistant
should
enlighten
the
british
people
on
this
and
that
subject
which
would
in
the
course
of
nature
as
arranged
at
the
office
have
fallen
into
his
hands
he
and
trevelyan
became
as
brother
and
sister
to
each
other
on
their
way
home
as
indeed
it
was
natural
that
they
should
do
were
they
doing
right
or
wrong
in
this
journey
that
they
were
taking
they
could
not
conceal
from
themselves
that
the
labour
was
almost
more
than
the
poor
wretch
could
endure
and
that
it
might
be
as
he
himself
had
suggested
that
they
would
be
called
on
to
bury
him
on
the
road
but
that
residence
at
casalunga
had
been
so
terrible
the
circumstances
of
it
including
the
solitude
sickness
madness
and
habits
of
life
of
the
wretched
hermit
had
been
so
dangerous
the
probability
of
interference
on
the
part
of
some
native
authority
so
great
and
the
chance
of
the
house
being
left
in
trevelyan
possession
so
small
that
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
no
other
alternative
and
yet
how
would
it
be
if
they
were
killing
him
by
the
toil
of
travelling
from
chambery
they
made
the
journey
to
paris
in
two
days
and
during
that
time
trevelyan
hardly
opened
his
mouth
he
slept
much
and
ate
better
than
he
had
done
in
the
hotter
climate
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
they
found
a
telegram
at
paris
which
simply
contained
the
promise
of
a
letter
for
the
next
day
it
had
been
sent
by
nora
before
she
had
gone
out
on
her
search
but
it
contained
one
morsel
of
strange
information
lady
milborough
is
going
with
me
on
the
next
day
they
got
a
letter
saying
that
a
cottage
had
been
taken
furnished
between
richmond
and
twickenham
lady
milborough
had
known
of
the
cottage
and
everything
would
be
ready
then
nora
would
herself
meet
them
at
the
station
in
london
if
they
would
as
she
proposed
stay
a
night
at
dover
they
were
to
address
to
her
at
lady
house
in
eccleston
square
in
that
case
she
would
have
a
carriage
for
them
at
the
victoria
station
and
would
go
down
with
them
at
once
to
the
cottage
there
were
to
be
two
days
more
of
weary
travelling
and
then
they
were
to
be
at
home
again
she
and
he
would
have
a
house
together
as
husband
and
wife
and
the
curse
of
their
separation
would
at
any
rate
be
over
her
mind
towards
him
had
changed
altogether
since
the
days
in
which
she
had
been
so
indignant
because
he
had
set
a
policeman
to
watch
over
her
all
feeling
of
anger
was
over
with
her
now
there
is
nothing
that
a
woman
will
not
forgive
a
man
when
he
is
weaker
than
she
is
herself
the
journey
was
made
first
to
dover
and
then
to
london
once
as
they
were
making
their
way
through
the
kentish
he
put
out
his
hand
feebly
and
touched
hers
they
had
the
carriage
to
themselves
and
she
was
down
on
her
knees
before
him
instantly
oh
louis
oh
louis
say
that
you
forgive
me
what
could
a
woman
do
more
than
that
in
her
mercy
to
a
man
yes
yes
yes
he
said
but
do
not
talk
now
i
am
so
tired
chapter
xciv
a
real
christian
in
the
meantime
the
rowleys
were
gone
on
the
monday
after
the
departure
of
stanbury
for
italy
lady
rowley
had
begun
to
look
the
difficulty
about
nora
in
the
face
and
to
feel
that
she
must
do
something
towards
providing
the
poor
girl
with
a
temporary
home
everybody
had
now
agreed
that
she
was
to
marry
hugh
stanbury
as
soon
as
hugh
stanbury
could
be
ready
and
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
that
she
should
be
left
out
in
the
world
as
one
in
disgrace
or
under
a
cloud
but
what
was
to
be
done
sir
marmaduke
was
quite
incapable
of
suggesting
anything
he
would
make
her
an
allowance
and
leave
her
a
small
sum
of
ready
money
but
as
to
residence
he
could
only
suggest
again
and
again
that
she
should
be
sent
to
outhouse
now
lady
rowley
was
herself
not
very
fond
of
outhouse
and
she
was
aware
that
nora
herself
was
almost
as
averse
to
diddulph
as
she
was
to
the
mandarins
nora
already
knew
that
she
had
the
game
in
her
own
hands
once
when
in
her
presence
her
father
suggested
the
near
relationship
and
prudent
character
and
intense
respectability
of
outhouse
nora
who
was
sitting
behind
sir
marmaduke
shook
her
head
at
her
mother
and
lady
rowley
knew
that
nora
would
not
go
to
diddulph
this
was
the
last
occasion
on
which
that
proposition
was
discussed
throughout
all
the
trevelyan
troubles
lady
milborough
had
continued
to
shew
a
friendly
anxiety
on
behalf
of
emily
trevelyan
she
had
called
once
or
twice
on
lady
rowley
and
lady
rowley
had
of
course
returned
the
visits
she
had
been
forward
in
expressing
her
belief
that
in
truth
the
wife
had
been
but
little
if
at
all
to
blame
and
had
won
her
way
with
lady
rowley
though
she
had
never
been
a
favourite
with
either
of
lady
rowley
daughters
now
in
her
difficulty
lady
rowley
went
to
lady
milborough
and
returned
with
an
invitation
that
nora
should
come
to
eccleston
square
either
till
such
time
as
she
might
think
fit
to
go
to
monkhams
or
till
trevelyan
should
have
returned
and
should
be
desirous
of
having
her
sister
with
her
when
nora
first
heard
of
this
she
almost
screamed
with
surprise
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
with
disappointment
also
she
never
liked
me
mamma
then
she
is
so
much
more
but
i
do
want
to
go
to
her
merely
because
she
is
enough
to
receive
a
person
she
dislikes
i
know
she
is
very
good
i
know
she
would
sacrifice
herself
for
anything
she
thought
right
but
mamma
she
is
such
a
bore
but
lady
rowley
would
not
be
talked
down
even
by
nora
in
this
fashion
nora
was
somewhat
touched
with
an
idea
that
it
would
be
a
fine
independent
thing
to
live
alone
if
it
were
only
for
a
week
or
two
just
because
other
young
ladies
never
lived
alone
perhaps
there
was
some
notion
in
her
mind
that
permission
to
do
so
was
part
of
the
reward
due
to
her
for
having
refused
to
marry
a
lord
stanbury
was
in
some
respects
a
bohemian
and
it
would
become
her
she
thought
to
have
a
little
practice
herself
in
the
bohemian
line
she
had
indeed
declined
a
bohemian
marriage
feeling
strongly
averse
to
encounter
the
loud
displeasure
of
her
father
and
mother
but
as
long
as
everything
was
quite
proper
as
long
as
there
should
be
no
running
away
or
subjection
of
her
name
to
scandal
she
considered
that
a
little
independence
would
be
useful
and
agreeable
she
had
looked
forward
to
sitting
up
at
night
alone
by
a
single
tallow
candle
to
stretching
a
beefsteak
so
as
to
last
her
for
two
days
dinners
and
perhaps
to
making
her
own
bed
now
there
would
not
be
the
slightest
touch
of
romance
in
a
visit
to
lady
house
in
eccleston
square
at
the
end
of
july
lady
rowley
however
was
of
a
different
opinion
and
spoke
her
mind
plainly
nora
my
dear
do
be
a
fool
a
young
lady
like
you
ca
go
and
live
in
lodgings
by
herself
all
manner
of
things
would
be
said
and
this
is
such
a
very
kind
offer
you
must
accept
it
for
hugh
sake
i
have
already
said
that
you
would
accept
it
but
she
will
be
going
out
of
town
she
will
stay
till
you
can
go
to
monkhams
if
emily
is
not
back
before
then
she
knows
all
about
emily
affairs
and
if
she
does
come
back
which
i
doubt
poor
thing
lady
milborough
and
you
will
be
able
to
judge
whether
you
should
go
to
her
so
it
was
settled
and
nora
bohemian
castle
in
the
air
fell
into
shatters
the
few
remaining
days
before
the
departure
to
southampton
passed
quickly
but
yet
sadly
sir
marmaduke
had
come
to
england
expecting
pleasure
and
with
that
undefined
idea
which
men
so
employed
always
have
on
their
return
home
that
something
will
turn
up
which
will
make
their
going
back
to
that
same
banishment
unnecessary
what
governor
of
what
minister
to
bogota
what
general
of
the
forces
at
the
gold
coast
ever
left
the
scene
of
his
official
or
military
labours
without
a
hope
which
was
almost
an
expectation
that
a
grateful
country
would
do
something
better
for
him
before
the
period
of
his
return
should
have
arrived
but
a
grateful
country
was
doing
nothing
better
for
sir
marmaduke
and
an
ungrateful
secretary
of
state
at
the
colonial
office
would
not
extend
the
term
during
which
he
could
regard
himself
as
absent
on
special
service
how
thankful
he
had
been
when
first
the
tidings
reached
him
that
he
was
to
come
home
at
the
expense
of
the
crown
and
without
diminution
of
his
official
income
he
had
now
been
in
england
for
five
months
with
a
per
diem
allowance
with
his
very
cabs
paid
for
him
and
he
was
discontented
sullen
and
with
nothing
to
comfort
him
but
his
official
grievance
because
he
could
not
be
allowed
to
extend
his
period
of
special
service
more
than
two
months
beyond
the
time
at
which
those
special
services
were
in
truth
ended
there
had
been
a
change
of
ministry
in
the
last
month
and
he
had
thought
that
a
conservative
secretary
of
state
would
have
been
kinder
to
him
the
duke
says
i
can
stay
three
months
with
leave
of
absence
and
have
half
my
pay
stopped
i
wonder
whether
it
ever
enters
into
his
august
mind
that
even
a
colonial
governor
must
eat
and
drink
it
was
thus
he
expressed
his
great
grievance
to
his
wife
the
duke
however
had
been
as
inexorable
as
his
predecessor
and
sir
rowley
with
his
large
family
was
too
wise
to
remain
to
the
detriment
of
his
pocket
in
the
meantime
the
clerks
in
the
office
who
had
groaned
in
spirit
over
the
ignorance
displayed
in
his
evidence
before
the
committee
were
whispering
among
themselves
that
he
ought
not
to
be
sent
back
to
his
seat
of
government
at
all
lady
rowley
also
was
disappointed
and
unhappy
she
had
expected
so
much
pleasure
from
her
visit
to
her
daughter
and
she
had
received
so
little
emily
condition
was
very
sad
but
in
her
heart
of
hearts
perhaps
she
groaned
more
bitterly
over
all
that
nora
had
lost
than
she
did
over
the
real
sorrows
of
her
elder
child
to
have
had
the
cup
at
her
lip
and
then
not
to
have
tasted
it
and
she
had
the
solace
of
no
communion
in
this
sorrow
she
had
accepted
hugh
stanbury
as
her
and
not
for
worlds
would
she
now
say
a
word
against
him
to
any
one
she
had
already
taken
him
to
her
heart
and
she
loved
him
but
to
have
had
it
almost
within
her
grasp
to
have
had
a
lord
the
owner
of
monkhams
for
her
poor
lady
rowley
sophie
and
lucy
too
were
returning
to
their
distant
and
dull
banishment
without
any
realisation
of
their
probable
but
unexpressed
ambition
they
made
no
complaint
but
yet
it
was
hard
on
them
that
their
sister
misfortune
should
have
prevented
them
from
going
almost
to
a
single
dance
poor
sophie
and
poor
lucy
they
must
go
and
we
shall
hear
no
more
about
them
it
was
thought
well
that
nora
should
not
go
down
with
them
to
southampton
what
good
would
her
going
do
god
bless
you
my
darling
said
the
mother
as
she
held
her
child
in
her
arms
dear
mamma
give
my
best
love
to
hugh
and
tell
him
that
i
pray
him
with
my
last
word
to
be
good
to
you
even
then
she
was
thinking
of
lord
peterborough
but
the
memory
of
what
might
have
been
was
buried
deep
in
her
mind
nora
tell
me
all
about
it
said
lucy
there
will
be
nothing
to
tell
said
nora
tell
it
all
the
same
said
lucy
and
bring
hugh
out
to
write
a
book
of
travels
about
the
mandarins
nobody
has
ever
written
a
book
about
the
mandarins
so
they
parted
and
when
sir
marmaduke
and
his
party
were
taken
off
in
two
cabs
to
the
waterloo
station
nora
was
taken
in
one
cab
to
eccleston
square
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
old
lady
since
the
world
began
ever
did
a
more
thoroughly
christian
and
friendly
act
than
this
which
was
now
being
done
by
lady
milborough
it
was
the
end
of
july
and
she
would
already
have
been
down
in
dorsetshire
but
for
her
devotion
to
this
good
deed
for
in
truth
what
she
was
doing
was
not
occasioned
by
any
express
love
for
nora
rowley
nora
rowley
was
all
very
well
but
nora
rowley
towards
her
had
been
flippant
impatient
and
indeed
not
always
so
civil
as
a
young
lady
should
be
to
the
elderly
friends
of
her
married
sister
but
to
lady
milborough
it
had
seemed
to
be
quite
terrible
that
a
young
girl
should
be
left
alone
in
the
world
without
anybody
to
take
care
of
her
young
ladies
according
to
her
views
of
life
were
fragile
plants
that
wanted
much
nursing
before
they
could
be
allowed
to
be
planted
out
in
the
gardens
of
the
world
as
married
women
when
she
heard
from
lady
rowley
that
nora
was
engaged
to
marry
hugh
stanbury
you
know
all
about
lord
peterborough
lady
milborough
but
it
is
no
use
going
back
to
that
now
is
it
and
stanbury
has
behaved
so
exceedingly
well
in
regard
to
poor
louis
when
lady
milborough
heard
this
and
heard
also
that
nora
was
talking
of
going
to
live
by
herself
in
lodgings
she
swore
to
herself
like
a
goodly
christian
woman
as
she
was
that
such
a
thing
must
not
be
eccleston
square
in
july
and
august
is
not
pleasant
unless
it
be
to
an
inhabitant
who
is
interested
in
the
of
the
parliamentary
session
lady
milborough
had
no
interest
in
politics
had
not
much
interest
even
in
seeing
the
social
season
out
to
its
dregs
she
ordinarily
remained
in
london
till
the
beginning
or
middle
of
july
because
the
people
with
whom
she
lived
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
but
as
soon
as
ever
she
had
fixed
the
date
of
her
departure
that
day
to
her
was
a
day
of
release
on
this
occasion
the
day
had
been
fixed
and
it
was
unfixed
and
changed
and
postponed
because
it
was
manifest
to
lady
milborough
that
she
could
do
good
by
remaining
for
another
fortnight
when
she
made
the
offer
she
said
nothing
of
her
previous
arrangements
lady
rowley
let
her
come
to
me
as
soon
as
her
friend
lady
peterborough
is
at
monkhams
she
can
go
there
thus
it
was
that
nora
found
herself
established
in
eccleston
square
as
she
took
her
place
in
lady
milborough
she
remembered
well
a
certain
day
now
two
years
ago
when
she
had
first
heard
of
the
glories
of
monkhams
in
that
very
house
lady
milborough
as
then
as
she
was
now
had
brought
glascock
and
nora
together
simply
because
she
had
heard
that
the
gentleman
admired
the
young
lady
nora
in
her
pride
had
resented
this
as
interference
had
felt
that
the
thing
had
been
done
and
though
she
had
valued
the
admiration
of
the
man
had
ridiculed
the
action
of
the
woman
as
she
thought
of
it
now
she
was
softened
by
gratitude
she
had
not
on
that
occasion
been
suited
with
a
husband
but
she
had
gained
a
friend
my
dear
said
lady
milborough
as
at
her
request
nora
took
off
her
hat
i
am
afraid
that
the
parties
are
mostly
over
that
is
those
i
go
to
but
we
will
drive
out
every
day
and
the
time
wo
be
so
very
long
it
wo
be
long
for
me
lady
milborough
but
i
can
not
but
know
how
terribly
i
am
putting
you
out
i
am
never
put
out
miss
rowley
said
the
old
lady
as
long
as
i
am
made
to
think
that
what
i
do
is
taken
in
good
part
indeed
indeed
it
shall
be
taken
in
good
part
said
nora
indeed
it
shall
and
she
swore
a
solemn
silent
vow
of
friendship
for
the
dear
old
woman
then
there
came
letters
and
telegrams
from
chambery
dijon
and
paris
and
the
joint
expedition
in
search
of
the
cottage
was
made
to
twickenham
it
was
astonishing
how
enthusiastic
and
how
loving
the
elder
and
the
younger
lady
were
together
before
the
party
from
italy
had
arrived
in
england
nora
had
explained
everything
about
herself
how
impossible
it
had
been
for
her
not
to
love
hugh
stanbury
how
essential
it
had
been
for
her
happiness
and
that
she
should
refuse
glascock
how
terrible
had
been
the
tragedy
of
her
sister
marriage
lady
milborough
spoke
of
the
former
subject
with
none
of
lady
rowley
enthusiasm
but
still
with
an
evident
partiality
for
her
own
rank
which
almost
aroused
nora
to
indignant
eloquence
lady
milborough
was
contented
to
acknowledge
that
nora
might
be
right
seeing
that
her
heart
was
so
firmly
fixed
but
she
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
glascock
being
glascock
had
possessed
a
better
right
to
the
prize
in
question
than
could
have
belonged
to
any
man
who
had
no
recognised
position
in
the
world
seeing
that
her
heart
had
been
given
away
nora
was
no
doubt
right
not
to
separate
her
hand
from
her
heart
but
lady
milborough
was
of
opinion
that
young
ladies
ought
to
have
their
hearts
under
better
control
so
that
the
men
entitled
to
the
prizes
should
get
them
it
was
for
the
welfare
of
england
at
large
that
the
eldest
sons
of
good
families
should
marry
the
sweetest
prettiest
brightest
and
most
lovable
girls
of
their
age
it
is
a
doctrine
on
behalf
of
which
very
much
may
be
said
on
that
other
matter
touching
emily
trevelyan
lady
milborough
frankly
owned
that
she
had
seen
early
in
the
day
that
he
was
the
one
most
in
fault
i
must
say
my
dear
she
said
that
i
very
greatly
dislike
your
friend
colonel
osborne
i
am
sure
that
he
meant
not
the
slightest
harm
no
more
than
she
did
he
was
old
enough
and
ought
to
have
known
better
and
when
the
first
hint
of
an
uneasiness
in
the
mind
of
louis
was
suggested
to
him
his
feelings
as
a
gentleman
should
have
prompted
him
to
remove
himself
let
the
suspicion
have
been
ever
so
absurd
he
should
have
removed
himself
instead
of
that
he
went
after
her
into
devonshire
he
went
to
see
other
friends
lady
milborough
i
hope
it
may
have
been
so
i
hope
it
may
have
been
so
but
he
should
have
cut
off
his
hand
before
he
rang
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
she
was
living
you
will
understand
my
dear
that
i
acquit
your
sister
altogether
i
did
so
all
through
and
said
the
same
to
poor
louis
when
he
came
to
me
but
colonel
osborne
should
have
known
better
why
did
he
write
to
her
why
did
he
go
to
diddulph
why
did
he
let
it
be
thought
that
that
she
was
especially
his
friend
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
am
afraid
he
is
a
very
bad
man
we
had
known
him
so
long
lady
milborough
i
wish
you
had
never
known
him
at
all
poor
louis
if
he
had
only
done
what
i
told
him
at
first
all
might
have
been
well
to
naples
with
your
wife
i
said
to
naples
if
he
had
gone
to
naples
there
would
have
been
no
journeys
to
siena
no
living
at
casalunga
no
separation
but
he
did
seem
to
see
it
in
the
same
light
poor
dear
louis
i
wish
he
had
gone
to
naples
when
i
told
him
while
they
were
going
backwards
and
forwards
looking
at
the
cottage
at
twickenham
and
trying
to
make
things
comfortable
there
for
the
sick
man
lady
milborough
hinted
to
nora
that
it
might
be
distasteful
to
trevelyan
in
his
present
condition
to
have
even
a
staying
in
the
house
with
him
there
was
a
little
chamber
which
nora
had
appropriated
to
herself
and
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
she
should
remain
there
at
least
till
the
of
august
on
which
day
lady
peterborough
had
signified
that
she
and
her
husband
would
be
ready
to
receive
their
visitor
but
lady
milborough
slept
on
the
suggestion
and
on
the
next
morning
hinted
her
disapprobation
you
shall
take
them
down
in
the
carriage
and
their
luggage
can
follow
in
a
cab
but
the
carriage
can
bring
you
back
you
will
see
how
things
are
then
dear
lady
milborough
you
would
go
out
of
town
at
once
if
i
left
you
and
i
shall
not
go
out
of
town
if
you
do
leave
me
what
difference
does
it
make
to
an
old
woman
like
me
i
have
got
no
lover
coming
to
look
for
me
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
tell
my
that
i
shall
not
be
there
for
another
week
or
so
augusta
is
very
glad
to
have
me
but
she
is
the
wisest
woman
in
the
world
and
can
get
on
very
well
without
me
and
as
i
am
the
silliest
i
can
not
you
shall
put
it
in
that
way
if
you
like
it
my
dear
girls
in
your
position
often
do
want
assistance
i
dare
say
you
think
me
very
but
i
am
quite
sure
stanbury
will
be
grateful
to
me
as
you
are
to
be
married
from
monkhams
it
will
be
quite
well
that
you
should
pass
thither
through
my
house
as
an
intermediate
after
leaving
your
father
and
mother
by
all
which
lady
milborough
intended
to
express
an
opinion
that
the
value
of
the
article
which
hugh
stanbury
would
receive
at
the
altar
would
be
enhanced
by
the
distinguished
purity
of
the
hands
through
which
it
had
passed
before
it
came
into
his
possession
in
which
opinion
she
was
probably
right
as
regarded
the
price
put
upon
the
article
by
the
world
at
large
though
it
may
perhaps
be
doubted
whether
the
recipient
himself
would
be
of
the
same
opinion
i
hope
you
know
that
i
am
grateful
whatever
he
may
be
said
nora
after
a
pause
i
think
that
you
take
it
as
it
is
meant
and
that
makes
me
quite
comfortable
lady
milborough
i
shall
love
you
for
ever
and
ever
i
do
think
i
ever
knew
anybody
so
good
as
you
are
or
so
nice
then
i
shall
be
more
than
comfortable
said
lady
milborough
after
that
there
was
an
embrace
and
the
thing
was
settled
chapter
xcv
trevelyan
back
in
england
nora
with
lady
milborough
carriage
and
lady
milborough
coach
and
footman
and
with
a
cab
ready
for
the
luggage
close
behind
the
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
railway
station
when
the
party
from
dover
arrived
she
soon
saw
hugh
upon
the
platform
and
ran
to
him
with
her
news
they
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
each
other
of
themselves
so
anxious
were
they
both
respecting
trevelyan
we
got
a
for
him
at
dover
said
hugh
and
i
think
he
has
borne
the
journey
pretty
well
but
he
feels
the
heat
almost
as
badly
as
in
italy
you
will
hardly
know
him
when
you
see
him
then
when
the
rush
of
passengers
was
gone
trevelyan
was
brought
out
by
hugh
and
the
courier
and
placed
in
lady
milborough
carriage
he
just
smiled
as
his
eye
fell
upon
nora
but
he
did
not
even
put
out
his
hand
to
greet
her
i
am
to
go
in
the
carriage
with
him
said
his
wife
of
course
you
are
and
so
will
i
and
louey
i
think
there
will
be
room
it
is
so
large
there
is
a
cab
for
all
the
things
dear
emily
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
dearest
nora
i
shall
be
able
to
speak
to
you
but
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
now
how
good
you
have
been
has
not
she
been
good
i
do
understand
about
the
cottage
it
belongs
to
some
friend
of
hers
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
say
a
word
about
the
rent
it
is
so
nice
and
looks
upon
the
river
i
hope
that
he
will
like
it
you
will
be
with
us
not
just
at
first
lady
milborough
thinks
i
had
better
not
that
he
will
like
it
better
i
will
come
down
almost
every
day
and
will
stay
if
you
think
he
will
like
it
these
few
words
were
said
while
the
men
were
putting
trevelyan
into
the
carriage
and
then
another
arrangement
was
made
hugh
hired
a
second
cab
in
which
he
and
the
courier
made
a
part
of
the
procession
and
so
they
all
went
to
twickenham
together
hugh
had
not
yet
learned
that
he
would
be
rewarded
by
coming
back
alone
with
nora
in
the
carriage
the
cottage
by
the
river
thames
which
as
far
as
the
party
knew
was
nameless
was
certainly
very
much
better
than
the
house
on
the
top
of
the
hill
at
casalunga
and
now
at
last
the
wife
would
sleep
once
more
under
the
same
roof
with
her
husband
and
the
separation
would
be
over
i
suppose
that
is
the
thames
said
trevelyan
and
they
were
nearly
the
only
words
he
spoke
in
nora
hearing
that
evening
before
she
started
on
her
return
journey
the
two
sisters
were
together
for
a
few
minutes
and
each
told
her
own
budget
of
news
in
short
broken
fragments
there
was
not
much
to
tell
he
is
so
weak
said
trevelyan
that
he
can
do
literally
nothing
he
can
hardly
speak
when
we
give
him
wine
he
will
say
a
few
words
and
his
mind
seems
then
to
be
less
astray
than
it
was
i
have
told
him
just
simply
that
it
was
all
my
doing
that
i
have
been
in
fault
all
through
and
every
now
and
then
he
will
say
a
word
to
shew
me
that
he
remembers
that
i
have
confessed
my
poor
emily
it
was
better
so
what
does
it
all
matter
he
had
suffered
so
that
i
would
have
said
worse
than
that
to
give
him
relief
the
pride
has
gone
out
of
me
so
that
i
do
not
regard
what
anybody
may
say
of
course
it
will
be
said
that
i
went
astray
and
that
he
forgave
me
nobody
will
say
that
dearest
nobody
lady
milborough
is
quite
aware
how
it
all
was
what
does
it
signify
there
are
things
in
life
worse
even
than
a
bad
name
but
he
does
not
think
it
nora
his
mind
is
a
mystery
to
me
i
do
not
know
what
is
in
it
sometimes
i
fancy
that
all
facts
have
been
forgotten
and
that
he
merely
wants
the
childish
gratification
of
being
assured
that
he
is
the
master
then
again
there
come
moments
in
which
i
feel
sure
that
suspicion
is
lurking
within
him
that
he
is
remembering
the
past
and
guarding
against
the
future
when
he
came
into
this
house
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
he
was
fearful
lest
there
was
a
mad
doctor
lurking
about
to
pounce
on
him
i
can
see
in
his
eye
that
he
had
some
such
idea
he
hardly
notices
louey
though
there
was
a
time
even
at
casalunga
when
he
would
not
let
the
child
out
of
his
sight
what
will
you
do
now
i
will
try
to
do
my
duty
that
is
all
but
you
will
have
a
doctor
of
course
he
was
content
to
see
one
in
paris
though
he
would
not
let
me
be
present
hugh
saw
the
gentleman
afterwards
and
he
seemed
to
think
that
the
body
was
worse
than
the
mind
then
nora
told
her
the
name
of
a
doctor
whom
lady
milborough
had
suggested
and
took
her
departure
along
with
hugh
in
the
carriage
in
spite
of
all
the
sorrow
that
they
had
witnessed
and
just
left
their
journey
up
to
london
was
very
pleasant
perhaps
there
is
no
period
so
pleasant
among
all
the
pleasant
periods
of
as
that
in
which
the
intimacy
between
the
lovers
is
so
assured
and
the
coming
event
so
near
as
to
produce
and
to
endure
conversation
about
the
ordinary
little
matters
of
life
what
can
be
done
with
the
limited
means
at
their
mutual
disposal
how
that
life
shall
be
begun
which
they
are
to
lead
together
what
idea
each
has
of
the
duties
what
each
can
do
for
the
other
what
each
will
renounce
for
the
other
there
was
a
true
sense
of
the
delight
of
intimacy
in
the
girl
who
declared
that
she
had
never
loved
her
lover
so
well
as
when
she
told
him
how
many
pairs
of
stockings
she
had
got
it
is
very
sweet
to
gaze
at
the
stars
together
and
it
is
sweet
to
sit
out
among
the
haycocks
the
reading
of
poetry
together
out
of
the
same
book
with
brows
all
close
and
arms
all
mingled
is
very
sweet
the
pouring
out
of
the
whole
heart
in
written
words
which
the
writer
knows
would
be
held
to
be
ridiculous
by
any
eyes
and
any
ears
and
any
sense
but
the
eyes
and
ears
and
sense
of
the
dear
one
to
whom
they
are
sent
is
very
sweet
but
for
the
girl
who
has
made
a
shirt
for
the
man
that
she
loves
there
has
come
a
moment
in
the
last
stitch
of
it
sweeter
than
any
that
stars
haycocks
poetry
or
superlative
epithets
have
produced
nora
rowley
had
never
as
yet
been
thus
useful
on
behalf
of
hugh
stanbury
had
she
done
so
she
might
perhaps
have
been
happier
even
than
she
was
during
this
journey
but
without
the
shirt
it
was
one
of
the
happiest
moments
of
her
life
there
was
nothing
now
to
separate
them
but
their
own
prudential
scruples
and
of
them
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
hugh
stanbury
had
very
few
according
to
his
shewing
he
was
as
well
provided
for
matrimony
as
the
gentleman
in
the
song
who
came
out
to
woo
his
bride
on
a
rainy
night
in
live
stock
he
was
not
so
well
provided
as
the
irish
gentleman
to
whom
we
allude
but
in
regard
to
all
other
provisions
for
comfortable
married
life
he
had
or
at
a
moment
notice
could
have
all
that
was
needed
nora
could
live
just
where
she
pleased
not
exactly
in
whitehall
gardens
or
belgrave
square
but
the
new
road
lupus
street
montague
place
the
north
bank
or
kennington
oval
with
all
their
surrounding
crescents
terraces
and
rows
offered
according
to
him
a
choice
so
wide
either
for
lodgings
or
small
houses
that
their
only
embarrassment
was
in
their
riches
he
had
already
insured
his
life
for
a
thousand
pounds
and
after
paying
yearly
for
that
and
providing
a
certain
surplus
for
saving
five
hundred
a
year
was
the
income
on
which
they
were
to
commence
the
world
of
course
i
wish
it
were
five
thousand
for
your
sake
he
said
and
i
wish
i
were
a
cabinet
minister
or
a
duke
or
a
brewer
but
even
in
heaven
you
know
all
the
angels
be
archangels
nora
assured
him
that
she
would
be
quite
content
with
virtues
simply
angelic
i
hope
you
like
and
potatoes
i
do
he
said
then
she
told
him
of
her
ambition
about
the
acknowledging
that
as
it
must
now
be
shared
between
two
the
glorious
idea
of
putting
a
part
of
it
away
in
a
cupboard
must
be
abandoned
i
do
believe
in
he
said
a
may
mean
anything
at
our
club
a
is
a
sumptuous
and
expensive
luxury
now
a
means
something
definite
and
must
be
economical
then
we
will
have
the
at
home
said
nora
and
you
shall
go
to
your
club
for
the
when
they
reached
eccleston
square
nora
insisted
on
taking
hugh
stanbury
up
to
lady
milborough
it
was
in
vain
that
he
pleaded
that
he
had
come
all
the
way
from
dover
on
a
very
dusty
day
all
the
way
from
dover
including
a
journey
in
a
hansom
cab
to
twickenham
and
back
without
washing
his
hands
and
face
nora
insisted
that
lady
milborough
was
such
a
dear
good
considerate
creature
that
she
would
understand
all
that
and
hugh
was
taken
into
her
presence
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
stanbury
said
the
old
lady
and
hope
you
will
think
that
nora
is
in
good
keeping
she
has
been
telling
me
how
very
kind
you
have
been
to
her
i
do
not
know
where
she
could
have
bestowed
herself
if
you
had
not
received
her
there
nora
i
told
you
he
would
say
so
i
wo
tell
tales
stanbury
but
she
had
all
manner
of
wild
plans
which
i
knew
you
would
approve
but
she
is
very
amiable
and
if
she
will
only
submit
to
you
as
well
as
she
does
to
me
i
do
mean
to
submit
to
him
at
all
lady
milborough
of
course
not
i
am
going
to
marry
for
liberty
my
dear
what
you
say
you
say
in
joke
but
a
great
many
young
women
of
the
present
day
do
i
really
believe
go
up
to
the
altar
and
pronounce
their
marriage
vows
with
the
simple
idea
that
as
soon
as
they
have
done
so
they
are
to
have
their
own
way
in
everything
and
then
people
complain
that
young
men
wo
marry
who
can
wonder
at
it
i
do
think
the
young
men
think
much
about
the
obedience
said
nora
some
marry
for
money
and
some
for
love
but
i
do
think
they
marry
to
get
a
slave
what
do
you
say
mr
stanbury
asked
the
old
lady
i
can
only
assure
you
that
i
sha
marry
for
money
said
he
two
or
three
days
after
this
nora
left
her
friend
in
eccleston
square
and
domesticated
herself
for
awhile
with
her
sister
trevelyan
declared
that
such
an
arrangement
would
be
comfortable
for
her
and
that
it
was
very
desirable
now
as
nora
would
so
soon
be
beyond
her
reach
then
lady
milborough
was
enabled
to
go
to
dorsetshire
which
she
did
not
do
however
till
she
had
presented
nora
with
the
veil
which
she
was
to
wear
on
the
occasion
of
her
wedding
of
course
i
can
not
see
it
my
dear
as
it
is
to
take
place
at
monkhams
but
you
must
write
and
tell
me
the
day
and
i
will
think
of
you
and
you
when
you
put
on
the
veil
must
think
of
me
so
they
parted
and
nora
knew
that
she
had
made
a
friend
for
life
illustration
nora

when
she
first
took
her
place
in
the
house
at
twickenham
as
a
resident
trevelyan
did
not
take
much
notice
of
her
but
after
awhile
he
would
say
a
few
words
to
her
especially
when
it
might
chance
that
she
was
with
him
in
her
sister
absence
he
would
speak
of
dear
emily
and
poor
emily
and
shake
his
head
slowly
and
talk
of
the
pity
of
it
the
pity
of
it
iago
oh
the
pity
of
it
he
said
once
the
allusion
to
her
was
so
terrible
that
she
almost
burst
out
in
anger
as
she
would
have
done
formerly
she
almost
told
him
that
he
had
been
as
wrong
throughout
as
was
the
jealous
husband
in
the
play
whose
words
he
quoted
and
that
his
jealousy
if
continued
was
likely
to
be
as
tragical
but
she
restrained
herself
and
kept
close
to
her
needle
making
let
us
hope
an
auspicious
garment
for
hugh
stanbury
she
has
seen
it
now
he
continued
she
has
seen
it
now
still
she
went
on
with
her
hemming
in
silence
it
certainly
could
not
be
her
duty
to
upset
at
a
word
all
that
her
sister
had
achieved
you
know
that
she
has
confessed
he
asked
pray
pray
do
not
talk
about
it
louis
i
think
you
ought
to
know
he
said
then
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
left
the
room
she
could
not
stand
it
even
though
he
were
mad
even
though
he
were
dying
she
went
to
her
sister
and
repeated
what
had
been
said
you
had
better
not
notice
it
said
emily
it
is
only
a
proof
of
what
i
told
you
there
are
times
in
which
his
mind
is
as
active
as
ever
it
was
but
it
is
active
in
so
terrible
a
direction
i
can
not
sit
and
hear
it
and
what
am
i
to
say
when
he
asks
me
a
question
as
he
did
just
now
he
said
that
you
had
confessed
so
i
have
do
none
confess
but
the
guilty
what
is
all
that
we
have
read
about
the
inquisition
and
the
old
tortures
i
have
had
to
learn
that
torturing
has
not
gone
out
of
the
world
that
is
all
i
must
go
away
if
he
says
the
same
thing
to
me
so
again
that
is
nonsense
nora
if
i
can
bear
it
can
not
you
would
you
have
me
drive
him
into
violence
again
by
disputing
with
him
upon
such
a
subject
but
he
may
recover
and
then
he
will
remember
what
you
have
said
if
he
recovers
altogether
he
will
suspect
nothing
i
must
take
my
chance
of
that
you
can
not
suppose
that
i
have
not
thought
about
it
i
have
often
sworn
to
myself
that
though
the
world
should
fall
around
me
nothing
should
make
me
acknowledge
that
i
had
ever
been
untrue
to
my
duty
as
a
married
woman
either
in
deed
or
word
or
thought
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
poor
wretches
who
were
tortured
in
their
cells
used
to
make
the
same
resolutions
as
to
their
confessions
but
yet
when
their
nails
were
dragged
out
of
them
they
would
own
to
anything
my
nails
have
been
dragged
out
and
i
have
been
willing
to
confess
anything
when
he
talks
of
the
pity
of
it
of
course
i
know
what
he
means
there
has
been
something
some
remainder
of
a
feeling
which
has
still
kept
him
from
asking
me
that
question
may
god
in
his
mercy
continue
to
him
that
feeling
but
you
would
answer
truly
how
can
i
say
what
i
might
answer
when
the
torturer
is
at
my
nails
if
you
knew
how
great
was
the
difficulty
to
get
him
away
from
that
place
in
italy
and
bring
him
here
and
what
it
was
to
feel
that
one
was
bound
to
stay
near
him
and
that
yet
one
was
impotent
and
to
know
that
even
that
refuge
must
soon
cease
for
him
and
that
he
might
have
gone
out
and
died
on
the
or
have
done
anything
which
the
momentary
strength
of
madness
might
have
dictated
if
you
could
understand
all
this
you
would
not
be
surprised
at
my
submitting
to
any
degradation
which
would
help
to
bring
him
here
stanbury
was
often
down
at
the
cottage
and
nora
could
discuss
the
matter
better
with
him
than
with
her
sister
and
stanbury
could
learn
more
thoroughly
from
the
physician
who
was
now
attending
trevelyan
what
was
the
state
of
the
sick
man
than
emily
could
do
according
to
the
doctor
idea
there
was
more
of
ailment
in
the
body
than
in
the
mind
he
admitted
that
his
patient
thoughts
had
been
forced
to
dwell
on
one
subject
till
they
had
become
distorted
untrue
jaundiced
and
perhaps
but
he
seemed
to
doubt
whether
there
had
ever
been
a
time
at
which
it
could
have
been
decided
that
trevelyan
was
so
mad
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
the
law
should
interfere
to
take
care
of
him
a
man
so
argued
the
doctor
need
not
be
mad
because
he
is
jealous
even
though
his
jealousy
be
ever
so
absurd
and
trevelyan
in
his
jealousy
had
done
nothing
cruel
nothing
wasteful
nothing
infamous
in
all
this
nora
was
very
little
inclined
to
agree
with
the
doctor
and
thought
nothing
could
be
more
infamous
than
trevelyan
conduct
at
the
present
moment
unless
indeed
he
could
be
screened
from
infamy
by
that
plea
of
madness
but
then
there
was
more
behind
trevelyan
had
been
so
wasted
by
the
kind
of
life
which
he
had
led
and
possessed
by
nature
stamina
so
insufficient
to
resist
such
debility
that
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
he
would
not
sink
altogether
before
he
could
be
made
to
begin
to
rise
but
one
thing
was
clear
he
should
be
contradicted
in
nothing
if
he
chose
to
say
that
the
moon
was
made
of
green
cheese
let
it
be
conceded
to
him
that
the
moon
was
made
of
green
cheese
should
he
make
any
other
assertion
equally
removed
from
the
truth
let
it
not
be
contradicted
who
would
oppose
a
man
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
then
hugh
the
sooner
i
am
at
monkhams
the
better
said
nora
who
had
again
been
subjected
to
inuendoes
which
had
been
unendurable
to
her
this
was
on
the
of
august
and
it
still
wanted
three
days
to
that
on
which
the
journey
to
monkhams
was
to
be
made
he
never
says
anything
to
me
on
the
subject
said
hugh
because
you
have
made
him
afraid
of
you
i
almost
think
that
emily
and
the
doctor
are
wrong
in
their
treatment
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
stand
up
to
him
and
tell
him
the
truth
but
the
three
days
passed
away
and
nora
was
not
driven
to
any
such
vindication
of
her
sister
character
towards
her
sister
husband
chapter
xcvi
monkhams
illustration
on
the
of
august
nora
rowley
left
the
cottage
by
the
at
twickenham
and
went
down
to
monkhams
the
reader
need
hardly
be
told
that
hugh
brought
her
up
from
twickenham
and
sent
her
off
in
the
railway
carriage
they
agreed
that
no
day
could
be
fixed
for
their
marriage
till
something
further
should
be
known
of
trevelyan
state
while
he
was
in
his
present
condition
such
a
marriage
could
not
have
been
other
than
very
sad
nora
when
she
left
the
cottage
was
still
very
bitter
against
her
quoting
the
doctor
opinion
as
to
his
sanity
and
expressing
her
own
as
to
his
conduct
under
that
supposition
she
also
believed
that
he
would
rally
in
health
and
was
therefore
on
that
account
less
inclined
to
pity
him
than
was
his
wife
emily
trevelyan
of
course
saw
more
of
him
than
did
her
sister
and
understood
better
how
possible
it
was
that
a
man
might
be
in
such
a
condition
as
to
be
neither
mad
nor
sane
not
mad
so
that
all
power
over
his
own
actions
need
be
taken
from
him
nor
sane
so
that
he
must
be
held
to
be
accountable
for
his
words
and
thoughts
trevelyan
did
nothing
and
attempted
to
do
nothing
that
could
injure
his
wife
and
child
he
submitted
himself
to
medical
advice
he
did
not
throw
away
his
money
he
had
no
bozzle
now
waiting
at
his
heels
he
was
generally
passive
in
his
wife
hands
as
to
all
outward
things
he
was
not
violent
in
rebuke
nor
did
he
often
allude
to
their
past
unhappiness
but
he
still
maintained
by
a
word
spoken
every
now
and
then
that
he
had
been
right
throughout
in
his
contest
with
his
wife
and
that
his
wife
had
at
last
acknowledged
that
it
was
so
she
never
contradicted
him
and
he
became
bolder
and
bolder
in
his
assertions
endeavouring
on
various
occasions
to
obtain
some
expression
of
an
assent
from
nora
but
nora
would
not
assent
and
he
would
scowl
at
her
saying
words
both
in
her
presence
and
behind
her
back
which
implied
that
she
was
his
enemy
why
not
yield
to
him
her
sister
said
the
day
before
she
went
i
have
yielded
and
your
doing
so
can
not
make
it
worse
i
ca
do
it
it
would
be
false
it
is
better
that
i
should
go
away
i
can
not
pretend
to
agree
with
him
when
i
know
that
his
mind
is
working
altogether
under
a
delusion
when
the
hour
for
her
departure
came
and
hugh
was
waiting
for
her
she
thought
that
it
would
be
better
that
she
should
go
without
seeing
trevelyan
there
will
only
be
more
anger
she
pleaded
but
her
sister
would
not
be
contented
that
she
should
leave
the
house
in
this
fashion
and
urged
at
last
with
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
that
this
might
possibly
be
the
last
interview
between
them
say
a
word
to
him
in
kindness
before
you
leave
us
said
trevelyan
then
nora
went
up
to
her
and
told
him
that
she
was
going
and
expressed
a
hope
that
he
might
be
stronger
when
she
returned
and
as
she
did
so
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
intending
to
press
his
in
token
of
affection
but
his
face
was
turned
from
her
and
he
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
her
louis
said
his
wife
nora
is
going
to
monkhams
you
will
say
to
her
before
she
goes
if
she
be
not
my
enemy
i
will
said
he
i
have
never
been
your
enemy
louis
said
nora
and
certainly
i
am
not
now
she
had
better
go
he
said
it
is
very
little
more
that
i
expect
of
any
one
in
this
world
but
i
will
recognise
no
one
as
my
friend
who
will
not
acknowledge
that
i
have
been
sinned
against
during
the
last
two
years
sinned
against
cruelly
and
utterly
emily
who
was
standing
at
the
shuddered
as
she
heard
this
but
made
no
reply
nor
did
nora
speak
again
but
crept
silently
out
of
the
room
and
in
half
a
minute
her
sister
followed
her
i
feared
how
it
would
be
said
nora
we
can
only
do
our
best
god
knows
that
i
try
to
do
mine
i
do
not
think
you
will
ever
see
him
again
said
hugh
to
her
in
the
train
would
you
have
had
me
act
otherwise
it
is
not
that
it
would
have
been
a
lie
i
would
not
have
minded
that
to
ease
the
shattered
feelings
of
one
so
infirm
and
suffering
as
he
in
dealing
with
mad
people
i
suppose
one
must
be
false
but
i
should
have
been
accusing
her
and
it
may
be
that
he
will
get
well
and
it
might
be
that
he
would
then
remember
what
i
had
said
at
the
station
near
monkhams
she
was
met
by
lady
peterborough
in
the
carriage
a
tall
footman
in
livery
came
on
to
the
platform
to
shew
her
the
way
and
to
look
after
her
luggage
and
she
could
not
fail
to
remember
that
the
man
might
have
been
her
own
servant
instead
of
being
the
servant
of
her
who
now
sat
in
lord
peterborough
carriage
and
when
she
saw
the
carriage
and
her
ladyship
great
bay
horses
and
the
glittering
harness
and
the
respectably
responsible
coachman
and
the
arms
on
the
panel
she
smiled
to
herself
at
the
sight
of
these
first
outward
manifestations
of
the
rank
and
wealth
of
the
man
who
had
once
been
her
lover
there
are
men
who
look
as
though
they
were
the
owners
of
bay
horses
and
responsible
coachmen
and
family
blazons
from
whose
outward
personal
appearance
demeanour
and
tone
of
voice
one
would
expect
a
following
of
liveries
and
a
magnificence
of
belongings
but
glascock
had
by
no
means
been
such
a
man
it
had
suited
his
taste
to
keep
these
things
in
abeyance
and
to
place
his
pride
in
the
oaks
and
elms
of
his
park
rather
than
in
any
of
those
appanages
of
grandeur
which
a
man
may
carry
about
with
him
he
could
talk
of
his
breed
of
sheep
on
an
occasion
but
he
never
talked
of
his
horses
and
though
he
knew
his
position
and
all
its
glories
as
well
as
any
nobleman
in
england
he
was
ever
inclined
to
hang
back
a
little
in
going
out
of
a
room
and
to
bear
himself
as
though
he
were
a
small
personage
in
the
world
some
perception
of
all
this
came
across
nora
mind
as
she
saw
the
equipage
and
tried
to
reflect
at
a
moment
notice
whether
the
case
might
have
been
different
with
her
had
glascock
worn
a
little
of
his
tinsel
outside
when
she
first
met
him
of
course
she
told
herself
that
had
he
worn
it
all
on
the
outside
and
carried
it
ever
so
gracefully
it
could
have
made
no
difference
it
was
very
plain
however
that
though
glascock
did
not
like
bright
feathers
for
himself
he
chose
that
his
wife
should
wear
them
nothing
could
be
prettier
than
the
way
in
which
caroline
spalding
whom
we
first
saw
as
she
was
about
to
be
stuck
into
the
interior
of
the
diligence
at
michel
now
filled
her
carriage
as
lady
peterborough
the
greeting
between
them
was
very
affectionate
and
there
was
a
kiss
in
the
carriage
even
though
the
two
pretty
hats
perhaps
suffered
something
we
are
so
glad
to
have
you
at
last
said
lady
peterborough
of
course
we
are
very
quiet
but
you
mind
that
nora
declared
that
no
house
could
be
too
quiet
for
her
and
then
said
something
of
the
melancholy
scene
which
she
had
just
left
and
no
time
is
fixed
for
your
own
marriage
but
of
course
it
has
not
been
possible
and
why
should
you
be
in
a
hurry
we
quite
understand
that
this
is
to
be
your
home
till
everything
has
arranged
itself
there
was
a
drive
of
four
or
five
miles
before
they
reached
the
park
gates
and
nothing
could
be
kinder
or
more
friendly
than
was
the
new
peeress
but
nora
told
herself
that
there
was
no
forgetting
that
her
friend
was
a
peeress
she
would
not
be
so
as
to
suggest
to
herself
that
her
friend
patronised
her
and
indeed
had
she
done
so
the
suggestion
would
have
been
false
but
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
a
certain
sensation
of
external
inferiority
and
of
a
feeling
that
the
superiority
ought
to
be
on
her
side
as
all
this
might
have
been
hers
only
that
she
had
not
thought
it
worth
her
while
to
accept
it
as
these
ideas
came
into
her
mind
she
hated
herself
for
entertaining
them
and
yet
come
they
would
while
she
was
talking
about
her
emblematic
with
hugh
she
had
no
regret
no
uneasiness
no
conception
that
any
state
of
life
could
be
better
for
her
than
that
state
in
which
an
emblematic
was
of
vital
importance
but
she
could
not
bring
her
mind
to
the
same
condition
of
unalloyed
purity
while
sitting
with
lady
peterborough
in
lord
peterborough
carriage
and
for
her
default
in
this
respect
she
hated
herself
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
park
said
her
friend
and
where
is
the
house
you
ca
see
the
house
for
ever
so
far
yet
it
is
two
miles
off
there
is
about
a
mile
before
you
come
to
the
gates
and
over
a
mile
afterwards
one
has
a
sort
of
feeling
when
one
is
in
that
one
get
out
it
is
so
big
in
so
speaking
it
was
lady
special
endeavour
to
state
without
a
boast
facts
which
were
indifferent
but
which
must
be
stated
it
is
very
magnificent
said
nora
there
was
in
her
voice
the
slightest
touch
of
sarcasm
which
she
would
have
given
the
world
not
to
have
uttered
but
it
had
been
irrepressible
lady
peterborough
understood
it
instantly
and
forgave
it
not
attributing
to
it
more
than
its
true
meaning
acknowledging
to
herself
that
it
was
natural
dear
nora
she
said
not
knowing
what
to
say
blushing
as
she
spoke
the
magnificence
is
nothing
but
the
man
love
is
everything
nora
shook
herself
and
determined
that
she
would
behave
well
the
effort
should
be
made
and
the
required
result
should
be
produced
by
it
the
magnificence
as
an
adjunct
is
a
great
deal
she
said
and
for
his
sake
i
hope
that
you
enjoy
it
of
course
i
enjoy
it
wallachia
teachings
and
preachings
have
all
been
thrown
to
the
wind
i
hope
not
quite
all
poor
dear
wally
i
got
a
letter
from
her
the
other
day
which
she
began
by
saying
that
she
would
attune
her
correspondence
to
my
changed
condition
in
life
i
understood
the
reproach
so
thoroughly
and
when
she
told
me
little
details
of
individual
men
and
women
and
of
things
she
had
seen
and
said
not
a
word
about
the
rights
of
women
or
even
of
politics
generally
i
felt
that
i
was
a
degraded
creature
in
her
sight
but
though
you
laugh
at
her
she
did
me
good
and
will
do
good
to
others
here
we
are
inside
monkhams
and
now
you
must
look
at
the
avenue
nora
was
now
rather
proud
of
herself
she
had
made
the
effort
and
it
had
been
successful
and
she
felt
that
she
could
speak
naturally
and
express
her
thoughts
honestly
i
remember
his
telling
me
about
the
avenue
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
and
here
it
is
i
did
not
think
then
that
i
should
ever
live
to
see
the
glories
of
monkhams
does
it
go
all
the
way
like
this
to
the
house
not
quite
where
you
see
the
light
at
the
end
the
road
turns
to
the
right
and
the
house
is
just
before
you
there
are
great
iron
gates
and
terraces
and
wondrous
paraphernalia
before
you
get
up
to
the
door
i
can
tell
you
monkhams
is
quite
a
wonder
i
have
to
shut
myself
up
every
wednesday
morning
and
hand
the
house
over
to
crutch
the
housekeeper
who
comes
out
in
a
miraculous
brown
silk
gown
to
shew
it
to
visitors
on
other
days
you
find
crutch
quite
civil
and
useful
but
on
wednesdays
she
is
majestic
charles
always
goes
off
among
his
sheep
on
that
day
and
i
shut
myself
up
with
a
pile
of
books
in
a
little
room
you
will
have
to
be
imprisoned
with
me
i
do
so
long
to
peep
at
the
visitors
and
i
dare
say
they
want
to
peep
at
you
i
proposed
at
first
to
shew
them
round
myself
but
charles
let
me
it
would
have
broken
crutch
heart
that
what
charles
said
he
thinks
that
crutch
tells
them
that
i
locked
up
somewhere
and
that
that
gives
a
zest
to
the
search
some
people
from
nottingham
once
did
break
into
old
lady
peterborough
room
and
the
shew
was
stopped
for
a
year
there
was
such
a
row
about
it
it
prevented
charles
coming
up
for
the
county
but
he
would
have
got
in
and
therefore
it
was
lucky
and
saved
money
by
this
time
nora
was
quite
at
her
ease
but
still
there
was
before
her
the
other
difficulty
of
meeting
lord
peterborough
they
were
driven
out
of
the
avenue
and
round
to
the
right
and
through
the
iron
gate
and
up
to
the
huge
front
door
there
upon
the
top
step
was
standing
lord
peterborough
with
a
billycock
hat
and
a
very
old
shooting
coat
and
nankeen
trousers
which
were
considerably
too
short
for
him
it
was
one
of
the
happinesses
of
his
life
to
dress
just
as
he
pleased
as
he
went
about
his
own
place
and
it
certainly
was
his
pleasure
to
wear
older
clothes
than
any
one
else
in
his
establishment
miss
rowley
he
said
coming
forward
to
give
her
a
hand
out
of
the
carriage
i
am
delighted
that
you
should
see
monkhams
at
last
you
see
i
have
kept
you
to
your
promise
caroline
has
been
telling
me
everything
about
it
but
she
is
not
quite
a
complete
guide
as
yet
she
does
not
know
where
the
seven
oaks
are
do
you
remember
telling
me
of
the
seven
oaks
of
course
i
do
they
are
five
miles
off
at
clatton
farm
carry
i
do
think
you
have
been
near
clatton
yet
we
will
ride
there
and
thus
nora
rowley
was
made
at
home
at
monkhams
she
was
made
at
home
and
after
a
week
or
two
she
was
very
happy
she
soon
perceived
that
her
host
was
a
perfect
gentleman
and
as
such
a
man
to
be
much
loved
she
had
probably
never
questioned
the
fact
whether
glascock
was
a
gentleman
or
not
and
now
she
did
not
analyse
it
it
probably
never
occurred
to
her
even
at
the
present
time
to
say
to
herself
that
he
was
certainly
that
thing
so
impossible
of
definition
and
so
capable
of
recognition
but
she
knew
that
she
had
to
do
with
one
whose
presence
was
always
pleasant
to
her
whose
words
and
acts
towards
her
extorted
her
approbation
whose
thoughts
seemed
to
her
to
be
always
good
and
manly
of
course
she
had
not
loved
him
because
she
had
previously
known
hugh
stanbury
there
could
be
no
comparison
between
the
two
men
there
was
a
brightness
about
hugh
which
lord
peterborough
could
not
rival
otherwise
except
for
this
reason
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
impossible
that
any
young
woman
should
fail
to
love
lord
peterborough
when
asked
to
do
so
about
the
middle
of
september
there
came
a
very
happy
time
for
her
when
hugh
was
asked
down
to
shoot
partridges
in
the
doing
of
which
however
all
his
brightness
did
not
bring
him
near
in
excellence
to
his
host
lord
peterborough
had
been
shooting
partridges
all
his
life
and
shot
them
with
a
precision
which
excited
hugh
envy
to
own
the
truth
stanbury
did
not
shoot
well
and
was
treated
rather
with
scorn
by
the
gamekeeper
but
in
other
respects
he
spent
three
or
four
of
the
happiest
days
of
his
life
he
had
his
work
to
do
and
after
the
second
day
over
the
stubbles
declared
that
the
exigencies
of
the
were
too
severe
to
enable
him
to
go
out
with
his
gun
again
but
those
rambles
about
the
park
with
nora
for
which
among
the
exigencies
of
the
he
did
find
opportunity
were
never
to
be
forgotten
of
course
i
remember
that
it
might
have
been
mine
she
said
sitting
with
him
under
an
old
hollow
withered
sloping
stump
of
an
oak
which
still
however
had
sufficient
of
a
head
growing
from
one
edge
of
the
trunk
to
give
them
the
shade
they
wanted
and
if
you
wish
me
to
own
to
regrets
i
will
it
would
kill
me
i
think
if
you
did
and
yet
i
can
not
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
your
rank
and
position
in
life
might
have
been
so
so
suitable
to
you
no
hugh
there
you
wrong
i
have
thought
about
it
a
good
deal
too
and
i
know
very
well
that
the
cold
in
the
cupboard
is
the
thing
for
me
caroline
will
do
very
well
here
she
looks
like
a
peeress
and
bears
her
honours
grandly
but
they
will
never
harden
her
i
too
could
have
been
magnificent
with
fine
feathers
most
birds
are
equal
to
so
much
as
that
i
fancy
that
i
could
have
looked
the
part
of
the
fine
english
lady
and
could
have
patronised
clergymen
wives
in
the
country
could
have
held
my
own
among
my
peers
in
london
and
could
have
kept
crutch
in
order
but
it
would
have
hardened
me
and
i
should
have
learned
to
think
that
to
be
a
lady
of
fashion
was
everything
i
do
not
believe
a
bit
of
it
it
is
better
as
it
is
hugh
for
me
at
least
i
had
always
a
sort
of
conviction
that
it
would
be
better
though
i
had
a
longing
to
play
the
other
part
then
you
came
and
you
have
saved
me
nevertheless
it
is
very
nice
hugh
to
have
the
oaks
to
sit
under
stanbury
declared
that
it
was
very
nice
illustration
monkhams
but
still
nothing
was
settled
about
the
wedding
condition
was
so
uncertain
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
settle
anything
though
nothing
was
said
on
the
subject
between
stanbury
and
trevelyan
and
nothing
written
between
nora
and
her
sister
it
could
not
but
be
remembered
that
should
trevelyan
die
his
widow
would
require
a
home
with
them
they
were
deterred
from
choosing
a
house
by
this
reflection
and
were
deterred
from
naming
a
day
also
by
the
consideration
that
were
they
to
do
so
trevelyan
state
might
still
probably
prevent
it
but
this
was
arranged
that
if
trevelyan
lived
through
the
winter
or
even
if
he
should
not
live
their
marriage
should
not
be
postponed
beyond
the
end
of
march
till
that
time
lord
peterborough
would
remain
at
monkhams
and
it
was
understood
that
nora
invitation
extended
to
that
period
if
my
wife
does
not
get
tired
of
you
i
shall
not
lord
peterborough
said
to
nora
the
thing
is
that
when
you
do
go
we
shall
miss
you
so
terribly
in
september
too
there
happened
another
event
which
took
stanbury
to
exeter
and
all
needful
particulars
as
to
that
event
shall
be
narrated
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
xcvii
brooke
burgess
it
may
be
doubted
whether
there
was
a
happier
young
woman
in
england
than
dorothy
stanbury
when
that
september
came
which
was
to
make
her
the
wife
of
brooke
burgess
the
new
partner
in
the
firm
of
cropper
and
burgess
her
early
aspirations
in
life
had
been
so
low
and
of
late
there
had
come
upon
her
such
a
succession
of
soft
showers
of
success
mingled
now
and
then
with
slight
threatenings
of
storms
which
had
passed
away
that
the
close
at
exeter
seemed
to
her
to
have
become
a
very
paradise
her
aunt
temper
had
sometimes
been
to
her
as
the
threat
of
a
storm
and
there
had
been
the
gibson
marriage
treaty
and
the
opposition
to
the
other
marriage
treaty
which
had
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
very
preferable
but
everything
had
gone
at
last
as
though
she
had
been
fortune
favourite
and
now
had
come
this
beautiful
arrangement
about
cropper
and
burgess
which
would
save
her
from
being
carried
away
to
live
among
strangers
in
london
when
she
first
became
known
to
us
on
her
coming
to
exeter
in
compliance
with
her
aunt
suggestion
she
was
timid
silent
and
altogether
without
even
they
who
knew
her
best
had
never
guessed
that
she
possessed
a
keen
sense
of
humour
a
nice
appreciation
of
character
and
a
quiet
reticent
wit
of
her
own
under
that
staid
and
frightened
demeanour
since
her
engagement
with
brooke
burgess
it
seemed
to
those
who
watched
her
that
her
character
had
become
changed
as
does
that
of
a
flower
when
it
opens
itself
in
its
growth
the
sweet
gifts
of
nature
within
became
visible
the
petals
sprang
to
view
and
the
leaves
spread
themselves
and
the
sweet
scent
was
felt
upon
the
air
had
she
remained
at
nuncombe
it
is
probable
that
none
would
ever
have
known
her
but
her
sister
it
was
necessary
to
this
flower
that
it
should
be
warmed
by
the
sun
of
life
and
strengthened
by
the
breezes
of
opposition
and
filled
by
the
showers
of
companionship
before
it
could
become
aware
of
its
own
loveliness
dorothy
was
one
who
had
she
remained
ever
unseen
in
the
retirement
of
her
mother
village
cottage
would
have
lived
and
died
ignorant
of
even
her
own
capabilities
for
enjoyment
she
had
not
dreamed
that
she
could
win
a
man
love
had
hardly
dreamed
till
she
had
lived
at
exeter
that
she
had
love
of
her
own
to
give
back
in
return
she
had
not
known
that
she
could
be
firm
in
her
own
opinion
that
she
could
laugh
herself
and
cause
others
to
laugh
that
she
could
be
a
lady
and
know
that
other
women
were
not
so
that
she
had
good
looks
of
her
own
and
could
be
very
happy
when
told
of
them
by
lips
that
she
loved
the
flower
that
blows
the
quickest
is
never
the
sweetest
the
fruit
that
ripens
tardily
has
ever
the
finest
flavour
it
is
often
the
same
with
men
and
women
the
lad
who
talks
at
twenty
as
men
should
talk
at
thirty
has
seldom
much
to
say
worth
the
hearing
when
he
is
forty
and
the
girl
who
at
eighteen
can
shine
in
society
with
composure
has
generally
given
over
shining
before
she
is
a
woman
with
dorothy
the
scent
and
beauty
of
the
flower
and
the
flavour
of
the
fruit
had
come
late
but
the
fruit
will
keep
and
the
flower
will
not
fall
to
pieces
with
the
heat
of
an
evening
how
marvellously
your
bride
has
changed
since
she
has
been
here
said
machugh
to
miss
stanbury
we
thought
she
could
say
boo
to
a
goose
at
first
but
she
holds
her
own
now
among
the
best
of
of
course
she
does
why
should
she
i
never
knew
a
stanbury
yet
that
was
a
fool
they
are
a
wonderful
family
of
course
said
machugh
but
i
think
that
of
all
of
them
she
is
the
most
wonderful
old
barty
said
something
to
her
at
my
house
yesterday
that
was
intended
to
be
kind
when
did
he
ever
intend
to
be
kind
but
he
got
no
change
out
of
her
burgesses
have
been
in
exeter
a
long
time
she
said
i
do
see
why
we
should
not
get
on
at
any
rate
as
well
as
those
before
us
barty
grunted
and
growled
and
slunk
away
he
thought
she
would
shake
in
her
shoes
when
he
spoke
to
her
he
has
never
been
able
to
make
a
stanbury
shake
in
her
shoes
yet
said
the
old
lady
early
in
september
dorothy
went
to
nuncombe
putney
to
spend
a
week
with
her
mother
and
sister
at
the
cottage
she
had
insisted
on
this
though
priscilla
had
hinted
somewhat
unnecessarily
that
dorothy
with
her
past
comforts
and
her
future
prospects
would
find
the
accommodation
at
the
cottage
very
limited
i
suppose
you
and
i
pris
can
sleep
in
the
same
bed
as
we
always
did
she
said
with
a
tear
in
each
eye
then
priscilla
had
felt
ashamed
of
herself
and
had
bade
her
come
the
truth
is
dolly
said
the
elder
sister
that
we
feel
so
unlike
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
at
nuncombe
that
i
afraid
lose
your
brightness
and
become
dowdy
and
grim
and
misanthropic
as
we
are
when
mamma
and
i
sit
down
to
what
we
call
dinner
i
always
feel
that
there
is
a
grace
hovering
in
the
air
different
to
that
which
she
says
and
what
is
it
pris
pray
god
do
quite
starve
us
and
let
everybody
else
have
indigestion
we
do
say
it
out
loud
but
there
it
is
and
the
spirit
of
it
might
damp
the
orange
blossoms
she
went
of
course
and
the
orange
blossoms
were
not
damped
she
had
long
walks
with
her
sister
round
by
niddon
and
ridleigh
and
even
as
far
distant
as
cockchaffington
where
much
was
said
about
that
wicked
colonel
as
they
stood
looking
at
the
porch
of
the
church
i
shall
be
so
happy
said
dorothy
when
you
and
mother
come
to
us
it
will
be
such
a
joy
to
me
that
you
should
be
my
guests
but
we
shall
not
come
why
not
priscilla
i
know
it
will
be
so
mamma
will
not
care
for
going
if
i
do
not
go
and
why
should
you
not
come
for
a
hundred
reasons
all
of
which
you
know
dolly
i
am
stiff
impracticable
and
very
bad
at
going
about
visiting
i
am
always
thinking
that
other
people
ought
to
have
indigestion
and
perhaps
i
might
come
to
have
some
such
feeling
about
you
and
brooke
i
should
not
be
at
all
afraid
of
that
i
know
that
my
place
in
the
world
is
here
at
nuncombe
putney
i
have
a
pride
about
myself
and
think
that
i
never
did
wrong
but
once
when
i
let
mamma
go
into
that
odious
clock
house
it
is
a
bad
pride
and
yet
i
proud
of
it
i
have
got
a
gown
fit
to
go
and
stay
with
you
when
you
become
a
grand
lady
in
exeter
i
do
doubt
you
give
me
any
sort
of
gown
i
wanted
of
course
i
would
ai
we
sisters
pris
i
shall
not
be
so
much
your
sister
as
he
will
be
your
husband
besides
i
hate
to
take
things
when
hugh
sends
money
and
for
mamma
sake
it
is
accepted
i
always
feel
uneasy
while
it
lasts
and
think
that
that
plague
of
an
indigestion
ought
to
come
upon
me
also
do
you
remember
the
lamb
that
came
when
you
went
away
it
made
me
so
sick
but
priscilla
is
that
morbid
of
course
it
is
you
do
suppose
i
really
think
it
grand
i
am
morbid
but
i
am
strong
enough
to
live
on
and
not
get
killed
by
the
morbidity
heaven
knows
how
much
more
there
may
be
of
it
forty
years
perhaps
and
probably
the
greater
portion
of
that
absolutely
alone
no
you
be
with
us
then
if
it
should
come
i
think
not
dolly
not
to
have
a
hole
of
my
own
would
be
intolerable
to
me
but
as
i
was
saying
i
shall
not
be
unhappy
to
enjoy
life
as
you
do
is
i
suppose
out
of
the
question
for
me
but
i
have
a
satisfaction
when
i
get
to
the
end
of
the
quarter
and
find
that
there
is
not
due
to
any
one
things
get
dearer
and
dearer
but
i
have
a
comfort
even
in
that
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
should
like
to
bring
myself
to
the
straw
a
day
of
course
there
were
offers
made
of
aid
offers
which
were
rather
prayers
and
plans
suggested
of
what
might
be
done
between
brooke
and
hugh
but
priscilla
declared
that
all
such
plans
were
odious
to
her
why
should
you
be
unhappy
about
us
she
continued
we
will
come
and
see
you
at
least
i
will
perhaps
once
in
six
months
and
you
shall
pay
for
the
railway
ticket
only
i
wo
stay
because
of
the
gown
is
not
that
nonsense
pris
just
at
present
it
is
because
mamma
and
i
have
both
got
new
gowns
for
the
wedding
hugh
sent
them
and
ever
so
much
money
to
buy
bonnets
and
gloves
he
is
to
be
married
himself
soon
down
at
a
place
called
monkhams
nora
is
staying
there
yes
with
a
lord
said
priscilla
we
have
to
go
there
at
any
rate
you
liked
nora
when
she
was
here
very
much
though
i
thought
her
but
she
is
not
worldly
and
she
is
conscientious
she
might
have
married
that
lord
herself
if
she
would
i
do
like
her
when
she
comes
to
you
at
exeter
if
the
wedding
gown
is
quite
worn
out
i
shall
come
and
see
her
i
knew
she
liked
him
when
she
was
here
but
she
never
said
so
she
is
very
pretty
is
she
not
he
sent
me
her
photograph
she
is
handsome
rather
than
pretty
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
you
two
should
be
married
and
so
grandly
married
and
that
i
shall
never
never
have
any
one
to
love
oh
priscilla
do
not
say
that
if
i
have
a
child
will
you
not
love
it
it
will
be
your
child
not
mine
do
not
suppose
that
i
complain
i
know
that
it
is
right
i
know
that
you
ought
to
be
married
and
i
ought
not
i
know
that
there
is
not
a
man
in
devonshire
who
would
take
me
or
a
man
in
devonshire
whom
i
would
accept
i
know
that
i
am
quite
unfit
for
any
other
kind
of
life
than
this
i
should
make
any
man
wretched
and
any
man
would
make
me
wretched
but
why
is
it
so
i
believe
that
you
would
make
any
man
happy
i
hope
to
make
brooke
happy
of
course
you
will
and
therefore
you
deserve
it
we
go
home
now
dear
and
get
mamma
things
ready
for
the
great
day
on
the
afternoon
before
the
great
day
all
the
visitors
were
to
come
and
during
the
forenoon
old
miss
stanbury
was
in
a
great
fidget
luckily
for
dorothy
her
own
preparations
were
already
made
so
that
she
could
give
her
time
to
her
aunt
without
injury
to
herself
miss
stanbury
had
come
to
think
of
herself
as
though
all
the
reality
of
her
life
had
passed
away
from
her
every
resolution
that
she
had
formed
had
been
broken
she
had
had
the
great
enemy
of
her
life
barty
burgess
in
the
house
with
her
upon
terms
that
were
intended
to
be
amicable
and
had
arranged
with
him
a
plan
for
the
division
of
the
family
property
her
whom
in
the
heyday
of
her
strength
she
had
chosen
to
regard
as
her
enemy
and
with
whom
even
as
yet
there
had
been
no
reconciliation
was
about
to
become
her
guest
as
was
also
priscilla
whom
she
had
ever
disliked
almost
as
much
as
she
had
respected
she
had
quarrelled
utterly
with
hugh
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
possible
chance
of
a
reconciliation
and
he
also
was
about
to
be
her
guest
and
then
as
to
her
chosen
heir
she
was
now
assisting
him
in
doing
the
only
thing
as
to
which
she
had
declared
that
if
he
did
do
it
he
should
not
be
her
heir
as
she
went
about
the
house
under
an
idea
that
such
a
multiplicity
of
persons
could
not
be
housed
and
fed
without
superhuman
exertion
she
thought
of
all
this
and
could
not
help
confessing
to
herself
that
her
life
had
been
very
vain
it
was
only
when
her
eyes
rested
on
dorothy
and
she
saw
how
supremely
happy
was
the
one
person
whom
she
had
taken
most
closely
to
her
heart
that
she
could
feel
that
she
had
done
anything
that
should
not
have
been
left
undone
i
think
i
sit
down
now
dorothy
she
said
or
i
be
able
to
be
with
you
do
aunt
everything
is
all
ready
and
nobody
will
be
here
for
an
hour
yet
nothing
can
be
nicer
than
the
rooms
and
nothing
ever
was
done
so
well
before
i
only
thinking
how
lonely
you
be
when
we
gone
it
be
only
for
six
weeks
but
six
weeks
is
such
a
long
time
what
would
it
have
been
if
he
had
taken
you
up
to
london
my
pet
are
you
sure
your
mother
would
like
a
fire
in
her
room
dorothy
a
fire
in
september
aunt
people
live
so
differently
one
never
knows
they
never
have
but
one
fire
at
nuncombe
aunt
summer
or
winter
that
no
reason
they
should
be
comfortable
here
however
she
did
not
insist
on
having
the
fire
lighted
stanbury
and
priscilla
came
first
and
the
meeting
was
certainly
very
uncomfortable
poor
stanbury
was
shy
and
could
hardly
speak
a
word
miss
stanbury
thought
that
her
visitor
was
haughty
and
though
she
endeavoured
to
be
gracious
did
it
with
a
struggle
they
called
each
other
which
made
dorothy
uneasy
each
of
them
was
so
dear
to
her
that
it
was
a
pity
that
they
should
glower
at
each
other
like
enemies
priscilla
was
not
at
all
shy
but
she
was
combative
and
as
her
aunt
said
of
her
afterwards
would
not
keep
her
prickles
in
i
hope
priscilla
you
like
weddings
said
miss
stanbury
to
her
not
knowing
where
to
find
a
subject
for
conversation
in
the
abstract
i
like
them
said
priscilla
miss
stanbury
did
not
know
what
her
niece
meant
by
liking
weddings
in
the
abstract
and
was
angry
i
suppose
you
do
have
weddings
at
nuncombe
putney
sometimes
she
said
i
hope
they
do
said
priscilla
but
i
never
saw
one
will
be
my
first
experience
your
own
will
come
next
my
dear
said
miss
stanbury
i
think
not
said
priscilla
it
is
quite
as
likely
to
be
yours
aunt
this
miss
stanbury
thought
was
almost
an
insult
and
she
said
nothing
more
on
the
occasion
then
came
hugh
and
the
bridegroom
the
bridegroom
as
a
matter
of
course
was
not
accommodated
in
the
house
but
he
was
allowed
to
come
there
for
his
tea
he
and
hugh
had
come
together
and
for
hugh
a
had
been
provided
his
aunt
had
not
seen
him
since
he
had
been
turned
out
of
the
house
because
of
his
bad
practices
and
dorothy
had
anticipated
the
meeting
between
them
with
alarm
it
was
however
much
more
pleasant
than
had
been
that
between
the
ladies
hugh
she
said
stiffly
i
am
glad
to
see
you
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
aunt
he
said
i
am
glad
of
any
occasion
that
can
get
me
an
entrance
once
more
into
the
dear
old
house
i
am
so
pleased
to
see
you
she
allowed
her
hand
to
remain
in
his
a
few
moments
and
murmured
something
which
was
intended
to
signify
her
satisfaction
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
be
married
myself
to
one
of
the
dearest
sweetest
and
loveliest
girls
that
ever
were
seen
and
you
must
congratulate
me
i
do
i
do
and
i
hope
you
may
be
happy
we
mean
to
try
to
be
and
some
day
you
must
let
me
bring
her
to
you
and
shew
her
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
if
you
do
not
know
my
wife
she
told
martha
afterwards
that
she
hoped
that
hugh
had
sown
his
wild
oats
and
that
matrimony
would
sober
him
when
however
martha
remarked
that
she
believed
hugh
to
be
as
hardworking
a
young
man
as
any
in
london
miss
stanbury
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
things
were
being
very
much
changed
with
her
but
not
even
yet
was
she
to
be
brought
to
approve
of
work
done
on
behalf
of
a
penny
newspaper
on
the
following
morning
at
ten
there
was
a
procession
from
miss
stanbury
house
into
the
cathedral
which
was
made
entirely
on
foot
indeed
no
assistance
could
have
been
given
by
any
carriage
for
there
is
a
back
entrance
to
the
cathedral
near
to
the
lady
chapel
exactly
opposite
miss
stanbury
house
there
were
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
close
there
to
see
the
procession
and
the
cathedral
bells
rang
out
their
peals
very
merrily
brooke
the
bridegroom
gave
his
arm
to
miss
stanbury
which
was
no
doubt
very
improper
as
he
should
have
appeared
in
the
church
as
coming
from
quite
some
different
part
of
the
world
then
came
the
bride
hanging
on
her
brother
then
two
bridesmaids
friends
of
dorothy
living
in
the
town
and
lastly
priscilla
with
her
mother
for
nothing
would
induce
priscilla
to
take
the
part
of
a
bridesmaid
you
might
as
well
ask
an
owl
to
sing
to
you
she
said
and
then
all
the
frippery
would
be
thrown
away
upon
me
but
she
stood
close
to
dorothy
and
when
the
ceremony
had
been
performed
was
the
first
after
brooke
to
kiss
her
everybody
acknowledged
that
the
bride
was
a
winsome
bride
machugh
was
at
the
breakfast
and
declared
afterwards
that
dorothy
burgess
as
she
then
was
pleased
to
call
her
was
a
girl
very
hard
to
be
understood
she
came
here
said
machugh
two
years
ago
a
plain
silent
shy
dowdy
young
woman
and
we
all
said
that
miss
stanbury
would
be
tired
of
her
in
a
week
there
has
never
come
a
time
in
which
there
was
any
visible
difference
in
her
and
now
she
is
one
of
our
city
beauties
with
plenty
to
say
to
everybody
with
a
fortune
in
one
pocket
and
her
aunt
in
the
other
and
everybody
is
saying
what
a
fortunate
fellow
brooke
burgess
is
to
get
her
in
a
year
or
two
she
be
at
the
top
of
everything
in
the
city
and
will
make
her
way
in
the
county
too
the
compiler
of
this
history
begs
to
add
his
opinion
to
that
of
everybody
as
quoted
above
by
machugh
he
thinks
that
brooke
burgess
was
a
very
fortunate
fellow
to
get
his
wife
chapter
xcviii
acquitted
during
this
time
while
hugh
was
sitting
with
his
love
under
the
oak
trees
at
monkhams
and
dorothy
was
being
converted
into
brooke
burgess
in
exeter
cathedral
trevelyan
was
living
with
her
husband
in
the
cottage
at
twickenham
her
life
was
dreary
enough
and
there
was
but
very
little
of
hope
in
it
to
make
its
dreariness
supportable
as
often
happens
in
periods
of
sickness
the
single
friend
who
could
now
be
of
service
to
the
one
or
to
the
other
was
the
doctor
he
came
daily
to
them
and
with
that
quick
growth
of
confidence
which
medical
kindness
always
inspires
trevelyan
told
to
this
gentleman
all
the
history
of
his
married
life
and
all
that
trevelyan
told
to
him
he
repeated
to
trevelyan
wife
it
may
therefore
be
understood
that
trevelyan
between
them
was
treated
like
a
child
nevill
had
soon
been
able
to
tell
trevelyan
that
her
husband
health
had
been
so
shattered
as
to
make
it
improbable
that
he
should
ever
again
be
strong
either
in
body
or
in
mind
he
would
not
admit
even
when
treating
his
patient
like
a
child
that
he
had
ever
been
mad
and
spoke
of
sir
marmaduke
threat
as
unfortunate
but
what
could
papa
have
done
asked
the
wife
it
is
often
no
doubt
difficult
to
know
what
to
do
but
threats
are
seldom
of
avail
to
bring
a
man
back
to
reason
your
father
was
angry
with
him
and
yet
declared
that
he
was
mad
that
in
itself
was
hardly
rational
one
does
not
become
angry
with
a
madman
one
does
not
become
angry
with
a
madman
but
while
a
man
has
power
in
his
hands
over
others
and
when
he
misuses
that
power
grossly
and
cruelly
who
is
there
that
will
not
be
angry
the
misery
of
the
insane
more
thoroughly
excites
our
pity
than
any
other
suffering
to
which
humanity
is
subject
but
it
is
necessary
that
the
madness
should
be
acknowledged
to
be
madness
before
the
pity
can
be
felt
one
can
forgive
or
at
any
rate
make
excuses
for
any
injury
when
it
is
done
but
it
is
almost
beyond
human
nature
to
forgive
an
injury
when
it
is
let
the
condition
of
the
doer
be
what
it
may
emily
trevelyan
at
this
time
suffered
infinitely
she
was
still
willing
to
yield
in
all
things
possible
because
her
husband
was
ill
because
perhaps
he
was
dying
but
she
could
no
longer
satisfy
herself
with
thinking
that
all
that
she
admitted
all
that
she
was
still
ready
to
admit
had
been
conceded
in
order
that
her
concessions
might
tend
to
soften
the
afflictions
of
one
whose
reason
was
gone
nevill
said
that
her
husband
was
not
mad
and
indeed
trevelyan
seemed
now
to
be
so
clear
in
his
mind
that
she
could
not
doubt
what
the
doctor
said
to
her
she
could
not
think
that
he
was
mad
and
yet
he
spoke
of
the
last
two
years
as
though
he
had
suffered
from
her
almost
all
that
a
husband
could
suffer
from
a
wife
misconduct
she
was
in
doubt
about
his
health
he
may
recover
the
doctor
said
but
he
is
so
weak
that
the
slightest
additional
ailment
would
take
him
off
at
this
time
trevelyan
could
not
raise
himself
from
his
bed
and
was
carried
like
a
child
from
one
room
to
another
he
could
eat
nothing
solid
and
believed
himself
to
be
dying
in
spite
of
his
weakness
and
of
his
savage
memories
in
regard
to
the
past
he
treated
his
wife
on
all
ordinary
subjects
with
consideration
he
spoke
much
of
his
money
telling
her
that
he
had
not
altered
and
would
not
alter
the
will
that
he
had
made
immediately
on
his
marriage
under
that
will
all
his
property
would
be
hers
for
her
life
and
would
go
to
their
child
when
she
was
dead
to
her
this
will
was
more
than
just
it
was
generous
in
the
confidence
which
it
placed
in
her
and
he
told
his
lawyer
in
her
presence
that
to
the
best
of
his
judgment
he
need
not
change
it
but
still
there
passed
hardly
a
day
in
which
he
did
not
make
some
allusion
to
the
great
wrong
which
he
had
endured
throwing
in
her
teeth
the
confessions
which
she
had
made
and
almost
accusing
her
of
that
which
she
certainly
never
had
confessed
even
when
in
the
extremity
of
her
misery
at
casalunga
she
had
thought
that
it
little
mattered
what
she
said
so
that
for
the
moment
he
might
be
appeased
if
he
died
was
he
to
die
in
this
belief
if
he
lived
was
he
to
live
in
this
belief
and
if
he
did
so
believe
was
it
possible
that
he
should
still
trust
her
with
his
money
and
with
his
child
emily
he
said
one
day
it
has
been
a
terrible
tragedy
has
it
not
she
did
not
answer
his
question
sitting
silent
as
it
was
her
custom
to
do
when
he
addressed
her
after
such
fashion
as
this
at
such
times
she
would
not
answer
him
but
she
knew
that
he
would
press
her
for
an
answer
i
blame
him
more
than
i
do
you
continued
trevelyan
infinitely
more
he
was
a
serpent
intending
to
sting
me
from
the
first
not
knowing
perhaps
how
deep
the
sting
would
go
there
was
no
question
in
this
and
the
assertion
was
one
which
had
been
made
so
often
that
she
could
let
it
pass
you
are
young
emily
and
it
may
be
that
you
will
marry
again
never
she
said
with
a
shudder
it
seemed
to
her
then
that
marriage
was
so
fearful
a
thing
that
certainly
she
could
never
venture
upon
it
again
all
i
ask
of
you
is
that
should
you
do
so
you
will
be
more
careful
of
your
husband
honour
louis
she
said
getting
up
and
standing
close
to
him
tell
me
what
it
is
that
you
mean
it
was
now
his
turn
to
remain
silent
and
hers
to
demand
an
answer
i
have
borne
much
she
continued
because
i
would
not
vex
you
in
your
illness
you
have
borne
much
indeed
and
indeed
yes
what
woman
has
ever
borne
more
and
i
said
he
dear
louis
let
us
understand
each
other
at
last
of
what
do
you
accuse
me
let
us
at
any
rate
know
each
other
thoughts
on
this
matter
of
which
each
of
us
is
ever
thinking
i
make
no
new
accusation
i
must
protest
then
against
your
using
words
which
seem
to
convey
accusation
since
marriages
were
first
known
upon
earth
no
woman
has
ever
been
truer
to
her
husband
than
i
have
been
to
you
were
you
lying
to
me
then
at
casalunga
when
you
acknowledged
that
you
had
been
false
to
your
duties
if
i
acknowledged
that
i
did
lie
i
never
said
that
but
yet
i
did
lie
believing
it
to
be
best
for
you
that
i
should
do
so
for
your
honour
sake
for
the
child
sake
weak
as
you
are
louis
i
must
protest
that
it
was
so
i
have
never
injured
you
by
deed
or
thought
and
yet
you
have
lied
to
me
is
a
lie
no
injury
and
such
a
lie
emily
why
did
you
lie
to
me
you
will
tell
me
that
you
never
lied
and
never
owned
that
you
had
lied
though
it
should
kill
him
she
must
tell
him
the
truth
now
you
were
very
ill
at
casalunga
she
said
after
a
pause
but
not
so
ill
as
i
am
now
i
could
breathe
that
air
i
could
live
there
had
i
remained
i
should
have
been
well
now
but
what
of
that
louis
you
were
dying
there
pray
pray
listen
to
me
we
thought
that
you
were
dying
and
we
knew
also
that
you
would
be
taken
from
that
house
that
was
my
affair
do
you
mean
that
i
could
not
keep
a
house
over
my
head
at
this
moment
he
was
half
lying
half
sitting
in
a
large
easy
chair
in
the
little
of
their
cottage
to
which
he
had
been
carried
from
the
adjoining
when
not
excited
he
would
sit
for
hours
without
moving
gazing
through
the
open
window
sometimes
with
some
pretext
of
a
book
lying
within
the
reach
of
his
hand
but
almost
without
strength
to
lift
it
and
certainly
without
power
to
read
it
but
now
he
had
worked
himself
up
to
so
much
energy
that
he
almost
raised
himself
up
in
his
chair
as
he
turned
towards
his
wife
had
i
not
the
world
before
me
to
choose
a
house
in
they
would
have
put
you
somewhere
and
i
could
not
have
reached
you
in
a
madhouse
you
mean
yes
if
you
had
told
them
will
you
listen
dear
louis
we
knew
that
it
was
our
duty
to
bring
you
home
and
as
you
would
not
let
me
come
to
you
and
serve
you
and
assist
you
to
come
here
where
you
are
safe
unless
i
owned
that
you
had
been
right
i
said
that
you
had
been
right
and
it
was
a
lie
you
say
now
all
that
is
nothing
i
can
not
go
through
it
nor
should
you
there
is
the
only
question
you
do
not
think
that
i
have
been
i
need
not
say
the
thing
you
do
not
think
that
as
she
asked
the
question
she
knelt
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
kissed
it
say
that
you
do
not
think
that
and
i
will
never
trouble
you
further
about
the
past
yes
that
is
it
you
will
never
trouble
me
she
glanced
up
into
his
face
and
saw
there
the
old
look
which
he
used
to
wear
when
he
was
at
willesden
and
at
casalunga
and
there
had
come
again
the
old
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
to
her
in
the
bitterness
of
his
wrath
the
look
and
the
tone
which
had
made
her
sure
that
he
was
a
madman
the
craft
and
subtlety
of
women
passes
everything
he
said
and
so
at
last
i
am
to
tell
you
that
from
the
beginning
it
has
been
my
doing
i
will
never
say
so
though
i
should
die
in
refusing
to
do
it
after
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
further
conversation
for
there
came
upon
him
a
fit
of
coughing
and
then
he
swooned
and
in
he
was
in
bed
and
nevill
was
by
his
side
you
must
not
speak
to
him
at
all
on
this
matter
said
the
doctor
but
if
he
speaks
to
me
she
asked
let
it
pass
said
the
doctor
let
the
subject
be
got
rid
of
with
as
much
ease
as
you
can
he
is
very
ill
now
and
even
this
might
have
killed
him
nevertheless
though
this
seemed
to
be
stern
nevill
was
very
kind
to
her
declaring
that
the
hallucination
in
her
husband
mind
did
not
really
consist
of
a
belief
in
her
infidelity
but
arose
from
an
obstinate
determination
to
yield
nothing
he
does
not
believe
it
but
he
feels
that
were
he
to
say
as
much
his
hands
would
be
weakened
and
yours
strengthened
can
he
then
be
in
his
sane
mind
in
one
sense
all
misconduct
is
proof
of
insanity
said
the
doctor
in
his
case
the
weakness
of
the
mind
has
been
consequent
upon
the
weakness
of
the
body
three
days
after
that
nora
visited
twickenham
from
monkhams
in
obedience
to
a
telegram
from
her
sister
louis
she
said
had
become
so
much
weaker
that
she
hardly
dared
to
be
alone
with
him
would
nora
come
to
her
nora
came
of
course
and
hugh
met
her
at
the
station
and
brought
her
with
him
to
the
cottage
he
asked
whether
he
might
see
trevelyan
but
was
told
that
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
not
he
had
been
almost
continually
silent
since
the
last
dispute
which
he
had
with
his
wife
but
he
had
given
little
signs
that
he
was
always
thinking
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
brought
home
by
her
from
italy
and
of
the
story
she
had
told
him
of
her
mode
of
inducing
him
to
come
hugh
stanbury
had
been
her
partner
in
that
struggle
and
would
probably
be
received
if
not
with
sullen
silence
then
with
some
attempt
at
rebuke
but
hugh
did
see
nevill
and
learned
from
him
that
it
was
hardly
possible
that
trevelyan
should
live
many
hours
he
has
worn
himself
out
said
the
doctor
and
there
is
nothing
left
in
him
by
which
he
can
lay
hold
of
life
again
of
nora
her
took
but
little
notice
and
never
again
referred
in
her
hearing
to
the
great
trouble
of
his
life
he
said
to
her
a
word
or
two
about
monkhams
and
asked
a
question
now
and
again
as
to
lord
peterborough
whom
however
he
always
called
glascock
but
hugh
stanbury
name
was
never
mentioned
by
him
there
was
a
feeling
in
his
mind
that
at
the
very
last
he
had
been
duped
in
being
brought
to
england
and
that
stanbury
had
assisted
in
the
deception
to
his
wife
he
would
whisper
little
petulant
regrets
for
the
loss
of
the
comforts
of
casalunga
and
would
speak
of
the
air
of
italy
and
of
italian
skies
and
of
the
italian
sun
as
though
he
had
enjoyed
at
his
sienese
villa
all
the
luxuries
which
climate
can
give
and
would
have
enjoyed
them
still
had
he
been
allowed
to
remain
there
to
all
this
she
would
say
nothing
she
knew
now
that
he
was
failing
quickly
and
there
was
only
one
subject
on
which
she
either
feared
or
hoped
to
hear
him
speak
before
he
left
her
for
ever
and
ever
would
he
tell
her
that
he
had
not
doubted
her
faith
she
had
long
discussions
with
nora
on
the
matter
as
though
all
the
future
of
her
life
depended
on
it
it
was
in
vain
that
nora
tried
to
make
her
understand
that
if
hereafter
the
spirit
of
her
husband
could
know
anything
of
the
troubles
of
his
mortal
life
could
ever
look
back
to
the
things
which
he
had
done
in
the
flesh
then
would
he
certainly
know
the
truth
and
all
suspicion
would
be
at
an
end
and
if
not
if
there
was
to
be
no
such
retrospect
what
did
it
matter
now
for
these
few
last
hours
before
the
coil
should
be
shaken
off
and
all
doubt
and
all
sorrow
should
be
at
an
end
but
the
wife
who
was
soon
to
be
a
widow
yearned
to
be
acquitted
in
this
world
by
him
to
whom
her
guilt
or
her
innocence
had
been
matter
of
such
vital
importance
he
has
never
thought
it
said
nora
but
if
he
would
say
so
if
he
would
only
look
it
it
will
be
all
in
all
to
me
as
long
as
i
live
in
this
world
and
then
though
they
had
determined
between
themselves
in
spoken
words
never
to
regard
him
again
as
one
who
had
been
mad
in
all
their
thoughts
and
actions
towards
him
they
treated
him
as
though
he
were
less
responsible
than
an
infant
and
he
was
mad
mad
though
every
doctor
in
england
had
called
him
sane
had
he
not
been
mad
he
must
have
been
a
fiend
or
he
could
not
have
tortured
as
he
had
done
the
woman
to
whom
he
owed
the
closest
protection
which
one
human
being
can
give
to
another
during
these
last
days
and
nights
she
never
left
him
she
had
done
her
duty
to
him
well
at
any
rate
since
the
time
when
she
had
been
enabled
to
come
near
him
in
italy
it
may
be
that
in
the
first
days
of
their
quarrel
she
had
not
been
regardful
as
she
should
have
been
of
a
husband
will
that
she
might
have
escaped
this
tragedy
by
submitting
herself
to
the
man
wishes
as
she
had
always
been
ready
to
submit
herself
to
his
words
had
she
been
able
always
to
keep
her
neck
in
the
dust
under
his
foot
their
married
life
might
have
been
passed
without
outward
calamity
and
it
is
possible
that
he
might
still
have
lived
but
if
she
erred
surely
she
had
been
scourged
for
her
error
with
scorpions
as
she
sat
at
his
bedside
watching
him
she
thought
of
her
wasted
youth
of
her
faded
beauty
of
her
shattered
happiness
of
her
fallen
hopes
she
had
still
her
child
but
she
felt
towards
him
that
she
herself
was
so
sad
a
creature
so
sombre
so
dark
so
necessarily
wretched
from
this
time
forth
till
the
day
of
her
death
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
boy
that
she
should
never
be
with
him
there
could
be
nothing
left
for
her
but
garments
dark
with
woe
eyes
red
with
weeping
hours
sad
from
solitude
thoughts
weary
with
memory
and
even
yet
if
he
would
only
now
say
that
he
did
not
believe
her
to
have
been
guilty
how
great
would
be
the
change
in
her
future
life
then
came
an
evening
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
somewhat
stronger
than
he
had
been
he
had
taken
some
refreshment
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
and
stimulated
by
its
strength
had
spoken
a
word
or
two
both
to
nora
and
to
his
wife
his
words
had
been
of
no
especial
interest
alluding
to
some
small
detail
of
his
own
condition
such
as
are
generally
the
chosen
topics
of
conversation
with
invalids
but
he
had
been
pronounced
to
be
better
and
nora
spoke
to
him
cheerfully
when
he
was
taken
into
the
next
room
by
the
man
who
was
always
at
hand
to
move
him
his
wife
followed
him
and
soon
afterwards
returned
and
bade
nora
good
night
she
would
sit
by
her
husband
and
nora
was
to
go
to
the
room
below
that
she
might
receive
her
lover
there
he
was
expected
out
that
evening
but
trevelyan
said
that
she
would
not
see
him
hugh
came
and
went
and
nora
took
herself
to
her
chamber
the
hours
of
the
night
went
on
and
trevelyan
was
still
sitting
by
her
husband
bed
it
was
still
september
and
the
weather
was
very
warm
but
the
windows
had
been
all
closed
since
an
hour
before
sunset
she
was
sitting
there
thinking
thinking
thinking
nevill
had
told
her
that
the
time
now
was
very
near
she
was
not
thinking
now
how
very
near
it
might
be
but
whether
there
might
yet
be
time
for
him
to
say
that
one
word
to
her
emily
he
said
in
the
lowest
whisper
darling
she
answered
turning
round
and
touching
him
with
her
hand
my
feet
are
cold
there
are
no
clothes
on
them
she
took
a
thick
shawl
and
spread
it
double
across
the
bottom
of
the
bed
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
though
it
was
clammy
with
perspiration
it
was
chill
and
she
brought
the
warm
clothes
up
close
round
his
shoulders
i
ca
sleep
he
said
if
i
could
sleep
i
should
mind
then
he
was
silent
again
and
her
thoughts
went
harping
on
still
on
the
same
subject
she
told
herself
that
if
ever
that
act
of
justice
were
to
be
done
for
her
it
must
be
done
that
night
after
a
while
she
turned
round
over
him
ever
so
gently
and
saw
that
his
large
eyes
were
open
and
fixed
upon
the
wall
she
was
kneeling
now
on
the
chair
close
by
the
bed
head
and
her
hand
was
on
the
rail
of
the
bedstead
supporting
her
louis
she
said
ever
so
softly
well
can
you
say
one
word
for
your
wife
dear
dear
dearest
husband
what
word
i
have
not
been
a
harlot
to
you
have
i
what
name
is
that
but
what
a
thing
louis
kiss
my
hand
louis
if
you
believe
me
and
very
gently
she
laid
the
tips
of
her
fingers
on
his
lips
for
a
moment
or
two
she
waited
and
the
kiss
did
not
come
would
he
spare
her
in
this
the
last
moment
left
to
him
either
for
justice
or
for
mercy
for
a
moment
or
two
the
bitterness
of
her
despair
was
almost
unendurable
she
had
time
to
think
that
were
she
once
to
withdraw
her
hand
she
would
be
condemned
for
ever
and
that
it
must
be
withdrawn
but
at
length
the
lips
moved
and
with
struggling
ear
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
tongue
within
and
the
verdict
of
the
dying
man
had
been
given
in
her
favour
he
never
spoke
a
word
more
either
to
annul
it
or
to
enforce
it
some
time
after
that
she
crept
into
nora
room
nora
she
said
waking
the
sleeping
girl
it
is
all
over
is
he
dead
it
is
all
over
richards
is
there
it
is
better
than
an
hour
since
now
let
me
come
in
she
got
into
her
sister
bed
and
there
she
told
the
tale
of
her
tardy
triumph
he
declared
to
me
at
last
that
he
trusted
me
she
said
almost
believing
that
real
words
had
come
from
his
lips
to
that
effect
then
she
fell
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
after
a
while
she
also
slept
chapter
xcix
conclusion
at
last
the
maniac
was
dead
and
in
his
last
moments
he
had
made
such
reparation
as
was
in
his
power
for
the
evil
that
he
had
done
with
that
slight
touch
of
his
dry
fevered
lips
he
had
made
the
assertion
on
which
was
to
depend
the
future
peace
and
comfort
of
the
woman
whom
he
had
so
cruelly
misused
to
her
mind
the
acquittal
was
perfect
but
she
never
explained
to
human
ears
not
even
to
those
of
her
sister
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
given
her
life
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
with
it
has
been
told
for
the
rest
it
can
not
be
but
that
it
should
be
better
than
that
which
was
passed
if
there
be
any
retribution
for
such
sufferings
in
money
liberty
and
outward
comfort
such
retribution
she
possessed
for
all
that
had
been
his
was
now
hers
he
had
once
suggested
what
she
should
do
were
she
ever
to
be
married
again
and
she
felt
that
of
such
a
career
there
could
be
no
possibility
anything
but
that
we
all
know
that
practices
in
this
matter
do
not
always
tally
with
wives
vows
but
as
regards
trevelyan
we
are
disposed
to
think
that
the
promise
will
be
kept
she
has
her
child
and
he
will
give
her
sufficient
interest
to
make
life
worth
having
early
in
the
following
spring
hugh
stanbury
was
married
to
nora
rowley
in
the
parish
church
of
monkhams
at
which
place
by
that
time
nora
found
herself
to
be
almost
as
much
at
home
as
she
might
have
been
under
other
circumstances
they
had
prayed
that
the
marriage
might
be
very
private
but
when
the
day
arrived
there
was
no
very
close
privacy
the
parish
church
was
quite
full
there
were
bridesmaids
there
was
a
great
breakfast
crutch
had
a
new
brown
silk
gown
given
to
her
there
was
a
long
article
in
the
county
gazette
and
there
were
short
paragraphs
in
various
metropolitan
newspapers
it
was
generally
thought
among
his
compeers
that
hugh
stanbury
had
married
into
the
aristocracy
and
that
the
fact
was
a
triumph
for
the
profession
to
which
he
belonged
it
shewed
what
a
bohemian
could
do
and
that
men
of
the
press
in
england
might
gradually
hope
to
force
their
way
almost
anywhere
so
great
was
the
name
of
monkhams
he
and
his
wife
took
for
themselves
a
very
small
house
near
the
regent
park
at
which
they
intend
to
remain
until
hugh
shall
have
enabled
himself
to
earn
an
additional
two
hundred
trevelyan
did
not
come
to
live
with
them
but
kept
the
cottage
near
the
river
at
twickenham
hugh
stanbury
was
very
averse
to
any
protracted
connection
with
comforts
to
be
obtained
from
poor
trevelyan
income
and
told
nora
that
he
must
hold
her
to
her
promise
about
the
in
the
cupboard
it
is
our
opinion
that
and
hugh
stanbury
will
never
want
for
a
and
all
comfortable
additions
until
the
inhabitants
of
london
shall
cease
to
require
newspapers
on
their
breakfast
tables
brooke
and
brooke
established
themselves
in
the
house
in
the
close
on
their
return
from
their
wedding
tour
and
brooke
at
once
put
himself
into
intimate
relations
with
the
croppers
taking
his
fair
share
of
the
bank
work
dorothy
was
absolutely
installed
as
mistress
in
her
aunt
house
with
many
wonderful
ceremonies
with
the
unlocking
of
cupboards
the
outpouring
of
stores
the
giving
up
of
keys
and
with
many
speeches
made
to
martha
this
was
all
very
painful
to
dorothy
who
could
not
bring
herself
to
suppose
it
possible
that
she
should
be
the
mistress
of
that
house
during
her
aunt
life
miss
stanbury
however
of
course
persevered
speaking
of
herself
as
a
old
woman
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
who
would
soon
be
carried
away
and
put
out
of
sight
but
in
a
very
few
days
things
got
back
into
their
places
and
aunt
stanbury
had
the
keys
again
i
knew
how
it
would
be
miss
said
martha
to
her
young
mistress
and
i
did
say
nothing
you
understand
her
so
well
stanbury
and
priscilla
still
live
at
the
cottage
which
however
to
priscilla
great
disgust
has
been
considerably
improved
and
prettily
furnished
this
was
done
under
the
auspices
of
hugh
but
with
funds
chiefly
supplied
from
the
house
of
brooke
dorothy
and
priscilla
comes
into
exeter
to
see
her
sister
perhaps
every
other
week
but
will
never
sleep
away
from
home
and
very
rarely
will
eat
or
drink
at
her
sister
table
i
do
know
why
i
do
she
said
to
dorothy
but
somehow
it
puts
me
out
it
delays
me
in
my
efforts
to
come
to
the
straw
a
day
nevertheless
the
sisters
are
dear
friends
i
fear
that
in
some
previous
number
a
half
promise
was
made
that
a
husband
should
be
found
for
camilla
french
that
can
not
be
treated
in
the
manner
in
which
any
whole
promise
certainly
would
have
been
handled
there
is
no
husband
ready
for
cammy
french
the
reader
however
will
be
delighted
to
know
that
she
made
up
her
quarrel
with
her
sister
and
gibson
and
is
now
rather
fond
of
being
a
guest
at
gibson
house
on
her
first
return
to
exeter
after
the
gibsons
had
come
back
from
their
little
cornish
rustication
camilla
declared
that
she
could
not
and
would
not
bring
herself
to
endure
a
certain
dress
of
which
bella
was
very
fond
and
as
this
dress
had
been
bought
for
camilla
with
special
reference
to
the
glories
of
her
anticipated
married
life
this
objection
was
almost
natural
but
bella
treated
it
as
absurd
and
camilla
at
last
gave
way
it
need
only
further
be
said
that
though
giles
hickbody
and
martha
are
not
actually
married
as
yet
men
and
women
in
their
class
of
life
always
moving
towards
marriage
with
great
precaution
it
is
quite
understood
that
the
young
people
are
engaged
and
are
to
be
made
happy
together
at
some
future
time
