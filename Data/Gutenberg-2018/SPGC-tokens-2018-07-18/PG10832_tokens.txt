carnacki
the
ghost
finder
by
william
hope
hodgson
no
the
gateway
of
the
monster
in
response
to
carnacki
usual
card
of
invitation
to
have
dinner
and
listen
to
a
story
i
arrived
promptly
at
cheyne
walk
to
find
the
three
others
who
were
always
invited
to
these
happy
little
times
there
before
me
five
minutes
later
carnacki
arkright
jessop
taylor
and
i
were
all
engaged
in
the
pleasant
occupation
of
dining
you
not
been
long
away
this
time
i
remarked
as
i
finished
my
soup
forgetting
momentarily
carnacki
dislike
of
being
asked
even
to
skirt
the
borders
of
his
story
until
such
time
as
he
was
ready
then
he
would
not
stint
words
that
all
he
replied
with
brevity
and
i
changed
the
subject
remarking
that
i
had
been
buying
a
new
gun
to
which
piece
of
news
he
gave
an
intelligent
nod
and
a
smile
which
i
think
showed
a
genuinely
appreciation
of
my
intentional
changing
of
the
conversation
later
when
dinner
was
finished
carnacki
snugged
himself
comfortably
down
in
his
big
chair
along
with
his
pipe
and
began
his
story
with
very
little
circumlocution
as
dodgson
was
remarking
just
now
i
only
been
away
a
short
time
and
for
a
very
good
reason
too
i
only
been
away
a
short
distance
the
exact
locality
i
am
afraid
i
must
not
tell
you
but
it
is
less
than
twenty
miles
from
here
though
except
for
changing
a
name
that
spoil
the
story
and
it
is
a
story
too
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
things
ever
i
have
run
against
i
received
a
letter
a
fortnight
ago
from
a
man
i
must
call
anderson
asking
for
an
appointment
i
arranged
a
time
and
when
he
came
i
found
that
he
wished
me
to
investigate
and
see
whether
i
could
not
clear
up
a
and
well
too
well
authenticated
case
of
what
he
termed
he
gave
me
very
full
particulars
and
finally
as
the
case
seemed
to
present
something
unique
i
decided
to
take
it
up
two
days
later
i
drove
to
the
house
late
in
the
afternoon
i
found
it
a
very
old
place
standing
quite
alone
in
its
own
grounds
anderson
had
left
a
letter
with
the
butler
i
found
pleading
excuses
for
his
absence
and
leaving
the
whole
house
at
my
disposal
for
my
investigations
the
butler
evidently
knew
the
object
of
my
visit
and
i
questioned
him
pretty
thoroughly
during
dinner
which
i
had
in
rather
lonely
state
he
is
an
old
and
privileged
servant
and
had
the
history
of
the
grey
room
exact
in
detail
from
him
i
learned
more
particulars
regarding
two
things
that
anderson
had
mentioned
in
but
a
casual
manner
the
first
was
that
the
door
of
the
grey
room
would
be
heard
in
the
dead
of
night
to
open
and
slam
heavily
and
this
even
though
the
butler
knew
it
was
locked
and
the
key
on
the
bunch
in
his
pantry
the
second
was
that
the
bedclothes
would
always
be
found
torn
off
the
bed
and
hurled
in
a
heap
into
a
corner
but
it
was
the
door
slamming
that
chiefly
bothered
the
old
butler
many
and
many
a
time
he
told
me
had
he
lain
awake
and
just
got
shivering
with
fright
listening
for
sometimes
the
door
would
be
slammed
time
after
time
thud
thud
thud
so
that
sleep
was
impossible
from
anderson
i
knew
already
that
the
room
had
a
history
extending
back
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
three
people
had
been
strangled
in
it
an
ancestor
of
his
and
his
wife
and
child
this
is
authentic
as
i
had
taken
very
great
pains
to
discover
so
that
you
can
imagine
it
was
with
a
feeling
i
had
a
striking
case
to
investigate
that
i
went
upstairs
after
dinner
to
have
a
look
at
the
grey
room
peter
the
old
butler
was
in
rather
a
state
about
my
going
and
assured
me
with
much
solemnity
that
in
all
the
twenty
years
of
his
service
no
one
had
ever
entered
that
room
after
nightfall
he
begged
me
in
quite
a
fatherly
way
to
wait
till
the
morning
when
there
would
be
no
danger
and
then
he
could
accompany
me
himself
of
course
i
smiled
a
little
at
him
and
told
him
not
to
bother
i
explained
that
i
should
do
no
more
than
look
a
bit
and
perhaps
affix
a
few
seals
he
need
not
fear
i
was
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
but
he
shook
his
head
when
i
said
that
is
many
ghosts
like
ours
sir
he
assured
me
with
mournful
pride
and
by
jove
he
was
right
as
you
will
see
i
took
a
couple
of
candles
and
peter
followed
with
his
bunch
of
keys
he
unlocked
the
door
but
would
not
come
inside
with
me
he
was
evidently
in
a
fright
and
he
renewed
his
request
that
i
would
put
off
my
examination
until
daylight
of
course
i
laughed
at
him
again
and
told
him
he
could
stand
sentry
at
the
door
and
catch
anything
that
came
out
never
comes
outside
sir
he
said
in
his
funny
old
solemn
manner
somehow
he
managed
to
make
me
feel
as
if
i
were
going
to
have
the
right
away
anyway
it
was
one
to
him
you
know
i
left
him
there
and
examined
the
room
it
is
a
big
apartment
and
well
furnished
in
the
grand
style
with
a
huge
which
stands
with
its
head
to
the
end
wall
there
were
two
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
and
two
on
each
of
the
three
tables
that
were
in
the
room
i
lit
the
lot
and
after
that
the
room
felt
a
little
less
inhumanly
dreary
though
mind
you
it
was
quite
fresh
and
well
kept
in
every
way
after
i
had
taken
a
good
look
i
sealed
lengths
of
baby
ribbon
across
the
windows
along
the
walls
over
the
pictures
and
over
the
fireplace
and
the
wall
closets
all
the
time
as
i
worked
the
butler
stood
just
without
the
door
and
i
could
not
persuade
him
to
enter
though
i
jested
him
a
little
as
i
stretched
the
ribbons
and
went
here
and
there
about
my
work
every
now
and
again
he
would
say
excuse
me
i
sure
sir
but
i
do
wish
you
would
come
out
sir
i
fair
in
a
quake
for
you
i
told
him
he
need
not
wait
but
he
was
loyal
enough
in
his
way
to
what
he
considered
his
duty
he
said
he
could
not
go
away
and
leave
me
all
alone
there
he
apologized
but
made
it
very
clear
that
i
did
not
realize
the
danger
of
the
room
and
i
could
see
generally
that
he
was
in
a
pretty
frightened
state
all
the
same
i
had
to
make
the
room
so
that
i
should
know
if
anything
material
entered
it
so
i
asked
him
not
to
bother
me
unless
he
really
heard
or
saw
something
he
was
beginning
to
get
on
my
nerves
and
the
of
the
room
was
bad
enough
without
making
it
any
nastier
for
a
time
further
i
worked
stretching
ribbons
across
the
floor
and
sealing
them
so
that
the
merest
touch
would
have
broken
them
were
anyone
to
venture
into
the
room
in
the
dark
with
the
intention
of
playing
the
fool
all
this
had
taken
me
far
longer
than
i
had
anticipated
and
suddenly
i
heard
a
clock
strike
eleven
i
had
taken
off
my
coat
soon
after
commencing
work
now
however
as
i
had
practically
made
an
end
of
all
that
i
intended
to
do
i
walked
across
to
the
settee
and
picked
it
up
i
was
in
the
act
of
getting
into
it
when
the
old
butler
voice
he
had
not
said
a
word
for
the
last
hour
came
sharp
and
frightened
out
sir
quick
there
something
going
to
happen
jove
but
i
jumped
and
then
in
the
same
moment
one
of
the
candles
on
the
table
to
the
left
went
out
now
whether
it
was
the
wind
or
what
i
do
not
know
but
just
for
a
moment
i
was
enough
startled
to
make
a
run
for
the
door
though
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
pulled
up
before
i
reached
it
i
simply
could
not
bunk
out
with
the
butler
standing
there
after
having
as
it
were
read
him
a
sort
of
lesson
on
brave
so
i
just
turned
right
picked
up
the
two
candles
off
the
mantelpiece
and
walked
across
to
the
table
near
the
bed
well
i
saw
nothing
i
blew
out
the
candle
that
was
still
alight
then
i
went
to
those
on
the
two
tables
and
blew
them
out
then
outside
of
the
door
the
old
man
called
again
sir
do
be
told
do
be
told
right
peter
i
said
and
by
jove
my
voice
was
not
as
steady
as
i
should
have
liked
i
made
for
the
door
and
had
a
bit
of
work
not
to
start
running
i
took
some
thundering
long
strides
as
you
can
imagine
near
the
door
i
had
a
sudden
feeling
that
there
was
a
cold
wind
in
the
room
it
was
almost
as
if
the
window
had
been
suddenly
opened
a
little
i
got
to
the
door
and
the
old
butler
gave
back
a
step
in
a
sort
of
instinctive
way
the
candles
peter
i
said
pretty
sharply
and
shoved
them
into
his
hands
i
turned
and
caught
the
handle
and
slammed
the
door
shut
with
a
crash
somehow
do
you
know
as
i
did
so
i
thought
i
felt
something
pull
back
on
it
but
it
must
have
been
only
fancy
i
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
then
again
the
door
i
felt
easier
then
and
and
sealed
the
door
in
addition
i
put
my
card
over
the
keyhole
and
sealed
it
there
after
which
i
pocketed
the
key
and
went
downstairs
with
peter
who
was
nervous
and
silent
leading
the
way
poor
old
beggar
it
had
not
struck
me
until
that
moment
that
he
had
been
enduring
a
considerable
strain
during
the
last
two
or
three
hours
about
midnight
i
went
to
bed
my
room
lay
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
upon
which
opens
the
door
of
the
grey
room
i
counted
the
doors
between
it
and
mine
and
found
that
five
rooms
lay
between
and
i
am
sure
you
can
understand
that
i
was
not
sorry
then
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
undress
an
idea
came
to
me
and
i
took
my
candle
and
sealing
wax
and
sealed
the
doors
of
all
five
rooms
if
any
door
slammed
in
the
night
i
should
know
just
which
one
i
returned
to
my
room
locked
the
door
and
went
to
bed
i
was
waked
suddenly
from
a
deep
sleep
by
a
loud
crash
somewhere
out
in
the
passage
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
but
heard
nothing
then
i
lit
my
candle
i
was
in
the
very
act
of
lighting
it
when
there
came
the
bang
of
a
door
being
violently
slammed
along
the
corridor
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
got
my
revolver
i
unlocked
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
passage
holding
my
candle
high
and
keeping
the
pistol
ready
then
a
queer
thing
happened
i
could
not
go
a
step
toward
the
grey
room
you
all
know
i
am
not
really
a
cowardly
chap
i
gone
into
too
many
cases
connected
with
ghostly
things
to
be
accused
of
that
but
i
tell
you
i
funked
it
simply
funked
it
just
like
any
blessed
kid
there
was
something
precious
unholy
in
the
air
that
night
i
ran
back
into
my
bedroom
and
shut
and
locked
the
door
then
i
sat
on
the
bed
all
night
and
listened
to
the
dismal
thudding
of
a
door
up
the
corridor
the
sound
seemed
to
echo
through
all
the
house
daylight
came
at
last
and
i
washed
and
dressed
the
door
had
not
slammed
for
about
an
hour
and
i
was
getting
back
my
nerve
again
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
though
in
some
ways
it
was
silly
for
when
meddling
with
that
sort
of
thing
your
nerve
is
bound
to
go
sometimes
and
you
just
have
to
sit
quiet
and
call
yourself
a
coward
until
daylight
sometimes
it
is
more
than
just
cowardice
i
fancy
i
believe
at
times
it
is
something
warning
you
and
fighting
you
but
all
the
same
i
always
feel
mean
and
miserable
after
a
time
like
that
when
the
day
came
properly
i
opened
my
door
and
keeping
my
revolver
handy
went
quietly
along
the
passage
i
had
to
pass
the
head
of
the
stairs
along
the
way
and
who
should
i
see
coming
up
but
the
old
butler
carrying
a
cup
of
coffee
he
had
merely
tucked
his
nightshirt
into
his
trousers
and
he
had
an
old
pair
of
carpet
slippers
on
peter
i
said
feeling
suddenly
cheerful
for
i
was
as
glad
as
any
lost
child
to
have
a
live
human
being
close
to
me
are
you
off
to
with
the
refreshments
the
old
man
gave
a
start
and
slopped
some
of
the
coffee
he
stared
up
at
me
and
i
could
see
that
he
looked
white
and
he
came
on
up
the
stairs
and
held
out
the
little
tray
to
me
very
thankful
indeed
sir
to
see
you
safe
and
well
he
said
feared
one
time
you
might
risk
going
into
the
grey
room
sir
i
lain
awake
all
night
with
the
sound
of
the
door
and
when
it
came
light
i
thought
i
make
you
a
cup
of
coffee
i
knew
you
would
want
to
look
at
the
seals
and
somehow
it
seems
safer
if
there
two
sir
i
said
a
brick
this
is
very
thoughtful
of
you
and
i
drank
the
coffee
along
i
told
him
and
handed
him
back
the
tray
going
to
have
a
look
at
what
the
brutes
have
been
up
to
i
simply
had
the
pluck
to
in
the
night
very
thankful
sir
he
replied
and
blood
can
do
nothing
sir
against
devils
and
that
what
in
the
grey
room
after
dark
i
examined
the
seals
on
all
the
doors
as
i
went
along
and
found
them
right
but
when
i
got
to
the
grey
room
the
seal
was
broken
though
the
card
over
the
keyhole
was
untouched
i
ripped
it
off
and
unlocked
the
door
and
went
in
rather
cautiously
as
you
can
imagine
but
the
whole
room
was
empty
of
anything
to
frighten
one
and
there
was
heaps
of
light
i
examined
all
my
seals
and
not
a
single
one
was
disturbed
the
old
butler
had
followed
me
in
and
suddenly
he
called
out
bedclothes
sir
i
ran
up
to
the
bed
and
looked
over
and
surely
they
were
lying
in
the
corner
to
the
left
of
the
bed
jove
you
can
imagine
how
queer
i
felt
something
been
in
the
room
i
stared
for
a
while
from
the
bed
to
the
clothes
on
the
floor
i
had
a
feeling
that
i
did
not
want
to
touch
either
old
peter
though
did
not
seem
to
be
affected
that
way
he
went
over
to
the
bed
coverings
and
was
going
to
pick
them
up
as
doubtless
he
had
done
every
day
these
twenty
years
back
but
i
stopped
him
i
wanted
nothing
touched
until
i
had
finished
my
examination
this
i
must
have
spent
a
full
hour
over
and
then
i
let
peter
straighten
up
the
bed
after
which
we
went
out
and
i
locked
the
door
for
the
room
was
getting
on
my
nerves
i
had
a
short
walk
and
then
breakfast
after
which
i
felt
more
my
own
man
and
so
returned
to
the
grey
room
and
with
peter
help
and
one
of
the
maids
i
had
everything
taken
out
of
the
room
except
the
bed
even
the
very
pictures
i
examined
the
walls
floor
and
ceiling
then
with
probe
hammer
and
magnifying
glass
but
found
nothing
suspicious
and
i
can
assure
you
i
began
to
realize
in
very
truth
that
some
incredible
thing
had
been
loose
in
the
room
during
the
past
night
i
sealed
up
everything
again
and
went
out
locking
and
sealing
the
door
as
before
after
dinner
peter
and
i
unpacked
some
of
my
stuff
and
i
fixed
up
my
camera
and
flashlight
opposite
to
the
door
of
the
grey
room
with
a
string
from
the
trigger
of
the
flashlight
to
the
door
then
you
see
if
the
door
were
really
opened
the
flashlight
would
blare
out
and
there
would
be
possibly
a
very
queer
picture
to
examine
in
the
morning
the
last
thing
i
did
before
leaving
was
to
uncap
the
lens
and
after
that
i
went
off
to
my
bedroom
and
to
bed
for
i
intended
to
be
up
at
midnight
and
to
ensure
this
i
set
my
little
alarm
to
call
me
also
i
left
my
candle
burning
the
clock
woke
me
at
twelve
and
i
got
up
and
into
my
dressing
gown
and
slippers
i
shoved
my
revolver
into
my
right
and
opened
my
door
then
i
lit
my
darkroom
lamp
and
withdrew
the
slide
so
that
it
would
give
a
clear
light
i
carried
it
up
the
corridor
about
thirty
feet
and
put
it
down
on
the
floor
with
the
open
side
away
from
me
so
that
it
would
show
me
anything
that
might
approach
along
the
dark
passage
then
i
went
back
and
sat
in
the
doorway
of
my
room
with
my
revolver
handy
staring
up
the
passage
toward
the
place
where
i
knew
my
camera
stood
outside
the
door
of
the
grey
room
i
should
think
i
had
watched
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
faint
noise
away
up
the
corridor
i
was
immediately
conscious
of
a
queer
prickling
sensation
about
the
back
of
my
head
and
my
hands
began
to
sweat
a
little
the
following
instant
the
whole
end
of
the
passage
flicked
into
sight
in
the
abrupt
glare
of
the
flashlight
there
came
the
succeeding
darkness
and
i
peered
nervously
up
the
corridor
listening
tensely
and
trying
to
find
what
lay
beyond
the
faint
glow
of
my
which
now
seemed
ridiculously
dim
by
contrast
with
the
tremendous
blaze
of
the
and
then
as
i
stooped
forward
staring
and
listening
there
came
the
crashing
thud
of
the
door
of
the
grey
room
the
sound
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
of
the
large
corridor
and
go
echoing
hollowly
through
the
house
i
tell
you
i
felt
horrible
as
if
my
bones
were
water
simply
beastly
jove
how
i
did
stare
and
how
i
listened
and
then
it
came
again
thud
thud
thud
and
then
a
silence
that
was
almost
worse
than
the
noise
of
the
door
for
i
kept
fancying
that
some
awful
thing
was
stealing
upon
me
along
the
corridor
and
then
suddenly
my
lamp
was
put
out
and
i
could
not
see
a
yard
before
me
i
realized
all
at
once
that
i
was
doing
a
very
silly
thing
sitting
there
and
i
jumped
up
even
as
i
did
so
i
i
heard
a
sound
in
the
passage
and
quite
me
i
made
one
backward
spring
into
my
room
and
slammed
and
locked
the
door
i
sat
on
my
bed
and
stared
at
the
door
i
had
my
revolver
in
my
hand
but
it
seemed
an
abominably
useless
thing
i
felt
that
there
was
something
the
other
side
of
that
door
for
some
unknown
reason
i
it
was
pressed
up
against
the
door
and
it
was
soft
that
was
just
what
i
thought
most
extraordinary
thing
to
think
presently
i
got
hold
of
myself
a
bit
and
marked
out
a
pentacle
hurriedly
with
chalk
on
the
polished
floor
and
there
i
sat
in
it
almost
until
dawn
and
all
the
time
away
up
the
corridor
the
door
of
the
grey
room
thudded
at
solemn
and
horrid
intervals
it
was
a
miserable
brutal
night
when
the
day
began
to
break
the
thudding
of
the
door
came
gradually
to
an
end
and
at
last
i
got
hold
of
my
courage
and
went
along
the
corridor
in
the
half
light
to
cap
the
lens
of
my
camera
i
can
tell
you
it
took
some
doing
but
if
i
had
not
done
so
my
photograph
would
have
been
spoilt
and
i
was
tremendously
keen
to
save
it
i
got
back
to
my
room
and
then
and
rubbed
out
the
star
in
which
i
had
been
sitting
half
an
hour
later
there
was
a
tap
at
my
door
it
was
peter
with
my
coffee
when
i
had
drunk
it
we
both
went
along
to
the
grey
room
as
we
went
i
had
a
look
at
the
seals
on
the
other
doors
but
they
were
untouched
the
seal
on
the
door
of
the
grey
room
was
broken
as
also
was
the
string
from
the
trigger
of
the
flashlight
but
the
card
over
the
keyhole
was
still
there
i
ripped
it
off
and
opened
the
door
nothing
unusual
was
to
be
seen
until
we
came
to
the
bed
then
i
saw
that
as
on
the
previous
day
the
bedclothes
had
been
torn
off
and
hurled
into
the
corner
exactly
where
i
had
seen
them
before
i
felt
very
queer
but
i
did
not
forget
to
look
at
all
the
seals
only
to
find
that
not
one
had
been
broken
then
i
turned
and
looked
at
old
peter
and
he
looked
at
me
nodding
his
head
get
out
of
here
i
said
no
place
for
any
living
human
to
enter
without
proper
protection
we
went
out
then
and
i
locked
and
sealed
the
door
again
after
breakfast
i
developed
the
negative
but
it
showed
only
the
door
of
the
grey
room
half
opened
then
i
left
the
house
as
i
wanted
to
get
certain
matters
and
implements
that
might
be
necessary
to
life
perhaps
to
the
spirit
for
i
intended
to
spend
the
coming
night
in
the
grey
room
i
got
back
in
a
cab
about
five
with
my
apparatus
and
this
peter
and
i
carried
up
to
the
grey
room
where
i
piled
it
carefully
in
the
center
of
the
floor
when
everything
was
in
the
room
including
a
cat
which
i
had
brought
i
locked
and
sealed
the
door
and
went
toward
the
bedroom
telling
peter
i
should
not
be
down
for
dinner
he
said
sir
and
went
downstairs
thinking
that
i
was
going
to
turn
in
which
was
what
i
wanted
him
to
believe
as
i
knew
he
would
have
worried
both
me
and
himself
if
he
had
known
what
i
intended
but
i
merely
got
my
camera
and
flashlight
from
my
bedroom
and
hurried
back
to
the
grey
room
i
locked
and
sealed
myself
in
and
set
to
work
for
i
had
a
lot
to
do
before
it
got
dark
first
i
cleared
away
all
the
ribbons
across
the
floor
then
i
carried
the
cat
still
fastened
in
its
basket
over
toward
the
far
wall
and
left
it
i
returned
then
to
the
center
of
the
room
and
measured
out
a
space
feet
in
diameter
which
i
swept
with
a
of
hyssop
about
this
i
drew
a
circle
of
chalk
taking
care
never
to
step
over
the
circle
beyond
this
i
smudged
with
a
bunch
of
garlic
a
broad
belt
right
around
the
chalked
circle
and
when
this
was
complete
i
took
from
among
my
stores
in
the
center
a
small
jar
of
a
certain
water
i
broke
away
the
parchment
and
withdrew
the
stopper
then
dipping
my
left
forefinger
in
the
little
jar
i
went
the
circle
again
making
upon
the
floor
just
within
the
line
of
chalk
the
second
sign
of
the
saaamaaa
ritual
and
joining
each
sign
most
carefully
with
the
crescent
i
can
tell
you
i
felt
easier
when
this
was
done
and
the
complete
then
i
unpacked
some
more
of
the
stuff
that
i
had
brought
and
placed
a
lighted
candle
in
the
of
each
crescent
after
that
i
drew
a
pentacle
so
that
each
of
the
five
points
of
the
defensive
star
touched
the
chalk
circle
in
the
five
points
of
the
star
i
placed
five
portions
of
the
bread
each
wrapped
in
linen
and
in
the
five
five
opened
jars
of
the
water
i
had
used
to
make
the
circle
and
now
i
had
my
first
protective
barrier
complete
now
anyone
except
you
who
know
something
of
my
methods
of
investigation
might
consider
all
this
a
piece
of
useless
and
foolish
superstition
but
you
all
remember
the
black
veil
case
in
which
i
believe
my
life
was
saved
by
a
very
similar
form
of
protection
whilst
aster
who
sneered
at
it
and
would
not
come
inside
died
i
got
the
idea
from
the
sigsand
written
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
in
the
century
at
first
naturally
i
imagined
it
was
just
an
expression
of
the
superstition
of
his
time
and
it
was
not
until
a
year
later
that
it
occurred
to
me
to
test
his
which
i
did
as
i
just
said
in
that
horrible
black
veil
business
you
know
how
turned
out
later
i
used
it
several
times
and
always
i
came
through
safe
until
that
moving
fur
case
it
was
only
a
partial
therefore
and
i
nearly
died
in
the
pentacle
after
that
i
came
across
professor
with
a
medium
when
they
surrounded
the
medium
with
a
current
in
vacuum
he
lost
his
power
almost
as
if
it
cut
him
off
from
the
immaterial
that
made
me
think
a
lot
and
that
is
how
i
came
to
make
the
electric
pentacle
which
is
a
most
marvelous
against
certain
manifestations
i
used
the
shape
of
the
defensive
star
for
this
protection
because
i
have
personally
no
doubt
at
all
but
that
there
is
some
extraordinary
virtue
in
the
old
magic
figure
curious
thing
for
a
twentieth
century
man
to
admit
is
it
not
but
then
as
you
all
know
i
never
did
and
never
will
allow
myself
to
be
blinded
by
the
little
cheap
laughter
i
ask
questions
and
keep
my
eyes
open
in
this
last
case
i
had
little
doubt
that
i
had
run
up
against
a
supernatural
monster
and
i
meant
to
take
every
possible
care
for
the
danger
is
abominable
i
now
to
fit
the
electric
pentacle
setting
it
so
that
each
of
its
and
coincided
exactly
with
the
and
of
the
drawn
pentagram
upon
the
floor
then
i
connected
up
the
battery
and
the
next
instant
the
pale
blue
glare
from
the
intertwining
vacuum
tubes
shone
out
i
glanced
about
me
then
with
something
of
a
sigh
of
relief
and
realized
suddenly
that
the
dusk
was
upon
me
for
the
window
was
grey
and
unfriendly
then
at
the
big
empty
room
over
the
double
barrier
of
electric
and
candle
light
i
had
an
abrupt
extraordinary
sense
of
weirdness
thrust
upon
me
in
the
air
you
know
as
it
were
a
sense
of
something
inhuman
impending
the
room
was
full
of
the
stench
of
bruised
garlic
a
smell
i
hate
i
turned
now
to
the
camera
and
saw
that
it
and
the
flashlight
were
in
order
then
i
tested
my
revolver
carefully
though
i
had
little
thought
that
it
would
be
needed
yet
to
what
extent
materialization
of
an
creature
is
possible
given
favorable
conditions
no
one
can
say
and
i
had
no
idea
what
horrible
thing
i
was
going
to
see
or
feel
the
presence
of
i
might
in
the
end
have
to
fight
with
a
materialized
monster
i
did
not
know
and
could
only
be
prepared
you
see
i
never
forgot
that
three
other
people
had
been
strangled
in
the
bed
close
to
me
and
the
fierce
slamming
of
the
door
i
had
heard
myself
i
had
no
doubt
that
i
was
investigating
a
dangerous
and
ugly
case
by
this
time
the
night
had
come
though
the
room
was
very
light
with
the
burning
candles
and
i
found
myself
glancing
behind
me
constantly
and
then
all
the
room
it
was
nervy
work
waiting
for
that
thing
to
come
then
suddenly
i
was
aware
of
a
little
cold
wind
sweeping
over
me
coming
from
behind
i
gave
one
great
and
a
prickly
feeling
went
all
over
the
back
of
my
head
then
i
hove
myself
with
a
sort
of
stiff
jerk
and
stared
straight
against
that
queer
wind
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
corner
of
the
room
to
the
left
of
the
bed
the
place
where
both
times
i
had
found
the
heap
of
tossed
bedclothes
yet
i
could
see
nothing
unusual
no
opening
nothing
abruptly
i
was
aware
that
the
candles
were
all
in
that
unnatural
wind
i
believe
i
just
squatted
there
and
stared
in
a
horribly
frightened
wooden
way
for
some
minutes
i
shall
never
be
able
to
let
you
know
how
disgustingly
horrible
it
was
sitting
in
that
vile
cold
wind
and
then
flick
flick
flick
all
the
candles
the
outer
barrier
went
out
and
there
was
i
locked
and
sealed
in
that
room
and
with
no
light
beyond
the
weakish
blue
glare
of
the
electric
pentacle
a
time
of
abominable
tenseness
passed
and
still
that
wind
blew
upon
me
and
then
suddenly
i
knew
that
something
stirred
in
the
corner
to
the
left
of
the
bed
i
was
made
conscious
of
it
rather
by
some
inward
unused
sense
than
by
either
sight
or
sound
for
the
pale
glare
of
the
pentacle
gave
but
a
very
poor
light
for
seeing
by
yet
as
i
stared
something
began
slowly
to
grow
upon
my
sight
a
moving
shadow
a
little
darker
than
the
surrounding
shadows
i
lost
the
thing
amid
the
vagueness
and
for
a
moment
or
two
i
glanced
swiftly
from
side
to
side
with
a
fresh
new
sense
of
impending
danger
then
my
attention
was
directed
to
the
bed
all
the
covering
were
being
drawn
steadily
off
with
a
hateful
stealthy
sort
of
motion
i
heard
the
slow
dragging
slither
of
the
clothes
but
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
thing
that
pulled
i
was
aware
in
a
funny
subconscious
introspective
fashion
that
the
had
come
upon
me
yet
that
i
was
cooler
mentally
than
i
had
been
for
some
minutes
sufficiently
so
to
feel
that
my
hands
were
sweating
coldly
and
to
shift
my
revolver
whilst
i
rubbed
my
right
hand
dry
upon
my
knee
though
never
for
an
instant
taking
my
gaze
or
my
attention
from
those
moving
clothes
the
faint
noises
from
the
bed
ceased
once
and
there
was
a
most
intense
silence
with
only
the
sound
of
the
blood
beating
in
my
head
yet
immediately
afterward
i
heard
again
the
slurring
of
the
bedclothes
being
dragged
off
the
bed
in
the
midst
of
my
nervous
tension
i
remembered
the
camera
and
reached
for
it
but
without
looking
away
from
the
bed
and
then
you
know
all
in
a
moment
the
whole
of
the
bed
coverings
were
torn
off
with
extraordinary
violence
and
i
heard
the
flump
they
made
as
they
were
hurled
into
the
corner
there
was
a
time
of
absolute
quietness
then
for
perhaps
a
couple
of
minutes
and
you
can
imagine
how
horrible
i
felt
the
bedclothes
had
been
thrown
with
such
savageness
and
then
again
the
brutal
unnaturalness
of
the
thing
that
had
just
been
done
before
me
abruptly
over
by
the
door
i
heard
a
faint
noise
a
sort
of
crickling
sound
and
then
a
pitter
or
two
upon
the
floor
a
great
nervous
thrill
swept
over
me
seeming
to
run
up
my
spine
and
over
the
back
of
my
head
for
the
seal
that
secured
the
door
had
just
been
broken
something
was
there
i
could
not
see
the
door
at
least
i
mean
to
say
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
how
much
i
actually
saw
and
how
much
my
imagination
supplied
i
made
it
out
only
as
a
continuation
of
the
grey
walls
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
dark
and
indistinct
moved
and
wavered
there
among
the
shadows
abruptly
i
was
aware
that
the
door
was
opening
and
with
an
effort
i
reached
again
for
my
camera
but
before
i
could
aim
it
the
door
was
slammed
with
a
terrific
crash
that
filled
the
whole
room
with
a
sort
of
hollow
thunder
i
jumped
like
a
frightened
child
there
seemed
such
a
power
behind
the
noise
as
though
a
vast
wanton
force
were
can
you
understand
the
door
was
not
touched
again
but
directly
afterward
i
heard
the
basket
in
which
the
cat
lay
creak
i
tell
you
i
fairly
pringled
all
along
my
back
i
knew
that
i
was
going
to
learn
definitely
whether
whatever
was
abroad
was
dangerous
to
life
from
the
cat
there
rose
suddenly
a
hideous
caterwaul
that
ceased
abruptly
and
then
too
late
i
snapped
off
the
flashlight
in
the
great
glare
i
saw
that
the
basket
had
been
overturned
and
the
lid
was
wrenched
open
with
the
cat
lying
half
in
and
half
out
upon
the
floor
i
saw
nothing
else
but
i
was
full
of
the
knowledge
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
some
being
or
thing
that
had
power
to
destroy
during
the
next
two
or
three
minutes
there
was
an
odd
noticeable
quietness
in
the
room
and
you
much
remember
i
was
for
the
time
because
of
the
flashlight
so
that
the
whole
place
seemed
to
be
pitchy
dark
just
beyond
the
shine
of
the
pentacle
i
tell
you
it
was
most
horrible
i
just
knelt
there
in
the
star
and
whirled
trying
to
see
whether
anything
was
coming
at
me
my
power
of
sight
came
gradually
and
i
got
a
little
hold
of
myself
and
abruptly
i
saw
the
thing
i
was
looking
for
close
to
the
circle
it
was
big
and
indistinct
and
wavered
curiously
as
though
the
shadow
of
a
vast
spider
hung
suspended
in
the
air
just
beyond
the
barrier
it
passed
swiftly
the
circle
and
seemed
to
probe
ever
toward
me
but
only
to
draw
back
with
extraordinary
jerky
movements
as
might
a
living
person
if
they
touched
the
hot
bar
of
a
grate
and
it
moved
and
and
i
turned
then
just
opposite
to
one
of
the
vales
in
the
pentacles
it
seemed
to
pause
as
though
preliminary
to
a
tremendous
effort
it
retired
almost
beyond
the
glow
of
the
vacuum
light
and
then
came
straight
toward
me
appearing
to
gather
form
and
solidity
as
it
came
there
seemed
a
vast
malign
determination
behind
the
movement
that
must
succeed
i
was
on
my
knees
and
i
jerked
back
falling
on
to
my
left
hand
and
hip
in
a
wild
endeavor
to
get
back
from
the
advancing
thing
with
my
right
hand
i
was
grabbing
madly
for
my
revolver
which
i
had
let
slip
the
brutal
thing
came
with
one
great
sweep
straight
over
the
garlic
and
the
circle
almost
to
the
vale
of
the
pentacle
i
believe
i
yelled
then
just
as
suddenly
as
it
had
swept
over
it
seemed
to
be
hurled
back
by
some
mighty
invisible
force
it
must
have
been
some
moments
before
i
realized
that
i
was
safe
and
then
i
got
myself
together
in
the
middle
of
the
pentacles
feeling
horribly
gone
and
shaken
and
glancing
and
the
barrier
but
the
thing
had
vanished
yet
i
had
learnt
something
for
i
knew
now
that
the
grey
room
was
haunted
by
a
monstrous
hand
suddenly
as
i
crouched
there
i
saw
what
had
so
nearly
given
the
monster
an
opening
through
the
barrier
in
my
movements
within
the
pentacle
i
must
have
touched
one
of
the
jars
of
water
for
just
where
the
thing
had
made
its
attack
the
jar
that
guarded
the
of
the
had
been
moved
to
one
side
and
this
had
left
one
of
the
unguarded
i
put
it
back
quickly
and
felt
almost
safe
again
for
i
had
found
the
cause
and
the
was
still
good
and
i
began
to
hope
again
that
i
should
see
the
morning
come
in
when
i
saw
that
thing
so
nearly
succeed
i
had
an
awful
weak
overwhelming
feeling
that
the
could
never
bring
me
safe
through
the
night
against
such
a
force
you
can
understand
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
see
the
hand
but
presently
i
thought
i
saw
once
or
twice
an
odd
wavering
over
among
the
shadows
near
the
door
a
little
later
as
though
in
a
sudden
fit
of
malignant
rage
the
dead
body
of
the
cat
was
picked
up
and
beaten
with
dull
sickening
blows
against
the
solid
floor
that
made
me
feel
rather
queer
a
minute
afterward
the
door
was
opened
and
slammed
twice
with
tremendous
force
the
next
instant
the
thing
made
one
swift
vicious
dart
at
me
from
out
of
the
shadows
instinctively
i
started
sideways
from
it
and
so
plucked
my
hand
from
upon
the
electric
pentacle
where
for
a
wickedly
careless
moment
i
had
placed
it
the
monster
was
hurled
off
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
pentacles
though
owing
to
my
inconceivable
foolishness
it
had
been
enabled
for
a
second
time
to
pass
the
outer
barriers
i
can
tell
you
i
shook
for
a
time
with
sheer
funk
i
moved
right
to
the
center
of
the
pentacles
again
and
knelt
there
making
myself
as
small
and
compact
as
possible
as
i
knelt
there
came
to
me
presently
a
vague
wonder
at
the
two
which
had
so
nearly
allowed
the
brute
to
get
at
me
was
i
being
to
unconscious
voluntary
actions
that
endangered
me
the
thought
took
hold
of
me
and
i
watched
my
every
movement
abruptly
i
stretched
a
tired
leg
and
knocked
over
one
of
the
jars
of
water
some
was
spilled
but
because
of
my
suspicious
watchfulness
i
had
it
upright
and
back
within
the
vale
while
yet
some
of
the
water
remained
even
as
i
did
so
the
vast
black
hand
beat
up
at
me
out
of
the
shadows
and
seemed
to
leap
almost
into
my
face
so
nearly
did
it
approach
but
for
the
third
time
it
was
thrown
back
by
some
altogether
enormous
overmastering
force
yet
apart
from
the
dazed
fright
in
which
it
left
me
i
had
for
a
moment
that
feeling
of
spiritual
sickness
as
if
some
delicate
beautiful
inward
grace
had
suffered
which
is
felt
only
upon
the
too
near
approach
of
the
and
is
more
dreadful
in
a
strange
way
than
any
physical
pain
that
can
be
suffered
i
knew
by
this
more
of
the
extent
and
closeness
of
the
danger
and
for
a
long
time
i
was
simply
cowed
by
the
brutality
of
that
force
upon
my
spirit
i
can
put
it
no
other
way
i
knelt
again
in
the
center
of
the
pentacles
watching
myself
with
more
fear
almost
than
the
monster
for
i
knew
now
that
unless
i
guarded
myself
from
every
sudden
impulse
that
came
to
me
i
might
simply
work
my
own
destruction
do
you
see
how
horrible
it
all
was
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
a
haze
of
sick
fright
and
so
tense
that
i
could
not
make
a
single
movement
naturally
i
was
in
such
fear
that
any
desire
for
action
that
came
to
me
might
be
prompted
by
the
influence
that
i
knew
was
at
work
on
me
and
outside
of
the
barrier
that
ghastly
thing
went
and
grabbing
and
grabbing
in
the
air
at
me
twice
more
was
the
body
of
the
dead
cat
molested
the
second
time
i
heard
every
bone
in
its
body
scrunch
and
crack
and
all
the
time
the
horrible
wind
was
blowing
upon
me
from
the
corner
of
the
room
to
the
left
of
the
bed
then
just
as
the
first
touch
of
dawn
came
into
the
sky
that
unnatural
wind
ceased
in
a
single
moment
and
i
could
see
no
sign
of
the
hand
the
dawn
came
slowly
and
presently
the
wan
light
filled
all
the
room
and
made
the
pale
glare
of
the
electric
pentacle
look
more
unearthly
yet
it
was
not
until
the
day
had
fully
come
that
i
made
any
attempt
to
leave
the
barrier
for
i
did
not
know
but
that
there
was
some
method
abroad
in
the
sudden
stopping
of
that
wind
to
entice
me
from
the
pentacles
at
last
when
the
dawn
was
strong
and
bright
i
took
one
last
look
and
ran
for
the
door
i
got
it
unlocked
in
a
nervous
and
clumsy
fashion
then
locked
it
hurriedly
and
went
to
my
bedroom
where
i
lay
on
the
bed
and
tried
to
steady
my
nerves
peter
came
presently
with
the
coffee
and
when
i
had
drunk
it
i
told
him
i
meant
to
have
a
sleep
as
i
had
been
up
all
night
he
took
the
tray
and
went
out
quietly
and
after
i
had
locked
my
door
i
turned
in
properly
and
at
last
got
to
sleep
i
woke
about
midday
and
after
some
lunch
went
up
to
the
grey
room
i
switched
off
the
current
from
the
pentacle
which
i
had
left
on
in
my
hurry
also
i
removed
the
body
of
the
cat
you
can
understand
i
did
not
want
anyone
to
see
the
poor
brute
after
that
i
made
a
very
careful
search
of
the
corner
where
the
bedclothes
had
been
thrown
i
made
several
holes
and
probed
and
found
nothing
then
it
occurred
to
me
to
try
with
my
instrument
under
the
skirting
i
did
so
and
heard
my
wire
ring
on
metal
i
turned
the
hook
end
that
way
and
fished
for
the
thing
at
the
second
go
i
got
it
it
was
a
small
object
and
i
took
it
to
the
window
i
found
it
to
be
a
curious
ring
made
of
some
greying
material
the
curious
thing
about
it
was
that
it
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
pentagon
that
is
the
same
shape
as
the
inside
of
the
magic
pentacle
but
without
the
which
form
the
points
of
the
defensive
star
it
was
free
from
all
chasing
or
engraving
you
will
understand
that
i
was
excited
when
i
tell
you
that
i
felt
sure
i
held
in
my
hand
the
famous
luck
ring
of
the
anderson
family
which
indeed
was
of
all
things
the
one
most
intimately
connected
with
the
history
of
the
haunting
this
ring
was
handed
on
from
father
to
son
through
generations
and
always
in
obedience
to
some
ancient
family
tradition
each
son
had
to
promise
never
to
wear
the
ring
the
ring
i
may
say
was
brought
home
by
one
of
the
crusaders
under
very
peculiar
circumstances
but
the
story
is
too
long
to
go
into
here
it
appears
that
young
sir
hulbert
an
ancestor
of
anderson
made
a
bet
in
drink
you
know
that
he
would
wear
the
ring
that
night
he
did
so
and
in
the
morning
his
wife
and
child
were
found
strangled
in
the
bed
in
the
very
room
in
which
i
stood
many
people
it
would
seem
thought
young
sir
hulbert
was
guilty
of
having
done
the
thing
in
drunken
anger
and
he
in
an
attempt
to
prove
his
innocence
slept
a
second
night
in
the
room
he
also
was
strangled
since
then
as
you
may
imagine
no
one
has
ever
spent
a
night
in
the
grey
room
until
i
did
so
the
ring
had
been
lost
so
long
that
it
had
become
almost
a
myth
and
it
was
most
extraordinary
to
stand
there
with
the
actual
thing
in
my
hand
as
you
can
understand
it
was
whilst
i
stood
there
looking
at
the
ring
that
i
got
an
idea
supposing
that
it
were
in
a
way
a
doorway
you
see
what
i
mean
a
sort
of
gap
in
the
it
was
a
queer
idea
i
know
and
probably
was
not
my
own
but
came
to
me
from
the
outside
you
see
the
wind
had
come
from
that
part
of
the
room
where
the
ring
lay
i
thought
a
lot
about
it
then
the
shape
the
inside
of
a
pentacle
it
had
no
and
without
mounts
as
the
sigsand
has
it
mownts
wych
are
thee
five
hills
of
safetie
to
lack
is
to
gyve
to
thee
daemon
and
surelie
to
fayvor
the
evill
thynge
you
see
the
very
shape
of
the
ring
was
significant
and
i
determined
to
test
it
i
unmade
the
pentacle
for
it
must
be
made
afresh
the
one
to
be
protected
then
i
went
out
and
locked
the
door
after
which
i
left
the
house
to
get
certain
matters
for
neither
nor
fyre
nor
must
be
used
a
second
time
i
returned
about
seven
thirty
and
as
soon
as
the
things
i
had
brought
had
been
carried
up
to
the
grey
room
i
dismissed
peter
for
the
night
just
as
i
had
done
the
evening
before
when
he
had
gone
downstairs
i
let
myself
into
the
room
and
locked
and
sealed
the
door
i
went
to
the
place
in
the
center
of
the
room
where
all
the
stuff
had
been
packed
and
set
to
work
with
all
my
speed
to
construct
a
barrier
about
me
and
the
ring
i
do
not
remember
whether
i
explained
it
to
you
but
i
had
reasoned
that
if
the
ring
were
in
any
way
a
of
admission
and
it
were
enclosed
with
me
in
the
electric
pentacle
it
would
be
to
express
it
loosely
insulated
do
you
see
the
force
which
had
visible
expression
as
a
hand
would
have
to
stay
beyond
the
barrier
which
separates
the
ab
from
the
normal
for
the
would
be
removed
from
accessibility
as
i
was
saying
i
worked
with
all
my
speed
to
get
the
barrier
completed
about
me
and
the
ring
for
it
was
already
later
than
i
cared
to
be
in
that
room
also
i
had
a
feeling
that
there
would
be
a
vast
effort
made
that
night
to
regain
the
use
of
the
ring
for
i
had
the
strongest
conviction
that
the
ring
was
a
necessity
to
materialization
you
will
see
whether
i
was
right
i
completed
the
barriers
in
about
an
hour
and
you
can
imagine
something
of
the
relief
i
felt
when
i
felt
the
pale
glare
of
the
electric
pentacle
once
more
all
about
me
from
then
onward
for
about
two
hours
i
sat
quietly
facing
the
corner
from
which
the
wind
came
about
eleven
a
queer
knowledge
came
that
something
was
near
to
me
yet
nothing
happened
for
a
whole
hour
after
that
then
suddenly
i
felt
the
cold
queer
wind
begin
to
blow
upon
me
to
my
astonishment
it
seemed
now
to
come
from
behind
me
and
i
whipped
with
a
hideous
quake
of
fear
the
wind
met
me
in
the
face
it
was
blowing
up
from
the
floor
close
to
me
i
stared
down
in
a
sickening
maze
of
new
frights
what
on
earth
had
i
done
now
the
ring
was
there
close
beside
me
where
i
had
put
it
suddenly
as
i
stared
bewildered
i
was
aware
that
there
was
something
queer
about
the
ring
funny
shadowy
movements
and
convolutions
i
looked
at
them
stupidly
and
then
abruptly
i
knew
that
the
wind
was
blowing
up
at
me
from
the
ring
a
queer
indistinct
smoke
became
visible
to
me
seeming
to
pour
upward
through
the
ring
and
mix
with
the
moving
shadows
suddenly
i
realized
that
i
was
in
more
than
any
mortal
danger
for
the
convoluting
shadows
about
the
ring
were
taking
shape
and
the
was
forming
the
pentacle
my
goodness
do
you
realize
it
i
had
brought
the
into
the
pentacles
and
the
brute
was
coming
through
pouring
into
the
material
world
as
gas
might
pour
out
from
the
mouth
of
a
pipe
i
should
think
that
i
knelt
for
a
moment
in
a
sort
of
stunned
fright
then
with
a
mad
awkward
movement
i
snatched
at
the
ring
intending
to
hurl
it
out
of
the
pentacle
yet
it
eluded
me
as
though
some
invisible
living
thing
jerked
it
hither
and
thither
at
last
i
gripped
it
yet
in
the
same
instant
it
was
torn
from
my
grasp
with
incredible
and
brutal
force
a
great
black
shadow
covered
it
and
rose
into
the
air
and
came
at
me
i
saw
that
it
was
the
hand
vast
and
nearly
perfect
in
form
i
gave
one
crazy
yell
and
jumped
over
the
pentacle
and
the
ring
of
burning
candles
and
ran
despairingly
for
the
door
i
fumbled
idiotically
and
ineffectually
with
the
key
and
all
the
time
i
stared
with
a
fear
that
was
like
insanity
toward
the
barriers
the
hand
was
plunging
toward
me
yet
even
as
it
had
been
unable
to
pass
into
the
pentacle
when
the
ring
was
without
so
now
that
the
ring
was
within
it
had
no
power
to
pass
out
the
monster
was
chained
as
surely
as
any
beast
would
be
were
chains
riveted
upon
it
even
then
i
got
a
flash
of
this
knowledge
but
i
was
too
utterly
shaken
with
fright
to
reason
and
the
instant
i
managed
to
get
the
key
turned
i
sprang
into
the
passage
and
slammed
the
door
with
a
crash
i
locked
it
and
got
to
my
room
somehow
for
i
was
trembling
so
that
i
could
hardly
stand
as
you
can
imagine
i
locked
myself
in
and
managed
to
get
the
candle
lit
then
i
lay
down
on
my
bed
and
kept
quiet
for
an
hour
or
two
and
so
i
got
steadied
i
got
a
little
sleep
later
but
woke
when
peter
brought
my
coffee
when
i
had
drunk
it
i
felt
altogether
better
and
took
the
old
man
along
with
me
whilst
i
had
a
look
into
the
grey
room
i
opened
the
door
and
peeped
in
the
candles
were
still
burning
wan
against
the
daylight
and
behind
them
was
the
pale
glowing
star
of
the
electric
pentacle
and
there
in
the
middle
was
the
ring
the
gateway
of
the
monster
lying
demure
and
ordinary
nothing
in
the
room
was
touched
and
i
knew
that
the
brute
had
never
managed
to
cross
the
pentacles
then
i
went
out
and
locked
the
door
after
a
sleep
of
some
hours
i
left
the
house
i
returned
in
the
afternoon
in
a
cab
i
had
with
me
an
jet
and
two
cylinders
containing
the
gases
i
carried
the
things
into
the
grey
room
and
there
in
the
center
of
the
electric
pentacle
i
erected
the
little
furnace
five
minutes
later
the
luck
ring
once
the
but
now
the
of
the
anderson
family
was
no
more
than
a
little
solid
splash
of
hot
metal
carnacki
felt
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
something
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
he
passed
it
to
me
i
opened
it
and
found
a
small
circle
of
greyish
metal
something
like
lead
only
harder
and
rather
brighter
well
i
asked
at
length
after
examining
it
and
handing
it
to
the
others
did
that
stop
the
haunting
carnacki
nodded
yes
he
said
i
slept
three
nights
in
the
grey
room
before
i
left
old
peter
nearly
fainted
when
he
knew
that
i
meant
to
but
by
the
third
night
he
seemed
to
realize
that
the
house
was
just
safe
and
ordinary
and
you
know
i
believe
in
his
heart
he
hardly
approved
carnacki
stood
up
and
began
to
shake
hands
out
you
go
he
said
genially
and
presently
we
went
pondering
to
our
various
homes
no
the
house
among
the
laurels
this
is
a
curious
yarn
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
said
carnacki
as
after
a
quiet
little
dinner
we
made
ourselves
comfortable
in
his
cozy
dining
room
i
have
just
got
back
from
the
west
of
ireland
he
continued
wentworth
a
friend
of
mine
has
lately
had
rather
an
unexpected
legacy
in
the
shape
of
a
large
estate
and
manor
about
a
mile
and
a
half
outside
of
the
village
of
korunton
this
place
is
named
gannington
manor
and
has
been
empty
a
great
number
of
years
as
you
will
find
is
almost
always
the
case
with
houses
reputed
to
be
haunted
as
it
is
usually
termed
it
seems
that
when
wentworth
went
over
to
take
possession
he
found
the
place
in
very
poor
repair
and
the
estate
totally
uncared
for
and
as
i
know
looking
very
desolate
and
lonesome
generally
he
went
through
the
big
house
by
himself
and
he
admitted
to
me
that
it
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
about
it
but
of
course
that
might
be
nothing
more
than
the
natural
dismalness
of
a
big
empty
house
which
has
been
long
uninhabited
and
through
which
you
are
wandering
alone
when
he
had
finished
his
look
he
went
down
to
the
village
meaning
to
see
the
agent
of
the
estate
and
arrange
for
someone
to
go
in
as
caretaker
the
agent
who
proved
by
the
way
to
be
a
scotchman
was
very
willing
to
take
up
the
management
of
the
estate
once
more
but
he
assured
wentworth
that
they
would
get
no
one
to
go
in
as
caretaker
and
that
his
the
agent
advice
was
to
have
the
house
pulled
down
and
a
new
one
built
this
naturally
astonished
my
friend
and
as
they
went
down
to
the
village
he
managed
to
get
a
sort
of
explanation
from
the
man
it
seems
that
there
had
been
always
curious
stories
told
about
the
place
which
in
the
early
days
was
called
landru
castle
and
that
within
the
last
seven
years
there
had
been
two
extraordinary
deaths
there
in
each
case
they
had
been
tramps
who
were
ignorant
of
the
reputation
of
the
house
and
had
probably
thought
the
big
empty
place
suitable
for
a
night
free
lodging
there
had
been
absolutely
no
signs
of
violence
to
indicate
the
method
by
which
death
was
caused
and
on
each
occasion
the
body
had
been
found
in
the
great
entrance
hall
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
inn
where
wentworth
had
put
up
and
he
told
the
agent
that
he
would
prove
that
it
was
all
rubbish
about
the
haunting
by
staying
a
night
or
two
in
the
manor
himself
the
death
of
the
tramps
was
certainly
curious
but
did
not
prove
that
any
supernatural
agency
had
been
at
work
they
were
but
isolated
accidents
spread
over
a
large
number
of
years
by
the
memory
of
the
villagers
which
was
natural
enough
in
a
little
place
like
korunton
tramps
had
to
die
some
time
and
in
some
place
and
it
proved
nothing
that
two
out
of
possibly
hundreds
who
had
slept
in
the
empty
house
had
happened
to
take
the
opportunity
to
die
under
shelter
but
the
agent
took
his
remark
very
seriously
and
both
he
and
dennis
the
landlord
of
the
inn
tried
their
best
to
persuade
him
not
to
go
for
his
sake
irish
dennis
begged
him
to
do
no
such
thing
and
because
of
his
sake
the
scotchman
was
equally
in
earnest
it
was
late
afternoon
at
the
time
and
as
wentworth
told
me
it
was
warm
and
bright
and
it
seemed
such
utter
rot
to
hear
those
two
talking
seriously
about
the
impossible
he
felt
full
of
pluck
and
he
made
up
his
mind
he
would
smash
the
story
of
the
haunting
at
once
by
staying
that
very
night
in
the
manor
he
made
this
quite
clear
to
them
and
told
them
that
it
would
be
more
to
the
point
and
to
their
credit
if
they
offered
to
come
up
along
with
him
and
keep
him
company
but
poor
old
dennis
was
quite
shocked
i
believe
at
the
suggestion
and
though
tabbit
the
agent
took
it
more
quietly
he
was
very
solemn
about
it
it
seems
that
wentworth
did
go
and
though
as
he
said
to
me
when
the
evening
began
to
come
on
it
seemed
a
very
different
sort
of
thing
to
tackle
a
whole
crowd
of
the
villagers
assembled
to
see
him
off
for
by
this
time
they
all
knew
of
his
intention
wentworth
had
his
gun
with
him
and
a
big
packet
of
candles
and
he
made
it
clear
to
them
all
that
it
would
not
be
wise
for
anyone
to
play
any
tricks
as
he
intended
to
shoot
sight
and
then
you
know
he
got
a
hint
of
how
serious
they
considered
the
whole
thing
for
one
of
them
came
up
to
him
leading
a
great
bullmastiff
and
offered
it
to
him
to
take
to
keep
him
company
wentworth
patted
his
gun
but
the
old
man
who
owned
the
dog
shook
his
head
and
explained
that
the
brute
might
warn
him
in
sufficient
time
for
him
to
get
away
from
the
castle
for
it
was
obvious
that
he
did
not
consider
the
gun
would
prove
of
any
use
wentworth
took
the
dog
and
thanked
the
man
he
told
me
that
already
he
was
beginning
to
wish
that
he
had
not
said
definitely
that
he
would
go
but
as
it
was
he
was
simply
forced
to
he
went
through
the
crowd
of
men
and
found
suddenly
that
they
had
all
turned
in
a
body
and
were
keeping
him
company
they
stayed
with
him
all
the
way
to
the
manor
and
then
went
right
over
the
whole
place
with
him
it
was
still
daylight
when
this
was
finished
though
turning
to
dusk
and
for
a
while
the
men
stood
about
hesitating
as
if
they
felt
ashamed
to
go
away
and
leave
wentworth
there
all
alone
he
told
me
that
by
this
time
he
would
gladly
have
given
fifty
pounds
to
be
going
back
with
them
and
then
abruptly
an
idea
came
to
him
he
suggested
that
they
should
stay
with
him
and
keep
him
company
through
the
night
for
a
time
they
refused
and
tried
to
persuade
him
to
go
back
with
them
but
finally
he
made
a
proposition
that
got
home
to
them
all
he
planned
that
they
should
all
go
back
to
the
inn
and
there
get
a
couple
of
dozen
bottles
of
whisky
a
of
turf
and
wood
and
some
more
candles
then
they
would
come
back
and
make
a
great
fire
in
the
big
light
all
the
candles
and
put
them
the
place
open
the
whisky
and
make
a
night
of
it
and
by
jove
he
got
them
to
agree
they
set
off
back
and
were
soon
at
the
inn
and
here
whilst
the
donkey
was
being
loaded
and
the
candles
and
whisky
distributed
dennis
was
doing
his
best
to
keep
wentworth
from
going
back
but
he
was
a
sensible
man
in
his
way
for
when
he
found
that
it
was
no
use
he
stopped
you
see
he
did
not
want
to
frighten
the
others
from
accompanying
wentworth
tell
ye
sorr
he
told
him
of
no
use

all
thryin

though
all
the
gold

was

asked
him
what
he

said

an
fire
an
thin
in
the
darkness
the
virgin
herself
would
be
powerless
to
protect
ye
wentworth
told
me
he
laughed
at
this
chiefly
because
as
he
put
it
always
must
laugh
at
that
sort
of
yarn
however
it
makes
you
feel
inside
he
asked
old
dennis
whether
he
expected
him
to
believe
it
sorr
said
dennis
do
mane
ye
to
it
an
please
god
if
ye
ye
may
be
back
safe
befor
mornin
the
man
serious
simplicity
took
hold
of
wentworth
and
he
held
out
his
hand
but
for
all
that
he
went
and
i
must
admire
his
pluck
there
were
now
about
forty
men
and
when
they
got
back
to
the
manor
or
castle
as
the
villagers
always
call
it
they
were
not
long
in
getting
a
big
fire
going
and
lighted
candles
all
the
great
hall
they
had
all
brought
sticks
so
that
they
would
have
been
a
pretty
formidable
lot
to
tackle
by
anything
simply
physical
and
of
course
wentworth
had
his
gun
he
kept
the
whisky
in
his
own
charge
for
he
intended
to
keep
them
sober
but
he
gave
them
a
good
strong
tot
all
first
so
as
to
make
things
seem
cheerful
and
to
get
them
yearning
if
you
once
let
a
crowd
of
men
like
that
grow
silent
they
begin
to
think
and
then
to
fancy
things
the
big
entrance
door
had
been
left
wide
open
by
his
orders
which
shows
that
he
had
taken
some
notice
of
dennis
it
was
a
quiet
night
so
this
did
not
matter
for
the
lights
kept
steady
and
all
went
on
in
a
jolly
sort
of
fashion
for
about
three
hours
he
had
opened
a
second
lot
of
bottles
and
everyone
was
feeling
cheerful
so
much
so
that
one
of
the
men
called
out
aloud
to
the
ghosts
to
come
out
and
show
themselves
and
then
you
know
a
very
extraordinary
thing
happened
for
the
ponderous
main
door
swung
quietly
and
steadily
to
as
though
pushed
by
an
invisible
hand
and
shut
with
a
sharp
click
wentworth
stared
feeling
suddenly
rather
chilly
then
he
remembered
the
men
and
looked
at
them
several
had
ceased
their
talk
and
were
staring
in
a
frightened
way
at
the
big
door
but
the
great
number
had
never
noticed
and
were
talking
and
yarning
he
reached
for
his
gun
and
the
following
instant
the
great
bullmastiff
set
up
a
tremendous
barking
which
drew
the
attention
of
the
whole
company
the
hall
i
should
tell
you
is
oblong
the
south
wall
is
all
windows
but
the
north
and
east
have
rows
of
doors
leading
into
the
house
whilst
the
west
wall
is
occupied
by
the
great
entrance
the
rows
of
doors
leading
into
the
house
were
all
closed
and
it
was
toward
one
of
these
in
the
north
wall
that
the
big
dog
ran
yet
he
would
not
go
very
close
and
suddenly
the
door
began
to
move
slowly
open
until
the
blackness
of
the
passage
beyond
was
shown
the
dog
came
back
among
the
men
whimpering
and
for
a
minute
there
was
an
absolute
silence
then
wentworth
went
out
from
the
men
a
little
and
aimed
his
gun
at
the
doorway
is
there
come
out
or
i
shall
fire
he
shouted
but
nothing
came
and
he
blazed
forth
both
barrels
into
the
dark
as
though
the
report
had
been
a
signal
all
the
doors
along
the
north
and
east
walls
moved
slowly
open
and
wentworth
and
his
men
were
staring
frightened
into
the
black
shapes
of
the
empty
doorways
wentworth
loaded
his
gun
quickly
and
called
to
the
dog
but
the
brute
was
burrowing
away
in
among
the
men
and
this
fear
on
the
dog
part
frightened
wentworth
more
he
told
me
than
anything
then
something
else
happened
three
of
the
candles
over
in
the
corner
of
the
hall
went
out
and
immediately
about
half
a
dozen
in
different
parts
of
the
place
more
candles
were
put
out
and
the
hall
had
become
quite
dark
in
the
corners
the
men
were
all
standing
now
holding
their
clubs
and
crowded
together
and
no
one
said
a
word
wentworth
told
me
he
felt
positively
ill
with
fright
i
know
the
feeling
then
suddenly
something
splashed
on
to
the
back
of
his
left
hand
he
lifted
it
and
looked
it
was
covered
with
a
great
splash
of
red
that
dripped
from
his
fingers
an
old
irishman
near
to
him
saw
it
and
croaked
out
in
a
quavering
voice
when
the
old
man
called
out
they
all
looked
and
in
the
same
instant
others
felt
it
upon
them
there
were
frightened
cries
of
the
and
then
about
a
dozen
candles
went
out
simultaneously
and
the
hall
was
suddenly
dark
the
dog
let
out
a
great
mournful
howl
and
there
was
a
horrible
little
silence
with
everyone
standing
rigid
then
the
tension
broke
and
there
was
a
mad
rush
for
the
main
door
they
wrenched
it
open
and
tumbled
out
into
the
dark
but
something
slammed
it
with
a
crash
after
them
and
shut
the
dog
in
for
wentworth
heard
it
howling
as
they
raced
down
the
drive
yet
no
one
had
the
pluck
to
go
back
to
let
it
out
which
does
not
surprise
me
wentworth
sent
for
me
the
following
day
he
had
heard
of
me
in
connection
with
that
steeple
monster
case
i
arrived
by
the
night
mail
and
put
up
with
wentworth
at
the
inn
the
next
day
we
went
up
to
the
old
manor
which
certainly
lies
in
rather
a
wilderness
though
what
struck
me
most
was
the
extraordinary
number
of
laurel
bushes
about
the
house
the
place
was
smothered
with
them
so
that
the
house
seemed
to
be
growing
up
out
of
a
sea
of
green
laurel
these
and
the
grim
ancient
look
of
the
old
building
made
the
place
look
a
bit
dank
and
ghostly
even
by
daylight
the
hall
was
a
big
place
and
well
lit
by
daylight
for
which
i
was
not
sorry
you
see
i
had
been
rather
by
wentworth
yarn
we
found
one
rather
funny
thing
and
that
was
the
great
bullmastiff
lying
stiff
with
its
neck
broken
this
made
me
feel
very
serious
for
it
showed
that
whether
the
cause
was
supernatural
or
not
there
was
present
in
the
house
some
force
exceedingly
dangerous
to
life
later
whilst
wentworth
stood
guard
with
his
shotgun
i
made
an
examination
of
the
hall
the
bottles
and
mugs
from
which
the
men
had
drunk
their
whisky
were
scattered
about
and
all
over
the
place
were
the
candles
stuck
upright
in
their
own
grease
but
in
the
somewhat
brief
and
general
search
i
found
nothing
and
decided
to
begin
my
usual
exact
examination
of
every
square
foot
of
the
place
not
only
of
the
hall
in
this
case
but
of
the
whole
interior
of
the
castle
i
spent
three
uncomfortable
weeks
searching
but
without
result
of
any
kind
and
you
know
the
care
i
take
at
this
period
is
extreme
for
i
have
solved
hundreds
of
cases
of
at
this
early
stage
simply
by
the
most
minute
investigation
and
the
keeping
of
a
perfectly
open
mind
but
as
i
have
said
i
found
nothing
during
the
whole
of
the
examination
i
got
wentworth
to
stand
guard
with
his
loaded
shotgun
and
i
was
very
particular
that
we
were
never
caught
there
after
dusk
i
decided
now
to
make
the
experiment
of
staying
a
night
in
the
great
hall
of
course
i
spoke
about
it
to
wentworth
but
his
own
attempt
had
made
him
so
nervous
that
he
begged
me
to
do
no
such
thing
however
i
thought
it
well
worth
the
risk
and
i
managed
in
the
end
to
persuade
him
to
be
present
with
this
in
view
i
went
to
the
neighboring
town
of
gaunt
and
by
an
arrangement
with
the
chief
constable
i
obtained
the
services
of
six
policemen
with
their
rifles
the
arrangement
was
unofficial
of
course
and
the
men
were
allowed
to
volunteer
with
a
promise
of
payment
when
the
constables
arrived
early
that
evening
at
the
inn
i
gave
them
a
good
feed
and
after
that
we
all
set
out
for
the
manor
we
had
four
donkeys
with
us
loaded
with
fuel
and
other
matters
also
two
great
boarhounds
which
one
of
the
police
led
when
we
reached
the
house
i
set
the
men
to
unload
the
donkeys
whilst
wentworth
and
i
and
sealed
all
the
doors
except
the
main
entrance
with
tape
and
wax
for
if
the
doors
were
really
opened
i
was
going
to
be
sure
of
the
fact
i
was
going
to
run
no
risk
of
being
deceived
by
ghostly
hallucination
or
mesmeric
influence
by
the
time
that
this
was
done
the
policemen
had
unloaded
the
donkeys
and
were
waiting
looking
about
them
curiously
i
set
two
of
them
to
lay
a
fire
in
the
big
grate
and
the
others
i
used
as
i
required
them
i
took
one
of
the
boarhounds
to
the
end
of
the
hall
furthest
from
the
entrance
and
there
i
drove
a
staple
into
the
floor
to
which
i
tied
the
dog
with
a
short
tether
then
him
i
drew
upon
the
floor
the
figure
of
a
pentacle
in
chalk
outside
of
the
pentacle
i
made
a
circle
with
garlic
i
did
exactly
the
same
thing
with
the
other
hound
but
over
more
in
the
northeast
corner
of
the
big
hall
where
the
two
rows
of
doors
make
the
angle
when
this
was
done
i
cleared
the
whole
center
of
the
hall
and
put
one
of
the
policemen
to
sweep
it
after
which
i
had
all
my
apparatus
carried
into
the
cleared
space
then
i
went
over
to
the
main
door
and
hooked
it
open
so
that
the
hook
would
have
to
be
lifted
out
of
the
hasp
before
the
door
could
be
closed
after
that
i
placed
lighted
candles
before
each
of
the
sealed
doors
and
one
in
each
corner
of
the
big
room
and
then
i
lit
the
fire
when
i
saw
that
it
was
properly
alight
i
got
all
the
men
together
by
the
pile
of
things
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
took
their
pipes
from
them
for
as
the
sigsand
has
it
must
noe
lyght
come
from
wythin
the
barryier
and
i
was
going
to
make
sure
i
got
my
tape
measure
then
and
measured
out
a
circle
feet
in
diameter
and
immediately
chalked
it
out
the
police
and
wentworth
were
tremendously
interested
and
i
took
the
opportunity
to
warn
them
that
this
was
no
piece
of
silly
mumming
on
my
part
but
done
with
a
definite
intention
of
erecting
a
barrier
between
us
and
any
thing
that
the
night
might
show
to
us
i
warned
them
that
as
they
valued
their
lives
and
more
than
their
lives
it
might
be
no
one
must
on
any
account
whatsoever
pass
beyond
the
limits
of
the
barrier
that
i
was
making
after
i
had
drawn
the
circle
i
took
a
bunch
of
the
garlic
and
smudged
it
right
the
chalk
circle
a
little
outside
of
it
when
this
was
complete
i
called
for
candles
from
my
stock
of
material
i
set
the
police
to
lighting
them
and
as
they
were
lit
i
took
them
and
sealed
them
down
on
the
floor
just
within
the
chalk
circle
five
inches
apart
as
each
candle
measured
approximately
one
inch
in
diameter
it
took
candles
to
complete
the
circle
and
i
need
hardly
say
that
every
number
and
measurement
has
a
significance
then
from
candle
to
candle
i
took
a
of
human
hair
entwining
it
alternately
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
until
the
circle
was
completed
and
the
ends
of
the
hair
shod
with
silver
and
pressed
into
the
wax
of
the
candle
it
had
now
been
dark
some
time
and
i
made
haste
to
get
the
complete
to
this
end
i
got
the
men
well
together
and
began
to
fit
the
electric
pentacle
right
around
us
so
that
the
five
points
of
the
defensive
star
came
just
within
the
hair
circle
this
did
not
take
me
long
and
a
minute
later
i
had
connected
up
the
batteries
and
the
weak
blue
glare
of
the
intertwining
vacuum
tubes
shone
all
around
us
i
felt
happier
then
for
this
pentacle
is
as
you
all
know
a
wonderful
i
have
told
you
before
how
the
idea
came
to
me
after
reading
professor
garder
with
a
medium
he
found
that
a
current
of
a
certain
number
of
vibrations
vacuo
the
medium
it
is
difficult
to
suggest
an
explanation
and
if
you
are
really
interested
you
should
read
carder
lecture
on
vibrations
compared
with
vibrations
below
the
limit
as
i
stood
up
from
my
work
i
could
hear
outside
in
the
night
a
constant
drip
from
the
laurels
which
as
i
have
said
come
right
up
around
the
house
very
thick
by
the
sound
i
knew
that
a
rain
had
set
in
and
there
was
absolutely
no
wind
as
i
could
tell
by
the
steady
flames
of
the
candles
i
stood
a
moment
or
two
listening
and
then
one
of
the
men
touched
my
arm
and
asked
me
in
a
low
voice
what
they
should
do
by
his
tone
i
could
tell
that
he
was
feeling
something
of
the
strangeness
of
it
all
and
the
other
men
including
wentworth
were
so
quiet
that
i
was
afraid
they
were
beginning
to
get
shaky
i
then
and
arranged
them
with
their
backs
to
one
common
center
so
that
they
were
sitting
flat
upon
the
floor
with
their
feet
radiating
outward
then
by
compass
i
laid
their
legs
to
the
eight
chief
points
and
afterward
i
drew
a
circle
with
chalk
around
them
and
opposite
to
their
feet
i
made
the
eight
signs
of
the
saaamaaa
ritual
the
eighth
place
was
of
course
empty
but
ready
for
me
to
occupy
at
any
moment
for
i
had
omitted
to
make
the
sealing
sign
to
that
point
until
i
had
finished
all
my
preparations
and
could
enter
the
inner
star
i
took
a
last
look
the
great
hall
and
saw
that
the
two
big
hounds
were
lying
quietly
with
their
noses
between
their
paws
the
fire
was
big
and
cheerful
and
the
candles
before
the
two
rows
of
doors
burnt
steadily
as
well
as
the
solitary
ones
in
the
corners
then
i
went
the
little
star
of
men
and
warned
them
not
to
be
frightened
whatever
happened
but
to
trust
to
the
and
to
let
nothing
tempt
or
drive
them
to
cross
the
barriers
also
i
told
them
to
watch
their
movements
and
to
keep
their
feet
strictly
to
their
places
for
the
rest
there
was
to
be
no
shooting
unless
i
gave
the
word
and
now
at
last
i
went
to
my
place
and
sitting
down
made
the
eighth
sign
just
beyond
my
feet
then
i
arranged
my
camera
and
flashlight
handy
and
examined
my
revolver
wentworth
sat
behind
the
first
sign
and
as
the
numbering
went
reversed
that
put
him
next
to
me
on
my
left
i
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
how
he
felt
and
he
told
me
rather
nervous
but
that
he
felt
confidence
in
my
knowledge
and
was
resolved
to
go
through
with
the
matter
whatever
happened
we
settled
down
to
wait
there
was
no
talking
except
that
once
or
twice
the
police
bent
toward
one
another
and
whispered
odd
remarks
concerning
the
hall
that
appeared
queerly
audible
in
the
intense
silence
but
in
a
while
there
was
not
even
a
whisper
from
anyone
and
only
the
monotonous
drip
drip
of
the
quiet
rain
without
the
great
entrance
and
the
low
dull
sound
of
the
fire
in
the
big
fireplace
it
was
a
queer
group
that
we
made
sitting
there
back
to
back
with
our
legs
starred
outward
and
all
around
us
the
strange
blue
glow
of
the
pentacle
and
beyond
that
the
brilliant
shining
of
the
great
ring
of
lighted
candles
outside
of
the
glare
of
the
candles
the
large
empty
hall
looked
a
little
gloomy
by
contrast
except
where
the
lights
shone
before
the
sealed
doors
and
the
blaze
of
the
big
fire
made
a
good
honest
mass
of
flame
and
the
feeling
of
mystery
can
you
picture
it
all
it
might
have
been
an
hour
later
that
it
came
to
me
suddenly
that
i
was
aware
of
an
extraordinary
sense
of
dreeness
as
it
were
come
into
the
air
of
the
place
not
the
nervous
feeling
of
mystery
that
had
been
with
us
all
the
time
but
a
new
feeling
as
if
there
were
something
going
to
happen
any
moment
abruptly
there
came
a
slight
noise
from
the
east
end
of
the
hall
and
i
felt
the
star
of
men
move
suddenly
keep
steady
i
shouted
and
they
quietened
i
looked
up
the
hall
and
saw
that
the
dogs
were
upon
their
feet
and
staring
in
an
extraordinary
fashion
toward
the
great
entrance
i
turned
and
stared
also
and
felt
the
men
move
as
they
craned
their
heads
to
look
suddenly
the
dogs
set
up
a
tremendous
barking
and
i
glanced
across
to
them
and
found
they
were
still
for
the
big
doorway
they
ceased
their
noise
just
as
quickly
and
seemed
to
be
listening
in
the
same
instant
i
heard
a
faint
chink
of
metal
to
my
left
that
set
me
staring
at
the
hook
which
held
the
great
door
wide
it
moved
even
as
i
looked
some
invisible
thing
was
meddling
with
it
a
queer
sickening
thrill
went
through
me
and
i
felt
all
the
men
about
me
stiffen
and
go
rigid
with
intensity
i
had
a
certainty
of
something
impending
as
it
might
be
the
impression
of
an
invisible
but
overwhelming
presence
the
hall
was
full
of
a
queer
silence
and
not
a
sound
came
from
the
dogs
i
saw
the
hook
slowly
raised
from
out
of
its
hasp
without
any
visible
thing
touching
then
a
sudden
power
of
movement
came
to
me
i
raised
my
camera
with
the
flashlight
fixed
and
snapped
it
at
the
door
there
came
the
great
blare
of
the
flashlight
and
a
simultaneous
roar
of
barking
from
the
two
dogs
the
intensity
of
the
flash
made
all
the
place
seem
dark
for
some
moments
and
in
that
time
of
darkness
i
heard
a
jingle
in
the
direction
of
the
door
and
strained
to
look
the
effect
of
the
bright
light
passed
and
i
could
see
clearly
again
the
great
entrance
door
was
being
slowly
closed
it
shut
with
a
sharp
snick
and
there
followed
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
the
whimpering
of
the
dogs
i
turned
suddenly
and
looked
at
wentworth
he
was
looking
at
me
as
it
did
before
he
whispered
extraordinary
i
said
and
he
nodded
and
looked
nervously
the
policemen
were
pretty
quiet
and
i
judged
that
they
were
feeling
rather
worse
than
wentworth
though
for
that
matter
you
must
not
think
that
i
was
altogether
natural
yet
i
have
seen
so
much
that
is
extraordinary
that
i
daresay
i
can
keep
my
nerves
steady
longer
than
most
people
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
at
the
men
and
cautioned
them
in
a
low
voice
not
to
move
outside
of
the
barriers
not
even
though
the
house
should
seem
to
be
rocking
and
about
to
tumble
on
to
them
for
well
i
knew
what
some
of
the
great
forces
are
capable
of
doing
yet
unless
it
should
prove
to
be
one
of
the
cases
of
the
more
terrible
saiitii
manifestation
we
were
almost
certain
of
safety
so
long
as
we
kept
to
our
order
within
the
pentacle
perhaps
an
hour
and
a
half
passed
quietly
except
when
once
in
a
way
the
dogs
would
whine
distressfully
presently
however
they
ceased
even
from
this
and
i
could
see
them
lying
on
the
floor
with
their
paws
over
their
noses
in
a
most
peculiar
fashion
and
shivering
visibly
the
sight
made
me
feel
more
serious
as
you
can
understand
suddenly
the
candle
in
the
corner
furthest
from
the
main
door
went
out
an
instant
later
wentworth
jerked
my
arm
and
i
saw
that
the
candle
before
one
of
the
sealed
doors
had
been
put
out
i
held
my
camera
ready
then
one
after
another
every
candle
about
the
hall
was
put
out
and
with
such
speed
and
irregularity
that
i
could
never
catch
one
in
the
actual
act
of
being
extinguished
yet
for
all
that
i
took
a
flashlight
of
the
hall
in
general
there
was
a
time
in
which
i
sat
by
the
great
glare
of
the
flash
and
i
blamed
myself
for
not
having
remembered
to
bring
a
pair
of
smoked
goggles
which
i
have
sometimes
used
at
these
times
i
had
felt
the
men
jump
at
the
sudden
light
and
i
called
out
loud
to
them
to
sit
quiet
and
to
keep
their
feet
exactly
to
their
proper
places
my
voice
as
you
can
imagine
sounded
rather
horrid
and
frightening
in
the
great
room
and
altogether
it
was
a
beastly
moment
then
i
was
able
to
see
again
and
i
stared
here
and
there
about
the
hall
but
there
was
nothing
showing
unusual
only
of
course
it
was
dark
now
over
in
the
corners
suddenly
i
saw
that
the
great
fire
was
blackening
it
was
going
out
visibly
as
i
looked
if
i
said
that
some
monstrous
invisible
impossible
creature
sucked
the
life
from
it
i
could
best
explain
the
way
the
light
and
flame
went
out
of
it
it
was
most
extraordinary
to
watch
in
the
time
that
i
watched
it
every
vestige
of
fire
was
gone
from
it
and
there
was
no
light
outside
of
the
ring
of
candles
around
the
pentacle
the
deliberateness
of
the
thing
troubled
me
more
than
i
can
make
clear
to
you
it
conveyed
to
me
such
a
sense
of
a
calm
deliberate
force
present
in
the
hall
the
steadfast
intention
to
a
darkness
was
horrible
the
of
the
power
to
affect
the
material
was
horrible
the
extent
of
the
power
to
affect
the
material
was
now
the
one
constant
anxious
questioning
in
my
brain
you
can
understand
behind
me
i
heard
the
policemen
moving
again
and
i
knew
that
they
were
getting
thoroughly
frightened
i
turned
half
and
told
them
quietly
but
plainly
that
they
were
safe
only
so
long
as
they
stayed
within
the
pentacle
in
the
position
in
which
i
had
put
them
if
they
once
broke
and
went
outside
of
the
barrier
no
knowledge
of
mine
could
state
the
full
extent
of
the
dreadfulness
of
the
danger
i
steadied
them
up
by
this
quiet
straight
reminder
but
if
they
had
known
as
i
knew
that
there
is
no
certainty
in
any
they
would
have
suffered
a
great
deal
more
and
probably
have
broken
the
and
made
a
mad
foolish
run
for
an
impossible
safety
another
hour
passed
after
this
in
an
absolute
quietness
i
had
a
sense
of
awful
strain
and
oppression
as
though
i
were
a
little
spirit
in
the
company
of
some
invisible
brooding
monster
of
the
unseen
world
who
as
yet
was
scarcely
conscious
of
us
i
leant
across
to
wentworth
and
asked
him
in
a
whisper
whether
he
had
a
feeling
as
if
something
were
in
the
room
he
looked
very
pale
and
his
eyes
kept
always
on
the
move
he
glanced
just
once
at
me
and
nodded
then
stared
away
the
hall
again
and
when
i
came
to
think
i
was
doing
the
same
thing
abruptly
as
though
a
hundred
unseen
hands
had
snuffed
them
every
candle
in
the
barrier
went
dead
out
and
we
were
left
in
a
darkness
that
seemed
for
a
little
absolute
for
the
light
from
the
pentacle
was
too
weak
and
pale
to
penetrate
far
across
the
great
hall
i
tell
you
for
a
moment
i
just
sat
there
as
though
i
had
been
frozen
solid
i
felt
the
go
all
over
me
and
seem
to
stop
in
my
brain
i
felt
all
at
once
to
be
given
a
power
of
hearing
that
was
far
beyond
the
normal
i
could
hear
my
own
heart
thudding
most
extraordinarily
loud
i
began
however
to
feel
better
after
a
while
but
i
simply
had
not
the
pluck
to
move
you
can
understand
presently
i
began
to
get
my
courage
back
i
gripped
at
my
camera
and
flashlight
and
waited
my
hands
were
simply
soaked
with
sweat
i
glanced
once
at
wentworth
i
could
see
him
only
dimly
his
shoulders
were
hunched
a
little
his
head
forward
but
though
it
was
motionless
i
knew
that
his
eyes
were
not
it
is
queer
how
one
knows
that
sort
of
thing
at
times
the
police
were
just
as
silent
and
thus
a
while
passed
a
sudden
sound
broke
across
the
silence
from
two
sides
of
the
room
there
came
faint
noises
i
recognized
them
at
once
as
the
breaking
of
the
sealed
doors
were
i
raised
the
camera
and
flashlight
and
it
was
a
peculiar
mixture
of
fear
and
courage
that
helped
me
to
press
the
button
as
the
great
flare
of
light
lit
up
the
hall
i
felt
the
men
all
about
me
jump
the
darkness
fell
like
a
clap
of
thunder
if
you
can
understand
and
seemed
tenfold
yet
in
the
moment
of
brightness
i
had
seen
that
all
the
sealed
doors
were
wide
open
suddenly
all
around
us
there
sounded
a
drip
drip
drip
upon
the
floor
of
the
great
hall
i
thrilled
with
a
queer
realizing
emotion
and
a
sense
of
a
very
real
and
present
danger
the
had
commenced
and
the
grim
question
was
now
whether
the
barriers
could
save
us
from
whatever
had
come
into
the
huge
room
through
some
awful
minutes
the
continued
to
fall
in
an
increasing
rain
and
presently
some
began
to
fall
within
the
barriers
i
saw
several
great
drops
splash
and
star
upon
the
pale
glowing
intertwining
tubes
of
the
electric
pentacle
but
strangely
enough
i
could
not
trace
that
any
fell
among
us
beyond
the
strange
horrible
noise
of
the
there
was
no
other
sound
and
then
abruptly
from
the
boarhound
over
in
the
far
corner
there
came
a
terrible
yelling
howl
of
agony
followed
instantly
by
a
sickening
breaking
noise
and
an
immediate
silence
if
you
have
ever
when
out
shooting
broken
a
neck
you
will
know
the
sound
in
miniature
like
lightning
the
thought
sprang
into
my
brain
has
crossed
the
for
you
will
remember
that
i
had
made
one
about
each
of
the
dogs
i
thought
instantly
with
a
sick
apprehension
of
our
own
barriers
there
was
something
in
the
hall
with
us
that
had
passed
the
barrier
of
the
pentacle
about
one
of
the
dogs
in
the
awful
succeeding
silence
i
positively
quivered
and
suddenly
one
of
the
men
behind
me
gave
out
a
scream
like
any
woman
and
bolted
for
the
door
he
fumbled
and
had
it
open
in
a
moment
i
yelled
to
the
others
not
to
move
but
they
followed
like
sheep
and
i
heard
them
kick
the
candles
flying
in
their
panic
one
of
them
stepped
on
the
electric
pentacle
and
smashed
it
and
there
was
an
utter
darkness
in
an
instant
i
realized
that
i
was
defenseless
against
the
powers
of
the
unknown
world
and
with
one
savage
leap
i
was
out
of
the
useless
barriers
and
instantly
through
the
great
doorway
and
into
the
night
i
believe
i
yelled
with
sheer
funk
the
men
were
a
little
ahead
of
me
and
i
never
ceased
running
and
neither
did
they
sometimes
i
glanced
back
over
my
shoulder
and
i
kept
glancing
into
the
laurels
which
grew
all
along
the
drive
the
beastly
things
kept
rustling
rustling
in
a
hollow
sort
of
way
as
though
something
were
keeping
parallel
with
me
among
them
the
rain
had
stopped
and
a
dismal
little
wind
kept
moaning
through
the
grounds
it
was
disgusting
i
caught
wentworth
and
the
police
at
the
lodge
gate
we
got
outside
and
ran
all
the
way
to
the
village
we
found
old
dennis
up
waiting
for
us
and
half
the
villagers
to
keep
him
company
he
told
us
that
he
had
known
in
his
that
we
should
come
back
that
is
if
we
came
back
at
all
which
is
not
a
bad
rendering
of
his
remark
fortunately
i
had
brought
my
camera
away
from
the
house
possibly
because
the
strap
had
happened
to
be
over
my
head
yet
i
did
not
go
straight
away
to
develop
but
sat
with
the
rest
of
the
bar
where
we
talked
for
some
hours
trying
to
be
coherent
about
the
whole
horrible
business
later
however
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
proceeded
with
my
photography
i
was
steadier
now
and
it
was
just
possible
so
i
hoped
that
the
negatives
might
show
something
on
two
of
the
plates
i
found
nothing
unusual
but
on
the
third
which
was
the
first
one
that
i
snapped
i
saw
something
that
made
me
quite
excited
i
examined
it
very
carefully
with
a
magnifying
glass
then
i
put
it
to
wash
and
slipped
a
pair
of
rubber
overshoes
over
my
boots
the
negative
had
showed
me
something
very
extraordinary
and
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
test
the
truth
of
what
it
seemed
to
indicate
without
losing
another
moment
it
was
no
use
telling
anything
to
wentworth
and
the
police
until
i
was
certain
and
also
i
believed
that
i
stood
a
greater
chance
to
succeed
by
myself
though
for
that
matter
i
do
not
suppose
anything
would
have
taken
them
up
to
the
manor
again
that
night
i
took
my
revolver
and
went
quietly
downstairs
and
into
the
dark
the
rain
had
commenced
again
but
that
did
not
bother
me
i
walked
hard
when
i
came
to
the
lodge
gates
a
sudden
queer
instinct
stopped
me
from
going
through
and
i
climbed
the
wall
into
the
park
i
kept
away
from
the
drive
and
approached
the
building
through
the
dismal
dripping
laurels
you
can
imagine
how
beastly
it
was
every
time
a
leaf
rustled
i
jumped
i
made
my
way
to
the
back
of
the
big
house
and
got
in
through
a
little
window
which
i
had
taken
note
of
during
my
search
for
of
course
i
knew
the
whole
place
from
roof
to
cellars
i
went
silently
up
the
kitchen
stairs
fairly
quivering
with
funk
and
at
the
top
i
went
to
the
left
and
then
into
a
long
corridor
that
opened
through
one
of
the
doorways
we
had
sealed
into
the
big
hall
i
looked
up
it
and
saw
a
faint
flicker
of
light
away
at
the
end
and
i
tiptoed
silently
toward
it
holding
my
revolver
ready
as
i
came
near
to
the
open
door
i
heard
voices
and
then
a
burst
of
laughing
i
went
on
until
i
could
see
into
the
hall
there
were
several
men
there
all
in
a
group
they
were
well
dressed
and
one
at
least
i
saw
was
armed
they
were
examining
my
against
the
supernatural
with
a
good
deal
of
unkind
laughter
i
never
felt
such
a
fool
in
my
life
it
was
plain
to
me
that
they
were
a
gang
of
men
who
had
made
use
of
the
empty
manor
perhaps
for
years
for
some
purpose
of
their
own
and
now
that
wentworth
was
attempting
to
take
possession
they
were
acting
up
the
traditions
of
the
place
with
the
view
of
driving
him
away
and
keeping
so
useful
a
place
still
at
their
disposal
but
what
they
were
i
mean
whether
coiners
thieves
inventors
or
what
i
could
not
imagine
presently
they
left
the
pentacle
and
gathered
the
living
boarhound
which
seemed
curiously
quiet
as
though
it
were
there
was
some
talk
as
to
whether
to
let
the
poor
brute
live
or
not
but
finally
they
decided
it
would
be
good
policy
to
kill
it
i
saw
two
of
them
force
a
twisted
loop
of
rope
into
its
mouth
and
the
two
bights
of
the
loop
were
brought
together
at
the
back
of
the
hound
neck
then
a
third
man
thrust
a
thick
through
the
two
loops
the
two
men
with
the
rope
stooped
to
hold
the
dog
so
that
i
could
not
see
what
was
done
but
the
poor
beast
gave
a
sudden
awful
howl
and
immediately
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
uncomfortable
breaking
sound
i
had
heard
earlier
in
the
night
as
you
will
remember
the
men
stood
up
and
left
the
dog
lying
there
quiet
enough
now
as
you
may
suppose
for
my
part
i
fully
appreciated
the
calculated
remorselessness
which
had
decided
upon
the
animal
death
and
the
cold
determination
with
which
it
had
been
afterward
executed
so
neatly
i
guessed
that
a
man
who
might
get
into
the
of
those
particular
men
would
be
likely
to
come
to
quite
as
uncomfortable
an
ending
a
minute
later
one
of
the
men
called
out
to
the
rest
that
they
should
the
wires
one
of
the
men
came
toward
the
doorway
of
the
corridor
in
which
i
stood
and
i
ran
quickly
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
upper
end
i
saw
the
man
reach
up
and
take
something
from
the
top
of
the
door
and
i
heard
the
slight
ringing
jangle
of
steel
wire
when
he
had
gone
i
ran
back
again
and
saw
the
men
passing
one
after
another
through
an
opening
in
the
stairs
formed
by
one
of
the
marble
steps
being
raised
when
the
last
man
had
vanished
the
slab
that
made
the
step
was
shut
down
and
there
was
not
a
sign
of
the
secret
door
it
was
the
seventh
step
from
the
bottom
as
i
took
care
to
count
and
a
splendid
idea
for
it
was
so
solid
that
it
did
not
ring
hollow
even
to
a
fairly
heavy
hammer
as
i
found
later
there
is
little
more
to
tell
i
got
out
of
the
house
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
possible
and
back
to
the
inn
the
police
came
without
any
coaxing
when
they
knew
the
were
normal
flesh
and
blood
we
entered
the
park
and
the
manor
in
the
same
way
that
i
had
done
yet
when
we
tried
to
open
the
step
we
failed
and
had
finally
to
smash
it
this
must
have
warned
the
haunters
for
when
we
descended
to
a
secret
room
which
we
found
at
the
end
of
a
long
and
narrow
passage
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
we
found
no
one
the
police
were
horribly
disgusted
as
you
can
imagine
but
for
my
part
i
did
not
care
either
way
i
had
the
ghost
as
you
might
say
and
that
was
what
i
set
out
to
do
i
was
not
particularly
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
by
the
others
for
they
had
all
been
thoroughly
in
and
in
the
end
i
had
scored
without
their
help
we
searched
right
through
the
secret
ways
and
found
that
there
was
an
exit
at
the
end
of
a
long
tunnel
which
opened
in
the
side
of
a
well
out
in
the
grounds
the
ceiling
of
the
hall
was
hollow
and
reached
by
a
little
secret
stairway
inside
of
the
big
staircase
the
was
merely
colored
water
dropped
through
the
minute
crevices
of
the
ornamented
ceiling
how
the
candles
and
the
fire
were
put
out
i
do
not
know
for
the
haunters
certainly
did
not
act
quite
up
to
tradition
which
held
that
the
lights
were
put
out
by
the
perhaps
it
was
too
difficult
to
direct
the
fluid
without
positively
squirting
it
which
might
have
given
the
whole
thing
away
the
candles
and
the
fire
may
possibly
have
been
extinguished
by
the
agency
of
carbonic
acid
gas
but
how
suspended
i
have
no
idea
the
secret
hiding
paces
were
of
course
ancient
there
was
also
did
i
tell
you
a
bell
which
they
had
rigged
up
to
ring
when
anyone
entered
the
gates
at
the
end
of
the
drive
if
i
had
not
climbed
the
wall
i
should
have
found
nothing
for
my
pains
for
the
bell
would
have
warned
them
had
i
gone
in
through
the
gateway
what
was
on
the
negative
i
asked
with
much
curiosity
a
picture
of
the
fine
wire
with
which
they
were
grappling
for
the
hook
that
held
the
entrance
door
open
they
were
doing
it
from
one
of
the
crevices
in
the
ceiling
they
had
evidently
made
no
preparations
for
lifting
the
hook
i
suppose
they
never
thought
that
anyone
would
make
use
of
it
and
so
they
had
to
improvise
a
grapple
the
wire
was
too
fine
to
be
seen
by
the
amount
of
light
we
had
in
the
hall
but
the
flashlight
it
out
do
you
see
the
opening
of
the
inner
doors
was
managed
by
wires
as
you
will
have
guessed
which
they
unshipped
after
use
or
else
i
should
soon
have
found
them
when
i
made
my
search
i
think
i
have
now
explained
everything
the
hound
was
killed
of
course
by
the
men
direct
you
see
they
made
the
place
as
dark
as
possible
first
of
course
if
i
had
managed
to
take
a
flashlight
just
at
that
instant
the
whole
secret
of
the
haunting
would
have
been
exposed
but
fate
just
ordered
it
the
other
way
and
the
tramps
i
asked
oh
you
mean
the
two
tramps
who
were
found
dead
in
the
manor
said
carnacki
well
of
course
it
is
impossible
to
be
sure
one
way
or
the
other
perhaps
they
happened
to
find
out
something
and
were
given
a
hypodermic
or
it
is
just
as
probable
that
they
had
come
to
the
time
of
their
dying
and
just
died
naturally
it
is
conceivable
that
a
great
many
tramps
had
slept
in
the
old
house
at
one
time
or
another
carnacki
stood
up
and
knocked
out
his
pipe
we
rose
also
and
went
for
our
coats
and
hats
out
you
go
said
carnacki
genially
using
the
recognized
formula
and
we
went
out
on
to
the
embankment
and
presently
through
the
darkness
to
our
various
homes
no
the
whistling
room
carnacki
shook
a
friendly
fist
at
me
as
i
entered
late
then
he
opened
the
door
into
the
dining
room
and
ushered
the
four
of
us
jessop
arkright
taylor
and
myself
in
to
dinner
we
dined
well
as
usual
and
equally
as
usual
carnacki
was
pretty
silent
during
the
meal
at
the
end
we
took
our
wine
and
cigars
to
our
usual
positions
and
carnacki
having
got
himself
comfortable
in
his
big
chair
began
without
any
preliminary
i
have
just
got
back
from
ireland
again
he
said
and
i
thought
you
chaps
would
be
interested
to
hear
my
news
besides
i
fancy
i
shall
see
the
thing
clearer
after
i
have
told
it
all
out
straight
i
must
tell
you
this
though
at
the
beginning
up
to
the
present
moment
i
have
been
utterly
and
completely
i
have
tumbled
upon
one
of
the
most
peculiar
cases
of
or
devilment
of
some
sort
that
i
have
come
against
now
listen
i
have
been
spending
the
last
few
weeks
at
iastrae
castle
about
twenty
miles
northeast
of
galway
i
got
a
letter
about
a
month
ago
from
a
sid
tassoc
who
it
seemed
had
bought
the
place
lately
and
moved
in
only
to
find
that
he
had
bought
a
very
peculiar
piece
of
property
when
i
got
there
he
met
me
at
the
station
driving
a
jaunting
car
and
drove
me
up
to
the
castle
which
by
the
way
he
called
a
shanty
i
found
that
he
was
it
there
with
his
boy
brother
and
another
american
who
seemed
to
be
and
it
seems
that
all
the
servants
had
left
the
place
in
a
body
as
you
might
say
and
now
they
were
managing
among
themselves
assisted
by
some
the
three
of
them
got
together
a
scratch
feed
and
tassoc
told
me
all
about
the
trouble
whilst
we
were
at
table
it
is
most
extraordinary
and
different
from
anything
that
i
have
had
to
do
with
though
that
buzzing
case
was
very
queer
too
tassoc
began
right
in
the
middle
of
his
story
got
a
room
in
this
shanty
he
said
has
got
a
most
infernal
whistling
in
it
sort
of
haunting
it
the
thing
starts
any
time
you
never
know
when
and
it
goes
on
until
it
frightens
you
all
the
servants
have
gone
as
you
know
not
ordinary
whistling
and
it
is
the
wind
wait
till
you
hear
it
all
carrying
guns
said
the
boy
and
slapped
his
coat
pocket
bad
as
that
i
said
and
the
older
boy
nodded
may
be
soft
he
replied
wait
till
you
heard
it
sometimes
i
think
it
some
infernal
thing
and
the
next
moment
i
just
as
sure
that
playing
a
trick
on
me
i
asked
is
to
be
gained
mean
he
said
people
usually
have
some
good
reason
for
playing
tricks
as
elaborate
as
this
well
i
tell
you
there
a
lady
in
this
province
by
the
name
of
miss
donnehue
who
going
to
be
my
wife
this
day
two
months
she
more
beautiful
than
they
make
them
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
i
just
stuck
my
head
into
an
irish
hornet
nest
there
about
a
score
of
hot
young
irishmen
been
courting
her
these
two
years
gone
and
now
that
i
come
along
and
cut
them
out
they
feel
raw
against
me
do
you
begin
to
understand
the
possibilities
i
said
i
do
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
but
i
do
see
how
all
this
affects
the
room
this
he
said
i
fixed
it
up
with
miss
donnehue
i
looked
out
for
a
place
and
bought
this
little
house
shanty
afterward
i
told
her
one
evening
during
dinner
that
i
decided
to
tie
up
here
and
then
she
asked
me
whether
i
was
afraid
of
the
whistling
room
i
told
her
it
must
have
been
thrown
in
gratis
as
i
heard
nothing
about
it
there
were
some
of
her
men
friends
present
and
i
saw
a
smile
go
i
found
out
after
a
bit
of
questioning
that
several
people
have
bought
this
place
during
the
last
years
and
it
was
always
on
the
market
again
after
a
trial
the
chaps
started
to
bait
me
a
bit
and
offered
to
take
bets
after
dinner
that
i
not
stay
six
months
in
the
place
i
looked
once
or
twice
to
miss
donnehue
so
as
to
be
sure
i
was
getting
the
note
of
the
but
i
could
see
that
she
did
take
it
as
a
joke
at
all
partly
i
think
because
there
was
a
bit
of
a
sneer
in
the
way
the
men
were
tackling
me
and
partly
because
she
really
believes
there
is
something
in
this
yarn
of
the
whistling
room
after
dinner
i
did
what
i
could
to
even
things
up
with
the
others
i
nailed
all
their
bets
and
screwed
them
down
hard
and
safe
i
guess
some
of
them
are
going
to
be
hard
hit
unless
i
lose
which
i
mean
to
well
there
you
have
practically
the
whole
yarn
quite
i
told
him
that
i
know
is
that
you
have
bought
a
castle
with
a
room
in
it
that
is
in
some
way
queer
and
that
been
doing
some
betting
also
i
know
that
your
servants
have
got
frightened
and
run
away
tell
me
something
about
the
whistling
that
said
tassoc
started
the
second
night
we
were
in
had
a
good
look
the
room
in
the
daytime
as
you
can
understand
for
the
talk
up
at
arlestrae
miss
donnehue
place
had
made
me
wonder
a
bit
but
it
seems
just
as
usual
as
some
of
the
other
rooms
in
the
old
wing
only
perhaps
a
bit
more
lonesome
but
that
may
be
only
because
of
the
talk
about
it
you
know
whistling
started
about
ten
on
the
second
night
as
i
said
tom
and
i
were
in
the
library
when
we
heard
an
awfully
queer
whistling
coming
along
the
east
corridor
the
room
is
in
the
east
wing
you
know
that
blessed
ghost
i
said
to
tom
and
we
collared
the
lamps
off
the
table
and
went
up
to
have
a
look
i
tell
you
even
as
we
dug
along
the
corridor
it
took
me
a
bit
in
the
throat
it
was
so
beastly
queer
it
was
a
sort
of
tune
in
a
way
but
more
as
if
a
devil
or
some
rotten
thing
were
laughing
at
you
and
going
to
get
at
your
back
that
how
it
makes
you
feel
we
got
to
the
door
we
did
wait
but
rushed
it
open
and
then
i
tell
you
the
sound
of
the
thing
fairly
hit
me
in
the
face
tom
said
he
got
it
the
same
way
sort
of
felt
stunned
and
bewildered
we
looked
all
and
soon
got
so
nervous
we
just
cleared
out
and
i
locked
the
door
came
down
here
and
had
a
stiff
peg
each
then
we
got
fit
again
and
began
to
think
we
been
nicely
had
so
we
took
sticks
and
went
out
into
the
grounds
thinking
after
all
it
must
be
some
of
these
confounded
irishmen
working
the
on
us
but
there
was
not
a
leg
stirring
went
back
into
the
house
and
walked
over
it
and
then
paid
another
visit
to
the
room
but
we
simply
could
stand
it
we
fairly
ran
out
and
locked
the
door
again
i
do
know
how
to
put
it
into
words
but
i
had
a
feeling
of
being
up
against
something
that
was
rottenly
dangerous
you
know
we
carried
our
guns
ever
since
course
we
had
a
real
turn
out
of
the
room
next
day
and
the
whole
house
place
and
we
even
hunted
the
grounds
but
there
was
nothing
queer
and
now
i
do
know
what
to
think
except
that
the
sensible
part
of
me
tells
me
that
it
some
plan
of
these
wild
irishmen
to
try
to
take
a
rise
out
of
me
anything
since
i
asked
him
he
said
outside
of
the
door
of
the
room
at
nights
and
chased
the
grounds
and
sounded
the
walls
and
floor
of
the
room
we
done
everything
we
could
think
of
and
it
beginning
to
get
on
our
nerves
so
we
sent
for
you
by
this
we
had
finished
eating
as
we
rose
from
the
table
tassoc
suddenly
called
out
hark
we
were
instantly
silent
listening
then
i
heard
it
an
extraordinary
hooning
whistle
monstrous
and
inhuman
coming
from
far
away
through
corridors
to
my
right
g
d
said
tassoc
it
scarcely
dark
yet
collar
those
candles
both
of
you
and
come
along
in
a
few
moments
we
were
all
out
of
the
door
and
racing
up
the
stairs
tassoc
turned
into
a
long
corridor
and
we
followed
shielding
our
candles
as
we
ran
the
sound
seemed
to
fill
all
the
passage
as
we
drew
near
until
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
whole
air
throbbed
under
the
power
of
some
wanton
immense
force
a
sense
of
an
actual
taint
as
you
might
say
of
monstrosity
all
about
us
tassoc
unlocked
the
door
then
giving
it
a
push
with
his
foot
jumped
back
and
drew
his
revolver
as
the
door
flew
open
the
sound
beat
out
at
us
with
an
effect
impossible
to
explain
to
one
who
has
not
heard
it
with
a
certain
horrible
personal
note
in
it
as
if
in
there
in
the
darkness
you
could
picture
the
room
rocking
and
creaking
in
a
mad
vile
glee
to
its
own
filthy
piping
and
whistling
and
hooning
to
stand
there
and
listen
was
to
be
stunned
by
realization
it
was
as
if
someone
showed
you
the
mouth
of
a
vast
pit
suddenly
and
said
that
hell
and
you
knew
that
they
had
spoken
the
truth
do
you
get
it
even
a
little
bit
i
stepped
back
a
pace
into
the
room
and
held
the
candle
over
my
head
and
looked
quickly
tassoc
and
his
brother
joined
me
and
the
man
came
up
at
the
back
and
we
all
held
our
candles
high
i
was
deafened
with
the
shrill
piping
hoon
of
the
whistling
and
then
clear
in
my
ear
something
seemed
to
be
saying
to
me
out
of
here
quick
quick
quick
as
you
chaps
know
i
never
neglect
that
sort
of
thing
sometimes
it
may
be
nothing
but
nerves
but
as
you
will
remember
it
was
just
such
a
warning
that
saved
me
in
the
dog
case
and
in
the
experiments
as
well
as
other
times
well
i
turned
sharp
to
the
others
i
said
god
sake
quick
and
in
an
instant
i
had
them
into
the
passage
there
came
an
extraordinary
yelling
scream
into
the
hideous
whistling
and
then
like
a
clap
of
thunder
an
utter
silence
i
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
then
taking
the
key
i
looked
at
the
others
they
were
pretty
white
and
i
imagine
i
must
have
looked
that
way
too
and
there
we
stood
a
moment
silent
down
out
of
this
and
have
some
whisky
said
tassoc
at
last
in
a
voice
he
tried
to
make
ordinary
and
he
led
the
way
i
was
the
back
man
and
i
know
we
all
kept
looking
over
our
shoulders
when
we
got
downstairs
tassoc
passed
the
bottle
he
took
a
drink
himself
and
slapped
his
glass
down
on
to
the
table
then
sat
down
with
a
thud
a
lovely
thing
to
have
in
the
house
with
you
is
it
he
said
and
directly
afterward
on
earth
made
you
hustle
us
all
out
like
that
carnacki
seemed
to
be
telling
me
to
get
out
quick
i
said
a
bit
silly
superstitious
i
know
but
when
you
are
meddling
with
this
sort
of
thing
you
got
to
take
notice
of
queer
fancies
and
risk
being
laughed
at
i
told
him
then
about
the
dog
business
and
he
nodded
a
lot
to
that
course
i
said
may
be
nothing
more
than
those
rivals
of
yours
playing
some
funny
game
but
personally
though
going
to
keep
an
open
mind
i
feel
that
there
is
something
beastly
and
dangerous
about
this
thing
we
talked
for
a
while
longer
and
then
tassoc
suggested
billiards
which
we
played
in
a
pretty
fashion
and
all
the
time
cocking
an
ear
to
the
door
as
you
might
say
for
sounds
but
none
came
and
later
after
coffee
he
suggested
early
bed
and
a
thorough
overhaul
of
the
room
on
the
morrow
my
bedroom
was
in
the
newer
part
of
the
castle
and
the
door
opened
into
the
picture
gallery
at
the
east
end
of
the
gallery
was
the
entrance
to
the
corridor
of
the
east
wing
this
was
shut
off
from
the
gallery
by
two
old
and
heavy
oak
doors
which
looked
rather
odd
and
quaint
beside
the
more
modern
doors
of
the
various
rooms
when
i
reached
my
room
i
did
not
go
to
bed
but
began
to
unpack
my
instrument
trunk
of
which
i
had
retained
the
key
i
intended
to
take
one
or
two
preliminary
steps
at
once
in
my
investigation
of
the
extraordinary
whistling
presently
when
the
castle
had
settled
into
quietness
i
slipped
out
of
my
room
and
across
to
the
entrance
of
the
great
corridor
i
opened
one
of
the
low
squat
doors
and
threw
the
beam
of
my
pocket
searchlight
down
the
passage
it
was
empty
and
i
went
through
the
doorway
and
the
oak
behind
me
then
along
the
great
passageway
throwing
my
light
before
and
behind
and
keeping
my
revolver
handy
i
had
hung
a
belt
of
garlic
my
neck
and
the
smell
of
it
seemed
to
fill
the
corridor
and
give
me
assurance
for
as
you
all
know
it
is
a
wonderful
against
the
more
usual
aeiirii
forms
of
by
which
i
supposed
the
whistling
might
be
produced
though
at
that
period
of
my
investigation
i
was
quite
prepared
to
find
it
due
to
some
perfectly
natural
cause
for
it
is
astonishing
the
enormous
number
of
cases
that
prove
to
have
nothing
abnormal
in
them
in
addition
to
wearing
the
necklet
i
had
plugged
my
ears
loosely
with
garlic
and
as
i
did
not
intend
to
stay
more
than
a
few
minutes
in
the
room
i
hoped
to
be
safe
when
i
reached
the
door
and
put
my
hand
into
my
pocket
for
the
key
i
had
a
sudden
feeling
of
sickening
funk
but
i
was
not
going
to
back
out
if
i
could
help
it
i
unlocked
the
door
and
turned
the
handle
then
i
gave
the
door
a
sharp
push
with
my
foot
as
tassoc
had
done
and
drew
my
revolver
though
i
did
not
expect
to
have
any
use
for
it
really
i
shone
the
searchlight
all
the
room
and
then
stepped
inside
with
a
disgustingly
horrible
feeling
of
walking
slap
into
a
waiting
danger
i
stood
a
few
seconds
waiting
and
nothing
happened
and
the
empty
room
showed
bare
from
corner
to
corner
and
then
you
know
i
realized
that
the
room
was
full
of
an
abominable
silence
can
you
understand
that
a
sort
of
purposeful
silence
just
as
sickening
as
any
of
the
filthy
noises
the
things
have
power
to
make
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
that
garden
business
well
this
room
had
just
that
same
silence
the
beastly
quietness
of
a
thing
that
is
looking
at
you
and
not
seeable
itself
and
thinks
that
it
has
got
you
oh
i
recognized
it
instantly
and
i
whipped
the
top
off
my
lantern
so
as
to
have
light
over
the
room
then
i
working
like
fury
and
keeping
my
glance
all
about
me
i
sealed
the
two
windows
with
lengths
of
human
hair
right
across
and
sealed
them
at
every
frame
as
i
worked
a
queer
scarcely
perceptible
tenseness
stole
into
the
air
of
the
place
and
the
silence
seemed
if
you
can
understand
me
to
grow
more
solid
i
knew
then
that
i
had
no
business
there
without
protection
for
i
was
practically
certain
that
this
was
no
mere
aeiirii
development
but
one
of
the
worst
forms
as
the
saiitii
like
that
man
case
you
know
i
finished
the
window
and
hurried
over
to
the
great
fireplace
this
is
a
huge
affair
and
has
a
queer
i
think
they
are
called
projecting
from
the
back
of
the
arch
i
sealed
the
opening
with
seven
human
hairs
the
seventh
crossing
the
six
others
then
just
as
i
was
making
an
end
a
low
mocking
whistle
grew
in
the
room
a
cold
nervous
pricking
went
up
my
spine
and
my
forehead
from
the
back
the
hideous
sound
filled
all
the
room
with
an
extraordinary
grotesque
parody
of
human
whistling
too
gigantic
to
be
human
as
if
something
gargantuan
and
monstrous
made
the
sounds
softly
as
i
stood
there
a
last
moment
pressing
down
the
final
seal
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
i
had
come
across
one
of
those
rare
and
horrible
cases
of
the
reproducing
the
functions
of
the
i
made
a
grab
for
my
lamp
and
went
quickly
to
the
door
looking
over
my
shoulder
and
listening
for
the
thing
that
i
expected
it
came
just
as
i
got
my
hand
upon
the
handle
a
squeal
of
incredible
malevolent
anger
piercing
through
the
low
hooning
of
the
whistling
i
dashed
out
slamming
the
door
and
locking
it
i
leant
a
little
against
the
opposite
wall
of
the
corridor
feeling
rather
funny
for
it
had
been
a
narrow
squeak
be
noe
sayfetie
to
be
gained
bye
gayrds
of
holieness
when
the
monyster
hath
to
speak
throe
woode
and
stoene
so
runs
the
passage
in
the
sigsand
and
i
proved
it
in
that
business
there
is
no
protection
against
this
particular
form
of
monster
except
possibly
for
a
fractional
period
of
time
for
it
can
reproduce
itself
in
or
take
to
its
purpose
the
very
protective
material
which
you
may
use
and
has
the
power
to
wythine
the
pentycle
though
not
immediately
there
is
of
course
the
possibility
of
the
unknown
last
line
of
the
saaamaaa
ritual
being
uttered
but
it
is
too
uncertain
to
count
upon
and
the
danger
is
too
hideous
and
even
then
it
has
no
power
to
protect
for
more
than
fyve
beats
of
the
harte
as
the
sigsand
has
it
inside
of
the
room
there
was
now
a
constant
meditative
hooning
whistling
but
presently
this
ceased
and
the
silence
seemed
worse
for
there
is
such
a
sense
of
hidden
mischief
in
a
silence
after
a
little
i
sealed
the
door
with
crossed
hairs
and
then
cleared
off
down
the
great
passage
and
so
to
bed
for
a
long
time
i
lay
awake
but
managed
eventually
to
get
some
sleep
yet
about
two
i
was
waked
by
the
hooning
whistling
of
the
room
coming
to
me
even
through
the
closed
doors
the
sound
was
tremendous
and
seemed
to
beat
through
the
whole
house
with
a
presiding
sense
of
terror
as
if
i
remember
thinking
some
monstrous
giant
had
been
holding
mad
carnival
with
itself
at
the
end
of
that
great
passage
i
got
up
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
wondering
whether
to
go
along
and
have
a
look
at
the
seal
and
suddenly
there
came
a
thump
on
my
door
and
tassoc
walked
in
with
his
dressing
gown
over
his
pajamas
thought
it
would
have
waked
you
so
i
came
along
to
have
a
talk
he
said
ca
sleep
beautiful
is
it
i
said
and
tossed
him
my
case
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
we
sat
and
talked
for
about
an
hour
and
all
the
time
that
noise
went
on
down
at
the
end
of
the
big
corridor
suddenly
tassoc
stood
up
take
our
guns
and
go
and
examine
the
brute
he
said
and
turned
toward
the
door
i
said
jove
i
ca
say
anything
definite
yet
but
i
believe
that
room
is
about
as
dangerous
as
it
well
can
be
haunted
he
asked
keenly
and
without
any
of
his
frequent
banter
i
told
him
of
course
that
i
could
not
say
a
definite
or
to
such
a
question
but
that
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
make
a
statement
soon
then
i
gave
him
a
little
lecture
on
the
false
of
the
through
the
he
began
then
to
see
the
particular
way
in
the
room
might
be
dangerous
if
it
were
really
the
subject
of
a
manifestation
about
an
hour
later
the
whistling
ceased
quite
suddenly
and
tassoc
went
off
again
to
bed
i
went
back
to
mine
also
and
eventually
got
another
spell
of
sleep
in
the
morning
i
went
along
to
the
room
i
found
the
seals
on
the
door
intact
then
i
went
in
the
window
seals
and
the
hair
were
all
right
but
the
seventh
hair
across
the
great
fireplace
was
broken
this
set
me
thinking
i
knew
that
it
might
very
possibly
have
snapped
through
my
having
tensioned
it
too
highly
but
then
again
it
might
have
been
broken
by
something
else
yet
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
a
man
for
instance
could
have
passed
between
the
six
unbroken
hairs
for
no
one
would
ever
have
noticed
them
entering
the
room
that
way
you
see
but
just
walked
through
them
ignorant
of
their
very
existence
i
removed
the
other
hairs
and
the
seals
then
i
looked
up
the
chimney
it
went
up
straight
and
i
could
see
blue
sky
at
the
top
it
was
a
big
open
flue
and
free
from
any
suggestion
of
hiding
places
or
corners
yet
of
course
i
did
not
trust
to
any
such
casual
examination
and
after
breakfast
i
put
on
my
overalls
and
climbed
to
the
very
top
sounding
all
the
way
but
i
found
nothing
then
i
came
down
and
went
over
the
whole
of
the
room
floor
ceiling
and
walls
mapping
them
out
in
squares
and
sounding
with
both
hammer
and
probe
but
there
was
nothing
abnormal
afterward
i
made
a
search
of
the
whole
castle
in
the
same
thorough
way
but
found
nothing
i
went
even
further
then
for
at
night
when
the
whistling
commenced
i
made
a
microphone
test
you
see
if
the
whistling
were
mechanically
produced
this
test
would
have
made
evident
to
me
the
working
of
the
machinery
if
there
were
any
such
concealed
within
the
walls
it
certainly
was
an
method
of
examination
as
you
must
allow
of
course
i
did
not
think
that
any
of
tassoc
rivals
had
fixed
up
any
mechanical
contrivance
but
i
thought
it
just
possible
that
there
had
been
some
such
thing
for
producing
the
whistling
made
away
back
in
the
years
perhaps
with
the
intention
of
giving
the
room
a
reputation
that
would
ensure
its
being
free
of
inquisitive
folk
you
see
what
i
mean
well
of
course
it
was
just
possible
if
this
were
the
case
that
someone
knew
the
secret
of
the
machinery
and
was
utilizing
the
knowledge
to
play
this
devil
of
a
prank
on
tassoc
the
microphone
test
of
the
walls
would
certainly
have
made
this
known
to
me
as
i
have
said
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
in
the
castle
so
that
i
had
practically
no
doubt
at
all
now
but
that
it
was
a
genuine
case
of
what
is
popularly
termed
all
this
time
every
night
and
sometimes
most
of
each
night
the
hooning
whistling
of
the
room
was
intolerable
it
was
as
if
an
intelligence
there
knew
that
steps
were
being
taken
against
it
and
piped
and
hooned
in
a
sort
of
mad
mocking
contempt
i
tell
you
it
was
as
extraordinary
as
it
was
horrible
time
after
time
i
went
along
tiptoeing
noiselessly
on
stockinged
feet
to
the
sealed
door
for
i
always
kept
the
room
sealed
i
went
at
all
hours
of
the
night
and
often
the
whistling
inside
would
seem
to
change
to
a
brutally
malignant
note
as
though
the
monster
saw
me
plainly
through
the
shut
door
and
all
the
time
the
shrieking
hooning
whistling
would
fill
the
whole
corridor
so
that
i
used
to
feel
a
precious
lonely
chap
messing
about
there
with
one
of
hell
mysteries
and
every
morning
i
would
enter
the
room
and
examine
the
different
hairs
and
seals
you
see
after
the
first
week
i
had
stretched
parallel
hairs
all
along
the
walls
of
the
room
and
along
the
ceiling
but
over
the
floor
which
was
of
polished
stone
i
had
set
out
little
colorless
wafers
uppermost
each
wafer
was
numbered
and
they
were
arranged
after
a
definite
plan
so
that
i
should
be
able
to
trace
the
exact
movements
of
any
living
thing
that
went
across
the
floor
you
will
see
that
no
material
being
or
creature
could
possibly
have
entered
that
room
without
leaving
many
signs
to
tell
me
about
it
but
nothing
was
ever
disturbed
and
i
began
to
think
that
i
should
have
to
risk
an
attempt
to
stay
the
night
in
the
room
in
the
electric
pentacle
yet
mind
you
i
knew
that
it
would
be
a
crazy
thing
to
do
but
i
was
getting
stumped
and
ready
to
do
anything
once
about
midnight
i
did
break
the
seal
on
the
door
and
have
a
quick
look
in
but
i
tell
you
the
whole
room
gave
one
mad
yell
and
seemed
to
come
toward
me
in
a
great
belly
of
shadows
as
if
the
walls
had
bellied
in
toward
me
of
course
that
must
have
been
fancy
anyway
the
yell
was
sufficient
and
i
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
feeling
a
bit
weak
down
my
spine
you
know
the
feeling
and
then
when
i
had
got
to
that
state
of
readiness
for
anything
i
made
something
of
a
discovery
it
was
about
one
in
the
morning
and
i
was
walking
slowly
the
castle
keeping
in
the
soft
grass
i
had
come
under
the
shadow
of
the
east
front
and
far
above
me
i
could
hear
the
vile
hooning
whistle
of
the
room
up
in
the
darkness
of
the
unlit
wing
then
suddenly
a
little
in
front
of
me
i
heard
a
man
voice
speaking
low
but
evidently
in
glee
george
you
chaps
but
i
would
care
to
bring
a
wife
home
in
that
it
said
in
the
tone
of
the
cultured
irish
someone
started
to
reply
but
there
came
a
sharp
exclamation
and
then
a
rush
and
i
heard
footsteps
running
in
all
directions
evidently
the
men
had
spotted
me
for
a
few
seconds
i
stood
there
feeling
an
awful
ass
after
all
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
haunting
do
you
see
what
a
big
fool
it
made
me
seem
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
they
were
some
of
tassoc
rivals
and
here
i
had
been
feeling
in
every
bone
that
i
had
hit
a
real
bad
genuine
case
and
then
you
know
there
came
the
memory
of
hundreds
of
details
that
made
me
just
as
much
in
doubt
again
anyway
whether
it
was
natural
or
there
was
a
great
deal
yet
to
be
cleared
up
i
told
tassoc
next
morning
what
i
had
discovered
and
through
the
whole
of
every
night
for
five
nights
we
kept
a
close
watch
the
east
wing
but
there
was
never
a
sign
of
anyone
prowling
about
and
all
the
time
almost
from
evening
to
dawn
that
grotesque
whistling
would
hoon
incredibly
far
above
us
in
the
darkness
on
the
morning
after
the
fifth
night
i
received
a
wire
from
here
which
brought
me
home
by
the
next
boat
i
explained
to
tassoc
that
i
was
simply
bound
to
come
away
for
a
few
days
but
told
him
to
keep
up
the
watch
the
castle
one
thing
i
was
very
careful
to
do
and
that
was
to
make
him
absolutely
promise
never
to
go
into
the
room
between
sunset
and
sunrise
i
made
it
clear
to
him
that
we
knew
nothing
definite
yet
one
way
or
the
other
and
if
the
room
were
what
i
had
first
thought
it
to
be
it
might
be
a
lot
better
for
him
to
die
first
than
enter
it
after
dark
when
i
got
here
and
had
finished
my
business
i
thought
you
chaps
would
be
interested
and
also
i
wanted
to
get
it
all
spread
out
clear
in
my
mind
so
i
rung
you
up
i
am
going
over
again
and
when
i
get
back
i
ought
to
have
something
pretty
extraordinary
to
tell
you
by
the
way
there
is
a
curious
thing
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
tried
to
get
a
phonographic
record
of
the
whistling
but
it
simply
produced
no
impression
on
the
wax
at
all
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
has
made
me
feel
queer
i
can
tell
you
another
extraordinary
thing
is
that
the
microphone
will
not
magnify
the
sound
will
not
even
transmit
it
seems
to
take
no
account
of
it
and
acts
as
if
it
were
nonexistent
i
am
absolutely
and
utterly
stumped
up
to
the
present
i
am
a
wee
bit
curious
to
see
whether
any
of
your
dear
clever
heads
can
make
daylight
of
it
can
not
not
yet
he
rose
to
his
feet
good
night
all
he
said
and
began
to
usher
us
out
abruptly
but
without
offence
into
the
night
a
fortnight
later
he
dropped
each
of
us
a
card
and
you
can
imagine
that
i
was
not
late
this
time
when
we
arrived
carnacki
took
us
straight
into
dinner
and
when
we
had
finished
and
all
made
ourselves
comfortable
he
began
again
where
he
had
left
off
now
just
listen
quietly
for
i
have
got
something
pretty
queer
to
tell
you
i
got
back
late
at
night
and
i
had
to
walk
up
to
the
castle
as
i
had
not
warned
them
that
i
was
coming
it
was
bright
moonlight
so
that
the
walk
was
rather
a
pleasure
than
otherwise
when
i
got
there
the
whole
place
was
in
darkness
and
i
thought
i
would
take
a
walk
outside
to
see
whether
tassoc
or
his
brother
was
keeping
watch
but
i
could
not
find
them
anywhere
and
concluded
that
they
had
got
tired
of
it
and
gone
off
to
bed
as
i
returned
across
the
front
of
the
east
wing
i
caught
the
hooning
whistling
of
the
room
coming
down
strangely
through
the
stillness
of
the
night
it
had
a
queer
note
in
it
i
remember
low
and
constant
queerly
meditative
i
looked
up
at
the
window
bright
in
the
moonlight
and
got
a
sudden
thought
to
bring
a
ladder
from
the
stable
yard
and
try
to
get
a
look
into
the
room
through
the
window
with
this
notion
i
hunted
at
the
back
of
the
castle
among
the
straggle
of
offices
and
presently
found
a
long
fairly
light
ladder
though
it
was
heavy
enough
for
one
goodness
knows
and
i
thought
at
first
that
i
should
never
get
it
reared
i
managed
at
last
and
let
the
ends
rest
very
quietly
against
the
wall
a
little
below
the
sill
of
the
larger
window
then
going
silently
i
went
up
the
ladder
presently
i
had
my
face
above
the
sill
and
was
looking
in
alone
with
the
moonlight
of
course
the
queer
whistling
sounded
louder
up
there
but
it
still
conveyed
that
peculiar
sense
of
something
whistling
quietly
to
itself
can
you
understand
though
for
all
the
meditative
lowness
of
the
note
the
horrible
gargantuan
quality
was
distinct
a
mighty
parody
of
the
human
as
if
i
stood
there
and
listened
to
the
whistling
from
the
lips
of
a
monster
with
a
man
soul
and
then
you
know
i
saw
something
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
huge
empty
room
was
puckered
upward
in
the
center
into
a
strange
mound
parted
at
the
top
into
an
ever
changing
hole
that
pulsated
to
that
great
gentle
hooning
at
times
as
i
watched
i
saw
the
heaving
of
the
indented
mound
gap
across
with
a
queer
inward
suction
as
with
the
drawing
of
an
enormous
breath
then
the
thing
would
dilate
and
pout
once
more
to
the
incredible
melody
and
suddenly
as
i
stared
dumb
it
came
to
me
that
the
thing
was
living
i
was
looking
at
two
enormous
blackened
lips
blistered
and
brutal
there
in
the
pale
moonlight
abruptly
they
bulged
out
to
a
vast
pouting
mound
of
force
and
sound
stiffened
and
swollen
and
hugely
massive
and
in
the
and
a
great
sweat
lay
heavy
on
the
vast
in
the
same
moment
of
time
the
whistling
had
burst
into
a
mad
screaming
note
that
seemed
to
stun
me
even
where
i
stood
outside
of
the
window
and
then
the
following
moment
i
was
staring
blankly
at
the
solid
undisturbed
floor
of
the
room
smooth
polished
stone
flooring
from
wall
to
wall
and
there
was
an
absolute
silence
you
can
picture
me
staring
into
the
quiet
room
and
knowing
what
i
knew
i
felt
like
a
sick
frightened
kid
and
wanted
to
slide
down
the
ladder
and
run
away
but
in
that
very
instant
i
heard
voice
calling
to
me
from
within
the
room
for
help
my
god
but
i
got
such
an
awful
dazed
feeling
and
i
had
a
vague
bewildered
notion
that
after
all
it
was
the
irishmen
who
had
got
him
in
there
and
were
taking
it
out
of
him
and
then
the
call
came
again
and
i
burst
the
window
and
jumped
in
to
help
him
i
had
a
confused
idea
that
the
call
had
come
from
within
the
shadow
of
the
great
fireplace
and
i
raced
across
to
it
but
there
was
no
one
there
i
shouted
and
my
voice
went
the
great
apartment
and
then
in
a
flash
knew
that
tassoc
had
never
i
whirled
sick
with
fear
toward
the
window
and
as
i
did
so
a
frightful
exultant
whistling
scream
burst
through
the
room
on
my
left
the
end
wall
had
toward
me
in
a
pair
of
gargantuan
lips
black
and
utterly
monstrous
to
within
a
yard
of
my
face
i
fumbled
for
a
mad
instant
at
my
revolver
not
for
but
myself
for
the
danger
was
a
thousand
times
worse
than
death
and
then
suddenly
the
unknown
last
line
of
the
saaamaaa
ritual
was
whispered
quite
audibly
in
the
room
instantly
the
thing
happened
that
i
have
known
once
before
there
came
a
sense
as
of
dust
falling
continually
and
monotonously
and
i
knew
that
my
life
hung
uncertain
and
suspended
for
a
flash
in
a
brief
reeling
vertigo
of
unseeable
things
then
ended
and
i
knew
that
i
might
live
my
soul
and
body
blended
again
and
life
and
power
came
to
me
i
dashed
furiously
at
the
window
and
hurled
myself
out
for
i
can
tell
you
that
i
had
stopped
being
afraid
of
death
i
crashed
down
on
to
the
ladder
and
slithered
grabbing
and
grabbing
and
so
came
some
way
or
other
alive
to
the
bottom
and
there
i
sat
in
the
soft
wet
grass
with
the
moonlight
all
about
me
and
far
above
through
the
broken
window
of
the
room
there
was
a
low
whistling
that
is
the
chief
of
it
i
was
not
hurt
and
i
went
to
the
front
and
knocked
tassoc
up
when
they
let
me
in
we
had
a
long
yarn
over
some
good
whisky
for
i
was
shaken
to
pieces
and
i
explained
things
as
much
as
i
could
i
told
tassoc
that
the
room
would
have
to
come
down
and
every
fragment
of
it
burned
in
a
erected
within
a
pentacle
he
nodded
there
was
nothing
to
say
then
i
went
to
bed
we
turned
a
small
army
on
to
the
work
and
within
ten
days
that
lovely
thing
had
gone
up
in
smoke
and
what
was
left
was
calcined
and
clean
it
was
when
the
workmen
were
stripping
the
paneling
that
i
got
hold
of
a
sound
notion
of
the
beginnings
of
that
beastly
development
over
the
great
fireplace
after
the
great
oak
panels
had
been
torn
down
i
found
that
there
was
let
into
the
masonry
a
scrollwork
of
stone
with
on
it
an
old
inscription
in
ancient
celtic
that
here
in
this
room
was
burned
dian
tiansay
jester
of
king
alzof
who
made
the
song
of
foolishness
upon
king
ernore
of
the
seventh
castle
when
i
got
the
translation
clear
i
gave
it
to
tassoc
he
was
tremendously
excited
for
he
knew
the
old
tale
and
took
me
down
to
the
library
to
look
at
an
old
parchment
that
gave
the
story
in
detail
afterward
i
found
that
the
incident
was
about
the
countryside
but
always
regarded
more
as
a
legend
than
as
history
and
no
one
seemed
ever
to
have
dreamt
that
the
old
east
wing
of
iastrae
castle
was
the
remains
of
the
ancient
seventh
castle
from
the
old
parchment
i
gathered
that
there
had
been
a
pretty
dirty
job
done
away
back
in
the
years
it
seems
that
king
alzof
and
king
ernore
had
been
enemies
by
birthright
as
you
might
say
truly
but
that
nothing
more
than
a
little
raiding
had
occurred
on
either
side
for
years
until
dian
tiansay
made
the
song
of
foolishness
upon
king
ernore
and
sang
it
before
king
alzof
and
so
greatly
was
it
appreciated
that
king
alzof
gave
the
jester
one
of
his
ladies
to
wife
presently
all
the
people
of
the
land
had
come
to
know
the
song
and
so
it
came
at
last
to
king
ernore
who
was
so
angered
that
he
made
war
upon
his
old
enemy
and
took
and
burned
him
and
his
castle
but
dian
tiansay
the
jester
he
brought
with
him
to
his
own
place
and
having
torn
his
tongue
out
because
of
the
song
which
he
had
made
and
sung
he
imprisoned
him
in
the
room
in
the
east
wing
which
was
evidently
used
for
unpleasant
purposes
and
the
jester
wife
he
kept
for
himself
having
a
fancy
for
her
prettiness
but
one
night
dian
tiansay
wife
was
not
to
be
found
and
in
the
morning
they
discovered
her
lying
dead
in
her
husband
arms
and
he
sitting
whistling
the
song
of
foolishness
for
he
had
no
longer
the
power
to
sing
it
then
they
roasted
dian
tiansay
in
the
great
fireplace
probably
from
that
selfsame
which
i
have
already
mentioned
and
until
he
died
dian
tiansay
ceased
not
to
whistle
the
song
of
foolishness
which
he
could
no
longer
sing
but
afterward
that
room
there
was
often
heard
at
night
the
sound
of
something
whistling
and
there
a
power
in
that
room
so
that
none
dared
to
sleep
in
it
and
presently
it
would
seem
the
king
went
to
another
castle
for
the
whistling
troubled
him
there
you
have
it
all
of
course
that
is
only
a
rough
rendering
of
the
translation
of
the
parchment
but
it
sounds
extraordinarily
quaint
you
think
so
yes
i
said
answering
for
the
lot
but
how
did
the
thing
grow
to
such
a
tremendous
manifestation
one
of
those
cases
of
continuity
of
thought
producing
a
positive
action
upon
the
immediate
surrounding
material
replied
carnacki
the
development
must
have
been
going
forward
through
centuries
to
have
produced
such
a
monstrosity
it
was
a
true
instance
of
saiitii
manifestation
which
i
can
best
explain
by
likening
it
to
a
living
spiritual
fungus
which
involves
the
very
structure
of
the
itself
and
of
course
in
so
doing
acquires
an
essential
control
over
the
substance
involved
in
it
it
is
impossible
to
make
it
plainer
in
a
few
words
what
broke
the
seventh
hair
asked
taylor
but
carnacki
did
not
know
he
thought
it
was
probably
nothing
but
being
too
severely
tensioned
he
also
explained
that
they
found
out
that
the
men
who
had
run
away
had
not
been
up
to
mischief
but
had
come
over
secretly
merely
to
hear
the
whistling
which
indeed
had
suddenly
become
the
talk
of
the
whole
countryside
one
other
thing
said
arkright
have
you
any
idea
what
governs
the
use
of
the
unknown
last
line
of
the
saaamaaa
ritual
i
know
of
course
that
it
was
used
by
the
priests
in
the
incantation
of
raaaee
but
what
used
it
on
your
behalf
and
what
made
it
you
had
better
read
harzan
monograph
and
my
addenda
to
it
on
astral
and
astral
and
interference
said
carnacki
it
is
an
extraordinary
subject
and
i
can
only
say
here
that
the
human
vibration
may
not
be
insulated
from
the
astral
as
is
always
believed
to
be
the
case
in
interferences
by
the
without
immediate
action
being
taken
by
those
forces
which
govern
the
spinning
of
the
outer
circle
in
other
words
it
is
being
proved
time
after
time
that
there
is
some
inscrutable
protective
force
constantly
intervening
between
the
human
soul
not
the
body
mind
you
and
the
outer
monstrosities
am
i
clear
yes
i
think
so
i
replied
and
you
believe
that
the
room
had
become
the
material
expression
of
the
ancient
jester
that
his
soul
rotten
with
hatred
had
bred
into
a
monster
eh
i
asked
yes
said
carnacki
nodding
i
think
you
put
my
thought
rather
neatly
it
is
a
queer
coincidence
that
miss
donnehue
is
supposed
to
be
descended
so
i
have
heard
since
from
the
same
king
ernore
it
makes
one
think
some
curious
thoughts
does
it
the
marriage
coming
on
and
the
room
waking
to
fresh
life
if
she
had
gone
into
that
room
ever
eh
had
waited
a
long
time
sins
of
the
fathers
yes
i
thought
of
that
they
to
be
married
next
week
and
i
am
to
be
best
man
which
is
a
thing
i
hate
and
he
won
his
bets
rather
just
think
ever
she
had
gone
into
that
room
pretty
horrible
eh
he
nodded
his
head
grimly
and
we
four
nodded
back
then
he
rose
and
took
us
collectively
to
the
door
and
presently
thrust
us
forth
in
friendly
fashion
on
the
embankment
and
into
the
fresh
night
air
good
night
we
all
called
back
and
went
to
our
various
homes
if
she
had
eh
if
she
had
that
is
what
i
kept
thinking
no
the
horse
of
the
invisible
i
had
that
afternoon
received
an
invitation
from
carnacki
when
i
reached
his
place
i
found
him
sitting
alone
as
i
came
into
the
room
he
rose
with
a
perceptibly
stiff
movement
and
extended
his
left
hand
his
face
seemed
to
be
badly
scarred
and
bruised
and
his
right
hand
was
bandaged
he
shook
hands
and
offered
me
his
paper
which
i
refused
then
he
passed
me
a
handful
of
photographs
and
returned
to
his
reading
now
that
is
just
carnacki
not
a
word
had
come
from
him
and
not
a
question
from
me
he
would
tell
us
all
about
it
later
i
spent
about
half
an
hour
looking
at
the
photographs
which
were
chiefly
snaps
some
by
flashlight
of
an
extraordinarily
pretty
girl
though
in
some
of
the
photographs
it
was
wonderful
that
her
prettiness
was
so
evident
for
so
frightened
and
startled
was
her
expression
that
it
was
difficult
not
to
believe
that
she
had
been
photographed
in
the
presence
of
some
imminent
and
overwhelming
danger
the
bulk
of
the
photographs
were
of
interiors
of
different
rooms
and
passages
and
in
every
one
the
girl
might
be
seen
either
full
length
in
the
distance
or
closer
with
perhaps
little
more
than
a
hand
or
arm
or
portion
of
the
head
or
dress
included
in
the
photograph
all
of
these
had
evidently
been
taken
with
some
definite
aim
that
did
not
have
for
its
first
purpose
the
picturing
of
the
girl
but
obviously
of
her
surroundings
and
they
made
me
very
curious
as
you
can
imagine
near
the
bottom
of
the
pile
however
i
came
upon
something
extraordinary
it
was
a
photograph
of
the
girl
standing
abrupt
and
clear
in
the
great
blaze
of
a
flashlight
as
was
plain
to
be
seen
her
face
was
turned
a
little
upward
as
if
she
had
been
frightened
suddenly
by
some
noise
directly
above
her
as
though
and
coming
down
out
of
the
shadows
was
the
shape
of
a
single
enormous
hoof
i
examined
this
photograph
for
a
long
time
without
understanding
it
more
than
that
it
had
probably
to
do
with
some
queer
case
in
which
carnacki
was
interested
when
jessop
arkright
and
taylor
came
in
carnacki
quietly
held
out
his
hand
for
the
photographs
which
i
returned
in
the
same
spirit
and
afterward
we
all
went
in
to
dinner
when
we
had
spent
a
quiet
hour
at
the
table
we
pulled
our
chairs
and
made
ourselves
snug
and
carnacki
began
i
been
north
he
said
speaking
slowly
and
painfully
between
puffs
at
his
pipe
up
to
hisgins
of
east
lancashire
it
has
been
a
pretty
strange
business
all
as
i
fancy
you
chaps
will
think
when
i
have
finished
i
knew
before
i
went
something
about
the
story
as
i
have
heard
it
called
but
i
never
thought
of
it
coming
my
way
somehow
also
i
know
that
i
never
considered
it
seriously
in
spite
of
my
rule
always
to
keep
an
open
mind
funny
creatures
we
humans
well
i
got
a
wire
asking
for
an
appointment
which
of
course
told
me
that
there
was
some
trouble
on
the
date
i
fixed
old
captain
hisgins
himself
came
up
to
see
me
he
told
me
a
great
many
new
details
about
the
horse
story
though
naturally
i
had
always
known
the
main
points
and
understood
that
if
the
first
child
were
a
girl
that
girl
would
be
haunted
by
the
horse
during
her
courtship
it
is
as
you
can
see
already
an
extraordinary
story
and
though
i
have
always
known
about
it
i
have
never
thought
it
to
be
anything
more
than
an
legend
as
i
have
already
hinted
you
see
for
seven
generations
the
hisgins
family
have
had
men
children
for
their
and
even
the
hisginses
themselves
have
long
considered
the
tale
to
be
little
more
than
a
myth
to
come
to
the
present
the
eldest
child
of
the
reigning
family
is
a
girl
and
she
has
been
often
teased
and
warned
in
jest
by
her
friends
and
relations
that
she
is
the
first
girl
to
be
the
eldest
for
seven
generations
and
that
she
would
have
to
keep
her
men
friends
at
arm
length
or
go
into
a
nunnery
if
she
hoped
to
escape
the
haunting
and
this
i
think
shows
us
how
thoroughly
the
tale
had
grown
to
be
considered
as
nothing
worthy
of
the
least
serious
thought
do
you
think
so
two
months
ago
miss
hisgins
became
engaged
to
beaumont
a
young
naval
officer
and
on
the
evening
of
the
very
day
of
the
engagement
before
it
was
even
formally
announced
a
most
extraordinary
thing
happened
which
resulted
in
captain
hisgins
making
the
appointment
and
my
ultimately
going
down
to
their
place
to
look
into
the
thing
from
the
old
family
records
and
papers
that
were
entrusted
to
me
i
found
that
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
that
prior
to
something
like
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
there
were
some
very
extraordinary
and
disagreeable
coincidences
to
put
the
thing
in
the
least
emotional
way
in
the
whole
of
the
two
centuries
prior
to
that
date
there
were
five
girls
out
of
a
total
of
seven
generations
of
the
family
each
of
these
girls
grew
up
to
maidenhood
and
each
became
engaged
and
each
one
died
during
the
period
of
engagement
two
by
suicide
one
by
falling
from
a
window
one
from
a
heart
presumably
heart
failure
owing
to
sudden
shock
through
fright
the
fifth
girl
was
killed
one
evening
in
the
park
the
house
but
just
how
there
seemed
to
be
no
knowledge
only
that
there
was
an
impression
that
she
had
been
kicked
by
a
horse
she
was
dead
when
found
now
you
see
all
of
these
deaths
might
be
attributed
in
a
way
even
the
suicides
to
natural
causes
i
mean
as
distinct
from
supernatural
you
see
yet
in
every
case
the
maidens
had
undoubtedly
suffered
some
extraordinary
and
terrifying
experiences
during
their
various
courtships
for
in
all
of
the
records
there
was
mention
either
of
the
neighing
of
an
unseen
horse
or
of
the
sounds
of
an
invisible
horse
galloping
as
well
as
many
other
peculiar
and
quite
inexplicable
manifestations
you
begin
to
understand
now
i
think
just
how
extraordinary
a
business
it
was
that
i
was
asked
to
look
into
i
gathered
from
one
account
that
the
haunting
of
the
girls
was
so
constant
and
horrible
that
two
of
the
girls
lovers
fairly
ran
away
from
their
ladyloves
and
i
think
it
was
this
more
than
anything
else
that
made
me
feel
that
there
had
been
something
more
in
it
than
a
mere
succession
of
uncomfortable
coincidences
i
got
hold
of
these
facts
before
i
had
been
many
hours
in
the
house
and
after
this
i
went
pretty
carefully
into
the
details
of
the
thing
that
happened
on
the
night
of
miss
hisgins
engagement
to
beaumont
it
seems
that
as
the
two
of
them
were
going
through
the
big
lower
corridor
just
after
dusk
and
before
the
lamps
had
been
lighted
there
had
been
a
sudden
horrible
neighing
in
the
corridor
close
to
them
immediately
afterward
beaumont
received
a
tremendous
blow
or
kick
which
broke
his
right
forearm
then
the
rest
of
the
family
and
the
servants
came
running
to
know
what
was
wrong
lights
were
brought
and
the
corridor
and
afterward
the
whole
house
searched
but
nothing
unusual
was
found
you
can
imagine
the
excitement
in
the
house
and
the
half
incredulous
half
believing
talk
about
the
old
legend
then
later
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
old
captain
was
waked
by
the
sound
of
a
great
horse
galloping
and
the
house
several
times
after
this
both
beaumont
and
the
girl
said
that
they
had
heard
the
sounds
of
hoofs
near
to
them
after
dusk
in
several
of
the
rooms
and
corridors
three
nights
later
beaumont
was
waked
by
a
strange
neighing
in
the
nighttime
seeming
to
come
from
the
direction
of
his
sweetheart
bedroom
he
ran
hurriedly
for
her
father
and
the
two
of
them
raced
to
her
room
they
found
her
awake
and
ill
with
sheer
terror
having
been
awakened
by
the
neighing
seemingly
close
to
her
bed
the
night
before
i
arrived
there
had
been
a
fresh
happening
and
they
were
all
in
a
frightfully
nervy
state
as
you
can
imagine
i
spent
most
of
the
first
day
as
i
have
hinted
in
getting
hold
of
details
but
after
dinner
i
slacked
off
and
played
billiards
all
the
evening
with
beaumont
and
miss
hisgins
we
stopped
about
ten
and
had
coffee
and
i
got
beaumont
to
give
me
full
particulars
about
the
thing
that
had
happened
the
evening
before
he
and
miss
hisgins
had
been
sitting
quietly
in
her
aunt
boudoir
whilst
the
old
lady
chaperoned
them
behind
a
book
it
was
growing
dusk
and
the
lamp
was
at
her
end
of
the
table
the
rest
of
the
house
was
not
yet
lit
as
the
evening
had
come
earlier
than
usual
well
it
seems
that
the
door
into
the
hall
was
open
and
suddenly
the
girl
said
what
that
they
both
listened
and
then
beaumont
heard
it
the
sound
of
a
horse
outside
of
the
front
door
father
he
suggested
but
she
reminded
him
that
her
father
was
not
riding
of
course
they
were
both
ready
to
feel
queer
as
you
can
suppose
but
beaumont
made
an
effort
to
shake
this
off
and
went
into
the
hall
to
see
whether
anyone
was
at
the
entrance
it
was
pretty
dark
in
the
hall
and
he
could
see
the
glass
panels
of
the
inner
draft
door
in
the
darkness
of
the
hall
he
walked
over
to
the
glass
and
looked
through
into
the
drive
beyond
but
there
nothing
in
sight
he
felt
nervous
and
puzzled
and
opened
the
inner
door
and
went
out
on
to
the
almost
directly
afterward
the
great
hall
door
swung
to
with
a
crash
behind
him
he
told
me
that
he
had
a
sudden
awful
feeling
of
having
been
trapped
in
some
way
that
is
how
he
put
it
he
whirled
and
gripped
the
door
handle
but
something
seemed
to
be
holding
it
with
a
vast
grip
on
the
other
side
then
before
he
could
be
fixed
in
his
mind
that
this
was
so
he
was
able
to
turn
the
handle
and
open
the
door
he
paused
a
moment
in
the
doorway
and
peered
into
the
hall
for
he
had
hardly
steadied
his
mind
sufficiently
to
know
whether
he
was
really
frightened
or
not
then
he
heard
his
sweetheart
blow
him
a
kiss
out
of
the
greyness
of
the
big
unlit
hall
and
he
knew
that
she
had
followed
him
from
the
boudoir
he
blew
her
a
kiss
back
and
stepped
inside
the
doorway
meaning
to
go
to
her
and
then
suddenly
in
a
flash
of
sickening
knowledge
he
knew
that
it
was
not
his
sweetheart
who
had
blown
him
that
kiss
he
knew
that
something
was
trying
to
tempt
him
alone
into
the
darkness
and
that
the
girl
had
never
left
the
boudoir
he
jumped
back
and
in
the
same
instant
of
time
he
heard
the
kiss
again
nearer
to
him
he
called
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
stay
in
the
boudoir
move
out
of
the
boudoir
until
i
come
to
you
he
heard
her
call
something
in
reply
from
the
boudoir
and
then
he
had
struck
a
clump
of
a
dozen
or
so
matches
and
was
holding
them
above
his
head
and
looking
the
hall
there
was
no
one
in
it
but
even
as
the
matches
burned
out
there
came
the
sounds
of
a
great
horse
galloping
down
the
empty
drive
now
you
see
both
he
and
the
girl
had
heard
the
sounds
of
the
horse
galloping
but
when
i
questioned
more
closely
i
found
that
the
aunt
had
heard
nothing
though
it
is
true
she
is
a
bit
deaf
and
she
was
further
back
in
the
room
of
course
both
he
and
miss
hisgins
had
been
in
an
extremely
nervous
state
and
ready
to
hear
anything
the
door
might
have
been
slammed
by
a
sudden
puff
of
wind
owing
to
some
inner
door
being
opened
and
as
for
the
grip
on
the
handle
that
may
have
been
nothing
more
than
the
snick
catching
with
regard
to
the
kisses
and
the
sounds
of
the
horse
galloping
i
pointed
out
that
these
might
have
seemed
ordinary
enough
sounds
if
they
had
been
only
cool
enough
to
reason
as
i
told
him
and
as
he
knew
the
sounds
of
a
horse
galloping
carry
a
long
way
on
the
wind
so
that
what
he
had
heard
might
have
been
nothing
more
than
a
horse
being
ridden
some
distance
away
and
as
for
the
kiss
plenty
of
quiet
noises
the
rustle
of
a
paper
or
a
leaf
have
a
somewhat
similar
sound
especially
if
one
is
in
an
overstrung
condition
and
imagining
things
i
finished
preaching
this
little
sermon
on
commonsense
versus
hysteria
as
we
put
out
the
lights
and
left
the
billiard
room
but
neither
beaumont
nor
miss
hisgins
would
agree
that
there
had
been
any
fancy
on
their
parts
we
had
come
out
of
the
billiard
room
by
this
time
and
were
going
along
the
passage
and
i
was
still
doing
my
best
to
make
both
of
them
see
the
ordinary
commonplace
possibilities
of
the
happening
when
what
killed
my
pig
as
the
saying
goes
was
the
sound
of
a
hoof
in
the
dark
billiard
room
we
had
just
left
i
felt
the
come
on
me
in
a
flash
up
my
spine
and
over
the
back
of
my
head
miss
hisgins
whooped
like
a
child
with
the
whooping
cough
and
ran
up
the
passage
giving
little
gasping
screams
beaumont
however
ripped
on
his
heels
and
jumped
back
a
couple
of
yards
i
gave
back
too
a
bit
as
you
can
understand
it
is
he
said
in
a
low
breathless
voice
believe
now
certainly
something
i
whispered
never
taking
my
gaze
off
the
closed
door
of
the
billiard
room
he
muttered
it
is
again
there
was
a
sound
like
a
great
horse
pacing
and
the
billiard
room
with
slow
deliberate
steps
a
horrible
cold
fright
took
me
so
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
take
a
full
breath
you
know
the
feeling
and
then
i
saw
we
must
have
been
walking
backward
for
we
found
ourselves
suddenly
at
the
opening
of
the
long
passage
we
stopped
there
and
listened
the
sounds
went
on
steadily
with
a
horrible
sort
of
deliberateness
as
if
the
brute
were
taking
a
sort
of
malicious
gusto
in
walking
about
all
over
the
room
which
we
had
just
occupied
do
you
understand
just
what
i
mean
then
there
was
a
pause
and
a
long
time
of
absolute
quiet
except
for
an
excited
whispering
from
some
of
the
people
down
in
the
big
hall
the
sound
came
plainly
up
the
wide
stairway
i
fancy
they
were
gathered
miss
hisgins
with
some
notion
of
protecting
her
i
should
think
beaumont
and
i
stood
there
at
the
end
of
the
passage
for
about
five
minutes
listening
for
any
noise
in
the
billiard
room
then
i
realized
what
a
horrible
funk
i
was
in
and
i
said
to
him
going
to
see
what
there
i
he
answered
he
was
pretty
white
but
he
had
heaps
of
pluck
i
told
him
to
wait
one
instant
and
i
made
a
dash
into
my
bedroom
and
got
my
camera
and
flashlight
i
slipped
my
revolver
into
my
pocket
and
a
over
my
left
fist
where
it
was
ready
and
yet
would
not
stop
me
from
being
able
to
work
my
flashlight
then
i
ran
back
to
beaumont
he
held
out
his
hand
to
show
me
that
he
had
his
pistol
and
i
nodded
but
whispered
to
him
not
to
be
too
quick
to
shoot
as
there
might
be
some
silly
practical
joking
at
work
after
all
he
had
got
a
lamp
from
a
bracket
in
the
upper
hall
which
he
was
holding
in
the
crook
of
his
damaged
arm
so
that
we
had
a
good
light
then
we
went
down
the
passage
toward
the
billiard
room
and
you
can
imagine
that
we
were
a
pretty
nervous
couple
all
this
time
there
had
not
been
a
sound
but
abruptly
when
we
were
within
perhaps
a
couple
of
yards
of
the
door
we
heard
the
sudden
clumping
of
a
hoof
on
the
solid
floor
of
the
billiard
room
in
the
instant
afterward
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
whole
place
shook
beneath
the
ponderous
hoof
falls
of
some
huge
thing
toward
the
both
beaumont
and
i
gave
back
a
pace
or
two
and
then
realized
and
hung
on
to
our
courage
as
you
might
say
and
waited
the
great
tread
came
right
up
to
the
door
and
then
stopped
and
there
was
an
instant
of
absolute
silence
except
that
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
pulsing
in
my
throat
and
temples
almost
deafened
me
i
dare
say
we
waited
quite
half
a
minute
and
then
came
the
further
restless
clumping
of
a
great
hoof
immediately
afterward
the
sounds
came
right
on
as
if
some
invisible
thing
passed
through
the
closed
door
and
the
ponderous
tread
was
upon
us
we
jumped
each
of
us
to
our
side
of
the
passage
and
i
know
that
i
spread
myself
stiff
against
the
wall
the
clungk
clunck
clungk
clunck
of
the
great
hoof
falls
passed
right
between
us
and
slowly
and
with
deadly
deliberateness
down
the
passage
i
heard
them
through
a
haze
of
blood
beats
in
my
ears
and
temples
and
my
body
was
extraordinarily
rigid
and
pringling
and
i
was
horribly
breathless
i
stood
for
a
little
time
like
this
my
head
turned
so
that
i
could
see
up
the
passage
i
was
conscious
only
that
there
was
a
hideous
danger
abroad
do
you
understand
and
then
suddenly
my
pluck
came
back
to
me
i
was
aware
that
the
noise
of
the
hoof
beats
sounded
near
the
other
end
of
the
passage
i
twisted
quickly
and
got
my
camera
to
bear
and
snapped
off
the
flashlight
immediately
afterward
beaumont
let
fly
a
storm
of
shots
down
the
passage
and
began
to
run
shouting
after
mary
run
run
he
rushed
down
the
passage
and
i
after
him
we
came
out
on
the
main
landing
and
heard
the
sound
of
a
hoof
on
the
stairs
and
after
that
nothing
and
from
thence
onward
nothing
down
below
us
in
the
big
hall
i
could
see
a
number
of
the
household
miss
hisgins
who
seemed
to
have
fainted
and
there
were
several
of
the
servants
clumped
together
a
little
way
off
staring
up
at
the
main
landing
and
no
one
saying
a
single
word
and
about
some
twenty
steps
up
the
stairs
was
the
old
captain
hisgins
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
where
he
had
halted
just
below
the
last
hoof
sound
i
think
i
never
saw
anything
finer
than
the
old
man
standing
there
between
his
daughter
and
that
infernal
thing
i
daresay
you
can
understand
the
queer
feeling
of
horror
i
had
at
passing
that
place
on
the
stairs
where
the
sounds
had
ceased
it
was
as
if
the
monster
were
still
standing
there
invisible
and
the
peculiar
thing
was
that
we
never
heard
another
sound
of
the
hoof
either
up
or
down
the
stairs
after
they
had
taken
miss
hisgins
to
her
room
i
sent
word
that
i
should
follow
so
soon
as
they
were
ready
for
me
and
presently
when
a
message
came
to
tell
me
that
i
could
come
any
time
i
asked
her
father
to
give
me
a
hand
with
my
instrument
box
and
between
us
we
carried
it
into
the
girl
bedroom
i
had
the
bed
pulled
well
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
after
which
i
erected
the
electric
pentacle
the
bed
then
i
directed
that
lamps
should
be
placed
the
room
but
that
on
no
account
must
any
light
be
made
within
the
pentacle
neither
must
anyone
pass
in
or
out
the
girl
mother
i
had
placed
within
the
pentacle
and
directed
that
her
maid
should
sit
without
ready
to
carry
any
message
so
as
to
make
sure
that
hisgins
did
not
have
to
leave
the
pentacle
i
suggested
also
that
the
girl
father
should
stay
the
night
in
the
room
and
that
he
had
better
be
armed
when
i
left
the
bedroom
i
found
beaumont
waiting
outside
the
door
in
a
miserable
state
of
anxiety
i
told
him
what
i
had
done
and
explained
to
him
that
miss
hisgins
was
probably
perfectly
safe
within
the
but
that
in
addition
to
her
father
remaining
the
night
in
the
room
i
intended
to
stand
guard
at
the
door
i
told
him
that
i
should
like
him
to
keep
me
company
for
i
knew
that
he
could
never
sleep
feeling
as
he
did
and
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
have
a
companion
also
i
wanted
to
have
him
under
my
own
observation
for
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
actually
in
greater
danger
in
some
ways
than
the
girl
at
least
that
was
my
opinion
and
is
still
as
i
think
you
will
agree
later
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
object
to
my
drawing
a
pentacle
him
for
the
night
and
got
him
to
agree
but
i
saw
that
he
did
not
know
whether
to
be
superstitious
about
it
or
to
regard
it
more
as
a
piece
of
foolish
mumming
but
he
took
it
seriously
enough
when
i
gave
him
some
particulars
about
the
black
veil
case
when
young
aster
died
you
remember
he
said
it
was
a
piece
of
silly
superstition
and
stayed
outside
poor
devil
the
night
passed
quietly
enough
until
a
little
while
before
dawn
when
we
both
heard
the
sounds
of
a
great
horse
galloping
and
the
house
just
as
old
captain
hisgins
had
described
it
you
can
imagine
how
queer
it
made
me
feel
and
directly
afterward
i
heard
someone
stir
within
the
bedroom
i
knocked
at
the
door
for
i
was
uneasy
and
the
captain
came
i
asked
whether
everything
was
right
to
which
he
replied
yes
and
immediately
asked
me
whether
i
had
heard
the
galloping
so
that
i
knew
he
had
heard
them
also
i
suggested
that
it
might
be
well
to
leave
the
bedroom
door
open
a
little
until
the
dawn
came
in
as
there
was
certainly
something
abroad
this
was
done
and
he
went
back
into
the
room
to
be
near
his
wife
and
daughter
i
had
better
say
here
that
i
was
doubtful
whether
there
was
any
value
in
the
about
miss
hisgins
for
what
i
term
the
of
the
manifestation
were
so
extraordinarily
material
that
i
was
inclined
to
parallel
the
case
with
that
one
of
harford
where
the
hand
of
the
child
kept
materializing
within
the
pentacle
and
patting
the
floor
as
you
will
remember
that
was
a
hideous
business
yet
as
it
chanced
nothing
further
happened
and
so
soon
as
daylight
had
fully
come
we
all
went
off
to
bed
beaumont
knocked
me
up
about
midday
and
i
went
down
and
made
breakfast
into
lunch
miss
hisgins
was
there
and
seemed
in
very
fair
spirits
considering
she
told
me
that
i
had
made
her
feel
almost
safe
for
the
first
time
for
days
she
told
me
also
that
her
cousin
harry
parsket
was
coming
down
from
london
and
she
knew
that
he
would
do
anything
to
help
fight
the
ghost
and
after
that
she
and
beaumont
went
out
into
the
grounds
to
have
a
little
time
together
i
had
a
walk
in
the
grounds
myself
and
went
the
house
but
saw
no
traces
of
hoof
marks
and
after
that
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
making
an
examination
of
the
house
but
found
nothing
i
made
an
end
of
my
search
before
dark
and
went
to
my
room
to
dress
for
dinner
when
i
got
down
the
cousin
had
just
arrived
and
i
found
him
one
of
the
nicest
men
i
have
met
for
a
long
time
a
chap
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
pluck
and
the
particular
kind
of
man
i
like
to
have
with
me
in
a
bad
case
like
the
one
i
was
on
i
could
see
that
what
puzzled
him
most
was
our
belief
in
the
genuineness
of
the
haunting
and
i
found
myself
almost
wanting
something
to
happen
just
to
show
him
how
true
it
was
as
it
chanced
something
did
happen
with
a
vengeance
beaumont
and
miss
hisgins
had
gone
out
for
a
stroll
just
before
the
dusk
and
captain
hisgins
asked
me
to
come
into
his
study
for
a
short
chat
whilst
parsket
went
upstairs
with
his
traps
for
he
had
no
man
with
him
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
the
old
captain
in
which
i
pointed
out
that
the
had
evidently
no
particular
connection
with
the
house
but
only
with
the
girl
herself
and
that
the
sooner
she
was
married
the
better
as
it
would
give
beaumont
a
right
to
be
with
her
at
all
times
and
further
than
this
it
might
be
that
the
manifestations
would
cease
if
the
marriage
were
actually
performed
the
old
man
nodded
agreement
to
this
especially
to
the
first
part
and
reminded
me
that
three
of
the
girls
who
were
said
to
have
been
had
been
sent
away
from
home
and
met
their
deaths
whilst
away
and
then
in
the
midst
of
our
talk
there
came
a
pretty
frightening
interruption
for
all
at
once
the
old
butler
rushed
into
the
room
most
extraordinarily
pale
mary
sir
miss
mary
sir
he
gasped
screaming
out
in
the
park
sir
and
they
say
they
can
hear
the
horse
the
captain
made
one
dive
for
a
rack
of
arms
and
snatched
down
his
old
sword
and
ran
out
drawing
it
as
he
ran
i
dashed
out
and
up
the
stairs
snatched
my
and
a
heavy
revolver
gave
one
yell
at
parsket
door
horse
and
was
down
and
into
the
grounds
away
in
the
darkness
there
was
a
confused
shouting
and
i
caught
the
sounds
of
shooting
out
among
the
scattered
trees
and
then
from
a
patch
of
blackness
to
my
left
there
burst
suddenly
an
infernal
gobbling
sort
of
neighing
instantly
i
whipped
and
snapped
off
the
flashlight
the
great
light
blazed
out
momentarily
showing
me
the
leaves
of
a
big
tree
close
at
hand
quivering
in
the
night
breeze
but
i
saw
nothing
else
and
then
the
blackness
came
down
upon
me
and
i
heard
parsket
shouting
a
little
way
back
to
know
whether
i
had
seen
anything
the
next
instant
he
was
beside
me
and
i
felt
safer
for
his
company
for
there
was
some
incredible
thing
near
to
us
and
i
was
momentarily
blind
because
of
the
brightness
of
the
flashlight
was
it
what
was
it
he
kept
repeating
in
an
excited
voice
and
all
the
time
i
was
staring
into
the
darkness
and
answering
mechanically
do
know
i
do
know
there
was
a
burst
of
shouting
somewhere
ahead
and
then
a
shot
we
ran
toward
the
sounds
yelling
to
the
people
not
to
shoot
for
in
the
darkness
and
panic
there
was
this
danger
also
then
there
came
two
of
the
racing
hard
up
the
drive
with
their
lanterns
and
guns
and
immediately
afterward
a
row
of
lights
dancing
toward
us
from
the
house
carried
by
some
of
the
as
the
lights
came
up
i
saw
we
had
come
close
to
beaumont
he
was
standing
over
miss
hisgins
and
he
had
his
revolver
in
his
hand
then
i
saw
his
face
and
there
was
a
great
wound
across
his
forehead
by
him
was
the
captain
turning
his
naked
sword
this
way
and
that
and
peering
into
the
darkness
a
little
behind
him
stood
the
old
butler
a
from
one
of
the
arm
stands
in
the
hall
in
his
hands
yet
there
was
nothing
strange
to
be
seen
anywhere
we
got
the
girl
into
the
house
and
left
her
with
her
mother
and
beaumont
whilst
a
groom
rode
for
a
doctor
and
then
the
rest
of
us
with
four
other
keepers
all
armed
with
guns
and
carrying
lanterns
searched
the
home
park
but
we
found
nothing
when
we
got
back
we
found
that
the
doctor
had
been
he
had
bound
up
beaumont
wound
which
luckily
was
not
deep
and
ordered
miss
hisgins
straight
to
bed
i
went
upstairs
with
the
captain
and
found
beaumont
on
guard
outside
of
the
girl
door
i
asked
him
how
he
felt
and
then
so
soon
as
the
girl
and
her
mother
were
ready
for
us
captain
hisgins
and
i
went
into
the
bedroom
and
fixed
the
pentacle
again
the
bed
they
had
already
got
lamps
about
the
room
and
after
i
had
set
the
same
order
of
watching
as
on
the
previous
night
i
joined
beaumont
outside
of
the
door
parsket
had
come
up
while
i
had
been
in
the
bedroom
and
between
us
we
got
some
idea
from
beaumont
as
to
what
had
happened
out
in
the
park
it
seems
that
they
were
coming
home
after
their
stroll
from
the
direction
of
the
west
lodge
it
had
got
quite
dark
and
suddenly
miss
hisgins
said
and
came
to
a
standstill
he
stopped
and
listened
but
heard
nothing
for
a
little
then
he
caught
it
the
sound
of
a
horse
seemingly
a
long
way
off
galloping
toward
them
over
the
grass
he
told
the
girl
that
it
was
nothing
and
started
to
hurry
her
toward
the
house
but
she
was
not
deceived
of
course
in
less
than
a
minute
they
heard
it
quite
close
to
them
in
the
darkness
and
they
started
running
then
miss
hisgins
caught
her
foot
and
fell
she
began
to
scream
and
that
is
what
the
butler
heard
as
beaumont
lifted
the
girl
he
heard
the
hoofs
come
thudding
right
at
him
he
stood
over
her
and
fired
all
five
chambers
of
his
revolver
right
at
the
sounds
he
told
us
that
he
was
sure
he
saw
something
that
looked
like
an
enormous
horse
head
right
upon
him
in
the
light
of
the
last
flash
of
his
pistol
immediately
afterward
he
was
struck
a
tremendous
blow
which
knocked
him
down
and
then
the
captain
and
the
butler
came
running
up
shouting
the
rest
of
course
we
knew
about
ten
the
butler
brought
us
up
a
tray
for
which
i
was
very
glad
as
the
night
before
i
had
got
rather
hungry
i
warned
beaumont
however
to
be
very
particular
not
to
drink
any
spirits
and
i
also
made
him
give
me
his
pipe
and
matches
at
midnight
i
drew
a
pentacle
him
and
parsket
and
i
sat
one
on
each
side
of
him
outside
the
pentacle
for
i
had
no
fear
that
there
would
be
any
manifestation
made
against
anyone
except
beaumont
or
miss
hisgins
after
that
we
kept
pretty
quiet
the
passage
was
lit
by
a
big
lamp
at
each
end
so
that
we
had
plenty
of
light
and
we
were
all
armed
beaumont
and
i
with
revolvers
and
parsket
with
a
shotgun
in
addition
to
my
weapon
i
had
my
camera
and
flashlight
now
and
again
we
talked
in
whispers
and
twice
the
captain
came
out
of
the
bedroom
to
have
a
word
with
us
about
one
we
had
all
grown
very
silent
and
suddenly
about
twenty
minutes
later
i
held
up
my
hand
silently
for
there
seemed
to
be
a
sound
of
galloping
out
in
the
night
i
knocked
on
the
bedroom
door
for
the
captain
to
open
it
and
when
he
came
i
whispered
to
him
that
we
thought
we
heard
the
horse
for
some
time
we
stayed
listening
and
both
parsket
and
the
captain
thought
they
heard
it
but
now
i
was
not
so
sure
neither
was
beaumont
yet
afterward
i
thought
i
heard
it
again
i
told
captain
hisgins
i
thought
he
had
better
go
into
the
bedroom
and
leave
the
door
a
little
open
and
this
he
did
but
from
that
time
onward
we
heard
nothing
and
presently
the
dawn
came
in
and
we
all
went
very
thankfully
to
bed
when
i
was
called
at
lunchtime
i
had
a
little
surprise
for
captain
hisgins
told
me
that
they
had
held
a
family
council
and
had
decided
to
take
my
advice
and
have
the
marriage
without
a
day
more
delay
than
possible
beaumont
was
already
on
his
way
to
london
to
get
a
special
license
and
they
hoped
to
have
the
wedding
next
day
this
pleased
me
for
it
seemed
the
sanest
thing
to
be
done
in
the
extraordinary
circumstances
and
meanwhile
i
should
continue
my
investigations
but
until
the
marriage
was
accomplished
my
chief
thought
was
to
keep
miss
hisgins
near
to
me
after
lunch
i
thought
i
would
take
a
few
experimental
photographs
of
miss
hisgins
and
her
sometimes
the
camera
sees
things
that
would
seem
very
strange
to
normal
human
eyesight
with
this
intention
and
partly
to
make
an
excuse
to
keep
her
in
my
company
as
much
as
possible
i
asked
miss
hisgins
to
join
me
in
my
experiments
she
seemed
glad
to
do
this
and
i
spent
several
hours
with
her
wandering
all
over
the
house
from
room
to
room
and
whenever
the
impulse
came
i
took
a
flashlight
of
her
and
the
room
or
corridor
in
which
we
chanced
to
be
at
the
moment
after
we
had
gone
right
through
the
house
in
this
fashion
i
asked
her
whether
she
felt
sufficiently
brave
to
repeat
the
experiments
in
the
cellars
she
said
yes
and
so
i
rooted
out
captain
hisgins
and
parsket
for
i
was
not
going
to
take
her
even
into
what
you
might
call
artificial
darkness
without
help
and
companionship
at
hand
when
we
were
ready
we
went
down
into
the
wine
cellar
captain
hisgins
carrying
a
shotgun
and
parsket
a
specially
prepared
background
and
a
lantern
i
got
the
girl
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
cellar
whilst
parsket
and
the
captain
held
out
the
background
behind
her
then
i
fired
off
the
flashlight
and
we
went
into
the
next
cellar
where
we
repeated
the
experiment
then
in
the
third
cellar
a
tremendous
place
something
extraordinary
and
horrible
manifested
itself
i
had
stationed
miss
hisgins
in
the
center
of
the
place
with
her
father
and
parsket
holding
the
background
as
before
when
all
was
ready
and
just
as
i
pressed
the
trigger
of
the
there
came
in
the
cellar
that
dreadful
gobbling
neighing
that
i
had
heard
out
in
the
park
it
seemed
to
come
from
somewhere
above
the
girl
and
in
the
glare
of
the
sudden
light
i
saw
that
she
was
staring
tensely
upward
but
at
no
visible
thing
and
then
in
the
succeeding
comparative
darkness
i
was
shouting
to
the
captain
and
parsket
to
run
miss
hisgins
out
into
the
daylight
this
was
done
instantly
and
i
shut
and
locked
the
door
afterward
making
the
first
and
eighth
signs
of
the
saaamaaa
ritual
opposite
to
each
post
and
connecting
them
across
the
threshold
with
a
triple
line
in
the
meanwhile
parsket
and
captain
hisgins
carried
the
girl
to
her
mother
and
left
her
there
in
a
half
fainting
condition
whilst
i
stayed
on
guard
outside
of
the
cellar
door
feeling
pretty
horrible
for
i
knew
that
there
was
some
disgusting
thing
inside
and
along
with
this
feeling
there
was
a
sense
of
half
ashamedness
rather
miserable
you
know
because
i
had
exposed
miss
hisgins
to
the
danger
i
had
got
the
captain
shotgun
and
when
he
and
parsket
came
down
again
they
were
each
carrying
guns
and
lanterns
i
could
not
possibly
tell
you
the
utter
relief
of
spirit
and
body
that
came
to
me
when
i
heard
them
coming
but
just
try
to
imagine
what
it
was
like
standing
outside
of
that
cellar
can
you
i
remember
noticing
just
before
i
went
to
unlock
the
door
how
white
and
ghastly
parsket
looked
and
the
old
captain
was
and
i
wondered
whether
my
face
was
like
theirs
and
this
you
know
had
its
own
distinct
effect
upon
my
nerves
for
it
seemed
to
bring
the
beastliness
of
the
thing
crashing
down
on
to
me
in
a
fresh
way
i
know
it
was
only
sheer
will
power
that
carried
me
up
to
the
door
and
made
me
turn
the
key
i
paused
one
little
moment
and
then
with
a
nervy
jerk
sent
the
door
wide
open
and
held
my
lantern
over
my
head
parsket
and
the
captain
came
one
on
each
side
of
me
and
held
up
their
lanterns
but
the
place
was
absolutely
empty
of
course
i
did
not
trust
to
a
casual
look
of
this
kind
but
spent
several
hours
with
the
help
of
the
two
others
in
sounding
every
square
foot
of
the
floor
ceiling
and
walls
yet
in
the
end
i
had
to
admit
that
the
place
itself
was
absolutely
normal
and
so
we
came
away
but
i
sealed
the
door
and
outside
opposite
each
doorpost
i
made
the
first
and
last
signs
of
the
saaamaaa
ritual
joined
them
as
before
with
a
triple
line
can
you
imagine
what
it
was
like
searching
that
cellar
when
we
got
upstairs
i
inquired
very
anxiously
how
miss
hisgins
was
and
the
girl
came
out
herself
to
tell
me
that
she
was
all
right
and
that
i
was
not
to
trouble
about
her
or
blame
myself
as
i
told
her
i
had
been
doing
i
felt
happier
then
and
went
off
to
dress
for
dinner
and
after
that
was
done
parsket
and
i
took
one
of
the
bathrooms
to
develop
the
negatives
that
i
had
been
taking
yet
none
of
the
plates
had
anything
to
tell
us
until
we
came
to
the
one
that
was
taken
in
the
cellar
parsket
was
developing
and
i
had
taken
a
batch
of
the
fixed
plates
out
into
the
lamplight
to
examine
them
i
had
just
gone
carefully
through
the
lot
when
i
heard
a
shout
from
parsket
and
when
i
ran
to
him
he
was
looking
at
a
negative
which
he
was
holding
up
to
the
red
lamp
it
showed
the
girl
plainly
looking
upward
as
i
had
seen
her
but
the
thing
that
astonished
me
was
the
shadow
of
an
enormous
hoof
right
above
her
as
if
it
were
coming
down
upon
her
out
of
the
shadows
and
you
know
i
had
run
her
bang
into
that
danger
that
was
the
thought
that
was
chief
in
my
mind
as
soon
as
the
developing
was
complete
i
fixed
the
plate
and
examined
it
carefully
in
a
good
light
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
at
all
the
thing
above
miss
hisgins
was
an
enormous
shadowy
hoof
yet
i
was
no
nearer
to
coming
to
any
definite
knowledge
and
the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
to
warn
parsket
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
the
girl
for
it
would
only
increase
her
fright
but
i
showed
the
thing
to
her
father
for
i
considered
it
right
that
he
should
know
that
night
we
took
the
same
precaution
for
miss
hisgins
safety
as
on
the
two
previous
nights
and
parsket
kept
me
company
yet
the
dawn
came
in
without
anything
unusual
having
happened
and
i
went
off
to
bed
when
i
got
down
to
lunch
i
learnt
that
beaumont
had
wired
to
say
that
he
would
be
in
soon
after
four
also
that
a
message
had
been
sent
to
the
rector
and
it
was
generally
plain
that
the
ladies
of
the
house
were
in
a
tremendous
fluster
beaumont
train
was
late
and
he
did
not
get
home
until
five
but
even
then
the
rector
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
and
the
butler
came
in
to
say
that
the
coachman
had
returned
without
him
as
he
had
been
called
away
unexpectedly
twice
more
during
the
evening
the
carriage
was
sent
down
but
the
clergyman
had
not
returned
and
we
had
to
delay
the
marriage
until
the
next
day
that
night
i
arranged
the
the
girl
bed
and
the
captain
and
his
wife
sat
up
with
her
as
before
beaumont
as
i
expected
insisted
on
keeping
watch
with
me
and
he
seemed
in
a
curiously
frightened
mood
not
for
himself
you
know
but
for
miss
hisgins
he
had
a
horrible
feeling
he
told
me
that
there
would
be
a
final
dreadful
attempt
on
his
sweetheart
that
night
this
of
course
i
told
him
was
nothing
but
nerves
yet
really
it
made
me
feel
very
anxious
for
i
have
seen
too
much
not
to
know
that
under
such
circumstances
a
premonitory
of
impending
danger
is
not
necessarily
to
be
put
down
entirely
to
nerves
in
fact
beaumont
was
so
simply
and
earnestly
convinced
that
the
night
would
bring
some
extraordinary
manifestation
that
i
got
parsket
to
rig
up
a
long
cord
from
the
wire
of
the
butler
bell
to
come
along
the
passage
handy
to
the
butler
himself
i
gave
directions
not
to
undress
and
to
give
the
same
order
to
two
of
the
footmen
if
i
rang
he
was
to
come
instantly
with
the
footmen
carrying
lanterns
and
the
lanterns
were
to
be
kept
ready
lit
all
night
if
for
any
reason
the
bell
did
not
ring
and
i
blew
my
whistle
he
was
to
take
that
as
a
signal
in
the
place
of
the
bell
after
i
had
arranged
all
these
minor
details
i
drew
a
pentacle
about
beaumont
and
warned
him
very
particularly
to
stay
within
it
whatever
happened
and
when
this
was
done
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
and
pray
that
the
night
would
go
as
quietly
as
the
night
before
we
scarcely
talked
at
all
and
by
about
one
we
were
all
very
tense
and
nervous
so
that
at
last
parsket
got
up
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
corridor
to
steady
himself
a
bit
presently
i
slipped
off
my
pumps
and
joined
him
and
we
walked
up
and
down
whispering
occasionally
for
something
over
an
hour
until
in
turning
i
caught
my
foot
in
the
bell
cord
and
went
down
on
my
face
but
without
hurting
myself
or
making
a
noise
when
i
got
up
parsket
nudged
me
you
notice
that
the
bell
never
rang
he
whispered
i
said
right
a
minute
he
answered
bet
it
only
a
kink
somewhere
in
the
cord
he
left
his
gun
and
slipped
along
the
passage
and
taking
the
top
lamp
tiptoed
away
into
the
house
carrying
beaumont
revolver
ready
in
his
right
hand
he
was
a
plucky
chap
i
remember
thinking
then
and
again
later
just
then
beaumont
motioned
to
me
for
absolute
quiet
directly
afterward
i
heard
the
thing
for
which
he
listened
the
sound
of
a
horse
galloping
out
in
the
night
i
think
that
i
may
say
i
fairly
shivered
the
sound
died
away
and
left
a
horrible
desolate
eerie
feeling
in
the
air
you
know
i
put
my
hand
out
to
the
bell
cord
hoping
parsket
had
got
it
clear
then
i
waited
glancing
before
and
behind
perhaps
two
minutes
passed
full
of
what
seemed
like
an
almost
unearthly
quiet
and
then
suddenly
down
the
corridor
at
the
lighted
end
there
sounded
the
clumping
of
a
great
hoof
and
instantly
the
lamp
was
thrown
with
a
tremendous
crash
and
we
were
in
the
dark
i
tugged
hard
on
the
cord
and
blew
the
whistle
then
i
raised
my
snapshot
and
fired
the
flashlight
the
corridor
blazed
into
brilliant
light
but
there
was
nothing
and
then
the
darkness
fell
like
thunder
i
heard
the
captain
at
the
bedroom
door
and
shouted
to
him
to
bring
out
a
lamp
but
instead
something
started
to
kick
the
door
and
i
heard
the
captain
shouting
within
the
bedroom
and
then
the
screaming
of
the
women
i
had
a
sudden
horrible
fear
that
the
monster
had
got
into
the
bedroom
but
in
the
same
instant
from
up
the
corridor
there
came
abruptly
the
vile
gobbling
neighing
that
we
had
heard
in
the
park
and
the
cellar
i
blew
the
whistle
again
and
groped
blindly
for
the
bell
cord
shouting
to
beaumont
to
stay
in
the
pentacle
whatever
happened
i
yelled
again
to
the
captain
to
bring
out
a
lamp
and
there
came
a
smashing
sound
against
the
bedroom
door
then
i
had
my
matches
in
my
hand
to
get
some
light
before
that
incredible
unseen
monster
was
upon
us
the
match
scraped
on
the
box
and
flared
up
dully
and
in
the
same
instant
i
heard
a
faint
sound
behind
me
i
whipped
in
a
kind
of
mad
terror
and
saw
something
in
the
light
of
the
match
a
monstrous
close
to
beaumont
out
beaumont
i
shouted
in
a
sort
of
scream
behind
you
the
match
went
out
abruptly
and
instantly
there
came
the
huge
bang
of
parsket
both
barrels
at
once
fired
evidently
by
beaumont
close
to
my
ear
as
it
seemed
i
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
great
head
in
the
flash
and
of
an
enormous
hoof
amid
the
belch
of
fire
and
smoke
seeming
to
be
descending
upon
beaumont
in
the
same
instant
i
fired
three
chambers
of
my
revolver
there
was
the
sound
of
a
dull
blow
and
then
that
horrible
gobbling
neigh
broke
out
close
to
me
i
fired
twice
at
the
sound
immediately
afterward
something
struck
me
and
i
was
knocked
backward
i
got
on
to
my
knees
and
shouted
for
help
at
the
top
of
my
voice
i
heard
the
women
screaming
behind
the
closed
door
of
the
bedroom
and
was
dully
aware
that
the
door
was
being
smashed
from
the
inside
and
directly
afterward
i
knew
that
beaumont
was
struggling
with
some
hideous
thing
near
to
me
for
an
instant
i
held
back
stupidly
paralyzed
with
funk
and
then
blindly
and
in
a
sort
of
rigid
chill
of
goose
flesh
i
went
to
help
him
shouting
his
name
i
can
tell
you
i
was
nearly
sick
with
the
naked
fear
i
had
on
me
there
came
a
little
choking
scream
out
of
the
darkness
and
at
that
i
jumped
forward
into
the
dark
i
gripped
a
vast
furry
ear
then
something
struck
me
another
great
blow
knocking
me
sick
i
hit
back
weak
and
blind
and
gripped
with
my
other
hand
at
the
incredible
thing
abruptly
i
was
dimly
aware
of
a
tremendous
crash
behind
me
and
a
great
burst
of
light
there
were
other
lights
in
the
passage
and
a
noise
of
feet
and
shouting
my
were
torn
from
the
thing
they
held
i
shut
my
eyes
stupidly
and
heard
a
loud
yell
above
me
and
then
a
heavy
blow
like
a
butcher
chopping
meat
and
then
something
fell
upon
me
i
was
helped
to
my
knees
by
the
captain
and
the
butler
on
the
floor
lay
an
enormous
out
of
which
protruded
a
man
trunk
and
legs
on
the
wrists
were
fixed
great
hoofs
it
was
the
monster
the
captain
cut
something
with
the
sword
that
he
held
in
his
hand
and
stooped
and
lifted
off
the
mask
for
that
is
what
it
was
i
saw
the
face
then
of
the
man
who
had
worn
it
it
was
parsket
he
had
a
bad
wound
across
the
forehead
where
the
captain
sword
had
bit
through
the
mask
i
looked
bewilderedly
from
him
to
beaumont
who
was
sitting
up
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
corridor
then
i
stared
at
parsket
again
jove
i
said
at
last
and
then
i
was
quiet
for
i
was
so
ashamed
for
the
man
you
can
understand
ca
you
and
he
was
opening
his
eyes
and
you
know
i
had
grown
so
to
like
him
and
then
you
know
just
as
parsket
was
getting
back
his
wits
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
and
beginning
to
remember
there
happened
a
strange
and
incredible
thing
for
from
the
end
of
the
corridor
there
sounded
suddenly
the
clumping
of
a
great
hoof
i
looked
that
way
and
then
instantly
at
parsket
and
saw
a
horrible
fear
in
his
face
and
eyes
he
wrenched
himself
weakly
and
stared
in
mad
terror
up
the
corridor
to
where
the
sound
had
been
and
the
rest
of
us
stared
in
a
frozen
group
i
remember
vaguely
half
sobs
and
whispers
from
miss
hisgins
bedroom
all
the
while
that
i
stared
frightenedly
up
the
corridor
the
silence
lasted
several
seconds
and
then
abruptly
there
came
again
the
clumping
of
the
great
hoof
away
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
immediately
afterward
the
clungk
clunk
clungk
clunk
of
mighty
hoofs
coming
down
the
passage
toward
us
even
then
you
know
most
of
us
thought
it
was
some
mechanism
of
parsket
still
at
work
and
we
were
in
the
queerest
mixture
of
fright
and
doubt
i
think
everyone
looked
at
parsket
and
suddenly
the
captain
shouted
out
this
damned
fooling
at
once
have
you
done
enough
for
my
part
i
was
now
frightened
for
i
had
a
that
there
was
something
horrible
and
wrong
and
then
parsket
managed
to
gasp
out
not
me
my
god
it
not
me
my
god
it
not
me
and
then
you
know
it
seemed
to
come
home
to
everyone
in
an
instant
that
there
was
really
some
dreadful
thing
coming
down
the
passage
there
was
a
mad
rush
to
get
away
and
even
old
captain
hisgins
gave
back
with
the
butler
and
the
footmen
beaumont
fainted
outright
as
i
found
afterward
for
he
had
been
badly
mauled
i
just
flattened
back
against
the
wall
kneeling
as
i
was
too
stupid
and
dazed
even
to
run
and
almost
in
the
same
instant
the
ponderous
hoof
falls
sounded
close
to
me
and
seeming
to
shake
the
solid
floor
as
they
passed
abruptly
the
great
sounds
ceased
and
i
knew
in
a
sort
of
sick
fashion
that
the
thing
had
halted
opposite
to
the
door
of
the
girl
bedroom
and
then
i
was
aware
that
parsket
was
standing
rocking
in
the
doorway
with
his
arms
spread
across
so
as
to
fill
the
doorway
with
his
body
parsket
was
extraordinarily
pale
and
the
blood
was
running
down
his
face
from
the
wound
in
his
forehead
and
then
i
noticed
that
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
something
in
the
passage
with
a
peculiar
desperate
fixed
incredibly
masterful
gaze
but
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
seen
and
suddenly
the
clungk
clunk
clungk
clunk
recommenced
and
passed
onward
down
the
passage
in
the
same
moment
parsket
pitched
forward
out
of
the
doorway
on
to
his
face
there
were
shouts
from
the
huddle
of
men
down
the
passage
and
the
two
footmen
and
the
butler
simply
ran
carrying
their
lanterns
but
the
captain
went
against
the
with
his
back
and
put
the
lamp
he
was
carrying
over
his
head
the
dull
tread
of
the
horse
went
past
him
and
left
him
unharmed
and
i
heard
the
monstrous
hoof
falls
going
away
and
away
through
the
quiet
house
and
after
that
a
dead
silence
then
the
captain
moved
and
came
toward
us
very
slow
and
shaky
and
with
an
extraordinarily
grey
face
i
crept
toward
parsket
and
the
captain
came
to
help
me
we
turned
him
over
and
you
know
i
knew
in
a
moment
that
he
was
dead
but
you
can
imagine
what
a
feeling
it
sent
through
me
i
looked
at
the
captain
and
suddenly
he
said
that
that
and
i
know
that
he
was
trying
to
tell
me
that
parsket
had
stood
between
his
daughter
and
whatever
it
was
that
had
gone
down
the
passage
i
stood
up
and
steadied
him
though
i
was
not
very
steady
myself
and
suddenly
his
face
began
to
work
and
he
went
down
on
to
his
knees
by
parsket
and
cried
like
some
shaken
child
then
the
women
came
out
of
the
doorway
of
the
bedroom
and
i
turned
away
and
left
him
to
them
whilst
i
over
to
beaumont
that
is
practically
the
whole
story
and
the
only
thing
that
is
left
to
me
is
to
try
to
explain
some
of
the
puzzling
parts
here
and
there
perhaps
you
have
seen
that
parsket
was
in
love
with
miss
hisgins
and
this
fact
is
the
key
to
a
good
deal
that
was
extraordinary
he
was
doubtless
responsible
for
some
portions
of
the
in
fact
i
think
for
nearly
everything
but
you
know
i
can
prove
nothing
and
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
chiefly
the
result
of
deduction
in
the
first
place
it
is
obvious
that
parsket
intention
was
to
frighten
beaumont
away
and
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
do
this
i
think
he
grew
so
desperate
that
he
really
intended
to
kill
him
i
hate
to
say
this
but
the
facts
force
me
to
think
so
i
am
quite
certain
that
it
was
parsket
who
broke
beaumont
arm
he
knew
all
the
details
of
the
legend
and
got
the
idea
to
work
upon
the
old
story
for
his
own
end
he
evidently
had
some
method
of
slipping
in
and
out
of
the
house
probably
through
one
of
the
many
french
windows
or
possibly
he
had
a
key
to
one
or
two
of
the
garden
doors
and
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
away
he
was
really
coming
down
on
the
quiet
and
hiding
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
the
incident
of
the
kiss
in
the
dark
hall
i
put
down
to
sheer
nervous
imaginings
on
the
part
of
beaumont
and
miss
hisgins
yet
i
must
say
that
the
sound
of
the
horse
outside
of
the
front
door
is
a
little
difficult
to
explain
away
but
i
am
still
inclined
to
keep
to
my
first
idea
on
this
point
that
there
was
nothing
really
unnatural
about
it
the
hoof
sounds
in
the
billiard
room
and
down
the
passage
were
done
by
parsket
from
the
floor
below
by
bumping
up
against
the
paneled
ceiling
with
a
block
of
wood
tied
to
one
of
the
window
hooks
i
proved
this
by
an
examination
which
showed
the
dents
in
the
woodwork
the
sounds
of
the
horse
galloping
the
house
were
possibly
made
also
by
parsket
who
must
have
had
a
horse
tied
up
in
the
plantation
nearby
unless
indeed
he
made
the
sounds
himself
but
i
do
not
see
how
he
could
have
gone
fast
enough
to
produce
the
illusion
in
any
case
i
do
feel
perfect
certainty
on
this
point
i
failed
to
find
any
hoof
marks
as
you
remember
the
gobbling
neighing
in
the
park
was
a
ventriloquial
achievement
on
the
part
of
parsket
and
the
attack
out
there
on
beaumont
was
also
by
him
so
that
when
i
thought
he
was
in
his
bedroom
he
must
have
been
outside
all
the
time
and
joined
me
after
i
ran
out
of
the
front
door
this
is
almost
probable
i
mean
that
parsket
was
the
cause
for
if
it
had
been
something
more
serious
he
would
certainly
have
given
up
his
foolishness
knowing
that
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
it
i
can
not
imagine
how
he
escaped
being
shot
both
then
and
in
the
last
mad
action
of
which
i
have
just
told
you
he
was
enormously
without
fear
of
any
kind
for
himself
as
you
can
see
the
time
when
parsket
was
with
us
when
we
thought
we
heard
the
horse
galloping
the
house
we
must
have
been
deceived
no
one
was
very
sure
except
of
course
parsket
who
would
naturally
encourage
the
belief
the
neighing
in
the
cellar
is
where
i
consider
there
came
the
first
suspicion
into
parsket
mind
that
there
was
something
more
at
work
than
his
sham
haunting
the
neighing
was
done
by
him
in
the
same
way
that
he
did
it
in
the
park
but
when
i
remember
how
ghastly
he
looked
i
feel
sure
that
the
sounds
must
have
had
some
infernal
quality
added
to
them
which
frightened
the
man
himself
yet
later
he
would
persuade
himself
that
he
had
been
getting
fanciful
of
course
i
must
not
forget
that
the
effect
upon
miss
hisgins
must
have
made
him
feel
pretty
miserable
then
about
the
clergyman
being
called
away
we
found
afterward
that
it
was
a
bogus
errand
or
rather
call
and
it
is
apparent
that
parsket
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
so
as
to
get
a
few
more
hours
in
which
to
achieve
his
end
and
what
that
was
a
very
little
imagination
will
show
you
for
he
had
found
that
beaumont
would
not
be
frightened
away
i
hate
to
think
this
but
i
bound
to
anyway
it
is
obvious
that
the
man
was
temporarily
a
bit
off
his
normal
balance
love
a
queer
disease
then
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
but
that
parsket
left
the
cord
to
the
butler
bell
hitched
somewhere
so
as
to
give
him
an
excuse
to
slip
away
naturally
to
clear
it
this
also
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
remove
one
of
the
passage
lamps
then
he
had
only
to
smash
the
other
and
the
passage
was
in
utter
darkness
for
him
to
make
the
attempt
on
beaumont
in
the
same
way
it
was
he
who
locked
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
took
the
key
it
was
in
his
pocket
this
prevented
the
captain
from
bringing
a
light
and
coming
to
the
rescue
but
captain
hisgins
broke
down
the
door
with
the
heavy
fender
curb
and
it
was
his
smashing
the
door
that
sounded
so
confusing
and
frightening
in
the
darkness
of
the
passage
the
photograph
of
the
monstrous
hoof
above
miss
hisgins
in
the
cellar
is
one
of
the
things
that
i
am
less
sure
about
it
might
have
been
faked
by
parsket
whilst
i
was
out
of
the
room
and
this
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
anyone
who
knew
how
but
you
know
it
does
not
look
like
a
fake
yet
there
is
as
much
evidence
of
probability
that
it
was
faked
as
against
and
the
thing
is
too
vague
for
an
examination
to
help
to
a
definite
decision
so
that
i
will
express
no
opinion
one
way
or
the
other
it
is
certainly
a
horrible
photograph
and
now
i
come
to
that
last
dreadful
thing
there
has
been
no
further
manifestation
of
anything
abnormal
so
that
there
is
an
extraordinary
uncertainty
in
my
conclusions
if
we
had
not
heard
those
last
sounds
and
if
parsket
had
not
shown
that
enormous
sense
of
fear
the
whole
of
this
case
could
be
explained
in
the
way
in
which
i
have
shown
and
in
fact
as
you
have
seen
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
almost
all
of
it
can
be
cleared
up
but
i
see
no
way
of
going
past
the
thing
we
heard
at
the
last
and
the
fear
that
parsket
showed
his
death
no
that
proves
nothing
at
the
inquest
it
was
described
somewhat
untechnically
as
due
to
heart
spasm
that
is
normal
enough
and
leaves
us
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
whether
he
died
because
he
stood
between
the
girl
and
some
incredible
thing
of
monstrosity
the
look
on
parsket
face
and
the
thing
he
called
out
when
he
heard
the
great
hoof
sounds
coming
down
the
passage
seem
to
show
that
he
had
the
sudden
realization
of
what
before
then
may
have
been
nothing
more
than
a
horrible
suspicion
and
his
fear
and
appreciation
of
some
tremendous
danger
approaching
was
probably
more
keenly
real
even
than
mine
and
then
he
did
the
one
fine
great
thing
and
the
cause
i
said
what
caused
it
carnacki
shook
his
head
god
knows
he
answered
with
a
peculiar
sincere
reverence
if
that
thing
was
what
it
seemed
to
be
one
might
suggest
an
explanation
which
would
not
offend
one
reason
but
which
may
be
utterly
wrong
yet
i
have
thought
though
it
would
take
a
long
lecture
on
thought
induction
to
get
you
to
appreciate
my
reasons
that
parsket
had
produced
what
i
might
term
a
kind
of
haunting
a
kind
of
induced
simulation
of
his
mental
conceptions
to
his
desperate
thoughts
and
broodings
it
is
impossible
to
make
it
clearer
in
a
few
words
but
the
old
story
i
said
why
may
not
there
have
been
something
in
there
may
have
been
something
in
it
said
carnacki
but
i
do
not
think
it
had
anything
to
do
with
this
i
have
not
clearly
thought
out
my
reasons
yet
but
later
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
why
i
think
so
and
the
marriage
and
the
cellar
was
there
anything
found
there
asked
taylor
yes
the
marriage
was
performed
that
day
in
spite
of
the
tragedy
carnacki
told
us
it
was
the
wisest
thing
to
do
considering
the
things
that
i
can
not
explain
yes
i
had
the
floor
of
that
big
cellar
up
for
i
had
a
feeling
i
might
find
something
there
to
give
me
some
light
but
there
was
nothing
you
know
the
whole
thing
is
tremendous
and
extraordinary
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
on
parsket
face
and
afterward
the
disgusting
sounds
of
those
great
hoofs
going
away
through
the
quiet
house
carnacki
stood
up
out
you
go
he
said
in
friendly
fashion
using
the
recognized
formula
and
we
went
presently
out
into
the
quiet
of
the
embankment
and
so
to
our
homes
no
the
searcher
of
the
end
house
it
was
still
evening
as
i
remember
and
the
four
of
us
jessop
arkright
taylor
and
i
looked
disappointedly
at
carnacki
where
he
sat
silent
in
his
great
chair
we
had
come
in
response
to
the
usual
card
of
invitation
which
as
you
know
we
have
come
to
consider
as
a
sure
prelude
to
a
good
story
and
now
after
telling
us
the
short
incident
of
the
three
straw
platters
he
had
lapsed
into
a
contented
silence
and
the
night
not
half
gone
as
i
have
hinted
however
as
it
chanced
some
pitying
fate
jogged
carnacki
elbow
or
his
memory
and
he
began
again
in
his
queer
level
way
the
platters
business
reminds
me
of
the
case
which
i
have
sometimes
thought
might
interest
you
it
was
some
time
ago
in
fact
a
deuce
of
a
long
time
ago
that
the
thing
happened
and
my
experience
of
what
i
might
term
things
was
very
small
at
that
time
i
was
living
with
my
mother
when
it
occurred
in
a
small
house
just
outside
of
appledorn
on
the
south
coast
the
house
was
the
last
of
a
row
of
detached
cottage
villas
each
house
standing
in
its
own
garden
and
very
dainty
little
places
they
were
very
old
and
most
of
them
smothered
in
roses
and
all
with
those
quaint
old
leaded
windows
and
doors
of
genuine
oak
you
must
try
to
picture
them
for
the
sake
of
their
complete
niceness
now
i
must
remind
you
at
the
beginning
that
my
mother
and
i
had
lived
in
that
little
house
for
two
years
and
in
the
whole
of
that
time
there
had
not
been
a
single
peculiar
happening
to
worry
us
and
then
something
happened
it
was
about
two
one
morning
as
i
was
finishing
some
letters
that
i
heard
the
door
of
my
mother
bedroom
open
and
she
came
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
knocked
on
the
banisters
right
dear
i
called
for
i
suppose
she
was
merely
reminding
me
that
i
should
have
been
in
bed
long
ago
then
i
heard
her
go
back
to
her
room
and
i
hurried
my
work
for
fear
she
should
lie
awake
until
she
heard
me
safe
up
to
my
room
when
i
was
finished
i
lit
my
candle
put
out
the
lamp
and
went
upstairs
as
i
came
opposite
the
door
of
my
mother
room
i
saw
that
it
was
open
called
good
night
to
her
very
softly
and
asked
whether
i
should
close
the
door
as
there
was
no
answer
i
knew
that
she
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
and
i
closed
the
door
very
gently
and
turned
into
my
room
just
across
the
passage
as
i
did
so
i
experienced
a
momentary
sense
of
a
faint
peculiar
disagreeable
odor
in
the
passage
but
it
was
not
until
the
following
night
that
i
i
had
noticed
a
smell
that
offended
me
you
follow
me
it
is
so
often
like
that
one
suddenly
knows
a
thing
that
really
recorded
itself
on
consciousness
perhaps
a
year
before
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
i
mentioned
casually
to
my
mother
that
she
had
off
and
i
had
shut
the
door
for
her
to
my
surprise
she
assured
me
she
had
never
been
out
of
her
room
i
reminded
her
about
the
two
raps
she
had
given
upon
the
banister
but
she
still
was
certain
i
must
be
mistaken
and
in
the
end
i
teased
her
saying
she
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
my
bad
habit
of
sitting
up
late
that
she
had
come
to
call
me
in
her
sleep
of
course
she
denied
this
and
i
let
the
matter
drop
but
i
was
more
than
a
little
puzzled
and
did
not
know
whether
to
believe
my
own
explanation
or
to
take
the
mater
which
was
to
put
the
noises
down
to
the
mice
and
the
open
door
to
the
fact
that
she
could
have
properly
latched
it
when
she
went
to
bed
i
suppose
away
in
the
subconscious
part
of
me
i
had
a
stirring
of
less
reasonable
thoughts
but
certainly
i
had
no
real
uneasiness
at
that
time
the
next
night
there
came
a
further
development
about
two
thirty
i
heard
my
mother
door
open
just
as
on
the
previous
night
and
immediately
afterward
she
rapped
sharply
on
the
banister
as
it
seemed
to
me
i
stopped
my
work
and
called
up
that
i
would
not
be
long
as
she
made
no
reply
and
i
did
not
hear
her
go
back
to
bed
i
had
a
quick
sense
of
wonder
whether
she
might
not
be
doing
it
in
her
sleep
after
all
just
as
i
had
said
with
the
thought
i
stood
up
and
taking
the
lamp
from
the
table
began
to
go
toward
the
door
which
was
open
into
the
passage
it
was
then
i
got
a
sudden
nasty
sort
of
thrill
for
it
came
to
me
all
at
once
that
my
mother
never
knocked
when
i
sat
up
too
late
she
always
called
you
will
understand
i
was
not
really
frightened
in
any
way
only
vaguely
uneasy
and
pretty
sure
she
must
really
be
doing
the
thing
in
her
sleep
i
went
quickly
up
the
stairs
and
when
i
came
to
the
top
my
mother
was
not
there
but
her
door
was
open
i
had
a
bewildered
sense
though
believing
she
must
have
gone
quietly
back
to
bed
without
my
hearing
her
i
entered
her
room
and
found
her
sleeping
quietly
and
naturally
for
the
vague
sense
of
trouble
in
me
was
sufficiently
strong
to
make
me
go
over
to
look
at
her
when
i
was
sure
that
she
was
perfectly
right
in
every
way
i
was
still
a
little
bothered
but
much
more
inclined
to
think
my
suspicion
correct
and
that
she
had
gone
quietly
back
to
bed
in
her
sleep
without
knowing
what
she
had
been
doing
this
was
the
most
reasonable
thing
to
think
as
you
must
see
and
then
it
came
to
me
suddenly
that
vague
queer
mildewy
smell
in
the
room
and
it
was
in
that
instant
i
became
aware
i
had
smelt
the
same
strange
uncertain
smell
the
night
before
in
the
passage
i
was
definitely
uneasy
now
and
began
to
search
my
mother
room
though
with
no
aim
or
clear
thought
of
anything
except
to
assure
myself
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
all
the
time
you
know
i
never
to
find
anything
only
my
uneasiness
had
to
be
assured
in
the
middle
of
my
search
my
mother
woke
up
and
of
course
i
had
to
explain
i
told
her
about
her
door
opening
and
the
knocks
on
the
banister
and
that
i
had
come
up
and
found
her
asleep
i
said
nothing
about
the
smell
which
was
not
very
distinct
but
told
her
that
the
thing
happening
twice
had
made
me
a
bit
nervous
and
possibly
fanciful
and
i
thought
i
would
take
a
look
just
to
feel
satisfied
i
have
thought
since
that
the
reason
i
made
no
mention
of
the
smell
was
not
only
that
i
did
not
want
to
frighten
my
mother
for
i
was
scarcely
that
myself
but
because
i
had
only
a
vague
that
i
associated
the
smell
with
fancies
too
indefinite
and
peculiar
to
bear
talking
about
you
will
understand
that
i
am
able
to
analyze
and
put
the
thing
into
words
but
i
did
not
even
know
my
chief
reason
for
saying
nothing
let
alone
appreciate
its
possible
significance
it
was
my
mother
after
all
who
put
part
of
my
vague
sensations
into
words
a
disagreeable
smell
she
exclaimed
and
was
silent
a
moment
looking
at
me
then
feel
there
something
wrong
still
looking
at
me
very
quietly
but
with
a
little
nervous
note
of
questioning
expectancy
do
know
i
said
ca
understand
it
unless
you
really
been
walking
about
in
your
sleep
smell
she
said
i
replied
what
puzzles
me
too
i
take
a
walk
through
the
house
but
i
do
suppose
it
anything
i
lit
her
candle
and
taking
the
lamp
i
went
through
the
other
bedrooms
and
afterward
all
over
the
house
including
the
three
underground
cellars
which
was
a
little
trying
to
the
nerves
seeing
that
i
was
more
nervous
than
i
would
admit
then
i
went
back
to
my
mother
and
told
her
there
was
really
nothing
to
bother
about
and
you
know
in
the
end
we
talked
ourselves
into
believing
it
was
nothing
my
mother
would
not
agree
that
she
might
have
been
sleepwalking
but
she
was
ready
to
put
the
door
opening
down
to
the
fault
of
the
latch
which
certainly
snicked
very
lightly
as
for
the
knocks
they
might
be
the
old
warped
woodwork
of
the
house
cracking
a
bit
or
a
mouse
rattling
a
piece
of
loose
plaster
the
smell
was
more
difficult
to
explain
but
finally
we
agreed
that
it
might
easily
be
the
queer
night
smell
of
the
moist
earth
coming
in
through
the
open
window
of
my
mother
room
from
the
back
garden
or
for
that
matter
from
the
little
churchyard
beyond
the
big
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
so
we
quietened
down
and
finally
i
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
i
think
this
is
certainly
a
lesson
on
the
way
we
humans
can
delude
ourselves
for
there
was
not
one
of
these
explanations
that
my
reason
could
really
accept
try
to
imagine
yourself
in
the
same
circumstances
and
you
will
see
how
absurd
our
attempts
to
explain
the
happenings
really
were
in
the
morning
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
we
talked
it
all
over
again
and
whilst
we
agreed
that
it
was
strange
we
also
agreed
that
we
had
begun
to
imagine
funny
things
in
the
backs
of
our
minds
which
now
we
felt
half
ashamed
to
admit
this
is
very
strange
when
you
come
to
look
into
it
but
very
human
and
then
that
night
again
my
mother
door
was
slammed
once
more
just
after
midnight
i
caught
up
the
lamp
and
when
i
reached
her
door
i
found
it
shut
i
opened
it
quickly
and
went
in
to
find
my
mother
lying
with
her
eyes
open
and
rather
nervous
having
been
waked
by
the
bang
of
the
door
but
what
upset
me
more
than
anything
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
disgusting
smell
in
the
passage
and
in
her
room
whilst
i
was
asking
her
whether
she
was
all
right
a
door
slammed
twice
downstairs
and
you
can
imagine
how
it
made
me
feel
my
mother
and
i
looked
at
one
another
and
then
i
lit
her
candle
and
taking
the
poker
from
the
fender
went
downstairs
with
the
lamp
beginning
to
feel
really
nervous
the
cumulative
effect
of
so
many
queer
happenings
was
getting
hold
of
me
and
all
the
reasonable
explanations
seemed
futile
the
horrible
smell
seemed
to
be
very
strong
in
the
downstairs
passage
also
in
the
front
room
and
the
cellars
but
chiefly
in
the
passage
i
made
a
very
thorough
search
of
the
house
and
when
i
had
finished
i
knew
that
all
the
lower
windows
and
doors
were
properly
shut
and
fastened
and
that
there
was
no
living
thing
in
the
house
beyond
our
two
selves
then
i
went
up
to
my
mother
room
again
and
we
talked
the
thing
over
for
an
hour
or
more
and
in
the
end
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
might
after
all
be
reading
too
much
into
a
number
of
little
things
but
you
know
inside
of
us
we
did
not
believe
this
later
when
we
had
talked
ourselves
into
a
more
comfortable
state
of
mind
i
said
good
night
and
went
off
to
bed
and
presently
managed
to
get
to
sleep
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
whilst
it
was
still
dark
i
was
waked
by
a
loud
noise
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
and
from
downstairs
i
heard
bang
bang
bang
one
door
after
another
being
slammed
at
least
that
is
the
impression
the
sounds
gave
to
me
i
jumped
out
of
bed
with
the
tingle
and
shiver
of
sudden
fright
on
me
and
at
the
same
moment
as
i
lit
my
candle
my
door
was
pushed
slowly
open
i
had
left
it
unlatched
so
as
not
to
feel
that
my
mother
was
quite
shut
off
from
me
there
i
shouted
out
in
a
voice
twice
as
deep
as
my
natural
one
and
with
a
queer
breathlessness
that
sudden
fright
so
often
gives
one
there
then
i
heard
my
mother
saying
me
thomas
whatever
is
happening
downstairs
she
was
in
the
room
by
this
and
i
saw
she
had
her
bedroom
poker
in
one
hand
and
her
candle
in
the
other
i
could
have
smiled
at
her
had
it
not
been
for
the
extraordinary
sounds
downstairs
i
got
into
my
slippers
and
reached
down
an
old
sword
bayonet
from
the
wall
then
i
picked
up
my
candle
and
begged
my
mother
not
to
come
but
i
knew
it
would
be
little
use
if
she
had
made
up
her
mind
and
she
had
with
the
result
that
she
acted
as
a
sort
of
rearguard
for
me
during
our
search
i
know
in
some
ways
i
was
very
glad
to
have
her
with
me
as
you
will
understand
by
this
time
the
door
slamming
had
ceased
and
there
seemed
probably
because
of
the
contrast
to
be
an
appalling
silence
in
the
house
however
i
led
the
way
holding
my
candle
high
and
keeping
the
sword
bayonet
very
handy
downstairs
we
found
all
the
doors
wide
open
although
the
outer
doors
and
the
windows
were
closed
all
right
i
began
to
wonder
whether
the
noises
had
been
made
by
the
doors
after
all
of
one
thing
only
were
we
sure
and
that
was
there
was
no
living
thing
in
the
house
beside
ourselves
while
everywhere
throughout
the
house
there
was
the
taint
of
that
disgusting
odor
of
course
it
was
absurd
to
try
to
make
believe
any
longer
there
was
something
strange
about
the
house
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
i
set
my
mother
to
packing
and
soon
after
breakfast
i
saw
her
off
by
train
then
i
set
to
work
to
try
to
clear
up
the
mystery
i
went
first
to
the
landlord
and
told
him
all
the
circumstances
from
him
i
found
that
twelve
or
fifteen
years
back
the
house
had
got
rather
a
curious
name
from
three
or
four
tenants
with
the
result
that
it
had
remained
empty
a
long
while
in
the
end
he
had
let
it
at
a
low
rent
to
a
captain
tobias
on
the
one
condition
that
he
should
hold
his
tongue
if
he
saw
anything
peculiar
the
landlord
idea
as
he
told
me
frankly
was
to
free
the
house
from
these
tales
of
queer
by
keeping
a
tenant
in
it
and
then
to
sell
it
for
the
best
price
he
could
get
however
when
captain
tobias
left
after
a
ten
years
tenancy
there
was
no
longer
any
talk
about
the
house
so
when
i
offered
to
take
it
on
a
five
years
lease
he
had
jumped
at
the
offer
this
was
the
whole
story
so
he
gave
me
to
understand
when
i
pressed
him
for
details
of
the
supposed
peculiar
happenings
in
the
house
all
those
years
back
he
said
the
tenants
had
talked
about
a
woman
who
always
moved
about
the
house
at
night
some
tenants
never
saw
anything
but
others
would
not
stay
out
the
first
month
tenancy
one
thing
the
landlord
was
particular
to
point
out
that
no
tenant
had
ever
complained
about
knockings
or
door
slamming
as
for
the
smell
he
seemed
positively
indignant
about
it
but
why
i
do
suppose
he
knew
himself
except
that
he
probably
had
some
vague
feeling
that
it
was
an
indirect
accusation
on
my
part
that
the
drains
were
not
right
in
the
end
i
suggested
that
he
should
come
down
and
spend
the
night
with
me
he
agreed
at
once
especially
as
i
told
him
i
intended
to
keep
the
whole
business
quiet
and
try
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
curious
affair
for
he
was
anxious
to
keep
the
rumor
of
the
haunting
from
getting
about
about
three
that
afternoon
he
came
down
and
we
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
which
however
revealed
nothing
unusual
afterward
the
landlord
made
one
or
two
tests
which
showed
him
the
drainage
was
in
perfect
order
after
that
we
made
our
preparations
for
sitting
up
all
night
first
we
borrowed
two
policemen
dark
lanterns
from
the
station
nearby
and
where
the
superintendent
and
i
were
friendly
and
as
soon
as
it
was
really
dusk
the
landlord
went
up
to
his
house
for
his
gun
i
had
the
sword
bayonet
i
have
told
you
about
and
when
the
landlord
got
back
we
sat
talking
in
my
study
until
nearly
midnight
then
we
lit
the
lanterns
and
went
upstairs
we
placed
the
lanterns
gun
and
bayonet
handy
on
the
table
then
i
shut
and
sealed
the
bedroom
doors
afterward
we
took
our
seats
and
turned
off
the
lights
from
then
until
two
nothing
happened
but
a
little
after
two
as
i
found
by
holding
my
watch
near
the
faint
glow
of
the
closed
lanterns
i
had
a
time
of
extraordinary
nervousness
and
i
bent
toward
the
landlord
and
whispered
to
him
that
i
had
a
queer
feeling
something
was
about
to
happen
and
to
be
ready
with
his
lantern
at
the
same
time
i
reached
out
toward
mine
in
the
very
instant
i
made
this
movement
the
darkness
which
filled
the
passage
seemed
to
become
suddenly
of
a
dull
violet
color
not
as
if
a
light
had
been
shone
but
as
if
the
natural
blackness
of
the
night
had
changed
color
and
then
coming
through
this
violet
night
through
this
gloom
came
a
little
naked
child
running
in
an
extraordinary
way
the
child
seemed
not
to
be
distinct
from
the
surrounding
gloom
but
almost
as
if
it
were
a
concentration
of
that
extraordinary
atmosphere
as
if
that
gloomy
color
which
had
changed
the
night
came
from
the
child
it
seems
impossible
to
make
clear
to
you
but
try
to
understand
it
the
child
went
past
me
running
with
the
natural
movement
of
the
legs
of
a
chubby
human
child
but
in
an
absolute
and
inconceivable
silence
it
was
a
very
small
child
and
must
have
passed
under
the
table
but
i
saw
the
child
through
the
table
as
if
it
had
been
only
a
slightly
darker
shadow
than
the
colored
gloom
in
the
same
instant
i
saw
that
a
fluctuating
glimmer
of
violet
light
outlined
the
metal
of
the
and
the
blade
of
the
sword
bayonet
making
them
seem
like
faint
shapes
of
glimmering
light
floating
unsupported
where
the
tabletop
should
have
shown
solid
now
curiously
as
i
saw
these
things
i
was
subconsciously
aware
that
i
heard
the
anxious
breathing
of
the
landlord
quite
clear
and
labored
close
to
my
elbow
where
he
waited
nervously
with
his
hands
on
the
lantern
i
realized
in
that
moment
that
he
saw
nothing
but
waited
in
the
darkness
for
my
warning
to
come
true
even
as
i
took
heed
of
these
minor
things
i
saw
the
child
jump
to
one
side
and
hide
behind
some
object
that
was
certainly
nothing
belonging
to
the
passage
i
stared
intently
with
a
most
extraordinary
thrill
of
expectant
wonder
with
fright
making
goose
flesh
of
my
back
and
even
as
i
stared
i
solved
for
myself
the
less
important
problem
of
what
the
two
black
clouds
were
that
hung
over
a
part
of
the
table
i
think
it
very
curious
and
interesting
the
double
working
of
the
mind
often
so
much
more
apparent
during
times
of
stress
the
two
clouds
came
from
two
faintly
shining
shapes
which
i
knew
must
be
the
metal
of
the
lanterns
and
the
things
that
looked
black
to
the
sight
with
which
i
was
then
seeing
could
be
nothing
else
but
what
to
normal
human
sight
is
known
as
light
this
phenomenon
i
have
always
remembered
i
have
twice
seen
a
somewhat
similar
thing
in
the
dark
light
case
and
in
that
trouble
of
maetheson
which
you
know
about
even
as
i
understood
this
matter
of
the
lights
i
was
looking
to
my
left
to
understand
why
the
child
was
hiding
and
suddenly
i
heard
the
landlord
shout
out
woman
but
i
saw
nothing
i
had
a
disagreeable
sense
that
something
repugnant
was
near
to
me
and
i
was
aware
in
the
same
moment
that
the
landlord
was
gripping
my
arm
in
a
hard
frightened
grip
then
i
was
looking
back
to
where
the
child
had
hidden
i
saw
the
child
peeping
out
from
behind
its
hiding
place
seeming
to
be
looking
up
the
passage
but
whether
in
fear
i
could
not
tell
then
it
came
out
and
ran
headlong
away
through
the
place
where
should
have
been
the
wall
of
my
mother
bedroom
but
the
sense
with
which
i
was
seeing
these
things
showed
me
the
wall
only
as
a
vague
upright
shadow
unsubstantial
and
immediately
the
child
was
lost
to
me
in
the
dull
violet
gloom
at
the
same
time
i
felt
the
landlord
press
back
against
me
as
if
something
had
passed
close
to
him
and
he
called
out
again
a
hoarse
sort
of
cry
woman
the
woman
and
turned
the
shade
clumsily
from
off
his
lantern
but
i
had
seen
no
woman
and
the
passage
showed
empty
as
he
shone
the
beam
of
his
light
jerkily
to
and
fro
but
chiefly
in
the
direction
of
the
doorway
of
my
mother
room
he
was
still
clutching
my
arm
and
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
now
mechanically
and
almost
slowly
i
picked
up
my
lantern
and
turned
on
the
light
i
shone
it
a
little
dazedly
at
the
seals
upon
the
doors
but
none
were
broken
then
i
sent
the
light
to
and
fro
up
and
down
the
passage
but
there
was
nothing
and
i
turned
to
the
landlord
who
was
saying
something
in
a
rather
incoherent
fashion
as
my
light
passed
over
his
face
i
noted
in
a
dull
sort
of
way
that
he
was
drenched
with
sweat
then
my
wits
became
more
handleable
and
i
began
to
catch
the
drift
of
his
words
you
see
her
did
you
see
her
he
was
saying
over
and
over
again
and
then
i
found
myself
telling
him
in
quite
a
level
voice
that
i
had
not
seen
any
woman
he
became
more
coherent
then
and
i
found
that
he
had
seen
a
woman
come
from
the
end
of
the
passage
and
go
past
us
but
he
could
not
describe
her
except
that
she
kept
stopping
and
looking
about
her
and
had
even
peered
at
the
wall
close
beside
him
as
if
looking
for
something
but
what
seemed
to
trouble
him
most
was
that
she
had
not
seemed
to
see
him
at
all
he
repeated
this
so
often
that
in
the
end
i
told
him
in
an
absurd
sort
of
way
that
he
ought
to
be
very
glad
she
had
not
what
did
it
all
mean
was
the
question
somehow
i
was
not
so
frightened
as
utterly
bewildered
i
had
seen
less
then
than
since
but
what
i
had
seen
had
made
me
feel
adrift
from
my
anchorage
of
reason
what
did
it
mean
he
had
seen
a
woman
searching
for
something
had
not
seen
this
woman
had
seen
a
child
running
away
and
hiding
from
something
or
someone
had
not
seen
the
child
or
the
other
things
only
the
woman
and
had
not
seen
her
what
did
it
all
mean
i
had
said
nothing
to
the
landlord
about
the
child
i
had
been
too
bewildered
and
i
realized
that
it
would
be
futile
to
attempt
an
explanation
he
was
already
stupid
with
the
thing
he
had
seen
and
not
the
kind
of
man
to
understand
all
this
went
through
my
mind
as
we
stood
there
shining
the
lanterns
to
and
fro
all
the
time
intermingled
with
a
streak
of
practical
reasoning
i
was
questioning
myself
what
did
it
all
mean
what
was
the
woman
searching
for
what
was
the
child
running
from
suddenly
as
i
stood
there
bewildered
and
nervous
making
random
answers
to
the
landlord
a
door
below
was
violently
slammed
and
directly
i
caught
the
horrible
reek
of
which
i
have
told
you
i
said
to
the
landlord
and
caught
his
arm
in
my
turn
smell
do
smell
it
he
looked
at
me
so
stupidly
that
in
a
sort
of
nervous
anger
i
shook
him
he
said
in
a
queer
voice
trying
to
shine
the
light
from
his
shaking
lantern
at
the
stair
head
on
i
said
and
picked
up
my
bayonet
and
he
came
carrying
his
gun
awkwardly
i
think
he
came
more
because
he
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone
than
because
he
had
any
pluck
left
poor
beggar
i
never
sneer
at
that
kind
of
funk
at
least
very
seldom
for
when
it
takes
hold
of
you
it
makes
rags
of
your
courage
i
led
the
way
downstairs
shining
my
light
into
the
lower
passage
and
afterward
at
the
doors
to
see
whether
they
were
shut
for
i
had
closed
and
latched
them
placing
a
corner
of
a
mat
against
each
door
so
i
should
know
which
had
been
opened
i
saw
at
once
that
none
of
the
doors
had
been
opened
then
i
threw
the
beam
of
my
light
down
alongside
the
stairway
in
order
to
see
the
mat
i
had
placed
against
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
cellar
stairs
i
got
a
horrid
thrill
for
the
mat
was
flat
i
paused
a
couple
of
seconds
shining
my
light
to
and
fro
in
the
passage
and
holding
fast
to
my
courage
i
went
down
the
stairs
as
i
came
to
the
bottom
step
i
saw
patches
of
wet
all
up
and
down
the
passage
i
shone
my
lantern
on
them
it
was
the
imprint
of
a
wet
foot
on
the
oilcloth
of
the
passage
not
an
ordinary
footprint
but
a
queer
soft
flabby
spreading
imprint
that
gave
me
a
feeling
of
extraordinary
horror
backward
and
forward
i
flashed
the
light
over
the
impossible
marks
and
saw
them
everywhere
suddenly
i
noticed
that
they
led
to
each
of
the
closed
doors
i
felt
something
touch
my
back
and
glanced
swiftly
to
find
the
landlord
had
come
close
to
me
almost
pressing
against
me
in
his
fear
all
right
i
said
but
in
a
rather
breathless
whisper
meaning
to
put
a
little
courage
into
him
for
i
could
feel
that
he
was
shaking
through
all
his
body
even
then
as
i
tried
to
get
him
steadied
enough
to
be
of
some
use
his
gun
went
off
with
a
tremendous
bang
he
jumped
and
yelled
with
sheer
terror
and
i
swore
because
of
the
shock
it
to
me
for
god
sake
i
said
and
slipped
the
gun
from
his
hand
and
in
the
same
instant
there
was
a
sound
of
running
steps
up
the
garden
path
and
immediately
the
flash
of
a
lantern
upon
the
fan
light
over
the
front
door
then
the
door
was
tried
and
directly
afterward
there
came
a
thunderous
knocking
which
told
me
a
policeman
had
heard
the
shot
i
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
fortunately
the
constable
knew
me
and
when
i
had
beckoned
him
in
i
was
able
to
explain
matters
in
a
very
short
time
while
doing
this
inspector
johnstone
came
up
the
path
having
missed
the
officer
and
seeing
lights
and
the
open
door
i
told
him
as
briefly
as
possible
what
had
occurred
and
did
not
mention
the
child
or
the
woman
for
it
would
have
seem
too
fantastic
for
him
to
notice
i
showed
him
the
queer
wet
footprints
and
how
they
went
toward
the
closed
doors
i
explained
quickly
about
the
mats
and
how
that
the
one
against
the
cellar
door
was
flat
which
showed
the
door
had
been
opened
the
inspector
nodded
and
told
the
constable
to
guard
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
cellar
stairs
he
then
asked
the
hall
lamp
to
be
lit
after
which
he
took
the
policeman
lantern
and
led
the
way
into
the
front
room
he
paused
with
the
door
wide
open
and
threw
the
light
all
then
he
jumped
into
the
room
and
looked
behind
the
door
there
was
no
one
there
but
all
over
the
polished
oak
floor
between
the
scattered
rugs
went
the
marks
of
those
horrible
spreading
footprints
and
the
room
permeated
with
the
horrible
odor
the
inspector
searched
the
room
carefully
and
then
went
into
the
middle
room
using
the
same
precautions
there
was
nothing
in
the
middle
room
or
in
the
kitchen
or
pantry
but
everywhere
went
the
wet
footmarks
through
all
the
rooms
showing
plainly
wherever
there
were
woodwork
or
oilcloth
and
always
there
was
the
smell
the
inspector
ceased
from
his
search
of
the
rooms
and
spent
a
minute
in
trying
whether
the
mats
would
really
fall
flat
when
the
doors
were
open
or
merely
ruckle
up
in
a
way
as
to
appear
they
had
been
untouched
but
in
each
case
the
mats
fell
flat
and
remained
so
i
heard
johnstone
mutter
to
himself
and
then
he
went
toward
the
cellar
door
he
had
inquired
at
first
whether
there
were
windows
to
the
cellar
and
when
he
learned
there
was
no
way
out
except
by
the
door
he
had
left
this
part
of
the
search
to
the
last
as
johnstone
came
up
to
the
door
the
policeman
made
a
motion
of
salute
and
said
something
in
a
low
voice
and
something
in
the
tone
made
me
flick
my
light
across
him
i
saw
then
that
the
man
was
very
white
and
he
looked
strange
and
bewildered
said
johnstone
impatiently
up
woman
come
along
sir
and
went
through
this
door
said
the
constable
clearly
but
with
a
curious
monotonous
intonation
that
is
sometimes
heard
from
an
unintelligent
man
up
shouted
the
inspector
woman
come
along
and
went
through
this
door
repeated
the
man
monotonously
the
inspector
caught
the
man
by
the
shoulder
and
deliberately
sniffed
his
breath
he
said
and
then
sarcastically
hope
you
held
the
door
open
politely
for
the
lady
door
were
opened
sir
said
the
man
simply
you
mad
began
johnstone
broke
in
the
landlord
voice
from
the
back
speaking
steadily
enough
saw
the
woman
upstairs
it
was
evident
that
he
had
got
back
his
control
again
afraid
inspector
johnstone
i
said
there
more
in
this
than
you
think
i
certainly
saw
some
very
extraordinary
things
upstairs
the
inspector
seemed
about
to
say
something
but
instead
he
turned
again
to
the
door
and
flashed
his
light
down
and
about
the
mat
i
saw
then
that
the
strange
horrible
footmarks
came
straight
up
to
the
cellar
door
and
the
last
print
showed
the
door
yet
the
policeman
said
the
door
had
not
been
opened
and
suddenly
without
any
intention
or
realization
of
what
i
was
saying
i
asked
the
landlord
were
the
feet
like
i
received
no
answer
for
the
inspector
was
ordering
the
constable
to
open
the
cellar
door
and
the
man
was
not
obeying
johnstone
repeated
the
order
and
at
last
in
a
queer
automatic
way
the
man
obeyed
and
pushed
the
door
open
the
loathsome
smell
beat
up
at
us
in
a
great
wave
of
horror
and
the
inspector
came
backward
a
step
god
he
said
and
went
forward
again
and
shone
his
light
down
the
steps
but
there
was
nothing
visible
only
that
on
each
step
showed
the
unnatural
footprints
the
inspector
brought
the
beam
of
the
light
vividly
on
the
top
step
and
there
clear
in
the
light
there
was
something
small
moving
the
inspector
bent
to
look
and
the
policeman
and
i
with
him
i
do
want
to
disgust
you
but
the
thing
we
looked
at
was
a
maggot
the
policeman
backed
suddenly
out
of
the
doorway
churchyard
he
said
at
the
back
of
the
said
johnstone
with
a
queer
break
in
the
word
and
i
knew
that
at
last
he
was
frightened
he
put
his
lantern
into
the
doorway
and
shone
it
from
step
to
step
following
the
footprints
down
into
the
darkness
then
he
stepped
back
from
the
open
doorway
and
we
all
gave
back
with
him
he
looked
and
i
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
looking
for
a
weapon
of
some
kind
gun
i
said
to
the
landlord
and
he
brought
it
from
the
front
hall
and
passed
it
over
to
the
inspector
who
took
it
and
ejected
the
empty
shell
from
the
right
barrel
he
held
out
his
hand
for
a
live
cartridge
which
the
landlord
brought
from
his
pocket
he
loaded
the
gun
and
snapped
the
breech
he
turned
to
the
constable
on
he
said
and
moved
toward
the
cellar
doorway
ai
comin
sir
said
the
policeman
very
white
in
the
face
with
a
sudden
blaze
of
passion
the
inspector
took
the
man
by
the
scruff
and
hove
him
bodily
down
into
the
darkness
and
he
went
downward
screaming
the
inspector
followed
him
instantly
with
his
lantern
and
the
gun
and
i
after
the
inspector
with
the
bayonet
ready
behind
me
i
heard
the
landlord
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
the
inspector
was
helping
the
policeman
to
his
feet
where
he
stood
swaying
a
moment
in
a
bewildered
fashion
then
the
inspector
went
into
the
front
cellar
and
his
man
followed
him
in
stupid
fashion
but
evidently
no
longer
with
any
thought
of
running
away
from
the
horror
we
all
crowded
into
the
front
cellar
flashing
our
lights
to
and
fro
inspector
johnstone
was
examining
the
floor
and
i
saw
that
the
footmarks
went
all
the
cellar
into
all
the
corners
and
across
the
floor
i
thought
suddenly
of
the
child
that
was
running
away
from
something
do
you
see
the
thing
that
i
was
seeing
vaguely
we
went
out
of
the
cellar
in
a
body
for
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
in
the
next
cellar
the
footprints
went
everywhere
in
that
queer
erratic
fashion
as
of
someone
searching
for
something
or
following
some
blind
scent
in
the
third
cellar
the
prints
ended
at
the
shallow
well
that
had
been
the
old
water
supply
of
the
house
the
well
was
full
to
the
brim
and
the
water
so
clear
that
the
pebbly
bottom
was
plainly
to
be
seen
as
we
shone
the
lights
into
the
water
the
search
came
to
an
abrupt
end
and
we
stood
about
the
well
looking
at
one
another
in
an
absolute
horrible
silence
johnstone
made
another
examination
of
the
footprints
then
he
shone
his
light
again
into
the
clear
shallow
water
searching
each
inch
of
the
plainly
seen
bottom
but
there
was
nothing
there
the
cellar
was
full
of
the
dreadful
smell
and
everyone
stood
silent
except
for
the
constant
turning
of
the
lamps
to
and
fro
around
the
cellar
the
inspector
looked
up
from
his
search
of
the
well
and
nodded
quietly
across
at
me
with
his
sudden
acknowledgment
that
our
belief
was
now
his
belief
the
smell
in
the
cellar
seemed
to
grow
more
dreadful
and
to
be
as
it
were
a
menace
the
material
expression
that
some
monstrous
thing
was
there
with
us
invisible
think
began
the
inspector
and
shone
his
light
toward
the
stairway
and
at
this
the
constable
restraint
went
utterly
and
he
ran
for
the
stairs
making
a
queer
sound
in
his
throat
the
landlord
followed
at
a
quick
walk
and
then
the
inspector
and
i
he
waited
a
single
instant
for
me
and
we
went
up
together
treading
on
the
same
steps
and
with
our
lights
held
backward
at
the
top
i
slammed
and
locked
the
stair
door
and
wiped
my
forehead
and
my
hands
were
shaking
the
inspector
asked
me
to
give
his
man
a
glass
of
whisky
and
then
he
sent
him
on
his
beat
he
stayed
a
short
while
with
the
landlord
and
me
and
it
was
arranged
that
he
would
join
us
again
the
following
night
and
watch
the
well
with
us
from
midnight
until
daylight
then
he
left
us
just
as
the
dawn
was
coming
in
the
landlord
and
i
locked
up
the
house
and
went
over
to
his
place
for
a
sleep
in
the
afternoon
the
landlord
and
i
returned
to
the
house
to
make
arrangements
for
the
night
he
was
very
quiet
and
i
felt
he
was
to
be
relied
on
now
that
he
had
been
as
it
were
with
his
fright
of
the
previous
night
we
opened
all
the
doors
and
windows
and
blew
the
house
through
very
thoroughly
and
in
the
meanwhile
we
lit
the
lamps
in
the
house
and
took
them
into
the
cellars
where
we
set
them
all
about
so
as
to
have
light
everywhere
then
we
carried
down
three
chairs
and
a
table
and
set
them
in
the
cellar
where
the
well
was
sunk
after
that
we
stretched
thin
piano
wire
across
the
cellar
about
nine
inches
from
the
floor
at
such
a
height
that
it
should
catch
anything
moving
about
in
the
dark
when
this
was
done
i
went
through
the
house
with
the
landlord
and
sealed
every
window
and
door
in
the
place
excepting
only
the
front
door
and
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
cellar
stairs
meanwhile
a
local
was
making
something
to
my
order
and
when
the
landlord
and
i
had
finished
tea
at
his
house
we
went
down
to
see
how
the
smith
was
getting
on
we
found
the
thing
complete
it
looked
rather
like
a
huge
parrot
cage
without
any
bottom
of
very
heavy
gage
wire
and
stood
about
seven
feet
high
and
was
four
feet
in
diameter
fortunately
i
remembered
to
have
it
made
longitudinally
in
two
halves
or
else
we
should
never
have
got
it
through
the
doorways
and
down
the
cellar
stairs
i
told
the
to
bring
the
cage
up
to
the
house
so
he
could
fit
the
two
halves
rigidly
together
as
we
returned
i
called
in
at
an
ironmonger
where
i
bought
some
thin
hemp
rope
and
an
iron
rack
pulley
like
those
used
in
lancashire
for
hauling
up
the
ceiling
clothes
racks
which
you
will
find
in
every
cottage
i
bought
also
a
couple
of
pitchforks
sha
want
to
touch
it
i
said
to
the
landlord
and
he
nodded
rather
white
all
at
once
as
soon
as
the
cage
arrived
and
had
been
fitted
together
in
the
cellar
i
sent
away
the
smith
and
the
landlord
and
i
suspended
it
over
the
well
into
which
it
fitted
easily
after
a
lot
of
trouble
we
managed
to
hang
it
so
perfectly
central
from
the
rope
over
the
iron
pulley
that
when
hoisted
to
the
ceiling
and
dropped
it
went
every
time
plunk
into
the
well
like
a
when
we
had
it
finally
arranged
i
hoisted
it
up
once
more
to
the
ready
position
and
made
the
rope
fast
to
a
heavy
wooden
pillar
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
cellar
by
ten
i
had
everything
arranged
with
the
two
pitchforks
and
the
two
police
lanterns
also
some
whisky
and
sandwiches
underneath
the
table
i
had
several
buckets
full
of
disinfectant
a
little
after
eleven
there
was
a
knock
at
the
front
door
and
when
i
went
i
found
inspector
johnstone
had
arrived
and
brought
with
him
one
of
his
plainclothes
men
you
will
understand
how
pleased
i
was
to
see
there
would
be
this
addition
to
our
watch
for
he
looked
a
tough
nerveless
man
brainy
and
collected
and
one
i
should
have
picked
to
help
us
with
the
horrible
job
i
felt
pretty
sure
we
should
have
to
do
that
night
when
the
inspector
and
the
detective
had
entered
i
shut
and
locked
the
front
door
then
while
the
inspector
held
the
light
i
sealed
the
door
carefully
with
tape
and
wax
at
the
head
of
the
cellar
stairs
i
shut
and
locked
that
door
also
and
sealed
it
in
the
same
way
as
we
entered
the
cellar
i
warned
johnstone
and
his
man
to
be
careful
not
to
fall
over
the
wires
and
then
as
i
saw
his
surprise
at
my
arrangements
i
began
to
explain
my
ideas
and
intentions
to
all
of
which
he
listened
with
strong
approval
i
was
pleased
to
see
also
that
the
detective
was
nodding
his
head
as
i
talked
in
a
way
that
showed
he
appreciated
all
my
precautions
as
he
put
his
lantern
down
the
inspector
picked
up
one
of
the
pitchforks
and
balanced
it
in
his
hand
he
looked
at
me
and
nodded
best
thing
he
said
only
wish
you
got
two
more
then
we
all
took
our
seats
the
detective
getting
a
washing
stool
from
the
corner
of
the
cellar
from
then
until
a
quarter
to
twelve
we
talked
quietly
whilst
we
made
a
light
supper
of
whisky
and
sandwiches
after
which
we
cleared
everything
off
the
table
excepting
the
lanterns
and
the
pitchforks
one
of
the
latter
i
handed
to
the
inspector
the
other
i
took
myself
and
then
having
set
my
chair
so
as
to
be
handy
to
the
rope
which
lowered
the
cage
into
the
well
i
went
the
cellar
and
put
out
every
lamp
i
groped
my
way
to
my
chair
and
arranged
the
pitchfork
and
the
dark
lantern
ready
to
my
hand
after
which
i
suggested
that
everyone
should
keep
an
absolute
silence
throughout
the
watch
i
asked
also
that
no
lantern
should
be
turned
on
until
i
gave
the
word
i
put
my
watch
on
the
table
where
a
faint
glow
from
my
lantern
made
me
able
to
see
the
time
for
an
hour
nothing
happened
and
everyone
kept
an
absolute
silence
except
for
an
occasional
uneasy
movement
about
one
however
i
was
conscious
again
of
the
same
extraordinary
and
peculiar
nervousness
which
i
had
felt
on
the
previous
night
i
put
my
hand
out
quickly
and
eased
the
hitched
rope
from
around
the
pillar
the
inspector
seemed
aware
of
the
movement
for
i
saw
the
faint
light
from
his
lantern
move
a
little
as
if
he
had
suddenly
taken
hold
of
it
in
readiness
a
minute
later
i
noticed
there
was
a
change
in
the
color
of
the
night
in
the
cellar
and
it
grew
slowly
violet
tinted
upon
my
eyes
i
glanced
to
and
fro
quickly
in
the
new
darkness
and
even
as
i
looked
i
was
conscious
that
the
violet
color
deepened
in
the
direction
of
the
well
but
seeming
to
be
at
a
great
distance
there
was
as
it
were
a
nucleus
to
the
change
and
the
nucleus
came
swiftly
toward
us
appearing
to
come
from
a
great
space
almost
in
a
single
moment
it
came
near
and
i
saw
again
that
it
was
a
little
naked
child
running
and
seeming
to
be
of
the
violet
night
in
which
it
ran
the
child
came
with
a
natural
running
movement
exactly
as
i
described
it
before
but
in
a
silence
so
peculiarly
intense
that
it
was
as
if
it
brought
the
silence
with
it
about
between
the
well
and
the
table
the
child
turned
swiftly
and
looked
back
at
something
invisible
to
me
and
suddenly
it
went
down
into
a
crouching
attitude
and
seemed
to
be
hiding
behind
something
that
showed
vaguely
but
there
was
nothing
there
except
the
bare
floor
of
the
cellar
nothing
i
mean
of
our
world
i
could
hear
the
breathing
of
the
three
other
men
with
a
wonderful
distinctness
and
also
the
tick
of
my
watch
upon
the
table
seemed
to
sound
as
loud
and
as
slow
as
the
tick
of
an
old
grandfather
clock
someway
i
knew
that
none
of
the
others
saw
what
i
was
seeing
abruptly
the
landlord
who
was
next
to
me
let
out
his
breath
with
a
little
hissing
sound
i
knew
then
that
something
was
visible
to
him
there
came
a
creak
from
the
table
and
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
inspector
was
leaning
forward
looking
at
something
that
i
could
not
see
the
landlord
reached
out
his
hand
through
the
darkness
and
fumbled
a
moment
to
catch
my
arm
woman
he
whispered
close
to
my
ear
by
the
well
i
stared
hard
in
that
direction
but
saw
nothing
except
that
the
violet
color
of
the
cellar
seemed
a
little
duller
just
there
i
looked
back
quickly
to
the
vague
place
where
the
child
was
hiding
i
saw
it
was
peering
back
from
its
hiding
place
suddenly
it
rose
and
ran
straight
for
the
middle
of
the
table
which
showed
only
as
vague
shadow
between
my
eyes
and
the
unseen
floor
as
the
child
ran
under
the
table
the
steel
prongs
of
my
pitchfork
glimmered
with
a
violet
fluctuating
light
a
little
way
off
there
showed
high
up
in
the
gloom
the
vaguely
shining
outline
of
the
other
fork
so
i
knew
the
inspector
had
it
raised
in
his
hand
ready
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
he
saw
something
on
the
table
the
metal
of
the
five
lanterns
shone
with
the
same
strange
glow
and
about
each
lantern
there
was
a
little
cloud
of
absolute
blackness
where
the
phenomenon
that
is
light
to
our
natural
eyes
came
through
the
fittings
and
in
this
complete
darkness
the
metal
of
each
lantern
showed
plain
as
might
a
in
a
nest
of
black
cotton
wool
just
beyond
the
table
the
child
paused
again
and
stood
seeming
to
oscillate
a
little
upon
its
feet
which
gave
the
impression
that
it
was
lighter
and
vaguer
than
a
and
yet
in
the
same
moment
another
part
of
me
seemed
to
know
that
it
was
to
me
as
something
that
might
be
beyond
thick
invisible
glass
and
subject
to
conditions
and
forces
that
i
was
unable
to
comprehend
the
child
was
looking
back
again
and
my
gaze
went
the
same
way
i
stared
across
the
cellar
and
saw
the
cage
hanging
clear
in
the
violet
light
every
wire
and
tie
outlined
with
its
glimmering
above
it
there
was
a
little
space
of
gloom
and
then
the
dull
shining
of
the
iron
pulley
which
i
had
screwed
into
the
ceiling
i
stared
in
a
bewildered
way
the
cellar
there
were
thin
lines
of
vague
fire
crossing
the
floor
in
all
directions
and
suddenly
i
remembered
the
piano
wire
that
the
landlord
and
i
had
stretched
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
seen
except
that
near
the
table
there
were
indistinct
glimmerings
of
light
and
at
the
far
end
the
outline
of
a
dull
glowing
revolver
evidently
in
the
detective
pocket
i
remember
a
sort
of
subconscious
satisfaction
as
i
settled
the
point
in
a
queer
automatic
fashion
on
the
table
near
to
me
there
was
a
little
shapeless
collection
of
the
light
and
this
i
knew
after
an
consideration
to
be
the
steel
portions
of
my
watch
i
had
looked
several
times
at
the
child
and
at
the
cellar
whilst
i
was
decided
these
trifles
and
had
found
it
still
in
that
attitude
of
hiding
from
something
but
now
suddenly
it
ran
clear
away
into
the
distance
and
was
nothing
more
than
a
slightly
deeper
colored
nucleus
far
away
in
the
strange
colored
atmosphere
the
landlord
gave
out
a
queer
little
cry
and
twisted
over
against
me
as
if
to
avoid
something
from
the
inspector
there
came
a
sharp
breathing
sound
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
drenched
with
cold
water
then
suddenly
the
violet
color
went
out
of
the
night
and
i
was
conscious
of
the
nearness
of
something
monstrous
and
repugnant
there
was
a
tense
silence
and
the
blackness
of
the
cellar
seemed
absolute
with
only
the
faint
glow
about
each
of
the
lanterns
on
the
table
then
in
the
darkness
and
the
silence
there
came
a
faint
tinkle
of
water
from
the
well
as
if
something
were
rising
noiselessly
out
of
it
and
the
water
running
back
with
a
gentle
tinkling
in
the
same
instant
there
came
to
me
a
sudden
waft
of
the
awful
smell
i
gave
a
sharp
cry
of
warning
to
the
inspector
and
loosed
the
rope
there
came
instantly
the
sharp
splash
of
the
cage
entering
the
water
and
then
with
a
stiff
frightened
movement
i
opened
the
shutter
of
my
lantern
and
shone
the
light
at
the
cage
shouting
to
the
others
to
do
the
same
as
my
light
struck
the
cage
i
saw
that
about
two
feet
of
it
projected
from
the
top
of
the
well
and
there
was
something
protruding
up
out
of
the
water
into
the
cage
i
stared
with
a
feeling
that
i
recognized
the
thing
and
then
as
the
other
lanterns
were
opened
i
saw
that
it
was
a
leg
of
mutton
the
thing
was
held
by
a
brawny
fist
and
arm
that
rose
out
of
the
water
i
stood
utterly
bewildered
watching
to
see
what
was
coming
in
a
moment
there
rose
into
view
a
great
bearded
face
that
i
felt
for
one
quick
instant
was
the
face
of
a
drowned
man
long
dead
then
the
face
opened
at
the
mouth
part
and
spluttered
and
coughed
another
big
hand
came
into
view
and
wiped
the
water
from
the
eyes
which
blinked
rapidly
and
then
fixed
themselves
into
a
stare
at
the
lights
from
the
detective
there
came
a
sudden
shout
tobias
he
shouted
and
the
inspector
echoed
him
and
instantly
burst
into
loud
roars
of
laughter
the
inspector
and
the
detective
ran
across
the
cellar
to
the
cage
and
i
followed
still
bewildered
the
man
in
the
cage
was
holding
the
leg
of
mutton
as
far
away
from
him
as
possible
and
holding
his
nose
thig
dam
trap
quig
he
shouted
in
a
stifled
voice
but
the
inspector
and
the
detective
simply
doubled
before
him
and
tried
to
hold
their
noses
whilst
they
laughed
and
the
light
from
their
lanterns
went
dancing
all
over
the
place
quig
said
the
man
in
the
cage
still
holding
his
nose
and
trying
to
speak
plainly
then
johnstone
and
the
detective
stopped
laughing
and
lifted
the
cage
the
man
in
the
well
threw
the
leg
across
the
cellar
and
turned
swiftly
to
go
down
into
the
well
but
the
officers
were
too
quick
for
him
and
had
him
out
in
a
twinkling
whilst
they
held
him
dripping
upon
the
floor
the
inspector
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
offending
leg
and
the
landlord
having
harpooned
it
with
one
of
the
pitchforks
ran
with
it
upstairs
and
so
into
the
open
air
meanwhile
i
had
given
the
man
from
the
well
a
stiff
tot
of
whisky
for
which
he
thanked
me
with
a
cheerful
nod
and
having
emptied
the
glass
at
a
draft
held
his
hand
for
the
bottle
which
he
finished
as
if
it
had
been
so
much
water
as
you
will
remember
it
was
a
captain
tobias
who
had
been
the
previous
tenant
and
this
was
the
very
man
who
had
appeared
from
the
well
in
the
course
of
the
talk
that
followed
i
learned
the
reason
for
captain
tobias
leaving
the
house
he
had
been
wanted
by
the
police
for
smuggling
he
had
undergone
imprisonment
and
had
been
released
only
a
couple
of
weeks
earlier
he
had
returned
to
find
new
tenants
in
his
old
home
he
had
entered
the
house
through
the
well
the
walls
of
which
were
not
continued
to
the
bottom
this
i
will
deal
with
later
and
gone
up
by
a
little
stairway
in
the
cellar
wall
which
opened
at
the
top
through
a
panel
beside
my
mother
bedroom
this
panel
was
opened
by
revolving
the
left
doorpost
of
the
bedroom
door
with
the
result
that
the
bedroom
door
always
became
unlatched
in
the
process
of
opening
the
panel
the
captain
complained
without
any
bitterness
that
the
panel
had
warped
and
that
each
time
he
opened
it
it
made
a
cracking
noise
this
had
been
evidently
what
i
mistook
for
raps
he
would
not
give
his
reason
for
entering
the
house
but
it
was
pretty
obvious
that
he
had
hidden
something
which
he
wanted
to
get
however
as
he
found
it
impossible
to
get
into
the
house
without
the
risk
of
being
caught
he
decided
to
try
to
drive
us
out
relying
on
the
bad
reputation
of
the
house
and
his
own
artistic
efforts
as
a
ghost
i
must
say
he
succeeded
he
intended
then
to
rent
the
house
again
as
before
and
would
then
of
course
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
whatever
he
had
hidden
the
house
suited
him
admirably
for
there
was
a
passage
as
he
showed
me
afterward
connecting
the
dummy
well
with
the
crypt
of
the
church
beyond
the
garden
wall
and
these
in
turn
were
connected
with
certain
caves
in
the
cliffs
which
went
down
to
the
beach
beyond
the
church
in
the
course
of
his
talk
captain
tobias
offered
to
take
the
house
off
my
hands
and
as
this
suited
me
perfectly
for
i
was
about
stalled
with
it
and
the
plan
also
suited
the
landlord
it
was
decided
that
no
steps
should
be
taken
against
him
and
that
the
whole
business
should
be
hushed
up
i
asked
the
captain
whether
there
was
really
anything
queer
about
the
house
whether
he
had
ever
seen
anything
he
said
yes
that
he
had
twice
seen
a
woman
going
about
the
house
we
all
looked
at
one
another
when
the
captain
said
that
he
told
us
she
never
bothered
him
and
that
he
had
only
seen
her
twice
and
on
each
occasion
it
had
followed
a
narrow
escape
from
the
revenue
people
captain
tobias
was
an
observant
man
he
had
seen
how
i
had
placed
the
mats
against
the
doors
and
after
entering
the
rooms
and
walking
all
about
them
so
as
to
leave
the
of
an
old
pair
of
wet
woollen
slippers
everywhere
he
had
deliberately
put
the
mats
back
as
he
found
them
the
maggot
which
had
dropped
from
his
disgusting
leg
of
mutton
had
been
an
accident
and
beyond
even
his
horrible
planning
he
was
hugely
delighted
to
learn
how
it
had
affected
us
the
moldy
smell
i
had
noticed
was
from
the
little
closed
stairway
when
the
captain
opened
the
panel
the
door
slamming
was
also
another
of
his
contributions
i
come
now
to
the
end
of
the
captain
ghost
play
and
to
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
explain
the
other
peculiar
things
in
the
first
place
it
was
obvious
there
was
something
genuinely
strange
in
the
house
which
made
itself
manifest
as
a
woman
many
different
people
had
seen
this
woman
under
differing
circumstances
so
it
is
impossible
to
put
the
thing
down
to
fancy
at
the
same
time
it
must
seem
extraordinary
that
i
should
have
lived
two
years
in
the
house
and
seen
nothing
whilst
the
policeman
saw
the
woman
before
he
had
been
there
twenty
minutes
the
landlord
the
detective
and
the
inspector
all
saw
her
i
can
only
surmise
that
was
in
every
case
the
key
as
i
might
say
which
opened
the
senses
to
the
presence
of
the
woman
the
policeman
was
a
man
and
when
he
became
frightened
was
able
to
see
the
woman
the
same
reasoning
applies
all
saw
nothing
until
i
became
really
frightened
then
i
saw
not
the
woman
but
a
child
running
away
from
something
or
someone
however
i
will
touch
on
that
later
in
short
until
a
very
strong
degree
of
fear
was
present
no
one
was
affected
by
the
force
which
made
itself
evident
as
a
woman
my
theory
explains
why
some
tenants
were
never
aware
of
anything
strange
in
the
house
whilst
others
left
immediately
the
more
sensitive
they
were
the
less
would
be
the
degree
of
fear
necessary
to
make
them
aware
of
the
force
present
in
the
house
the
peculiar
shining
of
all
the
metal
objects
in
the
cellar
had
been
visible
only
to
me
the
cause
naturally
i
do
not
know
neither
do
i
know
why
i
alone
was
able
to
see
the
shining
the
child
i
asked
can
you
explain
that
part
at
all
why
see
the
woman
and
why
did
see
the
child
was
it
merely
the
same
force
appearing
differently
to
different
people
no
said
carnacki
i
ca
explain
that
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
woman
and
the
child
were
not
only
two
complete
and
different
entities
but
even
they
were
each
not
in
quite
the
same
planes
of
existence
to
give
you
a
root
idea
however
it
is
held
in
the
sigsand
that
a
child
is
back
bye
thee
haggs
this
is
crude
but
may
yet
contain
an
elemental
truth
yet
before
i
make
this
clearer
let
me
tell
you
a
thought
that
has
often
been
made
it
may
be
that
physical
birth
is
but
a
secondary
process
and
that
prior
to
the
possibility
the
mother
spirit
searches
for
until
it
finds
the
small
element
the
primal
ego
or
child
soul
it
may
be
that
a
certain
waywardness
would
cause
such
to
strive
to
evade
capture
by
the
mother
spirit
it
may
have
been
such
a
thing
as
this
that
i
saw
i
have
always
tried
to
think
so
but
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
the
sense
of
repulsion
that
i
felt
when
the
unseen
woman
went
past
me
this
repulsion
carries
forward
the
idea
suggested
in
the
sigsand
that
a
stillborn
child
is
thus
because
its
ego
or
spirit
has
been
snatched
back
by
the
in
other
words
by
certain
of
the
monstrosities
of
the
outer
circle
the
thought
is
inconceivably
terrible
and
probably
the
more
so
because
it
is
so
fragmentary
it
leaves
us
with
the
conception
of
a
child
soul
adrift
between
two
lives
and
running
through
eternity
from
something
incredible
and
inconceivable
because
not
understood
to
our
senses
the
thing
is
beyond
further
discussion
for
it
is
futile
to
attempt
to
discuss
a
thing
to
any
purpose
of
which
one
has
a
knowledge
so
fragmentary
as
this
there
is
one
thought
which
is
often
mine
perhaps
there
is
a
mother
spirit
and
the
well
said
arkwright
how
did
the
captain
get
in
from
the
other
side
as
i
said
before
answered
carnacki
the
side
walls
of
the
well
did
not
reach
to
the
bottom
so
that
you
had
only
to
dip
down
into
the
water
and
come
up
again
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
under
the
cellar
floor
and
so
climb
into
the
passage
of
course
the
water
was
the
same
height
on
both
sides
of
the
walls
do
ask
me
who
made
the
well
entrance
or
the
little
stairway
for
i
do
know
the
house
was
very
old
as
i
have
told
you
and
that
sort
of
thing
was
useful
in
the
old
days
and
the
child
i
said
coming
back
to
the
thing
which
chiefly
interested
me
you
would
say
that
the
birth
must
have
occurred
in
that
house
and
in
this
way
one
might
suppose
that
the
house
to
have
become
if
i
can
use
the
word
in
that
way
with
the
forces
that
produced
the
tragedy
yes
replied
carnacki
this
is
supposing
we
take
the
suggestion
of
the
sigsand
to
account
for
the
phenomenon
there
may
be
other
houses
i
began
there
are
said
carnacki
and
stood
up
out
you
go
he
said
genially
using
the
recognized
formula
and
in
five
minutes
we
were
on
the
embankment
going
thoughtfully
to
our
various
homes
no
the
thing
invisible
carnacki
had
just
returned
to
cheyne
walk
chelsea
i
was
aware
of
this
interesting
fact
by
reason
of
the
curt
and
quaintly
worded
postcard
which
i
was
rereading
and
by
which
i
was
requested
to
present
myself
at
his
house
not
later
than
seven
on
that
evening
carnacki
had
as
i
and
the
others
of
his
strictly
limited
circle
of
friends
knew
been
away
in
kent
for
the
past
three
weeks
but
beyond
that
we
had
no
knowledge
carnacki
was
genially
secretive
and
curt
and
spoke
only
when
he
was
ready
to
speak
when
this
stage
arrived
i
and
his
three
other
friends
jessop
arkright
and
taylor
would
receive
a
card
or
a
wire
asking
us
to
call
not
one
of
us
ever
willingly
missed
for
after
a
thoroughly
sensible
little
dinner
carnacki
would
snuggle
down
into
his
big
armchair
light
his
pipe
and
wait
whilst
we
arranged
ourselves
comfortably
in
our
accustomed
seats
and
nooks
then
he
would
begin
to
talk
upon
this
particular
night
i
was
the
first
to
arrive
and
found
carnacki
sitting
quietly
smoking
over
a
paper
he
stood
up
shook
me
firmly
by
the
hand
pointed
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
again
never
having
uttered
a
word
for
my
part
i
said
nothing
either
i
knew
the
man
too
well
to
bother
him
with
questions
or
the
weather
and
so
took
a
seat
and
a
cigarette
presently
the
three
others
turned
up
and
after
that
we
spent
a
comfortable
and
busy
hour
at
dinner
dinner
over
carnacki
snugged
himself
down
into
his
great
chair
as
i
have
said
was
his
habit
filled
his
pipe
and
puffed
for
awhile
his
gaze
directed
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
the
rest
of
us
if
i
may
so
express
it
made
ourselves
cozy
each
after
his
own
particular
manner
a
minute
or
so
later
carnacki
began
to
speak
ignoring
any
preliminary
remarks
and
going
straight
to
the
subject
of
the
story
we
knew
he
had
to
tell
i
have
just
come
back
from
sir
alfred
jarnock
place
at
burtontree
in
south
kent
he
began
without
removing
his
gaze
from
the
fire
most
extraordinary
things
have
been
happening
down
there
lately
and
george
jarnock
the
eldest
son
wired
to
ask
me
to
run
over
and
see
whether
i
could
help
to
clear
matters
up
a
bit
i
went
when
i
got
there
i
found
that
they
have
an
old
chapel
attached
to
the
castle
which
has
had
quite
a
distinguished
reputation
for
being
what
is
popularly
termed
they
have
been
rather
proud
of
this
as
i
managed
to
discover
until
quite
lately
when
something
very
disagreeable
occurred
which
served
to
remind
them
that
family
ghosts
are
not
always
content
as
i
might
say
to
remain
purely
ornamental
it
sounds
almost
laughable
i
know
to
hear
of
a
supernatural
phenomenon
growing
unexpectedly
dangerous
and
in
this
case
the
tale
of
the
haunting
was
considered
as
little
more
than
an
old
myth
except
after
nightfall
when
possibly
it
became
more
plausible
seeming
but
however
this
may
be
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
but
that
what
i
might
term
the
haunting
essence
which
lived
in
the
place
had
become
suddenly
dangerous
deadly
dangerous
too
the
old
butler
being
nearly
stabbed
to
death
one
night
in
the
chapel
with
a
peculiar
old
dagger
it
is
in
fact
this
dagger
which
is
popularly
supposed
to
the
chapel
at
least
there
has
been
always
a
story
handed
down
in
the
family
that
this
dagger
would
attack
any
enemy
who
should
dare
to
venture
into
the
chapel
after
nightfall
but
of
course
this
had
been
taken
with
just
about
the
same
amount
of
seriousness
that
people
take
most
ghost
tales
and
that
is
not
usually
of
a
worryingly
nature
i
mean
that
most
people
never
quite
know
how
much
or
how
little
they
believe
of
matters
or
and
generally
they
never
have
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
indeed
as
you
are
all
aware
i
am
as
big
a
skeptic
concerning
the
truth
of
ghost
tales
as
any
man
you
are
likely
to
meet
only
i
am
what
i
might
term
an
unprejudiced
skeptic
i
am
not
given
to
either
believing
or
disbelieving
things
principle
as
i
have
found
many
idiots
prone
to
be
and
what
is
more
some
of
them
not
ashamed
to
boast
of
the
insane
fact
i
view
all
reported
as
unproven
until
i
have
examined
into
them
and
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
cases
in
a
hundred
turn
out
to
be
sheer
bosh
and
fancy
but
the
hundredth
well
if
it
were
not
for
the
hundredth
i
should
have
few
stories
to
tell
you
eh
of
course
after
the
attack
on
the
butler
it
became
evident
that
there
was
at
least
in
the
old
story
concerning
the
dagger
and
i
found
everyone
in
a
half
belief
that
the
queer
old
weapon
did
really
strike
the
butler
either
by
the
aid
of
some
inherent
force
which
i
found
them
peculiarly
unable
to
explain
or
else
in
the
hand
of
some
invisible
thing
or
monster
of
the
outer
world
from
considerable
experience
i
knew
that
it
was
much
more
likely
that
the
butler
had
been
by
some
vicious
and
quite
material
human
naturally
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
test
this
probability
of
human
agency
and
i
set
to
work
to
make
a
pretty
drastic
examination
of
the
people
who
knew
most
about
the
tragedy
the
result
of
this
examination
both
pleased
and
surprised
me
for
it
left
me
with
very
good
reasons
for
belief
that
i
had
come
upon
one
of
those
extraordinary
rare
manifestations
of
the
extrusion
of
a
force
from
the
outside
in
more
popular
phraseology
a
genuine
case
of
haunting
these
are
the
facts
on
the
previous
sunday
evening
but
one
sir
alfred
jarnock
household
had
attended
family
service
as
usual
in
the
chapel
you
see
the
rector
goes
over
to
officiate
twice
each
sunday
after
concluding
his
duties
at
the
public
church
about
three
miles
away
at
the
end
of
the
service
in
the
chapel
sir
alfred
jarnock
his
son
george
jarnock
and
the
rector
had
stood
for
a
couple
of
minutes
talking
whilst
old
bellett
the
butler
went
putting
out
the
candles
suddenly
the
rector
remembered
that
he
had
left
his
small
prayer
book
on
the
communion
table
in
the
morning
he
turned
and
asked
the
butler
to
get
it
for
him
before
he
blew
out
the
chancel
candles
now
i
have
particularly
called
your
attention
to
this
because
it
is
important
in
that
it
provides
witnesses
in
a
most
fortunate
manner
at
an
extraordinary
moment
you
see
the
rector
turning
to
speak
to
bellett
had
naturally
caused
both
sir
alfred
jarnock
and
his
son
to
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
butler
and
it
was
at
this
identical
instant
and
whilst
all
three
were
looking
at
him
that
the
old
butler
was
stabbed
there
full
in
the
candlelight
before
their
eyes
i
took
the
opportunity
to
call
early
upon
the
rector
after
i
had
questioned
george
jarnock
who
replied
to
my
queries
in
place
of
sir
alfred
jarnock
for
the
older
man
was
in
a
nervous
and
shaken
condition
as
a
result
of
the
happening
and
his
son
wished
him
to
avoid
dwelling
upon
the
scene
as
much
as
possible
the
rector
version
was
clear
and
vivid
and
he
had
evidently
received
the
astonishment
of
his
life
he
pictured
to
me
the
whole
affair
bellett
up
at
the
chancel
gate
going
for
the
prayer
book
and
absolutely
alone
and
then
the
out
of
the
void
he
described
it
and
the
prodigious
the
old
man
being
driven
headlong
into
the
body
of
the
chapel
like
the
kick
of
a
great
horse
the
rector
said
his
benevolent
old
eyes
bright
and
intense
with
the
effort
he
had
actually
witnessed
in
defiance
of
all
that
he
had
hitherto
believed
when
i
left
him
he
went
back
to
the
writing
which
he
had
put
aside
when
i
appeared
i
feel
sure
that
he
was
developing
the
first
unorthodox
sermon
that
he
had
ever
evolved
he
was
a
dear
old
chap
and
i
should
certainly
like
to
have
heard
it
the
last
man
i
visited
was
the
butler
he
was
of
course
in
a
frightfully
weak
and
shaken
condition
but
he
could
tell
me
nothing
that
did
not
point
to
there
being
a
power
abroad
in
the
chapel
he
told
the
same
tale
in
every
minute
particle
that
i
had
learned
from
the
others
he
had
been
just
going
up
to
put
out
the
altar
candles
and
fetch
the
rector
book
when
something
struck
him
an
enormous
blow
high
up
on
the
left
breast
and
he
was
driven
headlong
into
the
aisle
examination
had
shown
that
he
had
been
stabbed
by
the
dagger
of
which
i
will
tell
you
more
in
a
moment
that
hung
always
above
the
altar
the
weapon
had
entered
fortunately
some
inches
above
the
heart
just
under
the
collarbone
which
had
been
broken
by
the
stupendous
force
of
the
blow
the
dagger
itself
being
driven
clean
through
the
body
and
out
through
the
scapula
behind
the
poor
old
fellow
could
not
talk
much
and
i
soon
left
him
but
what
he
had
told
me
was
sufficient
to
make
it
unmistakable
that
no
living
person
had
been
within
yards
of
him
when
he
was
attacked
and
as
i
knew
this
fact
was
verified
by
three
capable
and
responsible
witnesses
independent
of
bellett
himself
the
thing
now
was
to
search
the
chapel
which
is
small
and
extremely
old
it
is
very
massively
built
and
entered
through
only
one
door
which
leads
out
of
the
castle
itself
and
the
key
of
which
is
kept
by
sir
alfred
jarnock
the
butler
having
no
duplicate
the
shape
of
the
chapel
is
oblong
and
the
altar
is
railed
off
after
the
usual
fashion
there
are
two
tombs
in
the
body
of
the
place
but
none
in
the
chancel
which
is
bare
except
for
the
tall
candlesticks
and
the
chancel
rail
beyond
which
is
the
undraped
altar
of
solid
marble
upon
which
stand
four
small
candlesticks
two
at
each
end
above
the
altar
hangs
the
dagger
as
i
had
learned
it
was
named
i
fancy
the
term
has
been
taken
from
an
old
vellum
which
describes
the
dagger
and
its
supposed
abnormal
properties
i
took
the
dagger
down
and
examined
it
minutely
and
with
method
the
blade
is
ten
inches
long
two
inches
broad
at
the
base
and
tapering
to
a
rounded
but
sharp
point
rather
peculiar
it
is
the
metal
sheath
is
curious
for
having
a
crosspiece
which
taken
with
the
fact
that
the
sheath
itself
is
continued
three
parts
up
the
hilt
of
the
dagger
in
a
most
inconvenient
fashion
gives
it
the
appearance
of
a
cross
that
this
is
not
unintentional
is
shown
by
an
engraving
of
the
christ
crucified
upon
one
side
whilst
upon
the
other
in
latin
is
the
inscription
is
mine
i
will
repay
a
quaint
and
rather
terrible
conjunction
of
ideas
upon
the
blade
of
the
dagger
is
graven
in
old
english
capitals
i
watch
i
strike
on
the
butt
of
the
hilt
there
is
carved
deeply
a
pentacle
this
is
a
pretty
accurate
description
of
the
peculiar
old
weapon
that
has
had
the
curious
and
uncomfortable
reputation
of
being
able
either
of
its
own
accord
or
in
the
hand
of
something
invisible
to
strike
murderously
any
enemy
of
the
jarnock
family
who
may
chance
to
enter
the
chapel
after
nightfall
i
may
tell
you
here
and
now
that
before
i
left
i
had
very
good
reason
to
put
certain
doubts
behind
me
for
i
tested
the
deadliness
of
the
thing
myself
as
you
know
however
at
this
point
of
my
investigation
i
was
still
at
that
stage
where
i
considered
the
existence
of
a
supernatural
force
unproven
in
the
meanwhile
i
treated
the
chapel
drastically
sounding
and
scrutinizing
the
walls
and
floor
dealing
with
them
almost
foot
by
foot
and
particularly
examining
the
two
tombs
at
the
end
of
this
search
i
had
in
a
ladder
and
made
a
close
survey
of
the
groined
roof
i
passed
three
days
in
this
fashion
and
by
the
evening
of
the
third
day
i
had
proved
to
my
entire
satisfaction
that
there
is
no
place
in
the
whole
of
that
chapel
where
any
living
being
could
have
hidden
and
also
that
the
only
way
of
ingress
and
egress
to
and
from
the
chapel
is
through
the
doorway
which
leads
into
the
castle
the
door
of
which
was
always
kept
locked
and
the
key
kept
by
sir
alfred
jarnock
himself
as
i
have
told
you
i
mean
of
course
that
this
doorway
is
the
only
entrance
practicable
to
material
people
yes
as
you
will
see
even
had
i
discovered
some
other
opening
secret
or
otherwise
it
would
not
have
helped
at
all
to
explain
the
mystery
of
the
incredible
attack
in
a
normal
fashion
for
the
butler
as
you
know
was
struck
in
full
sight
of
the
rector
sir
jarnock
and
his
son
and
old
bellett
himself
knew
that
no
living
person
had
touched
him
of
the
void
the
rector
had
described
the
inhumanly
brutal
attack
of
the
void
a
strange
feeling
it
gives
one
eh
and
this
is
the
thing
that
i
had
been
called
in
to
bottom
after
considerable
thought
i
decided
on
a
plan
of
action
i
proposed
to
sir
alfred
jarnock
that
i
should
spend
a
night
in
the
chapel
and
keep
a
constant
watch
upon
the
dagger
but
to
this
the
old
knight
a
little
wizened
nervous
man
would
not
listen
for
a
moment
he
at
least
i
felt
assured
had
no
doubt
of
the
reality
of
some
dangerous
supernatural
force
a
roam
at
night
in
the
chapel
he
informed
me
that
it
had
been
his
habit
every
evening
to
lock
the
chapel
door
so
that
no
one
might
foolishly
or
heedlessly
run
the
risk
of
any
peril
that
it
might
hold
at
night
and
that
he
could
not
allow
me
to
attempt
such
a
thing
after
what
had
happened
to
the
butler
i
could
see
that
sir
alfred
jarnock
was
very
much
in
earnest
and
would
evidently
have
held
himself
to
blame
had
he
allowed
me
to
make
the
experiment
and
any
harm
come
to
me
so
i
said
nothing
in
argument
and
presently
pleading
the
fatigue
of
his
years
and
health
he
said
goodnight
and
left
me
having
given
me
the
impression
of
being
a
polite
but
rather
superstitious
old
gentleman
that
night
however
whilst
i
was
undressing
i
saw
how
i
might
achieve
the
thing
i
wished
and
be
able
to
enter
the
chapel
after
dark
without
making
sir
alfred
jarnock
nervous
on
the
morrow
when
i
borrowed
the
key
i
would
take
an
impression
and
have
a
duplicate
made
then
with
my
private
key
i
could
do
just
what
i
liked
in
the
morning
i
carried
out
my
idea
i
borrowed
the
key
as
i
wanted
to
take
a
photograph
of
the
chancel
by
daylight
when
i
had
done
this
i
locked
up
the
chapel
and
handed
the
key
to
sir
alfred
jarnock
having
first
taken
an
impression
in
soap
i
had
brought
out
the
exposed
plate
in
its
slide
with
me
but
the
camera
i
had
left
exactly
as
it
was
as
i
wanted
to
take
a
second
photograph
of
the
chancel
that
night
from
the
same
position
i
took
the
dark
slide
into
burtontree
also
the
cake
of
soap
with
the
impress
the
soap
i
left
with
the
local
ironmonger
who
was
something
of
a
locksmith
and
promised
to
let
me
have
my
duplicate
finished
if
i
would
call
in
two
hours
this
i
did
having
in
the
meanwhile
found
out
a
photographer
where
i
developed
the
plate
and
left
it
to
dry
telling
him
i
would
call
next
day
at
the
end
of
the
two
hours
i
went
for
my
key
and
found
it
ready
much
to
my
satisfaction
then
i
returned
to
the
castle
after
dinner
that
evening
i
played
billiards
with
young
jarnock
for
a
couple
of
hours
then
i
had
a
cup
of
coffee
and
went
off
to
my
room
telling
him
i
was
feeling
awfully
tired
he
nodded
and
told
me
he
felt
the
same
way
i
was
glad
for
i
wanted
the
house
to
settle
as
soon
as
possible
i
locked
the
door
of
my
room
then
from
under
the
bed
where
i
had
hidden
them
earlier
in
the
evening
i
drew
out
several
fine
pieces
of
plate
armor
which
i
had
removed
from
the
armory
there
was
also
a
shirt
of
chain
mail
with
a
sort
of
quilted
hood
of
mail
to
go
over
the
head
i
buckled
on
the
plate
armor
and
found
it
extraordinarily
uncomfortable
and
over
all
i
drew
on
the
chain
mail
i
know
nothing
about
armor
but
from
what
i
have
learned
since
i
must
have
put
on
parts
of
two
suits
anyway
i
felt
beastly
clamped
and
clumsy
and
unable
to
move
my
arms
and
legs
naturally
but
i
knew
that
the
thing
i
was
thinking
of
doing
called
for
some
sort
of
protection
for
my
body
over
the
armor
i
pulled
on
my
dressing
gown
and
shoved
my
revolver
into
one
of
the
side
pockets
and
my
repeating
into
the
other
my
dark
lantern
i
carried
in
my
hand
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
i
went
out
into
the
passage
and
listened
i
had
been
some
considerable
time
making
my
preparations
and
i
found
that
now
the
big
hall
and
staircase
were
in
darkness
and
all
the
house
seemed
quiet
i
stepped
back
and
closed
and
locked
my
door
then
very
slowly
and
silently
i
went
downstairs
to
the
hall
and
turned
into
the
passage
that
led
to
the
chapel
i
reached
the
door
and
tried
my
key
it
fitted
perfectly
and
a
moment
later
i
was
in
the
chapel
with
the
door
locked
behind
me
and
all
about
me
the
utter
dree
silence
of
the
place
with
just
the
faint
showings
of
the
outlines
of
the
stained
leaded
windows
making
the
darkness
and
lonesomeness
almost
the
more
apparent
now
it
would
be
silly
to
say
i
did
not
feel
queer
i
felt
very
queer
indeed
you
just
try
any
of
you
to
imagine
yourself
standing
there
in
the
dark
silence
and
remembering
not
only
the
legend
that
was
attached
to
the
place
but
what
had
really
happened
to
the
old
butler
only
a
little
while
gone
i
can
tell
you
as
i
stood
there
i
could
believe
that
something
invisible
was
coming
toward
me
in
the
air
of
the
chapel
yet
i
had
got
to
go
through
with
the
business
and
i
just
took
hold
of
my
little
bit
of
courage
and
set
to
work
first
of
all
i
switched
on
my
light
then
i
began
a
careful
tour
of
the
place
examining
every
corner
and
nook
i
found
nothing
unusual
at
the
chancel
gate
i
held
up
my
lamp
and
flashed
the
light
at
the
dagger
it
hung
there
right
enough
above
the
altar
but
i
remember
thinking
of
the
word
as
i
looked
at
it
however
i
pushed
the
thought
away
for
what
i
was
doing
needed
no
addition
of
uncomfortable
thoughts
i
completed
the
tour
of
the
place
with
a
constantly
growing
awareness
of
its
utter
chill
and
unkind
desolation
an
atmosphere
of
cold
dismalness
seemed
to
be
everywhere
and
the
quiet
was
abominable
at
the
conclusion
of
my
search
i
walked
across
to
where
i
had
left
my
camera
focused
upon
the
chancel
from
the
satchel
that
i
had
put
beneath
the
tripod
i
took
out
a
dark
slide
and
inserted
it
in
the
camera
drawing
the
shutter
after
that
i
uncapped
the
lens
pulled
out
my
flashlight
apparatus
and
pressed
the
trigger
there
was
an
intense
brilliant
flash
that
made
the
whole
of
the
interior
of
the
chapel
jump
into
sight
and
disappear
as
quickly
then
in
the
light
from
my
lantern
i
inserted
the
shutter
into
the
slide
and
reversed
the
slide
so
as
to
have
a
fresh
plate
ready
to
expose
at
any
time
after
i
had
done
this
i
shut
off
my
lantern
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
pews
near
to
my
camera
i
can
not
say
what
i
expected
to
happen
but
i
had
an
extraordinary
feeling
almost
a
conviction
that
something
peculiar
or
horrible
would
soon
occur
it
was
you
know
as
if
i
knew
an
hour
passed
of
absolute
silence
the
time
i
knew
by
the
faint
chime
of
a
clock
that
had
been
erected
over
the
stables
i
was
beastly
cold
for
the
whole
place
is
without
any
kind
of
heating
pipes
or
furnace
as
i
had
noticed
during
my
search
so
that
the
temperature
was
sufficiently
uncomfortable
to
suit
my
frame
of
mind
i
felt
like
a
kind
of
human
periwinkle
encased
in
boilerplate
and
frozen
with
cold
and
funk
and
you
know
somehow
the
dark
about
me
seemed
to
press
coldly
against
my
face
i
can
not
say
whether
any
of
you
have
ever
had
the
feeling
but
if
you
have
you
will
know
just
how
disgustingly
unnerving
it
is
and
then
all
at
once
i
had
a
horrible
sense
that
something
was
moving
in
the
place
it
was
not
that
i
could
hear
anything
but
i
had
a
kind
of
intuitive
knowledge
that
something
had
stirred
in
the
darkness
can
you
imagine
how
i
felt
suddenly
my
courage
went
i
put
up
my
mailed
arms
over
my
face
i
wanted
to
protect
it
i
had
got
a
sudden
sickening
feeling
that
something
was
hovering
over
me
in
the
dark
talk
about
fright
i
could
have
shouted
if
i
had
not
been
afraid
of
the
noise
and
then
abruptly
i
heard
something
away
up
the
aisle
there
sounded
a
dull
clang
of
metal
as
it
might
be
the
tread
of
a
mailed
heel
upon
the
stone
of
the
aisle
i
sat
immovable
i
was
fighting
with
all
my
strength
to
get
back
my
courage
i
could
not
take
my
arms
down
from
over
my
face
but
i
knew
that
i
was
getting
hold
of
the
gritty
part
of
me
again
and
suddenly
i
made
a
mighty
effort
and
lowered
my
arms
i
held
my
face
up
in
the
darkness
and
i
tell
you
i
respect
myself
for
the
act
because
i
thought
truly
at
that
moment
that
i
was
going
to
die
but
i
think
just
then
by
the
slow
revulsion
of
feeling
which
had
assisted
my
effort
i
was
less
sick
in
that
instant
at
the
thought
of
having
to
die
than
at
the
knowledge
of
the
utter
weak
cowardice
that
had
so
unexpectedly
shaken
me
all
to
bits
for
a
time
do
i
make
myself
clear
you
understand
i
feel
sure
that
the
sense
of
respect
which
i
spoke
of
is
not
really
unhealthy
egotism
because
you
see
i
am
not
blind
to
the
state
of
mind
which
helped
me
i
mean
that
if
i
had
uncovered
my
face
by
a
sheer
effort
of
will
unhelped
by
any
revulsion
of
feeling
i
should
have
done
a
thing
much
more
worthy
of
mention
but
even
as
it
was
there
were
elements
in
the
act
worthy
of
respect
you
follow
me
do
you
and
you
know
nothing
touched
me
after
all
so
that
in
a
little
while
i
had
got
back
a
bit
to
my
normal
and
felt
steady
enough
to
go
through
with
the
business
without
any
more
funking
i
daresay
a
couple
of
minutes
passed
and
then
away
up
near
the
chancel
there
came
again
that
clang
as
though
an
armored
foot
stepped
cautiously
by
jove
but
it
made
me
stiffen
and
suddenly
the
thought
came
that
the
sound
i
heard
might
be
the
rattle
of
the
dagger
above
the
altar
it
was
not
a
particularly
sensible
notion
for
the
sound
was
far
too
heavy
and
resonant
for
such
a
cause
yet
as
can
be
easily
understood
my
reason
was
bound
to
submit
somewhat
to
my
fancy
at
such
a
time
i
remember
now
that
the
idea
of
that
insensate
thing
becoming
animate
and
attacking
me
did
not
occur
to
me
with
any
sense
of
possibility
or
reality
i
thought
rather
in
a
vague
way
of
some
invisible
monster
of
outer
space
fumbling
at
the
dagger
i
remembered
the
old
rector
description
of
the
attack
on
the
butler
the
and
he
had
described
the
stupendous
force
of
the
blow
as
being
the
kick
of
a
great
horse
you
can
see
how
uncomfortably
my
thoughts
were
running
i
felt
swiftly
and
cautiously
for
my
lantern
i
found
it
close
to
me
on
the
pew
seat
and
with
a
sudden
jerky
movement
i
switched
on
the
light
i
flashed
it
up
the
aisle
to
and
fro
across
the
chancel
but
i
could
see
nothing
to
frighten
me
i
turned
quickly
and
sent
the
jet
of
light
darting
across
and
across
the
rear
end
of
the
chapel
then
on
each
side
of
me
before
and
behind
up
at
the
roof
and
down
at
the
marble
floor
but
nowhere
was
there
any
visible
thing
to
put
me
in
fear
not
a
thing
that
need
have
set
my
flesh
thrilling
just
the
quiet
chapel
cold
and
eternally
silent
you
know
the
feeling
i
had
been
standing
whilst
i
sent
the
light
about
the
chapel
but
now
i
pulled
out
my
revolver
and
then
with
a
tremendous
effort
of
will
switched
off
the
light
and
sat
down
again
in
the
darkness
to
continue
my
constant
watch
it
seemed
to
me
that
quite
half
an
hour
or
even
more
must
have
passed
after
this
during
which
no
sound
had
broken
the
intense
stillness
i
had
grown
less
nervously
tense
for
the
flashing
of
the
light
the
place
had
made
me
feel
less
out
of
all
bounds
of
the
normal
it
had
given
me
something
of
that
unreasoned
sense
of
safety
that
a
nervous
child
obtains
at
night
by
covering
its
head
up
with
the
bedclothes
this
just
about
illustrates
the
completely
human
illogicalness
of
the
workings
of
my
feelings
for
as
you
know
whatever
creature
thing
or
being
it
was
that
had
made
that
extraordinary
and
horrible
attack
on
the
old
butler
it
had
certainly
not
been
visible
and
so
you
must
picture
me
sitting
there
in
the
dark
clumsy
with
armor
and
with
my
revolver
in
one
hand
and
nursing
my
lantern
ready
with
the
other
and
then
it
was
after
this
little
time
of
partial
relief
from
intense
nervousness
that
there
came
a
fresh
strain
on
me
for
somewhere
in
the
utter
quiet
of
the
chapel
i
thought
i
heard
something
i
listened
tense
and
rigid
my
heart
booming
just
a
little
in
my
ears
for
a
moment
then
i
thought
i
heard
it
again
i
felt
sure
that
something
had
moved
at
the
top
of
the
aisle
i
strained
in
the
darkness
to
hark
and
my
eyes
showed
me
blackness
within
blackness
wherever
i
glanced
so
that
i
took
no
heed
of
what
they
told
me
for
even
if
i
looked
at
the
dim
loom
of
the
stained
window
at
the
top
of
the
chancel
my
sight
gave
me
the
shapes
of
vague
shadows
passing
noiseless
and
ghostly
across
constantly
there
was
a
time
of
almost
peculiar
silence
horrible
to
me
as
i
felt
just
then
and
suddenly
i
seemed
to
hear
a
sound
again
nearer
to
me
and
repeated
infinitely
stealthy
it
was
as
if
a
vast
soft
tread
were
coming
slowly
down
the
aisle
can
you
imagine
how
i
felt
i
do
not
think
you
can
i
did
not
move
any
more
than
the
stone
effigies
on
the
two
tombs
but
sat
there
i
fancied
now
that
i
heard
the
tread
all
about
the
chapel
and
then
you
know
i
was
just
as
sure
in
a
moment
that
i
could
not
hear
it
that
i
had
never
heard
it
some
particularly
long
minutes
passed
about
this
time
but
i
think
my
nerves
must
have
quieted
a
bit
for
i
remember
being
sufficiently
aware
of
my
feelings
to
realize
that
the
muscles
of
my
shoulders
with
the
way
that
they
must
have
been
contracted
as
i
sat
there
hunching
myself
rigid
mind
you
i
was
still
in
a
disgusting
funk
but
what
i
might
call
the
sense
of
danger
seemed
to
have
eased
from
around
me
at
any
rate
i
felt
in
some
curious
fashion
that
there
was
a
respite
a
temporary
cessation
of
malignity
from
about
me
it
is
impossible
to
word
my
feelings
more
clearly
to
you
for
i
can
not
see
them
more
clearly
than
this
myself
yet
you
must
not
picture
me
as
sitting
there
free
from
strain
for
the
nerve
tension
was
so
great
that
my
heart
action
was
a
little
out
of
normal
control
the
blood
beat
making
a
dull
booming
at
times
in
my
ears
with
the
result
that
i
had
the
sensation
that
i
could
not
hear
acutely
this
is
a
simply
beastly
feeling
especially
under
such
circumstances
i
was
sitting
like
this
listening
as
i
might
say
with
body
and
soul
when
suddenly
i
got
that
hideous
conviction
again
that
something
was
moving
in
the
air
of
the
place
the
feeling
seemed
to
stiffen
me
as
i
sat
and
my
head
appeared
to
tighten
as
if
all
the
scalp
had
grown
this
was
so
real
that
i
suffered
an
actual
pain
most
peculiar
and
at
the
same
time
intense
the
whole
head
pained
i
had
a
fierce
desire
to
cover
my
face
again
with
my
mailed
arms
but
i
fought
it
off
if
i
had
given
way
then
to
that
i
should
simply
have
bunked
straight
out
of
the
place
i
sat
and
sweated
coldly
that
the
bald
truth
with
the
busy
at
my
spine
and
then
abruptly
once
more
i
thought
i
heard
the
sound
of
that
huge
soft
tread
on
the
aisle
and
this
time
closer
to
me
there
was
an
awful
little
silence
during
which
i
had
the
feeling
that
something
enormous
was
bending
over
toward
me
from
the
aisle
and
then
through
the
booming
of
the
blood
in
my
ears
there
came
a
slight
sound
from
the
place
where
my
camera
stood
a
disagreeable
sort
of
slithering
sound
and
then
a
sharp
tap
i
had
the
lantern
ready
in
my
left
hand
and
now
i
snapped
it
on
desperately
and
shone
it
straight
above
me
for
i
had
a
conviction
that
there
was
something
there
but
i
saw
nothing
immediately
i
flashed
the
light
at
the
camera
and
along
the
aisle
but
again
there
was
nothing
visible
i
wheeled
shooting
the
beam
of
light
in
a
great
circle
about
the
place
to
and
fro
i
shone
it
jerking
it
here
and
there
but
it
showed
me
nothing
i
had
stood
up
the
instant
that
i
had
seen
that
there
was
nothing
in
sight
over
me
and
now
i
determined
to
visit
the
chancel
and
see
whether
the
dagger
had
been
touched
i
stepped
out
of
the
pew
into
the
aisle
and
here
i
came
to
an
abrupt
pause
for
an
almost
invincible
sick
repugnance
was
fighting
me
back
from
the
upper
part
of
the
chapel
a
constant
queer
prickling
went
up
and
down
my
spine
and
a
dull
ache
took
me
in
the
small
of
the
back
as
i
fought
with
myself
to
conquer
this
sudden
new
feeling
of
terror
and
horror
i
tell
you
that
no
one
who
has
not
been
through
these
kinds
of
experiences
has
any
idea
of
the
sheer
actual
physical
pain
attendant
upon
and
resulting
from
the
intense
nerve
strain
that
ghostly
fright
sets
up
in
the
human
system
i
stood
there
feeling
positively
ill
but
i
got
myself
in
hand
as
it
were
in
about
half
a
minute
and
then
i
went
walking
i
expect
as
jerky
as
a
mechanical
tin
man
and
switching
the
light
from
side
to
side
before
and
behind
and
over
my
head
continually
and
the
hand
that
held
my
revolver
sweated
so
much
that
the
thing
fairly
slipped
in
my
fist
does
not
sound
very
heroic
does
it
i
passed
through
the
short
chancel
and
reached
the
step
that
led
up
to
the
small
gate
in
the
chancel
rail
i
threw
the
beam
from
my
lantern
upon
the
dagger
yes
i
thought
it
all
right
abruptly
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
something
wanting
and
i
leaned
forward
over
the
chancel
gate
to
peer
holding
the
light
high
my
suspicion
was
hideously
correct
dagger
had
only
the
sheath
hung
there
above
the
altar
in
a
sudden
frightened
flash
of
imagination
i
pictured
the
thing
adrift
in
the
chapel
moving
here
and
there
as
though
of
its
own
volition
for
whatever
force
wielded
it
was
certainly
beyond
visibility
i
turned
my
head
stiffly
over
to
the
left
glancing
frightenedly
behind
me
and
flashing
the
light
to
help
my
eyes
in
the
same
instant
i
was
struck
a
tremendous
blow
over
the
left
breast
and
hurled
backward
from
the
chancel
rail
into
the
aisle
my
armor
clanging
loudly
in
the
horrible
silence
i
landed
on
my
back
and
slithered
along
on
the
polished
marble
my
shoulder
struck
the
corner
of
a
pew
front
and
brought
me
up
half
stunned
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
horribly
sick
and
shaken
but
the
fear
that
was
on
me
making
little
of
that
at
the
moment
i
was
minus
both
revolver
and
lantern
and
utterly
bewildered
as
to
just
where
i
was
standing
i
bowed
my
head
and
made
a
scrambling
run
in
the
complete
darkness
and
dashed
into
a
pew
i
jumped
back
staggering
got
my
bearings
a
little
and
raced
down
the
center
of
the
aisle
putting
my
mailed
arms
over
my
face
i
plunged
into
my
camera
hurling
it
among
the
pews
i
crashed
into
the
font
and
reeled
back
then
i
was
at
the
exit
i
fumbled
madly
in
my
dressing
gown
pocket
for
the
key
i
found
it
and
scraped
at
the
door
feverishly
for
the
keyhole
i
found
the
keyhole
turned
the
key
burst
the
door
open
and
was
into
the
passage
i
slammed
the
door
and
leant
hard
against
it
gasping
whilst
i
felt
crazily
again
for
the
keyhole
this
time
to
lock
the
door
upon
what
was
in
the
chapel
i
succeeded
and
began
to
feel
my
way
stupidly
along
the
wall
of
the
corridor
presently
i
had
come
to
the
big
hall
and
so
in
a
little
to
my
room
in
my
room
i
sat
for
a
while
until
i
had
steadied
down
something
to
the
normal
after
a
time
i
commenced
to
strip
off
the
armor
i
saw
then
that
both
the
chain
mail
and
the
plate
armor
had
been
pierced
over
the
breast
and
suddenly
it
came
home
to
me
that
the
thing
had
struck
for
my
heart
stripping
rapidly
i
found
that
the
skin
of
the
breast
over
the
heart
had
just
been
cut
sufficiently
to
allow
a
little
blood
to
stain
my
shirt
nothing
more
only
the
whole
breast
was
badly
bruised
and
intensely
painful
you
can
imagine
what
would
have
happened
if
i
had
not
worn
the
armor
in
any
case
it
is
a
marvel
that
i
was
not
knocked
senseless
i
did
not
go
to
bed
at
all
that
night
but
sat
upon
the
edge
thinking
and
waiting
for
the
dawn
for
i
had
to
remove
my
litter
before
sir
alfred
jarnock
should
enter
if
i
were
to
hide
from
him
the
fact
that
i
had
managed
a
duplicate
key
so
soon
as
the
pale
light
of
the
morning
had
strengthened
sufficiently
to
show
me
the
various
details
of
my
room
i
made
my
way
quietly
down
to
the
chapel
very
silently
and
with
tense
nerves
i
opened
the
door
the
chill
light
of
the
dawn
made
distinct
the
whole
place
everything
seeming
instinct
with
a
ghostly
unearthly
quiet
can
you
get
the
feeling
i
waited
several
minutes
at
the
door
allowing
the
morning
to
grow
and
likewise
my
courage
i
suppose
presently
the
rising
sun
threw
an
odd
beam
right
in
through
the
big
east
window
making
colored
sunshine
all
the
length
of
the
chapel
and
then
with
a
tremendous
effort
i
forced
myself
to
enter
i
went
up
the
aisle
to
where
i
had
overthrown
my
camera
in
the
darkness
the
legs
of
the
tripod
were
sticking
up
from
the
interior
of
a
pew
and
i
expected
to
find
the
machine
smashed
to
pieces
yet
beyond
that
the
ground
glass
was
broken
there
was
no
real
damage
done
i
replaced
the
camera
in
the
position
from
which
i
had
taken
the
previous
photography
but
the
slide
containing
the
plate
i
had
exposed
by
flashlight
i
removed
and
put
into
one
of
my
side
pockets
regretting
that
i
had
not
taken
a
second
flash
picture
at
the
instant
when
i
heard
those
strange
sounds
up
in
the
chancel
having
tidied
my
photographic
apparatus
i
went
to
the
chancel
to
recover
my
lantern
and
revolver
which
had
both
as
you
know
been
knocked
from
my
hands
when
i
was
stabbed
i
found
the
lantern
lying
hopelessly
bent
with
smashed
lens
just
under
the
pulpit
my
revolver
i
must
have
held
until
my
shoulder
struck
the
pew
for
it
was
lying
there
in
the
aisle
just
about
where
i
believe
i
cannoned
into
the
pew
corner
it
was
quite
undamaged
having
secured
these
two
articles
i
walked
up
to
the
chancel
rail
to
see
whether
the
dagger
had
returned
or
been
returned
to
its
sheath
above
the
altar
before
however
i
reached
the
chancel
rail
i
had
a
slight
shock
for
there
on
the
floor
of
the
chancel
about
a
yard
away
from
where
i
had
been
struck
lay
the
dagger
quiet
and
demure
upon
the
polished
marble
pavement
i
wonder
whether
you
will
any
of
you
understand
the
nervousness
that
took
me
at
the
sight
of
the
thing
with
a
sudden
unreasoned
action
i
jumped
forward
and
put
my
foot
on
it
to
hold
it
there
can
you
understand
do
you
and
you
know
i
could
not
stoop
down
and
pick
it
up
with
my
hands
for
quite
a
minute
i
should
think
afterward
when
i
had
done
so
however
and
handled
it
a
little
this
feeling
passed
away
and
my
reason
and
also
i
expect
the
daylight
made
me
feel
that
i
had
been
a
little
bit
of
an
ass
quite
natural
though
i
assure
you
yet
it
was
a
new
kind
of
fear
to
me
i
taking
no
notice
of
the
cheap
joke
about
the
ass
i
am
talking
about
the
curiousness
of
learning
in
that
moment
a
new
shade
or
quality
of
fear
that
had
hitherto
been
outside
of
my
knowledge
or
imagination
does
it
interest
you
i
examined
the
dagger
minutely
turning
it
over
and
over
in
my
hands
and
never
as
i
suddenly
discovered
holding
it
loosely
it
was
as
if
i
were
subconsciously
surprised
that
it
lay
quiet
in
my
hands
yet
even
this
feeling
passed
largely
after
a
short
while
the
curious
weapon
showed
no
signs
of
the
blow
except
that
the
dull
color
of
the
blade
was
slightly
brighter
on
the
rounded
point
that
had
cut
through
the
armor
presently
when
i
had
made
an
end
of
staring
at
the
dagger
i
went
up
the
chancel
step
and
in
through
the
little
gate
then
kneeling
upon
the
altar
i
replaced
the
dagger
in
its
sheath
and
came
outside
of
the
rail
again
closing
the
gate
after
me
and
feeling
awarely
uncomfortable
because
the
horrible
old
weapon
was
back
again
in
its
accustomed
place
i
suppose
without
analyzing
my
feelings
very
deeply
i
had
an
unreasoned
and
only
belief
that
there
was
a
greater
probability
of
danger
when
the
dagger
hung
in
its
five
century
resting
place
than
when
it
was
out
of
it
yet
somehow
i
do
think
this
is
a
very
good
explanation
when
i
remember
the
look
the
thing
seemed
to
have
when
i
saw
it
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
chancel
only
i
know
this
that
when
i
had
replaced
the
dagger
i
had
quite
a
touch
of
nerves
and
i
stopped
only
to
pick
up
my
lantern
from
where
i
had
placed
it
whilst
i
examined
the
weapon
after
which
i
went
down
the
quiet
aisle
at
a
pretty
quick
walk
and
so
got
out
of
the
place
that
the
nerve
tension
had
been
considerable
i
realized
when
i
had
locked
the
door
behind
me
i
felt
no
inclination
now
to
think
of
old
sir
alfred
as
a
hypochondriac
because
he
had
taken
such
hyperseeming
precautions
regarding
the
chapel
i
had
a
sudden
wonder
as
to
whether
he
might
not
have
some
knowledge
of
a
long
prior
tragedy
in
which
the
dagger
had
been
concerned
i
returned
to
my
room
washed
shaved
and
dressed
after
which
i
read
awhile
then
i
went
downstairs
and
got
the
acting
butler
to
give
me
some
sandwiches
and
a
cup
of
coffee
half
an
hour
later
i
was
heading
for
burtontree
as
hard
as
i
could
walk
for
a
sudden
idea
had
come
to
me
which
i
was
anxious
to
test
i
reached
the
town
a
little
before
eight
thirty
and
found
the
local
photographer
with
his
shutters
still
up
i
did
not
wait
but
knocked
until
he
appeared
with
his
coat
off
evidently
in
the
act
of
dealing
with
his
breakfast
in
a
few
words
i
made
clear
that
i
wanted
the
use
of
his
dark
room
immediately
and
this
he
at
once
placed
at
my
disposal
i
had
brought
with
me
the
slide
which
contained
the
plate
that
i
had
used
with
the
flashlight
and
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
i
set
to
work
to
develop
yet
it
was
not
the
plate
which
i
had
exposed
that
i
first
put
into
the
solution
but
the
second
plate
which
had
been
ready
in
the
camera
during
all
the
time
of
my
waiting
in
the
darkness
you
see
the
lens
had
been
uncapped
all
that
while
so
that
the
whole
chancel
had
been
as
it
were
under
observation
you
all
know
something
of
my
experiments
in
photography
that
is
appreciating
light
it
was
work
that
started
me
in
that
direction
yet
you
must
understand
though
i
was
attempting
to
develop
this
plate
i
had
no
definite
idea
of
results
nothing
more
than
a
vague
hope
that
it
might
show
me
something
yet
because
of
the
possibilities
it
was
with
the
most
intense
and
absorbing
interest
that
i
watched
the
plate
under
the
action
of
the
developer
presently
i
saw
a
faint
smudge
of
black
appear
in
the
upper
part
and
after
that
others
indistinct
and
wavering
of
outline
i
held
the
negative
up
to
the
light
the
marks
were
rather
small
and
were
almost
entirely
confined
to
one
end
of
the
plate
but
as
i
have
said
lacked
definiteness
yet
such
as
they
were
they
were
sufficient
to
make
me
very
excited
and
i
shoved
the
thing
quickly
back
into
the
solution
for
some
minutes
further
i
watched
it
lifting
it
out
once
or
twice
to
make
a
more
exact
scrutiny
but
could
not
imagine
what
the
markings
might
represent
until
suddenly
it
occurred
to
me
that
in
one
of
two
places
they
certainly
had
shapes
suggestive
of
a
cross
hilted
dagger
yet
the
shapes
were
sufficiently
indefinite
to
make
me
careful
not
to
let
myself
be
overimpressed
by
the
uncomfortable
resemblance
though
i
must
confess
the
very
thought
was
sufficient
to
set
some
odd
thrills
adrift
in
me
i
carried
development
a
little
further
then
put
the
negative
into
the
hypo
and
commenced
work
upon
the
other
plate
this
came
up
nicely
and
very
soon
i
had
a
really
decent
negative
that
appeared
similar
in
every
respect
except
for
the
difference
of
lighting
to
the
negative
i
had
taken
during
the
previous
day
i
fixed
the
plate
then
having
washed
both
it
and
the
one
for
a
few
minutes
under
the
tap
i
put
them
into
methylated
spirits
for
fifteen
minutes
after
which
i
carried
them
into
the
photographer
kitchen
and
dried
them
in
the
oven
whilst
the
two
plates
were
drying
the
photographer
and
i
made
an
enlargement
from
the
negative
i
had
taken
by
daylight
then
we
did
the
same
with
the
two
that
i
had
just
developed
washing
them
as
quickly
as
possible
for
i
was
not
troubling
about
the
permanency
of
the
prints
and
drying
them
with
spirits
when
this
was
done
i
took
them
to
the
window
and
made
a
thorough
examination
commencing
with
the
one
that
appeared
to
show
shadowy
daggers
in
several
places
yet
though
it
was
now
enlarged
i
was
still
unable
to
feel
convinced
that
the
marks
truly
represented
anything
abnormal
and
because
of
this
i
put
it
on
one
side
determined
not
to
let
my
imagination
play
too
large
a
part
in
constructing
weapons
out
of
the
indefinite
outlines
i
took
up
the
two
other
enlargements
both
of
the
chancel
as
you
will
remember
and
commenced
to
compare
them
for
some
minutes
i
examined
them
without
being
able
to
distinguish
any
difference
in
the
scene
they
portrayed
and
then
abruptly
i
saw
something
in
which
they
varied
in
the
second
enlargement
the
one
made
from
the
flashlight
negative
the
dagger
was
not
in
its
sheath
yet
i
had
felt
sure
it
was
there
but
a
few
minutes
before
i
took
the
photograph
after
this
discovery
i
began
to
compare
the
two
enlargements
in
a
very
different
manner
from
my
previous
scrutiny
i
borrowed
a
pair
of
calipers
from
the
photographer
and
with
these
i
carried
out
a
most
methodical
and
exact
comparison
of
the
details
shown
in
the
two
photographs
suddenly
i
came
upon
something
that
set
me
all
tingling
with
excitement
i
threw
the
calipers
down
paid
the
photographer
and
walked
out
through
the
shop
into
the
street
the
three
enlargements
i
took
with
me
making
them
into
a
roll
as
i
went
at
the
corner
of
the
street
i
had
the
luck
to
get
a
cab
and
was
soon
back
at
the
castle
i
hurried
up
to
my
room
and
put
the
photographs
away
then
i
went
down
to
see
whether
i
could
find
sir
alfred
jarnock
but
george
jarnock
who
met
me
told
me
that
his
father
was
too
unwell
to
rise
and
would
prefer
that
no
one
entered
the
chapel
unless
he
were
about
young
jarnock
made
a
half
apologetic
excuse
for
his
father
remarking
that
sir
alfred
jarnock
was
perhaps
inclined
to
be
a
little
over
careful
but
that
considering
what
had
happened
we
must
agree
that
the
need
for
his
carefulness
had
been
justified
he
added
also
that
even
before
the
horrible
attack
on
the
butler
his
father
had
been
just
as
particular
always
keeping
the
key
and
never
allowing
the
door
to
be
unlocked
except
when
the
place
was
in
use
for
divine
service
and
for
an
hour
each
forenoon
when
the
cleaners
were
in
to
all
this
i
nodded
understandingly
but
when
presently
the
young
man
left
me
i
took
my
duplicate
key
and
made
for
the
door
of
the
chapel
i
went
in
and
locked
it
behind
me
after
which
i
carried
out
some
intensely
interesting
and
rather
weird
experiments
these
proved
successful
to
such
an
extent
that
i
came
out
of
the
place
in
a
perfect
fever
of
excitement
i
inquired
for
george
jarnock
and
was
told
that
he
was
in
the
morning
room
along
i
said
when
i
had
found
him
give
me
a
lift
something
exceedingly
strange
to
show
you
he
was
palpably
very
much
puzzled
but
came
quickly
as
we
strode
along
he
asked
me
a
score
of
questions
to
all
of
which
i
just
shook
my
head
asking
him
to
wait
a
little
i
led
the
way
to
the
armory
here
i
suggested
that
he
should
take
one
side
of
a
dummy
dressed
in
half
plate
armor
whilst
i
took
the
other
he
nodded
though
obviously
vastly
bewildered
and
together
we
carried
the
thing
to
the
chapel
door
when
he
saw
me
take
out
my
key
and
open
the
way
for
us
he
appeared
even
more
astonished
but
held
himself
in
evidently
waiting
for
me
to
explain
we
entered
the
chapel
and
i
locked
the
door
behind
us
after
which
we
carted
the
armored
dummy
up
the
aisle
to
the
gate
of
the
chancel
rail
where
we
put
it
down
upon
its
round
wooden
stand
back
i
shouted
suddenly
as
young
jarnock
made
a
movement
to
open
the
gate
god
man
you
must
do
that
do
what
he
asked
and
by
my
words
and
manner
one
minute
i
said
just
stand
to
the
side
a
moment
and
watch
he
stepped
to
the
left
whilst
i
took
the
dummy
in
my
arms
and
turned
it
to
face
the
altar
so
that
it
stood
close
to
the
gate
then
standing
well
away
on
the
right
side
i
pressed
the
back
of
the
thing
so
that
it
leant
forward
a
little
upon
the
gate
which
flew
open
in
the
same
instant
the
dummy
was
struck
a
tremendous
blow
that
hurled
it
into
the
aisle
the
armor
rattling
and
clanging
upon
the
polished
marble
floor
good
god
shouted
young
jarnock
and
ran
back
from
the
chancel
rail
his
face
very
white
come
and
look
at
the
thing
i
said
and
led
the
way
to
where
the
dummy
lay
its
armored
upper
limbs
all
splayed
adrift
in
queer
contortions
i
stooped
over
it
and
pointed
there
driven
right
through
the
thick
steel
breastplate
was
the
dagger
good
god
said
young
jarnock
again
good
god
it
the
dagger
the
thing
been
stabbed
same
as
bellett
yes
i
replied
and
saw
him
glance
swiftly
toward
the
entrance
of
the
chapel
but
i
will
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
never
budged
an
inch
come
and
see
how
it
was
done
i
said
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
chancel
rail
from
the
wall
to
the
left
of
the
altar
i
took
down
a
long
curiously
ornamented
iron
instrument
not
unlike
a
short
spear
the
sharp
end
of
this
i
inserted
in
a
hole
in
the
gatepost
of
the
chancel
gateway
i
lifted
hard
and
a
section
of
the
post
from
the
floor
upward
bent
inward
toward
the
altar
as
though
hinged
at
the
bottom
down
it
went
leaving
the
remaining
part
of
the
post
standing
as
i
bent
the
movable
portion
lower
there
came
a
quick
click
and
a
section
of
the
floor
slid
to
one
side
showing
a
long
shallow
cavity
sufficient
to
enclose
the
post
i
put
my
weight
to
the
lever
and
hove
the
post
down
into
the
niche
immediately
there
was
a
sharp
clang
as
some
catch
snicked
in
and
held
it
against
the
powerful
operating
spring
i
went
over
now
to
the
dummy
and
after
a
few
minute
work
managed
to
wrench
the
dagger
loose
out
of
the
armor
i
brought
the
old
weapon
and
placed
its
hilt
in
a
hole
near
the
top
of
the
post
where
it
fitted
loosely
the
point
upward
after
that
i
went
again
to
the
lever
and
gave
another
strong
heave
and
the
post
descended
about
a
foot
to
the
bottom
of
the
cavity
catching
there
with
another
clang
i
withdrew
the
lever
and
the
narrow
strip
of
floor
slid
back
covering
post
and
dagger
and
looking
no
different
from
the
surrounding
surface
then
i
shut
the
chancel
gate
and
we
both
stood
well
to
one
side
i
took
the
lever
and
gave
the
gate
a
little
push
so
that
it
opened
instantly
there
was
a
loud
thud
and
something
sang
through
the
air
striking
the
bottom
wall
of
the
chapel
it
was
the
dagger
i
showed
jarnock
then
that
the
other
half
of
the
post
had
sprung
back
into
place
making
the
whole
post
as
thick
as
the
one
upon
the
side
of
the
gate
there
i
said
turning
to
the
young
man
and
tapping
the
divided
post
there
the
thing
that
used
the
dagger
but
who
the
deuce
is
the
person
who
sets
the
trap
i
looked
at
him
keenly
as
i
spoke
my
father
is
the
only
one
who
has
a
key
he
said
so
it
practically
impossible
for
anyone
to
get
in
and
meddle
i
looked
at
him
again
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
not
yet
reached
out
to
any
conclusion
see
here
jarnock
i
said
perhaps
rather
curter
than
i
should
have
done
considering
what
i
had
to
say
are
you
quite
sure
that
sir
alfred
is
quite
balanced
mentally
he
looked
at
me
half
frightenedly
and
flushing
a
little
i
realized
then
how
badly
i
put
it
i
do
know
he
replied
after
a
slight
pause
and
was
then
silent
except
for
one
or
two
incoherent
half
remarks
the
truth
i
said
you
suspected
something
now
and
again
you
need
be
afraid
to
tell
me
he
answered
slowly
admit
i
thought
father
a
little
a
little
strange
perhaps
at
times
but
i
always
tried
to
think
i
was
mistaken
i
always
hoped
no
one
else
would
see
it
you
see
i
very
fond
of
the
old
guvnor
i
nodded
right
too
i
said
not
the
least
need
to
make
any
kind
of
scandal
about
this
we
must
do
something
though
but
in
a
quiet
way
no
fuss
you
know
i
should
go
and
have
a
chat
with
your
father
and
tell
him
we
found
out
about
this
thing
i
touched
the
divided
post
young
jarnock
seemed
very
grateful
for
my
advice
and
after
shaking
my
hand
pretty
hard
took
my
key
and
let
himself
out
of
the
chapel
he
came
back
in
about
an
hour
looking
rather
upset
he
told
me
that
my
conclusions
were
perfectly
correct
it
was
sir
alfred
jarnock
who
had
set
the
trap
both
on
the
night
that
the
butler
was
nearly
killed
and
on
the
past
night
indeed
it
seemed
that
the
old
gentleman
had
set
it
every
night
for
many
years
he
had
learnt
of
its
existence
from
an
old
manuscript
book
in
the
castle
library
it
had
been
planned
and
used
in
an
earlier
age
as
a
protection
for
the
gold
vessels
of
the
ritual
which
were
it
seemed
kept
in
a
hidden
recess
at
the
back
of
the
altar
this
recess
sir
alfred
jarnock
had
utilized
secretly
to
store
his
wife
jewelry
she
had
died
some
twelve
years
back
and
the
young
man
told
me
that
his
father
had
never
seemed
quite
himself
since
i
mentioned
to
young
jarnock
how
puzzled
i
was
that
the
trap
had
been
set
the
service
on
the
night
that
the
butler
was
struck
for
if
i
understood
him
aright
his
father
had
been
in
the
habit
of
setting
the
trap
late
every
night
and
unsetting
it
each
morning
before
anyone
entered
the
chapel
he
replied
that
his
father
in
a
fit
of
temporary
forgetfulness
natural
enough
in
his
neurotic
condition
must
have
set
it
too
early
and
hence
what
had
so
nearly
proved
a
tragedy
that
is
about
all
there
is
to
tell
the
old
man
is
not
so
far
as
i
could
learn
really
insane
in
the
popularly
accepted
sense
of
the
word
he
is
extremely
neurotic
and
has
developed
into
a
hypochondriac
the
whole
condition
probably
brought
about
by
the
shock
and
sorrow
resultant
on
the
death
of
his
wife
leading
to
years
of
sad
broodings
and
to
overmuch
of
his
own
company
and
thoughts
indeed
young
jarnock
told
me
that
his
father
would
sometimes
pray
for
hours
together
alone
in
the
chapel
carnacki
made
an
end
of
speaking
and
leant
forward
for
a
spill
but
you
never
told
us
just
you
discovered
the
secret
of
the
divided
post
and
all
that
i
said
speaking
for
the
four
of
us
oh
that
replied
carnacki
puffing
vigorously
at
his
pipe
i
found
on
comparing
the
photos
that
the
one
taken
in
the
daytime
showed
a
thicker
gatepost
than
the
one
taken
at
night
by
the
flashlight
that
put
me
on
to
the
track
i
saw
at
once
that
there
might
be
some
mechanical
dodge
at
the
back
of
the
whole
queer
business
and
nothing
at
all
of
an
abnormal
nature
i
examined
the
post
and
the
rest
was
simple
enough
you
know
by
the
way
he
continued
rising
and
going
to
the
mantelpiece
you
may
be
interested
to
have
a
look
at
the
dagger
young
jarnock
was
kind
enough
to
present
it
to
me
as
a
little
memento
of
my
adventure
he
handed
it
to
us
and
whilst
we
examined
it
stood
silent
before
the
fire
puffing
meditatively
at
his
pipe
jarnock
and
i
made
the
trap
so
that
it
wo
work
he
remarked
after
a
few
moments
i
got
the
dagger
as
you
see
and
old
bellett
getting
about
again
so
that
the
whole
business
can
be
hushed
up
decently
all
the
same
i
fancy
the
chapel
will
never
lose
its
reputation
as
a
dangerous
place
should
be
pretty
safe
now
to
keep
valuables
in
there
two
things
you
have
explained
yet
i
said
what
do
you
think
caused
the
two
clangey
sounds
when
you
were
in
the
chapel
in
the
dark
and
do
you
believe
the
soft
tready
sounds
were
real
or
only
a
fancy
with
your
being
so
worked
up
and
tense
do
know
for
certain
about
the
clangs
replied
carnacki
i
puzzled
quite
a
bit
about
them
i
can
only
think
that
the
spring
which
worked
the
post
must
have
a
trifle
slipped
you
know
in
the
catch
if
it
did
under
such
a
tension
it
would
make
a
bit
of
a
ringing
noise
and
a
little
sound
goes
a
long
way
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
you
thinking
of
you
can
understand
that
eh
yes
i
agreed
and
the
other
sounds
well
the
same
thing
i
mean
the
extraordinary
quietness
may
help
to
explain
these
a
bit
they
may
have
been
some
usual
enough
sound
that
would
never
have
been
noticed
under
ordinary
conditions
or
they
may
have
been
only
fancy
it
is
just
impossible
to
say
they
were
disgustingly
real
to
me
as
for
the
slithery
noise
i
am
pretty
sure
that
one
of
the
tripod
legs
of
my
camera
must
have
slipped
a
few
inches
if
it
did
so
it
may
easily
have
jolted
the
lens
cap
off
the
baseboard
which
would
account
for
that
queer
little
tap
which
i
heard
directly
after
how
do
you
account
for
the
dagger
being
in
its
place
above
the
altar
when
you
first
examined
it
that
night
i
asked
how
could
it
be
there
when
at
that
very
moment
it
was
set
in
the
trap
that
was
my
mistake
replied
carnacki
the
dagger
could
not
possibly
have
been
in
its
sheath
at
the
time
though
i
thought
it
was
you
see
the
curious
sheath
gave
the
appearance
of
the
complete
weapon
as
you
can
understand
the
hilt
of
the
dagger
protrudes
very
little
above
the
continued
portion
of
the
sheath
a
most
inconvenient
arrangement
for
drawing
quickly
he
nodded
sagely
at
the
lot
of
us
and
yawned
then
glanced
at
the
clock
out
you
go
he
said
in
friendly
fashion
using
the
recognized
formula
i
want
a
sleep
we
rose
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
went
out
presently
into
the
night
and
the
quiet
of
the
embankment
and
so
to
our
homes
