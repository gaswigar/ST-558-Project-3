the
education
of
the
child
by
ellen
key
introductory
note
edward
bok
editor
of
the
ladies
home
journal
writes
nothing
finer
on
the
wise
education
of
the
child
has
ever
been
brought
into
print
to
me
this
chapter
is
a
perfect
classic
it
points
the
way
straight
for
every
parent
and
it
should
find
a
place
in
every
home
in
america
where
there
is
a
child
the
education
of
the
child
goethe
showed
long
ago
in
his
werther
a
clear
understanding
of
the
significance
of
individualistic
and
psychological
training
an
appreciation
which
will
mark
the
century
of
the
child
in
this
work
he
shows
how
the
future
power
of
will
lies
hidden
in
the
characteristics
of
the
child
and
how
along
with
every
fault
of
the
child
an
uncorrupted
germ
capable
of
producing
good
is
enclosed
always
he
says
i
repeat
the
golden
words
of
the
teacher
of
mankind
ye
do
not
become
as
one
of
these
and
now
good
friend
those
who
are
our
equals
whom
we
should
look
upon
as
our
models
we
treat
as
subjects
they
should
have
no
will
of
their
own
do
we
have
none
where
is
our
prerogative
does
it
consist
in
the
fact
that
we
are
older
and
more
experienced
good
god
of
heaven
thou
seest
old
and
young
children
nothing
else
and
in
whom
thou
hast
more
joy
thy
son
announced
ages
ago
but
people
believe
in
him
and
do
not
hear
him
that
too
is
an
old
trouble
and
they
model
their
children
after
themselves
the
same
criticism
might
be
applied
to
our
present
educators
who
constantly
have
on
their
tongues
such
words
as
evolution
individuality
and
natural
tendencies
but
do
not
heed
the
new
commandments
in
which
they
say
they
believe
they
continue
to
educate
as
if
they
believed
still
in
the
natural
depravity
of
man
in
original
sin
which
may
be
bridled
tamed
suppressed
but
not
changed
the
new
belief
is
really
equivalent
to
goethe
thoughts
given
above
that
almost
every
fault
is
but
a
hard
shell
enclosing
the
germ
of
virtue
even
men
of
modern
times
still
follow
in
education
the
old
rule
of
medicine
that
evil
must
be
driven
out
by
evil
instead
of
the
new
method
the
system
of
allowing
nature
quietly
and
slowly
to
help
itself
taking
care
only
that
the
surrounding
conditions
help
the
work
of
nature
this
is
education
neither
harsh
nor
tender
parents
suspect
the
truth
expressed
by
carlyle
when
he
said
that
the
marks
of
a
noble
and
original
temperament
are
wild
strong
emotions
that
must
be
controlled
by
a
discipline
as
hard
as
steel
people
either
strive
to
root
out
passions
altogether
or
they
abstain
from
teaching
the
child
to
get
them
under
control
to
suppress
the
real
personality
of
the
child
and
to
supplant
it
with
another
personality
continues
to
be
a
pedagogical
crime
common
to
those
who
announce
loudly
that
education
should
only
develop
the
real
individual
nature
of
the
child
they
are
still
not
convinced
that
egoism
on
the
part
of
the
child
is
justified
just
as
little
are
they
convinced
of
the
possibility
that
evil
can
be
changed
into
good
education
must
be
based
on
the
certainty
that
faults
can
not
be
atoned
for
or
blotted
out
but
must
always
have
their
consequences
at
the
same
time
there
is
the
other
certainty
that
through
progressive
evolution
by
slow
adaptation
to
the
conditions
of
environment
they
may
be
transformed
only
when
this
stage
is
reached
will
education
begin
to
be
a
science
and
art
we
will
then
give
up
all
belief
in
the
miraculous
effects
of
sudden
interference
we
shall
act
in
the
psychological
sphere
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
the
indestructibility
of
matter
we
shall
never
believe
that
a
characteristic
of
the
soul
can
be
destroyed
there
are
but
two
possibilities
either
it
can
be
brought
into
subjection
or
it
can
be
raised
up
to
a
higher
plane
madame
de
stael
words
show
much
insight
when
she
says
that
only
the
people
who
can
play
with
children
are
able
to
educate
them
for
success
in
training
children
the
first
condition
is
to
become
as
a
child
oneself
but
this
means
no
assumed
childishness
no
condescending
that
the
child
immediately
sees
through
and
deeply
abhors
what
it
does
mean
is
to
be
as
entirely
and
simply
taken
up
with
the
child
as
the
child
himself
is
absorbed
by
his
life
it
means
to
treat
the
child
as
really
one
equal
that
is
to
show
him
the
same
consideration
the
same
kind
confidence
one
shows
to
an
adult
it
means
not
to
influence
the
child
to
be
what
we
ourselves
desire
him
to
become
but
to
be
influenced
by
the
impression
of
what
the
child
himself
is
not
to
treat
the
child
with
deception
or
by
the
exercise
of
force
but
with
the
seriousness
and
sincerity
proper
to
his
own
character
somewhere
rousseau
says
that
all
education
has
failed
in
that
nature
does
not
fashion
parents
as
educators
nor
children
for
the
sake
of
education
what
would
happen
if
we
finally
succeeded
in
following
the
directions
of
nature
and
recognised
that
the
great
secret
of
education
lies
hidden
in
the
maxim
do
not
educate
not
leaving
the
child
in
peace
is
the
greatest
evil
of
methods
of
training
children
education
is
determined
to
create
a
beautiful
world
externally
and
internally
in
which
the
child
can
grow
to
let
him
move
about
freely
in
this
world
until
he
comes
into
contact
with
the
permanent
boundaries
of
another
right
will
be
the
end
of
the
education
of
the
future
only
then
will
adults
really
obtain
a
deep
insight
into
the
souls
of
children
now
an
almost
inaccessible
kingdom
for
it
is
a
natural
instinct
of
which
causes
the
child
to
bar
the
educator
from
his
innermost
nature
there
is
the
person
who
asks
rude
questions
for
example
what
is
the
child
thinking
about
a
question
which
almost
invariably
is
answered
with
a
black
or
a
white
lie
the
child
must
protect
himself
from
an
educator
who
would
master
his
thoughts
and
inclinations
or
rudely
handle
them
who
without
consideration
betrays
or
makes
ridiculous
his
most
sacred
feelings
who
exposes
faults
or
praises
characteristics
before
strangers
or
even
uses
an
confidential
confession
as
an
occasion
for
reproof
at
another
time
the
statement
that
no
human
being
learns
to
understand
another
or
at
least
to
be
patient
with
another
is
true
above
all
of
the
intimate
relation
of
child
and
parent
in
which
understanding
the
deepest
characteristic
of
love
is
almost
always
absent
parents
do
not
see
that
during
the
whole
life
the
need
of
peace
is
never
greater
than
in
the
years
of
childhood
an
inner
peace
under
all
external
unrest
the
child
has
to
enter
into
relations
with
his
own
infinite
world
to
conquer
it
to
make
it
the
object
of
his
dreams
but
what
does
he
experience
obstacles
interference
corrections
the
whole
livelong
day
the
child
is
always
required
to
leave
something
alone
or
to
do
something
different
to
find
something
different
or
want
something
different
from
what
he
does
or
finds
or
wants
he
is
always
shunted
off
in
another
direction
from
that
towards
which
his
own
character
is
leading
him
all
of
this
is
caused
by
our
tenderness
vigilance
and
zeal
in
directing
advising
and
helping
the
small
specimen
of
humanity
to
become
a
complete
example
in
a
model
series
i
have
heard
a
child
characterised
as
trying
because
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
woods
whereas
the
nursemaid
wished
to
drag
him
into
the
city
another
child
of
six
years
was
disciplined
because
she
had
been
naughty
to
a
playmate
and
had
called
her
a
little
pig
a
natural
appellation
for
one
who
was
always
dirty
these
are
typical
examples
of
how
the
sound
instincts
of
the
child
are
dulled
it
was
a
spontaneous
utterance
of
the
childish
heart
when
a
small
boy
after
an
account
of
the
heaven
of
good
children
asked
his
mother
whether
she
did
not
believe
that
after
he
had
been
good
a
whole
week
in
heaven
he
might
be
allowed
to
go
to
hell
on
saturday
evening
to
play
with
the
bad
little
boys
there
the
child
felt
in
its
innermost
consciousness
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
naughty
a
fundamental
right
which
is
accorded
to
adults
and
not
only
to
be
naughty
but
to
be
naughty
in
peace
to
be
left
to
the
dangers
and
joys
of
naughtiness
to
call
forth
from
this
unvirtue
the
complimentary
virtue
is
to
overcome
evil
with
good
otherwise
we
overcome
natural
strength
by
weak
means
and
obtain
artificial
virtues
which
will
not
stand
the
tests
which
life
imposes
it
seems
simple
enough
when
we
say
that
we
must
overcome
evil
with
good
but
practically
no
process
is
more
involved
or
more
tedious
than
to
find
actual
means
to
accomplish
this
end
it
is
much
easier
to
say
what
one
shall
not
do
than
what
one
must
do
to
change
into
strength
of
character
slyness
into
prudence
the
desire
to
please
into
amiability
restlessness
into
personal
initiative
it
can
only
be
brought
about
by
recognising
that
evil
in
so
far
as
it
is
not
atavistic
or
perverse
is
as
natural
and
indispensable
as
the
good
and
that
it
becomes
a
permanent
evil
only
through
its
supremacy
the
educator
wants
the
child
to
be
finished
at
once
and
perfect
he
forces
upon
the
child
an
unnatural
degree
of
a
devotion
to
duty
a
sense
of
honour
habits
that
adults
get
out
of
with
astonishing
rapidity
where
the
faults
of
children
are
concerned
at
home
and
in
school
we
strain
at
gnats
while
children
daily
are
obliged
to
swallow
the
camels
of
grown
people
the
art
of
natural
education
consists
in
ignoring
the
faults
of
children
nine
times
out
of
ten
in
avoiding
immediate
interference
which
is
usually
a
mistake
and
devoting
one
whole
vigilance
to
the
control
of
the
environment
in
which
the
child
is
growing
up
to
watching
the
education
which
is
allowed
to
go
on
by
itself
but
educators
who
day
in
and
day
out
are
consciously
transforming
the
environment
and
themselves
are
still
a
rare
product
most
people
live
on
the
capital
and
interest
of
an
education
which
perhaps
once
made
them
model
children
but
has
deprived
them
of
the
desire
for
educating
themselves
only
by
keeping
oneself
in
constant
process
of
growth
under
the
constant
influence
of
the
best
things
in
one
own
age
does
one
become
a
companion
good
enough
for
one
children
to
bring
up
a
child
means
carrying
one
soul
in
one
hand
setting
one
feet
on
a
narrow
path
it
means
never
placing
ourselves
in
danger
of
meeting
the
cold
look
on
the
part
of
the
child
that
tells
us
without
words
that
he
finds
us
insufficient
and
unreliable
it
means
the
humble
realisation
of
the
truth
that
the
ways
of
injuring
the
child
are
infinite
while
the
ways
of
being
useful
to
him
are
few
how
seldom
does
the
educator
remember
that
the
child
even
at
four
or
five
years
of
age
is
making
experiments
with
adults
seeing
through
them
with
marvellous
shrewdness
making
his
own
valuations
and
reacting
sensitively
to
each
impression
the
slightest
mistrust
the
smallest
unkindness
the
least
act
of
injustice
or
contemptuous
ridicule
leave
wounds
that
last
for
life
in
the
finely
strung
soul
of
the
child
while
on
the
other
side
unexpected
friendliness
kind
advances
just
indignation
make
quite
as
deep
an
impression
on
those
senses
which
people
term
as
soft
as
wax
but
treat
as
if
they
were
made
of
cowhide
relatively
most
excellent
was
the
old
education
which
consisted
solely
in
keeping
oneself
whole
pure
and
honourable
for
it
did
not
at
least
depreciate
personality
although
it
did
not
form
it
it
would
be
well
if
but
a
hundredth
part
of
the
pains
now
taken
by
parents
were
given
to
interference
with
the
life
of
the
child
and
the
rest
of
the
ninety
and
nine
employed
in
leading
without
interference
in
acting
as
an
unforeseen
an
invisible
providence
through
which
the
child
obtains
experience
from
which
he
may
draw
his
own
conclusions
the
present
practice
is
to
impress
one
own
discoveries
opinions
and
principles
on
the
child
by
constantly
directing
his
actions
the
last
thing
to
be
realised
by
the
educator
is
that
he
really
has
before
him
an
entirely
new
soul
a
real
self
whose
first
and
chief
right
is
to
think
over
the
things
with
which
he
comes
in
contact
by
a
new
soul
he
understands
only
a
new
generation
of
an
old
humanity
to
be
treated
with
a
fresh
dose
of
the
old
remedy
we
teach
the
new
souls
not
to
steal
not
to
lie
to
save
their
clothes
to
learn
their
lessons
to
economise
their
money
to
obey
commands
not
to
contradict
older
people
say
their
prayers
to
fight
occasionally
in
order
to
be
strong
but
who
teaches
the
new
souls
to
choose
for
themselves
the
path
they
must
tread
who
thinks
that
the
desire
for
this
path
of
their
own
can
be
so
profound
that
a
hard
or
even
mild
pressure
towards
uniformity
can
make
the
whole
of
childhood
a
torment
the
child
comes
into
life
with
the
inheritance
of
the
preceding
members
of
the
race
and
this
inheritance
is
modified
by
adaptation
to
the
environment
but
the
child
shows
also
individual
variations
from
the
type
of
the
species
and
if
his
own
character
is
not
to
disappear
during
the
process
of
adaptation
all
development
of
energy
must
be
aided
in
every
way
and
only
indirectly
influenced
by
the
teacher
who
should
understand
how
to
combine
and
emphasise
the
results
of
this
development
interference
on
the
part
of
the
educator
whether
by
force
or
persuasion
weakens
this
development
if
it
does
not
destroy
it
altogether
the
habits
of
the
household
and
the
child
habits
in
it
must
be
absolutely
fixed
if
they
are
to
be
of
any
value
amiel
truly
says
that
habits
are
principles
which
have
become
instincts
and
have
passed
over
into
flesh
and
blood
to
change
habits
he
continues
means
to
attack
life
in
its
very
essence
for
life
is
only
a
web
of
habits
why
does
everything
remain
essentially
the
same
from
generation
to
generation
why
do
highly
civilised
christian
people
continue
to
plunder
one
another
and
call
it
exchange
to
murder
one
another
en
masse
and
call
it
nationalism
to
oppress
one
another
and
call
it
statesmanship
because
in
every
new
generation
the
impulses
supposed
to
have
been
rooted
out
by
discipline
in
the
child
break
forth
again
when
the
struggle
for
existence
of
the
individual
in
society
of
the
society
in
the
life
of
the
state
begins
these
passions
are
not
transformed
by
the
prevalent
education
of
the
day
but
only
repressed
practically
this
is
the
reason
why
not
a
single
savage
passion
has
been
overcome
in
humanity
perhaps
may
be
mentioned
as
an
exception
but
what
is
told
of
european
ship
companies
or
siberian
prisoners
shows
that
even
this
impulse
under
conditions
favourable
to
it
may
be
revived
although
in
the
majority
of
people
a
deep
physical
antipathy
to
is
innate
conscious
incest
despite
similar
deviations
must
also
be
physically
contrary
to
the
majority
and
in
a
number
of
women
modesty
the
unity
between
body
and
soul
in
relation
to
love
is
an
incontestable
provision
of
nature
so
too
a
minority
would
find
it
physically
impossible
to
murder
or
steal
with
this
list
i
have
exhausted
everything
which
mankind
since
its
conscious
history
began
has
really
so
intimately
acquired
that
the
achievement
is
passed
on
in
its
flesh
and
blood
only
this
kind
of
conquest
can
really
stand
up
against
temptation
in
every
form
a
deep
physiological
truth
is
hidden
in
the
use
of
language
when
one
speaks
of
unchained
passions
the
passions
under
the
prevailing
system
of
education
are
really
only
beasts
of
prey
imprisoned
in
cages
while
fine
words
are
spoken
about
individual
development
children
are
treated
as
if
their
personality
had
no
purpose
of
its
own
as
if
they
were
made
only
for
the
pleasure
pride
and
comfort
of
their
parents
and
as
these
aims
are
best
advanced
when
children
become
like
every
one
else
people
usually
begin
by
attempting
to
make
them
respectable
and
useful
members
of
society
but
the
only
correct
starting
point
so
far
as
a
child
education
in
becoming
a
social
human
being
is
concerned
is
to
treat
him
as
such
while
strengthening
his
natural
disposition
to
become
an
individual
human
being
the
new
educator
will
by
regularly
ordered
experience
teach
the
child
by
degrees
his
place
in
the
great
orderly
system
of
existence
teach
him
his
responsibility
towards
his
environment
but
in
other
respects
none
of
the
individual
characteristics
of
the
child
expressive
of
his
life
will
be
suppressed
so
long
as
they
do
not
injure
the
child
himself
or
others
the
right
balance
must
be
kept
between
spencer
definition
of
life
as
an
adaptation
to
surrounding
conditions
and
definition
of
it
as
the
will
to
secure
power
in
adaptation
imitation
certainly
plays
a
great
role
but
individual
exercise
of
power
is
just
as
important
through
adaptation
life
attains
a
fixed
form
through
exercise
of
power
new
factors
thoughtful
people
as
i
have
already
stated
talk
a
good
deal
about
personality
but
they
are
nevertheless
filled
with
doubts
when
their
children
are
not
just
like
all
other
children
when
they
can
not
show
in
their
offspring
all
the
virtues
required
by
society
and
so
they
drill
their
children
repressing
in
childhood
the
natural
instincts
which
will
have
freedom
when
they
are
grown
people
still
hardly
realise
how
new
human
beings
are
formed
therefore
the
old
types
constantly
repeat
themselves
in
the
same
circle
the
fine
young
men
the
sweet
girls
the
respectable
officials
and
so
on
and
new
types
with
higher
ideals
travellers
on
unknown
paths
thinkers
of
yet
unthought
thoughts
people
capable
of
the
crime
of
inaugurating
new
ways
such
types
rarely
come
into
existence
among
those
who
are
well
brought
up
nature
herself
it
is
true
repeats
the
main
types
constantly
but
she
also
constantly
makes
small
deviations
in
this
way
different
species
even
of
the
human
race
have
come
into
existence
but
man
himself
does
not
yet
see
the
significance
of
this
natural
law
in
his
own
higher
development
he
wants
the
feelings
thoughts
and
judgments
already
stamped
with
approval
to
be
reproduced
by
each
new
generation
so
we
get
no
new
individuals
but
only
more
or
less
prudent
stupid
amiable
or
examples
of
the
genus
man
the
still
living
instincts
of
the
ape
double
in
the
case
of
man
the
effect
of
heredity
conservatism
is
for
the
present
stronger
in
mankind
than
the
effort
to
produce
new
types
but
this
last
characteristic
is
the
most
valuable
the
educator
should
do
anything
but
advise
the
child
to
do
what
everybody
does
he
should
rather
rejoice
when
he
sees
in
the
child
tendencies
to
deviation
using
other
people
opinion
as
a
standard
results
in
subordinating
one
self
to
their
will
so
we
become
a
part
of
the
great
mass
led
by
the
superman
through
the
strength
of
his
will
a
will
which
could
not
have
mastered
strong
personalities
it
has
been
justly
remarked
that
individual
peoples
like
the
english
have
attained
the
greatest
political
and
social
freedom
because
the
personal
feeling
of
independence
is
far
in
excess
of
freedom
in
a
legal
form
accordingly
legal
freedom
has
been
constantly
growing
for
the
progress
of
the
whole
of
the
species
as
well
as
of
society
it
is
essential
that
education
shall
awake
the
feeling
of
independence
it
should
invigorate
and
favour
the
disposition
to
deviate
from
the
type
in
those
cases
where
the
rights
of
others
are
not
affected
or
where
deviation
is
not
simply
the
result
of
the
desire
to
draw
attention
to
oneself
the
child
should
be
given
the
chance
to
declare
conscientiously
his
independence
of
a
customary
usage
of
an
ordinary
feeling
for
this
is
the
foundation
of
the
education
of
an
individual
as
well
as
the
basis
of
a
collective
conscience
which
is
the
only
kind
of
conscience
men
now
have
what
does
having
an
individual
conscience
mean
it
means
submitting
voluntarily
to
an
external
law
attested
and
found
good
by
my
own
conscience
it
means
unconditionally
heeding
the
unwritten
law
which
i
lay
upon
myself
and
following
this
inner
law
even
when
i
must
stand
alone
against
the
whole
world
it
is
a
frequent
phenomenon
we
can
almost
call
it
a
regular
one
that
it
is
original
natures
particularly
talented
beings
who
are
badly
treated
at
home
and
in
school
no
one
considers
the
sources
of
conduct
in
a
child
who
shows
fear
or
makes
a
noise
or
who
is
absorbed
in
himself
or
who
has
an
impetuous
nature
mothers
and
teachers
show
in
this
their
pitiable
incapacity
for
the
most
elementary
part
in
the
art
of
education
that
is
to
be
able
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
not
with
pedagogical
doctrines
in
their
head
i
naturally
expect
in
the
supporters
of
society
with
their
conventional
morality
no
appreciation
of
the
significance
of
the
child
putting
into
exercise
his
own
powers
just
as
little
is
this
to
be
expected
of
those
christian
believers
who
think
that
human
nature
must
be
brought
to
repentance
and
humility
and
that
the
sinful
body
the
unclean
beast
must
be
tamed
with
the
rod
a
theory
which
the
bible
is
brought
to
support
i
am
only
addressing
people
who
can
think
new
thoughts
and
consequently
should
cease
using
old
methods
of
education
this
class
may
reply
that
the
new
ideas
in
education
can
not
be
carried
out
but
the
obstacle
is
simply
that
their
new
thoughts
have
not
made
them
into
new
men
the
old
man
in
them
has
neither
repose
nor
time
nor
patience
to
form
his
own
soul
and
that
of
the
child
according
to
the
new
thoughts
those
who
have
tried
spencer
and
failed
because
spencer
method
demands
intelligence
and
patience
contend
that
the
child
must
be
taught
to
obey
that
truth
lies
in
the
old
rule
as
the
twig
is
bent
the
tree
is
inclined
bent
is
the
appropriate
word
bent
according
to
the
old
ideal
which
extinguishes
personality
teaches
humility
and
obedience
but
the
new
ideal
is
that
man
to
stand
straight
and
upright
must
not
be
bent
at
all
only
supported
and
so
prevented
from
being
deformed
by
weakness
one
often
finds
in
the
modern
system
of
training
the
crude
desire
for
mastery
still
alive
and
breaking
out
when
the
child
is
obstinate
you
wo
say
father
and
mother
i
will
teach
you
whether
you
have
a
will
i
will
soon
drive
out
of
you
but
nothing
can
be
driven
out
of
the
child
on
the
other
hand
much
can
be
scourged
into
it
which
should
be
kept
far
away
only
during
the
first
few
years
of
life
is
a
kind
of
drill
necessary
as
a
to
a
higher
training
the
child
is
then
in
such
a
high
degree
controlled
by
sensation
that
a
slight
physical
pain
or
pleasure
is
often
the
only
language
he
fully
understands
consequently
for
some
children
discipline
is
an
indispensable
means
of
enforcing
the
practice
of
certain
habits
for
other
children
the
stricter
methods
are
entirely
unnecessary
even
at
this
early
age
and
as
soon
as
the
child
can
remember
a
blow
he
is
too
old
to
receive
one
the
child
must
certainly
learn
obedience
and
besides
this
obedience
must
be
absolute
if
such
obedience
has
become
habitual
from
the
tenderest
age
a
look
a
word
an
intonation
is
enough
to
keep
the
child
straight
the
dissatisfaction
of
those
who
are
bringing
him
up
can
only
be
made
effective
when
it
falls
as
a
shadow
in
the
usual
sunny
atmosphere
of
home
and
if
people
refrain
from
laying
the
foundations
of
obedience
while
the
child
is
small
and
his
naughtiness
is
entertaining
spencer
method
undoubtedly
will
be
found
unsuitable
after
the
child
is
older
and
his
caprice
disagreeable
with
a
very
small
child
one
should
not
argue
but
act
consistently
and
immediately
the
effort
of
training
should
be
directed
at
an
early
period
to
arrange
the
experiences
in
a
consistent
whole
of
impressions
according
to
rousseau
and
spencer
recommendation
so
certain
habits
will
become
impressed
in
the
flesh
and
blood
of
the
child
constant
crying
on
the
part
of
small
children
must
be
corrected
when
it
has
become
clear
that
the
crying
is
not
caused
by
illness
or
some
other
discomfort
discomforts
against
which
crying
is
the
child
only
weapon
crying
is
now
ordinarily
corrected
by
blows
but
this
does
not
master
the
will
of
the
child
and
only
produces
in
his
soul
the
idea
that
older
people
strike
small
children
when
small
children
cry
this
is
not
an
ethical
idea
but
when
the
crying
child
is
immediately
isolated
and
it
is
explained
to
him
at
the
same
time
that
whoever
annoys
others
must
not
be
with
them
if
this
isolation
is
the
absolute
result
and
can
not
be
avoided
in
the
child
mind
a
basis
is
laid
for
the
experience
that
one
must
be
alone
when
one
makes
oneself
unpleasant
or
disagreeable
in
both
cases
the
child
is
silenced
by
interfering
with
his
comfort
but
one
type
of
discomfort
is
the
exercise
of
force
on
his
will
the
other
produces
slowly
the
of
the
will
and
accomplishes
this
by
a
good
motive
one
method
encourages
a
base
emotion
fear
the
other
corrects
the
will
in
a
way
that
combines
it
with
one
of
the
most
important
experiences
of
life
the
one
punishment
keeps
the
child
on
the
level
of
the
animal
the
other
impresses
upon
him
the
great
principle
of
human
social
life
that
when
our
pleasure
causes
displeasure
to
others
other
people
hinder
us
from
following
our
pleasures
or
withdraw
themselves
from
the
exercise
of
our
it
is
necessary
that
small
children
should
accustom
themselves
to
good
behaviour
at
table
etc
if
every
time
an
act
of
naughtiness
is
repeated
the
child
is
immediately
taken
away
he
will
soon
learn
that
whoever
is
disagreeable
to
others
must
remain
alone
thus
a
right
application
is
made
of
a
right
principle
small
children
too
must
learn
not
to
touch
what
belongs
to
other
people
if
every
time
anything
is
touched
without
permission
children
lose
their
freedom
of
action
one
way
or
another
they
soon
learn
that
a
condition
of
their
free
action
is
not
to
injure
others
it
is
quite
true
as
a
young
mother
remarked
that
empty
japanese
rooms
are
ideal
places
in
which
to
bring
up
children
our
modern
crowded
rooms
are
so
far
as
children
are
concerned
to
be
condemned
during
the
year
in
which
the
real
education
of
the
child
is
proceeding
by
touching
tasting
biting
feeling
and
so
on
every
moment
he
is
hearing
the
cry
let
it
alone
for
the
temperament
of
the
child
as
well
as
for
the
development
of
his
powers
the
best
thing
is
a
large
light
nursery
adorned
with
handsome
lithographs
and
so
on
provided
with
some
simple
furniture
where
he
may
enjoy
the
fullest
freedom
of
movement
but
if
the
child
is
there
with
his
parents
and
is
disobedient
a
momentary
reprimand
is
the
best
means
to
teach
him
to
reverence
the
greater
world
in
which
the
will
of
others
prevails
the
world
in
which
the
child
certainly
can
make
a
place
for
himself
but
must
also
learn
that
every
place
occupied
by
him
has
its
limits
if
it
is
a
case
of
a
danger
which
it
is
desirable
that
the
child
should
really
dread
we
must
allow
the
thing
itself
to
have
an
alarming
influence
when
a
mother
strikes
a
child
because
he
touches
the
light
the
result
is
that
he
does
this
again
when
the
mother
is
away
but
let
him
burn
himself
with
the
light
then
he
is
certain
to
leave
it
alone
in
riper
years
when
a
boy
misuses
a
knife
a
toy
or
something
similar
the
loss
of
the
object
for
the
time
being
must
be
the
punishment
most
boys
would
prefer
corporal
punishment
to
the
loss
of
their
favourite
possession
but
only
the
loss
of
it
will
be
a
real
education
through
experience
of
one
of
the
inevitable
rules
of
life
an
experience
which
can
not
be
too
strongly
impressed
we
hear
parents
who
have
begun
with
spencer
and
then
have
taken
to
corporal
punishment
declare
that
when
children
are
too
small
to
repair
the
clothing
which
they
have
torn
there
must
be
some
other
kind
of
punishment
but
at
that
age
they
should
not
be
punished
at
all
for
such
things
they
should
have
such
simple
and
strong
clothes
that
they
can
play
freely
in
them
later
on
when
they
can
be
really
careful
the
natural
punishment
would
be
to
have
the
child
remain
at
home
if
he
is
careless
has
spotted
his
clothes
or
torn
them
he
must
be
shown
that
he
must
help
to
put
his
clothes
in
good
condition
again
or
that
he
will
be
compelled
to
buy
what
he
has
destroyed
carelessly
with
money
earned
by
himself
if
the
child
is
not
careful
he
must
stay
at
home
when
ordinarily
allowed
to
go
out
or
eat
alone
if
he
is
too
late
for
meals
it
may
be
said
that
there
are
simple
means
by
which
all
the
important
habits
of
social
life
may
become
a
second
nature
but
it
is
not
possible
in
all
cases
to
apply
spencer
method
the
natural
consequences
occasionally
endanger
the
health
of
the
child
or
sometimes
are
too
slow
in
their
action
if
it
seems
necessary
to
interfere
directly
such
action
must
be
consistent
quick
and
immutable
how
is
it
that
the
child
learns
very
soon
that
fire
burns
because
fire
does
so
always
but
the
mother
who
at
one
time
strikes
at
another
threatens
at
another
bribes
the
child
first
forbids
and
then
immediately
after
permits
some
action
who
does
not
carry
out
her
threat
does
not
compel
obedience
but
constantly
gabbles
and
scolds
who
sometimes
acts
in
one
way
and
just
as
often
in
another
has
not
learned
the
effective
educational
methods
of
the
fire
the
strict
training
that
in
its
crude
way
gave
to
the
character
a
fixed
type
rested
on
its
consistent
qualities
it
was
consistently
strict
not
as
at
present
a
lax
hesitation
between
all
kinds
of
pedagogical
methods
and
psychological
opinions
in
which
the
child
is
thrown
about
here
and
there
like
a
ball
in
the
hands
of
grown
people
at
one
time
pushed
forward
then
laughed
at
then
pushed
aside
only
to
be
brought
back
again
kissed
till
it
is
disgusted
first
ordered
about
and
then
coaxed
a
grown
man
would
become
insane
if
joking
titans
treated
him
for
a
single
day
as
a
child
is
treated
for
a
year
a
child
should
not
be
ordered
about
but
should
be
just
as
courteously
addressed
as
a
grown
person
in
order
that
he
may
learn
courtesy
a
child
should
never
be
pushed
into
notice
never
compelled
to
endure
caresses
never
overwhelmed
with
kisses
which
ordinarily
torment
him
and
are
often
the
cause
of
sexual
hyperaesthesia
the
demonstrations
of
affection
should
be
reciprocated
when
they
are
sincere
but
one
own
demonstrations
should
be
reserved
for
special
occasions
this
is
one
of
the
many
excellent
maxims
of
training
that
are
disregarded
nor
should
the
child
be
forced
to
express
regret
in
begging
pardon
and
the
like
this
is
excellent
training
for
hypocrisy
a
small
child
once
had
been
rude
to
his
elder
brother
and
was
placed
upon
a
chair
to
repent
his
fault
when
the
mother
after
a
time
asked
if
he
was
sorry
he
answered
yes
with
emphasis
but
as
the
mother
saw
a
mutinous
sparkle
in
his
eyes
she
felt
impelled
to
ask
sorry
for
what
and
the
youngster
broke
out
sorry
that
i
did
not
call
him
a
liar
besides
the
mother
was
wise
enough
on
this
occasion
and
ever
after
to
give
up
insisting
on
repentance
spontaneous
penitence
is
full
of
significance
it
is
a
deeply
felt
desire
for
pardon
but
an
artificial
emotion
is
always
and
everywhere
worthless
are
you
not
sorry
does
it
make
no
difference
to
you
that
your
mother
is
ill
your
brother
dead
your
father
away
from
home
such
expressions
are
often
used
as
an
appeal
to
the
emotions
of
children
but
children
have
a
right
to
have
feelings
or
not
have
them
and
to
have
them
as
undisturbed
as
grown
people
the
same
holds
good
of
their
sympathies
and
antipathies
the
sensitive
feelings
of
children
are
constantly
injured
by
lack
of
consideration
on
the
part
of
grown
people
their
easily
stimulated
aversions
are
constantly
being
brought
out
but
the
sufferings
of
children
through
the
crudeness
of
their
elders
belong
to
an
unwritten
chapter
of
child
psychology
just
as
there
are
few
better
methods
of
training
than
to
ask
children
when
they
have
behaved
unjustly
to
others
to
consider
whether
it
would
be
pleasant
for
them
to
be
treated
in
that
way
so
there
is
no
better
corrective
for
the
trainer
of
children
than
the
habit
of
asking
oneself
in
question
small
and
great
would
i
consent
to
be
treated
as
i
have
just
treated
my
child
if
it
were
only
remembered
that
the
child
generally
suffers
double
as
much
as
the
adult
parents
would
perhaps
learn
physical
and
psychical
tenderness
without
which
a
child
life
is
a
constant
torment
as
to
presents
the
same
principle
holds
good
as
with
emotions
and
marks
of
tenderness
only
by
example
can
generous
instincts
be
provoked
above
all
the
child
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
things
which
he
immediately
gives
away
gifts
to
a
child
should
always
imply
a
personal
requital
for
work
or
sacrifice
in
order
to
secure
for
children
the
pleasure
of
giving
and
the
opportunity
of
obtaining
small
pleasures
and
enjoyments
as
well
as
of
replacing
property
of
their
own
or
of
others
which
they
may
have
destroyed
they
should
at
an
early
age
be
accustomed
to
perform
seriously
certain
household
duties
for
which
they
receive
some
small
remuneration
but
small
occasional
services
whether
volunteered
or
asked
for
by
others
should
never
be
rewarded
only
readiness
to
serve
without
payment
develops
the
joy
of
generosity
when
the
child
wants
to
give
away
something
people
should
not
make
a
presence
of
receiving
it
this
produces
the
false
conception
in
his
mind
that
the
pleasure
of
being
generous
can
be
had
for
nothing
at
every
step
the
child
should
be
allowed
to
meet
the
real
experiences
of
life
the
thorns
should
never
be
plucked
from
his
roses
this
is
what
is
least
understood
in
training
thus
we
see
reasonable
methods
constantly
failing
people
find
themselves
forced
to
afflictive
methods
which
stand
in
no
relation
with
the
realities
of
life
i
mean
above
all
what
are
still
called
means
of
education
instead
of
means
of
torture
blows
many
people
of
defend
blows
maintaining
that
they
are
milder
means
of
punishment
than
the
natural
consequences
of
an
act
that
blows
have
the
strongest
effect
on
the
memory
which
effect
becomes
permanent
through
association
of
ideas
but
what
kinds
of
association
is
it
not
with
physical
pain
and
shame
gradually
step
by
step
this
method
of
training
and
discipline
has
been
superseded
in
all
its
forms
the
movement
to
abolish
torture
imprisonment
and
corporal
punishment
failed
for
a
long
time
owing
to
the
conviction
that
they
were
indispensable
as
methods
of
discipline
but
the
child
people
answer
is
still
an
animal
he
must
be
brought
up
as
an
animal
those
who
talk
in
this
way
know
nothing
of
children
nor
of
animals
even
animals
can
be
trained
without
striking
them
but
they
can
only
be
trained
by
men
who
have
become
men
themselves
others
come
forward
with
the
doctrine
that
terror
and
pain
have
been
the
best
means
of
educating
mankind
so
the
child
must
pursue
the
same
road
as
humanity
this
is
an
utter
absurdity
we
should
also
on
this
theory
teach
our
children
as
a
natural
introduction
to
religion
to
practice
fetish
worship
if
the
child
is
to
reproduce
all
the
lower
development
stages
of
the
race
he
would
be
practically
depressed
beneath
the
level
which
he
has
reached
physiologically
and
psychologically
through
the
common
inheritance
of
the
race
if
we
have
abandoned
torture
and
painful
punishments
for
adults
while
they
are
retained
for
children
it
is
because
we
have
not
yet
seen
that
their
soul
life
so
far
as
a
greater
and
more
subtle
capacity
for
suffering
is
concerned
has
made
the
same
progress
as
that
of
adult
mankind
the
numerous
cases
of
child
suicide
in
the
last
decade
were
often
the
result
of
fear
of
corporal
punishment
or
have
taken
place
after
its
administration
both
soul
and
body
are
equally
affected
by
this
practice
where
this
is
not
the
result
blows
have
even
more
dangerous
consequences
they
tend
to
dull
still
further
the
feeling
of
shame
to
increase
the
brutality
or
cowardice
of
the
person
punished
i
once
heard
a
child
pointed
out
in
a
school
as
being
so
unruly
that
it
was
generally
agreed
he
would
be
benefited
by
a
flogging
then
it
was
discovered
that
his
father
flogging
at
home
had
made
him
what
he
was
if
statistics
were
prepared
of
ruined
sons
those
who
had
been
flogged
would
certainly
be
more
numerous
than
those
who
had
been
pampered
society
has
gradually
given
up
employing
retributive
punishments
because
people
have
seen
that
they
neither
awaken
the
feeling
of
guilt
nor
act
as
a
deterrent
but
on
the
contrary
retribution
applied
by
equal
to
equal
brutalises
the
ideas
of
right
hardens
the
temper
and
stimulates
the
victim
to
exercise
the
same
violence
towards
others
that
has
been
endured
by
himself
but
other
rules
are
applied
to
the
psychological
processes
of
the
child
when
a
child
strikes
his
small
sister
the
mother
strikes
him
and
believes
that
he
will
see
and
understand
the
difference
between
the
blows
he
gets
and
those
he
gives
that
he
will
see
that
the
one
is
a
just
punishment
and
the
other
vicious
conduct
but
the
child
is
a
sharp
logician
and
feels
that
the
action
is
just
the
same
although
the
mother
gives
it
a
different
name
corporal
punishment
was
long
ago
admirably
described
by
comenius
who
compared
an
educator
using
this
method
with
a
musician
striking
a
badly
tuned
instrument
with
his
fist
instead
of
using
his
ears
and
his
hands
to
put
it
into
tune
these
brutal
attacks
work
on
the
active
sensitive
feelings
lacerating
and
confusing
them
they
have
no
educative
power
on
all
the
innumerable
fine
processes
in
the
life
of
the
child
soul
on
their
obscurely
related
combinations
in
order
to
give
real
training
the
first
thing
after
the
second
or
third
year
is
to
abandon
the
very
thought
of
a
blow
among
the
possibilities
of
education
it
is
best
if
parents
as
soon
as
the
child
is
born
agree
never
to
strike
him
for
if
they
once
begin
with
this
convenient
and
easy
method
they
continue
to
use
corporal
discipline
even
contrary
to
their
first
intention
because
they
have
failed
while
using
such
punishment
to
develop
the
child
intelligence
if
people
do
not
see
this
it
is
no
more
use
to
speak
to
them
of
education
than
it
would
be
to
talk
to
a
cannibal
about
the
peace
but
as
these
savages
in
educational
matters
are
often
civilised
human
beings
in
other
respects
i
should
like
to
request
them
to
think
over
the
development
of
marriage
from
the
time
when
man
wooed
with
a
club
and
when
woman
was
regarded
as
the
soulless
property
of
man
only
to
be
kept
in
order
by
blows
a
view
which
continued
to
be
held
until
modern
times
through
a
thousand
daily
secret
influences
our
feelings
and
ideas
have
been
so
transformed
that
these
crude
conceptions
have
disappeared
to
the
great
advantage
of
society
and
the
individual
but
it
may
be
hard
to
awaken
a
pedagogical
savage
to
the
conviction
that
in
quite
the
same
way
a
thousand
new
secret
and
mighty
influences
will
change
our
crude
methods
of
education
when
parents
once
come
to
see
that
parenthood
must
go
through
the
same
transformation
as
marriage
before
it
attains
to
a
noble
and
complete
development
only
when
men
realise
that
whipping
a
child
belongs
to
the
same
low
stage
of
civilisation
as
beating
a
woman
or
a
servant
or
as
the
corporal
punishment
of
soldiers
and
criminals
will
the
first
real
preparation
begin
of
the
material
from
which
perhaps
later
an
educator
may
be
formed
corporal
punishment
was
natural
in
rough
times
the
body
is
tangible
what
affects
it
has
an
immediate
and
perceptible
result
the
heat
of
passion
is
cooled
by
the
blows
it
administers
in
a
certain
stage
of
development
blows
are
the
natural
expression
of
moral
indignation
the
direct
method
by
which
the
moral
will
impresses
itself
on
beings
of
lower
capacities
but
it
has
since
been
discovered
that
the
soul
may
be
impressed
by
spiritual
means
and
that
blows
are
just
as
demoralising
for
the
one
who
gives
them
as
for
the
one
who
receives
them
the
educator
too
is
apt
to
forget
that
the
child
in
many
cases
has
as
few
moral
conceptions
as
the
animal
or
the
savage
to
punish
for
this
is
only
a
cruelty
and
to
punish
by
brutal
methods
is
a
piece
of
stupidity
it
works
against
the
possibility
of
elevating
the
child
beyond
the
level
of
the
beast
or
the
savage
the
educator
to
whose
mind
flogging
never
presents
itself
even
as
an
occasional
resource
will
naturally
direct
his
whole
thought
to
finding
psychological
methods
of
education
administering
corporal
punishment
demoralises
and
stupefies
the
educator
for
it
increases
his
thoughtlessness
not
his
patience
his
brutality
not
his
intelligence
a
small
boy
friend
of
mine
when
four
years
old
received
his
first
punishment
of
this
kind
happily
it
was
his
only
one
as
his
nurse
reminded
him
in
the
evening
to
say
his
prayers
he
broke
out
yes
i
really
have
something
to
tell
god
and
prayed
with
deep
earnestness
dear
god
tear
mamma
arms
out
so
that
she
can
not
beat
me
any
more
nothing
would
more
effectively
further
the
development
of
education
than
for
all
flogging
pedagogues
to
meet
this
fate
they
would
then
learn
to
educate
with
the
head
instead
of
with
the
hand
and
as
to
public
educators
the
teachers
their
position
could
be
no
better
raised
than
by
legally
forbidding
a
blow
to
be
administered
in
any
school
under
penalty
of
final
loss
of
position
that
people
who
are
in
other
respects
intelligent
and
sensitive
continue
to
defend
flogging
is
due
to
the
fact
that
most
educators
have
only
a
very
elementary
conception
of
their
work
they
should
constantly
keep
before
them
the
feelings
and
impressions
of
their
own
childhood
in
dealing
with
children
the
most
frequent
as
well
as
the
most
dangerous
of
the
numerous
mistakes
made
in
handling
children
is
that
people
do
not
remember
how
they
felt
themselves
at
a
similar
age
that
they
do
not
regard
and
comprehend
the
feelings
of
the
child
from
their
own
past
point
of
view
the
adult
laughs
or
smiles
in
remembering
the
punishments
and
other
things
which
caused
him
in
his
childhood
anxious
days
or
nights
which
produced
the
silent
torture
of
the
child
heart
infinite
despondency
burning
indignation
lonely
fears
outraged
sense
of
justice
the
terrible
creations
of
his
imagination
his
absurd
shame
his
unsatisfied
thirst
for
joy
freedom
and
tenderness
lacking
these
beneficent
memories
adults
constantly
repeat
the
crime
of
destroying
the
childhood
of
the
new
generation
the
only
time
in
life
in
which
the
guardian
of
education
can
really
be
a
kindly
providence
so
strongly
do
i
feel
that
the
unnecessary
sufferings
of
children
are
unnatural
as
well
as
ignoble
that
i
experience
physical
disgust
in
touching
the
hand
of
a
human
being
that
i
know
has
struck
a
child
and
i
can
not
close
my
eyes
after
i
have
heard
a
child
in
the
street
threatened
with
corporal
punishment
blows
call
forth
the
virtues
of
slaves
not
those
of
freemen
as
early
as
walther
von
der
vogelweide
it
was
known
that
the
honourable
man
respects
a
word
more
than
a
blow
the
exercise
of
physical
force
delivers
the
weak
and
unprotected
into
the
hands
of
the
strong
a
child
never
believes
in
his
heart
though
he
may
be
brought
to
acknowledge
verbally
that
the
blows
were
due
to
love
that
they
were
administered
because
they
were
necessary
the
child
is
too
keen
not
to
know
that
such
a
must
does
not
exist
and
that
love
can
express
itself
in
a
better
way
lack
of
of
intelligence
of
patience
of
personal
effort
these
are
the
on
which
corporal
punishment
rests
i
do
not
now
refer
to
the
system
of
flogging
employed
by
miserable
people
year
in
and
year
out
at
home
or
particularly
in
schools
that
of
beating
children
outrageously
or
to
the
limits
of
brutality
i
do
not
mean
even
the
less
brutal
blows
administered
by
undisciplined
teachers
and
parents
who
avenge
themselves
in
excesses
of
passion
or
fatigue
or
disgust
blows
which
are
simply
the
active
expression
of
a
tension
of
nerves
a
detestable
evidence
of
the
want
of
and
selfculture
still
less
do
i
refer
to
the
cruelties
committed
by
monsters
sexual
perverts
whose
brutal
tendencies
are
stimulated
by
their
disciplinary
power
and
who
use
it
to
force
their
victims
to
silence
as
certain
criminal
trials
have
shown
i
am
only
speaking
of
conscientious
amiable
parents
and
teachers
who
with
pain
to
themselves
fulfil
what
they
regard
as
their
duty
to
the
child
these
are
accustomed
to
adduce
the
good
effects
of
corporal
discipline
as
a
proof
that
it
can
not
be
dispensed
with
the
child
by
being
whipped
is
they
say
not
only
made
good
but
freed
from
his
evil
character
and
shows
by
his
whole
being
that
this
quick
and
summary
method
of
punishment
has
done
more
than
talks
and
patience
and
the
slowly
working
penalties
of
experience
examples
are
adduced
to
prove
that
only
this
kind
of
punishment
breaks
down
obstinacy
cures
the
habit
of
lying
and
the
like
those
who
adopt
this
system
do
not
perceive
that
they
have
only
succeeded
through
this
momentarily
effective
means
in
repressing
the
external
expression
of
an
evil
will
they
have
not
succeeded
in
transforming
the
will
itself
it
requires
constant
vigilance
daily
to
create
an
ever
higher
capacity
for
the
discovery
of
intelligent
methods
the
fault
that
is
repressed
is
certain
to
appear
on
every
occasion
when
the
child
dares
to
show
it
the
educator
who
finds
in
corporal
punishment
a
short
way
to
get
rid
of
trouble
leads
the
child
a
long
way
round
if
we
have
the
only
real
development
in
view
namely
that
which
gradually
strengthens
the
capacity
for
i
have
never
heard
a
child
over
three
years
old
threatened
with
corporal
punishment
without
noticing
that
this
wonderfully
moral
method
had
an
equally
bad
influence
on
parents
and
children
the
same
can
be
said
of
milder
kinds
of
folly
coaxing
children
by
external
rewards
i
have
seen
some
children
coaxed
to
take
baths
and
others
compelled
by
threats
but
in
neither
case
was
their
courage
or
or
strength
of
will
increased
only
when
one
is
able
to
make
the
bath
itself
attractive
is
that
energy
of
will
developed
that
gains
a
victory
over
the
feeling
of
fear
or
discomfort
and
produces
a
real
ethical
impression
that
virtue
is
its
own
reward
wherever
a
child
is
deterred
from
a
bad
habit
or
fault
by
corporal
punishment
a
real
ethical
result
is
not
reached
the
child
has
only
learnt
to
fear
an
unpleasant
consequence
which
lacks
real
connection
with
the
thing
itself
a
consequence
it
well
knows
could
have
been
absent
such
fear
is
as
far
removed
as
heaven
from
the
conviction
that
the
good
is
better
than
the
bad
the
child
soon
becomes
convinced
that
the
disagreeable
accompaniment
is
no
necessary
result
of
the
action
that
by
greater
cleverness
the
punishment
might
have
been
avoided
thus
the
physical
punishment
increases
deception
not
morality
in
the
history
of
humanity
the
effect
of
the
teaching
about
hell
and
fear
of
hell
illustrates
the
sort
of
morality
produced
in
souls
by
corporal
punishment
that
inferno
of
childhood
only
with
the
greatest
trouble
slowly
and
unconsciously
is
the
conviction
of
the
superiority
of
the
good
established
the
good
comes
to
be
seen
as
more
productive
of
happiness
to
the
individual
himself
and
his
environment
so
the
child
learns
to
love
the
good
by
teaching
the
child
that
punishment
is
a
consequence
drawn
upon
oneself
he
learns
to
avoid
the
cause
of
punishment
despite
all
the
new
talk
of
individuality
the
greatest
mistake
in
training
children
is
still
that
of
treating
the
child
as
an
abstract
conception
as
an
inorganic
or
personal
material
to
be
formed
and
transformed
by
the
hands
of
those
who
are
educating
him
he
is
beaten
and
it
is
thought
that
the
whole
effect
of
the
blow
stops
at
the
moment
when
the
child
is
prevented
from
being
bad
he
has
it
is
thought
a
powerful
reminder
against
future
bad
behaviour
people
no
not
suspect
that
this
violent
interference
in
the
physical
and
psychical
life
of
the
child
may
have
lifelong
effects
as
far
back
as
forty
years
ago
a
writer
showed
that
corporal
punishment
had
the
most
powerful
somatic
stimulative
effects
the
flagellation
of
the
middle
ages
is
known
to
have
had
such
results
and
if
i
could
publish
what
i
have
heard
from
adults
as
to
the
effect
of
corporal
punishment
on
them
or
what
i
have
observed
in
children
this
alone
would
be
decisive
in
doing
away
with
such
punishment
in
its
crudest
form
it
very
deeply
influences
the
personal
modesty
of
the
child
this
should
be
preserved
above
everything
as
the
main
factor
in
the
development
of
the
feeling
of
purity
the
father
who
punishes
his
daughter
in
this
way
deserves
to
see
her
some
day
a
fallen
woman
he
injures
her
instinctive
feeling
of
the
sanctity
of
her
body
an
instinct
which
even
in
the
case
of
a
small
child
can
be
passionately
profound
only
when
every
infringement
of
sanctity
forcible
caressing
is
as
bad
as
a
blow
evokes
an
energetic
instinctive
repulsion
is
the
nature
of
the
child
proud
and
pure
children
who
strike
back
when
they
are
punished
have
the
most
promising
characters
of
all
numerous
are
the
cases
in
which
bodily
punishment
can
occasion
irremediable
damage
not
suspected
by
the
person
who
administers
it
though
he
may
triumphantly
declare
how
the
punishment
in
the
specific
case
has
helped
most
adults
feel
free
to
tell
how
a
whipping
has
injured
them
in
one
way
or
another
but
when
they
take
up
the
training
of
their
own
children
they
depend
on
the
effect
of
such
chastisement
what
burning
bitterness
and
desire
for
vengeance
what
canine
fawning
flattery
does
not
corporal
punishment
call
forth
it
makes
the
lazy
lazier
the
obstinate
more
obstinate
the
hard
harder
it
strengthens
those
two
emotions
the
root
of
almost
all
evil
in
the
world
hatred
and
fear
and
as
long
as
blows
are
made
synonymous
with
education
both
of
these
emotions
will
keep
their
mastery
over
men
one
of
the
most
frequent
occasions
for
recourse
to
this
punishment
is
obstinacy
but
what
is
called
obstinacy
is
only
fear
or
incapacity
the
child
repeats
a
false
answer
is
threatened
with
blows
and
again
repeats
it
just
because
he
is
afraid
not
to
say
the
right
thing
he
is
struck
and
then
answers
rightly
this
is
a
triumph
of
education
refractoriness
is
overcome
but
what
has
happened
increased
fear
has
led
to
a
strong
effort
of
thought
to
a
momentary
increase
of
the
next
day
the
child
will
very
likely
repeat
the
fault
where
there
is
real
obstinacy
on
the
part
of
children
i
know
of
cases
when
corporal
punishment
has
filled
them
with
the
lust
to
kill
either
themselves
or
the
person
who
strikes
them
on
the
other
hand
i
know
of
others
where
a
mother
has
brought
an
obstinate
child
to
repentance
and
by
holding
him
quietly
and
calmly
on
her
knees
how
many
untrue
confessions
have
been
forced
by
fear
of
blows
how
much
daring
passion
for
action
spirit
of
adventure
play
of
fancy
and
stimulus
to
discovery
has
been
repressed
by
this
same
fear
even
where
blows
do
not
cause
lying
they
always
hinder
absolute
straightforwardness
and
the
personal
courage
to
show
oneself
as
one
is
as
long
as
the
word
blow
is
used
at
all
in
a
home
no
perfect
honour
will
be
found
in
children
so
long
as
the
home
and
the
school
use
this
method
of
education
brutality
will
be
developed
in
the
child
himself
at
the
cost
of
humanity
the
child
uses
on
animals
on
his
young
brothers
and
sisters
on
his
comrades
the
methods
applied
to
himself
he
puts
in
practice
the
same
argument
that
badness
must
be
cured
with
blows
only
children
accustomed
to
be
treated
mildly
learn
to
see
that
influence
can
be
gained
without
using
force
to
see
this
is
one
of
man
privileges
sacrificed
by
man
through
descending
to
the
methods
of
the
brute
only
by
the
child
seeing
his
teacher
always
and
everywhere
abstaining
from
the
use
of
actual
force
will
he
come
himself
to
despise
force
on
all
those
occasions
which
do
not
involve
the
defence
of
a
weaker
person
against
physical
superiority
the
foundation
of
the
desire
for
war
is
to
be
sought
for
less
in
the
war
games
than
in
the
teachers
rod
to
defend
corporal
discipline
children
own
statements
are
brought
in
evidence
they
are
reported
as
saying
they
knew
they
deserved
such
discipline
in
order
to
be
made
good
there
is
no
lower
example
of
hypocrisy
in
human
nature
than
this
it
is
true
the
child
may
be
sincere
in
other
cases
in
saying
that
he
feels
that
through
punishment
he
has
atoned
for
a
fault
which
was
weighing
upon
his
conscience
but
this
is
really
the
foundation
of
a
false
system
of
ethics
the
kind
which
still
continues
to
be
preached
as
christian
namely
that
a
fault
may
be
atoned
for
by
sufferings
which
are
not
directly
connected
with
the
fault
the
basis
of
the
new
morality
is
just
the
opposite
as
i
have
already
shown
it
teaches
that
no
fault
can
be
atoned
for
that
no
one
can
escape
the
results
of
his
actions
in
any
way
untruthfulness
belongs
to
the
faults
which
the
teacher
thinks
he
must
most
frequently
punish
with
blows
but
there
is
no
case
in
which
this
method
is
more
dangerous
when
the
for
parents
is
published
the
story
of
george
washington
and
the
hatchet
must
appear
in
it
accompanied
by
the
remark
which
a
clever
child
added
to
the
anecdote
it
is
no
trouble
telling
the
truth
when
one
has
such
a
kind
father
i
formerly
divided
untruthfulness
into
unwilling
shameless
and
imaginative
lies
a
short
time
ago
i
ran
across
a
much
better
division
of
lying
first
cold
lies
that
is
fully
conscious
untruthfulness
which
must
be
punished
and
hot
lies
the
expression
of
an
excited
temperament
or
of
a
vigorous
fancy
i
agree
with
the
author
of
this
distinction
that
the
last
should
not
be
punished
but
corrected
though
not
with
a
pedantic
rule
of
thumb
measure
based
on
how
much
it
exceeds
or
falls
short
of
truth
it
is
to
be
cured
by
ridicule
a
dangerous
method
of
education
in
general
but
useful
when
one
observes
that
this
type
of
untruthfulness
threatens
to
develop
into
real
untrustworthiness
in
dealing
with
these
faults
we
are
very
strict
towards
children
so
strict
that
no
lawyer
no
politician
no
journalist
no
poet
could
exercise
his
profession
if
the
same
standard
were
applied
to
them
as
to
children
the
white
lie
is
as
a
french
scientist
has
shown
partly
caused
by
pure
morbidness
partly
through
some
defect
in
the
conception
it
is
due
to
an
empty
space
a
dead
point
in
memory
or
in
consciousness
that
produces
a
defective
idea
or
gives
one
no
idea
at
all
of
what
has
happened
in
the
affairs
of
everyday
life
the
adults
are
often
mistaken
as
to
their
intentions
or
acts
they
may
have
forgotten
about
their
actions
and
it
requires
a
strong
effort
of
memory
to
call
them
back
into
their
minds
or
they
suggest
to
themselves
that
they
have
done
or
not
done
something
in
all
of
these
cases
if
they
were
forced
to
give
a
distinct
answer
they
would
lie
in
every
case
of
this
kind
where
a
child
is
concerned
the
lie
is
assumed
to
be
a
conscious
one
and
when
on
being
submitted
to
a
strict
he
hesitates
becomes
confused
and
blushes
it
is
looked
upon
as
a
proof
that
he
knows
he
has
been
telling
an
untruth
although
as
a
rule
there
has
been
no
instance
of
untruthfulness
except
the
finally
extorted
confession
from
the
child
that
he
has
lied
yet
in
all
these
complicated
psychological
problems
corporal
punishment
is
treated
as
a
solution
the
child
who
never
hears
lying
at
home
who
does
not
see
exaggerated
weight
placed
on
small
merely
external
things
who
is
not
made
cowardly
by
fear
who
hears
conscious
lies
always
spoken
of
with
contempt
will
get
out
of
the
habit
of
untruthfulness
simply
by
psychological
means
first
he
will
find
that
untruthfulness
causes
astonishment
and
a
repetition
of
it
scorn
and
lack
of
confidence
but
these
methods
should
not
be
applied
to
untruthfulness
caused
by
distress
or
by
richness
of
imagination
or
to
such
cases
as
originate
from
the
obscure
mental
ideas
noted
above
ideas
whose
connection
with
one
another
the
child
can
not
make
clear
to
himself
the
cold
untruth
on
the
other
hand
must
be
punished
first
by
going
over
it
with
the
child
then
letting
him
experience
its
effect
in
lack
of
confidence
which
will
only
be
restored
when
the
child
shows
decided
improvement
in
this
regard
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
show
children
full
and
unlimited
confidence
even
though
one
quietly
maintains
an
attitude
of
alert
watchfulness
for
continuous
and
undeserved
mistrust
is
just
as
demoralising
as
blind
and
easy
confidence
no
one
who
has
been
beaten
for
lying
learns
by
it
to
love
truth
the
accuracy
of
this
principle
is
illustrated
by
adults
who
despise
corporal
punishment
in
their
childhood
yet
continue
to
tell
untruths
by
word
and
deed
fear
may
keep
the
child
from
technical
untruth
but
fear
also
produces
untrustworthiness
those
who
have
been
beaten
in
childhood
for
lying
have
often
suffered
a
serious
injury
immeasurably
greater
than
the
direct
lie
the
truest
men
i
ever
knew
lie
voluntarily
and
involuntarily
while
others
who
might
never
be
caught
in
a
lie
are
thoroughly
false
this
corruption
of
personality
begins
frequently
at
the
tenderest
age
under
the
influence
of
early
training
children
are
given
untrue
motives
information
are
threatened
admonished
the
will
thought
and
feeling
are
oppressed
against
this
treatment
dishonesty
is
the
readiest
method
of
defence
in
this
way
educators
who
make
truth
their
highest
aim
make
children
untruthful
i
watched
a
child
who
was
severely
punished
for
denying
something
he
had
unconsciously
done
and
noted
how
under
the
influence
of
this
senseless
punishment
he
developed
extreme
dissimulation
truthfulness
requires
above
everything
unbroken
determination
and
many
nervous
little
liars
need
nourishing
food
and
life
in
the
open
air
not
blows
a
great
artist
one
of
the
few
who
live
wholly
according
to
the
modern
principles
of
life
said
to
me
on
one
occasion
my
son
does
not
know
what
a
lie
is
nor
what
a
blow
is
his
on
the
other
hand
lied
when
he
came
into
our
house
but
lying
did
not
work
in
the
atmosphere
of
calm
and
freedom
after
a
year
the
habit
disappeared
by
itself
only
because
it
always
met
with
deep
astonishment
this
makes
me
in
passing
note
one
of
the
other
many
mistakes
of
education
the
infinite
trouble
taken
in
trying
to
do
away
with
a
fault
which
disappears
by
itself
people
take
infinite
pains
to
teach
small
children
to
speak
distinctly
who
if
left
to
themselves
would
learn
it
by
themselves
provided
they
were
always
spoken
to
distinctly
this
same
principle
holds
good
of
numerous
other
things
in
attitude
and
behaviour
that
can
be
left
simply
to
a
good
example
and
to
time
one
influence
should
be
used
in
impressing
upon
the
child
habits
for
which
a
foundation
must
be
laid
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
life
there
is
another
still
more
unfortunate
mistake
the
mistake
of
correcting
and
judging
by
an
external
effect
produced
by
the
act
by
the
scandal
it
occasions
in
the
environment
children
are
struck
for
using
oaths
and
improper
words
the
meaning
of
which
they
do
not
understand
or
if
they
do
understand
the
result
of
strictness
is
only
that
they
go
on
keeping
silence
in
matters
in
which
sincerity
towards
those
who
are
bringing
them
up
is
of
the
highest
importance
the
very
thing
the
child
is
allowed
to
do
uncorrected
at
home
is
not
seldom
corrected
if
it
happens
away
from
home
so
the
child
gets
a
false
idea
that
it
is
not
the
thing
that
deserves
punishment
but
its
publicity
when
a
mother
is
ashamed
of
the
bad
behaviour
of
her
son
she
is
apt
to
strike
him
instead
of
striking
her
own
breast
when
an
adventurous
feat
fails
he
is
beaten
but
he
is
praised
when
successful
these
practices
produce
demoralisation
once
in
a
wood
i
saw
two
parents
laughing
while
the
ice
held
on
which
their
son
was
sliding
when
it
broke
suddenly
they
threatened
to
whip
him
it
required
strong
in
order
not
to
say
to
this
pair
that
it
was
not
the
son
who
deserved
punishment
but
themselves
on
occasions
like
these
parents
avenge
their
own
fright
on
their
children
i
saw
a
child
become
a
coward
because
an
anxious
mother
struck
him
every
time
he
fell
down
while
the
natural
result
inflicted
on
the
child
would
have
been
more
than
sufficient
to
increase
his
carefulness
when
misfortune
is
caused
by
disobedience
natural
alarm
is
as
a
rule
enough
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
it
if
it
is
not
sufficient
blows
have
no
restraining
effect
they
only
embitter
the
boy
finds
that
adults
have
forgotten
their
own
period
of
childhood
he
withdraws
himself
secretly
from
this
abuse
of
power
provided
strict
treatment
does
not
succeed
in
totally
depressing
the
level
of
the
child
will
and
obstructing
his
energies
this
is
certainly
a
danger
but
the
most
serious
effect
of
corporal
punishment
is
that
it
has
established
an
unethical
morality
as
its
result
until
the
human
being
has
learnt
to
see
that
effort
striving
development
of
power
are
their
own
reward
life
remains
an
unbeautiful
affair
the
debasing
effects
of
vanity
and
ambition
the
small
and
great
cruelties
produced
by
injustice
are
all
due
to
the
idea
that
failure
or
success
sets
the
value
to
deeds
and
actions
a
complete
revolution
in
this
crude
theory
of
value
must
come
about
before
the
earth
can
become
the
scene
of
a
happy
but
considerate
development
of
power
on
the
part
of
free
and
fine
human
beings
every
contest
decided
by
examinations
and
prizes
is
ultimately
an
immoral
method
of
training
it
awakens
only
evil
passions
envy
and
the
impression
of
injustice
on
the
one
side
arrogance
on
the
other
after
i
had
during
the
course
of
twenty
years
fought
these
school
examinations
i
read
with
thorough
agreement
a
short
time
ago
ruskin
views
on
the
subject
he
believed
that
all
competition
was
a
false
basis
of
stimulus
and
every
distribution
of
prizes
a
false
means
he
thought
that
the
real
sign
of
talent
in
a
boy
auspicious
for
his
future
career
was
his
desire
to
work
for
work
sake
he
declared
that
the
real
aim
of
instruction
should
be
to
show
him
his
own
proper
and
special
gifts
to
strengthen
them
in
him
not
to
spur
him
on
to
an
empty
competition
with
those
who
were
plainly
his
superiors
in
capacity
moreover
it
ought
not
to
be
forgotten
that
success
and
failure
involve
of
themselves
their
own
punishment
and
their
own
reward
the
one
bitter
the
other
sweet
enough
to
secure
in
a
natural
way
increased
strength
care
prudence
and
endurance
it
is
completely
unnecessary
for
the
educator
to
use
besides
these
some
special
punishments
or
special
rewards
and
so
pervert
the
conceptions
of
the
child
that
failure
seems
to
him
to
be
a
wrong
success
on
the
other
hand
as
the
right
no
matter
where
one
turns
one
gaze
it
is
notorious
that
the
externally
encouraging
or
means
of
education
are
an
obstacle
to
what
are
the
chief
human
characteristics
courage
in
oneself
and
goodness
to
others
a
people
whose
education
is
carried
on
by
gentle
means
only
i
mean
the
people
of
japan
have
shown
that
manliness
is
not
in
danger
where
children
are
not
hardened
by
corporal
punishment
these
gentle
means
are
just
as
effective
in
calling
forth
selfmastery
and
consideration
these
virtues
are
so
imprinted
on
children
at
the
tenderest
age
that
one
learns
first
in
japan
what
attraction
considerate
kindliness
bestows
upon
life
in
a
country
where
blows
are
never
seen
the
first
rule
of
social
intercourse
is
not
to
cause
discomfort
to
others
it
is
told
that
when
a
foreigner
in
japan
took
up
a
stone
to
throw
it
at
a
dog
the
dog
did
not
run
no
one
had
ever
thrown
a
stone
at
him
tenderness
towards
animals
is
the
complement
in
that
country
of
tenderness
in
human
relationship
a
tenderness
whose
result
is
observed
among
other
effects
in
a
relatively
small
number
of
crimes
against
life
and
security
war
hunting
for
pleasure
corporal
discipline
are
nothing
more
than
different
expressions
of
the
tiger
nature
still
alive
in
man
when
the
rod
is
thrown
away
and
when
as
some
one
has
said
children
are
no
longer
boxed
on
their
ears
but
are
given
magnifying
glasses
and
photographic
cameras
to
increase
their
capacity
for
life
and
for
loving
it
instead
of
learning
to
destroy
it
real
education
in
humanity
will
begin
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
convinced
that
corporal
punishment
can
be
dispensed
with
in
a
manly
education
by
so
remote
and
so
distant
an
example
as
japan
i
should
like
to
mention
a
fact
closer
to
us
our
germanic
forefathers
did
not
have
this
method
of
education
it
was
introduced
with
christianity
corporal
discipline
was
turned
into
a
religious
duty
and
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
there
were
intelligent
men
who
flogged
their
children
once
a
week
as
a
part
of
spiritual
guardianship
i
once
asked
our
great
poet
victor
rydberg
and
he
said
that
he
had
found
no
proof
that
corporal
punishment
was
usual
among
the
germans
in
heathen
times
i
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
believe
that
the
fact
of
its
absence
had
encouraged
the
energetic
individualism
and
manliness
in
the
northern
peoples
he
thought
so
and
agreed
with
me
finally
i
might
note
from
our
own
time
that
there
are
many
families
and
schools
our
girls
schools
for
example
and
also
boys
schools
in
some
countries
where
corporal
punishment
is
never
used
i
know
a
family
with
twelve
children
whose
activity
and
capacity
are
not
damaged
by
bringing
them
under
the
rule
of
duty
alone
corporal
punishment
is
never
used
in
this
home
a
determined
but
mild
mother
has
taught
the
children
to
obey
voluntarily
and
has
known
how
to
train
their
wills
to
by
voluntary
obedience
i
do
not
mean
that
the
child
is
bound
to
ask
endless
questions
for
reasons
and
to
dispute
them
before
he
obeys
a
good
teacher
never
gives
a
command
without
there
being
some
good
reason
but
whether
the
child
is
convinced
or
not
he
must
always
obey
and
if
he
asks
why
the
answer
is
very
simple
every
one
adults
as
well
as
children
must
obey
the
right
and
must
submit
to
what
can
not
be
avoided
the
great
necessity
in
life
must
be
imprinted
in
childhood
this
can
be
done
without
harsh
means
by
training
the
child
even
previous
to
his
birth
by
cultivating
one
and
after
his
birth
by
never
giving
in
to
a
child
caprices
the
rule
is
in
a
few
cases
to
work
in
opposition
to
the
action
of
the
child
but
in
other
cases
work
constructively
i
mean
provide
the
child
with
material
to
construct
his
own
personality
and
then
let
him
do
this
work
of
construction
this
is
in
brief
the
art
of
education
the
worst
of
all
educational
methods
are
threats
the
only
effective
admonitions
are
short
and
infrequent
ones
the
greatest
skill
in
the
educator
is
to
be
silent
for
the
moment
and
then
so
reprove
the
fault
indirectly
that
the
child
is
brought
to
correct
himself
or
make
himself
the
object
of
blame
this
can
be
done
by
the
instructor
telling
something
that
causes
the
child
to
compare
his
own
conduct
with
the
hateful
or
admirable
types
of
behaviour
about
which
he
hears
information
or
the
educator
may
give
an
opinion
which
the
child
must
take
to
himself
although
it
is
not
applied
directly
to
him
on
many
occasions
a
forceful
display
of
indignation
on
the
part
of
the
elder
person
is
an
excellent
punishment
if
the
indignation
is
reserved
for
the
right
moment
i
know
children
to
whom
nothing
was
more
frightful
than
their
father
scorn
this
was
dreaded
children
who
are
deluged
with
directions
and
religious
devotions
who
receive
an
ounce
of
morality
in
every
cup
of
joy
are
most
certain
to
be
those
who
will
revolt
against
all
this
nearly
every
thinking
person
feels
that
the
deepest
educational
influences
in
his
life
have
been
indirect
some
good
advice
not
given
to
him
directly
a
noble
deed
told
without
any
direct
reference
but
when
people
come
themselves
to
train
others
they
forget
all
their
own
personal
experience
the
strongest
constructive
factor
in
the
education
of
a
human
being
is
the
settled
quiet
order
of
home
its
peace
and
its
duty
industry
straightforwardness
at
home
develop
goodness
desire
to
work
and
simplicity
in
the
child
examples
of
artistic
work
and
books
in
the
home
its
customary
life
on
ordinary
days
and
holidays
its
occupations
and
its
pleasures
should
give
to
the
emotions
and
imagination
of
the
child
periods
of
movement
and
repose
a
sure
contour
and
a
rich
colour
the
pure
warm
clear
atmosphere
in
which
father
mother
and
children
live
together
in
freedom
and
confidence
where
none
are
kept
isolated
from
the
interests
of
the
others
but
each
possesses
full
freedom
for
his
own
personal
interest
where
none
trenches
on
the
rights
of
others
where
all
are
willing
to
help
one
another
when
necessary
in
this
atmosphere
egoism
as
well
as
altruism
can
attain
their
richest
development
and
individuality
find
its
just
freedom
as
the
evolution
of
man
soul
advances
to
possibilities
of
refinement
of
capacity
of
profundity
as
the
spiritual
life
of
the
generation
becomes
more
manifold
in
its
combinations
and
in
its
distinctions
the
more
time
one
has
for
observing
the
wonderful
and
deep
secrets
of
existence
behind
the
visible
tangible
world
of
sense
the
more
will
each
new
generation
of
children
show
a
more
refined
and
a
more
consistent
mental
life
it
is
impossible
to
attain
this
result
under
the
torture
of
the
crude
methods
in
our
present
home
and
school
training
we
need
new
homes
new
schools
new
marriages
new
social
relations
for
those
new
souls
who
are
to
feel
love
and
suffer
in
ways
infinitely
numerous
that
we
now
can
not
even
name
thus
they
will
come
to
understand
life
they
will
have
aspirations
and
hopes
they
will
believe
they
will
pray
the
conceptions
of
religion
love
and
art
all
these
must
be
revolutionised
so
radically
that
one
now
can
only
surmise
what
new
forms
will
be
created
in
future
generations
this
transformation
can
be
helped
by
the
training
of
the
present
by
casting
aside
the
withered
foliage
which
now
covers
the
budding
possibilities
of
life
the
house
must
once
more
become
a
home
for
the
souls
of
children
not
for
their
bodies
alone
for
such
homes
to
be
formed
that
in
their
turn
will
mould
children
the
children
must
be
given
back
to
the
home
instead
of
the
study
preparation
at
home
for
the
school
taking
up
as
it
now
does
the
best
part
of
a
child
life
the
school
must
get
the
smaller
part
the
home
the
larger
part
the
home
will
have
the
responsibility
of
so
using
the
free
time
as
well
on
ordinary
days
as
on
holidays
that
the
children
will
really
become
a
part
of
the
home
both
in
their
work
and
in
their
pleasures
the
children
will
be
taken
from
the
school
the
street
the
factory
and
restored
to
the
home
the
mother
will
be
given
back
from
work
outside
or
from
social
life
to
the
children
thus
natural
training
in
the
spirit
of
rousseau
and
spencer
will
be
realised
a
training
for
life
by
life
at
home
such
was
the
training
of
old
scandinavia
the
direct
share
of
the
child
in
the
work
of
the
adult
in
real
labours
and
dangers
gave
to
the
life
of
our
scandinavian
forefathers
with
whom
the
boy
began
to
be
a
man
at
twelve
years
of
age
unity
character
and
strength
things
specially
made
for
children
the
anxious
watching
over
all
their
undertakings
support
given
to
all
their
steps
courses
of
work
and
pleasure
specially
prepared
for
children
these
are
the
fundamental
defects
of
our
present
day
education
an
girl
said
to
me
a
short
time
ago
that
she
and
other
girls
of
the
same
age
were
so
tired
of
the
system
of
vigilance
protection
amusement
and
pampering
at
school
and
at
home
that
they
were
determined
to
bring
up
their
own
children
in
hunger
corporal
discipline
and
drudgery
one
can
understand
this
unfortunate
reaction
against
an
artificial
environment
the
environment
in
which
children
and
young
people
of
the
present
grow
up
an
existence
that
evokes
a
passionate
desire
for
the
realities
of
life
for
individual
action
at
one
own
risk
and
responsibility
instead
of
being
as
is
now
the
case
at
home
and
in
the
school
the
object
of
another
care
what
is
required
above
all
for
the
children
of
the
present
day
is
to
be
assigned
again
real
home
occupations
tasks
they
must
do
conscientiously
habits
of
work
arranged
for
week
days
and
holidays
without
oversight
in
every
case
where
the
child
can
help
himself
instead
of
the
modern
school
child
having
a
mother
and
servants
about
him
to
get
him
ready
for
school
and
to
help
him
to
remember
things
he
should
have
time
every
day
before
school
to
arrange
his
room
and
brush
his
clothes
and
there
should
be
no
effort
to
make
him
remember
what
is
connected
with
the
school
the
home
and
the
school
should
combine
together
systematically
to
let
the
child
suffer
for
the
results
of
his
own
negligence
just
the
reverse
of
this
system
rules
mothers
learn
their
children
lessons
invent
plays
for
them
read
their
story
books
to
them
arrange
their
rooms
after
them
pick
up
what
they
have
let
fall
put
in
order
the
things
they
have
left
in
confusion
and
in
this
and
in
other
ways
by
protective
pampering
and
attention
their
desire
for
work
their
endurance
the
gifts
of
invention
and
imagination
qualities
proper
to
the
child
become
weak
and
passive
the
home
now
is
only
a
preparation
for
school
in
it
young
people
growing
up
are
accustomed
to
receive
services
without
performing
any
on
their
part
they
are
trained
to
be
always
receptive
instead
of
giving
something
in
return
then
people
are
surprised
at
a
youthful
generation
selfish
and
unrestrained
pressing
forward
shamelessly
on
all
occasions
before
their
elders
crudely
unresponsive
in
respect
of
those
attentions
which
in
earlier
generations
were
a
beautiful
custom
among
the
young
to
restore
this
custom
all
the
means
usually
adopted
now
to
protect
the
child
from
physical
and
psychical
dangers
and
inconveniences
will
have
to
be
removed
throw
the
thermometer
out
of
the
window
and
begin
with
a
sensible
course
of
toughening
teach
the
child
to
know
and
to
bear
natural
pain
corporal
punishment
must
be
done
away
with
not
because
it
is
painful
but
because
it
is
profoundly
immoral
and
hopelessly
unsuitable
repress
the
egoistic
demands
of
the
child
when
he
interferes
with
the
work
or
rest
of
others
never
let
him
either
by
caresses
or
by
nagging
usurp
the
rights
of
grown
people
take
care
that
the
servants
do
not
work
against
what
the
parents
are
trying
to
insist
on
in
this
and
in
other
matters
we
must
begin
in
doing
for
the
child
in
certain
ways
a
thousand
times
more
and
in
others
a
hundred
thousand
times
less
a
beginning
must
be
made
in
the
tenderest
age
to
establish
the
child
feeling
for
nature
let
him
live
year
in
and
year
out
in
the
same
country
home
this
is
one
of
the
most
significant
and
profound
factors
in
training
it
can
be
held
to
even
where
it
is
now
neglected
the
same
thing
holds
good
of
making
a
choice
library
commencing
with
the
first
years
of
life
so
that
the
child
will
have
at
different
periods
of
his
life
suitable
books
for
each
age
not
as
is
now
often
the
case
get
quite
spoilt
by
the
constant
change
of
summer
excursions
by
worthless
children
books
and
costly
toys
they
should
never
have
any
but
the
simplest
books
the
classical
ones
they
should
be
amply
provided
with
means
of
preparing
their
own
playthings
the
worst
feature
of
our
system
are
the
playthings
which
imitate
the
luxury
of
grown
people
by
such
objects
the
covetous
impulse
of
the
child
for
acquisition
is
increased
his
own
capacity
for
discovery
and
imagination
limited
or
rather
it
would
be
limited
if
children
with
the
sound
instinct
of
preservation
did
not
happily
smash
the
perfect
playthings
which
give
them
no
creative
opportunity
and
themselves
make
new
playthings
from
fir
cones
acorns
thorns
and
fragments
of
pottery
and
all
other
sorts
of
rubbish
which
can
be
transformed
into
objects
of
great
price
by
the
power
of
the
imagination
to
play
with
children
in
the
right
way
is
also
a
great
art
it
should
never
be
done
if
children
do
not
themselves
know
what
they
are
going
to
do
it
should
always
be
a
special
treat
for
them
as
well
as
their
elders
but
the
adults
must
always
on
such
occasions
leave
behind
every
kind
of
educational
idea
and
go
completely
into
the
child
world
of
thought
and
imagination
no
attempt
should
be
made
to
teach
them
at
these
times
anything
else
but
the
old
satisfactory
games
the
experiences
derived
from
these
games
about
the
nature
of
the
children
who
are
stimulated
in
one
direction
or
another
by
the
game
must
be
kept
for
later
use
games
in
this
way
increase
confidence
between
children
and
adults
they
learn
to
know
their
elders
better
but
to
allow
children
to
turn
all
the
rooms
into
places
to
play
in
and
to
demand
constantly
that
their
elders
shall
interest
themselves
in
them
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
species
of
pampering
common
to
the
present
day
the
children
become
accustomed
to
selfishness
and
mental
dependence
besides
this
constant
educational
effort
brings
with
it
the
dulling
of
the
child
personality
if
children
were
free
in
their
own
world
the
nursery
but
out
of
it
had
to
submit
to
the
strict
limits
imposed
by
the
habits
wills
work
and
repose
of
parents
their
requirements
and
their
wishes
they
would
develop
into
a
stronger
and
more
considerate
race
than
the
youth
of
the
present
day
it
is
not
so
much
talking
about
being
considerate
but
the
necessity
of
considering
others
of
really
helping
oneself
and
others
that
has
an
educational
value
in
earlier
days
children
were
quiet
as
mice
in
the
presence
of
elder
persons
instead
of
as
they
do
now
breaking
into
a
guest
conversation
they
learned
to
listen
if
the
conversation
of
adults
is
varied
this
can
be
called
one
of
the
best
educational
methods
for
children
the
ordinary
life
of
children
under
the
old
system
was
lived
in
the
nursery
where
they
received
their
most
important
training
from
an
old
faithful
servant
and
from
one
another
from
their
parents
they
received
corporal
punishment
sometimes
a
caress
in
comparison
with
this
system
the
present
way
of
parents
and
children
living
together
would
be
absolute
progress
if
parents
could
but
abstain
from
explaining
advising
improving
influencing
every
thought
and
every
expression
but
all
spiritual
mental
and
bodily
protective
rules
make
the
child
now
indirectly
selfish
because
everything
centres
about
him
and
therefore
he
is
kept
in
a
constant
state
of
irritation
the
can
disturb
the
conversation
of
the
adult
but
the
is
sent
to
bed
about
eight
even
when
he
with
wide
open
eyes
longs
for
a
conversation
that
might
be
to
him
an
inspiring
stimulus
for
life
certainly
some
simple
habits
so
far
as
conduct
and
order
nourishment
and
sleep
air
and
water
clothing
and
bodily
movement
are
concerned
can
be
made
the
foundations
for
the
child
conceptions
of
morality
he
can
not
be
made
to
learn
soon
enough
that
bodily
health
and
beauty
must
be
regarded
as
high
ethical
characteristics
and
that
what
is
injurious
to
health
and
beauty
must
be
regarded
as
a
hateful
act
in
this
sphere
children
must
be
kept
entirely
independent
of
custom
by
allowing
the
exception
to
every
rule
to
have
its
valid
place
the
present
anxious
solicitude
that
children
should
eat
when
the
clock
strikes
that
they
get
certain
food
at
fixed
meals
that
they
be
clothed
according
to
the
degree
of
temperature
that
they
go
to
bed
when
the
clock
strikes
that
they
be
protected
from
every
drop
of
unboiled
water
and
every
extra
piece
of
candy
this
makes
them
nervous
irritable
slaves
of
habit
a
reasonable
toughening
process
against
the
inequalities
discomforts
and
chances
of
life
constitutes
one
of
the
most
important
bases
of
joy
of
living
and
of
strength
of
temper
in
this
case
too
the
behaviour
of
the
person
who
gives
the
training
is
the
best
means
of
teaching
children
to
smile
at
small
contretemps
things
which
would
throw
a
cloud
over
the
sun
if
one
got
into
the
habit
of
treating
them
as
if
they
were
of
great
importance
if
the
child
sees
the
parent
doing
readily
an
unpleasant
duty
which
he
honestly
recognises
as
unpleasant
if
he
sees
a
parent
endure
trouble
or
an
unexpected
difficulty
easily
he
will
be
in
honour
bound
to
do
the
like
just
as
children
without
many
words
learn
to
practice
good
deeds
when
they
see
good
deeds
practiced
about
them
learn
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
nature
and
art
when
they
see
that
adults
enjoy
them
so
by
living
more
beautifully
more
nobly
more
moderately
we
speak
best
to
children
they
are
just
as
receptive
to
impressions
of
this
kind
as
they
are
careless
of
those
made
by
force
since
this
is
my
alpha
and
omega
in
the
art
of
education
i
repeat
now
what
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
and
half
way
through
it
try
to
leave
the
child
in
peace
interfere
directly
as
seldom
as
possible
keep
away
all
crude
and
impure
impressions
but
give
all
your
care
and
energy
to
see
that
personality
life
itself
reality
in
its
simplicity
and
in
its
nakedness
shall
all
be
means
of
training
the
child
make
demands
on
the
powers
of
children
and
on
their
capacity
for
proportionate
to
the
special
stage
of
their
development
neither
greater
nor
lesser
demands
than
on
adults
but
respect
the
joys
of
the
child
his
tastes
work
and
time
just
as
you
would
those
of
an
adult
education
will
thus
become
an
infinitely
simple
and
infinitely
harder
art
than
the
education
of
the
present
day
with
its
artificialised
existence
its
double
entry
morality
one
morality
for
the
child
and
one
for
the
adult
often
strict
for
the
child
and
lax
for
the
adult
and
vice
versa
by
treating
the
child
every
moment
as
one
does
an
adult
human
being
we
free
education
from
that
brutal
arbitrariness
from
those
protective
rules
which
have
transformed
him
whether
parents
act
as
if
children
existed
for
their
benefit
alone
or
whether
the
parents
give
up
their
whole
lives
to
their
children
the
result
is
alike
deplorable
as
a
rule
both
classes
know
equally
little
of
the
feelings
and
needs
of
their
children
the
one
class
are
happy
when
the
children
are
like
themselves
and
their
highest
ambition
is
to
produce
in
their
children
a
successful
copy
of
their
own
thoughts
opinions
and
ideals
really
it
ought
to
pain
them
very
much
to
see
themselves
so
exactly
copied
what
life
expected
from
them
and
required
from
them
was
just
the
opposite
a
richer
combination
a
better
creation
a
new
type
not
a
reproduction
of
that
which
is
already
exhausted
the
other
class
strive
to
model
their
children
not
according
to
themselves
but
according
to
their
ideal
of
goodness
they
show
their
love
by
their
willingness
to
extinguish
their
own
personalities
for
their
children
sake
this
they
do
by
letting
the
children
feel
that
everything
which
concerns
them
stands
in
the
foreground
this
should
be
so
but
only
indirectly
the
concerns
of
the
whole
scheme
of
life
the
ordering
of
the
home
its
habits
intercourse
purposes
care
for
the
needs
of
children
and
their
sound
development
must
stand
in
the
foreground
but
at
present
in
most
cases
children
of
tender
years
as
well
as
those
who
are
older
are
sacrificed
to
the
chaotic
condition
of
the
home
they
learn
without
possessing
real
freedom
they
live
under
a
discipline
which
is
spasmodic
in
its
application
when
one
daughter
after
another
leaves
home
in
order
to
make
herself
independent
they
are
often
driven
to
do
it
by
want
of
freedom
or
by
the
lack
of
character
in
family
life
in
both
directions
the
girl
sees
herself
forced
to
become
something
different
to
hold
different
opinions
to
think
different
thoughts
to
act
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
her
own
being
a
mother
happy
in
the
friendship
of
her
own
daughter
said
not
long
ago
that
she
desired
to
erect
an
asylum
for
tormented
daughters
such
an
asylum
would
be
as
necessary
as
a
protection
against
pampering
parents
as
against
those
who
are
overbearing
both
alike
torture
their
children
though
in
different
ways
by
not
understanding
the
child
right
to
have
his
own
point
of
view
his
own
ideal
of
happiness
his
own
proper
tastes
and
occupation
they
do
not
see
that
children
exist
as
little
for
their
parent
sake
as
parents
do
for
their
children
sake
family
life
would
have
an
intelligent
character
if
each
one
lived
fully
and
entirely
his
own
life
and
allowed
the
others
to
do
the
same
none
should
tyrannise
over
nor
should
suffer
tyranny
from
the
other
parents
who
give
their
home
this
character
can
justly
demand
that
children
shall
accommodate
themselves
to
the
habits
of
the
household
as
long
as
they
live
in
it
children
on
their
part
can
ask
that
their
own
life
of
thought
and
feeling
shall
be
left
in
peace
at
home
or
that
they
be
treated
with
the
same
consideration
that
would
be
given
to
a
stranger
when
the
parents
do
not
meet
these
conditions
they
themselves
are
the
greater
sufferers
it
is
very
easy
to
keep
one
son
from
expressing
his
raw
views
very
easy
to
tear
a
daughter
away
from
her
book
and
to
bring
her
to
a
by
giving
her
unnecessary
occupations
very
easy
by
a
scornful
word
to
repress
some
powerful
emotion
a
thousand
similar
things
occur
every
day
in
good
families
through
the
whole
world
but
whenever
we
hear
of
young
people
speaking
of
their
intellectual
homelessness
and
sadness
we
begin
to
understand
why
father
and
mother
remain
behind
in
homes
from
which
the
daughters
have
hastened
to
depart
why
children
take
their
cares
joys
and
thoughts
to
strangers
why
in
a
word
the
old
and
the
young
generation
are
as
mutually
dependent
as
the
roots
and
flowers
of
plants
so
often
separate
with
mutual
repulsion
this
is
as
true
of
highly
cultivated
fathers
and
mothers
as
of
simple
bourgeois
or
peasant
parents
perhaps
indeed
it
may
be
truer
of
the
first
class
the
latter
torment
their
children
in
a
naive
way
while
the
former
are
infinitely
wise
and
methodical
in
their
stupidity
rarely
is
a
mother
of
the
upper
class
one
of
those
artists
of
home
life
who
through
the
blitheness
the
goodness
and
joyousness
of
her
character
makes
the
rhythm
of
everyday
life
a
dance
and
holidays
into
festivals
such
artists
are
often
simple
women
who
have
passed
no
examinations
founded
no
clubs
and
written
no
books
the
highly
cultivated
mothers
and
the
socially
useful
mothers
on
the
other
hand
are
not
seldom
those
who
call
forth
criticism
from
their
sons
it
seems
almost
an
invariable
rule
that
mothers
should
make
mistakes
when
they
wish
to
act
for
the
welfare
of
their
sons
how
infinitely
valuable
say
their
children
would
i
have
found
a
mother
who
could
have
kept
quiet
who
would
have
been
patient
with
me
who
would
have
given
me
rest
keeping
the
outer
world
at
a
distance
from
me
with
kindly
soothing
hands
oh
would
that
i
had
had
a
mother
on
whose
breast
i
could
have
laid
my
head
to
be
quiet
and
dream
a
distinguished
woman
writer
is
surprised
that
all
of
her
plans
for
her
children
fail
those
children
in
whom
she
saw
the
material
for
her
passion
for
governing
the
clay
that
she
desired
to
mould
the
writer
just
cited
says
very
justly
that
maternal
unselfishness
alone
can
perform
the
task
of
protecting
a
young
being
with
wisdom
and
kindliness
by
allowing
him
to
grow
according
to
his
own
laws
the
unselfish
mother
she
says
will
joyfully
give
the
best
of
her
life
energy
powers
of
soul
and
spirit
to
a
growing
being
and
then
open
all
doors
to
him
leaving
him
in
the
broad
world
to
follow
his
own
paths
and
ask
for
nothing
neither
thanks
nor
praise
nor
remembrance
but
to
most
mothers
may
be
applied
the
bitter
exclamation
of
a
son
in
the
book
just
mentioned
even
a
mother
must
know
how
she
tortures
another
if
she
has
not
this
capacity
by
nature
why
in
the
world
should
i
recognise
her
as
my
mother
at
all
certain
mothers
spend
the
whole
day
in
keeping
their
children
nervous
system
in
a
state
of
irritation
they
make
work
hard
and
play
joyless
whenever
they
take
a
part
in
it
at
the
present
time
too
the
school
gets
control
of
the
child
the
home
loses
all
the
means
by
which
formerly
it
moulded
the
child
soul
life
and
ennobled
family
life
the
school
not
father
and
mother
teaches
children
to
play
the
school
gives
them
manual
training
the
school
teaches
them
to
sing
to
look
at
pictures
to
read
aloud
to
wander
about
out
of
doors
schools
clubs
sport
and
other
pleasures
accustom
youth
in
the
cities
more
and
more
to
outside
life
and
a
daily
recreation
that
kills
the
true
feeling
for
holiday
young
people
often
have
no
other
impression
of
home
than
that
it
is
a
place
where
they
meet
society
which
bores
them
parents
surrender
their
children
to
schools
in
those
years
in
which
they
should
influence
their
minds
when
the
school
gives
them
back
they
do
not
know
how
to
make
a
fresh
start
with
the
children
for
they
themselves
have
ceased
to
be
young
but
getting
old
is
no
necessity
it
is
only
a
bad
habit
it
is
very
interesting
to
observe
a
face
that
is
getting
old
what
time
makes
out
of
a
face
shows
better
than
anything
else
what
the
man
has
made
out
of
time
most
men
in
the
early
period
of
middle
age
are
neither
intellectually
fat
nor
lean
they
are
hardened
or
dried
up
naturally
young
people
look
upon
them
with
unsympathetic
eyes
for
they
feel
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
eternal
youth
which
a
soul
can
win
as
a
prize
for
its
whole
work
of
inner
development
but
they
look
in
vain
for
this
second
eternal
youth
in
their
elders
filled
with
worldly
nothingnesses
and
things
of
temporary
importance
with
a
sigh
they
exclude
the
old
people
from
their
future
plans
and
they
go
out
in
the
world
in
order
to
choose
their
spiritual
parents
this
is
tragic
but
just
for
if
there
is
a
field
on
which
man
must
sow
a
in
order
to
harvest
tenfold
it
is
the
souls
of
children
when
i
began
at
five
years
of
age
to
make
a
rag
doll
that
by
its
weight
and
size
really
gave
the
illusion
of
reality
and
bestowed
much
joy
on
its
young
mother
i
began
to
think
about
the
education
of
my
future
children
then
as
now
my
educational
ideal
was
that
the
children
should
be
happy
that
they
should
not
fear
fear
is
the
misfortune
of
childhood
and
the
sufferings
of
the
child
come
from
the
opposition
between
his
unlimited
possibilities
of
happiness
and
the
way
in
which
these
possibilities
are
actually
handled
it
may
be
said
that
life
at
every
stage
is
cruel
in
its
treatment
of
our
possibilities
of
happiness
but
the
difference
between
the
sufferings
of
the
adult
from
existence
and
the
sufferings
of
the
child
caused
by
adults
is
tremendous
the
child
is
unwilling
to
resign
himself
to
the
sufferings
imposed
upon
him
by
adults
and
the
more
impatient
the
child
is
against
unnecessary
suffering
the
better
for
so
much
the
more
certainly
will
he
some
day
be
driven
to
find
means
to
transform
for
himself
and
for
others
the
hard
necessities
of
life
a
poet
rydberg
in
our
country
who
had
the
deepest
intuition
into
child
nature
and
therefore
had
the
deepest
reverence
for
it
wrote
as
follows
where
we
behold
children
we
suspect
there
are
princes
but
as
to
the
kings
where
are
they
not
only
life
tragic
elements
diminish
and
dam
up
its
vital
energies
equally
destructive
is
a
parent
want
of
reverence
for
the
sources
of
life
which
meet
them
in
a
new
being
fathers
and
mothers
must
bow
their
heads
in
the
dust
before
the
exalted
nature
of
the
child
until
they
see
that
the
word
child
is
only
another
expression
for
the
conception
of
majesty
until
they
feel
that
it
is
the
future
which
in
the
form
of
a
child
sleeps
in
their
arms
and
history
which
plays
at
their
feet
they
will
not
understand
that
they
have
as
little
power
or
right
to
prescribe
laws
for
this
new
being
as
they
possess
the
power
or
might
to
lay
down
paths
for
the
stars
the
mother
should
feel
the
same
reverence
for
the
unknown
worlds
in
the
eyes
of
her
child
that
she
has
for
the
worlds
which
like
white
blossoms
are
sprinkled
over
the
blue
orb
of
heaven
the
father
should
see
in
his
child
the
king
son
whom
he
must
serve
humbly
with
his
own
best
powers
and
then
the
child
will
come
to
his
own
not
to
the
right
of
asking
others
to
become
the
plaything
of
his
caprices
but
to
the
right
of
living
his
full
strong
personal
child
life
along
with
a
father
and
a
mother
who
themselves
live
a
personal
life
a
life
from
whose
sources
and
powers
the
child
can
take
the
elements
he
needs
for
his
own
individual
growth
parents
should
never
expect
their
own
highest
ideals
to
become
the
ideals
of
their
child
the
sons
of
pious
parents
and
the
christian
children
of
freethinkers
have
become
almost
proverbial
but
parents
can
live
nobly
and
in
entire
accordance
to
their
own
ideals
which
is
the
same
thing
as
making
children
idealists
this
can
often
lead
to
a
quite
different
system
of
thought
from
that
pursued
by
the
parent
as
to
ideals
the
elders
should
here
as
elsewhere
offer
with
timidity
their
advice
and
their
experience
yes
they
should
try
to
let
the
young
people
search
for
it
as
if
they
were
seeking
fruit
hidden
under
the
shadow
of
leaves
if
their
counsel
is
rejected
they
must
show
neither
surprise
nor
lack
of
the
query
of
a
humourist
why
he
should
do
anything
for
posterity
since
posterity
had
done
nothing
for
him
set
me
to
thinking
in
my
early
youth
in
the
most
serious
way
i
felt
that
posterity
had
done
much
for
its
forefathers
it
had
given
them
an
infinite
horizon
for
the
future
beyond
the
bounds
of
their
daily
effort
we
must
in
the
child
see
the
new
fate
of
the
human
race
we
must
carefully
treat
the
fine
threads
in
the
child
soul
because
these
are
the
threads
that
one
day
will
form
the
woof
of
world
events
we
must
realise
that
every
pebble
by
which
one
breaks
into
the
glassy
depths
of
the
child
soul
will
extend
its
influence
through
centuries
and
centuries
in
ever
widening
circles
through
our
fathers
without
our
will
and
without
choice
we
are
given
a
destiny
which
controls
the
deepest
foundation
of
our
own
being
through
our
posterity
which
we
ourselves
create
we
can
in
a
certain
measure
as
free
beings
determine
the
future
destiny
of
the
human
race
by
a
realisation
of
all
this
in
an
entirely
new
way
by
seeing
the
whole
process
in
the
light
of
the
religion
of
development
the
twentieth
century
will
be
the
century
of
the
child
this
will
come
about
in
two
ways
adults
will
first
come
to
an
understanding
of
the
character
and
then
the
simplicity
of
the
child
character
will
be
kept
by
adults
so
the
old
social
order
will
be
able
to
renew
itself
psychological
pedagogy
has
an
exalted
ancestry
i
will
not
go
back
to
those
artists
in
education
called
socrates
and
jesus
but
i
commence
with
the
modern
world
in
the
hours
of
its
sunrise
in
which
we
who
look
back
think
we
see
a
futile
renaissance
then
as
now
the
spring
flowers
came
up
amid
the
decaying
foliage
at
this
period
there
came
a
demand
for
the
remodelling
of
education
through
the
great
figure
of
modern
times
montaigne
that
skeptic
who
had
so
deep
a
reverence
for
realities
in
his
essays
in
his
letters
to
the
countess
of
gurson
are
found
all
of
the
elements
for
the
education
of
the
future
about
the
great
german
and
swiss
specialists
in
pedagogy
and
psychology
comenius
basedow
pestalozzi
salzmann
froebel
herbart
i
do
not
need
to
speak
i
will
only
mention
that
the
greatest
men
of
germany
lessing
herder
goethe
kant
and
others
took
the
side
of
natural
training
in
regard
to
england
it
is
well
known
that
john
locke
in
his
thoughts
on
education
was
a
worthy
predecessor
of
herbert
spencer
whose
book
on
education
in
its
intellectual
moral
and
physical
relations
was
the
most
noteworthy
book
on
education
in
the
last
century
it
has
been
noted
that
spencer
in
educational
theory
is
indebted
to
rousseau
and
that
in
many
cases
he
has
only
said
what
the
great
german
authorities
whom
he
certainly
did
not
know
said
before
him
but
this
does
not
diminish
spencer
merit
in
the
least
absolutely
new
thoughts
are
very
rare
truths
which
were
once
new
must
be
constantly
renewed
by
being
pronounced
again
from
the
depth
of
the
ardent
personal
conviction
of
a
new
human
being
that
rational
thoughts
on
the
subject
of
pedagogy
as
on
other
subjects
are
constantly
expressed
and
shows
among
other
things
that
reasonable
or
practically
untried
education
has
certain
principles
which
are
as
axiomatic
as
those
of
mathematics
every
reasonable
thinking
man
must
as
certainly
discover
anew
these
pedagogical
principles
as
he
must
discover
anew
the
relation
between
the
angles
of
a
triangle
spencer
book
it
is
true
has
not
laid
again
the
foundation
of
education
it
can
rather
be
called
the
crown
of
the
edifice
founded
by
montaigne
locke
rousseau
and
the
great
german
specialists
in
pedagogy
what
is
an
absolutely
novel
factor
in
our
times
is
the
study
of
the
psychology
of
the
child
and
the
system
of
education
that
has
developed
from
it
in
england
through
the
scientist
darwin
this
new
study
of
the
psychology
of
the
child
was
inaugurated
in
germany
preyer
contributed
to
its
extension
he
has
done
so
partly
by
a
comprehensive
study
of
children
language
partly
by
collecting
recollections
of
childhood
on
the
part
of
the
adult
finally
he
experimented
directly
on
the
child
investigating
his
physical
and
psychical
fatigue
and
endurance
acuteness
of
sensation
power
speed
and
exactness
in
carrying
out
physical
and
mental
tasks
he
has
studied
his
capacity
of
attention
in
emotions
and
in
ideas
at
different
periods
of
life
he
has
studied
the
speech
of
children
association
of
ideas
in
children
etc
during
the
study
of
the
psychology
of
the
child
scholars
began
to
substitute
for
this
term
the
expression
genetic
psychology
for
it
was
found
that
the
principle
was
valid
for
the
development
both
of
the
psychic
and
the
physical
life
this
principle
means
that
the
history
of
the
species
is
repeated
in
the
history
of
the
individual
a
truth
substantiated
in
other
spheres
in
philology
for
example
the
psychology
of
the
child
is
of
the
same
significance
for
general
psychology
as
embryology
is
for
anatomy
on
the
other
hand
the
description
of
savage
peoples
of
peoples
in
a
natural
condition
such
as
we
find
in
descriptive
sociology
or
weitz
anthropology
is
extremely
instructive
for
a
right
conception
of
the
psychology
of
the
child
it
is
in
this
kind
of
psychological
investigation
that
the
greatest
progress
has
been
made
in
this
century
in
the
great
publication
zeitschrift
fur
psychologie
there
began
in
a
special
department
for
the
psychology
of
children
and
the
psychology
of
education
in
there
were
as
many
as
one
hundred
and
six
essays
devoted
to
this
subject
and
they
are
constantly
increasing
in
the
chief
civilised
countries
this
investigation
has
many
distinguished
pioneers
such
as
wundt
ribot
and
others
in
germany
this
subject
has
its
most
important
organ
in
the
journal
mentioned
above
it
numbers
among
its
collaborators
some
of
the
most
distinguished
german
physiologists
and
psychologists
as
related
to
the
same
subject
must
be
mentioned
wundt
philosophischen
studien
and
partly
the
vierteljahrschrift
fur
wissenschaftlichie
philosophie
in
france
there
was
founded
in
the
annee
psychologique
edited
by
binet
and
beaunis
and
also
the
bibliotheque
de
pedagogie
et
de
psychologie
edited
by
binet
in
england
there
are
the
journals
mind
and
brain
special
laboratories
for
experimental
psychology
with
psychological
apparatus
and
methods
of
research
are
found
in
many
places
in
germany
the
first
to
be
founded
was
that
of
wundt
in
the
year
at
leipzig
france
has
a
laboratory
for
experimental
psychology
at
paris
in
the
sorbonne
whose
director
is
binet
italy
one
in
rome
in
america
experimental
psychology
is
zealously
pursued
as
early
as
there
were
in
that
country
laboratories
for
experimental
psychology
and
four
journals
there
should
also
be
mentioned
the
societies
for
child
psychology
recently
one
has
been
founded
in
germany
others
before
this
time
have
been
at
work
in
england
and
america
a
whole
series
of
investigations
carried
out
in
kraepelin
laboratory
in
heidelberg
are
of
the
greatest
value
for
determining
what
the
brain
can
do
in
the
way
of
work
and
impressions
an
english
specialist
has
maintained
that
the
future
thanks
to
the
modern
school
system
will
be
able
to
get
along
without
originally
creative
men
because
the
receptive
activities
of
modern
man
will
absorb
the
cooperative
powers
of
the
brain
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
productive
powers
and
even
if
this
were
not
a
universally
valid
statement
but
only
expressed
a
physiological
certainty
people
will
some
day
perhaps
cease
filing
down
man
brain
by
that
sandpapering
process
called
a
school
curriculum
a
champion
of
the
transformation
of
pedagogy
into
a
science
is
to
be
found
in
sweden
in
the
person
of
hjalmar
oehrwal
who
has
discussed
in
his
essays
native
and
foreign
discoveries
in
the
field
of
psychology
one
of
his
conclusions
is
that
the
technical
exercises
gymnastics
manual
training
sloyd
and
the
like
are
not
as
they
are
erroneously
called
a
relaxation
from
mental
overstrain
by
change
in
work
but
simply
a
new
form
of
brain
fatigue
all
work
he
finds
done
under
conditions
of
fatigue
is
uneconomic
whether
one
regards
the
quantity
produced
or
its
value
as
an
exercise
rest
should
be
nothing
more
than
rest
freedom
to
do
only
what
one
wants
to
or
to
do
nothing
at
all
as
to
fear
he
proves
following
binet
investigation
in
this
subject
how
corporal
discipline
threats
and
ridicule
lead
to
cowardice
how
all
of
these
methods
are
to
be
rejected
because
they
are
depressing
and
tend
to
a
diminution
of
energy
he
shows
moreover
how
fear
can
be
overcome
progressively
by
strengthening
the
nervous
system
and
in
that
way
strengthening
the
character
this
result
comes
about
partly
when
all
unnecessary
terrorising
is
avoided
partly
when
children
are
accustomed
to
bear
calmly
and
quietly
the
inevitable
unpleasantnesses
of
danger
axel
key
investigations
on
school
children
have
won
international
recognition
in
sweden
they
have
supplied
the
most
significant
material
up
to
the
present
time
for
determining
the
influence
of
studies
on
physical
development
and
the
results
of
intellectual
overstrain
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
when
through
empirical
investigation
we
begin
to
get
acquainted
with
the
real
nature
of
children
the
school
and
the
home
will
be
freed
from
absurd
notions
about
the
character
and
needs
of
the

absurd
notions

now

is
the

of
