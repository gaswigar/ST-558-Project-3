the

constantly
recurring
in
this
poem
the
last
pages
of

have
been

under
the
hospitality
of
your

my

cousin
and

therefore
and
preparing
once

i
venture
to
leave
in
your
hands
this
book
the
most
mature
of
my
works
and
the
one
into
which
my
highest
convictions
upon
life
and
art
have
entered
that
as
through
my
various
efforts
in
literature
and
steps
in
life
you
have
believed
in
me
borne
with
me
and
been
generous
to
me
far
beyond
the
common
uses
of
mere
relationship
or
sympathy
of
mind
so
you
may
kindly
accept
in

of
the

this
poor

your

keeps
it
in

and
looks
at
it
long
after

has

together

he

thus
am
still
what
men
call
young

have
not
so
far
left
the
coasts
of

to

inland
that
i
can
not
hear
that
murmur
of
the
outer
infinite
which
unweaned
babies
smile
at
in
their
sleep
when
wondered
at
for
smiling
not
so
far

noise
while
her
sweet
eyes
leap
forward
taking

i
sit
and
feel

father

slow
hand
when
she
had
left
us

out
my
childish
curls
across
his
knee
and
hear

daily
jest

liked
it

my
mother
was
a
florentine
whose
rare
blue
eyes
were
shut
from
seeing
me
when
scarcely
i
was
four
years
old
my
life
a
poor
spark
snatched
up
from
a
failing
lamp
which
went
out
therefore
she
was
weak
and
frail
she
could
not
bear
the
joy
of
giving
the
mother
s
rapture
slew
her
if
her
kiss
had
left
a
longer
weight
upon
my
lips
it
might
have
steadied
the
uneasy
breath
and
reconciled
and
fraternised
my
soul
with
the
new
order
as
it
was
indeed
i
felt
a
about
the
world
and
still
went
seeking
like
a
bleating
lamb
left
out
at
night
in
shutting
up
the
fold
as
restless
as
a
bird
grown
chill
through
something
being
away
though
what
it
knows
not
i
aurora
leigh
was
born
to
make
my
father
sadder
and
myself
not
overjoyous
truly
women
know
the
way
to
rear
up
children
to
be
just
they
know
a
simple
merry
tender
knack
of
tying
sashes
fitting
and
stringing
pretty
words
that
make
no
sense
and
kissing
full
sense
into
empty
words
which
things
are
corals
to
cut
life
upon
although
such
trifles
children
learn
by
such
love
s
holy
earnest
in
a
pretty
play
and
get
not
solemnised
but
seeing
as
in
a
love
s
divine
which
burns
and
hurts
not
a
single
bloom
become
aware
and
unafraid
of
love
such
good
do
mothers
fathers
love
as
well
did
i
know
still
with
heavier
brains
and
wills
more
consciously
responsible
and
not
as
wisely
since
less
foolishly
so
mothers
have
god
s
licence
to
be
missed
my
father
was
an
austere
englishman
who
after
a
dry
spent
at
home
in
law
and
parish
talk
was
flooded
with
a
passion
unaware
his
whole
provisioned
and
complacent
past
drowned
out
from
him
that
moment
as
he
stood
in
florence
where
he
had
come
to
spend
a
month
and
note
the
secret
of
da
vinci
s
drains
he
musing
somewhat
absently
perhaps
some
english
question
whether
men
should
pay
the
unpopular
but
necessary
tax
with
left
or
right
the
alien
sun
in
that
great
square
of
the
santissima
there
drifted
past
him
scarcely
marked
enough
to
move
his
comfortable
a
train
of
priestly
banners
cross
and
psalm
the
maidens
holding
up
tall
tapers
weighty
for
such
wrists
aslant
to
the
blue
luminous
tremor
of
the
air
and
letting
drop
the
white
wax
as
they
went
to
eat
the
bishop
s
wafer
at
the
church
from
which
long
trail
of
chanting
priests
and
girls
a
face
flashed
like
a
cymbal
on
his
face
and
shook
with
silent
clangour
brain
and
heart
transfiguring
him
to
music
thus
even
thus
he
too
received
his
sacramental
gift
with
eucharistic
meanings
for
he
loved
and
thus
beloved
she
died
i
ve
heard
it
said
that
but
to
see
him
in
the
first
surprise
of
widower
and
father
nursing
me
unmothered
little
child
of
four
years
old
his
large
man
s
hands
afraid
to
touch
my
curls
as
if
the
gold
would
tarnish
grave
lips
contriving
such
a
miserable
smile
as
if
he
knew
needs
must
or
i
should
die
and
yet
twas
hard
almost
make
the
stones
cry
out
for
pity
there
s
a
verse
he
set
in
santa
croce
to
her
memory
weep
for
an
infant
too
young
to
weep
much
when
death
removed
this
mother
the
mirth
on
women
s
faces
when
they
walk
with
rosy
children
hanging
on
their
gowns
under
the
cloister
to
escape
the
sun
that
scorches
in
the
piazza
after
which
he
left
our
florence
and
made
haste
to
hide
himself
his
prattling
child
and
silent
grief
among
the
mountains
above
pelago
because
unmothered
babes
he
thought
had
need
of
mother
nature
more
than
others
use
and
pan
s
white
goats
with
udders
warm
and
full
of
mystic
contemplations
come
to
feed
poor
milkless
lips
of
orphans
like
his
such
he
talked
i
ve
heard
from
friends
for
even
prosaic
men
who
wear
grief
long
will
get
to
wear
it
as
a
hat
aside
with
a
flower
stuck
in
t
father
then
and
child
we
lived
among
the
mountains
many
years
god
s
silence
on
the
outside
of
the
house
and
we
who
did
not
speak
too
loud
within
and
old
assunta
to
make
up
the
fire
crossing
herself
whene
er
a
sudden
flame
which
lightened
from
the
firewood
made
alive
that
picture
of
my
mother
on
the
wall
the
painter
drew
it
after
she
was
dead
and
when
the
face
was
finished
throat
and
hands
her
cameriera
carried
him
in
hate
of
the
shroud
the
last
brocade
she
dressed
in
at
the
pitti
he
should
paint
no
sadder
thing
than
that
she
swore
to
wrong
her
poor
therefore
very
strange
the
effect
was
i
a
little
child
would
crouch
for
hours
upon
the
floor
with
knees
drawn
up
and
gaze
across
them
half
in
terror
half
in
adoration
at
the
picture
there
that
supernatural
white
life
just
sailing
upward
from
the
red
stiff
silk
which
seemed
to
have
no
part
in
it
nor
power
to
keep
it
from
quite
breaking
out
of
bounds
for
hours
i
sate
and
stared
assunta
s
awe
and
my
poor
father
s
melancholy
eyes
still
pointed
that
way
that
way
went
my
thoughts
when
wandering
beyond
sight
and
as
i
grew
in
years
i
mixed
confused
unconsciously
whatever
i
last
read
or
heard
or
dreamed
abhorrent
admirable
beautiful
pathetical
or
ghastly
or
grotesque
with
still
that
face
which
did
not
therefore
change
but
kept
the
mystic
level
of
all
forms
and
fears
and
admirations
was
by
turns
ghost
fiend
and
angel
fairy
witch
and
sprite
a
dauntless
muse
who
eyes
a
dreadful
fate
a
loving
psyche
who
loses
sight
of
love
a
still
medusa
with
mild
milky
brows
all
curdled
and
all
clothed
upon
with
snakes
whose
slime
falls
fast
as
sweat
will
or
anon
our
lady
of
the
passion
stabbed
with
swords
where
the
babe
sucked
or
lamia
in
her
first
moonlighted
pallor
ere
she
shrunk
and
blinked
and
shuddering
wriggled
down
to
the
unclean
or
my
own
mother
leaving
her
last
smile
in
her
last
kiss
upon
the
my
father
pushed
down
on
the
bed
for
that
or
my
dead
mother
without
smile
or
kiss
buried
at
florence
all
which
images
concentred
on
the
picture
glassed
themselves
before
my
meditative
childhood
as
the
incoherencies
of
change
and
death
are
represented
fully
mixed
and
merged
in
the
smooth
fair
mystery
of
perpetual
life
and
while
i
stared
away
my
childish
wits
upon
my
mother
s
picture
ah
poor
child
my
father
who
through
love
had
suddenly
thrown
off
the
old
conventions
broken
loose
from
of
the
soul
like
lazarus
yet
had
no
time
to
learn
to
talk
and
walk
or
grow
anew
familiar
with
the
sun
who
had
reached
to
freedom
not
to
action
lived
but
lived
as
one
entranced
with
thoughts
not
aims
whom
love
had
unmade
from
a
common
man
but
not
completed
to
an
uncommon
man
my
father
taught
me
what
he
had
learnt
the
best
before
he
died
and
left
me
and
love
and
seeing
we
had
books
among
the
hills
strong
words
of
counselling
souls
confederate
with
vocal
pines
and
waters
of
books
he
taught
me
all
the
ignorance
of
men
and
how
god
laughs
in
heaven
when
any
man
says
here
i
m
learned
this
i
understand
in
that
i
am
never
caught
at
fault
or
he
sent
the
schools
to
school
demonstrating
a
fool
will
pass
for
such
through
one
mistake
while
a
philosopher
will
pass
for
such
through
said
mistakes
being
ventured
in
the
gross
and
heaped
up
to
a
system
i
am
like
they
tell
me
my
dear
father
broader
brows
howbeit
upon
a
slenderer
undergrowth
of
delicate
features
near
as
grave
but
then
my
mother
s
smile
breaks
up
the
whole
and
makes
it
better
sometimes
than
itself
so
nine
full
years
our
days
were
hid
with
god
among
his
mountains
i
was
just
thirteen
still
growing
like
the
plants
from
unseen
roots
in
springs
suddenly
awoke
to
full
life
and
its
needs
and
agonies
with
an
intense
strong
struggling
heart
beside
a
father
life
struck
sharp
on
death
makes
awful
lightning
his
last
word
was
love
my
child
love
love
then
he
had
done
with
grief
love
my
ere
i
answered
he
was
gone
and
none
was
left
to
love
in
all
the
world
there
ended
childhood
what
succeeded
next
i
recollect
as
after
fevers
men
thread
back
the
passage
of
delirium
missing
the
turn
still
baffled
by
the
door
smooth
endless
days
notched
here
and
there
with
knives
a
weary
wormy
darkness
spurred
i
the
flank
with
flame
that
it
should
eat
and
end
itself
like
some
tormented
scorpion
then
at
last
i
do
remember
clearly
how
there
came
a
stranger
with
authority
not
right
i
thought
not
who
commanded
caught
me
up
from
old
assunta
s
neck
how
with
a
shriek
she
let
me
go
i
with
ears
too
full
of
my
father
s
silence
to
shriek
back
a
word
in
all
a
child
s
astonishment
at
grief
stared
at
the
wharfage
where
she
stood
and
moaned
my
poor
assunta
where
she
stood
and
moaned
the
white
walls
the
blue
hills
my
italy
drawn
backward
from
the
shuddering
like
one
in
anger
drawing
back
her
skirts
which
suppliants
catch
at
then
the
bitter
sea
inexorably
pushed
between
us
both
and
sweeping
up
the
ship
with
my
despair
threw
us
out
as
a
pasture
to
the
stars
ten
nights
and
days
we
voyaged
on
the
deep
ten
nights
and
days
without
the
common
face
of
any
day
or
night
the
moon
and
sun
cut
off
from
the
green
reconciling
earth
to
starve
into
a
blind
ferocity
and
glare
unnatural
the
very
sky
dropping
its
down
upon
the
sea
as
if
no
human
heart
should
scape
alive
bedraggled
with
the
desolating
salt
until
it
seemed
no
more
that
holy
heaven
to
which
my
father
went
all
new
and
the
universe
turned
stranger
for
a
child
then
land
england
oh
the
frosty
cliffs
looked
cold
upon
me
could
i
find
a
home
among
those
mean
red
houses
through
the
fog
and
when
i
heard
my
father
s
language
first
from
alien
lips
which
had
no
kiss
for
mine
i
wept
aloud
then
laughed
then
wept
then
wept
and
some
one
near
me
said
the
child
was
mad
through
much
the
train
swept
us
on
was
this
my
father
s
england
the
great
isle
the
ground
seemed
cut
up
from
the
fellowship
of
verdure
field
from
field
as
man
from
man
the
skies
themselves
looked
low
and
positive
as
almost
you
could
touch
them
with
a
hand
and
dared
to
do
it
they
were
so
far
off
from
god
s
celestial
crystals
all
things
blurred
and
dull
and
vague
did
shakspeare
and
his
mates
absorb
the
light
here
a
hill
or
stone
with
heart
to
strike
a
radiant
colour
up
or
active
outline
on
the
indifferent
air
i
think
i
see
my
father
s
sister
stand
upon
the
of
her
to
give
me
welcome
she
stood
straight
and
calm
her
somewhat
narrow
forehead
braided
tight
as
if
for
taming
accidental
thoughts
from
possible
pulses
brown
hair
pricked
with
grey
by
frigid
use
of
life
she
was
not
old
although
my
father
s
elder
by
a
year
a
nose
drawn
sharply
yet
in
delicate
lines
a
close
mild
mouth
a
little
soured
about
the
ends
through
speaking
unrequited
loves
or
peradventure
niggardly
eyes
of
no
colour
they
might
have
smiled
but
never
never
have
forgot
themselves
in
smiling
cheeks
in
which
was
yet
a
rose
of
perished
summers
like
a
rose
in
a
book
kept
more
for
ruth
than
pleasure
past
bloom
past
fading
also
she
had
lived
we
ll
say
a
harmless
life
she
called
a
virtuous
life
a
quiet
life
which
was
not
life
at
all
but
that
she
had
not
lived
enough
to
know
between
the
vicar
and
the
county
squires
the
looking
down
sometimes
from
the
empyreal
to
assure
their
souls
against
and
in
the
abyss
the
apothecary
looked
on
once
a
year
to
prove
their
soundness
of
humility
the
exercised
her
christian
gifts
of
knitting
stockings
stitching
petticoats
because
we
are
of
one
flesh
after
all
and
need
one
flannel
with
a
proper
sense
of
difference
in
the
quality
still
the
guarded
from
your
modern
trick
of
shaking
dangerous
questions
from
the
crease
preserved
her
intellectual
she
had
lived
a
sort
of
life
born
in
a
cage
accounting
that
to
leap
from
perch
to
perch
was
act
and
joy
enough
for
any
bird
dear
heaven
how
silly
are
the
things
that
live
in
thickets
and
eat
berries
i
alas
a
wild
bird
scarcely
fledged
was
brought
to
her
cage
and
she
was
there
to
meet
me
very
kind
bring
the
clean
water
give
out
the
fresh
seed
she
stood
upon
the
steps
to
welcome
me
calm
in
black
garb
i
clung
about
her
neck
young
babes
who
catch
at
every
shred
of
wool
to
draw
the
new
light
closer
catch
and
cling
less
blindly
in
my
ears
my
father
s
word
hummed
ignorantly
as
the
sea
in
shells
love
love
my
she
black
there
with
my
grief
might
feel
my
was
his
sister
i
clung
to
her
a
moment
she
seemed
moved
kissed
me
with
cold
lips
suffered
me
to
cling
and
drew
me
feebly
through
the
hall
into
the
room
she
sate
in
there
with
some
strange
spasm
of
pain
and
passion
she
wrung
loose
my
hands
imperiously
and
held
me
at
arm
s
length
and
with
two
eyes
searched
through
my
face
stabbed
it
through
and
through
through
brows
and
cheeks
and
chin
as
if
to
find
a
wicked
murderer
in
my
innocent
face
if
not
here
there
perhaps
then
drawing
breath
she
struggled
for
her
ordinary
calm
and
missed
it
rather
me
not
to
shrink
as
if
she
had
told
me
not
to
lie
or
swear
she
loved
my
father
and
would
love
me
too
as
long
as
i
deserved
very
kind
i
understood
her
meaning
afterward
she
thought
to
find
my
mother
in
my
face
and
questioned
it
for
that
for
she
my
aunt
had
loved
my
father
truly
as
she
could
and
hated
with
the
gall
of
gentle
souls
my
tuscan
mother
who
had
fooled
away
a
wise
man
from
wise
courses
a
good
man
from
obvious
duties
and
depriving
her
his
sister
of
the
household
precedence
had
wronged
his
tenants
robbed
his
native
land
and
made
him
mad
alike
by
life
and
death
in
love
and
sorrow
she
had
pored
for
years
what
sort
of
woman
could
be
suitable
to
her
sort
of
hate
to
entertain
it
with
and
so
her
very
curiosity
became
hate
too
and
all
the
idealism
she
ever
used
in
life
was
used
for
hate
till
hate
so
nourished
did
exceed
at
last
the
love
from
which
it
grew
in
strength
and
heat
and
wrinkled
her
smooth
conscience
with
a
sense
of
disputable
virtue
say
not
sin
when
christian
doctrine
was
enforced
at
church
and
thus
my
father
s
sister
was
to
me
my
mother
s
hater
from
that
day
she
did
her
duty
to
me
i
appreciate
it
in
her
own
word
as
spoken
to
herself
her
duty
in
large
measure
out
but
measured
always
she
was
generous
bland
more
courteous
than
was
tender
gave
me
still
the
first
place
if
fearful
that
god
s
saints
would
look
down
suddenly
and
say
herein
you
missed
a
point
i
think
through
lack
of
alas
a
mother
never
is
afraid
of
speaking
angerly
to
any
child
since
love
she
knows
is
justified
of
love
and
i
i
was
a
good
child
on
the
whole
a
meek
and
manageable
child
why
not
i
did
not
live
to
have
the
faults
of
life
there
seemed
more
true
life
in
my
father
s
grave
than
in
all
england
since
threw
me
off
who
fain
would
cleave
his
latest
will
they
say
consigned
me
to
his
land
i
only
thought
of
lying
quiet
there
where
i
was
thrown
like
on
the
rocks
and
suffer
her
to
prick
me
to
a
pattern
with
her
pin
fibre
from
fibre
delicate
leaf
from
leaf
and
dry
out
from
my
drowned
anatomy
the
last
left
in
me
so
it
was
i
broke
the
copious
curls
upon
my
head
in
braids
because
she
liked
hair
i
left
off
saying
my
sweet
tuscan
words
which
still
at
any
stirring
of
the
heart
came
up
to
float
across
the
english
phrase
as
lilies
or
ch
because
she
liked
my
father
s
child
to
speak
his
tongue
i
learnt
the
collects
and
the
catechism
the
creeds
from
athanasius
back
to
nice
the
articles
the
tracts
the
times
by
no
means
buonaventure
s
prick
of
love
and
various
popular
synopses
of
inhuman
doctrines
never
taught
by
john
because
she
liked
instructed
piety
i
learnt
my
complement
of
classic
french
kept
pure
of
balzac
and
neologism
and
german
also
since
she
liked
a
range
of
liberal
education
not
books
i
learnt
a
little
algebra
a
little
of
the
mathematics
with
extreme
flounce
the
circle
of
the
sciences
because
she
misliked
women
who
are
frivolous
i
learnt
the
royal
genealogies
of
oviedo
the
internal
laws
of
the
burmese
empire
by
how
many
feet
mount
chimborazo
outsoars
himmeleh
what
navigable
river
joins
itself
to
lara
and
what
census
of
the
year
five
was
taken
at
klagenfurt
she
liked
a
general
insight
into
useful
facts
i
learnt
much
music
as
would
have
been
as
quite
impossible
in
johnson
s
day
as
still
it
might
be
sleights
of
hand
and
unimagined
fingering
shuffling
off
the
hearer
s
soul
through
hurricanes
of
notes
to
a
noisy
tophet
and
i
drew
costumes
from
french
engravings
nereids
neatly
draped
with
smirks
of
simmering
godship
washed
in
from
nature
landscapes
rather
say
washed
out
i
danced
the
polka
and
cellarius
spun
glass
stuffed
birds
and
modelled
flowers
in
wax
because
she
liked
accomplishments
in
girls
i
read
a
score
of
books
on
womanhood
to
prove
if
women
do
not
think
at
all
they
may
teach
thinking
to
a
or
else
the
author
demonstrating
their
right
of
comprehending
husband
s
talk
when
not
too
deep
and
even
of
answering
with
pretty
may
it
please
you
or
so
it
is
their
rapid
insight
and
fine
aptitude
particular
worth
and
general
missionariness
as
long
as
they
keep
quiet
by
the
fire
and
never
say
no
when
the
world
says
ay
for
that
is
fatal
angelic
reach
of
virtue
chiefly
used
to
sit
and
darn
and
fatten
household
sinners
in
brief
potential
faculty
in
everything
of
abdicating
power
in
it
she
owned
she
liked
a
woman
to
be
womanly
and
english
women
she
thanked
god
and
sighed
some
people
always
sigh
in
thanking
god
were
models
to
the
universe
and
last
i
learnt
because
she
did
not
like
to
see
me
wear
the
night
with
empty
hands
nothing
so
my
shepherdess
was
something
after
all
the
pastoral
saints
be
praised
for
t
leaning
lovelorn
with
pink
eyes
to
match
her
shoes
when
i
mistook
the
silks
her
head
uncrushed
by
that
round
weight
of
hat
so
strangely
similar
to
the
which
slew
the
tragic
poet
by
the
way
the
works
of
women
are
symbolical
we
sew
sew
prick
our
fingers
dull
our
sight
producing
what
a
pair
of
slippers
sir
to
put
on
when
you
re
a
stool
to
stumble
over
and
vex
you
curse
that
stool
or
else
at
best
a
cushion
where
you
lean
and
sleep
and
dream
of
something
we
are
not
but
would
be
for
your
sake
alas
alas
this
hurts
most
this
that
after
all
we
are
paid
the
worth
of
our
work
perhaps
in
looking
down
those
years
of
education
to
return
i
wonder
if
brinvilliers
suffered
more
in
the
flood
succeeding
flood
to
drench
the
incapable
throat
and
split
the
veins
than
i
did
certain
of
your
feebler
souls
go
out
in
such
a
process
many
pine
to
a
sick
inodorous
light
my
own
endured
i
had
relations
in
the
unseen
and
drew
the
elemental
nutriment
and
heat
from
nature
as
earth
feels
the
sun
at
nights
or
as
a
babe
sucks
surely
in
the
dark
i
kept
the
life
thrust
on
me
on
the
outside
of
the
inner
life
with
all
its
ample
room
for
heart
and
lungs
for
will
and
intellect
inviolable
by
conventions
god
i
thank
thee
for
that
grace
of
thine
at
first
i
felt
no
life
which
was
not
patience
the
thing
she
bade
me
without
heed
to
a
thing
beyond
it
sate
in
just
the
chair
she
placed
with
back
against
the
window
to
exclude
the
sight
of
the
great
on
the
lawn
which
seemed
to
have
come
on
purpose
from
the
woods
to
bring
the
house
a
message
and
walked
demurely
in
her
carpeted
low
rooms
as
if
i
should
not
harkening
my
own
steps
misdoubt
i
was
alive
i
read
her
books
was
civil
to
her
cousin
romney
leigh
gave
ear
to
her
vicar
tea
to
her
visitors
and
heard
them
whisper
when
i
changed
a
cup
i
blushed
for
joy
at
that
the
italian
child
for
all
her
blue
eyes
and
her
quiet
ways
thrives
ill
in
england
she
is
paler
yet
than
when
we
came
the
last
time
she
will
will
my
cousin
romney
leigh
blushed
too
with
sudden
anger
and
approaching
me
said
low
between
his
you
re
wicked
now
you
wish
to
die
and
leave
the
world
for
others
with
your
naughty
light
blown
out
i
looked
into
his
face
defyingly
he
might
have
known
that
being
what
i
was
twas
natural
to
like
to
get
away
as
far
as
dead
folk
can
and
then
indeed
some
people
make
no
trouble
when
they
die
he
turned
and
went
abruptly
slammed
the
door
and
shut
his
dog
out
romney
romney
leigh
i
have
not
named
my
cousin
hitherto
and
yet
i
used
him
as
a
sort
of
friend
my
elder
by
few
years
but
cold
and
shy
and
absent
tender
when
he
thought
of
it
which
scarcely
was
imperative
grave
betimes
as
well
as
early
master
of
leigh
hall
whereof
the
nightmare
sate
upon
his
youth
repressing
all
its
seasonable
delights
and
agonising
with
a
ghastly
sense
of
universal
hideous
want
and
wrong
to
incriminate
possession
when
he
came
from
college
to
the
country
very
oft
he
crossed
the
hills
on
visits
to
my
aunt
with
gifts
of
blue
grapes
from
the
hothouses
a
book
in
one
hand
statistics
if
i
chanced
to
lift
the
cover
count
of
all
the
goats
whose
beards
are
sprouting
down
toward
hell
against
god
s
separating
and
she
she
almost
loved
him
allowed
that
sometimes
he
should
seem
to
sigh
my
way
it
made
him
easier
to
be
pitiful
and
sighing
was
his
gift
so
undisturbed
at
whiles
she
let
him
shut
my
music
up
and
push
my
needles
down
and
lead
me
out
to
see
in
that
south
angle
of
the
house
the
figs
grow
black
as
if
by
a
tuscan
rock
on
some
light
pretext
she
would
turn
her
head
at
other
moments
go
to
fetch
a
thing
and
leave
me
breath
enough
to
speak
with
him
for
his
sake
it
was
simple
sometimes
too
he
would
have
saved
me
utterly
it
seemed
he
stood
and
looked
so
once
he
stood
so
near
he
dropped
a
sudden
hand
upon
my
head
bent
down
on
woman
s
work
as
soft
as
but
then
i
rose
and
shook
it
off
as
fire
the
stranger
s
touch
that
took
my
father
s
place
yet
dared
seem
soft
i
used
him
for
a
friend
before
i
ever
knew
him
for
a
friend
twas
better
twas
worse
also
afterward
we
came
so
close
we
saw
our
differences
too
intimately
always
romney
leigh
was
looking
for
the
worms
i
for
the
gods
a
godlike
nature
his
the
gods
look
down
incurious
of
themselves
and
certainly
tis
well
i
should
remember
how
those
days
i
was
a
worm
too
and
he
looked
on
me
a
little
by
his
act
perhaps
yet
more
by
something
in
me
surely
not
my
will
i
did
not
die
but
slowly
as
one
in
swoon
to
whom
life
creeps
back
in
the
form
of
death
with
a
sense
of
separation
a
blind
pain
of
blank
obstruction
and
a
roar
i
the
ears
of
visionary
chariots
which
retreat
as
earth
grows
clearer
slowly
by
degrees
i
woke
rose
up
where
was
i
in
the
world
for
uses
therefore
i
must
count
worth
while
i
had
a
little
chamber
in
the
house
as
green
as
any
a
bird
might
choose
to
build
in
though
the
nest
itself
could
show
but
sticks
and
straws
the
walls
were
green
the
carpet
was
pure
green
the
straight
small
bed
was
curtained
greenly
and
the
folds
hung
green
about
the
window
which
let
in
the
world
with
all
its
greenery
you
could
not
push
your
head
out
and
escape
a
dash
of
from
the
honeysuckle
but
so
you
were
baptised
into
the
grace
and
privilege
of
seeing
first
the
lime
i
had
enough
there
of
the
lime
be
sure
my
was
often
hummed
away
by
the
bees
in
it
past
the
lime
the
lawn
which
after
sweeping
broadly
round
the
house
went
trickling
through
the
shrubberies
in
a
stream
of
tender
turf
and
wore
and
lost
itself
among
the
acacias
over
which
you
saw
the
irregular
line
of
elms
by
the
deep
lane
which
stopped
the
grounds
and
dammed
the
overflow
of
arbutus
and
laurel
out
of
sight
the
lane
was
sunk
so
deep
no
foreign
tramp
nor
drover
of
wild
ponies
out
of
wales
could
guess
if
lady
s
hall
or
tenant
s
lodge
dispensed
such
odours
his
stick
might
reach
the
lowest
trail
of
blossoming
briar
which
dipped
upon
the
wall
behind
the
elms
and
through
their
tops
you
saw
the
folded
hills
striped
up
and
down
with
hedges
burly
oaks
projecting
from
the
lines
to
show
themselves
through
which
my
cousin
romney
s
chimneys
smoked
as
still
as
when
a
silent
mouth
in
frost
where
the
woodlands
hid
leigh
hall
while
far
above
a
jut
of
a
promontory
without
water
stretched
you
could
not
catch
it
if
the
days
were
thick
or
took
it
for
a
cloud
but
otherwise
the
vigorous
sun
would
catch
it
up
at
eve
and
use
it
for
an
anvil
till
he
had
filled
the
shelves
of
heaven
with
burning
thunderbolts
and
proved
he
need
not
rest
so
early
when
all
his
setting
trouble
was
resolved
to
a
trance
of
passive
glory
you
might
see
in
apparition
on
the
golden
sky
alas
my
giotto
s
background
the
sheep
run
along
the
fine
clear
outline
small
as
mice
that
run
along
a
witch
s
scarlet
thread
not
a
grand
nature
not
my
of
vallombrosa
cleaving
by
the
spurs
to
the
precipices
not
my
headlong
leaps
of
waters
that
cry
out
for
joy
or
fear
in
leaping
through
the
palpitating
pines
like
a
white
soul
tossed
out
to
eternity
with
thrills
of
time
upon
it
not
indeed
my
multitudinous
mountains
sitting
in
the
magic
circle
with
the
mutual
touch
electric
panting
from
their
full
deep
hearts
beneath
the
influent
heavens
and
waiting
for
communion
and
commission
italy
is
one
thing
england
one
on
english
ground
you
understand
the
letter
ere
the
fall
how
adam
lived
in
a
garden
all
the
fields
are
tied
up
fast
with
hedges
the
hills
are
crumpled
plains
plains
parterres
the
trees
round
woolly
ready
to
be
clipped
and
if
you
seek
for
any
wilderness
you
find
at
best
a
park
a
nature
tamed
and
grown
domestic
like
a
fowl
which
does
not
awe
you
with
its
claws
and
beak
nor
tempt
you
to
an
eyrie
too
high
up
but
which
in
cackling
sets
you
thinking
of
your
eggs
at
breakfast
in
the
pause
of
finer
meditation
rather
say
a
sweet
familiar
nature
stealing
in
as
a
dog
might
or
child
to
touch
your
hand
or
pluck
your
gown
and
humbly
mind
you
so
of
presence
and
affection
excellent
for
inner
uses
from
the
things
without
i
could
not
be
unthankful
i
who
was
entreated
thus
and
holpen
in
the
room
i
speak
of
ere
the
house
was
well
awake
and
also
after
it
was
well
asleep
i
sate
alone
and
drew
the
blessing
in
of
all
that
nature
with
a
gradual
step
a
stir
among
the
leaves
a
breath
a
ray
it
came
in
softly
while
the
angels
made
a
place
for
it
beside
me
the
moon
came
and
swept
my
chamber
clean
of
foolish
thoughts
the
sun
came
saying
shall
i
lift
this
light
against
the
and
you
will
not
look
i
make
the
birds
but
for
you
god
never
hears
your
voice
excepting
when
you
lie
upon
the
bed
at
nights
and
then
something
moved
me
then
i
wakened
up
more
slowly
than
i
verily
write
now
but
wholly
at
last
i
wakened
opened
wide
the
window
and
my
soul
and
let
the
airs
and
sights
sweep
gradual
gospels
in
regenerating
what
i
was
o
life
how
oft
we
throw
it
off
and
think
enough
enough
of
life
in
so
much
s
a
cause
for
rupture
we
must
break
with
life
or
be
ourselves
unworthy
here
we
are
wronged
maimed
spoiled
for
aspiration
farewell
life
so
as
froward
babes
we
hide
our
eyes
and
think
all
life
calls
to
us
in
some
transformed
apocryphal
new
voice
above
us
or
below
us
or
around
perhaps
we
name
it
nature
s
voice
or
love
s
tricking
ourselves
because
we
are
more
ashamed
to
own
our
compensations
than
our
griefs
still
life
s
voice
we
make
our
peace
with
life
and
i
so
young
then
was
not
sullen
soon
i
used
to
get
up
early
just
to
sit
and
watch
the
morning
quicken
in
the
grey
and
hear
the
silence
open
like
a
flower
leaf
after
leaf
stroke
with
listless
hand
the
woodbine
through
the
window
till
at
last
i
came
to
do
it
with
a
sort
of
love
at
foolish
unaware
whereat
i
smiled
a
melancholy
smile
to
catch
myself
smiling
for
joy
capacity
for
joy
admits
temptation
it
seemed
next
worth
while
to
dodge
the
sharp
sword
set
against
my
life
to
slip
down
stairs
through
all
the
sleepy
house
as
mute
as
any
dream
there
and
escape
as
a
soul
from
the
body
out
of
doors
glide
through
the
shrubberies
drop
into
the
lane
and
wander
on
the
hills
an
hour
or
two
then
back
again
before
the
house
should
stir
or
else
i
sate
on
in
my
chamber
green
and
lived
my
life
and
thought
my
thoughts
and
prayed
my
prayers
without
the
vicar
read
my
books
without
considering
whether
they
were
fit
to
do
me
good
mark
there
we
get
no
good
by
being
ungenerous
even
to
a
book
and
calculating
profits
so
much
help
by
so
much
reading
it
is
rather
when
we
gloriously
forget
ourselves
and
plunge
headlong
into
a
book
s
profound
impassioned
for
its
beauty
and
salt
of
tis
then
we
get
the
right
good
from
a
book
i
read
much
what
my
father
taught
before
from
many
a
volume
love
upon
the
pages
theophrast
grew
tender
with
the
memory
of
his
eyes
and
ælian
made
mine
wet
the
trick
of
greek
and
latin
he
had
taught
me
as
he
would
have
taught
me
wrestling
or
the
game
of
fives
if
such
he
had
known
like
a
shipwrecked
man
who
heaps
his
single
platter
with
goats
cheese
and
scarlet
berries
or
like
any
man
who
loves
but
one
and
so
gives
all
at
once
because
he
has
it
rather
than
because
he
counts
it
worthy
thus
my
father
gave
and
thus
as
did
the
women
formerly
by
young
achilles
when
they
pinned
the
veil
across
the
boy
s
audacious
front
and
swept
with
tuneful
laughs
the
rocks
he
wrapt
his
little
daughter
in
his
large
man
s
doublet
careless
did
it
fit
or
no
but
after
i
had
read
for
memory
i
read
for
hope
the
path
my
father
s
foot
had
trod
me
out
which
suddenly
broke
off
what
time
he
dropped
the
wallet
of
the
flesh
and
passed
alone
i
carried
on
and
set
my
gainst
the
thorny
underwood
to
reach
the
grassy
shelter
of
the
trees
ah
babe
i
the
wood
without
a
my
own
like
the
bird
flies
back
to
cover
all
that
past
with
leaves
sublimest
danger
over
which
none
weeps
when
any
young
wayfaring
soul
goes
forth
alone
unconscious
of
the
perilous
road
the
dazzling
in
his
limpid
eyes
to
thrust
his
own
way
he
an
alien
through
the
world
of
books
ah
you
think
it
fine
you
clap
a
fair
day
cheer
him
on
as
if
the
worst
could
happen
were
to
rest
too
long
beside
a
fountain
yet
behold
behold
world
of
books
is
still
the
world
and
worldlings
in
it
are
less
merciful
and
more
puissant
for
the
wicked
there
are
winged
like
angels
every
knife
that
strikes
is
edged
from
elemental
fire
to
assail
a
spiritual
life
the
beautiful
seems
right
by
force
of
beauty
and
the
feeble
wrong
because
of
weakness
power
is
justified
though
armed
against
michael
many
a
crown
covers
bald
foreheads
in
the

there
s
no

neither
of

grows

other
side
the
line
made
atheist
by

moral
books
exasperating
to
license
genial
books
discounting
from
the
human
dignity
and
merry
books
which
set
you
weeping
when
the
sun
shines
and
melancholy
books
which
make
you
laugh
that
any
one
should
weep
in
this
disjointed
life
for
one
wrong
more
the
world
of
books
is
still
the
world
i
write
and
both
worlds
have
god
s
providence
thank
god
to
keep
and
hearten
with
some
struggle
indeed
among
the
breakers
some
hard
swimming
through
the
lost
breath
in
my
soul
sometimes
and
cried
god
save
me
if
there
s
any
god
but
even
so
god
saved
me
and
being
dashed
from
error
on
to
error
every
turn
still
brought
me
nearer
to
the
central
truth
i
thought
so
all
this
anguish
in
the
thick
of
men
s
opinions
press
and
counterpress
now
up
now
down
now
underfoot
and
now
emergent
all
the
best
of
it
perhaps
but
throws
you
back
upon
a
noble
trust
and
use
of
your
own
instinct
proves
pure
reason
stronger
than
bare
inference
at
strongest
try
it
against
heaven
s
wall
your
scaling
ladders
of
high
step
by
step
goes
faster
that
still
ray
which
strikes
out
from
you
how
you
can
not
tell
and
why
you
know
did
you
eliminate
that
such
as
you
indeed
should
analyse
goes
straight
and
fast
as
light
and
high
as
god
the
cygnet
finds
the
water
but
the
man
is
born
in
ignorance
of
his
element
and
feels
out
blind
at
first
disorganised
by
sin
i
the
blood
dulled
and
crossed
by
his
sensations
presently
we
feel
it
quicken
in

dark

then

obedient
for
those

defiled
erased
and
covered
by
a
monk
s
the
apocalypse
by
a
longus
poring
on
which
obscene
text
we
may
discern
perhaps
some
fair
fine
trace
of
what
was
written
once
some
upstroke
of
an
alpha
and
omega
expressing
the
old
scripture

had
found
the
secret
of
a
piled
high
with
cases
in
my
father
s
name
piled
high
packed
large
creeping
in
and
out
among
the
giant
fossils
of
my
past
like
some
small
nimble
mouse
between
the
ribs
of
a
mastodon
i
nibbled
here
and
there
at
this
or
that
box
pulling
through
the
gap
in
heats
of
terror
haste
victorious
joy
the
first

and
how
i
felt
it
beat
under
my
pillow
in
the
morning
s
dark
an
hour
before
the
sun
would
let
me
read
my
books
at
last
because
the
time
was
ripe
i
chanced
upon
the
poets
as
the
earth
plunges
in
fury
when
the
internal
fires
have
reached
and
pricked
her
heart
and
throwing
flat
the
marts
and
temples
the
triumphal
gates
and
towers
of
observation
clears
herself
to
elemental
my
soul
at
poetry
s
divine
first
let
go
conventions
and
sprang
up
surprised
convicted
of
the
great
eternities
before
two
worlds
what
s
this
aurora
leigh
you
write
so
of
the
poets
and
not
laugh
those
virtuous
liars
dreamers
after
dark
exaggerators
of
the
sun
and
moon
and
soothsayers
in
a
i
write
so
of
the
only
now
left
to
god
the
only
speakers
of
essential
truth
opposed
to
relative
comparative
and
temporal
truths
the
only
holders
by
his
through
conventional
grey
glooms
the
only
teachers
who
instruct
mankind
from
just
a
shadow
on
a

find
man
s
veritable
stature
out
erect
sublime
measure
of
a
man

that

the
measure
of

the
apostle

and
while
your
common
men
build
pyramids
gauge
railroads
reign
reap
dine
and
dust
the
flaunty
carpets
of
the
world
for
kings
to
walk
on
or
our
senators
the
poet
suddenly
will
catch
them
up
with
his
voice
like
a
thunder
this

this
is

this
word
is
being
said
in

down
on
us
what
are
you
about
how
all
those
workers
start
amid
their
work
look
round
look
up
and
feel
a
moment
s
space
that
though
a
pretty
trade
is
not
the
imperative
labour
after
all
my
own
best
poets
am
i
one
with
you
that
thus
i
love
you
but
one
through
love
does
all
this
smell
of
thyme
about
my
feet
conclude
my
visit
to
your
holy
hill
in
personal
presence
or
but
testify
the
rustling
of
your
vesture
through
my
dreams
with
influent
odours
when
my
joy
and
pain
my
thought
and
aspiration
like
the
stops
of
pipe
or
flute
are
absolutely
dumb
if
not
melodious
do
you
play
on
me
my
pipers
if
sooth
you
did
not
blow
would
no
sound
come
or
is
the
music

as
a
man

or

is
called

own
inbreathed
by
the
there
s
a
doubt
for
cloudy
seasons
but
the
sun
was
high
when
first
i
felt
my
pulses
set
themselves
for
concords
when
the
rhythmic
turbulence
of
blood
and
brain
swept
outward
upon
words
as
wind
upon
the
alders
blanching
them
by
turning
up
their
till
they
trembled
in
dilation
o
delight
and
triumph
of
the
poet
would
say
a
man
s
mere
yes
a
woman
s
common
no
a
little
human
hope
of
that
or
this
and
says
the
word
so
that
it
burns
you
through
with
a
special
revelation
shakes
the
heart
of
all
the
men
and
women
in
the
world
as
if
one
came
back
from
the
dead
and
spoke
with
eyes
too
happy
a
familiar
thing
become
divine
i
the
utterance
while
for
him
the
poet
the
speaker
he
expands
with
joy
the
palpitating
angel
in
his
flesh
thrills
inly
with
consenting
fellowship
to
those
innumerous
spirits
who
sun
themselves
outside

my
eagle
with
both
grappling
feet
still
hot
from
zeus
s
thunder
who
has
ravished
me
away
from
all
the
shepherds
sheep
and
dogs
and
set
me
in
the
olympian
roar
and
round
of
luminous
faces
for
a
to
keep
the
mouths
of
all
the
godheads
moist
for
everlasting
laughters
myself
half
drunk
across
the
beaker
with
their
eyes
how
those
gods
look
enough
so
ganymede
we
shall
not
bear
above
a
round
or
we
drop
the
golden
cup
at
heré
s
foot
and
swoon
back
to
the
earth
find
ourselves
among
the
cold
with
dew
while
the
dogs
bark
and
many
a
shepherd
scoffs
what

come
now
to
the
youth
such
ups

downs
have
poets
am
i
such
indeed
the
name
is
royal
and
to
sign
it
like
a
queen
is
what
i
dare
not
some
royal
blood
would
seem
to
tingle
in
me
now
and
then
with
sense
of
power
and
ache

and
manias
usual
to
the
race
howbeit
i
dare
not
tis
too
easy
to
go
mad
and
ape
a
bourbon
in
a
crown
of
straws
the
thing

too
common
many
fervent
souls
strike
rhyme
on
rhyme
who
would
strike
steel
on
steel
if
steel
had
offered
in
a
restless
heat
of
doing
something
many
tender
souls
have
strung
their
losses
on
a
rhyming
thread
as
children
cowslips
more
pains
they
take
the
work
more
withers
young
men
ay
and
maids
too
often
sow
their
wild
oats
in
tame
verse
before
they
sit
down
under
their
own
vine
and
live
for
use
alas
near
all
the
birds
will
sing
at
dawn
yet
we
do
not
take
the
chaffering
swallow
for
the
holy
lark
in
those
days
though
i
never
analysed
myself
even
all
analysis
comes
late
you
catch
a
sight
of
nature
earliest
in
full
front
and
your
eyelids
wink
and
drop
before
the
wonder
of
t
you
miss
the
form
through
seeing
the
light
i
lived
those
days
and
wrote
because
i
else
my
heart
beat
in
my
brain
life
s
violent
flood
abolished
bounds
which
my
neighbour

field
which
mine
what
mattered
it
is
so
in
youth
we
play
at
over
the
god
term
the
love
within
us
and
the
love
without
are
mixed
confounded
if
we
are
loved
or
love
we
scarce
distinguish
so
with
other
power
being
acted
on
and
acting
seem
the
same
in
that
first
onrush
of
life
s
we
know
not
if
the
forests
move
or
we
and
so
like
most
young
poets
in
a
flush
of
individual
life
i
poured
myself
along
the
veins
of
others
and
achieved
mere
lifeless
imitations
of
live
verse
and
made
the
living
answer
for
the
dead
profaning
nature
touch
not
do
not
taste
nor
handle
re
too
legal
who
write
young
we
beat
the
phorminx
till
we
hurt
our
thumbs
as
if
still
ignorant
of
counterpoint
we
call
the
muse
o
muse
benignant
muse
as
if
we
had
seen
her
head
with
the
eyes
in
it
start
between
the
boughs
as
often
as
a
stag
s
what
with
so
much
earnest
what
effete
results
from
virile
efforts
what
cold
odes
from
such
white
heats
where
the
cows
would
scare
the
writer
if
they
splashed
the
mud
in
lashing
off
the
flies
driven
against
the
heels
of
what
the
master
said
and
counterfeiting
epics
shrill
with
trumps
a
babe
might
blow
between
two
straining
cheeks
of
bubbled
rose
to
make
his
mother
laugh
and
elegiac
griefs
and
songs
of
love
like
nosegays
picked
up
on
the
road
the
worse
for
being
warm
all
these
things
writ
on
happy
mornings
with
a
morning

for

for

for

oft
the
ancient
forms
will
thrill
indeed
in
carrying
the
young
blood
the
now

then
a
little
warped
will
crack
even
as
the
new
wine
gurgles
in
spare
the
old
bottles
not
the
new
wine
by
keats
s
soul
the
man
who
never
stepped
in
gradual
progress
like
another
man
but
turning
grandly
on
his
central
self
ensphered
himself
in
twenty
perfect
years
and
died
not
young
the
life
of
a
long
life
distilled
to
a
mere
drop
falling
like
a
tear
upon
the
world
s
cold
cheek
to
make
it
burn
for
ever
by
that
strong
excepted
soul
i
count
it
strange
and
hard
to
understand
that
nearly
all
young
poets
should
write
old
that
pope
was
sexagenarian
at
sixteen
and
beardless
byron
academical
and
so
with
others
it
may
be
perhaps
such
have
not
settled
long
and
deep
enough
in
trance
to
attain
to
clairvoyance
still
the
memory
mixes
with
the
vision

and
works
it
turbid
or
perhaps
again
in
order
to
discover
the
the
melancholy
desert
must
sweep
round
behind
you
as
for
me
i
wrote
false
poems
like
the
rest
and
thought
them
true
because
myself
was
true
in
writing
them
i
peradventure
have
writ
true
ones
since
with
less
complacence
but
i
could
not
hide
my
quickening
inner
life
from
those
at
watch
they
saw
a
light
at
a
window
now
and
then
they
had
not
set
there
who
had
set
it
there
my
father
s
sister
started
when
she
caught
my
soul
agaze
in
my
eyes
she
could
not
say
i
had
no
business
with
a
sort
of
soul
but
plainly
she
objected
demurred
that
souls
were
dangerous
things
to
carry
straight
through
all
the
spilt
saltpetre
of
the
world
she
said
sometimes
aurora
have
you
done
your
task
this
morning
you
read
that
book
and
are
you
ready
for
the
crochet
here
as
if
she
said
i
know
there
s
something
wrong
i
know
i
have
not
ground
you
down
enough
to
flatten
and
bake
you
to
a
wholesome
crust
for
household
uses
and
proprieties
before
the
rain
has
got
into
my
barn
and
set
the
grains
what
you
re
green
with
impudence
you
almost
grow
to
which
i
answered
would
she
hear
my
task
and
verify
my
abstract
of
the
book
and
should
i
sit
down
to
the
crochet
work
was
such
her
pleasure
then
i
sate
and
teased
the
patient
needle
till
it
spilt
the
thread
which
oozed
off
from
it
in
meandering
lace
from
hour
to
hour
i
was
not
therefore
sad
my
soul
was
singing
at
a
work
apart
behind
the
wall
of
sense
as
safe
from
harm
as
sings
the
lark
when
sucked
up
out
of
sight
in
vortices
of
glory
and
blue
air
and
so
through
forced
work
and
spontaneous
work
the
inner
life
informed
the
outer
life
reduced
the
irregular
blood
to
settled
rhythms
made
cool
the
forehead
with
dreams
and
rounding
to
the
spheric
soul
the
thin
pined
body
struck
a
colour
up
the
cheeks
though
somewhat
faint
i
clenched
my
brows
across
my
blue
eyes
greatening
in
the
and
said
we
ll
live
aurora
we
ll
be
strong
the
dogs
are
on
we
will
not
whoever
lives
true
life
will
love
true
love
i
learnt
to
love
that
england
very
oft
before
the
day
was
born
or
otherwise
through
secret
windings
of
the
afternoons
i
threw
my
hunters
off
and
plunged
myself
among
the
deep
hills
as
a
hunted
stag
will
take
the
waters
shivering
with
the
fear
and
passion
of
the
course
and
when
at
last
escaped
many
a
green
slope
built
on
slope
betwixt
me
and
the
enemy
s
house
behind
i
dared
to
rest
or
wander
a
rest
made
sweeter
for
the
step
upon
the
grass
and
view
the
ground
s
most
gentle
dimplement
as
if
god
s
finger
touched
but
did
not
press
in
making
england
such
an
up
and
down
of
verdure
too
much
up
or
down
a
ripple
of
land
such
little
hills
the
sky
can
stoop
to
tenderly
and
the
wheatfields
climb
such
nooks
of
valleys
lined
with
orchises
fed
full
of
noises
by
invisible
streams
and
open
pastures
where
you
scarcely
tell
white
daisies
from
white
dew
intervals
the
mythic
oaks
and
standing
out
upon
their
prodigy
of
shade
i
thought
my
father
s
land
was
worthy
too
of
being
my
shakspeare
s
very
oft
alone
unlicensed
not
unfrequently
with
leave
to
walk
the
third
with
romney
and
his
friend
the
rising
painter
vincent
carrington
whom
men
judge
hardly
as
because
he
holds
that
paint
a
body
well
you
paint
a
soul
by
implication
like
the
grand
first
master
pleasant
walks
for
if
he
said
when
i
was
last
in
italy
it
sounded
as
an
instrument
that
s
played
too
far
off
for
the
yet
it
s
fine
to
listen
ofter
we
walked
only
two
if
cousin
romney
pleased
to
walk
with
me
we
read
or
talked
or
quarrelled
as
it
chanced
we
were
not
lovers
nor
even
friends
say
rather
scholars
upon
different
tracks
and
thinkers
disagreed
he
overfull
of
what
is
and
i
haply
overbold
for
what
might
be
but
then
the
thrushes
sang
and
shook
my
pulses
and
the
elms
new
leaves
and
then
i
turned
and
held
my
finger
up
and
bade
him
mark
that
howsoe
er
the
world
went
ill
as
he
related
certainly
the
thrushes
still
sang
in
which
word
his
brow
would
soften
he
bore
with
me
in
melancholy
patience
not
unkind
while
breaking
into
voluble
ecstacy
i
flattered
all
the
beauteous
country
round
as
poets
use
the
skies
the
clouds
the
fields
the
happy
violets
hiding
from
the
roads
the
primroses
run
down
to
carrying
gold
the
tangled
hedgerows
where
the
cows
push
out
impatient
horns
and
tolerant
churning
mouths
twixt
dripping
all
alive
with
birds
and
gnats
and
large
white
butterflies
which
look
as
if
the
had
caught
life
and
palpitated
forth
upon
the
wind
hills
vales
woods
netted
in
a
silver
mist
farms
granges
doubled
up
among
the
hills
and
cattle
grazing
in
the
watered
vales
and
smoking
from
the
woods
and
smelling
everywhere
confused
with
smell
of
orchards
see
i
said
and
see
is
god
not
with
us
on
the
earth
and
shall
we
put
him
down
by
aught
we
do
who
says
there
s
nothing
for
the
poor
and
vile
save
poverty
and
wickedness
behold
and
in
english
grass
i
leaped
and
clapped
my
hands
and
called
all
very
fair
in
the
beginning
when
god
called
all
good
even
then
was
evil
near
us
it
is
writ
but
we
indeed
who
call
things
good
and
fair
the
evil
is
upon
us
while
we
speak
deliver
us
from
evil
let
us
pray
second
book
times
followed
one
another
came
a
morn
i
stood
upon
the
brink
of
twenty
years
and
looked
before
and
after
as
i
stood
woman
and
artist
incomplete
both
credulous
of
completion
there
i
held
the
whole
creation
in
my
little
cup
and
smiled
with
thirsty
lips
before
i
drank
good
health
to
you
and
me
sweet
neighbour
mine
and
all
these
i
was
glad
that
day
the
june
was
in
me
with
its
multitudes
of
nightingales
all
singing
in
the
dark
and
rosebuds
reddening
where
the
calyx
split
i
felt
so
young
so
strong
so
sure
of
god
so
glad
i
could
not
choose
be
very
wise
and
old
at
twenty
was
inclined
to
pull
my
childhood
backward
in
a
childish
jest
to
see
the
face
of
t
once
more
and
farewell
in
which
fantastic
mood
i
bounded
forth
at
early
morning
not
wait
so
long
as
even
to
snatch
my
bonnet
by
the
strings
but
brushing
a
green
trail
across
the
lawn
with
my
gown
in
the
dew
took
will
and
way
among
the
acacias
of
the
shrubberies
to
fly
my
fancies
in
the
open
air
and
keep
my
birthday
till
my
aunt
awoke
to
stop
good
dreams
meanwhile
i
murmured
on
as
honeyed
bees
keep
humming
to
themselves
the
worthiest
poets
have
remained
uncrowned
till
death
has
bleached
their
foreheads
to
the
bone
and
so
with
me
it
must
be
unless
i
prove
unworthy
of
the
grand
adversity
and
certainly
i
would
not
fail
so
much
what
therefore
if
i
crown
myself
in
sport
not
pride
to
learn
the
feel
of
it
before
my
brows
be
numb
as
dante
s
own
to
all
the
tender
pricking
of
such
leaves
such
leaves
what
leaves
i
pulled
the
branches
down
to
choose
from
not
the
bay
i
choose
no
bay
the
fates
deny
us
if
we
are
overbold
nor
means
chiefly
love
and
love
is
something
awful
which
one
dares
not
touch
so
early
o
mornings
this
verbena
strains
the
point
of
passionate
fragrance
and
hard
by
this
at
far
too
slight
a
beck
of
the
wind
will
toss
about
her
s
my
choice
ivy
on
the
wall
that
headlong
ivy
not
a
leaf
will
grow
but
thinking
of
a
wreath
large
leaves
smooth
leaves
serrated
like
my
vines
and
half
as
green
i
like
such
ivy
bold
to
leap
a
height
twas
strong
to
climb
as
good
to
grow
on
graves
as
twist
about
a
thyrsus
pretty
too
and
that
s
not
ill
when
twisted
round
a
comb
thus
speaking
to
myself
half
singing
it
because
some
thoughts
are
fashioned
like
a
bell
to
ring
with
once
being
touched
i
drew
a
wreath
drenched
blinding
me
with
dew
across
my
brow
and
fastening
it
behind
so
turning
faced
my
public
a
mouth
twice
graver
than
his
eyes
i
stood
there
my
arms
up
like
the
caryatid
sole
of
some
abolished
temple
helplessly
persistent
in
a
gesture
which
derides
a
former
purpose
yet
my
blush
was
flame
as
if
from
flax
not
stone
aurora
leigh
the
earliest
of
auroras
hand
stretched
out
i
clasped
as
shipwrecked
men
will
clasp
a
hand
indifferent
to
the
sort
of
palm
the
tide
had
caught
me
at
my
pastime
writing
down
my
foolish
name
too
near
upon
the
sea
which
drowned
me
with
a
blush
as
foolish
you
my
cousin
the
smile
died
out
in
his
eyes
and
dropped
upon
his
lips
a
cold
dead
weight
for
just
a
moment
here
s
a
book
i
found
no
name
writ
on
by
the
form
some
greek
upon
the
margin
s
greek
without
the
accents
read
it
not
a
word
i
saw
at
once
the
thing
had
witchcraft
in
t
whereof
the
reading
calls
up
dangerous
spirits
i
rather
bring
it
to
the
my
book
you
found
it
in
the
hollow
by
the
stream
that
beech
leans
down
which
you
said
the
oread
in
it
has
a
naiad
s
heart
and
pines
for
thank
rather
my
cousin
that
i
have
seen
you
not
too
much
a
witch
a
poet
scholar
and
the
rest
to
be
a
woman
with
a
glance
the
smile
rose
in
his
eyes
again
and
touched
the
ivy
on
my
forehead
light
as
air
i
answered
gravely
poets
needs
must
be
or
men
or
s
the
ah
but
men
and
still
less
women
happily
scarce
need
be
poets
keep
to
the
green
wreath
since
even
dreaming
of
the
stone
and
bronze
brings
headaches
pretty
cousin
and
defiles
the
clean
white
morning
so
you
judge
because
i
love
the
beautiful
i
must
love
pleasure
chiefly
and
be
overcharged
for
ease
and
whiteness
know
the
world
and
only
miss
your
cousin
tis
not
much
but
learn
this
i
would
rather
take
my
part
with
god
s
dead
who
afford
to
walk
in
white
yet
spread
his
glory
than
keep
quiet
here
and
gather
up
my
feet
from
even
a
step
for
fear
to
soil
my
gown
in
so
much
dust
i
choose
to
walk
at
all
if
heads
that
hold
a
rhythmic
thought
must
ache
perforce
for
my
part
i
choose
headaches
today
s
my
dear
aurora
choose
instead
to
cure
such
you
have
i
perceive
the
headache
is
too
noble
for
my
sex
you
think
the
heartache
would
sound
decenter
since
that
s
the
woman
s
special
proper
ache
and
altogether
tolerable
except
to
a
saying
which
i
loosed
my
wreath
and
swinging
it
beside
me
as
i
walked
half
petulant
half
playful
as
we
walked
i
sent
a
sidelong
look
to
find
his
thought
as
falcon
set
on
falconer
s
finger
may
with
sidelong
head
and
startled
braving
eye
which
means
you
ll
ll
see
i
ll
soon
take
you
shall
not
he
as
shaking
out
his
hand
and
answering
fly
then
did
not
speak
except
by
such
a
gesture
silently
we
paced
until
just
coming
into
sight
of
the
he
abruptly
caught
at
one
end
of
the
swinging
wreath
and
said
aurora
there
i
stopped
short
breath
and
all
aurora
let
s
be
serious
and
throw
by
this
game
of
head
and
heart
life
means
be
sure
both
heart
and
head
active
both
complete
and
both
in
earnest
men
and
women
make
the
world
as
head
and
heart
make
human
life
work
man
work
woman
since
there
s
work
to
do
in
this
beleaguered
earth
for
head
and
heart
and
thought
can
never
do
the
work
of
love
but
work
for
ends
i
mean
for
uses
not
for
such
sleek
fringes
do
you
call
them
ends
still
less
god
s
glory
as
we
sew
ourselves
upon
the
velvet
of
those
baldaquins
held
twixt
us
and
the
sun
that
book
of
yours
i
have
not
read
a
page
of
but
i
toss
a
rose
falls
calyx
down
you
see
the
chances
are
that
being
a
woman
young
and
pure
with
such
a
pair
of
large
calm
eyes
you
write
as
well
and
ill
upon
the
whole
as
other
women
if
as
well
what
then
if
even
a
little
better
still
what
then
we
want
the
best
in
art
now
or
no
art
the
time
is
done
for
facile
settings
up
of
minnow
gods
nymphs
here
and
tritons
there
the
polytheists
have
gone
out
in
god
that
unity
of
bests
no
best
no
god
and
so
with
art
we
say
give
art
s
divine
direct
indubitable
real
as
grief
or
leave
us
to
the
grief
we
grow
ourselves
divine
by
overcoming
with
mere
hope
and
most
prosaic
patience
you
you
are
young
as
eve
with

daybreak
on

face
but

which

still
beats
back
those
savage
hungry
dogs
that
hunt
her
down
to
the
empty
grave
of
christ
the
world

hard
pressed
the
sweat
of

the

turning
acrid
in
six
thousand
years

the
sweat
of
torture

to

done
some

if
that

it

measure
to
yourself
a

to
teach

none
of
all
these
things
can
women
understand
you
generalise
oh
nothing
even
grief
your
hearts
so
sympathetic
to
the
personal
pang
close
on
each
separate
yielding
up
a
whole
life
at
each
wound
incapable
of
deepening

lap
of

to
you
means
such
a
child
or
such
a
man
you
saw
one
morning
waiting
in
the
cold
beside
that
gate
perhaps
you
gather
up
a
few
such
cases
and
when
strong
sometimes
will
write
of
factories
and
of
slaves
as
if
your
father
were
a
negro
and
your
son
a
spinner
in
the
mills
all
s
yours
and
you
all
coloured
with
your
blood
or
otherwise
just
nothing
to
you
why
i
call
you
hard
to
general
suffering
here
s
the
world
half
blind
with
intellectual
light
half
brutalised
with
civilisation
having
caught
the
plague
in
silks
from
tarsus
shrieking
east
and
west
along
a
thousand
railroads
mad
with
pain
and
sin
too
does
one
woman
of
you
all
you
who
weep
easily
grow
pale
to
see
this
tiger
shake
his
cage
one
of
you
stand
still
from
dancing
stop
from
stringing
pearls
and
pine
and
die
because
of
the
great
sum
of
universal
anguish
me
a
tear
wet
as
cordelia
s
in
eyes
bright
as
yours
because
the
world
is
mad
you
can
not
count
that
you
should
weep
for
this
account
not
you
you
weep
for
what
you
know
a
child
sick
in
a
fever
if
you
touch
him
once
though
but
so
little
as
with
a
will
set
you
weeping
but
a
million
sick
you
could
as
soon
weep
for
the
rule
of
three
or
compound
fractions
therefore
this
same
world
uncomprehended
by
you
must
remain
uninfluenced
by
as
you
are
mere
women
personal
and
passionate
you
give
us
doating
mothers
and
chaste
wives
sublime
madonnas
and
enduring
saints
we
get
no
christ
from
you
verily
we
shall
not
get
a
poet
in
my
with
which
conclusion
you
conclude
but
that
you
aurora
with
the
large
live
brow
and
steady
eyelids
can
not
condescend
to
play
at
art
as
children
play
at
swords
to
show
a
pretty
spirit
chiefly
admired
because
true
action
is
impossible
you
never
can
be
satisfied
with
praise
which
men
give
women
when
they
judge
a
book
not
as
mere
work
but
as
mere
woman
s
work
expressing
the
comparative
respect
which
means
the
absolute
scorn
oh
excellent
what
grace
what
facile
turns
what
fluent
sweeps
what
delicate
discernment
almost
thought
the
book
does
honour
to
the
sex
we
hold
among
our
female
authors
we
make
room
for
this
fair
writer
and
congratulate
the
country
that
produces
in
these
times
such
women
competent
to
stop
there
i
through
his
thread
of
talk
with
a
quick
flame
of
emotion
you
have
read
my
soul
if
not
my
book
and
argue
well
i
would
not
condescend
we
will
not
say
to
such
a
kind
of
praise
a
worthless
end
is
praise
of
all
kinds
but
to
such
a
use
of
holy
art
and
golden
life
i
am
young
and
peradventure
tell
me
through
being
a
woman
and
for
all
the
rest
take
thanks
for
justice
i
would
rather
dance
at
fairs
on
till
the
babies
dropped
their
gingerbread
for
joy
shift
the
types
for
tolerable
verse
intolerable
to
men
who
act
and
suffer
better
far
pursue
a
frivolous
trade
by
serious
means
than
a
sublime
art
you
choose
nobler
work
than
either
o
moist
eyes
and
hurrying
lips
and
heaving
heart
we
are
young
aurora
you
and
i
the
world
look
round
the
world
we
re
come
to
late
is
swollen
hard
with
perished
generations
and
their
sins
the
civiliser
s
spade
grinds
horribly
on
dead
men
s
bones
and
can
not
turn
up
soil
that
s
otherwise
than
fetid
all
success
proves
partial
failure
all
advance
implies
what
s
left
behind
all
triumph
something
crushed
at
the
all
government
some
wrong
and
rich
men
make
the
poor
who
curse
the
rich
who
agonise
together
rich
and
poor
under
and
over
in
the
social
spasm
and
crisis
of
the
ages
here
s
an
age
that
makes
its
own
vocation
here
we
have
stepped
across
the
bounds
of
time
here
s
nought
to
see
but
just
the
rich
man
and
just
lazarus
and
both
in
torments
with
a
mediate
gulph
though
not
a
hint
of
abraham
s
bosom
who
being
man
and
human
can
stand
calmly
by
and
view
these
things
and
never
tease
his
soul
for
some
great
cure
no
physic
for
this
grief
in
all
the
earth
and
heavens
too
you
believe
in
god
for
your
part
that
he
who
makes
can
make
good
things
from
ill
things
best
from
worst
as
men
plant
tulips
upon
dunghills
when
they
wish
them
finest
true
a
is
the
same
as
to
be
accurate
and
in
all
nature
is
no
death
at
all
as
men
account
of
death
as
long
as
god
stands
witnessing
for
life
perpetually
by
being
just
god
that
s
abstract
truth
i
know
philosophy
or
sympathy
with
god
but
i
i
sympathise
with
man
not
god
i
think
i
was
a
man
for
chiefly
this
and
when
i
stand
beside
a
dying
bed
it
s
death
to
me
observe
had
not
much
consoled
the
race
of
mastodons
to
know
before
they
went
to
fossil
that
anon
their
place
should
quicken
with
the
elephant
they
were
not
elephants
but
mastodons
and
i
a
man
as
men
are
now
and
not
as
men
may
be
hereafter
feel
with
men
in
the
agonising
is
it
so
i
said
my
cousin
is
the
world
so
bad
while
i
hear
nothing
of
it
through
the
trees
the
world
was
always
evil
so
bad
so
bad
aurora
dear
my
soul
is
grey
with
poring
over
the
long
sum
of
ill
so
much
for
vice
so
much
for
discontent
so
much
for
the
necessities
of
power
so
much
for
the
connivances
of
fear
coherent
in
statistical
despairs
with
such
a
total
of
distracted
life
to
see
it
down
in
figures
on
a
page
plain
silent
clear
as
god
sees
through
the
earth
the
sense
of
all
the
graves
that
s
terrible
for
one
who
is
not
god
and
can
not
right
the
wrong
he
looks
on
may
i
choose
indeed
but
vow
away
my
years
my
means
my
aims
among
the
helpers
if
there
s
any
help
in
such
a
social
strait
the
common
blood
that
swings
along
my
veins
is
strong
enough
to
draw
me
to
this
then
i
spoke
i
have
not
stood
long
on
the
strand
of
life
and
these
salt
waters
have
had
scarcely
time
to
creep
so
high
up
as
to
wet
my
feet
i
can
not
judge
these
shall
perhaps
a
woman
s
always
younger
than
a
man
at
equal
years
because
she
is
disallowed
maturing
by
the
outdoor
sun
and
air
and
kept
in
past
the
age
to
walk
ah
well
i
know
you
men
judge
otherwise
you
think
a
woman
ripens
as
a
peach
the
cheeks
chiefly
pass
it
to
me
now
i
m
young
in
age
and
younger
still
i
think
as
a
woman
but
a
child
may
say
amen
to
a
bishop
s
prayer
and
see
the
way
it
goes
and
i
incapable
to
loose
the
knot
of
social
questions
can
approve
applaud
august
compassion
christian
thoughts
that
shoot
beyond
the
vulgar
white
of
personal
aims
accept
my
there
he
glowed
on
me
with
all
his
face
and
eyes
no
other
help
said
no
more
than
so
what
help
i
asked
you
d
scorn
my
help
nature
s
self
you
say
has
scorned
to
put
her
music
in
my
mouth
because
a
woman
s
do
you
now
turn
round
and
ask
for
what
a
woman
can
not
give
for
what
she
only
can
i
turn
and
ask
he
answered
catching
up
my
hands
in
his
and
dropping
on
me
from
his
brow
the
full
weight
of
his
soul
i
ask
for
love
and
that
she
can
for
life
in
fellowship
through
bitter
i
know
she
can
for
wifehood
will
she
now
i
said
may
god
be
witness
twixt
us
two
and
with
the
word
meseemed
i
floated
into
a
sudden
light
above
his
stature
am
i
proved
too
weak
to
stand
alone
yet
strong
enough
to
bear
such
leaners
on
my
shoulder
poor
to
think
yet
rich
enough
to
sympathise
with
thought
incompetent
to
sing
as
blackbirds
can
yet
competent
to
love
like
him
i
paused
perhaps
i
darkened
as
the
will
that
turns
upon
the
sea
it
s
always
so
anything
does
for
a
aurora
dear
and
dearly
honoured
he
pressed
in
at
once
with
eager
utterance
you
translate
me
ill
i
do
not
contradict
my
thought
of
you
which
is
most
reverent
with
another
thought
found
less
so
if
your
sex
is
weak
for
art
and
i
who
said
so
did
but
honour
you
by
using
truth
in
courtship
it
is
strong
for
life
and
duty
place
your
fecund
heart
in
mine
and
let
us
blossom
for
the
world
that
wants
love
s
colour
in
the
grey
of
time
with
all
my
talk
i
can
but
set
you
where
you
look
down
coldly
on
the
of
headless
bodies
shapeless
indistinct
the
scarce
would
find
his
way
through
such
a
heap
of
generalised
distress
to
the
individual
man
with
lips
and
much
less
aurora
ah
my
sweet
come
down
and
hand
in
hand
we
ll
go
where
yours
shall
touch
these
victims
one
by
one
till
one
by
one
the
formless
nameless
trunk
of
every
man
shall
seem
to
wear
a
head
with
hair
you
know
and
every
woman
catch
your
mother
s
face
to
melt
you
into
i
am
a
girl
i
answered
slowly
you
do
well
to
name
my
mother
s
face
though
far
too
early
alas
god
s
hand
did
interpose
twixt
it
and
me
i
know
so
much
of
love
as
used
to
shine
in
that
face
and
another
just
so
much
no
more
indeed
at
all
i
have
not
seen
so
much
love
since
i
pray
you
pardon
me
as
answers
even
to
make
a
marriage
with
in
this
cold
land
of
england
what
you
love
is
not
a
woman
romney
but
a
cause
you
want
a
helpmate
not
a
mistress
sir
a
wife
to
help
your
ends
in
her
no
end
your
cause
is
noble
your
ends
excellent
but
i
being
most
unworthy
of
these
and
that
do
otherwise
conceive
of
love
farewell
aurora
you
reject
me
thus
he
said
why
sir
you
are
married
long
ago
you
have
a
wife
already
whom
you
love
your
social
theory
bless
you
both
i
say
for
my
part
i
am
scarcely
meek
enough
to
be
the
handmaid
of
a
lawful
spouse
do
i
look
a
hagar
think
you
so
you
jest
nay
so
i
speak
in
earnest
i
replied
you
treat
of
marriage
too
much
like
at
least
a
chief
apostle
you
would
bear
with
you
a
wife
a
sister
shall
we
speak
it
out
a
sister
of
then
must
it
be
indeed
farewell
and
was
i
so
far
wrong
in
hope
and
in
illusion
when
i
took
the
woman
to
be
nobler
than
the
man
yourself
the
noblest
woman
the
use
and
comprehension
of
what
love
is
that
generates
the
likeness
of
itself
through
all
heroic
duties
so
far
wrong
in
saying
bluntly
venturing
truth
on
love
come
human
creature
love
and
work
with
me
instead
of
lady
thou
art
wondrous
fair
and
where
the
graces
walk
before
the
muse
will
follow
at
the
lighting
of
their
eyes
and
where
the
muse
walks
lovers
need
to
creep
turn
round
and
love
me
or
i
die
of
with
quiet
indignation
i
broke
in
you
misconceive
the
question
like
a
man
who
sees
a
woman
as
the
complement
of
his
sex
merely
you
forget
too
much
that
every
creature
female
as
the
male
stands
single
in
responsible
act
and
thought
as
also
in
birth
and
death
whoever
says
to
a
loyal
woman
love
and
work
with
me
will
get
fair
answers
if
the
work
and
love
being
good
themselves
are
good
for
best
she
was
born
for
women
of
a
softer
mood
surprised
by
men
when
scarcely
awake
to
life
will
sometimes
only
hear
the
first
word
love
and
catch
up
with
it
any
kind
of
work
indifferent
so
that
dear
love
go
with
it
i
do
not
blame
such
women
though
for
love
they
pick
much
oakum
earth
s
fanatics
make
too
frequently
heaven
s
saints
but
your
work
is
not
the
best
for
your
love
the
best
nor
able
to
commend
the
kind
of
work
for
love
s
sake
merely
ah
you
force
me
sir
to
be
in
speaking
of
myself
i
too
have
my
vocation
to
do
the
heavens
and
earth
have
set
me
since
i
changed
my
father
s
face
for
theirs
though
your
world
were
twice
as
wretched
as
you
represent
most
serious
work
most
necessary
work
as
any
of
the
economists
reform
make
trade
a
christian
possibility
and
individual
right
no
general
wrong
wipe
out
earth
s
furrows
of
the
thine
and
mine
and
leave
one
green
for
men
to
play
at
bowls
with
innings
for
them
all
what
then
indeed
if
mortals
were
not
greater
by
the
head
than
any
of
their
prosperities
what
then
unless
the
artist
keep
up
open
roads
betwixt
the
seen
and
unseen
through
the
best
of
your
conventions
with
his
best
the
speakable
imaginable
best
god
bids
him
speak
to
prove
what
lies
beyond
both
speech
and
imagination
a
starved
man
exceeds
a
fat
beast
we
ll
not
barter
sir
the
beautiful
for
even
so
i
hold
you
will
not
compass
your
poor
ends
of
and
material
ease
without
a
poet
s
individualism
to
work
your
universal
it
takes
a
soul
to
move
a
body
it
takes
a
man
to
move
the
masses
even
to
a
cleaner
stye
it
takes
the
ideal
to
blow
a
hair
off
the
dust
of
the
your
fouriers
failed
because
not
poets
enough
to
understand
that
life
develops
from
me
perhaps
i
am
not
worthy
as
you
say
of
work
like
this
perhaps
a
woman
s
soul
aspires
and
not
creates
yet
we
aspire
and
yet
i
ll
try
out
your
perhapses
sir
and
if
i
fail
why
burn
me
up
my
straw
like
other
false
ll
not
ask
for
grace
your
scorn
is
better
cousin
romney
i
who
love
my
art
would
never
wish
it
lower
to
suit
my
stature
i
may
love
my
art
you
ll
grant
that
even
a
woman
may
love
art
seeing
that
to
waste
true
love
on
anything
is
womanly
past
i
retain
the
very
last
word
which
i
said
that
day
as
you
the
creaking
of
the
door
years
past
which
let
upon
you
such
disabling
news
you
ever
after
have
been
graver
he
his
eyes
the
motions
in
his
silent
mouth
were
fiery
points
on
which
my
words
were
caught
transfixed
for
ever
in
my
memory
for
his
sake
not
their
own
and
yet
i
know
i
did
not
love
him
nor
he
me
that
s
sure
and
what
i
said
is
unrepented
of
as
truth
is
always
yet
a
princely
man
if
hard
to
me
heroic
for
himself
he
bears
down
on
me
through
the
slanting
years
the
stronger
for
the
distance
if
he
had
loved
ay
loved
me
with
that
retributive
face
i
might
have
been
a
common
woman
now
and
happier
less
known
and
less
left
alone
perhaps
a
better
woman
after
all
with
chubby
children
hanging
on
my
neck
to
keep
me
low
and
wise
ah
me
the
vines
that
bear
such
fruit
are
proud
to
stoop
with
it
the
palm
stands
upright
in
a
realm
of
sand
and
i
who
spoke
the
truth
then
stand
upright
still
worthy
of
having
spoken
out
the
truth
by
being
content
i
spoke
it
though
it
set
him
there
me
woman
s
vile
remorse
to
hanker
after
a
mere
name
a
show
a
supposition
a
potential
love
does
every
man
who
names
love
in
our
lives
become
a
power
for
that
is
love
s
true
thing
so
much
best
to
us
that
what
personates
love
is
next
best
a
potential
love
forsooth
we
are
not
so
vile
no
cleaves
i
think
this
man
this
image
chiefly
for
the
wrong
and
shock
he
gave
my
life
in
finding
me
precisely
where
the
devil
of
my
youth
had
set
me
on
those
of
hope
all
glittering
with
the
all
erect
and
famished
for
the
morning
while
i
looked
for
empire
and
much
tribute
come
i
have
some
worthy
work
for
thee
below
come
sweep
my
barns
and
keep
my
hospitals
and
i
will
pay
thee
with
a
current
coin
which
men
give
as
we
spoke
the
grass
was
trod
in
haste
beside
us
and
my
aunt
with
smile
distorted
by
the
sun
voice
as
much
at
issue
with
the
as
if
you
brought
a
candle
out
of
doors
broke
in
with
romney
here
child
entreat
your
cousin
to
the
house
and
have
your
talk
if
girls
must
talk
upon
their
birthdays
come
he
answered
for
me
calmly
with
pale
lips
that
seemed
to
motion
for
a
smile
in
vain
the
talk
is
ended
madam
where
we
stand
your
brother
s
daughter
has
dismissed
me
here
and
all
my
answer
can
be
better
said
beneath
the
trees
than
wrong
by
such
a
word
your
house
s
hospitalities
with
that
he
vanished
i
could
hear
his
heel
ring
bluntly
in
the
lane
as
down
he
leapt
the
short
way
from
a
measured
speech
withdrew
me
what
means
this
aurora
leigh
my
brother
s
daughter
has
dismissed
my
guests
the
lion
in
me
felt
the
keeper
s
voice
through
all
its
quivering
dewlaps
i
was
quelled
before
her
to
the
child
she
knew
i
prayed
her
pardon
said
i
had
little
thought
to
give
dismissal
to
a
guest
of
hers
in
letting
go
a
friend
of
mine
who
came
to
take
me
into
service
as
a
wife
no
more
than
that
no
more
no
more
pray
heaven
she
answered
that
i
was
not
mad
i
could
not
mean
to
tell
her
to
her
face
that
romney
leigh
had
asked
me
for
a
wife
and
i
refused
him
did
he
ask
i
said
i
think
he
rather
stooped
to
take
me
up
for
certain
uses
which
he
found
to
do
for
something
called
a
wife
he
never
what
stuff
she
answered
are
they
queens
these
girls
they
must
have
mantles
stitched
with
twenty
silks
spread
out
upon
the
ground
before
they
ll
step
one
footstep
for
the
noblest
lover
but
i
am
born
i
said
with
firmness
i
to
walk
another
way
than
his
dear
you
walk
you
walk
a
babe
at
thirteen
months
will
walk
as
well
as
you
she
cried
in
haste
without
a
steadying
finger
why
you
child
god
help
you
you
are
groping
in
the
dark
for
all
this
sunlight
you
suppose
perhaps
that
you
sole
offspring
of
an
opulent
man
are
rich
and
free
to
choose
a
way
to
walk
you
think
and
it
s
a
reasonable
thought
that
i
besides
being
well
to
do
in
life
will
leave
my
handful
in
my
niece
s
hand
when
death
shall
paralyse
these
fingers
pray
pray
child
i
know
you
love
me
not
as
if
you
loved
me
that
i
may
not
die
for
when
i
die
and
leave
you
out
you
go
unless
i
make
room
for
you
in
my
grave
unhoused
unfed
my
dear
poor
brother
s
lamb
ah
heaven
pains
a
right
to
crop
a
single
blade
of
grass
beneath
these
trees
or
cast
a
lamb
s
small
shadow
on
the
lawn
unfed
unfolded
ah
my
brother
here
s
the
fruit
you
planted
in
your
foreign
loves
ay
there
s
the
fruit
he
planted
never
look
astonished
at
me
with
your
mother
s
eyes
for
it
was
they
who
set
you
where
you
are
an
undowered
orphan
child
your
father
s
choice
of
that
said
mother
disinherited
his
daughter
his
and
hers
men
do
not
think
of
sons
and
daughters
when
they
fall
in
love
so
much
more
than
of
sisters
otherwise
he
would
have
paused
to
ponder
what
he
did
and
shrunk
before
that
clause
in
the
entail
excluding
offspring
by
a
foreign
wife
the
clause
set
up
a
hundred
years
ago
by
a
leigh
who
wedded
a
french
and
had
his
heart
danced
over
in
return
but
this
man
shrunk
at
nothing
never
thought
of
you
aurora
any
more
than
your
mother
must
have
been
a
pretty
thing
for
all
the
coarse
italian
blacks
and
browns
to
make
a
good
man
which
my
brother
was
unchary
of
the
duties
to
his
house
but
so
it
fell
indeed
our
cousin
vane
vane
leigh
the
father
of
this
romney
wrote
directly
on
your
birth
to
italy
i
ask
your
baby
daughter
for
my
son
in
whom
the
entail
now
merges
by
the
law
betroth
her
to
us
out
of
love
instead
of
colder
reasons
and
she
shall
not
lose
by
love
or
law
from
henceforth
he
wrote
a
generous
cousin
was
my
cousin
vane
remember
how
he
drew
you
to
his
knee
the
year
you
came
here
just
before
he
died
and
hollowed
out
his
hands
to
hold
your
cheeks
and
wished
them
redder
remember
vane
and
now
his
son
who
represents
our
house
and
holds
the
fiefs
and
manors
in
his
place
to
whom
reverts
my
pittance
when
i
die
except
a
few
books
and
a
pair
of
shawls
the
boy
is
generous
like
him
and
prepared
to
carry
out
his
kindest
word
and
thought
to
you
aurora
yes
a
fine
young
man
is
romney
leigh
although
the
sun
of
youth
has
shone
too
straight
upon
his
brain
i
know
and
fevered
him
with
dreams
of
doing
good
to
people
but
a
wife
will
put
all
right
and
stroke
his
temples
cool
with
healthy
touches
i
broke
in
at
that
i
could
not
lift
my
heavy
heart
to
breathe
till
then
but
then
i
raised
it
and
it
fell
in
broken
words
like
no
need
to
wait
the
dream
of
doing
good
to
me
at
least
is
ended
without
waiting
for
a
wife
to
cool
the
fever
for
him
we
ve
escaped
that
danger
thank
heaven
for
you
she
cried
have
got
a
fever
what
i
talk
and
talk
an
hour
long
to
you
instruct
you
how
you
can
not
eat
or
drink
or
stand
or
sit
or
even
die
like
any
decent
wretch
in
all
this
unroofed
and
unfurnished
world
without
your
cousin
you
still
maintain
there
s
room
twixt
him
and
you
for
flirting
fans
and
running
knots
in
eyebrows
you
must
have
a
pattern
lover
sighing
on
his
knee
you
do
not
count
enough
a
noble
heart
above
which
this
very
morn
unclosed
itself
in
two
dear
fathers
names
to
embrace
your
orphaned
life
fie
fie
but
stay
i
write
a
word
and
counteract
this
she
would
have
turned
to
leave
me
but
i
clung
o
sweet
my
father
s
sister
hear
my
word
before
you
write
yours
cousin
vane
did
well
and
cousin
romney
well
i
well
too
in
casting
back
with
all
my
strength
and
will
the
good
they
meant
me
o
my
god
my
god
god
meant
me
good
too
when
he
hindered
me
from
saying
yes
this
morning
if
you
write
a
word
it
shall
be
i
say
no
no
i
tie
up
no
upon
his
quite
out
of
reach
of
perjury
at
least
my
soul
is
not
a
pauper
i
can
live
at
least
my
soul
s
life
without
alms
from
men
and
if
it
must
be
in
heaven
instead
of
earth
let
heaven
look
to
it
am
not
afraid
she
seized
my
hands
with
both
hers
strained
them
fast
and
drew
her
probing
and
unscrupulous
eyes
right
through
me
body
and
heart
yet
foolish
sweet
you
love
this
man
i
have
watched
you
when
he
came
and
when
he
went
and
when
we
ve
talked
of
him
i
am
not
old
for
nothing
i
can
tell
the
of
love
this
girls
blush
sometimes
because
they
are
alive
half
wishing
they
were
dead
to
save
the
shame
the
sudden
blush
devours
them
neck
and
brow
they
have
drawn
too
near
the
fire
of
life
like
gnats
and
flare
up
bodily
wings
and
all
what
then
who
s
sorry
for
a
gnat
or
girl
i
blushed
i
feel
the
brand
upon
my
forehead
now
strike
hot
sear
deep
as
guiltless
men
may
feel
the
felon
s
iron
say
and
scorn
the
mark
of
what
they
are
not
most
illogical
irrational
nature
of
our
womanhood
that
blushes
one
way
feels
another
way
and
prays
perhaps
another
after
all
we
can
not
be
the
equal
of
the
male
who
rules
his
blood
a
little
for
although
i
blushed
indeed
as
if
i
loved
the
man
and
her
incisive
smile
accrediting
that
treason
of
false
witness
in
my
blush
did
bow
me
downward
like
a
swathe
of
grass
below
its
level
that
struck
me
attest
the
conscious
skies
and
all
their
daily
suns
i
think
i
loved
him
not
nor
then
nor
since
nor
ever
do
we
love
the
schoolmaster
being
busy
in
the
woods
much
less
being
poor
the
overseer
of
the
parish
do
we
keep
our
love
to
pay
our
debts
with
white
and
cold
i
grew
next
moment
as
my
blood
recoiled
from
that
imputed
ignominy
i
made
my
heart
great
with
it
then
at
last
i
spoke
spoke
veritable
words
but
passionate
too
passionate
perhaps
ground
up
with
sobs
to
shapeless
endings
she
let
fall
my
hands
and
took
her
smile
off
in
sedate
disgust
as
peradventure
she
had
touched
a
snake
a
dead
snake
mind
turning
round
replied
we
ll
leave
italian
manners
if
you
please
i
think
you
had
an
english
father
child
and
ought
to
find
it
possible
to
speak
a
quiet
yes
or
no
like
english
girls
without
convulsions
in
another
month
we
ll
take
another
answer
no
or
with
that
she
left
me
in
the
i
had
a
father
yes
but
long
how
long
it
seemed
that
moment
oh
how
far
how
far
and
safe
god
dost
thou
keep
thy
saints
when
once
gone
from
us
we
may
call
against
the
lighted
windows
of
thy
fair
where
all
the
souls
are
happy
not
one
not
even
my
father
look
from
work
or
play
to
ask
who
is
it
that
cries
after
us
below
there
in
the
dusk
yet
formerly
he
turned
his
face
upon
me
quick
enough
if
i
said
now
i
might
cry
loud
the
little
lark
reached
higher
with
his
song
than
i
with
crying
oh
alone
alone
not
troubling
any
in
heaven
nor
any
on
earth
i
stood
there
in
the
garden
and
looked
up
the
deaf
blue
sky
that
brings
the
roses
out
on
such
june
mornings
you
who
keep
account
of
crisis
and
transition
in
this
life
set
down
the
first
time
nature
says
plain
no
to
some
yes
in
you
and
walks
over
you
in
gorgeous
sweeps
of
scorn
we
all
begin
by
singing
with
the
birds
and
running
fast
with
hand
in
hand
but
once
for
all
the
birds
must
sing
against
us
and
the
sun
strike
down
upon
us
like
a
friend
s
sword
caught
by
an
enemy
to
slay
us
while
we
read
the
dear
name
on
the
blade
which
bites
at
us
that
s
bitter
and
convincing
after
that
we
seldom
doubt
that
something
in
the
large
smooth
order
of
creation
though
no
more
than
haply
a
man
s
footstep
has
gone
wrong
some
tears
fell
down
my
cheeks
and
then
i
smiled
as
those
smile
who
have
no
face
in
the
world
to
smile
back
to
them
i
had
lost
a
friend
in
romney
leigh
the
thing
was
friend
who
had
looked
at
me
most
gently
now
and
then
and
spoken
of
my
favourite
books
our
books
with
such
a
voice
well
voice
and
look
were
now
more
utterly
shut
out
from
me
i
felt
than
even
my
father
s
romney
now
was
turned
to
a
benefactor
to
a
generous
man
who
had
tied
himself
to
marry
me
instead
of
such
a
woman
with
low
timorous
lids
he
lifted
with
a
sudden
word
one
day
and
left
perhaps
for
my
by
a
contract
iphigenia
bound
at
a
fatal
aulis
for
the
winds
to
change
but
loose
ll
not
change
he
well
might
seem
a
little
cold
and
dominant
in
love
he
had
a
right
to
be
dogmatical
this
poor
good
romney
love
to
him
was
made
a
simple
if
i
married
him
i
would
not
dare
to
call
my
soul
my
own
which
so
he
had
bought
and
paid
for
every
thought
and
every
down
there
in
the
bill
not
one
found
honestly
deductible
from
any
use
that
pleased
him
he
might
cut
my
body
into
coins
to
give
away
among
his
other
paupers
change
my
sons
while
i
stood
dumb
as
griseld
for
black
babes
or
piteous
foundlings
might
unquestioned
set
my
right
hand
teaching
in
the
ragged
schools
my
left
hand
washing
in
the
public
baths
what
time
my
angel
of
the
ideal
stretched
both
his
to
me
in
vain
i
could
not
claim
the
poor
right
of
a
mouse
in
a
trap
to
squeal
and
take
so
much
as
pity
from
myself
farewell
good
romney
if
i
loved
you
even
i
could
but
ill
afford
to
let
you
be
so
generous
to
me
farewell
friend
since
friend
betwixt
us
two
forsooth
must
be
a
word
so
heavily
overladen
and
since
help
must
come
to
me
from
those
who
love
me
not
farewell
all
must
help
myself
and
am
alone
from
i
stooped
and
lifted
the
soiled
garland
from
the
ground
and
set
it
on
my
head
as
bitterly
as
when
the
spanish
king
did
crown
the
bones
of
his
dead
love
so
be
it
i
preserve
that
crown
still
the
drawer
there
twas
the
first
the
rest
are
like
it
olympian
crowns
we
run
for
till
we
lose
sight
of
the
sun
in
the
dust
of
the
racing
chariots
after
that
before
the
evening
fell
i
had
a
note
which
ran
aurora
sweet
chaldean
you
read
my
meaning
backward
like
your
eastern
books
while
i
am
from
the
west
dear
read
me
now
a
little
plainer
did
you
hate
me
quite
but
yesterday
i
loved
you
for
my
part
i
love
you
if
i
spoke
untenderly
this
morning
my
beloved
pardon
it
and
comprehend
me
that
i
loved
you
so
i
set
you
on
the
level
of
my
soul
and
overwashed
you
with
the
bitter
brine
of
some
habitual
thoughts
henceforth
my
flower
be
planted
out
of
reach
of
any
such
and
lean
the
side
you
please
with
all
your
leaves
write
woman
s
verses
and
dream
woman
s
dreams
but
let
me
feel
your
perfume
in
my
home
to
make
my
sabbath
after
bloom
out
your
youth
beside
me
my
i
wrote
in
we
chaldeans
discern
still
farther
than
we
read
i
know
your
heart
and
shut
it
like
the
holy
book
it
is
reserved
for
saints
to
pore
upon
betwixt
their
prayers
at
vespers
well
you
re
right
i
did
not
surely
hate
you
yesterday
and
yet
i
do
not
love
you
enough
to
wed
you
cousin
romney
take
this
word
and
let
it
stop
you
as
a
generous
man
from
speaking
farther
you
may
tease
indeed
and
blow
about
my
feelings
or
my
leaves
and
here
s
my
aunt
will
help
you
with
east
winds
and
break
a
stalk
perhaps
tormenting
me
but
certain
flowers
grow
near
as
deep
as
trees
and
cousin
you
ll
not
move
my
root
not
you
with
all
your
confluent
storms
then
let
me
grow
within
my
wayside
hedge
and
pass
your
way
this
flower
has
never
as
much
to
say
to
you
as
the
antique
tomb
which
said
to
travellers
pause
siste
ending
thus
i
signed
the
next
week
passed
in
silence
so
the
next
and
several
after
romney
did
not
come
nor
my
aunt
chide
me
i
lived
on
and
on
as
if
my
heart
were
kept
beneath
a
glass
and
everybody
stood
all
eyes
and
ears
to
see
and
hear
it
tick
i
could
not
sit
nor
walk
nor
take
a
book
nor
lay
it
down
not
sew
on
steadily
nor
drop
a
stitch
and
a
sigh
with
it
but
i
felt
her
looks
still
cleaving
to
me
like
the
sucking
asp
to
cleopatra
s
breast
persistently
through
the
intermittent
pantings
being
observed
when
observation
is
not
sympathy
is
just
being
tortured
if
she
said
a
word
a
thank
you
or
an
if
it
please
you
dear
she
meant
a
commination
or
at
best
an
exorcism
against
the
devildom
which
plainly
held
me
so
with
all
the
house
susannah
could
not
stand
and
twist
my
hair
without
such
glancing
at
the
to
see
my
face
there
that
she
missed
the
plait
and
john
never
sent
my
plate
for
soup
or
did
not
send
it
but
the
foolish
john
resolved
the
problem
twixt
his
napkined
thumbs
of
what
was
signified
by
taking
soup
or
choosing
mackerel
neighbours
who
dropped
in
on
morning
visits
feeling
a
joint
wrong
smiled
admonition
sate
uneasily
and
talked
with
measured
emphasised
reserve
of
parish
news
like
doctors
to
the
sick
when
not
called
in
if
with
leave
to
speak
they
might
say
something
nay
the
very
dog
would
watch
me
from
his
on
the
floor
in
alternation
with
the
large
black
fly
not
yet
in
reach
of
snapping
so
i
lived
a
roman
died
so
smeared
with
honey
teased
by
insects
stared
to
torture
by
the
noon
and
many
patient
souls
neath
english
roofs
have
died
like
romans
i
in
looking
back
wish
only
now
i
had
borne
the
plague
of
all
with
meeker
spirits
than
were
rife
in
rome
for
on
the
sixth
week
the
dead
sea
broke
up
dashed
suddenly
through
beneath
the
heel
of
him
who
stands
upon
the
sea
and
earth
and
swears
time
shall
be
nevermore
the
clock
struck
nine
that
morning
too
lark
was
out
of
tune
the
hidden
farms
among
the
hills
breathed
straight
their
smoke
toward
heaven
the
scarcely
stirred
beneath
the
blue
weight
of
the
cloudless
sky
though
still
the
july
air
came
floating
through
the
woodbine
at
my
window
in
and
out
with
touches
of
the
for
a
bending
forehead
there
i
sate
and
wished
that
of
god
would
last
till
eve
or
longer
sleep
i
thought
late
sleepers
and
spare
me
yet
the
burden
of
your
then
suddenly
a
single
ghastly
shriek
tore
upwards
from
the
bottom
of
the
house
like
one
who
wakens
in
a
grave
and
shrieks
the
still
house
seemed
to
shriek
itself
alive
and
shudder
through
its
passages
and
stairs
with
slam
of
doors
and
clash
of
sprang
i
stood
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
there
confronted
at
my
a
white
face
ineffectual
lips
come
come
they
tried
to
utter
and
i
went
as
if
a
ghost
had
drawn
me
at
the
point
of
a
fiery
finger
through
the
uneven
dark
i
went
with
reeling
footsteps
down
the
stair
nor
asked
a
question
there
she
sate
my
aunt
bolt
upright
in
the
chair
beside
her
bed
whose
pillow
had
no
dint
she
had
used
no
bed
for
that
night
s
sleeping
yet
slept
well
my
god
the
dumb
derision
of
that
grey
peaked
face
concluded
something
grave
against
the
sun
which
filled
the
chamber
with
its
july
burst
when
susan
drew
the
curtains
ignorant
of
who
sate
behind
her
there
she
sate
it
sate
we
said
she
yesterday
and
held
a
letter
with
unbroken
seal
as
susan
gave
it
to
her
hand
last
night
all
night
she
had
held
it
if
its
news
referred
to
duchies
or
to
dunghills
not
an
inch
she
d
budge
twas
obvious
for
such
worthless
odds
nor
though
the
stars
were
suns
and
overburned
their
spheric
limitations
swallowing
up
like
wax
the
azure
spaces
could
they
force
those
open
eyes
to
wink
once
what
last
sight
had
left
them
blank
and
flat
so
out
the
faculty
of
vision
from
the
roots
as
nothing
more
worth
seeing
remained
behind
were
those
the
eyes
that
watched
me
worried
me
that
dogged
me
up
and
down
the
hours
and
days
a
beaten
breathless
miserable
soul
and
did
i
pray
a
half
hour
back
but
so
to
escape
the
burden
of
those
eyes
those
eyes
sleep
late
i
why
now
indeed
they
sleep
god
answers
sharp
and
sudden
on
some
prayers
and
thrusts
the
thing
we
have
prayed
for
in
our
face
a
gauntlet
with
a
gift
in
t
every
wish
is
like
a
prayer
with
god
i
had
my
wish
to
read
and
meditate
the
thing
i
would
to
fashion
all
my
life
upon
my
thought
and
marry
or
not
marry
henceforth
none
could
disapprove
me
vex
me
hamper
me
full
in
this
desert
newly
made
for
babylon
or
balbec
the
breath
just
choked
with
sand
returns
for
building
towns
the
heir
came
over
on
the
funeral
day
and
we
two
cousins
met
before
the
dead
with
two
pale
faces
was
it
death
or
life
that
moved
us
when
the
will
was
read
and
done
the
official
guest
and
witnesses
withdrawn
we
rose
up
in
a
silence
almost
hard
and
looked
at
one
another
then
i
said
farewell
my
but
he
touched
just
touched
my
hatstrings
tied
for
going
at
the
door
the
carriage
stood
to
take
me
and
said
low
his
voice
a
little
unsteady
through
his
smile
siste
is
there
time
i
asked
in
these
last
days
of
railroads
to
stop
short
like
cæsar
s
chariot
weighing
half
a
ton
on
the
appian
road
for
morals
there
is
time
he
answered
grave
for
necessary
words
inclusive
trust
me
of
no
epitaph
on
man
or
act
my
cousin
we
have
read
a
will
which
gives
you
all
the
personal
goods
and
funded
monies
of
your
i
thank
her
memory
for
it
with
three
hundred
pounds
we
buy
in
england
even
clear
to
stand
and
work
in
only
two
hours
since
i
fancied
i
was
and
cousin
still
you
re
richer
than
you
fancy
the
will
says
hundred
pounds
and
any
other
sum
of
which
the
said
testatrix
dies
i
say
she
died
possessed
of
other
dear
romney
need
we
chronicle
the
pence
i
m
richer
than
i
s
evident
enough
listen
rather
you
ve
to
do
with
business
and
a
cousin
he
resumed
and
both
i
fear
need
patience
here
s
the
fact
the
other
sum
there
another
sum
unspecified
in
any
will
which
dates
after
possession
yet
bequeathed
as
much
and
clearly
as
those
said
three
hundred
pounds
is
thirty
thousand
you
will
have
it
paid
when
where
my
duty
troubles
you
with
he
struck
the
iron
when
the
bar
was
hot
no
wonder
if
my
eyes
sent
out
some
sparks
pause
there
i
thank
you
you
are
delicate
in
glosing
gifts
i
who
share
your
blood
am
rather
made
for
giving
like
yourself
than
taking
like
your
pensioners
he
stopped
me
with
a
gesture
of
calm
pride
a
leigh
he
said
gives
largesse
and
gives
love
but
gloses
neither
if
a
leigh
could
glose
he
would
not
do
it
moreover
to
a
leigh
with
blood
trained
up
along
nine
centuries
to
hound
and
hate
a
lie
from
eyes
like
yours
and
now
we
ll
make
the
rest
as
clear
your
aunt
possessed
these
you
will
make
it
clear
my
cousin
as
the
honour
of
us
both
or
one
of
us
speaks
s
not
i
my
aunt
possessed
this
sum
from
whom
and
when
bring
documents
prove
why
now
indeed
you
throw
your
bonnet
off
as
if
you
had
time
left
for
a
logarithm
the
faith
s
the
want
dear
cousin
give
me
faith
and
you
shall
walk
this
road
with
silken
shoes
as
clean
as
any
lady
of
our
house
supposed
the
proudest
oh
i
comprehend
the
whole
position
from
your
point
of
sight
i
oust
you
from
your
father
s
halls
and
lands
and
make
you
poor
by
getting
s
law
considering
which
in
common
circumstance
you
would
not
scruple
to
accept
from
me
some
compensation
some
sufficiency
of
were
justice
but
alas
i
love
you
that
s
mere
nature
reject
my
love
that
s
nature
also
at
once
you
can
not
from
a
suitor
disallowed
a
hand
thrown
back
as
mine
is
into
yours
receive
a
doit
a
farthing
not
for
the
world
that
s
etiquette
with
women
obviously
exceeding
claim
of
nature
law
and
right
unanswerable
to
all
i
grant
you
see
the
case
as
you
conceive
it
you
room
to
sweep
your
ample
skirts
of
womanhood
while
standing
humbly
squeezed
against
the
wall
i
own
myself
excluded
from
being
just
restrained
from
paying
indubitable
debts
because
denied
from
giving
you
my
that
s
my
misfortune
submit
to
it
as
if
in
some
more
reasonable
age
twould
not
be
less
inevitable
enough
you
ll
trust
me
cousin
as
a
gentleman
to
keep
your
honour
as
you
count
it
pure
your
scruples
just
as
if
i
thought
them
wise
safe
and
inviolate
from
gifts
of
i
answered
mild
but
earnest
i
believe
in
no
one
s
honour
which
another
keeps
nor
man
s
nor

s
as
i
keep
myself
my
truth
and
my
religion
i
depute
no

though
i
had
one

nor

though
i
had
twenty
much
less

though
twice
my
cousin
and
once

to
keep
my
honour
pure
you
face
a
man
who
wants
instruction
mark
me
not
a
woman
who
wants
protection
as
to
a
man
show
manhood
speak
out
plainly
be
precise
with
facts
and
dates
my
aunt
inherited
this
sum
you
i
said
she
died
possessed
of
this
dear
not
by
heritage
thank
you
we
re
getting
to
the
facts
at
last
perhaps
she
played
at
commerce
with
a
ship
which
came
in
heavy
with
australian
gold
or
touched
a
lottery
with
her
which
tumbled
on
a
sudden
into
her
lap
some
old
rhine
tower
or
principality
perhaps
she
had
to
do
with
a
marine
railroad
which
as
well
as
or
perhaps
some
stale
ancestral
debt
was
by
a
hundred
years
and
took
her
by
surprise
you
shake
your
head
my
cousin
i
guess
you
need
not
guess
aurora
nor
deride
the
truth
is
not
afraid
of
hurting
you
you
ll
find
no
cause
in
all
your
scruples
why
your
aunt
should
cavil
at
a
deed
of
gift
twixt
her
and
i
thought
a
you
naturally
thought
so
he
resumed
a
very
natural
a
gift
a
gift
her
individual
life
being
stranded
high
above
all
want
approaching
opulence
too
haughty
was
she
to
accept
a
gift
without
some
ultimate
aim
ah
ah
i
see
a
gift
intended
plainly
for
her
heirs
and
so
accepted
if
accepted
ah
indeed
that
might
be
i
am
snared
perhaps
just
so
but
cousin
shall
i
pardon
you
if
thus
you
have
caught
me
with
a
cruel
springe
he
answered
gently
need
you
tremble
and
pant
like
a
netted
lioness
is
t
my
fault
mine
that
you
re
a
grand
wild
creature
of
the
woods
and
hate
the
stall
built
for
you
any
way
though
triply
netted
need
you
glare
at
me
i
do
not
hold
the
cords
of
such
a
net
you
re
free
from
me
aurora
now
may
god
deliver
me
from
this
strait
this
gift
of
yours
was
tendered
when
accepted
when
i
asked
a
month
a
fortnight
since
six
weeks
ago
it
was
not
tendered
by
a
word
she
dropped
i
know
it
was
not
tendered
nor
received
when
was
it
bring
your
what
matters
when
a
ere
she
died
or
a
secured
the
gift
maintains
the
heritage
inviolable
with
law
as
easy
pluck
the
golden
stars
from
heaven
s
embroidered
stole
to
pin
them
on
the
grey
side
of
this
earth
as
make
you
poor
again
thank
not
poor
nor
clean
again
from
henceforth
you
thank
god
well
ask
you
i
insist
at
need
vouchsafe
the
special
date
the
special
the
day
before
her
he
replied
the
gift
was
in
her
hands
we
ll
find
that
deed
and
certify
that
date
to
as
one
who
has
climbed
a
and
carried
up
his
own
heart
climbing
panting
in
his
throat
with
the
toil
of
the
ascent
takes
breath
at
last
looks
back
in
i
stood
and
looked
dear
cousin
romney
we
have
reached
the
top
of
this
steep
question
and
may
rest
i
think
but
first
pray
you
pardon
that
the
shock
and
surge
of
natural
feeling
and
event
had
made
me
oblivious
of
acquainting
you
that
this
this
letter
unread
mark
sealed
was
found
enfolded
in
the
poor
dead
hand
that
spirit
of
hers
had
gone
beyond
the
address
which
could
not
find
her
though
you
wrote
it
clear
i
know
your
writing
romney
the
the
liberal
sweep
of
the
now
listen
us
understand
you
will
not
find
that
famous
deed
of
gift
unless
you
find
it
in
the
letter
here
which
not
being
mine
i
give
you
to
take
the
letter
well
and
i
as
writer
and
as
heiress
open
it
together
by
your
so
the
words
in
which
the
noble
offering
s
made
are
nobler
still
my
cousin
and
i
own
the
proudest
and
most
delicate
heart
alive
distracted
from
the
measure
of
the
gift
by
such
a
grace
in
giving
might
accept
your
largesse
without
thinking
any
more
of
the
burthen
of
it
than
king
solomon
considered
when
he
wore
his
holy
ring
charáctered
over
with
the
ineffable
spell
how
many
carats
of
fine
gold
made
up
its
so
leigh
gives
to
or
rather
might
have
given
observe
that
s
the
point
we
come
to
here
s
a
proof
of
gift
but
here
s
no
proof
sir
of
acceptancy
but
rather
disproof
death
s
black
dust
being
blown
infiltrated
through
every
secret
fold
of
this
sealed
letter
by
a
puff
of
fate
dried
up
for
ever
the
ink
annulled
the
gift
disutilised
the
grace
and
left
these
as
i
spoke
i
tore
the
paper
up
and
down
and
down
and
up
and
crosswise
till
it
fluttered
from
my
hands
as
stripped
suddenly
and
rapt
by
a
whirlwind
on
valdarno
drop
again
drop
slow
and
strew
the
melancholy
ground
before
the
amazèd
hills
why
so
indeed
i
m
writing
like
a
poet
somewhat
large
in
the
type
of
the
image
exaggerate
a
small
thing
with
a
great
thing
topping
it
but
then
i
m
thinking
how
his
eyes
looked
his
with
what
despondent
and
surprised
reproach
i
think
the
tears
were
in
them
as
he
i
think
the
manly
mouth
just
trembled
then
he
broke
the
silence
i
may
ask
perhaps
although
no
stranger
only
romney
leigh
which
means
still
less
than
vincent
carrington
your
plans
in
going
hence
and
where
you
go
this
can
not
be
a
all
my
life
is
open
to
you
cousin
i
go
hence
to
london
to
the
of
souls
to
live
mine
straight
out
vocally
in
books
harmoniously
for
others
if
indeed
a
woman
s
soul
like
man
s
be
wide
enough
to
carry
the
whole
octave
that
s
to
prove
or
if
i
fail
still
purely
for
myself
pray
god
be
with
me
ah
poor
child
who
fight
against
the
mother
s
tiring
hand
and
choose
the
headsman
s
may
god
change
his
world
for
your
sake
sweet
and
make
it
mild
as
heaven
and
juster
than
i
have
found
you
but
i
paused
and
you
my
cousin
i
he
said
you
ask
you
care
to
ask
well
girls
have
curious
minds
and
fain
would
know
the
end
of
everything
of
cousins
therefore
with
the
rest
for
me
aurora
i
ve
my
work
you
know
my
work
and
having
missed
this
year
some
personal
hope
i
must
beware
the
rather
that
i
miss
no
reasonable
duty
while
you
sing
your
happy
pastorals
of
the
meads
and
trees
bethink
you
that
i
go
to
impress
and
prove
on
stifled
brains
and
deafened
ears
stunned
deaf
crushed
dull
with
grief
that
nature
sings
itself
and
needs
no
mediate
poet
lute
or
voice
to
make
it
vocal
while
you
ask
of
men
your
audience
i
may
get
their
leave
perhaps
for
hungry
orphans
to
say
audibly
we
re
hungry
see
beaten
and
bullied
wives
to
hold
their
unweaned
babies
up
in
sight
whom
orphanage
would
better
and
for
all
to
speak
and
claim
their
portion
by
no
means
of
the
soil
but
of
the
sweat
in
tilling
it
since
this
is
turned
privilege
to
have
only
god
s
curse
on
us
and
not
man
s
such
work
i
have
for
doing
in
social
problems
you
tie
your
rhymes
to
draw
my
uses
to
cohere
with
needs
and
bring
the
uneven
world
back
to
its
round
or
failing
so
much
fill
up
bridge
at
least
to
smoother
issues
some
abysmal
cracks
and
feuds
of
earth
intestine
heats
have
made
to
keep
men
separate
sorry
shifts
of
hospitals
almshouses
infant
schools
and
other
practical
stuff
of
partial
good
you
lovers
of
the
beautiful
and
whole
despise
by
despise
the
scorn
is
yours
my
cousin
poets
become
such
through
scorning
nothing
you
decry
them
for
the
good
of
beauty
sung
and
taught
by
them
while
they
respect
your
practical
partial
good
as
being
a
part
of
beauty
s
self
adieu
when
god
helps
all
the
workers
for
his
world
the
singers
shall
have
help
of
him
not
he
smiled
as
men
smile
when
they
will
not
speak
because
of
something
bitter
in
the
thought
and
still
i
feel
his
melancholy
eyes
look
judgment
on
me
it
is
seven
years
since
i
know
not
if
twas
pity
or
twas
scorn
has
made
them
so
judge
it
ye
who
have
had
to
do
with
pity
more
than
love
and
scorn
than
hatred
i
am
used
since
then
to
other
ways
from
equal
men
but
so
even
so
we
let
go
hands
my
cousin
and
i
and
in
between
us
rushed
the
to
blanch
our
faces
like
divided
rocks
and
bar
for

lost
it
because
no

that
s
really
loss
and
passable
impudence
my
critic
hammond
flatters
prettily
and
wants
another
volume
like
the
last
my
critic
belfair
wants
another
book
entirely
different
which
will
sell
and
live
a
striking
book
yet
not
a
startling
book

public
blames
originalities
you
must
not
pump
unawares
upon
a
gracious
public
full
of
good
things
not
subtle
new
yet
orthodox
as
easy
reading
as
the
page
that
s
fingered
by
said
public
fifty
years
since
first
taught
spelling
by
its
grandmother
and
yet
a
revelation
in
some

my

says
he
and
do
not
prate
so
of

whereat
i
call
my
critic
simply
stokes
my
critic
jobson
recommends
more
mirth
because
a
cheerful
genius
suits
the
times
and
all
true
poets
laugh
unquenchably
like
shakspeare
and
the
gods
that
s
very
hard
the

may
laugh
and
shakspeare

smiled
with
such
a
needy

on

we
cry

who
dares
exclaim
at

ha
from
vincent
carrington
dear
friend
i
want
good
counsel
will
you
lend
me
wings
to
raise
me
to
the
subject
in
a
sketch
i
ll
bring
i
at
eleven
a
poet
s
only
born
to
turn
to
use
so
save
you
for
the
world
and
writ
after
have
you
heard
of
romney
leigh
beyond
what
s
said
of
him
in
newspapers
his
phalansteries
there
his
speeches
here
his
pamphlets
pleas
and
statements
everywhere
he
dropped
long
ago
but
no
one
drops
a
golden
indeed
one
day
you
hinted
that
but
jested
well
at
least
you
know
lord
howe
who
sees
him
whom
he
sees
and
see
and
i
hate
to
see
howe
stands
high
upon
the
brink
of
theories
observes
the
swimmers
and
cries
very
fine
but
keeps
dry
linen
equally
that
gallant
breaster
romney
strange
it
is
such
sudden
madness
seizing
a
young
man
to
make
earth
over
again
i
m
content
to
make
the
pictures
let
me
bring
the
sketch
a
tiptoe
danae
overbold
and
hot
both
arms
to
meet
her
wishing
jove
halfway
and
burn
him
faster
down
the
face
and
breasts
upturned
and
straining
the
loose
locks
all
glowing
with
the
anticipated
gold
or
here
s
another
on
the
theme
she
lies
upon
her
the
long
hair
swathed
about
her
to
the
heel
like
wet
you
dimly
see
her
through
the
glittering
haze
of
that
prodigious
rain
half
blotted
out
of
nature
by
a
love
as
heavy
as
fate
i
ll
bring
you
either
sketch
i
think
myself
the
second
indicates
more
surely
self
is
put
away
and
calm
with
abdication
she
is
jove
and
no
more
thus
perhaps
the
painter
symbolises
unawares
two
states
of
the
recipient
one
forward
personal
wanting
reverence
because
aspiring
only
we
ll
be
calm
and
know
that
when
indeed
our
joves
come
down
we
all
turn
stiller
than
we
have
ever
been
kind
vincent
carrington
i
ll
let
him
come
he
talks
of
florence
may
say
a
word
of
something
as
it
chanced
seven
years
ago
a
hedgehog
in
the
path
or
a
lame
bird
in
those
green
country
walks
in
that
good
time
when
certainly
i
was
so
miserable
i
seem
to
have
missed
a
blessing
ever
since
the
music
soars
within
the
little
lark
and
the
lark
soars
it
is
not
thus
with
men
we
do
not
make
our
places
with
our
strains
content
while
they
rise
to
remain
behind
alone
on
earth
instead
of
so
in
heaven
no
bear
on
my
broken
tale
when
romney
leigh
and
i
had
parted
thus
i
took
a
chamber
up
three
flights
of
stairs
not
far
from
being
as
steep
as
some
larks
climb
and
in
a
certain
house
in
kensington
three
years
i
lived
and
worked
get
leave
to
work
in
this
world
tis
the
best
you
get
at
all
for
god
in
cursing
gives
us
better
gifts
than
men
in
benediction
god
says
sweat
for
foreheads
men
say
crowns
and
so
we
are
crowned
ay
gashed
by
some
tormenting
circle
of
steel
which
snaps
with
a
secret
spring
get
work
get
work
be
sure
tis
better
than
what
you
work
to
get
so
happy
and
unafraid
of
solitude
i
worked
the
short
days
out
watched
the
sun
on
lurid
morns
or
monstrous
afternoons
like
some
druidic
idol
s
fiery
brass
with
fixed
unflickering
outline
of
dead
heat
in
which
the
blood
of
wretches
pent
inside
seemed
oozing
forth
to
incarnadine
the
air
push
out
through
fog
with
his
dilated
disk
and
startle
the
slant
roofs
and
with
splashes
of
fierce
colour
or
i
saw
fog
only
the
great
tawny
weltering
fog
involve
the
passive
city
strangle
it
alive
and
draw
it
off
into
the
void
spires
bridges
streets
and
squares
as
if
a
spunge
had
wiped
out
london
as
noon
and
night
had
clapped
together
and
utterly
struck
out
the
intermediate
time
undoing
themselves
in
the
act
your
city
poets
see
such
things
not
despicable
mountains
of
the
south
when
drunk
and
mad
with
elemental
wines
they
rend
the
seamless
mist
and
stand
up
bare
make
fewer
singers
haply
no
one
sings
descending
sinai
on
parnassus
mount
you
take
a
mule
to
climb
and
not
a
muse
except
in
fable
and
figure
forests
chant
their
anthems
to
themselves
and
leave
you
dumb
but
sit
in
london
at
the
day
s
decline
and
view
the
city
perish
in
the
mist
like
pharaoh
s
armaments
in
the
deep
red
sea
the
chariots
horsemen
footmen
all
the
host
sucked
down
and
choked
to
surprised
by
a
sudden
sense
of
vision
and
of
tune
you
feel
as
conquerors
though
you
did
not
fight
and
you
and
israel
s
other
singing
girls
ay
miriam
with
them
sing
the
song
you
choose
i
worked
with
patience
which
means
almost
power
i
did
some
excellent
things
indifferently
some
bad
things
excellently
both
were
praised
the
latter
loudest
and
by
such
a
time
that
i
myself
had
set
them
down
as
sins
scarce
worth
the
price
of
sackcloth
week
by
week
arrived
some
letter
through
the
sedulous
post
like
these
i
ve
read
and
yet
dissimilar
with
pretty
maiden
seals
twined
of
lilies
or
a
heart
marked
convicting
emily
of
being
all
heart
or
rarer
tokens
from
young
bachelors
who
wrote
from
college
with
the
same
goosequill
suppose
they
had
just
been
plucked
of
and
a
snatch
from
horace
collegisse
juvat
set
upon
the
first
page
many
a
letter
signed
or
unsigned
showing
the
writers
at
eighteen
had
lived
too
long
though
every
muse
should
help
the
daylight
holding
candles
to
smile
or
sigh
at
such
could
pass
with
me
no
more
than
coins
from
moscow
circulate
at
paris
would
ten
roubles
buy
a
tag
of
ribbon
on
the
boulevard
worth
a
sou
i
smiled
that
all
this
youth
should
love
me
that
such
a
love
could
scarcely
raise
them
up
to
love
what
was
more
worthy
than
myself
then
sighed
again
again
less
generously
to
think
the
very
love
they
lavished
so
proved
me
inferior
the
strong
loved
me
not
and
he
my
cousin
romney
did
not
write
i
felt
the
silent
finger
of
his
scorn
prick
every
bubble
of
my
frivolous
fame
as
my
breath
blew
it
and
resolve
it
back
to
the
air
it
came
from
oh
i
justified
the
measure
he
had
taken
of
my
height
the
thing
was
was
not
wrong
a
line
i
played
at
art
made
thrusts
with
a
amused
the
lads
and
maidens
came
a
sigh
deep
hoarse
with
resolution
would
work
to
better
ends
or
play
in
earnest
heavens
i
think
i
should
be
almost
popular
if
this
went
on
ripped
my
verses
up
and
found
no
blood
upon
the
rapier
s
point
the
heart
in
them
was
just
an
embryo
s
heart
which
never
yet
had
beat
that
it
should
die
just
gasps
of
galvanic
life
mere
tones
inorganised
to
any
tune
and
yet
i
felt
it
in
me
where
it
burnt
like
those
hot
of
creation
held
in
jove
s
clenched
palm
before
the
worlds
were
sown
but
was
not
juno
even
my
hand
was
shut
in
weak
convulsion
woman
s
ill
and
when
i
yearned
to
loose
a
the
nerve
revolted
tis
the
same
even
now
this
hand
may
never
haply
open
large
before
the
spark
is
quenched
or
the
palm
charred
to
prove
the
power
not
else
than
by
the
pain
it
burns
it
whole
life
burnt
with
it
and
light
not
sunlight
and
not
torchlight
flashed
my
steps
out
through
the
slow
and
difficult
road
i
had
grown
distrustful
of
too
forward
springs
the
season
s
books
in
drear
significance
of
morals
dropping
round
me
lively
books
the
ash
has
livelier
verdure
than
the
yew
and
yet
the
yew
s
green
longer
and
alone
found
worthy
of
the
holy
christmas
time
we
ll
plant
more
yews
if
possible
albeit
we
plant
the
graveyards
with
them
day
and
night
i
worked
my
rhythmic
thought
and
furrowed
up
both
watch
and
slumber
with
long
lines
of
life
which
did
not
suit
their
season
the
rose
fell
from
either
cheek
my
eyes
globed
luminous
through
orbits
of
blue
shadow
and
my
pulse
would
shudder
along
the
wrist
like
a
shot
bird
youth
s
stern
set
face
to
face
with
youth
s
ideal
and
when
people
came
and
said
you
work
too
much
you
are
looking
ill
i
smiled
for
pity
of
them
who
pitied
me
and
thought
i
should
be
better
soon
perhaps
for
those
ill
looks
i
means
in
youth
just
the
conscious
and
eternal
soul
with
all
its
ends
not
the
outside
life
the
the
doublet
of
the
flesh
the
so
much
liver
lung
integument
which
make
the
sum
of
i
hereafter
when
talk
of
doing
well
or
prosper
if
i
gain
a
step
although
a
nail
then
pierced
my
foot
although
my
brain
embracing
any
truth
froze
paralysed
prosper
i
but
change
my
instrument
i
break
the
spade
off
digging
deep
for
gold
and
catch
the
mattock
up
i
worked
on
on
through
all
the
bristling
fence
of
nights
and
days
which
hedges
time
in
from
the
eternities
i
struggled
never
stopped
to
note
the
stakes
which
hurt
me
in
my
course
the
midnight
oil
would
stink
sometimes
there
came
some
vulgar
needs
i
had
to
live
that
therefore
i
might
work
and
being
but
poor
i
was
constrained
for
life
to
work
with
one
hand
for
the
booksellers
while
working
with
the
other
for
myself
and
art
you
swim
with
feet
as
well
as
hands
or
make
small
way
i
apprehended
this
in
england
no
one
lives
by
verse
that
lives
and
apprehending
i
resolved
by
prose
to
make
a
space
to
sphere
my
living
verse
i
wrote
for
cyclopædias
magazines
and
weekly
papers
holding
up
my
name
to
keep
it
from
the
mud
i
learnt
the
use
of
the
editorial
we
in
a
review
as
courtly
ladies
the
fine
trick
of
trains
and
swept
it
grandly
through
the
open
doors
as
if
one
could
not
pass
through
doors
at
all
save
so
encumbered
i
wrote
tales
beside
carved
many
an
article
on
to
suit
light
readers
in
the
lines
revealing
it
was
said
the
but
that
i
ll
never
vouch
for
what
you
do
for
bread
will
taste
of
common
grain
not
grapes
although
you
have
a
vineyard
in
champagne
much
less
in
nephelococcygia
as
mine
was
peradventure
having
bread
for
just
so
many
days
just
breathing
room
for
body
and
verse
i
stood
up
straight
and
worked
my
veritable
work
and
as
the
soul
which
grows
within
a
child
makes
the
child
grow
or
as
the
fiery
sap
the
touch
from
god
careering
through
a
tree
dilates
the
bark
and
roughs
with
scale
and
knob
before
it
strikes
the
summer
foliage
out
in
a
green
so
life
in
deepening
with
me
deepened
all
the
course
i
took
the
work
i
did
indeed
the
academic
law
convinced
of
sin
the
critics
cried
out
on
the
falling
off
regretting
the
first
manner
but
i
felt
my
heart
s
life
throbbing
in
my
verse
to
show
it
lived
it
incomplete
disordered
with
all
adam
in
the
blood
but
even
its
very
tumours
warts
and
wens
still
organised
by
and
implying
life
a
lady
called
upon
me
on
such
a
day
she
had
the
low
voice
of
your
english
dames
unused
it
seems
to
need
rise
half
a
note
to
catch
attention
their
quiet
mood
as
if
they
lived
too
high
above
the
earth
for
that
to
put
them
out
in
anything
so
gentle
because
verily
so
proud
so
wary
and
afeared
of
hurting
you
by
no
means
that
you
are
not
really
vile
but
that
they
would
not
touch
you
with
their
foot
to
push
you
to
your
place
so
yet
gracious
and
conciliating
it
takes
an
effort
in
their
presence
to
speak
truth
you
know
the
sort
of
woman
stuff
and
out
of
nature
lady
waldemar
she
said
her
name
quite
simply
as
if
it
meant
not
much
indeed
but
something
my
hands
and
smiled
as
if
her
smile
could
help
my
case
and
dropped
her
eyes
on
me
and
let
them
melt
is
this
she
said
the
muse
no
sybil
even
i
answered
since
she
fails
to
guess
the
cause
which
taxed
you
with
this
visit
good
she
said
i
like
to
be
sincere
at
once
perhaps
if
i
had
found
a
literal
muse
the
visit
might
have
taxed
me
as
it
is
you
wear
your
blue
so
chiefly
in
your
eyes
my
fair
aurora
in
a
frank
good
way
it
comforts
me
entirely
for
your
fame
as
well
as
for
the
trouble
of
my
ascent
to
this
there
a
silver
laugh
ran
rippling
through
her
quickened
little
breaths
the
steep
stair
somewhat
justified
but
still
your
ladyship
has
left
me
curious
why
you
dared
the
risk
of
finding
the
said
muse
ah
me
notwithstanding
to
the
point
like
any
pedant
is
the
blue
in
eyes
as
awful
as
in
stockings
after
all
i
wonder
that
you
d
have
my
business
out
before
i
the
epic
plunge
in
spite
of
gasps
well
naturally
you
think
i
ve
come
here
as
the
go
to
deserts
to
secure
you
with
a
trap
for
exhibition
in
my
on
zoologic
soirées
not
in
the
least
roar
softly
at
me
i
am
frivolous
i
dare
say
i
have
played
at
lions
too
like
other
women
of
my
class
now
i
meet
my
lion
simply
as
androcles
met
his
when
at
his
so
she
bent
her
head
as
queens
may
mock
lifting
up
her
eyelids
with
a
real
grave
queenly
look
which
ruled
and
would
not
spare
not
even
herself
i
think
you
have
a
cousin
you
bring
a
word
from
eyes
leapt
up
to
the
very
height
of
hers
a
word
from
i
bring
a
word
about
him
actually
but
first
pressed
me
with
her
urgent
you
do
not
love
him
you
re
frank
at
least
in
putting
questions
madam
i
replied
i
love
my
cousin
i
guessed
as
much
i
m
ready
to
be
frank
in
answering
also
if
you
ll
question
me
or
even
with
something
less
you
stand
outside
you
artist
women
of
the
common
sex
you
share
not
with
us
and
exceed
us
so
perhaps
by
what
you
re
mulcted
in
your
hearts
being
starved
to
make
your
heads
so
run
the
old
traditions
of
you
i
can
therefore
speak
without
the
natural
shame
which
creatures
feel
when
speaking
on
their
level
to
their
like
there
s
many
a
papist
she
would
rather
die
than
own
to
her
maid
she
put
a
ribbon
on
to
catch
the
indifferent
eye
of
such
a
man
who
yet
would
count
adulteries
on
her
beads
at
holy
mary
s
shrine
and
never
blush
because
the
saints
are
so
far
off
we
lose
all
modesty
before
them
thus
today
tis
love
romney
forbear
i
cried
if
here
s
no
muse
still
less
is
any
saint
nor
even
a
friend
that
lady
waldemar
should
make
confessions
that
s
unkindly
said
if
no
friend
what
forbids
to
make
a
friend
to
join
to
our
confession
ere
we
have
done
i
love
your
cousin
if
it
seems
unwise
to
say
so
it
s
still
foolisher
we
re
frank
to
feel
so
my
first
husband
left
me
young
and
pretty
enough
so
please
you
and
rich
enough
to
keep
my
booth
in
with
the
rest
to
happy
issues
there
are
marquises
would
serve
seven
years
to
call
me
wife
i
know
and
after
seven
i
might
consider
it
for
there
s
some
comfort
in
a
marquisate
when
all
s
said
but
after
the
seven
years
i
now
love
romney
you
put
up
your
lip
so
like
a
leigh
so
like
him
me
i
am
well
aware
i
do
not
derogate
in
loving
romney
leigh
the
name
is
good
the
means
are
excellent
but
the
man
the
heaven
help
us
both
am
near
as
mad
as
he
in
loving
such
an
she
slowly
swung
her
heavy
ringlets
till
they
touched
her
smile
as
reasonably
sorry
for
herself
and
thus
continued
of
a
truth
miss
leigh
i
have
not
without
struggle
come
to
this
i
took
a
master
in
the
german
tongue
i
gamed
a
little
went
to
paris
twice
but
after
all
this
love
you
eat
of
love
and
do
as
vile
a
thing
as
if
you
ate
of
whatever
else
you
eat
tastes
uniformly
acrid
till
your
peach
reminds
you
of
your
onion
am
i
coarse
well
love
s
coarse
nature
s
there
s
the
rub
we
fair
fine
ladies
who
park
out
our
lives
from
common
can
not
help
the
crows
from
flying
over
re
as
natural
still
as
blowsalinda
drape
us
perfectly
in
lyons
velvet
are
not
for
that
look
you
we
have
hearts
within
warm
live
improvident
indecent
hearts
as
ready
for
distracted
ends
and
acts
as
any
distressed
sempstress
of
them
all
that
romney
groans
and
toils
for
we
catch
love
and
other
fevers
in
the
vulgar
way
love
will
not
be
outwitted
by
our
wit
nor
outrun
by
our
equipages
persisted
spite
of
efforts
all
my
cards
turned
up
but
romney
leigh
my
german
stopped
at
germane
wertherism
my
paris
rounds
returned
me
from
the
champs
elysées
just
a
ghost
and
sighing
like
dido
s
i
came
home
uncured
rather
to
myself
of
being
in
love
in
love
that
s
coarse
you
ll
say
i
m
talking
coldly
i
replied
apologise
for
atheism
not
love
for
me
i
do
believe
in
love
and
god
i
know
my
cousin
lady
waldemar
i
know
not
yet
i
say
as
much
as
whoever
loves
him
let
her
not
excuse
but
cleanse
herself
that
loving
such
a
man
she
may
not
do
it
with
such
unworthy
love
he
can
not
stoop
and
take
that
is
said
austerely
like
a
youthful
prophetess
who
knits
her
brows
across
her
pretty
eyes
to
keep
them
back
from
following
the
grey
flight
of
doves
between
the
dear
be
kinder
with
me
let
us
two
be
friends
i
m
a
mere
woman
more
weak
perhaps
through
being
so
proud
you
re
better
as
for
him
he
s
best
indeed
he
builds
his
goodness
up
so
high
it
topples
down
to
the
other
side
and
makes
a
sort
of
badness
there
s
the
worst
i
have
to
say
against
your
cousin
s
best
and
so
be
mild
aurora
with
my
worst
for
his
sake
if
not
i
own
myself
incredulous
of
confidence
like
this
availing
him
or
i
worthy
of
him
in
your
sense
i
am
not
it
pass
and
yet
i
save
him
if
i
marry
him
let
that
pass
pass
pass
we
play
police
upon
my
cousin
s
life
to
indicate
what
may
or
may
not
pass
i
cried
he
knows
what
s
worthy
of
him
the
choice
remains
with
and
what
he
chooses
act
or
wife
i
think
i
shall
not
call
unworthy
i
for
tis
somewhat
rashly
said
she
answered
slow
now
let
s
talk
reason
though
we
talk
of
love
your
cousin
romney
leigh
s
a
monster
there
the
word
s
out
fairly
let
me
prove
the
fact
we
ll
take
say
that
most
perfect
of
antiques
they
call
the
genius
of
the
vatican
which
seems
too
beauteous
to
endure
itself
in
this
mixed
world
and
fasten
it
for
once
upon
the
torso
of
the
drunken
fawn
who
might
limp
surely
if
he
did
not
dance
instead
of
buonarroti
s
mask
what
then
we
show
the
sort
of
monster
romney
is
with
virtues
and
heroic
aims
subjoined
to
limping
possibilities
of
mismade
human
nature
grant
the
man
twice
twice
heroic
he
limps
and
here
s
the
point
we
come
pardon
me
but
lady
waldemar
the
point
s
the
thing
we
never
come
caustic
insolent
at
need
i
like
you
there
she
took
my
hands
and
now
my
lioness
help
androcles
for
all
your
roaring
help
me
for
myself
i
would
not
say
for
him
he
limps
so
certainly
he
ll
fall
into
the
pit
a
week
hence
i
lose
he
is
lost
and
when
he
s
fairly
married
he
a
leigh
to
a
girl
of
doubtful
life
undoubtful
birth
starved
out
in
london
till
her
hands
are
whiter
than
her
morals
for
one
may
call
his
choice
most
married
lost
he
romney
ah
you
re
moved
at
last
she
said
these
monsters
set
out
in
the
open
sun
of
course
throw
monstrous
shadows
those
who
think
awry
will
scarce
act
straightly
who
but
he
and
who
but
you
can
wonder
he
has
been
mad
the
whole
world
knows
since
first
a
nominal
man
he
soured
the
proctors
tried
the
gownsmen
s
wits
with
equal
scorn
of
triangles
and
wine
and
took
no
honours
yet
was
honourable
they
ll
tell
you
he
lost
count
of
homer
s
ships
in
melbourne
s
ashley
s
factory
bills
ignored
the
aspasia
we
all
dare
to
praise
for
other
women
dear
we
could
not
name
because
we
re
decent
well
he
had
some
right
on
his
side
probably
men
always
have
who
go
absurdly
wrong
the
living
boor
who
brews
your
ale
exceeds
in
vital
worth
dead
cæsar
who
stops
bungholes
in
the
cask
and
also
to
do
good
is
excellent
for
persons
of
his
income
even
to
boors
i
sympathise
with
all
such
things
but
he
went
mad
upon
them
madder
and
more
mad
from
college
times
to
these
going
down
hill
the
faster
still
the
farther
you
must
know
your
leigh
by
heart
he
has
sown
his
black
young
curls
with
bleaching
cares
of
half
a
million
men
already
if
you
do
not
starve
or
sin
you
re
nothing
to
him
pay
the
and
break
your
heart
upon
t
he
ll
scarce
be
touched
but
come
upon
the
parish
qualified
for
the
parish
stocks
and
romney
will
be
there
to
call
you
brother
sister
or
perhaps
a
tenderer
name
still
had
i
any
chance
with
mister
leigh
who
am
lady
waldemar
and
never
committed
felony
you
speak
too
bitterly
i
said
for
the
literal
the
truth
is
bitter
here
s
a
man
who
looks
for
ever
on
the
ground
you
must
be
low
or
else
a
pictured
ceiling
overhead
good
painting
thrown
away
for
me
i
ve
done
what
women
may
we
re
somewhat
limited
we
modest
women
but
i
ve
done
my
best
men
are
perjured
when
they
swear
our
eyes
have
meaning
in
them
they
re
just
blue
or
brown
they
just
can
drop
their
lids
a
little
in
fact
mine
did
more
for
i
read
half
fourier
through
proudhon
considerant
and
louis
blanc
with
various
others
of
his
socialists
and
if
i
had
been
a
fathom
less
in
love
had
cured
myself
with
gaping
as
it
was
i
quoted
from
them
prettily
enough
perhaps
to
make
them
sound
half
rational
to
a
saner
man
than
he
whene
er
we
talked
for
which
i
dodged
occasion
by
heart
his
speeches
in
the
commons
and
elsewhere
upon
the
social
question
heaped
reports
of
wicked
women
and
penitentiaries
on
all
my
tables
with
a
place
for
sue
and
gave
my
name
to
swell
toward
keeping
up
the
sun
at
nights
in
heaven
and
other
possible
ends
all
things
i
did
except
the
impossible
such
as
wearing
gowns
provided
by
the
ten
hours
movement
there
i
must
stop
somewhere
he
meanwhile
unmoved
as
the
indian
tortoise
neath
the
world
let
all
that
noise
go
on
upon
his
back
he
would
not
disconcert
or
throw
me
out
twas
well
to
see
a
woman
of
my
class
with
such
a
dawn
of
conscience
for
the
heart
made
firewood
for
his
sake
and
flaming
up
to
his
very
face
he
warmed
his
feet
at
it
but
deigned
to
let
my
carriage
stop
him
short
in
park
or
street
leaning
on
the
door
with
news
of
the
committee
which
sate
last
on
pickpockets
at
you
as
martyrs
jest
dear
if
you
ve
read
their
lives
upon
the
axe
which
kills
them
when
all
s
done
by
me
for
ll
ask
him
presently
the
colour
of
my
can
not
tell
or
answers
dark
at
random
be
sure
he
s
absolute
on
the
figure
five
or
ten
of
my
last
subscription
is
it
bearable
and
i
a
woman
is
it
reparable
though
were
a
man
i
know
not
that
s
to
prove
but
first
this
shameful
ay
i
cried
then
really
there
s
a
marriage
yesterday
i
held
him
fast
upon
it
mister
leigh
said
i
shut
up
a
thing
it
makes
more
noise
the
boiling
town
keeps
secrets
ill
i
ve
known
yours
since
last
week
forgive
my
knowledge
so
you
feel
i
m
not
the
woman
of
the
world
the
world
thinks
you
have
borne
with
me
before
and
used
me
in
your
noble
work
our
work
and
now
you
shall
not
cast
me
off
because
you
re
at
the
difficult
point
the
tis
true
even
i
can
scarce
admit
the
cogency
of
such
a
marriage
where
you
do
not
love
except
the
class
yet
marry
and
throw
your
name
down
to
the
gutter
for
a
to
future
generations
it
s
sublime
a
great
example
true
genesis
of
the
opening
social
era
but
take
heed
this
virtuous
act
must
have
a
patent
weight
or
loses
half
its
virtue
make
it
tell
interpret
it
and
set
in
the
light
and
do
not
muffle
it
in
a
as
a
vulgar
bit
of
shame
if
at
best
a
leigh
had
made
a
misalliance
and
blushed
a
howard
should
know
then
i
pressed
him
he
would
not
choose
i
said
that
even
his
kin
aurora
leigh
even
should
conceive
his
act
less
sacrifice
more
at
which
he
grew
so
pale
dear
to
the
lips
i
knew
i
had
touched
him
do
you
know
her
he
enquired
my
cousin
aurora
yes
i
said
and
lied
but
truly
we
all
know
you
by
your
books
and
so
i
offered
to
come
straight
to
you
explain
the
subject
justify
the
cause
and
take
you
with
me
to
margaret
s
court
to
see
this
miracle
this
marian
erle
this
drover
s
daughter
she
s
not
pretty
he
swears
upon
whose
finger
exquisitely
pricked
by
a
hundred
needles
we
re
to
hang
the
tie
twixt
class
and
class
in
england
indeed
by
such
a
presence
yours
and
mine
to
lift
the
match
up
from
the
doubtful
place
at
once
he
thanked
me
sighing
murmured
to
himself
she
ll
do
it
perhaps
she
s
noble
me
twice
and
promised
as
my
guerdon
to
put
off
his
marriage
for
a
i
answered
then
i
understand
your
drift
imperfectly
you
wish
to
lead
me
to
my
cousin
s
betrothed
to
touch
her
hand
if
worthy
and
hold
her
hand
if
feeble
thus
to
justify
his
match
so
be
it
then
but
how
this
serves
your
ends
and
how
the
strange
confession
of
your
love
serves
this
i
have
to
can
not
she
knit
her
restless
forehead
then
despite
aurora
that
most
radiant
morning
name
you
re
dull
as
any
london
afternoon
i
wanted
time
gained
it
and
gain
you
you
will
come
and
see
the
girl
in
whose
most
prodigal
eyes
the
lineal
pearl
and
pride
of
all
your
lofty
race
of
leighs
is
destined
to
solution
authorised
by
sight
and
knowledge
then
you
ll
speak
your
mind
and
prove
to
romney
in
your
brilliant
way
he
ll
wrong
the
people
and
posterity
say
such
a
thing
is
bad
for
you
and
me
and
you
fail
utterly
by
concluding
thus
an
execrable
marriage
break
it
up
disroot
presently
we
ll
plant
a
better
fortune
in
its
place
be
good
to
me
aurora
scorn
me
less
for
saying
the
thing
i
should
not
well
i
know
i
should
not
i
have
kept
as
others
have
the
iron
rule
of
womanly
reserve
in
lip
and
life
till
now
i
wept
a
week
before
i
came
she
was
pale
the
last
words
haughtily
said
were
tremulous
this
palfrey
pranced
in
harness
arched
her
neck
and
only
by
the
foam
upon
the
bit
you
saw
she
champed
against
it
then
i
rose
i
love
love
truth
s
no
cleaner
thing
than
love
i
comprehend
a
love
so
fiery
hot
it
burns
its
natural
veil
of
august
shame
and
stands
sublimely
in
the
nude
as
chaste
as
medicean
venus
but
i
know
a
love
that
burns
through
veils
will
burn
through
masks
and
shrivel
up
treachery
what
love
and
lie
to
the
opera
your
love
s
i
love
and
lie
she
i
lie
forsooth
and
beat
her
taper
foot
upon
the
floor
and
smiled
against
the
shoe
you
re
hard
miss
leigh
unversed
in
current
of
poets
are
fresher
than
the
world
s
highways
forgive
me
that
i
rashly
blew
the
dust
which
dims
our
hedges
even
in
your
eyes
and
vexed
you
so
much
you
find
probably
no
evil
in
this
marriage
good
of
innocence
to
pastoralise
in
song
you
ll
give
the
bond
your
signature
perhaps
beneath
the
lady
s
mark
that
romney
chose
a
wife
could
write
her
name
in
witnessing
he
loved
loved
i
cried
who
tells
you
that
he
wants
a
wife
to
love
he
gets
a
horse
to
use
not
love
i
think
there
s
work
for
wives
as
well
after
straw
when
men
are
liberal
for
myself
you
err
supposing
power
in
me
to
break
this
match
i
could
not
do
it
to
save
romney
s
life
and
would
not
to
save
you
take
it
so
she
said
farewell
then
write
your
books
in
peace
as
far
as
may
be
for
some
secret
stir
now
obvious
to
me
most
obviously
in
coming
hither
i
mistook
the
whereat
she
touched
my
hand
and
bent
her
head
and
floated
from
me
like
a
silent
cloud
that
leaves
the
sense
of
thunder
i
drew
breath
as
hard
as
in
a
sick
room
after
all
this
woman
breaks
her
social
system
up
for
love
so
love
possible
to
such
lilies
are
still
lilies
pulled
by
smutty
hands
though
spotted
from
their
white
and
thus
she
is
better
haply
of
her
kind
than
romney
leigh
who
lives
by
diagrams
and
crosses
out
the
spontaneities
of
all
his
individual
personal
life
with
formal
universals
as
if
man
were
set
upon
a
high
stool
at
a
desk
to
keep
god
s
books
for
him
in
red
and
black
and
feel
by
millions
what
if
even
god
were
chiefly
god
by
living
out
himself
to
an
individualism
of
the
infinite
eterne
intense
profuse
throwing
up
the
golden
spray
of
multitudinous
worlds
in
measure
to
the
proclive
weight
and
rush
of
his
inner
nature
spontaneous
love
still
proof
and
outflow
of
spontaneous
life
then
live
aurora
two
hours
afterward
within
margaret
s
court
i
stood
alone
a
sick
child
from
an
whose
wasted
right
hand
gambled
gainst
his
left
with
an
old
brass
button
in
a
blot
of
sun
jeered
weakly
at
me
as
i
passed
across
the
uneven
pavement
while
a
woman
rouged
upon
the
angular
kerchief
torn
thin
dangling
locks
and
flat
lascivious
mouth
cursed
at
a
window
both
ways
in
and
out
by
turns
some
creature
and
myself
lie
still
there
mother
liker
the
dead
dog
you
ll
be
what
we
pick
our
way
fine
madam
with
those
damnable
small
feet
we
cover
up
our
face
from
doing
good
as
if
it
were
our
purse
what
brings
you
here
my
lady
is
t
to
find
my
gentleman
who
visits
his
tame
pigeon
in
the
eaves
our
cholera
catch
you
with
its
cramps
and
spasms
and
tumble
up
your
good
clothes
veil
and
all
and
turn
your
whiteness
i
looked
up
i
think
i
could
have
walked
through
hell
that
day
and
never
flinched
the
dear
christ
comfort
you
i
said
you
must
have
been
most
miserable
to
be
so
cruel
i
emptied
out
my
purse
upon
the
stones
when
as
i
had
cast
the
last
charm
in
the
cauldron
the
whole
court
went
boiling
bubbling
up
from
all
its
doors
and
windows
with
a
hideous
wail
of
laughs
and
roar
of
oaths
and
blows
perhaps
i
passed
too
quickly
for
distinguishing
and
pushed
a
little
hanging
on
a
hinge
and
plunged
into
the
dark
and
groped
and
climbed
the
long
steep
narrow
stair
twixt
broken
rail
and
mildewed
wall
that
let
the
plaster
drop
to
startle
me
in
the
blackness
still
up
up
so
high
lived
romney
s
bride
i
paused
at
last
before
a
low
door
in
the
roof
and
knocked
there
came
an
answer
like
a
hurried
so
soon
can
that
be
mister
leigh
so
soon
and
as
i
entered
an
ineffable
face
met
mine
upon
the
threshold
oh
not
you
not
you
the
dropping
of
the
voice
implied
then
if
not
you
for
me
not
any
i
looked
her
in
the
eyes
and
held
her
hands
and
said
i
am
his
cousin
leigh
s
and
here
i
m
come
to
see
my
cousin
she
touched
me
with
her
face
and
with
her
voice
this
daughter
of
the
people
such
soft
flowers
from
such
rough
roots
the
people
under
there
can
sin
so
curse
so
look
so
smell
so
faugh
yet
have
such
daughters
no
wise
beautiful
was
marian
erle
she
was
not
white
nor
brown
but
could
look
either
like
a
mist
that
changed
according
to
being
shone
on
more
or
less
the
hair
too
ran
its
opulence
of
curls
in
doubt
twixt
dark
and
bright
nor
left
you
clear
to
name
the
colour
too
much
hair
perhaps
i
ll
name
a
fault
here
for
so
small
a
head
which
seemed
to
droop
on
that
side
and
on
this
as
a
rose
uneasy
with
its
weight
though
not
a
breath
should
trouble
it
again
the
dimple
in
the
cheek
had
better
gone
with
redder
fuller
rounds
and
somewhat
large
the
mouth
was
though
the
milky
little
teeth
dissolved
it
to
so
infantine
a
smile
for
soon
it
smiled
at
me
the
eyes
smiled
too
but
twas
as
if
remembering
they
had
wept
and
knowing
they
should
some
day
weep
again
we
talked
she
told
me
all
her
story
out
which
i
ll
with
fuller
utterance
as
coloured
and
confirmed
in
aftertimes
by
others
and
herself
too
marian
erle
was
born
upon
the
ledge
of
malvern
hill
to
eastward
in
a
hut
built
up
at
night
to
evade
the
landlord
s
eye
of
mud
and
turf
still
liable
if
once
he
looked
that
way
to
being
straight
levelled
scattered
by
his
foot
like
any
other
anthill
born
i
say
god
sent
her
to
his
world
commissioned
right
her
human
testimonials
fully
signed
not
scant
in
in
lineaments
but
others
had
to
swindle
her
a
place
to
wail
in
when
she
had
come
no
place
for
her
by
man
s
law
born
an
outlaw
was
this
babe
her
first
cry
in
our
strange
and
strangling
air
when
cast
in
spasms
out
by
the
shuddering
womb
was
wrong
against
the
social
code
wrong
what
business
had
the
baby
to
cry
there
i
tell
her
story
and
grow
passionate
she
marian
did
not
tell
it
so
but
used
meek
words
that
made
no
wonder
of
herself
for
being
so
sad
a
creature
mister
leigh
considered
truly
that
such
things
should
change
they
in
meantime
on
the
earth
there
s
none
can
like
a
nettle
as
a
pink
except
himself
we
re
nettles
some
of
us
and
give
offence
by
the
act
of
springing
up
and
if
we
leave
the
damp
side
of
the
wall
the
hoes
of
course
are
on
so
she
said
her
father
earned
his
life
by
random
jobs
despised
by
steadier
swine
on
commons
picking
hops
or
hurrying
on
the
harvest
at
wet
seasons
at
need
assisting
the
welsh
drovers
when
a
drove
of
startled
horses
plunged
into
the
mist
below
the
and
sowed
the
wind
with
wandering
neighings
in
between
the
gaps
of
such
irregular
work
he
drank
and
slept
and
cursed
his
wife
because
the
pence
being
out
she
could
not
buy
more
drink
at
which
she
turned
the
worm
and
beat
her
baby
in
revenge
for
her
own
broken
heart
there
s
not
a
crime
but
takes
its
proper
change
out
still
in
crime
if
once
rung
on
the
counter
of
this
world
let
sinners
look
to
it
yet
the
outcast
child
for
whom
the
very
mother
s
face
forewent
the
mother
s
special
patience
lived
and
grew
learnt
early
to
cry
low
and
walk
alone
with
that
pathetic
vacillating
roll
of
the
infant
body
on
the
uncertain
feet
the
earth
being
felt
unstable
ground
so
soon
at
which
most
women
s
arms
unclose
at
once
with
irrepressive
instinct
thus
at
three
this
poor
weaned
kid
would
run
off
from
the
fold
this
babe
would
steal
off
from
the
mother
s
chair
and
creeping
through
the
golden
walls
of
gorse
would
find
some
keyhole
toward
the
secresy
of
heaven
s
high
blue
and
nestling
down
peer
oh
not
to
catch
the
angels
at
their
games
she
had
never
heard
of
angels
to
gaze
she
knew
not
why
to
see
she
knew
not
what
outward
from
the
barren
earth
for
something
like
a
joy
she
liked
she
said
to
dazzle
black
her
sight
against
the
sky
for
then
it
seemed
some
grand
blind
love
came
down
and
groped
her
out
and
clasped
her
with
a
kiss
she
learnt
god
that
way
and
was
beat
for
it
whenever
she
went
home
came
again
as
surely
as
the
trapped
hare
getting
free
returns
to
his
form
this
grand
blind
love
she
said
this
skyey
father
and
mother
both
in
one
instructed
her
and
civilised
her
more
than
even
the
did
afterward
to
which
a
lady
sent
her
to
learn
books
and
sit
upon
a
long
bench
in
a
row
with
other
children
well
she
laughed
sometimes
to
see
them
laugh
and
laugh
and
moil
their
texts
but
ofter
she
was
sorrowful
with
noise
and
wondered
if
their
mothers
beat
them
hard
that
ever
they
should
laugh
so
there
was
one
she
loved
indeed
bell
a
seven
years
child
so
pretty
and
clever
who
read
syllables
when
marian
was
at
letters
would
laugh
at
your
finger
up
she
laughed
then
shook
her
curls
down
on
her
eyes
and
mouth
to
hide
her
from
the
schoolmaster
and
rose
s
pelting
glee
as
frank
as
rain
on
brightened
marian
too
to
see
another
merry
whom
she
loved
she
whispered
once
the
children
side
by
side
with
mutual
arms
entwined
about
their
necks
your
mother
lets
you
laugh
so
ay
said
rose
she
lets
me
she
was
dug
into
the
ground
six
years
since
i
being
but
a
yearling
wean
such
mothers
let
us
play
and
lose
our
time
and
never
scold
nor
beat
us
don
t
you
wish
you
had
one
like
that
there
marian
breaking
off
looked
suddenly
in
my
face
poor
rose
said
she
i
heard
her
laugh
last
night
in
oxford
street
i
d
pour
out
half
my
blood
to
stop
that
laugh
poor
rose
poor
rose
said
marian
she
resumed
it
tried
her
when
she
had
learnt
at
what
god
was
what
he
wanted
from
us
all
and
how
in
choosing
sin
we
vexed
the
christ
to
go
straight
home
and
hear
her
father
pull
the
name
down
on
us
from
the
then
drink
away
his
soul
into
the
dark
from
seeing
judgment
father
mother
home
were
god
and
heaven
reversed
to
her
the
more
she
knew
of
right
the
more
she
guessed
their
wrong
her
price
paid
down
for
knowledge
was
to
know
the
vileness
of
her
kindred
through
her
heart
her
filial
and
tormented
heart
henceforth
they
struck
their
blows
at
virtue
oh
tis
hard
to
learn
you
have
a
father
up
in
heaven
by
a
gathering
certain
sense
of
being
on
earth
still
worse
than
orphaned
tis
too
heavy
a
grief
the
having
to
thank
god
for
such
a
joy
and
so
passed
marian
s
life
from
year
to
year
her
parents
took
her
with
them
when
they
tramped
dodged
lanes
and
heaths
frequented
towns
and
fairs
and
once
went
farther
and
saw
manchester
and
once
the
sea
that
blue
end
of
the
world
that
fair
of
a
wicked
book
and
twice
a
prison
at
intervals
returning
to
the
hills
hills
draw
like
heaven
and
stronger
sometimes
holding
out
their
hands
to
pull
you
from
the
vile
flats
up
to
them
and
though
perhaps
these
strollers
still
strolled
back
as
sheep
do
simply
that
they
knew
the
way
they
certainly
felt
bettered
unawares
emerging
from
the
social
smut
of
towns
to
wipe
their
feet
clean
on
the
in
which
long
wanderings
marian
lived
and
learned
endured
and
learned
the
people
on
the
roads
would
stop
and
ask
her
how
her
eyes
outgrew
her
cheeks
and
if
she
meant
to
lodge
the
birds
in
all
that
hair
and
then
they
lifted
her
the
miller
in
his
cart
a
mile
or
twain
the
butcher
s
boy
on
horseback
often
too
the
pedlar
stopped
and
tapped
her
on
the
head
with
absolute
forefinger
brown
and
ringed
and
asked
if
peradventure
she
could
read
and
when
she
answered
ay
would
toss
her
down
some
stray
odd
volume
from
his
heavy
pack
a
thomson
s
seasons
mulcted
of
the
spring
or
half
a
play
of
shakspeare
s
torn
across
she
had
to
guess
the
bottom
of
a
page
by
just
the
top
sometimes
difficult
as
sitting
on
the
moon
to
guess
the
earth
or
else
a
sheaf
of
leaves
for
that
small
ruth
s
small
gleanings
torn
out
from
the
heart
of
books
from
churchyard
elegies
and
edens
lost
from
burns
and
bunyan
selkirk
and
tom
jones
twas
somewhat
hard
to
keep
the
things
distinct
and
oft
the
jangling
influence
jarred
the
child
like
looking
at
a
sunset
full
of
grace
through
a
pothouse
window
while
the
drunken
oaths
went
on
behind
her
but
she
weeded
out
her
threw
away
the
leaves
that
hurt
first
tore
them
small
that
none
should
find
a
word
and
made
a
nosegay
of
the
sweet
and
good
to
fold
within
her
breast
and
pore
upon
at
broken
moments
of
the
noontide
glare
when
leave
was
given
her
to
untie
her
cloak
and
rest
upon
the
dusty
roadside
bank
from
the
highway
s
dust
or
oft
the
journey
done
some
city
friend
would
lead
her
by
the
hand
to
hear
a
lecture
at
an
institute
and
thus
she
had
grown
this
marian
erle
of
ours
to
no
was
ignorant
of
authors
in
earshot
of
the
things
o
er
the
heads
of
common
men
by
men
who
are
uncommon
within
the
cadenced
hum
of
such
and
capable
of
catching
from
the
fringes
of
the
wind
some
fragmentary
phrases
here
and
there
of
that
fine
music
being
carried
in
to
her
soul
had
reproduced
itself
afresh
in
finer
motions
of
the
lips
and
lids
she
said
in
speaking
of
it
if
a
flower
were
thrown
you
out
of
heaven
at
intervals
you
d
soon
attain
to
a
trick
of
looking
up
and
so
with
she
counted
me
her
years
till
felt
old
and
then
she
counted
me
her
sorrowful
pleasures
till
i
felt
ashamed
she
told
me
she
was
almost
glad
and
calm
on
such
and
such
a
season
sate
and
sewed
with
no
one
to
break
up
her
crystal
thoughts
while
rhymes
from
lovely
poems
span
around
their
ringing
circles
of
ecstatic
tune
beneath
the
moistened
finger
of
the
hour
her
parents
called
her
a
strange
sickly
child
not
good
for
much
and
given
to
sulk
and
stare
and
smile
into
the
hedges
and
the
clouds
and
tremble
if
one
shook
her
from
her
fit
by
any
blow
or
word
even
jobs
went
ill
with
her
and
household
quiet
work
she
was
not
born
to
had
they
kept
the
north
they
might
have
had
their
pennyworth
out
of
her
like
other
parents
in
the
factories
your
children
work
for
you
not
you
for
them
or
else
they
better
had
been
choked
with
air
the
first
breath
drawn
but
in
this
tramping
life
was
nothing
to
be
done
with
such
a
child
but
tramp
and
tramp
and
yet
she
knitted
hose
not
ill
and
was
not
dull
at
needlework
and
all
the
country
people
gave
her
pence
for
darning
stockings
past
their
natural
age
and
patching
petticoats
from
old
to
new
and
other
light
work
done
for
thrifty
wives
one
day
said
marian
sun
shone
that
her
mother
had
been
badly
beat
and
felt
the
bruises
sore
about
her
wretched
soul
that
must
have
been
she
came
in
suddenly
and
snatching
in
a
sort
of
breathless
rage
her
daughter
s
headgear
comb
let
down
the
hair
upon
her
like
a
sudden
waterfall
and
drew
her
drenched
and
passive
by
the
arm
outside
the
hut
they
lived
in
when
the
child
could
clear
her
blinded
face
from
all
that
stream
of
tresses
there
a
man
stood
with
beast
s
eyes
that
seemed
as
they
would
swallow
her
alive
complete
in
body
and
spirit
hair
and
all
with
burning
stertorous
breath
that
hurt
her
cheek
he
breathed
so
near
the
mother
held
her
tight
saying
hard
between
her
why
wench
why
wench
the
squire
speaks
to
you
squire
s
too
good
he
means
to
set
you
up
and
comfort
us
be
mannerly
at
the
child
turned
round
and
looked
up
piteous
in
the
mother
s
face
be
sure
that
mother
s
will
not
want
another
devil
to
damn
than
such
a
look
oh
mother
then
with
desperate
glance
to
heaven
god
free
me
from
my
mother
she
shrieked
out
these
mothers
are
too
and
with
force
as
passionate
as
fear
she
tore
her
hands
like
lilies
from
the
rocks
from
hers
and
his
and
sprang
down
bounded
headlong
down
the
steep
away
from
if
possible
as
far
as
god
they
yelled
at
her
as
famished
hounds
at
a
hare
she
heard
them
yell
she
felt
her
name
hiss
after
her
from
the
hills
like
shot
from
guns
on
on
and
now
she
had
cast
the
voices
off
with
the
uplands
on
mad
fear
was
running
in
her
feet
and
killing
the
ground
the
white
roads
curled
as
if
she
burnt
them
up
the
green
fields
melted
wayside
trees
fell
back
to
make
room
for
her
then
her
head
grew
vexed
trees
fields
turned
on
her
and
ran
after
her
she
heard
the
quick
pants
of
the
hills
behind
their
keen
air
pricked
her
neck
she
had
lost
her
feet
could
run
no
more
yet
somehow
went
as
fast
the
horizon
red
twixt
steeples
in
the
east
so
sucked
her
forward
forward
while
her
heart
kept
swelling
swelling
till
it
swelled
so
big
it
seemed
to
fill
her
body
then
it
burst
and
overflowed
the
world
and
swamped
the
light
and
now
i
am
dead
and
safe
thought
marian
she
had
dropped
she
had
fainted
when
the
sense
returned
the
night
had
life
s
night
she
was
ware
of
heavy
tumbling
motions
creaking
wheels
the
driver
shouting
to
the
lazy
team
that
swung
their
rankling
bells
against
her
brain
while
through
the
waggon
s
coverture
and
chinks
the
cruel
yellow
morning
pecked
at
her
alive
or
dead
upon
the
straw
inside
at
which
her
soul
ached
back
into
the
dark
and
prayed
no
more
of
a
waggoner
had
found
her
in
a
ditch
beneath
the
moon
as
white
as
moonshine
save
for
the
oozing
blood
at
first
he
thought
her
dead
but
when
he
had
wiped
the
mouth
and
heard
it
sigh
he
raised
her
up
and
laid
her
in
his
waggon
in
the
straw
and
so
conveyed
her
to
the
distant
town
to
which
his
business
called
himself
and
left
that
heap
of
misery
at
the
hospital
she
stirred
place
seemed
new
and
strange
as
death
the
white
strait
bed
with
others
strait
and
white
like
graves
dug
side
by
side
at
measured
lengths
and
quiet
people
walking
in
and
out
with
wonderful
low
voices
and
soft
steps
and
apparitional
equal
care
for
each
astonished
her
with
order
silence
law
and
when
a
gentle
hand
held
out
a
cup
she
took
it
as
you
do
at
sacrament
half
awed
half
melted
being
used
indeed
to
so
much
love
as
makes
the
form
of
love
and
courtesy
of
manners
delicate
drinks
and
rare
white
bread
to
which
some
dying
eyes
were
turned
in
observation
o
my
god
how
sick
we
must
be
ere
we
make
men
just
i
think
it
frets
the
saints
in
heaven
to
see
how
many
desolate
creatures
on
the
earth
have
learnt
the
simple
dues
of
fellowship
and
social
comfort
in
a
hospital
as
marian
did
she
lay
there
stunned
half
tranced
and
wished
at
intervals
of
growing
sense
she
might
be
sicker
yet
if
sickness
made
the
world
so
marvellous
kind
the
air
so
hushed
and
all
her
quiet
as
a
sleep
for
now
she
understood
as
such
things
were
how
sickness
ended
very
oft
in
heaven
among
the
unspoken
raptures
yet
more
sick
and
surelier
happy
then
she
dropped
her
lids
and
folding
up
her
hands
as
flowers
at
night
would
lose
no
moment
of
the
blessed
time
she
lay
and
seethed
in
fever
many
weeks
but
youth
was
strong
and
overcame
the
test
revolted
soul
and
flesh
were
reconciled
and
fetched
back
to
the
necessary
day
and
daylight
duties
she
could
creep
about
the
long
bare
rooms
and
stare
out
drearily
from
any
narrow
window
on
the
street
till
some
one
who
had
nursed
her
as
a
friend
said
coldly
to
her
as
an
enemy
she
had
leave
to
go
next
week
being
well
enough
while
only
her
heart
ached
go
next
week
thought
she
next
week
how
would
it
be
with
her
next
week
let
out
into
that
terrible
street
alone
among
the
pushing
people
to
go
where
one
day
the
last
before
the
dreaded
last
among
the
convalescents
like
herself
prepared
to
go
next
morning
she
sate
dumb
and
heard
half
absently
the
women
talk
how
one
was
famished
for
her
baby
s
the
little
wretch
would
know
her
a
year
old
and
lively
like
his
father
one
was
keen
to
get
to
work
and
fill
some
clamorous
mouths
and
one
was
tender
for
her
dear
goodman
who
had
missed
her
sorely
one
querulous
would
pay
those
scandalous
neighbours
who
had
dared
to
talk
about
her
as
already
dead
and
one
was
proud
and
if
her
sweetheart
luke
had
left
her
for
a
ruddier
face
than
hers
the
gossip
would
be
seen
through
at
a
glance
sweet
riddance
of
such
him
hang
twere
good
to
have
been
as
sick
for
such
an
and
while
they
talked
and
marian
felt
the
worse
for
having
missed
the
worst
of
all
their
wrongs
a
visitor
was
ushered
through
the
wards
and
paused
among
the
talkers
when
he
looked
it
was
as
if
he
spoke
and
when
he
spoke
he
sang
perhaps
said
marian
could
she
tell
she
only
knew
so
much
she
had
chronicled
as
seraphs
might
the
making
of
the
sun
that
he
who
came
and
spake
was
romney
leigh
and
then
and
there
she
saw
and
heard
him
and
when
it
was
her
turn
to
have
the
face
upon
her
those
buzzing
pallid
lips
being
satisfied
with
he
changed
to
marian
saying
and
you
re
going
where
she
moveless
as
a
worm
beneath
a
stone
which
some
one
s
stumbling
foot
has
spurned
aside
writhed
suddenly
astonished
with
the
light
and
breaking
into
sobs
cried
where
i
go
none
asked
me
till
this
moment
can
i
say
where
go
when
it
has
not
seemed
worth
while
to
god
himself
who
thinks
of
every
one
to
think
of
me
and
fix
where
i
shall
go
so
young
he
gently
asked
her
you
have
lost
your
father
and
your
mother
both
she
said
both
lost
my
father
was
burnt
up
with
gin
or
ever
i
sucked
milk
and
so
is
lost
my
mother
sold
me
to
a
man
last
month
and
so
my
mother
s
lost
tis
manifest
and
i
who
fled
from
her
for
miles
and
miles
as
if
i
had
caught
sight
of
the
fires
of
hell
through
some
wild
gap
she
was
my
mother
sir
it
seems
i
shall
be
lost
too
presently
and
so
we
end
all
three
of
poor
child
he
said
such
a
pity
in
his
voice
it
soothed
her
more
than
her
own
tears
poor
child
tis
simple
that
betrayal
by
mother
s
love
should
bring
despair
of
god
s
too
yet
be
taught
he
s
better
to
us
than
many
mothers
are
and
children
can
not
wander
beyond
reach
of
the
sweep
of
his
white
raiment
touch
and
hold
and
if
you
weep
still
weep
where
john
was
laid
while
jesus
loved
she
could
say
the
words
she
told
me
exactly
as
he
uttered
them
a
year
back
since
in
any
doubt
or
dark
they
came
out
like
the
stars
and
shone
on
her
with
just
their
comfort
common
words
perhaps
the
ministers
in
church
might
say
the
same
but
he
made
the
church
with
what
he
spoke
the
difference
was
the
miracle
said
she
then
catching
up
her
smile
to
ravishment
she
added
quickly
i
repeat
his
words
but
not
his
tones
can
any
one
repeat
the
music
of
an
organ
out
of
church
and
when
he
said
poor
child
i
shut
my
eyes
to
feel
how
tenderly
his
voice
broke
through
as
the
broke
on
the
holy
feet
to
let
out
the
rich
medicative
she
told
me
how
he
had
raised
and
rescued
her
with
reverent
pity
as
in
touching
grief
he
touched
the
wounds
of
christ
made
her
feel
more
hope
he
called
belief
in
god
worship
therefore
let
us
pray
and
thus
to
snatch
her
soul
from
atheism
and
keep
it
stainless
from
her
mother
s
face
he
sent
her
to
a
famous
far
off
in
london
there
to
work
and
hope
with
that
they
parted
she
kept
sight
of
heaven
but
not
of
romney
he
had
good
to
do
to
others
through
the
days
and
through
the
nights
she
sewed
and
sewed
and
sewed
she
drooped
sometimes
and
wondered
while
along
the
tawny
light
she
struck
the
new
thread
into
her
needle
s
eye
how
people
without
mothers
on
the
hills
could
choose
the
town
to
live
in
she
drew
the
stitch
and
mused
how
romney
s
face
would
look
and
if
twere
likely
he
d
remember
hers
when
they
two
had
their
meeting
after
death
fourth
book
they
met
still
sooner
twas
a
year
from
thence
when
lucy
gresham
the
sick
sempstress
girl
who
sewed
by
marian
s
chair
so
still
and
quick
and
leant
her
head
upon
the
back
to
cough
more
freely
when
the
mistress
turning
round
the
others
took
occasion
to
laugh
out
gave
up
at
last
among
the
workers
spoke
a
bold
girl
with
black
eyebrows
and
red
lips
you
know
the
news
who
s
dying
do
you
think
our
lucy
gresham
i
expected
it
as
little
as
nell
hart
s
wedding
blush
not
nell
thy
curls
be
red
enough
without
thy
cheeks
and
some
day
there
ll
be
found
a
man
to
dote
on
red
gresham
swooned
last
night
dropped
sudden
in
the
street
while
going
home
and
now
the
baker
says
who
took
her
up
and
laid
her
by
her
grandmother
in
bed
he
ll
give
her
a
week
to
die
in
pass
the
silk
let
s
hope
he
gave
her
a
loaf
too
within
reach
for
otherwise
they
ll
starve
before
they
die
that
funny
pair
of
bedfellows
miss
bell
i
ll
thank
you
for
the
scissors
the
old
crone
is
s
the
reason
why
our
lucy
s
thread
went
faster
than
her
breath
which
went
too
quick
we
all
know
marian
erle
why
marian
erle
you
re
not
the
fool
to
cry
your
tears
spoil
lady
waldemar
s
new
dress
you
piece
of
pity
marian
rose
up
straight
and
breaking
through
the
talk
and
through
the
work
went
outward
in
the
face
of
their
surprise
to
lucy
s
home
to
nurse
her
back
to
life
or
down
to
death
she
knew
by
such
an
act
all
place
and
grace
were
forfeit
in
the
house
whose
mistress
would
supply
the
missing
hand
with
necessary
not
inhuman
haste
and
take
no
blame
but
pity
too
had
dues
she
could
not
leave
a
solitary
soul
to
founder
in
the
dark
while
she
sate
still
and
lavished
stitches
on
a
lady
s
hem
as
if
no
other
work
were
paramount
why
god
thought
marian
has
a
missing
hand
this
moment
lucy
wants
a
drink
perhaps
let
others
miss
me
never
miss
me
god
so
marian
sate
by
lucy
s
bed
content
with
duty
and
was
strong
for
recompense
to
hold
the
lamp
of
human
love
to
catch
the
eyes
and
comfort
them
until
the
angels
on
the
luminous
side
of
death
had
got
theirs
ready
and
she
said
when
lucy
thanked
her
sometimes
called
her
kind
it
touched
her
strangely
marian
erle
called
kind
what
marian
beaten
and
sold
who
could
not
die
tis
verily
good
fortune
to
be
kind
ah
you
she
said
who
are
born
to
such
a
grace
be
sorry
for
the
unlicensed
class
the
poor
reduced
to
think
the
best
good
fortune
means
that
others
simply
should
be
kind
to
from
sleep
to
sleep
while
lucy
slid
away
so
gently
like
the
light
upon
a
hill
of
which
none
names
the
moment
that
it
goes
though
all
see
when
tis
gone
man
came
in
and
stood
beside
the
bed
the
old
idiot
wretch
screamed
feebly
like
a
baby
overlain
sir
sir
you
won
t
mistake
me
for
the
corpse
don
t
look
at
sir
never
bury
although
i
lie
here
i
m
alive
as
you
except
my
legs
and
arms
eat
and
drink
and
understand
that
you
re
the
gentleman
who
fits
the
funerals
up
heaven
speed
you
sir
and
certainly
i
should
be
livelier
still
if
lucy
here
sir
lucy
is
the
corpse
had
worked
more
properly
to
buy
me
wine
but
lucy
sir
was
always
slow
at
work
i
shan
t
lose
much
by
lucy
marian
erle
speak
up
and
show
the
gentleman
the
and
then
a
voice
said
marian
she
rose
it
was
the
hour
for
stood
hers
she
scarcely
marvelled
to
see
romney
leigh
as
light
november
snows
to
empty
nests
as
grass
to
graves
as
moss
to
mildewed
stones
as
july
suns
to
ruins
through
the
rents
as
ministering
spirits
to
mourners
through
a
loss
as
heaven
itself
to
men
through
pangs
of
death
he
came
uncalled
wherever
grief
had
come
and
so
said
marian
erle
we
met
anew
and
added
softly
so
we
shall
not
he
was
not
angry
that
she
had
left
the
house
wherein
he
placed
her
had
feared
it
might
have
vexed
him
also
when
he
found
her
set
on
keeping
though
the
dead
was
out
of
sight
that
body
left
behind
with
cankerous
heart
and
flesh
took
your
best
and
cursed
you
for
the
little
good
it
did
could
any
leave
the
bedrid
wretch
alone
so
joyless
she
was
thankless
even
to
god
much
less
to
you
he
did
not
say
twas
well
yet
marian
thought
he
did
not
take
it
ill
since
day
by
day
he
came
and
every
day
she
felt
within
his
utterance
and
his
eyes
a
closer
tenderer
presence
of
the
soul
until
at
last
he
said
we
shall
not
on
that
same
day
was
marian
s
work
complete
she
had
smoothed
the
empty
bed
and
swept
the
floor
of
coffin
sawdust
set
the
chairs
anew
the
dead
had
ended
gossip
in
and
stood
in
that
poor
room
so
cold
and
orderly
the
in
her
hand
prepared
to
go
as
had
howbeit
not
their

spoke
dear
marian
of
one
clay
god
made
us
all
and
though
men
push
and
poke
and
paddle
in
t
as
children
play
at
fashioning
and
call
their
fancies
by
the
name
of
facts
assuming
difference
lordship
privilege
when
all

plain

it
with

we
wait
for
this
you
marian
and
i
romney
she
at
that
looked
blindly
in
his
face
as
when
one
looks
through
driving
to
find
the
sky
he
went
on
speaking
marian
i
being
born
what
men
call
noble
and
you
issued
from
the
noble
people
the
tyrannous
sword
which
pierced
christ
s
heart
has
cleft
the
world
in
twain
twixt
class
and
class
opposing

to

shall
keep
parted
not
so
let
us
lean
and
strain
together
rather
each
to
each
compress
the
red
lips
of
this
gaping
wound
as
far
as
two
souls
can
lean
and
league
i
from
my
superabundance
your
want
you
in
a
protest
gainst
the
wrong
on
both
sides
all
the
rest
he
held
her
hand
in
speaking
which
confused
the
sense
of
much
her
heart
against
his
words
beat
out
so
thick
they
might
as
well
be
written
on
the
dust
where
some
poor
bird
escaping
from
hawk
s
beak
has
dropped
and
beats
its
shuddering
wings
lines
are
rubbed
so
twas
something
like
to
this
that
they
two
standing
at
the
two
extremes
of
social
classes
had
received
one
seal
been
dedicate
and
drawn
beyond
themselves
to
mercy
and
ministration
indeed
through
what
he
knew
and
she
through
what
she
felt
he
by
man
s
conscience
she
by
woman
s
heart
relinquishing
their
several
vantage
posts
of
wealthy
ease
and
honourable
toil
to
work
with
god
at
love
and
since
god
willed
that
putting
out
his
hand
to
touch
this
ark
he
found
a
woman
s
hand
there
he
d
accept
the
sign
too
hold
the
tender
fingers
fast
and
say
my
be
my
wife
she
told
the
tale
with
simple
rustic
turns
strong
leaps
of
meaning
in
her
sudden
eyes
that
took
the
gaps
of
any
imperfect
phrase
of
the
unschooled
speaker
i
have
rather
writ
the
thing
i
understood
so
than
the
thing
i
heard
so
and
i
can
not
render
right
her
quick
gesticulation
wild
yet
soft
from
the
habitual
mood
she
used
half
sad
half
languid
dumb
creatures
now
a
rustling
bird
and
now
a
wandering
deer
or
squirrel
against
the
flashing
up
his
sidelong
burnished
head
in
just
her
way
of
savage
spontaneity
that
stir
abruptly
the
green
silence
of
the
woods
and
make
it
stranger
holier
more
profound
as
nature
s
general
heart
confessed
itself
of
life
and
then
fell
backward
on
repose
i
kissed
the
lips
that
so
indeed
he
loves
you
marian
loves
me
she
looked
up
with
a
child
s
wonder
when
you
ask
him
first
who
made
the
puzzled
blush
that
grew
then
broke
off
in
a
rapid
radiant
smile
of
sure
solution
loves
me
he
loves
all
and
me
of
course
he
had
not
asked
me
else
to
work
with
him
for
ever
and
be
his
her
words
reproved
me
this
perhaps
was
to
have
its
hands
too
full
of
gifts
to
give
for
putting
out
a
hand
to
take
a
gift
to
love
so
much
the
perfect
round
of
love
includes
in
strict
conclusion
the
being
loved
as
went
up
and
fell
again
enough
for
watering
eden
obviously
she
had
not
thought
about
his
love
at
all
the
cataracts
of
her
soul
had
poured
themselves
and
risen
in
rainbow
would
she
ask
who
crowned
her
sufficed
that
she
was
crowned
with
women
of
my
class
tis
otherwise
we
haggle
for
the
small
change
of
our
gold
and
so
much
love
accord
for
so
much
love
are
we
therefore
wrong
if
marriage
be
a
contract
look
to
it
then
contracting
parties
should
be
equal
just
but
if
a
simple
fealty
on
one
side
a
mere
religion
to
give
is
all
and
certain
brides
of
europe
duly
ask
to
mount
the
pile
as
indian
widows
do
the
spices
of
their
tender
youth
heaped
up
the
jewels
of
their
gracious
virtues
worn
more
gems
more
glory
consume
entire
for
a
living
husband
as
the
man
s
alive
not
dead
woman
s
duty
by
so
much
advanced
in
england
beyond
hindostan
i
sate
there
musing
till
she
touched
my
hand
with
hers
as
softly
as
a
strange
white
bird
she
feared
to
startle
in
touching
you
are
kind
but
are
you
peradventure
vexed
at
heart
because
your
cousin
takes
me
for
a
wife
i
know
i
am
not
in
truth
i
m
glad
on
t
since
for
that
he
chooses
me
he
likes
the
poor
things
of
the
world
the
best
i
would
not
therefore
if
i
could
be
rich
it
pleasures
him
to
stoop
for
buttercups
i
would
not
be
a
rose
upon
the
wall
a
queen
might
stop
at
near
the
to
say
to
a
courtier
pluck
that
rose
for
me
it
s
prettier
than
the
rest
o
romney
leigh
i
d
rather
far
be
trodden
by
his
foot
than
lie
in
a
great
queen
s
out
of
breath
she
paused
sweet
marian
do
you
disavow
the
roses
with
that
face
she
dropt
her
head
as
if
the
wind
had
caught
that
flower
of
her
and
bent
it
in
the
garden
looked
up
with
grave
assurance
well
you
think
me
bold
but
so
we
all
are
when
we
re
praying
god
and
if
i
m
lady
credit
me
that
since
i
know
myself
for
what
i
am
much
fitter
for
his
handmaid
than
his
wife
i
ll
prove
the
handmaid
and
the
wife
at
once
serve
tenderly
and
love
obediently
and
be
a
worthier
mate
perhaps
than
some
who
are
wooed
in
silk
among
their
learned
books
while
shall
set
myself
to
read
his
eyes
till
such
grow
plainer
to
me
than
the
french
to
wisest
ladies
do
you
think
i
ll
miss
a
letter
in
the
spelling
of
his
mind
no
more
than
they
do
when
they
sit
and
write
their
flying
words
with
flickering
tails
nor
ever
pause
to
ask
how
many
should
that
be
or
know
t
so
well
i
ve
seen
them
writing
when
i
brought
a
dress
and
waited
out
their
soft
white
hands
on
shining
paper
but
they
re
hard
sometimes
for
all
those
hands
ve
used
out
many
nights
and
worn
the
yellow
daylight
into
shreds
which
flapped
and
shivered
down
our
aching
eyes
till
night
appeared
more
tolerable
just
that
pretty
ladies
might
look
beautiful
who
said
at
last
you
re
lazy
in
that
house
you
re
slow
in
sending
home
the
work
count
i
ve
waited
near
an
hour
for
pardon
me
i
do
not
blame
them
madam
nor
misprize
they
are
fair
and
gracious
ay
but
not
like
you
since
none
but
you
has
mister
leigh
s
own
blood
both
noble
and
gentle
without
it
well
they
are
fair
i
said
so
fair
it
scarce
seems
strange
that
flashing
out
in
any
the
wonder
of
their
glorious
brows
and
breasts
they
are
charmed
so
they
forget
to
look
behind
and
mark
how
pale
we
ve
grown
we
pitiful
remainders
of
the
world
and
so
perhaps
if
mister
leigh
had
chosen
a
wife
from
these
she
might
although
he
s
better
than
her
best
and
dearly
she
would
know
it
steal
a
thought
which
should
be
all
his
an
from
his
face
to
plunge
into
the
mirror
opposite
in
search
of
her
own
beauty
s
pearl
while
ah
dearest
lady
serge
will
outweigh
silk
for
when
bodies
feel
and
i
ll
be
a
true
wife
to
your
cousin
before
i
answered
he
was
there
himself
i
think
he
had
been
standing
in
the
room
and
listened
probably
to
half
her
talk
arrested
turned
to
stone
white
as
stone
will
tender
sayings
make
men
look
so
white
he
loves
her
then
profoundly
you
are
here
aurora
here
i
meet
you
clasped
hands
even
so
dear
romney
lady
waldemar
has
sent
me
in
haste
to
find
a
cousin
of
mine
who
shall
lady
waldemar
is
here
s
one
at
least
who
is
good
i
sighed
and
touched
poor
marian
s
happy
head
as
doglike
she
most
passionately
patient
waited
on
for
her
turn
of
greeting
words
i
ve
sate
a
full
hour
with
your
marian
erle
and
learnt
the
thing
by
heart
from
my
heart
am
therefore
competent
to
give
you
thanks
for
such
a
you
accept
at
last
a
gift
from
me
aurora
without
scorn
at
last
i
please
you
his
voice
was
changed
you
can
not
please
a
woman
against
her
will
and
once
you
vexed
me
shall
we
speak
of
that
we
ll
say
then
you
were
noble
in
it
all
and
i
not
it
pass
and
now
you
please
me
romney
when
you
please
yourself
so
please
you
be
fanatical
in
love
and
i
m
well
pleased
ah
cousin
at
the
old
hall
among
the
gallery
portraits
of
our
leighs
we
shall
not
find
a
sweeter
signory
than
this
pure
forehead
not
a
word
he
said
how
arrogant
men
are
philanthropists
who
try
to
take
a
wife
up
in
the
way
they
put
down
a
once
she
turns
and
says
i
will
not
tax
you
so
most
charitable
sir
ill
at
ease
as
though
she
had
wronged
them
somehow
i
suppose
we
women
should
remember
what
we
are
and
not
throw
back
an
obolus
inscribed
with
cæsar
s
image
lightly
i
resumed
it
strikes
me
some
of
those
sublime
vandykes
were
not
too
proud
to
make
good
saints
in
heaven
and
if
so
then
they
re
not
too
proud
to
bow
down
now
the
ruffs
are
off
their
necks
and
own
this
good
true
noble
marian
yours
and
mine
i
ll
say
poets
bear
the
word
even
are
still
whole
democrats
oh
not
that
we
re
disloyal
to
the
high
but
loyal
to
the
low
and
cognisant
of
the
less
scrutable
majesties
for
me
i
comprehend
your
justify
your
right
in
no
no
no
he
sighed
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
impatient
scorn
as
some
grown
man
who
never
had
a
child
puts
by
some
child
who
plays
at
being
a
man
you
did
not
do
not
can
not
comprehend
my
choice
my
ends
my
motives
nor
myself
no
matter
ll
let
it
pass
you
say
i
thank
you
for
your
generous
cousinship
which
helps
this
present
i
accept
for
her
your
favourable
thoughts
we
re
fallen
on
days
we
two
who
are
not
poets
when
to
wed
requires
less
mutual
love
than
common
love
for
two
together
to
bear
out
at
once
upon
the
loveless
many
work
in
pairs
in
or
in
the
difference
lies
in
the
honour
not
the
work
and
such
we
re
bound
to
i
and
she
but
love
you
poets
are
benighted
in
this
age
the
hour
s
too
late
for
catching
even
moths
you
ve
gnats
instead
love
s
is
out
of
date
like
adam
s
set
a
swan
to
swim
the
trenton
rather
than
true
love
to
float
its
fabulous
plumage
safely
down
the
cataracts
of
this
loud
whose
roar
for
ever
henceforth
in
my
ears
must
keep
me
deaf
to
there
i
turned
and
kissed
poor
marian
out
of
discontent
the
man
had
baffled
chafed
me
till
i
flung
for
refuge
to
the
woman
sometimes
impatient
of
some
crowded
room
s
close
smell
you
throw
a
window
open
and
lean
out
to
breathe
a
long
breath
in
the
dewy
night
and
cool
your
angry
forehead
she
at
least
was
not
built
up
as
walls
are
brick
by
brick
each
fancy
squared
each
feeling
ranged
by
line
the
very
heat
of
burning
youth
applied
to
indurate
forms
and
systems
excellent
bricks
a
wall
stops
you
on
the
road
and
into
which
you
can
not
see
an
inch
although
you
beat
your
head
against
adieu
i
said
for
this
time
cousins
both
and
cousin
romney
pardon
me
the
word
be
happy
in
some
esoteric
sense
of
course
mean
no
harm
in
wishing
well
adieu
my
marian
she
come
to
me
dear
romney
and
be
married
from
my
house
it
is
not
part
of
your
philosophy
to
keep
your
bird
upon
the
blackthorn
ay
he
answered
but
it
is
take
my
wife
directly
from
the
people
she
comes
as
austria
s
daughter
to
imperial
france
betwixt
her
eagles
blinking
not
her
race
from
margaret
s
court
at
to
meet
and
wed
me
at
james
s
nor
put
off
her
gown
of
serge
for
that
the
things
we
do
we
do
we
ll
wear
no
mask
as
if
we
dear
romney
you
re
the
poet
i
replied
but
felt
my
smile
too
mournful
for
my
word
and
turned
and
went
ay
masks
i
thought
of
tragic
masks
we
tie
before
the
glass
uplifted
on
the
cothurn
half
a
yard
above
the
natural
stature
we
would
play
heroic
parts
to
ourselves
end
perhaps
as
impotently
as
athenian
wives
who
shrieked
in
fits
at
the
eumenides
his
foot
pursued
me
down
the
stair
at
least
you
ll
suffer
me
to
walk
with
you
beyond
these
hideous
streets
these
graves
where
men
alive
packed
close
with
earthworms
burr
unconsciously
about
the
plague
that
slew
them
let
me
go
the
very
women
pelt
their
souls
in
mud
at
any
woman
who
walks
here
alone
how
came
you
here
alone
are
we
had
a
strange
and
melancholy
walk
the
night
came
drizzling
downward
in
dark
rain
and
as
we
walked
the
colour
of
the
time
the
act
the
presence
my
hand
upon
his
arm
his
voice
in
my
ear
and
mine
to
my
own
sense
appeared
unnatural
we
talked
modern
books
and
daily
papers
spanish
and
english
t
so
cold
last
year
and
will
the
wind
change
by
morn
can
guizot
stand
is
london
full
is
trade
competitive
has
dickens
turned
his
hinge
upon
the
fingers
of
the
great
and
are
potatoes
to
grow
mythical
like
moly
will
the
apple
die
out
too
which
way
is
the
wind
due
east
we
talked
on
fast
while
every
common
word
seemed
tangled
with
the
thunder
at
one
end
and
ready
to
pull
down
upon
our
heads
a
terror
out
of
sight
and
yet
to
pause
were
surelier
mortal
we
tore
greedily
up
all
silence
all
the
innocent
as
if
like
pale
conspirators
in
haste
we
tore
up
papers
where
our
signatures
imperilled
us
to
an
ugly
shame
or
death
i
can
not
tell
you
why
it
was
tis
plain
we
had
not
loved
nor
hated
wherefore
dread
to
spill
gunpowder
on
ground
safe
from
fire
perhaps
we
had
lived
too
closely
to
diverge
so
absolutely
leave
two
clocks
they
say
wound
up
to
different
hours
upon
one
shelf
and
slowly
through
the
interior
wheels
of
each
the
blind
mechanic
motion
sets
itself
to
feel
out
for
the
mutual
time
it
was
not
so
with
us
indeed
while
he
struck
midnight
i
kept
striking
six
at
dawn
while
he
marked
judgment
i
and
such
exception
to
a
general
law
imperious
upon
inert
matter
even
might
make
us
each
to
either
insecure
a
beckoning
mystery
or
a
troubling
fear
i
mind
me
when
we
parted
at
the
door
how
strange
his
sounded
beside
a
deathbed
where
the
morrow
s
sun
is
sure
to
come
too
late
for
more
and
all
that
night
i
thought
said
he
and
so
a
month
passed
let
me
set
it
down
at
once
have
been
wrong
i
have
been
wrong
we
are
wrong
always
when
we
think
too
much
of
what
we
think
or
are
albeit
our
thoughts
be
verily
bitter
as
we
re
no
less
selfish
if
we
sleep
on
rocks
or
roses
sleeping
past
the
hour
of
noon
we
re
lazy
this
i
write
against
myself
i
had
done
a
duty
in
the
visit
paid
to
marian
and
was
ready
otherwise
to
give
the
witness
of
my
presence
and
name
whenever
she
should
i
thought
sufficed
i
even
had
cast
into
the
scale
an
overweight
of
justice
toward
the
match
the
lady
waldemar
had
missed
her
tool
had
broken
it
in
the
lock
as
being
too
straight
for
a
crooked
purpose
while
poor
marian
erle
missed
nothing
in
my
accents
or
my
acts
i
had
not
been
ungenerous
on
the
whole
nor
yet
untender
so
enough
i
felt
tired
overworked
this
marriage
somewhat
jarred
or
if
it
did
not
all
the
bridal
noise
the
pricking
of
the
map
of
life
with
pins
in
schemes
of
here
we
ll
go
and
there
we
ll
stay
and
everywhere
we
ll
prosper
in
our
love
was
scarce
my
business
let
them
order
it
who
else
should
care
i
threw
myself
aside
as
one
who
had
done
her
work
and
shuts
her
eyes
to
rest
the
better
i
who
should
have
known
forereckoned
mischief
where
we
disavow
being
keeper
to
our
brother
we
re
his
cain
i
might
have
held
that
poor
child
to
my
heart
a
little
longer
twould
have
hurt
me
much
to
have
hastened
by
its
beats
the
and
kept
her
safe
meantime
from
tampering
hands
or
peradventure
traps
what
drew
me
back
from
telling
romney
plainly
the
designs
of
lady
waldemar
as
spoken
out
to
me
me
had
i
any
right
ay
right
with
womanly
compassion
and
reserve
to
break
the
fall
of
woman
s
impudence
to
stand
by
calmly
knowing
what
i
knew
and
hear
him
call
her
distrust
that
word
there
is
none
good
save
god
said
jesus
christ
if
he
once
in
the
first
called
creatures
good
ever
afterward
the
devil
only
has
done
it
and
his
heirs
the
knaves
who
win
so
and
the
fools
who
lose
the
word
s
grown
dangerous
in
the
middle
age
i
think
they
called
malignant
fays
and
imps
good
people
a
good
neighbour
even
in
this
is
fatal
sometimes
your
morning
up
to
of
the
very
smallest
talk
then
helps
to
sugar
her
bohea
at
night
with
your
reputation
i
have
known
good
wives
as
chaste
or
nearly
so
as
potiphar
s
and
good
good
mothers
who
would
use
a
child
to
better
an
intrigue
good
friends
beside
very
good
who
hung
succinctly
round
your
neck
and
sucked
your
breath
as
cats
are
fabled
to
do
by
sleeping
infants
and
we
all
have
known
good
critics
who
have
stamped
out
poet
s
hopes
good
statesmen
who
pulled
ruin
on
the
state
good
patriots
who
for
a
theory
risked
a
cause
good
kings
who
disembowelled
for
a
tax
good
popes
who
brought
all
good
to
jeopardy
good
christians
who
sate
still
in
easy
chairs
and
damned
the
general
world
for
standing
now
may
the
good
god
pardon
all
good
men
how
bitterly
i
speak
certainly
the
innocent
white
milk
in
us
is
turned
by
much
persistent
shining
of
the
sun
shake
up
the
sweetest
in
us
long
enough
with
men
it
drops
to
foolish
curd
too
sour
to
feed
the
most
untender
of
christ
s
lambs
i
should
have
thought
a
woman
of
the
world
like
her
i
m
meaning
to
herself
who
has
wheeled
on
her
own
pivot
half
a
life
in
isolated
and
as
a
windmill
seen
at
distance
radiating
its
delicate
white
vans
against
the
sky
so
soft
and
soundless
simply
beautiful
seen
nearer
what
a
roar
and
tear
it
makes
how
it
grinds
and
bruises
if
she
loves
at
last
her
love
s
a
of
no
more
a
need
felt
of
another
s
use
to
her
one
advantage
the
mill
wants
grain
the
fire
wants
fuel
the
very
wolf
wants
prey
and
none
of
these
is
more
unscrupulous
than
such
a
charming
woman
when
she
loves
she
ll
not
be
thwarted
by
an
obstacle
so
trifling
as
her
soul
is
much
less
yours
is
god
a
consideration
loves
not
god
she
will
not
flinch
for
him
indeed
she
did
not
for
the
marchioness
of
perth
when
wanting
tickets
for
the
she
loves
you
sir
with
passion
to
lunacy
she
loves
you
like
her
diamonds
almost
well
a
month
passed
so
and
then
the
notice
came
on
such
a
day
the
marriage
at
the
church
i
was
not
backward
half
giles
in
frieze
was
bidden
to
meet
james
in
cloth
of
gold
and
after
contract
at
the
altar
pass
to
eat
a
on
hampstead
heath
of
course
the
people
came
in
uncompelled
lame
blind
and
sorrowful
and
worse
the
humours
of
the
peccant
social
wound
all
pressed
out
poured
out
upon
pimlico
exasperating
the
unaccustomed
air
with
hideous
interfusion
you
d
suppose
a
finished
generation
dead
of
plague
swept
outward
from
their
graves
into
the
sun
the
moil
of
death
upon
them
what
a
sight
a
holiday
of
miserable
men
is
sadder
than
a
of
kings
they
clogged
the
streets
they
oozed
into
the
church
in
a
dark
slow
stream
like
blood
to
see
that
sight
the
noble
ladies
stood
up
in
their
pews
some
pale
for
fear
a
few
as
red
for
hate
some
simply
curious
some
just
insolent
and
some
in
wondering
scorn
what
next
what
next
these
crushed
their
delicate
from
the
smile
that
misbecame
them
in
a
holy
place
with
broidered
hems
of
perfumed
handkerchiefs
those
passed
the
salts
with
confidence
of
eyes
and
simultaneous
shiver
of
moiré
silk
while
all
the
aisles
alive
and
black
with
heads
crawled
slowly
toward
the
altar
from
the
street
as
bruised
snakes
crawl
and
hiss
out
of
a
hole
with
shuddering
involutions
swaying
slow
from
right
to
left
and
then
from
left
to
right
in
pants
and
pauses
what
an
ugly
crest
of
faces
rose
upon
you
everywhere
from
that
crammed
mass
you
did
not
usually
see
faces
like
them
in
the
open
day
they
hide
in
cellars
not
to
make
you
mad
as
romney
leigh
my
god
we
call
those
faces
men
s
and
women
s
ay
and
children
s
hanging
like
a
rag
forgotten
on
their
mother
s
neck
mouths
wiped
clean
of
mother
s
milk
by
mother
s
blow
before
they
are
taught
her
cursing
faces
phew
we
ll
call
them
vices
festering
to
despairs
or
sorrows
petrifying
to
vices
not
a
of
god
left
whole
on
them
all
ruined
countenance
worn
out
as
the
garments
the
will
dissolute
as
the
acts
the
passions
loose
and
draggling
in
the
dirt
to
trip
the
foot
up
at
the
first
free
step
those
faces
twas
as
if
you
had
stirred
up
hell
to
heave
its
lowest
uppermost
in
fiery
swirls
of
slime
strangled
fronts
such
obdurate
jaws
were
thrown
up
constantly
to
twit
you
with
your
race
corrupt
your
blood
and
grind
to
devilish
colours
all
your
dreams
henceforth
though
haply
you
should
drop
asleep
by
clink
of
silver
waters
in
a
muse
on
raffael
s
mild
madonna
of
the
bird
i
ve
waked
and
slept
through
many
nights
and
days
since
then
still
that
day
will
catch
my
breath
like
a
nightmare
there
are
fatal
days
indeed
in
which
the
fibrous
years
have
taken
root
so
deeply
that
they
quiver
to
their
tops
whene
er
you
stir
the
dust
of
such
a
day
my
cousin
met
me
with
his
eyes
and
hand
and
then
with
just
a
word
that
marian
erle
was
coming
with
her
bridesmaids
presently
made
haste
to
place
me
by
the
where
he
and
other
noble
gentlemen
and
ladies
waited
for
the
bride
we
waited
it
was
early
there
was
time
for
greeting
and
the
morning
s
compliment
and
gradually
a
ripple
of
women
s
talk
arose
and
fell
and
tossed
about
a
spray
of
english
soft
as
a
silent
hush
and
notwithstanding
quite
as
audible
as
louder
phrases
thrown
out
by
the
men
yes
really
if
we
ve
need
to
wait
in
church
we
ve
need
to
talk
she
tis
lady

stream
of
milk
there

things

with
great
eyes
i
d
go
through
fire
to
look
at
you

and
lady

sitting
close
to

little
flushed

and
organised

folly

except
she

asked
me
she
d
have
served
him
more
by
marrying
him
she
comes
the
bride
at
last
indeed
no
past
eleven
she
puts
off
her
patched
petticoat
and
puts
on
manners
so
begins
by
setting
us
to
yes
yes
this
leigh
was
always
odd
it
s
in
the
blood
i
think
his
father
s
uncle
s
cousin
s
second
son
was
was
you
understand
for
him
he
s
stark
turned
quite
lunatic
upon
this
modern
question
of
the
poor
an
excellent
subject
when
you
re
moderate
you
ve
seen
prince
albert
s
model
does
honour
to
his
royal
highness
good
but
would
he
stop
his
carriage
in
cheapside
to
shake
a
common
fellow
by
the
fist
whose
name
was
shakspeare
no
we
draw
a
line
and
if
we
stand
not
by
our
order
we
in
england
we
fall
headlong
here
s
a
sight
a
hideous
sight
a
most
indecent
sight
my
wife
would
come
sir
or
i
had
kept
her
back
by
heaven
sir
when
poor
damiens
trunk
and
limbs
were
torn
by
horses
women
of
the
court
stood
by
and
stared
exactly
as
on
this
dismembering
of
society
with
pretty
troubled
now
at
last
she
comes
where
who
sees
you
push
me
sir
beyond
the
point
of
what
is
mannerly
you
re
standing
madam
on
my
second
i
do
beseech
s
not
the
bride
eleven
how
late
the
bridegroom
mark
gets
anxious
and
goes
and
as
i
said
these
leighs
our
best
blood
running
in
the
rut
it
s
something
awful
we
had
pardoned
him
a
simple
misalliance
got
up
aside
for
a
pair
of
eyes
our
house
of
lords
has
winked
at
such
things
and
we
ve
all
been
young
but
here
s
an
reasoned
out
a
contract
carried
boldly
to
the
light
to
challenge
observation
pioneer
good
acts
by
a
great
example
twixt
the
extremes
of
martyrised
society
the
left
the
the
right
the
merest
mob
to
treat
as
equals
tis
anarchical
it
means
more
than
it
tis
damnable
why
sir
we
can
t
have
even
our
coffee
good
unless
we
strain
here
miss
leigh
lord
howe
you
re
romney
s
friend
what
s
all
this
waiting
for
i
can
not
tell
the
bride
has
lost
her
head
and
way
perhaps
to
prove
her
sympathy
with
the
what
also
disapprove
oh
approve
of
nothing
in
the
world
he
answered
not
of
you
still
less
of
me
nor
even
of
he
s
worth
us
both
we
re
all
gone
wrong
the
tune
in
us
is
lost
and
whistling
in
back
alleys
to
the
moon
will
never
catch
let
me
draw
lord
howe
a
born
aristocrat
bred
radical
and
educated
socialist
who
still
goes
floating
on
traditions
of
his
kind
across
the
theoretic
flood
from
france
though
like
a
drenched
noah
on
a
rotten
deck
scarce
safer
for
his
place
there
he
at
least
will
never
land
on
ararat
he
knows
to
recommence
the
world
on
the
old
plan
indeed
he
thinks
said
world
had
better
end
he
sympathises
rather
with
the
fish
outside
than
with
the
drowned
paired
beasts
within
who
can
not
couple
again
or
multiply
and
that
s
the
sort
of
noah
he
is
lord
howe
he
never
could
be
anything
complete
except
a
loyal
upright
gentleman
a
liberal
landlord
graceful
and
entertainer
more
than
hospitable
whom
authors
dine
with
and
forget
the
port
whatever
he
believes
and
it
is
much
but
certain
now
here
and
now
there
he
still
has
sympathies
beyond
his
creed
diverting
him
from
action
in
the
house
no
party
counts
upon
him
and
all
praise
all
like
his
books
too
he
has
written
books
which
good
to
lie
beside
a
bishop
s
chair
so
oft
outreach
themselves
with
jets
of
fire
at
which
the
foremost
of
the
progressists
may
warm
audacious
hands
in
passing
by
stature
lounging
for
ease
light
hair
that
seems
to
carry
a
wind
in
it
and
eyes
that
when
they
look
on
you
will
lean
their
whole
weight
half
in
indolence
and
half
in
wishing
you
unmitigated
good
until
you
know
not
if
to
flinch
from
him
or
thank
tis
lord
howe
we
re
all
gone
wrong
said
he
and
romney
that
dear
friend
of
ours
is
right
there
s
one
true
thing
on
earth
that
s
love
he
takes
it
up
and
dresses
it
and
acts
a
play
with
it
as
hamlet
did
to
show
what
cruel
uncles
we
have
been
and
how
we
should
be
uneasy
in
our
minds
while
he
prince
hamlet
weds
a
pretty
maid
who
keeps
us
too
long
waiting
we
ll
confess
by
symbol
to
instruct
us
formally
to
fill
the
ditches
up
twixt
class
and
class
and
live
together
in
phalansteries
what
then
s
mad
our
hamlet
clap
his
play
and
bind
ah
lord
howe
this
spectacle
pulls
stronger
at
us
than
the
dane
s
see
there
the
crammed
aisles
heave
and
strain
and
steam
with
dear
heaven
what
life
why
yes
poet
sees
which
makes
him
different
from
a
common
man
too
see
somewhat
though
i
can
not
sing
i
should
have
been
a
poet
only
that
my
mother
took
fright
at
the
ugly
world
and
bore
me
if
you
ll
grant
me
now
that
romney
gives
us
a
fine
to
make
us
merry
on
his
the
fable
s
worse
than
hamlet
s
i
ll
concede
the
terrible
people
old
and
poor
and
blind
their
eyes
eat
out
with
plague
and
poverty
from
seeing
beautiful
and
cheerful
sights
we
ll
liken
to
a
brutalised
king
lear
led
out
no
means
to
clear
scores
with
his
wrongs
are
so
far
back
he
has
forgot
all
s
past
like
youth
but
just
to
witness
here
a
simple
contract
upon
his
side
and
regan
with
her
sister
goneril
and
all
the
dappled
courtiers
and
on
their
side
not
that
any
of
these
would
say
they
re
sorry
neither
what
is
done
is
done
and
violence
is
now
turned
privilege
as
cream
turns
cheese
if
buried
long
enough
what
could
such
lovely
ladies
have
to
do
with
the
old
man
there
in
those
rags
except
to
keep
the
of
him
lear
is
flat
and
quiet
as
a
decent
grave
he
does
not
curse
his
daughters
in
the
least
these
his
daughters
lear
is
thinking
of
his
porridge
chiefly
is
it
getting
cold
at
hampstead
will
the

be
served
in
pots
poor
lear
poor
daughters
bravo
romney
s
play
a
murmur
and
a
movement
drew
around
a
naked
whisper
touched
us
something
wrong
what
s
wrong
the
black
crowd
as
an
overstrained
cord
quivered
in
vibrations
and
i
saw
was
that
face
i
saw
his
romney
leigh
s
which
tossed
a
sudden
horror
like
a
sponge
into
all
eyes
himself
stood
white
upon
the
topmost
and
tried
to
speak
and
failed
and
lifted
higher
above
his
head
a
letter
as
a
man
who
drowns
and
gasps
my
brothers
bear
with
me
i
am
very
weak
i
meant
but
only
good
perhaps
i
meant
too
proudly
god
snatched
the
circumstance
and
changed
it
therefore
there
s
no
she
leaves
me
departs
disappears
i
lose
her
yet
i
never
forced
her
ay
to
have
her
no
so
cast
into
my
teeth
in
manner
of
an
accusation
thus
my
friends
you
are
all
dismissed
go
eat
and
drink
according
to
the
programme
farewell
he
ended
there
was
silence
in
the
church
we
heard
a
baby
sucking
in
its
sleep
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
aisle
then
spoke
a
man
now
look
to
it
coves
that
all
the
beef
and
drink
be
not
filched
from
us
like
the
other
fun
for
beer
s
spilt
easier
than
a
woman
is
this
gentry
is
not
honest
with
the
poor
they
bring
us
up
to
trick
go
it
jim
a
woman
screamed
back
i
m
a
tender
soul
i
never
banged
a
child
at
two
years
old
and
drew
blood
from
him
but
i
sobbed
for
it
next
moment
i
ve
had
a
plague
of
seven
i
m
tender
i
ve
no
stomach
even
for
beef
until
i
know
about
the
girl
that
s
lost
that
s
killed
mayhap
i
did
misdoubt
at
first
the
fine
lord
meant
no
good
by
her
or
us
he
maybe
got
the
upper
hand
of
her
by
holding
up
a
and
then
a
choking
finger
on
her
throat
last
night
and
just
a
clever
tale
to
keep
us
still
as
she
is
poor
lost
innocent
disappear
who
ever
disappears
except
a
ghost
and
who
believes
a
story
of
a
ghost
i
ask
you
a
girl
go
off
instead
of
staying
to
be
married
a
fine
tale
a
wicked
man
i
say
a
wicked
man
for
my
part
i
would
rather
starve
on
gin
than
make
my
dinner
on
his
beef
and
at
which
a
cry
rose
we
ll
have
our
rights
we
ll
have
the
girl
the
girl
your
ladies
there
are
married
safely
and
smoothly
every
day
and
shall
not
drop
through
into
a
trap
because
she
s
poor
and
of
the
people
shame
we
ll
have
no
tricks
played
off
by
gentlefolks
we
ll
see
her
through
the
rage
and
roar
i
heard
the
broken
words
which
romney
flung
among
the
turbulent
masses
from
the
ground
he
held
still
with
his
masterful
pale
as
huntsmen
throw
the
ration
to
the
pack
who
falling
on
it
headlong
dog
on
dog
in
heaps
of
fury
rend
it
swallow
it
up
with
yelling
indignant
words
his
piteous
words
his
most
pathetic
words
whereof
i
caught
the
meaning
here
and
there
by
his
gesture
torn
in
morsels
yelled
across
and
so
devoured
from
end
to
end
the
church
rocked
round
us
like
the
sea
in
storm
and
then
broke
up
like
the
earth
in
earthquake
men
cried
out
police
women
stood
and
shrieked
for
god
or
dropt
and
swooned
or
like
a
herd
of
deer
for
whom
the
black
woods
suddenly
grow
alive
unleashing
their
wild
shadows
down
the
wind
to
hunt
the
creatures
into
corners
back
and
forward
madly
fled
or
blindly
fell
trod
screeching
underneath
the
feet
of
those
who
fled
and
screeched
the
last
sight
left
to
me
was
romney
s
terrible
calm
face
above
the
tumult
last
sound
was
pull
him
down
him
stretching
my
unreasoning
arms
as
men
in
dreams
who
vainly
interpose
twixt
gods
and
their
undoing
with
a
cry
i
struggled
to
precipitate
myself
to
the
rescue
of
my
soul
in
that
white
face
till
some
one
caught
me
back
and
so
the
world
went
out
felt
no
more
what
followed
was
told
after
by
lord
howe
who
bore
me
senseless
from
the
strangling
crowd
in
church
and
street
and
then
returned
alone
to
see
the
tumult
quelled
the
men
of
law
had
fallen
as
thunder
on
a
roaring
fire
and
made
all
silent
the
people
s
smoke
passed
eddying
slowly
from
the
emptied
aisles
here
s
marian
s
letter
which
a
ragged
child
brought
running
just
as
romney
at
the
porch
looked
out
expectant
of
the
bride
he
sent
the
letter
to
me
by
his
friend
lord
howe
some
two
hours
after
folded
in
a
sheet
on
which
his
hand
had
left
a
word
here
s
marian
s
letter
noble
friend
dear
saint
be
patient
with
me
never
think
me
vile
who
might
morning
be
your
wife
but
that
i
loved
you
more
than
such
a
name
farewell
my
romney
let
me
write
it
once
my
romney
tis
so
pretty
a
coupled
word
i
have
no
heart
to
pluck
it
with
a
blot
we
say
my
god
sometimes
upon
our
knees
who
is
not
therefore
vexed
so
bear
with
it
and
me
i
know
i
m
foolish
weak
and
vain
yet
most
of
all
i
m
angry
with
myself
for
losing
your
last
footstep
on
the
stair
that
last
time
of
your
coming
the
very
first
time
i
lost
step
of
yours
its
sweetness
comes
the
next
to
what
you
speak
but
yesterday
sobs
took
me
by
the
throat
and
cut
me
off
from
music
mister
leigh
you
ll
set
me
down
as
wrong
in
many
things
you
ve
praised
me
sir
for
truth
now
you
ll
learn
i
had
not
courage
to
be
rightly
true
i
once
began
to
tell
you
how
she
came
the
woman
and
you
stared
upon
the
floor
in
one
of
your
fixed
thoughts
which
put
me
out
for
that
day
after
some
one
spoke
of
me
so
wisely
and
of
you
so
tenderly
persuading
me
to
silence
for
your
sake
well
well
it
seems
this
moment
i
was
wrong
in
keeping
back
from
telling
you
the
truth
there
might
be
truth
betwixt
us
two
at
least
if
nothing
else
and
yet
twas
dangerous
suppose
a
real
angel
came
from
heaven
to
live
with
men
and
women
he
d
go
mad
if
no
considerate
hand
should
tie
a
blind
across
his
piercing
eyes
tis
thus
with
you
you
see
us
too
much
in
your
heavenly
light
i
always
thought
so
angel
indeed
there
s
danger
that
you
beat
yourself
to
death
against
the
edges
of
this
alien
world
in
some
divine
and
fluttering
pity
yes
it
would
be
dreadful
for
a
friend
of
yours
to
see
all
england
thrust
you
out
of
doors
and
mock
you
from
the
windows
you
might
say
or
think
that
s
worse
there
s
some
one
in
the
house
i
miss
and
love
dreadful
very
kind
i
pray
you
mark
was
lady
waldemar
she
came
to
see
me
nine
times
rather
so
beautiful
she
hurts
me
like
the
day
let
suddenly
on
sick
eyes
most
kind
of
all
your
cousin
most
like
you
ere
you
came
she
kissed
me
mouth
to
mouth
i
felt
her
soul
dip
through
her
serious
lips
in
holy
fire
god
help
me
but
it
made
me
arrogant
i
almost
told
her
that
you
would
not
lose
by
taking
me
to
wife
though
ever
since
i
ve
pondered
much
a
certain
thing
she
asked
he
loves
you
marian
in
a
sort
of
mild
derisive
sadness
as
a
mother
asks
her
babe
you
ll
touch
that
star
you
think
farewell
i
know
i
never
touched
it
this
is
worst
babes
grow
and
lose
the
hope
of
things
above
a
silver
threepence
sets
them
leaping
but
no
more
stars
mark
that
i
ve
writ
all
night
and
told
you
nothing
god
if
i
could
die
and
let
this
letter
break
off
innocent
just
here
but
your
sake
here
s
the
last
i
never
could
be
happy
as
your
wife
i
never
could
be
harmless
as
your
friend
i
never
will
look
more
into
your
face
till
god
says
look
i
charge
you
seek
me
not
nor
vex
yourself
with
lamentable
thoughts
that
peradventure
i
have
come
to
grief
be
sure
i
m
well
i
m
merry
i
m
at
ease
but
such
a
long
way
long
way
long
way
off
i
think
you
ll
find
me
sooner
in
my
grave
and
that
s
my
choice
observe
for
what
remains
an
friend
will
care
for
me
and
keep
me
happy
happier
there
s
a
blot
this
ink
runs
thick
we
light
girls
lightly
weep
and
keep
me
happier
was
the
thing
to
say
than
as
your
wife
i
could
be
my
star
my
saint
my
soul
for
surely
you
re
my
soul
through
whom
god
touched
me
i
am
not
so
lost
i
can
not
thank
you
for
the
good
you
did
the
tears
you
stopped
which
fell
down
bitterly
like
times
you
made
me
weep
for
joy
at
hoping
i
should
learn
to
write
your
notes
and
save
the
tiring
of
your
eyes
at
night
and
most
for
that
sweet
thrice
you
kissed
my
lips
and
said
dear
twould
be
hard
to
read
this
letter
for
a
reader
half
as
learn
d
but
you
ll
be
sure
to
master
it
in
spite
of
ups
and
downs
my
hand
shakes
i
am
blind
i
m
poor
at
writing
at
the
best
yet
i
tried
to
make
my
the
way
you
showed
love
poor
marian
poor
marian
marian
it
so
or
so
for
days
her
touching
foolish
lines
we
mused
on
with
conjectural
fantasy
as
if
some
riddle
of
a
on
which
one
tries
unlike
similitudes
of
now
a
spotted
cast
off
and
now
a
screen
of
carven
ivory
that
shuts
the
heavens
conventual
secrets
up
from
mortals
we
sought
the
sense
she
loved
him
so
perhaps
such
words
mean
love
that
worked
on
by
some
shrewd
perfidious
tongue
and
then
i
thought
of
lady
waldemar
she
left
him
not
to
hurt
him
or
perhaps
she
loved
one
in
her
class
did
not
love
but
mused
upon
her
wild
bad
tramping
life
until
the
free
blood
fluttered
at
her
heart
and
black
bread
eaten
by
the
hedge
seemed
sweeter
than
being
put
to
romney
s
school
of
philanthropical
are
girls
beside
thought
i
and
like
a
wedding
by
one
rule
you
seldom
catch
these
birds
except
with
chaff
they
feel
it
almost
an
immoral
thing
to
go
out
and
be
married
in
broad
day
unless
some
winning
special
flattery
should
excuse
them
to
themselves
for
t
no
one
parts
her
hair
with
such
a
silver
line
as
you
one
moonbeam
from
the
forehead
to
the
crown
or
else
you
bite
your
lip
in
such
a
way
it
spoils
me
for
the
smiling
of
the
rest
and
so
on
then
a
worthless
gaud
or
two
to
keep
for
love
ribbon
for
the
neck
or
some
glass
pin
have
their
weight
with
girls
and
romney
sought
her
many
days
and
weeks
he
sifted
all
the
refuse
of
the
town
explored
the
trains
enquired
among
the
ships
and
felt
the
country
through
from
end
to
end
no
marian
i
hinted
what
i
knew
a
friend
of
his
had
reasons
of
her
own
for
throwing
back
the
would
not
hear
the
lady
had
been
ailing
ever
since
the
shock
had
harmed
her
something
in
his
tone
repressed
me
something
in
me
shamed
my
doubt
to
a
sigh
repressed
too
he
went
on
to
say
that
putting
questions
where
his
marian
lodged
he
found
she
had
received
for
visitors
besides
himself
and
lady
waldemar
and
that
once
dubious
woman
dressed
beyond
us
both
the
rings
upon
her
hands
had
dazed
the
children
when
she
threw
them
pence
she
wore
her
bonnet
as
the
queen
might
hers
to
show
the
crown
they
said
a
scarlet
crown
of
roses
that
had
never
been
in
when
romney
told
me
that
now
and
then
he
came
to
tell
me
how
the
search
advanced
his
voice
dropped
i
bent
forward
for
the
rest
the
woman
had
been
with
her
it
appeared
at
first
from
week
to
week
then
day
by
day
and
last
twas
sure
i
looked
upon
the
ground
to
escape
the
anguish
of
his
eyes
and
asked
as
low
as
when
you
speak
to
mourners
new
of
those
they
can
not
bear
yet
to
call
dead
if
marian
had
as
much
as
named
to
him
a
certain
rose
an
early
friend
of
hers
a
ruined
never
up
he
strode
from
side
to
side
about
the
room
most
like
some
prisoned
lion
sprung
awake
who
has
felt
the
desert
sting
him
through
his
dreams
what
was
i
to
her
that
she
should
tell
me
aught
a
friend
was
a
friend
i
see
all
clear
such
devils
would
pull
angels
out
of
heaven
provided
they
could
reach
them
tis
their
pride
and
that
s
the
odds
twixt
soul
and
the
veriest
slave
who
drops
in
cairo
s
street
cries
stand
off
from
me
to
the
passengers
while
these
blotched
souls
are
eager
to
infect
and
blow
their
bad
breath
in
a
sister
s
face
as
if
they
got
some
ease
by
i
broke
through
some
natures
catch
no
plagues
i
ve
read
of
babes
pound
whole
and
sleeping
by
the
spotted
breast
of
one
a
full
day
dead
i
hold
it
true
as
i
m
a
woman
and
know
womanhood
that
marian
erle
however
lured
from
place
deceived
in
way
keeps
pure
in
aim
and
heart
as
snow
that
s
drifted
from
the
to
the
open
twas
hard
to
hear
him
laugh
the
figure

happy
dozen
carts
and
trampers
will
secure
you
presently
a
fine
white
leave
it
there
your
snow
twill
pass
for
soot
ere
sunset
pure
in
aim
she
s
pure
in
aim
i
grant
you
myself
who
thought
to
take
the
world
upon
my
back
to
carry
it
o
er
a
chasm
of
social
ill
and
end
by
letting
slip
through
impotence
a
single
soul
a
child
s
weight
in
a
soul
straight
down
the
pit
of
hell
yes
i
and
she
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
our
pure

softly
as
the
last
repenting
drops
of
a
he
added
the
poor
child
poor
marian
twas
a
luckless
day
for
her
when
first
she
chanced
on
my
he
drew
a
chair
beside
me
and
sate
down
and
i
instinctively
as
women
use
before
a
sweet
friend
s
grief
in
his
ear
they
hum
the
tune
of
comfort
though
themselves
most
ignorant
of
the
special
words
of
such
and
quiet
so
and
fortify
his
brain
and
give
it
time
and
strength
for
feeling
out
to
reach
the
availing
sense
beyond
that
sound
went
murmuring
to
him
what
if
written
here
would
seem
not
much
yet
fetched
him
better
help
than
peradventure
if
it
had
been
more
i
ve
known
the
pregnant
thinkers
of
this
time
and
stood
by
breathless
hanging
on
their
lips
when
some
chromatic
sequence
of
fine
thought
in
learned
modulation
phrased
itself
to
an
unconjectured
harmony
of
truth
and
yet
i
ve
been
more
moved
more
raised
i
say
by
a
simple
word
a
broken
easy
thing
a
infant
might
say
after
you
a
look
a
sigh
a
touch
upon
the
palm
which
meant
less
than
i
love
you
than
by
all
the
rhetoric
of
those
ah
dear
aurora
he
began
at
last
his
pale
lips
fumbling
for
a
sort
of
smile
your
printer
s
devils
have
not
spoilt
your
heart
that
s
well
and
who
knows
but
long
years
ago
when
you
and
i
talked
you
were
somewhat
right
in
being
so
peevish
with
me
you
at
least
have
ruined
no
one
through
your
dreams
instead
you
ve
helped
the
facile
youth
to
live
youth
s
day
with
innocent
distraction
still
perhaps
suggestive
of
things
better
than
your
rhymes
the
little
eight
years
old
i
ve
seen
upon
the
mountains
of
vaucluse
asleep
i
the
sun
her
head
upon
her
knees
the
flocks
all
scattered
more
laudable
than
any
trained
imperfectly
who
bites
the
kids
through
too
much
i
look
as
if
i
had
slept
then
he
was
touched
at
once
by
something
in
my
face
indeed
twas
sure
that
he

of

of

up
in

ascending

pushes
toward
the

of
all
things
hungry
for

where
we
live

he
seemed
to
sift
me
with
his
painful
eyes
alas
you
take
it
gravely
you
refuse
your
dreamland
right
of

you

danced
the

even
thus
with

we
live
in
too
great
to

should
exert
a
double
vision
should
have
eyes
to
see

comprehensively
as
if
afar
they
took
their
point
of
sight
and

things
as

as
if

them
let
us
strive
for
this
i
do
distrust
the

who
discerns
no

in
his

trundles
back
his

whosoever

looks
just
to

he

he
will
not

and

an
swerving
of

may
outgrow
the

of

for

alas
i

into
if
o
sorrowful
great
gift
conferred
on
poets
of
a
twofold
life
when
one
life
has
been
found
enough
for
pain
we
staggering
neath
our
burden
as
mere
men
being
called
to
stand
up
straight
as
support
the
intolerable
strain
and
stress
of
the
universal
and
send
clearly
up
with
voices
broken
by
the
human
sob
our
poems
to
find
rhymes
among
the
stars
but
soft
poet
is
a
word
soon
said
a
book
s
a
thing
soon
written
nay
indeed
the
more
the
poet
shall
be
questionable
the
more
unquestionably
comes
his
book
and
this
of
granting
to
myself
some
passion
in
it
furrowing
up
the
flats
mere
passion
will
not
prove
a
volume
worth
its
gall
and
rags
even
bubbles
round
a
keel
mean
nought
excepting
that
the
vessel
moves
there
s
more
than
passion
goes
to
make
a
man
or
book
which
is
a
man
too
i
am
sad
i
wonder
if
pygmalion
had
these
doubts
and
feeling
the
hard
marble
first
relent
grow
supple
to
the
straining
of
his
arms
and
tingle
through
its
cold
to
his
burning
lip
supposed
his
senses
mocked
and
that
the
toil
of
stretching
past
the
known
and
seen
to
reach
the
archetypal
beauty
out
of
sight
had
made
his
heart
beat
fast
enough
for
two
and
with
his
own
life
dazed
and
blinded
him
not
so
pygmalion
loved
whoso
loves
believes
the
impossible
and
i
am
sad
i
can
not
thoroughly
love
a
work
of
mine
since
none
seems
worthy
of
my
thought
and
hope
more
highly
mated
he
has
shot
them
down
my
phœbus
apollo
soul
within
my
soul
who
judges
by
the
attempted
what
s
attained
and
with
the
silver
arrow
from
his
height
has
struck
down
all
my
works
before
my
face
while
said
nothing
is
there
aught
to
say
i
called
the
artist
but
a
greatened
man
he
may
be
childless
also
like
a
man
i
laboured
on
alone
the
wind
and
dust
and
sun
of
the
world
beat
blistering
in
my
face
and
hope
now
for
me
now
against
me
dragged
my
spirits
onward
some
fallen
balloon
which
whether
caught
by
blossoming
tree
or
bare
is
torn
alike
i
sometimes
touched
my
aim
or
seemed
generous
souls
cried
out
be
strong
take
courage
now
you
re
on
our
level
the
next
step
saves
you
i
was
flushed
with
praise
but
pausing
just
a
moment
to
draw
breath
i
could
not
choose
but
murmur
to
myself
is
this
all
all
that
s
done
and
all
that
s
gained
if
this
then
be
success
tis
dismaller
than
any
o
my
god
my
god
o
supreme
artist
who
as
sole
return
for
all
the
cosmic
wonder
of
thy
work
demandest
of
us
just
a
word
a
name
my
father
hast
knowledge
only
thou
how
dreary
tis
for
women
to
sit
still
on
winter
nights
by
solitary
fires
and
hear
the
nations
praising
them
far
off
too
far
ay
praising
our
quick
sense
of
love
our
very
heart
of
passionate
womanhood
which
could
not
beat
so
in
the
verse
without
being
present
also
in
the
unkissed
lips
and
eyes
undried
because
there
s
none
to
ask
the
reason
they
grew
moist
to
sit
alone
and
think
for
comfort
how
that
very
night
affianced
lovers
leaning
face
to
face
with
sweet
for
each
other
s
breath
are
reading
haply
from
some
page
of
ours
to
pause
with
a
thrill
as
if
their
cheeks
had
touched
when
such
a
stanza
level
to
their
mood
seems
floating
their
own
thought
so
i
feel
for
thee
and
i
for
thee
this
poet
knows
what
everlasting
love
is
that
night
a
father
issuing
from
the
misty
roads
upon
the
luminous
round
of
lamp
and
hearth
and
happy
children
having
caught
up
first
the
youngest
there
until
it
shrunk
and
shrieked
to
feel
the
cold
chin
prick
its
dimples
through
with
winter
from
the
hills
may
throw
i
the
lap
of
the
eldest
who
has
learnt
to
drop
her
lids
to
hide
some
sweetness
newer
than
last
year
s
our
book
and
cry
ah
you
you
care
for
rhymes
so
here
be
rhymes
to
pore
on
under
trees
when
april
comes
to
let
you
i
ve
been
told
they
are
not
idle
as
so
many
are
but
set
hearts
beating
pure
as
well
as
fast
it
s
yours
the
book
i
ll
write
your
name
in
it
that
so
you
may
not
lose
however
lost
in
poet
s
lore
and
charming
reverie
the
thought
of
how
your
father
thought
of
in
riding
from
the
to
have
our
books
appraised
by
love
associated
with
love
while
sit
loveless
is
it
hard
you
think
at
least
tis
mournful
fame
indeed
twas
said
means
simply
love
it
was
a
man
said
that
and
then
there
s
love
and
love
the
love
of
all
to
risk
in
turn
a
woman
s
paradox
is
but
a
small
thing
to
the
love
of
one
you
bid
a
hungry
child
be
satisfied
with
a
heritage
of
many
nay
he
says
he
s
hungry
would
rather
have
that
little
you
keep
from
him
while
reckoning
up
his
harvests
so
with
us
here
romney
too
we
fail
to
generalise
we
re
hungry
hungry
but
it
s
pitiful
to
wail
like
unweaned
babes
and
suck
our
thumbs
because
we
re
hungry
who
in
all
this
world
wherein
we
are
haply
set
to
pray
and
fast
and
learn
what
good
is
by
its
opposite
has
never
hungered
woe
to
him
who
has
found
the
meal
enough
if
ugolino
s
full
his
teeth
have
crunched
some
foul
unnatural
thing
for
here
satiety
proves
penury
more
utterly
irremediable
and
since
we
needs
must
hunger
for
man
s
love
than
god
s
truth
better
for
companions
sweet
than
great
convictions
let
us
bear
our
weights
preferring
dreary
hearths
to
desert
souls
well
well
they
say
we
re
envious
we
who
rhyme
but
i
because
i
am
a
woman
perhaps
and
so
rhyme
ill
am
ill
at
envying
i
never
envied
graham
his
breadth
of
style
which
gives
you
with
a
random
smutch
or
two
critics
analyse
to
smutch
such
delicate
perspectives
of
full
life
nor
belmore
for
the
unity
of
aim
to
which
he
cuts
his
cedarn
poems
fine
as
sketchers
do
their
pencils
nor
mark
gage
for
that
caressing
colour
and
trancing
tone
whereby
you
re
swept
away
and
melted
in
the
sensual
element
which
with
a
back
wave
restores
you
to
the
level
of
pure
souls
and
leaves
you
with
plotinus
none
of
these
for
native
gifts
or
popular
applause
i
ve
envied
but
for
this
when
by
chance
says
some
one
there
goes
belmore
a
great
man
he
leaves
clean
work
behind
him
and
requires
no
sweeper
up
of
the
chips
a
girl
i
know
who
answers
nothing
save
with
her
brown
eyes
smiles
unaware
as
if
a
guardian
saint
smiled
in
her
this
too
gage
comes
home
and
lays
his
last
book
s
prodigal
review
upon
his
mother
s
knees
where
years
ago
he
had
laid
his
childish
and
learned
to
chirp
and
peck
the
letters
from
her
mouth
as
young
birds
must
well
done
she
murmured
then
she
will
not
say
it
now
more
wonderingly
and
yet
the
last
well
done
will
touch
him
more
as
catching
up
and
yesterday
in
a
perfect
chord
of
love
and
so
mark
gage
i
envy
you
your
mother
you
graham
because
you
have
a
wife
who
loves
you
so
she
half
forgets
at
moments
to
be
proud
of
being
graham
s
wife
until
a
friend
observes
the
boy
here
has
his
father
s
massive
brow
done
small
in
wax
if
we
push
back
the
who
loves
dearest
father
sweet
i
speak
the
names
out
sometimes
by
myself
and
make
the
silence
shiver
they
sound
strange
as
hindostanee
to
an
man
accustomed
many
years
to
english
speech
or
lovely
grown
obsolete
which
will
not
leave
off
singing
up
in
heaven
i
have
my
father
my
mother
s
face
beside
him
in
a
blotch
of
heavenly
light
no
more
for
earth
s
familiar
household
use
no
more
the
best
verse
written
by
this
hand
can
never
reach
them
where
they
sit
to
seem
to
death
quite
unfellows
us
sets
dreadful
odds
betwixt
the
live
and
dead
and
makes
us
part
as
those
at
babel
did
through
sudden
ignorance
of
a
common
tongue
a
living
cæsar
would
not
dare
to
play
at
bowls
with
such
as
my
dead
father
is
and
yet
this
may
be
less
so
than
appears
this
change
and
separation
sparrows
five
for
just
two
farthings
and
god
cares
for
each
if
god
is
not
too
great
for
little
cares
is
any
creature
because
gone
to
god
i
ve
seen
some
men
veracious
nowise
mad
who
have
thought
or
dreamed
declared
and
testified
they
ve
heard
the
dead
like
a
clock
which
strikes
the
hours
of
the
eternities
beside
them
with
their
natural
ears
known
that
human
spirits
feel
the
human
way
and
hate
the
unreasoning
awe
which
waves
them
off
from
possible
communion
it
may
be
at
least
earth
separates
as
well
as
heaven
for
instance
i
have
not
seen
romney
leigh
full
eighteen
months
add
six
you
get
two
years
they
say
he
s
very
busy
with
good
works
has
parted
leigh
hall
into
almshouses
he
made
an
almshouse
of
his
heart
one
day
which
ever
since
is
loose
upon
the
latch
for
those
who
pull
the
never
did
it
always
makes
me
sad
to
go
abroad
and
now
i
m
sadder
that
i
went
among
the
lights
and
talkers
at
lord
howe
s
his
wife
is
gracious
with
her
glossy
braids
and
even
voice
and
gorgeous
eyeballs
calm
as
her
other
jewels
if
she
s
somewhat
cold
who
wonders
when
her
blood
has
stood
so
long
in
the
ducal
reservoir
she
calls
her
line
by
no
means
arrogantly
she
s
not
proud
not
prouder
than
the
swan
is
of
the
lake
he
has
always
swum
in
tis
her
element
and
so
she
takes
it
with
a
natural
grace
ignoring
tadpoles
she
just
knows
perhaps
there
men
move
on
without
outriders
which
isn
t
her
fault
ah
to
watch
her
face
when
good
lord
howe
expounds
his
theories
of
social
justice
and
tis
curious
what
a
tender
tolerant
bend
her
neck
takes
for
she
loves
him
likes
his
talk
such
clever
dear
odd
algernon
she
listens
on
exactly
as
if
he
talked
some
scandinavian
myth
of
lemures
too
pretty
to
dispute
and
too
absurd
she
s
gracious
to
me
as
her
husband
s
friend
and
would
be
gracious
were
i
not
a
leigh
being
used
to
smile
just
so
without
her
eyes
on
joseph
strangways
the

mesmerist
and
delia
dobbs
the
lecturer
from
the
states
upon
the
woman
s
then
for
him
i
like
him
he
s
my
friend
and
all
the
rooms
were
full
of
crinkling
silks
that
swept
about
the
fine
dust
of
most
subtle
courtesies
what
then
then
we
come
home
to
be
sad
how
lovely
one
i
love
not
looked
she
s
very
pretty
lady
waldemar
her
maid
must
use
both
hands
to
twist
that
coil
of
tresses
then
be
careful
lest
the
rich
bronze
rounds
should
slip
missed
though
a
grey
hair
a
single
one
saw
it
otherwise
the
woman
looked
immortal
how
they
told
those
alabaster
shoulders
and
bare
breasts
on
which
the
pearls
drowned
out
of
sight
in
milk
were
lost
excepting
for
the
they
split
the
amaranth
down
to
the
waist
or
nearly
with
the
audacious
press
of
beauty
if
the
heart
within
were
half
as
white
if
it
were
perhaps
the
breast
were
closer
covered
and
the
sight
less
aspectable
by
half
too
i
heard
the
young
man
with
the
german
student
s
a
sharp
face
like
a
knife
in
a
cleft
stick
which
shot
up
straight
against
the
parting
line
so
equally
dividing
the
long
hair
say
softly
to
his
neighbour
and
mediæval
look
that
way
sir
blaise
she
s
lady
the
left
whom
romney
leigh
our
ablest
man
just
now
is
soon
about
to
then
replied
sir
blaise
delorme
with
quiet
priestlike
voice
too
used
to
syllable
damnations
round
to
make
a
natural
emphasis
worth
while
is
leigh
your
ablest
man
the
same
i
think
once
jilted
by
a
recreant
pretty
maid
adopted
from
the
people
now
in
change
he
seems
to
have
plucked
a
flower
from
the
other
side
of
the
social
hedge
a
flower
a
flower
exclaimed
my
german
student
own
eyes
bent
on
her
he
was
twenty
certainly
sir
blaise
resumed
with
gentle
arrogance
as
if
he
had
dropped
his
alms
into
a
hat
and
had
the
right
to
counsel
my
young
friend
i
doubt
your
ablest
man
s
ability
to
get
the
least
good
or
help
meet
for
him
for
pagan
phalanstery
or
christian
home
from
such
a
flowery
creature
beautiful
my
student
murmured
rapt
mark
how
she
stirs
just
waves
her
head
as
if
a
flower
indeed
touched
far
off
by
the
vain
breath
of
our
at
which
that
bilious
grimwald
he
who
writes
for
the
renovator
who
had
seemed
absorbed
upon
the
of
autographs
i
dare
say
mentally
he
crunched
the
bones
of
all
those
writers
wishing
them
alive
to
feel
his
tooth
in
earnest
turned
short
round
with
low
carnivorous
laugh
a
flower
of
course
she
neither
sews
nor
spins
takes
no
thought
of
her
garments
falling
the
student
flinched
sir
blaise
the
same
then
both
drawing
back
their
chairs
as
if
they
spied
on
the
floor
pursued
their
talk
without
a
word
being
thrown
to
the
critic
good
sir
blaise
s
brow
is
high
and
noticeably
narrow
a
strong
wind
you
fancy
might
unroof
him
suddenly
and
blow
that
great
top
attic
off
his
head
so
piled
with
feudal
relics
you
admire
his
nose
in
profile
though
you
miss
his
chin
but
though
you
miss
his
chin
you
seldom
miss
his
golden
cross
worn
innermostly
carved
for
penance
by
a
saintly
styrian
monk
whose
flesh
was
too
much
with
him
slipping
through
some
unaware
unbuttoned
casualty
of
the

an
absent
air
sir
blaise
sate
fingering
it
and
speaking
low
while
i
upon
the
sofa
heard
it
all
my
dear
young
friend
if
we
could
bear
our
eyes
like
blessedest
lucy
on
a
plate
they
would
not
trick
us
into
choosing
wives
as
doublets
by
the
colour
otherwise
our
fathers
chose
therefore
when
they
had
hung
their
household
keys
about
a
lady
s
waist
the
sense
of
duty
gave
her
dignity
she
kept
her
bosom
holy
to
her
babes
and
if
a
moralist
reproved
her
dress
twas
too
much
starch
not
too
little
lawn
now
pshaw
returned
the
other
in
a
heat
a
little
fretted
by
being
called
young
friend
or
so
i
took
it
for
lucy
s
sake
if
she
s
the
saint
to
curse
by
let
us
leave
our
fathers
enough
about
our
sons
he
stroked
his
beardless
chin
yes
plagued
sir
plagued
the
future
generations
lie
on
us
as
heavy
as
the
nightmare
of
a
seer
our
meat
and
drink
grow
painful
prophecy
i
ask
you
we
leisure
if
we
liked
to
hollow
out
our
weary
hands
to
keep
your
intermittent
rushlight
of
the
past
from
draughts
in
lobbies
prejudice
of
sex
and
the
socket
drops
them
through
while
we
two
speak
may
protest
some
nostrils
like
your
own

odours
thence
you

sir
blaise
objected
if

said
with
fire
though
somewhat
less
so
than
i
seem

and

the

sir
sir
blaise
replied
i
plucked
a
silver
hair
this
morning
from
my
beard
which
left
me
your
inferior
would
i
were
eighteen
and
worthy
to
admonish
you
if
young
men
of
your
order
run
before
to
see
such
sights
as
sexual
prejudice
and
dissolved
plainer
words
a
general
concubinage
expressed
in
a
universal
pruriency

is
scarce
worth
running
fast
for
and
you

loitering

he
said
who
getting
to
the
top
of

talk
with

at

of
the

to
make
it
comprehensible
why
leigh

although
our
ablest

i
said
is
scarce
advanced
to

as
far
as
this
which
some
are
he
takes
up
imperfectly
the

the
rest
to
trail
a

socialist
is
romney
leigh
you
not
i
disbelieve
in
much
as
you
in
if
we
mix
two
colours
we
lose
both
and
make
a
third
distinct
from
either
mark
you
to
mistake
a
colour
is
the
sign
of
a
sick
brain
and
mine
i
thank
the
saints
is
clear
and
cool
a
neutral
tint
is
here
impossible
the
church
by
the
church
i
mean
of
course
the
catholic
apostolic
draws
lines
as
plain
and
straight
as
her
own
wall
inside
of
which
are
christians
obviously
and
outside
we
thank
you
well
i
know
the
ancient
would
fain
still
bite
for
all
her
toothless
gums
leigh
himself
would
fain
be
a
christian
still
for
all
his
wit
pass
that
you
two
may
settle
it
for
me
you
re
slow
in
england
in
a
month
i
learnt
at
göttingen
enough
philosophy
to
stock
your
english
schools
for
fifty
years
pass
that
too
here
alone
i
stop
you
short
a
true
man
like
leigh
could
stand
unequal
in
the
stature
of
his
life
to
the
height
of
his
opinions
choose
a
wife
because
of
a
smooth
skin
he
not
he
he
d
rail
at
venus
self
for
creaking
shoes
unless
she
walked
his
way
of
righteousness
and
if
he
takes
a
venus
meretrix
no
imputation
on
the
lady
there
be
sure
that
by
some
sleight
of
christian
art
he
has
metamorphosed
and
converted
her
to
a
blessed
soft
sir
blaise
drew
breath
as
if
it
hurt
him
soft
no
blasphemy
i
pray
you
the
first
christians
did
the
thing
why
not
the
last
asked
he
of
göttingen
with
just
that
shade
of
sneering
on
the
lip
compensates
for
the
lagging
of
the
beard
and
so
the
case
is
if
that
fairest
fair
is
talked
of
as
the
future
wife
of
leigh
she
s
talked
of
too
at
least
as
certainly
as
leigh
s
disciple
you
may
find
her
name
on
all
his
missions
and
commissions
schools
asylums
hospitals
has
had
her
down
with
other

whom
her

from

phalanstery
at

christianised
from

in
which
he
has
planted
out
his
sapling
stocks
of

into

and
there
they
say
she
has
tarried
half
a
week
and
milked
the
cows
and
churned
and
pressed
the
curd
and
said
my
sister
to
the
lowest
drab
of
all
the
assembled
castaways
such
girls
ay
sided
with
them
at
the

sir
blaise
those
naked
perfect
arms
round
glittering
arms
plunged
in
suds
like
wild
swans
hid
in
lilies
all
lord
howe
came
up
what
talking
poetry
so
near
the
image
of
the
unfavouring
muse
that
s
you
miss
leigh
i
ve
watched
you
half
an
hour
precisely
as
i
watched
the
statue
called
a
pallas
in
the
vatican
mind
the
face
sir
blaise
calm
and
sad
as
wisdom
cut
it
off
from
fellowship
but
spoke
louder
not
a
word
from
and
these
two
gentlemen
were
bold
i
marked
and
unabashed
by
even
your
ah
said
i
my
dear
lord
howe
you
shall
not
speak
to
a
printing
woman
who
has
lost
her
place
the
sweet
safe
corner
of
the
household
fire
behind
the
heads
of
children
compliments
as
if
she
were
a
woman
we
who
have
clipt
the
curls
before
our
eyes
may
see
at
least
as
plain
as
men
do
speak
out
man
to
man
no
compliments
beseech
friend
to
friend
let
that
be
we
are
sad
i
saw
night
sir
blaise
ah
has
slipped
away
i
saw
you
across
the
room
and
stayed
miss
leigh
to
keep
a
crowd
of
off
with
faces
toward
your
jungle
there
were
three
a
spacious
lady
five
feet
ten
and
fat
who
has
the
devil
in
her
and
there
s
room
for
walking
to
and
fro
upon
the
earth
from
chipewa
to
china
she
requires
your
autograph
upon
a
tinted
leaf
twixt
queen
pomare
s
and
emperor
soulouque
s
pray
give
it
she
has
energies
though
fat
for
me
i
d
rather
see
a
rick
on
fire
than
such
a
woman
angry
then
a
youth
fresh
from
the
backwoods
green
as
the
underboughs
asks
modestly
miss
leigh
to
kiss
your
shoe
and
adds
he
has
an
epic
in
twelve
parts
which
when
you
ve
read
you
ll
do
it
for
his
boot
all
which
i
saved
you
and
absorb
next
week
both
manuscript
and
man
a
lord
is
still
more
potent
than
a
poetess
with
any
extreme
republican
ah
ah
you
smile
at
last
thank
leave
the
smile
i
ll
lose
the
thanks
for
t
and
throw
you
in
my
transatlantic
girl
with
golden
eyes
that
draw
you
to
her
splendid
whiteness
as
the
pistil
of
a
draws
adust
with
gold
those
girls
across
the
sea
are
tyrannously
pretty
i
swore
she
seemed
to
me
an
innocent
frank
girl
to
bring
her
to
you
for
a
woman
s
kiss
not
now
but
on
some
other
day
or
week
ll
call
it
perjury
i
give
her
no
bring
now
said
he
you
make
it
hard
to
touch
such
goodness
with
a
grimy
palm
i
thought
to
tease
you
well
and
fret
you
cross
and
steel
myself
when
rightly
vexed
with
you
for
telling
you
a
thing
to
tease
you
of
romney
no
no
nothing
worse
he
cried
of
romney
leigh
than
what
is
buzzed
about
that
is
taken
in
an
too
like
many
half
as
wise
the
thing
i
mean
refers
to
you
not
refers
to
he
echoed
me
you
sound
it
like
a
stone
dropped
down
a
dry
well
very
listlessly
by
one
who
never
thinks
about
the
toad
alive
at
the
bottom
presently
perhaps
you
ll
sound
your
me
more
i
lord
howe
s
the
toad
then
in
this
question
brief
we
ll
take
it
graver
give
me
and
quiet
hearing
you
know
eglinton
john

of

he
answered
grave
a

an
excellent
landlord
of
the
olden
stamp
if
somewhat
slack
in
new
philanthropies
who
keeps
his
birthdays
with
a
tenants
dance
is
hard
upon
them
when
they
miss
the
church
or
keep
their
children
back
from
catechism
but
not
ungentle
when
the
aged
poor
pick
sticks
at
nay
i
ve
heard
him
say
the
old
dame
has
a
twinge
because
she
stoops
that

punishment
enough
for
o
landlord
may
i
take
my

him
when
the

arrives
for
gathering

obedient

he

indeed
i

heard
it
s
touching
dear
lord
howe
you
shall
not
praise
so
against
your
heart
when
i
m
at
worst
for
praise
and
be
less
bitter
with
me
for
in
short
he
said
i
have
a
letter
which
he
urged
me
so
to
bring
you
i
could
scarcely
choose
but
yield
insisting
that
a
new
love
passing
through
the
hand
of
an
old
friendship
caught
from
it
some
reconciling
love
you
say
my
lord
i
can
not
love
i
only
find
the
rhymes
for
love
that
s
not
love
my
lord
take
back
your
pause
you
ll
read
it
first
i
will
not
read
it
it
is
stereotyped
the
same
he
wrote
to

she
had
died
so
true

touched
the

itself
with
such

even
the

laid
softly
each

her
palms
and
sighed
for
joy

else
i
thank
your

aurora
leigh
some
indifferent
rhymes
like
those
the

round

chanced
perhaps
to

him

in

i

though
the

we
count
her

of

set
your

on
utterance

in
this

god
made
it
first
but
if
he

twas
so
long
since
and
since

spoiled
it
so
he
scarce

it
if
he

your
own
bread
painfully
or
ere
you
pour
our
wine
for
art
s
sake
i
answered
slow
some
wayfaring
man
who
feels
himself
at
night
too
far
from
home
makes
stedfast
face
against
the
bitter
wind
is
art
so
less
a
thing
than
virtue
is
that
artists
first
must
cater
for
their
ease
or
ever
they
make
issue
past
themselves
to
generous
use
alas
and
is
it
so
that
we
who
would
be
somewhat
clean
must
sweep
our
ways
as
well
as
walk
them
and
no
friend
confirm
us
nobly
leave
results
to
god
but
you
be
clean
what
prudent
compromise
makes
acceptable
life
you
say
instead
you
you
lord
howe
things
indifferent
well
for
instance
compromise
the
wheaten
bread
for
rye
the
meat
for
lentils
silk
for
serge
and
sleep
on
down
if
needs
for
sleep
on
straw
but
there
end
compromise
i
will
not
bate
one
on
straw
or
down
my
lord
nor
pinch
my
liberal
soul
though
i
be
poor
nor
cease
to
love
high
though
i
live
thus
so
speaking
with
less
anger
in
my
voice
than
sorrow
i
rose
quickly
to
depart
while
he
thrown
back
upon
the
noble
shame
of
such
natures
murmured
words
the
right
words
after
wrong
ones
ah
the
man
is
worthy
but
so
given
to
entertain
impossible
plans
of
superhuman
life
he
sets
his
virtues
on
so
raised
a
shelf
to
keep
them
at
the
grand
millennial
height
he
has
to
mount
a
stool
to
get
at
them
and
meantime
lives
on
quite
the
common
way
with
everybody
s
morals
as
we
passed
lord
howe
insisting
that
his
friendly
arm
should
oar
me
across
the
sparkling
brawling
stream
which
swept
from
room
to
room
fell
at
once
on
lady
waldemar
miss
leigh
she
said
and
gave
me
such
a
smile
so
cold
and
bright
as
if
she
tried
it
in
a
tiring
glass
and
liked
it
all
i
ve
strained
at
you
as
babes
at
baubles
held
up
out
of
reach
by
spiteful
nurses
never
snatch
they
say
and
there
you
sate
most
perfectly
shut
in
by
good
sir
blaise
and
clever
mister
smith
and
then
our
dear
lord
howe
at
last
indeed
i
almost
snatched
i
have
a
world
to
speak
about
your
cousin
s
place
in
shropshire
where
i
ve
been
to
see
his
work
our
work
heard
i
went
and
of
a
letter
yesterday
in
which
if
i
should
read
a
page
or
two
you
might
feel
interest
though
you
re
locked
of
course
in
literary
ll
like
to
hear
your
last
book
lies
at
the
phalanstery
as
judged
innocuous
for
the
elder
girls
and
younger
women
who
still
care
for
books
we
all
must
read
you
see
before
we
live
but
slowly
the
ineffable
light
comes
up
and
as
it
deepens
drowns
the
written
word
so
said
your
cousin
while
we
stood
and
felt
a
sunset
from
his
favourite
seat
he
might
have
been
a
poet
if
he
would
but
then
he
saw
the
higher
thing
at
once
and
climbed
to
it
i
think
he
looks
well
now
has
quite
got
over
that
unfortunate
ah
ah
i
know
it
moved
you
you
took
a
liking
to
the
wretched
girl
perhaps
you
thought
the
marriage
suitable
who
knows
a
poet
hankers
for
romance
and
so
on
as
for
romney
leigh
tis
sure
he
never
loved
her
by
the
way
you
have
not
heard
of
quite
out
of
sight
and
out
of
saving
lost
in
every
sense
she
might
have
gone
on
talking
and
i
stood
still
and
cold
and
pale
i
think
as
a
a
child
pelts
with
snow
for
pretty
pastime
every
now
and
then
i
put
in
yes
or
no
i
scarce
knew
why
the
blind
man
walks
wherever
the
dog
pulls
and
so
i
answered
till
lord
howe
broke
in
what
penance
takes
the
wretch
who
interrupts
the
talk
of
charming
women
i
at
last
must
brave
it
pardon
lady
waldemar
the
lady
on
my
arm
is
tired
unwell
and
loyally
i
ve
promised
she
shall
say
no
harder
word
this
evening
than
goodnight
the
rest
her
face
speaks
for
we
went
and
i
breathe
large
at
home
i
drop
my
cloak
unclasp
my
girdle
loose
the
band
that
ties
my
hair
now
could
i
but
unloose
my
soul
we
are
sepulchred
alive
in
this
close
world
and
want
more
room
the
charming
woman
this
reckoning
up
and
writing
down
her
talk
affects
me
singularly
how
she
talked
to
pain
me
woman
s
spite
wear
a
woman
takes
a
housewife
from
her
breast
and
plucks
the
delicatest
needle
out
as
twere
a
rose
and
pricks
you
carefully
neath
nails
neath
eyelids
in
your
nostrils
a
beast
would
roar
so
tortured
a
man
a
human
creature
must
not
shall
not
flinch
no
not
for
shame
what
vexes
after
all
is
just
that
such
as
she
with
such
as
i
knows
how
to
vex
sweet
heaven
she
takes
me
up
as
if
she
had
fingered
me
and
me
and
spelled
me
by
the
fireside
half
a
life
she
knows
my
turns
my
feeble
then
the
knowledge
of
a
thing
implies
the
thing
of
course
she
found
in
me
she
saw
her
pencil
underscored
for
a
fault
and
i
still
ignorant
shut
the
book
up
close
and
crush
that
beetle
in
the
leaves
o
heart
at
last
we
shall
grow
hard
too
like
the
rest
and
call
it
because
we
are
soft
and
after
all
now
why
should
i
be
pained
that
romney
leigh
my
cousin
should
espouse
this
lady
waldemar
and
say
she
held
her
gladness
in
my
face
twas
natural
surely
if
not
generous
considering
how
when
winter
held
her
fast
i
helped
the
frost
with
mine
and
pained
her
more
than
she
pains
me
pains
me
wherefore
pained
tis
clear
my
cousin
romney
wants
a
wife
so
good
man
s
need
of
the
woman
here
is
greater
than
the
woman
s
of
the
man
and
easier
served
for
where
the
man
discerns
a
sex
ah
ah
the
man
can
generalise
said
he
we
see
but
one
ideally
and
really
where
we
yearn
to
lose
ourselves
and
melt
like
white
pearls
in
another
s
wine
he
seeks
to
double
himself
by
what
he
loves
and
make
his
drink
more
costly
by
our
pearls
at
board
at
bed
at
work
and
holiday
it
is
not
good
for
man
to
be
alone
and
that
s
his
way
of
thinking
first
and
last
and
thus
my
cousin
romney
wants
a
wife
but
then
my
cousin
sets
his
dignity
on
personal
virtue
if
he
understands
by
love
like
others
it
is
that
he
may
verily
be
great
by
doing
rightly
and
kindly
once
he
thought
for
charitable
ends
set
duly
forth
in
heaven
s
white
to
marry
ah
we
ll
call
her
name
aurora
leigh
although
she
s
changed
since
then
once
for
social
ends
poor
marian
erle
my
sister
marian
erle
my
woodland
sister
sweet
maid
marian
whose
memory
moans
on
in
me
like
the
wind
through
casements
making
me
more
sad
than
ever
i
find
reasons
for
alas
poor
pretty
plaintive
face
embodied
ghost
he
finds
it
easy
then
to
clap
thee
off
from
pulling
at
his
sleeve
and
book
and
pen
he
locks
thee
out
at
night
into
the
cold
away
from
butting
with
thy
horny
eyes
against
his
crystal
dreams
now
he
s
strong
to
love
anew
that
lady
waldemar
succeeds
my
marian
after
all
why
not
he
loved
not
marian
more
than
once
he
loved
aurora
if
he
loves
at
last
that
third
albeit
she
prove
as
slippery
as
spilt
oil
on
marble
floors
i
will
not
augur
him
ill
luck
for
that
good
love
howe
er
is
better
for
a
man
s
soul
in
the
end
than
if
he
loved
ill
what
deserves
love
well
a
pagan
kissing
for
a
step
of
pan
the
s
on
the
loamy
down
exceeds
our
modern
thinker
who
turns
back
the
strata
granite
limestone
coal
and
clay
concluding
coldly
with
here
s
law
where
s
god
and
then
at
worse
romney
loves
her
not
at
worst
he
s
incapable
of
love
which
may
indeed
for
such
a
man
incapable
of
love
she
s
good
enough
for
she
at
worst
too
is
a
woman
still
and
loves
him
as
the
sort
of
woman
can
my
loose
long
hair
began
to
burn
and
creep
alive
to
the
very
ends
about
my
knees
i
swept
it
backward
as
the
wind
sweeps
flame
with
the
passion
of
my
hands
ah
romney
laughed
one
day
how
full
the
memories
come
up
florence
live
on
in
your
hair
he
said
it
gleams
well
i
wrung
them
out
my
made
a
knot
as
hard
as
life
of
those
loose
soft
impracticable
curls
and
then
sat
down
and
thought
she
shall
not
think
her
thought
of
me
drew
my
desk
and
wrote
dear
lady
waldemar
i
could
not
speak
with
people
round
me
nor
can
sleep
and
not
speak
after
the
great
news
i
heard
of
you
and
of
my
cousin
may
you
be
most
happy
and
the
good
he
meant
the
world
replenish
his
own
life
say
what
i
say
and
let
my
word
be
sweeter
for
your
mouth
as
you
are
i
only
aurora
that
s
quiet
guarded
though
she
hold
it
up
against
the
light
she
ll
not
see
through
it
more
than
lies
there
to
be
seen
so
much
for
pride
and
now
for
peace
a
little
let
me
stop
all
writing
back
sweet
thanks
my
sweetest
friend
you
ve
made
more
joyful
my
great
joy
itself
that
s
too
simple
she
would
twist
it
thus
my
joy
would
still
be
as
sweet
as
thyme
in
drawers
however
shut
up
in
the
dark
and
dry
but
violets
aired
and
dewed
by
love
like
yours
all
thyme
we
keep
that
in
our
clothes
but
drop
the
other
down
our
bosoms
till
they
smell
like
ah
i
see
her
writing
back
just
so
she
ll
make
a
nosegay
of
her
words
and
tie
it
with
blue
ribbons
at
the
end
to
suit
a
poet
and
then
we
ll
have
the
call
to
church
the
broken
sad
bad
dream
dreamed
out
at
last
the
complete
with
the
praying
in
white
gloves
drawn
off
in
haste
for
drinking
pagan
toasts
in
somewhat
stronger
wine
than
any
sipped
by
gods
since
bacchus
had
his
way
with
grapes
a
postscript
stops
all
that
and
rescues
me
you
need
not
write
i
have
been
overworked
and
think
of
leaving
london
england
even
and
hastening
to
get
nearer
to
the
sun
where
men
sleep
better
so
fold
and
seal
and
now
i
m
out
of
all
the
coil
i
breathe
now
i
spring
upward
like
a
branch
a
with
a
crooked
stick
may
pull
down
to
his
level
in
search
of
nuts
but
can
not
hold
a
moment
how
we
twang
back
on
the
blue
sky
and
assert
our
height
while
he
stares
after
now
the
wonder
seems
that
i
could
wrong
myself
by
such
a
doubt
we
poets
always
have
uneasy
hearts
because
our
hearts
as
the
globe
can
turn
but
one
side
to
the
sun
at
once
we
are
used
to
dip
our
in
gall
and
potash
trying
potentialities
of
alternated
colour
till
at
last
we
get
confused
and
wonder
for
our
skin
how
nature
tinged
it
first
s
the
true
good
i
recognise
my
hand
which
romney
leigh
may
clasp
as
just
a
friend
s
and
keep
his
clean
and
now
my
italy
alas
if
we
could
ride
with
naked
souls
and
make
no
noise
and
pay
no
price
at
all
i
would
have
seen
thee
sooner
italy
still
i
have
heard
thee
crying
through
my
life
thou
piercing
silence
of
extatic
graves
men
call
that
name
but
even
a
witch
must
melt
down
golden
pieces
in
the
nard
wherewith
to
anoint
her
broomstick
ere
she
rides
and
poets
evermore
are
scant
of
gold
and
if
they
find
a
piece
behind
the
door
it
turns
by
sunset
to
a
withered
leaf
the
devil
himself
scarce
trusts
his
patented
art
to
any
who
make
rhymes
but
culls
his
faustus
from
philosophers
and
not
from
poets
leave
my
job
said
god
and
so
the
devil
leaves
him
without
pence
and
poverty
proves
plainly
special
grace
in
these
new
just
administrative
times
men
clamour
for
an
order
of
merit
why
here
s
black
bread
on
the
table
and
no
wine
at
least
i
am
a
poet
in
being
poor
thank
god
i
wonder
if
the
manuscript
of
my
long
poem
if
twere
sold
outright
would
fetch
enough
to
buy
me
shoes
to
go
thrown
in
the
necessary
patch
for
the
other
side
the
alps
it
can
not
be
i
fear
that
i
must
sell
this
residue
of
my
father
s
books
although
the
elzevirs
have
by
his
hand
in
faded
notes
as
thick
and
fine
and
brown
as
cobwebs
on
a
tawny
monument
of
the
old
hæc
cum
and
so
on
in
the
scholar
s
regal
way
of
giving
judgment
on
the
parts
of
speech
as
if
he
sate
on
all
twelve
thrones
arraigning
israel
ay
but
books
and
notes
must
go
together
and
this
proclus
too
in
quaintly
dear
contracted
grecian
types
fantastically
crumpled
like
his
thoughts
which
would
not
seem
too
plain
you
go
round
twice
for
one
step
forward
then
you
take
it
back
because
you
re
somewhat
giddy
there
s
the
rule
for
proclus
ah
i
stained
this
middle
leaf
with
pressing
in
t
my
florence
long
stalk
and
all
my
father
chided
me
for
that
stain
of
blue
blood
recollect
the
peevish
turn
his
voice
took
silly
girls
who
plant
their
flowers
in
our
philosophy
to
make
it
fine
and
only
spoil
the
book
no
more
of
it
more
ah
blame
of
love
that
s
sweeter
than
all
praise
of
those
who
love
not
tis
so
lost
to
me
i
can
not
in
such
beggared
life
afford
to
lose
my
proclus
not
for
florence
even
the
kissing
judas
wolff
shall
go
instead
who
builds
us
such
a
royal
book
as
this
to
honour
a
and
writes
above
the
house
of
nobody
who
floats
in
cream
as
rich
as
any
sucked
from
juno
s
breasts
the
broad
homeric
lines
and
while
with
their
spondaic
prodigious
mouths
they
lap
the
lucent
margins
as
proclaims
them
bastards
wolff
s
an
atheist
and
if
the
iliad
fell
out
as
he
says
by
mere
fortuitous
concourse
of
old
songs
we
ll
guess
as
much
too
for
the
universe
that
wolff
those
platos
sweep
the
upper
shelves
as
clean
as
this
and
so
i
am
almost
rich
which
means
not
forced
to
think
of
being
poor
in
sight
of
ends
no
delay
i
ll
wait
in
paris
till
good
carrington
dispose
of
such
and
having
chaffered
for
my
book
s
price
with
the
publisher
direct
all
proceeds
to
me
just
a
line
to
ask
his
help
and
now
i
come
my
italy
my
own
hills
are
you
ware
of
me
my
hills
how
i
burn
toward
you
do
you
feel
the
urgency
and
yearning
of
my
soul
as
sleeping
mothers
feel
the
sucking
babe
and
smile
not
so
much
as
when
in
heat
vain
lightnings
catch
at
your
inviolate
tops
and
tremble
while
ye
are
stedfast
still
ye
go
your
own
determined
calm
indifferent
way
toward
sunrise
shade
by
shade
and
light
by
light
of
all
the
grand
progression
nought
left
out
as
if
god
verily
made
you
for
yourselves
and
would
not
interrupt
your
life
with
ours
sixth
book
the
english
have
a
scornful
insular
way
of
calling
the
french
light
the
levity
is
in
the
judgment
only
which
yet
stands
for
say
a
foolish
thing
but
oft
enough
and
here
s
the
secret
of
a
hundred
creeds
men
get
opinions
as
boys
learn
to
spell
by
chiefly
the
same
thing
shall
pass
at
last
for
absolutely
wise
and
not
with
fools
exclusively
and
so
we
say
the
french
are
light
as
if
we
said
the
cat
mews
or
the
gives
us
milk
say
rather
cats
are
milked
and
mew
for

light
that
dashes
from

the

winks

to
flatten
itself
to
a
wafer
on
the
white

on

a
hundred
paces
off
even
so
direct
so
sternly
undivertible
of

is
this
french
people
all
idealists
too
absolute
and
earnest
with
them
all
the
idea
of
a
knife
cuts
real
flesh
and
still
devouring
the
safe
interval
which
nature
placed
between
the
thought
and
act
with
those
too
fiery
and
impatient
souls
they
threaten
conflagration
to
the
world
and
rush
with
most
unscrupulous
logic
on
impossible
practice
set
your
orators
to
blow
upon
them
with
loud
windy
mouths
through
watchword
phrases
jest
or

which
drive
our
burley
brutal
english
mobs
like
so
much
chaff
whichever
way
they
blow
this
light
french
people
will
not
thus
be
driven
they
turn
indeed
but
then
they
turn
upon
some
central
pivot
of
their
thought
and
choice
and
veer
out
by
the
force
of
holding
fast
s
hard
to
understand
for
englishmen
unused
to
abstract
questions
and
untrained
to
trace
the
involutions
valve
by
valve
in

of

truth

fine
integument

fixed
in

incarnately
to
suit
our

of

and
reverence
the
special
form
with
us
being
still
the
thing
with
us
i
say
though
i
m
of
italy
by
mother
s
birth
and
grave
by
father
s
grave
and
memory
let
it
be
poet
s
heart
can
swell
to
a
pair
of
nationalities
however
in
a
woman
s
breast
and
so
i
am
strong
to
love
this
noble
france
this
poet
of
the
nations
who
dreams
on
and
wails
on
while
the
household
goes
to
wreck
for
ever
after
some
ideal
good
some
equal
poise
of
sex
some
unvowed
love
inviolate
some
spontaneous
brotherhood
some
wealth
that
leaves
none
poor
and
finds
none
tired
some
freedom
of
the
many
that
respects
the
wisdom
of
the
few
heroic
dreams
sublime
to
dream
so
natural
to
wake
and
sad
to
use
such
lofty
scaffoldings
erected
for
the
building
of
a
church
to
build
instead
a
brothel
or
a
may
god
save
france
however
she
have
sighed
her
great
soul
up
into
a
great
man
s
face
to
flush
his
temples
out
so
gloriously
that
few
dare
carp
at
cæsar
for
being
bald
what
then
cæsar
represents
not
reigns
and
is
no
despot
though
twice
absolute
this
head
has
all
the
people
for
a
heart
this
purple
s
lined
with
the
democracy
now
let
him
see
to
it
for
a
rent
within
must
leave
irreparable
rags
without
a
serious
riddle
find
such
anywhere
except
in
france
and
when
it
s
found
in
france
be
sure
to
read
it
rightly
so
i
mused
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
terraced
streets
the
glittering
boulevards
the
white
colonnades
of
fair
fantastic
paris
who
wears
boughs
like
plumes
as
if
man
made
them
up
her
fountains
in
the
sunshine
from
the
squares
as
dice
i
the
game
of
beauty
sure
to
win
or
as
she
blew
the
of
her
dreams
and
only
waited
for
their
falling
back
to
breathe
up
more
and
count
her
festive
hours
the
city
swims
in
verdure
beautiful
as
venice
on
the
waters
the
what
bosky
gardens
dropped
in
courts
as
plums
in
ladies
laps
who
start
and
laugh
what
miles
of
streets
that
run
on
after
trees
still
carrying
the
necessary
shops
those
open
caskets
with
the
jewels
seen
and
trade
is
art
and
art
s
philosophy
in
paris
there
s
a
silk
for
instance
there
as
worth
an
artist
s
study
for
the
folds
as
that
bronze
opposite
nay
the
bronze
has
faults
art
s
here
too
artful
as
a
maid
who
leans
to
mark
her
shadow
on
the
wall
until
she
lose
a
vantage
in
her
step
yet
art
walks
forward
and
knows
where
to
walk
the
artists
also
are
idealists
too
absolute
for
nature
logical
to
austerity
in
the
application
of
the
special
theory
not
a
soul
content
to
paint
a
crooked
pollard
and
an
ass
as
the
english
will
because
they
find
it
so
and
like
it
the
old
tuileries
is
pulling
its
high
cap
down
on
its
eyes
confounded
and
amazed
by
the
apparition
of
a
new
fair
face
in
those
devouring
mirrors
through
the
grate
within
the
gardens
what
a
heap
of
babes
swept
up
like
leaves
beneath
the
from
every
street
and
alley
of
the
town
by
the
ghosts
perhaps
that
blow
too
bleak
this
way
for
their
heads
dear
pretty
babes
i
ll
wish
them
luck
to
have
their
out
before
the
next
change
farther
on
what
statues
poised
upon
their
columns
fine
as
if
to
stand
a
moment
were
a
feat
against
that
blue
what
squares
what
for
a
nation
that
runs
fast
runs
against
the
dentist
s
teeth
at
the
corner
in
pale
rows
which
grin
at
progress
in
an
epigram
i
walked
the
day
out
listening
to
the
chink
of
the
first
napoleon
s
dry
bones
as
they
lay
in
his
second
grave
beneath
the
golden
dome
that
caps
all
paris
like
a
bubble
shall
these
dry
bones
live
thought
louis
philippe
once
and
lived
to
know
herein
is
argument
for
kings
and
politicians
but
still
more
for
poets
who
bear
buckets
to
the
well
of
ampler
draught
these
crowds
are
very
good
for
meditation
when
we
are
very
strong
though
love
of
beauty
makes
us
timorous
and
draws
us
backward
from
the
coarse
to
count
the
daisies
upon
dappled
fields
and
hear
the
streams
bleat
on
among
the
hills
in
innocent
and
indolent
repose
while
still
with
silken
elegiac
thoughts
we
wind
out
from
us
the
distracting
world
and
die
into
the
chrysalis
of
a
man
and
leave
the
best
that
may
to
come
of
us
in
some
brown
moth
be
rather
bold
and
bear
to
look
into
the
swarthiest
face
of
things
for
god
s
sake
who
has
made
them
seven
days
work
the
last
day

twixt
its
dawn
and

whole
work
bettered
of
the
previous
six
since

collected
and
resumed
in

and

at

the
sighs

while

to
shrink
back
from
her
warts
and
blains
we
will
not

she
sneezes
look
at
her
not
even
to
say

bless
her
that
s

wrong
for
that

not

us
often
with
her
larger
sense
of
beauty
and
desire
but
tethers
us
to
a

and
bids
us
diet
on

inside
left
ignorant
that
the
hungry
who
stares

and
wonders
at

both

and
surging

and

and
all
that
we
would
push
him
out
of
sight
in
order
to
see
nearer
let
us
pray
god
s
grace
to
keep
god
s
image
in
repute
that
so
the
poet
and
philanthropist
even
i
and
romney
may
stand
side
by
side
because
we
both
stand
face
to
face
with
men
contemplating
the
people
in
the
rough
yet
each
so
follow
a
vocation
and
mine
i
walked
on
musing
with
myself
on
life
and
art
and
whether
after
all
a
larger
metaphysics
might
not
help
our
physics
a
completer
poetry
adjust
our
daily
life
and
vulgar
wants
more
fully
than
the
special
outside
plans
phalansteries
material
institutes
the
civil
conscriptions
and
lay
monasteries
preferred
by
modern
thinkers
as
they
thought
the
bread
of
man
indeed
made
all
his
life
and
washing
seven
times
in
the
people
s
baths
were
sovereign
for
a
people
s
leprosy
still
leaving
out
the
essential
prophet
s
word
that
comes
in
power
on
which
we
thunder
down
we
prophets
poets
s
in
the
the
maker
burnt
the
darkness
up
with
his
to
inaugurate
the
use
of
vocal
life
and
plant
a
poet
s
word
even
deep
enough
in
any
man
s
breast
looking
presently
for
offshoots
you
have
done
more
for
the
man
than
if
you
dressed
him
in
a
coat
and
warmed
his
sunday
potage
at
your
fire
yet
romney
leaves
me
god
what
face
is
that
o
romney
o
marian
walking
on
the
quays
and
pulling
thoughts
to
pieces
leisurely
as
if
i
caught
at
grasses
in
a
field
and
bit
them
slow
between
my
absent
lips
and
shred
them
with
my
hands
what
face
is
that
what
a
face
what
a
look
what
a
likeness
full
on
mine
the
sudden
blow
of
it
came
down
till
all
my
blood
swam
my
eyes
dazzled
then
i
it
was
as
if
a
meditative
man
were
dreaming
out
a
summer
afternoon
and
watching
gnats
upon
a
pond
when
something
floats
up
suddenly
out
there
turns
over
a
dead
face
known
once
so
old
so
new
it
would
be
dreadful
now
to
lose
the
sight
and
keep
the
doubt
of
this
he
he
has
lost
it
in
the
splash
i
tore
the
crowd
up
either
side
and
rushed
on
forward
after
her
her
whom
a
woman
sauntered
slow
in
front
munching
an
apple
left
off
amazed
as
if
i
had
snatched
it
that
s
not
she
at
least
a
man
walked
with
a
lady
veiled
both
heads
dropped
closer
than
the
need
of
talk
they
started
he
forgot
her
with
his
face
and
she
herself
clung
to
him
as
if
my
look
were
fatal
such
a
stream
of
folk
and
all
with
cares
and
business
of
their
own
i
ran
the
whole
quay
down
against
their
eyes
no
marian
nowhere
marian
almost
now
i
could
call
marian
marian
with
the
shriek
of
desperate
creatures
calling
for
the
dead
where
is
she
was
she
was
she
anywhere
i
stood
still
breathless
gazing
straining
out
in
every
uncertain
distance
till
at
last
a
gentleman
abstracted
as
myself
came
full
against
me
then
resolved
the
clash
in
voluble
excuses
some
learned
member
of
the
institute
upon
his
way
there
walking
for
his
health
while
meditating
on
the
last
discourse
pinching
the
empty
air
twixt
finger
and
thumb
from
which
the
snuff
being
ousted
by
that
shock
defiled
his
waistcoat
duly
pricked
at
the
with
honourable
red
madame
your
pardon
he
swerved
from
me
a
metre
as
confounded
as
he
had
heard
that
dumas
would
be
chosen
to
fill
up
the
next
chair
vacant
by
his
men
since
when
was
genius
found
respectable
it
passes
in
its
place
indeed
means
the
seventh
floor
back
or
else
the
hospital
revolving
pistols
are
ingenious
things
but
prudent
men
academicians
are
scarce
keep
them
in
the
cupboard
next
the
prunes
and
so
abandoned
to
a
bitter
mirth
i
loitered
to
my
inn
o
world
o
world
o
jurists
rhymers
dreamers
what
you
please
we
play
a
weary
game
of
we
shape
a
figure
of
our
fantasy
call
nothing
something
and
run
after
it
and
lose
it
lose
ourselves
too
in
the
search
till
clash
against
us
comes
a
somebody
who
also
has
lost
something
and
is
lost
philosopher
against
philanthropist
academician
against
poet
man
against
woman
against
the
living
the
dead
then
home
with
a
bad
headache
and
worse
jest
to
change
the
water
for
my
heliotropes
and
yellow
roses
paris
has
such
flowers
but
england
also
twas
a
yellow
rose
by
that
south
window
of
the
little
house
my
cousin
romney
gathered
with
his
hand
on
all
my
birthdays
for
me
save
the
last
and
then
i
shook
the
tree
too
rough
too
rough
for
roses
to
stay
after
now
my
maps
i
must
not
linger
here
from
italy
till
the
last
nightingale
is
tired
of
song
and
the
last
dies
off
in
the
maize
my
soul
s
in
haste
to
leap
into
the
sun
and
scorch
and
seethe
itself
to
a
finer
mood
which
here
in
this
chill
north
is
apt
to
stand
too
stiffly
in
former
moulds
persists
it
floats
up
it
turns
over
in
my
mind
as
like
to
marian
as
one
dead
is
like
the
same
alive
in
very
deed
a
face
and
not
a
fancy
though
it
vanished
so
the
small
fair
face
between
the
darks
of
hair
i
used
to
liken
when
i
saw
her
first
to
a
point
of
moonlit
water
down
a
well
the
low
brow
the
frank
space
between
the
eyes
which
always
had
the
brown
pathetic
look
of
a
dumb
creature
who
had
been
beaten
once
and
never
since
was
easy
with
the
world
ah
i
remember
perfectly
those
eyes
overlarge
they
seemed
as
if
some
patient
passionate
despair
like
a
coal
dropt
and
forgot
on
tapestry
which
slowly
burns
a
widening
circle
out
had
burnt
them
larger
larger
and
those
eyes
i
do
remember
saw
me
too
as
i
saw
them
with
conscious
lids
astrain
in
recognition
now
a
fantasy
a
simple
shade
or
image
of
the
brain
is
merely
passive
does
not
is
seen
but
sees
not
twas
a
real
face
perhaps
a
real
marian
which
being
so
i
ought
to
write
to
romney
marian
s
here
be
comforted
for
my
pen
fell
my
hands
struck
sharp
together
as
hands
do
which
hold
at
nothing
can
i
write
to
a
half
truth
can
i
keep
my
own
soul
blind
to
the
other
half
the
worse
what
are
our
souls
if
still
to
run
on
straight
a
sober
pace
nor
start
at
every
pebble
or
dead
leaf
they
must
wear
blinkers
ignore
facts
suppress
six
tenths
of
the
road
confront
the
truth
my
soul
and
oh
as
truly
as
that
was
marian
s
face
the
arms
of
that
same
marian
clasped
a
thing
not
hid
so
well
beneath
the
scanty
shawl
i
can
not
name
it
now
for
what
it
was
a
child
small
business
has
a
like
marian
with
that
crown
of
prosperous
wives
at
which
the
gentlest
she
grows
arrogant
and
says
my
who
ll
find
an
emerald
ring
on
a
beggar
s
middle
finger
and
require
more
testimony
to
convict
a
thief
a
child
s
too
costly
for
so
mere
a
wretch
she
filched
it
somewhere
and
it
means
with
her
instead
of
honour
blessing
merely
shame
i
can
not
write
to
romney
here
she
is
here
s
marian
found
i
ll
set
you
on
her
track
i
saw
her
here
in
paris
and
her
child
she
put
away
your
love
two
years
ago
but
plainly
not
to
starve
you
suffered
then
and
now
that
you
ve
forgot
her
utterly
as
any
last
year
s
annual
in
whose
place
you
ve
planted
a
thick
flowering
evergreen
i
choose
being
kind
to
write
and
tell
you
this
to
make
you
wholly
s
not
dead
but
only
stop
there
i
go
too
fast
i
m
cruel
like
the
rest
haste
to
take
the
first
stir
in
the
arras
for
a
rat
and
set
my
barking
biting
thoughts
upon
t
child
what
then
suppose
a
neighbour
s
sick
and
asked
her
marian
carry
out
my
child
in
this
spring
air
punish
her
for
that
or
say
the
child
should
hold
her
round
the
neck
for
good
that
he
liked
it
so
and
would
not
leave
had
winning
i
brand
her
therefore
that
she
took
the
child
not
so
i
will
not
write
to
romney
leigh
for
now
he
s
happy
she
may
indeed
be
guilty
the
knowledge
of
her
fault
would
draggle
his
smooth
time
but
i
whose
days
are
not
so
fine
they
can
not
bear
the
rain
and
who
moreover
having
seen
her
face
must
see
it
again
see
it
by
my
hopes
of
one
day
seeing
heaven
too
the
police
shall
track
her
hound
her
ferret
their
own
soil
we
ll
dig
this
paris
to
its
catacombs
but
certainly
we
ll
find
her
have
her
out
and
save
her
if
she
will
or
will
or
no
child
a
child
then
one
to
save
the
long
weeks
passed
on
without
consequence
as
easy
find
a
footstep
on
the
sand
the
morning
after
as
the
trace
of
marian
s
feet
between
the
incessant
surfs
of
this
live
flood
she
may
have
moved
this
way
but
so
the
does
and
crosses
out
the
dent
of
her
small
shoe
the
foiled
police
renounced
me
could
they
find
a
girl
and
child
no
other
signalment
but
girl
and
child
no
data
shown
but
noticeable
eyes
and
hair
in
masses
low
upon
the
brow
as
if
it
were
an
iron
crown
and
pressed
friends
heighten
and
suppose
they
specify
why
girls
with
hair
and
eyes
are
everywhere
in
paris
they
had
turned
me
up
in
vain
no
marian
erle
indeed
but
certainly
mathildes
justines
victoires
or
if
i
sought
the
english
betsies
saras
by
the
score
they
might
as
well
go
out
into
the
fields
to
find
a
speckled
bean
that
s
somehow
specked
and
somewhere
in
the
left
me
so
shall
leave
marian
have
i
dreamed
a
dream
thank
god
i
have
found
her
i
must
say
thank
god
for
finding
her
although
tis
true
i
find
the
world
more
sad
and
wicked
for
t
but
i
ll
write
about
her
presently
my
hand
s
as
i
had
just
caught
up
my
heart
to
write
with
in
the
place
of
it
at
least
you
d
take
these
letters
to
be
writ
at
sea
in
storm
now
a
simple
chance
did
all
i
could
not
sleep
last
night
and
tired
of
turning
on
my
pillow
and
harder
thoughts
went
out
at
early
morning
when
the
air
is
delicate
with
some
last
starry
touch
to
wander
through
the
of
flowers
the
prettiest
haunt
in
paris
and
make
sure
at
worst
that
there
were
roses
in
the
world
so
wandering
musing
with
the
artist
s
eye
that
keeps
the
of
the
thing
it
loves
while
the
crowd
of
young
vivacious
and
heads
dipped
quick
as
finches
in
a
blossomed
tree
among
the
nosegays
cheapening
this
and
that
in
such
a
cheerful
twitter
of
rapid
speech
my
heart
leapt
in
me
startled
by
a
voice
that
slowly
faintly
with
long
breaths
that
marked
the
interval
between
the
wish
and
word
inquired
in
stranger
s
french
would
be
much
that
branch
of
flowering
so
much
too
much
for
me
then
turning
the
face
round
so
close
upon
me
that
i
felt
the
sigh
it
turned
with
marian
marian
to
marian
i
find
you
shall
i
let
you
go
i
held
her
two
slight
wrists
with
both
my
hands
ah
marian
marian
can
i
let
you
go
fluttered
from
me
like
a
cyclamen
as
white
which
taken
in
a
sudden
wind
beats
on
against
the
let
pass
she
said
at
last
i
will
not
i
replied
i
lost
my
sister
marian
many
days
and
sought
her
ever
in
my
walks
and
prayers
and
now
i
find
her
do
we
throw
away
the
bread
we
worked
and
prayed
for
it
and
drop
it
to
do
even
so
by
thee
whom
still
i
ve
hungered
after
more
than
bread
my
sister
marian
i
hurt
thee
dear
then
why
distrust
me
never
tremble
so
come
with
me
rather
where
we
ll
talk
and
live
and
none
shall
vex
us
i
ve
a
home
for
you
and
me
and
no
one
else
she
shook
her
head
a
home
for
you
and
me
and
no
one
else
one
of
us
i
prefer
to
such
a
roof
of
grass
on
which
a
flower
might
spring
less
costly
to
me
than
the
cheapest
here
and
yet
i
could
not
at
this
hour
afford
a
like
home
even
that
you
offer
yours
i
thank
you
you
are
good
as
heaven
as
good
as
one
i
knew
before
i
loosed
her
in
name
no
farewell
she
stood
as
if
i
held
her
for
his
sake
for
his
sake
romney
s
by
the
good
he
meant
ay
always
by
the
love
he
pressed
for
once
and
by
the
grief
reproach
abandonment
he
took
in
change
he
romney
who
grieved
who
had
the
heart
for
t
what
reproach
touched
be
merciful
therefore
come
i
answered
with
authority
i
think
we
dare
to
speak
such
things
and
name
such
names
in
the
open
squares
of
paris
not
a
word
she
said
but
in
a
gentle
humbled
way
as
one
who
had
forgot
herself
in
grief
turned
round
and
followed
closely
where
i
went
as
if
i
led
her
by
a
narrow
plank
across
devouring
waters
step
by
step
and
so
in
silence
we
walked
on
a
mile
and
then
she
stopped
her
face
was
white
as
wax
we
go
much
farther
you
are
ill
i
asked
or
tired
she
looked
the
whiter
for
her
smile
there
s
one
at
home
she
said
has
need
of
me
by
this
time
i
must
not
let
him
not
even
i
asked
to
hear
of
romney
leigh
not
even
she
said
to
hear
of
mister
in
that
case
i
resumed
i
go
with
you
and
we
can
talk
the
same
thing
there
as
here
none
waits
for
me
i
have
my
day
to
her
lips
moved
in
a
spasm
without
a
sound
but
then
she
spoke
it
shall
be
as
you
please
and
better
tis
shorter
seen
than
told
and
though
you
will
not
find
me
worth
your
pains
even
may
be
worth
some
pains
to
know
for
one
as
good
as
you
then
she
led
the
way
and
i
as
by
a
narrow
plank
across
devouring
waters
followed
her
stepping
by
her
footsteps
breathing
by
her
breath
and
holding
her
with
eyes
that
would
not
slip
and
so
without
a
word
we
walked
a
mile
and
so
another
mile
without
a
word
until
the
peopled
streets
being
all
dismissed
and
groups
all
scattered
like
a
flock
the
thickened
and
the
long
white
walls
beyond
like
spiders
outside
threads
stretched
feeling
blindly
toward
the
through
habitations
and
foundations
of
trenchant
chalk
that
bite
betwixt
the
grassy
uneven
turfs
where
goats
trailing
from
their
mouths
stood
perched
on
edges
of
the
cellarage
which
should
be
staring
as
about
to
leap
to
find
their
coming
bacchus
all
the
place
seemed
less
a
cultivation
than
a
waste
men
work
here
only
begin
to
live
all
s
sad
the
country
struggling
with
the
town
like
an
untamed
hawk
upon
a
strong
man
s
fist
that
beats
its
wings
and
tries
to
get
away
and
can
not
choose
be
satisfied
so
soon
to
hop
through
with
its
right
foot
tied
the
vintage
plains
and
pastoral
hills
in
sight
we
stopped
beside
a
house
too
high
and
slim
to
stand
there
by
itself
but
waiting
till
five
others
two
on
this
side
three
on
that
should
grow
up
from
the
sullen
second
floor
they
pause
at
now
to
build
it
to
a
row
the
upper
windows
partly
were
unglazed
meantime
meagre
unripe
house
a
line
of
rigid
poplars
elbowed
it
behind
and
just
in
front
beyond
the
lime
and
bricks
that
wronged
the
grass
between
it
and
the
road
a
great
acacia
with
its
slender
trunk
and
overpoise
of
multitudinous
leaves
in
which
a
hundred
fields
might
spill
their
dew
and
intense
verdure
yet
find
room
enough
stood
reconciling
all
the
place
with
green
i
followed
up
the
stair
upon
her
step
she
hurried
upward
shot
across
a
face
a
woman
s
on
the
landing
how
now
now
is
no
one
to
have
holidays
but
you
you
said
an
hour
and
stay
three
hours
i
think
and
julie
waiting
for
your
betters
here
why
if
he
had
waked
he
might
have
waked
for
murmuring
an
excusing
word
she
passed
and
shut
the
rest
out
with
the
myself
shut
in
beside
her
twas
a
room
scarce
larger
than
a
grave
and
near
as
bare
two
stools
a
i
saw
the
room
a
mouse
could
find
no
sort
of
shelter
in
t
much
less
a
greater
secret
curtainless
the
window
fixed
you
with
its
torturing
eye
defying
you
to
take
a
step
apart
if
peradventure
you
would
hide
a
thing
i
saw
the
whole
room
i
and
marian
there
alone
alone
she
threw
her
bonnet
off
then
sighing
as
twere
sighing
the
last
time
approached
the
bed
and
drew
a
shawl
away
you
could
not
peel
a
fruit
you
fear
to
bruise
more
calmly
and
more
carefully
than
so
nor
would
you
find
within
a
rosier
flushed
there
he
lay
upon
his
back
the
yearling
creature
warm
and
moist
with
life
to
the
bottom
of
his
dimples
the
ends
of
the
lovely
tumbled
curls
about
his
face
for
since
he
had
been
covered
to
keep
him
from
the
both
his
cheeks
were
hot
and
scarlet
as
the
first
live
rose
the
shepherd
s
ebbed
away
into
the
faster
for
his
love
and
love
was
here
as
instant
in
the
pretty
shut
close
as
if
for
dreaming
that
it
sucked
the
little
naked
feet
drawn
up
the
way
of
nestled
birdlings
everything
so
soft
and
tender
the
little
holdfast
hands
which
closing
on
a
finger
into
sleep
had
kept
the
mould
of
t
while
we
stood
there
dumb
for
oh
that
it
should
take
such
innocence
to
prove
just
guilt
i
thought
and
stood
there
dumb
the
light
upon
his
eyelids
pricked
them
wide
and
staring
out
at
us
with
all
their
blue
as
half
perplexed
between
the
angelhood
he
had
been
away
to
visit
in
his
sleep
and
our
most
mortal
presence
he
saw
his
mother
s
face
accepting
it
in
change
for
heaven
itself
with
such
a
smile
as
might
have
well
been
learnt
there
moved
but
smiled
on
in
a
drowse
of
ecstasy
so
happy
half
with
her
and
half
with
heaven
he
could
not
have
the
trouble
to
be
stirred
but
smiled
and
lay
there
like
a
rose
i
said
as
red
and
still
indeed
as
any
rose
that
blows
in
all
the
silence
of
its
leaves
content
in
blowing
to
fulfil
its
life
she
leaned
above
him
drinking
him
as
wine
in
that
extremity
of
love
twill
pass
for
agony
or
rapture
seeing
that
love
includes
the
whole
of
nature
rounding
it
to
love
no
more
more
can
never
be
than
just
love
cast
out
of
self
and
drowning
in
the
transport
of
the
sight
her
whole
pale
passionate
face
mouth
forehead
eyes
one
gaze
she
stood
then
slowly
as
he
smiled
she
smiled
too
slowly
smiling
unaware
and
drawing
from
his
countenance
to
hers
a
fainter
red
as
if
she
watched
a
flame
and
stood
in
it
how
beautiful
said
she
i
answered
trying
to
be
cold
must
sin
have
compensations
was
my
thought
as
if
it
were
a
holy
thing
like
grief
and
is
a
woman
to
be
fooled
aside
from
putting
vice
down
with
that
woman
s
toy
a
baby
ay
the
child
is
well
enough
i
answered
if
his
mother
s
palms
are
clean
they
need
be
glad
of
course
in
clasping
such
but
if
not
would
rather
lay
my
hand
were
i
she
god
s
brazen
with
burning
sacrificial
lambs
than
touch
the
sacred
curls
of
such
a
she
plunged
her
fingers
in
his
clustering
locks
as
one
who
would
not
be
afraid
of
fire
and
then
with
indrawn
steady
utterance
said
my
lamb
my
lamb
although
through
such
as
thou
the
most
unclean
got
courage
and
approach
to
god
once
they
can
not
even
with
men
find
grace
enough
for
pity
and
gentle
my
marian
i
made
answer
grave
and
sad
the
priest
who
stole
a
lamb
to
offer
him
was
still
a
thief
and
if
a
woman
steals
through
god
s
own
of
true
love
which
fence
out
licence
in
securing
love
a
child
like
this
that
smiles
so
in
her
face
she
is
no
mother
but
a
kidnapper
and
he
s
a
dismal
orphan
not
a
son
whom
all
her
kisses
can
not
feed
so
full
he
will
not
miss
hereafter
a
pure
home
to
live
in
a
pure
heart
to
lean
against
a
pure
good
mother
s
name
and
memory
to
hope
by
when
the
world
grows
thick
and
bad
and
he
feels
out
for
oh
she
smiled
with
bitter
patience
the
child
takes
his
chance
not
much
worse
off
in
being
fatherless
than
i
was
fathered
he
will
say
belike
his
mother
was
the
saddest
creature
born
he
ll
say
his
mother
lived
so
contrary
to
joy
that
even
the
kindest
seeing
her
grew
sometimes
almost
cruel
he
ll
not
say
she
flew
contrarious
in
the
face
of
god
with
of
her
vices
stole
my
child
my
flower
of
earth
my
only
flower
on
earth
my
sweet
ray
beauty
up
she
snatched
the
child
and
breaking
on
him
in
a
storm
of
tears
drew
out
her
long
sobs
from
their
shivering
roots
until
he
took
it
for
a
game
and
stretched
his
feet
and
flapped
his
eager
arms
like
wings
and
crowed
and
gurgled
through
his
infant
laugh
mine
mine
she
said
i
have
as
sure
a
right
as
any
glad
proud
mother
in
the
world
who
sets
her
darling
down
to
cut
his
teeth
upon
her
if
she
talks
of
law
i
talk
of
law
i
claim
my
by
law
law
which
now
is
paramount
the
common
law
by
which
the
poor
and
weak
are
trodden
underfoot
by
vicious
men
and
loathed
for
ever
after
by
the
good
let
pass
i
did
not
filch
i
found
the
you
found
him
marian
ay
i
found
him
where
i
found
my
curse
the
gutter
with
my
shame
what
have
you
any
of
you
to
say
to
that
who
all
are
happy
and
sit
safe
and
high
and
never
spoke
before
to
arraign
my
right
to
grief
itself
what
what
being
beaten
down
by
hoofs
of
maddened
oxen
into
a
ditch
whole
mangled
when
a
girl
at
last
breathes
sees
and
finds
there
bedded
in
her
flesh
because
of
the
overcoming
shock
perhaps
some
coin
of
price
and
when
a
good
man
comes
that
s
god
the
best
men
are
not
quite
as
good
and
says
i
dropped
the
coin
there
take
it
you
and
keep
it
shall
pay
you
for
the
loss
you
all
put
up
your
see
the
thief
observe
that
precious
thing
she
has
come
to
filch
how
bad
those
girls
are
oh
my
flower
my
pet
i
dare
forget
i
have
you
in
my
arms
and
fly
off
to
be
angry
with
the
world
and
fright
you
hurt
you
with
my
tempers
till
you
double
up
your
lip
ah
that
indeed
is
bad
a
naughty
mother
you
mistake
i
interrupted
if
i
loved
you
not
i
should
not
marian
certainly
be
alas
she
said
you
are
so
very
good
and
yet
i
wish
indeed
you
had
never
come
to
make
me
sob
until
i
vex
the
child
it
is
not
wholesome
for
these
to
be
so
early
watered
by
our
brine
and
then
who
knows
he
may
not
like
me
now
as
well
perhaps
as
ere
he
saw
me
fret
one
s
ugly
fretting
he
has
eyes
the
same
as
angels
but
he
can
not
see
as
deep
and
so
i
ve
kept
for
ever
in
his
sight
a
sort
of
smile
to
please
him
you
place
a
green
thing
from
the
garden
in
a
cup
to
make
believe
it
grows
there
look
my
sweet
my
we
ve
done
with
that
cross
face
and
here
s
the
face
come
back
you
used
to
like
ah
ah
he
laughs
he
likes
me
ah
miss
leigh
you
re
great
and
pure
but
were
you
purer
still
as
if
you
had
walked
we
ll
say
no
otherwhere
than
up
and
down
the
new
jerusalem
and
held
your
trailing
lutestring
up
yourself
from
brushing
the
twelve
stones
for
fear
of
some
small
speck
as
little
as
a
white
stitched
on
white
child
would
keep
to
would
choose
his
poor
lost
marian
like
me
best
and
though
you
stretched
your
arms
cry
back
and
cling
as
we
do
when
god
says
it
s
time
to
die
and
bids
us
go
up
higher
leave
us
then
we
two
are
happy
does
push
me
off
he
s
satisfied
with
me
as
i
with
so
soft
to
one
so
hard
to
others
nay
i
cried
more
angry
that
she
melted
me
we
make
henceforth
a
cushion
of
our
faults
to
sit
and
practise
easy
virtues
on
i
thought
a
child
was
given
to
sanctify
a
woman
her
in
the
sight
of
all
the
heavens
a
chosen
minister
to
do
their
business
and
lead
spirits
up
the
difficult
blue
heights
a
woman
lives
not
bettered
quickened
toward
the
truth
and
good
through
being
a
mother
then
she
s
none
although
she
damps
her
baby
s
cheeks
by
kissing
them
as
we
kill
kill
o
christ
she
said
and
turned
her
wild
sad
face
from
side
to
side
with
most
despairing
wonder
in
what
what
have
you
in
your
souls
against
me
then
all
of
you
am
i
wicked
do
you
think
god
knows
me
trusts
me
with
the
child
but
you
you
think
me
really
wicked
complaisant
i
answered
softly
to
a
wrong
you
ve
done
because
of
certain
profits
is
wrong
beyond
the
first
wrong
marian
when
you
left
the
pure
place
and
the
noble
heart
to
take
the
hand
of
a
seducer
whom
whose
hand
i
took
the
hand
of
springing
up
erect
and
lifting
up
the
child
at
full
arm
s
length
as
if
to
bear
him
like
an
oriflamme
unconquerable
to
armies
of
reproach
by
she
said
my
child
s
head
and
its
curls
by
those
blue
eyes
no
woman
born
could
dare
a
perjury
on
i
make
my
mother
s
oath
that
if
i
left
that
heart
to
lighten
it
the
blood
of
mine
was
still
except
for
grief
no
cleaner
maid
than
i
was
took
a
step
to
a
sadder
end
now
looks
backward
to
her
early
maidenhood
through
chaster
pulses
i
speak
steadily
and
if
i
lie
so
if
being
fouled
in
will
and
paltered
with
in
soul
by
devil
s
lust
i
dared
to
bid
this
angel
take
my
part
would
god
sit
quiet
let
us
think
in
heaven
nor
strike
me
dumb
with
thunder
yet
i
speak
he
clears
me
therefore
what
seduced
s
your
word
do
wolves
seduce
a
wandering
fawn
in
france
do
eagles
who
have
pinched
a
lamb
with
claws
seduce
it
into
carrion
so
with
me
i
was
not
ever
as
you
say
seduced
but
simply
there
she
paused
and
sighed
with
such
a
sigh
as
drops
from
agony
to
exhaustion
while
she
let
the
babe
slide
down
upon
her
bosom
from
her
arms
and
all
her
face
s
light
fell
after
him
like
a
torch
quenched
in
falling
down
she
sank
and
sate
upon
the
bedside
with
the
child
but
i
convicted
broken
utterly
with
woman
s
passion
clung
about
her
waist
and
kissed
her
hair
and
eyes
i
have
been
wrong
sweet
marian
weeping
in
a
tender
rage
sweet
holy
marian
and
now
marian
now
i
ll
use
your
oath
although
my
lips
are
hard
and
by
the
child
my
marian
by
the
child
i
ll
swear
his
mother
shall
be
innocent
before
my
conscience
as
in
the
open
book
of
him
who
reads
for
judgement
innocent
my
sister
let
the
night
be
ne
er
so
dark
the
moon
is
surely
somewhere
in
the
sky
so
surely
is
your
whiteness
to
be
found
through
all
dark
facts
but
pardon
pardon
me
and
smile
a
little
marian
the
child
if
not
for
me
my
the
poor
lip
just
motioned
for
the
smile
and
let
it
go
and
then
with
scarce
a
stirring
of
the
mouth
as
if
a
statue
spoke
that
could
not
breathe
but
spoke
on
calm
between
its
marble
lips
i
m
glad
i
m
very
glad
you
clear
me
so
i
should
be
sorry
that
you
set
me
down
with
harlots
or
with
even
a
better
name
which
misbecomes
his
mother
for
the
rest
i
am
not
on
a
level
with
your
love
nor
ever
was
you
know
now
am
worse
because
that
world
of
yours
has
dealt
with
me
as
when
the
hard
sea
bites
and
chews
a
stone
and
changes
the
first
form
of
it
i
ve
marked
a
shore
of
pebbles
bitten
to
one
shape
from
all
the
various
life
of
madrepores
and
so
that
little
stone
called
marian
erle
picked
up
and
dropped
by
you
and
another
friend
was
ground
and
tortured
by
the
incessant
sea
and
bruised
from
what
she
was
death
s
a
change
and
she
i
said
was
murdered
marian
s
dead
what
can
you
do
with
people
when
they
are
dead
but
if
you
are
pious
sing
a
hymn
and
go
or
if
you
are
tender
heave
a
sigh
and
go
but
go
by
all
means
permit
the
grass
to
keep
its
green
feud
up
twixt
them
and
you
then
leave
me
me
rest
i
m
dead
i
say
and
if
to
save
the
child
from
death
as
well
the
mother
in
me
has
survived
the
rest
why
that
s
god
s
miracle
you
must
not
tax
i
m
not
less
dead
for
that
i
m
nothing
more
but
just
a
mother
only
for
the
child
i
m
warm
and
cold
and
hungry
and
afraid
and
smell
the
flowers
a
little
and
see
the
sun
and
speak
still
and
am
silent
for
him
i
pray
you
therefore
to
mistake
me
not
and
treat
me
haply
as
i
were
alive
for
though
you
ran
a
pin
into
my
soul
i
think
it
would
not
hurt
nor
trouble
me
here
s
proof
dear
lady
the
but
now
you
promised
me
to
say
a
word
about
a
friend
who
once
long
years
ago
took
god
s
place
toward
me
when
he
draws
and
loves
and
does
not
thunder
whom
at
last
i
left
as
all
of
us
leave
god
you
thought
perhaps
i
seemed
to
care
for
hearing
of
that
friend
now
judge
me
we
have
sate
here
and
talked
together
of
the
child
and
me
and
i
not
asked
as
much
as
what
s
the
thing
you
had
to
tell
me
of
the
friend
the
friend
he
s
sad
i
think
you
said
s
sick
perhaps
it
s
nought
to
marian
if
he
s
sad
or
sick
another
would
have
crawled
beside
your
foot
and
prayed
your
words
out
why
a
beast
a
dog
a
starved
cat
if
he
had
fed
it
once
with
milk
would
show
less
hardness
but
i
m
dead
you
see
and
that
explains
poor
poor
thing
she
spoke
and
shook
her
head
as
white
and
calm
as
frost
on
days
too
cold
for
raining
any
more
but
still
with
such
a
face
so
much
alive
i
could
not
choose
but
take
it
on
my
arm
and
stroke
the
placid
patience
of
its
cheeks
then
told
my
story
out
of
romney
leigh
how
having
lost
her
sought
her
missed
her
still
he
for
himself
and
her
had
drawn
the
curtains
of
the
world
awhile
as
if
he
had
done
with
morning
there
i
stopped
for
when
she
gasped
and
pressed
me
with
her
eyes
and
now
how
is
it
with
him
tell
me
now
i
felt
the
shame
of
compensated
grief
and
chose
my
words
with
stepped
upon
the
slippery
stones
set
here
and
there
across
the
sliding
water
certainly
as
evening
empties
morning
into
night
another
morning
takes
the
evening
up
with
healthful
providential
interchange
and
though
he
thought
still
of
her
yes
she
knew
she
understood
she
had
supposed
indeed
that
as
one
stops
a
hole
upon
a
flute
at
which
a
new
note
comes
and
shapes
the
tune
excluding
her
would
bring
a
worthier
in
and
long
ere
this
that
lady
waldemar
he
loved
so
loved
i
started
loved
her
so
now
tell
me
i
will
tell
you
she
replied
but
since
we
re
taking
oaths
you
ll
promise
first
that
he
in
england
he
shall
never
learn
in
what
a
dreadful
trap
his
creature
here
round
whose
unworthy
neck
he
had
meant
to
tie
the
honourable
ribbon
of
his
name
fell
unaware
and
came
to
butchery
because
know
him
he
takes
to
heart
the
grief
of
every
stranger
he
s
not
like
to
banish
mine
as
far
as
i
should
choose
in
wishing
him
most
happy
now
he
leaves
to
think
of
me
perverse
who
went
my
way
unkind
and
left
him
if
once
he
knew
ah
then
the
sharp
nail
of
my
cruel
wrong
would
fasten
me
for
ever
in
his
sight
like
some
poor
curious
bird
through
each
spread
wing
nailed
high
up
over
a
fierce
hunter
s
fire
to
spoil
the
dinner
of
all
tenderer
folk
come
in
by
chance
nay
since
your
marian
s
dead
you
shall
not
hang
her
up
but
dig
a
hole
and
bury
her
in
silence
ring
no
i
answered
gaily
though
my
whole
voice
wept
we
ll
ring
the
not
the
because
we
have
her
back
dead
or
she
never
answered
that
but
shook
her
head
then
low
and
calm
as
one
who
safe
in
heaven
shall
tell
a
story
of
his
lower
life
unmoved
by
shame
or
anger
she
spoke
she
told
me
she
had
loved
upon
her
knees
as
others
pray
more
perfectly
absorbed
in
the
act
and
aspiration
she
felt
his
for
just
his
uses
not
her
own
at
all
his
stool
to
sit
on
or
put
up
his
foot
his
cup
to
fill
with
wine
or
vinegar
whichever
drink
might
please
him
at
the
chance
for
that
should
please
her
always
let
him
write
his
name
upon
her
it
seemed
natural
it
was
most
precious
standing
on
his
shelf
to
wait
until
he
chose
to
lift
his
hand
well
well
saw
her
then
and
must
have
seen
how
bright
her
life
went
floating
on
her
love
like
wicks
the
housewives
send
afloat
on
oil
which
feeds
them
to
a
flame
that
lasts
the
night
to
do
good
seemed
so
much
his
business
that
having
done
it
she
was
fain
to
think
must
fill
up
his
capacity
for
joy
at
first
she
never
mooted
with
herself
if
was
happy
since
he
made
her
so
or
if
loved
her
being
so
much
beloved
who
thinks
of
asking
if
the
sun
is
light
observing
that
it
lightens
who
s
so
bold
to
question
god
of
his
felicity
still
less
and
thus
she
took
for
granted
first
what
first
of
all
she
should
have
put
to
proof
and
sinned
against
him
so
but
only
so
what
could
you
hope
she
said
of
such
as
she
you
take
a
kid
you
like
and
turn
it
out
in
some
fair
garden
though
the
creature
s
fond
and
gentle
it
will
leap
upon
the
beds
and
break
your
tulips
bite
your
tender
trees
the
wonder
would
be
if
such
innocence
spoiled
less
a
garden
is
no
place
for
and
by
degrees
when
he
who
had
chosen
her
brought
in
his
courteous
and
benignant
friends
to
spend
their
goodness
on
her
which
she
took
so
very
gladly
as
a
part
of
his
by
slow
degrees
it
broke
on
her
slow
sense
that
she
too
in
that
eden
of
delight
was
out
of
place
and
like
the
silly
kid
still
did
most
mischief
where
she
meant
most
love
a
thought
enough
to
make
a
woman
mad
no
beast
in
this
but
she
may
well
go
mad
that
saying
i
am
thine
to
love
and
use
may
blow
the
plague
in
her
protesting
breath
to
the
very
man
for
whom
she
claims
to
die
that
clinging
round
his
neck
she
pulls
him
down
and
drowns
him
that
lavishing
her
soul
she
hales
perdition
on
him
so
being
mad
said
marian
stirred
such
thoughts
you
ask
whose
fault
it
was
that
she
should
have
such
thoughts
none
s
fault
none
s
fault
the
light
comes
and
we
see
but
if
it
were
not
truly
for
our
eyes
there
would
be
nothing
seen
for
all
the
light
and
so
with
marian
if
she
saw
at
last
the
sense
was
in
her
waldemar
had
spoken
all
in
vain
o
my
heart
o
prophet
in
my
heart
i
cried
aloud
then
lady
waldemar
spoke
she
speak
mused
marian
or
did
she
only
sign
or
did
she
put
a
word
into
her
face
and
look
and
so
impress
you
with
the
word
or
leave
it
in
the
foldings
of
her
gown
like
rosemary
smells
a
movement
will
shake
out
when
no
one
s
conscious
who
shall
say
or
guess
one
thing
alone
was
certain
the
day
the
gracious
lady
paid
a
visit
first
she
marian
saw
things
different
distrust
of
all
that
sheltering
roof
of
circumstance
her
hopes
were
building
into
with
clay
nests
her
heart
was
restless
pacing
up
and
down
and
fluttering
like
dumb
creatures
before
storms
not
knowing
wherefore
she
was
ill
at
and
still
the
lady
came
said
marian
erle
much
oftener
than
knew
it
mister
leigh
she
bade
me
never
tell
him
that
she
had
come
she
liked
to
love
me
better
than
he
knew
so
very
kind
was
lady
waldemar
and
every
time
she
brought
with
her
more
light
and
every
light
made
sorrow
clearer
well
ah
well
we
can
not
give
her
blame
for
that
twould
be
the
same
thing
if
an
angel
came
whose
right
should
prove
our
wrong
and
every
time
the
lady
came
she
looked
more
beautiful
and
spoke
more
like
a
flute
among
green
trees
until
at
last
as
one
whose
heart
being
sad
on
hearing
lovely
music
suddenly
dissolves
in
weeping
i
brake
out
in
tears
before
her
asked
her
counsel
had
i
erred
in
being
too
happy
would
she
set
me
straight
for
she
being
wise
and
good
and
born
above
the
flats
i
had
never
climbed
from
could
perceive
if
such
as
i
might
grow
upon
the
hills
and
whether
such
poor
herb
sufficed
to
grow
for
romney
leigh
to
break
his
fast
upon
t
or
would
he
pine
on
such
or
haply
starve
she
wrapt
me
in
her
generous
arms
at
once
and
let
me
dream
a
moment
how
it
feels
to
have
a
real
mother
like
some
girls
but
when
i
looked
her
face
was
younger
ay
youth
s
too
bright
not
to
be
a
little
hard
and
beauty
keeps
itself
still
uppermost
that
s
true
lady
waldemar
was
kind
she
hurt
me
hurt
as
if
the
should
smite
us
on
the
eyelids
when
we
sleep
and
wake
us
up
with
headache
ay
and
soon
was
light
enough
to
make
my
heart
ache
too
she
told
me
truths
i
asked
for
twas
my
fault
that
romney
could
not
love
me
if
he
would
as
men
call
loving
there
are
bloods
that
flow
together
like
some
rivers
and
not
mix
through
contraries
of
nature
he
indeed
was
set
to
wed
me
to
espouse
my
class
act
out
a
rash
opinion
once
wed
so
just
a
man
and
gentle
could
not
choose
but
make
my
life
as
smooth
as
bespeak
me
mildly
keep
me
a
cheerful
house
with
servants
broaches
all
the
flowers
i
liked
and
pretty
dresses
silk
the
whole
year
round
at
which
i
stopped
her
this
for
me
and
now
for
murmured
grew
difficult

himself

day
by
day
he
had
to
bend
his
height
to
pick
up
sympathies
opinions

and

the

talk
of
life

a

bursting
through
the
separating

of

dues
with
that

of
equal
love
keep
saying
so

it

s
i
asked
if
earnest
will
devoted
love
employed
in
youth
like
mine
would
fail
to
raise
me
up
as
two
strong
arms
will
always
raise

to
a
fruit

overhead

sighed
and
sighed
that
could
not
be

feared
you
take
a
pink
you
dig
about
its
roots
and
water
it
and
so
improve
it
to
a

will
not
change
it
to
a
heliotrope
the
kind
remains
and
then
the
harder
this
romney
leigh
so
rash
to
leap
a
pale
so
bold
for
conscience
quick
for
martyrdom
would
suffer
steadily
and
never
flinch
but
suffer
surely
and
keenly
when
his
class
turned
shoulder
on
him
for
a
shameful
match
and
set
him
up
as
in
their
talk
to
bowl
him
down
with
she
paused
and
when
i
used
the
pause
in
doubting
that
we
wronged
him
after
all
in
what
we
suppose
such
things
should
never
touch
him
more
in
his
high
conscience
if
the
things
should
be
than
when
the
queen
sits
in
an
upper
room
the
horses
in
the
street
can
spatter
her
a
moment
hope
came
the
lady
closed
that
door
and
nicked
the
lock
and
shut
it
out
observing
wisely
that
the
tender
heart
which
made
him
to
a
lower
class
could
scarcely
fail
to
make
him
sensitive
to
a
higher
they
thought
and
what
they
alas
alas
said
marian
rocking
slow
the
pretty
baby
who
was
near
asleep
the
eyelids
creeping
over
the
blue
balls
she
made
it
clear
too
saw
the
whole
and
yet
who
knows
if
i
had
seen
my
way
straight
out
of
it
by
looking
though
twas
clear
unless
the
generous
lady
ware
of
this
had
set
her
own
house
all
for
me
to
light
me
forwards
leaning
on
my
face
her
heavy
agate
eyes
which
crushed
my
will
she
told
me
tenderly
as
when
men
come
to
a
bedside
to
tell
people
they
must
die
she
knew
of
knowledge
of
knowledge
knew
that
romney
leigh
had
loved
formerly
and
loved
she
might
say
now
the
chance
was
past
but
that
of
course
he
never
guessed
for
something
came
between
them
something
thin
as
a
cobweb
catching
every
fly
of
doubt
to
hold
it
buzzing
at
the
and
help
to
dim
the
daylight
ah
man
s
pride
or
woman
is
greatest
most
averse
to
brushing
cobwebs
well
but
she
and
he
remained
fast
friends
it
seemed
not
more
than
so
because
he
had
bound
his
hands
and
could
not
stir
an
honourable
man
if
somewhat
rash
and
she
not
even
for
romney
would
she
spill
a
blot
as
little
even
as
a
tear
upon
his
to
gain
a
better
joy
for
two
than
came
by
that
for
though
i
stood
between
her
heart
and
heaven
she
loved
me
did
i
laugh
or
curse
i
think
i
sate
there
silent
hearing
all
ay
hearing
double
s
tale
at
once
and
romney
s
ll
keep
thee
which
means
that
is
it
time
for
church
now
lady
waldemar
spoke
more
continued
marian
but
as
when
a
soul
will
pass
out
through
the
sweetness
of
a
song
beyond
it
voyaging
the
uphill
road
even
so
mine
wandered
from
the
things
i
heard
to
those
i
suffered
it
was
afterward
i
shaped
the
resolution
to
the
act
for
many
hours
we
talked
what
need
to
talk
the
fate
was
clear
and
close
it
touched
my
eyes
but
still
the
generous
lady
tried
to
keep
the
case
afloat
and
would
not
let
it
go
and
argued
struggled
upon
marian
s
side
which
was
not
romney
s
though
she
little
knew
what
ugly
monster
would
take
up
the
end
what
griping
death
within
the
drowning
death
was
ready
to
complete
my
sum
of
i
thought
he
s
sliding
now
the
ring
upon
that
woman
s
finger
she
went
on
the
lady
failing
to
prevail
her
way
upgathered
my
torn
wishes
from
the
ground
and
pieced
them
with
her
strong
benevolence
and
as
i
thought
i
could
breathe
freer
air
away
from
england
going
without
pause
without
farewell
breaking
with
a
jerk
the
blossomed
offshoot
from
my
thorny
life
she
promised
kindly
to
provide
the
means
with
instant
passage
to
the
colonies
and
full
protection
would
commit
me
straight
to
one
who
once
had
been
her
and
had
the
customs
of
the
world
intent
on
changing
england
for
australia
herself
to
carry
out
her
fortune
for
which
i
thanked
the
lady
waldemar
as
men
upon
their
thank
last
friends
who
lay
the
pillow
straight
it
is
not
much
and
yet
tis
all
of
which
they
are
capable
this
lying
smoothly
in
a
bed
to
die
and
so
twas
fixed
so
from
day
to
day
the
woman
named
came
in
to
visit
just
then
the
girl
stopped
speaking
erect
and
stared
at
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
ghost
perhaps
i
looked
as
white
as
any
ghost
with
horror
does
god
make
she
said
all
sorts
of
creatures
really
do
you
think
or
is
it
that
the
devil
slavers
them
so
excellently
that
we
come
to
doubt
who
s
strongest
he
who
makes
or
he
who
mars
i
never
liked
the
woman
s
face
or
voice
or
ways
it
made
me
blush
to
look
at
her
it
made
me
tremble
if
she
touched
my
hand
and
when
she
spoke
a
fondling
word
i
shrank
as
if
one
hated
me
who
had
power
to
hurt
and
every
time
she
came
my
veins
ran
cold
as
somebody
were
walking
on
my
grave
at
last
i
spoke
to
lady
waldemar
could
such
an
one
be
good
to
trust
i
asked
whereat
the
lady
stroked
my
cheek
and
laughed
her
one
must
be
born
to
laugh
to
put
such
music
in
it
foolish
girl
your
scattered
wits
are
gathering
wool
beyond
the
reaches
the
thing
to
and
therefore
half
in
trust
and
half
in
scorn
that
i
had
heart
still
for
another
fear
in
such
a
safe
despair
i
left
the
thing
the
rest
is
short
i
was
obedient
i
wrote
my
letter
which
delivered
from
marian
to
his
own
prosperities
and
followed
that
bad
guide
the
lady
i
never
blame
the
lady
ladies
who
sit
high
however
willing
to
look
down
will
scarce
see
lower
than
their
dainty
feet
and
lady
waldemar
saw
less
than
i
with
what
a
devil
s
daughter
i
went
forth
the
swine
s
road
headlong
over
a
precipice
in
such
a
curl
of
caught
and
choked
no
shriek
of
soul
in
anguish
could
pierce
through
to
fetch
some
help
they
say
there
s
help
in
heaven
for
all
such
cries
but
if
one
cries
from
hell
what
then
heavens
are
deaf
upon
that
side
a
woman
hear
me
me
make
it
plain
a
woman
not
a
monster
both
her
breasts
made
right
to
suckle
babes
she
took
me
off
a
woman
also
young
and
ignorant
and
heavy
with
my
grief
my
two
poor
eyes
near
washed
away
with
weeping
till
the
trees
the
blessed
unaccustomed
trees
and
fields
ran
either
side
the
train
like
stranger
dogs
unworthy
of
any
notice
me
off
so
dull
so
blind
and
only
half
alive
not
seeing
by
what
road
nor
by
what
ship
nor
toward
what
place
nor
to
what
end
of
men
carry
a
corpse
thus
the
doorway
past
the
the
children
s
playground
up
the
green
lane
they
leave
it
in
the
pit
to
sleep
and
find
corruption
cheek
to
cheek
with
him
who
stinks
since
friday
but
suppose
to
go
down
with
one
s
soul
into
the
grave
to
go
down
half
dead
half
alive
i
say
and
wake
up
with
corruption
cheek
to
cheek
with
him
who
stinks
since
friday
there
it
is
and
that
s
the
horror
of
t
miss
leigh
you
feel
you
understand
do
not
look
at
me
but
understand
the
blank
blind
weary
way
which
led
where
er
it
led
away
at
least
the
shifted
ship
to
sydney
or
to
france
still
bound
wherever
else
to
another
land
the
swooning
sickness
on
the
dismal
sea
the
foreign
shore
the
shameful
house
the
night
the
feeble
blood
the
grief
no
need
to
bring
their
damnable
drugged
cup
and
yet
they
brought
it
hell

so
prodigal
of
devil
s
gifts

kill
no
poor

of
the

but
fifty
red
wide
throats
must
smoke
at
it
as
his
at
me

waking
up
at
last
i
told
you
that
i
waked
up
in
the
grave

so
is
plain
enough
so
true
we
wretches
can
not
tell
out
all
our
wrong
without
offence
to
decent
happy
folk
i
know
that
we
must
scrupulously
hint
with
delicate
reserves
the
thing
which
no
one
scrupled
we
should
feel
in
full

pass

only

my

me

i
am

lost
as
i
told
i
should
be
lost
when

fail
us

we
help
ourselves
that
s
fatal
you
call
it
being
lost
that
down
came
next
day
s
noon
and
caught
me
there
half
gibbering
and
half
raving
on
the
floor
and
wondering
what
had
happened
up
in
heaven
that
suns
should
dare
to
shine
when
god
himself
was
certainly
abolished
i
was
mad
how
many
weeks
i
know
not
weeks
i
think
they
let
me
go
when
i
was
mad
they
feared
my
eyes
and
loosed
me
as
boys
might
a
mad
dog
which
they
had
tortured
up
and
down
i
went
by
road
and
village
over
tracts
of
open
foreign
country
large
and
strange
crossed
everywhere
by
long
thin
like
fingers
of
some
ghastly
skeleton
hand
through
sunlight
and
through
moonlight
evermore
pushed
out
from
hell
itself
to
pluck
me
back
and
resolute
to
get
me
slow
and
sure
while
every
roadside
christ
upon
his
cross
hung
reddening
through
his
gory
wounds
at
me
and
shook
his
nails
in
anger
and
came
down
to
follow
a
mile
after
wading
up
the
low
vines
and
green
wheat
crying
take
the
girl
she
s
none
of
mine
from
henceforth
then
i
knew
but
this
is
somewhat
dimmer
than
the
rest
the
charitable
peasants
gave
me
bread
and
leave
to
sleep
in
straw
and

they
tied

round
my
how
heavy
it
seemed
as
heavy
as
a
stone
a
woman
has
been
strangled
with
less
weight
i
threw
it
in
a
ditch
to
keep
it
clean
and
ease
my
breath
a
little
when
none
looked
i
did
not
need
such
safeguards
men
stopped
short

when

my

so
i

passed
on
lived
twas
living
my
old
o
er
again
but
this
time
in
a
dream
and
hunted
round
by
some
prodigious
at
my
back
which
ended
yet
my
brain
cleared
presently
and
there
i
sate
one
evening
by
the
road
i
marian
erle
myself
alone
undone
facing
a
sunset
low
upon
the

as
if

were

of

upon

found

a

again

stood
as

as

having

through

stands
up
to
let

charge
him
with
another
pack
a
few

so
my
mistress
young
and
light
was
easy
with
me
less
for
kindness
than
because
she
led
herself
an
easy
time
betwixt

and

was

could

sometimes
as

to
tie
her

would
tap
me
softly
with

slender
foot
still
restless
with
the
last
night

dancing
in

and

vanished

of

came
an
hour
when
all
went
otherwise
she
did
not
speak
but
clenched
her

and
clipped
me
with
her

as
if
a
viper
with

of

far
for

of

the
way
with
these
light
women
of
a
thrifty
vice
my
marian
hard
upon
the
rent
in
any
sister
s
virtue
while
they
keep
their
chastity
so
darned
with
perfidy
that
though
a
rag
itself
it
looks
as
well
across
a
street
in
balcony
or
coach
as
any
stronger
stuff
might
for
my
part
i
d
rather
take
the
of
the
stews
than
touch
such
women
with
my
they
top
the
poor
by
their
lie
and
look
the
better
for
being
so
much
worse
the
devil
s
most
devilish
when
respectable
but
you
dear
and
your
all
the
rest
is
here
she
said
and
signed
upon
the
child
i
found
a
who
was
kind
and
let
me
sew
in
peace
among
her
girls
and
what
was
better
than
to
draw
the
threads
all
day
and
half
the
night
for
him
and
him
and
so
i
lived
for
him
and
so
he
lives
and
so
i
know
by
this
time
god
lives
she
smiled
beyond
the
sun
and
ended
so
and
all
my
soul
rose
up
to
take
her
part
against
the
world
s
successes
virtues
fames
come
with
me
sweetest
sister
i
returned
and
sit
within
my
house
and
do
me
good
from
henceforth
thou
and
thine
ye
are
my
own
from
henceforth
i
am
lonely
in
the
world
and
thou
art
lonely
and
the
child
is
half
an
orphan
come
henceforth
thou
and
i
being
still
together
will
not
miss
a
friend
nor
he
a
father
since
two
mothers
shall
make
that
up
to
him
i
am
journeying
south
and
in
my
tuscan
home
i
ll
find
a
niche
and
set
thee
there
my
saint
the
child
and
thee
and
burn
the
lights
of
love
before
thy
face
and
ever
at
thy
sweet
look
cross
myself
from
mixing
with
the
world
s
prosperities
that
so
in
gravity
and
holy
calm
we
two
may
live
on
toward
the
truer
she
looked
me
in
the
face
and
answered
not
nor
signed
she
was
unworthy
nor
gave
thanks
but
took
the
sleeping
child
and
held
it
out
to
meet
my
kiss
as
if
requiting
me
and
trusting
me
at
once
and
thus
at
once
i
carried
him
and
her
to
where
i
lived
she
s
there
now
in
the
little
room
asleep
i
hear
the
soft
through
the
door
and
all
three
of
us
at
s
break
pass
onward
homeward
to
our
italy
oh
romney
leigh
i
have
your
debts
to
pay
and
i
ll
be
just
and
pay
them
but
yourself
to
pay
your
debts
is
scarcely
difficult
to
buy
your
life
is
nearly
impossible
being
sold
away
to
lamia
my
head
aches
i
can
not
see
my
road
along
this
dark
nor
can
i
creep
and
grope
as
fits
the
dark
for
these
robes
of
womanhood
a
man
might
walk
a
little
but
i
loves
the
i
write
to
him
what
stops
his
marriage
and
destroys
his
peace
or
what
perhaps
shall
simply
trouble
him
until
she
only
need
to
touch
his
sleeve
with
just
a
finger
s
tremulous
white
flame
saying
ah
leigh
a
pretty
tale
a
very
pretty
poet
i
can
guess
the
motive
to
catch
his
eyes
in
hers
and
vow
she
does
not
wonder
they
two
to
break
in
laughter
as
the
sea
along
a
melancholy
coast
and
float
up
higher
in
such
a
laugh
their
fatal
weeds
of
love
ay
fatal
ay
and
who
shall
answer
me
fate
has
not
hurried
tides
and
if
my
letter
would
not
be
a
night
too
late
an
arrow
shot
into
a
man
that
s
dead
to
prove
a
vain
intention
would
i
show
the
new
wife
vile
to
make
the
husband
mad
no
lamia
shut
the
shutters
bar
the
doors
from
every
glimmer
on
thy
i
will
not
let
thy
hideous
secret
out
to
agonise
the
man
i
mean
the
friend
i
love
as
friends
love
it
is
strange
while
marian
told
her
story
like
to
absorb
most
listeners
how
i
listened
chief
to
a
voice
not
hers
nor
yet
that
enemy
s
nor
god
s
in
wrath
but
one
that
mixed
with
mine
long
years
ago
among
the
and
said
to
to
too
be
my
wife
aurora
it
is
strange
with
what
a
swell
of
yearning
passion
as
snow
of
ghosts
might
beat
against
the
impervious
doors
of
heaven
i
thought
now
if
i
had
been
a
woman
such
as
god
made
women
to
save
men
by
love
by
just
my
love
i
might
have
saved
this
man
and
made
a
nobler
poem
for
the
world
than
all
i
have
failed
but
i
failed
besides
in
this
and
now
he
s
lost
through
me
alone
and
by
my
only
fault
his
empty
house
sucks
in
at
this
same
hour
a
wind
from
hell
to
keep
his
hearth
cold
make
his
casements
creak
for
ever
to
the
tune
of
plague
and
o
romney
o
my
romney
o
my
friend
my
cousin
and
friend
my
helper
when
i
would
my
love
that
might
be
mine
why
how
one
weeps
when
one
s
too
weary
were
a
witness
by
he
d
say
some
folly
that
i
loved
the
man
who
knows
and
make
me
laugh
again
for
scorn
at
strongest
women
are
as
weak
in
flesh
as
men
at
weakest
vilest
are
in
soul
so
hard
for
women
to
keep
pace
with
men
as
well
give
up
at
once
sit
down
at
once
and
weep
as
i
do
tears
tears
we
weep
tis
worth
enquiry
we
ve
shamed
a
life
or
lost
a
love
or
missed
a
world
perhaps
by
no
means
simply
that
we
ve
walked
too
far
or
talked
too
much
or
felt
the
wind
i
the
east
and
so
we
weep
as
if
both
body
and
soul
broke
up
in
way
poor
mixed
rags
forsooth
we
re
made
of
like
those
other
dolls
that
lean
with
pretty
faces
into
fairs
it
seems
as
if
i
had
a
man
in
me
despising
such
a
woman
yet
indeed
to
see
a
wrong
or
suffering
moves
us
all
to
undo
it
though
we
should
undo
ourselves
ay
all
the
more
that
we
undo
ourselves
that
s
womanly
past
doubt
and
not
a
natural
movement
therefore
on
my
part
to
fill
the
chair
up
of
my
cousin
s
wife
and
save
him
from
a
devil
s
company
we
re
all
so
tis
our
woman
s
trade
to
suffer
torment
for
another
s
ease
the
world
s
male
chivalry
has
perished
out
but
women
are
to
the
last
and
if
cervantes
had
been
greater
still
he
had
made
his
don
a
donna
so
it
clears
and
so
we
rain
our
skies
blue
put
away
this
weakness
if
as
i
have
just
now
said
a
man
s
within
me
him
act
himself
ignoring
the
poor
conscious
trouble
of
blood
that
s
called
the
woman
merely
i
will
write
plain
words
to
england
too
late
too
late
if
then
accounted
ill
we
ll
trust
the
heavens
with
something
dear
lord
howe
you
ll
find
a
story
on
another
leaf
that
s
marian
erle
s
noble
friend
of
yours
she
trusted
once
through
what
flagitious
means
to
what
disastrous
ends

i
found
her
wandering
on
the
paris
quays
a
babe
upon
her
breast
unseasonable
outcast
on
such
snows
unthawed
to
this
time
i
will
tax
in
this
your
friendship
friend
that
convicted
she
be
not
his
wife
yet
to
denounce
the
facts
to
himself
otherwise
to
let
them

on
like

my

and
finds
her
home
with

a

which
good
news
she

help
to
make
him

him
for
my

gift
as
good
as
for

nerves
or
perfumed

for

aware
that
he
except
of
love
is
scarcely
sick
i
mean
the
new
love
this
time
since
last
year
such
quick
forgetting
on
the
part
of
men
is
any
shrewder
trick
upon
the
cards
to
enrich
them
pray
instruct
me
how
it
s
done
first

while
you
look
at
clubs
it
s
spades
that
s
prodigy
the
lightning
strikes
a
man
and
when
we
think
to
find
him
dead
and
charred
why
there
he
is
on
a
sudden
playing
pipes
beneath
the
splintered
crime
and
shame
and
all
their
hoggery
trample
your

nor
leave
more
than
apollo

kine
whose
hoofs
were

by
the
thieving
god

i
m
so
sad
so
weary
and
sad
i
m
somewhat
sour
forgive
me
to
be
blue
and
shrew
at
once
exceeds
all

except
yours
but
yours
i
know
is
infinite
farewell
we
take
train
for
italy
speak
gently
of
me
to
your
gracious
wife
as
one
however
far
shall
yet
be
near
in
loving
wishes
to
your
i
sign
and
now
i
ll
loose
my
heart
upon
a
page
lady
waldemar
i
m
very
glad
i
never
liked
you
which
you
knew
so
well
you
spared
me
in
your
turn
to
like
me
much
your
liking
surely
had
done
worse
for
me
than
has
your
loathing
though
the
last
appears
sufficiently
unscrupulous
to
hurt
and
not
afraid
of
judgment
now
there
s
space
between
our
faces
stand
off
as
if
i
judged
a
stranger
s
portrait
and
pronounced
indifferently
the
type
was
good
or
bad
what
matter
to
me
that
the
lines
are
false
i
ask
you
did
i
ever
ink
my
lips
by
drawing
your
name
through
them
as
a
friend
s
or
touch
your
hands
as
lovers
do
thank
god
i
never
did
and
since
you
re
proved
so
vile
ay
vile
i
say
ll
show
it
presently
i
m
not
obliged
to
nurse
my
friend
in
you
or
wash
out
my
own
blots
in
counting
yours
or
even
excuse
myself
to
honest
souls
who
seek
to
touch
my
lip
or
clasp
my
palm
alas
but
lady
waldemar
came
first
tis
true
by
this
time
you
may
near
me
so
that
you
re
my
cousin
s
wife
you
ve
gambled
deep
as
lucifer
and
won
the
in
that
case
the
noble
house
of
leigh
must
henceforth
with
its
good
roof
shelter
you
i
can
not
speak
and
burn
you
up
between
those
rafters
i
who
am
born
a
leigh
speak
and
pierce
your
breast
through
romney
s
i
who
live
his
friend
and
cousin
you
are
safe
you
two
must
grow
together
like
the
tares
and
wheat
till
god
s
great
make
the
best
of
time
and
hide
this
letter
let
it
speak
no
more
than
i
shall
how
you
tricked
poor
marian
erle
and
set
her
own
love
digging
her
own
grave
within
her
green
hope
s
pretty
ay
sent
her
forth
with
some
one
of
your
sort
to
a
wicked
house
in
france
which
she
fled
with
curses
in
her
eyes
and
ears
and
throat
her
whole
soul
choked
with
curses
in
short
and
madly
scouring
up
and
down
for
weeks
the
foreign
hedgeless
country
lone
and
lost
so
innocent
might
slink
within
remote
seeing
her
so
defiled
but
you
are
a
woman
and
more
bold
to
do
you
justice
you
d
not
shrink
to
face
we
ll
say
the
unfledged
life
in
the
other
room
which
treading
down
god
s
corn
you
trod
in
sight
of
all
the
dogs
in
reach
of
all
the
guns

poor
unfathered
child
her
yearling
babe

face
him
when
he
wakes
and
opens
up
his
wonderful
blue
eyes
you
d
meet
them
and
not
wink
perhaps
nor
fear
god
s
triumph
in
them
and
supreme
revenge
so
righting
his
creation

you
pulled
as
low
as
tophet
to
the
top
of
most
celestial
innocence
for
me
who
am
not
as
bold
i
own
those
infant
eyes
have
set
me
praying
while
they
look
at
heaven
no
need
of
protestation
in
my
words
against
the
place
you
ve
made
them
let
them
look
they
ll
do
your
business
with
the
heavens

sure
i
spare
you
common
curses

this
if
haply
you

romney

which
inheritance
beyond
your

you
sold

porridge
called

and
true
wife
keep
warm
his
hearth
and
clean
his
board
and
when
he
speaks
be
quick
with
your
obedience
still
grind
your
paltry
wants
and
low
desires
to
dust
beneath
his
heel
though
even
thus
the
ground
must
hurt
him

writ
of

ye
shall
not
yoke
together

but
you
shall
do
your
part
as
well
as
such

things
can

shall
not

him
you
shall

him

him

unlearn

a

scarcely

thee

as
softly
as

and
show
our

tormented
in

we
open
mouth
and
such
a
noise
will
follow
the
last
trump
s
will
scarcely
seem
more
dreadful
even
to
you
you
ll
have
no
pipers
after
romney
will
i
know
him
push
you
forth
as
none
of
his
all
other
men
declaring
it
well
done
while
women
even
the
worst
your
like
will
draw
their
skirts
back
not
to
brush
you
in
the
street
and
so
i
warn
you
i
m
aurora
the
letter
written
i
felt
satisfied
the
ashes
smouldering
in
me
were
thrown
out
by
handfuls
from
me
i
had
writ
my
heart
and
wept
my
tears
and
now
was
cool
and
calm
and
going
straightway
to
the
neighbouring
room
i
lifted
up
the
curtains
of
the
bed
where
marian
erle
the
babe
upon
her
arm
both
faces
leaned
together
like
a
pair
of
folded
innocences
each
smiling
from
the
other
smiled
and
slept
there
seemed
no
sin
no
shame
no
wrath
no
grief
i
felt
she
too
had
spoken
words
that
night
but
softer
certainly
and
said
to
god
who
laughs
in
heaven
perhaps
that
such
as
i
should
make
ado
for
such
as
defiled
i
wrote
defiled
i
thought
her
stoop
stoop
lower
aurora
get
the
angels
leave
to
creep
in
somewhere
humbly
on
your
knees
within
this
round
of
sequestration
white
in
which
they
have
wrapt
earth
s
foundlings
heaven
s
elect
the
next
day
we
took
train
to
italy
and
fled
on
southward
in
the
roar
of
steam
the
of
romney
must
be
loud
to
sound
so
clear
through
all
i
was
not
well
and
truly
though
the
truth
is
like
a
jest
i
could
not
choose
but
fancy
half
the
way
i
stood
alone
i
the
belfry
fifty
bells
of
naked
iron
mad
with
merriment
as
one
who
laughs
and
can
not
stop
himself
all
clanking
at
me
in
me
over
me
until
i
shrieked
a
shriek
i
could
not
hear
and
swooned
with
noise
still
along
my
swoon
was
ware
the
baffled
changes
backward
rang
prepared
at
each
emerging
sense
to
beat
and
crash
it
out
with
clangour
i
was
weak
i
struggled
for
the
posture
of
my
soul
in
upright
consciousness
of
place
and
time
but
evermore
twixt
waking
and
asleep
slipped
somehow
staggered
caught
at
marian
s
eyes
a
moment
it
is
very
good
for
strength
to
know
that
some
one
needs
you
to
be
strong
and
so
recovered
what
i
called
myself
for
that
time
i
just
knew
it
when
we
swept
above
the
old
roofs
of
dijon
lyons
dropped
a
spark
into
the
night
half
trodden
out
unseen
but
presently
the
winding
rhone
washed
out
the
moonlight
large
along
his
banks
which
strained
their
yielding
curves
out
clear
and
clean
to
hold
it
of
town
and
castle
blurred
upon
the
hurrying
river
such
an
air
blew
thence
upon
the
forehead
an
air
and
half
a
water
i
leaned
and
looked
then
turning
back
on
marian
smiled
to
mark
that
she
looked
only
on
her
child
who
slept
his
face
towards
the
moon
too
so
we
passed
the
liberal
open
country
and
the
close
and
shot
through
tunnels
like
a
by
great
driven
through
the
rock
which
quivering
through
the
intestine
blackness
splits
and
lets
it
in
at
once
the
train
swept
in
athrob
with
effort
trembling
with
resolve
the
fierce
denouncing
whistle
wailing
on
and
dying
off
smothered
in
the
shuddering
dark
while
we
drew
troubled
breath
oppressed
as
other
titans
underneath
the
pile
and
nightmare
of
the
mountains
out
at
last
to
catch
the
dawn
afloat
upon
the
land
slung
forth
broadly
and
gauntly
everywhere
not
crampt
in
their
foundations
pushing
wide
rich
outspreads
of
the
vineyards
and
the
corn
as
if
they
entertained
i
the
name
of
france
while
down
their
straining
sides
streamed
manifest
a
soil
as
red
as
charlemagne
s
knightly
blood
to
consecrate
the
verdure
some
one
said
marseilles
and
lo
the
city
of
marseilles
with
all
her
ships
behind
her
and
beyond
the
scimitar
of
sea
for
use
bared
blue
against
the
sky
that
night
we
spent
between
the
purple
heaven
and
purple
water
i
think
marian
slept
but
i
as
a
dog
for
his
master
s
foot
who
can
not
sleep
or
eat
before
he
hears
i
sate
upon
the
deck
and
watched
all
night
and
listened
through
the
stars
for
italy
those
i
spoke
of
sounded
far
as
some
child
s
in
the
street
beneath
to
a
dying
man
who
will
not
pass
the
day
and
knows
it
holding
by
a
hand
he
loves
i
too
sate
quiet
satisfied
with
death
sate
silent
i
could
hear
my
own
soul
speak
and
had
my
friend
nature
comes
sometimes
and
says
i
am
ambassador
for
i
felt
the
wind
soft
from
the
land
of
souls
the
old
miraculous
mountains
heaved
in
sight
one
straining
past
another
along
the
shore
the
way
of
grand
dull
odyssean
ghosts
athirst
to
drink
the
cool
blue
wine
of
seas
and
stare
on
voyagers
peak
pushing
peak
they
stood
i
watched
beyond
that
tyrian
belt
of
intense
sea
betwixt
them
and
the
ship
down
all
their
sides
the
misty
dissolving
in
the
weak
congenial
moon
and
still
disclosing
some
brown
that
seems
as
if
it
grew
from
some
brown
rock
or
many
a
little
lighted
village
dropt
like
a
fallen
star
upon
so
high
a
point
you
wonder
what
can
keep
it
in
its
place
from
sliding
headlong
with
the
waterfalls
which
drop
and
powder
all
the
with
spray
of
silver
thus
my
italy
was
stealing
on
us
genoa
broke
with
day
the
doria
s
long
pale
palace
striking
out
from
green
hills
in
advance
of
the
white
town
a
marble
finger
dominant
to
ships
seen
glimmering
through
the
uncertain
grey
of
dawn
but
then
i
did
not
think
my
italy
i
thought
my
father
o
my
father
s
house
without
his
presence
are
too
much
or
else
too
little
for
immortal
man
too
little
when
love
s
may
o
ergrows
the
ground
too
much
when
that
luxuriant
wealth
of
green
is
rustling
to
our
ankles
in
dead
leaves
tis
only
good
to
be
or
here
or
there
because
we
had
a
dream
on
such
a
stone
or
this
or
that
once
beings
wholly
waked
and
come
back
to
the
stone
without
the
dream
we
trip
upon
t
and
hurt
ourselves
or
else
it
falls
on
us
and
grinds
us
flat
the
heaviest
on
this
burying
earth
while
i
stood
and
mused
a
quiet
touch
fell
light
upon
my
arm
and
turning
round
a
pair
of
moistened
eyes
convicted
mine
what
marian
is
the
babe
astir
so
soon
he
sleeps
she
answered
i
have
crept
up
thrice
and
seen
you
sitting
standing
still
at
watch
i
thought
it
did
you
good
till
now
but
now
but
now
i
said
you
leave
the
child
and
alone
she
answered
she
looked
as
if
i
too
were
something
sweet
the
help
of
one
we
have
helped
thanks
marian
for
that
help
i
found
a
house
at
florence
on
the
hill
of
bellosguardo
tis
a
tower
that
keeps
a
post
of
o
er
the
valley
of
arno
holding
as
a
hand
the
outspread
city
straight
toward
fiesole
and
mount
morello
and
the
setting
sun
the
vallombrosan
mountains
to
the
right
which
sunrise
fills
as
full
as
crystal
cups
and
red
to
the
brim
because
it
s
red
no
sun
could
die
nor
yet
be
born
unseen
by
dwellers
at
my
villa
morn
and
eve
were
magnified
before
us
in
the
pure
illimitable
space
and
pause
of
sky
intense
as
angels
garments
blanched
with
god
less
blue
than
radiant
from
the
outer
wall
of
the
garden
dropped
the
mystic
floating
grey
of
with
interruptions
green
from
maize
and
vine
until
twas
caught
and
torn
on
that
abrupt
black
line
of
cypresses
which
signed
the
way
to
florence
beautiful
the
city
lay
along
the
ample
vale
cathedral
tower
and
palace
piazza
and
street
the
river
trailing
like
a
silver
cord
through
all
and
curling
loosely
both
before
and
after
over
the
whole
stretch
of
land
sown
whitely
up
and
down
its
opposite
slopes
with
farms
and
villas
many
weeks
had
passed
no
word
was
a
letter
came
from
vincent
carrington
my
dear
miss
leigh
you
ve
been
as
silent
as
a
poet
should
when
any
other
man
is
sure
to
speak
if
sick
if
vexed
if
dumb
a
will
split
a
man
s
tongue
he
speaks
and
says
received
that
but
you
i
send
you
funds
to
paris
and
you
make
no
sign
at
all
remember
i
m
responsible
and
wait
a
sign
of
you
miss
leigh
meantime
your
book
is
eloquent
as
if
you
were
not
dumb
and
common
critics
ordinarily
deaf
to
such
fine
meanings
and
like
deaf
men
loth
to
seem
deaf
answering
yes
or
no
it
must
be
or
it
must
not
most
pronounced
when
least
convinced
pronounce
for
once
aright
you
d
think
they
really
heard
so
they
do
the
burr
of
three
or
four
who
really
hear
and
praise
your
book
aright
fame
s
smallest
trump
is
a
great
for
the
deaf
as
posts
no
other
being
effective
fear
not
friend
we
think
here
you
have
written
a
good
book
and
you
a
woman
it
was
in
i
felt
twas
in
you
yet
i
doubted
half
if
that
of
german
reichenbach
which
still
from
female
burns
blue
could
strike
out
as
our
masculine
white
heats
to
quicken
a
man
forgive
me
all
my
heart
is
quick
with
yours
since
just
a
fortnight
since
i
read
your
book
and
loved
it
will
you
love
my
wife
too
here
s
my
secret
i
might
keep
a
month
more
from
you
but
i
yield
it
up
because
i
know
you
ll
write
the
sooner
for
t
most
women
of
your
height
even
counting
love
life
s
only
serious
business
who
s
my
wife
that
shall
be
in
a
month
you
ask
nor
guess
remember
what
a
pair
of
topaz
eyes
you
once
detected
turned
against
the
wall
that
morning
in
my
london
the
face
and
slurred
the
eyes
alone
but
you
you
caught
them
up
with
yours
and
said
kate
ward
s
eyes
i
own
the
truth
i
had
thrown
them
there
to
keep
them
safe
from
jove
they
would
so
naughtily
find
out
their
way
to
both
the
heads
of
both
my
danaës
where
just
it
made
me
mad
to
look
at
them
such
eyes
i
could
not
paint
or
think
of
eyes
but
those
so
i
flung
them
into
paint
and
turned
them
to
the
wall
s
care
ay
but
now
i
ve
let
them
out
my
kate
s
i
ve
painted
her
i
ll
change
my
style
and
leave
mythologies
the
whole
sweet
face
it
looks
upon
my
soul
like
a
face
on
water
to
beget
itself
a
portrait
in
a
hanging
cloak
like
one
you
wore
once
tis
a
little
frayed
i
pressed
too
for
the
nude
harmonious
but
she
she
d
have
her
way
and
have
her
cloak
she
said
she
could
be
like
you
only
so
and
would
not
miss
the
fortune
ah
my
friend
you
ll
write
and
say
she
shall
not
miss
your
love
through
meeting
mine
in
faith
she
would
not
change
she
has
your
books
by
heart
more
than
my
words
and
quotes
you
up
against
me
till
i
m
pushed
where
three
months
since
her
eyes
were
nay
in
fact
nought
satisfied
her
but
to
make
me
paint
your
last
book
folded
in
her
dimpled
hands
instead
of
my
brown
palette
as
i
wished
and
grant
me
the
presentment
had
been
newer
she
d
grant
me
nothing
i
ve
compounded
for
the
naming
of
the
next
month
and
gladly
too
tis
pretty
to
remark
how
women
can
love
women
of
your
sort
and
tie
their
hearts
with
to
your
feet
grow
insolent
about
you
against
men
and
put
us
down
by
putting
up
the
lip
as
if
a
man
such
let
us
own
who
write
not
ill
a
man
poor
wretch
while
write
far
worse
than
aurora
leigh
and
there
ll
be
women
who
believe
of
you
besides
my
kate
that
if
you
walked
on
sand
you
would
not
leave
a
are
you
put
to
wonder
by
my
marriage
like
poor
leigh
kate
ward
he
said
kate
ward
he
said
anew
i
thought
he
said
and
stopped
i
did
not
think
and
then
he
dropped
to
silence
ah
he
s
changed
i
had
not
seen
him
you
re
aware
for
long
but
went
of
course
i
have
not
touched
on
this
through
all
this
letter
of
your
heart
and
writing
lightlier
for
the
heavy
fact
as
clocks
are
voluble
with
lead
how
weak
to
say
i
m
sorry
dear
leigh
dearest
leigh
in
those
old
days
of
shropshire
me
when
he
and
you
fought
many
a
field
of
gold
on
what
you
should
do
or
you
should
not
do
make
bread
or
verses
it
just
came
to
that
i
thought
you
d
one
day
draw
a
silken
peace
through
a
golden
ring
i
thought
so
foolishly
the
event
proved
you
went
more
opposite
to
each
other
month
by
month
and
year
by
year
until
this
happened
god
knows
best
we
say
but
hoarsely
when
the
fever
took
him
first
just
after
i
had
writ
to
you
in
france
they
tell
me
lady
waldemar
mixed
drinks
and
counted
grains
like
any
salaried
nurse
excepting
that
she
wept
too
then
lord
howe
you
re
right
about
lord
howe
lord
howe
s
a
trump
and
yet
with
such
in
his
hand
a
man
like
leigh
may
lose
as
does
there
s
an
end
to
all
yes
even
this
letter
though
the
second
sheet
may
find
you
doubtful
write
a
word
for
kate
even
now
she
reads
my
letters
like
a
wife
and
if
she
sees
her
name
i
ll
see
her
smile
and
share
the
luck
so
bless
you
friend
of
two
i
will
not
ask
you
what
your
feeling
is
at
florence
with
my
pictures
i
can
hear
your
heart
over
the
and
just
to
pace
the
pitti
with
you
once
i
d
give
a
of
s
walk
with
kate
i
think
so
vincent
the
noon
was
hot
the
air
scorched
like
the
sun
and
was
shut
out
the
closed
persiani
threw
their
shadows
on
my
and
interlined
the
golden
atmosphere
straight
still
the
pictures
on
the
wall
the
statuette
on
the
console
of
young
love
and
psyche
made
one
marble
by
a
kiss
the
low
couch
where
i
leaned
the
table
near
the
vase
of
lilies
marian
pulled
last
night
each
green
leaf
and
each
white
leaf
ruled
in
black
as
if
for
writing
some
new
text
of
fate
and
the
open
letter
rested
on
my
knee
but
there
the
lines
swerved
trembled
though
i
sate
untroubled
plainly
reading
it
again
and
three
times
well
he
s
married
that
is
clear
no
wonder
that
he
s
married
nor
much
more
that
vincent
s
therefore
why
of
course
the
lady
nursed
him
when
he
was
not
well
mixed
drinks
nepenthe
was
the
drink
twas
scarce
worth
telling
but
a
man
in
love
will
see
the
whole
sex
in
his
mistress
hood
the
prettier
for
its
lining
of
fair
rose
although
he
catches
back
and
says
at
last
i
m
sorry
lady
waldemar
at
prettiest
under
the
said
hood
preserved
from
such
a
light
as
i
could
hold
to
her
face
to
flare
its
ugly
wrinkles
out
to
shame
is
scarce
a
wife
for
romney
as
friends
judge
aurora
leigh
or
vincent
carrington
that
s
plain
and
if
he
s
conscious
of
my
heart
perhaps
it
s
natural
though
the
phrase
is
strong
one
s
apt
to
use
strong
phrases
being
in
love
and
even
that
stuff
of
fields
of
gold
gold
rings
and
what
he
thought
poor
vincent
what
he
thought
may
never
mean
enough
to
ruffle
me
this
room
stifles
better
burn
than
choke
best
have
air
air
although
it
comes
with
fire
throw
open
blinds
and
windows
to
the
noon
and
take
a
blister
on
my
brow
instead
of
this
dead
weight
best
perfectly
be
stunned
by
those
insufferable
cicale
sick
and
hoarse
with
rapture
of
the
that
sing
like
poets
till
their
hearts
break
sing
till
men
say
it
s
too
books
succeed
and
lives
fail
do
i
feel
it
so
at
last
kate
loves
a
cloak
for
being
like
mine
while
i
live
for
being
myself
and
yearn
toward
some
one
else
who
yearns
away
from
what
he
is
in
his
turn
strain
a
step
for
ever
yet
gain
no
step
are
we
such
we
can
not
with
our
admirations
even
our
aspirations
touch
a
thing
that
s
higher
than
we
is
all
a
dismal
flat
and
god
alone
above
each
the
sun
o
er
level
lagunes
to
make
them
shine
and
stink
laying
stress
upon
us
with
immediate
flame
while
we
respond
with
our
miasmal
fog
and
call
it
mounting
higher
because
we
grow
more
highly
fatal
tush
aurora
leigh
you
wear
your
sackcloth
looped
in
cæsar
s
way
and
brag
your
failings
as
mankind
s
be
still
there
what
s
higher
in
this
very
world
than
you
can
live
or
catch
at
stand
aside
and
look
at
little
kate
she
ll
make
a
perfect
wife
for
carrington
she
always
has
been
looking
round
the
earth
for
something
good
and
green
to
alight
upon
and
nestle
into
with
those
eyes
subsiding
now
beneath
his
manly
hand
twixt
trembling
lids
of
inexpressive
joy
i
will
not
scorn
her
after
all
too
much
that
so
much
she
should
love
me
a
wise
man
can
pluck
a
leaf
and
find
a
lecture
in
t
and
i
too
god
has
made
me
ve
a
heart
that
s
capable
of
worship
love
and
loss
we
say
the
same
of
shakspeare
s
i
ll
be
meek
and
learn
to
reverence
even
this
poor
myself
the
book
it
a
good
book
says
he
and
you
a
i
had
laughed
at
that
but
long
since
i
m
a
woman
is
true
alas
and
woe
to
us
when
we
feel
it
most
then
least
care
have
we
for
the
crowns
and
goals
and
compliments
on
writing
our
good
books
the
book
has
some
truth
in
it
i
believe
and
truth
outlives
pain
as
the
soul
does
life
i
know
we
talk
our
phædons
to
the
end
through
all
the
dismal
faces
that
we
make
o
with
dishonouring
agony
from
any
mortal
drug
i
have
written
truth
and
i
a
woman
feebly
partially
inaptly
in
presentation
romney
ll
add
because
a
woman
for
the
truth
itself
that
s
neither
man
s
nor
woman
s
but
just
god
s
none
else
has
reason
to
be
proud
of
truth
himself
will
see
it
sifted
disenthralled
and
kept
upon
the
height
and
in
the
light
as
far
as
and
no
farther
than
tis
truth
for
he
has
left

very
good
he

it
still
of
truth
which
is
his
own
truth
so
far
in
my
book
truth
which
draws
through
all
things
upwards
that
a
twofold
world
must
go
to
a
perfect
cosmos
natural
things
and
spiritual
separates
those
two

up

verse
leads
vulgar
days
deals
ignorantly
with

is
wrong
in
short
at
all
points
we
divide
this
apple
of
life
and
cut
it
through
the
pips
the
perfect
round
which
fitted
venus

has
perished
utterly
as
if
we
ate
both
halves
without
the
spiritual
observe
the
natural
s
impossible
form
no
motion
without
sensuous
spiritual
is
inappreciable
beauty
or
power
and
in
this
twofold
sphere
the
twofold

and
still
the

is
intensely
a
man

firmly
by
the
natural
to
reach
the

beyond
it
still
the

to
pierce
through
with

immortal
to
the
antetype
some

to

so
presently
when

have
their

look
long
enough
on
any
peasant
s
face
here
coarse

you
ll
catch
antinous
somewhere
in
that
clay
as
as
he
yearns
at

from
marble
pale
with
beauty
then
persist
and
if
your
apprehension
s
competent
you
ll
find
some
fairer
angel
at

as
much
exceeding
him
as

the

pushing
him

ay
carrington
is
glad
of
such
a
creed
an
artist
must
who
paints
a
tree
a
leaf
a
common
stone
with
just
his
hand
and
finds
it
suddenly
with
and
conterminous
to
his
soul
why
else
do
these
things
move
him

the
bird

that
pecks
at

nor
yet
the

but
man
the

apprehends
the
manner
in
and
outwardly
and
nothing
in
the
world
comes
single
to
him
a
mere

or

all
patterns
of
what
shall
be
in

the
whole
temporal
show
related
royally
and
built
up
to
eterne
significance
through
the
open
arms
of
god
there
s
nothing
great
nor
small
has
said
a
poet
of
our
day
whose
voice
will
ring
beyond
the
curfew
of
eve
and
not
be
thrown
out
by
the
matin

and
truly
i

no
pebble
at

no

but
implies
the
cherubim
and
on
my
own
thin
veinéd
wrist
in
such
a
little
tremour
of
the

the
whole
strong
clamour
of
a
vehement
soul
doth
utter
itself

earth

crammed
with

and
every

only
he
who

off

sit
round

blackberries
and

their
natural

more
and
more
from
the
first
similitude
truth
so
far
in
my
book
a
truth
which
draws
from
all
things
upwards
i
aurora
still
have
felt
it
hound
me
through
the
wastes
of
life
as
jove
did
io
and
until
that
hand
shall
overtake
me
wholly
and
on
my
head
lay
down
its
large
unfluctuating
peace
the
feverish
pricks
me
up
and
down
it
must
be
art
s
the
witness
of
what
is
behind
this
show
if
this
world
s
show
were
all
then
imitation
would
be
all
in
art
there
jove
s
hand
gripes
us
we
stand
here
we
if
genuine
artists
witnessing
for
god
s
complete
consummate
undivided
work
not
a
natural
flower
can
grow
on
earth
without
a
flower
upon
the
spiritual
side
substantial
archetypal
all
with
blossoming
causes
so
far
away
that
we
whose
is
somewhat
cleared
may
not
catch
something
of
the
bloom
and
breath
too
vaguely
apprehended
though
indeed
still
apprehended
consciously
or
not
and
still
transferred
to
picture
music
verse
for
thrilling
audient
and
beholding
souls
by
signs
and
touches
which
are
known
to
souls
how
known
they
know
not
they
can
not
find
so
straight
call
out
on
genius
say
a
man
produced
this
much
rather
they
should
say
tis
insight
and
he
saw
thus
is
art
in
magnifying
a
truth
which
fully
recognised
would
change
the
world
and
shift
its
morals
if
a
man
could
feel
not
one
day
in
the
artist
s
ecstasy
but
every
day
feast
fast
or
the
spiritual
significance
burn
through
the
hieroglyphic
of
material
shows
henceforward
he
would
paint
the
globe
with
wings
and
reverence
fish
and
fowl
the
bull
the
tree
and
even
his
very
body
as
a
man
which
now
he
counts
so
vile
that
all
the
towns
make
offal
of
their
daughters
for
its
use
on
when
god
is
sad
in
heaven
to
think
what
goes
on
in
his
recreant
world
he
made
quite
other
while
that
moon
he
made
to
shine
there
at
the
first
love
s
covenant
shines
still
convictive
as
a
before
adulterous
eyes
how
sure
it
is
that
if
we
say
a
true
word
instantly
we
feel
tis
god
s
not
ours
and
pass
it
on
as
bread
at
sacrament
we
taste
and
pass
nor
handle
for
a
moment
as
indeed
we
dared
to
set
up
any
claim
to
such
and
poem
my
readers
talk
i
m
closer
to
can
speak
as
well
i
ll
say
with
romney
that
the
book
is
weak
the
range
uneven
the
points
of
sight
obscure
the
music
interrupted
let
us
go
the
end
of
woman
or
of
man
i
think
is
not
a
book
alas
the
best
of
books
is
but
a
word
in
art
which
soon
grows
cramped
stiff
with
the
weight
of
years
and
drops
an
accent
or
digamma
down
some
cranny
of
unfathomable
time
beyond
the
critic
s
reaching
art
itself
we
ve
called
the
higher
life
still
must
feel
the
soul
live
past
it
for
more
s
felt
than
is
perceived
and
more
s
perceived
than
can
be
interpreted
and
love
strikes
higher
with
his
lambent
flame
than
art
can
pile
the
faggots
is
it
so
when
jove
s
hand
meets
us
with
composing
touch
and
when
at
last
we
are
hushed
and
satisfied
then
io
does
not
call
it
truth
but
love
well
well
my
father
was
an
englishman
my
mother
s
blood
in
me
is
not
so
strong
that
i
should
bear
this
stress
of
tuscan
noon
and
keep
my
wits
the
town
there
seems
to
seethe
in
this
medæan
of
the
sun
and
all
the
patient
hills
are
bubbling
round
as
if
a
prick
would
leave
them
flat
does
heaven
keep
far
off
not
to
set
us
in
a
blaze
not
so
drag
your
fiery
fringes
heaven
and
burn
us
up
to
quiet
ah
we
know
too
much
here
not
to
know
what
s
best
for
peace
we
have
too
much
light
here
not
to
want
more
fire
to
purify
and
end
us
we
talk
talk
conclude
upon
divine
philosophies
and
get
the
thanks
of
men
for
hopeful
books
whereat
we
take
our
own
life
up
and
pshaw
unless
we
piece
it
with
another
s
life
a
yard
of
silk
to
carry
out
our
lawn
as
well
suppose
my
little
handkerchief
would
cover
samminiato

and
all
if
out
i
threw
it
past
the
cypresses
as
in
this
ragged
narrow
life
of
mine
contain
my
own
conclusions
but
at
least
we
ll
shut
up
the
persiani
and
sit
down
and
when
my
head
s
done
aching
in
the
cool
write
just
a
word
to
kate
and
carrington
may
joy
be
with
them
she
has
chosen
well
and
he
not
ill
i
should
be
glad
i
think
except
for
romney
had
married
kate
i
surely
surely
should
be
very
glad
this
florence
sits
upon
me
easily
with
native
air
and

my
graves
are

and

not
too
much

the
child
or
drags
him
up
the
hills
to
find
me
flowers
and
fill
those
vases
ere
i
m
quite
awake
the
grandiose
red
tulips
which
grow
wild
or
else
my
purple
lilies
dante
blew
to
a
larger
bubble
with
his
or
one
of
those
tall
flowering
reeds
which
stand
in
arno
like
a
sheaf
of
sceptres
left
by
some
remote
dynasty
of
dead
gods
to
suck
the
stream
for
ages
and
get
green
and
blossom
wheresoe
er
a
hand
divine
had
warmed
the
place
with
ichor
such
i
ve
found
at
early
morning
laid
across
my
bed
and
woke
up
pelted
with
a
childish
laugh
which
even
marian
s
low
precipitous
hush
had
vainly
interposed
to
put
away
while
i
with
shut
eyes
smile
and
motion
for
the
dewy
kiss
that
s
very
sure
to
come
from
mouth
and
cheeks
the
whole
child
s
face
at
once
dissolved
on
mine
if
a
nosegay
burst
its
string
with
the
weight
of
roses
overblown
and
dropt
upon
me
surely
i
should
be
glad
the
little
creature
almost
loves
me
now
and
calls
my
name
alola
stripping
off
the
like
thorns
to
make
it
smooth
enough
to
take
between
his
dainty
lips
god
love
him
i
should
certainly
be
glad
except
god
help
me
that
i
m
sorrowful
because
of
romney
romney
romney
well
this
grows
absurd
like
a
tune
that
runs
i
the
head
and
forces
all
things
in
the
world
wind
rain
the
creaking
gnat
or
stuttering
fly
to
sing
itself
and
vex
you
perhaps
a
paltry
tune
you
never
fairly
liked
some
i
d
be
a
butterfly
or
c
est
l
amour
we
re
made
so
such
tyrants
to
ourselves
we
are
not
slaves
to
nature
some
of
us
are
turned
too
overmuch
like
some
poor
verse
with
a
trick
of
ritournelle
the
same
thing
goes
and
comes
back
ever
vincent
carrington
is
sorry
and
i
m
sorry
but
s
strong
to
mount
from
sorrow
to
his
heaven
of
love
and
when
he
says
at
moments
poor
poor
leigh
who
ll
never
call
his
own
so
true
a
heart
so
fair
a
face
even
must
quickly
lose
the
pain
of
pity
in
the
blush
he
has
made
by
his
very
pitying
eyes
the
snow
for
him
has
fallen
in
may
and
finds
the
whole
earth
warm
and
melts
at
the
first
touch
of
the
green
grass
but
romney
has
chosen
after
all
i
think
he
had
as
excellent
a
sun
to
see
by
as
most
others
and
perhaps
has
scarce
seen
really
worse
than
some
of
us
when
all
s
said
let
him
pass
i
m
not
too
much
a
woman
not
to
be
a
man
for
once
and
bury
all
my
dead
like
alaric
depositing
the
treasures
of
my
soul
in
this
drained
and
letting
flow
the
river
of
life
again
with
and
full
of
silks
and
songs
blow
winds
and
help
us
ah
we
mock
ourselves
with
talking
of
the
winds
perhaps
as
much
with
other
resolutions
how
it
weighs
this
hot
sick
air
and
how
i
covet
here
the
dead
s
provision
on
the
river
s
couch
with
silver
curtains
drawn
on
tinkling
rings
or
else
their
rest
in
quiet
crypts
by
from
heat
and
noise
those
cicale
say
and
this
more
vexing
so
it
is
we
covet
for
the
soul
the
body
s
part
to
die
and
rot
even
so
aurora
ends
our
aspiration
who
bespoke
our
place
so
far
in
the
east
the
occidental
flats
had
fed
us
fatter
therefore
we
have
climbed
where
herbage
ends
we
want
the
beast
s
part
now
and
tire
of
the
angel
s
define
a
man
the
creature
who
stands
to
the
stars
the
creature
who
looks
inward
to
himself
the
laughing
creature
tis
enough
we
ll
say
instead
the
inconsequent
creature
man
for
that
s
his
specialty
what
creature
else
conceives
the
circle
and
then
walks
the
square
loves
things
proved
bad
and
leaves
a
thing
proved
good
you
think
the
bee
makes
honey
half
a
year
to
loathe
the
comb
in
winter
and
desire
the
little
ant
s
food
rather
but
a
note
men
are
but
women
after
all
as
women
are
but
auroras
are
men
born
tender
apt
to
pale
at
a
trodden
worm
who
paint
for
pastime
in
their
favourite
dream
spruce
flowered
with
there
are
too
who
believe
in
hell
and
lie
there
are
who
waste
their
souls
in
working
out
life
s
problem
on
these
sands
betwixt
two
tides
and
end
now
give
us
the
beast
s
part
in
alas
and
most
patient
god
thou
need
st
be
surelier
god
to
bear
with
us
than
even
to
have
made
us
thou
aspire
aspire
from
henceforth
for
me
thou
who
hast
thyself
endured
this
fleshhood
knowing
how
as
a
soaked
and
sucking
vesture
it
would
drag
us
down
and
choke
us
in
the
melancholy
deep
sustain
me
that
with
thee
i
walk
these
waves
resisting
me
upward
thou
for
me
aspiring
who
art
the
way
the
truth
the
life
that
no
truth
henceforth
seem
indifferent
no
way
to
truth
laborious
and
no
life
not
even
this
life
i
live
intolerable
the
days
went
by
i
took
up
the
old
days
with
all
their
tuscan
pleasures
worn
and
spoiled
like
some
lost
book
we
dropt
in
the
long
grass
on
such
a
happy
when
last
we
read
it
with
a
loving
friend
and
find
in
autumn
when
the
friend
is
gone
the
grass
cut
short
the
weather
changed
too
late
and
stare
at
as
at
something
wonderful
for
sorrow
how
two
hands
before
had
held
up
what
is
left
to
only
one
and
how
we
smiled
when
such
a
vehement
nail
impressed
the
tiny
dint
here
which
presents
this
verse
in
fire
for
ever
tenderly
and
mournfully
i
lived
i
knew
the
birds
and
insects
look
fathered
by
the
flowers
and
emulous
of
their
hues
i
recognised
the
moths
with
that
great
overpoise
of
wings
which
makes
a
mystery
of
them
how
at
all
they
can
stop
flying
butterflies
that
bear
upon
their
blue
wings
such
red
embers
round
they
seem
to
scorch
the
blue
air
into
holes
each
flight
they
take
and
that
suspire
in
short
soft
lapses
of
transported
flame
across
the
tingling
dark
while
overhead
the
constant
and
inviolable
stars
outburn
those
melodious
owls
if
music
had
but
one
note
and
was
sad
twould
sound
just
so
and
all
the
silent
swirl
of
bats
that
seem
to
follow
in
the
air
some
grand
circumference
of
a
shadowy
dome
to
which
we
are
blind
and
then
the
nightingales
which
pluck
our
heart
across
a
when
walking
in
the
town
and
carry
it
so
high
into
the
bowery
we
tremble
and
are
afraid
and
feel
as
if
the
golden
flood
of
moonlight
unaware
dissolved
the
pillars
of
the
steady
earth
and
made
it
less
substantial
and
i
knew
the
harmless
opal
snakes
and
frogs
those
noisy
vaunters
of
their
shallow
streams
and
lizards
the
green
lightnings
of
the
wall
which
if
you
sit
down
still
nor
sigh
too
loud
will
flatter
you
and
take
you
for
a
stone
and
flash
familiarly
about
your
feet
with
such
prodigious
eyes
in
such
small
heads
i
knew
them
though
they
had
somewhat
dwindled
from
my
childish
imagery
kept
in
mind
how
last
i
sate
among
them
equally
in
fellowship
and
mateship
as
a
child
will
bear
him
still
toward
insect
beast
and
bird
before
the
adam
in
him
has
foregone
all
privilege
of
eden
friends
and
talk
with
such
a
bird
or
such
a
goat
and
buying
many
a
to
let
out
the
caged
cricket
on
a
tree
saying
oh
my
dear
grillino
were
you
cramped
and
are
you
happy
with
the
and
do
you
love
me
who
have
let
you
go
say
in
singing
and
i
ll
but
now
the
creatures
all
seemed
farther
off
no
longer
mine
nor
like
me
only
a
gulph
between
us
i
could
yearn
indeed
like
other
rich
men
for
a
drop
of
dew
to
cool
this
heat
drop
of
the
early
dew
the
irrecoverable
before
the
heart
took
fire
and
withered
life
when
childhood
might
pair
equally
with
birds
but
now
the
birds
were
grown
too
proud
for
us
alas
the
very
sun
forbids
the
dew
and
i
i
had
come
back
to
an
empty
nest
which
every
bird
s
too
wise
for
how
i
heard
my
father
s
step
on
that
deserted
ground
his
voice
along
that
silence
as
he
told
the
names
of
bird
and
insect
tree
and
flower
and
all
the
presentations
of
the
stars
across
valdarno
interposing
still
my
child
my
when
fathers
say
my
child
tis
easier
to
conceive
the
universe
and
life
s
transitions
down
the
steps
of
law
i
rode
once
to
the
little
as
fast
as
if
to
find
my
father
there
but
when
in
sight
of
t
within
fifty
yards
i
dropped
my
horse
s
bridle
on
his
neck
and
paused
upon
his
flank
the
house
s
front
was
cased
with
lingots
of
ripe
indian
corn
in
tesselated
order
and
device
of
golden
patterns
not
a
stone
of
wall
uncovered
an
inch
of
room
to
grow
a
the
old
porch
had
disappeared
and
in
the
open
doorway
sate
a
girl
at
plaiting
straws
black
hair
strained
away
to
a
scarlet
kerchief
caught
beneath
her
chin
in
tuscan
fashion
full
ebon
eyes
which
looked
too
heavy
to
be
lifted
so
still
dropt
and
lifted
toward
the
on
which
the
lads
were
busy
with
their
staves
in
shout
and
laughter
stripping
all
the
boughs
as
bare
as
winter
of
those
summer
leaves
my
father
had
not
changed
for
all
the
silk
in
which
the
ugly
silkworms
hide
themselves
enough
my
horse
recoiled
before
my
i
turned
the
rein
abruptly
back
we
went
as
fast
to
florence
that
was
trial
enough
of
graves
i
would
not
visit
if
i
could
my
father
s
or
my
mother
s
any
more
to
see
if
or
lichen
beat
so
early
in
the
race
or
throw
my
flowers
which
could
not
heaven
or
sweeten
earth
they
live
too
far
above
that
i
should
look
so
far
below
to
find
them
let
me
think
that
rather
they
are
visiting
my
grave
this
life
here
undeveloped
yet
to
life
and
that
they
drop
upon
me
now
and
then
for
token
or
for
solace
some
small
weed
least
odorous
of
the
growths
of
paradise
to
spare
such
pungent
scents
as
kill
with
joy
my
old
assunta
too
was
dead
was
o
land
of
all
men
s
past
for
me
alone
it
would
not
mix
its
tenses
i
was
past
it
seemed
like
others
not
in
heaven
and
many
a
tuscan
eve
i
wandered
down
the
cypress
alley
like
a
restless
ghost
that
tries
its
feeble
ineffectual
breath
upon
its
own
charred
put
out
too
soon
black
and
stiff
stood
up
the
trees
against
the
broad
vermilion
of
the
skies
such
skies
clouds
abolished
in
a
sweep
of
god
s
skirt
with
a
dazzle
to
ghosts
and
men
as
down
i
went
saluting
on
the
bridge
the
hem
of
such
before
twas
caught
away
beyond
the
peaks
of
lucca
underneath
the
river
just
escaping
from
the
weight
of
that
intolerable
glory
ran
in
acquiescent
shadow
murmurously
and
up
beside
it
streamed
the
with
from
their
feet
and
fans
with
and
and
sweet
poise
of
vowels
in
their
pleasant
scandalous
talk
returning
from
the
s
before
the
trees
grew
dangerous
at
eight
for
trust
no
tree
by
moonlight
tuscans
say
to
eat
their
ice
at
doni
s
tenderly
each
lovely
lady
close
to
a
cavalier
who
holds
her
dear
fan
while
she
feeds
her
smile
on
meditative
spoonfuls
of
vanille
he
breathing
hot
protesting
vows
of
love
enough
to
thaw
her
cream
and
scorch
his
beard
twas
little
matter
i
could
pass
them
by
indifferently
not
fearing
to
be
known
no
danger
of
being
wrecked
upon
a
friend
and
forced
to
take
an
iceberg
for
an
isle
the
very
english
here
must
wait
to
learn
to
hang
the
cobweb
of
their
gossip
out
and
catch
a
fly
i
m
happy
it
s
sublime
this
perfect
solitude
of
foreign
lands
to
be
as
if
you
had
not
been
till
then
and
were
then
simply
that
you
chose
to
be
to
spring
up
not
be
brought
forth
from
the
ground
like
grasshoppers
at
athens
and
skip
thrice
before
a
woman
makes
a
pounce
on
you
and
plants
you
in
her
hair
yourself
a
new
world
all
alive
with
creatures
new
new
sun
new
moon
new
flowers
new
and
be
possessed
by
none
of
them
no
right
in
one
to
call
your
name
enquire
your
where
or
what
you
think
of
mister
s
book
or
mister
other
s
marriage
or
decease
or
how
s
the
headache
which
you
had
last
week
or
why
you
look
so
pale
still
since
it
s
gone
most
surprising
riddance
of
one
s
life
comes
next
one
s
death
it
s
disembodiment
without
the
pang
i
marvel
people
choose
to
stand
like
fakirs
till
the
moss
grows
on
them
and
they
cry
out
how
verdant
and
how
virtuous
well
i
m
glad
or
should
be
if
grown
foreign
to
myself
as
surely
as
to
others
musing
so
i
walked
the
narrow
unrecognising
streets
where
many
a
peers
gloomily
through
stony
vizors
prepared
alike
should
foe
or
lover
pass
that
way
for
guest
or
victim
and
came
wandering
out
upon
the
churches
with
mild
open
doors
and
plaintive
wail
of
vespers
where
a
few
those
chiefly
women
sprinkled
round
in
blots
upon
the
dusky
pavement
knelt
and
prayed
toward
the
altar
s
silver
glory
oft
a
ray
i
liked
to
sit
and
watch
would
tremble
out
just
touch
some
face
more
lifted
more
in
need
of
course
a
woman
i
dreamed
a
tale
to
fit
its
fortunes
there
was
one
who
looked
as
if
the
earth
had
suddenly
grown
too
large
for
such
a
little
humpbacked
thing
as
she
the
pitiful
black
kerchief
round
her
neck
sole
proof
she
had
had
a
mother
one
again
looked
sick
for
love
praying
some
soft
saint
to
put
more
virtue
in
the
new
fine
scarf
she
spent
a
fortnight
s
meals
on
yesterday
that
cruel
gigi
might
return
his
eyes
from
giuliana
there
was
one
so
old
so
old
to
kneel
grew
easier
than
to
stand
so
solitary
she
accepts
at
last
our
lady
for
her
gossip
and
frets
on
against
the
sinful
world
which
goes
its
rounds
in
marrying
and
being
married
just
the
same
as
when
twas
almost
good
and
had
the
right
her
gian
alive
and
she
herself
eighteen
and
yet
now
even
if
madonna
willed
she
d
win
a
tern
in
thursday
s
lottery
and
better
all
things
did
she
dream
for
nought
that
boiling
cabbage
for
the
s
soup
it
smelt
like
blessed
entrails
such
a
dream
for
nought
would
sweetest
mary
cheat
her
so
and
lose
that
certain
candle
straight
and
white
as
any
fair
in
her
teens
winch
otherwise
should
flare
here
in
a
week
thou
beauteous
queen
of
heaven
i
sate
there
musing
and
imagining
such
utterance
from
such
faces
poor
blind
souls
that
writhed
toward
heaven
along
the
devil
s
trail
who
knows
i
thought
but
he
may
stretch
his
hand
and
pick
them
up
tis
written
in
the
book
he
heareth
the
young
ravens
when
they
cry
and
yet
they
cry
for
my
god
and
we
who
make
excuses
for
the
rest
we
do
it
in
our
measure
then
i
knelt
and
dropped
my
head
upon
the
pavement
too
and
prayed
since
i
was
foolish
in
desire
like
other
creatures
craving
that
he
would
stop
his
ears
to
what
i
said
and
only
listen
to
the
run
and
beat
of
this
poor
passionate
helpless
and
then
i
lay
and
spoke
not
but
he
heard
in
heaven
so
many
tuscan
evenings
passed
the
same
i
could
not
lose
a
sunset
on
the
bridge
and
would
not
miss
a
vigil
in
the
church
and
liked
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
so
strange
and
gay
and
ignorant
of
my
face
for
men
you
know
not
are
as
good
as
trees
and
only
once
at
the
santissima
i
almost
chanced
upon
a
man
i
knew
sir
blaise
delorme
he
saw
me
certainly
and
somewhat
hurried
as
he
crossed
himself
the
smoothness
of
the
action
half
bowed
but
only
half
and
merely
to
my
shade
i
slipped
so
quick
behind
the
porphyry
plinth
and
left
him
dubious
if
twas
really
i
or
peradventure
satan
s
usual
trick
to
keep
a
mounting
saint
uncanonised
but
i
was
safe
for
that
time
and
he
too
the
argent
angels
in
the
absorbed
his
soul
next
moment
the
good
man
in
england
we
were
scarce
acquaintances
that
here
in
florence
he
should
keep
my
thought
beyond
the
image
on
his
eye
which
came
and
went
and
yet
his
thought
disturbed
my
life
for
after
that
i
oftener
sate
at
home
on
evenings
watching
how
they
fined
themselves
with
gradual
conscience
to
a
perfect
night
until
the
moon
diminished
to
a
curve
lay
out
there
like
a
sickle
for
his
hand
who
cometh
down
at
last
to
reap
the
earth
at
such
times
ended
seemed
my
trade
of
verse
i
feared
to
jingle
bells
upon
my
robe
before
the
silent
cherubim
with
god
so
near
me
could
i
sing
of
god
i
did
not
write
nor
read
nor
even
think
but
sate
absorbed
amid
the
quickening
glooms
most
like
some
passive
broken
lump
of
salt
dropt
in
by
chance
to
a
bowl
of
œnomel
to
spoil
the
drink
a
little
and
lose
itself
dissolving
slowly
slowly
until
lost
eighth
book
one
eve
it
happened
when
i
sate
alone
alone
upon
the
terrace
of
my
tower
a
book
upon
my
knees
to
counterfeit
the
reading
that
i
never
read
at
all
while
marian
in
the
garden
down
below
knelt
by
the
fountain
i
could
just
hear
thrill
the
drowsy
silence
of
the
exhausted
day
and
peeled
a
new
fig
from
that
purple
heap
in
the
grass
beside
her
out
the
red
to
feed
her
eager
child
who
sucked
at
it
with
vehement
lips
across
a
gap
of
air
as
he
stood
opposite
face
and
curls
with
that
last
crying
give
me
give
and
stamping
with
imperious
we
re
all
born
princes
startled
me
the
laugh
of
sad
and
innocent
souls
that
breaks
abruptly
as
if
frightened
at
itself
twas
marian
laughed
i
saw
her
glance
above
in
sudden
shame
that
i
should
hear
her
laugh
and
straightway
dropped
my
eyes
upon
my
book
and
knew
the
first
time
twas
boccaccio
s
tales
the
falcon
s
the
lover
who
for
love
destroyed
the
best
that
loved
him
some
of
us
do
it
still
and
then
we
sit
and
laugh
no
more
laugh
sweet
marian
you
ve
the
right
to
laugh
since
god
himself
is
for
you
and
a
child
for
me
there
s
somewhat
less
so
i
sigh
the
heavens
were
making
room
to
hold
the
night
the
sevenfold
heavens
unfolding
all
their
gates
to
let
the
stars
out
slowly
prophesied
in
advent
not
discerned
while
still
the
from
the
cypresses
of
the
poggio
called
and
counted
every
pulse
of
the
skyey
palpitation
gradually
the
purple
and
transparent
shadows
slow
had
filled
up
the
whole
valley
to
the
brim
and
flooded
all
the
city
which
you
saw
as
some
drowned
city
in
some
enchanted
sea
cut
off
from
nature
you
who
gaze
with
passionate
desire
to
leap
and
plunge
and
find
a
with
a
voice
of
waves
and
treacherous
soft
eyes
and
slippery
locks
you
can
not
kiss
but
you
shall
bring
away
their
salt
upon
your
lips
the
strikes
ten
as
if
it
struck
ten
fathoms
down
so
deep
and
fifty
churches
answer
it
the
same
with
fifty
various
instances
some
gaslights
tremble
along
squares
and
streets
the
pitti
s
is
drawn
in
fire
and
past

place
in
which
the
mystic
obelisks
stand
up
triangular
pyramidal
each
based
on
a
single

of

tortoises
to
guard

fair

buonarroti
s
bride
that
stares
out
from
her
large
blind
her
quadrant
and
armillary
dials
black
with
rhythms
of
many
suns
and
moons
in
vain
enquiry
for
so
rich
a
soul
as
his
methinks
i
have
plunged
i
see
it
all
so
clear
and
oh
my
heart
the
in
my
ears
the
sound
of
waters
there
he
stood
my
king
i
felt
him
rather
than
beheld
him
up
i
rose
as
if
he
were
my
king
indeed
and
then
sate
down
in
trouble
at
myself
and
struggling
for
my
woman
s
empery
tis
pitiful
but
women
are
so
made
we
ll
die
for
you
perhaps
tis
probable
but
we
ll
not
spare
you
an
inch
of
our
full
height
we
ll
have
our
whole
just
stature
feet
four
though
laid
out
in
our
coffins
pitiful
you
romney
lady
waldemar
is
here
he
answered
in
a
voice
which
was
not
his
i
have
her
letter
you
shall
read
it
soon
but
first
i
must
be
heard
a
little
i
who
have
waited
long
and
travelled
far
for
that
although
you
thought
to
have
shut
a
tedious
book
and
farewell
ah
you
such
a
page
and
here
you
find
did
he
touch
my
hand
or
but
my
sleeve
i
trembled
hand
and
foot
he
must
have
touched
will
you
sit
i
asked
and
motioned
to
a
chair
but
down
he
sate
a
little
slowly
as
a
man
in
doubt
upon
the
couch
beside
me
and
chair
being
wheeled
upon
the
terrace
you
are
come
my
cousin
romney
is
wonderful
but
all
is
wonder
on
such
and
nothing
should
surprise
us
any
more
who
see
that
miracle
of
stars
i
signed
above
where
all
the
stars
were
out
as
if
an
urgent
heat
had
started
there
a
secret
writing
from
a
sombre
page
a
blank
last
moment
crowded
suddenly
with
hurrying
splendours
then
you
do
not
know
he
murmured
yes
i
know
i
said
i
know
i
had
the
news
from
vincent
carrington
and
yet
i
did
not
think
you
d
leave
the
work
in
england
for
so
much
even
of
course
you
ll
make
a
of
your
holiday
and
turn
it
to
our
tuscan
people
s
use
who
much
need
helping
since
the
austrian
boar
so
bold
to
cross
the
alp
by
lombardy
and
dash
his
brute
front
unabashed
against
the
steep
of
that
shield
of
god
who
soon
shall
rise
in
wrath
and
shake
it
clear
came
hither
also
up
our
vines
and
with
his
tyrannous
tusks
and
rolling
on
our
maize
with
all
his
swine
you
had
the
news
from
vincent
carrington
he
echoed
up
the
phrase
beyond
as
if
he
knew
the
rest
was
merely
talk
to
fill
a
gap
and
keep
out
a
strong
wind
you
had
then
vincent
s
personal
news
his
own
i
answered
all
that
ruined
world
of
yours
seems
crumbling
into
marriage
carrington
has
chosen
do
take
it
so
he
cried
and
is
it
possible
at
last
he
paused
there
then
inward
to
himself
too
much
at
last
too
late
certainly
and
there
his
voice
swayed
as
an
alpine
plank
that
feels
a
passionate
torrent
underneath
the
knowledge
if
i
had
known
it
first
or
last
had
never
changed
the
actual
case
for
and
best
for
at
this
nay
i
thought
he
loves
kate
ward
it
seems
now
like
a
man
because
he
has
married
lady
waldemar
ah
vincent
s
letter
said
how
leigh
was
moved
to
hear
that
vincent
was
betrothed
to
kate
with
what
cracked
pitchers
go
we
to
deep
wells
in
this
world
then
i
spoke
i
did
not
think
my
cousin
you
had
ever
known
kate
in
fact
i
never
knew
her
tis
enough
that
vincent
did
before
he
chose
his
wife
for
other
reasons
than
those
topaz
eyes
i
ve
heard
of
not
to
undervalue
them
for
all
that
one
takes
up
the
world
with
romney
leigh
i
thought
again
albeit
he
knows
them
only
by
repute
how
vile
must
all
men
be
since
a
man
his
deep
pathetic
voice
as
if
he
guessed
i
did
not
surely
love
him
took
the
word
you
never
got
a
letter
from
lord
howe
a
month
back
dear
aurora
none
i
said
i
felt
it
was
so
he
replied
yet
strange
sir
blaise
delorme
has
passed
through
florence
ay
by
chance
i
saw
him
in
our
lady
s
church
i
saw
him
mark
you
but
he
saw
not
me
in
holy
water
from
the
count
of
things
terrestrial
and
the
rest
he
had
crossed
us
out
together
with
his
sins
ay
strange
but
only
strange
that
good
lord
howe
preferred
him
to
the
post
because
of
pauls
for
me
i
m
sworn
to
never
trust
a
at
least
with
there
were
facts
to
tell
to
smooth
with
eye
and
accent
howe
supposed
well
well
no
matter
there
was
dubious
need
you
heard
the
news
from
vincent
carrington
and
yet
perhaps
you
had
been
startled
less
to
see
me
dear
aurora
if
you
had
read
that
he
sets
me
down
as
vexed
i
think
i
ve
draped
myself
in
woman
s
pride
to
a
perfect
purpose
oh
i
m
vexed
it
seems
my
friend
lord
howe
deputes
his
friend
sir
blaise
to
break
as
softly
as
a
sparrow
s
egg
that
lets
a
bird
out
tenderly
the
news
of
romney
s
marriage
to
a
certain
saint
to
with
eye
and
his
possible
presence
excellently
well
you
ve
played
your
part
my
lady
waldemar
as
i
ve
played
mine
dear
romney
i
began
you
did
not
use
of
old
to
be
so
like
a
greek
king
coming
from
a
taken
troy
twas
needful
that
precursors
spread
your
path
with
carpets
to
receive
your
foot
and
dull
the
sound
of
t
for
myself
be
sure
although
it
frankly
ground
the
gravel
here
i
still
could
bear
it
yet
i
m
sorry
too
to
lose
this
famous
letter
which
sir
blaise
has
twisted
to
a
lighter
absently
to
fire
some
holy
taper
with
lord
howe
writes
letters
good
for
all
things
but
to
lose
and
many
a
flower
of
london
gossipry
has
dropt
wherever
such
a
stem
broke
off
of
course
i
know
that
lonely
among
my
vines
where
nothing
s
talked
of
save
the
blight
again
and
no
more
chianti
still
the
letter
s
use
as
preparation
did
i
start
indeed
last
night
i
started
at
a
cockchafer
and
shook
a
after
have
you
learnt
no
more
of
women
spite
of
privilege
than
still
to
take
account
too
seriously
of
such
weak
flutterings
why
we
like
it
sir
we
get
our
powers
and
our
effects
that
way
the
trees
stand
stiff
and
still
at
time
of
frost
if
no
wind
tears
them
but
let
summer
come
when
trees
are
happy
a
breath
avails
to
set
them
trembling
through
a
million
leaves
in
luxury
of
emotion
something
less
it
takes
to
move
a
woman
let
her
start
and
shake
at
pleasure
conclude
at
yours
the
winter
s
bitter
the
summer
s
he
answered
be
the
summer
ever
green
with
you
aurora
you
sweep
your
sex
with
somewhat
bitter
gusts
from
where
you
live
above
them
downward
from
your
heights
your
very
own
in
a
grand
disdain
of
the
lowland
burrs
with
which
you
scatter
them
so
high
and
cold
to
others
and
yourself
a
little
less
to
romney
were
unjust
and
thus
i
would
not
have
you
let
it
pass
i
feel
content
so
you
can
bear
indeed
my
sudden
step
beside
you
but
for
me
twould
move
me
sore
to
hear
your
softened
voice
aurora
s
voice
softened
unaware
in
pity
of
what
i
ah
friend
i
thought
as
husband
of
the
lady
waldemar
you
re
granted
very
sorely
pitiable
and
yet
aurora
leigh
must
guard
her
voice
from
softening
in
the
pity
of
your
case
as
if
from
lie
or
licence
certainly
we
ll
soak
up
all
the
slush
and
soil
of
life
with
softened
voices
ere
we
come
to
at
which
i
interrupted
my
own
thought
and
spoke
out
calmly
let
us
ponder
friend
whate
er
our
state
we
must
have
made
it
first
and
though
the
thing
displease
us
ay
perhaps
displease
us
warrantably
never
doubt
that
other
states
thought
possible
once
and
then
rejected
by
the
instinct
of
our
lives
if
then
adopted
had
displeased
us
more
than
this
in
which
the
choice
the
will
the
love
has
stamped
the
honour
of
a
patent
act
from
henceforth
what
we
choose
may
not
be
good
but
that
we
choose
it
proves
it
good
for
potentially
fantastically
now
or
last
year
rather
than
a
thing
we
saw
and
saw
no
need
for
choosing
moths
will
burn
their
wings
proves
that
light
is
good
for
moths
or
else
they
had
flown
not
where
they
agonise
ay
light
is
good
he
echoed
and
there
paused
and
then
abruptly
marian
marian
s
well
i
bowed
my
head
but
found
no
word
twas
hard
to
speak
of
to
lady
waldemar
s
new
husband
how
much
did
he
know
at
last
how
much
how
little
he
would
take
no
sign
but
straight
repeated
marian
is
she
well
she
s
well
i
answered
she
was
there
in
sight
an
hour
back
but
the
night
had
drawn
her
home
where
still
i
heard
her
in
an
upper
room
her
low
voice
singing
to
the
child
in
bed
who
restless
with
the
and
play
and
slumber
snatched
at
noon
was
long
sometimes
at
falling
off
and
took
a
score
of
songs
and
ere
she
saw
him
sound
she
s
well
i
answered
here
he
asked
yes
he
stopped
and
sighed
that
shall
be
presently
but
now
this
must
be
i
have
words
to
say
and
would
be
alone
to
say
them
i
with
you
and
no
third
speak
then
i
returned
she
will
not
vex
at
which
suddenly
he
turned
his
face
upon
me
with
its
smile
as
if
to
crush
me
i
have
read
your
book
you
have
read
it
i
replied
and
i
have
writ
it
have
done
with
it
and
now
the
rest
the
rest
is
like
the
first
he
answered
for
the
book
is
in
my
heart
lives
in
me
wakes
in
me
and
dreams
in
me
my
daily
bread
tastes
of
it
my
wine
which
has
no
smack
of
it
i
pour
it
out
it
seems
unnatural
bitterly
i
took
the
word
up
never
waste
your
wine
the
book
lived
in
me
ere
it
lived
in
you
i
know
it
closer
than
another
does
and
that
it
s
foolish
feeble
and
afraid
and
all
unworthy
so
much
compliment
beseech
you
keep
your
wine
when
you
drink
still
wish
some
happier
fortune
to
your
friend
than
even
to
have
written
a
far
better
he
answered
gently
that
is
consequent
the
poet
looks
beyond
the
book
he
has
made
or
else
he
had
not
made
it
if
a
man
could
make
a
man
he
d
henceforth
be
a
god
in
feeling
what
a
little
thing
is
man
it
is
not
my
case
and
this
special
book
i
did
not
make
it
to
make
light
of
it
it
stands
above
my
knowledge
draws
me
up
tis
high
to
me
it
may
be
that
the
book
is
not
so
high
but
i
so
low
instead
still
high
to
me
i
mean
no
compliment
i
will
not
say
there
are
not
young
or
old
male
writers
ay
or
female
it
pass
who
ll
write
us
richer
and
completer
books
a
man
may
love
a
woman
perfectly
and
yet
by
no
means
ignorantly
maintain
a
thousand
women
have
not
larger
eyes
enough
that
she
alone
has
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
large
or
small
have
won
his
soul
and
so
this
book
aurora
your
alas
i
answered
is
it
so
indeed
and
then
was
silent
is
it
so
indeed
he
echoed
that
is
all
your
word
i
said
i
m
thinking
of
a
june
when
you
and
i
upon
my
birthday
once
discoursed
of
life
and
art
with
both
untried
i
m
thinking
romney
how
twas
morning
then
and
now
tis
and
now
he
said
tis
i
m
thinking
i
resumed
tis
somewhat
sad
that
if
i
had
known
that
morning
in
the
dew
my
cousin
romney
would
have
said
such
words
on
such
a
night
at
close
of
many
years
in
speaking
of
a
future
book
of
mine
it
would
have
pleased
me
better
as
a
hope
than
as
an
actual
grace
it
can
at
all
that
s
sad
i
m
ay
he
said
tis
and
there
i
added
lightly
are
the
stars
and
here
we
ll
talk
of
stars
and
not
of
you
have
the
stars
he
murmured
it
is
well
be
like
them
shine
aurora
on
my
dark
though
high
and
cold
and
only
like
a
star
and
for
this
short
night
only
who
keep
the
same
aurora
of
the
bright
june
day
that
withered
up
the
flowers
before
my
face
and
turned
me
from
the
garden
evermore
because
i
was
not
worthy
oh
deserved
deserved
that
i
who
verily
had
not
learnt
god
s
lesson
half
attaining
as
a
dunce
to
obliterate
good
words
with
fractious
thumbs
and
cheat
myself
of
the
context
should
push
aside
with
male
ferocious
impudence
the
world
s
aurora
who
had
conned
her
part
on
the
other
side
the
leaf
ignore
her
so
because
she
was
a
woman
and
a
queen
and
had
no
beard
to
bristle
through
her
song
my
teacher
who
has
taught
me
with
a
book
my
miriam
whose
sweet
mouth
when
nearly
drowned
i
still
heard
singing
on
the
shore
deserved
that
here
i
should
look
up
unto
the
stars
and
miss
the
glory
can
i
understand
i
broke
in
you
speak
wildly
romney
leigh
or
i
hear
wildly
in
that
we
recollect
the
roses
were
too
red
the
trees
too
green
reproach
too
natural
if
one
should
see
not
what
the
other
saw
and
now
it
s
night
remember
we
have
shades
in
place
of
colours
we
are
now
grown
cold
and
old
my
cousin
romney
pardon
me
i
m
very
happy
that
you
like
my
book
and
very
sorry
that
i
quoted
back
a
ten
years
birthday
twas
so
mad
a
thing
in
any
woman
i
scarce
marvel
much
you
took
it
for
a
venturous
piece
of
spite
provoking
such
excuses
as
indeed
i
can
not
call
you
slack
understand
he
answered
sadly
something
if
but
so
this
night
is
softer
than
an
english
day
and
men
may
well
come
hither
when
they
re
sick
to
draw
in
easier
breath
from
larger
air
tis
thus
with
me
i
ve
come
to
you
you
my
italy
of
women
just
to
breathe
my
soul
out
once
before
you
ere
i
go
as
humble
as
god
makes
me
at
the
last
i
thank
him
quite
out
of
the
way
of
men
and
yours
aurora
a
punished
child
his
cheeks
all
blurred
with
tears
and
naughtiness
to
silence
in
a
corner
i
am
come
to
speak
beloved
wisely
cousin
leigh
and
worthily
of
us
both
yes
worthily
for
this
time
i
must
speak
out
and
confess
that
i
so
truculent
in
assumption
once
so
absolute
in
dogma
proud
in
aim
and
fierce
in
expectation
who
felt
the
whole
world
tugging
at
my
skirts
for
help
as
if
no
other
man
than
i
could
pull
nor
woman
but
i
led
her
by
the
hand
nor
cloth
hold
but
i
had
it
in
my
coat
do
know
myself
for
what
i
was
on
that
aurora
poor
bright
day
which
meant
the
best
a
woman
and
a
rose
and
which
i
smote
upon
the
cheek
with
words
until
it
turned
and
rent
me
young
you
were
that
birthday
poet
but
you
talked
the
right
while
i
i
built
up
follies
like
a
wall
to
intercept
the
sunshine
and
your
face
your
face
that
s
speak
wisely
cousin
yes
wisely
dear
aurora
though
too
late
but
then
not
wisely
i
was
heavy
then
and
stupid
and
distracted
with
the
cries
of
tortured
prisoners
in
the
polished
brass
of
that
phalarian
bull
society
which
seems
to
bellow
bravely
like
ten
bulls
but
if
you
listen
moans
and
cries
instead
despairingly
like
victims
tossed
and
gored
and
trampled
by
their
hoofs
i
heard
the
cries
too
close
i
could
not
hear
the
angels
lift
a
fold
of
rustling
air
nor
what
they
said
to
help
my
pity
i
beheld
the
world
as
one
great
famishing
carnivorous
mouth
a
huge
deserted
callow
black
bird
thing
with
piteous
open
beak
that
hurt
my
heart
till
down
upon
the
filthy
ground
i
dropped
and
tore
the
violets
up
to
get
the
worms
worms
worms
was
all
my
cry
an
open
mouth
a
gross
want
bread
to
fill
it
to
the
lips
no
more
that
poor
men
narrowed
their
demands
to
such
an
end
was
virtue
i
supposed
adjudicating
that
to
see
it
so
was
reason
oh
i
did
not
push
the
case
up
higher
and
ponder
how
it
answers
when
the
rich
take
up
the
same
cry
for
themselves
professing
equally
an
open
mouth
a
gross
want
food
to
fill
us
and
no
more
why
that
s
so
far
from
virtue
only
vice
finds
reason
for
it
that
makes
libertines
that
slurs
our
cruel
streets
from
end
to
end
with
eighty
thousand
women
in
one
smile
who
only
smile
at
night
beneath
the
gas
the
body
s
satisfaction
and
no
more
being
used
for
argument
against
the
soul
s
here
too
the
want
here
too
implying
the
right
dark
i
stood
that
morning
in
the
sun
my
best
aurora
though
i
saw
your
eyes
when
first
you
told
me
oh
i
recollect
the
words
and
how
you
lifted
your
white
hand
and
how
your
white
dress
and
your
burnished
curls
went
greatening
round
you
in
the
still
blue
air
as
if
an
inspiration
from
within
had
blown
them
all
out
when
you
spoke
the
same
even
these
you
will
not
compass
your
poor
ends
of
and
material
ease
without
the
poet
s
individualism
to
work
your
universal
it
takes
a
soul
to
move
a
body
takes
a
man
to
move
the
masses
even
to
a
cleaner
stye
it
takes
the
ideal
to
blow
an
inch
inside
the
dust
of
the
actual
and
your
fouriers
failed
because
not
poets
enough
to
understand
that
life
develops
from
i
say
your
words
could
say
other
words
of
yours
for
none
of
all
your
words
has
been
more
lost
than
sweet
verbena
which
being
brushed
against
will
hold
you
three
hours
after
by
the
smell
in
spite
of
long
walks
on
the
windy
hills
but
these
words
dealt
in
sharper
perfume
were
ever
on
me
stinging
through
my
dreams
and
saying
themselves
for
ever
o
er
my
acts
like
some
unhappy
verdict
that
i
failed
is
certain
stye
or
no
stye
to
contrive
the
swine
s
propulsion
toward
the
precipice
proved
easy
and
plain
i
subtly
organised
and
ordered
built
the
cards
up
high
and
higher
till
some
one
breathing
all
fell
flat
again
in
setting
right
society
s
wide
wrong
mere
life
s
so
fatal
so
i
failed
indeed
once
twice
and
oftener
through
the
rents
of
obstinate
purpose
still
those
words
of
yours
will
not
compass
your
poor
ends
not
you
but
harder
than
you
said
them
every
time
still
farther
from
your
voice
until
they
came
to
overcrow
me
with
triumphant
scorn
which
vexed
me
to
resistance
set
down
this
for
condemnation
was
guilty
here
i
stood
upon
my
deed
and
fought
my
doubt
as
men
will
i
doubted
at
last
my
deed
gave
way
beneath
me
suddenly
and
left
me
what
i
am
the
curtain
dropped
my
part
quite
ended
all
the
footlights
quenched
my
own
soul
hissing
at
me
through
the
dark
i
ready
for
confession
was
wrong
i
ve
sorely
failed
i
ve
slipped
the
ends
of
life
i
yield
you
have
stay
i
answered
him
i
ve
something
for
your
hearing
also
i
have
failed
you
he
said
you
re
very
great
the
sadness
of
your
greatness
fits
you
well
as
if
the
plume
upon
a
hero
s
casque
should
nod
a
shadow
upon
his
victor
i
took
him
up
austerely
you
have
read
my
book
but
not
my
heart
for
recollect
tis
writ
in
sanscrit
which
you
bungle
at
i
ve
surely
failed
i
know
if
failure
means
to
look
back
sadly
on
work
gladly
done
to
wander
on
my
mountains
of
delight
so
called
i
can
remember
a
friend
s
words
as
well
as
you
sir
weary
and
in
want
of
even
a
thinking
bitterly
well
well
no
matter
i
but
say
so
much
to
keep
you
romney
leigh
from
saying
more
and
let
you
feel
i
am
not
so
high
indeed
that
i
can
bear
to
have
you
at
my
foot
or
safe
that
i
can
help
you
that
too
deeply
sunk
in
craterous
sunsets
now
for
you
or
me
to
dig
it
up
alive
to
pluck
it
out
all
bleeding
with
spent
flame
at
the
roots
before
those
moralising
stars
we
have
got
instead
poor
lost
day
you
said
some
words
as
truthful
as
the
thing
of
mine
you
care
to
keep
in
memory
and
i
hold
if
i
that
day
and
being
the
girl
i
was
had
shown
a
gentler
spirit
less
arrogance
it
had
not
hurt
me
ah
you
ll
not
mistake
the
point
here
i
but
only
think
you
see
more
justly
that
s
more
humbly
of
myself
than
when
i
tried
a
crown
on
and
supposed
nay
laugh
sir
ll
laugh
with
you
you
laugh
i
ve
had
so
many
birthdays
since
that
day
i
ve
learnt
to
prize
mirth
s
opportunities
which
come
too
seldom
was
it
you
who
said
i
was
not
changed
the
same
aurora
ah
we
could
laugh
there
too
why
ulysses
dog
knew
and
wagged
his
tail
and
died
but
if
i
had
owned
a
dog
i
too
before
my
troy
and
if
you
brought
him
here
i
warrant
you
he
d
look
into
my
face
bark
lustily
and
live
on
stoutly
as
the
creatures
will
whose
spirits
are
not
troubled
by
long
loves
a
dog
would
never
know
me
i
m
so
changed
much
less
a
friend
except
that
you
re
misled
by
the
colour
of
the
hair
the
trick
of
the
voice
like
that
aurora
leigh
sweet
trick
of
voice
i
would
be
a
dog
for
this
to
know
it
at
last
and
die
upon
the
falls
of
it
o
love
o
best
aurora
are
you
then
so
sad
you
scarcely
had
been
sadder
as
my
wife
your
wife
sir
i
must
certainly
be
changed
if
i
aurora
can
have
said
a
thing
so
light
it
catches
at
the
knightly
spurs
of
a
noble
gentleman
like
romney
leigh
and
trips
him
from
his
honourable
sense
of
what
befits
you
wholly
misconceive
he
answered
i
returned
i
m
glad
of
it
but
keep
from
misconception
too
yourself
i
am
not
humbled
to
so
low
a
point
nor
so
far
saddened
if
i
am
sad
at
all
ten
layers
of
birthdays
on
a
woman
s
head
are
apt
to
fossilise
her
girlish
mirth
though
ne
er
so
merry
i
m
perforce
more
wise
and
that
in
truth
means
sadder
for
the
rest
look
here
sir
i
was
right
upon
the
whole
that
birthday
morning
tis
impossible
to
get
at
men
excepting
through
their
souls
however
open
their
carnivorous
jaws
and
poets
get
directlier
at
the
soul
than
any
of
your
œconomists
which
you
must
not
overlook
the
poet
s
work
when
scheming
for
the
world
s
necessities
the
soul
s
the
way
not
even
christ
himself
can
save
man
else
than
as
he
holds
man
s
soul
and
therefore
did
he
come
into
our
flesh
as
some
wise
hunter
creeping
on
his
knees
with
a
torch
into
the
blackness
of
some
cave
to
face
and
quell
the
beast
there
the
soul
and
so
possess
the
whole
man
body
and
soul
i
said
so
far
right
yes
not
farther
though
we
both
were
wrong
that
as
wrong
as
an
east
wind
had
been
i
who
talked
of
art
and
you
who
grieved
for
all
men
s
griefs
what
then
we
surely
made
too
small
a
part
for
god
in
these
things
what
we
are
imports
us
more
than
what
we
eat
and
life
you
ve
granted
me
develops
from
within
but
innermost
of
the
inmost
most
interior
of
the
interne
god
claims
his
own
divine
humanity
renewing
nature
the
piercingest
verse
prest
in
by
subtlest
poet
still
must
keep
as
much
upon
the
outside
of
a
man
as
the
very
bowl
in
which
he
dips
his
beard
then
the
rest
i
can
not
surely
speak
perhaps
i
doubt
more
than
you
doubted
then
if
i
the
poet
s
veritable
charge
have
borne
upon
my
forehead
if
i
have
it
might
feel
somewhat
liker
to
a
crown
the
foolish
green
one
i
think
and
chiefly
when
the
sun
shines
that
i
ve
failed
but
what
then
romney
though
we
fail
indeed
you
i
a
score
of
such
weak
workers
he
fails
never
if
he
can
not
work
by
us
he
will
work
over
us
does
he
want
a
man
much
less
a
woman
think
you
every
time
the
star
winks
there
so
many
souls
are
born
who
all
shall
work
too
let
our
own
be
calm
we
should
be
ashamed
to
sit
beneath
those
stars
impatient
that
we
re
could
we
sit
just
so
for
ever
sweetest
friend
he
said
my
failure
would
seem
better
than
success
and
yet
indeed
your
book
has
dealt
with
me
more
gently
cousin
than
you
ever
will
the
book
brought
down
entire
the
bright
and
set
me
wandering
in
the
and
let
me
watch
the
garland
in
a
place
you
blushed
so
nay
forgive
me
do
not
stir
i
only
thank
the
book
for
what
it
taught
and
what
permitted
poet
doubt
yourself
but
never
doubt
that
you
re
a
poet
to
me
from
henceforth
ah
you
ve
written
poems
sweet
which
moved
me
in
secret
as
the
sap
is
moved
in
still
signless
as
a
stone
but
this
last
book
o
ercame
me
like
soft
rain
which
falls
at
midnight
when
the
tightened
bark
breaks
out
into
unhesitating
buds
and
sudden
protestations
of
the
spring
in
all
your
other
books
i
saw
but
a
man
may
see
the
moon
so
in
a
pond
and
not
be
nearer
therefore
to
the
moon
nor
use
the
sight
except
to
drown
himself
and
so
i
forced
my
heart
back
from
the
sight
for
what
had
i
thought
to
do
with
aurora
romney
but
in
this
last
book
you
showed
me
something
separate
from
yourself
beyond
you
and
i
bore
to
take
it
in
and
let
it
draw
me
you
have
shown
me
truths
o
friend
that
help
me
now
at
night
when
june
is
over
truths
not
yours
indeed
but
set
within
my
reach
by
means
of
you
presented
by
your
voice
and
verse
the
way
to
take
them
clearest
verily
i
was
wrong
and
verily
many
thinkers
of
this
age
ay
many
christian
teachers
half
in
heaven
are
wrong
in
just
my
sense
who
understood
our
natural
world
too
insularly
as
if
no
spiritual
counterpart
completed
it
consummating
its
meaning
rounding
all
to
justice
and
perfection
line
by
line
form
by
form
nothing
single
nor
alone
the
great
below
clenched
by
the
great
above
shade
here
authenticating
substance
there
the
body
proving
spirit
as
the
effect
the
cause
we
meantime
being
too
grossly
apt
to
hold
the
natural
as
dogs
a
bone
though
reason
and
nature
beat
us
in
the
face
so
obstinately
that
we
ll
break
our
teeth
or
ever
we
let
go
for
everywhere
we
re
too
materialistic
clay
like
men
of
the
west
instead
of
adam
s
corn
and
noah
s
wine
clay
by
handfuls
clay
by
lumps
until
we
re
filled
up
to
the
throat
with
clay
and
grow
the
grimy
colour
of
the
ground
on
which
we
are
feeding
ay
materialist
the
age
s
name
is
god
himself
with
some
is
apprehended
as
the
bare
result
of
what
his
hand
materially
has
made
expressed
in
such
an
algebraic
sign
called
god
is
to
put
it
otherwise
they
add
up
nature
to
a
naught
of
god
and
cross
the
quotient
there
are
many
even
whose
names
are
written
in
the
christian
church
to
no
dishonour
still
on
mud
and
splash
the
altars
with
it
you
might
think
the
clay
christ
laid
upon
their
eyelids
when
still
blind
he
called
them
to
the
use
of
sight
remained
there
to
retard
its
exercise
with
clogging
incrustations
close
to
heaven
they
see
for
mysteries
through
the
open
doors
vague
puffs
of
smoke
from
pots
of
earthenware
and
fain
would
enter
when
their
time
shall
come
with
quite
a
different
body
than
paul
has
promised
and
chaff
the
whole
or
where
s
the
resurrection
thus
it
is
i
sighed
and
he
resumed
with
mournful
face
beginning
so
and
filling
up
with
clay
the
wards
of
this
great
key
the
natural
world
and
fumbling
vainly
therefore
at
the
lock
of
the
spiritual
feel
ourselves
shut
in
with
all
the
roar
of
struggling
life
the
terrors
and
compunctions
of
our
souls
as
saints
with
lions
who
are
not
saints
and
have
no
heavenly
lordship
in
our
stare
to
awe
them
backward
ay
we
are
forced
so
pent
to
judge
the
whole
too
partially
confound
conclusions
is
there
any
common
phrase
significant
when
the
adverb
s
heard
alone
the
verb
being
absent
and
the
pronoun
out
but
we
distracted
in
the
roar
of
life
still
insolently
at
god
s
adverb
snatch
and
bruit
against
him
that
his
thought
is
void
his
meaning
hopeless
that
everywhere
the
government
is
slipping
from
his
hand
unless
some
other
christ
say
romney
leigh
come
up
and
toil
and
moil
and
change
the
world
for
which
the
first
has
proved
inadequate
however
we
talk
bigly
of
his
work
and
piously
of
his
person
we
blaspheme
at
last
to
finish
that
doxology
despairing
on
the
earth
for
which
he
so
now
i
asked
you
have
more
hope
of
men
i
hope
he
answered
i
am
come
to
think
that
god
will
have
his
work
done
as
you
said
and
that
we
need
not
be
disturbed
too
much
for
romney
leigh
or
others
having
failed
with
this
or
that
quack
nostrum
for
keeping
summits
by
annulling
depths
for
learning
wrestling
with
long
lounging
sleeves
and
perfect
heroism
without
a
scratch
we
fail
then
aurora
if
i
smiled
to
see
you
in
your
lovely
try
on
the
poet
s
wreath
which
suits
the
noon
sweet
cousin
walls
must
get
the
before
they
grow
the
ivy
certainly
i
stood
myself
there
worthier
of
contempt
in
disastrous
arrogance
as
competent
to
sorrow
for
mankind
and
even
their
odds
a
man
may
well
despair
who
counts
himself
so
needful
to
success
i
failed
i
throw
the
remedy
back
on
god
and
sit
down
here
beside
you
in
good
and
yet
take
heed
i
answered
lest
we
lean
too
dangerously
on
the
other
side
and
so
fail
twice
be
sure
no
earnest
work
of
any
honest
creature
howbeit
weak
imperfect
fails
so
much
it
is
not
gathered
as
a
grain
of
sand
to
enlarge
the
sum
of
human
action
used
for
carrying
out
god
s
end
no
creature
works
so
ill
observe
that
therefore
he
s
cashiered
the
honest
earnest
man
must
stand
and
work
the
woman
also
otherwise
she
drops
at
once
below
the
dignity
of
man
accepting
serfdom
free
men
freely
work
whoever
fears
god
fears
to
sit
at
he
cried
true
after
adam
work
was
curse
the
natural
creature
labours
sweats
and
frets
but
after
christ
work
turns
to
privilege
and
henceforth
one
with
our
humanity
the
worker
working
still
in
us
has
called
us
freely
to
work
on
with
him
in
high
companionship
so
happiest
i
count
that
heaven
itself
is
only
work
to
a
surer
issue
let
us
work
indeed
but
no
more
work
as
adam
nor
as
leigh
erewhile
as
if
the
only
man
on
earth
responsible
for
all
the
thistles
blown
and
tigers
couchant
in
amaze
against
disease
and
winter
on
for
ever
that
the
world
s
not
paradise
oh
cousin
let
us
be
content
in
work
to
do
the
thing
we
can
and
not
presume
to
fret
because
it
s
little
twill
employ
seven
men
they
say
to
make
a
perfect
pin
who
makes
the
head
content
to
miss
the
point
who
makes
the
point
agreed
to
leave
the
join
and
if
a
man
should
cry
i
want
a
pin
and
i
must
make
it
straightway
head
and
point
his
wisdom
is
not
worth
the
pin
he
wants
seven
men
to
a
pin
not
a
man
too
much
seven
generations
haply
to
this
world
to
right
it
visibly
a
finger
s
breadth
and
mend
its
rents
a
little
oh
to
storm
and
say
this
world
here
is
intolerable
i
will
not
eat
this
corn
nor
drink
this
wine
nor
love
this
woman
flinging
her
my
soul
without
a
bond
for
t
as
a
lover
should
nor
use
the
generous
leave
of
happiness
as
not
too
good
for
using
generously
since
virtue
kindles
at
the
touch
of
joy
like
a
man
s
cheek
laid
on
a
woman
s
hand
and
god
who
knows
it
looks
for
quick
returns
from
joys
stand
and
claim
to
have
a
life
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
individual
man
and
raze
all
personal
cloisters
of
the
soul
to
build
up
public
stores
and
magazines
as
if
god
s
creatures
otherwise
were
lost
the
builder
surely
saved
by
any
means
to
think
have
a
pattern
on
my
nail
and
i
will
carve
the
world
new
after
it
and
solve
so
these
hard
social
questions
impossible
social
questions
their
roots
strike
deep
in
evil
s
own
existence
here
which
god
permits
because
the
question
s
hard
to
abolish
evil
nor
attaint
ay
hard
to
god
but
not
to
romney
leigh
for
romney
has
a
pattern
on
his
nail
whatever
may
be
lacking
on
the
mount
and
not
being
overnice
to
separate
what
s
element
from
what
s
convention
hastes
by
line
on
line
to
draw
you
out
a
world
without
your
help
indeed
unless
you
take
his
yoke
upon
you
and
will
learn
of
him
so
much
he
has
to
teach
so
good
a
world
the
same
the
whole
creation
s
groaning
for
no
rich
nor
poor
no
gain
nor
loss
nor
stint
no
potage
in
it
able
to
exclude
a
brother
s
birthright
and
no
right
of
birth
the
potage
secured
to
every
man
and

dealt
out
like
the
rest
gratuitously
with
the
soup
at
six
to
whoso
does
not
seek
softly
sir
i
interrupted
i
had
a
cousin
once
i
held
in
reverence
if
he
strained
too
wide
it
was
not
to
take
honour
but
give
help
the
gesture
was
heroic
if
his
hand
accomplished
nothing
well
it
is
not
proved
that
empty
hand
thrown
impotently
out
were
sooner
caught
i
think
by
one
in
heaven
than
many
a
hand
that
reaped
a
harvest
in
and
keeps
the
scythe
s
glow
on
it
pray
you
then
for
my
sake
merely
use
less
bitterness
in
speaking
of

he

aurora
when
the

beats
the
ass
the

he
shook

yet
to
mean
so
well
and
fail
so
foul
expresses
ne
er
another
beast
than
man
the
antithesis
is
human
harken
dear
there
s
too
much
abstract
willing
purposing
in
this
poor
world
we
talk
by
aggregates
and
think
by
systems
and
being
used
to
face
our
evils
in
statistics
are
inclined
to
cap
them
with
unreal
remedies
drawn
out
in
haste
on
the
other
side
the
that
s
true
i
answered
fain
to
throw
up
thought
and
make
a
game
of
t
oh
we
generalise
enough
to
please
you
if
we
pray
at
all
we
pray
no
longer
for
our
daily
bread
but
next
centenary
s
harvests
if
we
give
our
cup
of

not
tendered
till
we
lay
down
pipes
and
found

or

tis
the
same
a
woman
can
not
do
the
thing
she
ought
which
means
whatever
perfect
thing
she
can
in
life
in
art
in
science
but
she
fears
to
let
the
perfect
action
take
her
part

i
am
not

not

than

for

my
vain
phalanstery
dissolved
itself
my
men
and
women
of
disordered
lives
i
brought
in
orderly
to
dine
and
sleep
broke
up
those
waxen
masks
i
made
them
wear
with
fierce
contortions
of
the
natural
face
and
cursed
me
for
my
tyrannous
constraint
in
forcing
crooked
creatures
to
live
straight
and
set
the
country
hounds
upon
my
back
to
bite
and
tear
me
for
my
wicked
deed
of
trying
to
do
good
without
the
church
or
even
the
squires
aurora
do
you
mind
your
ancient
neighbours
the
great
teems
with
sketches
summaries
and
last
tracts
but
twelve
on
socialistic
troublers
of
close
bonds
betwixt
the
generous
rich
and
grateful
poor
the
vicar
preached
from
revelations
till
the
doctor
woke
and
found
me
with
the
frogs
on
three
successive
sundays
ay
and
stopped
to
weep
a
little
for
he
s
getting
old
that
such
perdition
should
o
ertake
a
man
of
such
fair
acres
the
parish
too
he
printed
his
discourses
by
request
and
if
your
book
shall
sell
as
his
did
then
your
verses
are
less
good
than
i
suppose
the
women
of
the
neighbourhood
subscribed
and
sent
me
a
copy
bound
in
scarlet
silk
tooled
edges
blazoned
with
the
arms
of
leigh
i
own
that
touched
what
the
pretty
ones
poor
romney
otherwise
the
effect
was
small
i
had
my
windows
broken
once
or
twice
by
liberal
peasants
naturally
incensed
at
such
a
vexer
of
arcadian
peace
who
would
not
let
men
call
their
wives
their
own
to
kick
like
britons
made
obstacles
when
things
went
smoothly
as
a
baby
drugged
toward
freedom
and
starvation
bringing
down
the
wicked
london
and
drabs
to
affront
the
blessed
hillside
drabs
and
thieves
with
mended
morals
quotha
new
lives
my
windows
paid
for
t
i
was
shot
at
once
by
an
active
poacher
who
had
hit
a
hare
from
the
other
barrel
tired
of
springeing
game
so
long
upon
my
acres
undisturbed
and
restless
for
the
country
s
virtue
yet
he
missed
me
and
pelted
very
oft
in
riding
through
the
village
there
he
goes
who
d
drive
away
our
christian
gentlefolks
to
catch
us
undefended
in
the
trap
he
baits
with
poisonous
cheese
and
lock
us
up
in
that
pernicious
prison
of
leigh
hall
with
all
his
murderers
give
another
name
and
say
leigh
hell
and
burn
it
up
with
and
so
they
did
at
last
did
you
never
heard
it
cousin
vincent
s
news
came
stinted
they
did
they
burnt
leigh
hall
you
re
sorry
dear
aurora
yes
indeed
they
did
it
perfectly
a
thorough
work
and
not
a
failure
this
time
let
us
grant
tis
somewhat
easier
though
to
burn
a
house
than
build
a
system
that
s
easy
too
in
a
dream
books
pictures
the
pictures
what
you
think
your
dear
vandykes
would
give
them
pause
our
proud
ancestral
leighs
with
those
peaked
beards
or
bosoms
white
as
foam
thrown
up
on
rocks
from
the
wave
such
calm
defiant
looks
they
flared
up
with
now
nevermore
they
ll
twit
the
bones
in
the
with
ugly
death
not
one
was
rescued
save
the
lady
maud
who
threw
you
down
that
morning
you
were
born
the
undeniable
lineal
mouth
and
chin
to
wear
for
ever
for
her
gracious
sake
for
which
good
deed
i
saved
her
the
rest
went
and
you
you
re
sorry
cousin
well
for
me
with
all
my
phalansterians
safely
out
poor
hearts
they
helped
the
burners
it
was
said
and
certainly
a
few
clapped
hands
and
yelled
the
ruin
did
not
hurt
me
as
it
might
as
when
for
instance
i
was
hurt
one
day
a
certain
letter
being
destroyed
in
fact
to
see
the
great
house
flare
so
oaken
floors
our
fathers
made
so
fine
with
rushes
once
before
our
mothers
furbished
them
with
trains
carved
wainscoats
panelled
walls
the
favourite
slide
for
draining
off
a
martyr
or
a
rogue
the
echoing
galleries
half
a
long
and
all
the
various
stairs
that
took
you
up
and
took
you
down
and
took
you
round
about
upon
their
slippery
darkness
recollect
all
helping
to
keep
up
one
blazing
jest
the
flames
through
all
the
casements
pushing
forth
like
devils
crinkled
into
snakes
all
signifying
look
you
romney
leigh
we
save
the
people
from
your
saving
here
yet
so
as
by
fire
we
make
a
pretty
show
besides
that
s
the
best
you
ve
ever
see
this
almost
moved
myself
to
clap
the
vale
et
plaude
came
too
with
effect
when
in
the
roof
fell
and
the
fire
that
paused
stunned
momently
beneath
the
stroke
of
slates
and
tumbling
rafters
rose
at
once
and
roared
and
wrapping
the
whole
house
which
disappeared
in
a
mounting
whirlwind
of
dilated
flame
blew
upward
straight
its
drift
of
fiery
chaff
in
the
face
of
heaven
which
blenched
and
ran
up
poor
romney
sometimes
when
i
dream
he
said
i
hear
the
silence
after
twas
so
still
for
all
those
wild
beasts
yelling
cursing
round
were
suddenly
silent
while
you
counted
five
so
silent
that
you
heard
a
young
bird
fall
from
the
in
the
neighbouring
rookery
through
edging
toward
the
light
the
old
rooks
had
already
fled
too
far
to
hear
the
screech
they
fled
with
though
you
saw
some
flying
on
still
like
scatterings
of
dead
leaves
in
seen
dark
against
the
sky
all
flying
like
the
house
of
dear
romney
evidently
twould
have
been
a
fine
sight
for
a
poet
sweet
like
you
to
make
the
verse
blaze
after
i
myself
even
i
felt
something
in
the
grand
old
trees
which
stood
that
moment
like
brute
druid
gods
amazed
upon
the
rim
of
ruin
where
as
into
a
blackened
socket
the
great
fire
had
dropped
throwing
up
splinters
now
and
then
to
show
them
grey
with
all
their
centuries
left
there
to
witness
that
on
such
a
day
the
house
went
ah
while
you
counted
five
i
seemed
to
feel
a
little
like
a
leigh
but
then
it
passed
aurora
a
child
cried
and
i
had
enough
to
think
of
what
to
do
with
all
those
houseless
wretches
in
the
dark
and
ponder
where
they
d
dance
the
next
time
they
who
had
burnt
the
did
you
think
of
that
who
burns
his
viol
will
not
dance
i
know
to
cymbals
o
my
sweet
sad
voice
he
cried
o
voice
that
speaks
and
overcomes
the
sun
is
silent
but
aurora
alas
i
said
i
speak
i
know
not
what
i
m
back
in
childhood
thinking
as
a
child
a
foolish
it
make
you
smile
i
shall
not
from
the
window
of
my
room
catch
sight
of
those
old
chimneys
any
no
more
he
answered
if
you
pushed
one
day
through
all
the
green
hills
to
our
fathers
house
you
d
come
upon
a
great
charred
circle
where
the
patient
earth
was
singed
an
acre
round
with
one
symbolic
of
my
life
ascending
winding
leading
up
to
nought
tis
worth
a
poet
s
seeing
will
you
go
i
made
no
answer
had
i
any
right
to
weep
with
this
man
that
i
dared
to
speak
a
woman
stood
between
his
soul
and
mine
and
waved
us
off
from
touching
evermore
with
those
unclean
white
hands
of
hers
enough
we
had
burnt
our
viols
and
were
silent
so
the
silence
lengthened
till
it
pressed
i
spoke
to
breathe
i
think
you
were
ill
more
ill
he
answered
had
been
scarcely
ill
i
hoped
this
feeble
fumbling
at
life
s
knot
might
end
concisely
i
failed
to
die
as
formerly
i
failed
to
live
thus
grew
willing
having
tried
all
other
ways
to
try
just
god
s
humility
s
so
good
when
pride
s
impossible
mark
us
how
we
make
our
virtues
cousin
from
our
sins
which
smack
of
them
from
henceforth
is
it
right
for
instance
to
wed
here
while
you
love
there
and
yet
because
a
man
sins
once
the
sin
cleaves
to
him
in
necessity
to
sin
that
if
he
sin
not
to
damn
himself
he
sins
to
damn
others
with
himself
and
thus
to
wed
here
loving
there
becomes
a
duty
virtue
buds
a
dubious
leaf
round
mortal
brows
your
ivy
s
better
dear
she
tis
certain
is
my
very
wife
the
very
lamb
left
mangled
by
the
wolves
through
my
own
bad
shepherding
and
could
i
choose
but
take
her
on
my
shoulder
past
this
stretch
of
rough
uneasy
wilderness
poor
lamb
poor
child
poor
child
my
belov
d
i
will
not
vex
you
any
more
but
having
spoken
what
i
came
to
say
the
rest
shall
please
you
what
she
can
in
me
protection
tender
liking
freedom
ease
she
shall
have
surely
liberally
for
her
and
hers
aurora
small
amends
they
ll
make
for
hideous
evils
which
she
had
not
known
except
by
me
and
for
this
imminent
loss
this
forfeit
presence
of
a
gracious
friend
which
also
she
must
forfeit
for
my
sake
since
drop
your
hand
in
mine
a
moment
sweet
we
re
parting
ah
my
snowdrop
what
a
touch
as
if
the
wind
had
swept
it
off
you
grudge
your
gelid
sweetness
on
my
palm
but
so
a
moment
angry
that
i
could
not
bear
speaking
breathing
living
side
by
side
with
some
one
called
my
wife
and
live
myself
nay
be
not
must
understand
your
lightest
footfall
on
a
floor
of
mine
would
shake
the
house
my
lintel
being
uncrossed
gainst
angels
henceforth
it
is
night
with
me
and
so
henceforth
i
put
the
shutters
up
auroras
must
not
come
to
spoil
my
he
smiled
so
feebly
with
an
empty
hand
stretched
sideway
from
me
indeed
he
looked
to
any
one
but
me
to
give
him
help
and
while
the
moon
came
suddenly
out
full
the
of
our
italian
moons
sufficient
plainly
for
the
heaven
and
earth
the
stars
struck
dumb
and
washed
away
in
dews
of
golden
glory
and
the
mountains
steeped
in
divine
languor
he
the
man
appeared
so
pale
and
patient
like
the
marble
man
a
sculptor
puts
his
personal
sadness
in
to
join
his
grandeur
of
ideal
thought
as
if
his
mallet
struck
me
from
my
height
of
passionate
indignation
i
who
had
risen
pale
paused
was
romney
mad
indeed
had
all
this
wrong
of
heart
made
sick
the
brain
then
quiet
with
a
sort
of
tremulous
pride
go
cousin
i
said
coldly
a
farewell
was
sooner
spoken
twixt
a
pair
of
friends
in
those
old
days
than
seems
to
suit
you
now
and
if
since
then
i
ve
writ
a
book
or
two
i
m
somewhat
dull
still
in
the
manly
art
of
phrase
and
metaphrase
why
any
man
can
carve
a
score
of
white
loves
out
of
snow
as
buonarroti
down
in
florence
there
and
set
them
on
the
wall
in
some
safe
shade
as
safe
sir
as
your
marriage
very
good
though
if
a
woman
took
one
from
the
ledge
to
put
it
on
the
table
by
her
flowers
and
let
it
mind
her
of
a
certain
friend
twould
drop
at
once
so
better
would
not
bear
her
even
where
she
took
it
up
a
little
tenderly
so
best
i
say
for
me
i
would
not
touch
so
light
a
thing
and
risk
to
spoil
it
half
an
hour
before
the
sun
shall
shine
to
melt
it
leave
it
there
i
m
plain
at
speech
direct
in
purpose
when
i
speak
you
ll
take
the
meaning
as
it
is
and
not
allow
for
puckerings
in
the
silks
by
clever
stitches
i
m
a
woman
sir
and
use
the
woman
s
figures
naturally
as
you
the
male
license
so
i
wish
you
well
i
m
simply
sorry
for
the
griefs
you
ve
and
not
for
your
sake
only
but
mankind
s
this
race
is
never
grateful
from
the
first
one
fills
their
cup
at
supper
with
pure
wine
which
back
they
give
at
on
a
sponge

you

from
this
thanklessness
of

no

relieved
of
moses

is

for

they
burnt

but
if
consummated
to
devils
heightened
beyond
lucifers
they
had
burnt
instead
a
star
or
two
of
those
we
saw
above
there
just
a
moment
back
before
the
moon
abolished
them
and
riddled
them
in
ashes
through
a
sieve
on
the

of

you
and
i
remained
still
you
and
i
it
would
not
shift
our
places
as
mere
friends
nor
render
decent
you
should
toss
a
phrase
beyond
the
point
of
actual
feeling
you
shall
not
interrupt
me
as
you
said
we
re
parting
certainly
not
once
or
twice
you
ve
mocked
me
somewhat
or
yourself
and
i
at
least
have
not
deserved
it
so
that
i
should
meet
it
unsurprised
but
now
enough
we
re
parting
parting
cousin
leigh
i
wish
you
well
through
all
the
acts
of
life
and
life
s
relations
wedlock
not
the
least
and
it
shall
please
me
in
your
words
to
know
you
yield
your
wife
protection
freedom
ease
and
very
tender
liking
may
you
live
so
happy
with
her
romney
that
your
friends
may
praise
her
for
it
meantime
some
of
us
are
wholly
dull
in
keeping
ignorant
of
what
she
has
suffered
by
you
and
what
debt
of
sorrow
your
rich
love
sits
down
to
pay
but
if
tis
sweet
for
love
to
pay
its
debt
tis
sweeter
still
for
love
to
give
its
gift
and
you
be
liberal
in
the
sweeter
way
you
can
i
think
at
least
as
touches
me
you
owe
her
cousin
romney
no
amends
she
is
not
used
to
hold
my
gown
so
fast
you
need
entreat
her
now
to
let
it
go
the
lady
never
was
a
friend
of
mine
nor
capable
thought
you
knew
as
much
of
losing
for
your
sake
so
poor
a
prize
as
such
a
worthless
friendship
be
content
good
cousin
therefore
both
for
her
and
you
i
ll
never
spoil
your
dark
nor
dull
your
noon
nor
vex
you
when
you
re
merry
nor
when
you
rest
you
shall
not
need
to
put
a
shutter
up
to
keep
out
this
aurora
ah
your
north
can
make
auroras
which
vex
nobody
scarce
known
from
evenings
also
let
me
say
my
larks
fly
higher
than
some
windows
right
you
ve
read
your
leighs
indeed
twould
shake
a
house
if
such
as
i
came
in
with
outstretched
hand
still
warm
and
thrilling
from
the
clasp
of
one
of
one
we
know
to
acknowledge
palm
to
palm
as
mistress
there
the
lady
now
god
be
with
us
with
a
sudden
clash
of
voice
he
what
name
s
that
you
spoke
a
name
pardon
me
i
would
that
romney
i
could
name
your
wife
nor
wound
you
yet
be
are
we
mad
he
wife
mine
lady
waldemar
i
think
you
said
my
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
threw
his
noble
head
back
toward
the
moon
as
one
who
swims
against
a
stormy
sea
and
laughed
with
such
a
helpless
hopeless
scorn
i
stood
and
trembled
may
god
judge
me
so
he
said
at
last
i
came
convicted
here
and
humbled
sorely
if
not
enough
i
came
because
this
woman
from
her
crystal
soul
had
shown
me
something
which
a
man
calls
light
because
too
formerly
i
sinned
by
her
as
then
and
ever
since
i
have
by
god
through
arrogance
of
nature
i
loved
whom
best
i
need
not
say
since
that
is
writ
too
plainly
in
the
book
of
my
misdeeds
and
thus
i
came
here
to
abase
myself
and
fasten
kneeling
on
her
regent
brows
a
garland
which
i
startled
thence
one
day
of
her
beautiful
but
here
again
i
m
baffled
in
my
abasement
as
my
aggrandisement
there
s
no
room
left
for
me
at
any
woman
s
foot
who
misconceives
my
nature
purpose
possible
actions
what
are
you
the
aurora
who
made
large
my
dreams
to
frame
your
greatness
you
conceive
so
small
you
stand
so
less
than
woman
through
being
more
and
lose
your
natural
instinct
like
a
beast
through
intellectual
culture
since
indeed
i
do
not
think
that
any
common
she
would
dare
adopt
such
for
the
legible
of
such
as
i
with
all
my
blots
with
all
my
blots
at
last
then
peerless
cousin
we
are
at
last
we
re
even
ah
you
ve
left
your
height
and
here
upon
my
level
we
take
hands
and
here
i
reach
you
to
forgive
you
sweet
and
that
s
a
fall
aurora
long
ago
you
seldom
understood
me
before
i
could
not
blame
you
then
you
only
seemed
so
high
above
you
could
not
see
below
but
now
i
breathe
now
i
pardon
we
re
parting
dearest
men
have
burnt
my
house
maligned
my
motives
not
one
i
swear
has
wronged
my
soul
as
this
aurora
has
who
called
the
lady
waldemar
my
not
married
to
her
yet
you
said
again
nay
read
the
lines
he
held
a
letter
out
she
sent
you
through
by
the
moonlight
there
i
tore
the
meaning
out
with
passionate
haste
much
rather
than
i
read
it
thus
it
ran
ninth
book
even
thus
i
pause
to
write
it
out
at
length
the
letter
of
the
lady
i
prayed
your
cousin
leigh
to
take
you
this
he
says
he
ll
do
it
after
years
of
love
or
what
is
called
so
a
woman
frets
and
fools
upon
one
string
of
a
man
s
name
and
fingers
it
for
ever
till
it
breaks
he
may
perhaps
do
for
her
such
a
thing
and
she
accept
it
without
detriment
although
she
should
not
love
him
any
more
and
i
who
do
not
love
him
nor
love
you
nor
you
aurora
you
shall
repent
your
most
ungracious
letter
and
confess
constrained
by
his
convictions
he
s
convinced
you
ve
wronged
me
foully
are
you
made
so
ill
you
impute
such
ill
to
we
both
had
mothers
in
their
bosom
once
why
after
all
i
thank
you
aurora
leigh
for
proving
to
myself
that
there
are
things
i
would
not
do
not
for
my
life
nor
him
though
something
i
have
somewhat
overdone
for
instance
when
i
went
to
see
the
gods
one
morning
on
olympus
with
a
step
that
shook
the
thunder
in
a
certain
cloud
committing
myself
vilely
could
i
think
the
muse
i
pulled
my
heart
out
from
my
breast
to
soften
had
herself
a
sort
of
heart
and
loved
my
mortal
he
at
least
loved
her
i
heard
him
say
so
twas
my
recompence
when
watching
at
his
bedside
fourteen
days
he
broke
out
ever
like
a
flame
at
whiles
between
the
heats
of
fever
is
it
thou
breathe
closer
sweetest
mouth
and
when
at
last
the
fever
gone
the
wasted
face
extinct
as
if
it
irked
him
much
to
know
me
there
he
said
twas
kind
twas
good
twas
womanly
and
fifty
praises
to
excuse
one
love
but
was
the
picture
safe
he
had
ventured
for
and
then
half
wandering
i
have
loved
her
well
although
she
could
not
love
say
instead
i
answered
that
she
loves
twas
my
turn
to
rave
i
would
have
married
him
so
changed
although
the
world
had
jeered
me
properly
for
taking
up
with
cupid
at
his
worst
the
silver
quiver
worn
off
on
his
hair
no
no
he
murmured
no
she
loves
me
not
aurora
leigh
does
better
bring
her
book
and
read
it
softly
lady
waldemar
until
i
thank
your
friendship
more
for
that
than
even
for
harder
so
i
read
your
book
aurora
for
an
hour
that
day
i
kept
its
pauses
marked
its
emphasis
my
voice
empaled
upon
rhyme
s
golden
hooks
not
once
would
writhe
nor
quiver
nor
revolt
i
read
on
calmly
shut
it
up
observing
there
s
some
merit
in
the
book
and
yet
the
merit
in
t
is
thrown
away
as
chances
still
with
women
if
we
write
or
write
not
we
want
string
to
tie
our
flowers
so
drop
them
as
we
walk
which
serves
to
show
the
way
we
went
good
morning
mister
leigh
you
ll
find
another
reader
the
next
time
a
woman
who
does
better
than
to
love
i
hate
she
will
do
nothing
very
well
male
poets
are
preferable
tiring
less
and
teaching
i
triumphed
o
er
you
both
and
left
him
when
i
saw
him
afterward
i
had
read
your
shameful
letter
and
my
heart
he
came
with
health
recovered
strong
though
pale
lord
howe
and
he
a
courteous
pair
of
friends
to
say
what
men
dare
say
to
women
when
their
debtors
but
i
stopped
them
with
a
word
and
proved
i
had
never
trodden
such
a
road
to
carry
so
much
dirt
upon
my
shoe
then
putting
into
it
something
of
disdain
i
asked
forsooth
his
pardon
and
my
own
for
having
done
no
better
than
to
love
and
that
not
wisely
twas
long
ago
and
though
twas
altered
perfectly
since
then
i
told
him
as
i
tell
you
now
miss
leigh
and
proved
i
took
some
trouble
for
his
sake
because
i
knew
he
did
not
love
the
girl
to
spoil
my
hands
with
working
in
the
stream
of
that
poor
bubbling
nature
she
went
consigned
to
one
i
trusted
my
own
maid
who
once
had
lived
full
five
months
in
my
house
dressed
hair
superbly
with
a
lavish
purse
to
carry
to
australia
where
she
had
left
a
husband
said
she
if
the
creature
lied
the
mission
failed
we
all
do
fail
and
lie
more
or
i
m
is
all
expected
from
us
when
we
fail
the
most
and
go
to
church
to
own
it
what
i
meant
was
just
the
best
for
him
and
me
and
her
best
even
for
marian
am
sorry
for
t
and
very
sorry
yet
my
creature
said
she
saw
her
stop
to
speak
in
oxford
street
to
one
no
matter
i
had
sooner
cut
my
hand
off
though
twere
kissed
the
hour
before
and
promised
a
pearl
for
the
next
than
crush
her
silly
head
with
so
much
wrong
poor
child
i
would
have
mended
it
with
gold
until
it
gleamed
like
sophia
s
dome
when
all
the
faithful
troop
to
morning
prayer
but
he
he
nipped
the
bud
of
such
a
thought
with
that
cold
leigh
look
which
i
fancied
once
and
broke
in
henceforth
she
was
called
his
wife
his
wife
required
no
succour
he
was
bound
to
florence
to
resume
this
broken
bond
enough
so
both
were
happy
he
and
howe
to
acquit
me
of
the
heaviest
charge
of
which
i
shot
my
tongue
against
my
fly
and
struck
him
would
he
carry
was
just
a
letter
from
me
to
aurora
leigh
and
ratify
from
his
authentic
mouth
my
answer
to
her
accusation
yes
if
such
a
letter
were
prepared
in
s
just
your
cousin
abhorrently
he
d
wash
his
hands
in
blood
to
keep
them
clean
and
so
cold
courteous
a
mere
gentleman
he
bowed
we
parted
parted
face
no
more
voice
no
more
love
no
more
wiped
wholly
out
like
some
ill
scholar
s
scrawl
from
heart
and
slate
ay
spit
on
and
so
wiped
out
utterly
by
some
coarse
scholar
i
have
been
too
coarse
too
human
have
we
business
in
our
rank
with
blood
i
the
veins
i
will
have
henceforth
none
not
even
to
keep
the
colour
at
my
lip
a
rose
is
pink
and
pretty
without
blood
why
not
a
woman
when
we
ve
played
in
vain
the
game
to
adore
have
resources
still
and
can
play
on
at
leisure

adored

already
swearing
at
my
feet
that
i
m
the
typic
she
away
with

smith

of
leigh
henceforth
i
ll
admit
no
socialist
within
three
crinolines
to
live
and
have

being
but
for
you
though
insolent
your
letter
and
absurd
and
though
i
hate
you
frankly
my
smith
for
when
you
have
seen
this
famous
marriage
tied
a
most
unspotted
erle
to
a
noble
leigh
his
love
astray
on
one
he
should
not
love
howbeit
you
should
not
want
his
love

want
some
comfort
so
i
leave
you

somewhat
worse
adopts
a
thought
of
leigh
s
and
dwindles
it
goes
leagues
beyond
to
be
no
inch
behind
will
mind
you
of
him
as
a
may
of
a
man
and
women
when
they
are
made
like
you
grow
tender
to
a
footprint
even
adore
averted
shoulders
in
a
glass
and
memories
of
what
present
once
was
loathed
and
yet
you
loathed
not
romney
you
ve
played
at
fox
and
goose
about
him
with
your
soul
pass
over
fox
you
rub
out
fox
a
feeling
you
eradicate
it
act
s
identical
i
wish
you
joy
miss
leigh
you
ve
made
a
happy
marriage
for
your
friend
and
all
the
honour
love
derives
from
you
who
love
him
whom
he
loves
you
need
not
wish
joy
to
think
of
it
i
have
so
much
observe
aurora
leigh
your
droop
of
eyelid
is
the
same
as
his
and
but
for
you
i
might
have
won
his
love
and
to
you
i
have
shown
my
naked
heart
for
which
three
things
i
hate
hate
hate
you
hush
suppose
a
fourth
can
not
choose
but
think
that
with
him
i
were
virtuouser
than
you
without
him
so
i
hate
you
from
this
gulf
and
hollow
of
my
soul
which
opens
out
to
what
except
for
you
had
been
my
heaven
and
is
instead
a
place
to
curse
by
an
active
kind
of
curse
i
stood
there
confounded
i
had
seized
and
caught
the
sense
of
the
letter
with
its
twenty
stinging
snakes
in
a
moment
s
sweep
of
eyesight
and
i
stood
ah
you
mistake
he
said
i
m
married
is
not
marian
erle
my
wife
as
god
sees
things
i
have
a
wife
and
child
and
i
as
i
m
a
man
who
honours
god
am
here
to
claim
them
as
my
child
and
i
felt
it
hard
to
breathe
much
less
to
speak
nor
word
of
mine
was
needed
some
one
else
was
there
for
answering
romney
she
began
my
great
good
angel
then
at
first
i
knew
that
marian
erle
was
beautiful
she
stood
there
still
and
pallid
as
a
saint
dilated
like
a
saint
in
ecstasy
as
if
the
floating
moonshine
interposed
betwixt
her
foot
and
the
earth
and
raised
her
up
to
float
upon
it
i
had
left
my
child
who
sleeps
she
said
and
having
drawn
this
way
i
heard
you
speaking
friend
me
now
you
take
this
marian
such
as
wicked
men
have
made
her
for
your
honourable
wife
the
thrilling
solemn
proud
pathetic
voice
he
stretched
his
arms
out
toward
the
thrilling
voice
as
if
to
draw
it
on
to
his
embrace
i
take
her
as
god
made
her
and
as
men
must
fail
to
unmake
her
for
my
honoured
she
never
raised
her
eyes
nor
took
a
step
but
stood
there
in
her
place
and
spoke
again
you
take
this
marian
s
child
which
is
her
shame
in
sight
of
men
and
women
for
your
child
of
whom
you
will
not
ever
feel
ashamed
the
thrilling
tender
proud
pathetic
voice
he
stepped
on
toward
it
still
with
outstretched
arms
as
if
to
quench
upon
his
breast
that
voice
may
god
so
father
me
as
i
do
him
and
so
forsake
me
as
i
let
him
feel
he
s
orphaned
haply
here
i
take
the
child
to
share
my
cup
to
slumber
on
my
knee
to
play
his
loudest
gambol
at
my
foot
to
hold
my
finger
in
the
public
ways
till
none
shall
need
inquire
whose
child
is
this
the
gesture
saying
so
tenderly
my
own
she
stood
a
moment
silent
in
her
place
then
turning
toward
me
very
slow
and
and
you
say
you
you
blame
me
much
if
careful
for
that
outcast
child
of
mine
i
catch
this
hand
that
s
stretched
to
me
and
him
nor
dare
to
leave
him
friendless
in
the
world
where
men
have
stoned
me
have
i
not
the
right
to
take
so
mere
an
aftermath
from
life
else
found
so
wholly
bare
or
is
it
wrong
to
let
your
cousin
for
a
generous
bent
put
out
his
ungloved
fingers
among
briars
to
set
a
tumbling
bird
somewhat
straight
you
will
not
tell
him
though
we
re
innocent
we
are
not
harmless
and
that
both
our
harms
will
stick
to
his
good
smooth
noble
life
like
burrs
never
to
drop
off
though
you
shake
the
cloak
you
ve
been
my
friend
you
will
not
now
be
his
you
ve
known
him
that
he
s
worthy
of
a
friend
and
you
re
his
cousin
lady
after
all
and
therefore
more
than
free
to
take
his
part
explaining
since
the
nest
is
surely
spoilt
and
marian
what
you
know
her
a
wife
the
world
would
hardly
understand
her
case
of
being
just
hurt
and
honest
while
for
him
twould
ever
twit
him
with
his
bastard
child
and
married
harlot
speak
while
yet
there
s
time
you
would
not
stand
and
let
a
good
man
s
dog
turn
round
and
rend
him
because
his
and
reared
of
a
generous
breed
will
you
let
his
act
because
it
s
generous
speak
i
m
bound
to
you
and
i
ll
be
bound
by
only
you
in
the
thrilling
solemn
voice
so
passionless
sustained
yet
low
without
a
rise
or
fall
as
one
who
had
authority
to
speak
and
not
as
marian
i
looked
up
to
feel
if
god
stood
near
me
and
beheld
his
heaven
as
blue
as
aaron
s
priestly
robe
appeared
to
aaron
when
he
took
it
off
to
die
and
then
i
accept
the
gift
i
say
my
sister
marian
and
be
satisfied
the
hand
that
gives
has
still
a
soul
behind
which
will
not
let
it
quail
for
having
given
though
foolish
worldlings
talk
they
know
not
what
of
what
they
know
not
romney
s
strong
enough
for
this
do
you
be
strong
to
know
he
s
strong
he
stands
on
right
s
side
never
flinch
for
him
as
if
he
stood
on
the
other
you
ll
be
bound
by
me
i
am
a
woman
of
repute
no
gossip
ever
specked
my
life
my
name
is
clean
and
open
as
this
hand
whose
glove
there
s
not
a
man
dares
blab
about
as
if
he
had
touched
it
freely
s
my
hand
to
clasp
your
hand
my
marian
owned
as
pure
as
pure
i
m
a
woman
and
a
leigh
and
as
i
m
both
i
ll
witness
to
the
world
that
romney
leigh
is
honoured
in
his
choice
who
chooses
marian
for
his
honoured
her
broad
wild
woodland
eyes
shot
out
a
light
her
smile
was
wonderful
for
rapture
thanks
my
great
forward
then
she
sprang
and
dropping
her
impassioned
spaniel
head
with
all
its
brown
abandonment
of
curls
on
romney
s
feet
we
heard
the
kisses
drawn
through
sobs
upon
the
foot
upon
the
o
romney
o
my
angel
o
unchanged
though
since
we
ve
parted
i
have
past
the
grave
but
death
itself
could
only
better
not
change
thee
i
do
not
thank
at
all
i
but
thank
god
who
made
thee
what
thou
art
so
wholly
when
he
tried
in
vain
to
raise
her
to
his
embrace
escaping
thence
as
any
leaping
fawn
from
a
huntsman
s
grasp
she
bounded
off
and
lighted
beyond
reach
before
him
with
a
staglike
majesty
of
soft
serene
defiance
she
knew
he
could
not
touch
her
so
was
tolerant
he
had
cared
to
try
she
stood
there
with
her
great
drowned
eyes
and
dripping
cheeks
and
strange
sweet
smile
that
lived
through
all
as
if
one
held
a
light
across
a
waste
of
waters
her
head
to
keep
some
thoughts
down
deeper
in
her
soul
then
white
and
tranquil
as
a
which
having
rained
itself
to
a
tardy
peace
stands
still
in
heaven
as
if
it
ruled
the
day
spoke
out
although
my
generous
friend
since
last
we
met
and
parted
you
re
unchanged
and
having
promised
faith
to
marian
erle
maintain
it
as
she
were
not
changed
at
all
and
though
that
s
worthy
though
that
s
full
of
balm
to
any
conscious
spirit
of
a
girl
who
once
has
loved
you
as
i
loved
you
once
yet
still
it
will
not
make
her
if
she
s
dead
and
gone
away
where
none
can
give
or
take
in
marriage
to
revive
return
and
wed
you
it
romney
here
s
the
point
o
friend
we
ll
see
it
plainer
you
and
i
must
never
never
never
join
hands
so
nay
let
me
say
it
i
said
it
first
to
god
and
placed
it
rounded
to
an
oath
far
far
above
the
moon
there
at
his
feet
as
surely
as
i
wept
just
now
at
yours
we
never
never
never
join
hands
so
and
now
be
patient
with
me
do
not
think
i
m
speaking
from
a
false
humility
the
truth
is
i
am
grown
so
proud
with
grief
and
he
has
said
so
often
through
his
nights
and
through
his
mornings
weep
a
little
still
thou
foolish
marian
because
women
must
but
do
not
blush
at
all
except
for
sin
that
i
who
felt
myself
unworthy
once
of
virtuous
romney
and
his
race
have
come
to
learn
a
woman
poor
or
rich
despised
or
honoured
is
a
human
soul
and
what
her
soul
is
she
is
herself
although
she
should
be
spit
upon
of
men
as
is
the
pavement
of
the
churches
here
still
good
enough
to
pray
in
and
being
chaste
and
honest
and
inclined
to
do
the
right
and
love
the
truth
and
live
my
life
out
green
and
smooth
beneath
his
steps
i
should
not
fear
to
make
him
thus
a
less
uneasy
time
than
many
a
happier
woman
very
proud
you
see
me
pardon
that
i
set
a
trap
to
hear
a
confirmation
in
your
voice
both
yours
and
yours
it
is
so
good
to
know
twas
really
god
who
said
the
same
before
for
thus
it
is
in
heaven
that
first
god
speaks
and
then
his
angels
oh
it
does
me
good
it
wipes
me
clean
and
sweet
from
devil
s
dirt
that
romney
leigh
should
think
me
worthy
still
of
being
his
true
and
honourable
wife
henceforth
i
need
not
say
on
leaving
earth
i
had
no
glory
in
it
for
the
rest
the
reason
s
ready
master
angel
friend
be
patient
with
me
wherefore
you
and
i
can
never
never
never
join
hands
so
i
know
you
ll
not
be
angry
like
a
man
for
are
none
when
i
shall
tell
the
truth
which
is
i
do
not
love
you
romney
leigh
i
do
not
love
you
ah
well
catch
my
hands
miss
leigh
and
burn
into
my
eyes
with
yours
i
swear
i
do
not
love
him
did
i
once
tis
said
that
women
have
been
bruised
to
death
and
yet
if
once
they
loved
that
love
of
theirs
could
never
be
drained
out
with
all
their
blood
i
ve
heard
such
things
and
pondered
did
i
indeed
love
once
or
did
i
only
worship
yes
perhaps
o
friend
i
set
you
up
so
high
above
all
actual
good
or
hope
of
good
or
fear
of
evil
all
that
could
be
mine
i
haply
set
you
above
love
itself
and
out
of
reach
of
these
poor
woman
s
arms
angelic
romney
what
was
in
my
thought
to
be
your
slave
your
help
your
toy
your
tool
to
be
your
love
i
never
thought
of
that
to
give
you
love
still
less
i
gave
you
love
i
think
i
did
not
give
you
anything
i
was
but
only
yours
my
knees
all
yours
in
soul
and
body
in
head
and
heart
a
creature
you
had
taken
from
the
ground
still
crumbling
through
your
fingers
to
your
feet
to
join
the
dust
she
came
from
did
i
love
or
did
i
worship
judge
aurora
leigh
but
if
indeed
i
loved
twas
long
ago
so
long
before
the
sun
and
moon
were
made
before
the
hells
were
open
before
i
heard
my
child
cry
in
the
desert
night
and
knew
he
had
no
father
it
may
be
i
m
not
as
strong
as
other
women
are
who
torn
and
crushed
are
not
undone
from
love
it
may
be
i
am
colder
than
the
dead
who
being
dead
love
always
but
for
me
once
killed
this
ghost
of
marian
loves
no
more
no
more
except
the
child
no
more
at
all
i
told
your
cousin
sir
that
i
was
dead
and
now
she
thinks
i
ll
get
up
from
my
grave
and
wear
my
for
a
and
glide
along
the
churchyard
like
a
bride
while
all
the
dead
keep
whispering
through
the
withes
you
would
be
better
in
your
place
with
us
you
pitiful
corruption
at
the
thought
the
damps
break
out
on
me
like
leprosy
although
i
m
clean
ay
clean
as
marian
erle
as
marian
leigh
i
know
i
were
not
clean
i
have
not
so
much
life
that
i
should
love
except
the
child
ah
god
i
could
not
bear
to
see
my
darling
on
a
good
man
s
knees
and
know
by
such
a
look
or
such
a
sigh
or
such
a
silence
that
he
thought
sometimes
this
child
was
fathered
by
some
cursed
wretch
for
romney
are
less
than
god
and
mothers
even
would
think
what
think
never
he
is
ours
the
child
and
we
would
sooner
vex
a
soul
in
heaven
by
coupling
with
it
the
dead
body
s
thought
it
left
behind
it
in
a
last
month
s
grave
than
in
my
child
see
other
than
my
child
we
only
never
call
him
fatherless
who
has
god
and
his
mother
o
my
babe
my
pretty
pretty
blossom
an
once
blew
upon
my
breast
can
any
think
i
d
have
another
called
happier
a
fathered
child
with
father
s
love
and
race
that
s
worn
as
bold
and
open
as
a
smile
to
vex
my
darling
when
he
s
asked
his
name
and
has
no
answer
what
a
happier
child
than
mine
my
best
laughed
so
loud
he
could
not
sleep
for
pastime
nay
i
swear
by
life
and
love
that
if
i
lived
like
some
and
loved
like
ay
loved
you
romney
leigh
as
some
love
eyes
that
have
wept
so
much
see
clear
i
ve
room
for
no
more
children
in
my
arms
my
kisses
are
all
melted
on
one
mouth
i
would
not
push
my
darling
to
a
stool
to
dandle
babies
here
s
a
hand
shall
keep
for
ever
clean
without
a
to
tend
my
boy
until
he
cease
to
need
one
steadying
finger
of
it
and
desert
not
miss
his
mother
s
lap
to
sit
with
men
and
when
i
miss
him
not
he
me
i
ll
come
and
say
now
give
me
some
of
romney
s
work
to
help
your
outcast
orphans
of
the
world
and
comfort
grief
with
for
you
meantime
most
noble
romney
wed
a
noble
wife
and
open
on
each
other
your
great
souls
i
need
not
farther
bless
you
if
i
dared
but
strain
and
touch
her
in
her
upper
sphere
and
say
come
down
to
my
debt
i
should
be
joyful
with
the
stream
of
joy
sent
through
me
but
the
moon
is
in
my
face
i
dare
not
i
guess
the
name
he
loves
i
m
learned
with
my
studies
of
old
days
remembering
how
he
crushed
his
when
some
one
came
and
spoke
or
did
not
come
aurora
i
could
touch
her
with
my
hand
and
fly
because
i
dare
she
was
gone
he
smiled
so
sternly
that
i
spoke
in
haste
forgive
sees
clearly
for
herself
her
instinct
s
holy
forgive
he
said
i
only
marvel
how
she
sees
so
sure
while
others
there
he
paused
hoarse
abrupt
aurora
you
forgive
us
her
and
me
for
her
the
thing
she
sees
poor
loyal
child
if
once
corrected
by
the
thing
i
know
had
been
unspoken
since
she
loves
you
well
has
leave
to
love
you
for
me
alas
if
once
or
twice
i
let
my
heart
escape
this
night
remember
where
hearts
slip
and
fall
they
break
beside
we
re
parting
you
do
not
love
that
you
should
surely
know
what
that
word
means
forgive
be
tolerant
it
had
not
been
but
that
i
felt
myself
so
safe
in
impuissance
and
despair
i
could
not
hurt
you
though
i
tossed
my
arms
and
sighed
my
soul
out
the
most
utter
wretch
will
choose
his
postures
when
he
comes
to
die
however
in
the
presence
of
a
queen
and
you
ll
forgive
me
some
unseemly
spasms
which
meant
no
more
than
dying
do
you
think
i
had
ever
come
here
in
my
perfect
mind
unless
i
had
come
here
in
my
settled
mind

to
keep
the
bond
and
give
my
name
my
house

things
i
could
to
marian
for
even
could
give
as
much
even
i
affronting
her
exalted
soul
by
a
supposition
that
she
wanted
these
could
act

and

up
to
creak
i
the
wind
and
drive
the
off
from

fill

to
fight
the
rats
of
our
society
without
this
romney
i
can
see
it
at
last
and
here
is
ended
my
pretension
which
the
most
pretended
of
course
even
so
not
so
stupid
blind
that
i
whom
thus
the
great
taskmaster
of
the
world
has
set
to
meditate
mistaken
work
my
dreary
face
against
a
dim
blank
wall
throughout
man
s
natural
lifetime
pretend
or
wish
o
love
i
have
loved
you
o
my
soul
i
have
lost
you
i
swear
by
all
yourself
and
all
you
might
have
been
to
me
these
years
if
that
had
not
failed
my
hope
i
m
not
so
bestial
to
regret
that
day
this
night
night
which
still
to
you
is
fair
nay
not
so
blind
aurora
i
attest
those
stars
above
us
which
i
can
not
see
you
can
not
that
if
heaven
itself
should
stoop
remix
the
lots
and
give
me
another
chance
i
d
say
no
other
d
record
my
blank
aurora
never
should
be
wife
of
not
see
the
stars
tis
worse
still
not
to
see
to
find
your
hand
although
we
re
parting
dear
a
moment
let
me
hold
it
ere
we
part
and
understand
my
last
at
last
i
would
not
have
you
thinking
when
i
m
gone
that
romney
dared
to
hanker
for
your
love
in
thought
or
vision
if
attainable
which
certainly
for
me
it
never
was
and
wish
to
use
it
for
a
dog
to
help
the
blind
man
stumbling
god
forbid
and
now
i
know
he
held
you
in
his
palm
and
kept
you
to
all
my
faults
to
save
you
at
last
from
such
a
dreary
end
believe
me
dear
that
if
i
had
known
like
him
what
loss
was
coming
on
me
i
had
done
as
well
in
this
as
he
you
who
are
still
my
light
how
late
it
is
i
know
that
now
you
ve
been
too
patient
sweet
i
will
but
blow
my
whistle
toward
the
lane
and
some
one
comes
the
same
who
brought
me
here
get
a
moment
heavenly
christ
a
moment
speak
once
romney
tis
not
true
i
hold
your
hands
i
look
into
your
you
see
me
no
more
than
the
blessed
stars
be
blessed
too
aurora
ah
my
sweet
you
tremble
do
you
mind
of
yore
dear
how
you
used
to
cheat
old
john
and
let
the
mice
out
slily
from
his
traps
until
he
marvelled
at
the
soul
in
mice
which
took
the
cheese
and
left
the
snare
the
same
dear
soft
heart
always
twas
for
this
i
grieved
howe
s
letter
never
reached
you
ah
you
had
heard
of
illness
the
issue
not
the
extent
my
life
long
sick
with
tossings
up
and
down
the
sudden
revulsion
in
the
blazing
house
the
strain
and
struggle
both
of
body
and
soul
which
left
fire
running
in
my
veins
for
blood
scarce
lacked
that
thunderbolt
of
the
falling
beam
which
nicked
me
on
the
forehead
as
i
passed
the
with
a
burden
say
heaven
s
bolt
not
william
erie
s
not
marian
s
father
s
tramp
and
poacher
whom
i
found
for
what
he
was
and
eager
for
her
sake
to
rescue
him
forth
swept
from
the
open
highway
of
the
world
and
all
like
a
woodland
boar
most
naturally
unwilling
to
be
tamed
he
notched
me
with
his
tooth
but
not
a
word
to
marian
and
i
do
not
think
besides
he
turned
the
tilting
of
the
beam
my
way
and
if
he
laughed
as
many
swear
poor
wretch
nor
he
nor
i
supposed
the
hurt
so
deep
we
ll
hope
his
next
laugh
may
be
merrier
in
a
better
blind
romney
ah
my
friend
you
ll
learn
to
say
it
in
a
cheerful
voice
i
too
at
first
desponded
to
be
blind
turned
out
of
nature
mulcted
as
a
man
refused
the
daily
largesse
of
the
sun
to
humble
creatures
when
the
fever
s
heat
dropped
from
me
as
the
flame
did
from
my
house
and
left
me
ruined
like
it
stripped
of
all
the
hues
and
shapes
of
aspectable
life
a
mere
bare
blind
stone
in
the
blaze
of
day
a
man
upon
the
outside
of
the
earth
as
dark
as
ten
feet
under
in
the
grave
why
that
seemed
no
hope
a
tear
you
weep
divine
aurora
tears
upon
my
hand
i
ve
seen
you
weeping
for
a
mouse
a
bird
but
weep
for
me
aurora
yes
there
s
hope
not
hope
of
sight
could
be
learned
dear
and
tell
you
in
what
greek
and
latin
name
the
visual
nerve
is
withered
to
the
root
though
the
outer
eyes
appear
indifferent
unspotted
in
their
chrystals
but
there
s
hope
the
spirit
from
behind
this
dethroned
sense
sees
waits
in
patience
till
the
walls
break
up
from
which
the
and
fresco
have
dropt
there
s
hope
the
man
here
once
so
arrogant
and
restless
so
ambitious
for
his
part
of
dealing
with
statistically
packed
disorders
from
a
pattern
on
his
nail
and
packing
such
things
quite
another
way
is
now
contented
from
his
personal
loss
he
has
come
to
hope
for
others
when
they
lose
and
wear
a
gladder
faith
in
what
we
gain
through
bitter
experience
compensation
sweet
like
that
tear
sweetest
i
am
quiet
now
as
tender
surely
for
the
suffering
world
but
quiet
at
the
wall
to
learn
content
henceforth
to
do
the
thing
i
can
for
though
as
powerless
said
i
as
a
stone
a
stone
can
still
give
shelter
to
a
worm
and
it
is
worth
while
being
a
stone
for
that
there
s
hope
is
there
hope
for
me
for
me
is
there
room
beneath
the
stone
for
such
a
worm
if
i
came
and
said
what
all
this
weeping
scarce
will
let
me
say
and
yet
what
women
can
not
say
at
all
but
weeping
bitterly
the
pride
keeps
up
until
the
heart
breaks
under
it
i
love
i
love
you
romney
silence
he
exclaimed
a
woman
s
pity
sometimes
makes
her
mad
a
man
s
distraction
must
not
cheat
his
soul
to
take
advantage
of
it
yet
tis
farewell
but
i
love
you
sir
and
when
a
woman
says
she
loves
a
man
the
man
must
hear
her
though
he
love
her
not
which
hush
he
has
leave
to
answer
in
his
turn
she
will
not
surely
blame
him
as
for
me
you
call
it
pity
i
m
generous
twere
somewhat
easier
for
a
woman
proud
as
i
am
and
i
m
very
vilely
proud
to
let
it
pass
as
such
and
press
on
you
love
born
of
pity
that
excellent
loves
are
born
so
often
nor
the
quicklier
die
and
this
would
set
me
higher
by
the
head
than
now
i
stand
no
matter
let
the
truth
stand
high
aurora
must
be
humble
no
my
love
s
not
pity
merely
obviously
i
m
not
a
generous
woman
never
was
or
else
of
old
i
had
not
looked
so
near
to
weights
and
measures
grudging
you
the
power
to
give
as
first
i
scorned
your
power
to
judge
for
me
aurora
i
would
have
no
gifts
forsooth
but
god
s
i
would
use
too
according
to
my
pleasure
and
my
choice
as
he
and
i
were
equals
below
excluded
from
that
level
of
interchange
admitting
benefaction
you
were
wrong
in
much
you
said
so
i
was
wrong
in
most
oh
most
you
only
thought
to
rescue
men
by
seeing
half
their
wants
while
thinking
nothing
of
your
personal
gain
but
i
who
saw
the
human
nature
broad
at
both
sides
comprehending
too
the
soul
s
and
all
the
high
necessities
of
art
betrayed
the
thing
i
saw
and
wronged
my
own
life
for
which
i
pleaded
passioned
to
exalt
the
artist
s
instinct
in
me
at
the
cost
of
putting
down
the
woman
s
forgot
no
perfect
artist
is
developed
here
from
any
imperfect
woman
flower
from
root
and
spiritual
from
natural
grade
by
grade
in
all
our
life
a
handful
of
the
earth
to
make
god
s
image
the
despised
poor
earth
the
healthy
odorous
earth
missed
with
it
the
divine
breath
that
blows
the
nostrils
out
to
ineffable
inflatus
ay
the
breath
which
love
is
art
is
much
but
love
is
more
o
art
my
art
thou
rt
much
but
love
is
more

symbolises
heaven
but
love
is
god
and
makes
heaven
i
aurora
fell
from
mine
i
would
not
be
a
woman
like
the
rest
a
simple
woman
who
believes
in
love
and
owns
the
right
of
love
because
she
loves
and
hearing
she
s
beloved
is
satisfied
with
what
contents
god
i
must
analyse
confront
and
question
just
as
if
a
fly
refused
to
warm
itself
in
any
sun
till
such
was
i
must
fret
forsooth
because
the
month
was
only
may
be
faithless
of
the
kind
of
proffered
love
and
captious
lest
it
miss
my
dignity
and
scornful
that
my
lover
sought
a
wife
to
use
to
use
o
romney
o
my
love
i
am
changed
since
then
changed
wholly
indeed
if
now
you
d
stoop
so
low
to
take
my
love
and
use
it
roughly
without
stint
or
spare
as
men
use
common
things
with
more
behind
and
in
this
ever
would
be
more
behind
to
any
mean
and
ordinary
end
the
joy
would
set
me
like
a
star
in
heaven
so
high
up
i
should
shine
because
of
height
and
not
of
virtue
yet
in
one
respect
just
one
beloved
i
am
in
no
wise
changed
i
love
you
loved
you
loved
you
first
and
last
and
love
you
on
for
ever
now
i
know
i
loved
you
always
romney
she
who
died
knew
that
and
said
so
lady
waldemar
knows
that
and
marian
i
had
known
the
same
except
that
i
was
prouder
than
i
knew
and
not
so
honest
ay
and
as
i
live
i
should
have
died
so
crushing
in
my
hand
this
rose
of
love
the
wasp
inside
and
all
ignoring
ever
to
my
soul
and
you
both
rose
and
pain
for
this
great
loss
this
great
despair
stand
before
your
face
and
know
i
can
not
win
a
look
of
yours
you
think
perhaps
i
am
not
changed
from
pride
and
that
i
chiefly
bear
to
say
such
words
because
you
can
not
shame
me
with
your
eyes
o
calm
grand
eyes
extinguished
in
a
storm
blown
out
like
lights
o
er
melancholy
seas
though
shrieked
for
by
the
shipwrecked
my
dark
my
cloud
go
before
me
every
day
while
i
go
ever
toward
the
wilderness
i
would
that
you
could
see
me
bare
to
the
soul
if
this
be
pity
tis
so
for
myself
and
not
for
romney
can
stand
alone
a
man
like
is
never
overcome
no
woman
like
me
counts
him
pitiable
while
saints
applaud
him
he
mistook
the
world
but
i
mistook
my
own
heart
that
slip
was
fatal
romney
you
leave
me
here
so
wrong
so
proud
so
weak
so
unconsoled
so
mere
a
woman
i
love
you
so
i
love
you
could
i
see
his
face
i
wept
so
did
i
drop
against
his
breast
or
did
his
arms
constrain
me
were
my
cheeks
hot
overflooded
with
my
tears
or
his
and
which
of
our
two
large
explosive
hearts
so
shook
me
that
i
know
not
there
were
words
that
broke
in
utterance
melted
in
the
fire
embrace
that
was
convulsion
then
a
kiss
as
long
and
silent
as
the
ecstatic
night
deep
deep
shuddering
breaths
which
meant
beyond
whatever
could
be
told
by
word
or
kiss
but
what
he
said
i
have
written
day
by
day
with
somewhat
even
writing
did
i
think
that
such
a
passionate
rain
would
intercept
and
dash
this
last
page
what
he
said
indeed
i
fain
would
write
it
down
here
like
the
rest
to
keep
it
in
my
eyes
as
in
my
ears
the
heart
s
sweet
scripture
to
be
read
at
night
when
weary
or
at
morning
when
afraid
and
lean
my
heaviest
oath
on
when
i
swear
that
when
all
s
done
all
tried
all
counted
here
all
great
arts
and
all
good
philosophies
this
love
just
puts
its
hand
out
in
a
dream
and
straight
outreaches
all
things
what
he
said
i
fain
would
write
but
if
an
angel
spoke
in
thunder
should
we
haply
know
much
more
than
that
it
thundered
if
a
cloud
came
down
and
wrapt
us
wholly
could
we
draw
its
shape
as
if
on
the
outside
and
not
overcome
and
so
he
spake
his
breath
against
my
face
confused
his
words
yet
made
them
more
intense
as
when
the
sudden
finder
of
the
wind
will
wipe
a
row
of
single
to
a
pure
white
line
of
flame
more
luminous
because
of
obliteration
more
intense
the
intimate
presence
carrying
in
itself
complete
communication
as
with
souls
who
having
put
the
body
off
perceive
through
simply
being
thus
twas
granted
me
to
know
he
loved
me
to
the
depth
and
height
of
such
large
natures
ever
competent
with
grand
horizons
by
the
land
or
sea
to
love
s
grand
sunrise
small
spheres
hold
small
fires
but
he
loved
largely
as
a
man
can
love
who
baffled
in
his
love
dares
live
his
life
accept
the
ends
which
god
loves
for
his
own
and
lift
a
constant
aspect
from
the
day
i
had
brought
to
england
my
poor
searching
face
an
orphan
even
of
my
father
s
grave
he
had
loved
me
watched
me
watched
his
soul
in
mine
which
in
me
grew
and
heightened
into
love
for
he
a
boy
still
had
been
told
the
tale
of
how
a
fairy
bride
from
italy
with
smells
of
oleanders
in
her
hair
was
coming
through
the
vines
to
touch
his
hand
whereat
the
blood
of
boyhood
on
the
palm
made
sudden
heats
and
when
at
last
i
came
and
lived
before
him
lived
and
rarely
smiled
he
smiled
and
loved
me
for
the
thing
i
was
as
every
child
will
love
the
year
s
first
flower
not
certainly
the
fairest
of
the
year
but
in
which
the
complete
year
seems
to
blow
the
poor
sad
snowdrop
between
drifts
mysterious
medium
twixt
the
plant
and
frost
so
faint
with
winter
while
so
quick
with
spring
so
doubtful
if
to
thaw
itself
away
with
that
snow
near
it
not
that
romney
leigh
had
loved
me
coldly
if
i
thought
so
once
it
was
as
if
i
had
held
my
hand
in
fire
and
shook
for
cold
but
now
i
understood
for
ever
that
the
very
fire
and
heat
of
troubling
passion
in
him
burned
him
clear
and
shaped
to
dubious
order
word
and
act
that
just
because
he
loved
me
over
all
all
wealth
all
lands
all
social
privilege
to
which
chance
made
him
unexpected
heir
and
just
because
on
all
these
lesser
gifts
constrained
by
conscience
and
the
sense
of
wrong
he
had
stamped
with
steady
hand
god
s
of
dedication
to
the
human
need
he
thought
it
should
be
so
too
with
his
love
he
passionately
loving
would
bring
down
his
love
his
life
his
best
because
the
best
his
bride
of
dreams
who
walked
so
still
and
high
through
flowery
poems
as
through
the
dust
of
golden
lilies
on
her
feet
that
should
walk
beside
him
on
the
rocks
in
all
that
clang
and
hewing
out
of
men
and
help
the
work
of
help
which
was
his
life
and
prove
he
kept
back
nothing
his
soul
and
when
i
failed
him
i
failed
him
and
when
it
seemed
he
had
missed
my
love
thought
aurora
makes
room
for
a
and
so
with
torn
strips
of
hope
took
up
his
life
as
if
it
were
for
death
just
capable
of
one
heroic
aim
and
threw
it
in
the
thickest
of
the
world
at
which
men
laughed
as
if
he
had
drowned
a
dog
no
wonder
aurora
failed
him
first
the
morning
and
the
evening
made
his
day
but
oh
the
night
oh
oh
sweet
o
dark
o
moon
and
stars
o
ecstasy
of
darkness
o
great
mystery
of
love
in
which
absorbed
loss
anguish
treason
s
self
enlarges
rapture
a
pebble
dropt
in
some
full
the
wine
while
we
two
sate
together
leaned
that
night
so
close
my
very
garments
crept
and
thrilled
with
strange
electric
life
and
both
my
cheeks
grew
red
then
pale
with
touches
from
my
hair
in
which
his
breath
was
while
the
golden
moon
was
hung
before
our
faces
as
the
badge
of
some
sublime
inherited
despair
since
ever
to
be
seen
by
only
one
a
voice
said
low
and
rapid
as
a
sigh
yet
breaking
i
felt
conscious
from
a
smile
thank
god
who
made
me
blind
to
make
me
see
shine
on
aurora
dearest
light
of
souls
which
rul
st
for
evermore
both
day
and
night
i
am
i
flung
closer
to
his
breast
as
sword
that
after
battle
flings
to
sheathe
and
in
that
hurtle
of
united
souls
the
mystic
motions
which
in
common
moods
are
shut
beyond
our
sense
broke
in
on
us
and
as
we
sate
we
felt
the
old
earth
spin
and
all
the
starry
turbulence
of
worlds
swing
round
us
in
their
audient
circles
till
if
that
same
golden
moon
were
overhead
or
if
beneath
our
feet
we
did
not
know
and
then
calm
equal
smooth
with
weights
of
joy
his
voice
rose
as
some
chief
musician
s
song
amid
the
old
jewish
temple
s
and
bade
me
mark
how
we
two
met
at
last
upon
this
promontory
of
earth
to
give
up
much
on
each
side
then
take
all
beloved
it
sang
we
must
be
here
to
work
and
men
who
work
can
only
work
for
men
and
not
to
work
in
vain
must
comprehend
humanity
and
so
work
humanly
and
raise
men
s
bodies
still
by
raising
souls
as
god
did
but
stand
upon
the
earth
i
said
to
raise
them
this
is
human
too
there
s
nothing
high
which
has
not
first
been
low
my
humbleness
said
one
has
made
me
great
as
god
did
and
work
all
silently
and
simply
he
returned
as
god
does
all
distort
our
nature
never
for
our
work
nor
count
our
right
hands
stronger
for
being
hoofs
the
man
most
man
with
tenderest
human
hands
works
best
for
men
god
in
he
paused
upon
the
word
and
then
resumed
fewer
programmes
we
who
have
no
prescience
fewer
systems
we
who
are
held
and
do
not
hold
less

of

be

by

no

of

had
been
no
lawgiver
unless
he
had
given
the
life
too
with
the
i
echoed
the

most

best
for

and
if
most
man
indeed
he
gets
his
manhood
plainest
from
his
soul
while
obviously
this
stringent
soul
itself
obeys
our
old
rules

ever
witnessing
in
ours
and
love
the

next
he
smiled
the
love
of
wedded
souls
which
still
presents
that
mystery
s
counterpart
sweet
upon
the
water
of
life
of
such
a
mystic
substance

dim
waters
of
a
troubled
life
the
flower
of
heaven
so
vainly
overhangs
what
perfect
counterpart
would
be
in
sight
if
tanks
were
clearer
let
us
clean
the
tubes
and
wait
for
rains
o
poet
o
my
love
since
was
too
ambitious
in
my
deed
and
thought
to
distance
all
men
in
success
till
god
came
on
me
marked
the
place
and
said
henceforth
keep
within
this
line
attempting
less
than
others
i
stand
and
work
among
christ
s
little
ones
content
come
thou
my
compensation
my
dear
sight
my
my
morning
rise
and
shine
and
touch
my
hills
with
radiance
not
their
own
shine
out
for
two
aurora
and
fulfil
my
that
must
be
work
for
two
as
i
though
thus
restrained
for
two
shall
love
gaze
on
with
inscient
vision
toward
the
sun
and
from
his
visceral
heat
pluck
out
the
roots
of
light
beyond
him
art
s
a
service
a
silver
key
is
given
to
thy
clasp
and
thou
shalt
stand
unwearied
night
and
day
and
fix
it
in
the
hard
wards
and
open
so
that
intermediate
door
betwixt
the
different
planes
of
sensuous
form
and
form
insensuous
that
inferior
men
may
learn
to
feel
on
still
through
these
to
those
and
bless
thy
ministration
the
world
waits
for
help
beloved
let
us
love
so
well
our
work
shall
still
be
better
for
our
love
and
still
our
love
be
sweeter
for
our
work
and
both
commended
for
the
sake
of
each
by
all
true
workers
and
true
lovers
born
now
press
the
clarion
on
thy
woman
s
lip
love
s
holy
kiss
shall
still
keep
consecrate
and
breathe
the
fine
keen
breath
along
the
brass
and
blow
all
level
as
jericho
s
past
jordan
crying
from
the
top
of
souls
to
souls
that
they
assemble
on
earth
s
flats
to
get
them
to
some
purer
eminence
than
any
hitherto
beheld
for
clouds
what
height
we
know
not
the
way
we
know
and
how
by
mounting
aye
we
must
attain
and
so
climb
on
it
is
the
hour
for
souls
that
bodies
leavened
by
the
will
and
love
be
lightened
to
redemption
the
world
s
old
but
the
old
world
waits
the
hour
to
be
renewed
toward
which
new
hearts
in
individual
growth
must
quicken
and
increase
to
multitude
in
new
dynasties
of
the
race
of
men
developed
whence
shall
grow

new
churches
new

new

admitting
freedom
new

make

seeing
spirits
toward
the

he
turned
instinctively
faint
and
fair
along
the
tingling
desert
of
the
sky
beyond
the
circle
of
the

hills
were
laid
in
as
clear
as

the

foundations
of
that
new
near
day
which
should
be
builded
out
of

to

stood
a
moment
with
erected
brows
in
silence
as
a
creature

who
gazed

calm
and

his
blind
majestic
