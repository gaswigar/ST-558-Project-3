chapter
i
it
is
strange
that
i
can
never
think
of
writing
any
account
of
my
life
without
thinking
of
pauline
mills
and
wondering
what
she
will
say
of
it
pauline
is
rather
given
to
reading
the
autobiographies
of
distinguished
people
unless
she
has
left
off
since
i
disappointed
her
and
finding
in
them
new
persuasions
of
the
fundamental
lightness
of
her
scheme
of
things
i
recall
very
well
how
when
i
was
having
the
bad
time
of
my
life
there
in
chicago
she
would
abound
in
consoling
instances
from
one
then
appearing
in
the
monthly
magazines
skidding
over
the
obvious
derivation
of
the
biographist
son
from
the
lord
knows
who
except
that
it
was
from
the
man
to
whom
she
was
legally
married
to
fix
on
the
foolish
detail
of
the
child
tempers
and
woolly
lambs
as
the
advertisement
of
that
true
womanliness
which
pauline
loves
to
pluck
from
every
feminine
bush
there
was
also
a
great
deal
in
that
story
about
a
certain
other
celebrity
for
her
relations
to
whom
the
writer
was
blackballed
in
a
club
of
which
i
afterward
became
a
member
and
i
think
it
was
the
things
pauline
said
about
one
of
the
rewards
of
genius
being
the
privilege
of
association
with
such
transcendent
personalities
on
a
footing
which
permitted
one
to
call
them
by
their
first
names
in
one
reminiscences
that
gave
me
the
notion
of
writing
this
book
it
has
struck
me
as
humorous
to
a
degree
that
in
this
sort
of
writing
the
really
important
things
are
usually
left
out
i
thought
then
of
writing
the
life
of
an
accomplished
woman
not
so
much
of
the
accomplishment
as
of
the
woman
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
a
start
at
it
without
thinking
of
pauline
mills
and
that
curious
social
warp
which
obligates
us
most
to
impeach
the
validity
of
a
opinion
at
the
points
where
it
is
most
supported
by
experience
from
the
earliest
i
have
been
rendered
highly
suspicious
of
the
social
estimate
of
women
by
the
general
social
conspiracy
against
her
telling
the
truth
about
herself
but
in
fact
i
do
not
think
mills
will
read
my
book
henry
will
read
it
first
at
his
office
and
tell
her
that
rather
she
should
for
henry
has
been
so
successfully
paulined
that
it
is
quite
sufficient
for
any
statement
of
life
to
lie
outside
his
wife
accepted
bias
to
stamp
it
with
insidious
impropriety
there
is
at
times
something
almost
heroic
in
the
resolution
with
which
women
like
pauline
mills
defend
themselves
from
whatever
might
shift
the
centres
of
their
complacency
but
even
without
pauline
it
interests
me
greatly
to
undertake
this
book
of
which
i
have
said
in
the
title
as
much
as
a
phrase
may
of
the
scope
of
the
undertaking
for
if
i
know
anything
of
genius
it
is
wholly
extraneous
derived
impersonal
flowing
through
and
by
i
can
not
tell
you
what
it
is
but
i
hope
to
show
you
a
little
of
how
i
was
seized
of
it
shaped
what
resistances
opposed
to
it
what
surrenders
i
mean
to
put
as
plainly
as
possible
how
i
felt
it
fumbling
at
my
earlier
life
like
the
sea
at
the
foot
of
a
tidal
wall
and
by
what
rifts
in
the
structure
of
living
its
inundation
rose
upon
me
by
what
practices
and
passions
i
was
enlarged
to
it
and
by
what
well
meaning
of
my
friends
i
was
cramped
and
hardened
but
of
its
ultimate
operation
once
it
had
worked
up
through
my
stiff
clay
of
triumphs
profits
all
the
intricacies
of
technique
gossip
of
rehearsals
you
shall
hear
next
to
nothing
this
is
the
story
of
the
struggle
between
a
genius
for
tragic
acting
and
the
daughter
of
a
county
clerk
with
the
social
ideal
of
taylorville
ohianna
for
the
villain
it
is
a
drama
in
which
none
of
the
characters
played
the
parts
they
were
cast
for
and
invariably
spoke
from
the
wrong
cues
which
nevertheless
proceeded
to
a
successful
dénouement
but
if
you
are
looking
for
anything
ordinarily
called
plot
you
will
be
disappointed
plot
is
distinctly
the
province
of
fiction
though
i
a
notion
there
is
a
sort
of
order
in
my
story
if
one
could
look
at
it
from
the
vantage
of
the
gods
but
i
have
never
rightly
made
it
out
what
i
mean
to
go
about
is
the
exploitation
of
the
personal
phases
of
genius
of
which
when
it
refers
to
myself
you
must
not
understand
me
to
speak
as
of
a
peculiar
merit
like
the
faculty
for
presiding
at
a
woman
club
or
baking
sixteen
pies
of
a
morning
which
distinguished
one
taylorvillian
from
another
rather
as
a
seizure
a
possession
which
overtook
me
unaware
like
one
of
those
insidious
oriental
disorders
which
you
may
never
die
of
but
can
never
be
cured
you
shall
hear
how
i
did
successfully
stave
it
off
in
my
youth
for
the
sake
of
a
working
taylor
and
men
outfitter
and
was
nearly
intimidated
out
of
it
by
the
wife
of
a
chicago
attorney
who
had
something
to
do
with
stocks
how
i
was
often
very
tired
of
it
and
many
times
especially
in
the
earlier
periods
when
i
was
trying
to
effect
a
compromise
between
it
and
the
taylorvillian
predilections
i
should
have
been
happiest
to
have
been
quit
of
it
altogether
i
shall
try
to
have
you
understand
that
i
have
not
undertaken
to
restate
those
phases
of
autobiography
which
are
commonly
suppressed
because
of
an
exception
to
what
the
public
has
finally
and
at
large
concurred
in
that
it
does
not
particularly
matter
what
happens
to
the
vessel
of
personality
so
long
as
the
essential
fluid
gets
through
but
from
having
gone
so
much
farther
to
discover
that
it
matters
not
a
little
to
genius
to
be
so
scamped
and
retarded
i
have
arrived
at
seeing
the
uncritical
acceptance
of
poverty
and
heartbreak
as
essential
accompaniments
of
gift
very
much
of
a
piece
with
the
proneness
of
christians
to
regard
the
early
martyrdoms
as
concomitants
of
faith
when
every
thinking
person
knows
they
arose
in
the
cruelty
and
stupidity
of
the
bystanders
hardly
any
one
seems
to
have
recalled
in
this
connection
that
the
initial
christian
experience
is
a
baptism
of
joy
and
it
was
only
in
the
business
of
communicating
it
that
it
became
bloody
and
tormenting
if
you
will
go
a
little
farther
with
me
you
shall
be
made
to
see
the
miseries
of
genius
perhaps
also
the
bulk
of
wretchedness
everywhere
not
so
much
the
rod
of
inexplicable
chastisement
as
the
reaction
of
a
purblind
social
complacency
i
shall
take
you
at
the
sincerest
in
admitting
the
function
of
art
to
be
its
of
the
bread
of
life
until
it
nourishes
us
toward
greater
achievement
as
a
basis
for
proving
that
much
that
you
may
be
thinking
about
its
processes
is
wrong
and
most
that
you
may
have
done
for
its
support
is
beside
the
mark
if
i
have
had
any
compunction
about
writing
this
book
it
has
been
the
fear
that
in
the
relation
of
incidents
difficult
and
sordid
you
might
still
miss
the
point
of
your
being
largely
to
blame
for
them
and
even
if
you
escape
the
banality
of
believing
that
my
having
lived
for
a
week
in
chicago
on
cents
was
in
any
way
important
to
my
artistic
development
and
go
so
far
as
to
apprehend
it
as
it
actually
was
a
foolish
and
unnecessary
interference
with
my
business
of
serving
you
anew
with
entertainment
you
must
go
a
little
farther
honestly
to
accept
it
even
when
it
came
this
revitalizing
fluid
of
which
i
was
for
the
moment
the
vase
the
cup
in
circumstances
which
in
the
rule
you
live
by
appear
when
not
actually
reprehensible
at
least
ridiculous
looking
back
over
a
series
of
struggles
that
have
left
me
in
a
frame
when
no
man
under
forty
interests
me
very
much
still
within
the
possibility
of
personal
romance
and
at
an
age
when
most
women
have
the
affectional
value
of
a
keepsake
only
the
arbiter
and
leader
of
my
world
i
seem
to
see
my
life
not
much
else
but
a
breach
in
the
social
fabric
sedulously
bricked
up
from
within
and
battered
from
without
through
which
at
last
pours
light
and
the
fluid
soul
of
life
something
of
all
this
i
shall
try
to
make
plain
to
you
and
incidentally
how
in
the
process
i
have
perceived
dimly
this
huge
coil
of
social
adjustment
as
a
struggle
the
invasive
forces
of
blessedness
the
smother
of
sheep
in
the
lanes
stupidly
to
escape
the
fair
pastures
toward
which
a
large
friendliness
herds
them
if
you
go
as
far
as
this
with
me
you
shall
avoid
who
knows
what
indirection
and
that
not
altogether
without
entertainment
chapter
ii
of
taylorville
where
i
grew
up
and
was
married
the
most
distinguishing
thing
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
it
from
a
hundred
towns
in
ohianna
to
begin
with
it
was
laid
out
about
a
square
and
had
two
streets
at
right
angles
known
as
main
and
broad
broad
street
i
remember
ran
east
and
west
between
the
high
school
and
the
railway
station
and
main
street
had
the
catholic
cemetery
on
the
south
and
the
tool
and
hoe
works
on
the
north
to
mark
there
was
no
other
visible
distinction
the
points
at
which
it
became
country
road
there
were
numerous
cross
streets
east
and
west
called
after
the
governors
or
perhaps
it
was
the
presidents
and
north
and
south
set
forth
on
official
maps
as
avenues
taking
their
names
from
the
trees
with
which
they
were
falsely
declared
to
be
planted
though
i
do
not
recall
that
they
were
ever
spoken
of
by
these
names
except
by
the
leading
county
paper
which
had
its
office
in
one
corner
of
the
square
over
the
coöperative
store
was
republican
in
politics
and
stood
for
progress
the
square
was
planted
with
maples
a
hitching
rack
ran
quite
around
it
and
was
in
the
number
and
character
of
the
vehicles
attached
to
it
a
sort
of
public
calendar
for
the
days
of
the
week
and
the
seasons
on
court
days
and
elections
i
remember
they
quite
filled
the
rack
and
overflowed
to
the
in
front
of
the
courthouse
which
stood
on
its
own
ground
a
little
off
from
the
square
balanced
on
the
opposite
side
by
the
methodist
church
it
was
a
perfect
index
to
the
country
neighbourhoods
that
spread
east
and
north
to
the
flat
black
corn
lands
west
to
the
marl
and
clay
of
the
river
district
and
south
to
the
oozy
bottoms
teams
from
the
bottoms
i
believe
always
had
cockleburs
in
their
tails
and
spanking
dapple
grays
drove
in
with
shining
from
the
stock
farms
whose
flacking
windmills
on
the
straight
horizons
of
the
north
struck
on
my
childish
fancy
as
some
sort
of
mechanical
scarecrow
to
frighten
away
the
homey
charms
of
the
wooded
hills
i
recall
this
sort
of
detail
as
the
only
thing
in
my
native
town
that
affected
my
imagination
when
i
saw
the
flakes
of
black
loam
dropping
from
the
tires
or
the
yellow
clay
of
the
river
district
caked
solidly
about
the
racked
hubs
i
was
stirred
by
the
allurement
of
travel
and
adventure
the
movement
of
human
enterprise
on
the
fourwent
ways
of
the
world
from
my
always
seeming
to
see
them
so
bemired
with
their
recent
passages
i
gather
that
my
observations
must
have
been
made
chiefly
in
winter
on
my
way
to
school
from
other
memories
of
taylorville
arched
in
by
the
elms
and
maples
smelling
of
dust
and
syringas
and
never
quite
separable
from
a
suspicion
of
boredom
i
judge
my
summer
acquaintance
with
its
streets
to
have
been
chiefly
by
way
of
going
to
church
for
until
the
winter
i
was
eleven
years
old
taylorville
the
world
in
fact
meant
hadley
pasture
it
lay
back
of
that
part
of
the
town
where
our
house
was
contiguous
to
a
common
of
abandoned
orchard
and
cow
lot
and
if
it
lacked
anything
of
adventurous
occasion
and
delight
we
forrie
and
effie
and
i
the
mcgee
children
and
the
little
allinghams
did
not
know
it
there
was
a
sort
of
convention
of
childhood
that
we
should
never
go
straight
to
it
by
the
proper
path
but
it
must
always
be
taken
by
assault
or
stealth
over
the
woodhouse
and
then
along
the
top
of
the
orchard
fence
as
far
as
you
could
manage
without
falling
off
and
then
tagging
the
orchard
trees
i
remember
there
were
times
when
we
felt
obliged
to
climb
up
every
tree
in
our
way
and
down
on
the
other
side
and
so
to
the
stump
lot
where
the
earliest
violets
were
to
be
found
how
blue
it
would
be
with
them
in
april
about
the
fairy
ring
of
some
decaying
trunk
and
beyond
the
stump
lot
the
alder
brook
and
the
pond
where
we
caught
a
pike
once
come
up
from
the
river
to
spawn
up
from
the
brook
ranged
a
wood
over
the
shallow
hills
farther
and
darker
than
we
dared
and
along
its
banks
was
every
variety
of
pleasantness
there
was
always
something
to
be
done
there
springs
to
be
scooped
out
rills
to
be
dammed
always
something
to
eat
sassafras
root
minnows
taken
by
hand
and
half
cooked
on
surreptitious
fires
red
haws
and
hazelnuts
always
some
place
to
be
visited
with
freshness
and
discovery
dark
umbrageous
corners
to
provide
that
dreaded
and
delighted
panic
of
the
wild
but
perhaps
the
best
service
the
pasture
did
us
was
as
a
theatre
for
the
dramatization
of
the
bourgeoning
social
instinct
we
played
at
church
and
school
in
it
at
scalping
and
robinson
crusoe
and
the
three
bears
we
went
farther
and
played
at
high
priests
and
oracles
and
sacrifice
and
what
were
we
at
taylorville
to
know
of
such
things
if
this
were
to
be
as
full
an
account
of
my
art
as
it
is
of
myself
i
should
have
to
stop
here
and
try
to
have
you
understand
how
at
this
time
i
was
all
awash
in
the
fluid
stuff
of
it
buoyed
and
possessed
by
unknowledgable
splendours
heroisms
tendernesses
a
shifty
glittering
flood
i
am
always
checked
in
my
attempt
to
render
this
submerged
childhood
of
mine
by
the
recollection
of
my
mother
in
the
midst
of
the
annoyance
which
any
reference
to
it
always
caused
her
trying
judicially
to
account
for
it
on
the
basis
of
my
having
read
too
much
with
the
lurking
conviction
at
the
bottom
of
all
comment
that
a
few
more
spankings
might
have
effectually
counteracted
it
but
though
i
read
more
than
the
other
children
there
was
never
very
much
to
read
in
taylorville
at
any
time
and
no
amount
of
reading
could
have
put
into
my
mind
what
i
found
there
the
sustaining
fairy
wonder
of
the
world
i
was
not
i
think
different
in
kind
from
the
other
children
except
as
being
more
consistently
immersed
in
it
and
never
quite
dispossessed
i
have
lost
and
rediscovered
the
way
to
it
some
several
times
have
indeed
had
to
defend
its
approaches
with
violence
and
skill
this
whole
business
of
the
biography
has
no
other
point
in
fact
than
to
show
you
how
far
my
human
behaviour
has
been
timed
to
keep
what
i
believe
most
people
part
with
no
more
distressfully
than
with
their
milk
teeth
effie
i
know
has
no
recollection
of
this
period
other
than
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
earth
was
hung
with
vestiges
of
splendour
and
if
my
brother
has
kept
anything
of
his
original
inheritance
he
would
sooner
admit
to
a
left
over
appetite
for
jujubes
and
liquorice
for
forester
is
fully
of
the
common
opinion
that
the
fevers
flights
and
drops
of
temperament
are
the
mere
infirmity
of
gift
there
was
a
time
before
i
left
off
talking
to
forester
at
all
about
my
work
when
he
visibly
permitted
his
pity
to
assuage
his
disgust
at
the
persistence
of
so
patent
a
silliness
in
me
and
still
earlier
before
i
owned
three
motor
cars
an
estate
in
florida
and
a
house
on
the
hudson
there
were
not
wanting
intimations
of
its
voluntary
assumption
as
a
pose
pose
in
forester
vocabulary
standing
for
any
frame
of
behaviour
to
which
he
is
not
naturally
addicted
but
there
it
was
the
flux
of
experience
rising
to
the
surface
of
our
plays
the
reservoir
from
which
later
without
having
personally
contemplated
such
an
act
i
drew
the
authority
for
how
lady
macbeth
must
have
felt
about
to
do
a
murder
from
which
if
i
had
had
a
taste
for
it
i
might
have
drawn
with
like
assurance
the
necessity
of
the
square
of
the
hypotenuse
to
equal
the
squares
of
the
other
two
sides
it
is
curious
that
though
i
can
not
remember
how
my
father
looked
nor
who
taught
me
long
division
i
recall
perfectly
how
the
reddening
blackberry
leaves
lay
under
the
hoar
frost
in
hadley
pasture
and
the
dew
between
the
pale
gold
wires
of
the
grass
on
summer
mornings
and
the
very
words
and
rites
by
which
we
paid
observance
to
snockerty
i
am
not
sure
whether
ellen
mcgee
or
i
invented
him
but
first
and
last
he
got
us
into
as
much
trouble
as
though
we
had
not
always
distinctly
recognized
him
for
an
invention
the
mcgees
lived
quite
around
the
corner
of
the
pasture
from
us
and
as
far
as
my
memory
serves
the
whole
seven
of
them
had
nothing
to
do
but
lie
in
wait
for
any
appearance
of
ours
in
the
stump
lot
though
in
respect
to
their
father
being
a
section
boss
and
the
family
catholic
we
were
not
supposed
when
we
put
on
our
good
clothes
and
went
out
of
the
front
gate
to
meet
them
socially
i
think
there
must
have
been
also
some
parental
restriction
on
our
intercourse
of
play
for
they
never
came
to
our
house
nor
we
to
theirs
the
little
allinghams
in
fact
never
would
play
with
them
they
came
to
play
with
us
and
only
included
the
mcgees
on
the
implication
of
their
being
our
guests
if
at
any
time
we
three
lattimores
were
called
away
pauline
who
was
the
eldest
would
forthwith
marshal
her
young
tribe
in
exactly
the
same
manner
in
which
she
afterward
held
henry
mills
in
the
paths
of
rectitude
and
march
them
straight
out
of
the
big
gate
to
their
home
i
remember
how
i
used
perfectly
to
hate
the
expression
of
the
little
allinghams
on
these
occasions
and
sympathize
with
the
not
always
successfully
repressed
jeers
of
the
mcgees
allingham
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
makes
a
point
of
having
the
full
confidence
of
her
children
detestable
practice
and
i
have
always
suspected
in
spite
of
the
friendliness
of
the
families
that
the
little
allinghams
used
to
make
a
sort
of
moral
instance
of
us
whenever
they
fell
into
discredit
with
their
parents
at
any
rate
the
report
of
our
doings
in
pasture
as
they
worked
around
through
her
to
our
mother
would
lead
to
episodes
of
marked
coolness
in
which
we
held
ourselves
each
loftily
aloof
from
the
other
until
incontinently
the
spirit
of
play
swirled
us
together
again
in
a
joyous
democracy
at
the
time
when
the
snockerty
obsession
overtook
us
ellen
mcgee
was
the
only
real
rival
i
had
for
the
leadership
of
the
pasture
if
she
had
not
had
along
with
all
her
irish
quickness
a
touch
of
irish
sycophancy
i
should
have
lost
all
my
ascendency
after
the
advent
of
snockerty
i
feel
sure
now
that
ellen
must
have
invented
him
she
was
most
enviably
furnished
in
all
the
signs
of
lucky
and
unlucky
and
what
it
meant
if
you
put
your
stocking
on
wrong
side
out
in
the
morning
with
charms
to
say
for
warts
and
scraps
of
old
world
song
that
had
all
the
force
of
incantations
her
fairy
tales
too
had
a
more
convincing
sound
for
she
got
them
from
her
father
who
had
always
known
somebody
who
knew
the
human
participators
it
was
commonly
insisted
by
allingham
that
the
mcgee
children
would
never
come
to
anything
and
i
believe
in
fact
they
never
did
but
they
supplied
an
element
of
healthful
vulgarity
in
our
lives
that
remembering
alfred
allingham
adolescent
priggishness
i
am
inclined
to
think
was
very
good
for
us
if
i
have
said
nothing
of
my
parents
until
now
it
is
because
the
part
they
played
in
our
lives
for
the
first
ten
years
was
from
our
point
of
view
negligible
parents
were
a
sort
of
natural
appendage
of
children
against
whose
solidarity
our
performance
had
room
and
opportunity
they
kept
the
house
together
they
staved
off
fear
no
one
for
instance
would
think
of
sleeping
in
a
place
where
there
were
no
parents
they
bulked
large
between
us
and
the
unknown
there
was
a
general
notion
of
our
elders
toward
rubbing
it
into
us
that
we
ought
to
be
excessively
grateful
to
them
for
not
having
turned
us
adrift
food
and
housing
but
i
do
not
think
we
took
it
seriously
parents
existed
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
the
world
livable
for
children
and
on
the
whole
their
disposition
was
friendly
except
in
cases
like
allingham
who
contrived
always
to
give
you
a
guilty
sense
of
having
forgot
to
wipe
your
feet
or
tramped
on
the
flower
borders
i
do
not
think
we
had
a
more
active
belief
in
our
profession
of
absorption
in
our
interests
than
in
my
father
pretence
to
be
desperately
wounded
by
forester
popgun
or
scared
out
of
his
wits
when
effie
jumped
at
him
from
behind
the
syringa
bush
it
was
admittedly
nice
of
them
and
it
kept
the
game
going
but
there
were
also
times
when
they
did
not
manage
it
so
successfully
as
we
could
have
wished
i
think
that
we
never
questioned
their
right
to
punish
us
for
disobedience
perhaps
because
there
is
after
all
something
intrinsically
sound
about
the
right
of
might
though
we
sometimes
questioned
the
occasion
as
when
we
had
been
told
we
might
play
in
the
pasture
for
an
hour
of
the
passage
of
which
we
knew
as
much
as
wild
pigeons
there
was
always
to
me
at
least
an
inexplicableness
about
such
reprisals
that
mitigated
against
their
moral
issue
there
was
one
point
however
upon
which
we
all
three
opposed
an
unalterable
front
we
would
not
kiss
and
make
up
after
our
private
squabbles
we
fought
or
combined
against
neighbouring
tribes
or
divided
our
benefits
with
an
even
handedness
that
obtains
nowhere
as
among
children
but
we
would
not
be
tricked
into
a
status
which
it
might
be
inconvenient
to
maintain
i
am
sure
though
that
allingham
used
rather
to
put
it
over
my
mother
for
her
inability
to
make
little
prigs
of
us
mothers
she
would
say
on
the
rare
occasions
when
she
came
to
call
in
the
beaded
dolman
and
black
kid
gloves
which
other
taylorvillians
wore
only
on
sunday
mothers
with
the
effect
of
making
it
all
capitals
have
an
inestimable
privilege
in
shaping
their
children
characters
this
was
when
we
had
had
our
faces
surreptitiously
washed
and
been
brought
in
for
ceremonial
inspection
and
a
little
later
she
would
add
with
the
air
of
having
tactfully
conveyed
advice
under
the
guise
of
information
i
always
insist
here
forester
would
kick
me
furtively
on
having
the
full
confidence
of
mine
at
which
point
my
mother
would
make
excuses
to
get
me
out
of
the
room
before
i
who
never
could
learn
that
people
are
not
always
of
the
mind
they
think
they
are
made
embarrassing
disclosures
up
to
this
time
my
mother
figures
chiefly
as
a
woman
who
tied
up
our
hurts
and
overruled
my
father
when
he
tried
to
beg
us
off
from
going
to
church
i
suppose
it
was
the
baby
always
in
arms
or
expected
that
kept
us
from
romping
all
over
her
as
we
did
with
my
father
and
much
of
her
profession
of
interest
in
us
which
came
usually
at
the
end
of
admonitory
occasions
had
the
cold
futility
of
the
family
prayers
that
my
mother
tried
to
make
appear
part
of
the
habitual
order
when
cousin
judd
came
to
stay
with
us
i
do
not
know
whether
he
suspected
the
hollowness
of
our
morning
worship
but
i
am
sure
i
was
never
in
the
least
imposed
upon
by
the
high
moral
attitude
from
which
my
mother
attempted
to
deal
with
my
misbehaviours
she
used
to
conduct
these
interviews
on
the
prescription
of
certain
books
by
the
reading
of
which
i
was
afterward
corrupted
on
a
basis
of
shocked
solemnity
that
as
she
was
not
without
a
sense
of
humour
often
broke
down
under
my
raw
disbelief
forester
always
amenable
to
suggestion
was
sometimes
reduced
to
writhing
contrition
by
these
inquisitorial
attempts
but
i
came
away
from
them
oftenest
not
a
little
embarrassed
by
her
inability
to
bring
anything
to
pass
by
them
i
do
not
think
our
detachment
was
greater
than
is
common
with
young
children
in
families
where
they
are
pushed
out
of
their
privilege
of
cuddling
as
fast
as
they
were
in
ours
there
was
thirteen
months
between
forester
and
me
another
brother
early
dead
before
effie
and
two
that
came
after
the
children
who
died
were
always
sickly
i
think
it
probable
in
the
country
phrase
so
appalling
in
its
easy
acceptance
my
mother
had
never
seen
a
well
day
and
what
was
meant
to
be
the
joy
of
loving
was
utterly
swamped
for
her
in
its
accompanying
dread
i
seem
to
have
been
born
into
the
knowledge
that
the
breast
the
lap
and
the
brooding
tenderness
were
the
sole
prerogative
of
babies
it
was
imperative
to
your
larger
estate
not
to
exhibit
the
weakness
of
wanting
them
there
comes
back
to
me
in
this
connection
an
evening
with
us
three
forester
effie
and
i
squeezed
on
to
the
lowest
step
of
the
stairs
for
company
my
mother
in
the
dusk
rocking
and
singing
one
of
those
wildly
sweet
and
tragic
melodies
that
the
men
brought
back
out
of
the
south
as
seeds
are
carried
in
a
sheep
coat
to
this
day
i
can
not
hear
it
without
a
certain
swelling
to
let
in
the
smell
of
the
summer
dusk
and
the
flitter
of
the
bats
outside
and
the
quaver
of
my
voice
i
could
see
the
baby
white
gown
hanging
over
her
arm
it
was
the
next
one
after
effie
and
already
she
must
have
been
expecting
the
next
and
the
soft
screech
of
the
rocker
on
the
deal
floor
and
all
at
once
i
knew
with
what
certainty
it
hurts
me
still
to
remember
how
it
felt
to
be
held
so
close
and
safe
and
the
swell
of
the
breast
under
the
song
and
the
swing
of
the
rocker
knew
it
as
if
i
had
been
but
that
moment
dispossessed
and
the
need
as
i
know
now
i
have
always
needed
to
be
so
enfolded
i
do
not
remember
just
what
happened
i
seem
to
have
come
to
from
a
fit
of
passionate
crying
climbed
up
out
of
it
by
a
hand
that
gripped
me
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
me
occasionally
by
way
of
hastening
my
composure
i
was
struggling
desperately
to
get
away
from
it
away
from
the
mother
who
held
me
so
to
the
mother
i
had
just
remembered
and
there
was
jule
the
maid
holding
up
the
lamp
ordering
me
to
bed
in
the
dark
for
having
spoiled
our
quiet
evening
then
after
what
seemed
a
long
time
effie
snuggled
up
to
me
under
the
covers
terrified
by
my
sudden
accession
of
sobs
but
too
loyal
to
call
down
the
household
upon
us
it
came
back
the
need
of
mothering
there
was
a
time
when
i
had
lain
abed
some
days
with
the
measles
or
whatever
i
was
small
enough
i
remember
to
lie
in
the
crib
bed
that
was
kept
downstairs
for
the
prevalent
baby
and
my
mouth
was
dry
with
fever
i
recall
my
mother
standing
over
me
and
my
being
taken
dreadfully
with
the
need
of
that
sustaining
bosom
and
her
stooping
to
my
stretched
arms
divinely
and
then
i
asked
her
to
put
me
down
again
i
have
had
drops
and
sinkings
but
nothing
to
compare
with
this
for
there
was
nothing
there
you
understand
the
release
the
comforting
it
was
there
was
never
there
at
chapter
iii
but
i
began
to
tell
you
how
ellen
mcgee
and
i
invented
snockerty
and
arrived
at
our
first
contact
with
organized
society
at
least
forrie
and
effie
and
i
did
for
it
led
to
our
being
interdicted
the
society
of
the
mcgee
children
for
so
long
that
we
forgot
to
inquire
what
inconvenience
if
any
they
suffered
on
account
of
it
you
will
see
for
yourself
that
ellen
must
have
invented
him
where
indeed
should
a
taylorville
child
get
the
stuff
for
it
god
we
knew
and
were
greatly
bored
by
his
inordinate
partiality
for
the
jews
as
against
all
ancient
peoples
and
by
the
inquisitorial
eye
and
ear
forever
at
the
keyhole
of
our
lives
as
cousin
judd
never
spared
to
remind
us
and
personally
i
was
convinced
of
a
large
friendliness
brooding
over
hadley
pasture
to
the
sense
of
which
i
woke
every
morning
afresh
was
called
by
it
and
to
it
walking
apart
from
the
others
i
vaguely
prayed
but
snockerty
was
of
the
stripe
of
trolls
leprechauns
pucks
and
hobgoblins
we
began
i
remember
by
thinking
of
him
as
resident
in
an
old
hollow
apple
tree
down
which
if
small
trifles
were
dropped
they
fell
out
of
reach
and
sound
there
was
the
inviting
hole
arm
high
in
the
apple
trunk
into
which
you
popped
bright
pebbles
bits
of
glass
and
i
suppose
he
might
have
sprung
very
naturally
from
the
need
of
justifying
your
having
parted
with
something
you
valued
and
could
get
back
again
at
the
prompting
of
an
impulse
you
did
not
understand
very
presently
the
practice
grew
into
the
acknowledgment
of
a
personality
amenable
to
our
desires
we
took
to
dropping
small
belongings
in
the
tree
for
an
omen
of
the
day
whether
the
spring
was
full
or
not
or
if
we
should
find
any
pawpaws
in
the
wood
and
drew
the
augury
from
anything
that
happened
immediately
afterward
say
if
the
wind
ruffled
the
leaves
or
if
a
rabbit
ran
out
of
the
grass
it
was
ellen
who
showed
the
most
wit
in
interpreting
the
signs
and
afterward
reconciling
their
inconsistencies
but
it
was
i
conceived
the
notion
of
propitiating
snockerty
who
by
this
time
had
come
to
exercise
a
marked
influence
on
all
our
plays
by
a
species
of
dramatic
entertainment
made
up
of
scraps
of
school
exercises
sunday
hymns
recitations
and
particularly
of
improvisations
in
which
ellen
and
i
vied
there
were
times
when
even
in
the
midst
of
these
ritualistic
observances
we
would
go
off
at
a
tangent
of
normal
play
quite
oblivious
of
snockerty
other
times
we
were
so
worked
upon
by
our
own
performance
as
to
make
sacrifices
of
really
valuable
possessions
and
variously
to
afflict
ourselves
it
was
i
i
remember
who
scared
one
of
the
little
allinghams
almost
into
fits
by
my
rendering
in
the
name
of
snockerty
of
an
anathema
which
i
had
picked
up
somewhere
but
it
was
ellen
who
contrived
to
extend
his
influence
over
the
whole
of
our
territory
by
finding
in
every
decaying
stump
and
hollow
trunk
a
means
of
communication
and
deriving
therefrom
authority
for
any
wild
prank
that
happened
to
come
into
her
head
it
is
curious
that
in
all
the
escapades
which
were
imposed
on
us
in
the
name
of
our
deity
for
which
we
were
duly
punished
not
one
word
of
the
real
cause
of
our
outbreaks
ever
leaked
through
to
our
parents
it
was
the
only
thing
i
believe
the
little
allinghams
never
told
their
mother
not
even
when
the
second
youngest
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
propitiation
made
a
sacrifice
of
a
handful
of
his
careful
curls
which
i
personally
hacked
off
for
him
with
forester
pocket
knife
he
lied
like
a
little
gentleman
and
said
he
had
cut
them
off
himself
because
he
was
tired
of
looking
like
a
girl
baby
i
think
it
must
have
been
about
the
end
of
snockerty
second
summer
that
ellen
wild
humour
got
us
all
into
serious
trouble
which
resulted
in
my
first
real
contact
with
authority
along
the
west
side
of
hadley
pasture
between
it
and
the
county
road
lay
the
tilled
fields
of
the
ross
property
corn
and
pumpkins
and
turnips
against
which
a
solemn
trespass
board
advised
us
it
was
that
board
no
doubt
which
led
to
our
always
referring
to
the
owner
of
it
as
old
man
ross
for
except
as
he
was
a
tall
stooping
childless
man
i
do
not
know
how
he
had
deserved
our
disrespect
i
have
suspected
since
that
the
trespass
sign
did
not
originate
wholly
in
the
alleged
cantankerousness
of
farmer
ross
and
that
the
mcgees
knew
more
of
the
taste
of
his
young
turnips
and
roasting
ears
than
they
admitted
at
the
time
when
snockerty
announced
to
ellen
through
the
hollow
of
a
dark
gnarly
oak
at
the
foot
of
hadley
hill
that
he
would
be
acceptably
served
by
a
feast
of
green
corn
and
turnips
out
of
field
this
was
the
first
time
the
idea
of
such
a
depredation
had
occurred
to
us
i
believe
for
we
were
really
good
children
in
the
main
but
i
do
not
think
we
had
any
notion
of
disobeying
personally
i
rather
delighted
in
the
idea
of
being
compelled
to
desperate
enterprises
i
recall
the
wild
freebooting
dash
the
scramble
over
the
fence
the
rustle
of
the
corn
full
of
delicious
intimations
of
ambush
and
surprise
the
real
fear
of
coming
suddenly
on
old
man
ross
among
the
rows
where
i
suspect
we
did
a
great
deal
of
damage
in
the
search
for
ears
suitable
to
roast
and
the
derisive
epithets
which
we
did
not
spare
to
fling
over
our
shoulders
as
we
escaped
into
the
brush
with
our
booty
there
was
a
perfect
little
carnival
of
wickedness
in
the
safe
hollow
where
we
stripped
the
ears
for
roasting
fires
too
were
forbidden
us
where
we
dared
old
man
ross
to
come
on
gave
dramatic
rehearsals
of
what
we
should
do
to
him
in
that
event
and
revelled
in
forbidden
manners
and
interdicted
words
i
remember
the
delightful
shock
of
hearing
alfred
allingham
declare
that
he
meant
to
get
his
belly
full
of
green
corn
anyway
for
belly
was
a
word
that
no
well
brought
up
taylorville
child
was
expected
to
use
on
any
occasion
and
finally
how
we
all
took
hands
in
a
wild
dance
around
the
fire
and
over
it
crying
snockerty
snockerty
snockerty
in
a
sort
of
savage
singsong
following
on
the
heels
of
that
a
sort
of
film
came
over
the
performance
an
intimation
of
our
disgust
in
each
other
at
the
connivance
of
wrongdoing
i
remember
as
we
came
up
through
the
orchard
rather
late
this
feeling
grew
upon
us
the
sense
of
taint
of
cheapness
which
swelled
into
a
most
abominable
conviction
of
guilt
as
we
discovered
old
man
ross
on
the
front
porch
talking
to
our
father
and
then
with
what
a
heaviness
of
raw
turnips
and
culpability
we
huddled
in
about
our
mother
going
with
brisk
movements
to
and
fro
getting
supper
and
how
she
cuffed
us
out
of
her
way
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
old
man
ross
had
come
about
finally
the
overwhelming
consciousness
of
publicity
swooped
down
upon
us
at
my
father
coming
in
through
the
door
very
white
and
angry
wanting
to
know
if
this
were
true
that
he
had
heard
and
it
was
the
utmost
limit
of
opprobriousness
that
our
father
should
get
to
know
of
our
misdeeds
at
all
times
before
when
we
downrightly
transgressed
by
eating
wild
crabs
or
taking
off
our
stockings
to
wade
in
the
brook
too
early
in
the
season
we
bore
our
mother
strictures
according
to
our
several
dispositions
forester
i
remember
was
troubled
with
sensibility
and
used
fairly
to
give
us
over
to
wrath
by
the
advertisement
of
guilty
behaviour
he
had
a
vocation
for
confession
wept
copiously
under
whippings
which
did
him
a
world
of
good
and
went
about
for
days
with
a
chastened
manner
which
irritated
me
excessively
i
believe
now
that
he
was
quite
sincere
in
it
but
there
was
a
feeling
among
the
rest
of
us
that
he
carried
the
admission
of
culpability
too
far
myself
since
i
never
entered
on
disobedience
without
having
settled
with
myself
that
the
fun
of
it
would
be
worth
the
pains
scorned
repentance
and
endured
correction
with
a
philosophy
which
got
me
the
reputation
of
being
a
hardened
and
froward
child
that
we
did
not
on
this
basis
get
into
more
serious
scrapes
was
due
to
effie
who
could
never
bear
any
sort
of
unpleasantness
parents
if
you
crossed
them
had
a
way
of
making
things
so
very
unpleasant
it
was
effie
who
if
we
went
to
the
neighbours
for
a
stated
visit
kept
her
eye
upon
the
clock
and
if
she
found
us
yielding
to
temptation
was
fertile
in
the
invention
of
counter
exploits
just
as
exciting
and
quite
within
the
parental
pale
and
when
we
did
fall
had
a
genius
for
extrication
as
great
as
forester
for
propitiatory
behaviour
so
it
fell
out
that
our
piratical
descent
on
ross
field
was
our
first
encounter
with
an
order
of
things
that
transcended
my
mother
personal
jurisdiction
up
to
this
time
contact
with
our
parents
world
had
got
no
farther
than
vainglorious
imaginings
of
our
proper
entry
into
it
and
now
suddenly
we
found
that
we
were
in
it
haled
there
by
our
own
acts
in
the
unhappy
quality
of
offenders
i
think
this
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
been
glad
it
was
forester
who
was
the
boy
and
not
i
who
was
made
to
go
with
my
father
and
allingham
to
ross
field
to
point
out
the
damage
for
which
they
paid
it
was
this
which
sealed
the
enormity
of
our
offence
money
was
paid
for
it
and
came
near
to
losing
its
moral
point
with
forrie
who
felt
himself
immeasurably
raised
in
the
estimate
of
the
other
boys
as
a
public
character
it
served
along
with
my
father
anger
which
was
so
new
to
us
to
raise
the
occasion
to
a
solemn
note
against
which
mere
switchings
were
inconsiderable
no
doubt
my
brother
has
forgotten
it
by
now
along
with
effie
who
got
off
with
nothing
worse
than
the
complicity
of
having
been
one
of
us
but
to
me
the
incident
takes
rank
as
the
beginning
of
a
new
kind
of
snockertism
which
was
to
array
itself
indefinitely
against
the
forces
inappreciably
sucking
at
the
bottom
of
my
life
it
was
as
if
on
the
very
first
occasion
of
my
swimming
to
the
surface
of
my
lustrous
seas
i
was
taken
with
a
line
at
the
end
of
which
i
was
to
be
played
into
shoals
and
shallows
to
foul
with
my
flounderings
some
clear
pools
and
scatter
the
peace
of
many
smaller
fry
i
mean
the
obligation
of
repute
the
necessity
of
being
loyal
to
what
i
found
in
the
world
because
it
had
been
founded
in
sincerity
with
pains
for
what
my
father
made
clear
to
us
as
the
very
crux
of
our
transgression
was
that
we
had
discredited
our
bringing
up
old
man
ross
could
be
paid
for
his
vegetables
but
there
was
nothing
i
was
given
to
understand
could
satisfy
our
arrears
to
our
parents
honour
which
it
transpired
had
been
appallingly
blackened
in
the
event
nothing
in
my
whole
life
has
so
surprised
me
as
the
capacity
of
this
single
adventure
for
involving
us
in
successive
coils
of
turpitude
and
disaster
though
it
was
not
until
we
followed
my
father
into
the
best
room
the
next
morning
after
he
had
seen
allingham
still
rather
sick
for
the
turnips
had
not
agreed
with
us
that
we
realized
the
worst
rounding
on
us
through
a
stream
of
dreadful
biting
things
that
as
my
father
uttered
them
seemed
to
float
us
clear
beyond
the
pale
of
sympathy
and
hope
i
remember
my
father
walking
up
and
down
with
his
hands
under
his
coat
behind
a
short
man
in
my
recollection
with
a
kind
of
swing
in
his
walk
which
curiously
nobody
but
myself
seems
to
have
noticed
and
a
sort
of
electrical
flash
in
his
manner
which
might
have
come
as
in
this
instance
from
our
never
being
brought
up
before
him
except
when
we
had
done
something
thoroughly
exasperating
i
am
not
sure
that
i
did
not
tell
ellen
mcgee
in
an
attempt
to
render
the
magnitude
of
our
going
over
that
he
rated
us
in
full
uniform
waving
his
sword
which
at
that
moment
hung
with
his
regimentals
over
the
mantelpiece
good
heavens
he
said
you
might
have
been
arrested
for
it
my
children
and
i
thought
i
could
have
trusted
you
good
heavens
suddenly
he
reached
out
as
it
were
over
my
brother
shoulder
to
whom
in
his
capacity
as
the
eldest
son
most
of
this
tirade
was
addressed
with
a
word
for
me
that
was
to
go
tearing
its
way
sorely
to
the
seat
of
memory
and
consciousness
and
lodging
there
become
the
one
point
of
attachment
to
support
the
memory
of
him
beyond
his
death
as
for
you
olivia
i
started
at
this
for
i
had
been
staying
my
misery
for
the
moment
on
a
red
and
black
table
cover
which
my
mother
valued
and
i
was
amazed
to
find
myself
still
able
to
hate
as
for
you
olivia
may
he
would
never
allow
my
name
to
be
shortened
in
the
least
i
surprised
at
you
he
had
expected
better
of
me
then
he
had
reached
beyond
my
surfaces
and
divined
what
i
was
inarticulately
sure
of
that
i
was
different
no
not
better
but
somehow
intrinsically
different
he
was
surprised
at
me
he
did
not
say
so
much
of
forester
and
he
say
that
it
was
exactly
what
he
had
expected
of
the
mcgees
but
he
had
had
a
better
opinion
of
me
i
recall
a
throb
of
exasperation
at
his
never
having
told
me
i
might
have
lived
up
to
it
but
with
all
the
soreness
of
having
dropped
short
of
a
possible
estimate
that
phrase
which
might
have
gone
no
deeper
than
his
momentary
disappointment
is
all
i
have
on
which
to
hang
the
faith
that
perhaps
perhaps
some
vision
had
shaped
on
his
horizon
of
what
i
might
become
i
was
never
anything
to
my
mother
i
know
but
a
cuckoo
egg
dropped
in
her
creditable
nest
but
said
my
father
i
surprised
at
he
was
i
believe
one
of
those
men
who
make
a
speciality
of
integrity
and
of
great
dependability
in
public
service
which
is
often
brought
to
answer
for
the
want
of
private
success
an
early
republican
type
fast
being
relegated
to
small
towns
and
country
neighbourhoods
he
had
a
brilliant
war
record
which
was
partly
responsible
for
his
office
and
a
string
of
debts
pendent
from
some
earlier
mercantile
enterprise
which
in
the
occasion
they
afforded
of
paying
up
under
circumstances
of
great
stringency
appeared
somehow
an
additional
burnish
to
his
name
he
was
a
man
everybody
liked
that
he
was
extremely
gentle
and
gay
in
his
manner
with
us
on
most
occasions
i
remember
very
well
and
i
think
he
must
have
had
a
vein
of
romance
though
i
do
not
know
upon
what
grounds
except
that
among
the
few
books
that
he
left
many
were
of
that
character
and
from
the
names
of
his
children
forester
olivia
may
and
ephemia
called
effie
for
short
which
were
certainly
not
taylorvillian
forester
grew
out
of
a
heroic
incident
of
his
soldiering
of
which
i
have
forgotten
all
the
particulars
except
that
the
other
man
name
was
forester
and
my
father
idea
of
giving
it
to
his
son
who
was
born
about
that
time
was
that
when
he
should
grow
up
and
be
distinguished
the
double
name
of
forester
lattimore
should
serve
at
once
as
a
reminder
and
a
certificate
of
appreciation
i
recall
that
we
children
or
perhaps
it
was
only
i
used
to
abound
in
dramatic
imaginings
of
what
would
happen
when
this
belated
recognition
took
place
though
in
fact
nothing
ever
came
of
it
which
might
have
been
largely
owing
to
my
turning
out
the
least
distinguished
of
men
whether
if
my
father
had
lived
he
would
have
remained
always
as
much
in
the
dark
as
to
the
private
sources
of
my
behaviour
i
try
not
to
guess
but
this
incident
picked
him
out
for
me
among
the
ruck
of
fathers
as
a
man
distinguished
for
propriety
produced
in
the
very
moment
of
pronouncing
me
unworthy
of
it
the
ideal
of
a
personal
standard
if
he
had
up
to
this
time
affected
greatly
my
gratitude
or
affections
he
began
to
shine
for
me
now
with
some
of
the
precious
quality
which
inheres
in
dreams
and
before
the
shine
had
gone
off
i
lost
him
chapter
iv
my
father
death
which
occurred
the
march
following
came
suddenly
wholly
fortuitous
to
the
outward
eye
and
i
have
heard
my
mother
say
in
its
inconsequence
its
failure
to
line
up
with
any
conceivable
moral
occasion
did
much
to
shake
her
faith
in
a
controlling
providence
but
affects
me
still
as
then
as
the
most
incontrovertible
of
evidences
of
powers
moving
at
large
among
men
occupied
with
other
affairs
than
ours
a
little
while
ago
as
i
sat
writing
here
on
my
veranda
looking
riverward
an
ant
ran
across
my
paper
which
i
blew
out
with
my
breath
into
space
and
i
did
not
look
to
see
what
disaster
it
reminded
me
suddenly
of
the
way
i
felt
about
my
father
taking
off
he
was
he
must
have
been
in
the
way
of
some
god
that
march
morning
that
is
one
of
the
evidences
by
which
you
know
that
there
are
gods
at
all
you
play
happily
about
their
knees
sometimes
they
play
with
you
then
you
stumble
against
a
foot
thrust
out
or
the
clamour
of
your
iniquity
disturbs
their
proper
meditations
and
suddenly
you
are
silenced
my
mother
was
doubtless
right
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
stayed
with
her
and
the
children
certainly
happier
but
he
got
in
the
way
of
the
powers
it
is
curious
that
until
i
began
just
now
to
reconstruct
the
circumstances
in
which
the
news
of
his
death
came
to
me
i
never
realized
that
i
might
have
been
looking
on
but
high
above
it
at
the
very
instant
and
occasion
for
from
the
window
of
my
room
in
the
second
story
of
the
taylorville
grammar
school
i
could
see
the
unfinished
walls
of
the
zimmern
block
aglimmer
with
the
light
which
the
wind
heaped
up
and
shattered
against
their
raw
pink
surfaces
and
a
loose
board
of
the
scaffolding
allowed
to
remain
up
all
winter
flacking
like
a
torn
leaf
in
the
mighty
current
in
which
the
school
building
all
the
buildings
shook
with
the
steady
tremor
of
reeds
in
a
freshet
between
them
the
tops
of
the
maples
level
like
a
shorn
hedge
kept
up
an
immensity
of
tormented
motion
that
invaded
even
the
schoolroom
with
a
sense
of
its
insupportable
fatigues
i
remember
there
were
few
at
their
desks
that
day
and
all
the
discipline
relaxed
by
the
confusion
of
the
wind
at
the
morning
recess
there
had
been
some
debate
about
dismissing
the
session
and
one
of
the
young
teachers
on
the
third
floor
had
grown
hysterical
and
been
reprimanded
by
the
principal
it
must
have
been
about
eleven
of
the
clock
while
i
was
watching
the
little
puffs
of
dust
that
rose
between
the
planks
of
the
flooring
whenever
the
building
shuddered
and
ground
its
teeth
divided
between
an
affectation
of
timorousness
which
seemed
to
grow
in
favour
as
a
suitable
frame
of
behaviour
and
the
rapid
rise
of
every
tingling
sense
to
the
spacious
movement
of
the
weather
and
my
private
dramatization
of
the
demolition
of
the
building
from
which
only
such
occupants
as
i
favoured
should
be
rescued
by
my
signal
behaviour
already
several
children
had
been
abstracted
by
anxious
parents
so
that
i
failed
to
be
even
startled
by
another
knocking
until
my
attention
was
attracted
by
the
teacher
opening
the
door
and
opening
it
wide
upon
my
uncle
alva
i
saw
him
step
back
with
a
motion
of
his
head
sidewise
to
draw
her
after
him
but
it
took
all
the
suggestive
nods
and
winks
that
as
she
drew
it
shut
behind
her
were
focussed
on
my
desk
to
pull
me
up
to
the
realization
that
his
visit
must
have
something
to
do
with
me
it
was
not
in
fact
until
i
was
halfway
down
the
aisle
after
miss
jessel
called
me
that
i
recovered
my
surprise
sufficiently
to
assume
the
mysteriously
important
air
that
was
proper
to
the
fifth
grade
on
being
privileged
to
answer
the
door
there
was
not
i
am
sure
in
the
brief
information
that
i
was
wanted
at
home
one
betraying
syllable
nothing
sufficiently
unusual
in
the
way
miss
jessel
tied
me
into
my
hood
nor
in
finding
effie
tied
into
hers
on
the
first
floor
nor
in
the
way
her
teacher
kissed
her
everybody
kissed
effie
who
was
allowed
nothing
in
forester
having
already
cleared
out
without
waiting
for
us
we
got
into
the
town
in
the
wake
of
uncle
alva
and
between
the
business
blocks
where
the
tall
buildings
abated
the
wind
there
was
no
traffic
in
the
streets
that
day
here
and
there
a
foot
passenger
with
his
hat
held
down
by
both
hands
and
his
coat
tails
between
his
legs
staggered
into
doorways
which
were
snapped
to
behind
him
and
from
the
glass
of
which
faces
looked
out
featureless
in
the
blur
of
the
wind
as
we
passed
the
side
door
of
a
men
clothing
establishment
one
of
these
pale
human
orbs
approached
to
the
pane
exhibited
a
peering
movement
rapped
on
the
glass
and
beckoned
i
know
now
this
must
have
been
the
working
of
an
instinct
to
which
taylorville
was
so
habituated
that
it
seemed
natural
to
uncle
alva
he
was
only
my
mother
half
brother
not
my
father
to
send
us
on
with
a
word
about
overtaking
us
while
he
crossed
the
street
at
the
instance
of
that
beckoning
finger
to
be
chaffered
with
in
the
matter
of
my
father
grave
clothes
all
this
time
there
was
not
a
word
spoken
that
could
convey
to
us
children
the
import
of
our
unexpected
release
we
drifted
down
the
street
effie
and
i
sidling
against
the
blasts
that
drove
furiously
in
the
crossways
and
finally
as
we
caught
our
breath
under
a
long
red
sandstone
building
i
recall
being
taken
violently
as
it
were
by
knowledge
and
crying
out
that
my
father
was
dead
that
he
was
dead
and
i
should
never
see
him
again
i
do
not
know
how
i
knew
but
i
knew
and
effie
accepted
it
she
came
cuddling
up
to
me
in
the
smother
of
the
wind
trying
to
comfort
me
as
if
as
i
think
did
not
occur
to
her
he
had
been
my
father
only
and
not
hers
at
all
i
do
not
recall
very
well
how
we
got
across
the
town
between
the
shut
houses
high
shouldered
with
the
cold
except
that
uncle
alva
did
not
come
up
with
us
and
the
vast
lapping
of
the
wind
that
swirled
us
together
at
intervals
in
a
community
of
breathlessness
seemed
somehow
to
have
grown
out
of
the
occasion
and
be
naturally
commensurate
with
its
desolating
quality
i
do
not
think
it
occurred
to
us
as
strange
that
we
should
have
been
left
so
to
come
to
the
knowledge
that
grew
until
as
we
came
in
sight
of
our
home
we
were
fairly
taken
aback
to
find
it
so
little
altered
from
what
it
had
been
when
we
left
it
three
hours
before
it
had
never
been
an
attractive
house
yellow
painted
with
chocolate
trimmings
and
unshuttered
windows
against
which
the
wind
contrived
it
cowered
in
a
wide
yard
full
of
unpruned
maples
that
now
held
up
their
limbs
protestingly
that
shook
off
from
their
stretched
boughs
disclaimers
of
responsibility
the
very
smoke
wrenched
itself
from
the
chimney
and
escaped
hurryingly
upon
the
wind
the
shrubbery
wrung
itself
whole
flights
of
fallen
leaves
that
had
settled
soddenly
beside
the
borders
all
the
winter
having
at
last
got
a
plain
sight
of
it
whirled
up
aghast
and
fled
along
the
road
the
blinds
were
down
at
the
front
windows
and
no
one
came
in
or
out
i
remember
our
hanging
there
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
for
an
appreciable
interval
before
trusting
ourselves
to
a
usualness
which
every
moment
began
to
appear
more
frightening
and
being
snatched
back
from
the
brink
of
panic
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
in
the
road
behind
us
as
a
light
buggy
all
aglitter
from
point
to
point
of
its
natty
furnishings
drew
up
at
our
gate
and
discharged
from
the
seat
beside
the
driver
a
youngish
man
all
of
a
piece
with
the
turnout
in
the
trim
and
shining
blackness
of
his
exterior
who
with
a
kind
of
subdued
tripping
ran
up
the
walk
and
entered
at
the
door
without
a
knock
i
am
not
sure
that
effie
identified
him
as
the
man
who
had
taken
away
the
babies
indeed
the
two
who
came
after
effie
were
so
close
together
and
went
so
soon
that
i
have
heard
her
say
that
she
has
no
recollection
of
anything
except
a
house
enlivened
by
continuous
baby
but
she
had
the
knowledge
common
to
every
taylorville
child
of
the
undertaker
as
the
only
man
who
was
let
softly
in
at
unknocked
doors
with
his
frock
coat
buttoned
tight
and
the
rim
of
his
black
hat
held
against
his
freshly
shaven
chin
we
snatched
the
knowledge
from
one
another
as
we
caught
hands
together
and
fairly
dove
into
the
side
entrance
that
opened
on
the
living
room
the
first
thing
i
was
aware
of
was
the
sound
of
forester
blubbering
and
then
of
the
place
being
full
of
neighbours
and
my
mother
sitting
by
the
fire
in
a
chair
out
of
the
best
room
crying
heartily
we
flung
ourselves
upon
her
crying
too
and
were
gathered
up
in
a
violence
of
grief
and
rocking
through
which
i
could
hear
a
great
many
voices
in
a
kind
of
frightened
and
extenuating
remonstrance
come
now
lattimore
now
sally
there
there
at
every
word
of
which
my
mother
sobbing
broke
out
afresh
i
remember
getting
done
with
my
crying
first
and
being
very
hot
and
uncomfortable
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
how
i
should
wriggle
out
of
her
embrace
and
get
away
anywhere
to
escape
from
the
burden
of
having
to
seem
to
care
and
then
but
whether
it
was
immediately
after
i
am
not
sure
going
rather
heavily
upstairs
and
being
overtaken
in
the
middle
of
it
by
the
dramatic
suggestion
of
myself
as
an
orphan
child
toiling
through
the
world
i
dare
say
i
had
read
something
like
that
recently
and
carrying
out
the
suggestion
with
an
immense
effect
on
uncle
alva
who
happened
to
be
coming
down
at
that
moment
and
then
the
insidious
spread
through
all
my
soul
of
cold
disaster
out
of
which
i
found
myself
unable
to
rise
even
to
the
appearance
of
how
much
i
cared
of
all
that
time
my
father
lay
dead
in
the
best
room
for
by
the
usual
taylorville
procedure
the
funeral
could
not
take
place
until
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
i
have
only
snatches
of
remembrance
of
my
being
taken
in
to
look
at
him
as
he
lay
in
the
coffin
in
a
very
nice
coat
which
i
had
never
seen
him
wear
and
the
sudden
conviction
i
had
of
its
somehow
being
connected
with
that
mysterious
summons
which
had
taken
uncle
alva
away
from
us
that
morning
in
the
street
of
the
sitting
up
which
was
done
both
nights
by
groups
of
neighbours
mostly
young
and
the
festive
air
it
had
with
the
table
spread
with
the
best
cloth
and
notable
delicacies
and
mine
and
forester
reprisals
against
one
another
as
to
the
impropriety
of
squabbling
over
the
remains
of
a
layer
cake
and
particularly
of
cousin
judd
he
came
about
dusk
from
the
farm
he
had
been
sent
for
looking
shocked
and
yet
with
a
kind
of
enjoyable
solemnity
i
thought
and
the
first
thing
he
wished
to
do
was
to
pray
with
my
poor
mother
we
must
submit
ourselves
to
the
will
of
god
sally
he
urged
o
god
said
my
mother
walking
up
and
down
i
not
so
sure
god
had
anything
to
do
with
it
it
a
wrong
spirit
sally
a
wrong
spirit
a
spirit
of
rebellion
my
mother
began
to
cry
why
could
god
have
left
him
alone
what
had
he
done
that
he
should
be
taken
away
what
have
done
you
must
take
it
like
this
sally
think
of
your
duty
to
your
children
lord
giveth
go
tell
him
to
give
me
back
my
husband
then
effie
and
i
cowered
in
our
corner
between
the
base
burner
and
the
sewing
machine
it
was
terrible
to
hear
them
so
quarrelling
about
god
my
mother
had
her
hands
to
her
head
as
she
walked
her
figure
touched
by
the
firelight
not
quite
spoiled
by
childbearing
looked
young
to
me
oh
oh
oh
she
cried
with
every
step
you
must
sally
you
be
punished
for
it
cousin
judd
shook
with
excitement
he
was
bullying
her
about
her
christian
submission
i
went
up
to
him
suddenly
and
struck
him
on
the
arm
with
my
fist
you
let
her
alone
i
cried
let
her
alone
somebody
spoke
out
sharply
i
think
a
hand
plucked
me
from
behind
to
my
amazement
my
mother
olivia
olivia
may
i
surprised
and
your
father
not
out
of
the
house
yet
go
up
to
your
room
and
see
if
you
ca
learn
to
control
yourself
after
all
there
was
some
excuse
for
cousin
judd
there
was
in
the
general
estimate
something
more
than
fortuitous
circumstance
that
went
to
my
father
taking
off
early
in
the
winter
when
work
had
been
stopped
on
the
zimmern
building
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
some
local
regulations
as
to
the
removal
of
scaffolding
and
the
security
of
foot
passengers
that
the
contractors
had
not
been
brought
to
book
about
it
was
thought
to
be
due
to
official
connivance
my
father
had
written
to
the
paper
about
it
but
the
scaffolding
had
remained
until
that
morning
of
the
high
wind
when
it
came
down
all
together
and
a
bit
of
the
wall
with
it
that
my
father
should
have
been
passing
on
his
way
to
the
courthouse
at
the
moment
was
a
leaping
together
of
circumstances
that
seemed
somehow
to
have
raised
it
to
the
plane
of
a
moral
instance
it
provided
just
that
element
of
the
dramatic
in
human
affairs
which
somehow
wakens
the
conviction
of
having
always
expected
it
though
it
hardly
appeared
why
my
father
rather
than
the
contractor
or
the
convincing
city
official
should
have
been
the
victim
if
it
was
an
act
of
providence
it
was
so
like
one
that
it
contributed
to
bring
out
to
the
funeral
more
people
than
might
otherwise
have
ventured
themselves
in
such
weather
it
was
also
thought
that
if
anything
of
that
nature
could
have
made
up
to
her
my
mother
should
have
found
much
to
console
her
in
the
funeral
the
masons
took
part
in
it
as
also
the
and
the
republican
club
though
they
might
have
made
a
more
imposing
show
of
numbers
if
all
the
societies
had
not
been
so
largely
composed
of
the
same
members
in
addition
to
all
this
my
mother
crape
came
quite
to
the
hem
of
her
dress
and
effie
and
i
had
new
hats
i
remember
those
hats
very
well
they
had
very
tall
crowns
and
narrow
brims
and
velvet
trimmings
and
we
tried
them
on
for
pauline
allingham
after
we
had
gone
up
to
bed
the
night
before
the
funeral
allingham
had
called
and
pauline
had
been
allowed
to
come
up
to
us
i
remember
her
asking
how
we
felt
and
being
as
much
impressed
by
the
way
in
which
i
carried
off
the
situation
as
if
she
had
not
been
in
the
least
concerned
in
it
and
then
we
sat
up
in
bed
in
our
nightgowns
and
tried
on
the
hats
while
pauline
walked
about
to
get
the
effect
from
both
sides
and
refrained
in
respect
to
the
occasion
from
offering
any
criticism
it
was
the
evening
after
the
funeral
and
everybody
had
gone
away
but
one
good
neighbour
the
room
had
been
set
in
order
while
we
were
away
at
the
cemetery
the
lamp
was
lit
and
there
was
a
red
glow
on
everything
from
the
deep
heart
of
the
base
burner
the
woman
went
about
softly
to
set
a
meal
for
us
and
under
the
lamp
there
was
a
great
bowl
of
quince
marmalade
which
she
had
brought
over
neighbourly
from
her
own
stores
the
colour
of
it
played
through
the
clear
glass
like
a
stain
upon
the
white
cloth
it
happened
to
have
been
a
favourite
dish
of
my
father
for
the
last
year
it
had
been
a
family
use
he
being
delicate
in
his
appetite
to
make
a
point
of
saving
for
him
anything
which
he
might
possibly
eat
and
taking
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
his
enjoyment
therefore
it
came
quite
natural
for
me
to
get
a
small
dish
from
the
cupboard
and
begin
to
serve
out
a
portion
of
mason
preserves
for
my
father
all
at
once
it
came
over
me
the
meaning
of
bereavement
that
there
was
nobody
to
be
done
for
tenderly
the
loss
of
it
the
need
of
the
heart
for
all
its
offices
of
loving
and
the
unavailing
pain
chapter
v
it
followed
soon
on
my
father
death
that
we
gave
up
the
yellow
house
with
the
chocolate
trimmings
and
took
another
near
the
high
school
and
that
very
summer
my
mother
lengthened
my
skirts
halfway
to
my
shoe
tops
and
began
to
find
fault
with
my
behaviour
for
a
girl
of
your
age
we
saw
no
more
of
the
mcgees
after
that
except
as
ellen
managed
to
keep
on
in
the
same
class
at
school
with
me
and
pauline
and
i
found
ourselves
with
a
bosom
friendship
on
our
hands
i
went
on
missing
my
father
terribly
but
in
a
child
inarticulate
fashion
and
it
is
only
lately
that
i
have
realized
how
much
of
my
life
went
at
loose
ends
for
the
loss
out
of
it
of
a
man
point
of
view
and
the
appreciable
standards
which
grow
out
of
his
relation
to
the
community
ever
since
the
snockerty
episode
there
had
been
glimmers
on
my
horizon
of
the
sort
of
rightness
owing
from
a
daughter
of
henry
lattimore
but
now
that
i
had
no
longer
the
use
of
the
personal
instance
i
lost
all
notion
of
what
those
things
might
be
for
though
i
have
often
heard
my
mother
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
best
women
in
the
world
she
was
the
last
to
have
provided
me
with
a
definite
pattern
of
behaviour
pauline
had
struck
out
a
sort
of
social
balance
for
herself
grounded
on
the
fear
of
what
was
common
her
mother
had
a
day
at
home
from
which
seemed
to
flow
an
orderly
perspective
of
social
observances
for
which
my
mother
never
having
arrived
at
the
pitch
of
visiting
cards
afforded
me
no
criterion
whatever
she
had
been
a
farmer
daughter
in
another
part
of
the
state
and
had
done
something
for
herself
in
the
way
of
school
teaching
before
she
married
my
father
my
grandparents
i
never
saw
but
i
seem
to
recall
at
such
public
occasions
as
county
fairs
and
soldiers
reunions
certain
tall
men
and
their
badly
dressed
wives
who
called
her
cousin
and
were
answered
by
their
christian
names
whom
i
understand
to
be
my
mother
relatives
without
accepting
them
as
mine
they
were
all
soldiers
though
the
men
of
our
family
you
saw
it
at
once
in
the
odd
stiffness
sitting
on
their
farmer
carriage
like
the
firm
strokes
of
a
master
on
a
pupil
smudged
drawing
i
think
i
got
my
first
notion
of
the
quality
of
experience
in
the
way
they
exalted
themselves
in
the
memories
of
marches
and
battles
there
had
been
a
station
of
the
underground
railway
not
ten
miles
from
taylorville
and
there
had
gone
out
from
the
town
at
the
first
call
a
volunteer
company
with
so
many
judds
and
wilsons
and
lattimores
on
the
roster
that
it
read
like
the
record
of
a
family
bible
they
had
gone
out
from
they
had
come
back
to
a
life
as
little
relieved
by
adventure
as
the
flat
horizon
of
their
corn
lands
but
in
the
interim
they
had
stretched
themselves
endured
conquered
i
have
heard
political
economists
of
the
cross
roads
account
variously
for
the
prosperity
of
ohianna
in
the
decade
following
the
civil
outbreak
but
i
have
never
heard
it
laid
to
the
revitalizing
of
our
common
stock
by
the
shock
of
its
moral
strenuosities
to
this
day
i
question
whether
cousin
judd
got
more
out
of
his
religion
than
out
of
this
most
unchristian
experience
from
which
he
had
come
back
silver
tipped
as
it
were
from
that
emperym
into
which
men
pass
when
they
are
by
great
emotions
a
little
removed
from
themselves
to
kindle
in
my
young
mind
a
realization
of
the
preciousness
of
passion
over
all
human
assets
it
came
to
me
however
in
the
years
between
twelve
and
fifteen
that
my
mother
relations
did
things
with
their
knives
and
neglected
others
with
their
forks
that
were
not
done
in
circles
that
by
virtue
of
just
such
observances
got
themselves
called
good
society
i
was
aware
of
a
sort
of
gracelessness
in
their
vital
processes
in
much
the
same
way
that
i
knew
that
the
striped
and
flowered
carpet
in
my
mother
best
room
did
not
harmonize
with
the
wall
paper
and
that
the
curtains
went
badly
with
them
both
i
have
to
go
back
to
this
and
to
the
fact
that
my
clothes
were
chosen
for
wearing
qualities
rather
than
becomingness
to
account
for
a
behaviour
that
as
i
began
to
emerge
from
the
illumined
mists
of
play
my
mother
complained
of
under
the
head
of
my
not
taking
an
interest
how
else
was
i
to
protect
myself
from
the
thousand
inharmonies
that
chafed
against
the
budding
instinct
of
beauty
the
ribbons
i
was
expected
to
wear
with
my
brown
dress
the
mottled
japanese
pattern
upon
the
gilt
ground
of
the
wall
paper
against
which
i
had
pushed
out
a
kind
of
shell
hung
within
with
the
glittering
stuff
of
dreams
for
just
about
the
time
i
should
have
been
absorbed
in
cousin
beaded
dolman
and
the
turning
of
my
mother
one
silk
i
was
regularly
victimized
by
the
fits
and
starts
of
temperament
instinctive
efforts
toward
the
rehearsal
of
greater
passions
than
had
appeared
above
my
horizon
flashes
of
red
and
blue
and
gold
thrown
up
on
the
plain
taylorville
surface
of
my
behaviour
with
the
result
of
putting
me
at
odds
with
the
taylorvillians
it
was
as
if
being
required
to
produce
a
character
i
found
myself
with
samples
of
a
great
many
sorts
on
my
hands
which
i
kept
offering
hopeful
that
they
might
be
found
to
match
with
the
acceptable
article
which
i
may
say
here
they
never
did
they
were
good
samples
too
considering
how
young
i
was
of
the
magdas
ophelias
antigones
i
was
yet
to
become
of
the
great
lady
good
comrade
and
lover
but
the
most
i
got
by
it
was
the
suspicion
of
insincerity
and
affectation
i
sensitively
suffered
the
more
from
it
as
i
was
conscious
of
the
veering
of
this
inward
direction
without
being
able
to
prove
what
i
was
sure
of
its
relevance
to
the
shining
destiny
toward
which
i
moved
if
you
ask
how
this
assurance
differed
from
the
general
human
hope
of
a
superior
happiness
i
can
only
say
that
the
event
has
proved
it
and
as
early
as
i
was
aware
of
it
moved
me
childishly
to
acts
of
propitiation
i
wanted
gratefully
to
be
good
with
a
goodness
acceptable
to
the
powers
from
which
such
assurance
flowed
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
separate
my
notion
of
this
from
my
earliest
ideal
of
what
would
have
been
suitable
behaviour
to
my
father
so
that
all
the
upward
reach
of
adolescence
was
tinged
by
my
sense
of
loss
in
him
it
was
when
i
was
about
thirteen
and
had
not
yet
forgotten
how
my
father
looked
that
i
made
an
important
discovery
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
church
and
close
to
the
amen
corner
sat
a
man
with
something
in
the
cut
of
his
beard
in
the
swing
of
his
shoulders
at
which
some
dying
nerve
started
suddenly
athrob
i
must
have
seen
him
there
a
great
many
times
without
noticing
and
perhaps
the
likeness
was
not
so
much
as
i
had
thought
and
i
had
had
to
wait
until
my
recollection
faded
to
its
note
of
faint
suggestion
but
from
that
day
i
took
to
going
out
of
my
way
to
school
to
pass
by
gower
place
of
business
for
the
sake
of
the
start
of
memory
that
for
the
moment
brought
my
father
near
again
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
mention
to
my
mother
that
i
liked
sitting
in
church
where
i
could
look
at
gower
because
he
reminded
me
of
somebody
we
were
on
our
way
home
on
sunday
night
we
were
always
taken
to
church
twice
on
sunday
forester
was
on
ahead
with
effie
and
just
as
we
came
along
under
the
shadow
of
the
spool
factory
i
had
reached
up
to
tuck
my
hand
under
my
mother
arm
and
make
my
timid
suggestion
well
somebody
who
said
my
mother
of
my
father
oh
said
my
mother
that
just
your
fancy
but
she
did
not
shake
off
my
hand
from
her
arm
as
was
her
habit
toward
proffers
of
affection
and
the
moment
passed
for
one
of
confidence
between
us
i
was
convinced
that
she
must
have
taken
notice
of
the
likeness
for
herself
that
was
in
the
spring
and
all
that
summer
vacation
i
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
playing
with
nettie
gower
for
the
sake
of
seeing
her
father
come
at
the
gate
about
five
in
the
afternoon
the
way
mine
had
done
nettie
was
not
an
attractive
child
and
of
an
age
better
suited
to
effie
who
could
bear
her
the
relation
it
seemed
wanted
an
explanation
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
so
long
as
i
withheld
my
own
another
would
be
found
for
it
nettie
brother
found
it
about
the
time
that
my
friendship
with
his
sister
was
at
its
most
flourishing
he
was
no
nicer
than
you
would
expect
a
brother
of
nettie
to
be
though
he
was
in
a
way
with
a
flattened
curl
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
and
of
late
he
had
taken
to
hanging
about
nettie
and
me
looking
at
me
with
a
curious
sort
of
smirk
that
i
was
not
quite
arrived
at
knowing
for
the
beginning
gallantry
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
i
did
not
come
to
see
nettie
because
i
was
fond
of
her
but
it
was
yet
for
me
to
discover
that
he
thought
it
was
because
i
was
fond
of
him
i
remember
i
was
making
a
bower
in
the
asparagus
bed
i
was
too
old
to
play
in
the
asparagus
bed
but
i
was
making
a
point
of
being
good
enough
to
do
it
on
nettie
account
and
i
had
asked
charlie
for
his
knife
to
cut
the
stems
come
and
get
it
he
was
holding
it
out
to
me
hollowed
in
his
palm
and
he
would
not
let
go
my
hand
you
do
want
no
knife
he
leered
sickeningly
i
know
what
you
want
suddenly
i
caught
sight
of
nettie
face
with
its
straight
thick
plaits
of
hair
and
eyes
narrowed
at
me
behind
her
glasses
and
it
struck
me
all
at
once
that
she
had
never
taken
my
interest
in
her
seriously
either
well
what
i
began
defensively
this
he
thrust
out
his
face
toward
mine
but
i
was
too
quick
for
him
that
was
my
first
sex
encounter
and
it
did
somehow
make
it
any
the
less
exasperating
to
realize
that
what
lay
behind
my
sudden
interest
in
nettie
could
now
be
brought
forward
in
extenuation
but
i
am
always
glad
that
i
slapped
charlie
gower
before
the
paralyzing
sense
of
being
trapped
by
my
own
behaviour
overtook
me
i
had
found
the
words
yet
for
the
unimagined
disgust
of
the
boy
impertinence
when
as
i
was
helping
to
wipe
the
dishes
that
evening
after
supper
i
tried
to
put
it
to
my
mother
on
a
new
basis
which
the
incident
seemed
to
have
created
of
our
being
somehow
ranged
together
against
such
offences
it
was
the
time
for
us
to
have
emerged
a
little
from
the
family
relation
to
the
freemasonry
of
sex
but
my
mother
missed
knowing
it
i
am
not
going
to
nettie
gower
any
more
i
began
no
said
my
mother
and
of
course
i
could
not
conceive
that
she
had
forgotten
the
confidence
in
which
the
connection
with
nettie
began
that
charlie
i
just
hate
him
you
know
he
thought
i
was
coming
to
see
nettie
because
of
him
well
said
my
mother
turning
out
the
dishwater
perhaps
you
were
and
that
i
think
it
safe
to
say
is
as
near
as
my
family
ever
came
to
understanding
the
processes
at
work
behind
the
incidents
of
my
growing
up
yet
i
think
my
mother
very
often
did
know
that
the
key
to
my
behaviour
did
not
lie
in
the
obvious
explanation
of
it
and
a
sort
of
aversion
toward
what
was
strange
which
i
have
come
to
think
of
as
growing
out
of
her
unsophistication
kept
her
from
admitting
it
it
was
less
disconcerting
to
have
my
springs
of
action
accounted
for
on
the
basis
of
what
allingham
would
have
called
common
than
to
have
it
arraigned
by
her
own
standard
as
queer
there
was
always
in
taylorville
a
certain
caddishness
toward
innovations
of
conduct
which
we
youngsters
railed
at
as
countrified
which
i
now
perceive
to
have
been
no
worse
than
the
instinctive
movement
to
lessen
by
despising
it
the
terror
the
deep
terror
of
the
unknown
the
incident
served
however
to
supersede
with
resentment
the
sense
of
personal
definite
loss
in
which
it
had
begun
before
the
year
was
out
i
had
so
far
forgotten
my
father
that
i
saw
no
resemblance
to
him
in
gower
and
would
not
have
recognized
it
had
i
met
it
anywhere
though
the
want
of
fathering
had
its
share
no
doubt
in
landing
me
as
i
cast
about
for
an
appreciable
rule
to
live
by
in
what
i
have
already
described
as
a
superior
sort
of
snockertism
the
immediate
step
to
it
was
my
getting
converted
that
very
winter
all
taylorville
and
the
six
townships
were
caught
up
in
one
of
those
acute
emotional
crises
called
a
revival
it
had
begun
in
the
methodist
and
gradually
involved
the
whole
number
of
protestant
churches
and
had
overflowed
into
the
congregational
building
as
affording
the
greatest
seating
room
by
the
middle
of
february
it
was
possible
to
feel
through
the
whole
community
the
ground
swell
of
its
disturbances
night
after
night
the
people
poured
in
to
it
to
be
flayed
in
spirit
striped
agonized
exalted
at
the
hands
of
a
practised
evangelist
which
they
as
it
had
the
cachet
of
being
supernaturally
good
for
them
they
liked
it
with
a
deeper
more
enjoyment
than
the
operas
theatres
social
adventure
of
cities
supposing
they
had
been
at
hand
it
hardly
seems
possible
with
all
she
had
to
do
and
yet
i
think
my
mother
could
not
have
missed
one
of
those
meetings
going
regularly
with
cousin
judd
who
drove
in
from
the
farm
more
times
than
you
would
have
thought
the
farm
could
have
spared
him
or
with
forester
who
had
been
converted
the
winter
before
though
i
think
he
must
have
regretted
the
smaller
occasion
left
at
home
with
effie
who
was
thought
too
young
to
be
benefited
by
the
preaching
and
too
old
to
be
laid
by
in
an
overcoat
on
the
benches
with
dozens
of
others
heavy
with
sleep
and
the
vitiated
air
late
when
i
had
finished
my
arithmetic
and
was
afraid
to
go
to
bed
in
the
empty
house
i
would
open
the
window
a
crack
toward
the
blur
on
the
night
from
the
tall
shutterless
windows
of
the
church
and
catch
the
faint
swell
of
the
hymns
and
at
times
the
hysteric
shout
of
some
sinner
coming
through
and
i
was
as
drawn
to
it
as
any
savage
to
the
roll
of
the
medicine
drums
the
backwash
of
this
excitement
penetrated
even
to
the
schoolroom
as
from
time
to
time
some
awed
whisper
ran
of
this
and
that
one
of
our
classmates
being
converted
and
walking
apart
from
us
with
the
other
saved
in
a
chastened
mystery
and
finally
pauline
allingham
and
i
talked
it
over
and
decided
to
get
converted
too
pauline
i
remember
had
not
been
allowed
to
attend
the
meetings
and
considered
her
spiritual
welfare
jeopardized
in
the
prohibition
we
knew
by
this
time
perfectly
well
what
we
had
to
do
and
had
arranged
to
get
excused
from
our
respective
rooms
pauline
was
a
grade
behind
me
on
account
of
diphtheria
the
previous
winter
and
to
meet
in
the
abandoned
between
the
boys
and
girls
basement
pauline
who
had
always
an
aptitude
for
proselyting
brought
another
girl
from
the
sixth
grade
who
was
also
under
conviction
we
had
the
terms
very
pat
a
thin
girl
who
joined
the
baptist
church
and
afterward
married
a
minister
so
that
she
might
very
easily
have
reckoned
the
incident
at
something
like
its
supposititious
value
in
her
life
i
remember
that
we
knelt
down
in
the
dusty
where
the
little
children
used
to
play
and
prayed
by
turns
for
light
aloud
at
first
and
then
as
we
felt
the
approach
of
the
compelling
mood
silently
as
we
waited
for
the
moment
after
which
we
might
rather
put
it
over
our
classmates
on
the
strength
of
our
salvation
it
came
oh
it
came
the
sweep
up
and
out
the
dizzying
lightness
not
very
different
in
fact
from
the
breathless
rush
with
which
on
a
first
night
of
or
i
have
felt
my
part
meet
me
as
i
cross
between
the
wings
the
lift
the
tremor
of
passion
oh
i
said
i
saved
i
saved
i
know
it
so
am
i
said
flora
haines
i
was
a
long
time
ago
but
i
did
like
to
say
anything
and
if
i
had
just
been
converted
i
should
have
thought
it
rather
mean
of
her
in
the
dusk
of
the
we
heard
pauline
sniffling
i
suppose
it
because
i
so
much
worse
a
sinner
she
admitted
but
i
just
ca
feel
it
you
must
give
yourself
into
the
lord
hands
pauline
dear
flora
haines
had
heard
the
evangelist
i
began
to
offer
myself
passionately
in
prayer
as
a
vicarious
atonement
for
pauline
shortcomings
do
you
feel
anything
flora
urged
not
the
least
thing
well
sort
of
something
pauline
confessed
well
of
course
that
it
yes
that
it
i
insisted
well
i
suppose
it
is
pauline
gave
in
mopping
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
but
it
is
the
least
like
what
i
expected
we
heard
the
school
clock
strike
the
quarter
hour
and
got
up
brushing
our
knees
rather
guiltily
flora
haines
and
i
were
kept
in
all
that
afternoon
recess
for
exceeding
our
excuse
but
pauline
saved
herself
by
bursting
into
tears
as
soon
as
she
reached
her
room
and
being
sent
home
with
a
headache
that
was
on
thursday
and
saturday
afternoon
we
were
all
to
meet
at
our
house
and
go
together
to
a
great
children
meeting
where
we
were
expected
to
announce
that
we
were
saved
pauline
was
a
little
late
i
was
explaining
to
flora
haines
that
i
was
to
join
our
church
on
probation
on
sunday
but
flora
being
a
baptist
had
been
put
off
by
her
minister
until
the
revival
should
be
over
and
he
could
attend
to
all
the
baptisms
at
once
we
naturally
expected
something
similar
from
pauline
i
hardly
think
she
said
stroking
her
muff
and
looking
very
ladylike
that
i
shall
take
such
an
important
step
in
life
until
i
am
older
but
i
objected
how
can
anything
be
more
important
it
your
pauline
flora
haines
was
slightly
scandalized
that
just
the
reason
it
so
important
my
mother
thinks
i
ought
not
to
take
any
steps
until
i
can
give
it
my
most
mature
judgment
flora
haines
and
i
looked
at
one
another
silently
we
might
have
known
pauline
mother
would
let
her
do
anything
so
common
as
get
converted
chapter
vi
i
was
duly
taken
into
the
church
on
the
following
sabbath
to
the
great
relief
of
my
family
having
for
once
exhibited
the
normal
reaction
of
a
young
person
in
my
circumstances
and
though
i
have
laid
much
to
the
door
of
that
institution
of
the
retarding
of
my
development
and
the
dimming
of
the
delicate
surface
of
happiness
i
think
now
it
was
not
wholly
bad
for
me
if
i
had
up
to
this
time
found
any
way
of
being
good
by
myself
i
was
now
provided
with
a
criterion
of
conduct
toward
which
even
those
who
had
been
able
to
manage
it
for
themselves
moved
a
public
approbation
i
have
heard
my
mother
say
that
even
farley
the
banker
who
read
books
on
evolution
and
was
a
freethinker
opprobrious
term
had
been
known
to
pronounce
the
church
an
excellent
thing
for
women
the
church
left
you
in
no
doubt
about
things
you
attended
morning
and
evening
service
as
soon
as
you
were
old
enough
for
it
which
was
before
you
were
fit
you
taught
in
sunday
school
you
waited
on
table
at
oyster
suppers
designed
for
the
raising
of
the
minister
salary
and
if
you
had
any
talent
for
it
you
sang
in
the
choir
or
recited
things
at
the
church
sociables
and
when
you
were
married
and
consequently
you
joined
the
and
the
sewing
society
it
was
after
the
incident
of
the
that
i
began
to
experience
this
easy
irreproachability
and
to
build
out
of
its
materials
a
sort
of
extra
self
from
which
afterward
to
burst
was
the
bitter
wound
of
life
for
my
particular
church
went
farther
and
provided
a
chart
for
all
the
of
behaviour
you
were
never
said
the
evangelist
whose
relish
of
the
situation
on
the
day
that
a
score
or
so
of
us
had
renounced
the
devil
and
all
his
works
gave
me
a
vague
sensation
of
having
made
a
meal
and
licked
his
lips
over
us
you
should
never
go
anywhere
that
you
could
not
take
your
saviour
with
you
and
when
i
saw
cousin
judd
wag
at
my
mother
and
she
smile
and
pat
her
hymn
book
i
was
apprised
that
we
had
come
to
the
root
of
the
whole
matter
i
have
wondered
since
to
how
many
young
converts
in
ohianna
that
phrase
has
been
handed
out
and
with
what
blighting
consequences
for
a
saviour
as
i
knew
him
at
thirteen
and
a
half
was
a
solemn
presence
that
ran
in
your
mind
with
the
bleakness
of
plain
whitewashed
walls
and
hard
benches
and
a
general
hush
a
vague
sensation
of
your
chest
being
too
tight
for
you
and
a
little
of
the
feeling
you
had
when
you
had
gone
to
call
at
the
allinghams
and
had
forgotten
to
wipe
your
feet
and
it
was
manifest
if
you
took
that
incubus
everywhere
you
went
you
would
have
any
fun
it
was
fortunate
at
that
time
that
it
was
not
the
desire
for
entertainment
that
moved
me
so
much
as
the
need
of
my
youth
to
serve
the
unparented
hunger
for
authority
but
with
the
pressure
of
that
environment
if
there
had
been
anybody
with
the
wit
to
see
where
my
gift
lay
what
anybody
could
have
done
about
it
it
is
difficult
to
say
when
all
that
taylorville
afforded
of
the
proper
food
of
gift
brightness
music
and
the
dance
was
of
so
forlorn
a
quality
it
has
been
a
question
if
i
do
not
owe
the
church
some
thanks
for
cutting
out
the
possible
cheapening
of
taste
and
the
satisfaction
of
applause
that
is
if
gift
can
be
hurt
at
all
by
what
happens
to
the
possessor
it
can
be
cramped
and
enfeebled
in
expression
rendered
tormenting
in
its
passage
and
futile
to
the
recipient
but
to
whom
it
comes
its
supernal
quality
rises
forever
beyond
all
attainder
what
happened
to
the
actress
during
all
the
time
i
was
undertaken
by
the
church
to
be
made
into
the
sort
of
woman
serviceable
to
taylorville
was
inconsiderable
what
grew
out
of
it
for
olivia
was
no
small
matter
and
much
of
it
i
lay
without
bitterness
to
cousin
judd
who
from
having
got
himself
named
adviser
in
my
father
will
was
in
a
position
to
affect
my
life
to
the
worse
and
yet
in
so
far
as
i
am
not
an
unprecedented
sport
on
the
family
tree
i
had
more
in
common
with
this
soldier
cousin
than
with
any
of
my
kin
though
i
should
hardly
say
as
much
to
him
for
he
has
never
been
in
a
theatre
and
if
he
still
considers
me
a
hopeful
subject
for
prayer
it
is
because
his
christian
duty
rises
superior
to
his
conviction
he
is
pricked
out
in
my
earlier
recollections
by
the
difficulty
he
seems
to
have
had
in
effecting
a
compromise
between
the
traditional
distrustfulness
of
the
ohianna
farmer
toward
the
powers
in
general
and
particularly
of
the
weather
and
his
obligation
of
christian
joy
and
for
a
curious
effect
of
not
belonging
to
his
wife
a
large
uninteresting
woman
with
a
sense
of
her
own
merit
which
she
never
succeeded
in
imposing
on
anybody
but
cousin
judd
she
had
a
keen
appreciation
of
worldly
values
which
led
her
always
to
select
the
best
material
for
her
clothes
and
another
feeling
of
their
expensiveness
which
resulted
in
her
being
always
a
little
belated
in
the
styles
she
approved
of
religion
though
not
active
in
it
and
in
twenty
years
she
and
cousin
judd
had
arrived
at
a
series
of
compromises
and
excuses
which
enabled
her
to
appear
at
church
one
sunday
in
five
and
still
keep
up
the
interest
of
the
clergyman
and
congregation
as
to
why
she
did
come
the
other
four
whenever
the
days
were
short
or
the
roads
too
heavy
cousin
judd
would
put
up
over
night
at
our
house
and
i
remember
how
my
mother
would
always
be
able
to
say
looking
about
the
empty
democrat
wagon
as
though
she
expected
her
in
ambush
somewhere
and
you
did
bring
lydia
and
cousin
judd
being
able
to
reply
to
it
as
if
it
were
something
he
had
expected
up
till
the
last
moment
and
been
keenly
disappointed
well
no
liddy
ai
feeling
quite
up
to
it
which
my
mother
received
without
skepticism
after
this
they
were
free
to
talk
of
other
things
what
there
was
between
cousin
judd
and
me
with
due
allowance
for
the
years
was
the
spark
the
of
vitality
that
rose
in
me
to
a
hundred
beckonings
of
running
flood
and
waving
boughs
music
and
movement
and
only
the
moral
enthusiasms
of
war
and
religion
raised
through
his
heavy
farmer
stuff
we
should
have
loved
one
another
had
we
known
how
as
it
was
all
our
intercourse
was
marked
on
his
part
by
the
gracelessness
of
rusticity
and
by
the
impertinence
of
adolescence
on
mine
i
used
regularly
to
receive
his
pious
admonitions
with
what
for
a
taylorville
child
was
flippancy
nevertheless
there
were
occasions
when
we
had
set
off
of
summer
sunday
mornings
together
to
early
class
when
the
church
was
cool
and
dim
and
the
smell
of
the
honey
locusts
came
in
through
the
window
that
i
caught
the
thrill
that
ran
from
the
pounding
of
his
fist
where
he
prayed
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
bench
and
there
was
a
kind
of
blessedness
shed
from
him
as
with
closed
eyes
and
lifted
chin
he
swung
from
peak
to
peak
of
the
splendid
measure
of
how
firm
a
foundation
that
i
garnered
up
and
hugged
to
myself
in
place
of
art
and
the
joy
of
living
all
of
which
was
very
good
for
me
and
might
have
answered
if
it
had
not
come
into
cousin
judd
head
that
he
ought
to
overlook
my
reading
by
this
time
i
had
worked
through
all
my
father
books
and
was
ready
to
satisfy
the
itch
of
imagination
even
with
the
vicious
inaccuracies
of
what
was
called
christian
literature
the
trouble
all
came
of
course
of
my
not
understanding
the
nature
of
a
lie
not
that
i
could
tell
a
downright
fib
if
i
had
to
or
have
on
occasion
but
a
lie
is
to
me
just
as
silly
a
performance
when
it
is
about
marriage
or
work
as
about
the
law
of
gravitation
and
when
it
is
presented
to
me
in
the
form
of
human
behaviour
it
makes
me
sick
like
the
smell
of
tuberoses
in
a
close
room
and
i
failed
utterly
to
realize
then
that
there
are
a
great
many
people
capable
of
living
sincerely
and
at
the
same
time
blandly
misrepresenting
the
facts
of
life
in
the
interests
of
what
is
called
morality
i
do
not
think
it
probable
that
cousin
judd
accepted
for
himself
the
rule
of
behaviour
prescribed
by
the
books
he
recommended
i
shall
not
tell
you
what
they
were
but
if
there
are
any
libraries
in
ohianna
you
will
find
them
on
the
shelves
but
i
know
that
he
and
my
mother
esteemed
them
excellent
for
the
young
so
far
as
they
thought
of
it
at
all
they
believed
that
in
surrounding
me
with
intimations
of
a
life
in
which
there
was
nothing
more
important
than
settling
with
deity
the
minor
details
of
living
and
especially
how
much
you
would
pay
to
his
establishment
they
had
done
their
utmost
to
provide
me
with
a
life
in
which
nothing
more
important
could
happen
if
you
were
careful
about
reading
the
bible
and
doing
good
to
people
that
is
persuading
them
to
go
to
church
and
to
leave
off
swearing
all
the
more
serious
details
such
as
making
a
living
marrying
and
having
children
would
take
care
of
themselves
and
the
trouble
was
as
i
have
said
that
i
believed
it
and
that
was
how
i
found
myself
farthest
from
art
and
life
at
the
time
when
i
found
myself
a
young
lady
i
had
to
make
this
discovery
for
myself
for
there
were
no
social
occasions
in
taylorville
to
give
a
term
to
your
advent
into
the
world
though
there
was
a
definite
privilege
which
marked
your
achievement
of
it
there
was
a
period
prior
to
this
in
which
you
bumped
against
things
you
were
too
old
for
and
carromed
to
the
things
for
which
you
were
quite
too
young
and
about
the
end
of
your
term
you
had
done
with
hair
ribbons
and
begun
to
have
company
on
your
own
account
and
the
sort
of
things
began
to
happen
which
marked
the
point
beyond
which
if
you
fell
upon
disaster
it
was
your
own
fault
they
happened
to
me
by
dint
of
my
doing
her
compositions
and
of
her
doing
my
arithmetic
pauline
allingham
and
i
had
managed
to
keep
together
all
through
the
high
school
and
it
was
in
our
last
year
when
we
used
to
put
in
the
long
end
of
the
afternoons
at
pauline
playing
croquet
that
i
first
took
notice
of
tommy
bettersworth
the
bettersworth
yard
abutted
on
the
allingham
for
the
space
of
one
woodshed
and
a
tree
and
it
was
along
in
october
that
i
began
to
be
aware
that
it
was
not
altogether
the
view
of
the
garden
that
kept
tommy
on
the
woodshed
or
in
the
chestnut
tree
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
it
may
be
that
the
adventure
with
charlie
gower
had
sharpened
my
perception
at
any
rate
it
had
aroused
my
discretion
i
was
carefully
oblivious
to
the
proximity
of
tommy
bettersworth
but
there
came
a
day
when
pauline
was
not
when
she
wanted
to
tell
me
something
about
flora
haines
which
she
was
afraid
he
might
overhear
come
around
to
the
she
said
tommy
always
hanging
about
i
ca
think
what
makes
him
always
i
suggested
why
you
know
yourself
he
was
there
last
saturday
and
thursday
when
we
is
he
there
when
you
and
flora
are
there
or
only
oh
pauline
gave
a
gasp
no
oh
i
never
thought
olive
i
do
believe
that
it
well
what
it
olive
solemnly
it
must
be
that
he
really
is
pauline
reading
included
more
romance
than
mine
well
he
ca
say
i
gave
him
any
encouragement
oh
not
darling
pauline
was
sympathetic
you
could
it
is
interesting
what
would
the
girls
say
pauline
if
you
ever
truly
i
never
will
but
just
but
we
reckoned
without
alfred
allingham
alfred
was
not
a
nice
boy
at
that
age
he
had
come
the
way
of
curled
darlings
to
be
a
sly
offensive
little
cad
and
the
next
saturday
when
pauline
turned
him
off
the
croquet
ground
for
ribaldry
he
went
as
far
as
the
rose
border
and
jeered
back
at
us
i
know
why
you
do
want
me
he
mocked
so
i
ca
see
olive
and
tommy
bettersworth
makin
eyes
he
executed
a
jig
to
the
tune
of
olive
mad
and
i
am
glad
and
i
know
what
please
her
at
this
juncture
the
wrist
and
hand
of
tommy
bettersworth
appeared
over
the
partition
fence
armed
with
which
thudded
with
precision
on
the
offensive
person
of
alfred
allingham
pauline
and
i
escaped
to
the
i
thought
i
was
going
to
cry
until
i
found
i
was
giggling
at
which
i
was
so
mortified
that
i
did
cry
he
tell
everybody
in
school
i
protested
what
do
you
care
soothed
pauline
besides
you
have
to
be
teased
about
somebody
you
know
and
have
somebody
to
choose
you
when
they
play
clap
in
and
clap
out
you
just
to
look
at
me
pauline
had
been
carrying
on
the
discreetest
of
flirtations
with
henry
glave
for
some
months
tommy
bettersworth
is
a
nice
boy
and
besides
dear
we
have
so
much
more
in
common
pauline
was
right
unless
you
had
somebody
to
be
teased
about
you
were
really
not
in
things
i
was
furiously
embarrassed
by
it
but
i
was
resigned
tommy
sent
me
two
notes
that
winter
and
a
silk
handkerchief
for
christmas
which
i
pretended
was
from
pauline
i
am
not
going
to
be
blamed
for
this
it
was
at
least
a
month
earlier
that
i
had
observed
tommy
bettersworth
inability
to
get
away
from
nile
corner
on
his
way
home
from
school
until
i
had
passed
there
on
mine
it
struck
me
as
a
very
interesting
trait
of
masculine
character
i
would
have
liked
to
talk
it
over
with
my
mother
on
the
plane
of
human
interest
it
seemed
possible
she
might
have
noted
similar
eccentricities
i
remember
i
worked
around
to
it
saturday
morning
when
i
was
helping
her
to
darn
the
tablecloths
my
mother
was
not
unprepared
she
did
her
duty
by
me
as
it
was
conceived
in
taylorville
and
did
it
promptly
you
are
too
young
to
be
thinking
about
the
boys
she
said
i
want
to
hear
you
talking
about
such
things
until
the
time
comes
this
was
so
much
in
line
with
what
was
expected
of
parents
that
i
blinked
the
obvious
retort
that
the
time
for
talking
about
such
things
was
when
they
began
to
happen
and
went
on
with
the
tablecloths
but
i
could
tell
her
about
the
handkerchief
after
that
it
would
have
been
positively
unmaidenly
and
after
he
had
sent
me
a
magnificent
paper
lace
valentine
i
distinctly
encouraged
tommy
bettersworth
this
being
the
case
i
do
not
know
just
how
it
began
to
be
conveyed
to
me
as
in
the
lengthening
evenings
of
spring
tommy
took
to
that
his
hands
were
coarse
and
his
ears
too
prominent
and
as
i
confided
solemnly
to
pauline
though
i
had
the
greatest
respect
for
his
character
i
simply
could
bear
to
have
him
about
this
was
the
more
singular
since
the
was
the
visible
sign
of
the
good
influence
that
according
to
the
books
i
was
exercising
and
though
tommy
was
as
nearly
inarticulate
as
was
natural
i
was
in
no
doubt
on
whose
account
this
new
start
proceeded
if
i
had
not
disliked
tommy
very
much
at
this
period
why
should
i
have
taken
to
tucking
myself
between
forester
and
effie
on
the
way
home
embarrassedly
aware
of
tommy
whose
way
did
not
lie
in
our
direction
scuffling
along
with
the
lawrences
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
i
seem
to
remember
some
rather
heroic
attempts
on
tommy
part
to
account
for
his
presence
there
on
the
ground
of
wanting
to
speak
privately
to
forester
certain
shouts
and
sallies
toward
which
my
brother
displayed
a
derisive
consciousness
of
their
not
being
pertinent
to
the
occasion
i
have
often
wondered
how
much
of
these
tentative
ventures
toward
an
altered
relation
were
observed
by
our
elders
not
much
i
should
think
at
any
rate
no
mollifying
word
drifted
down
from
their
heights
of
experience
to
our
shallows
of
my
mother
adhered
to
her
notion
of
my
not
being
at
an
age
for
such
things
borne
out
i
believe
by
the
consensus
of
paternal
opinion
that
she
might
too
easily
put
notions
in
my
head
not
inquiring
what
notions
might
by
the
natural
process
of
living
be
already
there
perhaps
they
were
not
altogether
wrong
in
this
so
delicate
is
the
process
of
sex
development
that
nature
herself
obscures
the
processes
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
how
much
my
taking
suddenly
to
going
home
with
belle
endsleigh
by
a
short
cut
was
embarrassment
and
how
much
a
discreet
feminine
awareness
that
in
my
absence
tommy
would
better
manage
to
make
the
family
take
his
walking
with
them
as
a
matter
of
course
but
i
remember
that
i
cried
when
my
mother
who
did
not
approve
of
belle
endsleigh
scolded
me
and
then
quite
suddenly
came
the
click
and
the
loosened
tension
of
the
readjustment
along
about
easter
alfred
allingham
told
pauline
that
tommy
had
thrashed
charlie
gower
and
though
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
strictest
secret
it
was
because
charlie
had
teased
him
about
me
pauline
was
rather
scandalized
by
my
insistence
that
charlie
would
have
done
it
if
tommy
had
rather
conspicuously
brought
it
on
himself
i
call
it
truly
noble
of
him
like
a
knight
pauline
could
always
throw
the
glamour
of
her
reading
around
the
immediate
circumstance
at
any
rate
after
this
you
ca
do
anything
less
than
treat
him
politely
she
urged
whether
it
would
have
made
any
difference
in
my
attitude
or
not
it
did
in
tommy
i
saw
that
when
he
came
out
of
the
church
with
us
next
sunday
there
was
a
certain
aggressive
maleness
in
the
way
he
strode
beside
me
that
there
was
no
mistaking
i
looked
about
rather
feebly
for
belle
i
do
see
her
anywhere
tommy
assured
me
besides
we
do
want
her
as
i
could
see
tommy
in
the
light
that
streamed
from
the
church
windows
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
he
was
not
he
certainly
looked
good
and
he
had
a
moustache
coming
forester
who
was
going
through
a
phase
himself
had
gone
home
with
amy
lawrence
effie
lagged
behind
with
mother
talking
to
endsleigh
about
the
prospects
of
the
sewing
society
raising
the
money
for
repainting
the
parsonage
looking
back
to
see
what
had
become
of
them
i
tripped
on
the
boardwalk
if
you
would
take
my
arm
suggested
tommy
i
was
aware
of
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
under
my
fingers
the
next
turn
took
us
out
of
sound
of
the
voices
the
street
lamps
flared
far
apart
in
the
long
quiet
avenue
the
shed
pods
of
the
maples
slipped
and
popped
under
us
with
the
sweet
smell
of
the
sap
how
did
you
like
the
sermon
tommy
wished
to
know
what
i
had
to
say
of
it
was
probably
not
very
much
to
the
point
no
one
overtook
us
as
we
walked
there
was
a
sense
of
tremendous
occasions
in
the
air
of
things
accomplished
i
had
established
the
privilege
i
was
walking
home
from
church
with
a
young
man
i
was
a
young
lady
chapter
vii
as
often
as
i
think
of
olivia
lattimore
growing
up
i
have
wondered
if
there
was
really
no
evidence
of
dramatic
talent
about
or
simply
no
one
able
to
observe
it
there
was
no
theatre
at
taylorville
and
when
from
time
to
time
stock
companies
performed
indifferent
plays
at
the
town
hall
forrie
and
effie
and
i
heard
nothing
of
them
except
that
they
were
presumably
wicked
occasionally
there
were
amateur
performances
in
which
when
i
had
won
a
grudging
consent
to
take
part
i
failed
to
distinguish
myself
effie
had
a
very
amusing
trick
of
mimicry
and
if
you
had
heard
her
recite
curfew
shall
not
ring
you
would
have
thought
that
the
gift
on
its
way
from
whatever
high
and
unknowable
source
in
passing
her
had
lighted
haphazard
on
the
most
unlikely
instrument
i
was
not
even
clever
at
my
books
except
by
starts
and
flashes
i
graduated
at
the
high
school
with
pauline
and
afterward
we
had
two
years
together
at
montecito
this
was
the
next
town
to
taylorville
and
its
bitter
rival
montecito
had
a
young
ladies
seminary
a
business
college
and
the
state
institution
for
the
blind
for
which
taylorville
so
little
forgave
it
that
the
new
railroad
was
persuaded
to
leave
montecito
four
miles
to
the
right
and
make
its
junction
with
the
and
at
taylorville
this
carried
the
farmer
shipping
away
from
montecito
but
the
victory
was
not
altogether
scathless
young
ladies
were
still
obliged
to
go
to
the
seminary
and
it
enabled
montecito
to
put
on
the
air
of
having
retired
from
the
vulgar
competition
of
trade
and
become
the
athens
of
the
west
pauline
and
i
went
over
to
school
on
mondays
and
home
on
fridays
the
course
of
study
was
for
three
years
but
because
there
was
effie
to
think
of
and
my
mother
means
were
limited
i
had
only
two
and
was
never
able
to
catch
up
with
pauline
by
the
length
of
that
extra
year
she
was
always
holding
it
out
against
me
in
extenuation
and
excuse
when
she
tried
to
account
for
my
marriage
having
turned
out
so
badly
on
the
ground
of
my
not
having
had
advantages
i
knew
she
was
thinking
of
montecito
she
thinks
of
it
still
i
imagine
to
condone
as
she
does
i
am
sure
with
an
adorable
womanliness
what
in
my
conduct
she
no
longer
feels
able
to
countenance
and
yet
i
hardly
know
what
i
might
have
drawn
from
that
third
year
more
than
i
took
away
from
the
other
two
which
was
besides
the
regular
course
of
study
an
acquaintance
with
a
style
of
furnishings
not
all
gilt
wall
paper
and
plush
brocade
and
a
renewed
taste
for
good
reading
they
made
such
a
point
of
good
reading
at
the
seminary
that
i
have
always
thought
it
a
pity
they
could
not
go
a
little
farther
and
make
a
practice
of
it
the
difficulty
with
most
of
our
reading
was
that
it
had
no
relativity
to
the
processes
of
life
in
ohianna
we
had
things
as
far
removed
from
it
as
dante
and
euripides
things
no
nearer
than
the
scarlet
letter
and
david
copperfield
from
which
to
draw
for
the
exigencies
of
taylorville
was
to
cause
my
mother
to
wonder
with
tears
in
her
eyes
why
in
the
world
i
could
be
like
other
people
i
read
i
gorged
in
fact
on
the
best
books
but
i
found
it
more
convenient
to
go
on
living
by
the
shallow
priggishness
of
cousin
judd
selection
all
that
splendid
stream
poured
in
upon
me
and
sank
and
lost
itself
in
the
shifty
undercurrent
that
made
still
by
times
distracting
eddies
on
the
surface
of
adolescence
but
whatever
was
missed
or
misunderstood
of
its
evidences
the
gift
worked
at
the
bottom
throve
like
a
sea
anemone
under
the
shallows
of
girlishness
and
nourished
by
unsuspected
means
was
the
source
no
doubt
of
the
live
resistance
i
opposed
to
all
that
grew
out
of
forester
making
a
vocation
of
being
a
good
son
i
do
not
know
yet
how
to
deal
with
sufficient
tenderness
and
without
exasperation
with
the
disposition
of
widowed
women
bred
to
dependence
to
build
out
of
their
sons
the
shape
of
a
man
proper
to
be
leaned
upon
it
is
so
justified
in
sentiment
so
pretty
to
see
in
its
immediate
phases
that
though
my
mother
was
young
and
attractive
enough
to
have
married
again
it
was
difficult
not
to
concur
in
her
making
a
virtue
a
glorification
of
living
entirely
in
her
boy
i
seem
to
remember
a
time
before
forrie
was
intrigued
by
the
general
appreciation
when
it
required
some
coercion
to
present
him
always
in
the
character
of
the
most
dutiful
son
he
had
for
instance
invariably
fancied
himself
setting
out
for
prayer
meeting
with
my
mother
hymn
book
and
umbrella
but
the
second
summer
after
my
father
died
when
he
had
worked
on
cousin
judd
farm
and
brought
home
his
wages
found
him
completely
implicated
we
were
really
not
so
poor
there
was
any
occasion
for
this
but
mother
was
so
delighted
with
the
idea
of
a
provider
and
forester
was
so
pleased
with
the
picture
of
himself
in
that
capacity
that
it
was
all
no
doubt
very
good
for
him
he
always
did
bring
home
his
wages
after
that
which
led
to
his
being
consulted
about
meals
and
the
new
curtains
for
the
and
to
being
met
in
the
evening
as
though
all
the
house
had
been
primed
for
his
return
and
merely
gone
on
in
that
expectation
while
he
was
away
effie
i
know
had
no
difficulty
in
accepting
him
as
the
excuse
for
any
amount
of
household
ritual
making
a
fuss
about
his
birthdays
and
trying
on
her
new
clothes
for
his
approval
but
effie
was
five
years
younger
than
forester
and
i
was
only
months
it
was
more
i
think
than
our
community
in
the
gaucheries
and
hesitancies
of
youth
that
disinclined
me
to
take
seriously
my
brother
opinions
on
window
curtains
and
to
sniff
at
my
mother
affectionate
pretence
of
his
being
the
head
of
the
family
at
times
when
i
felt
this
going
on
in
our
house
there
rose
up
like
a
wisp
of
fog
between
me
and
the
glittering
promise
of
the
future
a
kind
of
horror
of
the
destiny
of
women
to
defer
and
adjust
to
maintain
the
attitude
of
acquiescence
toward
opinions
and
capabilities
that
had
nothing
more
to
recommend
them
than
merely
that
they
were
a
man
i
could
be
abased
i
should
be
delighted
to
be
imposed
upon
but
if
i
paid
out
i
wanted
something
for
my
money
and
i
did
consider
i
was
getting
it
with
my
brother
for
whom
i
smuggled
notes
and
copied
compositions
it
never
occurred
to
my
mother
until
it
came
to
the
concrete
question
of
that
there
was
anything
more
than
a
kind
of
natural
perverseness
in
my
attitude
which
only
served
to
throw
into
relief
the
satisfactoriness
of
her
relations
to
her
son
forester
it
appeared
was
to
have
an
allowance
and
i
wanted
one
too
but
what
said
my
mother
tolerantly
for
she
had
not
yet
thought
of
granting
it
would
you
do
with
an
allowance
whatever
forester
does
but
forester
my
mother
explained
waving
the
stocking
she
had
stretched
upon
her
hand
is
a
boy
i
expostulated
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
olivia
the
ridiculousness
of
having
such
a
question
addressed
to
her
brought
a
smile
to
my
mother
lips
which
hung
fixed
there
as
i
saw
her
mind
back
away
suddenly
in
fear
that
i
was
really
going
to
insist
on
knowing
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
i
give
you
cents
a
week
for
church
money
she
parried
weakly
that
what
you
think
i
ought
to
give
i
want
an
allowance
and
then
i
can
deny
myself
and
give
what
i
like
forester
earns
his
said
my
mother
she
had
of
course
meant
the
discussion
to
get
on
to
a
basis
of
reasonableness
well
i
threatened
i
earn
mine
that
was
really
what
did
the
business
in
the
end
all
the
boys
in
taylorville
worked
as
soon
as
they
were
old
enough
but
it
was
the
last
resort
of
poverty
that
girls
should
be
put
to
wages
before
that
possibility
my
mother
retreated
into
amused
indulgence
she
paid
me
my
allowance
appreciably
less
than
my
brother
on
the
first
of
the
month
with
the
air
of
concurring
in
a
joke
which
i
think
now
must
have
covered
some
vague
hurt
at
my
want
of
sympathy
with
the
beautiful
fiction
of
forester
growing
up
to
take
my
father
place
with
her
they
had
achieved
by
the
time
forester
was
twenty
what
passed
for
perfect
confidence
between
them
though
it
was
at
the
cost
of
forester
living
shallowly
or
not
at
all
in
the
courts
of
boyhood
which
my
mother
was
unable
to
reënter
and
her
voluntary
withdrawal
from
varieties
of
experience
from
which
his
youth
prevented
him
my
mother
always
thought
it
was
made
up
to
her
in
affection
what
came
out
of
it
for
forester
is
still
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
i
began
to
say
how
it
was
that
the
gift
took
care
of
itself
while
forester
was
engrossing
the
family
attention
he
had
had
a
year
at
the
business
college
in
montecito
which
was
considered
quite
sufficient
and
rather
more
in
fact
than
his
accepted
vocation
as
the
support
of
his
mother
seemed
to
call
for
any
question
that
might
naturally
come
up
of
a
profession
for
him
seemed
to
have
been
quashed
beforehand
by
the
general
notion
of
an
immediate
salary
as
the
means
to
that
end
i
do
not
recall
a
voice
lifted
on
behalf
of
a
life
of
his
own
he
had
worked
up
from
driving
the
delivery
wagon
in
vacations
to
being
dry
goods
clerk
at
the
coöperative
where
his
affability
and
easy
familiarity
with
the
requirements
of
women
made
him
immensely
popular
everybody
liked
to
trade
with
forester
because
he
took
such
pains
in
matching
things
and
he
was
such
a
good
boy
to
his
mother
he
paid
the
largest
portion
of
his
salary
for
his
board
and
took
effie
who
adored
him
about
with
him
i
do
mean
to
say
that
he
was
not
also
good
friends
with
olivia
or
that
there
was
anything
which
prevented
my
doing
my
best
with
the
three
chocolate
layer
cakes
and
the
angel
food
i
made
for
his
party
on
his
birthday
the
real
unpleasantness
on
that
occasion
came
of
my
mother
notion
of
distinguishing
it
among
all
other
birthdays
by
paying
over
to
forester
a
third
of
the
not
very
considerable
sum
left
by
my
father
derived
chiefly
from
his
back
pay
as
an
officer
which
she
had
always
held
as
particularly
set
aside
for
us
children
it
was
owing
perhaps
to
a
form
of
secretiveness
that
in
unprotected
woman
does
duty
for
caution
that
effie
and
i
had
scarcely
heard
of
this
sum
until
it
was
flourished
before
us
on
the
day
before
the
birthday
much
as
if
it
had
been
my
father
sword
supposing
the
occasion
to
have
required
it
being
girded
on
his
son
forester
was
to
have
a
third
of
that
money
in
the
form
of
a
check
under
his
plate
on
the
morning
of
his
birthday
effie
and
i
did
full
justice
to
the
magnificence
of
the
proposal
i
was
beating
the
whites
of
thirteen
eggs
by
pauline
recipe
for
angel
food
mine
called
for
only
eleven
and
effie
was
rubbing
up
endsleigh
spoons
which
had
been
borrowed
for
the
party
i
was
always
happier
in
the
kitchen
than
in
any
room
of
the
house
with
its
plain
tinted
walls
the
plain
painted
woodwork
the
parlour
was
hideously
grained
and
the
red
of
effie
geraniums
at
the
window
ledge
the
stir
of
domesticity
all
this
talk
of
my
father
intrigued
me
for
the
moment
into
the
sense
of
being
a
valued
and
intrinsic
part
of
the
family
his
father
would
have
wanted
forester
to
have
that
money
said
my
mother
now
that
he
of
age
and
when
i
questioned
raised
by
the
mention
of
thirds
to
the
joyous
inclusion
are
effie
and
i
to
have
ours
oh
my
mother
interest
waned
when
you
are
married
perhaps
it
had
grown
in
my
mind
as
i
spoke
that
i
had
been
of
age
now
more
than
a
year
and
nothing
had
come
of
it
the
suggestion
that
my
father
could
have
taken
a
less
active
interest
in
the
event
on
my
behalf
pressed
upon
a
dying
sensibility
i
resented
his
being
so
committed
to
this
posthumous
slight
and
meant
to
defend
him
from
it
he
have
wanted
me
to
have
mine
on
my
birthday
the
same
as
forester
i
insisted
oh
olivia
my
mother
tone
intimated
annoyance
at
my
claim
to
being
supported
by
my
father
in
my
absurdities
but
her
good
humour
was
proof
against
it
girls
have
theirs
when
they
are
married
she
soothed
i
held
up
the
platter
and
whisked
the
stiff
froth
with
the
air
of
doing
these
things
very
dexterously
i
was
going
to
admit
by
taking
it
seriously
that
my
brother
coming
of
age
was
any
more
important
than
mine
but
i
spare
you
the
flippancies
by
which
i
covered
the
hurt
of
realizing
that
to
everybody
except
myself
it
was
it
is
so
like
you
olivia
said
my
mother
with
tears
in
her
eyes
to
want
to
spoil
everything
what
i
had
really
spoiled
was
the
free
exercise
of
partiality
by
which
she
was
enabled
to
distinguish
forester
over
her
other
children
according
to
her
sense
of
his
deserts
and
besides
what
in
the
world
would
the
child
do
with
all
that
money
the
same
thing
that
forester
does
i
maintained
and
then
quickly
to
forestall
another
objection
which
i
saw
rising
in
her
face
if
you
were
old
enough
to
be
married
at
nineteen
i
guess
i
am
old
enough
to
be
trusted
with
a
few
hundred
dollars
but
there
i
had
struck
again
on
the
structure
of
tradition
that
kept
taylorville
from
direct
contact
with
the
issues
of
life
anybody
was
old
enough
to
be
married
at
eighteen
but
money
was
a
serious
matter
whenever
i
said
things
like
that
i
could
see
my
mother
waver
between
a
shocked
wonder
at
having
produced
such
unnaturalness
and
the
fear
that
somebody
might
overhear
us
and
i
did
know
myself
what
i
wanted
with
that
money
except
that
i
craved
the
sense
of
being
important
that
went
with
the
possession
of
it
and
of
course
now
that
i
had
been
refused
it
on
the
ground
of
sex
it
was
part
of
the
general
resistance
that
i
opposed
to
things
as
they
were
to
have
it
on
principle
just
when
i
had
mother
almost
convinced
that
she
ought
to
give
it
to
me
she
made
it
nearly
impossible
for
me
to
accept
by
asking
forester
what
she
ought
to
do
about
it
when
i
had
demanded
it
as
the
evidence
of
my
taking
rank
with
my
brother
as
a
personage
it
was
insufferable
that
it
should
come
to
me
as
a
concession
of
his
amiability
what
i
really
wanted
of
course
was
to
have
it
put
under
my
plate
with
an
affectionate
speech
about
its
being
the
legacy
of
a
soldier
and
the
witness
of
his
integrity
coupled
with
the
hope
that
i
would
spend
it
in
a
manner
to
give
pleasure
to
my
dear
father
who
was
no
doubt
looking
on
at
this
happy
incident
there
was
nothing
in
me
then
there
is
nothing
now
which
advised
me
of
being
inappropriately
the
object
of
such
an
address
or
my
replying
to
it
as
gallantly
as
the
junior
clerk
of
the
coöperative
to
do
forester
justice
he
came
out
squarely
on
the
question
of
my
being
entitled
to
the
money
if
he
was
but
he
contrived
backhandedly
to
convey
his
sense
of
my
obtuseness
in
not
deferring
sentimentally
to
a
male
ascendancy
that
i
did
not
intrinsically
feel
and
i
can
go
back
now
to
these
disquieting
episodes
as
the
beginning
of
that
maladjustment
of
my
earlier
years
in
not
having
a
man
about
toward
whom
i
could
actually
experience
the
deference
i
was
expected
to
exhibit
well
i
had
my
check
for
the
same
amount
and
on
the
same
occasion
as
my
brother
but
the
feeling
in
the
air
of
its
being
merely
a
concession
to
my
forwardness
prevented
me
from
making
any
return
for
it
that
interfered
with
forester
carrying
off
the
situation
of
coming
into
his
father
legacy
on
coming
of
age
quite
to
my
mother
satisfaction
what
it
might
have
made
for
graciousness
for
once
in
my
life
to
have
been
the
centre
of
that
dramatic
affectionateness
i
can
only
guess
firm
in
the
determination
that
since
no
sentiment
went
to
its
bestowal
none
should
go
to
its
acknowledgment
i
carried
my
check
upstairs
and
shook
all
of
the
rugs
out
of
the
window
to
account
for
my
eyes
being
red
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
that
was
the
way
the
powers
took
to
provide
against
the
complete
submergence
of
the
actress
in
the
young
lady
for
though
it
turned
out
that
i
did
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
money
on
my
wedding
clothes
a
portion
of
it
went
for
the
only
technical
training
i
ever
had
the
real
business
of
a
young
lady
in
taylorville
was
getting
married
but
to
avoid
an
obviousness
in
the
interim
she
played
the
piano
or
painted
on
satin
or
became
interested
in
missions
if
my
money
had
fallen
in
eight
months
earlier
i
should
undoubtedly
have
spent
it
on
the
third
year
at
montecito
as
it
was
i
decided
to
study
elocution
it
appeared
a
wholly
fortuitous
choice
i
was
not
supposed
to
have
any
talent
for
it
but
i
burned
to
spend
some
of
my
money
sensibly
and
it
was
admittedly
sensible
for
a
young
lady
to
take
lessons
in
something
effie
was
having
music
flora
haines
painted
plaques
when
olivia
joined
professor
winter
elocution
classes
at
temperance
hall
mother
said
it
looked
like
throwing
money
away
but
of
course
i
could
teach
in
case
anything
happened
which
meant
in
case
of
my
not
being
married
or
being
left
a
widow
with
young
children
professor
winter
was
the
kind
of
man
who
would
have
collected
patch
boxes
and
painted
miniatures
on
ladies
fans
not
that
he
could
have
done
anything
of
the
sort
on
his
income
but
it
would
have
suited
the
kind
of
man
he
was
he
had
small
neat
ways
and
nice
little
tricks
of
discrimination
and
microscopic
enthusiasms
that
hovered
and
fluttered
enough
of
them
when
it
came
to
the
rendering
of
a
favourite
passage
to
produce
a
kind
of
haze
of
appreciation
like
a
swarm
of
midges
not
being
able
to
afford
patch
boxes
or
louis
xv
enamels
he
collected
accents
instead
the
man
memory
for
phonic
variations
was
extraordinary
all
our
accustomed
speech
was
a
wild
garden
over
which
he
took
little
flights
and
drops
and
humming
poises
extracting
as
it
were
by
sips
your
private
history
things
you
would
have
probably
told
for
the
asking
but
objected
to
having
wrested
from
your
betraying
tongue
he
would
come
teetering
forward
on
his
neat
little
boots
upon
the
toes
of
which
he
appeared
to
elevate
himself
by
pressing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
very
firmly
together
and
when
you
committed
yourself
no
farther
than
to
remark
on
the
state
of
the
weather
or
the
election
outlook
he
would
want
to
know
if
you
had
spent
some
time
of
your
youth
in
the
south
or
if
it
was
your
maternal
or
paternal
grandfather
who
was
norwegian
either
of
which
would
be
true
and
annoying
particularly
as
you
were
aware
of
speaking
other
than
the
rest
of
the
world
for
if
there
was
anything
quite
and
completely
abhorrent
to
the
taylorville
mind
it
was
the
implication
of
being
different
from
other
taylorvillians
somewhere
the
professor
had
picked
up
an
adequate
theory
and
practice
of
voice
production
though
i
never
knew
anything
of
his
training
except
that
he
had
been
an
instructor
in
a
normal
school
and
was
aggrieved
at
his
dismissal
after
he
had
advertised
himself
as
open
for
private
instruction
and
classes
at
temperance
hall
there
was
something
almost
like
a
concerted
effort
at
keeping
him
in
the
town
because
of
the
credit
he
afforded
us
against
montecito
with
the
exception
of
a
personage
who
came
over
from
the
business
college
in
the
winter
to
conduct
evening
classes
in
penmanship
he
was
the
only
man
addressed
habitually
as
professor
and
the
only
one
who
wore
evening
dress
at
public
functions
his
dress
coat
imparted
a
particular
touch
of
elegance
to
occasions
when
he
gave
readings
from
evangeline
and
the
lady
of
the
lake
taylorville
choice
and
thoroughly
discredited
a
disgruntled
montecitan
who
on
the
basis
of
having
been
to
chicago
on
his
wedding
trip
insisted
that
such
were
only
worn
by
waiters
in
hotels
it
would
be
interesting
to
record
that
professor
winter
lent
himself
with
alacrity
to
the
unfolding
of
my
gift
but
in
fact
his
imagination
hardly
strayed
so
far
he
taught
phonics
and
voice
production
and
taught
them
very
well
probably
he
had
no
more
practical
acquaintance
with
the
stage
than
i
had
certainly
he
never
suggested
it
for
me
and
for
my
part
i
could
hardly
have
explained
why
with
so
little
encouragement
i
was
so
devoted
to
the
rather
tedious
drill
pauline
was
still
at
the
seminary
and
the
regular
hours
of
practice
made
a
bulwark
against
an
insidious
proprietary
air
which
tommy
bettersworth
began
to
wear
besides
the
voice
training
i
had
a
system
of
physical
culture
artificial
and
unsound
as
i
have
since
learned
but
serving
to
restrain
my
too
exuberant
gesture
and
much
memorizing
of
poems
and
plays
for
practice
work
i
hardly
know
if
the
professor
had
any
dramatic
talent
or
not
probably
not
as
he
made
nothing
i
remember
of
stopping
me
in
the
middle
of
a
great
passion
for
the
sake
of
a
dropped
consonant
and
deprecated
original
readings
on
my
part
it
was
his
relish
for
musical
cadence
as
much
as
its
intellectual
appreciation
that
led
him
to
select
the
elizabethan
drama
in
the
great
scenes
of
which
i
was
letter
perfect
by
the
time
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
professor
instruction
and
at
the
end
too
it
seemed
of
my
devices
for
dodging
the
destiny
of
women
chapter
viii
i
have
tried
to
sketch
to
you
how
in
taylorville
we
were
allowed
to
stumble
on
the
consciousness
of
sex
but
i
can
give
you
no
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
we
were
prevented
from
the
judgment
somewhere
between
the
ages
of
sixteen
and
eighteen
one
was
loosed
on
a
free
and
lively
social
intercourse
from
which
one
was
expected
to
emerge
later
triumphantly
mated
this
was
obligatory
otherwise
your
family
sighed
and
said
that
somehow
olivia
did
seem
to
know
how
to
catch
a
husband
and
then
painstakingly
refrained
from
the
subject
in
your
presence
or
your
mother
if
she
was
particularly
loyal
said
she
had
always
thought
there
was
no
call
for
a
girl
to
marry
if
she
did
feel
to
want
to
but
anything
resembling
maternal
interference
in
your
behalf
was
looked
upon
as
worldly
minded
or
at
the
least
unnecessary
the
custom
of
chaperonage
was
unheard
of
girls
were
supposed
to
be
trusted
i
do
not
recall
now
that
i
ever
had
any
particular
instruction
as
to
how
to
conduct
myself
toward
young
men
except
that
they
were
never
on
any
account
to
take
liberties
whatever
else
went
to
the
difficult
business
of
mating
you
were
supposed
to
pick
up
that
i
did
not
pass
through
this
period
in
entire
obliviousness
was
due
to
pauline
who
had
the
keenest
appreciation
of
her
effect
on
the
opposite
sex
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
is
described
as
having
always
had
a
great
deal
of
attention
she
had
a
nice
procrustean
notion
of
the
sort
of
young
man
to
be
engaged
to
our
maiden
imagination
hardly
went
farther
than
that
and
her
young
ladyhood
appeared
to
be
a
process
of
trying
it
on
the
greatest
possible
number
of
eligible
taylorvillians
when
she
came
home
from
montecito
she
had
already
met
henry
mills
at
the
house
of
a
roommate
where
she
had
spent
the
easter
vacation
and
he
had
sent
her
flowers
at
commencement
and
verses
of
his
own
composition
it
was
pauline
who
explained
to
me
that
unless
i
had
some
young
man
like
tommy
bettersworth
who
could
be
counted
on
i
could
hardly
hope
to
be
in
things
when
they
made
up
a
party
to
go
sleighing
for
instance
or
a
picnic
to
willesden
lake
i
liked
being
in
things
and
did
not
altogether
dislike
tommy
bettersworth
he
was
a
thoroughly
creditable
beau
and
required
very
little
handling
for
even
as
early
as
that
i
had
an
inkling
of
what
i
have
long
since
concluded
that
a
man
who
requires
overmuch
to
be
played
and
baited
held
off
and
on
is
rather
poor
game
after
you
have
got
him
it
worried
pauline
not
a
little
that
i
forgave
tommy
so
lightly
for
small
offences
she
was
afraid
it
might
appear
that
i
liked
him
too
much
when
in
truth
it
was
only
that
i
liked
him
too
little
and
for
complacence
if
i
had
had
any
disposition
toward
it
i
was
saved
by
the
shocking
example
of
forester
all
of
whose
relations
were
tinged
by
his
vocation
of
model
son
he
had
acquired
by
this
time
a
manner
by
the
intimacy
greater
than
is
common
in
boys
with
which
he
lived
into
the
feminine
life
of
the
household
and
by
his
daily
performance
of
measuring
off
petticoats
and
matching
hose
which
admitted
him
to
families
where
we
visited
on
a
footing
that
enabled
him
to
flirt
with
the
daughters
under
the
very
of
their
mothers
you
could
somehow
maintain
a
strict
virginal
severity
with
a
young
man
who
had
just
taken
an
informed
and
personal
interest
in
your
mother
flannelette
wrappers
the
credit
of
whose
dutifulness
was
a
warrant
for
his
not
meaning
anything
in
particular
in
short
forrie
spooned
i
think
now
there
was
some
excuse
for
him
he
had
been
wrenched
very
early
by
his
affections
from
the
normal
outbreaks
of
adolescence
he
had
never
to
my
knowledge
been
out
with
the
boys
unless
he
got
it
in
the
business
of
junior
clerk
at
the
coöperative
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
a
male
life
at
all
he
was
being
shaped
to
a
man
performance
at
the
expense
of
his
mannishness
but
against
his
philandering
rose
up
not
only
the
fastidiousness
of
girlhood
but
some
latent
sense
of
rightness
as
keen
in
me
as
the
violinist
for
the
variation
of
tone
something
that
questioned
the
justice
of
pronouncing
thoroughly
moral
a
young
man
who
if
he
never
went
over
the
brink
was
willing
to
spend
a
considerable
portion
of
his
time
on
the
edge
of
it
i
should
have
admired
forester
more
at
this
juncture
if
he
had
been
a
little
wild
and
i
knew
perfectly
that
my
mother
would
have
interdicted
any
social
life
for
me
whatever
if
i
had
permitted
a
tithe
of
the
familiarities
allowed
to
my
brother
among
the
other
things
which
a
girl
was
expected
to
pick
up
along
with
the
art
of
attracting
a
husband
was
the
vital
information
with
which
she
was
expected
to
meet
the
occasion
of
marrying
one
it
was
all
a
part
of
the
general
assumption
of
the
truth
as
something
not
suitable
for
the
young
to
know
that
nobody
told
us
any
of
these
things
if
they
could
help
it
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
certain
amount
of
half
information
whispered
about
among
the
girls
who
by
the
avidity
for
such
whisperings
established
themselves
as
not
quite
nice
but
pauline
allingham
and
i
were
nice
girls
what
this
meant
was
that
nothing
that
pertained
to
the
mystery
of
marriage
reached
us
through
all
the
suppression
and
evasions
of
the
social
conspiracy
except
the
obviousness
of
maternity
i
remember
how
intimations
of
it
as
part
of
our
legitimate
experience
began
to
grow
upon
us
with
a
profound
and
tender
curiosity
toward
very
young
children
and
particularly
on
pauline
part
a
great
shyness
of
being
seen
in
their
company
but
we
were
not
expected
to
possess
ourselves
of
accurate
information
until
we
were
already
involved
in
it
we
had
reached
the
age
when
matrons
no
longer
avoided
references
to
its
most
conspicuous
phases
in
our
presence
before
we
found
words
for
mentioning
it
to
one
another
there
was
a
young
aunt
of
pauline
lent
something
to
that
she
was
a
sister
of
allingham
come
to
stay
with
them
while
her
husband
was
absent
somewhere
in
the
west
pauline
told
me
about
it
one
of
the
she
spent
at
home
from
montecito
this
was
saturday
afternoon
and
she
had
found
the
aunt
in
the
house
on
her
return
the
evening
before
do
you
know
she
said
it
is
very
queer
the
way
i
feel
about
aunt
alice
the
way
she
is
you
know
mamma
had
told
me
and
when
i
came
into
the
sitting
room
and
saw
her
i
thought
i
was
going
to
cry
and
it
was
that
i
was
sorry
either
i
awfully
fond
of
her
i
just
felt
it
yes
i
know
i
admitted
aunt
alice
is
so
sensible
pauline
explained
a
few
weeks
later
she
talks
to
me
a
great
deal
she
only
a
few
years
older
than
i
am
she
has
shown
me
all
her
things
for
the
baby
mamma
did
think
she
ought
you
know
how
mothers
are
they
in
the
bureau
drawer
in
the
best
room
i
show
them
to
you
some
time
alice
wo
mind
alice
did
mind
it
appeared
so
it
must
have
been
shyness
that
led
us
to
select
the
afternoon
when
the
married
women
were
away
and
though
i
can
not
forgive
the
conditions
which
led
us
so
surreptitiously
to
touch
the
fringe
of
the
great
experience
i
own
still
to
some
tenderness
for
the
two
girls
with
their
heads
together
that
bright
hot
afternoon
over
the
bureau
drawer
in
allingham
best
room
pauline
showed
me
a
little
sacque
which
she
had
crocheted
mother
thought
i
was
too
young
but
alice
said
i
might
you
must
have
liked
to
awfully
i
envied
that
one
of
the
nice
things
about
having
children
i
should
think
pauline
fingered
a
hemstitched
slip
you
can
make
things
for
them
which
would
you
rather
have
girls
or
boys
i
hazarded
oh
girls
you
can
always
dress
them
so
prettily
but
boys
they
can
do
so
many
things
when
they
grow
up
i
felt
rather
strongly
on
that
point
alice
says
pauline
folded
the
little
frock
that
she
so
glad
to
have
it
she
does
care
which
it
is
something
perhaps
an
echo
of
my
mother
experience
pricked
in
me
they
are
always
as
glad
as
that
i
suppose
not
alice
is
having
this
one
because
she
wants
it
we
looked
at
one
another
we
would
have
liked
to
have
spoken
further
to
have
defined
ourselves
despoiled
ourselves
of
tenderness
nobilities
but
around
the
whole
subject
lay
the
blank
expanse
of
our
ignorance
we
locked
the
drawer
again
and
went
out
and
played
croquet
and
that
was
how
we
stood
toward
our
normal
destiny
that
summer
when
pauline
was
wondering
if
henry
mills
meant
to
propose
to
her
and
i
was
wondering
how
much
longer
i
could
keep
tommy
bettersworth
from
proposing
to
me
i
managed
to
stave
it
off
until
the
end
of
september
on
the
of
that
month
there
was
a
picnic
at
willesden
lake
there
were
ten
couples
of
us
and
flora
haines
who
was
wanted
to
count
even
with
a
young
man
who
was
to
join
us
at
the
lake
a
stranger
to
most
of
us
nephew
to
one
of
the
wealthiest
farmers
in
the
township
we
had
always
wished
there
might
have
been
young
people
at
the
garrett
farm
and
there
was
some
talk
of
this
nephew
who
was
to
come
on
a
visit
being
adopted
some
of
our
brothers
had
made
his
acquaintance
and
pauline
who
had
met
him
at
montecito
had
warranted
him
as
interesting
i
believe
flora
haines
was
invited
to
pair
with
him
because
every
girl
felt
that
flora
would
be
eminently
safe
to
trust
her
own
young
man
to
in
the
event
of
helmeth
garrett
proving
more
worth
while
henry
mills
who
was
reading
law
at
the
county
seat
of
the
adjoining
county
had
come
over
for
the
picnic
and
was
expected
to
bring
matters
to
a
crisis
with
pauline
and
forester
had
a
day
off
to
take
belle
endsleigh
who
was
at
the
point
of
pitying
him
because
though
he
had
such
an
affectionate
disposition
so
long
as
his
mother
depended
on
him
he
could
think
of
marrying
we
had
no
chaperone
of
course
several
of
the
couples
were
engaged
and
there
were
brothers
we
would
have
to
put
up
with
the
implication
that
we
were
not
able
to
manage
by
ourselves
it
was
the
sort
of
day
soft
indian
summer
painted
woodlands
gossamer
glinting
high
in
the
windless
air
on
which
forester
found
it
necessary
to
hope
brotherly
that
i
should
be
able
to
get
through
it
without
being
silly
by
that
he
meant
that
the
submerged
olivia
however
interestingly
she
might
read
in
a
book
was
highly
incomprehensible
and
nearly
always
ridiculous
to
her
contemporaries
willesden
lake
was
properly
a
drainage
pond
of
four
or
five
acres
in
extent
drawn
like
a
bow
about
the
contour
of
two
hills
grew
at
the
head
where
a
stream
came
in
and
muskrats
built
at
the
lower
end
the
picnic
ground
was
in
the
hollow
between
the
two
hills
by
a
spring
where
the
grass
grew
smooth
like
a
lawn
to
the
roots
of
oaks
burning
blood
red
from
leaf
to
leaf
as
it
turned
out
though
we
put
off
lunch
for
him
for
an
hour
young
garrett
did
not
come
and
as
the
party
sat
about
on
the
mossy
hummocks
in
the
quiet
of
repletion
i
thought
nothing
could
be
so
much
worth
while
as
to
leave
tommy
in
care
of
flora
haines
and
get
away
into
the
woods
by
myself
the
soul
of
the
weather
had
got
into
my
soul
and
i
felt
i
should
discredit
myself
with
forester
if
i
stayed
there
was
a
little
footpath
that
led
down
by
a
rill
to
the
lake
and
as
i
took
it
there
was
scarcely
a
sound
louder
than
the
soft
of
the
painted
leaves
there
were
two
or
three
old
boats
half
tied
at
the
head
of
the
lake
and
one
of
these
i
found
and
paddled
across
to
the
opposite
bank
i
had
not
known
there
was
a
path
there
opening
from
the
dewberry
bushes
that
dipped
along
the
border
but
the
spirit
in
my
feet
answered
to
its
invitation
i
followed
it
up
the
hill
through
the
leaf
drift
that
heaped
whispering
in
the
smoky
wood
i
spread
out
my
arms
as
i
went
and
began
to
move
to
the
rhythm
of
chanted
verse
where
the
red
and
gold
and
russet
banners
brushed
me
i
was
touched
delicately
as
with
flame
i
had
on
a
very
pretty
dress
that
day
i
remember
a
thin
organdy
with
a
leaf
pattern
made
up
over
yellow
sateen
and
the
consciousness
of
suitability
worked
happily
on
my
mind
at
the
top
of
the
hill
i
struck
into
an
old
wood
road
where
it
passed
through
a
grove
of
young
hickory
blazing
yellow
like
a
host
here
i
went
slowly
and
dropped
the
chanting
to
the
measure
of
classic
english
verse
it
was
the
only
means
of
expression
taylorville
had
provided
me
scene
after
scene
i
went
through
happy
and
oblivious
i
had
been
at
it
half
an
hour
perhaps
moving
forward
with
the
natural
impetus
of
the
play
in
the
faint
old
wagon
tracks
and
had
got
as
far
as
flowers
that
affrighted
she
let
fall
from
dis
wagon
when
i
was
startled
by
the
clapping
of
hands
and
looked
up
to
see
a
young
man
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
rail
fence
that
ran
straight
across
the
way
as
though
he
might
have
stopped
there
to
rest
in
the
act
of
climbing
over
i
knew
you
would
see
me
the
next
minute
he
said
and
i
wanted
to
be
discovered
in
the
act
of
appreciation
he
sprang
down
from
the
fence
and
came
toward
me
taking
off
his
hat
i
suppose
you
are
from
the
picnic
i
expected
to
find
you
somewhere
about
i
am
helmeth
garrett
they
at
the
spring
we
waited
lunch
for
you
i
am
miss
lattimore
olivia
may
i
supplemented
i
was
a
little
doubtful
about
that
point
for
at
taylorville
we
called
one
another
by
our
first
names
i
was
pleased
with
the
swiftness
with
which
he
struck
upon
a
permissible
compromise
i
owe
you
all
sorts
of
apologies
miss
olivia
but
the
mare
i
was
to
ride
went
lame
and
uncle
could
spare
me
another
so
i
had
an
early
lunch
at
the
house
and
walked
over
as
he
stood
looking
down
at
me
i
saw
that
he
had
a
crop
of
unruly
dark
hair
and
what
there
was
in
his
face
that
pauline
had
found
interesting
he
wore
a
soft
red
tie
knotted
loosely
at
the
collar
of
a
white
flannel
shirt
and
for
the
rest
of
him
was
dressed
very
much
as
other
young
men
all
at
once
a
spark
of
irrepressible
friendliness
flashed
up
in
smiles
between
us
it
seemed
the
merest
chance
then
that
i
had
come
across
the
wood
to
meet
him
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened
since
i
see
that
the
guardian
of
my
submerged
self
was
doing
what
it
could
for
me
but
against
the
embattled
social
forces
of
taylorville
what
could
even
the
gods
do
if
you
will
take
me
to
the
others
he
suggested
i
can
make
my
excuses
and
then
we
can
talk
it
was
remarkable
i
thought
that
he
should
have
discovered
so
early
that
we
would
wish
to
talk
we
began
to
move
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
were
you
doing
a
play
he
asked
i
nodded
how
long
were
you
watching
me
since
you
passed
the
plum
brush
yonder
it
was
bully
are
you
going
on
the
stage
i
explained
about
professor
winter
and
the
elocution
lessons
they
do
approve
of
the
stage
in
taylorville
i
finished
touched
by
the
vanishing
trace
of
a
realization
that
up
to
this
moment
the
objection
would
have
been
stated
personally
and
with
all
your
talent
oh
i
know
what
i
saying
i
lived
in
chicago
four
years
and
saw
a
lot
of
the
theatre
he
began
to
talk
to
me
of
the
stage
probably
much
of
it
neither
informed
nor
profitable
but
i
had
never
heard
it
talked
of
before
in
unembarrassed
relevancy
to
living
and
he
had
that
trick
of
speech
that
goes
with
the
achieving
propensity
of
accelerating
his
own
energy
as
he
talked
so
that
its
backwater
fairly
floated
us
into
the
ease
of
intimacy
there
was
no
doubt
we
were
tremendously
pleased
with
one
another
i
was
throbbing
still
with
the
measure
of
verse
and
moved
half
trippingly
to
the
rhythm
of
my
blood
do
you
dance
too
what
went
with
that
implied
something
personal
and
complimentary
oh
no
a
few
steps
i
picked
up
at
school
that
another
of
the
things
we
do
approve
at
taylorville
i
say
what
a
lot
of
old
mossbacks
there
must
be
about
here
anyway
take
my
uncle
now
he
went
on
to
tell
me
how
he
had
tried
to
induce
his
uncle
who
could
afford
it
to
advance
the
money
for
technical
training
in
engineering
uncle
garrett
was
of
the
opinion
that
helmeth
would
do
better
to
get
a
job
with
some
good
man
and
pick
up
things
always
managed
to
get
along
by
rule
of
thumb
himself
said
the
nephew
and
thinks
all
the
rest
of
us
ought
to
i
said
would
it
be
with
a
doctor
now
just
to
scramble
up
his
medicine
but
you
ca
get
through
to
my
uncle
he
thinks
a
man
who
can
run
a
thrashing
machine
is
an
engineer
i
remember
that
we
found
it
necessary
to
sit
down
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
toward
the
pond
while
he
sketched
for
me
his
notion
of
what
an
engineer
career
might
be
but
you
got
to
have
technical
training
got
to
talk
about
rule
of
thumb
it
like
going
at
it
with
no
thumbs
at
all
in
the
midst
of
this
we
remembered
that
we
ought
to
be
looking
for
the
rest
of
the
picnickers
once
in
the
boat
however
there
was
a
muskrat
nest
which
as
something
new
to
him
had
to
be
poked
into
and
we
stopped
to
gather
lilies
which
i
could
not
have
done
by
myself
without
wetting
my
dress
when
we
came
at
last
to
the
spring
we
found
the
lunch
baskets
huddled
under
the
oak
and
nobody
about
i
think
we
must
have
been
very
far
gone
by
this
time
in
the
young
rapture
of
intimacy
the
wood
was
smokily
still
and
we
scuffed
great
heaps
of
the
leaves
together
as
we
walked
about
pretending
to
look
for
the
others
i
remember
it
seemed
a
singular
circumstance
that
the
leaves
flew
up
from
under
our
feet
and
fell
lightly
on
our
faces
and
our
hair
i
suppose
we
ca
help
finding
them
the
wonder
is
they
have
been
spoiling
our
good
talk
before
now
oh
i
protested
if
you
had
been
coming
to
look
for
them
you
would
have
met
me
and
now
that
we
have
met
we
are
going
to
keep
on
i
coming
to
see
you
may
i
if
you
care
so
much
a
little
spiral
of
wind
rising
out
of
the
breathlessness
whirled
up
a
smother
of
brightening
leaves
it
caught
my
skirts
and
whipped
them
against
his
knees
it
seemed
to
have
blown
our
hands
together
too
though
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
how
that
was
care
he
said
if
i
care
oh
you
beauty
you
wonder
all
at
once
he
had
kissed
me
the
electrical
moment
hung
in
the
air
poised
took
flight
upward
in
dizzying
splendour
suddenly
from
within
the
wood
came
a
little
snigger
of
laughter
chapter
ix
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
took
for
the
certainty
that
i
had
been
kissed
by
an
utter
stranger
in
the
presence
of
the
entire
picnic
to
work
through
the
singing
flames
in
which
that
kiss
had
wrapped
me
we
must
have
walked
on
almost
immediately
in
the
direction
of
the
snigger
i
remember
a
kind
of
clutch
of
my
spirit
toward
the
mere
mechanical
act
of
walking
to
hold
me
fast
to
the
time
and
place
from
which
there
was
an
inward
rush
to
escape
we
walked
on
they
were
all
sitting
together
under
a
bank
of
hazel
and
the
girls
laps
were
filled
with
the
brown
clusters
out
of
my
whirling
dimness
i
heard
helmeth
garrett
explaining
as
i
introduced
him
how
he
had
come
across
me
in
the
wood
looking
for
them
and
of
course
suggested
charlie
gower
in
such
good
company
you
were
in
a
hurry
about
looking
for
the
rest
of
us
i
remembered
the
asparagus
bed
and
was
glad
i
had
slapped
him
no
my
companion
looked
him
over
very
coolly
now
that
i
seen
some
of
the
rest
of
you
i
glad
i
did
hurry
plainly
it
was
going
to
do
to
try
to
take
it
out
of
helmeth
garrett
as
we
began
by
common
consent
to
move
back
to
the
spring
forester
drew
me
by
the
arm
behind
the
hazel
he
was
divided
between
a
brotherly
disgust
at
my
lapse
and
delight
to
have
caught
the
prim
olivia
tripping
well
he
exclaimed
you
done
it
considering
what
i
knew
of
forester
affairs
this
was
unbearable
oh
it
is
for
to
talk
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
i
am
to
thrash
him
or
not
thrash
him
i
wondered
for
getting
you
talked
about
off
there
in
the
woods
all
afternoon
we
were
i
began
but
suddenly
i
saw
the
white
bolls
of
the
sycamores
redden
with
the
westering
sun
we
must
have
been
three
hours
covering
what
was
at
most
a
half
hour
walk
do
be
vulgar
forester
i
went
on
with
my
chin
in
the
air
oh
well
was
my
brother
parting
shot
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
make
any
objection
seeing
you
did
that
i
felt
was
the
weakness
of
my
position
i
not
only
had
made
any
objection
i
had
felt
any
shame
the
annoyance
the
hurt
of
outraged
maidenliness
whatever
was
the
traditional
attitude
come
inwardly
i
burned
with
the
woods
afire
the
red
west
the
white
star
like
a
torch
that
came
out
above
it
on
the
way
home
helmeth
garrett
rode
with
us
as
far
as
the
main
road
and
was
particularly
attentive
to
pauline
and
flora
haines
i
remember
it
came
to
me
dimly
that
there
was
something
designedly
protective
in
this
there
was
more
or
less
veiled
innuendo
flying
about
which
failed
to
get
through
to
me
pauline
put
it
quite
plainly
for
me
when
she
came
to
talk
things
over
the
day
after
the
picnic
she
was
sympathetic
oh
my
dear
it
must
be
dreadful
for
you
she
cooed
a
perfect
stranger
and
getting
you
talked
about
that
way
so
i
am
talked
about
my
what
could
you
expect
and
in
plain
sight
of
us
if
you
had
only
pushed
him
away
or
something
i
could
i
said
i
was
so
astonished
in
the
night
i
had
found
myself
explaining
to
pauline
how
this
affair
of
helmeth
garrett
had
differed
importantly
from
all
similar
instances
now
i
saw
its
shining
surfaces
dimmed
with
comment
like
unwiped
glass
that
just
what
i
pauline
was
pleased
with
herself
i
told
belle
endsleigh
you
were
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
you
were
overcome
but
of
course
he
was
really
a
gentleman
or
he
would
have
done
it
i
do
not
know
why
at
this
moment
it
occurred
to
me
that
probably
henry
mills
had
proposed
to
pauline
after
all
but
before
i
could
frame
a
discreet
question
she
was
off
in
another
direction
what
will
tommy
bettersworth
say
why
what
has
he
got
to
do
with
it
after
the
way
you
encouraged
him
you
mean
because
i
went
to
the
picnic
with
him
well
what
can
he
do
about
it
pauline
gave
me
up
with
a
gesture
tommy
is
the
soul
of
chivalry
she
said
and
anybody
can
see
he
is
crazy
about
you
simply
crazy
what
i
really
wanted
was
that
she
should
go
on
talking
about
helmeth
garrett
i
wanted
ground
for
putting
to
her
that
since
all
we
had
been
sedulously
taught
about
kissing
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
that
it
was
horrid
cheapening
insufferable
had
failed
to
establish
itself
had
in
fact
come
as
a
sword
divining
mystery
it
could
be
dealt
with
on
the
accepted
taylorville
basis
i
felt
the
quality
of
achievement
in
helmeth
garrett
right
to
kiss
me
a
right
which
i
was
sure
he
lacked
only
the
occasion
to
establish
but
when
the
occasion
came
it
went
all
awry
it
was
the
next
sunday
morning
and
all
down
polk
street
the
flower
borders
were
a
little
made
up
for
by
the
passage
between
the
shoals
of
maple
leaves
that
lined
the
walks
of
whole
flocks
of
bright
winged
new
fall
hats
on
their
way
to
church
mother
and
effie
were
in
front
and
two
of
my
scholars
had
scurried
up
like
rabbits
out
of
the
fallen
leafage
and
tucked
themselves
on
either
side
of
my
carefully
held
skirts
suddenly
there
was
a
rattle
of
buggy
wheels
on
the
winter
roughed
road
it
turned
in
by
niles
corner
and
drove
directly
toward
us
the
top
was
down
and
i
made
out
by
the
quick
pricking
of
my
blood
the
garrett
bays
and
helmeth
with
his
hat
off
his
hair
tousled
and
a
bright
soft
tie
swinging
free
of
his
vest
you
saw
heads
turning
all
along
the
block
in
discreet
censure
of
his
unsabbatical
behaviour
he
recognized
me
almost
immediately
and
turned
the
team
with
intention
to
our
side
of
the
street
he
was
going
to
speak
to
me
he
was
speaking
my
mother
back
stiffened
she
did
know
of
course
forrie
would
have
had
the
face
to
tell
her
but
how
many
eyes
on
us
up
and
down
the
street
did
know
a
teacher
in
the
midst
of
her
scholars
and
he
had
kissed
me
on
thursday
olivia
said
my
mother
do
you
know
that
young
man
such
manners
sunday
morning
too
well
i
am
glad
that
you
had
the
sense
to
ignore
him
and
i
did
not
know
until
that
moment
that
i
had
it
was
because
of
my
habit
of
living
inwardly
i
suppose
that
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
the
incident
could
have
any
other
bearing
on
our
relations
than
the
secret
one
of
confirming
me
in
my
impression
of
our
intimacy
being
on
a
superior
excluding
footing
he
had
come
as
i
was
perfectly
aware
to
renew
it
at
the
point
of
breaking
off
and
this
security
quite
blinded
me
to
the
effect
my
cold
reception
might
have
upon
him
that
he
would
fail
to
understand
how
i
was
hemmed
and
pinned
in
by
taylorville
had
occurred
to
me
not
even
when
he
passed
us
again
on
the
way
home
from
church
driving
recklessly
his
hat
was
on
this
time
determinedly
to
one
side
and
he
was
smoking
smoking
a
cigar
i
thought
at
first
he
had
not
seen
me
but
he
turned
suddenly
when
he
was
quite
past
and
swept
me
a
flourish
with
it
held
between
two
fingers
of
the
hand
that
touched
his
hat
at
that
time
in
taylorville
no
really
nice
young
man
smoked
at
least
not
when
he
would
get
found
out
this
offensiveness
in
the
face
of
the
returning
was
too
flagrant
to
admit
even
the
appearance
of
noticing
it
but
that
it
would
be
noticed
taken
stock
of
in
the
general
summing
up
of
our
relation
i
was
sickeningly
aware
tommy
bettersworth
put
one
version
of
it
for
me
comfortingly
when
he
came
in
the
evening
to
take
me
to
church
i
saw
you
turn
down
that
garrett
fellow
this
morning
served
him
right
that
and
the
way
you
behaved
thursday
just
as
if
you
did
not
find
him
worth
rowing
about
a
lot
of
girls
make
a
fuss
and
only
to
draw
a
fellow
on
and
now
you
going
to
church
with
me
the
same
as
usual
that
show
what
think
of
it
now
i
had
clean
forgotten
that
tommy
might
come
that
evening
i
was
whelmed
with
the
certainty
that
helmeth
garrett
had
gone
back
to
the
farm
after
all
without
seeing
me
and
the
moment
tommy
came
through
the
gate
i
had
one
of
those
rifts
of
lucidity
in
which
i
saw
him
whole
and
limited
pasted
flat
against
the
background
of
taylorville
without
any
perspective
of
imagination
and
was
taken
mightily
with
the
wish
to
explain
to
him
where
he
stood
once
for
all
outside
and
disconnected
with
anything
that
was
vital
and
important
to
me
but
quite
unexpectedly
before
i
could
frame
a
beginning
he
had
presented
himself
to
me
in
a
new
light
he
was
cover
something
to
get
behind
in
order
to
exercise
myself
more
freely
in
the
things
he
could
understand
something
more
was
bound
to
come
out
of
my
relation
to
helmeth
garrett
the
incident
could
go
on
hanging
in
the
air
that
way
and
in
the
meantime
here
was
an
opportunity
to
put
it
out
of
public
attention
by
going
out
with
tommy
it
did
hang
in
the
air
however
for
three
days
during
which
i
pulsed
and
sickened
with
expectancy
by
thursday
it
had
reached
a
point
where
i
knew
that
if
helmeth
garrett
did
come
and
kiss
me
again
i
should
be
able
to
bear
it
it
was
soon
after
sundown
that
i
felt
him
coming
i
took
a
great
many
turns
in
the
garden
which
carrying
me
occasionally
out
of
reach
of
the
click
of
the
gate
latch
afforded
me
the
relief
of
thinking
that
he
might
have
arrived
in
the
interval
when
i
was
out
of
hearing
his
approaching
tread
was
within
me
when
it
was
just
seven
my
mother
came
out
and
called
olivia
i
promised
endsleigh
a
starter
of
yeast
i
have
just
remembered
could
you
take
it
to
her
the
endsleigh
backyard
was
separated
from
ours
by
a
vacant
lot
the
houses
fronting
on
parallel
streets
there
was
no
sound
at
the
gate
and
mother
had
the
bowl
in
a
white
napkin
held
out
to
me
with
a
long
message
about
where
the
sewing
circle
was
to
meet
next
thursday
if
any
body
comes
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
have
kept
that
back
you
can
tell
them
i
be
back
in
a
minute
i
cautioned
her
are
you
expecting
anybody
only
tommy
i
prevaricated
instantly
and
unaccountably
i
saw
my
mother
look
at
me
rather
oddly
over
the
tops
of
the
glasses
she
had
lately
assumed
on
the
endsleigh
back
porch
i
found
belle
in
evening
dress
gathering
ivy
berries
for
her
hair
oh
she
said
to
my
plain
appearance
are
you
going
going
where
oh
if
you
do
know
to
flora
belle
was
embarrassed
i
had
heard
of
it
it
just
a
few
friends
belle
wavered
between
sympathy
and
superiority
flora
is
so
particular
i
could
have
gone
anyway
i
interpolated
i
have
an
engagement
i
had
to
find
endsleigh
after
that
and
deliver
my
errand
when
i
reached
home
mother
was
sitting
placidly
just
outside
the
circle
of
the
lamp
knitting
she
only
looked
up
as
i
entered
and
i
had
to
drag
it
out
of
her
at
last
has
anybody
been
here
nobody
that
you
would
care
to
see
but
who
that
young
man
who
tried
to
speak
to
you
on
sunday
glad
you
have
a
proper
feeling
about
such
things
garrett
nephew
did
you
say
i
told
him
you
were
engaged
oh
mother
i
was
out
in
panting
haste
at
the
gate
i
ran
square
into
tommy
bettersworth
did
you
see
anybody
nobody
i
came
through
by
davis
i
was
coming
in
he
suggested
as
i
stood
peering
into
the
dark
i
thought
you
be
going
to
flora
a
wild
hope
flashed
in
me
that
maybe
he
was
going
and
i
should
be
rid
of
him
oh
i
do
care
much
for
that
crowd
i
told
her
i
had
an
engagement
with
you
so
he
had
known
i
was
not
to
be
invited
i
resented
the
liberty
of
his
defence
let
go
down
to
niles
and
have
some
ice
cream
tommy
propitiated
it
too
cold
for
ice
cream
i
led
the
way
back
to
the
house
i
was
satisfied
there
was
no
one
in
the
street
when
we
stepped
into
the
fan
of
light
from
the
lit
window
tommy
saw
my
face
oh
i
say
ollie
you
must
take
it
like
that
beastly
cats
girls
are
flora
just
jealous
because
she
thought
she
was
invited
to
the
picnic
for
that
garrett
chap
and
you
got
him
she
wants
to
have
a
chance
at
him
herself
there
was
a
garden
seat
on
the
porch
between
the
front
windows
i
sat
down
in
it
it
not
flora
i
crying
about
it
is
being
so
misunderstood
i
was
thinking
that
helmeth
garrett
would
suppose
i
had
stayed
away
from
flora
on
his
account
she
would
never
dare
to
say
she
had
not
invited
me
tommy
arm
came
comfortingly
along
the
back
of
the
bench
it
just
because
they
do
understand
that
they
are
mad
they
know
a
fellow
would
give
his
eyes
to
kiss
you
infernal
cad
to
snatch
it
like
that
and
i
never
even
asked
you
for
one
his
voice
was
very
close
to
my
ear
i
tell
you
olivia
i
thought
of
something
if
you
were
to
be
engaged
to
me
you
know
i
always
wanted
then
nobody
would
have
a
right
to
say
anything
they
see
that
you
just
left
it
to
me
oh
i
blurted
it
not
so
bad
as
that
you
think
about
it
he
urged
i
do
want
to
bother
you
but
if
you
need
it
why
here
i
am
it
was
because
i
was
thinking
of
him
so
little
that
i
had
noticed
where
tommy
arm
had
got
by
this
time
that
unfulfilled
kiss
had
seemed
somehow
to
leave
me
unimaginably
exposed
assailed
i
was
needing
desperately
then
to
be
kissed
again
to
find
myself
revalued
it
awfully
good
of
you
tommy
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
that
neither
of
us
heard
forester
come
up
from
the
gate
all
at
once
there
was
his
foot
on
the
step
as
he
came
into
the
porch
a
soft
sound
drew
him
he
stared
blankly
on
us
for
a
moment
and
then
laughed
shortly
oh
it
you
this
time
bettersworth
i
thought
it
might
be
that
garrett
chap
that
was
unkind
of
forester
but
there
were
extenuations
i
found
afterward
that
belle
had
teased
flora
to
ask
him
and
he
had
refused
thinking
it
unbrotherly
when
i
was
not
to
be
invited
and
he
and
belle
had
quarrelled
i
do
know
as
it
matters
to
you
tommy
was
valiant
whom
she
kisses
if
i
do
mind
it
you
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
it
well
a
lot
i
engaged
to
her
book
ii
chapter
i
the
first
notion
of
an
obligation
i
had
in
writing
this
part
of
my
story
was
that
if
it
is
to
be
serviceable
no
lingering
sentiment
should
render
it
less
than
literal
and
none
of
that
egotism
turned
inside
out
which
makes
a
kind
sanctity
of
the
personal
experience
prevent
me
from
offering
it
whole
and
the
next
was
that
the
only
way
in
which
it
could
be
made
to
appear
in
its
complete
pitiableness
would
be
to
write
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
tommy
bettersworth
for
after
all
i
have
emerged
retarded
crippled
in
my
affectional
capacities
bodily
the
worse
but
still
with
wings
to
spread
and
some
disposition
toward
flying
and
when
i
think
of
the
dreams
tommy
had
how
he
must
have
figured
in
them
to
himself
large
between
me
and
all
misadventure
adored
dependable
and
then
how
he
blundered
and
lost
himself
in
the
mazes
of
unsuitability
i
find
bitterness
augmenting
in
me
not
on
my
account
but
his
the
amazing
pity
of
it
was
that
it
might
all
have
turned
out
very
well
if
i
had
been
what
i
seemed
to
him
and
to
my
family
at
the
time
when
i
let
him
engage
himself
to
me
to
save
me
from
immanent
embarrassment
my
mother
though
she
took
on
for
the
occasion
an
appropriate
solemnity
was
frankly
relieved
to
have
me
so
well
disposed
tommy
had
been
brought
up
in
the
church
had
no
bad
habits
and
was
earning
a
reasonable
salary
with
burton
brothers
tailors
and
outfitters
there
was
nobody
whose
business
it
was
to
tell
me
that
i
did
not
love
tommy
enough
to
marry
him
i
have
often
wondered
supposing
a
medium
of
communication
had
been
established
between
my
mother
and
me
if
i
had
told
her
how
much
more
that
other
kiss
had
meant
to
me
than
tommy
mild
osculation
she
would
have
understood
or
made
a
fight
for
me
i
am
afraid
she
would
only
have
seen
in
it
evidence
of
an
infatuation
for
an
undesirable
young
man
one
who
smoked
and
drove
rakishly
about
town
in
red
neckties
on
sunday
morning
but
in
fact
i
liked
tommy
immensely
the
mating
instinct
was
awake
all
our
world
clapped
us
forward
to
the
adventure
if
you
ask
what
the
inward
monitor
was
about
on
this
occasion
i
will
say
that
it
is
always
and
singularly
inept
at
human
estimates
if
often
in
search
of
companionship
its
eye
is
removed
from
the
mark
to
fix
upon
the
personal
environment
it
is
still
unfurnished
to
divine
behind
which
plain
exterior
lives
another
like
itself
i
took
tommy
community
of
interest
for
granted
on
the
evidence
of
his
loving
me
though
indeed
after
all
these
years
i
am
not
quite
clear
why
he
why
forester
and
pauline
could
have
walked
in
the
way
with
me
toward
the
shining
destiny
i
was
not
conscious
of
any
private
advantage
certainly
so
far
as
our
beginnings
were
concerned
none
showed
and
i
should
have
been
glad
of
their
company
and
here
at
the
end
i
am
walking
in
it
alone
about
a
month
after
my
engagement
henry
mills
proposed
to
pauline
and
she
began
preparations
to
be
married
the
following
june
tommy
salary
not
being
thought
to
justify
it
so
soon
the
idea
of
my
own
marriage
had
not
come
very
close
to
me
until
i
began
to
help
pauline
work
initials
on
table
linen
the
chief
difference
between
pauline
and
me
had
been
that
she
had
lived
all
her
life
so
to
speak
at
home
nothing
exigent
to
her
social
order
had
ever
found
her
out
but
olivia
seemed
always
to
be
at
the
top
of
the
house
or
somewhere
in
the
back
garden
to
whom
the
normal
occasions
presented
themselves
as
a
succession
of
cards
under
the
door
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
actually
missed
any
of
these
appointed
visitors
but
all
my
early
life
comes
back
to
me
as
a
series
of
importunate
callers
whose
names
i
was
not
sure
of
and
who
distracted
me
frightfully
from
something
vastly
more
pleasant
and
important
that
i
wanted
very
much
to
do
without
knowing
very
well
what
it
was
but
it
was
in
the
long
afternoons
when
pauline
and
i
sat
upstairs
together
sewing
on
our
white
things
that
i
began
to
take
notice
of
the
relation
of
what
happened
to
me
to
the
things
that
went
on
inside
and
to
be
intrigued
away
from
the
vision
by
the
possibility
of
turning
it
into
facts
of
line
and
colour
and
suitability
it
was
the
beginning
of
my
realizing
what
came
afterward
to
be
such
a
bitter
and
engrossing
need
with
me
the
need
of
money
much
that
had
struck
inharmoniously
on
me
in
the
furnishings
of
taylorville
had
identified
itself
so
with
the
point
of
view
there
that
i
had
come
to
think
of
the
one
as
being
the
natural
and
inevitable
expression
of
the
other
now
with
the
growing
appreciation
of
a
home
of
my
own
as
a
medium
of
i
accepted
its
possibility
of
limitation
by
the
figure
of
my
husband
income
without
being
entirely
daunted
thereby
for
i
was
still
of
the
young
opinion
that
getting
rich
involved
no
more
serious
matter
than
setting
about
it
as
i
saw
it
then
men
tailoring
and
outfitting
did
not
appear
an
unlikely
beginning
if
tommy
had
achieved
the
magnificence
i
planned
for
him
it
would
have
been
on
the
whole
more
remarkable
than
what
has
happened
what
i
had
to
reckon
with
later
was
the
astonishing
fact
that
tommy
liked
plush
furniture
and
liked
it
red
for
choice
i
do
not
know
why
it
should
have
taken
me
by
surprise
to
find
him
in
harmony
with
his
bringing
up
there
was
no
reason
for
the
case
being
otherwise
except
as
i
seemed
to
find
one
in
his
being
fond
of
me
his
mother
house
was
not
unlike
other
taylorvillian
homes
more
austerely
kept
the
blinds
were
always
pulled
down
in
the
best
room
and
they
never
opened
the
piano
except
when
there
was
company
or
for
the
little
girls
to
practise
their
music
lessons
bettersworth
was
a
large
fair
woman
with
pale
prominent
eyes
and
pale
hair
pulled
back
from
a
corrugated
forehead
and
his
sisters
who
were
all
younger
than
tommy
were
exactly
like
her
their
eyes
if
possible
more
protruded
which
you
felt
to
be
owing
to
their
hair
being
braided
very
tightly
in
two
braids
as
far
apart
as
possible
at
the
corners
of
their
heads
they
treated
me
always
with
the
greatest
respect
if
there
had
been
anybody
who
could
have
thrown
any
light
on
the
situation
it
would
have
been
bettersworth
he
was
a
dry
man
with
what
passed
in
taylorville
for
an
eccentric
turn
of
mind
he
had
for
instance
been
known
to
justify
himself
for
putting
tommy
to
the
men
outfitters
rather
than
to
his
own
business
of
building
and
contracting
on
the
ground
that
tommy
wanted
the
imagination
for
it
just
as
if
an
imagination
could
be
of
use
to
anybody
so
you
are
going
to
undertake
to
make
tommy
happy
he
said
to
me
on
the
occasion
of
my
taking
supper
with
the
family
as
a
formal
acknowledgment
of
my
engagement
do
you
think
i
can
do
it
he
was
looking
at
me
rather
quizzically
and
i
really
wished
to
know
oh
i
was
wondering
he
said
what
you
would
do
with
what
you
had
left
over
but
it
was
years
before
i
understood
what
he
meant
by
that
about
the
time
i
was
bridesmaid
for
pauline
tommy
had
an
advantageous
offer
that
put
our
marriage
almost
immediately
within
reach
burton
brothers
was
a
branch
house
one
of
a
score
with
the
head
at
chicago
to
whom
tommy
had
so
commended
himself
under
the
stimulus
of
being
engaged
that
on
the
establishment
of
a
new
store
in
higgleston
they
offered
him
the
sales
department
there
was
also
to
be
a
working
tailor
and
a
superintendent
visiting
it
regularly
from
chicago
which
its
nearness
to
the
metropolis
allowed
all
that
we
knew
of
higgleston
was
that
it
was
a
long
settled
farming
community
which
having
discovered
itself
at
the
junction
of
two
railway
lines
that
approached
chicago
from
the
southeast
conceived
itself
to
have
arrived
there
by
some
native
superiority
and
awoke
to
the
expectation
of
importance
it
lay
as
respects
taylorville
no
great
distance
beyond
the
flat
horizon
of
the
north
where
the
prairie
broke
into
wooded
land
again
far
enough
north
not
to
have
been
fanned
by
the
hot
blast
of
the
war
and
the
spiritual
struggle
that
preceded
it
and
so
to
have
missed
the
revitalizing
processes
that
crowded
the
few
succeeding
years
whatever
difference
there
was
between
it
and
taylorville
besides
population
was
just
the
difference
between
a
community
that
has
fought
and
one
that
stood
looking
on
at
the
fight
it
was
not
far
enough
from
taylorville
to
have
struck
out
anything
new
for
itself
in
manners
or
furniture
but
the
necessity
of
going
south
two
or
three
hours
to
change
cars
and
north
again
several
hours
more
set
up
an
illusion
of
change
which
led
to
a
disappointment
in
its
want
of
variety
tommy
went
out
in
july
and
in
a
month
wrote
me
that
he
would
be
able
to
come
for
me
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
and
hoping
it
would
not
be
long
if
i
had
looked
as
in
the
last
hesitancies
of
girlhood
i
believe
i
did
for
my
mother
to
have
raised
an
objection
to
my
going
so
far
from
home
i
found
myself
instead
almost
with
the
feeling
of
being
pushed
out
of
the
nest
it
seemed
as
if
in
hastening
me
out
of
the
family
she
would
be
the
sooner
free
to
give
herself
without
reproach
to
a
new
and
extraordinary
scheme
of
forester
what
i
guess
now
to
have
been
in
part
the
motive
was
that
she
already
had
been
touched
by
the
warning
of
that
disorder
which
finally
carried
her
off
which
with
the
curious
futility
of
timid
women
she
hoped
by
not
mentioning
to
postpone
for
a
long
time
now
forester
had
found
himself
in
the
situation
of
having
grown
beyond
his
virtues
that
assumption
of
mannishness
which
sat
so
prettily
on
his
nonage
was
rendered
inconspicuous
by
his
majority
people
who
had
forgotten
that
he
had
never
had
any
boyhood
found
nothing
especially
commendable
in
the
mild
soberness
of
i
have
a
notion
too
that
the
happy
circumstance
of
my
marriage
lit
up
for
him
some
personal
phases
which
he
could
hardly
have
regarded
with
complacence
for
by
this
time
he
had
passed
in
his
character
of
philanderer
from
being
hopefully
regarded
as
reclaimable
to
constancy
to
a
sort
of
public
understudy
in
the
practice
of
the
affections
however
it
had
come
about
the
young
ladies
who
still
took
on
forester
at
intervals
no
longer
looked
on
him
so
much
as
privileged
but
as
eminently
safe
and
the
number
of
girls
in
a
given
community
who
can
be
counted
on
for
such
a
performance
is
limited
that
summer
before
i
was
married
after
belle
endsleigh
had
run
away
from
home
with
a
commercial
traveller
who
disappointed
the
moral
instance
by
making
her
a
very
good
husband
afterward
my
brother
found
himself
as
regards
the
young
people
world
in
a
situation
of
uneasy
detachment
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
coöperative
where
he
had
been
seven
years
bored
him
excessively
it
was
then
he
conceived
the
idea
of
reinstating
himself
in
the
atmosphere
of
importance
by
setting
himself
up
in
business
adjacent
to
niles
ice
cream
parlours
there
was
a
small
stationery
and
news
agency
which
might
be
bought
and
enlarged
to
creditable
proportions
there
was
i
believe
actually
nothing
to
be
urged
against
this
as
a
matter
of
business
the
difficulty
was
that
to
accomplish
it
my
mother
would
be
obliged
to
hypothecate
the
whole
of
her
small
capital
what
my
mother
really
thought
about
her
property
was
that
she
held
it
in
trust
for
the
family
interest
and
that
with
the
secret
intimation
of
her
end
which
i
surmise
must
have
reached
her
by
this
time
she
believed
to
be
served
by
forester
plan
it
was
so
much
the
general
view
that
by
marrying
i
took
myself
out
of
the
family
altogether
that
i
felt
convinced
that
she
meant
so
soon
as
that
was
accomplished
to
undertake
what
in
the
face
of
my
protesting
attitude
she
had
not
the
courage
to
begin
i
remember
how
shocked
she
was
at
my
telling
her
that
this
tying
up
of
the
two
ends
of
life
in
a
monetary
obligation
would
put
her
and
forester
very
much
in
the
situation
of
a
young
man
married
to
a
woman
i
mention
this
here
because
the
implication
that
grew
out
of
it
of
my
marriage
being
looked
forward
to
as
a
relief
had
much
to
do
with
the
failure
out
of
my
life
at
this
juncture
of
informing
intimacy
a
great
deal
of
necessary
information
had
come
my
way
through
marriage
through
the
comment
set
free
by
belle
endsleigh
affair
through
the
natural
awakening
of
my
mind
toward
the
intimations
of
books
marriage
i
began
to
perceive
as
an
engulfing
personal
experience
until
now
i
had
been
able
to
think
of
it
except
as
a
means
of
providing
pleasant
companionship
on
the
way
toward
that
large
and
shining
world
for
which
i
felt
myself
forever
and
unassailably
fit
it
began
to
exhibit
now
through
vistas
that
allured
the
aspect
of
a
vast
inhuman
grin
somewhere
out
of
this
prospect
of
sympathy
and
understanding
arose
upon
you
the
tremendous
inundation
of
life
dimly
beyond
the
point
of
tommy
joyous
possession
of
me
i
was
aware
of
an
incalculable
force
by
which
the
whole
province
of
my
being
was
assailed
very
different
from
the
girlish
prevision
of
motherhood
which
had
floated
with
the
fragrance
of
orris
root
from
aunt
alice
bureau
drawer
in
the
allingham
spare
room
i
do
say
this
is
the
way
all
girls
feel
about
the
approach
of
maternity
but
i
saw
it
then
like
the
wolf
in
the
fairy
tale
which
as
soon
as
its
head
was
admitted
thrust
in
a
shoulder
and
so
came
bodily
into
the
room
and
devoured
the
protestant
long
afterward
when
i
was
in
a
position
to
know
something
of
the
private
experience
of
trapeze
performers
i
learned
that
they
came
to
a
point
sometimes
in
when
the
body
apprised
them
of
inadequacy
a
warning
sure
to
be
followed
in
no
long
time
by
disaster
i
have
thought
sometimes
that
what
reached
me
then
was
the
advice
of
a
body
instinctively
aware
of
being
unequal
to
the
demands
about
to
be
imposed
upon
it
i
hardly
know
now
by
what
road
i
arrived
at
the
certainty
that
some
women
pauline
for
instance
were
able
to
face
this
looming
terror
of
childbearing
by
making
terms
with
it
life
it
appeared
waited
at
their
doors
with
respect
modified
the
edge
of
its
inevitableness
to
their
convenience
if
pauline
had
been
accessible
but
she
was
living
in
chicago
with
henry
mills
going
out
a
great
deal
and
writing
me
infrequent
letters
of
bright
complacency
it
was
only
in
the
last
frightened
gasp
i
fixed
upon
my
mother
you
must
imagine
for
yourself
from
what
you
know
of
nice
girls
thirty
years
ago
how
inarticulate
the
whole
business
was
the
most
i
can
do
is
to
have
you
understand
my
desperate
need
to
know
to
interpose
between
marriage
and
maternity
never
so
slight
an
interval
in
which
to
collect
myself
and
leave
off
shrinking
about
a
week
before
my
wedding
we
were
sitting
together
at
the
close
of
the
afternoon
my
mother
had
taken
up
her
knitting
as
her
habit
was
when
the
light
failed
something
in
the
work
we
had
been
doing
putting
the
last
touches
to
my
wedding
dress
led
her
to
speak
of
her
own
and
of
my
father
as
a
young
man
the
mention
pricked
me
to
notice
what
i
recall
now
as
characteristic
of
taylorville
women
that
with
all
she
had
been
through
the
war
her
eight
children
so
many
graves
there
was
still
in
her
attitude
toward
all
these
a
kind
of
untutored
virginity
it
made
my
noticing
it
then
and
being
touched
by
it
a
sort
of
bridge
by
which
it
seemed
for
the
moment
she
might
be
drawn
over
to
my
side
on
the
impulse
i
spoke
mother
i
said
i
want
to
know
it
seemed
a
natural
sort
of
knowledge
to
which
any
woman
had
a
right
almost
before
the
question
was
out
i
saw
the
expression
of
offended
shock
come
over
my
mother
reminiscent
softness
the
nearly
animal
rage
of
terror
with
which
the
unknown
the
unaccustomed
assailed
her
olivia
olivia
she
stood
up
her
knitting
rigid
in
her
hands
the
ball
of
it
speeding
away
in
the
dusk
of
the
floor
on
some
private
terror
of
its
own
olivia
i
not
hear
of
such
things
you
are
not
to
speak
of
them
do
you
understand
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
i
wanted
to
know
i
said
i
thought
you
could
tell
me
i
went
over
and
stood
by
the
window
a
little
dry
snow
was
blowing
it
was
the
first
week
in
november
beginning
to
collect
on
the
edges
of
the
walks
and
along
the
fences
the
landscape
showed
sketched
in
white
on
a
background
of
neutral
gray
i
heard
a
movement
in
the
room
behind
me
my
mother
came
presently
and
stood
looking
out
with
me
she
was
very
pale
scared
but
commiserating
somehow
my
question
had
glanced
in
striking
the
dying
nerve
of
long
since
encountered
dreads
and
pains
we
faced
them
together
there
in
the
cold
twilight
i
sorry
daughter
she
hesitated
i
ca
help
you
i
know
i
never
knew
myself
chapter
ii
it
is
no
doubt
owing
to
the
habit
of
life
in
higgleston
being
so
little
differentiated
from
taylorville
that
i
was
never
able
to
get
any
other
impression
of
it
than
as
a
place
one
put
up
at
on
the
way
to
some
other
always
it
bore
to
my
mind
the
air
of
a
traveller
room
in
one
of
those
stops
where
it
is
necessary
to
open
the
trunks
but
not
worth
while
to
unpack
them
nor
do
i
think
it
was
altogether
owing
to
what
i
left
there
that
my
recollection
of
it
centres
paganly
about
the
cemetery
in
taylorville
love
and
birth
though
but
scantily
removed
from
the
savour
of
impropriety
were
still
the
salient
facts
of
existence
but
in
higgleston
a
funeral
was
your
real
human
occasion
it
was
as
if
the
rural
fear
of
innovation
had
thrown
them
back
for
a
pivotal
centre
upon
the
point
of
continuity
with
their
past
it
was
a
generous
rolling
space
set
aside
for
the
dead
abutting
on
two
sides
on
the
boardwalks
of
the
town
stretching
back
by
dips
and
hollows
to
the
wooded
pastures
near
the
gates
which
opened
from
the
walk
it
was
divided
off
in
single
plots
and
family
allotments
scattering
more
and
more
to
the
farthest
neglected
mounds
that
crept
obscurely
under
the
hazel
thickets
and
the
sapling
oaks
happiest
when
named
the
least
assimilated
quickliest
to
their
native
earth
it
was
this
that
rendered
the
pagan
touch
for
though
nearly
all
higgleston
was
and
looked
forward
to
a
heaven
they
seemed
to
me
never
quite
dissevered
from
the
untutored
pastures
to
which
their
whole
living
and
dying
was
a
process
of
being
reabsorbed
higgleston
until
this
junction
of
railroads
occurred
had
been
a
close
settled
farming
community
and
a
vague
notion
of
civic
improvement
had
ripped
through
the
centre
of
its
wide
old
yards
and
comfortable
country
looking
dwellings
a
shadeless
unpaved
street
lined
with
what
were
known
as
business
blocks
with
a
tendency
to
run
mostly
to
front
and
a
general
placarded
state
of
being
to
let
or
about
to
be
opened
on
these
premises
beyond
the
railway
station
there
was
a
dingy
region
devoted
to
car
shops
and
cheap
lodgings
known
locally
as
track
town
whose
inhabitants
were
forever
at
odds
with
the
older
rural
population
withdrawing
itself
into
a
kind
of
aristocracy
of
priority
and
propriety
and
between
these
an
intermediary
group
self
styled
the
leading
business
men
of
the
town
forever
and
trivially
busy
to
reconcile
the
two
factions
in
the
interests
of
trade
that
tommy
was
by
reason
of
his
position
as
managing
salesman
of
burton
brothers
generically
of
this
class
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
my
never
having
formed
any
vital
or
lasting
relations
with
either
community
and
it
might
have
been
for
quite
other
reasons
for
in
the
very
beginning
of
my
stay
there
life
had
seized
me
that
bubbling
frothing
force
working
forever
to
breach
the
film
of
existence
i
was
used
by
it
i
was
abused
by
it
for
what
does
life
care
what
it
does
to
the
tender
bodies
of
women
my
baby
was
born
within
ten
months
of
my
marriage
and
most
of
that
time
i
was
wretchedly
depressingly
all
my
memories
of
my
early
married
life
are
of
olivia
in
the
mornings
still
with
frost
cowering
away
from
the
kitchen
sights
and
smells
or
gasping
up
out
of
engulfing
nausea
to
sit
out
the
duty
calls
of
the
leading
ladies
of
higgleston
in
the
cold
disordered
house
of
tommy
gulping
unsuitable
meals
of
underdone
and
overdone
things
and
washing
the
day
accumulation
of
dishes
after
business
hours
patient
and
portentously
cheerful
with
olivia
in
a
wrapper
half
hysterical
with
weakness
all
the
young
wife
dreams
gone
awry
and
tommy
too
he
must
have
had
visions
of
himself
coming
home
to
a
house
of
delicious
little
dinners
and
long
hours
in
which
he
should
appear
in
his
proper
character
as
the
adored
achieving
male
not
long
ago
i
read
a
book
of
a
man
life
written
by
a
man
in
which
he
justified
himself
of
unfaithfulness
because
his
wife
appeared
before
him
habitually
in
curl
papers
and
there
were
days
when
i
could
even
do
my
hair
in
the
beginning
we
had
taken
in
respect
to
tommy
position
among
those
same
live
business
men
a
house
rather
too
large
for
us
and
we
had
counted
on
the
wages
of
a
servant
now
with
the
necessity
upon
us
of
laying
by
money
for
the
great
expense
we
felt
less
justified
in
it
than
ever
this
pinch
of
necessity
was
of
the
quality
of
corrosion
on
what
must
have
been
meant
for
the
consummate
experience
i
have
to
dwell
on
it
here
because
in
this
practical
confusion
of
my
illness
was
laid
the
foundation
of
our
later
failure
to
come
together
on
any
working
basis
we
had
in
fact
time
to
find
it
no
time
to
understand
none
whatever
in
which
to
explore
the
use
of
passion
and
react
into
that
superunion
of
which
the
bodily
relation
is
the
overt
sign
young
things
we
were
who
had
not
fairly
known
each
other
as
man
and
woman
before
we
were
compelled
to
trace
in
one
another
the
lineaments
of
parents
all
attention
drawn
away
from
the
imperative
business
of
framing
a
common
ideal
to
centre
on
the
child
what
this
precipitance
accomplished
was
that
instead
of
being
drawn
insensibly
to
find
in
the
exigencies
of
marriage
the
natural
unfolding
of
that
inward
vitality
always
much
stronger
in
me
than
any
exterior
phase
i
was
by
the
shock
of
too
early
maternity
driven
apart
from
the
usual
and
i
still
believe
the
happier
destiny
of
women
with
all
this
we
were
spared
the
bitterness
of
the
unwelcoming
thought
little
homely
memories
swim
up
beyond
the
pains
and
depressions
to
mark
like
twigs
and
leafage
on
a
freshet
the
swelling
of
the
new
affection
effie
at
montecito
overruling
all
my
mother
shocked
suggestions
as
to
her
supposed
obliviousness
of
my
condition
sitting
up
nights
to
sew
for
me
the
dress
i
tried
to
make
myself
the
bureau
drawer
from
which
i
used
to
take
the
little
things
every
night
to
look
at
them
the
smell
of
orris
see
tommy
i
done
so
much
is
it
pretty
my
dear
you
shown
that
to
me
at
least
forty
times
and
i
always
said
so
yes
but
is
it
the
little
sleeves
did
you
think
anything
be
so
small
tommy
do
you
wish
it
would
we
had
to
make
what
we
could
of
these
moments
of
thrilled
expectancy
of
tender
brooding
curiosity
i
scarcely
recall
now
all
the
reasons
why
it
was
thought
best
for
me
to
go
back
to
my
mother
in
august
and
to
the
family
physician
but
i
find
it
all
pertinent
to
my
subject
whatever
was
done
there
was
mostly
wrong
though
i
was
years
finding
it
out
i
mean
that
whatever
chance
i
had
of
growing
up
into
the
competent
mother
of
a
family
was
probably
lost
to
me
through
the
inexactitudes
of
country
practice
we
had
then
arrived
at
the
realization
that
the
well
or
ill
going
of
maternity
is
a
matter
of
sceptics
rather
than
sentiment
taylorville
was
a
town
of
ten
thousand
inhabitants
but
at
that
time
no
one
had
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
a
trained
nurse
the
business
of
midwifery
was
given
over
in
general
to
a
widow
so
little
attractive
that
she
was
thought
not
to
have
a
chance
of
marrying
again
and
by
the
circumstance
of
having
had
two
or
three
children
of
her
own
believed
to
be
eminently
fit
to
first
encounter
with
the
rending
powers
of
life
there
went
any
amount
of
affectionate
consideration
and
much
old
wives
lore
of
an
extraordinary
character
it
seems
hardly
credible
now
but
in
the
beginning
of
things
going
wrong
there
were
symptoms
concealed
from
the
doctor
on
the
ground
of
delicacy
my
baby
too
poor
little
man
was
feeble
from
birth
a
bottle
baby
the
best
that
could
have
been
done
would
hardly
have
been
a
chance
for
him
lying
there
in
the
hot
close
room
all
the
air
shut
out
with
the
light
in
the
midst
of
pains
i
made
a
fight
for
him
tried
to
interpose
such
scraps
of
better
knowledge
as
had
come
to
me
through
reading
but
they
made
no
headway
against
my
mother
confidential
well
i
ought
to
know
i
buried
five
and
against
forester
who
by
the
added
importance
of
having
invested
all
her
fortune
had
gained
such
way
with
my
mother
that
she
listened
respectfully
to
his
explication
of
what
should
be
done
for
the
baby
it
was
forester
who
overbore
with
ridicule
my
suggestion
that
he
should
be
fed
at
regular
hours
for
which
i
never
forgave
him
but
i
had
enough
to
do
to
fortify
my
racked
body
against
the
time
when
i
should
be
obliged
to
get
up
and
go
on
again
as
it
seemed
privately
i
never
should
be
able
and
they
were
all
so
fond
and
proud
of
my
little
thomas
henry
he
was
named
so
for
his
father
and
mine
effie
simply
adored
him
the
wonder
of
his
smallness
the
way
in
which
he
moved
his
limbs
and
opened
and
shut
his
eyes
quite
as
if
there
had
never
been
one
born
before
the
way
they
hung
over
him
and
the
wrong
things
they
did
even
cousin
lydia
drove
into
church
the
first
sunday
after
for
the
purpose
of
holding
him
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
her
large
silk
poplin
arms
at
the
end
of
which
time
she
had
softened
almost
to
the
point
of
confidence
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
one
once
she
admitted
but
somehow
i
could
seem
to
manage
it
she
looked
over
to
where
cousin
judd
sat
with
my
mother
he
was
always
fond
of
young
ones
it
occurred
to
me
then
that
cousin
lydia
was
probably
a
much
misunderstood
woman
of
the
next
six
months
at
higgleston
after
i
returned
to
it
with
a
three
months
old
baby
i
have
scarcely
any
recollection
that
is
not
mixed
up
with
bodily
torment
for
myself
and
anxiety
for
the
child
i
think
it
probable
that
most
of
that
time
my
husband
found
the
house
badly
kept
the
meals
irregular
and
his
wife
hysterical
i
had
anything
to
spare
with
which
to
consider
what
figure
i
might
have
cut
in
the
eyes
of
the
onlooker
tommy
shines
out
for
me
in
that
period
by
reason
of
the
unwearying
patience
and
cheerfulness
with
which
he
successfully
ignored
the
general
unsatisfactoriness
of
his
home
and
at
times
for
a
certain
exasperation
i
had
with
him
as
if
by
being
somehow
less
quiescent
he
might
have
opposed
a
better
front
to
the
encroachments
of
distress
we
did
try
help
in
the
kitchen
after
our
finances
had
a
little
recovered
from
the
strain
of
my
confinement
a
higgleston
girl
of
no
very
great
competence
and
a
sort
of
visiting
acquaintance
with
two
thirds
of
the
community
her
chief
accomplishments
while
she
stayed
with
us
were
concocted
out
of
the
scraps
and
fag
ends
of
our
private
conversations
i
could
always
tell
that
ida
had
overheard
something
by
the
alacrity
with
which
she
banged
the
pots
about
in
the
kitchen
in
order
that
she
might
get
through
with
her
work
and
go
out
and
tell
somebody
in
the
end
tommy
said
that
when
it
came
to
a
choice
between
getting
his
own
meals
and
losing
his
best
customers
he
preferred
the
former
all
this
time
i
did
not
know
how
ill
i
was
because
of
the
consuming
anxiety
for
the
baby
i
remember
times
in
the
night
the
dreadful
momentary
revolt
of
my
body
rousing
to
this
new
demand
upon
it
before
the
mind
waked
to
the
selfless
consideration
and
the
failure
of
composure
which
was
as
much
weakness
as
fear
the
long
watching
the
walking
to
and
fro
and
the
debates
as
to
whether
we
ought
or
ought
not
to
venture
on
the
expense
of
the
doctor
and
for
long
years
afterward
what
is
the
bitterest
of
bitterness
finding
out
that
we
had
done
the
wrong
thing
to
this
day
i
can
not
come
across
any
notices
of
the
more
competent
methods
for
the
care
of
delicate
children
without
a
remembering
pang
all
the
time
this
was
going
on
i
was
aware
by
a
secondary
detached
sort
of
self
that
there
was
a
point
somewhere
beyond
this
perplexity
of
pain
at
which
the
joyful
possession
of
my
son
should
begin
i
was
anxious
to
get
at
him
to
have
speech
with
him
to
realize
his
identity
any
woman
will
understand
and
along
about
the
time
the
blue
flags
and
the
and
the
white
bridal
wreaths
were
at
their
best
in
the
cemetery
it
came
upon
me
terrifyingly
that
i
might
after
all
have
to
let
him
go
without
it
we
were
walking
there
that
day
the
first
we
had
thought
it
safe
to
take
the
baby
out
for
it
was
customary
to
walk
in
the
cemetery
on
sunday
and
almost
obligatory
to
your
social
standing
the
oaks
were
budding
and
the
wind
in
the
irises
and
the
shadow
of
them
on
the
tombstones
and
the
people
all
in
their
sunday
best
walking
in
the
warm
light
gave
an
effect
of
more
aliveness
than
the
sombre
yards
of
the
town
could
afford
tommy
had
taken
the
baby
from
me
for
though
i
could
somehow
never
get
enough
of
the
feel
of
him
his
head
in
the
hollow
of
my
shoulder
his
weight
against
my
arm
i
was
so
little
strong
myself
that
i
was
glad
to
pretend
that
it
was
because
he
was
really
getting
heavy
and
just
then
we
passed
a
little
mound
so
low
where
a
new
headboard
had
been
set
up
with
the
superscription
only
son
of
and
aged
eight
months
and
it
was
the
age
and
the
little
mound
was
just
the
length
of
my
boy
i
think
there
was
a
rush
of
tears
to
cover
that
the
realization
by
a
kind
of
prevision
that
it
was
just
to
that
he
was
to
come
tears
checked
in
by
the
swift
of
the
certainty
of
the
reality
of
the
absoluteness
of
human
experience
for
by
whatever
mystery
or
magic
he
had
come
to
identity
through
me
he
was
my
son
as
i
knew
and
not
even
death
could
so
unmake
him
i
dwell
upon
this
and
one
other
incident
which
i
shall
relate
in
its
proper
place
as
all
that
was
offered
to
me
of
the
traditional
compensation
for
what
women
are
supposed
to
be
if
a
sedulous
social
ideal
has
kept
them
from
the
world
touch
through
knowledge
and
achievement
it
has
been
because
sincerely
enough
they
have
not
been
supposed
to
be
prevented
from
world
processes
so
much
as
directed
to
find
them
in
a
happier
way
this
would
be
reasonable
if
they
found
them
what
society
fails
to
understand
or
dishonestly
fails
to
admit
is
that
marriage
as
an
act
is
not
invariably
the
stroke
that
ushers
in
the
experience
of
being
married
whatever
proportions
the
change
in
my
life
had
assumed
to
the
outward
eye
it
was
only
by
the
imagined
pain
of
loss
that
i
began
to
perceive
that
i
could
never
be
quite
in
the
same
relation
to
things
again
and
to
identify
my
experience
with
the
world
adventure
i
had
become
by
the
way
of
giving
life
and
losing
it
a
link
in
the
chain
that
leads
from
dark
to
dark
i
had
touched
for
the
moment
a
reality
from
which
the
process
of
could
be
measured
it
was
the
most
and
the
best
i
was
to
know
of
the
incident
called
maternity
that
whether
it
were
most
bitter
or
most
sweet
it
was
irrevocable
i
suppose
though
he
was
always
so
inarticulate
that
tommy
must
have
caught
something
of
my
mood
from
me
he
did
seem
to
see
anything
ridiculous
in
my
holding
on
to
a
fold
of
the
baby
skirt
all
the
way
home
and
when
we
had
come
into
the
house
and
the
boy
was
laid
in
his
crib
again
so
wan
and
so
little
i
sat
on
my
young
husband
knee
and
cried
with
my
face
against
his
and
he
did
not
ask
me
what
it
was
about
i
think
though
that
we
had
not
yet
appreciated
how
near
we
were
to
losing
him
until
my
mother
came
to
visit
us
along
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
she
was
quite
excited
as
she
walked
up
from
the
station
with
tommy
and
for
her
almost
gay
with
the
novelty
of
spending
a
month
with
a
married
daughter
and
then
as
soon
as
she
had
sight
of
the
child
i
saw
her
checked
and
startled
inquiry
travel
from
me
to
tommy
and
back
to
the
child
meagre
little
features
and
a
new
and
amazing
tenderness
in
all
her
manner
to
me
that
night
after
i
was
in
bed
she
came
in
her
and
kissed
me
without
saying
anything
and
i
was
too
surprised
to
make
any
motion
of
response
that
was
the
first
time
i
remember
my
mother
having
kissed
me
on
anything
less
than
an
official
occasion
but
she
had
buried
five
herself
notwithstanding
my
mother
coming
and
the
care
she
took
of
the
baby
seemed
to
make
me
if
anything
less
prepared
for
the
end
there
were
new
remedies
of
my
mother
to
be
tried
which
appeared
hopeful
i
recovered
composure
thought
of
him
as
improving
when
in
fact
it
was
only
i
who
was
stronger
for
a
few
nights
uninterrupted
sleep
then
there
was
a
day
on
which
he
was
very
quiet
and
she
scarcely
put
him
down
from
her
lap
at
all
i
do
not
know
what
i
thought
of
that
nor
of
the
doctor
coming
twice
that
day
unsummoned
i
suppose
my
sensibilities
must
have
been
blunted
by
the
strain
for
i
recall
thinking
when
tommy
came
home
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
how
good
it
was
we
could
all
have
this
quiet
time
together
it
was
the
end
of
june
i
remember
the
blinds
half
drawn
against
the
sun
and
the
smell
of
lawns
newly
cut
and
the
damask
rose
by
the
window
i
was
going
about
putting
fresh
flowers
in
the
vases
a
thing
i
had
of
late
little
time
to
do
suddenly
i
noticed
tommy
crying
he
sat
close
to
my
mother
trying
to
make
the
boy
poor
little
claws
curl
round
his
finger
and
at
the
failure
tears
ran
down
unwiped
i
had
never
seen
tommy
cry
i
put
down
my
roses
uncertain
if
i
ought
to
go
to
him
and
all
at
once
my
mother
called
me
chapter
iii
very
closely
on
the
loss
of
my
baby
of
which
i
have
spared
you
as
much
as
possible
came
crowding
the
opening
movement
of
my
artistic
career
within
a
month
i
was
in
a
hospital
in
chicago
recovering
from
the
disastrous
termination
of
another
expectancy
that
had
come
scarcely
regarded
in
the
obsession
of
anxiety
and
overwork
during
the
last
weeks
of
my
boy
life
and
had
failed
to
sustain
itself
under
the
shock
of
his
death
and
after
the
hospital
there
was
a
month
of
convalescence
at
pauline
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
her
since
her
marriage
i
found
her
living
in
one
of
those
curious
compressed
city
houses
one
room
wide
and
three
deep
which
after
the
rambling
scattered
homes
of
higgleston
induced
a
feeling
of
cramp
until
i
discovered
a
kind
of
spaciousness
in
the
life
within
it
was
really
very
little
else
than
relief
from
the
accustomed
inharmonies
of
rurality
a
sort
of
scenic
air
and
light
that
answered
perfectly
so
long
as
you
believed
it
real
pauline
wall
papers
were
soft
unpatterned
with
wide
borders
her
windows
were
hung
with
plain
scrim
and
the
furniture
coverings
were
in
tone
with
the
carpets
when
ladies
called
in
the
afternoon
pauline
gave
them
tea
which
she
made
in
a
brass
kettle
over
a
spirit
lamp
you
can
scarcely
understand
what
that
kettle
stood
for
in
my
new
estimate
of
the
graciousness
of
living
a
kind
of
sacred
flame
round
which
gathered
unimagined
possibilities
for
the
dramatization
of
that
eager
inward
life
which
now
that
the
strictures
of
bodily
pain
were
loosed
began
to
press
toward
expression
it
rose
insistently
against
the
depressing
figure
my
draggled
and
defeated
condition
must
have
cut
in
the
face
of
pauline
bright
competency
and
the
quality
of
assurance
in
her
choice
of
the
things
among
which
she
moved
whatever
her
standards
of
behaviour
or
furniture
they
were
always
present
to
the
eye
not
sunk
below
the
plane
of
consciousness
like
mine
and
she
could
always
name
you
the
people
who
practised
them
or
the
places
where
they
could
be
bought
and
at
what
price
my
expressed
interest
in
the
teakettle
led
at
once
to
the
particular
department
store
where
i
saw
rows
of
them
shining
in
the
ticketed
inaccessibility
of
seven
dollars
and
cents
from
point
to
point
of
such
eminent
practicability
i
was
pricked
to
think
of
preëmpting
some
of
these
new
phases
of
suitability
for
myself
finding
myself
debarred
by
the
flatness
of
my
purse
the
effect
of
it
was
to
throw
me
back
into
the
benumbing
sense
of
personal
neglect
with
which
the
city
had
burst
upon
me
from
the
first
as
i
began
to
go
about
still
in
my
condition
i
had
been
tremendously
struck
with
the
plentitude
of
beauty
here
was
every
article
of
human
use
made
fair
and
fit
so
that
nobody
need
have
lacked
a
portion
of
it
save
for
an
inexplicable
error
in
the
means
of
distribution
i
for
instance
who
had
within
me
the
witness
of
heirship
had
none
of
it
that
i
should
have
felt
it
so
was
no
doubt
a
part
of
that
taylorvillian
fallacy
in
which
i
had
been
reared
that
all
that
was
precious
and
desirable
was
shed
as
the
natural
flower
and
fruit
of
goodness
here
confronted
with
the
concrete
preciousness
of
the
shop
windows
i
realized
that
if
there
had
been
anything
originally
sound
in
that
proposition
i
had
at
least
missed
the
particular
kind
of
goodness
to
which
it
was
chargeable
i
wanted
i
absurdly
wanted
just
then
to
collect
my
arrears
of
privilege
and
consideration
in
terms
of
hardwood
furniture
and
afternoon
teakettles
in
graceful
feminine
leisure
all
the
traditional
sanctity
and
enthronement
of
women
for
which
i
had
paid
with
my
body
with
maternal
anxieties
and
wifely
submission
what
glimmered
on
my
horizon
was
the
realization
that
it
was
not
in
such
appreciable
coin
the
debt
was
paid
the
beginning
of
knowledge
that
seldom
except
by
accident
is
it
paid
at
all
what
i
learned
from
pauline
was
that
most
of
it
came
by
way
of
the
bargain
counter
not
even
the
shining
destiny
was
due
to
arrive
merely
by
reason
of
your
own
private
conviction
of
being
fit
but
demanded
something
to
be
laid
down
for
it
though
if
you
had
named
the
whole
price
to
me
at
that
juncture
i
should
have
refused
to
pay
besides
all
this
the
most
memorable
thing
that
came
of
my
visit
to
pauline
was
that
i
went
to
the
theatre
it
was
henry
suggestion
he
thought
i
wanted
cheering
pauline
was
not
going
out
much
that
season
and
her
reluctance
to
claim
my
attention
in
the
face
of
my
bereavement
to
her
own
approaching
event
threw
at
times
a
shadow
of
constraint
on
our
quiet
evenings
henry
had
fallen
into
a
way
of
taking
me
out
for
timid
and
higglestonian
glimpses
of
the
night
sights
of
the
city
but
i
am
not
sure
it
was
the
obligation
of
hospitality
which
led
him
to
propose
the
theatre
i
recall
that
he
displayed
a
particular
knowingness
about
what
he
styled
the
attractions
what
surprised
me
most
was
that
i
discovered
no
qualms
in
myself
over
a
proceeding
so
at
variance
with
my
bringing
up
and
the
piece
a
broad
comedy
of
henry
selection
made
no
particular
impression
on
me
other
than
the
singular
one
of
having
known
a
great
deal
about
it
before
my
criticism
of
the
acting
brought
pauline
around
with
a
swing
from
the
city
cousin
attitude
in
which
she
had
initiated
the
experience
for
me
to
one
æsthetically
sympathetic
the
things
men
choose
my
dear
and
to
anybody
who
has
been
saturated
in
shakespeare
as
you
have
you
really
must
see
modjeska
it
will
be
an
inspiration
to
you
henry
you
must
take
her
to
see
modjeska
i
had
not
yet
made
up
my
mind
as
to
whether
i
liked
henry
mills
but
i
was
willing
to
go
and
see
modjeska
with
him
we
had
orchestra
seats
and
pauline
insisted
on
my
wearing
her
black
silk
wrap
on
the
way
henry
told
me
a
great
deal
about
madam
modjeska
with
that
same
air
of
knowingness
which
fitted
so
oddly
with
his
assumption
of
the
model
husband
i
had
accustomed
myself
to
think
of
henry
as
an
attorney
which
in
taylorville
meant
a
man
who
could
be
trusted
with
the
administration
of
widows
property
and
fourth
of
july
orations
henry
it
transpired
was
a
sort
of
junior
partner
in
one
of
those
city
firms
whose
concern
is
not
with
people
who
have
broken
the
law
but
with
those
who
are
desirous
to
sail
as
close
to
the
wind
as
possible
without
breaking
it
they
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
stock
companies
in
connection
with
which
henry
had
found
some
personal
advantage
he
always
referred
to
it
as
our
office
so
that
i
am
in
doubt
still
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
his
connection
with
it
its
only
relation
to
his
private
life
was
to
lead
to
his
habitually
appearing
in
what
is
known
as
a
business
suit
and
an
air
of
shrewd
reliability
if
in
the
beginning
he
had
any
notions
of
his
own
as
to
what
a
husband
ought
to
be
he
had
discarded
them
in
favour
of
pauline
and
if
as
early
as
that
he
had
devised
any
system
of
paying
himself
off
for
his
complicity
in
her
ideals
i
did
discover
it
i
saw
modjeska
with
henry
in
romeo
and
juliet
and
afterward
stole
away
to
a
matinée
by
myself
and
saw
her
as
rosalind
i
do
not
know
now
if
she
was
the
great
artist
she
seemed
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
seen
her
but
she
sufficed
i
had
no
words
in
which
to
express
my
extraordinary
sense
of
possession
in
her
the
profound
excluding
intimacy
of
her
art
long
after
henry
mills
had
gone
to
his
connubial
pillow
i
remained
walking
up
and
down
in
my
room
in
a
state
of
intense
inarticulate
excitement
i
did
not
think
concretely
of
the
stage
nor
of
acting
what
i
had
news
of
was
a
country
of
large
impulses
and
satisfying
movement
i
felt
myself
strong
had
i
but
known
the
way
to
set
out
for
it
when
i
found
sleep
at
last
it
was
to
dream
not
of
the
theatre
but
of
helmeth
garrett
i
was
made
aware
of
him
first
by
a
sense
of
fulness
about
my
heart
and
then
i
came
upon
him
looking
as
he
had
looked
last
in
the
willesden
woods
writing
at
a
table
a
pale
blur
about
him
of
the
causeless
light
of
dreams
i
recognized
the
carpet
underfoot
as
a
favourite
taylorvillian
selection
but
overhead
red
boughs
of
sycamore
and
oak
depended
through
the
atmosphere
i
stood
and
read
over
his
shoulder
what
he
wrote
and
though
the
words
escaped
me
the
meaning
of
them
put
all
straight
between
us
he
turned
as
he
wrote
and
looked
at
me
with
a
look
that
set
us
back
in
the
wrapt
intimacy
of
the
flaming
forest
somehow
we
had
got
there
and
found
it
softly
dark
in
the
interval
between
my
dream
and
morning
that
kiss
which
had
been
the
source
of
so
much
secret
blame
and
secret
exultation
was
somehow
accounted
for
it
was
a
waif
out
of
the
country
of
rosalind
and
juliet
the
sense
of
a
vital
readjustment
remained
with
me
all
that
day
there
had
been
after
all
in
the
common
phrase
something
between
us
but
i
explained
the
recrudescence
of
memory
on
the
basis
that
it
was
from
helmeth
garrett
that
i
had
first
heard
of
chicago
and
modjeska
i
came
back
to
higgleston
reasonably
well
with
some
fine
points
of
achievement
twinkling
ahead
of
me
to
have
my
sense
of
direction
put
all
at
fault
by
the
trivial
circumstance
of
tommy
having
papered
the
living
room
the
walls
when
we
took
the
house
had
been
finished
hard
and
white
much
in
need
of
renewing
from
the
expense
of
which
our
immediate
plunge
into
the
cares
of
a
family
had
prevented
us
casting
about
for
any
way
of
ridding
it
against
my
return
of
the
sadness
of
association
tommy
had
hit
upon
the
idea
of
papering
the
room
himself
in
the
evenings
after
closing
hours
and
by
way
of
keeping
it
a
pleasant
surprise
had
chosen
the
paper
to
his
own
taste
any
one
who
kept
house
in
the
early
will
recall
a
type
of
paper
then
in
vogue
of
large
unintelligent
arabesques
of
a
liverish
bronzy
hue
parting
at
regular
intervals
upon
neapolitan
landscapes
of
pronounced
pinks
and
blues
tommy
landscapes
achieved
the
added
atrocity
of
having
japanese
ladies
walking
about
in
them
and
though
the
room
wanted
lighting
the
paper
was
very
dark
it
must
have
cost
him
something
too
from
the
amount
of
his
salary
which
he
had
remitted
for
my
hospital
expenses
he
could
hardly
have
left
himself
money
to
pay
for
his
meals
at
higgleston
one
doubtful
restaurant
the
appearance
of
the
kitchen
indeed
suggested
that
he
had
made
most
of
them
on
crackers
and
tinned
ham
i
was
glad
to
have
discovered
this
before
i
said
to
him
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
for
him
to
send
me
the
money
and
let
me
select
the
paper
in
chicago
what
leaped
upon
me
as
he
waved
the
lamp
about
to
show
me
how
cleverly
he
had
matched
the
borders
was
the
surprising
the
confounding
certainty
that
after
all
our
shared
sorrow
and
anxiety
we
had
in
the
least
come
together
i
had
lived
in
the
house
with
him
for
two
years
had
borne
him
a
child
and
lost
it
and
he
had
chosen
this
moment
of
heartrending
return
to
give
me
to
understand
that
he
even
know
what
i
might
like
in
the
way
of
wall
papers
i
suppose
all
this
time
when
the
surface
of
my
attention
was
taken
up
with
the
baby
i
had
been
making
unconscious
estimates
of
my
husband
but
that
night
just
as
we
had
come
from
the
station
the
moment
of
calculating
that
on
a
basis
of
necessary
economy
i
should
have
to
live
at
least
three
years
with
the
evidence
of
his
ineptitude
was
the
first
of
my
regarding
him
critically
as
the
instrument
of
my
destiny
and
i
had
primarily
selected
him
for
that
purpose
i
do
not
know
now
exactly
why
i
married
tommy
except
that
marriage
seemed
a
natural
sort
of
experience
and
i
had
taken
to
it
as
readily
as
though
it
had
been
something
to
eat
something
to
nourish
and
sustain
i
had
at
any
rate
thought
of
it
as
entangling
i
did
not
then
but
certainly
it
occurred
to
me
that
for
the
enlarged
standard
of
living
i
had
brought
home
with
me
a
man
of
tommy
taste
was
likely
to
prove
an
unsuitable
tool
slight
as
the
incident
of
the
wall
paper
was
it
served
to
check
my
dawning
interest
in
domesticity
and
set
my
hungering
mind
looking
elsewhere
for
sustenance
we
were
still
a
little
in
arrears
on
account
of
the
funeral
expenses
and
my
illness
and
no
more
improvements
were
to
be
thought
of
tommy
and
i
were
of
one
mind
in
that
we
had
the
common
taylorvillian
horror
of
debt
there
were
other
things
which
seemed
to
put
off
my
conquest
of
the
harmonious
environment
things
every
woman
who
has
lost
a
child
will
understand
starting
awake
at
night
to
the
remembered
cry
the
blessed
weight
upon
the
arm
that
failed
and
receded
before
returning
consciousness
i
recall
going
into
the
bedroom
once
where
a
shawl
had
been
dropped
on
the
pillow
like
so
like
and
the
memories
of
infinitesimal
neglects
that
began
to
show
now
preposterously
blamable
in
my
first
year
at
higgleston
i
had
been
rather
driven
apart
from
the
community
by
the
absorption
of
my
condition
and
the
intimation
that
instead
of
being
the
crown
of
life
it
merely
saved
itself
by
not
being
mentioned
now
in
my
desperate
need
of
the
social
function
i
began
to
imagine
for
want
of
any
other
likeness
between
us
a
community
of
lack
i
thought
of
higgleston
as
aching
for
life
as
i
ached
and
began
to
wonder
if
we
might
help
one
another
as
the
colder
weather
shut
me
more
into
the
haunted
rooms
tommy
thought
it
might
be
a
good
thing
if
i
took
an
interest
in
the
entertainment
which
the
of
which
he
was
a
fellow
was
undertaking
for
the
benefit
of
their
new
hall
as
the
sort
of
service
counted
on
from
the
wives
of
prominent
members
it
might
also
be
beneficial
to
trade
on
this
understanding
i
did
take
an
interest
with
the
result
that
the
entertainment
was
an
immense
success
it
led
naturally
to
my
being
put
in
charge
of
the
annual
public
school
library
theatricals
and
a
little
later
to
my
being
connected
with
what
was
the
acute
dramatic
crisis
of
the
middle
west
there
should
be
a
great
many
people
still
who
remember
a
large
loose
melodrama
called
the
union
spy
or
the
confederate
spy
accordingly
as
it
was
performed
north
or
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
participated
in
by
the
country
at
large
a
sort
of
localized
passion
play
lifted
by
its
tremendous
personal
interest
free
of
all
theatrical
taint
there
was
a
captain
mcwhirter
who
went
about
with
the
scenery
and
accessories
casting
the
parts
and
conducting
rehearsals
sharing
the
profits
with
the
local
the
battle
scenes
were
invariably
executed
by
the
veterans
of
the
order
with
horrid
realism
effie
wrote
me
that
there
had
been
three
performances
in
taylorville
and
cousin
judd
had
been
to
every
one
of
them
with
the
reputation
i
had
acquired
in
higgleston
it
came
naturally
when
the
town
by
its
slighter
hold
on
the
event
achieved
a
single
performance
for
me
to
be
cast
for
the
principal
part
unhindered
by
any
convention
on
behalf
of
my
recent
mourning
rather
so
close
did
the
subject
lie
to
the
community
feeling
there
was
an
instinctive
sense
of
dramatic
propriety
in
my
sorrow
in
connection
with
the
anguish
of
women
one
can
imagine
such
a
sentiment
operating
in
the
choice
of
players
at
oberammergau
in
addition
to
my
acting
i
began
very
soon
to
take
a
large
share
of
the
responsibility
of
rehearsals
i
do
not
know
where
i
got
the
things
i
put
into
that
business
where
in
fact
does
gift
come
from
and
what
is
the
nature
of
it
i
found
myself
falling
back
on
my
studies
with
professor
winter
on
slight
amateurish
incidents
of
taylorville
on
my
brief
chicago
contact
even
to
account
to
higgleston
for
insights
certainties
that
they
would
not
have
accepted
without
some
such
obvious
backing
nevertheless
the
thing
was
there
the
aptitude
to
seize
and
carry
to
its
touching
its
fruitful
expression
the
awkward
eagerness
of
the
community
to
relive
its
most
moving
actualities
never
in
america
have
we
been
so
near
the
democratic
drama
in
the
final
performance
i
surprised
tommy
and
myself
with
my
success
most
of
all
i
surprised
captain
mcwhirter
he
was
arranging
a
production
of
the
spy
at
the
twin
towns
of
newton
and
canfield
about
two
hours
south
of
us
and
asked
me
to
go
down
there
for
him
and
attend
to
alternate
rehearsals
tommy
was
immensely
flattered
pleased
to
have
me
forget
my
melancholy
and
the
money
was
a
consideration
i
saw
the
captain
through
with
two
performances
in
each
town
and
three
at
waterbury
all
this
time
i
had
not
thought
of
the
stage
professionally
i
returned
to
tommy
and
the
wall
paper
after
the
final
performance
with
a
vague
sense
of
flatness
to
try
to
pull
together
out
of
unwilling
materials
the
stuff
of
a
satisfying
existence
suddenly
in
april
came
a
telegram
and
a
letter
from
captain
mcwhirter
at
kincade
to
say
that
on
the
eve
of
production
his
leading
lady
had
run
away
to
be
married
and
could
i
would
i
come
down
and
see
him
through
the
letter
contained
an
enclosure
for
travelling
expenses
and
a
substantial
offer
for
my
time
no
reasonable
objection
presenting
itself
i
went
down
to
him
by
monday
train
chapter
iv
on
the
morning
between
the
second
and
third
performance
of
the
spy
for
mcwhirter
never
let
the
people
off
with
less
than
three
if
he
could
help
it
as
i
was
sitting
in
the
dining
room
of
the
hotel
metropole
at
kincade
enjoying
the
sense
of
leisure
a
late
breakfast
afforded
i
saw
the
captain
making
his
way
toward
me
through
an
archipelago
of
whitish
island
upon
which
the
remains
of
innumerable
breakfasts
appeared
to
be
cast
away
without
hope
of
rescue
from
the
languid
waiters
steering
as
straight
a
course
as
was
compatible
with
a
conversation
kept
up
over
his
shoulder
with
a
man
who
for
a
certain
look
might
have
been
bred
for
the
priesthood
and
given
it
up
for
the
newspaper
business
it
was
a
type
and
manner
i
was
to
know
very
well
as
the
but
as
the
first
i
had
seen
of
that
species
i
failed
to
identify
it
what
i
did
remark
was
the
odd
mixture
of
condescension
and
importance
which
the
captain
managed
to
put
into
the
fact
of
being
caught
in
his
company
he
introduced
him
to
me
as
shamus
as
though
there
could
be
but
one
of
him
and
that
one
fully
accredited
and
explained
he
defined
him
further
after
some
remarks
on
the
performance
of
the
evening
before
in
a
key
which
seemed
to
sustain
the
evidence
of
name
in
favour
of
his
nationality
as
manager
of
the
shamrock
players
company
billed
for
the
first
of
the
week
in
kincade
it
turned
out
in
the
course
of
these
remarks
which
the
captain
delivered
with
a
kind
of
proprietary
air
in
us
that
he
called
himself
the
in
his
posters
had
a
proposition
to
make
to
me
he
put
it
with
an
admirable
mixture
of
compliment
and
depreciation
as
though
either
was
a
sort
of
stopcock
to
meet
a
too
reluctant
modesty
on
my
part
or
a
too
exorbitant
demand
for
payment
i
was
afterward
to
know
many
variations
of
this
singular
blend
and
to
acquaint
myself
definitely
how
far
it
is
safe
to
trust
it
in
either
direction
before
the
stop
was
turned
but
for
the
moment
i
was
under
the
impression
as
no
doubt
meant
i
should
be
that
a
thing
so
perfectly
asked
for
should
not
be
refused
what
he
asked
was
that
i
should
come
over
to
the
opera
house
where
the
rest
of
the
company
awaited
us
to
assist
at
a
rehearsal
in
the
part
left
open
by
the
illness
of
the
star
i
do
not
now
recall
if
the
manager
actually
made
me
an
offer
in
this
first
encounter
but
it
was
in
the
air
that
if
i
suited
the
part
and
the
part
suited
me
i
was
to
regard
myself
as
temporarily
engaged
in
miss
dean
place
so
naturally
had
the
occasion
come
about
that
i
can
not
remember
that
i
found
any
particular
difficulty
in
reconciling
myself
to
a
possible
connection
with
the
professional
stage
there
had
been
no
church
of
my
denomination
at
higgleston
and
i
had
affiliated
with
one
made
up
of
the
remnants
of
two
or
three
other
houseless
sects
under
the
caption
of
the
united
congregations
and
there
was
nothing
in
its
somewhat
loosened
discipline
that
positively
forbade
the
theatre
in
my
work
with
mcwhirter
the
play
had
come
to
mean
so
much
the
intimate
expression
of
life
so
wove
itself
with
all
that
had
been
profound
and
heroic
in
the
experience
of
the
people
that
it
seemed
to
come
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
for
me
to
be
walking
out
between
the
captain
and
the
manager
toward
the
opera
house
too
must
have
beguiled
me
with
that
extraordinary
celtic
faculty
for
the
sympathetic
note
for
i
am
sure
i
received
the
impression
as
we
went
that
his
play
the
shamrock
meant
quite
as
much
to
the
irish
temperament
as
the
spy
could
mean
to
ohianna
the
manager
and
mcwhirter
had
crossed
one
another
trails
on
more
than
one
occasion
which
seemed
to
give
the
whole
affair
the
colour
of
neighbourliness
it
transpired
in
the
course
of
our
walk
that
laurine
dean
greatest
emotional
actress
it
was
called
her
that
had
been
taken
down
at
waterbury
with
bronchitis
and
the
cast
having
been
already
disarranged
by
an
earlier
defection
he
had
been
obliged
to
cancel
several
stands
and
put
in
at
kincade
to
wait
until
a
substitute
could
be
procured
from
louis
or
chicago
which
difficulty
was
happily
obviated
by
the
discovery
of
olivia
bettersworth
all
this
as
i
was
to
learn
later
was
not
so
near
the
truth
as
it
might
be
but
it
served
i
could
never
make
out
so
insistent
was
each
to
claim
the
credit
of
it
whether
it
was
or
mcwhirter
first
thought
of
offering
the
part
to
me
but
there
it
was
for
me
to
take
it
or
leave
it
as
i
was
so
inclined
our
own
performance
was
in
armory
hall
and
this
was
my
first
entrance
of
the
back
premises
of
a
proper
stage
i
recall
as
we
came
in
through
the
stage
door
having
no
feeling
about
it
all
but
an
odd
one
of
being
entirely
habituated
to
such
entrances
they
were
all
there
waiting
for
us
the
shamrocks
grouped
around
the
prompter
table
in
a
dimly
lit
dusty
space
with
a
half
conscious
staginess
even
in
their
informal
groupings
men
and
women
regarding
me
with
a
queer
mixture
of
coldness
and
ingratiation
i
had
time
to
take
that
in
and
an
impression
of
shoppy
smartness
before
manager
with
a
movement
like
the
shuffling
of
cards
drew
us
all
together
in
a
kind
of
general
introduction
and
commanded
the
rehearsal
to
begin
well
i
went
on
with
it
as
i
suppose
it
was
foregone
i
should
as
soon
as
i
had
smelled
the
dust
of
action
which
was
the
stale
and
musty
cloud
that
rolled
up
on
our
skirts
from
the
floor
and
shook
down
upon
our
shoulders
from
the
wings
too
unsophisticated
even
to
guess
at
the
situation
which
the
manager
air
of
genial
hurry
was
so
admirably
planned
to
cover
i
read
from
the
prompter
book
had
sketched
the
plot
to
me
on
the
way
over
and
did
my
utmost
to
keep
up
with
his
hasty
interpolations
of
the
business
i
was
feeling
horribly
amateurish
and
awkward
in
the
presence
of
these
folk
whom
i
took
always
far
too
seriously
and
suddenly
swamped
in
confusion
at
hearing
the
manager
call
out
to
me
from
the
orchestra
what
was
meant
for
instruction
in
an
utterly
unintelligible
professional
jargon
mcwhirter
through
some
notion
i
suppose
of
keeping
his
work
innocuously
amateurish
had
used
no
sort
of
staginess
and
the
phrase
froze
me
into
mortification
with
the
strain
of
attention
i
was
already
under
i
could
not
even
make
an
intelligent
guess
at
his
meaning
as
mistaking
my
hesitation
repeated
it
with
growing
peremptoriness
i
could
see
the
rest
of
the
cast
who
were
on
the
stage
with
me
aware
of
my
embarrassment
and
letting
the
situation
fall
with
a
kind
of
sulky
detachment
which
struck
me
then
and
still
as
vulgar
rather
than
cruel
suddenly
from
behind
me
a
voice
smooth
and
full
translated
the
clipped
jargon
into
ordinary
speech
i
had
not
time
as
i
moved
to
obey
it
for
so
much
as
a
grateful
glance
over
my
shoulder
but
i
knew
very
well
that
the
voice
had
come
from
a
young
woman
of
about
my
own
age
who
as
i
entered
at
the
beginning
of
the
rehearsal
had
been
sitting
in
the
wings
taking
in
my
introduction
with
the
gaze
of
a
tethered
cow
quiet
incurious
oblivious
of
the
tether
as
soon
as
i
was
free
from
the
first
act
i
got
around
to
her
thank
you
so
much
i
began
you
see
i
am
not
used
why
do
you
care
she
wondered
it
is
only
a
kind
of
slang
they
all
had
to
learn
it
once
i
could
see
that
she
sprang
from
my
own
class
taylorville
the
high
school
the
village
dressmaker
might
have
turned
her
out
that
moment
and
by
degrees
i
was
aware
that
she
was
beautiful
pale
tanned
complexion
thick
untaught
masses
of
brown
hair
and
pale
brown
eyes
of
a
profound
and
unfathomed
rurality
as
she
moved
across
the
stage
at
the
prompter
call
with
her
skirts
bunched
up
on
her
hip
with
a
safety
pin
out
of
the
dust
as
if
she
had
just
come
from
scrubbing
the
dairy
i
fairly
started
with
the
shock
of
her
bodily
perfection
and
her
extraordinary
manner
of
going
about
with
it
as
though
it
were
something
picked
up
in
passing
for
the
convenience
of
covering
it
provoked
me
to
the
same
sort
of
involuntary
exclamation
as
though
one
should
see
a
child
playing
with
a
rare
porcelain
by
contrast
she
seemed
to
bring
out
in
the
others
streaks
and
flashes
of
cheapness
of
the
stain
and
wear
of
unprofitable
use
she
came
to
me
again
at
the
end
of
her
scene
where
do
you
live
she
wished
to
know
i
can
come
around
with
you
and
coach
you
with
your
part
i
not
sure
i
hesitated
i
do
know
if
i
shall
go
on
with
it
she
took
me
again
with
her
slow
incurious
gaze
why
what
else
are
you
here
for
that
in
fact
appeared
to
be
view
of
it
and
though
i
went
through
the
form
of
taking
the
day
to
think
it
over
and
telegraph
to
tommy
i
did
finally
engage
myself
to
the
shamrock
company
for
the
term
of
miss
dean
illness
my
husband
made
no
objection
except
that
he
preferred
i
should
not
use
my
own
name
as
indeed
had
no
notion
of
my
doing
as
the
posters
and
programmes
stood
in
miss
name
already
we
had
from
thursday
to
monday
to
get
up
my
part
with
all
my
quickness
i
could
not
have
managed
it
except
for
the
alacrity
with
which
after
the
first
day
all
the
company
played
up
to
my
business
prompted
me
in
my
lines
and
assisted
in
my
there
was
if
i
had
but
known
it
a
reason
for
this
extra
helpfulness
which
remembering
the
way
the
ladies
of
the
united
congregations
had
pulled
and
hauled
about
the
easter
entertainment
went
far
with
me
toward
raising
the
estimate
of
professional
acting
among
the
blessed
privileges
several
members
of
the
cast
had
felt
themselves
entitled
to
miss
dean
place
for
the
manager
had
refused
to
pay
an
understudy
and
found
it
easier
to
concede
it
to
me
a
brilliant
society
woman
as
i
had
been
figured
to
them
i
suspected
mcwhirter
there
a
talented
amateur
who
would
return
to
privacy
and
trouble
the
profession
no
more
rather
than
to
one
who
might
be
expected
to
develop
tendencies
to
keep
what
she
had
got
moreover
they
had
played
to
small
houses
of
late
most
of
the
salaries
were
in
arrears
and
from
the
first
of
my
taking
hold
of
it
it
began
to
be
certain
that
the
piece
would
go
for
i
not
only
played
the
part
of
the
gay
melodramatic
irish
eileen
but
i
played
with
it
there
was
all
my
youth
in
it
the
youth
i
had
had
there
was
wild
ellen
mcgee
and
the
wet
pastures
and
the
woods
aflame
with
tommy
and
a
home
to
fall
back
upon
with
no
professional
standing
to
keep
with
no
bitterness
and
rancours
i
adventured
with
the
part
tossed
it
up
and
made
sport
of
it
played
it
as
a
stupendous
lark
the
rest
of
the
company
took
it
from
me
that
it
was
a
lark
and
were
as
solicitous
to
see
it
through
for
me
as
though
i
had
been
an
only
child
among
a
lot
of
maiden
aunts
and
i
did
not
know
of
course
that
this
charm
of
good
fellowship
was
based
more
directly
on
the
returns
than
on
the
community
of
art
incidentally
a
great
deal
that
went
on
in
my
behalf
threw
light
on
the
character
and
disposition
of
the
star
i
wore
my
fingers
off
hookin
up
confided
the
dresser
who
took
in
her
gowns
for
me
but
she
wo
let
out
an
inch
not
she
well
this
spell
pull
down
a
bit
that
one
comfort
cecelia
brune
made
me
up
she
was
the
youngest
member
of
the
company
and
that
she
was
distractingly
and
unnecessarily
pretty
did
obviate
the
certainty
that
in
milwaukee
where
she
was
born
she
had
been
known
as
cissy
brown
you
do
really
need
anything
but
a
little
colour
and
black
around
the
eyes
she
insisted
dean
is
a
sight
when
she
made
up
got
so
much
to
cover
i
bet
she
is
no
sicker
than
me
she
just
taken
the
slack
time
to
get
her
wrinkles
massaged
gee
if
i
had
a
face
like
hers
take
it
off
and
have
it
ironed
cecelia
i
may
remark
lived
for
her
prettiness
she
lived
by
it
she
had
a
speaking
part
of
half
a
dozen
lines
and
a
dance
in
the
village
green
act
and
her
mere
appearance
on
the
street
of
any
town
where
we
were
billed
was
good
for
two
solid
rows
clear
across
the
house
in
cecelia
opinion
this
was
the
quintessence
of
art
to
attract
males
and
keep
them
dangling
and
to
eke
out
her
personal
adornment
by
gifts
which
she
managed
to
extract
from
her
admirers
without
having
yet
paid
the
inestimable
price
for
them
married
woman
as
i
was
i
was
too
countrified
to
understand
that
inevitably
she
must
finally
pay
it
she
had
all
the
dewy
softness
of
look
that
one
reluctantly
disassociates
from
innocence
and
a
degree
of
cold
grubby
calculation
which
she
mistook
flaunted
about
in
fact
for
chastity
it
was
she
who
told
me
as
much
as
i
got
to
know
for
a
great
many
years
of
sarah
croyden
who
had
already
taken
me
with
the
fascination
of
her
gift
the
inordinate
curiosity
to
know
to
touch
and
to
prove
which
makes
me
still
the
victim
of
its
least
elusive
promise
and
the
dupe
of
any
poor
pretender
to
it
i
wanted
something
to
account
for
except
when
she
was
under
the
obsession
of
a
part
her
marked
inadequacy
to
her
perfect
exterior
for
the
rich
full
voice
that
caught
in
the
wind
of
her
genius
gripped
and
threatened
but
ran
through
her
ordinary
conversation
as
flaccid
as
a
velvet
ribbon
she
was
by
cecelia
account
the
daughter
of
a
baptist
elder
in
a
small
new
york
town
strictly
brought
up
i
could
measure
the
weals
of
the
strictness
upon
my
own
heart
and
had
run
away
with
an
actor
named
lawrence
after
one
wild
brief
encounter
when
had
been
playing
in
the
town
that
was
before
cecelia
time
and
she
had
no
report
of
the
said
lawrence
except
that
he
was
as
handsome
as
they
make
them
and
a
regular
rotter
she
ought
to
have
known
opined
cecelia
though
where
in
her
nineteen
years
she
could
have
acquired
the
groundwork
of
such
knowledge
was
more
than
i
could
guess
she
ought
to
have
known
what
she
was
up
against
by
his
bein
so
willing
to
marry
her
he
would
have
put
his
head
in
a
noose
like
that
without
he
had
hold
of
the
loose
end
of
it
himself
that
he
had
so
held
it
transpired
in
less
than
a
year
in
the
reappearance
of
a
former
wife
who
turned
up
at
his
lodging
one
night
to
wait
his
return
from
the
theatre
where
no
one
knew
by
what
diabolical
agency
lawrence
had
word
of
her
and
made
what
cecelia
called
a
get
away
what
passed
between
the
two
women
on
that
occasion
must
have
been
noteworthy
but
it
was
sunk
forever
under
sarah
unfathomable
rurality
who
of
his
class
was
a
very
decent
sort
had
been
so
little
able
to
bear
the
sight
of
beauty
in
distress
that
he
offered
the
poor
girl
an
unimportant
part
as
an
alternative
to
starvation
and
sarah
had
very
quickly
settled
what
was
to
become
of
her
by
developing
extraordinary
talent
i
think
no
one
of
us
at
that
time
quite
realized
how
good
she
was
cecelia
brune
i
know
did
not
even
think
her
beautiful
no
style
she
said
settling
her
corset
at
the
hips
and
fluffing
up
her
pompadour
with
my
comb
and
no
figgur
but
myself
i
seemed
to
see
her
the
mere
embodiment
of
a
gift
which
had
snatched
at
this
chance
encounter
with
an
actor
to
swing
into
opportunity
regardless
of
its
host
whenever
i
watched
her
acting
some
living
impulse
deep
within
me
reared
its
head
i
have
set
all
this
down
here
because
with
the
exception
of
manager
and
jimmy
vantine
the
comedian
who
was
objectionable
and
in
love
with
cecelia
these
two
women
were
all
i
ever
saw
again
of
the
shamrock
players
miss
dean
i
did
not
meet
on
this
occasion
for
though
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
before
i
had
time
to
tire
of
travel
and
new
towns
and
nightly
triumphs
she
wrote
she
would
return
to
her
work
it
fell
out
that
she
did
not
actually
return
until
i
was
well
on
my
way
home
i
thought
she
would
have
a
quick
recovery
when
she
found
out
what
a
sweep
you
been
makin
remarked
cecelia
that
was
all
the
comment
that
passed
on
the
occasion
if
made
no
motion
toward
making
me
a
permanent
member
of
his
company
there
were
reasons
for
it
that
i
understood
better
later
i
had
to
own
to
a
little
disappointment
that
nobody
came
to
the
station
to
see
me
off
except
cecelia
and
sarah
croyden
it
is
true
jimmy
vantine
was
there
but
he
left
us
in
no
doubt
that
he
only
came
because
cecelia
had
promised
to
spend
the
interval
between
their
train
and
my
own
in
his
company
he
fussed
about
with
my
luggage
in
order
to
get
me
off
as
quickly
as
possible
the
very
relation
of
the
shamrocks
to
what
was
for
me
the
community
of
art
had
never
struck
so
sourly
upon
me
as
at
the
casual
quality
of
their
i
remembered
noticing
that
morning
how
very
little
hair
there
was
on
the
top
of
jimmy
vantine
head
and
that
he
did
not
seem
to
me
quite
clean
i
found
myself
so
let
down
after
the
three
weeks
excitement
that
i
thought
it
necessary
at
springfield
where
i
changed
to
interpose
two
days
shopping
between
me
and
higgleston
among
other
things
i
bought
there
was
a
spirit
lamp
and
a
brass
teakettle
chapter
v
understand
that
up
to
this
time
i
had
not
yet
thought
of
the
stage
as
a
career
for
myself
i
had
yet
needed
it
i
had
not
then
realized
that
the
insight
and
passion
which
have
singled
me
out
among
women
of
my
profession
could
be
turned
to
render
the
mere
business
of
living
beautiful
and
fit
i
hardly
understand
it
now
why
should
people
pay
night
after
night
to
see
me
loving
achieving
suffering
in
a
way
they
would
think
of
undertaking
for
themselves
life
as
i
saw
it
was
sufficiently
dramatic
charged
wonderful
i
at
least
felt
at
home
in
the
great
moments
of
kings
the
tender
hours
of
poets
and
i
thought
of
my
participation
in
these
things
rendering
me
in
any
way
superior
to
higgleston
or
even
different
if
i
had
i
should
have
settled
there
in
the
first
place
if
i
had
glimpsed
even
at
exclusion
from
all
that
mattered
passionately
to
me
i
should
have
married
him
it
was
because
i
had
not
yet
begun
to
be
markedly
dissatisfied
with
either
of
them
that
i
presently
got
myself
the
reputation
of
having
trampled
both
tommy
and
higgleston
underfoot
i
must
ask
your
patience
for
a
little
until
i
show
you
how
wholly
i
offered
myself
to
them
both
and
how
completely
they
would
have
me
the
point
of
departure
was
of
course
that
i
did
accept
the
higglestonian
reading
of
married
obligations
to
mean
that
my
whole
time
was
to
be
taken
up
with
just
living
with
tommy
it
was
as
natural
and
in
view
of
the
scope
it
afforded
for
individual
development
a
more
convenient
arrangement
than
living
with
my
mother
but
not
a
whit
more
absorbing
i
could
anyway
think
of
just
living
as
an
end
and
accordingly
i
looked
about
for
a
more
spacious
occupation
i
thought
i
had
found
it
in
the
directing
of
that
submerged
spiritual
passion
which
i
had
felt
in
the
sustaining
drama
of
the
war
i
had
a
notion
there
might
be
a
vent
for
it
in
the
shape
of
a
permanent
dramatic
society
by
means
of
which
all
higgleston
and
i
with
them
could
escape
temporarily
from
its
commonness
into
the
heroic
movement
it
was
all
very
clear
in
my
own
mind
but
it
failed
utterly
in
communication
i
began
wrongly
in
the
first
place
by
asking
the
higgleston
ladies
to
tea
afternoon
tea
was
unheard
of
in
higgleston
and
i
had
forgotten
or
perhaps
i
had
never
learned
that
in
higgleston
you
could
do
anything
different
without
implying
dissatisfaction
with
things
as
they
were
you
were
likely
on
such
occasions
to
be
visited
by
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
place
was
good
enough
for
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
afternoon
tea
was
almost
as
unfamiliar
to
me
as
to
the
rest
of
them
but
i
had
read
english
novels
and
i
knew
how
it
ought
to
be
done
i
knew
for
instance
that
people
came
and
went
with
a
delightful
informality
and
had
tea
made
fresh
for
them
and
were
witty
or
portentous
as
the
occasion
demanded
my
invitations
read
from
four
to
five
and
the
higgleston
ladies
came
solidly
within
the
minute
and
departed
in
phalanxes
upon
the
stroke
of
five
they
all
wore
their
best
things
which
from
the
number
of
black
silks
included
and
black
kid
gloves
not
quite
pulled
on
at
the
finger
tips
gave
the
affair
almost
a
funereal
atmosphere
they
had
most
of
them
had
their
tea
with
their
midday
meal
and
dinkelspiel
said
openly
that
she
did
approve
of
eating
between
meals
they
sat
about
the
room
against
the
wall
and
fairly
hypnotized
me
into
getting
up
and
passing
things
which
i
knew
was
not
the
way
tea
should
be
served
in
higgleston
the
only
occasion
when
things
were
handed
about
were
church
sociables
and
the
like
when
the
number
of
guests
precluded
the
possibility
of
having
them
all
at
your
table
and
by
the
time
i
got
once
around
the
tea
was
cold
and
i
realized
how
thin
my
thin
bread
and
butter
and
chocolate
wafers
looked
in
respect
to
the
huge
soft
slabs
of
layer
cake
stiffened
by
frosting
and
filling
which
in
higgleston
went
by
the
name
of
light
refreshments
the
only
saving
incident
was
the
natural
way
in
which
ross
our
attorney
wife
who
visited
east
every
summer
and
knew
how
things
were
done
asked
for
two
lumps
please
and
came
back
a
second
time
for
bread
and
butter
i
think
they
were
all
tremendously
pleased
to
be
asked
though
they
did
intend
to
commit
themselves
to
the
innovation
by
appearing
to
have
a
good
time
and
that
was
the
occasion
i
chose
for
broaching
my
great
subject
without
i
am
afraid
in
the
least
grasping
their
incapacity
to
share
in
my
joyous
discovery
of
the
world
of
art
which
i
so
generously
held
out
to
them
it
had
been
possible
to
keep
my
professional
adventure
from
the
townspeople
nor
had
i
attempted
it
what
i
really
felt
was
that
we
were
to
be
congratulated
as
a
community
in
having
one
among
us
privileged
to
experience
it
and
i
honestly
think
i
should
have
felt
so
of
any
one
to
whom
the
adventure
had
befallen
but
i
suspect
i
must
have
given
the
impression
of
rather
flaunting
it
in
their
faces
i
put
my
new
project
on
the
ground
that
though
we
were
dissevered
by
our
situation
there
was
no
occasion
for
our
being
out
of
touch
with
the
world
of
emotion
not
at
least
so
long
as
we
had
admission
to
it
through
the
drama
and
it
was
in
me
to
imagine
that
the
world
i
prefigured
to
them
under
those
terms
was
one
by
their
standards
never
to
be
kept
sufficiently
at
a
distance
miller
put
the
case
for
most
of
them
with
the
suggestion
thrown
out
guardedly
that
she
did
know
as
she
held
with
plays
for
church
members
she
was
a
large
tasteless
woman
whose
husband
kept
the
lumber
yard
and
derived
from
it
an
extensive
air
of
being
in
touch
with
the
world
occupations
and
i
do
know
she
went
on
relentlessly
that
i
ever
see
any
good
come
of
play
acting
to
them
that
practise
it
ross
determined
to
live
up
to
her
two
lumps
came
forward
gallantly
with
oh
but
miller
when
our
dear
bettersworth
that
what
i
was
thinking
of
miller
put
it
over
her
well
for
my
part
declared
dinkelspiel
with
the
air
of
not
caring
who
knew
it
i
do
want
my
girls
to
sell
tickets
or
anything
it
makes
too
forward
harvey
whose
husband
was
in
hardware
began
to
tell
discursively
about
a
perfectly
lovely
entertainment
they
had
had
in
newton
centre
for
the
missionary
society
which
miller
took
exception
to
on
the
ground
of
its
frivolity
i
do
know
she
maintained
if
the
lord
work
ai
hindered
by
them
sort
of
comicalities
as
much
as
it
helped
i
am
not
sure
where
this
discussion
might
have
landed
us
if
the
general
attention
had
not
been
distracted
just
then
by
my
husband
an
hour
before
his
time
coming
through
the
front
gate
and
up
the
walk
he
had
evidently
forgotten
my
tea
party
for
he
came
straight
to
me
and
backed
away
precipitately
through
the
portières
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
assembled
ladies
sitting
about
the
wall
it
was
not
that
which
disturbed
us
any
higgleston
male
would
have
done
the
same
but
it
was
plain
in
the
brief
glimpse
we
had
of
him
that
he
looked
white
and
stricken
a
little
later
we
heard
him
in
the
back
of
the
house
making
ambiguous
noises
such
as
not
one
of
my
guests
could
fail
to
understand
as
the
precursor
of
a
domestic
crisis
i
could
see
the
little
flutter
of
uneasiness
which
passed
over
them
between
their
sense
of
its
demanding
my
immediate
attention
and
the
fear
of
leaving
before
the
expressed
time
fortunately
the
stroke
of
five
released
them
the
door
was
hardly
shut
on
the
last
silk
skirt
when
i
ran
out
and
found
him
staring
out
of
the
kitchen
window
well
i
questioned
i
thought
they
would
never
go
he
protested
come
in
here
he
led
the
way
to
the
living
room
as
if
somehow
he
found
it
more
appropriate
to
the
gravity
of
what
he
had
to
impart
and
yet
failed
to
make
a
beginning
with
his
news
he
shut
the
door
and
leaned
against
it
with
his
hands
behind
him
for
support
has
anything
happened
happened
oh
i
do
know
i
lost
my
job
lost
burton
brothers
i
was
all
at
sea
he
nodded
they
closing
out
the
manager
in
town
he
told
us
by
degrees
i
got
it
out
of
him
burton
brothers
thought
they
saw
hard
times
ahead
they
were
closing
out
a
number
of
their
smaller
establishments
centering
everything
on
their
chicago
house
suddenly
my
thought
leaped
up
but
could
they
give
you
something
there
in
chicago
i
was
dizzy
for
a
moment
with
the
wild
hope
of
it
never
to
live
in
higgleston
any
more
but
tommy
cut
me
short
they
men
who
have
been
with
them
longer
than
i
have
to
provide
for
i
asked
oh
well
no
matter
the
world
is
full
of
jobs
looking
for
one
appealed
to
me
in
the
light
of
an
adventure
but
because
i
saw
how
pale
he
was
i
went
to
him
and
began
to
kiss
him
softly
by
the
way
he
yielded
himself
to
me
i
grasped
a
little
of
his
lost
and
rudderless
condition
once
he
found
himself
outside
the
limits
of
a
salaried
employment
i
began
to
question
him
again
as
the
best
way
of
getting
the
extent
of
our
disaster
before
us
what
does
rathbone
say
rathbone
was
our
working
tailor
a
thin
elderly
peering
man
of
a
sort
you
could
scarcely
think
of
as
having
any
existence
apart
from
his
shop
he
used
to
come
sidling
down
the
street
to
it
and
settle
himself
among
his
implements
with
the
air
of
a
brooding
hen
taking
to
her
nest
the
sound
of
his
machine
was
a
contented
clucking
he
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
they
better
fixed
than
we
are
tommy
added
this
as
an
afterthought
as
likely
to
affect
the
tailor
attitude
when
he
came
to
himself
they
were
old
rathbone
and
his
daughter
one
of
those
conspicuously
blond
and
women
who
seem
to
take
to
the
dressmaking
and
millinery
trades
by
instinct
as
she
got
herself
up
on
sunday
in
her
smart
tailoring
with
a
hat
from
the
city
and
her
hair
amazingly
pompadoured
she
was
to
some
of
the
men
who
came
to
our
church
very
much
what
the
brass
teakettle
was
to
me
a
touch
of
the
unattainable
but
not
unappreciated
elegancies
of
life
tommy
admired
her
immensely
and
was
disappointed
that
i
did
not
have
her
at
the
house
oftener
they
got
her
business
to
fall
back
on
tommy
suggested
now
with
an
approach
to
envy
he
had
never
seen
miss
rathbone
as
i
had
professionally
going
about
with
her
protuberant
bosom
stuck
full
of
pins
a
tape
line
draped
about
her
collarless
neck
and
her
skirt
and
belt
never
quite
together
in
the
back
so
he
thought
of
her
establishment
as
a
kind
of
stay
in
affliction
and
i
have
the
stage
i
flourished
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
thought
of
it
as
an
expedient
but
i
glanced
away
from
the
thought
in
passing
for
to
say
the
truth
i
did
in
the
least
know
how
to
go
about
getting
a
living
by
it
i
creamed
some
chipped
beef
for
tommy
supper
a
dish
he
was
particularly
fond
of
and
opened
a
jar
of
quince
marmalade
and
all
the
time
i
was
stirring
something
or
setting
the
table
i
had
my
arms
around
him
trying
to
prop
him
against
what
i
did
not
feel
so
much
terrifying
as
exciting
we
talked
a
little
about
his
getting
his
old
place
back
in
taylorville
and
just
as
we
were
clearing
away
the
supper
things
we
saw
miss
rathbone
with
her
father
tucked
under
her
arm
pass
the
square
of
light
raying
out
into
the
spring
dusk
from
our
window
and
a
moment
later
they
knocked
at
our
door
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
i
felt
bound
to
like
miss
rathbone
for
that
she
took
such
care
of
her
father
she
did
everything
for
him
it
was
said
even
to
making
up
his
mind
for
him
and
this
evening
by
the
flare
of
the
lamp
tommy
held
up
to
welcome
them
it
was
clear
she
had
made
it
up
to
some
purpose
it
must
have
been
what
he
saw
in
her
face
that
made
my
husband
put
the
lamp
back
on
the
table
from
which
the
white
cloth
had
not
yet
been
removed
as
if
the
clearing
up
was
too
small
a
matter
to
consort
with
the
occasion
i
was
relieved
to
have
my
husband
take
charge
of
the
visit
especially
as
he
made
no
motion
to
invite
them
into
the
front
room
where
the
remains
of
the
bread
and
butter
and
the
chairs
against
the
wall
would
have
apprised
miss
rathbone
of
my
having
entertained
company
on
an
occasion
to
which
she
had
not
been
invited
it
was
part
of
tommy
sense
of
social
obligation
that
we
ought
never
to
neglect
rathbone
whom
though
his
connection
with
the
business
was
as
slight
as
my
husband
he
insisted
on
regarding
as
in
some
sort
a
partner
so
we
sat
down
rather
stiffly
about
the
table
still
shrouded
in
its
white
cloth
as
though
upon
it
were
about
to
be
laid
out
the
dead
enterprise
of
burton
brothers
and
looked
all
of
us
i
think
a
little
pleased
to
find
ourselves
in
so
grave
a
situation
miss
rathbone
who
had
always
a
great
many
accessories
to
her
toilet
bags
and
handkerchiefs
and
scarves
and
things
laid
them
on
the
table
as
though
they
were
a
kind
of
insignia
of
office
and
made
a
poor
pretence
to
keep
up
with
me
the
proper
feminine
detachment
from
the
business
which
had
brought
them
there
we
neither
of
us
miss
rathbone
and
i
had
the
least
idea
what
the
other
might
be
thinking
about
or
presumably
interested
in
though
i
think
she
made
the
more
gallant
effort
to
pretend
that
she
did
on
this
evening
i
could
see
that
she
was
full
of
the
project
for
which
she
had
primed
her
father
and
was
nervously
anxious
lest
he
should
go
off
at
the
right
moment
or
with
the
proper
pyrotechnic
i
remember
the
talk
that
went
on
at
first
because
it
was
so
much
in
the
way
of
doing
business
in
higgleston
and
impressed
me
even
then
with
its
factitious
shrewdness
based
very
simply
on
the
supposition
that
capitalists
it
was
under
that
caption
that
burton
brothers
figured
never
meant
what
they
said
capitalists
were
always
talking
of
hard
times
it
was
part
of
their
deep
laid
perspicacity
burton
brothers
wished
to
sell
out
the
business
was
it
reasonable
to
suppose
they
would
think
it
good
enough
to
sell
and
not
good
enough
to
go
on
with
father
thinks
said
miss
rathbone
and
i
am
sure
he
had
done
so
dutifully
at
her
instigation
that
they
could
ask
no
great
price
after
talking
about
hard
times
the
way
they
have
it
was
not
in
keeping
with
what
was
thought
to
be
woman
place
that
she
should
go
on
to
the
completed
suggestion
in
fact
so
far
as
i
remember
it
never
was
completed
but
was
talked
around
and
about
as
if
by
indirection
we
could
lessen
the
temerity
of
the
proposal
that
old
rathbone
and
tommy
should
buy
out
the
shop
on
such
favorable
terms
as
burton
brothers
in
view
of
their
own
statement
of
its
depreciation
could
fail
to
make
you
could
live
over
the
store
miss
rathbone
let
fall
into
the
widening
rings
of
silence
that
followed
her
first
suggestion
your
rent
would
be
cheaper
and
it
would
come
into
the
business
i
felt
that
she
made
it
too
plain
that
the
chief
objection
that
my
husband
could
have
was
the
lack
of
money
for
the
initial
adventure
but
because
i
realized
that
much
of
my
instinctive
resistance
to
a
plan
that
tied
him
to
higgleston
as
to
a
stake
was
due
to
her
having
originated
it
i
kept
it
to
myself
i
had
a
hundred
inarticulate
objections
chief
of
which
was
that
i
could
see
how
any
plan
that
was
acceptable
to
the
rathbones
could
get
me
on
toward
the
shining
destiny
but
when
you
remember
that
i
had
yet
been
able
to
put
that
concretely
to
myself
you
will
see
how
impossible
it
was
that
i
should
have
put
it
to
my
husband
in
the
end
tommy
was
talked
over
i
believe
the
consideration
of
going
on
in
the
same
place
and
under
the
same
circumstances
without
the
terrifying
dislocation
of
looking
for
a
job
had
more
to
do
with
it
than
miss
rathbone
calculation
of
the
profits
we
wrote
home
for
the
money
effie
wrote
back
that
everything
of
mother
was
involved
in
the
stationery
business
which
was
still
on
the
doubtful
side
of
prosperity
but
tommy
father
let
us
have
three
hundred
dollars
the
necessity
of
readjusting
our
way
of
life
to
tommy
new
status
of
proprietor
and
moving
in
over
the
store
kept
my
plans
for
the
dramatic
exploitation
of
higgleston
in
abeyance
it
seemed
however
by
as
much
as
i
was
now
bound
up
with
the
interest
of
the
community
to
put
me
on
a
better
footing
for
beginning
it
and
on
decoration
day
walking
in
the
cemetery
under
the
bright
boughs
between
the
flowery
mounds
the
gift
stirred
in
me
played
upon
by
this
touching
dramatization
of
common
human
pain
and
loss
i
recalled
that
it
was
just
such
solemn
festivals
of
the
people
that
i
had
had
in
mind
to
lay
hold
on
and
make
the
medium
of
a
profounder
appreciation
and
the
next
one
about
to
present
itself
as
an
occasion
was
the
fourth
of
july
i
detached
myself
from
tommy
long
enough
to
make
my
way
around
to
two
or
three
of
the
ladies
who
usually
served
on
the
committee
we
ought
to
have
a
meeting
soon
now
i
suggested
it
will
take
all
of
a
month
to
get
the
children
ready
that
what
we
thought
agreed
miller
heavily
they
was
to
our
house
thursday
she
went
on
to
tell
me
who
was
to
read
the
declaration
and
who
deliver
the
oration
but
i
protested
that
exactly
what
they
had
every
fourth
these
twenty
years
well
i
guess
said
harvey
if
higgleston
people
want
that
kind
of
a
celebration
they
a
right
to
have
it
i
guess
they
have
miller
agreed
with
her
they
had
always
rather
held
it
out
against
me
at
higgleston
that
i
had
never
taken
the
village
squabbles
seriously
that
i
was
reconciled
too
quickly
for
a
proper
sense
of
their
proportions
and
they
must
have
reckoned
without
this
quality
in
me
now
for
i
was
so
far
from
realizing
the
deliberateness
of
the
slight
that
i
thought
i
would
go
around
on
the
way
home
and
see
our
minister
perhaps
he
could
do
something
it
appeared
simply
ridiculous
that
higgleston
should
have
the
newest
of
this
sort
of
thing
when
it
was
there
for
the
asking
i
found
him
raking
the
garden
in
his
third
best
suit
and
the
impossible
sort
of
hat
affected
by
professional
men
in
their
more
human
occasions
the
moment
i
flashed
out
at
him
with
my
question
about
the
committee
he
fell
at
once
into
a
manner
of
ministerial
equivocation
the
air
of
being
man
enough
to
know
he
was
doing
a
mean
thing
without
being
man
enough
to
avoid
doing
it
er
yes
he
believed
there
had
been
a
meeting
he
had
realized
that
i
was
expecting
to
be
notified
i
was
a
regular
member
was
i
no
i
admitted
but
last
year
the
intention
of
the
slight
began
to
dawn
on
me
you
see
the
programme
is
usually
made
up
from
the
children
of
the
united
sunday
schools
i
know
of
course
but
what
has
that
he
did
know
how
mean
it
was
i
could
see
by
the
dexterity
with
which
he
delivered
the
blow
a
good
many
of
the
mothers
thought
they
rather
not
have
them
exposed
to
er
professional
methods
as
an
afterthought
he
tried
to
give
it
the
cast
of
a
priestly
remonstrance
which
he
must
have
seen
did
in
the
least
impose
on
me
i
suppose
it
was
the
fear
of
how
i
might
put
it
to
one
of
his
best
paying
parishioners
that
led
him
to
go
around
to
the
store
the
next
morning
and
make
matters
worse
by
explaining
to
tommy
that
though
the
children
were
to
be
contaminated
by
my
professionalism
it
could
probably
be
arranged
for
me
to
recite
something
to
do
tommy
justice
he
was
as
mad
as
a
hatter
being
so
much
nearer
to
himself
i
suppose
my
husband
could
better
understand
the
mean
envy
of
my
larger
opportunity
but
his
obduracy
in
maintaining
that
i
had
been
offended
led
to
the
only
real
initiative
he
ever
showed
in
all
the
time
i
was
married
to
him
i
just
like
to
them
he
kept
sputtering
all
at
once
he
cheered
up
with
a
snort
show
them
he
was
very
busy
all
the
evening
with
letters
which
he
went
out
on
purpose
to
post
with
the
result
that
when
a
few
days
later
he
made
his
contribution
to
the
fireworks
fund
he
made
it
a
little
larger
as
became
a
live
business
man
on
the
ground
that
he
would
be
able
to
participate
as
his
wife
had
accepted
an
invitation
to
take
charge
of
the
programme
at
newton
centre
newton
centre
was
ten
miles
away
and
though
i
could
do
much
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
rehearsals
i
managed
to
make
the
announcement
of
it
in
the
county
paper
convey
to
them
that
what
they
had
missed
was
quite
to
be
sicklied
over
with
miller
asseveration
of
a
notable
want
of
moral
particularity
at
newton
centre
the
very
first
time
i
went
out
to
a
social
thereafter
it
was
made
plain
to
me
that
if
i
wanted
to
take
up
the
annual
library
entertainment
it
was
open
to
me
and
i
always
will
say
miller
conceded
that
there
nobody
can
make
your
children
seem
such
a
credit
to
you
as
mrs
bettersworth
it
a
regular
talent
you
have
harvey
backed
her
up
like
a
person
in
the
bible
this
scriptural
reference
came
in
so
aptly
that
i
could
see
several
ladies
nodding
complacently
ross
sailed
quite
over
them
and
landed
on
the
topmost
peak
of
approbation
i
always
believed
she
asserted
that
a
christian
woman
on
the
stage
would
have
an
uplifting
influence
but
by
this
time
my
ambition
had
slacked
under
the
summer
heat
and
the
steady
cluck
of
old
rathbone
machine
and
the
mixed
smell
of
damp
woollen
under
the
iron
and
creosote
shingle
stains
there
had
been
no
loss
of
social
standing
in
our
living
over
the
store
such
readjustments
in
higgleston
went
by
the
name
of
bettering
yourself
and
were
commendable
but
somehow
i
could
never
ask
ladies
to
tea
when
the
only
entrance
was
by
way
of
a
men
furnishing
store
the
four
rooms
opening
into
one
another
so
that
there
was
no
way
of
getting
from
the
kitchen
to
the
parlour
except
through
the
bedroom
i
found
quite
hopeless
as
a
means
of
expressing
my
relation
to
all
that
appealed
to
me
as
inspiring
dazzling
because
i
could
not
go
out
without
making
a
street
toilet
i
went
out
too
little
and
suffered
from
want
of
tone
and
suddenly
along
in
september
came
a
letter
from
offering
me
a
place
in
his
company
and
a
note
from
sarah
begging
me
to
accept
it
if
up
to
that
time
i
had
not
thought
of
the
stage
as
a
career
now
at
the
suggestion
the
desire
of
it
ravened
in
me
like
a
flame
chapter
vi
and
you
never
seem
to
think
i
might
not
my
wife
to
go
on
the
stage
i
do
not
know
what
unhappy
imp
prompted
tommy
to
take
that
tone
with
me
but
whenever
i
try
to
fix
upon
the
point
of
reprehensibleness
which
led
on
from
my
writing
to
that
i
would
join
him
in
ten
days
in
chicago
to
the
tragic
termination
of
my
marriage
i
found
myself
whirled
about
this
attitude
of
his
in
the
passionate
why
of
my
life
why
should
love
be
tied
to
particular
ways
of
doing
things
what
was
this
horror
of
human
obligation
that
made
it
necessary
since
tommy
and
i
were
so
innocently
fond
of
one
another
that
one
of
us
should
be
made
unhappy
by
it
why
should
it
be
so
accepted
on
all
sides
that
it
should
be
i
for
my
husband
feeling
was
but
a
single
item
in
the
total
of
social
prejudice
by
which
once
my
purpose
had
gone
abroad
by
way
of
the
rathbones
i
found
myself
driven
apart
from
the
community
interest
as
by
a
hostile
tide
across
which
higgleston
gazed
at
me
with
strange
begrudging
eyes
i
recall
how
the
men
looked
at
me
the
first
time
i
went
out
afterward
a
little
aslant
as
though
some
ineradicable
taint
of
impropriety
attached
in
their
minds
to
any
association
with
the
stage
whatever
attitude
tommy
finally
achieved
in
the
necessity
of
sustaining
the
situation
he
had
created
for
himself
by
his
backing
of
my
first
professional
venture
was
no
doubt
influenced
by
the
need
of
covering
his
hurt
at
realizing
through
my
own
wild
rush
to
embrace
the
present
opportunity
how
far
i
was
from
accepting
life
gracefully
at
his
hands
the
docile
creature
of
his
dreams
little
things
come
back
to
me
words
looks
sticks
and
straws
of
his
traditions
made
wreckage
by
the
wind
of
my
desire
which
my
resentment
at
his
implication
in
the
general
attitude
prevented
me
from
fully
estimating
my
mother
too
to
whom
i
wrote
my
decision
as
soon
as
i
had
arrived
at
it
in
a
long
letter
designed
to
convince
me
that
a
wife
chief
duty
and
becomingness
lay
in
seeing
that
nothing
of
her
lapped
over
the
bounds
prescribed
by
her
husband
capacity
contributed
to
the
exasperated
sense
i
had
of
having
every
step
toward
the
fulfilment
of
my
natural
gift
dragged
at
by
loving
hands
poor
mother
i
am
afraid
i
never
quite
realized
what
a
duckling
i
turned
out
to
her
nor
with
what
magnanimity
she
faced
it
but
i
suppose
you
think
you
are
doing
right
she
wrote
at
the
end
and
then
in
a
postscript
i
read
in
the
papers
there
is
a
church
in
new
york
that
gives
communion
to
actors
but
i
do
expect
you
will
get
as
far
as
that
it
was
finally
miss
rathbone
who
relieved
the
situation
by
pulling
tommy
over
to
a
consenting
frame
of
mind
in
consideration
of
the
neat
little
plumlet
she
extracted
from
it
for
herself
by
making
me
a
travelling
dress
in
three
days
she
brought
it
down
to
the
house
for
me
to
try
on
and
it
was
pathetic
to
see
the
way
my
husband
hung
upon
the
effect
she
made
for
him
of
turning
me
out
in
a
way
that
was
a
credit
to
them
both
you
see
she
seemed
to
be
saying
to
him
by
nothing
more
explicit
than
an
exclamation
full
of
pins
and
a
clever
way
of
squinting
at
the
hang
of
my
skirt
that
when
we
two
take
a
hand
at
the
affairs
of
the
great
world
we
can
come
up
to
the
best
of
them
and
all
the
time
i
could
hear
the
higgleston
ladies
drumming
up
trade
for
her
out
of
newton
centre
with
their
stylish
oh
very
she
makes
all
her
clothes
for
bettersworth
olivia
lattimore
the
actress
you
know
just
at
the
end
though
when
we
were
lying
in
bed
the
last
morning
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
again
lest
we
should
get
up
early
enough
to
catch
the
train
i
believe
if
tommy
had
risen
superior
to
his
traditional
objection
to
a
married
woman
having
interests
outside
her
home
and
claimed
me
by
some
strong
personal
need
of
his
own
i
should
have
answered
it
gladly
the
trouble
with
my
husband
need
of
me
was
that
it
left
too
much
over
but
of
course
he
reminded
me
at
the
station
you
can
give
it
up
any
minute
if
you
want
to
i
think
quite
to
the
last
he
hoped
i
would
rise
to
some
such
generous
pretence
and
come
back
to
him
but
we
neither
of
us
had
much
notion
of
the
nature
of
a
player
contract
i
had
arranged
to
stay
with
pauline
until
i
could
look
about
me
and
from
the
little
that
i
had
been
able
to
tell
her
of
my
affairs
i
could
see
she
was
in
a
flutter
what
to
think
of
me
during
the
five
days
i
was
in
her
house
i
watched
her
swing
through
a
whole
arc
of
possible
attitudes
to
settle
with
truly
remarkable
instinct
on
the
one
which
her
own
future
permitted
her
most
consistently
to
maintain
you
dear
ridiculous
child
she
hovered
over
the
point
with
indulgent
patronage
what
will
you
think
of
next
pauline
herself
was
going
through
a
phase
at
the
time
they
had
moved
out
to
a
detached
house
at
evanston
on
account
of
its
being
better
for
the
baby
and
there
was
a
visible
diminution
of
her
earlier
effect
of
housewifely
efficiency
in
view
of
henry
growing
prosperity
you
could
see
all
pauline
surfaces
like
a
tulip
bed
in
february
budding
toward
a
new
estimate
of
her
preciousness
in
terms
of
her
husband
income
when
she
took
me
by
the
shoulders
holding
me
off
from
her
to
give
play
to
the
pose
of
amused
affectionate
bewilderment
i
could
see
just
where
the
consciousness
of
a
more
acceptable
femininity
as
evinced
by
her
being
provided
with
a
cook
and
a
housemaid
prompted
her
to
this
gracious
glozing
of
my
not
being
in
quite
so
fortunate
a
case
i
was
to
be
the
wonder
the
sport
on
the
feminine
bush
dear
and
extenuated
made
adorably
not
to
feel
my
excluding
variation
an
attitude
not
uncommon
in
wives
of
husbands
toward
women
who
work
it
was
an
attitude
successfully
kept
up
by
pauline
mills
for
as
long
as
i
provided
her
the
occasion
just
at
first
i
suspect
i
rather
contributed
to
it
by
my
own
feeling
of
its
being
such
a
tremendous
adventure
for
me
olivia
lattimore
with
taylorville
hadley
pasture
and
the
mcgee
children
behind
me
to
be
going
on
the
stage
how
i
exulted
in
it
all
the
hall
bedroom
where
i
finally
settled
across
from
sarah
croyden
the
worry
of
rehearsals
the
baked
smell
of
the
streets
bored
through
by
the
raw
lake
winds
the
beckoning
night
lights
the
vestibule
of
doors
opening
on
the
solemn
splendour
of
the
world
at
the
rehearsals
i
met
cecelia
brune
if
anything
prettier
than
before
and
quite
perceptibly
harder
and
jimmy
vantine
still
in
love
with
her
still
with
his
bald
crown
not
quite
clean
and
the
same
objectionable
habit
of
sidling
about
fingering
one
dress
laying
hands
on
one
as
he
talked
i
met
manager
not
a
whit
altered
and
miss
laurine
dean
i
liked
and
i
did
like
her
she
drew
by
a
certain
warm
charm
of
personality
that
repelled
in
closer
quarters
by
its
odours
of
sickliness
there
was
a
quality
in
her
beauty
as
of
a
flower
kept
too
long
in
its
glass
not
so
much
withered
as
ready
to
fall
apart
she
had
small
appealing
hands
such
as
moved
one
to
take
them
up
and
handle
them
and
served
somehow
to
mitigate
a
subtle
impression
of
impropriety
conveyed
by
her
slight
sidewise
smile
she
was
probably
by
temperament
and
peevish
through
excessive
use
of
cigarettes
she
made
a
point
of
always
speaking
well
of
everybody
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
learned
that
no
sort
of
blame
was
so
deadly
as
her
commendation
such
a
beautiful
woman
miss
croyden
is
she
would
say
is
it
a
pity
about
her
nose
and
though
i
had
never
thought
of
sarah
nose
as
mitigating
against
her
perfection
i
found
myself
after
that
thinking
of
it
you
could
see
that
magnanimity
which
was
her
chosen
attitude
was
often
a
strain
to
her
i
do
not
think
she
had
any
gift
at
all
but
she
had
a
perception
of
it
that
had
enabled
her
to
produce
a
very
tolerable
imitation
of
acting
and
kept
her
in
a
covert
way
inordinately
jealous
of
the
gift
in
others
she
was
jealous
of
mine
it
was
not
all
at
once
i
discovered
it
in
the
beginning
because
i
never
detected
her
in
any
of
the
obvious
snatchings
of
lines
and
positions
that
went
on
at
rehearsals
but
even
making
a
stand
for
me
against
incursions
into
my
part
which
i
was
too
unaccustomed
to
forestall
i
thought
of
her
as
being
of
rather
better
strain
than
most
of
the
company
i
was
probably
the
only
member
of
it
unaware
of
her
deliberate
measures
not
to
permit
me
such
a
footing
as
might
lead
to
my
supplanting
her
with
manager
toward
whom
i
began
to
find
myself
in
what
for
me
was
an
interesting
and
charming
relation
it
was
a
relation
i
should
have
been
glad
to
maintain
with
any
member
of
the
company
but
it
was
only
who
found
himself
equal
to
it
i
was
full
and
effervescing
with
the
joy
of
creation
night
by
night
as
i
felt
the
working
of
the
living
organism
we
should
have
been
transmitting
supernal
energies
of
emotion
to
the
audience
who
by
the
very
communicating
act
became
a
part
of
us
i
felt
myself
also
warming
toward
my
fellow
players
i
was
so
charged
i
should
have
struck
a
spark
from
any
one
of
them
when
we
met
but
for
the
fact
that
by
degrees
i
discovered
that
they
presented
to
me
the
negative
pole
i
was
aware
of
such
communicating
fluid
between
particular
pairs
of
them
i
saw
it
spark
from
eye
to
eye
heard
it
break
in
voices
it
flashed
like
sheet
lightning
about
our
horizons
on
occasions
of
great
triumph
but
i
was
distinctly
alive
to
the
fact
that
the
medium
by
which
it
was
accomplished
was
turned
from
me
at
times
i
was
brushed
by
the
wing
of
a
suspicion
that
among
the
men
there
was
something
almost
predetermined
in
their
denial
of
what
was
for
me
the
sympathetic
creative
impulse
i
was
a
little
ashamed
for
them
of
the
gaucherie
of
withholding
what
seemed
so
important
to
our
common
success
and
yet
i
seemed
always
to
be
surprising
all
of
them
at
it
except
jimmy
vantine
and
the
manager
i
could
of
course
on
account
of
his
propensity
for
laying
hands
on
one
take
it
from
jimmy
but
between
and
me
it
ran
with
a
pleasant
profitable
warmth
i
was
conscious
always
of
acting
better
the
scenes
i
had
with
him
the
thrill
of
them
was
never
quite
broken
in
hours
i
felt
myself
sustained
by
it
for
one
thing
the
man
had
genuine
talent
and
i
think
besides
sarah
croyden
and
jimmy
vantine
no
one
else
in
the
company
had
very
much
jimmy
had
a
gift
besmeared
and
discredited
by
his
own
cheapness
but
had
a
real
flowing
genius
and
a
degree
of
personal
vitality
that
sketched
him
out
as
by
fire
from
the
flat
taylorville
types
i
had
known
we
used
to
talk
together
about
my
own
possibilities
and
i
had
many
helpful
hints
from
him
but
in
spite
of
this
friendliness
i
never
made
any
way
with
him
against
miss
dean
not
that
i
tried
but
by
degrees
i
found
that
suggestions
made
and
favours
asked
were
granted
or
accepted
on
the
basis
of
their
with
our
leading
lady
i
was
not
without
intimations
which
i
usually
disregarded
because
i
found
their
conclusions
impossible
to
maintain
that
she
even
triumphed
over
me
in
little
matters
too
inconsiderable
to
have
been
taken
into
account
except
on
the
understanding
that
we
were
pitted
in
a
deliberate
rivalry
i
was
hurt
and
amazed
at
times
to
discover
that
we
presented
this
aspect
to
the
rest
of
the
company
i
felt
that
i
was
being
judged
by
my
conduct
of
a
business
in
which
i
was
not
engaged
the
situation
however
had
not
developed
to
such
a
pitch
by
the
time
we
played
in
kincade
that
it
could
affect
my
pleasure
in
the
visit
tommy
paid
me
there
i
was
overjoyed
to
have
the
arms
of
my
own
man
about
me
again
i
was
proud
of
his
pride
in
my
success
as
and
pleased
to
have
him
and
sarah
pleased
with
one
another
i
thought
then
that
if
i
could
only
have
tommy
and
my
work
i
should
ask
no
more
of
destiny
i
do
not
now
see
why
i
could
but
i
like
best
to
think
of
him
as
he
seemed
to
me
then
wholesome
and
good
raised
by
his
joy
of
our
reunion
almost
to
my
excited
plane
generous
in
his
sharing
of
my
triumphs
it
seemed
for
the
moment
to
put
my
feet
quite
on
solid
ground
i
knew
at
last
where
i
was
it
was
about
a
month
after
this
that
i
began
to
find
myself
pitted
against
miss
dean
in
a
struggle
for
some
dimly
grasped
advantage
with
the
dice
cogged
against
me
i
saw
myself
in
the
general
estimate
convinced
of
handling
my
game
badly
and
could
form
no
guess
even
at
the
expected
moves
i
smarted
under
a
sense
that
manager
was
not
backing
up
the
friendliness
of
our
relations
and
i
remember
saying
to
sarah
croyden
once
that
i
suspected
miss
dean
was
using
her
sex
attraction
against
me
but
i
missed
the
point
of
sarah
slow
commiserating
smile
at
the
time
we
were
all
more
or
less
swamped
by
the
discomforts
of
our
wintry
flights
from
town
to
town
execrable
hotels
irregular
and
unsatisfying
meals
one
and
another
of
us
went
down
with
colds
and
finally
toward
the
end
of
february
i
was
taken
with
a
severe
neuralgia
it
reached
its
acutest
stage
the
first
night
we
played
at
louisville
i
had
hurried
home
from
the
theatre
the
moment
i
was
released
from
my
part
to
find
relief
from
it
in
rest
but
an
hour
or
two
later
still
suffering
and
discovering
that
i
had
taken
all
my
powders
i
decided
to
go
down
to
sarah
room
on
the
lower
floor
to
ask
for
some
that
i
knew
she
had
i
slipped
on
my
shoes
and
a
thick
gray
dressing
gown
and
taking
the
precaution
of
wrapping
my
head
in
a
shawl
against
the
draughty
halls
i
went
down
to
her
i
was
returning
with
the
box
of
powders
in
my
hand
when
i
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
door
lifting
carefully
on
the
latch
the
hotel
was
built
in
the
shape
of
a
capital
t
with
the
stair
halfway
of
the
stem
i
was
almost
at
the
foot
of
it
facing
the
cross
hall
that
gave
me
a
view
of
the
door
of
miss
room
and
i
saw
now
that
it
was
slightly
ajar
i
shrank
instinctively
into
the
shadow
of
the
recess
where
the
stair
began
for
i
was
unwilling
that
anybody
should
see
the
witch
i
looked
in
my
dressing
gown
and
shawl
in
the
interval
before
the
door
widened
i
heard
the
tick
of
a
clock
just
across
from
me
part
of
the
enamel
was
fallen
away
from
the
face
of
it
so
that
it
looked
as
if
eaten
upon
by
discreditable
sores
a
chandelier
holding
two
smoky
kerosene
lamps
hung
slightly
awry
at
the
crossing
of
the
t
and
cast
a
tipsy
shadow
the
door
swung
back
slightly
it
opened
into
the
room
and
a
man
came
out
of
it
and
crossed
directly
in
front
of
me
probably
to
his
room
in
the
other
arm
of
the
once
out
of
the
door
it
snapped
softly
to
behind
him
and
the
man
fell
instantly
into
a
manner
that
disconnected
him
with
it
to
a
degree
that
could
only
have
been
possible
to
an
accomplished
actor
if
i
had
not
seen
him
come
out
of
it
i
should
have
supposed
him
abroad
upon
such
a
casual
errand
as
my
own
but
there
was
no
mistaking
that
it
was
manager
by
the
clock
it
was
a
quarter
past
one
and
he
would
have
been
home
from
the
theatre
more
than
an
hour
i
got
up
to
my
room
somehow
i
think
my
neuralgia
must
have
left
me
with
the
shock
i
ca
remember
feeling
it
any
more
after
that
you
have
to
remember
that
this
was
my
first
actual
contact
with
sin
of
any
sort
generations
of
the
stock
of
methodism
revolted
in
me
i
had
liked
the
man
i
had
thought
of
our
relation
as
something
precious
to
be
kept
intact
because
it
nourished
the
quality
of
our
art
and
i
had
all
the
conventional
woman
horror
of
being
brought
in
touch
with
looseness
it
was
part
of
the
admitted
business
of
the
men
of
my
class
to
keep
their
women
from
such
contacts
and
manager
had
allowed
me
to
enter
into
a
sort
of
rivalry
with
a
shameless
woman
with
his
mistress
i
have
always
been
what
the
country
people
in
ohianna
call
a
knowledgable
woman
i
have
not
much
faculty
of
getting
news
of
a
situation
through
the
facts
as
they
present
themselves
but
i
have
instincts
which
under
the
stimulus
of
emotion
work
with
extraordinary
celerity
and
thoroughness
now
suddenly
the
suggestion
of
the
last
few
months
took
fire
from
the
excitement
of
my
mind
and
exploded
into
certainties
i
sensed
all
at
once
intolerable
things
the
withholden
eyes
the
covert
attention
fixed
on
my
relations
with
the
manager
and
miss
dean
i
lay
on
the
bed
and
shuddered
with
dry
sobs
other
times
i
lay
still
awake
and
blazing
about
daylight
sarah
came
up
to
inquire
how
my
neuralgia
did
she
found
me
with
the
unopened
box
clutched
tightly
in
my
hand
she
turned
up
the
smoky
gas
and
noted
the
dark
circles
under
my
eyes
what
has
happened
something
i
know
she
insisted
gently
i
blurted
it
out
i
saw
him
come
out
of
miss
dean
room
at
a
quarter
of
one
he
was
oh
sarah
he
was
i
relapsed
again
into
the
horror
of
it
oh
she
said
she
turned
out
the
light
and
came
and
forced
me
gently
under
the
covers
and
got
into
bed
beside
me
did
you
know
she
questioned
did
you
no
one
really
knows
these
things
i
did
want
to
be
the
first
to
suggest
it
to
you
do
the
others
know
as
much
as
we
do
it
has
been
going
on
a
long
time
and
you
put
up
with
it
you
go
about
with
them
i
was
astonished
at
the
welling
up
of
disgust
in
me
sarah
felt
for
my
hand
and
held
it
my
dear
in
our
business
you
have
to
learn
to
take
no
notice
it
is
not
that
these
things
are
so
much
worse
with
actors
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
keep
them
covered
up
you
must
know
that
a
great
many
people
do
such
things
i
know
people
i
never
thought
of
its
being
done
by
anybody
you
liked
oh
yes
she
was
perfectly
simple
you
can
like
them
you
can
like
them
greatly
i
remembered
that
i
ought
to
have
said
that
to
sarah
croyden
you
must
think
such
a
bad
man
he
is
probably
fond
of
her
in
some
respects
he
is
a
very
good
man
when
i
was
left
without
a
penny
he
might
have
made
terms
with
me
some
managers
would
but
he
gave
me
a
living
salary
and
left
me
to
myself
he
has
been
very
kind
to
me
but
she
i
choked
back
my
sick
resentment
to
get
at
what
had
been
tearing
its
way
through
my
consciousness
for
the
last
three
hours
she
must
have
thought
that
was
what
i
wanted
of
him
well
it
is
natural
she
should
be
anxious
with
other
women
about
she
is
in
love
with
him
did
you
think
so
about
me
i
mean
no
said
sarah
no
i
did
think
so
it
was
light
enough
now
to
show
the
outline
of
the
drifts
along
the
sills
and
the
fine
gritty
powder
which
the
wind
dashed
intermittently
against
the
panes
the
filter
of
day
under
the
scant
blinds
brought
out
in
the
affair
streaks
of
vulgarity
as
evident
as
the
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
it
seemed
to
borrow
cheapness
from
the
broken
castor
of
the
bureau
as
from
my
recollection
of
the
eaten
face
of
the
clock
and
the
leaning
chandelier
i
sat
up
in
the
bed
and
laid
hold
of
sarah
in
my
eagerness
to
get
clear
of
what
by
my
mere
knowledge
of
it
seemed
an
unbearable
complicity
i
had
a
feeling
for
him
i
admitted
i
could
act
better
with
him
but
it
was
different
from
that
you
know
it
was
different
yes
said
sarah
i
know
i
know
because
i
am
that
way
myself
it
is
that
but
it
is
that
i
was
still
holding
my
breath
while
she
considered
we
were
very
close
upon
the
twined
roots
of
sex
and
art
there
a
feeling
that
goes
with
acting
with
other
sorts
of
things
painting
and
music
maybe
a
feeling
of
your
wanting
to
get
to
something
and
lay
hold
of
it
and
your
not
being
able
to
leaves
you
aching
somehow
and
you
think
if
there
a
particular
person
i
think
would
understand
it
is
being
able
to
act
makes
you
know
the
difference
i
suppose
he
really
can
act
you
know
and
you
can
but
dean
would
understand
nor
the
others
my
lawrence
understand
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
mentioned
him
to
me
sometimes
i
think
they
might
have
felt
the
difference
just
at
first
but
nobody
told
them
and
they
got
used
to
thinking
it
is
the
other
thing
she
drew
me
down
into
the
bed
again
and
covered
me
you
take
it
to
hard
we
all
go
through
it
once
and
you
are
safe
so
long
as
you
know
but
i
ca
go
on
with
it
i
was
positive
on
that
point
sarah
sarah
do
say
i
have
to
go
on
with
it
i
know
you
ca
but
you
just
have
to
i
should
never
be
able
to
face
either
of
them
again
without
showing
that
i
know
and
then
the
others
will
know
and
they
will
think
i
threw
out
my
arms
seeing
how
i
was
trapped
i
wanted
to
cry
out
on
them
to
despise
the
woman
openly
and
they
will
think
that
i
am
jealous
that
i
wanted
it
myself
i
rolled
in
the
bed
and
bit
my
hands
with
shame
and
anger
sarah
caught
me
in
her
arms
and
held
me
until
the
paroxysm
passed
i
was
quieted
at
last
from
exhaustion
you
can
stay
in
your
room
she
suggested
i
can
bring
your
meals
up
to
you
this
neuralgia
will
give
you
an
excuse
and
you
see
any
one
until
you
go
to
the
theatre
that
will
give
you
one
day
maybe
by
but
i
had
no
confidence
that
would
bring
me
any
sensible
relief
the
moral
shock
was
tremendous
all
my
pride
was
engaged
on
the
side
of
never
letting
anybody
know
to
have
been
misunderstood
in
the
quality
of
my
disgust
would
have
been
the
intolerable
last
thing
sarah
brought
up
my
breakfast
before
she
had
her
own
she
reported
nobody
about
yet
except
jimmy
vantine
who
had
inquired
for
me
about
half
an
hour
later
she
came
softly
in
again
with
a
yellow
envelope
open
in
her
hand
i
saw
by
her
face
that
it
was
for
me
and
that
the
news
it
contained
put
the
present
situation
out
of
question
is
it
from
my
husband
i
demanded
i
hardly
knew
what
i
hoped
or
expected
a
possibility
of
release
flashed
up
in
me
it
has
been
forwarded
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
me
my
poor
olivia
you
must
try
to
think
of
it
as
anything
but
a
way
out
will
let
you
go
for
this
if
it
had
to
happen
it
have
happened
better
give
it
to
me
remember
it
is
a
way
out
i
read
it
hastily
mother
had
a
stroke
come
at
once
signed
forester
chapter
vii
it
was
a
common
practice
in
taylorville
never
to
send
for
the
doctor
until
you
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
you
so
long
as
the
symptoms
failed
to
align
themselves
with
any
known
disorder
they
were
supposed
to
be
amenable
to
neighbourly
advice
to
the
common
stock
of
medical
misinformation
to
the
almanac
or
some
such
repository
of
science
and
though
this
practice
led
on
too
many
occasions
to
the
disease
getting
past
the
curable
stages
before
the
physician
was
called
i
never
remember
to
have
heard
it
questioned
you
see
people
remarked
to
one
another
at
the
funeral
they
know
what
was
the
matter
with
her
until
it
was
too
late
and
it
passed
for
all
extenuation
it
was
natural
then
that
my
mother
should
have
kept
any
premonitory
symptoms
of
her
indisposition
even
from
forester
close
as
they
were
in
their
affections
she
would
have
thought
it
indelicate
to
have
spoken
to
him
of
her
health
the
first
determinate
stroke
of
it
came
upon
her
sitting
quietly
in
her
usual
place
at
prayer
meeting
on
a
wednesday
evening
it
had
been
forester
habit
to
close
the
shop
a
little
early
on
that
evening
going
around
to
the
church
to
walk
home
with
her
getting
in
before
the
last
hymn
to
save
his
face
with
the
minister
by
a
show
of
regular
attendance
but
on
this
evening
customers
detained
him
beyond
his
usual
hour
so
that
by
the
time
he
reached
the
corner
opposite
the
church
he
saw
the
people
dribbling
out
by
twos
and
threes
across
the
lighted
doorway
and
noted
that
my
mother
was
not
with
them
he
thought
she
might
have
slipped
out
earlier
and
gone
around
to
the
shop
for
him
as
occasionally
happened
but
seeing
the
lights
did
not
go
out
at
once
in
the
church
he
looked
in
to
make
sure
and
saw
her
still
sitting
in
her
accustomed
place
the
sexton
and
the
organist
who
were
fussing
together
about
a
broken
pedal
appeared
not
to
have
observed
her
there
and
one
of
them
was
reaching
up
to
put
out
the
light
when
forester
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
she
started
and
seemed
to
come
awake
with
an
effort
and
on
the
way
home
she
stumbled
once
or
twice
in
a
manner
that
led
him
totally
unaccustomed
as
he
was
to
think
of
my
mother
as
ill
in
any
sort
to
get
a
little
entertainment
out
of
it
by
gentle
rallying
which
was
dropped
when
he
discovered
that
it
caused
her
genuine
pained
embarrassment
the
following
tuesday
he
came
home
to
the
midday
meal
to
find
her
lying
on
the
floor
inarticulate
and
hardly
conscious
there
must
have
been
two
strokes
in
close
succession
for
she
had
managed
after
falling
to
get
a
cushion
from
the
worn
lounge
under
her
head
and
to
pull
a
shawl
partly
over
her
effie
who
was
at
montecito
was
summoned
home
and
that
evening
by
the
advice
the
telegram
was
sent
which
separated
me
so
opportunely
from
the
shamrocks
by
the
time
i
reached
her
speech
had
returned
in
a
measure
and
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
she
was
able
to
be
lifted
into
the
chair
which
she
never
afterward
left
i
remember
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
noble
outline
of
her
face
and
of
her
head
against
the
pillows
the
smooth
hair
parted
and
brought
low
across
her
ears
the
blue
of
her
eyes
looking
out
of
the
dark
swollen
circles
for
all
her
years
with
the
unawakened
clarity
of
a
girl
stricken
as
i
was
from
my
first
realizing
contact
with
sin
and
my
identification
with
it
through
the
assumed
passions
of
the
stage
it
grew
upon
me
during
the
days
of
my
mother
illness
that
there
was
a
kind
of
intrinsic
worth
in
her
which
i
with
all
my
powers
must
forever
and
inalienably
miss
with
it
there
came
a
kind
of
exasperation
never
quite
to
leave
me
of
the
certainty
of
not
choosing
my
own
values
but
of
being
driven
with
them
aside
and
apart
it
was
responsible
in
part
for
a
feeling
i
had
of
being
somehow
less
related
to
my
mother
house
than
many
of
her
distant
kin
who
were
continually
arriving
out
of
all
quarters
in
wagons
and
top
buggies
to
express
a
continuity
of
interest
and
kind
which
had
the
effect
of
constituting
me
definitely
outside
the
bond
the
situation
was
furthered
no
doubt
by
the
whisper
of
my
connection
with
the
stage
which
got
about
and
set
up
in
them
an
attitude
of
circumspection
out
of
which
i
caught
them
at
times
regarding
me
with
a
curiosity
unmixed
with
any
human
sympathy
yet
i
recall
how
keen
an
appetite
i
had
for
what
this
illness
of
my
mother
had
thrown
into
relief
the
web
of
passionate
human
interactions
bone
and
body
of
the
spirituality
that
went
clothed
as
gracelessly
in
the
routine
of
their
daily
lives
as
the
figures
of
the
men
under
the
unyielding
ugliness
of
store
clothing
it
came
out
in
the
talk
of
the
women
sitting
about
the
base
burner
at
night
with
their
skirts
folded
back
carefully
across
their
knees
in
the
watches
we
found
it
necessary
to
keep
for
the
first
fortnight
or
so
i
remember
one
of
these
occasions
as
the
particular
instance
by
which
my
mother
emerged
for
me
from
her
condition
of
parenthood
to
the
common
plane
of
humanity
by
way
of
an
old
romance
of
her
with
cousin
judd
cousin
lydia
sat
up
with
her
that
night
and
almira
jewett
a
brisk
country
clad
woman
of
the
skaldic
temperament
who
from
long
handling
of
the
histories
of
her
clan
had
acquired
an
absolute
art
of
it
she
was
own
sister
to
the
woman
who
married
my
mother
and
the
saga
of
the
judds
and
the
wilsons
and
the
jewetts
and
the
lattimores
ran
off
the
points
of
her
bright
needles
as
she
sat
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
with
a
click
and
a
spark
cousin
lydia
never
knitted
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
large
lap
and
time
seemed
to
rest
with
her
it
will
be
hard
on
judd
almira
offered
to
the
unspoken
reference
forever
in
the
air
as
to
the
possible
fatal
termination
of
my
illness
yes
it
be
hard
on
him
a
faint
so
faint
nuance
of
assent
in
cousin
lydia
voice
seemed
to
admit
the
succeeding
comment
shorn
of
impertinence
i
guessed
that
the
several
members
of
the
tribe
were
relieved
rather
than
constrained
to
drop
their
intimate
concerns
into
almira
jewett
impartial
histories
i
never
almira
invited
did
get
the
straight
of
that
sally
was
engaged
to
him
war
she
not
to
say
engaged
cousin
lydia
paused
for
just
the
right
shade
of
relation
but
so
as
to
want
to
be
judd
set
store
by
her
he
have
had
it
that
way
anyway
but
sally
could
make
up
her
mind
to
it
on
account
of
their
being
own
cousins
i
reckon
she
had
the
right
of
it
the
lord
do
seem
no
way
pleased
with
kin
marrying
i
do
know
i
do
know
cousin
lydia
dropped
the
speculation
into
the
pit
of
her
own
experience
it
looks
like
he
would
have
made
to
care
about
it
then
but
being
as
she
saw
it
that
way
they
have
done
different
not
that
judd
did
see
it
in
the
light
of
his
duty
too
there
was
evidently
nothing
in
the
annals
of
the
judds
and
the
lattimores
which
allowed
a
violation
of
the
inward
monitor
well
i
must
say
he
has
turned
it
into
grace
if
ever
a
man
has
not
to
say
but
what
you
helped
him
to
it
it
was
in
the
manner
of
almira
concession
of
not
in
the
matter
that
cousin
judd
had
chosen
lydia
chiefly
for
her
capacity
not
to
offer
any
distraction
to
his
profounder
passion
and
nothing
in
cousin
lydia
comment
to
deny
it
from
the
room
beyond
we
could
hear
the
inarticulate
notice
of
my
mother
pain
cousin
lydia
moved
to
attend
her
all
those
years
i
whispered
to
almira
she
has
loved
him
and
he
has
loved
my
mother
i
was
pierced
through
with
the
pure
sword
of
the
spirit
which
had
divided
them
but
almira
was
more
practical
she
was
better
off
almira
insisted
lydia
had
no
knack
with
men
folk
ever
she
knew
judd
would
have
loved
her
but
so
long
as
he
loved
your
mother
she
was
safe
they
got
a
good
deal
out
of
it
her
knowing
and
sympathizing
she
could
sympathize
you
see
for
she
knew
how
it
was
herself
loving
judd
that
way
it
was
no
more
than
right
they
should
get
what
they
could
out
of
it
it
was
the
only
thing
they
had
between
them
all
those
years
i
said
again
i
felt
myself
immeasurably
lifted
out
of
the
mists
and
mires
of
the
shamrocks
into
clear
and
aching
atmospheres
i
will
say
this
for
lydia
extenuated
the
skald
that
though
she
had
no
gift
to
draw
a
man
to
her
she
knew
how
to
hold
her
hand
off
and
let
him
go
his
own
thought
it
was
religion
kept
your
mother
and
judd
apart
and
yet
it
was
in
religion
they
comforted
one
another
lydia
never
put
herself
forward
like
she
might
claiming
it
was
her
religion
too
and
she
was
one
that
appreciated
church
privileges
but
i
wondered
where
my
father
came
in
it
had
been
i
knew
a
passionate
attachment
like
a
new
house
said
almira
built
up
where
the
old
one
has
been
but
the
cellars
of
it
do
change
real
loving
is
never
really
got
over
i
felt
the
phrase
sounding
in
some
subterranean
crypt
of
my
own
with
this
new
light
on
it
it
came
out
for
me
wonderfully
in
my
face
as
i
watched
her
through
the
anxious
days
how
much
her
life
had
been
stayed
in
renunciations
i
suppose
my
new
appreciation
must
have
shone
out
for
her
as
well
for
i
could
see
rising
out
of
her
disorder
like
a
drowned
person
out
of
the
sea
a
bond
of
our
common
experience
we
were
two
women
together
at
last
my
mother
and
i
and
could
have
speech
with
one
another
something
no
doubt
contributed
to
this
new
understanding
by
an
affair
of
forester
which
as
i
began
to
be
acquainted
with
the
incidents
preceding
it
i
believed
to
be
partly
responsible
for
my
stroke
i
have
already
sketched
to
you
how
forester
had
grown
up
in
the
need
of
finding
himself
always
at
the
centre
of
feminine
interest
without
the
opportunity
of
satisfying
it
normally
by
marriage
and
how
the
too
early
stimulation
of
sentiment
and
affection
had
led
to
his
being
handed
about
from
girl
to
girl
in
the
attempt
to
gratify
his
need
without
transgressing
any
of
the
lines
marked
out
by
his
profession
as
an
eminently
nice
young
man
it
came
naturally
out
of
the
mere
circumstance
of
there
being
a
limited
number
of
girls
at
hand
whom
he
might
conceivably
court
without
the
intention
of
marrying
for
him
to
fall
into
the
society
of
others
whom
he
might
not
court
but
who
might
nevertheless
find
it
much
to
their
advantage
to
marry
him
i
do
not
know
how
and
when
it
came
to
my
mother
ears
that
he
was
calling
frequently
at
the
jastrows
very
likely
they
brought
it
to
her
notice
themselves
they
were
a
poor
pushing
sort
forever
exposing
themselves
to
the
slights
arising
from
their
own
undesirability
which
they
forever
tearfully
attributed
to
an
undeserved
and
paraded
poverty
they
paraded
it
now
as
the
insuperable
bar
to
all
that
they
might
have
done
for
my
mother
all
that
they
actually
had
it
in
their
hearts
to
do
on
their
assumption
of
a
right
of
being
interested
an
assumption
which
even
in
her
weakness
before
she
could
trust
herself
to
talk
very
much
i
felt
her
dumbly
imploring
me
to
deny
the
girl
lily
they
called
her
was
not
without
a
certain
appeal
to
the
senses
and
knowing
rather
more
of
my
brother
methods
i
did
not
find
jastrow
pretension
to
a
community
of
interest
in
what
might
be
expected
to
come
of
his
attention
altogether
unjustified
but
in
view
of
mother
condition
and
what
effie
told
me
of
the
way
business
was
going
rather
was
not
going
at
all
any
kind
of
marriage
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
it
was
the
way
i
put
the
finality
of
that
into
my
dealings
with
jastrow
that
drew
mother
over
into
the
only
relation
of
normal
human
interdependence
i
was
ever
to
have
with
her
whenever
jastrow
would
come
to
call
with
that
air
she
had
in
her
dress
and
manner
of
being
pulled
together
and
made
the
best
of
i
could
see
my
mother
fears
signalling
to
me
from
the
region
of
tremors
and
faintness
in
which
she
had
sunk
and
i
would
set
my
wits
up
as
a
defence
against
what
considering
all
there
was
against
her
was
a
really
gallant
effort
on
jastrow
part
to
make
out
of
forester
philanderings
a
basis
for
a
family
intimacy
it
was
plain
that
neither
my
mother
nor
jastrow
dared
put
the
question
to
forester
but
rested
their
case
on
such
mutual
admissions
of
it
as
they
could
wring
from
one
another
i
could
never
make
out
on
my
mother
part
whether
she
was
really
afraid
of
the
issue
or
if
in
the
preoccupation
of
their
affection
both
she
and
forester
had
overlooked
his
young
man
right
to
a
woman
and
a
life
of
his
own
through
all
her
dumb
struggle
against
it
never
but
once
did
my
mother
openly
face
the
ultimate
possibility
of
his
marriage
with
lily
jastrow
it
was
about
the
third
week
of
her
illness
and
jastrow
making
one
of
her
interminable
calls
had
been
brought
so
nearly
to
the
point
of
tears
by
my
imperiousness
that
effie
had
been
obliged
to
draw
her
off
into
the
kitchen
to
have
her
opinion
about
a
recipe
for
a
mince
meat
such
as
she
knew
the
jastrows
could
afford
to
be
instructed
in
and
so
had
gotten
her
out
of
the
side
door
and
started
down
the
walk
before
the
situation
could
come
to
a
head
my
mother
watched
her
go
do
you
think
she
hazarded
suddenly
that
forester
really
is
engaged
to
her
to
lily
oh
no
forester
does
get
engaged
to
girls
he
just
dangles
it
was
characteristic
of
my
mother
partiality
that
even
damaging
insinuations
such
as
this
slid
off
from
it
as
too
far
from
the
possibility
to
be
even
entertained
perhaps
a
trace
of
my
old
exasperation
with
the
whole
situation
and
the
glimpse
i
had
of
jastrow
letting
herself
out
of
our
gate
with
her
assumption
of
being
as
good
as
anybody
still
to
the
fore
but
a
little
awry
prompted
me
to
add
and
it
is
only
natural
for
her
mother
to
make
the
most
of
it
looking
out
for
her
own
just
as
you
are
a
mother
has
a
right
to
do
that
she
protested
to
keep
them
from
making
themselves
miserable
it
is
no
more
than
her
duty
yes
i
said
the
remark
had
the
effect
of
a
challenge
young
people
do
know
how
to
choose
for
themselves
they
make
mistakes
she
revolved
something
in
her
mind
you
now
unhappy
are
you
olivia
yes
oh
yes
i
had
not
thought
of
myself
as
being
so
particularly
but
i
did
not
see
my
way
to
deny
it
i
been
afraid
sometimes
since
you
wrote
me
about
going
on
the
stage
maybe
you
were
exactly
satisfied
but
it
is
that
is
it
no
mother
it
is
that
there
you
see
she
shook
off
her
weakness
with
the
conviction
and
you
might
have
been
if
i
had
looked
out
for
you
a
little
why
mother
what
could
you
possibly
she
triumphed
you
remember
that
garrett
boy
that
was
visiting
at
his
uncle
he
called
that
night
the
night
you
were
engaged
to
tommy
yes
i
remember
you
sent
him
away
he
was
suitable
at
all
smoking
and
driving
about
on
sunday
that
way
her
tone
was
defensive
he
left
a
letter
that
night
mother
you
did
tell
me
i
was
thinking
it
over
i
had
a
right
you
were
too
young
mother
did
you
read
it
i
looked
at
it
you
had
met
him
but
once
and
i
had
a
right
to
know
and
that
night
you
were
engaged
i
took
it
for
a
sign
and
the
letter
it
seemed
all
at
once
an
immeasurable
and
irreparable
loss
i
sent
it
back
and
anyway
it
turned
out
all
right
i
was
possessed
for
the
moment
with
the
conviction
that
it
was
all
dreadfully
despairingly
wrong
i
could
have
borne
for
you
to
marry
anybody
but
a
christian
olivia
i
thought
of
tommy
exceedingly
slender
claim
to
that
distinction
and
i
laughed
tommy
smokes
i
said
he
says
he
has
to
do
it
with
the
customers
oh
but
not
as
a
habit
olivia
i
overrode
that
tell
me
what
became
of
him
of
garrett
did
you
ever
hear
he
went
west
she
recollected
i
asked
his
aunt
he
quarrelled
with
them
because
his
uncle
would
send
him
to
school
at
his
age
they
thought
it
was
suitable
i
would
have
wanted
you
to
go
west
olivia
i
took
her
worn
hands
in
mine
it
all
right
mother
i
not
going
west
and
i
not
going
on
the
stage
any
more
i
done
with
it
i
felt
so
passionately
at
the
time
we
sat
quietly
for
a
time
in
that
assurance
and
listened
to
effie
singing
in
the
kitchen
olivia
she
began
timidly
at
last
are
you
ever
going
to
have
any
more
children
oh
i
hope
so
mother
i
have
been
strong
you
know
since
the
first
one
we
did
think
it
advisable
well
if
you
can
manage
it
that
way
there
was
a
trace
in
her
tone
of
the
woman
who
had
been
able
to
manage
i
wished
to
reassure
her
when
i
was
in
the
hospital
the
doctor
told
me
i
could
see
the
deep
flush
rising
over
her
face
and
neck
there
were
some
things
which
her
generation
had
never
faced
i
let
them
fall
with
her
hands
and
sat
gazing
at
the
red
core
of
the
base
burner
waiting
until
she
should
take
up
her
thought
again
i
used
to
think
those
things
were
right
olivia
but
i
do
know
sometimes
i
think
it
is
right
either
to
bring
them
into
the
world
when
there
is
no
welcome
for
them
she
struggled
with
the
admission
you
and
i
olivia
we
never
got
on
together
but
that
all
past
now
mother
she
clung
to
me
for
a
while
for
reassurance
i
hope
so
i
hope
so
but
still
there
are
things
i
always
wanted
to
tell
you
when
you
wrote
me
about
going
on
the
stage
there
are
wild
things
in
you
olivia
things
i
never
looked
for
in
a
daughter
of
mine
things
i
ca
understand
nor
account
for
unless
unless
it
was
i
turned
you
against
life
my
kind
of
life
before
you
were
born
the
time
i
seen
you
hating
it
and
i
been
harsh
with
you
but
i
wanted
you
should
know
i
was
being
harsh
with
myself
mother
dear
is
it
good
for
you
to
talk
so
yes
yes
i
wanted
to
you
see
it
was
after
your
father
came
home
from
the
war
and
we
were
all
broken
up
forester
was
sickly
and
there
was
the
one
that
died
so
when
i
knew
you
were
coming
i
hated
you
olivia
i
wanted
things
different
i
hated
you
until
i
heard
you
cry
you
cried
all
the
time
when
you
were
little
olivia
and
it
was
i
that
was
crying
in
you
i
expected
some
punishment
would
come
of
it
oh
hush
hush
mother
i
should
have
liked
it
either
in
your
place
besides
they
say
the
scientists
that
it
is
so
that
things
before
you
are
born
can
affect
you
as
much
as
that
she
moved
her
head
feebly
on
the
pillows
in
denial
they
can
say
that
but
we
never
got
on
there
things
in
you
that
are
natural
for
any
daughter
of
mine
they
can
say
that
olivia
but
we
we
know
yes
mother
we
know
i
took
her
hands
again
and
nursed
them
against
my
cheek
after
a
time
tears
began
to
drip
down
her
flaccid
cheeks
and
i
wiped
them
away
for
her
do
mother
do
we
get
along
now
anyway
and
as
for
the
things
in
me
which
are
different
do
you
know
mother
i
getting
to
know
that
they
are
the
best
things
in
me
i
honestly
thought
so
and
after
all
these
years
i
think
so
now
i
wheeled
her
into
the
bedroom
presently
where
she
fell
into
the
light
slumber
of
the
feeble
and
seemed
afterward
hardly
to
remember
but
i
was
glad
then
to
have
talked
it
all
out
with
her
for
though
she
lived
nearly
two
years
after
before
i
saw
her
again
another
stroke
had
deprived
her
of
articulateness
chapter
viii
i
went
home
to
my
husband
after
it
began
to
seem
certain
that
my
mother
condition
would
not
change
for
some
time
but
i
knew
in
the
going
that
neither
tommy
nor
higgleston
could
ever
present
themselves
to
me
again
in
the
aspect
of
an
absolute
destiny
by
the
incidents
of
the
past
few
weeks
i
had
been
pulled
free
from
the
obsession
of
inevitableness
with
which
my
life
had
clothed
itself
until
now
i
stood
outside
of
it
and
questioned
it
in
the
light
of
what
it
might
have
been
what
it
might
yet
become
suppose
i
had
received
helmeth
letter
suppose
my
interest
in
had
wavered
a
breadth
out
of
the
community
of
work
into
that
more
personal
and
particular
passion
i
quaked
in
the
cold
blasts
which
blew
on
me
out
of
unsuspected
doors
opening
on
my
life
and
still
i
went
back
to
higgleston
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
i
think
i
deceived
myself
with
the
notion
that
there
was
something
in
tommy
resistance
to
a
more
acceptable
destiny
that
could
be
resolved
and
dissipated
by
the
proper
stimulus
but
i
knew
in
fact
that
he
and
higgleston
suited
one
another
admirably
to
my
husband
that
he
should
keep
a
clothing
store
in
a
town
of
five
thousand
inhabitants
was
part
of
the
great
natural
causation
the
single
change
to
which
our
condition
was
liable
was
that
the
business
might
take
a
turn
which
would
enable
us
to
move
out
of
the
store
into
a
house
of
our
own
it
had
not
occurred
to
tommy
to
take
a
turn
himself
the
men
tailors
and
outfitters
lay
like
most
business
in
higgleston
in
the
back
water
rocking
at
times
in
the
wake
of
the
world
traffic
but
never
moving
with
it
there
was
a
vague
notion
of
progress
abroad
which
resulted
in
our
going
through
the
motions
of
the
main
current
the
live
business
men
organized
a
board
of
trade
and
rented
a
room
to
hold
meetings
in
but
i
do
not
remember
that
when
they
had
met
anything
came
of
it
the
great
tides
of
trade
went
about
the
world
and
our
little
fleet
rocked
up
and
down
if
i
had
ever
had
any
hope
that
tommy
and
i
might
out
of
our
common
stock
somehow
hoist
sail
and
make
a
way
out
of
it
in
that
spring
and
summer
i
completely
lost
it
i
believe
tommy
thought
we
were
perfectly
happy
considering
how
things
turned
out
i
am
glad
to
have
it
so
but
the
fact
is
there
was
not
between
us
so
much
as
a
common
taste
in
furniture
in
the
five
years
of
married
life
our
home
had
filled
up
with
articles
which
by
colour
and
line
and
unfitness
jarred
on
every
sense
tommy
had
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
an
ear
for
music
and
if
the
warring
discords
of
our
furnishings
could
have
been
translated
into
sound
he
would
have
gone
distracted
with
it
being
as
it
was
he
bought
me
a
fire
screen
for
my
birthday
miss
rathbone
it
for
the
baptist
bazaar
and
tommy
had
bought
it
at
three
times
what
we
could
have
afforded
for
a
suitable
ornament
it
was
his
notion
of
our
relations
that
we
and
the
rathbones
should
do
things
like
that
by
one
another
i
suppose
you
can
find
the
like
of
that
fire
screen
at
some
county
fair
still
in
ohianna
but
you
will
find
nothing
more
atrocious
tommy
liked
to
have
it
sitting
well
out
in
the
room
where
he
could
admire
it
he
would
remark
upon
it
sometimes
with
complacency
evenings
after
the
store
was
shut
up
before
he
sat
down
in
his
old
coat
and
slippers
to
read
the
paper
occasionally
i
read
to
him
out
of
a
magazine
or
a
play
i
had
picked
up
in
the
intervals
of
which
i
used
to
catch
him
furtively
keeping
up
with
his
newspaper
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
now
and
then
we
went
out
to
a
sociable
or
to
the
rathbones
for
supper
less
frequently
we
had
them
to
a
meal
with
us
it
was
characteristic
of
business
partnerships
in
higgleston
that
they
involved
you
in
obligations
of
chicken
salad
and
banana
cake
and
the
best
tablecloth
tommy
enjoyed
these
occasions
and
if
he
had
allowed
himself
to
criticise
me
at
all
it
would
have
been
for
my
ineptitude
at
the
happy
social
usage
things
went
on
so
with
us
month
after
month
and
if
you
ask
me
why
i
did
take
the
chance
life
offers
to
women
to
justify
themselves
to
the
race
i
will
say
that
though
the
hope
of
a
child
presents
itself
sentimentally
as
opportunity
it
figures
primarily
in
the
calculation
of
the
majority
as
a
question
of
expense
the
hard
times
foreseen
by
burton
brothers
hung
in
the
air
we
had
not
in
fact
been
able
to
do
more
than
keep
up
the
interest
on
what
was
still
due
on
the
stock
and
fixtures
nor
had
i
even
quite
recovered
the
bodily
equilibrium
disturbed
by
my
first
encounter
with
the
rending
powers
of
life
there
was
a
time
when
the
spring
came
on
in
a
fulness
when
the
procreant
impulse
stirred
awake
i
saw
myself
adequately
employed
shaping
men
for
it
maybe
but
the
immediate
deterring
fact
was
the
payment
to
be
made
in
august
i
went
on
living
in
higgleston
where
human
intercourse
was
organized
on
the
basis
that
whatever
a
woman
has
of
intelligence
and
worth
over
and
above
the
sum
of
such
capacity
in
man
is
to
be
excised
as
a
superfluous
growth
a
monstrosity
does
anybody
remember
what
the
woman
world
was
like
in
small
towns
before
the
days
of
woman
clubs
there
was
a
world
of
cooking
and
making
over
there
was
a
world
of
and
missionary
societies
and
ministerial
coöperation
half
grudged
and
half
assumed
as
a
virtue
which
since
it
was
the
only
thing
that
lay
outside
themselves
was
not
without
extenuation
and
there
was
another
world
which
underlay
all
this
coloured
and
occasioned
it
sicklied
over
with
futility
it
was
a
world
all
of
the
care
and
expectancy
of
children
overshadowed
by
the
recurrent
monthly
dread
crept
about
by
whispers
heretical
but
persistent
of
methods
of
circumventing
it
of
a
secret
practice
of
things
openly
condemned
it
was
a
world
that
went
half
the
time
in
or
unwilling
or
rebellious
anticipation
and
half
on
the
broken
springs
of
what
as
the
subject
of
the
endless
objectionable
discussions
went
by
the
name
of
female
complaints
in
all
this
there
was
no
room
for
olivia
somehow
the
ordering
of
our
four
rooms
over
the
store
did
appeal
to
me
as
a
justification
of
existence
and
i
did
care
to
undertake
again
matching
the
adventures
of
my
neighbours
in
the
field
of
domestic
economy
with
mine
in
the
department
of
let
any
one
who
disbelieves
it
try
if
he
can
assure
the
acceptance
of
his
art
on
its
merit
as
work
free
of
the
implication
of
egotism
you
may
talk
about
a
new
frosting
for
cake
or
an
aeroplane
you
have
invented
but
you
must
not
speak
of
a
new
verse
form
or
a
plastic
effect
all
this
time
in
spite
of
my
recent
revulsion
from
it
i
was
consumed
with
the
desire
of
acting
my
faculty
ached
for
use
it
woke
me
in
the
night
and
wasted
me
i
had
wild
thoughts
such
as
men
have
in
the
grip
of
an
unjustifiable
passion
all
my
imaginings
at
that
time
were
of
events
untoward
fantastic
which
should
somehow
throw
me
back
upon
the
stage
without
the
necessity
on
my
part
of
a
moral
conclusion
sarah
croyden
to
whom
i
wrote
voluminously
could
not
understand
why
i
resisted
it
there
was
after
all
no
actual
opposition
except
what
lay
inherent
in
my
traditions
sarah
had
such
a
way
of
accepting
life
she
used
it
and
her
gift
mine
used
me
i
saw
that
it
might
even
abuse
me
she
went
by
nature
undefended
and
unharmed
from
the
sword
that
keeps
the
gates
of
creative
art
but
me
it
pierced
even
to
the
dividing
of
soul
and
spirit
my
husband
stood
always
curiously
outside
the
consideration
i
think
he
was
scarcely
aware
of
what
went
on
in
me
if
any
news
of
my
tormented
state
reached
him
he
would
have
seen
except
as
it
was
mollified
by
affection
what
all
higgleston
saw
in
it
the
restlessness
of
vanity
a
craving
for
excitement
for
praise
and
a
vague
taint
of
irregularity
he
was
sympathetic
to
the
point
of
admitting
that
higgleston
was
dull
he
thought
we
might
join
the
chatauqua
society
or
you
might
get
up
a
class
he
suggested
hopefully
it
would
give
you
something
to
think
about
teach
i
cried
teach
when
i
just
aching
to
learn
well
then
he
achieved
a
triumph
of
reasonableness
if
you
know
enough
to
teach
in
higgleston
how
are
you
going
to
succeed
on
the
stage
it
was
not
tommy
however
but
a
much
worse
man
who
made
up
my
mind
for
me
he
had
been
brought
out
from
chicago
during
my
absence
to
set
up
in
higgleston
one
department
store
that
factitious
air
of
things
being
done
which
passed
for
the
evidence
of
modernity
he
had
in
the
set
of
his
clothes
the
way
he
made
the
most
of
his
hair
and
the
least
of
the
puffiness
about
his
eyes
the
effect
of
having
done
something
successfully
for
himself
which
i
believe
was
the
utmost
recommendation
he
had
for
the
place
he
preferred
himself
to
my
favour
on
the
strength
of
having
seen
more
than
a
little
of
the
theatre
very
soon
after
my
return
he
took
to
dropping
into
my
husband
store
which
in
view
of
its
being
patronized
by
men
who
were
chiefly
otherwise
occupied
during
the
day
was
kept
open
rather
late
in
the
evenings
from
sheer
loneliness
i
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
going
down
after
supper
to
wait
on
a
stray
customer
while
tommy
made
up
the
books
montague
who
went
familiarly
about
town
by
the
name
of
monty
would
come
in
then
and
loll
across
the
counter
chatting
to
me
while
tommy
sat
at
his
desk
with
a
green
shade
over
his
eyes
and
rathbone
who
never
came
more
than
a
step
or
two
out
of
his
character
as
working
tailor
clattered
about
with
his
irons
in
the
back
half
screened
by
the
racks
of
custom
made
nobby
suits
which
made
up
most
of
our
stock
in
trade
i
had
already
without
paying
much
attention
to
it
become
accustomed
to
the
shifting
of
men
interest
in
me
the
moment
my
connection
with
the
stage
became
known
a
certain
speculation
in
the
eye
a
freshening
of
the
wind
in
the
neighbourhood
of
adventure
but
by
degrees
it
began
to
work
through
my
preoccupations
that
montague
attention
had
the
quality
of
settled
expectation
the
suggestion
of
a
relation
apart
from
the
casual
social
contact
which
it
wanted
but
an
opportunity
to
fulfill
it
took
the
form
very
early
when
tommy
would
look
up
from
his
entries
and
adding
up
to
make
his
cheerful
contribution
to
the
conversation
of
an
attempt
to
include
me
in
a
covert
irritation
at
the
interruption
if
by
any
chance
he
found
me
alone
his
response
to
the
potential
impropriety
of
the
occasion
awoke
in
me
the
plain
vulgar
desire
to
box
his
ears
but
no
experience
so
far
served
to
reveal
the
whole
offensiveness
of
the
man
assurance
the
week
that
tommy
went
up
to
chicago
to
do
his
summer
buying
we
made
a
practice
of
closing
rather
early
in
the
long
enervating
evenings
since
hardly
any
customer
could
have
been
inveigled
into
the
store
on
any
account
i
found
it
particularly
irritating
then
to
have
montague
leaning
across
the
counter
to
me
with
a
manner
that
would
have
caused
the
dogs
in
the
street
to
suspect
him
of
intrigue
the
second
or
third
time
this
happened
i
made
a
point
of
slipping
around
to
rathbone
with
the
suggestion
that
if
he
would
shut
up
and
go
home
i
would
take
the
books
upstairs
with
me
and
attend
them
i
was
indifferent
whether
or
not
montague
should
hear
me
but
i
judged
he
had
not
for
far
from
accepting
it
as
a
hint
that
i
wished
to
get
rid
of
him
that
air
he
had
of
covert
understanding
appeared
to
have
increased
in
him
like
a
fever
he
made
no
attempt
to
resume
the
conversation
but
stood
tapping
his
boot
with
a
small
cane
he
affected
a
flush
high
up
under
the
puffy
eyes
the
corners
of
his
mouth
loosened
every
aspect
of
the
man
fairly
bristling
with
an
objectionable
maleness
i
made
believe
to
be
busy
putting
stock
in
order
and
in
a
minute
more
i
could
hear
old
rathbone
come
puttering
out
of
his
corner
to
draw
the
dust
cloths
over
the
racks
of
suits
and
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
interval
fumbling
at
the
knobs
of
the
safe
oh
i
snatched
at
the
opportunity
i
changed
the
combination
let
me
show
you
i
was
around
beside
him
in
a
twinkling
i
called
to
montague
over
my
shoulder
he
said
the
tone
was
charged
the
fumbling
of
the
locks
covered
the
sound
of
his
departure
i
got
rathbone
out
at
the
door
at
last
and
locked
it
behind
him
i
turned
back
to
lower
the
flame
of
the
acetylene
lamp
and
in
the
receding
flare
of
it
between
the
shrouded
racks
i
came
face
to
face
with
montague
he
stood
at
the
outer
ring
of
the
light
and
in
the
shock
of
amazement
i
gave
the
last
turn
of
the
button
which
left
us
in
a
sudden
blinding
dark
i
felt
him
come
toward
me
by
the
sharp
irradiation
of
offensiveness
oh
you
clever
little
joker
you
the
tone
was
fatuous
i
dodged
by
instinct
and
felt
for
the
button
again
to
throw
on
the
flood
of
light
it
caught
him
standing
square
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
in
plain
sight
from
the
street
almost
unconsciously
he
altered
his
attitude
to
one
less
betraying
but
the
response
of
his
mind
to
mine
was
not
so
rapid
i
going
to
shut
up
the
store
i
was
very
quiet
about
it
oblige
me
by
going
oh
come
now
what
the
use
i
thought
you
were
a
woman
of
the
world
i
got
behind
the
counter
past
him
toward
the
door
you
an
actress
you
do
mean
to
say
by
jove
i
not
going
to
be
made
a
fool
of
after
such
an
encouragement
i
not
going
without
montague
i
said
tillie
hemingway
is
coming
to
stay
with
me
nights
she
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
you
better
not
let
her
find
you
here
i
unbarred
the
door
and
threw
it
wide
open
oh
come
now
he
struggled
for
some
footing
other
than
defeat
of
course
if
you
ca
meet
me
like
a
woman
of
the
world
you
a
nice
actress
you
are
i
looked
at
him
the
steps
and
voices
of
passersby
sounded
on
the
pavement
he
went
out
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
i
locked
the
door
after
him
and
double
locked
it
i
climbed
up
to
my
room
and
locked
myself
in
that
the
boiling
of
my
blood
made
such
a
noise
in
my
ears
that
i
could
not
hear
tillie
hemingway
when
she
came
knocking
and
the
poor
girl
went
away
in
tears
after
a
long
time
i
got
to
bed
and
sat
there
with
my
arms
about
my
knees
i
did
not
feel
safe
there
i
knew
i
should
never
be
safe
again
except
in
that
little
square
of
the
world
upon
which
the
footlights
shone
from
which
the
tightening
of
the
reins
of
the
audience
in
my
hands
should
justify
my
life
to
me
i
was
sick
with
longing
for
it
aching
like
a
woman
abandoned
for
the
arms
of
her
beloved
i
fled
toward
it
with
all
my
thought
from
illicit
solicitation
but
it
was
not
the
husband
of
my
body
i
thought
of
in
that
connection
but
the
choice
of
my
soul
people
wonder
why
sensitive
women
are
not
driven
away
from
the
stage
by
the
offences
that
hedge
it
they
are
driven
deeper
and
farther
into
its
enfoldment
there
is
nothing
to
whiten
the
burning
of
its
shames
but
the
high
whiteness
of
its
ultimate
perfection
it
is
so
with
all
art
not
back
in
the
press
of
life
but
forward
on
some
headland
one
loses
behind
the
yelping
pack
and
eases
the
sting
of
resentment
i
did
not
agree
in
the
beginning
to
make
you
understand
this
i
only
tell
you
that
it
is
so
all
that
night
i
sat
with
my
head
upon
my
knees
and
considered
how
i
might
win
back
to
it
i
tried
when
my
husband
came
home
to
put
the
incident
to
him
in
a
way
that
would
stand
for
my
determination
i
did
not
get
so
far
with
it
i
saw
him
shrink
from
the
mere
recital
with
a
timorousness
oh
come
he
could
have
meant
so
bad
as
that
his
male
dread
of
a
situation
plead
with
me
not
to
insist
upon
it
and
he
went
just
as
soon
as
you
told
him
to
of
course
if
he
had
tried
to
force
you
but
you
say
yourself
he
went
quietly
he
was
seeing
and
shrinking
from
what
higgleston
would
get
out
of
the
incident
in
the
way
of
vulgar
entertainment
if
i
insisted
on
his
taking
it
up
by
the
code
there
i
should
have
been
subject
to
such
if
i
had
invited
it
of
course
he
enforced
himself
you
did
right
to
turn
him
down
but
i
do
believe
he
try
it
again
he
wo
have
a
chance
i
going
back
on
the
stage
so
soon
the
implication
of
my
tone
must
have
got
through
even
unimaginativeness
he
said
the
only
bitter
thing
that
i
ever
heard
from
him
well
if
you
had
gone
on
the
stage
in
the
first
place
it
probably
would
have
happened
he
came
round
to
the
situation
in
another
frame
when
he
learned
that
i
had
written
to
sarah
putting
matters
in
train
for
an
engagement
you
will
probably
be
away
all
winter
he
said
it
seems
to
me
olivia
that
you
do
take
any
account
of
the
fact
that
i
am
fond
of
you
we
were
sitting
on
a
little
shelf
of
a
back
balcony
we
had
for
the
sake
of
coolness
and
i
went
and
sat
on
his
knee
i
fond
of
you
tommy
ever
so
but
i
ca
stand
the
life
here
it
smothers
me
and
we
do
do
anything
we
do
get
anywhere
i
do
know
what
you
mean
olivia
we
building
up
quite
a
business
we
be
able
to
make
a
payment
this
year
and
as
the
town
improves
oh
tommy
come
away
come
away
into
the
world
with
me
let
us
go
out
and
do
things
let
us
be
part
of
things
higgleston
good
enough
for
me
we
building
up
trade
and
everybody
says
the
town
is
sure
to
go
ahead
oh
tommy
tommy
what
do
i
care
about
a
business
here
if
we
lose
the
whole
world
and
we
be
old
and
gray
before
we
get
the
business
paid
for
oh
it
is
because
i
do
care
about
you
tommy
because
i
am
not
satisfied
with
you
it
is
the
glory
of
the
world
i
want
and
the
wonder
of
art
and
great
deeds
going
up
and
down
in
it
i
want
us
to
have
that
tommy
to
have
it
together
you
and
i
and
not
another
it
all
there
in
the
world
tommy
all
the
colour
and
the
splendour
great
love
and
great
work
let
us
go
out
and
take
it
let
us
go
i
had
slipped
down
from
his
knees
to
my
own
as
i
talked
pleading
with
him
and
i
saw
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
from
within
his
face
charged
with
pained
bewilderment
settle
into
lines
of
habitual
resistance
to
the
unknown
the
unknowable
my
voice
trailed
out
into
sobbing
of
course
olivia
i
do
want
to
keep
you
if
you
are
not
happy
here
but
i
have
to
stay
myself
his
voice
was
broken
but
determined
with
the
determination
of
a
little
man
not
seeing
far
ahead
of
him
i
have
to
keep
the
business
together
i
went
as
it
was
foredoomed
i
should
about
the
middle
of
september
sarah
and
i
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
get
engagements
together
my
going
upheaving
as
it
had
been
in
respect
to
my
own
adjustments
made
hardly
a
ripple
in
the
life
around
me
even
miss
rathbone
failed
to
rise
to
her
former
heights
but
was
obliged
to
piece
out
her
interest
with
her
customary
dressmaker
manner
of
having
temporarily
overlaid
her
absorption
in
your
affair
with
an
unwilling
distraction
the
rest
of
higgleston
received
the
announcement
with
the
air
of
not
supposing
it
to
be
any
of
their
business
but
that
in
any
case
they
could
approve
of
it
harvey
put
a
common
feminine
view
of
it
very
aptly
i
should
think
she
said
your
husband
would
let
you
it
was
not
a
view
that
was
likely
to
have
a
deterrent
effect
upon
me
chapter
ix
we
had
the
good
fortune
that
year
sarah
and
i
to
be
with
a
manager
who
redeemed
many
the
hardings
for
his
wife
under
her
stage
name
of
estelle
manning
played
with
him
and
was
the
better
half
of
all
his
counsels
were
of
the
sort
of
to
whom
if
the
american
stage
ever
arrives
at
anything
commensurate
with
its
opportunity
it
will
owe
much
they
were
not
either
of
them
of
the
stripe
of
genius
but
up
to
the
limit
of
their
endowment
sound
sincere
and
able
to
interpret
life
to
the
people
through
the
virtue
of
being
so
humanly
of
the
people
themselves
it
was
very
good
for
me
to
be
with
them
not
only
for
the
stage
craft
they
taught
me
but
for
the
healing
of
my
mind
against
the
contagion
of
irresponsibility
the
hardings
taught
me
my
way
about
the
professional
world
the
management
of
my
gift
its
market
value
but
i
am
not
sure
i
do
not
owe
much
more
to
the
fact
that
they
loved
one
another
quite
simply
and
devotedly
and
to
the
certainty
which
they
seemed
to
make
for
us
all
that
loyalty
truth
and
forbearance
were
part
of
the
natural
order
of
things
i
was
aware
when
i
was
with
the
shamrocks
of
a
subconscious
current
against
which
any
mention
of
my
husband
appeared
a
kind
of
gaucherie
it
was
wholesome
for
me
then
to
find
it
expected
of
me
by
the
hardings
that
i
should
act
better
after
i
had
received
a
long
affectionate
letter
from
tommy
and
to
be
able
to
refer
to
it
quite
unaffectedly
everybody
in
the
company
took
the
greatest
interest
in
his
coming
on
at
christmas
to
spend
four
days
with
me
we
had
a
carefully
chosen
company
and
clean
straightforward
plays
which
met
with
gratifying
success
at
the
end
of
february
when
traffic
was
tied
up
during
the
great
ice
storm
i
was
near
enough
to
get
home
to
taylorville
and
spend
a
week
there
tommy
came
to
meet
me
and
we
were
all
happy
together
mother
sitting
nearly
inarticulate
in
her
chair
pleased
as
a
child
to
see
me
doing
all
the
parts
in
our
repertory
and
effie
reading
my
press
notices
to
whoever
could
be
got
to
listen
to
them
i
seemed
to
have
found
the
groove
in
which
the
wheels
of
my
life
went
round
smoothly
i
was
justified
of
much
that
in
my
girlhood
i
had
been
made
to
feel
so
sorely
set
me
reprehensibly
apart
i
remember
forester
telling
how
he
had
heard
charlie
gowers
retailing
the
incident
of
my
having
slapped
him
when
he
tried
to
kiss
me
getting
a
kind
of
reflected
glory
out
of
the
incident
being
so
much
to
my
credit
i
went
back
to
higgleston
in
may
and
was
happier
than
i
had
been
in
the
six
years
of
my
married
life
i
had
my
work
and
my
husband
all
that
i
wanted
now
was
to
bring
the
two
into
closer
relation
it
seemed
not
unlikely
of
accomplishment
with
what
i
had
saved
of
my
salary
tommy
was
able
to
make
quite
a
payment
on
the
business
and
with
the
release
of
that
pressure
the
whole
grip
of
higgleston
seemed
to
be
loosed
from
him
when
i
suggested
that
i
might
get
permanent
engagements
in
chicago
or
louis
where
he
could
establish
himself
he
was
disposed
to
view
it
as
not
unthinkable
in
connection
with
what
might
be
expected
from
a
live
business
man
i
had
to
leave
home
early
in
the
autumn
for
rehearsals
and
to
leave
tommy
by
some
chance
of
the
weather
a
trifle
under
it
i
felt
i
should
have
been
able
to
do
so
if
my
husband
and
miss
rathbone
been
eminently
on
those
terms
that
fulfilled
tommy
ideal
in
respect
to
the
womenfolk
of
his
partner
very
likely
as
she
maintained
it
was
a
feeling
of
caste
that
rendered
her
professional
affectionateness
offensive
to
me
one
had
to
admit
that
when
she
applied
it
to
her
shuffling
peering
old
father
with
eyes
and
a
nose
that
occasionally
wanted
wiping
it
was
every
way
commendable
at
any
rate
i
was
glad
on
this
occasion
to
take
what
she
did
for
old
rathbone
as
an
assurance
that
if
tommy
fell
ill
or
anything
untoward
he
would
lack
for
anything
a
woman
might
do
for
him
that
winter
harding
starred
me
and
what
a
wonderful
winter
it
was
sarah
says
taking
account
of
the
cold
and
the
condition
of
the
roads
it
was
rather
a
hard
one
but
i
was
floated
clear
of
all
such
considerations
on
the
crest
of
success
nothing
whatever
seemed
to
have
gone
wrong
with
it
except
that
tommy
failed
me
at
christmas
he
was
to
have
spent
a
week
but
wired
me
at
the
last
moment
that
he
could
not
leave
before
wednesday
and
then
when
he
came
stayed
only
until
saturday
he
had
something
to
say
about
the
pressure
of
the
holiday
trade
in
neckties
and
cuff
links
such
as
the
ladies
of
higgleston
habitually
invested
in
on
behalf
of
their
masculine
members
and
all
the
time
he
was
with
me
wore
that
efflorescence
of
appreciation
which
i
have
long
since
learned
to
recognize
as
the
overt
sign
of
male
delinquency
if
i
thought
of
it
at
all
in
that
connection
it
was
clean
swept
out
of
my
mind
by
meeting
early
in
january
with
eversley
and
hearing
him
first
apply
to
myself
that
phrase
which
i
have
chosen
for
the
title
to
this
writing
mark
eversley
the
greatest
modern
actor
so
we
all
believed
he
had
been
an
old
friend
of
harding
they
had
had
their
young
struggles
together
we
crowded
around
our
manager
to
hear
him
tell
of
them
struggles
which
in
so
far
as
they
identified
themselves
with
our
own
seemed
to
bring
us
by
implication
within
reach
of
his
present
fame
eversley
played
in
louis
while
we
were
there
and
having
an
evening
to
spare
in
spite
of
all
the
eager
social
appeal
chose
to
spend
it
with
the
hardings
they
had
had
dinner
together
and
as
harding
did
not
come
on
until
the
second
act
the
great
tragedian
sat
with
him
in
his
dressing
room
visiting
together
between
the
cues
like
two
boys
in
a
dormitory
that
was
how
eversley
happened
to
be
standing
in
the
wings
in
my
great
third
act
and
as
i
came
out
between
gusts
of
applause
after
it
he
was
very
kind
to
me
you
will
go
far
little
lady
said
he
his
lean
face
alive
with
kindliness
you
will
go
farther
and
have
to
come
back
and
pick
up
some
dropped
stitches
but
in
the
end
you
will
get
where
you
are
bound
it
was
not
for
me
to
tell
him
how
the
mere
consciousness
of
his
presence
had
carried
me
that
night
to
the
utmost
pitch
of
my
capacity
i
stood
and
blushed
with
confusion
while
he
fumbled
for
his
card
i
will
hear
of
you
again
he
said
i
am
bound
to
hear
of
you
in
the
meantime
here
is
my
permanent
address
it
may
be
that
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
when
you
come
to
the
bad
places
oh
said
harding
whose
failure
to
win
any
conspicuous
distinction
for
herself
had
not
embittered
her
she
seems
to
have
cleared
most
of
the
hard
places
at
a
bound
my
dear
young
lady
eversley
appealed
to
me
with
a
charming
whimsicality
whatever
you
do
do
let
them
put
that
into
your
head
you
will
indeed
need
me
if
you
get
to
thinking
that
you
are
i
suspect
a
woman
of
genius
and
in
that
case
there
will
always
be
bad
places
ahead
of
you
you
are
doomed
you
are
driven
they
will
never
let
up
on
you
well
he
should
know
he
was
a
man
of
genius
i
hope
it
might
be
true
about
me
but
i
was
afraid
for
to
be
a
genius
is
no
such
vanity
as
you
imagine
it
is
to
know
great
desires
and
to
have
no
will
of
your
own
toward
fulfilment
it
is
to
feed
others
yourself
unfed
it
is
to
be
broken
and
plied
as
the
powers
determine
it
is
to
serve
and
to
serve
and
to
get
nothing
out
of
it
beyond
the
joy
of
serving
and
to
know
if
you
have
done
that
acceptably
you
have
to
depend
on
the
plaudits
of
the
crowd
the
powers
give
no
sign
many
have
died
not
knowing
there
is
no
more
vanity
in
calling
yourself
a
woman
of
genius
if
you
know
what
genius
means
than
might
be
premised
of
one
of
the
guinea
pigs
set
aside
for
experimentation
in
a
laboratory
but
the
guinea
pigs
who
run
free
in
the
garden
impute
it
to
us
i
wrote
my
mother
and
tommy
what
eversley
had
said
but
i
knew
they
would
see
nothing
more
in
it
than
that
he
had
paid
me
a
compliment
which
it
would
not
be
modest
to
make
much
of
in
public
the
successes
of
that
year
prolonged
the
season
by
a
month
and
by
the
time
i
got
home
to
higgleston
the
leaves
were
all
out
on
the
maples
and
the
wide
old
yards
smelled
of
syringa
i
came
back
to
it
full
of
the
love
of
the
world
alive
in
every
fibre
of
my
being
and
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
it
caused
my
husband
some
embarrassment
there
was
a
shyness
in
his
resumption
of
our
relations
more
than
could
be
accounted
for
by
the
native
taylorvillian
gaucheries
of
emotion
my
dear
i
protested
you
do
seem
a
bit
glad
to
see
me
you
are
away
so
much
he
excused
you
getting
to
seem
almost
a
stranger
getting
i
should
say
i
am
this
morning
it
seemed
to
me
almost
as
if
i
waked
up
in
another
woman
house
i
meant
no
more
than
to
suggest
how
little
the
walls
of
it
the
furniture
the
draperies
expressed
my
new
mood
of
creative
power
but
suddenly
i
saw
my
husband
colour
a
deep
embarrassed
red
you
never
did
take
any
interest
in
our
life
here
in
the
business
in
me
he
seemed
to
be
making
out
a
case
against
me
do
say
in
you
tommy
but
the
life
here
yes
there
is
so
little
to
it
another
year
and
harding
says
i
could
hope
to
stay
in
chicago
my
husband
pushed
away
his
plate
we
were
at
breakfast
the
second
morning
higgleston
good
enough
for
me
he
protested
he
got
up
and
stood
at
the
window
with
his
back
to
me
looking
out
at
the
side
street
and
the
tardy
traffic
of
the
town
beginning
to
stir
in
it
when
you
hate
it
so
he
said
i
wonder
you
come
back
to
it
but
my
mood
was
proof
against
even
this
oh
thomas
thomas
i
got
my
hands
about
his
arm
and
snuggled
my
head
against
it
and
you
ca
even
guess
why
i
come
back
he
looked
at
me
vaguely
troubled
by
the
caress
but
not
responding
to
it
do
you
care
so
much
ever
and
ever
so
i
thought
he
was
in
need
of
reassurance
i
hardly
know
when
i
began
to
get
an
inkling
of
what
was
wrong
with
him
it
trickled
coldly
to
me
from
dropped
words
inflections
sidelong
glances
whenever
i
went
out
i
was
aware
of
all
higgleston
watching
watching
like
a
cat
at
a
for
something
to
come
out
what
reports
of
my
success
had
reached
them
through
the
papers
were
they
looking
for
some
endemic
impropriety
to
break
out
on
me
as
a
witness
to
what
a
popular
actress
must
inevitably
become
by
degrees
it
worked
through
to
me
that
all
higgleston
knew
things
about
my
situation
that
were
held
from
me
what
they
expected
to
see
come
out
in
my
behaviour
was
the
stripe
of
chastisement
when
i
had
been
at
home
four
or
five
days
it
occurred
to
me
miss
rathbone
had
not
yet
run
in
to
see
me
with
that
which
had
grown
out
of
the
business
association
of
our
men
old
rathbone
had
said
that
she
had
the
trousseau
of
one
of
the
harvey
girls
in
hand
but
i
knew
that
if
the
courtesy
had
been
due
from
me
i
could
have
neglected
it
without
the
risk
of
being
thought
what
miss
rathbone
herself
would
have
called
uppish
so
the
very
next
afternoon
having
fallen
in
with
some
higgleston
ladies
strolling
the
long
street
that
led
through
the
town
from
countryside
to
countryside
passing
her
gate
it
struck
me
that
here
was
an
excellent
opportunity
to
run
in
and
exchange
a
greeting
with
her
i
said
as
much
to
ross
and
harvey
as
i
swung
the
picket
gate
out
across
the
board
walk
there
was
something
in
their
way
of
standing
back
from
it
that
gave
them
the
air
of
sheering
off
from
any
implication
in
the
incident
they
looked
at
the
sidewalk
and
their
lips
were
a
little
drawn
i
should
have
known
that
look
very
well
by
that
time
i
threw
out
against
it
just
that
degree
of
impalpable
resistance
that
was
demanded
by
my
official
relation
to
the
women
of
my
husband
business
partner
and
clinched
it
with
the
click
of
the
gate
swinging
to
behind
me
but
as
i
went
up
the
walk
i
wondered
what
miss
rathbone
would
possibly
have
done
to
get
herself
talked
about
i
was
let
into
the
workroom
by
tillie
hemingway
in
the
character
of
a
baster
with
her
mouth
full
of
threads
miss
rathbone
came
hurrying
from
a
fitting
and
in
the
brief
moment
of
crossing
my
half
of
the
room
to
meet
her
i
was
aware
that
she
had
turned
a
sickly
hue
of
fear
she
must
have
seen
me
coming
up
the
street
with
the
other
women
i
surmised
and
guessed
that
i
knew
i
felt
a
kind
of
compulsion
on
me
to
assure
her
by
an
extra
graciousness
that
i
did
not
know
and
that
it
would
make
any
difference
if
i
did
she
was
not
changed
at
all
except
perhaps
as
to
a
trifle
more
abundance
of
bosom
and
a
greater
insensibility
to
the
pins
with
which
she
bristled
there
was
the
same
effect
of
modishness
in
the
blond
coiffure
with
the
rats
showing
and
the
well
cut
gown
but
she
seemed
to
know
so
little
what
to
do
with
my
visit
that
i
was
glad
to
cut
it
short
and
get
away
into
the
wide
overflowing
day
i
went
on
under
the
maples
in
leafage
full
and
tender
following
the
faint
scent
of
the
first
cutting
of
the
meadows
quite
to
the
end
of
the
village
and
a
mile
or
two
into
the
country
road
feeling
the
working
of
the
creative
powers
in
me
much
as
it
seemed
the
sentiment
earth
must
feel
the
summer
a
warm
benignant
process
i
was
at
one
with
the
soul
of
things
and
knew
myself
fruitful
at
last
when
the
dust
of
the
roadway
disturbed
by
the
homing
teams
collected
in
layers
of
the
cooler
air
and
the
bats
were
beginning
i
tore
myself
away
from
the
fair
day
as
from
a
lover
and
went
back
to
tommy
waiting
patiently
for
his
supper
while
i
was
getting
it
on
the
table
i
recalled
miss
rathbone
what
i
said
has
she
been
doing
to
get
herself
talked
about
suddenly
there
whipped
out
on
his
face
the
counterpart
of
the
flinching
which
i
had
noted
in
the
dressmaker
who
said
she
had
been
talked
about
what
have
they
been
telling
you
a
pack
of
lying
old
cats
so
she
been
talked
about
i
put
down
a
pile
of
plates
the
better
to
account
to
myself
for
his
excitement
i
might
have
known
somebody
would
get
at
you
why
ca
they
come
to
me
tommy
has
miss
rathbone
been
talked
about
with
oh
my
dear
i
meant
it
for
commiseration
tommy
went
sullen
all
at
once
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it
i
wo
talk
about
it
you
need
and
as
for
what
the
others
say
you
do
suppose
i
am
going
to
believe
it
he
turned
visibly
sick
at
the
assurance
i
tell
you
about
it
after
supper
he
protested
i
meant
to
tell
you
i
kept
my
mind
turned
deliberately
away
from
the
subject
until
it
was
night
and
i
heard
the
last
tardy
customer
depart
then
the
shutters
go
up
and
after
a
considerable
interval
my
husband
foot
upon
the
stairs
i
hope
i
have
made
you
understand
how
good
he
was
with
what
simple
sort
of
goodness
not
meant
to
stand
the
strain
of
the
complexity
in
which
he
found
himself
he
wanted
desperately
to
get
out
of
it
to
get
in
touch
again
with
straight
and
simple
lines
of
living
as
he
stood
before
me
then
his
face
was
streaked
red
and
white
with
the
stress
of
the
situation
like
a
man
after
a
great
bodily
exertion
i
was
moved
suddenly
to
spare
him
after
all
what
was
the
village
dressmaker
to
us
tommy
flared
out
at
me
she
is
as
good
as
you
are
she
as
pure
as
as
much
your
fault
as
anybody
you
were
away
you
were
always
away
his
voice
trailed
out
into
extenuation
there
fell
a
long
pause
in
which
several
things
became
clear
to
me
tell
me
i
said
at
last
tommy
sat
down
on
the
red
plush
couch
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
downstairs
for
the
evening
was
warm
there
was
pink
in
his
necktie
and
the
freckles
stood
out
across
his
nose
i
was
taken
with
a
wild
sense
of
the
ridiculous
miss
rathbone
i
knew
was
six
years
my
senior
i
went
there
a
good
deal
last
winter
he
began
i
never
meant
any
harm
my
business
partner
it
was
lonesome
here
of
course
i
ought
to
have
known
people
would
talk
nobody
told
me
she
was
brave
she
bore
it
a
long
time
and
then
i
saw
that
something
was
the
matter
i
know
until
she
told
me
how
fond
of
her
i
was
tommy
tommy
strangely
it
was
i
crying
out
fond
of
her
fond
of
i
was
fond
of
her
he
insisted
dully
she
suffered
a
lot
on
account
of
me
the
words
dropped
to
me
through
immeasurable
cold
space
i
believe
there
were
more
explanations
excusings
i
was
aware
of
being
wounded
in
some
far
unreachable
place
i
sat
stunned
and
watched
the
widening
rings
of
pain
and
amazement
spread
toward
me
by
and
by
tears
came
i
cried
long
and
quietly
i
got
down
on
the
floor
at
my
knees
and
put
my
arms
about
his
body
crying
after
a
time
i
remember
his
helping
me
to
undress
and
we
got
into
bed
we
had
but
the
one
i
know
it
now
for
the
sign
that
i
never
loved
my
husband
as
wives
should
love
that
i
felt
no
offence
in
this
sex
jealousy
was
not
awake
in
me
we
lay
in
bed
with
our
arms
around
one
another
and
cried
for
the
pain
and
bewilderment
of
what
had
happened
to
us
chapter
x
as
if
the
attraction
miss
rathbone
had
for
my
husband
had
been
a
spell
the
mere
naming
of
which
dissipated
it
we
spent
the
ensuing
three
or
four
days
in
the
glow
of
renewal
it
was
miss
rathbone
herself
who
drew
us
out
of
that
excluding
intimacy
set
us
apart
where
we
could
feel
the
cold
stiffness
of
our
hurts
and
the
injury
we
had
inflicted
each
on
the
other
whatever
there
had
been
between
them
and
i
never
knew
very
clearly
what
they
had
failed
to
reckon
on
the
recrudescence
of
the
interest
i
had
always
had
for
my
husband
and
the
tie
of
association
at
any
rate
miss
rathbone
failed
i
must
suppose
that
she
loved
tommy
that
she
was
hungering
for
the
sight
of
him
needing
desperately
to
feel
again
the
pressure
of
whatever
bond
had
been
between
them
she
came
into
the
store
on
the
fourth
evening
after
my
husband
admission
of
it
on
one
of
the
excuses
she
could
so
easily
make
out
of
her
father
being
there
i
was
sitting
upstairs
with
some
sewing
when
she
came
and
neither
saw
nor
heard
her
but
the
unslumbering
instinct
before
i
was
half
aware
of
it
had
drawn
me
to
the
head
of
the
stair
as
i
came
down
it
still
in
the
shadow
of
the
upper
landing
i
saw
her
leaning
across
the
counter
with
that
factious
air
of
modishness
which
was
so
large
a
part
of
her
stock
in
trade
with
higgleston
she
had
on
all
her
newest
things
and
i
think
she
was
rouged
a
little
even
with
the
width
of
the
counter
between
them
she
had
the
effect
of
enveloping
my
husband
with
that
manner
of
hers
as
with
a
net
to
set
up
in
him
the
illusion
of
all
that
i
was
in
fact
mystery
passion
the
air
of
the
great
world
i
was
pierced
through
with
the
realization
that
with
men
it
is
not
so
much
being
that
counts
as
seeming
there
was
a
touch
of
the
fatuous
in
the
way
tommy
submitted
to
the
implication
of
her
attitude
as
she
took
a
flower
from
her
breast
and
pinned
it
in
his
coat
the
foot
of
the
stair
came
almost
to
the
end
of
the
counter
where
they
stood
and
a
trick
of
the
light
falling
from
the
hanging
lamp
threw
the
upper
half
of
it
in
shadow
i
stood
just
within
it
with
my
hand
upon
the
rail
something
in
the
avidity
of
yielding
in
my
husband
manner
was
like
a
call
in
me
i
moved
involuntarily
a
step
downward
they
heard
and
then
they
saw
me
they
stopped
frozen
in
their
places
and
the
thing
that
froze
them
was
the
consciousness
of
guilt
they
stood
confessed
of
a
disloyalty
i
turned
full
in
their
sight
and
walked
back
up
the
stair
it
was
very
late
that
night
when
tommy
came
up
to
me
if
that
is
going
on
in
the
house
i
notified
him
you
ca
expect
me
to
stay
i
dare
say
you
be
glad
of
a
chance
to
leave
is
that
why
you
are
offering
it
to
me
it
was
by
such
degrees
we
covered
the
distance
between
our
situation
and
the
open
question
of
divorce
but
there
were
lapses
of
tenderness
and
turning
back
upon
the
trail
i
do
want
anybody
but
you
olivia
tommy
would
protest
if
you
would
only
stay
with
me
oh
tommy
if
you
would
only
come
away
with
me
if
either
of
these
things
had
been
possible
for
us
i
think
tommy
would
have
recovered
from
his
infatuation
and
been
the
happier
for
it
or
even
if
miss
rathbone
had
kept
away
from
him
but
that
is
what
she
or
would
do
she
might
have
thought
that
by
being
seen
coming
in
and
out
of
the
store
she
could
stave
off
criticism
by
the
appearance
of
being
on
good
terms
with
us
at
any
rate
she
came
i
think
her
coming
caused
my
husband
some
embarrassment
and
manlike
he
made
her
pay
for
it
as
i
think
of
it
now
i
realize
that
i
really
did
not
know
what
went
on
in
her
whether
she
had
set
a
trap
for
my
husband
or
yielded
to
an
unconquerable
passion
in
any
case
she
had
imagination
enough
to
see
that
unless
she
could
maintain
the
tragic
status
she
cut
rather
a
ridiculous
figure
sometimes
i
think
people
are
drawn
into
these
affairs
not
so
much
by
the
hope
of
happiness
as
the
need
the
desperate
need
of
emotion
any
kind
of
emotion
i
think
if
we
had
taken
her
note
had
had
it
out
on
the
basis
she
would
have
been
almost
as
well
satisfied
by
a
recognized
romantic
loss
as
by
success
but
i
never
knew
exactly
she
was
equally
in
the
dark
about
me
now
and
then
i
had
a
glimpse
of
the
figure
i
was
in
her
eyes
in
some
stricture
of
my
husband
on
my
behaviour
some
criticism
which
bore
the
stamp
of
her
suggestion
it
was
as
if
he
was
being
dragged
from
me
by
an
invisible
creature
of
which
i
knew
nothing
but
an
occasional
scraping
of
its
claws
i
try
to
do
her
the
justice
in
my
mind
of
thinking
that
the
situation
which
she
had
built
up
out
of
tommy
loneliness
was
as
real
for
her
as
it
was
for
him
nobody
in
higgleston
had
ever
taken
my
natural
alienation
from
the
people
there
as
anything
but
deliberate
and
despising
to
her
my
husband
was
the
victim
of
a
cold
neglectful
wife
and
to
him
she
contrived
to
be
a
figure
of
romance
i
owe
her
a
lot
tommy
insisted
she
has
suffered
on
account
of
me
he
went
back
to
that
phrase
again
i
owe
her
a
lot
what
do
you
owe
her
that
you
ca
pay
well
i
could
marry
as
long
as
you
you
want
to
marry
her
i
cried
you
want
to
marry
i
could
expect
you
to
appreciate
her
tommy
was
sullen
again
you
so
full
of
yourself
i
held
on
to
a
graver
matter
you
want
us
to
be
divorced
i
can
hear
that
sounding
hollowly
in
a
great
space
out
of
which
all
other
interests
in
life
seemed
suddenly
to
shrink
and
shrivel
i
had
learned
to
talk
of
divorce
in
the
great
world
but
to
me
my
marriage
was
one
of
the
incontrovertible
things
we
might
as
well
be
i
heard
my
husband
say
you
are
never
at
home
any
more
then
the
reaction
set
in
stay
with
me
olivia
i
do
want
anybody
but
you
just
stay
with
me
you
want
me
to
give
up
the
stage
and
live
here
in
higgleston
the
unfairness
of
this
overcame
me
well
why
not
if
you
married
to
me
i
believe
he
would
have
done
it
he
would
have
wasted
me
like
that
and
thought
little
of
it
i
was
married
and
not
altogether
to
tommy
but
to
higgleston
and
the
clothing
business
the
condition
he
demanded
of
me
was
not
of
loving
and
being
faithful
but
of
living
over
the
store
until
now
though
i
knew
i
did
not
love
my
husband
as
life
had
taught
me
men
could
be
loved
i
had
never
given
up
expecting
to
somewhere
somehow
but
i
was
certain
it
was
not
in
higgleston
the
transmuting
touch
should
find
him
which
would
turn
my
husband
into
the
lord
of
life
now
i
discovered
myself
pulled
over
into
another
point
of
view
he
had
become
a
man
capable
of
being
interested
in
the
village
dressmaker
the
farther
she
drew
him
from
me
the
more
the
stripe
of
higgleston
came
out
in
him
i
had
planned
to
go
up
to
chicago
for
a
week
in
august
to
consult
with
harding
about
the
plays
he
was
to
produce
the
next
season
i
had
not
signed
with
him
yet
but
i
knew
that
i
should
that
i
could
no
more
dissever
myself
from
that
connection
than
i
could
voluntarily
surrender
my
own
breath
i
might
try
but
after
the
few
respirations
withheld
nature
would
have
her
way
with
me
it
was
not
that
i
came
to
a
decision
about
it
the
whole
matter
appeared
to
lie
in
that
region
of
finality
that
made
the
assumption
of
a
decision
ridiculous
i
do
not
know
if
i
expected
to
divorce
my
husband
or
if
he
or
miss
rathbone
expected
it
i
think
we
were
all
a
little
scared
by
the
situation
we
had
evoked
as
children
might
be
at
a
dog
they
let
loose
we
felt
the
shames
of
publicity
yelping
at
our
heels
the
day
before
i
left
i
went
to
see
miss
rathbone
i
had
to
have
a
skirt
shortened
it
was
absurd
of
course
but
there
was
really
no
one
else
to
go
to
if
there
had
been
i
should
have
dared
all
higgleston
would
have
known
of
it
and
drawn
its
own
conclusion
as
it
was
higgleston
was
extremely
dissatisfied
with
the
affair
it
did
not
know
whom
properly
to
blame
me
for
neglecting
my
husband
or
miss
rathbone
for
snapping
him
up
they
felt
balked
of
the
moral
conclusion
i
hardly
know
what
miss
rathbone
thought
of
my
coming
to
her
i
think
she
had
braved
herself
for
some
sort
of
emotional
struggle
sharp
enough
to
drown
the
whisper
of
reprobation
my
quiet
acceptance
of
the
situation
left
her
somehow
toppling
over
her
own
defences
sometimes
i
think
the
emotionalism
which
the
attitude
of
that
time
demanded
to
be
worked
up
over
a
divorce
drew
people
to
it
with
that
impulse
which
leads
them
to
rush
toward
a
fire
or
hurl
themselves
from
precipices
miss
rathbone
must
have
been
aching
to
fling
out
at
me
to
justify
her
own
position
by
abuse
of
mine
and
here
she
was
down
on
the
floor
with
her
mouth
full
of
pins
squinting
at
the
line
of
my
skirt
it
was
then
that
i
told
her
what
i
was
going
to
chicago
for
you
be
away
from
home
all
winter
then
the
question
was
a
challenge
i
do
know
i
have
signed
yet
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
have
foreborne
that
it
was
exactly
the
kind
of
an
advantage
she
would
have
taken
of
me
if
i
chose
not
to
sign
for
the
next
winter
where
was
she
she
stood
up
blindly
at
last
i
guess
i
can
do
the
rest
without
you
she
said
some
latent
instinct
of
fairness
flashed
up
in
me
but
i
think
i
shall
sign
i
admitted
i
could
stand
a
winter
in
higgleston
i
was
glad
afterward
that
i
had
said
that
it
gave
her
leave
for
the
brief
time
that
was
left
to
them
to
think
of
him
as
being
given
into
her
hands
i
was
greatly
relieved
to
get
away
even
for
a
week
from
the
cold
curiosity
of
higgleston
which
without
saying
so
had
made
me
perfectly
aware
that
i
showed
i
had
been
crying
a
great
deal
lately
but
no
sooner
was
i
freed
from
the
pull
of
affection
than
i
began
to
feel
a
deep
resentment
against
tommy
his
attempt
to
charge
his
lapse
of
loyalty
on
my
art
on
that
thing
in
me
which
as
i
read
it
constituted
my
sole
claim
upon
consideration
appeared
a
deeper
indignity
than
his
interest
in
the
dressmaker
it
was
all
a
part
of
that
revelation
which
sears
the
path
of
the
gifted
woman
as
with
a
flame
that
no
matter
what
her
value
to
society
no
man
will
spare
her
anything
except
as
she
pleases
him
at
the
first
summer
heat
of
it
i
felt
my
soul
curl
at
the
edges
his
repudiation
of
me
as
an
actress
began
to
appear
a
slight
upon
all
that
world
of
fineness
which
art
upholds
a
thing
not
to
be
tolerated
by
any
citizen
of
it
in
its
last
analysis
it
seemed
that
my
husband
had
deserted
me
in
favour
of
higgleston
quite
as
much
as
i
had
deserted
him
and
it
was
for
me
to
say
whether
i
should
consent
to
it
in
that
mood
i
met
harding
and
signed
with
him
for
the
ensuing
season
and
then
quite
unaccountably
ten
days
before
i
was
expected
i
found
myself
pulled
back
to
higgleston
i
had
wired
tommy
and
was
surprised
to
have
ross
meet
me
at
the
station
bettersworth
is
not
very
well
he
explained
as
he
put
me
into
higgleston
one
omnibus
it
came
on
him
rather
suddenly
some
kind
of
a
seizure
he
admitted
though
i
did
not
gather
from
his
manner
that
it
was
particularly
serious
until
the
instead
of
stopping
at
our
store
drove
straight
on
up
the
one
wide
street
i
thought
you
want
to
see
him
immediately
the
attorney
interposed
to
my
arresting
gesture
you
see
he
was
taken
at
his
partner
house
he
seemed
to
avoid
some
unpleasant
implication
by
not
mentioning
rathbone
name
i
scarcely
remember
what
other
particulars
he
gave
me
at
the
time
my
next
sharp
impression
was
of
my
husband
lying
white
and
breathing
heavily
in
the
bed
in
the
rathbone
front
room
the
drapery
of
which
had
been
torn
hastily
down
to
make
room
for
him
regardless
of
the
finished
pieces
of
miss
harvey
trousseau
still
crowding
the
chairs
upon
which
they
had
been
hastily
thrust
empty
sleeves
hung
down
and
vaguely
seemed
to
reach
for
what
they
could
not
clasp
strangely
i
was
aware
in
them
of
an
aching
lack
and
loss
which
must
have
sprung
in
my
bosom
i
took
my
husband
hand
and
it
dropped
back
from
my
clasp
waxlike
and
nerveless
i
think
i
had
been
kneeling
by
the
bed
for
some
time
talk
had
been
going
on
whisperingly
around
me
finally
the
light
faded
and
i
discovered
that
the
doctor
had
gone
the
beribboned
bridal
garments
hung
limply
still
on
the
chairs
and
mocked
me
with
their
empty
arms
presently
i
was
aware
that
miss
rathbone
had
come
in
with
a
lamp
she
stood
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
and
we
looked
at
him
and
at
one
another
how
long
i
asked
her
two
or
three
days
maybe
the
doctor
says
will
he
know
me
again
the
doctor
says
not
oh
tommy
tommy
i
began
to
shake
with
suppressed
sobbing
miss
rathbone
looked
at
me
with
cold
resentment
you
can
cry
as
much
as
you
like
it
wo
disturb
him
she
said
she
seemed
to
have
taken
the
fact
that
she
was
to
cry
herself
as
final
in
a
few
minutes
old
rathbone
shuffled
in
from
the
shop
and
stood
peering
at
tommy
with
his
little
eyes
wiping
them
furtively
i
believe
the
old
man
was
fond
of
his
partner
and
it
was
not
strange
to
him
that
tommy
should
be
lying
ill
at
his
home
miss
rathbone
came
and
took
him
by
the
shoulders
as
one
does
to
a
grieving
child
and
turned
his
face
to
her
bosom
she
was
a
head
taller
than
he
and
as
she
looked
across
him
to
me
there
was
compulsion
in
her
look
and
pleading
he
is
never
to
know
the
look
said
and
i
looked
back
never
it
was
then
that
i
realized
how
genuine
her
affection
was
for
the
feeble
snuffling
old
man
she
would
suffer
at
being
lessened
in
his
eyes
some
one
came
and
took
me
away
for
a
while
and
by
degrees
i
got
to
know
the
story
it
had
been
the
night
before
just
about
the
time
i
was
taken
with
that
strange
impulse
to
return
that
tommy
had
shut
up
the
store
and
gone
over
to
the
room
belonging
to
the
board
of
trade
which
had
become
a
sort
of
club
for
the
soberer
men
of
the
community
a
great
deal
of
talk
went
on
there
which
gave
them
the
agreeable
impression
of
something
being
done
though
there
must
have
been
much
of
it
of
the
character
of
that
which
was
going
on
in
a
group
around
montague
when
tommy
came
in
at
the
door
he
came
in
very
quietly
blinded
by
the
light
and
they
had
their
backs
to
him
shaking
with
the
loose
laughter
which
punctuates
a
ribald
description
then
voice
took
it
up
again
rathbone
get
him
he
said
she
got
the
goods
the
other
one
has
probably
got
somebody
on
the
side
these
actresses
are
all
alike
there
was
a
word
or
two
more
to
that
before
tommy
fist
in
his
jaw
stopped
him
montague
struck
back
he
was
a
heavier
man
than
my
husband
but
in
a
minute
the
others
had
rushed
in
between
them
they
were
drawn
back
and
held
tommy
nose
bled
profusely
he
appeared
dazed
and
accepted
montague
forced
apology
without
a
word
the
men
were
all
scared
and
yet
excited
some
of
them
were
ashamed
of
themselves
they
suspected
it
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
should
go
on
at
a
board
of
trade
and
agreed
it
ought
to
be
kept
out
of
the
papers
some
one
walked
home
with
my
husband
and
on
the
way
he
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
vomiting
who
was
it
hit
me
he
asked
at
the
door
and
seemed
but
vaguely
to
remember
what
it
was
about
the
next
morning
he
opened
the
store
as
usual
and
appeared
quite
himself
to
old
rathbone
who
came
shuffling
and
sidestepping
in
to
his
nest
at
the
accustomed
hour
about
ten
the
tailor
was
made
aware
by
the
rapping
of
a
customer
on
the
deserted
counter
that
tommy
had
gone
out
without
a
word
he
must
have
gone
straight
to
miss
rathbone
those
who
met
him
on
the
street
recalled
that
his
gait
was
unsteady
she
must
have
been
greatly
concerned
to
have
him
there
at
that
hour
for
people
were
moving
about
the
streets
and
customers
beginning
to
come
in
and
in
the
presence
of
tillie
hemingway
he
could
offer
her
no
adequate
explanation
she
was
desperately
revolving
the
risk
of
taking
him
into
the
front
room
to
have
out
of
him
what
his
distrait
presence
half
declared
when
he
was
taken
with
a
momentary
retching
she
went
into
the
next
room
to
fetch
him
a
glass
of
water
and
a
moment
after
her
back
was
turned
she
heard
him
pitch
forward
on
the
floor
when
rathbone
had
sent
for
me
by
the
wire
that
passed
me
on
the
way
home
he
sent
also
to
tommy
father
who
got
in
before
noon
the
next
day
i
remember
him
as
a
quizzical
sort
of
man
always
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
bristling
brown
moustache
cut
off
square
with
his
upper
lip
and
a
better
understanding
of
the
situation
than
he
had
any
intention
of
admitting
i
had
by
some
unconscious
means
derived
from
him
that
though
he
was
fond
of
tommy
he
never
had
much
opinion
of
his
capacity
i
think
now
it
must
have
been
his
presence
there
and
his
manner
of
being
likely
to
do
the
most
unexpected
thing
that
pulled
those
same
live
business
men
who
had
stood
listening
in
relish
of
monty
ribaldry
out
of
the
possibility
of
entertainment
in
the
case
that
might
be
made
out
of
his
implication
in
my
death
to
the
consideration
of
the
town
repute
as
a
place
where
such
things
could
not
possibly
happen
by
the
time
forester
came
on
a
covert
discretion
had
supplied
the
event
with
its
sole
consoling
circumstance
of
secrecy
not
even
my
family
got
to
know
what
led
up
to
that
blow
which
had
precipitated
an
unsuspected
weakness
it
was
quite
in
accordance
with
what
they
believed
of
the
life
i
had
chosen
that
my
husband
death
in
a
brawl
should
be
among
its
contingencies
poor
tommy
end
took
on
a
tinge
of
theatricality
it
was
toward
the
end
of
the
second
day
that
he
began
to
respond
to
the
stimulants
the
doctor
had
been
pouring
into
him
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
us
conscious
but
out
of
all
present
time
feebly
his
glance
roved
over
the
figures
by
the
bed
and
fell
at
last
on
me
ollie
he
whispered
ollie
it
was
a
name
he
had
not
called
for
a
long
time
oh
my
dear
my
dear
i
took
his
hand
again
and
felt
a
faint
pressure
miss
rathbone
hardly
dared
to
look
at
him
with
the
others
standing
about
i
whispered
her
name
to
him
and
his
partner
but
he
did
not
so
much
as
turn
his
eyes
in
their
direction
i
could
see
him
studying
me
out
of
glances
there
would
be
an
appreciable
interval
before
the
sense
of
what
he
saw
penetrated
the
dulled
brain
i
thought
i
knew
the
very
moment
when
the
significance
of
our
standing
all
about
his
bed
crying
took
hold
of
him
all
at
once
he
spoke
out
clearly
is
my
father
here
i
fancied
he
must
have
hit
on
that
question
as
a
confirmation
but
before
there
could
be
any
talk
between
them
he
slid
off
again
into
the
deeps
of
insensibility
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
he
started
up
almost
strongly
ollie
he
demanded
where
is
the
baby
asleep
i
told
him
then
i
will
sleep
too
and
in
a
little
while
it
was
so
the
odd
fellows
took
charge
of
my
husband
funeral
his
body
was
moved
from
the
rathbones
to
their
hall
and
did
not
go
back
again
to
the
rooms
over
the
store
miss
rathbone
made
up
my
crape
for
me
i
believe
it
gave
her
a
little
comfort
to
do
so
forester
came
and
settled
up
my
husband
affairs
he
was
rather
inclined
to
resent
what
he
felt
was
an
effort
of
the
rathbones
to
claim
a
larger
share
in
the
business
than
the
books
showed
but
he
thought
my
indifference
natural
to
my
grief
he
was
shocked
a
little
at
my
determination
to
go
on
with
my
engagement
we
were
not
so
poor
he
thought
that
i
could
not
afford
a
little
retirement
to
my
widowhood
but
in
that
strange
renewal
of
communion
after
death
i
felt
my
husband
nearer
than
before
he
would
go
with
me
at
last
out
of
higgleston
strangely
i
wanted
to
see
miss
rathbone
but
she
kept
away
from
me
that
was
as
it
should
have
been
in
higgleston
she
had
tried
to
get
my
husband
she
had
been
in
a
way
the
death
of
him
it
was
hardly
expected
that
i
could
bear
the
sight
of
her
though
it
would
have
been
christian
to
forgive
her
i
did
see
her
however
the
night
before
i
went
away
it
was
the
dusk
of
the
first
of
september
there
was
a
moon
coming
up
large
and
dulled
at
the
edges
by
the
haze
and
that
strange
earthy
smell
with
the
hint
of
decay
in
it
kept
in
by
the
banded
mists
that
lay
below
the
moon
the
darkness
crept
close
along
the
earth
and
spread
upward
like
an
exhalation
into
the
sky
where
almost
the
full
day
halted
i
had
slipped
out
down
a
side
street
and
across
an
open
lot
to
the
cemetery
i
would
have
that
hour
with
my
dead
free
from
observation
i
went
between
the
white
head
stones
and
the
flower
borders
as
i
neared
my
husband
grave
something
moved
upon
it
it
arose
out
of
the
low
mound
as
i
approached
for
one
second
i
stopped
speechless
it
moved
again
and
showed
a
woman
miss
rathbone
i
called
henrietta
i
had
not
used
her
name
before
i
have
just
now
remembered
it
you
might
have
left
me
this
she
said
i
saw
that
she
had
covered
the
mound
with
flowers
and
i
was
glad
i
had
not
brought
any
i
am
leaving
i
answered
i
am
going
where
my
work
is
yes
can
go
but
i
have
to
stay
where
my
work
is
i
stay
with
him
you
can
go
you
always
wanted
to
go
and
i
i
have
been
talked
about
and
i
dare
even
cry
for
him
not
even
at
night
for
my
father
hears
me
she
was
crying
now
deeply
bitterly
you
never
cared
for
him
she
insisted
and
now
he
knows
it
he
knows
and
has
come
back
to
me
to
he
comes
back
i
admitted
i
was
stricken
suddenly
with
the
futility
of
all
human
conviction
moving
about
the
house
that
day
i
had
been
conscious
of
him
beside
me
then
and
now
lying
there
beside
my
boy
touching
him
mine
sealed
to
me
in
the
certainty
of
death
and
he
had
come
back
to
i
did
not
know
even
now
what
she
and
my
husband
had
been
to
one
another
it
swept
over
me
somehow
drowningly
that
this
was
the
secret
that
the
dead
know
how
to
belong
to
all
of
us
they
had
no
bond
how
could
they
be
unfaithful
for
a
moment
i
was
caught
up
by
the
thought
to
nobility
look
here
henrietta
if
you
feel
that
way
i
leave
it
to
you
not
come
here
any
more
i
did
not
know
what
else
i
could
do
about
it
it
the
least
you
do
she
was
accepting
it
as
her
right
any
woman
will
understand
how
i
wanted
to
lay
my
hand
there
above
his
breast
she
must
really
have
believed
i
did
not
love
him
i
turned
back
across
the
borders
henrietta
she
made
a
nearly
inarticulate
sound
the
last
i
saw
of
her
in
the
dusk
she
was
tucking
her
flowers
into
the
fresh
sod
as
one
tucks
a
coverlet
about
a
child
he
had
been
i
suppose
both
man
and
child
to
her
book
iii
chapter
i
i
have
to
take
up
my
story
again
about
eighteen
months
later
at
the
point
of
my
going
out
to
suburbia
to
ask
gerald
mcdermott
for
a
part
in
his
new
play
which
was
being
rehearsed
with
sarah
in
the
of
but
before
that
there
had
been
some
rather
mortifying
experiences
to
teach
me
that
though
i
was
done
with
higgleston
it
was
to
a
certainty
not
done
with
me
in
any
case
i
suppose
the
shock
of
my
husband
death
must
have
affected
my
work
unfavourably
but
the
knowledge
of
his
secret
defection
and
the
excuse
he
found
for
it
in
what
was
best
in
me
made
still
corroding
poison
at
the
bottom
of
my
wound
what
it
all
amounted
to
in
my
career
was
that
the
season
which
should
have
swept
me
back
to
chicago
in
triumphant
establishment
of
my
gift
trickled
out
in
faint
praise
and
cold
esteem
it
was
not
that
you
could
place
your
finger
and
say
just
there
was
the
difficulty
but
what
came
of
it
was
another
year
on
the
road
with
cline
and
erskine
in
stock
the
hardings
notwithstanding
their
disappointment
in
what
they
expected
to
make
of
me
managed
to
be
kind
you
pull
up
they
assured
me
it
because
you
are
really
an
artist
that
you
show
what
you
been
through
and
they
did
know
the
half
of
what
that
was
to
henry
mills
my
engagement
with
cline
and
erskine
was
a
step
forward
into
that
blazoned
and
banal
professionalism
which
passes
in
america
for
dramatic
success
but
sarah
knew
and
i
think
i
knew
myself
that
the
dance
they
led
us
in
the
spotlight
of
copious
advertisement
was
a
dance
of
death
to
much
that
the
plastic
art
should
be
in
this
instance
it
was
demonstrated
even
to
the
hopeful
eye
of
henry
mills
for
the
play
chosen
proved
so
little
suited
to
the
middle
west
cities
where
we
played
it
that
before
the
season
was
half
over
we
were
recalled
and
after
an
empty
interval
finished
out
the
engagement
in
one
of
those
sensation
mongering
shows
with
which
such
combinations
as
cline
and
erskine
clutch
at
the
fleeing
skirts
of
a
public
they
never
understand
it
was
about
a
month
after
the
closing
of
this
engagement
that
i
took
sarah
suggestion
about
applying
to
gerald
mcdermott
but
not
before
i
had
tried
several
other
things
the
truth
was
as
i
knew
very
well
when
i
faced
it
that
i
had
at
the
time
nothing
in
me
to
those
who
it
a
gift
is
a
sort
of
extra
possession
like
an
eye
or
a
hand
that
can
be
commanded
to
its
accustomed
trick
on
any
occasion
but
to
the
owners
of
it
it
is
a
libation
poured
to
the
unknown
god
i
had
emptied
my
cup
of
its
froth
of
youth
and
as
yet
nothing
had
touched
the
profounder
experience
from
which
it
should
be
fed
and
filled
again
and
i
had
no
technique
to
supply
the
insufficiencies
of
my
inspiration
somewhere
within
me
i
felt
the
stuff
of
power
stiff
and
unworkable
needing
the
flux
of
passion
and
the
shaping
hand
of
skill
looking
back
now
from
the
vantage
of
a
tolerable
success
if
you
were
to
ask
me
what
more
than
any
other
thing
prevents
the
fulness
of
our
native
art
i
should
say
the
blank
public
misapprehension
of
its
processes
turning
every
way
to
catch
the
favourable
wind
what
met
me
then
was
the
general
conviction
on
the
part
of
my
friends
that
if
you
had
talent
you
succeeded
anyway
and
if
you
were
succeeding
it
was
because
you
had
any
talent
i
suffered
many
humiliations
before
i
learned
how
absolutely
by
that
same
society
that
so
liberally
resents
the
implication
of
any
separateness
in
art
the
artist
is
thrust
back
upon
himself
to
do
what
seemed
necessary
for
the
development
of
my
gift
to
have
a
year
or
two
to
travel
and
study
to
connote
its
powers
with
its
limitations
required
money
and
though
there
in
chicago
there
was
money
for
every
sort
of
adventure
that
stirred
the
imagination
of
man
there
was
none
for
the
particular
sort
of
investment
i
represented
at
least
not
at
the
price
i
was
prepared
to
pay
the
half
of
what
had
been
put
into
setting
my
brother
on
his
feet
would
have
served
me
but
i
learned
from
effie
that
as
much
of
my
capital
as
had
been
put
into
forester
business
was
not
only
impossible
to
be
withdrawn
from
keeping
him
upright
but
threatened
not
to
hold
him
so
for
as
long
as
it
was
necessary
for
mother
to
see
in
him
the
figure
of
a
provider
this
had
been
made
plain
at
christmas
when
effie
had
written
me
that
a
particular
wheeled
chair
which
my
mother
had
set
her
heart
upon
because
of
a
hope
it
held
out
of
would
be
impossible
unless
i
came
forward
handsomely
i
did
come
forward
on
a
scale
commensurate
with
the
taylorville
estimate
of
my
salary
which
was
by
no
means
comparable
to
its
purchasing
power
in
chicago
and
now
i
was
beginning
to
realize
that
unless
some
one
came
forward
for
me
i
stood
to
lose
the
shining
destiny
to
which
i
felt
myself
appointed
i
was
slow
in
understanding
that
it
was
not
to
be
looked
for
by
any
of
the
paths
by
which
interest
and
succour
are
traditionally
due
not
for
instance
from
pauline
and
henry
mills
i
was
seeing
a
great
deal
of
them
since
i
had
come
to
chicago
not
only
because
of
our
earlier
friendship
but
because
i
found
myself
constantly
thrown
back
on
all
that
they
stood
for
by
my
distaste
for
much
that
i
saw
myself
implicated
in
as
a
theatrical
star
who
had
not
quite
made
good
i
hated
quite
unjustly
i
believe
the
players
with
whom
for
the
time
i
was
professionally
classed
i
loathed
the
shallow
shop
talk
the
makeshift
rooms
we
lived
in
the
outward
smartness
and
the
pinch
of
anxiety
it
covered
i
was
irritated
by
my
external
and
circumstantial
resemblance
to
much
that
i
felt
instinctively
kept
them
where
they
were
and
vexed
at
some
cheapness
in
myself
which
seemed
to
be
revealed
by
the
irritation
i
had
been
thrown
up
out
of
the
freemasonry
of
the
preliminary
struggle
into
a
kind
of
backwater
of
established
where
there
were
also
manners
and
morals
and
social
perceptions
it
was
a
great
relief
to
get
away
from
it
to
pauline
home
in
evanston
and
the
air
it
had
of
being
somehow
established
at
the
pivot
of
existence
pauline
had
two
children
by
now
and
a
manner
of
being
abundantly
equal
to
the
world
in
which
she
moved
a
manner
which
i
was
only
just
realizing
was
largely
owing
to
the
figure
of
her
husband
income
what
pauline
furnished
me
at
her
home
over
and
above
the
real
affection
there
was
still
between
us
was
a
sort
of
continuous
performance
of
the
domestic
virtues
that
faculty
for
knowing
exactly
what
she
wanted
which
had
led
her
to
make
the
most
of
her
housekeeping
allowance
in
the
days
when
making
the
most
of
it
was
her
chief
occupation
now
that
the
centres
of
her
activity
had
been
shifted
from
the
practical
to
the
social
and
cultural
stood
her
in
remarkable
stead
i
was
so
constantly
amazed
by
the
celerity
and
sureness
with
which
she
seized
on
just
the
attitude
or
opinion
which
suited
best
with
the
part
she
had
cast
herself
for
as
the
perfect
wife
and
mother
that
it
was
only
when
i
discovered
its
complete
want
of
relativity
to
the
purpose
of
the
play
or
to
the
rest
of
the
company
that
i
was
not
taken
in
by
it
i
doubt
now
if
pauline
ever
had
an
idea
or
permitted
herself
a
behaviour
which
was
not
conditioned
by
the
pattern
she
had
set
for
herself
which
she
intrigued
both
henry
and
myself
into
believing
was
the
only
real
and
appreciable
life
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
get
away
from
my
own
dreary
professionalism
to
the
nursery
at
evanston
or
to
add
my
small
flourish
to
the
à
of
henry
homecoming
made
every
day
to
seem
the
one
event
for
which
the
household
waited
from
which
indeed
it
took
its
excuse
for
being
for
all
of
this
was
so
well
in
line
with
what
henry
who
with
the
amplification
of
his
income
had
taken
on
a
due
rotundity
of
outline
and
a
slight
tendency
to
baldness
conceived
as
proper
for
a
man
home
to
be
that
he
played
up
to
it
as
much
as
was
in
him
he
had
still
his
air
of
knowingness
about
the
theatre
and
if
there
was
at
times
in
his
manner
a
suggestion
that
he
might
have
found
it
pleasanter
to
adjust
his
relation
to
me
on
the
basis
of
what
i
was
as
an
actress
if
i
had
not
been
quite
so
much
the
friend
it
was
so
far
modified
by
his
genuine
admiration
for
his
wife
and
his
cession
to
her
of
every
right
of
judgment
in
the
home
that
i
was
inclined
to
accept
him
at
his
own
and
pauline
estimate
as
the
model
husband
it
was
only
a
few
days
before
my
visit
to
gerald
mcdermott
that
i
had
undertaken
to
state
to
pauline
the
nature
of
the
help
i
required
and
my
title
to
it
i
had
gone
out
to
dinner
and
found
her
putting
on
a
new
gown
one
of
those
garments
admirably
contrived
between
the
smartness
of
evening
dress
and
the
intimacy
of
negligée
in
which
evanston
ladies
of
that
period
were
wont
to
receive
their
lords
i
needing
something
new
myself
i
said
for
a
beginning
and
divided
between
the
certainty
that
if
i
do
get
an
engagement
i
afford
it
and
if
i
do
afford
it
i
probably
wo
get
an
engagement
pauline
stopped
in
the
process
of
hooking
up
to
take
stock
of
me
you
absurd
child
the
note
of
amused
admonition
with
which
she
ordinarily
accepted
my
professional
exigencies
turned
on
the
note
of
correction
do
you
think
you
put
too
much
stress
on
those
things
what
things
she
had
touched
upon
the
spring
of
irritation
clothes
you
know
and
appearances
is
it
better
just
to
do
your
work
well
and
rest
upon
that
pauline
if
you
had
ever
looked
for
an
engagement
you
would
know
that
getting
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
appearing
equal
to
it
and
clothes
are
the
better
part
of
appearing
but
if
you
know
that
your
work
is
good
what
do
you
care
what
people
think
of
you
i
dodged
the
moral
situation
about
to
be
precipitated
on
me
it
about
the
only
way
you
know
it
is
good
knowing
what
people
think
of
it
now
see
here
pauline
protested
reinforced
by
the
evident
superiority
of
her
viewpoint
to
mine
you
getting
all
wrong
these
things
you
are
thinking
of
they
are
not
the
real
things
they
do
count
not
in
the
long
run
it
only
the
spiritual
things
that
really
matter
she
had
put
on
all
the
plastic
effect
of
nobility
that
was
part
of
her
stock
in
trade
with
henry
mills
i
thrust
out
against
it
sharply
do
you
realize
pauline
that
if
i
do
get
an
engagement
soon
i
sha
be
able
to
pay
my
board
oh
you
poor
dear
she
came
over
and
took
my
hand
i
do
know
why
women
like
pauline
do
that
but
when
they
do
it
it
is
a
sign
they
are
not
equal
to
the
situation
and
are
trying
to
fake
it
with
you
i
know
it
is
hard
she
found
the
cooing
note
with
facility
but
it
will
come
right
it
always
does
i
always
found
that
there
is
a
way
provided
something
flashed
into
my
mind
that
i
had
read
in
the
newspapers
recently
about
the
corporations
henry
worked
for
and
i
wondered
if
pauline
had
the
least
notion
how
the
way
for
her
was
humanly
provided
but
the
sound
of
henry
latchkey
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
which
i
had
felt
sufficiently
encouraging
to
warrant
my
taking
up
again
i
went
from
pauline
at
the
very
first
opportunity
to
sarah
croyden
who
was
playing
in
chicago
and
doing
her
kindliest
to
blow
the
wind
of
hope
into
my
sagging
sails
i
met
cecelia
brune
there
it
had
been
to
me
the
witness
of
how
far
i
had
fallen
from
my
mark
that
i
had
been
thrown
with
her
again
in
my
last
engagement
hers
was
the
sort
of
talent
that
cline
and
erskine
could
play
up
to
the
limit
of
the
inadmissible
there
were
not
wanting
intimations
that
cecelia
had
moved
her
own
limit
a
notch
or
two
in
that
direction
she
had
taken
a
characteristic
view
of
my
reappearance
in
her
neighbourhood
got
into
the
did
you
she
remarked
i
saw
dean
on
the
road
last
year
and
she
said
you
was
going
in
for
stunts
nothin
to
it
you
stay
with
cline
and
erskine
they
get
you
on
like
anything
her
own
notion
of
getting
on
was
to
figure
as
the
sole
female
attraction
in
a
song
and
dance
skit
in
what
she
pronounced
vawdville
it
the
only
place
havin
a
figgur
does
you
any
good
that
she
did
not
recommend
it
for
me
must
be
taken
for
her
estimate
of
mine
nevertheless
i
was
amused
by
her
and
sarah
i
knew
was
even
a
little
fond
sarah
affections
were
a
sort
of
natural
emanation
from
her
like
the
rays
of
a
candle
and
warmed
all
they
lighted
on
on
this
afternoon
i
found
cecelia
drinking
tea
there
and
i
was
able
to
conceal
my
professional
depression
from
her
sharp
shallow
inquisitiveness
there
were
never
two
or
three
players
got
together
i
believe
but
the
talk
turned
on
the
comparative
ineffectiveness
of
merit
as
against
pull
in
the
struggle
for
success
there
no
two
ways
about
it
insisted
cecelia
brune
you
got
ta
get
a
hold
of
some
rich
guy
and
freeze
to
him
the
extent
to
which
cecelia
had
blossomed
out
in
ostrich
tips
and
orchids
that
bright
spring
afternoon
might
have
suggested
to
an
experienced
eye
that
the
freezing
process
had
already
begun
i
say
might
have
because
sarah
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
disassociate
her
from
the
hard
grubby
innocence
in
which
our
acquaintance
had
begun
sarah
i
know
believed
in
her
and
had
her
in
often
to
informal
occasions
as
a
bulwark
against
what
with
all
her
faith
and
pains
she
did
finally
save
her
from
you
can
talk
all
you
want
to
cecelia
asseverated
about
man
being
the
natural
provider
i
noticed
he
do
work
at
the
job
much
without
he
gettin
something
out
of
it
if
you
sufferin
with
that
little
old
song
and
dance
about
men
doin
for
you
because
you
a
woman
and
need
it
you
got
ta
get
over
it
there
nothin
laid
down
over
that
counter
unless
you
deliver
the
goods
she
was
nibbling
lumps
of
sugar
moistened
in
her
tea
and
the
wild
rose
of
her
cheeks
and
the
distracting
rings
of
her
hair
made
her
offensiveness
a
mere
childish
impertinence
look
at
helen
matlock
she
ran
on
gettin
five
hundred
a
week
and
when
old
sedgwick
put
it
up
to
her
she
said
she
die
rather
and
then
she
went
home
and
found
her
mother
sick
and
what
did
she
do
never
batted
an
eye
but
told
her
she
got
an
engagement
and
went
back
and
made
it
good
an
now
she
gettin
five
hundred
that
what
i
call
doin
well
by
yourself
she
ca
mean
it
sarah
extenuated
when
cecelia
had
gone
she
too
frank
about
it
when
she
stops
talking
i
shall
begin
to
suspect
her
but
is
it
true
about
miss
matlock
i
mean
just
at
that
juncture
helen
matlock
was
doing
the
work
i
felt
most
drawn
to
most
fit
to
undertake
i
suppose
so
sarah
allowed
it
a
common
saying
that
the
way
to
the
footlights
in
the
majestic
is
through
the
manager
private
room
she
came
over
and
sat
beside
me
on
the
bed
which
under
a
bagdad
curtain
did
duty
as
a
couch
there
are
other
theatres
besides
the
majestic
she
said
none
that
want
me
i
averred
oh
she
cried
you
do
mean
no
i
had
to
own
i
do
mean
that
i
have
a
chance
to
get
on
even
by
misbehaving
myself
i
not
the
kind
to
whom
that
sort
of
chance
comes
sarah
stroked
my
hand
a
while
i
been
thinking
if
you
could
get
a
small
part
or
a
season
you
could
take
it
under
another
name
until
you
are
quite
yourself
again
it
often
done
i
could
see
she
had
gone
much
farther
than
that
with
it
in
her
thought
it
was
just
such
cover
as
that
i
was
seeking
for
the
renaissance
of
my
acting
power
and
that
was
what
led
to
my
going
out
to
suburbia
to
see
gerald
mcdermott
about
the
part
of
in
the
futurist
it
was
out
quite
in
the
frayed
edge
of
outer
fringe
of
real
estate
ventures
which
hedged
chicago
round
in
a
district
which
was
spoiled
for
country
and
not
quite
made
into
town
and
from
the
number
of
weedy
plots
not
built
upon
between
the
cottages
had
almost
a
rural
air
leaning
trolleys
went
zizzing
along
the
banked
highways
and
at
the
ends
of
the
unpaved
avenues
there
were
flat
gleams
of
the
lake
depressed
as
i
was
by
the
consciousness
of
having
fallen
from
the
estate
of
actresses
who
command
engagements
to
those
who
seek
them
i
was
still
able
to
be
touched
a
little
by
curiosity
by
what
sarah
had
told
me
of
mcdermott
and
his
wife
whom
he
had
married
for
her
pretty
feminine
inconsequence
who
having
no
point
of
attachment
to
her
husband
life
but
femininity
was
able
to
imagine
none
for
any
other
woman
and
suffered
incredibly
in
consequence
if
one
could
only
discover
why
clever
men
marry
that
sort
of
women
i
wondered
oh
jerry
thought
he
was
going
to
bend
her
to
his
will
sarah
explained
but
that
kind
do
bend
they
just
slump
i
had
hardly
knocked
at
the
door
before
i
had
an
inkling
of
how
painful
to
the
author
of
the
futurist
the
process
of
slumping
might
be
i
could
hear
the
fretting
of
a
child
hushed
suddenly
by
my
knock
then
the
patter
of
little
feet
across
the
floor
and
voices
startled
and
pitched
low
i
was
just
debating
whether
i
should
pretend
i
heard
anything
and
go
away
again
when
mcdermott
opened
the
door
i
had
met
him
once
at
sarah
and
should
have
known
him
again
by
the
pallor
of
his
countenance
against
the
dead
blackness
of
his
hair
straight
and
shining
like
an
indian
the
effect
of
boyishness
that
one
derived
from
his
tall
thin
figure
was
increased
now
by
the
marks
of
weeping
about
his
eyes
in
the
glimpse
of
the
room
behind
him
i
was
aware
of
a
disorder
only
excusable
in
the
face
of
a
family
catastrophe
one
of
the
children
that
ran
to
his
knee
was
still
in
its
little
petticoat
without
a
slip
and
had
not
been
washed
or
combed
that
day
i
wavered
an
instant
between
the
obligation
of
politeness
to
ignore
the
situation
and
the
certainty
that
i
could
oh
i
cried
i
snatched
at
my
repertory
for
the
proper
mixture
of
commiseration
and
consternation
is
any
one
ill
his
desperate
need
of
help
opened
the
door
to
me
my
wife
he
began
but
the
state
of
the
room
accounted
for
that
as
he
perceived
taking
it
in
afresh
through
my
eyes
mcdermott
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
coma
of
exhaustion
she
lifted
her
face
to
me
for
a
moment
swollen
with
crying
and
then
let
herself
go
again
into
that
pit
in
which
a
woman
sinks
an
impossible
situation
she
was
really
faint
poor
thing
and
if
i
judged
by
the
state
of
the
house
had
had
no
luncheon
i
took
all
that
in
at
a
glance
but
it
was
none
of
my
business
is
it
her
heart
i
wanted
to
know
of
her
husband
as
i
bent
over
her
he
caught
up
the
suggestion
eagerly
yes
her
heart
she
is
very
weak
he
did
whatever
i
suggested
on
that
explanation
i
would
have
proposed
putting
her
to
bed
if
i
had
not
feared
that
that
would
involve
more
revelations
of
the
family
disorder
than
i
was
willing
to
tax
him
with
we
got
her
out
of
her
faintness
presently
and
found
her
a
safety
valve
in
pitying
her
poor
children
with
that
sloppy
sort
of
maternal
affection
which
is
not
inconsistent
with
a
good
deal
of
neglect
i
was
working
for
anything
but
to
save
jerry
i
came
to
call
him
that
before
many
weeks
from
the
embarrassment
of
what
i
was
sure
had
been
a
family
fracas
which
threatened
at
every
moment
to
break
out
again
i
suggested
tea
for
i
was
satisfied
that
both
of
them
wanted
food
and
while
i
was
making
toast
before
the
fire
mcdermott
managed
to
get
herself
and
the
children
into
some
sort
of
order
i
could
see
then
how
pretty
she
had
been
in
a
way
and
how
charming
in
her
youth
had
been
the
inconsequence
which
as
the
mistress
of
a
family
made
her
a
sloven
not
to
seem
to
notice
too
much
the
superficial
air
of
being
prepared
for
company
which
she
managed
to
give
the
children
by
washing
their
faces
surreptitiously
i
explained
to
mcdermott
that
i
had
come
about
the
part
of
oh
you
do
he
assented
heartily
you
do
just
as
you
are
is
a
widow
you
know
that
is
the
that
i
created
just
as
you
conceived
it
of
course
i
insisted
i
should
want
to
play
it
that
way
the
trouble
is
that
moresco
is
satisfied
so
easily
he
wants
me
to
make
changes
in
the
part
well
i
was
prepared
to
make
concessions
i
afraid
he
has
somebody
in
mind
fancy
filette
his
wife
broke
in
a
painting
flirting
immoral
jerry
scraped
his
chair
back
along
the
floor
to
cover
the
word
but
i
knew
where
i
was
in
a
twinkling
fancy
filette
she
play
it
in
short
skirts
i
be
lucky
if
she
does
insist
on
a
song
and
dance
he
does
need
to
have
her
unless
he
wants
to
mcdermott
was
positive
on
that
point
she
was
sitting
with
both
children
on
her
lap
chiefly
in
order
to
keep
up
the
fiction
that
i
did
know
she
had
just
been
having
hysterics
i
had
cautioned
her
against
letting
them
climb
over
her
and
she
promptly
let
them
because
the
idea
that
she
was
tending
them
at
a
risk
to
her
health
rather
helped
out
with
her
own
notion
of
herself
as
a
misused
but
devoted
wife
and
mother
jerry
looked
at
me
over
her
head
in
a
mute
appeal
to
me
to
understand
unless
moresco
puts
on
my
play
there
is
no
chance
for
it
he
protested
i
been
to
the
others
i
tell
you
though
if
you
go
to
him
just
as
you
are
he
may
think
better
of
it
he
ca
possibly
get
anybody
so
good
we
neither
of
us
believed
that
moresco
would
turn
down
fancy
filette
for
anybody
but
we
kept
up
the
game
of
thinking
so
from
sheer
desperation
i
played
too
at
the
pretence
that
jerry
wife
was
a
delicate
idealized
sort
of
creature
who
did
not
understand
the
great
hard
world
that
was
no
doubt
what
had
appealed
to
him
in
the
beginning
but
she
was
made
up
for
the
part
she
had
begun
to
put
on
weight
after
she
had
children
and
her
hair
wanted
washing
i
got
away
as
soon
as
i
could
and
went
straight
to
sarah
they
been
having
some
kind
of
a
row
i
told
her
oh
it
must
have
been
fancy
filette
who
set
her
off
sarah
was
certain
she
took
to
you
as
a
relief
but
you
be
in
for
it
too
if
you
get
the
part
i
had
to
admit
to
myself
after
i
had
been
to
moresco
that
there
was
not
much
likelihood
that
i
would
get
it
he
laid
the
tips
of
his
pudgy
fingers
together
and
addressed
me
with
the
slight
blur
in
his
speech
which
convinced
one
of
the
racial
affinity
which
he
commonly
denied
mcdermott
thinks
it
will
suit
me
admirably
i
told
him
ah
yes
the
author
the
manager
mentioned
him
as
though
it
were
a
fact
indulgently
admitted
to
the
discussion
but
then
my
dear
miss
lattimore
we
have
to
think
of
the
audience
there
was
this
peculiarity
of
moresco
handling
of
an
audience
that
he
treated
it
as
an
entity
a
sort
of
human
stratification
of
which
the
three
front
rows
were
lubricious
the
body
of
the
orchestra
the
first
balcony
sentimental
and
virtuous
the
gallery
facetious
as
far
as
possible
he
arranged
his
plays
to
meet
the
requirements
now
we
have
miss
croyden
for
she
is
your
type
he
meant
as
a
woman
not
as
an
artist
sarah
and
i
were
both
serious
and
for
i
think
we
should
have
something
a
little
more
snappy
it
is
written
snappy
in
the
play
i
reminded
him
ah
no
that
is
the
trouble
i
have
spoken
to
mcdermott
he
will
perhaps
change
it
and
if
he
does
you
will
keep
me
in
mind
for
it
i
kept
my
voice
with
difficulty
from
being
urgent
you
see
i
do
feel
like
playing
a
heavy
part
this
year
i
glanced
down
at
my
mourning
i
hoped
he
would
accept
it
as
an
explanation
two
or
three
days
later
i
saw
sarah
and
she
remarked
that
jerry
was
rewriting
some
parts
of
his
play
at
the
request
of
the
manager
the
part
of
sarah
nodded
moresco
wants
it
more
more
snappy
i
supplied
and
who
is
to
have
it
have
you
heard
fancy
filette
oh
well
she
snappy
enough
i
suppose
i
know
i
do
even
like
to
be
billed
with
her
but
anyway
the
part
was
worthy
of
you
but
i
felt
as
i
went
home
to
my
lodging
that
that
was
only
sarah
kind
way
of
putting
it
chapter
ii
i
saw
more
than
a
little
of
jerry
mcdermott
during
the
spring
and
summer
that
i
stayed
in
chicago
haunting
managers
offices
in
my
winter
suit
and
a
fixed
determination
not
to
let
any
of
them
suspect
that
i
knew
i
could
for
the
moment
act
at
all
where
the
gift
had
gone
i
did
not
know
nor
when
in
some
desperate
encounter
with
the
chance
of
an
engagement
i
attempted
to
draw
about
me
the
tattered
remnants
of
my
old
facility
had
i
any
notion
what
would
bring
it
back
again
effie
wrote
me
to
come
home
for
the
hot
weather
but
though
i
regretted
afterward
not
having
done
so
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
leave
chicago
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
the
deadly
quality
of
taylorville
lay
waiting
like
a
trap
which
in
my
present
benumbed
condition
might
close
on
me
if
i
put
myself
in
the
way
of
it
i
thought
that
if
i
got
out
of
reach
of
the
flare
of
light
from
the
theatre
doors
of
the
smell
of
back
scenes
and
the
florid
grip
of
the
posters
that
i
should
never
in
this
world
win
back
to
them
a
summer
in
taylorville
would
have
saved
me
money
would
have
rested
and
perhaps
restored
the
balance
of
my
powers
but
the
inward
monitor
of
which
i
was
the
mere
shell
and
surface
clutched
upon
the
city
with
the
grip
of
desperation
i
hung
upon
whatever
slight
attachments
to
the
theatre
my
circumstances
afforded
like
the
drowned
upon
a
rope
and
waited
for
the
resuscitating
touch
somewhere
beyond
me
i
was
aware
of
succour
not
knowing
from
whence
it
should
come
i
grasped
at
everything
within
reach
and
was
buffeted
and
torn
about
in
the
eddy
of
reverses
what
more
even
than
his
need
of
me
drove
me
back
on
gerald
mcdermott
was
the
certainty
that
he
was
deriving
from
fancy
filette
the
quality
i
missed
she
was
playing
in
one
of
the
cheaper
theatres
in
one
of
those
entertainments
that
men
are
supposed
to
resort
to
when
their
families
are
out
of
town
and
i
had
a
moment
feeling
that
he
exposed
his
sex
to
ridicule
by
the
avidity
with
which
he
surrendered
himself
to
her
perfectly
obvious
methods
until
he
sent
his
family
north
to
one
of
the
lake
resorts
for
the
hot
weather
i
found
myself
involved
in
certain
obligations
of
visiting
at
his
house
where
i
saw
that
his
wife
created
for
him
by
her
incompetence
much
the
same
sort
of
background
that
my
bereaved
and
condition
made
for
me
and
watched
with
alternate
sympathy
and
resentment
his
flight
from
it
to
the
effective
which
miss
filette
induced
in
him
i
do
mean
that
jerry
was
fond
of
his
wife
in
a
way
and
faithful
to
her
in
so
far
as
she
did
interfere
with
his
male
prerogative
of
being
played
upon
by
other
women
but
i
do
not
think
he
had
ever
an
inkling
that
the
vortex
of
anger
and
despair
which
she
forced
him
to
share
with
her
in
lieu
of
the
passion
which
she
could
any
more
excite
was
of
the
same
stripe
as
his
need
of
the
high
inflated
mood
that
miss
filette
provided
for
him
with
her
little
bag
of
tricks
for
from
the
first
jerry
seized
on
me
poured
himself
out
despoiled
himself
of
all
the
hopes
conjectures
of
his
career
and
that
without
in
the
least
discovering
that
i
was
in
need
of
much
the
same
sort
of
relief
myself
after
his
wife
had
taken
the
children
to
the
country
though
she
used
even
then
to
come
down
on
him
suddenly
with
both
of
them
and
break
up
his
work
for
days
or
just
when
it
was
running
smoothly
wire
to
him
to
rush
up
to
lake
view
and
allay
the
horrors
of
her
too
active
imagination
often
evenings
after
the
day
work
he
would
take
me
to
dine
at
queer
little
french
or
italian
restaurants
which
were
supposed
to
be
preferred
on
account
of
the
atmosphere
rather
than
their
cheapness
and
uncoil
for
me
there
all
the
intricate
turnings
of
his
work
upon
itself
and
the
rich
shapes
and
colours
it
took
played
upon
by
the
slanting
eyes
and
carmine
smile
of
miss
filette
he
would
sit
opposite
me
with
a
cigarette
and
a
glass
of
dago
red
his
black
shining
hair
which
he
wore
too
long
slanting
above
his
forehead
like
a
boding
wing
uncramping
his
soul
and
though
i
liked
him
as
a
friend
and
as
a
playwright
thought
him
immensely
worth
while
i
was
divided
between
exasperation
at
his
tacit
exclusion
of
me
from
the
world
of
excited
powers
in
which
any
stimulation
of
his
maleness
threw
him
and
fear
that
in
missing
his
capacity
for
quick
shallow
passions
i
had
missed
the
one
indispensable
thing
for
my
art
it
is
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
jerry
would
be
reassuring
me
to
delineate
a
character
that
will
be
so
intimate
an
expression
of
the
one
who
is
to
play
it
it
really
extraordinary
that
she
should
have
been
named
fancy
it
symbolic
oh
if
you
imagine
she
is
really
in
the
least
like
the
you
are
creating
besides
i
happen
to
know
her
name
is
powers
amanda
powers
he
caught
at
this
delightedly
ah
she
a
poet
a
poet
such
to
think
of
her
knowing
what
would
suit
her
so
exactly
but
i
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
miss
filette
psychology
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
was
the
source
of
the
creative
mood
which
i
was
sensible
did
not
arise
from
anything
miss
filette
was
but
from
what
jerry
was
able
to
think
of
her
i
admitted
it
was
a
mood
you
had
to
be
helped
to
but
i
was
going
to
accept
it
from
any
male
compliment
to
his
inamorata
i
set
up
jerry
case
alongside
of
miss
dean
and
manager
and
a
kind
of
fine
intolerance
drove
me
from
it
as
ships
are
driven
apart
upon
the
tide
it
drove
me
back
in
the
first
instance
upon
what
pauline
and
henry
mills
stood
for
in
my
life
i
was
full
of
a
formless
importunate
capacity
like
the
motor
impulses
of
a
paralytic
and
i
imagined
a
relief
from
it
in
the
shadow
of
some
succoring
male
who
by
assuming
the
traditional
responsibility
of
getting
a
living
should
leave
me
free
to
produce
the
perfect
flower
of
art
at
the
time
i
was
as
far
from
realizing
as
pauline
that
she
was
eminently
the
sort
of
woman
the
sheltered
life
produced
had
henry
mills
been
upon
the
market
i
should
have
seized
upon
him
promptly
as
the
solution
of
all
my
difficulties
pauline
did
her
best
for
me
that
is
to
say
she
brought
out
for
me
an
infinite
variety
and
arrangement
of
the
sentimentalized
sex
attractions
with
which
she
charmed
dull
care
from
henry
brow
it
was
only
by
degrees
that
i
perceived
that
the
utter
want
of
relativity
of
the
quality
that
was
known
in
evanston
as
true
womanliness
was
due
to
its
being
conditioned
very
much
as
i
thought
of
myself
as
happiest
to
be
it
was
not
until
pauline
went
to
the
country
for
the
hot
weather
without
making
any
sensible
change
in
my
affairs
that
i
began
to
understand
how
little
she
contributed
what
i
chiefly
missed
was
a
place
to
walk
to
when
i
went
out
for
exercise
i
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
just
walking
for
there
was
not
much
doing
in
the
theatrical
line
to
interest
me
and
i
was
sustained
and
tormented
by
intimations
that
somewhere
not
far
from
me
my
help
walked
too
i
do
know
where
this
conviction
came
from
that
there
was
help
somewhere
in
the
world
but
by
the
middle
of
the
summer
the
terrible
keen
need
of
it
walked
with
me
through
all
my
days
and
lay
down
with
me
at
night
there
were
times
when
the
certainty
that
it
was
there
seemed
almost
enough
to
lift
me
again
to
a
plane
of
power
other
times
when
the
sheer
hunger
of
it
bit
into
the
bone
it
was
most
like
the
sense
i
had
had
as
a
child
of
the
large
friendliness
that
brooded
over
pasture
it
was
like
the
promise
of
the
shining
destiny
that
had
moved
between
my
youth
and
the
common
occurrence
but
now
at
times
just
along
the
edge
of
sleep
or
out
of
the
thick
waking
drowse
of
heat
it
shaped
familiarly
human
i
think
about
that
time
i
must
have
dreamed
again
the
dream
i
had
of
helmeth
garrett
just
after
i
had
seen
modjeska
writing
that
letter
in
his
uncle
house
and
with
the
help
of
what
my
mother
had
told
me
i
was
able
to
read
it
plain
i
do
not
distinctly
remember
dreaming
this
but
there
were
times
when
just
after
waking
my
mind
would
be
full
of
him
and
there
would
be
a
stir
in
me
of
the
wings
of
power
but
in
the
broad
day
though
i
thought
of
him
often
i
could
not
so
much
as
recall
his
face
clearly
the
one
thing
that
i
remembered
about
him
was
that
i
had
pleased
him
it
was
a
mortifying
certainty
that
jerry
ready
acceptance
of
me
as
a
woman
of
whom
his
wife
could
not
possibly
be
jealous
had
defined
for
me
that
i
did
in
general
know
how
to
please
and
interest
men
they
often
were
interested
in
me
but
i
was
never
in
the
least
conscious
of
what
drew
them
or
caused
them
to
sheer
away
i
had
a
suspicion
doubtless
of
taylorvillian
extraction
that
there
was
a
sort
of
culpability
in
knowing
but
it
came
back
to
me
now
almost
with
a
thrill
that
i
had
known
with
helmeth
garrett
i
had
been
able
out
of
all
the
possible
things
which
might
be
said
to
choose
the
thing
that
swayed
him
i
had
known
ever
for
what
things
my
husband
loved
me
but
in
a
brief
hour
with
helmeth
garrett
i
was
conscious
of
much
in
my
manner
to
him
arising
from
his
conscious
need
and
i
had
no
more
than
shaped
this
in
my
mind
than
i
felt
a
faint
stirring
within
me
as
of
power
about
this
time
i
began
to
be
more
aware
of
the
something
without
toward
which
my
work
tended
just
after
i
had
been
asleep
as
if
the
self
of
me
had
gone
on
seeking
more
successfully
in
the
silences
i
would
arise
very
early
with
such
a
faint
consciousness
as
a
vine
might
have
toward
the
nearest
wall
and
get
up
in
the
blue
of
the
morning
to
go
for
long
walks
through
the
pleasant
empty
streets
sometimes
out
to
the
lake
shore
where
the
glint
of
the
moving
water
under
the
mist
struck
faint
sparkles
from
my
stagnant
surfaces
i
would
come
back
from
these
excursions
beginning
to
faint
with
the
day
heat
to
wear
through
the
afternoon
with
books
and
long
drowses
and
then
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
it
would
call
me
again
and
i
would
seek
it
until
late
at
night
sometimes
in
the
lit
streets
fetid
with
the
day
smells
sometimes
on
a
roof
garden
or
at
a
park
concert
where
the
lights
the
gayety
and
the
music
served
merely
as
a
drug
to
my
outer
sense
which
went
on
busily
at
its
absorbing
quest
sometimes
men
spoke
to
me
in
these
lonely
wanderings
i
would
remember
it
afterward
as
one
recalls
little
unnoticed
incidents
in
the
midst
of
great
excitement
but
for
the
most
part
i
was
except
for
the
invisible
presence
as
unaccompanied
as
if
the
city
had
been
quite
empty
if
i
could
have
laid
the
anxiety
of
my
diminishing
bank
account
and
the
dread
of
not
getting
an
engagement
i
should
have
been
almost
happy
it
was
along
early
in
august
that
chicago
was
greatly
stirred
by
the
visit
of
one
of
the
presidential
candidates
for
that
was
a
presidential
year
who
was
also
a
popular
hero
it
had
come
rather
unexpectedly
and
the
preparations
for
it
were
of
the
hastiest
there
was
to
be
speaking
at
armory
hall
and
a
reception
afterward
and
i
thought
i
would
go
and
clasp
hands
with
the
great
man
as
if
perhaps
i
might
find
in
it
as
many
of
his
admirers
did
a
sort
of
king
touch
for
the
lethargy
of
my
spirit
the
meeting
began
early
in
the
sweating
afternoon
and
dragged
out
three
heavy
hours
nothing
of
any
importance
transpired
there
until
we
were
moving
up
the
right
side
of
the
hall
toward
the
receiving
committee
the
hall
was
split
lengthwise
by
a
bank
of
chairs
and
down
the
left
aisle
the
company
of
those
who
had
already
gripped
the
broad
palm
of
the
candidate
had
been
elbowed
to
oblivion
by
the
committee
it
was
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
handshaking
and
there
were
not
so
many
of
them
as
of
us
they
lingered
in
groups
and
talked
with
one
another
i
was
about
midway
of
the
aisles
and
several
persons
deep
in
the
crush
when
i
saw
him
how
well
i
knew
the
lock
falling
over
his
forehead
and
the
quick
unconscious
motion
of
the
head
that
tossed
it
back
there
was
the
indefinable
air
of
the
outdoor
man
about
him
though
he
was
quite
correctly
dressed
and
had
a
lady
light
wrap
over
his
arm
helmeth
helmeth
i
cried
out
to
him
from
the
centre
of
my
will
i
fought
my
way
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
moving
crowd
i
caught
at
chairs
and
struggled
to
maintain
my
position
opposite
him
he
was
talking
to
two
or
three
men
and
just
at
the
edge
of
the
group
a
woman
stood
with
an
air
of
waiting
i
resented
her
immobility
so
near
him
and
so
little
moved
by
him
helmeth
helmeth
look
look
at
me
i
demanded
voicelessly
across
the
bank
of
chairs
he
heard
me
slowly
he
turned
his
attention
wandered
from
the
group
helmeth
helmeth
all
my
will
was
in
my
cry
now
he
looked
in
my
direction
there
was
that
in
his
face
that
told
me
my
cry
had
touched
the
outer
ring
of
his
consciousness
then
the
lady
who
stood
by
took
advantage
of
his
detachment
to
touch
him
on
the
arm
only
a
man
wife
touches
him
like
that
i
knew
her
at
once
she
was
the
type
of
woman
who
subscribes
to
the
and
belongs
to
the
church
because
she
thinks
it
is
an
excellent
thing
for
other
people
she
had
blond
hair
discreetly
frizzled
about
the
temples
and
her
dress
had
been
made
at
home
as
soon
as
she
touched
him
helmeth
garrett
turned
to
her
with
divided
attention
i
saw
her
take
his
arm
he
looked
back
the
cry
held
him
his
eyes
roved
up
and
down
the
moving
mass
closed
between
us
and
carried
me
completely
out
of
sight
it
was
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
crowd
released
me
and
by
that
time
he
had
quite
vanished
i
hung
about
the
entrance
to
the
hall
i
pushed
here
and
there
in
the
press
elbowed
out
of
it
by
resentful
citizens
at
last
when
the
hall
was
closed
and
even
the
policemen
had
gone
from
before
it
i
went
home
to
lie
awake
half
the
night
planning
how
to
get
at
him
and
the
moment
i
woke
from
the
doze
of
exhaustion
into
which
i
finally
fell
i
knew
that
the
thread
which
bound
me
to
chicago
had
snapped
i
stayed
on
two
or
three
days
vaguely
hoping
to
come
across
him
i
even
looked
in
the
hotel
registers
before
i
accepted
sarah
urgent
invitation
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
month
with
her
at
lake
view
one
night
when
the
wind
out
of
the
lake
was
fresh
enough
to
suggest
in
the
closed
window
and
the
drawn
blind
a
reciprocated
intimacy
i
told
sarah
all
about
helmeth
garrett
and
to
think
i
said
how
different
it
all
might
have
been
if
only
i
had
got
that
letter
yes
sarah
admitted
but
that
does
prove
you
have
been
happy
not
if
we
loved
one
another
oh
i
am
not
sure
loving
has
anything
to
do
with
happiness
or
is
meant
to
sometimes
i
think
god
or
whoever
it
is
manages
things
has
a
very
poor
opinion
of
happiness
because
you
do
find
it
invariably
along
with
the
best
of
experiences
it
happens
or
it
does
if
love
does
anything
for
you
it
is
just
to
give
you
the
use
of
yourself
but
it
has
i
protested
i
just
stumping
along
you
have
really
had
it
just
being
kissed
once
what
does
that
amount
to
oh
sarah
sarah
that
is
what
hurts
me
i
have
really
had
it
never
going
to
i
just
go
halting
like
this
all
my
life
no
you
wo
sarah
shook
her
head
piecing
her
own
knowledge
slowly
into
comfort
for
me
you
remember
what
i
told
you
that
time
when
you
found
out
about
dean
and
there
a
kind
of
feeling
that
goes
with
acting
that
is
like
loving
only
it
is
i
do
know
where
it
comes
from
maybe
it
is
what
they
call
genius
but
i
know
you
can
slide
off
from
loving
into
it
that
is
what
makes
jerry
think
he
has
to
be
in
love
all
the
time
it
is
a
little
stair
he
climbs
up
and
then
he
goes
sailing
off
you
do
think
fancy
filette
really
does
anything
for
him
goodness
no
she
has
a
teaspoonful
of
brains
well
then
she
triumphed
after
a
while
his
genius
will
be
so
strong
in
him
that
he
wo
need
that
sort
of
thing
and
he
will
think
it
ridiculous
and
you
think
that
will
come
to
me
it
did
come
you
did
have
to
be
in
love
to
begin
sarah
objected
sarah
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
in
love
all
the
time
i
know
with
whom
but
always
wanting
somebody
trying
to
get
through
to
something
trying
to
mate
that
was
it
nights
when
i
would
do
my
best
and
the
house
would
be
storming
and
cheering
i
would
look
around
for
for
somebody
and
i
would
go
to
my
room
and
he
would
be
there
i
used
to
think
tommy
would
be
he
i
wanted
him
to
be
i
thought
some
day
i
would
turn
around
suddenly
and
find
him
changed
into
whatever
it
was
i
wanted
but
i
know
now
he
never
could
have
been
that
and
all
this
summer
i
heard
it
calling
i
walked
and
walked
sometimes
it
was
just
around
the
corner
but
i
never
caught
up
with
it
and
when
i
saw
helmeth
garrett
i
i
had
leaned
back
out
of
the
circle
of
our
small
shaded
lamp
to
make
my
confession
but
sarah
came
forward
into
it
the
better
to
show
me
the
condoning
tenderness
of
her
smile
it
no
use
sarah
i
no
genius
i
have
to
be
in
love
like
the
rest
of
them
she
shook
her
head
gently
you
get
across
love
would
help
i
wish
you
had
it
but
i
confess
to
you
i
had
love
and
it
only
opened
the
door
there
something
beyond
bigger
than
all
men
you
must
reach
out
and
lay
hold
of
it
oh
if
it
were
love
one
needed
i
should
die
i
should
die
i
had
never
seen
her
so
moved
before
tell
me
sarah
i
always
wanted
to
know
i
want
you
to
know
but
it
is
easy
i
did
know
anything
about
love
how
could
i
the
way
i
was
brought
up
my
father
was
a
baptist
preacher
i
had
been
taught
that
it
was
wrong
to
let
anybody
touch
you
and
when
he
kissed
me
i
felt
as
if
he
had
the
right
i
know
i
know
i
had
been
kissed
that
way
myself
how
can
anybody
know
i
loved
him
and
i
was
the
only
one
of
many
he
left
me
without
a
word
like
a
woman
of
the
street
not
looking
backward
she
got
up
and
moved
about
the
room
the
thick
coil
of
her
rich
brown
hair
slipping
to
her
shoulders
and
her
bodily
perfection
under
the
thin
dressing
gown
distracting
me
even
from
the
passion
of
her
speech
i
had
a
momentary
pang
of
sympathy
with
the
delinquent
lawrence
i
could
see
how
a
man
might
be
afraid
almost
of
the
quality
of
her
beauty
sometimes
she
said
i
think
marriage
is
a
much
more
real
relation
than
people
think
that
something
real
but
invisible
happens
between
them
so
that
even
if
they
are
parted
they
are
never
quite
the
same
again
it
is
like
having
a
limb
torn
from
you
you
ache
always
in
the
part
you
have
lost
i
knew
something
of
what
that
ache
could
be
but
i
could
only
turn
my
face
up
to
hers
that
she
might
see
my
tears
you
have
enough
of
your
own
to
bear
she
said
i
must
not
lay
my
troubles
on
you
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
i
know
it
is
not
love
that
makes
art
i
was
dying
for
love
when
put
me
to
acting
i
was
bleeding
so
and
suddenly
i
reached
out
and
laid
hold
of
whatever
is
and
i
found
i
could
act
it
was
as
if
the
half
of
me
that
had
been
torn
away
had
been
between
me
and
it
and
i
laid
hold
of
it
that
how
i
know
she
came
behind
me
leaning
on
my
chair
and
i
put
up
my
hands
to
her
oh
sarah
sarah
help
me
to
lay
hold
of
it
too
but
for
all
her
shy
confidences
deep
within
i
did
believe
her
toward
the
first
of
september
we
went
back
to
the
city
sarah
to
begin
rehearsals
for
and
i
to
take
up
the
dreary
round
of
manager
offices
and
dramatic
agencies
the
best
that
was
offered
me
was
poor
enough
but
it
had
a
faint
savour
of
a
superior
motive
clinging
to
it
it
was
from
a
coleman
an
actor
manager
of
the
old
shakespearian
type
who
was
projecting
a
classic
revival
with
himself
in
all
the
tragic
parts
and
i
signed
with
him
to
play
and
the
wife
of
we
had
been
busy
with
rehearsals
about
ten
days
when
i
had
a
telegram
from
forester
saying
that
mother
had
died
that
day
and
i
was
to
come
immediately
it
was
late
sunday
evening
when
i
received
it
and
i
hunted
up
the
manager
at
the
hotel
i
going
i
told
him
well
of
course
your
contract
i
going
anyway
and
i
know
the
lines
he
was
as
considerate
i
suppose
as
could
be
expected
i
can
give
you
three
days
he
calculated
four
i
stipulated
well
four
he
grudged
that
would
allow
two
days
for
the
funeral
chapter
iii
as
it
turned
out
i
was
more
than
a
month
in
taylorville
and
so
saved
myself
from
the
coleman
players
for
a
more
kindly
destiny
though
at
the
time
it
did
not
appear
so
it
grew
out
of
my
realizing
in
effie
first
clasp
of
me
something
more
than
our
common
loss
more
than
family
something
that
i
felt
myself
answer
to
before
we
could
have
any
talk
together
that
did
not
relate
to
the
funeral
and
the
manner
of
my
mother
death
they
thought
from
little
things
that
came
to
mind
afterward
that
she
must
have
been
prepared
for
it
but
forebore
to
trouble
them
with
a
presentiment
of
what
could
not
in
any
case
have
been
much
longer
delayed
she
had
clung
to
them
more
and
been
still
more
loath
to
trouble
them
with
her
wants
the
saturday
before
she
had
made
effie
understand
that
she
wished
all
the
photographs
of
my
father
brought
together
queer
little
old
daguerrotypes
of
him
as
a
young
man
a
tintype
of
him
in
his
volunteer
soldier
dress
and
a
large
faded
photo
of
him
as
an
officer
leaning
on
his
sword
she
kept
them
by
her
and
would
be
seen
poring
upon
them
as
though
she
tried
to
fix
the
identity
of
one
about
to
be
met
under
unfamiliar
or
confusing
circumstances
though
they
did
not
think
of
this
until
afterward
the
sunday
of
her
death
cousin
judd
had
come
in
to
sit
with
her
as
his
custom
was
an
hour
earlier
than
the
morning
service
he
had
read
the
day
lesson
from
the
bible
and
sung
the
hymn
and
then
after
an
interval
effie
who
was
busy
about
the
back
of
the
house
heard
him
sing
again
my
mother
favourite
hymn
come
thou
fount
of
every
blessing
tune
my
heart
to
sing
thy
praise
and
as
he
sung
she
saw
the
tears
rolling
down
his
face
so
she
turned
her
back
on
them
and
let
them
say
their
without
her
though
she
had
no
notion
how
near
the
final
parting
was
forester
was
dressing
he
and
effie
had
taken
turns
at
ever
since
mother
stroke
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
cousin
judd
had
gone
off
without
him
mother
clung
to
him
when
he
went
to
kiss
her
she
struggled
with
her
impotence
but
they
made
out
that
it
was
not
because
she
wanted
him
to
stay
at
home
with
her
and
for
the
first
time
since
her
illness
she
wished
not
to
be
propped
up
at
the
window
where
she
could
sign
to
the
neighbours
going
by
but
seemed
to
want
greatly
to
sleep
effie
wheeled
her
into
the
corner
of
the
sitting
room
and
a
little
later
she
noticed
that
mother
head
had
slipped
down
on
the
pillow
as
it
did
sometimes
past
her
power
to
lift
it
up
again
so
my
sister
straightened
the
poor
head
with
a
kiss
and
went
back
to
getting
the
dinner
she
moved
softly
because
mother
seemed
asleep
but
at
last
when
she
went
as
usual
to
tell
her
that
forester
was
visible
at
the
end
of
the
street
on
the
way
home
she
saw
that
the
head
had
slipped
down
again
and
this
time
as
she
lifted
it
up
there
was
no
life
in
it
at
all
one
of
the
strange
incidents
of
that
morning
and
yet
not
strange
when
you
think
how
much
they
had
been
to
one
another
was
that
cousin
judd
though
he
had
started
home
directly
after
church
could
not
get
there
but
when
he
had
driven
a
little
way
out
of
town
drawn
by
he
knew
not
what
unseen
force
turned
back
and
pulled
up
in
front
of
our
door
just
as
the
doctor
who
had
been
summoned
hastily
was
saying
that
mother
had
been
dead
an
hour
it
was
monday
morning
when
i
arrived
and
the
funeral
could
not
be
until
tuesday
to
allow
time
for
the
news
to
penetrate
to
all
the
distant
country
places
from
which
my
mother
relatives
would
be
drawn
to
it
moved
and
anxious
to
come
though
many
of
them
had
not
seen
her
for
a
matter
of
years
i
think
i
realized
at
once
how
it
would
be
about
my
getting
back
to
chicago
especially
when
i
spoke
to
effie
about
it
she
cried
out
and
clung
to
me
in
a
way
that
made
me
see
that
i
stood
for
something
more
to
her
than
just
sisterliness
without
saying
anything
i
wrote
to
coleman
that
i
should
be
detained
a
week
or
longer
and
that
though
i
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
save
my
place
for
me
i
really
expect
that
he
would
it
was
not
in
the
taylorville
cemetery
that
we
buried
my
mother
but
in
a
little
plot
set
aside
from
the
old
judd
place
along
with
the
rest
of
the
wilsons
judds
and
jewetts
those
that
had
dropped
back
peacefully
to
their
native
sod
and
those
sent
home
from
gettysburg
and
appomattox
it
was
a
longish
ride
from
turn
to
turn
of
the
country
road
teams
dropped
into
the
procession
that
led
out
from
town
on
either
side
the
woods
blazed
like
the
ranked
cherubim
host
on
host
great
shoals
of
fiery
leaves
lay
in
the
shallows
of
the
burying
ground
at
the
last
shaken
by
the
light
breeze
that
sprung
up
little
flamy
darts
from
the
oak
whirled
into
the
grave
with
her
they
were
to
say
in
their
own
fashion
that
there
was
nothing
more
natural
i
think
my
mother
must
have
found
it
so
we
had
scarcely
got
home
again
still
sitting
about
veiled
and
voluminous
when
i
was
drawn
out
of
grief
to
meet
effie
emergency
it
was
almira
jewett
who
brought
me
face
to
face
with
it
almira
had
taken
off
her
things
and
was
getting
tea
for
us
in
her
brisk
capable
way
anyhow
she
said
i
you
stay
with
your
sister
until
she
gets
sort
of
used
to
things
it
flashed
on
me
that
what
she
was
expected
to
get
used
to
was
going
on
just
as
she
had
been
without
the
excuse
of
my
mother
needing
her
oh
i
stay
till
the
breaking
up
i
met
her
promptly
my
land
said
almira
jewett
you
talking
of
the
breakin
up
and
your
mother
ai
hardly
out
of
the
house
yet
they
do
say
there
nothing
like
to
make
you
nimble
in
your
feelings
i
knew
of
course
that
they
would
lay
it
to
the
defibricating
influence
of
my
profession
that
i
should
take
the
breaking
up
of
my
mother
home
so
lightly
but
i
had
caught
a
brief
hiatus
in
effie
sobs
and
i
realized
that
what
the
poor
child
was
afraid
of
was
being
hypnotized
into
a
situation
against
which
her
natural
good
sense
revolted
i
was
bracing
myself
against
the
tradition
of
filial
obligation
that
i
felt
was
going
to
be
put
in
force
against
me
when
suddenly
help
arrived
from
an
unsuspected
quarter
i
you
going
with
a
troupe
yet
cousin
lydia
interposed
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
i
believe
delivering
herself
of
a
conclusion
it
a
pity
because
if
you
was
anyways
settled
you
could
take
effie
with
you
forester
was
a
good
son
she
ruminated
on
that
for
a
while
he
was
what
you
call
a
real
model
son
but
i
do
know
as
i
want
to
see
effie
married
to
him
the
same
as
your
mother
was
it
gave
me
a
shock
to
think
that
all
these
years
she
must
have
been
seeing
how
things
were
she
sha
i
assured
her
not
if
i
have
to
stay
with
forrie
myself
i
had
thought
a
good
many
times
what
was
to
become
of
effie
i
take
her
with
me
of
course
but
i
was
in
the
least
prepared
to
see
her
intrigued
by
the
popular
sentiment
into
becoming
a
mere
figurehead
for
forester
of
provider
keeping
up
a
home
they
called
it
in
taylorville
as
though
the
house
and
furniture
and
the
daily
habit
of
coming
back
to
it
were
the
pivotal
facts
of
existence
it
almost
seemed
as
if
it
might
come
to
that
after
the
others
were
all
gone
and
the
night
closed
in
on
us
three
the
spirit
of
the
dead
came
and
stood
among
us
effie
wept
in
forrie
arms
and
said
that
he
should
not
be
quite
bereft
he
should
have
her
anyway
you
poor
child
you
got
a
brother
left
you
too
olivia
you
sha
want
for
a
home
while
i
live
that
of
course
was
the
sort
of
thing
taylorville
expected
of
him
it
began
to
seem
as
if
i
might
have
to
make
good
my
word
about
staying
with
my
brother
to
let
effie
free
i
believe
he
would
have
accepted
that
without
even
a
suspicion
of
what
i
surrendered
by
it
if
anything
he
would
have
seen
in
it
only
another
dramatization
of
his
of
dutifulness
that
a
woman
had
any
preferred
employment
beside
cushioning
life
for
the
males
of
her
family
had
not
impinged
on
the
consciousness
of
taylorville
but
the
very
next
morning
i
awoke
anew
to
the
purpose
of
rescuing
effie
and
to
the
recollection
of
an
incident
of
the
funeral
noted
but
not
taken
into
the
reckoning
in
the
stress
of
more
absorbing
emotions
effie
was
that
jastrow
i
saw
at
the
cemetery
yesterday
with
her
head
done
up
in
a
black
veil
crape
too
i
have
just
recalled
it
effie
nodded
one
would
have
thought
i
resented
that
she
was
one
of
the
family
ah
that
it
she
thinks
she
is
one
of
the
family
oh
you
do
mean
that
forrie
where
was
lily
then
i
demanded
she
would
come
of
course
not
being
recognized
as
one
of
the
family
and
yet
counting
herself
one
but
explain
how
could
she
i
thought
that
was
broken
off
long
ago
when
mother
was
first
taken
effie
agreed
but
you
see
she
made
such
a
dead
set
at
him
she
had
to
keep
it
up
somehow
she
could
admit
that
forrie
had
wanted
her
so
they
made
it
up
between
them
lily
and
her
mother
i
mean
that
she
and
forrie
had
really
been
engaged
but
it
had
been
broken
off
because
forrie
could
marry
so
long
as
mother
she
broke
off
with
tears
again
remembering
how
mother
was
now
that
was
two
years
ago
you
do
mean
to
say
they
kept
it
up
all
the
time
they
had
to
you
see
lily
had
been
careful
about
not
getting
herself
talked
about
with
forester
oh
not
scandal
of
course
but
you
know
how
it
is
when
a
girl
is
crazy
after
a
man
everybody
gets
to
hear
of
it
and
then
they
had
to
make
so
much
of
the
engagement
never
coming
to
anything
on
mother
account
it
quite
spoiled
lily
chances
and
you
know
forester
oh
he
was
taken
in
by
it
no
doubt
it
was
something
to
sentimentalize
over
and
be
about
well
of
course
he
could
quite
abandon
the
poor
girl
and
she
really
fond
of
him
and
perfectly
safe
to
philander
with
well
now
that
he
has
no
one
depending
on
him
i
suppose
he
will
marry
her
that
what
is
worrying
me
protested
effie
you
see
it
all
depends
on
whether
i
go
on
depending
on
him
she
broke
down
over
that
mother
had
wanted
forester
to
marry
lily
jastrow
and
everybody
by
the
mouth
of
almira
jewett
had
thought
it
was
effie
duty
to
keep
him
from
it
if
she
could
and
i
could
by
just
staying
on
it
mother
money
in
the
business
your
and
mine
as
much
as
his
and
this
house
it
partly
ours
if
we
stay
in
it
well
if
you
to
effie
came
over
and
sobbed
on
my
shoulder
oh
i
do
she
said
i
suppose
it
is
horrid
and
selfish
i
fond
of
forrie
but
i
want
to
do
things
in
the
world
like
you
have
and
i
want
to
marry
and
have
babies
oh
oh
she
was
quite
overwhelmed
with
the
turpitude
of
it
you
shall
you
shall
i
determined
for
her
oh
olivia
i
have
you
so
i
knew
you
understand
it
was
all
right
so
long
as
mother
lived
i
could
do
anything
for
her
but
now
i
want
i
want
to
be
i
understood
very
well
what
that
want
was
but
first
off
i
had
to
explain
to
effie
why
i
could
take
her
with
me
it
was
wonderful
how
she
entered
into
my
feeling
about
my
work
and
my
lack
of
success
in
chicago
you
ought
to
go
to
new
york
you
be
a
great
tragic
actress
olive
i
know
you
could
go
too
if
you
could
get
your
share
out
of
the
business
you
could
have
mine
and
yours
she
glowed
over
it
but
the
fact
was
we
could
get
the
money
out
of
the
business
as
it
stood
we
could
have
sold
the
shop
for
what
mother
had
put
into
it
and
besides
we
should
have
had
to
deal
first
with
conviction
that
he
was
taking
care
of
our
shares
for
us
i
need
have
worried
about
effie
she
was
too
pretty
and
competent
not
to
have
arranged
for
herself
the
principal
and
his
wife
drove
over
from
montecito
to
say
that
they
would
be
glad
to
have
her
come
back
and
finish
the
course
interrupted
within
a
few
months
of
graduation
by
my
mother
illness
and
for
her
board
and
tuition
she
was
to
act
as
the
principal
secretary
within
a
year
she
wrote
that
she
was
engaged
to
their
son
in
the
meantime
i
undertook
to
stop
the
capacious
maw
of
forrie
need
of
being
important
and
the
only
way
i
saw
to
do
it
involved
my
surrender
of
any
hope
i
had
of
finding
my
own
release
in
what
my
mother
had
left
us
of
my
father
hard
won
savings
i
should
have
had
any
compunction
so
fierce
was
my
own
need
of
success
about
forcing
my
brother
hand
but
i
meant
definitely
not
to
leave
any
gap
in
his
life
for
effie
to
be
drawn
back
into
before
we
had
come
to
this
point
the
second
afternoon
after
the
funeral
in
fact
circumstances
had
begun
to
work
for
me
effie
and
i
looking
out
of
the
window
saw
jastrow
coming
along
by
the
front
fence
with
all
her
gentility
spread
as
it
were
by
the
feeling
she
had
of
her
call
on
us
being
a
diplomatic
function
she
coming
to
see
how
we
take
it
effie
averred
her
coming
to
the
funeral
as
one
of
the
family
well
how
do
we
take
it
effie
mother
could
bear
the
idea
of
it
tears
came
into
my
sister
eyes
i
could
see
the
wings
of
hovering
over
her
look
here
effie
you
go
and
take
home
endsleigh
spoons
there
had
been
so
many
out
of
town
connections
dropping
in
for
a
meal
that
we
had
been
obliged
to
fall
back
on
our
nearest
neighbour
lily
respectable
is
she
and
forester
has
encouraged
her
well
you
do
want
to
spoil
the
poor
girl
life
do
you
oh
said
effie
oh
olivia
i
could
see
she
was
torn
between
compunction
and
admiration
for
my
way
of
putting
it
on
high
moral
grounds
i
heard
her
counting
out
the
spoons
in
the
kitchen
as
i
went
to
let
jastrow
in
i
think
she
did
know
any
more
than
effie
did
what
to
make
of
my
manner
of
receiving
her
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
snivelled
a
little
into
a
handkerchief
which
was
evidently
her
husband
but
it
was
chiefly
i
could
see
because
she
had
come
prepared
to
snivel
and
could
quickly
adjust
herself
to
my
change
of
base
poor
lily
she
moaned
she
thought
such
a
lot
of
mother
but
i
tell
her
she
must
bear
up
she
must
indeed
i
assured
her
forester
needs
all
the
sympathy
he
can
get
just
now
i
could
see
her
peeping
over
the
top
of
her
handkerchief
trying
to
guess
what
to
make
of
that
but
the
sentimental
was
easy
for
her
that
what
i
tell
her
they
have
to
comfort
each
other
them
poor
young
things
they
ought
to
be
together
but
lily
so
sensitive
she
could
bear
to
put
herself
forward
i
tell
forrie
you
called
i
assured
her
jastrow
fanned
herself
with
her
damp
handkerchief
her
poor
little
pretence
broke
quite
down
under
my
friendliness
he
got
to
marry
her
she
whispered
lily
been
talked
about
and
he
i
could
guess
suddenly
what
it
meant
to
her
to
have
reached
up
so
desperately
for
something
better
for
her
daughter
than
she
had
been
able
to
manage
for
herself
and
to
come
so
near
not
getting
it
i
was
able
to
put
something
like
sympathy
into
my
voice
when
i
spoke
to
forester
at
supper
jastrow
called
she
says
lily
is
bearing
up
as
she
might
i
suppose
you
ought
to
go
and
see
her
effie
eyes
grew
round
at
me
over
the
teacups
but
after
all
forrie
did
know
what
had
passed
between
mother
and
me
in
regard
to
lily
if
i
chose
to
take
his
relation
to
her
as
a
matter
of
course
he
object
to
it
we
heard
forrie
in
his
room
changing
his
collar
before
he
went
back
to
the
shop
again
he
go
to
her
after
he
closes
up
effie
told
me
it
will
end
with
her
getting
him
so
long
as
he
does
get
you
but
it
was
unfair
to
put
ideas
like
that
in
effie
head
after
all
it
is
a
very
good
match
for
him
in
some
ways
she
always
look
up
to
him
and
that
is
what
forrie
needs
it
was
natural
to
effie
to
judge
every
situation
by
what
it
had
for
those
concerned
she
was
troubled
as
i
was
by
the
pressure
of
an
outside
ideal
by
the
end
of
a
month
when
i
thought
of
going
back
to
the
city
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
as
soon
as
convenient
forester
was
to
marry
lily
jastrow
he
meant
however
to
be
fair
with
us
both
about
the
property
he
had
given
us
notes
for
our
share
and
expected
to
pay
interest
the
note
was
negotiable
as
i
learned
immediately
and
the
interest
was
any
more
than
effie
would
need
for
her
clothing
i
felt
that
the
jaws
of
destiny
which
had
opened
to
let
effie
out
had
closed
on
me
instead
i
returned
to
chicago
early
in
november
my
place
with
the
coleman
players
had
long
been
filled
and
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
do
chapter
iv
jerry
play
which
had
had
its
premier
while
i
was
away
was
going
on
successfully
one
of
the
first
items
of
news
sarah
told
me
about
him
was
that
his
wife
was
expecting
another
child
undertaken
in
the
hope
that
if
she
could
hold
her
husband
roving
fancy
she
could
at
least
fix
his
attention
on
her
situation
all
that
she
had
got
out
of
it
so
far
was
a
reason
for
staying
at
home
which
left
jerry
the
freer
to
bestow
his
society
where
it
was
most
acceptable
does
she
know
miss
filette
i
mean
about
the
child
not
unless
jerry
has
told
her
which
he
hardly
do
sarah
laughed
a
little
and
that
was
not
usual
with
her
she
had
very
little
humour
fancy
is
so
up
in
the
air
about
the
success
of
the
play
she
thinks
she
inspired
it
i
imagine
they
feel
it
an
indelicacy
of
mcdermott
to
have
intruded
her
condition
on
their
relation
of
course
it
is
understood
that
there
nothing
really
wrong
about
it
it
is
wrong
if
his
wife
is
made
unhappy
by
it
i
had
sarah
reason
for
being
lenient
somebody
ought
to
speak
to
jerry
you
might
he
would
listen
to
you
it
is
just
because
there
is
so
little
in
it
that
it
is
so
hard
to
deal
with
i
suppose
i
took
to
interfering
in
the
mcdermott
affairs
because
i
had
so
little
of
my
own
to
interest
me
besides
i
was
fond
of
jerry
and
did
see
how
he
was
to
be
helped
by
getting
his
family
into
a
muddle
but
after
all
sarah
reminded
me
it
is
his
own
wife
and
his
own
inspiration
it
was
in
me
to
tell
her
even
if
i
had
understood
it
myself
at
the
time
that
the
secret
of
my
resentment
was
that
it
should
be
so
accepted
on
all
sides
that
one
must
choose
between
them
i
wanted
oh
i
immensely
wanted
what
jerry
was
getting
out
of
his
relation
to
miss
filette
but
i
wanted
it
free
of
the
implication
that
my
abandonment
of
my
husband
to
the
village
dressmaker
put
me
in
anything
like
the
same
case
the
real
trouble
with
you
jerry
told
me
is
that
you
are
trying
to
live
in
chicago
and
taylorville
at
the
same
time
not
being
able
to
make
any
headway
with
him
i
went
to
call
on
miss
filette
i
was
on
terms
with
her
that
would
admit
of
an
assault
on
her
confidence
i
did
know
her
well
enough
to
call
on
her
in
any
case
but
i
was
to
be
thwarted
of
good
intention
by
anything
so
small
as
a
breech
of
manners
in
doing
it
it
was
so
much
the
offense
of
my
undertaking
it
that
counted
i
found
as
miss
filette
determination
not
to
hear
anything
that
would
ruffle
the
surface
of
her
complacency
i
had
to
drop
plumb
into
my
revelation
out
of
the
opportunity
she
made
for
me
in
the
question
as
to
whether
the
play
would
or
would
not
go
on
the
road
before
christmas
i
should
hope
so
i
dropped
squarely
on
her
jerry
wife
needs
him
there
a
child
coming
in
april
yes
said
miss
filette
she
was
giving
me
tea
and
she
poised
the
second
lump
over
my
cup
with
an
inquiring
eyebrow
have
you
seen
what
we
have
done
with
the
second
act
lately
anyway
i
said
to
myself
as
i
went
she
knows
she
ca
skid
over
the
facts
as
she
has
my
telling
her
but
it
was
the
certainty
that
knowing
she
kept
right
on
with
jerry
that
drove
me
back
on
pauline
and
henry
mills
i
fled
to
them
to
be
saved
from
what
in
the
only
other
society
i
had
access
to
fretted
all
my
finer
instincts
to
be
ricocheted
by
them
again
on
to
that
reef
of
moral
squalour
upon
which
the
artist
and
woman
in
me
were
riven
asunder
what
i
should
have
done
was
to
take
my
courage
in
my
hands
and
have
gone
on
from
taylorville
to
new
york
but
the
most
i
was
equal
to
was
a
fixed
determination
to
accept
anything
which
would
take
me
nearer
broadway
which
even
then
was
to
the
player
world
all
that
the
lamp
is
to
the
moth
in
the
meantime
i
had
settled
in
two
housekeeping
rooms
in
a
street
that
i
would
have
dared
to
give
to
a
manager
as
an
address
one
of
those
neighbourhoods
where
there
are
always
a
great
many
perambulators
and
waste
paper
blowing
about
there
was
never
anything
for
me
in
the
frame
of
life
called
bohemian
more
than
a
picturesque
way
of
begging
the
question
of
poverty
what
i
looked
for
in
a
lodging
was
escape
from
the
bedraggled
professionalism
which
went
on
in
what
were
called
studios
by
means
of
a
cot
bed
an
oil
stove
and
a
few
yards
of
art
muslin
that
i
had
managed
it
so
successfully
as
i
hoped
was
made
plain
to
me
a
few
days
after
i
had
moved
in
by
the
discovery
of
a
card
tacked
on
the
opposite
door
that
read
leon
griffin
the
varieté
it
was
the
same
theatre
at
which
cecelia
brune
was
playing
the
chief
attraction
in
song
and
dance
in
the
glimpses
i
had
of
griffin
in
the
dark
hall
going
in
and
out
i
was
aware
that
he
gave
much
the
same
impression
of
unprofitable
use
that
was
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
shamrocks
all
this
time
i
kept
going
through
the
motions
of
looking
for
an
engagement
now
and
then
some
shining
bubble
of
opportunity
seemed
to
float
toward
me
to
dissolve
in
thin
air
as
soon
as
i
put
my
hand
out
to
it
one
of
these
brought
me
to
cline
and
erskine
waiting
room
on
the
day
that
cecelia
brune
elected
to
register
her
complaint
against
what
she
considered
a
slight
of
her
turn
at
the
varieté
she
flounced
about
more
than
a
little
not
to
let
the
rest
of
us
escape
the
inference
that
she
was
not
used
to
being
kept
waiting
when
she
had
hooked
and
unhooked
her
handsome
furs
for
the
fourth
time
she
introduced
me
to
leon
griffin
who
except
for
the
name
i
should
have
recognized
for
my
hall
neighbour
it
was
like
being
slapped
in
the
face
with
my
own
hard
condition
to
have
him
crowded
on
me
in
that
character
before
the
whole
roomful
life
seemed
so
to
have
beggared
him
in
broad
day
he
looked
the
sort
of
a
man
who
has
failed
to
sustain
himself
in
the
man
world
and
must
reinforce
his
value
with
the
favour
of
women
little
touches
of
effeminacy
about
his
dress
failed
to
take
the
attention
away
from
its
shabbiness
his
hair
had
the
traditional
thespian
curl
in
spite
of
being
cropped
short
to
allow
of
various
one
surmised
and
his
very
blue
eyes
were
in
a
perpetual
state
of
extenuating
the
meagreness
of
his
other
features
being
ashamed
of
my
shame
at
meeting
him
there
i
began
to
be
very
nice
to
him
cecelia
in
spite
of
her
magnificent
raiment
perhaps
on
account
of
it
had
been
disposed
to
graciousness
she
drew
us
together
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
she
ought
to
be
doin
on
broadway
she
introduced
me
handsomely
would
that
get
you
i
saw
you
with
the
hardings
last
year
griffin
assented
almost
as
though
i
might
think
it
a
liberty
where
are
you
playing
now
he
had
the
stamp
of
too
many
reverses
on
his
face
not
to
estimate
mine
at
its
proper
worth
he
had
fine
instincts
too
for
as
soon
as
i
told
him
that
i
was
out
of
an
engagement
that
season
he
put
himself
on
record
quite
simply
my
turn
goes
off
next
week
i
trying
to
get
cline
to
put
it
on
the
circuit
when
we
came
out
of
the
office
together
he
fell
into
step
with
me
one
of
the
young
women
ahead
of
us
made
the
shape
of
a
bubble
with
her
hands
and
blew
it
from
her
pouff
she
said
there
goes
another
of
my
chances
she
laughed
with
a
fine
courage
they
all
go
through
with
it
griffin
affirmed
there
eversley
i
have
forgotten
which
of
the
incidents
he
related
eversley
told
me
i
might
come
to
it
what
made
you
think
of
him
i
demanded
i
saw
his
name
in
the
paper
he
to
play
here
this
winter
he
a
wonder
he
said
wonderful
things
to
me
once
i
had
just
recalled
them
they
come
true
then
eversley
never
makes
a
mistake
why
i
remember
once
he
broke
off
as
though
he
had
changed
his
mind
about
telling
me
i
was
wondering
if
i
could
get
rid
of
him
by
stopping
in
at
sarah
when
he
broke
out
again
suddenly
to
think
of
you
being
out
of
an
engagement
and
a
girl
like
cecelia
brown
yes
i
know
her
name
is
brown
cissy
brown
of
milwaukee
i
always
suspected
it
i
admitted
but
it
is
her
looks
of
course
and
the
clothes
cecelia
has
lovely
clothes
well
so
could
you
if
he
checked
himself
i
do
mean
to
say
anything
against
a
lady
i
always
suspected
that
too
i
admitted
but
one
does
like
to
say
it
well
you
know
what
she
gets
a
week
a
girl
does
wear
diamond
sunbursts
on
that
griffin
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
sort
of
man
it
is
that
gives
diamond
sunbursts
to
variety
girls
i
never
seen
any
of
them
you
have
probably
but
you
do
know
it
you
meet
their
wives
in
society
henry
mills
i
do
know
what
made
me
say
it
the
image
of
him
came
tripping
along
the
surface
of
my
mind
and
slid
off
my
tongue
without
having
more
than
momentarily
perched
there
is
he
in
business
downtown
and
has
he
got
a
perfectly
proper
family
and
too
many
dinners
under
his
vest
mills
home
life
is
ideal
but
i
did
mean
neither
did
i
but
that
the
type
they
mostly
have
ideal
families
but
they
could
live
up
to
them
if
they
did
have
cecelia
brunes
on
the
side
i
beg
your
pardon
he
had
looked
up
and
caught
me
blushing
a
deep
painful
red
but
it
was
on
account
of
what
he
had
intimated
i
was
blushing
because
of
the
discovery
in
myself
of
needs
which
compared
to
the
ideal
of
life
i
had
set
for
myself
were
as
much
of
a
defection
as
anything
our
conversation
had
suggested
for
henry
mills
i
was
conscious
in
those
days
of
a
slow
steady
seepage
of
all
my
forces
toward
desperation
you
have
to
take
a
company
out
for
yourself
was
jerry
solution
i
write
you
a
play
i
got
a
ripping
idea
a
man
with
a
gift
and
two
women
good
women
both
of
them
that
where
i
score
against
the
eternal
triangle
each
of
them
trying
to
save
him
from
the
other
and
breaking
him
between
them
jerry
plays
were
never
anything
more
than
dramatizations
of
his
immediate
experience
you
and
sarah
croyden
you
set
each
other
off
i
write
it
for
both
of
you
he
walked
up
and
down
in
my
little
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
shining
black
hair
rising
like
quills
jerry
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
write
that
play
and
how
much
will
it
cost
to
produce
it
ten
thousand
dollars
he
answered
to
the
last
question
about
eighteen
months
if
i
go
right
at
it
and
i
money
enough
to
last
me
to
the
end
of
february
no
to
his
swift
generous
gesture
you
have
to
live
eighteen
months
on
yours
and
another
child
coming
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
should
have
to
speak
to
pauline
and
henry
mills
greater
than
any
mystery
of
creative
art
to
me
is
the
mystery
by
which
the
recipients
of
its
benefits
manage
to
keep
ignorant
of
its
essential
processes
i
have
never
been
able
to
figure
to
myself
how
pauline
and
henry
escaped
knowing
that
the
creative
mood
the
keen
hunger
of
which
is
more
importunate
than
any
need
of
food
or
raiment
was
to
be
had
for
very
little
more
than
they
spent
fattening
their
souls
on
its
choice
products
for
it
is
always
to
be
bought
it
is
the
distinction
of
genius
as
against
talent
always
to
know
in
what
far
unlikely
market
the
precious
commodity
is
to
be
bought
how
was
it
that
henry
escaped
knowing
that
the
appealing
femininity
which
plays
so
large
a
part
in
the
success
of
an
actress
with
an
audience
of
millses
is
largely
the
result
of
having
been
the
object
of
that
solicitious
protection
which
it
is
supposed
to
provoke
with
what
since
it
was
agreed
between
pauline
and
me
that
i
was
not
to
pay
down
on
that
counter
what
cecelia
and
jerry
parted
with
cheerfully
was
i
ultimately
to
pay
for
it
now
that
i
had
on
all
sides
of
me
the
witness
of
desperation
i
began
to
be
irritated
at
the
way
in
which
in
view
of
our
long
friendship
they
accepted
it
for
me
as
the
holiday
season
approached
without
any
change
in
my
circumstances
other
than
a
steady
diminution
of
my
bank
account
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
possible
move
was
toward
new
york
and
that
i
should
have
to
ask
henry
to
advance
me
the
money
for
it
in
view
of
what
came
to
me
afterward
it
was
a
reasonable
proposition
but
i
reckoned
without
that
extraordinary
blankness
to
the
processes
of
art
which
is
common
to
those
most
entertained
by
it
it
was
a
day
or
two
after
christmas
from
which
i
had
been
excused
by
my
recent
bereavement
that
i
went
out
to
dinner
there
with
the
determination
to
bring
something
to
pass
commensurate
with
their
usual
attitude
of
high
admiration
for
and
confidence
in
my
gift
we
had
gone
into
the
library
after
dinner
at
least
it
was
a
room
that
went
by
that
name
though
i
do
know
for
what
reason
except
that
henry
smoked
there
and
the
furniture
was
upholstered
in
leather
as
in
evanston
it
was
indispensable
that
all
libraries
should
be
here
and
there
were
touches
that
suggested
that
if
henry
moved
his
income
up
a
notch
or
two
pauline
taste
might
not
be
able
to
keep
pace
with
it
henry
warmed
his
back
at
the
gas
log
and
wished
to
know
how
things
went
with
me
as
well
as
i
could
expect
them
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
for
new
york
as
soon
as
i
can
manage
it
what
the
matter
with
chicago
henry
manner
implied
that
whatever
you
believed
about
it
you
have
to
show
him
well
i
have
to
be
capitalized
to
do
anything
here
the
same
as
in
new
york
and
the
field
there
is
larger
i
went
on
to
explain
something
of
what
the
metropolis
had
to
offer
i
guess
the
worst
thing
about
chicago
is
that
you
out
of
a
job
people
do
get
sore
on
a
place
where
they
are
doing
well
no
they
generally
light
out
for
a
place
where
there
are
more
jobs
i
thought
i
should
get
on
better
if
i
took
henry
in
his
own
key
but
he
forged
ahead
of
me
if
there
anything
the
matter
with
your
acting
why
do
you
ask
somebody
there
nobody
to
ask
besides
there
is
anything
the
matter
with
it
the
matter
is
with
me
well
i
must
say
i
do
see
the
difference
oh
i
cried
i
had
realized
that
they
would
just
take
my
word
for
it
it
is
because
i
am
empty
empty
i
trailed
off
seeing
how
wide
i
was
of
his
understanding
i
should
have
questioned
henry
mills
word
about
the
capitalization
of
a
joint
stock
company
and
i
resented
their
discounting
my
own
statement
of
my
difficulties
pauline
got
hold
of
my
hand
and
patted
it
i
wondered
if
it
was
because
all
her
own
crises
were
complicated
with
henry
mills
that
she
always
thought
that
affectionateness
was
part
of
the
answer
it
is
only
that
with
all
your
gift
henry
ca
understand
how
you
need
anything
else
she
extenuated
i
need
food
and
clothes
i
blurted
out
pretty
soon
i
shall
need
a
lodging
oh
my
dear
pauline
was
shocked
at
the
indelicacy
i
do
know
if
she
did
understand
how
poor
i
was
or
if
it
was
only
the
general
notion
of
the
sheltered
woman
to
find
in
complaint
a
kind
of
heresy
against
the
institution
by
which
they
are
maintained
after
all
she
caught
up
with
her
accustomed
moral
attitude
there
a
kind
of
nobility
in
suffering
for
your
art
it
what
gives
you
your
spiritual
quality
i
thought
i
recognized
the
phrase
as
one
that
was
current
in
the
women
clubs
of
that
period
i
took
hold
of
my
courage
desperately
well
i
offering
you
a
chance
to
suffer
two
thousand
dollars
worth
pauline
tact
was
proof
even
against
that
you
comedy
child
she
laughed
indulgently
you
getting
ideas
henry
burbled
on
cheerfully
all
these
and
you
been
associating
with
they
filled
you
up
that
friend
of
yours
mcdermott
somebody
had
him
to
the
club
the
other
day
talking
about
the
conservation
of
genius
nothing
in
it
let
them
work
for
their
money
the
same
as
other
people
i
say
you
know
you
did
have
any
money
to
begin
with
pauline
reminded
me
i
was
made
to
feel
it
a
consideration
that
she
had
pressed
the
point
that
if
i
could
do
again
what
i
had
done
then
there
was
something
lacking
in
the
application
they
must
have
taken
my
gesture
of
despair
for
surrender
i
guess
you
were
just
getting
it
out
of
your
system
henry
surmised
comfortably
it
was
not
the
first
nor
the
last
time
that
i
was
to
come
squarely
up
against
the
lay
conviction
that
whatever
might
be
known
about
the
processes
of
art
it
was
the
artist
that
knew
it
later
when
henry
took
me
out
to
the
car
he
came
round
to
what
had
been
back
of
the
whole
conversation
i
suppose
you
could
use
more
money
in
your
business
most
of
us
could
he
advised
me
but
you
do
want
to
let
people
find
it
out
nothing
turns
men
against
a
woman
so
much
as
to
have
her
always
thinking
about
money
it
was
a
very
cold
night
as
i
came
down
the
side
street
to
my
door
deserted
as
a
country
road
the
narrow
footpath
trodden
in
the
pavement
looked
like
the
track
of
desolation
the
cold
flare
of
the
lamps
was
smothered
in
sodden
splashes
of
snow
there
had
been
the
feeling
of
uneasiness
in
the
air
that
goes
before
a
storm
all
that
forenoon
and
in
the
interval
that
i
had
been
revaluing
a
lifelong
friendship
in
terms
of
what
it
would
do
for
me
it
had
settled
down
to
a
heavy
clogging
snow
i
was
startled
as
i
turned
in
at
the
entry
to
find
a
man
behind
me
he
had
come
up
unsuspected
in
the
soft
shuffle
and
turned
in
with
me
by
the
light
that
filtered
through
the
transom
i
saw
that
he
was
griffin
of
the
varieté
now
as
i
fumbled
blindly
at
the
latch
he
came
close
to
me
beg
pardon
he
had
put
out
his
hand
over
mine
and
turned
the
key
for
me
my
fingers
are
so
cold
i
apologized
i
turned
my
face
toward
him
with
the
stiffness
of
cold
and
tears
upon
it
and
there
was
an
answering
commiseration
in
his
eyes
i
reached
out
for
the
key
and
he
took
my
hand
in
his
holding
it
to
his
breast
with
a
movement
of
excluding
human
kindness
if
the
gesture
was
at
all
theatrical
i
did
not
feel
it
i
let
him
hold
it
there
for
a
moment
before
i
went
in
and
shut
the
door
chapter
v
depression
as
well
as
the
storm
which
held
on
heavily
all
night
and
the
next
day
kept
me
close
and
the
state
of
my
coal
bin
kept
me
in
bed
most
of
the
next
day
along
late
in
the
afternoon
i
was
aroused
from
a
lethargy
of
cold
and
crying
by
leon
griffin
tapping
at
the
door
to
know
how
i
did
the
snow
by
this
time
had
settled
down
to
a
blinding
drift
and
the
thermometer
had
fallen
into
an
incalculable
void
of
cold
griffin
was
in
his
overcoat
as
though
he
had
just
come
in
or
was
just
going
out
though
i
learned
later
he
had
been
sitting
in
it
all
day
in
his
room
the
impression
it
created
of
his
being
in
the
act
of
passing
led
me
to
open
my
door
to
him
as
i
otherwise
might
not
have
done
a
terrible
cold
blast
came
in
with
him
and
a
clattering
of
the
shutters
on
the
windward
wall
of
the
house
outside
the
day
was
falling
dusk
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
but
the
square
blank
of
the
window
curtained
by
the
sliding
screen
of
snow
and
my
little
stove
which
glowed
like
a
carbuncle
in
its
corner
you
cozy
here
he
put
it
as
an
excuse
for
lingering
for
i
asked
him
to
have
a
chair
you
hardly
feel
the
wind
on
my
side
a
trail
of
snow
half
across
the
room
where
the
wind
whips
it
in
between
the
casings
though
he
had
come
ostensibly
to
offer
me
a
neighbourly
attention
he
was
plainly
in
need
of
it
himself
it
was
his
last
night
at
the
varieté
and
between
the
storm
and
the
depression
of
having
nothing
to
turn
to
he
was
coming
down
with
a
cold
i
had
him
into
my
one
easy
chair
and
suggested
tea
i
hardly
slept
any
last
night
he
apologized
over
his
second
cup
the
shutter
clacks
so
i
could
hear
it
now
like
the
stroke
of
desolation
that
night
when
i
heard
him
stamping
off
the
snow
in
the
hall
i
had
a
hot
drink
for
him
but
when
i
saw
him
by
the
rakish
light
of
the
hall
lamp
wringing
his
hands
with
the
cold
before
taking
it
i
insisted
he
should
come
on
into
my
still
warm
room
i
had
to
turn
back
first
to
light
my
own
lamp
and
in
respect
to
my
being
in
my
dressing
gown
with
my
hair
in
two
braids
to
slip
into
my
bedroom
and
experience
as
i
looked
back
at
him
through
the
crack
in
the
door
the
kind
of
softening
a
woman
has
toward
a
man
she
has
made
comfortable
the
light
of
my
lamp
which
was
shaded
for
reading
like
a
miniature
calcium
brought
out
for
me
the
frayed
edge
of
his
overcoat
and
all
the
waste
and
misuse
of
him
the
kind
of
faded
appeal
that
sort
of
man
has
for
a
woman
forlorn
as
he
was
as
he
put
the
bowl
back
on
the
table
i
was
so
much
more
forlorn
myself
that
i
was
glad
to
have
been
femininely
of
use
to
him
pauline
wrote
me
to
come
out
and
stay
with
her
during
the
protracted
cold
spell
but
owing
to
the
difficulty
in
delivery
the
invitation
failed
to
reach
me
until
the
severity
of
the
weather
was
abated
in
any
case
i
was
still
too
sore
at
what
seemed
to
me
the
betrayal
of
my
long
confidence
to
have
been
willing
to
have
subjected
myself
to
any
reminders
of
it
and
whatever
kindness
pauline
meant
it
could
hardly
have
done
so
much
for
me
as
leon
griffin
did
by
just
needing
me
it
transpired
that
he
had
no
stove
in
his
room
and
the
heat
from
the
register
for
which
we
were
definitely
charged
in
the
rent
scarcely
modified
the
edge
of
the
cold
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
we
spent
much
of
the
time
huddled
over
my
stove
snow
ceased
to
fall
on
the
second
day
and
nothing
moved
in
our
view
except
now
and
then
the
surface
of
it
was
flung
up
by
the
wind
falling
again
into
the
waste
of
the
untrampled
housetops
that
stretched
from
my
window
to
the
icy
flat
of
the
lake
darkening
under
a
dour
horizon
somehow
though
i
had
never
been
willing
to
confess
to
my
friends
how
poor
i
was
i
made
no
bones
of
it
with
griff
as
i
had
heard
cecelia
call
him
a
name
that
seemed
somehow
to
suit
the
inconsequential
nature
of
our
relation
better
than
his
proper
title
we
frankly
pooled
our
funds
in
the
matter
of
food
which
one
or
another
of
us
slipped
out
to
buy
and
cooked
on
my
stove
i
took
an
interest
in
preparing
it
such
as
i
had
since
the
times
when
i
imagined
i
was
helping
tommy
on
the
way
to
growing
rich
and
when
the
room
was
full
of
a
warm
savoury
smell
and
the
table
pulled
out
from
the
wall
to
make
it
serve
for
two
we
felt
for
the
time
restored
to
the
graciousness
of
living
we
fell
back
on
the
uses
of
domesticity
by
association
providing
us
with
a
sense
of
life
going
on
in
orderliness
and
stability
it
came
out
for
me
in
these
moments
that
it
is
after
all
life
that
art
needs
rather
than
feeling
and
that
to
a
woman
of
my
capacity
was
to
be
supplied
not
by
innocuous
intrigues
like
jerry
but
by
the
normal
procedure
of
living
i
believe
i
felt
myself
rather
of
a
better
stripe
to
find
it
so
in
the
domestic
proceeding
though
i
do
not
really
know
that
my
necessity
was
any
whit
superior
to
miss
filette
except
in
offering
the
minimum
possibility
of
making
anybody
unhappy
by
it
but
because
i
knew
my
friends
would
think
it
ridiculous
that
i
could
lay
hold
of
power
again
by
so
inconsiderable
a
handle
as
leon
griffin
i
suffered
a
corroding
resentment
griffin
was
getting
up
a
new
act
for
himself
and
evenings
as
i
helped
him
with
it
i
felt
a
faint
stirring
of
creative
power
when
he
had
finished
i
would
take
the
shade
off
the
lamp
and
render
scenes
for
him
from
my
favourite
elizabethan
drama
and
in
the
face
of
his
unqualified
admiration
for
me
i
could
almost
act
toward
the
end
of
the
week
as
the
cold
abated
griffin
asked
me
to
see
a
play
in
which
some
of
his
friends
were
playing
and
jerry
being
prodigal
of
favours
i
responded
with
an
invitation
to
the
futurist
i
had
mentioned
griff
to
sarah
i
never
more
than
mentioned
him
to
any
of
my
friends
but
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
not
speak
of
them
to
him
especially
when
they
were
so
much
upon
the
public
tongue
as
sarah
was
just
then
croyden
he
said
is
that
an
unusual
name
he
appeared
to
be
puzzling
over
it
i
seem
to
remember
a
town
somewhere
by
that
name
in
new
york
i
told
him
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
him
how
sarah
came
by
it
but
an
impulse
of
discretion
saved
me
i
had
seen
the
futurist
so
many
times
now
that
once
at
the
theatre
i
occupied
myself
with
looking
at
the
audience
and
took
no
sort
of
notice
of
my
escort
until
after
sarah
entrance
near
the
close
of
the
first
act
well
i
laid
myself
open
to
compliments
for
my
friend
i
was
startled
by
what
i
saw
when
i
looked
at
him
he
had
shrunk
away
into
the
corner
of
his
seat
farthest
from
me
like
a
man
whose
garment
had
fallen
from
him
unawares
the
stark
naked
soul
of
him
fed
visibly
upon
her
bodily
perfection
sarah
beauty
took
men
like
that
sometimes
when
they
were
able
to
see
it
there
were
those
who
thought
her
merely
i
could
see
his
tongue
moving
about
stealthily
to
wet
his
dry
lips
i
could
bear
to
look
at
him
like
that
it
seemed
a
pitiful
thing
for
a
man
to
ache
so
with
the
beauty
of
a
woman
he
had
long
ceased
to
deserve
it
was
as
though
he
had
laid
bare
some
secret
ache
in
me
coming
out
of
the
theatre
he
surprised
me
with
a
knowledge
of
affairs
he
knew
that
she
had
begun
with
i
played
with
him
myself
he
admitted
that
was
before
miss
miss
croyden
i
supplied
that
was
the
town
she
came
from
i
have
told
you
except
that
you
seem
to
know
i
was
expecting
another
name
was
she
was
she
married
once
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
lawrence
oh
well
you
may
call
it
married
he
was
a
cur
you
ca
tell
me
anything
about
him
worse
than
i
know
myself
from
the
earnestness
of
his
tone
i
judged
that
he
had
suffered
something
at
the
hands
of
lawrence
but
i
say
this
for
him
he
did
stay
with
the
other
woman
she
followed
him
and
found
him
but
he
would
stay
with
her
i
do
see
that
that
proves
anything
except
that
he
was
the
greater
scoundrel
the
other
woman
was
his
wife
it
proves
that
he
loved
miss
croyden
best
that
he
could
bear
the
other
woman
after
her
i
thought
it
was
no
use
matching
ethical
ideals
with
him
and
i
let
the
matter
drop
it
came
back
to
me
next
day
that
if
he
had
been
with
in
lawrence
time
he
might
have
known
something
of
the
other
shamrocks
i
meant
to
ask
him
about
it
in
the
morning
but
put
it
off
as
i
observed
that
the
recollection
of
it
seemed
to
have
stirred
him
past
the
point
of
being
able
to
sleep
he
was
pale
in
the
morning
and
the
rings
under
his
eyes
stood
out
plainly
he
had
the
whipped
look
of
a
man
who
has
been
so
long
accused
of
misdemeanour
that
he
comes
at
last
to
believe
he
has
done
it
i
could
see
the
impulse
to
confess
hovering
over
him
and
the
hope
that
i
might
find
in
his
misbehaviours
the
excusing
clue
which
he
was
vaguely
aware
must
be
there
but
could
himself
lay
hands
on
i
suppose
souls
in
the
pit
must
have
movements
like
that
seeking
in
one
another
the
extenuations
they
ca
admit
to
themselves
we
did
however
strike
the
note
of
confidence
until
it
was
evening
griffin
kept
up
the
form
of
looking
for
an
engagement
which
occupied
his
morning
hours
and
in
the
afternoon
jerry
came
in
to
see
how
i
had
come
through
the
cold
spell
and
to
win
my
interest
with
his
wife
to
consent
to
his
going
as
far
as
louis
with
the
futurist
i
forget
what
reasons
he
had
for
thinking
it
advisable
except
that
they
were
all
more
or
less
complicated
with
miss
filette
but
heavens
jerry
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
freemasonry
of
women
how
can
you
think
my
sympathies
would
be
with
your
wife
especially
in
her
condition
it
only
for
a
week
and
you
know
except
for
her
fussing
she
is
perfectly
well
and
look
here
olivia
you
know
exactly
why
i
have
to
have
other
things
why
i
ca
just
settle
down
to
being
the
plain
head
of
the
family
his
tone
was
accusing
i
know
why
you
you
have
to
honest
jerry
is
it
so
imperative
as
all
that
honest
to
god
olivia
unless
i
interested
i
ca
write
a
word
his
glance
travelling
over
my
dull
little
room
and
makeshift
furniture
the
cheap
kerosene
lamp
the
broken
hinge
of
the
stove
you
ought
to
know
he
drove
it
home
to
me
i
felt
myself
involved
by
my
toleration
of
griffin
in
a
queer
kind
of
complicity
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
tell
her
you
think
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
the
play
for
me
to
be
there
in
louis
for
the
opening
it
always
good
for
an
interview
and
that
advertising
after
all
i
suppose
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
had
found
his
wife
in
a
wrapper
at
four
in
the
afternoon
when
i
went
out
there
if
she
would
make
any
better
fight
for
herself
who
was
i
to
fight
for
her
and
as
jerry
said
for
him
to
be
with
the
play
meant
advertising
i
talked
it
over
with
griffin
that
evening
as
we
sat
humped
over
my
tiny
stove
before
the
lamps
were
lighted
outside
we
could
see
the
roofs
huddling
together
with
the
cold
and
far
beyond
the
thin
line
of
the
lake
beaten
white
with
the
wind
in
a
fury
of
it
made
me
think
of
poor
little
gerald
under
the
lash
of
her
vagaries
i
ca
help
think
that
she
feel
it
less
if
she
made
less
fuss
about
it
i
protested
griffin
shook
his
head
it
a
mercy
she
can
do
that
it
when
you
ca
do
anything
it
eats
into
you
i
reflected
there
was
a
woman
i
knew
who
looked
like
that
leading
lady
she
was
jealous
and
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
she
looked
gnawed
upon
miss
dean
you
mean
i
forgot
you
said
that
you
knew
her
i
wanted
immensely
to
know
how
he
came
to
be
mixed
up
with
her
she
was
jealous
of
me
but
there
was
no
cause
how
well
did
you
know
her
i
she
i
was
married
to
her
his
face
was
mottled
with
embarrassment
it
occurred
to
me
that
his
confusion
must
have
been
for
his
complicity
in
the
fact
of
their
not
being
married
now
but
he
set
me
right
i
ought
to
have
told
it
on
her
i
suppose
she
married
me
to
go
on
the
stage
i
was
boarding
at
her
mother
and
i
could
have
afforded
to
marry
unless
she
had
you
do
know
how
handsome
she
was
i
knew
she
could
act
i
ca
myself
but
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
her
father
had
been
an
actor
of
a
sort
he
had
taught
her
things
and
i
thought
i
could
pull
her
along
she
got
on
i
let
the
fact
stand
for
all
it
was
worth
yes
she
had
something
almost
as
good
as
acting
she
could
get
hold
of
people
she
had
was
it
on
his
account
you
separated
long
before
that
you
see
she
could
handle
the
managers
in
her
own
interest
but
she
did
know
what
to
do
with
me
so
i
i
got
out
of
her
way
griffin
clothes
were
too
loose
for
him
and
his
hair
which
wanted
trimming
disposed
itself
in
what
came
perilously
near
to
being
ringlets
accentuating
the
effect
of
his
having
been
shrivelled
and
shrunk
within
the
mark
of
his
capacity
there
was
a
certain
shame
about
him
as
he
made
this
admission
that
made
me
feel
that
though
to
leave
his
wife
free
to
seek
her
own
sort
of
success
had
been
a
generous
thing
to
do
it
was
all
he
could
do
his
moral
nature
had
suffered
an
incurable
strain
griff
did
they
tell
you
when
you
were
young
that
love
was
all
bound
up
with
what
you
should
do
in
the
world
and
what
you
could
get
for
it
they
never
told
me
anything
i
had
to
find
it
out
jerry
too
he
thought
he
was
going
to
have
a
graceful
docile
creature
to
keep
him
in
a
perpetual
state
of
maleness
i
should
have
thought
you
have
left
the
stage
after
that
i
said
reverting
to
the
personal
instance
i
ought
to
have
but
somehow
i
kept
feeling
her
even
when
i
thinking
of
her
i
could
feel
her
somewhere
pulling
me
it
was
like
living
in
the
house
where
some
one
has
died
and
you
keep
thinking
they
just
in
the
next
room
and
you
do
want
to
go
away
for
fear
you
lose
them
altogether
i
understand
the
afternoon
light
had
withdrawn
into
the
bleak
sky
without
illuminating
it
i
threw
open
the
stove
for
the
sake
of
the
ruddy
light
and
the
intimacy
of
our
sitting
there
drew
me
on
to
counter
confession
it
like
that
with
me
all
the
time
i
said
only
there
has
really
been
anybody
sarah
says
there
does
have
to
be
anybody
that
we
only
think
so
because
we
have
felt
it
that
way
once
she
thinks
it
is
just
personality
whatever
there
is
that
we
act
to
well
i
know
you
have
to
have
it
anyway
you
can
get
it
used
to
call
it
feeling
your
job
i
wonder
where
he
is
now
so
the
talk
drifted
off
to
the
perpetual
professionalism
of
the
unsuccessful
to
incidents
of
rehearsals
and
engagements
i
believe
it
would
have
been
good
for
me
to
have
run
my
mind
in
new
pastures
but
there
was
nobody
to
open
the
gates
for
me
i
said
as
much
to
sarah
the
very
next
time
i
saw
her
it
seemed
a
way
of
getting
at
what
i
had
yet
told
her
that
i
was
within
a
week
or
two
of
the
end
of
my
means
i
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
not
calling
my
case
to
her
attention
in
the
readiness
with
which
she
offered
herself
to
my
necessity
you
must
go
to
new
york
of
course
i
three
hundred
dollars
and
i
could
send
you
something
every
month
i
cut
her
off
absolutely
i
rather
try
cecelia
brune
plan
first
i
assured
her
not
while
you
have
me
she
was
firm
with
me
besides
you
really
know
that
cecelia
did
buy
her
diamond
sunburst
on
a
week
i
told
her
all
that
griffin
had
said
sarah
looked
worried
i
tell
you
about
the
diamonds
about
a
year
ago
while
you
were
with
the
hardings
she
got
into
trouble
oh
she
loved
him
as
much
as
she
was
able
he
gave
her
the
diamonds
but
cecelia
cared
and
then
when
the
trouble
came
he
deserted
her
that
what
cecelia
could
understand
she
had
never
given
anything
before
and
she
did
realize
that
that
had
been
her
chief
advantage
it
gave
her
a
scare
but
in
spite
of
sarah
confidence
in
cecelia
bitter
experience
keeping
her
straight
i
could
see
that
she
had
taken
what
griffin
had
told
me
to
heart
a
day
or
two
later
she
referred
to
the
matter
again
if
she
goes
over
the
line
once
and
does
have
to
pay
for
it
she
is
lost
she
was
standing
at
my
window
looking
out
over
the
roofs
and
chimneys
cased
in
ice
and
she
might
for
all
the
mark
her
profession
has
left
on
her
been
looking
across
the
pasture
bars
i
was
irritated
at
her
detachment
and
her
interest
in
the
face
of
my
own
problem
in
an
affair
so
unrelated
as
cecelia
brune
why
do
you
care
so
much
you
care
too
if
you
had
seen
as
much
of
her
it
like
watching
a
drowning
man
you
do
stop
to
ask
if
he
worth
it
before
you
plunge
in
i
ca
swim
myself
i
protested
i
did
want
to
be
dragged
in
rescuing
cecelia
i
had
myself
to
save
and
was
sure
i
could
do
it
it
was
after
this
talk
however
that
griff
who
still
hung
about
the
varieté
from
habit
told
me
that
sarah
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
stopping
to
pick
up
cecelia
on
her
way
home
from
her
own
theatre
he
thought
it
a
futile
performance
nothing
can
stop
that
kind
they
do
always
know
it
but
that
what
draws
them
to
the
stage
in
the
first
place
it
a
kind
of
going
back
to
the
thing
they
were
a
long
time
ago
atavism
i
supplied
i
thought
it
very
likely
all
the
centuries
of
bringing
women
up
to
be
toys
must
have
had
its
fruit
somehow
cecelia
was
made
to
be
played
with
she
was
serviceable
for
anything
else
and
what
was
more
i
did
care
to
be
identified
with
her
even
in
the
christian
attitude
of
a
rescuer
i
said
as
much
to
sarah
one
evening
about
a
week
later
when
i
had
gone
with
jerry
to
give
my
opinion
of
some
changes
in
the
cast
preparatory
to
going
on
the
road
with
his
play
and
in
the
overflow
of
his
satisfaction
at
the
way
the
audience
rose
to
them
he
had
asked
me
to
go
to
supper
with
him
then
as
sarah
joined
us
and
the
spirit
of
the
crowd
caught
him
pouring
along
the
street
bright
almost
as
by
day
and
with
the
added
brightness
of
evening
garments
jerry
always
open
to
the
infection
of
the
holiday
mood
proposed
that
for
once
we
stretch
a
point
by
going
to
supper
at
reeves
sarah
and
i
demurred
as
women
will
at
such
a
proposal
from
a
man
whose
family
exigencies
are
known
to
them
but
sarah
found
a
prohibitory
objection
in
a
promise
she
professed
to
have
made
to
go
around
for
cecelia
on
her
way
home
which
jerry
promptly
quashed
by
including
her
in
the
invitation
i
protested
supper
at
reeves
is
quite
enough
of
an
adventure
for
one
time
cecelia
paints
not
really
sarah
protested
it
only
that
she
uses
so
little
that
she
does
think
it
necessary
to
take
it
off
all
the
better
insisted
jerry
i
never
did
take
supper
at
with
a
painted
lady
and
i
told
it
is
quite
one
of
the
things
to
do
i
let
it
pass
rather
than
spoil
his
high
mood
it
was
not
more
than
three
blocks
to
the
varieté
and
at
the
stage
door
sarah
insisted
on
getting
out
herself
why
did
you
let
her
i
protested
to
jerry
because
it
will
please
her
and
miss
brune
will
be
gone
sarah
realize
how
late
we
are
i
could
see
her
returning
through
the
fogged
glass
of
the
stage
door
cecelia
gone
the
man
said
she
was
going
to
reeves
too
we
can
pick
her
up
there
oh
i
objected
i
can
stand
cecelia
but
i
draw
the
line
at
her
gentleman
friends
she
did
go
there
alone
i
fancy
we
have
a
look
at
him
anyway
before
we
give
him
the
glad
hand
jerry
temporized
the
cab
discharged
us
into
the
press
of
men
and
women
that
at
that
hour
poured
steadily
into
the
anteroom
of
reeves
which
was
level
with
the
pavement
divided
from
it
by
a
screen
of
plate
glass
and
palms
beyond
that
and
raised
by
a
few
steps
was
the
palm
room
flanked
on
either
side
by
dressing
rooms
and
opening
out
back
the
great
revolving
doors
muffled
with
crimson
curtains
that
received
the
guests
and
sorted
them
like
a
hopper
according
to
the
degree
of
their
resistance
to
the
particular
allurements
of
reeves
there
was
a
sleek
attendant
who
swung
the
leaves
of
the
door
at
just
the
right
angle
that
inducted
you
to
the
public
café
or
to
the
corridor
that
led
to
private
rooms
and
was
famed
never
to
have
made
a
mistake
jerry
dared
us
hilariously
as
we
went
up
the
steps
to
put
his
discrimination
to
the
test
you
and
i
alone
then
olivia
black
dress
would
give
us
away
sarah
insisted
i
want
you
to
stay
here
and
watch
for
cecelia
she
whispered
to
me
i
must
see
her
i
her
going
on
with
jerry
would
give
her
an
opportunity
to
look
through
the
café
if
cecelia
had
already
arrived
i
would
be
sure
to
see
her
come
in
with
the
crowd
that
broke
against
the
bank
of
palms
into
two
streams
of
bright
and
dark
proceeding
to
the
dressing
rooms
and
returning
by
twos
and
threes
to
be
swallowed
up
by
the
hopper
turning
half
unseen
behind
its
velvet
curtains
i
slipped
behind
a
group
of
women
waiting
for
their
escorts
under
the
palms
i
was
hypnotized
by
the
movement
and
the
glitter
i
believe
i
forgot
what
i
was
looking
for
and
all
at
once
she
was
before
me
the
theatrical
quality
of
cecelia
prettiness
and
the
length
of
her
plumes
would
have
picked
her
out
anywhere
even
without
the
blackened
rim
of
the
eyelids
and
the
air
she
had
always
of
having
just
stepped
into
the
spot
light
she
had
stationed
herself
with
her
professional
instinct
for
effect
just
under
the
australian
fern
tree
waiting
for
her
escort
and
in
the
moment
it
took
me
to
gather
myself
together
he
joined
her
i
had
come
up
behind
cecelia
and
was
brought
face
to
face
with
him
it
was
until
he
had
wheeled
into
step
with
her
that
he
saw
me
and
his
face
went
mottled
all
at
once
and
settled
to
a
slow
purple
cecelia
was
magnificent
oh
you
here
how
de
do
she
slipped
her
hand
under
her
escort
arm
and
sailed
out
with
him
i
caught
the
glint
of
the
door
under
the
curtains
i
do
know
how
long
i
stood
staring
before
i
started
after
her
to
be
met
by
the
leaves
of
the
revolving
door
which
reversing
its
motion
projected
sarah
and
jerry
into
the
palm
room
beside
me
i
have
been
all
over
the
café
sarah
began
did
you
meet
her
in
the
café
i
was
just
telling
you
no
no
in
the
corridor
just
now
they
went
through
but
they
could
urged
sarah
i
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
café
with
jerry
the
truth
of
the
situation
began
to
dawn
on
her
there
such
a
crowd
of
course
you
missed
her
jerry
began
to
build
up
a
probability
by
which
we
could
sustain
sarah
through
the
supper
which
followed
we
all
of
us
talked
a
great
deal
as
people
will
when
they
are
anxious
not
to
talk
of
a
particular
thing
when
we
were
in
the
dressing
room
again
putting
on
our
wraps
sarah
turned
on
me
she
was
in
the
café
at
all
she
declared
i
never
said
she
was
i
said
she
went
through
into
the
corridor
in
the
silence
i
could
feel
cecelia
dropping
into
the
pit
did
you
know
the
man
i
nodded
it
was
henry
mills
chapter
vi
before
i
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
the
incident
over
with
sarah
she
had
seen
cecelia
she
is
perfectly
furious
with
you
she
reported
she
has
heard
from
mills
since
and
she
thinks
it
is
on
your
account
that
you
have
taken
steps
for
breaking
it
off
well
if
she
admits
there
was
something
to
break
off
i
tell
you
sarah
you
are
fretting
yourself
to
no
purpose
the
girl
had
been
there
before
i
afraid
so
sarah
taking
it
so
much
to
heart
was
a
credit
to
her
but
i
was
more
curious
than
commiserating
tell
me
what
is
in
the
mind
of
a
girl
when
she
does
things
like
that
what
does
she
get
out
of
it
excitement
of
course
the
sense
of
being
in
the
stir
and
the
feeling
of
being
protected
she
says
mills
has
been
kind
to
her
it
is
odd
but
she
seems
to
think
it
is
all
right
so
long
as
it
is
going
on
it
is
only
when
it
is
broken
off
she
ca
bear
it
that
is
why
she
is
so
angry
at
you
there
might
be
something
in
that
i
conceded
when
it
is
broken
off
she
is
able
to
realize
how
cheap
and
temporary
it
has
been
while
it
is
going
on
she
can
justify
it
on
the
ground
that
it
is
going
on
forever
that
justify
it
i
suppose
i
did
not
know
how
i
knew
this
but
lately
i
had
discovered
in
myself
capacities
for
understanding
a
great
many
things
of
which
i
had
had
no
experience
what
concerned
me
was
not
cecelia
relation
to
the
incident
whatever
am
i
going
to
do
about
going
there
again
to
pauline
i
mean
you
ca
tell
and
i
ca
go
there
and
not
tell
i
got
to
choose
between
deceiving
pauline
and
condoning
henry
and
i
no
disposition
to
do
either
sarah
thought
it
over
there
is
only
one
thing
you
can
do
you
simply
have
to
go
to
new
york
for
a
great
many
reasons
besides
you
need
tell
me
that
but
how
how
you
know
what
i
offered
what
i
refused
it
is
out
of
the
question
do
speak
of
it
i
suppose
after
this
you
could
ask
the
millses
sarah
i
did
ask
well
all
her
interest
hung
upon
the
interrogation
they
told
me
it
was
good
for
my
spiritual
development
to
suffer
these
things
we
faced
one
another
in
deep
unsmiling
irony
sarah
what
do
you
suppose
it
costs
a
man
for
supper
and
a
private
room
at
reeves
do
she
begged
it
only
a
step
from
that
to
cecelia
yes
i
remember
she
said
that
men
never
afforded
protection
to
women
except
for
value
received
you
must
go
to
new
york
sarah
reiterated
you
must
the
truth
was
i
had
never
told
sarah
exactly
how
poor
i
was
in
the
end
i
let
her
go
away
without
telling
at
the
worst
i
thought
i
might
borrow
from
jerry
who
had
given
up
the
notion
of
going
to
louis
largely
no
doubt
because
i
had
failed
to
back
him
up
in
it
completely
and
then
just
at
the
end
changed
his
mind
and
went
anyway
i
knew
nothing
about
it
until
jerry
wrote
me
from
springfield
for
i
had
grown
shy
of
going
there
where
all
mcdermott
conversation
was
set
like
a
trap
to
catch
me
in
something
that
would
convict
jerry
of
misdemeanour
jerry
asked
me
to
visit
her
in
his
absence
but
i
put
it
off
as
long
as
possible
i
had
to
settle
first
about
going
to
pauline
i
arranged
to
spend
the
afternoon
there
meaning
to
come
away
before
dinner
and
so
by
leaving
henry
to
discover
my
attitude
in
the
circumstance
of
my
having
been
there
without
destroying
his
home
open
the
way
to
my
meeting
him
again
without
embarrassment
to
do
that
i
should
have
left
the
house
before
the
persuasive
smell
of
the
dinner
began
to
creep
up
the
stairs
into
the
warm
softly
lighted
rooms
but
from
the
beginning
of
my
visit
pauline
in
order
that
i
might
not
feel
her
failure
to
put
her
affection
more
cogently
had
wound
me
about
as
with
a
cocoon
of
feminine
devices
from
which
i
had
been
able
to
extricate
myself
earlier
i
am
not
blaming
her
i
am
not
sure
indeed
seeing
how
completely
she
justified
herself
to
henry
mills
by
what
she
had
to
offer
that
i
had
any
right
to
expect
her
to
understand
how
completely
her
playful
and
charming
affectionateness
failed
of
any
possible
use
to
me
but
i
felt
myself
so
far
helpless
in
the
presence
of
it
that
i
stayed
on
until
the
smell
of
the
roast
unloosened
all
the
joints
of
my
resolution
i
had
realized
how
hungry
i
was
until
i
found
myself
at
a
point
where
what
henry
might
think
of
me
became
inconsiderable
before
the
possibility
of
my
being
put
out
of
the
house
before
dinner
was
served
at
the
same
time
i
could
have
wept
at
the
indignity
of
wanting
food
so
much
i
remember
to
this
day
the
wasteful
heaping
of
the
plates
and
my
struggle
with
the
oblique
desire
to
smuggle
portions
of
my
helping
home
to
griff
who
looked
even
more
of
a
stranger
than
i
to
soup
and
fish
and
roast
to
say
nothing
of
dessert
it
was
until
we
had
got
as
far
as
the
salad
that
i
had
leisure
to
observe
henry
grow
rather
red
about
the
gills
as
he
fed
and
speculate
as
to
how
far
it
was
due
to
his
consciousness
that
i
could
bring
down
the
pillars
of
his
home
with
a
word
and
did
intend
to
there
was
nothing
said
during
dinner
about
my
prospects
or
the
stage
in
general
but
when
henry
took
me
out
to
the
car
about
nine
he
cleared
his
throat
several
times
as
though
to
drag
the
subject
up
from
the
pit
of
his
stomach
where
it
must
have
lain
very
uneasily
you
know
he
began
i
been
thinking
about
that
scheme
of
yours
of
going
to
new
york
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
is
something
in
it
i
have
thought
about
it
for
a
long
time
i
told
him
which
was
only
true
in
so
far
as
i
thought
of
it
as
a
possibility
it
would
freshen
you
up
a
whole
lot
henry
insisted
everybody
needs
freshening
i
have
been
taking
a
little
stir
about
myself
so
that
was
the
way
he
wished
me
to
think
of
his
relation
to
cecelia
i
given
it
up
i
insisted
we
were
standing
under
the
swinging
arc
light
in
a
bare
patch
the
wind
had
cleared
of
the
fine
white
february
grit
little
trails
of
it
blew
up
under
foot
and
were
lost
among
the
shadows
i
could
see
henry
purpose
bearing
down
on
me
like
the
far
spark
of
the
approaching
trolley
i
would
do
that
he
advised
it
looks
like
pretty
good
business
to
me
you
have
to
stay
there
some
time
to
learn
the
ropes
and
if
a
few
hundred
dollars
i
given
it
up
i
said
again
the
car
came
alongside
and
henry
helped
me
on
to
it
if
you
were
at
any
time
to
reconsider
it
i
hope
you
will
let
me
know
the
roar
of
the
trolley
cut
him
off
i
knew
i
was
a
fool
not
to
have
accepted
the
sop
to
my
discretion
i
do
know
for
what
the
powers
had
delivered
henry
mills
into
my
hands
if
it
was
to
get
out
of
his
folly
what
his
sober
sense
refused
me
without
doubt
there
are
some
forms
of
integrity
that
persisted
in
cease
to
be
a
virtue
and
become
merely
a
habit
i
could
no
more
have
taken
henry
mills
money
than
i
could
have
gone
to
new
york
without
it
i
went
home
shivering
to
my
fireless
little
room
i
put
on
my
nightgown
over
my
underwear
and
my
dressing
gown
over
that
and
cried
myself
to
sleep
it
was
a
day
or
two
later
that
i
recalled
that
jerry
had
asked
me
to
go
out
and
see
his
wife
and
i
thought
if
i
must
ask
jerry
for
help
it
would
be
no
more
than
prudent
for
me
to
do
so
but
i
was
in
the
least
prepared
as
i
went
up
the
path
from
which
the
snow
of
the
week
before
had
never
been
cleared
to
find
the
house
shut
and
barred
and
no
smoke
issuing
from
it
i
made
my
way
around
to
the
kitchen
door
to
try
to
discover
some
sign
which
would
give
me
a
clue
to
the
length
of
time
it
had
been
deserted
if
not
the
reason
for
it
while
i
was
puzzling
about
among
the
empty
milk
bottles
and
garbage
cans
a
neighbour
woman
put
her
head
out
of
a
nearby
window
and
announced
the
obvious
fact
that
mcdermott
was
in
but
in
her
condition
i
protested
as
though
my
informant
had
been
in
some
way
responsible
for
it
well
if
her
own
mother
is
the
best
place
for
a
woman
in
her
condition
three
days
ago
she
answered
to
my
second
question
mcdermott
mother
lived
in
peoria
and
i
knew
that
when
jerry
left
there
had
been
no
such
understanding
but
as
lingering
there
ankle
deep
in
the
dry
snow
did
seem
to
clear
the
affair
i
undertook
to
rid
myself
of
a
sense
of
blame
by
writing
all
that
i
knew
of
it
to
jerry
within
the
hour
it
was
the
third
day
after
that
he
came
storming
in
on
me
like
a
man
demented
he
had
been
to
peoria
immediately
on
receipt
of
my
letter
and
his
wife
had
refused
to
see
him
it
hardly
seemed
a
time
for
indirection
jerry
what
have
you
done
i
demanded
nothing
not
a
thing
i
waited
there
was
a
fool
skit
in
one
of
the
louis
papers
he
admitted
the
fool
reporter
did
know
i
was
married
it
was
about
you
and
miss
filette
he
nodded
she
had
bought
all
the
louis
papers
he
said
meaning
his
wife
well
that
was
natural
she
wanted
to
read
the
notices
she
was
always
proud
of
you
she
believed
them
too
he
groaned
and
she
talked
her
mother
over
they
would
even
let
me
see
the
children
he
put
his
head
down
on
my
table
and
sobbed
aloud
i
thought
it
might
be
good
for
him
but
by
and
by
my
sensibilities
got
the
better
of
me
would
it
do
any
good
if
i
were
to
write
you
oh
they
think
you
in
it
a
kind
of
general
conspiracy
you
know
you
said
that
that
one
of
the
things
nobody
had
a
right
to
deny
an
artist
was
the
source
of
his
inspiration
jerry
i
said
what
you
asked
me
i
was
properly
indignant
too
when
i
had
been
so
right
on
the
whole
matter
besides
as
jerry
had
written
little
that
winter
except
some
inconsiderable
additions
to
his
play
i
was
rather
of
the
opinion
that
he
measured
the
validity
of
his
passion
by
its
importunity
rather
than
its
effect
on
the
sum
of
his
production
besides
i
told
you
you
would
never
get
your
wife
to
understand
if
she
would
only
be
sensible
he
groaned
she
is
i
reminded
him
you
did
marry
her
to
be
sensible
but
for
her
imagined
capacity
to
go
on
repeating
the
tricks
by
which
miss
filette
keeps
you
complacent
with
yourself
the
trouble
is
marriage
and
having
children
take
that
out
of
a
woman
an
artist
ought
never
to
marry
i
will
always
say
that
i
began
to
wonder
if
that
were
true
if
cecelia
brune
were
not
after
all
the
wiser
we
beat
back
and
forth
on
the
subject
for
the
time
that
i
kept
jerry
with
me
the
evening
of
the
second
day
came
a
telegram
jealousy
tearing
at
the
heart
of
poor
little
mcdermott
had
torn
away
the
young
life
that
nestled
there
jerry
wrote
me
later
that
the
baby
had
breathed
and
died
and
that
his
wife
was
likely
to
be
ill
a
long
time
in
view
of
the
extra
expense
incurred
i
did
feel
that
i
ought
to
ask
him
for
the
loan
i
was
now
so
desperately
in
need
of
it
was
about
this
time
that
griffin
and
i
began
to
avoid
one
another
about
meal
time
i
have
read
how
wild
animals
in
sickness
turn
their
backs
on
one
another
one
must
in
unrelievable
misery
we
dodged
in
and
out
of
our
hall
rooms
like
rabbits
in
a
warren
and
then
suddenly
we
would
meet
and
walk
along
the
streets
together
mostly
at
night
when
the
alternate
flare
of
the
lamps
and
the
darkness
and
the
hurrying
forms
numb
the
sense
like
the
flicker
of
light
on
a
hypnotist
screen
and
we
moved
in
a
strange
incommunicable
world
out
of
which
no
help
reached
us
we
saw
women
go
by
with
the
price
of
our
redemption
flashing
at
their
breasts
or
in
their
hair
we
saw
men
hurried
overburdened
with
work
and
there
was
no
work
for
us
in
our
own
land
we
were
exiled
from
the
community
of
labour
and
we
sighed
for
it
more
than
the
meanest
siberian
prisoner
for
home
and
then
suddenly
communication
seemed
to
be
reëstablished
effie
for
no
reason
sent
me
half
of
the
rent
money
i
do
need
it
here
and
i
think
maybe
i
shall
get
more
out
of
it
by
investing
it
in
you
she
wrote
she
had
always
such
a
way
of
making
the
thing
she
did
seem
the
choice
of
her
soul
i
bought
meat
and
vegetables
and
invited
griff
to
dinner
he
took
me
that
night
to
that
sort
of
dreary
entertainment
known
as
musical
comedy
he
could
often
get
tickets
and
it
was
a
way
of
spending
the
evening
that
saved
fuel
as
we
tramped
back
through
the
chill
trying
for
an
effect
of
jocularity
in
his
voice
so
that
he
might
seem
to
have
made
a
joke
in
case
i
should
like
griff
said
to
me
i
suppose
you
would
go
with
a
musical
comedy
my
dear
griff
i
answered
him
in
the
same
tone
i
go
with
a
flying
trapeze
if
only
it
paid
enough
i
acquainted
with
lowe
the
tenor
i
been
thinking
i
ask
him
we
were
as
shy
of
speaking
of
an
engagement
as
though
it
were
wild
game
to
be
scared
away
by
the
mere
mention
of
it
there
was
no
reason
why
griffin
should
have
succeeded
in
musical
comedy
he
had
a
fairish
voice
and
had
turned
his
gift
as
many
times
as
the
minister
wife
in
higgleston
used
to
turn
her
black
silk
it
was
not
more
than
two
days
or
three
after
that
as
i
was
coming
back
to
my
cold
room
in
the
twilight
i
had
spent
the
day
in
the
public
library
on
account
of
the
heat
and
as
i
was
fumbling
at
the
lock
as
i
had
been
that
first
evening
he
had
spoken
to
me
i
heard
leon
griffin
come
up
the
stair
three
steps
at
a
time
and
i
knew
before
i
heard
it
in
his
voice
that
the
times
had
turned
for
him
i
struck
out
fiercely
against
a
sudden
blankness
that
seemed
to
swim
up
to
the
eyes
and
throat
of
me
he
was
trembling
too
as
he
came
into
the
room
olive
he
cried
olive
i
turned
the
trick
i
going
with
the
that
was
the
wretched
piece
we
had
seen
together
he
had
never
called
me
by
my
name
before
and
i
had
no
mind
to
correct
him
in
the
dusk
he
ran
on
about
his
engagement
they
would
go
on
the
road
presently
and
settle
for
the
summer
in
some
city
i
heard
him
speak
far
from
me
i
was
down
down
in
the
pit
of
the
cold
room
with
the
shabby
furniture
and
the
bleak
light
that
disdained
it
from
the
one
high
window
do
take
off
your
things
i
heard
him
say
i
came
to
get
you
have
a
somewhere
olive
olive
his
quick
sympathy
came
out
and
the
excusing
charm
oh
my
dear
you
crying
griff
you
leaving
me
it
was
as
if
i
had
accused
him
i
sank
down
in
a
chair
i
was
dabbling
at
my
eyes
and
trying
to
get
my
veil
off
with
cold
fingers
not
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
he
came
and
put
his
arms
about
me
and
constrained
me
until
i
leaned
against
his
body
i
knew
what
he
was
what
a
man
of
that
stamp
must
be
feeling
and
thinking
and
knowing
i
permitted
it
i
was
crying
still
i
think
his
hands
came
fumbling
under
my
veil
presently
he
kissed
me
olivia
well
griff
you
know
it
is
for
you
to
say
if
i
shall
leave
you
you
mean
that
you
will
give
up
but
how
can
you
griff
it
is
the
only
thing
that
been
offered
we
were
sitting
still
on
the
low
cot
in
my
room
and
there
was
no
light
but
the
dull
glow
of
the
stove
and
the
last
trace
of
the
day
that
came
in
at
the
window
we
had
not
been
out
to
dinner
yet
and
griffin
arm
was
around
me
i
could
feel
it
slack
a
little
now
as
if
he
definitely
forebore
to
constrain
me
i
mean
lowe
could
get
you
a
place
in
the
chorus
but
griff
i
ca
sing
you
can
sing
enough
for
that
and
lowe
would
get
you
the
place
if
if
you
belonged
to
me
i
knew
exactly
what
this
implied
but
no
start
responded
to
it
the
nerve
of
propriety
was
ached
out
of
course
i
know
i
not
in
your
class
griff
was
going
on
i
would
do
such
a
thing
as
ask
you
to
marry
me
but
i
awfully
fond
of
you
and
you
up
against
it
yes
griff
i
up
against
it
your
fine
friends
what
would
they
do
for
you
nothing
whatever
well
then
you
need
go
under
your
own
name
and
this
is
a
chance
you
could
live
and
maybe
get
somewhere
lowe
told
me
he
meant
to
strike
for
broadway
you
are
insulted
are
you
no
i
not
insulted
curiously
that
was
true
i
was
drunk
and
shaking
inside
of
me
i
seemed
to
be
poised
upon
the
dizzying
edge
but
i
was
neither
angry
nor
insulted
and
i
never
come
back
on
you
if
you
got
your
chance
for
yourself
honest
to
god
olive
i
had
my
lesson
at
that
you
believe
me
you
i
believed
him
i
had
any
sense
whatever
of
the
moral
values
of
the
situation
it
was
too
desperate
for
that
i
guess
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
a
bad
sort
bad
with
women
after
i
knew
that
my
that
miss
dean
did
want
me
i
did
care
what
became
of
me
there
was
a
woman
in
the
company
she
liked
me
and
i
thought
it
would
give
laura
a
chance
that
was
what
the
divorce
was
about
i
thought
i
could
make
it
up
to
the
other
woman
by
marrying
her
but
that
did
work
either
he
was
silent
a
while
forgetting
perhaps
that
he
had
begun
to
explain
himself
to
me
there
a
way
you
got
to
like
a
person
to
live
with
them
and
anyway
i
not
asking
you
to
marry
me
he
got
as
much
satisfaction
out
of
that
as
if
it
were
a
superior
abnegation
you
got
to
decide
right
away
griffin
urged
me
i
must
have
a
day
to
think
i
insisted
not
because
i
hoped
that
anything
would
interfere
between
me
and
disaster
but
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
throw
it
up
to
the
powers
that
i
had
given
them
an
opportunity
i
knew
what
he
was
i
had
always
known
when
he
put
his
cheek
against
mine
to
kiss
me
i
had
felt
the
marks
there
of
waste
and
looseness
just
as
i
felt
now
that
native
trick
he
had
for
extenuation
for
putting
himself
on
the
pathetic
the
excusing
side
of
things
but
i
did
not
shrink
from
him
i
suppose
it
was
because
just
then
he
was
a
symbol
of
the
protection
which
i
had
so
signally
gone
without
the
need
of
trusting
is
stronger
in
women
than
experience
nothing
saved
me
but
the
persistent
monitor
of
my
art
here
when
all
else
was
numbed
by
loneliness
and
hunger
and
unsuccess
it
waked
and
warned
me
i
had
not
drawn
back
from
griffin
nor
the
relation
he
proposed
to
me
but
i
could
stand
for
i
think
just
at
first
though
i
made
myself
believe
i
was
considering
it
i
went
out
to
see
pauline
the
next
afternoon
not
that
i
expected
anything
from
her
it
was
merely
that
she
represented
all
that
stood
opposed
to
what
i
was
being
coerced
into
and
i
meant
to
give
it
a
chance
i
am
thinking
of
going
with
i
told
her
oh
but
my
dear
surely
not
with
that
i
get
eighteen
dollars
a
week
and
my
expenses
well
of
course
if
you
want
to
sell
yourself
just
for
a
salary
pauline
attitude
could
not
have
been
improved
on
if
she
had
known
all
that
the
engagement
implied
but
it
was
in
her
to
be
ungracious
for
long
i
suppose
you
get
experience
i
get
my
board
and
clothes
out
of
it
i
told
her
bluntly
and
whether
i
like
it
or
not
it
is
the
only
thing
offered
and
you
are
just
taking
it
on
trust
i
suppose
that
is
the
right
way
you
can
never
tell
how
things
will
be
brought
about
i
do
know
how
much
of
this
was
honest
and
how
much
derived
from
the
capacity
for
which
grows
on
women
whose
sole
business
in
life
is
getting
on
with
a
man
at
any
rate
having
shaken
my
situation
around
to
the
shape
of
a
moral
attitude
as
a
robin
does
a
worm
nothing
would
have
prevented
her
from
swallowing
it
whole
faint
as
i
was
i
refused
her
invitation
to
dinner
with
what
i
had
in
mind
to
do
i
did
care
to
meet
henry
mills
again
i
was
fiercer
in
my
detestation
of
him
and
cecelia
than
i
had
been
before
i
had
thought
of
being
in
the
same
case
myself
i
resented
them
as
a
ribald
commentary
on
my
necessity
as
i
rode
home
on
the
car
all
my
outer
self
was
in
a
tumult
dazed
and
buzzing
like
a
hive
i
was
dimly
aware
of
moving
sitting
upright
of
paying
my
fare
and
of
great
staring
red
posters
that
flashed
upon
me
from
the
billboards
i
remember
that
it
occurred
to
me
several
times
that
if
i
could
only
understand
what
i
read
on
them
it
might
be
greatly
to
my
profit
somewhere
deep
under
my
confusion
i
was
aware
of
being
plucked
by
the
fringes
of
my
consciousness
something
was
trying
to
get
through
to
me
i
refused
to
see
griffin
at
all
that
evening
and
got
into
bed
early
staring
into
the
dark
and
seeing
nothing
but
fragments
of
red
letters
that
seemed
about
to
shape
themselves
into
the
saving
word
and
then
dissolved
and
left
me
blank
i
tried
to
pray
and
realized
that
i
had
no
connecting
wires
over
which
help
might
come
belief
in
the
god
i
had
been
brought
up
to
had
been
beaten
out
of
me
at
higgleston
very
largely
by
the
conviction
of
those
who
professed
to
know
him
best
that
he
could
in
any
case
be
the
god
of
my
gift
and
i
had
been
thinking
since
then
of
the
something
without
us
to
which
i
acted
as
deity
now
it
occurred
to
me
lying
there
in
the
dark
that
if
the
god
of
the
church
had
cast
me
off
there
must
still
be
something
which
artists
everywhere
prayed
to
a
distributer
of
gifts
who
might
be
concerned
about
the
conduct
of
his
worshippers
i
reached
out
for
him
and
i
did
not
know
his
name
i
must
pray
though
i
must
pray
to
something
which
stood
for
help
slowly
as
i
cast
back
in
my
mind
to
find
the
name
for
it
i
remembered
eversley
eversley
was
everything
which
any
player
might
wish
to
be
and
eversley
had
been
kind
i
would
pray
to
eversley
all
at
once
there
flashed
across
the
blank
of
my
mind
his
name
in
letters
of
red
that
was
it
that
was
the
name
on
the
billboards
eversley
was
in
town
i
recalled
that
griff
had
spoken
of
it
i
had
been
able
to
spare
a
penny
for
a
paper
for
a
long
time
or
i
should
have
known
it
i
would
see
eversley
i
got
up
and
groped
around
in
the
cupboard
for
a
piece
of
dry
bread
and
ate
it
then
i
went
back
to
bed
and
dropped
asleep
suddenly
with
the
release
of
tension
i
would
see
eversley
griffin
failed
to
understand
my
change
of
mood
in
the
morning
you
are
afraid
that
i
shall
try
to
hold
you
no
i
not
afraid
or
that
anybody
will
find
it
out
i
should
care
if
they
did
i
told
him
i
going
to
see
eversley
i
suppose
it
fair
to
tell
you
you
be
the
last
resort
griff
i
be
the
foundation
of
your
fortune
if
eversley
will
let
me
but
he
wo
i
think
there
was
regret
in
his
voice
but
it
was
never
in
anything
he
said
to
me
i
know
you
not
mean
griff
that
why
i
told
you
oh
i
tell
you
too
i
was
mean
once
i
did
mean
to
be
but
it
turned
out
that
way
he
was
on
the
point
of
admitting
something
to
me
that
i
felt
if
i
was
to
depend
upon
him
i
should
hear
i
got
out
as
early
as
possible
and
walked
until
i
found
a
billboard
eversley
was
at
the
playhouse
he
had
been
playing
here
for
three
days
i
walked
past
it
several
times
considering
the
possibility
of
getting
his
address
from
the
stage
doorman
though
i
knew
i
could
it
was
clear
and
bright
few
people
moved
in
the
street
i
walked
between
the
alleyways
and
a
row
of
waiting
for
the
belated
carts
of
the
cleaners
eversley
eversley
i
called
over
and
over
as
if
it
had
been
a
charm
suddenly
in
the
still
cold
brightness
a
torn
fragment
of
newspaper
flapped
in
the
it
lifted
and
made
a
clumsy
flight
like
a
bird
and
dropped
beside
me
its
one
torn
wing
flapped
gently
as
i
passed
it
and
showed
me
part
of
a
pictured
face
i
said
to
myself
that
i
was
in
a
pretty
state
when
even
a
torn
face
in
a
paper
looked
like
eversley
i
had
gone
on
three
steps
and
suddenly
i
stopped
it
was
eversley
of
course
his
picture
would
be
in
the
papers
i
went
back
and
lifted
the
printed
scrap
it
was
part
of
an
interview
with
the
great
tragedian
three
days
old
and
it
told
me
the
address
of
his
hotel
it
was
nearly
eleven
when
i
arrived
there
the
foyer
was
crowded
with
people
among
whom
i
fancied
i
recognized
several
of
my
profession
they
had
the
same
desperate
air
that
i
knew
must
stand
out
on
me
i
thought
the
clerk
recognized
it
eversley
is
not
in
this
morning
i
was
told
they
pretended
too
not
to
know
when
he
would
be
in
i
understood
that
this
meant
that
he
was
in
but
probably
asleep
or
breakfasting
i
found
a
chair
close
to
one
of
the
elevators
and
waited
the
room
was
warm
and
i
was
faint
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
sat
there
i
must
have
been
almost
unconscious
suddenly
i
snapped
alert
there
was
eversley
and
two
or
three
others
stepping
into
the
elevator
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
i
was
too
late
of
course
to
catch
them
eversley
apartments
i
said
to
the
elevator
boy
first
turn
to
the
left
he
told
me
when
he
had
let
me
out
on
the
fourth
floor
i
was
afraid
to
ask
the
number
of
the
room
lest
he
should
suspect
me
of
intruding
there
were
five
or
six
doors
down
the
left
corridor
i
knocked
at
one
at
a
hazard
and
was
rejected
by
a
large
woman
in
deshabille
i
was
discouraged
somehow
the
prospect
of
knocking
at
every
one
of
those
doors
and
inquiring
for
eversley
daunted
me
i
was
dividing
between
my
dread
of
that
and
a
still
greater
dread
if
i
should
be
found
loitering
too
long
in
the
corridor
of
being
taken
for
a
suspicious
person
in
a
few
moments
however
a
woman
came
out
of
one
of
the
doors
farthest
down
and
moved
toward
me
i
thought
it
was
she
i
had
seen
getting
into
the
elevator
with
eversley
she
had
the
gracious
air
of
women
who
know
themselves
relied
upon
she
stopped
hypnotized
by
my
evident
wish
to
speak
to
her
mrs
eversley
she
acknowledged
it
i
am
trying
to
find
your
husband
i
have
his
permission
i
interpolated
as
i
saw
her
pleasant
open
countenance
close
upon
me
i
learned
afterward
how
much
of
her
life
went
to
saving
him
the
strain
of
publicity
and
i
did
not
blame
her
my
husband
never
sees
visitors
in
the
morning
if
you
would
show
him
this
card
i
begged
perhaps
he
would
make
an
appointment
she
recognized
the
writing
on
the
card
and
i
saw
her
relenting
eversley
it
proved
would
see
me
he
pretended
kindly
to
have
recognized
me
at
once
but
he
did
ask
after
the
hardings
he
saw
that
it
was
the
last
lap
with
me
my
dear
miss
lattimore
sit
here
now
tell
me
so
i
concluded
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
i
thought
you
could
tell
me
if
it
is
all
gone
if
i
am
never
to
have
it
back
again
i
can
go
with
a
musical
comedy
i
had
told
him
of
course
what
the
conditions
were
of
my
having
even
that
but
if
you
think
it
could
be
brought
back
again
i
could
hardly
formulate
a
hope
beyond
that
never
in
the
old
way
he
answered
promptly
would
wish
that
what
you
did
at
twenty
you
must
not
wish
to
do
at
thirty
for
then
there
is
no
growth
what
do
you
really
feel
about
it
i
feel
i
said
as
if
i
could
do
something
something
pressing
to
be
done
but
somehow
different
so
different
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
describe
it
to
anybody
nor
to
get
them
to
believe
in
it
and
so
you
have
begun
to
doubt
it
yourself
i
shall
believe
you
i
said
he
sat
still
after
that
for
a
while
staring
into
the
open
fire
and
rubbing
his
fine
expressive
hands
together
in
a
meditative
way
it
was
good
to
me
to
see
him
just
touched
mellowly
with
age
the
delicate
carving
in
his
face
of
nobility
and
gentleness
there
were
men
like
that
then
men
who
made
by
their
mere
being
something
more
than
a
shibboleth
of
the
traditional
dependability
he
seemed
to
be
far
away
from
me
groping
around
the
root
of
truth
in
respect
to
that
gift
with
which
he
was
so
richly
endowed
he
rose
presently
and
took
a
which
lay
face
downward
on
the
table
could
you
do
a
bit
of
this
with
me
he
suggested
it
will
help
me
get
my
lines
the
play
was
magda
new
then
on
the
american
stage
eversley
was
getting
up
the
part
of
colonel
schwartz
he
explained
the
story
to
me
a
little
and
i
began
reading
and
prompting
him
presently
i
felt
the
familiar
click
of
myself
sliding
into
the
part
all
my
winter
in
chicago
rose
up
in
the
part
of
to
protest
against
the
judgment
of
taylorville
i
knew
better
too
than
to
attempt
any
sort
of
staginess
with
eversley
i
said
the
words
trying
to
understand
them
and
let
the
part
have
its
way
with
me
it
was
not
until
we
had
laid
down
the
book
that
i
remembered
i
was
still
waiting
judgment
and
did
not
feel
to
want
it
i
wo
take
up
any
more
of
your
time
i
suggested
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
i
got
up
to
go
after
all
what
was
there
that
eversley
could
do
for
me
well
he
said
and
is
it
to
be
musical
comedy
no
i
told
him
no
it
may
be
starvation
or
the
lake
but
i
not
let
myself
down
like
that
was
that
why
you
asked
me
to
do
the
part
i
said
after
a
while
in
which
he
had
sat
gazing
into
the
fire
without
taking
any
note
of
my
standing
sit
down
he
said
have
you
ever
heard
of
polatkin
i
shook
my
head
and
sat
provisionally
on
the
edge
of
my
chair
polatkin
is
a
speculator
he
speculates
in
ability
i
think
on
the
whole
the
best
thing
i
can
do
for
you
is
to
introduce
you
to
polatkin
eversley
thought
of
morris
polatkin
because
he
had
met
him
the
day
before
in
chicago
before
i
left
the
hotel
it
was
arranged
that
i
was
to
see
him
the
next
day
and
if
he
liked
me
by
the
tone
in
which
mark
eversley
spoke
of
him
i
knew
that
was
foregone
he
would
take
me
on
to
new
york
with
him
and
put
my
gift
on
a
paying
basis
so
suddenly
had
the
release
from
strain
come
that
i
found
myself
toppling
over
my
own
resistance
i
went
out
in
the
street
and
walked
about
until
reminded
by
the
gnawing
in
my
stomach
that
i
had
had
nothing
but
the
brewing
of
my
coffee
grounds
for
breakfast
i
turned
into
the
first
attractive
café
and
paid
out
almost
my
last
cent
for
a
comforting
luncheon
it
would
have
gone
farther
if
i
had
bought
food
and
cooked
it
at
home
but
i
was
past
that
i
had
pinched
and
endured
to
the
last
pitch
i
could
no
more
and
besides
the
assurance
of
mark
eversley
which
as
yet
i
could
scarcely
believe
in
there
had
come
a
strange
new
courage
upon
me
for
as
i
had
suffered
and
struggled
with
suddenly
from
some
high
unknowable
source
power
descended
i
had
felt
it
fluttering
low
like
a
dove
hovering
over
me
it
had
perched
on
my
spirit
i
could
feel
it
there
now
brooding
about
me
with
singing
noises
it
had
come
back
i
rushed
to
meet
it
as
to
a
lover
as
i
walked
back
to
my
lodging
a
flood
of
hopes
half
shapes
of
conquests
and
surmises
bore
me
like
a
widening
flood
apart
from
all
that
the
last
few
months
stood
for
suddenly
at
the
door
i
realized
how
far
it
had
carried
me
from
griffin
the
figure
of
him
was
faint
in
my
mind
as
one
seen
from
the
farther
shore
i
considered
a
little
and
then
i
wrote
him
a
note
and
slipped
it
under
the
door
i
went
out
again
and
walked
aimlessly
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
when
it
was
dark
i
stole
softly
up
to
my
room
again
but
he
heard
me
he
came
knocking
almost
immediately
full
of
the
appearance
of
rejoicing
but
even
the
dusk
did
conceal
from
me
that
embarrassment
was
on
him
he
looked
checked
and
confounded
as
when
he
had
told
me
about
his
relation
to
miss
dean
like
a
man
caught
in
an
unwarrantable
assumption
whatever
dean
had
done
to
him
it
had
broken
the
back
of
his
egotism
completely
he
knew
well
enough
he
had
no
business
with
a
woman
like
me
a
friend
of
mark
eversley
and
he
was
ashamed
to
have
been
caught
thinking
he
had
he
sidled
and
fluttered
for
an
interval
making
up
his
mind
to
a
resumption
of
affectionateness
and
finally
making
it
up
that
he
could
and
remembering
an
engagement
somewhere
for
the
evening
it
was
about
eleven
of
the
next
day
that
i
had
a
note
from
eversley
to
come
to
his
rooms
to
meet
polatkin
i
went
in
a
kind
of
haze
of
excitement
numb
as
to
my
feet
and
moving
about
by
reflexes
merely
and
with
a
vague
doubt
as
each
new
point
of
the
way
presented
itself
the
car
i
took
the
hotel
stair
the
length
of
the
corridor
if
i
should
be
equal
to
any
one
of
them
so
far
was
my
consciousness
removed
from
the
means
of
communication
eversley
shook
hands
with
me
out
of
a
cloud
moving
in
an
orbit
miles
outside
of
my
own
and
when
he
left
me
saying
that
polatkin
would
come
up
the
next
moment
it
was
as
if
he
had
withdrawn
into
the
vastness
of
outer
space
in
the
interval
before
i
heard
polatkin
knock
i
rehearsed
a
great
many
ways
of
meeting
him
none
of
which
were
from
the
right
cue
i
do
not
know
why
i
had
been
prepared
by
the
name
for
his
being
a
jew
nor
for
the
sudden
shifting
of
the
ground
of
our
meeting
which
that
fact
made
for
me
so
far
as
i
had
thought
of
him
at
all
it
was
in
a
kind
of
nebulosity
of
the
high
disinterestedness
that
was
responsible
for
mark
eversley
interest
in
me
it
had
been
his
generous
succour
all
of
a
piece
of
that
traditional
protectiveness
the
expectation
of
which
is
so
drilled
into
women
that
it
rose
promptly
in
advance
of
any
occasion
for
it
the
mere
supposition
that
he
was
to
provide
for
me
had
tinged
my
mind
unaware
with
the
natural
response
of
a
docility
made
ridiculous
by
the
figure
of
polatkin
edging
himself
in
through
a
door
that
an
arrangement
of
furniture
made
impossible
completely
to
open
his
height
did
not
bring
him
above
the
level
of
my
eyes
and
as
much
of
him
as
was
visible
above
his
furred
coat
was
chiefly
nose
and
pallid
forehead
disdained
by
tight
black
curly
hair
and
extraordinarily
black
eyes
which
seemed
to
have
retreated
under
the
brows
for
the
purpose
of
taking
council
with
the
intelligence
that
informed
them
i
had
put
on
my
best
to
meet
him
and
though
my
husband
had
been
dead
more
than
two
years
my
best
was
still
tinged
with
widowhood
for
the
chief
reason
that
once
having
got
into
black
i
had
not
been
able
to
afford
to
put
it
off
for
anything
more
suitable
i
had
put
a
good
deal
of
white
about
the
neck
trying
for
an
effect
which
i
knew
as
eyes
travelled
over
me
had
been
feminine
rather
than
professional
now
as
i
realized
how
i
had
unconsciously
responded
to
the
suggestion
of
preciousness
in
the
fact
of
his
coming
to
take
care
of
me
i
felt
myself
grow
from
head
to
foot
one
deep
suffusing
red
it
comes
out
for
me
in
retrospect
how
near
i
was
to
the
situation
which
had
intrigued
cecelia
brune
and
her
kind
put
at
disadvantage
not
by
a
monetary
obligation
so
much
as
by
the
inevitable
feminine
reaction
toward
the
source
of
care
and
protection
at
the
time
however
i
was
concerned
to
keep
the
stodgy
little
jew
who
stood
hat
in
hand
taking
stock
of
me
from
discovering
that
i
had
come
to
this
meeting
with
a
degree
of
personal
expectation
which
i
should
have
resented
in
him
i
hoped
indeed
that
my
blush
might
pass
with
him
for
a
denial
of
the
very
thing
it
confessed
or
at
least
for
mere
shyness
and
gaucherie
i
was
helped
from
my
confusion
by
the
realization
that
polatkin
was
not
so
much
looking
at
me
or
speaking
to
me
as
projecting
me
into
the
future
and
gauging
me
against
a
background
of
his
own
creation
i
was
standing
still
after
we
had
got
through
some
perfunctory
civilities
for
i
thought
he
would
want
me
to
act
for
him
but
i
found
afterward
that
he
had
trusted
eversley
for
my
capacity
and
i
had
a
feeling
of
being
able
to
meet
the
situation
better
on
my
feet
i
caught
him
looking
at
me
with
an
irritating
impersonality
jalowaski
shall
make
your
corsets
he
affirmed
he
makes
for
eames
and
gadski
a
little
more
off
there
a
little
longer
here
so
he
did
not
touch
me
he
was
not
even
within
touching
distance
but
he
followed
the
outline
of
my
figure
with
his
thumb
flourishing
out
the
alterations
which
made
it
more
to
his
mind
jalowaski
would
fix
you
so
you
would
believe
it
was
you
he
concluded
he
appeared
so
well
satisfied
with
his
inspection
that
he
expanded
graciously
and
there
is
one
thing
you
have
which
there
is
lots
of
actresses
would
give
half
they
got
for
it
you
have
got
imagination
in
the
way
you
dress
your
hair
it
is
a
wonder
how
some
of
them
can
act
and
yet
ai
got
no
imagination
at
all
about
the
way
they
look
only
so
it
is
stylish
for
an
actress
it
is
all
right
for
her
to
look
stylish
on
the
street
but
there
are
times
when
she
has
to
look
otherways
on
the
stage
me
i
slid
somehow
into
a
chair
i
do
know
exactly
what
i
expected
but
it
certainly
had
been
this
appraisement
which
i
had
the
sense
to
see
was
favourable
and
yet
resented
the
first
thing
we
will
see
to
yet
is
some
clothes
for
you
will
excuse
me
miss
lattimore
but
what
you
are
wearing
do
show
you
off
at
all
you
do
need
to
wear
black
of
course
i
know
you
are
a
widow
eversley
was
telling
me
but
there
are
some
actresses
what
make
out
like
they
was
because
they
think
it
becomes
them
y
understand
but
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
wear
it
for
eversley
is
telling
me
that
your
husband
is
dead
more
than
two
years
already
he
had
loosened
his
coat
to
display
an
appropriate
amount
of
gold
fob
dependent
over
a
small
balloon
in
the
process
of
being
inflated
now
from
somewhere
in
his
inner
recess
he
produced
a
folded
paper
it
is
better
we
have
a
contract
from
the
start
though
of
course
it
is
all
right
if
eversley
recommends
you
but
it
is
better
we
have
misunderstandings
he
spread
the
paper
out
and
weighted
it
with
one
of
his
pudgy
hands
so
you
are
going
to
take
me
you
have
seen
me
act
yet
eversley
has
well
if
you
want
to
take
his
judgment
but
he
has
told
me
anything
about
yet
what
do
you
want
of
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
me
if
eversley
had
told
him
how
desperate
my
situation
was
it
was
a
good
move
to
try
to
hold
out
against
him
now
it
might
have
given
him
the
idea
that
i
was
ungrateful
but
i
could
stand
for
being
handed
about
this
way
like
a
female
chattel
that
eversley
had
told
him
i
saw
by
the
expression
of
astonishment
on
his
face
which
slowly
changed
to
one
of
amusement
i
going
to
save
you
from
starving
to
death
he
began
and
then
as
the
sense
of
my
courage
in
the
face
of
such
an
alternative
grew
upon
him
i
going
to
make
you
one
of
the
leading
tragic
actresses
of
america
and
what
am
i
to
do
whatever
i
tell
you
eversley
thinks
you
could
study
a
while
with
delamater
she
is
wonderful
wonderful
he
described
with
his
arms
a
circle
scarcely
larger
than
the
arc
of
his
cherubic
contour
to
show
how
wonderful
she
was
i
should
like
some
dancing
lessons
too
i
submitted
do
you
dance
ah
no
it
is
too
much
to
expect
but
if
i
could
find
me
a
dancer
miss
lattimore
a
born
dancer
he
brought
his
arms
into
play
again
to
describe
a
felicity
which
transcended
expression
but
they
are
not
so
easy
to
find
he
sighed
audibly
we
must
do
what
we
can
already
eversley
told
me
afterward
that
polatkin
had
the
soul
of
an
actor
but
the
only
part
which
he
had
ever
been
able
to
play
without
being
ridiculous
was
fagin
and
now
he
was
too
fat
even
for
that
so
that
he
took
it
out
vicariously
in
the
success
of
those
whose
opportunity
he
made
it
was
the
dream
of
his
life
to
find
a
real
genius
a
dancer
or
a
prima
donna
i
believe
i
was
the
nearest
he
ever
came
to
it
and
i
owe
it
to
him
to
say
that
i
could
have
arrived
at
more
than
the
faintest
approach
to
it
without
him
it
was
that
contract
i
signed
with
him
there
in
eversley
room
which
brought
him
in
the
end
about
three
hundred
per
cent
on
the
money
he
advanced
me
but
i
never
begrudged
it
he
gave
me
a
check
then
and
there
and
an
address
of
a
hotel
in
new
york
where
i
was
to
meet
him
within
five
days
he
looked
me
well
over
as
he
shook
hands
with
me
you
would
be
better
if
you
would
weigh
about
ten
pounds
more
he
assured
me
and
i
was
mixed
between
resentment
at
his
personality
and
thankfulness
to
have
even
that
sort
of
interest
taken
in
me
i
had
lunch
with
and
eversley
afterward
there
was
not
time
for
half
the
things
i
wished
to
hear
from
him
but
this
sticks
in
my
memory
i
had
put
it
to
him
that
the
meagreness
of
my
personal
experiences
had
so
far
tended
to
the
skimping
of
my
art
there
no
question
as
to
that
he
told
me
but
it
is
nothing
compared
to
the
effect
that
your
art
will
have
on
your
experience
a
mistake
to
let
it
set
up
in
you
an
appetite
for
particular
kinds
of
it
there
the
experience
of
having
done
without
experience
you
can
put
that
into
your
acting
as
well
as
the
other
and
you
find
it
is
often
the
most
valuable
i
was
later
to
find
the
worth
of
that
but
like
most
advice
it
only
proved
itself
in
the
event
of
my
not
taking
it
there
was
not
much
to
be
done
about
my
leaving
chicago
i
had
rooted
there
shallowly
i
went
out
that
afternoon
to
tell
pauline
for
i
wished
to
avoid
henry
it
seemed
a
great
step
my
going
away
there
was
a
kind
of
finality
about
it
the
casual
character
of
my
relation
to
the
stage
had
disappeared
i
was
about
to
be
married
to
it
pauline
cried
a
little
in
spite
of
there
being
so
much
in
my
life
that
i
could
tell
her
i
remembered
how
long
we
had
been
friends
and
that
we
were
very
fond
of
one
another
she
could
of
course
quite
abandon
her
favourite
moral
attitude
you
have
a
great
work
olivia
a
great
responsibility
you
must
remember
that
you
are
the
trustee
of
a
rare
gift
i
take
as
good
care
of
it
i
assured
her
as
those
who
sent
it
take
of
me
at
the
time
i
believe
i
felt
that
the
powers
taken
notice
of
me
at
last
i
got
away
as
soon
as
possible
it
seemed
kinder
to
griffin
we
had
been
divided
as
by
a
sword
he
knew
now
there
was
nothing
between
us
and
he
was
abashed
at
the
memory
of
having
touched
me
all
that
time
we
had
lurked
behind
the
pressure
of
packing
and
settling
my
affairs
we
never
came
out
squarely
and
faced
one
another
i
think
some
latent
manhood
that
had
risen
to
my
need
of
him
slunk
back
with
the
certainty
that
i
could
do
very
well
without
him
you
be
sure
and
hunt
me
up
if
you
come
to
new
york
i
urged
i
was
going
to
be
accused
of
disloyalty
because
of
the
rise
in
my
fortunes
he
shook
his
head
you
be
up
among
the
nobs
then
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
wistfully
you
remember
that
i
said
i
would
try
to
hold
you
i
let
him
get
what
comfort
he
could
out
of
the
generosity
he
imagined
in
himself
at
that
seen
against
the
shining
background
which
money
had
made
for
me
he
looked
almost
weazened
i
said
with
another
handshake
and
i
set
my
face
steadily
toward
new
york
book
iv
chapter
i
the
third
season
in
new
york
found
me
in
a
very
gratifying
situation
i
had
made
a
public
for
myself
and
friends
not
only
new
friends
but
old
ones
drawn
there
by
good
fortune
of
their
own
i
had
worked
out
my
obligation
to
polatkin
though
i
was
still
on
such
terms
with
him
as
allowed
him
to
give
me
a
good
deal
of
advice
and
for
me
to
call
him
poly
in
his
more
human
moments
i
used
even
to
go
out
to
his
house
at
one
hundred
and
street
to
spend
an
hour
with
polatkin
and
the
several
little
replicas
of
himself
of
whom
in
spite
of
their
tendency
to
run
mostly
to
nose
and
forehead
he
was
exceedingly
proud
the
help
he
had
afforded
me
had
uncovered
new
layers
of
capacity
to
fill
out
satisfyingly
the
opportunities
he
created
i
was
a
successful
actress
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
i
was
a
success
i
would
have
been
able
to
prove
it
by
the
figure
of
my
salary
and
often
when
the
house
rocked
with
applause
and
i
was
called
time
after
time
before
the
curtain
i
would
question
the
high
void
i
would
look
and
ache
and
cry
out
inwardly
for
what
well
i
suppose
i
knew
pretty
well
what
i
was
looking
for
by
the
end
of
that
year
though
it
was
a
thing
i
could
say
much
about
even
to
sarah
sarah
and
i
had
a
flat
together
on
street
the
second
winter
we
had
played
together
in
a
comedy
jerry
had
written
for
us
with
so
much
success
that
it
was
impossible
that
we
should
remain
together
long
to
have
kept
together
two
players
of
such
distinguished
and
equal
quality
would
have
been
to
miss
the
lustre
of
achievement
which
they
might
each
shed
on
a
lesser
group
wholly
without
any
other
excuse
for
coherence
our
managers
too
contrived
to
get
us
not
a
little
advertisement
out
of
the
circumstance
of
our
being
friends
and
undivided
by
success
there
was
however
one
fact
known
to
us
both
though
without
any
conscious
communication
which
we
would
not
for
worlds
have
made
known
to
an
unsuspecting
public
and
that
was
that
while
i
was
still
on
the
hither
side
of
my
full
power
sarah
had
come
to
the
level
of
hers
sarah
was
always
wonderful
in
what
i
call
static
parts
parts
all
of
one
mood
and
consistency
she
was
notable
as
portia
as
hermione
absolute
perhaps
the
greatest
favourite
with
her
public
was
galatea
which
besides
being
well
within
the
average
taste
allowed
the
greatest
display
of
her
bodily
perfection
yet
with
all
this
sarah
knew
that
she
was
nearing
the
end
of
her
contribution
knew
it
perhaps
with
that
prescience
of
the
gift
itself
folding
up
its
wings
for
withdrawal
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
she
abandoned
her
talent
because
she
had
no
more
use
for
it
or
if
it
left
her
because
its
time
was
served
i
think
we
arrived
at
this
certainty
about
our
powers
night
by
night
that
year
as
we
came
together
after
the
performance
sarah
as
though
she
had
come
back
from
a
full
meal
with
a
sense
of
things
accomplished
but
i
i
came
hungry
sometimes
it
was
merely
with
the
feeling
of
interrupted
capacity
as
when
one
has
left
off
in
the
middle
of
the
course
when
i
would
continue
acting
in
my
room
going
over
my
part
recalling
others
trying
experiments
with
them
pouring
myself
out
until
sarah
poor
dear
fell
asleep
in
the
midst
of
her
effort
to
be
interested
other
times
i
would
rage
up
and
down
all
my
soul
baffled
and
aching
with
incompletion
i
do
not
mean
to
say
i
had
taken
a
healthy
satisfaction
in
what
had
come
to
me
the
knowledge
of
being
worth
while
of
contributing
something
not
less
in
sheer
bodily
leisure
beautiful
clothes
conscious
harmony
with
my
background
i
had
more
feeling
of
home
for
that
little
flat
of
ours
than
i
had
ever
known
in
my
house
or
my
husband
for
the
plain
reason
that
its
lines
and
colours
and
adjustments
were
in
tune
with
my
temperament
as
nothing
i
had
had
before
had
been
it
was
until
i
had
the
means
to
give
my
personal
preference
full
scope
that
i
discovered
how
much
of
gracelessness
in
myself
had
been
but
the
unconscious
reaction
to
inharmonies
of
colour
and
line
i
had
developed
in
response
to
my
environment
the
quality
called
charm
and
i
was
a
successful
actress
i
have
to
go
back
to
that
to
get
anything
like
the
effect
of
solidity
which
my
world
took
on
with
that
certainty
i
was
developing
too
as
my
critics
allowed
and
gave
promise
of
steady
growth
i
was
well
paid
and
well
friended
i
do
mean
to
say
either
that
i
did
not
get
something
out
of
being
a
part
of
the
dramatic
movement
of
my
time
knowing
and
known
of
the
best
it
afforded
i
was
integrally
a
part
of
that
crowd
so
envied
of
the
street
i
knew
a
great
many
notables
by
their
first
names
and
all
the
time
i
wanted
something
at
last
i
knew
what
i
wanted
it
will
come
sarah
had
faith
for
me
everything
comes
if
it
is
called
hard
enough
but
you
must
allow
yourself
to
be
persuaded
by
your
wanting
it
so
much
to
take
any
sort
of
substitute
that
was
on
an
occasion
when
my
taylorville
training
had
revolted
against
some
of
the
things
that
though
they
passed
current
in
my
world
wore
to
me
the
indelible
stamp
of
cheapness
every
now
and
then
some
aspect
of
it
struck
across
my
hereditary
prejudices
and
gave
me
a
feeling
of
isolation
of
separateness
which
drove
me
back
in
time
to
condone
the
offences
which
set
me
apart
in
an
inviolable
loneliness
it
was
something
my
manager
had
said
in
my
hearing
about
liking
his
leading
woman
to
have
a
liaison
with
the
leading
man
because
it
kept
her
limbered
up
i
might
as
well
i
said
to
sarah
i
could
have
my
leading
man
any
minute
this
was
true
though
it
was
by
no
means
the
inevitable
situation
and
sarah
in
acknowledging
it
had
not
spared
to
point
out
to
me
the
probable
outcome
of
such
a
relation
this
is
the
way
we
all
end
is
it
i
demanded
why
should
i
go
looking
for
an
exceptional
experience
we
both
of
us
know
that
i
shall
never
come
to
my
full
power
without
passion
and
i
have
a
notion
that
with
experiences
as
with
everything
else
we
have
to
eat
as
we
are
helped
and
my
leading
man
is
the
only
thing
on
the
plate
and
then
sarah
had
replied
to
me
with
the
advice
i
set
down
a
moment
ago
it
was
however
that
i
had
seen
clearly
and
enough
of
the
cheapness
and
betrayal
that
comes
of
such
irregular
relations
to
be
warned
if
only
it
were
possible
for
women
to
be
warned
against
trusting
what
i
wanted
of
course
was
some
such
sane
and
open
passion
as
i
appreciated
between
the
hardings
and
mark
eversley
and
his
wife
noble
extenuating
without
a
shadow
of
wavering
how
when
i
was
able
to
conceive
such
a
relation
and
to
discriminate
it
so
readily
from
the
ruck
of
affairs
like
jerry
and
my
leading
man
i
came
finally
to
miss
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
must
have
been
written
in
my
destiny
perhaps
the
distributers
of
the
gift
were
jealous
the
beginning
of
the
new
coil
of
my
affairs
was
in
sarah
going
on
the
road
early
in
january
and
my
finding
myself
rather
lonely
in
consequence
and
going
out
rather
too
often
to
the
mcdermotts
jerry
had
settled
his
family
at
street
then
in
that
intermediate
region
which
was
at
that
time
neither
city
nor
suburb
jerry
insisted
that
it
was
for
the
sake
of
the
park
for
the
children
though
most
of
jerry
friends
were
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
rather
for
the
very
thing
for
which
they
made
use
of
it
an
excuse
for
calling
infrequently
no
one
could
be
on
a
footing
of
any
intimacy
with
jerry
without
being
set
upon
by
the
little
foxes
of
suspicion
and
jealousy
which
gnawed
upon
the
bosom
that
nursed
them
connubial
misery
was
a
kind
of
drug
with
her
the
habit
of
which
she
could
no
more
leave
off
than
any
drunkard
or
than
jerry
could
his
sentimentalized
innocuous
infatuations
all
this
comes
into
my
story
for
slight
as
my
connection
was
with
jerry
affairs
in
my
capacity
as
confidante
it
served
to
set
in
motion
the
profound
confirming
experience
of
my
art
or
perhaps
i
merely
seized
on
it
objectively
to
excuse
what
was
really
the
compulsion
of
the
gods
i
could
have
gone
anywhere
out
of
new
york
to
separate
myself
from
jerry
affair
that
i
should
have
chosen
to
go
to
london
is
the
best
evidence
perhaps
that
i
was
not
really
choosing
at
all
it
began
with
my
spending
mornings
in
the
park
with
jerry
children
who
were
nice
children
except
for
the
way
in
which
they
continually
reflected
in
their
attitude
toward
their
father
a
growing
consciousness
of
slighting
and
bitterness
at
home
jerry
made
a
point
of
her
generosity
in
rather
forcing
him
on
me
on
these
occasions
and
on
the
long
walks
which
i
fell
in
the
habit
of
taking
very
early
or
in
the
pale
twilight
whenever
affairs
at
the
theatre
would
permit
me
i
remember
how
the
spring
came
on
in
the
city
that
year
i
saw
it
go
with
the
children
to
school
in
a
single
treasured
blossom
or
trailing
the
sunday
trippers
in
dropped
sprays
of
hepatica
and
potentilla
back
from
the
jersey
shore
soft
airs
and
scents
of
the
field
invaded
the
town
and
played
in
the
streets
in
the
hours
when
men
were
not
using
them
a
spirit
out
of
hadley
pasture
came
and
walked
beside
me
but
it
was
not
due
to
any
suggestion
of
what
there
was
in
the
invading
season
for
me
that
jerry
occasionally
walked
along
with
me
for
the
chief
use
jerry
had
of
the
earth
was
to
build
cities
upon
jerry
drew
the
sap
of
his
being
out
of
asphalt
pavements
and
the
light
that
fanned
out
from
the
theatre
entrances
on
broadway
was
his
natural
aura
he
had
developed
he
had
branched
and
blossomed
in
the
degree
to
which
the
inspiration
of
his
work
had
been
squeezed
and
strained
through
layers
and
layers
of
humanity
and
the
more
he
was
played
upon
by
the
striped
and
passions
and
affections
of
society
the
more
delicate
and
fanciful
and
human
his
work
became
his
lean
figure
now
that
it
had
filled
out
a
little
was
built
to
be
the
absolute
excuse
for
evening
clothes
and
never
showed
to
such
an
advantage
as
in
their
sleek
satiny
blackness
with
a
good
deal
of
white
front
and
the
rather
wide
black
ribbon
to
his
glasses
which
brought
out
the
natural
pallor
of
his
skin
his
hair
which
he
wore
parted
very
far
at
one
side
and
made
to
curve
glossily
to
the
contour
of
his
head
was
more
like
a
raven
wing
than
ever
and
had
still
its
little
trick
of
erecting
slightly
and
spreading
in
excitement
especially
when
he
was
up
for
a
curtain
speech
and
was
in
the
way
he
looked
the
part
of
the
successful
dramatist
a
good
half
of
the
entertainment
his
contribution
to
the
occasion
on
which
i
was
good
enough
to
take
his
children
for
an
outing
to
the
bronx
or
van
cortlandt
park
was
made
by
lying
flat
on
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
under
his
head
waiting
until
i
had
exhausted
myself
with
games
before
he
was
able
to
take
any
interest
in
me
i
would
come
back
to
him
after
a
while
and
sit
on
the
grass
beside
him
jerry
way
of
acknowledging
the
pains
i
had
been
at
to
amuse
his
offspring
was
to
pat
one
of
my
elbows
with
a
hand
which
he
immediately
restored
to
its
business
of
propping
his
head
jerry
i
said
i
am
convinced
that
something
very
nice
is
about
to
happen
to
me
run
your
hands
over
the
tops
of
the
grass
here
and
you
can
feel
news
of
it
coming
up
through
the
stems
well
at
any
rate
you
can
take
it
when
it
comes
he
reminded
me
there
wo
be
anybody
to
be
hurt
by
your
good
times
but
yourself
jerry
is
it
as
bad
as
ever
so
bad
that
if
she
does
let
up
on
it
soon
i
shall
do
something
to
bring
on
a
crisis
and
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
regretting
it
besides
there
is
miss
doran
you
have
to
think
of
her
miss
doran
was
a
dancer
with
a
spirit
in
her
feet
and
a
south
jersey
accent
whose
effect
on
him
jerry
was
translating
into
quite
the
best
thing
he
had
done
it
was
however
that
i
cared
in
the
least
what
became
of
her
that
i
had
thrown
out
that
saving
suggestion
but
because
it
had
been
little
more
than
a
year
since
jerry
had
disturbed
the
peace
and
broken
the
not
heart
let
us
say
the
organ
of
her
literary
ineptitudes
of
mineola
maxon
freear
who
had
interviewed
him
once
and
taken
him
with
the
snare
of
a
superior
comprehension
mineola
had
advanced
ideas
as
to
the
relation
of
the
sexes
and
a
conviction
that
she
was
fitted
to
be
the
mentor
of
a
literary
career
and
had
missed
the
point
of
philanderings
quite
as
much
as
his
wife
missed
them
with
mineola
in
mind
and
the
tragedy
she
came
near
making
out
of
it
for
herself
i
ventured
on
a
word
of
caution
you
do
want
to
forget
jerry
that
there
one
good
thing
about
your
marriage
it
keeps
you
from
making
another
one
just
like
it
you
think
i
do
that
it
is
written
in
your
forehead
jerry
that
you
are
to
be
attracted
to
the
sort
of
woman
whom
you
have
the
least
use
for
the
kind
that
would
make
you
a
good
wife
you
could
possibly
love
well
enough
to
live
with
her
i
could
live
with
you
he
affirmed
then
it
would
be
because
you
have
never
been
in
love
with
me
look
here
jerry
what
does
the
other
all
amount
to
if
you
did
have
any
one
like
miss
doran
i
mean
do
you
mean
that
you
would
write
plays
at
all
i
write
them
harder
and
i
write
them
different
how
can
a
man
tell
this
thing
once
you
know
it
is
to
be
had
you
just
ca
hold
back
from
it
not
even
if
somebody
else
has
to
pay
why
should
they
jerry
sat
up
and
began
to
pull
up
the
grass
by
the
roots
and
throw
it
about
why
ca
they
see
that
all
a
man
wants
is
to
do
his
work
i
could
see
at
any
rate
that
he
was
near
the
breaking
point
and
i
knew
that
if
the
break
came
from
jerry
himself
it
would
be
irrevocable
that
was
what
put
me
in
the
notion
of
going
away
immediately
i
had
barely
saved
my
face
with
jerry
in
the
mineola
affair
and
i
thought
if
there
was
to
be
another
crisis
i
had
better
clear
out
before
it
i
had
put
off
deciding
about
my
vacation
until
i
could
hear
from
sarah
who
was
playing
in
the
west
and
rather
expected
to
go
on
to
the
coast
but
now
the
idea
of
getting
off
quite
by
myself
began
to
appeal
to
me
it
was
about
a
week
after
that
at
rector
where
i
had
gone
with
a
party
of
players
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
we
saw
jerry
come
in
with
the
dancer
and
an
air
that
said
plainly
that
he
knew
very
well
what
a
married
man
laid
himself
open
to
when
he
came
into
a
place
like
that
with
clare
doran
i
watched
them
by
snatches
all
through
the
supper
before
i
made
up
my
mind
to
send
the
waiter
to
touch
him
on
the
sleeve
and
apprise
him
that
i
was
there
what
deterred
me
was
the
reflection
that
if
it
came
into
jerry
poor
befuddled
head
to
make
a
case
of
his
being
seen
there
the
fact
that
i
had
stood
her
friend
would
in
the
least
prevent
her
from
having
me
up
as
a
witness
to
her
private
entertainments
i
seemed
to
see
in
the
set
of
jerry
shoulders
that
he
expected
that
his
wife
would
do
something
and
that
it
would
be
unpleasant
the
necessity
of
taking
some
stand
myself
of
living
myself
for
or
against
jerry
connubial
independence
had
cleared
my
soul
of
sundry
vagrant
impulses
and
left
the
call
of
destiny
sounding
plain
above
the
din
of
supper
and
the
gurgle
of
soft
sophisticated
laughter
the
authority
of
that
call
coupled
no
doubt
with
some
annoyance
at
jerry
for
putting
me
in
a
place
where
i
had
to
decide
against
him
led
me
to
break
it
to
him
there
that
i
was
about
to
leave
him
with
his
situation
on
his
hands
rather
than
at
a
less
public
occasion
he
came
at
once
with
his
napkin
trailing
from
his
hand
and
his
wing
falling
forward
over
his
pale
forehead
as
he
stooped
to
me
i
was
wanting
to
see
you
i
said
as
i
put
up
my
hand
to
him
over
the
back
of
the
chair
i
shall
be
leaving
the
next
day
after
we
close
for
where
london
i
told
him
i
shall
be
in
time
for
the
best
of
the
theatrical
season
there
i
had
thought
of
that
as
a
reason
until
that
moment
besides
i
am
crazy
to
go
i
smell
primroses
nonsense
that
moet
besides
you
never
smelled
them
so
how
should
you
know
that
was
true
enough
sarah
and
i
had
had
six
weeks
of
paris
the
summer
before
and
a
week
in
london
in
august
where
it
rained
most
of
the
hours
of
every
day
but
as
i
said
the
word
i
realized
that
what
had
been
pulling
at
my
heart
was
the
feel
of
the
london
pavements
with
the
smell
of
the
dust
in
the
hot
intervals
between
the
showers
and
the
deep
red
of
the
roses
the
boys
cried
in
the
street
jerry
stood
looking
down
on
me
and
his
face
was
troubled
i
do
blame
you
for
going
come
too
jerry
bring
the
wife
and
babies
miss
doran
was
tired
of
sitting
alone
so
long
she
stood
up
as
if
for
going
a
flicker
of
consternation
passed
in
his
face
between
his
divided
interest
and
a
suspicion
of
the
reason
for
my
desertion
look
here
olivia
oh
impossible
it
was
plain
that
the
dancer
was
going
to
make
it
uncomfortable
for
him
for
taking
so
much
time
to
his
i
see
you
at
your
steamer
he
clasped
my
hand
with
a
detaining
gesture
i
could
see
him
looking
back
at
me
from
the
doorway
as
though
for
the
moment
he
had
seen
my
destiny
hovering
over
me
i
have
often
wondered
if
jerry
had
provided
me
with
an
excuse
what
the
powers
would
have
done
about
getting
me
to
london
on
this
occasion
i
had
almost
a
mind
the
next
day
to
go
out
to
his
house
and
persuade
him
to
drop
everything
here
and
take
his
family
abroad
with
me
that
i
did
not
was
i
think
not
so
much
due
to
what
i
thought
such
a
plan
might
contribute
toward
the
saving
of
jerry
situation
as
the
conviction
as
soon
as
i
had
decided
that
whatever
it
was
that
lay
at
the
end
of
my
journey
i
was
called
to
it
i
was
as
certain
that
in
london
i
would
find
what
i
went
to
seek
as
though
it
had
been
printed
in
my
steamer
ticket
i
shut
up
the
house
and
left
the
key
of
the
flat
at
the
bank
a
letter
i
wrote
to
sarah
crossed
hers
to
me
saying
that
she
thought
she
would
stay
on
in
the
west
for
her
vacation
two
days
after
the
theatre
closed
for
the
season
i
sailed
for
london
chapter
ii
for
a
week
perhaps
i
was
content
merely
with
being
there
simply
happy
and
human
i
had
brought
letters
and
addresses
which
i
neglected
in
spite
of
the
excuse
i
had
made
to
jerry
about
it
i
did
not
even
go
to
the
theatres
i
turned
aside
from
the
traditional
goals
to
ride
on
the
top
of
omnibuses
and
walk
miles
down
the
strand
and
piccadilly
touching
shoulders
with
the
crowd
the
thing
that
i
had
striven
for
in
my
art
what
men
paint
and
write
and
act
for
was
upon
me
answers
to
all
the
questions
about
it
that
i
had
not
the
skill
to
put
to
myself
lurked
for
me
behind
the
next
one
of
the
greek
marbles
and
the
next
the
pictures
were
luminous
with
it
in
the
soft
spring
nights
it
took
the
streets
and
turned
the
voices
happy
it
danced
with
the
maids
in
the
alleyways
to
the
tune
of
the
barrel
organs
then
all
at
once
i
had
a
scare
seemed
about
to
take
flight
i
would
be
smiling
at
it
secretly
i
would
catch
myself
in
the
motion
of
saluting
it
and
suddenly
it
would
be
gone
mornings
i
would
wake
up
in
chicago
to
the
old
struggle
and
depression
i
would
have
to
go
out
in
the
streets
and
court
back
my
joy
it
fled
from
me
and
concealed
itself
in
the
crowd
i
followed
it
by
the
trail
of
the
first
name
i
lighted
on
in
my
it
happened
to
be
franklin
shane
i
wrote
her
a
note
and
then
walked
out
in
hyde
park
to
see
the
last
of
the
rhododendrons
and
regretted
it
franklin
shane
was
pauline
mills
raised
to
the
power
which
i
did
not
fail
to
perceive
was
due
to
franklin
shane
being
henry
multiplied
by
a
million
the
acute
sense
of
values
which
had
established
pauline
at
the
centre
of
evanston
had
landed
shane
at
the
outer
rim
of
english
exclusiveness
what
she
would
do
with
her
time
and
energy
when
she
had
penetrated
to
its
royal
core
interested
me
immensely
i
had
been
entertained
at
her
house
the
previous
winter
when
i
had
been
studying
a
play
that
made
me
perfectly
willing
to
be
exploited
by
franklin
shane
for
the
sake
of
what
i
got
out
of
it
to
fatten
my
part
there
in
london
she
called
for
me
in
her
car
the
afternoon
of
the
day
that
brought
her
my
note
i
do
remember
that
anything
was
expressly
said
about
it
but
it
was
in
the
air
that
franklin
shane
had
arrived
in
her
study
of
exclusiveness
at
knowing
that
the
younger
members
of
it
were
addicted
to
the
society
of
ladies
of
my
profession
and
meant
to
make
the
most
of
me
i
thought
it
might
be
amusing
to
see
what
supposing
with
me
as
a
tolerable
bait
she
could
catch
a
younger
son
she
would
do
with
him
she
was
clever
enough
not
to
put
the
use
she
was
to
make
of
me
too
obviously
i
was
invited
to
an
informal
reception
the
next
afternoon
in
which
she
found
herself
involved
by
her
husband
business
exigencies
i
gathered
from
her
way
of
speaking
of
it
that
the
guests
were
chiefly
americans
and
that
she
had
made
the
best
of
the
situation
extracting
from
it
for
herself
a
kernel
of
credit
by
not
turning
down
her
compatriots
now
that
she
was
assured
of
having
the
english
aristocracy
to
play
with
the
house
in
front
of
which
a
hansom
deposited
me
the
next
day
was
notable
one
could
guess
that
the
franklin
shanes
had
been
made
to
pay
a
pretty
penny
for
the
privilege
of
occupying
it
it
was
stuffed
full
of
the
treasures
of
four
hundred
years
of
the
selective
instinct
you
must
really
see
the
velasquez
my
hostess
had
confided
to
me
as
soon
as
i
had
shaken
hands
with
her
and
i
judged
from
the
fact
of
her
not
mentioning
my
name
to
any
other
of
her
guests
that
she
was
saving
me
for
a
special
introduction
the
velasquez
was
very
wonderful
there
was
also
an
early
holbein
and
a
titian
so
black
with
time
that
there
was
only
one
point
in
the
room
from
which
you
could
make
out
what
it
was
about
i
was
slowly
making
my
way
to
that
point
i
had
been
in
the
house
half
an
hour
and
had
met
but
one
or
two
people
whom
i
slightly
knew
when
i
was
aware
of
my
hostess
piloting
toward
me
through
the
press
a
male
in
whom
i
suspected
one
of
the
pegs
upon
which
her
social
venture
hung
it
occurred
to
me
that
she
had
sent
me
to
look
at
the
pictures
so
that
she
might
know
where
to
find
me
the
room
was
packed
with
americans
satisfying
in
the
only
way
open
to
them
a
natural
curiosity
as
to
the
shell
in
which
the
only
kind
of
society
which
was
open
to
them
lived
and
the
man
blocking
out
a
passage
through
it
with
his
shoulders
was
so
tall
that
it
brought
my
eyes
on
a
level
with
his
necktie
there
was
an
odd
freedom
about
it
that
set
me
at
once
to
correct
my
impression
of
him
by
his
face
and
the
moment
i
raised
my
eyes
to
him
i
knew
him
i
could
hear
franklin
shane
mumbling
the
phrases
of
introduction
rendered
unimportant
by
the
radiant
recognition
that
for
the
moment
enveloped
us
that
burst
around
us
as
a
flame
in
which
our
hostess
seemed
to
shrivel
and
go
out
in
a
thin
haze
of
silk
and
chiffon
i
remember
looking
around
for
her
presently
and
wondering
how
she
had
got
away
from
us
we
began
again
at
the
point
where
we
had
left
off
so
you
did
go
on
the
stage
then
in
spite
of
taylorville
and
you
i
pressed
my
foot
into
the
velvet
pile
of
the
carpet
to
make
sure
that
i
stood
you
are
an
engineer
i
suppose
in
spite
of
my
uncle
somewhere
in
the
next
room
some
one
began
to
sing
i
did
not
hear
the
song
nor
see
the
titian
i
was
back
in
willesden
pasture
and
the
soft
rain
of
dying
leaves
was
on
my
face
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
his
hand
which
he
had
laid
upon
my
arm
to
steady
me
against
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
which
swayed
and
turned
upon
itself
to
let
shane
through
to
drag
me
to
be
presented
to
the
singer
who
was
even
more
of
a
notability
than
i
was
there
was
an
interval
then
in
which
i
appeared
to
be
going
through
the
forms
of
society
and
going
through
them
under
an
intolerable
sense
of
injustice
in
the
fact
that
having
found
helmeth
garrett
at
last
now
i
had
lost
him
it
was
one
of
those
occasions
when
the
inward
monitor
is
so
bent
on
its
own
affairs
that
the
habit
of
living
goes
on
automatically
or
does
not
go
on
at
all
it
went
on
so
with
me
for
half
an
hour
by
degrees
what
seemed
an
immense
unbearable
throbbing
of
the
universe
resolved
itself
at
the
renewal
of
that
electrifying
touch
on
my
arm
to
the
thrum
of
an
orchestra
in
the
refreshment
room
i
felt
myself
carried
along
by
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
in
that
direction
but
just
at
the
turn
of
the
stair
that
went
down
to
it
i
was
drawn
peremptorily
aside
come
garrett
insisted
come
out
of
this
i
want
to
talk
to
you
there
was
the
old
imperiousness
in
his
manner
exclusive
of
all
other
considerations
he
seemed
to
know
the
house
we
took
a
turn
through
the
hall
came
out
presently
at
the
where
a
line
of
carriages
waited
supported
by
a
line
of
figures
like
little
wooden
noahs
before
an
ark
i
let
him
put
me
into
a
closed
carriage
without
a
word
of
protest
i
had
not
taken
leave
of
my
hostess
i
had
not
so
much
as
thought
of
her
i
suppose
he
had
been
arranging
this
in
the
interval
in
which
i
had
not
seen
him
the
moment
the
door
of
the
carriage
was
shut
we
clasped
hands
and
laughed
shamelessly
you
had
three
little
freckles
high
up
on
your
cheek
what
became
of
them
he
demanded
all
at
once
his
mood
changed
again
all
the
years
i
been
without
you
i
saw
a
picture
of
you
in
a
magazine
three
years
ago
in
alaska
i
came
near
writing
you
should
have
what
were
you
doing
there
promoting
engineer
alaska
russia
mexico
he
began
a
gesture
to
include
the
whole
round
of
the
mining
world
but
left
off
to
take
my
hand
again
the
world
round
he
declared
as
though
he
had
somewhat
doubted
it
it
brings
us
back
again
to
the
old
starting
points
they
always
the
same
i
suppose
the
places
we
set
out
from
but
we
we
are
never
the
same
is
that
a
warning
he
looked
at
me
checked
for
a
moment
only
a
platitude
i
had
thrown
it
out
instinctively
against
his
engulfing
manner
against
everything
that
rose
up
in
me
to
assure
me
that
nothing
whatever
had
changed
that
it
would
never
change
the
life
of
the
london
streets
streamed
around
us
crossing
piccadilly
circus
we
were
held
up
with
the
traffic
the
roar
of
the
city
islanded
us
like
a
sea
i
suppose
you
know
where
we
are
going
i
suggested
in
one
of
the
checked
intervals
to
your
hotel
shane
gave
me
the
address
i
told
her
we
were
old
friends
you
must
be
surprised
if
you
find
she
expects
us
to
have
gone
to
school
together
i
wanted
to
get
away
where
we
could
talk
i
gave
him
an
assenting
smile
still
neither
of
us
showed
any
disposition
to
begin
he
took
off
his
hat
in
the
carriage
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
about
the
temples
it
had
gone
gray
a
little
now
and
then
he
gave
a
short
contented
laugh
as
a
man
will
put
suddenly
at
ease
i
glad
you
kept
the
old
name
olivia
lattimore
olivia
i
should
have
found
you
without
you
knew
i
had
lost
my
husband
i
read
that
in
the
magazine
there
where
i
have
the
advantage
of
you
he
dropped
his
light
banter
for
a
soberer
tone
my
wife
died
two
years
ago
we
were
silent
after
that
until
the
fact
had
been
put
behind
us
by
a
space
of
time
i
do
know
why
london
seems
a
more
homey
place
than
new
york
it
has
been
going
on
so
long
perhaps
is
so
steeped
in
the
essential
essence
of
human
living
and
the
buildings
there
are
smaller
more
personal
the
mind
is
able
to
grasp
them
to
the
uttermost
i
remember
as
we
stopped
at
my
hotel
being
taken
suddenly
with
a
tremendous
awareness
of
it
all
the
noble
river
flowing
by
the
human
stream
miles
on
miles
of
homes
and
the
green
countryside
i
was
aware
of
a
city
set
in
an
island
and
an
island
in
the
sea
the
wide
immortal
sea
going
around
and
around
it
the
coursing
waves
i
checked
myself
in
an
upward
gesture
of
the
arms
as
though
i
had
pulsed
and
surged
with
it
i
caught
in
my
companion
smile
a
delighted
recognition
sh
he
said
what
flora
haines
think
of
you
flora
oh
flora
would
even
about
a
what
would
your
uncle
he
dead
now
he
stopped
me
they
are
all
dead
i
told
him
all
those
that
mattered
to
us
we
had
another
mood
when
we
came
to
my
rooms
i
perceived
suddenly
what
there
was
in
him
more
than
i
had
known
it
was
in
his
manner
that
he
had
commanded
men
i
was
pierced
through
with
a
sense
of
his
virility
the
quality
that
goes
to
make
a
male
i
was
glad
of
an
excuse
to
put
away
my
hat
and
wrap
to
escape
for
a
moment
from
the
effect
he
produced
on
me
from
inordinate
pride
in
him
that
he
could
so
produce
it
the
room
was
full
of
the
tumult
we
created
for
one
another
will
you
sit
here
i
said
at
last
i
believe
i
pushed
a
chair
toward
him
no
you
he
must
have
turned
it
back
toward
me
otherwise
i
do
not
know
how
i
came
to
be
so
near
him
you
know
i
said
i
never
got
your
letter
i
guessed
as
much
when
it
came
back
to
me
i
should
have
come
to
you
the
next
day
but
i
quarrelled
with
my
uncle
i
walked
all
the
way
to
the
railway
station
before
i
remembered
but
what
had
i
to
offer
you
it
was
so
long
ago
no
no
yesterday
his
arms
were
around
me
olivia
yesterday
and
i
think
i
moved
a
little
to
be
the
more
completely
engulfed
by
him
to
lay
against
his
the
ache
of
my
empty
breast
all
these
years
i
had
not
known
how
empty
we
kissed
at
last
and
joy
came
upon
us
we
loved
we
kissed
again
between
laughter
i
remember
little
snatches
of
explanation
in
the
intervals
of
kissing
all
this
time
helmeth
i
have
wanted
you
so
i
was
on
my
way
to
you
all
last
winter
in
alaska
in
the
long
night
olivia
i
should
have
come
soon
oh
i
cried
i
have
been
drawn
across
the
sea
to
you
all
the
way
i
felt
you
calling
we
had
to
meet
again
had
to
after
a
time
i
insisted
that
he
should
sit
down
you
have
had
any
tea
i
tried
to
get
control
of
myself
i
was
crossing
the
room
to
ring
when
he
swept
me
up
again
look
here
olivia
i
do
want
any
tea
i
want
you
god
he
said
do
you
know
how
i
want
you
all
at
once
i
was
crying
on
his
breast
oh
helmeth
helmeth
do
you
know
you
have
only
seen
me
twice
in
your
life
and
both
times
he
insisted
i
wanted
to
marry
you
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
we
spoke
of
marriage
again
i
believe
i
scarcely
thought
of
it
we
had
all
the
past
to
account
for
and
the
present
we
had
moments
of
strangeness
and
then
we
would
kiss
and
all
the
years
would
seem
to
each
of
us
as
full
of
the
other
as
the
very
hour
where
were
you
helmeth
the
second
summer
after
we
met
i
had
told
him
of
my
visit
to
chicago
and
the
dream
of
him
i
had
had
there
out
in
arizona
carrying
a
surveyor
chain
dreaming
of
often
when
the
moonlight
was
all
over
that
country
like
a
lake
i
would
walk
and
walk
i
had
long
talks
with
you
they
were
the
only
improving
conversation
i
had
for
years
i
said
that
dream
of
you
was
the
only
thing
that
kept
my
gift
awake
times
i
would
lose
it
and
then
i
would
dream
again
and
it
would
come
back
i
know
now
when
i
lost
it
completely
it
was
about
a
year
before
i
saw
you
that
time
in
chicago
i
had
told
him
of
that
too
that
year
i
married
i
could
see
that
there
was
something
in
the
recollection
always
that
weighed
upon
him
i
did
he
said
until
after
my
aunt
had
told
me
about
you
i
went
back
there
when
she
died
she
was
always
good
to
me
you
know
you
olive
that
in
spite
of
everything
everything
there
is
only
you
let
us
not
talk
of
it
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
proper
to
feel
on
such
occasions
but
i
supposed
that
he
must
have
had
as
i
had
stinging
tears
to
think
of
the
dead
and
how
their
love
was
overmatched
by
this
present
wonder
i
would
have
had
somehow
tommy
and
my
boy
to
share
in
it
i
went
rather
tardily
to
make
my
apologies
to
franklin
shane
i
hope
they
sounded
natural
my
you
need
expect
me
to
be
surprised
at
helmeth
garrett
does
she
talked
habitually
in
italics
my
husband
says
that
it
is
only
because
he
so
generally
does
right
that
it
is
at
all
possible
to
get
along
with
him
i
snapped
up
crumbs
like
this
with
avidity
his
wife
too
you
must
have
known
her
i
hinted
this
was
at
the
end
of
a
rather
complete
account
of
helmeth
business
relations
with
shane
oh
well
i
could
see
christian
charity
struggling
with
profound
conviction
of
the
rectitude
of
her
own
way
of
life
she
was
a
woman
but
no
imagination
she
was
so
pleased
to
have
hit
upon
a
word
which
carried
no
intrinsic
condemnation
that
she
repeated
it
no
imagination
whatever
one
feels
she
modified
the
edge
of
her
judgment
still
further
that
so
much
might
have
been
made
out
of
garrett
these
men
are
so
difficult
are
you
difficult
i
demanded
when
i
had
retailed
the
conversation
to
him
that
evening
i
suppose
so
anyway
i
am
she
is
right
so
far
i
dare
say
it
is
badly
done
you
have
to
take
a
few
tucks
in
me
not
a
tuck
i
like
you
the
way
you
are
oh
i
like
you
i
like
you
there
was
an
interval
after
this
before
we
could
go
on
again
tell
me
how
you
made
yourself
helmeth
do
leave
anything
out
not
a
single
thing
by
mistakes
mostly
every
time
i
had
made
one
i
knew
it
was
a
mistake
and
i
did
do
it
again
i
do
know
that
i
much
of
a
success
anyway
but
i
got
a
large
assortment
of
things
not
to
do
that
was
the
way
i
learned
how
to
act
filling
in
behind
i
thought
that
came
by
instinct
what
counts
with
a
man
is
not
so
much
getting
to
know
how
to
do
it
but
getting
a
chance
to
prove
to
other
people
that
he
knows
how
i
been
through
that
too
i
told
him
but
he
was
bent
on
making
himself
clear
i
suppose
i
ought
to
tell
you
olivia
i
only
a
sort
of
scab
engineer
i
have
any
papers
but
if
you
can
do
the
work
shane
said
oh
shane
will
trust
me
he
learned
what
hurts
is
to
have
worked
up
a
scheme
to
the
point
where
it
is
necessary
to
have
outside
capital
and
then
have
one
of
the
outsiders
stick
out
for
a
certificated
engineer
that
what
comes
of
my
uncle
notion
that
a
man
should
up
his
professional
training
there
was
the
core
of
that
old
bitterness
rankling
in
him
still
he
could
not
yield
himself
quite
to
consolation
but
you
have
got
on
helmeth
you
got
what
here
meant
to
me
exactly
was
more
than
my
lover
more
than
the
pleasant
room
behind
us
the
obsequious
servitors
more
even
than
the
sleek
silvered
river
and
the
towered
banks
that
took
on
shapes
of
romance
under
the
london
gray
there
was
something
in
the
word
to
me
of
fulfilment
the
knowledge
of
things
done
the
certainty
of
an
unassailed
capacity
for
doing
we
were
sitting
with
the
broad
window
flung
open
the
top
of
a
lime
tree
tapping
the
sill
of
it
with
soft
shouldering
touches
as
of
some
wild
creature
against
its
mate
creaking
a
little
in
somnolent
content
i
put
out
my
hand
to
touch
his
knee
oh
as
i
might
have
done
it
if
the
here
had
been
the
point
toward
which
we
had
travelled
together
all
these
years
he
laughed
then
as
he
often
did
when
i
touched
him
a
man
short
full
laugh
of
repletion
he
thrust
out
his
knee
quite
frankly
till
it
touched
mine
and
closed
his
hand
over
my
fingers
he
returned
to
what
had
been
in
the
air
the
previous
moment
with
an
effort
the
suspicion
that
it
was
an
effort
was
all
i
had
to
prepare
me
for
what
was
about
to
leap
upon
me
oh
i
pulled
through
i
pulled
through
but
i
not
where
i
might
have
been
and
i
not
rich
olivia
not
what
is
called
rich
is
being
called
rich
one
of
the
things
that
goes
with
what
was
it
you
called
yourself
a
promoting
engineer
it
goes
with
it
if
you
are
any
good
at
it
not
that
i
care
about
money
except
for
what
it
stands
for
and
then
there
are
the
girls
you
have
girls
it
struck
me
as
absurd
that
i
had
thought
of
it
until
that
moment
i
thought
shane
would
have
told
you
i
have
two
it
is
going
to
make
any
difference
with
you
olivia
ah
what
difference
should
it
make
i
was
apprised
within
me
by
the
haste
i
made
to
cover
my
consternation
that
there
was
more
difference
in
it
than
my
words
allowed
children
of
yours
i
said
so
much
more
of
you
for
me
to
love
the
apprehension
was
whelmed
in
the
possessing
movement
with
which
he
drew
me
to
his
breast
chapter
iii
we
had
to
go
back
to
the
subject
of
course
it
could
be
left
hanging
in
the
air
like
that
it
was
a
day
or
two
later
at
hampton
court
where
we
had
gone
for
no
reason
really
except
that
it
seemed
a
more
commensurate
background
for
what
was
going
on
in
us
the
identification
in
each
by
the
other
of
the
springs
of
immortal
passion
we
had
roved
through
all
the
rooms
recharged
for
us
with
the
exceptional
experience
and
come
out
at
last
on
the
river
bank
where
there
was
quite
a
holiday
air
among
the
houseboats
behind
us
we
could
hear
the
soft
slither
of
the
fountain
in
the
sunk
garden
the
warm
sun
streaming
on
us
through
the
filmy
air
the
flutter
of
curtains
in
the
houseboats
above
the
little
pots
of
geraniums
the
voices
of
young
people
laughing
and
calling
across
began
to
steal
across
my
mind
with
a
sense
of
the
extraordinary
richness
of
life
here
was
all
the
stuff
of
which
i
had
built
up
my
earliest
dreams
of
the
shining
destiny
young
people
growing
up
about
me
room
to
stretch
my
capacity
to
the
uttermost
the
orderly
social
procedure
for
the
moment
i
believed
that
i
might
turn
back
on
that
path
my
feet
had
failed
in
and
find
in
it
all
that
i
had
missed
i
recalled
that
there
were
always
children
in
my
dream
for
the
instant
they
were
back
little
heads
and
faces
all
the
eyes
on
me
soft
curls
like
wisps
of
gossamer
i
suppose
there
must
be
such
little
unclaimed
souls
forever
hovering
and
flitting
little
winged
things
to
love
mighty
candle
what
should
there
be
in
the
touch
of
a
man
hand
on
a
woman
that
they
should
come
crowding
to
it
like
homing
doves
there
was
a
maid
going
by
with
her
charge
one
of
those
glowing
english
children
who
supply
us
with
the
images
by
which
we
prefigure
the
angelic
choirs
helmeth
held
out
his
hand
to
the
boy
and
with
that
swift
spark
that
passes
between
the
young
and
those
by
whom
they
are
beloved
he
toddled
forward
and
laid
hold
of
the
inviting
finger
if
i
had
had
more
experience
of
the
pang
that
shot
through
me
then
i
should
have
known
it
for
jealousy
it
drove
me
on
toward
what
until
now
i
had
avoided
tell
me
about
your
girls
helmeth
he
felt
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
if
you
would
care
to
see
them
he
was
so
pleased
and
shy
i
suppose
he
must
have
understood
better
than
i
how
it
was
with
me
they
are
with
an
aunt
in
los
angeles
it
was
handier
for
me
to
see
them
when
i
ran
up
from
mexico
they
are
rather
decent
kiddies
you
see
them
when
they
come
to
new
york
this
winter
shall
you
be
in
new
york
it
struck
coldly
on
me
that
he
should
speak
of
plans
that
seemed
to
be
going
on
regardless
of
the
extraordinary
interruption
of
our
love
until
i
get
this
mexican
scheme
on
its
feet
i
shall
be
going
back
and
forth
they
look
like
their
mother
i
suggested
i
was
looking
still
at
the
small
rather
pale
photographs
he
had
handed
me
because
they
look
so
little
like
me
you
forget
i
saw
her
once
in
chicago
i
remember
you
know
i
think
i
went
there
that
time
because
i
heard
you
were
playing
there
he
was
silent
a
moment
pitching
bits
of
sod
into
the
river
there
is
something
that
manages
these
things
if
i
had
met
you
then
we
could
have
been
like
this
and
we
might
never
have
met
again
when
he
said
like
this
he
had
touched
my
knee
with
his
hand
with
that
possessive
intimacy
with
which
a
man
may
touch
his
own
woman
i
had
to
go
back
to
the
photographs
of
the
children
to
save
myself
from
the
blinding
lightning
of
his
eyes
they
like
their
mother
i
suppose
so
i
hope
so
she
was
a
good
woman
i
sure
of
that
he
sat
up
with
intention
ah
it
is
just
a
sense
of
what
is
due
her
that
makes
me
say
that
she
was
thoroughly
good
when
i
met
her
out
in
idaho
she
was
my
daughter
and
the
only
nice
girl
in
the
place
she
was
what
you
are
no
other
woman
is
but
she
was
one
of
those
plain
quiet
women
that
have
a
kind
of
a
grip
on
rightness
there
was
nothing
could
make
her
let
go
my
mother
was
like
that
i
think
i
can
understand
well
it
was
mighty
good
for
me
i
a
bad
lot
i
suppose
i
always
want
things
harder
than
most
and
i
think
the
wanting
justifies
me
in
getting
them
but
she
taught
me
better
she
did
things
to
me
that
made
me
fit
for
you
and
i
do
want
us
to
forget
that
oh
my
dear
it
is
i
who
am
not
fit
but
i
could
see
he
did
not
believe
that
he
had
come
upon
me
that
day
in
the
woods
when
happily
the
mood
of
perdita
had
shut
round
the
odd
blundering
olivia
like
an
enchanter
bubble
through
which
iridescent
surfaces
he
was
always
to
see
me
and
by
the
mere
act
of
loving
he
had
fixed
me
in
my
happiest
moment
he
was
the
only
man
i
ever
knew
whom
i
could
handle
like
an
audience
perhaps
he
was
the
only
man
who
never
knew
me
in
any
other
character
than
the
lady
of
romance
we
went
that
evening
to
see
beerbohm
tree
in
a
shakespearian
piece
always
so
much
more
worth
while
in
london
than
anything
the
same
people
can
do
on
any
other
soil
as
if
the
play
had
mellowed
there
by
all
the
rich
life
it
tapped
with
its
roots
borne
up
by
my
mood
and
the
beauty
of
the
production
so
much
greater
than
anything
we
could
manage
in
new
york
at
that
time
i
was
chanting
bits
of
it
all
the
way
home
and
when
we
came
to
my
room
again
i
moved
before
him
in
the
part
of
egypt
queen
who
born
the
day
when
i
forget
to
send
to
antony
shall
die
a
beggar
oh
helmeth
if
you
could
just
see
me
do
it
i
was
aching
to
lay
up
my
gift
before
him
as
on
an
altar
you
shall
do
them
all
for
me
when
we
are
out
in
the
shack
in
mexico
mexico
i
was
blank
for
the
moment
we
have
to
live
there
for
a
few
years
until
i
get
this
scheme
on
its
legs
look
here
olivia
you
have
said
yet
when
you
are
going
to
marry
me
i
only
known
you
four
days
i
tried
for
the
note
of
feminine
evasion
four
days
and
an
afternoon
to
be
exact
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
when
you
are
made
for
me
do
you
like
this
helmeth
he
caught
me
to
him
with
that
frank
delight
in
the
pressure
of
his
arm
about
my
body
the
feel
of
his
cheek
against
mine
that
was
as
fresh
to
me
as
water
in
a
wilderness
it
not
this
i
objecting
to
but
the
trouble
i
shall
have
doing
without
you
he
let
me
go
at
that
as
though
he
would
not
add
the
persuasion
of
his
touch
to
what
he
had
to
say
the
truth
is
i
no
business
to
ask
a
woman
to
marry
me
for
the
next
two
years
i
pledged
to
this
mexican
proposition
i
staked
all
i
have
on
it
and
i
asked
other
men
to
put
their
money
in
and
i
go
back
on
it
i
shall
have
to
be
back
and
forth
between
london
and
new
york
and
the
mines
for
at
least
a
couple
of
years
if
it
was
for
wanting
you
so
but
now
that
i
found
you
again
i
know
there
no
going
on
without
you
he
turned
his
face
toward
me
that
i
might
see
the
lines
of
anxious
thought
there
the
buffetings
and
disappointings
and
through
it
all
the
plain
hunger
of
the
man
for
his
natural
mate
i
saw
that
and
i
did
flinch
from
it
i
took
his
face
between
my
hands
and
drew
it
down
to
my
breast
i
under
contract
for
the
next
year
i
told
him
i
signed
just
before
i
left
what
does
it
all
matter
ca
we
be
just
engaged
we
be
engaged
to
be
married
and
i
could
take
you
to
mexico
on
an
engagement
i
under
contract
i
told
him
again
you
mean
to
say
that
you
go
on
acting
after
we
were
married
it
is
worth
while
retailing
what
we
said
after
that
it
has
been
said
so
many
times
it
was
the
same
thing
that
tommy
said
better
put
more
fully
he
was
ready
you
understand
to
make
concession
to
my
liking
for
the
stage
to
feel
himself
sincerely
a
poor
substitute
for
what
i
had
got
for
myself
out
of
living
but
there
it
was
at
the
end
that
he
could
make
for
his
own
work
the
concessions
he
demanded
of
mine
we
would
have
to
live
in
mexico
he
said
at
last
incontrovertible
and
besides
there
are
the
kiddies
to
think
of
their
mother
would
want
them
brought
up
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
stage
he
had
me
there
i
thought
of
miss
dean
and
griffin
of
the
cecelia
brunes
i
had
known
and
polatkin
tracing
the
outline
of
my
figure
with
his
fat
forefinger
i
would
either
and
my
frank
admission
of
it
brought
us
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
controversy
to
the
community
of
our
love
again
you
understand
do
you
that
i
feel
even
more
obligation
to
her
i
nodded
i
understood
fully
that
obstinate
trace
of
disloyalty
that
came
of
his
having
given
himself
to
what
she
would
approve
of
to
what
he
could
for
decency
sake
admit
of
giving
her
daughters
i
know
what
people
think
of
the
life
of
the
stage
i
agreed
and
i
know
what
worse
that
most
of
it
is
true
not
that
it
need
to
be
but
it
has
got
in
the
habit
of
being
so
well
then
if
you
feel
that
way
the
inference
was
plain
that
he
did
know
in
that
case
why
i
held
on
to
it
it
has
got
into
my
blood
helmeth
i
ca
explain
and
i
realize
until
we
got
to
talking
of
it
but
i
do
believe
i
could
live
away
from
it
it
is
with
me
as
it
is
with
you
about
your
engineering
if
i
had
a
momentary
qualm
lest
that
last
should
be
not
quite
disingenuous
it
passed
in
the
realization
that
the
comparison
come
home
to
him
i
remembered
how
forester
would
have
accepted
the
abnegation
of
my
gift
to
his
necessity
of
being
important
and
i
hold
it
out
against
helmeth
that
he
failed
to
realize
at
all
the
place
that
my
work
occupied
just
as
work
in
the
scheme
of
my
existence
we
came
back
to
it
the
next
day
and
the
next
it
would
have
been
simpler
of
course
if
it
had
been
for
the
children
and
for
my
being
at
one
with
him
in
the
opinion
that
the
stage
was
the
proper
atmosphere
for
the
rearing
of
young
ladies
i
was
still
of
the
opinion
which
was
exemplified
in
so
far
as
i
knew
it
by
pauline
and
franklin
shane
that
the
function
of
mothering
could
not
go
on
except
by
complete
separateness
from
the
business
of
making
a
living
all
my
training
and
heredity
had
fostered
an
ideal
of
family
life
which
rendered
obligatory
a
proper
house
and
servants
in
the
neighbourhood
of
good
schools
and
the
exclusion
from
it
of
everybody
but
those
who
found
themselves
in
an
identical
situation
and
if
we
had
been
able
to
imagine
a
compromise
helmeth
and
i
would
have
been
hindered
by
the
defrauded
capacity
for
loving
from
working
it
out
logically
at
the
mere
suggestion
of
anything
to
drive
us
apart
the
mating
instinct
set
us
toward
one
another
irresistibly
we
would
leave
off
any
argument
and
fall
to
kissing
we
were
pierced
through
and
through
with
loving
let
us
not
think
of
it
any
more
something
will
work
out
for
us
let
us
just
be
happy
the
way
we
are
i
would
protest
oh
child
child
will
you
never
understand
that
the
way
we
are
is
what
is
so
hard
to
bear
then
he
would
snatch
me
up
until
the
suffusing
fire
of
his
caress
would
steal
through
all
my
body
and
sing
in
me
like
bacchic
sap
of
vineyards
in
the
spring
you
ought
to
marry
me
unless
you
ca
help
yourself
he
would
laugh
shamelessly
so
we
fell
deeper
in
love
and
not
out
of
our
difficulties
toward
the
end
of
that
week
the
weather
which
had
been
thickening
to
a
storm
brought
us
to
one
of
those
thunderous
london
days
full
of
a
stifling
murk
that
might
have
been
breathed
out
by
the
nostrils
of
the
greasy
hurrying
snake
that
went
by
in
the
bed
of
the
river
inconsequential
lightnings
flashed
in
the
smoky
vault
from
every
quarter
of
which
rolled
unrelated
thunder
helmeth
came
over
from
shane
office
in
london
wall
the
need
we
had
of
being
together
was
oppressive
like
the
day
which
when
we
had
sought
it
in
the
park
we
could
hear
like
some
great
monster
bellowing
for
its
mate
we
went
out
and
walked
about
for
a
time
under
the
trees
fancying
the
relief
of
freshness
in
the
green
obscurity
that
under
the
ranked
trunks
thickened
to
blackness
no
one
was
about
but
a
few
belated
nursery
maids
scurrying
in
silhouette
against
the
pale
glow
of
the
light
pinned
down
and
imprisoned
under
the
thick
cloud
of
foliage
we
were
on
the
broad
walk
when
suddenly
a
wind
tore
loose
in
the
firmament
it
made
a
whirling
chaos
of
the
murk
it
wrung
the
treetops
but
the
air
along
the
ground
was
stagnant
as
a
cistern
now
and
then
a
few
great
drops
spattered
on
the
leaves
of
the
limes
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
us
near
the
alexandria
gate
the
tension
of
the
day
snapped
suddenly
in
flame
a
bolt
had
shattered
one
of
the
great
trees
straight
across
the
grass
toward
us
the
bolt
sped
like
a
ball
of
light
it
skimmed
the
ground
knee
high
flame
points
on
its
edges
flickered
viciously
as
it
drove
at
us
there
was
no
time
for
anything
helmeth
cried
out
to
me
once
and
i
stepped
within
the
circle
of
his
arms
we
could
hear
the
fire
ball
sizzling
as
it
cleared
the
grass
within
a
yard
of
us
it
went
out
in
a
flare
of
gas
and
a
crack
like
thunder
suddenly
buckets
of
rain
were
precipitated
on
us
we
could
hear
the
slap
of
them
on
the
pavement
as
we
ran
i
was
crying
hysterically
by
the
time
we
came
to
my
room
in
a
cab
i
remember
helmeth
trying
to
rid
me
of
my
wet
things
and
my
clinging
to
him
crying
oh
my
dear
my
dear
it
was
so
near
so
near
i
thought
i
was
to
lose
you
before
i
had
had
you
before
i
had
had
you
at
all
no
no
not
that
olivia
not
that
his
arms
were
around
me
and
all
my
life
up
to
that
moment
was
no
more
to
me
than
a
path
which
led
up
to
those
arms
i
remember
that
and
the
world
dissolving
in
the
wash
of
the
rain
outside
and
the
lift
of
his
breast
and
deep
under
all
old
unimagined
instincts
reared
their
heads
and
bayed
at
the
voice
of
their
master
chapter
iv
after
the
evening
of
the
storm
we
talked
no
more
of
marriage
for
a
while
and
about
a
week
later
i
went
over
to
paris
ostensibly
to
shop
and
was
joined
there
by
garrett
on
the
way
to
italy
i
suppose
that
italy
must
always
lie
like
some
lovely
sunken
island
at
the
bottom
of
all
passionate
dreams
from
which
at
the
flood
it
may
arise
the
air
of
it
is
charged
with
subtle
essences
of
romance
one
supposes
italy
must
be
organized
for
the
need
of
lovers
nothing
occurred
there
to
break
the
film
of
our
enchanted
bubble
for
a
month
we
kept
to
the
hill
towns
and
to
venice
where
we
could
go
about
in
the
conspicuous
privacy
of
a
gondola
and
all
that
time
we
met
nobody
we
had
ever
known
it
was
all
so
easily
managed
we
had
to
think
of
the
girls
of
course
no
one
seeing
our
registered
names
side
by
side
thomas
bettersworth
new
york
and
helmeth
garrett
chilicojote
mexico
would
have
thought
of
connecting
them
helmeth
attended
to
all
his
business
correspondence
as
though
he
were
still
in
london
and
nobody
expected
to
hear
from
me
in
any
case
it
is
strange
how
little
history
there
is
to
happiness
we
had
come
together
past
incredible
struggles
anxieties
triumphs
defeats
we
had
been
buffeted
and
stricken
and
now
suddenly
we
were
stilled
if
at
any
time
the
ghosts
of
the
uneasy
past
rose
upon
us
we
kissed
and
they
were
laid
so
long
as
we
kept
in
touch
there
ran
a
river
of
fire
between
our
blessed
isolation
and
the
world
and
for
the
first
time
we
looked
upon
the
world
free
of
the
obligations
of
our
being
in
it
we
looked
and
exchanged
our
separate
knowledges
as
precious
treasure
my
exploration
of
life
had
been
from
within
i
knew
what
raphael
was
thinking
about
when
he
painted
that
fine
blue
vein
on
his
wrist
but
helmeth
had
looked
on
the
movement
of
history
what
he
saw
in
italy
was
the
path
of
armies
lines
of
aqueducts
old
roman
roads
to
and
from
mines
everything
began
or
ended
for
him
in
a
mine
in
gaul
or
austria
or
ophir
dynasties
were
marked
for
him
by
change
in
the
ownership
of
mines
so
he
drew
me
the
white
roads
out
of
italy
as
one
draws
fibre
from
a
palm
and
strung
on
them
the
world
great
adventures
there
were
hours
also
when
we
let
all
this
great
fabric
of
art
and
history
float
from
us
sure
that
by
the
vitalizing
thread
of
understanding
which
ran
between
us
like
a
new
live
sense
we
could
pull
it
back
again
but
we
loved
we
loved
nothing
that
happened
to
us
there
came
with
a
more
revealing
touch
than
the
attitude
in
which
i
caught
myself
looking
out
for
and
being
surprised
at
not
discovering
in
myself
any
qualms
of
conscience
all
that
i
had
known
of
such
relations
in
other
people
had
made
itself
known
by
a
subtle
penetrating
fetid
savour
against
which
some
instinct
as
sure
as
a
hound
threw
up
its
head
and
bayed
the
tainted
air
but
in
my
own
affair
the
first
compulsion
that
irked
me
was
the
necessity
i
was
under
of
not
telling
anybody
i
was
conscious
at
any
time
of
any
feeling
that
would
have
gone
suitably
with
the
outward
form
of
marriage
there
were
times
even
when
i
failed
to
see
why
one
should
take
exception
to
the
neglect
of
such
form
i
was
remade
every
pulse
and
fibre
of
me
my
beloved
and
so
obviously
that
the
necessity
of
tagging
my
estate
with
a
ceremony
struck
me
as
an
impertinence
marriage
i
think
must
be
a
fact
capable
of
going
on
independently
of
the
prayer
book
and
the
county
clerk
whatever
may
think
no
god
could
have
escaped
the
certainty
of
my
being
duly
married
there
were
days
though
just
at
first
when
i
suffered
the
need
of
completing
my
condition
by
an
outward
bond
i
knew
very
well
where
the
custom
of
wedding
rings
came
from
i
should
have
worn
anklets
and
armlets
as
well
if
only
they
could
have
been
taken
as
the
advertisement
of
my
belonging
wholly
to
my
man
depend
upon
it
the
subjugation
of
woman
will
be
found
finally
to
rest
in
the
attempt
visibly
to
establish
what
the
woman
herself
concurs
in
the
inward
conviction
of
possession
how
much
of
what
was
in
my
own
mind
was
also
in
helmeth
i
do
not
know
but
because
i
had
brought
upon
myself
the
condition
of
not
being
married
i
failed
to
speak
of
what
i
found
regrettable
in
it
what
did
come
out
for
me
satisfyingly
was
the
man
sheer
content
in
his
mate
the
response
and
our
pride
in
it
of
his
blood
and
body
to
my
presence
and
the
new
relish
it
created
in
him
for
the
processes
of
living
for
his
pipe
and
his
meals
and
his
work
he
had
brought
some
estimates
to
figure
out
evenings
at
work
on
these
he
would
call
me
to
him
and
sit
with
his
left
arm
thrown
lightly
about
my
chair
the
pencil
going
as
though
my
presence
were
an
added
fillip
to
activity
he
took
on
weight
in
that
holiday
and
his
mouth
relaxed
to
a
more
youthful
curve
we
spent
the
last
three
weeks
of
it
at
a
quiet
hotel
on
the
point
of
land
that
divides
lake
como
from
lecco
opposite
cadenabbia
times
yet
i
will
wake
out
of
dreaming
to
find
the
pulse
of
the
city
transmuted
into
the
steady
lisping
of
that
silver
fretted
lake
we
had
come
to
a
phase
like
that
in
our
relation
deep
and
full
and
shining
we
spent
hours
sitting
on
the
parapet
in
the
sun
looking
at
it
i
would
sit
on
the
stone
ledge
and
helmeth
would
stretch
himself
with
his
pipe
along
the
ground
helmeth
i
said
on
such
a
morning
do
you
know
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
rested
he
gave
a
little
gurgle
of
content
the
sun
turned
on
the
sails
of
the
and
flashed
us
sympathy
i
afraid
i
admitted
i
never
going
to
want
to
do
anything
else
oh
i
going
to
want
to
this
is
good
enough
but
it
would
be
half
so
good
if
i
could
take
it
along
with
me
and
do
things
with
it
great
things
he
threw
his
arm
across
my
knees
with
one
of
those
quick
intimate
caresses
flooding
me
full
of
the
delighted
sense
of
how
completely
i
belonged
to
him
i
feel
he
said
as
if
i
had
been
going
about
with
one
arm
or
one
hand
and
now
i
got
a
full
set
of
them
wait
until
i
show
you
when
you
talk
of
doing
helmeth
that
means
leaving
me
that
for
you
to
say
olive
that
was
as
near
as
he
had
come
yet
to
reminding
me
that
it
was
i
who
had
chosen
this
instead
of
a
relation
which
would
have
implied
my
going
with
him
wherever
his
work
led
him
and
that
the
choice
was
still
open
to
me
the
night
after
the
storm
he
had
written
me
there
is
nothing
that
troubles
me
about
except
the
fear
that
you
may
regret
it
that
you
might
ever
come
to
have
a
doubt
of
how
i
feel
about
it
i
want
you
to
feel
that
whatever
you
choose
is
right
to
me
and
though
i
hope
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
make
you
my
wife
i
shall
not
urge
you
beyond
what
you
feel
that
you
can
do
without
urging
it
was
a
generous
letter
and
no
doubt
it
had
its
weight
in
persuading
me
to
trust
the
situation
in
the
face
of
that
instinct
which
saves
women
even
from
passions
that
seem
their
own
justification
if
he
had
counted
on
the
naturalness
of
love
to
set
up
its
own
public
obligation
he
had
not
been
far
wrong
with
me
if
it
had
been
practicable
i
should
have
walked
out
with
him
any
day
those
first
weeks
to
be
married
but
marriage
is
a
very
complicated
business
in
italy
in
a
measure
i
had
satisfied
my
fret
for
the
visible
tie
with
a
ring
which
he
had
bought
me
in
florence
which
as
the
stones
flashed
in
the
sun
turned
me
back
on
the
thought
i
had
when
first
he
set
it
on
my
hand
helmeth
do
you
suppose
that
we
are
pushed
on
to
make
laws
and
observances
about
marriage
because
the
bond
that
comes
into
being
then
has
a
consistency
and
validity
beyond
what
we
feel
about
it
oh
beyond
what
we
feel
about
it
yes
he
sat
up
then
a
little
away
from
me
as
he
often
did
when
he
drew
upon
experiences
lying
beyond
the
points
at
which
his
life
had
been
touched
by
mine
and
began
skipping
little
stones
into
the
water
yes
i
sure
that
what
you
feel
about
a
thing
that
happens
to
you
is
not
always
the
test
of
what
it
does
to
you
sometimes
i
think
feelings
have
much
to
do
with
our
experiences
except
to
get
us
into
them
he
left
off
skipping
stones
and
began
to
pile
them
into
a
little
heap
i
was
thinking
of
laura
he
concluded
it
was
not
often
that
he
spoke
to
me
of
his
wife
i
ca
remember
that
i
had
a
great
deal
of
feeling
about
her
i
was
too
busy
i
suppose
getting
on
with
my
engineering
but
she
had
a
grip
on
me
she
had
a
grip
look
here
my
dear
i
ought
to
tell
you
this
you
the
wonder
of
the
earth
for
me
and
i
know
very
well
that
my
wife
world
was
a
very
little
one
it
was
bounded
by
the
church
on
one
side
and
by
conventions
on
all
the
others
but
somehow
i
do
want
to
get
too
far
away
from
it
and
i
do
want
the
girls
to
get
too
far
he
swung
about
to
look
squarely
up
at
me
this
that
you
given
me
heaven
it
a
thing
for
a
man
to
die
for
and
die
happy
but
there
the
other
too
he
laughed
a
little
awkwardly
he
caught
my
feet
in
one
of
his
strong
hands
have
i
made
you
understand
i
understand
that
kind
of
life
it
like
a
clean
scrubbed
room
i
i
was
brought
up
in
it
there
have
been
times
when
i
have
been
desperate
because
i
could
go
back
and
live
there
but
i
ought
to
tell
you
helmeth
i
ca
find
my
way
back
you
why
should
you
you
were
made
to
live
in
kings
houses
but
i
wanted
to
be
sure
you
were
going
to
be
disappointed
if
i
have
the
manners
that
always
belong
to
palaces
i
been
in
camps
where
a
scrubbed
room
looked
mighty
good
to
me
he
stretched
himself
and
rolled
over
on
the
ground
lying
with
his
back
to
the
sun
soaking
in
it
in
simple
animal
content
little
white
flecks
showed
on
the
lake
the
sails
of
the
tilted
slowly
and
composed
themselves
anew
with
the
line
of
the
shore
and
the
flowing
hills
directly
opposite
the
walls
of
cadenabbia
showed
white
amid
the
green
like
a
little
streak
of
arcady
we
never
been
i
reminded
him
i
thought
you
wanted
to
leave
it
so
you
could
always
think
of
its
being
as
romantic
as
it
looks
without
making
sure
that
it
is
that
was
the
reason
i
had
given
him
but
the
truth
was
that
cadenabbia
was
on
one
of
those
tourist
routes
where
supposing
anybody
we
knew
to
be
wandering
about
europe
we
would
be
sure
to
run
into
them
this
morning
however
i
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
visit
it
but
supposing
it
is
as
interesting
as
it
looks
i
submitted
if
i
go
there
with
you
i
shall
never
know
it
and
think
how
disappointed
i
should
be
if
i
should
ever
come
there
without
you
and
find
that
it
is
the
one
place
we
ought
to
have
seen
there
was
a
little
motor
launch
plying
between
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
an
hour
before
tea
time
we
crossed
in
it
we
spent
the
hour
in
the
garden
of
the
duke
of
and
then
along
the
parapet
we
strolled
in
search
of
tea
it
was
the
height
of
the
tourist
season
and
the
gay
groups
moving
in
the
streets
between
the
quaint
low
houses
gave
it
a
holiday
air
we
heard
them
calling
one
to
the
other
exchanging
appreciations
and
information
all
at
once
we
heard
them
calling
us
garrett
garrett
a
party
in
the
act
of
settling
at
a
tea
table
in
the
garden
of
one
of
the
hotels
dissolved
and
reorganized
about
us
as
the
centre
there
was
laughter
and
garbled
greetings
and
handshaking
presently
helmeth
began
to
introduce
me
they
were
a
party
of
californians
all
more
or
less
acquainted
and
importunate
we
were
swept
back
by
them
to
the
table
and
tea
there
were
two
married
couples
and
one
unmarried
woman
of
about
my
age
and
a
boy
of
sixteen
i
could
see
by
the
way
she
appropriated
him
that
his
acquaintance
with
miss
stanley
had
been
of
the
degree
that
might
have
ripened
into
marriage
and
that
miss
stanley
had
not
wholly
made
up
her
mind
that
it
would
she
was
one
of
those
unmarried
women
who
contrive
by
a
multiplicity
and
vivacity
of
interests
to
deny
what
is
explicitly
advertised
by
their
anxiety
to
have
you
understand
that
they
consider
themselves
much
better
off
just
as
they
are
i
could
see
her
taking
in
all
the
details
of
my
appearance
to
find
the
key
to
what
garrett
might
presumably
like
in
me
and
striking
out
in
her
manner
to
him
a
quick
sketch
of
me
bettered
in
the
direction
of
what
she
believed
it
most
to
be
the
other
women
if
they
had
been
brought
up
in
taylorville
would
have
resembled
pauline
mills
that
they
did
i
could
see
was
difference
of
geography
they
were
all
full
of
gay
talk
and
reminiscence
of
a
mutual
life
in
the
west
on
a
footing
that
left
me
rather
more
than
room
to
play
the
part
which
i
had
cast
for
myself
with
celerity
of
being
a
casual
acquaintance
of
his
picked
up
at
a
hotel
he
had
introduced
me
to
them
as
bettersworth
and
whether
they
would
have
known
me
or
not
by
my
stage
name
i
took
care
they
should
have
the
opportunity
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
stay
to
dinner
i
guessed
that
there
was
that
degree
of
acquaintance
between
them
which
would
have
made
it
unfriendly
of
him
to
refuse
i
could
see
miss
stanley
prick
up
at
his
manner
of
leaving
the
decision
to
me
and
realized
that
whatever
we
might
have
agreed
upon
there
would
be
no
keeping
our
relation
from
being
at
least
a
matter
of
curiosity
to
the
women
the
elder
of
whom
had
promptly
included
me
in
the
invitation
i
invented
a
mythical
travelling
companion
across
the
lake
whom
i
must
join
and
managed
to
make
my
being
in
garrett
company
appear
so
casual
that
i
came
near
to
overdoing
it
by
exciting
his
concern
what
the
matter
do
you
like
them
he
wished
to
know
as
he
saw
me
to
the
landing
ever
so
i
insisted
promptly
but
they
would
like
me
after
a
while
you
behave
as
if
we
had
been
married
five
years
oh
well
have
we
he
looked
back
and
his
brow
gathered
a
little
for
two
cents
i
tell
them
but
after
all
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
see
me
comfortably
off
and
go
back
to
them
he
told
me
afterward
that
harwood
the
elder
of
the
two
gentlemen
had
been
useful
to
him
in
business
it
must
have
been
close
on
to
midnight
when
he
waked
me
sitting
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
he
must
have
gone
to
his
own
room
very
softly
meaning
not
to
disturb
me
now
i
heard
him
calling
my
name
in
a
whisper
and
his
hand
seeking
for
my
face
i
reached
up
and
drew
his
down
to
me
oh
my
dear
i
was
startled
at
what
i
found
there
beloved
why
are
you
crying
i
could
feel
him
shake
with
sudden
uncontrollable
emotion
i
kept
his
head
on
my
breast
and
comforted
him
when
did
you
come
in
an
hour
ago
you
were
asleep
the
commonplace
question
seemed
to
quiet
him
was
it
something
went
wrong
at
the
dinner
wrong
yes
but
not
there
not
there
it
all
wrong
it
has
been
wrong
from
the
beginning
dear
heart
tell
me
olive
marry
me
say
you
marry
me
there
was
urgency
in
his
whisper
there
was
pain
in
it
say
it
say
it
i
marry
you
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
ask
oh
my
dear
when
i
have
begged
you
so
tell
me
i
urged
there
is
anything
to
tell
only
we
walked
along
the
parapet
and
were
very
happy
together
they
a
good
sort
i
known
them
for
years
and
we
found
a
peasant
woman
selling
lace
good
lace
the
women
said
and
cheap
harwood
bought
some
for
his
wife
and
stanley
bought
his
sister
some
harwood
went
back
pretending
he
forgotten
something
and
bought
a
piece
his
wife
wanted
and
thought
she
afford
and
i
could
buy
you
any
not
openly
i
wanted
miss
stanley
to
select
some
handkerchiefs
that
i
said
were
for
the
girls
and
she
said
girls
should
wear
that
kind
oh
olive
do
you
understand
i
understand
you
shall
go
back
and
buy
me
some
but
it
wo
be
the
same
and
afterward
after
dinner
we
sat
in
the
garden
and
harwood
sat
with
his
arm
round
his
wife
chair
and
you
were
over
here
oh
olive
i
want
my
wife
i
want
her
in
the
light
before
everybody
i
want
her
i
was
crying
now
it
all
wrong
he
insisted
it
been
wrong
from
the
beginning
we
belong
together
before
everybody
he
kept
repeating
that
phrase
over
and
over
all
the
years
that
we
been
apart
and
now
just
to
have
it
in
a
hole
in
a
corner
no
no
my
dear
i
protested
before
god
it
been
before
god
we
sobbed
together
by
and
by
love
came
and
comforted
us
i
suppose
if
it
had
been
possible
to
go
out
and
be
married
immediately
we
should
have
married
the
next
morning
but
in
italy
there
are
observances
it
would
have
taken
three
weeks
at
least
and
hardly
less
in
switzerland
in
two
weeks
our
vacation
came
to
an
end
helmeth
set
out
by
the
shortest
route
for
mexico
and
i
interposed
a
week
shopping
between
me
and
franklin
shane
to
whom
i
had
pledged
myself
for
a
week
at
her
country
house
in
november
i
was
to
meet
helmeth
garrett
in
new
york
and
settle
things
he
had
stipulated
somehow
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
think
of
my
relation
to
him
as
involving
cataclysmal
changes
i
would
say
to
myself
that
i
intended
to
marry
him
and
i
could
say
that
i
would
chapter
v
within
a
week
after
my
return
polatkin
came
to
see
me
about
a
project
of
a
theatre
of
my
own
which
had
been
on
the
horizon
since
the
year
before
polatkin
himself
was
to
furnish
the
money
which
considering
what
he
had
made
out
of
me
under
our
earlier
contract
he
was
not
in
the
least
loath
to
do
he
could
understand
why
i
hesitated
is
it
that
you
think
you
are
getting
along
without
polatkin
well
you
can
try
i
hastened
to
reassure
him
well
then
are
you
getting
cold
feet
about
that
ravenscroft
woman
understand
me
she
ca
act
at
all
it
something
scandalous
the
way
she
tries
to
act
like
you
do
and
she
ca
if
i
was
her
manager
i
would
introduce
a
tight
rope
into
the
third
act
and
have
her
walk
it
but
what
i
would
have
something
that
was
copied
from
somebody
else
i
was
thinking
of
miss
ravenscroft
i
confessed
i
thinking
of
getting
married
married
married
and
leave
the
stage
my
god
it
is
a
sin
he
clutched
the
air
and
shook
handfuls
of
it
in
my
face
what
do
you
want
to
get
married
for
he
demanded
ai
you
getting
on
like
anything
ai
you
popular
ai
you
making
money
all
of
those
i
admitted
well
then
his
wrath
which
had
frothed
white
for
a
moment
cooled
down
into
a
fluid
sort
of
bewilderment
which
seemed
about
to
set
and
harden
in
a
smile
of
disbelief
the
man
i
am
going
to
marry
lives
in
mexico
mexico
mexico
he
bubbled
again
i
ask
you
is
that
any
sort
of
a
place
for
a
man
to
live
what
marries
the
greatest
tragic
actress
ever
was
going
to
be
ach
my
gott
in
moments
of
great
excitement
he
reverted
to
the
trick
of
the
tongue
to
which
he
was
born
all
these
years
i
have
waited
for
this
i
have
said
miss
lattimore
is
a
great
actress
she
has
talent
she
has
brains
and
when
she
will
have
passion
pouff
he
blew
out
his
loose
lips
and
made
a
balloon
with
his
hands
to
express
the
rate
at
which
i
would
rise
in
the
scale
of
tragic
actresses
and
now
that
it
has
happened
she
wants
to
live
in
mexico
he
deflated
himself
suddenly
folded
his
hands
over
what
he
believed
to
be
his
bosom
and
looked
at
me
reproachfully
this
being
the
first
time
he
had
studied
my
face
directly
since
i
came
home
i
suppose
he
must
have
seen
there
my
doubt
and
indecision
understand
me
he
said
soberly
i
have
known
a
lot
of
actresses
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
this
marrying
business
do
pay
they
got
to
come
back
to
the
stage
they
got
to
you
ai
going
to
be
any
different
down
there
in
mexico
to
what
you
are
in
new
york
understand
me
mexico
the
word
seemed
to
inflame
him
but
he
had
the
sense
to
let
me
alone
for
a
while
a
few
days
later
i
saw
in
the
paper
that
he
had
taken
the
lease
of
the
theatre
he
had
mentioned
to
me
and
i
knew
that
he
was
counting
on
my
going
to
mexico
i
suppose
if
i
had
had
the
courage
to
look
into
my
own
mind
to
find
out
what
i
wished
to
do
i
might
have
surmised
what
was
going
on
there
from
the
fact
that
i
did
mention
the
idea
of
marriage
to
sarah
i
have
tried
all
this
book
has
had
no
other
purpose
in
fact
than
to
try
to
tell
how
i
came
to
be
in
the
relation
i
was
to
helmeth
garrett
came
into
it
as
to
a
room
long
prepared
for
me
without
any
struggles
or
tormenting
and
without
thinking
much
about
the
effect
that
his
presence
in
my
life
would
have
upon
my
work
i
suppose
that
in
as
much
as
i
had
a
man
attitude
toward
work
i
had
come
unconsciously
to
the
man
habit
of
keeping
love
and
my
career
in
two
watertight
compartments
i
found
i
was
not
able
to
think
of
them
as
having
much
to
do
with
one
another
still
less
had
i
the
traditional
shames
of
my
situation
i
remember
the
first
time
i
went
to
rehearsal
groping
about
in
my
consciousness
for
the
source
of
what
i
felt
suddenly
divide
me
from
the
rest
of
my
company
and
finding
it
in
the
knowledge
of
myself
as
a
woman
acquainted
with
passion
with
a
secret
delicious
life
and
far
from
identifying
me
with
the
cheapness
and
betrayal
which
until
now
i
had
supposed
inseparable
from
the
uncertified
union
it
set
me
apart
in
the
aloofness
of
the
exclusive
the
distinguishing
experience
it
remained
for
sarah
to
pierce
me
in
spite
of
all
i
intrinsically
felt
my
relation
to
helmeth
garrett
to
be
with
the
knowledge
of
where
i
stood
in
the
world
which
i
still
believed
had
the
last
word
about
human
conduct
it
was
not
altogether
the
intent
to
deceive
that
kept
me
from
opening
the
matter
to
her
in
the
beginning
but
a
feeling
that
the
less
advice
i
had
about
it
the
better
and
if
i
did
tell
her
i
wished
first
to
arrange
that
i
need
not
feel
any
constraint
upon
me
of
our
habit
of
living
together
i
was
anxious
to
have
helmeth
find
me
when
he
came
free
to
be
all
to
him
that
our
love
demanded
and
in
view
of
all
the
years
in
which
sarah
and
i
had
lived
together
i
did
not
know
how
to
go
about
it
i
began
to
think
that
i
should
have
to
tell
her
after
all
when
the
powers
who
must
have
known
very
well
what
was
going
on
took
that
into
account
also
sarah
season
began
a
week
before
mine
and
i
remember
her
saying
that
she
would
be
glad
when
we
could
come
home
together
as
she
had
had
an
uneasy
sensation
for
the
last
night
or
two
of
some
one
following
her
sarah
had
any
number
of
admirers
but
the
sort
of
men
who
were
attracted
to
her
still
splendour
were
not
the
kind
to
follow
her
home
at
night
turn
them
over
to
the
police
i
suggested
i
had
had
to
try
that
once
or
twice
oh
i
could
she
turned
scarlet
even
after
all
those
years
i
had
not
realized
how
all
her
life
was
timed
to
catch
the
slightest
approaching
footfall
of
what
to
her
simple
faith
must
inevitably
come
i
found
her
waiting
for
me
at
the
stage
door
on
my
first
night
no
matter
how
many
of
them
you
have
first
nights
are
always
in
the
balance
and
we
were
so
taken
up
with
discussing
how
i
had
got
on
with
it
that
it
was
until
i
was
fitting
the
key
in
the
lock
that
i
was
recalled
to
the
occasion
of
her
annoyance
just
below
us
there
seemed
to
be
a
man
dodging
in
and
out
of
the
blocks
of
shadow
made
by
the
stairways
that
led
up
to
the
first
floor
of
the
row
of
flats
in
which
our
rooms
were
located
something
in
the
figure
or
in
our
standing
there
before
the
shadowed
door
with
the
dull
light
of
the
transom
over
us
brushed
me
with
a
light
wing
of
memory
i
seemed
to
recall
some
such
conjunction
before
but
it
was
gone
before
i
could
connote
the
suggestion
with
time
or
place
all
i
said
to
sarah
was
that
if
we
saw
anything
more
of
that
we
would
certainly
speak
to
the
police
the
next
night
we
went
to
supper
with
friends
and
it
was
after
midnight
when
my
cab
sarah
did
afford
cabs
for
herself
drew
up
at
the
door
the
approach
to
it
was
by
way
of
a
handsome
pair
of
stairs
with
an
ornamental
iron
railing
of
so
close
a
pattern
that
any
one
sitting
on
the
steps
in
the
dark
would
be
pretty
well
concealed
by
it
that
there
was
some
one
so
sitting
dropped
there
in
a
stupour
of
fatigue
or
drunkenness
we
did
not
discover
until
we
stumbled
fairly
on
to
him
the
exclamation
we
raised
awoke
him
it
arrested
the
attention
of
the
cab
driver
just
turning
from
the
curb
he
raised
his
lamp
and
sent
the
rays
of
it
streaming
over
us
the
man
i
could
see
was
shabby
ill
and
embarrassed
he
ducked
his
head
from
the
light
but
his
hat
had
fallen
off
on
the
step
and
as
he
threw
up
his
arm
to
protect
himself
from
recognition
i
knew
him
by
the
gesture
griff
i
cried
griffin
you
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
he
let
it
fall
at
his
side
and
stood
looking
at
us
pitifully
like
a
trapped
animal
i
was
doing
any
harm
he
mumbled
the
cab
driver
seeing
that
we
knew
him
let
down
his
lights
and
clattered
away
i
thought
quickly
he
must
have
been
in
want
he
had
looked
for
me
and
at
the
last
was
ashamed
to
claim
me
but
griffin
i
insisted
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
you
must
come
in
he
was
looking
at
me
he
had
heard
me
look
out
he
said
she
going
to
faint
he
brushed
past
me
to
sarah
she
leaned
limp
against
the
railing
he
steadied
her
as
a
man
might
a
sacred
vessel
in
jeopardy
but
sarah
did
faint
so
easily
as
that
she
gathered
herself
away
from
his
hand
come
upstairs
she
commanded
it
was
only
one
flight
up
i
do
know
how
we
managed
to
get
a
light
and
to
find
ourselves
in
its
pale
flare
confronting
one
another
i
could
see
then
that
my
first
surmise
had
been
correct
about
griffin
to
the
extent
that
he
looked
ill
and
in
want
he
was
holding
his
hat
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
stairs
and
fumbled
it
steadily
in
his
hands
his
hair
which
wanted
trimming
more
even
than
when
i
had
last
seen
him
had
still
its
romantic
curl
he
looked
steadily
out
from
under
it
at
sarah
i
had
an
idea
though
i
think
it
must
have
been
derived
from
my
own
dizziness
at
what
rushed
in
upon
me
that
sarah
was
floating
in
air
that
she
hung
there
swaying
with
the
breeze
from
the
open
window
as
a
spirit
she
was
spirit
white
and
her
voice
seemed
to
come
from
far
leon
leon
how
he
knew
what
she
demanded
of
him
only
the
god
who
makes
men
and
women
to
love
one
another
knows
she
died
he
said
to
the
unspoken
question
she
died
two
years
ago
i
been
all
this
time
finding
you
suddenly
a
quick
flame
burst
over
sarah
you
came
you
came
to
me
i
could
see
that
she
moved
toward
him
all
her
magnificent
body
alight
her
arms
her
bosom
i
turned
quickly
through
the
door
into
the
room
beyond
i
could
stay
to
see
that
i
went
on
into
my
bedroom
and
knelt
down
hiding
my
face
in
the
bedclothes
i
think
i
meant
to
pray
but
no
words
came
i
rose
presently
and
went
into
the
kitchen
the
maid
did
not
sleep
in
the
flat
but
came
every
morning
at
nine
on
the
table
there
was
a
tray
as
she
left
it
always
with
everything
laid
out
in
case
we
should
be
hungry
coming
late
from
the
theatre
i
moved
about
softly
and
made
chocolate
and
sandwiches
and
arranged
them
on
the
tray
i
knew
sarah
would
understand
about
half
an
hour
after
i
had
gone
to
my
room
again
i
heard
her
go
out
to
find
it
from
time
to
time
i
could
catch
a
faint
murmur
from
the
front
room
i
put
the
pillow
over
my
head
and
cried
softly
i
remembered
how
griffin
had
looked
at
her
that
time
in
chicago
when
i
had
taken
him
to
the
futurist
and
how
i
had
been
ashamed
ever
to
introduce
him
i
wondered
whether
his
real
name
were
lawrence
or
griffin
i
had
fallen
asleep
at
last
and
i
was
awakened
by
sarah
standing
beside
me
in
her
white
gown
may
i
sleep
with
you
olivia
i
put
lawrence
in
my
room
i
drew
her
under
the
cover
with
me
she
was
cold
and
now
and
then
a
shudder
passed
through
her
from
head
to
foot
you
guessed
did
you
she
whispered
he
said
you
knew
him
in
chicago
his
lawrence
is
dead
you
heard
him
say
that
i
understood
she
meant
by
that
to
extenuate
his
coming
back
to
her
it
was
right
for
him
to
come
if
no
other
woman
stood
in
the
way
what
there
was
in
himself
that
stood
in
the
way
did
seem
to
matter
he
been
ill
she
said
i
hope
you
did
mind
my
keeping
him
in
the
house
olive
we
can
be
married
i
sat
straight
up
in
bed
in
my
amazement
sarah
you
do
mean
that
you
are
going
to
marry
him
why
what
else
is
there
to
do
but
sarah
i
lay
down
again
after
all
what
else
was
there
to
do
you
know
olivia
you
have
never
really
loved
anybody
i
had
no
answer
to
that
suddenly
she
broke
out
shaking
the
bed
with
her
sobs
oh
my
dear
my
dear
it
is
true
that
he
loved
me
it
is
true
he
came
back
to
me
as
soon
as
he
was
free
oh
olive
if
you
had
known
what
it
is
all
these
years
not
to
know
if
it
was
if
he
had
only
taken
me
just
as
a
a
fancy
how
was
i
to
know
i
did
think
very
much
of
the
proof
that
he
loved
her
now
sarah
beautiful
prosperous
was
a
goal
for
any
man
to
strive
toward
even
without
the
necessity
which
was
written
in
every
line
of
leon
griffin
lawrence
sarah
i
questioned
gently
do
you
mean
to
say
you
loved
him
all
this
time
that
you
love
him
now
she
left
off
sobbing
to
answer
me
with
that
steady
patient
truth
with
which
she
met
any
issue
of
life
i
loved
him
all
the
love
i
had
i
gave
him
it
not
the
same
now
of
course
its
wings
are
broken
but
it
is
his
once
you
given
you
ca
take
it
back
again
but
he
he
has
no
claim
on
you
now
sarah
do
you
need
to
marry
him
i
am
married
to
him
but
sarah
look
here
sarah
it
is
true
that
i
have
never
loved
i
did
love
the
man
i
was
married
to
but
i
have
learned
something
about
love
i
learned
that
marriage
without
it
is
a
thing
no
woman
should
go
into
love
said
sarah
is
a
thing
that
once
you
gone
into
binds
you
by
something
that
grows
out
of
it
that
is
stronger
than
love
itself
olivia
i
am
bound
if
you
want
to
know
i
rather
be
bound
to
to
leon
lawrence
by
that
tie
than
to
the
dearest
love
without
it
oh
olivia
ca
you
see
ca
you
understand
that
i
have
to
do
that
the
way
i
see
things
there
a
law
not
a
civil
law
but
a
law
of
loving
that
goes
on
by
itself
and
being
faithful
to
it
is
better
to
me
than
loving
you
must
see
that
olivia
i
see
that
this
is
the
happiest
thing
for
you
and
i
not
put
anything
in
your
way
sarah
i
kissed
her
what
after
all
does
one
soul
know
of
another
it
came
to
me
as
an
extenuating
circumstance
when
i
looked
him
over
the
next
morning
that
lawrence
would
live
long
enough
to
do
her
any
particular
harm
he
had
been
so
little
of
a
man
always
to
me
so
much
less
so
now
eaten
through
as
he
was
by
poverty
and
sickness
that
i
could
never
understand
how
he
happened
to
be
the
vehicle
of
that
appealing
charm
which
even
as
i
looked
drew
me
over
to
his
side
in
something
like
a
sympathetic
frame
i
could
see
that
he
regarded
me
anxiously
and
i
thought
it
to
his
credit
to
be
able
to
realize
that
there
might
be
somebody
not
absolutely
delighted
at
his
marrying
sarah
but
it
was
as
i
learned
later
any
sense
of
his
shortcomings
that
waked
in
his
eye
toward
me
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
our
little
parlour
for
the
shock
of
the
encounter
had
been
too
much
for
the
abused
and
broken
thing
he
was
sarah
had
gone
out
to
consult
jerry
i
believed
about
their
marriage
she
would
have
asked
me
knowing
how
i
felt
about
it
griffin
looked
up
at
me
with
the
old
formless
demand
on
my
consideration
you
never
told
her
have
you
told
what
on
my
part
it
was
genuine
amazement
about
us
you
know
there
in
chicago
he
dropped
his
eyes
something
almost
like
a
blush
of
shame
overcame
him
i
stared
good
heavens
griff
i
forgotten
it
oh
well
i
did
know
some
women
he
stopped
embarrassed
by
my
sheer
credulity
of
its
having
anything
to
do
with
his
relation
to
sarah
i
told
you
i
was
a
bad
lot
he
protested
but
i
swear
that
since
my
wife
died
and
i
could
come
back
to
her
i
been
straight
you
believe
that
do
you
oh
i
believe
it
if
it
any
comfort
to
you
when
i
talked
it
over
with
jerry
afterward
i
could
see
the
queer
twisted
kind
of
moral
standard
by
which
he
made
it
appear
that
any
irregularity
of
his
during
his
wife
life
was
unfaithfulness
to
her
and
not
sarah
she
had
come
back
with
jerry
and
i
was
walking
with
him
to
the
city
hall
for
the
license
he
had
begun
by
protesting
just
as
i
had
and
had
surrendered
to
his
conviction
that
nothing
less
would
satisfy
sarah
after
all
i
said
it
shows
that
there
is
some
sort
of
harmony
between
them
that
he
should
realize
that
the
only
reparation
he
could
make
would
be
to
come
back
to
her
cur
jerry
kicked
at
the
pavement
to
pollute
the
life
of
a
woman
like
sarah
with
his
wretched
existence
that
how
you
feel
i
reminded
him
but
remember
how
all
these
years
sarah
has
felt
polluted
by
the
thought
that
she
was
married
to
him
oh
sarah
thinks
and
i
beginning
to
think
so
too
that
there
is
something
to
marriage
that
binds
besides
the
ceremony
i
know
jerry
wife
had
left
him
that
summer
and
though
he
knew
it
was
the
best
thing
for
both
of
them
he
was
trying
to
get
her
back
again
it
binds
of
itself
if
only
they
would
tell
us
that
in
the
beginning
instead
of
putting
up
all
this
stuff
about
its
being
the
law
and
religion
we
think
we
can
get
out
of
it
just
by
getting
out
of
the
law
and
none
of
us
know
better
until
it
is
too
late
people
like
sarah
know
they
know
just
the
way
swallows
know
to
go
south
in
winter
you
see
she
will
be
happier
married
not
because
it
is
pleasant
but
because
it
is
right
they
were
married
that
afternoon
in
our
apartment
and
it
was
not
until
i
was
settled
in
the
hotel
where
i
had
elected
to
stay
until
i
could
find
suitable
quarters
that
i
realized
that
the
chance
of
this
marriage
had
accomplished
for
me
the
freedom
that
i
had
not
known
how
to
obtain
for
myself
i
lay
awake
a
long
time
after
i
came
from
the
theatre
and
the
mere
circumstance
of
my
being
alone
and
in
a
hotel
as
well
as
the
events
that
led
up
to
it
brought
back
to
me
the
sense
of
my
lover
of
his
being
just
in
the
next
room
and
presently
to
come
in
to
me
i
felt
near
and
warm
toward
him
and
then
i
thought
of
sarah
and
griffin
and
how
almost
i
had
become
the
to
his
affections
that
she
dreaded
most
to
find
herself
to
have
been
it
did
seem
very
real
in
retrospect
i
shuddered
away
from
it
then
i
began
to
think
how
i
had
first
been
kindly
disposed
toward
him
and
that
brought
up
an
image
of
the
dim
corridor
of
the
hotel
where
i
had
come
to
my
first
knowledge
of
such
relations
and
my
abhorrence
and
terror
of
it
i
thought
of
and
of
miss
dean
and
that
suspicion
of
sickliness
which
her
personality
had
for
me
and
saw
how
it
must
have
arisen
from
her
consciousness
of
what
she
had
done
to
griffin
rather
than
her
relation
to
manager
then
i
thought
of
helmeth
garrett
and
one
night
in
sienna
when
the
moonlight
poured
white
over
the
cathedral
and
a
linden
tree
in
bloom
outside
the
window
and
a
nightingale
singing
in
it
suddenly
it
was
mixed
up
in
my
mind
with
the
slanting
chandelier
and
the
clock
and
slowly
a
sense
of
unutterable
stain
and
shame
began
to
percolate
through
and
through
me
chapter
vi
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
assertiveness
is
the
only
mannish
trait
taken
on
by
successful
women
nor
is
pliability
the
only
feminine
mark
they
lose
by
what
insensible
degrees
it
came
about
i
do
not
know
but
i
found
myself
on
the
peak
of
popularity
very
much
of
the
male
propensity
to
be
beguiled
i
was
willing
to
be
played
upon
and
so
it
was
skilfully
done
to
concede
to
it
more
than
the
situation
had
a
right
to
claim
for
itself
i
pulled
myself
up
afterward
or
was
pulled
up
by
the
sharp
rein
of
destiny
but
for
the
time
while
my
success
was
new
i
was
aware
not
only
of
the
possibility
of
my
being
handled
but
of
my
luxuriating
in
it
of
demanding
it
as
the
price
of
my
favour
and
in
particular
of
valuing
polatkin
for
the
way
in
which
by
my
own
moods
my
drops
and
exaltations
he
brought
me
to
his
hand
how
much
of
the
fact
of
my
private
life
he
was
really
acquainted
with
i
never
knew
but
he
understood
enough
of
its
reaction
to
make
even
my
resistences
serve
to
push
me
on
to
the
assured
position
of
a
theatre
and
a
clientele
of
my
own
it
stood
out
for
me
as
he
described
it
not
so
much
as
a
means
of
dividing
me
from
my
beloved
but
as
a
new
and
completer
way
of
loving
i
wanted
more
ways
for
that
space
and
opportunity
i
wished
to
lay
my
gift
down
a
royal
carpet
for
helmeth
garrett
to
walk
on
i
would
have
done
anything
for
him
with
it
except
surrender
it
not
the
least
thing
that
came
of
my
condition
was
the
extraordinary
florescence
of
my
art
every
night
as
i
drew
its
rich
and
shining
fabric
about
me
i
was
aware
of
all
forms
and
passions
the
mere
masquerade
of
our
delight
in
one
another
every
night
i
embroidered
it
anew
i
adored
and
caressed
him
with
my
skill
polatkin
went
about
wringing
his
hands
over
it
you
are
a
wonder
a
wonder
and
you
are
wasting
it
on
them
swine
that
was
his
opinion
of
my
support
and
to
think
you
could
have
a
theatre
of
your
own
and
what
you
like
a
theatre
like
me
spread
over
it
expressed
exemplified
carried
out
to
the
least
detail
you
shall
have
it
even
in
the
box
office
he
responded
magnificently
how
soon
i
will
bring
the
plans
this
afternoon
i
got
ready
in
case
you
came
around
but
he
was
much
too
intelligent
to
undertake
to
bind
me
to
them
at
that
juncture
things
went
on
like
this
until
the
last
week
in
november
then
i
had
a
telegram
from
helmeth
saying
that
he
would
be
detained
still
longer
every
pulse
of
me
had
so
been
set
to
his
coming
on
the
that
i
thought
i
should
not
be
able
to
go
on
after
that
i
should
go
out
like
a
light
when
the
current
is
stopped
i
had
so
little
of
him
not
even
a
photograph
nothing
but
my
ring
and
a
few
trinkets
he
had
bought
me
in
italy
if
i
could
have
had
a
garment
he
had
worn
a
chair
in
which
he
had
sat
i
went
round
and
looked
at
the
astor
house
because
he
told
me
that
he
had
stopped
there
once
years
ago
i
stood
that
for
three
days
and
then
i
went
down
to
new
rochelle
where
he
had
written
me
earlier
his
girls
were
at
school
not
on
my
own
account
you
understand
but
as
a
possible
patron
of
the
school
on
behalf
of
my
niece
who
was
if
the
truth
must
be
told
less
than
two
years
old
while
i
was
being
shown
about
i
had
helmeth
children
pointed
out
to
me
they
looked
as
i
had
surmised
like
their
mother
if
they
had
in
the
least
resembled
their
father
i
should
have
snatched
them
to
me
everything
might
have
turned
out
quite
differently
they
were
the
principal
said
nice
girls
and
studious
but
they
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
their
father
it
was
one
of
those
dark
gusty
days
that
come
at
the
end
of
november
damp
without
rain
and
of
a
penetrating
cold
there
had
been
a
great
storm
at
sea
lately
and
you
could
hear
the
wash
of
its
disturbances
all
along
the
sound
there
was
no
steady
wind
but
now
and
then
the
damp
air
gave
a
flap
like
an
idle
wing
it
was
like
the
stir
in
me
of
a
formless
cold
desire
not
equal
to
the
demand
life
was
about
to
make
on
it
as
i
turned
into
the
station
road
after
a
formal
inspection
of
the
premises
i
met
the
girls
coming
back
from
their
afternoon
walk
with
the
teachers
two
and
two
the
garrett
girls
were
next
to
the
last
they
were
very
near
of
an
age
i
waited
half
hidden
by
a
tree
to
watch
them
as
they
passed
they
were
well
covered
up
from
the
weather
in
large
blue
coats
with
capes
and
blue
felt
hats
with
butterfly
bows
to
match
at
the
ends
of
their
flaxen
braids
they
looked
like
their
mother
i
could
see
them
growing
up
to
anything
that
would
fit
with
sarah
and
jerry
and
polatkin
the
wing
of
the
wind
shook
out
some
gathered
drops
of
moisture
as
they
passed
the
branches
of
the
trees
clashed
softly
together
and
as
they
turned
into
the
grounds
i
noticed
that
the
older
one
had
something
in
her
walk
that
reminded
me
of
her
father
i
was
pierced
through
with
a
formless
jealousy
of
the
woman
who
had
borne
them
in
her
body
i
was
moved
but
not
with
the
impulse
to
draw
them
to
my
bosom
i
felt
back
in
the
place
where
my
boy
had
been
for
the
connecting
link
of
motherliness
and
failed
to
find
it
i
had
had
it
once
that
knowledge
of
what
is
good
to
be
done
for
small
children
and
the
wish
to
do
it
but
it
was
gone
from
me
it
was
as
though
i
might
have
had
a
hand
or
a
claw
any
prehensile
organ
by
which
such
things
are
apprehended
and
when
i
reached
it
out
after
helmeth
children
it
was
withered
what
i
found
in
myself
was
the
familiar
attitude
of
the
stage
i
could
have
acted
what
swept
through
me
then
i
could
have
brought
you
to
tears
by
it
but
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
about
it
act
i
wrote
helmeth
that
night
that
i
had
seen
the
children
and
then
i
burned
the
letter
he
came
at
last
he
was
greatly
concerned
about
his
enterprise
which
was
not
yet
established
on
that
footing
which
he
would
like
to
have
for
it
and
i
think
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
have
me
without
the
conventions
and
readjustments
of
marriage
it
was
tacitly
understood
between
us
that
things
were
better
as
they
were
until
that
business
was
settled
i
think
he
could
not
have
had
a
great
deal
of
money
at
the
time
all
that
racing
to
and
fro
between
london
and
mexico
must
have
cost
something
his
anxiety
about
the
girls
which
occasioned
his
sending
them
to
the
most
expensive
schools
and
his
affection
for
them
which
led
to
their
being
carted
about
by
their
aunt
to
meet
him
occasionally
at
places
was
an
additional
drain
we
were
very
happy
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
tell
about
it
we
met
in
brief
intervals
snatched
from
our
work
and
did
as
other
lovers
do
sometimes
he
would
come
for
me
at
the
theatre
the
freshness
of
my
acting
never
palled
on
him
other
times
i
would
find
him
waiting
for
me
in
the
little
flat
i
had
expressly
chosen
and
furnished
to
be
loved
in
the
pricking
warmth
of
his
presence
would
meet
me
as
i
came
up
the
stair
not
long
ago
i
found
myself
unexpectedly
in
a
part
of
the
city
where
we
used
to
walk
because
we
were
certain
not
to
meet
any
of
our
friends
there
there
was
a
tiny
café
where
we
used
often
to
dine
and
the
memory
of
it
swept
over
me
terrifyingly
fresh
and
strong
with
all
this
it
was
plain
that
we
got
on
best
when
we
were
most
alone
it
was
not
that
i
did
not
every
way
like
and
was
interested
in
the
friends
he
introduced
to
me
outdoor
men
most
of
them
and
their
capable
wives
i
got
on
with
them
tremendously
and
found
them
as
good
for
me
as
green
food
in
the
spring
sated
as
i
was
on
the
combined
product
of
professionalism
and
temperament
it
was
chiefly
that
the
simplicity
and
openness
of
their
lives
brought
out
for
him
the
duplicity
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
ours
for
it
was
plain
that
they
would
have
understood
would
have
thought
it
necessary
they
could
have
faced
those
women
strange
lands
and
untoward
happenings
had
many
of
them
faced
sterner
things
for
the
sake
of
their
husbands
with
the
same
courage
and
selflessness
with
which
they
would
in
my
circumstances
have
faced
renunciation
it
was
the
realization
of
this
so
much
sharper
in
him
who
had
seen
and
known
that
checked
and
harassed
helmeth
he
wished
to
be
at
one
with
them
to
be
felicitated
on
my
success
and
my
charm
to
include
me
if
only
by
implication
in
that
community
of
adventure
with
which
these
mining
and
engineering
folk
had
ringed
the
earth
and
the
necessity
of
holding
our
relation
down
to
the
outward
forms
of
friendship
established
on
the
supposition
of
our
having
grown
up
together
fretted
him
it
is
honest
he
broke
out
once
after
he
had
tried
to
persuade
me
to
let
him
tell
his
friends
that
we
were
engaged
it
all
right
between
us
you
are
my
wife
in
the
sight
of
whatever
gods
there
are
but
that
is
what
other
people
would
call
you
somehow
helmeth
so
long
as
it
is
with
you
i
do
care
much
what
they
call
me
well
i
care
i
care
a
lot
you
do
seem
to
remember
you
are
going
to
be
my
girls
mother
sons
too
i
hope
we
ought
to
have
some
more
children
sanderson
got
four
sanderson
had
been
our
host
at
luncheon
that
day
helmeth
was
knocking
out
the
ashes
of
his
pipe
on
my
hearthstone
he
paused
in
the
occupation
of
refilling
it
to
look
down
at
me
in
a
moody
kind
of
impatience
that
was
the
worst
i
knew
of
him
there
was
the
suggestion
of
a
cleft
in
his
strong
square
chin
which
came
out
whenever
he
bit
hard
on
a
difficult
proposition
the
play
of
it
now
was
like
the
tiny
shadow
of
disaster
i
was
down
in
old
brownlow
office
the
other
day
he
went
on
talking
this
mexican
scheme
to
him
and
he
had
to
break
off
in
the
middle
of
it
to
telephone
to
some
chorus
girl
he
had
a
date
with
god
it
made
me
hot
to
think
of
it
because
i
in
the
same
he
cut
me
off
with
a
sound
of
vexation
do
say
it
do
even
think
of
it
how
long
does
this
contract
of
yours
last
to
the
end
of
the
season
i
told
him
well
you
chuck
it
just
as
soon
as
you
can
i
put
this
thing
through
somehow
we
clear
out
of
here
he
had
his
pipe
alight
by
now
and
began
puffing
more
contentedly
i
do
think
much
of
this
burg
anyway
he
laughed
as
he
settled
himself
in
one
of
my
chairs
a
man
does
have
a
chance
to
get
his
feet
on
the
ground
there
were
times
when
he
almost
made
me
share
in
his
distaste
for
it
that
was
when
i
had
drawn
him
into
the
circle
of
my
professional
acquaintances
which
somehow
shrivelled
at
his
touch
like
spiders
in
the
heat
understand
that
i
hold
by
my
art
that
i
have
poured
myself
a
libation
on
that
altar
that
i
value
it
above
all
other
means
of
expressing
the
drama
of
man
relation
to
the
invisible
and
that
i
do
not
think
you
do
enough
for
it
prize
it
enough
or
use
it
rightly
but
i
suppose
there
is
a
yellow
streak
in
me
or
i
would
sicken
so
as
i
do
at
what
it
brings
to
pass
in
the
personalities
by
which
it
is
most
forwarded
for
since
it
must
be
that
art
can
not
be
served
to
the
world
except
by
a
cup
emptied
of
much
that
is
most
desirable
in
the
recipients
it
ill
becomes
them
as
long
as
they
fatten
their
souls
at
it
to
take
exception
to
the
vessel
from
which
it
is
drunk
nevertheless
i
used
to
find
myself
when
helmeth
was
with
me
sniffing
at
the
spiritual
garments
of
my
friends
for
the
smell
of
burning
i
resented
lawrence
the
most
it
was
not
altogether
for
the
incongruity
of
his
possessing
sarah
her
fine
smudgeless
personality
and
her
lovely
body
delicate
and
shapely
as
a
pearl
but
for
the
incontestable
evidence
he
offered
me
of
how
low
i
had
stooped
from
the
peak
of
my
present
prosperity
my
troubles
in
chicago
showed
the
merest
accident
and
the
distance
i
had
sprung
away
from
them
seemed
somehow
expressive
of
the
strength
with
which
i
had
sprung
from
all
that
lawrence
represented
not
all
the
care
sarah
bestowed
on
him
and
i
think
the
best
he
could
do
for
her
was
to
provide
her
in
his
impaired
health
with
an
occasion
for
mothering
could
quite
distract
the
attention
from
the
ineradicable
mark
of
his
cheapness
he
was
as
much
out
of
key
with
the
society
in
which
sarah
success
and
mine
had
placed
him
as
he
was
flattered
to
find
himself
there
it
had
brought
out
in
him
in
the
way
privation
had
not
that
touch
of
theatricality
which
intrigued
sarah
unsophisticated
fancy
in
the
first
place
he
let
his
hair
grow
into
curls
and
made
a
mysterious
and
incurable
pain
of
his
broken
health
and
though
he
offered
it
as
the
best
he
had
to
offer
with
humility
he
suffered
an
accession
of
that
devoted
manner
which
had
won
his
way
among
women
of
his
own
class
but
which
among
the
sort
he
met
at
my
rooms
was
ridiculous
jerry
too
with
his
married
life
in
dissolution
for
what
looked
to
helmeth
and
in
the
light
of
his
strong
sense
was
beginning
to
look
to
me
like
an
aimless
folly
out
of
all
these
blew
a
wind
witheringly
on
the
fine
bloom
of
my
happiness
we
did
best
when
we
shut
it
out
in
a
profound
exalted
intimacy
of
passion
what
leads
me
to
think
that
polatkin
must
have
watched
me
rather
closely
all
this
time
is
the
fact
that
he
waited
until
garrett
was
gone
to
london
again
in
the
latter
part
of
february
to
put
it
to
me
that
if
i
really
meant
to
leave
the
stage
permanently
and
it
was
a
contingency
which
in
speaking
to
me
of
it
he
had
the
wit
to
speak
seriously
i
could
do
no
better
for
myself
than
to
take
flight
from
it
from
the
roof
of
my
own
theatre
he
put
it
to
me
in
his
own
dialect
mixed
of
the
green
room
and
jewry
that
i
had
torn
a
large
hole
in
the
surrounding
professional
atmosphere
by
the
vitality
of
my
acting
that
winter
and
that
it
would
be
a
great
shame
to
go
out
into
the
obscurity
of
marriage
without
this
final
pyrotechnic
burst
i
could
have
by
his
calculation
a
short
season
to
open
with
and
a
whole
year
of
brilliant
success
before
well
before
anything
happened
i
think
by
this
time
i
must
have
known
subconsciously
that
nothing
would
happen
it
must
be
because
no
man
naturally
can
imagine
any
more
compelling
business
for
a
woman
than
being
interested
in
him
that
helmeth
failed
to
understand
that
he
could
as
well
have
torn
himself
from
the
enterprise
for
which
he
had
starved
and
sweated
as
separate
me
from
the
final
banquet
of
success
i
had
paid
for
it
and
i
must
eat
we
opened
in
may
not
the
best
time
of
year
for
such
an
adventure
but
i
suppose
polatkin
was
afraid
to
trust
me
to
the
distractions
of
another
vacation
it
occurs
to
me
now
though
at
the
time
i
did
suspect
him
that
we
could
have
opened
even
then
if
he
had
not
been
much
more
forward
with
the
plan
than
at
any
time
he
had
permitted
me
to
guess
at
the
last
i
came
near
in
his
estimation
to
jeopardizing
the
whole
business
by
opening
with
the
winter
tale
with
sarah
in
the
part
of
and
myself
as
jerry
was
writing
me
a
new
play
but
in
the
process
of
breaking
off
a
marriage
that
ought
never
to
have
been
begun
he
had
found
no
time
to
complete
it
but
why
urged
polatkin
if
we
must
fall
back
on
shakespeare
choose
a
part
that
did
not
introduce
me
to
the
audience
until
the
play
was
half
done
he
stood
out
at
least
for
or
why
indeed
i
retorted
have
a
theatre
of
my
own
if
it
is
not
to
do
as
i
please
in
it
i
knew
however
that
what
i
could
put
into
of
willesden
lake
and
the
woods
aflame
would
have
sustained
even
a
more
inconsiderable
part
effie
and
her
husband
came
on
to
my
opening
night
i
want
to
say
here
if
i
have
not
explicitly
said
it
that
my
sister
is
a
wonderful
an
indispensable
woman
when
i
think
of
her
the
mystery
of
how
she
came
out
of
taylorville
to
her
time
is
greater
than
the
mystery
of
how
i
came
to
be
at
all
for
effie
is
absolutely
contemporaneous
she
lives
squarely
not
only
in
her
century
but
in
the
particular
quarter
of
it
now
going
no
clutch
of
tradition
topples
her
toward
the
generation
of
women
past
most
women
of
my
acquaintance
are
either
sodden
with
conventions
or
blowsy
with
racing
after
the
but
effie
is
compacted
tucked
in
detached
from
but
distinctly
related
to
her
background
of
montecito
she
was
president
of
the
woman
club
chairman
of
the
book
committee
of
the
circulating
library
and
though
she
had
a
letter
every
morning
and
a
telegram
every
night
from
the
woman
with
whom
she
had
left
her
two
babies
it
prevent
her
in
the
week
she
spent
with
me
from
getting
into
touch
with
more
forward
movements
than
i
was
aware
were
in
operation
in
new
york
but
good
heavens
effie
how
can
you
find
time
for
them
it
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
attend
to
my
own
job
oh
you
you
a
forward
movement
yourself
all
i
am
doing
is
herding
the
others
up
to
keep
step
with
you
you
know
olivia
i
wondered
if
you
did
feel
lonely
at
times
so
far
ahead
that
you
do
find
anybody
to
line
up
every
time
i
see
a
woman
step
out
of
the
ranks
in
some
achievement
of
her
own
i
think
olivia
will
have
company
but
heavens
i
said
again
i
not
thinking
of
the
others
at
all
i
do
even
know
that
there
are
others
or
at
least
who
they
are
i
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
i
go
round
because
i
must
i
do
know
what
comes
of
it
i
tell
you
what
comes
women
everywhere
getting
courage
to
live
lives
of
their
own
do
you
remember
what
you
went
through
in
higgleston
well
the
more
women
there
are
like
you
the
less
there
will
be
of
that
for
any
of
them
it
is
the
conscious
movement
of
us
all
toward
liberty
that
going
round
with
you
i
was
dashed
by
the
breadth
and
brightness
of
her
view
effie
i
said
is
this
a
new
kind
of
toy
to
dangle
before
your
intelligence
to
keep
it
from
realizing
it
is
getting
anywhere
like
the
love
affairs
of
your
friends
she
came
back
at
me
promptly
no
it
is
it
well
i
guess
it
a
religion
i
believed
as
i
dressed
at
the
theatre
that
night
that
it
was
the
contagion
of
effie
enthusiasm
that
keyed
me
up
to
a
pitch
that
i
thought
i
should
have
reached
without
helmeth
i
had
counted
so
on
his
being
there
for
the
first
night
but
he
was
still
in
london
and
for
a
week
i
had
heard
from
him
i
needed
something
then
to
account
as
i
proceeded
with
my
part
for
the
extraordinary
richness
of
power
the
delicacy
and
precision
with
which
i
put
it
over
line
by
line
to
my
audience
i
played
oh
i
played
i
felt
the
audience
breathing
in
the
pauses
like
the
silent
wood
the
lights
went
gold
and
crimson
and
the
young
dreams
were
singing
so
vivid
was
the
mood
that
when
from
time
to
time
i
was
swept
out
on
billows
of
applause
before
the
curtain
i
fancied
i
saw
him
there
leaning
to
me
now
from
a
balcony
or
standing
unobserved
in
a
box
behind
the
sandersons
and
some
friends
of
his
who
had
pleased
on
his
introduction
to
take
a
great
interest
in
me
it
was
a
wonderful
night
flooded
with
the
certainty
of
success
as
by
a
full
moon
we
danced
under
it
in
spirit
i
believe
that
polatkin
kissed
me
two
of
my
young
men
i
saw
with
their
hands
on
one
another
shoulders
capering
in
the
wings
as
i
was
being
drawn
before
the
curtain
again
and
again
to
bob
and
smile
like
a
cuckoo
out
of
a
clock
striking
the
perfect
hour
and
through
it
all
was
the
sense
of
my
beloved
the
touch
of
his
kiss
on
my
cheek
the
pressure
of
his
arm
so
poignant
that
as
i
came
out
of
the
theatre
late
with
effie
and
her
husband
i
thought
i
could
not
bear
it
to
go
back
to
my
room
and
find
it
empty
willis
i
said
to
my
you
must
lend
me
my
sister
i
was
sitting
between
them
in
the
carriage
each
of
them
holding
a
hand
i
do
not
know
what
they
were
able
to
get
of
my
acting
but
nothing
could
have
kept
from
them
the
knowledge
of
my
tremendous
success
i
could
see
though
that
in
his
excited
state
it
was
going
to
be
easy
for
him
to
spare
his
young
wife
and
that
made
it
easier
for
me
as
we
drew
up
in
front
of
my
door
to
change
my
mind
suddenly
and
send
her
back
with
him
what
really
influenced
me
was
the
certainty
that
i
could
not
bear
even
for
effie
to
disturb
the
sense
of
my
presence
which
i
seemed
to
feel
brooding
over
the
room
i
went
up
the
steps
warm
with
it
i
had
a
moment
of
thinking
as
i
opened
the
door
and
found
the
lights
turned
on
that
my
maid
had
left
them
so
in
anticipation
of
my
return
and
then
i
saw
him
he
was
sitting
by
the
dying
fire
he
had
not
heard
me
come
up
the
stair
for
his
head
was
in
his
hands
he
turned
then
at
my
exclamation
and
i
had
time
before
we
crossed
the
width
of
the
room
to
one
another
to
think
that
the
attitude
in
which
i
had
found
him
and
the
new
writing
of
anxiety
in
his
face
as
he
turned
it
to
me
had
its
source
in
his
finding
me
in
what
looked
like
a
permanent
relation
to
a
theatre
of
my
own
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
and
then
my
apprehension
was
buried
on
his
breast
oh
my
love
my
love
he
held
me
off
from
him
to
let
his
eyes
rove
tenderly
over
my
face
my
breast
my
hair
i
do
not
know
if
he
remembered
the
words
he
had
spoken
to
me
so
long
ago
or
if
they
came
spontaneously
to
the
command
of
the
old
desire
oh
you
beauty
you
wonder
presently
we
moved
to
sit
down
and
stumbled
over
his
bag
upon
the
floor
beside
his
chair
it
brought
me
back
to
the
miracle
of
his
being
there
and
to
the
certainty
that
he
must
have
come
to
me
direct
from
the
steamer
on
the
he
admitted
six
days
and
a
half
o
lord
his
gesture
was
expressive
of
the
extreme
weariness
of
impatience
i
came
ashore
with
the
quarantine
officers
i
could
cable
i
left
at
two
hours
notice
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
must
have
at
least
come
ashore
before
sunset
and
in
that
case
he
could
have
come
straight
to
me
i
began
to
feel
something
ominous
in
the
presence
there
of
his
bag
his
overcoat
though
the
evening
was
so
warm
lay
beyond
him
on
another
chair
it
flashed
over
me
in
a
wild
way
that
he
had
come
to
some
sudden
determination
he
had
been
at
the
theatre
that
night
he
had
taken
my
being
there
in
that
circumstance
as
final
perhaps
he
meant
to
abandon
me
to
my
art
to
surrender
me
at
least
to
its
more
importunate
claim
he
followed
my
thought
dully
from
far
off
i
was
at
the
theatre
in
time
for
your
part
he
said
there
was
a
seat
but
they
knew
me
at
the
box
office
and
let
me
in
then
it
you
that
i
saw
in
the
balcony
and
in
sanderson
box
i
thought
it
was
a
vision
i
had
business
with
sanderson
he
turned
back
to
what
was
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
through
his
profound
preoccupation
the
charm
of
my
presence
there
was
that
in
your
acting
that
would
have
evoked
visions
he
smiled
i
had
them
myself
i
knelt
down
on
the
floor
beside
his
knees
helmeth
tell
me
i
begged
he
began
to
stroke
my
face
with
his
hand
it
does
seem
so
bad
as
it
did
a
few
moments
ago
and
yet
it
is
bad
enough
i
must
leave
for
mexico
in
an
hour
leave
me
i
was
still
in
my
mind
occupied
with
what
now
began
to
seem
a
monstrous
disloyalty
to
him
my
obligation
to
polatkin
there
had
been
a
great
deal
about
our
new
venture
on
the
programme
even
if
he
had
seen
the
papers
he
must
have
learned
it
as
soon
as
he
came
into
the
theatre
unless
you
can
go
with
me
in
an
hour
yes
my
dear
i
know
it
is
impossible
he
was
silent
a
while
clasping
and
unclasping
my
hand
on
his
knee
knitting
his
brows
and
staring
into
the
fire
with
the
expression
of
a
man
so
long
occupied
with
anxiety
that
his
mind
in
any
moment
of
release
goes
back
to
it
automatically
i
stirred
presently
when
i
saw
that
his
perplexity
had
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
had
a
cable
in
london
he
said
heaven
only
knows
how
long
they
were
getting
it
down
to
the
coast
where
they
could
send
it
they
have
struck
water
in
the
mines
i
failed
to
get
the
force
of
the
announcement
except
that
from
the
manner
of
his
telling
it
it
was
a
great
disaster
i
must
leave
on
the
twelve
he
warned
me
i
did
understand
that
oh
no
helmeth
i
cried
out
not
now
not
so
soon
i
clung
to
him
crying
stay
with
me
just
for
we
rocked
in
one
another
arms
i
remember
little
broken
snatches
of
explanation
i
worked
olivia
i
worked
and
sweated
and
now
presently
he
broke
out
again
to
have
worked
and
know
that
your
work
is
sound
and
to
be
played
a
trick
to
lose
by
a
ghastly
trick
if
there
is
a
god
olivia
why
does
he
play
tricks
on
a
man
like
that
hush
my
dear
oh
my
dear
do
you
know
what
i
been
doing
since
i
came
ashore
i
been
buying
pumps
olivia
pumps
and
machinery
to
work
them
think
of
the
delay
and
i
have
to
ask
shane
for
more
money
more
and
i
meant
to
be
paying
dividends
he
held
me
off
from
him
fiercely
with
both
hands
olivia
suppose
instead
of
applause
you
had
heard
hisses
and
people
going
out
turning
their
backs
on
you
in
your
best
lines
oh
he
broke
off
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
crept
up
to
him
if
they
had
i
should
have
come
back
to
you
beloved
and
i
have
remembered
it
oh
beloved
what
are
all
things
worth
except
that
they
give
us
this
i
was
on
his
knee
now
and
my
hair
was
still
in
its
maiden
snood
as
it
had
been
in
the
play
i
drew
it
softly
about
his
face
oh
my
dear
to
be
to
me
what
does
it
matter
about
the
mines
they
will
come
straight
again
in
a
little
time
but
this
this
is
i
could
feel
the
yielding
in
his
frame
he
was
my
man
and
i
did
what
i
would
with
him
chapter
vii
among
all
the
devices
with
which
we
confound
the
powers
forever
fumbling
at
our
lives
none
must
puzzle
them
more
than
the
set
of
obligations
and
interactions
that
go
by
the
name
of
business
unless
indeed
there
is
a
god
of
business
which
i
doubt
past
all
misguiding
of
our
youth
past
all
time
and
distance
and
unlikelihood
the
god
who
would
be
worshipped
most
by
the
welding
of
spirit
into
spirit
had
brought
us
two
together
only
to
be
rived
apart
by
the
necessity
which
tied
us
each
not
only
to
our
own
but
to
other
people
means
of
making
a
living
the
two
or
three
hours
following
on
helmeth
announcement
of
the
accident
which
had
who
knows
but
at
the
instance
of
the
powers
which
was
bent
upon
uniting
us
shattered
the
point
of
his
attachment
to
the
mexican
scheme
we
spent
in
that
drowning
realization
of
the
source
of
being
and
delight
for
each
in
the
other
which
is
the
process
and
the
end
of
loving
and
then
the
withdrawing
of
whole
electric
constellations
from
the
city
skyline
and
the
clatter
of
the
morning
traffic
in
the
street
and
the
dispersing
blueness
let
in
with
them
the
considerations
which
whipped
us
apart
if
there
is
a
god
of
business
he
is
of
a
superior
subtlety
for
even
then
we
proposed
to
one
another
that
the
best
way
of
being
quit
of
the
obligation
was
to
serve
our
time
to
it
and
it
was
in
pursuance
of
some
such
idea
that
i
found
myself
toward
the
latter
part
of
june
going
out
to
los
angeles
to
meet
garrett
who
would
by
that
time
have
come
up
the
coast
from
mazatplan
to
make
purchases
of
supplies
i
should
have
gone
much
farther
than
that
merely
to
have
touch
with
him
the
warm
pressure
of
his
hand
his
voice
at
my
ear
all
my
dreams
even
were
tinged
by
the
loss
out
of
my
life
of
his
bodily
presence
it
was
a
singular
circumstance
that
the
assured
success
of
my
new
venture
set
up
in
me
a
fiercer
need
there
had
not
been
time
for
much
in
his
letters
but
accounts
of
his
struggle
with
conditions
at
the
mine
and
his
slow
conquest
of
the
water
that
flooded
all
the
lower
levels
of
disheartening
incompetent
labour
and
the
multiplied
difficulty
of
distance
from
any
base
of
supplies
but
that
little
was
all
timed
to
our
meeting
again
i
will
explain
all
that
when
i
see
you
we
will
talk
of
that
later
were
phrases
that
cropped
out
in
his
letters
many
times
i
did
not
know
even
in
the
act
of
going
there
just
what
he
expected
to
bring
to
pass
in
our
affairs
by
my
being
in
los
angeles
i
only
know
that
i
wanted
desperately
to
see
him
one
thing
i
gathered
from
his
letters
that
in
the
preoccupation
and
haste
of
his
stay
in
new
york
he
had
wholly
missed
the
significance
of
my
new
entanglement
with
morris
polatkin
i
have
to
suppose
to
account
for
his
never
having
any
other
conception
of
what
my
work
was
to
me
that
he
had
never
known
a
professional
woman
or
one
who
worked
at
anything
except
as
a
between
the
inconsequence
of
youth
and
marriage
he
felt
himself
humbly
rather
a
poor
substitute
for
the
colour
the
excitement
and
gayety
of
my
career
why
should
so
many
people
suppose
that
an
actress
life
is
gay
but
he
balanced
that
with
what
he
meant
to
purchase
for
me
by
his
own
achievement
he
had
without
thinking
it
necessary
to
account
for
it
the
idea
that
is
so
generally
and
unexcusedly
entertained
that
i
am
sometimes
hypnotized
into
thinking
it
must
be
the
right
one
that
a
woman
in
becoming
a
man
wife
ceases
to
be
her
own
and
becomes
somehow
mysteriously
and
inevitably
his
it
was
not
that
in
all
our
talk
about
it
he
had
any
conclusions
about
the
stage
as
an
unsuitable
profession
for
women
but
that
he
was
inherently
unable
to
think
of
it
as
possible
for
his
wife
we
were
saved
from
dispute
by
the
proof
i
had
had
in
italy
that
his
inability
to
think
of
me
as
having
a
life
apart
arose
chiefly
in
his
need
of
me
which
had
in
it
something
of
the
absolute
quality
of
a
child
need
of
its
mother
i
am
glad
now
in
view
of
all
that
came
of
it
that
i
was
spared
the
bitterness
of
not
seeing
in
his
inability
to
accept
the
finality
of
my
relation
to
my
work
anything
nobler
than
an
insufferable
male
egotism
i
have
thought
since
that
we
might
have
made
more
of
our
love
if
we
had
but
seen
somewhere
in
the
world
the
process
of
its
being
so
made
if
we
could
have
moved
for
a
time
in
a
footing
of
intimacy
among
other
pairs
who
had
produced
out
of
as
unlikely
material
a
competent
and
satisfying
frame
of
life
we
did
not
know
any
but
theatrical
people
among
whom
the
wife
had
interests
apart
from
her
husband
that
is
where
taylorville
betrayed
us
and
now
you
know
what
i
meant
when
i
said
in
the
beginning
that
the
social
ideal
in
which
i
was
bred
is
the
villain
of
my
plot
for
we
wished
sincerely
for
the
best
and
the
best
that
we
knew
was
cast
only
in
one
mould
i
have
begun
to
think
indeed
that
this
more
than
anything
else
accounts
for
the
personal
disaster
which
waits
so
often
on
the
heels
of
genius
that
we
assume
it
to
be
the
inalienable
condition
for
genius
tends
to
spring
from
that
stratum
of
society
for
which
when
it
has
come
to
its
full
flower
it
is
most
unfit
and
it
comes
up
slanting
and
aside
like
a
blade
of
grass
under
a
potsherd
of
the
broken
mould
of
unrelated
ideals
somewhere
there
must
have
been
men
and
women
working
out
our
situation
and
working
it
out
successfully
but
the
only
example
life
afforded
us
was
not
of
the
acceptable
pattern
still
my
agreement
with
garrett
that
it
was
after
all
pattern
saved
us
from
mutual
accusation
and
recrimination
concerned
as
i
was
to
make
the
most
and
the
best
of
him
i
kept
looking
out
all
the
way
after
the
train
struck
into
the
southwest
for
every
intimation
of
the
life
there
which
would
have
helped
me
to
get
at
the
springs
of
his
behaviour
and
was
by
turns
shocked
away
from
its
bleakness
and
drawn
with
a
rush
of
sympathy
toward
what
a
man
must
endure
to
live
in
it
if
i
saw
myself
as
he
had
sometimes
sketched
me
filling
its
bleak
and
unprofitable
reaches
with
my
gift
as
with
flame
and
flower
i
was
as
many
times
shudderingly
brought
face
to
face
with
the
question
as
to
where
in
the
wilderness
i
was
to
find
wherewithal
to
go
on
burning
at
los
angeles
a
town
of
which
i
had
heard
him
speak
as
a
place
with
a
spirit
with
which
he
was
in
sympathy
i
had
nothing
to
look
at
for
a
week
but
a
great
deal
of
rather
formless
wooden
architecture
expressing
nothing
so
much
as
the
attempt
to
reconcile
taylorvillian
tastes
and
perceptions
with
a
subtropical
opportunity
i
do
not
know
what
that
city
may
have
become
since
i
visited
it
but
at
the
time
it
was
notable
for
a
disposition
to
take
the
amplitude
of
its
pretension
for
performance
its
theatrical
season
if
it
had
any
had
dwindled
to
that
execrable
sort
of
entertainment
which
comes
up
in
any
community
like
a
weed
when
the
women
are
out
of
town
and
if
there
had
been
anybody
i
knew
there
i
should
have
been
debarred
from
making
myself
known
to
them
until
i
had
seen
garrett
and
learned
his
plans
i
took
to
spending
my
time
as
far
out
of
town
as
i
could
manage
and
by
degrees
a
strange
seductive
beauty
began
to
make
itself
felt
with
me
a
large
unabashed
kind
of
beauty
that
disdained
prettiness
and
dared
to
dispense
with
charm
it
was
a
land
ribbed
and
sinewed
with
all
i
had
set
my
hand
to
making
free
with
it
as
kings
do
with
their
dignity
and
the
moment
helmeth
came
before
the
warmth
of
renewal
had
its
way
with
us
i
saw
that
the
land
had
set
its
mark
on
him
he
was
thinner
his
manner
hurried
obsessed
there
are
times
no
doubt
when
loving
must
be
set
aside
for
the
sterner
business
of
living
but
it
was
what
i
had
come
to
los
angeles
for
i
was
flushed
with
success
i
had
spread
the
crest
of
my
femininity
i
was
prepared
to
be
adorable
enchanting
and
i
found
that
what
was
expected
of
me
was
to
sit
by
in
my
room
in
the
hotel
on
the
chance
of
his
having
time
for
me
between
the
exigencies
of
buying
and
iron
piping
he
was
so
tired
at
times
that
i
was
made
to
feel
that
my
demand
upon
him
for
the
attitude
was
an
additional
harassment
and
there
was
so
little
else
i
could
do
for
him
not
that
i
would
have
been
glad
to
have
done
him
a
wifely
service
laid
out
his
clothes
and
seen
to
it
that
he
had
his
meals
regularly
but
what
i
could
do
was
subservient
to
the
necessity
of
keeping
our
relation
secret
it
struck
witheringly
on
all
my
sweet
illusion
of
what
i
could
be
to
him
to
have
it
so
brought
home
to
me
that
the
uses
of
affection
are
largely
dependent
on
the
habit
of
living
together
at
any
rate
i
said
consoling
myself
for
his
scant
hours
with
me
we
shall
have
all
day
sunday
together
helmeth
you
do
mean
to
say
something
curiously
like
embarrassment
suffused
him
i
shall
have
to
spend
most
of
sunday
at
pasadena
at
the
howards
the
girls
are
there
you
know
i
did
know
and
the
circumstance
of
its
having
been
kept
from
me
smacked
of
offence
why
since
i
had
been
good
enough
to
come
all
this
distance
to
comfort
him
with
loving
had
he
not
explained
to
me
that
i
must
share
him
with
the
children
why
not
have
at
least
included
me
in
a
community
of
interest
with
them
i
thought
he
extenuated
that
the
girls
were
the
chief
obstacle
to
your
marrying
me
that
you
might
get
to
feel
differently
about
them
if
you
did
have
them
thrust
too
much
upon
you
oh
helmeth
i
began
to
imagine
a
perversity
in
his
avoidance
of
the
main
issue
it
is
the
girls
it
is
anything
of
yours
it
is
something
of
mine
it
is
my
art
you
are
willing
for
me
to
bring
into
the
family
with
me
it
is
because
then
i
not
accustomed
to
think
of
the
stage
as
being
the
sort
of
thing
that
belongs
in
a
family
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me
about
that
he
had
me
there
if
i
had
seen
a
way
to
separate
all
that
i
loved
in
my
art
from
all
that
was
most
objectionable
in
the
practice
of
it
i
should
have
married
him
and
trusted
to
carrying
my
point
afterward
i
had
a
vision
of
helmeth
girls
overhearing
polatkin
advising
me
about
the
fit
of
my
corsets
and
me
calling
him
poly
i
came
back
on
another
path
to
my
recently
awakened
resentment
just
the
same
you
ought
to
have
told
me
howard
is
miss
sister
is
she
they
do
live
together
he
had
answered
my
unspoken
question
as
though
the
ideas
that
were
forming
in
my
head
had
been
in
juxtaposition
in
his
own
before
miss
stanley
and
the
young
brother
you
remember
him
at
cadenabbia
live
at
the
old
place
she
has
been
a
mother
to
him
ah
i
could
forbear
to
suggest
and
she
mothering
your
children
now
good
heavens
olivia
you
are
not
jealous
are
you
yes
i
am
i
told
him
i
jealous
of
every
minute
you
spend
away
from
me
i
jealous
of
the
men
you
do
business
with
men
who
can
talk
with
you
hear
your
voice
oh
my
dear
my
dear
i
put
my
hands
up
to
his
shoulders
and
cried
a
little
upon
his
breast
his
arms
were
about
me
for
me
all
time
and
place
dissolved
only
to
keep
them
there
look
here
olivia
if
you
feel
this
way
let
us
go
and
be
married
and
then
we
can
spend
sunday
all
together
i
did
not
mean
to
urge
you
just
now
things
are
pretty
rough
with
me
it
will
be
a
year
or
two
before
i
can
straighten
them
out
but
after
all
i
guess
our
feelings
count
for
something
i
could
i
protested
you
do
understand
there
polatkin
and
jerry
he
has
written
this
play
for
me
we
are
all
tied
up
together
you
know
how
it
would
be
if
any
of
your
partners
should
withdraw
a
woman
has
no
business
to
be
tied
up
to
any
man
but
her
husband
he
broke
out
think
of
any
other
man
being
able
to
tell
my
wife
what
she
should
or
should
do
we
went
over
that
ground
again
until
we
ceased
from
sheer
exhaustion
it
came
to
this
at
last
that
he
proposed
that
i
should
marry
him
at
once
i
could
go
back
to
mexico
with
him
i
had
to
begin
rehearsals
until
september
we
could
have
the
summer
together
and
then
i
could
go
back
to
my
work
until
he
could
claim
me
for
a
wild
moment
i
yielded
to
the
suggestion
if
i
could
have
him
and
my
art
but
i
hope
i
am
not
altogether
a
cad
i
saw
what
all
his
efforts
could
not
keep
me
from
seeing
that
even
to
do
that
for
me
to
get
me
into
his
place
in
mexico
and
back
again
would
be
a
tax
on
him
and
to
ask
him
to
do
it
with
a
reservation
in
my
mind
would
be
more
than
i
would
stand
for
it
is
fair
helmeth
my
letting
you
think
that
anything
could
pull
me
away
from
the
stage
it
is
that
i
do
agree
with
you
about
how
a
husband
and
wife
ought
to
be
with
one
another
nor
that
i
am
not
entirely
of
the
opinion
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
stage
is
not
the
place
to
bring
up
children
the
way
you
want
yours
brought
up
it
is
because
not
even
the
kind
of
marriage
you
offer
me
would
hold
me
you
mean
that
you
leave
me
that
you
go
back
to
it
well
why
not
i
left
my
first
husband
i
know
that
was
the
way
it
seemed
to
me
then
but
that
what
it
amounted
to
and
he
fell
in
love
with
the
village
dressmaker
i
had
never
told
him
that
part
of
my
life
i
had
never
thought
of
it
in
the
terms
in
which
i
had
just
stated
it
i
saw
him
grow
slowly
white
under
the
of
his
skin
i
see
if
your
only
idea
in
staying
with
me
is
that
i
might
good
god
olivia
do
you
know
what
you
said
to
me
nothing
except
what
is
right
for
you
to
know
do
you
remember
helmeth
what
i
told
you
mark
eversley
called
me
a
woman
of
genius
i
remember
he
was
looking
at
me
now
as
though
the
phrase
were
a
sort
of
acid
test
which
brought
out
in
me
traits
unsuspected
before
well
then
i
those
two
things
a
woman
and
a
genius
and
the
woman
was
meant
for
you
do
think
i
do
know
that
and
am
not
proud
of
it
with
every
fibre
of
my
brain
and
body
i
should
have
been
glad
once
if
it
were
possible
i
be
glad
now
to
have
kept
your
house
and
borne
your
children
and
see
to
it
that
they
brushed
their
teeth
and
had
hair
ribbons
to
match
their
clothes
their
mother
thought
that
was
important
he
snatched
at
this
as
at
an
incontestable
evidence
of
my
being
all
that
i
was
trying
to
show
him
that
i
was
not
it
important
i
remember
to
this
day
the
effect
on
me
of
my
hair
ribbons
he
broke
in
eagerly
if
you
can
see
that
if
you
understand
what
their
mother
wanted
things
i
missed
out
of
my
life
through
having
no
mother
that
i
heard
you
say
you
missed
partly
out
of
yours
birthdays
and
christmas
and
good
chances
to
marry
when
they
grow
up
i
do
understand
helmeth
but
what
i
trying
to
tell
you
is
that
i
ca
go
through
with
it
those
are
the
things
that
belong
to
the
woman
that
it
takes
all
the
woman
time
to
do
the
way
their
mother
would
have
them
done
and
for
me
the
woman
has
been
swamped
in
the
genius
oh
i
do
say
that
i
not
a
better
actress
for
having
tried
so
long
to
be
merely
a
woman
for
being
able
even
now
to
know
all
that
you
mean
when
you
say
but
there
it
is
i
am
an
actress
and
i
ca
leave
off
being
one
just
by
saying
so
and
i
ca
leave
off
being
a
proper
father
to
my
girls
i
owe
them
the
things
we
been
talking
about
just
as
i
owe
them
a
living
i
suppose
i
should
have
married
for
their
sakes
supposing
i
could
get
anybody
to
have
me
even
if
i
had
found
you
and
i
do
want
finding
you
to
mean
anything
but
the
best
to
them
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
that
and
he
went
back
to
a
thought
that
had
often
been
between
us
we
ought
to
have
married
when
we
were
young
he
insisted
as
though
somehow
that
made
a
better
case
of
it
if
you
had
begun
you
would
have
been
called
on
to
leave
it
off
the
point
is
that
it
wo
leave
genius
i
do
know
what
it
is
except
that
it
is
nothing
to
be
conceited
about
because
you
ca
help
it
is
a
thing
you
can
pick
up
or
lay
down
at
your
pleasure
it
a
possession
i
could
see
that
he
did
altogether
follow
me
that
he
was
not
very
far
removed
and
that
only
by
his
admiration
for
me
from
the
taylorvillian
idea
that
to
speak
of
yourself
as
a
genius
was
to
pay
yourself
an
unwarrantable
compliment
and
that
the
most
i
could
get
him
to
understand
of
the
meaning
of
my
work
was
what
grew
out
of
his
being
a
most
competent
workman
himself
he
went
back
to
the
original
proposition
does
that
mean
then
that
you
are
not
going
to
marry
me
it
means
that
i
not
going
to
leave
the
stage
to
do
it
it
seems
to
me
to
mean
that
you
do
love
me
as
you
have
professed
to
oh
i
know
how
women
love
good
women
helmeth
i
beg
your
pardon
olivia
we
stood
aghast
at
what
we
had
brought
upon
ourselves
across
the
breach
of
dissension
we
rushed
together
with
effacing
passion
after
all
i
believe
i
should
have
gone
with
him
if
he
had
had
the
wit
to
know
that
the
point
at
which
a
woman
is
most
prepared
for
yielding
is
the
next
instant
after
she
has
just
stated
the
insuperable
objection
whether
he
knew
or
not
the
whole
of
his
outer
attention
was
taken
up
with
the
purchase
of
pump
fittings
understand
that
i
did
for
a
moment
suppose
that
i
had
lost
him
that
i
did
believe
anything
but
that
i
could
go
to
him
at
any
moment
if
the
whim
seized
me
that
i
could
in
reason
pull
him
back
if
the
need
of
him
arose
i
finished
out
my
vacation
at
resorts
up
and
down
the
california
coast
warm
with
the
certainty
that
i
should
see
him
in
new
york
the
next
winter
chapter
viii
the
next
season
was
a
brilliant
one
made
so
by
the
strength
of
my
wanting
him
and
by
the
sense
of
completeness
and
finality
which
came
to
me
out
of
the
faith
that
we
had
been
ordained
to
be
lovers
from
the
beginning
it
began
to
seem
in
the
fashion
in
which
we
had
been
brought
together
as
boy
and
girl
and
then
mated
in
ways
which
creditable
as
they
had
been
yet
offered
no
obstacle
to
the
freshness
and
vitality
of
our
passion
that
we
had
been
guided
by
that
intelligence
which
in
any
emergency
of
my
gift
i
felt
rush
to
save
it
that
i
had
been
prevented
from
any
absorbing
interest
until
it
had
grown
and
flowered
in
me
appeared
now
to
have
come
about
by
direct
manipulation
of
the
powers
i
had
curious
and
interesting
adventures
that
winter
in
the
farthest
unexplored
territory
of
the
artistic
consciousness
which
tempt
me
at
every
turn
to
put
by
my
story
for
the
purpose
of
making
them
plain
to
you
and
i
am
only
deterred
from
it
by
the
certainty
that
you
get
it
plain
in
any
case
a
few
days
ago
i
picked
up
a
copy
of
dante
and
found
myself
convicted
of
shallowness
in
never
having
taken
his
passion
for
the
beatrice
seriously
by
finding
the
evidence
of
its
absolute
quality
in
the
circle
within
circle
of
his
hells
and
paradisos
the
rhythm
of
aches
and
exaltations
and
if
you
could
get
that
from
dante
how
much
less
from
anything
i
might
have
to
say
to
you
after
all
these
years
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
relation
of
art
to
passion
but
i
have
experienced
it
if
i
said
anything
it
would
be
by
way
of
persuading
you
that
loving
is
not
an
end
in
itself
but
the
pull
upward
to
our
native
heaven
which
is
no
heaven
but
a
world
of
the
spirit
wherein
things
are
made
and
remade
and
called
good
what
i
made
out
of
it
at
that
time
was
the
material
of
a
satisfying
success
and
though
i
got
on
without
him
much
better
than
i
could
have
expected
the
fact
that
after
all
he
did
not
get
any
nearer
to
me
than
the
pacific
coast
had
its
effect
in
the
year
adventures
that
i
missed
my
lover
infinitely
that
i
was
thinned
in
the
body
by
the
sheer
want
of
him
that
i
had
moments
of
mad
resolve
of
passionate
cry
to
him
goes
without
saying
one
need
not
in
a
certain
society
say
more
of
love
than
that
one
has
it
to
be
understood
as
well
as
if
one
displayed
a
yellow
ribbon
in
the
company
of
orangemen
but
since
i
could
say
it
an
opinion
passed
current
among
my
friends
that
i
was
working
too
hard
and
in
need
of
a
holiday
it
came
around
at
last
to
polatkin
himself
noticing
it
though
i
believe
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
reason
why
i
should
be
restless
and
sleepless
eyed
it
was
just
after
i
had
heard
from
helmeth
that
he
possibly
hope
to
be
in
new
york
for
another
year
that
my
manager
suggested
that
it
might
be
good
business
policy
for
me
to
play
a
short
tour
in
three
or
four
of
the
leading
cities
a
strictly
limited
season
which
would
be
enough
to
whet
the
public
appetite
without
satisfying
it
what
cities
i
believe
that
i
jumped
at
it
in
the
hope
somehow
that
it
might
be
stretched
to
include
los
angeles
where
helmeth
was
at
that
moment
and
where
i
felt
sure
he
would
come
to
me
when
i
learned
however
that
nothing
was
contemplated
farther
west
than
chicago
i
lost
interest
that
very
day
i
had
a
telegram
will
you
marry
me
signed
garrett
it
was
dated
at
los
angeles
and
as
i
could
think
of
no
reason
for
this
urgency
i
concluded
that
it
must
be
because
the
association
there
with
the
idea
of
me
had
been
too
much
for
him
and
in
that
new
yielding
of
mine
to
the
beguiling
circumstance
i
was
disposed
to
interpret
it
as
evidence
that
he
was
coming
round
i
wired
back
if
you
marry
my
work
olivia
and
prepared
myself
for
the
renewal
of
that
dear
struggle
which
if
it
got
us
no
further
at
least
involved
us
in
coil
upon
coil
of
emotion
making
him
by
the
very
force
he
spent
on
it
more
completely
mine
i
expected
him
in
every
knock
on
the
door
every
foot
on
the
stair
and
had
he
come
to
me
then
would
no
doubt
have
provoked
him
to
that
traditional
conquest
which
as
it
has
its
root
in
a
situation
made
affected
for
the
express
purpose
of
provocation
is
the
worst
possible
basis
for
a
successful
marriage
on
the
day
on
which
at
the
earliest
i
could
have
expected
him
from
los
angeles
i
sent
my
maid
away
in
order
that
if
i
should
find
him
there
in
the
old
place
waiting
for
me
there
should
be
no
constraint
on
the
drama
of
assault
and
surrender
for
which
i
found
myself
primed
then
by
degrees
it
began
to
grow
plain
to
me
that
he
did
not
mean
to
come
that
the
question
and
my
answer
to
it
had
carried
some
sort
of
finality
to
his
mind
that
was
not
apparent
to
mine
by
the
time
i
had
a
letter
from
him
written
at
the
mine
with
no
reference
in
it
to
what
had
passed
so
recently
between
us
i
understood
that
he
would
not
ask
me
to
marry
him
again
he
had
accepted
the
situation
of
being
my
lover
merely
and
i
was
not
any
more
to
be
vexed
by
the
alternative
i
said
to
myself
that
it
was
better
to
have
it
resolved
with
so
little
pain
and
that
it
should
be
my
part
to
see
that
what
we
were
to
one
another
was
to
yield
its
proper
fruit
of
happiness
i
found
myself
at
a
loss
however
in
the
application
for
though
you
may
have
satisfied
yourself
of
the
moral
propriety
of
dispensing
with
the
convention
of
publicity
you
can
not
very
well
with
a
week
journey
between
you
get
forward
in
the
business
of
making
a
man
happy
about
this
time
jerry
began
to
be
anxious
about
what
i
could
prevent
showing
in
my
face
the
wasting
evidence
of
love
divided
from
its
natural
use
of
loving
you
break
down
altogether
he
expostulated
and
then
where
will
i
be
he
was
tremendously
interested
in
his
new
play
which
was
by
far
the
best
thing
he
had
done
and
in
the
process
of
getting
it
to
the
public
he
had
so
identified
it
with
my
interpretation
that
he
was
no
longer
able
to
think
of
the
one
without
the
other
there
had
come
into
his
manner
a
new
solicitude
very
pleasing
to
me
born
of
his
sense
of
possession
in
me
in
as
much
as
i
was
the
lovely
lady
of
his
play
and
a
sort
of
awe
of
all
that
i
put
into
it
that
transcended
his
own
notion
and
yet
was
so
integral
a
part
of
it
it
had
brought
him
out
of
his
old
acceptance
of
me
as
a
foil
and
relief
for
the
shallow
iridescence
that
other
women
produced
in
him
he
had
begun
to
have
for
me
a
little
of
that
calculating
tenderness
with
which
a
man
might
regard
the
mother
of
his
nursing
child
night
by
night
then
as
he
came
hovering
about
me
he
could
not
fail
to
observe
though
he
could
hardly
have
understood
it
the
wearing
hunger
with
which
i
came
from
my
work
pushed
on
by
it
to
more
and
more
desperate
need
of
loving
and
drawn
back
by
its
unrelenting
grip
from
the
artistic
ruin
in
which
the
satisfaction
of
that
hunger
would
involve
me
now
at
his
very
natural
expression
of
concern
i
felt
myself
unaccountably
irritated
jerry
i
demanded
of
him
would
it
matter
so
much
if
we
left
off
altogether
writing
plays
and
playing
them
would
it
matter
you
are
in
a
bad
way
if
you
begun
to
question
that
what
does
living
matter
we
are
here
and
we
have
to
go
on
yes
but
when
we
go
on
at
such
pains
is
there
any
more
behind
us
than
there
is
behind
a
ball
when
it
is
set
rolling
are
we
aimed
at
anything
oh
lord
olivia
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
he
was
sitting
in
my
most
commodious
chair
with
his
long
knees
crossed
to
prop
up
a
manuscript
from
which
he
was
reading
me
the
notes
of
a
tragedy
he
was
about
to
undertake
and
his
quills
were
almost
erect
with
the
tweaking
he
had
given
them
in
the
process
of
arriving
at
his
climax
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
the
breaking
off
of
his
marriage
which
in
the
nature
of
the
case
could
not
be
broken
off
sharp
but
had
writhed
and
frayed
him
like
the
twisting
of
a
green
stick
by
setting
jerry
free
for
those
light
adventures
of
the
affections
which
had
been
so
largely
responsible
for
the
rupture
of
his
domestic
relations
instead
of
multiplying
his
propensity
by
his
opportunity
had
landed
him
on
a
plane
of
in
which
they
were
no
longer
needful
the
poet
in
jerry
would
never
be
able
to
resist
the
attraction
of
youth
and
freshness
but
the
man
in
him
was
forever
and
unassailably
beyond
their
reach
i
was
never
more
convinced
of
this
than
when
he
turned
on
this
occasion
from
the
preoccupation
of
his
creative
mood
to
offer
whatever
his
point
of
attachment
life
had
provided
him
to
bridge
across
the
chasm
of
my
spirit
i
do
see
why
it
is
important
that
we
should
know
what
we
are
working
for
we
might
in
our
confounded
egotism
not
approve
of
it
we
might
even
think
we
could
improve
on
the
pattern
i
write
plays
and
you
act
them
and
a
bee
makes
honey
i
suppose
there
a
beekeeper
about
but
that
none
of
our
business
ah
if
we
could
only
be
sure
of
that
if
he
would
only
make
himself
manifest
that
what
i
looking
for
just
a
hint
of
what
he
trying
to
do
with
us
well
i
can
tell
you
he
smoke
you
out
of
new
york
and
into
a
sanitarium
if
you
do
know
enough
to
take
a
change
and
a
rest
poly
wants
me
to
go
on
the
road
for
a
while
sort
of
triumphal
progress
he
thinks
applause
will
cure
me
you
getting
that
now
what
would
bring
you
around
would
be
a
good
frost
you
would
want
that
in
chicago
jerry
disentangled
his
limbs
and
sat
up
sniffing
the
wind
of
success
if
i
could
have
you
to
open
with
my
play
in
chicago
he
averred
solemnly
i
be
ready
to
sing
the
lord
dismiss
us
he
really
thought
so
to
go
back
to
the
scene
of
his
early
struggle
with
his
laurels
fresh
on
him
to
satisfy
the
predictions
of
his
earliest
friends
and
confound
his
detractors
above
all
to
be
received
in
his
own
country
with
that
honour
which
is
denied
to
prophets
seemed
to
him
then
almost
as
desirable
in
prospect
as
it
proved
in
fact
not
to
be
i
found
another
advantage
in
the
confusion
and
excitement
of
touring
in
being
able
to
conceal
from
myself
that
i
had
had
a
satisfactory
letter
from
helmeth
since
the
pair
of
telegrams
that
passed
between
us
and
no
letter
at
all
for
a
long
time
it
was
always
possible
to
pretend
to
myself
that
the
letters
had
been
written
but
were
delayed
in
forwarding
it
was
a
raw
spring
day
when
we
came
to
chicago
the
promise
of
the
season
in
the
sun
denied
and
flouted
by
the
wind
it
slanted
the
tails
of
the
labouring
teams
and
cast
over
the
clean
furrow
handfuls
of
the
winter
rubbish
from
the
stubble
yet
unturned
and
between
field
and
field
it
wrung
the
tops
of
the
leafless
wood
now
and
then
it
parted
them
on
white
painted
spires
without
disturbing
them
or
the
rows
of
thin
white
gravestones
it
laid
bare
the
roots
of
my
life
to
the
cold
blasts
of
memory
it
rendered
me
again
the
pagan
touch
the
undivided
part
that
the
earth
had
in
me
my
dead
were
in
its
sod
in
me
the
sap
of
its
spiritual
fervours
and
renunciations
what
was
i
what
was
my
art
but
the
flower
the
bright
exotic
blossom
borne
upon
its
topmost
bough
its
dying
top
here
in
its
abounding
villages
in
the
county
roads
was
the
root
and
trunk
outside
the
wind
flicked
the
landscape
like
the
screen
of
the
moving
picture
that
the
swift
roll
of
the
train
made
of
it
and
i
felt
again
the
pressure
of
my
small
son
upon
my
arm
and
the
pleasant
stir
of
domesticity
and
the
return
of
my
man
for
the
last
hour
jerry
had
come
to
sit
in
my
compartment
opposite
me
and
stare
stonily
out
of
the
window
now
and
then
his
jaws
relaxed
and
set
again
as
he
bit
hard
upon
the
bitter
end
of
experience
no
one
i
suppose
can
go
through
that
country
so
teeming
with
the
evidences
of
the
common
life
the
common
labour
the
common
hope
of
immortality
and
not
feel
bereft
in
as
much
as
the
circumstances
of
his
destiny
divide
him
from
it
we
passed
higgleston
beyond
the
roofs
of
it
the
elms
that
marked
the
cemetery
road
gathered
green
the
roofs
of
the
town
were
steeped
in
windy
light
i
had
no
impulse
to
stop
there
i
withdrew
from
it
as
one
does
from
a
private
affair
upon
which
he
has
stumbled
unaware
rather
it
was
not
i
who
withdrew
but
life
as
it
was
lived
there
turned
its
back
upon
me
getting
in
to
chicago
through
that
smoky
wooden
wilderness
within
which
the
city
obscures
itself
as
a
cuttlefish
in
its
own
inky
cloud
i
felt
again
the
wounding
and
affront
the
cold
shoulder
lifted
on
my
needs
the
eager
hand
stretched
out
to
catch
my
contribution
chicago
received
me
with
its
hat
off
bowing
to
meet
me
and
when
i
remembered
how
nearly
it
had
let
me
fall
into
the
pit
prepared
for
me
by
griffin
and
the
i
burned
with
resentment
it
was
seven
years
now
since
i
had
seen
the
city
or
pauline
the
only
friend
i
had
made
there
who
could
be
supposed
to
take
an
interest
in
my
coming
again
i
meant
of
course
to
see
pauline
we
had
kept
up
a
correspondence
which
with
the
years
had
shown
a
disposition
to
confine
itself
to
a
christmas
reminder
and
an
occasional
marked
copy
of
a
magazine
but
i
meant
of
course
to
see
her
i
had
trusted
to
her
finding
out
through
the
newspapers
that
i
would
be
there
and
on
such
a
date
it
fell
in
quite
naturally
with
my
inclination
to
have
her
card
sent
up
to
me
the
next
morning
a
little
after
eleven
i
was
needing
to
be
distracted
on
my
way
up
from
breakfast
i
had
met
jerry
going
down
with
his
suit
case
back
to
new
york
he
admitted
to
my
question
as
quick
as
i
can
get
there
but
with
all
this
success
why
they
fairly
stood
on
their
feet
last
night
i
know
i
know
he
looked
unendurably
harassed
i
ca
stand
it
olivia
i
ca
stand
it
this
place
is
full
of
ghosts
i
remembered
that
both
his
children
had
been
born
there
and
that
he
had
not
seem
them
for
more
than
a
year
and
i
did
not
press
him
i
keep
your
end
up
for
a
week
if
i
can
i
assured
him
as
he
wrung
my
hand
he
turned
back
when
he
was
a
step
or
two
down
the
stair
do
stay
too
long
yourself
he
admonished
new
york
the
place
i
was
feeling
that
when
pauline
came
to
me
it
was
until
i
saw
her
that
i
realized
what
a
distance
there
was
in
spite
of
our
common
youth
had
always
been
between
us
it
started
out
for
us
both
in
the
first
glimpse
we
had
of
one
another
in
the
witness
in
all
the
inconsiderable
elements
of
line
and
colour
which
go
to
make
up
a
woman
appearance
of
growth
and
amplitude
in
me
and
fulfilment
in
hers
pauline
had
been
in
her
girlhood
if
not
pretty
at
least
what
is
known
as
an
attractive
girl
and
though
there
was
only
a
matter
of
months
between
us
it
came
to
me
with
a
shock
that
she
was
now
not
only
not
particularly
attractive
but
it
was
not
so
much
in
the
fulness
under
her
chin
which
apparently
caused
her
no
uneasiness
nor
in
the
thickness
of
her
waist
of
which
i
was
sure
she
made
a
virtue
but
in
the
certainty
that
all
that
was
ever
to
happen
to
her
in
the
way
of
illuminating
and
passion
had
already
happened
she
had
reached
she
must
have
reached
about
the
time
i
was
taking
my
flight
upward
by
the
help
of
morris
polatkin
the
full
level
of
her
capacity
to
experience
she
was
living
still
as
i
saw
by
the
card
which
i
still
held
in
my
hand
in
evanston
and
she
was
living
there
because
it
was
no
longer
within
the
scope
of
her
possibility
to
live
anywhere
else
all
this
flashed
through
me
in
the
moment
in
which
pauline
checked
by
what
she
was
able
to
guess
of
unfamiliar
elements
in
me
was
crossing
the
room
and
taking
me
by
the
hands
in
the
old
womanly
way
keyed
down
to
the
certainty
of
not
requiring
it
in
her
business
any
more
it
was
so
patent
that
pauline
was
now
in
the
position
of
having
done
her
duty
toward
life
and
henry
mills
and
was
accepting
all
that
came
to
her
from
it
as
her
due
that
it
almost
seemed
for
a
moment
that
she
had
said
something
of
the
kind
what
did
pass
between
us
besides
a
kiss
of
greeting
were
some
commonplaces
about
my
being
there
and
how
pleased
henry
and
the
children
would
be
to
see
me
we
sat
down
on
a
sofa
together
and
for
a
moment
the
old
girlish
confidence
put
forth
a
tender
sprig
of
renewal
so
many
years
since
we
were
at
school
together
you
gone
a
long
way
since
then
olivia
a
long
way
i
admitted
but
she
did
catch
the
double
meaning
the
phrase
had
for
me
henry
and
i
were
talking
about
it
this
morning
and
the
times
you
had
here
in
chicago
you
poor
dear
you
had
to
make
a
good
many
starts
before
you
got
on
the
right
road
at
last
a
great
many
but
you
found
out
that
it
all
came
right
in
the
end
did
you
that
it
was
best
just
for
you
to
trust
you
used
to
be
bitter
about
it
but
trusting
is
always
best
oh
if
you
think
i
been
trusting
all
these
years
i
been
working
of
course
course
much
of
her
old
manner
came
back
with
the
occasion
for
moralizing
but
you
were
too
amusing
you
were
quite
fierce
with
henry
because
he
would
do
anything
about
it
she
laughed
reminiscently
and
now
you
see
her
look
travelled
about
the
room
full
of
the
evidence
of
prosperity
pauline
i
said
if
you
are
thinking
that
i
could
have
gone
to
new
york
and
become
the
success
i
am
the
help
that
you
and
henry
might
have
given
me
you
are
making
a
great
mistake
what
did
happen
was
that
i
had
to
accept
it
from
a
quarter
where
it
was
so
much
to
be
expected
and
was
not
nearly
so
agreeable
that
man
mark
eversley
found
for
you
you
mean
well
i
suppose
you
did
get
on
better
for
a
little
start
start
i
cried
start
i
had
to
have
everything
food
and
clothes
a
sudden
recollection
flashed
upon
me
of
those
first
days
in
new
york
of
myself
become
merely
a
dummy
on
which
to
hang
a
fat
little
notions
of
acceptable
contours
the
offence
of
it
the
greater
offence
from
which
by
the
opportune
appearance
of
the
jew
i
had
so
hardly
escaped
have
you
any
idea
pauline
what
it
means
to
have
a
man
invest
money
in
you
a
man
like
polatkin
i
was
his
property
a
horse
he
had
entered
for
the
race
he
had
a
stake
on
me
pauline
looked
aghast
vague
recollections
of
the
actress
heroines
of
fiction
shaped
her
thought
you
do
mean
to
say
olivia
that
you
that
you
were
his
mistress
i
finished
for
her
bluntly
is
that
the
only
thing
your
imagination
takes
offence
at
is
it
enough
for
me
to
tell
you
that
he
orders
my
corsets
for
me
that
did
reach
her
i
could
see
her
struggle
with
the
habitual
effort
to
put
the
unwelcome
fact
down
anywhere
out
of
sight
and
knowledge
under
the
cotton
wool
of
a
moral
sentiment
even
now
if
she
could
escape
being
implicated
in
my
predicament
by
avoiding
the
knowledge
of
it
she
would
not
only
do
that
but
convict
herself
of
superiority
as
well
my
gorge
rose
against
it
but
if
i
did
sell
myself
to
the
jew
i
drove
it
home
to
her
it
was
chiefly
because
he
was
decenter
to
me
than
the
circumstance
gave
me
a
right
to
expect
i
came
near
doing
it
for
a
cheaper
man
and
for
a
cheaper
price
a
man
who
had
deserted
one
wife
and
a
bigamist
in
fact
if
you
do
know
that
there
were
days
when
i
would
have
sold
myself
for
something
to
eat
it
was
because
you
did
take
the
pains
to
but
you
never
said
a
word
of
course
if
you
had
told
me
the
truth
she
floundered
and
saved
herself
on
what
she
believed
to
be
a
just
resentment
but
i
had
no
notion
of
letting
her
off
so
easily
i
did
not
know
exactly
how
we
had
got
launched
on
the
subject
it
had
not
been
in
my
mind
to
do
so
when
she
came
in
but
all
the
events
of
the
past
year
seemed
to
lead
up
to
it
to
come
somehow
to
the
point
of
rupture
against
her
smooth
acceptance
of
my
success
as
being
derived
from
the
same
process
as
her
own
i
did
tell
you
that
i
was
in
need
of
money
to
put
me
in
the
way
of
earning
a
living
i
insisted
i
did
not
ask
you
for
charity
what
i
offered
you
was
the
chance
of
a
business
investment
one
that
rendered
the
investor
its
due
return
the
fact
that
you
did
not
know
enough
about
the
business
to
know
how
good
it
was
i
forestalled
what
i
saw
rising
to
her
lips
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
were
my
friend
and
professed
to
admire
my
talent
i
had
a
right
to
have
what
i
said
about
it
heard
respectfully
i
had
got
up
from
the
pink
and
white
sofa
where
our
talk
had
begun
and
was
trailing
about
the
room
in
my
breakfast
gown
and
the
suggestion
of
staginess
in
the
way
the
folds
of
it
followed
my
movements
irritated
me
with
the
certainty
that
the
effect
of
it
on
pauline
would
be
to
mitigate
the
sincerity
of
what
i
said
you
known
me
long
enough
i
accused
her
to
know
that
i
have
asked
for
money
until
i
was
in
the
last
extremity
and
then
i
would
have
asked
it
for
myself
i
do
know
that
it
would
have
mattered
if
i
had
starved
but
my
gift
was
worth
saving
i
did
dream
she
began
i
had
any
idea
well
why
did
you
ask
henry
then
henry
knows
what
becomes
of
women
on
the
stage
when
they
ca
make
a
living
this
was
nearer
to
the
mark
than
i
had
meant
to
let
myself
go
but
i
could
see
that
it
carried
no
illumination
she
drew
up
her
wrap
and
braced
herself
for
one
more
gallant
effort
the
things
you
been
through
my
dear
i
do
wonder
you
feel
bitter
but
when
it
has
all
come
out
right
why
not
forget
it
oh
right
right
the
room
was
full
of
vases
and
floral
tokens
of
the
triumph
of
the
night
before
and
as
i
swung
about
with
my
arms
out
disdaining
her
judgment
of
rightness
for
me
i
knocked
over
a
great
basket
of
roses
and
orchids
which
had
come
from
cline
and
erskine
i
do
suppose
pauline
had
ever
knocked
over
anything
in
her
life
and
the
violence
of
my
gesture
must
have
stood
for
some
unloosening
of
the
bonds
of
convention
with
an
implication
which
only
now
began
to
work
through
to
her
you
do
mean
to
say
olivia
that
you
that
you
are
not
not
a
good
woman
oh
i
said
again
good
good
what
does
it
all
mean
i
a
successful
actress
olivia
well
no
if
you
insist
on
knowing
i
not
what
you
would
call
a
good
woman
i
threw
it
at
her
as
though
it
had
been
a
peculiar
kind
of
scorn
heaped
up
on
her
for
being
what
i
had
just
denied
myself
to
be
i
saw
myself
for
once
with
all
my
thwarted
and
misspent
instincts
toward
the
proper
destiny
of
women
enmeshed
and
crippled
not
by
any
propensity
for
sinning
but
by
the
conditions
of
loving
which
women
like
pauline
set
up
for
me
and
if
you
want
to
know
i
said
why
i
not
a
good
woman
it
is
because
women
like
you
do
make
it
seem
particularly
worth
while
oh
she
gasped
this
is
horrible
horrible
the
word
came
out
in
a
whisper
i
saw
at
last
that
she
was
done
with
me
that
the
only
thought
that
was
left
to
her
was
to
get
away
to
put
as
much
space
as
possible
between
us
i
got
around
with
my
hand
on
the
door
to
prevent
her
pauline
pauline
i
cried
almost
wildly
as
if
even
at
the
last
she
could
have
helped
me
from
myself
ca
you
remember
that
we
grew
up
together
that
we
had
the
same
training
the
same
ideals
ca
you
remember
that
when
we
began
i
thought
that
the
life
you
had
chosen
for
yourself
was
the
best
that
i
thought
i
had
chosen
it
for
myself
too
only
for
heaven
sake
pauline
try
to
understand
me
there
is
something
that
chooses
for
us
do
you
know
that
i
would
have
been
any
different
from
what
you
are
if
i
had
been
forced
have
you
seen
how
i
been
beaten
back
from
all
that
i
tried
to
be
all
this
i
threw
out
my
arms
as
i
stood
against
the
door
to
include
all
that
had
entered
by
implication
in
our
conversation
it
had
to
come
and
it
came
wrong
because
you
wo
understand
that
a
gift
has
its
own
way
with
us
i
could
see
though
that
she
was
understanding
in
the
least
that
she
was
badly
scared
and
even
indignant
at
being
forced
to
listen
to
a
justification
of
what
by
her
code
could
have
no
justification
she
was
standing
not
far
from
me
crushed
against
the
wall
as
though
by
the
weight
of
opprobriousness
that
i
heaped
upon
her
and
her
whole
attention
was
centred
on
the
door
and
the
chance
of
getting
out
of
it
and
away
from
what
in
the
mere
despair
of
reaching
her
intelligence
with
it
i
flung
out
from
me
now
wildly
i
suppose
i
scoffed
that
it
never
occurs
to
you
that
a
gifted
woman
could
be
as
delicate
and
feminine
as
anybody
if
only
you
did
make
her
right
to
fostering
care
and
protection
conditional
on
her
giving
up
her
gift
altogether
you
i
demanded
who
tie
up
all
the
moral
values
of
living
to
your
own
little
set
of
behaviours
what
right
have
you
to
deny
us
the
opportunity
to
be
loved
honestly
because
you
ca
at
the
same
time
make
us
over
into
replicas
of
yourselves
i
was
sick
with
all
the
shames
and
struggles
of
the
women
i
had
known
i
forgot
the
door
and
went
over
to
her
you
i
said
who
fatten
your
moral
superiority
on
the
best
of
all
we
produce
how
do
you
suppose
you
are
going
to
make
us
value
the
standards
you
set
up
when
the
price
you
despise
us
for
paying
nine
times
out
of
ten
we
pay
to
the
men
who
belong
to
you
what
right
have
you
to
judge
what
we
have
done
when
you
neither
help
nor
understanding
to
offer
us
in
the
doing
what
right
what
right
for
the
moment
i
had
turned
away
in
the
vehemence
of
my
indignation
i
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
instant
when
my
attention
was
distracted
from
the
door
pauline
made
a
dart
for
it
i
could
hear
her
scurrying
down
the
hall
but
i
went
on
walking
up
and
down
in
my
room
and
talking
aloud
to
her
i
was
beside
myself
with
the
sum
of
all
indignities
was
it
not
this
set
of
prejudices
which
for
the
moment
had
presented
itself
in
the
person
of
pauline
mills
which
at
every
turn
of
my
life
had
been
erected
against
the
bourgeoning
of
my
gift
was
it
not
in
the
process
of
combating
the
tradition
of
the
preciousness
of
women
as
inherent
in
particular
occupations
that
i
had
lost
the
inestimable
preciousness
of
myself
was
it
for
what
came
out
of
pauline
frame
of
life
i
thought
of
cecelia
brune
here
that
i
had
sacrificed
my
public
possession
of
the
man
i
loved
and
what
came
out
of
it
that
was
more
to
the
world
than
what
i
had
to
offer
had
i
cut
myself
off
from
the
comfort
and
stability
of
a
home
simply
because
in
my
situation
as
famous
tragedienne
i
did
see
my
way
to
bring
up
helmeth
children
so
as
to
make
little
pauline
millses
of
them
i
was
still
raging
formlessly
in
this
fashion
when
miss
summers
our
ingénue
came
to
tell
me
that
the
cab
waited
to
take
us
to
the
theatre
for
the
matinée
all
through
the
performance
which
i
was
told
went
remarkably
well
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
seismic
shudders
and
upheavals
of
my
world
too
long
subjected
to
strain
it
came
back
on
me
in
intervals
through
the
evening
performance
i
was
physically
sick
with
it
but
by
degrees
through
its
subsidence
new
worlds
began
to
rise
by
the
time
i
left
the
theatre
that
night
i
knew
what
i
would
do
it
had
been
a
mistake
a
natural
but
cruel
mistake
for
helmeth
and
me
to
suppose
that
a
way
of
living
could
at
any
time
be
worth
the
very
sap
and
source
of
life
love
was
the
central
fact
around
which
all
modes
and
occupations
should
arrange
themselves
let
us
but
love
then
and
live
as
we
may
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
need
like
the
need
i
had
for
his
breast
his
arm
always
the
point
of
our
conclusions
had
been
that
i
agreed
with
him
that
i
thought
that
failing
to
repeat
the
pattern
of
their
mother
in
his
children
i
had
failed
in
all
that
i
did
any
more
than
he
see
my
way
to
keeping
on
with
my
work
and
meeting
him
at
the
door
every
night
when
he
came
home
in
the
sort
of
garment
that
in
the
journals
went
by
the
name
of
house
gown
i
laughed
to
think
that
we
had
not
seen
before
that
it
was
ridiculous
i
had
no
more
doubt
now
no
more
trepidation
what
burned
in
me
was
so
clear
a
flame
that
he
could
not
but
be
illuminated
only
let
me
find
him
let
me
go
to
him
again
at
the
hotel
desk
where
i
paused
for
my
key
i
asked
them
to
send
up
telegraph
blanks
to
my
room
with
them
came
letters
forwarded
from
new
york
i
started
as
one
does
at
an
unexpected
presence
to
find
an
envelope
among
them
with
his
familiar
superscription
for
the
first
time
i
would
rather
not
have
had
a
letter
from
him
it
would
be
interposing
a
fresher
picture
between
me
and
my
new
resolution
to
put
him
for
the
moment
farther
from
me
i
saw
then
that
the
letter
in
my
hand
had
been
posted
at
los
angeles
it
was
as
though
he
had
leaped
suddenly
all
that
distance
nearer
than
his
chilicojote
mexico
i
noticed
that
it
was
a
very
thin
letter
a
thousand
conjectures
rushed
upon
me
not
one
of
them
with
any
relativity
to
what
i
would
find
for
when
i
tore
it
open
there
floated
out
a
printed
slip
it
was
a
clipping
from
a
pasadena
newspaper
and
announced
his
engagement
to
edith
stanley
chapter
ix
there
is
very
little
more
to
write
i
held
myself
together
until
i
had
written
to
helmeth
to
say
that
i
understood
why
he
had
done
what
he
had
done
and
that
i
hoped
he
would
be
happy
the
letter
was
not
written
to
invite
an
answer
there
was
nothing
he
could
say
to
please
me
that
would
not
have
been
disloyal
to
miss
stanley
accordingly
no
answer
came
though
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
gave
over
the
unconscious
start
at
the
sight
of
letters
the
hope
that
somehow
against
all
reason
sometimes
even
yet
for
i
did
not
understand
i
was
married
to
him
much
much
more
married
than
i
had
ever
been
to
tommy
bettersworth
and
it
was
in
me
to
understand
how
any
man
can
take
a
woman
as
he
had
taken
me
and
not
feel
himself
more
bound
than
ever
church
and
state
could
bind
him
it
was
ten
months
since
i
had
seen
him
but
that
while
my
body
still
ached
with
the
memory
of
him
he
could
have
given
himself
to
another
woman
was
an
unbelievable
offence
there
are
days
yet
when
i
do
not
believe
it
there
was
nothing
any
of
my
friends
could
do
for
me
i
had
the
sense
to
see
that
and
did
not
trouble
them
sarah
who
was
the
only
one
who
might
have
comforted
me
out
of
her
own
experience
was
all
taken
up
with
her
husband
declining
health
lawrence
died
the
next
winter
and
by
that
time
my
wound
had
got
past
the
imperative
need
of
speech
effie
was
expecting
another
baby
and
was
to
be
thought
of
so
i
turned
at
last
when
the
first
sharp
anguish
was
past
to
mark
eversley
he
in
all
america
stood
for
that
high
identification
of
his
work
with
the
source
of
power
that
it
is
the
private
study
of
all
my
days
to
reach
i
repaired
to
him
as
did
christians
of
old
to
favoured
altars
that
i
did
so
return
for
comfort
to
that
distributer
of
gifts
by
whose
very
mark
on
me
i
was
set
apart
from
the
happier
destiny
was
evidence
to
me
the
only
evidence
i
could
have
at
the
time
that
i
had
not
been
utterly
mistaken
in
the
choice
i
had
made
before
i
i
knew
all
that
the
choice
involved
eversley
and
his
wife
were
christian
scientists
and
though
they
did
not
make
me
of
their
opinion
i
owe
them
much
in
the
way
of
practice
and
example
that
keeps
me
still
within
the
circle
of
communicating
fire
i
never
to
be
broken
off
again
practical
intercourse
with
the
friends
of
the
soul
of
man
i
learned
to
apply
directly
for
the
things
i
had
supposed
came
only
by
loving
and
i
found
that
they
came
abundantly
i
grew
in
time
even
to
think
of
helmeth
without
bitterness
what
i
was
brought
to
see
over
and
above
the
wish
to
provide
a
home
for
his
children
must
have
been
at
work
in
him
was
much
the
same
thing
that
had
driven
me
to
my
work
the
very
need
of
me
must
have
hurried
him
into
the
relief
of
being
loved
it
was
the
only
way
which
his
purblind
male
instinct
pointed
him
to
find
an
outlet
for
what
goes
from
me
over
the
footlights
night
by
night
for
a
man
to
be
loved
is
of
the
greatest
importance
but
with
women
it
is
loving
that
is
the
fructifying
act
that
i
was
able
to
go
on
loving
him
was
i
suppose
the
reason
why
the
shock
i
had
sustained
left
no
regrettable
mark
upon
my
career
the
mark
it
left
on
me
was
none
other
than
work
is
supposed
to
leave
on
every
woman
what
i
am
sure
of
now
is
that
it
is
not
work
but
the
loss
of
love
that
leaves
her
impoverished
of
feminine
graces
i
grew
barren
of
manner
and
was
reputed
to
be
entirely
absorbed
in
my
profession
it
was
not
however
that
i
had
excluded
the
more
human
interests
but
they
had
taken
flight
all
the
forces
of
my
being
had
been
by
the
shock
of
loss
dropped
into
some
subterranean
pit
where
they
ran
on
underground
and
watered
the
choicest
product
of
my
art
if
i
had
married
helmeth
garrett
i
might
have
grown
insensible
to
him
as
it
was
i
seemed
to
have
been
fixed
though
by
pain
in
the
fruitful
relation
the
loss
of
him
the
desperate
ache
the
start
of
memory
are
just
as
good
materials
to
build
an
artistic
success
upon
as
the
joy
of
having
and
i
did
build
i
gathered
up
and
wrought
into
the
structure
of
my
life
the
pain
of
loving
as
well
as
its
delight
i
am
a
successful
actress
whatever
else
has
happened
to
me
i
am
at
least
a
success
i
never
saw
him
again
i
never
saw
henry
and
pauline
mills
but
once
and
some
bitterness
in
the
occasion
came
near
to
driving
me
toward
that
pit
into
which
pauline
was
willing
to
believe
i
had
already
descended
it
was
the
second
season
after
i
had
parted
from
her
in
chicago
that
some
sort
of
brokers
convention
had
brought
henry
on
to
new
york
and
pauline
with
him
and
to
the
same
hotel
where
mark
eversley
was
shut
up
with
an
attack
of
bronchitis
jerry
and
i
going
up
to
call
on
him
came
face
to
face
with
them
they
were
walking
in
the
lobby
pauline
was
in
what
for
her
was
evening
dress
her
manner
a
little
daunted
not
quite
carrying
it
off
with
the
air
of
being
established
at
the
pivot
of
existence
which
she
could
manage
so
well
at
evanston
they
were
walking
up
and
down
waiting
it
seemed
for
friends
to
join
them
and
they
wheeled
under
the
great
chandelier
just
in
time
to
come
squarely
across
us
i
could
see
pauline
clutch
at
her
husband
arm
and
the
catch
in
her
breath
with
which
she
jerked
herself
back
from
the
impulse
to
nod
and
looked
deliberately
away
from
me
for
her
the
evidence
of
my
misdoing
hung
about
me
like
an
exhalation
she
was
afraid
i
should
insist
on
speaking
to
her
and
some
of
her
friends
would
come
up
and
see
me
doing
it
i
did
however
offer
to
speak
to
her
i
looked
instead
at
henry
i
stood
still
in
my
tracks
and
looked
at
him
steadily
and
curiously
i
wished
very
much
to
know
what
he
meant
to
do
about
it
he
turned
slowly
as
i
looked
from
deep
red
to
mottled
purple
and
very
much
against
his
will
his
head
bowed
to
me
his
body
to
which
pauline
clung
dared
not
move
lest
she
detect
it
but
quite
above
and
independent
of
his
front
his
head
bowed
to
me
so
went
out
of
my
life
thirty
years
of
intimacy
which
never
succeeded
in
being
intimate
but
though
one
may
excise
thirty
years
of
one
past
without
a
tremor
one
may
not
do
it
without
a
scar
to
allay
the
irritation
of
slight
i
came
near
to
being
as
abandoned
as
she
believed
as
i
had
moments
of
believing
myself
for
the
possibility
that
helmeth
garrett
had
found
in
our
relation
of
setting
it
aside
made
it
at
times
of
a
cheapness
which
seemed
to
extend
to
me
who
had
entertained
it
i
should
have
been
happier
i
thought
to
have
taken
it
lightly
as
he
did
if
so
many
women
who
had
begun
as
i
had
begun
had
gone
on
repeating
the
particular
instance
was
it
because
they
found
that
that
was
the
easiest
the
only
possible
way
to
bear
it
how
else
could
one
ease
the
pain
of
loving
except
by
being
loved
again
and
if
i
was
to
lose
the
pauline
millses
of
the
world
by
what
had
been
entered
upon
so
sincerely
why
then
what
more
had
i
to
risk
on
the
light
adventure
all
this
time
i
was
sick
with
the
need
of
being
confirmed
in
my
faith
in
myself
as
a
person
worthy
to
be
loved
to
feel
sure
that
since
my
love
had
missed
its
mark
it
was
i
at
least
that
had
fallen
short
of
it
it
was
that
summer
jerry
had
been
driven
by
some
such
need
i
imagined
as
i
admitted
in
myself
to
put
his
future
in
jeopardy
by
another
marriage
which
on
the
face
of
it
offered
even
a
more
immediate
occasion
for
shipwreck
than
the
first
and
i
had
scrupled
to
put
forth
to
save
him
the
new
capacity
to
charm
which
had
come
upon
me
with
the
experience
of
not
caring
any
more
myself
to
be
charmed
i
knew
it
would
have
been
a
poor
tribute
to
my
skill
as
an
actress
if
i
had
by
this
time
known
the
moves
by
which
a
man
who
is
susceptible
of
being
played
upon
at
all
can
be
drawn
into
a
personal
interest
and
though
i
then
and
do
not
now
believe
that
a
love
serviceable
for
the
uses
of
living
together
can
be
built
up
out
of
made
love
i
was
willing
for
the
time
to
pit
myself
against
the
game
that
was
played
by
miss
chichester
for
jerry
peace
of
mind
i
played
it
all
the
better
for
not
being
as
the
young
lady
was
personally
involved
in
the
stake
that
i
thought
afterward
of
doing
anything
for
myself
with
what
i
had
got
when
at
last
i
had
by
this
means
brought
jerry
down
from
newport
to
my
place
on
the
hudson
for
a
week
end
was
in
part
due
to
the
extraordinary
charm
that
jerry
displayed
under
the
stimulus
of
a
male
interest
in
me
of
whom
for
years
he
had
thought
of
as
being
quite
outside
such
consideration
there
was
a
kind
of
wistfulness
about
jerry
when
he
was
a
little
in
love
that
made
him
irresistible
no
doubt
i
was
also
a
little
warmed
by
the
fire
which
i
had
blown
up
he
was
to
come
from
saturday
to
monday
and
the
moment
i
saw
him
getting
down
from
the
i
had
sent
to
the
station
for
him
i
knew
that
i
had
only
to
let
that
interest
take
its
course
to
find
myself
provided
with
a
lover
whether
or
no
i
could
command
my
heart
to
loving
i
do
not
remember
that
i
came
to
any
conscious
decision
about
it
but
i
know
that
i
yielded
myself
to
the
growing
sense
of
intimacy
that
i
consciously
drew
as
one
draws
perfume
from
a
flower
all
that
came
to
me
from
him
his
new
loverliness
touched
still
with
the
old
solicitous
sense
of
the
preciousness
of
my
gift
i
dramatized
to
the
full
the
possibility
of
what
hung
in
the
air
between
us
i
dressed
myself
i
set
the
stage
accordingly
it
was
saturday
evening
after
dinner
that
i
sent
him
to
the
garden
to
smoke
keeping
the
house
long
enough
to
fix
his
attention
on
my
joining
him
by
wondering
what
kept
me
and
so
overdid
my
part
by
just
so
much
as
i
made
myself
conscious
of
the
taint
of
theatricality
for
as
i
went
down
the
veranda
steps
to
meet
him
in
the
rose
walk
the
response
of
the
actress
in
me
to
the
perfectness
of
the
setting
and
my
fitness
for
the
part
of
the
great
lady
of
romance
drew
up
out
of
my
past
a
faint
reminder
of
myself
going
up
another
pair
of
stairs
so
many
years
ago
in
the
figure
of
an
orphan
child
toiling
through
the
world
out
of
that
memory
there
distilled
presently
a
cold
dew
over
all
my
purpose
it
was
a
perfect
night
warm
emanations
from
the
earth
shut
in
the
smell
of
the
garden
and
light
airs
from
the
river
stirred
the
trees
at
the
bottom
of
the
lawn
the
soft
full
rush
of
the
hudson
made
a
stir
like
the
hurrying
pulse
beyond
the
silver
gleam
of
its
waters
lay
the
farther
bank
strewn
with
lights
and
above
that
the
moon
low
and
and
golden
its
diffusing
light
mixed
and
mingled
with
the
shadow
of
the
moving
boughs
i
was
wearing
about
my
shoulders
a
light
scarf
that
from
time
to
time
blew
out
with
the
wind
and
as
we
paced
in
the
garden
strayed
across
jerry
breast
and
was
caught
back
by
me
but
not
before
on
its
communicating
thread
ran
an
electric
spark
it
must
have
been
a
good
two
hours
after
moonrise
before
we
turned
to
go
in
where
the
great
hall
lamp
burned
with
a
steady
glow
at
the
foot
of
the
veranda
a
breeze
sprang
up
fresher
than
before
that
caught
my
scarf
from
me
and
wrapped
us
both
in
it
as
in
a
warm
suffusing
mood
we
were
so
close
that
i
had
instinctively
to
put
up
my
hand
as
a
barricade
against
what
was
about
to
come
from
him
to
me
and
as
i
did
so
i
was
aware
of
something
that
rose
up
from
some
subterranean
crypt
in
me
that
old
romance
of
my
mother
women
like
her
worlds
of
patient
overworking
women
who
could
do
without
happiness
if
only
they
found
themselves
doing
right
somehow
they
had
laid
on
me
the
necessity
of
being
true
to
the
best
i
had
known
because
it
was
the
best
and
had
been
founded
in
integrity
and
stayed
on
renunciations
i
knew
what
i
had
come
into
the
garden
to
do
i
had
planned
for
it
i
thought
myself
prepared
to
take
up
as
many
women
of
my
profession
did
the
next
best
in
place
of
the
best
which
life
had
denied
me
but
my
past
was
too
strong
for
me
the
unslumbering
instinct
that
saves
wild
creatures
before
they
are
well
awake
had
whipped
me
out
of
the
soft
entanglement
and
before
jerry
could
grasp
the
change
of
mood
in
me
i
was
halfway
up
the
stair
this
wind
i
said
i
think
it
will
blow
up
a
rain
before
morning
i
went
on
up
before
him
you
can
see
the
river
darkling
below
its
surface
it
does
that
before
a
change
i
went
on
drawing
the
chairs
back
from
the
edge
of
the
veranda
i
called
elsa
to
fasten
all
the
windows
when
at
last
we
came
into
the
glow
of
the
hall
lamp
i
could
see
his
face
white
yet
with
what
he
had
missed
he
thought
he
had
blundered
he
caught
at
my
hand
as
i
gave
him
his
bedroom
candle
in
an
effort
to
recapture
what
had
just
trembled
in
the
air
between
us
olivia
i
say
olivia
your
train
leaves
at
i
reminded
him
i
be
up
to
pour
your
coffee
i
went
into
my
room
and
blew
out
my
candle
the
warm
summer
air
came
in
between
the
white
curtains
i
knelt
down
beside
my
bed
an
old
habit
long
discontinued
i
was
too
much
moved
to
pray
but
i
continued
to
kneel
there
a
long
time
listening
to
the
soft
shouldering
of
the
maples
against
the
wall
outside
the
window
far
within
me
there
was
something
which
inarticulately
knew
that
whatever
the
world
might
think
of
me
in
spite
of
what
i
had
confessed
to
pauline
i
was
a
good
woman
i
had
loved
helmeth
garrett
with
the
kind
of
love
by
which
the
world
is
saved
past
all
loss
and
forsaking
past
loneliness
and
longing
there
was
something
which
had
stirred
in
me
which
would
never
waken
to
a
lighter
occasion
and
whether
great
love
like
that
is
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
us
or
the
most
unusual
it
had
placed
me
forever
beyond
the
reach
of
futility
and
cheapness
all
this
was
several
years
ago
jerry
and
i
are
the
best
of
friends
and
i
am
far
too
busy
a
woman
to
miss
out
of
my
life
anything
pauline
mills
could
have
contributed
to
it
besides
i
am
very
much
taken
up
with
my
nieces
and
nephews
forester
oldest
boy
shows
a
creditable
talent
for
the
stage
and
i
have
him
at
school
here
where
i
can
watch
him
i
shall
try
him
out
on
the
road
next
summer
effie
husband
is
in
the
legislature
now
and
effie
looks
to
see
him
governor
i
am
very
fond
of
my
sister
we
grow
together
i
owe
it
to
her
to
have
found
ways
of
making
things
easier
for
women
who
must
tread
my
path
of
work
and
loneliness
it
is
partly
at
her
suggestion
that
i
have
written
this
book
for
effie
is
very
much
of
the
opinion
that
the
world
would
like
to
go
right
if
somebody
would
only
show
it
how
sarah
also
added
her
word
it
is
the
fact
of
your
telling
whether
they
believe
you
or
not
of
your
not
being
ashamed
to
tell
that
is
going
to
help
them
she
insists
at
any
rate
it
will
help
other
women
to
speak
out
what
they
think
unashamed
most
women
are
not
thinking
at
all
what
they
are
very
willing
to
be
thought
of
as
thinking
i
am
the
more
disposed
to
take
their
word
for
it
since
as
they
are
both
happy
they
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
the
fillip
of
discontent
sarah
left
the
stage
a
year
after
lawrence
death
to
marry
a
banker
from
troy
and
she
has
never
regretted
it
she
calls
her
oldest
girl
olivia
it
is
the
sane
and
sympathetic
contact
with
the
common
destiny
which
i
get
at
her
house
and
my
sister
that
keeps
me
from
the
resort
of
successive
and
inconsequent
passions
such
as
fill
the
void
in
the
lives
of
too
many
women
who
are
under
the
necessity
of
producing
daily
the
materials
of
fire
but
you
must
not
understand
me
to
blame
women
for
taking
that
path
when
so
many
are
closed
to
them
have
they
been
told
immemorially
that
loving
is
their
proper
function
their
only
one
last
year
i
walked
in
a
suffrage
parade
because
effie
wrote
me
that
it
was
my
duty
and
the
swing
of
it
the
banners
flying
the
proud
music
set
gates
wide
for
me
on
fields
of
new
inspiring
experience
all
the
paths
that
lead
to
the
shining
destiny
why
should
women
walk
in
them
i
should
think
some
of
them
might
lead
less
frequently
to
bramble
and
morass
and
after
all
said
jerry
a
day
or
two
ago
when
i
had
read
him
some
pages
of
my
book
you
have
only
told
your
own
story
you
have
found
out
why
all
the
rest
of
us
run
so
afoul
of
personal
disaster
we
i
mean
who
as
you
say
nourish
the
world
toward
the
larger
expectation
and
after
all
said
i
what
is
an
artist
but
a
specialist
in
human
experience
and
how
can
we
find
out
how
the
world
is
made
except
by
falling
afoul
of
it
if
when
we
fall
we
did
pull
the
others
down
with
us
i
willing
to
learn
but
why
should
others
have
to
pay
so
heavily
for
my
schooling
where
the
justice
in
making
us
so
that
we
ca
do
without
loving
and
then
not
let
us
be
happy
in
it
i
do
believe
it
is
the
loving
that
is
wrong
it
is
the
other
things
that
are
tied
up
with
it
and
taken
for
granted
must
go
with
loving
that
we
can
get
on
with
marriage
you
mean
not
exactly
living
in
one
place
and
by
a
particular
pattern
thinking
that
you
are
married
you
have
to
leave
off
this
and
take
up
that
which
you
would
think
of
doing
for
any
other
reason
you
mean
i
know
he
nodded
my
wife
was
always
wanting
me
to
do
this
and
that
on
the
ground
that
it
was
what
married
people
ought
and
i
could
see
where
it
led
or
why
it
was
important
but
what
if
it
should
turn
out
that
the
others
are
wrong
and
we
are
right
about
it
oh
i
think
we
are
wrong
people
like
us
are
after
the
truth
of
life
and
marriage
is
the
one
thing
that
society
wo
take
the
trouble
to
learn
the
truth
about
my
baby
you
know
i
lost
him
because
i
know
how
to
take
care
of
him
and
there
was
nobody
at
hand
who
knew
much
more
than
i
but
effie
last
baby
came
before
its
time
and
they
saved
it
by
science
by
knowing
what
and
how
why
ca
there
be
a
right
way
like
that
about
marriage
and
somebody
to
discover
it
then
where
would
we
come
in
after
it
was
all
found
out
if
we
are
the
experimentors
oh
there
be
other
fields
why
should
it
be
that
when
we
have
found
out
our
relation
to
the
physical
world
we
are
finding
it
you
know
radioactivity
and
laws
of
falling
bodies
go
on
finding
out
the
law
of
our
relations
to
one
another
and
when
we
found
that
out
then
there
all
the
heavenly
host
we
have
to
find
out
how
to
get
on
with
them
and
in
the
meantime
we
are
spoiling
a
lot
of
people
lives
because
we
ca
get
on
with
one
another
he
broke
off
suddenly
my
wife
is
married
again
i
do
know
if
i
told
you
ah
then
you
have
quite
spoiled
her
life
she
has
another
chance
and
the
children
he
had
been
very
fond
of
them
i
knew
i
have
done
so
much
with
my
own
life
that
i
insist
on
controlling
theirs
you
done
wonders
i
assured
him
jerry
honest
do
you
mind
it
so
much
not
having
a
wife
and
family
oh
lord
yes
olivia
i
need
a
wife
the
same
as
a
man
needs
a
watch
to
keep
the
time
of
life
for
me
he
faced
me
with
a
swift
sharp
scrutiny
honest
do
you
mind
sometimes
i
admitted
when
i
think
of
what
coming
when
i
act
any
more
you
be
leading
them
all
still
when
you
are
seventy
you
do
better
every
season
he
threw
away
his
cigar
and
came
and
stood
before
me
preening
his
raven
wing
which
now
had
a
little
streak
of
white
in
it
olivia
what
the
matter
with
you
and
me
being
married
we
get
on
like
everything
there
more
to
it
than
that
jerry
being
in
love
you
mean
well
i
do
know
that
i
would
stick
at
a
little
thing
like
that
he
was
looking
down
at
me
with
an
effect
of
humour
which
i
was
glad
to
see
covered
a
real
anxiety
about
my
answer
i
been
in
love
lots
of
times
i
been
mad
about
several
women
i
do
feel
that
way
about
you
and
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
but
if
wanting
you
is
loving
if
worrying
about
you
when
you
are
quite
up
to
yourself
and
being
proud
of
you
when
you
are
if
liking
to
be
with
you
and
wanting
to
read
my
manuscripts
to
you
the
minute
i
written
them
if
owing
you
more
than
i
owe
any
other
woman
and
being
glad
to
owe
it
is
loving
you
why
i
guess
i
love
you
enough
for
all
practical
purposes
what
would
tottie
lockwood
say
or
is
it
dottie
miss
lockwood
was
jerry
latest
interest
at
the
winter
garden
oh
she
is
in
a
position
to
say
anything
it
only
vanity
on
her
part
and
the
lack
of
anything
to
do
on
mine
there
be
no
time
for
totties
if
you
married
me
jerry
since
you
asked
me
i
suppose
you
know
that
i
that
i
he
put
up
an
arresting
hand
i
guessed
there
is
anything
you
need
to
tell
me
and
i
an
altogether
clean
record
myself
but
i
want
you
to
know
olivia
that
there
was
never
anything
in
my
case
that
you
could
take
exception
to
so
long
as
my
wife
was
with
me
i
could
make
her
believe
it
but
true
except
of
course
that
i
was
a
fool
i
hope
i
done
with
that
i
want
you
to
be
a
bit
foolish
about
me
jerry
that
is
if
i
make
up
my
mind
to
it
i
had
to
defend
myself
against
the
encouragement
he
got
out
of
my
admission
but
jerry
when
did
you
begin
to
think
about
what
you
just
said
about
marrying
you
ever
since
that
time
i
went
down
to
your
place
when
that
chichester
girl
when
i
would
take
her
place
a
merely
well
suppose
i
had
suppose
i
had
been
what
the
chichester
girl
would
would
you
still
have
wanted
to
marry
me
i
would
not
admit
to
myself
why
i
had
asked
that
question
i
do
know
olivia
men
do
you
know
not
often
but
i
want
to
marry
you
now
i
want
it
greatly
i
held
him
off
still
trying
to
get
my
own
experience
in
shape
where
i
could
leave
it
behind
me
such
affairs
never
turn
out
well
do
they
hardly
ever
i
believe
unless
you
turn
them
into
marriage
i
hazarded
you
know
he
conjectured
i
a
notion
that
the
kind
of
loving
that
goes
to
making
such
affairs
ca
be
turned
into
marriage
very
easily
it
a
kind
of
subconscious
knowledge
of
their
unfitness
that
keeps
us
from
turning
them
into
marriage
in
the
first
place
i
wonder
he
let
me
be
for
the
moment
revolving
many
things
in
my
mind
it
would
be
the
vision
and
the
dream
jerry
you
and
i
well
what
of
it
it
might
be
something
better
something
neither
of
us
ever
had
really
it
would
be
company
no
i
never
had
it
i
remembered
how
blank
the
issue
of
my
work
had
been
to
helmeth
garrett
well
then
we
have
years
of
work
in
us
yet
i
buy
polatkin
out
of
the
theatre
he
was
going
off
at
a
tangent
of
what
we
might
do
together
but
i
had
thought
of
something
more
pertinent
we
might
solve
the
problem
of
how
to
keep
our
art
and
still
be
happy
we
might
he
was
looking
down
on
me
with
great
content
but
quite
soberly
tell
me
olivia
suppose
we
should
even
with
the
unhappiness
with
all
you
have
been
through
would
you
rather
be
what
you
are
or
like
the
others
we
were
silent
as
we
thought
back
across
the
years
together
there
was
very
little
by
this
time
that
we
did
not
know
of
one
another
no
i
said
at
last
if
being
different
meant
being
like
the
others
i
not
choose
to
have
it
any
different
