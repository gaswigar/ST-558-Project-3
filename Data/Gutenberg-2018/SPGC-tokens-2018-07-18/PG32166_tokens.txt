shan
bullock
who
needs
no
introduction
to
those
who
read
irish
books
has
done
no
better
work
than
in
this
tribute
to
one
of
the
noblest
irishmen
ulster
has
produced
in
modern
times
i
refer
not
only
to
the
literary
merits
of
andrews
which
speak
for
themselves
but
rather
to
the
true
insight
with
which
he
has
fulfilled
the
precise
purpose
held
in
view
by
those
who
asked
him
to
write
this
little
memorial
volume
what
that
purpose
was
must
be
known
in
order
that
the
story
itself
and
the
manner
of
the
telling
may
be
fully
appreciated
the
book
was
written
at
the
request
of
a
few
irishmen
myself
among
them
who
work
together
in
a
movement
which
seeks
to
develop
agriculture
and
generally
to
improve
the
condition
of
our
rural
communities
we
are
deeply
interested
in
the
great
achievements
of
ulster
industry
because
we
hold
strongly
that
the
prosperity
of
our
country
depends
largely
upon
the
mutual
understanding
and
the
of
effort
between
the
two
great
economic
interests
into
which
the
irish
in
common
with
most
civilised
peoples
are
divided
for
this
consummation
ireland
needs
in
our
opinion
industrial
leaders
with
a
broader
conception
of
the
life
of
the
country
as
a
whole
for
such
leaders
we
naturally
look
more
especially
those
of
us
whose
eyes
are
turning
towards
the
westering
sun
to
the
younger
men
among
these
none
seemed
to
us
so
ideally
fitted
to
give
practical
expression
to
our
hopes
as
thomas
andrews
thus
it
was
the
sense
of
the
great
loss
the
country
had
sustained
which
set
us
thinking
how
the
life
of
the
shipbuilder
who
had
died
so
nobly
could
be
given
its
due
place
in
the
history
of
our
the
lesson
of
that
life
could
be
handed
down
to
the
builders
of
ships
and
of
other
things
in
the
ireland
of
our
dreams
the
project
having
so
originated
the
proper
treatment
of
the
subject
had
to
be
determined
unquestionably
thomas
andrews
was
a
hero
the
wise
bishop
berkeley
has
said
every
man
by
consulting
his
own
heart
may
easily
know
whether
he
is
or
is
not
a
patriot
but
it
is
not
easy
for
the
a
man
can
not
thus
know
whether
he
is
or
is
not
a
hero
both
he
and
the
bystander
must
wait
for
the
occasion
to
arise
and
the
opportunities
for
exhibiting
heroism
are
as
rare
and
perilous
as
those
for
exhibiting
patriotism
are
common
and
safe
to
thomas
andrews
the
supreme
test
in
circumstances
demanding
almost
superhuman
fortitude
and
here
was
not
the
wild
excitement
of
battle
to
sustain
him
death
had
to
be
faced
calmly
in
order
that
whom
he
must
not
even
bid
live
and
so
in
his
last
hour
we
see
this
brave
strong
capable
and
lovable
man
displaying
not
only
heroism
but
every
quality
which
had
exalted
him
in
the
regard
of
his
fellows
and
endeared
him
to
all
who
had
worked
and
lived
with
him
this
is
the
verdict
of
his
countrymen
now
that
the
facts
of
that
terrible
disaster
are
fully
known
yet
it
was
far
from
our
purpose
to
have
the
tragedy
of
the
written
with
thomas
andrews
as
the
hero
we
deemed
it
better
to
place
the
bare
facts
before
some
writer
of
repute
not
one
of
his
personal
friends
and
ask
him
to
tell
in
simple
language
the
plain
tale
of
his
life
so
far
as
it
could
be
gleaned
from
printed
and
written
records
from
his
family
friends
and
employers
above
all
from
those
pals
as
he
liked
to
call
whom
this
book
is
most
fittingly
dedicated
the
story
thus
pieced
together
would
be
chiefly
concerned
with
his
work
for
his
work
was
his
life
to
thomas
andrews
the
hero
then
we
did
not
propose
to
raise
a
monument
to
his
memory
a
fine
memorial
hall
is
to
be
built
and
endowed
in
his
native
comber
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
and
district
and
his
friends
while
he
will
be
associated
in
memorials
elsewhere
with
those
who
died
nobly
in
the
wreck
these
tributes
will
serve
to
remind
us
how
he
died
but
will
not
tell
us
how
he
lived
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
short
memoir
to
give
a
fairly
complete
record
of
his
parentage
his
home
his
education
his
pleasures
his
tastes
and
his
thoughts
so
far
as
they
are
known
upon
things
which
count
in
the
lives
of
peoples
the
family
and
all
from
whom
information
was
sought
responded
most
cordially
to
our
wishes
there
remained
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
writer
who
could
tell
the
story
of
thomas
andrews
the
man
as
we
wished
it
to
be
told
in
belfast
a
memorial
to
thomas
andrews
and
the
other
belfast
men
who
died
in
the
wreck
has
been
generously
subscribed
to
by
the
citizens
and
by
the
queen
s
island
workers
he
is
also
included
amongst
those
to
whom
a
similar
memorial
is
to
be
erected
in
southampton
the
reform
club
in
belfast
is
honouring
his
memory
with
a
tablet
for
such
a
task
it
was
decided
that
if
he
could
be
induced
to
undertake
it
the
right
man
was
shan
bullock
he
is
an
ulsterman
a
writer
of
tales
of
ulster
life
distinguished
among
other
irish
books
by
their
sincerity
and
unequalled
understanding
of
the
ulster
character
while
other
irish
writers
of
imagination
and
genius
have
used
irish
life
to
express
their
own
temperament
shan
bullock
has
devoted
his
great
literary
ability
almost
entirely
to
the
patient
living
and
sincere
study
of
what
ulster
really
is
in
itself
as
a
community
of
men
and
women
it
is
true
that
his
stories
are
of
rural
and
agricultural
communities
while
the
scene
is
now
laid
chiefly
in
a
great
centre
of
manufacturing
industry
but
in
bullock
s
studies
it
is
always
the
human
factor
that
predominates
one
feels
while
reading
one
of
his
tales
that
he
loves
to
look
upon
a
man
especially
an
ulster
man
here
was
the
ideal
historian
of
the
life
of
thomas
andrews
it
fell
to
me
to
approach
bullock
i
induced
him
to
go
and
see
the
family
having
arranged
with
them
to
bring
him
into
touch
with
the
authorities
at
the
island
works
who
were
to
show
him
round
and
introduce
him
to
many
who
knew
our
friend
he
promised
me
that
he
would
look
over
all
the
material
out
of
which
the
story
could
be
pieced
together
and
that
if
he
found
that
it
gripped
him
and
became
a
labour
of
love
he
would
undertake
it
the
story
did
as
the
reader
will
see
grip
him
and
grip
him
hard
and
in
telling
it
bullock
has
rendered
the
greatest
of
all
his
services
to
lovers
of
truth
told
about
ireland
by
irish
writers
it
will
now
i
think
be
clear
why
thomas
andrews
has
notwithstanding
his
noble
end
been
represented
as
the
plain
ulster
boy
growing
into
the
exemplary
and
finally
the
heroic
ulster
man
that
we
knew
we
see
him
ever
doing
what
his
hand
found
to
do
and
doing
it
with
his
might
our
author
rightly
as
i
think
makes
no
attempt
to
present
him
as
a
public
man
for
this
captain
of
industry
in
the
making
was
wholly
absorbed
in
his
duties
to
the
great
firm
he
served
none
the
less
i
am
convinced
that
the
public
side
of
the
man
would
not
long
have
remained
knows
but
that
this
very
year
would
have
called
him
forth
he
had
to
my
personal
knowledge
the
right
public
spirit
concentration
upon
the
work
in
hand
prevented
his
active
participation
in
public
affairs
but
his
mastery
over
complicated
mechanical
power
to
use
to
organise
bodies
of
men
in
their
use
would
not
i
believe
have
failed
him
if
he
had
come
to
deal
with
the
mechanics
of
the
nation
these
may
be
fruitless
speculations
now
and
bullock
wisely
leaves
us
to
draw
our
own
conclusions
as
to
the
eminence
to
which
thomas
andrews
might
have
attained
had
his
life
been
spared
abundant
proof
of
the
immense
influence
he
might
have
exercised
is
furnished
in
the
eloquently
sincere
grief
which
pervades
the
letters
of
condolence
that
poured
into
the
home
of
the
parents
at
comber
when
it
was
known
that
they
had
lost
their
distinguished
son
they
seven
hundred
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
ranging
from
a
duke
to
a
pauper
in
a
workhouse
in
one
of
these
letters
too
intimate
to
publish
a
near
relative
pays
to
the
dead
shipbuilder
a
pathetically
simple
tribute
with
which
i
may
well
leave
to
the
reader
mr
bullock
s
tale
of
a
noble
life
and
heroic
death

tom
was
we
are
told
a
healthy
energetic
bonny
child
and
grew
into
a
handsome
plucky
and
lovable
his
home
training
was
of
the
wisest
and
of
a
kind
one
thinks
not
commonly
given
to
ulster
boys
in
those
more
austere
times
of
his
youth
no
one
writes
his
brother
john
knew
better
than
tom
how
much
he
owed
to
that
healthy
home
life
in
which
we
were
brought
up
we
were
never
otherwise
treated
than
with
more
than
kindness
and
devotion
and
we
learned
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
rather
by
example
than
by
to
tom
his
father
then
and
always
was
as
an
elder
brother
full
of
understanding
and
sympathy
nor
did
his
mother
even
to
the
end
seem
to
him
other
than
a
sister
whose
life
was
as
his
own
he
and
his
elder
brother
john
were
inseparable
comrades
there
among
the
fields
of
comber
and
in
their
beautiful
home
with
its
old
lawn
and
gardens
its
avenue
winding
past
banks
of
rhododendrons
the
farm
behind
outside
the
great
mill
humming
busily
and
in
front
the
gleam
of
strangford
lough
both
father
and
mother
being
advocates
of
temperance
encouraged
their
lads
to
abstain
from
tobacco
and
strong
drink
and
to
this
end
their
good
mother
offered
to
give
a
tempting
prize
to
such
of
her
sons
as
could
on
their
birthday
say
they
had
so
abstained
tom
and
each
of
his
brothers
not
only
claimed
his
prize
but
continued
throughout
life
to
act
upon
the
principles
it
signalised
doubtless
at
times
being
human
boys
they
fell
into
mischief
but
only
once
their
father
states
was
bodily
punishment
given
to
either
and
then
as
fate
willed
it
he
boxed
the
ear
of
the
wrong
boy
quite
early
young
tom
like
many
another
lad
developed
a
fondness
for
boats
and
because
of
his
manifest
skill
in
the
making
of
these
he
gained
among
his
friends
the
nickname
of
in
other
respects
also
the
man
who
was
to
be
showed
himself
in
the
boy
he
had
a
beautiful
way
with
children
he
loved
animals
of
every
kind
and
had
over
them
such
influence
that
they
would
follow
him
and
come
to
his
call
still
at
ardara
in
shelter
of
the
hedge
you
may
see
his
nine
hives
of
bees
among
which
he
used
to
spend
many
happy
hours
and
to
which
in
later
times
he
devoted
much
of
his
leisure
once
his
mother
will
tell
you
spending
a
whole
winter
s
a
hunting
day
too
his
workers
to
and
fro
between
hive
and
kitchen
in
his
cap
for
horses
he
had
a
passion
and
particularly
for
the
shetland
pony
given
to
him
one
birthday
the
fiercest
brute
yielded
to
his
quiet
mastery
he
never
used
whip
or
spur
and
in
time
he
was
known
as
one
of
the
straightest
and
most
fearless
riders
to
hounds
in
county
down
until
the
age
of
eleven
he
was
educated
privately
by
a
tutor
but
in
september
he
became
a
student
at
the
royal
academical
institution
same
institution
through
which
some
years
previously
his
father
and
his
uncle
then
pirrie
had
passed
there
he
showed
no
special
aptitudes
being
fonder
apparently
of
games
than
of
study
and
not
yet
having
developed
those
powers
of
industry
for
which
soon
he
became
notable
in
the
institution
however
was
no
more
popular
boy
both
with
masters
and
schoolfellows
he
excelled
at
cricket
one
is
glad
to
know
and
at
all
manly
sports
even
then
we
are
told
generosity
and
a
fine
sympathy
were
prominent
traits
in
his
character
he
was
always
happy
writes
a
playmate
and
showed
a
developing
power
of
impressing
everyone
with
his
honesty
and
simplicity
of
wherever
he
went
tom
carried
his
own
sunshine
all
were
fond
of
him
one
can
see
him
returning
with
his
brother
from
school
big
strong
and
perhaps
with
some
premonition
of
what
the
future
had
in
store
lingering
sometimes
near
the
station
doorway
to
watch
the
great
ships
rising
above
the
island
yard
close
by
and
to
listen
for
a
minute
to
the
hammers
beating
some
great
vessel
into
shape
and
whilst
he
stands
there
grave
and
thoughtful
for
a
minute
one
may
write
here
the
judgment
of
his
parents
upon
him
he
never
caused
us
a
moment
s
anxiety
in
his
ii
when
he
was
sixteen
on
the
may
tom
left
school
and
as
a
premium
apprentice
entered
the
shipyard
of
harland
wolff
in
one
important
respect
the
date
of
his
entry
may
be
accounted
fortunate
for
about
that
time
chiefly
through
the
enterprise
of
the
white
star
company
in
the
matter
of
constructing
a
fleet
of
giant
ships
for
the
atlantic
service
great
developments
were
imminent
if
not
already
begun
in
the
shipping
world
to
a
boy
of
sixteen
however
the
change
from
the
comforts
of
home
and
the
comparative
freedom
of
to
the
stern
discipline
of
the
yards
must
have
been
exacting
it
was
work
now
and
plenty
of
it

and
winter
day
in

out
the
hardest
he
could
do
at
the
hardest
could
be
given
him
he
was
to
be
tested
to
the
full
with
characteristic
wisdom
pirrie
had
decided
that
no
favour
whatever
was
to
be
shown
the
boy
on
the
score
of
relationship
by
his
own
efforts
and
abilities
he
must
make
his
way
profiting
by
no
more
than
the
inspiration
of
his
uncle
s
example
and
if
he
failed
well
that
too
was
a
way
many
another
had
gone
before
him
but
tom
was
not
of
the
breed
that
fails
he
took
to
his
work
instantly
and
with
enthusiasm
distance
from
home
necessitated
his
living
through
the
workaday
week
in
belfast
every
morning
he
rose
at
ten
minutes
to
five
and
was
at
work
in
the
yard
punctually
by
six
o
clock
his
first
three
months
were
spent
in
the
joiner
s
shop
the
next
month
with
the
cabinet
makers
the
two
following
months
working
in
ships
there
followed
two
months
in
the
main
store

with

with

with

a
long
spell
of
eighteen
months
in
the
drawing
office
completed
his
term
of
five
years
as
an
apprentice
illustration
harland
and
wolff
s
turbine
erecting
shop
throughout
that
long
ordeal
tom
inspired
everyone
who
saw
him
workmen
foremen
managers
and
those
in
higher
authority
as
much
by
the
force
of
his
personal
character
as
by
his
qualities
of
industry
without
doubt
here
was
one
destined
to
success
he
was
thorough
to
the
smallest
detail
he
mastered
everything
with
the
ease
of
one
in
love
with
his
task
we
have
a
picture
of
him
drawn
by
a
comrade
in
his
moleskin
trousers
and
linen
jacket
and
instinctively
regarded
by
his
as
their
leader
friend
and
adviser
in
all
matters
of
shipyard
lore
and
tradition
he
was
some
steps
ahead
of
me
in
his
progress
through
the
yard
the
account
goes
on
so
i
saw
him
only
at
the
breakfast
and
luncheon
hours
but
i
can
remember
how
encouraging
his
cheery
optimism
and
unfailing
friendship
were
to
one
who
found
the
path
at
times
far
from
easy
and
the
demands
on
one
s
patience
almost
more
than
could
be
many
a
workman
too
with
whom
he
wrought
at
that
time
will
tell
you
and
with
a
regret
at
his
untimely
loss
as
pathetic
as
it
is
sincere
how
faithful
he
was
how
upstanding
generous
he
would
work
at
full
pressure
in
order
to
gain
time
to
assist
an
old
workman
in
pulling
up
his
he
would
share
his
lunch
with
a
mate
toil
half
the
night
in
relief
of
a
who
had
been
overcome
by
sickness
or
would
plunge
gallantly
into
a
flooded
hold
to
stop
a
leakage
it
seemed
his
delight
writes
a
foreman
to
make
those
around
him
happy
his
was
ever
the
friendly
greeting
and
the
warm
handshake
and
kind
such
testimony
is
worth
pages
of
outside
eulogy
and
testimony
of
its
kind
from
all
sorts
and
conditions
exists
in
abundance
the
long
day
s
work
over
at
the
island
many
a
young
man
would
have
preferred
and
naturally
perhaps
to
spend
his
evenings
pleasurably
not
so
tom
andrews
knowing
the
necessity
if
real
success
were
to
be
attained
of
perfecting
himself
on
the
technical
as
much
as
on
the
practical
side
of
his
profession
and
perhaps
having
a
desire
also
to
make
good
what
he
considered
wasted
opportunities
at
school
he
pursued
during
the
five
years
of
his
apprenticeship
and
afterwards
too
a
rigid
course
of
night
studies
in
this
way
gaining
an
excellent
knowledge
of
machine
and
freehand
drawing
of
applied
mechanics
and
the
theory
of
naval
architecture
so
assiduously
did
he
study
that
seldom
was
he
in
bed
before
eleven
o
clock
he
read
no
novels
wasted
no
time
over
newspapers
and
hardly
could
be
persuaded
by
his
friends
to
give
them
his
company
for
an
occasional
evening
his
weekly
game
of
cricket
or
hockey
with
a
day
s
hunting
now
and
then
or
an
afternoon
s
yachting
on
the
lough
gave
him
all
the
relaxation
he
could
permit
himself
and
by
when
his
term
of
apprenticeship
ended
the
thrill
of
hitting
a
ball
over
the
boundary
and
tom
was
a
mighty
hitter
who
felt
the
thrill
often
was
experienced
with
less
and
still
less
frequency
whilst
sometimes
now
and
more
frequently
as
time
went
on
the
joy
of
spending
sunday
with
his
dear
folk
at
comber
had
to
be
foregone
even
when
the
presidency
of
the
northern
cricket
union
was
pressed
upon
him
such
were
the
stern
claims
of
duty
that
the
pleasure
of
accepting
it
had
ruthlessly
to
be
sacrificed
what
grit
what
zest
and
sense
of
duty
the
he
was
no
have
had
so
to
labour
and
yet
to
thrive
gloriously
perfect
health
his
sound
physique
his
sunny
nature
and
strict
adherence
to
the
principles
of
temperance
encouraged
by
his
mother
helped
him
to
attain
fine
manhood
during
the
period
of
his
apprenticeship
he
was
up
to
time
on
every
morning
of
the
five
years
except
of
his
doings
on
that
fateful
morning
a
story
is
told
which
better
perhaps
than
any
other
throws
light
upon
his
character
it
was
a
good
custom
of
the
firm
to
award
a
gold
watch
to
every
pupil
who
ended
his
term
without
being
late
once
that
morning
tom
s
clock
had
failed
to
ring
its
alarm
at
the
usual
time
so
despite
every
endeavour
the
boy
could
not
reach
the
gates
before
ten
minutes
past
six
he
might
by
losing
the
whole
day
and
making
some
excuse
have
escaped
penalty
instead
he
waited
outside
the
gates
until
eight
o
clock
and
went
in
to
work
at
the
breakfast
hour
one
other
story
relating
to
this
period
is
told
by
his
mother
it
too
reveals
distinctive
points
of
character
on
an
occasion
tom
with
several
went
on
a
walking
tour
during
the
easter
holidays
over
the
ards
peninsula
crossing
strangford
lough
at
portaferry
they
visited
john
s
point
the
most
easterly
part
of
ireland
then
finding
the
tide
favourable
crossed
the
sands
from
ballykinler
to
carrying
the
youngest
of
the
party
on
his
back
through
a
deep
intervening
stretch
of
thence
by
way
of
newcastle
proceeded
across
the
mountains
to
rostrevor
in
their
hotel
at
rostrevor
the
boys
during
an
excess
of
high
spirits
broke
the
rail
of
a
bedstead
whereupon
tom
assuming
responsibility
told
the
landlady
that
he
would
bear
the
expense
of
repairing
the
break
she
answered
that
in
her
hotel
they
did
not
keep
patched
beds
consequently
would
be
troubling
him
for
the
cost
of
a
new
one
if
so
the
old
one
belongs
to
me
said
tom
provided
you
ll
be
taking
it
away
countered
the
dame
the
boy
argued
no
further
but
finding
presently
through
a
friendly
chambermaid
an
old
charwoman
who
said
her
sick
husband
would
rejoice
in
the
luxury
of
the
bedstead
he
offered
to
mend
it
and
give
it
to
her
ah
but
wouldn
t
it
be
more
than
my
place
is
worth
child
dear
she
answered
for
the
like
of
me
to
be
taking
it
from
the
never
mind
that
said
tom
give
me
your
address
borrow
a
screw
driver
and
i
ll
see
to
so
he
and
his
companions
having
roughly
repaired
the
rail
took
the
bedstead
to
pieces
and
applauded
by
the
visitors
carried
it
to
the
street
a
tram
conductor
allowed
them
to
load
their
burden
on
an
end
of
his
car
soon
they
reached
the
woman
s
home
bore
in
the
bedstead
set
it
up
in
the
humble
room
raised
the
old
man
and
his
straw
mattress
upon
it
from
the
floor
made
him
comfortable
and
dowered
with
all
the
blessings
the
old
couple
could
invoke
upon
them
went
away
happy
iii
so
much
impressed
was
the
firm
with
tom
s
industry
and
capacity
that
soon
after
the
time
of
his
entering
the
drawing
office
in
november
he
was
entrusted
with
the
discharge
of
responsible
duties
it
is
on
record
that
in
february
he
was
given
the
supervision
of
construction
work
on
the
that
in
november
of
the
same
year
he
represented
the
firm
to
its
entire
satisfaction
and
his
own
credit
on
the
trials
of
the
white
star
liner
whilst
immediately
following
the
end
of
his
apprenticeship
in
may
he
helped
the
shipyard
manager
to
examine
the
went
to
liverpool
and
reported
on
the
damage
done
to
the
and
in
november
discussed
with
the
general
manager
and
shipyard
manager
the
notes
in
connection
with
the
renovation
of
the
famous
liner
still
capable
after
years
on
the
atlantic
service
of
making
record
passages
but
now
crippled
through
being
overladen
with
ice
at
new
york
in
he
was
years
old
a
man
and
well
launched
on
his
great
career
it
is
not
necessary
and
scarcely
possible
to
follow
andrews
with
any
closeness
as
rapidly
step
by
step
he
climbed
the
ladder
already
scaled
with
such
amazing
success
by
pirrie
the
record
of
his
career
is
written
in
the
wonderful
story
of
the
queen
s
island
yard
through
all
its
developments
onward
from
and
in
the
story
of
the
many
famous
ships
repaired
and
built
during
the
period
the
remarkable
engineering
feat
of
lengthening
the
and
the
by
dividing
the
vessels
and
inserting
a
section
amidships
the
reconstruction
of
the
after
its
disaster
at
perim
and
of
the
following
its
wreck
on
the
manacles
in
these
operations
covering
roughly
the
years
andrews
first
as
an
outside
manager
and
subsequently
as
head
of
the
repair
department
took
a
distinguished
part
he
was
growing
widening
knowledge
maturing
capacity
and
both
by
the
staff
and
by
those
in
touch
with
the
yard
he
became
recognised
as
what
the
watching
crowd
terms
not
unhappily
a
coming
man
having
made
his
mark
in
the
repair
department
andrews
was
next
to
prove
himself
on
construction
work
prior
to
the
launch
of
the
in
and
whilst
engaged
in
the
reconstruction
operations
already
mentioned
he
had
also
rendered
good
service
at
the
building
of
ships
for
many
of
the
great
steamship
lines
but
it
was
perhaps
with
the
building
of
the
when
he
became
manager
of
construction
work
that
the
path
of
his
career
took
him
swiftly
up
into
prominence
the
duty
of
supervising
all
the
structural
details
of
the
vessel
brought
him
into
close
practical
touch
with
the
drawing
office
the
moulding
loft
the
platers
shops
and
all
the
other
departments
through
which
he
had
passed
as
an
apprentice
imposed
upon
his
young
shoulders
great
responsibilities
tested
his
capacity
for
handling
men
put
him
in
constant
and
intimate
view
of
his
employers
widened
his
relations
with
owners
contractors
directors
managers
opened
to
him
not
only
the
life
of
the
yard
but
the
vast
outer
life
of
the
shipping
and
commercial
world
and
in
a
hundred
other
respects
helped
towards
his
development
as
a
shipbuilder
and
a
man
now
he
had
opportunity
to
apply
his
knowledge
and
experience
to
express
in
tangible
form
his
genius
the
great
ship
rising
there
below
the
gantries
to
the
accompaniment
of
such
clang
and
was
his
part
of
him
to
the
task
one
of
the
noblest
surely
done
by
men
he
gave
himself
unsparingly
every
bit
of
him
might
and
main
and
his
success
great
as
it
was
had
the
greater
acclaim
because
in
achieving
it
he
worked
not
for
personal
success
but
for
success
in
his
work
that
was
the
man
s
way
his
job
first
and
last
and
always
the
names
alone
of
all
the
ships
in
whose
building
andrews
had
a
hand
more
or
less
as
designer
constructor
supervisor
and
adviser
would
fill
this
page
the
the
the
the
the
the
and
the
the
the
of
which
recently
we
have
heard
so
much
those
are
a
few
of
them
the
and
the
those
are
two
more
their
names
are
as
familiar
to
us
as
those
of
our
friends
we
have
some
of
us
seen
the
great
ships
on
whose
bows
they
are
inscribed
perhaps
sailed
in
them
or
watched
anxiously
for
their
arrival
at
some
port
of
the
world
well
wherever
they
sail
now
or
lie
they
have
upon
them
the
impress
of
tom
andrews
hand
and
brain
and
with
one
of
them
the
last
and
finest
of
all
he
himself
gloriously
perished
there
are
many
others
less
known
perhaps
but
carrying
the
flag
no
less
proudly
upon
the
seven
seas
for
whose
design
and
construction
andrews
was
in
some
measure
often
in
great
measure
responsible
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
and
the
rest
it
is
a
splendid
record
lord
pirrie
may
well
be
proud
of
it
and
ulster
too
both
we
know
are
proud
of
the
man
who
so
devotedly
helped
to
make
it
the
work
of
building
all
those
ships
and
so
many
more
from
the
to
the
covered
a
period
of
some
thirteen
years
and
in
that
period
andrews
gained
such
advancement
as
his
services
to
the
firm
deserved
in
he
became
assistant
chief
designer
and
in
the
year
following
was
promoted
to
be
head
of
the
designing
department
under
lord
pirrie
his
age
then
was
an
age
at
which
most
men
are
beginning
their
career
but
he
already
had
behind
him
what
may
seem
the
work
and
experience
of
a
strenuous
lifetime
when
first
i
knew
andrews
writes
one
who
knew
him
intimately
and
later
was
closely
associated
with
him
in
his
work
he
was
a
young
man
but
young
as
he
was
to
him
were
entrusted
the
most
important
and
responsible
direct
supervision
of
constructing
the
largest
ships
built
in
the
yard
from
the
laying
of
their
keels
until
their
sailing
from
belfast
such
a
training
eminently
fitted
him
for
the
important
position
to
which
he
succeeded
in
that
of
chief
of
the
designing
department
for
one
so
young
the
position
involved
duties
that
taxed
him
to
the
full
to
superintend
the
construction
of
ships
like
the
and
was
a
great
achievement
but
at
the
age
of
to
be
chief
of
a
department
designing
leviathans
like
the
was
a
greater
one
still
how
well
he
rose
to
the
call
everyone
knows
no
task
was
too
heavy
and
none
too
light
for
him
to
grapple
with
successfully
he
seemed
endowed
with
boundless
energy
and
his
interest
in
his
work
was
others
who
knew
him
well
during
this
important
period
of
his
career
testify
in
the
like
manner
diligent
to
the
point
of
strenuousness
wrote
one
of
them
thinking
whilst
others
slept
reading
while
others
played
through
sheer
toil
and
ability
he
made
for
himself
a
position
that
few
of
his
years
attain
and
then
the
writer
whose
ideal
of
life
is
character
notes
approvingly
and
justly
that
andrews
worked
not
as
a
hireling
but
in
the
spirit
of
an
artist
whose
work
must
satisfy
his
own
exacting
conscience
those
boundless
energies
soon
were
given
wider
scope
early
in
the
was
finished
and
in
march
of
that
same
year
he
was
made
a
managing
director
of
the
firm
the
right
hon
carlisle
being
at
this
time
chairman
of
the
board
everyone
knows
or
can
judge
for
himself
what
were
the
duties
of
this
new
additional
position
rather
for
he
still
remained
chief
of
the
designing
what
in
such
a
huge
and
complicated
concern
as
the
island
works
the
duties
involved
briefly
we
may
summarise
them
a
knowledge
of
its
branches
equal
to
that
of
any
of
the
men
in
charge
of
them
the
supervising
these
combining
and
managing
them
so
that
all
might
smoothly
and
efficiently
work
to
the
one
great
end
assigned
the
keeping
abreast
with
the
latest
devices
in
appliances
with
the
newest
means
of
securing
economical
fitness
with
the
most
modern
discoveries
in
electrical
mechanical
and
marine
short
everything
relative
to
the
construction
and
equipment
of
modern
steamships
and
in
addition
all
the
numerous
and
delicate
duties
devolving
upon
him
as
lord
pirrie
s
assistant
furthermore
the
many
voyages
of
discovery
so
to
speak
which
he
made
as
representative
of
the
firm
thereby
we
are
told
by
one
with
whom
he
sailed
often
gaining
a
knowledge
of
sea
life
and
the
art
of
working
a
ship
unequalled
in
my
experience
by
anyone
not
by
profession
a
seafarer
and
lastly
his
many
inspections
of
and
elaborate
reports
upon
ships
and
business
works
together
with
his
survey
at
lord
pirrie
s
instance
of
the
harbours
of
ireland
canada
germany
and
elsewhere
it
seems
a
giant
s
task
even
to
us
poor
humdrum
mortals
toiling
meanly
on
office
stools
at
our
twopenny
enterprises
it
seems
more
than
a
giant
s
task
yet
andrews
shouldered
it
unweariedly
cheerily
joyfully
for
pure
love
of
the
task
one
sees
him
big
and
strong
a
bowler
hat
on
his
crown
grease
on
his
boots
and
the
pockets
of
his
blue
jacket
stuffed
with
plans
making
his
daily
round
of
the
yards
now
consulting
his
chief
now
conferring
with
a
foreman
now
interviewing
an
owner
now
poring
over
intricate
calculations
in
the
drawing
office
now
in
company
with
his
warm
friend
old
schoolfellow
and
george
cumming
of
the
engineering
department
superintending
the
hoisting
of
a
boiler
by
the
two
hundred
ton
crane
into
some
newly
launched
ship
by
a
wharf
or
he
runs
amok
through
a
their
admiration
be
it
heating
their
before
or
comes
unawares
upon
a
party
enjoying
a
stolen
smoke
below
a
and
having
spoken
his
mind
forcibly
accepts
with
a
smile
the
dismayed
sentinel
s
excuse
that
twasn
t
fair
to
catch
him
by
coming
like
that
into
the
tunnel
instead
of
by
the
way
he
was
or
he
kicks
a
red
hot
rivet
which
has
fallen
fifty
feet
from
an
upper
deck
missing
his
head
by
inches
and
strides
on
laughing
at
his
escape
or
he
calls
some
laggard
to
stern
account
promising
him
the
gate
double
quick
without
any
talk
next
time
or
he
lends
a
ready
hand
to
one
in
difficulties
or
just
in
time
saves
another
from
falling
down
a
hold
or
saying
that
married
men
s
lives
are
precious
orders
back
a
third
from
some
dangerous
place
and
himself
takes
the
risk
or
he
runs
into
the
drawing
office
with
a
hospital
note
and
a
gift
of
flowers
and
fruit
for
the
sick
wife
of
a
draughtsman
or
at
he
stands
by
a
ship
s
gangway
down
which
four
thousand
hungry
men
with
a
ninety
feet
drop
below
them
are
rushing
for
home
and
supper
and
with
voice
and
eye
controls
them
a
guard
rope
breaks
another
instant
and
there
may
be
grim
panic
on
the
gangway
but
his
great
voice
rings
out
stand
back
men
and
he
holds
them
as
in
a
leash
until
the
rope
is
made
good
again
all
in
the
day
s
work
those
and
a
thousand
other
incidents
which
men
treasure
in
the
island
and
if
you
are
tactful
will
reveal
to
you
in
their
slow
laconic
northern
way
he
has
been
in
the
yard
perhaps
since
four
or
five
o
six
for
a
certainty
at
seven
or
so
he
will
trudge
home
or
ride
in
a
tramcar
with
the
other
workers
to
sit
over
his
plans
or
his
books
well
into
the
night
one
recalls
a
day
not
long
ago
spent
most
of
it
in
tramping
over
the
island
works
guided
by
two
men
who
had
worked
for
many
years
with
andrews
and
who
like
others
we
saw
and
thousands
we
did
not
see
held
his
memory
almost
in
reverence
in
and
out
up
and
down
we
went
through
heat
and
rain
over
cobble
stones
and
tram
lines
now
stepping
on
planks
right
down
the
double
bottom
three
hundred
yards
long
from
which
was
soon
to
rise
the
successor
now
crouching
amongst
the
shores
sustaining
the
huge
bulk
of
another
giant
now
passing
in
silent
wonder
along
the
huge
cradles
and
ways
above
which
another
monster
stood
ready
for
launching
then
into
shop
after
shop
in
endless
succession
each
needing
a
day
s
journey
to
traverse
each
wonderfully
clean
and
ordered
and
all
full
of
wonders
boilers
as
tall
as
houses
shafts
a
boy
s
height
in
diameter
enormous
propellers
hanging
like
some
monstrous
sea
animal
in
chains
turbine
motors
on
which
workmen
clambered
as
upon
a
cliff
huge
lathes
pneumatic
hammers
and
quiet
machines
that
dealt
with
cold
steel
shearing
it
punching
it
planing
it
as
if
it
had
been
so
much
dinner
cheese
then
up
into
the
moulding
loft
large
enough
for
a
football
ground
and
its
floor
a
beautiful
maze
of
frame
lines
on
through
the
joiners
shops
with
their
tools
that
can
do
everything
but
speak
through
the
smiths
shops
with
their
long
rows
of
hearths
and
on
into
the
great
airy
building
so
full
of
interest
that
one
could
linger
in
it
for
a
week
where
an
army
of
cabinetmakers
are
fashioning
all
kinds
of
ship
s
furniture
then
across
into
the
central
power
station
daily
generating
enough
electricity
to
light
belfast
on
through
the
fine
arched
drawing
hall
where
the
spirit
of
tom
andrews
seemed
still
to
linger
and
into
his
office
where
often
he
sat
drafting
those
reports
so
exhaustively
minute
so
methodical
and
neatly
penned
which
now
have
such
pathetic
and
revealing
interest
lastly
after
such
long
journeying
out
to
a
wharf
and
over
a
great
ship
full
of
stir
and
clamour
and
as
thronged
with
workmen
as
soon
it
would
be
with
passengers
illustration
the
turning
shop
and
often
as
one
went
hour
after
hour
one
kept
asking
had
andrews
knowledge
of
this
and
this
and
that
yes
of
knew
everything
would
be
the
patient
answer
and
could
he
do
this
and
this
and
this
one
kept
on
he
could
do
anything
would
be
the
answer
even
how
to
drive
an
engine
and
how
to
rivet
a
plate
he
could
have
built
a
ship
himself
and
fitted
and
sailed
her
too
the
answer
we
got
and
then
as
one
dragged
wearily
towards
the
gateway
outside
which
you
will
remember
young
tom
waited
one
bitter
morning
disappointed
but
staunch
the
guide
noting
one
s
plight
said
you
will
sleep
well
why
yes
one
felt
like
sleeping
for
a
week
ah
well
was
the
quiet
comment
mr
andrews
would
do
all
that
and
more
three
times
maybe
every
all
in
the
day
s
work
you
see
and
when
it
was
done
then
home
in
a
tramcar
to
have
his
dinner
a
talk
with
his
mother
over
the
telephone
and
so
to
work
again
until
eleven
in
andrews
became
a
member
of
the
institution
of
naval
architects
and
in
the
year
following
a
member
of
the
institution
of
mechanical
engineers
he
was
also
a
member
of
the
society
of
naval
architects
and
marine
engineers
new
york
and
an
honorary
member
of
the
belfast
association
of
engineers
in
he
made
a
home
for
himself
at
dunallan
windsor
avenue
belfast
marrying
on
june
helen
reilly
younger
daughter
of
the
late
john
doherty
barbour
of
conway
dunmurry
county
antrim
and
most
loyal
of
helpmates
concerning
his
married
life
so
woefully
restricted
in
point
of
years
as
it
was
rich
in
bounty
of
happiness
it
is
perhaps
sufficient
to
say
here
that
just
before
he
sailed
from
southampton
in
april
last
on
that
final
tragic
voyage
he
made
occasion
one
evening
whilst
talking
with
a
friend
to
contrast
his
own
lot
with
the
lot
of
some
husbands
he
knew
saying
amongst
other
things
that
in
the
whole
time
since
his
marriage
no
matter
how
often
he
had
been
away
or
how
late
he
had
stayed
at
the
yard
never
had
andrews
made
a
complaint
she
would
not
with
jane
eyre
she
could
say
i
am
my
husband
s
life
as
fully
as
he
is
in
a
child
was
born
to
them
and
named
elizabeth
law
barbour
iv
all
this
is
important
vital
a
great
deal
of
it
but
after
all
what
concerns
us
chiefly
in
this
brief
record
is
the
kind
of
man
thomas
andrews
and
the
fine
end
he
made
everything
one
supposes
in
this
workaday
world
must
eventually
be
expressed
in
terms
of
character
though
a
man
build
the
atlantic
fleet
himself
with
superhuman
vigour
of
hand
and
brain
and
have
not
character
what
profiteth
it
him
and
how
much
the
less
profiteth
it
the
fleets
maybe
at
last
perhaps
of
all
the
manual
professions
that
of
shipbuilding
is
the
one
demanding
from
those
engaged
in
it
masters
and
men
the
sternest
rectitude
good
enough
in
the
shipyard
is
never
enough
think
what
scamped
work
a
flawed
shaft
a
badly
laid
plate
an
error
in
calculation
may
mean
some
wild
night
out
in
the
atlantic
and
when
next
you
are
in
belfast
go
to
queen
s
island
and
see
there
in
the
shops
on
the
slips
how
everyone
is
striving
or
being
made
to
strive
on
your
behalf
and
that
of
all
who
voyage
for
the
absolute
to
a
hair
s
breadth
all
as
strong
and
sound
as
hands
can
achieve
each
rivet
of
all
the
millions
in
a
liner
perhaps
the
most
impressive
thing
one
saw
tested
separately
and
certified
with
its
own
chalk
mark
well
andrews
to
the
extent
of
his
powers
and
position
was
responsible
for
that
absolute
best
and
the
fact
that
he
was
proves
his
does
not
of
itself
establish
his
claim
to
a
place
high
and
apart
many
others
assuredly
have
succeeded
as
speedily
and
notably
as
he
taking
success
at
its
material
valuation
and
their
names
are
written
or
one
day
will
be
written
in
the
sand
but
irrespective
of
the
great
work
he
did
and
the
great
success
he
achieved
andrews
was
a
man
in
the
opinion
of
all
who
knew
him
whose
name
deserves
to
be
graven
in
enduring
characters
and
why
that
is
so
has
yet
to
some
extent
at
least
to
be
shown
in
appearance
he
made
a
fine
figure
standing
nearly
six
feet
high
weighing
some
two
hundred
pounds
straight
with
broad
shoulders
and
great
physical
development
he
had
dark
brown
hair
sharp
features
you
would
call
him
handsome
his
brown
eyes
met
yours
with
a
look
of
the
frankest
kindliness
and
when
he
gripped
your
hand
he
took
you
as
it
were
to
himself
even
as
you
see
him
in
a
portrait
you
feel
constrained
to
exclaim
as
many
did
at
first
sight
of
him
well
a
man
he
had
a
wonderful
ringing
laugh
an
easy
way
with
him
an
irishman
s
appreciation
of
humour
he
was
sunny
full
of
gaiety
he
loved
to
hear
a
good
story
and
could
tell
you
one
as
well
as
another
he
had
the
luck
to
be
simple
in
his
habits
and
pleasures
his
food
his
dress
his
tastes
give
him
health
plenty
of
friends
plenty
of
work
and
occasionally
some
spare
hours
in
which
to
enjoy
a
good
book
maeterlinck
s
of
the
for
preference
and
some
good
music
to
go
yachting
on
strangford
lough
or
picnicking
at
the
family
bungalow
on
braddock
island
or
for
a
long
jolly
ride
with
andrews
in
their
little
renault
round
the
ards
peninsula
and
he
was
thoroughly
content
when
of
a
saturday
evening
he
opened
the
door
so
the
servants
at
ardara
used
to
say
they
like
all
the
rest
waiting
expectantly
for
his
coming
it
was
as
though
a
wind
from
the
sea
swept
into
the
house
all
was
astir
his
presence
filled
the
place
soon
you
would
hear
his
father
s
greeting
well
my
big
son
how
are
you
and
thereafter
for
one
more
week
s
end
it
was
in
ardara
as
though
the
schoolboy
was
home
for
a
holiday
you
would
hear
tom
s
voice
and
laugh
through
the
house
and
his
step
on
the
stairs
you
would
see
him
gloved
and
veiled
out
working
among
his
bees
scampering
on
the
lawn
with
the
children
or
playing
with
the
dog
or
telling
many
a
good
story
to
the
family
circle
everyone
loved
a
distinguished
writer
erskine
childers
in
an
estimate
of
andrews
judges
that
the
charm
of
the
man
lay
in
a
combination
of
power
and
simplicity
others
tell
how
unassertive
he
was
and
modest
in
the
finest
sense
one
of
nature
s
gentlemen
says
a
foreman
who
owed
him
much
no
pride
at
all
ready
always
to
take
a
suggestion
from
anyone
always
expressing
his
views
quietly
and
considerately
having
of
himself
writes
andrews
the
humblest
opinion
of
anyone
i
ever
and
then
she
quotes
some
lines
he
liked
and
wrote
in
her
album
what
you
can
being
what
you
are
shine
like
a
if
you
can
not
as
a
star
work
like
a
pulley
if
you
can
not
as
a
crane
be
a
if
you
can
not
drive
a
and
goes
on
to
say
how
much
judge
payne
s
familiar
lines
express
the
spirit
and
motive
of
his
actions
throughout
life
and
how
always
he
had
such
a
love
for
humanity
that
everyone
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
felt
the
tremendous
influence
of
his
unselfish
nature
he
was
never
so
happy
as
when
giving
and
helping
many
a
faltering
youth
on
the
threshold
of
the
world
he
took
by
the
arm
and
led
forward
a
shipwright
testifies
to
his
frequent
acknowledgment
of
what
others
not
so
high
as
himself
tried
to
another
calls
him
a
kind
and
considerate
chief
and
a
good
friend
a
third
in
a
letter
full
of
heartbreak
at
his
loss
pays
him
fine
tribute
in
the
twenty
years
i
have
known
him
i
never
saw
in
him
a
single
crooked
turn
he
was
always
the
same
one
of
the
most
men
i
ever
worked
such
spontaneous
testimony
to
character
is
perhaps
sufficient
but
one
may
crown
it
by
repeating
a
story
told
with
full
appreciation
of
its
value
by
his
mother
when
king
edward
and
queen
alexandra
made
their
memorable
visit
to
belfast
in
july
the
line
of
route
passed
through
the
street
in
which
andrews
lived
and
to
witness
the
procession
he
invited
to
his
rooms
all
decorated
for
the
occasion
and
plentifully
supplied
with
dainties
a
large
party
of
children
well
my
dear
one
was
asked
afterwards
and
what
did
you
think
of
the
king
the
king
answered
the
oh
cousin
tommy
was
regarding
his
remarkable
powers
of
application
and
industry
enough
too
has
perhaps
already
been
written
but
what
must
be
made
clear
even
at
the
cost
of
repetition
for
therein
lay
the
man
s
strength
was
the
spirit
in
which
he
approached
the
great
business
of
work
it
has
been
said
and
doubtless
will
be
said
again
that
for
one
to
labour
as
andrews
did
whatever
the
incentive
or
object
is
an
inhuman
process
making
for
narrowness
of
manhood
and
a
condition
of
drudgery
perhaps
so
herbert
spencer
once
expressed
some
such
opinion
it
is
largely
a
question
of
one
s
point
of
view
to
a
lesser
extent
perhaps
a
matter
of
aptitude
or
circumstance
at
all
events
in
this
respect
it
seems
wise
to
distinguish
as
between
man
and
man
and
work
and
work
for
with
the
example
of
andrews
before
them
even
cavillers
must
admit
that
what
they
call
drudgery
can
be
well
justified
how
he
would
have
laughed
had
someone
even
a
herbert
spencer
called
him
a
drudge
anyone
less
the
creature
however
you
regarded
him
you
could
not
easily
find
work
was
his
nature
his
life
he
throve
upon
it
lived
for
it
loved
it
and
think
what
a
work
it
was
the
noblest
one
repeats
done
by
men
in
his
dressingroom
was
hung
a
framed
copy
of
henry
van
dyke
s
sonnet
it
is
worth
quoting
me
but
do
my
work
from
day
to
day
in
field
or
forest
at
the
desk
or
loom
in
roaring
or
tranquil
room
let
me
but
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
when
vagrant
wishes
beckon
me
astray
this
is
my
work
my
blessing
not
my
doom
of
all
who
live
i
am
the
one
by
whom
this
work
can
best
be
done
in
my
own
way
then
shall
i
see
it
not
too
great
nor
small
to
suit
my
spirit
and
to
prove
my
powers
then
shall
i
cheerfully
greet
the
labouring
hours
and
cheerful
turn
when
the
long
shadows
fall
at
eventide
to
play
and
love
and
rest
because
i
know
for
me
my
work
is
this
is
my
work
my
blessing
not
my
doom
because
i
know
for
me
my
work
is
best
can
it
be
said
that
the
man
who
worked
in
the
spirit
of
those
words
having
them
before
him
like
a
prayer
each
morning
and
each
night
was
not
fulfilling
destiny
in
a
noble
way
no
mean
thought
of
self
no
small
striving
after
worldly
success
but
always
the
endeavour
to
work
in
his
own
way
to
suit
his
spirit
and
to
prove
his
powers
if
that
way
be
so
is
the
way
narrow
that
leads
to
eternal
life
but
it
might
be
said
andrews
had
such
opportunity
and
the
rare
good
fortune
also
to
have
his
spirit
suited
with
work
that
proved
his
powers
it
was
so
yet
one
knows
certainly
that
had
his
opportunity
been
different
he
would
still
have
seized
it
have
been
the
best
engine
driver
in
ulster
or
have
greased
wheels
contentedly
and
with
all
diligence
one
remembers
the
sentence
from
ruskin
which
he
had
printed
on
his
christmas
card
for
what
we
think
or
what
we
know
or
what
we
believe
is
in
the
end
of
little
consequence
the
only
thing
of
consequence
is
what
we
the
best
doing
always
and
every
way
one
knows
how
that
aspiration
would
appeal
to
andrews
good
unitarian
that
he
was
just
as
one
knows
how
ruskin
he
who
made
roads
and
had
such
burning
sympathy
always
with
honest
workers
would
have
appreciated
andrews
and
agreed
that
the
name
of
such
a
man
should
not
perish
as
have
the
names
of
most
other
of
the
world
s
great
architects
and
builders
i
commence
my
year
at
the
works
all
interesting
and
happy
days
i
would
go
right
back
over
them
again
if
i
could
one
feels
that
the
spirit
of
those
words
written
by
andrews
to
his
wife
on
may
would
have
appealed
to
ruskin
and
had
he
known
the
man
would
he
not
have
noted
as
did
another
adams
of
how
it
was
to
the
human
question
the
man
s
mind
always
turned
and
been
eager
to
judge
that
here
was
one
who
had
in
him
the
true
stuff
of
the
best
kind
of
captain
of
industry
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
circumstances
which
brought
these
two
men
together
adams
who
is
now
professor
of
political
theory
and
institutions
at
oxford
was
then
superintendent
of
statistics
and
intelligence
in
the
irish
department
of
agriculture
and
technical
instruction
he
went
to
andrews
as
the
man
most
likely
to
give
him
reliable
information
and
sound
opinions
upon
certain
industrial
questions
of
interest
to
the
department
a
peculiar
value
attaches
to
the
high
regard
in
which
thomas
andrews
was
held
by
this
distinguished
political
and
economic
thinker
a
captain
of
industry
the
phrase
is
happy
and
convincing
too
is
the
passage
wherein
erskine
childers
gives
his
impression
of
andrews
as
towards
the
close
of
he
saw
him
one
day
working
in
the
island
yard
it
was
bracing
to
be
near
him
writes
childers
and
then
goes
on
his
mind
seemed
to
revel
in
its
mastery
both
of
the
details
and
of
the
both
of
the
technical
and
the
human
side
of
a
great
science
while
restlessly
seeking
to
enlarge
its
outlook
conquer
new
problems
and
achieve
an
ever
fresh
perfection
whether
it
was
about
the
pitch
of
a
propeller
or
the
higher
problems
of
design
speed
and
mercantile
competition
one
felt
the
same
grip
and
enthusiasm
and
above
all
perhaps
the
same
delight
in
frank
we
come
back
then
to
andrews
as
childers
saw
him
on
that
day
in
the
strong
inspiriting
full
of
enthusiasm
and
genuine
captain
of
industry
there
on
the
scene
of
his
triumphs
yet
revealing
himself
as
modestly
we
know
as
any
of
the
great
army
of
workers
under
his
direction
before
attempting
to
give
some
further
and
completer
account
of
the
relations
which
existed
between
him
and
the
islanders
it
may
be
well
to
give
a
letter
written
by
andrews
in
to
a
young
relative
then
beginning
work
as
an
engineer
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
get
a
shake
of
your
fist
old
chap
before
leaving
just
to
wish
you
good
luck
at
your
business
and
a
good
time
at
please
accept
from
me
the
enclosed
small
gift
to
go
towards
a
little
you
are
such
a
sensible
boy
i
know
that
you
require
no
advice
from
me
but
as
an
old
hand
who
has
come
through
the
mill
myself
i
would
just
like
to
say
how
important
it
is
for
you
to
endeavour
to
give
your
employers
full
confidence
in
you
from
the
start
this
can
best
be
gained
by
punctuality
and
close
attention
to
your
work
at
all
don
t
allow
your
health
to
suffer
through
overwork
always
carry
out
instructions
given
by
those
above
you
whether
you
agree
with
them
or
try
to
get
instructions
in
writing
if
you
are
not
sure
of
your
man
always
treat
those
above
you
with
respect
no
matter
whether
they
are
fools
or
know
less
than
yourself
never
give
information
unless
you
are
perfectly
sure
better
to
say
you
are
not
sure
but
will
look
the
matter
up
never
be
anxious
to
show
how
quick
you
are
by
being
the
first
out
of
the
shop
when
the
horn
blows
it
is
better
on
these
occasions
to
be
a
bit
slow
now
this
is
a
sermon
by
thomas
but
not
one
of
your
father
that
of
an
old
cousin
who
has
high
expectations
of
you
and
is
interested
in
your
welfare
goodbye
and
good
that
little
sermon
by
thomas
with
its
admixture
of
shrewdness
wisdom
and
may
be
taken
as
embodying
the
workaday
rules
of
duty
perfected
by
andrews
through
a
varied
experience
of
sixteen
doubtless
as
faithfully
observed
by
himself
as
they
were
commended
for
the
guidance
of
others
what
may
be
called
its
horse
sense
its
blunt
avowal
of
how
to
play
the
game
helps
us
towards
a
fuller
understanding
of
the
man
puts
him
in
the
plain
light
through
which
every
day
in
view
of
everyone
he
passed
it
shows
us
why
he
succeeded
why
in
any
circumstances
and
irrespective
almost
of
his
higher
qualities
he
was
bound
to
succeed
it
explains
to
some
extent
what
a
workman
meant
in
calling
him
a
born
leader
of
it
helps
us
to
understand
why
some
called
him
a
hard
man
and
why
he
made
a
few
enemies
helps
us
also
to
understand
why
the
islander
who
threatened
to
drop
a
bag
of
rivets
on
his
head
was
treated
with
laughing
amenity
what
andrews
demanded
of
others
he
exacted
in
greater
measure
of
himself
if
at
times
he
enforced
his
code
of
conduct
with
sternness
in
that
as
all
who
felt
the
weight
of
his
hand
would
eventually
acknowledge
he
was
but
doing
his
plain
duty
did
men
skulk
or
scamp
their
job
they
must
be
shown
decisively
that
a
shipyard
was
no
place
for
them
someone
discovered
asleep
on
a
nine
inch
plank
spanning
an
open
ventilator
must
be
taught
discretion
but
no
bullying
no
all
no
show
of
malice
if
in
andrews
nature
was
no
trace
of
maliciousness
neither
did
there
lurk
in
it
any
meanness
not
once
but
a
thousand
times
during
the
past
black
months
has
his
character
been
summed
with
characteristic
terseness
by
the
island
shipwrights
just
as
a
judge
straight
as
a
die
there
wasn
t
a
crooked
turn
in
him
simple
phrases
conveying
a
magnificent
tribute
for
what
better
in
anyone
can
you
have
than
the
straightness
of
a
die
whether
you
regard
him
as
man
or
master
and
such
straightness
in
a
shipbuilder
is
not
that
the
supreme
quality
at
all
events
this
quality
of
absolute
rectitude
so
indispensable
in
other
respects
was
the
main
quality
which
in
their
personal
relations
with
him
won
for
andrews
the
admiration
and
esteem
of
the
islanders
they
could
trust
him
he
would
see
fair
play
if
he
caught
you
doing
wrong
he
wasn
t
afraid
to
tell
you
if
he
found
you
breaking
a
rule
he
wouldn
t
fire
you
straight
away
but
would
give
you
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue
and
a
friendly
so
long
as
one
reported
a
mistake
honestly
he
had
consideration
but
try
to
hide
it
away
and
he
blazed
at
he
had
a
grand
eye
for
good
work
and
a
good
man
and
the
man
who
did
good
work
no
matter
who
he
was
got
a
clap
on
the
so
the
islanders
this
man
and
that
and
then
once
more
comes
the
crowning
judgment
on
the
tongue
of
so
many
he
was
straight
as
a
but
not
that
one
quality
alone
gained
for
andrews
his
great
one
might
say
his
unique
popularity
in
the
yard
his
vast
knowledge
his
mastery
of
detail
his
assiduity
his
zest
all
these
merits
had
their
due
effect
upon
the
men
and
effective
too
was
the
desire
he
showed
always
to
get
the
best
possible
out
of
every
worker
it
was
not
enough
to
your
job
he
expected
you
to
about
it
and
if
from
your
thinking
resulted
a
suggestion
it
got
his
best
consideration
it
might
be
mind
better
luck
next
time
if
it
were
worth
a
cent
he
would
make
it
shine
in
your
eyes
like
a
dollar
in
addition
were
those
more
personal
so
to
speak
of
the
man
s
character
his
generosity
kindliness
patience
geniality
humour
humility
courage
that
great
laugh
of
his
the
winning
smile
the
fine
breezy
presence
of
those
also
the
men
had
constant
and
intimate
experience
anyone
in
trouble
might
be
sure
of
his
sympathy
after
a
spell
of
sickness
his
handshake
and
hearty
greeting
stirred
new
life
in
your
blood
once
he
found
a
great
fellow
a
small
foreman
who
for
sufficient
reason
had
docked
his
wages
whereupon
andrews
took
off
his
coat
and
hammered
the
bully
during
labour
and
party
troubles
he
several
times
at
risk
of
his
life
saved
men
from
the
mob
one
day
in
a
gale
he
climbed
an
eighty
foot
staging
rescued
the
terrified
man
who
had
gone
up
to
secure
the
loose
boards
and
himself
did
the
work
another
day
he
lent
a
hand
to
a
shipwright
toiling
across
the
yard
under
a
heavy
beam
and
as
they
went
andrews
asked
how
is
it
m
ilwaine
you
always
like
to
be
beside
me
ah
sir
was
the
reply
it
is
because
you
carry
up
these
incidents
chosen
from
so
many
enable
us
to
see
why
in
the
words
of
the
island
poet
though
andrews
was
our
master
we
loved
him
to
a
he
always
carried
up
well
stood
to
all
the
winds
that
too
often
those
in
authority
rule
as
tyrants
using
power
like
some
juggernaut
crushing
under
the
beasts
of
burden
but
andrews
following
the
example
of
his
uncle
preferred
to
rule
beneficently
as
a
man
among
his
fellows
one
evening
writes
andrews
my
husband
and
i
were
in
the
vicinity
of
queen
s
island
and
noticing
a
long
file
of
men
going
home
from
work
he
turned
to
me
and
said
there
go
my
pals
i
can
never
forget
the
tone
in
his
voice
as
he
said
that
it
was
as
though
the
men
were
as
dear
to
him
as
his
own
brothers
afterwards
on
a
similar
occasion
i
reminded
him
of
the
words
and
he
said
yes
and
they
are
real
pals
you
see
now
why
a
colleague
saxon
payne
secretary
to
lord
pirrie
could
write
it
was
not
a
case
of
liking
him
we
all
loved
him
and
why
during
those
awful
days
in
april
when
hope
of
good
news
at
last
had
gone
the
yard
was
shrouded
in
gloom
and
rough
men
cried
like
women
they
had
lost
a
pal
and
not
they
only
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
wherever
men
resort
whose
business
is
in
the
great
waters
owners
commanders
directors
managers
architects
engineers
ships
officers
stewards
sailors
the
name
tom
andrews
is
honoured
as
that
of
one
whose
remarkable
combination
of
gifts
claimed
not
only
their
admiration
but
their
affection
what
we
are
to
do
without
andrews
said
a
belfast
i
don
t
know
he
was
probably
the
best
man
in
the
world
for
his
ready
for
manage
what
a
friend
it
s
irreparable
surely
of
all
men
worth
saving
he
ought
to
have
been
saved
yes
saved
by
force
for
only
in
that
way
could
it
have
been
here
too
it
may
be
mentioned
that
during
his
business
career
andrews
received
many
acknowledgements
of
a
gratifying
description
from
those
whom
in
various
ways
he
had
others
from
the
white
star
company
the
hamburg
american
company
and
what
i
daresay
he
valued
as
much
from
the
stewards
of
the
following
the
announcement
of
his
marriage
a
committee
was
organised
at
the
yard
for
the
purpose
of
showing
him
in
a
tangible
way
the
esteem
of
the
islanders
but
for
business
reasons
or
perhaps
feeling
a
delicacy
in
accepting
a
compliment
without
parallel
in
the
history
of
the
yard
he
whilst
making
it
plain
how
much
the
kindly
thought
had
moved
him
felt
constrained
to
ask
the
committee
to
desist
one
may
end
this
imperfect
chapter
with
two
more
tributes
themselves
without
any
great
literary
merit
perhaps
yet
testifying
sincerely
one
thinks
to
the
love
which
andrews
inspired
in
everyone
illustration
the
titanic
and
the
olympic
building
in
the
largest
gantry
in
the
world
long
ago
poor
doctor
o
loughlin
wrote
in
collaboration
with
the
purser
of
the
some
verses
to
be
sung
to
the
air
doubtless
they
have
been
sung
at
ship
s
mess
on
many
a
voyage
and
perhaps
have
elsewhere
been
printed
one
verse
is
given
here
a
gantry
high
and
mighty
she
had
birth
and
she
d
bulk
and
length
and
height
and
mighty
beam
and
the
world
was
only
larger
in
its
girth
and
she
seemed
to
be
a
living
moving
dream
then
she
rode
so
grandly
o
er
the
sea
that
she
seemed
a
beauty
decked
in
bright
array
and
the
whistle
sounded
loudly
as
she
sailed
along
so
proudly
that
we
all
cried
out
she
must
be
quite
oh
tommy
tommy
andrews
we
are
all
so
proud
of
you
and
to
say
we
have
the
finest
ship
that
e
er
was
built
is
true
may
your
hand
ne
er
lose
its
cunning
we
don
t
care
how
winds
may
roar
for
we
know
we
have
a
frigate
that
can
sail
from
shore
to
the
second
tribute
is
taken
from
a
written
by
the
island
poet
in
the
ballad
form
so
popular
in
ireland
and
circulated
widely
in
the
yard
queen
s
island
trojan
he
worked
to
the
last
very
proud
we
all
feel
of
him
here
in
belfast
our
knew
him
as
one
of
the
he
stuck
to
his
duty
and
god
gave
him
vi
it
remains
before
giving
account
of
the
finest
action
of
his
life
to
consider
briefly
by
way
of
rounding
his
portrait
what
we
may
call
andrews
outside
side
that
is
he
might
turn
to
some
committee
of
experts
sitting
in
solemn
judgment
upon
him
as
a
possible
candidate
for
political
honours
that
side
it
may
be
said
at
once
is
singularly
unpretentious
and
indeed
when
we
think
of
his
absorption
heart
and
soul
in
what
he
knew
for
him
was
best
who
could
expect
or
wish
it
to
be
otherwise
in
ulster
heaven
knows
are
publicists
galore
and
sufficient
men
too
willing
to
down
tools
at
any
outside
that
we
should
the
less
admire
one
who
spoke
only
once
in
public
took
no
open
part
in
politics
and
was
not
even
a
strong
he
was
however
a
member
of
the
ulster
reform
club
twice
he
was
pressed
to
accept
the
presidency
of
unionist
clubs
frequently
he
was
urged
to
permit
his
nomination
for
election
to
the
city
council
the
belfast
harbour
board
shared
the
opinion
of
one
of
its
leading
members
that
his
youthful
vigour
his
undoubted
ability
and
his
genial
personality
would
have
made
him
an
acquisition
to
this
important
his
in
a
resolution
of
condolence
expressed
their
feeling
that
not
only
had
the
firm
lost
a
valued
and
promising
leader
but
the
city
an
upright
and
capable
citizen
who
had
he
lived
would
have
taken
a
still
more
conspicuous
place
in
the
industrial
and
commercial
even
in
the
south
where
admiration
of
northerners
is
not
commonly
fervent
it
was
admitted
by
many
that
in
andrews
ulster
had
at
last
found
the
makings
of
a
leader
from
such
straws
blown
in
so
prevailing
a
wind
we
may
determine
the
estimation
in
which
andrews
as
a
prospective
citizen
stood
amongst
those
who
knew
him
and
their
own
needs
the
best
and
also
perhaps
may
roughly
calculate
the
possibilities
of
that
future
which
he
himself
in
stray
minutes
of
leisure
may
have
anticipated
but
some
there
will
be
doubtless
whose
admiration
of
andrews
is
the
finer
because
he
kept
the
path
of
his
career
straight
to
its
course
without
any
deviation
to
enticing
havens
such
a
man
however
the
son
of
such
a
father
could
not
fail
to
have
views
on
the
burning
topics
of
his
time
and
no
estimate
of
him
would
be
complete
which
gave
these
no
heed
he
was
we
are
told
an
imperialist
loving
peace
and
consequently
in
favour
of
an
unchallengeable
navy
he
was
a
firm
unionist
being
convinced
that
home
rule
would
spell
financial
ruin
to
ireland
through
the
partial
loss
of
british
credit
and
of
the
security
derived
from
connection
with
a
strong
and
prosperous
partner
at
times
he
was
known
to
express
disapproval
of
the
policy
adopted
by
those
irish
unionists
who
strove
to
influence
british
electors
by
appeals
to
passion
rather
than
by
means
of
reasoned
argument
also
he
felt
that
ireland
would
never
be
happy
and
prosperous
until
agitation
ceased
and
promise
of
security
were
offered
to
the
investing
capitalist
though
no
believer
in
modern
cities
he
was
of
opinion
that
an
effort
should
be
made
to
expand
and
stimulate
irish
village
life
it
seeming
to
him
that
a
country
dependent
solely
on
agriculture
was
like
a
man
fighting
the
battle
of
life
with
one
hand
were
however
an
approved
system
of
agriculture
such
as
that
advocated
by
sir
horace
plunkett
joined
with
a
considered
scheme
of
town
and
village
industries
he
believed
that
emigration
would
cease
and
ireland
find
prosperity
to
the
practical
application
of
tariff
reform
he
saw
many
difficulties
but
thought
them
not
insuperable
in
view
of
the
needs
of
a
and
growing
empire
the
necessity
of
preserving
british
work
for
british
people
and
the
injury
done
to
home
trade
by
the
unfair
competition
of
protected
countries
he
judged
that
the
duties
upon
imported
necessities
should
be
materially
reduced
and
a
counterbalancing
tax
levied
on
all
articles
of
foreign
manufacture
he
advocated
moderate
social
reform
on
lines
carefully
designed
to
encourage
thrift
temperance
and
endeavour
and
as
one
prime
means
towards
improving
the
condition
both
moral
and
physical
of
the
workers
he
would
have
the
state
either
directly
or
through
local
authorities
provide
them
with
decent
homes
to
the
consideration
of
labour
problems
particularly
those
coming
within
the
scope
of
his
own
experience
he
gave
much
thought
and
when
it
is
considered
that
his
great
popularity
with
all
classes
held
steady
through
the
recent
period
of
industrial
unrest
we
may
judge
that
his
attitude
towards
labour
in
the
mass
as
in
the
unit
was
no
mere
personal
expression
of
friendliness
as
his
real
pals
he
wanted
to
help
the
workers
educate
and
lift
them
other
things
being
equal
he
always
favoured
the
men
who
used
their
heads
as
well
as
their
hands
and
if
in
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
they
used
their
heads
then
also
so
much
the
better
for
all
concerned
he
considered
that
both
in
the
interests
of
men
and
masters
it
was
well
for
labour
to
be
organized
under
capable
leaders
but
honest
agreements
should
he
thought
be
binding
on
both
sides
and
not
liable
to
governmental
interference
politicians
and
others
should
in
their
public
utterances
he
felt
endeavour
to
educate
the
workers
in
the
principles
of
economics
relative
to
trade
wages
and
the
relations
between
capital
and
labour
but
publicists
who
for
party
or
like
reasons
strove
to
foster
class
hatreds
and
strifes
he
would
hang
by
the
heels
from
a
gantry
where
economically
possible
the
working
day
should
he
thought
be
shortened
especially
the
day
of
all
toiling
in
arduous
and
unwholesome
conditions
similarly
he
was
disposed
to
favour
when
economically
possible
encouragement
of
the
workers
by
means
of
a
system
of
profit
sharing
he
would
furthermore
give
them
every
facility
for
technical
education
but
such
he
knew
from
experience
was
of
little
value
unless
supplemented
by
thorough
practical
knowledge
gained
in
the
workshop
these
views
and
opinions
whatever
their
intrinsic
value
in
the
eyes
of
experts
are
at
least
interesting
sooner
or
later
had
andrews
lived
he
would
perhaps
have
made
them
the
basis
of
public
pronouncements
and
then
indeed
might
his
abounding
energy
applied
in
new
and
luring
directions
have
carried
him
to
heights
of
citizenship
vii
happily
there
is
no
need
in
these
pages
to
attempt
any
minute
estimate
of
the
share
andrews
had
in
building
the
such
a
task
were
it
feasible
would
offer
difficulties
no
less
testing
than
those
met
courageously
by
half
the
world
s
journalists
when
attempting
to
describe
the
wonders
of
that
length
that
of
a
suburban
street
her
height
the
equivalent
of
a
seventeen
story
building
her
elevator
cars
coursing
up
and
down
as
through
a
city
hotel
her
millionaire
suites
her
luxuries
of
squash
racquet
courts
turkish
and
electric
bath
establishments
salt
water
swimming
pools
glass
enclosed
sun
parlours
verandah
cafés
and
all
probably
no
one
man
was
solely
responsible
for
the
beautiful
thing
she
was
an
evolution
rather
than
a
creation
triumphant
product
of
numberless
experiments
a
perfection
embodying
who
knows
what
endeavour
from
this
a
little
from
that
a
little
more
of
human
brain
and
hand
and
imagination
how
many
ships
were
built
how
many
lost
how
many
men
lived
wrought
and
died
that
the
might
be
so
much
being
said
it
may
however
be
said
further
that
to
her
building
andrews
gave
as
much
of
himself
as
did
any
other
man
all
his
experience
of
ships
gained
in
the
yards
on
voyages
by
long
study
was
in
her
all
his
deep
knowledge
too
gathered
during
twenty
years
and
now
applied
in
a
crowning
effort
with
an
ardour
that
never
flagged
it
was
by
the
her
vast
shape
slowly
assuming
the
beauty
and
symmetry
which
are
but
a
memory
that
childers
met
andrews
and
noted
in
him
those
qualities
of
zest
vigour
power
and
simplicity
which
impressed
him
deeply
yet
andrews
then
was
no
whit
more
enthusiastic
we
feel
sure
than
on
any
other
day
of
the
great
ship
s
fashioning
from
the
time
of
her
conception
slowly
down
through
the
long
process
of
calculating
planning
designing
building
fitting
until
at
last
she
sailed
proudly
away
to
the
applause
of
half
the
world
whatever
share
others
had
in
her
his
at
least
can
not
be
gainsaid
as
lord
pirrie
s
assistant
he
had
done
his
part
by
way
of
shaping
into
tangible
form
the
projects
of
her
owners
as
chief
designer
and
naval
architect
he
planned
her
complete
as
managing
director
he
saw
her
grow
up
frame
by
frame
plate
by
plate
day
after
day
throughout
more
than
two
years
watched
her
grow
as
a
father
watches
his
child
grow
assiduously
minutely
and
with
much
the
same
feelings
of
parental
pride
and
affection
for
andrews
this
was
ship
whatever
his
hand
in
her
and
in
that
she
was
efficiently
designed
and
constructed
as
is
now
established
his
fame
as
a
shipbuilder
may
well
rest
as
surely
none
other
did
he
knew
her
inside
and
out
her
every
turn
and
art
the
power
and
beauty
of
her
from
keel
to
her
to
the
last
rivet
and
because
he
knew
the
great
ship
so
well
as
a
father
knows
the
child
born
to
him
therefore
to
lose
her
was
heartbreak

taking

we

away
this

in
fine

have

every

there
is
still
a

to
be

still
on

when
the

arrived
at

andrews
was
ceaselessly
employed
going
round
with
representatives
of
the
owners
and
of
the
firm
in
taking
notes
and
preparing
reports
of
work
still
to
be
done
all
the
next
day
from
an
early
hour
he
spent
with
managers
and
foremen
putting
work
in
hand
in
the
evening
he
wrote
to
andrews
i
wired
you
this
morning
of
our
safe
arrival
after
a
very
satisfactory
trip
the
weather
was
good
and
everyone
most
pleasant
i
think
the
ship
will
clean
up
all
right
before
sailing
on
wednesday
and
then
he
mentions
that
the
doctors
refused
to
allow
lord
pirrie
to
make
the
maiden
voyage
thereafter
from
day
to
day
until
the
date
of
sailing
he
was
always
busy
taking
the
owners
round
ship
interviewing
engineers
officials
agents
managers
discussing
with
principals
the
plans
of
new
ships
and
superintending
generally
the
work
of
completion
through
the
various
days
that
the
vessel
lay
at
southampton
writes
his
secretary
thompson
hamilton
mr
andrews
was
never
for
a
moment
idle
he
generally
left
his
hotel
about
for
the
offices
where
he
dealt
with
his
correspondence
then
went
on
board
until
when
he
would
return
to
the
offices
to
sign
letters
during
the
day
i
took
to
the
ship
any
urgent
papers
and
he
always
dealt
with
them
no
matter
what
his
nothing
he
allowed
to
interfere
with
duty
he
was
conscientious
to
the
minutest
detail
he
would
himself
put
in
their
place
such
things
as
racks
tables
chairs
berth
ladders
electric
fans
saving
that
except
he
saw
everything
right
he
could
not

expresses
agreement
with
the
owner
that
the
colouring
of
the
pebble
dashing
on
the
private
promenade
decks
was
too
dark
and
notes
a
plan
for
staining
green
the
wicker
furniture
on

side
of

withal
his
thought
for
others
never
failed
now
he
is
arranging
for
a
party
to
view
the
ship
now
writing
to
a
colleague
i
have
always
in
mind
a
week
s
holiday
due
to
you
from
last
summer
and
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
make
arrangements
to
take
these
on
my
return
as
although
you
may
not
desire
to
have
them
i
feel
sure
that
a
week
s
rest
will
do
you
on
the
evening
of
sunday
the
he
wrote
to
andrews
giving
her
news
of
his
movements
and
dwelling
upon
the
plans
he
had
in
mind
for
the
future
on
the
he
wrote
the
is
now
about
complete
and
will
i
think
do
the
old
firm
credit
when
we
on
the
he
was
aboard
at
o
clock
and
thence
until
the
hour
of
sailing
he
spent
in
a
long
final
inspection
of
the
ship
she
pleased
him
the
old
firm
was
sure
of
its
credit
just
before
the
moorings
were
cast
off
he
bade
goodbye
to
hamilton
and
the
other
officials
he
seemed
in
excellent
health
and
spirits
his
last
words
were
remember
now
and
keep
andrews
informed
of
any
news
of
the
the
carrying
souls
left
southampton
punctually
at
noon
on
april
there
was
no
departure
ceremony
on
her
way
from
dock
she
passed
the
and
the
both
giants
of
twenty
years
ago
and
now
by
contrast
with
leviathan
humbled
to
the
stature
of
dwarfs
about
a
mile
down
the
water
she
passed
test
quay
where
the
and
the
lay
berthed
her
wash
caused
the
to
break
her
moorings
and
drift
into
the
channel
as
the
was
going
dead
slow
danger
of
a
collision
was
soon
averted
but
as
andrews
wrote
that
evening
the
situation
was
decidedly
from
cherbourg
he
wrote
again
to
andrews
we
reached
here
in
nice
time
and
took
on
board
quite
a
number
of
passengers
the
two
little
tenders
looked
well
you
will
remember
we
built
them
about
a
year
ago
we
expect
to
arrive
at
queenstown
about
the
weather
is
fine
and
everything
shaping
for
a
good
voyage
i
have
a
seat
at
the
doctor
s
one
more
letter
was
received
from
him
by
andrews
and
only
one
this
time
from
queenstown
and
dated
april
everything
on
board
was
going
splendidly
he
said
and
he
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
receiving
so
much
kindness
from
everyone
here
all
direct
testimony
ceases
proudly
in
eye
of
the
world
the
sailed
westward
from
the
irish
coast
then
for
a
while
disappeared
only
to
reappear
in
a
brief
scene
of
woefullest
tragedy
round
which
the
world
stayed
mute
if
as
is
almost
certain
a
chronicle
of
the
voyage
was
made
by
andrews
both
it
and
the
family
letters
he
wrote
now
are
gone
with
him
but
fortunately
we
have
other
evidence
plentiful
and
and
on
such
our
story
henceforward
runs
the
steward
henry
etches
who
attended
him
says
that
during
the
voyage
right
to
the
moment
of
disaster
andrews
was
constantly
busy
with
his
workmen
he
went
about
the
boat
all
day
long
putting
things
right
and
making
note
of
every
suggestion
of
an
imperfection
afterwards
in
his
stateroom
which
is
described
as
being
full
of
charts
he
would
sit
for
hours
making
calculations
and
drawings
for
future
use
others
speak
of
his
great
popularity
with
both
passengers
and
crew
i
was
proud
of
him
writes
the
brave
stewardess
miss
may
sloan
of
belfast
whose
testimony
is
so
invaluable
he
came
from
home
and
he
made
you
feel
on
the
ship
that
all
was
and
then
she
adds
how
because
of
his
big
gentle
kindly
nature
everyone
loved
him
it
was
good
to
hear
his
laugh
and
have
him
near
you
if
anything
went
wrong
it
was
always
to
andrews
one
went
even
when
a
fan
stuck
in
a
stateroom
one
would
say
wait
for
andrews
he
ll
soon
see
to
it
and
you
would
find
him
settling
even
the
little
quarrels
that
arose
between
ourselves
nothing
came
amiss
to
him
nothing
at
all
and
he
was
always
the
same
a
nod
and
a
smile
or
a
hearty
word
whenever
he
saw
you
and
no
matter
what
he
was
two
of
his
table
companions
and
albert
dick
of
calgary
alberta
also
tell
how
much
they
came
to
love
andrews
because
of
his
character
and
how
good
it
was
to
see
his
pride
in
the
ship
but
upon
every
occasion
and
especially
at
dinner
on
sunday
evening
he
talked
almost
constantly
about
his
wife
little
girl
mother
and
family
as
well
as
of
his
this
with
home
and
all
there
was
noticed
too
by
miss
sloan
sometimes
between
laughs
he
would
suddenly
fall
grave
and
glance
you
might
say
back
over
a
shoulder
towards
dunallan
and
ardara
far
off
near
strangford
lough
i
was
talking
to
him
on
the
friday
night
as
he
was
going
into
dinner
writes
miss
sloan
in
a
letter
dated
from
the
on
april
the
dear
old
doctor
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
and
calling
him
by
his
christian
name
tommy
andrews
seemed
loth
to
go
he
wanted
to
talk
about
home
he
was
telling
me
his
father
was
ill
and
andrews
not
so
well
i
was
congratulating
him
on
the
beauty
and
perfection
of
the
ship
he
said
the
part
he
did
not
like
was
that
the
was
taking
us
further
away
from
home
every
hour
i
looked
at
him
and
his
face
struck
me
as
having
a
very
sad
o
loughlin
senior
surgeon
of
the
white
star
line
a
close
friend
of
andrews
and
his
companion
on
many
voyages
some
lines
which
he
helped
to
write
have
been
quoted
soon
after
the
ship
struck
he
said
to
miss
child
things
are
very
bad
and
went
to
his
death
bravely
his
assistant
simpson
son
of
an
eminent
belfast
physician
and
himself
a
physician
of
much
promise
died
with
him
one
other
glimpse
we
have
of
him
then
in
that
brief
time
of
triumph
whilst
yet
the
good
ship
of
his
which
everyone
praised
was
speeding
westwards
in
perfectly
clear
and
fine
weather
towards
the
place
where
was
no
moon
the
stars
were
out
and
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
for
more
than
a
week
he
had
been
working
at
such
pressure
that
by
the
friday
evening
many
saw
how
tired
as
well
as
sad
he
looked
but
by
the
sunday
evening
when
his
ship
was
as
perfect
so
he
said
as
brains
could
make
her
he
was
himself
again
i
saw
him
go
in
to
dinner
said
miss
sloan
he
was
in
good
spirits
and
i
thought
he
looked
report
of
mersey
commission
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
he
went
aft
to
thank
the
baker
for
some
special
bread
he
had
made
for
him
then
back
to
his
stateroom
where
apparently
he
changed
into
working
clothes
and
sat
down
to
write
he
was
still
writing
it
would
seem
when
the
captain
called
him
viii
on
the
night
of
sunday
april
at
ship
s
time
in
clear
fine
weather
near
latitude
longitude
the
collided
with
the
submerged
spur
of
an
iceberg
and
ripped
her
starboard
side
ten
feet
above
the
level
of
the
keel
for
a
length
of
about
three
hundred
feet
thereby
giving
access
to
the
sea
in
six
of
her
forward
compartments
the
calamity
came
with
dreadful
swiftness
in
the
vivid
words
of
a
stoker
on
duty
at
the
time
of
collision
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
the
stem
all
of
a
sudden
the
starboard
side
of
the
ship
came
in
upon
us
it
burst
like
a
big
gun
going
off
the
water
came
pouring
in
and
swilled
our
within
ten
minutes
the
water
rose
fourteen
feet
above
the
keel
in
five
of
the
compartments
afterwards
it
rose
steadily
in
all
six
and
by
midnight
had
submerged
the
lower
deck
in
the
foremost
hold
yet
so
gentle
apparently
was
the
shock
of
contact
that
among
the
passengers
and
probably
among
most
of
the
crew
as
well
it
was
only
the
stopping
of
the
engines
that
warned
them
of
some
happening
whilst
for
a
considerable
time
so
quietly
the
great
ship
lay
on
the
flat
sea
such
confidence
had
all
in
her
strength
and
so
orderly
was
everything
that
to
many
almost
to
the
last
it
seemed
impossible
that
disaster
had
come

letter
to
the
dated
may
at
first
we
did
not
realise
says
albert
dick
that
the
was
mortally
wounded
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
on
her
realised
she
was
going
to
dick
goes
on
to
record
that
in
his
view
nothing
deserved
more
praise
than
the
conduct
of
andrews
after
the
ship
had
struck
he
was
on
hand
at
once
and
said
that
he
was
going
below
to
investigate
we
begged
him
not
to
go
but
he
insisted
saying
he
knew
the
ship
as
no
one
else
did
and
that
he
might
be
able
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
passengers
he
went
york
april
as
the
minutes
flew
by
we
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
which
way
to
turn
captain
smith
was
everywhere
doing
his
best
to
calm
the
rising
tide
of
fear
but
in
the
minds
of
most
of
us
there
was
the
feeling
that
something
was
going
to
happen
and
we
waited
for
andrews
to
come
back
when
he
came
we
hung
upon
his
words
and
they
were
these
there
is
no
cause
for
any
excitement

get
what
you
can
in
the
way
of

and
come

soon
as
you
can
she

torn
to
bits
below
but
she
will
not
sink
if
her
after
bulkheads
it
seemed
almost
impossible
that
this
could
be
true
and
many
in
the
crowd
smiled
thinking
this
was
merely
a
little
extra
knowledge
that
andrews
saw
fit
to
impart
it
is
almost
certain
that
andrews
who
knew
the
ship
as
no
one
else
did
realised
at
his
first
sight
of
her
three
hundred
feet
gash
six
compartments
open
to
the
sea
and
perhaps
twenty
feet
of
water
in
one
or
more
of
she
was
doomed
possibly
with
some
of
his
faithful
assistants
probably
with
captain
smith
he
had
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
damaged
side
reporting
to
the
captain
as
result
of
his
examination
that
the
ship
could
not
live
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
and
advising
him
to
clear
away
the
boats
how
this
order
was
carried
out
with
what
skill
and
unselfishness
on
the
part
of
captain
smith
and
his
officers
has
been
told
elsewhere
in
full
detail
nor
is
it
necessary
to
record
further
here
than
that
eventually
after
two
hours
of
heroic
work
a
total
of
lives
left
the
in
eighteen
boats
subsequently
more
were
rescued
from
the
sea
or
transferred
from
the
collapsibles
making
a
sum
total
of
rescued
by
the
out
of
it
seems
tragically
few
yet
at
midnight
it
may
have
seemed
to
andrews
that
fewer
still
could
be
saved
for
not
even
he
hoped
that
his
ship
could
live
for
two
hours
and

minutes
more
mersey
commission
report
pp
as
he
came
up
from
the
grim
work
of
investigation
he
saw
miss
sloan
and
told
her
that
as
an
accident
had
happened
it
would
be
well
just
by
way
of
precaution
to
get
her
passengers
to
put
on
warm
clothing
and
their
life
belts
and
assemble
on
the
boat
deck
but
she
read
his
face
which
had
a
look
as
though
he
were
heart
broken
and
asked
him
if
the
accident
were
not
serious
he
said
it
was
very
serious
then
bidding
her
keep
the
bad
news
quiet
for
fear
of
panic
he
hurried
away
to
the
work
of
warning
and
rescue
another
stewardess
gives
an
account
of
andrews
bareheaded
and
insufficiently
clad
against
the
icy
cold
going
quietly
about
bidding
the
attendants
to
rouse
all
passengers
and
get
them
up
to
the
boats
overhearing
him
say
to
captain
smith
on
the
upper
deck
well
three
have
gone
already
captain
she
ran
to
the
lower
stairway
and
to
her
surprise
found
water
within
six
steps
of
her
feet
whereupon
she
hurried
above
to
summon
help
and
returning
met
andrews
who
told
her
to
advise
passengers
to
leave
the
upper
deck
ten
minutes
went
the
water
had
crept
further
up
the
stairway
again
andrews
came
to
her
and
said
tell
them
to
put
on
warm
clothing
see
that
everyone
has
a
lifebelt
and
get
them
all
up
to
the
boat
another
fifteen
minutes
went
the
top
of
the
stairway
was
now
nearly
awash
a
second
time
andrews
came
open
up
all
the
spare
rooms
he
ordered
take
out
all
lifebelts
and
spare
blankets
and
distribute
this
was
done
attendants
and
passengers
went
above
to
the
boat
deck
but
returning
for
more
belts
the
stewardess
again
met
andrews
he
asked
her
whether
all
the
ladies
had
left
their
rooms
she
answered
yes
but
would
make
go
round
again
said
he
and
then
did
i
not
tell
you
to
put
on
your
lifebelt
surely
you
have
one
she
answered
yes
but
i
thought
it
means
to
wear
never
mind
that
said
he
now
if
you
value
your
life
put
on
your
coat
and
belt
then
walk
round
the
deck
and
let
the
passengers
see
he
left
me
then
writes
the
stewardess
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
what
i
consider
a
true
hero
and
one
of
whom
his
country
has
cause
to
be
in
how
far
andrews
efforts
and
example
were
the
means
of
averting
what
might
well
have
been
an
awful
panic
can
not
be
said
but
sure
it
is
that
all
one
man
could
do
in
such
service
both
personally
and
by
way
of
assisting
the
ship
s
officers
was
done
by
him
he
was
here
there
and
everywhere
says
miss
sloan
looking
after
everybody
telling
the
women
to
put
on
lifebelts
telling
the
stewardesses
to
hurry
the
women
up
to
the
boats
all
about
everywhere
thinking
of
everyone
but
others
tell
a
similar
story
how
calm
and
unselfish
he
was
now
pausing
on
his
way
to
the
to
reassure
some
passengers
now
earnestly
begging
women
to
be
quick
now
helping
one
to
put
on
her
all
about
everywhere
thinking
of
everybody
but
it
is
certain
also
that
on
the
boat
deck
he
gave
invaluable
help
to
the
officers
and
men
engaged
in
the
work
of
rescue
being
familiar
with
the
boats
tackle
and
arrangement
he
was
able
to
aid
effectively
at
their
launching
and
it
was
whilst
going
quietly
from
boat
to
boat
probably
in
those
tragic
intervals
during
which
the
stewardess
watched
the
water
creep
up
the
stairway
that
he
was
heard
to
say
now
men
remember
you
are
englishmen
women
and
children
some
twenty
minutes
before
the
end
when
the
last
distress
signal
had
been
fired
in
vain
when
all
that
upper
deck
and
the
fore
deck
as
well
were
ravaged
by
the
sea
there
was
a
crush
and
a
little
confusion
near
the
place
where
the
few
remaining
boats
were
being
lowered
women
and
children
shrinking
back
some
afraid
to
venture
some
preferring
to
stay
with
their
husbands
a
few
perhaps
in
the
grip
of
cold
and
terror
then
andrews
came
and
waving
his
arms
gave
loud
command
ladies
you
must
get
in
at
once
there
is
not
a
minute
to
lose
you
can
not
pick
and
choose
your
boat
don
t
hesitate
get
in
get
in
they
obeyed
him
do
they
remember
any
of
them
that
to
him
they
as
so
many
more
may
owe
their
lives
a
little
way
back
from
that
scene
miss
sloan
stood
calmly
waiting
and
seeing
andrews
for
the
last
time
she
herself
was
not
very
anxious
to
leave
the
ship
for
all
her
friends
were
staying
behind
and
she
felt
it
was
mean
to
go
but
the
command
of
the
man
who
for
nearly
two
hours
she
had
seen
doing
as
splendidly
as
now
he
was
doing
came
imperatively
don
t
hesitate
there
s
not
a
moment
to
lose
get
in
so
she
stepped
into
the
last
boat
and
was
saved
it
was
then
five
minutes
past
two
the
had
fifteen
minutes
more
to
live
well
all
was
done
now
that
could
be
done
and
the
time
remaining
was
short
the
forecastle
head
was
under
water
all
around
out
on
the
sea
so
calm
under
those
wonderful
stars
the
boats
were
scattered
some
near
some
a
mile
away
or
more
the
eyes
of
most
in
them
turned
back
upon
the
doomed
ship
as
one
by
one
her
port
lights
that
still
burnt
row
above
row
in
dreadful
sloping
lines
sank
slowly
into
darkness
soon
the
lines
would
tilt
upright
then
flash
out
and
flash
bright
again
then
as
the
engines
crashed
down
through
the
bulkheads
go
out
once
more
and
leave
that
awful
form
standing
up
against
the
sky
motionless
black
preparing
for
the
final
plunge
but
that
time
was
not
yet
some
fifteen
minutes
were
left
and
in
those
minutes
we
still
have
sight
of
andrews
one
met
him
bareheaded
and
carrying
a
lifebelt
on
his
way
to
the
bridge
perhaps
to
bid
the
captain
goodbye
later
an
assistant
steward
saw
him
standing
alone
in
the
his
arms
folded
over
his
breast
and
the
belt
lying
on
a
table
near
him
the
steward
asked
him
aren
t
you
going
to
have
a
try
for
it
andrews
he
never
answered
or
moved
just
stood
like
one
what
did
he
see
as
he
stood
there
alone
rapt
we
who
know
the
man
and
his
record
can
believe
that
before
him
was
home
and
all
the
loved
ones
there
wife
and
child
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sister
relatives
picture
and
all
it
meant
to
him
then
and
there
and
besides
just
for
a
moment
maybe
and
as
background
to
all
that
swift
realisation
of
the
awful
tragedy
ending
his
life
ending
his
ship
but
whatever
he
saw
in
that
quiet
lonely
minute
it
did
not
hold
or
unman
him
must
work
to
the
bitter
end
some
saw
him
for
the
last
time
down
in
the
with
chief
engineer
bell
and
archie
frost
and
the
other
heroes
all
toiling
like
men
to
keep
the
lights
going
and
the
pumps
at
work
others
saw
him
a
few
minutes
before
the
end
on
the
boat
deck
our
final
and
grandest
sight
of
him
throwing
deck
chairs
overboard
to
the
unfortunates
struggling
in
the
water
below
then
with
a
slow
long
slanting
dive
the
went
down
giving
to
the
sea
her
life
and
with
it
the
life
of
thomas
andrews
so
died
this
noble
man
we
may
hope
that
he
lies
as
indeed
he
might
be
proud
to
lie
in
the
great
ship

had
helped
to
fashion

did
more
for
the
white
star
line
or
was
more
loyal
to
its
interests
than
your
good
husband
and
i
always
placed
the
utmost
reliance
on
his
judgment
if
we
miss
him
and
feel
his
loss
so
keenly
what
your
feelings
must
be
i
can
not
think
words
at
such
a
time
are
useless
but
i
could
not
help
writing
to
you
to
tell
you
how
truly
deeply
i
feel
for
you
in
your
grief
and
sorrow
yours

my
dear

no
act
of
friendship
is
so
difficult
as
the
letter
of
condolence
upon
the
loss
of
one
who
is
near
and
dear
strive
as
we
may
to
avoid
vapid
conventionality
we
find
ourselves
drifting
into
reflections
upon
the
course
of
nature
the
cessation
of
suffering
the
worse
that
might
have
been
and
such
offers
of
comfort
to
others
which
we
are
conscious
would
be
of
little
help
to
ourselves
in
writing
to
you
and
your
wife
on
the
sorrow
of
two
worlds
which
has
fallen
so
heavily
upon
your
home
and
family
i
feel
no
such
difficulty
there
is
no
temptation
to
be
conventional
but
it
is
hard
to
express
in
words
the
very
real
consolation
which
will
long
be
cherished
by
the
wide
circle
of
those
now
bitterly
deploring
the
early
death
of
one
who
was
clearly
marked
out
for
a
great
career
in
the
chief
part
of
irish
life
of
the
worth
of
your
son
i
need
not
speak
to
i
could
say
of
his
character
or
capacity
could
add
to
your
pride
in
him
but
you
ought
to
know
that
we
all
feel
how
entirely
to
his
own
merits
was
due
the
extraordinary
rapidity
of
his
rise
and
the
acknowledged
certainty
of
his
leadership
in
what
ulster
stands
for
before
the
world
when
i
first
saw
him
in
the
shipyard
he
was
in
a
humble
position
enjoying
no
advantage
on
account
of
your
relationship
to
one
of
his
employers
even
then
as
on
many
subsequent
occasions
i
learned
or
heard
from
my
irish
that
this
splendid
son
of
yours
had
the
best
kind
of
public
which
made
you
and
sinclair
save
the
recess
committee
at
its
crisis
it
may
be
that
the
story
of
your
poor
boy
s
death
will
never
be
told
but
i
seem
to
see
it
all
i
have
just
come
off
the
sister
ship
whose
captain
was
a
personal
friend
as
was
the
old
doctor
who
went
with
him
to
the
i
have
been
often
in
the
fog
among
the
icebergs
i
have
heard
in
over
sixty
voyages
many
of
those
awful
tales
of
the
sea
i
know
enough
to
be
aware
that
your
son
might
easily
have
saved
himself
on
grounds
of
public
duty
none
could
gainsay
what
better
witness
could
be
found
to
tell
the
millions
who
would
want
and
had
a
right
to
know
why
the
great
ship
failed
and
how
her
successors
could
be
made
as
she
was
believed
to
be
unsinkable
none
of
his
breed
could
listen
to
such
promptings
of
the
lower
self
when
the
call
came
to
show
to
what
height
the
real
man
in
him
could
rise
i
think
of
him
displaying
the
very
highest
quality
of
true
any
of
the
stimulants
which
the
glamour
and
prizes
of
battle
all
he
could
for
the
women
and
then
going
grimly
and
silently
to
his
glorious
grave
so
there
is
a
bright
side
to
the
picture
which
you
of
his
blood
and
his
widow
must
try
to
share
with
his
and
your
the
thousands
who
will
treasure
his
memory
it
will
help
you
in
your
bereavement
and
that
is
why
i
intrude
upon
your
sorrow
with
a
longer
letter
than
would
suffice
to
tender
to
you
and
andrews
and
to
all
your
family
circle
a
tribute
of
heartfelt
sympathy
pray
accept
this
as
coming
not
only
from
myself
but
also
from
those
intimately
associated
with
me
in
the
irish
work
which
brought
me
among
other
blessings
the
friendship
of
men
like
yourself
believe
me
yours
always
