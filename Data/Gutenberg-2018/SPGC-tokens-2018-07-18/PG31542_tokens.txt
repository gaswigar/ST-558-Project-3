pierre
plunged
into
the
subway
a
feverish
a
brutal
crowd
on
his
feet
near
the
door
closely
pressed
in
a
bank
of
human
bodies
and
sharing
the
heavy
atmosphere
passing
in
and
out
of
their
mouths
he
stared
without
seeing
them
at
the
black
and
rumbling
vaults
over
which
flickered
the
shining
eyes
of
the
train
the
same
heavy
shadows
lay
in
his
mind
the
same
gleams
hard
and
tremulous
suffocating
in
the
raised
collar
of
his
overcoat
his
arms
jammed
against
his
sides
and
his
lips
compressed
his
forehead
damp
with
perspiration
momentarily
cooled
by
a
current
from
outside
when
the
door
opened
he
tried
hard
not
to
see
he
tried
not
to
breathe
he
tried
not
to
live
the
heart
of
this
young
fellow
of
eighteen
still
almost
a
child
was
full
of
a
dull
despair
above
his
head
above
the
shadows
of
these
long
vaulted
ways
of
this
through
which
the
monster
of
metal
whirled
all
swarming
with
human
masks
was
paris
the
snow
the
cold
january
darkness
the
nightmare
of
life
and
of
death
the
war
the
war
four
years
ago
it
was
the
war
had
come
to
stay
it
had
weighed
heavily
on
his
adolescent
years
it
had
caught
him
by
surprise
in
that
morally
critical
period
when
the
growing
boy
disquieted
by
the
awakening
of
his
feelings
discovers
with
a
shock
the
existence
of
blind
bestial
crushing
forces
in
life
whose
prey
he
is
and
that
without
having
asked
to
live
at
all
and
if
he
happens
to
be
delicate
in
character
tender
of
heart
and
frail
as
to
body
in
the
way
pierre
was
he
experiences
a
disgust
and
horror
which
he
does
not
dare
confide
to
others
for
all
these
brutalities
these
nastinesses
all
this
nonsense
of
fruitful
and
devouring
nature
this
breeding
sow
that
gobbles
up
her
litter
of
pigs
in
every
growing
youth
between
sixteen
and
eighteen
there
is
a
bit
of
the
soul
of
hamlet
do
ask
him
to
understand
the
war
all
right
for
you
men
who
have
had
your
fill
he
has
all
he
can
do
to
understand
life
and
forgive
its
existence
as
a
rule
he
digs
himself
in
with
his
dream
and
with
the
arts
until
the
time
comes
when
he
has
got
used
to
his
incarnation
and
the
grub
has
achieved
its
agonizing
passage
from
larva
to
winged
insect
what
a
need
he
has
for
peace
and
meditation
during
these
april
days
so
full
of
the
trouble
of
maturing
life
but
they
come
after
him
to
the
bottom
of
his
burrow
look
him
up
drag
him
from
the
dark
while
still
so
tender
in
his
skin
they
toss
him
into
the
raw
air
amongst
the
hard
human
race
whose
follies
and
hatreds
he
is
expected
at
the
very
first
moment
to
accept
without
understanding
them
and
not
understanding
to
atone
for
them
pierre
had
been
called
to
military
service
along
with
those
of
his
own
class
boys
of
sixteen
to
eighteen
within
six
months
his
country
would
be
needing
his
flesh
the
war
claimed
him
six
months
of
respite
six
months
oh
if
one
could
only
stop
thinking
at
all
from
this
time
to
that
just
to
stay
in
this
underground
tunnel
never
see
cruel
daylight
any
more
he
plunged
deeper
into
his
gloom
along
with
the
flying
train
and
closed
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
again
a
few
steps
away
but
separated
by
the
bodies
of
two
strangers
stood
a
young
girl
who
had
just
entered
at
first
all
he
saw
of
her
was
a
delicate
profile
under
the
shadow
of
her
hat
one
blonde
curl
on
a
somewhat
thin
cheek
a
highlight
perched
upon
the
smooth
cheekbone
the
fine
line
of
nose
and
lifted
upper
lip
and
her
mouth
slightly
parted
still
quivering
a
little
from
her
sudden
rush
into
the
car
through
the
portals
of
his
eyes
into
his
heart
she
entered
she
entered
all
complete
and
the
door
closed
noises
from
without
fell
to
nothing
silence
peace
she
was
there
she
did
not
look
at
him
in
fact
she
did
not
even
know
as
yet
of
his
existence
and
yet
she
was
there
inside
him
he
held
her
image
there
speechless
crushed
in
his
arms
and
he
dared
not
breathe
for
fear
that
his
breath
might
ruffle
her
a
jostling
at
the
next
station
noisily
talking
the
crowd
threw
themselves
into
the
already
packed
carriage
pierre
found
himself
shoved
and
carried
along
by
the
human
wave
above
the
tunnel
vault
in
the
city
up
there
certain
dull
reports
the
train
started
up
again
at
that
moment
a
man
quite
out
of
his
senses
who
covered
up
his
face
with
his
hands
came
running
down
the
stairway
of
the
station
and
rolled
down
on
the
floor
at
the
bottom
there
was
just
enough
time
to
catch
sight
of
the
blood
that
trickled
through
his
fingers
then
the
tunnel
and
darkness
again
in
the
car
frightened
outcries
the
gothas
are
at
it
again
during
the
general
excitement
which
fused
these
closely
packed
bodies
into
one
his
hand
had
seized
the
hand
that
touched
him
and
when
he
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
it
was
she
she
did
not
pull
her
hand
away
at
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
hers
replied
in
a
sympathy
of
emotion
drawing
together
a
bit
and
then
letting
themselves
go
soft
and
burning
without
budging
thus
the
two
remained
in
the
protective
darkness
their
hands
like
two
birds
hid
in
the
same
nest
and
the
blood
from
their
hearts
ran
in
a
single
flood
through
the
warmth
of
their
palms
they
said
no
word
to
one
another
his
mouth
almost
touched
the
curl
on
her
cheek
and
the
tip
of
her
ear
they
did
not
make
a
gesture
she
did
not
look
at
him
two
stations
beyond
she
loosed
her
hand
from
his
which
did
not
keep
her
slipped
between
the
bodies
and
left
without
having
looked
at
him
when
she
had
vanished
it
occurred
to
him
to
follow
too
late
the
train
was
in
motion
at
the
next
stop
he
ran
up
to
the
surface
there
he
found
the
nocturnal
cold
the
unseen
touches
of
some
flakes
of
snow
and
the
city
frightened
and
amused
at
its
fright
above
it
very
high
in
the
air
circled
the
warlike
birds
but
he
saw
only
her
the
one
who
was
within
him
and
he
reached
home
holding
the
hand
of
the
unknown
girl
pierre
aubier
lived
with
his
parents
near
cluny
square
his
father
was
a
municipal
judge
his
brother
older
than
he
by
six
years
had
volunteered
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
a
good
sound
family
of
the
class
excellent
folks
affectionate
and
human
never
having
dared
to
think
for
themselves
and
very
probably
never
imagining
that
such
a
thing
could
be
profoundly
honest
and
with
a
lofty
sense
of
the
duties
of
his
office
judge
aubier
would
have
rejected
with
indignation
as
a
supreme
insult
the
suspicion
even
that
the
verdicts
he
announced
could
have
been
dictated
by
any
other
considerations
than
those
of
equity
and
his
own
conscience
but
the
voice
of
his
conscience
had
never
spoken
let
us
better
say
whispered
against
the
government
for
that
conscience
was
born
a
functionary
it
registered
thoughts
as
a
state
function
variable
but
infallible
established
powers
were
invested
by
him
with
a
sacred
truth
he
admired
sincerely
those
souls
of
iron
the
great
free
and
unbending
magistrates
of
the
past
and
perhaps
secretly
believed
himself
to
be
of
their
stock
he
was
a
very
small
edition
of
michel
de
over
whom
a
century
of
republican
slavery
had
passed
as
to
madame
aubier
she
was
as
good
a
christian
as
her
husband
was
a
good
republican
just
as
sincerely
and
honestly
as
he
made
himself
a
docile
instrument
of
the
government
against
any
form
of
liberty
which
was
not
official
so
did
she
mingle
her
prayers
and
that
in
perfect
purity
of
heart
with
the
homicidal
vows
which
were
made
about
the
war
in
every
country
of
europe
by
the
catholic
priests
the
protestant
ministers
the
rabbis
and
the
popes
the
newspapers
and
the
thinkers
of
the
time
and
both
of
them
father
and
mother
adored
their
children
and
like
true
french
people
had
for
them
only
a
profound
essential
affection
would
have
sacrificed
everything
for
them
and
yet
in
order
to
do
as
others
would
sacrifice
them
without
hesitation
to
whom
why
to
the
unknown
god
in
every
epoch
abraham
has
led
isaac
to
the
funeral
pile
and
his
magnificent
folly
still
remains
an
example
for
poor
human
beings
as
often
is
the
case
at
this
family
hearth
affection
was
great
and
intimacy
null
how
should
thoughts
communicate
freely
from
one
to
the
other
when
each
one
forbore
a
look
into
the
bottom
of
his
own
mind
whatever
one
may
feel
one
knows
that
certain
dogmas
at
any
rate
must
be
blinked
set
aside
and
if
it
already
amounts
to
an
embarrassment
when
the
dogmas
are
discreet
enough
to
stay
within
the
limits
traced
for
them
that
was
the
case
to
sum
all
up
of
those
belonging
to
the
beyond
what
is
to
be
said
when
they
pretend
to
mix
themselves
with
life
to
rule
life
entirely
as
our
laical
and
obligatory
dogmas
actually
do
just
you
try
to
forget
the
dogma
of
your
country
the
new
religion
compelled
a
return
to
the
old
testament
it
was
not
to
be
made
comfortable
with
lip
devotion
and
innocent
rituals
hygienic
and
ridiculous
like
confession
friday
fasting
rest
on
sunday
which
once
upon
a
time
incited
the
racy
spirit
of
our
philosophers
during
the
period
when
the
people
were
free
under
the
kings
the
new
religion
wanted
all
was
not
satisfied
with
less
all
the
man
complete
his
body
his
blood
his
life
and
his
thinking
mind
above
all
his
blood
since
the
time
of
the
aztecs
of
mexico
never
was
there
a
divinity
so
gorged
with
blood
it
would
be
deeply
unjust
to
say
that
the
believers
did
not
suffer
from
this
they
suffered
but
they
believed
alas
my
poor
brother
men
for
whom
suffering
itself
is
a
proof
positive
of
the
divine
and
aubier
suffered
like
the
others
and
like
the
others
adored
but
from
a
growing
boy
one
could
not
demand
such
abnegation
of
heart
feeling
and
good
sense
pierre
would
have
liked
to
comprehend
at
least
what
it
was
that
oppressed
him
what
a
lot
of
questions
burned
within
which
he
could
not
utter
for
the
very
first
word
of
all
was
but
what
if
i
do
believe
in
it
at
all
a
blasphemy
just
to
start
with
no
he
could
not
speak
out
they
would
have
gazed
at
him
in
a
stupor
frightened
indignant
with
sorrow
and
shame
and
since
he
was
at
that
plastic
age
when
the
soul
with
a
bark
still
too
tender
wrinkles
up
at
the
slightest
breeze
that
comes
from
outside
and
under
its
furtive
fingers
molds
its
form
shudderingly
he
felt
himself
beforehand
sorrowful
and
ashamed
ah
how
they
believed
all
of
them
but
did
they
really
all
of
them
believe
how
was
it
they
managed
it
then
one
did
not
dare
to
ask
not
to
believe
standing
all
alone
among
all
those
who
do
believe
is
like
one
who
lacks
some
organ
superfluous
perchance
but
one
that
all
the
others
possess
and
so
blushing
one
hides
one
nudity
from
the
public
the
only
one
who
was
able
to
comprehend
the
tortures
of
the
young
fellow
was
his
elder
brother
pierre
had
for
philip
that
adoration
which
the
younger
ones
often
have
but
which
they
jealously
conceal
for
the
older
brother
or
sister
some
stranger
comrade
at
times
merely
the
vision
of
an
hour
and
lost
again
who
realizes
in
their
eyes
the
dream
at
once
of
what
they
could
wish
to
be
and
of
what
they
would
like
to
love
chaste
ardors
and
troublesome
of
the
future
formed
of
mixing
currents
the
big
brother
was
aware
of
this
naïve
homage
and
was
flattered
by
it
not
so
long
ago
he
had
tried
to
read
the
heart
of
the
little
brother
and
explain
things
to
him
with
discretion
for
although
more
robust
like
him
he
was
molded
of
that
fine
clay
which
among
the
better
sort
of
men
retains
a
little
of
the
woman
and
does
not
blush
to
own
it
but
the
war
had
come
and
torn
him
away
from
his
hard
working
career
from
his
study
of
the
sciences
from
his
dream
and
from
his
intimacy
with
his
young
brother
he
had
dropped
everything
in
the
intoxicating
idealism
of
the
moment
like
a
big
crazy
bird
that
launches
out
into
space
with
the
heroic
and
absurd
illusion
that
his
beak
and
his
talons
will
put
an
end
to
the
war
and
restore
to
earth
the
reign
of
peace
since
then
the
big
bird
had
returned
two
or
three
times
to
the
nest
each
time
alas
a
little
more
worn
in
plumage
he
had
come
back
denuded
of
many
of
his
illusions
but
he
found
himself
too
much
mortified
about
them
to
acknowledge
it
he
was
ashamed
to
have
believed
in
them
folly
not
to
have
known
how
to
see
life
as
it
is
now
he
set
his
heart
upon
dissipating
its
enchantment
and
accepting
it
stoically
whatsoever
it
might
turn
out
not
himself
alone
did
he
punish
a
wretched
suffering
urged
him
to
punish
his
illusions
in
the
heart
of
his
young
brother
where
he
found
that
they
held
their
own
at
his
first
coming
back
when
pierre
had
run
up
to
him
burning
in
his
heart
he
had
been
frozen
at
once
by
the
welcome
his
elder
gave
him
affectionate
certainly
always
affectionate
but
with
a
certain
harsh
irony
in
his
tone
hard
to
fathom
questions
that
pressed
forward
to
his
lips
were
pushed
back
on
the
instant
philip
had
seen
them
coming
and
cut
them
down
with
a
word
with
a
look
after
two
or
three
attempts
pierre
drew
back
with
an
aching
heart
he
did
not
recognize
his
brother
any
more
the
other
recognized
him
only
too
well
he
perceived
in
him
what
he
himself
had
been
not
so
long
ago
and
what
never
he
could
be
again
he
made
him
pay
for
it
it
caused
him
regret
afterward
but
of
that
he
showed
no
sign
and
just
began
over
again
both
of
them
suffered
and
through
a
too
common
misunderstanding
their
suffering
so
much
alike
so
near
which
ought
to
have
brought
them
together
only
separated
them
the
sole
difference
between
them
was
that
the
elder
knew
that
it
was
near
while
pierre
believed
himself
alone
in
his
suffering
with
nobody
to
whom
he
could
open
his
soul
then
why
did
he
not
turn
toward
those
of
his
own
age
his
companions
at
school
it
might
seem
as
if
these
growing
youths
ought
to
have
come
close
to
one
another
and
mutually
given
one
another
support
but
nothing
of
the
kind
on
the
contrary
a
sorrowful
fatality
kept
them
separate
scattered
in
little
groups
and
even
in
the
inner
circle
of
these
minim
groups
kept
them
distant
and
reserved
the
commoner
sort
had
plunged
eyes
closed
head
foremost
into
the
current
of
the
war
the
larger
number
drew
themselves
away
and
did
not
feel
any
connection
with
the
generations
that
preceded
them
they
did
not
partake
in
any
way
of
their
passions
their
hopes
and
their
hatreds
they
were
bystanders
beside
all
the
frantic
like
men
who
are
sober
looking
on
at
those
who
are
drunk
but
what
could
they
do
in
opposition
many
had
started
little
magazines
reviews
whose
ephemeral
lives
were
snuffed
out
after
the
first
numbers
for
lack
of
air
the
censorship
produced
a
vacuum
the
entire
thought
of
france
was
under
the
pneumatic
exhausting
bell
among
these
young
fellows
the
most
distinguished
ones
too
feeble
to
rebel
and
too
proud
to
complain
knew
beforehand
that
they
were
delivered
up
to
the
sword
of
war
while
they
waited
for
their
turn
at
the
slaughterhouse
they
looked
on
and
made
their
judgments
in
silence
each
one
by
himself
with
a
little
surprise
and
a
great
deal
of
irony
through
a
disdainful
reaction
against
the
mental
condition
of
the
herd
they
fell
back
into
a
kind
of
egotism
intellectual
and
artistic
egotism
an
idealistic
sensualism
where
the
tracked
and
hunted
ego
vindicated
its
rights
against
human
fellowship
laughable
fellowship
which
made
itself
manifest
to
these
adolescents
only
in
the
shape
of
finished
murder
one
undergone
in
common
a
precocious
experience
had
shriveled
their
illusions
they
had
seen
how
much
those
same
illusions
were
worth
in
their
elders
and
how
those
who
did
not
believe
in
them
paid
for
them
with
their
lives
even
as
to
those
of
their
own
age
and
as
to
man
in
general
their
confidence
was
shaken
and
besides
at
such
a
time
it
cost
something
to
confide
in
people
every
day
one
learned
of
some
denunciation
of
thoughts
and
intimate
conversations
by
a
patriotic
spy
whose
zeal
the
government
honored
and
stimulated
so
it
was
that
these
young
people
through
discouragement
through
disdain
through
prudence
through
a
stoical
sense
of
their
solitude
in
thought
gave
themselves
very
little
indeed
the
one
to
the
other
pierre
could
not
find
among
them
that
horatio
whom
little
hamlets
seek
if
he
had
a
horror
of
estranging
his
thought
from
public
opinion
that
public
woman
he
did
feel
the
need
of
joining
it
freely
with
souls
of
his
own
choosing
he
was
too
tender
to
be
able
to
content
himself
with
himself
he
suffered
from
the
universal
suffering
that
crushed
him
by
the
amount
of
its
pain
which
he
exaggerated
for
if
humanity
does
support
it
in
spite
of
everything
that
is
because
humanity
has
a
harder
hide
than
is
the
delicate
skin
of
a
frail
boy
but
what
he
did
not
exaggerate
and
what
weighed
him
down
much
more
than
the
suffering
of
the
world
was
the
imbecility
of
it
all
it
is
nothing
to
undergo
pain
it
is
nothing
to
die
if
only
one
can
see
a
reason
for
it
sacrifice
is
a
good
thing
when
one
understands
why
it
is
made
but
what
is
this
why
what
is
the
sense
of
this
world
and
its
harrowings
for
a
youth
if
he
be
sincere
and
sound
of
mind
in
what
way
can
he
interest
himself
in
the
coarse
medley
of
nations
standing
head
to
head
like
stupid
rams
on
the
brink
of
an
abyss
into
which
all
are
about
to
tumble
and
yet
the
road
was
broad
enough
for
all
why
then
this
madness
to
destroy
oneself
why
these
countries
given
over
to
pride
these
states
devoted
to
rapine
these
peoples
to
whom
is
taught
murder
as
if
murder
were
their
duty
but
wherefore
this
butchery
everywhere
among
living
beings
why
this
world
that
devours
itself
to
what
purpose
the
nightmare
of
that
monstrous
and
endless
chain
of
life
each
one
of
whose
links
sets
its
jaws
into
the
neck
of
the
other
feasts
on
its
flesh
delights
in
its
suffering
and
lives
through
its
death
why
the
conflict
and
why
the
pain
why
death
why
life
why
why
that
night
when
the
boy
got
home
the
why
had
ceased
its
cry
nevertheless
nothing
had
changed
there
he
was
in
his
own
room
littered
with
papers
and
books
all
about
the
familiar
sounds
in
the
street
the
trumpet
sounding
the
close
of
the
warning
against
on
the
house
stairs
the
reassured
gossip
of
the
tenants
coming
up
from
the
cellar
in
the
story
overhead
the
crazy
marching
to
and
fro
of
the
old
neighbor
who
for
months
had
been
waiting
for
his
vanished
son
but
here
in
his
own
chamber
lay
no
longer
those
cares
of
his
in
ambush
which
he
had
left
there
sometimes
it
happens
that
an
incomplete
accord
in
music
sounds
raucous
in
a
way
it
leaves
the
mind
disquieted
up
to
the
moment
when
some
note
is
added
which
procures
a
fusion
of
the
hostile
or
coldly
alien
elements
like
visitors
who
do
not
know
one
another
and
wait
to
be
introduced
at
once
the
ice
is
broken
and
harmony
spreads
from
one
member
of
the
group
to
another
this
moral
chemistry
had
just
been
put
in
operation
by
a
warm
and
furtive
contact
of
hands
pierre
was
not
conscious
of
the
reason
for
the
change
he
never
dreamed
of
analyzing
but
he
felt
that
the
habitual
hostility
of
things
in
general
had
suddenly
softened
a
shooting
pain
takes
possession
of
your
head
for
hours
of
a
sudden
you
perceive
it
is
no
longer
there
how
was
it
that
it
went
scarcely
a
feeling
of
buzzing
about
the
temples
to
recall
it
pierre
was
a
bit
suspicious
of
this
calm
he
suspected
that
it
concealed
under
a
passing
truce
a
much
worse
return
of
the
pain
which
was
merely
taking
breath
already
was
he
acquainted
with
the
respites
that
are
obtained
through
the
arts
when
into
our
eyes
penetrate
the
divine
proportions
of
lines
and
colors
or
into
the
voluptuous
windings
of
the
sonorous
the
lovely
varied
play
of
accords
which
combine
and
interlock
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
harmonious
numbers
peace
takes
possession
of
us
and
joy
inundates
our
souls
but
that
is
a
radiance
which
comes
from
outside
one
would
say
from
a
sun
the
distant
fires
of
which
hold
us
in
suspense
fascinated
lifted
high
above
our
life
it
endures
only
a
moment
and
then
one
falls
again
art
is
never
more
than
a
passing
forgetfulness
of
the
actual
the
real
pierre
was
afraid
and
fully
expected
the
same
but
this
time
the
radiation
came
from
within
nothing
that
belongs
to
life
was
forgot
but
everything
fell
into
harmony
his
recollections
his
new
thoughts
even
to
the
familiar
objects
about
him
the
books
and
papers
in
his
chamber
sprang
alive
and
took
on
an
interest
which
they
had
lost
for
months
past
his
intellectual
growth
had
been
compressed
like
a
young
tree
which
is
struck
in
full
blossoming
by
the
saints
of
the
ice
he
did
not
belong
to
those
practical
boys
who
profit
by
the
indulgence
offered
at
universities
to
the
younger
classes
just
about
to
be
called
to
the
colors
in
order
to
pull
out
hastily
a
diploma
from
under
the
indulgent
eyes
of
the
examiners
nor
was
he
one
to
feel
the
despairing
eagerness
of
the
young
man
who
sees
death
approaching
and
so
takes
double
mouthfuls
and
devours
the
arts
and
sciences
which
he
will
never
have
a
chance
to
test
and
verify
in
life
that
perpetual
feeling
of
emptiness
at
the
end
emptiness
that
is
underneath
and
everywhere
hidden
beneath
the
cruel
and
absurd
illusion
of
the
world
this
it
was
that
swept
aside
all
his
enthusiasms
he
would
throw
himself
on
a
book
on
a
thought
then
he
stopped
discouraged
whither
would
that
lead
what
the
use
of
learning
what
is
the
point
of
getting
riches
if
it
be
necessary
to
lose
everything
leave
everything
if
nothing
really
belongs
to
you
in
order
that
activity
in
order
that
science
should
have
any
sense
it
is
necessary
that
life
should
have
some
this
sense
no
effort
of
the
mind
no
supplication
from
the
heart
had
been
able
to
produce
for
and
yet
lo
and
behold
all
of
itself
this
sense
had
come
life
had
some
sense
what
then
and
seeking
to
find
whence
came
this
inner
smile
he
beheld
the
parted
lips
upon
which
his
mouth
was
burning
to
press
itself
in
ordinary
times
no
doubt
this
wordless
fascination
would
not
have
persisted
at
that
period
of
upgrowth
when
one
is
a
lover
of
love
one
sees
love
in
every
eye
the
greedy
and
uncertain
heart
gathers
it
flitting
from
one
to
the
other
and
nothing
forces
it
to
settle
down
the
heart
is
just
beginning
its
day
but
the
day
at
the
present
period
will
be
a
short
one
it
is
necessary
to
hurry
up
the
heart
of
this
young
fellow
was
in
a
hurry
all
the
greater
because
it
was
so
much
behindhand
great
cities
which
from
a
distance
appear
like
the
smoking
solfataras
of
sensuality
really
harbor
fresh
souls
and
ingenuous
bodies
how
many
young
men
and
young
girls
there
are
who
respect
love
and
keep
their
senses
virgin
up
to
the
marriage
day
even
in
the
refined
circles
where
mental
curiosity
is
precociously
excited
what
singular
ignorances
conceal
themselves
under
the
free
talk
of
some
young
worldly
girl
or
of
some
student
who
knows
everything
and
understands
nothing
in
the
heart
of
paris
there
are
provinces
most
naïve
little
gardens
as
of
cloisters
pure
existences
as
of
springs
paris
permits
herself
to
be
betrayed
by
her
literature
those
who
speak
in
her
name
are
the
most
soiled
of
all
and
besides
one
only
knows
too
well
that
a
false
human
consideration
often
prevents
the
pure
from
avowing
their
pierre
did
not
yet
understand
love
and
he
was
delivered
up
to
the
first
appeal
love
made
this
also
added
to
the
enchantment
of
his
thought
that
love
had
been
born
under
the
wing
of
death
in
that
moment
of
emotion
when
they
felt
the
menace
of
the
bombs
pass
over
their
heads
when
the
bloodstained
apparition
of
the
wounded
man
contracted
their
hearts
then
it
was
their
fingers
groped
toward
each
other
and
both
of
them
had
read
therein
at
the
same
time
with
the
quivering
of
the
flesh
that
was
frightened
the
loving
consolation
of
an
unknown
friend
fleeting
pressure
one
of
the
two
hands
that
of
the
man
says
lean
upon
me
and
the
other
the
maternal
one
pushes
aside
her
own
fear
in
order
to
say
my
little
dear
nothing
of
all
this
was
uttered
or
heard
but
that
inward
murmur
filled
the
soul
far
better
than
words
that
curtain
of
foliage
which
masks
our
thought
pierre
allowed
himself
to
be
cradled
by
this
humming
such
the
song
of
a
golden
wasp
that
floats
through
the
chiaroscuro
of
thought
his
days
became
numb
things
in
this
new
languor
that
solitary
and
naked
heart
dreamed
of
the
warmth
of
a
nest
during
these
first
weeks
of
february
paris
was
counting
her
ruins
from
the
last
raid
and
licking
her
wounds
the
press
locked
up
in
its
kennel
was
barking
for
reprisals
and
according
to
the
statement
of
the
man
who
put
the
fetters
on
the
government
was
making
war
on
the
french
the
open
season
for
suits
at
law
for
treasonable
acts
commenced
the
spectacle
of
a
wretched
creature
who
was
defending
his
own
head
bitterly
demanded
by
the
public
accuser
was
a
matter
of
amusement
for
whose
appetite
for
the
theatre
had
not
yet
been
satisfied
by
four
years
of
war
and
ten
millions
of
dead
men
dissolving
behind
the
flies
but
the
youth
remained
completely
and
solely
absorbed
in
the
mysterious
guest
who
had
just
come
to
make
him
a
visit
strange
intensity
of
these
visions
of
love
printed
on
the
very
floor
of
his
thought
and
nevertheless
lacking
in
contour
pierre
would
have
been
incapable
of
saying
what
was
the
form
of
her
features
or
what
the
color
of
her
eyes
or
the
modeling
of
her
lips
all
he
could
bring
back
was
the
emotion
already
in
himself
all
his
attempts
to
give
precision
to
the
image
merely
ended
in
deforming
it
he
was
no
more
successful
when
he
went
to
work
to
find
her
in
the
streets
of
paris
at
every
turn
he
believed
he
had
seen
her
it
was
either
a
smile
or
a
white
young
neck
or
a
gleam
in
some
eyes
and
then
the
blood
shook
in
his
heart
there
was
no
resemblance
none
whatever
between
these
flying
images
and
the
real
image
which
he
sought
and
which
he
believed
he
loved
well
then
he
did
not
love
her
surely
he
loved
her
and
that
is
why
he
saw
her
everywhere
and
under
every
shape
for
she
just
is
every
smile
each
radiance
all
life
and
the
exact
form
would
be
a
but
one
longs
for
that
limitation
in
order
to
clasp
love
and
to
possess
it
though
he
might
never
see
her
again
he
knew
that
she
existed
she
existed
and
that
she
was
the
nest
in
the
hurricane
a
port
a
lighthouse
in
the
night
maris
oh
love
watch
over
us
at
the
hour
of
death
along
the
quay
of
the
seine
beside
the
institute
he
wandered
looking
with
little
attention
at
the
shelves
of
the
few
who
had
stuck
to
their
posts
he
found
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
of
the
pont
des
arts
raising
his
eyes
he
perceived
her
for
whom
he
had
waited
a
portfolio
of
drawings
under
her
arm
she
came
down
the
steps
like
a
little
doe
he
did
not
reflect
for
the
shadow
of
a
second
he
rushed
forward
to
meet
her
and
while
he
ascended
toward
her
who
was
coming
down
for
the
first
time
their
gaze
rested
the
one
on
the
other
and
entered
arrived
in
front
of
her
and
stopping
short
he
began
to
blush
surprised
seeing
that
he
blushed
she
reddened
too
before
he
could
get
his
breath
again
the
little
deerlike
step
had
already
gone
beyond
him
when
strength
returned
and
he
was
able
to
turn
about
her
skirt
was
disappearing
at
the
turning
of
the
arcade
which
looks
upon
the
rue
de
seine
he
did
not
try
to
follow
her
leaning
against
the
balustrade
of
the
bridge
he
saw
look
in
the
stream
that
flowed
below
for
some
time
his
heart
had
a
pasture
new
oh
dear
stupid
children
a
week
later
he
was
loafing
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
which
the
sun
was
filling
with
a
golden
softness
such
a
radiant
february
in
that
funereal
year
dreaming
with
his
eyes
open
and
hardly
knowing
well
whether
he
was
dreaming
what
he
saw
or
saw
what
he
was
dreaming
steeped
in
a
greedy
languor
obscurely
happy
unhappy
in
love
as
much
filled
full
of
tenderness
as
with
the
sun
he
smiled
as
he
strolled
with
inattentive
eyes
and
without
his
knowing
it
his
lips
moved
reciting
words
without
connection
a
song
of
some
kind
he
looked
down
at
the
sandy
path
and
like
the
wingtip
of
a
dove
that
passes
he
had
an
impression
that
a
smile
had
just
passed
along
he
whirled
about
and
saw
that
he
had
just
crossed
her
path
and
just
at
that
moment
without
stopping
in
her
walk
she
turned
her
head
with
a
smile
in
order
to
observe
him
then
he
hesitated
no
longer
and
went
toward
her
his
hands
almost
extended
in
so
juvenile
and
naïve
a
rush
that
naïvely
she
waited
for
him
he
made
no
excuses
for
himself
there
was
no
awkwardness
between
them
it
seemed
to
them
they
were
continuing
an
interview
already
begun
you
are
laughing
at
me
said
he
you
are
quite
right
i
not
laughing
at
you
her
voice
like
her
step
was
lively
and
supple
you
were
laughing
all
to
yourself
i
merely
laughed
at
seeing
you
was
i
laughing
really
you
are
still
laughing
now
now
i
know
why
she
did
not
ask
him
what
he
meant
they
walked
side
by
side
they
were
happy
what
a
jolly
little
sun
said
she
newly
born
springtide
was
it
to
him
just
now
you
were
sending
that
little
smile
not
to
him
alone
perhaps
to
you
too
little
liar
bad
boy
you
do
even
know
me
as
if
one
could
say
such
a
thing
we
have
seen
each
other
i
do
know
how
often
thrice
counting
this
time
ah
you
remember
then
you
see
that
we
are
old
acquaintances
let
talk
about
it
i
agreed
that
all
i
want
oh
come
let
us
sit
there
just
an
instant
wo
you
please
it
so
nice
at
the
edge
of
the
water
they
were
near
the
galathea
fountain
which
the
masons
had
covered
over
with
tarpaulins
to
protect
it
from
the
bombs
i
really
can
not
i
shall
miss
my
train
she
gave
him
the
hour
he
showed
her
that
she
had
more
than
minutes
yes
but
she
wanted
first
to
buy
her
lunch
at
the
corner
of
rue
racine
where
they
keep
good
little
buns
he
hauled
one
out
of
his
pocket
no
better
than
this
one
do
you
really
want
to
take
it
she
laughed
and
hesitated
he
put
it
in
her
hand
and
kept
hold
of
her
hand
you
would
give
me
such
pleasure
come
now
come
and
sit
down
he
led
her
to
a
bench
in
the
middle
of
the
walk
that
runs
about
the
basin
i
something
else
he
brought
out
of
his
pocket
a
chocolate
tablet
and
what
besides
only
i
ashamed
it
not
in
its
wrapper
give
it
me
give
it
it
just
the
war
he
looked
on
as
she
nibbled
it
the
first
time
said
he
that
i
thought
the
war
had
any
good
in
it
oh
let
not
talk
of
it
it
is
so
completely
overwhelming
yes
he
said
enthusiastic
we
shall
never
speak
of
it
all
of
a
sudden
the
atmosphere
began
to
grow
lighter
look
at
those
pierrots
who
are
taking
their
tub
she
pointed
to
the
sparrows
that
were
attending
to
their
toilets
on
the
edge
of
the
basin
but
then
the
other
night
he
followed
her
thought
the
other
night
in
the
subway
tell
me
now
you
did
see
me
then
sure
but
you
never
looked
my
way
all
the
time
you
stayed
turned
in
the
other
direction
see
now
just
as
at
present
he
gazed
at
her
profile
as
she
nibbled
at
her
bun
looking
straight
ahead
of
her
with
roguish
eyes
do
look
at
me
a
moment
what
are
you
gazing
at
off
there
she
did
not
turn
her
head
he
took
her
right
hand
the
glove
of
which
was
torn
at
the
index
and
showed
the
end
of
the
finger
what
are
you
looking
at
and
you
examining
my
glove
will
you
be
so
kind
as
not
to
tear
it
more
in
a
distracted
fashion
he
was
engaged
in
making
the
hole
larger
oh
forgive
me
but
how
were
you
able
to
see
she
did
not
answer
but
in
that
mocking
profile
he
could
see
the
corner
of
her
eye
and
that
was
laughing
oh
you
slyboots
it
very
simple
everybody
can
do
that
i
never
could
just
try
you
simply
squint
i
never
could
never
in
order
to
see
it
necessary
for
me
to
look
right
to
the
front
stupidly
oh
no
not
so
stupidly
at
last
i
see
your
eyes
they
looked
at
each
other
gently
laughing
what
your
name
luce
that
a
lovely
name
lovely
as
this
day
and
yours
pierre
rather
worn
out
a
fine
name
that
has
honest
and
clear
eyes
like
mine
well
yes
so
far
as
clear
goes
they
are
that
because
they
looking
at
luce
luce
people
say
no
no
he
shook
his
head
you
are
not
you
are
just
luce
and
i
am
pierre
they
were
holding
hands
and
without
looking
at
one
another
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
tender
blue
of
the
sky
between
the
branches
of
the
leafless
trees
they
kept
silence
the
flood
of
their
thoughts
intermingled
by
way
of
their
hands
she
said
the
other
night
both
of
us
were
afraid
yes
said
he
how
good
it
was
only
later
they
smiled
at
having
expressed
each
one
what
the
other
was
dreaming
of
she
tore
her
hand
away
and
suddenly
sprang
up
having
heard
the
clock
strike
oh
i
have
scarcely
more
than
time
left
together
they
marched
at
that
little
the
parisian
women
take
so
prettily
so
that
seeing
them
trot
one
scarcely
thinks
of
their
swiftness
so
easy
appears
the
gait
do
you
pass
here
often
every
day
but
oftener
on
the
other
side
of
the
terrace
she
pointed
to
the
garden
with
its
watteau
trees
i
am
just
back
from
the
museum
he
looked
at
the
portfolio
she
carried
painter
he
asked
no
she
replied
that
too
big
a
word
a
little
dauberette
why
for
your
own
pleasure
oh
no
indeed
for
money
for
money
it
horrid
is
it
to
make
art
for
money
it
particularly
astonishing
to
make
money
if
one
can
not
paint
it
just
for
that
reason
you
see
i
explain
it
to
you
another
time
another
time
by
the
fountain
we
have
lunch
again
we
shall
see
if
it
good
weather
but
you
will
come
earlier
will
you
not
say
yes
luce
they
were
come
to
the
station
she
jumped
on
the
running
board
of
the
tram
car
answer
say
yes
little
light
she
did
not
answer
but
when
the
tram
was
in
motion
she
made
a
yes
with
her
eyelids
and
he
read
on
her
lips
without
her
having
spoken
yes
pierre
both
of
them
thought
as
they
went
their
way
it
amazing
this
evening
what
a
happy
look
everybody
has
and
they
kept
smiling
without
taking
heed
of
what
had
occurred
they
knew
only
that
they
had
that
they
possessed
and
that
to
them
it
what
nothing
we
feel
rich
this
evening
on
getting
home
they
looked
at
themselves
carefully
in
the
mirror
just
as
one
looks
at
a
friend
with
loving
eyes
they
said
to
themselves
that
gaze
of
his
of
hers
was
fixed
on
they
went
to
bed
early
overcome
but
wherefore
by
a
delicious
weariness
while
they
undressed
they
kept
thinking
what
best
of
all
at
present
is
that
there
a
tomorrow
tomorrow
those
who
come
after
us
will
have
some
difficulty
in
understanding
what
silent
despair
and
weariness
of
spirit
without
grounds
that
word
evoked
during
the
fourth
year
of
the
war
oh
such
a
weariness
so
many
times
had
hopes
been
destroyed
hundreds
of
tomorrows
just
like
yesterday
and
today
followed
on
each
similarly
devoted
to
emptiness
and
waiting
to
waiting
for
emptiness
time
no
longer
ran
the
year
was
like
a
river
styx
which
encircles
life
with
the
circuit
of
its
black
and
greasy
waters
with
its
somber
watery
silky
flood
that
seems
no
longer
to
move
tomorrow
tomorrow
is
dead
in
the
hearts
of
these
children
tomorrow
was
resuscitated
from
the
grave
tomorrow
saw
them
seated
again
near
the
fountain
and
tomorrows
followed
one
another
the
fine
weather
favored
these
very
brief
meetings
every
day
a
little
less
brief
each
one
brought
a
lunch
in
order
to
have
the
pleasure
of
exchanging
pierre
now
waited
at
the
door
of
the
museum
he
wanted
to
see
her
art
works
although
she
was
not
proud
of
them
she
did
not
make
him
beg
at
all
before
showing
them
they
were
reproductions
of
famous
paintings
in
miniature
or
portions
of
paintings
a
group
a
figure
a
bust
not
too
disagreeable
at
the
first
glance
but
extremely
loose
in
drawing
here
and
there
quite
true
and
pretty
touches
but
right
alongside
the
mistakes
of
a
pupil
exhibiting
not
merely
the
most
elementary
ignorance
but
a
reckless
ease
perfectly
careless
of
what
anyone
might
enough
good
enough
the
way
they
are
luce
recited
the
names
of
the
pictures
copied
pierre
knew
them
too
well
his
face
was
quite
drawn
from
his
discomfiture
luce
felt
that
he
was
not
pleased
but
she
summoned
all
her
courage
to
show
him
everything
and
this
one
too
woof
it
was
the
ugliest
one
she
had
she
kept
up
her
mocking
smile
which
was
directed
to
her
own
address
as
well
as
to
pierre
but
she
would
not
confess
to
herself
a
pinch
of
vexation
pierre
hardened
his
lips
in
order
not
to
speak
but
at
last
it
was
too
much
for
him
she
showed
him
a
copy
of
a
florentine
raphael
but
these
are
not
its
colors
said
he
oh
well
that
would
be
surprising
said
she
i
did
go
and
look
at
it
i
took
a
photo
and
did
anybody
object
who
my
clients
they
have
been
to
look
at
it
either
and
besides
even
if
they
had
seen
it
they
do
look
so
narrowly
the
red
the
green
the
blue
they
only
see
the
fire
in
it
sometimes
i
copy
the
original
in
colors
but
i
change
the
colors
see
here
for
instance
this
one
an
angel
by
murillo
do
you
find
it
better
no
but
it
amused
me
and
then
it
easier
and
besides
all
the
same
to
me
the
essential
thing
is
that
this
will
sell
at
this
last
piece
of
boasting
she
stopped
took
the
color
sketches
from
him
and
burst
out
laughing
ha
so
they
even
uglier
than
you
had
expected
he
said
greatly
annoyed
but
why
why
do
you
make
things
like
these
she
examined
his
upset
visage
with
a
kindly
smile
of
maternal
irony
this
dear
little
for
whom
everything
had
been
so
easy
and
who
could
not
conceive
that
one
must
make
concessions
for
he
asked
once
more
why
tell
me
why
he
was
quite
crestfallen
as
if
it
was
he
who
was
the
botcher
in
paint
dear
little
boy
she
would
have
liked
to
kiss
him
very
properly
on
his
forehead
she
answered
gently
why
in
order
to
live
he
was
quite
overcome
he
had
never
dreamed
of
it
life
is
complicated
she
went
on
in
a
light
and
mocking
tone
in
the
first
place
it
is
necessary
to
eat
and
then
to
eat
every
day
in
the
evening
one
has
dined
it
necessary
to
begin
again
the
next
day
and
then
it
necessary
to
dress
oneself
dress
oneself
completely
body
head
hands
feet
that
so
far
as
clothing
is
concerned
and
then
pay
for
it
all
for
everything
life
it
just
paying
for
the
first
time
he
saw
what
had
escaped
the
shortsightedness
of
his
love
the
modest
fur
in
some
places
worn
the
shoes
somewhat
the
worse
for
wear
the
traces
of
embarrassed
means
which
the
natural
elegance
of
a
little
parisian
woman
makes
one
forget
and
his
heart
contracted
within
him
ah
could
i
be
allowed
could
i
be
permitted
to
help
you
she
moved
away
from
him
a
bit
and
reddened
no
no
she
returned
much
upset
there
no
question
of
that
never
i
have
no
need
but
it
would
make
me
so
happy
no
nothing
more
to
be
said
about
that
or
we
shall
not
be
friends
any
more
we
are
friends
then
yes
that
to
say
if
you
are
so
still
after
you
have
seen
these
horrible
daubs
surely
surely
it
is
your
fault
but
do
they
trouble
you
oh
yes
she
laughed
out
contentedly
that
makes
you
laugh
naughty
girl
no
it
not
being
naughty
you
do
not
understand
then
why
do
you
laugh
i
sha
tell
you
she
was
thinking
love
how
kind
you
are
to
be
troubled
because
i
have
done
something
that
is
ugly
she
went
on
you
are
so
kind
thank
you
he
looked
at
her
with
astonished
eyes
do
try
to
understand
said
she
tapping
him
softly
on
his
hand
there
let
talk
of
something
else
yes
but
one
word
more
still
i
could
wish
to
know
tell
me
and
do
be
hurt
are
you
at
the
present
moment
a
bit
strapped
no
no
i
told
you
that
just
now
because
there
have
been
now
and
then
hard
times
but
now
it
goes
much
better
mama
has
found
a
situation
where
she
is
well
paid
your
mother
is
at
work
yes
in
a
munitions
factory
she
gets
twelve
francs
a
day
it
a
fortune
in
a
factory
a
war
factory
yes
why
it
frightful
oh
well
one
takes
what
offers
luce
but
if
you
you
should
have
such
an
offer
oh
me
you
see
yourself
i
just
daub
ah
you
perceive
now
that
i
have
good
reason
to
make
my
smears
but
if
it
were
necessary
to
have
money
and
there
were
no
other
way
than
to
work
in
one
of
those
factories
that
produce
would
you
go
if
it
were
necessary
to
make
money
and
no
other
means
why
surely
i
would
run
for
it
luce
do
you
realize
what
it
is
they
doing
in
there
no
i
do
think
about
it
everything
that
will
make
people
suffer
die
that
tears
them
to
pieces
that
burns
that
tortures
beings
like
you
like
me
she
put
her
hand
on
her
mouth
to
signal
to
him
to
hush
i
know
i
know
all
that
but
i
do
want
to
think
of
it
you
do
want
to
think
about
it
no
said
she
and
a
moment
after
one
must
live
if
one
thinks
about
it
one
can
not
live
any
more
for
myself
i
want
to
live
i
want
to
live
if
they
compel
me
to
do
that
in
order
to
live
shall
i
torment
myself
on
this
account
or
on
that
no
business
of
mine
it
is
i
that
wants
it
if
it
is
wrong
it
is
not
my
fault
not
my
own
as
for
me
what
i
want
is
nothing
bad
and
what
is
it
you
do
want
first
of
all
i
want
to
live
you
love
life
why
of
course
am
i
wrong
in
that
oh
no
it
is
so
jolly
that
you
do
live
and
you
you
do
love
it
also
i
did
not
up
to
the
time
up
to
the
time
this
question
did
not
call
for
an
answer
both
of
them
knew
it
following
up
his
thought
pierre
you
just
said
of
all
want
to
live
first
of
all
and
what
then
what
else
do
you
wish
i
do
know
yes
you
do
know
you
are
very
indiscreet
yes
very
it
embarrasses
me
to
tell
you
tell
me
in
my
ear
no
one
will
overhear
she
smiled
i
would
like
she
hesitated
i
would
like
just
a
of
happiness
they
were
quite
close
the
one
to
the
other
she
went
on
is
that
too
much
to
ask
they
have
often
told
me
that
i
an
egotist
and
as
for
me
i
sometimes
say
to
myself
what
has
one
a
right
to
when
one
sees
so
many
wretchednesses
so
much
pain
about
one
you
hardly
dare
to
ask
but
in
spite
of
all
my
heart
does
insist
and
cries
out
yes
i
have
the
right
i
have
the
right
to
a
very
little
portion
of
happiness
tell
me
very
frankly
is
that
being
an
egotist
do
you
think
that
wrong
he
was
overcome
by
an
infinite
pity
that
cry
of
the
heart
that
poor
little
naïve
cry
stirred
him
down
to
his
soul
tears
came
to
his
eyes
side
by
side
on
the
bench
leaning
one
against
the
other
they
felt
the
warmth
of
their
legs
he
would
have
liked
to
turn
toward
her
and
take
her
in
his
arms
he
did
not
dare
move
for
fear
of
not
remaining
in
control
of
his
emotion
immovable
they
looked
straight
forward
at
the
ground
before
their
feet
very
swiftly
in
a
low
ardent
voice
almost
without
moving
his
lips
he
said
oh
my
darling
little
body
oh
my
heart
would
i
could
hold
your
little
feet
in
my
hands
upon
my
mouth
i
would
like
to
eat
you
all
without
budging
and
very
low
and
very
quickly
just
as
he
had
spoken
she
replied
full
of
trouble
crazy
foolish
boy
silence
i
beg
of
you
a
of
a
certain
age
limped
slowly
past
them
they
felt
their
two
bodies
melt
together
with
tenderness
nobody
left
on
the
walk
a
sparrow
with
ruffled
feathers
was
dusting
itself
in
the
sand
the
fountain
shed
its
lucent
droplets
timidly
their
faces
turned
one
toward
the
other
and
scarcely
had
their
eyes
met
each
other
when
like
the
rush
of
birds
their
mouths
met
frightened
and
closely
pressed
and
then
they
flew
apart
luce
sprang
up
departed
he
also
had
risen
she
said
to
him
stay
here
they
did
not
dare
to
look
at
one
another
any
longer
he
murmured
luce
that
little
bit
that
little
bit
of
happiness
say
now
we
have
it
the
weather
caused
an
interruption
to
the
lunches
by
the
fountain
of
the
sparrows
fogs
came
to
obscure
the
february
sun
but
they
could
not
snuff
out
the
one
they
carried
in
their
hearts
ah
all
the
bad
weather
you
could
wish
might
be
on
hand
cold
hot
rain
wind
snow
or
sun
everything
would
be
well
always
and
even
things
would
be
better
for
when
happiness
is
in
its
period
of
growth
the
very
finest
of
all
the
days
is
always
today
the
fog
offered
them
a
benevolent
pretext
not
to
separate
during
a
portion
of
the
day
less
risk
that
way
of
being
observed
in
the
morning
he
went
to
wait
for
her
at
the
arrival
of
the
train
and
he
accompanied
her
in
her
walks
about
paris
he
had
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
turned
up
she
wore
a
fur
toque
her
boa
rolled
in
a
chilly
way
up
to
her
chin
her
little
veil
tightly
tied
on
which
her
lips
pushed
out
and
made
in
it
a
small
round
relief
but
the
best
veil
was
the
moist
network
of
the
protective
mist
the
mist
was
like
a
curtain
of
ashes
dense
grayish
with
phosphorescent
spots
one
could
not
see
farther
than
ten
yards
it
became
thicker
and
thicker
as
they
passed
down
the
old
streets
perpendicular
to
the
seine
friendly
fog
in
which
a
dream
stretches
itself
between
linen
and
shudders
with
delight
they
were
like
the
almond
in
the
shell
of
the
nut
like
a
flame
enclosed
in
a
dark
lantern
pierre
held
the
left
arm
of
luce
closely
pressed
to
him
they
walked
with
the
same
step
almost
of
the
same
stature
she
a
trifle
taller
twittering
in
a
halfvoice
their
figures
quite
close
together
he
would
have
liked
to
kiss
the
little
moist
round
on
her
veil
she
was
going
to
the
shopman
who
sold
false
antiques
who
had
ordered
them
to
dispose
of
her
turnips
her
little
beets
as
she
called
them
they
were
never
in
a
great
hurry
to
reach
the
place
and
without
doing
so
on
purpose
at
least
that
is
what
they
insisted
took
the
longest
way
about
putting
their
mistake
to
the
debit
of
the
fog
when
at
last
nevertheless
the
place
came
to
meet
them
despite
all
the
efforts
made
to
get
it
off
the
track
pierre
stayed
at
a
distance
she
entered
the
shop
he
waited
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
waited
a
long
time
and
he
was
not
very
warm
but
he
was
glad
to
wait
and
not
to
be
warm
and
even
to
be
bored
because
it
was
all
for
her
at
last
she
came
out
again
and
quick
quick
she
skipped
up
to
him
smiling
tender
in
great
disquiet
lest
he
be
frozen
he
saw
in
her
eyes
when
she
had
succeeded
and
then
he
rejoiced
over
it
as
if
it
were
he
who
had
made
the
money
but
most
often
she
came
back
to
him
empty
handed
it
was
necessary
to
return
to
the
shop
two
or
three
days
in
succession
in
order
to
obtain
her
pay
very
happy
she
if
they
did
not
give
her
back
the
object
ordered
accompanied
by
rebukes
today
for
instance
they
had
made
a
great
fuss
on
account
of
a
miniature
painted
from
the
photograph
of
an
honest
fellow
deceased
whom
she
had
never
seen
the
family
was
indignant
because
she
had
not
given
him
the
exact
colors
of
his
eyes
and
hair
it
was
necessary
to
do
it
all
over
again
since
she
was
disposed
rather
to
look
at
the
comic
side
of
her
misadventures
she
laughed
courageously
about
it
but
pierre
did
not
laugh
he
was
furious
idiots
triple
idiots
when
luce
showed
him
the
photographs
which
she
had
to
copy
in
colors
he
thundered
in
his
disdain
oh
how
amused
she
was
at
his
comical
fury
at
these
heads
of
imbeciles
frozen
in
solemn
smiles
that
the
dear
eyes
of
his
luce
should
have
to
apply
themselves
to
reproducing
and
her
hands
to
tracing
the
pictures
of
these
mugs
seemed
to
him
a
profanation
no
it
was
too
revolting
copies
from
the
museums
were
more
worth
while
but
one
could
not
count
on
them
any
more
the
last
museums
had
shut
their
doors
and
no
longer
interested
her
clients
it
was
no
longer
the
hour
for
virgin
maries
and
angels
only
for
the
every
family
had
its
own
dead
or
alive
oftener
dead
and
wanted
to
eternalize
his
features
the
wealthier
ones
wanted
colors
work
paid
for
well
enough
but
beginning
to
be
scarce
it
was
needful
for
her
not
to
be
capricious
lacking
which
all
that
remained
for
the
time
being
was
the
enlarging
of
photographs
at
laughable
prices
the
clearest
point
in
all
of
this
was
that
she
no
longer
had
any
reason
to
spend
her
time
in
paris
no
more
copies
in
the
museum
all
that
was
needed
being
to
go
to
the
shop
to
collect
and
bring
back
the
orders
every
two
or
three
days
the
work
itself
could
be
done
at
home
that
was
not
exactly
what
the
two
children
liked
they
continued
to
stroll
about
the
streets
unable
to
decide
on
taking
up
the
way
to
the
station
since
they
felt
weary
and
the
icy
fog
pierced
them
through
they
went
into
a
church
and
there
seated
most
properly
in
the
corner
of
a
chapel
they
talked
in
low
voices
about
the
little
affairs
of
their
life
while
they
looked
at
the
windows
from
time
to
time
there
fell
a
silence
and
their
souls
delivered
from
mere
words
it
was
not
the
meaning
in
the
words
that
interested
them
but
their
breath
of
life
like
the
furtive
contacts
between
quivering
antennae
their
souls
pursued
another
dialogue
more
solemn
and
profound
the
dreams
in
the
colored
windows
the
shadows
cast
by
the
piers
the
droning
of
the
hymns
mingled
with
their
dream
evoked
the
sorrowful
facts
of
life
which
they
desired
to
forget
and
the
consoling
homesickness
of
the
infinite
although
it
was
nearly
eleven
a
yellowish
twilight
brimmed
the
nave
like
the
oil
of
a
sacred
cruet
from
on
high
and
from
a
great
distance
came
strange
gleams
the
sombre
purple
of
a
window
a
red
pool
on
violet
ones
indistinct
figures
encircled
by
their
black
settings
against
the
high
wall
of
night
the
gleam
of
light
made
a
wound
abruptly
luce
remarked
shall
you
have
to
be
he
understood
at
once
what
she
meant
for
in
the
silence
his
spirit
too
had
pursued
the
same
obscure
trail
yes
he
said
we
must
talk
of
it
only
one
thing
tell
me
when
he
told
her
in
six
months
she
sighed
he
said
we
must
think
of
it
any
more
what
use
would
it
be
she
said
yes
what
use
they
drew
long
breaths
in
order
to
push
back
the
thought
then
courageously
or
should
one
say
to
the
contrary
timorously
let
him
who
knows
decide
where
true
courage
lies
they
both
compelled
themselves
to
talk
of
something
else
of
the
stars
of
the
candles
trembling
in
a
reek
of
the
organ
playing
a
prelude
of
the
beadle
who
was
passing
of
the
box
full
of
surprises
which
her
handbag
was
in
which
the
indiscreet
fingers
of
pierre
were
rummaging
they
had
a
very
passion
of
amusing
themselves
with
nothings
neither
one
nor
the
other
of
these
poor
little
creatures
so
much
as
considered
the
shadow
of
an
idea
of
escaping
from
that
destiny
which
must
separate
them
to
make
any
resistance
against
the
war
to
brave
the
current
of
a
nation
as
well
to
lift
up
the
church
which
covered
them
with
its
shell
the
only
recourse
was
to
forget
to
forget
up
to
the
last
second
while
hoping
at
bottom
that
this
last
second
would
never
arrive
until
then
to
be
happy
after
they
went
out
while
chatting
she
pulled
him
by
the
arm
in
order
to
cast
a
glance
at
a
shopfront
which
they
had
just
passed
a
shoe
shop
he
found
his
gaze
caressing
tenderly
a
pair
of
fine
leather
shoes
tall
and
laced
up
pretty
eh
said
he
she
said
a
love
he
laughed
at
the
expression
and
she
laughed
also
would
they
be
too
big
no
just
a
fit
well
then
suppose
one
bought
them
she
pressed
his
arm
and
pulled
him
on
so
as
to
tear
him
away
from
the
sight
one
has
to
belong
to
the
wealthy
humming
the
air
of
la
but
they
not
for
us
why
not
cinderella
put
the
slipper
on
all
right
at
that
time
there
were
fairies
still
in
the
present
time
there
are
lovers
still
she
sang
non
nenni
mon
petit
ami
why
so
since
we
are
friends
just
for
that
reason
for
that
yes
because
one
can
not
accept
things
from
a
friend
then
perhaps
from
an
enemy
rather
from
a
stranger
my
shopman
for
instance
if
he
wanted
to
advance
me
a
payment
the
robber
but
luce
i
certainly
have
the
right
to
order
from
you
a
painting
if
i
wish
she
stopped
to
burst
out
laughing
you
a
painting
by
me
my
poor
friend
what
could
you
do
with
it
you
have
gained
a
good
deal
of
merit
already
just
for
having
looked
at
them
i
know
well
enough
that
they
are
they
would
stick
in
your
throat
not
at
all
some
of
them
are
very
cunning
and
besides
if
they
suit
my
taste
it
certainly
changed
since
yesterday
is
it
allowable
to
change
one
taste
no
not
when
one
a
friend
luce
do
my
portrait
well
well
now
his
portrait
why
it
very
serious
i
as
good
as
those
idiots
she
squeezed
his
arm
in
an
unthinking
burst
darling
what
was
that
you
said
i
did
say
anything
i
heard
you
all
right
well
then
keep
it
for
yourself
no
i
sha
keep
it
i
give
it
back
to
you
double
darling
darling
you
do
my
portrait
wo
you
it
settled
have
you
a
photo
no
i
have
not
then
what
do
you
expect
i
ca
paint
you
in
the
street
i
suppose
you
told
me
that
at
home
you
were
alone
almost
every
day
yes
the
days
mama
works
at
the
factory
but
i
do
dare
you
are
afraid
then
that
we
shall
be
seen
no
that
not
the
reason
we
have
no
neighbors
well
then
what
is
it
you
afraid
of
she
did
not
reply
they
were
come
to
the
square
before
the
tramway
station
although
all
about
them
were
people
who
were
waiting
they
were
hardly
to
be
seen
the
fog
continued
to
isolate
the
little
couple
she
evaded
his
eyes
he
took
her
two
hands
and
said
tenderly
my
darling
do
be
afraid
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
they
gazed
at
each
other
their
eyes
were
so
loyal
i
trust
you
said
she
she
closed
her
eyes
she
felt
that
she
was
sacred
to
him
they
let
go
hands
the
tram
was
about
to
start
pierre
gaze
questioned
luce
what
day
he
demanded
thursday
she
replied
come
about
two
at
the
moment
of
parting
she
regained
her
roguish
smile
she
whispered
in
his
ear
and
you
must
bring
your
photo
just
the
same
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
paint
without
the
photo
yes
yes
i
know
you
have
some
you
naughty
little
humbug
out
beyond
the
malakoff
streets
like
broken
teeth
separated
by
vague
regions
losing
themselves
in
a
dubious
kind
of
where
among
boarded
enclosures
blossom
the
cabins
of
ragpickers
the
gray
dull
sky
is
lying
low
over
the
colorless
ground
whose
thin
edges
smoke
with
the
fog
the
air
is
chill
the
house
easy
to
find
there
are
only
three
of
them
on
one
side
of
the
road
the
last
of
the
three
it
has
no
neighbor
across
the
street
it
has
but
one
story
with
a
little
courtyard
which
is
surrounded
by
a
picket
fence
two
or
three
starveling
trees
a
square
patch
of
kitchen
garden
under
the
snow
pierre
has
made
no
noise
on
entering
the
snow
deadens
his
steps
but
the
curtains
of
the
ground
floor
are
in
motion
and
when
he
reaches
the
door
the
door
opens
and
luce
is
on
the
threshold
in
the
half
light
of
the
hall
they
say
good
day
in
a
choking
voice
and
she
ushers
him
into
the
first
apartment
which
serves
as
there
it
is
that
she
works
her
easel
is
installed
near
the
window
at
first
they
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
one
another
both
have
thought
over
this
visit
altogether
too
much
beforehand
none
of
the
speeches
they
had
prepared
is
able
to
come
forth
and
they
talk
in
a
halfvoice
although
there
is
nobody
else
in
the
house
and
it
just
for
that
reason
they
stay
seated
at
some
distance
from
each
other
with
their
arms
rigid
and
he
has
not
even
thrown
back
the
collar
of
his
cloak
they
chat
about
the
cold
weather
and
the
hours
of
the
tramcars
they
are
unhappy
to
feel
themselves
so
silly
at
last
she
makes
an
effort
and
asks
if
he
has
brought
the
photographs
and
scarcely
has
he
taken
them
from
his
pocket
when
both
pluck
up
a
spirit
these
pictures
are
the
intermediaries
over
whose
heads
the
chat
revives
for
now
the
two
are
not
entirely
alone
there
are
eyes
that
look
at
you
and
they
are
not
embarrassing
pierre
has
had
the
clever
idea
there
was
really
no
roguishness
in
it
to
bring
all
his
photographs
from
the
age
of
three
there
was
one
that
showed
him
in
a
little
skirt
luce
laughed
with
pleasure
she
spoke
to
the
photo
in
comical
baby
talk
can
there
be
anything
more
delightful
to
a
woman
than
to
see
the
picture
of
the
person
she
loves
when
he
was
quite
small
she
cradles
she
rocks
him
in
her
thoughts
she
gives
him
the
breast
and
she
is
even
not
so
far
from
the
dream
that
she
has
given
him
birth
and
besides
nor
does
she
dupe
herself
at
all
it
forms
a
convenient
pretext
to
say
to
the
infant
what
she
can
not
force
herself
to
say
to
the
when
he
asks
which
one
of
the
photographs
she
prefers
she
says
without
hesitating
the
dear
little
codger
how
serious
he
looks
already
almost
more
serious
than
today
certainly
if
luce
dared
to
look
and
just
here
she
does
dare
in
order
to
make
comparisons
with
the
pierre
of
today
she
would
see
in
his
eyes
an
expression
of
joy
and
infantile
gayety
that
does
not
appear
in
the
infant
for
the
eyes
of
this
infant
this
little
under
a
bell
glass
are
birds
in
a
cage
that
lack
sunlight
and
the
sunlight
has
come
has
it
luce
in
his
turn
he
asks
to
see
photos
of
luce
she
exhibits
a
little
girl
of
six
with
a
big
plait
who
is
squeezing
a
little
dog
in
her
arms
and
as
she
sees
it
again
she
thinks
mischievously
that
in
that
period
she
loved
no
less
fervently
nor
very
differently
whatever
heart
she
possessed
she
gave
it
even
then
to
her
dog
it
was
pierre
already
while
waiting
till
he
arrived
also
she
showed
a
young
miss
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
who
twisted
her
neck
with
a
coquettish
and
a
somewhat
pretentious
air
luckily
there
was
always
there
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
that
roguish
little
smile
which
appeared
to
say
you
know
i
just
amusing
myself
i
do
taken
myself
seriously
now
they
had
completely
forgotten
their
former
embarrassment
she
set
herself
to
the
portrait
since
he
must
not
budge
one
bit
any
more
nor
talk
except
with
the
tips
of
his
lips
she
it
was
who
made
almost
all
the
conversation
all
by
herself
instinct
told
her
that
silence
was
dangerous
and
as
it
happens
with
sincere
persons
who
talk
at
some
length
she
came
quickly
to
the
point
of
confiding
to
him
the
intimate
affairs
of
her
life
and
those
of
her
family
which
she
did
not
have
the
slightest
intention
of
recounting
she
heard
herself
speak
with
astonishment
but
there
was
no
way
of
returning
to
solid
ground
the
very
silence
of
pierre
was
like
a
declivity
down
which
the
stream
glided
she
recited
the
facts
of
her
infant
life
in
the
provinces
she
came
from
touraine
her
mother
belonging
to
a
family
of
the
solid
became
infatuated
with
a
tutor
the
son
of
a
farmer
the
family
opposed
the
marriage
but
the
two
lovers
were
obstinate
the
young
girl
had
waited
until
she
was
of
age
in
order
to
send
out
the
legal
summons
to
her
family
after
the
marriage
her
people
would
not
recognize
her
the
young
couple
lived
through
years
of
affection
and
hard
fare
the
husband
wore
himself
out
at
his
task
and
sickness
arrived
the
wife
accepted
this
further
burden
courageously
she
worked
for
two
her
parents
obstinately
cherishing
their
wounded
pride
refused
to
do
anything
to
come
to
his
assistance
the
sick
man
died
a
few
months
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
and
the
two
women
did
not
try
to
renew
connection
with
the
mother
family
the
latter
would
have
welcomed
the
young
girl
if
she
had
made
any
advances
she
would
have
been
received
like
a
condoning
the
action
of
her
mother
but
the
family
might
wait
rather
eat
stones
for
breakfast
pierre
was
amazed
at
the
hard
heartedness
of
these
parents
luce
did
not
find
it
extraordinary
do
you
believe
there
are
a
great
many
people
like
that
not
wicked
no
i
am
sure
that
my
grandparents
are
not
and
even
believe
that
it
pained
them
not
to
say
to
us
back
but
their
had
been
mortified
too
much
and
among
these
people
nothing
else
that
is
so
great
it
is
stronger
than
all
the
rest
when
one
has
done
them
wrong
it
is
not
merely
the
wrong
that
one
has
done
them
there
is
the
others
are
wrong
and
they
themselves
are
right
and
so
without
being
cruel
no
really
they
are
not
they
would
let
you
die
near
them
at
a
slow
fire
rather
than
concede
that
perhaps
after
all
they
were
not
right
oh
they
are
not
the
only
ones
one
meets
with
many
others
say
am
i
mistaken
are
they
just
like
that
pierre
pondered
he
was
excited
for
he
was
thinking
why
yes
that
is
the
way
they
are
through
the
eyes
of
the
little
girl
he
saw
abruptly
the
penury
of
heart
the
aridity
of
this
class
of
which
he
formed
a
part
dry
and
wornout
earth
which
little
by
little
has
imbibed
all
the
juices
of
life
and
does
not
renew
them
any
more
just
like
those
lands
in
asia
where
the
fecundating
rivers
drop
by
drop
have
disappeared
under
the
vitreous
sand
even
those
whom
they
believe
they
love
are
loved
in
a
proprietary
way
they
sacrifice
them
to
their
egotism
to
their
buttressed
pride
to
their
narrow
and
headstrong
intelligence
pierre
took
a
sorrowful
review
of
his
parents
and
himself
he
was
silent
the
panes
of
the
apartment
vibrated
under
the
shock
of
a
distant
cannonade
and
pierre
who
was
thinking
of
those
who
were
dying
said
with
bitterness
and
that
too
is
their
work
yes
the
hoarse
barking
of
these
cannon
away
off
there
the
universal
war
the
grand
catastrophe
the
dryness
of
heart
and
the
inhumanity
of
that
braggart
and
limited
had
a
large
part
in
the
responsibility
for
all
that
and
now
which
was
only
just
the
unchained
monster
would
never
stop
until
it
had
devoured
them
and
luce
said
that
is
true
for
without
knowing
that
she
did
so
she
followed
the
thought
of
pierre
he
started
at
the
echo
yes
it
is
true
said
he
what
has
come
about
is
just
this
world
was
too
old
it
ought
to
it
must
die
and
luce
bowing
her
head
sorrowful
and
resigned
said
once
more
yes
solemn
faces
of
children
bent
beneath
destiny
whose
youthful
brows
touched
by
the
wing
of
care
bore
within
them
such
distressful
ponderings
darkness
increased
in
the
room
it
was
not
very
warm
in
there
her
hands
being
icy
luce
stopped
her
work
which
pierre
was
not
allowed
to
see
they
went
to
the
window
and
contemplated
the
evening
shadows
across
mournful
fields
and
wooded
hills
the
violet
forests
formed
a
half
circle
against
a
greenish
sky
powdered
with
dust
of
a
pale
gold
a
bit
of
the
soul
of
puvis
de
chavannes
floated
there
a
simple
phrase
of
luce
made
it
evident
that
she
understood
how
to
read
that
subtle
harmony
he
was
almost
astonished
she
was
not
miffed
at
that
and
said
that
one
might
easily
feel
a
thing
that
one
would
be
incapable
of
expressing
though
she
painted
very
badly
it
was
not
altogether
her
fault
through
an
economical
turn
perhaps
she
had
not
finished
her
course
at
the
arts
décoratifs
besides
poverty
alone
had
made
her
turn
to
painting
what
use
in
painting
without
a
purpose
and
did
not
pierre
think
that
almost
all
those
who
produce
art
do
it
without
actual
necessity
through
vanity
in
order
to
occupy
their
time
or
else
because
at
first
they
think
they
need
it
and
later
on
will
not
confess
they
were
mistaken
one
should
not
be
an
artist
save
when
one
absolutely
can
not
keep
to
oneself
the
feeling
one
has
only
when
one
has
too
much
feeling
but
luce
said
she
possessed
just
enough
for
one
she
went
on
no
for
two
because
he
made
a
face
at
her
the
lovely
golden
tints
in
the
sky
began
to
turn
to
brown
the
deserted
plain
put
on
a
disconsolate
mask
pierre
asked
luce
if
she
was
not
afraid
in
that
solitude
no
when
you
get
home
late
there
is
no
danger
the
apaches
do
come
here
they
have
their
own
customs
they
are
too
besides
we
have
over
there
an
old
ragpicker
and
his
dog
and
besides
i
have
no
fear
oh
i
not
boasting
about
myself
i
have
no
merit
at
all
in
it
i
am
not
courageous
naturally
only
i
have
not
as
yet
had
any
occasion
to
meet
with
real
fear
the
day
i
do
see
it
perhaps
i
shall
be
more
of
a
poltroon
than
the
next
one
does
one
ever
know
what
one
really
is
well
i
for
my
part
know
what
you
are
quoth
pierre
ah
that
is
much
easier
i
myself
likewise
i
know
as
to
you
one
always
knows
better
about
another
the
moist
chill
of
evening
entered
the
room
through
the
closed
windows
pierre
felt
a
little
shudder
luce
who
perceived
it
at
once
on
his
neck
ran
to
make
him
a
cup
of
chocolate
which
she
heated
on
her
they
took
a
bit
of
food
luce
had
thrown
her
shawl
maternally
over
pierre
shoulders
and
he
let
her
do
it
like
a
cat
enjoying
the
warmth
of
the
stuff
once
more
the
current
of
their
thoughts
brought
them
back
to
the
family
history
which
luce
had
interrupted
pierre
continued
both
of
you
all
alone
so
entirely
alone
you
and
your
mother
you
must
be
deeply
attached
to
one
another
yes
said
luce
we
were
very
much
attached
repeated
pierre
oh
said
luce
we
always
love
each
other
still
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
word
which
had
escaped
her
without
thinking
why
must
she
always
tell
him
more
than
she
meant
to
and
nevertheless
he
did
not
ask
he
dared
not
ask
her
but
she
saw
that
his
heart
was
putting
the
question
and
it
so
nice
to
confide
in
someone
when
one
has
never
had
the
chance
the
silence
of
the
house
the
of
the
room
encouraged
her
to
confess
she
observed
there
no
saying
or
knowing
what
has
been
going
on
for
the
last
four
years
the
whole
world
is
changed
you
mean
to
say
that
your
mother
or
that
you
have
changed
the
whole
world
repeated
she
in
what
respect
that
hard
to
define
one
feels
everywhere
among
people
who
know
each
other
even
in
the
family
that
the
relations
are
not
the
same
one
is
never
sure
of
anything
any
more
in
the
morning
one
says
to
oneself
what
is
it
i
am
going
to
experience
this
night
shall
i
recognize
it
one
is
as
if
on
a
plank
in
the
water
just
about
to
upset
what
is
it
that
happened
i
do
know
said
luce
i
ca
explain
it
but
it
has
come
since
the
war
there
is
something
in
the
air
everybody
is
troubled
in
families
one
sees
people
who
were
not
capable
of
doing
without
one
another
marching
off
today
each
one
in
his
own
direction
and
as
if
intoxicated
each
one
runs
along
with
nose
on
the
trail
where
do
they
go
i
do
know
and
i
believe
they
do
either
either
pure
chance
or
some
desire
spurs
them
women
take
lovers
men
forget
their
wives
and
kindly
people
too
who
generally
appear
so
calm
and
so
orderly
everywhere
we
hear
of
households
broken
up
it
the
same
between
parents
and
children
my
mother
she
stopped
then
ran
on
my
mother
lives
her
own
life
she
stopped
again
oh
it
perfectly
natural
she
is
still
young
and
poor
mama
has
not
had
much
happiness
she
has
not
poured
out
her
sum
of
affection
she
has
a
right
to
want
to
make
her
life
over
again
pierre
inquired
she
wants
to
marry
again
luce
shook
her
head
one
could
hardly
know
very
well
pierre
dared
not
insist
she
loves
me
well
still
but
it
not
the
way
it
used
to
be
she
is
able
to
do
without
me
at
present
poor
mama
she
would
be
so
sorry
if
she
knew
that
her
love
for
me
is
no
longer
in
her
heart
as
the
first
of
all
she
would
never
confess
that
never
o
how
queer
it
is
this
life
she
wore
a
sweet
smile
sorrowful
and
roguish
upon
her
hands
placed
on
the
table
pierre
put
his
hands
tenderly
and
sat
without
motion
we
are
poor
creatures
he
muttered
luce
continued
in
a
moment
we
two
how
tranquil
we
are
the
others
have
the
fever
the
war
the
factories
people
are
in
a
hurry
they
hustle
to
work
hard
to
live
to
enjoy
themselves
yes
said
pierre
the
time
is
short
all
the
more
reason
not
to
run
said
luce
one
gets
too
soon
to
the
end
let
us
walk
slowly
but
it
time
that
hurries
along
hold
on
to
it
well
i
holding
onto
it
i
holding
said
luce
grasping
his
hand
thus
back
and
forward
tenderly
gravely
they
talked
like
a
pair
of
good
old
friends
but
they
took
good
care
that
the
table
should
stay
between
them
and
behold
they
perceived
that
the
night
had
filled
the
room
pierre
rose
hurriedly
luce
did
nothing
to
retain
him
the
short
hour
had
passed
they
were
afraid
of
the
hour
that
might
come
they
said
to
each
other
with
the
same
constraint
the
same
low
and
choked
voice
as
when
he
came
in
on
the
threshold
their
hands
scarcely
dared
to
press
each
other
but
when
the
door
was
shut
just
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
garden
as
he
turned
his
head
toward
the
window
of
the
ground
floor
he
saw
in
the
last
gleam
of
the
twilight
on
the
pane
the
outline
of
luce
who
was
following
his
departure
into
the
uncertain
depths
of
the
obscurity
with
a
face
full
of
passion
and
turning
back
to
the
window
he
pressed
his
lips
against
the
closed
pane
their
lips
kissed
through
the
wall
of
glass
then
luce
moved
back
into
the
shadows
of
the
room
and
the
curtain
fell
for
the
past
fortnight
they
had
been
unaware
of
anything
that
was
going
on
in
the
world
in
paris
people
might
make
arrests
and
issue
condemnations
as
hard
as
they
could
germany
might
make
treaties
and
tear
up
those
she
had
signed
governments
might
lie
the
press
denounce
and
armies
kill
they
did
not
read
the
papers
they
knew
there
was
the
war
somewhere
all
about
them
just
as
there
is
typhus
or
else
influenza
but
that
did
not
touch
them
they
did
not
want
to
think
about
it
the
war
recalled
itself
to
them
that
night
they
had
already
gone
to
bed
they
spent
their
hearts
so
freely
in
those
days
that
when
evening
came
they
were
worn
out
they
heard
the
alarm
signals
each
in
his
or
her
respective
quarter
and
declined
to
get
up
they
hid
their
heads
in
their
beds
under
the
bedclothes
as
a
child
will
during
a
not
at
all
from
fear
they
were
positive
that
nothing
could
happen
to
them
but
in
order
to
dream
listening
to
the
air
rumbling
in
the
night
luce
thought
it
would
be
delightful
to
listen
to
the
storm
as
it
passes
in
his
arms
pierre
stopped
his
ears
let
nothing
trouble
his
thoughts
he
insisted
on
picking
out
on
the
piano
of
memory
the
song
of
the
day
passed
the
melodious
thread
of
the
hours
from
the
first
minute
that
he
entered
luce
house
the
slightest
inflections
of
her
voice
and
her
gestures
the
successive
images
which
his
eyes
had
hastily
snapped
up
a
shadow
under
the
eyelids
a
wave
of
emotion
that
passed
beneath
the
skin
like
a
shiver
across
the
water
a
smile
just
brushing
against
the
lips
like
a
sun
ray
and
his
palm
pressed
on
nestled
against
the
nude
softness
of
the
two
extended
hands
these
precious
fragments
that
endeavored
to
reunite
the
magic
fantasy
of
love
in
a
single
close
embrace
he
would
not
permit
that
noises
from
without
should
enter
there
the
outside
was
for
him
a
tiresome
visitor
the
war
oh
i
know
i
know
has
it
come
let
it
wait
and
the
war
did
wait
at
the
door
patiently
war
knew
that
it
would
have
its
turn
he
knew
that
also
that
is
why
he
had
no
shame
in
his
egotism
the
rising
billow
of
death
was
about
to
seize
him
so
he
owed
death
nothing
in
advance
nothing
let
death
come
back
again
at
the
date
of
the
contract
up
to
that
day
let
death
be
silent
ah
up
to
then
at
least
he
did
not
want
to
lose
anything
of
this
marvelous
time
each
second
was
a
golden
grain
and
he
the
miser
who
paws
over
his
treasure
it
mine
it
my
property
do
you
dare
touch
my
peace
my
love
it
my
own
up
to
the
hour
and
when
will
the
hour
come
perhaps
it
will
not
come
at
all
a
miracle
why
not
meantime
the
stream
of
hours
and
days
kept
on
flowing
at
each
new
bend
of
the
channel
the
roaring
of
the
rapids
drew
nearer
stretched
out
in
their
barque
pierre
and
luce
listened
and
heard
but
they
had
no
more
fear
even
that
enormous
voice
like
the
bass
notes
of
an
organ
cradled
their
amorous
dream
when
the
gulf
should
be
there
they
would
close
their
eyes
press
closer
together
and
all
would
be
over
in
one
blow
the
gulf
spared
them
the
trouble
of
thinking
about
the
life
that
was
to
be
that
might
possibly
be
afterward
about
the
future
without
an
issue
for
luce
foresaw
the
obstacles
that
pierre
would
have
to
encounter
if
he
wished
to
marry
her
and
pierre
less
clearly
he
had
less
taste
for
clearness
feared
them
also
let
us
not
look
so
far
ahead
life
beyond
the
gulf
was
like
that
other
life
they
talked
about
in
church
they
tell
you
that
we
shall
find
each
other
again
but
they
are
not
so
very
sure
one
sole
thing
is
sure
the
present
our
own
present
let
pour
into
it
without
any
taking
of
stock
the
whole
of
our
part
in
eternity
even
less
than
pierre
did
luce
inform
herself
about
the
news
the
war
did
not
interest
her
in
the
least
it
was
only
one
misery
more
amongst
all
the
various
miseries
which
form
the
web
and
woof
of
social
existence
those
who
can
be
astonished
about
it
are
those
only
who
stand
sheltered
from
naked
realities
and
the
little
girl
with
her
precocious
experience
who
understood
the
struggle
for
one
daily
bread
god
does
not
grant
it
for
nothing
revealed
to
her
friend
the
murderous
war
which
for
poor
folks
and
particularly
for
women
reigns
cunningly
deep
and
without
a
truce
below
the
lie
of
peace
she
did
not
talk
too
much
about
it
however
for
fear
of
depressing
him
on
seeing
the
excitement
into
which
her
accounts
threw
him
she
had
an
affectionate
feeling
of
her
own
superiority
like
most
women
she
did
not
entertain
with
regard
to
certain
ugly
facts
of
life
the
physical
and
moral
disgust
which
upset
the
young
fellow
there
was
nothing
of
the
rebel
in
her
in
still
worse
circumstances
she
would
have
been
able
to
accept
repugnant
tasks
without
repugnance
and
quit
them
quite
calm
and
natty
without
a
stain
today
she
could
not
do
that
any
more
for
since
she
had
come
to
know
pierre
her
love
had
caused
her
to
be
filled
with
the
tastes
and
distastes
of
her
friend
but
that
was
not
her
fundamental
nature
calm
and
smiling
by
reason
of
her
race
not
pessimistic
at
all
melancholy
and
the
grand
detached
airs
of
life
were
not
her
business
life
is
as
it
is
let
us
take
it
as
it
is
it
might
have
been
worse
the
hazards
of
an
existence
which
luce
had
always
known
to
be
precarious
on
the
for
expedients
and
particularly
since
the
war
had
taught
her
to
be
careless
of
the
morrow
add
to
this
that
every
preoccupation
concerning
the
beyond
was
a
stranger
to
this
free
little
french
girl
life
was
enough
for
her
luce
found
life
delightful
but
it
all
hangs
by
a
thread
and
it
takes
so
little
to
make
the
thread
break
that
really
it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
to
torment
oneself
about
what
may
turn
up
tomorrow
eyes
of
mine
drink
in
the
daylight
that
bathes
you
as
you
pass
as
to
what
may
come
after
o
my
heart
abandon
yourself
in
confidence
to
the
stream
and
since
anyhow
we
can
not
do
otherwise
and
now
that
we
love
each
other
is
it
just
delicious
luce
well
knew
that
it
could
not
be
for
long
but
neither
her
life
nor
she
herself
either
would
be
for
long
she
did
not
resemble
much
that
little
fellow
who
loved
her
and
whom
she
loved
tender
ardent
and
nervous
happy
and
miserable
who
always
enjoyed
and
suffered
to
excess
who
gave
himself
who
flew
into
a
rage
always
with
passion
and
who
was
dear
to
her
just
because
he
resembled
her
hardly
at
all
but
both
of
them
were
in
accord
as
to
a
mute
resolve
not
to
look
into
the
future
the
girl
through
the
carelessness
of
the
resigned
rivulet
that
sings
on
its
way
the
other
through
that
exalted
negation
which
plunges
into
the
gulf
of
the
present
and
never
desires
to
emerge
again
the
big
brother
had
come
back
again
on
furlough
for
a
few
days
during
the
first
evening
at
home
he
perceived
that
there
was
something
changed
in
the
family
atmosphere
what
he
could
not
tell
but
he
was
vexed
the
mind
possesses
antennae
which
perceive
at
a
distance
before
consciousness
is
able
to
touch
and
consider
the
object
and
the
finest
of
all
antennae
are
those
of
vanity
philip
agitated
themselves
searched
about
and
were
surprised
they
missed
something
did
he
not
have
his
circle
of
affection
which
rendered
unto
him
the
customary
homage
the
attentive
audience
to
which
in
miserly
fashion
he
doled
out
his
stories
his
parents
who
brooded
him
under
their
touched
admiration
the
young
brother
stop
there
it
was
he
exactly
he
who
was
missing
to
the
appeal
he
was
present
of
course
but
he
did
not
exert
himself
about
his
big
brother
he
did
not
beg
for
confidences
as
was
his
wont
which
the
other
used
to
take
pleasure
in
denying
pitiful
vanity
philip
who
on
former
occasions
affected
in
regard
of
the
ardent
questions
of
his
younger
brother
a
sort
of
protective
and
bantering
lackadaisicalness
was
hurt
that
he
did
not
put
them
this
time
it
was
he
who
tried
to
provoke
them
he
became
more
loquacious
and
he
looked
at
pierre
as
if
he
wished
him
to
feel
that
his
talk
was
meant
for
him
at
another
time
pierre
would
have
thrilled
with
joy
and
caught
on
the
fly
the
handkerchief
that
was
tossed
him
but
he
quietly
permitted
philip
to
pick
it
up
for
himself
if
he
had
any
desire
to
do
so
philip
feeling
piqued
tried
irony
instead
of
being
troubled
pierre
answered
with
composure
in
the
same
detached
tone
philip
wanted
to
discuss
became
agitated
harangued
after
a
few
minutes
he
found
that
he
was
haranguing
all
by
himself
pierre
looked
on
at
his
efforts
wearing
an
air
of
saying
go
ahead
my
dear
boy
if
that
is
any
pleasure
to
you
continue
listening
that
insolent
little
smile
their
rôles
were
reversed
philip
stopped
talking
much
mortified
and
observed
his
young
brother
more
attentively
who
however
did
not
occupy
himself
further
with
him
how
he
had
changed
the
parents
who
saw
him
every
day
had
not
noticed
anything
but
the
penetrating
and
moreover
jealous
eyes
of
philip
did
not
find
any
more
the
well
known
expression
after
several
months
of
absence
pierre
had
a
happy
languid
thoughtless
torpid
air
indifferent
as
to
persons
inattentive
to
what
is
about
them
floating
in
an
atmosphere
of
voluptuous
dream
like
a
young
girl
and
philip
felt
that
he
counted
for
nothing
in
the
little
brother
thoughts
since
he
was
no
less
expert
in
analyzing
himself
than
in
observing
others
he
was
quick
to
recover
consciousness
of
his
own
vexation
and
laugh
at
it
vanity
thrust
aside
he
interested
himself
in
pierre
and
searched
for
the
secret
of
his
metamorphosis
he
would
have
liked
well
to
have
solicited
his
confidence
but
that
was
a
business
to
which
he
was
not
habituated
and
besides
little
brother
did
not
seem
to
have
any
need
of
confiding
with
a
careless
and
chaffing
unconstraint
he
looked
on
while
philip
attempted
awkwardly
to
spread
the
net
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
smiling
his
thoughts
elsewhere
whistling
a
little
air
he
answered
vaguely
without
listening
carefully
to
what
he
was
being
asked
then
all
of
a
sudden
turned
off
to
his
own
regions
good
night
and
he
was
no
longer
there
one
caught
only
at
his
reflection
in
the
water
which
escaped
from
between
one
and
philip
like
a
lover
disdained
felt
all
his
value
now
and
experienced
the
attraction
of
the
mystery
in
this
heart
which
he
had
lost
the
key
to
the
enigma
came
to
him
by
pure
chance
as
he
was
coming
home
in
the
evening
by
boulevard
montparnasse
in
the
dark
he
passed
pierre
and
luce
he
was
afraid
they
might
have
noticed
him
but
they
cared
little
for
what
surrounded
them
closely
pressed
together
pierre
supporting
his
arm
on
the
arm
of
luce
and
holding
her
hand
with
fingers
interlaced
they
strolled
along
with
short
steps
immersed
in
the
hungry
and
gluttonous
tenderness
of
eros
and
psyche
as
they
lie
at
length
on
the
nuptial
couch
in
the
farnesina
the
close
embrace
of
their
gaze
fused
them
into
a
single
being
like
a
waxen
group
philip
leaning
against
a
tree
looked
upon
them
as
they
passed
stopped
went
on
and
disappeared
in
the
dark
and
his
heart
was
full
of
pity
for
the
two
children
he
thought
my
life
is
sacrificed
so
be
it
but
it
is
not
right
to
take
those
also
if
at
the
least
i
could
pay
for
their
happiness
the
next
morning
in
spite
of
his
polite
inattention
pierre
noticed
vaguely
in
actual
fact
not
at
once
but
after
some
reflection
the
affectionate
tone
of
his
brother
with
him
and
getting
half
awake
he
perceived
his
kind
eyes
which
he
had
not
noticed
before
philip
looked
at
him
with
such
clarity
that
pierre
had
an
impression
that
this
gaze
was
scrutinizing
him
and
awkwardly
he
hastened
at
once
to
push
the
shutter
over
his
secret
but
philip
smiled
rose
and
putting
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
proposed
that
they
should
take
a
turn
in
the
open
pierre
could
not
resist
the
new
confidence
which
was
tendered
him
and
together
they
proceeded
to
the
luxembourg
near
at
hand
the
big
brother
had
kept
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
younger
and
the
latter
felt
himself
proud
of
the
accord
his
tongue
was
loosed
they
talked
animatedly
of
intellectual
things
of
books
their
reflections
on
men
their
new
experiences
of
everything
except
the
subject
both
were
thinking
about
it
was
like
a
tacit
convention
they
were
happy
to
feel
themselves
intimate
with
a
secret
between
them
while
chatting
pierre
inquired
of
himself
does
he
know
but
how
could
he
know
philip
observed
him
as
he
chattered
along
and
kept
on
smiling
pierre
ended
by
stopping
short
in
the
midst
of
a
sentence
what
the
matter
with
you
nothing
i
just
looking
at
you
i
am
delighted
with
you
they
shook
hands
while
they
were
returning
philip
said
are
you
happy
without
speaking
pierre
nodded
with
his
head
yes
you
are
right
my
boy
a
great
beautiful
thing
is
happiness
take
my
portion
in
order
not
to
trouble
him
philip
during
his
furlough
avoided
making
any
allusion
to
the
near
incorporation
of
pierre
class
in
the
army
but
on
the
day
of
his
departure
he
could
not
prevent
himself
from
expressing
his
anxiety
at
seeing
his
young
brother
exposed
very
soon
to
the
trials
which
he
knew
only
too
well
scarcely
did
a
shadow
cross
the
brow
of
the
young
lover
he
drew
his
eyebrows
a
bit
together
blinked
with
his
eyes
as
if
to
drive
off
a
troublesome
vision
and
said
enough
later
on
lo
sa
we
know
it
only
too
well
said
philip
what
in
any
case
i
do
know
said
pierre
vexed
that
he
should
insist
is
that
when
i
am
down
there
i
for
my
part
shall
do
no
killing
without
contradicting
him
philip
smiled
sorrowfully
knowing
well
what
the
implacable
power
of
the
crowd
does
with
weak
souls
and
with
their
will
march
was
back
again
with
a
longer
day
and
the
first
songs
of
birds
but
along
with
the
days
increased
the
sinister
flames
of
the
war
the
air
was
feverish
with
waiting
for
springtime
and
waiting
for
the
cataclysm
one
heard
the
monstrous
rumbling
grow
in
intensity
the
arms
of
millions
of
enemies
clashing
together
heaped
up
for
the
past
months
against
the
dyke
of
the
trenches
and
all
ready
to
spill
over
like
a
tidal
bore
upon
the
ile
de
france
and
the
nave
of
la
cité
the
shadow
of
frightful
rumors
preceded
the
plague
a
fantastic
report
of
poisoned
gases
of
deadly
venom
scattered
through
the
air
which
was
about
so
it
was
said
to
descend
on
whole
provinces
and
destroy
everything
like
the
asphyxiating
overflow
from
pelée
mountain
finally
the
visits
of
bombing
gothas
coming
oftener
and
oftener
cleverly
kept
up
the
nervousness
of
paris
pierre
and
luce
continued
to
refuse
to
recognize
anything
about
them
but
the
slow
fever
which
they
breathed
in
whether
they
would
or
not
from
that
atmosphere
heavy
with
menace
kindled
the
desire
that
glowed
in
their
young
bodies
three
years
of
war
had
propagated
in
european
souls
a
freedom
of
morals
which
reached
even
the
most
honest
and
straight
and
of
the
two
children
neither
one
nor
the
other
had
any
religious
beliefs
but
they
were
protected
by
their
delicacy
of
heart
their
instinctive
modesty
only
in
secret
they
had
decided
to
give
themselves
completely
one
to
the
other
before
the
blind
cruelty
of
mankind
should
separate
them
they
had
not
spoken
of
this
they
said
it
to
themselves
that
evening
once
or
twice
during
the
week
luce
mother
was
kept
at
the
factory
by
her
night
work
on
these
nights
luce
in
order
not
to
stay
alone
in
that
desert
quarter
slept
in
paris
with
a
girl
friend
nobody
kept
watch
over
her
the
two
lovers
took
advantage
of
this
freedom
to
pass
a
portion
of
the
evening
together
and
sometimes
they
took
a
simple
dinner
in
a
little
restaurant
on
leaving
after
dinner
on
this
evening
they
heard
the
signal
sound
they
took
refuge
in
the
nearest
place
as
if
it
were
an
affair
of
a
rain
shower
and
for
some
time
amused
themselves
observing
their
chance
comrades
but
the
danger
seeming
distant
or
no
longer
there
although
nothing
had
occurred
to
announce
the
end
of
the
luce
and
pierre
who
did
not
want
to
get
home
too
late
went
on
their
way
chatting
gaily
they
followed
an
old
dark
and
narrow
street
near
saint
sulpice
they
had
just
passed
a
hackney
coach
standing
idle
both
horse
and
driver
asleep
near
the
gate
of
a
they
were
twenty
steps
away
and
on
the
other
sidewalk
when
everything
about
them
shuddered
a
red
blinding
flash
a
roll
of
thunder
a
rain
of
loosened
tiles
and
broken
windowpanes
near
the
buttress
of
a
house
which
made
a
sharp
projection
into
the
street
they
flattened
themselves
against
the
wall
and
their
bodies
interlaced
by
the
gleam
of
the
explosion
they
had
seen
their
own
eyes
full
of
love
and
dismay
and
when
the
darkness
fell
again
voice
was
saying
no
pierre
i
want
no
more
and
pierre
felt
upon
his
own
lips
the
lips
and
the
teeth
of
the
passionate
girl
they
remained
palpitating
in
the
darkness
of
the
street
some
paces
away
some
men
issuing
from
the
houses
picked
the
dying
coachman
from
among
the
remnants
of
the
smashed
vehicle
they
passed
quite
close
to
them
with
the
unfortunate
man
whose
blood
was
falling
drop
by
drop
luce
and
pierre
remained
petrified
so
closely
knit
together
that
when
consciousness
revived
in
them
it
seemed
as
if
their
bodies
had
been
naked
in
the
pressure
they
loosened
their
hands
and
lips
grown
together
which
drank
of
the
loved
one
like
roots
and
both
of
them
they
began
to
tremble
let
us
go
home
said
luce
invaded
by
a
sacred
terror
she
dragged
him
away
luce
you
will
not
let
me
leave
this
life
before
oh
god
said
luce
squeezing
his
arm
that
thought
would
be
worse
than
death
my
love
my
love
they
kept
repeating
one
to
the
other
once
more
they
came
to
a
stop
when
shall
i
be
yours
said
pierre
he
could
not
have
dared
to
ask
when
shall
you
be
mine
luce
noticed
this
and
was
touched
by
it
adored
one
she
said
to
him
very
soon
let
not
hurry
you
can
not
desire
it
more
than
i
wish
it
let
us
stay
this
way
a
little
while
it
is
splendid
this
month
longer
right
to
the
end
until
easter
he
murmured
this
year
easter
was
the
last
day
in
march
yes
at
the
resurrection
ah
quoth
he
there
the
death
before
resurrection
hush
she
interposed
closing
his
mouth
with
her
own
they
drew
away
from
each
other
this
night
it
our
betrothal
whispered
pierre
huddled
against
each
other
while
they
walked
in
the
shadows
they
wept
gently
with
tenderness
the
ground
crackled
underfoot
with
the
broken
glass
and
the
sidewalk
was
bloody
death
and
the
night
were
lying
in
ambush
round
about
their
love
but
above
their
heads
like
a
magic
circle
beyond
the
embrasure
of
the
two
black
walls
in
the
narrow
street
as
through
a
chimney
the
heart
of
a
star
throbbed
against
the
deep
pulpy
grain
of
the
sky
lo
and
behold
the
voices
of
the
bells
sing
out
lights
are
rekindled
and
the
streets
are
animate
once
more
the
air
is
free
of
foes
paris
breathes
again
death
has
flown
they
had
come
to
the
day
preceding
palm
sunday
every
day
they
saw
each
other
for
hours
together
and
they
did
not
even
try
to
hide
themselves
any
more
they
no
longer
had
any
accounts
to
render
the
world
by
such
gossamer
threads
were
they
attached
to
it
and
so
near
to
breaking
two
days
before
the
german
grand
offensive
had
been
started
the
wave
advanced
along
a
front
of
nearly
a
hundred
kilometers
fast
following
emotions
caused
the
city
to
vibrate
the
explosion
of
courneuve
which
had
shaken
paris
like
an
earthquake
the
incessant
alarms
which
broke
in
on
sleep
and
wore
out
nerves
and
on
this
morning
of
saturday
after
a
troubled
night
all
those
who
were
not
able
to
close
an
eyelid
until
very
late
were
roused
again
by
the
thunder
of
the
mysterious
cannon
buried
in
the
far
distance
which
beyond
the
somme
launched
death
in
trial
shots
as
if
from
another
planet
in
the
course
of
the
earlier
shots
which
were
attributed
to
the
coming
back
of
the
aerial
gothas
people
had
taken
refuge
in
a
docile
way
inside
their
cellars
but
a
danger
that
continues
becomes
in
time
a
habit
to
which
life
accommodates
itself
and
the
peril
is
not
far
from
turning
out
an
attraction
even
when
the
risks
run
are
common
to
all
and
are
not
too
great
besides
the
weather
was
too
lovely
it
was
a
pity
to
bury
self
alive
before
noon
all
the
world
was
out
of
doors
and
the
streets
and
gardens
the
terraces
of
the
cafés
had
a
festival
air
on
this
radiant
and
burning
afternoon
it
was
this
afternoon
pierre
and
luce
had
selected
to
pass
far
from
the
crowd
in
the
forest
of
chaville
for
the
past
ten
days
they
had
existed
in
an
uplifted
calm
profound
peace
at
the
heart
and
nerves
on
edge
they
had
a
feeling
like
existing
on
an
islet
about
which
rushed
a
frantic
current
a
vertigo
of
sight
and
hearing
carried
them
away
but
with
eyelids
lowered
and
hands
on
ears
when
the
bolt
is
pushed
on
the
door
suddenly
in
one
inner
deep
there
comes
a
silence
a
blinding
silence
the
moveless
summer
day
when
joy
invisible
like
a
hidden
bird
sings
its
song
fresh
and
liquid
like
a
brook
o
joy
magical
singer
warblings
of
happiness
i
know
too
well
it
suffices
that
a
slit
should
open
between
my
lids
or
that
my
finger
should
cease
to
push
a
moment
against
my
ear
and
the
foam
and
roar
of
the
stream
will
follow
in
frail
dyke
just
to
know
it
so
frail
exalts
the
mood
of
joy
which
i
know
is
threatened
peace
and
silence
itself
take
on
a
passionate
look
the
woods
once
reached
they
held
each
other
by
the
hand
the
first
days
of
spring
are
a
new
wine
that
rises
to
the
head
the
youthful
sun
intoxicates
with
the
purest
juice
of
its
vine
light
still
floats
over
the
leafless
wood
and
athwart
the
bare
branches
the
blue
eye
of
the
sky
fascinates
the
reason
and
lulls
it
to
sleep
scarcely
did
they
endeavor
to
exchange
a
few
words
their
tongues
declined
to
finish
a
phrase
once
started
their
legs
were
weak
and
they
hated
to
walk
under
the
sunshine
and
the
silence
of
the
woods
they
tottered
the
earth
drew
them
just
to
lie
down
in
the
path
just
to
let
themselves
be
carried
along
on
the
rim
of
the
colossal
wheel
of
the
worlds
they
scrambled
over
the
bank
of
the
entered
a
thicket
and
side
by
side
on
the
old
dead
leaves
through
which
violets
showed
their
buds
they
stretched
themselves
out
the
first
songs
of
the
birds
and
the
distant
thuds
of
the
guns
mingled
with
the
village
bells
that
were
proclaiming
the
festival
of
the
morrow
the
luminous
air
vibrated
hope
faith
love
death
notwithstanding
the
solitude
they
spoke
in
whispers
their
hearts
were
oppressed
by
happiness
or
by
sorrow
they
could
not
have
told
they
were
submerged
in
their
dream
lucile
immobile
stretched
out
her
arms
close
to
her
body
her
eyes
open
absorbed
and
gazing
at
the
sky
felt
rising
in
her
a
hidden
suffering
which
since
the
morning
she
forced
herself
to
drive
away
in
order
not
to
mar
the
joy
of
the
holiday
pierre
laid
his
head
on
luce
knees
in
the
hollow
of
her
skirt
like
a
child
who
goes
to
sleep
with
its
face
close
couched
against
the
warmth
of
the
stomach
and
luce
without
a
word
caressed
with
her
hands
the
ears
and
eyes
the
nose
and
lips
of
her
beloved
one
dear
spiritual
hands
which
seemed
as
in
the
tales
about
fairies
to
have
little
mouths
at
the
and
pierre
a
thinking
piano
divined
the
meaning
of
the
little
waves
that
sped
under
the
tips
the
emotions
that
passed
through
the
soul
of
his
darling
he
heard
her
sigh
before
she
had
begun
to
sigh
luce
had
raised
herself
with
her
body
leaning
forward
and
with
breathing
oppressed
she
moaned
in
a
whisper
pierre
oh
pierre
pierre
looked
at
her
troubled
oh
pierre
what
are
we
anyway
what
is
it
they
want
of
us
what
do
we
want
what
is
this
going
on
within
us
these
guns
these
birds
this
war
this
love
these
hands
body
eyes
where
am
i
and
what
am
i
pierre
who
did
not
recognize
this
expression
of
bewilderment
in
her
wanted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
but
she
repulsed
him
no
no
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
she
thrust
face
and
hands
together
into
the
grass
pierre
was
upset
and
begged
of
her
luce
he
thrust
his
head
close
to
that
of
luce
luce
he
repeated
what
the
matter
with
you
is
it
against
me
she
raised
her
head
no
and
he
saw
tears
in
her
eyes
are
you
in
trouble
yes
why
i
do
know
tell
me
ah
i
ashamed
she
said
ashamed
about
what
about
everything
she
fell
silent
since
the
morning
she
had
been
haunted
by
a
sorrowful
memory
painful
and
degrading
her
mother
crazed
by
the
poison
that
crept
about
in
the
promiscuous
conditions
of
the
factories
made
for
luxury
and
for
murder
in
those
human
vats
no
longer
kept
up
any
restraint
upon
herself
at
home
she
had
indulged
in
a
scene
of
furious
jealousy
with
her
lover
without
caring
if
her
daughter
heard
and
luce
had
learned
that
her
mother
was
with
child
for
her
this
was
like
a
blot
that
extended
to
herself
whose
entire
love
whose
love
for
pierre
was
polluted
thereby
that
is
why
when
pierre
had
approached
her
she
had
repulsed
him
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
and
of
him
ashamed
of
him
poor
pierre
he
remained
there
humiliated
and
not
daring
to
budge
any
more
she
was
struck
with
remorse
smiled
in
the
midst
of
tears
and
resting
her
head
on
pierre
knees
said
it
is
my
turn
still
disquieted
pierre
smoothed
her
hair
as
one
pets
a
cat
he
murmured
luce
what
is
all
this
tell
me
nothing
she
responded
i
seen
sorrowful
things
he
had
too
much
respect
for
her
secrets
to
insist
but
luce
went
on
a
few
minutes
later
ah
there
are
moments
one
is
ashamed
to
belong
to
mankind
pierre
trembled
yes
said
he
and
after
a
silence
bending
over
he
said
very
low
forgive
me
luce
sprang
up
impetuously
threw
herself
on
pierre
neck
repeating
forgive
me
and
their
mouths
found
each
other
the
two
children
felt
the
need
of
consoling
one
another
both
of
them
without
saying
it
aloud
they
were
thinking
luckily
we
are
going
to
die
the
most
frightful
thing
would
be
to
become
one
of
those
men
who
are
proud
of
being
man
to
destroy
to
render
vile
lips
touching
lips
eyelashes
brushing
eyelashes
they
plunged
their
gaze
one
in
the
other
smiling
and
with
a
tender
pity
they
did
not
tire
of
that
divine
sentiment
which
is
the
purest
form
of
love
at
last
they
tore
themselves
from
their
contemplation
and
luce
with
eyes
again
serene
perceived
once
more
the
gentle
hue
of
the
sky
the
sweetness
of
the
renewing
trees
and
the
breath
of
flowers
how
lovely
it
all
is
she
exclaimed
she
was
thinking
why
are
things
so
beautiful
and
we
so
poor
so
mediocre
so
ugly
unless
it
be
you
my
love
unless
it
be
you
she
gazed
at
pierre
again
pshaw
what
are
others
to
me
and
with
the
magnificent
illogicality
of
love
she
burst
out
laughing
sprang
up
with
a
leap
rushed
into
the
wood
and
cried
catch
me
catch
me
they
played
like
two
children
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
when
they
were
very
tired
they
returned
with
slow
steps
toward
the
valley
filled
like
a
basket
with
the
sheaves
of
the
setting
sun
everything
they
savored
seemed
new
to
them
with
one
heart
for
two
with
two
bodies
for
one
they
were
five
friends
about
the
same
age
met
together
at
the
house
of
one
of
them
five
young
comrades
at
their
studies
whom
a
certain
conformity
of
mind
and
a
first
sorting
out
of
opinions
had
grouped
together
apart
from
the
rest
and
yet
no
two
of
them
who
thought
the
same
way
beneath
the
pretended
unanimity
of
forty
millions
of
frenchmen
there
are
forty
million
brains
that
keep
right
to
themselves
thought
in
france
is
like
the
country
a
state
composed
of
small
properties
from
one
bit
of
farm
to
the
other
the
five
friends
tried
to
exchange
their
ideas
across
the
hedge
but
they
did
that
only
to
affirm
themselves
more
imperatively
in
their
several
opinions
each
for
himself
each
one
for
that
matter
liberal
in
mind
and
if
not
all
of
them
republicans
all
foes
of
intellectual
or
social
reaction
or
any
backward
return
jacques
sée
was
the
most
blazingly
in
favor
of
the
war
this
generous
young
jew
had
espoused
all
the
passions
the
spirit
of
france
contained
all
through
europe
his
cousins
in
israel
espoused
like
him
the
causes
and
the
ideas
of
their
adopted
countries
moreover
according
to
their
method
they
even
had
a
tendency
toward
an
exaggeration
of
whatever
they
adopted
this
fine
fellow
with
ardent
but
rather
heavy
voice
and
look
with
his
regular
features
as
if
marked
with
a
stamp
imposed
was
more
pronounced
in
his
convictions
than
was
needful
and
violent
in
contradiction
according
to
him
all
that
was
necessary
was
a
crusade
made
by
the
democracies
to
deliver
the
nations
and
extinguish
war
four
years
of
the
philanthropic
slaughterhouse
had
not
convinced
him
he
was
one
of
those
who
will
never
accept
the
flat
contradiction
of
facts
he
had
a
twofold
pride
the
secret
pride
of
his
race
which
race
he
wished
to
rehabilitate
and
his
pride
personal
that
wanted
to
prove
itself
right
he
wished
this
all
the
more
because
he
was
not
entirely
sure
of
it
his
sincere
idealism
served
as
a
screen
against
exacting
instincts
too
long
suppressed
and
to
a
need
for
action
and
adventure
which
was
no
less
sincere
antoine
naudé
he
too
was
for
the
war
but
that
was
because
he
could
not
do
otherwise
this
big
honest
young
with
his
rosy
cheeks
placid
and
keen
who
had
a
short
breath
and
rolled
his
with
the
pretty
grace
of
the
provinces
of
the
centre
contemplated
with
a
quiet
smile
the
enthusiastic
transports
of
his
friend
sée
or
else
he
knew
how
on
occasion
to
make
him
climb
a
tree
with
a
careless
word
but
the
big
lazy
fellow
took
precious
care
not
to
follow
him
up
what
is
the
use
of
getting
in
a
sweat
for
or
against
what
does
not
depend
upon
ourselves
it
is
only
in
the
tragedies
that
one
finds
the
heroic
and
loquacious
conflict
between
duty
and
one
pleasure
when
we
have
no
choice
we
do
our
duty
without
wasting
words
it
was
no
jollier
on
that
account
naudé
neither
admired
nor
recriminated
his
good
sense
told
him
that
once
the
train
started
and
the
war
in
motion
it
was
necessary
to
roll
along
with
it
there
was
no
other
position
to
take
as
for
searching
after
the
responsibilities
that
was
merely
time
lost
when
i
am
forced
to
fight
it
gives
me
a
gay
outlook
a
pretty
consolation
to
know
that
i
might
have
not
fought
if
things
had
really
been
what
they
have
been
the
responsibilities
now
for
bernard
saisset
they
were
exactly
the
primordial
question
he
was
obstinate
in
disentangling
that
knot
of
snakes
or
rather
like
a
little
fury
he
brandished
the
snakes
above
his
head
a
frail
boy
distinguished
looking
impassioned
too
many
nerves
burning
with
a
too
lively
sensitiveness
of
the
brain
belonging
to
the
wealthy
and
an
old
republican
family
which
had
played
a
part
in
the
highest
offices
of
state
he
professed
through
reaction
all
the
passions
he
had
inspected
too
near
at
hand
the
masters
of
the
day
and
what
they
brought
forth
he
accused
all
the
governments
and
by
preference
his
own
he
talked
of
nothing
any
more
but
of
syndicalists
and
bolsheviki
he
had
just
made
a
discovery
of
them
and
he
fraternized
with
them
as
if
he
had
known
them
from
infancy
without
knowing
too
well
which
he
saw
no
remedy
save
in
a
total
upset
of
society
he
hated
war
but
he
would
have
sacrificed
himself
with
joy
in
a
war
between
classes
a
war
against
his
own
class
a
war
against
himself
the
fourth
in
the
group
claude
puget
sat
by
at
these
jousts
of
words
with
a
cold
and
somewhat
disdainful
attention
coming
from
the
very
undermost
poor
uprooted
from
his
province
by
a
passing
inspector
of
schools
who
remarked
his
intelligence
prematurely
deprived
of
the
intimate
influence
of
his
family
this
winner
of
a
scholarship
accustomed
to
depend
upon
himself
alone
to
live
only
with
himself
merely
lived
by
himself
and
for
himself
an
egotistic
philosopher
given
to
analysis
of
the
soul
voluptuously
immersed
in
his
introspection
like
a
big
cat
curled
up
in
a
ball
he
was
not
moved
at
all
by
the
agitation
of
the
others
these
three
friends
of
his
who
never
could
agree
among
themselves
he
put
in
the
same
bag
with
the
populars
did
not
all
three
forfeit
their
social
rank
by
wishing
to
partake
in
the
aspirations
of
the
mob
truth
to
say
the
mob
was
a
different
crowd
for
each
of
them
but
for
puget
the
crowd
whatever
it
might
be
was
always
wrong
the
crowd
was
the
enemy
the
intellect
should
remain
alone
and
follow
its
particular
laws
and
found
apart
from
the
vulgar
crowd
and
the
state
the
small
and
closed
kingdom
of
thought
and
pierre
seated
near
the
window
distractedly
looked
out
of
doors
and
dreamed
generally
speaking
he
mingled
in
these
juvenile
assaults
with
passion
but
today
it
seemed
to
him
a
humming
of
idle
words
which
he
listened
to
from
so
far
away
oh
so
far
away
in
a
bored
and
mocking
plunged
in
their
discussions
the
others
were
a
long
while
in
remarking
his
muteness
but
at
last
saisset
accustomed
to
find
in
pierre
an
echo
of
his
verbal
bolshevisms
was
astonished
at
failing
to
hear
it
reverberate
any
more
and
put
the
question
to
him
pierre
waked
up
in
a
hurry
reddened
smiled
and
asked
what
were
you
talking
about
they
were
most
indignant
why
you
have
been
listening
to
anything
what
then
were
you
brooding
about
asked
naudé
a
little
confused
a
little
impertinent
pierre
replied
about
the
springtide
it
has
come
back
all
right
without
your
permission
it
will
clear
out
without
our
help
all
of
them
crushed
him
with
their
disdain
naudé
taunted
him
as
a
poet
and
jacques
sée
as
a
puget
alone
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
with
curiosity
and
irony
in
them
his
wrinkled
eyes
with
their
cold
pupils
flying
ant
what
questioned
pierre
rather
amused
beware
of
the
wings
said
puget
it
the
nuptial
flight
it
only
lasts
one
hour
life
does
not
last
much
more
said
pierre
during
passion
week
they
saw
one
another
every
day
pierre
went
to
see
luce
in
her
isolated
house
the
thin
and
hungry
garden
was
waking
up
they
passed
the
afternoon
there
they
felt
now
an
antipathy
toward
paris
and
the
crowd
against
life
also
at
certain
moments
even
a
moral
paralysis
kept
them
silent
immovable
one
close
to
the
other
without
a
wish
to
stir
a
strange
feeling
was
at
work
in
both
of
them
they
were
afraid
fear
in
the
measure
that
the
day
approached
when
they
should
give
themselves
the
one
to
the
other
fear
through
excess
of
love
through
the
purification
of
soul
which
the
ugly
things
the
cruelties
the
shameful
facts
of
life
frightened
and
which
in
an
intoxication
of
passion
and
melancholy
dreamed
of
being
delivered
from
it
all
they
said
nothing
about
it
to
each
other
the
most
of
their
time
they
passed
in
babbling
gently
about
their
future
lodgings
their
work
in
common
their
little
household
they
arranged
in
advance
down
to
the
smallest
item
of
their
installation
the
furniture
the
wall
papers
the
spot
for
each
object
a
true
woman
the
evocation
of
these
tender
nothings
intimate
and
familiar
images
of
daily
life
moved
luce
sometimes
to
tears
they
tasted
the
exquisite
small
joys
of
the
hearth
of
the
future
they
knew
that
nothing
of
that
sort
would
occur
pierre
through
the
presentiment
of
his
native
pessimism
luce
through
the
clairvoyance
of
love
which
understood
the
practical
impossibility
of
the
marriage
that
is
why
they
hasted
to
enjoy
it
in
their
dream
and
each
concealed
from
the
other
the
certainty
felt
that
it
would
not
be
anything
else
but
a
dream
each
one
believed
that
this
secret
was
personal
and
watched
deeply
touched
over
the
other
illusion
when
they
had
exhausted
the
mournful
delights
of
the
impossible
future
they
were
overcome
with
fatigue
as
if
they
had
lived
through
all
of
it
then
they
rested
themselves
seated
under
the
arbor
with
the
vines
while
the
sun
melted
the
congealed
sap
and
pierre
head
on
luce
shoulder
they
listened
dreamily
to
the
humming
of
the
earth
behind
the
passing
clouds
the
young
sun
of
march
played
laughed
and
disappeared
clear
sunrays
somber
shadows
ran
across
the
plain
as
in
a
soul
run
joys
and
sorrows
luce
said
pierre
abruptly
do
you
recollect
it
was
long
long
ago
even
then
we
were
like
this
yes
said
luce
that
true
all
of
it
i
remember
all
but
where
were
we
they
amused
themselves
by
trying
to
recall
under
what
shapes
they
had
known
one
another
before
already
as
human
beings
perhaps
but
certainly
at
that
time
pierre
was
the
girl
and
luce
the
lover
birds
in
the
air
when
she
was
a
small
child
her
mother
told
luce
that
she
had
been
a
little
wild
goose
that
had
fallen
down
the
chimney
ah
she
had
thoroughly
broken
her
wings
but
where
particularly
they
enjoyed
finding
themselves
again
was
in
the
elementary
fluid
forms
that
penetrate
one
another
twist
about
and
untwist
like
the
volutes
of
a
dream
or
else
of
smoke
white
clouds
that
dissolve
in
the
gulf
of
the
sky
little
waves
that
play
about
the
rain
on
the
soil
the
dew
on
the
bush
seeds
of
dandelion
that
swim
at
the
beck
of
the
air
but
the
wind
carries
them
away
provided
it
does
not
begin
to
blow
again
and
that
we
shall
not
lose
each
other
any
more
for
all
eternity
but
he
decided
as
for
me
i
believe
that
we
never
did
quit
one
another
we
were
together
just
as
we
are
now
lying
against
each
other
only
we
were
asleep
and
we
dreamed
dreams
from
time
to
time
we
awake
with
difficulty
i
feel
your
breath
your
cheek
against
mine
one
makes
a
great
effort
we
bring
our
mouths
together
one
falls
back
asleep
darling
darling
i
am
here
i
hold
your
hand
do
let
me
go
now
it
is
not
quite
yet
the
hour
spring
hardly
shows
the
end
of
his
icy
nose
like
yours
said
luce
very
soon
we
shall
awake
on
a
fine
summer
day
we
ourselves
shall
be
that
fine
day
of
summer
says
luce
the
warm
shade
of
the
limetrees
the
sun
through
the
branches
the
bees
that
sing
the
peach
on
the
warm
wall
and
its
perfumed
pulp
the
noon
spell
of
the
harvesters
and
their
golden
sheaves
the
lazy
cattle
that
chew
their
cud
and
at
evensong
by
the
sunset
like
a
flowerset
pool
the
liquid
light
that
runs
across
the
tops
of
the
fields
yes
we
shall
be
everything
quoth
luce
everything
that
is
good
and
sweet
to
see
and
to
have
to
kiss
and
to
eat
to
touch
and
inhale
what
left
over
we
shall
leave
to
them
she
added
pointing
to
the
city
and
its
smoke
wreaths
she
laughed
then
kissing
her
friend
she
said
we
have
chanted
our
little
duet
well
what
do
you
say
my
friend
pierrot
yea
verily
jessica
he
replied
my
poor
pierrot
she
returned
we
are
none
too
well
equipped
for
this
world
where
people
know
how
to
sing
nothing
else
but
the
good
enough
if
they
even
knew
how
to
sing
that
we
have
got
off
at
the
wrong
station
we
left
the
train
too
early
i
afraid
said
pierre
that
the
next
station
would
have
been
still
worse
can
you
see
us
my
darling
in
the
social
fabric
of
the
future
the
hive
they
promise
us
where
none
will
have
the
right
to
live
except
for
the
queen
bee
service
or
for
the
republic
laying
eggs
from
morning
to
night
like
a
or
from
morning
to
night
licking
the
eggs
of
others
thank
you
for
that
choice
said
luce
oh
luce
little
ugly
one
how
ugly
you
talk
said
pierre
laughing
yes
it
very
bad
i
know
it
i
am
good
for
nothing
nor
you
either
my
friend
you
are
just
as
ill
fitted
for
killing
or
maiming
men
as
i
am
for
sewing
them
up
again
like
those
wretched
horses
when
they
are
ripped
up
at
the
bullfights
so
that
they
can
serve
again
at
the
next
affray
we
two
are
useless
beings
and
dangerous
who
have
the
ridiculous
criminal
pretention
to
live
only
in
order
to
love
those
we
do
love
likewise
my
little
lover
lad
and
my
friends
honest
people
and
little
children
the
good
light
of
the
day
also
good
white
bread
and
everything
that
is
pretty
and
right
for
me
to
put
in
my
mouth
shameful
it
shameful
blush
for
me
pierrot
but
we
shall
be
well
punished
there
is
going
to
be
no
place
for
us
in
that
factory
of
the
state
without
rest
and
without
truce
which
the
earth
will
be
soon
luckily
we
shall
not
be
here
yes
what
happiness
quoth
pierre
if
in
thine
arms
o
lady
of
my
heart
i
die
to
greater
fame
i
not
aspire
content
upon
thy
bosom
to
expire
whilst
kissing
thee
and
thus
from
living
part
well
little
darling
what
sort
of
a
fashion
is
that
nevertheless
it
is
after
a
good
old
french
mode
it
by
ronsard
said
pierre
else
i
would
only
claim
a
century
hence
sans
glory
and
sans
fame
slothful
to
die
upon
thy
lap
cassandra
a
hundred
years
sighed
luce
he
does
ask
much
or
i
mistake
or
more
delights
are
heaped
in
death
like
that
than
all
the
honors
reaped
by
caesar
great
or
firebolt
alexander
naughty
naughty
naughty
little
scamp
have
you
no
shame
in
this
epoch
of
heroes
there
are
too
many
said
pierre
i
would
rather
be
a
little
fellow
who
loves
a
babe
of
a
man
the
babe
of
a
woman
who
still
has
on
his
lips
the
milk
from
my
breast
cried
luce
seizing
him
round
the
neck
my
babe
my
own
survivors
of
those
days
who
since
then
have
been
witness
to
the
dazzling
change
of
fortune
will
have
forgotten
doubtless
the
menacing
heavy
flight
of
the
dark
wing
which
during
that
week
covered
the
ile
de
france
and
touched
paris
with
its
shadow
joy
does
not
take
further
stock
in
past
the
german

of
its
summit

holy
tuesday
died
debussy
the
harmonious
a
lyre
that
is
snapped
poor
little
expiring
greece
what
will
remain
of
it
a
few
chiseled
vases
a
few
perfect
stelae
which
the
grass
will
invade
from
the
path
of
tombs
immortal
vestiges
of
ruined
athens
as
from
the
height
of
a
hill
pierre
and
luce
watched
the
shadow
that
moved
upon
the
town
still
wrapped
in
the
rays
of
their
love
they
waited
without
fear
for
the
end
of
the
brief
day
now
they
would
be
two
in
the
night
like
to
the
evening
there
rose
up
to
them
conjured
up
the
voluptuous
melancholy
of
the
lovely
chords
of
debussy
which
they
had
so
greatly
loved
more
than
it
had
ever
done
in
any
other
time
music
responded
to
the
need
of
their
hearts
music
was
the
only
art
which
rendered
the
voice
of
the
delivered
soul
behind
the
screen
of
forms
on
holy
thursday
they
walked
luce
on
pierre
arm
and
holding
his
hand
along
the
streets
of
the
suburb
soused
with
the
rain
gusts
of
wind
scurried
over
the
moistened
plain
they
noted
neither
rain
nor
wind
neither
the
hideousness
of
the
fields
nor
the
muddy
ways
they
seated
themselves
on
the
low
wall
of
a
park
a
section
of
which
had
recently
fallen
in
under
pierre
umbrella
which
scarcely
protected
her
head
and
shoulders
luce
her
legs
hanging
down
and
her
hands
wet
her
rubber
coat
all
steeped
looked
at
the
water
dripping
down
when
the
wind
stirred
the
branches
a
little
fire
of
drops
sounded
clop
clop
luce
was
silent
smiling
tranquilly
luminous
a
profound
joy
bathed
them
why
does
one
love
so
much
said
pierre
ah
pierre
you
do
not
love
me
so
very
much
if
you
ask
that
i
ask
you
that
said
pierre
in
order
to
make
you
say
what
i
know
just
as
well
as
you
you
want
me
to
give
you
some
compliments
but
you
be
neatly
caught
for
if
you
know
why
i
love
you
i
for
my
part
do
not
know
why
you
do
know
said
pierre
in
consternation
why
no
she
was
laughing
in
her
sleeve
and
there
is
no
need
at
all
why
i
should
know
when
one
asks
why
something
is
it
means
that
one
is
not
sure
about
it
that
the
thing
is
not
good
now
that
i
do
love
no
more
why
no
more
where
or
when
or
for
nor
how
either
my
love
is
my
love
is
all
beside
may
exist
if
it
cares
to
their
faces
kissed
each
other
the
rain
took
advantage
of
that
gliding
under
the
awkward
umbrella
in
order
to
brush
with
its
fingers
their
hair
and
cheeks
between
their
lips
they
drank
in
a
little
cold
drop
pierre
remarked
but
the
others
what
others
quoth
luce
the
poor
answered
pierre
all
those
who
are
not
us
let
them
do
as
we
do
let
them
love
and
be
loved
luce
all
the
world
can
not
do
that
why
yes
why
no
you
do
realize
the
value
of
the
gift
you
have
made
me
to
give
one
heart
to
love
one
lips
to
the
beloved
is
to
give
eyes
to
the
light
it
is
giving
it
taking
there
are
blind
people
we
can
not
cure
them
pierrot
let
do
the
seeing
for
them
pierre
remained
silent
what
are
you
thinking
of
asked
she
i
am
thinking
that
on
this
day
very
far
from
us
very
near
he
suffered
the
passion
he
who
came
on
earth
to
cure
the
blind
luce
took
his
hand
do
you
believe
in
him
no
luce
i
believe
no
longer
but
he
remains
always
the
friend
of
those
he
has
accepted
even
once
at
his
table
and
you
do
you
know
him
hardly
responded
luce
they
never
talked
to
me
about
him
but
without
knowing
him
i
love
him
for
i
know
that
he
loved
not
as
we
do
why
not
we
ourselves
have
a
poor
little
heart
that
knows
only
how
to
love
you
my
love
but
he
he
loved
all
of
us
but
it
always
the
same
love
would
you
like
we
should
go
tomorrow
asked
pierre
much
moved
in
honor
of
his
death
i
was
told
that
they
will
have
fine
music
at
saint
gervais
yes
i
would
love
well
to
go
to
church
with
you
on
that
day
i
am
sure
he
will
give
us
welcome
and
being
nearer
to
him
one
is
nearer
each
to
the
other
they
fell
silent
rain
rain
rain
the
rain
falls
the
night
falls
at
this
hour
tomorrow
said
she
we
shall
be
down
there
the
fog
was
penetrating
she
gave
a
little
shudder
darling
you
are
not
cold
he
asked
disquieted
she
rose
no
no
everything
is
love
to
me
i
love
everything
and
everything
loves
me
the
rain
loves
me
the
wind
loves
me
the
gray
sky
and
the
cold
and
my
little
greatly
beloved
for
holy
friday
the
heavens
remained
clothed
in
their
long
gray
veils
but
the
air
was
soft
and
calm
in
the
streets
one
saw
flowers
jonquils
stocks
pierre
took
a
few
which
she
kept
in
her
hand
they
followed
the
peaceful
quai
des
orfèvres
and
passed
along
the
base
of
pure
the
charm
of
the
old
city
clothed
in
a
discreet
light
surrounded
them
with
its
noble
gentleness
on
the
place
saint
gervais
pigeons
flew
up
under
their
feet
they
followed
them
with
their
eyes
about
the
façade
of
the
church
one
of
the
birds
settled
on
the
head
of
a
statue
at
the
top
of
the
steps
to
the
before
the
church
as
they
were
about
to
enter
luce
turned
about
and
perceived
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
a
few
steps
away
a
little
girl
with
reddish
hair
about
a
dozen
years
old
leaning
against
the
portal
both
arms
raised
above
her
head
who
was
looking
at
them
she
had
the
fine
and
somewhat
archaic
face
of
some
little
cathedral
statue
with
an
enigmatic
smile
graceful
shrewd
and
tender
luce
smiled
also
at
her
while
calling
pierre
attention
to
her
but
the
little
girl
gaze
passed
over
her
head
and
suddenly
changed
to
fright
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
the
child
vanished
what
is
the
matter
with
her
asked
luce
but
pierre
did
not
look
they
entered
above
their
heads
the
dove
was
cooing
last
noise
from
outside
the
voices
of
paris
were
quenched
the
fresh
air
ceased
the
hangings
of
the
organ
the
lofty
vaultings
the
curtain
of
stones
and
sounds
parted
them
from
the
world
they
installed
themselves
in
one
of
the
side
aisles
between
the
second
and
the
third
chapel
on
the
left
as
you
enter
in
the
hollow
of
a
pier
both
of
them
crouched
seated
on
some
steps
hidden
from
the
rest
of
the
assembly
turning
their
backs
to
the
choir
on
raising
their
eyes
they
saw
the
summit
of
the
altar
the
crucifix
and
the
stained
windows
of
a
lateral
chapel
the
beautiful
old
chants
wept
out
their
pious
melancholy
they
were
holding
hands
the
two
little
pagans
before
the
great
friend
in
the
church
all
swathed
in
mourning
and
both
of
them
at
the
same
time
murmured
in
a
low
voice
great
friend
before
your
face
i
take
him
i
take
her
unite
us
you
see
our
hearts
and
their
fingers
remained
joined
and
interlaced
like
the
straw
of
a
basket
they
were
one
single
flesh
which
the
waves
of
music
passed
through
with
their
shivering
notes
they
took
to
dreaming
as
if
they
lay
in
the
same
bed
luce
saw
again
in
her
thought
that
little
girl
with
reddish
hair
and
behold
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
recalled
how
she
had
seen
her
before
in
a
dream
the
past
night
she
could
not
reach
the
point
of
knowing
whether
that
was
actually
true
or
if
she
were
projecting
the
vision
of
the
present
back
to
the
past
slumber
then
weary
of
the
effort
her
thoughts
allowed
themselves
to
float
pierre
pondered
over
the
days
of
his
short
expended
life
the
lark
that
rises
from
the
misty
plain
to
reach
the
sun
how
far
it
is
how
high
it
is
will
it
ever
be
reached
the
fog
thickens
there
is
no
earth
any
more
there
are
no
heavens
any
more
and
strength
gives
out
suddenly
while
beneath
the
vault
of
the
choir
a
gregorian
trickled
down
the
jubilant
song
gushed
forth
and
out
from
the
shadows
emerges
the
little
shivering
form
of
the
lark
that
swims
on
the
sea
of
light
without
shore
a
pressure
of
their
fingers
recalled
to
them
that
they
were
swimming
together
they
found
themselves
again
in
the
darkness
of
the
church
closely
pressed
together
listening
to
the
beautiful
chants
their
hearts
melted
with
love
and
touched
the
summits
of
the
purest
joy
and
both
of
them
desired
they
prayed
never
to
descend
to
earth
again
at
that
moment
luce
who
had
just
kissed
her
dear
little
comrade
with
a
passionate
glance
his
eyes
half
closed
and
his
lips
parted
he
appeared
lost
in
an
ecstasy
of
happiness
and
raised
his
head
in
a
rush
of
thankful
joy
toward
that
supreme
power
which
we
look
for
instinctively
on
high
luce
saw
with
terror
in
the
red
and
gilded
window
of
the
chapel
the
face
of
the
child
of
the
who
was
smiling
at
her
and
as
she
sat
mute
frozen
with
astonishment
she
saw
once
more
on
that
strange
visage
the
same
expression
of
fright
and
of
pity
and
at
the
same
instant
the
great
pier
against
which
they
leaned
their
backs
moved
and
down
to
its
very
base
the
entire
church
trembled
and
luce
whose
heart
beats
deadened
in
her
the
crash
of
the
explosion
and
the
shrieks
of
the
crowd
threw
herself
without
having
time
to
fear
or
to
suffer
upon
pierre
in
order
to
cover
him
with
her
body
like
a
hen
with
her
brood
upon
pierre
who
with
closed
eyes
was
smiling
with
happiness
with
a
maternal
movement
she
clasped
the
dear
head
against
her
bosom
and
that
with
all
her
power
and
coiled
upon
him
her
mouth
on
his
neck
they
shrank
together
to
their
utmost
and
the
massive
pier
crumbled
down
upon
them
with
one
crash
the
end
