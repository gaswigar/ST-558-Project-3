iago
roderigo
tush
never
tell
me
i
take
it
much
unkindly
that
thou
iago
who
hast
had
my
purse
as
if
the
strings
were
thine
shouldst
know
of
this
iago
but
you
will
not
hear
me
if
ever
i
did
dream
of
such
a
matter
abhor
me
roderigo
thou
me
thou
didst
hold
him
in
thy
hate
iago
despise
me
if
i
do
not
three
great
ones
of
the
city
in
personal
suit
to
make
me
his
lieutenant
to
him
and
by
the
faith
of
man
i
know
my
price
i
am
worth
no
worse
a
place
but
he
as
loving
his
own
pride
and
purposes
evades
them
with
a
bumbast
circumstance
horribly
stuff
with
epithets
of
war
and
in
conclusion
nonsuits
my
mediators
for
certes
says
he
i
have
already
chose
my
officer
and
what
was
he
forsooth
a
great
arithmetician
one
michael
cassio
a
florentine
a
fellow
almost
damn
in
a
fair
wife
that
never
set
a
squadron
in
the
field
nor
the
division
of
a
battle
knows
more
than
a
spinster
unless
the
bookish
theoric
wherein
the
toged
consuls
can
propose
as
masterly
as
he
mere
prattle
without
practice
is
all
his
soldiership
but
he
sir
had
the
election
and
i
of
whom
his
eyes
had
seen
the
proof
at
rhodes
at
cyprus
and
on
other
grounds
christian
and
heathen
must
be
belee
and
by
debitor
and
creditor
this
he
in
good
time
must
his
lieutenant
be
and
god
bless
the
mark
his
moorship
ancient
roderigo
by
heaven
i
rather
would
have
been
his
hangman
iago
why
there
no
remedy
is
the
curse
of
service
preferment
goes
by
letter
and
affection
and
not
by
old
gradation
where
each
second
stood
heir
to
the
first
now
sir
be
judge
yourself
whether
i
in
any
just
term
am
affined
to
love
the
moor
roderigo
i
would
not
follow
him
then
iago
o
sir
content
you
i
follow
him
to
serve
my
turn
upon
him
we
can
not
all
be
masters
nor
all
masters
can
not
be
truly
follow
you
shall
mark
many
a
duteous
and
knave
that
doting
on
his
own
obsequious
bondage
wears
out
his
time
much
like
his
master
ass
for
nought
but
provender
and
when
he
old
cashier
whip
me
such
honest
knaves
others
there
are
who
trimm
in
forms
and
visages
of
duty
keep
yet
their
hearts
attending
on
themselves
and
throwing
but
shows
of
service
on
their
lords
do
well
thrive
by
them
and
when
they
have
lined
their
coats
do
themselves
homage
these
fellows
have
some
soul
and
such
a
one
do
i
profess
myself
for
sir
it
is
as
sure
as
you
are
roderigo
were
i
the
moor
i
would
not
be
iago
in
following
him
i
follow
but
myself
heaven
is
my
judge
not
i
for
love
and
duty
but
seeming
so
for
my
peculiar
end
for
when
my
outward
action
doth
demonstrate
the
native
act
and
figure
of
my
heart
in
complement
extern
is
not
long
after
but
i
will
wear
my
heart
upon
my
sleeve
for
daws
to
peck
at
i
am
not
what
i
am
roderigo
what
a
full
fortune
does
the
owe
if
he
can
thus
iago
call
up
her
father
rouse
him
make
after
him
poison
his
delight
proclaim
him
in
the
streets
incense
her
kinsmen
and
though
he
in
a
fertile
climate
dwell
plague
him
with
flies
though
that
his
joy
be
joy
yet
throw
such
changes
of
vexation
as
it
may
lose
some
color
roderigo
here
is
her
father
house
i
call
aloud
iago
do
with
like
timorous
accent
and
dire
yell

night
and
negligence

populous

plainness
thou

say
my
daughter
is
not
for
thee
and
now
in
madness
being
full
of
supper
and
distempering
draughts
upon
malicious
bravery
dost
thou
come
to
start
my
quiet
roderigo
sir
sir
brabantio
but
thou
must
needs
be
sure

spirit
and
my
place
have
in
them
power
to
make
this
bitter
to
thee
roderigo
patience

grange
roderigo
most
grave
brabantio
in
simple
and
pure
soul
i
come
to
you
iago
sir
you
are
one
of
those
that
will
not
serve
god
if
the
devil
bid
you
because
we
come
to
do
you
service
and
you
think
we
are
ruffians
you
have
your
daughter
covered
with
a
barbary
horse
you
have
your
nephews
neigh
to
you
have
coursers
for
cousins
and
gennets
for
germans
brabantio
what
profane
wretch
art
thou
iago
i
am
one
sir
that
comes
to
tell
you
your
daughter
and
the
moor
are
now
making
the
beast
with
two
backs
brabantio
thou
are
a
villain
iago
you
a
senator
brabantio
this
thou
shalt
answer
i
know
thee
roderigo
roderigo
sir
i
will
answer
anything
but
i
beseech
you
be
your
pleasure
and
most
wise
consent
as
partly
i
find
it
is
that
your
fair
daughter
at
this
and
dull
watch
o
the
night
transported
with
no
worse
nor
better
guard
but
with
a
knave
of
common
hire
a
gondolier
to
the
gross
clasps
of
a
lascivious
if
this
be
known
to
you
and
your
allowance
we
then
have
done
you
bold
and
saucy
wrongs
but
if
you
know
not
this
my
manners
tell
me
we
have
your
wrong
rebuke
do
not
believe
that
from
the
sense
of
all
civility
i
thus
would
play
and
trifle
with
your
reverence
your
daughter
if
you
have
not
given
her
leave
i
say
again
hath
made
a
gross
revolt
tying
her
duty
beauty
wit
and
fortunes
in
an
extravagant
and
wheeling
stranger
of
here
and
everywhere
straight
satisfy
yourself
if
she
be
in
her
chamber
or
your
house
let
loose
on
me
the
justice
of
the
state
for
thus
deluding
you
brabantio
strike
on
the
tinder
ho
give
me
a
taper
call
up
all
my
people
this
accident
is
not
unlike
my
dream
belief
of
it
oppresses
me
already
light
i
say
light
exit
above
iago
farewell
for
i
must
leave
you
it
seems
not
meet
nor
wholesome
to
my
place
to
be
as
if
i
stay
i
against
the
moor
for
i
do
know
the
state
however
this
may
gall
him
with
some
check
can
not
with
safety
cast
him
for
he
with
such
loud
reason
to
the
cyprus
wars
which
even
now
stands
in
act
that
for
their
souls
another
of
his
fathom
they
have
none
to
lead
their
business
in
which
regard
though
i
do
hate
him
as
i
do
hell
pains
yet
for
necessity
of
present
life
i
must
show
out
a
flag
and
sign
of
love
which
is
indeed
but
sign
that
you
shall
surely
find
him
lead
to
the
sagittary
the
raised
search
and
there
will
i
be
with
him
so
farewell
exit
enter
below
brabantio
in
his
nightgown
and
servants
with
torches
brabantio
it
is
too
true
an
evil
gone
she
is
and
what
to
come
of
my
despised
time
is
nought
but
bitterness
now
roderigo
where
didst
thou
see
her
o
unhappy
girl
with
the
moor
thou
who
would
be
a
father
how
didst
thou
know
was
she
o
she
deceives

past
thought

said
she
to
you
get
more
tapers
raise
all
my
kindred

treason
of
the
blood

from
hence

not
your
daughters

what

there
not
charms
by
which
the
property
of
youth
and
maidhood
may
be
abused

you
not
read
roderigo
of
some
such
thing
roderigo

up
my
brother

had
her
some
one
way

another

you
know
where
we
may
apprehend
her
and

moor
roderigo
i
think
i
can
discover
him
if
you
please
to
get
good
guard
and
go
along
with
me
brabantio
pray
you
lead

most

othello
iago
and
attendants
with
torches
iago
though
in
the
trade
of

i
have
slain
men
yet

i
hold
it
very
stuff
o
the
conscience
to
do
no
contrived
murther
i
lack
iniquity
sometimes
to
do
me
service
nine
or
ten
times
i
had
thought
to
have
yerk
him
here
under
the
ribs
othello
is
better
as
it
is
iago
nay
but
he
prated
and
spoke
such
scurvy
and
provoking
terms
against
your
honor
that
with
the
little
godliness
i
have
i
did
full
hard
forbear
him
but
i
pray
you
sir
are
you
fast
married
be
assured
of
this

the
magnifico

much
beloved

effect
a
voice

double

divorce
you

put
upon
you

grievance

might

spite

services

i
have
done

which

i
know
that
boasting

an
honor

fetch
my
life

being
from
men
of
royal
siege
and
my
demerits

proud
a
fortune

i
have
reach
for

brabantio
o
thou
foul
thief
where
hast
thou
stow
my
daughter
damn
as
thou
art
thou
hast
enchanted
her
for
i
refer
me
to
all
things
of
sense
if
she
in
chains
of
magic
were
not
bound
whether
a
maid
so
tender
fair
and
happy
so
opposite
to
marriage
that
she
the
wealthy
curled
darlings
of
our
nation
would
ever
have
to
incur
a
general
mock
run
from
her
guardage
to
the
sooty
bosom
of
such
a
thing
as
to
fear
not
to
delight
judge
me
the
world
if
is
not
gross
in
sense
that
thou
hast
practiced
on
her
with
foul
charms
abused
her
delicate
youth
with
drugs
or
minerals
that
weaken
motion
i
disputed
on
is
probable
and
palpable
to
thinking
i
therefore
apprehend
and
do
attach
thee
for
an
abuser
of
the
world
a
practicer
of
arts
inhibited
and
out
of
warrant
lay
hold
upon
him
if
he
do
resist
subdue
him
at
his
peril
othello
hold
your
hands
both
you
of
my
inclining
and
the
rest
were
it
my
cue
to
fight
i
should
have
known
it
without
a
prompter
where
will
you
that
i
go
to
answer
this
your
charge
brabantio
to
prison
till
fit
time
of
law
and
course
of
direct
session
call
thee
to
answer
othello
what
if
i
do
obey
how
may
the
duke
be
therewith
satisfied
whose
messengers
are
here
about
my
side
upon
some
present
business
of
the
state
to
bring
me
to
him
first
officer
is
true
most
worthy
signior
the
duke
in
council
and
your
noble
self
i
am
sure
is
sent
for
brabantio
how
the
duke
in
council
in
this
time
of
the
night
bring
him
away
mine
not
an
idle
cause
the
duke
himself
or
any
of
my
brothers
of
the
state
can
not
but
feel
this
wrong
as
their
own
for
if
such
actions
may
have
passage
free

our
statesmen
be
exeunt
scene
iii
a
council
chamber
the
duke
and
senators
sitting
at
a
table
officers
attending
duke
there
is
no
composition
in
these
news
that
gives
them
credit
first
senator
indeed
they
are
disproportion
my
letters
say
a
hundred
and
seven
galleys
duke
and
mine
a
hundred
and
forty
second
senator
and
mine
two
hundred
but
though
they
jump
not
on
a
just
as
in
these
cases
where
the
aim
reports
is
oft
with
yet
do
they
all
confirm
a
turkish
fleet
and
bearing
up
to
cyprus
duke
nay
it
is
possible
enough
to
judgement
i
do
not
so
secure
me
in
the
error
but
the
main
article
i
do
approve
in
fearful
sense
sailor

this

no
assay

a
pageant
to
keep
us
in
false
gaze
when
we
consider
the
importancy
of
cyprus
to
the
turk
and
let
ourselves
again
but
understand
that
as
it
more
concerns
the
turk
than
rhodes
so
may
he
with
more
facile
question
bear
it
for
that
it
stands
not
in
such
warlike
brace
but
altogether
lacks
the
abilities
that
rhodes
is
dress
in
if
we
make
thought
of
this
we
must
not
think
the
turk
is
so
unskillful
to
leave
that
latest
which
concerns
him
first
neglecting
an
attempt
of
ease
and
gain

place

raised
me
from

nor
doth
the
general
care

hold
on

for
my
particular
grief

of
so
and
nature
that
it
engluts
and
swallows
other
sorrows

it
is
still
itself

daughter
o
my
daughter
all
dead
brabantio
ay
to
me
she
is
abused
from
me
and
corrupted
by
spells
and
medicines
bought
of
mountebanks
for
nature
so
preposterously
to
err
being
not
deficient
blind
or
lame
of
sense
sans
witchcraft
could
not
duke
he
be
that
in
this
foul
proceeding
hath
thus
beguiled
your
daughter
of
herself
and
you
of
her
the
bloody
book
of
law
you
shall
yourself
read
in
the
bitter
letter
after
your
own
sense
yea
though
our
proper
son
stood
in
your
action
brabantio
humbly
i
thank
your
grace
here
is
the
man
this
moor
whom
now
it
seems
your
special
mandate
for
the
state
affairs
hath
hither
brought
all
we
are
very
sorry
duke
to
othello
what
in
your
own
part
can
you
say
to
this
brabantio
nothing
but
this
is
so
othello
most
potent
grave
and
reverend
signiors
my
very
noble
and
approved
good
masters
that
i
have
away
this
old
man
daughter
it
is
most
true
true
i
have
married
her
the
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending
hath
this
extent
no
more
rude
am
i
in
my
speech
and
little
blest
with
the
soft
phrase
of
peace
for
since
these
arms
of
mine
had
seven
years
pith
till
now
some
nine
moons
wasted
they
have
used
their
dearest
action
in
the
tented
field
and
little
of
this
great
world
can
i
speak
more
than
pertains
to
feats
of
broil
and
battle
and
therefore
little
shall
i
grace
my
cause
in
speaking
for
myself
yet
by
your
gracious
patience
i
will
a
round
unvarnish
tale
deliver
of
my
whole
course
of
love
what
drugs
what
charms
what
conjuration
and
what
mighty
for
such
proceeding
i
am
charged
i
won
his
daughter
brabantio
a
maiden
never
bold
of
spirit
so
still
and
quiet
that
her
motion
blush
at
herself
and
in
spite
of
nature
of
years
of
country
credit
to
fall
in
love
with
what
she
fear
to
look
on
it
is
judgement
maim
and
most
imperfect
that
will
confess
perfection
so
could
err
against
all
rules
of
nature
and
must
be
driven
to
find
out
practices
of
cunning
hell
why
this
should
be
i
therefore
vouch
again
that
with
some
mixtures
powerful
the
blood
or
with
some
dram
conjured
to
this
effect
he
wrought
upon
her
duke
to
vouch
this
is
no
proof
without
more
certain
and
more
overt
test
than
these
thin
habits
and
poor
likelihoods
of
modern
seeming
do
prefer
against
him
first
senator
but
othello
speak
did
you
by
indirect
and
forced
courses
subdue
and
poison
this
young
maid
affections
or
came
it
by
request
and
such
fair
question
as
soul
to
soul
affordeth
othello
i
do
beseech
you
send
for
the
lady
to
the
sagittary
and
let
her
speak
of
me
before
her
father
if
you
do
find
me
foul
in
her
report
the
trust
the
office
i
do
hold
of
you
not
only
take
away
but
let
your
sentence
even
fall
upon
my
life
duke
fetch
desdemona
hither
othello
ancient
conduct
them
you
best
know
the
place
exeunt
iago
and
attendants
and
till
she
come
as
truly
as
to
heaven
i
do
confess
the
vices
of
my
blood
so
justly
to
your
grave
ears
i
present
how
i
did
thrive
in
this
fair
lady
love
and
she
in
mine
duke
say
it
othello
othello
her
father
loved
me
oft
invited
me
still
question
me
the
story
of
my
life
from
year
to
year
the
battles
sieges
fortunes
that
i
have
pass
i
ran
it
through
even
from
my
boyish
days
to
the
very
moment
that
he
bade
me
tell
it
wherein
i
spake
of
most
disastrous
chances
of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
of
i
the
imminent
deadly
breach
of
being
taken
by
the
insolent
foe
and
sold
to
slavery
of
my
redemption
thence
and
portance
in
my
travels
history
wherein
of
antres
vast
and
deserts
idle
rough
quarries
rocks
and
hills
whose
heads
touch
heaven
it
was
my
hint
to
such
was
the
and
of
the
cannibals
that
each
other
eat
the
anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
this
to
hear
would
desdemona
seriously
incline
but
still
the
house
affairs
would
draw
her
thence
which
ever
as
she
could
with
haste
dispatch
come
again
and
with
a
greedy
ear
devour
up
my
discourse
which
i
observing
took
once
a
pliant
hour
and
found
good
means
to
draw
from
her
a
prayer
of
earnest
heart
that
i
would
all
my
pilgrimage
dilate
whereof
by
parcels
she
had
something
heard
but
not
intentively
i
did
consent
and
often
did
beguile
her
of
her
tears
when
i
did
speak
of
some
distressful
stroke
that
my
youth
suffer
my
story
being
done
she
gave
me
for
my
pains
a
world
of
sighs
she
swore
in
faith
was
strange
was
passing
strange
was
pitiful
was
wondrous
pitiful
she
wish
she
had
not
heard
it
yet
she
that
heaven
had
made
her
such
a
man
she
thank
me
and
bade
me
if
i
had
a
friend
that
loved
her
i
should
but
teach
him
how
to
tell
my
story
and
that
would
woo
her
upon
this
hint
i
spake
she
loved
me
for
the
dangers
i
had
pass
and
i
loved
her
that
she
did
pity
them
this
only
is
the
witchcraft
i
have
used
here
comes
the
lady
let
her
witness
it
enter
desdemona
iago
and
attendants
duke
i
think
this
tale
would
win
my
daughter
too
good
brabantio
take
up
this
mangled
matter
at
the
best
men
do
their
broken
weapons
rather
use
than
their
bare
hands
brabantio
i
pray
you
hear
her
speak
if
she
confess
that
she
was
half
the
wooer
destruction
on
my
head
if
my
bad
blame
light
on
the
man
come
hither
gentle
mistress
do
you
perceive
in
all
this
noble
company
where
most
you
owe
obedience
desdemona
my
noble
father
i
do
perceive
here
a
divided
duty
to
you
i
am
bound
for
life
and
education
my
life
and
education
both
do
learn
me
how
to
respect
you
you
are
the
lord
of
duty
i
am
hitherto
your
daughter
but
here
my
husband
and
so
much
duty
as
my
mother
to
you
preferring
you
before
her
father
so
much
i
challenge
that
i
may
profess
due
to
the
moor
my
lord
brabantio
god
be
with
you
i
have
done
please
it
your
grace
on
to
the
state
affairs
i
had
rather
to
adopt
a
child
than
get
it
come
hither
moor
i
here
do
give
thee
that
with
all
my
heart
which
but
thou
hast
already
with
all
my
heart
i
would
keep
from
thee
for
your
sake
jewel
i
am
glad
at
soul
i
have
no
other
child
for
thy
escape
would
teach
me
tyranny
to
hang
clogs
on
them
i
have
done
my
lord
duke
let
me
speak
like
yourself
and
lay
a
sentence
which
as
a
grise
or
step
may
help
these
lovers
into
your
favor
when
remedies
are
past
the
griefs
are
ended
by
seeing
the
worst
which
late
on
hopes
depended
to
mourn
a
mischief
that
is
past
and
gone
is
the
next
way
to
draw
new
mischief
on
what
can
not
be
preserved
when
fortune
takes
patience
her
injury
a
mockery
makes
the
robb
that
smiles
steals
something
from
the
thief
he
robs
himself
that
spends
a
bootless
grief
brabantio
so
let
the
turk
of
cyprus
us
beguile
we
lose
it
not
so
long
as
we
can
smile
he
bears
the
sentence
well
that
nothing
bears
but
the
free
comfort
which
from
thence
he
hears
but
he
bears
both
the
sentence
and
the
sorrow
that
to
pay
grief
must
of
poor
patience
borrow
these
sentences
to
sugar
or
to
gall
being
strong
on
both
sides
are
equivocal
but
words
are
words
i
never
yet
did
hear
that
the
bruised
heart
was
pierced
through
the
ear
i
humbly
beseech
you
proceed
to
the
affairs
of
state
duke
the
turk
with
a
most
mighty
preparation
makes
for
cyprus
othello
the
fortitude
of
the
place
is
best
known
to
you
and
though
we
have
there
a
substitute
of
most
allowed
sufficiency
yet
opinion
a
sovereign
mistress
of
effects
throws
a
more
safer
voice
on
you
you
must
therefore
be
content
to
slubber
the
gloss
of
your
new
fortunes
with
this
more
stubborn
and
boisterous
expedition
othello
the
tyrant
custom
most
grave
senators
hath
made
the
flinty
and
steel
couch
of
war
my
bed
of
down
i
do
agnize
a
natural
and
prompt
alacrity
i
find
in
hardness
and
do
undertake
these
present
wars
against
the
ottomites
most
humbly
therefore
bending
to
your
state
i
crave
fit
disposition
for
my
wife
due
reference
of
place
and
exhibition
with
such
accommodation
and
besort
as
levels
with
her
breeding
duke
if
you
please
at
her
father
brabantio
i
not
have
it
so
othello
nor
desdemona
nor
i
would
not
there
reside
to
put
my
father
in
impatient
thoughts
by
being
in
his
eye
most
gracious
duke
to
my
unfolding
lend
your
prosperous
ear
and
let
me
find
a
charter
in
your
voice
to
assist
my
simpleness
duke
what
would
you
desdemona
desdemona
that
i
did
love
the
moor
to
live
with
him
my
downright
violence
and
storm
of
fortunes
may
trumpet
to
the
world
my
heart
subdued
even
to
the
very
quality
of
my
lord
i
saw
othello
visage
in
his
mind
and
to
his
honors
and
his
valiant
parts
did
i
my
soul
and
fortunes
consecrate
so
that
dear
lords
if
i
be
left
behind
a
moth
of
peace
and
he
go
to
the
war
the
rites
for
which
i
love
him
are
bereft
me
and
i
a
heavy
interim
shall
support
by
his
dear
absence
let
me
go
with
him
othello
let
her
have
your
voices
vouch
with
me
heaven
i
therefore
beg
it
not
to
please
the
palate
of
my
appetite
nor
to
comply
with
the
young
affects
in
me
and
proper
satisfaction
but
to
be
free
and
bounteous
to
her
mind
and
heaven
defend
your
good
souls

you
think
i
will
your
serious

noble
signior
if

more
fair
than
black
first
senator
adieu
brave
moor
use
desdemona
well
brabantio
look
to
her
moor
if
thou
hast
eyes
to
see
she
has
deceived
her
father
and
may
thee
exeunt
duke
senators
and
officers
othello
my
life
upon
her
faith
honest
iago
my
desdemona
must
i
leave
to
thee
i
prithee
let
thy
wife
attend
on
her
and
bring
them
after
in
the
best
advantage
come
desdemona
i
have
but
an
hour
of
love
of
worldly
matters
and
direction
to
spend
with
thee
we
must
obey
the
time
exeunt
othello
and
desdemona
roderigo
iago
iago
what
thou
noble
heart
roderigo
what
will
i
do
thinkest
thou
iago
why
go
to
bed
and
sleep
roderigo
i
will
incontinently
drown
myself
iago
if
thou
dost
i
shall
never
love
thee
after
why
thou
silly
gentleman
roderigo
it
is
silliness
to
live
when
to
live
is
torment
and
then
have
we
a
prescription
to
die
when
death
is
our
physician
iago
o
villainous
i
have
looked
upon
the
world
for
four
times
seven
years
and
since
i
could
distinguish
betwixt
a
benefit
and
an
injury
i
never
found
man
that
knew
how
to
love
himself
ere
i
would
say
i
would
drown
myself
for
the
love
of
a
guinea
hen
i
would
change
my
humanity
with
a
baboon
roderigo
what
should
i
do
i
confess
it
is
my
shame
to
be
so
fond
but
it
is
not
in
my
virtue
to
amend
it
iago
virtue
a
fig
is
in
ourselves
that
we
are
thus
or
thus
our
bodies
are
gardens
to
the
which
our
wills
are
gardeners
so
that
if
we
will
plant
nettles
or
sow
lettuce
set
hyssop
and
weed
up
thyme
supply
it
with
one
gender
of
herbs
or
distract
it
with
many
either
to
have
it
sterile
with
idleness
or
manured
with
industry
why
the
power
and
corrigible
authority
of
this
lies
in
our
wills
if
the
balance
of
our
lives
had
not
one
scale
of
reason
to
poise
another
of
sensuality
the
blood
and
baseness
of
our
natures
would
conduct
us
to
most
preposterous
conclusions
but
we
have
reason
to
cool
our
raging
motions
our
carnal
stings
our
unbitted
lusts
whereof
i
take
this
that
you
call
love
to
be
a
sect
or
scion
roderigo
it
can
not
be
iago
it
is
merely
a
lust
of
the
blood
and
a
permission
of
the
will
come
be
a
man
drown
thyself
drown
cats
and
blind
puppies
i
have
professed
me
thy
friend
and
i
confess
me
knit
to
thy
deserving
with
cables
of
perdurable
toughness
i
could
never
better
stead
thee
than
now
put
money
in
thy
purse
follow
thou
the
wars
defeat
thy
favor
with
an
usurped
beard
i
say
put
money
in
thy
purse
it
can
not
be
that
desdemona
should
long
continue
her
love
to
the
put
money
in
thy
nor
he
his
to
her
it
was
a
violent
commencement
and
thou
shalt
see
an
answerable
put
but
money
in
thy
purse
these
moors
are
changeable
in
their
fill
thy
purse
with
money
the
food
that
to
him
now
is
as
luscious
as
locusts
shall
be
to
him
shortly
as
acerb
as
the
coloquintida
she
must
change
for
youth
when
she
is
sated
with
his
body
she
will
find
the
error
of
her
choice
she
must
have
change
she
must
therefore
put
money
in
thy
purse
if
thou
wilt
needs
damn
thyself
do
it
a
more
delicate
way
than
drowning
make
all
the
money
thou
canst
if
sanctimony
and
a
frail
vow
betwixt
an
erring
barbarian
and
a
supersubtle
venetian
be
not
too
hard
for
my
wits
and
all
the
tribe
of
hell
thou
shalt
enjoy
therefore
make
money
a
pox
of
drowning
thyself
it
is
clean
out
of
the
way
seek
thou
rather
to
be
hanged
in
compassing
thy
joy
than
to
be
drowned
and
go
without
her
roderigo
wilt
thou
be
fast
to
my
hopes
if
i
depend
on
the
issue
iago
thou
art
sure
of

i
have
told
thee
often

my

thine
hath
no

in
our
revenge

if
thou

there
are
many
events
in
the

of

what

do
beguile
the

i
am
by
seeming
otherwise
come
how
wouldst
thou
praise
me
iago
i
am
about
it
but
indeed
my
invention
comes
from
my
pate
as
birdlime
does
from
frieze
it
plucks
out
brains
and
all
but
my
muse
labors
and
thus

fairness
and

the

for

the

she
never

was
foolish
that

desdemona
these

fond
paradoxes
to

what
miserable
praise
hast
thou
for

that
foul
and
foolish
iago
there
none
so
foul

foolish
thereunto
but
does
foul
pranks
which
fair
and
wise
ones
do
desdemona
o
heavy
ignorance
thou
praisest
the
worst
best
but
what
praise
couldst
thou
bestow
on
a
deserving
woman
indeed
one
that
in
the
authority
of
her
merit
did
justly
put
on
the
vouch
of
very
malice
itself
iago
she
that
was
ever
fair
and
never
proud
had
tongue
at

and
yet
was
never
loud
never
lack

and
yet
went
never
gay
fled
from
her

yet
said
now
i
may
she
that
being
anger
her
revenge
being
nigh
bade
her
wrong
stay
and
her
displeasure
fly
she
that
in
wisdom
never
was
so
frail
to
change
the
cod
head
for
the
salmon
tail
she
that
could
think
and
disclose
her
mind
see
suitors
following
and
not
look
behind
she
was
a
wight
if
ever
such
wight
desdemona
to

what
iago
to
suckle
fools
and
chronicle
small

most
lame
and
impotent
conclusion

though
he
be
thy
husband
how

you
cassio
is
he
not
a
most
profane
and
liberal
counselor
cassio
he
speaks
home
madam
you
may
relish
him
more
in
the
soldier
than
in
the
scholar
iago
aside
he
takes
her
by
the
palm
ay
well
said
whisper
with
as
little
a
web
as
this
will
i
ensnare
as
great
a
fly
as
cassio
ay
smile
upon
her
do
i
will
gyve
thee
in
thine
own
courtship
you
say
true
is
so
indeed
if
such
tricks
as
these
strip
you
out
of
your
lieutenantry
it
had
been
better
you
had
not
kissed
your
three
fingers
so
oft
which
now
again
you
are
most
apt
to
play
the
sir
in
very
good
well
kissed
an
excellent
courtesy
is
so
indeed
yet
again
your
fingers
to
your
lips
would
they
were
for
your
sake
trumpet
within
the
moor
i
know
his
trumpet
cassio
is
truly
so
desdemona
let
meet
him
and
receive
him
cassio
lo
where
he
comes
enter
othello
and
attendants
othello
o
my
fair
warrior
desdemona
my
dear
othello
othello
it
gives
me
wonder
great
as
my
content
to
see
you
here
before
me
o
my
soul
joy
if
after
every
tempest
come
such
calms
may
the
winds
blow
till
they
have
waken
death
and
let
the
laboring
bark
climb
hills
of
seas
and
duck
again
as
low
as
hell
from
heaven
if
it
were
now
to
die
now
to
be
most
happy
for
i
fear
my
soul
hath
her
content
so
absolute
that
not
another
comfort
like
to
this
succeeds
in
unknown
fate
desdemona
the
heavens
forbid
but
that
our
loves
and
comforts
should
increase
even
as
our
days
do
grow
othello
amen
to
that
sweet
powers
i
can
not
speak
enough
of
this
content
it
stops
me
here
it
is
too
much
of
joy
and
this
and
this
the
greatest
discords
be
kisses
her
that
our
hearts
shall
make
iago
aside
o
you
are
well
tuned
now
but
i
set
down
the
pegs
that
make
this
music
as
honest
as
i
am
othello
come
let
us
to
the
castle
news
friends
our
wars
are
done
the
turks
are
drown
how
does
my
old
acquaintance
of
this
isle
honey
you
shall
be
well
desired
in
cyprus
i
have
found
great
love
amongst
them
o
my
sweet
i
prattle
out
of
fashion
and
i
dote
in
mine
own
comforts
i
prithee
good
iago
go
to
the
bay
and
disembark
my
coffers
bring
thou
the
master
to
the
citadel
he
is
a
good
one
and
his
worthiness
does
challenge
much
respect
come
desdemona
once
more
well
met
at
cyprus
exeunt
all
but
iago
and
roderigo
iago
do
thou
meet
me
presently
at
the
harbor
come
hither
if
thou
as
they
say
base
men
being
in
love
have
then
a
nobility
in
their
natures
more
than
is
native
to
list
me
the
lieutenant
tonight
watches
on
the
court
of
guard
first
i
must
tell
thee
this
desdemona
is
directly
in
love
with
him
roderigo
with
him
why
is
not
possible
iago
lay
thy
finger
thus
and
let
thy
soul
be
instructed
mark
me
with
what
violence
she
first
loved
the
moor
but
for
bragging
and
telling
her
fantastical
lies
and
will
she
love
him
still
for
prating
let
not
thy
discreet
heart
think
it
her
eye
must
be
fed
and
what
delight
shall
she
have
to
look
on
the
devil
when
the
blood
is
made
dull
with
the
act
of
sport
there
should
be
again
to
inflame
it
and
to
give
satiety
a
fresh
appetite
loveliness
in
favor
sympathy
in
years
manners
and
all
which
the
moor
is
defective
in
now
for
want
of
these
required
conveniences
her
delicate
tenderness
will
find
itself
abused
begin
to
heave
the
gorge
disrelish
and
abhor
the
moor
very
nature
will
instruct
her
in
it
and
compel
her
to
some
second
choice
now
sir
this
as
it
is
a
most
pregnant
and
unforced
who
stands
so
eminently
in
the
degree
of
this
fortune
as
cassio
does
a
knave
very
voluble
no
further
conscionable
than
in
putting
on
the
mere
form
of
civil
and
humane
seeming
for
the
better
compass
of
his
salt
and
most
hidden
loose
affection
why
none
why
a
slipper
and
subtle
knave
a
finder
out
of
occasions
that
has
an
eye
can
stamp
and
counterfeit
advantages
though
true
advantage
never
present
a
devilish
knave
besides
the
knave
is
handsome
young
and
hath
all
those
requisites
in
him
that
folly
and
green
minds
look
a
pestilent
complete
knave
and
the
woman
hath
found
him
already
roderigo
i
can
not
believe
that
in
her
she
full
of
most
blest
condition
iago
blest
the
wine
she
drinks
is
made
of
grapes
if
she
had
been
blest
she
would
never
have
loved
the
moor
blest
pudding
didst
thou
not
see
her
paddle
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
didst
not
mark
that
roderigo
yes
that
i
did
but
that
was
but
courtesy
iago
lechery
by
this
hand
an
index
and
obscure
prologue
to
the
history
of
lust
and
foul
thoughts
they
met
so
near
with
their
lips
that
their
breaths
embraced
together
villainous
thoughts
roderigo
when
these
mutualities
so
marshal
the
way
hard
at
hand
comes
the
master
and
main
exercise
the
incorporate
conclusion
pish
but
sir
be
you
ruled
by
me
i
have
brought
you
from
venice
watch
you
tonight
for
the
command
i
upon
you
cassio
knows
you
not
i
not
be
far
from
you
do
you
find
some
occasion
to
anger
cassio
either
by
speaking
too
loud
or
tainting
his
discipline
or
from
what
other
course
you
please
which
the
time
shall
more
favorably
minister
roderigo
well
iago
sir
he
is
rash
and
very
sudden
in
choler
and
haply
may
strike
at
you
provoke
him
that
he
may
for
even
out
of
that
will
i
cause
these
of
cyprus
to
mutiny
whose
qualification
shall
come
into
no
true
taste
again
but
by
the
displanting
of
cassio
so
shall
you
have
a
shorter
journey
to
your
desires
by
the
means
i
shall
then
have
to
prefer
them
and
the
impediment
most
profitably
removed
without
the
which
there
were
no
expectation
of
our
prosperity
roderigo
i
will
do
this
if
i
can
bring
it
to
any
opportunity
iago
i
warrant
thee
meet
me
by
and
by
at
the
citadel
i
must
fetch
his
necessaries
ashore
farewell
roderigo
adieu
exit
iago
that
cassio
loves
her
i
do
well
believe
it
that
she
loves
him
is
apt
and
of
great
credit
the
moor
howbeit
that
i
endure
him
not
is
of
a
constant
loving
noble
nature
and
i
dare
think
he
prove
to
desdemona
a
most
dear
husband
now
i
do
love
her
too
not
out
of
absolute
lust
though
peradventure
i
stand
accountant
for
as
great
a
sin
but
partly
led
to
diet
my
revenge
for
that
i
do
suspect
the
lusty
moor
hath
leap
into
my
seat
the
thought
whereof
doth
like
a
poisonous
mineral
gnaw
my
inwards
and
nothing
can
or
shall
content
my
soul
till
i
am
even
with
him
wife
for
wife
or
failing
so
yet
that
i
put
the
moor
at
least
into
a
jealousy
so
strong
that
judgement
can
not
cure
which
thing
to
do
if
this
poor
trash
of
venice
whom
i
trace
for
his
quick
hunting
stand
the
putting
on
i
have
our
michael
cassio
on
the
hip
abuse
him
to
the
moor
in
the
rank
garb
for
i
fear
cassio
with
my
nightcap
too
make
the
moor
thank
me
love
me
and
reward
me
for
making
him
egregiously
an
ass
and
practicing
upon
his
peace
and
quiet

warrant
her
full
of
game
cassio
indeed
she
a
most
fresh
and
delicate
creature
iago
what
an
eye
she
has
methinks
it
sounds
a
parley
to
provocation
cassio
an
inviting
eye
and
yet
methinks
right
modest
iago
and
when
she
speaks
is
it
not
an
alarum
to
love
cassio
she
is
indeed
perfection
iago
well
happiness
to

the
health
of
black
othello
cassio
not

good
iago
i
have
very
poor

our
friends
but
one
cup
i
drink
for
you
cassio
i
have
drunk

one
cup

craftily
qualified

i
am
unfortunate
in
the
infirmity
and
dare
not
task
my
weakness
with
any
more
iago
what

hath
drunk

full
of

and
offense
as

young
mistress

my
sick
fool
roderigo
whom
love
hath
turn
almost
the
wrong
side
out
to
desdemona

caroused
potations
and
he
to
watch
three
lads
of
cyprus
noble
swelling
spirits
that
hold
their
honors
in
a
wary
distance
the
very
elements
of
this
warlike
isle

i
tonight
fluster
with
flowing
cups
and
they
watch
too
now
this
flock
of
drunkards
am
i
to
put
our
cassio
in
some
action
that

he
was
a
wight

high
renown

of
low

the
country
down
then
take
thine
auld
cloak
about
thee
some
wine
ho
cassio
why
this
is
a
more
exquisite
song
than
the
other
iago
will
you
again
cassio
no
for
i
hold
him
to
be
unworthy
of
his
place
that
does
those
things
well
god

all
and
there
be
souls
must
be

there

masters
come
let
set

iago
you
see
this
fellow
that
is
gone
before
he
is
a
soldier
fit
to
stand
by
caesar
and
give
direction
and
do
but
see
his
vice
is
to
his
virtue
a
just
equinox
the
one
as
long
as
the
other
is
pity
of
him
i
fear
the
trust
othello
puts
him
in
on
some
odd
time
of
his
infirmity
will
shake
this
island
montano
but
is
he
often
thus
iago
is
evermore
the
prologue
to
his
sleep

double
set
if
drink
rock
not
his
cradle
montano
it
were
well
the
general
were
put
in
mind
of
it
perhaps
he
sees
it
not
or
his
good
nature
prizes
the
virtue
that
appears
in
cassio
and
looks
not
on
his
evils
is
not
this
true
enter

him
how
now

i
pray

hazard
such
a
place
as
his
own
second
with
one
of
an
ingraft
infirmity
it
were
an
honest
action
to
say
so
to
the
moor

this
fair

matter
masters
honest
iago
that
dead
with
grieving
speak
who
began
this
on
thy
love
i
charge
thee
iago
i
do
not
know
friends
all
but
now
even
now
in
quarter
and
in
terms
like
bride
and
groom
devesting
them
for
bed
and
then
but
now
as
if
some
planet
had
unwitted
men
swords
out
and
tilting
one
at
other
breast
in
opposition
bloody
i
can
not
speak
any
beginning
to
this
peevish
odds
and
would
in
action
glorious
i
had
lost
those
legs
that
brought
me
to
a
part
of
it
othello
how
comes
it
michael
you
are
thus
forgot
cassio
i
pray
you
pardon
me
i
can
not
speak
othello
worthy
montano
you
were
wont
be
civil
the
gravity
and
stillness
of
your
youth
the
world
hath
noted
and
your
name
is
great
in
mouths
of
wisest
censure
what
the
matter
that
you
unlace
your
reputation
thus
and
spend
your
rich
opinion
for
the
name
of
a
give
me
answer
to
it
montano
worthy
othello
i
am
hurt
to
danger
your
officer
iago
can
inform
while
i
spare
speech
which
something
now
offends
of
all
that
i
do
know
nor
know
i
aught
by
me
that
said
or
done
amiss
this
night
unless
be
sometimes
a
vice
and
to
defend
ourselves
it
be
a
sin
when
violence
assails
us
othello
now
by
heaven
my
blood
begins
my
safer
guides
to
rule
and
passion
having
my
best
judgement
collied
assays
to
lead
the
way
if
i
once
stir
or
do
but
lift
this
arm
the
best
of
you
shall
sink
in
my
rebuke
give
me
to
know
how
this
foul
rout
began
who
set
it
on
and
he
that
is
approved
in
this
offense
though
he
had
twinn
with
me
both
at
a
birth
shall
lose
me
what
in
a
town
of
war
yet
wild
the
people
hearts
brimful
of
fear
to
manage
private
and
domestic
quarrel
in
night
and
on
the
court
and
guard
of
safety
is
monstrous
iago
who
bega
montano
if
partially
affined
or
leagued
in
office
thou
dost
deliver
more
or
less
than
truth
thou
art
no
soldier
iago
touch
me
not
so
near
i
had
rather
have
this
tongue
cut
from
my
mouth
than
it
should
do
offense
to
michael
cassio
yet
i
persuade
myself
to
speak
the
truth
shall
nothing
wrong
him
thus
it
is
general
montano
and
myself
being
in
speech
there
comes
a
fellow
crying
out
for
help
and
cassio
following
him
with
determined
sword
to
execute
upon
him
sir
this
gentleman
steps
in
to
cassio
and
entreats
his
pause
myself
the
crying
fellow
did
pursue
lest
by
his
as
it
so
fell
the
town
might
fall
in
fright
he
swift
of
foot
outran
my
purpose
and
i
return
the
rather
for
that
i
heard
the
clink
and
fall
of
swords
and
cassio
high
in
oath
which
till
tonight
i
might
say
before
when
i
came
for
this
was
i
found
them
close
together
at
blow
and
thrust
even
as
again
they
were
when
you
yourself
did
part
them
more
of
this
matter
can
not
i
report
but
men
are
men
the
best
sometimes
forget
though
cassio
did
some
little
wrong
to
him
as
men
in
rage
strike
those
that
wish
them
best
yet
surely
cassio
i
believe
received
from
him
that
fled
some
strange
indignity
which
patience
could
not
pass
othello
i
know
iago
thy
honesty
and
love
doth
mince
this
matter
making
it
light
to
cassio
cassio
i
love
thee
but
never
more
be
officer
of
mine
desdemona
attended
look
if
my
gentle
love
be
not
raised
up
i
make
thee
an
example
desdemona
what
the
matter
othello
all
well
now
sweeting
come
away
to
bed
sir
for
your
hurts
myself
will
be
your
surgeon
lead
him
off
exit
montano
attended
iago
look
with
care
about
the
town
and
silence
those
whom
this
vile
brawl
distracted
come
desdemona
is
the
soldiers
life

have
their
balmy
slumbers
waked
with
strife
exeunt
all
but
iago
and
cassio
iago
what
are
you
hurt
lieutenant
cassio
ay
past
all
surgery
iago
marry

forbid
cassio
reputation
reputation
reputation
o
i
have
lost
my
reputation
i
have
lost
the
immortal
part
of
myself
and
what
remains
is
bestial
my
reputation
iago
my
reputation
iago
as
i
am
an
honest
man
i
thought
you
had
received
some
bodily
wound
there
is
more
sense
in
that
than
in
reputation
reputation
is
an
idle
and
most
false
imposition
oft
got
without
merit
and
lost
without
deserving
you
have
lost
no
reputation
at
all
unless
you
repute
yourself
such
a
loser
what
man
there
are
ways
to
recover
the
general
again
you
are
but
now
cast
in
his
mood
a
punishment
more
in
policy
than
in
malice
even
so
as
one
would
beat
his
offenseless
dog
to
affright
an
imperious
lion
sue
to
him
again
and
he
yours
cassio
i
will
rather
sue
to
be
despised
than
to
deceive
so
good
a
commander
with
so
slight
so
drunken
and
so
indiscreet
an
officer
drunk
and
speak
parrot
and
squabble
swagger
swear
and
discourse
fustian
with
one
own
shadow
o
thou
invisible
spirit
of
wine
if
thou
hast
no
name
to
be
known
by
let
us
call
thee
devil
iago
what
was
he
that
you
followed
with
your
sword
what
had
he
done
to
you
cassio
i
know
not
iago
possible
cassio
i
remember
a
mass
of
things
but
nothing
distinctly
a
quarrel
but
nothing
wherefore
o
god
that
men
should
put
an
enemy
in
their
mouths
to
steal
away
their
brains
that
we
should
with
joy
pleasance
revel
and
applause
transform
ourselves
into
beasts
iago
why
but
you
are
now
well
enough
how
came
you
thus
recovered
cassio
it
hath
pleased
the
devil
drunkenness
to
give
place
to
the
devil
wrath
one
unperfectness
shows
me
another
to
make
me
frankly
despise
myself
iago
come
you
are
too
severe
a
moraler
as
the
time
the
place
and
the
condition
of
this
country
stands
i
could
heartily
wish
this
had
not
befallen
but
since
it
is
as
it
is
mend
it
for
your
own
good
cassio
i
will
ask
him
for
my
place
again
he
shall
tell
me
i
am
a
drunkard
had
i
as
many
mouths
as
hydra
such
an
answer
would
stop
them
all
to
be
now
a
sensible
man
by
and
by
a
fool
and
presently
a
beast
o
strange
every
inordinate
cup
is
unblest
and
the
ingredient
is
a
devil
iago
come
come
good
wine
is
a
good
familiar
creature
if
it
be
well
used
exclaim
no
more
against
it
and
good
lieutenant
i
think
you
think
i
love
you
cassio
i
have
well
approved
it
sir
i
drunk
iago
you
or
any
man
living
may
be
drunk
at
some
time
man
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
our
general
wife
is
now
the
general
i
may
say
so
in
this
respect
for
that
he
hath
devoted
and
given
up
himself
to
the
contemplation
mark
and
denotement
of
her
parts
and
graces
confess
yourself
freely
to
her
importune
her
help
to
put
you
in
your
place
again
she
is
of
so
free
so
kind
so
apt
so
blessed
a
disposition
she
holds
it
a
vice
in
her
goodness
not
to
do
more
than
she
is
requested
this
broken
joint
between
you
and
her
husband
entreat
her
to
splinter
and
my
fortunes
against
any
lay
worth
naming
this
crack
of
your
love
shall
grow
stronger
than
it
was
before
cassio
you
advise
me
well
iago
i
protest
in
the
sincerity
of
love
and
honest
kindness
cassio
i
think
it
freely
and
betimes
in
the
morning
i
will
beseech
the
virtuous
desdemona
to
undertake
for
me
i
am
desperate
of
my
fortunes
if
they
check
me
here
iago
you
are
in
the
right
good
night
lieutenant
i
must
to
the
watch
cassio
good
night
honest
iago
exit
iago
and
what
he
then
that
says
i
play
the
villain
when
this
advice
is
free
i
give
and
honest
probal
to
thinking
and
indeed
the
course
to
win
the
moor
again
for
is
most
easy
the
inclining
desdemona
to
subdue
in
any
honest
suit
she
framed
as
fruitful
as
the
free
elements
and
then
for
her
to
win
the
moor
to
renounce
his
baptism
all
seals
and
symbols
of
redeemed
sin
his
soul
is
so
enfetter
to
her
love
that
she
may
make
unmake
do
what
she
list
even
as
her
appetite
shall
play
the
god
with
his
weak
function
how
am
i
then
a
villain
to
counsel
cassio
to
this
parallel
course
directly
to
his
good
divinity
of
hell
when
devils
will
the
blackest
sins
put
on
they
do
suggest
at
first
with
heavenly
shows
as
i
do
now
for
whiles
this
honest
fool
plies
desdemona
to
repair
his
fortune
and
she
for
him
pleads
strongly
to
the
moor
i
pour
this
pestilence
into
his
ear
that
she
repeals
him
for
her
body
lust
and
by
how
much
she
strives
to
do
him
good
she
shall
undo
her
credit
with
the
moor
so
will
i
turn
her
virtue
into
pitch
and
out
of
her
own
goodness
make
the
net
that
shall
enmesh
them
all
enter
roderigo
how
now
roderigo
roderigo
i
do
follow
here
in
the
chase
not
like
a
hound
that
hunts
but
one
that
fills
up
the
cry
my
money
is
almost
spent
i
have
been
tonight
exceedingly
well
cudgeled
and
i
think
the
issue
will
be
i
shall
have
so
much
experience
for
my
pains
and
so
with
no
money
at
all
and
a
little
more
wit
return
again

poor
are
they
that
have
not
patience
what
wound
did
ever

by
degrees

not
by

to

for
i
know
full
of
love
and
honesty
and
thy
words
before
thou
givest
them
breath
therefore
these
stops
of
thine
fright
me
the
more
for
such
things
in
a
false
disloyal
knave
are
tricks
of
custom
but
in
a
man
that
just
they
close
dilations
working
from
the
heart
that
passion
can
not
rule
iago
for
michael
cassio
i
dare
be
sworn
i
think
that
he
is
honest
othello
i
think
so
too
iago
men
should
be
what
they
seem
or
those
that
be
not
would
they
might
seem
none
othello
certain
men
should
be
what
they
seem
iago
why
then
i
think
cassio
an
honest
man
othello
nay
yet
there
more
in
this
i
prithee
speak
to
me
as
to
thy
thinkings
as
thou
dost
ruminate
and
give
thy
worst
of
thoughts
the
worst
of
words
iago
good
my
lord
pardon
me
though
i
am
bound
to
every
act
of
duty
i
am
not
bound
to
that
all
slaves
are
free
to
utter
my
thoughts
why
say
they
are
vile
and
false
as
where
that
palace
whereinto
foul
things
sometimes
intrude
not
who
has
a
breast
so
pure
but
some
uncleanly
apprehensions
keep
leets
and
and
in
session
sit
with
meditations
lawful
othello
thou
dost
conspire
against
thy
friend
iago
if
thou
but
him
wrong
and
makest
his
ear
a
stranger
to
thy
thoughts
iago
i
do
beseech
though
i
perchance
am
vicious
in
my
guess
as
i
confess
it
is
my
nature
plague
to
spy
into
abuses
and
oft
my
jealousy
shapes
faults
that
are
that
your
wisdom
yet
from
one
that
so
imperfectly
conceits
would
take
no
notice
nor
build
yourself
a
trouble
out
of
his
scattering
and
unsure
observance
it
were
not
for
your
quiet
nor
your
good
nor
for
my
manhood
honesty
or
wisdom
to
let
you
know
my
thoughts
othello
what
dost
thou
mean
iago
good
name
in
man
and
woman
dear
my
lord
is
the
immediate
jewel
of
their
souls
who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash
is
something
nothing
was
mine
is
his
and
has
been
slave
to
thousands
but
he
that
filches
from
me
my
good
name
robs
me
of
that
which
not
enriches
him
and
makes
me
poor
indeed
othello
by
heaven
i
know
thy
thoughts
iago
you
can
not
if
my
heart
were
in
your
hand
nor
shall
not
whilst
is
in
my
custody
othello
ha
iago
o
beware
my
lord
of
jealousy
it
is
the
monster
which
doth
mock
the
meat
it
feeds
on
that
cuckold
lives
in
bliss
who
certain
of
his
fate
loves
not
his
wronger
but
o
what
damned
minutes
tells
he
who
dotes
yet
doubts
suspects
yet
strongly
loves
othello
o
misery
iago
poor
and
content
is
rich
and
rich
enough
but
riches
fineless
is
as
poor
as
winter
to
him
that
ever
fears
he
shall
be
poor
good
heaven
the
souls
of
all
my
tribe
defend
from
jealousy
othello
why
why
is
this
thou
make
a
life
of
jealousy
to
follow
still
the
changes
of
the
moon
with
fresh
suspicions
no
to
be
once
in
doubt
is
once
to
be
resolved
exchange
me
for
a
goat
when
i
shall
turn
the
business
of
my
soul
to
such
exsufflicate
and
blown
surmises
matching
thy
inference
is
not
to
make
me
jealous
to
say
my
wife
is
fair
feeds
well
loves
company
is
free
of
speech
sings
plays
and
dances
well
where
virtue
is
these
are
more
virtuous
nor
from
mine
own
weak
merits
will
i
draw
the
smallest
fear
or
doubt
of
her
revolt
for
she
had
eyes
and
chose
me
no
iago
i
see
before
i
doubt
when
i
doubt
prove
and
on
the
proof
there
is
no
more
but
away
at
once
with
love
or
jealousy
iago
i
am
glad
of
it
for
now
i
shall
have
reason
to
show
the
love
and
duty
that
i
bear
you
with
franker
spirit
therefore
as
i
am
bound
receive
it
from
me
i
speak
not
yet
of
proof
look
to
your
wife
observe
her
well
with
cassio
wear
your
eye
thus
not
jealous
nor
secure
i
would
not
have
your
free
and
noble
nature
out
of
be
abused
look
i
know
our
country
disposition
well
in
venice
they
do
let
heaven
see
the
pranks
they
dare
not
show
their
husbands
their
best
conscience
is
not
to
undone
but
unknown
othello
dost
thou
say
so
iago
she
did
deceive
her
father
marrying
you
and
when
she
seem
to
shake
and
fear
your
looks
she
loved
them
most
othello
and
so
she
did
iago
why
go
to
then
she
that
so
young
could
give
out
such
a
seeming
to
seel
her
father
eyes
up
close
as
he
thought
was
but
i
am
much
to
blame
i
humbly
do
beseech
you
of
your
pardon
for
too
much
loving
you
othello
i
am
bound
to
thee
forever
iago
i
see
this
hath
a
little
dash
your
spirits
othello
not
a
jot
not
a
jot
iago
i
fear
it
has
i
hope
you
will
consider
what
is
spoke
comes
from
my
love
but
i
do
see
you
moved
i
am
to
pray
you
not
to
strain
my
speech
to
grosser
issues
nor
to
larger
reach
than
to
suspicion
othello
i
will
not
iago
should
you
do
so
my
lord
my
speech
should
fall
into
such
vile
success
which
my
thoughts
aim
not
at
cassio
my
worthy
my
lord
i
see
you
moved
othello
no
not
much
moved
i
do
not
think
but
desdemona
honest
iago
long
live
she
so
and
long
live
you
to
think
so
othello
and
yet
how
nature
erring
from
iago
ay
there
the
point
to
be
bold
with
not
to
affect
many
proposed
matches
of
her
own
clime
complexion
and
degree
whereto
we
see
in
all
things
nature
foh
one
may
smell
in
such
a
will
most
rank
foul
disproportion
thoughts
unnatural
but
pardon
me
i
do
not
in
position
distinctly
speak
of
her
though
i
may
fear
her
will
recoiling
to
her
better
judgement
may
fall
to
match
you
with
her
country
forms
and
happily
repent
othello
farewell
farewell
if
more
thou
dost
perceive
let
me
know
more
set
on
thy
wife
to
observe
leave
me
iago
iago
going
my
lord
i
take
my
leave
othello
why
did
i
marry
this
honest
creature
doubtless
sees
and
knows
more
much
more
than
he
unfolds
iago
returning
my
lord
i
would
i
might
entreat
your
honor
to
scan
this
thing
no
further
leave
it
to
time
though
it
be
fit
that
cassio
have
his
place
for
sure
he
fills
it
up
with
great
ability
yet
if
you
please
to
hold
him
off
awhile
you
shall
by
that
perceive
him
and
his
means
note
if
your
lady
strain
his
entertainment
with
any
strong
or
vehement
importunity
much
will
be
seen
in
that
in
the
meantime
let
me
be
thought
too
busy
in
my
as
worthy
cause
i
have
to
fear
i
and
hold
her
free
i
do
beseech
your
honor
othello
fear
not
my
government
iago
i
once
more
take
my
leave
exit
othello
this
fellow
of
exceeding
honesty
and
knows
all
qualities
with
a
learned
spirit
of
human
dealings
if
i
do
prove
her
haggard
though
that
her
jesses
were
my
dear
heartstrings
whistle
her
off
and
let
her
down
the
wind
to
prey
at
fortune
haply
for
i
am
black
and
have
not
those
soft
parts
of
conversation
that
chamberers
have
or
for
i
am
declined
into
the
vale
of
yet
that
not
she
gone
i
am
abused
and
my
relief
must
be
to
loathe
her
o
curse
of
marriage
that
we
can
call
these
delicate
creatures
ours
and
not
their
appetites
i
had
rather
be
a
toad
and
live
upon
the
vapor
of
a
dungeon
than
keep
a
corner
in
the
thing
i
love
for
others
uses
yet
is
the
plague
of
great
ones
prerogatived
are
they
less
than
the
base
is
destiny
unshunnable
like
death
even
then
this
forked
plague
is
fated
to
us
when
we
do
quicken
desdemona
comes
desdemona
and
emilia
if
she
be
false
o
then
heaven
mocks
itself
i
not
desdemona
how
now
my
dear
othello
your
dinner
and
the
generous
islanders
by
you
invited
do
attend
your
presence
othello
i
am
to
blame
desdemona
why
do
you
speak
so
faintly
are
you
not
well
othello
i
have
a
pain
upon
my
forehead
here
desdemona
faith
that
with
watching
away
again
let
me
but
bind
it
hard
within
this
hour
it
will
be
well
othello
your
napkin
is
too
little
he
puts
the
handkerchief
from
him
and
she
drops
it
let
it
alone
come
i
go
in
with
you
desdemona
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
are
not
well
exeunt
othello
and
desdemona
emilia
i
am
glad
i
have
found
this
napkin
this
was
her
first
remembrance
from
the
moor
my
wayward
husband
hath
a
hundred
times
woo
me
to
steal
it
but
she
so
loves
the
token
for
he
conjured
her
she
should
ever
keep
it
that
she
reserves
it
evermore
about
her
to
kiss
and
talk
to
i
have
the
work
out
and
iago
what
he
will
do
with
it
heaven
knows
not
i
i
nothing
but
to
please
his
fantasy
iago
iago
how
now
what
do
you
here
alone
emilia
do
not
you
chide
i
have
a
thing
for
you
iago
a
thing
for
me
it
is
a
common
emilia
ha
iago
to
have
a
foolish
wife
emilia
o
is
that
all
what
will
you
give
me
now
for
that
same
handkerchief
iago
what
handkerchief
emilia
what
handkerchief
why
that
the
moor
first
gave
to
desdemona
that
which
so
often
you
did
bid
me
steal
iago
hast
it
from
her
emilia
no
faith
she
let
it
drop
by
negligence
and
to
the
advantage
i
being
here
up
look
here
it
is
iago
a
good
wench
give
it
me
emilia
what
will
you
do
that
you
have
been
so
earnest
to
have
me
filch
it
iago
snatching
it
why
what
is
that
to
you
emilia
be
not
for
some
purpose
of
import
me
again
poor
lady
she
run
mad
when
she
shall
lack
it
iago
be
not
acknown
o
i
have
use
for
it
go
leave
me
exit
emilia
i
will
in
cassio
lodging
lose
this
napkin
and
let
him
find
it
trifles
light
as
air
are
to
the
jealous
confirmations
strong
as
proofs
of
holy
writ
this
may
do
something
the
moor
already
changes
with
my
poison
dangerous
conceits
are
in
their
natures
poisons
which
at
the
first
are
scarce
found
to
distaste
but
with
a
little
act
upon
the
blood
burn
like
the
mines
of
sulphur
i
did
say
so
look
where
he
comes
othello
not
poppy
nor
mandragora
nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
shall
ever
medicine
thee
to
that
sweet
sleep
which
thou
owedst
yesterday
othello
ha
ha
false
to
me
iago
why
how
now
general
no
more
of
that
othello
avaunt
be
gone
thou
hast
set
me
on
the
rack
i
swear
is
better
to
be
much
abused
than
but
to
a
little
iago
how
now
my
lord
othello
what
sense
had
i
of
her
hours
of
lust
i
not
thought
it
not
it
harm
not
me
i
slept
the
next
night
well
was
free
and
merry
i
found
not
cassio
kisses
on
her
lips
he
that
is
robb
not
wanting
what
is
let
him
not
and
he
not
robb
at
all
iago
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
othello
i
had
been
happy
if
the
general
camp
pioners
and
all
had
tasted
her
sweet
body
so
i
had
nothing
known
o
now
forever
farewell
the
tranquil
mind
farewell
content
farewell
the
plumed
troop
and
the
big
wars
that
make
ambition
virtue
o
farewell
farewell
the
neighing
steed
and
the
shrill
trump
the
drum
the
fife
the
royal
banner
and
all
quality
pride
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
and
o
you
mortal
engines
whose
rude
throats
the
immortal
jove
dread
clamors
counterfeit
farewell
othello
occupation
gone
iago
possible
my
lord
othello
villain
be
sure
thou
prove
my
love
a
whore
be
sure
of
it
give
me
the
ocular
proof
or
by
the
worth
of
man
eternal
soul
thou
hadst
been
better
have
been
born
a
dog
than
answer
my
waked
wrath
iago
come
to
this
othello
make
me
to
or
at
the
least
so
prove
it
that
the
probation
bear
no
hinge
nor
loop
to
hang
a
doubt
on
or
woe
upon
thy
life
iago
my
noble
othello
if
thou
dost
slander
her
and
torture
me
never
pray
more
abandon
all
remorse
on
horror
head
horrors
accumulate
do
deeds
to
make
heaven
weep
all
earth
amazed
for
nothing
canst
thou
to
damnation
add
greater
than
that
iago
o
grace
o
heaven
defend
me
are
you
a
man
have
you
a
soul
or
sense
god
be
wi
you
take
mine
office
o
wretched
fool
that
livest
to
make
thine
honesty
a
vice
o
monstrous
world
take
note
take
note
o
world
to
be
direct
and
honest
is
not
safe
i
thank
you
for
this
profit
and
from
hence
i
love
no
friend
sith
love
breeds
such
offense
othello
nay
stay
thou
shouldst
be
honest
iago
i
should
be
wise
for
honesty
a
fool
and
loses
that
it
works
for
othello
by
the
world
i
think
my
wife
be
honest
and
think
she
is
not
i
think
that
thou
art
just
and
think
thou
art
not
i
have
some
proof
her
name
that
was
as
fresh
as
dian
visage
is
now
begrimed
and
black
as
mine
own
face
if
there
be
cords
or
knives
poison
or
fire
or
suffocating
streams
i
not
endure
it
would
i
were
satisfied
iago
i
see
sir
you
are
eaten
up
with
passion
i
do
repent
me
that
i
put
it
to
you
you
would
be
satisfied
othello
would
nay
i
will
iago
and
may
but
how
how
satisfied
my
lord
would
you
the
supervisor
grossly
gape
on
behold
her
topp
othello
death
and
damnation
o
iago
it
were
a
tedious
difficulty
i
think
to
bring
them
to
that
prospect
damn
them
then
if
ever
mortal
eyes
do
see
them
bolster
more
than
their
own
what
then
how
then
what
shall
i
say
where
satisfaction
it
is
impossible
you
should
see
this
were
they
as
prime
as
goats
as
hot
as
monkeys
as
salt
as
wolves
in
pride
and
fools
as
gross
as
ignorance
made
drunk
but
yet
i
say
if
imputation
and
strong
circumstances
which
lead
directly
to
the
door
of
truth
will
give
you
satisfaction
you
may
othello
give
me
a
living
reason
she
disloyal
iago
i
do
not
like
the
office
but
sith
i
am
enter
in
this
cause
so
far
prick
by
foolish
honesty
and
love
i
will
go
on
i
lay
with
cassio
lately
and
being
troubled
with
a
raging
tooth
i
could
not
sleep
there
are
a
kind
of
men
so
loose
of
soul
that
in
their
sleeps
will
mutter
their
affairs
one
of
this
kind
is
cassio
in
sleep
i
heard
him
say
sweet
desdemona
let
us
be
wary
let
us
hide
our
loves
and
then
sir
would
he
gripe
and
wring
my
hand
cry
o
sweet
creature
and
then
kiss
me
hard
as
if
he
pluck
up
kisses
by
the
roots
that
grew
upon
my
lips
then
laid
his
leg
over
my
thigh
and
sigh
and
kiss
and
then
cried
cursed
fate
that
gave
thee
to
the
moor
othello
o
monstrous
monstrous
iago
nay
this
was
but
his
dream
othello
but
this
denoted
a
foregone
conclusion
is
a
shrewd
doubt
though
it
be
but
a
dream
iago
and
this
may
help
to
thicken
other
proofs
that
do
demonstrate
thinly
othello
i
tear
her
all
to
pieces
iago
nay
but
be
wise
yet
we
see
nothing
done
she
may
be
honest
yet
tell
me
but
this
have
you
not
sometimes
seen
a
handkerchief
spotted
with
strawberries
in
your
wife
hand
othello
i
gave
her
such
a
one

against

with
the
other
proofs

icy
current
and
compulsive
course
feels
retiring
ebb
but
keeps
due
on
to
the
propontic
and
the
hellespont
even
so
my
bloody
thoughts
with
violent
pace

look
back

to
humble
love
till

lost
my
purse
full
of
crusadoes
and
but
my
noble
moor
is
true
of
mind
and
made
of
no
such
baseness
as
jealous
creatures
are
it
were
enough
to
put
him
to
ill
thinking
emilia
is
he
not
jealous
desdemona
who
he
i
think
the
sun
where
he
was
born
drew
all
such
humors
from

o
hardness

dissemble
how
do
you
desdemona
desdemona
well
my
good
lord
othello
give
me
your
hand
this
hand
is
moist
my
lady
desdemona
it
yet
has
felt
no
age
nor
known
no
sorrow
othello
this
argues
fruitfulness
and
liberal
heart
hot
hot
and
moist
this
hand
of
yours
requires
a
sequester
from
liberty
fasting
and
prayer
much
castigation
exercise
devout
for
here
a
young
and
sweating
devil
here
that
commonly
rebels
is
a
good
hand
a
frank
one
desdemona
you
may
indeed
say
so
for
was
that
hand
that
gave
away
my
heart
othello
a
liberal
hand
the
hearts
of
old
gave
hands
but
our
new
heraldry
is
hands
not
hearts
desdemona
i
can
not
speak
of
this
come
now
your
promise
othello
what
promise
chuck
desdemona
i
have
sent
to
bid
cassio
come
speak
with
you
othello
i
have
a
salt
and
sorry
rheum
offends
me
lend
me
thy
handkerchief
desdemona
here
my
lord
othello
that
which
i
gave
you
desdemona
i
have
it
not
about
me
othello
not
desdemona
no
faith
my
lord
othello
that
a
fault
that
handkerchief
did
an
egyptian
to
my
mother
give
she
was
a
charmer
and
could
almost
read
the
thoughts
of
people
she
told
her
while
she
kept
it
make
her
amiable
and
subdue
my
father
entirely
to
her
love
but
if
she
lost
it
or
made
a
gift
of
it
my
father
eye
should
hold
her
loathed
and
his
spirits
should
hunt
after
new
fancies
she
dying
gave
it
me
and
bid
me
when
my
fate
would
have
me
wive
to
give
it
her
i
did
so
and
take
heed
o
make
it
a
darling
like
your
precious
eye
to
or
away
were
such
perdition
as
nothing
else
could
match
desdemona
possible
othello
is
true
there
magic
in
the
web
of
it
a
sibyl
that
had
number
in
the
world
the
sun
to
course
two
hundred
compasses
in
her
prophetic
fury
sew
the
work
the
worms
were
hallow
that
did
breed
the
silk
and
it
was
dyed
in
mummy
which
the
skillful
conserved
of
maiden
hearts
desdemona

some
wonder
in
this
handkerchief
i
am
most
unhappy
in
the
loss
of
it
emilia
is
not
a
year
or
two
shows
us
a
man
they
are
all
but
stomachs
and
we
all
but
food
they
eat
us
hungerly
and
when
they
are
full
they
belch
us
look
you
cassio
and
my
husband
enter
cassio
and
iago
iago
there
is
no
other
way
is
she
must
and
lo
the
happiness
go
and
importune
her
desdemona
how
now
good
cassio
what
the
news
with
you
cassio
madam
my
former
suit
i
do
beseech
you
that
by
your
virtuous
means
i
may
again
exist
and
be
a
member
of
his
love
whom
i
with
all
the
office
of
my
heart
entirely
honor
i
would
not
be
delay
if
my
offense
be
of
such
mortal
kind
that
nor
my
service
past
nor
present
sorrows
nor
purposed
merit
in
futurity
can
ransom
me
into
his
love
again
but
to
know
so
must
be
my
benefit
so
shall
i
clothe
me
in
a
forced
content
and
shut
myself
up
in
some
other
course
to
fortune
alms
desdemona
alas
cassio
my
advocation
is
not
now
in
tune
my
lord
is
not
my
lord
nor
should
i
know
him
were
he
in
favor
as
in
humor
alter
so
help
me
every
spirit
sanctified
as
i
have
spoken
for
you
all
my
best
and
stood
within
the
blank
of
his
displeasure
for
my
free
speech
you
must
awhile
be
patient
what
i
can
do
i
will
and
more
i
will
than
for
myself
i
dare
let
that
suffice
you
iago
is
my
lord
angry
emilia
he
went
hence
but
now
and
certainly
in
strange
unquietness
iago
can
he
be
angry
i
have
seen
the
cannon
when
it
hath
blown
his
ranks
into
the
air
and
like
the
devil
from
his
very
arm
puff
his
own
brother
and
can
he
be
angry
something
of
moment
then
i
will
go
meet
him
there
matter
i
indeed
if
he
be
angry
desdemona
i
prithee
do
so
exit
iago
something
sure
of
state
either
from
venice
or
some
unhatch
practice
made
demonstrable
here
in
cyprus
to
him
hath
puddled
his
clear
spirit
and
in
such
cases
men
natures
wrangle
with
inferior
things
though
great
ones
are
their
object
is
even
so
for
let
our
finger
ache
and
it
indues
our
other
healthful
members
even
to
that
sense
of
pain
nay
we
must
think
men
are
not
gods
nor
of
them
look
for
such
observancy
as
fits
the
bridal
beshrew
me
much
emilia
i
was
unhandsome
warrior
as
i
am
arraigning
his
unkindness
with
my
soul
but
now
i
find
i
had
suborn
the
witness
and
he
indicted
falsely
emilia
pray
heaven
it
be
state
matters
as
you
think
and
no
conception
nor
no
jealous
toy
concerning
you
desdemona
alas
the
day
i
never
gave
him
cause
emilia
but
jealous
souls
will
not
be
answer
so
they
are
not
ever
jealous
for
the
cause
but
jealous
for
they
are
jealous
is
a
monster
begot
upon
itself
born
on

that
monster
from
othello

iv
scene
cyprus
before
the
castle
enter
othello
and
iago
iago
will
you
think
so
othello
think
so
iago
iago
what
to
kiss
in
private
othello
an
unauthorized
kiss
iago
or
to
be
naked
with
her
friend
in
bed
an
hour
or
more
not
meaning
any
harm
othello
naked
in
bed
iago
and
not
mean
harm
it
is
hypocrisy
against
the
devil
they
that
mean
virtuously
and
yet
do
so
the
devil
their
virtue
tempts
and
they
tempt
heaven
iago
so
they
do
nothing
is
a
venial
slip
but
if
i
give
my
wife
a
othello
what
then
iago
why
then
is
hers
my
lord
and
being
hers
she
may
i
think
on
any
man
othello
she
is
protectress
of
her
honor
too
may
she
give
that
iago
her
honor
is
an
essence
that
not
seen
they
have
it
very
oft
that
have
it
not
but
for
the
othello
by
heaven
i
would
most
gladly
have
forgot
it
thou
o
it
comes
my
memory
as
doth
the
raven
the
infected
house
boding
to
he
had
my
handkerchief
iago
ay
what
of
that
othello
that
not
so
good
now
iago
what
if
i
had
said
i
had
seen
him
do
you
wrong
or
heard
him
as
knaves
be
such
abroad
who
having
by
their
own
importunate
suit
or
voluntary
dotage
of
some
mistress
convinced
or
supplied
them
can
not
choose
but
they
must
othello
hath
he
said
anything
iago
he
hath
my
lord
but
be
you
well
assured
no
more
than
he
unswear
othello
what
hath
he
said
iago
faith
that
he
i
know
not
what
he
did
othello
what
what
iago
othello
with
her
iago
with
her
on
her
what
you
will
othello
lie
with
her
lie
on
her
we
say
lie
on
her
when
they
belie
her
lie
with
her
that
fulsome
handkerchief
to
confess
and
be
hanged
for
his
first
to
be
hanged
and
then
to
confess
i
tremble
at
it
nature
would
not
invest
herself
in
such
shadowing
passion
without
some
instruction
it
is
not
words
that
shakes
me
thus
pish
noses
ears
and
lips
possible
confess
handkerchief
o
devil
falls
in
a
trance
iago
work
on
my
medicine
work
thus
credulous
fools
are
caught
and
many
worthy
and
chaste
dames
even
thus
all
guiltless
meet
reproach
what
ho
my
lord
my
lord
i
say
othello
enter
cassio
how
now
cassio
cassio
what
the
matter
iago
my
lord
is
into
an
epilepsy
this
is
his
second
fit
he
had
one
yesterday
cassio
rub
him
about
the
temples
iago
no
forbear
the
lethargy
must
have
his
quiet
course
if
not
he
foams
at
mouth
and
by
and
by
breaks
out
to
savage
madness
look
he
stirs
do
you
withdraw
yourself
a
little
while
he
will
recover
straight
when
he
is
gone
i
would
on
great
occasion
speak
with
you
exit
cassio
how
is
it
general
have
you
not
hurt
your
head
othello
dost
thou
mock
me
iago
i
mock
you
no
by
heaven
would
you
would
bear
your
fortune
like
a
man
othello
a
horned
man
a
monster
and
a
beast
iago
there
many
a
beast
then
in
a
populous
city
and
many
a
civil
monster
othello
did
he
confess
it
iago
good
sir
be
a
man
think
every
bearded
fellow
that
but
yoked
may
draw
with
you
there
millions
now
alive
that
nightly
lie
in
those
unproper
beds
which
they
dare
swear
peculiar
your
case
is
better
o
is
the
spite
of
hell
the
fiend
to
lip
a
wanton
in
a
secure
couch
and
to
suppose
her
chaste
no
let
me
know
and
knowing
what
i
am
i
know
what
she
shall
be
othello
o
thou
art
wise
is
certain
iago
stand
you
awhile
apart
confine
yourself
but
in
a
patient
list
whilst
you
were
here
with
your
a
passion
most
unsuiting
such
a
cassio
came
hither
i
shifted
him
away
and
laid
good
upon
your
ecstasy
bade
him
anon
return
and
here
speak
with
me
the
which
he
promised
do
but
encave
yourself
and
mark
the
fleers
the
gibes
and
notable
scorns
that
dwell
in
every
region
of
his
face
for
i
will
make
him
tell
the
tale
anew
where
how
how
oft
how
long
ago
and
when
he
hath
and
is
again
to
cope
your
wife
i
say
but
mark
his
gesture
marry
patience
or
i
shall
say
you
are
all
in
all
in
spleen
and
nothing
of
a
man
othello
dost
thou
hear
iago
i
will
be
found
most
cunning
in
my
patience
but
dost
thou
hear
most
bloody
iago
that
not
amiss
but
yet
keep
time
in
all
will
you
withdraw
othello
retires
now
will
i
question
cassio
of
bianca
a
housewife
that
by
selling
her
desires
buys
herself
bread
and
clothes
it
is
a
creature
that
dotes
on
cassio
as
is
the
strumpet
plague
to
beguile
many
and
be
beguiled
by
one
he
when
he
hears
of
her
can
not
refrain
from
the
excess
of
laughter
here
he
comes
cassio
as
he
shall
smile
othello
shall
go
mad
and
his
unbookish
jealousy
must
construe
poor
cassio
smiles
gestures
and
light
behavior
quite
in
the
wrong
how
do
you
now
lieutenant
cassio
the
worser
that
you
give
me
the
addition
whose
want
even
kills
me
iago
ply
desdemona
well
and
you
are
sure
o
now
if
this
suit
lay
in
bianco
power
how
quickly
should
you
speed
cassio

he
laughs
already
iago
i
never
knew
a
woman
love
man
so
cassio
alas
poor
rogue

loves
me
othello

denies
it
faintly
and
laughs
it
out

importunes
him
to
tell

i
kneel
if

did
trespass
his

either
in

actual
deed
or
that
mine
eyes
mine
ears
or
any

delighted
them
in
any

or
that
i

divorcement
love

forswear
me
unkindness
may
do

and
his
unkindness
may
defeat
my

but
never
taint
my
love
i
can
not
say
whore
it
doth
abhor
me
now
i
speak
the

to
do
the
act
that
might
the
addition
earn
not
the
world
mass
of
vanity
could
make
me
iago
i
pray
you
be
content
is
but
his
humor
the
business
of
the
state
does
him
offense
and
he
does
chide
with
you
desdemona
if
no
iago
is
but
so
i
warrant
trumpets
within
hark
how
these
instruments
summon
to
supper
the
messengers
of
venice
stay
the
meat
go
in
and
weep
not
all

shall
be
well
exeunt
desdemona

emilia
enter
roderigo
how
now
roderigo
roderigo
i
do
not
find
that
thou
dealest
justly
with
me
iago
what
in
the
contrary
roderigo
every
day
thou
daffest
me
with
some
device
iago
and
rather
as
it
seems
to
me
now
keepest
from
me
all
conveniency
than
suppliest
me
with
the
least
advantage
of
hope
i
will
indeed
no
longer
endure
it
nor
am
i
yet
persuaded
to
put
up
in
peace
what
already
i
have
foolishly
suffered
iago
will
you
hear
me
roderigo
roderigo
faith
i
have
heard
too
much
for
your
words
and
performances
are
no
kin
together
iago
you
charge
me
most
unjustly
roderigo
with
nought
but
truth
i
have
wasted
myself
out
of
my
means
the
jewels
you
have
had
from
me
to
deliver
to
desdemona
would
half
have
corrupted
a
votarist
you
have
told
me
she
hath
received
them
and
returned
me
expectations
and
comforts
of
sudden
respect
and
acquaintance
but
i
find
none
iago
well
go
to
very
well
roderigo
very
well
go
to
i
can
not
go
to
man
nor
is
not
very
well
by
this
hand
i
say
is
very
scurvy
and
begin
to
find
myself
fopped
in
it
iago
very
well
roderigo
i
tell
you
is
not
very
well
i
will
make
myself
known
to
desdemona
if
she
will
return
me
my
jewels
i
will
give
over
my
suit
and
repent
my
unlawful
solicitation
if
not
assure
yourself
i
will
seek
satisfaction
of
you
iago
you
have
said
now
roderigo
ay
and
said
nothing
but
what
i
protest
intendment
of
doing
iago
why
now
i
see
there
mettle
in
thee
and
even
from
this
instant
do
build
on
thee
a
better
opinion
than
ever
before
give
me
thy
hand
roderigo
thou
hast
taken
against
me
a
most
just
exception
but
yet
i
protest
have
dealt
most
directly
in
thy
affair
roderigo
it
hath
not
appeared
iago
i
grant
indeed
it
hath
not
appeared
and
your
suspicion
is
not
without
wit
and
judgement
but
roderigo
if
thou
hast
that
in
thee
indeed
which
i
have
greater
reason
to
believe
now
than
ever
i
mean
purpose
courage
and
valor
this
night
show
it
if
thou
the
next
night
following
enjoy
not
desdemona
take
me
from
this
world
with
treachery
and
devise
engines
for
my
life
roderigo
well
what
is
it
is
it
within
reason
and
compass
iago
sir
there
is
especial
commission
come
from
venice
to
depute
cassio

roderigo
is
that
true
why
then
othello

desdemona
return
again
to
venice
iago
o
no
he
goes
into
mauritania
and
takes
away
with
him
the
fair
desdemona
unless
his
abode
be
lingered
here
by
some
accident
wherein
none
can
be
so
determinate
as
the
removing
of
cassio
roderigo
how
do
you
mean
removing
of
him
iago
why
by
making
him
uncapable
of
othello
place
knocking
out
his
brains
roderigo
and
that
you
would
have
me
to
do
iago
ay
if
you

do
yourself
a
profit
and
a
right
he

harlotry
and
thither

i
go
to

along
with
me

such
a
necessity
in
his
death
that
you
shall
think
yourself
bound
to
put
it
on
him
it
is
now
high
and
the
night
grows
to
waste
about
it
roderigo
i

reason
for
this
iago
and
you
shall
be

that
song
tonight
will
not

much
to

but
to
go

women
you

so
get
thee
gone
good
night
mine
eyes
do
itch
doth
that
bode
weeping
emilia
is
neither
here
nor
there
desdemona
i
have
heard
it
said
so
o
these
men
these
men
dost
thou
in
conscience
tell
me
that
there
be
women
do
abuse
their
husbands
in
such
gross
kind
emilia
there
be
some
such
no
question
desdemona
wouldst
thou
do
such
a
deed
for
all
the
world
emilia
why
would
not
you
desdemona
no
by
this
heavenly
light
emilia
nor
i
neither
by
this
heavenly
light
i
might
as
well
i
the
dark
desdemona
wouldst
thou
do
such
a
deed
for
all
the
world
emilia
the
world
a
huge
thing
it
is
a
great
price
for
a
small
vice
desdemona
in
troth
i
think
thou
wouldst
not
emilia
in
troth
i
think
i
should
and
when
i
had
done
marry
i
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
a
nor
for
measures
of
lawn
nor
for
gowns
petticoats
nor
caps
nor
any
petty
exhibition
but
for
the
whole
why
who
would
not
make
her
husband
a
cuckold
to
make
him
a
monarch
i
should
venture
purgatory
desdemona
beshrew
me
if
i
would
do
such
a
wrong
for
the
whole
world
emilia
why
the
wrong
is
but
a
wrong
i
the
world
and
having
the
world
for
your
labor
is
a
wrong
in
your
own
world
and
you
might
quickly
make
it
right
desdemona
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
such
woman
emilia
yes
a
dozen
and
as
many
to
the
vantage
as
would
store
the
world
they
played
for
but
i
do
think
it
is
their
husbands
faults
if
wives
do
fall
say
that
they
slack
their
duties
and
pour
our
treasures
into
foreign
laps
or
else
break
out
in
peevish
jealousies
throwing
restraint
upon
us
or
say
they
strike
us
or
scant
our
former
having
in
despite
why
we
have
galls
and
though
we
have
some
grace
yet
have
we
some
revenge
let
husbands
know
their
wives
have
sense
like
them
they
see
and
smell
and
have
their
palates
both
for
sweet
and
sour
as
husbands
have
what
is
it
that
they
do
when
they
change
us
for
others
is
it
sport
i
think
it
is
and
doth
affection
breed
it
i
think
it
doth
frailty
that
thus
errs
it
is
so
too
and
have
not
we
affections
desires
for
sport
and
frailty
as
men
have
then
let
them
use
us
well
else
let
them
know
the
ills
we
do
their
ills
instruct
us
so

promethean
heat
that

relume
when

it
vital
growth
again
it

almost
persuade
justice
to
break
her

thus
when
thou
art
dead
and
i
will
kill
thee

this
the

so
sweet
was
so
fatal
i
must
weep

yourself
of
any
crime
unreconciled
as

to

and
grace
solicit
for
it
straight
desdemona
alas
my
lord
what
may
you
mean
by
that
othello

do
it
and
be
brief
i
will
walk
by
i
would
not
kill
thy
unprepared
spirit
no
heaven
forfend
i
would
not
kill
thy
soul
desdemona
talk
you
of
killing

on
me
othello

so
i
hope
you
will
not
kill
me
othello
hum
desdemona
and
yet
i
fear
you
for
you
are
fatal
then
when
your
eyes
roll
so
why
i
should
fear
i
know
not
since
guiltiness
i
know
not

yet
i
feel
i
fear
othello
think
on
thy
sins
desdemona
they
are
loves
i
bear
to
you
othello
ay
and
for
that
thou
diest
desdemona
that
death
unnatural
that
kills
for
loving
alas
why
gnaw
you
so
your
nether
lip
some
bloody
passion
shakes
your
very
frame
these
are
portents
but
yet
i
hope
i
hope
they
do
not
point
on
me
othello
peace
and
be
still
desdemona
i
will
so
what
the
matter
othello
that
handkerchief
which
i
so
loved
and
gave
thee
thou
gavest
to
cassio
desdemona
no
by
my
life
and
soul
send
for
the
man
and
ask
him
othello
sweet
soul
take
heed
take
heed
of
perjury
thou
are
on
thy
deathbed
desdemona
ay
but
not
yet
to
die
othello
yes
presently
therefore
confess
thee
freely
of
thy
sin
for
to
deny
each
article
with
oath
can
not
remove
nor
choke
the
strong
conception
that
i
do
groan
withal
thou
art
to
die
desdemona
then

mercy
on
me

might
love

dost
stone
my
heart

makest
me
call
what
i
intend
to
do
a
murther
which
i
thought

so
good
in
the
practice
of
a
damned
slave
what
shall
be

did
i
in
hate
but
all
in

this
wretch
hath
part
confess
his
villainy
did
you
and
he
consent
in
cassio
death
othello
ay
cassio
dear
general
i
never
gave
you
cause
othello
i
do
believe
it
and
i
ask
your
pardon
will
you
i
pray
demand
that
why
he
hath
thus
ensnared
my
soul
and
body
iago
demand

nothing
what
you
know
you
know
from
this
time
forth
i
never

gratiano
torments
will
ope
your
lips
othello
well
thou
dost
best
lodovico
sir
you
shall
understand
what
hath
which
as
i
think
you
know
not
here
is
a
letter
found
in
the
pocket
of
the
slain
roderigo
and
here
another
the
one
of
them
imports
the
death
of
cassio
to
be
undertook
by
roderigo
othello
o
villain
cassio
most
heathenish
and
most
gross
lodovico
now
here
another
discontented
paper
found
in
his
pocket
too
and
this
it
seems
roderigo
meant
to
have
sent
this
damned
villain
but
that
belike
iago
in
the
interim
came
in
and
satisfied
him
othello
o
the
pernicious
caitiff
how
came
you
cassio
by
that
handkerchief
that
was
my
wife
cassio
i
found
it
in
my
chamber
and
he
himself
confess
but
even
now
that
there
he
dropp
it
for
a
special
purpose
which
wrought
to
his
desire
othello
o
fool
fool
fool
cassio
there
is
besides
in
roderigo
letter
how
he
upbraids
iago
that
he
made
him
brave
me
upon
the
watch
whereon
it
came
that
i
was
cast
and
even
but
now
he
spake
after
long
seeming
dead
iago
hurt
him
iago
set
him
on
lodovico
you
must
forsake
this
room
and
go
with
us
your
power
and
your
command
is
taken
off
and
cassio
rules
in
cyprus
for
this
slave
if
there
be
any
cunning
cruelty
that
can
torment
him
much
and
hold
him
long
it
shall
be
his
you
shall
close
prisoner
rest
till
that
the
nature
of
your
fault
be
known
to
the
venetian
state
come
bring
away
othello
soft
you
a
word
or
two
before
you
go
i
have
done
the
state
some
service
and
they
no
more
of
that
i
pray
you
in
your
letters
when
you
shall
these
unlucky
deeds
relate
speak
of
me
as
i
am
nothing
extenuate
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
then
must
you
speak
of
one
that
loved
not
wisely
but
too
well
of
one
not
easily
jealous
but
being
wrought
perplex
in
the
extreme
of
one
whose
hand
like
the
base
indian
threw
a
pearl
away
richer
than
all
his
tribe
of
one
whose
subdued
eyes
albeit
unused
to
the
melting
mood
drop
tears
as
fast
as
the
arabian
trees
their
medicinal
gum
set
you
down
this
and
say
besides
that
in
aleppo
once
where
a
malignant
and
a
turban
turk
beat
a
venetian
and
traduced

took
by
the
throat
the
circumcised
dog
